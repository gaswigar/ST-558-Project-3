statesmen
even
the
greatest
have
rarely
won
the
same
unquestioning
recognition
that
falls
to
the
great
warriors
or
those
supreme
in
science
art
or
literature
not
in
their
own
lifetime
and
hardly
to
this
day
have
the
claims
to
supremacy
of
our
own
oliver
cromwell
william
iii
and
lord
chatham
rested
on
so
sure
a
foundation
as
those
of
a
marlborough
or
a
nelson
a
newton
a
milton
or
a
hogarth
this
is
only
natural
a
warrior
a
man
of
science
an
artist
or
a
poet
are
judged
in
the
main
by
definite
achievements
by
the
victories
they
have
won
over
foreign
enemies
or
over
ignorance
and
prejudice
by
the
joy
and
enlightenment
they
have
brought
to
the
consciousness
of
their
own
and
succeeding
generations
for
the
statesman
there
is
no
such
exact
measure
of
greatness
the
greater
he
is
the
less
likely
is
his
work
to
be
marked
by
decisive
achievement
which
can
be
recalled
by
anniversaries
or
signalised
by
some
outstanding
event
the
chief
work
of
a
great
statesman
rests
in
a
gradual
change
of
direction
given
to
the
policy
of
his
people
still
more
in
a
change
of
the
spirit
within
them
again
the
statesman
must
work
with
a
rough
and
ready
instrument
the
soldier
finds
or
makes
his
army
ready
to
yield
unhesitating
obedience
to
his
commands
the
sailor
animates
his
fleet
with
his
own
personal
touch
and
the
great
man
in
art
literature
or
science
is
master
of
his
material
if
he
can
master
himself
the
statesman
can
not
mould
a
heterogeneous
people
as
the
men
of
a
army
or
navy
can
be
moulded
to
respond
to
his
call
and
his
alone
he
has
to
do
all
his
work
in
a
society
of
which
a
large
part
can
not
see
his
object
and
another
large
part
as
far
as
they
do
see
it
oppose
it
hence
his
work
at
the
best
is
often
incomplete
and
he
has
to
be
satisfied
with
a
rough
average
rather
than
with
his
ideal
lincoln
one
of
the
few
supreme
statesmen
of
the
last
three
centuries
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
he
was
misunderstood
and
underrated
in
his
lifetime
and
even
yet
has
hardly
come
to
his
own
for
his
place
is
among
the
great
men
of
the
earth
to
them
he
belongs
by
right
of
his
immense
power
of
hard
work
his
unfaltering
pursuit
of
what
seemed
to
him
right
and
above
all
by
that
childlike
directness
and
simplicity
of
vision
which
none
but
the
greatest
carry
beyond
their
earliest
years
it
is
fit
that
the
first
considered
attempt
by
an
englishman
to
give
a
picture
of
lincoln
the
great
hero
of
america
struggle
for
the
noblest
cause
should
come
at
a
time
when
we
in
england
are
passing
through
as
fiery
a
trial
for
a
cause
we
feel
to
be
as
noble
it
is
a
time
when
we
may
learn
much
from
lincoln
failures
and
success
from
his
patience
his
modesty
his
serene
optimism
and
his
eloquence
so
simple
and
so
magnificent

chapter
i
boyhood
of
lincoln
the
subject
of
this
memoir
is
revered
by
multitudes
of
his
countrymen
as
the
preserver
of
their
commonwealth
this
reverence
has
grown
with
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
accumulation
of
evidence
it
is
blended
with
a
peculiar
affection
seldom
bestowed
upon
the
memory
of
statesmen
it
is
shared
by
many
who
remember
with
no
less
affection
how
their
own
fathers
fought
against
him
he
died
with
every
circumstance
of
tragedy
yet
it
is
not
the
accident
of
his
death
but
the
purpose
of
his
life
that
is
remembered
readers
of
history
in
another
country
can
not
doubt
that
the
praise
so
given
is
rightly
given
yet
any
bare
record
of
the
american
civil
war
may
leave
them
wondering
why
it
has
been
so
unquestioningly
accorded
the
position
and
task
of
the
american
president
in
that
crisis
can
not
be
understood
from
those
of
other
historic
rulers
or
historic
leaders
of
a
people
and
it
may
seem
as
if
after
that
tremendous
conflict
in
which
there
was
no
lack
of
heroes
some
perverse
whim
had
made
men
single
out
for
glory
the
puzzled
civil
magistrate
who
sat
by
thus
when
an
english
writer
tells
again
this
tale
which
has
been
well
told
already
and
in
which
there
can
remain
no
important
new
facts
to
disclose
he
must
endeavour
to
make
clear
to
englishmen
circumstances
and
conditions
which
are
familiar
to
americans
he
will
incur
the
certainty
that
here
and
there
his
own
perspective
of
american
affairs
and
persons
will
be
false
or
his
own
touch
unsympathetic
he
had
better
do
this
than
chronicle
sayings
and
doings
which
to
him
and
to
those
for
whom
he
writes
have
no
significance
nor
should
the
writer
shrink
too
timidly
from
the
display
of
a
partisanship
which
on
one
side
or
the
other
it
would
be
insensate
not
to
feel
the
true
obligation
of
impartiality
is
that
he
should
conceal
no
fact
which
in
his
own
mind
tells
against
his
views
abraham
lincoln
sixteenth
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
was
born
on
february
in
a
log
cabin
on
a
barren
farm
in
the
backwoods
of
kentucky
about
three
miles
west
of
a
place
called
hodgensville
in
what
is
now
la
rue
county
fifty
years
later
when
he
had
been
nominated
for
the
presidency
he
was
asked
for
material
for
an
account
of
his
early
life
why
he
said
it
is
a
great
folly
to
attempt
to
make
anything
out
of
me
or
my
early
life
it
can
all
be
condensed
into
a
single
sentence
and
that
sentence
you
will
find
in
gray
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
that
my
life
and
that
all
you
or
anyone
else
can
make
out
of
it
his
other
references
to
early
days
were
rare
he
would
repeat
queer
reminiscences
of
the
backwoods
to
illustrate
questions
of
state
but
of
his
own
part
in
that
old
life
he
spoke
reluctantly
and
sadly
nevertheless
there
was
once
extracted
from
him
an
awkward
autobiographical
fragment
and
his
friends
have
collected
and
recorded
concerning
his
earlier
years
quite
as
much
as
is
common
in
great
biographies
or
can
as
a
rule
be
reproduced
with
its
true
associations
thus
there
are
tales
enough
of
the
untaught
student
perseverance
and
of
the
boy
giant
gentleness
and
prowess
tales
too
more
than
enough
in
proportion
of
the
fun
which
varied
but
did
not
pervade
his
existence
and
of
the
young
rustic
occasional
and
somewhat
oafish
pranks
but
in
any
conception
we
may
form
as
to
the
growth
of
his
mind
and
character
this
fact
must
have
its
place
that
to
the
man
himself
the
thought
of
his
early
life
was
unattractive
void
of
over
the
difficulties
which
he
had
conquered
and
void
of
romantic
fondness
for
vanished
joys
of
youth
much
the
same
may
be
said
of
his
ancestry
and
family
connections
contempt
for
lowly
beginnings
abhorrent
as
it
is
to
any
honest
mind
would
to
lincoln
mind
have
probably
been
inconceivable
but
he
lacked
that
interest
in
ancestry
which
is
generally
marked
in
his
countrymen
and
from
talk
of
his
nearer
progenitors
he
seems
to
have
shrunk
with
a
positive
sadness
of
which
some
causes
will
soon
be
apparent
since
his
death
it
has
been
ascertained
that
in
one
samuel
lincoln
of
norwich
emigrated
to
massachusetts
descent
from
him
could
be
claimed
by
a
prosperous
family
in
virginia
several
of
whom
fought
on
the
southern
side
in
the
civil
war
one
abraham
lincoln
grandfather
of
the
president
and
apparently
a
grandson
of
samuel
crossed
the
mountains
from
virginia
in
and
settled
his
family
in
kentucky
of
which
the
nearer
portions
had
recently
been
explored
one
morning
four
years
later
he
was
at
work
near
his
cabin
with
mordecai
josiah
and
thomas
his
sons
when
a
shot
from
the
bushes
near
by
brought
him
down
mordecai
ran
to
the
house
josiah
to
a
fort
which
was
close
to
them
thomas
aged
six
stayed
by
his
father
body
mordecai
seized
a
gun
and
looking
through
the
window
saw
an
indian
in
war
paint
stooping
to
pick
up
thomas
he
fired
and
killed
the
savage
and
when
thomas
had
run
into
the
cabin
continued
firing
at
others
who
appeared
among
the
bushes
shortly
josiah
returned
with
soldiers
from
the
fort
and
the
indians
ran
off
leaving
abraham
the
elder
dead
mordecai
his
prospered
we
hear
of
him
long
after
as
an
old
man
of
substance
and
repute
in
western
illinois
he
had
decided
views
about
indians
the
sight
of
a
redskin
would
move
him
to
strange
excitement
he
would
disappear
into
the
bushes
with
his
gun
and
his
conscience
as
a
son
and
a
sportsman
would
not
be
satisfied
till
he
had
stalked
and
shot
him
we
are
further
informed
that
he
was
a
good
old
man
josiah
also
moved
to
illinois
and
it
is
pleasant
to
learn
that
he
also
was
a
good
old
man
and
as
became
a
good
old
man
prospered
pretty
well
but
president
lincoln
and
his
sister
knew
neither
these
excellent
elders
nor
any
other
of
their
father
kin
and
those
with
whom
the
story
of
his
own
first
years
is
bound
up
invite
almost
as
summary
treatment
thomas
lincoln
never
prospered
like
mordecai
and
josiah
and
never
seems
to
have
left
the
impress
of
his
goodness
or
of
anything
else
on
any
man
but
while
learning
to
carpenter
under
one
joseph
hanks
he
married
his
niece
nancy
and
by
her
became
the
father
first
of
a
daughter
sarah
and
four
years
later
at
the
farm
near
hodgensville
aforesaid
of
abraham
the
future
president
in
after
several
migrations
he
transported
his
household
down
the
ohio
to
a
spot
on
the
indiana
shore
near
which
the
village
of
gentryville
soon
sprang
up
there
he
abode
till
abraham
was
nearly
when
the
boy
was
eight
his
mother
died
leaving
him
in
his
sister
care
but
after
a
year
or
so
thomas
went
back
alone
to
kentucky
and
after
brief
wooing
brought
back
a
wife
sarah
the
widow
of
one
johnston
whom
he
had
courted
vainly
before
her
first
marriage
he
brought
with
her
some
useful
additions
to
his
household
gear
and
her
rather
useless
son
john
johnston
relatives
of
abraham
mother
and
other
old
neighbours
in
particular
john
and
dennis
hanks
accompanied
all
the
family
migrations
ultimately
in
they
all
moved
further
west
into
illinois
meanwhile
abraham
from
an
early
age
did
such
various
tasks
for
his
father
or
for
neighbouring
farmers
as
from
time
to
time
suited
the
father
when
an
older
lad
he
was
put
for
a
while
in
charge
of
a
ferry
boat
and
this
led
to
the
two
great
adventures
of
his
early
days
voyages
with
a
cargo
boat
and
two
mates
down
by
river
to
new
orleans
the
second
and
more
memorable
of
these
voyages
was
just
after
the
migration
to
illinois
he
returned
from
it
to
a
place
called
new
salem
in
illinois
some
distance
from
his
father
new
farm
in
expectation
of
work
in
a
store
which
was
about
to
be
opened
abraham
by
this
time
was
of
age
and
in
accordance
with
custom
had
been
set
free
to
shift
for
himself
each
of
these
migrations
was
effected
with
great
labour
in
transportation
of
baggage
sometimes
in
boats
clearing
of
timber
and
building
and
thomas
lincoln
can
not
have
been
wanting
in
the
capacity
for
great
exertions
but
historians
have
been
inclined
to
be
hard
on
him
he
seems
to
have
been
without
sustained
industry
in
any
case
he
had
not
much
money
sense
and
could
not
turn
his
industry
to
much
account
some
hint
that
he
drank
but
it
is
admitted
that
most
kentucky
men
drank
more
there
are
indications
that
he
was
a
dutiful
but
ineffective
father
chastising
not
too
often
or
too
much
but
generally
on
the
wrong
occasion
he
was
no
scholar
and
did
not
encourage
his
son
that
way
but
he
had
a
great
liking
for
stories
he
was
of
a
peaceable
and
inoffensive
temper
but
on
great
provocation
would
turn
on
a
bully
with
surprising
and
dire
consequences
old
thomas
after
abraham
was
turned
loose
continued
a
migrant
always
towards
a
supposed
better
farm
further
west
always
with
a
mortgage
on
him
abraham
when
he
was
a
struggling
professional
man
helped
him
with
money
as
well
as
he
could
we
have
his
letter
to
the
old
man
on
his
a
letter
of
genuine
but
mild
affection
with
due
words
of
piety
he
explains
that
illness
in
his
own
household
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
pay
a
last
visit
to
his
father
and
then
with
that
curious
directness
which
is
common
in
the
families
of
the
poor
and
has
as
a
rule
no
sting
he
remarks
that
an
interview
if
it
had
been
possible
might
have
given
more
pain
than
pleasure
to
both
everybody
has
insisted
from
the
first
how
little
abraham
took
after
his
father
but
more
than
one
of
the
traits
attributed
to
thomas
will
certainly
reappear
abraham
as
a
man
when
for
once
he
spoke
of
his
mother
whom
he
very
seldom
mentioned
spoke
with
intense
feeling
for
her
motherly
care
i
owe
he
said
everything
that
i
am
to
her
it
pleased
him
in
this
talk
to
explain
by
inheritance
from
her
the
mental
qualities
which
distinguished
him
from
the
house
of
lincoln
and
from
others
of
the
house
of
hanks
she
was
he
said
the
illegitimate
daughter
of
a
virginian
gentleman
whose
name
he
did
not
know
but
from
whom
as
he
guessed
the
peculiar
gifts
of
which
he
could
not
fail
to
be
conscious
were
derived
sarah
his
sister
was
married
at
gentryville
to
one
grigsby
the
grigsbys
were
rather
great
people
as
people
went
in
gentryville
it
is
said
to
have
become
fixed
in
the
boy
mind
that
the
grigsbys
had
not
treated
sarah
well
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
certain
woes
sarah
bush
lincoln
his
stepmother
was
good
to
him
and
he
to
her
above
all
she
encouraged
him
in
his
early
studies
to
which
a
fretful
housewife
could
have
opposed
such
terrible
obstacles
she
lived
to
hope
that
he
might
not
be
elected
president
for
fear
that
enemies
should
kill
him
and
she
lived
to
have
her
fear
fulfilled
his
affectionate
care
over
her
continued
to
the
end
she
lived
latterly
with
her
son
john
johnston
abraham
later
letters
to
this
companion
of
his
youth
deserve
to
be
looked
up
in
the
eight
large
volumes
called
his
works
for
it
is
hard
to
see
how
a
man
could
speak
or
act
better
to
an
impecunious
friend
who
would
not
face
his
own
troubles
squarely
it
is
sad
that
the
ever
your
affectionate
brother
of
the
earlier
letters
declines
to
yours
sincerely
in
the
last
but
it
is
an
honest
decline
of
affection
for
the
man
had
proved
to
be
cheating
his
mother
and
abraham
had
had
to
stop
it
two
of
the
cousinhood
dennis
hanks
a
character
of
comedy
and
john
hanks
the
serious
and
steady
character
of
the
connection
deserve
mention
they
and
john
johnston
make
momentary
reappearances
again
otherwise
the
whole
of
abraham
lincoln
kindred
are
now
out
of
the
story
they
have
been
disposed
of
thus
hastily
at
the
outset
not
because
they
were
discreditable
or
slight
people
but
because
lincoln
himself
when
he
began
to
find
his
footing
in
the
world
seems
to
have
felt
sadly
that
his
family
was
just
so
much
to
him
and
no
more
the
dearest
of
his
recollections
attached
to
premature
death
the
next
to
chronic
failure
rightly
or
wrongly
and
we
know
enough
about
heredity
now
to
expect
any
guess
as
to
its
working
in
a
particular
case
to
be
wrong
he
attributed
the
best
that
he
had
inherited
to
a
licentious
connection
and
a
nameless
progenitor
quite
early
he
must
have
been
intensely
ambitious
and
discovered
in
himself
intellectual
power
but
from
his
twelfth
year
to
his
there
was
hardly
a
soul
to
comprehend
that
side
of
him
this
chill
upon
his
memory
unmistakably
influenced
the
particular
complexion
of
his
melancholy
unmistakably
too
he
early
learnt
to
think
that
he
was
odd
that
his
oddity
was
connected
with
his
strength
that
he
might
be
destined
to
stand
alone
and
capable
of
so
standing
the
life
of
the
farming
pioneer
in
what
was
then
the
far
west
afforded
a
fair
prospect
of
laborious
independence
but
at
least
till
lincoln
was
grown
up
when
a
time
of
rapid
growth
and
change
set
in
it
offered
no
hope
of
quickly
gotten
wealth
and
it
imposed
severe
hardship
on
all
the
country
was
thickly
wooded
the
settler
had
before
him
at
the
outset
heavy
toil
in
clearing
the
ground
and
in
building
some
rude
shelter
a
house
or
just
a
camp
that
is
a
shed
with
one
side
open
to
the
weather
such
as
that
in
which
the
lincoln
family
passed
their
first
winter
near
gentryville
the
site
once
chosen
and
the
clearing
once
made
there
was
no
such
ease
of
cultivation
or
such
certain
fertility
as
later
settlers
found
yet
further
west
when
the
development
of
railways
of
agricultural
machinery
and
of
eastern
or
european
markets
had
opened
out
to
cultivation
the
enormous
stretches
of
level
grass
plain
beyond
the
mississippi
till
population
had
grown
a
good
deal
pioneer
families
were
largely
occupied
in
producing
for
themselves
with
their
own
hands
what
in
their
hardy
if
not
always
frugal
view
were
the
necessities
and
comforts
of
life
they
had
no
eastern
market
for
their
produce
for
railways
did
not
begin
to
be
made
till
and
it
was
many
years
before
they
crossed
the
eastern
mountains
an
occasional
cargo
was
taken
on
a
boat
down
the
nearest
creek
as
a
stream
is
called
in
america
into
the
ohio
and
so
by
the
innumerable
windings
of
the
mississippi
to
new
orleans
but
no
return
cargo
could
be
brought
up
stream
knives
and
axes
were
the
most
precious
objects
to
be
gained
by
trade
woollen
fabrics
were
rare
in
the
west
when
lincoln
was
born
and
the
white
man
and
woman
like
the
red
whom
they
had
displaced
were
chiefly
dressed
in
deer
skins
the
woods
abounded
in
game
and
in
the
early
stages
of
the
development
of
the
west
a
man
could
largely
support
himself
by
his
gun
the
cold
of
every
winter
is
there
great
and
an
occasional
winter
made
itself
long
remembered
like
the
winter
of
the
deep
snow
in
illinois
by
the
havoc
of
its
sudden
onset
and
the
suffering
of
its
long
duration
the
settling
of
a
forest
country
was
accompanied
here
as
elsewhere
by
the
occasional
ravages
of
strange
and
destructive
pestilences
and
the
constant
presence
of
malaria
population
was
soon
thick
enough
for
occasional
gatherings
convivial
or
religious
and
in
either
case
apt
to
be
wild
but
for
long
it
was
not
thick
enough
for
the
life
of
most
settlers
to
be
other
than
lonely
as
well
as
hard
abraham
lincoln
in
his
teens
grew
very
fast
and
by
nineteen
he
was
nearly
six
foot
four
his
weight
was
never
quite
proportionate
to
this
his
ungainly
figure
with
long
arms
and
large
hands
and
relatively
small
development
of
chest
and
the
strange
lineaments
of
his
face
were
perhaps
the
evidence
of
unfit
sometimes
insufficient
food
in
these
years
of
growth
but
his
muscular
strength
was
great
and
startling
statistical
tales
are
told
of
the
weight
he
could
lift
and
the
force
of
his
blows
with
a
mallet
or
an
axe
to
a
gentle
and
thoughtful
boy
with
secret
ambition
in
him
such
strength
is
a
great
gift
and
in
such
surroundings
most
obviously
so
lincoln
as
a
lad
was
a
valuable
workman
at
the
varied
tasks
that
came
his
way
without
needing
that
intense
application
to
manual
pursuits
which
the
bent
of
his
mind
made
irksome
to
him
and
he
was
a
person
of
high
consideration
among
the
lads
of
his
age
and
company
the
manners
of
the
people
then
settling
in
indiana
and
illinois
had
not
the
extreme
ferocity
for
which
kentucky
had
earlier
been
famous
and
which
crops
up
here
and
there
in
frontier
life
elsewhere
all
the
same
as
might
naturally
be
supposed
they
shared
plato
opinion
that
youths
and
men
in
the
prime
of
life
should
settle
their
differences
with
their
fists
young
lincoln
few
serious
combats
were
satisfactorily
decisive
and
neither
they
nor
his
friendly
wrestling
bouts
ended
in
the
quarrels
which
were
too
common
among
his
neighbours
thus
for
all
his
originality
and
oddity
he
early
grew
accustomed
to
mix
in
the
sort
of
company
he
was
likely
to
meet
without
either
inward
shrinking
or
the
need
of
conscious
in
one
thing
he
stood
aloof
from
the
sports
of
his
fellows
most
backwoodsmen
were
bred
to
the
gun
he
has
told
us
that
he
shot
a
turkey
when
he
was
eight
and
never
afterwards
shot
at
all
there
is
an
early
tale
of
his
protests
against
an
aimless
slaughter
of
mud
turtles
and
it
may
be
guessed
that
the
dislike
of
all
killing
which
gave
him
sore
trouble
later
began
when
he
was
young
tales
survive
of
his
kindness
to
helpless
men
and
animals
it
marks
the
real
hardness
of
his
surroundings
and
their
hardening
effect
on
many
that
his
exertions
in
saving
a
drunken
man
from
death
in
the
snow
are
related
with
apparent
surprise
some
tales
of
his
helping
a
pig
stuck
in
a
bog
or
a
dog
on
an
ice
floe
and
the
like
seem
to
indicate
a
curious
and
lasting
trait
these
things
seem
not
to
have
been
done
spontaneously
but
on
mature
reflection
after
he
had
passed
unheeding
by
he
grew
to
be
a
man
of
prompt
action
in
circumstances
of
certain
kinds
but
generally
his
impulse
was
slow
and
not
very
sure
taste
and
the
minor
sensibilities
were
a
little
deficient
in
him
as
a
lady
once
candidly
explained
to
him
he
was
not
ready
with
little
gracious
acts
but
rare
occasions
such
as
can
arouse
a
passionate
sense
of
justice
would
kindle
his
slow
kind
nature
with
a
sudden
fire
the
total
amount
of
his
schooling
at
the
several
brief
periods
for
which
there
happened
to
have
been
a
school
accessible
and
facility
to
get
to
it
was
afterwards
computed
by
himself
at
something
under
twelve
months
with
this
slight
help
distributed
over
the
years
from
his
eighth
to
his
fifteenth
birthday
he
taught
himself
to
read
write
and
do
sums
the
stories
of
the
effort
and
painful
shifts
by
which
great
men
accomplish
this
initial
labour
almost
unhelped
have
in
all
cases
the
same
pathos
and
have
a
certain
sameness
in
detail
having
learnt
to
read
he
had
the
following
books
within
his
reach
the
bible
aesop
fables
robinson
crusoe
the
pilgrim
progress
a
history
of
the
united
states
and
weems
life
of
washington
later
on
the
fancy
took
him
to
learn
the
laws
of
his
state
and
he
obtained
the
laws
of
indiana
these
books
he
did
read
and
read
again
and
pondered
not
with
any
dreamy
or
purely
intellectual
interest
but
like
one
who
desires
the
weapon
of
learning
for
practical
ends
and
desires
also
to
have
patterns
of
what
life
should
be
as
already
said
his
service
as
a
labourer
could
be
considerable
and
when
something
stirred
his
ambition
to
do
a
task
quickly
his
energy
could
be
prodigious
but
bone
idle
is
what
i
called
him
was
the
verdict
long
after
of
one
perhaps
too
critical
employer
i
found
him
he
said
cocked
up
on
a
haystack
with
a
book
are
you
reading
i
said
not
reading
i
studying
says
he
are
you
studying
says
i
says
he
as
proud
as
cicero
god
almighty
said
i
the
boy
correction
studying
for
reading
was
impertinent
but
probably
sound
to
be
equally
sound
we
must
reckon
among
his
educational
facilities
the
abundant
stories
which
came
his
way
in
a
community
which
however
unlettered
was
certainly
not
the
occasional
newspaper
the
rare
lectures
or
political
meetings
the
much
more
frequent
religious
meetings
with
preachers
who
taught
a
grim
doctrine
but
who
preached
with
vigour
and
sometimes
with
the
deepest
sincerity
the
hymns
often
of
great
emotional
power
over
a
simple
congregation
cowper
there
is
a
fountain
filled
with
blood
is
one
recorded
favourite
among
them
the
songs
far
other
than
hymns
which
dennis
hanks
and
his
other
mates
would
pick
up
or
compose
and
the
practice
in
rhetoric
and
the
art
of
exposition
which
he
unblushingly
afforded
himself
before
audiences
of
fellow
labourers
who
welcomed
the
jest
and
the
excuse
for
stopping
work
the
achievement
of
the
man
remains
wonderful
but
if
he
surmounts
his
difficulties
at
all
some
of
his
limitations
may
turn
to
sheer
advantage
there
is
some
advantage
merely
in
being
driven
to
make
the
most
of
few
books
great
advantage
in
having
one
choice
restricted
by
circumstances
to
good
books
great
advantage
too
in
the
consciousness
of
untrained
faculty
which
leaves
a
man
capable
in
mature
life
of
deliberately
undertaking
mental
discipline
along
with
the
legends
and
authentic
records
of
his
signs
of
an
ambition
which
showed
itself
early
and
which
was
from
the
first
a
clean
and
a
high
ambition
there
are
also
other
legends
showing
lincoln
as
a
naughty
boy
among
naughty
boys
the
selection
here
made
from
these
lacks
refinement
and
the
reader
must
note
that
this
was
literally
a
big
naughty
boy
not
a
man
who
had
grown
stiff
in
coarseness
and
first
it
must
be
recalled
that
abraham
bore
a
grudge
against
the
grigsbys
an
honourable
grudge
in
its
origin
and
perhaps
the
only
grudge
he
ever
bore
there
had
arisen
from
this
a
combat
of
which
the
details
might
displease
the
fastidious
but
which
was
noble
in
so
far
that
abraham
rescued
a
weaker
combatant
who
was
but
there
ensued
something
more
displeasing
a
series
of
lampoons
by
abraham
in
prose
and
a
kind
of
verse
these
were
gross
and
silly
enough
though
probably
to
the
taste
of
the
public
which
he
then
addressed
but
it
is
the
sequel
that
matters
in
a
work
called
the
first
chronicles
of
reuben
it
is
related
how
reuben
and
josiah
the
sons
of
reuben
grigsby
the
elder
took
to
themselves
wives
on
the
same
day
by
local
custom
the
bridal
feast
took
place
and
the
two
young
couples
began
their
married
careers
under
the
roof
of
the
bridegrooms
father
moreover
it
was
the
custom
that
at
a
certain
stage
in
the
celebrations
the
brides
should
be
escorted
to
their
chambers
by
hired
attendants
who
shortly
after
conducted
the
bridegrooms
thither
on
this
occasion
some
sense
of
mischief
afoot
disturbed
the
heart
of
reuben
grigsby
the
elder
and
hastening
upstairs
just
after
the
attendants
had
returned
she
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
and
to
the
great
consternation
of
all
concerned
why
reuben
you
in
bed
with
the
wrong
wife
the
historian
who
to
the
manifest
annoyance
of
lincoln
other
biographers
has
preserved
this
and
much
other
priceless
information
infers
that
abraham
who
was
not
invited
to
the
feast
had
plotted
this
domestic
catastrophe
and
won
over
the
attendants
to
his
evil
purpose
this
is
not
a
certain
inference
nor
is
it
absolutely
beyond
doubt
that
the
event
recorded
in
the
first
chronicles
of
reuben
ever
happened
at
all
what
is
certain
is
that
these
chronicles
themselves
composed
in
what
purports
to
be
the
style
of
scripture
were
circulated
for
the
joint
edification
of
the
proud
race
of
grigsby
and
of
their
envious
neighbours
in
the
handwriting
of
abraham
lincoln
then
between
seventeen
and
eighteen
not
without
reason
does
an
earlier
manuscript
of
the
same
author
conclude
after
several
correct
exercises
in
compound
subtraction
with
the
distich
abraham
lincoln
his
hand
and
pen
he
will
be
good
but
god
knows
when
not
to
be
too
solemn
about
a
tale
which
has
here
been
told
for
the
whimsical
fancy
of
its
unseemliness
and
because
it
is
probably
the
worst
that
there
is
to
tell
we
may
here
look
forward
and
face
the
fact
that
the
unseemliness
in
talk
of
rough
rustic
boys
flavoured
the
great
president
conversation
through
life
it
is
well
to
be
plain
about
this
lincoln
was
quite
without
any
elegant
and
sentimental
dissoluteness
such
as
can
be
attractively
portrayed
his
life
was
austere
and
seems
to
have
been
so
from
the
start
he
had
that
shy
reverence
for
womanhood
which
is
sometimes
acquired
as
easily
in
rough
as
in
polished
surroundings
and
often
quite
as
steadily
maintained
the
testimony
of
his
early
companions
along
with
some
fragments
of
the
boy
feeble
but
sincere
attempts
at
verse
shows
that
he
acquired
it
young
but
a
large
part
of
the
stories
and
pithy
sayings
for
which
he
was
famous
wherever
he
went
but
of
which
when
their
setting
is
lost
it
is
impossible
to
recover
the
enjoyment
were
undeniably
coarse
and
naturally
enough
this
fact
was
jarring
to
some
of
those
in
america
who
most
revered
him
it
should
not
really
be
hard
in
any
comprehensive
view
of
his
character
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
unfolded
itself
to
trace
in
this
bent
of
his
humour
something
not
discordant
with
the
widening
sympathy
and
deepening
tenderness
of
his
nature
the
words
of
his
political
associate
in
illinois
leonard
swett
afterwards
of
the
united
states
may
suffice
he
writes
almost
any
man
who
will
tell
a
very
vulgar
story
has
in
a
degree
a
vulgar
mind
but
it
was
not
so
with
him
with
all
his
purity
of
character
and
exalted
morality
and
sensibility
which
no
man
can
doubt
when
hunting
for
wit
he
had
no
ability
to
discriminate
between
the
vulgar
and
refined
substances
from
which
he
extracted
it
it
was
the
wit
he
was
after
the
pure
jewel
and
he
would
pick
it
up
out
of
the
mud
or
dirt
just
as
readily
as
from
a
parlour
table
in
any
case
his
best
remembered
utterances
of
this
order
when
least
fit
for
print
were
both
wise
and
incomparably
witty
and
in
any
case
they
did
not
prevent
grave
gentlemen
who
marvelled
at
them
rather
uncomfortably
from
receiving
the
deep
impression
of
what
they
called
his
one
last
recollection
of
lincoln
boyhood
has
appealed
beyond
any
other
to
some
of
his
friends
as
prophetic
of
things
to
come
mention
has
already
been
made
of
his
two
long
trips
down
the
mississippi
with
the
novel
responsibilities
which
they
threw
on
him
and
the
novel
sights
and
company
which
he
met
all
the
way
to
the
strange
distant
city
of
new
orleans
they
must
have
been
great
experiences
only
two
incidents
of
them
are
recorded
in
the
first
voyage
he
and
his
mates
had
been
disturbed
at
night
by
a
band
of
negro
marauders
and
had
had
a
sharp
fight
in
repelling
them
but
in
the
second
voyage
he
met
with
the
negro
in
a
way
that
to
him
was
more
memorable
he
and
the
young
fellows
with
him
saw
among
the
sights
of
new
orleans
negroes
chained
maltreated
whipped
and
scourged
they
came
in
their
rambles
upon
a
slave
auction
where
a
fine
mulatto
girl
was
being
pinched
and
prodded
and
trotted
up
and
down
the
room
like
a
horse
to
show
how
she
moved
that
bidders
might
satisfy
themselves
as
the
auctioneer
said
of
the
soundness
of
the
article
to
be
sold
john
johnston
and
john
hanks
and
abraham
lincoln
saw
these
sights
with
the
unsophisticated
eyes
of
honest
country
lads
from
a
free
state
in
their
home
circle
it
seems
that
slavery
was
always
spoken
of
with
horror
one
of
them
had
a
tenacious
memory
and
a
tenacious
will
lincoln
saw
it
john
hanks
said
long
after
and
other
men
recollections
of
lincoln
talk
confirmed
him
lincoln
saw
it
his
heart
bled
said
nothing
much
was
silent
i
can
say
knowing
it
that
it
was
on
this
trip
that
he
formed
his
opinion
of
slavery
it
ran
its
iron
into
him
then
and
there
may
i
have
heard
him
say
so
often
perhaps
in
other
talks
old
john
hanks
dramatised
his
early
remembrances
a
little
he
related
how
at
the
slave
auction
lincoln
said
by
god
boys
let
get
away
from
this
if
ever
i
get
a
chance
to
hit
that
thing
i
hit
it
hard
the
youth
who
probably
did
not
express
his
indignation
in
these
prophetic
words
was
in
fact
chosen
to
deal
that
thing
a
blow
from
which
it
seems
unlikely
to
recover
as
a
permitted
institution
among
civilised
men
and
it
is
certain
that
from
this
early
time
the
thought
of
slavery
never
ceased
to
be
hateful
to
him
yet
it
is
not
in
the
light
of
a
crusader
against
this
special
evil
that
we
are
to
regard
him
when
he
came
back
from
this
voyage
to
his
new
home
in
illinois
he
was
simply
a
youth
ambitious
of
an
honourable
part
in
the
life
of
the
young
country
of
which
he
was
proud
we
may
regard
and
he
himself
regarded
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
which
will
always
be
associated
with
his
name
as
a
part
of
a
larger
work
the
restoration
of
his
country
to
its
earliest
and
noblest
tradition
which
alone
gave
permanence
or
worth
to
its
existence
as
a
nation
chapter
ii
the
growth
of
the
american
nation
formation
of
a
national
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
understand
the
life
of
a
politician
in
another
country
without
study
of
its
conditions
and
its
past
in
the
case
of
america
this
study
is
especially
necessary
not
only
because
the
many
points
of
comparison
between
that
country
and
our
own
are
apt
to
conceal
profound
differences
of
customs
and
institutions
but
because
the
broader
difference
between
a
new
country
and
an
old
is
in
many
respects
more
important
than
we
conceive
but
in
the
case
of
lincoln
there
is
peculiar
reason
for
carrying
such
a
study
far
back
he
himself
appealed
unceasingly
to
a
tradition
of
the
past
in
tracing
the
causes
which
up
to
his
time
had
tended
to
conjoin
the
united
states
more
closely
and
the
cause
which
more
recently
had
begun
to
threaten
them
with
disruption
we
shall
be
examining
the
elements
of
the
problem
with
which
it
was
his
work
in
life
to
deal
the
thirteen
united
states
of
america
which
in
declared
their
independence
of
great
britain
were
so
many
distinct
colonies
distributed
unevenly
along
miles
of
the
atlantic
coast
these
thirteen
colonies
can
easily
be
identified
on
the
map
when
it
is
explained
that
maine
in
the
extreme
north
was
then
an
unsettled
forest
tract
claimed
by
the
colony
of
massachusetts
that
florida
in
the
extreme
south
belonged
to
spain
and
that
vermont
which
soon
after
asserted
its
separate
existence
was
a
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
almost
every
one
of
these
colonies
had
its
marked
peculiarities
and
its
points
of
antagonism
as
against
its
nearest
neighbours
but
they
fell
into
three
groups
we
may
broadly
contrast
the
five
southernmost
which
included
those
which
were
the
richest
and
of
which
in
many
ways
the
leading
state
was
virginia
with
the
four
or
later
six
northernmost
states
known
collectively
as
new
england
both
groups
had
at
first
been
colonised
by
the
same
class
the
smaller
landed
gentry
of
england
with
a
sprinkling
of
traders
though
the
south
received
later
a
larger
number
of
poor
and
shiftless
immigrants
than
the
north
and
the
north
attracted
a
larger
number
of
artisans
the
physical
conditions
of
the
south
led
to
the
growth
of
large
farms
or
plantations
as
they
were
called
and
of
a
class
of
large
proprietors
negro
slaves
thrived
there
and
were
useful
in
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
indigo
rice
and
later
of
cotton
the
north
continued
to
be
a
country
of
small
farms
but
its
people
turned
also
to
fishery
and
to
commerce
and
the
sea
carrying
trade
became
early
its
predominant
interest
yielding
place
later
on
to
manufacturing
industries
the
south
was
attached
in
the
main
though
by
no
means
altogether
to
the
church
of
england
new
england
owed
its
origin
to
successive
immigrations
of
puritans
often
belonging
to
the
congregational
or
independent
body
with
the
honourable
exception
of
rhode
island
these
communities
showed
none
of
the
liberal
and
tolerant
spirit
which
the
independents
of
the
old
country
often
developed
they
manifested
however
the
frequent
virtues
as
well
as
the
occasional
defects
of
the
puritan
character
the
middle
group
of
colonies
were
of
more
mixed
origin
new
york
and
new
jersey
had
been
dutch
possessions
delaware
was
partly
swedish
pennsylvania
had
begun
as
a
quaker
settlement
but
included
many
different
elements
in
physical
and
economic
conditions
they
resembled
on
the
whole
new
england
but
they
lacked
some
of
them
conspicuously
the
puritan
discipline
and
had
a
certain
cosmopolitan
character
though
there
were
sharp
antagonisms
among
the
northern
settlements
and
the
southern
settlements
were
kept
distinct
by
the
great
distances
between
them
the
tendency
of
events
was
to
soften
these
minor
differences
but
it
greatly
intensified
one
broad
distinction
which
marked
off
the
southern
group
from
the
middle
and
the
northern
groups
equally
nevertheless
before
independence
was
thought
of
there
were
common
characteristics
distinguishing
americans
from
english
people
they
are
the
better
worth
an
attempt
to
note
them
because
as
a
historian
of
america
wrote
some
years
ago
the
typical
american
of
is
on
the
whole
more
like
his
ancestor
of
than
is
the
typical
englishman
in
all
the
colonies
alike
the
conditions
of
life
encouraged
personal
independence
in
all
alike
they
also
encouraged
a
special
kind
of
ability
which
may
be
called
practical
rather
than
thorough
that
of
a
workman
who
must
be
competent
at
many
tasks
and
has
neither
opportunity
nor
inducement
to
become
perfect
at
one
that
of
the
scientific
man
irresistibly
drawn
to
inventions
which
shall
make
life
less
hard
that
of
the
scholar
or
philosopher
who
must
supply
the
new
community
need
of
lawyers
and
politicians
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
colonists
forefathers
had
come
to
their
new
home
with
distinct
aspirations
for
a
better
ordering
of
human
life
than
the
old
world
allowed
and
it
has
frequently
been
noticed
that
americans
from
the
first
have
been
more
prone
than
their
kinsmen
in
england
to
pay
homage
to
large
ideal
conceptions
this
is
a
disposition
not
entirely
favourable
to
painstaking
and
reform
the
idealist
american
is
perhaps
too
ready
to
pay
himself
with
fine
words
which
the
subtler
and
shyer
englishman
avoids
and
rather
too
readily
sets
down
as
insincere
in
others
moreover
this
tendency
is
quite
consistent
with
the
peculiar
conservatism
characteristic
of
america
new
conditions
in
which
tradition
gave
no
guidance
called
forth
great
inventive
powers
and
bred
a
certain
pride
in
novelty
an
american
economist
has
written
in
a
sanguine
humour
the
process
of
transplanting
removes
many
of
the
shackles
of
custom
and
tradition
which
retard
the
progress
of
older
countries
in
a
new
country
things
can
not
be
done
in
the
old
way
and
therefore
they
are
probably
done
in
the
best
way
but
a
new
country
is
always
apt
to
cling
with
tenacity
to
those
old
things
for
which
it
still
has
use
and
a
remote
and
undeveloped
country
does
not
fully
share
the
continual
commerce
in
ideas
which
brings
about
change
and
in
the
main
advance
in
the
old
world
the
conservatism
which
these
causes
tend
to
produce
has
in
any
case
been
marked
in
america
thus
as
readers
of
lowell
are
aware
in
spite
of
the
ceaseless
efflorescence
of
the
modern
slang
of
america
the
language
of
america
is
in
many
respects
that
of
an
older
england
than
ours
and
the
like
has
all
along
been
true
of
important
literature
and
still
more
of
oratory
in
america
moreover
as
the
sentences
which
have
just
been
quoted
may
suggest
the
maxim
that
has
once
hit
the
occasion
or
the
new
practice
or
expedient
once
necessitated
by
the
conditions
of
the
moment
has
been
readily
hallowed
as
expressing
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
an
englishman
will
quote
burke
as
he
would
quote
demosthenes
or
plato
but
americans
have
been
apt
to
quote
their
elder
statesmen
as
they
would
quote
the
bible
in
like
manner
political
practices
of
accidental
origin
for
instance
that
a
representative
should
be
an
inhabitant
of
the
place
he
represents
acquire
in
america
something
like
the
force
of
constitutional
law
in
this
connection
we
must
recall
the
period
at
which
the
earliest
settlers
came
from
england
and
the
political
heritage
which
they
consequently
brought
with
them
this
heritage
included
a
certain
aptitude
for
local
government
which
was
fostered
in
the
south
by
the
rise
of
a
class
of
large
landowners
and
in
the
north
by
the
congregational
church
system
it
included
also
a
great
tenacity
of
the
subject
rights
as
against
the
state
the
spirit
of
hampden
refusing
payment
of
and
a
disposition
to
look
on
the
law
and
the
courts
as
the
bulwarks
of
such
rights
against
government
but
it
did
not
include
and
this
explains
the
real
meaning
of
the
war
of
independence
any
sort
of
feeling
of
allegiance
to
a
parliament
which
represented
great
britain
only
and
which
had
gained
its
position
even
in
great
britain
since
the
fathers
of
virginia
and
massachusetts
left
home
nor
did
it
include
and
this
was
of
great
importance
in
its
influence
on
the
form
of
the
constitution
any
real
understanding
of
or
any
aptitude
for
the
english
parliamentary
government
under
which
the
leaders
of
the
legislative
body
and
the
advisers
of
the
crown
in
its
executive
functions
are
the
same
men
and
under
which
the
elected
persons
presumed
for
the
moment
to
represent
the
people
are
allowed
for
that
moment
an
almost
unfettered
supremacy
thus
there
was
much
that
made
it
easy
for
the
colonies
to
combine
in
the
single
act
of
repudiating
british
sovereignty
yet
the
characteristics
which
may
be
ascribed
to
them
in
common
were
not
such
as
inclined
them
or
fitted
them
to
build
up
a
great
new
unity
the
colonies
however
backed
up
by
the
british
government
with
the
vigour
which
chatham
imparted
to
it
had
acted
together
against
a
common
danger
from
the
french
when
the
states
as
we
must
now
call
them
acted
together
against
the
british
government
they
did
so
in
name
as
united
states
and
they
shortly
proceeded
to
draw
up
articles
of
confederation
and
perpetual
union
but
it
was
union
of
a
feeble
kind
the
separate
government
of
each
state
in
its
internal
affairs
was
easy
to
provide
for
representative
institutions
always
existed
and
no
more
change
was
needed
than
to
substitute
elected
officers
for
the
governors
and
councillors
formerly
appointed
by
the
crown
for
the
union
a
congress
was
provided
which
was
to
represent
all
the
states
in
dealings
with
the
outside
world
but
it
was
a
government
with
no
effective
powers
except
such
as
each
separate
state
might
independently
choose
to
lend
it
it
might
wage
war
with
england
but
it
could
not
effectually
control
or
regularly
pay
the
military
service
of
its
own
citizens
it
might
make
a
treaty
of
peace
with
england
but
it
could
not
enforce
on
its
citizens
distasteful
obligations
of
that
treaty
such
an
machine
would
have
worked
well
enough
for
a
time
if
the
union
government
could
have
attached
to
itself
popular
sentiments
of
honour
and
loyalty
but
the
sentiments
were
not
there
and
it
worked
badly
when
once
we
were
reconciled
to
a
defeat
which
proved
good
for
us
it
became
a
tradition
among
english
writers
to
venerate
the
american
revolution
later
english
historians
have
revolted
from
this
indiscriminate
veneration
they
insist
on
another
side
of
the
facts
on
the
hopelessness
of
the
american
cause
but
for
the
commanding
genius
of
washington
and
his
moral
authority
and
for
the
command
which
france
and
spain
obtained
of
the
seas
on
the
petty
quarrelsomeness
with
which
the
rights
of
the
colonists
were
urged
and
the
meanly
skilful
agitation
which
forced
on
the
final
rupture
on
the
lack
of
sustained
patriotic
effort
during
the
war
on
the
base
cruelty
and
dishonesty
with
which
the
loyal
minority
were
persecuted
and
the
private
rights
guaranteed
by
the
peace
ignored
it
does
not
concern
us
to
ascertain
the
precise
justice
in
this
displeasing
picture
no
man
now
regrets
the
main
result
of
the
revolution
and
we
know
that
a
new
country
is
a
new
country
and
that
there
was
much
in
the
circumstances
of
the
war
to
encourage
indiscipline
and
ferocity
but
the
fact
that
there
is
cause
for
such
an
indictment
bears
in
two
ways
upon
our
present
subject
in
the
first
place
there
has
been
a
tendency
both
in
england
and
in
america
to
look
at
this
history
upside
down
the
epoch
of
the
revolution
and
the
constitution
has
been
regarded
as
a
heroic
age
wherein
lived
the
elder
brutus
mucius
scaevola
claelia
and
the
rest
to
be
followed
by
almost
continuous
disappointment
disillusionment
and
decline
a
more
pleasing
and
more
bracing
view
is
nearer
to
the
historic
truth
the
faults
of
a
later
time
were
largely
survivals
and
the
later
history
is
largely
that
of
growth
though
in
the
face
of
terrific
obstacles
and
many
influences
that
favoured
decay
the
nobility
of
the
revolution
in
the
eighteenth
century
may
be
rated
higher
or
lower
but
in
the
civil
war
in
which
the
elder
brothers
of
so
many
men
now
living
bore
their
part
the
people
of
the
north
and
of
the
south
alike
displayed
far
more
heroic
qualities
in
the
second
place
the
war
of
independence
and
of
the
revolution
lacked
some
of
the
characteristics
of
other
national
uprisings
it
was
not
a
revolt
against
grievous
oppression
or
against
a
wholly
foreign
domination
but
against
a
political
system
which
the
people
mildly
resented
and
which
only
statesmen
felt
to
be
pernicious
and
found
to
be
past
cure
the
cause
appealed
to
political
aspiration
and
appealed
also
to
turbulent
and
ambitious
spirits
and
to
whatever
was
present
of
a
merely
revolutionary
temper
but
the
ordinary
man
who
minded
his
own
business
was
not
greatly
moved
one
way
or
the
other
in
his
heart
the
subsequent
movement
which
in
a
few
years
after
independence
was
secured
gave
the
united
states
a
national
and
a
working
constitution
was
altogether
the
work
of
a
few
to
which
popular
movement
contributed
nothing
of
popular
aspiration
for
unity
there
was
none
statesmen
knew
that
the
new
nation
or
group
of
nations
lay
helpless
between
pressing
dangers
from
abroad
and
its
own
financial
difficulties
they
saw
clearly
that
they
must
create
a
government
of
the
union
which
could
exercise
directly
upon
the
individual
american
citizen
an
authority
like
that
of
the
government
of
his
own
state
they
did
this
but
with
a
reluctant
and
public
opinion
behind
them
the
makers
of
the
constitution
earned
in
a
manner
the
full
praise
that
has
ever
since
been
bestowed
on
them
but
they
did
not
as
it
has
often
been
suggested
they
did
create
a
sort
of
archetype
and
pattern
for
all
governments
that
may
hereafter
partake
of
a
federal
character
nor
has
the
curious
machine
which
they
devised
with
its
balanced
opposition
between
two
legislative
chambers
between
the
whole
legislature
and
the
independent
executive
power
of
the
president
between
the
governing
power
of
the
moment
and
the
permanent
expression
of
the
people
will
embodied
in
certain
almost
unalterable
laws
worked
conspicuously
better
than
other
political
constitutions
the
american
constitution
owes
its
peculiarities
partly
to
the
form
which
the
state
governments
had
naturally
taken
and
partly
to
sheer
misunderstanding
of
the
british
constitution
but
much
more
to
the
want
at
the
time
of
any
strong
sense
of
national
unity
and
to
the
existence
of
a
good
deal
of
dislike
to
all
government
whatsoever
the
sufficient
merit
of
its
founders
was
that
of
patient
and
skilful
diplomatists
who
undeterred
by
difficulties
found
out
the
most
satisfactory
settlement
that
had
a
chance
of
being
accepted
by
the
states
so
the
colonies
which
in
had
declared
their
independence
of
great
britain
under
the
name
of
the
united
states
of
america
entered
in
into
the
possession
of
machinery
of
government
under
which
their
unity
and
independence
could
be
maintained
it
will
be
well
at
once
to
describe
those
features
of
the
constitution
which
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
later
to
bear
in
mind
it
is
generally
known
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
an
elected
officer
elected
by
what
operates
though
intended
to
act
otherwise
as
a
popular
vote
during
the
four
years
of
his
office
he
might
roughly
be
said
to
combine
the
functions
of
the
king
in
this
country
and
those
of
a
prime
minister
whose
cabinet
is
in
due
subjection
to
him
but
that
description
needs
one
very
important
qualification
he
wields
with
certain
slight
restrictions
the
whole
executive
power
of
government
but
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
ministers
can
like
the
ministers
of
our
king
sit
or
speak
in
the
legislature
nor
can
he
like
our
king
dissolve
that
legislature
he
has
indeed
a
veto
on
acts
of
congress
which
can
only
be
overridden
by
a
large
majority
in
both
houses
but
the
executive
and
the
legislative
powers
in
america
were
purposely
so
constituted
as
to
be
independent
of
each
other
to
a
degree
which
is
unknown
in
this
country
it
is
perhaps
not
very
commonly
understood
that
president
and
congress
alike
are
as
strictly
fettered
in
their
action
by
the
constitution
as
a
limited
liability
company
is
by
its
memorandum
of
association
this
constitution
which
defines
both
the
form
of
government
and
certain
liberties
of
the
subject
is
not
unalterable
but
it
can
be
altered
only
by
a
process
which
requires
both
the
consent
of
a
great
majority
in
congress
or
alternatively
of
a
great
majority
of
the
legislatures
of
the
distinct
states
composing
the
union
and
also
ratification
of
amendments
by
of
the
several
states
thus
we
shall
have
to
notice
later
that
a
constitutional
amendment
abolishing
slavery
became
a
terror
of
the
future
to
many
people
in
the
slave
states
but
remained
all
the
time
an
impossibility
in
the
view
of
most
people
in
the
free
states
we
have
above
all
things
to
dismiss
from
our
minds
any
idea
that
the
legislature
of
a
state
is
subordinate
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
that
a
state
governor
is
an
officer
under
the
president
the
constitution
of
the
union
was
the
product
of
a
sense
of
nationality
under
it
the
state
authority
in
the
american
sense
of
state
and
the
union
or
federal
authority
go
on
side
by
side
working
in
separate
spheres
each
subject
to
constitutional
restrictions
but
each
in
its
own
sphere
supreme
thus
the
state
authority
is
powerless
to
make
peace
or
war
or
to
impose
customs
duties
for
those
are
federal
matters
but
the
union
authority
is
equally
powerless
wherever
a
state
authority
has
been
constituted
to
punish
ordinary
crime
to
promote
education
or
to
regulate
factories
in
particular
by
the
constitution
as
it
stood
till
after
the
civil
war
the
union
authority
was
able
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
slaves
from
abroad
after
the
end
of
but
had
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
itself
in
any
of
the
states
further
congress
had
to
be
constituted
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
agreeable
to
the
smaller
states
which
did
not
wish
to
enter
into
a
union
in
which
their
influence
would
be
swamped
by
their
more
populous
neighbours
their
interest
was
secured
by
providing
that
in
the
senate
each
state
should
have
two
members
and
no
more
while
in
the
house
of
representatives
the
people
of
the
whole
union
are
represented
according
to
population
thus
legislation
through
congress
requires
the
concurrence
of
two
forces
which
may
easily
be
opposed
that
of
the
majority
of
american
citizens
and
that
of
the
majority
of
the
several
states
of
the
two
chambers
the
senate
whose
members
are
elected
for
six
years
and
to
secure
continuity
do
not
all
retire
at
the
same
time
became
as
time
went
on
though
not
at
first
attractive
to
statesmen
of
position
and
acquired
therefore
additional
influence
lastly
the
union
was
and
is
still
the
possessor
of
territories
not
included
in
any
state
and
in
the
territories
whatever
subordinate
they
might
be
allowed
the
federal
authority
has
always
been
supreme
and
uncontrolled
in
all
matters
but
as
these
territories
have
become
more
settled
and
more
populated
portions
of
them
have
steadily
from
the
first
been
organised
as
states
and
admitted
to
the
union
it
is
for
congress
to
settle
the
time
of
their
admission
and
to
make
any
conditions
in
regard
to
their
constitutions
as
states
but
when
once
admitted
as
states
they
have
thenceforward
the
full
rights
of
the
original
states
within
all
the
territories
while
they
remained
under
its
jurisdiction
it
lay
with
congress
to
determine
whether
slavery
should
be
lawful
or
not
and
when
any
portion
of
them
was
ripe
for
admission
to
the
union
as
a
state
congress
could
insist
that
the
new
constitution
should
or
should
not
prohibit
slavery
when
the
constitution
of
the
union
was
being
settled
slavery
was
the
subject
of
most
careful
compromise
but
in
any
union
formed
between
slave
states
and
free
a
bitter
root
of
controversy
must
have
remained
and
the
opening
through
which
controversy
actually
returned
was
provided
by
the
territories
on
all
other
matters
the
makers
of
the
constitution
had
in
the
highest
temper
of
statesmanship
found
a
way
round
seemingly
insuperable
difficulties
the
whole
attitude
of
the
fathers
towards
slavery
is
a
question
of
some
consequence
to
a
biographer
of
lincoln
and
we
shall
return
to
it
in
a
little
while
a
machine
of
government
had
been
created
and
we
are
shortly
to
consider
how
it
was
got
to
work
but
the
large
dominion
to
be
governed
had
to
be
settled
and
its
area
was
about
to
undergo
an
enormous
expansion
it
will
be
convenient
at
this
point
to
mark
the
stages
of
this
development
the
thirteen
colonies
had
when
they
first
revolted
definite
western
boundaries
the
westernmost
of
them
reaching
back
from
the
to
a
frontier
in
the
alleghany
mountains
but
at
the
close
of
the
war
great
britain
ceded
to
the
united
states
the
whole
of
the
inland
country
up
to
the
mississippi
river
virginia
had
in
the
meantime
effectively
colonised
kentucky
to
the
west
of
her
and
for
a
time
this
was
treated
as
within
her
borders
in
a
similar
way
tennessee
had
been
settled
from
north
and
south
carolina
and
was
treated
as
part
of
the
former
virginia
had
also
established
claims
by
conquest
north
of
the
ohio
river
in
what
was
called
the
territory
but
these
claims
and
all
similar
claims
of
particular
states
in
unsettled
or
territory
were
shortly
before
or
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
ceded
to
the
union
government
but
the
dominions
of
that
government
soon
received
a
vast
accession
in
by
a
brave
exercise
of
the
constitutional
powers
which
he
was
otherwise
disposed
to
restrict
jealously
president
jefferson
bought
from
napoleon
the
great
expanse
of
country
west
of
the
mississippi
called
louisiana
this
region
in
the
extreme
south
was
no
wider
than
the
present
state
of
louisiana
but
further
north
it
widened
out
so
as
to
take
in
the
whole
watershed
of
the
missouri
and
its
tributaries
including
in
the
extreme
north
nearly
all
the
present
state
of
montana
in
florida
was
purchased
from
spain
and
that
country
at
the
same
time
abandoned
its
claims
to
a
strip
of
coastland
which
now
forms
the
of
alabama
and
mississippi
such
was
the
extent
of
the
united
states
when
lincoln
began
his
political
life
in
the
movement
of
population
by
which
this
domain
was
being
settled
up
different
streams
may
be
roughly
distinguished
first
there
was
from
onwards
a
constant
movement
of
the
poorer
class
and
of
younger
sons
of
rich
men
from
the
great
state
of
virginia
and
to
some
extent
from
the
carolinas
into
kentucky
and
tennessee
whence
they
often
shifted
further
north
into
indiana
and
illinois
or
sometimes
further
west
into
missouri
it
was
mainly
a
movement
of
single
families
or
groups
of
families
of
adventurous
pioneers
very
sturdy
and
very
turbulent
then
there
came
the
expansion
of
the
great
plantation
interest
in
the
further
south
carrying
with
it
as
it
spread
not
occasional
slaves
as
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
but
the
whole
plantation
system
this
movement
went
not
only
directly
westward
but
still
more
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
up
the
mississippi
into
the
state
of
louisiana
where
a
considerable
french
population
had
settled
the
state
of
mississippi
and
later
into
missouri
later
still
came
the
westward
movement
from
the
northern
states
the
energies
of
the
people
in
these
states
had
at
first
been
to
great
extent
absorbed
by
pursuits
and
the
subjugation
of
their
own
rugged
soil
so
that
they
reached
western
regions
like
illinois
rather
later
than
did
the
settlers
from
states
further
south
ultimately
as
their
manufactures
grew
immigration
from
europe
began
its
steady
flow
to
these
states
and
the
great
westward
stream
which
continuing
in
our
days
has
filled
up
the
rich
lands
of
the
far
grew
in
volume
but
want
of
natural
timber
and
other
causes
hindered
the
development
of
the
fertile
prairie
soil
in
the
regions
beyond
the
upper
mississippi
till
the
period
of
railway
development
which
began
about
was
far
advanced
illinois
was
far
west
in
iowa
and
minnesota
continued
to
be
so
in
the
northerners
when
they
began
to
move
westward
came
in
comparatively
large
numbers
bringing
comparatively
ordered
habits
and
the
full
machinery
of
outward
civilisation
with
them
thus
a
great
social
change
followed
upon
their
arrival
in
the
regions
to
which
only
scattered
pioneers
such
as
the
lincolns
had
previously
penetrated
in
illinois
with
which
so
much
of
our
story
is
bound
up
the
rapidity
of
that
change
may
be
estimated
from
the
fact
that
the
population
of
that
state
multiplied
sevenfold
between
the
time
when
lincoln
settled
there
and
the
day
when
he
left
it
as
president
the
concluding
stages
by
which
the
dominions
of
the
united
states
came
to
be
as
we
know
them
were
the
annexation
by
agreement
in
of
the
republic
of
texas
which
had
separated
itself
from
mexico
and
which
claimed
besides
the
great
state
of
texas
a
considerable
territory
reaching
to
the
upper
portions
of
the
arkansas
river
the
apportionment
to
the
union
by
a
delimitation
treaty
with
great
britain
in
of
the
oregon
territory
including
roughly
the
state
of
that
name
and
the
rest
of
the
basin
of
the
columbia
river
up
to
the
present
frontier
british
columbia
being
at
the
same
time
apportioned
to
great
britain
the
conquest
from
mexico
in
of
california
and
a
vast
mountainous
tract
at
the
back
of
it
the
purchase
from
mexico
of
a
small
frontier
strip
in
and
the
acquisition
at
several
later
times
of
various
outlying
dependencies
which
will
in
no
way
concern
us
growth
of
the
practice
and
traditions
of
the
union
we
must
turn
back
to
the
internal
growth
of
the
new
united
nation
when
the
constitution
had
been
formed
and
the
question
of
its
acceptance
by
the
states
had
been
at
last
settled
and
when
washington
had
been
inaugurated
as
the
first
president
under
it
a
wholly
new
conflict
arose
between
two
parties
led
by
two
ministers
in
the
president
cabinet
alexander
hamilton
and
thomas
jefferson
both
were
potent
and
remarkable
men
hamilton
in
all
senses
a
great
man
these
two
men
for
all
their
antagonism
did
services
to
their
country
without
which
the
vigorous
growth
of
the
new
nation
would
not
have
been
possible
the
figure
of
alexander
hamilton
then
secretary
of
the
treasury
ranked
by
talleyrand
with
fox
and
napoleon
as
one
of
the
three
great
men
he
had
known
must
fascinate
any
english
student
of
the
period
if
his
name
is
not
celebrated
in
the
same
way
in
the
country
which
he
so
eminently
served
it
is
perhaps
because
in
his
ideas
as
in
his
origin
he
was
not
strictly
american
as
a
boy
half
scotch
half
french
huguenot
from
the
english
west
indian
island
of
nevis
he
had
been
at
school
in
new
york
when
his
speeches
had
some
real
effect
in
attaching
that
city
to
the
cause
of
independence
he
had
served
brilliantly
in
the
war
on
washington
staff
and
with
his
regiment
he
had
chivalrously
defended
as
an
advocate
and
in
other
ways
the
englishmen
and
loyalists
against
whose
cause
he
fought
he
had
induced
the
great
central
state
of
new
york
to
accept
the
constitution
when
the
strongest
local
party
would
have
rejected
it
and
made
the
union
impossible
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
he
organised
the
machinery
of
government
helped
his
chief
to
preserve
a
strong
upright
and
cautious
foreign
policy
at
the
critical
point
of
the
young
republic
infancy
and
performed
perhaps
the
greatest
and
most
difficult
service
of
all
in
setting
the
disordered
finances
of
the
country
upon
a
sound
footing
in
early
middle
age
he
ended
a
life
not
flawless
but
admirable
and
lovable
in
a
duel
murderously
forced
upon
him
by
one
aaron
burr
this
man
who
was
an
elegant
profligate
with
many
graces
but
no
public
principle
was
a
claimant
to
the
presidency
in
opposition
to
hamilton
greatest
opponent
jefferson
hamilton
knowingly
incurred
a
feud
which
must
at
the
best
have
been
dangerous
to
him
by
unhesitatingly
throwing
his
weight
upon
the
side
of
jefferson
his
own
ungenerous
rival
the
details
of
his
policy
do
not
concern
us
but
the
united
states
could
hardly
have
endured
for
many
years
without
the
passionate
sense
of
the
need
of
government
and
the
genius
for
actual
administration
with
which
hamilton
set
the
new
nation
on
its
way
nevertheless
so
do
gifts
differ
the
general
spirit
which
has
on
the
whole
informed
the
american
nation
and
held
it
together
was
neither
respected
nor
understood
by
him
his
party
called
the
federalists
because
they
claimed
to
stand
for
a
strong
and
an
efficient
federal
government
did
not
survive
him
long
it
is
of
interest
to
us
here
only
because
with
its
early
disappearance
there
ceased
for
ever
to
be
in
america
any
party
whatsoever
which
in
any
sense
represented
aristocratic
principles
or
leanings
the
fate
of
jefferson
party
at
first
called
republican
but
by
no
means
to
be
confused
with
the
republican
party
which
will
concern
us
later
was
far
different
for
the
democratic
party
represented
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
at
this
moment
claims
to
descend
from
it
in
unbroken
apostolic
succession
but
we
need
not
pause
to
trace
the
connecting
thread
between
them
real
as
it
is
for
parties
are
not
to
be
regarded
as
individuals
indeed
the
personality
of
thomas
jefferson
secretary
of
state
in
washington
cabinet
impressed
itself
during
his
life
and
long
after
upon
all
america
more
than
that
of
any
other
man
democrats
have
described
lincoln
who
by
no
means
belonged
to
their
party
as
jefferson
spiritual
heir
and
lincoln
would
have
welcomed
the
description
no
biographer
has
achieved
an
understanding
presentment
of
curious
character
which
as
presented
by
unfriendly
critics
is
an
unpleasing
combination
of
contrasting
elements
a
tall
and
active
fellow
a
good
horseman
and
a
good
shot
living
through
seven
years
of
civil
war
which
he
had
himself
heralded
in
without
the
inclination
to
strike
a
blow
a
scholar
musician
and
mathematician
without
delicacy
elevation
or
precision
of
thought
or
language
a
man
of
intense
ambition
without
either
administrative
capacity
or
the
courage
to
assert
himself
in
counsel
or
in
debate
a
dealer
in
philanthropic
sentiment
privately
malignant
and
vindictive
this
is
not
as
a
whole
a
credible
portrait
it
can
not
stand
for
the
man
as
his
friends
knew
him
but
there
is
evidence
for
each
feature
of
it
and
it
remains
impossible
for
a
foreigner
to
think
of
jefferson
and
not
compare
him
to
his
disadvantage
with
the
antagonist
whom
he
eclipsed
by
pertinacious
industry
however
working
chiefly
through
private
correspondence
he
constructed
a
great
party
dominated
a
nation
and
dominated
it
mainly
for
good
for
the
rapid
and
complete
triumph
of
jefferson
party
over
its
opponents
signifies
a
very
definite
and
lasting
conversion
of
the
main
stream
of
american
public
opinion
to
what
may
be
called
the
sane
element
in
the
principles
of
the
french
revolution
at
the
time
when
he
set
himself
to
counterwork
hamilton
american
statesmanship
was
likely
to
be
directed
only
to
making
government
strong
and
to
ensuring
the
stability
of
the
business
world
for
reaction
against
the
bloody
absurdities
that
had
happened
in
france
was
strong
in
america
and
in
english
thought
which
still
had
influence
in
america
it
was
against
this
he
asserted
an
intense
belief
in
the
value
of
freedom
in
the
equal
claim
of
men
of
all
conditions
to
the
consideration
of
government
and
in
the
supreme
importance
to
government
of
the
consenting
mind
of
the
governed
and
he
made
this
sense
so
definitely
a
part
of
the
national
stock
of
ideas
that
while
the
principles
of
strong
and
sound
government
were
not
lost
to
sight
they
were
consciously
rated
as
subordinate
to
the
principles
of
liberty
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
ascendency
thus
early
acquired
by
what
may
be
called
liberal
opinions
in
america
was
a
matter
merely
of
setting
some
fine
phrases
in
circulation
or
of
adopting
as
was
early
done
in
most
states
a
wide
franchise
and
other
external
marks
of
democracy
we
may
dwell
a
little
longer
on
the
unusual
but
curiously
popular
figure
of
jefferson
for
it
illustrates
the
spirit
with
which
the
commonwealth
became
imbued
under
his
leadership
he
has
sometimes
been
presented
as
a
man
of
flabby
character
whose
historical
part
was
that
of
intermediary
between
impracticable
french
philosophes
and
the
ruffians
and
swindlers
that
martin
chuzzlewit
encountered
who
were
all
children
of
liberty
and
whose
boastful
answer
to
the
despot
and
the
tyrant
was
that
their
bright
home
was
in
the
settin
sun
he
was
nothing
of
the
kind
his
judgment
was
probably
unsound
on
the
questions
of
foreign
policy
on
which
as
secretary
of
state
he
differed
from
washington
and
he
leaned
no
doubt
to
a
jealous
and
too
narrow
insistence
upon
the
limits
set
by
the
constitution
to
the
government
power
but
he
and
his
party
were
emphatically
right
in
the
resistance
which
they
offered
to
certain
needless
measures
of
coercion
as
president
though
he
was
not
a
great
president
he
suffered
the
sensible
course
of
administration
originated
by
his
opponent
to
continue
undisturbed
and
america
owed
to
one
bold
and
act
of
his
the
greatest
of
the
steps
by
which
her
territory
was
enlarged
it
is
however
in
the
field
of
domestic
policy
which
rested
with
the
states
and
with
which
a
president
has
often
little
to
do
that
the
results
of
his
principles
must
be
sought
jefferson
was
a
man
who
had
worked
unwearyingly
in
virginia
at
sound
and
what
we
should
now
call
conservative
reforms
establishing
religious
toleration
reforming
a
preposterous
land
law
seeking
to
provide
education
for
the
poor
striving
unsuccessfully
for
a
sensible
scheme
of
gradual
emancipation
of
the
slaves
in
like
manner
his
disciples
after
him
in
their
several
states
devoted
themselves
to
the
kind
of
work
in
removing
manifest
abuses
and
providing
for
manifest
new
social
needs
in
which
english
reformers
like
romilly
and
bentham
and
the
leaders
of
the
first
reformed
parliament
were
to
be
successful
somewhat
later
the
americans
who
so
exasperated
dickens
vainly
supposed
themselves
to
be
far
ahead
of
england
in
much
that
we
now
consider
essential
to
a
nation
but
there
could
have
been
no
answer
to
americans
of
jefferson
generation
if
they
had
made
the
same
claim
it
is
with
this
fact
in
mind
that
we
should
approach
the
famous
words
of
jefferson
which
echoed
so
long
with
triumphant
or
reproachful
sound
in
the
ears
of
americans
and
to
which
long
after
lincoln
was
to
make
a
memorable
appeal
the
propaganda
which
he
carried
on
when
the
constitution
had
been
adopted
was
on
behalf
of
a
principle
which
he
had
enunciated
as
a
younger
man
when
he
drafted
the
declaration
of
independence
that
document
is
mainly
a
rehearsal
of
the
grievances
and
is
as
strictly
lawyerlike
and
about
as
fair
or
unfair
as
the
arguments
of
a
parliamentarian
under
charles
i
but
the
argumentation
is
prefaced
with
these
sounding
words
we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
that
to
secure
these
rights
governments
are
instituted
among
men
deriving
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
few
propositions
outside
the
bible
have
offered
so
easy
a
mark
to
the
shafts
of
unintelligently
clever
criticism
jefferson
when
he
said
that
all
men
are
created
equal
and
the
tory
johnson
when
he
spoke
of
the
natural
equality
of
man
used
a
curious
eighteenth
century
phrase
of
which
a
greek
scholar
can
see
the
origin
but
it
did
not
mean
anything
absurd
nor
on
the
other
hand
did
it
convey
a
mere
platitude
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
explain
as
lincoln
did
long
after
that
jefferson
did
not
suppose
all
men
to
be
of
equal
height
or
weight
or
equally
wise
or
equally
good
he
did
however
contend
for
a
principle
of
which
one
elementary
application
is
the
law
which
makes
murder
the
same
crime
whatever
be
the
relative
positions
of
the
murderer
and
the
murdered
man
such
a
law
was
indeed
firmly
rooted
in
england
before
jefferson
talked
of
equality
but
it
amazed
the
rest
of
europe
when
the
house
of
lords
hanged
a
peer
for
the
murder
of
his
servant
there
are
indefinitely
many
further
ways
in
which
men
who
are
utterly
unequal
had
best
be
treated
as
creatures
equally
entitled
to
the
consideration
of
government
and
of
their
neighbours
it
is
safer
to
carry
this
principle
too
far
than
not
to
carry
it
far
enough
if
jefferson
had
expressed
this
and
his
cognate
principle
of
liberty
with
scientific
precision
or
with
the
full
personal
sincerity
with
which
a
greater
man
like
lincoln
expressed
it
he
would
have
said
little
from
which
any
englishman
would
dissent
none
the
less
he
would
have
enunciated
a
doctrine
which
most
governments
then
existing
set
at
naught
or
proscribed
and
for
which
hamilton
and
the
prosperous
champions
of
independence
who
supported
him
had
no
use
the
declaration
of
independence
was
not
a
very
candid
state
paper
and
the
popularity
jefferson
afterwards
created
for
its
sentiments
was
not
wholly
free
from
humbug
many
men
were
more
ready
to
think
themselves
the
equals
of
washington
or
hamilton
in
the
respects
in
which
they
were
not
so
than
to
think
a
negro
their
own
equal
in
the
respects
in
which
he
was
the
boundless
space
and
untrammelled
conditions
of
the
new
world
made
liberty
and
equality
in
some
directions
highly
attainable
ideals
so
much
so
that
they
seemed
to
demand
little
effort
or
discipline
the
patriotic
orators
under
whom
lincoln
sat
in
his
youth
would
ascribe
to
the
political
wisdom
of
their
great
democracy
what
was
really
the
result
of
geography
they
would
regard
the
extent
of
forest
and
prairie
as
creditable
to
themselves
just
as
some
few
englishmen
have
regarded
our
location
upon
an
island
this
does
not
however
do
away
with
the
value
of
that
tradition
of
the
new
world
which
in
its
purest
and
sincerest
form
became
part
and
parcel
of
lincoln
mind
jefferson
was
a
great
american
patriot
in
his
case
insistence
on
the
rights
of
the
several
states
sprang
from
no
desire
for
a
great
american
nation
he
regarded
these
provincial
organisations
as
machinery
by
which
government
and
the
people
could
be
brought
nearer
together
and
he
contributed
that
which
was
most
needed
for
the
evolution
of
a
vigorous
national
life
he
imparted
to
the
very
recent
historical
origin
of
his
country
and
his
followers
imparted
to
its
material
conditions
a
certain
element
of
poetry
and
the
felt
presence
of
a
wholesome
national
ideal
the
patriotism
of
an
older
country
derives
its
glory
and
its
pride
from
influences
deep
rooted
in
the
past
creating
a
tradition
of
public
and
private
action
which
needs
no
definite
formula
the
man
who
did
more
than
any
other
to
supply
this
lack
in
a
new
country
by
imbuing
its
national
consciousness
even
its
national
cant
with
high
aspiration
did
it
may
well
be
more
than
any
strong
administrator
or
constructive
statesman
to
create
a
union
which
should
thereafter
seem
worth
preserving
missouri
no
sober
critic
applying
to
the
american
statesmen
of
the
first
generation
the
standards
which
he
would
apply
to
their
english
contemporaries
can
blame
them
in
the
least
because
they
framed
their
constitution
as
best
they
could
and
were
not
deterred
by
the
scruples
which
they
felt
about
slavery
from
effecting
a
union
between
states
which
on
all
other
grounds
except
their
latent
difference
upon
slavery
seemed
meant
to
be
one
but
many
of
these
men
had
set
their
hands
in
the
declaration
of
independence
to
the
most
unqualified
claim
of
liberty
and
equality
for
all
men
and
proceeded
in
the
constitution
to
give
nineteen
years
grace
to
that
most
detestable
sum
of
all
villainies
as
wesley
called
it
the
african
slave
trade
and
to
impose
on
the
states
which
thought
slavery
wrong
the
dirty
work
of
restoring
escaped
slaves
to
captivity
why
johnson
had
asked
do
the
loudest
yelps
for
liberty
come
from
the
drivers
of
slaves
we
are
forced
to
recognise
upon
any
study
of
the
facts
that
they
could
not
really
have
made
the
union
otherwise
than
as
they
did
yet
a
doubt
presents
itself
as
to
the
general
soundness
and
sincerity
of
their
boasted
notions
of
liberty
now
later
on
we
shall
have
to
understand
the
policy
as
to
slavery
on
behalf
of
which
lincoln
stepped
forward
as
a
leader
in
his
own
constantly
reiterated
words
it
was
a
return
to
the
position
of
the
fathers
and
though
he
was
not
a
professional
historian
it
concerns
us
to
know
that
there
was
sincerity
at
least
in
his
intensely
historical
view
of
politics
we
have
then
to
see
first
how
the
fathers
that
is
the
most
considerable
men
among
those
who
won
independence
and
made
the
constitution
set
out
with
a
very
honest
view
on
the
subject
of
slavery
but
with
a
too
comfortable
hope
of
its
approaching
end
which
one
or
two
lived
to
see
frustrated
secondly
how
the
men
who
succeeded
them
were
led
to
abandon
such
hopes
and
content
themselves
with
a
compromise
as
to
slavery
which
they
trusted
would
at
least
keep
the
american
nation
in
being
among
those
who
signed
the
declaration
of
independence
there
were
presumably
some
of
johnson
yelpers
it
mattered
more
that
there
were
sturdy
people
who
had
no
idea
of
giving
up
slavery
and
probably
did
not
relish
having
to
join
in
protestations
about
equality
men
like
jefferson
ought
to
have
known
well
that
their
associates
in
south
carolina
and
georgia
in
particular
did
not
share
their
aspirations
the
people
of
georgia
indeed
were
recent
and
ardent
converts
to
the
slave
system
but
these
sincere
and
insincere
believers
in
slavery
were
the
exceptions
their
views
did
not
then
seem
to
prevail
even
in
the
greatest
of
the
slave
states
virginia
broadly
speaking
the
american
opinion
on
this
matter
in
or
in
had
gone
as
far
ahead
of
english
opinion
as
english
opinion
had
in
turn
gone
ahead
of
american
when
in
the
year
after
the
first
reform
bill
the
english
people
put
its
hand
into
its
pocket
and
bought
out
its
own
slave
owners
in
the
west
indies
the
british
government
had
forced
several
of
the
american
colonies
to
permit
slavery
against
their
will
and
only
in
it
had
vetoed
in
the
interest
of
british
trade
a
colonial
enactment
for
suppressing
the
slave
trade
this
was
sincerely
felt
as
a
part
though
a
minor
part
of
the
grievance
against
the
mother
country
so
far
did
such
views
prevail
on
the
surface
that
a
convention
of
all
the
colonies
in
unanimously
voted
that
the
abolition
of
domestic
slavery
is
the
greatest
object
of
desire
in
those
colonies
where
it
was
unhappily
introduced
in
their
infant
state
but
previous
to
the
enfranchisement
of
the
slaves
in
law
it
is
necessary
to
exclude
all
further
importation
from
africa
it
was
therefore
very
commonly
assumed
when
after
an
interval
of
war
which
suspended
such
reforms
independence
was
achieved
that
slavery
was
a
doomed
institution
those
among
the
fathers
whose
names
are
best
known
in
england
washington
john
adams
jefferson
madison
franklin
and
hamilton
were
all
opponents
of
slavery
these
include
the
first
four
presidents
and
the
leaders
of
very
different
schools
of
thought
some
of
them
washington
and
jefferson
at
least
had
a
few
slaves
of
their
own
washington
attitude
to
his
slaves
is
illustrated
by
a
letter
which
he
wrote
to
secure
the
return
of
a
black
attendant
of
washington
who
had
run
away
a
thing
which
he
had
boasted
could
never
occur
in
his
household
the
runaway
was
to
be
brought
back
if
she
could
be
persuaded
to
return
her
master
legal
power
to
compel
her
was
not
to
be
used
she
was
in
fact
free
but
had
foolishly
left
a
good
place
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
otherwise
with
jefferson
slaves
jefferson
theory
was
vehemently
against
slavery
in
old
age
he
gave
up
hope
in
the
matter
and
was
more
solicitous
for
union
than
for
liberty
but
this
was
after
the
disappointment
of
many
efforts
in
these
efforts
he
had
no
illusory
notion
of
equality
he
wrote
in
when
he
had
been
defeated
in
the
attempt
to
carry
a
measure
of
gradual
emancipation
in
virginia
nobody
wishes
more
than
i
do
to
see
such
proofs
as
you
exhibit
that
nature
has
given
to
our
black
brothers
talents
equal
to
those
of
the
other
colours
of
men
and
that
the
appearance
of
a
want
of
them
is
owing
mainly
to
the
degraded
condition
of
their
existence
both
in
africa
and
america
i
can
add
with
truth
that
nobody
wishes
more
ardently
to
see
a
good
system
commenced
for
raising
the
condition
both
of
their
body
and
mind
to
what
it
ought
to
be
as
fast
as
the
imbecility
of
their
present
existence
and
other
circumstances
which
can
not
be
neglected
will
permit
when
he
felt
at
last
that
freedom
was
not
making
way
his
letters
by
which
his
influence
was
chiefly
exercised
abounded
in
passionate
regrets
i
tremble
for
my
country
he
wrote
when
i
think
of
the
negro
and
remember
that
god
is
just
but
if
he
is
judged
not
by
his
sentiments
or
even
by
his
efforts
but
by
what
he
accomplished
this
rhetorical
champion
of
freedom
did
accomplish
one
great
act
the
first
link
as
it
proved
in
the
chain
of
events
by
which
slavery
was
ultimately
abolished
in
the
territory
as
it
was
called
was
ceded
by
virginia
to
the
old
congress
of
the
days
before
the
union
jefferson
then
endeavoured
to
pass
an
ordinance
by
which
slavery
should
be
excluded
from
all
territory
that
might
ever
belong
to
congress
in
this
indeed
he
failed
for
in
part
of
the
territory
likely
to
be
acquired
slavery
was
already
established
but
the
result
was
a
famous
ordinance
of
by
which
slavery
was
for
ever
excluded
from
the
soil
of
the
territory
itself
and
thus
when
they
came
into
being
the
states
of
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin
found
themselves
congenitally
incapable
of
becoming
slave
states
the
further
achievements
of
that
generation
in
this
matter
were
considerable
it
must
of
course
be
understood
that
the
holding
of
slaves
and
the
slave
trade
from
africa
were
regarded
as
two
distinct
questions
the
new
congress
abolished
the
slave
trade
on
the
first
day
on
which
the
constitution
allowed
it
to
do
so
that
is
on
january
the
mother
country
abolished
it
just
about
the
same
time
but
already
all
but
three
of
the
states
had
for
themselves
abolished
the
slave
trade
in
their
own
borders
as
to
slavery
itself
seven
of
the
original
thirteen
states
and
vermont
the
first
of
the
added
states
had
abolished
that
before
these
indeed
were
northern
states
where
slavery
was
not
of
importance
but
in
virginia
there
was
or
had
been
till
lately
a
growing
opinion
that
slavery
was
not
economical
and
with
the
ignorance
common
in
one
part
of
a
country
of
the
true
conditions
in
another
part
it
was
natural
to
look
upon
emancipation
as
a
policy
which
would
spread
of
itself
at
any
rate
it
is
certain
fact
that
the
chief
among
the
men
who
had
made
the
constitution
had
at
that
time
so
regarded
it
and
continued
to
do
so
under
this
belief
and
in
the
presence
of
many
pressing
subjects
of
interest
the
early
movement
for
emancipation
in
america
died
down
with
its
work
half
finished
but
before
this
happy
belief
expired
an
economic
event
had
happened
which
riveted
slavery
upon
the
south
in
eli
whitney
a
yale
student
upon
a
holiday
in
the
south
invented
the
first
machine
for
cleaning
cotton
of
its
seeds
the
export
of
cotton
jumped
from
lbs
in
to
lbs
in
slave
labour
had
been
found
or
was
believed
to
be
especially
economical
in
cotton
growing
slavery
therefore
rapidly
became
the
mainstay
of
wealth
and
of
the
social
system
in
south
carolina
and
throughout
the
far
south
and
in
a
little
while
the
baser
sort
of
planters
in
virginia
discovered
that
breeding
slaves
to
sell
down
south
was
a
very
profitable
form
of
we
may
pass
to
the
year
when
an
enactment
was
passed
by
congress
which
for
years
thereafter
might
be
regarded
as
hardly
less
fundamental
than
the
constitution
itself
up
till
then
nine
new
states
had
been
added
to
the
original
thirteen
it
was
repugnant
to
principles
still
strong
in
the
north
that
these
states
should
be
admitted
to
the
union
with
state
constitutions
which
permitted
slavery
on
the
other
hand
it
was
for
two
reasons
important
to
the
chief
slave
states
that
they
should
be
they
would
otherwise
be
closed
to
southern
planters
who
wished
to
migrate
to
unexhausted
soil
carrying
with
them
the
methods
of
industry
and
the
ways
of
life
which
they
understood
furthermore
the
north
was
bound
to
have
before
long
a
great
preponderance
of
population
and
if
this
were
not
neutralised
by
keeping
the
number
of
states
on
one
side
and
the
other
equal
there
would
be
a
future
political
danger
to
slavery
up
to
a
certain
point
the
north
could
with
good
conscience
yield
to
the
south
in
this
matter
for
the
soil
of
four
of
the
new
slave
states
had
been
ceded
to
the
union
by
old
slave
states
and
had
settled
freely
upon
it
and
in
a
fifth
louisiana
slavery
had
been
safeguarded
by
the
express
stipulations
of
the
treaty
with
france
which
applied
to
that
portion
though
no
other
of
the
territory
then
ceded
naturally
then
it
had
happened
though
without
any
definite
agreement
that
for
years
past
slave
states
and
free
states
had
been
admitted
to
the
union
in
pairs
now
arose
the
question
of
a
further
portion
of
the
old
french
territory
the
present
state
of
missouri
a
few
with
their
slaves
had
in
fact
settled
there
but
no
distinct
claims
on
behalf
of
slavery
could
be
alleged
the
northern
senators
and
members
of
congress
demanded
therefore
that
the
constitution
of
missouri
should
provide
for
the
gradual
extinction
of
slavery
there
naturally
there
arose
a
controversy
which
sounded
to
the
aged
jefferson
like
a
in
the
night
and
revealed
for
the
first
time
to
all
america
a
deep
rift
in
the
union
the
representatives
of
the
south
eventually
carried
their
main
point
with
the
votes
of
several
northern
men
known
to
history
as
the
who
all
lost
their
seats
at
the
next
election
missouri
was
admitted
as
a
slave
state
maine
about
the
same
time
as
a
free
state
and
it
was
enacted
that
thereafter
in
the
remainder
of
the
territory
that
had
been
bought
from
france
slavery
should
be
unlawful
north
of
latitude
degrees
minutes
while
by
tacit
agreement
permitted
south
of
it
this
was
the
missouri
compromise
the
north
regarded
it
at
first
as
a
humiliation
but
learnt
to
point
to
it
later
as
a
sort
of
magna
carta
for
the
northern
territories
the
adoption
of
it
marks
a
point
from
which
it
became
for
years
the
express
ambition
of
the
principal
american
statesmen
and
the
tacit
object
of
every
party
manager
to
keep
the
slavery
question
from
ever
becoming
again
a
burning
issue
in
politics
the
collapse
of
it
in
was
to
prove
the
decisive
event
in
the
career
of
abraham
lincoln
aged
when
it
was
passed
parties
and
tendencies
in
lincoln
just
about
the
year
when
lincoln
started
life
in
illinois
several
distinct
movements
in
national
life
began
or
culminated
they
link
themselves
with
several
famous
names
the
two
leaders
to
whom
as
a
young
politician
lincoln
owed
some
sort
of
allegiance
were
webster
and
clay
and
they
continued
throughout
his
long
political
apprenticeship
to
be
recognised
in
most
of
america
as
the
great
men
of
their
time
daniel
webster
must
have
been
nearly
a
great
man
he
was
always
passed
over
for
the
presidency
that
was
not
so
much
because
of
the
private
failings
which
marked
his
robust
and
generous
character
as
because
in
days
of
artificial
party
issues
when
vital
questions
are
dealt
with
by
mere
compromise
high
office
seems
to
belong
of
right
to
men
of
less
originality
if
he
was
never
quite
so
great
as
all
america
took
him
to
be
it
was
not
for
want
of
brains
or
of
honesty
but
because
his
consuming
passion
for
the
union
at
all
costs
led
him
into
the
path
of
least
apparent
risk
to
it
twice
as
secretary
of
state
that
is
chiefly
foreign
minister
he
showed
himself
a
statesman
but
above
all
he
was
an
orator
and
one
of
those
rare
orators
who
accomplish
a
definite
task
by
their
oratory
in
his
style
he
carried
on
the
tradition
of
english
parliamentary
speaking
and
developed
its
vices
yet
further
but
the
massive
force
of
argument
behind
gave
him
his
real
power
that
power
he
devoted
to
the
education
of
the
people
in
a
feeling
for
the
nation
and
for
its
greatness
as
an
advocate
he
had
appeared
in
great
cases
in
the
supreme
court
john
marshall
the
chief
justice
from
to
brought
a
great
legal
mind
of
the
higher
type
to
the
settlement
of
doubtful
points
in
the
constitution
and
his
statesmanlike
judgments
did
much
both
to
strengthen
the
united
states
government
and
to
gain
public
confidence
for
it
it
was
a
memorable
work
for
the
power
of
the
union
government
under
its
new
constitution
lay
in
the
grip
of
the
courts
the
pleading
of
the
young
webster
contributed
much
to
this
later
on
webster
and
a
school
of
followers
of
whom
perhaps
we
may
take
our
elijah
pogram
to
have
been
one
used
ceremonial
occasions
on
which
englishmen
only
suffer
the
speakers
for
the
purpose
of
inculcating
their
patriotic
doctrine
and
webster
at
least
was
doing
good
his
greatest
speech
upon
an
occasion
to
which
we
shall
shortly
come
was
itself
an
event
lincoln
found
in
it
as
inspiring
a
political
treatise
as
many
englishmen
have
discovered
in
the
speeches
and
writings
of
burke
henry
clay
was
a
slighter
but
more
attractive
person
he
was
apparently
the
first
american
public
man
whom
his
countrymen
styled
magnetic
but
a
sort
of
scheming
instability
caused
him
after
one
or
two
trials
to
be
set
down
as
an
impossible
candidate
for
the
presidency
as
a
dashing
young
man
from
the
west
he
had
the
chief
hand
in
forcing
on
the
second
war
with
great
britain
from
to
which
arose
out
of
perhaps
insufficient
causes
and
ended
in
no
clear
result
but
which
it
is
probable
marked
a
stage
in
the
growth
of
loyalty
to
america
as
an
older
man
he
was
famed
as
an
architect
of
compromises
for
though
he
strove
for
emancipation
in
his
own
state
kentucky
and
dreamed
of
a
great
scheme
for
colonising
the
slaves
in
africa
he
was
supremely
anxious
to
avert
collision
between
north
and
south
and
in
this
respect
was
typical
of
his
generation
but
about
he
was
chiefly
known
as
the
apostle
of
what
was
called
the
american
policy
this
was
a
policy
which
aimed
at
using
the
powers
of
the
national
government
for
the
development
of
the
boundless
resources
of
the
country
its
methods
comprised
a
national
banking
system
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
union
on
great
public
works
and
a
protective
tariff
which
it
was
hoped
might
chiefly
operate
to
encourage
promising
but
infant
industries
and
to
tax
the
luxuries
of
the
rich
whatever
may
have
been
the
merits
of
this
policy
which
made
some
commotion
for
a
few
years
we
can
easily
understand
that
it
appealed
to
the
imagination
of
young
lincoln
at
a
time
of
keen
political
energy
on
his
part
of
which
we
have
but
meagre
details
a
third
celebrity
of
this
period
in
his
own
locality
a
still
more
powerful
man
was
john
caldwell
calhoun
of
south
carolina
he
enjoyed
beyond
all
his
contemporaries
the
fame
of
an
intellectual
person
lincoln
conceded
high
admiration
to
his
concise
and
penetrating
phrases
an
englishwoman
harriet
martineau
who
knew
him
has
described
him
as
embodied
intellect
he
had
undoubtedly
in
full
measure
those
negative
tides
to
respect
which
have
gone
far
in
america
to
ensure
praise
from
the
public
and
the
historians
for
he
was
correct
and
austere
and
which
is
more
kindly
among
his
family
and
his
slaves
he
is
credited
too
with
an
observance
of
high
principle
in
public
life
which
it
might
be
difficult
to
illustrate
from
his
recorded
actions
but
the
andrew
jackson
set
him
down
as
heartless
selfish
and
a
physical
coward
and
jackson
could
speak
generously
of
an
opponent
whom
he
really
knew
his
intellect
must
have
been
powerful
enough
but
it
was
that
of
a
man
who
delights
in
arguing
and
delights
in
elaborate
deductions
from
principles
which
he
is
too
proud
to
revise
a
man
too
who
is
fearless
in
accepting
conclusions
which
startle
or
repel
the
vulgar
mind
who
is
undisturbed
in
his
logical
processes
by
good
sense
healthy
sentiment
or
any
vigorous
appetite
for
truth
such
men
have
disciples
who
reap
the
disgrace
which
their
masters
are
apt
somehow
to
avoid
they
give
the
prestige
of
wisdom
and
high
thought
to
causes
which
could
not
otherwise
earn
them
a
northern
soldier
came
back
wounded
in
and
described
to
the
next
soldier
in
the
hospital
calhoun
monument
at
charleston
the
other
said
what
you
saw
is
not
the
real
monument
but
i
have
seen
it
it
is
the
desolated
ruined
south
that
is
calhoun
real
monument
this
man
was
a
radical
and
known
as
the
successor
of
jefferson
but
his
radicalism
showed
itself
in
drawing
inspiration
solely
from
the
popular
catchwords
of
his
own
locality
he
adored
the
union
but
it
was
to
be
a
union
directed
by
distinguished
politicians
from
the
south
in
a
sectional
southern
interest
he
did
not
originate
but
he
secured
the
strength
of
orthodoxy
and
fashion
to
a
tone
of
sentiment
and
opinion
which
for
a
generation
held
undisputed
supremacy
in
the
heart
of
the
south
americans
might
have
seemed
at
this
time
to
be
united
in
a
curiously
exultant
national
but
though
there
was
no
sharp
division
of
sections
the
boasted
glory
of
the
one
america
meant
to
many
planters
in
the
south
the
glory
of
their
own
settled
and
free
life
with
their
dignified
equals
round
them
and
their
often
contented
dependents
under
them
plain
men
among
them
doubtless
took
things
as
they
were
and
without
any
particular
wish
to
change
them
did
not
pretend
they
were
perfect
but
it
is
evident
that
in
a
widening
circle
of
clever
young
men
in
the
south
the
claim
of
some
peculiar
virtue
for
southern
institutions
became
habitual
in
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
their
way
of
life
was
beautiful
in
their
eyes
it
rested
upon
slavery
therefore
slavery
was
a
good
thing
it
was
wicked
even
to
criticise
it
and
it
was
weak
to
apologise
for
it
or
to
pretend
that
it
needed
reformation
it
was
easy
and
it
became
apparently
universal
for
the
different
churches
of
the
south
to
prostitute
the
word
of
god
in
this
cause
later
on
crude
notions
of
evolution
began
to
get
about
in
a
few
circles
of
advanced
thought
and
these
lent
themselves
as
easily
to
the
same
purpose
loose
floating
thoughts
of
this
kind
might
have
mattered
little
calhoun
as
the
recognised
wise
man
of
the
old
south
concentrated
them
and
fastened
them
upon
its
people
as
a
creed
glorification
of
our
institution
at
the
south
became
the
main
principle
of
southern
politicians
and
any
conception
that
there
may
ever
have
been
of
a
task
for
constructive
statesmanship
in
solving
the
negro
problem
passed
into
oblivion
under
the
influence
of
his
revered
reasoning
faculty
but
of
his
dark
and
dangerous
sort
calhoun
was
an
able
man
he
foresaw
early
that
the
best
weapon
of
the
common
interest
of
the
slave
states
lay
in
the
rights
which
might
be
claimed
for
each
individual
state
against
the
union
the
idea
that
a
discontented
state
might
secede
from
the
union
was
not
novel
it
had
been
mooted
in
new
england
during
the
last
war
against
great
britain
and
curiously
enough
among
the
rump
of
the
old
federalist
party
but
it
was
generally
discounted
calhoun
first
brought
it
into
prominence
veiled
in
an
elaborate
form
which
some
previous
south
carolinian
had
devised
the
occasion
had
nothing
to
do
with
slavery
it
concerned
free
trade
a
very
respectable
issue
but
so
clearly
a
minor
issue
that
to
break
up
a
great
country
upon
it
would
have
gone
beyond
the
limit
of
solemn
frivolity
and
calhoun
must
be
taken
to
have
been
forging
an
implement
with
which
his
own
section
of
the
states
could
claim
and
extort
concessions
from
the
union
a
protective
tariff
had
been
passed
in
the
southern
states
which
would
have
to
pay
the
protective
duties
but
did
not
profit
by
them
disliked
it
calhoun
and
others
took
the
intelligible
but
too
refined
point
that
the
powers
of
congress
under
the
constitution
authorised
a
tariff
for
revenue
but
not
a
tariff
for
a
protective
purpose
every
state
calhoun
declared
must
have
the
constitutional
right
to
protect
itself
against
an
act
of
congress
which
it
deemed
unconstitutional
let
such
a
state
in
special
convention
nullify
the
act
of
congress
let
congress
then
unless
it
compromised
the
matter
submit
its
act
to
the
people
in
the
form
of
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
it
would
then
require
a
majority
of
all
the
states
to
pass
the
obnoxious
act
last
but
not
least
if
the
act
was
passed
the
protesting
state
had
calhoun
claimed
the
right
to
secede
from
the
union
controversy
over
this
tariff
raged
for
fully
four
years
and
had
a
memorable
issue
in
the
course
of
the
doctrine
of
nullification
and
secession
was
discussed
in
the
senate
and
the
view
of
calhoun
was
expounded
by
one
senator
hayne
webster
answered
him
in
a
speech
which
he
meant
should
become
a
popular
classic
and
which
did
become
so
he
set
forth
his
own
doctrine
of
the
union
and
appealed
to
national
against
state
loyalty
in
the
most
influential
oration
that
was
perhaps
ever
made
his
utterance
writes
president
wilson
sent
a
thrill
through
all
the
east
and
north
which
was
unmistakably
a
thrill
of
triumph
men
were
glad
because
of
what
he
had
said
he
had
touched
the
national
awakened
it
and
pleased
it
with
a
morning
vision
of
its
great
tasks
and
certain
destiny
later
there
came
in
the
president
the
redoubtable
andrew
jackson
the
most
memorable
president
between
jefferson
and
lincoln
he
said
very
little
only
on
birthday
he
gave
the
toast
our
federal
union
it
must
be
preserved
but
when
in
in
spite
of
concessions
by
congress
a
convention
was
summoned
in
south
carolina
to
nullify
the
tariff
he
issued
the
appropriate
orders
to
the
united
states
army
in
case
such
action
was
carried
out
and
it
is
understood
that
he
sent
calhoun
private
word
that
he
would
be
the
first
man
to
be
hanged
for
treason
nullification
quietly
collapsed
the
north
was
thrilled
still
more
than
by
oratory
and
as
not
a
single
other
state
showed
signs
of
backing
south
carolina
it
became
thenceforth
the
fixed
belief
of
the
north
that
the
union
was
recognised
as
in
law
indissoluble
as
webster
contended
it
was
none
the
less
the
idea
of
secession
had
been
planted
and
planted
in
a
fertile
soil
general
andrew
jackson
whose
other
great
achievements
must
now
be
told
was
not
an
intellectual
person
but
his
ferocious
and
in
the
literal
sense
shocking
character
is
refreshing
to
the
student
of
this
period
he
had
been
in
his
day
the
typical
product
of
the
west
a
far
wilder
west
than
that
from
which
lincoln
later
came
originally
a
lawyer
he
had
won
martial
fame
in
fights
with
indians
and
in
the
celebrated
victory
over
the
british
forces
at
new
orleans
he
was
a
sincere
puritan
and
he
had
a
courtly
dignity
of
manner
but
he
was
of
arbitrary
and
passionate
temper
and
he
was
a
sanguinary
duellist
his
most
savage
duels
it
should
be
added
concerned
the
honour
of
a
lady
whom
he
married
chivalrously
and
loved
devotedly
to
the
end
the
case
that
can
be
made
for
his
many
arbitrary
acts
shows
them
in
some
instances
to
have
been
justifiable
and
shows
him
in
general
to
have
been
honest
when
in
jackson
had
expected
to
become
president
and
owing
to
proceedings
which
do
not
now
matter
john
quincy
adams
son
of
a
former
president
and
himself
a
remarkable
man
was
made
president
instead
of
him
jackson
resolved
to
overthrow
the
ruling
class
of
virginian
country
gentlemen
and
boston
city
magnates
which
seemed
to
him
to
control
government
and
to
call
into
life
a
real
democracy
to
this
end
he
created
a
new
party
against
which
of
course
an
opposition
party
arose
neither
of
the
new
parties
was
in
any
sense
either
aristocratic
or
democratic
the
democracy
or
democratic
party
has
continued
in
existence
ever
since
and
through
most
of
lincoln
life
ruled
america
in
trying
to
fix
the
character
of
a
party
in
a
foreign
country
we
can
not
hope
to
be
exact
in
our
portraiture
at
the
first
start
however
this
party
was
engaged
in
combating
certain
tendencies
to
government
interference
in
business
it
was
more
especially
hostile
to
a
national
bank
which
jackson
himself
regarded
as
a
most
dangerous
form
of
alliance
between
the
administration
and
the
richest
class
of
the
growth
of
what
may
be
called
the
money
power
in
american
politics
he
had
an
intense
indeed
prophetic
dread
martin
van
buren
his
friend
and
successor
whatever
else
he
may
have
been
was
a
sound
economist
of
what
is
now
called
the
old
school
and
on
a
financial
issue
he
did
what
few
men
in
his
office
have
done
he
deliberately
sacrificed
his
popularity
to
his
principles
beyond
this
the
party
was
and
has
continued
prone
in
a
manner
which
we
had
better
not
too
clearly
define
to
insist
upon
the
restrictions
of
the
constitution
whether
in
the
interest
of
individual
liberty
or
of
state
rights
this
tendency
was
disguised
at
the
first
by
the
arbitrary
action
of
jackson
own
proceedings
for
jackson
alone
among
presidents
displayed
the
sentiments
of
what
may
be
called
a
popular
despot
its
insistence
upon
state
rights
aided
perhaps
by
its
dislike
of
protection
attracted
to
it
the
leading
politicians
of
the
south
who
in
the
main
dominated
its
counsels
though
later
on
they
liked
to
do
it
through
northern
instruments
but
it
must
not
in
the
least
be
imagined
that
either
party
was
northern
or
southern
for
there
were
many
whigs
in
the
south
and
very
many
democrats
in
the
north
moreover
it
should
be
clearly
grasped
though
it
is
hard
that
among
northern
democrats
insistence
on
state
rights
did
not
involve
the
faintest
leaning
towards
the
doctrine
of
secession
on
the
contrary
a
typical
democrat
would
believe
that
these
limitations
to
the
power
of
the
union
were
the
very
things
that
gave
it
endurance
and
strength
slavery
moreover
had
friends
and
foes
in
both
parties
if
we
boldly
attempted
to
define
the
prevailing
tone
of
the
democrats
we
might
say
that
while
they
and
their
opponents
expressed
loyalty
to
the
union
and
the
constitution
the
democrats
would
be
prone
to
lay
the
emphasis
upon
the
constitution
whatever
might
be
the
case
with
an
average
whig
a
man
like
lincoln
would
be
stirred
in
his
heart
by
the
general
spirit
of
the
institutions
while
the
typical
democrat
of
that
time
would
dwell
affectionately
on
the
legal
instruments
and
formal
maxims
in
which
that
spirit
was
embodied
of
the
whigs
it
is
a
little
harder
to
speak
definitely
nor
is
it
very
necessary
for
in
two
only
out
of
seven
presidential
elections
did
they
elect
their
candidate
and
in
each
case
that
candidate
then
died
and
in
they
perished
as
a
party
utterly
and
for
ever
just
for
a
time
they
were
identified
with
the
american
policy
of
clay
when
that
passed
out
of
favour
they
never
really
attempted
to
formulate
any
platform
or
to
take
permanently
any
very
definite
stand
they
nevertheless
had
the
adherence
of
the
ablest
men
of
the
country
and
as
an
opposition
party
to
a
party
in
power
which
furnished
much
ground
for
criticism
they
possessed
an
attraction
for
generous
youth
the
democrats
at
once
and
the
whigs
not
long
after
them
created
elaborate
party
machines
on
the
need
of
which
jackson
insisted
as
the
only
means
of
really
giving
influence
to
the
common
people
the
prevailing
system
and
habit
of
local
made
such
organisation
easy
men
of
one
party
in
a
township
or
in
a
county
assembled
formulated
their
opinions
and
sent
delegates
with
instructions
more
or
less
precise
to
party
conventions
for
larger
areas
these
would
send
delegates
to
the
state
convention
and
these
in
turn
to
the
national
convention
of
the
party
the
party
candidates
for
the
presidency
as
well
as
for
all
other
elective
positions
were
and
are
thus
chosen
and
the
party
platform
or
declaration
of
policy
was
and
is
thus
formulated
such
machinery
which
in
england
is
likely
always
to
play
a
less
important
part
has
acquired
an
evil
name
at
the
best
there
has
always
been
a
risk
that
a
platform
designed
to
detach
voters
from
the
opposite
party
will
be
an
insincere
and
eviscerated
document
by
which
active
public
opinion
is
rather
muzzled
than
expressed
there
has
been
a
risk
too
that
the
available
candidate
should
be
some
blameless
nonentity
to
whom
no
one
objects
and
whom
therefore
no
one
really
wants
but
it
must
be
observed
that
the
rapidity
with
which
such
organisation
was
taken
up
betokened
the
prevalence
of
a
widespread
and
keen
interest
in
political
affairs
the
days
of
really
great
moneyed
interests
and
of
corruption
of
the
gravest
sort
were
as
yet
far
distant
but
one
demoralising
influence
was
imposed
upon
the
new
party
system
by
its
author
at
its
birth
jackson
in
his
perpetual
fury
believed
that
office
holders
under
the
more
or
less
imaginary
ruling
clique
that
had
held
sway
were
a
corrupt
gang
and
he
began
to
turn
them
out
he
was
encouraged
to
extend
to
the
whole
country
a
system
which
had
prevailed
in
new
york
and
with
which
van
buren
was
too
familiar
to
the
victors
belong
the
spoils
exclaimed
a
certain
respectable
marcy
a
wholesale
dismissal
of
office
holders
large
and
small
and
replacement
of
them
by
sound
democrats
soon
took
place
once
started
the
spoils
system
could
hardly
be
stopped
thenceforward
there
was
a
standing
danger
that
the
party
machine
would
be
in
the
hands
of
a
crew
of
jobbers
and
dingy
hunters
after
petty
offices
england
of
course
has
had
and
now
has
practices
theoretically
as
indefensible
but
none
possessing
any
such
sinister
importance
it
is
hard
therefore
for
us
to
conceive
how
little
of
really
vicious
intent
was
necessary
to
set
this
disastrous
influence
going
there
was
no
trained
civil
service
with
its
unpartisan
traditions
in
the
case
of
offices
corresponding
to
those
of
our
permanent
heads
of
departments
it
seemed
reasonable
that
the
official
should
like
his
chief
the
minister
concerned
be
a
person
in
harmony
with
the
president
as
to
the
smaller
offices
the
thousands
of
village
postmasterships
and
so
forth
one
man
was
likely
to
do
the
work
as
well
as
another
the
dispossessed
official
could
in
the
then
condition
of
the
country
easily
find
another
equally
lucrative
employment
turn
and
turn
about
seemed
to
be
the
rule
of
fair
play
there
were
now
few
genuine
issues
in
politics
compromise
on
vital
questions
was
understood
to
be
the
highest
statesmanship
the
constitution
itself
with
its
curious
system
of
checks
and
balances
rendered
it
difficult
to
bring
anything
to
pass
added
to
this
was
a
party
system
with
obvious
natural
weaknesses
infected
from
the
first
with
a
dangerous
malady
the
political
life
which
lay
on
the
surface
of
the
national
life
of
america
thus
began
to
assume
an
air
of
futility
and
it
must
be
added
of
squalor
only
englishmen
recollecting
the
feebleness
and
corruption
which
marked
their
aristocratic
government
through
a
great
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
must
not
enlarge
their
phylacteries
at
the
expense
of
american
democracy
and
it
is
yet
more
important
to
remember
that
the
fittest
machinery
for
popular
government
the
machinery
through
which
the
real
judgment
of
the
people
will
prevail
can
only
by
degrees
and
after
many
failures
be
devised
popular
government
was
then
young
and
it
is
young
still
so
much
for
the
great
world
of
politics
in
those
days
but
in
or
about
a
quaker
named
lundy
had
as
quakers
used
to
say
a
concern
to
walk
miles
through
the
snow
of
a
new
england
winter
and
speak
his
mind
to
william
lloyd
garrison
garrison
was
a
poor
man
who
like
franklin
had
raised
himself
as
a
working
printer
and
was
now
occupied
in
philanthropy
stirred
up
by
lundy
he
succeeded
after
many
painful
experiences
in
gaol
and
among
mobs
in
publishing
in
boston
on
january
the
first
number
of
the
liberator
in
it
he
said
i
shall
strenuously
contend
for
the
immediate
enfranchisement
of
our
slave
population
i
will
be
as
hard
as
truth
and
as
uncompromising
as
justice
i
will
not
equivocate
i
will
not
excuse
i
will
not
retreat
a
single
inch
and
i
will
be
heard
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
new
abolitionist
movement
the
abolitionists
in
the
main
were
impracticable
people
garrison
in
the
end
proved
otherwise
under
the
existing
constitution
they
had
nothing
to
propose
but
that
the
free
states
should
withdraw
from
their
covenant
with
death
and
agreement
with
hell
in
other
words
from
the
union
whereby
they
would
not
have
liberated
one
slave
they
included
possibly
too
many
of
that
sort
who
would
seek
salvation
by
repenting
of
other
men
sins
but
even
these
did
not
indulge
this
propensity
at
their
ease
for
by
this
time
the
politicians
the
polite
world
the
mass
of
the
people
the
churches
even
in
boston
not
merely
avoided
the
dangerous
topic
they
angrily
proscribed
it
the
abolitionists
took
their
lives
in
their
hands
and
sometimes
lost
them
only
two
men
of
standing
helped
them
channing
the
great
preacher
who
sacrificed
thereby
a
fashionable
congregation
and
adams
the
sour
upright
able
the
only
who
ever
made
for
himself
an
in
congress
in
a
still
more
potent
ally
came
to
their
help
a
poor
lady
beecher
stowe
who
in
that
year
published
uncle
tom
cabin
often
said
to
have
influenced
opinion
more
than
any
other
book
of
modern
times
broadly
speaking
they
accomplished
two
things
if
they
did
not
gain
love
in
quarters
where
they
might
have
looked
for
it
they
gained
the
very
valuable
hatred
of
their
enemies
for
they
goaded
southern
politicians
to
fury
and
madness
of
which
the
first
symptom
was
their
effort
to
suppress
abolitionist
petitions
to
congress
but
above
all
they
educated
in
their
labour
of
thirty
years
a
school
of
opinion
not
entirely
in
agreement
with
them
but
ready
one
day
to
revolt
with
decision
from
continued
complicity
in
wrong
and
southern
in
the
midst
of
this
growing
america
a
portion
by
no
means
sharply
marked
off
and
accustomed
to
the
end
to
think
itself
intensely
american
was
distinguished
by
a
peculiar
institution
what
was
the
character
of
that
institution
as
it
presented
itself
in
and
onwards
granting
as
many
slave
holders
did
though
their
leaders
always
denied
it
that
slavery
originated
in
foul
wrongs
and
rested
legally
upon
a
vile
principle
what
did
it
look
like
in
its
practical
working
most
of
us
have
received
from
two
different
sources
two
broad
but
vivid
general
impressions
on
this
subject
which
seem
hard
to
reconcile
but
which
are
both
in
the
main
true
on
the
one
hand
a
visitor
from
england
or
the
north
coming
on
a
visit
to
the
south
or
in
earlier
days
to
the
british
west
indies
expecting
perhaps
to
see
all
the
horror
of
slavery
at
a
glance
would
be
as
a
young
british
officer
once
wrote
home
most
agreeably
undeceived
as
to
the
situation
of
these
poor
people
he
would
discern
at
once
that
a
southern
gentleman
had
no
more
notion
of
using
his
legal
privilege
to
be
cruel
to
his
slave
than
he
himself
had
of
overdriving
his
old
horse
he
might
easily
on
the
contrary
find
quite
ordinary
slave
owners
who
had
a
very
decided
sense
of
responsibility
in
regard
to
their
human
chattels
around
his
host
house
where
the
owner
children
petted
by
a
black
nurse
played
with
the
little
black
children
or
with
some
beloved
old
negro
he
might
see
that
pretty
aspect
of
our
institution
at
the
south
which
undoubtedly
created
in
many
young
southerners
as
they
grew
up
a
certain
amount
of
genuine
sentiment
in
favour
of
slavery
riding
wider
afield
he
might
be
struck
as
general
sherman
was
with
the
contentment
of
the
negroes
whom
he
met
on
the
plantations
on
enquiry
he
would
learn
that
the
slave
in
old
age
was
sure
of
food
and
shelter
and
free
from
work
and
that
as
he
approached
old
age
his
task
was
systematically
diminished
as
to
excessive
toil
at
any
time
of
life
he
would
perhaps
conclude
that
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
drive
a
gang
of
africans
really
hard
he
would
be
assured
quite
incorrectly
that
the
slave
food
and
comfort
generally
were
greater
than
those
of
factory
workers
in
the
north
and
perhaps
only
too
truly
that
his
privations
were
less
than
those
of
the
english
agricultural
labourer
at
that
time
a
wide
and
careful
survey
of
the
subject
was
made
by
frederick
law
olmsted
a
new
york
farmer
who
wrote
what
but
for
their
gloomy
subject
would
be
among
the
best
books
of
travel
he
presents
to
us
the
picture
of
a
prevailingly
sullen
sapless
brutish
life
but
certainly
not
of
acute
misery
or
habitual
oppression
a
southerner
old
enough
to
remember
slavery
would
probably
not
question
the
accuracy
of
his
details
but
would
insist
very
likely
with
truth
that
there
was
more
human
happiness
there
than
an
investigator
on
such
a
quest
would
readily
discover
even
on
large
plantations
in
the
extreme
south
where
the
owner
only
lived
part
of
the
year
and
most
things
had
to
be
left
to
an
almost
always
unsatisfactory
overseer
the
verdict
of
the
observer
was
apt
to
be
not
so
bad
as
i
expected
on
the
other
hand
many
of
us
know
longfellow
grim
poem
of
the
hunted
negro
it
is
a
true
picture
of
the
life
led
in
the
dismal
swamps
of
virginia
by
numbers
of
skulking
fugitives
till
the
industry
of
conducted
with
hounds
of
considerable
value
ultimately
made
their
lairs
untenable
the
scenes
in
the
auction
room
where
perhaps
on
the
death
or
failure
of
their
owner
husbands
and
wives
parents
and
children
were
constantly
being
severed
and
negresses
were
habitually
puffed
as
brood
mares
the
gentleman
who
had
lately
sold
his
to
be
sent
far
south
because
he
was
impudent
the
devilish
cruelty
with
which
almost
the
only
recorded
slave
insurrection
was
stamped
out
the
chase
and
capture
and
return
in
fetters
of
slaves
who
had
escaped
north
or
it
might
be
of
free
negroes
in
their
place
the
advertisements
for
such
runaways
which
dickens
collected
and
which
described
each
by
his
scars
or
mutilations
the
systematic
slave
breeding
for
the
supply
of
the
cotton
states
which
had
become
a
staple
industry
of
the
once
glorious
virginia
the
demand
arising
for
the
restoration
of
the
african
slave
trade
all
these
were
realities
the
southern
people
in
the
phrase
of
president
wilson
knew
that
their
lives
were
honourable
their
relations
with
their
slaves
humane
their
responsibility
for
the
existence
of
slavery
amongst
them
remote
they
burned
with
indignation
when
the
whole
south
was
held
responsible
for
the
occasional
abuses
of
slavery
but
the
harsh
philanthropist
who
denounced
them
indiscriminately
merely
dwelt
on
those
aspects
of
slavery
which
came
to
his
knowledge
or
which
he
actually
saw
on
the
border
line
and
the
occasional
abuses
however
occasional
were
made
by
the
deliberate
choice
of
southern
statesmanship
an
essential
part
of
the
institution
honourable
and
humane
men
in
the
south
scorned
exceedingly
the
slave
hunter
and
the
slave
dealer
a
candid
slave
owner
discussing
uncle
tom
cabin
found
one
detail
flagrantly
unfair
the
ruined
master
would
have
had
to
sell
his
slaves
to
the
brute
legree
but
for
the
world
he
would
not
have
shaken
hands
with
him
your
children
exclaimed
lincoln
may
play
with
the
little
black
children
but
they
must
not
play
with
his
the
slave
dealer
or
the
slave
driver
or
the
slave
hunter
by
that
fact
alone
as
he
bitingly
but
unanswerably
insisted
the
whole
decent
society
of
the
south
condemned
the
foundation
on
which
it
rested
it
is
needless
to
discuss
just
how
dark
or
how
fair
american
slavery
in
its
working
should
be
painted
the
moderate
conclusions
which
are
quite
sufficient
for
our
purpose
are
uncontested
first
this
much
must
certainly
be
conceded
to
those
who
would
defend
the
slave
system
that
in
the
case
of
the
average
slave
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
his
happiness
apart
from
that
of
future
generations
could
be
increased
by
suddenly
turning
him
into
a
free
man
working
for
a
wage
justice
would
certainly
have
demanded
that
the
change
should
be
accompanied
by
other
provisions
for
his
benefit
but
secondly
on
the
refractory
negro
more
vicious
or
sometimes
one
may
suspect
more
manly
than
his
fellows
the
system
was
likely
to
act
barbarously
thirdly
every
slave
family
was
exposed
to
the
risk
on
such
occasions
as
the
death
or
great
impoverishment
of
its
owner
of
being
ruthlessly
torn
asunder
and
the
fact
that
negroes
often
rebounded
or
seemed
to
rebound
from
sorrows
of
this
sort
with
surprising
levity
does
not
much
lessen
the
horror
of
it
fourthly
it
is
inherent
in
slavery
that
its
burden
should
be
most
felt
precisely
by
the
best
minds
and
strongest
characters
among
the
slaves
and
though
the
capacity
of
the
negroes
for
advancement
could
not
then
and
can
not
yet
be
truly
measured
yet
it
existed
and
the
policy
of
the
south
shut
the
door
upon
it
lastly
the
system
abounded
in
brutalising
influences
upon
a
large
number
of
white
people
who
were
accessory
to
it
and
notoriously
it
degraded
the
poor
or
mean
whites
for
whom
it
left
no
industrial
opening
and
among
whom
it
caused
work
to
be
despised
there
is
thus
no
escape
from
lincoln
judgment
if
slavery
is
not
wrong
nothing
is
wrong
it
does
not
follow
that
the
way
to
right
the
wrong
was
simple
or
that
instant
and
unmitigated
emancipation
was
the
best
way
but
it
does
follow
that
failing
this
it
was
for
the
statesmen
of
the
south
to
devise
a
policy
by
which
the
most
flagrant
evils
should
be
stopped
and
however
cautiously
and
experimentally
the
raising
of
the
status
of
the
slave
should
be
proceeded
with
it
does
not
follow
that
the
people
who
on
one
pretext
or
another
shut
their
eyes
to
the
evil
of
the
system
while
they
tried
to
keep
their
personal
dealing
humane
can
be
sweepingly
condemned
by
any
man
but
it
does
follow
that
a
deliberate
and
sustained
policy
which
neglecting
all
reform
strove
at
all
costs
to
perpetuate
the
system
and
extend
it
to
wider
regions
was
as
criminal
a
policy
as
ever
lay
at
the
door
of
any
statesmen
and
this
in
fact
became
the
policy
of
the
south
the
south
meant
for
political
purposes
the
owners
of
land
and
slaves
in
the
greater
part
of
the
states
in
which
slavery
was
lawful
the
poor
whites
never
acquired
the
political
importance
of
the
working
classes
in
the
north
and
count
for
little
in
the
story
some
of
the
more
northerly
slave
states
partook
in
a
greater
degree
of
the
conditions
and
ideas
of
the
north
and
were
doubtfully
to
be
reckoned
with
the
south
moreover
there
is
a
tract
of
mountainous
country
lying
between
the
atlantic
and
the
basin
of
the
mississippi
and
extending
southwards
to
the
borders
of
georgia
and
alabama
of
which
the
very
vigorous
and
independent
inhabitants
were
and
are
in
many
ways
a
people
apart
often
cherishing
to
this
day
family
feuds
which
are
prosecuted
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
icelandic
sagas
the
south
excluding
these
districts
was
predominantly
democratic
in
politics
and
its
leaders
owed
some
allegiance
to
the
tradition
of
radicals
like
jefferson
but
it
was
none
the
less
proud
of
its
aristocracy
and
of
the
permeating
influence
of
aristocratic
manners
and
traditions
a
very
large
number
of
southerners
felt
themselves
to
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
felt
further
that
there
were
few
or
none
like
them
among
the
yankee
traders
of
the
north
a
claim
of
that
sort
is
likely
to
be
aggressively
made
by
those
who
have
least
title
to
make
it
and
as
strife
between
north
and
south
grew
hotter
the
gentility
of
the
latter
infected
with
additional
vulgarity
the
political
controversy
of
private
life
and
even
of
congress
but
as
observant
northerners
were
quite
aware
these
pretensions
had
a
foundation
of
fact
an
englishman
then
or
now
in
chance
meetings
with
americans
of
either
section
would
at
once
be
aware
of
something
indefinable
in
their
bearing
to
which
he
was
a
stranger
but
in
the
case
of
the
southerner
the
strangeness
would
often
have
a
positive
charm
such
as
may
be
found
also
among
people
of
the
old
world
under
southern
latitudes
and
relatively
primitive
conditions
and
wealth
was
in
those
days
olmsted
of
new
york
state
assures
us
as
offensive
in
the
more
recently
developed
and
more
prosperous
parts
of
the
south
as
in
new
york
city
itself
and
throughout
the
south
sound
instruction
and
intellectual
activity
were
markedly
lacking
indeed
there
is
no
serious
southern
literature
by
which
we
can
check
these
impressions
of
his
comparing
the
masses
of
moderately
and
educated
people
with
whom
he
associated
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
he
finds
them
both
free
from
the
peculiar
vulgarity
which
we
may
be
pained
to
know
he
had
discovered
among
us
in
england
he
finds
honesty
and
dishonesty
in
serious
matters
of
conduct
as
prevalent
in
one
section
as
in
the
other
he
finds
the
northerner
better
taught
and
more
alert
in
mind
but
he
ascribes
to
him
an
objectionable
quality
of
smartness
a
determination
to
show
you
that
he
is
a
stirring
and
pushing
fellow
from
which
the
southerner
is
wholly
free
and
he
finds
that
the
southerner
has
derived
from
home
influences
and
from
boarding
schools
in
which
the
influence
of
many
similar
homes
is
concentrated
not
indeed
any
great
refinement
but
a
manner
which
is
more
true
more
quiet
more
modestly
more
dignified
this
advantage
we
are
to
understand
is
diffused
over
a
comparatively
larger
class
than
in
england
beyond
this
he
discerns
in
a
few
parts
of
the
south
and
notably
in
south
carolina
a
somewhat
inaccessible
select
society
of
which
the
nucleus
is
formed
by
a
few
incredibly
few
old
colonial
families
which
have
not
gone
under
and
which
altogether
is
so
small
that
some
old
gentlewomen
can
enumerate
all
the
members
of
it
few
as
they
are
these
form
unquestionably
a
wealthy
and
remarkably
generous
refined
and
accomplished
first
class
clinging
with
some
pertinacity
although
with
too
evident
an
effort
to
the
traditional
manners
and
customs
of
an
established
gentry
no
doubt
the
sense
of
high
breeding
which
was
common
in
the
south
went
beyond
mere
manners
it
played
its
part
in
making
the
struggle
of
the
southern
population
including
the
mean
whites
in
the
civil
war
one
of
the
most
heroic
if
one
of
the
most
mistaken
in
which
a
whole
population
has
ever
been
engaged
it
went
along
with
integrity
and
a
high
average
of
governing
capacity
among
public
men
and
it
fitted
the
gentry
of
the
south
to
contribute
when
they
should
choose
an
element
of
great
value
to
the
common
life
of
america
as
it
was
the
south
suffered
to
the
full
the
political
degeneration
which
threatens
every
powerful
class
which
with
a
distinct
class
interest
of
its
own
is
secluded
from
real
contact
with
competing
classes
with
other
interests
and
other
ideas
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
all
individual
southerners
liked
the
policy
which
they
learnt
to
support
in
docile
masses
but
their
very
qualities
of
loyalty
made
them
the
more
ready
under
accepted
and
respected
leaders
to
adopt
political
aims
and
methods
which
no
man
now
recalls
without
regret
the
connection
between
slavery
and
politics
was
this
as
population
slowly
grew
in
the
south
and
as
the
land
in
the
older
states
became
to
some
extent
exhausted
the
desire
for
fresh
territory
in
which
cultivation
by
slaves
could
flourish
became
stronger
and
stronger
this
was
the
reason
for
which
the
south
became
increasingly
aware
of
a
sectional
interest
in
politics
in
all
other
respects
the
community
of
public
interests
of
business
dealings
and
of
general
intercourse
was
as
great
between
north
and
south
as
between
east
and
west
it
is
certain
that
throughout
the
south
with
the
doubtful
exception
of
south
carolina
political
instinct
and
patriotic
pride
would
have
made
the
idea
of
separation
intolerable
upon
any
ground
except
that
of
slavery
in
regard
to
this
matter
of
dispute
a
peculiar
phenomenon
is
to
be
observed
the
quarrel
grew
not
out
of
any
steady
opposition
between
north
and
south
but
out
of
the
habitual
domination
of
the
country
by
the
south
and
the
submission
of
the
north
to
that
domination
for
the
north
had
its
full
share
of
blame
for
the
long
course
of
proceedings
which
prepared
the
coming
tragedy
and
the
most
impassioned
writers
on
the
side
of
the
union
during
the
civil
war
have
put
that
blame
highest
the
south
became
arrogant
and
and
no
defence
is
possible
for
the
chief
acts
of
southern
policy
which
will
be
recorded
later
but
the
north
was
abject
to
its
own
best
sons
it
seemed
to
have
lost
both
its
conscience
and
its
manhood
and
to
be
stifled
in
the
coils
of
its
own
miserable
political
apparatus
certainly
the
prevailing
attitude
of
the
northern
to
the
southern
politicians
was
that
of
truckling
and
southerners
who
went
to
washington
had
a
further
reason
for
acquiring
a
fatal
sense
of
superiority
to
the
north
the
tradition
of
popular
government
which
maintained
itself
in
the
south
caused
men
who
were
respected
in
private
life
and
were
up
to
a
point
capable
leaders
who
were
in
short
representative
to
be
sent
to
congress
and
to
be
kept
there
the
childish
perversion
of
popular
government
which
took
hold
of
the
newer
and
more
unsettled
population
in
the
north
led
them
to
send
to
congress
an
succession
of
unmeritable
and
sometimes
shady
people
the
eventual
stirring
of
the
mind
of
the
north
which
so
closely
concerns
this
biography
was
a
thing
hard
to
bring
about
and
to
the
south
it
brought
a
great
shock
of
surprise
no
survey
of
the
political
movements
of
this
period
should
conclude
without
directing
attention
to
something
more
important
which
can
not
be
examined
here
in
the
years
from
till
some
time
after
the
death
of
lincoln
america
made
those
contributions
to
the
literature
of
our
common
language
which
though
neither
her
first
nor
her
last
seemed
likely
to
be
most
permanently
valued
the
learning
and
literature
of
america
at
that
time
centred
round
boston
and
harvard
university
in
the
adjacent
city
of
cambridge
and
no
invidious
comparison
is
intended
or
will
be
felt
if
they
with
their
poets
and
historians
and
men
of
letters
at
that
time
with
their
peculiar
atmosphere
instinct
then
and
now
with
a
life
athletic
learned
and
religious
are
taken
to
show
the
dawning
capacities
of
the
new
nation
no
places
in
the
united
states
exhibit
more
visibly
the
kinship
of
america
with
england
yet
in
none
certainly
can
a
stranger
see
more
readily
that
america
is
independent
of
the
old
world
in
something
more
than
politics
many
of
their
streets
and
buildings
would
in
england
seem
redolent
of
the
past
yet
no
cities
of
the
eastern
states
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
development
material
and
mental
of
the
raw
and
vigorous
west
the
limitations
of
their
greatest
writers
are
in
a
manner
the
sign
of
their
achievement
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
all
human
analogy
if
a
country
in
such
an
early
stage
of
creation
out
of
such
a
chaos
had
put
forth
books
marked
strongly
as
its
own
and
yet
as
the
products
of
a
mature
national
mind
it
would
also
have
been
surprising
if
since
the
civil
war
the
rush
of
still
more
appalling
and
more
complex
practical
problems
had
not
obstructed
for
a
while
the
flow
of
imaginative
or
scientific
production
but
the
growth
of
those
relatively
early
years
was
great
boston
had
been
the
home
of
a
loveless
christianity
its
insurrection
in
the
war
of
independence
had
been
soiled
by
shifty
dealing
and
mere
acidity
but
boston
from
the
days
of
emerson
to
those
of
phillips
brooks
radiated
a
temper
and
a
mental
force
that
was
manly
tender
and
clean
the
man
among
these
writers
about
whose
exact
rank
neither
low
nor
very
high
among
poets
there
can
be
least
dispute
was
longfellow
he
might
seem
from
his
favourite
subjects
to
be
hardly
american
it
was
his
deliberately
chosen
task
to
bring
to
the
new
country
some
savour
of
things
gentle
and
mellow
caught
from
the
literature
of
europe
but
in
the
first
place
no
writer
could
in
the
detail
of
his
work
have
been
more
racy
of
that
new
england
countryside
which
lay
round
his
home
and
in
the
second
place
no
writer
could
have
spoken
more
unerringly
to
the
ear
of
the
whole
wide
america
of
which
his
home
was
a
little
part
it
seems
strange
to
couple
the
name
of
this
mild
and
scholarly
man
with
the
thought
of
that
crude
western
world
to
which
we
must
in
a
moment
pass
but
the
connection
is
real
and
vital
it
is
well
shown
in
the
appreciation
written
of
him
and
his
fellows
by
the
american
writer
who
most
violently
contrasts
with
him
walt
whitman
a
student
of
american
history
may
feel
something
like
the
experience
which
is
common
among
travellers
in
america
when
they
come
home
they
can
not
tell
their
friends
what
really
interested
them
ugly
things
and
very
dull
things
are
prominent
in
their
story
as
in
the
tales
of
american
humorists
the
general
impression
they
convey
is
of
something
tiresomely
extensive
distractingly
miscellaneous
and
yet
insufferably
monotonous
but
that
is
not
what
they
mean
they
had
better
not
seek
to
express
themselves
by
too
definite
instances
they
will
be
understood
and
believed
when
they
say
that
to
them
america
with
its
vast
spaces
from
ocean
to
ocean
does
present
itself
as
one
country
not
less
worthy
than
any
other
of
the
love
which
it
has
actually
inspired
a
country
which
is
the
home
of
distinctive
types
of
manhood
and
womanhood
bringing
their
own
addition
to
the
varying
forms
in
which
kindness
and
courage
and
truth
make
themselves
admirable
to
mankind
the
soul
of
a
single
people
seems
to
be
somewhere
present
in
that
great
mass
no
less
than
in
some
tiny
city
state
of
antiquity
only
it
has
to
struggle
submerged
evermore
by
a
flood
of
newcomers
and
defeated
evermore
by
difficulties
quite
unlike
those
of
other
lands
and
it
struggles
seemingly
with
undaunted
and
with
rational
hope
americans
are
fond
of
discussing
americanism
very
often
they
select
as
a
pattern
of
it
abraham
lincoln
the
man
who
kept
the
north
together
but
has
been
pronounced
to
have
been
a
southerner
in
his
inherited
character
whether
he
was
so
typical
or
not
it
is
the
central
fact
of
this
biography
that
no
man
ever
pondered
more
deeply
in
his
own
way
or
answered
more
firmly
the
question
whether
there
was
indeed
an
american
nationality
worth
preserving
chapter
iii
lincoln
early
career
at
new
from
this
talk
of
large
political
movements
we
have
to
recall
ourselves
to
a
young
labouring
man
with
hardly
any
schooling
naturally
and
incurably
uncouth
but
with
a
curious
quite
modest
impulse
to
assert
a
kindly
ascendency
over
the
companions
whom
chance
threw
in
his
way
and
with
something
of
the
gift
which
odd
shy
people
often
possess
for
using
their
very
oddity
as
a
weapon
in
their
struggles
in
the
conditions
of
real
equality
which
still
prevailed
in
a
newly
settled
country
it
is
not
wonderful
that
he
made
his
way
into
political
life
when
he
was
but
it
was
not
till
twenty
years
later
that
he
played
an
important
part
in
events
of
enduring
significance
thus
the
many
years
of
public
activity
with
which
we
are
concerned
in
this
and
the
following
chapter
belong
rather
to
his
apprenticeship
than
to
his
life
work
and
this
apprenticeship
at
first
sight
contrasts
more
strongly
with
his
fame
afterwards
than
does
his
boyhood
of
poverty
and
comparatively
romantic
hardship
for
many
poor
boys
have
lived
to
make
a
great
mark
on
history
but
as
a
rule
they
have
entered
early
on
a
life
either
of
learning
or
of
adventure
or
of
large
business
but
the
affairs
in
which
lincoln
early
became
immersed
have
an
air
of
pettiness
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
most
educated
men
and
women
in
the
eastern
states
or
in
europe
many
of
the
associates
and
competitors
of
his
early
manhood
to
whom
he
had
to
look
up
as
his
superiors
in
knowledge
would
certainly
have
seemed
crude
people
with
a
narrow
horizon
indeed
till
he
was
called
upon
to
take
supreme
control
of
very
great
matters
lincoln
must
have
had
singularly
little
intercourse
either
with
men
versed
in
great
affairs
or
with
men
of
approved
intellectual
distinction
but
a
mind
too
original
to
be
subdued
to
its
surroundings
found
much
that
was
stimulating
in
this
time
when
illinois
was
beginning
rapidly
to
fill
up
there
were
plenty
of
men
with
shrewd
wits
and
robust
character
to
be
met
with
and
the
mental
atmosphere
which
surrounded
him
was
one
of
keen
interest
in
life
lincoln
eventually
stands
out
as
a
surprising
figure
from
among
the
other
lawyers
and
little
politicians
of
illinois
as
any
great
man
does
from
any
crowd
but
some
tribute
is
due
to
the
undistinguished
and
historically
uninteresting
men
whose
generous
appreciation
gave
rapid
way
to
the
poor
queer
youth
and
ultimately
pushed
him
into
a
greater
arena
as
their
selected
champion
in
at
the
age
of
lincoln
returning
from
his
new
orleans
voyage
settled
in
new
salem
to
await
the
arrival
of
his
patron
denton
offutt
with
the
goods
for
a
new
store
in
which
lincoln
was
to
be
his
assistant
the
village
itself
was
three
years
old
it
never
got
much
beyond
a
population
of
one
hundred
and
like
many
similar
little
towns
of
the
west
it
has
long
since
perished
off
the
earth
but
it
was
a
busy
place
for
a
while
and
contrary
to
what
its
name
might
suggest
it
aspired
to
be
rather
fast
it
was
a
and
society
into
which
lincoln
was
launched
he
managed
to
combine
strict
abstinence
from
liquor
with
keen
participation
in
all
its
other
diversions
one
departure
from
total
abstinence
stands
alleged
among
the
feats
of
strength
for
which
he
became
noted
he
hoisted
a
whisky
barrel
of
unspecified
but
evidently
considerable
content
on
to
his
knees
in
a
squatting
posture
and
drank
from
the
bunghole
but
this
very
arduous
potation
stood
alone
offutt
was
some
time
before
he
arrived
with
his
goods
and
lincoln
lived
by
odd
jobs
at
the
very
beginning
one
mentor
graham
a
schoolmaster
officiating
in
some
election
employed
him
as
a
clerk
and
the
clerk
seized
the
occasion
to
make
himself
well
known
to
new
salem
as
a
then
there
was
a
heavy
job
at
and
another
job
in
navigating
the
sangamon
river
offutt
store
was
at
last
set
up
and
for
about
a
year
the
assistant
in
this
important
establishment
had
valuable
opportunities
of
conversation
with
all
new
salem
he
had
also
leisure
for
study
he
had
mentioned
to
the
aforesaid
mentor
graham
his
notion
to
study
english
grammar
and
had
been
introduced
to
a
work
called
kirkham
grammar
which
by
a
walk
of
some
miles
he
could
borrow
from
a
neighbour
this
he
would
read
lying
full
length
on
the
counter
with
his
head
on
a
parcel
of
calico
at
other
odd
times
he
would
work
away
at
arithmetic
offutt
kindly
interest
procured
him
distinction
in
another
field
at
clary
grove
near
new
salem
lived
a
formidable
set
of
young
ruffians
over
whose
somewhat
disguised
chivalry
of
temper
the
staid
historian
of
youth
becomes
rapturous
they
were
given
to
wrecking
the
store
of
any
new
salem
tradesman
who
offended
them
so
it
shows
some
spirit
in
denton
offutt
that
he
backed
his
abraham
lincoln
to
beat
their
jack
armstrong
in
a
wrestling
match
he
did
beat
him
moreover
some
charm
in
the
way
he
bore
himself
made
him
thenceforth
not
hated
but
beloved
of
clary
grove
in
general
and
the
armstrongs
in
particular
hannah
armstrong
jack
wife
thereafter
mended
and
patched
his
clothes
for
him
and
years
later
he
had
the
satisfaction
as
their
unfeed
advocate
of
securing
the
acquittal
of
their
son
from
a
charge
of
murder
of
which
there
is
some
reason
to
hope
he
may
not
have
been
guilty
it
is
by
the
way
a
relief
to
tell
that
there
once
was
a
noted
wrestling
match
in
which
lincoln
was
beaten
it
is
characteristic
of
the
country
that
his
friends
were
sure
there
was
foul
play
and
characteristic
of
him
that
he
indignantly
denied
it
within
a
year
offutt
store
in
the
phrase
of
the
time
petered
out
leaving
lincoln
shiftless
but
the
victor
of
clary
grove
with
his
added
mastery
of
kirkham
grammar
was
now
ripe
for
public
life
moreover
his
experience
as
a
waterman
gave
him
ideas
on
the
question
which
then
agitated
his
neighbours
whether
the
sangamon
river
could
be
made
navigable
he
had
a
scheme
of
his
own
for
doing
this
and
in
the
spring
of
he
wrote
to
the
local
paper
a
boyish
but
modest
and
sensible
statement
of
his
views
and
ambitions
announcing
that
he
would
be
a
candidate
in
the
autumn
elections
for
the
state
legislature
meanwhile
he
had
his
one
experience
of
soldiering
the
indian
chief
black
hawk
who
had
agreed
to
abide
west
of
the
mississippi
broke
the
treaty
and
led
his
warriors
back
into
their
former
haunts
in
northern
illinois
the
governor
of
the
state
called
for
volunteers
and
lincoln
became
one
he
obtained
the
elective
rank
of
captain
of
his
company
and
contrived
to
maintain
some
sort
of
order
in
that
doubtless
brave
but
undisciplined
body
he
saw
no
fighting
but
he
could
earn
his
living
for
some
months
and
stored
up
material
for
effective
chaff
in
congress
long
afterwards
about
the
military
glory
which
general
supporters
for
the
presidency
wished
to
attach
to
their
candidate
his
most
glorious
exploit
consisted
in
saving
from
his
own
men
a
poor
old
friendly
indian
who
had
fallen
among
them
a
letter
of
credentials
which
the
helpless
creature
produced
was
pronounced
a
forgery
and
he
was
about
to
be
hanged
as
a
spy
when
lincoln
appeared
on
the
scene
swarthy
with
resolution
and
rage
and
somehow
terrified
his
disorderly
company
into
dropping
their
prey
the
war
ended
in
time
for
a
brief
candidature
and
a
supporter
of
his
at
the
time
preserved
a
record
of
one
of
his
speeches
his
last
important
speech
will
hereafter
be
given
in
full
for
other
reasons
this
may
be
so
given
too
for
it
is
not
a
hundred
words
long
fellow
citizens
i
presume
you
all
know
who
i
am
i
am
humble
abraham
lincoln
i
have
been
solicited
by
many
friends
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
my
politics
are
short
and
sweet
like
the
old
woman
dance
i
am
in
favour
of
a
national
bank
i
am
in
favour
of
the
internal
improvement
system
and
a
high
protective
tariff
these
are
my
sentiments
and
political
principles
if
elected
i
shall
be
thankful
if
not
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
this
succinct
declaration
of
policy
may
be
added
from
his
earlier
letter
that
he
advocated
a
law
against
usury
and
laws
for
the
improvement
of
education
the
principles
of
the
speech
are
those
which
the
new
whig
party
was
upholding
against
the
democrats
under
jackson
the
president
and
van
buren
lincoln
neighbours
like
the
people
of
illinois
generally
were
almost
entirely
on
the
side
of
the
democrats
it
is
interesting
that
however
he
came
by
his
views
they
were
early
and
permanently
fixed
on
the
side
then
unpopular
in
illinois
and
it
is
interesting
that
though
naturally
not
elected
he
secured
very
nearly
the
whole
of
the
votes
of
his
immediate
neighbourhood
the
penniless
lincoln
was
now
hankering
to
become
a
lawyer
though
with
some
thoughts
of
the
more
practicable
career
of
a
blacksmith
unexpectedly
however
he
was
tempted
into
his
one
venture
singularly
unsuccessful
in
business
two
gentlemen
named
herndon
cousins
of
a
biographer
of
lincoln
started
a
store
in
new
salem
and
got
tired
of
it
one
sold
his
share
to
a
berry
the
other
sold
his
to
lincoln
the
latter
sale
was
entirely
on
credit
no
money
passed
at
the
time
because
there
was
no
money
the
vendor
explained
afterwards
that
he
relied
solely
on
lincoln
honesty
he
had
to
wait
a
long
while
for
full
payment
but
what
is
known
of
storekeeping
in
new
salem
shows
that
he
did
very
well
for
himself
in
getting
out
of
his
venture
as
he
did
berry
and
lincoln
next
acquired
likewise
for
credit
the
stock
and
goodwill
of
two
other
storekeepers
one
of
them
the
victim
of
a
raid
from
clary
grove
the
senior
partner
then
applied
himself
diligently
to
personal
consumption
of
the
firm
liquid
goods
the
junior
member
of
the
firm
was
devoted
in
part
to
intellectual
and
humorous
converse
with
the
male
customers
but
a
fatal
shyness
prevented
him
from
talking
to
the
ladles
for
the
rest
he
walked
long
distances
to
borrow
books
got
through
gibbon
and
through
history
of
the
world
began
his
study
of
blackstone
and
acquired
a
settled
habit
of
reading
novels
so
business
languished
early
in
berry
and
lincoln
sold
out
to
another
adventurer
this
also
was
a
credit
transaction
the
purchaser
without
avoidable
delay
failed
and
disappeared
berry
then
died
of
drink
leaving
to
lincoln
the
sole
responsibility
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership
lincoln
could
with
no
difficulty
and
not
much
reproach
have
freed
himself
by
bankruptcy
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
ultimately
paid
everything
but
it
took
him
about
fifteen
years
of
striving
and
pinching
himself
lincoln
is
one
of
the
many
public
characters
to
whom
the
standing
epithet
honest
became
attached
in
his
case
the
claim
to
this
rested
originally
on
the
only
conclusive
authority
that
of
his
creditors
but
there
is
equally
good
authority
that
of
his
biographer
william
herndon
for
many
years
his
partner
as
a
lawyer
that
he
had
no
money
sense
this
must
be
understood
with
the
large
qualification
that
he
meant
to
pay
his
way
and
unlike
the
great
statesmen
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
england
did
pay
it
but
though
with
much
experience
of
poverty
in
his
early
career
he
never
developed
even
a
reasonable
desire
to
be
rich
wealth
remained
in
his
view
a
superfluity
of
the
things
one
does
not
want
he
was
always
interested
in
mathematics
but
mainly
as
a
discipline
in
thinking
and
partly
perhaps
in
association
with
mechanical
problems
of
which
he
was
fond
enough
to
have
once
in
his
life
patented
an
invention
the
interest
never
led
him
to
take
to
accounts
or
to
financial
provisions
in
later
days
when
he
received
a
payment
for
his
fees
his
share
would
be
paid
then
and
there
and
perhaps
the
rent
would
be
paid
and
the
balance
would
be
spent
at
once
in
groceries
and
other
goods
likely
to
be
soon
wanted
including
at
long
intervals
when
the
need
was
very
urgent
a
new
hat
these
are
amiable
personal
traits
but
they
mark
the
limitations
of
his
capacity
as
a
statesman
the
chief
questions
which
agitated
the
illinois
legislature
were
economic
and
so
at
first
were
the
issues
between
whigs
and
democrats
in
federal
policy
lincoln
though
he
threw
himself
into
these
affairs
with
youthful
fervour
would
appear
never
to
have
had
much
grasp
of
such
matters
in
this
respect
alone
writes
an
admirer
i
have
always
considered
lincoln
a
weak
man
it
is
only
when
rarely
at
first
constitutional
or
moral
issues
emerge
that
his
politics
become
interesting
we
can
guess
the
causes
which
attached
him
to
the
whigs
as
the
party
out
of
power
and
in
illinois
quite
out
of
favour
they
had
doubtless
some
advantage
in
character
as
we
have
seen
the
greatest
minds
among
american
statesmen
of
that
day
webster
and
clay
were
whigs
lincoln
simple
and
quite
reasonable
if
inconclusive
argument
for
protection
can
be
found
among
his
speeches
of
some
years
later
and
schemes
of
internal
development
certainly
fired
his
imagination
after
his
failure
in
business
lincoln
subsisted
for
a
while
on
odd
jobs
for
farmers
but
was
soon
employed
as
assistant
surveyor
by
john
calhoun
then
surveyor
of
the
county
this
gentleman
who
had
been
educated
as
a
lawyer
but
taught
school
in
preference
was
a
keen
democrat
and
had
to
assure
lincoln
that
office
as
his
assistant
would
not
necessitate
his
desertion
of
his
principles
he
was
a
clever
man
and
lincoln
remembered
him
long
after
as
the
most
formidable
antagonist
he
ever
met
in
debate
with
the
help
again
of
mentor
graham
lincoln
soon
learned
the
surveyor
business
he
continued
at
this
work
till
he
was
able
to
start
as
a
lawyer
and
there
is
evidence
that
his
surveys
of
property
were
done
with
extreme
accuracy
soon
he
further
obtained
the
local
postmastership
this
the
only
position
except
the
presidency
itself
which
he
ever
held
in
the
federal
government
was
not
onerous
for
the
mails
were
infrequent
he
carried
the
office
around
in
his
hat
we
are
glad
to
be
told
that
his
administration
gave
satisfaction
once
calamity
threatened
him
a
creditor
distrained
on
the
horse
and
the
instruments
necessary
to
his
surveyorship
but
lincoln
was
reputed
to
be
a
helpful
fellow
and
friends
were
ready
to
help
him
they
bought
the
horse
and
instruments
back
for
him
to
this
time
belongs
his
first
acquaintance
with
some
writers
of
unsettling
tendency
tom
paine
voltaire
and
volney
who
was
then
recognised
as
one
of
the
dangerous
authors
strange
feats
of
strength
or
of
usefulness
with
axe
or
hammer
or
scythe
and
a
passion
for
mimicry
continue
in
he
became
a
candidate
again
ca
the
party
raise
any
better
material
than
that
asked
a
bystander
before
a
speech
of
his
after
it
he
exclaimed
that
the
speaker
knew
more
than
all
the
other
candidates
put
together
this
time
he
was
elected
being
then
and
thereafter
he
was
returned
for
three
further
terms
of
two
years
shortly
before
his
second
election
in
the
state
capital
was
removed
to
springfield
in
his
own
county
there
in
lincoln
fixed
his
home
he
had
long
been
reading
law
in
his
curious
spasmodically
concentrated
way
and
he
had
practised
a
little
as
a
pettifogger
that
is
an
unlicensed
practitioner
in
the
inferior
courts
he
had
now
obtained
his
license
and
was
very
shortly
taken
into
partnership
by
an
old
friend
in
springfield
the
illinois
here
his
youth
may
be
said
to
end
springfield
was
a
different
place
from
new
salem
there
were
carriages
in
it
and
ladles
who
studied
poetry
and
the
fashions
there
were
families
from
virginia
and
kentucky
who
were
conscious
of
ancestry
while
graver
possibly
more
pushing
people
from
the
states
soon
to
outnumber
them
were
a
little
inclined
to
ridicule
what
they
called
their
illusory
ascendency
there
was
a
brisk
competition
of
churches
and
mutual
improvement
societies
such
as
the
young
men
lyceum
had
a
rival
claim
to
attention
with
races
and
and
it
was
an
altered
abraham
lincoln
that
came
to
inhabit
springfield
arriving
a
day
or
two
before
his
first
law
partnership
was
settled
he
came
into
the
shop
of
a
thriving
young
tradesman
joshua
speed
to
ask
about
the
price
of
the
cheapest
bedding
and
other
necessary
articles
the
sum
for
which
lincoln
who
had
not
one
cent
would
have
had
to
ask
and
would
have
been
readily
allowed
credit
was
only
seventeen
dollars
but
this
huge
prospect
of
debt
so
visibly
depressed
him
that
speed
instantly
proposed
an
arrangement
which
involved
no
money
debt
he
took
him
upstairs
and
installed
him
western
domestic
arrangements
were
and
are
still
simple
as
the
joint
occupant
of
his
own
large
bed
well
speed
i
moved
was
the
terse
acknowledgment
speed
was
to
move
him
later
by
more
precious
charity
we
are
concerned
for
the
moment
with
what
moved
speed
i
looked
up
at
him
said
he
long
after
and
i
thought
then
as
i
think
now
that
i
never
saw
so
gloomy
and
melancholy
a
face
in
my
life
the
struggle
of
ambition
and
poverty
may
well
have
been
telling
on
lincoln
but
besides
that
a
tragical
love
story
shortly
to
be
told
had
left
a
deep
and
permanent
mark
but
these
influences
worked
we
may
suppose
upon
a
disposition
quite
as
prone
to
sadness
as
to
mirth
his
exceedingly
gregarious
habit
drawing
him
to
almost
any
assembly
of
his
own
sex
continued
all
his
life
but
it
alternated
from
the
first
with
a
habit
of
solitude
or
abstraction
the
abstraction
of
a
man
who
when
he
does
wish
to
read
will
read
intently
in
the
midst
of
crowd
or
noise
or
walking
along
the
street
he
was
what
might
unkindly
be
called
almost
a
professional
humorist
the
master
of
a
thousand
startling
stories
delightful
to
the
hearer
but
possibly
tiresome
in
written
reminiscences
but
we
know
too
well
that
gifts
of
this
kind
are
as
compatible
with
sadness
as
they
certainly
are
with
deadly
seriousness
the
legislature
of
illinois
in
the
eight
years
from
to
in
which
lincoln
belonged
to
it
was
though
not
a
wise
a
vigorous
body
in
the
conditions
which
then
existed
it
was
not
likely
to
have
been
captured
as
the
legislatures
of
wilder
and
more
states
have
sometimes
been
by
a
disreputable
element
in
the
community
nor
to
have
subsided
into
the
hands
of
the
dull
mechanical
class
of
professional
politicians
with
which
rightly
or
wrongly
we
have
now
been
led
to
associate
american
state
government
the
fact
of
own
election
suggests
that
dishonest
adventurers
might
easily
have
got
there
but
equally
suggests
that
a
very
different
type
of
men
prevailed
the
legislature
we
are
told
contained
the
youth
and
blood
and
fire
of
the
frontier
among
the
democrats
in
the
legislature
was
stephen
douglas
who
was
to
become
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
the
united
states
while
lincoln
was
still
unknown
and
several
of
lincoln
whig
colleagues
were
afterwards
to
play
distinguished
or
honourable
parts
in
politics
or
war
we
need
not
linger
over
them
but
what
we
know
of
those
with
whom
he
had
any
special
intimacy
makes
it
entirely
pleasant
to
associate
him
with
them
after
a
short
time
in
which
like
any
sensible
young
member
of
an
assembly
he
watched
and
hardly
ever
spoke
lincoln
soon
made
his
way
among
these
men
and
in
and
the
whig
members
though
being
in
a
minority
they
could
not
elect
him
gave
him
their
unanimous
votes
for
the
speakership
of
the
assembly
the
business
which
engrossed
the
legislature
at
least
up
to
was
the
development
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
state
these
were
great
it
was
natural
that
railways
canals
and
other
public
works
to
develop
them
should
be
pushed
forward
at
the
public
cost
other
new
countries
since
with
less
excuse
because
with
greater
warning
from
experience
have
plunged
in
this
matter
and
though
the
governor
protested
the
illinois
legislature
whigs
and
democrats
lincoln
and
every
one
else
plunged
gaily
so
that
during
the
collapse
which
followed
illinois
though
like
lincoln
himself
it
paid
its
debts
in
the
end
was
driven
in
to
suspend
interest
payments
for
several
years
very
little
is
recorded
of
lincoln
legislative
doings
what
is
related
chiefly
exhibits
his
delight
in
the
game
of
negotiation
and
combination
by
which
he
and
the
other
members
for
his
county
together
known
as
the
long
nine
advanced
the
particular
projects
which
pleased
their
constituents
or
struck
their
own
fancy
thus
he
early
had
a
hand
in
the
removal
of
the
capital
from
vandalia
to
springfield
in
his
own
county
the
map
of
illinois
suggests
that
springfield
was
a
better
site
for
the
purpose
than
vandalia
and
at
least
as
good
as
jacksonville
or
peoria
or
any
of
its
other
competitors
of
his
few
recorded
speeches
one
concerns
a
proposed
inquiry
into
some
alleged
impropriety
in
the
allotment
of
shares
in
the
state
bank
it
is
certainly
the
speech
of
a
bold
man
it
argues
with
remarkable
directness
that
whereas
a
committee
of
prominent
citizens
which
had
already
inquired
into
this
matter
consisted
of
men
of
known
honesty
the
proposed
committee
of
the
legislators
whom
he
was
addressing
would
consist
of
men
who
for
all
he
knew
might
be
honest
and
for
all
he
knew
might
not
the
federal
politics
of
this
time
though
lincoln
played
an
active
local
part
in
the
campaigns
of
the
whig
party
concern
us
little
the
whigs
to
whom
he
did
subordinate
service
were
as
has
been
said
an
unlucky
party
in
in
the
reaction
which
extreme
commercial
depression
created
against
the
previously
omnipotent
democrats
the
whig
candidate
for
the
presidency
was
successful
this
was
general
harrison
a
respected
soldier
of
the
last
war
who
was
glorified
as
a
sort
of
cincinnatus
and
elected
after
an
outburst
of
enthusiastic
tomfoolery
such
as
never
before
or
since
rejoiced
the
american
people
but
president
harrison
had
hardly
been
in
office
a
month
when
he
died
some
say
he
was
worried
to
death
by
office
seekers
but
a
more
prosaic
cause
pneumonia
can
also
be
alleged
it
is
satisfactory
that
this
good
man
grandson
worthily
filled
his
office
years
after
but
his
immediate
successor
was
of
course
the
tyler
chosen
as
an
influential
opponent
of
the
last
democrat
presidents
but
not
because
he
agreed
with
the
whigs
cultivated
but
highly
independent
and
wholly
perverse
he
satisfied
no
aspiration
of
the
whigs
and
paved
the
way
effectually
for
the
democrat
who
succeeded
him
throughout
these
years
lincoln
was
of
course
working
at
law
which
became
with
the
development
of
the
country
a
more
arduous
and
a
more
learned
profession
sessions
of
the
legislature
did
not
last
long
and
political
canvasses
were
only
occasional
if
lincoln
was
active
in
these
matters
he
was
in
many
other
directions
too
a
keen
participator
in
the
keen
life
of
the
society
round
him
nevertheless
politics
as
such
and
apart
from
any
large
purpose
to
be
achieved
through
them
had
for
many
years
a
special
fascination
for
him
for
one
thing
he
was
argumentative
in
the
best
sense
with
a
passion
for
what
the
greeks
sometimes
called
dialectic
his
rare
capacity
for
solitary
thought
the
most
marked
and
the
greatest
of
his
powers
went
absolutely
hand
in
hand
with
the
desire
to
reduce
his
thoughts
to
a
form
which
would
carry
logical
conviction
to
others
further
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
such
a
combination
of
tastes
though
it
seems
to
be
uncommon
is
quite
intelligible
that
the
somewhat
unholy
business
of
party
management
was
at
first
attractive
to
him
to
the
end
he
showed
no
intuitive
comprehension
of
individual
men
his
sincere
friendly
intention
the
unanswerable
force
of
an
argument
the
convincing
analogy
veiled
in
an
unseemly
story
must
take
their
chance
of
suiting
the
particular
taste
of
senator
sherman
or
general
mcclellan
but
any
question
of
managing
men
in
the
mass
will
a
given
candidate
influence
with
this
section
of
people
count
for
more
than
his
unpopularity
with
that
section
and
so
on
involved
an
element
of
subtle
and
calculation
which
was
vastly
congenial
to
him
we
are
to
see
him
hereafter
applying
this
sort
of
science
on
a
grand
scale
and
for
a
great
end
his
early
discipline
in
it
is
a
dull
subject
interesting
only
where
it
displays
as
it
sometimes
does
the
perfect
fairness
with
which
this
ambitious
man
could
treat
his
own
claims
as
against
those
of
a
colleague
and
competitor
in
forming
any
judgment
of
lincoln
career
it
must
further
be
realised
that
while
he
was
growing
up
as
a
statesman
the
prevailing
conception
of
popular
government
was
all
the
time
becoming
more
unfavourable
to
leadership
and
to
robust
individuality
the
new
party
machinery
adopted
by
the
democrats
under
jackson
as
the
proper
mode
of
securing
government
by
the
people
induced
a
deadly
uniformity
of
utterance
breach
of
that
uniformity
was
not
only
rash
but
improper
once
in
early
days
it
was
demanded
in
a
newspaper
that
all
candidates
should
show
their
hands
agreed
writes
lincoln
here
mine
and
then
follows
a
young
man
avowal
of
advanced
opinions
he
would
give
the
suffrage
to
all
whites
who
pay
taxes
or
bear
arms
by
no
means
excluding
females
disraeli
who
was
lincoln
contemporary
throve
by
exuberances
quite
as
startling
as
this
nor
has
any
english
politician
found
it
damaging
to
be
bold
on
this
occasion
indeed
in
lincoln
was
far
from
damaging
himself
the
whigs
had
not
till
a
few
years
later
been
induced
for
to
copy
the
democratic
machine
but
it
is
striking
that
the
admiring
friend
who
reports
this
declaration
too
audacious
and
emphatic
for
the
statesmen
of
a
later
day
must
carefully
explain
how
it
could
possibly
suit
the
temper
of
a
time
which
in
a
few
years
passed
away
very
soon
the
question
whether
a
proposal
or
even
a
sentiment
was
timely
or
premature
came
to
bulk
too
large
in
the
deliberations
of
lincoln
friends
the
reader
will
perhaps
wonder
later
whether
such
considerations
did
not
bulk
too
largely
in
lincoln
own
mind
was
there
in
his
statesmanship
even
in
later
days
when
he
had
great
work
to
do
an
element
of
that
opportunism
which
if
not
actually
base
is
at
least
cheap
or
did
he
come
as
near
as
a
man
with
many
human
weaknesses
could
come
to
the
wise
and
nobly
calculated
opportunism
which
is
not
merely
the
most
beneficent
statesmanship
but
demands
a
heroic
the
main
interest
of
his
doings
in
illinois
politics
and
in
congress
is
the
help
they
may
give
in
penetrating
his
later
mind
on
the
one
hand
it
is
certain
that
lincoln
trained
himself
to
be
a
great
student
of
the
fitting
opportunity
he
evidently
paid
very
serious
attention
to
the
counsels
of
friends
who
would
check
his
rasher
impulses
one
of
his
closest
associates
insists
that
his
impulsive
judgment
was
bad
and
he
probably
thought
so
himself
it
will
be
seen
later
that
the
most
momentous
utterance
he
ever
made
was
kept
back
through
the
whole
space
of
two
years
of
crisis
at
the
instance
of
timid
friends
it
required
not
less
courage
and
was
certainly
more
effective
when
at
last
it
did
come
out
the
same
great
capacity
for
waiting
marks
any
steps
that
he
took
for
his
own
advancement
indeed
it
was
a
happy
thing
for
him
and
for
his
country
that
his
character
and
the
whole
cast
of
his
ideas
and
sympathies
were
of
a
kind
to
which
the
restraint
imposed
on
an
american
politician
was
most
congenial
and
to
which
therefore
it
could
do
least
harm
he
was
to
prove
himself
a
patient
man
in
other
ways
as
well
as
this
on
many
things
perhaps
on
most
the
thoughts
he
worked
out
in
his
own
mind
diverged
very
widely
from
those
of
his
neighbours
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
anxious
either
to
conceal
or
to
obtrude
them
his
social
philosophy
as
he
expressed
it
to
his
friends
in
these
days
was
one
which
contemplated
great
future
reforms
abolition
of
slavery
and
a
strict
temperance
policy
were
among
them
but
he
looked
for
them
with
a
sort
of
fatalistic
confidence
in
the
ultimate
victory
of
reason
and
saw
no
use
and
a
good
deal
of
harm
in
premature
political
agitation
for
them
all
such
questions
he
is
reported
to
have
said
must
find
lodgment
with
the
most
enlightened
souls
who
stamp
them
with
their
approval
in
god
own
time
they
will
be
organised
into
law
and
thus
woven
into
the
fabric
of
our
institutions
this
seems
a
little
but
perhaps
we
can
already
begin
to
recognise
the
man
who
when
the
time
had
fully
come
would
be
on
the
right
side
and
in
whom
the
evil
which
he
had
deeply
but
restrainedly
hated
would
find
an
appallingly
wary
foe
but
there
were
crucial
instances
which
test
sufficiently
whether
this
wary
politician
was
a
true
man
or
not
the
soil
of
illinois
was
free
soil
by
the
ordinance
of
and
congress
would
only
admit
it
to
the
union
as
a
free
state
but
it
had
been
largely
peopled
from
the
south
there
had
been
much
agitation
against
this
restriction
prevailing
sentiment
to
a
late
date
strongly
approved
of
slavery
it
was
at
alton
in
illinois
that
in
elijah
lovejoy
an
abolitionist
publisher
had
been
martyred
by
the
mob
which
had
failed
to
intimidate
him
in
when
the
bold
agitation
of
the
abolitionists
was
exciting
much
disapproval
the
illinois
legislature
passed
resolutions
condemning
that
agitation
and
declaring
in
soothing
tones
the
constitutional
powerlessness
of
congress
to
interfere
with
slavery
in
the
southern
states
now
lincoln
himself
whether
for
good
reasons
or
bad
must
be
considered
later
thoroughly
disapproved
of
the
actual
agitation
of
the
abolitionists
and
the
resolutions
in
question
but
for
one
merely
theoretical
point
of
law
and
for
an
unctuous
misuse
of
the
adjective
sacred
contained
nothing
which
he
could
not
literally
have
accepted
the
objection
to
them
lay
in
the
motive
which
made
it
worth
while
to
pass
them
lincoln
drew
up
and
placed
on
the
records
of
the
house
a
protest
against
these
resolutions
he
defines
in
it
his
own
quite
conservative
opinions
he
deprecates
the
promulgation
of
abolition
doctrines
but
he
does
so
because
it
tends
rather
to
increase
than
abate
the
evils
of
slavery
and
he
lays
down
that
the
institution
of
slavery
is
founded
on
both
injustice
and
bad
policy
one
man
alone
could
he
induce
to
sign
this
protest
with
him
and
that
man
was
not
seeking
by
lincoln
had
grown
sensibly
older
and
a
little
less
ready
we
may
take
it
to
provoke
unnecessary
antagonism
probably
very
old
members
of
free
churches
are
the
people
best
able
to
appreciate
the
daring
of
the
following
utterance
speaking
on
washington
birthday
in
a
presbyterian
church
to
a
temperance
society
formed
among
the
rougher
people
of
the
town
and
including
former
drunkards
who
desired
to
reform
themselves
he
broke
out
in
protest
against
the
doctrine
that
respectable
persons
should
shun
the
company
of
people
tempted
to
intemperance
if
he
said
they
believe
as
they
profess
that
omnipotence
condescended
to
take
upon
himself
the
form
of
sinful
man
and
as
such
die
an
ignominious
death
surely
they
will
not
refuse
submission
to
the
infinitely
lesser
condescension
for
the
temporal
and
perhaps
eternal
salvation
of
a
large
erring
and
unfortunate
class
of
their
fellow
creatures
nor
is
the
condescension
very
great
in
my
judgment
such
of
us
as
have
never
fallen
victims
have
been
spared
more
from
the
absence
of
appetite
than
from
any
mental
or
moral
superiority
over
those
who
have
indeed
i
believe
if
we
take
habitual
drunkards
as
a
class
that
their
heads
and
their
hearts
will
bear
an
advantageous
comparison
with
those
of
any
other
class
it
proved
at
a
later
day
very
lucky
for
america
that
the
virtuous
lincoln
who
did
not
drink
strong
drink
nor
it
is
sad
to
say
smoke
nor
which
is
all
to
the
good
chew
did
feel
like
that
about
drunkenness
but
there
was
great
and
loud
wrath
it
a
shame
said
one
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
abuse
us
so
in
the
house
of
the
lord
it
is
certain
that
in
this
sort
of
way
he
did
himself
a
good
deal
of
injury
as
an
aspiring
politician
it
is
also
the
fact
that
he
continued
none
the
less
persistently
in
a
missionary
work
conceived
in
a
spirit
none
the
less
christian
because
it
shocked
many
pious
people
the
private
life
of
lincoln
continued
and
for
many
years
increasingly
to
be
equally
marked
by
indiscriminate
sociability
and
brooding
loneliness
comfort
and
the
various
influences
which
may
be
associated
with
the
american
word
elegance
seem
never
to
enter
into
it
what
is
more
little
can
be
discerned
of
positive
happiness
in
the
background
of
his
life
as
the
freakish
elasticity
of
his
youth
disappeared
and
after
a
certain
measure
of
marked
success
the
further
objects
of
his
ambition
though
not
dropped
became
unlikely
of
attainment
and
seemed
we
may
guess
of
doubtful
value
all
along
he
was
being
moulded
for
endurance
rather
than
for
enjoyment
nor
though
his
children
evidently
brought
him
happiness
does
what
we
know
of
his
domesticities
and
dearest
affections
weaken
this
general
impression
when
he
married
he
had
gone
through
a
saddening
experience
he
started
on
manhood
with
a
sound
and
chivalrous
outlook
on
women
in
general
and
a
nervous
terror
of
actual
women
when
he
met
them
in
new
salem
days
he
absented
himself
from
meals
for
the
whole
time
that
some
ladies
were
staying
at
his
boarding
house
his
clothes
and
his
lack
of
upbringing
must
have
weighed
with
him
besides
his
natural
disposition
none
the
less
of
course
he
fell
in
love
miss
ann
rutledge
the
daughter
of
a
store
and
tavern
keeper
from
kentucky
with
whom
lincoln
was
boarding
in
has
been
described
as
of
exquisite
beauty
some
say
this
is
but
speak
strongly
of
her
grace
and
charm
a
lady
who
knew
her
gives
these
curiously
collocated
particulars
miss
rutledge
had
auburn
hair
blue
eyes
fair
complexion
she
was
pretty
slightly
slender
but
in
everything
a
young
woman
she
was
about
five
feet
two
inches
high
and
weighed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
she
was
beloved
by
all
who
knew
her
she
died
as
it
were
of
grief
in
speaking
of
her
death
and
her
grave
lincoln
once
said
to
me
heart
lies
buried
there
the
poor
girl
when
lincoln
first
came
courting
to
her
had
passed
through
a
grievous
agitation
she
had
been
engaged
to
a
young
man
who
suddenly
returned
to
his
home
in
the
eastern
states
after
revealing
to
her
with
some
explanation
which
was
more
convincing
to
her
than
to
her
friends
that
he
had
been
passing
under
an
assumed
name
it
seems
that
his
absence
was
strangely
prolonged
that
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
hear
from
him
that
his
letters
when
they
did
come
puzzled
her
that
she
clung
to
him
long
but
yielded
at
last
to
her
friends
who
urged
their
very
natural
suspicions
upon
her
it
is
further
suggested
that
there
was
some
good
explanation
of
his
conduct
all
the
while
and
that
she
learnt
this
too
late
when
actually
engaged
to
lincoln
however
that
may
be
shortly
after
her
engagement
to
lincoln
she
fell
seriously
ill
insisted
as
she
lay
ill
on
a
long
interview
with
lincoln
alone
and
a
day
or
two
later
died
this
was
in
when
he
was
it
is
perhaps
right
to
say
that
one
biographer
throws
doubt
on
the
significance
of
this
story
in
life
the
details
as
to
ann
rutledge
earlier
lover
are
vague
and
uncertain
the
main
facts
of
lincoln
first
engagement
and
almost
immediate
loss
of
his
betrothed
are
quite
certain
the
blow
would
have
been
staggering
enough
to
any
ordinary
young
lover
and
we
know
nothing
of
lincoln
which
would
discredit
herndon
judgment
that
its
effect
on
him
was
both
acute
and
permanent
there
can
be
no
real
doubt
that
his
spells
of
melancholy
were
ever
afterwards
more
intense
and
politer
biographers
should
not
have
suppressed
the
testimony
that
for
a
time
that
melancholy
seemed
to
his
friends
to
verge
upon
insanity
he
always
found
good
friends
and
as
was
to
happen
again
later
one
of
them
bowline
greene
carried
him
off
to
his
own
secluded
home
and
watched
him
carefully
he
said
the
thought
that
the
snows
and
rains
fell
upon
her
grave
filled
him
with
indescribable
grief
two
years
later
he
told
a
that
although
he
seemed
to
others
to
enjoy
life
rapturously
yet
when
alone
he
was
so
overcome
by
mental
depression
he
never
dared
to
carry
a
later
still
greene
who
had
helped
him
died
and
lincoln
was
to
speak
over
his
grave
for
once
in
his
life
he
broke
down
entirely
the
tears
ran
down
his
yellow
and
shrivelled
cheeks
after
repeated
efforts
he
found
it
impossible
to
speak
and
strode
away
sobbing
the
man
whom
a
grief
of
this
kind
has
affected
not
only
intensely
but
morbidly
is
almost
sure
before
its
influence
has
faded
to
make
love
again
and
is
very
likely
to
do
so
foolishly
miss
mary
owens
was
slightly
older
than
lincoln
she
was
a
handsome
woman
commanding
but
comfortable
in
the
tales
of
lincoln
love
stories
much
else
is
doubtfully
related
but
the
lady
weight
is
in
each
case
stated
with
assurance
and
when
she
visited
her
sister
in
new
salem
in
mary
owens
weighed
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
there
is
nothing
sad
in
her
story
she
was
before
long
happily
married
not
to
lincoln
and
she
long
outlived
him
but
lincoln
who
had
seen
her
on
a
previous
visit
and
partly
remembered
her
had
been
asked
perhaps
in
jest
by
her
sister
to
marry
her
if
she
returned
and
had
rashly
announced
half
in
jest
that
he
would
her
sister
promptly
fetched
her
and
he
lingered
for
some
time
in
a
condition
writing
her
reasonable
conscientious
feeble
letters
in
which
he
put
before
her
dispassionately
the
question
whether
she
could
patiently
bear
to
see
without
sharing
a
lot
of
flourishing
about
in
carriages
to
be
poor
without
the
means
of
hiding
your
poverty
and
assuring
her
that
i
should
be
much
happier
with
you
than
the
way
i
am
provided
i
saw
no
signs
of
discontent
in
you
whether
he
rather
wished
to
marry
her
but
felt
bound
to
hold
her
free
or
distinctly
wished
not
to
marry
her
but
felt
bound
not
to
hold
himself
free
he
probably
was
never
sure
the
lady
very
wisely
decided
that
he
could
not
make
her
happy
and
returned
to
kentucky
she
said
he
was
deficient
in
the
little
courteous
attentions
which
a
woman
happiness
requires
of
her
husband
she
gave
instances
long
after
to
prove
her
point
but
she
always
spoke
of
him
with
friendship
and
respect
as
a
man
with
a
heart
full
of
human
kindness
and
a
head
full
of
common
sense
rather
unluckily
lincoln
upon
his
rejection
or
release
relieved
his
feelings
in
a
letter
about
miss
owens
to
one
of
the
somewhat
older
married
ladies
who
were
kind
to
him
the
wife
of
one
of
his
colleagues
she
ought
to
have
burnt
his
letter
but
she
preserved
it
to
kindle
mild
gossip
after
his
death
it
is
a
burlesque
account
of
his
whole
adventure
describing
with
touches
of
very
bad
taste
his
disillusionment
with
the
now
maturer
charms
of
miss
owens
when
her
sister
brought
her
back
to
new
salem
and
making
comedy
of
his
own
honest
bewilderment
and
his
mingled
relief
and
mortification
when
she
at
last
refused
him
we
may
take
it
as
evidence
of
the
natural
want
of
perception
and
right
instinctive
judgment
in
minor
matters
which
some
who
knew
and
loved
him
attribute
to
him
but
besides
that
the
man
who
found
relief
in
this
exercise
of
humour
was
one
in
whom
the
prospect
of
marriage
caused
some
strange
and
pitiful
perturbation
of
mind
this
was
in
and
a
year
later
mary
todd
came
from
kentucky
to
stay
at
springfield
with
her
ninian
edwards
a
legislator
of
illinois
and
a
close
ally
of
lincoln
she
was
aged
and
her
weight
was
one
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
she
was
well
educated
and
had
family
connections
which
were
highly
esteemed
she
was
pleasant
in
company
but
somewhat
imperious
and
she
was
a
vivacious
talker
when
among
the
young
men
who
now
became
attentive
in
calling
on
the
edwards
lincoln
came
and
sat
awkwardly
gazing
on
miss
todd
edwards
appears
to
have
remarked
that
the
two
were
not
suited
to
each
other
but
an
engagement
took
place
all
the
same
as
to
the
details
of
what
followed
whether
he
or
she
was
the
first
to
have
doubts
and
whether
as
some
say
the
great
stephen
douglas
appeared
on
the
scene
as
a
rival
and
withdrew
rather
generously
but
too
late
is
uncertain
but
lincoln
composed
a
letter
to
break
off
his
engagement
he
showed
it
to
joshua
speed
who
told
him
that
if
he
had
the
courage
of
a
man
he
would
not
write
to
her
but
see
her
and
speak
he
did
so
she
cried
he
kissed
and
tried
to
comfort
her
after
this
speed
had
to
point
out
to
him
that
he
had
really
renewed
his
engagement
again
there
may
be
some
uncertainty
whether
on
january
the
bridal
party
had
actually
assembled
and
the
bridegroom
after
long
search
was
found
by
his
friends
wandering
about
in
a
state
which
made
them
watch
day
and
night
and
keep
knives
from
him
but
it
is
quite
certain
from
his
letters
that
in
some
such
way
on
the
fatal
of
january
he
broke
down
terribly
some
weeks
later
he
wrote
to
his
partner
whether
i
shall
ever
be
better
i
can
not
tell
i
awfully
forebode
i
shall
not
to
remain
as
i
am
is
impossible
i
must
die
or
be
better
as
it
appears
to
me
after
a
while
speed
was
able
to
remove
him
to
his
own
parents
home
in
kentucky
where
he
and
his
mother
nursed
him
back
to
mental
life
then
in
the
course
of
speed
himself
began
to
contemplate
marriage
and
speed
himself
had
painful
searchings
of
heart
and
lincoln
turn
came
to
show
a
sureness
of
perception
in
his
friend
case
that
he
wholly
lacked
in
his
own
i
know
he
writes
what
the
painful
point
with
you
is
it
is
an
apprehension
that
you
do
not
love
her
as
you
should
what
nonsense
how
came
you
to
court
her
but
you
say
you
reasoned
yourself
into
it
what
do
you
mean
by
that
was
it
not
that
you
found
yourself
unable
to
reason
yourself
out
of
it
did
you
not
think
and
partly
form
the
purpose
of
courting
her
the
first
time
you
ever
saw
or
heard
of
her
what
had
reason
to
do
with
it
at
that
early
stage
a
little
later
the
lady
of
speed
love
falls
lincoln
writes
i
hope
and
believe
that
your
present
anxiety
about
her
health
and
her
life
must
and
will
for
ever
banish
those
horrid
doubts
which
i
know
you
sometimes
felt
as
to
the
truth
of
your
affection
for
her
perhaps
this
point
is
no
longer
a
question
with
you
and
my
pertinacious
dwelling
upon
it
is
a
rude
intrusion
upon
your
feelings
if
so
you
must
pardon
me
you
know
the
hell
i
have
suffered
upon
that
point
and
how
tender
i
am
upon
it
when
he
writes
thus
it
is
no
surprise
to
hear
from
him
that
he
has
lost
his
hypochondria
but
it
may
be
that
the
keen
recollection
of
it
gives
him
excessive
anxieties
for
speed
on
the
eve
of
the
wedding
he
writes
you
will
always
hereafter
be
on
ground
that
i
have
never
occupied
and
consequently
if
advice
were
needed
i
might
advise
wrong
i
do
fondly
hope
however
that
you
will
never
need
comfort
from
abroad
i
incline
to
think
it
probable
that
your
nerves
will
occasionally
fail
you
for
a
while
but
once
you
get
them
firmly
graded
now
that
trouble
is
over
for
ever
if
you
went
through
the
ceremony
calmly
or
even
with
sufficient
composure
not
to
excite
alarm
in
any
present
you
are
safe
beyond
question
and
in
two
or
three
months
to
say
the
most
will
be
the
happiest
of
men
soon
he
is
reassured
and
can
feel
somewhat
jealous
of
both
of
you
now
you
will
be
so
exclusively
concerned
with
one
another
that
i
shall
be
forgotten
entirely
i
shall
feel
very
lonesome
without
you
and
a
little
later
it
can
not
be
told
how
it
thrills
me
with
joy
to
hear
you
say
you
are
far
happier
than
you
ever
expected
to
be
i
know
you
too
well
to
suppose
your
expectations
were
not
at
least
sometimes
extravagant
and
if
the
reality
exceeds
them
all
i
say
dear
lord
and
here
follows
what
might
perhaps
have
been
foreseen
your
last
letter
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
the
total
sum
of
all
that
i
have
received
since
the
fatal
of
january
since
then
it
seems
to
me
i
should
have
been
entirely
happy
but
for
the
never
absent
idea
that
there
is
still
one
unhappy
whom
i
have
contributed
to
make
so
that
kills
my
soul
i
can
not
but
reproach
myself
for
even
wishing
to
be
happy
while
she
is
otherwise
very
significantly
he
has
inquired
of
friends
how
that
one
enjoyed
a
trip
on
the
new
railway
cars
to
jacksonville
and
not
being
like
falkland
in
the
rivals
praises
god
that
she
has
enjoyed
it
exceedingly
this
was
in
the
spring
of
some
three
months
later
he
writes
again
to
speed
i
must
gain
confidence
in
my
own
ability
to
keep
my
resolves
when
they
are
made
in
that
ability
i
once
prided
myself
as
the
only
chief
gem
of
my
character
that
gem
i
lost
how
and
where
you
know
too
well
i
have
not
regained
it
and
until
i
do
i
can
not
trust
myself
in
any
matter
of
much
importance
i
believe
now
that
had
you
understood
my
case
at
the
time
as
well
as
i
understood
yours
afterwards
by
the
aid
you
would
have
given
me
i
should
have
sailed
through
clear
i
always
was
superstitious
i
believe
god
made
me
one
of
the
instruments
of
bringing
fanny
and
you
together
which
union
i
have
no
doubt
he
had
whatever
he
designs
for
me
he
will
do
still
and
see
the
salvation
of
the
lord
is
my
text
just
now
if
as
you
say
you
have
told
fanny
all
i
should
have
no
objection
to
her
seeing
this
letter
i
do
not
think
i
can
come
to
kentucky
this
season
i
am
so
poor
and
make
so
little
headway
in
the
world
that
i
drop
back
in
a
month
of
idleness
as
much
as
i
gain
in
a
year
sowing
at
last
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
lincoln
addresses
to
speed
a
question
at
once
so
shrewd
and
so
daringly
intimate
as
perhaps
no
other
man
ever
asked
of
his
friend
the
immense
sufferings
you
endured
from
the
first
days
of
september
till
the
middle
of
february
the
date
of
speed
wedding
you
never
tried
to
conceal
from
me
and
i
well
understood
you
have
now
been
the
husband
of
a
lovely
woman
nearly
eight
months
that
you
are
happier
now
than
the
day
you
married
her
i
well
know
but
i
want
to
ask
a
close
question
you
in
as
well
as
in
glad
you
are
married
as
you
are
from
anybody
but
me
this
would
be
an
impudent
question
not
to
be
tolerated
but
i
know
you
will
pardon
it
in
me
please
answer
it
quickly
as
i
am
impatient
to
know
speed
remained
in
kentucky
lincoln
was
too
poor
for
visits
of
pleasure
and
speed
was
not
a
man
who
cared
for
political
life
but
the
memorials
from
which
the
above
quotations
have
been
taken
of
lincoln
lasting
friendship
with
speed
and
his
kind
mother
who
gave
lincoln
a
treasured
bible
and
his
kind
young
wife
who
made
her
husband
friend
her
own
and
whose
violet
dropped
into
her
letter
to
him
just
as
he
was
sealing
it
was
among
the
few
flowers
that
lincoln
ever
appreciated
throw
the
clearest
light
that
we
can
anywhere
obtain
on
the
inner
mind
of
lincoln
as
may
have
been
foreseen
mary
todd
and
he
had
met
again
on
a
friendly
footing
a
managing
lady
is
credited
with
having
brought
about
a
meeting
between
them
but
evidently
she
did
not
do
it
till
lincoln
was
at
least
getting
desirous
to
be
managed
he
was
much
absorbed
at
this
time
in
law
business
to
which
since
his
breakdown
he
had
applied
himself
more
seriously
it
was
at
this
period
too
that
his
notable
address
on
temperance
was
given
soon
after
his
meetings
with
miss
todd
began
again
he
involved
himself
in
a
complication
of
a
different
kind
he
had
written
partly
it
seems
for
the
young
amusement
some
innocent
if
uninteresting
political
skits
relating
to
some
question
about
taxes
this
brought
on
him
an
unexpected
challenge
from
a
fiery
but
diminutive
revenue
official
one
colonel
shields
a
prominent
democratic
politician
lincoln
availed
himself
of
the
right
of
the
challenged
to
impose
ridiculous
conditions
of
combat
partly
no
doubt
in
fun
but
with
the
sensible
object
also
of
making
sure
that
he
could
disarm
his
antagonist
with
no
risk
of
harm
to
the
little
man
the
tangled
controversy
which
ensued
as
to
how
and
by
whose
fault
the
duel
eventually
fell
through
has
nothing
in
it
now
but
the
whole
undignified
business
seems
to
have
given
lincoln
lasting
chagrin
and
worried
him
greatly
at
a
time
when
it
would
have
been
well
that
he
should
be
cheerful
at
last
on
november
when
lincoln
was
nearly
he
was
safely
married
the
wedding
held
according
to
the
prevailing
custom
in
a
private
house
was
an
important
function
for
it
was
the
first
episcopalian
wedding
that
good
society
in
springfield
had
witnessed
malicious
fortune
brought
in
a
ludicrous
incident
at
the
last
moment
for
when
in
the
lawyerlike
verbiage
of
the
then
american
the
bridegroom
said
with
this
ring
i
thee
endow
with
all
my
goods
chattels
lands
and
tenements
old
judge
brown
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
who
had
never
heard
the
like
impatiently
broke
in
god
almighty
lincoln
the
statute
fixes
all
that
there
is
more
than
the
conventional
reason
for
apology
for
pressing
the
subject
a
little
further
nothing
very
illuminating
can
be
said
as
to
the
course
of
lincoln
married
life
but
much
has
already
been
made
public
about
it
which
though
it
can
not
be
taken
as
reaching
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
not
properly
to
be
dismissed
as
mere
gossip
lincoln
it
is
clear
had
a
high
temper
the
fact
that
poor
woman
after
her
husband
had
been
murdered
by
her
side
she
developed
clear
symptoms
of
insanity
may
or
may
not
for
all
we
are
entitled
to
know
be
relevant
in
this
regard
she
was
much
younger
than
her
husband
and
had
gone
through
a
cruel
experience
for
him
moreover
she
had
proper
ambitions
and
was
accustomed
to
proper
conventional
refinements
so
her
husband
exterior
roughness
tried
her
sorely
not
the
less
we
may
be
sure
because
of
her
real
pride
in
him
wife
and
tailor
combined
could
not
with
any
amount
of
money
have
dressed
him
well
once
though
they
kept
a
servant
then
lincoln
thought
it
friendly
to
open
the
door
himself
in
his
shirt
sleeves
when
two
most
elegant
ladies
came
to
call
on
such
occasions
and
doubtless
on
other
occasions
of
less
provocation
lincoln
high
temper
was
let
loose
it
seems
pretty
certain
too
that
he
met
her
with
mere
forbearance
sad
patience
and
avoidance
of
conflict
his
fellow
lawyers
came
to
notice
that
he
stayed
away
from
home
on
circuit
when
all
the
rest
of
them
could
go
home
for
a
day
or
two
fifteen
years
after
his
wedding
he
himself
confessed
to
his
trouble
not
disloyally
but
in
a
rather
moving
remonstrance
with
some
one
who
had
felt
intolerably
provoked
by
lincoln
there
are
slight
indications
that
occasions
of
difficulty
and
pain
to
lincoln
happened
up
to
the
end
of
his
life
on
the
other
hand
there
are
slight
indications
that
common
love
for
their
children
helped
to
make
the
two
happier
and
there
are
no
indications
at
all
of
any
approach
to
a
serious
quarrel
all
that
is
told
us
may
be
perfectly
true
and
not
by
any
means
have
justified
the
pity
that
some
of
lincoln
friends
were
ready
to
feel
for
him
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
suspecting
that
lincoln
wife
did
not
duly
like
his
partner
and
biographer
herndon
who
felt
it
his
duty
to
record
so
many
painful
facts
and
his
own
possibly
too
painful
impression
from
them
on
the
other
side
herndon
makes
it
clear
that
in
some
respects
lincoln
was
an
admirable
wife
for
her
husband
she
faced
the
difficulties
of
their
poverty
with
spirit
and
resolution
testimony
from
other
sources
to
her
graceful
hospitality
abounds
more
than
this
from
the
very
first
she
believed
in
his
powers
it
seems
she
had
the
discernment
to
know
when
few
others
can
have
done
so
how
far
greater
he
was
than
his
rival
douglas
it
was
herndon
belief
in
days
when
he
and
lincoln
were
the
two
persons
who
saw
most
of
him
that
she
sustained
his
just
ambition
and
that
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
his
personal
career
she
had
the
courage
to
make
him
refuse
an
attractive
appointment
which
must
have
ruined
it
the
worst
that
we
are
told
with
any
certainty
amounts
to
this
that
like
the
very
happily
married
writer
of
virginibus
puerisque
lincoln
discovered
that
marriage
is
a
field
of
battle
and
not
a
bed
of
roses
a
battle
in
which
we
are
forced
to
suspect
that
he
did
not
play
his
full
part
we
should
perhaps
be
right
in
associating
his
curious
record
of
right
and
high
regard
for
women
and
inefficiency
where
a
particular
happiness
depended
on
him
with
the
belief
in
woman
suffrage
which
he
early
adopted
and
probably
retained
be
that
as
it
may
this
part
of
his
story
points
to
something
which
runs
through
his
whole
character
something
which
perhaps
may
be
expressed
by
saying
that
the
natural
bias
of
his
qualities
was
towards
the
negative
side
we
hear
no
doubt
of
occasions
when
his
vigour
was
instant
and
terrible
like
that
of
hamlet
on
the
ship
for
england
but
these
were
occasions
when
the
right
or
the
necessity
of
the
case
was
obvious
we
have
seen
him
also
firm
and
absolutely
independent
where
his
conviction
had
already
been
thought
out
where
there
was
room
for
further
reflection
for
patiently
waiting
on
events
or
for
taking
counsel
of
wise
friends
manly
decision
had
not
come
easily
to
him
he
had
let
a
third
person
almost
engage
him
to
miss
owens
once
in
this
relation
to
her
he
had
let
it
be
the
woman
part
and
not
the
man
to
have
decision
enough
for
the
two
speed
had
to
tell
him
that
he
must
face
miss
todd
and
speak
to
her
and
speed
again
had
to
make
clear
to
him
what
the
effect
of
his
speaking
had
been
in
time
he
decided
what
he
thought
his
own
feelings
were
but
it
was
by
inference
from
the
feelings
of
speed
lastly
it
seems
the
troubles
of
his
married
life
were
met
by
mere
patience
and
avoidance
all
this
of
course
concerned
a
side
of
life
affairs
in
regard
to
which
his
mind
had
suffered
painful
shocks
but
it
shows
the
direction
of
his
possible
weakness
and
his
possible
strength
in
other
things
it
falls
in
with
a
trait
which
he
himself
noted
in
one
of
the
letters
to
speed
i
have
no
doubt
he
writes
it
is
the
peculiar
misfortune
of
both
you
and
me
to
dream
dreams
of
elysium
far
exceeding
all
that
anything
earthly
can
realise
all
such
men
have
to
go
through
deep
waters
but
they
do
not
necessarily
miss
either
success
or
happiness
in
the
end
lincoln
life
may
be
said
to
have
tested
him
by
the
test
which
kipling
states
in
his
lines
about
washington
if
you
can
dream
and
not
make
dreams
your
master
if
you
can
think
and
not
make
thoughts
your
aim
he
was
to
prove
that
he
could
do
this
it
is
for
the
following
pages
to
show
in
how
high
a
degree
meanwhile
one
thing
should
already
be
clear
about
him
no
shrewd
judge
of
men
could
read
his
letters
to
speed
with
care
and
not
feel
that
whatever
mistakes
this
man
might
commit
fundamentally
he
was
worthy
of
entire
trust
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
what
to
the
end
of
his
life
speed
and
all
the
men
who
knew
him
and
an
ever
widening
circle
of
men
who
had
to
judge
by
more
casual
impressions
did
feel
about
lincoln
whatever
was
questionable
in
his
private
or
public
acts
his
own
explanation
if
he
happened
to
give
one
would
be
taken
by
them
as
the
full
and
naked
truth
and
if
there
was
no
known
explanation
it
remained
to
them
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
his
main
intention
was
right
chapter
iv
lincoln
in
congress
and
in
retirement
mexican
war
and
lincoln
work
in
lincoln
had
ceased
before
his
marriage
to
sit
in
the
illinois
legislature
he
had
won
sufficient
standing
for
his
ambition
to
aim
higher
a
former
law
partner
of
his
was
now
in
congress
and
he
wished
to
follow
but
he
had
to
submit
to
a
few
years
delay
of
which
the
story
is
curious
and
honourable
his
rivals
for
the
representation
of
his
own
constituency
were
two
fellow
whigs
baker
and
hardin
both
of
whom
afterwards
bore
distinguished
parts
in
the
mexican
war
and
with
both
of
whom
he
was
friendly
somewhat
to
his
disgust
at
a
party
gathering
in
his
own
county
in
baker
was
preferred
to
him
a
letter
of
his
gives
a
shrewd
account
of
the
manoeuvres
among
members
of
various
churches
which
brought
this
about
it
is
curiously
careful
not
to
overstate
the
effect
of
these
influences
and
characteristically
denies
that
baker
had
part
in
them
to
make
the
thing
harder
he
was
sent
from
this
meeting
to
a
convention
for
the
whole
constituency
with
which
the
nomination
lay
and
his
duty
of
course
was
to
work
for
baker
here
it
became
obvious
that
hardin
would
be
chosen
nothing
could
be
done
for
baker
at
that
time
but
lincoln
being
against
his
will
there
in
baker
interests
took
an
opportunity
in
the
bargaining
that
took
place
to
advance
baker
claim
to
the
detriment
of
his
own
to
be
hardin
successor
two
years
later
by
some
perverse
accident
notes
about
details
of
party
management
fill
a
disproportionate
space
among
those
letters
of
lincoln
which
have
been
preserved
but
these
reveal
that
with
all
his
attention
to
the
affairs
of
his
very
proper
ambition
he
was
able
throughout
to
illuminate
dull
matters
of
this
order
with
action
of
singular
disinterestedness
after
being
a
second
time
postponed
no
doubt
to
the
advantage
of
his
law
business
he
took
his
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
for
two
years
in
the
spring
of
two
short
sessions
can
hardly
suffice
for
mastering
the
very
complicated
business
of
that
body
he
made
hardly
any
mark
he
probably
learned
much
and
was
able
to
study
at
leisure
the
characters
of
his
brother
politicians
he
earned
the
valuable
esteem
of
some
and
seems
to
have
passed
as
a
very
pleasant
honest
plain
specimen
of
the
rough
west
like
others
of
the
younger
congressmen
he
had
the
privilege
of
breakfasting
with
webster
his
brief
career
in
the
house
seems
to
have
disappointed
him
and
it
certainly
dissatisfied
his
constituents
the
part
that
he
played
may
impress
us
more
favourably
than
it
did
them
but
slight
as
it
was
it
requires
a
historical
explanation
mexico
had
detached
itself
from
spain
in
and
in
the
province
of
texas
detached
itself
from
mexico
texas
was
largely
peopled
by
immigrants
from
the
states
and
these
had
grievances
one
of
them
was
that
mexico
abolished
slavery
but
there
was
real
misgovernment
as
well
and
among
other
cruel
incidents
of
the
rebellion
which
followed
the
massacre
of
rebels
at
the
alamo
stamped
itself
on
american
memory
the
republic
of
texas
began
to
seek
annexation
to
the
united
states
in
but
there
was
opposition
in
the
states
and
there
were
difficulties
with
mexico
and
other
governments
at
last
in
at
the
very
close
of
his
term
of
office
president
tyler
got
the
annexation
pushed
through
in
defiance
of
the
whigs
who
made
him
president
mexico
broke
off
diplomatic
relations
but
peace
could
no
doubt
have
been
preserved
if
peace
had
been
any
object
with
the
new
president
polk
or
with
the
southern
leaders
whose
views
he
represented
they
had
set
their
eyes
upon
a
further
acquisition
larger
even
than
texas
california
and
the
whole
of
the
territories
still
belonging
to
mexico
to
the
east
of
it
it
is
not
contested
and
would
not
have
been
contested
then
that
the
motive
of
their
policy
was
the
southern
desire
to
win
further
soil
for
cultivation
by
slaves
but
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
gaining
some
popularity
for
their
designs
in
the
north
talk
about
our
manifest
destiny
to
reach
the
pacific
may
have
been
justly
described
by
parson
wilbur
as
half
on
it
and
half
rum
but
it
is
easy
to
see
how
readily
it
might
be
taken
up
and
indeed
many
northerners
at
that
moment
had
a
fancy
of
their
own
for
expansion
in
the
and
were
not
pleased
with
polk
when
in
he
set
the
final
seal
upon
the
settlement
with
great
britain
of
the
oregon
frontier
when
he
did
this
polk
had
already
brought
about
his
own
war
the
judgment
on
that
war
expressed
at
the
time
in
the
first
biglow
papers
has
seldom
been
questioned
since
and
there
seldom
can
have
been
a
war
so
sternly
condemned
by
soldiers
grant
amongst
others
who
fought
in
it
gallantly
the
facts
seem
to
have
been
just
as
lincoln
afterwards
recited
them
in
congress
the
rio
grande
which
looks
a
reasonable
frontier
on
a
map
was
claimed
by
the
united
states
as
the
frontier
of
texas
the
territory
occupied
by
the
american
settlers
of
texas
reached
admittedly
up
to
and
beyond
the
river
nueces
east
of
the
rio

was
allowed
no

in

matter
to
march
troops
right
up

position
commanding

encampment
of

soldiers

had
thus
begun

war
polk
could
thus
allege
his
duty
to
prosecute
it
when
the
whole
transaction
was
afterwards
assailed
his
critics
might
be
tempted
to
go
or
represented
as
going
upon
the
false
ground
that
only
congress
can
constitutionally
declare
war
that
is
of
course
sanction
purely
offensive
operations
long
however
before
the
dispute
could
come
to
a
head
the
brilliant
successes
of
general
taylor
and
still
more
of
general
scott
with
a
few
trained
troops
against
large
undisciplined
numbers
put
all
criticism
at
a
disadvantage
the
city
of
mexico
was
occupied
by
scott
in
september
and
peace
with
the
cession
of
the
vast
domain
that
had
been
coveted
was
concluded
in
may
war
having
begun
the
line
of
the
whig
opposition
was
to
vote
supplies
and
protest
as
best
they
might
against
the
language
endorsing
policy
which
in
the
pettiest
spirit
of
political
manoeuvre
was
sometimes
incorporated
in
the
votes
in
this
lincoln
steadily
supported
them
one
of
his
only
two
speeches
of
any
length
in
congress
was
made
on
the
occasion
of
a
vote
of
this
kind
in
the
subject
was
by
that
time
so
stale
that
his
speech
could
hardly
make
much
impression
but
it
appears
an
extraordinarily
clear
strong
upright
presentment
of
the
complex
and
unpopular
case
against
the
war
his
other
long
speech
is
elevated
above
buffoonery
by
a
brief
cogent
and
earnest
passage
on
the
same
theme
but
it
was
a
frank
piece
of
clowning
on
a
licensed
occasion
it
was
the
fashion
for
the
house
when
its
own
dissolution
and
a
presidential
election
were
both
imminent
to
have
a
sort
of
rhetorical
scrimmage
in
which
members
on
both
sides
spoke
for
the
edification
of
their
own
constituencies
and
that
of
buncombe
the
whigs
were
now
happy
in
having
diverted
the
against
the
democrats
by
running
for
the
presidency
general
taylor
a
good
soldier
who
did
not
know
whether
he
was
a
whig
or
a
democrat
but
who
besides
being
a
hero
of
the
war
was
inoffensive
to
the
south
for
he
lived
in
louisiana
and
had
slaves
of
his
own
it
is
characteristic
of
the
time
that
the
democrats
in
whose
counsels
the
southern
men
prevailed
now
began
a
practice
of
choosing
northern
candidates
and
nominated
general
cass
of
michigan
whose
distinction
had
not
been
won
in
war
the
democratic
congressmen
in
this
debate
made
game
of
the
whigs
with
their
and
seem
to
have
carried
a
crude
manner
of
pleasantry
pretty
far
when
lincoln
determined
to
show
them
that
they
could
be
beaten
at
that
game
he
seems
to
have
succeeded
admirably
with
a
burlesque
comparison
too
long
to
quote
of
general
martial
exploits
with
his
own
and
other
matter
enhanced
by
the
most
extravagant
western
manner
and
delivery
anyone
who
reads
much
of
the
always
grave
and
sometimes
most
moving
orations
of
lincoln
later
years
may
do
well
to
turn
back
to
this
agreeable
piece
of
but
he
should
then
turn
a
few
pages
further
back
to
lincoln
little
bill
for
the
gradual
and
compensated
extinction
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
washington
stands
he
introduced
this
of
his
own
motion
without
encouragement
from
abolitionist
or
accompanying
it
with
a
brief
statement
that
he
had
carefully
ascertained
that
the
representative
people
of
the
district
privately
approved
of
it
but
had
no
right
to
commit
them
to
public
support
of
it
it
perished
of
course
with
the
views
which
he
had
long
formed
and
continued
to
hold
about
slavery
very
few
opportunities
could
in
these
years
come
to
him
of
proper
and
useful
action
against
it
he
seized
upon
these
opportunities
not
less
because
in
doing
so
he
had
to
stand
alone
his
career
as
a
congressman
was
soon
over
there
was
no
movement
to
him
and
the
whigs
now
lost
his
constituency
his
speeches
and
his
votes
against
the
mexican
war
offended
his
friends
even
his
partner
the
abolitionist
herndon
whose
further
acquaintance
we
have
to
make
was
too
much
infected
with
the
popularity
of
a
successful
war
to
understand
lincoln
plain
position
or
to
approve
of
his
giving
votes
which
might
seem
unpatriotic
lincoln
wrote
back
to
him
firmly
but
sadly
persuaded
as
he
was
that
political
action
in
advance
of
public
sentiment
was
idle
resigned
and
hardened
as
we
might
easily
think
him
to
many
of
the
necessities
of
party
discipline
it
evidently
caused
him
naïve
surprise
that
when
he
was
called
upon
for
a
definite
opinion
anybody
should
expect
him
as
he
candidly
puts
it
to
tell
a
lie
as
a
retiring
congressman
he
was
invited
to
speak
in
several
places
in
the
east
on
behalf
of
taylor
candidature
and
after
taylor
election
claimed
his
right
as
the
proper
person
to
be
consulted
with
certain
others
about
government
appointments
in
illinois
taylor
carried
out
the
spoils
system
with
conscientious
thoroughness
as
he
touchingly
said
he
had
thought
over
the
question
from
a
soldier
point
of
view
and
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
while
he
as
their
chief
enjoyed
the
presidency
the
private
soldiers
in
the
whig
ranks
should
not
get
whatever
was
going
lincoln
attitude
in
the
matter
may
be
of
interest
to
take
an
example
he
writes
to
the
president
about
the
postmastership
in
some
place
that
he
does
not
know
whether
the
president
desires
to
change
the
tenure
of
such
offices
on
party
grounds
and
offers
no
advice
that
a
is
a
whig
whose
appointment
is
much
desired
by
the
local
whigs
and
a
most
respectable
man
that
b
also
a
whig
would
in
lincoln
judgment
be
a
somewhat
better
but
not
so
popular
subject
for
appointment
that
c
the
present
postmaster
is
a
democrat
but
is
on
every
ground
save
his
political
party
a
proper
person
for
the
office
there
was
an
office
which
he
himself
desired
it
was
that
of
commissioner
of
the
general
land
office
a
new
office
in
washington
dealing
with
settlement
on
government
lands
in
the
west
he
was
probably
well
suited
to
it
but
his
application
was
delayed
by
the
fact
that
friends
in
illinois
wanted
the
post
too
a
certain
butterfield
a
lawyer
renowned
for
his
jokes
which
showed
it
is
said
at
least
a
humorous
intention
got
it
and
then
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
disappointed
lincoln
to
have
to
defend
butterfield
against
some
unfair
attack
but
a
tempting
offer
was
made
him
that
of
the
governorship
of
oregon
territory
and
he
wavered
before
refusing
to
take
work
which
would
as
it
happened
have
kept
him
far
away
when
the
opportunity
of
his
life
came
it
was
lincoln
who
would
not
let
him
cut
himself
off
so
completely
from
politics
as
for
himself
it
is
hard
to
resist
the
impression
that
he
was
at
this
time
a
tired
man
disappointed
as
to
the
progress
of
his
career
and
probably
also
disappointed
and
somewhat
despondent
about
politics
and
the
possibilities
of
good
service
that
lay
open
to
politicians
it
may
be
that
this
was
partly
the
reason
why
he
was
not
at
all
aroused
by
the
crisis
in
american
politics
which
must
now
be
related
and
the
compromise
of
it
has
been
said
that
the
motive
for
the
conquests
from
mexico
was
the
desire
for
slave
territory
the
attractive
part
of
the
new
dominion
was
of
course
california
arizona
and
new
mexico
are
arid
regions
and
the
mineral
wealth
of
nevada
was
unknown
the
peacefully
acquired
region
of
oregon
far
north
need
not
concern
us
but
oregon
became
a
free
state
in
early
in
the
war
a
struggle
began
between
northerners
and
southerners
to
a
large
extent
independent
of
party
in
the
senate
and
the
house
as
to
whether
slavery
should
be
allowed
in
the
conquered
land
or
not
david
wilmot
a
northern
democratic
congressman
proposed
a
proviso
to
the
very
first
money
grant
connected
with
the
war
that
slavery
should
be
forbidden
in
any
territory
to
be
annexed
the
wilmot
proviso
was
proposed
again
on
every
possible
occasion
lincoln
by
the
way
sturdily
supported
it
while
in
congress
it
was
always
voted
down
cass
proposed
as
a
solution
of
all
difficulties
that
the
question
of
slavery
should
be
left
to
the
people
of
the
new
territories
or
states
themselves
the
american
public
apt
as
condensing
an
argument
into
a
phrase
dismissed
cass
principle
for
the
time
being
with
the
epithet
squatter
sovereignty
calhoun
and
his
friends
said
it
was
contrary
to
the
constitution
that
an
american
citizen
should
not
be
free
to
move
with
his
property
including
his
slaves
into
territory
won
by
the
union
the
annexation
was
carried
out
and
the
question
of
slavery
was
unsettled
then
events
took
a
surprising
turn
in
the
winter
of
gold
was
discovered
in
california
throughout
came
pouring
in
from
every
part
of
the
world
this
miscellaneous
new
people
whose
rough
ways
have
been
more
celebrated
in
literature
than
those
of
any
similar
crowd
lived
at
first
in
considerable
anarchy
but
they
determined
without
delay
to
set
up
some
regular
system
of
government
in
the
course
of
they
elected
a
convention
to
draw
up
a
state
constitution
and
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
states
the
convention
unanimously
made
the
prohibition
of
slavery
part
of
that
constitution
there
was
no
likelihood
that
with
a
further
influx
of
settlers
of
the
same
sort
this
decision
of
california
would
alter
was
california
to
be
admitted
as
a
state
with
this
constitution
of
its
own
choice
which
the
bulk
of
the
people
of
america
approved
to
politicians
of
the
school
now
fully
developed
in
the
south
there
seemed
nothing
outrageous
in
saying
that
it
should
be
refused
admission
to
them
calhoun
argument
which
regarded
a
slave
as
his
chattel
in
the
same
sense
as
his
hat
or
seemed
the
ripe
fruit
of
logic
it
did
not
shock
them
in
the
least
that
they
were
forcing
the
slave
system
on
an
unwilling
community
for
were
not
the
northerners
prepared
to
force
the
free
system
a
prominent
southern
senator
talking
with
a
northern
colleague
a
little
later
said
triumphantly
i
see
how
it
is
you
may
force
freedom
as
much
as
you
like
but
we
are
to
beware
how
we
force
slavery
and
was
surprised
that
the
northerner
cheerfully
accepted
this
position
it
is
necessary
to
remember
throughout
the
following
years
that
whatever
ordinary
southerners
thought
in
private
their
whole
political
action
was
now
based
on
the
assumption
that
slavery
as
it
was
was
an
institution
which
no
reasonable
man
could
think
wrong
zachary
taylor
unlike
harrison
the
previous
hero
of
the
whigs
survived
his
inauguration
by
sixteen
months
he
was
no
politician
at
all
but
placed
in
the
position
of
president
for
which
fairness
and
firmness
were
really
the
greatest
qualifications
he
was
man
enough
to
rely
on
his
own
good
sense
he
had
come
to
washington
under
the
impression
that
the
disputes
which
raged
there
were
due
to
the
aggressiveness
of
the
north
a
very
little
time
there
convinced
him
of
the
contrary
as
he
was
the
claim
of
the
south
to
force
slavery
on
california
struck
him
as
an
arrogant
pretension
and
so
far
as
matters
rested
with
him
he
was
simply
not
to
be
moved
by
it
he
sent
a
message
to
congress
advising
the
admission
of
california
with
the
constitution
of
its
own
choice
when
as
we
shall
shortly
see
the
great
men
of
the
senate
thought
the
case
demanded
conciliation
and
a
great
scheme
of
compromise
he
resolutely
disagreed
he
used
the
whole
of
his
influence
against
their
compromise
and
it
is
believed
with
good
reason
that
he
would
have
put
his
veto
as
president
on
the
chief
measure
in
which
the
compromise
issued
if
he
had
lived
to
carry
out
his
policy
it
seems
possible
that
there
would
have
been
an
attempt
to
execute
the
threats
of
secession
which
were
muttered
this
time
in
virginia
but
it
is
almost
certain
that
at
that
time
and
with
the
position
which
he
occupied
he
would
have
been
able
to
quell
the
movement
at
once
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
taylor
was
a
man
of
any
unusual
gifts
of
intellect
but
he
had
what
we
may
call
character
and
it
was
the
one
thing
wanting
in
political
life
at
the
time
the
greatest
minds
in
american
politics
as
we
shall
see
viewed
the
occasion
otherwise
but
in
the
light
of
what
followed
it
seems
a
signal
and
irreparable
error
that
when
the
spirit
of
aggression
rising
in
the
south
had
taken
definite
shape
in
a
demand
which
was
manifestly
wrongful
it
was
bought
off
and
not
met
with
a
straightforward
refusal
taylor
died
in
the
course
of
and
millard
fillmore
of
new
york
succeeded
him
fillmore
had
an
appearance
of
grave
and
benign
wisdom
which
led
a
frenchman
to
describe
him
as
the
ideal
ruler
of
a
republic
but
he
was
a
pattern
of
that
outwardly
dignified
yet
nerveless
and
heartless
respectability
which
was
more
dangerous
to
america
at
that
period
than
political
recklessness
or
want
of
scruple
the
actual
issue
of
the
crisis
was
that
the
admission
of
california
was
bought
from
the
south
by
large
concessions
in
other
directions
this
was
the
proposal
of
henry
clay
who
was
now
an
old
man
anxious
for
the
union
but
had
been
a
lover
of
such
compromises
ever
since
he
promoted
the
missouri
compromise
thirty
years
ago
but
to
the
savage
indignation
of
some
of
his
boston
admirers
webster
used
the
whole
force
of
his
influence
and
debating
power
in
support
of
clay
the
chief
concessions
made
to
the
south
were
two
in
the
first
place
territorial
governments
were
set
up
in
new
mexico
and
utah
since
then
the
home
of
the
mormons
without
any
restriction
on
slavery
this
concession
was
defended
in
the
north
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
sham
because
the
physical
character
of
those
regions
made
successful
slave
plantations
impossible
there
but
it
was
of
course
a
surrender
of
the
principle
which
had
been
struggled
for
in
the
wilmot
proviso
during
the
last
four
years
and
the
southern
leaders
showed
the
clearness
of
their
limited
vision
by
valuing
it
just
upon
that
ground
there
had
been
reason
for
the
territorial
concessions
to
slavery
in
the
past
generation
because
it
was
established
in
the
territories
concerned
but
there
was
no
such
reason
now
the
second
concession
was
that
of
a
new
federal
law
to
ensure
the
return
of
fugitive
slaves
from
the
free
states
the
demand
for
this
was
partly
factitious
for
the
states
in
the
far
south
which
were
not
exposed
to
loss
of
slaves
were
the
most
insistent
on
it
and
it
would
appear
that
the
southern
leaders
felt
it
politic
to
force
the
acceptance
of
the
measure
in
a
form
which
would
humiliate
their
opponents
there
is
no
escape
from
the
contention
which
lincoln
especially
admitted
without
reserve
that
the
enactment
of
an
effective
act
of
this
sort
was
if
demanded
due
under
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
but
the
measure
actually
passed
was
manifestly
defiant
of
all
principles
of
justice
it
was
so
framed
as
almost
to
destroy
the
chance
which
a
lawfully
free
negro
might
have
of
proving
his
freedom
if
arrested
by
the
professional
as
a
runaway
it
was
the
sort
of
act
which
a
president
should
have
vetoed
as
a
fraud
upon
the
constitution
thus
over
and
above
the
objection
now
plain
to
any
compromise
the
actual
compromise
proposed
was
marked
by
flagrant
wrong
but
it
was
put
through
by
the
weight
of
webster
and
clay
this
event
marks
the
close
of
a
period
it
was
the
last
achievement
of
webster
and
clay
both
of
whom
passed
away
in
in
the
hope
that
they
had
permanently
pacified
the
union
calhoun
their
great
contemporary
had
already
died
in
gloomily
presaging
and
lamenting
the
coming
danger
to
the
union
which
was
so
largely
his
own
creation
for
a
while
the
cheerful
view
of
webster
and
clay
seemed
better
justified
there
had
been
angry
protest
in
the
north
against
the
fugitive
slave
law
there
was
some
forcible
resistance
to
arrests
of
negroes
and
some
states
passed
protection
of
liberty
acts
of
their
own
to
impede
the
federal
law
in
its
working
but
the
excitement
which
had
flared
up
suddenly
died
down
as
suddenly
in
the
presidential
election
of
northerners
generally
reflected
that
they
wanted
quiet
and
had
an
instinct
curiously
falsified
that
the
democratic
party
was
the
more
likely
to
give
it
them
the
whigs
again
proposed
a
hero
general
scott
a
greater
soldier
than
taylor
but
a
vainer
man
who
mistakenly
broke
with
all
precedent
and
went
upon
the
stump
for
himself
the
president
who
was
elected
franklin
pierce
of
new
hampshire
a
friend
of
hawthorne
might
perhaps
claim
the
palm
among
the
presidents
of
those
days
for
sheer
deleterious
insignificance
the
favourite
observation
of
his
contemporaries
upon
him
was
that
he
was
a
gentleman
but
his
convivial
nature
made
the
social
attractiveness
of
southern
circles
in
washington
overpowering
to
any
brain
or
character
that
he
may
have
possessed
a
new
generation
of
political
personages
now
came
to
the
front
jefferson
davis
of
mississippi
a
man
of
force
and
considerable
dignity
began
to
take
the
leading
part
in
the
powerful
group
of
southern
senators
stephen
douglas
of
illinois
rapidly
became
the
foremost
man
of
the
democratic
party
generally
william
seward
late
governor
of
new
york
and
salmon
chase
a
democrat
late
governor
of
ohio
had
played
a
manful
part
in
the
senate
in
opposition
to
webster
and
clay
and
their
compromise
from
this
time
on
we
must
look
on
these
two
joined
a
little
later
by
charles
sumner
of
massachusetts
as
the
obvious
leaders
in
the
struggle
against
slavery
which
was
shortly
to
be
renewed
and
in
which
lincoln
part
seemed
likely
to
remain
a
humble
one
in
whether
seward
and
chase
and
the
other
opponents
of
the
compromise
were
right
as
it
now
seems
they
were
or
not
lincoln
was
not
the
man
who
in
the
crisis
of
would
have
been
likely
to
make
an
insurrectionary
stand
against
his
old
clay
and
the
revered
constitutional
authority
of
webster
he
had
indeed
little
opportunity
to
do
so
in
illinois
but
his
one
recorded
speech
of
this
period
an
oration
to
a
meeting
of
both
parties
on
the
death
of
clay
in
expresses
approval
of
the
compromise
this
speech
which
is
significant
of
the
trend
of
his
thoughts
at
this
time
does
not
lend
itself
to
brief
extracts
because
it
is
wanting
in
the
frankness
of
his
speeches
before
and
after
a
harsh
reference
to
abolitionists
serves
to
disguise
the
fact
that
the
whole
speech
is
animated
by
antagonism
to
slavery
the
occasion
and
the
subject
are
used
with
rather
disagreeable
subtlety
to
insinuate
opposition
to
slavery
into
the
minds
of
a
cautious
audience
the
speaker
himself
seems
satisfied
with
the
mood
of
mere
compromise
which
had
governed
clay
in
this
matter
or
rather
perhaps
he
is
twisting
clay
attitude
into
one
of
more
consistent
opposition
to
slavery
than
he
really
showed
in
any
case
we
can
be
quite
sure
that
the
moderate
and
subtle
but
intensely
firm
opinion
with
which
a
little
later
lincoln
returned
to
political
strife
was
the
product
of
long
and
deep
and
anxious
thought
during
the
years
from
to
on
the
surface
it
did
not
go
far
beyond
the
condemnation
of
slavery
and
acceptance
of
the
constitution
which
had
guided
him
earlier
nor
did
it
seem
to
differ
from
the
public
opinion
which
in
created
a
new
party
but
there
was
this
difference
that
lincoln
had
by
then
looked
at
the
matter
in
all
its
bearings
and
prepared
his
mind
for
all
eventualities
we
shall
find
and
need
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
he
who
now
hung
back
a
little
and
who
later
moved
when
public
opinion
moved
later
still
continued
to
move
when
public
opinion
had
receded
what
we
know
of
these
years
of
private
life
is
mainly
due
to
william
herndon
the
young
lawyer
already
quoted
whom
he
took
into
partnership
in
and
who
kept
on
the
business
of
the
firm
in
springfield
till
lincoln
death
this
gentleman
was
like
boswell
of
opinion
that
a
great
man
is
not
best
portrayed
as
a
figure
in
a
window
he
had
lived
with
lincoln
groaned
under
his
odd
ways
and
loved
them
for
sixteen
years
before
his
presidency
and
after
his
death
he
devoted
much
research
in
his
own
memory
and
those
of
many
others
to
the
task
of
substituting
for
lincoln
aureole
the
battered
tall
hat
with
valuable
papers
stuck
in
its
lining
which
he
had
long
contemplated
with
reverent
irritation
herndon
was
not
endowed
with
boswell
artistic
gift
for
putting
his
materials
together
perhaps
because
he
lacked
that
delicacy
and
sureness
of
moral
perception
which
more
than
redeemed
boswell
absurdities
he
succeeded
on
the
whole
in
his
aim
for
the
figure
that
more
or
less
distinctly
emerges
from
the
litter
of
his
workshop
is
lovable
but
in
spite
of
all
lincoln
melancholy
the
dreariness
of
his
life
sitting
with
his
feet
on
the
table
in
his
unswept
and
untidy
office
at
illinois
or
riding
on
circuit
or
staying
at
ramshackle
western
inns
with
the
illinois
bar
can
not
have
been
so
unrelieved
as
it
is
in
herndon
presentation
and
herndon
overdid
his
part
he
ferreted
out
petty
incidents
which
he
thought
might
display
the
acute
lincoln
as
slightly
too
acute
when
for
all
that
can
be
seen
lincoln
acted
just
as
any
sensible
man
would
have
acted
but
the
result
is
that
in
this
part
of
his
life
especially
lincoln
way
of
living
was
subjected
to
so
close
a
scrutiny
as
few
men
have
undergone
herndon
scrutiny
does
not
reveal
the
current
of
his
thoughts
either
on
life
generally
or
on
the
political
problem
which
hereafter
was
to
absorb
him
it
shows
on
the
contrary
and
the
recollections
of
his
presidency
confirm
it
that
his
thought
on
any
important
topic
though
it
might
flash
out
without
disguise
in
rare
moments
of
intimacy
usually
remained
long
unexpressed
his
great
sociability
had
perhaps
even
then
a
rather
formidable
side
to
it
he
was
not
merely
amusing
himself
and
other
people
when
he
chatted
and
exchanged
anecdotes
far
into
the
night
there
was
an
element
not
ungenial
of
purposeful
study
in
it
all
he
was
building
up
his
knowledge
of
ordinary
human
nature
his
insight
into
popular
feeling
his
rather
slow
but
sure
comprehension
of
the
individual
men
whom
he
did
know
it
astonished
the
young
herndon
that
the
serious
books
he
read
were
few
and
that
he
seldom
seemed
to
read
the
whole
of
them
though
with
the
bible
shakespeare
and
to
a
less
extent
burns
he
saturated
his
mind
the
few
books
and
the
great
many
men
were
part
of
one
study
in
so
far
as
his
thought
and
study
turned
upon
politics
it
seems
to
have
led
him
soon
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
for
the
present
no
part
to
play
that
was
worth
playing
by
as
he
said
himself
his
profession
as
a
lawyer
had
almost
superseded
the
thought
of
politics
in
his
mind
but
it
does
not
seem
that
the
melancholy
sense
of
some
great
purpose
unachieved
or
some
great
destiny
awaiting
him
ever
quite
left
him
he
must
have
felt
that
his
chance
of
political
fame
was
in
all
appearance
gone
and
would
have
liked
to
win
himself
a
considerable
position
and
a
little
very
little
money
as
a
lawyer
but
the
study
in
the
broadest
sense
of
which
these
years
were
full
evidently
contemplated
a
larger
education
of
himself
as
a
man
than
professional
keenness
or
any
such
interest
as
he
had
in
law
will
explain
and
from
his
own
point
of
view
a
failure
he
was
set
upon
making
himself
a
bigger
man
in
some
respects
he
let
himself
be
his
exterior
oddities
never
seem
to
have
toned
down
much
he
could
not
be
taught
to
introduce
tidiness
or
method
into
his
office
nor
did
he
make
himself
an
exact
lawyer
a
rough
and
ready
familiarity
with
practice
and
a
firm
grasp
of
larger
principles
of
law
contented
him
without
any
great
apparatus
of
learning
his
method
of
study
was
as
odd
as
anything
else
about
him
he
could
read
hard
and
commit
things
to
memory
in
the
midst
of
bustle
and
noise
on
the
other
hand
since
reading
aloud
was
his
chosen
way
of
impressing
what
he
read
on
his
own
mind
he
would
do
it
at
all
sorts
of
times
to
the
sore
distraction
of
his
partner
when
his
studies
are
spoken
of
observation
and
thought
on
some
plan
concealed
in
his
own
mind
must
be
taken
to
have
formed
the
largest
element
in
these
studies
there
was
however
one
methodic
discipline
highly
commended
of
old
but
seldom
perhaps
seriously
pursued
with
the
like
object
by
men
of
forty
even
men
which
he
did
pursue
some
time
during
these
years
he
mastered
the
first
six
books
of
euclid
it
would
probably
be
no
mere
fancy
if
we
were
to
trace
certain
definite
effects
of
this
discipline
upon
his
mind
and
character
the
faculty
which
he
had
before
shown
of
reducing
his
thought
on
any
subject
to
the
simplest
and
plainest
terms
possible
now
grew
so
strong
that
few
men
can
be
compared
with
him
in
this
he
was
gaining
too
from
some
source
what
the
ancient
geometers
would
themselves
have
claimed
as
partly
the
product
of
their
study
the
plain
fact
and
its
plain
consequences
were
not
only
clear
in
calm
hours
of
thought
but
remained
present
to
him
felt
and
instinctive
through
seasons
of
confusion
passion
and
dismay
his
life
in
one
sense
was
very
full
of
companionship
but
it
is
probable
that
in
his
real
intellectual
interests
he
was
lonely
to
herndon
intelligently
interested
in
many
things
his
master
mind
much
as
he
held
it
in
awe
seemed
chillingly
unpoetic
which
is
a
curious
view
of
a
mind
steeped
in
shakespeare
and
burns
the
two
partners
had
been
separately
to
niagara
herndon
was
anxious
to
know
what
had
been
lincoln
chief
impression
and
was
pained
by
the
reply
i
wondered
where
all
that
water
came
from
which
he
felt
showed
materialism
and
insensibility
lincoln
thought
had
very
obviously
a
sort
of
poetry
of
its
own
but
of
a
vast
and
rather
awful
kind
he
had
occasionally
written
verses
of
his
own
a
little
before
this
time
sad
verses
about
a
friend
who
had
become
a
lunatic
wondering
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
outlive
his
mind
while
happy
young
lives
passed
away
and
sad
verses
about
a
visit
to
old
familiar
fields
in
indiana
where
he
wandered
brooding
as
he
says
till
every
sound
appears
a
knell
and
every
spot
a
grave
they
are
not
great
poetry
but
they
show
a
correct
ear
for
verse
and
they
are
not
the
verses
of
a
man
to
whom
any
of
the
familiar
forms
of
poetic
association
were
unusual
they
are
those
of
a
man
in
whom
the
habitual
undercurrent
of
thought
was
melancholy
apart
from
these
signs
and
the
deep
humorous
delight
which
he
evidently
took
in
his
children
there
may
be
something
slightly
forbidding
in
this
figure
of
a
gaunt
man
disappointed
in
ambition
and
not
even
happy
at
home
rubbing
along
through
a
rather
rough
crowd
with
uniform
rough
geniality
and
perpetual
jest
all
the
while
in
secret
forging
his
own
mind
into
an
instrument
for
some
vaguely
foreshadowed
end
but
there
are
two
or
three
facts
which
stand
out
certain
and
have
to
be
taken
account
of
in
any
image
we
may
be
tempted
to
form
of
him
in
the
first
place
his
was
no
forbidding
figure
at
the
time
to
those
who
knew
him
a
queer
and
a
comic
figure
evidently
but
liked
trusted
and
by
some
loved
reputed
for
honest
dealing
and
for
kindly
and
gentle
dealing
remarked
too
by
some
at
that
time
as
before
and
ever
after
for
the
melancholy
of
his
face
in
repose
known
by
us
beyond
doubt
to
have
gone
through
great
pain
known
lastly
among
his
fellows
in
his
profession
for
a
fire
of
anger
that
flashed
out
only
in
the
presence
of
cruelty
and
wrong
his
law
practice
which
he
pursued
with
energy
and
on
which
he
was
now
it
seems
prepared
to
look
as
his
sole
business
in
life
fitted
in
none
the
less
well
with
his
deliberately
adopted
schemes
of
a
great
american
lawyer
choate
assures
us
that
at
the
illinois
bar
in
those
days
lincoln
had
to
measure
himself
against
very
considerable
men
in
suits
of
a
class
that
required
some
intellect
and
training
and
in
his
own
way
he
held
his
own
among
these
men
a
layman
may
humbly
conjecture
that
the
combination
in
one
person
of
the
advocate
and
the
solicitor
must
give
opportunities
of
far
truer
intellectual
training
than
the
mere
advocate
can
easily
enjoy
the
illinois
advocate
was
not
all
the
time
pleading
the
cause
which
he
was
employed
to
plead
and
which
if
it
was
once
offered
to
him
it
was
his
duty
to
accept
he
was
the
personal
adviser
of
the
client
whose
cause
he
pleaded
and
within
certain
limits
he
could
determine
whether
the
cause
was
brought
at
all
and
if
so
whether
he
should
take
it
up
himself
or
leave
it
to
another
man
the
rule
in
such
matters
was
elastic
and
practice
varied
lincoln
practice
went
to
the
very
limit
of
what
is
permissible
in
refusing
legal
aid
to
a
cause
he
disapproved
coming
into
court
he
discovered
suddenly
some
fact
about
his
case
which
was
new
to
him
but
which
would
probably
not
have
justified
an
english
barrister
in
throwing
up
his
brief
the
case
was
called
he
was
absent
the
judge
sent
to
his
hotel
and
got
back
a
message
tell
the
judge
i
washing
my
hands
one
client
received
advice
much
to
this
effect
i
can
win
your
case
i
can
get
you
i
can
also
make
an
honest
family
miserable
but
i
shall
not
take
your
case
and
i
shall
not
take
your
fee
one
piece
of
advice
i
will
give
you
gratis
go
home
and
think
seriously
whether
you
can
not
make
in
some
honest
way
and
this
habit
of
mind
was
beyond
his
control
colleagues
whom
he
was
engaged
to
assist
in
cases
agreed
that
if
a
case
lost
his
sympathy
he
became
helpless
and
useless
in
it
this
of
course
was
not
the
way
to
make
money
but
he
got
along
and
won
a
considerable
local
position
at
the
bar
for
his
perfect
honesty
in
argument
and
in
statement
of
fact
was
known
to
have
won
the
confidence
of
the
judges
and
a
difficult
case
which
he
thought
was
right
elicited
the
full
and
curious
powers
of
his
mind
his
invective
upon
occasion
was
by
all
accounts
terrific
an
advocate
glanced
at
lincoln
notes
for
his
speech
when
he
was
appearing
against
a
very
heartless
swindler
and
saw
that
they
concluded
with
the
ominous
words
skin
defendant
the
vitriolic
outburst
which
occurred
at
the
point
thus
indicated
seems
to
have
been
long
remembered
by
the
illinois
bar
to
a
young
man
who
wished
to
be
a
lawyer
yet
shrunk
from
the
profession
lest
it
should
necessarily
involve
some
dishonesty
lincoln
wrote
earnestly
and
wisely
showing
him
how
false
his
impression
of
the
law
was
but
concluding
with
earnest
entreaty
that
he
would
not
enter
the
profession
if
he
still
had
any
fear
of
being
led
by
it
to
become
a
knave
one
of
his
cases
is
interesting
for
its
own
sake
not
for
his
part
in
it
he
defended
without
fee
the
son
of
his
old
foe
and
friend
jack
armstrong
and
of

that
they

him
do
the
deed
about

such

night
they

quite
clearly
they
saw
it
so
clearly
because
of

that
night
another
case
is
interesting
for
his
sake
two
young
men
set
up
in
a
farm
together
bought
a
waggon
and
team
from
a
poor
old
farmer
lincoln
client
did
not
pay
him
and
were
sued
they
had
both
been
just
under
when
they
contracted
the
debt
and
they
were
advised
to
plead
infancy
a
stranger
who
was
present
in
court
described
afterwards
his
own
indignation
as
the
rascally
tale
was
unfolded
and
his
greater
indignation
as
he
watched
the
locally
famous
lincoln
lying
back
in
his
seat
nodding
complacently
and
saying
i
reckon
that
so
as
each
of
the
relevant
facts
was
produced
and
the
relevant
statute
read
and
expounded
at
last
as
the
onlooker
proceeded
to
relate
the
time
came
for
lincoln
to
address
the
jury
with
whom
by
illinois
law
the
issue
still
rested
slowly
he
disengaged
his
long
lean
form
from
his
seat
and
before
he
had
got
it
drawn
out
to
its
height
he
had
fixed
a
gaze
of
extraordinary
benevolence
on
the
two
disgraceful
young
defendants
and
begun
in
this
strain
gentlemen
of
the
jury
are
you
prepared
that
these
two
young
men
shall
enter
upon
life
and
go
through
life
with
the
stain
of
a
dishonourable
transaction
for
ever
affixed
to
them
and
so
forth
at
just
sufficient
length
and
with
just
enough
of
shakespearean
padding
about
honour
the
result
with
that
emotional
and
probably
irregular
western
court
is
obvious
and
the
story
concludes
with
the
quite
credible
assertion
that
the
defendants
themselves
were
relieved
any
good
jury
would
of
course
have
been
steeled
against
the
appeal
which
might
have
been
expected
to
their
compassion
for
a
poor
and
honest
old
man
a
kind
of
innocent
and
benign
cunning
has
been
the
most
engaging
quality
in
not
a
few
great
characters
it
is
tempting
though
at
the
risk
of
undue
solemnity
to
look
for
the
secret
of
lincoln
cunning
in
this
instance
we
know
from
copybooks
and
other
sources
that
these
two
young
men
starting
on
the
down
grade
with
the
help
of
their
blackguardly
legal
adviser
were
objects
for
pity
more
so
than
the
man
who
was
about
to
lose
a
certain
number
of
dollars
lincoln
as
few
other
men
would
have
done
felt
a
certain
actual
regret
for
them
then
and
there
he
felt
it
so
naturally
that
he
knew
the
same
sympathy
could
be
aroused
at
least
in
twelve
honest
men
who
already
wished
they
could
find
for
the
plaintiff
it
has
often
been
remarked
that
the
cause
of
his
later
power
was
a
knowledge
of
the
people
mind
which
was
curiously
but
vitally
bound
up
with
his
own
rectitude
any
attempt
that
we
may
make
to
analyse
a
subtle
character
and
in
some
respects
to
trace
its
growth
is
certain
to
miss
the
exact
mark
but
it
is
in
any
case
plain
that
abraham
lincoln
left
political
life
in
a
praiseworthy
man
with
good
sound
views
but
with
nothing
much
to
distinguish
him
above
many
other
such
and
at
a
sudden
call
returned
to
political
life
in
with
a
touch
of
something
quite
uncommon
added
to
those
good
sound
views
repeal
of
the
missouri
the
south
had
become
captive
to
politicians
personally
reputable
and
of
some
executive
capacity
who
had
converted
its
natural
prejudice
into
a
definite
doctrine
which
was
paradoxical
and
almost
inconceivably
narrow
and
who
as
is
common
in
such
instances
of
perversion
and
fanaticism
knew
hardly
any
scruple
in
the
practical
enforcement
of
their
doctrine
in
the
north
on
the
other
hand
though
there
were
some
few
politicians
who
were
clever
and
public
opinion
had
no
very
definite
character
and
public
men
generally
speaking
were
flabby
at
such
a
time
the
sheer
adventurer
has
an
excellent
field
before
him
and
perhaps
has
his
appointed
use
stephen
douglas
who
was
four
years
younger
than
lincoln
had
come
to
illinois
from
the
eastern
states
just
about
the
time
when
lincoln
entered
the
legislature
he
had
neither
money
nor
friends
to
start
with
but
almost
immediately
secured
by
his
extraordinary
address
in
pushing
himself
a
clerkship
in
the
assembly
he
soon
became
like
lincoln
a
lawyer
and
a
legislator
but
was
on
the
democratic
side
he
rapidly
soared
into
regions
beyond
the
reach
of
lincoln
and
in
became
a
senator
for
illinois
where
he
later
became
chairman
of
the
committee
on
territories
and
as
such
had
to
consider
the
question
of
providing
for
the
government
of
the
districts
called
kansas
and
nebraska
which
lay
west
and
of
missouri
and
from
which
slavery
was
excluded
by
the
missouri
compromise
he
was
what
in
england
is
called
a
jingo
and
was
at
one
time
eager
to
fight
this
country
for
the
possession
of
what
is
now
british
columbia
his
short
figure
gave
an
impression
of
abounding
strength
and
energy
which
obtained
him
the
nickname
of
the
little
giant
with
no
assignable
higher
quality
and
with
the
blustering
declamatory
shamelessly
fallacious
and
evasive
oratory
of
a
common
demagogue
he
was
nevertheless
an
accomplished
parliamentarian
and
imposed
himself
as
effectively
upon
the
senate
as
he
did
upon
the
people
of
illinois
and
the
north
generally
he
was
no
doubt
a
remarkable
man
with
the
gift
of
attracting
many
people
a
political
opponent
has
described
vividly
how
at
first
sight
he
was
instantly
repelled
by
the
sinister
and
dangerous
air
of
douglas
scowl
a
still
stronger
opponent
but
a
woman
beecher
stowe
seems
on
the
contrary
to
have
found
it
impossible
to
hate
him
what
he
now
did
displayed
at
any
rate
a
sporting
quality
in
the
course
of
stephen
douglas
while
in
charge
of
an
inoffensive
bill
dealing
with
the
government
of
kansas
and
nebraska
converted
it
into
a
form
in
which
it
empowered
the
people
of
kansas
at
any
time
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
would
permit
slavery
or
not
and
in
express
terms
repealed
the
missouri
compromise
with
the
easy
connivance
of
president
pierce
and
the
enthusiastic
support
of
the
southerners
and
by
some
extraordinary
exercise
of
his
art
as
demagogue
and
parliamentarian
he
triumphantly
ran
this
measure
through
just
how
it
came
about
seems
to
be
rather
obscure
but
it
is
easy
to
conjecture
his
motives
trained
in
a
school
in
which
scruple
or
principle
were
unknown
and
the
man
who
arrives
is
the
great
man
douglas
like
other
such
adventurers
was
accessible
to
visions
of
a
sort
he
cared
nothing
whether
negroes
were
slaves
or
not
and
doubtless
despised
northern
and
southern
sentiment
on
that
subject
equally
as
he
frankly
said
once
on
any
question
between
white
men
and
negroes
he
was
on
the
side
of
the
white
men
and
on
any
question
between
negroes
and
crocodiles
he
would
be
on
the
side
of
the
negroes
but
he
did
care
for
the
development
of
the
great
national
heritage
in
the
west
that
subject
of
an
easy
but
perfectly
wholesome
patriotic
pride
with
which
we
are
familiar
it
must
have
been
a
satisfaction
to
him
to
feel
that
north
and
south
would
now
have
an
equal
chance
in
that
heritage
and
also
that
the
white
settlers
in
the
west
would
be
relieved
of
any
restriction
on
their
freedom
none
the
less
his
action
was
to
the
last
degree
reckless
the
north
had
shown
itself
ready
in
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
of
quiet
invasion
of
its
former
principle
but
to
lay
hands
upon
the
sacred
letter
of
the
act
in
which
that
principle
was
enshrined
was
to
invite
exciting
consequences
the
immediate
consequences
were
in
the
first
place
southern
settlers
came
pouring
into
kansas
and
northern
settlers
in
still
larger
numbers
rendered
larger
still
by
the
help
of
an
emigration
society
formed
in
the
for
that
purpose
came
pouring
in
too
it
was
at
first
a
race
to
win
kansas
for
slavery
or
for
freedom
when
it
became
apparent
that
freedom
was
winning
easily
the
race
turned
into
a
civil
war
between
these
two
classes
of
immigrants
for
the
possession
of
the
territorial
government
and
this
kept
on
its
scandalous
and
bloody
course
for
three
or
four
years
in
the
second
place
there
was
a
revolution
in
the
party
system
the
old
whig
party
which
whatever
its
tendencies
had
avoided
having
any
principle
in
regard
to
slavery
now
abruptly
and
opportunely
expired
there
had
been
an
attempt
once
before
and
that
time
mainly
among
the
democrats
to
create
a
new
party
but
it
had
come
to
very
little
this
time
a
permanent
fusion
was
accomplished
between
the
majority
of
the
former
whigs
in
the
north
and
a
numerous
secession
from
among
the
northern
democrats
they
created
the
great
republican
party
of
which
the
name
and
organisation
have
continued
to
this
day
but
of
which
the
original
principle
was
simply
and
solely
that
there
should
be
no
further
extension
of
slavery
upon
territory
present
or
future
of
the
united
states
it
naturally
consisted
of
northerners
only
this
was
of
course
an
ominous
fact
and
caused
people
who
were
too
timid
either
to
join
the
republicans
or
turn
democrat
to
take
refuge
in
another
strange
party
formed
about
this
time
which
had
no
views
about
slavery
this
was
the
american
party
commonly
called
the
party
from
its
ridiculous
and
objectionable
secret
organisation
its
principle
was
dislike
of
foreign
immigrants
especially
such
as
were
roman
catholics
to
them
fillmore
protesting
against
the
madness
of
the
times
when
men
ventured
to
say
yes
or
no
on
a
question
relating
to
slavery
fled
for
comfort
and
became
their
candidate
for
the
presidency
at
the
next
election
it
was
in
that
lincoln
returned
to
political
life
as
one
of
the
founders
of
the
republican
party
but
it
will
be
better
at
once
to
deal
with
one
or
two
later
events
with
which
he
was
not
specially
concerned
the
republicans
chose
as
their
presidential
candidate
in
an
attractive
figure
john
frémont
a
southerner
of
french
origin
who
had
conducted
daring
and
successful
explorations
in
oregon
had
some
hand
perhaps
a
very
important
hand
in
conquering
california
from
mexico
and
played
a
prominent
part
in
securing
california
for
freedom
the
southern
democrats
again
secured
a
northern
instrument
in
james
buchanan
of
pennsylvania
an
elderly
and
very
respectable
man
who
was
understood
to
be
well
versed
in
diplomatic
and
official
life
he
was
a
more
memorable
personage
than
pierce
a
great
chorus
of
friendly
witnesses
to
his
character
has
united
in
ascribing
all
his
actions
to
weakness
buchanan
was
elected
but
for
a
party
the
republicans
had
put
up
a
very
good
fight
and
they
were
in
the
highest
of
spirits
when
shortly
after
buchanan
inauguration
in
a
staggering
blow
fell
upon
them
from
an
unexpected
quarter
this
was
nothing
less
than
a
pronouncement
by
the
chief
justice
and
a
majority
of
justices
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
the
exclusion
of
slavery
from
any
portion
of
the
territories
and
therefore
of
course
the
whole
aim
and
object
of
the
republicans
was
as
calhoun
had
contended
eight
or
ten
years
before
unconstitutional
dred
scott
was
a
missouri
slave
whose
misfortunes
it
is
needless
to
compassionate
since
after
giving
his
name
to
one
of
the
most
famous
law
cases
in
history
he
was
emancipated
with
his
family
by
a
new
master
into
whose
hands
he
had
passed
some
time
before
the
missouri
compromise
was
repealed
he
had
been
taken
by
his
master
into
minnesota
as
a
result
of
which
he
claimed
that
he
became
by
virtue
of
the
missouri
compromise
a
free
man
his
right
to
sue
his
master
in
a
federal
court
rested
on
the
allegation
that
he
was
now
a
citizen
of
missouri
while
his
master
was
a
citizen
of
another
state
there
was
thus
a
preliminary
question
to
be
decided
was
he
really
a
citizen
before
the
question
was
he
a
freeman
could
arise
at
all
if
the
supreme
court
followed
its
established
practice
and
if
it
decided
against
his
citizenship
it
would
not
consider
the
question
which
interested
the
public
that
of
his
freedom
chief
justice
roger
taney
may
be
seen
from
the
refined
features
of
his
portrait
and
the
literary
style
of
his
famous
judgment
to
have
been
a
remarkable
man
he
was
now
but
in
unimpaired
intellectual
vigour
in
a
judgment
with
which
five
of
his
colleagues
entirely
concurred
and
from
which
only
two
dissented
he
decided
that
dred
scott
was
not
a
citizen
and
went
on
contrary
to
practice
to
pronounce
in
what
was
probably
to
be
considered
as
a
mere
that
dred
scott
was
not
free
because
the
missouri
compromise
had
all
along
been
unconstitutional
and
void
justices
mclean
and
curtis
especially
the
latter
answered
taney
arguments
in
cogent
judgments
which
it
seems
generally
to
be
thought
were
right
many
lawyers
thought
so
then
and
so
did
the
prudent
fillmore
this
is
one
of
the
rare
cases
where
a
layman
may
have
an
opinion
on
a
point
of
law
for
the
argument
of
taney
was
entirely
historical
and
rested
upon
the
opinion
as
to
negroes
and
slavery
which
he
ascribed
to
the
makers
of
the
constitution
and
the
authors
of
the
declaration
of
independence
on
the
question
of
scott
citizenship
he
laid
down
that
these
men
had
hardly
counted
africans
as
human
at
all
and
used
words
such
as
men
persons
citizens
in
a
sense
which
necessarily
excluded
the
negro
we
have
seen
already
that
he
was
wrong
the
southern
politician
who
called
the
words
of
the
declaration
of
independence
a
lie
was
a
sounder
historian
than
taney
but
an
amazing
fact
is
to
be
added
the
constitution
whose
authors
according
to
taney
could
not
conceive
of
a
negro
as
a
citizen
was
actually
the
act
of
a
number
of
states
in
several
of
which
negroes
were
exercising
the
full
rights
of
citizens
at
the
time
it
would
be
easy
to
bring
almost
equally
plain
considerations
to
bear
against
the
more
elaborate
argument
of
taney
that
the
missouri
compromise
was
unconstitutional
but
it
is
enough
to
say
this
much
the
first
four
presidents
that
is
all
the
presidents
who
were
in
public
life
when
the
constitution
was
made
had
all
acted
unhesitatingly
upon
the
belief
that
congress
had
the
power
to
allow
or
forbid
slavery
in
the
territories
the
fifth
john
quincy
adams
when
he
set
his
hand
to
acts
involving
this
principle
had
consulted
before
doing
so
the
whole
of
his
cabinet
on
this
constitutional
point
and
had
signed
such
legislation
with
the
full
concurrence
of
them
all
even
polk
had
acted
later
upon
the
same
view
the
dred
scott
judgment
would
thus
appear
to
show
the
penetrating
power
at
that
time
of
an
altogether
fantastic
opinion
the
hope
which
taney
is
known
to
have
entertained
that
his
judgment
would
compose
excited
public
opinion
was
by
no
means
fulfilled
it
raised
fierce
excitement
what
practical
effect
would
hereafter
be
given
to
the
opinion
of
six
out
of
the
nine
judges
in
that
court
might
depend
on
many
things
but
to
the
republicans
who
appealed
much
to
antiquity
it
was
maddening
to
be
thus
assured
that
their
whole
platform
was
unconstitutional
in
the
long
run
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
taney
helped
the
cause
of
freedom
he
had
tried
to
make
evident
the
personal
sense
of
compassion
for
these
unfortunate
people
with
which
he
contemplated
the
opinion
that
he
ascribed
to
a
past
generation
but
he
failed
to
do
this
and
instead
he
succeeded
in
imparting
to
the
supposed
constitutional
view
of
the
slave
as
nothing
but
a
chattel
a
horror
which
went
home
to
many
thousands
of
the
men
and
women
of
his
country
for
the
time
however
the
republicans
were
deeply
depressed
and
a
further
perplexity
shortly
befell
them
an
attempt
to
which
we
must
shortly
return
was
made
to
impose
the
slave
system
on
kansas
against
the
now
unmistakable
will
of
the
majority
there
against
this
attempt
douglas
in
opposition
to
whom
the
republican
party
had
been
formed
revolted
to
his
lasting
honour
and
he
now
stood
out
for
the
occasion
as
the
champion
of
freedom
it
was
at
this
late
period
of
bewilderment
and
confusion
that
the
of
abraham
lincoln
became
one
with
the
of
the
american
people
chapter
v
the
rise
of
lincoln
return
to
public
we
possess
a
single
familiar
letter
in
which
lincoln
opened
his
heart
about
politics
it
was
written
while
old
political
ties
were
not
yet
quite
broken
and
new
ties
not
quite
knit
and
it
was
written
to
an
old
and
a
dear
friend
who
was
not
his
political
associate
we
may
fittingly
place
it
here
as
a
record
of
the
strong
and
conflicting
feelings
out
of
which
his
consistent
purpose
in
this
crisis
was
formed
august
to
joshua
speed
you
know
what
a
poor
correspondent
i
am
ever
since
i
received
your
very
agreeable
letter
of
the
i
have
been
intending
to
write
you
an
answer
to
it
you
suggest
that
in
political
action
now
you
and
i
would
differ
i
suppose
we
would
not
quite
so
much
however
as
you
may
think
you
know
i
dislike
slavery
and
you
fully
admit
the
abstract
wrong
of
it
so
far
there
is
no
cause
of
difference
but
you
say
that
sooner
than
yield
your
legal
right
to
the
slave
especially
at
the
bidding
of
those
who
are
not
themselves
interested
you
would
see
the
union
dissolved
i
am
not
aware
that
any
one
is
bidding
you
yield
that
right
very
certainly
i
am
not
i
leave
that
matter
entirely
to
yourself
i
also
acknowledge
your
rights
and
my
obligations
under
the
constitution
in
regard
to
your
slaves
i
confess
i
hate
to
see
the
poor
creatures
hunted
down
and
caught
and
carried
back
to
their
stripes
and
unrequited
toil
but
i
bite
my
lips
and
keep
quiet
in
you
and
i
had
together
a
tedious
trip
on
a
steamboat
from
louisville
to
louis
you
may
remember
as
i
well
do
that
from
louisville
to
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
there
were
on
board
ten
or
a
dozen
slaves
shackled
together
with
irons
that
sight
was
a
continual
torment
to
me
and
i
see
something
like
it
every
time
i
touch
the
ohio
or
any
other
slave
border
it
is
not
fair
for
you
to
assume
that
i
have
no
interest
in
a
thing
which
has
and
continually
exercises
the
power
to
make
me
miserable
you
ought
rather
to
appreciate
how
much
the
great
body
of
the
northern
people
do
crucify
their
feelings
in
order
to
maintain
their
loyalty
to
the
constitution
and
the
union
i
do
oppose
the
extension
of
slavery
because
my
judgment
and
feelings
so
prompt
me
and
i
am
under
no
obligations
to
the
contrary
if
for
this
you
and
i
must
differ
differ
we
must
you
say
that
if
kansas
fairly
votes
herself
a
free
state
as
a
christian
you
will
rejoice
at
it
all
decent
slave
holders
talk
that
way
and
i
do
not
doubt
their
candour
but
they
never
vote
that
way
although
in
a
private
letter
or
conversation
you
will
express
your
preference
that
kansas
shall
be
free
you
will
vote
for
no
man
for
congress
who
would
say
the
same
thing
publicly
no
such
man
could
be
elected
from
any
district
in
a
slave
state
the
slave
breeders
and
slave
traders
are
a
small
odious
and
detested
class
among
you
and
yet
in
politics
they
dictate
the
course
of
all
of
you
and
are
as
completely
your
masters
as
you
are
the
masters
of
your
own
negroes
you
inquire
where
i
now
stand
that
is
a
disputed
point
i
think
i
am
a
whig
but
others
say
there
are
no
whigs
and
that
i
am
an
abolitionist
when
i
was
at
washington
i
voted
for
the
wilmot
proviso
as
good
as
forty
times
and
i
never
heard
of
any
one
attempting
to
me
for
that
i
now
do
no
more
than
oppose
the
extension
of
slavery
i
am
not
a
that
is
certain
how
could
i
be
how
can
any
one
who
abhors
the
oppression
of
negroes
be
in
favour
of
degrading
classes
of
white
people
our
progress
in
degeneracy
appears
to
me
pretty
rapid
as
a
nation
we
began
by
declaring
that
men
are
created
equal
we
now
practically
read
it
men
are
created
equal
except
negroes
when
the
get
control
it
will
read
men
are
created
equal
except
negroes
and
foreigners
and
catholics
when
it
comes
to
this
i
shall
prefer
emigrating
to
some
country
where
they
make
no
pretence
of
loving
liberty
to
russia
for
instance
where
despotism
can
be
taken
pure
and
without
the
base
alloy
of
hypocrisy
mary
will
probably
pass
a
day
or
two
in
louisville
in
october
my
kindest
regards
to
mrs
speed
on
the
leading
subject
of
this
letter
i
have
more
of
her
sympathy
than
i
have
of
yours
and
yet
let
me
say
i
am
your
friend
forever
a
lincoln
the
shade
of
doubt
which
this
letter
suggests
related
really
to
the
composition
of
political
parties
and
the
grouping
of
political
forces
not
in
the
least
to
the
principles
by
which
lincoln
own
actions
would
be
guided
he
has
himself
recorded
that
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
meant
for
him
the
sudden
revival
in
a
far
stronger
form
of
his
interest
in
politics
and
we
may
add
of
his
political
ambition
the
opinions
which
he
cherished
most
deeply
demanded
no
longer
patience
but
vehement
action
the
faculties
of
political
organisation
and
of
popular
debate
of
which
he
enjoyed
the
exercise
could
now
be
used
for
a
purpose
which
satisfied
his
understanding
and
his
heart
from
onwards
we
find
lincoln
almost
incessantly
occupied
at
conventions
at
public
meetings
in
correspondence
in
secret
consultation
with
those
who
looked
to
him
for
counsel
for
the
one
object
of
strengthening
the
new
republican
movement
in
his
own
state
of
illinois
and
so
far
as
opportunity
offered
in
the
neighbouring
states
some
of
the
best
of
his
reported
and
the
most
effective
of
his
unreported
speeches
were
delivered
between
and
yet
as
large
a
part
of
his
work
in
these
years
was
done
quietly
in
the
background
and
it
continued
to
be
his
fate
to
be
called
upon
to
efface
himself
it
is
unnecessary
to
follow
in
any
detail
the
labours
by
which
he
became
a
great
leader
in
illinois
it
may
suffice
to
pick
out
two
instances
that
illustrate
the
ways
of
this
astute
unselfish
man
the
first
is
very
trifling
and
shows
him
merely
astute
a
springfield
newspaper
called
the
was
acquiring
too
much
influence
as
the
organ
of
moderate
and
decent
opinion
that
acquiesced
in
the
extension
of
negro
slavery
the
abolitionist
herndon
was
a
friend
of
the
editor
one
day
he
showed
lincoln
an
article
in
a
southern
paper
which
most
boldly
justified
slavery
whether
the
slaves
were
black
or
white
lincoln
observed
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
if
the
papers
of
illinois
could
be
led
to
go
this
length
herndon
ingeniously
used
his
acquaintance
with
the
editor
to
procure
that
he
should
reprint
this
article
with
approval
of
course
that
promising
journalistic
venture
the
was
at
once
ruined
by
so
gross
an
indiscretion
this
was
hard
on
its
confiding
editor
and
it
is
not
to
lincoln
credit
that
he
suggested
or
connived
at
this
trick
but
this
trumpery
tale
happens
to
be
a
fair
illustration
of
two
things
in
the
first
place
a
large
part
of
lincoln
activity
went
in
the
industrious
and
watchful
performance
of
services
to
his
cause
very
seldom
as
questionable
but
constantly
as
minute
as
this
and
in
making
himself
as
in
this
case
confidant
and
adviser
to
a
number
of
less
notable
workers
in
the
second
place
a
biographer
must
set
forth
if
he
can
the
materials
for
the
severest
judgment
on
his
subject
and
in
the
case
of
a
man
whose
fame
was
built
on
his
honesty
but
who
certainly
had
an
aptitude
for
ingenious
tricks
and
took
a
humorous
delight
in
them
this
duty
might
involve
a
tedious
examination
of
many
unimportant
incidents
it
may
save
such
discussion
hereafter
to
say
as
can
safely
be
said
upon
a
study
of
all
the
transactions
in
his
life
of
which
the
circumstances
are
known
that
this
trick
on
the
editor
of
the
marks
the
limit
of
lincoln
deviation
from
the
straight
path
most
of
us
might
be
very
glad
if
we
had
really
never
done
anything
much
more
dishonest
our
second
tale
of
this
period
is
much
more
memorable
in
the
term
of
office
of
one
of
the
senators
for
illinois
came
to
an
end
and
there
was
a
chance
of
electing
an
opponent
of
douglas
those
of
the
republicans
of
illinois
who
were
former
whigs
desired
the
election
of
lincoln
but
could
only
secure
it
by
the
adhesion
of
a
sufficient
number
of
former
democrats
and
waverers
united
states
senators
were
elected
by
the
legislatures
of
their
own
states
through
a
procedure
similar
to
that
of
the
conclave
of
cardinals
which
elects
a
pope
if
there
were
several
candidates
and
no
one
of
them
had
an
absolute
majority
of
the
votes
first
cast
the
candidate
with
most
votes
was
not
elected
the
voting
was
repeated
perhaps
many
times
till
some
one
had
an
absolute
majority
the
final
result
was
brought
about
by
a
transfer
of
votes
from
one
candidate
to
another
in
which
the
prompt
and
cunning
had
sometimes
a
magnificent
opportunity
for
his
skill
in
this
particular
contest
there
were
many
ballots
and
lincoln
at
first
led
his
supporters
were
full
of
eager
hope
lincoln
looking
on
discerned
before
any
of
them
the
setting
in
of
an
likely
to
result
in
the
election
of
a
supporter
of
douglas
he
discerned
too
that
the
surest
way
to
prevent
this
was
for
the
whole
of
his
friends
immediately
to
go
over
to
the
democrat
lyman
trumbull
who
was
a
sound
opponent
of
slavery
he
sacrificed
his
own
chance
instantly
by
persuading
his
supporters
to
do
this
they
were
very
reluctant
but
he
overbore
them
one
a
very
old
friend
records
that
he
never
saw
him
more
earnest
and
decided
the
same
friend
records
what
is
necessary
to
the
appreciation
of
lincoln
conduct
that
his
personal
disappointment
and
mortification
at
his
failure
were
great
lincoln
it
will
be
remembered
had
acted
just
in
this
way
when
he
sought
election
to
the
house
of
representatives
he
was
to
repeat
this
line
of
conduct
in
a
manner
at
least
as
striking
in
the
following
year
minute
criticism
of
his
action
in
many
matters
becomes
pointless
when
we
observe
that
his
managing
shrewdness
was
never
more
signally
displayed
than
it
was
three
times
over
in
the
sacrifice
of
his
own
personal
chances
for
four
years
it
is
to
be
remembered
the
activity
and
influence
of
which
we
are
speaking
were
of
little
importance
beyond
the
boundaries
of
illinois
it
is
true
that
at
the
republican
convention
in
which
chose
frémont
as
its
candidate
for
the
presidency
lincoln
was
exposed
for
a
moment
to
the
risk
for
so
it
was
to
be
regarded
of
being
nominated
for
the
but
even
his
greatest
speech
was
not
noticed
outside
illinois
and
in
the
greater
part
of
the
northern
states
his
name
was
known
to
comparatively
few
and
to
them
only
as
a
local
notability
of
the
west
but
in
the
course
of
he
challenged
the
attention
of
the
whole
country
there
was
again
a
vacancy
for
a
senator
for
illinois
douglas
was
the
sole
and
obvious
candidate
of
the
democrats
lincoln
came
forward
as
his
opponent
the
elections
then
pending
of
the
state
legislature
which
in
its
turn
would
elect
a
senator
became
a
contest
between
lincoln
and
douglas
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
these
rival
champions
held
seven
joint
debates
before
mass
meetings
in
the
open
air
at
important
towns
of
illinois
taking
turns
in
the
right
of
opening
the
debate
and
replying
at
its
close
in
addition
each
was
speaking
at
meetings
of
his
own
at
least
once
a
day
for
three
months
at
the
end
of
it
all
douglas
had
won
his
seat
in
the
senate
and
lincoln
had
not
yet
gained
recognition
among
the
republican
leaders
as
one
of
themselves
nevertheless
the
contest
between
lincoln
and
douglas
was
one
of
the
decisive
events
in
american
history
partly
from
the
mere
fact
that
at
that
particular
moment
any
one
opposed
douglas
at
all
partly
from
the
manner
in
which
in
the
hearing
of
all
america
lincoln
formulated
the
issue
between
them
partly
from
the
singular
stroke
by
which
he
deliberately
ensured
his
own
defeat
and
certain
further
consequences
principles
and
the
oratory
of
we
can
best
understand
the
causes
which
suddenly
made
him
a
man
of
national
consequence
by
a
somewhat
close
examination
of
the
principles
and
the
spirit
which
governed
all
his
public
activity
from
the
moment
of
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
the
new
republican
party
which
then
began
to
form
itself
stood
for
what
might
seem
a
simple
creed
slavery
must
be
tolerated
where
it
existed
because
the
constitution
and
the
maintenance
of
the
union
required
it
but
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
extend
beyond
its
present
limits
because
it
was
fundamentally
wrong
this
was
what
most
whigs
and
many
democrats
in
the
north
had
always
held
but
the
formulation
of
it
as
the
platform
of
a
party
and
a
party
which
must
draw
its
members
almost
entirely
from
the
north
was
bound
to
raise
in
an
acute
form
questions
on
which
very
few
men
had
searched
their
hearts
men
who
hated
slavery
were
likely
to
falter
and
find
excuses
for
yielding
when
confronted
with
the
danger
to
the
union
which
would
arise
men
who
loved
the
union
might
in
the
last
resort
be
ready
to
sacrifice
it
if
they
could
thereby
be
rid
of
complicity
with
slavery
or
might
be
unwilling
to
maintain
it
at
the
cost
of
fratricidal
war
the
stress
of
conflicting
emotions
and
the
complications
of
the
political
situation
were
certain
to
try
to
the
uttermost
the
faith
of
any
republican
who
was
not
very
sure
just
how
much
he
cared
for
the
union
and
how
much
for
freedom
and
what
loyalty
to
either
principle
involved
it
was
the
distinction
of
lincoln
a
man
lacking
in
much
of
the
knowledge
which
statesmen
are
supposed
to
possess
and
capable
of
blundering
and
hesitation
about
details
first
that
upon
questions
like
these
he
was
free
from
ambiguity
of
thought
or
faltering
of
will
and
further
that
upon
his
difficult
path
amid
bewildering
and
terrifying
circumstances
he
was
able
to
take
with
him
the
minds
of
very
many
very
ordinary
men
in
a
slightly
conventional
memorial
oration
upon
clay
lincoln
had
said
of
him
that
he
loved
his
country
partly
because
it
was
his
own
country
and
mostly
because
it
was
a
free
country
he
might
truly
have
said
the
like
of
himself
to
him
the
national
unity
of
america
with
the
constitution
which
symbolised
it
was
the
subject
of
pride
and
of
devotion
just
in
so
far
as
it
had
embodied
and
could
hereafter
more
fully
embody
certain
principles
of
permanent
value
to
mankind
on
this
he
fully
knew
his
own
inner
mind
for
the
preservation
of
an
america
which
he
could
value
more
say
than
men
value
the
argentine
republic
he
was
to
show
himself
better
prepared
than
any
other
man
to
pay
any
possible
price
but
he
definitely
refused
to
preserve
the
union
by
what
in
his
estimation
would
have
been
the
real
surrender
of
the
principles
which
had
made
americans
a
distinct
and
nation
those
principles
he
found
in
the
declaration
of
independence
its
rhetorical
inexactitude
gave
him
no
trouble
and
must
not
now
that
its
language
is
out
of
fashion
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
the
founders
of
the
united
states
did
deliberately
aspire
to
found
a
commonwealth
in
which
common
men
and
women
should
count
for
more
than
elsewhere
and
in
which
as
we
might
now
phrase
it
all
authority
must
defer
somewhat
to
the
interests
and
to
the
sentiments
of
the
under
dog
public
opinion
on
any
subject
he
said
always
has
a
idea
from
which
all
its
minor
thoughts
radiate
the
idea
in
our
public
opinion
at
the
beginning
was
and
till
recently
has
continued
to
be
equality
of
man
and
although
it
has
always
submitted
patiently
to
whatever
inequality
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
actual
necessity
its
constant
working
has
been
a
steady
and
progressive
effort
towards
the
practical
equality
of
all
men
the
fathers
he
said
again
had
never
intended
any
such
obvious
untruth
as
that
equality
actually
existed
or
that
any
action
of
theirs
could
immediately
create
it
but
they
had
set
up
a
standard
to
which
continual
approximation
could
be
made
so
far
as
white
men
were
concerned
such
approximation
had
actually
taken
place
the
audiences
lincoln
addressed
were
fully
conscious
that
very
many
thousands
had
found
in
the
united
states
a
scope
to
lead
their
own
lives
which
the
traditions
and
institutions
no
less
than
the
physical
conditions
of
their
former
countries
had
denied
them
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
enlarge
on
this
fact
but
there
are
repeated
indications
of
the
distaste
and
alarm
with
which
he
witnessed
a
demand
that
newcomers
from
europe
or
some
classes
of
them
should
be
accorded
lesser
privileges
than
they
had
enjoyed
but
notions
of
freedom
and
equality
as
applied
to
the
negroes
presented
a
real
difficulty
there
is
said
lincoln
a
natural
disgust
in
the
minds
of
nearly
all
white
people
at
the
idea
of
an
indiscriminate
amalgamation
of
the
white
and
black
men
we
might
perhaps
add
that
as
the
inferior
race
becomes
educated
and
rises
in
status
it
is
likely
itself
to
share
the
same
disgust
lincoln
himself
disliked
the
thought
of
intermarriage
between
the
races
he
by
no
means
took
it
for
granted
that
equality
in
political
power
must
necessarily
and
properly
follow
upon
emancipation
schemes
for
colonial
settlement
of
the
negroes
in
africa
or
for
gradual
emancipation
accompanied
by
educational
measures
appealed
to
his
sympathy
it
was
not
given
him
to
take
a
part
in
the
settlement
after
the
war
and
it
is
impossible
to
guess
what
he
would
have
achieved
as
a
constructive
statesman
but
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
proceeded
with
caution
and
with
the
patience
of
sure
faith
and
he
had
that
human
sympathy
with
the
white
people
of
the
south
and
no
less
with
the
slaves
themselves
which
taught
him
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
but
difficult
as
the
problem
was
one
solution
was
certainly
wrong
and
that
was
the
permanent
acquiescence
in
slavery
if
we
may
judge
from
reiteration
in
his
speeches
no
sophism
angered
him
quite
so
much
as
the
very
popular
sophism
which
defended
slavery
by
presenting
a
literal
equality
as
the
real
alternative
to
it
i
protest
against
the
counterfeit
logic
which
says
that
since
i
do
not
want
a
negro
woman
for
my
slave
i
must
necessarily
want
her
for
my
wife
i
may
want
her
for
neither
i
may
simply
let
her
alone
in
some
respects
she
is
certainly
not
my
equal
but
in
her
natural
right
to
eat
the
bread
which
she
has
earned
by
the
sweat
of
her
brow
she
is
my
equal
and
the
equal
of
any
man
the
men
who
had
made
the
union
had
as
lincoln
contended
and
in
regard
to
most
of
them
contended
justly
been
true
to
principle
in
their
dealing
with
slavery
they
yielded
to
slavery
he
insists
what
the
necessity
of
the
case
required
and
they
yielded
nothing
more
it
was
as
we
know
impossible
for
them
in
federating
america
however
much
they
might
hope
to
inspire
the
new
nation
with
just
ideas
to
take
the
power
of
legislating
as
to
slavery
within
each
existing
state
out
of
the
hands
of
that
state
such
power
as
they
actually
possessed
of
striking
at
slavery
they
used
as
we
have
seen
and
as
lincoln
recounted
in
detail
with
all
promptitude
and
almost
to
its
fullest
extent
they
reasonably
believed
though
wrongly
that
the
natural
tendency
of
opinion
throughout
the
now
freed
colonies
with
principles
of
freedom
in
the
air
would
work
steadily
towards
emancipation
the
fathers
lincoln
could
fairly
say
place
slavery
where
the
public
mind
could
rest
in
the
belief
that
it
was
in
the
course
of
ultimate
extinction
the
task
for
statesmen
now
was
to
put
slavery
back
where
the
fathers
placed
it
now
this
by
no
means
implied
that
slavery
in
the
states
which
now
adhered
to
it
should
be
exposed
to
attack
from
outside
or
the
slave
owner
be
denied
any
right
which
he
could
claim
under
the
constitution
however
odious
and
painful
it
might
be
as
in
the
case
of
the
rendition
of
fugitive
slaves
to
yield
him
his
rights
we
allow
says
lincoln
slavery
to
exist
in
the
slave
states
not
because
it
is
right
but
from
the
necessities
of
the
union
we
grant
a
fugitive
slave
law
because
it
is
so
in
the
bond
because
our
fathers
so
stipulated
had
to
and
we
are
bound
to
carry
out
this
agreement
and
the
obligations
to
the
slave
owners
and
the
slave
states
which
this
original
agreement
and
the
fundamental
necessities
of
the
union
involved
must
be
fulfilled
unswervingly
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
the
letter
lincoln
was
ready
to
give
the
slave
states
any
possible
guarantee
that
the
constitution
should
not
be
altered
so
as
to
take
away
their
existing
right
of
in
the
matter
of
slavery
he
had
remained
in
the
past
coldly
aloof
from
the
abolitionist
propaganda
when
herndon
and
other
friends
tried
to
interest
him
in
it
feeling
it
seems
that
agitation
in
the
free
states
against
laws
which
existed
constitutionally
in
the
slave
states
was
not
only
futile
but
improper
with
all
his
power
he
dissuaded
his
more
impulsive
friends
from
lending
any
aid
to
forcible
and
unlawful
proceedings
in
defence
of
freedom
in
kansas
the
battle
of
freedom
he
exclaims
in
a
vehement
plea
for
what
may
be
called
moderate
as
against
radical
policy
is
to
be
fought
out
on
principle
slavery
is
violation
of
eternal
right
we
have
temporised
with
it
from
the
necessities
of
our
condition
but
as
sure
as
god
reigns
and
school
children
read
that
black
foul
lie
can
never
be
consecrated
into
god
hallowed
truth
in
other
words
the
sure
way
and
the
only
way
to
combat
slavery
lay
in
the
firm
and
the
scrupulous
assertion
of
principles
which
would
carry
the
reason
and
the
conscience
of
the
people
with
them
the
repeal
of
the
prohibition
of
slavery
in
the
territories
was
a
defiance
of
such
principles
but
so
too
in
its
way
was
the
disregard
by
abolitionists
of
the
rights
covenanted
to
the
slave
states
this
side
of
lincoln
doctrine
is
apt
to
jar
upon
us
we
feel
with
a
great
american
historian
that
the
north
would
have
been
depraved
indeed
if
it
had
not
bred
abolitionists
and
it
requires
an
effort
to
sympathise
with
lincoln
rigidly
correct
feeling
sometimes
harshly
expressed
and
sometimes
apparently
cold
it
is
not
possible
to
us
as
it
was
to
him
a
little
later
to
look
on
john
brown
adventure
merely
as
a
crime
nor
can
we
wonder
that
when
he
was
president
and
civil
war
was
raging
many
good
men
in
the
north
mistook
him
and
thought
him
because
he
persisted
in
his
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
slave
states
so
long
as
there
seemed
to
be
a
chance
of
saving
the
union
in
that
way
it
was
his
primary
business
he
then
said
to
save
the
union
if
he
could
if
i
could
save
the
union
by
emancipating
all
the
slaves
i
would
do
so
if
i
could
save
it
by
emancipating
none
of
them
i
would
do
it
if
i
could
save
it
by
emancipating
some
and
not
others
i
would
do
that
too
but
as
in
the
letter
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
he
called
speed
to
witness
his
forbearance
with
slavery
cost
him
real
pain
and
we
shall
misread
both
his
policy
as
president
and
his
character
as
a
man
if
we
fail
to
see
that
in
the
bottom
of
his
mind
he
felt
this
forbearance
to
be
required
by
the
very
same
principles
which
roused
him
against
the
extension
of
the
evil
years
before
he
had
written
to
an
abolitionist
correspondent
that
respect
for
the
rights
of
the
slave
states
was
due
not
only
to
the
constitution
but
as
it
seems
to
me
in
a
sense
to
freedom
itself
negro
slavery
was
not
the
only
important
issue
nor
was
it
an
isolated
issue
what
really
was
in
issue
was
the
continuance
of
the
nation
dedicated
as
he
said
on
a
great
occasion
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
equal
a
nation
founded
by
the
union
of
communities
some
of
which
lagged
far
behind
the
others
in
applying
in
their
own
midst
the
elementary
principles
of
freedom
but
yet
a
nation
actuated
from
its
very
foundation
in
some
important
respects
by
the
acknowledgment
of
human
rights
the
practical
policy
then
on
which
his
whole
efforts
were
concentrated
consisted
in
this
single
point
the
express
recognition
of
the
essential
evil
of
slavery
by
the
enactment
that
it
should
not
spread
further
in
the
territories
subject
to
the
union
if
slavery
were
thus
shut
up
within
a
ring
fence
and
marked
as
a
wrong
thing
which
the
union
as
a
whole
might
tolerate
but
would
not
be
a
party
to
emancipation
in
the
slave
states
would
follow
in
course
of
time
it
would
come
about
lincoln
certainly
thought
in
a
way
far
better
for
the
slaves
as
well
as
for
their
masters
than
any
forced
liberation
he
was
content
to
wait
for
it
i
do
not
mean
that
when
it
takes
a
turn
towards
ultimate
extinction
it
will
be
in
a
day
nor
in
a
year
nor
in
two
years
i
do
not
suppose
that
in
the
most
peaceful
way
ultimate
extinction
would
occur
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
at
least
but
that
it
will
occur
in
the
best
way
for
both
races
in
god
own
good
time
i
have
no
doubt
if
we
wonder
whether
this
policy
if
soon
enough
adopted
by
the
union
as
a
whole
would
really
have
brought
on
emancipation
in
the
south
the
best
answer
is
that
when
the
policy
did
receive
national
sanction
by
the
election
of
lincoln
the
principal
slave
states
themselves
instinctively
recognised
it
as
fatal
to
slavery
for
the
extinction
of
slavery
he
would
wait
for
a
decision
on
the
principle
of
slavery
he
would
not
it
was
idle
to
protest
against
agitation
of
the
question
if
politicians
would
be
silent
that
would
not
get
rid
of
this
same
mighty
power
that
somehow
operates
on
the
minds
of
men
exciting
them
and
stirring
them
up
in
every
avenue
of
society
in
politics
in
religion
in
literature
in
morals
in
all
the
manifold
relations
of
life
the
stand
temperate
as
it
was
that
he
advocated
against
slavery
should
be
taken
at
once
and
finally
the
difference
of
which
people
grown
accustomed
to
slavery
among
their
neighbours
thought
little
between
letting
it
be
in
missouri
which
they
could
not
help
and
letting
it
cross
the
border
into
kansas
which
they
could
help
appeared
to
lincoln
the
whole
tremendous
gulf
between
right
and
wrong
between
a
wise
patience
with
ills
they
could
not
cure
and
a
profligate
acceptance
of
evil
as
their
good
and
here
there
was
a
distinction
between
lincoln
and
many
republicans
which
again
may
seem
subtle
but
which
was
really
far
wider
than
that
which
separated
him
from
the
abolitionists
slavery
must
be
stopped
from
spreading
into
kansas
not
because
as
it
turned
out
the
immigrants
into
kansas
mostly
did
not
want
it
but
because
it
was
wrong
and
the
united
states
where
they
were
free
to
act
would
not
have
it
the
greatest
evil
in
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
was
the
laxity
of
public
tone
which
had
made
it
possible
little
by
little
but
steadily
as
man
march
to
the
grave
we
have
been
giving
up
the
old
faith
for
the
new
faith
formerly
some
deference
to
the
central
idea
of
equality
was
general
and
in
some
sort
of
abstract
sense
slavery
was
admitted
to
be
wrong
now
it
was
boldly
claimed
by
the
south
that
slavery
in
the
abstract
was
right
all
the
most
powerful
influences
in
the
country
mammon
for
the
slave
property
is
worth
a
billion
dollars
fashion
philosophy
and
even
the
theology
of
the
day
were
enlisted
in
favour
of
this
opinion
and
it
met
with
no
resistance
you
yourself
may
detest
slavery
but
your
neighbour
has
five
or
six
slaves
and
he
is
an
excellent
neighbour
or
your
son
has
married
his
daughter
and
they
beg
you
to
help
save
their
property
and
you
vote
against
your
interests
and
principle
to
oblige
a
neighbour
hoping
your
vote
will
be
on
the
losing
side
and
again
the
party
lash
and
the
fear
of
ridicule
will
overawe
justice
and
liberty
for
it
is
a
singular
fact
but
none
the
less
a
fact
and
well
known
by
the
most
common
experience
that
men
will
do
things
under
the
terror
of
the
party
lash
that
they
would
not
on
any
account
or
for
any
consideration
do
otherwise
while
men
who
will
march
up
to
the
mouth
of
a
loaded
cannon
without
shrinking
will
run
from
the
terrible
name
of
even
when
pronounced
by
a
worthless
creature
whom
they
with
good
reason
despise
and
so
people
in
the
north
who
could
hardly
stomach
the
doctrine
that
slavery
was
good
yet
lapsed
into
the
feeling
that
it
was
a
thing
indifferent
a
thing
for
which
they
might
rightly
shuffle
off
their
responsibility
on
to
the
immigrants
into
kansas
this
feeling
that
it
was
indifferent
lincoln
pursued
and
chastised
with
special
scorn
but
the
principle
of
freedom
that
they
were
surrendering
was
the
principle
of
freedom
for
themselves
as
well
as
for
the
negro
the
sense
of
the
negro
rights
had
been
allowed
to
go
back
till
the
prospect
of
emancipation
for
him
looked
immeasurably
worse
than
it
had
a
generation
before
they
must
recognise
that
when
by
their
connivance
they
had
barred
and
bolted
the
door
upon
the
negro
the
spirit
of
tyranny
which
they
had
evoked
would
then
turn
and
rend
them
the
central
idea
which
had
now
established
itself
in
the
intellect
of
the
southern
was
one
which
favoured
the
enslavement
of
man
by
man
apart
from
colour
a
definite
choice
had
to
be
made
between
the
principle
of
the
fathers
which
asserted
certain
rights
for
all
men
and
that
other
principle
against
which
the
fathers
had
rebelled
and
of
which
the
divine
right
of
kings
furnished
lincoln
with
his
example
in
what
particular
manner
the
white
people
would
be
made
to
feel
the
principle
of
tyranny
when
they
had
definitely
denied
freedom
to
others
and
ceased
to
deserve
it
for
themselves
lincoln
did
not
attempt
to
say
and
perhaps
only
dimly
imagined
but
he
was
as
convinced
as
any
prophet
that
america
stood
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
must
choose
now
the
right
principle
or
the
wrong
with
all
its
consequences
the
principle
of
tyranny
presented
itself
for
their
choice
in
a
specious
form
in
douglas
great
patent
everlasting
principle
of
sovereignty
this
alleged
principle
was
likely
so
to
say
to
take
upon
their
blind
side
men
who
were
sympathetic
to
the
impatience
of
control
of
any
crowd
resembling
themselves
but
not
sympathetic
to
humanity
of
another
race
and
colour
the
claim
to
some
divine
and
indefeasible
right
of
sovereignty
overriding
all
other
considerations
of
the
general
good
on
the
part
of
a
majority
greater
or
smaller
at
any
given
time
in
any
given
area
is
one
which
can
generally
be
made
to
bear
a
liberal
semblance
though
it
certainly
has
no
necessary
validity
americans
had
never
before
thought
of
granting
it
in
the
case
of
their
outlying
and
unsettled
dominions
they
would
never
for
instance
as
lincoln
remarked
have
admitted
the
claim
of
settlers
like
the
mormons
to
make
polygamy
lawful
in
the
territory
they
occupied
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
now
employed
the
proposed
principle
could
as
lincoln
contended
be
reduced
to
this
simple
form
that
if
one
man
chooses
to
enslave
another
no
third
man
shall
have
the
right
to
object
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
how
far
lincoln
foresaw
the
strain
to
which
a
firm
stand
against
slavery
would
subject
the
union
it
is
likely
enough
that
those
worst
forebodings
for
the
union
which
events
proved
to
be
very
true
were
confined
to
timid
men
who
made
a
practice
of
yielding
to
threats
lincoln
appreciated
better
than
many
of
his
fellows
the
sentiment
of
the
south
but
it
is
often
hard
for
men
not
in
immediate
contact
with
a
school
of
thought
which
seems
to
them
thoroughly
perverse
to
appreciate
its
pervasive
power
and
lincoln
was
inclined
to
stake
much
upon
the
hope
that
reason
will
prevail
moreover
he
had
a
confidence
in
the
strength
of
the
union
which
might
have
been
justified
if
his
predecessor
in
office
had
been
a
man
of
ordinary
firmness
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
undue
hopefulness
if
he
felt
it
influenced
his
judgment
he
was
of
a
temper
which
does
not
seek
to
forecast
what
the
future
has
to
show
and
his
melancholy
prepared
him
well
for
any
evil
that
might
come
two
things
we
can
say
with
certainty
of
his
aim
and
purpose
on
the
one
hand
as
has
already
been
said
whatever
view
he
had
taken
of
the
peril
to
the
union
he
would
never
have
sought
to
avoid
the
peril
by
what
appeared
to
him
a
surrender
of
the
principle
which
gave
the
union
its
worth
on
the
other
hand
he
must
always
have
been
prepared
to
uphold
the
union
at
whatever
the
cost
might
prove
to
be
to
a
man
of
deep
and
gentle
nature
war
will
always
be
hateful
but
it
can
never
any
more
than
an
individual
death
appear
the
worst
of
evils
and
the
claim
of
the
southern
states
to
separate
from
a
community
which
to
him
was
venerable
and
to
form
a
new
nation
based
on
slavery
and
bound
to
live
in
discord
with
its
neighbors
did
not
appeal
to
him
at
all
though
in
a
certain
literal
sense
it
was
a
claim
to
liberty
his
attitude
to
any
possible
movement
for
secession
was
defined
four
years
at
least
before
secession
came
in
words
such
as
it
was
not
his
habit
to
use
without
full
sense
of
their
possible
effect
or
without
much
previous
thought
they
were
quite
simple
we
wo
break
up
the
union
and
you
sha
such
were
the
main
thoughts
which
would
be
found
to
animate
the
whole
of
lincoln
notable
campaign
beginning
with
his
first
encounter
with
douglas
in
and
culminating
in
his
prolonged
duel
with
him
in
the
autumn
of
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
follow
the
complexities
especially
in
regard
to
the
dred
scott
judgments
through
which
the
discussion
wandered
it
is
now
worth
few
men
while
to
do
more
than
glance
at
two
or
three
of
his
speeches
at
that
period
his
speeches
in
the
formal
debates
except
the
first
are
not
the
best
of
them
a
scientific
student
of
rhetoric
as
the
art
by
which
man
do
actually
persuade
crowds
might
indeed
do
well
to
watch
closely
the
use
by
douglas
and
lincoln
of
their
respective
weapons
but
for
most
of
us
it
is
an
unprofitable
business
to
read
reiterated
argument
even
though
in
beautiful
language
upon
points
of
doubt
that
no
longer
trouble
us
lincoln
does
not
always
show
to
advantage
later
readers
have
found
him
inferior
in
urbanity
to
douglas
of
whom
he
disapproved
while
douglas
probably
disapproved
of
no
man
his
speeches
are
of
course
not
free
either
from
unsound
arguments
or
from
the
rough
and
tumble
of
popular
debate
occasionally
he
uses
hackneyed
phrases
but
it
is
remarkable
that
a
hackneyed
or
a
falsely
sentimental
phrase
in
lincoln
comes
always
as
a
lapse
and
a
surprise
passages
abound
in
these
speeches
which
to
almost
any
literate
taste
are
arresting
for
the
simple
beauty
of
their
english
a
beauty
characteristic
of
one
who
had
learned
to
reason
with
euclid
and
learned
to
feel
and
to
speak
with
the
authors
of
the
bible
and
in
their
own
kind
they
were
a
classic
and
probably
unsurpassed
achievement
though
lincoln
had
to
deal
with
a
single
issue
demanding
no
great
width
of
knowledge
it
must
be
evident
that
the
passions
aroused
by
it
and
the
confused
and
shifting
state
of
public
sentiment
made
his
problem
very
subtle
and
it
was
a
rare
profundity
and
sincerity
of
thought
which
solved
it
in
his
own
mind
in
expressing
the
result
of
thought
so
far
deeper
than
that
of
most
men
he
achieved
a
clearness
of
expression
which
very
few
writers
and
those
among
the
greatest
have
excelled
he
once
during
the
presidential
election
of
wrote
to
a
supporter
of
fillmore
to
persuade
him
of
a
proposition
which
must
seem
paradoxical
to
anyone
not
deeply
versed
in
american
institutions
namely
that
it
was
actually
against
fillmore
interest
to
gain
votes
from
frémont
in
illinois
he
demonstrated
his
point
but
he
was
not
always
judicious
in
his
way
of
addressing
solemn
strangers
and
in
his
rural
manner
he
concludes
his
letter
the
whole
thing
is
as
simple
as
figuring
out
the
weight
of
three
small
hogs
and
this
inelegant
sentence
conveys
with
little
exaggeration
one
especial
merit
of
his
often
austerely
graceful
language
grave
difficulties
are
handled
in
a
style
which
could
arouse
all
the
interest
of
a
boy
and
penetrate
the
understanding
of
a
party
man
but
if
in
comparison
with
the
acknowledged
masterpieces
of
our
prose
we
rank
many
passages
in
these
speeches
very
high
and
in
fact
the
men
who
have
appreciated
them
most
highly
have
been
fastidious
scholars
we
shall
not
yet
have
measured
lincoln
effort
and
performance
for
these
are
not
the
compositions
of
a
cloistered
man
of
letters
they
are
the
outpourings
of
an
agitator
upon
the
stump
the
men
who
think
hard
are
few
few
of
them
can
clothe
their
thought
in
apt
and
simple
words
very
very
few
are
those
who
in
doing
this
could
hold
the
attention
of
a
miscellaneous
and
large
crowd
popular
government
owes
that
comparative
failure
of
which
in
recent
times
we
have
taken
perhaps
exaggerated
notice
partly
to
the
blindness
of
the
polite
world
to
the
true
difficulty
and
true
value
of
work
of
this
kind
and
the
importance
which
roman
education
under
the
empire
gave
to
rhetoric
was
the
mark
not
of
deadness
but
of
the
survival
of
a
manly
public
spirit
lincoln
wisdom
had
to
utter
itself
in
a
voice
which
would
reach
the
outskirts
of
a
large
and
sometimes
excited
crowd
in
the
open
air
it
was
uttered
in
strenuous
conflict
with
a
man
whose
reputation
quite
overshadowed
his
a
person
whose
extraordinary
and
vitality
armed
him
with
an
external
charm
even
for
people
who
like
beecher
stowe
detested
his
principles
an
orator
whose
mastery
of
popular
appeal
and
of
resourceful
and
evasive
debate
was
quite
unhampered
by
any
weakness
for
the
truth
the
utterance
had
to
be
kept
up
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
for
a
quarter
of
a
year
by
a
man
too
poor
to
afford
little
comforts
travelling
from
one
crowded
inn
to
another
by
slow
trains
on
a
railway
whose
officials
paid
little
attention
to
him
while
his
more
prosperous
and
distinguished
rival
could
travel
in
comfort
and
comparative
magnificence
the
physical
strain
of
electioneering
which
is
always
considerable
its
alternation
of
feverish
excitement
with
a
lassitude
that
after
a
while
becomes
prevailing
and
intense
were
in
this
case
far
greater
and
more
prolonged
than
in
any
other
instance
recorded
of
english
or
probably
of
american
statesmen
if
upon
his
sudden
elevation
shortly
afterwards
lincoln
was
in
a
sense
an
obscure
man
raised
up
by
chance
he
was
nevertheless
a
man
who
had
accomplished
a
heroic
labour
on
the
whole
the
earthen
vessel
in
which
he
carried
his
treasure
of
clear
thought
and
clean
feelings
appears
to
have
enhanced
its
flavour
there
was
at
any
rate
nothing
outward
about
him
that
aroused
the
passion
of
envy
a
few
peculiarly
observant
men
were
immediately
impressed
with
his
distinction
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
to
the
ordinary
stranger
he
appeared
as
a
very
odd
fish
no
portraits
that
i
have
ever
seen
writes
one
do
justice
to
the
awkwardness
and
ungainliness
of
his
figure
its
movements
when
he
began
to
speak
rather
added
to
its
ungainliness
and
though
to
a
trained
actor
his
elocution
seemed
perfect
his
voice
when
he
first
opened
his
mouth
surprised
and
jarred
upon
the
hearers
with
a
harsh
note
of
curiously
high
pitch
but
it
was
the
sort
of
oddity
that
arrests
attention
and
people
attention
once
caught
was
apt
to
be
held
by
the
transparent
earnestness
soon
as
he
lost
thought
of
himself
in
his
subject
his
voice
and
manner
changed
deeper
notes
of
which
friends
record
the
beauty
rang
out
the
sad
eyes
kindled
and
the
tall
gaunt
figure
with
the
strange
gesture
of
the
long
uplifted
arms
acquired
even
a
certain
majesty
hearers
recalled
afterwards
with
evident
sincerity
the
deep
and
instantaneous
impression
of
some
appeal
to
simple
conscience
as
when
reaching
his
hands
towards
the
stars
of
that
still
night
he
proclaimed
in
some
things
she
is
certainly
not
my
equal
but
in
her
natural
right
to
eat
the
bread
that
she
has
earned
with
the
sweat
of
her
brow
she
is
my
equal
and
the
equal
of
judge
douglas
and
the
equal
of
any
man
indeed
upon
a
sympathetic
audience
already
excited
by
the
occasion
he
could
produce
an
effect
which
the
reader
of
his
recorded
speeches
would
hardly
believe
of
his
speech
at
an
early
state
convention
of
the
republican
party
there
is
no
report
except
that
after
a
few
sentences
every
reporter
laid
down
his
pen
for
the
opposite
of
the
usual
reason
and
as
he
proceeded
the
audience
arose
from
their
chairs
and
with
pale
faces
and
quivering
lips
pressed
unconsciously
towards
him
and
of
his
speech
on
another
similar
occasion
several
witnesses
seem
to
have
left
descriptions
hardly
less
incongruous
with
english
experience
of
public
meetings
if
we
credit
him
with
these
occasional
manifestations
of
electric
oratory
as
to
which
it
is
certain
that
his
quiet
temperament
did
at
times
blaze
out
in
a
surprising
fashion
it
is
not
to
be
thought
that
he
was
ordinarily
what
could
be
called
eloquent
some
of
his
speeches
are
commonplace
enough
and
much
of
his
debating
with
douglas
is
of
a
drily
argumentative
kind
that
does
honour
to
the
mass
meetings
which
heard
it
gladly
but
the
greatest
gift
of
the
orator
he
did
possess
the
personality
behind
the
words
was
felt
beyond
and
above
all
skill
says
the
editor
of
a
great
paper
who
heard
him
at
peoria
was
the
overwhelming
conviction
imposed
upon
the
audience
that
the
speaker
himself
was
charged
with
an
irresistible
and
inspiring
duty
to
his
fellow
men
one
fact
about
the
method
of
his
speaking
is
easily
detected
in
debate
at
least
he
had
no
use
for
perorations
and
the
reader
who
looks
for
them
will
often
find
that
lincoln
just
used
up
the
last
few
minutes
in
clearing
up
some
unimportant
point
which
he
wanted
to
explain
only
if
there
was
time
for
it
we
associate
our
older
parliamentary
oratory
with
an
art
which
keeps
the
hearer
pleasedly
expectant
rather
than
dangerously
attentive
through
an
argument
which
if
dwelt
upon
might
prove
unsubstantial
secure
that
it
all
leads
in
the
end
to
some
great
cadence
of
noble
sound
but
in
argumentative
speeches
the
employment
of
beautiful
words
is
least
sparing
at
the
beginning
or
when
he
passes
to
a
new
subject
it
seems
as
if
he
deliberately
used
up
his
rhetorical
effects
at
the
outset
to
put
his
audience
in
the
temper
in
which
they
would
earnestly
follow
him
and
to
challenge
their
full
attention
to
reasoning
which
was
to
satisfy
their
calmer
judgment
he
put
himself
in
a
position
in
which
if
his
argument
were
not
sound
nothing
could
save
his
speech
from
failure
as
a
speech
perhaps
no
standing
epithet
of
praise
hangs
with
such
a
weight
on
a
man
reputation
as
the
epithet
honest
when
the
man
is
proved
not
to
be
a
fraud
it
suggests
a
very
mediocre
virtue
but
the
method
by
which
lincoln
actually
confirmed
his
early
won
and
dangerous
reputation
of
honesty
was
a
positive
and
potent
performance
of
rare
distinction
it
is
no
mean
intellectual
and
spiritual
achievement
to
be
as
honest
in
speech
with
a
crowd
as
in
the
dearest
intercourse
of
life
it
is
not
of
course
pretended
that
he
never
used
a
fallacious
argument
or
made
an
unfair
score
he
was
entirely
human
but
this
is
the
testimony
of
an
illinois
political
to
lincoln
he
was
one
of
the
shrewdest
politicians
in
the
state
nobody
had
more
experience
in
that
way
nobody
knew
better
what
was
passing
in
the
minds
of
the
people
nobody
knew
better
how
to
turn
things
to
advantage
politically
and
then
he
goes
on
and
this
is
really
the
sum
of
what
is
to
be
said
of
his
oratory
he
could
not
cheat
people
out
of
their
votes
any
more
than
he
could
out
of
their
money
against
it
has
now
to
be
told
how
the
contest
with
douglas
which
concluded
lincoln
labours
in
illinois
affected
the
broad
stream
of
political
events
in
america
as
a
whole
lincoln
as
we
know
was
still
only
a
local
personage
illinois
is
a
state
bigger
than
ireland
but
it
is
only
a
little
part
and
was
still
a
rather
raw
and
provincial
part
of
the
united
states
but
douglas
had
for
years
been
a
national
personage
for
a
time
the
greatest
man
among
the
democrats
and
now
for
a
reason
which
did
him
honour
he
was
in
disgrace
with
many
of
his
party
and
on
the
point
of
becoming
the
hero
of
all
moderate
republicans
we
need
not
follow
in
much
detail
the
events
of
the
great
political
world
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
threw
it
into
a
ferment
which
the
continuing
disorders
in
kansas
were
in
themselves
sufficient
to
keep
up
new
great
names
were
being
made
in
debate
in
the
senate
seward
the
most
powerful
opponent
of
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
kept
his
place
as
the
foremost
man
in
the
republican
party
not
by
consistency
in
the
stand
that
he
made
but
by
his
mastery
of
new
york
political
machinery
sumner
of
massachusetts
the
friend
of
john
bright
kept
up
a
continual
protest
for
freedom
in
turgid
scholarly
harangues
which
caught
the
spirit
of
cicero
philippics
most
successfully
in
their
personal
offensiveness
powerful
voices
in
literature
and
the
press
were
heard
upon
the
same
side
the
york
edited
by
horace
greeley
acquired
as
far
as
a
paper
in
so
large
a
country
can
a
national
importance
broadly
it
may
be
said
that
the
stirring
intellect
of
america
old
and
young
was
with
the
republicans
it
is
a
pleasant
trifle
to
note
that
longfellow
gave
up
a
visit
to
europe
to
vote
for
frémont
as
president
and
we
know
the
views
of
motley
and
of
lowell
and
of
darwin
fellow
labourer
asa
gray
but
fashion
and
that
better
and
quite
different
influence
the
tone
of
opinion
prevailing
in
the
pleasantest
society
inclined
always
to
the
southern
view
of
every
question
and
these
influences
were
nowhere
more
felt
than
among
washington
politicians
a
strong
and
respectable
group
of
southern
senators
of
whom
jefferson
davis
was
the
strongest
were
the
real
driving
power
of
the
administration
convivial
president
pierce
and
doting
president
buchanan
after
him
were
complaisant
to
their
least
scrupulous
suggestions
in
a
degree
hardly
credible
of
honourable
men
who
were
not
themselves
southerners
one
famous
incident
of
life
in
congress
must
be
told
to
explain
the
temper
of
the
times
in
during
one
of
the
many
debates
that
arose
out
of
kansas
sumner
recited
in
the
senate
a
speech
conscientiously
calculated
to
sting
the
senators
to
madness
sumner
was
a
man
with
brains
and
with
courage
and
rectitude
beyond
praise
set
off
by
a
powerful
and
noble
frame
but
he
lacked
every
minor
quality
of
greatness
he
would
not
call
his
opponent
in
debate
a
skunk
but
he
would
expend
great
verbal
ingenuity
in
coupling
his
name
with
repeated
references
to
that
animal
attributes
on
this
occasion
he
used
to
the
full
both
the
finer
and
the
most
exquisitely
tasteless
qualities
of
his
eloquence
this
sort
of
thing
passed
the
censorship
of
many
excellent
northern
men
who
would
lament
lack
of
refinement
and
though
from
first
to
last
the
serious
provocation
in
their
disputes
lay
in
the
set
policy
of
the
southern
leaders
it
ought
to
be
realised
that
they
men
who
for
the
most
part
were
quite
kind
to
their
slaves
and
had
long
ago
argued
themselves
out
of
any
compunction
about
slavery
were
often
exposed
to
intense
verbal
provocation
nevertheless
what
followed
on
sumner
speech
is
terribly
significant
of
the
depravation
of
southern
honour
congressman
preston
brooks
of
south
carolina
had
an
uncle
in
the
senate
south
carolina
and
this
senator
in
particular
had
been
specially
favoured
with
insolence
in
sumner
speech
a
day
or
so
later
the
senate
had
just
risen
and
sumner
sat
writing
at
his
desk
in
the
senate
chamber
in
a
position
in
which
he
could
not
quickly
rise
brooks
walked
in
burning
with
piety
towards
his
state
and
his
uncle
and
in
the
presence
it
seems
of
southern
senators
who
could
have
stopped
him
beat
sumner
on
the
head
with
a
stick
with
all
his
might
sumner
was
incapacitated
by
injuries
to
his
spine
for
nearly
five
years
brooks
with
a
virtuous
air
explained
in
congress
that
he
had
caught
sumner
in
a
helpless
attitude
because
if
sumner
had
been
free
to
use
his
superior
strength
he
brooks
would
have
had
to
shoot
him
with
his
revolver
it
seems
to
be
hardly
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
whole
south
applauded
brooks
and
exulted
exuberant
southerners
took
to
challenging
northern
men
knowing
well
that
their
principles
compelled
them
to
refuse
duels
but
that
the
refusal
would
still
be
humiliating
to
the
north
brooks
himself
challenged
burlingame
a
distinguished
congressman
afterwards
sent
by
lincoln
as
minister
to
china
who
had
denounced
him
burlingame
accepted
and
his
second
arranged
for
a
rifle
duel
at
a
wild
spot
across
the
frontier
at
niagara
brooks
then
drew
back
he
alleged
perhaps
sincerely
that
he
would
have
been
murdered
on
his
way
through
the
northern
states
but
northern
people
were
a
little
solaced
the
whole
disgusting
story
contains
only
one
pleasant
incident
preston
brooks
who
after
numbers
of
congratulations
testimonials
and
presentations
died
within
a
year
of
his
famous
exploit
had
first
confessed
himself
tired
of
being
a
hero
to
every
vulgar
bully
in
the
south
now
though
this
dangerous
temper
burned
steadily
in
the
south
and
there
were
always
sturdy
republicans
ready
to
provoke
it
and
questions
arising
out
of
slavery
would
constantly
recur
to
disturb
high
political
circles
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
opinion
in
the
north
the
growing
and
bustling
portion
of
the
states
would
remain
for
years
excited
about
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
in
minds
were
agitated
by
a
great
commercial
depression
and
collapse
of
credit
and
in
there
took
place
one
of
the
most
curious
for
it
would
seem
to
have
deserved
this
cold
description
of
evanescent
religious
revivals
meanwhile
by
the
actual
bloodshed
in
kansas
had
come
to
an
end
under
the
administration
of
an
able
governor
the
enormous
majority
of
settlers
in
kansas
were
now
known
to
be
against
slavery
and
it
was
probably
assumed
that
the
legalisation
of
slavery
could
not
be
forced
upon
them
prohibition
of
slavery
there
by
congress
thus
began
to
seem
needless
and
the
dred
scott
judgments
raised
at
least
a
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
possible
thus
enthusiasm
for
the
original
platform
of
the
republicans
was
cooling
down
and
to
the
further
embarrassment
of
that
party
when
towards
the
end
of
the
southern
leaders
attempted
a
legislative
outrage
the
great
champion
of
the
northern
protest
was
not
a
republican
but
douglas
himself
a
convention
had
been
elected
in
kansas
to
frame
a
state
constitution
it
represented
only
a
fraction
of
the
people
since
for
some
reason
good
or
bad
the
opponents
of
slavery
did
not
vote
in
the
election
but
it
was
understood
that
whatever
constitution
was
framed
would
be
submitted
to
the
popular
vote
the
convention
framed
a
constitution
legalising
slavery
and
its
proposals
came
before
congress
backed
by
the
influence
of
buchanan
under
them
the
people
of
kansas
were
to
vote
whether
they
would
have
this
constitution
as
it
stood
or
have
it
with
the
legalisation
of
slavery
restricted
to
the
slaves
who
had
then
been
brought
into
the
territory
no
opportunity
was
to
be
given
them
of
rejecting
the
constitution
altogether
though
governor
walker
himself
in
favor
of
slavery
assured
the
president
that
they
wished
to
do
so
ultimately
by
way
of
concession
to
vehement
resistance
the
majority
in
congress
passed
an
act
under
which
the
people
in
kansas
were
to
vote
simply
for
or
against
the
slavery
constitution
as
it
stood
only
if
they
voted
for
it
they
as
a
state
were
to
be
rewarded
with
a
large
grant
of
public
lands
belonging
to
the
union
in
their
territory
eventually
the
kansas
people
unmoved
by
this
bribe
rejected
the
constitution
by
a
majority
of
more
than
to
now
the
southern
leaders
three
years
before
had
eagerly
joined
with
douglas
to
claim
a
right
of
free
choice
for
the
kansas
people
the
shamelessness
of
this
attempt
to
trick
them
out
of
it
is
more
significant
even
than
the
tale
of
preston
brooks
there
was
no
hot
blood
there
the
affair
was
quietly
plotted
by
respected
leaders
of
the
south
they
were
men
in
many
ways
of
character
and
honour
understood
by
weak
men
like
buchanan
to
represent
the
best
traditions
of
american
public
life
but
as
they
showed
also
in
other
instances
that
can
not
be
related
here
slavery
had
become
for
them
a
sacred
cause
which
hallowed
almost
any
means
it
is
essential
to
remember
this
in
trying
to
understand
the
then
political
situation
douglas
here
behaved
very
honourably
he
with
his
cause
of
popular
sovereignty
could
not
have
afforded
to
identify
himself
with
the
fraud
on
kansas
but
he
was
a
good
enough
trickster
to
have
made
his
protest
safely
if
he
had
cared
to
do
so
as
it
was
he
braved
the
hatred
of
buchanan
and
the
fury
of
his
southern
friends
by
instant
manly
courageous
and
continued
opposition
it
may
therefore
seem
an
ungracious
thing
that
immediately
after
this
lincoln
should
have
accepted
the
invitation
of
his
friends
to
oppose
douglas
to
most
of
the
leading
republicans
out
of
illinois
it
seemed
altogether
unwise
and
undesirable
that
their
party
which
had
seemed
to
be
losing
ground
should
do
anything
but
welcome
douglas
as
an
ally
of
these
seward
indeed
went
too
far
for
his
friends
and
in
his
sanguine
hope
that
it
would
work
for
freedom
was
ready
to
submit
to
the
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
but
except
the
austere
chase
now
governor
of
ohio
who
this
once
but
unfortunately
not
again
was
with
lincoln
the
republican
leaders
in
the
east
and
great
republican
journals
like
the
tribune
declared
their
wish
that
douglas
should
be
why
then
did
lincoln
stand
against
him
it
has
often
been
suggested
that
his
personal
feelings
towards
douglas
played
some
part
in
the
matter
though
no
one
thinks
they
played
the
chief
part
probably
they
did
play
a
part
and
it
is
a
relief
to
think
that
lincoln
thoroughly
gratified
some
minor
feelings
in
this
contest
lincoln
no
doubt
enjoyed
measuring
himself
against
other
men
and
it
was
galling
to
his
ambition
to
have
been
so
completely
outstripped
by
a
man
inferior
to
him
in
every
power
except
that
of
rapid
success
he
had
also
the
deepest
distrust
for
douglas
as
a
politician
thinking
that
he
had
neither
principle
nor
scruple
though
herndon
who
knew
declares
he
neither
distrusted
nor
had
cause
to
distrust
douglas
in
his
professional
dealings
as
a
lawyer
he
had
by
the
way
one
definite
if
trifling
score
to
wipe
off
after
their
joint
debate
at
peoria
in
douglas
finding
him
hard
to
tackle
suggested
to
lincoln
that
they
should
both
undertake
to
make
no
more
speeches
for
the
present
lincoln
oddly
assented
at
once
perhaps
for
no
better
reason
than
a
ridiculous
difficulty
to
which
he
once
confessed
in
refusing
any
request
whatever
lincoln
of
course
had
kept
this
agreement
strictly
while
douglas
had
availed
himself
of
the
first
temptation
to
break
it
thus
on
all
grounds
we
may
be
sure
that
lincoln
took
pleasure
in
now
opposing
douglas
but
to
go
further
and
say
that
the
two
men
cordially
hated
each
other
is
probably
to
misread
both
there
is
no
necessary
connection
between
a
keen
desire
to
beat
a
man
and
any
sort
of
malignity
towards
him
that
much
at
least
may
be
learned
in
english
schools
and
the
whole
history
of
his
dealing
with
men
shows
that
in
some
school
or
other
lincoln
had
learned
it
very
thoroughly
douglas
too
though
an
unscrupulous
was
not
we
may
guess
an
ungenerous
man
but
the
main
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
lincoln
would
have
turned
traitor
to
his
rooted
convictions
if
he
had
not
stood
up
and
fought
douglas
even
at
this
moment
when
douglas
was
deserving
of
some
sympathy
douglas
it
must
be
observed
had
simply
acted
on
his
principle
that
the
question
between
slavery
and
freedom
was
to
be
settled
by
local
popular
choice
he
claimed
for
the
white
men
of
kansas
the
fair
opportunity
of
voting
given
that
he
persistently
declared
i
do
not
care
whether
slavery
be
voted
up
or
voted
down
in
lincoln
settled
opinion
this
moral
attitude
of
indifference
to
the
wrongfulness
of
slavery
so
long
as
respect
was
had
to
the
liberties
of
the
privileged
race
was
so
to
say
treason
to
the
basic
principle
of
the
american
commonwealth
a
treason
which
had
steadily
been
becoming
rife
and
upon
which
it
was
time
to
stamp
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
his
earnestness
about
this
but
the
republican
leaders
honourably
enough
regarded
this
as
an
unpractical
line
to
take
and
indeed
to
the
political
historian
this
is
the
most
crucial
question
in
american
history
nobody
can
say
that
civil
war
would
or
would
not
have
occurred
if
this
or
that
had
been
done
a
little
differently
but
abraham
lincoln
at
this
crisis
of
his
life
did
in
pursuance
of
his
peculiarly
cherished
principle
forge
at
least
a
link
in
the
chain
of
events
which
actually
precipitated
the
war
and
he
did
it
knowing
better
than
any
other
man
that
he
was
doing
something
of
great
national
importance
involving
at
least
great
national
risk
was
he
pursuing
his
principles
moderate
as
they
were
in
the
original
conception
with
fanaticism
or
at
the
best
preferring
a
solemn
consistency
of
theory
to
the
conscientious
handling
of
facts
not
reducible
to
theory
as
a
question
of
practical
statesmanship
in
the
largest
sense
how
did
matters
really
stand
in
regard
to
slavery
and
to
the
relations
between
south
and
north
and
what
was
lincoln
idea
of
putting
slavery
back
where
the
fathers
placed
it
really
worth
herndon
in
these
days
went
east
to
try
to
enlist
the
support
of
the
great
men
for
lincoln
he
found
them
friendly
but
immovable
editor
horace
greeley
said
to
him
the
republican
standard
is
too
high
we
want
something
practical
this
we
may
be
pretty
sure
stiffened
lincoln
back
as
a
man
with
a
cause
that
he
cared
for
and
for
that
matter
as
a
really
shrewd
manager
in
a
party
which
he
thought
stood
for
something
it
reveals
the
flabbiness
which
the
northerners
were
in
danger
of
making
a
governing
tradition
of
policy
the
wrongfulness
of
any
extension
of
slavery
might
be
loudly
asserted
in
but
in
when
it
no
longer
looked
as
if
so
great
an
extension
of
it
was
really
imminent
there
was
no
harm
in
shifting
towards
some
less
provocative
principle
on
which
more
people
at
the
moment
might
agree
confronted
with
northern
politicians
who
would
reason
in
this
fashion
stood
a
united
south
whose
leaders
were
by
now
accustomed
to
make
the
union
government
go
which
way
they
chose
and
had
no
sort
of
disposition
to
compromise
their
principle
in
the
least
what
as
lincoln
put
it
in
an
address
given
not
long
after
his
contest
with
douglas
at
the
cooper
institute
in
new
york
what
do
you
think
will
content
the
south
nothing
he
answered
but
an
acknowledgment
that
slavery
is
right
holding
as
they
do
that
slavery
is
morally
right
and
socially
elevating
they
can
not
cease
to
demand
a
full
national
recognition
of
it
as
a
legal
right
and
a
social
blessing
nor
can
we
justifiably
withhold
this
on
any
ground
save
our
conviction
that
slavery
is
wrong
that
being
so
there
was
no
use
he
said
in
groping
about
for
some
middle
ground
between
right
and
wrong
or
in
a
policy
of
on
a
question
about
which
all
true
men
do
care
and
there
is
ample
evidence
that
he
understood
rightly
the
policy
of
the
south
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
any
large
extension
of
cultivation
by
slave
labour
was
economically
possible
in
kansas
or
in
regions
yet
further
north
but
we
have
seen
to
what
lengths
the
southern
leaders
would
go
in
the
attempt
to
secure
even
a
limited
recognition
of
slavery
as
lawful
in
a
new
state
they
were
not
succeeding
in
the
business
of
the
kansas
constitution
but
they
had
a
very
good
prospect
of
a
far
more
important
success
the
celebrated
dicta
of
chief
justice
taney
and
other
judges
in
the
dred
scott
case
had
not
amounted
to
an
actual
decision
nor
if
they
had
would
a
single
decision
have
been
irreversible
whether
the
principle
of
them
should
become
fixed
in
american
constitutional
law
depended
though
this
could
not
be
openly
said
on
whether
future
appointments
to
the
supreme
court
were
to
be
made
by
a
president
who
shared
taney
views
whether
the
executive
action
of
the
president
was
governed
by
the
same
views
and
on
the
subtle
pressure
which
outside
opinion
does
exercise
and
in
this
case
had
surely
exercised
upon
judicial
minds
if
the
simple
principle
that
the
right
to
a
slave
is
just
one
form
of
the
ordinary
right
to
property
once
became
firmly
fixed
in
american
jurisprudence
it
is
hard
to
see
how
any
laws
prohibiting
slavery
could
have
continued
to
be
held
constitutional
except
in
states
which
were
free
states
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
of
course
a
state
like
new
york
where
slaves
were
industrially
useless
would
not
therefore
have
been
filled
with
slave
plantations
but
among
a
loyally
minded
people
the
tradition
which
reprobated
slavery
would
have
been
greatly
weakened
the
south
would
have
been
freed
from
the
sense
that
slavery
was
a
doomed
institution
if
attempts
to
plant
slavery
further
in
the
west
with
profit
failed
there
was
cuba
and
there
was
central
america
on
which
filibustering
raids
already
found
favour
in
the
south
and
in
which
the
national
government
might
be
led
to
adopt
schemes
of
conquest
or
annexation
moreover
it
was
avowed
by
leaders
like
jefferson
davis
that
though
it
might
be
impracticable
to
hope
for
the
repeal
of
the
prohibition
of
the
slave
trade
at
least
some
relaxation
of
its
severity
ought
to
be
striven
for
in
the
interest
of
texas
and
new
mexico
and
of
possible
future
territories
where
there
might
be
room
for
more
slaves
such
were
the
views
of
the
leaders
whose
influence
preponderated
with
the
present
president
and
in
the
main
with
the
present
congress
when
lincoln
judged
that
a
determined
stand
against
their
policy
was
required
and
further
that
no
such
stand
could
be
possible
to
a
party
which
had
embraced
douglas
with
his
principle
i
care
not
whether
slavery
be
voted
up
or
voted
down
there
is
no
doubt
now
that
he
was
right
and
the
great
body
of
republican
authority
opposed
to
him
wrong
when
lincoln
and
his
friends
in
illinois
determined
to
fight
douglas
it
became
impossible
for
the
republican
party
as
a
whole
to
fall
far
behind
them
this
was
in
itself
at
that
crisis
an
important
thing
lincoln
added
greatly
to
its
importance
by
the
opening
words
in
the
first
speech
of
his
campaign
they
were
the
most
carefully
prepared
words
that
he
had
yet
spoken
and
the
most
momentous
that
he
had
spoken
till
now
or
perhaps
ever
spoke
there
is
nothing
in
them
for
which
what
has
been
said
of
the
situation
and
of
his
views
will
not
have
prepared
us
and
nothing
which
thousands
of
men
might
not
have
said
to
one
another
in
private
for
a
year
or
two
before
but
the
first
public
avowal
by
a
responsible
man
in
trenchant
phrase
that
a
grave
issue
has
been
joined
upon
which
one
party
or
the
other
must
accept
entire
defeat
may
be
an
event
of
great
and
perilous
consequence
he
said
if
we
could
first
know
where
we
are
and
whither
we
are
tending
we
could
better
judge
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
we
are
now
far
into
the
fifth
year
since
a
policy
was
initiated
with
the
avowed
object
and
confident
promise
of
putting
an
end
to
slavery
agitation
under
the
operation
of
that
policy
that
agitation
has
not
only
not
ceased
but
has
constantly
augmented
in
my
opinion
it
will
not
cease
until
a
crisis
shall
have
been
reached
and
passed
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
i
do
not
expect
the
union
to
be
dissolved
i
do
not
expect
the
house
to
fall
but
i
do
expect
that
it
will
cease
to
be
divided
it
will
become
all
one
thing
or
all
the
other
either
the
opponents
of
slavery
will
arrest
the
further
spread
of
it
and
place
it
where
the
public
mind
shall
rest
in
the
belief
that
it
is
in
course
of
ultimate
extinction
or
its
advocates
will
push
it
forward
till
it
shall
become
lawful
alike
in
all
the
states
old
as
well
as
new
north
as
well
as
south
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
american
public
opinion
has
in
the
past
been
very
timid
in
facing
issues
but
as
has
already
been
observed
an
apt
phrase
crystallising
the
unspoken
thought
of
many
is
even
more
readily
caught
up
in
america
than
anywhere
else
so
though
but
few
people
in
states
at
a
distance
paid
much
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
debates
or
for
a
while
again
to
lincoln
the
comparison
of
the
house
divided
against
itself
produced
an
effect
in
the
country
which
did
not
wear
out
in
this
whole
passage
moreover
lincoln
had
certainly
formulated
the
question
before
the
nation
more
boldly
more
clearly
more
truly
than
any
one
before
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
such
influences
precisely
but
this
was
among
the
speeches
that
rank
as
important
actions
and
the
story
most
characteristic
of
the
speaker
which
lay
behind
it
is
worth
relating
in
detail
lincoln
had
actually
in
a
speech
in
declared
that
the
united
states
could
not
long
endure
half
slave
and
half
free
what
in
god
name
said
some
friend
after
the
meeting
could
induce
you
to
promulgate
such
an
opinion
upon
my
soul
he
said
i
think
it
is
true
and
he
could
not
be
argued
out
of
this
opinion
finally
the
friend
protested
that
true
or
not
no
good
could
come
of
spreading
this
opinion
abroad
and
after
grave
reflection
lincoln
promised
not
to
utter
it
again
for
the
present
now
in
having
prepared
his
speech
he
read
it
to
herndon
herndon
questioned
whether
the
passage
on
the
divided
house
was
politic
lincoln
said
i
would
rather
be
defeated
with
this
expression
in
my
speech
and
uphold
and
discuss
it
before
the
people
than
be
victorious
without
it
once
more
just
before
he
delivered
it
he
read
it
over
to
a
dozen
or
so
of
his
closest
supporters
for
it
was
his
way
to
discuss
his
intentions
fully
with
friends
sometimes
accepting
their
advice
most
submissively
and
sometimes
disregarding
it
wholly
one
said
it
was
ahead
of
its
time
another
that
it
was
a
damned
fool
utterance
all
more
or
less
strongly
condemned
it
except
this
time
herndon
who
according
to
his
recollection
said
it
will
make
you
president
he
listened
to
all
and
then
addressed
them
we
are
told
substantially
as
follows
friends
this
thing
has
been
retarded
long
enough
the
time
has
come
when
these
sentiments
should
be
uttered
and
if
it
is
decreed
that
i
should
go
down
because
of
this
speech
then
let
me
go
down
linked
to
the
truth
let
me
die
in
the
advocacy
of
what
is
just
and
right
rather
a
memorable
pronouncement
of
a
candidate
to
his
committee
and
the
man
who
records
it
is
insistent
upon
every
little
illustration
he
can
find
both
of
cunning
and
of
his
ambition
lincoln
did
go
down
in
this
particular
contest
many
friends
wrote
and
reproved
him
after
this
damned
fool
utterance
but
his
defeat
was
not
after
all
attributed
to
that
all
the
same
he
did
himself
assure
his
defeat
and
he
did
it
with
extraordinary
skill
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
the
next
president
should
be
a
republican
president
though
it
is
impossible
he
should
at
that
time
have
counted
upon
being
himself
that
republican
each
candidate
had
undertaken
to
answer
set
questions
which
his
opponent
might
propound
to
him
and
great
public
attention
was
paid
to
the
answers
to
these
interrogatories
the
dred
scott
judgments
created
a
great
difficulty
for
douglas
he
was
bound
to
treat
them
as
right
but
if
they
were
right
and
congress
had
no
power
to
prohibit
slavery
in
a
territory
neither
could
a
territorial
legislature
with
authority
delegated
by
congress
have
that
power
and
if
this
were
made
clear
it
would
seem
there
was
an
end
of
that
free
choice
of
the
people
in
the
territories
of
which
douglas
had
been
the
great
advocate
douglas
would
use
all
his
evasive
skill
in
keeping
away
from
this
difficult
point
if
however
he
could
be
forced
to
face
it
lincoln
knew
what
he
would
say
he
would
say
that
slavery
would
not
be
actually
unlawful
in
a
territory
but
would
never
actually
exist
in
it
if
the
territorial
legislature
chose
to
abstain
as
it
could
from
passing
any
of
the
laws
which
would
in
practice
be
necessary
to
protect
slave
property
by
advocating
this
view
douglas
would
fully
reassure
those
of
his
former
supporters
in
illinois
who
puzzled
themselves
on
the
dred
scott
case
but
he
would
infuriate
the
south
lincoln
determined
to
force
douglas
into
this
position
by
the
questions
which
he
challenged
him
to
answer
when
he
told
his
friends
of
his
ambition
they
all
told
him
he
would
lose
his
election
gentlemen
said
lincoln
i
am
killing
larger
game
if
douglas
answers
he
can
never
be
president
and
the
battle
of
is
worth
a
hundred
of
this
the
south
was
already
angry
with
douglas
for
his
action
over
the
kansas
constitution
but
he
would
have
been
an
invincible
candidate
for
the
south
to
support
in
and
it
must
have
told
in
his
favour
that
his
offence
then
had
been
one
of
plain
honesty
but
in
this
fresh
offence
the
southern
leaders
had
some
cause
to
accuse
him
of
double
dealing
and
they
swore
he
should
not
be
president
a
majority
of
the
new
illinois
legislature
returned
douglas
to
the
senate
lincoln
however
had
an
actual
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
whole
state
probably
also
he
had
gained
a
hold
on
illinois
for
the
future
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
actual
number
of
votes
then
given
against
the
popular
douglas
and
above
all
he
had
gathered
to
him
a
band
of
supporters
who
had
unbounded
belief
in
him
but
his
fall
for
the
moment
was
little
noticed
or
regretted
outside
illinois
or
at
any
rate
in
the
great
eastern
states
to
which
illinois
was
so
to
speak
the
provinces
and
he
a
provincial
attorney
his
first
words
in
the
campaign
had
made
a
stir
but
the
rest
of
his
speeches
in
these
long
debates
could
not
be
much
noticed
at
a
distance
douglas
had
won
and
the
presumption
was
that
he
had
proved
himself
the
better
man
lincoln
had
performed
what
apart
from
results
was
a
work
of
intellectual
merit
beyond
the
compass
of
any
american
statesman
since
hamilton
moreover
as
can
now
be
seen
there
had
been
great
results
for
first
the
young
republican
party
had
not
capitulated
and
collapsed
and
then
the
great
democratic
party
established
in
power
in
indifference
and
in
complicity
with
wrong
was
split
clean
in
two
but
these
were
not
results
that
could
be
read
yet
awhile
in
election
figures
meanwhile
the
exhausted
lincoln
reconciled
himself
for
the
moment
to
failure
as
a
private
man
he
was
thoroughly
content
that
he
could
soon
work
off
his
debt
for
his
election
expenses
could
earn
about
pounds
a
year
and
be
secure
in
the
possession
of
the
little
house
and
the
pounds
capital
which
was
as
much
as
any
man
ought
to
have
as
a
public
man
he
was
sadly
proud
that
he
had
at
least
said
some
words
which
may
bear
fruit
after
i
am
forgotten
persistent
melancholy
and
incurable
elasticity
can
go
together
and
they
make
a
very
strong
combination
the
tone
of
resignation
had
not
passed
away
from
his
comparatively
intimate
letters
when
he
was
writing
little
notes
to
one
political
acquaintance
and
another
inciting
them
to
look
forward
to
the
fun
of
the
next
fight
for
the
next
few
months
the
excitements
of
the
great
political
world
concern
this
biography

there

between
davis
and

a
meeting

against
slavery

regained
courage
from
the
occasion
and
roused
the
north
with
grave
and
earnest
words
about
the
irrepressible
conflict

or
chain
of

houses

which

literally

bravest
of

who
stood
out
for
fair
treatment
to
kansas
a
duel
in
which
he
might
fairly
be
said
to
have
been
murdered
the
one
event
which
demands
more
than
allusion
was
the
raid
and
the
death
of
john
brown
john
brown
in
whom
puritan
religion
as
strict
as
that
of
his
ancestors
on
the
put
forth
gentler
beauties
of
character
than
his
sanguinary
mission
may
suggest
had
been
somewhat
of
a
failure
as
a
scientific
farmer
but
as
a
leader
of
fighting
men
in
desperate
adventure
only
such
men
as
drake
or
garibaldi
seem
to
have
excelled
him
more
particularly
in
the
commotions
in
kansas
he
had
led
forays
slain
ruthlessly
witnesses
the
deaths
of
several
of
his
tall
strong
sons
and
as
a
rule
earned
success
by
cool
judgment
all
as
he
was
absolutely
sure
at
the
clear
call
of
god
in
october
how
and
with
whose
help
the
stroke
was
prepared
seems
to
be
a
question
of
some
mystery
john
brown
gathering
a
little
band
of
abolitionists
and
negroes
invaded
the
slave
states
and
seized
the
united
states
arsenal
at
harper
ferry
in
virginia
in
the
details
which
do
not
matter
of
this
tiny
campaign
john
brown
seems
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
have
blundered
badly
this
was
the
only
thing
that
lay
upon
his
conscience
towards
the
last
what
manner
of
success
he
can
have
expected
does
not
appear
most
likely
he
had
neither
care
nor
definite
expectation
as
to
the
result
the
united
states
troops
under
robert
lee
soon
to
be
famous
of
course
overcame
him
quickly
one
of
his
prisoners
describes
how
he
held
out
to
the
last
a
dead
son
beside
him
one
hand
on
the
pulse
of
a
dying
son
his
rifle
in
the
other
he
was
captured
desperately
wounded
southerners
could
not
believe
the
fact
that
brown
had
not
contemplated
some
hideous
uprising
of
slaves
against
their
wives
and
children
but
he
only
wished
to
conquer
them
with
the
sword
of
the
lord
and
of
gideon
quietly
freeing
slaves
as
he
went
so
naturally
there
was
talk
of
lynching
but
the
virginian
gentlemen
concerned
would
not
have
that
governor
wise
of
virginia
had
some
talk
with
him
and
justified
his
own
high
character
rather
than
by
the
estimate
he
gave
of
him
in
a
speech
at
richmond
brown
was
hanged
stonewall
jackson
a
brother
fanatic
if
that
is
the
word
felt
the
spectacle
awful
as
he
never
felt
slaughter
in
battle
and
put
up
a
prayer
that
if
possible
brown
might
be
saved
so
perish
all
foes
of
the
human
race
said
the
officer
commanding
on
the
occasion
and
the
south
generally
felt
the
like
a
little
before
his
death
brown
was
asked
how
do
you
justify
your
acts
he
said
i
think
my
friend
you
are
guilty
of
a
great
wrong
against
god
and
humanity
i
say
it
without
wishing
to
be
offensive
and
it
would
be
perfectly
right
for
any
one
to
interfere
with
you
so
far
as
to
free
those
you
wilfully
and
wickedly
hold
in
bondage
i
think
i
did
right
and
that
others
will
do
right
who
interfere
with
you
at
any
time
and
at
all
times
in
a
conversation
still
later
he
is
reported
to
have
concluded
i
wish
to
say
furthermore
that
you
had
better
all
you
people
at
the
south
prepare
yourselves
for
a
settlement
of
this
question
that
must
come
up
for
settlement
sooner
than
you
are
prepared
for
it
you
may
dispose
of
me
very
easily
i
am
nearly
disposed
of
now
but
this
question
is
still
to
be
settled
this
negro
question
i
mean
the
end
of
that
is
not
yet
to
a
friend
he
wrote
that
he
rejoiced
like
paul
because
he
knew
like
paul
that
if
they
killed
him
it
would
greatly
advance
the
cause
of
christ
lincoln
who
regarded
lawlessness
and
slavery
as
twin
evils
could
only
say
of
john
brown
raid
that
affair
in
its
philosophy
corresponds
with
the
many
attempts
related
in
history
at
the
assassination
of
kings
and
emperors
an
enthusiast
broods
over
the
oppression
of
a
people
till
he
fancies
himself
commissioned
by
heaven
to
liberate
them
he
ventures
the
attempt
which
ends
in
little
else
than
his
own
execution
orsini
attempt
on
louis
napoleon
and
john
brown
attempt
at
ferry
were
in
their
philosophy
precisely
the
same
seward
it
must
be
recorded
spoke
far
more
sympathetically
of
him
than
lincoln
and
far
more
justly
for
there
is
a
flaw
somewhere
in
this
example
as
his
chief
biographer
regards
it
of
lincoln
judgment
john
brown
had
at
least
left
to
every
northern
boy
a
memory
worth
much
in
the
coming
years
of
war
and
one
hopes
ever
after
he
had
well
deserved
to
be
the
subject
of
a
song
which
whatever
may
be
its
technical
merits
as
literature
does
stir
emerson
took
the
same
view
of
him
as
the
song
writer
and
victor
hugo
suggested
as
an
epitaph
for
him
pro
christo
sicut
christus
a
calmer
poet
longfellow
wrote
in
his
diary
on
friday
december
the
day
when
brown
was
hanged
this
will
be
a
great
day
in
our
history
the
date
of
a
new
revolution
quite
as
much
needed
as
the
old
one
even
now
as
i
write
they
are
leading
old
john
brown
to
execution
in
virginia
for
attempting
to
rescue
slaves
this
is
sowing
the
wind
to
reap
the
whirlwind
which
will
soon
come
any
one
who
is
interested
in
lincoln
is
almost
forced
to
linger
over
the
contrasting
though
slighter
character
who
crossed
the
stage
just
before
he
suddenly
took
the
principal
part
upon
it
men
like
john
brown
may
be
fitly
ranked
with
the
equally
rare
men
who
steering
a
very
different
course
have
consistently
acted
out
the
principles
of
the
quakers
constraining
no
man
whether
by
violence
or
by
law
yet
going
into
the
thick
of
life
prepared
at
all
times
to
risk
all
all
such
men
are
abnormal
in
the
sense
that
most
men
literally
could
not
put
life
through
on
any
similar
plan
and
would
be
wrong
and
foolish
to
try
the
reason
is
that
most
men
have
a
wider
range
of
sympathy
and
of
intellect
than
they
but
the
common
sense
of
most
of
us
revolts
from
any
attitude
of
condemnation
or
condescension
towards
them
for
they
are
more
disinterested
than
most
of
us
more
and
in
their
own
field
often
more
successful
with
a
very
clear
conscience
we
refuse
to
take
example
from
these
men
whose
very
defects
have
operated
in
them
as
a
special
call
but
undoubtedly
most
of
us
regard
them
with
a
warmth
of
sympathy
which
we
are
slow
to
accord
to
safer
guides
we
turn
now
from
john
brown
who
saw
in
slavery
a
great
oppression
and
was
very
angry
and
went
ahead
slaying
the
nearest
oppressor
and
liberating
for
some
days
at
least
the
nearest
slave
to
a
patient
being
who
long
ago
in
his
youth
had
boiled
with
anger
against
slavery
but
whose
whole
soul
now
expressed
itself
in
a
policy
of
deadly
moderation
towards
it
let
us
put
back
slavery
where
the
fathers
placed
it
and
there
let
it
rest
in
peace
we
are
to
study
how
he
acted
when
in
power
in
almost
every
department
of
policy
we
shall
see
him
watching
and
waiting
while
blood
flows
suspending
judgment
temporising
making
trial
of
this
expedient
and
of
that
adopting
in
the
end
quite
unthanked
the
measure
of
which
most
men
will
say
when
it
succeeds
that
is
what
we
always
said
should
be
done
above
all
in
that
point
of
policy
which
most
interests
us
we
shall
witness
the
long
postponement
of
the
blow
that
killed
negro
slavery
the
steady
subordination
of
this
particular
issue
to
what
will
not
at
once
appeal
to
us
as
a
larger
and
a
higher
issue
all
this
provoked
at
the
time
in
many
excellent
and
clever
men
dissatisfaction
and
deep
suspicion
they
longed
for
a
leader
whose
heart
visibly
glowed
with
a
sacred
passion
they
attributed
his
patience
the
one
quality
of
greatness
which
after
a
while
everybody
might
have
discerned
in
him
not
to
a
which
almost
passed
belief
but
to
a
tepid
disposition
and
a
mediocre
if
not
a
low
level
of
desire
we
who
read
of
him
shall
not
escape
our
moments
of
lively
sympathy
with
these
grumblers
of
the
time
we
shall
wish
that
this
man
could
ever
plunge
that
he
could
ever
see
red
ever
commit
some
passionate
injustice
we
shall
suspect
him
of
being
in
the
phrase
of
a
great
philosopher
a
disgustingly
person
lacking
that
indefinable
quality
akin
to
the
honest
passions
of
us
ordinary
men
but
deeper
and
stronger
which
alone
could
compel
and
could
reward
any
true
reverence
for
his
memory
these
moments
will
recur
but
they
can
not
last
a
thousand
little
things
apparent
on
the
surface
but
deeply
significant
almost
every
trivial
anecdote
of
his
boyhood
his
prime
or
his
closing
years
his
few
recorded
confidences
his
equally
few
speeches
made
under
strong
emotion
the
lineaments
of
his
face
described
by
observers
whom
photography
corroborated
all
these
absolutely
forbid
any
conception
of
abraham
lincoln
as
a
worthy
commonplace
person
fortunately
fitted
to
the
requirements
of
his
office
at
the
moment
or
as
merely
a
good
man
in
the
negative
and
disparaging
sense
to
which
that
term
is
often
wrested
it
is
really
evident
that
there
were
no
frigid
perfections
about
him
at
all
indeed
the
weakness
of
some
parts
of
his
conduct
is
so
unlike
what
seems
to
be
required
of
a
successful
ruler
that
it
is
certain
some
almost
unexampled
quality
of
heart
and
mind
went
to
the
doing
of
what
he
did
there
is
no
need
to
define
that
quality
the
general
wisdom
of
his
statesmanship
will
perhaps
appear
greater
and
its
not
infrequent
errors
less
the
more
fully
the
circumstances
are
appreciated
as
to
the
man
perhaps
the
sense
will
grow
upon
us
that
this
balanced
and
calculating
person
with
his
finger
on
the
pulse
of
the
electorate
while
he
cracked
his
uncensored
jests
with
all
comers
did
of
set
purpose
drink
and
refill
and
drink
again
as
full
and
fiery
a
cup
of
sacrifice
as
ever
was
pressed
to
the
lips
of
hero
or
of
saint
election
of
events
were
now
raising
lincoln
to
the
highest
place
which
his
ambition
could
contemplate
his
own
action
in
the
months
that
followed
his
defeat
by
douglas
can
not
have
contributed
much
to
his
surprising
elevation
yet
it
illustrates
well
his
strength
and
his
weakness
his
real
fitness
now
and
then
startlingly
revealed
for
the
highest
position
and
the
superficial
unfitness
which
long
hid
his
capacity
from
many
acute
contemporaries
in
december
he
made
a
number
of
speeches
in
kansas
and
elsewhere
in
the
west
and
in
february
he
gave
a
memorable
address
in
the
cooper
institute
in
new
york
before
as
consciously
intellectual
an
audience
as
could
be
collected
in
that
city
proceeding
afterwards
to
speak
in
several
cities
of
new
england
his
appearance
at
the
cooper
institute
in
particular
was
a
critical
venture
and
he
knew
it
there
was
natural
curiosity
about
this
untutored
man
from
the
west
an
exaggerated
report
of
his
wit
prepared
the
way
for
probable
disappointment
the
surprise
which
awaited
his
hearers
was
of
a
different
kind
they
were
prepared
for
a
florid
western
eloquence
offensive
to
ears
which
were
used
to
a
less
spontaneous
turgidity
they
heard
instead
a
speech
with
no
ornament
at
all
whose
only
beauty
was
that
it
was
true
and
that
the
speaker
felt
it
the
single
flaw
in
the
cooper
institute
speech
has
already
been
cited
the
narrow
view
of
western
respectability
as
to
john
brown
for
the
rest
this
speech
dry
enough
in
a
sense
is
an
incomparably
masterly
statement
of
the
then
political
situation
reaching
from
its
far
back
origin
to
the
precise
and
definite
question
requiring
decision
at
that
moment
choate
who
as
a
young
man
was
present
set
down
of
late
years
his
vivid
recollection
of
that
evening
he
appeared
in
every
sense
of
the
word
like
one
of
the
plain
people
among
whom
he
loved
to
be
counted
at
first
sight
there
was
nothing
impressive
or
imposing
about
him
his
clothes
hung
awkwardly
on
his
giant
frame
his
face
was
of
a
dark
pallor
without
the
slightest
tinge
of
colour
his
seamed
and
rugged
features
bore
the
furrows
of
hardship
and
struggle
his
eyes
looked
sad
and
anxious
his
countenance
in
repose
gave
little
evidence
of
the
brilliant
power
which
raised
him
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
station
among
his
countrymen
as
he
talked
to
me
before
the
meeting
he
seemed
ill
at
ease
we
know
as
a
fact
that
among
his
causes
of
apprehension
he
was
for
the
first
time
painfully
conscious
of
those
clothes
when
he
spoke
proceeds
choate
he
was
transformed
his
eye
kindled
his
voice
rang
his
face
shone
and
seemed
to
light
up
the
whole
assembly
for
an
hour
and
a
half
he
held
his
audience
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
his
style
of
speech
and
manner
of
delivery
were
severely
simple
what
lowell
called
grand
simplicities
of
the
bible
with
which
he
was
so
familiar
were
reflected
in
his
discourse
it
was
marvellous
to
see
how
this
untutored
man
by
mere
and
the
chastening
of
his
own
spirit
had
outgrown
all
meretricious
arts
and
found
his
way
to
the
grandeur
and
strength
of
absolute
simplicity
the
newspapers
of
the
day
after
this
speech
confirm
these
reverent
reminiscences
on
this
his
first
introduction
to
the
cultivated
world
of
the
east
lincoln
audience
were
at
the
moment
and
for
the
moment
conscious
of
the
power
which
he
revealed
the
cooper
institute
speech
takes
the
plain
principle
that
slavery
is
wrong
and
draws
the
plain
inference
that
it
is
idle
to
seek
for
common
ground
with
men
who
say
it
is
right
strange
but
tragically
frequent
examples
show
how
rare
it
is
for
statesmen
in
times
of
crisis
to
grasp
the
essential
truth
so
simply
it
is
creditable
to
the
leading
men
of
new
york
that
they
recognised
a
speech
which
just
at
that
time
urged
this
plain
thing
in
sufficiently
plain
language
as
a
very
great
speech
and
had
an
inkling
of
great
and
simple
qualities
in
the
man
who
made
it
it
is
not
specially
discreditable
that
very
soon
and
for
a
long
while
part
of
them
or
of
those
who
were
influenced
by
their
report
reverted
to
their
former
prejudices
in
regard
to
lincoln
when
they
saw
him
thrust
by
election
managers
into
the
presidency
very
few
indeed
of
what
might
be
called
the
better
sort
believed
or
could
easily
learn
that
his
great
qualities
were
great
enough
to
compensate
easily
for
the
many
things
he
lacked
this
specially
grotesque
specimen
of
the
wild
west
was
soon
seen
not
to
be
of
the
charlatan
type
as
a
natural
alternative
he
was
assumed
to
be
something
of
a
simpleton
many
intelligent
men
retained
this
view
of
him
throughout
the
years
of
his
trial
and
only
when
his
triumph
and
tragic
death
set
going
a
sort
of
lincoln
myth
began
to
recollect
that
i
came
to
love
and
trust
him
even
before
i
knew
him
or
the
like
a
single
speech
like
this
at
the
cooper
institute
might
be
enough
to
show
a
later
time
that
lincoln
was
a
man
of
great
intellect
but
it
could
really
do
little
to
prepare
men
in
the
east
for
what
they
next
heard
of
him
already
a
movement
was
afoot
among
his
friends
in
illinois
to
secure
his
nomination
for
the
presidency
at
the
convention
of
the
republican
party
which
was
to
be
held
in
chicago
in
may
before
that
convention
could
assemble
it
had
become
fairly
certain
that
whoever
might
be
chosen
as
the
republican
candidate
would
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
signs
were
not
wanting
that
he
would
be
faced
with
grave
peril
to
the
union
for
the
democratic
party
which
had
met
in
convention
at
charleston
in
april
had
proceeded
to
split
into
two
sections
northern
and
southern
this
memorable
convention
was
a
dignified
assembly
gathered
in
a
serious
mood
in
a
city
of
some
antiquity
and
social
charm
from
the
first
however
a
latent
antipathy
between
the
northern
and
the
southern
delegates
made
itself
felt
the
northerners
predisposed
to
a
certain
deference
towards
the
south
and
prepared
to
appreciate
its
graceful
hospitality
experienced
an
uneasy
sense
that
they
were
regarded
as
social
inferiors
worse
trouble
than
this
appeared
when
the
convention
met
for
its
first
business
the
framing
of
the
party
platform
whether
the
position
which
lincoln
had
forced
douglas
to
take
up
had
precipitated
this
result
or
not
dissension
between
northern
and
southern
democrats
on
the
subject
of
slavery
had
already
manifested
itself
in
congress
and
in
the
party
convention
the
division
became
irreparable
douglas
it
will
be
remembered
had
started
with
the
principle
that
slavery
in
the
territories
formed
a
question
for
the
people
of
each
territory
to
decide
he
had
felt
bound
to
accept
the
doctrine
underlying
the
dred
scott
judgments
according
to
which
slavery
was
by
the
constitution
lawful
in
all
territories
pressed
by
lincoln
he
had
tried
to
reconcile
his
original
position
with
this
doctrine
by
maintaining
that
while
slavery
was
by
the
constitution
lawful
in
every
territory
it
was
nevertheless
lawful
for
a
territorial
legislature
to
make
practically
impossible
in
framing
a
declaration
of
the
party
principles
as
to
slavery
the
southern
delegates
in
the
democratic
convention
aimed
at
meeting
this
evasion
with
considerable
show
of
logic
they
asserted
in
the
party
platform
which
they
proposed
not
merely
the
abstract
rightfulness
and
lawfulness
of
slavery
but
the
duty
of
congress
itself
to
make
any
provision
that
might
be
necessary
to
protect
it
in
the
territories
to
this
the
northern
majority
of
the
delegates
could
not
consent
they
carried
an
amendment
declaring
merely
that
they
would
abide
by
any
decision
of
the
supreme
court
as
to
slavery
thereupon
the
delegates
not
indeed
of
the
whole
south
but
of
all
the
states
except
georgia
withdrew
from
the
convention
the
remaining
delegates
were
under
the
rules
of
the
convention
too
few
to
select
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
the
convention
adjourned
to
at
baltimore
in
june
eventually
after
attempts
at
reunion
and
further
dissensions
two
separate
democratic
conventions
at
baltimore
a
northern
and
a
southern
nominated
as
their
respective
candidates
stephen
douglas
the
obvious
choice
with
whom
if
the
southerners
had
cared
to
temporise
further
a
united
democratic
party
could
have
swept
the
polls
and
john
breckinridge
of
kentucky
a
gentleman
not
otherwise
known
than
as
the
standard
bearer
on
this
great
occasion
of
the
undisguised
and
unmitigated
claims
of
the
slave
owners
thus
it
was
that
the
american
democratic
party
forfeited
power
for
years
divided
between
the
consistent
maintenance
of
a
paradox
and
the
adroit
maintenance
of
inconsistency
another
party
in
this
election
demands
a
moment
notice
a
convention
of
delegates
claiming
to
represent
the
old
whigs
met
also
at
baltimore
and
declared
merely
that
it
stood
for
the
constitution
of
the
country
the
union
of
the
states
and
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
they
nominated
for
the
presidency
john
bell
of
tennessee
and
for
the
edward
everett
this
latter
gentleman
was
afterwards
chosen
as
the
orator
of
the
day
at
the
ceremony
on
the
battlefield
of
gettysburg
when
most
famous
speech
was
spoken
he
was
a
travelled
man
and
a
scholar
he
was
secretary
of
state
for
a
little
while
under
fillmore
and
dealt
honestly
and
firmly
with
the
then
troublous
question
of
cuba
his
orations
deserve
to
be
looked
at
for
they
are
favourable
examples
of
the
eloquence
which
american
taste
applauded
and
as
such
they
help
to
show
how
original
lincoln
was
in
the
simpler
beauty
of
his
own
simpler
diction
in
justice
to
the
whigs
let
it
be
noted
that
they
declared
for
the
maintenance
of
the
union
committing
themselves
with
decision
on
the
question
of
the
morrow
but
it
was
a
singular
platform
that
resolutely
and
totally
ignored
the
only
issue
of
the
day
few
politicians
can
really
afford
to
despise
either
this
conspicuously
foolish
attempt
to
overcome
a
difficulty
by
shutting
one
eyes
to
it
or
the
more
plausible
proposal
of
the
northern
democrats
to
continue
temporising
with
a
movement
for
slavery
in
which
they
were
neither
bold
enough
nor
corrupted
enough
to
join
the
consequences
now
known
to
us
of
a
determined
stand
against
the
advance
of
slavery
were
instinctively
foreseen
by
these
men
and
they
can
not
be
blamed
for
shrinking
from
them
yet
the
historian
now
knowing
that
those
consequences
exceeded
in
terror
all
that
could
have
been
foreseen
can
only
agree
with
the
judgment
expressed
by
lincoln
in
one
of
his
kansas
speeches
we
want
and
must
have
a
national
policy
as
to
slavery
which
deals
with
it
as
being
a
wrong
whoever
would
prevent
slavery
becoming
national
and
perpetual
yields
all
when
he
yields
to
a
policy
which
treats
it
either
as
being
right
or
as
being
a
matter
of
indifference
the
republican
party
had
been
founded
upon
just
this
opinion
electoral
victory
was
now
being
prepared
for
it
not
because
a
majority
was
likely
yet
to
take
so
resolute
a
view
but
because
its
effective
opponents
were
divided
between
those
who
had
gone
the
length
of
calling
slavery
right
and
those
who
strove
to
treat
it
as
indifferent
the
fate
of
america
may
be
said
to
have
depended
in
the
early
months
of
on
whether
the
nominee
of
the
republican
party
was
a
man
who
would
maintain
its
principles
with
irresolution
or
with
obstinacy
or
with
firm
moderation
when
it
had
first
been
suggested
to
lincoln
in
the
course
of
that
he
might
be
that
nominee
he
said
i
do
not
think
myself
fit
for
the
presidency
this
was
probably
his
sincere
opinion
at
the
moment
though
perhaps
the
moment
was
one
of
dejection
in
any
case
his
opinion
soon
changed
and
though
it
is
not
clear
whether
he
encouraged
his
friends
to
bring
his
name
forward
we
know
in
a
general
way
that
when
they
decided
to
do
so
he
used
every
effort
of
his
own
to
help
them
we
must
accept
without
reserve
herndon
reiterated
assertion
that
lincoln
was
intensely
ambitious
and
if
ambition
means
the
eager
desire
for
great
opportunities
the
depreciation
of
it
which
has
long
been
a
commonplace
of
literature
and
which
may
be
traced
back
to
the
epicureans
is
a
piece
of
cant
which
ought
to
be
withdrawn
from
currency
and
ambition
commensurate
with
the
powers
which
each
man
can
discover
in
himself
should
be
frankly
recognised
as
a
part
of
christian
duty
in
judging
him
to
be
the
best
man
for
the
presidency
lincoln
illinois
friends
and
he
himself
formed
a
very
sensible
judgment
but
they
did
so
in
flagrant
contradiction
to
many
superficial
appearances
this
candidate
for
the
chief
magistracy
at
a
critical
time
of
one
of
the
great
nations
of
the
world
had
never
administered
any
concern
much
larger
than
that
post
office
that
he
once
carried
around
in
his
hat
of
the
several
other
gentlemen
whose
names
were
before
the
party
there
was
none
who
might
not
seem
greatly
to
surpass
him
in
experience
of
affairs
to
one
of
them
seward
the
nomination
seemed
to
belong
almost
of
right
chase
and
seward
both
were
known
and
dignified
figures
in
that
great
assembly
the
senate
chase
was
of
proved
rectitude
and
courage
seward
of
proved
and
very
considerable
ability
chase
had
been
governor
of
ohio
seward
of
new
york
state
and
the
position
of
governor
in
a
state
a
state
it
must
be
remembered
is
independent
in
almost
the
whole
of
what
we
call
domestic
politics
is
strictly
analogous
to
the
position
of
president
in
the
union
and
especially
in
a
great
state
is
the
best
training
ground
for
the
presidency
but
beyond
this
seward
between
whom
and
lincoln
the
real
contest
lay
had
for
some
time
filled
a
recognised
though
unofficial
position
as
the
leader
of
his
party
he
had
failed
as
has
been
seen
in
his
dealings
with
douglas
in
stern
insistence
upon
principle
but
the
failure
was
due
rather
to
his
sanguine
and
hopeful
temper
than
to
lack
of
courage
on
the
whole
from
the
time
when
he
first
stood
up
against
webster
in
the
discussions
of
when
lincoln
was
both
silent
and
obscure
he
had
earned
his
position
well
hereafter
as
lincoln
subordinate
he
was
to
do
his
country
service
and
to
earn
a
pure
fame
as
the
most
generously
loyal
subordinate
to
a
chief
whom
he
had
thought
himself
fit
to
command
we
happen
to
have
ample
means
of
estimating
now
all
republican
competitors
we
know
that
none
of
the
rest
were
equal
to
seward
and
we
know
that
seward
himself
if
he
had
had
his
way
would
have
brought
the
common
cause
to
ruin
looking
back
now
at
the
comparison
which
lincoln
when
he
entered
into
the
contest
must
have
drawn
between
himself
and
seward
for
of
the
rest
we
need
not
take
account
we
can
see
that
to
himself
at
least
and
some
few
in
illinois
he
had
now
proved
his
capacities
and
that
in
seward
public
record
more
especially
in
his
attitude
towards
douglas
he
had
the
means
of
measuring
seward
in
spite
of
the
far
greater
experience
of
the
latter
he
may
have
thought
himself
to
be
his
superior
in
that
indefinable
thing
the
sheer
strength
of
a
man
not
only
may
he
have
thought
this
he
must
have
known
it
he
had
shown
his
grasp
of
the
essential
facts
when
he
forced
the
republican
party
to
do
battle
with
douglas
and
the
party
of
indifference
he
showed
the
same
now
when
after
long
years
of
patience
and
he
pushed
himself
into
seward
place
as
the
republican
leader
all
the
same
what
little
we
know
of
the
methods
by
which
he
now
helped
his
own
promotion
suggests
that
the
people
who
then
and
long
after
set
him
down
as
a
person
may
have
had
a
good
deal
to
go
upon
a
kind
friend
has
produced
a
letter
which
he
wrote
in
march
to
a
kansas
gentleman
who
desired
to
be
a
delegate
to
the
republican
convention
and
who
offered
upon
condition
to
persuade
his
fellow
delegates
from
kansas
to
support
lincoln
here
is
the
letter
as
to
your
kind
wishes
for
myself
allow
me
to
say
i
can
not
enter
the
ring
on
the
money
basis
first
because
in
the
main
it
is
wrong
and
secondly
i
have
not
and
can
not
get
the
money
i
say
in
the
main
the
use
of
money
is
wrong
but
for
certain
objects
in
a
political
contest
the
use
of
some
is
both
right
and
indispensable
with
me
as
with
yourself
this
long
struggle
has
been
one
of
great
pecuniary
loss
i
now
distinctly
say
this
if
you
shall
be
appointed
a
delegate
to
chicago
i
will
furnish
one
hundred
dollars
to
bear
the
expenses
of
the
trip
the
kansas
gentleman
failed
to
obtain
the
support
of
the
kansas
delegates
as
a
body
for
lincoln
lincoln
none
the
less
held
to
his
promise
of
a
hundred
dollars
if
the
man
came
to
chicago
and
having
we
are
assured
much
confidence
in
him
took
the
earliest
opportunity
of
appointing
him
to
a
lucrative
office
besides
consulting
him
as
to
other
appointments
in
kansas
this
is
all
that
we
know
of
the
affair
but
our
informant
presents
it
as
one
of
a
number
of
instances
in
which
lincoln
trusted
a
man
too
soon
and
obstinately
clung
to
his
mistake
as
to
the
appointment
the
man
had
evidently
begun
by
soliciting
money
in
a
way
which
would
have
marked
him
to
most
of
us
as
a
somewhat
unsuitable
candidate
for
any
important
post
and
the
payment
of
the
hundred
dollars
plainly
transgresses
a
code
both
of
honour
and
of
prudence
which
most
politicians
will
recognise
and
which
should
not
need
definition
to
say
as
lincoln
probably
said
to
himself
that
there
is
nothing
intrinsically
wrong
in
a
moderate
payment
for
expenses
to
a
fellow
worker
in
a
public
cause
whom
you
believe
to
have
sacrificed
much
is
to
ignore
the
point
indeed
several
points
lincoln
hungry
now
for
some
success
in
his
own
unrewarded
career
was
tempted
to
a
small
manoeuvre
by
which
he
might
pick
up
a
little
support
he
was
at
the
same
time
tempted
no
less
to
act
generously
according
to
his
means
towards
a
man
who
he
readily
believed
had
made
sacrifices
like
his
own
he
was
not
the
man
to
stand
against
this
double
temptation
petty
lapses
of
this
order
especially
when
the
delinquent
may
be
seen
to
hesitate
and
excuse
himself
are
more
irritating
than
many
larger
and
more
brazen
offences
for
they
give
us
the
sense
of
not
knowing
where
we
are
when
they
are
committed
by
a
man
of
seemingly
strong
and
high
character
it
is
well
to
ask
just
what
they
signify
some
of
the
shrewdest
observers
of
lincoln
friendly
and
unfriendly
concur
in
their
description
of
the
weaknesses
of
which
this
incident
may
serve
as
the
example
weaknesses
partly
belonging
to
his
temperament
but
partly
such
as
a
man
risen
from
poverty
with
little
variety
of
experience
and
with
no
background
of
home
training
stands
small
chance
of
escaping
for
one
thing
his
judgment
of
men
and
how
to
treat
them
was
as
bad
in
some
ways
as
it
was
good
in
others
his
own
sure
grasp
of
the
largest
and
commonest
things
in
life
and
his
sober
and
measured
trust
in
human
nature
as
a
whole
gave
him
a
rare
knowledge
of
the
mind
of
the
people
in
the
mass
so
too
when
he
had
known
a
man
long
or
been
with
him
or
against
him
in
important
transactions
he
sometimes
developed
great
insight
and
sureness
of
touch
and
when
the
man
was
at
bottom
trustworthy
his
robust
confidence
in
him
was
sometimes
of
great
public
service
but
he
had
no
gift
of
rapid
perception
and
no
instinctive
tact
or
prudence
in
regard
to
the
very
numerous
and
very
various
men
with
whom
he
had
slight
dealings
on
which
he
could
bestow
no
thought
this
is
common
with
men
who
have
risen
from
poverty
if
they
have
not
become
hard
and
suspicious
they
are
generally
obtuse
to
the
minor
indications
by
which
shrewd
men
of
education
know
the
impostor
and
they
are
perversely
indulgent
to
little
meannesses
in
their
fellows
which
they
are
incapable
of
committing
themselves
in
lincoln
this
was
aggravated
by
an
immense
as
he
confessed
he
could
hardly
say
no
it
was
an
obstinate
which
found
a
naughty
pleasure
in
refusing
to
be
corrected
and
if
it
should
happen
that
the
object
of
his
weak
benevolence
had
given
him
personal
cause
of
offence
the
became
more
incorrigible
than
ever
moreover
lincoln
strength
was
a
slow
strength
shown
most
in
matters
in
which
elementary
principles
of
right
or
the
concentration
of
intense
thought
guided
him
where
minor
and
more
subtle
principles
of
conduct
should
have
come
in
on
questions
which
had
not
come
within
the
range
of
his
reflection
so
far
and
to
which
amidst
his
heavy
duties
he
could
not
spare
much
cogitation
he
would
not
always
show
acute
perception
and
which
is
far
worse
he
would
often
show
weakness
of
will
the
present
instance
may
be
ever
so
trifling
yet
it
does
relate
to
the
indistinct
and
dangerous
borderland
of
political
corruption
it
need
arouse
no
very
serious
suspicions
herndon
whose
pertinacious
researches
unearthed
that
kansas
gentleman
correspondence
and
who
is
keenly
censorious
of
lincoln
fault
in
the
upshot
trusts
and
reveres
lincoln
and
the
massive
testimony
of
his
keenest
critics
to
his
honesty
quite
decides
the
matter
but
lincoln
had
lived
in
a
simple
western
town
not
in
one
of
the
already
polluted
great
cities
he
was
a
poor
man
himself
and
took
the
fact
that
wealth
was
used
against
him
as
a
part
of
the
inevitable
drawbacks
of
his
lot
and
it
is
certain
that
he
did
not
clearly
take
account
of
the
whole
business
of
corruption
and
jobbery
as
a
hideous
and
growing
peril
to
america
it
is
certain
too
that
he
lacked
the
delicate
perception
of
propriety
in
such
matters
or
the
strict
resolution
in
adhering
to
it
on
small
occasions
which
might
have
been
possessed
by
a
far
less
honest
man
the
severest
criticisms
which
lincoln
afterwards
incurred
were
directed
to
the
appointments
which
he
made
we
shall
see
hereafter
that
he
had
very
solid
reasons
for
his
general
conduct
in
such
matters
but
it
can
not
be
said
with
conviction
that
he
had
that
horror
of
appointment
on
other
grounds
than
merit
which
enlightens
though
it
does
not
always
govern
more
educated
statesmen
his
administration
would
have
been
more
successful
and
the
legacy
he
left
to
american
public
life
more
bountiful
if
his
traditions
or
the
length
of
his
day
work
had
allowed
him
to
be
more
careful
in
these
things
as
it
is
he
was
not
commended
to
the
people
of
america
and
must
not
be
commended
to
us
by
the
absence
of
defects
as
a
ruler
or
as
a
man
but
by
the
qualities
to
which
his
defects
belonged
an
acute
literary
man
wrote
of
lincoln
when
he
had
been
three
years
in
office
these
remarkable
words
you
ca
help
feeling
an
interest
in
him
a
sympathy
and
a
kind
of
pity
feeling
too
that
he
has
some
qualities
of
great
value
yet
fearing
that
his
weak
points
may
wreck
him
or
may
wreck
something
his
life
seems
a
series
of
wise
sound
conclusions
slowly
reached
oddly
worked
out
on
great
questions
with
constant
failures
in
administration
of
detail
and
dealings
with
individuals
it
was
evidently
a
clever
man
who
wrote
this
he
would
have
been
a
wise
man
if
he
had
known
that
the
praise
he
was
bestowing
on
lincoln
was
immeasurably
greater
than
the
blame
so
the
natural
prejudice
of
those
who
welcomed
lincoln
as
a
prophet
in
the
cooper
institute
but
found
his
candidature
for
the
presidency
ridiculous
was
not
wholly
without
justification
his
partisans
however
also
not
unjustly
used
his
humble
origin
for
all
it
was
worth
the
republicans
of
illinois
were
assembled
at
decatur
in
preparation
for
the
chicago
convention
when
amid
tumultuous
cheers
there
marched
in
old
john
hanks
and
another
pioneer
bearing
on
their
shoulders
two
long
fence
rails
labelled
two
rails
from
a
lot
made
by
abraham
lincoln
and
john
hanks
in
the
sangamon
bottom
in
the
year
gentlemen
said
lincoln
in
response
to
loud
calls
i
suppose
you
want
to
know
something
about
those
things
well
the
truth
is
john
hanks
and
i
did
make
rails
in
the
sangamon
bottom
i
know
whether
we
made
those
rails
or
not
fact
is
i
do
think
they
are
a
credit
to
the
makers
but
i
do
know
this
i
made
rails
then
and
i
think
i
could
make
better
ones
than
these
now
it
is
unnecessary
to
tell
of
the
part
those
rails
were
to
play
in
the
coming
campaign
it
is
a
contemptible
trait
in
books
like
that
able
novel
democracy
that
they
treat
the
sentiment
which
attached
to
the
as
anything
but
honourable
the
republican
convention
met
at
chicago
in
circumstances
of
far
less
dignity
than
the
democratic
convention
at
charleston
processions
and
brass
bands
rough
fellows
collected
by
lincoln
managers
rowdies
imported
from
new
york
by
seward
filled
the
streets
with
noise
and
the
saloon
keepers
did
good
business
yet
the
actual
convention
consisted
of
grave
men
in
an
earnest
mood
besides
seward
and
chase
and
lincoln
cameron
of
pennsylvania
and
bates
of
missouri
of
whom
we
shall
hear
later
were
proposed
for
the
presidency
so
also
were
dayton
and
collamer
politicians
of
some
repute
and
mclean
of
the
supreme
court
had
some
supporters
the
prevalent
expectation
in
the
states
was
that
seward
would
easily
secure
the
nomination
but
it
very
soon
appeared
in
the
convention
that
his
opponents
were
too
strong
for
that
several
ballots
took
place
there
were
the
usual
conferences
and
bargainings
which
probably
affected
the
result
but
little
lincoln
managers
especially
judge
david
davis
afterwards
of
the
supreme
court
were
shrewd
people
lincoln
had
written
to
them
expressly
that
they
could
make
no
bargain
binding
on
him
but
when
cameron
was
clearly
out
of
the
running
they
did
promise
cameron
supporters
a
place
in
lincoln
cabinet
and
a
similar
promise
was
made
for
one
caleb
smith
the
delegates
from
pennsylvania
went
on
to
lincoln
then
those
of
ohio
and
before
long
his
victory
was
assured
a
committee
of
the
convention
some
of
them
sick
at
heart
was
sent
to
bear
the
invitation
to
lincoln
he
received
them
in
his
little
house
with
a
simple
dignity
which
one
of
them
has
recorded
and
as
they
came
away
one
said
well
we
might
have
chosen
a
handsomer
article
but
i
doubt
whether
a
better
on
the
whole
if
we
can
put
aside
the
illusion
which
besets
us
who
read
the
preceding
history
if
at
all
in
the
light
of
speeches
and
to
whom
his
competitors
are
mere
names
this
was
the
most
surprising
nomination
ever
made
in
america
other
presidential
candidates
have
been
born
in
poverty
but
none
ever
wore
the
scars
of
poverty
so
plainly
others
have
been
intrinsically
more
obscure
but
these
have
usually
been
chosen
as
bearing
the
of
eminent
prosperity
or
gentility
lincoln
had
indeed
at
this
time
displayed
brilliant
ability
in
the
debates
with
douglas
and
he
had
really
shown
a
statesman
grasp
of
the
situation
more
than
any
other
republican
leader
the
friends
in
illinois
who
put
him
forward
men
like
david
davis
who
was
a
man
of
distinction
himself
did
so
from
a
true
appreciation
of
his
powers
but
this
does
not
seem
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
bulk
of
the
delegates
from
other
states
the
explanation
given
us
of
their
action
is
curious
the
choice
was
not
the
result
of
merit
on
the
other
hand
it
was
not
the
work
of
the
ordinary
wicked
for
what
may
be
called
the
machine
was
working
for
seward
the
choice
was
made
by
plain
representative
americans
who
set
to
themselves
this
question
with
what
candidate
can
we
beat
douglas
and
who
found
the
answer
in
the
prevalence
of
a
popular
impression
concerning
lincoln
and
seward
which
was
in
fact
wholly
mistaken
there
was
it
happens
earnest
opposition
to
seward
among
some
eastern
republicans
on
the
good
ground
that
he
was
a
clean
man
but
with
doubtful
associates
this
opposition
could
not
by
itself
have
defeated
him
what
did
defeat
him
was
his
reputation
at
the
moment
as
a
very
advanced
republican
who
would
scare
away
the
support
of
the
weaker
brethren
he
was
for
instance
the
author
of
the
alarming
phrase
about
irrepressible
conflict
and
he
had
spoken
once
in
a
phrase
that
was
misinterpreted
about
a
higher
law
than
the
constitution
lincoln
had
in
action
taken
a
far
stronger
line
than
seward
he
was
also
the
author
of
the
phrase
about
the
house
divided
against
itself
but
then
besides
the
fact
that
lincoln
was
well
regarded
just
where
douglas
was
most
popular
lincoln
was
a
less
noted
man
than
seward
and
his
stronger
words
occasioned
less
wide
alarm
so
to
please
those
who
liked
compromise
the
convention
rejected
a
man
who
would
certainly
have
compromised
and
chose
one
who
would
give
all
that
moderation
demanded
and
die
before
he
yielded
one
further
inch
many
americans
have
been
disposed
to
trace
in
the
raising
up
of
lincoln
the
hand
of
a
providence
protecting
their
country
in
its
worst
need
it
would
be
affectation
to
set
their
idea
altogether
aside
it
is
at
any
rate
a
memorable
incident
in
the
history
of
a
democracy
permeated
with
excellent
intentions
but
often
hopelessly
subject
to
inferior
influences
that
at
this
critical
moment
the
fit
man
was
chosen
on
the
very
ground
of
his
supposed
unfitness
the
result
of
the
contest
between
the
four
presidential
candidates
was
rendered
almost
a
foregone
conclusion
by
the
decision
of
the
democrats
lincoln
in
deference
to
the
usual
and
seemly
procedure
took
no
part
in
the
campaign
nor
do
his
doings
in
the
next
months
concern
us
seward
to
his
great
honour
after
privately
expressing
his
bitter
chagrin
at
the
bestowal
of
what
was
his
due
upon
a
little
illinois
attorney
threw
himself
into
the
contest
and
went
about
making
admirable
speeches
on
the
night
of
november
lincoln
sat
alone
with
the
operator
in
the
telegraph
box
at
springfield
receiving
as
they
came
in
the
results
of
the
elections
of
presidential
electors
in
the
various
states
long
before
the
returns
were
complete
his
knowledge
of
such
matters
made
him
sure
of
his
return
and
before
he
left
that
box
he
had
solved
in
principle
as
he
afterwards
declared
the
first
and
by
no
means
least
important
problem
of
his
presidency
the
choice
of
a
cabinet
the
victory
was
in
one
aspect
far
from
complete
if
we
look
not
at
the
votes
in
the
electoral
college
with
which
the
formal
choice
of
president
lay
but
at
the
popular
votes
by
which
the
electors
were
returned
we
shall
see
that
the
new
president
was
elected
by
a
minority
of
the
american
people
he
had
a
large
majority
over
douglas
but
if
douglas
had
received
the
votes
which
were
given
for
the
southern
democrat
breckinridge
he
would
have
had
a
considerable
majority
over
lincoln
though
the
odd
machinery
of
the
electoral
college
would
still
have
kept
him
out
of
the
presidency
in
another
aspect
it
was
a
fatally
significant
victory
lincoln
votes
were
drawn
only
from
the
northern
states
he
carried
almost
all
the
free
states
and
he
carried
no
others
for
the
first
time
in
american
history
the
united
north
had
used
its
superior
numbers
to
outvote
the
south
this
would
in
any
case
have
caused
great
vexation
and
the
personality
of
the
man
chosen
by
the
north
aggravated
it
the
election
of
lincoln
was
greeted
throughout
the
south
with
a
howl
of
derision
chapter
vi
secession
case
of
the
south
against
the
the
republicans
of
the
north
had
given
their
votes
upon
a
very
clear
issue
but
probably
few
of
them
had
fully
realised
how
grave
a
result
would
follow
within
a
few
days
of
the
election
of
lincoln
the
first
step
in
the
movement
of
secession
had
been
taken
and
before
the
new
president
entered
upon
his
duties
it
was
plain
that
either
the
dissatisfied
states
must
be
allowed
to
leave
the
union
or
the
union
must
be
maintained
by
war
englishmen
at
that
time
and
since
have
found
a
difficulty
in
grasping
the
precise
cause
of
the
war
that
followed
of
those
who
were
inclined
to
sympathise
with
the
north
some
regarded
the
war
as
being
simply
about
slavery
and
while
unhesitatingly
opposed
to
slavery
wondered
whether
it
was
right
to
make
war
upon
it
others
regarding
it
as
a
war
for
the
union
and
not
against
slavery
at
all
wondered
whether
it
was
right
to
make
war
for
a
union
that
could
not
be
peaceably
maintained
now
it
is
seldom
possible
to
state
the
cause
of
a
war
quite
candidly
in
a
single
sentence
because
as
a
rule
there
are
on
each
side
people
who
concur
in
the
final
rupture
for
somewhat
different
reasons
but
in
this
case
forecasting
a
conclusion
which
must
be
examined
in
some
detail
we
can
state
the
cause
of
war
in
a
very
few
sentences
if
we
ask
first
what
the
south
fought
for
the
answer
is
the
leaders
of
the
south
and
the
great
mass
of
the
southern
people
had
a
single
supreme
and
object
in
view
namely
to
ensure
the
permanence
and
if
need
be
the
extension
of
the
slave
system
they
carried
with
them
however
a
certain
number
of
southerners
who
were
opposed
or
at
least
averse
to
slavery
but
who
thought
that
the
right
of
their
states
to
leave
the
union
or
remain
in
it
as
they
chose
must
be
maintained
if
we
ask
what
the
north
fought
for
the
answer
is
a
majority
by
no
means
overwhelming
of
the
northern
people
refused
to
purchase
the
adhesion
of
the
south
by
conniving
at
any
further
extension
of
slavery
and
an
overwhelming
majority
refused
to
let
the
south
dissolve
the
union
for
slavery
or
for
any
other
cause
the
issue
about
slavery
then
became
merged
in
another
issue
concerning
the
union
which
had
so
far
remained
in
the
background
the
first
thing
that
must
be
grasped
about
it
is
the
total
difference
of
view
which
now
existed
between
north
and
south
in
regard
to
the
very
nature
of
their
connection
the
divergence
had
taken
place
so
completely
and
in
the
main
so
quietly
that
each
side
now
realised
with
surprise
and
indignation
that
the
other
held
an
opposite
opinion
in
the
north
the
union
was
regarded
as
constituting
a
permanent
and
unquestionable
national
unity
from
which
it
was
flat
rebellion
for
a
state
or
any
other
combination
of
persons
to
secede
in
the
south
the
union
appeared
merely
as
a
peculiarly
venerable
treaty
of
alliance
of
which
the
dissolution
would
be
very
painful
but
which
left
each
state
a
sovereign
body
with
an
indefeasible
right
to
secede
if
in
the
last
resort
it
judged
that
the
painful
necessity
had
come
in
a
few
border
states
there
was
division
and
doubt
on
this
subject
a
fact
which
must
have
helped
to
hide
from
each
side
the
true
strength
of
opinion
on
the
other
but
setting
aside
these
border
states
there
were
in
the
north
some
who
doubted
whether
it
was
expedient
to
fight
for
the
union
but
none
of
any
consequence
who
doubted
that
it
was
constitutionally
correct
and
there
were
in
the
south
men
who
insisted
that
no
occasion
to
secede
had
arisen
but
these
very
men
when
outvoted
in
their
states
maintained
most
passionately
the
absolute
right
of
secession
the
two
sides
contended
for
two
contrary
doctrines
of
constitutional
law
it
is
natural
when
parties
are
disputing
over
a
question
of
political
wisdom
and
of
moral
right
that
each
should
claim
for
its
contention
if
possible
the
sanction
of
acknowledged
legal
principle
so
it
was
with
the
parties
to
the
english
civil
war
and
the
tendency
to
regard
matters
from
a
legal
point
of
view
is
to
this
day
deeply
engrained
in
the
mental
habits
of
america
but
north
and
south
were
really
divided
by
something
other
than
legal
opinion
a
difference
in
the
objects
to
which
their
feelings
of
loyalty
and
patriotism
were
directed
this
difference
found
apt
expression
in
the
cabinet
of
president
buchanan
who
of
course
remained
in
office
between
the
election
of
lincoln
in
november
and
his
inauguration
in
march
general
cass
of
michigan
had
formerly
stood
for
the
presidency
with
the
support
of
the
south
and
he
held
cabinet
office
now
as
a
sympathiser
with
the
south
upon
slavery
but
he
was
a
northerner
i
see
how
it
is
he
said
to
two
of
his
colleagues
you
are
a
virginian
and
you
are
a
south
carolinian
i
am
not
a
michigander
i
am
an
american
in
a
former
chapter
the
creation
of
the
union
and
the
beginnings
of
a
common
national
life
have
been
traced
in
outline
obstacles
to
the
union
had
existed
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
and
after
it
had
been
carried
the
tendency
to
threaten
disruption
upon
some
slight
conflict
of
interest
had
shown
itself
in
each
but
a
proud
sense
of
single
nationality
had
soon
become
prevalent
in
both
and
in
the
north
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
set
back
this
growth
for
the
idea
which
lowell
had
once
attributed
to
his
hosea
biglow
of
abjuring
union
with
slave
owners
was
a
negligible
force
undivided
allegiance
to
the
union
was
the
natural
sentiment
of
citizens
of
ohio
or
wisconsin
states
created
by
the
authority
of
the
union
out
of
the
common
dominion
of
the
union
it
had
become
if
anything
more
deeply
engrained
in
the
original
states
of
the
north
for
their
predominant
occupation
in
commerce
would
tend
in
this
particular
to
give
them
larger
views
the
pride
of
a
boston
man
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
was
of
the
same
order
as
his
pride
in
the
city
of
boston
both
were
largely
pride
in
the
part
which
boston
and
massachusetts
had
taken
in
making
the
united
states
of
america
such
a
man
knew
well
that
south
carolina
had
once
threatened
secession
but
for
that
matter
the
federalists
of
new
england
had
once
threatened
it
the
argument
of
webster
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
was
a
classic
and
was
taken
as
conclusive
on
the
question
of
legal
right
the
terser
and
more
resonant
declaration
of
president
jackson
a
southerner
and
the
response
to
it
which
thrilled
all
states
south
or
north
outside
south
carolina
had
set
the
seal
to
webster
doctrines
there
had
been
loud
and
ominous
talk
of
secession
lately
it
was
certainly
not
mere
bluster
northerners
in
the
main
were
cautious
politicians
and
had
been
tempted
to
go
far
to
conciliate
it
but
if
the
claim
of
southern
states
were
put
in
practice
the
whole
north
would
now
regard
it
not
as
a
respectable
claim
but
as
an
outrage
it
is
important
to
notice
that
the
disposition
to
take
this
view
did
not
depend
upon
advanced
opinions
against
slavery
some
of
the
most
violent
opponents
of
slavery
would
care
relatively
little
about
the
constitution
or
the
union
they
would
at
first
hesitate
as
to
whether
a
peaceful
separation
between
states
which
felt
so
differently
on
a
moral
question
like
slavery
was
not
a
more
christian
solution
of
their
difference
than
a
fratricidal
war
on
the
other
hand
men
who
cared
little
about
slavery
and
would
gladly
have
sacrificed
any
convictions
they
had
upon
that
matter
for
the
sake
of
the
union
were
at
first
none
the
less
vehement
in
their
anger
at
an
attack
upon
the
union
there
is
moreover
a
more
subtle
but
still
important
point
to
be
observed
in
this
connection
democrats
in
the
north
inclined
as
a
party
to
stringent
and
perhaps
pedantically
legal
views
of
state
rights
as
against
the
rights
of
the
union
but
this
by
no
means
necessarily
meant
that
they
sympathised
more
than
republicans
with
the
claim
to
dissolve
the
union
they
laid
emphasis
on
state
rights
merely
because
they
believed
that
these
would
be
a
bulwark
against
any
sort
of
government
tyranny
and
that
the
large
power
which
was
reserved
to
the
local
or
provincial
authorities
of
the
states
made
the
government
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
more
truly
expressive
of
the
will
of
the
whole
people
they
now
found
themselves
entangled
as
we
shall
see
in
curious
doubts
as
to
what
the
federal
government
might
do
to
maintain
the
union
but
they
had
not
the
faintest
doubt
that
the
union
was
meant
to
be
maintained
the
point
which
is
now
being
emphasised
must
not
be
misapprehended
differences
of
sentiment
in
regard
to
slavery
in
regard
to
state
rights
in
regard
to
the
authority
of
government
did
as
the
war
went
on
and
the
price
was
paid
gravely
embarrass
the
north
but
it
was
a
solid
and
unhesitating
north
which
said
that
the
south
had
no
right
to
secede
up
to
a
certain
point
the
sense
of
patriotic
pride
in
the
union
had
grown
also
in
the
south
it
was
fostered
at
first
by
the
predominant
part
which
the
south
played
in
the
political
life
of
the
country
but
for
a
generation
past
the
sense
of
a
separate
interest
of
the
south
had
been
growing
still
more
vigorously
the
political
predominance
of
the
south
had
continued
but
under
a
standing
menace
of
downfall
as
the
north
grew
more
populous
and
the
patriotism
which
it
at
first
encouraged
had
become
perverted
into
an
arrogantly
unconscious
feeling
that
the
union
was
an
excellent
thing
on
condition
that
it
was
subservient
to
the
south
the
common
interest
of
the
southern
states
was
slavery
and
when
the
northerners
had
become
a
majority
which
might
one
day
dominate
the
federal
government
this
common
interest
of
the
slave
states
found
a
weapon
at
hand
in
the
doctrine
of
the
inherent
sovereignty
of
each
individual
state
this
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
had
come
to
be
held
as
universally
in
the
south
as
the
strict
unionist
doctrine
in
the
north
and
held
with
as
quiet
and
unshakable
a
confidence
that
it
could
not
be
questioned
it
does
not
seem
at
all
strange
that
the
state
as
against
the
union
should
have
remained
the
supreme
object
of
loyalty
in
old
communities
like
those
of
south
carolina
and
virginia
abounding
as
they
did
in
conservative
influences
which
were
lacking
in
the
north
but
this
provincial
loyalty
was
not
in
the
same
sense
a
natural
growth
in
states
like
alabama
or
mississippi
these
no
less
than
indiana
and
illinois
were
the
creatures
of
the
federal
congress
set
up
within
the
memory
of
living
men
with
arbitrary
boundaries
that
cut
across
any
old
lines
of
division
there
was
in
fact
no
spontaneous
feeling
of
allegiance
attaching
to
these
political
units
and
the
doctrine
of
their
sovereignty
had
no
use
except
as
a
screen
for
the
interest
in
slavery
which
the
southern
states
had
in
common
but
calhoun
in
a
manner
characteristic
of
his
peculiar
and
dangerous
type
of
intellect
had
early
seen
in
a
view
of
state
sovereignty
which
would
otherwise
have
been
obsolete
the
most
serviceable
weapon
for
the
joint
interests
of
the
southern
states
in
a
society
where
intellectual
life
was
restricted
his
ascendency
had
been
great
though
his
disciples
had
reasonably
enough
thrown
aside
the
qualifications
which
his
subtle
mind
had
attached
to
the
right
of
secession
thus
in
the
southern
states
generally
even
among
men
most
strongly
opposed
to
the
actual
proposal
to
secede
the
real
or
alleged
constitutional
right
of
a
state
to
secede
if
it
chose
now
passed
unquestioned
and
was
even
regarded
as
a
precious
liberty
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
asking
whether
on
this
question
of
constitutional
law
the
northern
opinion
or
the
southern
opinion
was
correct
the
question
was
indeed
an
important
question
in
determining
the
proper
course
of
procedure
for
a
president
when
confronted
with
secession
but
it
must
be
protested
that
the
moral
right
and
political
wisdom
of
neither
party
in
the
war
depended
mainly
if
at
all
upon
this
legal
point
it
was
a
question
of
the
construction
which
a
court
of
law
should
put
upon
a
document
which
was
not
drawn
up
with
any
view
to
determining
this
point
if
we
go
behind
the
constitution
which
was
then
and
is
now
in
force
to
the
original
document
of
which
it
took
the
place
we
shall
find
it
entitled
articles
of
confederation
and
perpetual
union
but
we
shall
not
find
any
such
provisions
as
men
desirous
of
creating
a
stable
and
permanent
federal
government
might
have
been
expected
to
frame
if
we
read
the
actual
constitution
we
shall
find
no
word
distinctly
implying
that
a
state
could
or
could
not
secede
as
to
the
real
intention
of
its
chief
authors
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
hoped
and
trusted
the
union
would
prove
indissoluble
and
equally
little
doubt
that
they
did
not
wish
to
obtrude
upon
those
whom
they
asked
to
enter
into
it
the
thought
that
this
step
would
be
irrevocable
for
the
view
taken
in
the
south
there
is
one
really
powerful
argument
on
which
jefferson
davis
insisted
passionately
in
the
argumentative
memoirs
with
which
he
solaced
himself
in
old
age
it
is
that
in
several
of
the
states
when
the
constitution
was
accepted
public
declarations
were
made
to
the
citizens
of
those
states
by
their
own
representatives
that
a
state
might
withdraw
from
the
union
but
this
is
far
from
conclusive
no
man
gets
rid
of
the
obligation
of
a
bond
by
telling
a
witness
that
he
does
not
mean
to
be
bound
the
question
is
not
what
he
means
but
what
the
party
with
whom
he
deals
must
naturally
take
him
to
mean
now
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
upon
the
face
of
it
purports
to
create
a
government
able
to
take
its
place
among
the
other
governments
of
the
world
able
if
it
declares
war
to
wield
the
whole
force
of
its
country
in
that
war
and
able
if
it
makes
peace
to
impose
that
peace
upon
all
its
subjects
this
seems
to
imply
that
the
authority
of
that
government
over
part
of
the
country
should
be
legally
indefeasible
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
if
during
a
war
with
great
britain
states
on
the
canadian
border
should
have
had
the
legal
right
to
secede
and
set
up
a
neutral
government
with
a
view
to
subsequent
reunion
with
great
britain
the
sound
legal
view
of
this
matter
would
seem
to
be
that
the
doctrine
of
secession
is
so
repugnant
to
the
primary
intention
with
which
the
national
instrument
of
government
was
framed
that
it
could
only
have
been
supported
by
an
express
reservation
of
the
right
to
secede
in
the
constitution
itself
the
duke
of
argyll
one
of
the
few
british
statesmen
of
the
time
who
followed
this
struggle
with
intelligent
interest
briefly
summed
up
the
question
thus
i
know
of
no
government
in
the
world
that
could
possibly
have
admitted
the
right
of
secession
from
its
own
allegiance
oddly
enough
president
buchanan
in
his
message
to
congress
on
december
put
the
same
point
not
less
forcibly
but
to
say
as
in
a
legal
sense
we
may
that
the
southern
states
rebelled
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
they
were
wrong
the
deliberate
endeavour
of
a
people
to
separate
themselves
from
the
political
sovereignty
under
which
they
live
and
set
up
a
new
political
community
in
which
their
national
life
shall
develop
itself
more
fully
or
more
securely
must
always
command
a
certain
respect
whether
it
is
entitled
further
to
the
full
sympathy
and
to
the
support
or
at
least
acquiescence
of
others
is
a
question
which
in
particular
cases
involves
considerations
such
as
can
not
be
foreseen
in
any
abstract
discussion
of
political
theory
but
speaking
very
generally
it
is
a
question
in
the
main
of
the
worth
which
we
attribute
on
the
one
hand
to
the
common
life
to
which
it
is
sought
to
give
freer
scope
and
on
the
other
hand
to
the
common
life
which
may
thereby
be
weakened
or
broken
up
it
sometimes
seems
to
be
held
that
when
a
decided
majority
of
the
people
whose
voices
can
be
heard
in
a
more
or
less
defined
area
elect
to
live
for
the
future
under
a
particular
government
all
enlightened
men
elsewhere
would
wish
them
to
have
their
way
if
any
such
principle
could
be
accepted
without
qualification
few
movements
for
independence
would
ever
have
been
more
completely
justified
than
the
secession
of
the
southern
states
if
we
set
aside
the
highland
region
of
which
mention
has
already
been
made
in
the
six
states
which
first
seceded
and
in
several
of
those
which
followed
as
soon
as
it
was
clear
that
secession
would
be
resisted
the
preponderance
of
opinion
in
favour
of
the
movement
was
overwhelming
this
was
not
only
so
among
the
educated
and
governing
portions
of
society
which
were
interested
in
slavery
while
the
negroes
themselves
were
unorganised
and
dumb
and
made
no
stir
for
freedom
the
poorer
class
of
white
people
to
whom
the
institution
of
slavery
was
in
reality
oppressive
were
quite
unconscious
of
this
the
enslavement
of
the
negro
appeared
to
them
a
tribute
to
their
own
dignity
and
their
indiscriminating
spirit
of
independence
responded
enthusiastically
to
the
appeal
that
they
should
assert
themselves
against
the
real
or
fancied
pretensions
of
the
north
so
large
a
statement
would
require
some
qualification
if
we
were
here
concerned
with
the
life
of
a
southern
leader
and
there
was
of
course
a
brief
space
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
chapter
in
which
the
question
of
secession
hung
in
the
balance
and
it
is
true
in
this
as
in
every
case
that
the
men
who
gave
the
initial
push
were
few
but
broadly
speaking
it
is
certain
that
the
movement
for
secession
was
begun
with
at
least
as
general
an
enthusiasm
and
maintained
with
at
least
as
loyal
a
devotion
as
any
national
movement
with
which
it
can
be
compared
and
yet
just
years
after
the
consummation
of
its
failure
it
may
be
doubted
whether
one
soul
among
the
people
concerned
regrets
that
it
failed
english
people
from
that
time
to
this
have
found
the
statement
incredible
but
the
fact
is
that
this
imposing
movement
in
which
rich
and
poor
gentle
and
simple
astute
men
of
state
and
pious
clergymen
went
hand
in
hand
to
the
verge
of
ruin
and
beyond
was
undertaken
simply
and
solely
in
behalf
of
slavery
northern
writers
of
the
time
found
it
so
surprising
that
they
took
refuge
in
the
theory
of
conspiracy
alleging
that
a
handful
of
schemers
succeeded
by
the
help
of
fictitious
popular
clamour
and
intimidation
of
their
opponents
in
launching
the
south
upon
a
course
to
which
the
real
mind
of
the
people
was
averse
later
and
calmer
historical
survey
of
the
facts
has
completely
dispelled
this
view
and
the
english
suspicion
that
there
must
have
been
some
cause
beyond
and
above
slavery
for
desiring
independence
never
had
any
facts
to
support
it
since
no
exponent
of
southern
views
had
ever
hinted
at
secession
on
any
other
ground
than
slavery
every
southern
leader
declared
with
undoubted
truth
that
on
every
other
ground
he
prized
the
union
outside
south
carolina
every
southern
leader
made
an
earnest
attempt
before
he
surrendered
the
union
cause
to
secure
the
guarantees
he
thought
sufficient
for
slavery
within
the
union
the
southern
statesman
for
the
soldiers
were
not
statesmen
whose
character
most
attracts
sympathy
now
was
alexander
stephens
the
of
the
southern
confederacy
and
though
he
was
the
man
who
persisted
longest
in
the
view
that
slavery
could
be
adequately
secured
without
secession
he
was
none
the
less
entitled
to
speak
for
the
south
in
his
remarkable
words
on
the
constitution
adopted
by
the
southern
confederacy
the
new
constitution
has
put
at
rest
for
ever
all
the
agitating
questions
relating
to
our
peculiar
institution
african
slavery
this
was
the
immediate
cause
of
the
late
rupture
and
present
revolution
the
prevailing
ideas
entertained
by
jefferson
and
most
of
the
leading
statesmen
at
the
time
of
the
old
constitution
were
that
the
enslavement
of
the
african
was
wrong
in
principle
socially
morally
and
politically
our
new
government
is
founded
upon
exactly
the
opposite
idea
its
foundations
are
laid
its
corner
stone
rests
upon
the
great
truth
that
the
negro
is
not
the
equal
of
the
white
man
that
slavery
subordination
to
the
white
man
is
his
natural
and
normal
condition
this
our
new
government
is
the
first
in
the
history
of
the
world
based
upon
this
great
physical
philosophical
and
moral
truth
the
great
objects
of
humanity
are
best
attained
when
there
is
conformity
to
the
creator
laws
and
decrees
equally
explicit
and
void
of
shame
was
the
convention
of
the
state
of
mississippi
our
position
they
declared
is
thoroughly
identified
with
slavery
it
is
common
to
reproach
the
southern
leaders
with
reckless
folly
they
tried
to
destroy
the
union
which
they
really
valued
for
the
sake
of
slavery
which
they
valued
more
they
in
fact
destroyed
slavery
and
they
did
this
it
is
said
in
alarm
at
an
imaginary
danger
this
is
not
a
true
ground
of
reproach
to
them
it
is
true
that
the
danger
to
slavery
from
the
election
of
lincoln
was
not
immediately
pressing
he
neither
would
have
done
nor
could
have
done
more
than
to
prevent
during
his
four
years
of
office
any
new
acquisition
of
territory
in
the
interest
and
to
impose
his
veto
on
any
bill
extending
slavery
within
the
existing
territory
of
the
union
his
successor
after
four
years
might
or
might
not
have
been
he
did
not
seem
to
stand
for
any
overwhelming
force
in
american
politics
there
was
a
majority
opposed
to
him
in
both
houses
of
congress
a
great
majority
of
the
supreme
court
which
might
have
an
important
part
to
play
held
views
of
the
constitution
opposed
to
his
he
had
been
elected
by
a
minority
only
of
the
whole
american
people
why
could
not
the
southern
states
have
sat
still
secure
that
no
great
harm
would
happen
to
their
institution
for
the
present
and
hoping
that
their
former
ascendency
would
come
back
to
them
with
the
changing
fortunes
of
party
strife
this
is
an
argument
which
might
be
expected
to
have
weighed
with
southern
statesmen
if
each
of
them
had
been
anxious
merely
to
keep
up
the
value
of
his
own
slave
property
for
his
own
lifetime
but
this
was
far
from
being
their
case
it
is
hard
for
us
to
put
ourselves
at
the
point
of
view
of
men
who
could
sincerely
speak
of
their
property
in
negroes
as
theirs
by
the
decree
of
the
creator
but
it
is
certain
that
within
the
last
two
generations
trouble
of
mind
as
to
the
rightfulness
of
slavery
had
died
out
in
a
large
part
of
the
south
the
typical
southern
leader
valued
the
peculiar
form
of
society
under
which
he
lived
and
wished
to
hand
it
on
intact
to
his
children
children
if
their
preposterous
principle
be
granted
the
most
extreme
among
them
deserve
the
credit
of
statesmanlike
insight
for
having
seen
the
moment
that
lincoln
was
elected
that
they
must
strike
for
their
institution
now
if
they
wished
it
to
endure
the
convention
of
south
carolina
justly
observed
that
the
majority
in
the
north
had
voted
that
slavery
was
sinful
they
had
done
little
more
than
express
this
abstract
opinion
but
they
had
done
all
that
lincoln
administration
might
have
done
apparently
little
and
after
it
the
pendulum
would
probably
have
swung
back
but
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
is
the
most
delusive
of
political
phenomena
america
was
never
going
to
return
to
where
it
was
before
this
first
explicit
national
assertion
of
the
wrongfulness
of
slavery
had
been
made
it
would
have
been
hard
to
forecast
how
the
end
would
come
or
how
soon
but
the
end
was
certain
if
the
southern
states
had
elected
to
remain
the
countrymen
of
a
people
who
were
coming
to
regard
their
fundamental
institution
with
growing
reprobation
lincoln
had
said
this
government
can
not
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
lincoln
was
right
and
so
from
their
own
point
of
view
that
of
men
not
brave
or
wise
enough
to
take
in
hand
a
difficult
social
reform
were
the
leaders
who
declared
immediately
for
secession
in
no
other
contest
of
history
are
those
elements
in
human
affairs
on
which
tragic
dramatists
are
prone
to
dwell
so
clearly
marked
as
in
the
american
civil
war
no
unsophisticated
person
now
except
in
ignorance
as
to
the
cause
of
the
war
can
hesitate
as
to
which
side
enlists
his
sympathy
or
can
regard
the
victory
of
the
north
otherwise
than
as
the
costly
and
imperfect
triumph
of
the
right
but
the
wrong
side
emphatically
wrong
is
not
lacking
in
dignity
or
human
worth
the
agony
of
the
struggle
is
not
purely
horrible
to
contemplate
there
is
nothing
that
in
this
case
makes
us
reluctant
to
acknowledge
the
merits
of
the
men
who
took
arms
in
the
evil
cause
the
experience
as
to
the
relations
between
superior
and
inferior
races
which
is
now
at
the
command
of
every
intelligent
englishman
forbids
us
to
think
that
the
inferiority
of
the
negro
justified
slavery
but
it
also
forbids
us
to
fancy
that
men
to
whom
the
relation
of
owner
to
slave
had
become
natural
must
themselves
have
been
altogether
degraded
the
men
upon
the
southern
side
who
can
claim
any
special
admiration
were
simple
soldiers
who
had
no
share
in
causing
the
war
among
the
political
leaders
whom
they
served
there
was
none
who
stands
out
now
as
a
very
interesting
personality
and
their
chosen
chief
is
an
unattractive
figure
but
we
are
not
to
think
of
these
authors
of
the
war
as
a
gang
of
hardened
unscrupulous
corrupted
men
as
a
class
they
were
reputable
and
religious
men
they
served
their
cause
with
devotion
and
were
not
wholly
to
blame
that
they
chose
it
so
ill
the
responsibility
for
the
actual
secession
does
not
rest
in
an
especial
degree
on
any
individual
leader
secession
began
rather
with
the
spontaneous
movement
of
the
whole
community
of
south
carolina
and
in
the
states
which
followed
leading
politicians
expressed
rather
than
inspired
the
general
will
the
guilt
which
any
of
us
can
venture
to
attribute
for
this
action
of
a
whole
deluded
society
must
rest
on
men
like
calhoun
who
in
a
previous
generation
while
opinion
in
the
south
was
still
to
some
extent
unformed
stifled
all
thought
of
reform
and
gave
the
semblance
of
moral
and
intellectual
justification
to
a
system
only
susceptible
of
a
historical
excuse
the
south
was
neither
base
nor
senseless
but
it
was
wrong
to
some
minds
it
may
not
seem
to
follow
that
it
was
well
to
resist
it
by
war
and
indeed
at
the
time
as
often
happens
people
took
up
arms
with
greater
searchings
of
heart
upon
the
right
side
than
upon
the
wrong
if
the
slave
states
had
been
suffered
to
depart
in
peace
they
would
have
set
up
a
new
and
peculiar
political
society
more
truly
held
together
than
the
original
union
by
a
single
avowed
principle
a
nation
dedicated
to
the
inequality
of
men
it
is
not
really
possible
to
think
of
the
free
national
life
which
they
could
thus
have
initiated
as
a
thing
to
be
respected
and
preserved
nor
is
it
true
that
their
choice
for
themselves
of
this
dingy
freedom
was
no
concern
of
their
neighbours
we
have
seen
how
the
slave
interest
hankered
for
enlarged
dominion
and
it
is
certain
that
the
southern
confederacy
once
firmly
established
would
have
been
an
aggressive
and
disturbing
power
upon
the
continent
of
america
the
questions
of
territorial
and
other
rights
between
it
and
the
old
union
might
have
been
capable
of
satisfactory
settlement
for
the
moment
or
they
might
have
proved
as
insoluble
as
lincoln
thought
they
were
but
at
the
best
if
the
states
which
adhered
to
the
old
union
had
admitted
the
claim
of
the
first
seceding
states
to
go
they
could
only
have
retained
for
themselves
an
insecure
existence
as
a
nation
threatened
at
each
fresh
conflict
of
interest
or
sentiment
with
a
further
disruption
which
could
not
upon
any
principle
have
been
resisted
the
preceding
chapters
have
dwelt
with
iteration
upon
the
sentiments
which
had
operated
to
make
americans
a
people
and
on
the
form
and
the
degree
in
which
those
sentiments
animated
the
mind
of
lincoln
only
so
perhaps
can
we
fully
appreciate
for
what
the
people
of
the
north
fought
it
is
inaccurate
though
not
gravely
misleading
to
say
that
they
fought
against
slavery
it
would
be
wholly
false
to
say
that
they
fought
for
mere
dominion
they
fought
to
preserve
and
complete
a
political
unity
nobly
conceived
by
those
who
had
done
most
to
create
it
and
capable
as
the
sequel
showed
of
a
permanent
and
a
healthy
continuance
and
it
must
never
be
forgotten
if
we
wish
to
enter
into
the
spirit
which
sustained
the
north
in
its
struggle
that
loyalty
for
union
had
a
larger
aspect
than
that
of
mere
allegiance
to
a
particular
authority
vividly
present
to
the
mind
of
some
few
vaguely
but
honestly
present
to
the
mind
of
a
great
multitude
was
the
sense
that
even
had
slavery
not
entered
into
the
question
a
larger
cause
than
that
of
their
recent
union
was
bound
up
with
the
issues
of
the
war
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
been
the
first
and
most
famous
attempt
in
a
great
modern
country
to
secure
government
by
the
will
of
the
mass
of
the
people
if
in
this
crucial
instance
such
a
government
were
seen
to
be
intolerably
weak
if
it
was
found
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
powerful
minority
which
seized
a
occasion
to
rebel
what
they
had
learnt
to
think
the
most
hopeful
agency
for
the
uplifting
of
man
everywhere
would
for
ages
to
come
have
proved
a
failure
this
feeling
could
not
be
stronger
in
any
american
than
it
was
in
lincoln
himself
it
has
long
been
a
question
he
said
whether
any
government
which
is
not
too
strong
for
the
liberties
of
the
people
can
be
strong
enough
to
maintain
itself
there
is
one
marked
feature
of
his
patriotism
which
could
be
illustrated
by
abundance
of
phrases
from
his
speeches
and
letters
and
which
the
people
of
several
countries
of
europe
can
appreciate
his
affection
for
his
own
country
and
its
institutions
is
curiously
dependent
upon
a
wider
cause
of
human
good
and
is
not
a
whit
the
less
intense
for
that
there
is
perhaps
no
better
expression
of
this
widespread
feeling
in
the
north
than
the
unprepared
speech
which
he
delivered
on
his
way
to
become
president
in
the
hall
of
independence
at
philadelphia
in
which
the
declaration
of
independence
had
been
signed
i
have
never
he
said
had
a
feeling
politically
that
did
not
spring
from
the
sentiments
embodied
in
the
declaration
of
independence
i
have
often
pondered
over
the
dangers
which
were
incurred
by
the
men
who
assembled
here
and
framed
and
adopted
that
declaration
of
independence
i
have
pondered
over
the
toils
that
were
endured
by
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
army
who
achieved
that
independence
i
have
often
inquired
of
myself
what
great
principle
or
idea
it
was
that
kept
the
confederacy
so
long
together
it
was
not
the
mere
matter
of
separation
of
the
colonies
from
the
motherland
it
was
the
sentiment
in
the
declaration
of
independence
which
gave
liberty
not
alone
to
the
people
of
this
country
but
i
hope
to
the
world
for
all
future
time
it
was
that
which
gave
promise
that
in
due
time
the
weight
would
be
lifted
from
the
shoulders
of
all
men
progress
of
so
much
for
the
broad
causes
without
which
there
could
have
been
no
civil
war
in
america
we
have
now
to
sketch
the
process
by
which
the
fuel
was
kindled
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
president
elected
in
november
does
not
enter
upon
his
office
for
nearly
four
months
for
that
time
therefore
the
conduct
of
government
lay
in
the
hands
of
president
buchanan
who
for
all
his
past
subserviency
to
southern
interests
believed
and
said
that
secession
was
absolutely
unlawful
several
members
of
his
cabinet
were
southerners
who
favoured
secession
but
the
only
considerable
man
among
them
cobb
of
georgia
soon
declared
that
his
loyalty
to
his
own
state
was
not
compatible
with
his
office
and
resigned
and
though
others
including
the
secretary
for
war
hung
on
to
their
position
it
does
not
appear
that
they
influenced
buchanan
much
or
that
their
somewhat
dubious
conduct
while
they
remained
was
of
great
importance
black
the
and
cass
the
secretary
of
state
who
however
resigned
when
his
advice
was
disregarded
were
not
only
loyal
to
the
union
but
anxious
that
the
government
should
do
everything
that
seemed
necessary
in
its
defence
thus
this
administration
hitherto
southern
in
its
sympathies
must
be
regarded
for
its
remaining
months
as
standing
for
the
union
so
far
as
it
stood
for
anything
lincoln
meanwhile
had
little
that
he
could
do
but
to
watch
events
and
prepare
there
was
nevertheless
a
point
in
the
negotiations
which
took
place
between
parties
at
which
he
took
on
himself
a
tremendous
responsibility
and
at
which
his
action
was
probably
decisive
of
all
that
followed
the
presidential
election
took
place
on
november
on
november
the
legislature
of
south
carolina
which
had
remained
in
session
for
this
purpose
convened
a
specially
elected
convention
of
the
state
to
decide
upon
the
question
of
secession
slave
owners
and
poor
whites
young
and
old
street
rabble
persons
of
fashion
politicians
and
clergy
the
whole
people
of
this
peculiar
state
distinguished
in
some
marked
respects
even
from
its
nearest
neighbours
received
the
action
of
the
legislature
with
enthusiastic
but
grave
approval
it
was
not
till
december
that
the
convention
could
pass
its
formal
ordinance
of
secession
but
there
was
never
for
a
moment
any
doubt
as
to
what
it
would
do
the
question
was
what
other
states
would
follow
the
example
of
south
carolina
there
ensued
in
all
the
southern
states
earnest
discussion
as
to
whether
to
secede
or
not
and
in
the
north
on
which
the
action
of
south
carolina
however
easily
it
might
have
been
foretold
came
as
a
shock
great
bewilderment
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
as
has
been
said
there
was
in
the
south
generally
no
disposition
to
give
up
southern
claims
no
doubt
as
to
the
right
of
secession
and
no
fundamental
and
overriding
loyalty
to
the
union
but
there
was
a
considerable
reluctance
to
give
up
the
union
and
much
doubt
as
to
whether
secession
was
really
wise
there
was
in
the
north
among
those
who
then
made
themselves
heard
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
loyalty
due
to
the
union
but
there
was
apart
from
previous
differences
about
slavery
every
possible
variety
and
fluctuation
of
opinion
as
to
the
right
way
of
dealing
with
states
which
should
secede
or
rebel
in
certain
border
states
few
in
number
but
likely
to
play
an
important
part
in
civil
war
northern
and
southern
elements
were
mingled
amid
loud
and
distracted
discussion
public
and
private
leaders
of
the
several
parties
and
of
the
two
sections
of
the
country
conducted
earnest
negotiations
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
peaceable
settlement
and
when
congress
met
early
in
december
their
debates
took
a
formal
shape
in
committees
appointed
by
the
senate
and
by
the
house
meanwhile
the
president
was
called
upon
to
deal
with
the
problem
presented
for
the
executive
government
of
the
union
by
the
action
of
south
carolina
it
may
be
observed
that
if
he
had
given
his
mind
to
the
military
measures
required
to
meet
the
possible
future
the
north
which
in
the
end
had
his
entire
sympathy
would
have
begun
the
war
with
that
advantage
in
preparation
which
as
it
was
was
gained
by
the
south
in
this
respect
he
did
nothing
but
apart
from
this
if
he
had
taken
up
a
clear
and
comprehensible
attitude
towards
south
carolina
and
had
given
a
lead
to
unionist
sympathy
he
would
have
consolidated
public
opinion
in
the
north
and
he
would
have
greatly
strengthened
those
in
the
south
who
remained
averse
to
secession
there
would
have
been
a
considerable
further
secession
but
in
all
likelihood
it
would
not
have
become
so
formidable
as
it
did
as
it
was
the
movement
for
secession
proceeded
with
all
the
proud
confidence
that
can
be
felt
in
a
right
which
is
not
challenged
and
the
people
of
the
south
were
not
aware
though
shrewd
leaders
like
jefferson
davis
knew
it
well
of
the
risk
they
would
encounter
till
they
had
committed
themselves
to
defying
it
the
problem
before
buchanan
was
the
same
which
aggravated
by
his
failure
to
deal
with
it
confronted
lincoln
when
he
came
into
office
and
it
must
be
clearly
understood
the
secession
of
south
carolina
was
not
a
movement
which
could
at
once
be
quelled
by
prompt
measures
of
repression
even
if
sufficient
military
force
and
apt
forms
of
law
had
existed
for
taking
such
measures
they
would
have
united
the
south
in
support
of
south
carolina
and
alienated
the
north
which
was
anxious
for
conciliation
yet
it
was
possible
for
the
government
of
the
union
while
patiently
abstaining
from
violent
or
provocative
action
to
make
plain
that
in
the
last
resort
it
would
maintain
its
rights
in
south
carolina
with
its
full
strength
the
main
dealings
of
the
union
authorities
with
the
people
of
a
state
came
under
a
very
few
heads
there
were
local
federal
courts
to
try
certain
limited
classes
of
issues
jurors
of
course
could
not
be
compelled
to
serve
in
these
nor
parties
to
appear
there
was
the
postal
service
the
people
of
south
carolina
did
not
at
present
interfere
with
this
source
of
convenience
to
themselves
and
of
revenue
to
the
union
there
were
customs
duties
to
be
collected
at
the
ports
and
there
were
forts
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
in
charleston
south
carolina
as
well
as
forts
dockyards
and
arsenals
of
the
united
states
at
a
number
of
points
in
the
southern
states
the
government
should
quietly
but
openly
have
taken
steps
to
ensure
that
the
collection
should
go
on
unmolested
and
that
the
forts
and
the
like
should
be
made
safe
from
attack
in
south
carolina
and
everywhere
else
where
they
were
likely
to
be
threatened
measures
of
this
sort
were
early
urged
upon
buchanan
by
scott
the
that
is
second
in
command
under
the
president
of
the
army
who
had
been
the
officer
that
carried
out
jackson
military
dispositions
when
secession
was
threatened
in
south
carolina
thirty
years
before
and
by
other
officers
concerned
particularly
by
major
anderson
a
keen
southerner
but
a
keen
soldier
commanding
the
forts
at
charleston
and
by
cass
and
black
in
his
cabinet
public
opinion
in
the
north
demanded
such
measures
if
further
action
than
the
proper
manning
and
supply
of
certain
forts
had
been
in
contemplation
an
embarrassing
legal
question
would
have
arisen
in
the
opinion
of
the
of
leading
democrats
like
cass
and
douglas
and
apparently
of
most
legal
authorities
of
every
party
there
was
an
important
distinction
puzzling
to
an
english
lawyer
even
if
he
is
versed
in
the
american
constitution
between
the
steps
which
the
government
might
justly
take
in
and
measures
which
could
be
regarded
as
coercion
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
as
such
these
latter
would
be
unlawful
buchanan
instead
of
acting
on
or
declaring
his
intentions
entertained
congress
which
met
early
in
december
with
a
message
laying
down
very
clearly
the
illegality
of
secession
but
discussing
at
large
this
abstract
question
of
the
precise
powers
of
the
executive
in
resisting
secession
the
legal
question
will
not
further
concern
us
because
the
distinction
which
it
was
really
intended
to
draw
between
lawful
and
unlawful
measures
against
secession
quite
coincided
in
its
practical
application
with
what
common
sense
and
just
feeling
would
in
these
peculiar
circumstances
have
dictated
but
as
a
natural
consequence
of
such
discussion
an
impression
was
spread
abroad
of
the
illegality
of
something
vaguely
called
coercion
and
of
the
shadowy
nature
of
any
power
which
the
government
claimed
up
to
lincoln
inauguration
the
story
of
the
charleston
forts
of
which
one
lying
on
an
island
in
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
was
the
famous
fort
sumter
is
briefly
this
buchanan
was
early
informed
that
if
the
union
government
desired
to
hold
them
troops
and
ships
of
war
should
instantly
be
sent
congressmen
from
south
carolina
remaining
in
washington
came
to
him
and
represented
that
their
state
regarded
these
forts
upon
its
soil
as
their
own
they
gave
assurances
that
there
would
be
no
attack
on
the
forts
if
the
existing
military
situation
was
not
altered
and
they
tried
to
get
a
promise
that
the
forts
should
not
be
reinforced
buchanan
would
give
them
no
promise
but
he
equally
refused
the
entreaties
of
scott
and
his
own
principal
ministers
that
he
should
reinforce
the
forts
because
he
declared
that
this
would
precipitate
a
conflict
towards
the
end
of
the
year
major
anderson
not
having
men
enough
to
hold
all
the
forts
if
as
he
expected
they
were
attacked
withdrew
his
whole
force
to
fort
sumter
which
he
thought
the
most
defensible
dismantling
the
principal
other
fort
the
governor
of
south
carolina
protested
against
this
as
a
violation
of
a
supposed
understanding
with
the
president
and
seized
upon
the
united
states
arsenal
and
the
custom
house
taking
the
revenue
officers
into
state
service
commissioners
had
previously
gone
from
south
carolina
to
washington
to
request
the
surrender
of
the
forts
upon
terms
of
payment
for
property
they
now
declared
that
withdrawal
as
putting
him
in
a
better
position
for
defence
was
an
act
of
war
and
demanded
that
he
should
be
ordered
to
retire
to
the
mainland
buchanan
wavered
decided
to
yield
to
them
on
this
last
point
ultimately
on
the
last
day
of
yielded
instead
to
severe
pressure
from
black
and
decided
to
reinforce
anderson
on
fort
sumter
the
actual
attempt
to
reinforce
him
was
bungled
a
transport
sent
for
this
purpose
was
fired
upon
by
the
south
carolina
forces
and
returned
idle
this
first
act
of
war
for
some
curious
reason
caused
no
excitement
the
people
of
the
north
were
intensely
relieved
that
buchanan
had
not
yielded
to
whatever
south
carolina
might
demand
and
being
prone
to
forgive
and
to
applaud
seem
for
a
time
to
have
experienced
a
thrill
of
glory
in
the
thought
that
the
national
administration
had
a
mind
dix
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
elated
them
yet
further
by
telegraphing
to
a
treasury
official
at
new
orleans
if
any
one
attempts
to
haul
down
the
american
flag
shoot
him
on
the
spot
but
anderson
remained
without
reinforcements
or
further
provisions
when
lincoln
entered
office
and
troops
in
the
service
first
of
south
carolina
and
afterwards
of
the
southern
confederacy
which
was
formed
in
february
erected
batteries
and
prepared
to
bombard
fort
sumter
no
possible
plea
for
president
buchanan
can
make
him
rank
among
those
who
have
held
high
office
with
any
credit
at
all
but
he
must
at
once
be
acquitted
of
any
intentional
treachery
to
the
union
it
is
agreed
that
he
was
a
truthful
and
sincere
man
and
there
is
something
pleasant
in
the
simple
avowal
he
made
to
a
southern
negotiator
who
was
pressing
him
for
some
instant
concession
that
he
always
said
his
prayers
before
deciding
any
important
matter
of
state
his
previous
dealings
with
kansas
would
suggest
to
us
robust
unscrupulousness
but
it
seems
that
he
had
quite
given
his
judgment
over
into
the
keeping
of
a
little
group
of
southern
senators
now
that
he
was
deprived
of
this
help
he
had
only
enough
will
left
to
be
obstinate
against
other
advice
it
is
suggested
that
he
had
now
but
one
motive
the
desire
that
the
struggle
should
break
out
in
his
successor
time
rather
than
his
own
even
this
is
perhaps
to
judge
buchanan
notorious
and
calamitous
laches
unfairly
any
action
that
he
took
must
to
a
certain
extent
have
been
provocative
and
he
knew
it
and
he
may
have
clung
to
the
hope
that
by
sheer
inaction
he
would
give
time
for
some
possible
forces
of
reason
and
conciliation
to
work
if
so
he
was
wrong
but
similar
and
about
as
foolish
hopes
paralysed
cabinet
and
to
a
less
but
still
very
dangerous
degree
lincoln
himself
when
they
took
up
the
problem
which
buchanan
neglect
had
made
more
urgent
buchanan
had
in
this
instance
the
advantage
of
far
better
advice
but
this
silly
old
man
must
not
be
gibbeted
and
lincoln
left
free
from
criticism
for
his
part
in
the
same
transaction
both
presidents
hesitated
where
to
us
who
look
back
the
case
seems
clear
the
circumstances
had
altered
in
some
respects
when
lincoln
came
in
but
it
is
only
upon
a
somewhat
broad
survey
of
the
governing
tendencies
of
lincoln
administration
and
of
its
mighty
result
in
the
mass
that
we
discover
what
really
distinguishes
his
slowness
of
action
in
such
cases
as
this
from
the
hesitation
of
a
man
like
buchanan
buchanan
waited
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
action
lincoln
with
the
firm
intention
to
see
his
path
in
the
fullest
light
he
could
get
from
an
early
date
in
november
every
effort
was
made
by
men
too
numerous
to
mention
to
devise
if
possible
such
a
settlement
of
what
were
now
called
the
grievances
of
the
south
as
would
prevent
any
other
state
from
following
the
example
of
south
carolina
apart
from
the
intangible
difference
presented
by
much
disapprobation
of
slavery
in
the
north
and
growing
resentment
in
the
south
as
this
disapprobation
grew
louder
the
solid
ground
of
dispute
concerned
the
position
of
slavery
in
the
existing
territories
and
future
acquisitions
of
the
united
states
government
the
quarrel
arose
from
the
election
of
a
president
pledged
to
use
whatever
power
he
had
though
indeed
that
might
prove
little
to
prevent
the
further
extension
of
slavery
and
we
may
almost
confine
our
attention
to
this
point
other
points
came
into
discussion
several
of
the
northern
states
had
personal
liberty
laws
expressly
devised
to
impede
the
execution
of
the
federal
law
of
as
to
fugitive
slaves
some
attention
was
devoted
to
these
especially
by
alexander
stephens
who
as
the
southern
leader
most
opposed
to
immediate
secession
wished
to
direct
men
minds
to
a
grievance
that
could
be
remedied
lincoln
who
had
always
said
that
though
the
fugitive
slave
law
should
be
made
just
and
seemly
it
ought
in
substance
to
be
enforced
made
clear
again
that
he
thought
such
personal
liberty
laws
should
be
amended
though
he
protested
that
it
was
not
for
him
as
to
advise
the
state
legislatures
on
their
own
business
the
republicans
generally
agreed
some
of
the
states
concerned
actually
began
amending
their
laws
thus
if
the
disquiet
of
the
south
had
depended
on
this
grievance
the
cause
of
disquiet
would
no
doubt
have
been
removed
again
the
republican
leaders
including
lincoln
in
particular
let
there
be
no
ground
for
thinking
that
an
attack
was
intended
upon
slavery
in
the
states
where
it
was
established
they
offered
eventually
to
give
the
most
solemn
pledge
possible
in
this
matter
by
passing
an
amendment
of
the
constitution
declaring
that
it
should
never
be
altered
so
as
to
take
away
the
independence
of
the
existing
slave
states
as
to
this
portion
of
their
democratic
institutions
lincoln
indeed
refused
on
several
occasions
to
make
any
fresh
public
disclaimer
of
an
intention
to
attack
existing
institutions
his
views
were
open
to
all
who
will
read
for
the
good
men
in
the
south
he
writes
privately
i
regard
the
majority
of
them
as
such
i
have
no
objection
to
repeat
them
seventy
times
seven
but
i
have
bad
men
to
deal
with
both
north
and
south
men
who
are
eager
for
something
new
upon
which
to
base
new
misrepresentations
men
who
would
like
to
frighten
me
or
at
least
fix
upon
me
the
character
of
timidity
and
cowardice
nevertheless
he
endeavoured
constantly
in
private
correspondence
to
narrow
and
define
the
issue
which
as
he
insisted
concerned
only
the
territorial
extension
of
slavery
the
most
serious
of
the
negotiations
that
took
place
and
to
which
most
hope
was
attached
consisted
in
the
deliberations
of
a
committee
of
thirteen
appointed
by
the
senate
in
december
which
took
for
its
guidance
a
detailed
scheme
of
compromise
put
forward
by
senator
crittenden
of
kentucky
the
efforts
of
this
committee
to
come
to
an
agreement
broke
down
at
the
outset
upon
the
question
of
the
territories
and
the
responsibility
for
good
or
for
evil
of
bringing
them
to
an
end
must
probably
be
attributed
to
the
advice
of
lincoln
crittenden
first
proposal
was
that
there
should
be
a
constitutional
amendment
declaring
that
slavery
should
be
prohibited
in
all
the
territory
of
the
united
states
now
held
or
hereafter
acquired
north
of
latitude
degrees
minutes
the
limit
fixed
in
the
missouri
compromise
but
restricted
then
to
the
louisiana
purchase
while
in
all
territory
now
held
or
thereafter
acquired
south
of
that
line
it
should
be
permitted
crittenden
also
proposed
that
when
a
territory
on
either
side
of
the
line
became
a
state
it
should
become
free
to
decide
the
question
for
itself
but
the
discussion
never
reached
this
point
on
the
proposal
as
to
the
territories
there
seemed
at
first
to
be
a
prospect
that
the
republicans
would
agree
in
which
case
the
south
might
very
likely
have
agreed
too
the
desire
for
peace
was
intensely
strong
among
the
commercial
men
of
new
york
and
other
cities
and
it
affected
the
great
political
managers
and
the
statesmen
who
like
seward
himself
were
in
close
touch
with
this
commercial
influence
tenacious
adherence
to
declared
principle
may
have
been
as
strong
in
country
districts
as
the
desire
for
accommodation
was
in
these
cities
but
it
was
at
any
rate
far
less
vocal
and
on
the
whole
it
seems
that
compromise
was
then
in
the
air
it
seemed
clear
from
the
expressed
opinions
of
his
closest
allies
that
seward
would
support
this
compromise
now
seward
just
at
this
time
received
lincoln
offer
of
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
a
great
office
and
one
in
which
seward
expected
to
rule
lincoln
and
the
country
but
in
accepting
which
as
he
did
he
made
it
incumbent
on
himself
not
to
part
company
at
once
with
the
man
who
would
be
nominally
his
chief
then
there
occurred
a
visit
paid
on
seward
behalf
by
his
friend
thurlow
weed
an
astute
political
manager
but
also
an
able
statesman
to
lincoln
at
springfield
weed
brought
back
a
written
statement
of
lincoln
views
seward
support
was
not
given
to
the
compromise
nor
naturally
was
that
of
the
more
radical
republicans
to
use
a
term
which
now
became
common
and
the
committee
of
thirteen
found
itself
unable
to
agree
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
what
lincoln
conviction
on
this
to
him
the
one
essential
point
of
policy
was
or
to
quote
from
the
numerous
letters
in
which
from
the
time
of
his
nomination
he
tried
to
keep
the
minds
of
his
friends
firm
on
this
single
principle
and
to
show
them
that
if
there
were
the
slightest
further
yielding
as
to
this
save
indeed
as
to
the
peculiar
case
of
new
mexico
which
did
not
matter
and
which
perhaps
he
regarded
as
conceded
already
the
southern
policy
of
extending
slavery
and
of
filibustering
against
neighbouring
counties
for
that
purpose
would
revive
in
full
force
and
the
whole
labour
of
the
republican
movement
would
have
to
begin
over
again
since
his
election
he
had
been
writing
also
to
southern
politicians
who
were
personally
friendly
to
gilmer
of
north
carolina
to
whom
he
offered
cabinet
office
and
to
stephens
making
absolutely
plain
that
his
difference
with
them
lay
in
this
one
point
but
making
it
no
less
plain
that
on
this
point
he
was
with
entire
respect
to
them
immovable
now
on
december
the
york
was
enabled
to
state
that
lincoln
stands
now
as
he
stood
in
may
last
square
upon
the
republican
platform
the
writing
that
weed
brought
to
seward
must
have
said
perhaps
more
elaborately
the
same
if
lincoln
had
not
stood
square
upon
that
platform
there
were
others
like
senator
wade
of
ohio
and
senator
grimes
of
iowa
who
might
have
done
so
and
might
have
been
able
to
wreck
the
compromise
lincoln
however
did
wreck
it
at
a
time
when
it
seemed
likely
to
succeed
and
it
is
most
probable
that
thereby
he
caused
the
civil
war
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
definitely
expected
the
civil
war
probably
he
avoided
making
any
definite
forecast
but
he
expressed
no
alarm
and
he
privately
told
a
friend
about
this
time
that
he
could
not
in
his
heart
believe
that
the
south
designed
the
overthrow
of
the
government
but
if
he
had
in
his
heart
believed
it
nothing
in
his
life
gives
reason
to
think
that
he
would
have
been
more
anxious
to
conciliate
the
south
on
the
contrary
it
is
in
line
with
all
we
know
of
his
feelings
to
suppose
that
he
would
have
thought
firmness
all
the
more
imperative
we
can
not
recall
the
solemnity
of
his
speech
about
a
house
divided
against
itself
with
which
all
his
words
and
acts
accorded
without
seeing
that
if
perhaps
he
speculated
little
about
the
risks
he
was
prepared
to
face
them
whatever
they
were
doubtless
he
took
a
heavy
responsibility
but
it
is
painful
to
find
honourable
historians
who
heartily
dislike
the
cause
of
slavery
capable
of
wondering
whether
he
was
right
to
do
so
if
he
had
not
stood
square
in
december
upon
the
same
platform
on
which
he
had
stood
in
may
if
he
had
preferred
to
enroll
himself
among
those
statesmen
of
all
countries
whose
strongest
words
are
uttered
for
their
own
subsequent
enjoyment
in
eating
them
he
might
conceivably
have
saved
much
bloodshed
but
he
would
not
have
left
the
united
states
a
country
of
which
any
good
man
was
proud
to
be
a
citizen
thus
by
the
end
of
the
bottom
was
really
out
of
the
policy
of
compromise
and
it
is
not
worth
while
to
examine
the
praiseworthy
efforts
that
were
still
made
for
it
while
state
after
state
in
the
south
was
deciding
to
secede
one
interesting
proposal
which
was
aired
in
january
deserves
notice
namely
that
the
terms
of
compromise
proposed
by
crittenden
should
have
been
submitted
to
a
vote
of
the
whole
people
it
was
not
passed
seward
whom
many
people
now
thought
likely
to
catch
at
any
and
every
proposal
for
a
settlement
said
afterwards
with
justice
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
ineffectual
ineffectual
it
would
have
been
in
this
sense
the
compromise
would
in
all
probability
have
been
carried
by
a
majority
consisting
of
men
in
the
border
states
and
of
all
those
elsewhere
who
though
they
feared
war
and
desired
good
feeling
had
no
further
definite
opinion
upon
the
chief
questions
at
issue
but
it
would
have
left
a
local
majority
in
many
of
the
southern
states
and
a
local
majority
in
many
of
the
northern
states
as
irreconcilable
with
each
other
as
ever
it
was
opposed
also
to
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
in
a
great
country
where
the
people
with
infinitely
varied
interests
and
opinions
can
slowly
make
their
predominant
wishes
appear
but
can
not
really
take
counsel
together
and
give
a
firm
decision
upon
any
emergency
there
may
be
exceptional
cases
when
a
popular
vote
on
a
defined
issue
would
be
valuable
significant
desired
by
the
people
themselves
but
the
machinery
of
representative
government
however
faulty
is
the
only
machinery
by
which
the
people
can
in
some
sense
govern
itself
instead
of
making
itself
ungovernable
above
all
in
a
serious
crisis
it
is
supremely
repugnant
to
the
spirit
of
popular
government
that
the
men
chosen
by
a
people
to
govern
it
should
throw
their
responsibility
back
at
the
heads
of
the
electors
it
is
well
to
be
clear
as
to
the
kind
of
proceeding
which
the
authors
of
this
proposal
were
really
advocating
a
statesman
has
come
before
the
ordinary
citizen
with
a
definite
statement
of
the
principle
on
which
he
would
act
and
an
ordinary
citizen
has
thereupon
taken
his
part
in
entrusting
him
with
power
then
comes
the
moment
for
the
statesman
to
carry
out
his
principle
and
the
latent
opposition
becomes
of
necessity
more
alarming
the
statesman
is
therefore
to
say
to
the
ordinary
citizen
this
is
a
more
difficult
matter
than
i
thought
and
if
i
am
to
act
as
i
said
i
would
take
on
yourself
the
responsibility
which
i
recently
put
myself
forward
to
bear
the
ordinary
citizen
will
naturally
as
a
rule
decline
a
responsibility
thus
offered
him
but
he
will
not
be
grateful
for
the
offer
or
glad
to
be
a
forced
accomplice
in
this
process
of
indecision
if
we
could
determine
the
prevailing
sentiment
in
the
north
at
some
particular
moment
during
the
crisis
it
would
probably
represent
what
very
few
individual
men
continued
to
think
for
six
months
together
early
in
the
crisis
some
strong
opponents
of
slavery
were
for
letting
the
south
go
declaring
as
did
horace
greeley
of
the
york
that
they
would
not
be
citizens
of
a
republic
of
which
one
part
was
pinned
to
the
other
part
with
bayonets
but
this
sentiment
seems
soon
to
have
given
way
when
the
same
men
began
to
consider
as
lincoln
had
considered
whether
an
agreement
to
sever
the
union
between
the
states
with
the
difficult
adjustment
of
mutual
interests
which
it
would
have
involved
could
be
so
effected
as
to
secure
a
lasting
peace
a
blind
rage
on
behalf
of
conciliation
broke
out
later
in
prosperous
business
men
in
great
towns
even
in
boston
it
is
related
that
beacon
street
aristocrats
broke
up
a
meeting
to
commemorate
john
brown
on
the
anniversary
of
his
death
and
grave
persons
thought
the
meeting
an
outrage
waves
of
eager
desire
for
compromise
passed
over
the
northern
community
observers
at
the
time
and
historians
after
are
easily
mistaken
as
to
popular
feeling
the
acute
fluctuations
of
opinion
inevitable
among
journalists
and
in
any
sort
of
circle
where
men
are
constantly
meeting
and
talking
politics
may
leave
the
great
mass
of
quiet
folk
almost
unaffected
we
may
be
sure
that
there
was
a
considerable
body
of
steady
opinion
very
much
in
accord
with
lincoln
this
should
not
be
forgotten
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
it
prevailed
constantly
on
the
contrary
it
was
inherent
in
the
nature
of
the
crisis
that
opinion
wavered
and
swayed
we
should
miss
the
whole
significance
of
lincoln
story
if
we
did
not
think
of
the
north
now
and
to
the
end
of
the
war
as
exposed
to
disunion
hesitation
and
quick
reaction
if
at
this
time
a
sufficiently
authoritative
leader
with
sufficiently
determined
timidity
had
inaugurated
a
policy
of
stampede
he
might
have
had
a
vast
and
tumultuous
following
only
his
following
would
quickly
if
too
late
have
repented
what
was
wanted
if
the
people
of
the
north
were
to
have
what
most
justly
might
be
called
their
way
was
a
leader
who
would
not
seem
to
hurry
them
along
nor
yet
be
ever
looking
round
to
see
if
they
followed
but
just
go
groping
forward
among
the
innumerable
obstacles
guided
by
such
principles
of
good
sense
and
of
right
as
would
perhaps
on
the
whole
and
in
the
long
run
be
approved
by
the
maturer
thought
of
most
men
and
lincoln
was
such
a
leader
when
we
turn
to
the
south
where
as
has
been
said
the
movement
for
secession
was
making
steady
though
not
unopposed
progress
we
have
indeed
to
make
exceptions
to
any
sweeping
statement
but
we
must
recognise
a
far
more
clearly
defined
and
far
more
prevailing
general
opinion
we
may
set
aside
for
the
moment
the
border
slave
states
of
maryland
virginia
kentucky
and
missouri
each
of
which
has
a
distinct
and
an
important
history
delaware
belonged
in
effect
to
the
north
in
texas
there
were
peculiar
conditions
and
texas
had
an
interesting
history
of
its
own
in
this
matter
but
may
be
treated
as
remote
there
was
also
as
has
been
said
a
highland
region
covering
the
west
of
virginia
and
the
east
of
kentucky
but
reaching
far
south
into
the
northern
part
of
alabama
looking
at
the
pathetic
spectacle
of
enduring
heroism
in
a
mistaken
cause
which
the
south
presented
many
people
have
been
ready
to
suppose
that
it
was
manoeuvred
and
tricked
into
its
folly
by
its
politicians
and
might
have
recovered
itself
from
it
if
the
north
and
the
government
had
exercised
greater
patience
and
given
it
time
in
support
of
this
view
instances
are
cited
of
strong
unionist
feeling
in
the
south
such
instances
probably
belong
to
the
peculiar
people
of
this
highland
country
or
else
to
the
mixed
and
more
or
less
neutral
population
that
might
be
found
at
new
orleans
or
trading
along
the
mississippi
there
remains
a
solid
and
far
larger
south
in
which
indeed
except
for
south
carolina
dominant
southern
policy
was
briskly
debated
but
as
a
question
of
time
degree
and
expediency
three
mental
forces
worked
for
the
same
end
the
alarmed
vested
interest
of
the
people
of
substance
aristocratic
and
otherwise
the
racial
sentiment
of
the
poor
whites
a
sentiment
often
strongest
in
those
who
have
no
subject
of
worldly
pride
but
their
colour
and
the
philosophy
of
the
clergy
and
other
professional
men
who
constituted
what
in
some
countries
is
called
the
intellectual
class
these
influences
resulted
in
a
rare
uniformity
of
opinion
that
slavery
was
right
and
all
attacks
on
it
were
monstrous
that
the
southern
states
were
free
to
secede
and
form
if
they
chose
a
new
confederacy
and
that
they
ought
to
do
this
if
the
moment
should
arrive
when
they
could
not
otherwise
safeguard
their
interests
doubtless
there
were
leading
men
who
had
thought
over
the
matter
in
advance
of
the
rest
and
taken
counsel
together
long
before
but
the
fact
seems
to
be
that
such
leaders
now
found
their
followers
in
advance
of
them
jefferson
davis
by
far
the
most
commanding
man
among
them
now
found
himself
certainly
it
served
him
right
anxiously
counselling
delay
and
spending
nights
in
prayer
before
he
made
his
farewell
speech
to
the
senate
in
words
of
greater
dignity
and
good
feeling
than
seem
to
comport
with
the
fanatical
narrowness
of
his
view
and
the
progressive
warping
of
his
determined
character
to
which
it
condemned
him
whatever
fundamental
loyalty
to
the
union
existed
in
any
man
heart
there
were
months
of
debate
in
which
it
found
no
organised
and
hardly
any
audible
expression
the
most
notable
stand
against
actual
secession
was
that
which
was
made
in
georgia
by
stephens
he
was
determined
and
outspoken
but
he
proceeded
wholly
upon
the
ground
that
secession
was
premature
and
this
instance
is
significant
of
something
further
it
has
been
said
that
discussion
and
voting
were
not
free
and
it
would
be
altogether
unlikely
that
their
freedom
should
in
no
cases
be
infringed
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
charge
was
widely
true
it
is
surely
significant
of
the
general
temper
of
the
south
and
most
honourable
to
it
that
stephens
who
thus
struggled
against
secession
at
that
moment
was
chosen
of
the
southern
confederacy
by
february
the
states
of
mississippi
florida
alabama
georgia
and
louisiana
had
followed
south
carolina
by
passing
ordinances
of
secession
and
on
that
date
representatives
of
these
states
met
at
montgomery
in
alabama
to
found
a
new
confederacy
texas
where
considerable
resistance
was
offered
by
governor
houston
the
adventurous
leader
under
whom
that
state
had
separated
from
mexico
was
in
process
of
passing
the
like
ordinance
virginia
and
north
carolina
which
lie
north
of
the
region
where
cotton
prevails
and
with
them
their
western
neighbour
tennessee
and
arkansas
yet
further
west
and
separated
from
tennessee
by
the
mississippi
river
did
not
secede
till
after
inauguration
and
the
outbreak
of
war
but
the
position
of
virginia
except
for
its
western
districts
admitted
of
very
little
doubt
and
that
of
tennessee
and
north
carolina
was
known
to
be
much
the
same
virginia
took
a
historic
pride
in
the
union
and
its
interest
in
slavery
was
not
quite
the
same
as
that
of
the
cotton
states
yet
its
strongest
social
ties
were
to
the
south
this
state
was
now
engaged
in
a
last
idle
attempt
to
keep
itself
and
other
border
states
in
the
union
with
some
hope
also
that
the
departed
states
might
return
and
on
this
same
february
a
peace
convention
invited
by
virginia
and
attended
by
delegates
from
states
met
at
washington
with
tyler
in
the
chair
but
for
virginia
it
was
all
along
a
condition
of
any
terms
of
agreement
that
the
right
of
any
state
to
secede
should
be
fully
acknowledged
the
congress
of
the
seceding
states
which
met
at
montgomery
was
described
by
stephens
as
taken
all
in
all
the
noblest
soberest
most
intelligent
and
most
conservative
body
i
was
ever
in
it
has
been
remarked
that
southern
politicians
of
the
agitator
type
were
not
sent
to
it
it
adopted
a
provisional
constitution
modelled
largely
upon
that
of
the
united
states
jefferson
davis
who
had
retired
to
his
farm
was
sent
for
to
become
president
stephens
as
already
said
became
the
delegates
there
were
to
continue
in
session
for
the
present
as
the
regular
congress
whether
sobered
by
the
thought
that
they
were
acting
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
or
in
accordance
with
their
own
prevailing
sentiment
these
men
some
of
whom
had
before
urged
the
revival
of
the
slave
trade
now
placed
in
their
constitution
a
perpetual
prohibition
of
it
and
when
as
a
regular
legislature
they
afterwards
passed
a
penal
statute
which
carried
out
this
intention
inadequately
president
davis
conscientiously
vetoed
it
and
demanded
a
more
satisfactory
measure
at
his
inauguration
the
southern
president
delivered
an
address
typical
of
that
curious
blending
of
propriety
and
insincerity
of
which
the
politics
of
that
period
in
america
had
offered
many
examples
it
may
seem
incredible
but
it
contained
no
word
of
slavery
but
recited
in
dignified
terms
how
the
south
had
been
driven
to
separation
by
wanton
aggression
on
the
part
of
others
and
after
it
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
secure
tranquillity
the
new
southern
congress
now
resolved
to
take
over
the
forts
and
other
property
in
the
seceded
states
that
had
belonged
to
the
union
and
the
first
confederate
general
beauregard
was
sent
to
charleston
to
hover
over
fort
sumter
inauguration
of
the
first
necessary
business
of
the
while
he
watched
the
gathering
of
what
emerson
named
the
hurricane
in
which
he
was
called
to
the
helm
was
to
construct
a
strong
cabinet
to
which
may
be
added
the
seemingly
unnecessary
business
forced
upon
him
of
dealing
with
a
horde
of
pilgrims
who
at
once
began
visiting
him
to
solicit
some
office
or
in
rarer
cases
to
press
their
disinterested
opinions
his
cabinet
designed
in
principle
as
has
been
said
while
he
was
waiting
in
the
telegraph
office
for
election
returns
was
actually
constructed
with
some
delay
and
hesitation
lincoln
could
not
know
personally
all
the
men
he
invited
to
join
him
but
he
proceeded
with
the
view
of
conjoining
in
his
administration
representatives
of
the
chief
shades
of
opinion
which
in
this
critical
time
it
would
be
his
supreme
duty
to
hold
together
not
only
different
shades
of
opinion
but
the
local
sentiment
of
different
districts
had
to
be
considered
he
once
complained
that
if
the
twelve
apostles
had
to
be
chosen
nowadays
the
principle
of
locality
would
have
to
be
regarded
but
at
this
time
there
was
very
solid
reason
why
different
states
should
be
contented
and
why
he
should
be
advised
as
to
their
feelings
his
own
chief
rivals
for
the
presidency
offered
a
good
choice
from
both
these
points
of
view
they
were
seward
of
new
york
chase
of
ohio
bates
of
missouri
cameron
of
pennsylvania
seward
and
chase
were
both
able
and
outstanding
men
the
former
was
in
a
sense
the
old
republican
leader
but
was
more
and
more
coming
to
be
regarded
as
the
typical
conservative
or
cautious
republican
chase
on
the
other
hand
was
a
leader
of
the
radicals
who
were
stern
and
unbending
in
their
attitude
towards
slavery
and
towards
the
south
these
two
must
be
got
and
kept
together
if
possible
bates
was
a
good
and
capable
man
who
moreover
came
from
missouri
a
border
slave
state
where
his
influence
was
much
to
be
desired
he
became
cameron
an
unfortunate
choice
as
it
turned
out
was
a
very
wealthy
business
man
of
pennsylvania
representative
of
the
weighty
protectionist
influence
there
after
he
had
been
offered
office
which
had
been
without
lincoln
authority
promised
him
in
the
republican
convention
lincoln
was
dismayed
by
representations
that
he
was
a
bad
corrupted
man
he
wrote
a
curious
letter
asking
cameron
to
refuse
his
offer
cameron
instead
produced
evidence
of
the
desire
of
pennsylvania
for
him
lincoln
stuck
to
his
offer
the
old
whig
element
among
republicans
the
protectionist
element
and
above
all
the
friends
of
the
indispensable
seward
would
otherwise
have
been
outweighted
in
the
cabinet
cameron
eventually
became
for
a
time
secretary
of
war
to
these
lincoln
upon
somebody
strong
representations
tried
without
much
hope
to
add
some
distinctly
southern
politician
the
effort
of
course
failed
ultimately
the
cabinet
was
completed
by
the
addition
of
caleb
smith
of
indiana
as
secretary
of
the
interior
gideon
welles
of
connecticut
as
secretary
of
the
navy
and
montgomery
blair
of
maryland
as
welles
with
the
guidance
of
a
brilliant
subordinate
fox
served
usefully
was
very
loyal
to
lincoln
had
an
antipathy
to
england
which
was
dangerous
and
kept
very
diligently
a
diary
for
which
we
may
be
grateful
now
blair
was
a
vehement
irresponsible
person
with
an
influential
connection
and
which
was
important
his
influence
and
that
of
his
family
lay
in
maryland
and
other
border
slave
states
of
all
these
men
seward
secretary
of
state
that
is
foreign
minister
and
something
more
and
chase
secretary
of
the
treasury
most
concern
us
lincoln
offer
to
seward
was
made
and
accepted
in
terms
that
did
credit
to
both
men
and
seward
still
smarting
at
his
own
defeat
was
admirably
loyal
but
his
friends
though
they
had
secured
the
appointment
of
cameron
to
support
them
thought
increasingly
ill
of
the
prospects
of
a
cabinet
which
included
the
radical
chase
on
the
very
night
before
his
inauguration
lincoln
received
from
seward
who
had
just
been
helping
to
revise
his
inaugural
address
a
letter
withdrawing
his
acceptance
of
office
by
some
not
clearly
recorded
exercise
of
that
great
power
over
men
which
if
with
some
failures
was
generally
at
his
command
he
forced
seward
to
see
that
the
unconditional
withdrawal
of
this
letter
was
his
public
duty
it
must
throughout
what
follows
be
remembered
that
lincoln
first
and
most
constant
duty
was
to
hold
together
the
jarring
elements
in
the
north
which
these
jarring
elements
in
his
own
cabinet
represented
and
it
was
one
of
his
great
achievements
that
he
kept
together
for
as
long
as
was
needful
able
but
discordant
public
servants
who
could
never
have
combined
together
without
him
on
february
lincoln
standing
on
the
gallery
at
the
end
of
a
railway
car
upon
the
instant
of
departure
from
the
home
to
which
he
never
returned
said
to
his
old
neighbours
according
to
the
version
of
his
speech
which
his
private
secretary
got
him
to
dictate
immediately
after
my
friends
no
one
not
in
my
situation
can
appreciate
my
feeling
of
sadness
at
this
parting
to
this
place
and
the
kindness
of
these
people
i
owe
everything
here
i
have
lived
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
have
passed
from
a
young
to
an
old
man
here
my
children
have
been
born
and
one
is
buried
i
now
leave
not
knowing
when
or
whether
ever
i
may
return
with
a
task
before
me
greater
than
that
which
rested
upon
washington
without
the
assistance
of
that
divine
being
who
ever
attended
him
i
can
not
succeed
with
that
assistance
i
can
not
fail
trusting
in
him
who
can
go
with
me
and
remain
with
you
and
be
everywhere
for
good
let
us
confidently
hope
that
all
will
yet
be
well
to
his
care
commending
you
as
i
hope
in
your
prayers
you
will
commend
me
i
bid
you
an
affectionate
farewell
he
was
indeed
going
to
a
task
not
less
great
than
washington
but
he
was
going
to
it
with
a
preparation
in
many
respects
far
inferior
to
his
for
the
last
eight
years
he
had
laboured
as
a
public
speaker
and
in
a
measure
as
a
party
leader
and
had
displayed
and
developed
comprehension
perhaps
unequalled
of
some
of
the
larger
causes
which
mould
public
affairs
but
except
in
sheer
moral
discipline
those
years
had
done
nothing
to
supply
the
special
training
which
he
had
previously
lacked
for
high
executive
office
in
such
office
at
such
a
time
ready
decision
in
an
obscure
and
passing
situation
may
often
be
a
not
less
requisite
than
philosophic
grasp
either
of
the
popular
mind
or
of
eternal
laws
the
powers
which
he
had
hitherto
shown
would
still
be
needful
to
him
but
so
too
would
other
powers
which
he
had
never
practised
in
any
comparable
position
and
which
nature
does
not
in
a
moment
supply
any
attempt
to
judge
of
lincoln
presidency
and
it
can
only
be
judged
at
all
when
it
has
gone
on
some
way
must
take
account
not
perhaps
so
much
of
his
inexperience
as
of
his
own
reasonable
consciousness
of
it
and
his
great
anxiety
to
use
the
advice
of
men
who
were
in
any
way
presumably
more
competent
he
deliberately
delayed
his
arrival
in
washington
and
availed
himself
of
official
invitations
to
stay
at
four
great
towns
and
five
state
capitals
which
he
could
conveniently
pass
on
his
way
the
journey
abounded
in
small
incidents
and
speeches
some
of
which
exposed
him
to
a
little
ridicule
in
the
press
though
they
probably
created
an
undercurrent
of
sympathy
for
him
near
one
station
where
the
train
stopped
lived
a
little
girl
he
knew
who
had
recently
urged
upon
him
to
wear
a
beard
or
whiskers
to
this
dreadful
young
person
and
to
that
persistent
good
nature
of
his
which
was
now
and
then
fatuous
was
due
the
hairy
ornamentation
which
during
his
presidency
hid
the
really
beautiful
modelling
of
his
jaw
and
chin
he
enquired
for
her
at
the
station
had
her
fetched
from
the
crowd
claimed
her
praise
for
this
supposed
improvement
and
kissed
her
in
presence
of
the
press
in
new
york
he
was
guilty
of
a
more
sinister
and
tragic
misfeasance
in
that
city
where
if
it
may
be
said
with
respect
there
has
existed
from
of
old
a
fashionable
circle
not
convinced
of
its
own
gentility
and
insisting
the
more
rigorously
on
minor
decorum
lincoln
went
to
the
opera
and
history
still
deplores
that
this
misguided
man
went
there
and
sat
there
with
his
large
hands
in
black
kid
gloves
here
perhaps
it
is
well
to
say
that
the
educated
world
of
the
eastern
states
including
those
who
privately
deplored
lincoln
supposed
unfitness
treated
its
untried
chief
magistrate
with
that
engrained
good
breeding
to
which
it
was
utterly
indifferent
how
plain
a
man
he
might
be
his
lesser
speeches
as
he
went
were
unstudied
appeals
to
loyalty
with
very
simple
avowals
of
inadequacy
to
his
task
and
expressions
of
reliance
on
the
people
support
when
he
tried
to
do
his
duty
to
a
man
who
can
sometimes
speak
from
the
heart
and
to
the
heart
as
lincoln
did
it
is
perhaps
not
given
to
be
uniformly
felicitous
among
these
speeches
was
that
delivered
at
philadelphia
which
has
already
been
quoted
but
most
of
them
were
not
considered
felicitous
at
the
time
they
were
too
unpretentious
moreover
they
contained
sentences
which
seemed
to
understate
the
gravity
of
the
crisis
in
a
way
which
threw
doubt
on
his
own
serious
statesmanship
whether
they
were
felicitous
or
not
the
intention
of
these
utterances
was
the
best
proof
of
his
statesmanship
he
would
appeal
to
the
steady
loyalty
of
the
north
but
he
was
not
going
to
arouse
its
passion
he
assumed
to
the
last
that
calm
reflection
might
prevail
in
the
south
which
was
menaced
by
nothing
but
an
artificial
crisis
he
referred
to
war
as
a
possibility
but
left
no
doubt
of
his
own
wish
by
all
means
to
avoid
it
there
will
he
said
be
no
bloodshed
unless
it
be
forced
on
the
government
the
government
will
not
use
force
unless
force
is
used
against
it
before
he
passed
through
baltimore
he
received
earnest
communications
from
seward
and
from
general
scott
each
had
received
trustworthy
information
of
a
plot
which
existed
to
murder
him
in
that
city
owing
to
their
warnings
he
went
through
baltimore
secretly
at
night
so
that
his
arrival
in
washington
on
february
was
unexpected
this
was
his
obvious
duty
and
nobody
who
knew
him
was
ever
in
doubt
of
his
personal
intrepidity
but
of
course
it
helped
to
damp
the
effect
of
what
many
people
would
have
been
glad
to
regard
as
a
triumphal
progress
on
march
old
buchanan
came
in
his
carriage
to
escort
his
successor
to
the
inaugural
ceremony
where
it
was
the
ironical
fate
of
chief
justice
taney
to
administer
the
oath
to
a
president
who
had
already
gone
far
to
undo
his
great
work
yet
a
third
notable
democrat
was
there
to
do
a
pleasant
little
act
douglas
lincoln
defeated
rival
placed
himself
with
a
fine
ostentation
by
his
side
and
observing
that
he
was
embarrassed
as
to
where
to
put
his
new
tall
hat
and
preposterous
cane
took
charge
of
these
encumbrances
before
the
moment
arrived
for
the
most
eagerly
awaited
of
all
his
speeches
lincoln
had
submitted
his
draft
of
his
first
inaugural
to
seward
and
this
draft
with
seward
abundant
suggestions
of
amendment
has
been
preserved
it
has
considerable
literary
interest
and
by
the
readiness
with
which
most
of
seward
suggestions
were
adopted
and
the
decision
with
which
some
and
those
not
the
least
important
were
set
aside
by
lincoln
it
illustrates
well
the
working
relation
which
after
one
short
struggle
was
to
be
established
between
these
two
men
by
seward
advice
lincoln
added
to
an
otherwise
dry
speech
some
concluding
paragraphs
of
emotional
appeal
the
last
sentence
of
the
speech
which
alone
is
much
remembered
is
seward
in
the
first
conception
of
it
seward
in
the
slightly
hackneyed
phrase
with
which
it
ends
lincoln
alone
in
the
touch
of
haunting
beauty
which
is
on
it
his
first
inaugural
was
by
general
confession
an
able
state
paper
setting
forth
simply
and
well
a
situation
with
which
we
are
now
familiar
it
sets
out
dispassionately
the
state
of
the
controversy
on
slavery
lays
down
with
brief
argument
the
position
that
the
union
is
indissoluble
and
proceeds
to
define
the
duty
of
the
government
in
face
of
an
attempt
to
dissolve
it
the
power
he
said
confided
to
me
will
be
used
to
hold
occupy
and
possess
the
property
and
places
belonging
to
the
government
and
to
collect
the
duties
on
imports
but
beyond
what
may
be
necessary
for
these
objects
there
will
be
no
invasion
no
using
of
force
against
or
among
the
people
anywhere
the
mails
unless
repelled
will
continue
to
be
furnished
in
all
parts
of
the
union
he
proceeded
to
set
out
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
impossibility
of
real
separation
the
intimate
relations
between
the
peoples
of
the
several
states
must
still
continue
they
would
still
remain
for
adjustment
after
any
length
of
warfare
they
could
be
far
better
adjusted
in
union
than
in
enmity
he
concluded
in
your
hands
my
dissatisfied
and
not
in
mine
is
the
momentous
issue
of
civil
war
the
government
will
not
assail
you
you
can
have
no
conflict
without
being
yourselves
the
aggressors
i
am
loath
to
close
we
are
not
enemies
but
friends
we
must
not
be
enemies
though
passion
may
have
strained
it
must
not
break
our
bonds
of
affection
the
mystic
chords
of
memory
stretching
from
every
battlefield
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and
hearthstone
all
over
this
broad
land
will
yet
swell
the
chorus
of
the
union
when
again
touched
as
surely
they
will
be
by
the
better
angels
of
our
nature
outbreak
of
upon
the
president
there
now
descended
a
swarm
of
the
republican
party
had
never
been
in
power
before
and
these
patriotic
people
exceeded
in
number
and
voracity
those
that
had
assailed
any
american
president
before
to
be
accessible
to
all
such
was
the
normal
duty
of
a
president
it
was
perhaps
additionally
incumbent
on
him
at
this
time
when
in
the
course
of
nature
the
number
of
abated
they
were
succeeded
as
will
be
seen
by
supplicants
of
another
kind
whose
petitions
were
often
really
harrowing
the
horror
of
this
enduring
visitation
has
been
described
by
artemus
ward
in
terms
which
lincoln
himself
could
not
have
improved
upon
his
classical
treatment
of
the
subject
is
worth
serious
reference
for
it
should
be
realised
that
lincoln
who
had
both
to
learn
his
new
trade
of
statecraft
and
to
exercise
it
in
a
terrible
emergency
did
so
with
a
large
part
of
each
day
necessarily
consumed
by
worrying
and
distasteful
tasks
of
a
much
paltrier
kind
on
the
day
after
the
inauguration
came
word
from
major
anderson
at
fort
sumter
that
he
could
only
hold
out
a
few
weeks
longer
unless
reinforced
and
provisioned
with
it
came
to
lincoln
the
opinion
of
general
scott
that
to
relieve
fort
sumter
now
would
require
a
force
of
men
which
did
not
exist
the
cabinet
was
summoned
with
military
and
naval
advisers
the
sailors
thought
they
could
throw
men
and
provisions
into
fort
sumter
the
soldiers
said
the
ships
would
be
destroyed
by
the
confederate
batteries
lincoln
asked
his
cabinet
whether
assuming
it
to
be
feasible
it
was
politically
advisable
now
to
provision
fort
sumter
blair
said
yes
emphatically
chase
said
yes
in
a
qualified
way
the
other
five
members
of
the
cabinet
said
no
general
scott
had
given
his
opinion
as
on
a
military
question
that
the
fort
should
now
be
evacuated
they
argued
that
the
evacuation
of
this
one
fort
would
be
recognised
by
the
country
as
merely
a
military
necessity
arising
from
the
neglect
of
the
last
administration
lincoln
reserved
his
decision
let
us
conceive
the
effect
of
a
decision
to
evacuate
fort
sumter
south
carolina
had
for
long
claimed
it
as
a
due
acknowledgment
of
its
sovereign
and
independent
rights
and
for
no
other
end
the
confederacy
now
claimed
it
and
its
first
act
had
been
to
send
beauregard
to
threaten
the
fort
even
buchanan
had
ended
by
withstanding
these
claims
the
assertion
that
he
would
hold
these
forts
had
been
the
gist
of
lincoln
inaugural
this
was
the
one
fort
that
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
northern
public
or
the
southern
public
either
they
probably
never
realised
that
there
were
other
forts
fort
pickens
for
example
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
the
administration
was
prepared
to
defend
and
now
it
was
proposed
that
lincoln
who
had
put
down
his
foot
with
a
bang
yesterday
should
take
it
up
with
a
shuffle
and
lincoln
reserved
his
judgment
and
which
is
much
more
went
on
reserving
it
till
the
question
nearly
settled
itself
to
his
disgrace
lincoln
lacked
here
it
would
seem
not
by
any
means
the
qualities
of
the
trained
administrator
but
just
that
rough
perception
and
vigour
which
untaught
genius
might
be
supposed
to
possess
the
passionate
jackson
who
by
the
way
was
a
far
more
educated
man
in
the
respects
which
count
would
not
have
acted
so
lincoln
it
is
true
had
declared
that
he
would
take
no
provocative
step
in
your
hands
my
dissatisfied
and
not
in
mine
is
the
momentous
issue
of
civil
war
and
the
risk
which
he
would
have
taken
by
that
day
the
opinion
of
the
bulk
of
his
cabinet
based
on
that
of
his
chief
military
adviser
is
obvious
but
it
seems
to
have
been
a
lesser
risk
than
he
did
take
in
delaying
so
long
to
overrule
his
cabinet
it
is
precisely
characteristic
of
his
strength
and
of
his
weakness
that
he
did
not
at
once
yield
to
his
advisers
that
he
long
continued
weighing
the
matter
undisturbed
by
the
danger
of
delay
that
he
decided
as
soon
as
and
no
sooner
than
he
felt
sure
as
to
the
political
results
which
alone
here
mattered
for
the
military
consequences
amounted
to
nothing
this
story
was
entangled
from
the
first
with
another
difficult
story
commissioners
from
the
southern
confederacy
came
to
washington
and
sought
interviews
with
seward
they
came
to
treat
for
the
recognition
of
the
confederacy
and
the
peaceful
surrender
of
forts
and
the
like
within
its
borders
meanwhile
the
action
of
virginia
was
in
the
balance
and
the
peace
convention
summoned
by
virginia
still
threshing
again
as
lowell
said
the
already
straw
of
debate
the
action
of
virginia
and
of
other
border
states
about
which
lincoln
was
intensely
solicitous
would
certainly
depend
upon
the
action
of
the
government
towards
the
states
that
had
already
seceded
might
it
not
be
well
that
the
government
should
avoid
immediate
conflict
with
south
carolina
about
fort
sumter
though
conflict
with
the
confederacy
about
fort
pickens
and
the
rest
would
still
impend
was
it
not
possible
that
conflict
could
be
staved
off
till
an
agreement
could
be
reached
with
virginia
and
the
border
states
which
would
induce
the
seceded
states
to
return
these
questions
were
clearly
absurd
but
they
were
as
clearly
natural
and
they
greatly
exercised
seward
disappointed
at
not
being
president
and
equally
disturbed
at
the
prospect
of
civil
war
but
still
inclined
to
large
and
sanguine
hopes
he
was
rather
anxious
to
take
things
out
of
lincoln
hands
and
very
anxious
to
serve
his
country
as
the
great
peacemaker
indirect
negotiations
now
took
place
between
him
and
the
southern
commissioners
who
of
course
could
not
be
officially
recognised
through
the
medium
of
two
supreme
court
judges
especially
one
campbell
who
was
then
in
washington
seward
was
quite
loyal
to
lincoln
and
told
him
in
a
general
way
what
he
was
doing
he
was
also
candid
with
campbell
and
his
friends
and
explained
to
them
his
lack
of
authority
but
he
talked
freely
and
rashly
of
what
he
hoped
to
bring
about
lincoln
gave
seward
some
proper
cautions
and
left
him
all
proper
freedom
but
it
is
possible
that
he
once
told
douglas
that
he
intended
at
that
moment
to
evacuate
fort
sumter
the
upshot
of
the
matter
is
that
the
decision
of
the
government
was
delayed
by
negotiations
which
as
it
ought
to
have
known
could
come
to
nothing
and
that
the
southern
government
and
the
commissioners
after
they
had
got
home
thought
they
had
been
deceived
in
these
negotiations
discussions
were
still
proceeding
as
to
fort
sumter
when
a
fresh
difficulty
arose
for
lincoln
but
one
which
enabled
him
to
become
henceforth
master
in
his
cabinet
the
strain
of
seward
position
upon
a
man
inclined
to
be
vain
and
weak
can
easily
be
imagined
but
the
sudden
vagary
in
which
it
now
resulted
was
surprising
upon
april
he
sent
to
lincoln
some
thoughts
for
the
president
consideration
in
this
paper
after
deploring
what
he
described
as
the
lack
of
any
policy
so
far
and
defining
in
a
way
that
does
not
matter
his
attitude
as
to
the
forts
in
the
south
he
proceeded
thus
i
would
demand
explanations
from
great
britain
and
russia
and
send
agents
into
canada
mexico
and
central
america
to
raise
a
vigorous
spirit
of
independence
on
this
continent
against
european
intervention
and
if
satisfactory
explanations
are
not
received
from
spain
and
france
would
convene
congress
and
declare
war
against
them
in
other
words
seward
would
seek
to
end
all
domestic
dissensions
by
suddenly
creating
out
of
nothing
a
dazzling
foreign
policy
but
this
was
not
the
only
point
even
if
it
was
the
main
point
he
proceeded
either
the
president
must
do
it
that
is
the
sole
conduct
of
this
policy
himself
or
devolve
it
on
some
member
of
his
cabinet
it
is
not
my
especial
province
but
i
neither
seek
to
evade
nor
assume
responsibility
in
other
words
seward
put
himself
forward
as
the
sole
director
of
the
government
in
his
brief
reply
lincoln
made
no
reference
whatever
to
seward
amazing
programme
he
pointed
out
that
the
policy
so
far
as
to
which
seward
had
complained
was
one
in
which
seward
had
entirely
concurred
as
to
the
concluding
demand
that
some
one
man
and
that
man
seward
should
control
all
policy
he
wrote
if
this
must
be
done
i
must
do
it
when
a
general
line
of
policy
is
adopted
i
apprehend
there
is
no
danger
of
its
being
changed
without
good
reason
or
continuing
to
be
a
subject
of
unnecessary
debate
still
upon
points
arising
in
its
progress
i
wish
and
suppose
i
am
entitled
to
have
the
advice
of
all
the
cabinet
seward
was
not
a
fool
far
from
it
he
was
one
of
the
ablest
men
in
america
only
at
that
moment
strained
and
excited
beyond
the
limits
of
his
good
sense
lincoln
quiet
answer
sobered
him
then
and
for
ever
after
he
showed
a
generous
mind
he
wrote
to
his
wife
soon
after
executive
force
and
vigour
are
rare
qualities
the
president
is
the
best
of
us
and
lincoln
generosity
was
no
less
his
private
secretary
nicolay
saw
these
papers
but
no
other
man
knew
anything
of
seward
abortive
rebellion
against
lincoln
till
after
they
both
were
dead
the
story
needs
no
explanation
but
the
more
attentively
all
the
circumstances
are
considered
the
more
lincoln
handling
of
this
emergency
which
threatened
the
ruin
of
his
government
throws
into
shade
the
weakness
he
had
hitherto
shown
lincoln
was
thus
in
a
stronger
position
when
he
finally
decided
as
to
fort
sumter
it
is
unnecessary
to
follow
the
repeated
consultations
that
took
place
there
were
preparations
for
possible
expeditions
both
to
fort
sumter
and
to
fort
pickens
and
various
blunders
about
them
and
seward
made
some
trouble
by
officious
interference
about
them
an
announcement
was
sent
to
the
governor
of
south
carolina
that
provisions
would
be
sent
to
fort
sumter
and
he
was
assured
that
if
this
was
unopposed
no
further
steps
would
be
taken
what
chiefly
concerns
us
is
that
the
eventual
decision
to
send
provisions
but
not
troops
to
fort
sumter
was
lincoln
decision
but
that
it
was
not
taken
till
after
senators
and
congressmen
had
made
clear
to
him
that
northern
opinion
would
support
him
it
was
the
right
decision
for
it
conspicuously
avoided
the
appearance
of
provocation
while
it
upheld
the
right
of
the
union
but
it
was
taken
perilously
late
and
the
delay
exposed
the
government
to
the
risk
of
a
great
humiliation
an
alabama
gentleman
had
urged
jefferson
davis
that
the
impending
struggle
must
not
be
delayed
unless
he
said
you
sprinkle
blood
in
the
face
of
the
people
of
alabama
they
will
be
back
in
the
old
union
in
ten
days
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
the
statement
as
to
the
probable
collapse
of
the
south
was
mere
rhetoric
but
it
seems
that
his
advice
led
to
orders
being
sent
to
beauregard
to
reduce
fort
sumter
beauregard
sent
a
summons
to
anderson
anderson
now
all
but
starved
out
replied
that
unless
he
received
supplies
or
instructions
he
would
surrender
on
april
whether
by
beauregard
orders
or
through
some
misunderstanding
the
confederate
batteries
opened
fire
on
fort
sumter
on
april
fort
sumter
became
untenable
on
the
next
day
when
the
relief
ships
which
anderson
had
been
led
to
expect
sooner
but
which
could
in
no
case
really
have
helped
him
were
just
appearing
in
the
offing
anderson
very
properly
capitulated
on
sunday
april
he
marched
out
with
the
honours
of
war
the
union
flag
had
been
fired
upon
in
earnest
by
the
confederates
and
leaving
virginia
and
the
states
that
went
with
it
to
join
the
confederacy
if
they
chose
the
north
sprang
to
arms
in
the
events
which
had
led
up
to
the
outbreak
of
war
abraham
lincoln
had
played
a
part
more
admirable
and
more
decisive
in
its
effect
than
his
countrymen
could
have
noted
at
the
time
or
perhaps
have
appreciated
since
he
was
confronted
now
with
duties
requiring
mental
gifts
of
a
different
kind
from
those
which
he
had
hitherto
displayed
and
with
temptations
to
which
he
had
not
yet
been
exposed
in
a
general
sense
the
greatness
of
mind
and
heart
which
he
unfolded
under
fierce
trial
does
not
need
to
be
demonstrated
yet
in
detail
hardly
an
action
of
his

of

they

it

the

the
conditions
of
the
war
in
recounting
the
history
of
lincoln
presidency
it
will
be
necessary
to
mark
the
course
of
the
civil
war
stage
by
stage
as
we
proceed
there
are
however
one
or
two
general
features
of
the
contest
with
which
it
may
be
well
to
deal
by
way
of
preface
it
has
seldom
happened
that
a
people
entering
upon
a
great
war
have
understood
at
the
outset
what
the
character
of
that
war
would
be
when
the
american
civil
war
broke
out
the
north
expected
an
easy
victory
but
as
disappointment
came
soon
and
was
long
maintained
many
clever
people
adopted
the
opinion
which
early
prevailed
in
europe
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
success
at
all
at
the
first
the
difficulty
of
the
task
was
unrecognised
under
early
and
disappointment
the
strength
by
which
those
difficulties
could
be
overcome
began
to
be
despaired
of
without
reason
the
north
after
several
slave
states
which
were
at
first
doubtful
had
adhered
to
it
had
more
than
double
the
population
of
the
south
of
the
southern
population
a
very
large
part
were
slaves
who
though
industrially
useful
could
not
be
enlisted
in
material
resources
the
superiority
of
the
north
was
no
less
marked
and
its
material
wealth
grew
during
the
war
to
a
greater
extent
than
had
perhaps
ever
happened
to
any
other
belligerent
power
these
advantages
were
likely
to
be
decisive
in
the
end
if
the
north
could
and
would
endure
to
the
end
but
at
the
very
beginning
these
advantages
simply
did
not
tell
at
all
for
the
immediately
available
military
force
of
the
north
was
insignificant
and
that
of
the
south
clearly
superior
to
it
and
even
when
they
began
to
tell
it
was
bound
to
be
very
long
before
their
full
weight
could
be
brought
to
bear
and
the
object
which
was
to
be
obtained
was
supremely
difficult
of
attainment
it
was
not
a
defeat
of
the
south
which
might
result
in
the
alteration
of
a
frontier
the
cession
of
some
colonies
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
and
such
like
matters
it
was
a
conquest
of
the
south
so
complete
that
the
union
could
be
restored
on
a
firmer
basis
than
before
any
less
result
than
this
would
be
failure
in
the
war
and
the
country
to
be
thus
completely
conquered
by
an
unmilitary
people
of
nineteen
millions
was
of
enormous
extent
leaving
out
of
account
the
huge
outlying
state
of
texas
which
is
larger
than
germany
the
remaining
southern
states
which
joined
in
the
confederacy
have
an
area
somewhat
larger
than
that
of
germany
holland
and
belgium
put
together
and
this
great
region
had
no
industrial
centres
or
other
points
of
such
great
strategic
importance
that
by
the
occupation
of
them
the
remaining
area
could
be
dominated
the
feat
which
the
northern
people
eventually
achieved
has
been
said
by
the
english
historians
of
the
war
perhaps
with
some
exaggeration
to
have
been
a
greater
one
than
that
which
napoleon
attempted
to
his
own
undoing
when
he
invaded
russia
in
on
the
other
hand
the
south
was
in
some
respects
very
favourably
placed
for
resisting
invasion
from
the
north
the
southern
forces
during
most
of
the
war
were
in
the
language
of
military
writers
operating
on
interior
lines
that
is
the
different
portions
of
them
lay
nearer
to
one
another
than
did
the
different
portions
of
the
northern
forces
and
could
be
more
quickly
brought
to
converge
on
the
same
point
the
country
abounded
in
strong
positions
for
defence
which
could
be
held
by
a
relatively
small
force
while
in
every
invading
movement
the
invaders
had
to
advance
long
distances
from
the
base
thus
exposing
their
lines
of
communication
to
attack
the
advantage
of
this
situation
if
competent
use
were
made
of
it
was
bound
to
go
very
far
towards
compensating
for
inferiority
of
numbers
the
north
could
not
make
its
superior
numbers
on
land
tell
in
any
rapidly
decisive
fashion
without
exposing
itself
to
dangerous
in
naval
strength
its
superiority
was
asserted
almost
from
the
first
and
by
cutting
off
foreign
supplies
caused
the
southern
armies
to
suffer
severe
privations
before
the
war
was
half
through
but
its
full
effect
could
only
be
produced
very
slowly
thus
if
its
people
were
brave
and
its
leaders
capable
the
south
was
by
no
means
in
so
hopeless
a
case
as
might
at
first
have
appeared
with
good
fortune
it
might
hope
to
strike
its
powerful
antagonist
some
deadly
blow
before
that
antagonist
could
bring
its
strength
to
bear
and
even
if
this
hope
failed
a
sufficiently
tenacious
defence
might
well
wear
down
the
patience
of
the
north
as
soldiers
the
southerners
started
with
a
superiority
which
the
northerners
could
only
overtake
slowly
if
each
people
were
taken
in
the
mass
the
proportion
of
southerners
bred
to
an
outdoor
life
was
higher
generally
speaking
if
not
exactly
more
frugal
they
were
far
less
used
to
living
comfortably
above
all
all
classes
of
people
among
them
were
still
accustomed
to
think
of
fighting
as
a
normal
and
suitable
occupation
for
a
man
while
the
prevailing
temper
of
the
north
thought
of
man
as
meant
for
business
and
its
higher
temper
was
apt
to
think
of
fighting
as
odious
and
war
out
of
date
this
like
the
other
advantages
of
the
south
was
transitory
before
very
long
northerners
who
became
soldiers
at
a
sacrifice
of
inclination
from
the
highest
spirit
of
patriotism
or
in
the
methodic
temper
in
which
business
has
to
be
done
would
become
man
for
man
as
good
soldiers
as
the
southerners
but
the
original
superiority
of
the
southerners
would
continue
to
have
a
moral
effect
in
their
own
ranks
and
on
the
mind
of
the
enemy
more
especially
of
the
enemy
generals
even
after
its
cause
had
ceased
to
exist
and
herein
the
military
advantage
of
the
south
was
undoubtedly
through
the
first
half
of
the
war
considerable
in
the
matter
of
leadership
the
south
had
certain
very
real
and
certain
other
apparent
but
probably
delusive
advantages
the
united
states
had
no
large
number
of
trained
military
officers
still
capable
of
active
service
the
armies
of
the
north
and
south
alike
had
to
be
commanded
and
staffed
to
a
great
extent
by
men
who
first
studied
their
profession
in
that
war
and
the
lack
of
ripe
military
judgment
was
likely
to
be
felt
most
in
the
higher
commands
where
the
forces
to
be
employed
and
were
largest
the
south
secured
what
may
be
called
its
fair
proportion
of
the
comparatively
few
officers
but
it
was
of
tremendous
moment
that
among
the
officers
who
when
the
war
began
were
recognised
as
competent
two
who
sadly
but
in
simple
loyalty
to
the
state
of
virginia
took
the
southern
side
were
men
of
genius
the
advantages
of
the
south
would
have
been
no
advantages
without
skill
and
resolution
to
make
use
of
them
the
main
conditions
of
the
war
the
vast
space
the
difficulty
in
all
parts
of
it
of
moving
troops
the
generally
low
level
of
military
knowledge
were
all
such
as
greatly
enhance
the
opportunities
of
the
most
gifted
commander
lee
and
stonewall
jackson
thus
became
the
former
throughout
the
war
the
latter
till
he
was
killed
in
the
summer
of
factors
of
primary
importance
in
the
struggle
wolseley
who
had
besides
studying
their
record
conversed
both
with
lee
and
with
moltke
thought
lee
even
greater
than
moltke
and
the
military
writers
of
our
day
speak
of
him
as
one
of
the
great
commanders
of
history
as
to
jackson
lee
belief
in
him
is
sufficient
testimony
to
his
value
and
the
good
fortune
of
the
south
was
not
confined
to
these
two
signal
instances
most
of
the
southern
generals
who
appeared
early
in
the
war
could
be
retained
in
important
commands
to
the
end
the
south
might
have
seemed
at
first
equally
fortunate
in
the
character
of
the
administration
at
the
back
of
the
generals
an
ascendency
was
at
once
conceded
to
jefferson
davis
a
tried
political
leader
to
which
lincoln
had
to
win
his
way
and
the
past
experiences
of
the
two
men
had
been
very
different
the
operations
of
war
in
which
lincoln
had
taken
part
were
confined
according
to
his
own
romantic
account
in
a
speech
in
congress
to
stealing
ducks
and
onions
from
the
civil
population
his
ministers
were
as
ignorant
in
the
matter
as
he
their
military
adviser
scott
was
so
infirm
that
he
had
soon
to
retire
and
it
proved
most
difficult
to
replace
him
jefferson
davis
on
the
other
hand
started
with
knowledge
of
affairs
including
military
affairs
he
had
been
secretary
of
war
in
pierce
cabinet
and
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
war
since
then
above
all
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
had
commanded
a
regiment
with
some
distinction
in
the
mexican
war
it
is
thought
that
he
would
have
preferred
a
military
command
to
the
presidency
of
the
confederacy
and
as
his
own
experience
of
actual
war
was
as
great
as
that
of
his
generals
he
can
hardly
be
blamed
for
a
disposition
to
interfere
with
them
at
the
beginning
but
military
historians
while
criticising
perhaps
a
little
hastily
all
interventions
in
the
affairs
of
war
up
to
the
time
when
he
found
generals
whom
he
trusted
insist
that
davis
systematic
interference
was
far
more
harmful
to
his
cause
and
wolseley
who
watched
events
closely
from
canada
and
who
visited
the
southern
army
in
is
most
emphatic
in
this
opinion
he
interfered
with
lee
to
an
extent
which
nothing
but
lee
devoted
friendship
and
loyalty
could
have
made
tolerable
he
put
himself
into
relations
of
dire
hostility
with
joseph
johnston
and
in
suspended
him
in
the
most
injudicious
manner
above
all
when
the
military
position
of
the
south
had
begun
to
be
acutely
perilous
jefferson
davis
neither
devised
for
himself
nor
allowed
his
generals
to
devise
any
bold
policy
by
which
the
chance
that
still
remained
could
be
utilised
his
energy
of
will
showed
itself
in
the
end
in
nothing
but
a
resolution
to
protract
bloodshed
after
it
had
certainly
become
idle
if
we
turn
to
the
political
conditions
on
which
in
any
but
a
short
war
so
much
depends
the
south
will
appear
to
have
had
great
advantages
its
people
were
more
richly
endowed
than
the
mixed
and
crudely
democratic
multitude
of
the
north
in
the
traditional
aptitude
for
commanding
or
obeying
which
enables
people
to
pull
together
in
a
crisis
and
they
were
united
in
a
cause
such
as
would
secure
the
sustained
loyalty
of
any
ordinary
people
under
any
ordinary
leader
for
though
it
was
nothing
but
slavery
that
led
to
their
assertion
of
independence
from
the
moment
that
they
found
themselves
involved
in
war
they
were
fighting
for
a
freedom
to
which
they
felt
themselves
entitled
and
for
nothing
else
whatever
a
few
successful
encounters
at
the
start
tempted
the
ordinary
southerner
to
think
himself
a
better
man
than
the
ordinary
northerner
even
as
the
southern
congressmen
felt
themselves
superior
to
the
persons
whom
the
mistaken
democracy
of
the
north
too
frequently
elected
this
claim
of
independence
soon
acquired
something
of
the
fierce
pride
that
might
have
been
felt
by
an
ancient
nation
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
that
the
northern
people
as
a
whole
should
be
similarly
possessed
by
the
cause
in
which
they
fought
they
did
not
seem
to
be
fighting
for
their
own
liberty
and
they
would
have
hated
to
think
that
they
were
fighting
for
conquest
they
were
fighting
for
the
maintenance
of
a
national
unity
which
they
held
dear
the
question
how
far
it
was
worth
fighting
a
formidable
enemy
for
the
sake
of
eventual
unity
with
him
was
bound
to
present
itself
thus
far
from
wondering
that
the
cause
of
the
union
aroused
no
fuller
devotion
than
it
did
in
the
whole
lump
of
the
northern
people
we
may
wonder
that
it
inspired
with
so
lofty
a
patriotism
men
and
women
in
every
rank
of
life
who
were
able
to
leaven
that
lump
but
the
political
element
in
this
war
was
of
such
importance
as
to
lead
to
a
startling
result
the
north
came
nearest
to
yielding
at
a
time
when
in
a
military
sense
its
success
had
become
sure
to
preserve
a
united
north
was
the
greatest
and
one
of
the
hardest
of
the
duties
of
president
lincoln
to
a
civilian
reader
the
history
of
the
war
in
spite
of
the
picturesque
incidents
of
many
battles
may
easily
be
made
dreary
till
far
on
in
the
lengthy
process
of
subjecting
the
south
we
might
easily
become
immersed
in
some
futile
story
of
how
general
was
superseded
by
general
in
a
command
for
which
neither
discovered
any
purpose
but
that
of
not
with
general
z
and
this
impression
is
not
merely
due
to
our
failure
to
understand
the
difficulties
which
confronted
these
gallant
officers
the
dearth
of
trained
military
faculty
which
was
felt
at
the
outset
could
only
be
made
good
by
the
training
which
the
war
itself
supplied
such
commanders
as
grant
and
sherman
and
sheridan
not
only
could
not
have
been
recognised
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
they
were
not
then
the
soldiers
that
they
afterwards
became
and
the
want
was
necessarily
very
serious
in
the
case
of
the
higher
commands
which
required
the
movement
of
large
forces
the
control
of
subordinates
each
of
whom
must
have
a
wide
discretion
and
the
energy
of
intellect
and
will
necessary
for
resolving
the
more
complex
problems
of
strategy
we
are
called
upon
to
admire
upon
both
sides
the
devotion
of
forgotten
thousands
and
to
admire
upon
the
side
of
the
south
the
brilliant
and
daring
operations
by
which
in
so
many
battles
lee
and
jackson
defeated
superior
forces
on
the
northern
side
later
on
great
generals
came
to
view
but
it
is
in
the
main
a
different
sort
of
achievement
which
we
are
called
upon
to
appreciate
an
administration
appointed
to
direct
a
stupendous
operation
of
conquest
was
itself
of
necessity
ill
prepared
for
such
a
task
behind
it
were
a
legislature
and
a
public
opinion
equally
ill
prepared
to
support
and
to
assist
it
there
were
in
its
military
service
many
intelligent
and
many
enterprising
men
but
none
at
first
so
combining
intelligence
and
enterprise
that
he
could
grapple
with
any
great
responsibility
or
that
the
civil
power
would
have
been
warranted
in
reposing
complete
confidence
in
him
the
history
of
the
war
has
to
be
recounted
in
this
volume
chiefly
with
a
view
to
these
difficulties
of
the
administration
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
war
would
in
any
military
study
of
it
be
seen
to
be
the
character
of
the
troops
on
both
sides
on
both
sides
their
individual
quality
was
high
on
both
circumstances
and
the
disposition
of
the
people
combined
to
make
discipline
weak
this
character
common
to
the
two
armies
was
conspicuous
in
many
battles
of
the
war
but
a
larger
interest
attaches
to
the
policy
of
the
two
administrations
in
raising
and
organising
their
civilian
armies
the
southern
government
if
its
proceedings
were
studied
in
detail
would
probably
seem
to
have
been
better
advised
at
the
start
on
matters
of
military
organisation
for
instance
it
had
early
and
long
retained
a
superiority
in
cavalry
which
was
not
a
mere
result
of
good
fortune
but
here
too
there
was
an
inherent
advantage
in
the
very
fact
that
the
south
had
started
upon
a
desperate
venture
there
can
hardly
be
a
more
difficult
problem
of
detail
for
statesmen
than
the
of
military
and
civil
requirements
in
the
raising
of
an
army
but
in
the
south
all
civil
considerations
merged
themselves
in
the
paramount
necessity
of
a
military
success
for
which
all
knew
the
utmost
effort
was
needed
the
several
states
of
the
south
claiming
as
they
did
a
far
larger
independence
than
the
northern
states
knew
that
they
could
only
make
that
claim
good
by
being
efficient
members
of
the
confederacy
thus
it
was
comparatively
easy
for
the
confederate
government
to
adopt
and
maintain
a
consecutive
policy
in
this
matter
and
though
from
the
conditions
of
a
widely
spread
agricultural
population
voluntary
enlistment
produced
poor
results
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
it
appears
to
have
been
easy
to
introduce
quite
early
an
entirely
compulsory
system
of
a
stringent
kind
the
introduction
of
compulsory
service
in
the
north
has
its
place
in
our
subsequent
story
the
system
that
preceded
it
need
not
be
dwelt
upon
here
because
full
of
instruction
as
a
technical
study
of
it
such
as
has
been
made
by
colonel
henderson
must
be
no
brief
survey
by
an
amateur
could
be
useful
it
is
necessary
however
to
understand
the
position
in
which
lincoln
administration
was
placed
without
much
experience
in
america
or
perhaps
elsewhere
in
the
world
to
guide
it
it
must
not
be
contended
for
it
can
not
be
known
that
the
problem
was
fully
and
duly
envisaged
by
lincoln
on
his
cabinet
but
it
would
probably
in
any
case
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
pursue
from
the
first
a
consecutive
and
policy
for
raising
an
army
and
keeping
up
its
strength
the
position
of
the
north
differed
fundamentally
from
that
of
the
south
the
north
experienced
neither
the
ardour
nor
the
throes
of
a
revolution
it
was
never
in
any
fear
of
being
conquered
only
of
not
conquering
there
was
nothing
therefore
which
at
once
bestowed
on
the
government
a
moral
power
over
the
country
vastly
in
excess
of
that
which
it
exercised
in
normal
times
this
however
was
really
necessary
to
it
if
the
problem
of
the
army
was
to
be
handled
in
the
way
which
was
desirable
from
a
military
point
of
view
compulsory
service
could
not
at
first
be
thought
of
it
was
never
supposed
that
the
tiny
regular
army
of
the
united
states
government
could
be
raised
to
any
very
great
size
by
voluntary
enlistment
and
the
limited
increase
of
it
which
was
attempted
was
not
altogether
successful
the
existing
militia
system
of
the
several
states
was
almost
immediately
found
faulty
and
was
discarded
a
great
volunteer
force
had
to
be
raised
which
should
be
under
the
command
of
the
president
who
by
the
constitution
is
of
the
forces
of
the
union
but
which
must
be
raised
in
each
state
by
the
state
governor
or
if
he
was
utterly
wanting
by
leading
local
citizens
now
state
governors
are
not
it
must
be
recalled
officers
under
the
president
but
independent
potentates
acting
usually
in
as
much
detachment
from
him
as
the
of
oxford
or
cambridge
from
the
board
of
education
or
a
presbyterian
minister
from
a
bishop
this
group
of
men
for
the
most
part
able
patriotic
and
determined
were
there
to
be
used
and
had
to
be
consulted
it
follows
that
the
policy
of
the
north
in
raising
and
organising
its
armies
had
at
first
to
be
a
policy
evolved
between
numerous
independent
authorities
which
never
met
and
were
held
together
by
a
somewhat
ignorant
public
opinion
sometimes
much
depressed
and
sometimes
which
was
worse
oversanguine
it
is
impossible
to
judge
exactly
how
ill
or
how
well
lincoln
under
such
circumstances
grappled
with
this
particular
problem
but
many
anomalies
which
seem
to
us
preposterous
the
raising
of
raw
new
regiments
when
fine
seasoned
regiments
were
short
of
half
their
strength
and
so
forth
were
in
these
circumstances
inevitable
the
national
system
of
recruiting
backed
by
compulsion
which
was
later
set
up
still
required
for
its
success
the
of
state
and
local
authorities
of
this
wholly
independent
character
northern
and
southern
armies
alike
had
necessarily
to
be
commanded
to
a
great
extent
by
amateur
officers
the
number
of
officers
in
the
service
or
retired
who
had
been
trained
at
west
point
was
immeasurably
too
small
for
the
needs
of
the
armies
amateurs
had
to
be
called
in
and
not
only
so
but
they
had
in
some
cases
to
be
given
very
important
commands
the
not
altogether
unwholesome
tradition
that
a
man
can
turn
his
hand
to
anything
was
of
course
very
strong
in
america
and
the
short
military
annals
of
the
country
had
been
thought
to
have
added
some
illustrious
instances
to
the
roll
of
men
of
peace
who
have
distinguished
themselves
in
arms
so
a
political
leader
no
matter
whether
he
was
democrat
or
republican
who
was
a
man
of
known
general
capacity
would
sometimes
at
first
seem
suitable
for
an
important
command
rather
than
the
trained
but
unknown
professional
soldier
who
was
the
alternative
moreover
it
seemed
foolish
not
to
appoint
him
when
as
sometimes
happened
he
could
bring
thousands
of
recruits
from
his
state
the
civil
war
turned
out
however
to
show
the
superiority
of
the
duly
trained
military
mind
in
a
marked
degree
some
of
repute
of
course
proved
incapable
and
a
great
many
amateur
colonels
and
generals
both
north
and
south
attained
a
very
fair
level
of
competence
in
the
service
the
few
conspicuous
failures
seem
to
have
been
quite
exceptional
but
all
the
same
of
the
many
clever
and
stirring
men
who
then
took
up
soldiering
as
novices
and
served
for
four
years
not
one
achieved
brilliant
success
of
the
generals
in
the
war
whose
names
are
remembered
some
had
indeed
passed
years
in
civil
life
but
every
one
had
received
a
thorough
military
training
in
the
years
of
his
early
manhood
it
certainly
does
not
appear
that
the
administration
was
really
neglectful
of
professional
merit
it
hungered
to
find
it
but
many
appointments
must
at
first
have
been
made
in
a
haphazard
fashion
for
there
was
no
machinery
for
sifting
claims
a
zealous
but
unknown
put
under
an
outsider
would
be
apt
to
write
as
sherman
did
in
early
days
lincoln
meant
to
insult
me
and
the
army
and
a
considerable
jealousy
evidently
arose
between
and
amateurs
it
was
aggravated
by
the
rivalry
between
officers
of
the
eastern
army
and
those
of
the
more
largely
amateur
western
army
the
amateurs
too
had
something
to
say
on
their
side
they
were
apt
to
accuse
as
a
class
of
a
cringing
belief
that
the
south
was
invincible
there
was
nothing
unnatural
or
very
serious
in
all
this
but
political
influences
which
arose
later
caused
complaints
of
this
nature
to
be
made
the
most
of
and
a
general
charge
to
be
made
against
lincoln
administration
of
appointing
generals
and
removing
them
under
improper
political
influences
this
general
charge
however
rests
upon
a
limited
number
of
alleged
instances
and
all
of
these
which
are
of
any
importance
will
necessarily
be
examined
in
later
chapters
it
may
be
useful
to
a
reader
who
wishes
to
follow
the
main
course
of
the
war
carefully
if
the
chief
ways
in
which
geographical
facts
affected
it
are
here
summarised
necessarily
somewhat
dryly
minor
operations
at
outlying
points
on
the
coast
or
in
the
far
west
will
be
left
out
of
account
so
also
will
a
serious
political
consideration
which
we
shall
later
see
caused
doubt
for
a
time
as
to
the
proper
strategy
of
the
north
it
must
be
noted
first
startling
as
it
may
be
to
englishmen
who
remember
the
war
partly
by
the
exploits
of
the
that
the
naval
superiority
of
the
north
was
overwhelming
in
spite
of
many
gallant
efforts
by
the
southern
sailors
the
north
could
blockade
their
coasts
and
could
capture
most
of
the
southern
ports
long
before
its
superiority
on
land
was
established
turning
then
to
land
we
may
treat
the
political
frontier
between
the
two
powers
after
a
short
preliminary
stage
of
war
as
being
marked
by
the
southern
boundaries
of
maryland
west
virginia
kentucky
and
missouri
just
as
they
are
seen
on
the
map
in
doing
so
we
must
note
that
at
the
commencement
of
large
operations
parts
of
kentucky
and
missouri
were
occupied
by
southern
invading
forces
this
frontier
is
cut
not
far
from
the
atlantic
by
the
parallel
mountain
chains
which
make
up
the
alleghanies
or
appalachians
these
in
effect
separated
the
field
of
operations
into
a
narrow
eastern
theatre
of
war
and
an
almost
boundless
western
theatre
and
the
operations
in
these
two
theatres
were
almost
to
the
end
independent
of
each
other
in
the
eastern
theatre
of
war
lies
washington
the
capital
of
the
union
a
place
of
great
importance
to
the
north
for
obvious
reasons
and
especially
because
if
it
fell
european
powers
would
be
likely
to
recognise
the
confederacy
it
lies
on
the
potomac
right
upon
the
frontier
and
could
be
menaced
also
in
the
rear
for
the
broad
and
fertile
trough
between
the
mountain
chains
formed
by
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
river
which
flows
northward
to
join
the
potomac
at
a
point
of
washington
was
in
confederate
hands
and
formed
a
sort
of
by
which
a
force
from
richmond
could
get
almost
behind
washington
a
hundred
miles
south
of
washington
lay
richmond
which
shortly
became
the
capital
of
the
confederates
instead
of
montgomery
in
alabama
as
a
capital
it
mattered
little
to
the
confederates
though
at
the
very
end
of
the
war
it
became
their
last
remaining
stronghold
the
intervening
country
which
was
in
southern
hands
was
extraordinarily
difficult
the
reader
may
notice
on
the
map
the
rivers
with
broad
estuaries
which
are
its
most
marked
features
and
with
the
names
of
which
we
shall
become
familiar
the
rivers
themselves
were
obstacles
to
an
invading
northern
army
their
estuaries
on
the
other
hand
soon
afforded
it
safe
communication
by
sea
in
the
western
theatre
of
war
we
must
remember
first
the
enormous
length
of
frontier
in
proportion
to
the
population
on
either
side
this
necessarily
made
the
progress
of
northern
invasion
slow
and
its
proper
direction
hard
to
determine
for
diversions
could
be
created
by
a
elsewhere
along
the
frontier
or
a
stroke
at
the
invaders
communications
the
principal
feature
of
the
whole
region
is
the
great
waterways
on
which
the
same
advantages
which
gave
the
sea
to
the
north
gave
it
also
an
immense
superiority
in
the
river
warfare
of
flotillas
of
gunboats
when
the
north
with
its
gunboats
could
get
control
of
the
mississippi
the
south
would
be
deprived
of
a
considerable
part
of
its
territory
and
resources
and
cut
off
from
its
last
means
of
trading
with
europe
save
for
the
relief
afforded
by
by
being
cut
off
from
mexico
and
its
ports
further
when
the
north
could
control
the
tributaries
of
the
mississippi
especially
the
cumberland
and
the
tennessee
which
flow
into
the
great
river
through
the
ohio
it
would
cut
deep
into
the
internal
communications
of
the
south
against
this
menace
the
south
could
only
contend
by
erecting
powerful
fortresses
on
the
rivers
and
the
capture
of
some
of
them
was
the
great
object
of
the
earlier
northern
operations
the
railway
system
of
the
south
must
also
be
taken
into
account
in
connection
with
their
waterways
this
of
course
can
not
be
seen
on
a
modern
map
perhaps
the
following
may
make
the
main
points
clear
the
southern
railway
system
touched
the
mississippi
and
the
world
beyond
it
at
three
points
only
memphis
vicksburg
and
new
orleans
a
traveller
wishing
to
go
say
from
richmond
by
rail
towards
the
west
could
have
if
distance
were
indifferent
to
him
a
choice
of
three
routes
for
part
of
the
way
he
could
go
through
knoxville
in
tennessee
to
chattanooga
in
that
state
where
he
had
a
choice
of
routes
further
west
or
he
could
take
one
of
two
alternative
lines
south
into
georgia
and
thence
go
either
to
atlanta
or
to
columbus
in
the
west
of
that
state
arrived
at
atlanta
or
columbus
he
could
proceed
further
west
either
by
making
a
detour
northwards
through
chattanooga
or
by
making
a
detour
southwards
through
the
seaport
town
of
mobile
crossing
the
harbour
by
boat
thus
the
capture
of
chattanooga
from
the
south
would
go
far
towards
cutting
the
whole
southern
railway
system
in
two
and
the
capture
of
mobile
would
complete
it
lastly
we
may
notice
two
lines
running
north
and
south
through
the
state
of
mississippi
one
through
corinth
and
meridian
and
the
other
nearer
the
great
river
from
this
and
the
course
of
the
rivers
the
strategic
importance
of
some
of
the
towns
mentioned
may
be
partly
appreciated
the
subjugation
of
the
south
in
fact
began
by
a
process
necessarily
slow
and
much
interrupted
whereby
having
been
blockaded
by
sea
it
was
surrounded
by
land
cut
off
from
its
western
territory
and
deprived
of
its
main
internal
lines
of
communication
richmond
against
which
the
north
began
to
move
within
the
first
three
months
of
the
war
did
not
fall
till
nearly
four
years
later
when
the
process
just
described
had
been
completed
and
when
a
northern
army
had
triumphantly
progressed
wasting
the
resources
of
the
country
as
it
went
from
chattanooga
to
atlanta
thence
to
the
atlantic
coast
of
georgia
and
thence
northward
through
the
two
carolinas
till
it
was
about
to
join
hands
with
the
army
assailing
richmond
throughout
this
time
the
attention
of
a
large
part
of
the
northern
public
and
of
all
those
who
watched
the
war
from
europe
was
naturally
fastened
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
desperate
fighting
which
occurred
in
the
region
of
washington
and
of
richmond
and
upon
the
ill
success
of
the
north
in
endeavours
of
unforeseen
difficulty
against
the
latter
city
we
shall
see
however
that
the
long
and
humiliating
failure
of
the
north
in
this
quarter
was
neither
so
unaccountable
nor
nearly
so
important
as
it
appeared
chapter
viii
the
opening
of
the
war
and
lincoln
administration
on
the
morning
after
the
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
there
appeared
a
proclamation
by
the
president
calling
upon
the
militia
of
the
several
states
to
furnish
men
for
the
service
of
the
united
states
in
the
suppression
of
an
unlawful
combination
their
service
however
would
expire
by
law
thirty
days
after
the
next
meeting
of
congress
and
in
compliance
with
a
further
requirement
of
law
upon
this
subject
the
president
also
summoned
congress
to
meet
in
extraordinary
session
upon
july
the
army
already
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
consisted
of
but
officers
and
men
and
though
the
men
of
this
force
being
less
affected
by
state
ties
than
their
officers
remained
as
did
the
men
of
the
navy
true
almost
without
exception
to
their
allegiance
all
but
of
them
were
unavailable
and
scattered
in
small
frontier
forts
in
the
west
a
few
days
later
when
it
became
plain
that
the
struggle
might
long
outlast
the
three
months
of
the
militia
the
president
called
for
volunteers
to
enlist
for
three
service
and
perhaps
for
the
statements
are
conflicting
some
troops
of
one
kind
and
another
had
been
raised
by
june
the
affair
of
fort
sumter
and
the
president
proclamation
at
once
aroused
and
concentrated
the
whole
public
opinion
of
the
free
states
in
the
north
and
in
an
opposite
sense
of
the
states
which
had
already
seceded
the
border
slave
states
had
now
to
declare
for
the
one
side
or
for
the
other
virginia
as
a
whole
joined
the
southern
confederacy
forthwith
but
several
counties
in
the
mountainous
region
of
the
west
of
that
state
were
strongly
for
the
union
these
eventually
succeeded
with
the
support
of
northern
troops
in
separating
from
virginia
and
forming
the
new
state
of
west
virginia
tennessee
also
joined
the
south
though
in
eastern
tennessee
the
bulk
of
the
people
held
out
for
the
union
without
such
good
fortune
as
their
neighbours
in
west
virginia
arkansas
beyond
the
mississippi
followed
the
same
example
though
there
were
some
doubt
and
division
in
all
parts
of
that
state
in
delaware
where
the
slaves
were
very
few
the
governor
did
not
formally
comply
with
the
president
proclamation
but
the
people
as
a
whole
responded
to
it
the
attitude
of
maryland
which
almost
surrounds
washington
kept
the
government
at
the
capital
in
suspense
and
alarm
for
a
while
for
both
the
city
of
baltimore
and
the
existing
state
legislature
were
inclined
to
the
south
in
kentucky
and
missouri
the
state
authorities
were
also
for
the
south
and
it
was
only
after
a
struggle
and
in
missouri
much
actual
fighting
that
the
unionist
majority
of
the
people
in
each
state
had
its
way
the
secession
of
virginia
had
consequences
even
more
important
than
the
loss
to
the
union
of
a
powerful
state
general
robert
lee
a
virginian
then
in
washington
was
esteemed
by
general
scott
to
be
the
ablest
officer
in
the
service
lincoln
and
his
secretary
of
war
desired
to
confer
on
him
the
command
of
the
army
lee
decision
was
made
with
much
reluctance
and
it
seems
hesitation
he
was
not
only
opposed
to
the
policy
of
secession
but
denied
the
right
of
a
state
to
secede
yet
he
believed
that
his
absolute
allegiance
was
due
to
virginia
he
resigned
his
commission
in
the
united
states
army
went
to
richmond
and
in
accordance
with
what
wolseley
describes
as
the
prevailing
principle
that
had
influenced
most
of
the
soldiers
he
met
in
the
south
placed
his
sword
at
the
disposal
of
his
own
state
the
same
loyalty
to
virginia
governed
another
great
soldier
thomas
jackson
whose
historic
nickname
stonewall
fails
to
convey
the
dashing
celerity
of
his
movements
while
they
both
lived
these
two
men
were
to
be
linked
together
in
the
closest
comradeship
and
mutual
trust
they
sprang
from
different
social
conditions
and
were
of
contrasting
types
the
epithet
cavalier
has
been
fitly
enough
applied
to
lee
and
jackson
after
conversion
from
the
wild
courses
of
his
youth
was
an
austere
puritan
to
quote
again
from
a
soldier
memoirs
wolseley
calls
lee
one
of
the
few
men
who
ever
seriously
impressed
and
awed
me
with
their
natural
their
inherent
greatness
he
speaks
of
his
majesty
and
of
the
beauty
of
his
character
and
of
the
sweetness
of
his
smile
and
the
impressive
dignity
of
the
style
of
his
address
his
greatness
he
says
made
me
humble
there
was
nothing
he
tells
us
of
these
refined
characteristics
in
stonewall
jackson
a
man
with
huge
hands
and
feet
but
he
possessed
an
assured
the
outcome
of
his
sure
trust
in
god
how
simple
how
a
man
as
his
impressive
eyes
met
yours
unflinchingly
you
knew
that
his
was
an
honest
heart
to
this
he
adds
touches
less
to
be
expected
concerning
a
puritan
warrior
whose
puritanism
was
in
fact
inclined
to
ferocity
how
jackson
remarkable
eyes
lit
up
for
the
moment
with
a
look
of
real
enthusiasm
as
he
recalled
the
architectural
beauty
of
the
seven
lancet
windows
in
york
minster
how
intense
was
the
benignity
of
his
expression
and
how
in
him
it
seemed
that
great
strength
of
character
and
obstinate
determination
were
united
with
extreme
gentleness
of
disposition
and
with
absolute
tenderness
towards
all
about
him
men
such
as
these
brought
to
the
southern
cause
something
besides
their
military
capacity
but
as
to
the
greatness
of
that
capacity
applied
in
a
war
in
which
the
scope
was
so
great
for
individual
leaders
of
genius
there
is
no
question
a
civilian
reader
looking
in
the
history
of
war
chiefly
for
the
evidences
of
personal
quality
can
at
least
discern
in
these
two
famous
soldiers
the
moral
daring
which
in
doubtful
circumstances
never
flinches
from
the
responsibility
of
a
risk
and
in
both
their
cases
as
in
those
of
some
other
great
commanders
can
recognise
in
this
rare
and
precious
attribute
the
outcome
of
their
personal
piety
we
shall
henceforth
have
to
do
with
the
southern
confederacy
and
its
armies
not
in
their
inner
history
but
with
sole
regard
to
the
task
which
they
imposed
upon
lincoln
and
the
north
but
at
this
parting
of
the
ways
a
tribute
is
due
to
the
two
men
among
many
devoted
people
who
in
their
and
unreflecting
loyalty
to
their
cause
gave
to
it
a
lustre
in
which
so
far
as
they
can
be
judged
neither
its
statesmen
nor
its
spiritual
guides
had
a
share
there
were
virginian
officers
who
did
not
thus
go
with
their
state
of
these
were
scott
himself
and
thomas
and
farragut
the
great
sailor
was
from
tennessee
throughout
the
free
states
of
the
north
there
took
place
a
national
uprising
of
which
none
who
remember
it
have
spoken
without
feeling
anew
its
spontaneous
ardour
men
flung
off
with
delight
the
hesitancy
of
the
preceding
months
and
recruiting
went
on
with
speed
and
enthusiasm
party
divisions
for
the
moment
disappeared
old
buchanan
made
public
his
adhesion
to
the
government
douglas
called
upon
lincoln
to
ask
how
best
he
could
serve
the
public
cause
and
at
his
request
went
down
to
illinois
to
guide
opinion
and
advance
recruiting
there
so
employed
the
president
great
rival
shortly
after
fell
ill
and
died
leaving
the
leadership
of
the
democrats
to
be
filled
thereafter
by
more
scrupulous
but
less
patriotic
men
there
was
exultant
confidence
in
the
power
of
the
nation
to
put
down
rebellion
and
those
who
realised
the
peril
in
which
for
many
days
the
capital
and
the
administration
were
placed
were
only
the
more
indignantly
determined
perhaps
the
most
trustworthy
record
of
popular
emotions
is
to
be
found
in
popular
humorists
shortly
after
these
days
artemus
ward
the
author
who
almost
vied
with
shakespeare
in
lincoln
affections
relates
how
the
confiscation
of
his
show
in
the
south
led
him
to
have
an
interview
with
jefferson
davis
even
now
said
davis
in
this
pleasant
fiction
we
have
many
frens
in
the
north
davis
is
the
reply
there
your
grate
mistaik
many
of
us
was
your
sincere
frends
and
thought
certin
parties
amung
us
was
fussin
about
you
and
meddlin
with
your
consarns
intirely
too
much
but
davis
the
minit
you
fire
a
gun
at
the
piece
of
dry
goods
called
the
banner
the
north
gits
up
and
rises
en
massy
in
defence
of
that
banner
not
agin
you
as
individooals
not
agin
the
south
even
but
to
save
the
flag
we
should
indeed
be
weak
in
the
knees
unsound
in
the
heart
in
the
liver
and
soft
in
the
hed
if
we
stood
quietly
by
and
saw
this
glorus
govyment
smashed
to
pieces
either
by
a
furrin
or
a
intestine
foe
the
mother
hates
to
take
her
naughty
child
across
her
knee
but
she
knows
it
is
her
dooty
to
do
it
so
we
shall
hate
to
whip
the
naughty
south
but
we
must
do
it
if
you
do
make
back
tracks
at
onct
and
we
shall
wallup
you
out
of
your
boots
in
the
days
which
followed
when
this
prompt
chastisement
could
not
be
effected
and
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
south
would
do
most
of
the
whipping
the
discordant
elements
which
mingled
in
this
unanimity
soon
showed
themselves
the
minority
that
opposed
the
war
was
for
a
time
silent
and
insignificant
but
among
the
supporters
of
the
war
there
were
those
who
loved
the
union
and
the
constitution
and
who
partly
for
this
very
reason
had
hitherto
cultivated
the
sympathies
of
the
south
these
adherents
mainly
of
the
democratic
party
would
desire
that
civil
war
should
be
waged
with
the
least
possible
breach
of
the
constitution
and
be
concluded
with
the
least
possible
social
change
many
of
them
would
wish
to
fight
not
to
a
finish
but
to
a
compromise
on
the
other
hand
there
were
those
who
loved
liberty
and
hated
alike
the
slave
system
of
the
south
and
the
arrogance
which
it
had
engendered
these
the
people
distinguished
within
the
republican
party
as
radicals
would
pay
little
heed
to
constitutional
restraints
in
repelling
an
attack
on
the
constitution
and
they
would
wish
from
the
first
to
make
avowed
war
upon
that
which
caused
the
war
slavery
in
the
border
states
there
was
of
course
more
active
sympathy
with
the
south
and
in
conflict
with
this
the
radicalism
of
some
of
these
states
became
more
stalwart
and
intractable
to
such
causes
of
dissension
was
added
as
time
went
on
sheer
fatigue
of
the
war
and
strangely
enough
this
influence
was
as
powerful
with
a
few
radicals
as
it
was
with
the
ingrained
democratic
partisans
they
despaired
of
the
result
when
success
at
last
was
imminent
and
became
sick
of
bloodshed
when
it
passed
what
they
presumably
regarded
as
a
reasonable
amount
it
was
the
task
of
the
administration
not
only
to
conduct
the
war
but
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
north
in
spite
of
differences
and
its
resolution
in
spite
of
disappointments
lincoln
was
in
more
than
one
way
well
fitted
for
this
task
old
experience
in
illinois
and
kentucky
enabled
him
to
understand
very
different
points
of
view
in
regard
to
the
cause
of
the
south
the
new
question
that
was
now
to
arise
about
slavery
was
but
a
particular
form
of
the
larger
question
of
principle
to
which
he
had
long
thought
out
an
answer
as
firm
and
as
definite
as
it
was
moderate
and
in
a
sense
subtle
he
had
moreover
a
quality
of
heart
which
as
it
seemed
to
those
near
him
the
protraction
of
the
conflict
with
its
necessary
strain
upon
him
only
strengthened
in
him
a
tenacity
which
scarcely
could
falter
in
the
cause
which
he
judged
to
be
right
was
not
merely
pure
from
bitterness
towards
his
antagonists
it
was
actually
bound
up
with
a
kindliness
towards
them
whatever
rank
may
be
assigned
to
his
services
and
to
his
deserts
it
is
first
and
foremost
in
these
directions
though
not
in
these
directions
alone
that
the
reader
of
his
story
must
look
for
them
upon
attentive
study
he
will
probably
appear
as
the
embodiment
in
a
degree
and
manner
which
are
alike
rare
of
the
more
constant
and
the
higher
judgment
of
his
people
it
is
plainer
still
that
he
embodied
the
resolute
purpose
which
underlay
the
fluctuations
upon
the
surface
of
their
political
life
the
english
military
historians
wood
and
edmonds
in
their
retrospect
over
the
course
of
the
war
well
sum
up
its
dramatic
aspect
when
they
say
against
the
great
military
genius
of
certain
of
the
southern
leaders
fate
opposed
the
unbroken
resolution
and
passionate
devotion
to
the
union
which
he
worshipped
of
the
great
northern
president
as
long
as
he
lived
and
ruled
the
people
of
the
north
there
could
be
no
turning
back
there
are
plenty
of
indications
in
the
literature
of
the
time
that
lincoln
determination
soon
began
to
be
widely
felt
and
to
be
appreciated
by
common
people
literally
crowds
of
people
from
all
parts
of
the
north
saw
him
exchanged
a
sentence
or
two
and
carried
home
their
impressions
and
those
who
were
near
him
record
the
constant
fortitude
of
his
bearing
noting
as
marked
exceptions
the
unrestrained
words
of
impatience
and
despondency
which
did
on
rare
occasions
escape
him
in
a
negative
way
too
even
the
political
world
bore
its
testimony
to
this
his
administration
was
charged
with
almost
every
other
form
of
weakness
but
there
was
never
a
suspicion
that
he
would
give
in
nor
again
in
the
severest
criticisms
upon
him
by
knowledgeable
men
that
have
been
unearthed
and
collected
does
the
suggestion
of
petty
personal
aims
or
of
anything
but
unselfish
devotion
ever
find
a
place
the
belief
that
he
could
be
trusted
spread
itself
among
plain
people
and
given
this
belief
plain
people
liked
him
the
better
because
he
was
plain
but
if
at
the
distance
at
which
we
contemplate
him
and
at
which
from
the
moment
of
his
death
all
america
contemplated
him
certain
grand
traits
emerge
it
is
not
for
a
moment
to
be
supposed
that
in
his
life
he
stood
out
in
front
of
the
people
as
a
great
leader
or
indeed
as
a
leader
at
all
in
the
manner
say
of
chatham
or
even
of
palmerston
lincoln
came
to
washington
doubtless
with
some
deep
thoughts
which
other
men
had
not
thought
doubtless
also
with
some
important
knowledge
for
instance
of
the
border
states
which
many
statesmen
lacked
but
he
came
there
a
man
inexperienced
in
affairs
it
was
a
part
of
his
strength
that
he
knew
this
very
well
that
he
meant
to
learn
thought
he
could
learn
did
not
mean
to
be
hurried
where
he
had
not
the
knowledge
to
decide
entirely
appreciated
superior
knowledge
in
others
and
was
entirely
unawed
by
it
but
senators
and
representatives
in
congress
and
journalists
of
high
standing
as
a
rule
perceived
the
inexperience
and
not
the
strength
the
deliberation
with
which
he
acted
patiently
watching
events
saying
little
listening
to
all
sides
conversing
with
a
naïveté
which
was
genuine
but
not
quite
artless
seemingly
obdurate
to
the
pressure
of
wise
counsels
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
all
this
struck
many
anxious
observers
as
sheer
incompetence
and
when
there
was
just
and
natural
cause
for
their
anxiety
there
was
no
established
presumption
of
his
wisdom
to
set
against
it
and
this
effect
was
enhanced
by
what
may
be
called
his
plainness
his
awkwardness
and
actual
eccentricity
in
many
minor
matters
to
many
intelligent
people
who
met
him
they
were
a
grievous
and
though
some
most
cultivated
men
were
not
at
all
struck
by
them
and
were
pleased
instead
by
his
seeming
sincere
and
honest
and
steady
or
the
like
it
is
clear
that
no
one
in
washington
was
greatly
impressed
by
him
at
first
meeting
his
oddities
were
real
and
incorrigible
young
john
hay
whom
nicolay
his
private
secretary
introduced
as
his
assistant
a
humorist
like
lincoln
himself
but
with
leanings
to
literary
elegance
and
a
keen
eye
for
social
distinctions
loved
him
all
along
and
came
to
worship
him
but
irreverent
amusement
is
to
be
traced
in
his
recently
published
letters
and
the
glimpses
which
he
gives
us
of
the
ancient
or
the
tycoon
when
quite
at
home
and
quite
at
his
ease
fully
justify
him
lincoln
had
great
dignity
and
tact
for
use
when
he
wanted
them
but
he
did
not
always
see
the
use
of
them
senator
sherman
was
presented
to
the
new
president
so
you
john
sherman
said
lincoln
let
see
if
you
as
tall
as
i
am
we
measure
the
grave
politician
who
was
made
to
stand
back
to
back
with
him
before
the
company
till
this
interesting
question
was
settled
dimly
perceived
that
the
intention
was
friendly
but
felt
that
there
was
a
lack
of
ceremony
lincoln
height
was
one
of
his
subjects
of
harmless
vanity
many
tall
men
had
to
measure
themselves
against
him
in
this
manner
and
probably
felt
like
john
sherman
on
all
sorts
of
occasions
and
to
all
sorts
of
people
he
would
tell
a
little
story
which
was
often
enough
in
lord
lyons
phrase
an
extreme
story
this
was
the
way
in
which
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
be
friendly
in
company
it
served
a
purpose
when
intrusive
questions
had
to
be
evaded
or
reproofs
or
refusals
to
be
given
without
offence
as
his
laborious
and
sorrowful
task
came
to
weigh
heavier
upon
him
his
capacity
for
play
of
this
sort
became
a
great
resource
to
him
as
his
fame
became
established
people
recognised
him
as
a
humorist
the
inevitable
little
story
became
to
many
an
endearing
form
of
eccentricity
but
we
may
be
sure
it
was
not
so
always
or
to
everybody
those
says
carl
schurz
a
political
exile
from
prussia
who
did
good
service
military
and
political
to
the
northern
cause
those
who
visited
the
white
house
and
the
white
house
appeared
to
be
open
to
whosoever
wished
to
enter
saw
there
a
man
of
unconventional
manners
who
without
the
slightest
effort
to
put
on
dignity
treated
all
men
alike
much
like
old
neighbours
whose
speech
had
not
seldom
a
rustic
flavour
about
it
who
always
seemed
to
have
time
for
a
homely
talk
and
never
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
press
business
and
who
occasionally
spoke
about
important
affairs
of
state
with
the
same
nonchalance
i
might
almost
say
irreverence
with
which
he
might
have
discussed
an
law
case
in
his
office
at
springfield
illinois
thus
lincoln
was
very
far
from
inspiring
general
confidence
in
anything
beyond
his
good
intentions
he
is
remembered
as
a
personality
with
a
something
about
him
the
vague
phrase
is
john
bright
which
widely
endeared
him
but
his
was
by
no
means
that
magnetic
personality
which
we
might
be
led
to
believe
was
indispensable
in
america
indeed
it
is
remarkable
that
to
some
really
good
judges
he
remained
always
unimpressive
charles
francis
adams
who
during
the
civil
war
served
his
country
as
well
as
minister
in
london
as
his
grandfather
had
done
after
the
war
of
independence
lamented
to
the
end
that
seward
his
immediate
chief
had
to
serve
under
an
inferior
man
and
a
more
sympathetic
man
lord
lyons
our
representative
at
washington
refers
to
lincoln
with
nothing
more
than
an
amused
kindliness
no
detail
of
his
policy
has
escaped
fierce
criticism
and
the
man
himself
while
he
lived
was
the
subject
of
so
much
depreciation
and
condescending
approval
that
we
are
forced
to
ask
who
discovered
his
greatness
till
his
death
inclined
them
to
idealise
him
the
answer
is
that
precisely
those
americans
of
trained
intellect
whose
title
to
this
description
is
clearest
outside
america
were
the
first
who
began
to
see
beneath
his
strange
exterior
lowell
watching
the
course
of
public
events
with
ceaseless
scrutiny
walt
whitman
sauntering
in
washington
in
the
intervals
of
the
labour
among
the
wounded
by
which
he
broke
down
his
robust
strength
and
seeing
things
as
they
passed
with
the
sure
observation
of
a
poet
motley
the
historian
of
the
dutch
republic
studying
affairs
in
the
thick
of
them
at
the
outset
of
the
war
and
not
less
closely
by
correspondence
when
he
went
as
minister
to
vienna
such
men
when
they
praised
lincoln
after
his
death
expressed
a
judgment
which
they
began
to
form
from
the
first
a
judgment
which
started
with
the
recognition
of
his
honesty
traced
the
evidence
of
his
wisdom
as
it
appeared
gradually
and
not
by
repentant
impulse
learned
his
greatness
and
it
is
a
judgment
large
enough
to
explain
the
lower
estimate
of
lincoln
which
certainly
had
wide
currency
not
to
multiply
witnesses
motley
in
june
having
seen
him
for
the
second
time
writes
i
went
and
had
an
hour
talk
with
lincoln
i
am
very
glad
of
it
for
had
i
not
done
so
i
should
have
left
washington
with
a
very
inaccurate
impression
of
the
president
i
am
now
satisfied
that
he
is
a
man
of
very
considerable
native
sagacity
and
that
he
has
an
ingenuous
unsophisticated
frank
and
noble
character
i
believe
him
to
be
as
true
as
steel
and
as
courageous
as
true
at
the
same
time
there
is
doubtless
an
ignorance
about
state
matters
and
particularly
about
foreign
affairs
which
he
does
not
attempt
to
conceal
but
which
we
must
of
necessity
regret
in
a
man
placed
in
such
a
position
at
such
a
crisis
nevertheless
his
very
modesty
in
this
respect
disarms
criticism
we
parted
very
affectionately
and
perhaps
i
shall
never
set
eyes
on
him
again
but
i
feel
that
so
far
as
perfect
integrity
and
directness
of
purpose
go
the
country
will
be
safe
in
his
hands
three
years
had
passed
and
the
political
world
of
america
was
in
that
storm
of
general
dissatisfaction
in
which
not
a
member
of
congress
would
be
known
as
a
lincoln
man
when
motley
writes
again
from
vienna
to
his
mother
i
venerate
abraham
lincoln
exactly
because
he
is
the
true
honest
type
of
american
democracy
there
is
nothing
of
the
the
fine
gentleman
he
is
the
great
american
demos
honest
shrewd
homely
wise
humorous
cheerful
brave
blundering
occasionally
but
through
blunders
struggling
onwards
towards
what
he
believes
the
right
in
a
later
letter
he
observes
his
mental
abilities
were
large
and
they
became
the
more
robust
as
the
more
weight
was
imposed
upon
them
this
last
sentence
especially
if
in
lincoln
mental
abilities
the
qualities
of
his
character
be
included
probably
indicates
the
chief
point
for
remark
in
any
estimate
of
his
presidency
it
is
true
that
he
was
judged
at
first
as
a
stranger
among
strangers
walt
whitman
has
described
vividly
a
scene
with
a
dash
of
comedy
almost
farce
such
as
shakespeare
puts
in
his
blackest
tragedies
outside
the
hotel
in
new
york
where
lincoln
stayed
on
his
journey
to
washington
his
look
and
gait
his
perfect
composure
and
coolness
to
cut
it
short
the
usually
noted
marks
of
his
eccentricity
as
he
stood
looking
with
curiosity
on
that
immense
sea
of
faces
and
the
sea
of
faces
returned
the
look
with
similar
curiosity
not
a
single
one
among
the
crowd
his
personal
friend
he
was
not
much
otherwise
situated
when
he
came
to
washington
it
is
true
also
that
in
the
early
days
he
was
learning
his
business
why
president
said
some
one
towards
the
end
of
his
life
you
have
changed
your
mind
yes
i
have
said
he
and
i
do
think
much
of
a
man
who
is
wiser
than
he
was
yesterday
but
it
seems
to
be
above
all
true
that
the
exercise
of
power
and
the
endurance
of
responsibility
gave
him
new
strength
this
of
course
can
not
be
demonstrated
but
americans
then
living
who
recall
abraham
lincoln
remark
most
frequently
how
the
man
grew
to
his
task
and
this
perhaps
is
the
main
impression
which
the
slight
record
here
presented
will
convey
the
impression
of
a
man
quite
unlike
the
many
statesmen
whom
power
and
the
vexations
attendant
upon
it
have
in
some
piteous
way
spoiled
and
marred
a
man
who
started
by
being
tough
and
shrewd
and
canny
and
became
very
strong
and
very
wise
started
with
an
inclination
to
honesty
courage
and
kindness
and
became
under
a
tremendous
strain
honest
brave
and
kind
to
an
almost
tremendous
degree
the
north
then
started
upon
the
struggle
with
an
eagerness
and
unanimity
from
which
the
revulsion
was
to
try
all
hearts
and
the
president
most
of
all
and
not
a
man
in
the
north
guessed
what
the
strain
of
that
struggle
was
to
be
at
first
indeed
there
was
alarm
in
washington
for
the
immediate
safety
of
the
city
confederate
flags
could
be
seen
floating
from
the
hotels
in
alexandria
across
the
river
washington
itself
was
full
of
rumours
of
plots
and
intended
assassinations
and
full
of
actual
southern
spies
everything
was
disorganised
and
lincoln
himself
walking
round
one
night
found
the
arsenal
with
open
doors
absolutely
unguarded
by
april
first
the
navy
yard
at
gosport
in
virginia
had
to
be
abandoned
then
the
arsenal
at
harper
ferry
and
on
the
day
of
this
latter
event
lee
went
over
to
the
south
one
regiment
from
massachusetts
where
the
state
authorities
had
prepared
for
war
before
the
fall
of
sumter
was
already
in
washington
but
it
had
had
to
fight
its
way
through
a
furious
mob
in
baltimore
with
some
loss
of
life
on
both
sides
a
deputation
from
many
churches
in
that
city
came
to
the
president
begging
him
to
desist
from
his
bloodthirsty
preparations
but
found
him
constitutionally
genial
and
jovial
and
wholly
inaccessible
to
christian
appeals
it
mattered
more
that
a
majority
of
the
maryland
legislature
was
for
the
south
and
that
the
governor
temporised
and
requested
that
no
more
troops
should
pass
through
baltimore
the
mayor
of
baltimore
and
the
railway
authorities
burned
railway
bridges
and
tore
up
railway
lines
and
the
telegraph
wires
were
cut
thus
for
about
five
days
the
direct
route
to
washington
from
the
north
was
barred
it
seemed
as
if
the
boast
of
some
southern
orator
that
the
confederate
flag
would
float
over
the
capital
by
may
might
be
fulfilled
beauregard
could
have
transported
his
now
drilled
troops
by
rail
from
south
carolina
and
would
have
found
washington
isolated
and
hardly
garrisoned
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
such
daring
move
was
contemplated
in
the
south
and
the
citizens
of
richmond
virginia
were
themselves
under
a
similar
alarm
but
the
south
had
a
real
opportunity
the
fall
of
washington
at
that
moment
would
have
had
political
consequences
which
no
one
realised
better
than
lincoln
it
might
well
have
led
the
unionists
in
the
border
states
to
despair
and
there
is
evidence
that
even
then
he
so
fully
realised
the
task
which
lay
before
the
north
as
to
feel
that
the
loss
of
maryland
kentucky
and
missouri
would
have
made
it
impossible
he
was
at
heart
intensely
anxious
and
quaintly
and
injudiciously
relieved
his
feelings
by
the
remark
to
the
massachusetts
that
he
felt
as
if
all
other
help
were
a
dream
and
they
were
the
only
real
thing
yet
those
who
were
with
him
testify
to
his
composure
and
to
the
vigour
with
which
he
concerted
with
his
cabinet
the
various
measures
of
naval
military
financial
postal
and
police
preparation
which
the
occasion
required
but
which
need
not
here
be
detailed
many
of
the
measures
of
course
lay
outside
the
powers
which
congress
had
conferred
on
the
public
departments
but
the
president
had
no
hesitation
in
availing
himself
as
he
put
it
of
the
broader
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution
in
cases
of
insurrection
and
looking
for
the
sanction
of
congress
afterwards
rather
than
let
the
government
at
once
fall
into
ruin
the
difficulties
of
government
were
greatly
aggravated
by
the
uncertainty
as
to
which
of
its
servants
civil
naval
or
military
were
loyal
and
the
need
of
rapidly
filling
the
many
posts
left
vacant
by
unexpected
desertion
meanwhile
troops
from
new
england
and
also
from
new
york
which
had
utterly
disappointed
some
natural
expectations
in
the
south
by
the
enthusiasm
of
its
rally
to
the
union
quickly
arrived
near
baltimore
they
repaired
for
themselves
the
interrupted
railway
tracks
round
the
city
and
by
april
enough
soldiers
were
in
washington
to
put
an
end
to
any
present
alarm
in
case
of
need
the
law
of
habeas
corpus
was
suspended
in
maryland
the
president
had
no
wish
that
unnecessary
recourse
should
be
had
to
martial
law
naturally
however
one
of
his
generals
summarily
arrested
a
southern
recruiting
agent
in
baltimore
the
ordinary
law
would
probably
have
sufficed
and
lincoln
is
believed
to
have
regretted
this
action
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
must
support
it
when
done
hence
arose
an
occasion
for
the
old
chief
justice
taney
to
make
a
protest
on
behalf
of
legality
to
which
the
president
who
had
armed
force
on
his
side
could
not
give
way
and
thus
early
began
a
controversy
to
which
we
must
recur
it
was
gravely
urged
upon
lincoln
that
he
should
forcibly
prevent
the
legislature
of
maryland
from
holding
a
formal
sitting
he
refused
on
the
sensible
ground
that
the
legislators
could
assemble
in
some
way
and
had
better
not
assemble
with
a
real
grievance
in
constitutional
law
then
a
strange
alteration
came
over
baltimore
within
three
weeks
all
active
demonstration
in
favour
of
the
south
had
subsided
the
disaffected
legislature
resolved
upon
neutrality
the
governor
loyal
at
heart
if
the
brief
epithet
loyal
may
pass
as
not
begging
any
profound
legal
question
carried
on
affairs
in
the
interest
of
the
union
postal
communication
and
the
passage
of
troops
were
free
from
interruption
by
the
middle
of
may
and
the
pressing
alarm
about
maryland
was
over
these
incidents
of
the
first
days
of
war
have
been
recounted
in
some
detail
because
they
may
illustrate
the
gravity
of
the
issue
in
the
border
states
in
others
of
which
the
struggle
though
further
removed
from
observation
lasted
longer
and
because
too
it
is
well
to
realise
the
stress
of
agitation
under
which
the
government
had
to
make
preparation
for
a
larger
struggle
while
lincoln
whose
will
was
decisive
in
all
these
measures
carried
on
all
the
while
that
seemingly
unimportant
routine
of
a
president
life
which
is
in
the
quietest
times
exacting
the
alarm
in
washington
was
only
transitory
and
it
was
generally
supposed
in
the
north
that
insurrection
would
be
easily
put
down
some
even
specified
the
number
of
days
necessary
agreeably
fixing
upon
a
smaller
number
than
the
ninety
days
for
which
the
militia
were
called
out
secretary
seward
has
been
credited
with
language
of
this
kind
and
even
general
scott
whose
political
judgment
was
feeble
though
his
military
judgment
was
sound
seems
at
first
to
have
rejected
proposals
for
example
for
drilling
irregular
cavalry
made
in
the
expectation
of
a
war
of
some
length
there
is
evidence
that
neither
lincoln
nor
cameron
the
secretary
of
war
indulged
in
these
pleasant
fancies
irresistible
public
opinion
in
the
east
especially
demanded
to
see
prompt
activity
the
north
had
arisen
in
its
might
it
was
for
the
administration
to
put
forth
that
might
capture
richmond
to
which
the
confederate
government
had
moved
and
therewith
make
an
end
of
rebellion
the
truth
was
that
the
north
had
to
make
its
army
before
it
could
wisely
advance
into
the
assured
territory
of
the
south
the
situation
of
the
southern
government
in
this
respect
was
precisely
the
same
the
north
had
enough
to
do
meantime
in
making
sure
of
the
states
which
were
still
debatable
ground
such
forces
as
were
available
must
of
necessity
be
used
for
this
purpose
but
for
any
larger
operations
of
war
military
considerations
especially
on
the
side
which
had
the
larger
resources
at
its
back
were
in
favour
of
waiting
and
perfecting
the
instrument
which
was
to
be
used
but
in
the
course
of
july
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
and
of
congress
which
had
then
assembled
overcame
not
without
some
reason
the
more
cautious
military
view
and
on
the
of
that
month
the
north
received
its
first
great
lesson
in
adversity
at
the
battle
of
bull
run
before
recounting
this
disaster
we
may
proceed
with
the
story
of
the
struggle
in
the
border
states
at
an
early
date
the
rising
armies
of
the
north
had
been
organised
into
three
commands
called
the
department
of
the
potomac
on
the
front
between
washington
and
richmond
the
department
of
the
ohio
on
the
upper
watershed
of
the
river
of
that
name
and
the
department
of
the
west
of
necessity
the
generals
commanding
in
these
two
more
western
departments
exercised
a
larger
discretion
than
the
general
at
washington
the
department
of
the
ohio
was
under
general
mcclellan
before
the
war
a
captain
of
engineers
who
had
retired
from
active
service
and
had
been
engaged
as
a
railway
manager
in
which
capacity
he
has
already
been
noticed
but
who
had
earned
a
good
name
in
the
mexican
war
had
been
keen
enough
in
his
profession
to
visit
the
crimea
and
was
esteemed
by
general
scott
the
people
of
west
virginia
who
as
has
been
said
were
trying
to
organise
themselves
as
a
new
state
adhering
to
the
union
were
invaded
by
forces
despatched
by
the
governor
of
their
old
state
they
lay
mainly
west
of
the
mountains
and
help
could
reach
them
up
tributary
valleys
of
the
ohio
they
appealed
to
mcclellan
and
the
successes
quickly
won
by
forces
despatched
by
him
and
afterwards
under
his
direct
command
secured
west
virginia
and
incidentally
the
reputation
of
mcclellan
in
kentucky
further
west
the
governor
endeavoured
to
hold
the
field
for
the
south
with
a
body
known
as
the
state
guard
while
unionist
leaders
among
the
people
were
raising
volunteer
regiments
for
the
north
nothing
however
was
determined
by
fighting
between
these
forces
the
state
legislature
at
first
took
up
an
attitude
of
neutrality
but
a
new
legislature
elected
in
june
was
overwhelmingly
for
the
union
ultimately
the
confederate
armies
invaded
kentucky
and
the
legislature
thereupon
invited
the
union
armies
into
the
state
to
expel
them
and
placed
kentucky
volunteers
at
the
disposal
of
the
president
thenceforward
though
kentucky
stretching
as
it
does
for
four
hundred
miles
between
the
mississippi
and
the
alleghanies
remained
for
long
a
the
allegiance
of
its
people
to
the
union
was
unshaken
but
the
uncertainty
about
their
attitude
continued
till
the
autumn
of
and
while
it
lasted
was
an
important
element
in
lincoln
calculations
it
must
be
remembered
that
slavery
existed
in
kentucky
maryland
and
missouri
in
missouri
the
strife
of
factions
was
fierce
already
in
january
there
had
been
reports
of
a
conspiracy
to
seize
the
arsenal
at
louis
for
the
south
when
the
time
came
and
general
scott
had
placed
in
command
captain
nathaniel
lyon
on
whose
loyalty
he
relied
the
more
because
he
was
an
opponent
of
slavery
the
governor
was
in
favour
of
the
south
as
was
also
the
legislature
and
the
governor
could
count
on
some
part
of
the
state
militia
so
lincoln
when
he
called
for
volunteers
commissioned
lyon
to
raise
them
in
missouri
in
this
task
a
union
state
committee
in
louis
greatly
helped
him
and
the
large
german
population
in
that
city
was
especially
ready
to
enlist
for
the
union
many
of
the
german
immigrants
of
those
days
had
come
to
america
partly
for
the
sake
of
its
free
institutions
a
state
convention
was
summoned
by
the
governor
to
pass
an
ordinance
of
secession
but
its
electors
were
minded
otherwise
and
the
convention
voted
against
secession
in
several
encounters
lyon
who
was
an
intrepid
soldier
defeated
the
forces
of
the
governor
in
june
he
took
possession
of
the
state
capital
driving
the
governor
and
legislature
away
the
state
convention
then
again
assembled
and
set
up
a
unionist
government
for
the
state
this
new
state
government
was
not
everywhere
acknowledged
conspiracies
in
the
southern
interest
continued
to
exist
in
missouri
and
the
state
was
repeatedly
molested
by
invasions
of
no
great
military
consequence
from
arkansas
indeed
in
the
autumn
there
was
a
serious
recrudescence
of
trouble
in
which
lyon
lost
his
life
but
substantially
missouri
was
secured
for
the
union
naturally
enough
a
great
many
of
the
citizens
of
missouri
who
had
combined
to
save
their
state
to
the
union
became
among
the
strongest
of
the
radicals
who
will
later
engage
our
attention
many
however
of
the
leading
men
who
had
done
most
in
this
cause
including
the
friends
of
blair
lincoln
adhered
no
less
emphatically
to
the
conservative
section
of
the
republicans
thus
in
the
autumn
of
north
and
south
had
become
solidified
into
something
like
two
countries
in
the
month
of
july
which
now
concerns
us
this
process
was
well
on
its
way
but
it
is
to
be
marked
that
the
whole
long
tract
of
kentucky
still
formed
a
neutral
zone
which
the
northern
government
did
not
wish
to
harass
and
which
perhaps
the
south
would
have
done
well
to
let
alone
while
further
west
in
missouri
the
forces
of
the
north
were
not
even
as
fully
organised
as
in
the
east
so
the
only
possible
direction
in
which
any
great
blow
could
be
struck
was
the
direction
of
richmond
now
the
capital
and
it
might
seem
therefore
the
heart
of
the
confederacy
the
confederate
congress
was
to
meet
there
on
july
the
york
which
was
edited
by
horace
greeley
a
vigorous
writer
whose
omniscience
was
unabated
by
the
variation
of
his
own
opinion
was
the
one
journal
of
influence
in
the
north
and
it
only
gave
exaggerated
point
to
a
general
feeling
when
it
declared
that
the
confederate
congress
must
not
meet
the
senators
and
congressmen
now
in
washington
were
not
quite
so
exacting
but
they
had
come
there
unanimous
in
their
readiness
to
vote
taxes
and
support
the
war
in
every
way
and
they
wanted
to
see
something
done
and
they
wanted
it
all
the
more
because
the
three
months
service
of
the
militia
was
running
out
general
scott
still
the
chief
military
adviser
of
government
was
quite
distinct
in
his
preference
for
waiting
and
for
perfecting
the
discipline
and
organisation
of
the
volunteers
who
had
not
yet
even
been
formed
into
brigades
on
the
militia
he
set
no
value
at
all
for
long
he
refused
to
countenance
any
but
minor
movements
preparatory
to
a
later
advance
it
is
not
quite
certain
however
that
congress
and
public
opinion
were
wrong
in
clamouring
for
action
the
southern
troops
were
not
much
if
at
all
more
ready
for
use
than
the
northerners
and
jefferson
davis
and
his
military
adviser
lee
desired
time
for
their
defensive
preparations
it
was
perhaps
too
much
to
expect
that
the
country
after
its
great
uprising
should
be
content
to
give
supplies
and
men
without
end
while
nothing
apparently
happened
and
the
spirit
of
the
troops
themselves
might
suffer
more
from
inaction
than
from
defeat
a
further
thought
while
it
made
defeat
seem
more
dangerous
made
battle
more
tempting
there
was
fear
that
european
powers
might
recognise
the
southern
confederacy
and
enter
into
relations
with
it
whether
they
did
so
depended
on
whether
they
were
confirmed
in
their
growing
suspicion
that
the
north
could
not
conquer
the
south
balancing
the
military
advice
which
was
given
them
as
to
the
risk
against
this
political
importunity
lincoln
and
his
cabinet
chose
the
risk
and
scott
at
length
withdrew
his
opposition
lincoln
was
possibly
more
sensitive
to
pressure
than
he
afterwards
became
more
prone
to
treat
himself
as
a
person
under
the
orders
of
the
people
but
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
acted
on
his
own
sober
judgment
as
well
as
that
of
his
cabinet
whatever
degree
of
confidence
he
reposed
in
scott
scott
was
not
very
insistent
the
risk
was
not
overwhelming
the
battle
was
very
nearly
won
would
have
been
won
if
the
orders
of
scott
had
been
carried
out
no
very
great
harm
in
fact
followed
the
defeat
of
bull
run
and
the
danger
of
inaction
was
real
he
was
probably
then
as
he
certainly
was
afterwards
profoundly
afraid
that
the
excessive
military
caution
which
he
often
encountered
would
destroy
the
cause
of
the
north
by
disheartening
the
people
who
supported
the
war
that
is
no
doubt
a
kind
of
fear
to
which
many
statesmen
are
too
prone
but
lincoln
sense
of
real
popular
feeling
throughout
the
wide
extent
of
the
north
is
agreed
to
have
been
uncommonly
sure
definite
judgment
on
such
a
question
is
impossible
but
probably
lincoln
and
his
cabinet
were
wise
however
they
did
not
win
their
battle
the
southern
army
under
beauregard
lay
near
the
bull
run
river
some
twenty
miles
from
washington
covering
the
railway
junction
of
manassas
on
the
line
to
richmond
the
main
northern
army
under
general
mcdowell
a
capable
officer
lay
south
of
the
potomac
where
fortifications
to
guard
washington
had
already
been
erected
on
virginian
soil
in
the
shenandoah
valley
was
another
southern
force
under
joseph
johnston
watched
by
the
northern
general
patterson
at
harper
ferry
which
had
been
recovered
by
scott
operations
each
of
these
northern
generals
was
in
superior
force
to
his
opponent
mcdowell
was
to
attack
the
confederate
position
at
manassas
while
patterson
whose
numbers
were
nearly
double
johnston
was
to
keep
him
so
seriously
occupied
that
he
could
not
join
beauregard
with
whatever
excuse
of
misunderstanding
or
the
like
patterson
made
hardly
an
attempt
to
carry
out
his
part
of
scott
orders
and
johnston
with
the
bulk
of
his
force
succeeded
in
joining
beauregard
the
day
before
mcdowell
attack
and
without
his
gaining
knowledge
of
this
movement
the
battle
of
bull
run
or
manassas
or
rather
the
earlier
and
more
famous
of
two
battles
so
named
was
an
engagement
of
untrained
troops
in
which
up
to
a
certain
point
the
high
individual
quality
of
those
troops
supplied
the
place
of
discipline
mcdowell
handled
with
good
judgment
a
very
unhandy
instrument
it
was
only
since
his
advance
had
been
contemplated
that
his
army
had
been
organised
in
brigades
the
enemy
occupying
high
wooded
banks
on
the
south
side
of
the
bull
run
a
stream
about
as
broad
as
the
thames
at
oxford
but
fordable
was
successfully
pushed
back
to
a
high
ridge
beyond
but
the
stubborn
attacks
over
difficult
ground
upon
this
further
position
failed
from
lack
of
and
when
it
already
seemed
doubtful
whether
the
tired
soldiers
of
the
north
could
renew
them
with
any
hope
they
were
themselves
attacked
on
their
right
flank
it
seems
that
from
that
moment
their
success
upon
that
day
was
really
hopeless
but
some
declare
that
the
northern
soldiers
with
one
accord
became
possessed
of
a
belief
that
this
flank
attack
by
a
comparatively
small
body
was
that
of
the
whole
force
of
johnston
freshly
arrived
upon
the
scene
in
any
case
they
spontaneously
retired
in
disorder
they
were
not
effectively
pursued
but
mcdowell
was
unable
to
rally
them
at
centreville
a
mile
or
so
behind
the
bull
run
among
the
camp
followers
the
panic
became
extreme
and
they
pressed
into
washington
in
wild
alarm
accompanied
by
citizens
and
congressmen
who
had
come
out
to
see
a
victory
and
who
left
one
or
two
of
their
number
behind
as
prisoners
of
war
the
result
was
a
surprise
to
the
southern
army
johnston
who
now
took
over
the
command
declared
that
it
was
as
much
disorganised
by
victory
as
the
northern
army
by
defeat
with
the
full
approval
of
his
superiors
in
richmond
he
devoted
himself
to
entrenching
his
position
at
manassas
but
in
washington
where
rumours
of
victory
had
been
arriving
all
through
the
day
of
battle
there
prevailed
for
some
time
an
impression
that
the
city
was
exposed
to
immediate
capture
and
this
impression
was
shared
by
mcclellan
to
whom
universal
opinion
now
turned
as
the
appointed
saviour
and
who
was
forthwith
summoned
to
washington
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
within
the
circle
of
the
administration
there
was
of
course
deep
mortification
old
general
scott
passionately
declared
himself
to
have
been
the
greatest
coward
in
america
in
having
ever
given
way
to
the
president
desire
for
action
lincoln
who
was
often
to
prove
his
readiness
to
take
blame
on
his
own
shoulders
evidently
thought
that
the
responsibility
in
this
case
was
shared
by
scott
and
demanded
to
know
whether
scott
accused
him
of
having
overborne
his
judgment
the
old
general
warmly
if
a
little
ambiguously
replied
that
he
had
served
under
many
presidents
but
never
known
a
kinder
master
plainly
he
felt
that
his
better
judgment
had
somehow
been
overpowered
and
yet
that
there
was
nothing
in
their
relations
for
which
in
his
heart
he
could
blame
the
president
and
this
trivial
dialogue
is
worth
remembering
during
the
dreary
and
controversial
tale
of
relations
with
scott
successor
lincoln
however
bitterly
disappointed
showed
no
signs
of
discomposure
or
hesitancy
the
business
of
making
the
army
of
the
potomac
quietly
began
over
again
to
the
four
days
after
bull
run
belongs
one
of
the
few
records
of
the
visits
to
the
troops
which
lincoln
constantly
paid
when
they
were
not
too
far
from
washington
cheering
them
with
little
talks
which
served
a
good
purpose
without
being
notable
he
was
reviewing
the
brigade
commanded
at
bull
run
by
william
sherman
later
but
not
yet
one
of
the
great
figures
in
the
war
he
was
open
to
all
complaints
and
a
colonel
of
militia
came
to
him
with
a
grievance
he
claimed
that
his
term
of
service
had
already
expired
that
he
had
intended
to
go
home
but
that
sherman
unlawfully
threatened
to
shoot
him
if
he
did
so
lincoln
had
a
good
look
at
sherman
and
then
advised
the
colonel
to
keep
out
of
sherman
way
as
he
looked
like
a
man
of
his
word
this
was
said
in
the
hearing
of
many
men
and
sherman
records
his
lively
gratitude
for
a
simple
jest
which
helped
him
greatly
in
keeping
his
brigade
in
existence
not
one
of
the
much
more
serious
defeats
suffered
later
in
the
war
produced
by
itself
so
lively
a
sense
of
discomfiture
in
the
north
as
this
thus
none
will
equally
claim
our
attention
but
except
for
the
first
false
alarms
in
washington
there
was
no
disposition
to
mistake
its
military
significance
the
second
uprising
of
the
north
which
followed
upon
this
bracing
shock
left
as
vivid
a
memory
as
the
little
disaster
of
bull
run
but
there
was
of
necessity
a
long
pause
while
mcclellan
remodelled
the
army
in
the
east
and
the
situation
in
the
west
was
becoming
ripe
for
important
movements
the
eagerness
of
the
northern
people
to
make
some
progress
again
asserted
itself
before
long
but
to
their
surprise
and
perhaps
to
that
of
a
reader
the
last
five
months
of
passed
without
notable
military
events
here
then
we
may
turn
to
the
progress
of
other
affairs
departmental
affairs
foreign
affairs
and
domestic
policy
which
it
must
not
be
forgotten
had
pressed
heavily
upon
the
administration
from
the
moment
that
war
began
administration
long
before
the
eastern
public
was
very
keenly
aware
of
lincoln
the
members
of
his
cabinet
had
come
to
think
of
the
administration
as
his
administration
some
like
seward
of
whom
it
could
have
been
little
expected
with
a
loyal
and
for
america
most
fortunate
acceptance
of
real
subordination
and
one
at
least
chase
with
indignant
surprise
that
his
own
really
great
abilities
were
not
dominant
one
minister
early
told
his
friends
that
there
was
but
one
vote
in
the
cabinet
the
president
this
must
not
be
taken
in
the
sense
that
personal
guidance
was
present
in
every
department
he
had
his
own
department
concerned
with
the
maintenance
of
northern
unity
and
with
that
great
underlying
problem
of
internal
policy
which
will
before
long
appear
again
and
the
business
of
the
war
department
was
so
immediately
vital
as
to
require
his
ceaseless
attention
but
in
other
matters
the
degree
and
manner
of
his
control
of
course
varied
again
it
is
far
from
being
the
case
that
the
cabinet
had
little
influence
on
his
action
he
not
only
consulted
it
much
but
deferred
to
it
much
his
wisdom
seems
to
have
shown
itself
in
nothing
more
strongly
than
in
recognising
when
he
wanted
advice
and
when
he
did
not
when
he
needed
support
and
when
he
could
stand
alone
sometimes
he
yielded
to
his
ministers
because
he
valued
their
judgment
sometimes
also
because
he
gauged
by
them
the
public
support
without
which
his
action
must
fail
sometimes
when
he
was
sure
of
the
necessity
he
took
grave
steps
without
advice
from
them
or
any
one
more
often
he
tried
to
arrive
with
them
at
a
real
community
of
decision
it
is
often
impossible
to
guess
what
acts
of
an
administration
are
rightly
credited
to
its
chief
the
hidden
merit
or
demerit
of
many
statesmen
has
constantly
lain
in
the
power
or
the
lack
of
it
of
guiding
their
colleagues
and
being
guided
in
turn
if
we
tried
to
be
exact
in
saying
lincoln
or
lincoln
cabinet
or
the
north
did
this
or
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
thresh
out
many
bushels
of
the
broad
impression
however
remains
that
in
the
many
things
in
which
lincoln
did
not
directly
rule
he
ruled
through
a
group
of
capable
men
of
whom
he
made
the
best
use
and
whom
no
other
chief
could
have
induced
to
serve
so
long
in
concord
as
we
proceed
some
authentic
examples
of
his
precise
relations
with
them
will
appear
in
which
unimportant
as
they
seem
one
test
of
his
quality
as
a
statesman
and
of
his
character
should
be
sought
the
naval
operations
of
the
war
afford
many
tales
of
daring
on
both
sides
which
can
not
here
be
noticed
they
afford
incidents
of
strange
interest
now
such
as
the
exploit
of
the
first
submarine
it
belonged
to
the
south
its
submersion
invariably
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
whole
crew
and
with
full
knowledge
of
this
a
devoted
crew
went
down
and
destroyed
a
valuable
northern
the
ravages
on
commerce
of
the
and
some
other
southern
cruisers
became
only
too
famous
in
england
from
whose
yards
they
had
escaped
the
north
failed
too
in
some
out
of
the
fairly
numerous
combined
naval
and
military
expeditions
which
were
undertaken
with
a
view
to
making
the
blockade
more
complete
and
less
arduous
by
the
occupation
of
southern
ports
and
perhaps
to
more
serious
incursions
into
the
south
among
those
of
them
which
will
require
no
special
notice
most
succeeded
thus
by
the
spring
of
florida
was
substantially
in
northern
hands
and
by
the
south
had
but
two
ports
left
charleston
and
wilmington
but
the
venture
most
attractive
to
northern
sentiment
an
attack
upon
charleston
itself
proved
a
mere
waste
of
military
force
moreover
till
a
strong
military
adviser
was
at
last
found
in
grant
there
was
some
dissipation
of
military
force
in
such
expeditions
nevertheless
the
naval
success
of
the
north
was
so
continuous
and
overwhelming
that
its
history
in
detail
need
not
be
recounted
in
these
pages
almost
from
the
first
the
grip
of
the
blockade
upon
the
southern
coasts
made
its
power
felt
and
early
in
the
inland
waterways
of
the
south
were
beginning
to
fall
under
the
command
of
the
northern
flotillas
such
a
success
needed
of
course
the
adoption
of
a
decided
policy
from
the
outset
it
needed
great
administrative
ability
to
improvise
a
navy
where
hardly
any
existed
and
where
the
conditions
of
its
employment
were
in
many
respects
novel
and
it
needed
resourceful
watching
to
meet
the
surprises
of
fresh
naval
invention
by
which
the
south
poor
as
were
its
possibilities
for
might
have
rendered
impotent
as
once
or
twice
it
seemed
likely
to
do
the
northern
blockade
gideon
welles
the
responsible
cabinet
minister
was
constant
and
would
appear
to
have
been
capable
at
his
task
but
the
inspiring
mind
of
the
naval
department
was
found
in
gustavus
fox
a
retired
naval
officer
who
at
the
beginning
of
lincoln
administration
was
appointed
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
the
policy
of
blockade
was
begun
by
proclamation
on
april
it
was
a
hardy
measure
certain
to
be
a
cause
of
friction
with
foreign
powers
the
united
states
government
had
contended
in
that
a
blockade
which
is
to
confer
any
rights
against
neutral
commerce
must
be
an
effective
blockade
and
has
not
lately
been
inclined
to
take
lax
views
upon
such
questions
but
when
it
declared
its
blockade
of
the
south
it
possessed
only
three
steamships
of
war
with
which
to
make
it
effective
but
the
policy
was
stoutly
maintained
the
naval
department
at
the
very
first
set
about
buying
merchant
ships
in
northern
ports
and
adapting
them
to
warlike
use
and
building
ships
of
its
own
in
the
design
of
which
it
shortly
obtained
the
help
of
a
commission
of
congress
on
the
subject
of
ironclads
the
naval
department
had
at
least
the
fullest
support
and
encouragement
from
lincoln
in
the
whole
of
its
policy
everything
goes
to
show
that
he
followed
naval
affairs
carefully
but
that
as
he
found
them
conducted
on
sound
lines
by
men
that
he
trusted
his
intervention
in
them
was
of
a
modest
kind
welles
continued
throughout
the
member
of
his
cabinet
with
whom
he
had
the
least
friction
and
was
probably
one
of
those
ministers
common
in
england
who
earn
the
confidence
of
their
own
departments
without
in
any
way
impressing
the
imagination
of
the
public
and
a
letter
by
lincoln
to
fox
immediately
after
the
affair
of
fort
sumter
shows
the
hearty
esteem
and
confidence
with
which
from
the
first
he
regarded
fox
of
the
few
slight
records
of
his
judgment
in
these
matters
one
is
significant
the
unfortunate
expedition
against
charleston
in
the
spring
of
was
undertaken
with
high
hopes
by
the
naval
department
but
lincoln
we
happen
to
know
never
believed
it
could
succeed
he
has
rightly
or
wrongly
been
blamed
for
dealings
with
his
military
officers
in
which
he
may
be
said
to
have
spurred
them
hard
he
can
not
reasonably
be
blamed
for
giving
the
rein
to
his
expert
subordinates
because
his
own
judgment
which
differed
from
theirs
turned
out
right
this
is
one
of
very
many
instances
which
suggest
that
at
the
time
when
his
confidence
in
himself
was
full
grown
his
disposition
if
any
to
interfere
was
well
under
control
it
is
also
one
of
the
indications
that
his
attention
was
alert
in
many
matters
in
which
his
hand
was
not
seen
he
was
no
financier
and
that
important
part
of
the
history
of
the
war
northern
finance
concerns
us
little
the
real
economic
strength
of
the
north
was
immense
for
immigration
and
development
were
going
on
so
fast
that
for
all
the
strain
of
the
war
production
and
exports
increased
but
the
superficial
disturbance
caused
by
borrowing
and
the
issue
of
paper
money
was
great
and
though
the
north
never
bore
the
pinching
that
was
endured
in
the
south
it
is
an
honourable
thing
that
for
all
the
rise
in
the
cost
of
living
and
for
all
the
trouble
that
occurred
in
business
when
the
premium
on
gold
often
fluctuated
between
and
and
on
one
occasion
rose
to
neither
the
solid
working
class
of
the
country
generally
nor
the
solid
business
class
of
new
york
were
deeply
affected
by
the
grumbling
at
the
duration
of
the
war
the
american
verdict
upon
the
financial
policy
of
chase
a
man
of
intellect
but
new
to
such
affairs
is
one
of
high
praise
lincoln
left
him
free
in
that
policy
he
had
watched
the
acts
and
utterances
of
his
chief
contemporaries
closely
and
early
acquired
a
firm
belief
in
ability
how
much
praise
is
due
to
the
president
who
for
this
reason
kept
chase
in
his
cabinet
a
later
part
of
this
story
may
show
one
function
of
government
was
that
of
the
president
alone
an
english
statesman
is
alleged
to
have
said
upon
becoming
prime
minister
i
had
important
and
interesting
business
in
my
old
office
but
now
my
chief
duty
will
be
to
create
undeserving
peers
lincoln
in
the
anxious
days
that
followed
his
first
inauguration
once
looked
especially
harassed
a
senator
said
to
him
what
is
the
matter
president
is
there
bad
news
from
fort
sumter
oh
no
he
answered
it
the
post
office
at
baldinsville
the
patronage
of
the
president
was
enormous
including
the
most
trifling
offices
under
government
such
as
village
postmasterships
in
the
appointment
to
local
offices
he
was
expected
to
consult
the
local
senators
and
representatives
of
his
own
party
and
of
course
to
choose
men
who
had
worked
for
the
party
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
decent
competence
for
the
office
in
the
people
so
recommended
might
be
presumed
the
established
practice
further
required
that
a
republican
president
on
coming
in
should
replace
with
good
republicans
most
of
the
nominees
of
the
late
democratic
administration
which
had
done
the
like
in
its
day
lincoln
experience
after
a
while
led
him
to
prophesy
that
the
prevalence
of
would
be
the
ruin
of
american
politics
but
it
certainly
never
occurred
to
him
to
try
and
break
down
then
the
accepted
rule
of
which
no
party
yet
complained
it
would
have
been
unmeasured
folly
even
if
he
had
thought
of
it
to
have
taken
during
such
a
crisis
a
new
departure
which
would
have
vexed
the
republicans
far
more
than
it
would
have
pleased
the
democrats
and
at
that
time
it
was
really
of
great
consequence
that
public
officials
should
be
men
of
known
loyalty
to
the
union
for
obviously
a
postmaster
of
doubtful
loyalty
might
do
mischief
lincoln
then
except
in
dealing
with
posts
of
special
consequence
for
which
men
with
really
special
qualifications
were
to
be
found
frankly
and
without
a
question
took
as
the
great
principle
of
his
patronage
the
fairest
possible
distribution
of
favours
among
different
classes
and
individuals
among
the
supporters
of
the
government
whom
it
was
his
primary
duty
to
keep
together
his
attitude
in
the
whole
business
was
perfectly
understood
and
respected
by
scrupulous
men
who
watched
politics
critically
it
was
the
cause
in
one
way
of
great
worry
to
him
for
except
when
his
indignation
was
kindled
he
was
abnormally
reluctant
to
say
no
he
once
shuddered
to
think
what
would
have
happened
to
him
if
he
had
been
a
woman
but
was
consoled
by
the
thought
that
his
ugliness
would
have
been
a
shield
and
his
private
secretaries
accuse
him
of
carrying
out
his
principle
with
needless
and
even
ridiculous
care
in
appointments
to
which
the
party
principle
did
not
apply
but
in
which
an
ordinary
man
would
have
felt
party
prejudice
lincoln
old
opponents
were
often
startled
by
his
freedom
from
it
if
jobbery
be
the
right
name
for
his
persistent
endeavour
to
keep
the
partisans
of
the
union
pleased
and
united
his
jobbery
proved
to
have
one
shining
attribute
of
virtue
later
on
when
apart
from
the
democratic
opposition
which
revived
there
arose
in
the
republican
party
sections
hostile
to
himself
the
claims
of
personal
adherence
to
him
and
the
wavering
prospects
of
his
own
reelection
seem
from
recorded
instances
to
have
affected
his
choice
remarkably
little
policy
and
the
question
what
was
his
influence
upon
foreign
policy
is
more
difficult
than
the
general
praise
bestowed
upon
it
might
lead
us
to
expect
because
though
he
is
known
to
have
exercised
a
constant
supervision
over
seward
that
influence
was
concealed
from
the
diplomatic
world
for
at
least
the
first
eighteen
months
of
the
war
apart
from
lesser
points
of
quarrel
a
real
danger
of
foreign
intervention
hung
over
the
north
the
danger
was
increased
by
the
ambitions
of
napoleon
iii
in
regard
to
mexico
and
by
the
loss
and
suffering
caused
to
england
above
all
not
merely
from
the
interruption
of
trade
but
from
the
suspension
of
cotton
supplies
by
the
blockade
from
the
first
there
was
the
fear
that
foreign
powers
would
recognise
the
southern
confederacy
as
an
independent
country
that
they
were
then
likely
to
offer
mediation
which
it
would
at
the
best
have
been
embarrassing
for
the
president
to
reject
that
they
might
ultimately
when
their
mediation
had
been
rejected
be
tempted
to
active
intervention
it
is
curious
that
the
one
european
government
which
was
recognised
all
along
as
friendly
to
the
republic
was
that
of
the
czar
alexander
ii
of
russia
who
in
this
same
year
was
accomplishing
the
project
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
father
of
emancipating
the
serfs
mercier
the
french
minister
in
washington
advised
his
government
to
recognise
the
south
confederacy
as
early
as
march
the
emperor
of
the
french
though
not
the
french
people
inclined
throughout
to
this
policy
but
he
would
not
act
apart
from
england
and
the
english
government
though
americans
did
not
know
it
had
determined
and
for
the
present
was
quite
resolute
against
any
hasty
action
nevertheless
an
almost
accidental
cause
very
soon
brought
england
and
the
north
within
sight
of
a
war
from
which
neither
people
was
in
appearance
averse
neither
the
foreign
policy
of
lincoln
government
nor
indeed
the
relations
of
england
and
america
from
his
day
to
our
own
can
be
understood
without
some
study
of
the
attitude
of
the
two
countries
to
each
other
during
the
war
if
we
could
put
aside
any
previous
judgment
on
the
cause
as
between
north
and
south
there
are
still
some
marked
features
in
the
attitude
of
england
during
the
war
which
every
englishman
must
now
regret
it
should
emphatically
be
added
that
there
were
some
upon
which
every
englishman
should
look
back
with
satisfaction
many
of
the
expressions
of
english
opinion
at
that
time
betray
a
powerlessness
to
comprehend
another
country
and
a
in
judging
it
which
it
may
humbly
be
claimed
were
not
always
and
are
not
now
so
characteristic
of
englishmen
as
they
were
in
that
period
of
our
history
in
many
ways
so
noble
which
we
associate
with
the
rival
influences
of
palmerston
and
of
cobden
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
ordinary
english
gentlemen
started
with
a
leaning
towards
the
south
they
liked
southerners
and
there
was
much
in
the
manners
of
the
north
and
in
the
experiences
of
englishmen
trading
with
or
investing
in
the
north
which
did
not
impress
them
favourably
many
northerners
discovered
something
snobbish
and
unsound
in
this
preference
but
they
were
not
quite
right
with
this
leaning
englishmen
readily
accepted
the
plea
of
the
south
that
it
was
threatened
with
intolerable
interference
indeed
to
this
day
it
is
hardly
credible
to
englishmen
that
the
grievance
against
which
the
south
arose
in
such
passionate
revolt
was
so
unsubstantial
as
it
really
was
on
the
other
hand
the
case
of
the
north
was
not
apprehended
how
it
came
to
pass
in
the
intricate
and
usually
uninteresting
play
of
american
politics
that
a
business
community
which
had
seemed
pretty
tolerant
of
slavery
was
now
at
war
on
some
point
which
was
said
to
be
and
said
not
to
be
slavery
was
a
little
hard
to
understand
those
of
us
who
remember
our
parents
talk
of
the
american
civil
war
did
not
hear
from
them
the
true
and
fairly
simple
explanation
of
the
war
that
the
north
fought
because
it
refused
to
connive
further
in
the
extension
of
slavery
and
would
not
could
not
decently
accept
the
disruption
of
a
great
country
as
the
alternative
it
is
strictly
true
that
the
chivalrous
south
rose
in
blind
passion
for
a
cause
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
the
narrowest
of
pecuniary
interests
while
the
yankees
guided
by
a
sort
of
comic
backwoodsman
fought
whether
wisely
or
not
for
a
cause
as
untainted
as
ever
animated
a
nation
in
arms
but
it
seems
a
paradox
even
now
and
there
is
no
reproach
in
the
fact
that
our
fathers
who
had
not
followed
the
vacillating
course
of
northern
politics
hitherto
did
not
generally
take
it
in
we
shall
see
in
a
later
chapter
how
northern
statesmanship
added
to
their
perplexity
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
ashamed
of
some
of
the
forms
in
which
english
feeling
showed
itself
and
was
well
known
in
the
north
to
show
itself
not
only
the
articles
of
some
english
newspapers
but
the
private
letters
of
americans
who
then
found
themselves
in
the
politest
circles
in
london
are
unpleasant
to
read
now
it
is
painful
too
that
a
leader
of
political
thought
like
cobden
should
even
for
a
little
while
and
it
was
only
a
little
while
have
been
swayed
in
such
a
matter
by
a
sympathy
relatively
so
petty
as
agreement
with
the
southern
doctrine
of
free
trade
we
might
now
call
it
worthier
of
prussia
than
of
england
that
a
great
englishman
like
lord
salisbury
then
lord
robert
cecil
should
have
expressed
friendship
for
the
south
as
a
good
customer
of
ours
and
antagonism
for
the
north
as
a
rival
in
our
business
when
such
men
as
these
said
such
things
they
were
of
course
not
brutally
indifferent
to
right
they
were
merely
blind
to
the
fact
that
a
very
great
and
plain
issue
of
right
and
wrong
was
really
involved
in
the
war
gladstone
to
take
another
instance
was
not
blind
to
that
but
with
irritating
misapprehension
he
protested
against
the
madness
of
plunging
into
war
to
propagate
the
cause
of
emancipation
then
came
in
his
love
of
small
states
and
from
his
mouth
while
he
was
a
cabinet
minister
came
the
impulsive
pronouncement
bitterly
regretted
by
him
and
bitterly
resented
in
the
north
jefferson
davis
and
other
leaders
of
the
south
have
made
an
army
they
are
making
it
appears
a
navy
and
they
have
made
what
is
more
than
either
they
have
made
a
nation
many
other
englishmen
simply
sympathised
with
the
weaker
side
many
too
it
should
be
confessed
with
the
apparently
weaker
side
which
they
were
really
persuaded
would
win
win
the
battles
said
lord
robert
cecil
to
a
northern
lady
and
we
tories
shall
come
round
at
once
these
things
are
recalled
because
their
natural
effect
in
america
has
to
be
understood
what
is
really
lamentable
is
not
that
in
this
distant
and
debatable
affair
the
sympathy
of
so
many
inclined
to
the
south
but
that
when
at
least
there
was
a
northern
side
there
seemed
at
first
to
be
hardly
any
capable
of
understanding
or
being
stirred
by
it
apart
from
politicians
there
were
only
two
englishmen
of
the
first
rank
tennyson
and
darwin
who
whether
or
not
they
understood
the
matter
in
detail
are
known
to
have
cared
from
their
hearts
for
the
northern
cause
it
is
pleasant
to
associate
with
these
greater
names
that
of
the
author
of
tom
brown
the
names
of
those
hostile
to
the
north
or
apparently
quite
uninterested
are
numerous
and
surprising
even
dickens
who
had
hated
slavery
and
who
in
martin
chuzzlewit
had
appealed
however
bitterly
to
the
higher
national
spirit
which
he
thought
latent
in
america
now
when
that
spirit
had
at
last
and
in
deed
asserted
itself
gave
way
in
his
letters
to
nothing
but
hatred
of
the
whole
country
and
a
disposition
like
this
explicable
but
odious
did
no
doubt
exist
in
the
england
of
those
days
there
is
however
quite
another
aspect
of
this
question
besides
that
which
has
so
painfully
impressed
many
american
memories
when
the
largest
manufacturing
industry
of
england
was
brought
near
to
famine
by
the
blockade
the
voice
of
the
stricken
working
population
was
loudly
and
persistently
uttered
on
the
side
of
the
north
there
has
been
no
other
demonstration
so
splendid
of
the
spirit
which
remains
widely
diffused
among
individual
english
working
men
and
which
at
one
time
animated
labour
as
a
concentrated
political
force
john
bright
who
completely
grasped
the
situation
in
america
took
a
stand
in
which
mill
forster
and
the
duke
of
argyll
share
his
credit
but
which
did
peculiar
and
great
honour
to
him
as
a
quaker
who
hated
war
but
there
is
something
more
that
must
be
said
the
conduct
of
the
english
government
supported
by
the
responsible
leaders
of
the
opposition
was
at
that
time
no
less
than
now
the
surest
indication
of
the
more
feelings
of
the
real
bulk
of
englishmen
on
any
great
question
affecting
our
international
relations
and
the
attitude
of
the
government
in
which
lord
palmerston
was
prime
minister
and
lord
john
russell
foreign
secretary
and
with
which
in
this
matter
conservative
leaders
like
disraeli
and
sir
stafford
northcote
entirely
concurred
was
at
the
very
least
free
from
grave
reproach
lord
john
russell
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
his
colleagues
generally
regarded
slavery
as
an
accursed
institution
but
they
felt
no
anger
with
the
people
of
the
south
for
it
because
as
he
said
we
gave
them
that
curse
and
ours
were
the
hands
from
which
they
received
that
fatal
gift
in
lord
john
at
least
the
one
overmastering
sentiment
upon
the
outbreak
of
the
war
was
that
of
sheer
pain
that
a
great
republic
which
has
enjoyed
institutions
under
which
the
people
have
been
free
and
happy
is
placed
in
jeopardy
their
insight
into
american
affairs
did
not
go
deep
but
the
more
seriously
we
rate
the
strong
antipathy
to
the
north
the
strong
sympathy
with
the
south
and
the
passionate
wish
to
have
cotton
of
which
a
minister
lord
granville
wrote
at
the
time
the
greater
is
the
credit
due
both
to
the
government
as
a
whole
and
to
disraeli
for
having
been
conspicuously
unmoved
by
these
considerations
and
the
general
approval
from
parliament
the
press
and
the
public
which
as
lord
granville
added
their
policy
received
is
creditable
too
it
is
perfectly
true
as
will
be
seen
later
that
at
one
dark
moment
in
the
fortunes
of
the
north
the
government
very
cautiously
considered
the
possibility
of
intervention
but
disraeli
to
whom
a
less
patriotic
course
would
have
offered
a
party
advantage
recalled
to
them
their
own
better
judgment
and
it
is
impossible
to
read
their
correspondence
on
this
question
without
perceiving
that
in
this
they
were
actuated
by
no
hostility
to
the
north
but
by
a
sincere
belief
that
the
cause
of
the
north
was
hopeless
and
that
intervention
with
a
view
to
stopping
bloodshed
might
prove
the
course
of
honest
friendship
to
all
america
englishmen
of
a
later
time
have
become
deeply
interested
in
america
and
may
wish
that
their
fathers
had
better
understood
the
great
issue
of
the
civil
war
but
it
is
matter
for
pride
which
in
honesty
should
be
here
asserted
that
with
many
selfish
interests
in
this
contest
of
which
they
were
most
keenly
aware
englishmen
in
their
capacity
as
a
nation
acted
with
complete
integrity
but
for
our
immediate
purpose
the
object
of
thus
reviewing
a
subject
on
which
american
historians
have
lavished
much
research
is
to
explain
the
effect
produced
in
america
by
demonstrations
of
strong
antipathy
and
sympathy
in
england
the
effect
in
some
ways
has
been
long
lasting
the
south
caught
at
every
mark
of
sympathy
with
avidity
was
led
by
its
politicians
to
expect
help
received
none
and
became
resentful
it
is
surprising
to
be
told
but
may
be
true
that
the
embers
of
this
resentment
became
dangerous
to
england
in
the
autumn
of
in
the
north
the
memory
of
an
antipathy
which
was
almost
instantly
perceived
has
burnt
deep
as
many
memoirs
for
instance
those
recently
published
by
senator
lodge
show
into
the
minds
of
precisely
those
americans
to
whom
englishmen
have
ever
since
been
the
readiest
to
accord
their
esteem
there
were
many
men
in
the
north
with
a
dislike
of
england
but
there
were
many
also
whose
sensitiveness
to
english
opinion
if
in
some
ways
difficult
for
us
to
appreciate
was
intense
republicans
such
as
james
russell
lowell
had
writhed
under
the
reproaches
cast
by
englishmen
upon
the
acquiescence
of
all
america
in
slavery
they
felt
that
the
north
had
suddenly
cut
off
this
reproach
and
staked
everything
on
the
refusal
to
give
way
to
slavery
any
further
they
looked
now
for
expressions
of
sympathy
from
many
quarters
in
england
but
in
the
english
newspapers
which
they
read
and
the
reports
of
americans
in
england
they
found
evidence
of
nothing
but
dislike
there
soon
came
evidence
as
it
seemed
to
the
whole
north
of
actually
hostile
action
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
it
issued
a
proclamation
enjoining
neutrality
upon
british
subjects
this
was
a
matter
of
course
on
the
outbreak
of
what
was
nothing
less
than
war
but
northerners
thought
that
at
least
some
courteous
explanation
should
first
have
been
made
to
their
government
and
there
were
other
matters
which
they
misinterpreted
as
signs
of
an
agreement
of
england
with
france
to
go
further
and
open
diplomatic
relations
with
the
confederate
government
thus
alike
in
the
most
prejudiced
and
in
the
most
enlightened
quarters
in
the
north
there
arose
an
irritation
which
an
englishman
must
see
to
have
been
natural
but
can
hardly
think
to
have
been
warranted
by
the
real
facts
here
came
in
the
one
clearly
known
and
most
certainly
happy
intervention
of
lincoln
in
foreign
affairs
early
in
may
seward
brought
to
him
the
draft
of
a
vehement
despatch
telling
the
british
government
peremptorily
what
the
united
states
would
not
stand
and
framed
in
a
manner
which
must
have
frustrated
any
attempt
by
adams
in
london
to
establish
good
relations
with
lord
john
russell
that
draft
now
exists
with
the
alterations
made
in
lincoln
own
hand
with
a
few
touches
some
of
them
very
minute
made
with
the
skill
of
a
master
of
language
and
of
a
peacemaker
he
changed
the
draft
into
a
firm
but
entirely
courteous
despatch
in
particular
instead
of
requiring
adams
as
seward
would
have
done
to
read
the
whole
despatch
to
russell
and
leave
him
with
a
copy
of
it
he
left
it
to
the
man
on
the
spot
to
convey
its
sense
in
what
manner
he
judged
best
probably
as
has
been
claimed
for
him
his
few
penstrokes
made
peaceful
relations
easy
when
seward
despatch
would
have
made
them
almost
impossible
certainly
a
study
of
this
document
will
prove
both
his
strange
untutored
diplomatic
skill
and
the
general
soundness
of
his
view
of
foreign
affairs
now
however
followed
a
graver
crisis
in
which
his
action
requires
some
discussion
mason
and
slidell
were
sent
by
the
confederate
government
as
their
emissaries
to
england
and
france
they
got
to
havana
and
there
took
ship
again
on
the
british
steamer
a
watchful
northern
sea
captain
overhauled
the
took
mason
and
slidell
off
her
and
let
her
go
if
he
had
taken
the
course
far
more
inconvenient
to
the
of
bringing
her
into
a
northern
harbour
where
a
northern
prize
court
might
have
adjudged
these
gentlemen
to
be
bearers
of
enemy
despatches
he
would
have
been
within
the
law
as
it
was
he
violated
usage
and
no
one
has
questioned
the
right
and
even
the
duty
of
the
british
government
to
demand
the
release
of
the
prisoners
this
they
did
in
a
note
of
which
the
expression
was
made
milder
by
the
wish
of
the
queen
conveyed
in
almost
the
last
letter
of
the
prince
consort
but
which
required
compliance
within
a
fortnight
meanwhile
secretary
welles
had
approved
the
sea
action
the
north
was
jubilant
at
the
capture
the
more
so
because
mason
and
slidell
were
southern
statesmen
of
the
lower
type
and
held
to
be
specially
obnoxious
and
the
house
of
representatives
to
make
matters
worse
voted
its
approval
of
what
had
been
done
lincoln
on
the
very
day
when
the
news
of
the
capture
came
had
seen
and
said
privately
that
on
the
principles
which
america
had
itself
upheld
in
the
past
the
prisoners
would
have
to
be
given
up
with
an
apology
but
there
is
evidence
that
he
now
wavered
and
that
bent
as
he
was
on
maintaining
a
united
north
he
was
still
too
distrustful
of
his
own
better
judgment
as
against
that
of
the
public
at
this
very
time
he
was
already
on
other
points
in
painful
conflict
with
many
friends
in
any
case
he
submitted
to
seward
a
draft
despatch
making
the
proposal
of
arbitration
he
gave
way
to
seward
but
at
the
cabinet
meeting
on
christmas
eve
at
which
seward
submitted
a
despatch
yielding
to
the
british
demand
it
is
reported
that
lincoln
as
well
as
chase
and
others
was
at
first
reluctant
to
agree
and
that
it
was
bates
and
seward
that
persuaded
the
cabinet
to
a
just
and
necessary
surrender
this
was
the
last
time
that
there
was
serious
friction
in
the
actual
intercourse
of
the
two
governments
the
lapse
of
great
britain
in
allowing
the
famous
to
sail
was
due
to
delay
and
misadventure
or
the
like
in
the
proceedings
of
subordinate
officials
and
was
never
defended
and
the
numerous
minor
controversies
that
arose
as
well
as
the
standing
disagreement
as
to
the
law
of
blockade
never
reached
the
point
of
danger
for
all
this
great
credit
was
due
to
lord
lyons
and
to
adams
and
to
seward
also
when
he
had
a
little
sobered
down
but
it
might
seem
as
if
the
credit
commonly
given
to
lincoln
by
americans
rested
on
little
but
the
single
happy
performance
with
the
earlier
despatch
which
has
been
mentioned
adams
and
lyons
were
not
aware
of
his
beneficent
influence
the
papers
of
the
latter
contain
little
reference
to
him
beyond
a
kindly
record
of
a
trivial
conversation
at
the
end
of
which
as
the
ambassador
was
going
for
a
holiday
to
england
the
president
said
tell
the
english
people
i
mean
them
no
harm
yet
it
is
evident
that
lincoln
supporters
in
america
the
writer
of
the
biglow
papers
for
instance
ascribed
to
him
a
wise
restraining
power
in
the
dispute
what
is
more
lincoln
later
claimed
this
for
himself
two
or
three
years
later
in
one
of
the
confidences
with
which
he
often
startled
men
who
were
but
slight
acquaintances
but
who
generally
turned
out
worthy
of
confidence
he
exclaimed
with
emphatic
seward
knows
that
i
am
his
master
and
recalled
with
satisfaction
how
he
had
forced
seward
to
yield
to
england
in
the
affair
it
would
have
been
entirely
unlike
him
to
claim
praise
when
it
was
wholly
undue
to
him
we
find
him
for
example
writing
to
fox
of
the
navy
department
about
a
blunder
which
was
probably
in
part
mine
and
certainly
was
not
yours
so
that
a
puzzling
question
arises
here
it
is
quite
possible
that
lincoln
who
did
not
press
his
proposal
of
arbitration
really
manoeuvred
seward
and
the
cabinet
into
full
acceptance
of
the
british
demands
by
making
them
see
the
consequences
of
any
other
action
it
is
also
however
likely
enough
that
being
as
he
was
interested
in
arbitration
generally
he
was
too
inexperienced
to
see
the
inappropriateness
of
the
proposal
in
this
case
if
so
we
may
none
the
less
credit
him
with
having
forced
seward
to
work
for
peace
and
friendly
relations
with
great
britain
and
made
that
minister
the
agent
more
skilful
than
himself
of
a
peaceful
resolution
which
in
its
origin
was
his
own
great
questions
of
domestic
the
larger
questions
of
civil
policy
which
arose
out
of
the
fact
of
the
war
and
which
weighed
heavily
on
lincoln
before
the
end
of
can
be
related
with
less
intricate
detail
if
the
fundamental
point
of
difficulty
is
made
clear
upon
july
congress
met
in
an
able
message
which
was
a
skilful
but
simple
appeal
not
only
to
congress
but
to
the
plain
people
the
president
set
forth
the
nature
of
the
struggle
as
he
conceived
it
putting
perhaps
in
its
most
powerful
form
the
contention
that
the
union
was
indissoluble
and
declaring
that
the
experiment
of
our
popular
government
would
have
failed
once
for
all
if
it
did
not
prove
that
when
ballots
have
fairly
and
constitutionally
decided
there
can
be
no
successful
appeal
back
to
bullets
he
recounted
the
steps
which
he
had
taken
since
the
bombardment
of
fort
sumter
some
of
which
might
be
held
to
exceed
his
constitutional
authority
as
indeed
they
did
saying
he
would
have
been
false
to
his
trust
if
for
fear
of
such
illegality
he
had
let
the
whole
constitution
perish
and
asking
that
if
necessary
congress
should
ratify
them
he
appealed
to
congress
now
to
do
its
part
and
especially
he
appealed
for
such
prompt
and
adequate
provision
of
money
and
men
as
would
enable
the
war
to
be
speedily
brought
to
a
close
congress
with
but
a
few
dissentient
voices
chiefly
from
the
border
states
approved
all
that
he
had
done
and
voted
the
supplies
that
he
had
asked
then
by
a
resolution
of
both
houses
it
defined
the
object
of
the
war
the
war
was
not
for
any
purpose
of
conquest
or
subjugation
or
of
overthrowing
or
interfering
with
the
rights
or
established
institutions
of
the
southern
states
it
was
solely
to
preserve
the
union
with
all
the
dignity
equality
and
rights
of
the
several
states
unimpaired
in
this
resolution
may
be
found
the
clue
to
the
supreme
political
problem
with
which
side
by
side
with
the
conduct
of
the
war
lincoln
was
called
upon
to
grapple
unceasingly
for
the
rest
of
his
life
that
problem
lay
in
the
inevitable
change
as
the
war
dragged
on
of
the
political
object
involved
in
it
the
north
as
yet
was
not
making
war
upon
the
institutions
of
southern
states
in
other
words
upon
slavery
and
it
would
have
been
wrong
to
do
so
it
was
simply
asserting
the
supremacy
of
law
by
putting
down
what
every
man
in
the
north
regarded
as
rebellion
that
rebellion
it
seemed
likely
would
completely
subside
after
a
decisive
defeat
or
two
of
the
southern
forces
the
law
and
the
union
would
then
have
been
restored
as
before
a
great
victory
would
in
fact
have
been
won
over
slavery
for
the
policy
of
restricting
its
further
spread
would
have
prevailed
but
the
constitutional
right
of
each
southern
state
to
retain
slavery
within
its
borders
was
not
to
be
denied
by
those
who
were
fighting
as
they
claimed
for
the
constitution
such
at
first
was
the
position
taken
up
by
an
unanimous
congress
it
was
obviously
in
accord
with
those
political
principles
of
lincoln
which
have
been
examined
in
a
former
chapter
more
than
that
it
was
the
position
which
as
he
thought
his
official
duty
as
president
imposed
on
him
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
for
any
englishman
to
follow
his
course
as
the
political
situation
developed
he
was
neither
a
dictator
nor
an
english
prime
minister
he
was
first
and
foremost
an
elected
officer
with
powers
and
duties
prescribed
by
a
fixed
constitution
which
he
had
sworn
to
obey
his
oath
was
continually
present
to
his
mind
he
was
there
to
uphold
the
union
and
the
laws
with
just
so
much
infraction
of
the
letter
of
the
law
and
no
more
as
might
be
obviously
necessary
if
the
union
and
the
whole
fabric
of
law
were
not
to
perish
the
mere
duration
of
the
war
altered
of
necessity
the
policy
of
the
north
and
of
the
president
their
task
had
presented
itself
as
in
theory
the
suppression
of
an
unlawful
combination
within
their
country
it
became
in
manifest
fact
the
reabsorption
of
a
country
now
hostile
with
which
reunion
was
possible
only
if
slavery
the
fundamental
cause
of
difference
was
uprooted
as
the
hope
of
a
speedy
victory
and
an
easy
settlement
vanished
wide
differences
of
opinion
appeared
again
in
the
north
and
the
lines
on
which
this
cleavage
proceeded
very
soon
showed
themselves
there
were
those
who
gladly
welcomed
the
idea
of
a
crusade
against
slavery
and
among
them
was
an
unreasonable
section
of
radicals
these
resented
that
delay
in
a
policy
of
wholesale
liberation
which
was
enforced
by
legal
and
constitutional
scruples
and
by
such
practical
considerations
as
the
situation
in
the
slave
states
which
adhered
to
the
north
there
was
on
the
other
hand
a
democratic
party
opposition
which
before
long
began
to
revive
it
combined
many
shades
of
opinion
there
were
supporters
or
actual
agents
of
the
south
few
at
first
and
very
quiet
but
ultimately
developing
a
treasonable
activity
there
were
those
who
constituted
themselves
the
guardians
of
legality
and
jealously
criticised
all
the
measures
of
emergency
which
became
more
or
less
necessary
of
the
bulk
of
the
democrats
it
would
probably
be
fair
to
say
that
their
conscious
intention
throughout
was
to
be
true
to
the
union
but
that
throughout
they
were
beset
by
a
respect
for
southern
rights
which
would
have
gone
far
to
paralyse
the
arm
of
the
government
lastly
there
were
republicans
by
no
means
in
sympathy
with
the
democratic
view
who
became
suspect
to
their
radical
fellows
and
were
vaguely
classed
together
as
conservatives
this
term
may
be
taken
to
cover
men
simply
of
moderate
and
cautious
or
in
some
cases
of
variable
disposition
but
it
included
too
some
men
who
while
rigorous
against
the
south
were
in
their
detestation
of
slavery
so
far
as
lincoln
private
opinions
were
concerned
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
rank
him
in
any
of
these
sections
he
had
as
strong
a
sympathy
with
the
southern
people
as
any
democrat
but
he
was
for
the
restoration
of
the
union
absolutely
and
without
compromise
he
was
the
most
cautious
of
men
but
his
caution
veiled
a
detestation
of
slavery
of
which
he
once
said
that
he
could
not
remember
the
time
when
he
had
not
felt
it
it
was
his
business
so
far
as
might
be
to
retain
the
support
of
all
sections
in
the
north
to
the
union
in
the
course
full
of
painful
deliberation
which
we
shall
see
him
pursuing
he
tried
to
be
guided
by
a
principle
which
he
constantly
avowed
the
union
was
to
be
restored
with
as
few
departures
from
the
ways
of
the
constitution
as
was
possible
but
such
departures
became
his
duty
whenever
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
they
were
needful
for
the
restoration
of
the
union
before
the
war
was
four
months
old
the
inevitable
subject
of
dispute
between
northern
parties
had
begun
to
trouble
lincoln
as
soon
as
a
northern
force
set
foot
on
southern
soil
slaves
were
apt
to
escape
to
it
and
the
question
arose
what
should
the
northern
general
do
with
them
for
he
was
not
there
to
make
war
on
the
private
property
of
southern
citizens
general
butler
a
newspaper
character
of
some
fame
or
notoriety
throughout
the
war
commanded
at
fort
monroe
a
point
on
the
coast
of
virginia
which
was
always
held
by
the
north
he
learnt
that
the
slaves
who
fled
to
him
had
been
employed
on
making
entrenchments
for
the
southern
troops
so
he
adopted
a
view
which
took
the
fancy
of
the
north
that
they
were
contraband
of
war
and
should
be
kept
from
their
owners
the
circumstances
in
which
slaves
could
thus
escape
varied
so
much
that
great
discretion
must
be
left
to
the
general
on
the
spot
and
the
practice
of
generals
varied
lincoln
was
well
content
to
leave
the
matter
so
congress
however
passed
an
act
by
which
private
property
could
be
confiscated
if
used
in
aid
of
the
insurrection
but
not
otherwise
and
slaves
were
similarly
dealt
with
this
moderate
provision
as
to
slaves
met
with
a
certain
amount
of
opposition
it
raised
an
alarming
question
in
slave
states
like
missouri
that
had
not
seceded
lincoln
himself
seems
to
have
been
averse
to
any
legislation
on
the
subject
he
had
deliberately
concentrated
his
mind
or
as
his
critics
would
have
said
narrowed
it
down
to
the
sole
question
of
maintaining
the
union
and
was
resolved
to
treat
all
other
questions
as
subordinate
to
this
shortly
after
there
reappeared
upon
the
political
scene
a
leader
with
what
might
seem
a
more
sympathetic
outlook
this
was
frémont
lincoln
predecessor
as
the
republican
candidate
for
the
presidency
frémont
was
one
of
those
men
who
make
brilliant
and
romantic
figures
in
their
earlier
career
and
later
appear
to
have
lost
all
solid
qualities
it
must
be
recalled
that
though
scarcely
a
professional
soldier
for
he
had
held
a
commission
but
served
only
in
the
ordnance
survey
he
had
conducted
a
great
exploring
expedition
had
seen
fighting
as
a
in
california
and
it
is
claimed
had
with
his
handful
of
men
done
much
to
win
that
great
state
from
mexico
add
to
this
that
he
a
southerner
by
birth
was
known
among
the
leaders
who
had
made
california
a
free
state
and
it
is
plain
how
appropriate
it
must
have
seemed
when
he
was
set
to
command
the
western
department
which
for
the
moment
meant
missouri
here
by
want
of
competence
and
which
was
more
surprising
lethargy
he
had
made
a
present
of
some
successes
to
a
southern
invading
force
and
had
sacrificed
the
promising
life
of
general
lyon
lincoln
loath
to
remove
him
had
made
a
good
effort
at
helping
him
out
by
tactfully
persuading
a
more
experienced
general
to
serve
as
a
subordinate
on
his
staff
at
the
end
of
august
frémont
suddenly
issued
a
proclamation
establishing
martial
law
throughout
missouri
this
contained
other
dangerous
provisions
but
above
all
it
liberated
the
slaves
and
confiscated
the
whole
property
of
all
persons
proved
before
court
martial
to
have
taken
active
part
with
the
enemy
in
the
field
it
is
obvious
that
such
a
measure
was
liable
to
shocking
abuse
that
it
was
certain
to
infuriate
many
friends
of
the
union
and
that
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
law
which
congress
had
just
passed
on
the
subject
to
lincoln
mind
it
presented
the
alarming
prospect
that
it
might
turn
the
scale
against
the
union
cause
in
the
still
pending
deliberations
in
kentucky
lincoln
overpowering
solicitude
on
such
a
point
is
among
the
proofs
that
his
understanding
of
the
military
situation
however
elementary
was
sound
he
wished
characteristically
that
frémont
himself
should
withdraw
his
proclamation
he
invited
him
to
withdraw
it
in
private
letters
from
which
one
sentence
may
be
taken
you
speak
of
it
as
being
the
only
means
of
saving
the
government
on
the
contrary
it
is
itself
the
surrender
of
the
government
can
it
be
pretended
that
it
is
any
longer
the
government
of
the
united
states
any
government
of
constitution
and
laws
wherein
a
general
or
a
president
may
make
permanent
rules
of
property
by
proclamation
frémont
preferred
to
make
lincoln
publicly
overrule
him
which
he
did
and
the
inevitable
consequence
followed
when
some
months
later
the
utter
military
disorganisation
which
frémont
let
arise
while
he
busied
himself
with
politics
and
the
scandalous
waste
out
of
which
his
flatterers
enriched
themselves
compelled
the
president
to
remove
him
from
his
command
frémont
became
for
a
time
at
least
to
patriotic
crowds
and
to
many
intelligent
upright
and
earnest
men
from
louis
to
boston
the
chivalrous
and
soldier
of
freedom
and
lincoln
the
soulless
politician
dead
to
the
cause
of
liberty
who
to
gratify
a
few
friends
had
struck
this
hero
down
on
the
eve
of
victory
to
his
army
an
army
which
by
the
way
he
had
reduced
almost
to
nonentity
this
salient
instance
explains
well
enough
the
nature
of
one
half
of
the
trial
which
lincoln
throughout
the
war
had
to
undergo
pursuing
the
restoration
of
the
union
with
a
thoroughness
which
must
estrange
from
him
the
democrats
of
the
north
he
was
fated
from
the
first
to
estrange
also
radicals
who
were
generally
as
devoted
to
the
union
as
himself
and
with
whose
hatred
of
slavery
he
really
sympathised
in
the
following
chapter
we
are
more
concerned
with
the
other
half
of
his
trial
the
war
itself
of
his
minor
political
difficulties
few
instances
need
be
given
only
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
were
many
and
involved
besides
delicate
questions
of
principle
the
careful
sifting
of
much
confident
hearsay
and
though
the
critics
of
public
men
are
wont
to
forget
it
that
there
are
only
hours
in
the
day
but
the
year
was
to
close
with
a
further
vexation
that
must
be
related
secretary
cameron
proved
incapable
on
the
business
side
of
war
administration
waste
and
alleged
corruption
called
down
upon
him
a
searching
investigation
by
a
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
he
had
not
added
to
his
own
considerable
riches
but
his
political
henchmen
had
grown
fat
the
displeasure
with
the
whole
administration
was
the
greater
because
the
war
was
not
progressing
favourably
or
at
all
there
were
complaints
of
the
naval
department
also
but
politicians
testified
their
belief
in
the
honesty
of
welles
without
saying
a
word
for
cameron
there
is
every
reason
to
think
he
was
not
personally
dishonourable
lincoln
believed
in
his
complete
integrity
and
so
also
did
sterner
critics
chase
an
apostle
of
economy
and
uprightness
and
senator
sumner
but
he
had
to
go
he
opened
the
door
for
his
removal
by
a
circular
to
generals
on
the
subject
of
slaves
which
was
comparable
to
frémont
proclamation
and
of
which
lincoln
had
to
forbid
the
issue
he
accepted
the
appointment
of
minister
to
russia
and
when
before
long
he
returned
he
justified
himself
and
lincoln
judgment
by
his
disinterested
friendship
and
support
he
was
removed
from
the
war
office
at
the
end
of
december
and
a
remarkable
incident
followed
while
lincoln
heart
was
still
set
on
his
law
practice
the
prospect
of
appearing
as
something
more
than
a
backwoods
attorney
smiled
for
a
single
moment
on
him
he
was
briefed
to
appear
in
an
important
case
outside
illinois
with
an
eminent
lawyer
from
the
east
edwin
stanton
but
he
was
not
allowed
to
open
his
mouth
for
stanton
snuffed
him
out
with
supreme
contempt
and
he
returned
home
crestfallen
stanton
before
the
war
was
a
strong
democrat
but
hated
slavery
in
the
last
days
of
buchanan
presidency
he
was
made
and
helped
much
to
restore
the
lost
credit
of
that
administration
he
was
now
in
washington
criticising
the
slow
conduct
of
the
war
with
that
explosive
fury
and
scorn
which
led
him
to
commit
frequent
injustice
at
the
very
end
of
the
war
he
publicly
and
monstrously
accused
sherman
of
being
bribed
into
terms
of
peace
by
southern
gold
which
concealed
from
most
eyes
his
real
kindness
and
a
lurking
tenderness
of
heart
but
which
made
him
a
vigorous
administrator
intolerant
of
dishonesty
and
inefficiency
he
was
more
contemptuous
of
lincoln
than
ever
he
would
constantly
be
denouncing
his
imbecility
and
it
is
incredible
that
kind
friends
were
wanting
to
convey
his
opinion
to
lincoln
lincoln
made
him
secretary
of
war
since
the
summer
to
the
impatient
bewilderment
of
the
northern
people
of
congress
now
again
in
session
and
of
the
president
himself
their
armies
in
the
field
were
accomplishing
just
nothing
at
all
and
as
this
agitating
year
closed
a
deep
gloom
settled
on
the
north
to
be
broken
after
a
while
by
the
glare
of
recurrent
disaster
chapter
ix
the
disasters
of
the
north
policy
of
the
the
story
of
the
war
has
here
to
be
told
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
civilian
administrator
the
president
stirring
incidents
of
combat
and
much
else
of
interest
must
be
neglected
episodes
in
the
war
which
peculiarly
concerned
him
or
have
given
rise
to
controversy
about
him
must
be
related
lengthily
the
president
was
an
inexperienced
man
it
should
be
said
too
for
respect
requires
perfect
frankness
that
he
was
one
of
an
inexperienced
people
the
americans
had
conquered
their
independence
from
great
britain
at
the
time
when
the
ruling
factions
of
our
country
had
reached
their
utmost
degree
of
inefficiency
they
had
fought
an
indecisive
war
with
us
in
while
our
main
business
was
to
win
at
salamanca
and
vittoria
these
experiences
in
some
ways
warped
american
ideas
of
war
and
politics
and
their
influence
perhaps
survives
to
this
day
the
extent
of
the
president
authority
and
his
position
in
regard
to
the
advice
he
could
obtain
have
been
explained
an
examination
of
the
tangle
in
which
military
policy
was
first
involved
may
make
the
chief
incidents
of
the
war
throughout
easier
to
follow
immediately
after
bull
run
mcclellan
had
been
summoned
to
washington
to
command
the
army
of
the
potomac
in
november
scott
worn
out
by
infirmity
and
finding
his
authority
slighted
by
my
ambitious
junior
retired
and
thereupon
mcclellan
while
retaining
his
immediate
command
upon
the
potomac
was
made
for
the
time
over
all
the
armies
of
the
north
there
were
it
should
be
repeated
two
other
principal
armies
besides
that
of
the
potomac
the
army
of
the
ohio
of
which
general
buell
was
given
command
in
july
and
that
of
the
west
to
which
general
halleck
was
appointed
though
frémont
seems
to
have
retained
independent
command
in
missouri
all
these
armies
were
in
an
early
stage
of
formation
and
training
and
from
a
purely
military
point
of
view
there
could
be
no
haste
to
undertake
a
movement
of
invasion
with
any
of
them
three
distinct
views
of
military
policy
were
presented
to
lincoln
in
the
early
days
scott
as
soon
as
it
was
clear
that
the
south
meant
real
fighting
saw
how
serious
its
resistance
would
be
his
military
judgment
was
in
favour
of
a
strictly
defensive
attitude
before
washington
of
training
the
volunteers
for
at
least
four
months
in
healthy
camps
and
of
then
pushing
a
large
army
right
down
the
mississippi
valley
to
new
orleans
making
the
whole
line
of
that
river
secure
and
establishing
a
pressure
on
the
south
between
this
western
army
and
the
naval
blockade
which
must
slowly
have
strangled
the
confederacy
he
was
aware
that
public
impatience
might
not
allow
a
rigid
adherence
to
his
policy
and
in
fact
when
his
view
was
made
public
before
bull
run
scott
anaconda
coiling
itself
round
the
confederacy
was
the
subject
of
general
derision
the
view
of
the
northern
public
and
of
the
influential
men
in
congress
was
in
favour
of
speedy
and
as
it
was
hoped
decisive
action
and
this
was
understood
as
involving
whatever
else
was
done
an
attempt
soon
to
capture
richmond
in
mcclellan
view
as
in
scott
the
first
object
was
the
full
preparation
of
the
army
but
he
would
have
wished
to
wait
till
he
had
a
fully
trained
force
of
men
on
the
potomac
and
a
powerful
fleet
with
many
transports
to
support
his
movements
and
when
he
had
all
this
to
move
southwards
in
irresistible
force
both
advancing
direct
into
virginia
and
landing
at
points
on
the
coast
subduing
each
of
the
atlantic
states
of
the
confederacy
in
turn
if
the
indefinite
delay
and
the
overwhelming
force
which
his
fancy
pictured
could
have
been
granted
him
it
is
plain
the
military
critics
have
said
that
he
could
not
have
destroyed
the
southern
armies
they
would
have
withdrawn
inland
and
the
heart
of
the
confederacy
would
have
remained
untouched
but
neither
the
time
nor
the
force
for
which
he
wished
could
be
allowed
him
so
he
had
to
put
aside
his
plan
but
in
some
ways
perhaps
it
still
influenced
him
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
disregard
the
wishes
of
those
who
in
the
last
resort
were
masters
for
a
vigorous
attempt
on
richmond
and
the
continually
unsuccessful
attempts
that
were
made
did
serve
a
military
purpose
for
they
kept
up
a
constant
drain
upon
the
resources
of
the
south
in
any
policy
the
objects
both
of
scott
plan
and
of
the
popular
plan
would
have
been
borne
in
mind
that
no
such
policy
was
consistently
followed
from
the
first
was
partly
a
result
of
the
difficulty
in
finding
any
younger
man
who
could
adequately
take
the
place
of
scott
it
was
not
for
a
want
of
clear
ideas
right
or
wrong
on
lincoln
part
only
two
days
after
the
battle
of
bull
run
he
put
on
paper
his
own
view
as
to
the
future
employment
of
the
three
armies
he
thought
that
one
should
threaten
richmond
that
one
should
move
from
cincinnati
in
ohio
by
a
pass
called
cumberland
gap
in
kentucky
upon
knoxville
in
eastern
tennessee
and
that
the
third
using
cairo
on
the
mississippi
as
its
base
should
advance
upon
memphis
some
miles
further
south
on
that
river
apparently
he
did
not
at
first
wish
to
commit
the
army
of
the
potomac
very
deeply
in
its
advance
on
richmond
and
he
certainly
wished
throughout
that
it
should
cover
washington
against
any
possible
attack
memphis
was
one
of
the
three
points
at
which
the
southern
railway
system
touched
the
great
river
and
communicated
with
the
states
beyond
vicksburg
and
new
orleans
much
further
south
were
the
others
knoxville
again
is
a
point
by
occupying
which
the
northern
forces
would
have
cut
the
direct
railway
communication
between
virginia
and
the
west
but
for
this
move
into
eastern
tennessee
lincoln
had
other
reasons
nearer
his
heart
the
people
of
that
region
were
strongly
for
the
union
they
were
invaded
by
the
confederates
and
held
down
by
severe
coercion
and
distressing
appeals
from
them
for
help
kept
arriving
through
the
autumn
could
they
have
been
succoured
and
their
mountainous
country
occupied
by
the
north
a
great
stronghold
of
the
union
would
it
seemed
to
lincoln
have
been
planted
securely
far
into
the
midst
of
the
confederacy
therefore
he
persistently
urged
this
part
of
his
scheme
on
the
attention
of
his
generals
the
chief
military
objection
raised
by
buell
was
that
his
army
would
have
to
advance
miles
from
the
nearest
base
of
supply
upon
a
railway
for
miles
to
the
west
of
the
alleghanies
there
were
no
railways
running
from
north
to
south
to
meet
this
lincoln
in
september
urged
upon
a
meeting
of
important
senators
and
representatives
the
construction
of
a
railway
line
from
lexington
in
kentucky
southwards
but
his
hearers
with
their
minds
narrowed
down
to
an
advance
on
richmond
seem
to
have
thought
the
relatively
small
cost
in
time
and
money
of
this
work
too
great
lincoln
still
thought
an
expedition
to
eastern
tennessee
practicable
at
once
and
it
has
been
argued
from
the
circumstances
in
which
one
was
made
nearly
two
years
later
that
he
was
right
it
would
one
may
suppose
have
been
unwise
to
separate
the
armies
of
the
ohio
and
of
the
west
so
widely
for
the
main
army
of
the
confederates
in
the
west
under
their
most
trusted
general
albert
sidney
johnston
was
from
september
onwards
in
kentucky
and
could
have
struck
at
either
of
these
two
northern
armies
and
this
was
in
buell
mind
on
the
other
hand
lincoln
object
was
a
wise
one
in
itself
and
would
have
been
worth
some
postponement
of
the
advance
along
the
mississippi
if
thereby
the
army
in
the
west
could
have
been
used
in
support
of
it
however
this
may
be
the
fact
is
that
lincoln
plan
as
it
stood
was
backed
up
by
mcclellan
mcclellan
was
perhaps
unduly
anxious
for
buell
to
move
on
eastern
tennessee
because
this
would
have
supported
the
invasion
of
virginia
which
he
himself
was
now
contemplating
and
he
was
probably
forgetful
of
the
west
but
he
was
lincoln
highest
military
adviser
and
his
capacity
was
still
trusted
buell
own
view
was
that
when
he
moved
it
should
be
towards
western
tennessee
he
would
have
had
a
railway
connection
behind
him
all
his
way
and
albert
army
would
have
lain
before
him
he
wished
that
halleck
meanwhile
should
advance
up
the
courses
of
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
eastern
tennessee
he
may
have
thought
would
be
in
the
end
more
effectively
succoured
their
two
armies
would
thus
have
converged
on
johnston
halleck
agreed
with
buell
to
the
extent
of
disagreeing
with
lincoln
and
mcclellan
but
no
further
he
declined
to
move
in
concert
with
buell
frémont
had
disorganised
the
army
of
the
west
and
halleck
till
he
had
repaired
the
mischief
permitted
only
certain
minor
enterprises
under
his
command
each
of
the
three
generals
including
the
who
was
the
government
chief
adviser
was
set
upon
his
own
immediate
purpose
and
indisposed
to
understanding
the
situation
of
the
others
buell
perhaps
the
least
so
each
of
them
had
at
first
a
very
sound
reason
the
unreadiness
of
his
army
for
being
in
no
hurry
to
move
but
then
each
of
them
soon
appeared
to
be
a
slow
or
unenterprising
commander
buell
was
perhaps
unlucky
in
this
for
his
whole
conduct
is
the
subject
of
some
controversy
but
he
did
appear
slow
and
the
two
others
it
is
universally
agreed
really
were
so
as
drew
to
a
close
it
became
urgent
that
something
should
be
done
somewhere
even
if
it
were
not
done
in
the
best
possible
direction
the
political
pressure
upon
the
administration
became
as
great
as
before
bull
run
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
rapidly
become
a
fine
army
and
its
enemy
in
no
way
superior
lay
entrenching
at
manassas
twenty
miles
in
front
of
it
when
lincoln
grew
despondent
and
declared
that
if
something
was
not
done
soon
the
bottom
would
drop
out
of
the
whole
concern
soldiers
remark
that
the
military
situation
was
really
sound
but
he
was
right
for
a
people
can
hardly
be
kept
up
to
the
pitch
of
a
high
enterprise
if
it
is
forced
to
think
that
nothing
will
happen
before
the
end
of
the
year
military
reasons
for
waiting
were
no
longer
being
urged
mcclellan
had
long
been
promising
immediate
action
buell
and
halleck
seemed
merely
unable
to
agree
in
later
days
when
lincoln
had
learnt
much
by
experience
it
is
hard
to
trace
the
signs
of
his
influence
in
military
matters
because
though
he
followed
them
closely
he
was
commonly
in
full
agreement
with
his
chief
general
and
he
invariably
and
rightly
left
him
free
at
this
stage
when
his
position
was
more
difficult
and
his
guidance
came
from
common
sense
and
the
military
books
of
which
ever
since
bull
run
he
had
been
trying
amidst
all
his
work
to
tear
out
the
heart
there
is
evidence
on
which
to
judge
the
intelligence
which
he
applied
to
the
war
certainly
he
now
and
ever
after
looked
at
the
matter
as
a
whole
and
formed
a
clear
view
of
it
which
for
a
civilian
at
any
rate
was
a
reasonable
view
certainly
also
at
this
time
and
for
long
after
no
military
adviser
attempted
in
correcting
any
error
of
his
to
supply
him
with
a
better
opinion
equally
clear
and
comprehensive
this
is
probably
why
some
northern
military
critics
when
they
came
to
read
his
correspondence
with
his
generals
called
him
as
his
chief
biographers
were
tempted
to
think
him
the
ablest
strategist
of
the
war
grant
and
sherman
did
not
say
this
they
said
what
is
another
thing
that
his
was
the
greatest
intellectual
force
that
they
had
met
with
strictly
speaking
he
could
not
be
a
strategist
if
he
were
so
judged
he
would
certainly
be
found
guilty
of
having
till
grant
came
to
washington
unduly
scattered
his
forces
he
could
pick
out
the
main
objects
but
as
to
how
to
economise
effort
what
force
and
how
composed
and
equipped
was
necessary
for
a
particular
enterprise
whether
in
given
conditions
of
roads
weather
supplies
and
previous
fatigue
a
movement
was
practicable
and
how
long
it
would
take
any
clever
subaltern
with
actual
experience
of
campaigning
ought
to
have
been
a
better
judge
than
he
the
test
which
the
reader
must
be
asked
to
apply
to
his
conduct
of
the
war
is
whether
he
followed
duly
or
unduly
his
own
imperfect
judgment
whether
on
the
whole
he
gave
in
whenever
it
was
wise
to
the
generals
under
him
and
whether
he
did
so
without
losing
his
broad
view
or
surrendering
his
ultimate
purpose
it
is
really
no
small
proof
of
strength
that
with
the
definite
judgments
which
he
constantly
formed
he
very
rarely
indeed
gave
imperative
orders
as
which
he
was
to
any
general
the
circumstances
all
of
which
will
soon
appear
in
which
he
was
tempted
or
obliged
to
do
so
are
only
the
few
marked
exceptions
to
his
habitual
conduct
there
are
significant
contrary
instances
in
which
he
abstained
even
from
seeking
to
know
his
general
precise
intentions
at
the
time
which
has
just
been
reviewed
when
the
scheme
of
the
war
was
in
the
making
his
correspondence
with
buell
and
halleck
shows
his
fundamental
intention
he
emphatically
abstains
from
forcing
them
he
lucidly
though
not
so
tactfully
as
later
urges
his
own
view
upon
the
consideration
of
his
general
begging
him
not
necessarily
to
act
upon
it
but
at
least
to
see
the
point
and
if
he
will
not
do
what
is
wished
to
form
and
explain
as
clearly
a
plan
for
doing
something
better
war
in
the
west
up
to
may
the
pressure
upon
mcclellan
to
move
grew
stronger
and
indeed
more
justifiable
month
after
month
and
when
at
last
in
march
mcclellan
did
move
the
story
of
the
severest
adversity
to
the
north
of
lincoln
sorest
trials
and
some
still
say
his
gravest
failures
began
its
details
will
concern
us
more
than
those
of
any
other
part
of
the
war
but
events
in
the
west
began
earlier
proceeded
faster
and
should
be
told
first
buell
could
not
obtain
from
mcclellan
permission
to
carry
out
his
own
scheme
he
did
however
obtain
permission
for
halleck
if
he
consented
to
send
flotillas
up
the
tennessee
and
cumberland
rivers
to
make
a
diversion
while
buell
as
lincoln
had
proposed
and
as
mcclellan
had
now
ordered
marched
upon
eastern
tennessee
halleck
would
not
move
buell
prepared
to
move
alone
and
in
january
sent
forward
a
small
force
under
thomas
to
meet
an
equally
small
confederate
force
that
had
advanced
through
cumberland
gap
into
eastern
kentucky
thomas
won
a
complete
victory
most
welcome
as
the
first
success
since
the
defeat
of
bull
run
at
a
place
called
mill
springs
far
up
the
cumberland
river
towards
the
mountains
but
at
the
end
of
january
while
buell
was
following
up
with
his
forces
rather
widely
dispersed
because
he
expected
no
support
from
halleck
he
was
brought
to
a
stop
for
halleck
without
warning
did
make
an
important
movement
of
his
own
in
which
he
would
need
buell
support
the
cumberland
and
the
tennessee
are
navigable
rivers
which
in
their
lower
course
flow
parallel
in
a
northerly
or
direction
to
join
the
ohio
not
far
above
its
junction
with
the
mississippi
at
cairo
fort
henry
was
a
confederate
fort
guarding
the
navigation
of
the
tennessee
near
the
northern
boundary
of
the
state
of
that
name
fort
donelson
was
another
on
the
cumberland
not
far
off
ulysses
simpson
grant
who
had
served
with
real
distinction
in
the
mexican
war
had
retired
from
the
army
and
had
been
more
or
less
employed
about
his
father
leather
store
in
illinois
and
in
the
gloomy
pursuit
of
intoxication
and
of
raising
small
sums
from
reluctant
friends
when
he
met
them
on
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
he
suddenly
pulled
himself
together
and
with
some
difficulty
got
employment
from
the
governor
of
illinois
as
a
in
the
state
militia
obtaining
army
rank
later
since
then
while
serving
under
halleck
he
had
shown
sense
and
promptitude
in
seizing
an
important
point
on
the
ohio
upon
which
the
confederates
had
designs
he
had
a
quick
eye
for
seeing
important
points
grant
was
now
ordered
or
obtained
permission
from
halleck
to
capture
fort
henry
and
fort
donelson
by
the
sudden
movements
of
grant
and
of
the
flotilla
acting
with
him
the
confederates
were
forced
to
abandon
fort
henry
on
february
ten
days
later
fort
donelson
surrendered
with
nearly
prisoners
after
a
brilliant
and
nearly
successful
sortie
by
the
garrison
in
which
grant
showed
further
tenacity
and
a
collected
mind
under
the
pressure
of
imminent
calamity
halleck
had
given
grant
little
help
buell
was
reluctant
to
detach
any
of
his
volunteer
troops
from
their
comrades
to
act
with
a
strange
army
and
halleck
had
not
warned
him
of
his
intentions
halleck
soon
applied
to
lincoln
for
the
supreme
command
over
the
two
western
armies
with
buell
under
him
this
was
given
to
him
experience
showed
that
one
or
the
other
must
command
now
that
concerted
action
was
necessary
nothing
was
known
at
washington
to
set
against
halleck
own
claim
of
the
credit
for
the
late
successes
so
lincoln
gave
him
the
command
though
present
knowledge
shows
clearly
that
buell
was
the
better
man
grant
had
been
left
before
fort
donelson
in
a
position
of
some
danger
from
the
army
under
albert
johnston
and
from
needless
fear
of
beauregard
with
a
confederate
force
under
him
yet
further
west
halleck
let
slip
the
chance
of
sending
grant
in
pursuit
of
johnston
who
was
falling
back
up
the
cumberland
valley
as
it
was
johnston
for
a
time
evacuated
nashville
further
up
the
cumberland
the
chief
town
of
tennessee
and
a
great
railway
centre
which
buell
promptly
occupied
beauregard
withdrew
the
confederate
troops
from
columbus
a
fortress
of
great
reputed
strength
on
the
mississippi
not
far
below
cairo
to
positions
forty
or
fifty
miles
as
the
crow
flies
further
down
the
stream
thus
as
it
was
some
important
steps
had
been
gained
in
securing
that
control
of
the
navigation
of
the
river
which
was
one
of
the
great
military
objects
of
the
north
furthermore
successful
work
was
being
done
still
further
west
by
general
curtis
in
missouri
who
drove
an
invading
force
back
into
arkansas
and
inflicted
a
crushing
defeat
upon
them
there
in
march
but
a
great
stroke
should
now
have
been
struck
buell
it
is
said
saw
plainly
that
his
forces
and
halleck
should
have
been
concentrated
as
far
up
the
tennessee
as
possible
in
an
endeavour
to
seize
upon
the
main
railway
system
of
the
confederacy
in
the
west
halleck
preferred
it
would
seem
to
concentrate
upon
nothing
and
to
scatter
his
forces
upon
minor
enterprises
provided
he
did
not
risk
any
important
engagement
an
important
engagement
with
the
hope
of
destroying
an
army
of
the
enemy
was
the
very
thing
which
as
johnston
forces
now
stood
he
should
have
sought
but
he
appears
to
have
been
contented
by
the
temporary
retirement
of
an
unscathed
enemy
who
would
return
again
reinforced
buell
was
an
unlucky
man
and
halleck
got
quite
all
he
deserved
so
it
is
possible
that
events
have
been
described
to
us
without
enough
regard
to
halleck
case
as
against
buell
but
at
any
rate
while
much
should
have
been
happening
nothing
very
definite
did
happen
till
april
when
albert
johnston
now
strongly
reinforced
from
the
extreme
south
came
upon
grant
who
it
is
not
clear
why
had
lain
encamped
without
entrenching
and
not
expecting
immediate
attack
near
shiloh
far
up
the
tennessee
river
in
the
extreme
south
of
tennessee
state
buell
at
the
time
though
without
clear
information
as
to
grant
danger
was
on
his
way
to
join
him
there
seems
to
have
been
negligence
both
on
halleck
part
and
on
grant
the
battle
of
shiloh
is
said
to
have
been
highly
characteristic
of
the
combats
of
partly
disciplined
armies
in
which
the
individual
qualities
good
or
bad
of
the
troops
play
a
conspicuous
part
direction
on
the
part
of
johnston
or
grant
was
not
conspicuously
seen
but
the
latter
whose
troops
were
surprised
and
driven
back
some
distance
was
intensely
determined
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
albert
johnston
was
killed
rightly
or
wrongly
jefferson
davis
and
his
other
friends
regarded
his
death
as
the
greatest
of
calamities
to
the
south
after
the
manner
of
many
battles
more
especially
in
this
war
the
battle
of
shiloh
was
the
subject
of
long
subsequent
dispute
between
friends
of
grant
and
of
buell
and
far
more
bitter
dispute
between
friends
of
albert
johnston
and
beauregard
but
it
seems
that
the
south
was
on
the
point
of
winning
till
late
on
the
the
approach
of
the
first
reinforcements
from
buell
made
it
useless
to
attempt
more
by
the
following
morning
further
large
reinforcements
had
come
up
grant
in
his
turn
attacked
and
beauregard
had
difficulty
in
turning
a
precipitate
retirement
into
an
orderly
retreat
upon
corinth
forty
miles
away
a
junction
upon
the
principal
railway
line
to
be
defended
the
next
day
general
pope
who
had
some
time
before
been
detached
by
halleck
for
this
purpose
after
arduous
work
in
canal
cutting
captured
with
prisoners
the
northernmost
forts
held
by
the
confederacy
on
the
mississippi
but
halleck
plans
required
that
his
further
advance
should
be
stopped
halleck
himself
in
his
own
time
arrived
at
the
front
in
his
own
time
after
being
joined
by
pope
he
advanced
carefully
entrenching
himself
every
night
he
covered
in
something
over
a
month
the
forty
miles
route
to
corinth
which
to
his
surprise
was
bloodlessly
evacuated
before
him
he
was
an
engineer
and
like
some
other
engineers
in
the
civil
war
was
overmuch
set
upon
a
methodical
and
cautious
procedure
but
his
mere
advance
to
corinth
caused
the
confederates
to
abandon
yet
another
fort
on
the
mississippi
and
on
june
the
northern
troops
were
able
to
occupy
memphis
for
which
lincoln
had
long
wished
while
the
flotilla
accompanying
them
destroyed
a
confederate
flotilla
meanwhile
on
may
admiral
farragut
daringly
running
up
the
mississippi
had
captured
new
orleans
and
a
northern
force
under
butler
was
able
to
establish
itself
in
louisiana
the
north
had
now
gained
the
command
of
most
of
the
mississippi
for
only
the
hundred
miles
or
so
between
vicksburg
far
south
and
port
hudson
between
that
and
new
orleans
was
still
held
by
the
south
and
command
by
northern
gunboats
of
the
chief
tributaries
of
the
great
river
was
also
established
the
confederate
armies
in
the
west
were
left
intact
though
with
some
severe
losses
and
would
be
able
before
long
to
strike
northward
in
a
direction
for
all
that
these
were
great
and
permanent
gains
yet
the
north
was
not
cheered
the
great
loss
of
life
at
shiloh
the
greatest
battle
in
the
war
so
far
created
a
horrible
impression
halleck
under
whom
all
this
progress
had
been
made
properly
enough
received
a
credit
which
critics
later
have
found
to
be
excessive
though
it
is
plain
that
he
had
reorganised
his
army
well
but
grant
was
felt
to
have
been
caught
napping
at
shiloh
there
were
other
rumours
about
him
too
and
he
fell
deep
into
general
disfavour
the
events
of
the
western
war
did
not
pause
for
long
but
till
the
end
of
this
year
the
north
made
no
further
definite
progress
and
the
south
though
it
was
able
to
invade
the
north
achieved
no
important
result
it
will
be
well
then
here
to
take
up
the
story
of
events
in
the
east
and
to
follow
them
continuously
till
may
when
the
dazzling
fortune
of
the
south
in
that
theatre
if
the
war
reached
its
highest
point
war
in
the
east
up
to
may
the
interest
of
this
part
of
the
civil
war
lies
chiefly
in
the
achievements
of
lee
and
stonewall
jackson
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
north
it
was
not
only
disastrous
but
forms
a
dreary
and
controversial
chapter
george
mcclellan
came
to
washington
amid
overwhelming
demonstrations
of
public
confidence
his
comparative
youth
added
to
the
interest
taken
in
him
and
he
was
spoken
of
as
the
young
napoleon
this
ridiculous
name
for
a
man
already
was
a
sign
that
the
people
expected
impossible
things
from
him
letters
to
his
wife
which
have
been
injudiciously
published
show
him
to
us
delighting
at
first
in
the
consideration
paid
to
him
by
lincoln
and
scott
proudly
confident
in
his
own
powers
rather
elated
than
otherwise
by
a
sense
that
the
safety
of
the
country
rested
on
him
alone
i
shall
carry
the
thing
and
crush
the
rebels
in
one
campaign
he
soon
had
a
magnificent
army
he
may
be
said
to
have
made
it
himself
before
as
he
thought
the
time
had
come
to
use
it
he
had
fallen
from
favour
and
a
dead
set
was
being
made
against
him
in
washington
a
little
later
at
the
crisis
of
his
great
venture
when
as
he
claimed
the
confederate
capital
could
have
been
taken
his
expedition
was
recalled
then
at
a
moment
of
deadly
peril
to
the
country
his
services
were
again
called
in
he
warded
off
the
danger
yet
a
little
while
and
his
services
were
discarded
for
ever
this
summary
which
is
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
truth
must
enlist
a
certain
sympathy
for
him
the
chief
fact
of
his
later
life
should
at
once
be
added
in
when
a
presidential
election
was
approaching
and
despondency
prevailed
widely
in
the
north
he
was
selected
as
the
champion
of
a
great
party
the
democrats
adopted
a
platform
which
expressed
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
desire
to
end
the
war
on
any
terms
in
accordance
with
the
invariable
tradition
of
party
opposition
in
war
time
they
chose
a
war
hero
as
their
candidate
for
the
presidency
mcclellan
publicly
repudiated
their
principles
and
no
doubt
he
meant
it
but
he
became
their
candidate
their
master
or
their
servant
as
it
might
prove
that
he
was
lincoln
opponent
in
the
election
of
that
year
ensured
that
his
merits
and
his
misfortunes
would
be
long
remembered
but
his
action
then
may
suggest
to
any
one
the
doubtful
point
in
his
career
all
along
some
estimate
of
his
curious
yet
by
no
means
uncommon
type
of
character
is
necessary
if
lincoln
relations
with
him
are
to
be
understood
at
all
the
devotion
to
him
shown
by
his
troops
proves
that
he
had
great
titles
to
confidence
besides
what
he
also
had
a
certain
faculty
of
parade
with
his
handsome
charger
his
imposing
staff
and
the
rest
he
was
a
great
trainer
of
soldiers
and
with
some
strange
lapses
a
good
organiser
he
was
careful
for
the
welfare
of
his
men
and
his
almost
tender
carefulness
of
their
lives
contrasted
afterwards
with
what
appeared
the
ruthless
carelessness
of
grant
unlike
some
of
his
successors
he
could
never
be
called
an
incapable
commander
his
great
opponent
lee
who
had
known
him
of
old
was
wont
to
calculate
on
his
extraordinary
want
of
enterprise
but
he
spoke
of
him
on
the
whole
in
terms
of
ample
respect
also
by
the
way
he
sympathised
with
him
like
a
soldier
when
as
he
naturally
assumed
he
became
a
victim
to
scheming
politicians
and
lee
confided
this
feeling
to
the
ready
ears
of
another
great
soldier
wolseley
as
he
showed
himself
in
civil
life
mcclellan
was
an
attractive
gentleman
of
genial
address
it
was
voted
that
he
was
magnetic
and
his
private
life
was
so
entirely
irreproachable
as
to
afford
lively
satisfaction
more
than
this
it
may
be
conjectured
that
to
a
certain
standard
of
honour
loyalty
and
patriotism
which
he
set
consciously
before
himself
he
would
always
have
been
devotedly
true
but
if
it
be
asked
further
whether
mcclellan
was
the
desired
instrument
for
lincoln
and
the
country
needs
and
whether
as
the
saying
is
he
was
a
man
to
go
with
something
very
much
against
him
though
hard
to
define
appears
in
every
part
of
his
record
except
indeed
one
performance
in
his
peninsular
campaign
did
he
ever
do
his
best
to
beat
the
enemy
did
he
ever
except
for
a
moment
concentrate
himself
singly
upon
any
great
object
were
even
his
preparations
thorough
was
his
information
ever
accurate
was
his
purpose
in
the
war
ever
definite
and
if
so
made
plain
to
his
government
was
he
often
betrayed
into
marked
frankness
or
into
marked
generosity
no
one
would
be
ready
to
answer
yes
to
any
of
these
questions
mcclellan
fills
so
memorable
a
place
in
american
history
that
he
demands
such
a
label
as
can
be
given
to
him
in
the
most
moving
and
the
most
authentic
of
all
visions
of
judgment
men
were
not
set
on
the
right
hand
or
the
left
according
as
they
were
of
irreproachable
or
reproachable
character
they
were
divided
into
those
who
did
and
those
who
did
not
in
the
provisional
judgment
which
men
if
they
make
it
modestly
should
at
times
make
with
decision
mcclellan
place
is
clear
the
quality
spiacente
a
dio
ed
ai
nemici
suoi
of
the
men
who
did
not
ran
through
and
through
him
lincoln
required
first
a
general
who
would
make
no
fatal
blunder
but
he
required
too
when
he
could
find
him
a
general
of
undaunted
enterprise
he
did
not
wish
to
expose
the
north
to
disaster
but
he
did
mean
to
conquer
the
south
there
was
some
security
in
employing
mcclellan
though
employing
him
did
at
one
time
throw
on
unfit
shoulders
the
task
of
defending
washington
it
proved
very
hard
to
find
another
general
equally
trustworthy
but
in
the
light
of
facts
which
lincoln
came
to
perceive
it
proved
impossible
to
consider
mcclellan
as
the
man
to
finish
the
war
we
need
only
notice
the
doings
of
the
main
armies
in
this
theatre
of
the
war
and
take
no
account
of
various
minor
affairs
at
outlying
posts
from
the
battle
of
bull
run
which
was
on
july
to
march
the
southern
army
under
joseph
johnston
lay
quietly
drilling
at
manassas
it
of
course
entrenched
its
position
but
to
add
to
the
appearance
of
its
strength
it
constructed
embrasures
for
more
than
its
number
of
guns
and
had
dummy
guns
to
show
in
them
at
one
moment
there
was
a
prospect
that
it
might
move
johnston
and
the
general
with
him
had
no
idea
of
attacking
the
army
of
the
potomac
where
it
lay
but
they
did
think
that
with
a
further
or
they
might
successfully
invade
maryland
crossing
higher
up
the
potomac
and
by
drawing
mcclellan
away
from
his
present
position
get
a
chance
of
defeating
him
the
southern
president
came
to
manassas
at
their
invitation
on
october
but
he
did
not
think
well
to
withdraw
the
trained
men
whom
he
could
have
sent
to
johnston
from
the
various
points
in
the
south
at
which
they
were
stationed
he
may
have
had
good
reasons
but
it
is
likely
that
he
sacrificed
one
of
the
best
chances
of
the
south
mcclellan
army
was
soon
in
as
good
a
state
of
preparation
as
johnston
early
in
october
mcclellan
had
on
his
own
statement
over
men
at
his
disposal
joseph
johnston
on
his
own
statement
under
johnston
was
well
informed
as
to
numbers
very
likely
he
could
get
information
from
maryland
more
easily
than
mcclellan
from
virginia
the
two
armies
lay
not
miles
apart
the
weather
and
the
roads
were
good
to
the
end
of
december
the
roads
were
practicable
by
march
and
they
seem
to
have
been
so
all
the
time
as
spring
approached
it
appeared
to
the
southern
generals
that
mcclellan
must
soon
advance
johnston
thought
that
his
right
flank
was
liable
to
be
turned
and
the
railway
communications
south
of
manassas
liable
to
be
cut
in
the
course
of
february
it
was
realised
that
his
position
was
too
dangerous
the
large
stores
accumulated
there
were
removed
and
when
early
in
march
there
were
reports
of
unusual
activity
in
the
northern
camp
johnston
still
expecting
attack
from
the
same
direction
began
his
retreat
on
march
it
was
learned
in
washington
that
manassas
had
been
completely
evacuated
mcclellan
marched
his
whole
army
there
and
marched
it
back
johnston
withdrew
quietly
behind
the
rapidan
river
some
miles
further
south
and
to
his
surprise
was
left
free
from
any
pursuit
for
months
past
the
incessant
report
in
the
papers
all
quiet
upon
the
potomac
had
been
getting
upon
the
nerves
of
the
north
the
gradual
conversion
of
their
pride
in
an
imposing
army
into
puzzled
rage
at
its
inactivity
has
left
a
deeper
impression
on
northern
memories
than
the
shock
of
disappointment
at
bull
run
public
men
of
weight
had
been
pressing
for
an
advance
in
november
and
when
the
joint
committee
of
congress
an
arbitrary
and
meddlesome
but
able
and
perhaps
on
the
whole
useful
body
was
set
up
in
december
it
brought
its
full
influence
to
bear
on
the
president
lincoln
was
already
anxious
enough
he
wished
to
rouse
mcclellan
himself
to
activity
while
he
screened
him
against
excessive
impatience
or
interference
with
his
plans
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
was
mcclellan
real
mind
quite
early
he
seems
to
have
held
out
hopes
to
lincoln
that
he
would
soon
attack
but
he
was
writing
to
his
wife
that
he
expected
to
be
attacked
by
superior
numbers
it
is
certain
however
that
he
was
possessed
now
and
always
by
a
delusion
as
to
the
enemy
strength
for
instance
lincoln
at
last
felt
bound
to
work
out
for
himself
definite
prospects
for
a
forward
movement
it
is
sufficient
to
say
of
this
layman
effort
that
he
proposed
substantially
the
line
of
advance
which
johnston
a
little
later
began
to
dread
most
lincoln
plan
was
submitted
for
mcclellan
consideration
mcclellan
rejected
it
and
his
reasons
were
based
on
his
assertion
that
he
would
have
to
meet
nearly
equal
numbers
he
in
fact
the
enemy
by
more
than
three
to
one
if
we
find
the
president
later
setting
aside
the
general
judgment
on
grounds
that
are
not
fully
explained
we
must
recall
mcclellan
vast
and
persistent
miscalculations
of
an
enemy
resident
in
his
neighbourhood
and
the
distrust
which
he
thus
created
was
aggravated
by
another
propensity
of
his
vague
mind
his
illusory
fear
was
the
companion
of
an
extravagant
hope
the
confederate
army
was
invincible
when
all
the
world
expected
him
to
attack
it
then
and
there
but
the
blow
which
he
would
deal
it
in
his
own
place
and
his
own
time
was
to
have
decisive
results
which
were
indeed
impossible
the
enemy
was
to
pass
beneath
the
caudine
forks
the
demands
which
he
made
on
the
administration
for
men
and
supplies
seemed
to
have
no
finality
about
them
his
tone
in
regard
to
them
seemed
to
degenerate
into
a
chronic
grumble
the
war
department
certainly
did
not
intend
to
stint
him
in
any
way
but
he
was
an
unsatisfactory
man
to
deal
with
in
these
matters
there
was
a
great
mystery
as
to
what
became
of
the
men
sent
to
him
in
the
idyllic
phrase
which
lincoln
once
used
of
him
or
of
some
other
general
sending
troops
to
him
was
like
shifting
fleas
across
a
barn
floor
with
a
shovel
not
half
of
them
ever
get
there
but
his
fault
was
graver
than
this
utterly
ignoring
the
needs
of
the
west
he
tried
as
to
divert
to
his
own
army
the
recruits
and
the
stores
required
for
the
other
armies
the
difficulty
with
him
went
yet
further
mcclellan
himself
deliberately
set
to
work
to
destroy
personal
harmony
between
himself
and
his
government
it
counts
for
little
that
in
private
he
soon
set
down
all
the
civil
authorities
as
the
greatest
set
of
incapables
and
so
forth
but
it
counts
for
more
that
he
was
personally
insolent
to
the
president
lincoln
had
been
in
the
habit
mistaken
in
this
case
but
natural
in
a
chief
who
desires
to
be
friendly
of
calling
at
mcclellan
house
rather
than
summoning
him
to
his
own
mcclellan
acquired
a
habit
of
avoiding
him
he
treated
his
enquiries
as
idle
curiosity
and
he
probably
thought
not
without
a
grain
of
reason
that
lincoln
way
of
discussing
matters
with
many
people
led
him
into
indiscretion
so
one
evening
when
lincoln
and
seward
were
waiting
at
the
general
house
for
his
return
mcclellan
came
in
and
went
upstairs
a
message
was
sent
that
the
president
would
be
glad
to
see
him
he
said
he
was
tired
and
would
rather
be
excused
that
night
lincoln
damped
down
his
friends
indignation
at
this
he
would
he
once
said
hold
general
mcclellan
stirrup
for
him
if
he
will
only
win
us
victories
but
he
called
no
more
at
mcclellan
and
a
curious
abruptness
in
some
of
his
orders
later
marks
his
unsuccessful
effort
to
deal
with
mcclellan
in
another
way
the
slightly
ridiculous
light
in
which
the
story
shows
lincoln
would
not
obscure
to
any
soldier
the
full
gravity
of
such
an
incident
it
was
not
merely
foolish
to
treat
a
kind
superior
rudely
a
general
who
thus
drew
down
a
curtain
between
his
own
mind
and
that
of
the
government
evidently
went
a
very
long
way
to
ensure
failure
in
war
lincoln
had
failed
to
move
mcclellan
early
in
december
for
part
of
that
month
and
january
mcclellan
was
very
ill
consultations
were
held
with
other
generals
including
mcdowell
who
could
not
be
given
the
chief
command
because
the
troops
did
not
trust
him
mcdowell
and
the
rest
were
in
agreement
with
lincoln
then
mcclellan
suddenly
recovered
and
was
present
at
a
renewed
consultation
he
snubbed
mcdowell
the
inadequacy
of
his
force
to
meet
in
fact
less
than
a
third
of
its
number
was
so
plain
that
a
blind
man
could
see
it
he
was
severely
and
abruptly
tackled
as
to
his
own
plans
by
secretary
chase
lincoln
intervened
to
shield
him
got
from
him
a
distinct
statement
that
he
had
in
his
mind
a
definite
time
for
moving
and
adjourned
the
meeting
stanton
one
of
the
friends
to
whom
mcclellan
had
confided
his
grievances
was
now
at
the
war
department
and
was
at
one
with
the
joint
committee
of
congress
in
his
impatience
that
mcclellan
should
move
at
last
on
january
lincoln
published
a
general
war
order
that
a
forward
movement
was
to
be
made
by
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
the
western
armies
on
february
it
seems
a
blundering
step
but
it
roused
mcclellan
for
a
time
he
even
thought
of
acting
as
lincoln
wished
he
would
move
straight
against
johnston
and
in
ten
days
he
told
chase
on
february
i
shall
be
in
richmond
but
he
quickly
returned
to
the
plan
which
he
seems
to
have
been
forming
before
but
which
he
only
now
revealed
to
the
government
and
it
was
a
plan
which
involved
further
delay
when
february
passed
and
nothing
was
done
the
joint
committee
were
indignant
that
lincoln
still
stood
by
mcclellan
but
mcclellan
now
was
proposing
definite
action
apart
from
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
better
man
there
was
the
fact
that
mcclellan
had
made
his
army
and
was
beloved
by
it
above
all
lincoln
had
not
lost
all
the
belief
he
had
formed
at
first
in
capacity
he
believed
that
if
he
could
once
get
mcclellan
started
he
would
do
well
professional
criticism
alive
to
mcclellan
military
faults
has
justified
lincoln
in
this
and
it
was
for
something
other
than
professional
failure
that
lincoln
at
last
removed
him
mcclellan
had
determined
to
move
his
army
by
sea
to
some
point
further
down
the
coast
of
the
chesapeake
bay
the
questions
which
lincoln
wrote
to
him
requesting
a
written
answer
have
never
been
adequately
answered
did
mcclellan
plan
he
asked
require
less
time
or
money
than
lincoln
did
it
make
victory
more
certain
did
it
make
it
more
valuable
in
case
of
disaster
did
it
make
retreat
more
easy
the
one
point
for
consideration
in
mcclellan
reply
to
him
is
that
the
enemy
did
not
expect
such
a
movement
this
was
quite
true
but
the
enemy
was
able
to
meet
it
and
mcclellan
was
far
too
deliberate
to
reap
any
advantage
from
a
surprise
his
original
plan
was
to
land
near
a
place
called
urbana
on
the
estuary
of
the
rappahannock
not
fifty
miles
east
of
richmond
when
he
heard
that
johnston
had
retreated
further
south
he
assumed
and
ever
after
declared
that
this
was
to
anticipate
his
design
upon
urbana
which
he
said
must
have
reached
the
enemy
ears
through
the
loose
chattering
of
the
administration
as
has
been
seen
this
was
quite
untrue
his
project
of
going
to
urbana
was
now
changed
by
himself
or
the
government
upon
the
unanimous
advice
of
his
chief
subordinate
generals
into
a
movement
to
fort
monroe
which
he
had
even
before
regarded
as
preferable
to
a
direct
advance
southwards
a
few
days
after
johnston
retreat
the
war
department
began
the
embarkation
of
his
troops
for
this
point
fort
monroe
is
at
the
end
of
the
peninsula
which
lies
between
the
estuaries
of
the
york
river
on
the
north
and
the
james
on
the
south
near
the
base
of
this
projection
of
land
miles
from
fort
monroe
stands
richmond
on
april
mcclellan
himself
landed
to
begin
the
celebrated
peninsula
campaign
which
was
to
close
in
disappointment
at
the
end
of
july
before
the
troops
were
sent
to
the
peninsula
several
things
were
to
be
done
an
expedition
to
restore
communication
westward
by
the
baltimore
and
ohio
rail
way
involved
bridging
the
potomac
with
boats
which
were
to
be
brought
by
canal
it
collapsed
because
mcclellan
boats
were
six
inches
too
wide
for
the
canal
locks
then
lincoln
had
insisted
that
the
navigation
of
the
lower
potomac
should
be
made
free
from
the
menace
of
confederate
batteries
which
if
mcclellan
would
have
with
the
navy
department
would
have
been
cleared
away
long
before
this
was
now
done
and
though
a
new
peril
to
the
transportation
of
mcclellan
army
suddenly
and
dramatically
disclosed
itself
it
was
as
suddenly
and
dramatically
removed
in
the
hasty
abandonment
of
norfolk
harbour
on
the
south
of
the
james
estuary
by
the
north
a
screw
steamer
called
the
had
been
partly
burnt
and
scuttled
by
the
north
on
march
she
steamed
out
of
the
harbour
in
sight
of
the
north
the
confederates
had
raised
her
and
converted
her
into
an
ironclad
three
wooden
ships
of
the
north
gave
gallant
but
useless
fight
to
her
and
were
destroyed
that
day
and
the
news
spread
consternation
in
every
northern
port
on
the
very
next
morning
there
came
into
the
mouth
of
the
james
the
rival
product
of
the
northern
navy
department
and
of
the
swedish
engineer
ericsson
invention
she
was
compared
to
a
cheesebox
on
a
raft
she
was
named
the
and
was
the
parent
of
a
type
of
vessel
so
called
which
has
been
heard
of
much
more
recently
the
and
the
forthwith
fought
a
three
hours
duel
then
each
retired
into
harbour
without
fatal
damage
but
the
never
came
out
again
she
was
destroyed
by
the
confederates
when
mcclellan
had
advanced
some
way
up
the
peninsula
and
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
speak
of
the
several
similar
efforts
of
the
south
which
nearly
but
not
quite
achieved
very
important
successes
later
before
and
after
his
arrival
at
the
peninsula
mcclellan
received
several
mortifications
immediately
after
the
humiliation
of
the
enemy
escape
from
manassas
he
was
without
warning
relieved
of
his
command
as
this
would
in
any
case
have
followed
naturally
upon
his
expedition
away
from
washington
it
was
in
public
put
on
that
ground
alone
and
he
took
it
well
he
had
been
urged
to
appoint
corps
commanders
for
so
large
a
force
as
his
could
not
remain
organised
only
in
divisions
he
preferred
to
wait
till
he
had
made
trial
of
the
generals
under
him
lincoln
would
not
have
this
delay
and
appointed
corps
commanders
chosen
by
himself
because
he
believed
them
to
be
fighting
men
the
manner
in
which
these
and
some
other
preparatory
steps
were
taken
were
without
a
doubt
intended
to
make
mcclellan
feel
the
whip
they
mark
a
departure
not
quite
happy
at
first
from
lincoln
formerly
too
gentle
manner
a
worse
shock
to
mcclellan
followed
the
president
had
been
emphatic
in
his
orders
that
a
sufficient
force
should
be
left
to
make
washington
safe
and
supposed
that
he
had
come
to
a
precise
understanding
on
this
point
he
suddenly
discovered
that
mcclellan
who
had
now
left
for
fort
monroe
had
ordered
mcdowell
to
follow
him
with
a
force
so
large
that
it
would
not
leave
the
required
number
behind
lincoln
immediately
ordered
mcdowell
and
his
whole
corps
to
remain
though
he
subsequently
sent
a
part
of
it
to
mcclellan
mcclellan
story
later
gives
reason
for
thinking
that
he
had
intended
no
deception
but
if
so
he
had
expressed
himself
with
unpardonable
vagueness
and
he
had
not
in
fact
left
washington
secure
now
and
throughout
this
campaign
lincoln
took
the
line
that
washington
must
be
kept
safe
safe
in
the
judgment
of
all
the
best
military
authorities
available
mcclellan
progress
up
the
peninsula
was
slow
he
had
not
informed
himself
correctly
as
to
the
geography
he
found
the
enemy
not
so
unprepared
as
he
had
supposed
he
wasted
it
is
agreed
a
month
in
regular
approaches
to
their
fortifications
at
yorktown
when
he
might
have
carried
them
by
assault
he
was
soon
confronted
by
joseph
johnston
and
he
seems
both
to
have
exaggerated
numbers
again
and
to
have
been
unprepared
for
his
movements
the
administration
does
not
seem
to
have
spared
any
effort
to
support
him
in
addition
to
the
troops
he
took
with
him
altogether
were
before
long
despatched
to
him
he
was
operating
in
a
very
difficult
country
but
he
was
opposed
at
first
by
not
half
his
own
number
lincoln
in
friendly
letters
urged
upon
him
that
delay
enabled
the
enemy
to
strengthen
himself
both
in
numbers
and
in
fortifications
the
war
department
did
its
best
for
him
the
whole
of
his
incessant
complaints
on
this
score
are
rendered
unconvincing
by
the
language
of
his
private
letters
about
that
sink
of
iniquity
washington
those
treacherous
hounds
the
civil
authorities
who
were
at
least
honest
and
intelligent
men
and
the
abolitionists
and
other
scoundrels
who
he
supposed
wished
the
destruction
of
his
army
the
criticism
in
congress
of
himself
and
his
generals
was
no
doubt
free
but
so
as
lincoln
reminded
him
was
the
criticism
of
lincoln
himself
justly
or
not
there
were
complaints
of
his
relations
with
corps
commanders
lincoln
gave
no
weight
to
them
but
wrote
him
a
manly
and
a
kindly
warning
the
points
of
controversy
which
mcclellan
bequeathed
to
writers
on
the
civil
war
are
innumerable
but
no
one
can
read
his
correspondence
at
this
stage
without
concluding
that
he
was
almost
impossible
to
deal
with
and
that
the
whole
of
his
evidence
in
his
own
case
was
vitiated
by
a
sheer
hallucination
that
people
wished
him
to
fail
he
had
been
nearly
two
months
in
the
peninsula
when
he
was
attacked
at
a
disadvantage
by
johnston
but
defeated
him
on
may
and
june
in
a
battle
which
gave
confidence
and
prestige
to
the
northern
side
but
which
he
did
not
follow
up
a
part
of
his
army
pursued
the
enemy
to
within
four
miles
of
richmond
and
it
has
been
contended
that
if
he
had
acted
with
energy
he
could
at
this
time
have
taken
that
city
his
delay
to
whatever
it
was
due
gave
the
enemy
time
to
strengthen
himself
greatly
both
in
men
and
in
fortifications
the
capable
johnston
was
severely
wounded
in
the
battle
and
was
replaced
by
the
inspired
lee
according
to
mcclellan
own
account
which
english
writers
have
followed
his
movements
had
been
greatly
embarrassed
by
the
false
hope
given
him
that
mcdowell
was
now
to
march
overland
and
join
him
his
statement
that
he
was
influenced
by
this
is
refuted
by
his
own
letters
at
the
time
mcclellan
however
suffered
a
great
disappointment
the
front
of
washington
was
now
clear
of
the
enemy
and
lincoln
had
determined
to
send
mcdowell
when
he
was
induced
to
keep
him
back
by
a
diversion
in
the
war
which
he
had
not
expected
and
which
indeed
mcclellan
had
advised
him
not
to
expect
stonewall
jackson
most
famous
campaign
happened
at
this
juncture
and
to
save
washington
lincoln
and
stanton
placed
themselves
or
were
placed
in
the
trying
position
of
actually
directing
movements
of
troops
there
were
to
the
south
and
of
washington
besides
the
troops
under
mcdowell
command
two
northern
forces
respectively
commanded
by
generals
banks
and
frémont
these
two
men
were
among
the
chief
examples
of
those
political
generals
the
use
of
whom
in
this
early
and
necessarily
blundering
stage
of
the
war
has
been
the
subject
of
much
comment
banks
was
certainly
a
politician
a
man
who
had
worked
in
a
factory
and
who
had
risen
to
be
at
one
time
speaker
of
the
house
he
was
now
a
general
because
as
a
powerful
man
in
the
patriotic
state
of
massachusetts
he
brought
with
him
many
men
and
these
were
ready
to
obey
him
on
the
other
hand
he
on
several
occasions
showed
good
judgment
both
in
military
matters
and
in
the
questions
of
civil
administration
which
came
under
him
his
heart
was
in
his
duty
and
though
he
held
high
commands
almost
to
the
end
of
the
war
want
of
competence
was
never
imputed
to
him
till
the
failure
of
a
very
difficult
enterprise
on
which
he
was
despatched
in
he
was
now
in
the
lower
valley
of
the
shenandoah
keeping
a
watch
over
a
much
smaller
force
under
jackson
higher
up
the
valley
frémont
was
in
some
sense
a
soldier
but
after
his
record
in
missouri
he
should
never
have
been
employed
his
new
appointment
was
one
of
lincoln
greatest
mistakes
and
it
was
a
mistake
of
a
characteristic
kind
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
there
were
real
political
reasons
for
not
leaving
this
popular
champion
of
freedom
unused
and
unrecognized
these
reasons
should
not
have
and
probably
would
not
have
prevailed
but
lincoln
personal
reluctance
to
resist
all
entreaties
on
behalf
of
his
own
forerunner
and
his
own
rival
was
great
and
then
frémont
came
to
lincoln
and
proposed
to
him
a
adventure
to
succour
the
oppressed
unionists
of
tennessee
by
an
expedition
through
west
virginia
so
he
was
now
to
proceed
there
but
was
kept
for
the
present
in
the
mountains
near
the
shenandoah
valley
the
way
in
which
the
forces
under
mcdowell
banks
and
frémont
were
scattered
on
various
errands
was
unscientific
what
could
be
done
by
jackson
in
correspondence
with
lee
was
certainly
unforeseen
at
the
beginning
of
may
jackson
who
earlier
in
the
spring
had
achieved
some
minor
successes
in
the
shenandoah
valley
and
had
raided
west
virginia
began
a
series
of
movements
of
which
the
brilliant
skill
and
daring
are
recorded
in
colonel
henderson
famous
book
with
a
small
force
surrounded
by
other
forces
each
of
which
if
concentrated
should
have
outnumbered
him
he
caught
each
in
turn
at
a
disadvantage
inflicted
on
them
several
damaging
blows
and
put
the
startled
president
and
secretary
of
war
in
fear
for
the
safety
of
washington
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
available
who
could
immediately
be
charged
with
the
supreme
command
of
these
three
northern
forces
unless
mcdowell
could
have
been
spared
from
where
he
was
so
lincoln
with
stanton
help
took
upon
himself
to
ensure
the
of
their
three
commanders
by
orders
from
washington
his
had
now
begun
to
reach
its
full
stature
his
military
good
sense
in
comparison
with
mcclellan
was
proving
greater
than
he
had
supposed
and
he
had
probably
not
discovered
its
limitations
presumably
his
plans
now
were
like
an
amateur
too
complicated
and
it
is
not
worth
while
to
discuss
them
but
he
was
trying
to
cope
with
newly
revealed
military
genius
and
so
far
as
can
be
told
he
was
only
prevented
from
crushing
the
adventurous
jackson
by
a
piece
of
flat
disobedience
on
the
part
of
frémont
frémont
having
thus
appropriately
punished
lincoln
was
removed
this
time
finally
from
command
jackson
having
successfully
kept
mcdowell
from
mcclellan
had
before
the
end
of
june
escaped
safe
southward
mcclellan
was
nearing
richmond
lee
by
this
time
had
been
set
free
from
jefferson
davis
office
and
had
taken
over
the
command
of
joseph
johnston
army
lincoln
must
have
learnt
a
great
deal
and
he
fully
realised
that
the
forces
not
under
mcclellan
in
the
east
should
be
under
some
single
commander
pope
an
experienced
soldier
had
succeeded
well
in
the
west
he
was
no
longer
necessary
there
and
there
was
no
adverse
criticism
upon
him
he
was
in
all
respects
a
proper
choice
and
he
was
now
summoned
to
take
command
of
what
was
to
be
called
the
army
of
virginia
a
few
days
later
upon
the
advice
as
it
seems
of
scott
halleck
himself
was
called
from
the
west
his
old
command
was
left
to
grant
and
he
himself
was
made
and
continued
at
washington
to
the
end
of
the
war
as
an
adviser
of
the
government
all
the
progress
in
the
west
had
been
made
under
supervision
and
his
despatches
had
given
an
exaggerated
impression
of
his
own
achievement
at
corinth
he
had
not
seen
active
service
before
the
war
but
he
had
a
great
name
as
an
accomplished
military
writer
in
after
years
he
was
well
known
as
a
writer
on
international
law
he
is
not
thought
to
have
justified
his
appointment
by
showing
sound
judgment
about
war
and
lincoln
upon
some
later
emergency
told
him
in
his
direct
way
that
his
military
knowledge
was
useless
if
he
could
not
give
a
definite
decision
in
doubtful
circumstances
but
whether
abilities
were
great
or
small
lincoln
continued
to
use
them
because
he
found
him
wholly
for
the
service
without
personal
favour
or
prejudice
mcclellan
was
slowly
but
steadily
nearing
richmond
from
june
to
july
there
took
place
a
series
of
engagements
between
lee
and
mcclellan
or
rather
the
commanders
under
him
known
as
the
seven
battles
the
fortunes
of
the
fighting
varied
greatly
but
the
upshot
is
that
though
the
corps
on
mcclellan
left
won
a
strong
position
not
far
from
richmond
the
sudden
approach
of
jackson
forces
upon
mcclellan
right
flank
which
began
on
the
placed
him
in
what
appears
to
have
been
as
he
himself
thought
it
a
situation
of
great
danger
lee
is
said
to
have
read
mcclellan
like
an
open
book
playing
upon
his
caution
which
made
him
while
his
subordinates
fought
more
anxious
to
secure
their
retreat
than
to
seize
upon
any
advantage
they
gained
but
lee
reading
deceived
him
in
one
respect
he
had
counted
upon
mcclellan
retreating
but
thought
he
would
retreat
under
difficulties
right
down
the
peninsula
to
his
original
base
and
be
thoroughly
cut
up
on
the
way
but
on
july
mcclellan
with
great
skill
withdrew
his
whole
army
to
harrison
landing
far
up
the
james
estuary
having
effected
with
the
navy
a
complete
transference
of
his
base
here
his
army
lay
in
a
position
of
security
they
might
yet
threaten
richmond
and
mcclellan
soldiers
still
believed
in
him
but
the
south
was
led
by
a
great
commander
and
had
now
learned
to
give
him
unbounded
confidence
there
was
some
excuse
for
a
panic
in
wall
street
and
every
reason
for
dejection
in
the
north
on
the
third
of
the
seven
days
mcclellan
much
moved
by
the
sight
of
dead
and
wounded
comrades
sent
a
gloomy
telegram
to
the
secretary
of
war
appealing
with
excessive
eloquence
for
more
men
i
only
wish
to
say
to
the
president
he
remarked
in
it
that
i
think
he
is
wrong
in
regarding
me
as
ungenerous
when
i
said
that
my
force
was
too
weak
he
concluded
if
i
save
the
army
now
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
owe
no
thanks
to
you
nor
to
any
other
persons
in
washington
you
have
done
your
best
to
sacrifice
this
army
stanton
still
expressed
the
extraordinary
hope
that
richmond
would
fall
in
a
day
or
two
he
had
lately
committed
the
folly
of
suspending
enlistment
an
act
which
though
of
course
there
is
an
explanation
of
it
must
rank
as
the
one
blunder
of
lincoln
administration
he
was
now
negotiating
through
the
astute
seward
for
offers
from
the
state
governors
of
a
levy
of
men
to
follow
up
mcclellan
success
lincoln
as
was
his
way
feared
the
worst
he
seems
at
one
moment
to
have
had
fears
for
mcclellan
sanity
but
he
telegraphed
himself
an
answer
to
him
which
affords
as
fair
an
example
as
can
be
given
of
his
characteristic
manner
save
your
army
at
all
events
will
send
reinforcements
as
fast
as
we
can
of
course
they
can
not
reach
you
or
or
next
day
i
have
not
said
you
were
ungenerous
for
saying
you
needed
reinforcements
i
thought
you
were
ungenerous
in
assuming
that
i
did
not
send
them
as
fast
as
i
could
i
feel
any
misfortune
to
you
and
your
army
quite
as
keenly
as
you
feel
it
yourself
if
you
have
had
a
drawn
battle
or
repulse
it
is
the
price
we
pay
for
the
enemy
not
being
in
washington
we
protected
washington
and
the
enemy
concentrated
on
you
had
we
stripped
washington
he
would
have
been
upon
us
before
the
troops
could
have
gotten
to
you
less
than
a
week
ago
you
notified
us
reinforcements
were
leaving
richmond
to
come
in
front
of
us
it
is
the
nature
of
the
case
and
neither
you
nor
the
government
are
to
blame
please
tell
me
at
once
the
present
condition
and
aspect
of
things
demands
for
an
impossible
number
of
reinforcements
continued
lincoln
explained
to
mcclellan
a
few
days
later
that
they
were
impossible
and
added
if
in
your
frequent
mention
of
responsibility
you
have
the
impression
that
i
blame
you
for
not
doing
more
than
you
can
please
be
relieved
of
such
an
impression
i
only
beg
that
in
like
manner
you
will
not
ask
impossibilities
of
me
much
argument
upon
lincoln
next
important
act
may
be
saved
by
the
simple
observations
that
the
problem
in
regard
to
the
defence
of
washington
was
real
that
propensity
to
ask
for
the
impossible
was
also
real
and
that
patient
and
loyal
attitude
to
him
was
real
too
five
days
after
his
arrival
at
harrison
landing
mcclellan
wrote
lincoln
a
long
letter
it
was
a
treatise
upon
lincoln
political
duties
it
was
written
as
on
the
brink
of
eternity
he
was
not
then
in
fact
in
any
danger
and
possibly
he
had
composed
it
seven
days
before
as
his
political
testament
and
apprehensions
free
from
personal
fear
excuse
without
quite
redeeming
its
inappropriateness
the
president
is
before
all
things
not
to
abandon
the
cause
but
the
cause
should
be
fought
for
upon
christian
principles
christian
principles
exclude
warfare
on
private
property
more
especially
do
they
exclude
measures
for
emancipating
slaves
and
if
the
president
gives
way
to
radical
views
on
slavery
he
will
get
no
soldiers
then
follows
a
mandate
to
the
president
to
appoint
a
not
necessarily
the
writer
such
a
summary
does
injustice
to
a
certain
elevation
of
tone
in
the
letter
but
that
elevation
is
itself
slightly
strained
mcclellan
whatever
his
private
opinions
had
not
meddled
with
politics
before
he
left
washington
the
question
why
in
this
military
crisis
he
should
have
written
what
a
democratic
politician
might
have
composed
as
a
party
manifesto
must
later
have
caused
lincoln
some
thought
but
it
apparently
did
not
enter
into
the
decision
he
next
took
he
arrived
himself
at
harrison
landing
next
day
mcclellan
handed
him
the
letter
lincoln
read
it
and
said
that
he
was
obliged
to
him
mcclellan
sent
a
copy
to
his
wife
as
a
very
important
record
lincoln
had
come
in
order
to
learn
the
views
of
mcclellan
and
all
his
corps
commanders
they
differed
a
good
deal
on
important
points
but
a
majority
of
them
were
naturally
anxious
to
stay
and
fight
there
lincoln
was
left
in
some
anxiety
as
to
how
the
health
of
the
troops
would
stand
the
climate
of
the
coming
months
if
they
had
to
wait
long
where
they
were
he
was
also
disturbed
by
mcclellan
vagueness
about
the
number
of
his
men
for
he
now
returned
as
present
for
duty
a
number
which
far
exceeded
that
which
some
of
his
recent
telegrams
had
given
and
yet
fell
short
of
the
number
sent
him
by
an
amount
which
no
reasonable
estimate
of
killed
wounded
and
sick
could
explain
this
added
to
lincoln
doubt
on
the
main
question
presented
to
him
mcclellan
believed
that
he
could
take
richmond
but
he
demanded
for
this
very
large
reinforcements
some
part
of
them
were
already
being
collected
but
the
rest
could
by
no
means
be
given
him
without
leaving
washington
with
far
fewer
troops
to
defend
it
than
mcclellan
or
anybody
else
had
hitherto
thought
necessary
on
july
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
washington
halleck
was
sent
to
consult
with
mcclellan
and
his
generals
the
record
of
their
consultations
sufficiently
shows
the
intricacy
of
the
problem
to
be
decided
the
question
of
the
health
of
the
climate
in
august
weighed
much
with
halleck
but
the
most
striking
feature
of
their
conversation
was
the
fluctuation
of
mcclellan
own
opinion
upon
each
important
point
at
one
moment
he
even
gave
halleck
the
impression
that
he
wished
under
all
the
circumstances
to
withdraw
and
to
join
pope
when
halleck
returned
to
washington
mcclellan
telegraphed
in
passionate
anxiety
to
be
left
in
the
peninsula
and
reinforced
on
the
other
hand
some
of
the
officers
of
highest
rank
with
him
wrote
strongly
urging
withdrawal
this
latter
was
the
course
on
which
lincoln
and
halleck
decided
in
the
circumstances
it
was
certainly
the
simplest
course
to
concentrate
all
available
forces
in
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
from
the
direction
of
washington
which
would
keep
that
capital
covered
all
the
while
it
was
in
any
case
no
hasty
and
no
indefensible
decision
nor
is
there
any
justification
for
the
frequent
assertion
that
some
malignant
influence
brought
it
about
it
is
one
of
the
steps
taken
by
lincoln
which
have
been
the
most
often
lamented
but
if
mcclellan
had
had
all
he
demanded
to
take
richmond
and
had
made
good
his
promise
what
would
lee
have
done
lee
own
answer
to
a
similar
question
later
was
we
would
swap
queens
that
is
he
would
have
taken
washington
if
so
the
confederacy
would
not
have
fallen
but
in
all
probability
the
north
would
have
collapsed
and
european
powers
would
at
the
least
have
recognised
the
confederacy
lincoln
indeed
had
acted
as
any
prudent
civilian
minister
would
then
have
acted
but
disaster
followed
or
rather
there
followed
with
brief
interruption
a
succession
of
disasters
which
after
this
long
tale
of
hesitation
can
be
quickly
told
it
would
be
easy
to
represent
them
as
a
judgment
upon
the
administration
which
had
rejected
the
guidance
of
mcclellan
but
in
the
true
perspective
of
the
war
the
point
which
has
now
been
reached
marks
the
final
election
by
the
north
of
the
policy
by
which
it
won
the
war
mcclellan
even
if
he
had
taken
richmond
while
washington
remained
safe
would
have
concentrated
the
efforts
of
the
north
upon
a
line
of
advance
which
gave
little
promise
of
finally
reducing
the
confederacy
it
is
evident
that
the
right
course
for
the
north
was
to
keep
the
threatening
of
richmond
and
the
recurrent
hammering
at
the
southern
forces
on
that
front
duly
related
to
that
continual
process
by
which
the
vitals
of
the
southern
country
were
being
eaten
into
from
the
west
this
policy
it
has
been
seen
was
present
to
lincoln
mind
from
an
early
day
the
temptation
to
depart
from
it
was
now
once
for
all
rejected
on
the
other
hand
the
three
great
southern
victories
the
second
battle
of
bull
run
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
which
followed
within
the
next
nine
months
had
no
lasting
influence
jefferson
davis
might
perhaps
have
done
well
if
he
had
neglected
all
else
and
massed
every
man
he
could
gather
to
pursue
the
advantage
which
these
battles
gave
him
he
did
not
perhaps
could
not
do
this
but
he
concentrated
his
greatest
resource
of
all
the
genius
of
lee
upon
a
point
at
which
the
real
danger
did
not
lie
pope
had
now
set
vigorously
to
work
collecting
and
pulling
together
his
forces
which
had
previously
been
scattered
under
different
commanders
in
the
north
of
virginia
he
was
guilty
of
a
general
order
which
shocked
people
by
its
boastfulness
insulted
the
eastern
soldiers
by
a
comparison
with
their
western
comrades
and
threatened
harsh
and
most
unjust
treatment
of
the
civil
population
of
virginia
but
upon
the
whole
he
created
confidence
for
he
was
an
officer
well
trained
in
his
profession
as
well
as
an
energetic
man
the
problem
was
now
to
effect
as
quickly
as
possible
the
union
of
pope
troops
and
mcclellan
in
an
overwhelming
force
pope
was
anxious
to
keep
mcclellan
unmolested
while
he
embarked
his
men
so
to
occupy
the
enemy
he
pushed
boldly
into
virginia
he
pushed
too
far
placed
himself
in
great
danger
from
the
lightning
movements
which
lee
now
habitually
employed
jackson
to
execute
but
extricated
himself
with
much
promptitude
though
with
some
considerable
losses
mcclellan
had
not
been
deprived
of
command
he
was
in
the
curious
and
annoying
position
of
having
to
transfer
troops
to
pope
till
for
a
moment
not
a
man
remained
under
him
but
the
process
of
embarking
and
transferring
them
gave
full
scope
for
energy
and
skill
mcclellan
as
it
appeared
to
lincoln
performed
his
task
very
slowly
this
was
not
the
judgment
of
impatience
for
mcclellan
caused
the
delay
by
repeated
and
perverse
disobedience
to
orders
but
the
day
drew
near
when
men
might
be
concentrated
under
pope
against
lee
the
stroke
which
lee
now
struck
after
earnest
consultation
with
jackson
has
been
said
to
have
been
perhaps
the
most
daring
in
the
history
of
warfare
he
divided
his
army
almost
under
the
enemy
eyes
and
sent
jackson
by
a
circuitous
route
to
cut
pope
communications
with
washington
then
followed
an
intricate
tactical
game
in
which
each
side
was
bewildered
as
to
the
movements
of
the
other
pope
became
exasperated
and
abandoned
his
prudence
he
turned
on
his
enemy
when
he
should
and
could
have
withdrawn
to
a
safe
position
and
waited
on
august
and
in
the
ominous
neighbourhood
of
the
bull
run
and
of
manassas
he
sustained
a
heavy
defeat
then
he
abandoned
hope
before
he
need
have
done
so
and
alleging
that
his
men
were
demoralised
begged
to
be
withdrawn
within
the
defences
of
washington
where
he
arrived
on
september
and
as
was
inevitable
in
the
condition
of
his
army
was
relieved
of
his
command
mcclellan
in
lincoln
opinion
had
now
been
guilty
of
the
offence
which
that
generous
mind
would
find
it
hardest
to
forgive
he
had
not
bestirred
himself
to
get
his
men
to
pope
in
lincoln
belief
at
the
time
he
had
wished
pope
to
fail
mcclellan
who
reached
washington
at
the
crisis
of
pope
difficulties
was
consulted
and
said
to
lincoln
that
pope
must
be
left
to
get
out
of
his
scrape
as
best
he
could
it
was
perhaps
only
an
awkward
phrase
but
it
did
not
soften
lincoln
washington
was
now
too
strongly
held
to
be
attacked
but
lee
determined
to
invade
maryland
at
least
this
would
keep
virginia
safe
during
harvest
time
it
might
win
him
many
recruits
in
maryland
it
would
frighten
the
north
all
the
more
because
a
confederate
force
further
west
was
at
that
same
time
invading
kentucky
it
might
accomplish
there
was
no
saying
how
much
this
much
one
may
gather
from
the
life
of
lord
john
russell
any
great
victory
of
the
south
on
northern
soil
would
probably
have
accomplished
the
confederacy
would
have
been
recognised
as
jefferson
davis
longed
for
it
to
be
by
european
powers
lincoln
now
acted
in
total
disregard
of
his
cabinet
and
of
all
washington
and
in
equal
disregard
of
any
false
notions
of
dignity
by
word
of
mouth
he
directed
mcclellan
to
take
command
of
all
the
troops
at
washington
his
opinion
of
mcclellan
had
not
altered
but
as
he
said
to
his
private
secretaries
if
mcclellan
could
not
fight
himself
he
excelled
in
making
others
ready
to
fight
no
other
step
could
have
succeeded
so
quickly
in
restoring
order
and
confidence
to
the
army
few
or
no
instructions
were
given
to
mcclellan
he
was
simply
allowed
the
freest
possible
hand
and
was
watched
with
keen
solicitude
as
to
how
he
would
rise
to
his
opportunity
lee
in
his
advance
expected
his
opponent
to
be
slow
he
actually
again
divided
his
small
army
leaving
jackson
with
a
part
of
it
behind
for
a
while
to
capture
as
he
did
the
northern
fort
at
harper
ferry
a
northern
private
picked
up
a
packet
of
cigars
dropped
by
some
southern
officer
with
a
piece
of
paper
round
it
the
paper
was
a
copy
of
an
order
of
lee
which
revealed
to
mcclellan
the
opportunity
now
given
him
of
crushing
lee
in
detail
but
he
did
not
rouse
himself
he
was
somewhat
hampered
by
lack
of
cavalry
and
his
greatest
quality
in
the
field
was
his
care
not
to
give
chances
to
the
enemy
his
want
of
energy
allowed
lee
time
to
discover
what
had
happened
and
fall
back
a
little
towards
harper
ferry
yet
lee
dared
without
having
yet
reunited
his
forces
to
stop
at
a
point
where
mcclellan
must
be
tempted
to
give
him
battle
and
where
if
he
could
only
stand
against
mcclellan
jackson
would
be
in
a
position
to
deliver
a
deadly
lee
knew
that
for
the
south
the
chance
of
rapid
success
was
worth
any
risk
mcclellan
however
moved
so
slowly
that
jackson
was
able
to
join
lee
before
the
battle
the
northern
army
came
up
with
them
near
the
north
bank
of
the
potomac
on
the
antietam
creek
a
small
tributary
of
that
river
about
sixty
miles
of
washington
there
on
september
mcclellan
ordered
an
attack
to
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
give
his
personal
direction
his
corps
commanders
led
assaults
on
lee
position
at
different
times
and
in
so
disconnected
a
manner
that
each
was
repulsed
singly
but
on
the
following
morning
lee
found
himself
in
a
situation
which
determined
him
to
retreat
as
a
military
success
the
battle
of
antietam
demanded
to
be
followed
up
reinforcements
had
now
come
to
mcclellan
and
lincoln
telegraphed
please
do
not
let
him
get
off
without
being
hurt
lee
was
between
the
broad
potomac
and
a
northern
army
fully
twice
as
large
as
his
own
with
other
large
forces
near
mcclellan
subordinates
urged
him
to
renew
the
attack
and
drive
lee
into
the
river
but
lee
was
allowed
to
cross
the
river
and
mcclellan
lay
camped
on
the
antietam
battlefield
for
a
fortnight
he
may
have
been
dissatisfied
with
the
condition
of
his
army
and
its
supplies
some
of
his
men
wanted
new
boots
many
of
lee
were
limping
barefoot
he
certainly
as
often
before
exaggerated
the
strength
of
his
enemy
lee
recrossed
the
potomac
little
damaged
lincoln
occupied
in
those
days
over
the
most
momentous
act
of
his
political
life
watched
mcclellan
eagerly
and
came
to
the
antietam
to
see
things
for
himself
he
came
back
in
the
full
belief
that
mcclellan
would
move
at
once
once
more
undeceived
he
pressed
him
with
letters
and
telegrams
from
himself
and
halleck
he
was
convinced
that
mcclellan
if
he
tried
could
cut
off
lee
from
richmond
hearing
of
the
fatigue
of
mcclellan
horses
he
telegraphed
about
the
middle
of
october
will
you
pardon
me
for
asking
what
your
horses
have
done
since
the
battle
of
antietam
that
tires
anything
this
was
unkind
mcclellan
indeed
should
have
seen
about
cavalry
in
the
days
when
he
was
organising
in
washington
but
at
this
moment
the
southern
horse
had
just
raided
right
round
his
lines
and
got
safe
back
and
his
own
much
inferior
cavalry
was
probably
worn
out
with
vain
pursuit
of
them
on
the
same
day
lincoln
wrote
more
kindly
my
dear
sir
you
remember
my
speaking
to
you
of
what
i
called
your
are
you
not
when
you
assume
that
you
can
not
do
what
the
enemy
is
constantly
doing
change
positions
with
the
enemy
and
think
you
not
he
would
break
your
communications
with
richmond
within
the
next
hours
and
after
a
brief
analysis
of
the
situation
which
seems
conclusive
he
ends
i
say
if
we
never
try
we
shall
never
succeed
if
we
can
not
beat
him
now
when
he
bears
the
wastage
of
coming
to
us
we
never
can
when
we
bear
the
wastage
of
going
to
him
his
patience
was
nearing
a
limit
which
he
had
already
fixed
in
his
own
mind
on
october
more
than
five
weeks
after
the
battle
mcclellan
began
to
cross
the
potomac
and
took
a
week
in
the
process
on
november
mcclellan
was
removed
from
his
command
and
general
burnside
appointed
in
his
place
lincoln
had
longed
for
the
clear
victory
that
he
thought
mcclellan
would
win
he
gloomily
foreboded
that
he
might
not
find
a
better
man
to
put
in
his
place
he
felt
sadly
how
he
would
be
accused
as
he
has
been
ever
since
of
displacing
mcclellan
because
he
was
a
democrat
in
considering
military
merit
he
wrote
privately
the
world
has
abundant
evidence
that
i
disregard
politics
a
friend
a
republican
general
wrote
to
him
a
week
or
so
after
mcclellan
had
been
removed
to
urge
that
all
the
generals
ought
to
be
men
in
thorough
sympathy
with
the
administration
he
received
a
crushing
reply
to
be
followed
in
a
day
or
two
by
a
friendly
invitation
indignantly
proving
that
democrats
served
as
well
in
the
field
as
republicans
but
in
regard
to
mcclellan
himself
we
now
know
that
a
grave
suspicion
had
entered
lincoln
mind
he
might
perhaps
in
the
fear
of
finding
no
one
better
have
tolerated
his
he
did
not
care
what
line
an
officer
who
did
his
duty
might
in
civil
life
take
politically
but
he
would
not
take
the
risk
of
entrusting
the
war
further
to
a
general
who
let
his
politics
govern
his
strategy
and
who
as
he
put
it
simply
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
enemy
this
he
had
begun
to
believe
was
the
cause
of
mcclellan
lack
of
energy
he
resolved
to
treat
conduct
now
in
fighting
lee
or
in
letting
him
escape
south
as
the
test
of
whether
his
own
suspicion
about
him
was
justified
or
not
lee
did
get
clear
away
and
lincoln
dismissed
mcclellan
in
the
full
belief
right
or
wrong
that
he
was
not
sorry
for
lee
escape
it
is
not
known
exactly
what
further
evidence
lincoln
then
had
for
his
belief
but
information
which
seems
to
have
come
later
made
him
think
afterwards
that
he
had
been
right
the
following
story
was
told
him
by
the
governor
of
vermont
whose
brother
a
certain
general
smith
served
under
mcclellan
and
was
long
his
intimate
friend
lincoln
believed
the
story
so
may
we
the
mayor
of
new
york
a
shifty
demagogue
named
fernando
wood
had
visited
mcclellan
in
the
peninsula
with
a
proposal
that
he
should
become
the
democratic
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
with
a
view
to
this
should
pledge
himself
to
certain
democratic
politicians
to
conduct
the
war
in
a
way
that
should
conciliate
the
south
which
to
lincoln
mind
meant
an
inefficient
way
mcclellan
after
some
days
of
unusual
reserve
told
smith
of
this
and
showed
him
a
letter
which
he
had
drafted
giving
the
desired
pledge
on
earnest
remonstrance
that
this
looked
like
treason
he
did
not
send
the
letter
then
but
wood
came
again
after
the
battle
of
antietam
and
this
time
mcclellan
sent
a
letter
in
the
same
sense
this
he
afterwards
confessed
to
smith
showing
him
a
copy
of
the
letter
smith
and
other
generals
asked
after
this
to
be
relieved
from
service
under
him
if
as
can
hardly
be
doubted
mcclellan
did
this
there
can
be
no
serious
excuse
for
him
and
no
serious
question
that
lincoln
was
right
when
he
concluded
it
was
unsafe
to
employ
him
mcclellan
according
to
all
evidence
except
his
own
letters
was
a
nice
man
and
was
not
likely
to
harbour
a
thought
of
what
to
him
seemed
treason
it
is
honourable
to
him
that
he
wished
later
to
serve
under
grant
but
was
refused
by
him
but
to
one
of
his
views
the
political
situation
before
and
after
antietam
was
alarming
and
it
is
certain
that
to
his
inconclusive
mind
and
character
an
attitude
of
half
loyalty
would
be
easy
he
may
not
have
wished
that
lee
should
escape
but
he
had
no
ardent
desire
that
he
should
not
right
or
wrong
such
was
the
ground
of
independent
and
conscientiously
deliberate
decision
the
result
again
did
not
reward
him
his
choice
of
burnside
was
a
mistake
there
were
corps
commanders
under
mcclellan
who
had
earned
special
confidence
but
they
were
all
rather
old
general
burnside
who
was
the
senior
among
the
rest
had
lately
succeeded
in
operations
in
connection
with
the
navy
on
the
north
carolina
coast
whereby
certain
harbours
were
permanently
closed
to
the
south
he
had
since
served
under
mcclellan
at
the
antietam
but
had
not
earned
much
credit
he
was
a
loyal
friend
to
mcclellan
and
very
modest
about
his
own
capacity
perhaps
both
these
things
prejudiced
lincoln
in
his
favour
he
continued
in
active
service
till
nearly
the
end
of
the
war
when
a
failure
led
to
his
retirement
and
he
was
always
popular
and
respected
at
this
juncture
he
failed
disastrously
on
december
and
lee
army
lay
strongly
posted
on
the
south
of
the
rappahannock
burnside
in
spite
as
it
appears
of
express
warnings
from
lincoln
attacked
lee
at
precisely
the
point
near
the
town
of
fredericksburg
where
his
position
was
really
impregnable
the
defeat
of
the
northern
army
was
bloody
and
overwhelming
burnside
army
became
all
but
mutinous
his
corps
commanders
especially
general
hooker
were
loud
in
complaint
he
was
tempted
to
persist
in
spite
of
all
protests
in
some
further
effort
of
rashness
lincoln
endeavoured
to
restrain
him
halleck
whom
lincoln
begged
to
give
a
definite
military
opinion
upholding
or
overriding
burnside
had
nothing
more
useful
to
offer
than
his
own
resignation
after
discussions
and
recriminations
among
all
officers
concerned
burnside
offered
his
resignation
lincoln
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
remove
a
general
upon
a
first
failure
or
to
side
with
his
subordinates
against
him
and
refused
to
accept
it
burnside
then
offered
the
impossible
alternative
of
the
dismissal
of
all
his
corps
commanders
for
disaffection
to
him
and
on
january
his
resignation
was
accepted
there
was
much
discussion
in
the
cabinet
as
to
the
choice
of
his
successor
it
was
thought
unwise
to
give
the
eastern
army
a
commander
from
the
west
again
at
chase
instance
transcriber
note
insistance
the
senior
corps
commander
who
was
not
too
old
general
hooker
sometimes
called
fighting
joe
hooker
was
appointed
he
received
a
letter
often
quoted
as
the
letter
of
a
man
much
altered
from
the
lincoln
who
had
been
groping
a
year
earlier
after
the
right
way
of
treating
mcclellan
i
have
placed
you
wrote
lincoln
at
the
head
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
of
course
i
have
done
this
upon
what
appear
to
me
to
be
sufficient
reasons
and
yet
i
think
it
best
for
you
to
know
that
there
are
some
things
in
regard
to
which
i
am
not
quite
satisfied
with
you
i
believe
you
to
be
a
brave
and
skilful
soldier
which
of
course
i
like
i
also
believe
that
you
do
not
mix
politics
with
your
profession
in
which
you
are
right
you
have
confidence
in
yourself
which
is
a
valuable
if
not
indispensable
quality
you
are
ambitious
which
within
reasonable
bounds
does
good
rather
than
harm
but
i
think
that
during
general
burnside
command
of
the
army
you
have
taken
counsel
of
your
ambition
and
thwarted
him
as
much
as
you
could
in
which
you
did
a
great
wrong
to
the
country
and
to
a
most
meritorious
and
honourable
brother
officer
i
have
heard
in
such
a
way
as
to
believe
it
of
your
recently
saying
that
both
the
army
and
the
government
needed
a
dictator
of
course
it
was
not
for
this
but
in
spite
of
it
that
i
gave
you
the
command
only
those
generals
who
gain
successes
can
set
up
dictators
what
i
now
ask
of
you
is
military
success
and
i
will
risk
the
dictatorship
the
government
will
support
you
to
the
utmost
of
its
ability
which
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
it
has
done
and
will
do
for
all
commanders
i
much
fear
that
the
spirit
which
you
have
aided
to
infuse
into
the
army
of
criticising
their
commander
and
withholding
confidence
from
him
will
now
turn
upon
you
neither
you
nor
napoleon
if
he
were
alive
again
could
get
any
good
out
of
an
army
while
such
a
spirit
prevails
in
it
and
now
beware
of
rashness
beware
of
rashness
but
with
energy
and
sleepless
vigilance
go
forward
and
give
us
victories
he
talks
to
me
like
a
father
exclaimed
hooker
enchanted
with
a
rebuke
such
as
this
he
was
a
fine
frank
soldierly
fellow
with
a
noble
figure
with
a
grand
fighting
head
fresh
complexion
and
bright
blue
eyes
he
was
a
good
organiser
he
put
a
stop
to
the
constant
desertions
he
felt
the
need
of
improving
the
northern
cavalry
and
he
groaned
at
the
spirit
with
which
mcclellan
had
infected
his
army
a
curious
collective
inertness
among
men
who
individually
were
daring
he
seems
to
have
been
highly
strung
the
very
little
wine
that
he
drank
perceptibly
affected
him
he
gave
it
up
altogether
in
his
campaigns
and
he
can
not
have
been
very
clever
for
the
handsomest
beating
that
lee
could
give
him
left
him
unaware
that
lee
was
a
general
in
the
end
of
april
he
crossed
the
rappahannock
and
the
rapidan
which
still
divided
the
two
armies
and
in
the
first
week
of
may
a
brief
campaign
full
of
stirring
incident
came
to
a
close
with
the
three
days
battle
of
chancellorsville
in
which
hooker
hurt
and
dazed
with
pain
lost
control
and
presence
of
mind
and
with
heavy
loss
drew
back
across
the
rappahannock
the
south
had
won
another
amazing
victory
but
stonewall
jackson
at
the
age
of
had
fallen
in
the
battle
abroad
this
crowning
disaster
to
the
north
seemed
to
presage
the
full
triumph
of
the
confederacy
and
it
was
a
gloomy
time
enough
for
lincoln
and
his
ministers
a
second
and
more
serious
invasion
by
lee
was
impending
and
the
lingering
progress
of
events
in
the
west
of
which
the
story
must
soon
be
resumed
caused
protracted
and
deepening
anxiety
but
the
tide
turned
soon
moreover
lincoln
military
perplexities
which
have
demanded
our
detailed
attention
during
these
particular
campaigns
were
very
nearly
at
an
end
we
have
here
to
turn
back
to
the
political
problem
of
his
presidency
for
the
bloody
and
inconclusive
battle
upon
the
antietam
more
than
seven
months
before
had
led
strangely
to
political
consequences
which
were
great
and
memorable
chapter
x
emancipation
when
the
news
of
a
second
battle
of
bull
run
reached
england
it
seemed
at
first
to
lord
john
russell
that
the
failure
of
the
north
was
certain
and
he
asked
palmerston
and
his
colleagues
to
consider
whether
they
must
not
soon
recognise
the
confederacy
and
whether
mediation
in
the
interest
of
peace
and
humanity
might
not
perhaps
follow
but
within
two
months
all
thoughts
of
recognising
the
confederacy
had
been
so
completely
put
aside
that
even
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
caused
no
renewal
of
the
suggestion
and
an
invitation
from
louis
napoleon
to
joint
action
of
this
kind
between
england
and
france
had
once
for
all
been
rejected
the
battle
of
antietam
had
been
fought
in
the
meantime
this
made
men
think
that
the
south
could
no
more
win
a
speedy
and
decisive
success
than
the
north
and
that
victory
must
rest
in
the
end
with
the
side
that
could
last
but
that
was
not
all
the
battle
of
antietam
was
followed
within
five
days
by
an
event
which
made
it
impossible
for
any
government
of
this
country
to
take
action
unfriendly
to
the
north
on
september
abraham
lincoln
set
his
hand
to
a
proclamation
of
which
the
principal
words
were
these
that
on
the
first
day
of
january
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
all
persons
held
as
slaves
within
any
state
or
designated
part
of
a
state
the
people
whereof
shall
then
be
in
rebellion
against
the
united
states
shall
be
then
thenceforward
and
forever
free
the
policy
and
the
true
effect
of
this
act
can
not
be
understood
without
some
examination
still
less
so
can
the
course
of
the
man
who
will
always
be
remembered
as
its
author
first
in
regard
to
the
legal
effect
of
the
proclamation
in
normal
times
the
president
would
of
course
not
have
had
the
power
which
even
the
legislature
did
not
possess
to
set
free
a
single
slave
the
proclamation
was
an
act
of
war
on
his
part
as
of
the
forces
by
which
slaves
were
to
be
taken
from
people
at
war
with
the
united
states
just
as
horses
or
carts
might
be
taken
to
subtract
from
their
resources
and
add
to
those
of
the
united
states
in
a
curiously
prophetic
manner
john
quincy
adams
had
argued
in
congress
many
years
before
that
if
rebellion
ever
arose
this
very
thing
might
be
done
adams
would
probably
have
claimed
that
the
command
of
the
president
became
law
in
the
states
which
took
part
in
the
rebellion
lincoln
only
claimed
legal
force
for
his
proclamation
in
so
far
as
it
was
an
act
of
war
based
on
sufficient
necessity
and
plainly
tending
to
help
the
northern
arms
if
the
legal
question
had
ever
been
tried
out
the
courts
would
no
doubt
have
had
to
hold
that
at
least
those
slaves
who
obtained
actual
freedom
under
the
proclamation
became
free
in
law
for
it
was
certainly
in
good
faith
an
act
of
war
and
the
military
result
justified
it
a
large
amount
of
labour
was
withdrawn
from
the
industry
necessary
to
the
south
and
by
the
end
of
the
war
coloured
troops
were
in
arms
for
the
north
rendering
services
especially
in
occupying
conquered
territory
that
was
unhealthy
for
white
troops
without
which
in
lincoln
opinion
the
war
could
never
have
been
finished
the
proclamation
had
indeed
an
indirect
effect
more
than
this
it
committed
the
north
to
a
course
from
which
there
could
be
no
turning
back
except
by
surrender
it
made
it
a
political
certainty
that
by
one
means
or
another
slavery
would
be
ended
if
the
north
won
but
in
lincoln
view
of
his
duty
as
president
this
ulterior
consequence
was
not
to
determine
his
action
the
fateful
step
by
which
the
end
of
slavery
was
precipitated
would
not
have
taken
the
form
it
did
take
if
it
had
not
come
to
commend
itself
to
him
as
a
military
measure
conducing
to
the
suppression
of
rebellion
on
the
broader
grounds
on
which
we
naturally
look
at
this
measure
many
people
in
the
north
had
as
we
have
seen
been
anxious
from
the
beginning
that
he
should
adopt
an
active
policy
of
freeing
southern
slaves
it
was
intolerable
to
think
that
the
war
might
end
and
leave
slavery
where
it
was
to
convert
the
war
into
a
crusade
against
slavery
seemed
to
many
the
best
way
of
arousing
and
uniting
the
north
this
argument
was
reinforced
by
some
of
the
american
ministers
abroad
they
were
aware
that
people
in
europe
misunderstood
and
disliked
the
constitutional
propriety
with
which
the
union
government
insisted
that
it
was
not
attacking
the
domestic
institutions
of
southern
states
english
people
did
not
know
the
american
constitution
and
when
told
that
the
north
did
not
threaten
to
abolish
slavery
would
answer
why
not
many
englishmen
who
might
dislike
the
north
and
might
have
their
doubts
as
to
whether
slavery
was
as
bad
as
it
was
said
to
be
would
none
the
less
have
respected
men
who
would
fight
against
it
they
had
no
interest
in
the
attempt
of
some
of
their
own
seceded
colonists
to
coerce
upon
some
metaphysical
ground
of
law
others
who
in
their
turn
wished
to
secede
from
them
seward
with
wonderful
misjudgment
had
instructed
ministers
abroad
to
explain
that
no
attack
was
threatened
on
slavery
for
he
was
afraid
that
the
purchasers
of
cotton
in
europe
would
feel
threatened
in
their
selfish
interests
the
agents
of
the
south
were
astute
enough
to
take
the
same
line
and
insist
like
him
that
the
north
was
no
more
hostile
to
slavery
than
the
south
if
this
misunderstanding
were
removed
english
hostility
to
the
north
would
never
again
take
a
dangerous
form
lincoln
who
knew
less
of
affairs
but
more
of
men
than
seward
was
easily
made
to
see
this
yet
with
full
knowledge
of
the
reasons
for
adopting
a
decided
policy
against
slavery
lincoln
waited
through
seventeen
months
of
the
war
till
the
moment
had
come
for
him
to
strike
his
blow
some
of
his
reasons
for
waiting
were
very
plain
he
was
not
going
to
take
action
on
the
alleged
ground
of
military
necessity
till
he
was
sure
that
the
necessity
existed
nor
was
he
going
to
take
it
till
it
would
actually
lead
to
the
emancipation
of
a
great
number
of
slaves
above
all
he
would
not
act
till
he
felt
that
the
north
generally
would
sustain
his
action
for
he
knew
better
than
congressmen
who
judged
from
their
own
friends
in
their
own
constituencies
how
doubtful
a
large
part
of
northern
opinion
really
was
we
have
seen
how
in
the
summer
of
he
felt
bound
to
disappoint
the
advanced
opinion
which
supported
frémont
he
continued
for
more
than
a
year
after
in
a
course
which
alienated
from
himself
the
confidence
of
the
men
with
whom
he
had
most
sympathy
he
did
this
deliberately
rather
than
imperil
the
unanimity
with
which
the
north
supported
the
war
there
was
indeed
grave
danger
of
splitting
the
north
in
two
if
he
appeared
unnecessarily
to
change
the
issue
from
union
to
liberation
we
have
to
remember
that
in
all
the
northern
states
the
right
of
the
southern
states
to
choose
for
themselves
about
slavery
had
been
fully
admitted
and
that
four
of
the
northern
states
were
themselves
slave
states
all
this
while
but
this
is
not
the
whole
explanation
of
his
delay
it
is
certain
that
apart
from
this
danger
he
would
at
first
rather
not
have
played
the
historic
part
which
he
did
play
as
the
liberator
of
the
slaves
if
he
could
have
succeeded
in
the
more
modest
part
of
encouraging
a
process
of
gradual
emancipation
in
his
annual
message
to
congress
in
december
he
laid
down
the
general
principles
of
his
policy
in
this
matter
he
gave
warning
in
advance
to
the
democrats
of
the
north
who
were
against
all
interference
with
southern
institutions
that
radical
and
extreme
measures
might
become
indispensable
to
military
success
and
if
indispensable
would
be
taken
but
he
declared
his
anxiety
that
if
possible
the
conflict
with
the
south
should
not
degenerate
into
a
violent
and
remorseless
revolutionary
struggle
for
he
looked
forward
with
fear
to
a
complete
overturning
of
the
social
system
of
the
south
he
feared
it
not
only
for
the
white
people
but
also
for
the
black
gradual
and
not
sudden
emancipation
he
said
in
a
later
message
is
better
for
all
it
is
now
probable
that
he
was
right
and
yet
it
is
difficult
not
to
sympathise
with
the
earnest
republicans
who
were
impatient
at
his
delay
who
were
puzzled
and
pained
by
the
free
and
easy
way
in
which
in
grave
conversation
he
would
allude
to
the
nigger
question
and
who
concluded
that
the
president
is
not
with
us
has
no
sound
sentiment
indeed
his
sentiment
did
differ
from
theirs
certainly
he
hated
slavery
for
he
had
contended
more
stubbornly
than
any
other
man
against
any
concession
which
seemed
to
him
to
perpetuate
slavery
by
stamping
it
with
approval
but
his
hatred
of
it
left
him
quite
without
the
passion
of
moral
indignation
against
the
slave
owners
in
whose
guilt
the
whole
country
north
and
south
seemed
to
him
an
accomplice
he
would
have
classed
that
very
natural
indignation
under
the
head
of
malice
i
shall
do
nothing
in
malice
he
wrote
to
a
citizen
of
louisiana
what
i
deal
with
is
too
vast
for
malicious
dealing
but
it
was
not
as
we
shall
see
before
long
too
vast
for
an
interest
as
sympathetic
as
it
was
matter
of
fact
in
the
welfare
of
the
negroes
they
were
actual
human
beings
to
him
and
he
knew
that
the
mere
abrogation
of
the
law
of
slavery
was
not
the
only
thing
necessary
to
their
advancement
looking
back
with
knowledge
of
what
happened
later
we
can
not
fail
to
be
glad
that
they
were
emancipated
somehow
but
we
are
forced
to
regret
that
they
could
not
have
been
emancipated
by
some
more
considerate
process
lincoln
perhaps
alone
among
the
americans
who
were
in
earnest
in
this
matter
looked
at
it
very
much
in
the
light
in
which
all
men
look
at
it
in
the
early
part
of
the
united
states
government
concluded
a
treaty
with
great
britain
for
the
more
effectual
suppression
of
the
african
slave
trade
and
it
happened
about
the
same
time
that
the
first
white
man
ever
executed
as
a
pirate
under
the
american
law
against
the
slave
trade
was
hanged
in
new
york
in
those
months
lincoln
was
privately
trying
to
bring
about
the
passing
by
the
legislature
of
delaware
of
an
act
for
emancipating
with
fit
provisions
for
their
welfare
the
few
slaves
in
that
state
conditionally
upon
compensation
to
be
paid
to
the
owners
by
the
united
states
he
hoped
that
if
this
example
were
set
by
delaware
it
would
be
followed
in
maryland
and
would
spread
later
the
delaware
house
were
favourable
to
the
scheme
but
the
senate
of
the
state
rejected
it
lincoln
now
made
a
more
public
appeal
in
favour
of
his
policy
in
march
he
sent
a
message
to
congress
which
has
already
been
quoted
and
in
which
he
urged
the
two
houses
to
pass
resolutions
pledging
the
united
states
to
give
pecuniary
help
to
any
state
which
adopted
gradual
emancipation
it
must
be
obvious
that
if
the
slave
states
of
the
north
could
have
been
led
to
adopt
this
policy
it
would
have
been
a
fitting
preliminary
to
any
action
which
might
be
taken
against
slavery
in
the
south
and
the
policy
might
have
been
extended
to
those
southern
states
which
were
first
recovered
for
the
union
the
point
however
upon
which
lincoln
dwelt
in
his
message
was
that
if
slavery
were
once
given
up
by
the
border
states
the
south
would
abandon
all
hope
that
they
would
ever
join
the
confederacy
in
private
letters
to
an
editor
of
a
newspaper
and
others
he
pressed
the
consideration
that
the
cost
of
compensated
abolition
was
small
in
proportion
to
what
might
be
gained
by
a
quicker
ending
of
the
war
during
the
discussion
of
his
proposal
in
congress
and
again
after
the
end
of
the
session
he
invited
the
senators
and
representatives
of
the
border
states
to
private
conference
with
him
in
which
he
besought
of
them
a
calm
and
enlarged
consideration
ranging
if
it
may
be
far
above
personal
and
partisan
politics
of
the
opportunity
of
good
now
open
to
them
the
hope
of
the
confederacy
was
as
he
then
conceived
fixed
upon
the
sympathy
which
it
might
arouse
in
the
border
states
two
of
which
kentucky
and
maryland
were
in
fact
invaded
that
year
with
some
hope
of
a
rising
among
the
inhabitants
the
lever
which
the
confederates
hoped
to
use
in
these
states
was
the
interest
of
the
slave
owners
there
break
that
lever
before
their
eyes
he
urged
but
the
hundred
and
one
reasons
which
can
always
be
found
against
action
presented
themselves
at
once
to
the
representatives
of
the
border
states
congress
itself
so
far
accepted
the
president
view
that
both
houses
passed
the
resolution
which
he
had
suggested
indeed
it
gladly
did
something
more
a
bill
such
as
lincoln
himself
had
prepared
as
a
congressman
fourteen
years
before
was
passed
for
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
compensation
was
paid
to
the
owners
a
sum
was
set
apart
to
help
the
settlement
in
liberia
of
any
of
the
slaves
who
were
willing
to
go
and
at
lincoln
suggestion
provision
was
added
for
the
education
of
the
negro
children
nothing
more
was
done
at
this
time
throughout
this
matter
lincoln
took
counsel
chiefly
with
himself
he
could
not
speak
his
full
thought
to
the
public
and
apparently
he
did
not
do
so
to
any
of
his
cabinet
supposing
that
the
border
states
had
yielded
to
his
persuasion
it
may
still
strike
us
as
a
very
sanguine
calculation
that
their
action
would
have
had
much
effect
upon
the
resolution
of
the
confederates
but
it
must
be
noted
that
when
lincoln
first
approached
the
representatives
of
the
border
states
the
highest
expectations
were
entertained
of
the
victory
that
mcclellan
would
win
in
virginia
and
when
he
made
his
last
rather
despairing
appeal
to
them
the
decision
to
withdraw
the
army
from
the
peninsula
had
not
yet
been
taken
if
a
really
heavy
blow
had
been
struck
at
the
confederates
in
virginia
their
chief
hope
of
retrieving
their
military
fortunes
would
certainly
have
lain
in
that
invasion
of
kentucky
which
did
shortly
afterwards
occur
and
which
was
greatly
encouraged
by
the
hope
of
a
rising
of
kentucky
men
who
wished
to
join
the
confederacy
this
part
of
lincoln
calculations
was
therefore
quite
reasonable
and
it
was
further
reasonable
to
suppose
that
if
the
south
had
then
given
in
and
congress
had
acted
in
the
spirit
of
the
resolution
which
it
had
passed
the
policy
of
gradual
emancipation
starting
in
the
border
states
would
have
spread
steadily
the
states
which
were
disposed
to
hold
out
against
the
inducement
that
the
cost
of
compensated
emancipation
if
they
adopted
it
would
be
borne
by
the
whole
union
would
have
done
so
at
a
great
risk
for
each
new
free
state
would
have
been
disposed
before
long
to
support
a
constitutional
amendment
to
impose
enfranchisement
possibly
with
no
compensation
upon
the
states
that
still
delayed
the
force
of
example
and
the
presence
of
this
fear
could
not
have
been
resisted
long
lincoln
was
not
a
man
who
could
be
accused
of
taking
any
course
without
a
reason
well
thought
out
we
can
safely
conclude
that
in
the
summer
of
he
nursed
a
hope
by
no
means
visionary
of
initiating
a
process
of
liberation
free
from
certain
evils
in
that
upon
which
he
was
driven
back
before
however
he
had
quite
abandoned
this
hope
he
had
already
begun
to
see
his
way
in
case
it
failed
his
last
appeal
to
the
border
states
was
made
on
july
while
mcclellan
army
still
lay
at
harrison
landing
on
the
following
day
he
privately
told
seward
and
bates
that
he
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
military
necessity
absolutely
essential
to
the
salvation
of
the
nation
that
we
must
free
the
slaves
or
be
ourselves
subdued
on
july
he
read
to
his
cabinet
the
first
draft
of
his
proclamation
of
emancipation
telling
them
before
he
consulted
them
that
substantially
his
mind
was
made
up
various
members
of
the
cabinet
raised
points
on
which
he
had
already
thought
and
had
come
to
a
conclusion
but
as
he
afterwards
told
a
friend
seward
raised
a
point
which
had
never
struck
him
before
he
said
that
if
issued
at
that
time
of
depression
just
after
the
failure
in
the
peninsula
the
proclamation
would
seem
like
a
cry
of
distress
and
that
it
would
have
a
much
better
effect
if
it
were
issued
after
some
military
success
seward
was
certainly
right
the
danger
of
division
in
the
north
would
have
been
increased
and
the
prospect
of
a
good
effect
abroad
would
have
been
diminished
if
the
proclamation
had
been
issued
at
a
time
of
depression
and
manifest
failure
lincoln
who
had
been
set
on
issuing
it
instantly
felt
the
force
of
this
objection
he
put
aside
his
draft
and
resolved
not
to
issue
the
proclamation
till
the
right
moment
and
apparently
resolved
to
keep
the
whole
question
open
in
his
own
mind
till
the
time
for
action
came
accordingly
the
two
months
which
followed
were
not
only
full
of
anxiety
about
the
war
they
were
full
for
him
of
a
suspense
painfully
maintained
it
troubled
him
perhaps
comparatively
little
that
he
was
driven
into
a
position
of
greater
aloofness
from
the
support
and
sympathy
of
any
party
or
school
he
must
now
expect
an
opposition
from
the
democrats
of
the
north
for
they
had
declared
themselves
strongly
against
the
resolution
which
he
had
induced
congress
to
pass
and
the
strong
republicans
for
their
part
had
acquiesced
in
it
coldly
some
of
them
contemptuously
in
may
of
this
year
he
had
been
forced
for
a
second
time
publicly
to
repress
a
keen
republican
general
who
tried
to
take
this
question
of
great
policy
into
his
own
hands
general
hunter
commanding
a
small
expedition
which
had
seized
port
royal
in
south
carolina
and
some
adjacent
islands
rich
in
cotton
had
in
a
grand
manner
assumed
to
declare
free
all
the
slaves
in
south
carolina
georgia
and
florida
this
of
course
could
not
be
let
pass
congress
too
had
been
occupied
in
the
summer
with
a
new
measure
for
confiscating
rebel
property
some
republicans
in
the
west
set
great
store
on
such
confiscation
other
republicans
saw
in
it
the
incidental
advantage
that
more
slaves
might
be
liberated
under
it
it
was
learnt
that
the
president
might
put
his
veto
upon
it
it
seemed
to
purport
contrary
to
the
constitution
to
attaint
the
property
of
rebels
after
their
death
and
lincoln
was
unwilling
that
the
constitution
should
be
stretched
in
the
direction
of
revengeful
harshness
the
objectionable
feature
in
the
bill
was
removed
and
lincoln
accepted
it
but
the
suspicion
with
which
many
republicans
were
beginning
to
regard
him
was
now
reinforced
by
a
certain
jealousy
of
congressmen
against
the
executive
power
they
grumbled
and
sneered
about
having
to
ascertain
the
royal
pleasure
before
they
could
legislate
this
was
an
able
energetic
and
truly
patriotic
congress
and
must
not
be
despised
for
its
reluctance
to
be
guided
by
lincoln
but
it
was
reluctant
throughout
august
and
september
he
had
to
deal
in
the
country
with
dread
on
the
one
side
of
any
revolutionary
action
and
belief
on
the
other
side
that
he
was
timid
and
the
precise
state
of
his
intentions
could
not
with
advantage
be
made
public
to
of
slavery
he
wrote
plainly
it
may
as
well
be
understood
once
for
all
that
i
shall
not
surrender
this
game
leaving
any
available
card
unplayed
to
its
most
zealous
opponents
he
had
to
speak
in
an
entirely
different
strain
while
the
second
battle
of
bull
run
was
impending
horace
greeley
published
in
the
york
an
open
letter
of
angry
complaint
about
lincoln
supposed
bias
for
slavery
lincoln
at
once
published
a
reply
to
his
letter
if
there
be
in
it
he
said
any
statements
or
assumptions
of
fact
which
i
may
know
to
be
erroneous
i
do
not
now
and
here
controvert
them
if
there
be
perceptible
in
it
an
impatient
and
dictatorial
tone
i
waive
it
in
deference
to
an
old
friend
whose
heart
i
have
always
supposed
to
be
right
my
paramount
object
in
this
struggle
is
to
save
the
union
if
i
could
save
the
union
without
freeing
any
slaves
i
would
do
it
and
if
i
could
save
it
by
freeing
all
the
slaves
i
would
do
it
and
if
i
could
save
it
by
freeing
some
and
leaving
others
alone
i
would
also
do
that
i
shall
do
less
whenever
i
shall
believe
what
i
am
doing
hurts
the
cause
and
i
shall
do
more
whenever
i
shall
believe
doing
more
will
help
the
cause
i
shall
adopt
new
views
so
fast
as
they
shall
appear
to
be
true
views
it
was
probably
easy
to
him
now
to
write
these
masterful
generalities
but
a
week
or
two
later
after
pope
defeat
he
had
to
engage
in
a
controversy
which
tried
his
feelings
much
more
sorely
it
had
really
grieved
him
that
clergymen
in
illinois
had
opposed
him
as
unorthodox
when
he
was
fighting
against
the
extension
of
slavery
now
a
week
or
two
after
his
correspondence
with
greeley
a
deputation
from
a
number
of
churches
in
chicago
waited
upon
him
and
some
of
their
members
spoke
to
him
with
assumed
authority
from
on
high
commanding
him
in
name
to
emancipate
the
slaves
he
said
i
am
approached
with
the
most
opposite
opinions
and
advice
and
that
by
religious
men
who
are
equally
certain
that
they
represent
the
divine
will
i
am
sure
that
either
the
one
or
the
other
class
is
mistaken
in
that
belief
and
perhaps
in
some
respects
both
i
hope
it
will
not
be
irreverent
for
me
to
say
that
if
it
is
probable
that
god
would
reveal
his
will
to
others
on
a
point
so
connected
with
my
duty
it
might
be
supposed
he
would
reveal
it
directly
to
me
what
good
would
a
proclamation
of
emancipation
from
me
do
especially
as
we
are
now
situated
i
do
not
want
to
issue
a
document
that
the
whole
world
will
see
must
necessarily
be
inoperative
like
the
pope
bull
against
the
comet
do
not
misunderstand
me
because
i
have
mentioned
these
objections
they
indicate
the
difficulties
that
have
thus
far
prevented
my
acting
in
some
such
way
as
you
desire
i
have
not
decided
against
a
proclamation
of
liberty
to
the
slaves
but
hold
the
matter
under
advisement
and
i
can
assure
you
that
the
subject
is
on
my
mind
by
day
and
night
more
than
any
other
whatever
shall
appear
to
be
god
will
i
will
do
the
language
of
this
speech
especially
when
the
touch
is
humorous
seems
that
of
a
strained
and
slightly
irritated
man
but
the
solemnity
blended
in
it
showed
lincoln
true
mind
in
this
month
september
he
composed
for
his
own
reading
alone
a
sad
and
inconclusive
fragment
of
meditation
which
was
found
after
his
death
the
will
of
god
prevails
he
wrote
in
great
contests
each
party
claims
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
god
both
may
be
and
one
must
be
wrong
god
can
not
be
for
and
against
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
in
the
present
civil
war
it
is
quite
possible
that
god
purpose
is
something
different
from
the
purpose
of
either
party
and
yet
the
human
instrumentalities
working
just
as
they
do
are
of
the
best
adaptation
to
effect
his
purpose
i
am
almost
ready
to
say
that
this
is
probably
true
that
god
wills
this
contest
and
wills
that
it
shall
not
end
yet
by
his
mere
great
power
on
the
minds
of
the
contestants
he
could
have
either
saved
or
destroyed
the
union
without
a
human
contest
yet
the
contest
began
and
having
begun
he
could
give
the
final
victory
to
either
side
any
day
yet
the
contest
proceeds
for
lincoln
own
part
it
seemed
his
plain
duty
to
do
what
in
the
circumstances
he
thought
safest
for
the
union
and
yet
he
was
almost
of
a
mind
with
the
deputation
which
had
preached
to
him
that
he
must
be
doing
god
will
in
taking
a
great
step
towards
emancipation
the
solution
that
the
great
step
must
be
taken
at
the
first
opportune
moment
was
doubtless
clear
enough
in
principle
but
it
must
always
remain
arguable
whether
any
particular
moment
was
opportune
he
told
soon
afterwards
how
his
mind
was
finally
made
up
on
the
day
that
he
received
the
news
of
the
battle
of
antietam
the
draft
proclamation
was
taken
from
its
drawer
and
studied
afresh
his
visit
to
mcclellan
on
the
battlefield
intervened
but
on
the
fifth
day
after
the
battle
the
cabinet
was
suddenly
called
together
when
the
ministers
had
assembled
lincoln
first
entertained
them
by
reading
the
short
chapter
of
artemus
ward
entitled
outrage
at
utica
it
is
less
amusing
than
most
of
artemus
ward
but
it
had
just
appeared
it
pleased
all
the
ministers
except
stanton
to
whom
the
frivolous
reading
he
sometimes
had
to
hear
from
lincoln
was
a
standing
vexation
and
it
was
precisely
that
sort
of
relief
to
which
lincoln
mind
when
overwrought
could
always
turn
having
thus
composed
himself
for
business
he
reminded
his
cabinet
that
he
had
as
they
were
aware
thought
a
great
deal
about
the
relation
of
the
war
to
slavery
and
had
a
few
weeks
before
read
them
a
draft
proclamation
on
this
subject
ever
since
then
he
said
his
mind
had
been
occupied
on
the
matter
and
though
he
wished
it
were
a
better
time
he
thought
the
time
had
come
now
when
the
rebel
army
was
at
frederick
he
is
related
to
have
continued
i
determined
as
soon
as
it
should
be
driven
out
of
maryland
to
issue
a
proclamation
of
emancipation
such
as
i
thought
likely
to
be
most
useful
i
said
nothing
to
any
one
but
i
made
the
promise
to
myself
and
here
he
hesitated
a
little
to
my
maker
the
rebel
army
is
now
driven
out
and
i
am
going
to
fulfil
that
promise
i
have
got
you
together
to
hear
what
i
have
written
down
i
do
not
wish
your
advice
about
the
main
matter
for
that
i
have
determined
for
myself
this
i
say
without
intending
anything
but
respect
for
any
one
of
you
he
then
invited
their
suggestions
upon
the
expressions
used
in
his
draft
and
other
minor
matters
and
concluded
one
other
observation
i
will
make
i
know
very
well
that
many
others
might
in
this
matter
as
in
others
do
better
than
i
can
and
if
i
was
satisfied
that
the
public
confidence
was
more
fully
possessed
by
any
one
of
them
than
by
me
and
knew
of
any
constitutional
way
in
which
he
could
be
put
in
my
place
he
should
have
it
i
would
gladly
yield
it
to
him
but
though
i
believe
i
have
not
so
much
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
as
i
had
some
time
since
i
do
not
know
that
all
things
considered
any
other
person
has
more
and
however
this
may
be
there
is
no
way
in
which
i
can
have
any
other
man
put
where
i
am
i
am
here
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
and
bear
the
responsibility
of
taking
the
course
which
i
feel
i
ought
to
take
then
he
read
his
draft
and
in
the
long
discussion
which
followed
and
owing
to
which
a
few
slight
changes
were
made
in
it
he
told
them
further
without
any
false
reserve
just
how
he
came
to
his
decision
in
his
great
perplexity
he
had
gone
on
his
knees
before
the
battle
of
antietam
and
like
a
child
he
had
promised
that
if
a
victory
was
given
which
drove
the
enemy
out
of
maryland
he
would
consider
it
as
an
indication
that
it
was
his
duty
to
move
forward
it
might
be
thought
strange
he
said
that
he
had
in
this
way
submitted
the
disposal
of
matters
when
the
way
was
not
clear
to
his
mind
what
he
should
do
god
had
decided
this
question
in
favour
of
the
slaves
such
is
the
story
of
what
we
may
now
remember
as
one
of
the
signal
events
in
the
chequered
progress
of
christianity
we
have
to
follow
its
consequences
a
little
further
these
were
not
at
first
all
that
its
author
would
have
hoped
commendation
in
newspapers
and
by
distinguished
individuals
is
he
said
in
a
private
letter
all
that
a
vain
man
could
wish
but
recruits
for
the
army
did
not
seem
to
come
in
faster
in
october
and
november
there
were
elections
for
congress
and
in
a
number
of
states
the
democrats
gained
considerably
though
it
was
noteworthy
that
the
republicans
held
their
ground
not
only
in
new
england
and
in
the
furthest
western
states
but
also
in
the
border
slave
states
the
democrats
who
from
this
time
on
became
very
formidable
to
lincoln
had
other
matters
of
complaint
as
will
be
seen
later
but
they
chiefly
denounced
the
president
for
trying
to
turn
the
war
into
one
against
slavery
the
constitution
as
it
is
and
the
union
as
it
was
had
been
their
election
cry
the
good
hearing
that
they
got
now
as
at
a
later
time
was
due
to
the
fact
that
people
were
depressed
about
the
war
and
it
is
plain
enough
that
lincoln
had
been
well
advised
in
delaying
his
action
till
after
a
military
success
as
it
was
there
was
much
that
seemed
to
show
that
public
confidence
in
him
was
not
strong
but
public
confidence
in
any
man
is
hard
to
estimate
and
the
forces
that
in
the
end
move
opinion
most
are
not
quickly
apparent
there
are
little
indications
that
his
power
and
character
were
slowly
establishing
their
hold
it
seems
for
instance
to
have
been
about
this
time
that
old
abe
or
uncle
abe
began
to
be
widely
known
among
common
people
by
the
significant
name
of
father
abraham
and
his
secretaries
say
that
he
was
becoming
conscious
that
his
official
utterances
had
a
deeper
effect
on
public
opinion
than
any
immediate
response
to
them
in
congress
showed
in
his
annual
message
of
december
lincoln
put
before
congress
probably
with
little
hope
of
result
a
comprehensive
policy
for
dealing
with
slavery
justly
and
finally
he
proposed
that
a
constitutional
amendment
should
be
submitted
to
the
people
providing
first
that
compensation
should
be
given
in
united
states
bonds
to
any
state
whether
now
in
rebellion
or
not
which
should
abolish
slavery
before
the
year
secondly
that
the
slaves
who
had
once
enjoyed
actual
freedom
through
the
chances
of
the
war
should
be
permanently
free
and
that
their
owners
should
be
compensated
thirdly
that
congress
should
have
authority
to
spend
money
on
colonisation
for
negroes
even
if
the
greater
part
of
these
objects
could
have
been
accomplished
without
a
constitutional
amendment
it
is
evident
that
such
a
procedure
would
have
been
more
satisfactory
in
the
eventual
resettlement
of
the
union
he
urged
in
his
message
how
desirable
it
was
as
a
part
of
the
effort
to
restore
the
union
that
the
whole
north
should
be
agreed
in
a
concerted
policy
as
to
slavery
and
that
parties
should
for
this
purpose
reconsider
their
positions
the
dogmas
of
the
quiet
past
he
said
are
inadequate
to
the
stormy
present
the
occasion
is
piled
high
with
difficulty
and
we
must
rise
with
the
occasion
as
our
case
is
new
so
we
must
think
anew
and
act
anew
we
must
disenthrall
ourselves
and
then
we
shall
save
our
country
fellow
citizens
we
can
not
escape
history
we
of
this
congress
and
this
administration
will
be
remembered
in
spite
of
ourselves
no
personal
significance
or
insignificance
can
spare
one
or
another
of
us
we
say
we
are
for
the
union
the
world
will
not
forget
that
we
say
this
we
know
how
to
save
the
union
the
world
knows
we
do
know
how
to
save
it
in
giving
freedom
to
the
slave
we
assure
freedom
to
the
free
we
shall
nobly
save
or
meanly
lose
the
last
best
hope
of
earth
other
means
may
succeed
this
could
not
fail
the
last
four
words
expressed
too
confident
a
hope
as
to
what
northern
policy
apart
from
northern
arms
could
do
towards
ending
the
war
but
it
was
impossible
to
exaggerate
the
value
which
a
policy
concerted
between
parties
in
a
spirit
of
moderation
would
have
had
in
the
settlement
after
victory
every
honest
democrat
who
then
refused
any
action
against
slavery
must
have
regretted
it
before
three
years
were
out
and
many
sensible
republicans
who
saw
no
use
in
such
moderation
may
have
lived
to
regret
their
part
too
nothing
was
done
it
is
thought
that
lincoln
expected
this
but
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
would
begin
to
operate
within
a
month
it
would
produce
by
the
end
of
the
war
a
situation
in
which
the
country
would
be
compelled
to
decide
on
the
principle
of
slavery
and
lincoln
had
at
least
done
his
part
in
preparing
men
to
face
the
issue
before
this
the
nervous
and
irritable
feeling
of
many
northern
politicians
who
found
in
emancipation
a
good
subject
for
quarrel
among
themselves
and
in
the
slow
progress
of
the
war
a
good
subject
of
quarrel
with
the
administration
led
to
a
crisis
in
lincoln
cabinet
radicals
were
inclined
to
think
seward
influence
in
the
administration
the
cause
of
all
public
evils
some
of
them
had
now
got
hold
of
a
foolish
private
letter
which
he
had
written
to
adams
in
england
a
few
months
before
denouncing
the
advocates
of
emancipation
desiring
his
downfall
they
induced
a
small
caucus
of
republican
senators
to
speak
in
the
name
of
the
party
and
the
nation
and
send
the
president
a
resolution
demanding
such
changes
in
his
cabinet
as
would
produce
better
results
in
the
war
discontented
men
of
opposite
opinions
could
unite
in
demanding
success
in
the
war
and
conservative
senators
joined
in
this
resolution
hoping
that
it
would
get
rid
not
only
of
seward
but
also
of
chase
and
stanton
the
objects
of
their
particular
antipathy
seward
on
hearing
of
this
gave
lincoln
his
resignation
which
was
kept
private
though
egotistic
he
was
a
clever
man
and
evidently
a
pleasant
man
to
work
with
he
was
a
useful
minister
under
a
wise
chief
though
he
later
proved
a
harmful
one
under
a
foolish
chief
stanton
was
most
loyal
and
invaluable
as
head
of
the
war
department
chase
as
lincoln
said
in
private
afterwards
was
a
pretty
good
fellow
and
a
very
able
man
lincoln
had
complete
confidence
in
him
as
a
finance
minister
and
could
not
easily
have
replaced
him
but
this
handsome
dignified
and
righteous
person
was
unhappily
a
sneak
lincoln
found
as
time
went
on
that
if
he
ever
had
to
do
what
was
disagreeable
to
some
important
man
chase
would
pay
court
to
that
important
man
and
hint
how
differently
he
himself
would
have
done
as
president
on
this
occasion
he
was
evidently
aware
that
chase
had
encouraged
the
senators
who
attacked
seward
much
as
he
wished
to
retain
each
of
the
two
for
his
own
worth
he
was
above
all
determined
that
one
should
not
gain
a
victory
over
the
other
accordingly
when
a
deputation
of
nine
important
senators
came
to
lincoln
to
present
their
grievances
against
seward
they
found
themselves
to
their
great
annoyance
confronted
with
all
the
cabinet
except
seward
who
had
resigned
and
they
were
invited
by
lincoln
to
discuss
the
matter
in
his
presence
with
these
ministers
chase
to
his
still
greater
annoyance
found
himself
as
the
principal
minister
there
compelled
for
decency
sake
to
defend
seward
from
the
very
attack
which
he
had
helped
to
instigate
the
deputation
withdrew
not
sure
that
after
all
it
wanted
seward
removed
chase
next
day
tendered
as
was
natural
his
resignation
lincoln
was
able
now
that
he
had
the
resignations
of
both
men
to
persuade
both
of
their
joint
duty
to
continue
in
the
public
service
by
this
remarkable
piece
of
riding
he
saved
the
union
from
a
great
danger
the
democratic
opposition
not
actually
to
the
prosecution
of
the
war
but
to
any
and
every
measure
essential
for
it
was
now
developing
and
a
serious
division
such
as
at
this
stage
any
important
resignation
would
have
produced
in
the
ranks
of
the
republicans
or
as
they
now
called
themselves
the
union
men
would
have
been
perilous
on
the
first
day
of
january
the
president
signed
the
further
proclamation
needed
to
give
effect
to
emancipation
the
small
portions
of
the
south
which
were
not
in
rebellion
were
duly
excepted
the
naval
and
military
authorities
were
ordered
to
maintain
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
seeking
their
protection
the
slaves
were
enjoined
to
abstain
from
violence
and
to
labour
faithfully
for
reasonable
wages
if
opportunity
were
given
them
all
suitable
slaves
were
to
be
taken
into
armed
service
especially
for
garrison
duties
before
the
end
of
a
hundred
thousand
coloured
men
were
already
serving
as
combatants
or
as
labourers
on
military
work
in
about
equal
number
they
were
needed
for
volunteering
was
getting
slack
and
the
work
of
guarding
and
repairing
railway
lines
was
specially
repellent
to
northern
volunteers
the
coloured
regiments
fought
well
they
behaved
well
in
every
way
atrocious
threats
of
vengeance
on
them
and
their
white
officers
were
officially
uttered
by
jefferson
davis
but
except
for
one
hideous
massacre
wrought
in
the
hottest
of
hot
blood
only
a
few
crimes
by
individuals
were
committed
in
execution
of
these
threats
to
lincoln
himself
it
was
a
stirring
thought
that
when
democratic
government
was
finally
vindicated
and
restored
by
the
victory
of
the
union
then
there
will
be
some
black
men
who
can
remember
that
with
silent
tongue
and
clenched
teeth
and
steady
eye
and
bayonet
they
have
helped
mankind
on
to
this
great
consummation
there
was
however
prejudice
at
first
among
many
northern
officers
against
negro
enlistment
the
greatest
of
the
few
great
american
artists
gaudens
commemorated
in
sculpture
as
the
donor
of
the
new
playing
fields
at
harvard
commemorated
by
his
gift
the
action
of
a
brilliant
and
popular
massachusetts
officer
robert
gould
shaw
who
set
the
example
of
leaving
his
own
beloved
regiment
to
take
command
of
a
coloured
regiment
at
the
head
of
which
he
died
gallantly
leading
them
and
gallantly
followed
by
them
in
a
desperate
fight
it
was
easier
to
raise
and
train
these
negro
soldiers
than
to
arrange
for
the
control
shelter
and
employment
of
the
other
refugees
who
crowded
especially
to
the
protection
of
grant
army
in
the
west
the
efforts
made
for
their
benefit
can
not
be
related
here
but
the
recollections
of
army
chaplain
john
eaton
whom
grant
selected
to
take
charge
of
them
in
the
west
throw
a
little
more
light
on
lincoln
and
on
the
spirit
of
his
dealing
with
the
nigger
question
when
eaton
after
some
time
had
to
come
to
washington
upon
the
business
of
his
charge
and
to
visit
the
president
he
received
that
impression
of
versatile
power
and
of
easy
mastery
over
many
details
as
well
as
over
broad
issues
which
many
who
worked
under
lincoln
have
described
but
he
was
above
all
struck
with
the
fact
that
from
a
very
slight
experience
in
early
life
lincoln
had
gained
a
knowledge
of
negro
character
such
as
very
few
indeed
in
the
north
possessed
he
was
subjected
to
many
seemingly
trivial
questions
of
which
he
was
quick
enough
to
see
the
grave
purpose
about
all
sorts
of
persons
and
things
in
the
west
but
he
was
also
examined
closely
in
a
way
which
commanded
his
fullest
respect
as
an
expert
about
the
ideas
understanding
and
expectations
of
the
ordinary
negroes
under
his
care
and
more
particularly
as
to
the
past
history
and
the
attainments
of
the
few
negroes
who
had
become
prominent
men
and
who
therefore
best
illustrated
the
real
capacities
of
their
race
later
visits
to
the
capital
and
to
lincoln
deepened
this
impression
and
convinced
eaton
though
by
trifling
signs
of
the
rare
quality
of
lincoln
sympathy
once
after
eaton
difficult
business
had
been
disposed
of
the
president
turned
to
relating
his
own
recent
worries
about
a
colony
of
negroes
which
he
was
trying
to
establish
on
a
small
island
off
hayti
there
flourishes
in
southern
latitudes
a
minute
creature
called
or
the
jigger
which
can
inflict
great
pain
on
barefooted
people
by
housing
itself
under
their
this
colony
had
a
plague
of
jiggers
and
every
expedient
for
defeating
them
had
failed
lincoln
was
not
merely
giving
the
practical
attention
to
this
difficulty
that
might
perhaps
be
expected
the
chaplain
was
amazed
to
find
that
at
that
moment
at
the
turning
point
of
the
war
a
few
days
only
after
vicksburg
and
gettysburg
with
his
enormous
the
president
mind
had
room
for
real
and
keen
distress
about
the
toes
of
the
blacks
in
the
cow
island
at
the
end
of
yet
another
interview
eaton
was
startled
by
the
question
put
by
the
president
with
an
air
of
shyness
whether
frederick
douglass
a
negro
preacher
could
be
induced
to
visit
him
of
course
he
could
frederick
douglass
was
then
reputed
to
be
the
ablest
man
ever
born
as
a
negro
slave
he
must
have
met
many
of
the
best
and
kindest
northern
friends
of
the
negro
and
he
went
to
lincoln
distressed
at
some
points
in
his
policy
particularly
at
his
failure
to
make
reprisals
for
murders
of
negro
prisoners
by
southern
troops
when
he
came
away
he
was
in
a
state
little
short
of
ecstasy
it
was
not
because
he
now
understood
as
he
did
lincoln
policy
lincoln
had
indeed
won
his
warm
approval
when
he
told
him
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
of
his
horror
of
killing
men
in
cold
blood
for
what
had
been
done
by
others
and
his
dread
of
what
might
follow
such
a
policy
but
he
had
a
deeper
gratification
the
strangeness
of
which
it
is
sad
to
realise
he
treated
me
as
a
man
exclaimed
douglass
he
did
not
let
me
feel
for
a
moment
that
there
was
any
difference
in
the
colour
of
our
skins
perhaps
the
hardest
effort
of
speech
that
lincoln
ever
essayed
was
an
address
to
negroes
which
had
to
do
with
this
very
subject
of
colour
his
audience
were
men
who
had
been
free
from
birth
or
for
some
time
and
were
believed
to
be
leaders
among
their
community
it
was
object
to
induce
some
of
them
to
be
pioneers
in
an
attempt
at
colonisation
in
some
suitable
climate
an
attempt
which
he
felt
must
fail
if
it
started
with
negroes
whose
intellects
were
clouded
by
slavery
he
clung
to
these
projects
of
colonisation
as
probably
the
best
among
the
various
means
by
which
the
improvement
of
the
negro
must
be
attempted
because
their
race
suffering
the
greatest
wrong
ever
inflicted
on
any
people
would
yet
be
far
removed
from
being
on
an
equality
with
the
white
race
when
they
ceased
to
be
slaves
a
physical
difference
broader
than
exists
between
almost
any
other
two
races
and
constituting
a
greater
disadvantage
to
us
both
would
always
set
a
ban
upon
the
negroes
even
where
they
were
best
treated
in
america
this
unpalatable
fact
he
put
before
them
with
that
total
absence
of
pretence
which
was
probably
the
only
possible
form
of
tact
in
such
a
discussion
with
no
affectation
of
a
hope
that
progress
would
remove
it
or
of
a
desire
that
the
ordinary
white
man
should
lose
the
instinct
that
kept
him
apart
from
the
black
but
this
only
makes
more
apparent
his
simple
recognition
of
an
equality
and
fellowship
which
did
exist
between
him
and
his
hearers
in
a
larger
matter
than
that
of
social
intercourse
or
political
combination
his
appeal
to
their
capacity
for
taking
large
and
unselfish
views
was
as
direct
and
as
confident
as
in
his
addresses
to
his
own
people
it
was
made
in
the
language
of
a
man
to
whom
the
public
spirit
which
might
exist
among
black
people
was
of
the
same
quality
as
that
which
existed
among
white
in
whose
belief
he
and
his
hearers
could
equally
find
happiness
in
being
worthy
of
themselves
and
in
realising
the
claim
of
kindred
to
the
great
god
who
made
them
it
may
be
well
here
without
waiting
to
trace
further
the
course
of
the
war
in
which
at
the
point
where
we
left
it
the
slow
but
irresistible
progress
of
conquest
was
about
to
set
in
to
recount
briefly
the
later
stages
of
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
america
in
it
became
apparent
that
popular
feeling
in
missouri
and
in
maryland
was
getting
ripe
for
abolition
bills
were
introduced
into
congress
to
compensate
their
states
if
they
did
away
with
slavery
the
compensation
was
to
be
larger
if
the
abolition
was
immediate
and
not
gradual
there
was
a
majority
in
each
house
for
these
bills
but
the
democratic
minority
was
able
to
kill
them
in
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
methods
of
filibustering
or
as
we
call
it
obstruction
to
which
the
procedure
of
that
body
seems
well
adapted
the
republican
majority
had
not
been
very
zealous
for
the
bills
its
members
asked
why
compensate
for
a
wrong
which
they
had
begun
to
feel
would
soon
be
abolished
without
compensation
but
their
leaders
at
least
did
their
best
for
the
bills
it
would
have
been
idle
after
the
failure
of
these
proposals
to
introduce
the
bills
that
had
been
contemplated
for
buying
out
the
loyal
slave
owners
in
west
virginia
kentucky
and
tennessee
which
was
now
fast
being
regained
for
the
union
lincoln
after
his
message
of
december
recognised
it
as
useless
for
him
to
press
again
the
principles
of
gradual
emancipation
or
of
compensation
as
to
which
it
is
worth
remembrance
that
the
compensation
which
he
proposed
was
for
loyal
and
disloyal
owners
alike
his
administration
however
bought
every
suitable
slave
in
delaware
for
service
service
as
a
free
man
in
the
army
in
the
course
of
a
remarkable
development
of
public
opinion
began
to
be
manifest
in
the
states
chiefly
concerned
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
maryland
whose
representatives
had
paid
so
little
attention
to
lincoln
two
years
before
passed
an
amendment
to
the
state
constitution
abolishing
slavery
without
compensation
a
movement
in
the
same
direction
was
felt
to
be
making
progress
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
missouri
followed
maryland
example
in
january
meanwhile
louisiana
had
been
reconquered
and
the
unionists
in
these
states
constantly
encouraged
and
protected
by
lincoln
when
congress
looked
upon
them
somewhat
coldly
or
his
generals
showed
jealousy
of
their
action
had
banded
themselves
together
to
form
state
governments
with
constitutions
that
forbade
slavery
lincoln
it
may
be
noted
had
suggested
to
louisiana
that
it
would
be
well
to
frame
some
plan
by
which
the
best
educated
of
the
negroes
should
be
admitted
to
the
franchise
four
years
after
his
death
a
constitutional
amendment
was
passed
by
which
any
distinction
as
to
franchise
on
the
ground
of
race
or
colour
is
forbidden
in
america
the
policy
of
giving
the
vote
to
negroes
indiscriminately
had
commended
itself
to
the
cold
pedantry
of
some
persons
including
chase
on
the
ground
of
some
natural
right
of
all
men
to
the
suffrage
but
it
was
adopted
as
the
most
effective
protection
for
the
negroes
against
laws
as
to
vagrancy
and
the
like
by
which
it
was
feared
they
might
practically
be
enslaved
again
whatever
the
excuse
for
it
it
would
seem
to
have
proved
in
fact
a
great
obstacle
to
healthy
relations
between
the
two
races
the
true
policy
in
such
a
matter
is
doubtless
that
which
rhodes
and
other
statesmen
adopted
in
the
cape
colony
and
which
lincoln
had
advocated
in
the
case
of
louisiana
it
would
be
absurd
to
imagine
that
the
spirit
which
could
champion
the
rights
of
the
negro
and
yet
face
fairly
the
abiding
difficulty
of
his
case
died
in
america
with
lincoln
but
it
lost
for
many
a
year
to
come
its
only
great
exponent
but
the
question
of
overwhelming
importance
between
the
principles
of
slavery
and
of
freedom
was
ready
for
final
decision
when
local
opinion
in
six
slave
states
was
already
moving
as
we
have
seen
the
republican
convention
of
which
again
chose
lincoln
as
its
candidate
for
the
presidency
declared
itself
in
favour
of
a
constitutional
amendment
to
abolish
slavery
once
for
all
throughout
america
whether
the
first
suggestion
came
from
him
or
not
it
is
known
that
lincoln
private
influence
was
energetically
used
to
procure
this
resolution
of
the
convention
in
his
message
to
congress
in
he
urged
the
initiation
of
this
amendment
observation
of
elections
made
it
all
but
certain
that
the
next
congress
would
be
ready
to
take
this
action
but
lincoln
pleaded
with
the
present
doubtful
congress
for
the
advantage
which
would
be
gained
by
ready
and
if
possible
unanimous
concurrence
in
the
north
in
the
course
which
would
soon
prevail
the
necessary
resolution
was
passed
in
the
senate
but
in
the
house
of
representatives
till
within
a
few
hours
of
the
vote
it
was
said
to
be
the
toss
of
a
copper
whether
the
majority
of
required
for
such
a
purpose
would
be
obtained
in
the
efforts
made
on
either
side
to
win
over
the
few
doubtful
voters
lincoln
had
taken
his
part
right
or
wrong
he
was
not
the
man
to
see
a
great
and
beneficent
act
in
danger
of
postponement
without
being
tempted
to
secure
it
if
he
could
do
so
by
terrifying
some
unprincipled
and
opponents
with
the
knowledge
that
he
was
always
acquiring
of
the
persons
in
politics
he
had
been
able
to
pick
out
two
democratic
congressmen
who
were
fit
for
his
purpose
presumably
they
lay
under
suspicion
of
one
of
those
treasonable
practices
which
martial
law
under
lincoln
treated
very
unceremoniously
he
sent
for
them
he
told
them
that
the
gaining
of
a
certain
number
of
doubtful
votes
would
secure
the
resolution

he
told
them
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
war
time
exercised
great
and
dreadful
powers
and
he
told
them
that
he
looked
to
them
personally
to
get
him
those
votes
whether
this
wrong
manoeuvre
affected
the
result
or
not
on
january
the
resolution
was
passed
in
the
house
by
a
majority
with
a
few
votes
to
spare
and
the
great
crowd
in
the
galleries
defying
all
precedent
broke
out
in
a
demonstration
of
enthusiasm
which
some
still
recall
as
the
most
memorable
scene
in
their
lives
on
december
of
that
year
when
lincoln
had
been
eight
months
dead
william
seward
as
secretary
of
state
was
able
to
certify
that
the
requisite
majority
of
states
had
passed
the
thirteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
the
cause
of
that
irrepressible
conflict
which
he
had
foretold
and
in
which
he
had
played
a
weak
but
valuable
part
was
for
ever
extinguished
at
the
present
day
alike
in
the
british
empire
and
in
america
the
unending
difficulty
of
wholesome
human
relations
between
races
of
different
and
unequal
development
exercises
many
minds
but
this
difficulty
can
not
obscure
the
great
service
done
by
those
who
first
in
england
and
later
and
more
hardly
in
america
stamped
out
that
cardinal
principle
of
error
that
any
race
is
without
its
human
claim
among
these
men
william
lloyd
garrison
lived
to
see
the
fruit
of
his
labours
and
to
know
and
have
friendly
intercourse
with
lincoln
there
have
been
some
comparable
instances
in
which
men
with
such
different
characters
and
methods
have
unconsciously
conspired
for
a
common
end
as
these
two
did
when
garrison
was
projecting
the
liberator
and
lincoln
began
shaping
himself
for
honourable
public
work
in
the
vague
the
part
that
lincoln
played
in
these
events
did
not
seem
to
him
a
personal
achievement
of
his
own
he
appeared
to
himself
rather
as
an
instrument
i
claim
not
he
once
said
in
this
connection
to
have
controlled
events
but
confess
plainly
that
events
have
controlled
me
in
when
a
petition
was
sent
to
him
from
some
children
that
there
should
be
no
more
child
slaves
he
wrote
please
tell
these
little
people
that
i
am
very
glad
their
young
hearts
are
so
full
of
just
and
generous
sympathy
and
that
while
i
have
not
the
power
to
grant
all
they
ask
i
trust
they
will
remember
that
god
has
and
that
as
it
seems
he
wills
to
do
it
yet
at
least
he
redeemed
the
boyish
pledge
that
has
been
fancifully
perhaps
ascribed
to
him
each
opportunity
that
to
his
judgment
ever
presented
itself
of
striking
some
blow
for
human
freedom
was
taken
the
blows
were
timed
and
directed
by
the
full
force
of
his
sagacity
and
they
were
never
restrained
by
private
ambition
or
fear
it
is
probable
that
upon
that
cool
review
which
in
the
case
of
this
singular
figure
is
difficult
the
sense
of
his
potent
accomplishment
would
not
diminish
but
increase
chapter
xi
the
approach
of
victory
war
to
the
end
of
the
events
of
the
eastern
theatre
of
war
have
been
followed
into
the
early
summer
of
when
lee
was
for
the
second
time
about
to
invade
the
north
the
western
theatre
of
war
has
been
left
unnoticed
since
the
end
of
may
from
that
time
to
the
end
of
the
year
no
definite
progress
was
made
here
by
either
side
but
here
also
the
perplexities
of
the
military
administration
were
considerable
and
in
lincoln
life
it
must
be
noted
that
in
these
months
the
strain
of
anxiety
about
the
eastern
army
and
about
the
policy
of
emancipation
was
accompanied
by
acute
doubt
in
regard
to
the
conduct
of
war
in
the
west
when
halleck
had
been
summoned
from
the
west
lincoln
had
again
a
general
by
his
side
in
washington
to
exercise
command
under
him
of
all
the
armies
halleck
was
a
man
of
some
intellectual
distinction
who
might
be
expected
to
take
a
broad
view
of
the
war
as
a
whole
this
and
his
freedom
from
petty
feelings
as
to
which
lincoln
known
opinion
of
him
can
be
corroborated
doubtless
made
him
useful
as
an
adviser
nor
for
a
considerable
time
was
there
any
man
with
apparently
better
qualifications
for
his
position
but
lincoln
soon
found
as
has
been
seen
that
halleck
lacked
energy
of
will
and
can
not
have
been
long
in
discovering
that
his
judgment
was
not
very
good
the
president
had
thus
to
make
the
best
use
he
could
of
expert
advice
upon
which
he
would
not
have
been
justified
in
relying
very
fully
when
halleck
arrived
at
corinth
at
the
end
of
may
the
whole
of
western
and
middle
tennessee
was
for
the
time
clear
of
the
enemy
and
he
turned
his
attention
at
once
to
the
long
delayed
project
of
rescuing
the
unionists
in
eastern
tennessee
which
was
occupied
by
a
confederate
army
under
general
kirby
smith
his
object
was
to
seize
chattanooga
which
lay
about
miles
to
the
east
of
him
and
invade
eastern
tennessee
by
way
of
the
valley
of
the
tennessee
river
which
cuts
through
the
mountains
behind
chattanooga
with
this
in
view
he
would
doubtless
have
been
wise
if
he
had
first
continued
his
advance
with
his
whole
force
against
the
confederate
army
under
beauregard
which
after
evacuating
corinth
had
fallen
back
to
rest
and
recruit
in
a
far
healthier
situation
miles
further
south
beauregard
would
have
been
obliged
either
to
fight
him
with
inferior
numbers
or
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
fortress
of
vicksburg
as
it
was
halleck
spent
the
month
of
june
merely
in
repairing
the
railway
line
which
runs
from
corinth
in
the
direction
of
chattanooga
when
he
was
called
to
washington
he
left
grant
who
for
several
months
past
had
been
kept
idle
as
his
second
in
command
in
independent
command
of
a
force
which
was
to
remain
near
the
mississippi
confronting
beauregard
but
he
restricted
him
to
a
merely
defensive
part
by
ordering
him
to
keep
a
part
of
his
army
ready
to
send
to
buell
whenever
that
general
needed
it
as
he
soon
did
buell
who
again
took
over
his
former
independent
command
was
ordered
by
halleck
to
advance
on
chattanooga
using
corinth
as
his
base
of
supply
buell
had
wished
that
the
base
for
the
advance
upon
chattanooga
should
be
transferred
to
nashville
in
the
centre
of
tennessee
in
which
case
the
line
of
railway
communication
would
have
been
shorter
and
also
less
exposed
to
raids
by
the
southern
cavalry
after
halleck
had
gone
buell
obtained
permission
to
effect
this
change
of
base
the
whole
month
of
june
had
been
wasted
in
repairing
the
railway
with
a
view
to
halleck
faulty
plan
when
buell
himself
was
allowed
to
proceed
on
his
own
lines
and
was
approaching
chattanooga
his
communications
with
nashville
were
twice
in
the
middle
of
july
and
in
the
middle
of
august
cut
by
confederate
cavalry
raids
which
did
such
serious
damage
as
to
impose
great
delay
upon
him
in
the
end
of
august
and
beginning
of
september
kirby
smith
whose
army
had
been
strengthened
by
troops
transferred
from
beauregard
crossed
the
mountains
from
east
tennessee
by
passes
some
distance
northeast
of
chattanooga
and
invaded
kentucky
sending
detachments
to
threaten
louisville
on
the
indiana
border
of
kentucky
and
cincinnati
in
ohio
it
was
necessary
for
buell
to
retreat
when
after
a
week
or
more
of
uncertainty
it
became
clear
that
kirby
smith
main
force
was
committed
to
this
invasion
meanwhile
general
bragg
who
owing
to
the
illness
of
beauregard
had
succeeded
to
his
command
left
part
of
his
force
to
hold
grant
in
check
marched
with
the
remainder
to
support
kirby
smith
and
succeeded
in
placing
himself
between
buell
army
and
louisville
to
protect
which
from
kirby
smith
had
become
buell
first
object
it
seems
that
bragg
who
could
easily
have
been
reinforced
by
kirby
smith
had
now
an
opportunity
of
fighting
buell
with
great
advantage
but
the
confederate
generals
who
mistakenly
believed
that
kentucky
was
at
heart
with
them
saw
an
imaginary
political
gain
in
occupying
frankfort
the
state
capital
and
formally
setting
up
a
new
state
government
there
bragg
therefore
marched
on
to
join
kirby
smith
at
frankfort
which
was
well
to
the
east
of
buell
line
of
retreat
and
buell
was
able
to
reach
louisville
unopposed
by
september
these
events
were
watched
in
the
north
with
all
the
more
anxiety
because
the
confederate
invasion
of
kentucky
began
just
about
the
time
of
the
second
battle
of
bull
run
and
buell
arrived
at
louisville
within
a
week
after
the
battle
of
antietam
while
people
were
wondering
how
that
victory
would
be
followed
up
men
of
intelligence
and
influence
especially
in
the
western
states
were
loud
in
their
complaints
of
buell
want
of
vigour
it
is
remarkable
that
the
unionists
of
kentucky
who
suffered
the
most
through
his
supposed
faults
expressed
their
confidence
in
him
but
his
own
soldiers
did
not
like
him
for
he
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
without
either
tact
or
any
quality
which
much
impressed
them
their
reports
to
their
homes
in
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
from
which
they
mostly
came
increased
the
feeling
against
him
which
was
arising
in
those
states
and
his
relations
with
the
governors
of
ohio
and
indiana
who
were
busy
in
sending
him
recruits
and
whose
states
were
threatened
with
invasion
seem
wherever
the
fault
may
have
lain
to
have
been
unfortunate
buell
most
powerful
friend
had
been
mcclellan
and
by
an
irrational
but
unavoidable
process
of
thought
the
real
dilatoriness
of
mcclellan
became
an
argument
for
blaming
buell
as
well
halleck
defended
him
loyally
but
this
by
now
probably
seemed
to
lincoln
the
apology
of
one
irresolute
man
for
another
stanton
whose
efficiency
in
the
business
of
the
war
department
gave
him
great
weight
had
become
eager
for
the
removal
of
buell
lincoln
expected
that
as
soon
as
buell
could
cover
louisville
he
would
take
the
offensive
promptly
his
army
appears
to
have
exceeded
in
numbers
though
not
very
much
the
combined
forces
of
bragg
and
kirby
smith
and
except
as
to
cavalry
it
was
probably
as
good
in
quality
if
energetically
used
by
halleck
some
months
before
the
western
armies
should
have
been
strong
enough
to
accomplish
great
results
and
if
the
attempt
had
been
made
at
first
to
raise
much
larger
armies
it
seems
likely
that
the
difficulties
of
training
and
organisation
and
command
would
have
increased
out
of
proportion
to
any
gain
buell
remained
some
days
at
louisville
itself
receiving
reinforcements
which
were
considerable
but
consisted
mainly
of
raw
recruits
while
he
was
there
orders
arrived
from
lincoln
removing
him
and
appointing
his
second
in
command
the
virginian
thomas
in
his
place
this
was
a
wise
choice
thomas
was
one
of
the
four
northern
generals
who
won
abiding
distinction
in
the
civil
war
but
thomas
felt
the
injustice
which
was
done
to
buell
and
he
refused
the
command
in
a
letter
magnanimously
defending
him
the
fact
was
that
lincoln
had
rescinded
his
orders
before
they
were
received
for
he
had
issued
them
under
the
belief
that
buell
was
remaining
on
the
defensive
but
learnt
immediately
that
an
offensive
movement
was
in
progress
and
had
no
intention
of
changing
commanders
under
those
circumstances
on
october
a
battle
which
began
in
an
accidental
minor
conflict
took
place
between
buell
with
men
and
bragg
with
considerably
less
than
half
that
number
of
tried
veterans
buell
made
little
use
of
his
superior
numbers
for
which
the
fault
may
have
lain
with
the
corps
commander
who
first
became
engaged
and
who
did
not
report
at
once
to
him
the
part
of
buell
army
which
bore
the
brunt
of
the
fighting
suffered
heavy
losses
which
made
a
painful
impression
in
the
north
and
the
public
outcry
against
him
which
had
begun
as
soon
as
kentucky
was
invaded
by
the
confederates
now
increased
after
the
battle
bragg
fell
back
and
effected
a
junction
with
kirby
smith
their
joint
forces
were
not
very
far
inferior
to
buell
in
numbers
but
after
a
few
more
days
bragg
determined
to
evacuate
kentucky
in
which
his
hope
of
raising
many
recruits
had
been
disappointed
buell
on
perceiving
his
intention
pursued
him
some
distance
but
finding
the
roads
bad
for
the
movement
of
large
bodies
of
troops
finally
took
up
a
position
at
bowling
green
on
the
railway
to
the
north
of
nashville
intending
later
in
the
autumn
to
move
a
little
south
of
nashville
and
there
to
wait
for
the
spring
before
again
moving
on
chattanooga
he
was
urged
from
washington
to
press
forward
towards
chattanooga
at
once
but
replied
decidedly
that
he
was
unable
to
do
so
and
added
that
if
a
change
of
command
was
desired
the
present
was
a
suitable
time
for
it
at
the
end
of
october
he
was
removed
from
command
in
the
meantime
the
confederate
forces
that
had
been
left
to
oppose
grant
had
attacked
him
and
been
signally
defeated
in
two
engagements
in
each
of
which
general
rosecrans
who
was
serving
under
grant
was
in
immediate
command
on
the
northern
side
rosecrans
who
therefore
began
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
promising
general
and
indeed
was
one
of
those
who
in
the
chatter
of
the
time
were
occasionally
spoken
of
as
suitable
for
a
military
dictatorship
was
now
put
in
buell
place
which
thomas
had
once
refused
he
advanced
to
nashville
but
was
as
firm
as
buell
in
refusing
to
go
further
till
he
had
accumulated
rations
enough
to
make
him
for
a
time
independent
of
the
railway
ultimately
he
moved
on
murfreesborough
some
thirty
miles
further
in
the
direction
of
chattanooga
here
on
december
bragg
with
somewhat
inferior
numbers
attacked
him
and
gained
an
initial
success
which
rosecrans
and
his
subordinates
thomas
and
sheridan
were
able
to
prevent
him
from
making
good
bragg
losses
were
heavy
and
after
waiting
a
few
days
in
the
hope
that
rosecrans
might
retreat
first
he
fell
back
to
a
point
near
the
cumberland
mountains
a
little
in
advance
of
chattanooga
thus
the
battle
of
murfreesborough
counted
as
a
victory
to
the
north
a
slight
to
the
disaster
at
fredericksburg
a
little
while
before
but
it
had
no
very
striking
consequences
for
over
six
months
rosecrans
proceeded
no
further
the
northern
armies
remained
in
more
secure
possession
of
all
tennessee
west
of
the
mountains
than
they
had
obtained
in
the
first
half
of
but
the
length
of
their
communications
and
the
great
superiority
of
the
south
in
cavalry
which
could
threaten
those
communications
suspended
their
further
advance
lincoln
urged
that
their
army
could
subsist
on
the
country
which
it
invaded
but
buell
and
rosecrans
treated
the
idea
as
impracticable
in
fact
till
a
little
later
all
northern
generals
so
regarded
it
thus
chattanooga
which
it
was
hoped
would
be
occupied
soon
after
halleck
had
occupied
corinth
remained
in
southern
hands
for
more
than
a
year
after
that
notwithstanding
the
removal
of
buell
to
whom
this
disappointment
and
the
mortifying
invasion
of
kentucky
were
at
first
attributed
this
was
rightly
felt
to
be
unsatisfactory
but
the
chief
blame
that
can
now
be
imputed
falls
upon
the
mistakes
of
halleck
while
he
was
still
commanding
in
the
west
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
buell
had
any
exceptional
amount
of
intuition
or
of
energy
and
it
was
right
to
demand
that
a
general
with
both
these
qualities
should
be
appointed
if
he
could
be
found
but
he
was
at
least
a
prudent
officer
of
fair
capacity
doing
his
best
the
criticisms
upon
him
of
which
the
well
informed
were
lavish
were
uttered
without
appreciation
of
practical
difficulties
or
of
the
standard
by
which
he
was
really
to
be
judged
so
with
far
more
justice
than
mcclellan
he
has
been
numbered
among
the
misused
generals
lincoln
there
is
no
doubt
had
watched
his
proceedings
as
he
watched
those
of
rosecrans
after
him
with
a
feeling
of
impatience
and
set
him
down
as
unenterprising
and
obstinate
in
one
point
his
administration
was
much
to
blame
in
its
treatment
of
the
western
commanders
it
became
common
political
talk
that
the
way
to
get
victories
was
to
treat
unsuccessful
generals
almost
as
harshly
as
the
french
in
the
revolution
were
understood
to
have
treated
them
lincoln
did
not
go
thus
far
but
it
was
probably
with
his
authority
that
before
buell
was
removed
halleck
with
reluctance
on
his
own
part
wrote
a
letter
referring
to
this
prevalent
idea
and
calculated
to
put
about
among
the
western
commanders
an
expectation
that
whichever
of
them
first
did
something
notable
would
be
put
over
his
less
successful
colleagues
later
on
and
as
we
can
hardly
doubt
with
lincoln
consent
grant
and
rosecrans
were
each
informed
that
the
first
of
them
to
win
a
victory
would
get
the
vacant
in
the
united
states
army
in
place
of
his
present
volunteer
rank
this
was
not
the
way
to
handle
men
with
proper
professional
pride
and
it
is
one
of
those
cases
which
are
strangely
few
where
lincoln
made
the
sort
of
mistake
that
might
have
been
expected
from
his
want
of
training
and
not
from
his
native
generosity
but
in
the
main
his
treatment
of
this
difficult
question
was
sound
sharing
as
he
did
the
prevailing
impatience
with
buell
he
had
no
intention
of
yielding
to
it
till
there
was
a
real
prospect
that
a
change
of
generals
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
when
the
appointment
of
thomas
was
proposed
there
really
was
such
a
prospect
when
rosecrans
was
eventually
put
in
buell
place
the
result
was
disappointing
to
lincoln
but
it
was
evidently
not
a
bad
appointment
and
a
situation
had
then
arisen
in
which
it
would
have
been
folly
to
retain
buell
if
any
capable
successor
to
him
could
be
found
for
the
governors
of
indiana
ohio
and
illinois
of
whom
the
first
named
was
reputed
the
ablest
of
the
war
governors
in
the
west
and
on
whom
his
army
depended
for
recruits
now
combined
in
representations
against
him
which
could
not
be
ignored
lincoln
who
could
not
have
personal
acquaintance
with
the
generals
of
the
western
armies
as
he
had
with
those
in
the
east
was
it
should
be
observed
throughout
unceasing
in
his
efforts
to
get
the
fullest
and
clearest
impression
of
them
that
he
could
he
was
always
as
it
has
been
put
taking
measurements
of
men
and
a
good
deal
of
what
seemed
idle
and
gossipy
talk
with
chance
visitors
who
could
tell
him
little
incidents
or
give
him
new
impressions
seems
to
have
had
this
serious
purpose
for
the
first
half
of
the
war
the
choice
of
men
for
high
commands
was
the
most
harassing
of
all
the
difficulties
of
his
administration
there
is
no
doubt
of
his
constant
watchfulness
to
discern
and
promote
merit
he
was
certainly
beset
by
the
feeling
that
generals
were
apt
to
be
wanting
in
the
vigour
and
boldness
which
the
conduct
of
the
war
demanded
but
though
this
in
some
cases
probably
misled
him
upon
the
whole
there
was
good
reason
for
it
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
considered
that
all
this
while
he
knew
himself
to
be
losing
influence
through
his
supposed
want
of
energy
in
the
war
and
that
he
was
under
strong
and
unceasing
pressure
from
every
influential
quarter
to
dismiss
every
general
who
caused
disappointment
newspapers
and
private
letters
of
the
time
demonstrate
that
there
was
intense
impatience
against
him
for
not
producing
victorious
generals
this
being
so
his
own
patience
in
this
matter
and
his
resolution
to
give
those
under
him
a
fair
chance
appear
very
remarkable
and
were
certainly
very
wise
we
have
come
however
to
the
end
not
of
all
the
clamour
against
lincoln
but
of
his
own
worst
perplexities
in
passing
to
the
operations
further
west
we
are
passing
to
an
instance
in
which
lincoln
felt
it
right
to
stand
to
the
end
by
a
decried
commander
and
that
decried
commander
proved
to
possess
the
very
qualities
for
which
he
had
vainly
looked
in
others
the
reverse
side
of
general
grant
fame
is
well
enough
known
to
the
world
before
the
war
he
had
been
living
under
a
cloud
in
the
autumn
of
while
his
army
lay
between
corinth
and
memphis
the
cloud
still
rested
on
his
reputation
in
spite
of
the
glory
he
had
won
for
a
moment
at
fort
donelson
large
circles
were
ready
to
speak
of
him
simply
as
an
incompetent
and
disagreeable
man
the
crowning
work
of
his
life
was
accomplished
with
terrible
bloodshed
which
was
often
attributed
to
callousness
and
incapacity
on
his
part
the
eight
years
of
his
presidency
afterwards
which
can
not
properly
be
discussed
here
added
at
the
best
no
lustre
to
his
memory
later
still
when
he
visited
europe
as
a
celebrity
the
general
impression
which
he
created
seems
to
be
contained
in
the
words
a
rude
man
thus
the
grant
that
we
discover
in
the
recollections
of
a
few
loyal
and
loving
friends
and
in
the
memoirs
which
he
himself
began
when
late
in
life
he
lost
his
money
and
which
he
finished
with
the
pains
of
death
upon
him
is
a
surprising
in
some
ways
pathetic
figure
he
had
been
a
shy
country
boy
ready
enough
at
all
the
work
of
a
farm
and
good
with
horses
but
with
none
of
the
business
aptitude
that
make
a
successful
farmer
when
his
father
made
him
go
to
west
point
here
he
showed
no
great
promise
and
made
few
friends
his
health
became
delicate
and
he
wanted
to
leave
the
army
and
become
a
teacher
of
mathematics
but
the
mexican
war
one
of
the
most
unjust
in
all
history
as
he
afterwards
said
broke
out
and
so
he
later
thought
saved
his
life
from
consumption
by
keeping
him
in
the
open
air
after
that
he
did
retire
failed
at
farming
and
other
ventures
and
at
when
the
civil
war
began
was
as
has
been
seen
a
shiftless
fellow
pretty
far
gone
in
the
habit
of
drink
and
more
or
less
occupied
about
a
leather
business
of
his
father
rough
in
appearance
and
in
manner
he
remained
the
very
opposite
of
smart
the
very
opposite
of
versatile
the
very
opposite
of
expansive
in
speech
or
social
intercourse
unlike
many
rough
people
he
had
a
really
simple
character
truthful
modest
and
kind
without
varied
interests
or
complicated
emotions
or
much
sense
of
fun
but
thinking
intensely
on
the
problems
that
he
did
see
before
him
and
in
his
silent
way
keenly
sensitive
on
most
of
the
points
on
which
it
is
well
to
be
sensitive
his
friends
reckoned
up
the
very
few
occasions
on
which
he
was
ever
seen
to
be
angry
only
one
could
be
recalled
on
which
he
was
angry
on
his
own
account
the
cruelty
of
a
driver
to
animals
in
his
supply
train
heartless
neglect
in
carrying
out
the
arrangements
he
had
made
for
the
comfort
of
the
sick
and
wounded
these
were
the
sort
of
occasions
which
broke
down
grant
habitual
and
good
temper
he
was
never
too
anxious
wrote
chaplain
eaton
who
having
been
set
by
him
in
charge
of
the
negro
refugees
with
his
army
had
excellent
means
of
judging
never
too
preoccupied
with
the
great
problems
that
beset
him
to
take
a
sincere
and
humane
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
most
subordinate
labourer
dependent
upon
him
and
he
had
delicacy
of
feeling
in
other
ways
once
in
the
crowd
at
some
hotel
in
which
he
mingled
an
undistinguished
figure
an
old
officer
under
him
tried
on
a
lecherous
story
for
the
entertainment
of
the
general
who
did
not
look
the
sort
of
man
to
resent
it
grant
who
did
not
wish
to
set
down
an
older
man
roughly
and
had
no
ready
phrases
but
had
as
it
happens
a
sensitive
skin
was
observed
to
blush
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
in
exquisite
discomfort
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
little
recorded
traits
of
this
somewhat
unexpected
kind
which
give
grace
to
the
memory
of
his
determination
in
a
duty
which
became
very
grim
the
simplicity
of
character
as
well
as
manner
which
endeared
him
to
a
few
close
associates
was
probably
a
very
poor
equipment
for
the
presidency
which
from
that
very
simplicity
he
afterwards
treated
as
his
due
and
grant
presented
in
some
ways
as
great
a
contrast
as
can
be
imagined
to
the
large
and
complex
mind
of
lincoln
but
he
was
the
man
that
lincoln
had
yearned
for
whatever
degree
of
military
skill
may
be
ascribed
to
him
he
had
in
the
fullest
measure
the
moral
attributes
of
a
commander
the
sense
that
the
war
could
be
put
through
and
must
be
put
through
possessed
his
soul
he
was
insusceptible
to
personal
danger
at
least
so
observers
said
though
he
himself
told
a
different
story
and
he
taught
himself
to
keep
a
quiet
mind
in
the
presence
of
losses
rout
in
battle
or
failure
in
a
campaign
it
was
said
that
he
never
troubled
himself
with
fancies
as
to
what
the
enemy
might
be
doing
and
he
confessed
to
having
constantly
told
himself
that
the
enemy
was
as
much
afraid
of
him
as
he
of
the
enemy
his
military
talent
was
doubled
in
efficacy
by
his
indomitable
constancy
in
one
sense
moreover
and
that
a
wholly
good
sense
he
was
a
political
general
for
he
had
constantly
before
his
mind
the
aims
of
the
government
which
employed
him
perceiving
early
that
there
were
only
two
possible
ends
to
the
war
the
complete
subjugation
of
the
south
or
the
complete
failure
of
the
union
perceiving
also
that
there
was
no
danger
of
exhausting
the
resources
of
the
north
and
great
danger
of
discouraging
its
spirit
while
the
position
of
the
south
was
in
this
respect
the
precise
contrary
he
was
therefore
the
better
able
to
serve
the
state
as
a
soldier
because
throughout
he
measured
by
a
just
standard
the
ulterior
good
or
harm
of
success
or
failure
in
his
enterprises
the
affectionate
confidence
which
existed
between
lee
and
stonewall
jackson
till
the
latter
was
killed
at
chancellorsville
had
a
parallel
in
the
endearing
friendship
which
sprung
up
between
grant
and
his
principal
subordinate
william
sherman
who
was
to
bear
a
hardly
less
momentous
part
than
his
own
in
the
conclusion
of
the
war
sherman
was
a
man
of
quick
wits
and
fancy
bright
and
mercurial
disposition
capable
of
being
a
delightful
companion
to
children
and
capable
of
being
sharp
and
inconsiderate
to
duller
subordinates
it
is
a
high
tribute
both
to
this
brilliant
soldier
and
to
grant
himself
that
he
always
regarded
grant
as
having
made
him
not
only
by
his
confidence
but
by
his
example
as
has
been
said
grant
was
required
to
remain
on
the
defensive
between
memphis
and
corinth
which
mark
the
line
of
the
northern
frontier
at
this
period
while
buell
was
advancing
on
chattanooga
later
while
the
confederates
were
invading
kentucky
further
east
attacks
were
also
directed
against
grant
to
keep
him
quiet
these
were
defeated
though
grant
was
unable
to
follow
up
his
success
at
the
time
when
the
invasion
of
kentucky
had
collapsed
and
the
confederates
under
bragg
were
retreating
before
buell
and
his
successor
out
of
middle
tennessee
it
became
possible
for
grant
and
for
halleck
and
the
government
at
washington
to
look
to
completing
the
conquest
of
the
mississippi
river
the
importance
to
the
confederates
of
a
hold
upon
the
mississippi
has
been
pointed
out
if
it
were
lost
the
whole
of
far
would
manifestly
be
lost
with
it
in
the
north
on
the
other
hand
public
sentiment
was
strongly
set
upon
freeing
the
navigation
of
the
great
river
the
confederacy
now
held
the
river
from
the
fortress
of
vicksburg
which
after
taking
new
orleans
admiral
farragut
had
attacked
in
vain
down
to
port
hudson
miles
further
south
where
the
confederate
forces
had
since
then
seized
and
fortified
another
point
of
vantage
vicksburg
it
will
be
observed
lies
to
miles
south
of
memphis
or
from
grand
junction
between
memphis
and
corinth
the
points
in
the
occupation
of
the
north
which
must
serve
grant
as
a
base
at
vicksburg
itself
and
for
some
distance
south
of
it
a
line
of
bluffs
or
hills
lying
east
of
the
mississippi
comes
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
river
the
river
as
it
approaches
these
bluffs
makes
a
sudden
bend
to
the
and
then
again
to
the
so
that
two
successive
reaches
of
the
stream
each
from
three
to
four
miles
long
were
commanded
by
the
vicksburg
guns
feet
above
the
valley
the
eastward
or
landward
side
of
the
fortress
was
also
well
situated
for
defence
to
the
north
of
vicksburg
the
country
on
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
is
cut
up
by
innumerable
streams
and
bayous
or
marshy
creeks
winding
and
intersecting
amid
a
dense
growth
of
cedars
the
north
with
a
flotilla
under
admiral
porter
commanded
the
mississippi
itself
and
the
northern
forces
could
freely
move
along
its
western
shore
to
the
impregnable
river
face
of
vicksburg
beyond
but
the
question
of
how
to
get
safely
to
the
assailable
side
of
vicksburg
presented
formidable
difficulty
to
grant
and
to
the
government
grant
operations
began
in
november
advancing
directly
southward
along
the
railway
from
memphis
with
the
bulk
of
his
forces
he
after
a
while
detached
sherman
with
a
force
which
proceeded
down
the
mississippi
to
the
mouth
of
the
yazoo
a
little
of
vicksburg
here
sherman
was
to
land
and
it
was
hoped
surprise
the
enemy
at
vicksburg
itself
while
the
bulk
of
the
enemy
forces
were
fully
occupied
by
grant
advance
from
the
north
but
grant
lengthening
communications
were
cut
up
by
a
cavalry
raid
and
he
had
to
retreat
while
sherman
came
upon
an
enemy
fully
prepared
and
sustained
a
defeat
a
fortnight
after
burnside
defeat
at
fredericksburg
this
was
the
first
of
a
long
series
of
failures
during
which
grant
who
for
his
part
was
conspicuously
frank
and
loyal
in
his
relations
with
the
government
received
upon
the
whole
the
fullest
confidence
and
support
from
them
there
occurred
however
about
this
time
an
incident
which
was
trying
to
grant
and
of
which
the
very
simple
facts
must
be
stated
since
it
was
the
last
of
the
occasions
upon
which
severe
criticism
of
lincoln
military
administration
has
been
founded
general
mcclernand
was
an
ambitious
illinois
of
energy
and
courage
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
lincoln
and
an
old
opponent
since
the
death
of
douglas
he
and
another
logan
had
been
the
most
powerful
of
the
democrats
in
illinois
both
were
zealous
in
the
war
and
had
joined
the
army
upon
its
outbreak
logan
served
as
a
general
under
grant
with
confessed
ability
it
must
be
repeated
that
north
and
south
former
civilians
had
to
be
placed
in
command
for
lack
of
enough
soldiers
of
known
capacity
to
go
round
and
that
many
of
them
like
logan
and
like
the
southern
general
polk
who
was
a
bishop
in
the
american
episcopal
church
did
very
good
service
mcclernand
had
early
obtained
high
rank
and
had
shown
no
sign
as
yet
of
having
less
aptitude
for
his
new
career
than
other
men
of
similar
antecedents
grant
however
distrusted
him
and
proved
to
be
right
in
october
mcclernand
came
to
lincoln
with
an
offer
of
his
personal
services
in
raising
troops
from
illinois
indiana
and
iowa
with
a
special
view
to
clearing
the
mississippi
he
of
course
expected
to
be
himself
employed
in
this
operation
recruiting
was
at
a
low
ebb
and
it
would
have
been
folly
to
slight
this
offer
mcclernand
did
in
fact
raise
volunteers
to
the
number
of
a
whole
army
corps
he
was
placed
under
grant
in
command
of
the
expedition
down
the
mississippi
which
had
already
started
under
sherman
sherman
great
promise
had
not
yet
been
proved
to
any
one
but
grant
he
appears
at
this
time
to
have
come
under
the
disapproval
of
the
joint
committee
of
congress
on
the
war
and
the
newspaper
press
had
not
long
before
announced
with
affected
regret
the
news
that
he
had
become
insane
mcclernand
arriving
just
after
sherman
defeat
near
vicksburg
fell
in
at
once
with
a
suggestion
of
his
to
attack
the
post
of
arkansas
a
confederate
stronghold
in
the
state
of
arkansas
and
upon
the
river
of
that
name
from
the
shelter
of
which
confederate
gunboats
had
some
chance
of
raiding
the
mississippi
above
vicksburg
the
expedition
succeeded
in
this
early
in
january
and
was
then
recalled
to
join
grant
this
was
a
mortification
to
mcclernand
who
had
hoped
for
a
command
independent
of
grant
in
his
subsequent
conduct
he
seems
to
have
shown
incapacity
he
was
certainly
insubordinate
to
grant
and
he
busied
himself
in
intrigues
against
him
with
such
result
as
will
soon
be
seen
as
soon
as
grant
told
the
administration
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
mcclernand
he
was
assured
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
remove
him
from
command
this
he
eventually
did
after
some
months
of
trial
in
the
first
three
months
of
while
the
army
of
the
potomac
shattered
at
fredericksburg
was
being
prepared
for
the
fresh
attack
upon
lee
which
ended
at
chancellorsville
and
while
bragg
and
rosecrans
lay
confronting
each
other
in
middle
tennessee
each
content
that
the
other
was
afraid
to
weaken
himself
by
sending
troops
to
the
mississippi
grant
was
occupied
in
a
series
of
enterprises
apparently
more
cautious
than
that
in
which
he
eventually
succeeded
but
each
in
its
turn
futile
an
attempt
was
made
to
render
vicksburg
useless
by
a
canal
cutting
across
the
bend
of
the
mississippi
to
the
west
of
that
fortress
then
grant
endeavoured
with
the
able
of
admiral
porter
and
his
flotilla
to
secure
a
safe
landing
on
the
yazoo
which
enters
the
mississippi
a
little
above
vicksburg
so
that
he
could
move
his
army
to
the
rear
of
vicksburg
by
this
route
next
grant
and
porter
tried
to
establish
a
sure
line
of
water
communication
from
a
point
far
up
the
mississippi
through
an
old
canal
then
somehow
obstructed
into
the
upper
waters
of
the
yazoo
and
so
to
a
point
on
that
river
or
miles
to
the
of
vicksburg
by
which
they
would
have
turned
the
right
of
the
main
confederate
force
but
this
was
frustrated
by
the
confederates
who
succeeded
in
establishing
a
strong
fort
further
up
the
yazoo
yet
a
further
effort
was
made
to
establish
a
waterway
by
a
canal
quitting
the
mississippi
about
miles
north
of
vicksburg
and
communicating
through
lakes
bayous
and
smaller
rivers
with
its
great
tributary
the
red
river
far
to
the
south
this
like
the
first
canal
attempted
would
have
rendered
vicksburg
useless
each
of
these
projects
failed
in
turn
the
tedious
engineering
work
which
two
of
them
involved
was
rendered
more
depressing
by
adverse
conditions
of
weather
and
by
among
grant
men
natural
grumbling
among
the
troops
was
repeated
and
exaggerated
in
the
north
mcclernand
employed
the
gift
for
intrigue
which
perhaps
had
helped
him
to
secure
his
command
in
an
effort
to
get
grant
removed
it
is
melancholy
to
add
that
a
good
many
newspapers
at
this
time
began
to
print
statements
that
grant
had
again
taken
to
drink
it
is
certain
that
he
was
at
this
time
a
total
abstainer
it
is
said
that
he
had
offended
the
authors
of
this
villainy
by
the
restrictions
which
he
had
long
before
found
necessary
to
put
upon
information
to
the
press
some
of
the
men
freely
confessed
afterwards
that
they
had
been
convinced
of
his
sobriety
and
added
the
marvellous
apology
that
their
business
was
to
give
the
public
the
news
able
and
more
honest
journalists
urged
that
grant
had
proved
his
incompetence
secretary
chase
took
up
their
complaints
and
pressed
that
grant
should
be
removed
lincoln
before
the
outcry
against
grant
had
risen
to
its
height
had
felt
the
need
of
closer
information
than
he
possessed
about
the
situation
on
the
mississippi
and
had
hit
upon
the
happy
expedient
of
sending
an
able
official
of
the
war
department
who
deserved
and
obtained
the
confidence
of
grant
and
his
officers
to
accompany
the
western
army
and
report
to
him
apart
however
from
the
reports
he
thus
received
he
had
always
treated
the
attacks
on
grant
with
contempt
i
can
not
spare
this
general
he
fights
he
said
in
reply
to
complaints
that
grant
drank
he
enquired
adapting
as
he
knew
george
ii
famous
saying
about
wolfe
what
whisky
he
drank
explaining
that
he
wished
to
send
barrels
of
it
to
some
of
his
other
generals
his
attitude
is
remarkable
because
in
his
own
mind
he
had
not
thought
well
of
any
of
grant
plans
after
his
first
failure
in
december
he
had
himself
wished
from
an
early
day
that
grant
would
take
the
very
course
by
which
he
ultimately
succeeded
he
let
him
go
his
own
way
as
he
afterwards
told
him
from
a
general
hope
that
you
know
better
than
i
at
the
end
of
march
grant
took
a
memorable
determination
to
transfer
his
whole
force
to
the
south
of
vicksburg
and
approach
it
from
that
direction
he
was
urged
by
sherman
to
give
up
any
further
attempt
to
use
the
river
and
instead
to
bring
his
whole
army
back
to
memphis
and
begin
a
necessarily
slow
approach
on
vicksburg
by
the
railway
he
declared
himself
that
on
ordinary
grounds
of
military
prudence
this
would
have
been
the
proper
course
but
he
decided
for
himself
that
the
depressing
effect
of
the
retreat
to
memphis
would
be
politically
disastrous
at
grand
gulf
miles
south
of
vicksburg
the
south
possessed
another
fortified
post
on
the
river
to
reach
this
grant
required
the
help
of
the
navy
not
only
in
crossing
from
the
western
bank
of
the
river
but
in
transporting
the
supplies
for
which
the
roads
west
of
the
river
were
inadequate
admiral
porter
with
his
gunboats
and
laden
barges
successfully
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
vicksburg
batteries
by
night
without
serious
damage
grand
gulf
was
taken
on
may
and
army
established
at
this
new
base
a
further
doubt
now
arose
general
banks
in
louisiana
was
at
this
time
preparing
to
besiege
port
hudson
it
might
be
well
for
grant
to
go
south
and
join
him
and
after
reducing
port
hudson
return
with
banks
forces
against
vicksburg
this
was
what
now
commended
itself
to
lincoln
in
the
letter
of
congratulation
which
some
time
later
he
was
able
to
send
to
grant
after
referring
to
his
former
opinion
which
had
been
right
he
confessed
that
he
had
now
been
wrong
banks
was
not
yet
ready
to
move
and
vicksburg
now
seriously
threatened
might
soon
be
reinforced
orders
to
join
banks
though
they
were
probably
meant
to
be
discretionary
were
actually
sent
to
grant
but
too
late
he
had
cut
himself
loose
from
his
base
at
grand
gulf
and
marched
his
troops
north
to
live
with
great
hardship
to
themselves
on
the
country
and
the
supplies
they
could
take
with
them
he
had
with
him
men
general
pemberton
to
whom
he
had
so
far
been
opposed
lay
covering
vicksburg
with
and
a
further
force
in
the
city
joseph
johnston
whom
he
afterwards
described
as
the
southern
general
who
in
all
the
war
gave
him
most
trouble
had
been
sent
by
jefferson
davis
to
take
supreme
command
in
the
west
and
had
collected
men
at
jackson
the
capital
of
mississippi
miles
east
of
vicksburg
grant
was
able
to
take
his
enemy
in
detail
having
broken
up
johnston
force
he
defeated
pemberton
in
a
series
of
battles
his
victory
at
champion
hill
on
may
not
a
fortnight
after
chancellorsville
conveyed
to
his
mind
the
assurance
that
the
north
would
win
the
war
an
assault
on
vicksburg
failed
with
heavy
loss
pemberton
was
at
last
closely
invested
in
vicksburg
and
grant
could
establish
safe
communications
with
the
north
by
way
of
the
lower
yazoo
and
up
the
mississippi
above
its
mouth
there
had
been
dissension
between
pemberton
and
johnston
who
seeing
that
gunboats
proved
able
to
pass
vicksburg
in
any
case
thought
that
pemberton
whom
he
could
not
at
the
moment
hope
to
relieve
should
abandon
vicksburg
and
try
to
save
his
army
long
before
johnston
could
be
sufficiently
reinforced
to
attack
grant
grant
force
had
been
raised
to
on
july
the
day
of
the
annual
commemoration
of
national
independence
vicksburg
was
surrendered
its
garrison
who
had
suffered
severely
were
well
victualled
by
grant
and
allowed
to
go
free
on
parole
pemberton
in
his
vexation
treated
grant
with
peculiar
insolence
which
provoked
a
singular
exhibition
of
the
conqueror
good
temper
to
him
and
in
his
despatches
to
the
president
grant
mentioned
nothing
with
greater
pride
than
the
absence
of
a
word
or
a
sign
on
the
part
of
his
men
which
could
hurt
the
feelings
of
the
fallen
johnston
was
forced
to
abandon
the
town
of
jackson
with
its
large
stores
to
sherman
but
could
not
be
pursued
in
his
retreat
on
july
five
days
later
the
defender
of
port
hudson
invested
shortly
before
by
banks
who
had
not
force
enough
for
an
assault
heard
the
news
of
vicksburg
and
surrendered
lincoln
could
now
boast
to
the
north
that
the
father
of
waters
again
goes
unvexed
to
the
sea
at
the
very
hour
when
vicksburg
was
surrendered
lincoln
had
been
issuing
the
news
of
another
victory
won
in
the
preceding
three
days
which
along
with
the
capture
of
vicksburg
marked
the
turning
point
of
the
war
for
more
than
a
month
after
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
the
two
opposing
armies
in
the
east
had
lain
inactive
the
conscription
law
with
which
we
must
deal
later
had
recently
been
passed
and
various
elements
of
discontent
and
disloyalty
in
the
north
showed
a
great
deal
of
activity
it
seems
that
jefferson
davis
at
first
saw
no
political
advantage
in
the
military
risk
of
invading
the
north
lee
thought
otherwise
and
was
eager
to
follow
up
his
success
at
last
early
in
june
he
started
northward
this
time
he
aimed
at
the
great
industrial
regions
of
pennsylvania
hoping
also
while
assailing
them
to
draw
hooker
further
from
washington
hooker
on
first
learning
that
lee
had
crossed
the
rappahannock
entertained
the
thought
of
himself
going
south
of
it
and
attacking
richmond
lincoln
dissuaded
him
since
he
might
be
entangled
upon
the
river
like
an
ox
jumped
half
over
a
fence
he
could
not
take
richmond
for
weeks
and
his
communications
might
be
cut
besides
lincoln
added
his
true
objective
point
throughout
was
lee
army
and
not
richmond
hooker
later
movements
in
conformity
with
what
he
could
gather
of
lee
movements
were
prudent
and
skilful
he
rejected
a
later
suggestion
of
lincoln
that
he
should
strike
quickly
at
the
most
assailable
point
in
lee
lengthening
line
of
communications
and
he
was
wise
for
lee
could
live
on
the
country
he
was
traversing
and
hooker
now
aimed
at
covering
philadelphia
or
baltimore
and
washington
according
to
the
direction
which
lee
might
take
watching
all
the
while
for
the
moment
to
strike
he
found
himself
hampered
in
some
details
by
probably
injudicious
orders
of
his
superior
halleck
and
became
irritable
and
querulous
lincoln
had
to
exercise
his
simple
arts
to
keep
him
to
his
duty
and
to
soothe
him
and
was
for
the
moment
successful
suddenly
on
june
with
a
battle
in
near
prospect
hooker
sent
in
his
resignation
probably
he
meant
it
but
there
was
no
time
to
debate
the
matter
probably
he
had
lost
confidence
in
himself
as
he
did
before
at
chancellorsville
lincoln
evidently
judged
that
his
state
of
mind
made
it
wise
to
accept
this
resignation
he
promptly
appointed
in
place
one
of
his
subordinates
general
george
meade
a
lean
tall
studious
somewhat
man
not
brilliant
or
popular
or
the
choice
that
the
army
would
have
expected
but
with
a
record
in
previous
campaigns
which
made
him
seem
to
lincoln
trustworthy
as
he
was
a
subordinate
command
in
which
he
could
really
distinguish
himself
was
later
found
for
hooker
who
now
took
leave
of
his
army
in
words
of
marked
generosity
towards
meade
all
this
while
there
was
great
excitement
in
the
north
urgent
demands
had
been
raised
for
the
recall
of
mcclellan
a
course
of
which
lincoln
justly
observed
no
one
could
measure
the
inconvenience
so
well
as
he
lee
was
now
feeling
his
way
somewhat
in
the
dark
as
to
his
movements
because
he
had
despatched
most
of
his
cavalry
upon
raiding
expeditions
towards
the
important
industrial
centre
of
harrisburg
meade
continued
on
a
parallel
course
to
him
with
his
army
spread
out
to
guard
against
any
movements
of
lee
to
the
eastward
each
commander
would
have
preferred
to
fight
the
other
upon
the
defensive
suddenly
on
july
three
days
after
meade
had
taken
command
a
chance
collision
took
place
north
of
the
town
of
gettysburg
between
the
advance
guards
of
the
two
armies
it
developed
into
a
general
engagement
of
which
the
result
must
partly
depend
on
the
speed
with
which
each
commander
could
bring
up
the
remainder
of
his
army
on
the
first
day
lee
achieved
a
decided
success
the
northern
troops
were
driven
back
upon
steep
heights
just
south
of
gettysburg
of
which
the
contour
made
it
difficult
for
the
enemy
to
his
movements
in
any
attack
on
them
here
meade
who
when
the
battle
began
was
ten
miles
away
and
did
not
expect
it
was
able
by
the
morning
of
the
or
during
that
day
to
bring
up
his
full
force
and
here
contrary
to
his
original
choice
of
a
position
for
bringing
on
a
battle
he
made
his
stand
the
attack
planned
by
lee
on
the
following
day
must
in
his
opinion
afterwards
have
been
successful
if
stonewall
jackson
had
been
alive
and
with
him
as
it
was
his
most
brilliant
remaining
subordinate
longstreet
disapproved
of
any
assault
and
on
this
and
the
following
day
obeyed
his
orders
reluctantly
and
too
slowly
on
july
lee
renewed
his
attack
in
previous
battles
the
northern
troops
had
been
contending
with
invisible
enemies
in
woods
now
after
a
heavy
cannonade
the
whole
southern
line
could
be
seen
advancing
in
the
open
to
a
desperate
assault
this
attack
was
crushed
by
the
northern
fire
first
and
last
in
the
fighting
round
gettysburg
the
north
lost
out
of
about
men
and
the
south
about
an
equal
number
out
of
the
net
result
was
that
after
a
day
delay
lee
felt
compelled
to
retreat
nothing
but
an
actual
victory
would
have
made
it
wise
for
him
to
persist
in
his
adventurous
invasion
the
importance
of
this
which
has
been
remembered
as
the
chief
battle
of
the
war
must
be
estimated
rather
by
the
peril
from
which
the
north
was
delivered
than
by
the
results
it
immediately
reaped
neither
on
july
nor
during
lee
subsequent
retreat
did
meade
follow
up
his
advantage
with
the
boldness
to
which
lincoln
in
the
midst
of
his
congratulations
exhorted
him
on
july
lee
recrossed
the
potomac
meade
on
the
day
before
had
thought
of
attacking
him
but
desisted
on
the
advice
of
the
majority
in
a
council
of
war
that
council
of
war
as
lincoln
said
should
never
have
been
held
its
decision
was
demonstrably
wrong
since
it
rested
on
the
hope
that
lee
would
himself
attack
lincoln
writhed
at
a
phrase
in
meade
general
orders
about
driving
the
invader
from
our
soil
will
our
generals
he
exclaimed
in
private
never
get
that
idea
out
of
their
heads
the
whole
country
is
our
soil
meade
however
unlike
mcclellan
was
only
cautious
not
lukewarm
nor
without
a
mind
of
his
own
the
army
opposed
to
him
was
much
larger
than
that
which
mcclellan
failed
to
overwhelm
after
antietam
he
had
offered
to
resign
when
he
inferred
lincoln
dissatisfaction
from
a
telegram
lincoln
refused
this
and
made
it
clear
through
another
officer
that
his
strong
opinion
as
to
what
might
have
been
done
did
not
imply
ingratitude
or
want
of
confidence
towards
a
brave
and
skilful
officer
and
a
true
man
characteristically
he
relieved
his
sense
of
meade
omissions
in
a
letter
of
most
lucid
criticism
and
characteristically
he
never
sent

to

as

retreated
succeeded
in
getting
false
reports
as
to

the
condition
of

conveyed
to

accordingly
followed

up
in
an
incautious
manner
by

the

of

important

while

one
part
of

at

was
brought
back
to

over

into

tennessee
which
lincoln
had
so
long
desired
for
the
relief
of
the
unionists
there
and
he
was
able
to
hold
his
ground
defeating
at
knoxville
a
little
later
an
expedition
under
longstreet
which
was
sent
to
dislodge
him
other
portions
of
the
western
army
were
at
last
ordered
to
join
rosecrans
but
did
not
reach
him
before
he
had
met
with
disaster
for
the
confederate
authorities
eager
to
retrieve
their
losses
sent
every
available
reinforcement
to
bragg
and
he
was
shortly
able
to
turn
back
towards
chattanooga
with
over
men
against
the
with
which
rosecrans
scattering
his
troops
in
false
security
was
pursuing
him

upon

the
battle
fought
among

only
an

gallant

prevented
bragg
from
turning
the
hasty
retirement
of
the
remainder
into
a
disastrous
rout
as
it
was
rosecrans
made
good
his
retreat
to

but
there
he
was
in
danger
of
being
completely
cut

promptly
detached

he
had

to

marked
by
notable

which
the

and

himself
had
regarded
as
impregnable

ended
in
a
rout
of
the
confederates
which
was
energetically
followed
up
bragg
army
was
broken
and
driven
right
back
into
georgia
to
sum
up
the
events
of
the
year
the
one
serious
invasion
of
the
north
by
the
south
had
failed
and
the
dominion
on
which
the
confederacy
had
any
real
hold
was
now
restricted
to
the
atlantic
states
alabama
and
a
part
of
the
state
of
mississippi
at
this
point
at
which
the
issue
of
the
war
if
it
were
only
pursued
could
not
be
doubted
and
at
which
as
it
happens
the
need
of
personal
intervention
in
military
matters
became
greatly
diminished
we
may
try
to
obtain
a
general
impression
of
his
wisdom
or
want
of
it
in
such
affairs
the
closeness
and
keen
intelligence
with
which
he
followed
the
war
is
undoubted
but
could
only
be
demonstrated
by
a
lengthy
accumulation
of
evidence
the
larger
strategy
of
the
north
sound
in
the
main
was
of
course
the
product
of
more
than
one
mind
but
as
his
was
undoubtedly
the
dominant
will
of
his
administration
so
too
it
seems
likely
that
with
his
early
and
sustained
grasp
of
the
general
problem
he
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
clearness
and
consistency
of
the
strategical
plans
the
amount
of
the
forces
raised
was
for
long
as
we
shall
see
later
beyond
his
control
and
in
the
distribution
of
what
he
had
to
the
best
effect
his
own
want
of
knowledge
and
the
poor
judgment
of
his
earlier
advisers
seem
to
have
caused
some
errors
he
started
with
the
evident
desire
to
put
himself
almost
unreservedly
in
the
hands
of
the
competent
military
counsellors
and
he
was
able
in
the
end
to
do
so
but
for
a
long
intermediate
period
as
we
have
seen
he
was
compelled
as
a
responsible
statesman
to
forego
this
wish
it
was
all
that
time
his
function
first
to
pick
out
with
very
little
to
go
by
the
best
officers
he
could
find
replacing
them
with
better
when
he
could
and
secondly
to
give
them
just
so
much
direction
and
no
more
as
his
wisdom
at
a
distance
and
their
more
expert
skill
upon
the
spot
made
proper
in
each
of
these
respects
his
occasional
mistakes
are
plain
enough
but
the
evidence
upon
which
he
has
often
been
thought
capable
of
setting
aside
sound
military
considerations
causelessly
or
in
obedience
to
interested
pressure
breaks
down
when
the
facts
of
any
imputed
instance
are
known
it
is
manifest
that
he
gained
rapidly
both
in
knowledge
of
the
men
he
dealt
with
and
in
the
firm
kindness
with
which
he
treated
them
it
is
remarkable
that
with
his
desire
to
see
vigour
and
ability
displayed
he
could
watch
so
constantly
as
he
did
for
the
precise
opportunity
or
the
urgent
necessity
before
he
made
changes
in
command
it
is
equally
remarkable
that
with
his
decided
and
often
right
views
as
to
what
should
be
done
his
advice
was
always
offered
with
equal
deference
and
plainness
quite
possibly
i
was
wrong
both
then
and
now
he
once
wrote
to
hooker
but
in
the
great
responsibility
resting
upon
me
i
can
not
be
entirely
silent
now
all
i
ask
is
that
you
will
be
in
such
mood
that
we
can
get
into
action
the
best
cordial
judgment
of
yourself
and
general
halleck
with
my
poor
mite
added
if
indeed
he
and
you
shall
think
it
entitled
to
any
consideration
at
all
the
man
whose
habitual
attitude
was
this
and
who
yet
could
upon
the
instant
take
his
own
decision
may
be
presumed
to
have
been
wise
in
many
cases
where
we
do
not
know
his
reasons
few
statesmen
perhaps
have
so
often
stood
waiting
and
refrained
themselves
from
a
firm
will
and
not
from
the
want
of
it
and
for
the
sake
of
the
rare
moment
of
action
the
passing
of
the
crisis
in
the
war
was
fittingly
commemorated
by
a
number
of
state
governors
who
combined
to
institute
a
national
cemetery
upon
the
field
of
gettysburg
it
was
dedicated
on
november
the
speech
of
the
occasion
was
delivered
by
edward
everett
the
accomplished
man
once
already
mentioned
as
the
orator
of
highest
repute
in
his
day
the
president
was
bidden
then
to
say
a
few
words
at
the
close
the
oration
with
which
for
two
hours
everett
delighted
his
vast
audience
charms
no
longer
though
it
is
full
of
graceful
sentiment
and
contains
a
very
reasonable
survey
of
the
rights
and
wrongs
involved
in
the
war
and
of
its
progress
till
then
the
few
words
of
abraham
lincoln
were
such
as
perhaps
sank
deep
but
left
his
audience
unaware
that
a
classic
had
been
spoken
which
would
endure
with
the
english
language
the
most
literary
man
present
was
also
lincoln
greatest
admirer
young
john
hay
to
him
it
seemed
that
everett
spoke
perfectly
and
the
old
man
gracefully
for
him
these
were
the
few
words
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battlefield
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
to
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
that
from
these
honoured
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
and
the
politics
of
the
events
of
our
day
may
tempt
us
to
underestimate
the
magnitude
of
the
american
civil
war
not
only
in
respect
of
its
issues
but
in
respect
of
the
efforts
that
were
put
forth
impartial
historians
declare
that
no
previous
war
had
ever
in
the
same
time
entailed
upon
the
combatants
such
enormous
sacrifices
of
life
and
wealth
even
such
battles
as
malplaquet
had
not
rivalled
in
carnage
the
battles
of
this
war
and
in
the
space
of
these
four
years
there
took
place
a
number
of
engagements
far
more
than
can
be
recounted
here
in
many
of
which
as
at
gettysburg
the
casualties
amounted
to
a
quarter
of
the
whole
forces
engaged
the
southern
armies
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
war
were
continually
being
pitted
against
vastly
superior
numbers
the
northern
armies
whether
we
look
at
the
whole
war
as
one
vast
enterprise
of
conquest
or
at
almost
any
important
battle
save
that
of
gettysburg
were
as
continually
confronted
with
great
obstacles
in
the
matter
of
locality
and
position
in
this
case
of
a
new
and
not
much
organised
country
unprepared
for
war
exact
or
intelligible
figures
as
to
losses
or
as
to
the
forces
raised
must
not
be
expected
but
according
to
what
seems
to
be
a
fair
estimate
the
total
deaths
on
the
northern
and
the
southern
side
directly
due
to
the
war
stood
to
the
population
of
the
whole
country
at
its
beginning
as
at
least
to
of
these
deaths
about
half
occurred
on
the
northern
and
half
on
the
southern
side
this
however
implies
that
in
proportion
to
its
population
the
south
lost
twice
as
heavily
as
the
north
neither
side
obtained
the
levies
of
men
that
it
needed
without
resort
to
compulsion
the
south
in
which
this
necessity
either
arose
more
quickly
or
was
seen
more
readily
had
called
up
before
the
end
of
the
war
its
whole
available
manhood
in
the
north
the
proportion
of
effort
and
sacrifice
required
was
obviously
less
and
at
least
at
one
critical
moment
it
was
disastrously
a
system
of
compulsion
to
be
used
in
default
of
volunteering
was
brought
into
effect
through
the
war
under
this
system
there
were
in
arms
at
the
end
of
the
war
white
northern
soldiers
who
probably
stood
to
the
population
at
that
time
in
as
high
a
proportion
as
to
and
everything
was
in
readiness
for
calling
up
a
vastly
greater
number
if
necessary
after
twenty
months
of
war
when
the
purely
voluntary
system
still
existed
but
was
proving
itself
inadequate
to
make
good
the
wastage
of
the
armies
the
number
in
arms
for
the
north
was
perhaps
as
much
as
in
of
the
population
then
it
would
be
useless
to
evade
the
question
which
at
once
suggests
itself
whether
the
results
of
voluntary
enlistment
in
this
country
during
the
present
war
have
surpassed
to
the
extent
to
which
they
undoubtedly
ought
to
have
surpassed
the
standard
set
by
the
north
in
the
civil
war
for
these
two
cases
furnish
the
only
instances
in
which
the
institution
of
voluntary
enlistment
has
been
submitted
to
a
severe
test
by
governments
reluctant
to
abandon
it
the
two
cases
are
of
course
not
strictly
comparable
our
own
country
in
this
matter
had
the
advantages
of
riper
organisation
political
and
social
and
of
the
preparatory
education
given
it
by
the
territorials
and
by
lord
roberts
the
extremity
of
the
need
was
in
our
case
immediately
apparent
and
the
cause
at
issue
appealed
with
the
utmost
simplicity
and
intensity
to
every
brave
and
to
every
gentle
nature
in
the
northern
states
on
the
other
hand
apart
from
all
other
considerations
there
were
certain
to
be
sections
local
racial
and
political
upon
which
the
national
cause
could
take
no
very
firm
hold
that
this
was
so
proves
no
unusual
prevalence
of
selfishness
or
of
stupidity
and
the
apathy
of
such
sections
of
the
people
like
that
of
smaller
sections
in
our
own
case
sets
in
a
brighter
light
the
devotion
which
made
so
many
eager
to
give
their
all
moreover
the
general
patriotism
of
the
northern
people
is
not
to
be
judged
by
the
failure
of
the
purely
voluntary
system
but
rather
as
will
be
seen
later
by
the
success
of
the
system
which
succeeded
it
there
is
in
our
case
no
official
statement
of
the
exact
number
serving
on
any
particular
day
but
the
facts
which
are
published
make
it
safe
to
conclude
that
at
the
end
of
fifteen
months
of
war
when
no
compulsion
was
in
force
the
soldiers
then
in
service
and
drawn
from
the
united
kingdom
alone
amounted
to
in
of
the
population
the
population
in
this
case
is
one
of
which
a
smaller
proportion
are
of
military
age
than
was
the
case
in
the
northern
states
with
their
great
number
of
immigrants
the
apparent
effect
of
these
figures
would
be
a
good
deal
heightened
if
it
were
possible
to
make
a
correct
addition
in
the
case
of
each
country
for
the
numbers
killed
or
disabled
in
war
up
to
the
dates
in
question
and
for
the
numbers
serving
afloat
moreover
the
north
when
it
was
driven
to
abandon
the
purely
voluntary
system
had
not
reached
the
point
at
which
the
withdrawal
of
men
from
civil
occupations
could
have
been
regarded
among
the
people
as
itself
a
national
danger
or
at
which
the
government
was
compelled
to
deter
some
classes
from
enlisting
new
industries
unconnected
with
the
war
were
all
the
while
springing
up
and
the
production
and
export
of
foodstuffs
were
increasing
rapidly
for
the
reasons
which
have
been
stated
there
is
nothing
invidious
in
thus
answering
an
unavoidable
question
judged
by
any
previous
standard
of
voluntary
national
effort
the
north
answered
the
test
well
each
of
our
related
peoples
must
look
upon
the
rally
of
its
fathers
and
grandfathers
in
the
one
case
its
brothers
and
sons
in
the
other
with
mingled
feelings
in
which
pride
predominates
the
most
legitimate
source
of
pride
in
our
case
being
the
unity
of
the
empire
to
each
the
question
must
present
itself
whether
the
nations
democratic
and
otherwise
which
have
followed
from
the
first
or
like
the
south
have
rapidly
adopted
a
different
principle
have
not
in
this
respect
a
juster
cause
of
pride
in
some
of
these
countries
by
common
and
almost
unquestioning
consent
generation
after
generation
of
youths
and
men
in
their
prime
have
held
themselves
at
the
instant
disposal
of
their
country
if
need
should
arise
and
in
the
absence
of
need
and
the
absence
of
excitement
have
contentedly
borne
the
appreciable
sacrifice
of
training
with
this
it
is
surely
necessary
to
join
a
further
question
whether
the
compulsion
which
under
conscription
the
public
imposes
on
individuals
is
comparable
in
its
harshness
to
the
sacrifice
and
the
conflict
of
duties
imposed
by
the
voluntary
system
upon
the
best
people
in
all
classes
as
such
from
the
manner
in
which
the
war
arose
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
the
south
was
quicker
than
the
north
in
shaping
its
policy
for
raising
armies
before
a
shot
had
been
fired
at
fort
sumter
and
when
only
seven
of
the
ten
southern
states
had
yet
seceded
president
jefferson
davis
had
at
his
command
more
than
double
the
number
of
the
united
states
army
as
it
then
was
he
had
already
lawful
authority
to
raise
that
number
to
nearly
three
times
as
many
and
though
there
was
protest
in
some
states
and
some
friction
between
the
confederate
war
department
and
the
state
militias
on
the
whole
the
seceding
states
in
theory
jealous
of
their
rights
submitted
very
readily
in
questions
of
defence
to
the
confederacy
it
is
not
clear
how
far
the
southern
people
displayed
their
warlike
temper
by
a
sustained
flow
of
voluntary
enlistment
but
their
congress
showed
the
utmost
promptitude
in
granting
every
necessary
power
to
their
president
and
on
april
a
sweeping
measure
of
compulsory
service
was
passed
the
president
of
the
confederacy
could
call
into
the
service
any
white
resident
in
the
south
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
with
certain
statutory
exemptions
there
was
of
course
trouble
about
the
difficult
question
of
exemptions
and
under
conflicting
pressure
the
confederate
congress
made
and
unmade
various
laws
about
them
after
a
time
all
statutory
exemptions
were
done
away
and
it
was
left
entirely
in
the
discretion
of
the
southern
president
to
say
what
men
were
required
in
various
departments
of
civil
life
the
liability
to
serve
was
extended
in
september
to
all
between
eighteen
and
and
finally
in
february
to
all
between
seventeen
and
fifty
the
rigorous
conscription
which
necessity
required
could
not
be
worked
without
much
complaint
there
was
a
party
disposed
to
regard
the
law
as
unconstitutional
the
existence
of
sovereign
states
within
the
confederacy
was
very
likely
an
obstacle
to
the
local
and
largely
voluntary
organisation
for
deciding
claims
which
can
exist
in
a
unified
country
a
government
so
hard
driven
must
even
if
liberally
minded
have
enforced
the
law
with
much
actual
hardship
a
belief
in
the
ruthlessness
of
the
southern
conscription
penetrated
to
the
north
if
was
probably
exaggerated
from
the
temptation
to
suppose
that
secession
was
the
work
of
a
tyranny
and
not
of
the
southern
people
desertion
and
failure
of
the
conscription
law
became
common
in
the
course
of
but
this
would
seem
to
have
been
due
not
so
much
to
resentment
at
the
system
as
to
the
actual
loss
of
a
large
part
of
the
south
and
the
spread
of
a
perception
that
the
war
was
now
hopelessly
lost
in
the
last
extremities
of
the
confederate
government
the
power
of
compulsion
of
course
completely
broke
down
but
upon
the
surface
at
least
it
seems
plain
that
what
has
been
called
the
military
despotism
of
jefferson
davis
rested
upon
the
determination
rather
than
upon
the
submissiveness
of
the
people
in
the
north
where
there
was
double
the
population
to
draw
upon
the
need
for
compulsion
was
not
likely
to
be
felt
as
soon
the
various
influences
which
would
later
depress
enlistment
had
hardly
begun
to
assert
themselves
when
the
government
as
if
to
aggravate
them
in
advance
committed
a
blunder
which
has
never
been
surpassed
in
its
own
line
on
april
recruiting
was
stopped
dead
the
central
recruiting
office
at
washington
was
closed
and
its
staff
dispersed
many
writers
agree
in
charging
this
error
against
stanton
he
must
have
been
the
prime
author
of
it
but
this
does
not
exonerate
lincoln
it
was
no
departmental
matter
but
a
matter
of
supreme
policy
lincoln
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
his
appreciation
of
the
larger
bearings
of
every
question
might
have
been
expected
to
set
stanton
right
unless
indeed
the
thing
was
done
suddenly
behind
his
back
in
any
case
this
must
be
added
to
the
indications
seen
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
lincoln
calm
strength
and
sure
judgment
had
at
that
time
not
yet
reached
their
full
development
as
for
stanton
a
man
of
much
narrower
mind
but
acute
devoted
and
morally
fearless
kept
in
the
war
department
as
a
sort
of
tame
tiger
to
prey
on
abuses
negligences
pretensions
and
political
influences
this
was
one
among
a
hundred
smaller
erratic
doings
which
his
critics
have
never
thought
of
as
outweighing
his
peculiar
usefulness
his
departmental
point
of
view
can
easily
be
understood
recruits
embarrassingly
presented
themselves
much
faster
than
they
could
be
organised
or
equipped
and
an
overdriven
office
did
not
pause
to
think
out
some
scheme
of
enlistment
for
deferred
service
waste
had
been
terrific
and
stanton
did
not
dislike
a
petty
economy
which
might
shock
people
in
washington
mcclellan
clamoured
for
more
men
let
him
do
something
with
what
he
had
got
stanton
indeed
very
readily
became
sanguine
that
mcclellan
once
in
motion
would
crush
the
confederacy
events
conspired
to
make
the
mistake
disastrous
in
these
very
days
the
confederacy
was
about
to
pass
its
own
conscription
act
mcclellan
instead
of
pressing
on
to
richmond
sat
down
before
yorktown
and
let
the
confederate
conscripts
come
up
halleck
was
crawling
southward
when
a
rapid
advance
might
have
robbed
the
south
of
a
large
recruiting
area
the
reopening
of
enlistment
came
on
the
top
of
the
huge
disappointment
at
mcclellan
failure
in
the
peninsula
there
was
a
creditable
response
to
the
call
which
was
then
made
for
volunteers
but
the
disappointment
of
the
war
continued
throughout
the
second
bull
run
the
inconclusive
sequel
to
antietam
fredericksburg
and
side
by
side
with
these
events
the
failure
of
buell
and
rosecrans
operations
the
spirit
of
voluntary
service
seems
to
have
revived
vigorously
enough
wherever
and
whenever
the
danger
of
southern
invasion
became
pressing
but
under
this
protracted
depressing
influence
it
no
longer
rose
to
the
task
of
subduing
the
south
it
must
be
added
that
wages
in
civil
employment
were
very
high
lincoln
it
is
evident
felt
this
apparent
failure
of
patriotism
sadly
but
in
calm
retrospect
it
can
not
seem
surprising
in
the
latter
part
of
attempts
were
made
to
use
the
powers
of
compulsion
which
the
several
states
possessed
under
the
antiquated
laws
as
to
militia
which
existed
in
all
of
them
in
order
to
supplement
recruiting
the
number
of
men
raised
for
short
periods
in
this
way
is
so
small
that
the
description
of
the
northern
armies
at
this
time
as
purely
volunteer
armies
hardly
needs
qualification
it
would
probably
be
worth
no
one
while
to
investigate
the
makeshift
system
with
which
the
government
very
properly
then
tried
to
help
itself
out
for
it
speedily
and
completely
failed
the
conscription
act
which
became
law
on
march
set
up
for
the
first
time
an
organisation
for
recruiting
which
covered
the
whole
country
but
was
under
the
complete
control
of
the
federal
government
it
was
placed
under
an
officer
of
great
ability
general
j
fry
formerly
chief
of
staff
to
buell
and
now
entitled
it
was
his
business
through
in
a
number
of
districts
each
divisible
into
as
convenience
might
require
to
enroll
all
male
citizens
between
twenty
and
he
was
to
assign
a
quota
in
other
words
a
stated
proportion
of
the
number
of
troops
for
which
the
government
might
at
any
time
call
to
each
district
having
regard
to
the
number
of
previous
enlistments
from
each
district
the
management
of
voluntary
enlistment
was
placed
in
his
hands
in
order
that
the
two
methods
of
recruiting
might
be
worked
in
harmony
the
system
as
a
whole
was
quite
distinct
from
any
such
system
of
universal
service
as
might
have
been
set
up
beforehand
in
time
of
peace
compulsion
only
came
into
force
in
default
of
sufficient
volunteers
from
any
district
to
provide
its
required
number
of
the
troops
wanted
when
it
came
into
force
the
drafts
of
conscripts
were
chosen
by
lot
from
among
those
enrolled
as
liable
for
service
but
there
was
a
way
of
escape
from
actual
service
it
seems
from
what
lincoln
wrote
to
have
been
looked
upon
as
a
principle
established
by
precedent
in
all
countries
that
the
man
on
whom
the
lot
fell
might
provide
a
substitute
if
he
could
the
market
price
of
a
substitute
a
commodity
for
the
provision
of
which
a
class
of
substitute
brokers
came
into
being
proved
to
be
about
dollars
business
or
professional
men
who
felt
they
could
not
be
spared
from
home
but
wished
to
act
patriotically
did
buy
substitutes
but
they
need
not
have
done
so
for
the
law
contained
a
provision
intended
as
lincoln
recorded
to
safeguard
poorer
men
against
such
a
rise
in
prices
they
could
escape
by
paying
dollars
or
pounds
not
in
the
then
state
of
wages
an
extravagant
penalty
upon
an
man
the
sums
paid
under
this
provision
covered
the
cost
of
the
recruiting
business
most
emphatically
the
conscription
law
operated
mainly
as
a
stimulus
to
voluntary
enlistment
the
volunteer
received
as
the
conscript
did
not
a
bounty
from
the
government
states
counties
and
smaller
localities
when
once
a
quota
was
assigned
to
them
vied
with
one
another
in
filling
their
quota
with
volunteers
and
for
that
purpose
added
to
the
government
bounty
it
goes
without
saying
that
in
a
new
country
with
its
scattered
country
population
and
its
disorganised
great
new
towns
there
were
plenty
of
abuses
substitute
brokers
provided
the
wrong
article
ingenious
rascals
invented
the
trade
of
and
would
enlist
for
a
bounty
desert
enlist
for
another
bounty
and
so
on
indefinitely
and
the
number
of
men
enrolled
who
were
afterwards
unaccounted
for
was
large
there
was
of
course
also
grumbling
of
localities
at
the
quotas
assigned
to
them
though
no
pains
were
spared
to
assign
them
fairly
there
was
some
opposition
to
the
working
of
the
law
after
it
was
passed
but
it
was
not
general
but
partly
the
opposition
of
rowdies
in
degraded
neighbourhoods
partly
factitious
political
opposition
and
partly
seditious
and
openly
friendly
to
the
south
in
general
the
country
accepted
the
law
as
a
manifest
military
necessity
the
spirit
and
manner
of
its
acceptance
may
be
judged
from
the
results
of
any
of
the
calls
for
troops
under
this
law
for
example
in
december
towards
the
end
of
the
war
men
were
brought
up
to
the
colours
of
these
it
seems
that
were
ordinary
volunteers
were
substitutes
provided
by
conscripts
and
only
were
actually
compelled
men
it
is
perhaps
more
significant
still
that
among
those
who
did
not
serve
there
were
only
who
paid
the
penalty
as
against
the
who
must
have
paid
at
least
three
times
that
sum
for
substitutes
behind
the
men
who
had
been
called
up
by
the
end
of
the
war
the
north
had
enrolled
and
ready
to
be
called
over
two
million
men
the
north
had
not
to
suffer
as
the
south
suffered
but
unquestionably
in
this
matter
it
rose
to
the
occasion
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
law
was
much
questioned
by
politicians
but
never
finally
tried
out
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
there
seems
to
be
no
room
for
doubt
that
lincoln
own
reasoning
on
this
matter
was
sound
the
constitution
simply
gave
to
congress
power
to
raise
and
support
armies
without
a
word
as
to
the
particular
means
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
the
new
and
extremely
constitution
of
the
confederacy
was
in
this
respect
the
same
the
constitution
argued
lincoln
would
not
have
given
the
power
of
raising
armies
without
one
word
as
to
the
mode
in
which
it
was
to
be
exercised
if
it
had
not
meant
congress
to
be
the
sole
judge
as
to
the
mode
the
principle
he
wrote
of
the
draft
which
simply
is
involuntary
or
enforced
service
is
not
new
it
has
been
practised
in
all
ages
of
the
world
it
was
well
known
to
the
framers
of
our
constitution
as
one
of
the
modes
of
raising
armies
it
had
been
used
just
before
in
establishing
our
independence
and
it
was
also
used
under
the
constitution
in
in
fact
as
we
have
seen
a
certain
power
of
compelling
military
service
existed
in
each
of
the
states
and
had
existed
in
them
from
the
first
their
ancestors
had
brought
the
principle
with
them
from
the
old
country
in
which
the
system
of
the
militia
ballot
had
not
fallen
into
desuetude
when
they
became
independent
the
traditional
english
jealousy
which
the
american
colonies
had
imbibed
against
the
military
power
of
the
crown
had
never
manifested
itself
in
any
objection
to
the
means
which
might
be
taken
to
raise
soldiers
but
in
establishing
a
strict
control
of
the
number
which
the
crown
could
at
any
moment
maintain
and
this
control
had
long
been
in
england
and
had
always
been
in
america
completely
effective
we
may
therefore
treat
the
protest
which
was
raised
against
the
law
as
unconstitutional
and
the
companion
argument
that
it
tended
towards
military
despotism
as
having
belonged
to
the
realm
of
political
verbiage
and
as
neither
founded
in
reason
nor
addressed
to
living
popular
emotions
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
northern
people
of
whom
a
large
part
were
it
must
be
remembered
democrats
seem
to
have
regarded
these
contentions
and
a
real
sense
apart
from
these
contentions
that
conscription
was
unnecessary
or
produced
avoidable
hardship
seems
scarcely
to
have
existed
it
was
probably
for
this
reason
that
lincoln
never
published
the
address
to
the
people
or
perhaps
more
particularly
to
the
democratic
opposition
to
which
several
references
have
already
been
made
in
the
course
of
it
he
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
ever
since
a
variety
of
motives
pressing
some
in
one
direction
and
some
in
the
other
would
be
presented
to
the
mind
of
each
man
physically
fit
to
be
a
soldier
upon
the
combined
effect
of
which
motives
he
would
or
would
not
voluntarily
enter
the
service
among
these
motives
would
be
patriotism
political
bias
ambition
personal
courage
love
of
adventure
want
of
employment
and
convenience
or
the
opposite
of
some
of
these
we
already
have
and
have
had
in
the
service
as
it
appears
substantially
all
that
can
be
obtained
upon
this
voluntary
weighing
of
motives
and
yet
we
must
somehow
obtain
more
or
relinquish
the
original
object
of
the
contest
together
with
all
the
blood
and
treasure
already
expended
in
the
effort
to
secure
it
to
meet
this
necessity
the
law
for
the
draft
has
been
enacted
you
who
do
not
wish
to
be
soldiers
do
not
like
this
law
this
is
natural
nor
does
it
imply
want
of
patriotism
nothing
can
be
so
just
and
necessary
as
to
make
us
like
it
if
it
is
disagreeable
to
us
we
are
prone
too
to
find
false
arguments
with
which
to
excuse
ourselves
for
opposing
such
disagreeable
things
he
proceeded
to
meet
some
of
these
arguments
upon
the
lines
which
have
already
been
indicated
after
speaking
of
the
precedents
for
conscription
in
america
he
continued
wherein
is
the
peculiar
hardship
now
shall
we
shrink
from
the
necessary
means
to
maintain
our
free
government
which
our
grandfathers
employed
to
establish
it
and
our

the

of

out
unfair
administration
was
apprehended
this
law
he
said
belongs
to
a
class
which
class
is
composed
of
those
laws
whose
object
is
to
distribute
burthens
or
benefits
on
the
principle
of
equality
no
one
of
these
laws
can
ever
be
practically
administered
with
that
exactness
which
can
be
conceived
of
in
the
mind
a
tax
law
will
be
a
dead
letter
if
no
one
will
be
compelled
to
pay
until
it
can
be
shown
that
every
other
one
will
be

to

in
precisely
the

proportion

nay
even
it

a
dead
letter
if
no

to

it
is
certain
that
every

will
pay
at
all
this
sort
of
difficulty
applies
in
full
force
to
the
practical
administration
of
the
draft
law
in
fact
the
difficulty
is
greater
in
the
case
of
the
draft
law
and
he
proceeded
to
state
the
difficulties
in
all
these
points
he
continued
errors
will
occur
in
spite
of
the
utmost
fidelity
the
government
is
bound
to
administer
the
law
with
such
an
approach
to
exactness
as
is
usual
in
analogous
cases
and
as
entire
good
faith
and
fidelity
will
reach
errors
capable
of
correction
should
he
promised
be
corrected
when
pointed
out
but
he
concluded
with
these
views
and
on
these
principles
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
it
is
my
purpose
to
see
the
draft
law
faithfully
executed
it
was
his
way
as
has
been
seen
sometimes
to
set
his
thoughts
very
plainly
on
paper
and
to
consider
afterwards
the
wisdom
of
publishing
them
this
paper
never
saw
the
light
till
after
his
death
it
is
said
that
some
scruple
as
to
the
custom
in
his
office
restrained
him
from
sending
it
out
but
this
scruple
probably
weighed
with
him
the
more
because
he
saw
that
the
sincere
people
whom
he
had
thought
of
addressing
needed
no
such
appeal
it
was
surely
a
wise
man
who
writing
so
wisely
could
see
the
greater
wisdom
of
silence
the
opposition
to
the
conscription
law
may
be
treated
simply
as
one
element
in
the
propaganda
of
the
official
opposition
to
the
administration
the
opposition
to
such
a
measure
which
we
might
possibly
have
expected
to
arise
from
churches
or
from
schools
of
thought
independent
of
the
ordinary
parties
does
not
seem
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
have
arisen
the
democratic
party
had
as
we
have
seen
revived
in
force
in
the
latter
part
of
persons
ambitious
from
whatever
mixture
of
motives
of
figuring
as
leaders
of
opposition
during
a
war
which
they
did
not
condemn
found
a
public
to
which
to
appeal
mainly
because
the
war
was
not
going
well
they
found
a
principle
of
opposition
satisfactory
to
themselves
in
condemning
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
it
was
significant
that
mcclellan
shortly
after
the
proclamation
issued
a
general
order
enjoining
obedience
to
the
government
and
adding
the
hint
that
the
remedy
for
political
errors
if
any
are
committed
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
action
of
the
people
at
the
polls
in
the
curious
creed
which
respectable
men
with
whom
allegiance
to
an
ancient
party
could
be
a
powerful
motive
at
such
a
time
were
driven
to
construct
for
themselves
enforcement
of
the
duty
to
defend
the
country
and
liberation
of
the
enemy
slaves
appeared
as
twin
offences
against
the
sacred
principles
of
constitutional
freedom
it
would
have
been
monstrous
to
say
that
most
of
the
democrats
were
opposed
to
the
war
though
a
considerable
number
had
always
disliked
it
and
now
found
courage
to
speak
loudly
the
bulk
were
as
loyal
to
the
union
as
those
very
strong
republicans
like
greeley
who
later
on
despaired
of
maintaining
it
but
there
were
naturally
democrats
for
whom
a
chance
now
appeared
in
politics
and
who
possessed
that
common
type
of
political
mind
that
meditates
deeply
on
minor
issues
and
is
inflamed
by
zeal
against
minor
evils
such
men
began
to
debate
with
their
consciences
whether
the
wicked
government
might
not
become
more
odious
than
the
enemy
there
arose
too
as
there
often
arises
in
war
time
a
fraternal
feeling
between
men
who
hated
the
war
and
men
who
reflected
how
much
better
they
could
have
if
waged
it
themselves
there
was
of
course
much
in
the
conduct
of
the
government
which
called
for
criticism
and
on
that
account
it
was
a
grievous
pity
that
independence
should
have
stultified
itself
by
reviving
in
any
form
the
root
principle
of
party
government
and
recognising
as
the
best
critics
of
the
administration
men
who
desired
to
take
its
place
more
useful
censure
of
the
government
at
that
time
might
have
come
from
men
who
if
they
had
axes
to
grind
would
have
publicly
thrown
them
away
there
were
two
points
which
especially
called
for
criticism
apart
from
military
administration
upon
which
as
it
happened
lincoln
knew
more
than
his
critics
knew
and
more
than
he
could
say
one
of
these
points
was
extravagance
and
corruption
in
the
matter
of
army
contracts
and
the
like
these
evils
were
dangerously
prevalent
but
members
of
the
cabinet
were
as
anxious
to
prevent
them
as
any
outside
critic
could
be
and
it
was
friendly
help
not
censure
that
was
required
the
other
point
was
the
exercise
of
martial
law
a
difficult
question
upon
which
a
word
must
here
be
said
but
upon
which
only
those
could
usefully
have
spoken
out
whose
general
support
of
the
government
was
pronounced
and
sincere
in
almost
every
rebellion
or
civil
war
statesmen
and
the
military
officers
under
them
are
confronted
with
the
need
for
the
sake
of
the
public
safety
or
even
of
ordinary
justice
of
rules
and
procedure
which
the
law
in
peace
time
would
abhor
in
great
conflicts
such
as
our
own
wars
after
the
french
revolution
and
the
american
civil
war
statesmen
such
as
pitt
and
lincoln
capable
of
handling
such
a
problem
well
have
had
their
hands
full
of
yet
more
urgent
matters
the
puzzling
part
of
the
problem
does
not
lie
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
actual
fighting
where
for
the
moment
there
can
be
no
law
but
the
will
of
the
commander
but
in
the
districts
more
distantly
affected
or
in
the
period
when
the
war
is
smouldering
out
lincoln
government
had
at
first
to
guard
itself
against
dangerous
plots
which
could
be
scented
but
not
proved
in
washington
later
on
it
had
to
answer
such
questions
as
this
what
should
be
done
when
a
suspected
agent
of
the
enemy
is
vaguely
seen
to
be
working
against
enlistment
when
an
attack
by
the
civil
mob
upon
the
recruits
is
likely
to
result
and
when
the
local
magistrate
and
police
are
not
much
to
be
trusted
there
is
no
doubt
that
seward
at
the
beginning
and
stanton
persistently
and
zealous
local
commanders
now
and
then
solved
such
problems
in
a
very
hasty
fashion
or
that
lincoln
throughout
was
far
more
anxious
to
stand
by
vigorous
agents
of
the
government
than
to
correct
them
lincoln
claimed
that
as
he
had
during
the
continuance
of
civil
war
a
lawful
authority
over
the
lives
and
liberties
of
all
citizens
whether
loyal
or
otherwise
such
as
any
military
commander
exercises
in
hostile
country
occupied
by
his
troops
he
held
that
there
was
no
proper
legal
remedy
for
persons
injured
under
this
authority
except
by
impeachment
of
himself
he
held
further
that
this
authority
extended
to
every
place
to
which
the
action
of
the
enemy
in
any
form
extended
that
is
to
the
whole
country
this
he
took
to
be
the
doctrine
of
english
common
law
and
he
contended
that
the
constitution
left
this
doctrine
in
full
force
whatever
may
be
said
as
to
his
view
of
the
common
law
doctrine
his
construction
of
the
constitution
would
now
be
held
by
every
one
to
have
been
wrong
plainly
read
the
constitution
swept
away
the
whole
of
that
somewhat
undefined
doctrine
of
martial
law
which
may
be
found
in
some
decisions
of
our
courts
and
it
did
much
more
every
legislature
in
the
british
empire
can
subject
to
the
veto
of
the
crown
enact
whatever
exceptional
measures
of
public
safety
it
thinks
necessary
in
an
emergency
the
constitution
restricted
this
legislative
power
within
the
very
narrowest
limits
there
is
moreover
a
recognised
british
practice
initiated
by
wellington
and
castlereagh
by
which
all
question
as
to
the
authority
of
martial
law
is
avoided
a
governor
or
commander
during
great
public
peril
is
encouraged
to
consider
what
is
right
and
necessary
not
what
is
lawful
knowing
that
if
necessary
there
will
be
enquiry
into
his
conduct
afterwards
but
knowing
also
that
unless
he
acts
quite
unconscionably
he
and
his
agents
will
be
protected
by
an
act
of
indemnity
from
the
legal
consequences
of
whatever
they
have
done
in
good
faith
the
american
constitution
would
seem
to
render
any
such
act
of
indemnity
impossible
in
a
strictly
legal
sense
therefore
the
power
which
lincoln
exercised
must
be
said
to
have
been
usurped
the
arguments
by
which
he
defended
his
own
legality
read
now
as
good
arguments
on
what
the
law
should
have
been
but
bad
arguments
on
what
the
law
was
he
did
not
perhaps
attach
extreme
importance
to
this
legal
contention
for
he
declared
plainly
that
he
was
ready
to
break
the
law
in
minor
matters
rather
than
let
the
whole
fabric
of
law
go
to
ruin
this
however
does
not
prove
that
he
was
insincere
when
he
pleaded
legal
as
well
as
moral
justification
he
probably
regarded
the
constitution
in
a
manner
which
modern
lawyers
find
it
difficult
to
realise
he
probably
applied
in
construing
it
a
principle
such
as
hamilton
laid
down
for
the
construction
of
statutes
that
it
was
qualified
and
controlled
by
the
common
law
and
by
considerations
of
convenience
and
of
reason
and
of
the
policy
which
its
framers
as
wise
and
honest
men
would
have
followed
in
present
circumstances
he
probably
would
have
adapted
to
the
occasion
hamilton
position
that
construction
may
be
made
against
the
letter
of
the
statute
to
render
it
agreeable
to
natural
justice
in
the
exercise
of
his
supposed
prerogative
lincoln
sanctioned
from
beginning
to
end
of
the
war
the
arrest
of
many
suspected
dangerous
persons
under
what
may
be
called
letters
de
cachet
from
seward
and
afterwards
from
stanton
he
publicly
professed
in
his
regret
that
he
had
not
caused
this
to
be
done
in
cases
such
as
those
of
lee
and
joseph
johnston
where
it
had
not
been
done
when
agitation
arose
on
the
matter
in
the
end
of
many
political
prisoners
were
no
doubt
wisely
released
congress
then
proceeded
in
to
exercise
such
powers
in
the
matter
as
the
constitution
gave
it
by
an
act
suspending
where
the
president
thought
fit
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
delivered
curiously
enough
by
old
friend
david
davis
showed
that
the
real
effect
of
this
act
so
far
as
valid
under
the
constitution
was
ridiculously
small
see
parte
russell
in
any
case
the
act
was
hedged
about
with
many
precautions
these
were
entirely
disregarded
by
the
government
which
proceeded
avowedly
upon
lincoln
theory
of
martial
law
the
whole
country
was
eventually
proclaimed
to
be
under
martial
law
and
many
persons
were
at
the
orders
of
the
local
military
commander
tried
and
punished
by
for
offences
such
as
the
discouragement
of
enlistment
or
the
encouragement
of
desertion
which
might
not
have
been
punishable
by
the
ordinary
law
or
of
which
the
ordinary
courts
might
not
have
convicted
them
this
fresh
outbreak
of
martial
law
must
in
large
part
be
ascribed
to
lincoln
determination
that
the
conscription
act
should
not
be
frustrated
but
apart
from
offences
relating
to
enlistment
there
was
from
onwards
no
lack
of
seditious
plots
fomented
by
the
agents
of
the
confederacy
in
canada
and
there
were
several
secret
societies
knights
of
this
that
or
the
other
lincoln
it
is
true
scoffed
at
these
but
very
often
the
general
on
the
spot
thought
seriously
of
them
and
the
extreme
democratic
leader
vallandigham
boasted
that
there
were
half
a
million
men
in
the
north
enrolled
in
such
seditious
organisations
drastic
as
the
government
proceedings
were
the
opposition
to
them
died
down
before
the
popular
conviction
that
strong
measures
were
necessary
and
the
popular
appreciation
that
the
despot
king
abraham
as
some
democrats
were
pleased
to
call
him
was
not
of
the
stuff
of
which
despots
were
made
and
was
among
the
least
men
living
the
civil
courts
made
no
attempt
to
interfere
they
said
that
whatever
the
law
they
could
not
in
fact
resist
generals
commanding
armies
british
courts
would
in
many
cases
have
declined
to
interfere
not
on
the
ground
that
the
general
had
the
might
but
on
the
ground
that
he
had
the
right
yet
it
seems
they
would
not
quite
have
relinquished
their
hold
on
the
matter
but
would
have
held
themselves
free
to
consider
whether
the
district
in
which
martial
law
was
exercised
was
materially
affected
by
the
state
of
war
or
not
the
legal
controversy
ended
in
a
manner
hardly
edifying
to
the
layman
in
the
course
of
the
supreme
court
solemnly
tried
out
the
question
of
the
right
of
one
milligan
to
a
writ
of
at
that
time
the
war
the
only
ground
on
which
the
right
could
have
been
refused
him
had
for
some
months
been
ended
and
nobody
in
court
knew
or
cared
whether
milligan
was
then
living
to
enjoy
his
right
or
had
been
shot
long
before
save
in
a
few
cases
of
special
public
interest
lincoln
took
no
personal
part
in
the
actual
administration
of
these
coercive
measures
so
great
a
tax
was
put
upon
his
time
and
indeed
his
strength
by
the
personal
consideration
of
cases
of
discipline
in
the
army
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
undertaken
a
further
labour
of
the
sort
moreover
he
thought
it
more
necessary
for
the
public
good
to
give
steady
support
to
his
ministers
and
generals
than
to
check
their
action
in
detail
he
contended
that
no
great
injustice
was
likely
to
arise
very
likely
he
was
wrong
not
only
democrats
but
men
like
senator
john
sherman
a
strong
and
sensible
republican
thought
him
wrong
there
are
evil
stories
about
the
secret
police
under
stanton
and
some
records
of
the
proceedings
of
the
composed
sometimes
of
the
officers
least
useful
at
the
front
are
not
creditable
very
likely
as
john
sherman
thought
the
ordinary
law
would
have
met
the
needs
of
the
case
in
many
districts
the
mere
number
of
the
political
prisoners
who
counted
by
thousands
proves
nothing
for
the
least
consideration
of
the
circumstances
will
show
that
the
active
supporters
of
the
confederacy
in
the
north
must
have
been
very
numerous
nor
does
it
matter
much
that
to
the
horror
of
some
people
there
were
persons
of
station
culture
and
respectability
among
the
sufferers
persons
of
this
kind
were
not
likely
to
be
exposed
to
charges
of
disloyal
conduct
if
they
were
actively
loyal
obscure
and
ignorant
men
are
much
more
likely
to
have
become
the
innocent
victims
of
spiteful
accusers
or
vile
agents
of
police
doubtless
this
might
happen
but
that
does
not
of
itself
condemn
lincoln
for
having
maintained
an
extreme
form
of
martial
law
the
particular
kind
of
oppression
that
is
likely
to
have
occurred
is
one
against
which
the
normal
procedure
of
justice
and
police
in
america
is
said
to
provide
no
sufficient
safeguard
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
regular
course
of
law
would
have
exposed
the
public
weal
to
formidable
dangers
but
it
by
no
means
follows
that
it
would
have
saved
individuals
from
wrong
the
risk
that
many
individuals
would
be
grievously
wronged
was
at
least
not
very
great
the
government
was
not
pursuing
men
for
erroneous
opinions
but
for
certain
very
definite
kinds
of
action
dangerous
to
the
state
these
were
indeed
kinds
of
action
with
which
lincoln
thought
ordinary
courts
of
justice
utterly
incompetent
to
deal
and
he
avowed
that
he
aimed
rather
at
preventing
intended
actions
than
at
punishing
them
when
done
to
some
minds
this
will
seem
to
be
an
attitude
dangerous
to
liberty
but
he
was
surely
justified
when
he
said
in
such
cases
the
purposes
of
men
are
much
more
easily
understood
than
in
cases
of
ordinary
crime
the
man
who
stands
by
and
says
nothing
when
the
peril
of
his
government
is
discussed
can
not
be
misunderstood
if
not
hindered
he
is
sure
to
help
the
enemy
much
more
if
he
talks
ambiguously
talks
for
his
country
with
and
and
in
any
case
lincoln
stood
clearly
and
boldly
for
repressing
speech
or
act
that
could
help
the
enemy
with
extreme
vigour
and
total
disregard
for
the
legalities
of
peace
time
a
little
later
on
we
shall
see
fully
whether
this
imported
on
his
part
any
touch
whatever
of
the
ferocity
which
it
may
seem
to
suggest
the
democratic
opposition
which
made
some
headway
in
the
first
half
of
comprised
a
more
extreme
opposition
prevailing
in
the
west
and
led
by
clement
vallandigham
a
congressman
from
ohio
and
a
milder
opposition
led
by
horatio
seymour
who
from
the
end
of
to
the
end
of
when
he
failed
of
was
governor
of
new
york
state
the
extreme
section
were
often
called
copperheads
after
a
venomous
snake
of
that
name
strictly
perhaps
this
political
term
should
be
limited
to
the
few
who
went
so
far
as
to
desire
the
victory
of
the
south
more
loosely
it
was
applied
to
a
far
larger
number
who
went
no
further
than
to
say
that
the
war
should
be
stopped
this
demand
it
must
be
observed
was
based
upon
the
change
of
policy
shown
in
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
the
war
for
the
union
said
vallandigham
in
congress
in
january
is
in
your
hands
a
most
bloody
and
costly
failure
war
for
the
union
was
abandoned
war
for
the
negro
openly
begun
with
what
success
let
the
dead
at
fredericksburg
ought
this
war
to
continue
i
answer
no
not
a
day
not
an
hour
what
then
shall
we
separate
again
i
answer
no
no
stop
fighting
make
an
armistice
accept
at
once
friendly
foreign
mediation
and
further
the
secret
but
real
purpose
of
the
war
was
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
states
and
with
it
the
change
of
our
present
democratical
form
of
government
into
an
imperial
despotism
this
was
in
no
sense
treason
it
was
merely
humbug
the
alleged
design
to
establish
despotism
chiefly
revealed
at
that
moment
by
the
liberation
of
slaves
had
of
course
no
existence
equally
false
as
will
be
seen
later
was
the
whole
suggestion
that
any
peace
could
have
been
had
with
the
south
except
on
the
terms
of
separation
vallandigham
a
demagogue
of
real
vigour
had
perhaps
so
much
honesty
as
is
compatible
with
at
any
rate
upon
his
subsequent
visit
to
the
south
his
intercourse
with
southern
leaders
was
conducted
on
the
footing
that
the
union
should
be
restored
but
his
character
inspired
no
respect
burnside
now
commanding
the
troops
in
ohio
held
that
violent
denunciation
of
the
government
in
a
tone
that
tended
to
demoralise
the
troops
was
treason
since
it
certainly
was
not
patriotism
and
when
in
may
vallandigham
made
a
very
violent
and
offensive
speech
in
ohio
he
had
him
arrested
in
his
house
at
night
and
sent
him
before
a
which
imprisoned
him
loud
protest
was
raised
by
every
democrat
this
worry
came
upon
lincoln
just
after
chancellorsville
he
regretted
action
later
on
he
had
to
reverse
the
rash
suppression
of
a
newspaper
by
which
burnside
provoked
violent
indignation
but
on
this
occasion
he
would
only
say
in
public
that
he
regretted
the
necessity
of
such
action
evidently
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
support
a
general
against
a
dangerous
agitator
the
course
which
after
some
consideration
he
took
was
of
the
nature
of
a
practical
joke
perhaps
justified
by
its
success
vallandigham
was
indeed
released
he
was
taken
to
the
front
and
handed
over
to
the
confederates
as
if
he
had
been
an
exchanged
prisoner
of
war
in
reply
to
demands
from
the
democratic
organisation
in
ohio
that
vallandigham
might
be
allowed
to
return
home
lincoln
offered
to
consent
if
their
leaders
would
sign
a
pledge
to
support
the
war
and
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
army
this
they
called
an
evasion
vallandigham
made
his
way
to
canada
and
conducted
intrigues
from
thence
in
his
absence
he
was
put
up
for
the
governorship
of
ohio
in
november
but
defeated
by
a
huge
majority
doubtless
the
larger
because
of
gettysburg
and
vicksburg
the
next
year
he
suddenly
returned
home
braving
the
chance
of
arrest
and
probably
to
his
disappointment
lincoln
let
him
be
in
reply
to
protests
against
vallandigham
arrest
which
had
been
sent
by
meetings
in
ohio
and
new
york
lincoln
had
written
clear
defences
of
his
action
from
which
the
foregoing
account
of
his
views
on
martial
law
has
been
taken
in
one
of
them
was
a
sentence
which
probably
went
further
with
the
people
of
the
north
than
any
other
must
i
shoot
a
soldier
boy
who
deserts
while
i
must
not
touch
a
hair
of
a
wily
agitator
who
induces
him
to
desert
there
may
or
may
not
be
some
fallacy
lurking
here
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
sentence
came
from
a
pleader
ingenuity
it
was
the
expression
of
a
man
really
agonised
by
his
weekly
task
of
confirming
sentences
on
deserters
from
the
army
governor
seymour
was
a
more
presentable
antagonist
than
vallandigham
he
did
not
propose
to
stop
the
war
on
the
contrary
his
case
was
that
the
war
could
only
be
effectively
carried
on
by
a
government
which
would
unite
the
people
by
maintaining
the
constitution
not
as
the
radicals
argued
by
the
flagitious
policy
of
freeing
the
slaves
it
should
be
added
that
he
was
really
concerned
at
the
corruption
which
was
becoming
rife
for
which
war
contracts
gave
some
scope
and
which
with
a
critic
obliviousness
to
the
limitations
of
a
human
force
he
thought
the
most
administration
of
its
time
could
easily
have
put
down
with
a
little
imagination
it
is
easy
to
understand
the
difficult
position
of
the
orthodox
democrats
who
two
years
before
had
voted
against
restricting
the
extension
of
slavery
and
were
now
asked
for
the
sake
of
the
union
to
support
a
government
which
was
actually
abolishing
slavery
by
martial
law
also
the
attitude
of
the
thoroughly
partisan
is
perfectly
usual
many
of
governor
utterances
were
fair
enough
and
much
of
his
conduct
was
patriotic
enough
his
main
proceedings
can
be
briefly
summarised
his
election
as
governor
in
the
end
of
was
regarded
as
an
important
event
the
appearance
of
a
new
leader
holding
an
office
of
the
greatest
influence
lincoln
assuming
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
the
full
willingness
of
seymour
to
in
prosecuting
the
war
did
the
simplest
and
best
thing
he
wrote
and
invited
seymour
after
his
inauguration
in
march
to
a
personal
conference
with
himself
as
to
the
ways
in
which
with
their
divergent
views
they
could
best
the
governor
waited
three
weeks
before
he
acknowledged
this
letter
he
then
wrote
and
promised
a
full
reply
later
he
never
sent
this
reply
he
protested
energetically
and
firmly
against
the
arrest
of
vallandigham
in
july
the
conscription
act
began
to
be
put
in
force
in
new
york
city
then
occurred
the
only
serious
trouble
that
ever
did
occur
under
the
act
and
it
was
very
serious
a
mob
of
foreign
immigrants
mainly
irish
put
a
forcible
stop
to
the
proceeding
of
the
draft
it
set
fire
to
the
houses
of
prominent
republicans
and
prevented
the
fire
brigade
from
saving
them
it
gave
chase
to
all
negroes
that
it
met
beating
some
to
death
stringing
up
others
to
trees
and
and
burning
them
as
they
hung
it
burned
down
an
orphanage
for
coloured
children
after
the
police
had
with
difficulty
saved
its
helpless
inmates
four
days
of
rioting
prevailed
throughout
the
city
before
the
arrival
of
fresh
troops
restored
order
after
an
interval
of
prudent
length
the
draft
was
successfully
carried
out
governor
seymour
arrived
in
the
city
during
the
riots
he
harangued
this
defiled
mob
in
gentle
terms
promising
them
if
they
would
be
good
to
help
them
in
securing
redress
of
the
grievance
to
which
he
attributed
their
conduct
thenceforward
to
the
end
of
his
term
of
office
he
persecuted
lincoln
with
complaints
as
to
the
unfairness
of
the
quota
imposed
on
certain
districts
under
the
conscription
act
it
is
true
that
he
also
protested
on
presumably
sincere
constitutional
grounds
against
the
act
itself
begging
lincoln
to
suspend
its
enforcement
till
its
validity
had
been
determined
by
the
courts
as
to
this
lincoln
most
properly
agreed
to
facilitate
if
he
could
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
but
declined
on
the
ground
of
urgent
military
necessity
to
delay
the
drafts
in
the
meantime
seymour
obstructive
conduct
however
was
not
confined
to
the
intelligible
ground
of
objection
to
the
act
itself
it
showed
itself
in
the
perpetual
assertion
that
the
quotas
were
unfair
no
complaint
as
to
this
had
been
raised
before
the
riots
it
seems
that
a
quite
unintended
error
may
in
fact
at
first
have
been
made
lincoln
however
immediately
reduced
the
quotas
in
question
to
the
full
extent
which
the
alleged
error
would
have
required
fresh
complaints
from
seymour
followed
and
so
on
to
the
end
ultimately
seymour
was
invited
to
come
to
washington
and
have
out
the
whole
matter
of
his
complaints
in
conference
with
stanton
like
a
prudent
man
he
again
refused
to
face
personal
conference
it
seems
that
governor
seymour
who
was
a
great
person
in
his
day
was
very
decidedly
in
the
common
acceptance
of
the
term
a
gentleman
this
has
been
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
it
should
rather
be
treated
as
an
aggravation
of
his
very
unmeritable
conduct
thus
since
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
the
north
had
again
become
possessed
of
what
is
sometimes
considered
a
necessity
of
good
government
an
organised
opposition
ready
and
anxious
to
take
the
place
of
the
existing
administration
it
can
well
be
understood
that
honourable
men
entered
into
this
combination
but
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
on
what
common
principle
they
could
hold
together
which
would
not
have
been
disastrous
in
its
working
the
more
extreme
leaders
who
were
likely
to
prove
the
driving
force
among
them
were
not
unfitly
satirised
in
a
novel
of
the
time
called
the
man
without
a
country
their
chance
of
success
in
fact
depended
upon
the
of
their
country
in
the
war
and
on
the
irritation
against
the
government
which
could
be
aroused
by
that
cause
alone
and
not
by
such
abuses
as
they
fairly
criticised
in
the
latter
part
of
the
war
was
going
well
a
great
meeting
of
union
men
was
summoned
in
august
in
illinois
lincoln
was
tempted
to
go
and
speak
to
them
but
he
contented
himself
with
a
letter
phrases
in
it
might
suggest
the
stump
orator
more
than
in
fact
his
actual
stump
speeches
usually
did
in
it
however
he
made
plain
in
the
simplest
language
the
total
fallacy
of
such
talk
of
peace
as
had
lately
become
common
the
confederacy
meant
the
confederate
army
and
the
men
who
controlled
it
as
a
fact
no
suggestion
of
peace
or
compromise
came
from
them
if
it
ever
came
the
people
should
know
it
in
equally
simple
terms
he
sought
to
justify
even
to
supporters
of
the
union
who
did
not
share
his
wish
that
all
men
could
be
free
his
policy
in
regard
to
emancipation
in
any
case
freedom
had
for
the
sake
of
the
union
been
promised
to
negroes
who
were
now
fighting
or
working
for
the
north
and
the
promise
being
made
must
be
kept
as
that
most
critical
year
of
the
war
drew
to
a
close
there
was
a
prevailing
recognition
that
the
rough
but
straight
path
along
which
the
president
groped
his
way
was
the
right
path
and
upon
the
whole
he
enjoyed
a
degree
of
general
favour
which
was
not
often
his
portion
war
in
it
is
the
general
military
opinion
that
before
the
war
entered
on
its
final
stage
jefferson
davis
should
have
concentrated
all
his
forces
for
a
larger
invasion
of
the
north
than
was
ever
in
fact
undertaken
in
the
gettysburg
campaign
he
might
have
strengthened
lee
army
by
men
if
he
could
have
withdrawn
them
from
the
forts
at
charleston
charleston
however
was
threatened
during
by
the
sea
and
land
forces
of
the
north
in
an
expedition
which
was
probably
itself
unwise
as
lincoln
himself
seems
to
have
suspected
but
which
helped
to
divert
a
confederate
army
in
the
beginning
of
davis
still
kept
this
force
at
charleston
he
persisted
also
in
keeping
a
hold
on
his
own
state
mississippi
with
a
further
small
army
while
longstreet
still
remained
in
the
corner
of
tennessee
where
a
useful
employment
of
his
force
was
contemplated
but
none
was
made
the
chief
southern
armies
with
which
we
have
to
deal
are
that
of
lee
lying
south
of
the
rapidan
and
that
of
bragg
now
superseded
by
joseph
johnston
at
dalton
south
of
chattanooga
the
confederacy
it
is
thought
was
now
in
a
position
in
which
it
might
take
long
to
reduce
it
but
the
only
military
chance
for
it
was
concentration
on
one
great
this
seems
to
have
been
the
opinion
of
lee
and
longstreet
jefferson
davis
clung
even
late
in
the
year
to
the
belief
that
disaster
must
somehow
overtake
any
invading
northern
army
which
pushed
far
possibly
he
reckoned
also
that
the
north
would
weary
of
the
repeated
checks
in
the
process
of
conquest
indeed
as
will
be
seen
later
the
north
came
near
to
doing
so
while
a
serious
invasion
of
the
north
unless
overwhelmingly
successful
might
really
have
revived
its
spirit
in
any
case
jefferson
davis
unlike
lincoln
had
no
desire
to
be
guided
by
his
best
officers
he
was
for
ever
quarrelling
with
joseph
johnston
and
often
with
beauregard
the
less
capable
bragg
though
removed
from
the
west
was
now
installed
as
his
chief
adviser
in
richmond
and
the
genius
of
lee
was
not
encouraged
to
apply
itself
to
the
larger
strategy
of
the
war
at
the
beginning
of
an
advance
from
chattanooga
southward
into
the
heart
of
the
confederate
country
was
in
contemplation
grant
and
farragut
wished
that
it
should
be
supported
by
a
joint
military
and
naval
attack
upon
mobile
in
alabama
on
the
gulf
of
mexico
other
considerations
on
the
part
of
the
government
prevented
this
in
marshal
bazaine
had
invaded
mexico
to
set
up
louis
napoleon
client
the
archduke
maximilian
as
emperor
as
the
monroe
doctrine
really
attributable
to
the
teaching
of
hamilton
and
the
action
of
john
quincy
adams
who
was
secretary
of
state
under
president
monroe
declared
such
an
extension
of
european
influence
more
especially
dynastic
influence
on
the
american
continent
was
highly
unacceptable
to
the
united
states
many
in
the
north
were
much
excited
so
much
so
that
during
a
preposterous
resolution
which
meant
if
anything
war
with
france
was
passed
on
the
motion
of
one
henry
winter
davis
it
was
of
course
the
business
of
lincoln
and
of
seward
now
moulded
to
his
views
to
avoid
this
disaster
and
yet
with
such
dignity
as
the
situation
allowed
keep
the
french
government
aware
of
the
enmity
which
they
might
one
day
incur
they
did
this
but
they
apprehended
that
the
french
with
a
footing
for
the
moment
in
mexico
had
designs
on
texas
and
thus
though
the
southern
forces
in
texas
were
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
confederacy
and
there
was
no
haste
for
subduing
them
it
was
thought
expedient
with
an
eye
on
france
to
assert
the
interest
of
the
union
in
texas
general
banks
in
louisiana
was
sent
to
texas
with
the
forces
which
would
otherwise
have
been
sent
to
mobile
his
various
endeavours
ended
in
may
with
the
serious
defeat
of
an
expedition
up
the
red
river
this
defeat
gave
great
annoyance
to
the
north
and
made
an
end
of
banks
reputation
it
might
conceivably
have
had
a
calamitous
sequel
in
the
capture
by
the
south
of
admiral
porter
river
flotilla
which
accompanied
banks
and
the
consequent
undoing
of
the
conquest
of
the
mississippi
as
it
was
it
wasted
much
force
before
grant
could
safely
launch
his
forces
southward
from
chattanooga
against
johnston
it
was
necessary
to
deal
in
some
way
with
the
confederate
force
still
at
large
in
mississippi
grant
determined
to
do
this
by
the
destruction
of
the
railway
system
by
which
alone
it
could
move
eastward
for
this
purpose
he
left
thomas
to
hold
chattanooga
while
sherman
was
sent
to
meridian
the
chief
railway
centre
in
the
southern
part
of
mississippi
in
february
sherman
arrived
there
and
though
a
subsidiary
force
sent
from
memphis
on
a
similar
but
less
important
errand
somewhat
further
north
met
with
a
severe
repulse
he
was
able
unmolested
to
do
such
damage
to
the
lines
around
meridian
as
to
secure
grant
purpose
there
was
yet
a
further
preliminary
to
the
great
final
struggle
on
march
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
which
was
necessary
for
this
object
lincoln
conferred
upon
grant
the
rank
of
never
held
by
any
one
else
since
washington
for
it
was
only
brevet
rank
that
was
conferred
on
scott
therewith
grant
took
the
command
under
the
president
of
all
the
northern
armies
grant
came
to
washington
to
receive
his
new
honour
he
had
taken
leave
of
sherman
in
an
interchange
of
letters
which
it
is
good
to
read
but
he
had
intended
to
return
to
the
west
sherman
who
might
have
desired
the
command
in
the
west
for
himself
had
unselfishly
pressed
him
to
return
he
feared
that
the
dreaded
politicians
would
in
some
way
hurt
grant
and
that
he
would
be
thwarted
by
them
become
disgusted
and
retire
they
did
hurt
him
but
not
then
nor
in
the
way
that
sherman
had
expected
grant
however
could
trust
sherman
to
carry
out
the
work
he
wanted
done
in
the
west
and
he
now
saw
that
as
lincoln
might
have
told
him
and
possibly
did
the
work
he
wanted
done
in
the
east
must
be
done
by
him
he
went
west
again
for
a
few
days
only
to
settle
his
plans
with
sherman
sherman
with
his
army
of
was
to
follow
johnston
army
of
about
wherever
it
went
till
he
destroyed
it
grant
with
his
was
to
keep
up
an
equally
unfaltering
fight
with
lee
army
also
of
there
was
of
course
nothing
original
about
this
conception
except
the
idea
fully
present
to
both
men
minds
of
the
risk
and
sacrifice
with
which
it
was
worth
while
to
carry
it
out
lincoln
and
grant
had
never
met
till
this
month
grant
at
the
first
encounter
was
evidently
somewhat
on
his
guard
he
was
prepared
to
like
lincoln
but
he
was
afraid
of
mistaken
dictation
from
him
and
determined
to
discourage
it
also
stanton
had
advised
him
that
lincoln
out
of
mere
good
nature
would
talk
unwisely
of
any
plans
discussed
with
him
this
was
probably
quite
unjust
stanton
in
order
to
keep
politicians
and
officers
in
their
places
was
accustomed
to
bite
off
the
noses
of
all
comers
lincoln
on
the
contrary
would
talk
to
all
sorts
of
people
with
a
readiness
which
was
sometimes
astonishing
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
method
in
this
he
learnt
something
from
these
people
all
the
time
and
he
certainly
had
a
very
great
power
of
keeping
his
own
counsel
when
he
chose
in
any
case
when
grant
at
the
end
of
april
left
washington
for
the
front
he
parted
with
lincoln
on
terms
of
mutual
trust
which
never
afterwards
varied
lincoln
in
fact
satisfied
as
to
his
general
purpose
had
been
happy
to
leave
him
to
make
his
plans
for
himself
he
wrote
to
grant
not
expecting
to
see
you
again
before
the
spring
campaign
begins
i
wish
to
express
in
this
way
my
entire
satisfaction
with
what
you
have
done
up
to
this
time
so
far
as
i
understand
it
the
particulars
of
your
plan
i
neither
know
nor
seek
to
know
you
are
vigilant
and
and
pleased
with
this
i
wish
not
to
obtrude
any
constraints
or
restraints
upon
you
while
i
am
very
anxious
that
any
great
disaster
or
capture
of
our
men
in
great
numbers
shall
be
avoided
i
know
these
points
are
less
likely
to
escape
your
attention
than
they
would
be
mine
if
there
is
anything
wanting
which
is
within
my
power
to
give
do
not
fail
to
let
me
know
it
and
now
with
a
brave
army
and
a
just
cause
may
god
sustain
you
grant
replied
from
my
first
entrance
into
the
volunteer
service
of
the
country
to
the
present
day
i
have
never
had
cause
of
complaint
have
never
expressed
or
implied
a
complaint
against
the
administration
or
the
secretary
of
war
for
throwing
any
embarrassment
in
the
way
of
my
vigorously
prosecuting
what
appeared
to
me
my
duty
indeed
since
the
promotion
which
placed
me
in
command
of
all
the
armies
and
in
view
of
the
great
responsibility
and
importance
of
success
i
have
been
astonished
at
the
readiness
with
which
everything
asked
for
has
been
yielded
without
even
an
explanation
being
asked
should
my
success
be
less
than
i
desire
or
expect
the
least
i
can
say
is
the
fault
is
not
with
you
at
this
point
the
real
responsibility
of
lincoln
in
regard
to
military
events
became
comparatively
small
and
to
the
end
of
the
war
those
events
may
be
traced
with
even
less
detail
than
has
hitherto
been
necessary
upon
joining
the
army
of
the
potomac
grant
retained
meade
with
whom
he
was
pleased
in
a
somewhat
anomalous
position
under
him
as
commander
of
that
army
wherever
lee
goes
he
told
him
there
you
will
go
too
his
object
of
attack
was
in
agreement
with
the
opinion
which
lincoln
had
from
an
early
date
formed
lee
army
if
lee
could
be
compelled
or
should
choose
to
shut
himself
up
in
richmond
as
did
happen
then
richmond
would
become
an
object
of
attack
but
not
otherwise
grant
however
hoped
that
he
might
force
lee
to
give
him
battle
in
the
open
in
the
open
or
behind
entrenchments
he
meant
to
fight
him
reckoning
that
if
he
lost
double
the
number
that
lee
did
his
own
loss
could
easily
be
made
up
but
lee
would
be
irreparable
his
hope
was
to
a
large
extent
disappointed
he
had
to
do
with
a
greater
general
than
himself
who
with
his
men
knew
every
inch
of
a
tangled
country
in
the
engagements
which
now
followed
grant
men
were
constantly
being
hurled
against
chosen
positions
entrenched
and
with
the
new
device
of
wire
entanglements
in
front
of
them
i
mean
he
wrote
to
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
takes
all
summer
it
took
summer
autumn
winter
and
the
early
spring
once
across
the
rapidan
he
was
in
the
tract
of
scrubby
jungle
called
the
wilderness
he
had
hoped
to
escape
out
of
this
unopposed
and
at
the
same
time
to
turn
lee
right
by
a
rapid
march
to
his
own
left
but
he
found
lee
in
his
way
on
may
and
there
was
stubborn
and
indecisive
fighting
with
a
loss
to
grant
of
and
to
lee
of
perhaps
over
from
grant
point
of
view
something
gained
then
followed
a
further
movement
to
the
left
to
lee
again
lee
was
to
be
found
in
the
way
in
a
chosen
position
of
his
own
near
spottsylvania
court
house
here
on
the
five
days
from
may
to
may
the
heavy
fighting
was
continued
with
a
total
loss
to
grant
of
over
and
probably
a
proportionate
loss
to
lee
another
move
by
grant
to
the
left
now
caused
lee
to
fall
back
to
a
position
beyond
the
north
anna
river
on
which
an
attack
was
made
but
speedily
given
up
further
movements
in
the
same
general
direction
but
without
any
such
serious
fighting
grant
still
endeavouring
to
turn
lee
right
lee
still
moving
so
as
to
cover
richmond
brought
grant
by
the
end
of
the
month
to
cold
harbour
some
ten
miles
east
by
north
of
richmond
close
upon
the
scene
of
mcclellan
misadventures
meanwhile
grant
had
caused
an
expedition
under
general
butler
to
go
by
sea
up
the
james
and
to
land
a
little
south
of
richmond
which
with
the
connected
fortress
of
petersburg
miles
to
the
south
of
it
had
only
a
weak
garrison
left
butler
was
a
man
with
remarkable
powers
of
he
had
now
a
very
good
chance
of
taking
petersburg
but
his
expedition
failed
totally
from
june
to
june
grant
was
occupied
on
the
most
disastrous
enterprise
of
his
career
a
hopeless
attack
upon
a
strong
entrenched
position
which
with
the
lesser
encounters
that
took
place
within
the
next
few
days
cost
the
north
men
against
a
loss
to
the
south
which
has
been
put
as
low
as
it
was
the
one
battle
which
grant
regretted
having
fought
he
gave
up
the
hope
of
a
fight
with
lee
on
advantageous
conditions
outside
richmond
on
june
he
suddenly
moved
his
army
across
the
james
to
the
neighbourhood
of
city
point
east
of
petersburg
lee
must
now
stand
siege
in
richmond
and
petersburg
had
he
now
marched
north
against
washington
grant
would
have
been
after
him
and
would
have
secured
for
his
vastly
larger
force
the
battle
in
the
open
which
he
had
so
far
vainly
sought
yet
another
disappointment
followed
on
july
an
attempt
was
made
to
carry
petersburg
by
assault
immediately
after
the
explosion
of
an
enormous
mine
it
failed
with
heavy
loss
through
the
fault
of
the
amiable
but
injudicious
burnside
who
now
passed
into
civil
life
and
of
the
officers
under
him
the
siege
was
to
be
a
long
affair
in
reality
for
all
the
disappointment
and
in
spite
of
grant
confessed
mistake
at
cold
harbour
his
grim
plan
was
progressing
the
force
which
the
south
could
ill
spare
was
being
worn
down
and
grant
was
in
a
position
in
which
though
he
might
have
got
there
at
less
cost
and
though
the
end
would
not
be
yet
the
end
was
sure
his
army
was
for
the
time
a
good
deal
shaken
and
the
estimation
in
which
the
west
point
officers
held
him
sank
low
his
own
determination
was
quite
unshaken
and
though
lincoln
hinted
somewhat
mildly
that
these
enormous
losses
ought
not
to
recur
his
confidence
in
grant
was
unabated
too
people
in
washington
who
had
watched
all
this
with
alternations
of
feeling
that
ended
in
dejection
had
had
another
trial
to
their
nerves
early
in
july
the
northern
general
sigel
who
commanded
in
the
lower
part
of
the
shenandoah
valley
protecting
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
had
marched
southward
in
june
in
pursuance
of
a
subsidiary
part
of
grant
scheme
but
in
a
careless
and
rather
purposeless
manner
general
early
detached
by
lee
to
deal
with
him
defeated
him
outmanoeuvred
and
defeated
general
hunter
who
was
sent
to
supersede
him
overwhelmed
with
superior
force
general
lew
wallace
who
stood
in
his
way
further
on
and
upon
july
appeared
before
washington
itself
the
threat
to
washington
had
been
meant
as
no
more
than
a
threat
but
the
garrison
was
largely
made
up
of
recruits
reinforcements
to
it
sent
back
by
grant
arrived
only
on
the
same
day
as
early
and
if
that
enterprising
general
had
not
wasted
some
previous
days
there
might
have
been
a
chance
that
he
could
get
into
washington
though
not
that
he
could
hold
it
as
it
was
he
attacked
one
of
the
washington
forts
lincoln
was
present
exhibiting
till
the
officers
there
insisted
on
his
retiring
the
indifference
to
personal
danger
which
he
showed
on
other
occasions
too
the
attack
was
soon
given
up
and
in
a
few
days
early
had
escaped
back
across
the
potomac
leaving
in
grant
mind
a
determination
that
the
shenandoah
valley
should
cease
to
be
so
useful
to
the
south
sherman
set
out
from
chattanooga
on
the
day
when
grant
crossed
the
rapidan
joseph
johnston
barred
his
way
in
one
entrenched
position
after
another
sherman
with
greater
caution
than
grant
or
perhaps
with
greater
facilities
of
ground
manoeuvred
him
out
of
each
position
in
turn
pushing
him
slowly
back
along
the
line
of
the
railway
towards
atlanta
the
great
manufacturing
centre
of
georgia
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
south
by
east
from
chattanooga
only
once
towards
the
end
of
june
at
kenesaw
mountain
some
twenty
miles
north
of
atlanta
did
he
attack
johnston
entrenchments
causing
himself
some
unnecessary
loss
and
failing
in
his
direct
attack
on
them
but
probably
thinking
it
necessary
to
show
that
he
would
attack
whenever
needed
johnston
has
left
a
name
as
a
master
of
defensive
warfare
and
doubtless
delayed
and
hampered
sherman
as
much
as
he
could
jefferson
davis
angrily
and
unwisely
sent
general
hood
to
supersede
him
this
less
prudent
officer
gave
battle
several
times
bringing
up
the
confederate
loss
before
atlanta
fell
to
against
on
the
other
side
and
being
by
great
skill
on
sherman
part
compelled
to
evacuate
atlanta
on
september
by
this
time
there
had
occurred
the
last
and
most
brilliant
exploit
of
old
admiral
farragut
who
on
august
in
a
naval
engagement
of
extraordinarily
varied
incident
had
possessed
himself
of
the
harbour
of
mobile
with
its
forts
though
the
town
remained
as
a
stronghold
in
confederate
hands
and
prevented
a
junction
with
sherman
which
would
have
quite
cut
the
confederacy
in
two
nearer
washington
too
a
memorable
campaign
was
in
process
for
three
weeks
after
early
unwelcome
visit
military
mismanagement
prevailed
near
washington
early
was
able
to
turn
on
his
pursuers
and
a
further
raid
this
time
into
pennsylvania
took
place
grant
was
too
far
off
to
exercise
control
except
through
a
sufficiently
able
subordinate
which
hunter
was
not
halleck
as
in
a
former
crisis
did
not
help
matters
lincoln
though
at
this
time
he
issued
a
large
new
call
for
recruits
was
unwilling
any
longer
to
give
military
orders
just
now
his
political
anxieties
had
reached
their
height
his
judgment
was
never
firmer
but
friends
thought
his
strength
was
breaking
under
the
strain
on
this
and
on
all
grounds
he
was
certainly
wise
to
decline
direct
interference
in
military
affairs
on
august
grant
ordered
general
philip
sheridan
to
the
shenandoah
on
temporary
duty
expressing
a
wish
that
he
should
be
put
in
command
of
all
the
troops
in
the
field
with
instructions
to
put
himself
south
of
the
enemy
or
follow
him
to
the
death
lincoln
telegraphed
to
grant
quoting
this
despatch
and
adding
this
i
think
is
exactly
right
but
please
look
over
the
despatches
you
may
have
received
from
here
even
since
you
made
that
order
and
see
if
there
is
any
idea
in
the
head
of
any
one
here
of
putting
our
army
south
of
the
enemy
or
following
him
to
the
death
in
any
direction
i
repeat
to
you
it
will
neither
be
done
nor
attempted
unless
you
watch
it
every
day
and
hour
and
force
it
grant
now
came
to
hunter
army
and
gently
placed
sheridan
in
that
general
place
the
operations
of
that
autumn
which
established
sheridan
fame
and
culminated
in
his
final
defeat
of
early
at
cedar
creek
on
october
made
him
master
of
all
the
lower
part
of
the
valley
before
he
retired
into
winter
quarters
he
had
so
laid
waste
the
resources
of
that
unfortunate
district
that
richmond
could
no
longer
draw
supplies
from
it
nor
could
it
again
support
a
southern
army
in
a
sally
against
the
north
in
the
month
of
november
sherman
began
a
new
and
extraordinary
movement
of
which
the
conception
was
all
his
own
sanctioned
with
reluctance
by
grant
and
viewed
with
anxiety
by
lincoln
though
he
maintained
his
absolute
resolve
not
to
interfere
he
had
fortified
himself
in
atlanta
removing
its
civil
inhabitants
in
an
entirely
humane
fashion
to
places
of
safety
and
he
had
secured
a
little
rest
for
his
army
but
he
lay
far
south
in
the
heart
of
what
he
called
jeff
davis
empire
and
hood
could
continually
harass
him
by
attacks
on
his
communications
hood
now
supervised
by
beauregard
was
gathering
reinforcements
and
sherman
learnt
that
he
contemplated
a
diversion
by
invading
tennessee
sherman
determined
to
divide
his
forces
to
send
thomas
far
back
into
tennessee
with
sufficient
men
as
he
calculated
to
defend
it
and
himself
with
the
rest
of
his
army
to
set
out
for
the
eastern
wasting
no
men
on
the
maintenance
of
his
communications
but
living
on
the
country
and
making
the
people
of
georgia
feel
the
weight
of
the
war
he
set
out
for
the
east
on
november
hood
at
beauregard
orders
shortly
marched
off
for
the
north
where
the
cautious
thomas
awaited
events
within
the
fortifications
of
nashville
at
franklin
in
the
heart
of
tennessee
about
twenty
miles
south
of
nashville
hood
army
suffered
badly
in
an
attack
upon
general
schofield
whom
thomas
had
left
to
check
his
advance
while
further
reinforcements
came
to
nashville
schofield
fell
back
slowly
on
thomas
hood
rashly
pressing
after
him
with
a
small
but
veteran
army
now
numbering
grant
and
the
washington
authorities
viewed
with
much
concern
an
invasion
which
thomas
had
suffered
to
proceed
so
far
grant
had
not
shared
sherman
faith
in
thomas
he
now
repeatedly
urged
him
to
act
but
thomas
had
his
own
views
and
obstinately
bided
his
time
days
followed
when
frozen
sleet
made
an
advance
impossible
grant
had
already
sent
logan
to
supersede
thomas
and
growing
still
more
anxious
had
started
to
come
west
himself
when
the
news
reached
him
of
a
battle
on
december
and
in
which
thomas
had
fallen
on
hood
completely
routing
him
taking
on
these
days
and
in
the
pursuit
that
followed
no
less
than
prisoners
there
was
a
song
as
we
go
marching
through
georgia
which
was
afterwards
famous
and
which
sherman
could
not
endure
what
his
men
most
often
sang
while
they
actually
were
marching
through
georgia
was
another
and
of
its
kind
a
great
song
john
brown
body
lies
amouldering
in
the
grave
but
his
soul
goes
marching
on
glory
glory
hallelujah
their
progress
was
of
the
nature
of
a
frolic
though
in
one
way
a
very
stern
frolic
they
had
little
trouble
from
the
small
and
scattered
confederate
forces
that
lay
near
their
route
they
industriously
and
ingeniously
destroyed
the
railway
track
of
the
south
heating
the
rails
and
twisting
them
into
knots
and
the
rich
country
of
georgia
which
had
become
the
chief
granary
of
the
confederates
was
devastated
as
they
passed
for
a
space
fifty
or
sixty
miles
broad
by
the
destruction
of
all
the
produce
they
could
not
consume
this
was
done
under
control
by
organised
forage
parties
reasonable
measures
were
taken
to
prevent
private
pillage
of
houses
no
doubt
it
happened
sherman
able
cavalry
commander
earned
a
bad
name
and
uncle
billy
as
they
called
him
to
his
face
clearly
had
a
soft
corner
in
his
heart
for
the
and
gentlemen
called
bummers
a
bummer
says
the
oxford
dictionary
is
one
who
quits
the
ranks
and
goes
on
an
independent
foraging
expedition
on
his
own
account
they
were
incidentally
sherman
found
good
scouts
but
the
serious
crimes
committed
were
very
few
judged
by
the
standard
of
the
ordinary
civil
population
the
authentic
complaints
recorded
relate
to
such
matters
as
the
smashing
of
a
grand
piano
or
the
disappearance
of
some
fine
old
madeira
thus
the
suffering
caused
to
individuals
was
probably
not
extreme
and
a
long
continuance
of
the
war
was
rendered
almost
impossible
a
little
before
christmas
day
sherman
had
captured
with
slight
opposition
the
city
of
savannah
on
the
atlantic
with
many
guns
and
other
spoils
and
was
soon
ready
to
turn
northwards
on
the
last
lap
of
his
triumphant
course
lincoln
letter
of
thanks
characteristically
confessed
his
earlier
unexpressed
and
unfulfilled
fears
grant
was
proceeding
all
the
time
with
his
pressure
on
the
single
large
fortress
which
richmond
and
petersburg
together
constituted
its
circuit
was
far
too
great
for
complete
investment
his
efforts
were
for
a
time
directed
to
seizing
the
three
railway
lines
which
converged
from
the
south
on
petersburg
and
to
that
extent
cutting
off
the
supplies
of
the
enemy
but
he
failed
to
get
hold
of
the
most
important
of
these
railways
he
settled
down
to
the
slow
process
of
entrenching
his
own
lines
securely
and
extending
the
entrenchment
further
and
further
round
the
south
side
of
petersburg
lee
was
thus
being
forced
to
extend
the
position
held
by
his
own
small
army
further
and
further
in
time
the
lines
would
crack
and
the
end
come
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
despair
was
invading
the
remnant
of
the
confederacy
supplies
began
to
run
short
in
richmond
recruiting
had
ceased
desertion
was
increasing
before
the
story
of
its
long
resistance
closes
it
is
better
to
face
the
gravest
charge
against
the
south
that
charge
relates
to
the
misery
inflicted
upon
many
thousands
of
northern
prisoners
in
certain
prisons
or
detention
camps
of
the
south
the
alleged
horrors
were
real
and
were
great
the
details
should
not
be
commemorated
but
it
is
right
to
observe
that
the
pitiable
condition
in
which
the
stricken
survivors
of
this
captivity
returned
and
the
tale
they
had
to
tell
caused
the
bitterness
which
might
be
noted
afterwards
in
some
northerners
the
guilt
lay
mainly
with
a
few
subordinate
but
uncontrolled
officials
in
some
degree
it
must
have
been
shared
by
jefferson
davis
and
his
administration
though
a
large
allowance
should
be
made
for
men
so
sorely
driven
but
it
affords
no
ground
whatever
as
more
fortunate
prisoners
taken
by
the
confederates
have
sometimes
testified
for
any
general
imputation
of
cruelty
against
the
southern
officers
soldiers
or
people
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
war
which
dishonours
the
south
nothing
to
restrain
the
tribute
to
its
heroism
which
is
due
from
a
foreign
writer
and
which
is
irrepressible
in
the
case
of
a
writer
who
rejoices
that
the
confederacy
failed
second
election
of
lincoln
having
the
general
for
whom
he
had
long
sought
lincoln
could
now
be
in
military
matters
little
more
than
the
most
intelligent
onlooker
he
could
maintain
the
attitude
congenial
to
him
where
he
dealt
with
skilled
men
that
when
he
differed
from
them
they
probably
knew
better
than
he
this
was
well
for
in
his
political
anxieties
became
greater
than
they
had
been
since
war
declared
itself
at
fort
sumter
whole
states
which
had
belonged
to
the
confederacy
were
now
securely
held
by
the
union
armies
and
the
difficult
problem
of
their
government
was
approaching
its
final
settlement
it
seemed
that
the
war
should
soon
end
so
the
question
of
peace
was
pressed
urgently
moreover
the
election
of
a
president
was
due
in
the
autumn
and
strange
as
it
is
the
issue
was
to
be
whether
with
victory
in
their
grasp
the
victors
should
themselves
surrender
it
was
not
given
to
lincoln
after
all
to
play
a
great
part
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
south
that
was
reserved
for
much
rougher
and
much
weaker
hands
but
the
lines
on
which
he
had
moved
from
the
first
are
of
interest
west
virginia
with
its
solid
unionist
population
was
simply
allowed
to
form
itself
into
an
ordinary
new
state
but
matters
were
not
so
simple
where
the
northern
occupation
was
insecure
or
where
a
tiny
fraction
of
a
state
was
held
or
where
a
large
part
of
the
people
leaned
to
the
confederacy
military
governors
were
of
course
appointed
in
tennessee
this
position
was
given
to
a
strong
unionist
andrew
johnson
who
was
already
senator
for
that
state
in
louisiana
and
elsewhere
lincoln
encouraged
the
citizens
who
would
unreservedly
accept
the
union
to
organise
state
governments
for
themselves
where
they
did
so
there
was
friction
between
them
and
the
northern
military
governor
who
was
still
indispensable
there
was
also
to
the
end
triangular
trouble
between
the
factions
in
missouri
and
the
general
commanding
there
to
these
little
difficulties
which
were
of
course
unceasing
lincoln
applied
the
firmness
and
tact
which
were
no
longer
surprising
in
him
with
a
pleasing
mixture
of
good
temper
and
healthy
irritation
but
further
difficulties
lay
in
the
attitude
of
congress
which
was
concerned
in
the
matter
because
each
house
could
admit
or
reject
the
senators
or
representatives
claiming
to
sit
for
a
southern
state
there
were
questions
about
slavery
in
such
states
lincoln
as
we
have
seen
had
desired
if
he
could
to
bring
about
the
abolition
of
slavery
through
gradual
and
through
local
action
and
he
had
wished
to
see
the
franchise
given
only
to
the
few
educated
negroes
nothing
came
of
this
but
it
kept
up
the
suspicion
of
radicals
in
congress
that
he
was
not
sound
on
slavery
and
apart
from
slavery
the
whole
question
of
the
terms
on
which
people
lately
in
arms
against
the
country
could
be
admitted
as
participators
in
the
government
of
the
country
was
one
on
which
statesmen
in
congress
had
their
own
very
important
point
of
view
lincoln
main
wish
was
that
with
the
greatest
speed
and
the
least
heat
spent
on
avoidable
controversy
state
government
of
spontaneous
local
growth
should
spring
up
in
the
reconquered
south
in
all
available
ways
he
had
written
to
one
of
his
military
governors
give
the
people
a
chance
to
express
their
wishes
at
these
elections
follow
forms
of
law
as
far
as
convenient
but
at
all
events
get
the
expression
of
the
largest
number
of
people
possible
above
all
he
was
afraid
lest
in
the
southern
elections
to
congress
that
very
thing
should
happen
which
after
his
death
did
happen
to
send
a
parcel
of
northern
men
here
as
representatives
elected
as
would
be
understood
and
perhaps
really
so
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
would
be
disgraceful
and
outrageous
for
a
time
he
and
congress
worked
together
well
enough
but
sharp
disagreement
arose
in
he
had
propounded
a
particular
plan
for
the
reconstruction
of
southern
states
senator
wade
the
formidable
chairman
of
the
joint
committee
on
the
war
and
henry
winter
davis
a
keen
acrid
and
fluent
man
who
was
powerful
with
the
house
carried
a
bill
under
which
a
state
could
only
be
reconstructed
on
their
own
plan
which
differed
from
lincoln
the
bill
came
to
lincoln
for
signature
in
the
last
hours
of
the
session
and
amidst
frightened
protests
from
friendly
legislators
then
in
his
room
he
let
it
lie
there
unsigned
till
it
expired
with
the
session
and
went
on
with
his
work
this
was
in
july
his
was
at
stake
the
democrats
were
gaining
ground
he
might
be
giving
extreme
offence
to
the
strongest
republican
if
they
choose
he
said
to
make
a
point
of
this
i
do
not
doubt
that
they
can
do
harm
indeed
those
powerful
men
wade
and
davis
now
declared
against
his
with
ability
and
extraordinary
bitterness
but
he
continued
at
all
events
i
must
keep
some
consciousness
of
being
somewhere
near
right
i
must
keep
some
standard
or
principle
fixed
within
myself
the
bill
would
have
repressed
loyal
efforts
already
made
to
establish
state
governments
in
the
south
it
contained
also
a
provision
imposing
the
abolition
of
slavery
on
every
such
reconstructed
state
this
was
an
attempt
to
remedy
any
flaw
in
the
constitutional
effect
of
the
proclamation
of
emancipation
but
it
was
certainly
in
itself
flagrantly
unconstitutional
and
the
only
conclusive
way
of
abolishing
slavery
was
the
constitutional
amendment
for
which
lincoln
was
now
anxious
this
was
not
a
pedantic
point
for
there
might
have
been
great
trouble
if
the
courts
had
later
found
a
constitutional
flaw
in
some
negro
title
to
freedom
but
the
correctness
of
lincoln
view
hardly
matters
in
lots
of
little
things
like
a
tired
man
who
was
careless
by
nature
lincoln
may
perhaps
have
yielded
to
influence
or
acted
for
his
political
convenience
in
ways
which
may
justly
be
censured
but
it
would
be
merely
immoral
to
care
whether
he
did
so
or
did
not
since
at
the
crisis
of
his
fate
he
could
risk
all
for
one
scruple
in
an
earlier
stage
of
his
controversies
with
the
parties
he
had
written
from
time
to
time
i
have
done
and
said
what
appeared
to
me
proper
to
do
and
say
the
public
knows
it
all
it
obliges
nobody
to
follow
me
and
i
trust
it
obliges
me
to
follow
nobody
the
radicals
and
conservatives
each
agree
with
me
in
some
things
and
disagree
in
others
i
could
wish
both
to
agree
with
me
in
all
things
for
then
they
would
agree
with
each
other
and
be
too
strong
for
any
foe
from
any
quarter
they
however
choose
to
do
otherwise
and
i
do
not
question
their
right
i
too
shall
do
what
seems
to
be
my
duty
i
hold
whoever
commands
in
missouri
or
elsewhere
responsible
to
me
and
not
to
either
radicals
or
conservatives
it
is
my
duty
to
hear
all
but
at
last
i
must
within
my
sphere
judge
what
to
do
and
what
to
forbear
in
this
same
month
of
july
after
the
confederate
general
appearance
before
washington
had
given
lincoln
a
pause
from
political
cares
another
trouble
reached
a
point
at
which
it
is
known
to
have
tried
his
patience
more
than
any
other
trouble
of
his
presidency
peace
after
war
is
not
always
a
matter
of
substituting
the
diplomatist
for
the
soldier
when
two
sides
were
fighting
one
for
union
and
the
other
for
independence
one
or
the
other
had
to
surrender
the
whole
point
at
issue
in
this
case
there
might
appear
to
have
been
a
third
possibility
the
southern
states
might
have
been
invited
to
return
to
the
union
on
terms
which
admitted
their
right
to
secede
again
if
they
felt
aggrieved
the
invitation
would
in
fact
have
been
refused
but
if
it
had
been
made
and
accepted
this
would
have
been
a
worse
surrender
for
the
north
than
any
mere
acknowledgment
that
the
south
could
not
be
reconquered
for
national
unity
from
that
day
to
this
would
have
existed
on
the
sufferance
of
a
factious
or
a
foreign
majority
in
any
single
state
lincoln
had
faced
this
he
was
there
to
restore
the
union
on
a
firm
foundation
he
meant
to
insist
to
the
point
of
pedantry
that
by
not
so
much
as
a
word
or
line
from
the
president
or
any
one
seeming
to
act
for
him
should
the
lawful
right
of
secession
even
appear
to
be
acknowledged
some
men
would
have
been
glad
to
hang
jefferson
davis
as
a
traitor
yet
would
have
been
ready
to
negotiate
with
him
as
with
a
foreign
king
lincoln
who
would
not
have
hurt
one
hair
of
his
head
and
would
have
talked
things
over
with
davis
quite
pleasantly
would
have
died
rather
than
treat
with
him
on
the
footing
that
he
was
head
of
an
independent
confederacy
the
blood
shed
might
have
been
shed
for
nothing
if
he
had
done
so
but
to
many
men
in
the
long
agony
of
the
war
and
its
disappointments
the
plain
position
became
much
obscured
the
idea
in
various
forms
that
by
some
sort
of
negotiation
the
issue
could
be
evaded
began
to
assert
itself
again
and
again
the
delusion
was
freely
propagated
that
the
south
was
ready
to
give
in
if
only
lincoln
would
encourage
its
approaches
it
was
sheer
delusion
jefferson
davis
said
frankly
to
the
last
that
the
confederacy
would
have
independence
or
extermination
and
though
stephens
and
many
others
spoke
of
peace
to
the
electors
in
their
own
states
jefferson
davis
had
his
army
with
him
and
the
only
result
which
agitation
against
him
ever
produced
was
that
two
months
before
the
irreparable
collapse
the
chief
command
under
him
was
given
to
his
most
faithful
servant
lee
but
it
was
useless
for
lincoln
to
expose
the
delusion
in
the
plainest
terms
it
survived
exposure
and
became
a
danger
to
northern
unity
lincoln
therefore
took
a
strange
course
which
generally
succeeded
when
honest
men
came
to
him
and
said
that
the
south
could
be
induced
to
yield
he
proposed
to
them
that
they
should
go
to
jefferson
davis
and
see
for
themselves
the
chairman
of
the
republican
organisation
ultimately
approached
lincoln
on
this
matter
at
the
request
of
a
strong
committee
but
he
was
a
sensible
man
whom
lincoln
at
once
converted
by
drafting
the
precise
message
that
would
have
to
be
sent
to
the
confederate
president
on
two
earlier
occasions
such
labourers
for
peace
were
allowed
to
go
across
the
lines
and
talk
with
davis
it
could
be
trusted
to
their
honour
to
pretend
to
no
authority
they
had
interesting
talks
with
the
great
enemy
and
made
religious
appeals
to
him
or
entertained
him
with
wild
proposals
for
a
joint
war
on
france
over
mexico
they
returned
converted
also
but
in
july
horace
greeley
the
great
editor
who
was
too
opinionated
to
be
quite
honest
was
somehow
convinced
that
southern
agents
at
niagara
who
had
really
come
to
hold
intercourse
with
the
disloyal
group
among
the
democrats
were
two
ambassadors
from
the
confederacy
seeking
an
audience
of
lincoln
he
wrote
to
lincoln
begging
him
to
receive
them
lincoln
caused
greeley
to
go
to
niagara
and
see
the
supposed
ambassadors
himself
he
gave
him
written
authority
to
bring
to
him
any
person
with
proper
credentials
provided
as
he
made
plain
in
terms
that
perhaps
were
blunt
that
the
basis
of
any
negotiation
should
include
the
recognition
of
the
union
and
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
persons
whom
greeley
saw
had
no
authority
to
treat
about
anything
greeley
in
his
irritation
now
urged
lincoln
to
convey
to
jefferson
davis
through
these
mysterious
men
his
readiness
to
receive
them
if
they
were
accredited
in
other
words
the
north
was
to
begin
suing
for
peace
a
thing
clearly
unwise
which
lincoln
refused
greeley
now
involved
lincoln
in
a
tangled
controversy
to
which
he
gave
such
a
turn
that
unless
lincoln
would
publish
the
most
passionately
pacific
of
letters
to
the
great
discouragement
of
the
public
with
whom
greeley
counted
he
must
himself
keep
silent
on
what
had
passed
he
elected
to
keep
silent
while
greeley
in
his
paper
criticised
him
as
the
person
responsible
for
the
continuance
of
senseless
bloodshed
this
was
publicly
harmful
and
as
for
its
private
bearing
the
reputation
of
obstinate
was
certain
to
be
painful
to
lincoln
the
history
of
lincoln
cabinet
has
a
bearing
upon
what
is
to
follow
he
ruled
his
ministers
with
undisputed
authority
talked
with
them
collectively
upon
the
easiest
terms
spoke
to
them
as
a
headmaster
to
his
school
when
they
caballed
against
one
another
kept
them
in
some
sort
of
unison
in
a
manner
which
astonished
all
who
knew
them
cameron
had
had
to
retire
early
so
did
the
caleb
smith
who
was
succeeded
in
his
unimportant
office
as
secretary
of
the
interior
by
a
mr
usher
who
seems
to
have
been
well
chosen
bates
the
retired
weary
of
his
work
towards
the
end
of
and
lincoln
had
the
keen
pleasure
of
appointing
james
speed
the
brother
of
that
unforgotten
and
greatly
honoured
friend
whom
he
honoured
the
more
for
his
contentedness
with
private
station
james
speed
himself
was
in
opinion
an
honest
man
and
a
gentleman
and
one
of
those
men
not
too
common
here
who
are
not
spoiled
by
a
big
office
blair
might
be
regarded
as
a
delightful
or
equally
as
an
intolerable
man
he
attacked
all
manner
of
people
causelessly
and
violently
and
earned
implacable
dislike
from
the
radicals
in
his
party
then
he
frankly
asked
lincoln
to
dismiss
him
whenever
it
was
convenient
there
came
a
time
when
lincoln
was
in
great
peril
and
he
might
it
was
urged
have
made
it
sure
by
dismissing
blair
it
is
significant
that
lincoln
then
refused
to
promote
his
own
cause
by
seeming
to
sacrifice
blair
but
later
on
when
his
own
election
was
fairly
certain
but
a
greater
degree
of
unity
in
the
republican
party
was
to
be
gained
did
ask
blair
to
go
blair
quarrels
it
should
be
added
had
become
more
and
more
outrageous
so
he
went
and
immediately
flung
himself
with
enthusiasm
into
the
advocacy
of
lincoln
cause
all
the
men
who
left
lincoln
remained
his
friends
except
one
who
will
shortly
concern
us
of
lincoln
more
important
ministers
welles
did
his
work
for
the
navy
industriously
but
unnoted
stanton
on
the
other
hand
and
relations
with
stanton
are
the
subjects
of
many
pages
of
literature
these
two
curious
and
seemingly
incompatible
men
hit
upon
extraordinary
methods
of
working
together
it
can
be
seen
that
lincoln
chief
care
in
dealing
with
his
subordinates
was
to
give
support
and
to
give
free
play
to
any
man
whose
heart
was
in
his
work
in
countless
small
matters
he
would
let
stanton
disobey
him
and
flout
him
openly
did
stanton
tell
you
i
was
a
damned
fool
then
i
expect
i
must
be
one
for
he
is
almost
always
right
and
generally
says
what
he
means
but
every
now
and
then
when
he
cared
much
about
his
own
wish
he
would
step
in
and
crush
stanton
flat
crowds
of
applicants
to
lincoln
with
requests
of
a
kind
that
must
be
granted
sparingly
were
passed
on
to
stanton
pleased
with
the
president
or
mystified
by
his
sadly
observing
that
he
had
not
much
influence
with
this
administration
but
hoped
to
have
more
with
the
next
stanton
always
refused
them
he
enjoyed
doing
it
yet
it
seems
a
low
trick
to
have
thus
indulged
his
taste
for
unpopularity
till
one
discovers
that
when
stanton
might
have
been
blamed
seriously
and
unfairly
lincoln
was
very
careful
to
shoulder
the
blame
himself
the
gist
of
their
mutual
dealings
was
that
the
hated
stanton
received
a
thinly
disguised
but
quite
unfailing
support
and
that
hated
or
applauded
ill
or
well
wrong
in
this
detail
and
right
in
that
he
abode
in
his
department
and
drove
and
drove
and
drove
and
worshipped
lincoln
to
seward
who
played
first
and
last
a
notable
part
in
history
and
who
all
this
time
conducted
foreign
affairs
under
lincoln
without
any
mishap
in
the
end
one
tribute
is
due
when
he
had
not
a
master
it
is
said
that
his
abilities
were
made
useless
by
his
egotism
yet
it
can
be
seen
that
with
his
especial
cause
to
be
jealous
of
lincoln
he
could
not
even
conceive
how
men
let
private
jealousy
divide
them
in
the
performance
of
duty
it
was
otherwise
with
the
ablest
man
in
the
cabinet
salmon
chase
must
really
have
been
a
good
man
in
the
days
before
he
fell
in
love
with
his
own
goodness
lincoln
and
the
country
had
confidence
in
his
management
of
the
treasury
and
lincoln
thought
more
highly
of
his
general
ability
than
of
that
of
any
other
man
about
him
he
for
his
part
distrusted
and
despised
lincoln
those
who
read
important
letters
and
speeches
see
in
him
at
once
a
great
gentleman
there
were
but
few
among
the
really
men
of
america
who
made
much
of
his
lacking
some
of
the
minor
points
of
gentility
to
which
most
of
them
were
born
but
of
these
few
chase
betrayed
himself
as
one
at
the
beginning
of
chase
was
putting
it
about
that
he
had
himself
no
wish
to
be
president
but
that
of
course
he
was
loyal
to
lincoln
but
and
so
forth
he
had
as
indeed
he
deserved
admirers
who
wished
he
should
be
president
and
early
in
the
year
some
of
them
expressed
this
wish
in
a
manifesto
chase
wrote
to
lincoln
that
this
was
not
his
own
doing
lincoln
replied
that
he
himself
knew
as
little
of
these
things
as
my
friends
will
allow
me
to
know
to
those
who
spoke
to
him
of
intrigues
he
only
said
that
chase
would
in
some
ways
make
a
very
good
president
and
he
hoped
they
would
never
have
a
worse
president
than
he
the
movement
in
favour
of
chase
collapsed
very
soon
and
it
evidently
had
no
effect
on
lincoln
chase
however
was
beginning
to
foster
grievances
of
his
own
against
lincoln
these
related
always
to
appointments
in
the
service
of
the
treasury
he
professed
a
horror
of
party
influences
in
appointments
and
imputed
corrupt
motives
to
lincoln
in
such
matters
he
shared
the
sound
ideas
of
the
later
civil
service
reformers
though
he
was
far
too
easily
managed
by
a
low
class
of
flatterers
to
have
been
of
the
least
use
in
carrying
them
out
lincoln
would
certainly
not
at
that
crisis
have
permitted
strife
over
civil
service
reform
but
some
of
his
admirers
have
probably
gone
too
far
in
claiming
him
as
a
sturdy
supporter
of
the
old
school
who
would
despise
the
reforming
idea
letters
of
his
much
earlier
betray
his
doubts
as
to
the
old
system
and
he
was
exactly
the
man
who
in
quieter
times
could
have
improved
matters
with
the
least
possible
fuss
however
that
may
be
all
the
tiresome
circumstances
of
chase
differences
with
him
are
well
known
and
in
these
instances
lincoln
was
clearly
in
the
right
and
chase
quarrelled
only
because
he
could
not
force
upon
him
appointments
that
would
have
created
fury
once
chase
was
overruled
and
wrote
his
resignation
lincoln
went
to
him
with
the
resignation
in
his
hand
treated
him
with
simple
affection
for
a
man
whom
he
still
liked
and
made
him
take
it
back
later
on
chase
got
his
own
way
on
the
whole
but
was
angry
and
sent
another
resignation
some
one
heard
of
it
and
came
to
lincoln
to
say
that
the
loss
of
chase
would
cause
a
financial
panic
lincoln
answer
was
to
this
effect
chase
thinks
he
has
become
indispensable
to
the
country
that
his
intimate
friends
know
it
and
he
can
not
comprehend
why
the
country
does
not
understand
it
he
also
thinks
he
ought
to
be
president
has
no
doubt
whatever
about
that
it
is
inconceivable
to
him
why
people
do
not
rise
as
one
man
and
say
so
he
is
a
great
statesman
and
at
the
bottom
a
patriot
ordinarily
he
discharges
the
duties
of
a
public
office
with
greater
ability
than
any
man
i
know
mind
i
say
but
he
has
become
irritable
uncomfortable
so
that
he
is
never
perfectly
happy
unless
he
is
thoroughly
miserable
and
able
to
make
everybody
else
just
as
uncomfortable
as
he
is
himself
he
is
either
determined
to
annoy
me
or
that
i
shall
pat
him
on
the
shoulder
and
coax
him
to
stay
i
do
think
i
ought
to
do
it
i
will
not
do
it
i
will
take
him
at
his
word
so
he
did
this
was
at
the
end
of
june
when
lincoln
apprehensions
about
his
own
were
keen
and
the
resignation
of
chase
along
with
the
retention
of
blair
seemed
likely
to
provoke
anger
which
was
very
dangerous
to
himself
an
excellent
successor
to
the
indispensable
man
was
soon
found
chase
found
more
satisfaction
than
ever
in
insidious
opposition
to
lincoln
lincoln
opportunity
of
requiting
him
was
not
yet
the
question
of
the
presidency
loomed
large
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
to
the
election
in
november
at
first
while
the
affairs
of
war
seemed
to
be
in
good
train
the
chief
question
was
who
should
be
the
republican
candidate
it
was
obviously
not
a
time
when
a
president
of
even
moderate
ability
and
character
with
all
the
threads
in
his
hands
could
wisely
have
been
replaced
except
for
overwhelming
reasons
but
since
when
jackson
had
been
the
practice
of
giving
a
president
a
second
term
had
lapsed
it
has
been
seen
that
there
was
friction
not
wholly
unnatural
between
lincoln
and
many
of
his
party
the
inner
circles
of
politicians
were
considering
what
candidate
could
carry
the
country
they
were
doing
so
with
great
anxiety
for
disaffection
was
growing
serious
in
the
north
and
the
democrats
would
make
a
good
fight
they
honestly
doubted
whether
lincoln
was
the
best
candidate
and
attributed
their
own
excited
mood
of
criticism
to
the
public
at
large
they
forgot
the
leaning
of
ordinary
men
towards
one
who
is
already
serving
them
honestly
of
the
other
possible
candidates
including
chase
frémont
had
the
most
energetic
backers
enough
has
been
said
already
of
his
delusive
attractiveness
general
butler
had
also
some
support
he
was
an
impostor
of
a
coarser
but
more
useful
stamp
a
successful
advocate
in
massachusetts
he
had
commanded
the
militia
of
the
state
when
they
first
appeared
on
the
scene
at
baltimore
in
and
he
had
been
in
evidence
ever
since
without
sufficient
opportunity
till
may
of
proving
that
real
military
incapacity
of
which
some
of
friends
suspected
him
he
had
a
kind
of
resourceful
impudence
coupled
with
executive
vigour
and
a
good
deal
of
wit
which
had
made
him
useful
in
the
less
martial
duties
of
his
command
generals
in
a
war
of
this
character
were
often
so
placed
that
they
had
little
fighting
to
do
and
much
civil
government
and
butler
who
had
first
treated
slaves
as
contraband
and
had
dealt
with
his
difficulties
about
negroes
with
more
heart
and
more
sense
than
many
generals
had
to
some
extent
earned
his
reputation
among
the
republicans
thus
of
those
volunteer
generals
who
never
became
good
soldiers
he
is
said
to
have
been
the
only
one
that
escaped
the
constant
process
of
weeding
out
to
the
end
he
kept
confidently
claiming
higher
rank
in
the
army
and
when
he
had
signally
failed
under
grant
at
petersburg
he
succeeded
somehow
in
imposing
himself
upon
that
at
first
indignant
general
nothing
actually
came
of
the
danger
that
the
public
might
find
a
hero
in
this
man
who
was
neither
scrupulous
nor
able
but
he
had
so
captivated
experienced
politicians
that
some
continued
even
after
lincoln
to
think
butler
the
man
whom
the
people
would
have
preferred
last
but
not
least
many
were
anxious
to
nominate
grant
it
was
an
innocent
thought
but
merits
were
themselves
the
conclusive
reason
why
he
should
not
be
taken
from
the
work
he
had
already
in
hand
through
the
early
months
of
the
year
the
active
politicians
earnestly
collogued
among
themselves
about
possible
candidates
and
it
seems
there
was
little
sign
among
them
of
that
general
confidence
in
lincoln
which
a
little
while
before
had
been
recognised
as
prevailing
in
the
country
in
may
the
small
and
section
of
the
radicals
who
favoured
frémont
organised
for
themselves
a
national
meeting
of
some
few
people
at
which
they
nominated
him
for
the
presidency
they
had
no
chance
of
success
but
they
might
have
helped
the
democrats
by
carrying
off
some
republican
votes
besides
there
are
of
course
men
who
having
started
as
extremists
in
one
direction
and
failed
will
go
over
to
the
opposite
extreme
rather
than
moderate
their
aims
months
later
when
a
republican
victory
of
some
sort
became
certain
unanimity
among
republicans
was
secured
for
some
passions
were
appeased
by
the
resignation
of
blair
and
frémont
was
prevailed
upon
to
withdraw
but
in
the
meantime
the
republican
party
had
sent
its
delegates
to
a
convention
at
baltimore
early
in
june
this
convention
met
in
a
comparatively
fortunate
hour
in
spite
of
the
open
disaffection
of
small
sections
the
northern
people
had
been
in
good
spirits
about
the
war
when
grant
set
out
to
overcome
lee
at
first
he
was
felt
to
be
progressing
pretty
well
and
though
the
reverse
at
cold
harbour
had
happened
a
few
days
before
the
size
of
that
mishap
was
not
yet
appreciated
ordinary
citizens
called
upon
now
and
then
to
decide
a
broad
and
grave
issue
often
judge
with
greater
calm
than
is
possible
to
any
but
the
best
of
the
politicians
and
the
journalists
indeed
some
serious
politicians
had
been
anxious
to
postpone
the
convention
justly
fearing
that
these
ignorant
delegates
were
not
yet
imbued
with
that
contempt
for
lincoln
which
they
had
worked
up
among
themselves
at
the
baltimore
convention
the
delegates
of
one
state
wanted
grant
but
the
nomination
of
lincoln
was
immediate
and
almost
unanimous
this
same
convention
declared
for
a
constitutional
amendment
to
abolish
slavery
lincoln
would
say
nothing
as
to
the
choice
of
a
candidate
for
the
he
was
right
but
the
result
was
most
unhappy
in
the
end
the
convention
chose
andrew
johnson
johnson
whom
lincoln
could
hardly
endure
began
life
as
a
journeyman
tailor
he
had
raised
himself
like
lincoln
and
had
performed
a
great
part
in
rallying
the
unionists
of
tennessee
but
not
to
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
drunk
when
he
was
sworn
in
as
his
political
creed
was
that
of
bitter
and
his
character
degenerated
into
a
weak
and
brutal
obstinacy
this
man
was
to
succeed
lincoln
lincoln
in
his
letter
to
accept
the
nomination
wrote
modestly
refusing
to
take
the
decision
of
the
convention
as
a
tribute
to
his
peculiar
fitness
for
his
post
but
was
reminded
in
this
connection
of
a
story
of
an
old
dutch
farmer
who
remarked
to
a
companion
that
it
was
not
best
to
swap
horses
when
crossing
a
stream
it
remained
possible
that
the
dissatisfied
republicans
would
revolt
later
and
put
another
champion
in
the
field
but
now
attention
turned
to
the
democrats
their
convention
was
to
meet
at
chicago
at
the
end
of
august
and
in
the
interval
the
north
entered
upon
the
period
of
deepest
mental
depression
that
came
to
it
during
the
war
it
is
startling
to
learn
now
that
in
the
course
of
that
year
when
the
confederacy
lay
like
a
nut
in
the
nutcrackers
when
the
crushing
of
its
resistance
might
indeed
require
a
little
stronger
pressure
than
was
expected
and
the
first
splitting
in
its
hard
substance
might
not
come
on
the
side
on
which
it
was
looked
for
but
when
no
wise
man
could
have
a
doubt
as
to
the
end
the
victorious
people
were
inclined
to
think
that
the
moment
had
come
for
giving
in
in
this
purpose
to
save
the
country
and
its
liberties
said
lincoln
no
class
of
people
seem
so
nearly
unanimous
as
the
soldiers
in
the
field
and
the
sailors
afloat
do
they
not
have
the
hardest
of
it
who
should
quail
while
they
do
not
yet
there
is
conclusive
authority
for
saying
that
there
was
now
more
quailing
in
the
north
than
there
had
ever
been
before
when
the
war
had
gone
on
long
checks
to
the
course
of
victory
shook
the
nerves
of
people
at
home
more
than
crushing
defeats
had
shaken
them
in
the
first
two
years
of
the
struggle
and
men
who
would
have
wrapped
the
word
surrender
in
periphrasis
went
about
with
surrender
in
their
hearts
thus
the
two
months
that
went
before
the
great
rally
of
the
democrats
at
chicago
were
months
of
good
omen
for
a
party
which
however
little
the
many
honourable
men
in
its
ranks
were
willing
to
face
the
fact
must
base
its
only
hope
upon
the
weakening
of
the
national
will
for
public
attention
was
turned
away
from
other
fields
of
war
and
fixed
upon
the
army
of
the
potomac
sherman
drove
back
johnston
and
routed
hood
farragut
at
mobile
enriched
the
annals
of
the
sea
but
what
told
upon
the
imagination
of
the
north
was
that
grant
earlier
progress
was
followed
by
the
definite
failure
of
his
original
enterprise
against
lee
army
by
northern
defeats
on
the
shenandoah
and
an
actual
dash
by
the
south
against
washington
by
the
further
failure
of
grant
first
assault
upon
petersburg
and
by
hideous
losses
and
some
demoralisation
in
his
army
the
candidate
that
the
democrats
would
put
forward
and
the
general
principle
of
their
political
strategy
were
well
known
many
weeks
before
their
convention
met
and
the
republicans
already
despaired
of
defeating
them
in
the
chicago
convention
there
were
men
apparently
less
reputable
in
character
than
their
frank
attitude
suggests
who
were
outspoken
against
the
war
their
leader
was
vallandigham
there
were
men
who
spoke
boldly
for
the
war
but
more
boldly
against
emancipation
and
the
faults
of
the
government
their
leader
was
seymour
talking
with
the
accent
of
dignity
and
of
patriotism
seymour
for
the
war
presided
over
the
convention
vallandigham
against
the
war
was
the
master
spirit
in
its
debates
it
was
hard
for
such
men
with
any
saving
of
conscience
to
combine
the
mode
of
combination
which
they
discovered
is
memorable
in
the
history
of
faction
first
they
adopted
a
platform
which
meant
peace
then
they
adopted
a
candidate
intended
to
symbolise
successful
war
they
resolved
that
this
convention
does
explicitly
declare
as
the
sense
of
the
american
people
that
after
four
years
of
failure
to
restore
the
union
by
the
experiment
of
war
justice
humanity
liberty
and
the
public
welfare
demand
that
immediate
efforts
be
made
for
a
cessation
of
hostilities
with
a
view
to
an
ultimate
convention
of
the
states
or
other
peaceable
means
to
the
end
that
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
peace
may
be
restored
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
union
of
the
states
the
fallacy
which
named
the
union
as
the
end
while
demanding
as
a
means
the
immediate
cessation
of
hostilities
needs
no
demonstration
the
resolution
was
thus
translated
resolved
that
the
war
is
a
failure
and
the
translation
had
that
trenchant
accuracy
which
is
often
found
in
american
popular
epigram
the
candidate
chosen
was
mcclellan
mcclellan
in
set
terms
repudiated
the
resolution
that
the
war
was
a
failure
and
then
accepted
the
candidature
he
meant
no
harm
to
the
cause
of
the
union
but
he
meant
no
definite
and
clearly
conceived
good
electors
might
now
vote
democratic
because
the
party
was
peaceful
or
because
the
candidate
was
a
warrior
the
turn
of
fortune
was
about
to
arrest
this
combination
in
the
really
formidable
progress
of
its
crawling
approach
to
power
perhaps
it
was
not
only
as
contemporary
observers
thought
events
in
the
field
that
began
within
a
few
days
to
make
havoc
with
the
schemes
of
mcclellan
and
his
managers
perhaps
if
the
patience
of
the
north
had
been
tried
a
little
longer
the
sense
of
the
people
would
still
have
recoiled
from
the
policy
of
the
democrats
which
had
now
been
defined
in
hard
outline
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
only
in
the
months
while
the
chicago
convention
was
still
impending
and
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
after
it
had
actually
taken
place
that
the
panic
of
the
republicans
lasted
but
during
that
time
the
alarm
among
them
was
very
great
whether
it
was
wholly
due
to
the
discouragement
of
the
people
about
the
war
or
originated
among
the
leaders
and
was
communicated
to
their
flock
sagacious
party
men
reported
from
their
own
neighbourhoods
that
there
was
no
chance
of
winning
the
election
in
one
quarter
or
another
there
was
talk
of
setting
aside
lincoln
and
compelling
grant
to
be
a
candidate
about
august
lincoln
was
told
by
thurlow
weed
the
greatest
of
party
managers
that
his
election
was
hopeless
ten
days
later
he
received
the
same
assurance
from
the
central
republican
committee
through
their
chairman
raymond
together
with
the
advice
that
he
should
make
overtures
for
peace
supposing
that
in
the
following
november
mcclellan
should
have
been
elected
and
that
in
the
following
march
he
should
have
come
into
office
with
the
war
unfinished
it
seems
now
hardly
credible
that
he
would
have
returned
to
slavery
or
at
least
disbanded
without
protection
the
negroes
who
were
now
serving
the
north
lincoln
however
seriously
believed
that
this
was
the
course
to
which
mcclellan
principles
and
those
of
his
party
committed
him
and
that
policy
and
honour
apart
this
would
have
been
for
military
reasons
fatal
mcclellan
had
repudiated
the
peace
resolution
but
his
followers
and
his
character
were
to
be
reckoned
with
rather
than
his
words
and
indeed
his
honest
principles
committed
him
deeply
to
some
attempt
to
reverse
lincoln
policy
as
to
slavery
and
he
clearly
must
have
been
driven
into
negotiations
with
the
south
the
confusion
which
must
inevitably
be
created
by
attempts
to
satisfy
the
south
when
it
was
in
no
humour
of
moderation
and
by
the
fury
which
yielding
would
have
provoked
in
half
the
people
of
the
north
was
well
and
tersely
described
by
grant
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
which
that
friend
published
in
support
of
lincoln
at
a
fair
at
philadelphia
for
the
help
of
the
wounded
lincoln
said
we
accepted
this
war
we
did
not
begin
it
we
accepted
it
for
an
object
and
when
that
object
is
accomplished
the
war
will
end
and
i
hope
to
god
that
it
will
never
end
until
that
object
is
accomplished
whatever
the
real
mind
of
mcclellan
and
of
the
average
democrat
may
have
been
it
was
not
this
and
the
posterity
of
may
succeed
in
an
election
but
never
in
war
or
the
making
of
lasting
peace
lincoln
looked
forward
with
happiness
after
he
was
actually
to
the
quieter
pursuits
of
private
life
which
might
await
him
in
four
years
time
he
looked
forward
not
less
happily
to
a
period
of
peace
administration
first
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
prized
as
much
as
any
man
the
highest
honour
that
his
countrymen
could
bestow
a
second
election
to
the
presidency
but
even
in
a
smaller
man
who
had
passed
through
such
an
experience
as
he
had
and
was
not
warped
by
power
these
personal
wishes
might
well
have
been
merged
in
concern
for
the
cause
in
hand
there
is
everything
to
indicate
that
they
were
completely
so
in
his
case
a
president
can
not
wisely
do
much
directly
to
promote
his
own
but
he
appears
to
have
done
singularly
little
at
the
beginning
of
when
the
end
of
the
war
seemed
near
and
the
election
of
a
republican
probable
he
may
well
have
thought
that
he
would
be
the
republican
candidate
but
he
had
faced
the
possible
choice
of
chase
very
placidly
and
of
grant
he
said
if
he
takes
richmond
let
him
have
the
presidency
it
was
another
matter
when
the
war
again
seemed
likely
to
drag
on
and
a
democratic
president
might
come
in
before
the
end
of
it
an
editor
who
visited
the
president
in
august
told
him
that
he
needed
some
weeks
of
rest
and
seclusion
but
he
said
i
can
not
fly
from
my
thoughts
i
do
not
think
it
is
personal
vanity
or
ambition
though
i
am
not
free
from
those
infirmities
but
i
can
not
but
feel
that
the
weal
or
woe
of
the
nation
will
be
decided
in
november
there
is
no
proposal
offered
by
any
wing
of
the
democratic
party
but
that
must
result
in
the
permanent
destruction
of
the
union
he
would
have
been
well
content
to
make
place
for
grant
if
grant
had
finished
his
work
but
that
work
was
delayed
and
then
lincoln
became
greatly
troubled
by
the
movement
to
force
grant
the
general
whom
he
had
at
last
found
into
politics
with
his
work
undone
for
all
would
have
been
lost
if
mcclellan
had
come
in
with
the
war
still
progressing
badly
lincoln
had
been
invited
in
june
to
a
gathering
in
honour
of
grant
got
up
with
the
thinly
disguised
object
of
putting
the
general
forward
as
his
rival
he
wrote
with
true
diplomacy
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
attend
i
approve
nevertheless
of
whatever
may
tend
to
strengthen
and
sustain
general
grant
and
the
noble
armies
now
under
his
command
he
and
his
brave
soldiers
are
now
in
the
midst
of
their
great
trial
and
i
trust
that
at
your
meeting
you
will
so
shape
your
good
words
that
they
may
turn
to
men
and
guns
moving
to
his
and
their
support
in
august
he
told
his
mind
plainly
to
grant
friend
eaton
he
never
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
grant
would
willingly
go
off
into
politics
with
the
military
situation
still
insecure
and
he
believed
that
no
possible
pressure
could
force
grant
to
do
so
but
on
this
latter
question
he
wished
to
make
himself
sure
with
a
view
to
future
military
measures
he
really
needed
to
be
sure
of
it
eaton
saw
grant
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
very
tactfully
brought
to
grant
notice
the
designs
of
his
friends
we
had
writes
eaton
been
talking
very
quietly
but
grant
reply
came
in
an
instant
and
with
a
violence
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
he
brought
his
clenched
fists
down
hard
on
the
strap
arms
of
his
camp
chair
do
it
they
ca
compel
me
to
do
it
emphatic
gesture
was
not
a
strong
point
with
grant
you
said
this
to
the
president
i
asked
said
grant
have
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
assure
the
president
of
my
opinion
i
consider
it
as
important
for
the
cause
that
he
should
be
elected
as
that
the
army
should
be
successful
in
the
field
i
told
you
said
lincoln
afterwards
they
could
not
get
him
to
run
till
he
had
closed
out
the
rebellion
since
the
great
danger
was
now
only
that
mcclellan
would
become
president
in
march
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
to
try
and
finish
the
war
before
then
raymond
advice
in
favour
of
negotiations
with
the
south
now
came
and
lincoln
mode
of
replying
to
this
has
been
noticed
rumours
were
afloat
that
if
mcclellan
won
in
november
there
would
be
an
attempt
to
bring
him
irregularly
into
power
at
once
lincoln
let
it
be
known
that
he
should
stay
at
his
post
at
all
costs
till
the
last
lawful
day
on
august
in
that
curious
way
in
which
deep
emotion
showed
itself
with
him
he
wrote
a
resolution
upon
a
paper
which
he
folded
and
asked
his
ministers
to
endorse
with
their
signatures
without
reading
it
they
all
wrote
their
names
on
the
back
of
it
ready
if
that
were
possible
to
commit
themselves
blindly
to
support
of
him
in
whatever
he
had
resolved
a
great
tribute
to
him
and
to
themselves
he
sealed
it
up
and
put
it
away
how
far
in
this
dark
time
the
confidence
of
the
people
had
departed
from
lincoln
no
one
can
tell
it
might
be
too
sanguine
a
view
of
the
world
to
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
proof
against
what
may
be
called
a
conspiracy
to
run
him
down
there
were
certainly
quarters
in
which
the
perception
of
his
worth
came
soon
and
remained
not
all
those
who
are
poor
or
roughly
brought
up
were
among
those
plain
men
whose
approval
lincoln
desired
and
often
expected
but
at
least
the
plain
man
does
exist
and
the
plain
people
did
read
lincoln
words
the
soldiers
of
the
armies
in
the
east
by
this
time
knew
lincoln
well
and
there
were
by
now
as
we
shall
see
in
every
part
of
the
north
honest
parents
who
had
gone
to
washington
and
entered
the
white
house
very
sad
and
came
out
very
happy
and
taken
their
report
of
him
home
no
less
could
there
be
found
among
those
to
whom
america
had
given
the
greatest
advantages
that
birth
and
upbringing
can
offer
families
in
which
when
lincoln
died
a
daughter
could
write
to
her
father
as
lady
harcourt
then
miss
lily
motley
wrote
i
echo
your
god
that
we
always
appreciated
him
before
he
was
taken
from
us
but
if
we
look
at
the
political
world
we
find
indeed
noble
exceptions
such
as
that
of
charles
sumner
among
those
who
had
been
honestly
perplexed
by
lincoln
attitude
on
slavery
we
have
to
allow
for
the
feelings
of
some
good
state
governor
who
had
come
to
him
with
a
tiresome
but
serious
proposition
and
been
adroitly
parried
with
an
untactful
and
coarse
apologue
yet
it
remains
to
be
said
that
a
thick
veil
woven
of
and
blinded
most
politicians
to
any
rare
quality
in
lincoln
and
blinded
them
to
what
was
due
in
decency
to
any
man
discharging
his
task
the
evidence
collected
by
rhodes
as
to
the
tone
prevailing
in
at
washington
and
among
those
in
touch
with
washington
suggests
that
strictly
political
society
was
on
the
average
as
poor
in
brain
and
heart
as
the
court
of
the
most
decadent
european
monarchy
it
presents
a
stern
picture
of
the
isolation
on
one
side
at
least
in
which
lincoln
had
to
live
and
work
a
little
before
this
crowning
period
of
lincoln
career
walt
whitman
described
him
as
a
man
in
the
streets
of
washington
could
see
him
if
he
chose
he
has
been
speaking
of
the
cavalry
escort
which
the
advisers
insisted
should
go
clanking
about
with
him
the
party
he
continues
makes
no
great
show
in
uniform
or
horses
lincoln
on
the
saddle
generally
rides
a
grey
horse
is
dressed
in
plain
black
somewhat
rusty
and
dusty
and
looks
about
as
ordinary
in
attire
as
the
commonest
man
the
entirely
unornamental
arouses
no
sensation
only
some
curious
stranger
stops
and
gazes
i
see
very
plainly
abraham
lincoln
dark
brown
face
with
the
lines
the
eyes
always
to
me
with
a
deep
latent
sadness
in
the
expression
we
have
got
so
that
we
exchange
bows
and
very
cordial
ones
sometimes
the
president
goes
and
comes
in
an
open
barouche
not
the
poet
intimates
a
very
smart
sometimes
one
of
his
sons
a
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
accompanies
him
riding
at
his
right
on
a
pony
they
passed
me
once
very
close
and
i
saw
the
president
in
the
face
fully
as
they
were
moving
slowly
and
his
look
though
abstracted
happened
to
be
directed
steadily
in
my
eye
he
bowed
and
smiled
but
far
beneath
his
smile
i
noticed
well
the
expression
i
have
alluded
to
none
of
the
artists
or
pictures
has
caught
the
deep
though
subtle
and
indirect
expression
of
this
man
face
there
is
something
else
there
one
of
the
great
portrait
painters
of
two
or
three
centuries
ago
is
needed
the
little
boy
on
the
pony
was
thomas
called
tad
a
constant
companion
of
his
father
little
leisure
now
dead
an
elder
boy
robert
has
lived
to
be
welcomed
as
ambassador
in
this
country
and
was
at
this
time
a
student
at
harvard
willie
a
clever
and
lovably
mischievous
child
the
chartered
libertine
of
the
white
house
for
a
little
while
had
died
at
the
age
of
twelve
in
the
early
days
of
when
his
father
was
getting
so
impatient
to
stir
mcclellan
into
action
these
and
a
son
who
had
long
before
died
in
infancy
were
the
only
children
of
and
lincoln
little
has
been
made
public
concerning
them
but
enough
to
convey
the
impression
of
a
wise
and
tender
father
trusted
by
his
children
and
delighting
in
them
john
nicolay
his
loyal
and
capable
secretary
and
the
delightful
john
hay
must
be
reckoned
on
the
cheerful
side
for
there
was
one
of
lincoln
daily
life
the
life
of
the
home
at
the
white
house
and
sometimes
in
summer
at
the
soldiers
home
near
washington
was
simple
and
in
his
own
case
not
in
that
of
his
guests
regardless
of
the
time
sufficiency
or
quality
of
meals
he
can
not
have
given
people
much
trouble
but
he
gave
some
to
the
guard
who
watched
him
themselves
keenly
watched
by
stanton
for
he
loved
if
he
could
to
walk
alone
from
his
midnight
conferences
at
the
war
department
to
the
white
house
or
the
soldiers
home
the
barest
history
of
the
events
with
which
he
dealt
is
proof
enough
of
long
and
hard
and
anxious
working
days
which
continued
with
hardly
a
break
through
four
years
in
that
history
many
a
complication
has
here
been
barely
glanced
at
or
clean
left
out
in
this
year
for
example
the
difficulty
about
france
and
mexico
and
the
failure
of
the
very
estimable
banks
in
texas
have
been
but
briefly
noted
and
there
must
be
remembered
in
addition
the
duty
of
a
president
to
be
accessible
to
all
people
a
duty
which
lincoln
especially
strove
to
fulfil
apart
from
formal
receptions
the
stream
of
callers
on
him
must
have
given
lincoln
many
compensations
for
its
huge
monotony
very
odd
and
sometimes
attractive
samples
of
human
nature
would
come
under
his
keen
eye
now
and
then
a
visitor
came
neither
with
a
troublesome
request
nor
for
form
sake
or
for
curiosity
but
in
simple
honesty
to
pay
a
tribute
of
loyalty
or
speak
a
word
of
good
cheer
which
lincoln
received
with
unfeigned
gratitude
farmers
and
folk
of
the
type
he
could
best
talk
with
came
and
had
more
time
than
he
ought
to
have
spared
bestowed
on
them
at
long
intervals
there
came
a
friend
of
very
different
days
some
ingenious
men
for
instance
fitted
out
dennis
hanks
in
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
sent
him
as
their
ambassador
to
plead
for
certain
political
offenders
it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
they
were
more
successful
than
they
deserved
though
stanton
intervened
and
dennis
when
he
had
seen
him
favoured
his
old
companion
the
president
with
advice
to
dismiss
that
minister
but
the
immense
variety
of
puzzling
requests
to
be
dealt
with
in
such
interviews
must
have
made
heavy
demands
upon
a
conscientious
and
a
kind
man
especially
if
his
conscience
and
his
kindness
were
in
small
matters
sometimes
at
variance
lincoln
sent
a
multitude
away
with
that
feeling
so
grateful
to
poor
people
that
at
least
they
had
received
such
hearing
as
it
was
possible
to
give
them
and
in
dealing
with
the
applications
which
imposed
the
greatest
strain
on
himself
he
made
an
ineffaceable
impression
upon
the
memory
of
his
countrymen
the
american
soldier
did
not
take
naturally
to
discipline
death
sentences
chiefly
for
desertion
or
for
sleeping
or
other
negligence
on
the
part
of
sentries
were
continually
being
passed
by
in
some
cases
or
at
some
period
these
used
to
come
before
the
president
on
a
stated
day
of
the
week
of
which
lincoln
would
often
speak
with
horror
he
was
continually
being
appealed
to
in
relation
to
such
sentences
by
the
father
or
mother
of
the
culprit
or
some
friend
at
one
time
it
may
be
he
was
too
ready
with
pardon
you
do
not
know
he
said
how
hard
it
is
to
let
a
human
being
die
when
you
feel
that
a
stroke
of
your
pen
will
save
him
butler
used
to
write
to
him
that
he
was
destroying
the
discipline
of
the
army
a
letter
of
his
to
meade
shows
clearly
that
later
at
least
he
did
not
wish
to
exercise
a
merely
cheap
and
inconsiderate
mercy
the
import
of
the
numberless
pardon
stories
really
is
that
he
would
spare
himself
no
trouble
to
enquire
and
to
intervene
wherever
he
could
rightly
give
scope
to
his
longing
for
clemency
a
congressman
might
force
his
way
into
his
bedroom
in
the
middle
of
the
night
rouse
him
from
his
sleep
to
bring
to
his
notice
extenuating
facts
that
had
been
overlooked
and
receive
the
decision
well
i
do
see
that
it
will
do
him
any
good
to
be
shot
it
is
related
that
william
scott
a
lad
from
a
farm
in
vermont
after
a
tremendous
march
in
the
peninsula
campaign
volunteered
to
do
double
guard
duty
to
spare
a
sick
comrade
slept
at
his
post
was
caught
and
was
under
sentence
of
death
when
the
president
came
to
the
army
and
heard
of
him
the
president
visited
him
chatted
about
his
home
looked
at
his
mother
photograph
and
so
forth
then
he
laid
his
hands
on
the
boy
shoulders
and
said
with
a
trembling
voice
my
boy
you
are
not
going
to
be
shot
i
believe
you
when
you
tell
me
that
you
could
not
keep
awake
i
am
going
to
trust
you
and
send
you
back
to
the
regiment
but
i
have
been
put
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
on
your
account
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
are
you
going
to
pay
my
bill
scott
told
afterwards
how
difficult
it
was
to
think
when
his
fixed
expectation
of
death
was
suddenly
changed
but
how
he
managed
to
master
himself
thank
lincoln
and
reckon
up
how
with
his
pay
and
what
his
parents
could
raise
by
mortgage
on
their
farm
and
some
help
from
his
comrades
he
might
pay
the
bill
if
it
were
not
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
dollars
but
it
is
a
great
deal
more
than
that
said
the
president
my
bill
is
a
very
large
one
your
friends
can
not
pay
it
nor
your
bounty
nor
the
farm
nor
all
your
comrades
there
is
only
one
man
in
the
world
who
can
pay
it
and
his
name
is
william
scott
if
from
this
day
william
scott
does
his
duty
so
that
when
he
comes
to
die
he
can
look
me
in
the
face
as
he
does
now
and
say
have
kept
my
promise
and
i
have
done
my
duty
as
a
soldier
then
my
debt
will
be
paid
will
you
make
the
promise
and
try
to
keep
it
and
william
scott
did
promise
and
not
very
long
after
he
was
desperately
wounded
and
he
died
but
not
before
he
could
send
a
message
to
the
president
that
he
had
tried
to
be
a
good
soldier
and
would
have
paid
his
debt
in
full
if
he
had
lived
and
that
he
died
thinking
of
lincoln
kind
face
and
thanking
him
for
the
chance
he
gave
him
to
fall
like
a
soldier
in
battle
if
the
story
is
not
true
and
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
doubt
it
still
it
is
a
remarkable
man
of
whom
people
spin
yarns
of
that
kind
when
lincoln
strength
became
visibly
tried
friends
often
sought
to
persuade
him
to
spare
himself
the
needless
and
to
him
very
often
harrowing
labour
of
incessant
interviews
they
never
succeeded
lincoln
told
them
he
could
not
forget
what
he
himself
would
feel
in
the
place
of
the
many
poor
souls
who
came
to
him
desiring
so
little
and
with
so
little
to
get
but
he
owned
to
the
severity
of
the
strain
he
was
not
too
sensitive
to
the
ridicule
and
reproach
that
surrounded
him
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
he
had
once
said
to
some
one
who
had
sympathised
with
him
over
some
such
annoyance
i
have
endured
a
great
deal
of
ridicule
without
much
malice
and
have
received
a
great
deal
of
kindness
not
quite
free
from
ridicule
i
am
used
to
it
but
the
gentle
nature
that
such
words
express
and
that
made
itself
deeply
felt
by
those
that
were
nearest
him
can
not
but
have
suffered
from
want
of
appreciation
with
all
this
added
to
the
larger
cares
which
before
the
closing
phases
of
the
war
opened
had
become
so
intense
lincoln
must
have
been
taxed
near
to
the
limit
of
what
men
have
endured
without
loss
of
judgment
or
loss
of
courage
or
loss
of
ordinary
human
feeling
there
is
no
sign
that
any
of
these
things
happened
to
him
the
study
of
his
record
rather
shows
a
steady
ripening
of
mind
and
character
to
the
end
it
has
been
seen
how
throughout
his
previous
life
the
melancholy
of
his
temperament
impressed
those
who
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
it
a
colleague
of
his
at
the
illinois
bar
has
told
how
on
circuit
he
sometimes
came
down
in
the
morning
and
found
lincoln
sitting
alone
over
the
embers
of
the
fire
where
he
had
sat
all
night
in
sad
meditation
after
an
evening
of
jest
apparently
none
the
less
hilarious
for
his
total
abstinence
there
was
no
scope
for
this
brooding
now
and
in
a
sense
the
time
of
his
severest
trial
can
not
have
been
the
saddest
time
of
life
it
must
have
been
a
cause
not
of
added
depression
but
of
added
strength
that
he
had
long
been
accustomed
to
face
the
sternest
aspect
of
the
world
he
had
within
his
own
mind
two
resources
often
perhaps
normally
associated
together
but
seldom
so
fully
combined
as
with
him
in
his
most
intimate
circle
he
would
draw
upon
his
stores
of
poetry
particularly
of
tragedy
often
for
instance
he
would
recite
such
speeches
as
richard
ii
for
god
sake
let
us
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
sad
stories
of
the
death
of
kings
all
murdered
slighter
acquaintances
saw
day
by
day
another
element
in
his
thoughts
the
companion
to
this
for
the
hardly
interrupted
play
of
humour
in
which
he
found
relief
continued
to
help
him
to
the
end
whatever
there
was
in
it
either
of
mannerism
or
of
coarseness
no
one
can
grudge
it
him
it
is
an
oddity
which
endears
the
humour
of
real
life
fades
in
reproduction
but
lincoln
there
is
no
doubt
was
a
vein
of
genuine
comedy
deep
rich
and
unsoured
of
a
larger
human
quality
than
marks
the
brilliant
works
of
literary
american
humorists
it
was
like
the
comedy
of
shakespeare
plainly
if
unaccountably
akin
with
the
graver
and
grander
strain
of
thought
and
feeling
that
inspired
the
greatest
of
his
speeches
physically
his
splendid
health
does
not
seem
to
have
been
impaired
beyond
recovery
but
it
was
manifestly
near
to
breaking
and
the
lines
were
cut
still
deeper
and
the
long
legs
were
always
cold
the
cloud
over
the
north
passed
very
suddenly
the
north
indeed
paid
the
penalty
of
a
nation
which
is
spared
the
full
strain
of
a
war
at
the
first
and
begins
to
discover
its
seriousness
when
the
hope
of
easy
victory
has
been
many
times
dashed
down
it
has
been
necessary
to
dwell
upon
the
despondency
which
at
one
time
prevailed
but
it
would
be
hard
to
rate
too
highly
the
military
difficulty
of
the
conquest
undertaken
by
the
north
or
the
trial
involved
to
human
nature
by
perseverance
in
such
a
task
if
the
depression
during
the
summer
was
excessive
as
it
clearly
was
at
least
the
recovery
which
followed
was
fully
adequate
to
the
occasion
which
produced
it
on
september
sherman
telegraphed
atlanta
is
ours
and
fairly
won
the
strategic
importance
of
earlier
successes
may
have
been
greater
but
the
most
ignorant
man
who
looked
at
a
map
could
see
what
it
signified
that
the
north
could
occupy
an
important
city
in
the
heart
of
georgia
then
they
recalled
farragut
victory
of
a
month
before
then
there
followed
close
to
washington
putting
an
end
to
a
continual
menace
stirring
and
picturesquely
brilliant
beyond
other
incidents
of
the
war
sheridan
repeated
victories
in
the
shenandoah
valley
the
war
which
had
been
voted
a
failure
was
evidently
not
a
failure
at
the
same
time
men
of
high
character
conducted
a
vigorous
campaign
of
speeches
for
lincoln
general
schurz
the
german
revolutionary
liberal
who
lived
to
tell
bismarck
at
his
table
that
he
still
preferred
democracy
to
his
amused
host
method
of
government
sacrificed
his
command
in
the
army
for
lincoln
told
him
it
could
not
be
restored
to
speak
for
lincoln
even
chase
was
carried
away
and
after
months
of
insidious
detraction
went
for
lincoln
on
the
stump
in
the
elections
in
november
lincoln
was
elected
by
an
enormous
popular
majority
giving
him
out
of
the
votes
in
the
electoral
college
where
in
form
the
election
is
made
three
northern
states
only
one
of
them
his
native
state
had
gone
against
him
he
made
some
little
speeches
to
parties
which
came
to
serenade
him
some
were
not
very
formal
speeches
for
as
he
said
he
was
now
too
old
to
care
much
about
the
mode
of
doing
things
but
one
was
this
it
has
long
been
a
grave
question
whether
any
government
not
too
strong
for
the
liberties
of
its
people
can
be
strong
enough
to
maintain
its
existence
in
great
emergencies
on
this
point
the
present
rebellion
brought
our
government
to
a
severe
test
and
a
presidential
election
occurring
in
regular
course
during
the
rebellion
added
not
a
little
to
the
strain
but
we
can
not
have
a
free
government
without
elections
and
if
the
rebellion
could
force
us
to
forego
or
postpone
a
national
election
it
might
fairly
claim
to
have
already
conquered
and
ruined
us
but
the
election
along
with
its
incidental
and
undesirable
strife
has
done
good
too
it
has
demonstrated
that
a
people
government
can
sustain
a
national
election
in
the
midst
of
a
great
civil
war
until
now
it
has
not
been
known
to
the
world
that
this
was
a
possibility
but
the
rebellion
continues
and
now
that
the
election
is
over
may
not
all
have
a
common
interest
to
reunite
in
a
common
effort
to
save
our
common
country
for
my
own
part
i
have
striven
and
shall
strive
to
avoid
placing
any
obstacle
in
the
way
so
long
as
i
have
been
here
i
have
not
willingly
planted
a
thorn
in
any
man
bosom
while
i
am
duly
sensible
to
the
high
compliment
of
a
and
duly
grateful
as
i
trust
to
almighty
god
for
having
directed
my
countrymen
to
a
right
conclusion
as
i
think
for
their
good
it
adds
nothing
to
my
satisfaction
that
any
man
may
be
disappointed
by
the
result
may
i
ask
those
who
have
not
differed
from
me
to
join
with
me
in
this
same
spirit
towards
those
who
have
and
now
let
me
close
by
asking
three
hearty
cheers
for
our
brave
soldiers
and
seamen
and
their
gallant
and
skilful
commanders
in
the
cabinet
he
brought
out
the
paper
that
he
had
sealed
up
in
the
dark
days
of
august
he
reminded
his
ministers
of
how
they
had
endorsed
it
unread
and
he
read
it
them
its
contents
ran
thus
this
morning
as
for
some
days
past
it
seems
exceedingly
probable
that
this
administration
will
not
be
then
it
will
be
my
duty
to
so
with
the
as
to
save
the
union
between
the
election
and
the
inauguration
as
he
will
have
secured
his
election
on
such
ground
that
he
can
not
possibly
save
it
afterwards
lincoln
explained
what
he
had
intended
to
do
if
mcclellan
had
won
he
would
have
gone
to
him
and
said
general
this
election
shows
that
you
are
stronger
have
more
influence
with
the
people
of
this
country
than
i
and
he
would
have
invited
him
to
in
saving
the
union
now
by
using
that
great
influence
to
secure
from
the
people
the
willing
enlistment
of
enough
recruits
and
the
general
said
seward
would
have
said
yes
and
again
the
next
day
when
you
spoke
to
him
about
it
yes
and
so
on
indefinitely
and
he
would
have
done
nothing
seldom
in
history
wrote
emerson
in
a
letter
after
the
election
was
so
much
staked
upon
a
popular
vote
i
suppose
never
in
history
and
to
those
americans
of
all
classes
and
in
all
districts
of
the
north
who
had
set
their
hearts
and
were
giving
all
they
had
to
give
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
nation
the
political
crisis
of
would
seem
to
have
been
the
most
anxious
moment
of
the
war
it
is
impossible
it
must
be
repeated
to
guess
how
great
the
danger
really
was
that
their
popular
government
might
in
the
result
betray
the
true
and
underlying
will
of
the
people
for
in
any
country
and
in
america
perhaps
more
than
most
the
average
of
politicians
whose
voices
are
most
loudly
heard
can
only
in
a
rough
and
approximate
fashion
be
representative
but
there
is
in
any
case
no
cause
for
surprise
that
the
north
should
at
one
time
have
trembled
historic
imagination
is
easily
though
not
one
whit
too
deeply
moved
by
the
heroic
stand
of
the
south
it
is
only
after
the
effort
to
understand
the
light
in
which
the
task
of
the
north
has
presented
itself
to
capable
soldiers
that
a
civilian
can
perceive
what
sustained
resolution
was
required
if
though
far
the
stronger
it
was
to
make
its
strength
tell
notwithstanding
the
somewhat
painful
impression
which
the
political
chronicle
of
this
time
at
some
points
gives
it
is
the
fact
that
the
wisest
englishmen
who
were
in
those
days
in
america
and
had
means
of
observing
what
passed
have
retained
a
lasting
sense
of
the
constancy
under
trial
of
the
north
chapter
xii
the
end
on
december
lincoln
sent
the
last
of
his
annual
messages
to
congress
he
treated
as
matter
for
oblivion
the
impugning
of
motives
and
heated
controversy
as
to
the
proper
means
of
advancing
the
union
cause
which
had
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
presidential
election
and
the
other
elections
of
the
autumn
for
as
he
said
on
the
distinct
issue
of
union
or
no
union
the
politicians
have
shown
their
instinctive
knowledge
that
there
is
no
diversity
among
the
people
this
was
accurate
as
well
as
generous
for
though
many
democrats
had
opposed
the
war
none
had
avowed
that
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
would
give
up
the
union
passing
then
to
the
means
by
which
the
union
could
be
made
to
prevail
he
wrote
on
careful
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
accessible
it
seems
to
me
that
no
attempt
at
negotiation
with
the
insurgent
leader
could
result
in
any
good
he
would
accept
nothing
short
of
severance
of
the
union
precisely
what
we
will
not
and
can
not
give
between
him
and
us
the
issue
is
distinct
simple
and
inflexible
it
is
an
issue
which
can
only
be
tried
by
war
and
decided
by
victory
the
abandonment
of
armed
resistance
to
the
national
authority
on
the
part
of
the
insurgents
is
the
only
indispensable
condition
to
ending
the
war
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
avoid
a
possible
misunderstanding
he
added
that
not
a
single
person
who
was
free
by
the
terms
of
the
emancipation
proclamation
or
of
any
act
of
congress
would
be
returned
to
slavery
while
he
held
the
executive
authority
if
the
people
should
by
whatever
mode
or
means
make
it
an
executive
duty
to
such
persons
another
and
not
i
must
be
their
instrument
to
perform
it
this
last
sentence
was
no
meaningless
flourish
the
constitutional
amendment
prohibiting
slavery
could
not
be
passed
for
some
time
and
might
conceivably
be
defeated
in
the
meantime
the
courts
might
possibly
have
declared
any
negro
in
the
southern
states
a
slave
lincoln
words
let
it
be
seen
that
they
would
have
found
themselves
without
an
arm
to
enforce
their
decision
but
in
fact
there
was
no
longer
an
issue
with
the
south
as
to
abolition
jefferson
davis
had
himself
declared
that
slavery
was
gone
for
most
slaves
had
now
freed
themselves
and
that
he
for
his
part
troubled
very
little
over
that
there
remained
then
no
issue
between
north
and
south
except
that
between
independence
and
union
on
the
same
day
that
he
sent
his
annual
message
lincoln
gave
himself
a
characteristic
pleasure
by
another
communication
which
he
sent
to
the
senate
old
roger
taney
of
the
dred
scott
case
had
died
in
october
the
senate
was
now
requested
to
confirm
the
president
nomination
of
a
new
chief
justice
to
succeed
him
and
the
president
had
nominated
chase
chase
reputation
as
a
lawyer
had
seemed
to
fit
him
for
the
position
but
the
well
informed
declared
that
in
spite
of
some
appearances
on
the
platform
for
lincoln
he
still
kept
going
around
peddling
his
griefs
in
private
ears
and
sowing
dissatisfaction
against
lincoln
so
in
spite
of
lincoln
pregnant
remark
on
this
subject
that
he
did
not
believe
in
keeping
any
man
under
nobody
supposed
that
lincoln
would
appoint
him
sumner
and
congressman
alley
of
massachusetts
had
indeed
gone
to
lincoln
to
urge
the
appointment
we
found
to
our
dismay
alley
relates
that
the
president
had
heard
of
the
bitter
criticisms
of
chase
upon
himself
and
his
administration
lincoln
urged
many
of
chase
defects
to
discover
as
we
afterwards
learned
how
his
objection
could
be
answered
we
were
both
discouraged
and
made
up
our
minds
that
the
president
did
not
mean
to
appoint
chase
it
really
seemed
too
much
to
expect
of
poor
human
nature
one
morning
alley
again
saw
the
president
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
will
make
you
happy
said
lincoln
i
have
just
sent
chase
word
that
he
is
to
be
appointed
chief
justice
and
you
are
the
first
man
i
have
told
of
it
alley
said
something
natural
about
lincoln
magnanimity
but
was
told
in
reply
what
the
only
real
difficulty
had
been
lincoln
from
his
convictions
of
duty
to
the
republican
party
and
the
country
had
always
meant
to
appoint
chase
subject
to
one
doubt
which
he
had
revolved
in
his
mind
till
he
had
settled
it
this
doubt
was
simply
whether
chase
beset
as
he
was
by
a
craving
for
the
presidency
which
he
could
never
obtain
would
ever
really
turn
his
attention
with
a
will
to
becoming
the
great
chief
justice
that
lincoln
thought
he
could
be
lincoln
occasional
failures
of
tact
had
sometimes
a
noble
side
to
them
he
even
thought
now
of
writing
to
chase
and
telling
him
with
simple
seriousness
where
he
felt
his
temptation
lay
and
he
with
difficulty
came
to
see
that
this
attempt
at
brotherly
frankness
would
be
misconstrued
by
a
suspicious
and
jealous
man
charles
sumner
chase
advocate
on
this
occasion
was
all
this
time
the
most
weighty
and
the
most
pronounced
of
those
radicals
who
were
beginning
to
press
for
unrestricted
negro
suffrage
in
the
south
and
in
general
for
a
hard
and
inelastic
scheme
of
reconstruction
which
they
would
have
imposed
on
the
conquered
south
without
an
attempt
to
conciliate
the
feeling
of
the
vanquished
or
to
invite
their
in
building
up
the
new
order
he
was
thus
the
chief
opponent
of
that
more
tentative
but
as
is
now
seen
more
liberal
and
more
practical
policy
which
lay
very
close
to
heart
enough
has
been
said
of
him
to
suggest
too
that
this
grave
person
bereft
of
any
glimmering
of
fun
was
in
one
sense
no
congenial
companion
for
lincoln
but
he
was
stainlessly
unselfish
and
sincere
and
he
was
the
politician
above
all
others
in
washington
with
whom
lincoln
most
gladly
and
most
successfully
maintained
easy
social
intercourse
and
to
please
him
in
little
ways
lincoln
would
disentangle
his
long
frame
from
the
grotesque
position
of
comfort
into
which
he
had
twisted
it
in
talk
with
some
other
friend
and
would
assume
in
an
instant
a
courtly
demeanour
when
sumner
was
about
to
enter
his
room
on
january
the
resolution
earlier
passed
by
the
senate
for
a
constitutional
amendment
to
prohibit
slavery
was
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
as
lincoln
had
eagerly
desired
so
that
the
requisite
voting
of
three
quarters
of
the
states
in
its
favour
could
now
begin
before
that
time
the
confederate
congress
had
on
march
closed
its
last
most
anxious
and
distracted
session
by
passing
an
act
for
the
enlistment
of
negro
volunteers
who
were
to
become
free
on
enlistment
as
a
military
measure
it
was
belated
and
inoperative
but
nothing
could
more
eloquently
have
marked
the
practical
extinction
of
slavery
which
the
war
had
wrought
than
the
consent
of
southern
legislators
to
convert
the
remaining
slaves
into
soldiers
the
military
operations
of
had
proceeded
but
a
very
little
way
when
the
sense
of
what
they
portended
was
felt
among
the
southern
leaders
in
richmond
the
fall
of
that
capital
itself
might
be
hastened
or
be
delayed
lee
army
if
it
escaped
from
richmond
might
prolong
resistance
for
a
shorter
or
for
a
longer
time
but
sherman
march
to
the
sea
and
the
far
harder
achievements
of
the
same
kind
which
he
was
now
beginning
made
the
south
feel
as
he
knew
it
would
feel
that
not
a
port
not
an
arsenal
not
a
railway
not
a
corn
district
of
the
south
lay
any
longer
beyond
the
striking
range
of
the
north
congressmen
and
public
officials
in
richmond
knew
that
the
people
of
the
south
now
longed
for
peace
and
that
the
authority
of
the
confederacy
was
gone
they
beset
jefferson
davis
with
demands
that
he
should
start
negotiations
but
none
of
them
had
determined
what
price
they
would
pay
for
peace
and
there
was
not
among
them
any
will
that
could
really
withstand
their
president
in
one
point
indeed
jefferson
davis
did
wisely
yield
on
february
he
consented
to
make
lee
of
all
the
southern
armies
this
belated
delegation
of
larger
authority
to
lee
had
certain
military
results
but
no
political
result
whatever
lee
could
have
been
the
dictator
of
the
confederacy
if
he
had
chosen
and
no
one
then
or
since
would
have
blamed
him
but
it
was
not
in
his
mind
to
do
anything
but
his
duty
as
a
soldier
the
best
beloved
and
most
memorable
by
far
of
all
the
men
who
served
that
lost
cause
he
had
done
nothing
to
bring
about
secession
at
the
beginning
nor
now
did
he
do
anything
but
conform
to
the
wishes
of
his
political
chief
as
for
that
chief
lincoln
had
interpreted
simple
position
quite
rightly
having
once
embraced
the
cause
of
southern
independence
and
taken
the
oath
as
chief
magistrate
of
an
independent
confederacy
he
would
not
yield
up
that
cause
while
there
was
a
man
to
obey
his
orders
whether
this
attitude
should
be
set
down
as
it
usually
has
been
set
down
to
a
diseased
pride
or
to
a
very
real
heroism
on
his
part
he
never
faced
the
truth
that
the
situation
was
desperate
and
the
spirit
of
his
people
daunted
at
last
but
it
is
probable
that
just
like
lincoln
he
was
ready
that
those
who
were
in
haste
to
make
peace
should
see
what
peace
involved
and
it
is
probable
too
that
in
his
terrible
position
he
deluded
himself
with
some
vague
and
vain
hopes
as
to
the
attitude
of
the
north
lincoln
on
the
other
hand
would
not
enter
into
any
proceedings
in
which
the
secession
of
the
south
was
treated
otherwise
than
as
a
rebellion
which
must
cease
but
this
did
not
absolutely
compel
him
to
refuse
every
sort
of
informal
communication
with
influential
men
in
the
south
which
might
help
them
to
see
where
they
stood
and
from
which
he
too
might
learn
something
old
francis
blair
the
father
of
lincoln
late
was
the
last
of
the
honest
whom
lincoln
had
allowed
to
see
things
for
themselves
by
meeting
jefferson
davis
his
visit
took
place
in
january
and
from
his
determination
to
be
a
and
the
curious
and
difficult
position
in
which
lincoln
and
davis
both
stood
in
this
respect
an
odd
result
arose
the
confederate
stephens
who
had
preached
peace
in
the
autumn
without
a
quarrel
with
davis
and
two
other
southern
leaders
presented
themselves
at
headquarters
with
the
pathetic
misrepresentation
that
they
were
sent
by
davis
on
a
mission
which
lincoln
had
undertaken
to
receive
what
they
could
show
was
authority
from
davis
to
negotiate
with
lincoln
on
the
footing
of
the
independence
of
the
confederacy
and
a
politely
turned
intimation
from
lincoln
that
he
would
at
any
time
receive
persons
informally
sent
to
talk
with
a
view
to
the
surrender
of
the
rebel
armies
grant
however
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
sincerity
of
their
desire
for
peace
and
he
entreated
lincoln
to
receive
them
lincoln
therefore
decided
to
overlook
the
false
pretence
under
which
they
came
he
gave
grant
strict
orders
not
to
delay
his
operations
on
this
account
but
he
came
himself
with
seward
and
met
davis
three
commissioners
on
a
ship
at
hampton
roads
on
february
he
and
stephens
had
in
old
days
been
whig
congressmen
together
and
lincoln
had
once
been
moved
to
tears
by
a
speech
of
stephens
they
met
now
as
friends
lincoln
lost
no
time
in
making
his
position
clear
the
unhappy
commissioners
made
every
effort
to
lead
him
away
from
the
plain
ground
he
had
chosen
it
is
evident
that
they
and
possible
that
jefferson
davis
had
hoped
that
when
face
to
face
with
them
he
would
change
his
mind
and
possibly
blair
talk
had
served
to
encourage
this
hope
they
failed
but
the
conversation
continued
in
a
frank
and
friendly
manner
lincoln
told
them
very
freely
his
personal
opinions
as
to
how
the
north
ought
to
treat
the
south
when
it
did
surrender
but
was
careful
to
point
out
that
he
could
make
no
promise
or
bargain
except
indeed
this
promise
that
so
far
as
penalties
for
rebellion
were
concerned
the
executive
power
which
lay
in
his
sole
hands
would
be
liberally
used
slavery
was
discussed
and
seward
told
them
of
the
constitutional
amendment
which
congress
had
now
submitted
to
the
people
one
of
the
commissioners
returning
again
to
lincoln
refusal
to
negotiate
with
armed
rebels
as
he
considered
them
cited
the
precedent
of
charles
i
conduct
in
this
respect
i
do
not
profess
said
lincoln
to
be
posted
in
history
on
all
such
matters
i
turn
you
over
to
seward
all
i
distinctly
recollect
about
charles
is
that
he
lost
his
head
in
the
end
then
he
broke
out
into
simple
advice
to
stephens
as
to
the
action
he
could
now
pursue
he
had
to
report
to
congress
afterwards
that
the
conference
had
had
no
result
he
brought
home
however
a
personal
compliment
which
he
valued
i
understand
then
stephens
had
said
that
you
regard
us
as
rebels
who
are
liable
to
be
hanged
for
treason
that
is
so
said
lincoln
well
said
stephens
we
supposed
that
would
have
to
be
your
view
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
have
none
of
us
been
much
afraid
of
being
hanged
with
you
as
president
he
brought
home
besides
the
compliment
an
idea
of
a
kind
which
if
he
could
have
had
his
way
with
his
friends
might
have
been
rich
in
good
he
had
discovered
how
hopeless
the
people
of
the
south
were
and
he
considered
whether
a
friendly
pronouncement
might
not
lead
them
more
readily
to
surrender
he
deplored
the
suffering
in
which
the
south
might
now
lie
plunged
and
it
was
a
fixed
part
of
his
creed
that
slavery
was
the
sin
not
of
the
south
but
of
the
nation
so
he
spent
the
day
after
his
return
in
drafting
a
joint
resolution
which
he
hoped
the
two
houses
of
congress
might
pass
and
a
proclamation
which
he
would
in
that
case
issue
in
these
he
proposed
to
offer
to
the
southern
states
four
hundred
million
dollars
in
united
states
bonds
being
as
he
calculated
the
cost
to
the
north
of
two
hundred
days
of
war
to
be
allotted
among
those
states
in
proportion
to
the
property
in
slaves
which
each
had
lost
one
half
of
this
sum
was
to
be
paid
at
once
if
the
war
ended
by
april
and
the
other
half
upon
the
final
adoption
of
the
constitutional
amendment
it
would
have
been
a
happy
thing
if
the
work
of
restoring
peace
could
have
lain
with
a
statesman
whose
rare
aberrations
from
the
path
of
practical
politics
were
of
this
kind
yet
considering
the
natural
passions
which
even
in
this
least
revengeful
of
civil
wars
could
not
quite
be
repressed
we
should
be
judging
the
congress
of
that
day
by
a
higher
standard
than
we
should
apply
in
other
countries
if
we
regarded
this
proposal
as
one
that
could
have
been
hopefully
submitted
to
them
lincoln
illusions
were
dispelled
on
the
following
day
when
he
read
what
he
had
written
to
his
cabinet
and
found
that
even
among
his
own
ministers
not
one
man
supported
him
it
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
to
put
forward
his
proposals
and
to
fail
you
are
all
opposed
to
me
he
said
sadly
and
he
put
his
papers
away
but
the
war
had
now
so
far
progressed
that
it
is
necessary
to
turn
back
to
the
point
at
which
we
left
it
at
the
end
of
winter
weather
brought
a
brief
pause
to
the
operations
of
the
armies
sherman
at
savannah
was
preparing
to
begin
his
northward
march
a
harder
matter
owing
to
the
rivers
and
marshes
that
lay
in
his
way
than
his
triumphal
progress
from
atlanta
efforts
were
made
to
concentrate
all
available
forces
against
him
at
augusta
to
his
making
feints
against
augusta
on
the
one
side
and
against
the
city
and
port
of
charleston
on
the
other
he
displayed
the
marvellous
engineering
capacity
of
his
army
by
an
advance
of
speed
across
the
marshes
to
columbia
due
north
of
him
which
is
the
state
capital
of
south
carolina
he
reached
it
on
february
the
intended
concentration
of
the
south
at
augusta
was
broken
up
the
retreating
confederates
set
fire
to
great
stores
of
cotton
and
the
unfortunate
city
was
burnt
a
calamity
for
which
the
south
by
a
natural
but
most
unjust
mistake
blamed
sherman
the
railway
communications
of
charleston
were
now
certain
to
be
severed
so
the
confederates
were
forced
to
evacuate
it
and
on
february
the
north
occupied
the
chief
home
of
the
misbegotten
political
ideals
of
the
south
and
of
its
real
culture
and
chivalry
admiral
porter
for
age
and
had
come
upon
farragut
was
ready
at
sea
to
with
sherman
thomas
army
in
tennessee
had
not
been
allowed
by
grant
to
go
into
winter
quarters
a
part
of
it
under
schofield
was
brought
to
washington
and
there
shipped
for
north
carolina
where
ever
since
burnside
successful
expedition
in
the
union
government
had
held
the
ports
north
of
wilmington
wilmington
itself
was
the
only
port
left
to
the
south
and
richmond
had
now
come
to
depend
largely
on
the
precarious
and
costly
supplies
which
could
still
notwithstanding
the
blockade
be
run
into
that
harbour
at
the
end
of
december
butler
acting
in
flagrant
disobedience
to
grant
had
achieved
his
crowning
failure
in
a
joint
expedition
with
porter
against
wilmington
but
porter
was
not
discouraged
nor
was
grant
who
from
beginning
to
end
of
his
career
had
worked
well
together
with
the
navy
on
february
porter
this
time
supported
by
an
energetic
general
terry
effected
a
brilliant
capture
of
fort
fisher
at
the
mouth
of
wilmington
harbour
the
port
was
closed
to
the
south
on
the
the
city
itself
fell
to
schofield
and
sherman
had
now
this
sea
base
at
hand
if
he
needed
it
meanwhile
grant
entrenchments
on
the
east
of
richmond
and
petersburg
were
still
extending
southward
and
lee
defences
had
been
stretched
till
they
covered
nearly
forty
miles
grant
lines
now
cut
the
principal
railway
southward
from
the
huge
fortress
and
he
was
able
effectually
to
interrupt
communication
by
road
to
the
southwest
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
richmond
would
fall
soon
and
the
real
question
was
coming
to
be
whether
lee
and
his
army
could
escape
from
richmond
and
still
carry
on
the
war
the
appointment
of
lee
as
was
not
too
late
to
bear
one
consequence
which
may
have
prolonged
the
war
a
little
joseph
johnston
whose
ability
in
a
campaign
of
constant
retirement
before
overwhelming
force
had
been
respected
and
redoubted
by
sherman
had
been
discarded
by
davis
in
the
previous
july
he
was
now
put
in
command
of
the
forces
which
it
was
hoped
to
concentrate
against
sherman
with
a
view
to
holding
up
his
northward
advance
and
preventing
him
from
joining
hands
with
grant
before
richmond
there
were
altogether
about
confederate
troops
scattered
in
the
carolinas
georgia
and
florida
and
there
would
be
about
the
same
number
under
sherman
when
schofield
in
north
carolina
could
join
him
but
the
number
which
johnston
could
now
collect
together
seems
never
to
have
exceeded
it
was
sherman
task
by
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
to
prevent
a
very
formidable
concentration
against
him
johnston
on
the
other
hand
must
hinder
if
he
could
sherman
junction
with
schofield
just
before
that
junction
took
place
he
narrowly
missed
dealing
a
considerable
blow
to
sherman
army
at
the
battle
of
bentonville
in
the
heart
of
north
carolina
but
had
in
the
end
to
withdraw
within
an
entrenched
position
where
sherman
would
not
attack
him
but
which
upon
the
arrival
of
schofield
he
was
forced
to
abandon
on
march
sherman
took
possession
of
the
town
and
railway
junction
of
goldsborough
between
raleigh
and
new
berne
from
savannah
to
goldsborough
he
had
led
his
army
miles
in
fifty
days
amid
disadvantages
of
ground
and
of
weather
which
had
called
forth
both
extraordinary
endurance
and
mechanical
skill
on
the
part
of
his
men
he
lay
now
miles
south
of
petersburg
by
the
railway
the
port
of
new
berne
to
the
east
of
him
on
the
estuary
of
the
neuse
gave
him
a
sure
base
of
supplies
and
would
enable
him
quickly
to
move
his
army
by
sea
to
petersburg
and
richmond
if
grant
should
so
decide
the
direction
in
which
johnston
would
now
fall
back
lay
inland
up
the
neuse
valley
also
along
a
railway
towards
greensborough
some
miles
of
petersburg
greensborough
was
connected
by
another
railway
with
petersburg
and
richmond
and
along
this
line
lee
might
attempt
to
retire
and
join
him
all
this
time
whatever
designs
lee
had
of
leaving
richmond
were
suspended
because
the
roads
in
that
weather
were
too
bad
for
his
transport
and
while
of
necessity
he
waited
his
possible
openings
narrowed
philip
sheridan
had
now
received
the
coveted
rank
of
which
mcclellan
had
resigned
on
the
day
on
which
he
was
defeated
for
the
presidency
the
north
delighted
to
find
in
his
achievements
the
dashing
quality
which
appeals
to
civilian
imagination
and
grant
now
had
in
him
as
well
as
in
sherman
a
lieutenant
who
would
faithfully
make
his
chief
purposes
his
own
and
who
would
execute
them
with
independent
decision
the
cold
in
which
his
horses
suffered
had
driven
sheridan
into
winter
quarters
but
on
february
he
was
able
to
start
up
the
shenandoah
valley
again
with
cavalry
most
of
the
confederate
cavalry
under
early
had
now
been
dispersed
mainly
for
want
of
forage
in
the
desolated
valley
the
rest
were
now
dispersed
by
sheridan
and
the
greater
part
of
early
small
force
of
infantry
with
all
his
artillery
were
captured
there
was
a
garrison
in
lynchburg
or
miles
west
of
richmond
which
though
strong
enough
to
prevent
sheridan
cavalry
from
capturing
that
place
was
not
otherwise
of
account
but
there
was
no
confederate
force
in
the
field
except
johnston
men
near
enough
to
with
lee
only
some
small
and
distant
armies
hundreds
of
miles
away
with
the
railway
communication
between
them
and
the
east
destroyed
sheridan
now
broke
up
the
railway
and
canal
communication
on
the
side
of
richmond
he
was
to
have
gone
on
south
and
eventually
joined
sherman
if
he
could
but
finding
himself
stopped
for
the
time
by
floods
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
james
he
rode
past
the
north
of
richmond
and
on
march
joined
grant
to
put
his
cavalry
and
brains
at
his
service
when
grant
judged
that
the
moment
for
his
final
effort
had
come
on
march
abraham
lincoln
took
office
for
the
second
time
as
president
of
the
united
states
there
was
one
new
and
striking
feature
in
the
simple
ceremonial
the
presence
of
a
battalion
of
negro
troops
in
his
escort
this
time
though
he
would
say
no
sanguine
word
it
can
not
have
been
a
long
continuance
of
war
that
filled
his
thoughts
but
the
scarcely
less
difficult
though
far
happier
task
of
restoring
the
fabric
of
peaceful
society
in
the
conquered
south
his
difficulties
were
now
likely
to
come
from
the
north
no
less
than
the
south
tentative
proposals
which
he
had
once
or
twice
made
suggest
the
spirit
in
which
he
would
have
felt
his
way
along
this
new
path
in
the
inaugural
address
which
he
now
delivered
that
spirit
is
none
the
less
perceptible
because
he
spoke
of
the
past
the
little
speech
at
gettysburg
with
its
singular
perfection
of
form
and
the
second
inaugural
are
the
chief
outstanding
examples
of
his
peculiar
oratorical
power
the
comparative
rank
of
his
oratory
need
not
be
discussed
for
at
any
rate
it
was
individual
and
unlike
that
of
most
other
great
speakers
in
history
though
perhaps
more
like
that
of
some
great
speeches
in
drama
but
there
is
a
point
of
some
moment
in
which
the
second
inaugural
does
invite
a
comment
and
a
comment
which
should
be
quite
explicit
probably
no
other
speech
of
a
modern
statesman
uses
so
unreservedly
the
language
of
intense
religious
feeling
the
occasion
made
it
natural
neither
the
thought
nor
the
words
are
in
any
way
conventional
no
sensible
reader
now
could
entertain
a
suspicion
that
the
orator
spoke
to
the
heart
of
the
people
but
did
not
speak
from
his
own
heart
but
an
old
illinois
attorney
who
thought
he
knew
the
real
lincoln
behind
the
president
might
have
wondered
whether
the
real
lincoln
spoke
here
for
lincoln
religion
like
everything
else
in
his
character
became
when
he
was
famous
a
stock
subject
of
discussion
among
his
old
associates
many
said
he
was
a
christian
but
did
not
know
it
some
hinted
with
an
air
of
great
sagacity
that
so
far
from
his
being
a
christian
or
a
religious
man
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
in
early
manhood
he
broke
away
for
ever
from
the
scheme
of
christian
theology
which
was
probably
more
or
less
common
to
the
very
various
churches
which
surrounded
him
he
had
avowed
this
sweeping
denial
with
a
freedom
which
pained
some
friends
perhaps
rather
by
its
rashness
than
by
its
impiety
and
he
was
apt
to
regard
the
procedure
of
theologians
as
a
blasphemous
twisting
of
the
words
of
christ
he
rejected
that
belief
in
miracles
and
in
the
literally
inspired
accuracy
of
the
bible
narrative
which
was
no
doubt
held
as
fundamental
by
all
these
churches
he
rejected
no
less
any
attempt
to
substitute
for
this
foundation
the
belief
in
any
priestly
authority
or
in
the
authority
of
any
formal
and
earthly
society
called
the
church
with
this
total
independence
of
the
expressed
creeds
of
his
neighbours
he
still
went
and
took
his
boys
to
presbyterian
public
worship
their
mother
was
an
episcopalian
and
his
own
parents
had
been
baptists
he
loved
the
bible
and
knew
it
intimately
he
is
said
also
by
the
way
to
have
stored
in
his
memory
a
large
number
of
hymns
in
the
year
before
his
death
he
wrote
to
speed
i
am
profitably
engaged
in
reading
the
bible
take
all
of
this
book
upon
reason
that
you
can
and
the
balance
upon
faith
and
you
will
live
and
die
a
better
man
it
was
not
so
much
the
old
testament
as
the
new
testament
and
what
he
called
the
true
spirit
of
christ
that
he
loved
especially
and
took
with
all
possible
seriousness
as
the
rule
of
life
his
theology
in
the
narrower
sense
may
be
said
to
have
been
limited
to
an
intense
belief
in
a
vast
and
providence
the
lighter
forms
of
superstitious
feelings
which
he
is
known
to
have
had
in
common
with
most
frontiersmen
were
apparently
of
no
importance
in
his
life
and
this
providence
darkly
spoken
of
was
certainly
conceived
by
him
as
intimately
and
kindly
related
to
his
own
life
in
his
presidential
candidature
when
he
owned
to
some
one
that
the
opposition
of
clergymen
hurt
him
deeply
he
is
said
to
have
confessed
to
being
no
christian
and
to
have
continued
i
know
that
there
is
a
god
and
that
he
hates
injustice
and
slavery
i
see
the
storm
coming
and
i
know
that
his
hand
is
in
it
if
he
has
a
place
and
work
for
me
and
i
think
he
has
i
believe
i
am
ready
i
am
nothing
but
truth
is
everything
i
know
i
am
right
because
i
know
that
liberty
is
right
for
christ
teaches
it
and
christ
is
god
i
have
told
them
that
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
and
christ
and
reason
say
the
same
and
they
will
find
it
so
when
old
acquaintances
said
that
he
had
no
religion
they
based
their
opinion
on
such
remarks
as
that
the
god
of
whom
he
had
just
been
speaking
solemnly
was
not
a
person
it
would
be
unprofitable
to
enquire
what
he
and
many
others
meant
by
this
expression
but
later
at
any
rate
this
impersonal
power
was
one
with
which
he
could
hold
commune
his
robust
intellect
impatient
of
unproved
assertion
was
unlikely
to
rest
in
the
common
assumption
that
things
dimly
seen
may
be
treated
as
not
being
there
so
humorous
a
man
was
also
unlikely
to
be
too
conceited
to
say
his
prayers
at
any
rate
he
said
them
said
them
intently
valued
the
fact
that
others
prayed
for
him
and
for
the
nation
and
as
in
official
proclamations
concerning
days
of
national
religious
observance
he
could
wield
like
no
other
modern
writer
the
language
of
the
prayer
book
so
he
would
speak
of
prayer
without
the
smallest
embarrassment
in
talk
with
a
general
or
a
statesman
it
is
possible
that
this
was
a
development
of
later
years
lincoln
did
not
like
most
of
us
arrest
his
growth
to
lincoln
it
seemed
that
with
the
death
of
their
child
willie
a
change
came
over
his
whole
religious
outlook
it
well
might
and
since
that
grief
which
came
while
his
troubles
were
beginning
much
else
had
come
to
lincoln
and
now
through
four
years
of
unsurpassed
trial
his
capacity
had
steadily
grown
and
his
delicate
fairness
his
pitifulness
his
patience
his
modesty
had
grown
therewith
here
is
one
of
the
few
speeches
ever
delivered
by
a
great
man
at
the
crisis
of
his
fate
on
the
sort
of
occasion
which
a
tragedian
telling
his
story
would
have
devised
for
him
this
man
had
stood
alone
in
the
dark
he
had
done
justice
he
had
loved
mercy
he
had
walked
humbly
with
his
god
the
reader
to
whom
religious
utterance
makes
little
appeal
will
not
suppose
that
his
imaginative
words
stand
for
no
real
experience
the
reader
whose
piety
knows
no
questions
will
not
be
pained
to
think
that
this
man
had
professed
no
faith
he
said
fellow
countrymen
at
this
second
appearance
to
take
the
oath
of
the
presidential
office
there
is
less
occasion
for
an
extended
address
than
there
was
at
the
first
then
a
statement
somewhat
in
detail
of
a
course
to
be
pursued
seemed
fitting
and
proper
now
at
the
expiration
of
four
years
during
which
public
declarations
have
been
constantly
called
forth
on
every
point
and
phase
of
the
great
contest
which
still
absorbs
the
energies
and
engrosses
the
attention
of
the
nation
little
that
is
new
could
be
presented
the
progress
of
our
arms
upon
which
all
else
chiefly
depends
is
as
well
known
to
the
public
as
to
myself
and
it
is
i
trust
reasonably
satisfactory
and
encouraging
to
all
with
high
hope
for
the
future
no
prediction
in
regard
to
it
is
ventured
on
the
occasion
corresponding
to
this
four
years
ago
all
thoughts
were
anxiously
directed
to
an
impending
civil
war
all
dreaded
it
all
sought
to
avert
it
while
the
inaugural
address
was
being
delivered
from
this
place
devoted
altogether
to
saving
the
union
without
war
insurgent
agents
were
in
the
city
seeking
to
destroy
it
without
war
seeking
to
dissolve
the
union
and
divide
effects
by
negotiation
both
parties
deprecated
war
but
one
of
them
would
make
war
rather
than
let
the
nation
survive
and
the
other
would
accept
war
rather
than
let
it
perish
and
the
war
came
of
the
whole
population
were
coloured
slaves
not
distributed
generally
over
the
union
but
localised
in
the
southern
part
of
it
these
slaves
constituted
a
peculiar
and
powerful
interest
all
knew
that
this
interest
was
somehow
the
cause
of
the
war
to
strengthen
perpetuate
and
extend
this
interest
was
the
object
for
which
the
insurgents
would
rend
the
union
even
by
war
while
the
government
claimed
no
right
to
do
more
than
to
restrict
the
territorial
enlargement
of
it
neither
party
expected
for
the
war
the
magnitude
or
the
duration
which
it
has
already
attained
neither
expected
that
the
cause
of
the
conflict
might
cease
with
or
even
before
the
conflict
itself
should
cease
each
looked
for
an
easier
triumph
and
a
result
less
fundamental
and
astounding
both
read
the
same
bible
and
pray
to
the
same
god
and
each
invokes
his
aid
against
the
other
it
may
seem
strange
that
any
men
should
dare
to
ask
a
just
god
assistance
in
wringing
their
bread
from
the
sweat
of
other
men
faces
but
let
us
judge
not
that
we
be
not
judged
the
prayers
of
both
could
not
be
answered
that
of
neither
has
been
answered
fully
the
almighty
has
his
own
purposes
unto
the
world
because
of
offenses
for
it
must
needs
be
that
offenses
come
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offense
cometh
if
we
shall
suppose
that
american
slavery
is
one
of
those
offenses
which
in
the
providence
of
god
must
needs
come
but
which
having
continued
through
his
appointed
time
he
now
wills
to
remove
and
that
he
gives
to
both
north
and
south
this
terrible
war
as
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
shall
we
discern
therein
any
departure
from
those
divine
attributes
which
the
believers
in
a
living
god
always
ascribe
to
him
fondly
do
we
hope
fervently
do
we
pray
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
speedily
pass
away
yet
if
god
wills
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
with
the
lash
shall
be
paid
with
another
drawn
with
the
sword
as
was
said
three
thousand
years
ago
so
still
it
must
be
said
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
his
orphan
to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and
with
all
nations
lincoln
own
commentary
may
follow
upon
his
speech
march
dear
weed
every
one
likes
a
little
compliment
thank
you
for
yours
on
my
little
notification
speech
and
on
the
recent
inaugural
address
i
expect
the
latter
to
wear
as
well
as
perhaps
better
than
anything
i
have
produced
but
i
believe
it
is
not
immediately
popular
men
are
not
flattered
by
being
shown
that
there
has
been
a
difference
of
purpose
between
the
almighty
and
them
to
deny
it
however
in
this
case
is
to
deny
that
there
is
a
god
governing
the
world
it
is
a
truth
which
i
thought
needed
to
be
told
and
as
whatever
of
humiliation
there
is
in
it
falls
most
directly
on
myself
i
thought
others
might
afford
for
me
to
tell
it
truly
yours
a
lincoln
on
march
a
period
of
bright
sunshine
seems
to
have
begun
in
lincoln
life
robert
lincoln
had
some
time
before
finished
his
course
at
harvard
and
his
father
had
written
to
grant
modestly
asking
him
if
he
could
suggest
the
way
accordant
with
discipline
and
good
example
in
which
the
young
man
could
best
see
something
of
military
life
grant
immediately
had
him
on
to
his
staff
with
a
commission
as
captain
and
now
grant
invited
lincoln
to
come
to
his
headquarters
for
a
holiday
visit
there
was
much
in
it
besides
holiday
for
grant
was
rapidly
maturing
his
plans
for
the
great
event
and
wanted
lincoln
near
moreover
sheridan
had
just
arrived
and
while
lincoln
was
there
sherman
came
from
goldsborough
with
admiral
porter
for
consultation
as
to
sherman
next
move
peremptory
as
he
was
in
any
necessary
political
instructions
lincoln
was
now
happy
to
say
nothing
of
military
matters
beyond
expressing
his
earnest
desire
that
the
final
overmastering
of
the
confederate
armies
should
be
accomplished
with
the
least
further
bloodshed
possible
and
indulging
the
curiosity
that
any
other
guest
might
have
shown
a
letter
home
to
lincoln
betrays
the
interest
with
which
he
heard
heavy
firing
quite
near
which
seemed
to
him
a
great
battle
but
did
not
excite
those
who
knew
then
there
were
rides
in
the
country
with
grant
staff
lincoln
in
his
tall
hat
and
frock
coat
was
a
marked
and
curious
figure
on
a
horse
he
had
once
by
the
way
insisted
on
riding
with
butler
catechising
him
with
remorseless
chaff
on
engineering
matters
and
forbidding
his
chief
engineer
to
prompt
him
along
six
miles
of
cheering
northern
troops
within
easy
sight
and
shot
of
the
confederate
soldiers
to
whom
his
hat
and
coat
identified
him
but
however
odd
a
figure
he
impressed
officers
as
a
good
and
bold
horseman
then
after
sherman
arrival
there
evidently
was
no
end
of
talk
sherman
was
at
first
amused
by
the
president
anxiety
as
to
whether
his
army
was
quite
safe
without
him
at
goldsborough
but
that
soldier
soon
received
as
he
has
said
an
impression
both
of
goodness
and
of
greatness
such
as
no
other
man
ever
gave
him
what
especially
remained
on
sherman
and
on
porter
mind
was
the
recollection
of
lincoln
desire
for
mercy
and
for
conciliation
with
the
conquered
indeed
sherman
blundered
later
in
the
terms
he
first
accepted
from
johnston
for
he
did
not
see
that
lincoln
clemency
for
southern
leaders
and
desire
for
the
welfare
of
the
south
included
no
mercy
at
all
for
the
political
principle
of
the
confederacy
grant
was
not
exposed
to
any
such
mistake
for
a
week
or
two
before
lee
had
made
overtures
to
him
for
some
sort
of
conference
and
lincoln
had
instantly
forbidden
him
to
confer
with
lee
for
any
purpose
but
that
of
his
unconditional
surrender
what
apart
from
the
reconstruction
of
southern
life
and
institutions
was
in
part
weighing
with
lincoln
was
the
question
of
punishments
for
rebellion
by
act
of
congress
the
holders
of
high
political
and
military
office
in
the
south
were
liable
as
traitors
and
there
was
now
talk
of
hanging
in
the
north
later
events
showed
that
a
very
different
sentiment
would
make
itself
heard
when
the
victory
came
but
lincoln
was
much
concerned
to
some
one
who
spoke
to
him
of
this
matter
he
exclaimed
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
ye
sons
of
zeruiah
that
ye
should
this
day
be
adversaries
unto
me
shall
there
any
man
be
put
to
death
this
day
in
israel
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
prerogative
of
mercy
would
have
been
vigorously
used
in
his
hands
but
he
did
not
wish
for
a
conflict
on
this
matter
at
all
and
grant
was
taught
in
a
parable
about
a
teetotal
irishman
who
forgave
being
served
with
liquor
unbeknownst
to
himself
that
zeal
in
capturing
jefferson
davis
and
his
colleagues
was
not
expected
of
him
while
lincoln
was
at
grant
headquarters
at
city
point
lee
hoping
to
recover
the
use
of
the
roads
to
the
endeavoured
to
cause
a
diversion
of
the
besiegers
strength
by
a
sortie
on
his
east
front
it
failed
and
gave
the
besiegers
a
further
point
of
vantage
on
april
sheridan
was
sent
far
round
the
south
of
lee
lines
and
in
a
battle
at
a
point
called
five
forks
established
himself
in
possession
of
the
railway
running
due
west
from
petersburg
the
defences
were
weakest
on
this
side
and
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
the
enemy
there
lee
was
bound
to
withdraw
troops
from
other
quarters
on
the
two
following
days
grant
army
delivered
assaults
at
several
points
on
the
east
side
of
the
petersburg
defences
penetrating
the
outer
lines
and
pushing
on
against
the
inner
fortifications
of
the
town
on
sunday
april
jefferson
davis
received
in
church
word
from
lee
to
make
instant
preparation
for
departure
as
petersburg
could
not
be
held
beyond
that
night
and
richmond
must
fall
immediately
that
night
the
confederate
government
left
the
capital
and
lee
evacuation
of
the
fortress
began
the
next
day
lincoln
was
sent
for
he
came
by
sea
and
to
the
astonishment
and
alarm
of
the
naval
officers
made
his
way
at
once
to
richmond
with
entirely
insufficient
escort
there
he
strolled
about
hand
in
hand
with
his
little
son
tad
greeted
by
exultant
negroes
and
stared
at
by
angry
or
curious
confederates
while
he
visited
the
former
prison
of
the
northern
prisoners
and
other
places
of
more
pleasant
attraction
without
receiving
any
annoyance
from
the
inhabitants
he
had
an
interesting
talk
with
campbell
formerly
a
supreme
court
judge
and
a
few
weeks
back
one
of
davis
commissioners
at
hampton
roads
campbell
obtained
permission
to
convene
a
meeting
of
the
members
of
the
virginia
legislature
with
a
view
to
speedier
surrender
by
lee
army
but
the
permission
was
revoked
for
he
somewhat
clumsily
mistook
its
terms
and
moreover
the
object
in
view
had
meantime
been
accomplished
jefferson
davis
was
then
making
his
way
with
his
ministers
to
johnston
army
when
they
arrived
he
and
they
held
council
with
johnston
and
beauregard
he
would
issue
a
proclamation
which
would
raise
him
many
soldiers
and
he
would
whip
them
yet
no
one
answered
him
at
last
he
asked
the
opinion
of
johnston
who
bluntly
undeceived
him
as
to
facts
and
told
him
that
further
resistance
would
be
a
crime
and
got
his
permission
to
treat
with
sherman
while
the
fallen
confederate
president
escaped
further
south
lee
object
was
to
make
his
way
along
the
north
side
of
the
appomattox
river
which
flows
east
through
petersburg
to
the
james
estuary
and
at
a
certain
point
strike
southwards
towards
johnston
army
he
fought
for
his
escape
with
all
his
old
daring
and
skill
while
hardly
less
vigorous
and
skilful
efforts
were
made
not
only
to
pursue
but
to
surround
him
grant
in
his
pursuit
sent
letters
of
courteous
entreaty
that
he
would
surrender
and
spare
further
slaughter
northern
cavalry
got
ahead
of
lee
tearing
up
the
railway
lines
he
had
hoped
to
use
and
blocking
possible
mountain
passes
and
his
supply
trains
were
being
cut
off
after
a
long
running
fight
and
one
last
fierce
battle
on
april
at
a
place
called
sailor
creek
lee
found
himself
on
april
at
appomattox
court
house
some
seventy
miles
west
of
petersburg
surrounded
beyond
hope
of
escape
on
that
day
he
and
grant
with
their
staffs
met
in
a
neighbouring
farmhouse
those
present
recalled
afterwards
the
contrast
of
the
stately
lee
and
the
plain
grant
arriving
in
his
haste
lee
greeted
meade
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
remarked
how
grey
he
had
grown
with
years
meade
gracefully
replied
that
lee
and
not
age
was
responsible
for
that
grant
had
started
quite
jubilant
on
the
news
that
lee
was
ready
to
surrender
but
in
presence
of
the
downfall
of
a
foe
who
had
fought
so
long
and
valiantly
he
fell
into
sadness
pleasant
talk
of
old
army
times
followed
and
he
had
almost
forgotten
as
he
declares
the
business
in
hand
when
lee
asked
him
on
what
terms
he
would
accept
surrender
grant
sat
down
and
wrote
not
knowing
when
he
began
what
he
should
go
on
to
write
as
he
wrote
he
thought
of
the
handsome
sword
lee
carried
instantly
he
added
to
his
terms
permission
for
every
southern
officer
to
keep
his
sword
and
his
horse
lee
read
the
paper
and
when
he
came
to
that
point
was
visibly
moved
he
gauged
his
man
and
he
ventured
to
ask
something
more
he
thought
he
said
grant
might
not
know
that
the
confederate
cavalry
troopers
owned
their
own
horses
grant
said
they
would
be
badly
wanted
on
the
farms
and
added
a
further
concession
accordingly
this
will
have
the
best
possible
effect
on
the
men
said
lee
it
will
do
much
towards
conciliating
our
people
grant
included
also
in
his
written
terms
words
of
general
pardon
to
confederate
officers
for
their
treason
this
was
an
inadvertent
breach
perhaps
of
lincoln
orders
but
it
was
one
which
met
with
no
objection
lee
retired
into
civil
life
and
devoted
himself
thereafter
to
his
neighbours
service
as
head
of
a
college
in
virginia
much
respected
very
free
with
alms
to
old
soldiers
and
not
much
caring
whether
they
had
fought
for
the
south
or
for
the
north
grant
did
not
wait
to
set
foot
in
the
capital
which
he
had
conquered
but
the
main
business
being
over
posted
off
with
all
haste
to
see
his
son
settled
in
at
school
lincoln
remained
at
city
point
till
april
when
he
started
back
by
steamer
those
who
were
with
him
on
the
two
days
voyage
told
afterwards
of
the
happy
talk
as
of
a
quiet
family
party
rejoicing
in
the
return
of
peace
somebody
said
that
jefferson
davis
really
ought
to
be
hanged
the
reply
came
in
the
quotation
that
he
might
almost
have
expected
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
on
the
second
day
sunday
the
president
read
to
them
parts
of
macbeth
sumner
who
was
one
of
them
recalled
that
he
read
twice
over
the
lines
duncan
is
in
his
grave
after
life
fitful
fever
he
sleeps
well
treason
has
done
his
worst
nor
steel
nor
poison
malice
domestic
foreign
levy
nothing
can
touch
him
further
on
the
tuesday
april
a
triumphant
crowd
came
to
the
white
house
to
greet
lincoln
he
made
them
a
speech
carefully
prepared
in
substance
rather
than
in
form
dealing
with
the
question
of
reconstruction
in
the
south
with
special
reference
to
what
was
already
in
progress
in
louisiana
the
precise
points
of
controversy
that
arose
in
this
regard
hardly
matter
now
lincoln
disclaimed
any
wish
to
insist
pedantically
upon
any
detailed
plan
of
his
but
he
declared
his
wish
equally
to
keep
clear
of
any
merely
pedantic
points
of
controversy
with
any
in
the
south
who
were
loyally
striving
to
revive
state
government
with
acceptance
of
the
union
and
without
slavery
and
he
urged
that
genuine
though
small
beginnings
should
be
encouraged
he
regretted
that
in
louisiana
his
wish
for
the
enfranchisement
of
educated
negroes
and
of
negro
soldiers
had
not
been
followed
but
as
the
freedom
of
the
negroes
was
unreservedly
accepted
as
provision
was
made
for
them
in
the
public
schools
and
the
new
state
constitution
allowed
the
legislature
to
enfranchise
them
there
was
clear
gain
concede
that
the
new
government
of
louisiana
is
only
to
what
it
should
be
as
the
egg
is
to
the
fowl
we
shall
sooner
have
the
fowl
by
hatching
the
egg
than
by
smashing
it
what
has
been
said
of
louisiana
will
apply
generally
to
other
states
so
new
and
unprecedented
he
ended
is
the
whole
case
that
no
exclusive
and
inflexible
plan
can
safely
be
prescribed
as
to
details
and
collaterals
such
exclusive
and
inflexible
plan
would
surely
become
a
new
entanglement
important
principles
may
and
must
be
inflexible
in
the
present
situation
as
the
phrase
goes
it
may
be
my
duty
to
make
some
new
announcement
to
the
people
of
the
south
i
am
considering
and
shall
not
fail
to
act
when
satisfied
that
action
will
be
proper
a
full
generation
has
had
cause
to
lament
that
that
announcement
was
never
to
be
made
on
good
friday
april
with
solemn
religious
service
the
union
flag
was
hoisted
again
on
fort
sumter
by
general
anderson
its
old
defender
on
that
morning
there
was
a
cabinet
council
in
washington
seward
was
absent
in
bed
with
an
injury
from
a
carriage
accident
grant
was
there
a
little
anxious
to
get
news
from
sherman
lincoln
was
in
a
happy
mood
he
had
earlier
that
morning
enjoyed
greatly
a
talk
with
robert
lincoln
about
the
young
man
new
experience
of
soldiering
he
now
told
grant
and
the
cabinet
that
good
news
was
coming
from
sherman
he
knew
it
he
said
for
last
night
he
had
dreamed
a
dream
which
had
come
to
him
several
times
before
in
this
dream
whenever
it
came
he
was
sailing
in
a
ship
of
a
peculiar
build
indescribable
but
always
the
same
and
being
borne
on
it
with
great
speed
towards
a
dark
and
undefined
shore
he
had
always
dreamed
this
before
victory
he
dreamed
it
before
antietam
before
murfreesborough
before
gettysburg
before
vicksburg
grant
observed
bluntly
that
murfreesborough
had
not
been
a
victory
or
of
any
consequence
anyway
lincoln
persisted
on
this
topic
undeterred
after
some
lesser
business
they
discussed
the
reconstruction
of
the
south
lincoln
rejoiced
that
congress
had
adjourned
and
the
disturbing
element
in
it
could
not
hinder
the
work
before
it
met
again
if
we
are
wise
and
discreet
we
shall
the
states
and
get
their
governments
in
successful
operation
with
order
prevailing
and
the
union
lastly
there
was
talk
of
the
treatment
of
rebels
and
of
the
demand
that
had
been
heard
for
persecution
and
bloody
work
no
one
need
expect
me
said
lincoln
to
take
any
part
in
hanging
or
killing
these
men
even
the
worst
of
them
frighten
them
out
of
the
country
open
the
gates
let
down
the
bars
scare
them
off
shoo
he
added
throwing
up
his
large
hands
like
a
man
scaring
sheep
we
must
extinguish
our
resentments
if
we
expect
harmony
and
union
there
is
too
much
of
the
desire
on
the
part
of
some
of
our
very
good
friends
to
be
masters
to
interfere
with
and
dictate
to
those
states
to
treat
the
people
not
as
fellow
citizens
there
is
too
little
respect
for
their
rights
i
do
not
sympathise
in
these
feelings
such
was
the
tenor
of
his
last
recorded
utterance
on
public
affairs
in
the
afternoon
and
lincoln
drove
together
and
he
talked
to
her
with
keen
pleasure
of
the
life
they
would
live
when
the
presidency
was
over
that
night
and
lincoln
went
to
the
theatre
for
the
day
was
not
observed
as
in
england
the
grants
were
to
have
been
with
them
but
changed
their
minds
and
left
washington
that
day
so
a
young
officer
major
rathbone
and
the
lady
engaged
to
him
both
of
them
thereafter
came
instead
the
theatre
was
crowded
many
officers
returned
from
the
war
were
there
and
eager
to
see
lincoln
the
play
was
our
american
cousin
a
play
in
which
the
part
of
lord
dundreary
was
afterwards
developed
and
made
famous
some
time
after
at
a
point
in
the
play
which
it
is
said
no
person
present
could
afterwards
remember
a
shot
was
heard
in
the
theatre
and
abraham
lincoln
fell
forward
upon
the
front
of
the
box
unconscious
and
dying
a
man
who
had
entered
the
box
unobserved
and
had
done
his
work
was
seen
to
strike
with
a
knife
at
major
rathbone
who
tried
to
seize
him
then
he
jumped
from
the
box
to
the
stage
he
caught
a
spur
in
the
drapery
and
fell
breaking
the
small
bone
of
his
leg
he
rose
shouted
sic
semper
tyrannis
the
motto
of
virginia
disappeared
behind
the
scenes
mounted
a
horse
that
was
in
waiting
at
the
stage
door
and
rode
away
this
was
john
wilkes
booth
brother
of
a
famous
actor
then
playing
hamlet
in
boston
he
was
an
actor
too
and
an
athletic
and
daring
youth
in
him
that
peculiarly
ferocious
political
passion
which
occasionally
showed
itself
among
southerners
was
further
inflamed
by
brandy
and
by
that
ranting
mode
of
thought
which
the
stage
develops
in
some
few
he
was
the
leader
of
a
conspiracy
which
aimed
at
compassing
the
deaths
of
others
besides
lincoln
andrew
johnson
the
was
to
die
so
was
seward
that
same
night
one
of
the
conspirators
a
gigantic
boy
of
feeble
mind
gained
entrance
to
seward
house
and
wounded
three
people
including
seward
himself
who
was
lying
already
injured
in
bed
and
received
four
or
five
wounds
neither
he
nor
the
others
died
the
or
mad
boy
another
man
whose
offense
consisted
in
having
been
asked
to
kill
johnson
and
refused
to
do
so
and
another
alleged
conspirator
a
woman
were
hanged
after
a
whose
proceedings
did
credit
neither
to
the
new
president
nor
to
others
concerned
booth
himself
after
many
adventures
was
shot
in
a
barn
in
which
he
stood
at
bay
and
which
had
been
set
on
fire
by
the
soldiers
pursuing
him
during
his
flight
he
is
said
to
have
felt
much
aggrieved
that
men
did
not
praise
him
as
they
had
praised
brutus
and
cassius
there
were
then
in
the
south
many
broken
and
many
permanently
embittered
men
indeed
the
temper
which
would
be
glad
at
death
could
be
found
here
and
there
and
notably
among
the
partisans
of
the
south
in
washington
but
if
it
be
wondered
what
measure
of
sympathy
there
was
for
booth
dark
deed
an
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
murder
of
lincoln
would
at
no
time
have
been
difficult
for
a
brave
man
fair
blows
were
now
as
powerless
as
foul
to
arrest
the
end
on
the
very
morning
when
lincoln
and
grant
at
the
cabinet
had
been
telling
of
their
hopes
and
fears
for
sherman
sherman
himself
at
raleigh
in
north
carolina
had
received
and
answered
a
letter
from
johnston
opening
negotiations
for
a
peaceful
surrender
three
days
later
he
was
starting
by
rail
for
greensborough
when
word
came
to
him
from
the
telegraph
operator
that
an
important
message
was
upon
the
wire
he
went
to
the
telegraph
box
and
heard
it
then
he
swore
the
telegraph
operator
to
secrecy
for
he
feared
that
some
provocation
might
lead
to
terrible
disorders
in
raleigh
if
his
army
flushed
with
triumph
were
to
learn
before
his
return
in
peace
the
news
that
for
many
days
after
hushed
their
accustomed
songs
and
shouts
and
cheering
into
a
silence
which
was
long
remembered
he
went
off
to
meet
johnston
and
requested
to
be
with
him
alone
in
a
farmhouse
near
there
he
told
him
of
the
murder
of
lincoln
the
perspiration
came
out
in
large
drops
on
johnston
forehead
says
sherman
who
watched
him
closely
he
exclaimed
that
it
was
a
disgrace
to
the
age
then
he
asked
to
know
whether
sherman
attributed
the
crime
to
the
confederate
authorities
sherman
could
assure
him
that
no
one
dreamed
of
such
a
suspicion
against
men
like
him
and
general
lee
but
he
added
that
he
was
not
so
sure
of
jefferson
davis
and
men
of
that
stripe
then
followed
some
delay
through
a
mistake
of
sherman
which
the
authorities
in
washington
reversed
but
in
a
few
days
all
was
settled
and
the
whole
of
the
forces
under
johnston
command
laid
down
their
arms
twenty
years
later
as
an
old
man
and
infirm
their
leader
left
his
southern
home
to
be
present
at
sherman
funeral
where
he
caught
a
chill
from
which
he
died
soon
after
jefferson
davis
was
captured
on
may
near
the
borders
of
florida
he
was
not
without
plausible
grounds
but
quite
unjustly
suspected
in
regard
to
the
murder
and
he
suffered
imprisonment
for
some
time
till
president
andrew
johnson
released
him
when
the
evidence
against
him
had
been
seen
to
be
worthless
he
lived
many
years
in
mississippi
and
wrote
memoirs
in
which
may
be
found
the
fullest
legal
argument
for
the
great
secession
his
own
view
of
his
quarrels
with
joseph
johnston
and
much
besides
amongst
other
things
he
tells
how
when
they
heard
the
news
of
lincoln
murder
some
troops
cheered
but
he
was
truly
sorry
for
the
reason
that
andrew
johnson
was
more
hostile
to
the
cause
than
lincoln
it
is
disappointing
to
think
of
one
who
played
a
memorable
part
in
history
with
much
determination
that
in
this
reminiscence
he
sized
his
stature
as
a
man
fairly
accurately
after
several
other
surrenders
of
southern
towns
and
small
scattered
forces
the
confederate
general
kirby
smith
in
texas
surrendered
to
general
canby
banks
successor
on
may
and
after
four
years
and
days
armed
resistance
to
the
union
was
at
an
end
on
the
night
of
good
friday
abraham
lincoln
had
been
carried
still
unconscious
to
a
house
near
the
theatre
his
sons
and
other
friends
were
summoned
he
never
regained
consciousness
a
look
of
unspeakable
peace
say
his
secretaries
who
were
there
came
over
his
worn
features
at
on
the
morning
of
april
stanton
watching
him
more
closely
than
the
rest
told
them
what
had
passed
in
the
words
now
he
belongs
to
the
ages
the
mourning
of
a
nation
voiced
to
later
times
by
some
of
the
best
lines
of
more
than
one
of
its
poets
and
deeper
and
more
prevailing
for
the
lack
of
comprehension
which
some
had
shown
him
before
followed
his
body
in
its
slow
progress
stopping
at
baltimore
where
once
his
life
had
been
threatened
for
the
homage
of
vast
crowds
stopping
at
new
york
where
among
the
huge
assembly
old
general
scott
came
to
bid
him
affectionate
farewell
stopping
at
other
cities
for
the
tribute
of
reverent
multitudes
to
springfield
his
home
of
so
many
years
where
on
may
it
was
laid
to
rest
after
the
burial
service
the
second
inaugural
was
read
over
his
grave
nor
could
better
words
than
his
own
have
been
chosen
to
honour
one
who
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
toward
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gave
him
to
see
the
right
had
striven
on
to
finish
the
work
that
he
was
in
in
england
apart
from
more
formal
tokens
of
a
regard
and
an
unfeigned
regret
punch
embodied
in
verse
of
rare
felicity
the
manly
contrition
of
its
editor
for
ignorant
derision
in
past
years
and
queen
victoria
symbolised
best
of
all
and
most
acceptably
to
americans
the
feeling
of
her
people
when
she
wrote
to
lincoln
as
a
widow
to
a
widow
nor
though
the
transactions
in
which
he
bore
his
part
were
but
little
understood
in
this
country
till
they
were
half
forgotten
has
tradition
ever
failed
to
give
him
by
just
instinct
his
rank
with
the
greatest
of
our
race
many
great
deeds
had
been
done
in
the
war
the
greatest
was
the
keeping
of
the
north
together
in
an
enterprise
so
arduous
and
an
enterprise
for
objects
so
confusedly
related
as
the
union
and
freedom
abraham
lincoln
did
this
nobody
else
could
have
done
it
to
do
it
he
bore
on
his
sole
shoulders
such
a
weight
of
care
and
pain
as
few
other
men
have
borne
when
it
was
over
it
seemed
to
the
people
that
he
had
all
along
been
thinking
their
real
thoughts
for
them
but
they
knew
that
this
was
because
he
had
fearlessly
thought
for
himself
he
had
been
able
to
save
the
nation
partly
because
he
saw
that
unity
was
not
to
be
sought
by
the
way
of
base
concession
he
had
been
able
to
free
the
slaves
partly
because
he
would
not
hasten
to
this
object
at
the
sacrifice
of
what
he
thought
a
larger
purpose
this
most
unrelenting
enemy
to
the
project
of
the
confederacy
was
the
one
man
who
had
quite
purged
his
heart
and
mind
from
hatred
or
even
anger
towards
his
of
the
south
that
fact
came
to
be
seen
in
the
south
too
and
generations
in
america
are
likely
to
remember
it
when
all
other
features
of
his
statecraft
have
grown
indistinct
a
thousand
reminiscences
ludicrous
or
pathetic
passing
into
myth
but
enshrining
hard
fact
will
prove
to
them
that
this
great
feature
of
his
policy
was
a
matter
of
more
than
policy
they
will
remember
it
as
adding
a
peculiar
lustre
to
the
renovation
of
their
national
existence
as
no
small
part
of
the
glory
surpassing
that
of
former
wars
which
has
become
the
common
heritage
of
north
and
south
for
perhaps
not
many
conquerors
and
certainly
few
successful
statesmen
have
escaped
the
tendency
of
power
to
harden
or
at
least
to
narrow
their
human
sympathies
but
in
this
man
a
natural
wealth
of
tender
compassion
became
richer
and
more
tender
while
in
the
stress
of
deadly
conflict
he
developed
an
astounding
strength
beyond
his
own
country
some
of
us
recall
his
name
as
the
greatest
among
those
associated
with
the
cause
of
popular
government
he
would
have
liked
this
tribute
and
the
element
of
truth
in
it
is
plain
enough
yet
it
demands
one
final
consideration
he
accepted
the
institutions
to
which
he
was
born
and
he
enjoyed
them
his
own
intense
experience
of
the
weakness
of
democracy
did
not
sour
him
nor
would
any
similar
experience
of
later
times
have
been
likely
to
do
so
yet
if
he
reflected
much
on
forms
of
government
it
was
with
a
dominant
interest
in
something
beyond
them
for
he
was
a
citizen
of
that
far
country
where
there
is
neither
aristocrat
nor
democrat
no
political
theory
stands
out
from
his
words
or
actions
but
they
show
a
most
unusual
sense
of
the
possible
dignity
of
common
men
and
common
things
his
humour
rioted
in
comparisons
between
potent
personages
and
jim
brother
or
old
judge
brown
drunken
coachman
for
the
reason
for
which
the
rarely
jesting
wordsworth
found
a
hero
in
the
or
in
nelson
and
a
villain
in
napoleon
or
in
peter
bell
he
could
use
and
respect
and
pardon
and
overrule
his
far
more
accomplished
ministers
because
he
stood
up
to
them
with
no
more
fear
or
cringing
with
no
more
dislike
or
envy
or
disrespect
than
he
had
felt
when
he
stood
up
long
before
to
jack
armstrong
he
faced
the
difficulties
and
terrors
of
his
high
office
with
that
same
mind
with
which
he
had
paid
his
way
as
a
poor
man
or
navigated
a
boat
in
rapids
or
in
floods
if
he
had
a
theory
of
democracy
it
was
contained
in
this
condensed
note
which
he
wrote
perhaps
as
an
autograph
a
year
or
two
before
his
presidency
as
i
would
not
be
a
slave
so
i
would
not
be
a
master
this
expresses
my
idea
of
democracy
whatever
differs
from
this
to
the
extent
of
the
difference
is
no
a
lincoln
appendix
bibliographical
note
a
complete
bibliography
of
books
dealing
specially
with
lincoln
and
of
books
throwing
important
light
upon
his
life
or
upon
the
history
of
the
american
civil
war
can
not
be
attempted
here
the
author
aims
only
at
mentioning
the
books
which
have
been
of
greatest
use
to
him
and
a
few
others
to
which
reference
ought
obviously
to
be
made
the
chief
authorities
for
the
life
of

are
abraham

a

by
john

and
john

his
private

for

the

of
abraham

by
herndon
and
weik
appleton
london
and
new
york
there
are
numerous
short
biographies
of
lincoln
but
among
these
it
is
not
invidious
to
mention
as
the
best
expressing
as
it
does
the
mature
judgment
of
the
highest
authority
a
short
life
of
abraham
lincoln
by
john
nicolay
the
century
company
new
york
the
author
may
be
allowed
to
refer
moreover
to
the
interest
aroused
in
him
as
a
boy
by
abraham
lincoln
by
leland
in
the
new
plutarch
series
marcus
ward
london
and
to
the
light
he
has
much
later
derived
from
abraham
lincoln
by
john
morse
junior
houghton
mifflin
company
boston
among
studies
of
lincoln
containing
a
wealth
of
illustrative
stories
a
very
high
place
is
due
to
the
true
abraham
lincoln
by
william
eleroy
curtis
the
j
lippincott
company
philadelphia
and
london
for
the
history
of
america
at
the
period
concerned
the
reader
may
be
most
confidently
referred
to
a
work
which
by
plentiful
extracts
and
citations
enables
its
writer
judgment
to
be
checked
without
detracting
from
the
interest
and
power
of
his
narrative
namely
history
of
the
united
states
by
james
ford
rhodes
in
seven
volumes
the
macmillan
company
london
and
new

among
the
shorter
complete

some
ways
complementary

in
their
different
points
of

are
alexander

and
historical

by

almost
every
point
in
regard
to

practice
is
fully
treated
in
the
american
commonwealth
by
viscount
bryce
two
volumes
the
macmillan
company
london
and
new
york
for
the
attitude
of
the
british
government
during
the
war
the
conclusive
authority
is
the
correspondence
to
be
found
in
the
life
of
lord
john
russell
by
sir
spencer
walpole
two
volumes
longmans
green
london

and
light
on
the
attitude
of
the
english
people
is
thrown
by
the
life
of
john
bright
by
trevelyan
constable
london
and
houghton
mifflin
company
boston
with
respect
to
the
military
history
of
the
civil
war
the
author
is
specially
indebted
to
the
civil
war
in
the
united

by
birkbeck
wood
and
major
edmonds
with
an
introduction
by
spenser
wilkinson
methuen
london
and
putnam
new

which
is
the
only
concise
and
complete
history
of
the
war
written
with
full
knowledge
of
all
recent
works
bearing
on
the
subject
chapters
in
the
cambridge
modern
history
give
a
very
lucid
narrative
of
the
war
among
works
of
special
interest
bearing
on
the
war
though
not
much
concerning
the
subject
of
this
book
it
is
only
necessary
to
mention
jackson

colonel
henderson
two
volumes
longmans
london

new

and
story
of
the

by
ropes
putnam
london
and
new

it
may
be
added
that
a
life
of
general
robert
lee
had
been
projected
as
a
companion
volume
to
this
in
the
same
series
by
frederick
maurice
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
though
suspended
by
the
present
war
this
book
may
still
be
written
existing
biographies
of
lee
are
disappointing
it
has
been
especially
in
view
of
this
intended
book
on
lee
outside
the
scope
of
this
volume
to
present
the
history
of
the
civil
war
with
special
reference
to
the
southern
actors
in
it
but
memoirs
of
jefferson
davis
must
be
here
referred
to
as
in
some
sense
an
authoritative
though
not
a
very
attractive
or
interesting
exposition
of
the
views
of
southern
statesmen
at
the
time
an
interesting
sidelight
on
the
war
may
be
found
in
life
with
the
confederate
army
by
watson
being
the
experiences
of
a
scotchman
who
for
a
time
served
under
the
confederacy
in
regard
to
slavery
and
to
southern
society
before
the
war
the
author
has
made
much
use
of
our
slave
states
by
frederick
law
olmsted
dix
and
edwards
new
york
and
other
works
of
the
same
author
olmsted
was
a
northerner
but
his
very
full
observations
can
be
checked
by
the
numerous
quotations
on
the
same
subject
collected
by
rhodes
in
his
history
for
the
history
of
the
south
since
the
war
and
the
present
position
of
the
negroes

longmans
green
london

a
book
to
which
the
author
is
also
indebted
for
other
interesting
matter
the
personal
memoirs
and
especially
the
autobiographies
dealing
with
the
civil
war
are
very
numerous
and
the
author
therefore
would
only
wish
to
mention
those
which
seem
to
him
of
altogether
unusual
interest
personal

may
be

the
delegations
from
baltimore
called
to
protest
against
the
pollution
of
the
soil
of
maryland
by
the
feet
of
the
soldiers
marching
across
it
to
fight
against
the
south
they
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
the
president
reply
we
must
have
troops
and
as
they
can
neither
crawl
maryland
nor
fly
it
they
must
come
across
it
when
the
war
had
actually
begun
he
delighted
in
the
soldiers
grim
humor
in
the
face
of
death
he
told
story
after
story
about
the
boys
laughing
with
tears
in
his
gray
eyes
at
their
heroism
in
danger
he
never
laughed
at
the
private
soldier
except
in
the
pride
of
his
hearty
patriotism
but
he
made
constant
fun
of
the
assumptions
of
generals
and
other
high
officials
the
stories
he
most
enjoyed
telling
were
of
the
soldiers
scoffing
at
rank
and
pretension
he
delighted
in
the
following
a
picket
challenged
a
tug
going
up
broad
river
south
carolina
with
who
goes
there
the
secretary
of
war
and
foster
was
the
pompous
reply
aw
we
got
enough
up
here
why
do
you
bring
us
up
some
hardtack
on
another
occasion
a
friend
burst
into
his
room
to
tell
him
that
a
and
twelve
army
mules
had
been
carried
off
by
a
confederate
raid
how
unfortunate
those
mules
cost
us
two
hundred
dollars
apiece
was
the
president
only
reply
lincoln
was
a
very
abstemious
man
ate
very
little
and
drank
nothing
but
water
not
from
principle
but
because
he
did
not
like
wine
or
spirits
once
in
rather
dark
days
early
in
the
war
a
temperance
committee
came
to
him
and
said
that
the
reason
we
did
not
win
was
because
our
army
drank
so
much
whisky
as
to
bring
the
curse
of
the
lord
upon
them
he
said
in
reply
that
it
was
rather
unfair
on
the
part
of
the
aforesaid
curse
as
the
other
side
drank
more
and
worse
whisky
than
ours
did
some
one
urged
president
lincoln
to
place
general
frémont
in
command
of
some
station
while
the
president
did
not
want
to
offend
his
friend
at
a
rather
critical
time
of
the
war
he
pushed
him
gently
and
firmly
aside
in
this
wise
he
said
he
did
not
know
where
to
place
general
frémont
and
it
reminded
him
of
an
old
man
who
advised
his
son
to
take
a
wife
to
which
the
young
man
responded
whose
wife
shall
i
take
on
one
occasion
exasperated
at
the
discrepancy
between
the
aggregate
of
troops
forwarded
to
mcclellan
and
the
number
of
men
the
general
reported
as
having
received
lincoln
exclaimed
sending
men
to
that
army
is
like
shoveling
fleas
across
a
barnyard
half
of
them
never
get
there
lincoln
orders
to
his
generals
are
filled
with
the
kindly
courtesy
the
direct
argument
and
the
dry
humor
which
are
so
characteristic
of
the
man
to
grant
who
had
telegraphed
if
the
thing
is
pressed
i
think
that
lee
will
surrender
lincoln
replied
let
the
thing
be
pressed
to
mcclellan
gently
chiding
him
for
his
inactivity
i
have
just
read
your
despatch
about
sore
tongue
and
fatigued
horse
will
you
pardon
me
for
asking
what
the
horses
of
your
army
have
done
since
the
battle
of
antietam
that
fatigues
anything
referring
to
general
mcclellan
inactivity
president
lincoln
once
expressed
his
impatience
by
saying
mcclellan
is
a
pleasant
and
scholarly
gentleman
he
is
an
admirable
engineer
but
he
seems
to
have
a
special
talent
for
stationary
engineering
after
a
long
period
of
inaction
on
the
part
of
the
union
forces
a
telegram
from
cumberland
gap
reached
lincoln
saying
that
firing
was
heard
in
the
direction
of
knoxville
the
president
simply
remarked
that
he
was
glad
of
it
as
general
burnside
was
in
a
perilous
position
in
tennessee
at
that
time
those
present
were
greatly
surprised
at
lincoln
calm
view
of
the
case
you
see
said
the
president
it
reminds
me
of
mistress
sallie
ward
a
neighbor
of
mine
who
had
a
very
large
family
occasionally
one
of
her
numerous
progeny
would
be
heard
crying
in
some
place
upon
which
ward
would
exclaim
one
of
my
children
not
dead
yet
writing
to
hooker
who
succeeded
burnside
lincoln
said
i
believe
you
to
be
a
brave
and
skilful
soldier
which
of
course
i
like
i
also
believe
you
do
not
mix
politics
with
your
profession
in
which
you
are
right
you
have
confidence
in
yourself
which
is
a
valuable
if
not
indispensable
quality
you
are
ambitious
which
within
reasonable
bounds
does
good
rather
than
harm
but
i
think
that
during
general
burnside
command
of
the
army
you
have
taken
counsel
with
your
ambition
and
thwarted
him
as
much
as
you
could
in
which
you
did
a
great
wrong
to
the
country
and
to
a
most
meritorious
and
honorable
i
have
heard
in
such
a
way
as
to
believe
it
of
your
recently
saying
that
both
the
army
and
the
government
needed
a
dictator
of
course
it
is
not
for
this
but
in
spite
of
it
that
i
have
given
you
the
command
only
those
generals
who
gain
successes
can
set
up
dictators
what
i
now
ask
of
you
is
military
success
and
i
will
risk
the
dictatorship
general
fry
who
was
of
the
war
department
and
received
daily
instructions
from
the
president
in
regard
to
the
draft
for
troops
which
was
one
of
the
most
embarrassing
and
perplexing
questions
that
arose
during
the
war
illustrates
this
peculiar
trait
by
an
anecdote
he
says
upon
one
occasion
the
governor
of
a
state
came
to
my
office
bristling
with
complaints
in
relation
to
the
number
of
troops
required
from
his
state
the
details
of
drafting
the
men
and
the
plan
of
compulsory
service
in
general
i
found
it
impossible
to
satisfy
his
demands
and
accompanied
him
to
the
secretary
of
war
office
whence
after
a
stormy
interview
with
stanton
he
went
alone
to
press
his
ultimatum
upon
the
highest
authority
after
i
had
waited
anxiously
for
some
hours
expecting
important
orders
or
decisions
from
the
president
or
at
least
a
summons
to
the
white
house
for
explanation
the
governor
returned
and
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
that
he
was
going
home
by
the
next
train
and
merely
dropping
in
to
say
neither
the
business
he
came
upon
nor
his
interview
with
the
president
was
alluded
to
as
soon
as
i
could
see
lincoln
i
said
president
i
am
very
anxious
to
learn
how
you
disposed
of
governor
he
went
to
your
office
from
the
war
department
in
a
towering
rage
i
suppose
you
found
it
necessary
to
make
large
concessions
to
him
as
he
returned
from
you
entirely
satisfied
no
he
replied
did
not
concede
anything
you
know
how
that
illinois
farmer
managed
the
big
log
that
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
field
to
the
inquiries
of
his
neighbors
one
sunday
he
announced
that
he
had
got
rid
of
the
big
log
got
rid
of
it
said
they
how
did
you
do
it
it
was
too
big
to
haul
out
too
knotty
to
split
and
too
wet
and
soggy
to
burn
what
did
you
do
well
now
boys
replied
the
farmer
if
you
wo
divulge
the
secret
i
tell
you
how
i
got
rid
of
it
i
it
now
said
lincoln
tell
anybody
but
that
the
way
i
got
rid
of
governor
i
him
but
it
took
me
three
mortal
hours
to
do
it
and
i
was
afraid
every
moment
he
see
what
i
was
at
commenting
on
jeb
stuart
raid
into
maryland
and
pennsylvania
and
his
complete
circuit
of
mcclellan
army
and
his
return
over
the
river
unharmed
despite
mcclellan
attempt
to
head
him
off
lincoln
remarked
when
i
was
a
boy
we
used
to
play
a
game
three
times
round
and
out
stuart
has
been
round
twice
if
he
goes
round
him
once
more
gentlemen
mcclellan
will
be
out
the
general
ascribed
stuart
success
to
his
lack
of
horses
and
telegraphed
that
unless
the
army
got
more
horses
there
would
be
similar
expeditions

dear
general
presuming
on
the
acquaintance
with
you
which
i
had
the
honour
and
pleasure
of
making
last
november
at
lexington
while
travelling
in
virginia
i
venture
now
to
write
to
you
under
these
circumstances
you
may
remember
that
at
the
time
i
presented
to
you
my
letter
of
introduction
i
told
you
that
two
other
englishmen
friends
of
mine
who
had
come
with
me
to
america
were
then
making
a
tour
through
georgia
the
carolinas
and
some
other
southern
states
one
of
them
kennaway
was
so
much
interested
with
all
he
saw
and
the
people
at
home
have
appreciated
his
letters
descriptive
of
it
so
well
that
he
is
intending
to
publish
a
short
account
of
his
visit
not
having
however
had
an
introduction
to
yourself
he
is
anxious
to
avail
himself
of
the
somewhat
full
accounts
i
wrote
home
at
the
time
descriptive
of
my
most
interesting
interview
with
you
and
with
this
view
he
has
asked
me
to
put
into
the
shape
of
a
letter
all
those
more
prominent
points
which
occur
to
me
as
gathered
from
my
letters
and
my
recollection
and
which
are
likely
to
interest
and
instruct
the
english
public
i
have
after
some
hesitation
acceded
to
the
request
a
hesitation
caused
mainly
by
the
fact
that
at
the
time
i
saw
you
i
neither
prepared
my
notes
with
a
view
to
publication
nor
did
i
inform
you
that
there
was
any
chance
of
what
you
told
me
being
repeated
i
may
add
that
i
never
until
a
month
or
two
ago
had
the
slightest
thought
of
publishing
anything
and
in
fact
have
constantly
resisted
the
many
applications
by
my
friends
that
i
should
let
my
letters
see
the
light
my
object
in
now
writing
to
you
is
to
know
whether
you
have
any
objection
to
my
giving
my
friend
the
inclosed
short
account
of
our
interview
as
it
would
i
am
convinced
add
greatly
to
the
interest
of
the
narrative
if
you
have
no
objection
to
this
perhaps
you
would
kindly
correct
any
statements
put
into
your
mouth
which
are
not
quite
accurate
or
expunge
anything
which
might
prejudice
you
with
the
public
either
of
the
north
or
the
south
if
unluckily
anything
of
this
nature
should
have
crept
in
my
letters
were
written
a
day
or
two
after
the
conversation
but
you
had
so
much
of
interest
and
new
to
tell
me
that
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
i
may
not
have
confused
names
of
battles
in
some
instances
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
deliver
my
part
of
the
performance
early
in
september
to
the
publishers
and
therefore
i
should
feel
much
obliged
by
your
sending
me
an
answer
at
your
earliest
convenience
there
will
be
a
mail
due
here
about
the
first
of
that
month
leaving
the
united
states
on
wednesday
the
and
i
shall
therefore
wait
till
its
arrival
before
sending
my
letter
to
kennaway
but
should
i
not
hear
from
you
then
i
shall
consider
you
have
no
objections
to
make
or
alterations
to
suggest
and
act
accordingly
if
you
have
any
new
facts
which
you
think
it
desirable
should
be
known
by
the
public
it
will
give
me
much
pleasure
to
be
the
medium
of
their
communication
i
am
sure
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
with
what
keen
interest
i
have
read
all
the
accounts
from
your
continent
of
the
proceedings
in
congress
and
elsewhere
in
connection
with
the
reconstruction
of
the
south
i
do
sincerely
trust
it
may
be
eventually
effected
in
a
way
satisfactory
to
the
south
and
i
most
deeply
deplore
the
steps
taken
by
the
radical
side
of
the
house
to
set
the
two
north
and
south
by
the
ears
again
president
johnson
policy
seems
to
me
to
be
that
which
if
pursued
would
be
most
likely
to
contribute
to
the
consolidation
of
the
country
but
i
am
both
surprised
and
pained
to
find
how
little
power
the
executive
has
against
so
strong
a
faction
as
the
radicals
who
while
they
claim
to
represent
the
north
do
in
fact
but
misrepresent
the
country
i
am
sure
you
will
believe
that
i
say
with
sincerity
that
i
always
take
great
interest
in
anything
i
hear
said
or
that
i
read
of
yourself
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
even
with
all
the
rancour
of
the
northern
radicals
against
the
south
it
is
little
they
find
of
ill
to
say
of
you
hoping
you
will
not
think
i
am
doing
wrong
in
the
course
i
propose
to
take
and
that
your
answer
may
be
satisfactory

remain

dear
i
received
your
letter
of
the
ult
what
i
stated
to
you
in
conversation
during
the
visit
which
you
did
me
the
honour
to
pay
me
in
november
last
was
entirely
for
your
own
information
and
was
in
no
way
intended
for
publication
my
only
object
was
to
gratify
the
interest
which
you
apparently
evinced
on
the
several
topics
which
were
introduced
and
to
point
to
facts
which
you
might
investigate
if
you
so
desired
in
your
own
way
i
have
an
objection
to
the
publication
of
my
private
conversations
which
are
never
intended
but
for
those
to
whom
they
are
addressed
i
can
not
therefore
without
an
entire
disregard
of
the
rule
which
i
have
followed
in
other
cases
and
in
violation
of
my
own
sense
of
propriety
assent
to
what
you
propose
i
hope
therefore
you
will
excuse
me
what
you
may
think
proper
to
publish
i
hope
will
be
the
result
of
your
own
observations
and
convictions
and
not
on
my
authority
in
the
hasty
perusal
which
i
have
been
obliged
to
give
the
manuscript
inclosed
to
me
i
perceive
many
inaccuracies
resulting
as
much
perhaps
from
my
imperfect
narration
as
from
misapprehension
on
your
part
though
fully
appreciating
your
kind
wish
to
correct
certain
erroneous
statements
as
regards
myself
i
prefer
remaining
silent
to
doing
anything
that
might
excite
angry
discussion
at
this
time
when
strong
efforts
are
being
made
by
conservative
men
north
and
south
to
sustain
president
johnson
in
his
policy
which
i
think
offers
the
only
means
of
healing
the
lamentable
divisions
of
the
country
and
which
the
result
of
the
late
convention
at
philadelphia
gives
great
promise
of
doing
thanking
you
for
the
opportunity
afforded
me
of
expressing
my
opinion
before
executing
your
purpose
i
am
e
lee
the
following
is
saunders
account
of
the
interview
on
only
one
subject
would
he
talk
at
any
length
about
his
own
conduct
and
that
was
with
reference
to
the
treatment
of
the
federal
prisoners
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
he
seemed
to
feel
deeply
the
backhanded
stigma
cast
upon
him
by
his
having
been
included
by
name
in
the
first
indictment
framed
against
wirz
though
he
was
afterward
omitted
from
the
new
charges
he
explained
to
me
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
arranged
with
mcclellan
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
how
he
had
after
the
battles
of
manassas
fredericksburg
and
i
think
chancellorsville
sent
all
the
wounded
over
to
the
enemy
on
the
engagement
of
their
generals
to
parole
them
he
also
told
me
that
on
several
occasions
his
commissary
generals
had
come
to
him
after
a
battle
and
represented
that
he
had
not
rations
enough
both
for
prisoners
and
the
army
when
the
former
had
to
be
sent
several
march
to
their
place
of
confinement
and
he
had
always
given
orders
that
the
wants
of
the
prisoners
should
be
first
attended
to
as
from
their
position
they
could
not
save
themselves
from
starvation
by
foraging
or
otherwise
as
the
army
could
when
in
straits
for
provisions
the
general
also
explained
how
every
effort
had
always
been
made
by
the
confederates
to
do
away
with
the
necessity
of
retaining
prisoners
by
offering
every
facility
for
exchange
till
at
last
when
all
exchange
was
refused
they
found
themselves
with
prisoners
for
whom
they
were
quite
unable
to
do
as
much
as
they
wished
in
the
way
of
food
he
stated
furthermore
that
many
of
their
hardships
arose
from
the
necessity
of
constantly
changing
the
prisons
to
prevent
recapture
with
the
management
of
the
prisons
he
assured
me
he
had
no
more
to
do
than
i
had
and
did
not
even
know
that
wirz
was
in
charge
of
andersonville
prison
at
least
i
think
he
asserted
this
till
after
the
war
was
over
i
could
quite
sympathise
with
him
in
his
feeling
of
pain
under
which
his
generous
nature
evidently
suffered
that
the
authorities
at
washington
should
have
included
him
and
others
similarly
circumstanced
in
this
charge
of
cruelty
at
the
time
that
letters
written
by
himself
general
lee
taken
in
richmond
when
captured
complaining
that
the
troops
in
his
army
had
actually
been
for
days
together
on
several
occasions
without
an
ounce
of
meat
were
in
possession
of
the
military
authorities
when
discussing
the
state
of
feeling
in
england
with
regard
to
the
war
he
assured
me
that
it
had
all
along
given
him
the
greatest
pleasure
to
feel
that
the
southern
cause
had
the
sympathies
of
so
many
in
the
country
to
which
he
looked
as
a
second
home
but
in
answer
to
my
questions
he
replied
that
he
had
never
expected
us
to
give
them
material
aid
and
added
that
he
thought
all
governments
were
right
in
studying
only
the
interests
of
their
own
people
and
in
not
going
to
war
for
an
when
they
had
no
distinct
cause
of
quarrel
on
the
subject
of
slavery
he
assured
me
that
he
had
always
been
in
favour
of
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
and
that
in
virginia
the
feeling
had
been
strongly
inclining
in
the
same
direction
till
the
enthusiasm
amounting
to
rancour
of
the
abolitionists
in
the
north
had
turned
the
southern
tide
of
feeling
in
the
other
direction
in
virginia
about
thirty
years
ago
an
ordinance
for
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
had
been
rejected
by
only
a
small
majority
and
every
one
fully
expected
at
the
next
convention
it
would
have
been
carried
but
for
the
above
cause
he
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
scarcely
a
virginian
now
who
was
not
glad
that
the
subject
had
been
definitely
settled
though
nearly
all
regretted
that
they
had
not
been
wise
enough
to
do
it
themselves
the
first
year
of
the
war
allusion
was
made
by
him
to
a
conversation
he
had
with
a
distinguished
countryman
of
mine
he
had
been
visiting
a
large
slave
plantation
shirley
on
the
james
river
the
englishman
had
told
him
that
the
working
population
were
better
cared
for
there
than
in
any
country
he
had
ever
visited
but
that
he
must
never
expect
an
approval
of
the
institution
of
slavery
by
england
or
aid
from
her
in
any
cause
in
which
that
question
was
involved
taking
these
facts
and
the
antipathy
of
the
mass
of
the
english
to
the
institution
into
consideration
he
said
he
had
never
expected
help
from
england
the
people
the
south
as
the
expression
is
in
the
main
though
scarcely
unanimously
seem
to
hold
much
the
same
language
as
general
lee
with
reference
to
our
neutrality
and
to
be
much
less
bitter
than
northerners
generally
who
i
must
confess
in
my
own
opinion
have
much
less
cause
to
complain
of
our
interpretation
of
the
laws
of
neutrality
than
the
south
i
may
mention
here
by
way
of
parenthesis
that
i
was
on
two
separate
occasions
once
in
washington
and
once
in
lexington
told
that
there
were
many
people
in
the
country
who
wished
that
general
washington
had
never
lived
and
that
they
were
still
subjects
of
queen
victoria
but
i
should
certainly
say
as
a
rule
the
americans
are
much
too
well
satisfied
with
themselves
for
this
feeling
to
be
at
all
common
general
lee
in
the
course
of
this
to
me
most
interesting
evening
gave
me
many
details
of
the
war
too
long
to
put
on
paper
but
with
reference
to
the
small
result
of
their
numerous
victories
accounted
for
it
in
this
way
the
force
which
the
confederates
brought
to
bear
was
so
often
inferior
in
numbers
to
that
of
the
yankees
that
the
more
they
followed
up
the
victory
against
one
portion
of
the
enemy
line
the
more
did
they
lay
themselves
open
to
being
surrounded
by
the
remainder
of
the
enemy
he
likened
the
operation
to
a
man
breasting
a
wave
of
the
sea
who
as
rapidly
as
he
clears
a
way
before
him
is
enveloped
by
the
very
water
he
has
displaced
he
spoke
of
the
final
surrender
as
inevitable
owing
to
the
superiority
in
numbers
of
the
enemy
his
own
army
had
during
the
last
few
weeks
suffered
materially
from
defection
in
its
ranks
and
discouraged
by
failures
and
worn
out
by
hardships
had
at
the
time
of
the
surrender
only
men
under
arms
and
this
little
army
was
almost
surrounded
by
one
of
they
might
the
general
said
with
an
air
piteous
to
behold
have
cut
their
way
out
as
they
had
done
before
but
looking
upon
the
struggle
as
hopeless
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
him
say
that
he
thought
it
cruel
to
prolong
it
in
two
other
battles
he
named
sharpsburg
and
chancellorsville
i
think
he
said
the
confederates
were
to
the
federals
in
point
of
numbers
as
to
and
as
to
respectively
so
that
the
mere
disparity
of
numbers
was
not
sufficient
to
convince
him
of
the
necessity
of
surrender
but
feeling
that
his
own
army
was
persuaded
of
the
ultimate
hopelessness
of
the
contest
as
evidenced
by
their
defection
he
took
the
course
of
surrendering
his
army
in
lieu
of
reserving
it
for
utter
annihilation
turning
to
the
political
bearing
of
the
important
question
at
issue
the
great
southern
general
gave
me
at
some
length
his
feelings
with
regard
to
the
abstract
right
of
secession
this
right
he
told
me
was
held
as
a
constitutional
maxim
at
the
south
as
to
its
exercise
at
the
time
on
the
part
of
the
south
he
was
distinctly
opposed
and
it
was
not
until
lincoln
issued
a
proclamation
for
men
to
invade
the
south
which
was
deemed
clearly
unconstitutional
that
virginia
withdrew
from
the
united
states
we
discussed
a
variety
of
other
topics
and
at
eleven
when
i
rose
to
go
he
begged
me
to
stay
on
as
he
found
the
nights
full
long
his
son
general
custis
lee
who
had
distinguished
himself
much
during
the
war
but
whom
i
had
not
the
good
fortune
of
meeting
is
the
only
one
of
his
family
at
present
with
him
at
lexington
where
he
occupies
the
position
of
a
professor
in
the
military
institute
of
virginia
this
college
had
cadets
in
it
when
the
war
broke
out
general
jackson
being
one
of
the
professors
at
one
moment
in
the
war
when
the
federals
were
advancing
steadily
up
the
shenandoah
valley
these
youths
from
to
years
of
age
were
marched
to
join
the
confederate
army
and
did
good
service
in
one
battle
at
newmarket
of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
later
in
my
letters
they
distinguished
themselves
in
a
conspicuous
way
under
the
leadership
of
colonel
shipp
who
is
still
their
commandant
by
a
brilliant
charge
they
contributed
in
a
great
measure
to
turn
the
tide
of
affairs
losing
nine
of
their
number
killed
and
more
than
forty
wounded
general
hunter
on
a
subsequent
occasion
when
occupying
lexington
with
a
body
of
federal
troops
quartered
his
men
in
the
military
institute
for
several
days
and
on
leaving
had
the
building
a
very
handsome
and
extensive
one
fired
in
numerous
places
completely
destroying
all
but
the
external
walls
which
now
stand
the
professors
houses
stood
in
detached
positions
and
these
too
with
the
house
of
letcher
a
former
governor
of
the
state
he
also
burnt
to
the
ground
the
washington
college
the
presidency
of
which
general
lee
now
holds
they
also
ransacked
destroying
everything
it
contained
and
were
preparing
it
for
the
flames
to
which
they
were
with
difficulty
restrained
from
devoting
it
by
earnest
representations
of
its
strictly
educational
nature
