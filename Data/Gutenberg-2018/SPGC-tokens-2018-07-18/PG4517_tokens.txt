ethan
frome
by
edith
wharton
ethan
frome
i
had
the
story
bit
by
bit
from
various
people
and
as
generally
happens
in
such
cases
each
time
it
was
a
different
story
if
you
know
starkfield
massachusetts
you
know
the
if
you
know
the
you
must
have
seen
ethan
frome
drive
up
to
it
drop
the
reins
on
his
bay
and
drag
himself
across
the
brick
pavement
to
the
white
colonnade
and
you
must
have
asked
who
he
was
it
was
there
that
several
years
ago
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
and
the
sight
pulled
me
up
sharp
even
then
he
was
the
most
striking
figure
in
starkfield
though
he
was
but
the
ruin
of
a
man
it
was
not
so
much
his
great
height
that
marked
him
for
the
natives
were
easily
singled
out
by
their
lank
longitude
from
the
stockier
foreign
breed
it
was
the
careless
powerful
look
he
had
in
spite
of
a
lameness
checking
each
step
like
the
jerk
of
a
chain
there
was
something
bleak
and
unapproachable
in
his
face
and
he
was
so
stiffened
and
grizzled
that
i
took
him
for
an
old
man
and
was
surprised
to
hear
that
he
was
not
more
than
i
had
this
from
harmon
gow
who
had
driven
the
stage
from
bettsbridge
to
starkfield
in
days
and
knew
the
chronicle
of
all
the
families
on
his
line
he
looked
that
way
ever
since
he
had
his
and
years
ago
come
next
february
harmon
threw
out
between
reminiscent
pauses
the
it
was
i
gathered
from
the
same
informant
which
besides
drawing
the
red
gash
across
ethan
frome
forehead
had
so
shortened
and
warped
his
right
side
that
it
cost
him
a
visible
effort
to
take
the
few
steps
from
his
buggy
to
the
window
he
used
to
drive
in
from
his
farm
every
day
at
about
noon
and
as
that
was
my
own
hour
for
fetching
my
mail
i
often
passed
him
in
the
porch
or
stood
beside
him
while
we
waited
on
the
motions
of
the
distributing
hand
behind
the
grating
i
noticed
that
though
he
came
so
punctually
he
seldom
received
anything
but
a
copy
of
the
bettsbridge
eagle
which
he
put
without
a
glance
into
his
sagging
pocket
at
intervals
however
the
would
hand
him
an
envelope
addressed
to
zenobia
or
zeena
frome
and
usually
bearing
conspicuously
in
the
upper
corner
the
address
of
some
manufacturer
of
patent
medicine
and
the
name
of
his
specific
these
documents
my
neighbour
would
also
pocket
without
a
glance
as
if
too
much
used
to
them
to
wonder
at
their
number
and
variety
and
would
then
turn
away
with
a
silent
nod
to
the
every
one
in
starkfield
knew
him
and
gave
him
a
greeting
tempered
to
his
own
grave
mien
but
his
taciturnity
was
respected
and
it
was
only
on
rare
occasions
that
one
of
the
older
men
of
the
place
detained
him
for
a
word
when
this
happened
he
would
listen
quietly
his
blue
eyes
on
the
speaker
face
and
answer
in
so
low
a
tone
that
his
words
never
reached
me
then
he
would
climb
stiffly
into
his
buggy
gather
up
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
and
drive
slowly
away
in
the
direction
of
his
farm
it
was
a
pretty
bad
i
questioned
harmon
looking
after
frome
retreating
figure
and
thinking
how
gallantly
his
lean
brown
head
with
its
shock
of
light
hair
must
have
sat
on
his
strong
shoulders
before
they
were
bent
out
of
shape
wust
kind
my
informant
assented
enough
to
kill
most
men
but
the
fromes
are
tough
ethan
likely
touch
a
good
god
i
exclaimed
at
the
moment
ethan
frome
after
climbing
to
his
seat
had
leaned
over
to
assure
himself
of
the
security
of
a
wooden
box
also
with
a
druggist
label
on
it
which
he
had
placed
in
the
back
of
the
buggy
and
i
saw
his
face
as
it
probably
looked
when
he
thought
himself
alone
that
man
touch
a
hundred
he
looks
as
if
he
was
dead
and
in
hell
now
harmon
drew
a
slab
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
cut
off
a
wedge
and
pressed
it
into
the
leather
pouch
of
his
cheek
guess
he
been
in
starkfield
too
many
winters
most
of
the
smart
ones
get
why
did
he
somebody
had
to
stay
and
care
for
the
folks
there
war
ever
anybody
but
ethan
fust
his
father
then
his
mother
then
his
and
then
the
harmon
chuckled
sardonically
that
so
he
had
to
stay
i
see
and
since
then
they
had
to
care
for
him
harmon
thoughtfully
passed
his
tobacco
to
the
other
cheek
oh
as
to
that
i
guess
it
always
ethan
done
the
though
harmon
gow
developed
the
tale
as
far
as
his
mental
and
moral
reach
permitted
there
were
perceptible
gaps
between
his
facts
and
i
had
the
sense
that
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
story
was
in
the
gaps
but
one
phrase
stuck
in
my
memory
and
served
as
the
nucleus
about
which
i
grouped
my
subsequent
inferences
guess
he
been
in
starkfield
too
many
before
my
own
time
there
was
up
i
had
learned
to
know
what
that
meant
yet
i
had
come
in
the
degenerate
day
of
trolley
bicycle
and
rural
delivery
when
communication
was
easy
between
the
scattered
mountain
villages
and
the
bigger
towns
in
the
valleys
such
as
bettsbridge
and
shadd
falls
had
libraries
theatres
and
halls
to
which
the
youth
of
the
hills
could
descend
for
recreation
but
when
winter
shut
down
on
starkfield
and
the
village
lay
under
a
sheet
of
snow
perpetually
renewed
from
the
pale
skies
i
began
to
see
what
life
there
or
rather
its
negation
must
have
been
in
ethan
frome
young
manhood
i
had
been
sent
up
by
my
employers
on
a
job
connected
with
the
big
at
corbury
junction
and
a
carpenters
strike
had
so
delayed
the
work
that
i
found
myself
anchored
at
starkfield
the
nearest
habitable
spot
for
the
best
part
of
the
winter
i
chafed
at
first
and
then
under
the
hypnotising
effect
of
routine
gradually
began
to
find
a
grim
satisfaction
in
the
life
during
the
early
part
of
my
stay
i
had
been
struck
by
the
contrast
between
the
vitality
of
the
climate
and
the
deadness
of
the
community
day
by
day
after
the
december
snows
were
over
a
blazing
blue
sky
poured
down
torrents
of
light
and
air
on
the
white
landscape
which
gave
them
back
in
an
intenser
glitter
one
would
have
supposed
that
such
an
atmosphere
must
quicken
the
emotions
as
well
as
the
blood
but
it
seemed
to
produce
no
change
except
that
of
retarding
still
more
the
sluggish
pulse
of
starkfield
when
i
had
been
there
a
little
longer
and
had
seen
this
phase
of
crystal
clearness
followed
by
long
stretches
of
sunless
cold
when
the
storms
of
february
had
pitched
their
white
tents
about
the
devoted
village
and
the
wild
cavalry
of
march
winds
had
charged
down
to
their
support
i
began
to
understand
why
starkfield
emerged
from
its
six
months
siege
like
a
starved
garrison
capitulating
without
quarter
twenty
years
earlier
the
means
of
resistance
must
have
been
far
fewer
and
the
enemy
in
command
of
almost
all
the
lines
of
access
between
the
beleaguered
villages
and
considering
these
things
i
felt
the
sinister
force
of
harmon
phrase
most
of
the
smart
ones
get
but
if
that
were
the
case
how
could
any
combination
of
obstacles
have
hindered
the
flight
of
a
man
like
ethan
frome
during
my
stay
at
starkfield
i
lodged
with
a
widow
colloquially
known
as
ned
hale
hale
father
had
been
the
village
lawyer
of
the
previous
generation
and
lawyer
varnum
house
where
my
landlady
still
lived
with
her
mother
was
the
most
considerable
mansion
in
the
village
it
stood
at
one
end
of
the
main
street
its
classic
portico
and
windows
looking
down
a
flagged
path
between
norway
spruces
to
the
slim
white
steeple
of
the
congregational
church
it
was
clear
that
the
varnum
fortunes
were
at
the
ebb
but
the
two
women
did
what
they
could
to
preserve
a
decent
dignity
and
hale
in
particular
had
a
certain
wan
refinement
not
out
of
keeping
with
her
pale
house
in
the
best
parlour
with
its
black
and
mahogany
weakly
illuminated
by
a
gurgling
carcel
lamp
i
listened
every
evening
to
another
and
more
delicately
shaded
version
of
the
starkfield
chronicle
it
was
not
that
ned
hale
felt
or
affected
any
social
superiority
to
the
people
about
her
it
was
only
that
the
accident
of
a
finer
sensibility
and
a
little
more
education
had
put
just
enough
distance
between
herself
and
her
neighbours
to
enable
her
to
judge
them
with
detachment
she
was
not
unwilling
to
exercise
this
faculty
and
i
had
great
hopes
of
getting
from
her
the
missing
facts
of
ethan
story
or
rather
such
a
key
to
his
character
as
should
the
facts
i
knew
her
mind
was
a
of
innocuous
anecdote
and
any
question
about
her
acquaintances
brought
forth
a
volume
of
detail
but
on
the
subject
of
ethan
frome
i
found
her
unexpectedly
reticent
there
was
no
hint
of
disapproval
in
her
reserve
i
merely
felt
in
her
an
insurmountable
reluctance
to
speak
of
him
or
his
affairs
a
low
yes
i
knew
them
both
it
was
awful
seeming
to
be
the
utmost
concession
that
her
distress
could
make
to
my
curiosity
so
marked
was
the
change
in
her
manner
such
depths
of
sad
initiation
did
it
imply
that
with
some
doubts
as
to
my
delicacy
i
put
the
case
anew
to
my
village
oracle
harmon
gow
but
got
for
my
pains
only
an
uncomprehending
grunt
ruth
varnum
was
always
as
nervous
as
a
rat
and
come
to
think
of
it
she
was
the
first
one
to
see
after
they
was
picked
up
it
happened
right
below
lawyer
varnum
down
at
the
bend
of
the
corbury
road
just
round
about
the
time
that
ruth
got
engaged
to
ned
hale
the
young
folks
was
all
friends
and
i
guess
she
just
ca
bear
to
talk
about
it
had
troubles
enough
of
her
all
the
dwellers
in
starkfield
as
in
more
notable
communities
had
had
troubles
enough
of
their
own
to
make
them
comparatively
indifferent
to
those
of
their
neighbours
and
though
all
conceded
that
ethan
had
been
beyond
the
common
measure
no
one
gave
me
an
explanation
of
the
look
in
his
face
which
as
i
persisted
in
thinking
neither
poverty
nor
physical
suffering
could
have
put
there
nevertheless
i
might
have
contented
myself
with
the
story
pieced
together
from
these
hints
had
it
not
been
for
the
provocation
of
hale
silence
and
a
little
later
for
the
accident
of
personal
contact
with
the
man
on
my
arrival
at
starkfield
denis
eady
the
rich
irish
grocer
who
was
the
proprietor
of
starkfield
nearest
approach
to
a
livery
stable
had
entered
into
an
agreement
to
send
me
over
daily
to
corbury
flats
where
i
had
to
pick
up
my
train
for
the
junction
but
about
the
middle
of
the
winter
eady
horses
fell
ill
of
a
local
epidemic
the
illness
spread
to
the
other
starkfield
stables
and
for
a
day
or
two
i
was
put
to
it
to
find
a
means
of
transport
then
harmon
gow
suggested
that
ethan
bay
was
still
on
his
legs
and
that
his
owner
might
be
glad
to
drive
me
over
i
stared
at
the
suggestion
ethan
frome
but
i
never
even
spoken
to
him
why
on
earth
should
he
put
himself
out
for
me
harmon
answer
surprised
me
still
more
i
do
know
as
he
would
but
i
know
he
would
be
sorry
to
earn
a
i
had
been
told
that
frome
was
poor
and
that
the
and
the
arid
acres
of
his
farm
yielded
scarcely
enough
to
keep
his
household
through
the
winter
but
i
had
not
supposed
him
to
be
in
such
want
as
words
implied
and
i
expressed
my
wonder
well
matters
ai
gone
any
too
well
with
him
harmon
said
when
a
man
been
setting
round
like
a
hulk
for
twenty
years
or
more
seeing
things
that
want
doing
it
eats
inter
him
and
he
loses
his
grit
that
frome
farm
was
always
as
bare
a
milkpan
when
the
cat
been
round
and
you
know
what
one
of
them
old
is
wuth
nowadays
when
ethan
could
sweat
over
both
from
sunup
to
dark
he
kinder
choked
a
living
out
of
but
his
folks
ate
up
most
everything
even
then
and
i
do
see
how
he
makes
out
now
fust
his
father
got
a
kick
out
haying
and
went
soft
in
the
brain
and
gave
away
money
like
bible
texts
afore
he
died
then
his
mother
got
queer
and
dragged
along
for
years
as
weak
as
a
baby
and
his
wife
zeena
she
always
been
the
greatest
hand
at
doctoring
in
the
county
sickness
and
trouble
that
what
had
his
plate
full
up
with
ever
since
the
very
first
the
next
morning
when
i
looked
out
i
saw
the
bay
between
the
varnum
spruces
and
ethan
frome
throwing
back
his
worn
bearskin
made
room
for
me
in
the
sleigh
at
his
side
after
that
for
a
week
he
drove
me
over
every
morning
to
corbury
flats
and
on
my
return
in
the
afternoon
met
me
again
and
carried
me
back
through
the
icy
night
to
starkfield
the
distance
each
way
was
barely
three
miles
but
the
old
bay
pace
was
slow
and
even
with
firm
snow
under
the
runners
we
were
nearly
an
hour
on
the
way
ethan
frome
drove
in
silence
the
reins
loosely
held
in
his
left
hand
his
brown
seamed
profile
under
the
peak
of
the
cap
relieved
against
the
banks
of
snow
like
the
bronze
image
of
a
hero
he
never
turned
his
face
to
mine
or
answered
except
in
monosyllables
the
questions
i
put
or
such
slight
pleasantries
as
i
ventured
he
seemed
a
part
of
the
mute
melancholy
landscape
an
incarnation
of
its
frozen
woe
with
all
that
was
warm
and
sentient
in
him
fast
bound
below
the
surface
but
there
was
nothing
unfriendly
in
his
silence
i
simply
felt
that
he
lived
in
a
depth
of
moral
isolation
too
remote
for
casual
access
and
i
had
the
sense
that
his
loneliness
was
not
merely
the
result
of
his
personal
plight
tragic
as
i
guessed
that
to
be
but
had
in
it
as
harmon
gow
had
hinted
the
profound
accumulated
cold
of
many
starkfield
winters
only
once
or
twice
was
the
distance
between
us
bridged
for
a
moment
and
the
glimpses
thus
gained
confirmed
my
desire
to
know
more
once
i
happened
to
speak
of
an
engineering
job
i
had
been
on
the
previous
year
in
florida
and
of
the
contrast
between
the
winter
landscape
about
us
and
that
in
which
i
had
found
myself
the
year
before
and
to
my
surprise
frome
said
suddenly
yes
i
was
down
there
once
and
for
a
good
while
afterward
i
could
call
up
the
sight
of
it
in
winter
but
now
it
all
snowed
he
said
no
more
and
i
had
to
guess
the
rest
from
the
inflection
of
his
voice
and
his
sharp
relapse
into
silence
another
day
on
getting
into
my
train
at
the
flats
i
missed
a
volume
of
popular
science
i
think
it
was
on
some
recent
discoveries
in
which
i
had
carried
with
me
to
read
on
the
way
i
thought
no
more
about
it
till
i
got
into
the
sleigh
again
that
evening
and
saw
the
book
in
frome
hand
i
found
it
after
you
were
gone
he
said
i
put
the
volume
into
my
pocket
and
we
dropped
back
into
our
usual
silence
but
as
we
began
to
crawl
up
the
long
hill
from
corbury
flats
to
the
starkfield
ridge
i
became
aware
in
the
dusk
that
he
had
turned
his
face
to
mine
there
are
things
in
that
book
that
i
did
know
the
first
word
about
he
said
i
wondered
less
at
his
words
than
at
the
queer
note
of
resentment
in
his
voice
he
was
evidently
surprised
and
slightly
aggrieved
at
his
own
ignorance
does
that
sort
of
thing
interest
you
i
asked
it
used
there
are
one
or
two
rather
new
things
in
the
book
there
have
been
some
big
strides
lately
in
that
particular
line
of
i
waited
a
moment
for
an
answer
that
did
not
come
then
i
said
if
you
like
to
look
the
book
through
i
be
glad
to
leave
it
with
he
hesitated
and
i
had
the
impression
that
he
felt
himself
about
to
yield
to
a
stealing
tide
of
inertia
then
thank
you
i
take
it
he
answered
shortly
i
hoped
that
this
incident
might
set
up
some
more
direct
communication
between
us
frome
was
so
simple
and
straightforward
that
i
was
sure
his
curiosity
about
the
book
was
based
on
a
genuine
interest
in
its
subject
such
tastes
and
acquirements
in
a
man
of
his
condition
made
the
contrast
more
poignant
between
his
outer
situation
and
his
inner
needs
and
i
hoped
that
the
chance
of
giving
expression
to
the
latter
might
at
least
unseal
his
lips
but
something
in
his
past
history
or
in
his
present
way
of
living
had
apparently
driven
him
too
deeply
into
himself
for
any
casual
impulse
to
draw
him
back
to
his
kind
at
our
next
meeting
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
book
and
our
intercourse
seemed
fated
to
remain
as
negative
and
as
if
there
had
been
no
break
in
his
reserve
frome
had
been
driving
me
over
to
the
flats
for
about
a
week
when
one
morning
i
looked
out
of
my
window
into
a
thick
the
height
of
the
white
waves
massed
against
the
and
along
the
wall
of
the
church
showed
that
the
storm
must
have
been
going
on
all
night
and
that
the
drifts
were
likely
to
be
heavy
in
the
open
i
thought
it
probable
that
my
train
would
be
delayed
but
i
had
to
be
at
the
for
an
hour
or
two
that
afternoon
and
i
decided
if
frome
turned
up
to
push
through
to
the
flats
and
wait
there
till
my
train
came
in
i
do
know
why
i
put
it
in
the
conditional
however
for
i
never
doubted
that
frome
would
appear
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
to
be
turned
from
his
business
by
any
commotion
of
the
elements
and
at
the
appointed
hour
his
sleigh
glided
up
through
the
snow
like
a
behind
thickening
veils
of
gauze
i
was
getting
to
know
him
too
well
to
express
either
wonder
or
gratitude
at
his
keeping
his
appointment
but
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
as
i
saw
him
turn
his
horse
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
of
the
corbury
road
the
railroad
blocked
by
a
that
got
stuck
in
a
drift
below
the
flats
he
explained
as
we
jogged
off
into
the
stinging
whiteness
but
look
here
where
are
you
taking
me
then
straight
to
the
junction
by
the
shortest
way
he
answered
pointing
up
school
house
hill
with
his
whip
to
the
junction
in
this
storm
why
it
a
good
ten
miles
the
bay
do
it
if
you
give
him
time
you
said
you
had
some
business
there
this
afternoon
i
see
you
get
he
said
it
so
quietly
that
i
could
only
answer
you
doing
me
the
biggest
kind
of
a
that
all
right
he
rejoined
abreast
of
the
schoolhouse
the
road
forked
and
we
dipped
down
a
lane
to
the
left
between
hemlock
boughs
bent
inward
to
their
trunks
by
the
weight
of
the
snow
i
had
often
walked
that
way
on
sundays
and
knew
that
the
solitary
roof
showing
through
bare
branches
near
the
bottom
of
the
hill
was
that
of
frome
it
looked
exanimate
enough
with
its
idle
wheel
looming
above
the
black
stream
dashed
with
spume
and
its
cluster
of
sheds
sagging
under
their
white
load
frome
did
not
even
turn
his
head
as
we
drove
by
and
still
in
silence
we
began
to
mount
the
next
slope
about
a
mile
farther
on
a
road
i
had
never
travelled
we
came
to
an
orchard
of
starved
writhing
over
a
hillside
among
outcroppings
of
slate
that
nuzzled
up
through
the
snow
like
animals
pushing
out
their
noses
to
breathe
beyond
the
orchard
lay
a
field
or
two
their
boundaries
lost
under
drifts
and
above
the
fields
huddled
against
the
white
immensities
of
land
and
sky
one
of
those
lonely
new
england
that
make
the
landscape
lonelier
that
my
place
said
frome
with
a
sideway
jerk
of
his
lame
elbow
and
in
the
distress
and
oppression
of
the
scene
i
did
not
know
what
to
answer
the
snow
had
ceased
and
a
flash
of
watery
sunlight
exposed
the
house
on
the
slope
above
us
in
all
its
plaintive
ugliness
the
black
wraith
of
a
deciduous
creeper
flapped
from
the
porch
and
the
thin
wooden
walls
under
their
worn
coat
of
paint
seemed
to
shiver
in
the
wind
that
had
risen
with
the
ceasing
of
the
snow
the
house
was
bigger
in
my
father
time
i
had
to
take
down
the
a
while
back
frome
continued
checking
with
a
twitch
of
the
left
rein
the
bay
evident
intention
of
turning
in
through
the
gate
i
saw
then
that
the
unusually
forlorn
and
stunted
look
of
the
house
was
partly
due
to
the
loss
of
what
is
known
in
new
england
as
the
l
that
long
adjunct
usually
built
at
right
angles
to
the
main
house
and
connecting
it
by
way
of
storerooms
and
with
the
and
whether
because
of
its
symbolic
sense
the
image
it
presents
of
a
life
linked
with
the
soil
and
enclosing
in
itself
the
chief
sources
of
warmth
and
nourishment
or
whether
merely
because
of
the
consolatory
thought
that
it
enables
the
dwellers
in
that
harsh
climate
to
get
to
their
morning
work
without
facing
the
weather
it
is
certain
that
the
l
rather
than
the
house
itself
seems
to
be
the
centre
the
actual
of
the
new
england
farm
perhaps
this
connection
of
ideas
which
had
often
occurred
to
me
in
my
rambles
about
starkfield
caused
me
to
hear
a
wistful
note
in
frome
words
and
to
see
in
the
diminished
dwelling
the
image
of
his
own
shrunken
body
we
kinder
here
now
he
added
but
there
was
considerable
passing
before
the
railroad
was
carried
through
to
the
he
roused
the
lagging
bay
with
another
twitch
then
as
if
the
mere
sight
of
the
house
had
let
me
too
deeply
into
his
confidence
for
any
farther
pretence
of
reserve
he
went
on
slowly
i
always
set
down
the
worst
of
mother
trouble
to
that
when
she
got
the
rheumatism
so
bad
she
could
move
around
she
used
to
sit
up
there
and
watch
the
road
by
the
hour
and
one
year
when
they
was
six
months
mending
the
bettsbridge
pike
after
the
floods
and
harmon
gow
had
to
bring
his
stage
round
this
way
she
picked
up
so
that
she
used
to
get
down
to
the
gate
most
days
to
see
him
but
after
the
trains
begun
running
nobody
ever
come
by
here
to
speak
of
and
mother
never
could
get
it
through
her
head
what
had
happened
and
it
preyed
on
her
right
along
till
she
as
we
turned
into
the
corbury
road
the
snow
began
to
fall
again
cutting
off
our
last
glimpse
of
the
house
and
frome
silence
fell
with
it
letting
down
between
us
the
old
veil
of
reticence
this
time
the
wind
did
not
cease
with
the
return
of
the
snow
instead
it
sprang
up
to
a
gale
which
now
and
then
from
a
tattered
sky
flung
pale
sweeps
of
sunlight
over
a
landscape
chaotically
tossed
but
the
bay
was
as
good
as
frome
word
and
we
pushed
on
to
the
junction
through
the
wild
white
scene
in
the
afternoon
the
storm
held
off
and
the
clearness
in
the
west
seemed
to
my
inexperienced
eye
the
pledge
of
a
fair
evening
i
finished
my
business
as
quickly
as
possible
and
we
set
out
for
starkfield
with
a
good
chance
of
getting
there
for
supper
but
at
sunset
the
clouds
gathered
again
bringing
an
earlier
night
and
the
snow
began
to
fall
straight
and
steadily
from
a
sky
without
wind
in
a
soft
universal
diffusion
more
confusing
than
the
gusts
and
eddies
of
the
morning
it
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
the
thickening
darkness
to
be
the
winter
night
itself
descending
on
us
layer
by
layer
the
small
ray
of
frome
lantern
was
soon
lost
in
this
smothering
medium
in
which
even
his
sense
of
direction
and
the
bay
homing
instinct
finally
ceased
to
serve
us
two
or
three
times
some
ghostly
landmark
sprang
up
to
warn
us
that
we
were
astray
and
then
was
sucked
back
into
the
mist
and
when
we
finally
regained
our
road
the
old
horse
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
i
felt
myself
to
blame
for
having
accepted
frome
offer
and
after
a
short
discussion
i
persuaded
him
to
let
me
get
out
of
the
sleigh
and
walk
along
through
the
snow
at
the
bay
side
in
this
way
we
struggled
on
for
another
mile
or
two
and
at
last
reached
a
point
where
frome
peering
into
what
seemed
to
me
formless
night
said
that
my
gate
down
the
last
stretch
had
been
the
hardest
part
of
the
way
the
bitter
cold
and
the
heavy
going
had
nearly
knocked
the
wind
out
of
me
and
i
could
feel
the
horse
side
ticking
like
a
clock
under
my
hand
look
here
frome
i
began
there
no
earthly
use
in
your
going
any
farther
but
he
interrupted
me
nor
you
neither
there
been
about
enough
of
this
for
i
understood
that
he
was
offering
me
a
night
shelter
at
the
farm
and
without
answering
i
turned
into
the
gate
at
his
side
and
followed
him
to
the
barn
where
i
helped
him
to
unharness
and
bed
down
the
tired
horse
when
this
was
done
he
unhooked
the
lantern
from
the
sleigh
stepped
out
again
into
the
night
and
called
to
me
over
his
shoulder
this
far
off
above
us
a
square
of
light
trembled
through
the
screen
of
snow
staggering
along
in
frome
wake
i
floundered
toward
it
and
in
the
darkness
almost
fell
into
one
of
the
deep
drifts
against
the
front
of
the
house
frome
scrambled
up
the
slippery
steps
of
the
porch
digging
a
way
through
the
snow
with
his
heavily
booted
foot
then
he
lifted
his
lantern
found
the
latch
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
i
went
after
him
into
a
low
unlit
passage
at
the
back
of
which
a
staircase
rose
into
obscurity
on
our
right
a
line
of
light
marked
the
door
of
the
room
which
had
sent
its
ray
across
the
night
and
behind
the
door
i
heard
a
woman
voice
droning
querulously
frome
stamped
on
the
worn
to
shake
the
snow
from
his
boots
and
set
down
his
lantern
on
a
kitchen
chair
which
was
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
the
hall
then
he
opened
the
door
come
in
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
the
droning
voice
grew
still
it
was
that
night
that
i
found
the
clue
to
ethan
frome
and
began
to
put
together
this
vision
of
his
story
i
the
village
lay
under
two
feet
of
snow
with
drifts
at
the
windy
corners
in
a
sky
of
iron
the
points
of
the
dipper
hung
like
icicles
and
orion
flashed
his
cold
fires
the
moon
had
set
but
the
night
was
so
transparent
that
the
white
between
the
elms
looked
gray
against
the
snow
clumps
of
bushes
made
black
stains
on
it
and
the
basement
windows
of
the
church
sent
shafts
of
yellow
light
far
across
the
endless
undulations
young
ethan
frome
walked
at
a
quick
pace
along
the
deserted
street
past
the
bank
and
michael
eady
new
brick
store
and
lawyer
varnum
house
with
the
two
black
norway
spruces
at
the
gate
opposite
the
varnum
gate
where
the
road
fell
away
toward
the
corbury
valley
the
church
reared
its
slim
white
steeple
and
narrow
peristyle
as
the
young
man
walked
toward
it
the
upper
windows
drew
a
black
arcade
along
the
side
wall
of
the
building
but
from
the
lower
openings
on
the
side
where
the
ground
sloped
steeply
down
to
the
corbury
road
the
light
shot
its
long
bars
illuminating
many
fresh
furrows
in
the
track
leading
to
the
basement
door
and
showing
under
an
adjoining
shed
a
line
of
sleighs
with
heavily
blanketed
horses
the
night
was
perfectly
still
and
the
air
so
dry
and
pure
that
it
gave
little
sensation
of
cold
the
effect
produced
on
frome
was
rather
of
a
complete
absence
of
atmosphere
as
though
nothing
less
tenuous
than
ether
intervened
between
the
white
earth
under
his
feet
and
the
metallic
dome
overhead
it
like
being
in
an
exhausted
receiver
he
thought
four
or
five
years
earlier
he
had
taken
a
year
course
at
a
technological
college
at
worcester
and
dabbled
in
the
laboratory
with
a
friendly
professor
of
physics
and
the
images
supplied
by
that
experience
still
cropped
up
at
unexpected
moments
through
the
totally
different
associations
of
thought
in
which
he
had
since
been
living
his
father
death
and
the
misfortunes
following
it
had
put
a
premature
end
to
ethan
studies
but
though
they
had
not
gone
far
enough
to
be
of
much
practical
use
they
had
fed
his
fancy
and
made
him
aware
of
huge
cloudy
meanings
behind
the
daily
face
of
things
as
he
strode
along
through
the
snow
the
sense
of
such
meanings
glowed
in
his
brain
and
mingled
with
the
bodily
flush
produced
by
his
sharp
tramp
at
the
end
of
the
village
he
paused
before
the
darkened
front
of
the
church
he
stood
there
a
moment
breathing
quickly
and
looking
up
and
down
the
street
in
which
not
another
figure
moved
the
pitch
of
the
corbury
road
below
lawyer
varnum
spruces
was
the
favourite
of
starkfield
and
on
clear
evenings
the
church
corner
rang
till
late
with
the
shouts
of
the
coasters
but
not
a
sled
darkened
the
whiteness
of
the
long
declivity
the
hush
of
midnight
lay
on
the
village
and
all
its
waking
life
was
gathered
behind
the
church
windows
from
which
strains
of
flowed
with
the
broad
bands
of
yellow
light
the
young
man
skirting
the
side
of
the
building
went
down
the
slope
toward
the
basement
door
to
keep
out
of
range
of
the
revealing
rays
from
within
he
made
a
circuit
through
the
untrodden
snow
and
gradually
approached
the
farther
angle
of
the
basement
wall
thence
still
hugging
the
shadow
he
edged
his
way
cautiously
forward
to
the
nearest
window
holding
back
his
straight
spare
body
and
craning
his
neck
till
he
got
a
glimpse
of
the
room
seen
thus
from
the
pure
and
frosty
darkness
in
which
he
stood
it
seemed
to
be
seething
in
a
mist
of
heat
the
metal
reflectors
of
the
sent
crude
waves
of
light
against
the
whitewashed
walls
and
the
iron
flanks
of
the
stove
at
the
end
of
the
hall
looked
as
though
they
were
heaving
with
volcanic
fires
the
floor
was
thronged
with
girls
and
young
men
down
the
side
wall
facing
the
window
stood
a
row
of
kitchen
chairs
from
which
the
older
women
had
just
risen
by
this
time
the
music
had
stopped
and
the
musicians
a
fiddler
and
the
young
lady
who
played
the
harmonium
on
sundays
were
hastily
refreshing
themselves
at
one
corner
of
the
which
aligned
its
devastated
and
saucers
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
guests
were
preparing
to
leave
and
the
tide
had
already
set
toward
the
passage
where
coats
and
wraps
were
hung
when
a
young
man
with
a
sprightly
foot
and
a
shock
of
black
hair
shot
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
clapped
his
hands
the
signal
took
instant
effect
the
musicians
hurried
to
their
instruments
the
dancers
some
already
for
departure
fell
into
line
down
each
side
of
the
room
the
older
spectators
slipped
back
to
their
chairs
and
the
lively
young
man
after
diving
about
here
and
there
in
the
throng
drew
forth
a
girl
who
had
already
wound
a
fascinator
about
her
head
and
leading
her
up
to
the
end
of
the
floor
whirled
her
down
its
length
to
the
bounding
tune
of
a
virginia
reel
frome
heart
was
beating
fast
he
had
been
straining
for
a
glimpse
of
the
dark
head
under
the
scarf
and
it
vexed
him
that
another
eye
should
have
been
quicker
than
his
the
leader
of
the
reel
who
looked
as
if
he
had
irish
blood
in
his
veins
danced
well
and
his
partner
caught
his
fire
as
she
passed
down
the
line
her
light
figure
swinging
from
hand
to
hand
in
circles
of
increasing
swiftness
the
scarf
flew
off
her
head
and
stood
out
behind
her
shoulders
and
frome
at
each
turn
caught
sight
of
her
laughing
panting
lips
the
cloud
of
dark
hair
about
her
forehead
and
the
dark
eyes
which
seemed
the
only
fixed
points
in
a
maze
of
flying
lines
the
dancers
were
going
faster
and
faster
and
the
musicians
to
keep
up
with
them
belaboured
their
instruments
like
jockeys
lashing
their
mounts
on
the
yet
it
seemed
to
the
young
man
at
the
window
that
the
reel
would
never
end
now
and
then
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
girl
face
to
that
of
her
partner
which
in
the
exhilaration
of
the
dance
had
taken
on
a
look
of
almost
impudent
ownership
denis
eady
was
the
son
of
michael
eady
the
ambitious
irish
grocer
whose
suppleness
and
effrontery
had
given
starkfield
its
first
notion
of
smart
business
methods
and
whose
new
brick
store
testified
to
the
success
of
the
attempt
his
son
seemed
likely
to
follow
in
his
steps
and
was
meanwhile
applying
the
same
arts
to
the
conquest
of
the
starkfield
maidenhood
hitherto
ethan
frome
had
been
content
to
think
him
a
mean
fellow
but
now
he
positively
invited
a
it
was
strange
that
the
girl
did
not
seem
aware
of
it
that
she
could
lift
her
rapt
face
to
her
dancer
and
drop
her
hands
into
his
without
appearing
to
feel
the
offence
of
his
look
and
touch
frome
was
in
the
habit
of
walking
into
starkfield
to
fetch
home
his
wife
cousin
mattie
silver
on
the
rare
evenings
when
some
chance
of
amusement
drew
her
to
the
village
it
was
his
wife
who
had
suggested
when
the
girl
came
to
live
with
them
that
such
opportunities
should
be
put
in
her
way
mattie
silver
came
from
stamford
and
when
she
entered
the
fromes
household
to
act
as
her
cousin
zeena
aid
it
was
thought
best
as
she
came
without
pay
not
to
let
her
feel
too
sharp
a
contrast
between
the
life
she
had
left
and
the
isolation
of
a
starkfield
farm
but
for
this
as
frome
sardonically
reflected
it
would
hardly
have
occurred
to
zeena
to
take
any
thought
for
the
girl
amusement
when
his
wife
first
proposed
that
they
should
give
mattie
an
occasional
evening
out
he
had
inwardly
demurred
at
having
to
do
the
extra
two
miles
to
the
village
and
back
after
his
hard
day
on
the
farm
but
not
long
afterward
he
had
reached
the
point
of
wishing
that
starkfield
might
give
all
its
nights
to
revelry
mattie
silver
had
lived
under
his
roof
for
a
year
and
from
early
morning
till
they
met
at
supper
he
had
frequent
chances
of
seeing
her
but
no
moments
in
her
company
were
comparable
to
those
when
her
arm
in
his
and
her
light
step
flying
to
keep
time
with
his
long
stride
they
walked
back
through
the
night
to
the
farm
he
had
taken
to
the
girl
from
the
first
day
when
he
had
driven
over
to
the
flats
to
meet
her
and
she
had
smiled
and
waved
to
him
from
the
train
crying
out
you
must
be
ethan
as
she
jumped
down
with
her
bundles
while
he
reflected
looking
over
her
slight
person
she
do
look
much
on
housework
but
she
a
fretter
but
it
was
not
only
that
the
coming
to
his
house
of
a
bit
of
hopeful
young
life
was
like
the
lighting
of
a
fire
on
a
cold
hearth
the
girl
was
more
than
the
bright
serviceable
creature
he
had
thought
her
she
had
an
eye
to
see
and
an
ear
to
hear
he
could
show
her
things
and
tell
her
things
and
taste
the
bliss
of
feeling
that
all
he
imparted
left
long
reverberations
and
echoes
he
could
wake
at
will
it
was
during
their
night
walks
back
to
the
farm
that
he
felt
most
intensely
the
sweetness
of
this
communion
he
had
always
been
more
sensitive
than
the
people
about
him
to
the
appeal
of
natural
beauty
his
unfinished
studies
had
given
form
to
this
sensibility
and
even
in
his
unhappiest
moments
field
and
sky
spoke
to
him
with
a
deep
and
powerful
persuasion
but
hitherto
the
emotion
had
remained
in
him
as
a
silent
ache
veiling
with
sadness
the
beauty
that
evoked
it
he
did
not
even
know
whether
any
one
else
in
the
world
felt
as
he
did
or
whether
he
was
the
sole
victim
of
this
mournful
privilege
then
he
learned
that
one
other
spirit
had
trembled
with
the
same
touch
of
wonder
that
at
his
side
living
under
his
roof
and
eating
his
bread
was
a
creature
to
whom
he
could
say
that
orion
down
yonder
the
big
fellow
to
the
right
is
aldebaran
and
the
bunch
of
little
ones
like
bees
swarming
they
the
pleiades
or
whom
he
could
hold
entranced
before
a
ledge
of
granite
thrusting
up
through
the
fern
while
he
unrolled
the
huge
panorama
of
the
ice
age
and
the
long
dim
stretches
of
succeeding
time
the
fact
that
admiration
for
his
learning
mingled
with
mattie
wonder
at
what
he
taught
was
not
the
least
part
of
his
pleasure
and
there
were
other
sensations
less
definable
but
more
exquisite
which
drew
them
together
with
a
shock
of
silent
joy
the
cold
red
of
sunset
behind
winter
hills
the
flight
of
over
slopes
of
golden
stubble
or
the
intensely
blue
shadows
of
hemlocks
on
sunlit
snow
when
she
said
to
him
once
it
looks
just
as
if
it
was
painted
it
seemed
to
ethan
that
the
art
of
definition
could
go
no
farther
and
that
words
had
at
last
been
found
to
utter
his
secret
soul
as
he
stood
in
the
darkness
outside
the
church
these
memories
came
back
with
the
poignancy
of
vanished
things
watching
mattie
whirl
down
the
floor
from
hand
to
hand
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
thought
that
his
dull
talk
interested
her
to
him
who
was
never
gay
but
in
her
presence
her
gaiety
seemed
plain
proof
of
indifference
the
face
she
lifted
to
her
dancers
was
the
same
which
when
she
saw
him
always
looked
like
a
window
that
has
caught
the
sunset
he
even
noticed
two
or
three
gestures
which
in
his
fatuity
he
had
thought
she
kept
for
him
a
way
of
throwing
her
head
back
when
she
was
amused
as
if
to
taste
her
laugh
before
she
let
it
out
and
a
trick
of
sinking
her
lids
slowly
when
anything
charmed
or
moved
her
the
sight
made
him
unhappy
and
his
unhappiness
roused
his
latent
fears
his
wife
had
never
shown
any
jealousy
of
mattie
but
of
late
she
had
grumbled
increasingly
over
the
and
found
oblique
ways
of
attracting
attention
to
the
girl
inefficiency
zeena
had
always
been
what
starkfield
called
sickly
and
frome
had
to
admit
that
if
she
were
as
ailing
as
she
believed
she
needed
the
help
of
a
stronger
arm
than
the
one
which
lay
so
lightly
in
his
during
the
night
walks
to
the
farm
mattie
had
no
natural
turn
for
housekeeping
and
her
training
had
done
nothing
to
remedy
the
defect
she
was
quick
to
learn
but
forgetful
and
dreamy
and
not
disposed
to
take
the
matter
seriously
ethan
had
an
idea
that
if
she
were
to
marry
a
man
she
was
fond
of
the
dormant
instinct
would
wake
and
her
pies
and
biscuits
become
the
pride
of
the
county
but
domesticity
in
the
abstract
did
not
interest
her
at
first
she
was
so
awkward
that
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
her
but
she
laughed
with
him
and
that
made
them
better
friends
he
did
his
best
to
supplement
her
unskilled
efforts
getting
up
earlier
than
usual
to
light
the
kitchen
fire
carrying
in
the
wood
overnight
and
neglecting
the
mill
for
the
farm
that
he
might
help
her
about
the
house
during
the
day
he
even
crept
down
on
saturday
nights
to
scrub
the
kitchen
floor
after
the
women
had
gone
to
bed
and
zeena
one
day
had
surprised
him
at
the
churn
and
had
turned
away
silently
with
one
of
her
queer
looks
of
late
there
had
been
other
signs
of
her
disfavour
as
intangible
but
more
disquieting
one
cold
winter
morning
as
he
dressed
in
the
dark
his
candle
flickering
in
the
draught
of
the
window
he
had
heard
her
speak
from
the
bed
behind
him
the
doctor
do
want
i
should
be
left
without
anybody
to
do
for
me
she
said
in
her
flat
whine
he
had
supposed
her
to
be
asleep
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
had
startled
him
though
she
was
given
to
abrupt
explosions
of
speech
after
long
intervals
of
secretive
silence
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
where
she
lay
indistinctly
outlined
under
the
dark
calico
quilt
her
face
taking
a
grayish
tinge
from
the
whiteness
of
the
pillow
nobody
to
do
for
you
he
repeated
if
you
say
you
ca
afford
a
hired
girl
when
mattie
frome
turned
away
again
and
taking
up
his
razor
stooped
to
catch
the
reflection
of
his
stretched
cheek
in
the
blotched
above
the
why
on
earth
should
mattie
go
well
when
she
gets
married
i
mean
his
wife
drawl
came
from
behind
him
oh
she
never
leave
us
as
long
as
you
needed
her
he
returned
scraping
hard
at
his
chin
i
would
ever
have
it
said
that
i
stood
in
the
way
of
a
poor
girl
like
mattie
marrying
a
smart
fellow
like
denis
eady
zeena
answered
in
a
tone
of
plaintive
ethan
glaring
at
his
face
in
the
glass
threw
his
head
back
to
draw
the
razor
from
ear
to
chin
his
hand
was
steady
but
the
attitude
was
an
excuse
for
not
making
an
immediate
reply
and
the
doctor
do
want
i
should
be
left
without
anybody
zeena
continued
he
wanted
i
should
speak
to
you
about
a
girl
he
heard
about
that
might
come
ethan
laid
down
the
razor
and
straightened
himself
with
a
laugh
denis
eady
if
that
all
i
guess
there
no
such
hurry
to
look
round
for
a
well
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it
said
zeena
obstinately
he
was
getting
into
his
clothes
in
fumbling
haste
all
right
but
i
have
got
the
time
now
i
late
as
it
is
he
returned
holding
his
old
silver
to
the
candle
zeena
apparently
accepting
this
as
final
lay
watching
him
in
silence
while
he
pulled
his
suspenders
over
his
shoulders
and
jerked
his
arms
into
his
coat
but
as
he
went
toward
the
door
she
said
suddenly
and
incisively
i
guess
you
always
late
now
you
shave
every
that
thrust
had
frightened
him
more
than
any
vague
insinuations
about
denis
eady
it
was
a
fact
that
since
mattie
silver
coming
he
had
taken
to
shaving
every
day
but
his
wife
always
seemed
to
be
asleep
when
he
left
her
side
in
the
winter
darkness
and
he
had
stupidly
assumed
that
she
would
not
notice
any
change
in
his
appearance
once
or
twice
in
the
past
he
had
been
faintly
disquieted
by
zenobia
way
of
letting
things
happen
without
seeming
to
remark
them
and
then
weeks
afterward
in
a
casual
phrase
revealing
that
she
had
all
along
taken
her
notes
and
drawn
her
inferences
of
late
however
there
had
been
no
room
in
his
thoughts
for
such
vague
apprehensions
zeena
herself
from
an
oppressive
reality
had
faded
into
an
insubstantial
shade
all
his
life
was
lived
in
the
sight
and
sound
of
mattie
silver
and
he
could
no
longer
conceive
of
its
being
otherwise
but
now
as
he
stood
outside
the
church
and
saw
mattie
spinning
down
the
floor
with
denis
eady
a
throng
of
disregarded
hints
and
menaces
wove
their
cloud
about
his
brain
ii
as
the
dancers
poured
out
of
the
hall
frome
drawing
back
behind
the
projecting
watched
the
segregation
of
the
grotesquely
muffled
groups
in
which
a
moving
lantern
ray
now
and
then
lit
up
a
face
flushed
with
food
and
dancing
the
villagers
being
afoot
were
the
first
to
climb
the
slope
to
the
main
street
while
the
country
neighbours
packed
themselves
more
slowly
into
the
sleighs
under
the
shed
ai
you
riding
mattie
a
woman
voice
called
back
from
the
throng
about
the
shed
and
ethan
heart
gave
a
jump
from
where
he
stood
he
could
not
see
the
persons
coming
out
of
the
hall
till
they
had
advanced
a
few
steps
beyond
the
wooden
sides
of
the
but
through
its
cracks
he
heard
a
clear
voice
answer
mercy
no
not
on
such
a
she
was
there
then
close
to
him
only
a
thin
board
between
in
another
moment
she
would
step
forth
into
the
night
and
his
eyes
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
would
discern
her
as
clearly
as
though
she
stood
in
daylight
a
wave
of
shyness
pulled
him
back
into
the
dark
angle
of
the
wall
and
he
stood
there
in
silence
instead
of
making
his
presence
known
to
her
it
had
been
one
of
the
wonders
of
their
intercourse
that
from
the
first
she
the
quicker
finer
more
expressive
instead
of
crushing
him
by
the
contrast
had
given
him
something
of
her
own
ease
and
freedom
but
now
he
felt
as
heavy
and
loutish
as
in
his
student
days
when
he
had
tried
to
jolly
the
worcester
girls
at
a
picnic
he
hung
back
and
she
came
out
alone
and
paused
within
a
few
yards
of
him
she
was
almost
the
last
to
leave
the
hall
and
she
stood
looking
uncertainly
about
her
as
if
wondering
why
he
did
not
show
himself
then
a
man
figure
approached
coming
so
close
to
her
that
under
their
formless
wrappings
they
seemed
merged
in
one
dim
outline
gentleman
friend
gone
back
on
you
say
matt
that
tough
no
i
would
be
mean
enough
to
tell
the
other
girls
i
ai
as
as
how
frome
hated
his
cheap
banter
but
look
at
here
ai
it
lucky
i
got
the
old
man
cutter
down
there
waiting
for
us
frome
heard
the
girl
voice
gaily
incredulous
what
on
earth
your
father
cutter
doin
down
there
why
waiting
for
me
to
take
a
ride
i
got
the
roan
colt
too
i
kinder
knew
i
want
to
take
a
ride
eady
in
his
triumph
tried
to
put
a
sentimental
note
into
his
bragging
voice
the
girl
seemed
to
waver
and
frome
saw
her
twirl
the
end
of
her
scarf
irresolutely
about
her
fingers
not
for
the
world
would
he
have
made
a
sign
to
her
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
life
hung
on
her
next
gesture
hold
on
a
minute
while
i
unhitch
the
colt
denis
called
to
her
springing
toward
the
shed
she
stood
perfectly
still
looking
after
him
in
an
attitude
of
tranquil
expectancy
torturing
to
the
hidden
watcher
frome
noticed
that
she
no
longer
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
as
though
peering
through
the
night
for
another
figure
she
let
denis
eady
lead
out
the
horse
climb
into
the
cutter
and
fling
back
the
bearskin
to
make
room
for
her
at
his
side
then
with
a
swift
motion
of
flight
she
turned
about
and
darted
up
the
slope
toward
the
front
of
the
church
hope
you
have
a
lovely
ride
she
called
back
to
him
over
her
shoulder
denis
laughed
and
gave
the
horse
a
cut
that
brought
him
quickly
abreast
of
her
retreating
figure
come
along
get
in
quick
it
as
slippery
as
thunder
on
this
turn
he
cried
leaning
over
to
reach
out
a
hand
to
her
she
laughed
back
at
him
i
not
getting
by
this
time
they
had
passed
beyond
frome
earshot
and
he
could
only
follow
the
shadowy
pantomime
of
their
silhouettes
as
they
continued
to
move
along
the
crest
of
the
slope
above
him
he
saw
eady
after
a
moment
jump
from
the
cutter
and
go
toward
the
girl
with
the
reins
over
one
arm
the
other
he
tried
to
slip
through
hers
but
she
eluded
him
nimbly
and
frome
heart
which
had
swung
out
over
a
black
void
trembled
back
to
safety
a
moment
later
he
heard
the
jingle
of
departing
sleigh
bells
and
discerned
a
figure
advancing
alone
toward
the
empty
expanse
of
snow
before
the
church
in
the
black
shade
of
the
varnum
spruces
he
caught
up
with
her
and
she
turned
with
a
quick
oh
think
i
forgotten
you
matt
he
asked
with
sheepish
glee
she
answered
seriously
i
thought
maybe
you
could
come
back
for
could
what
on
earth
could
stop
me
i
knew
zeena
was
feeling
any
too
good
oh
she
in
bed
long
he
paused
a
question
struggling
in
him
then
you
meant
to
walk
home
all
alone
oh
i
ai
afraid
she
laughed
they
stood
together
in
the
gloom
of
the
spruces
an
empty
world
glimmering
about
them
wide
and
grey
under
the
stars
he
brought
his
question
out
if
you
thought
i
had
come
why
did
you
ride
back
with
denis
eady
why
where
were
you
how
did
you
know
i
never
saw
you
her
wonder
and
his
laughter
ran
together
like
spring
rills
in
a
thaw
ethan
had
the
sense
of
having
done
something
arch
and
ingenious
to
prolong
the
effect
he
groped
for
a
dazzling
phrase
and
brought
out
in
a
growl
of
rapture
come
he
slipped
an
arm
through
hers
as
eady
had
done
and
fancied
it
was
faintly
pressed
against
her
side
but
neither
of
them
moved
it
was
so
dark
under
the
spruces
that
he
could
barely
see
the
shape
of
her
head
beside
his
shoulder
he
longed
to
stoop
his
cheek
and
rub
it
against
her
scarf
he
would
have
liked
to
stand
there
with
her
all
night
in
the
blackness
she
moved
forward
a
step
or
two
and
then
paused
again
above
the
dip
of
the
corbury
road
its
icy
slope
scored
by
innumerable
runners
looked
like
a
mirror
scratched
by
travellers
at
an
inn
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
them
coasting
before
the
moon
set
she
said
would
you
like
to
come
in
and
coast
with
them
some
night
he
asked
oh
would
you
ethan
it
would
be
lovely
we
come
if
there
a
she
lingered
pressing
closer
to
his
side
ned
hale
and
ruth
varnum
came
just
as
near
running
into
the
big
elm
at
the
bottom
we
were
all
sure
they
were
her
shiver
ran
down
his
arm
would
it
have
been
too
awful
they
so
happy
oh
ned
ai
much
at
steering
i
guess
i
can
take
you
down
all
right
he
said
disdainfully
he
was
aware
that
he
was
talking
big
like
denis
eady
but
his
reaction
of
joy
had
unsteadied
him
and
the
inflection
with
which
she
had
said
of
the
engaged
couple
they
so
happy
made
the
words
sound
as
if
she
had
been
thinking
of
herself
and
him
the
elm
is
dangerous
though
it
ought
to
be
cut
down
she
insisted
would
you
be
afraid
of
it
with
me
i
told
you
i
ai
the
kind
to
be
afraid
she
tossed
back
almost
indifferently
and
suddenly
she
began
to
walk
on
with
a
rapid
step
these
alterations
of
mood
were
the
despair
and
joy
of
ethan
frome
the
motions
of
her
mind
were
as
incalculable
as
the
flit
of
a
bird
in
the
branches
the
fact
that
he
had
no
right
to
show
his
feelings
and
thus
provoke
the
expression
of
hers
made
him
attach
a
fantastic
importance
to
every
change
in
her
look
and
tone
now
he
thought
she
understood
him
and
feared
now
he
was
sure
she
did
not
and
despaired
the
pressure
of
accumulated
misgivings
sent
the
scale
drooping
toward
despair
and
her
indifference
was
the
more
chilling
after
the
flush
of
joy
into
which
she
had
plunged
him
by
dismissing
denis
eady
he
mounted
school
house
hill
at
her
side
and
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
reached
the
lane
leading
to
the
then
the
need
of
some
definite
assurance
grew
too
strong
for
him
you
have
found
me
right
off
if
you
had
gone
back
to
have
that
last
reel
with
denis
he
brought
out
awkwardly
he
could
not
pronounce
the
name
without
a
stiffening
of
the
muscles
of
his
throat
why
ethan
how
could
i
tell
you
were
there
i
suppose
what
folks
say
is
true
he
jerked
out
at
her
instead
of
answering
she
stopped
short
and
he
felt
in
the
darkness
that
her
face
was
lifted
quickly
to
his
why
what
do
folks
say
it
natural
enough
you
should
be
leaving
us
he
floundered
on
following
his
thought
is
that
what
they
say
she
mocked
back
at
him
then
with
a
sudden
drop
of
her
sweet
treble
you
mean
that
zeena
ai
suited
with
me
any
more
she
faltered
their
arms
had
slipped
apart
and
they
stood
motionless
each
seeking
to
distinguish
the
other
face
i
know
i
ai
anything
like
as
smart
as
i
ought
to
be
she
went
on
while
he
vainly
struggled
for
expression
there
lots
of
things
a
hired
girl
could
do
that
come
awkward
to
me
still
and
i
have
got
much
strength
in
my
arms
but
if
she
only
tell
me
i
try
you
know
she
hardly
ever
says
anything
and
sometimes
i
can
see
she
ai
suited
and
yet
i
do
know
she
turned
on
him
with
a
sudden
flash
of
indignation
you
ought
to
tell
me
ethan
frome
you
ought
to
unless
you
want
me
to
go
too
unless
he
wanted
her
to
go
too
the
cry
was
balm
to
his
raw
wound
the
iron
heavens
seemed
to
melt
and
rain
down
sweetness
again
he
struggled
for
the
word
and
again
his
arm
in
hers
found
only
a
deep
come
they
walked
on
in
silence
through
the
blackness
of
the
lane
where
ethan
sawmill
gloomed
through
the
night
and
out
again
into
the
comparative
clearness
of
the
fields
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hemlock
belt
the
open
country
rolled
away
before
them
grey
and
lonely
under
the
stars
sometimes
their
way
led
them
under
the
shade
of
an
overhanging
bank
or
through
the
thin
obscurity
of
a
clump
of
leafless
trees
here
and
there
a
farmhouse
stood
far
back
among
the
fields
mute
and
cold
as
a
the
night
was
so
still
that
they
heard
the
frozen
snow
crackle
under
their
feet
the
crash
of
a
loaded
branch
falling
far
off
in
the
woods
reverberated
like
a
and
once
a
fox
barked
and
mattie
shrank
closer
to
ethan
and
quickened
her
steps
at
length
they
sighted
the
group
of
larches
at
ethan
gate
and
as
they
drew
near
it
the
sense
that
the
walk
was
over
brought
back
his
words
then
you
do
want
to
leave
us
matt
he
had
to
stoop
his
head
to
catch
her
stifled
whisper
where
i
go
if
i
did
the
answer
sent
a
pang
through
him
but
the
tone
suffused
him
with
joy
he
forgot
what
else
he
had
meant
to
say
and
pressed
her
against
him
so
closely
that
he
seemed
to
feel
her
warmth
in
his
veins
you
ai
crying
are
you
matt
no
of
course
i
not
she
quavered
they
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
passed
under
the
shaded
knoll
where
enclosed
in
a
low
fence
the
frome
slanted
at
crazy
angles
through
the
snow
ethan
looked
at
them
curiously
for
years
that
quiet
company
had
mocked
his
restlessness
his
desire
for
change
and
freedom
we
never
got
away
how
should
you
seemed
to
be
written
on
every
headstone
and
whenever
he
went
in
or
out
of
his
gate
he
thought
with
a
shiver
i
shall
just
go
on
living
here
till
i
join
but
now
all
desire
for
change
had
vanished
and
the
sight
of
the
little
enclosure
gave
him
a
warm
sense
of
continuance
and
stability
i
guess
we
never
let
you
go
matt
he
whispered
as
though
even
the
dead
lovers
once
must
conspire
with
him
to
keep
her
and
brushing
by
the
graves
he
thought
we
always
go
on
living
here
together
and
some
day
she
lie
there
beside
he
let
the
vision
possess
him
as
they
climbed
the
hill
to
the
house
he
was
never
so
happy
with
her
as
when
he
abandoned
himself
to
these
dreams
up
the
slope
mattie
stumbled
against
some
unseen
obstruction
and
clutched
his
sleeve
to
steady
herself
the
wave
of
warmth
that
went
through
him
was
like
the
prolongation
of
his
vision
for
the
first
time
he
stole
his
arm
about
her
and
she
did
not
resist
they
walked
on
as
if
they
were
floating
on
a
summer
stream
zeena
always
went
to
bed
as
soon
as
she
had
had
her
supper
and
the
shutterless
windows
of
the
house
were
dark
a
dead
dangled
from
the
porch
like
the
crape
streamer
tied
to
the
door
for
a
death
and
the
thought
flashed
through
ethan
brain
if
it
was
there
for
zeena
then
he
had
a
distinct
sight
of
his
wife
lying
in
their
bedroom
asleep
her
mouth
slightly
open
her
false
teeth
in
a
tumbler
by
the
bed
they
walked
around
to
the
back
of
the
house
between
the
rigid
gooseberry
bushes
it
was
zeena
habit
when
they
came
back
late
from
the
village
to
leave
the
key
of
the
kitchen
door
under
the
mat
ethan
stood
before
the
door
his
head
heavy
with
dreams
his
arm
still
about
mattie
matt
he
began
not
knowing
what
he
meant
to
say
she
slipped
out
of
his
hold
without
speaking
and
he
stooped
down
and
felt
for
the
key
it
not
there
he
said
straightening
himself
with
a
start
they
strained
their
eyes
at
each
other
through
the
icy
darkness
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
before
maybe
she
forgotten
it
mattie
said
in
a
tremulous
whisper
but
both
of
them
knew
that
it
was
not
like
zeena
to
forget
it
might
have
fallen
off
into
the
snow
mattie
continued
after
a
pause
during
which
they
had
stood
intently
listening
it
must
have
been
pushed
off
then
he
rejoined
in
the
same
tone
another
wild
thought
tore
through
him
what
if
tramps
had
been
there
what
if
again
he
listened
fancying
he
heard
a
distant
sound
in
the
house
then
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
and
kneeling
down
passed
its
light
slowly
over
the
rough
edges
of
snow
about
the
doorstep
he
was
still
kneeling
when
his
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
lower
panel
of
the
door
caught
a
faint
ray
beneath
it
who
could
be
stirring
in
that
silent
house
he
heard
a
step
on
the
stairs
and
again
for
an
instant
the
thought
of
tramps
tore
through
him
then
the
door
opened
and
he
saw
his
wife
against
the
dark
background
of
the
kitchen
she
stood
up
tall
and
angular
one
hand
drawing
a
quilted
counterpane
to
her
flat
breast
while
the
other
held
a
lamp
the
light
on
a
level
with
her
chin
drew
out
of
the
darkness
her
puckered
throat
and
the
projecting
wrist
of
the
hand
that
clutched
the
quilt
and
deepened
fantastically
the
hollows
and
prominences
of
her
face
under
its
ring
of
to
ethan
still
in
the
rosy
haze
of
his
hour
with
mattie
the
sight
came
with
the
intense
precision
of
the
last
dream
before
waking
he
felt
as
if
he
had
never
before
known
what
his
wife
looked
like
she
drew
aside
without
speaking
and
mattie
and
ethan
passed
into
the
kitchen
which
had
the
deadly
chill
of
a
vault
after
the
dry
cold
of
the
night
guess
you
forgot
about
us
zeena
ethan
joked
stamping
the
snow
from
his
boots
no
i
just
felt
so
mean
i
could
mattie
came
forward
unwinding
her
wraps
the
colour
of
the
cherry
scarf
in
her
fresh
lips
and
cheeks
i
so
sorry
zeena
is
there
anything
i
can
do
no
there
zeena
turned
away
from
her
you
might
shook
off
that
snow
outside
she
said
to
her
husband
she
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
ahead
of
them
and
pausing
in
the
hall
raised
the
lamp
at
as
if
to
light
them
up
the
stairs
ethan
paused
also
affecting
to
fumble
for
the
peg
on
which
he
hung
his
coat
and
cap
the
doors
of
the
two
bedrooms
faced
each
other
across
the
narrow
upper
landing
and
it
was
peculiarly
repugnant
to
him
that
mattie
should
see
him
follow
zeena
i
guess
i
wo
come
up
yet
awhile
he
said
turning
as
if
to
go
back
to
the
kitchen
zeena
stopped
short
and
looked
at
him
for
the
land
sake
what
you
going
to
do
down
here
i
got
the
mill
accounts
to
go
she
continued
to
stare
at
him
the
flame
of
the
unshaded
lamp
bringing
out
with
microscopic
cruelty
the
fretful
lines
of
her
face
at
this
time
o
night
you
ketch
your
death
the
fire
out
long
without
answering
he
moved
away
toward
the
kitchen
as
he
did
so
his
glance
crossed
mattie
and
he
fancied
that
a
fugitive
warning
gleamed
through
her
lashes
the
next
moment
they
sank
to
her
flushed
cheeks
and
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
ahead
of
zeena
that
so
it
is
powerful
cold
down
here
ethan
assented
and
with
lowered
head
he
went
up
in
his
wife
wake
and
followed
her
across
the
threshold
of
their
room
iii
there
was
some
hauling
to
be
done
at
the
lower
end
of
the
and
ethan
was
out
early
the
next
day
the
winter
morning
was
as
clear
as
crystal
the
sunrise
burned
red
in
a
pure
sky
the
shadows
on
the
rim
of
the
were
darkly
blue
and
beyond
the
white
and
scintillating
fields
patches
of
forest
hung
like
smoke
it
was
in
the
early
morning
stillness
when
his
muscles
were
swinging
to
their
familiar
task
and
his
lungs
expanding
with
long
draughts
of
mountain
air
that
ethan
did
his
clearest
thinking
he
and
zeena
had
not
exchanged
a
word
after
the
door
of
their
room
had
closed
on
them
she
had
measured
out
some
drops
from
a
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
and
after
swallowing
them
and
wrapping
her
head
in
a
piece
of
yellow
flannel
had
lain
down
with
her
face
turned
away
ethan
undressed
hurriedly
and
blew
out
the
light
so
that
he
should
not
see
her
when
he
took
his
place
at
her
side
as
he
lay
there
he
could
hear
mattie
moving
about
in
her
room
and
her
candle
sending
its
small
ray
across
the
landing
drew
a
scarcely
perceptible
line
of
light
under
his
door
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
light
till
it
vanished
then
the
room
grew
perfectly
black
and
not
a
sound
was
audible
but
zeena
asthmatic
breathing
ethan
felt
confusedly
that
there
were
many
things
he
ought
to
think
about
but
through
his
tingling
veins
and
tired
brain
only
one
sensation
throbbed
the
warmth
of
mattie
shoulder
against
his
why
had
he
not
kissed
her
when
he
held
her
there
a
few
hours
earlier
he
would
not
have
asked
himself
the
question
even
a
few
minutes
earlier
when
they
had
stood
alone
outside
the
house
he
would
not
have
dared
to
think
of
kissing
her
but
since
he
had
seen
her
lips
in
the
lamplight
he
felt
that
they
were
his
now
in
the
bright
morning
air
her
face
was
still
before
him
it
was
part
of
the
sun
red
and
of
the
pure
glitter
on
the
snow
how
the
girl
had
changed
since
she
had
come
to
starkfield
he
remembered
what
a
colourless
slip
of
a
thing
she
had
looked
the
day
he
had
met
her
at
the
station
and
all
the
first
winter
how
she
had
shivered
with
cold
when
the
northerly
gales
shook
the
thin
clapboards
and
the
snow
beat
like
hail
against
the
windows
he
had
been
afraid
that
she
would
hate
the
hard
life
the
cold
and
loneliness
but
not
a
sign
of
discontent
escaped
her
zeena
took
the
view
that
mattie
was
bound
to
make
the
best
of
starkfield
since
she
had
any
other
place
to
go
to
but
this
did
not
strike
ethan
as
conclusive
zeena
at
any
rate
did
not
apply
the
principle
in
her
own
case
he
felt
all
the
more
sorry
for
the
girl
because
misfortune
had
in
a
sense
indentured
her
to
them
mattie
silver
was
the
daughter
of
a
cousin
of
zenobia
frome
who
had
inflamed
his
clan
with
mingled
sentiments
of
envy
and
admiration
by
descending
from
the
hills
to
connecticut
where
he
had
married
a
stamford
girl
and
succeeded
to
her
father
thriving
drug
business
unhappily
orin
silver
a
man
of
aims
had
died
too
soon
to
prove
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
his
accounts
revealed
merely
what
the
means
had
been
and
these
were
such
that
it
was
fortunate
for
his
wife
and
daughter
that
his
books
were
examined
only
after
his
impressive
funeral
his
wife
died
of
the
disclosure
and
mattie
at
twenty
was
left
alone
to
make
her
way
on
the
fifty
dollars
obtained
from
the
sale
of
her
piano
for
this
purpose
her
equipment
though
varied
was
inadequate
she
could
trim
a
hat
make
molasses
candy
recite
curfew
shall
not
ring
and
play
the
lost
chord
and
a
from
when
she
tried
to
extend
the
field
of
her
activities
in
the
direction
of
stenography
and
her
health
broke
down
and
six
months
on
her
feet
behind
the
counter
of
a
department
store
did
not
tend
to
restore
it
her
nearest
relations
had
been
induced
to
place
their
savings
in
her
father
hands
and
though
after
his
death
they
ungrudgingly
acquitted
themselves
of
the
christian
duty
of
returning
good
for
evil
by
giving
his
daughter
all
the
advice
at
their
disposal
they
could
hardly
be
expected
to
supplement
it
by
material
aid
but
when
zenobia
doctor
recommended
her
looking
about
for
some
one
to
help
her
with
the
the
clan
instantly
saw
the
chance
of
exacting
a
compensation
from
mattie
zenobia
though
doubtful
of
the
girl
efficiency
was
tempted
by
the
freedom
to
find
fault
without
much
risk
of
losing
her
and
so
mattie
came
to
starkfield
zenobia
was
of
the
silent
kind
but
not
the
less
penetrating
for
that
during
the
first
months
ethan
alternately
burned
with
the
desire
to
see
mattie
defy
her
and
trembled
with
fear
of
the
result
then
the
situation
grew
less
strained
the
pure
air
and
the
long
summer
hours
in
the
open
gave
back
life
and
elasticity
to
mattie
and
zeena
with
more
leisure
to
devote
to
her
complex
ailments
grew
less
watchful
of
the
girl
omissions
so
that
ethan
struggling
on
under
the
burden
of
his
barren
farm
and
failing
could
at
least
imagine
that
peace
reigned
in
his
house
there
was
really
even
now
no
tangible
evidence
to
the
contrary
but
since
the
previous
night
a
vague
dread
had
hung
on
his
it
was
formed
of
zeena
obstinate
silence
of
mattie
sudden
look
of
warning
of
the
memory
of
just
such
fleeting
imperceptible
signs
as
those
which
told
him
on
certain
stainless
mornings
that
before
night
there
would
be
rain
his
dread
was
so
strong
that
he
sought
to
postpone
certainty
the
hauling
was
not
over
till
and
as
the
lumber
was
to
be
delivered
to
andrew
hale
the
starkfield
builder
it
was
really
easier
for
ethan
to
send
jotham
powell
the
hired
man
back
to
the
farm
on
foot
and
drive
the
load
down
to
the
village
himself
he
had
scrambled
up
on
the
logs
and
was
sitting
astride
of
them
close
over
his
shaggy
grays
when
coming
between
him
and
their
streaming
necks
he
had
a
vision
of
the
warning
look
that
mattie
had
given
him
the
night
before
if
there
going
to
be
any
trouble
i
want
to
be
there
was
his
vague
reflection
as
he
threw
to
jotham
the
unexpected
order
to
unhitch
the
team
and
lead
them
back
to
the
barn
it
was
a
slow
trudge
home
through
the
heavy
fields
and
when
the
two
men
entered
the
kitchen
mattie
was
lifting
the
coffee
from
the
stove
and
zeena
was
already
at
the
table
her
husband
stopped
short
at
sight
of
her
instead
of
her
usual
calico
wrapper
and
knitted
shawl
she
wore
her
best
dress
of
brown
merino
and
above
her
thin
strands
of
hair
which
still
preserved
the
tight
undulations
of
the
rose
a
hard
perpendicular
bonnet
as
to
which
ethan
clearest
notion
was
that
he
had
to
pay
five
dollars
for
it
at
the
bettsbridge
emporium
on
the
floor
beside
her
stood
his
old
valise
and
a
bandbox
wrapped
in
newspapers
why
where
are
you
going
zeena
he
exclaimed
i
got
my
shooting
pains
so
bad
that
i
going
over
to
bettsbridge
to
spend
the
night
with
aunt
martha
pierce
and
see
that
new
doctor
she
answered
in
a
tone
as
if
she
had
said
she
was
going
into
the
to
take
a
look
at
the
preserves
or
up
to
the
attic
to
go
over
the
blankets
in
spite
of
her
sedentary
habits
such
abrupt
decisions
were
not
without
precedent
in
zeena
history
twice
or
thrice
before
she
had
suddenly
packed
ethan
valise
and
started
off
to
bettsbridge
or
even
springfield
to
seek
the
advice
of
some
new
doctor
and
her
husband
had
grown
to
dread
these
expeditions
because
of
their
cost
zeena
always
came
back
laden
with
expensive
remedies
and
her
last
visit
to
springfield
had
been
commemorated
by
her
paying
twenty
dollars
for
an
electric
battery
of
which
she
had
never
been
able
to
learn
the
use
but
for
the
moment
his
sense
of
relief
was
so
great
as
to
preclude
all
other
feelings
he
had
now
no
doubt
that
zeena
had
spoken
the
truth
in
saying
the
night
before
that
she
had
sat
up
because
she
felt
too
mean
to
sleep
her
abrupt
resolve
to
seek
medical
advice
showed
that
as
usual
she
was
wholly
absorbed
in
her
health
as
if
expecting
a
protest
she
continued
plaintively
if
you
too
busy
with
the
hauling
i
presume
you
can
let
jotham
powell
drive
me
over
with
the
sorrel
in
time
to
ketch
the
train
at
the
her
husband
hardly
heard
what
she
was
saying
during
the
winter
months
there
was
no
stage
between
starkfield
and
bettsbridge
and
the
trains
which
stopped
at
corbury
flats
were
slow
and
infrequent
a
rapid
calculation
showed
ethan
that
zeena
could
not
be
back
at
the
farm
before
the
following
evening
if
i
supposed
you
made
any
objection
to
jotham
powell
driving
me
over
she
began
again
as
though
his
silence
had
implied
refusal
on
the
brink
of
departure
she
was
always
seized
with
a
flux
of
words
all
i
know
is
she
continued
i
ca
go
on
the
way
i
am
much
longer
the
pains
are
clear
away
down
to
my
ankles
now
or
i
walked
in
to
starkfield
on
my
own
feet
put
you
out
and
asked
michael
eady
to
let
me
ride
over
on
his
wagon
to
the
flats
when
he
sends
to
meet
the
train
that
brings
his
groceries
i
had
two
hours
to
wait
in
the
station
but
i
sooner
done
it
even
with
this
cold
than
to
have
you
say
of
course
jotham
drive
you
over
ethan
roused
himself
to
answer
he
became
suddenly
conscious
that
he
was
looking
at
mattie
while
zeena
talked
to
him
and
with
an
effort
he
turned
his
eyes
to
his
wife
she
sat
opposite
the
window
and
the
pale
light
reflected
from
the
banks
of
snow
made
her
face
look
more
than
usually
drawn
and
bloodless
sharpened
the
three
parallel
creases
between
ear
and
cheek
and
drew
querulous
lines
from
her
thin
nose
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
though
she
was
but
seven
years
her
husband
senior
and
he
was
only
she
was
already
an
old
woman
ethan
tried
to
say
something
befitting
the
occasion
but
there
was
only
one
thought
in
his
mind
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
since
mattie
had
come
to
live
with
them
zeena
was
to
be
away
for
a
night
he
wondered
if
the
girl
were
thinking
of
it
too
he
knew
that
zeena
must
be
wondering
why
he
did
not
offer
to
drive
her
to
the
flats
and
let
jotham
powell
take
the
lumber
to
starkfield
and
at
first
he
could
not
think
of
a
pretext
for
not
doing
so
then
he
said
i
take
you
over
myself
only
i
got
to
collect
the
cash
for
the
as
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
he
regretted
them
not
only
because
they
were
untrue
there
being
no
prospect
of
his
receiving
cash
payment
from
hale
but
also
because
he
knew
from
experience
the
imprudence
of
letting
zeena
think
he
was
in
funds
on
the
eve
of
one
of
her
therapeutic
excursions
at
the
moment
however
his
one
desire
was
to
avoid
the
long
drive
with
her
behind
the
ancient
sorrel
who
never
went
out
of
a
walk
zeena
made
no
reply
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
what
he
had
said
she
had
already
pushed
her
plate
aside
and
was
measuring
out
a
draught
from
a
large
bottle
at
her
elbow
it
ai
done
me
a
speck
of
good
but
i
guess
i
might
as
well
use
it
up
she
remarked
adding
as
she
pushed
the
empty
bottle
toward
mattie
if
you
can
get
the
taste
out
it
do
for
iv
as
soon
as
his
wife
had
driven
off
ethan
took
his
coat
and
cap
from
the
peg
mattie
was
washing
up
the
dishes
humming
one
of
the
dance
tunes
of
the
night
before
he
said
so
long
matt
and
she
answered
gaily
so
long
ethan
and
that
was
all
it
was
warm
and
bright
in
the
kitchen
the
sun
slanted
through
the
south
window
on
the
girl
moving
figure
on
the
cat
dozing
in
a
chair
and
on
the
geraniums
brought
in
from
the
where
ethan
had
planted
them
in
the
summer
to
make
a
garden
for
mattie
he
would
have
liked
to
linger
on
watching
her
tidy
up
and
then
settle
down
to
her
sewing
but
he
wanted
still
more
to
get
the
hauling
done
and
be
back
at
the
farm
before
night
all
the
way
down
to
the
village
he
continued
to
think
of
his
return
to
mattie
the
kitchen
was
a
poor
place
not
spruce
and
shining
as
his
mother
had
kept
it
in
his
boyhood
but
it
was
surprising
what
a
homelike
look
the
mere
fact
of
zeena
absence
gave
it
and
he
pictured
what
it
would
be
like
that
evening
when
he
and
mattie
were
there
after
supper
for
the
first
time
they
would
be
alone
together
indoors
and
they
would
sit
there
one
on
each
side
of
the
stove
like
a
married
couple
he
in
his
stocking
feet
and
smoking
his
pipe
she
laughing
and
talking
in
that
funny
way
she
had
which
was
always
as
new
to
him
as
if
he
had
never
heard
her
before
the
sweetness
of
the
picture
and
the
relief
of
knowing
that
his
fears
of
trouble
with
zeena
were
unfounded
sent
up
his
spirits
with
a
rush
and
he
who
was
usually
so
silent
whistled
and
sang
aloud
as
he
drove
through
the
snowy
fields
there
was
in
him
a
slumbering
spark
of
sociability
which
the
long
starkfield
winters
had
not
yet
extinguished
by
nature
grave
and
inarticulate
he
admired
recklessness
and
gaiety
in
others
and
was
warmed
to
the
marrow
by
friendly
human
intercourse
at
worcester
though
he
had
the
name
of
keeping
to
himself
and
not
being
much
of
a
hand
at
a
good
time
he
had
secretly
gloried
in
being
clapped
on
the
back
and
hailed
as
old
ethe
or
old
stiff
and
the
cessation
of
such
familiarities
had
increased
the
chill
of
his
return
to
starkfield
there
the
silence
had
deepened
about
him
year
by
year
left
alone
after
his
father
accident
to
carry
the
burden
of
farm
and
mill
he
had
had
no
time
for
convivial
loiterings
in
the
village
and
when
his
mother
fell
ill
the
loneliness
of
the
house
grew
more
oppressive
than
that
of
the
fields
his
mother
had
been
a
talker
in
her
day
but
after
her
trouble
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
seldom
heard
though
she
had
not
lost
the
power
of
speech
sometimes
in
the
long
winter
evenings
when
in
desperation
her
son
asked
her
why
she
did
say
something
she
would
lift
a
finger
and
answer
because
i
listening
and
on
stormy
nights
when
the
loud
wind
was
about
the
house
she
would
complain
if
he
spoke
to
her
they
talking
so
out
there
that
i
ca
hear
it
was
only
when
she
drew
toward
her
last
illness
and
his
cousin
zenobia
pierce
came
over
from
the
next
valley
to
help
him
nurse
her
that
human
speech
was
heard
again
in
the
house
after
the
mortal
silence
of
his
long
imprisonment
zeena
volubility
was
music
in
his
ears
he
felt
that
he
might
have
gone
like
his
mother
if
the
sound
of
a
new
voice
had
not
come
to
steady
him
zeena
seemed
to
understand
his
case
at
a
glance
she
laughed
at
him
for
not
knowing
the
simplest
duties
and
told
him
to
go
right
along
out
and
leave
her
to
see
to
things
the
mere
fact
of
obeying
her
orders
of
feeling
free
to
go
about
his
business
again
and
talk
with
other
men
restored
his
shaken
balance
and
magnified
his
sense
of
what
he
owed
her
her
efficiency
shamed
and
dazzled
him
she
seemed
to
possess
by
instinct
all
the
household
wisdom
that
his
long
apprenticeship
had
not
instilled
in
him
when
the
end
came
it
was
she
who
had
to
tell
him
to
hitch
up
and
go
for
the
undertaker
and
she
thought
it
funny
that
he
had
not
settled
beforehand
who
was
to
have
his
mother
clothes
and
the
after
the
funeral
when
he
saw
her
preparing
to
go
away
he
was
seized
with
an
unreasoning
dread
of
being
left
alone
on
the
farm
and
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
asked
her
to
stay
there
with
him
he
had
often
thought
since
that
it
would
not
have
happened
if
his
mother
had
died
in
spring
instead
of
winter
when
they
married
it
was
agreed
that
as
soon
as
he
could
straighten
out
the
difficulties
resulting
from
frome
long
illness
they
would
sell
the
farm
and
and
try
their
luck
in
a
large
town
love
of
nature
did
not
take
the
form
of
a
taste
for
agriculture
he
had
always
wanted
to
be
an
engineer
and
to
live
in
towns
where
there
were
lectures
and
big
libraries
and
fellows
doing
a
slight
engineering
job
in
florida
put
in
his
way
during
his
period
of
study
at
worcester
increased
his
faith
in
his
ability
as
well
as
his
eagerness
to
see
the
world
and
he
felt
sure
that
with
a
smart
wife
like
zeena
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
had
made
himself
a
place
in
it
zeena
native
village
was
slightly
larger
and
nearer
to
the
railway
than
starkfield
and
she
had
let
her
husband
see
from
the
first
that
life
on
an
isolated
farm
was
not
what
she
had
expected
when
she
married
but
purchasers
were
slow
in
coming
and
while
he
waited
for
them
ethan
learned
the
impossibility
of
transplanting
her
she
chose
to
look
down
on
starkfield
but
she
could
not
have
lived
in
a
place
which
looked
down
on
her
even
bettsbridge
or
shadd
falls
would
not
have
been
sufficiently
aware
of
her
and
in
the
greater
cities
which
attracted
ethan
she
would
have
suffered
a
complete
loss
of
identity
and
within
a
year
of
their
marriage
she
developed
the
sickliness
which
had
since
made
her
notable
even
in
a
community
rich
in
pathological
instances
when
she
came
to
take
care
of
his
mother
she
had
seemed
to
ethan
like
the
very
genius
of
health
but
he
soon
saw
that
her
skill
as
a
nurse
had
been
acquired
by
the
absorbed
observation
of
her
own
symptoms
then
she
too
fell
silent
perhaps
it
was
the
inevitable
effect
of
life
on
the
farm
or
perhaps
as
she
sometimes
said
it
was
because
ethan
never
the
charge
was
not
wholly
unfounded
when
she
spoke
it
was
only
to
complain
and
to
complain
of
things
not
in
his
power
to
remedy
and
to
check
a
tendency
to
impatient
retort
he
had
first
formed
the
habit
of
not
answering
her
and
finally
of
thinking
of
other
things
while
she
talked
of
late
however
since
he
had
reasons
for
observing
her
more
closely
her
silence
had
begun
to
trouble
him
he
recalled
his
mother
growing
taciturnity
and
wondered
if
zeena
were
also
turning
women
did
he
knew
zeena
who
had
at
her
fingers
ends
the
pathological
chart
of
the
whole
region
had
cited
many
cases
of
the
kind
while
she
was
nursing
his
mother
and
he
himself
knew
of
certain
lonely
in
the
neighbourhood
where
stricken
creatures
pined
and
of
others
where
sudden
tragedy
had
come
of
their
presence
at
times
looking
at
zeena
shut
face
he
felt
the
chill
of
such
forebodings
at
other
times
her
silence
seemed
deliberately
assumed
to
conceal
intentions
mysterious
conclusions
drawn
from
suspicions
and
resentments
impossible
to
guess
that
supposition
was
even
more
disturbing
than
the
other
and
it
was
the
one
which
had
come
to
him
the
night
before
when
he
had
seen
her
standing
in
the
kitchen
door
now
her
departure
for
bettsbridge
had
once
more
eased
his
mind
and
all
his
thoughts
were
on
the
prospect
of
his
evening
with
mattie
only
one
thing
weighed
on
him
and
that
was
his
having
told
zeena
that
he
was
to
receive
cash
for
the
lumber
he
foresaw
so
clearly
the
consequences
of
this
imprudence
that
with
considerable
reluctance
he
decided
to
ask
andrew
hale
for
a
small
advance
on
his
load
when
ethan
drove
into
hale
yard
the
builder
was
just
getting
out
of
his
sleigh
hello
ethe
he
said
this
comes
andrew
hale
was
a
ruddy
man
with
a
big
gray
moustache
and
a
stubbly
unconstrained
by
a
collar
but
his
scrupulously
clean
shirt
was
always
fastened
by
a
small
diamond
stud
this
display
of
opulence
was
misleading
for
though
he
did
a
fairly
good
business
it
was
known
that
his
easygoing
habits
and
the
demands
of
his
large
family
frequently
kept
him
what
starkfield
called
he
was
an
old
friend
of
ethan
family
and
his
house
one
of
the
few
to
which
zeena
occasionally
went
drawn
there
by
the
fact
that
hale
in
her
youth
had
done
more
doctoring
than
any
other
woman
in
starkfield
and
was
still
a
recognised
authority
on
symptoms
and
treatment
hale
went
up
to
the
grays
and
patted
their
sweating
flanks
well
sir
he
said
you
keep
them
two
as
if
they
was
ethan
set
about
unloading
the
logs
and
when
he
had
finished
his
job
he
pushed
open
the
glazed
door
of
the
shed
which
the
builder
used
as
his
office
hale
sat
with
his
feet
up
on
the
stove
his
back
propped
against
a
battered
desk
strewn
with
papers
the
place
like
the
man
was
warm
genial
and
untidy
sit
right
down
and
thaw
out
he
greeted
ethan
the
latter
did
not
know
how
to
begin
but
at
length
he
managed
to
bring
out
his
request
for
an
advance
of
fifty
dollars
the
blood
rushed
to
his
thin
skin
under
the
sting
of
hale
astonishment
it
was
the
custom
to
pay
at
the
end
of
three
months
and
there
was
no
precedent
between
the
two
men
for
a
cash
settlement
ethan
felt
that
if
he
had
pleaded
an
urgent
need
hale
might
have
made
shift
to
pay
him
but
pride
and
an
instinctive
prudence
kept
him
from
resorting
to
this
argument
after
his
father
death
it
had
taken
time
to
get
his
head
above
water
and
he
did
not
want
andrew
hale
or
any
one
else
in
starkfield
to
think
he
was
going
under
again
besides
he
hated
lying
if
he
wanted
the
money
he
wanted
it
and
it
was
nobody
business
to
ask
why
he
therefore
made
his
demand
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
proud
man
who
will
not
admit
to
himself
that
he
is
stooping
and
he
was
not
much
surprised
at
hale
refusal
the
builder
refused
genially
as
he
did
everything
else
he
treated
the
matter
as
something
in
the
nature
of
a
practical
joke
and
wanted
to
know
if
ethan
meditated
buying
a
grand
piano
or
adding
a
cupolo
to
his
house
offering
in
the
latter
case
to
give
his
services
free
of
cost
ethan
arts
were
soon
exhausted
and
after
an
embarrassed
pause
he
wished
hale
good
day
and
opened
the
door
of
the
office
as
he
passed
out
the
builder
suddenly
called
after
him
see
here
you
ai
in
a
tight
place
are
you
not
a
bit
ethan
pride
retorted
before
his
reason
had
time
to
intervene
well
that
good
because
i
am
a
shade
fact
is
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
give
me
a
little
extra
time
on
that
payment
business
is
pretty
slack
to
begin
with
and
then
i
fixing
up
a
little
house
for
ned
and
ruth
when
they
married
i
glad
to
do
it
for
but
it
his
look
appealed
to
ethan
for
sympathy
the
young
people
like
things
nice
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
it
not
so
long
ago
since
you
fixed
up
your
own
place
for
ethan
left
the
grays
in
hale
stable
and
went
about
some
other
business
in
the
village
as
he
walked
away
the
builder
last
phrase
lingered
in
his
ears
and
he
reflected
grimly
that
his
seven
years
with
zeena
seemed
to
starkfield
not
so
the
afternoon
was
drawing
to
an
end
and
here
and
there
a
lighted
pane
spangled
the
cold
gray
dusk
and
made
the
snow
look
whiter
the
bitter
weather
had
driven
every
one
indoors
and
ethan
had
the
long
rural
street
to
himself
suddenly
he
heard
the
brisk
play
of
and
a
cutter
passed
him
drawn
by
a
horse
ethan
recognised
michael
eady
roan
colt
and
young
denis
eady
in
a
handsome
new
fur
cap
leaned
forward
and
waved
a
greeting
hello
ethe
he
shouted
and
spun
on
the
cutter
was
going
in
the
direction
of
the
frome
farm
and
heart
contracted
as
he
listened
to
the
dwindling
bells
what
more
likely
than
that
denis
eady
had
heard
of
zeena
departure
for
bettsbridge
and
was
profiting
by
the
opportunity
to
spend
an
hour
with
mattie
ethan
was
ashamed
of
the
storm
of
jealousy
in
his
breast
it
seemed
unworthy
of
the
girl
that
his
thoughts
of
her
should
be
so
violent
he
walked
on
to
the
church
corner
and
entered
the
shade
of
the
varnum
spruces
where
he
had
stood
with
her
the
night
before
as
he
passed
into
their
gloom
he
saw
an
indistinct
outline
just
ahead
of
him
at
his
approach
it
melted
for
an
instant
into
two
separate
shapes
and
then
conjoined
again
and
he
heard
a
kiss
and
a
oh
provoked
by
the
discovery
of
his
presence
again
the
outline
hastily
disunited
and
the
varnum
gate
slammed
on
one
half
while
the
other
hurried
on
ahead
of
him
ethan
smiled
at
the
discomfiture
he
had
caused
what
did
it
matter
to
ned
hale
and
ruth
varnum
if
they
were
caught
kissing
each
other
everybody
in
starkfield
knew
they
were
engaged
it
pleased
ethan
to
have
surprised
a
pair
of
lovers
on
the
spot
where
he
and
mattie
had
stood
with
such
a
thirst
for
each
other
in
their
hearts
but
he
felt
a
pang
at
the
thought
that
these
two
need
not
hide
their
happiness
he
fetched
the
grays
from
hale
stable
and
started
on
his
long
climb
back
to
the
farm
the
cold
was
less
sharp
than
earlier
in
the
day
and
a
thick
fleecy
sky
threatened
snow
for
the
morrow
here
and
there
a
star
pricked
through
showing
behind
it
a
deep
well
of
blue
in
an
hour
or
two
the
moon
would
push
over
the
ridge
behind
the
farm
burn
a
rent
in
the
clouds
and
then
be
swallowed
by
them
a
mournful
peace
hung
on
the
fields
as
though
they
felt
the
relaxing
grasp
of
the
cold
and
stretched
themselves
in
their
long
winter
sleep
ethan
ears
were
alert
for
the
jingle
of
but
not
a
sound
broke
the
silence
of
the
lonely
road
as
he
drew
near
the
farm
he
saw
through
the
thin
screen
of
larches
at
the
gate
a
light
twinkling
in
the
house
above
him
she
up
in
her
room
he
said
to
himself
fixing
herself
up
for
supper
and
he
remembered
zeena
sarcastic
stare
when
mattie
on
the
evening
of
her
arrival
had
come
down
to
supper
with
smoothed
hair
and
a
ribbon
at
her
neck
he
passed
by
the
graves
on
the
knoll
and
turned
his
head
to
glance
at
one
of
the
older
headstones
which
had
interested
him
deeply
as
a
boy
because
it
bore
his
name
sacred
to
the
memory
of
ethan
frome
and
endurance
his
wife
who
dwelled
together
in
peace
for
fifty
years
he
used
to
think
that
fifty
years
sounded
like
a
long
time
to
live
together
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
might
pass
in
a
flash
then
with
a
sudden
dart
of
irony
he
wondered
if
when
their
turn
came
the
same
epitaph
would
be
written
over
him
and
zeena
he
opened
the
and
craned
his
head
into
the
obscurity
to
discover
denis
eady
roan
colt
in
the
stall
beside
the
sorrel
but
the
old
horse
was
there
alone
mumbling
his
crib
with
toothless
jaws
and
ethan
whistled
cheerfully
while
he
bedded
down
the
grays
and
shook
an
extra
measure
of
oats
into
their
mangers
his
was
not
a
tuneful
throat
but
harsh
melodies
burst
from
it
as
he
locked
the
barn
and
sprang
up
the
hill
to
the
house
he
reached
the
and
turned
the
but
the
door
did
not
yield
to
his
touch
startled
at
finding
it
locked
he
rattled
the
handle
violently
then
he
reflected
that
mattie
was
alone
and
that
it
was
natural
she
should
barricade
herself
at
nightfall
he
stood
in
the
darkness
expecting
to
hear
her
step
it
did
not
come
and
after
vainly
straining
his
ears
he
called
out
in
a
voice
that
shook
with
joy
hello
matt
silence
answered
but
in
a
minute
or
two
he
caught
a
sound
on
the
stairs
and
saw
a
line
of
light
about
the
as
he
had
seen
it
the
night
before
so
strange
was
the
precision
with
which
the
incidents
of
the
previous
evening
were
repeating
themselves
that
he
half
expected
when
he
heard
the
key
turn
to
see
his
wife
before
him
on
the
threshold
but
the
door
opened
and
mattie
faced
him
she
stood
just
as
zeena
had
stood
a
lifted
lamp
in
her
hand
against
the
black
background
of
the
kitchen
she
held
the
light
at
the
same
level
and
it
drew
out
with
the
same
distinctness
her
slim
young
throat
and
the
brown
wrist
no
bigger
than
a
child
then
striking
upward
it
threw
a
lustrous
fleck
on
her
lips
edged
her
eyes
with
velvet
shade
and
laid
a
milky
whiteness
above
the
black
curve
of
her
brows
she
wore
her
usual
dress
of
darkish
stuff
and
there
was
no
bow
at
her
neck
but
through
her
hair
she
had
run
a
streak
of
crimson
ribbon
this
tribute
to
the
unusual
transformed
and
glorified
her
she
seemed
to
ethan
taller
fuller
more
womanly
in
shape
and
motion
she
stood
aside
smiling
silently
while
he
entered
and
then
moved
away
from
him
with
something
soft
and
flowing
in
her
gait
she
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
he
saw
that
it
was
carefully
laid
for
supper
with
fresh
stewed
blueberries
and
his
favourite
pickles
in
a
dish
of
gay
red
glass
a
bright
fire
glowed
in
the
stove
and
the
cat
lay
stretched
before
it
watching
the
table
with
a
drowsy
eye
ethan
was
suffocated
with
the
sense
of
he
went
out
into
the
passage
to
hang
up
his
coat
and
pull
off
his
wet
boots
when
he
came
back
mattie
had
set
the
teapot
on
the
table
and
the
cat
was
rubbing
itself
persuasively
against
her
ankles
why
puss
i
nearly
tripped
over
you
she
cried
the
laughter
sparkling
through
her
lashes
again
ethan
felt
a
sudden
twinge
of
jealousy
could
it
be
his
coming
that
gave
her
such
a
kindled
face
well
matt
any
visitors
he
threw
off
stooping
down
carelessly
to
examine
the
fastening
of
the
stove
she
nodded
and
laughed
yes
one
and
he
felt
a
blackness
settling
on
his
brows
who
was
that
he
questioned
raising
himself
up
to
slant
a
glance
at
her
beneath
his
scowl
her
eyes
danced
with
malice
why
jotham
powell
he
came
in
after
he
got
back
and
asked
for
a
drop
of
coffee
before
he
went
down
the
blackness
lifted
and
light
flooded
ethan
brain
that
all
well
i
hope
you
made
out
to
let
him
have
and
after
a
pause
he
felt
it
right
to
add
i
suppose
he
got
zeena
over
to
the
flats
all
right
oh
yes
in
plenty
of
the
name
threw
a
chill
between
them
and
they
stood
a
moment
looking
sideways
at
each
other
before
mattie
said
with
a
shy
laugh
i
guess
it
about
time
for
they
drew
their
seats
up
to
the
table
and
the
cat
unbidden
jumped
between
them
into
zeena
empty
chair
oh
puss
said
mattie
and
they
laughed
again
ethan
a
moment
earlier
had
felt
himself
on
the
brink
of
eloquence
but
the
mention
of
zeena
had
paralysed
him
mattie
seemed
to
feel
the
contagion
of
his
embarrassment
and
sat
with
downcast
lids
sipping
her
tea
while
he
feigned
an
insatiable
appetite
for
and
sweet
pickles
at
last
after
casting
about
for
an
effective
opening
he
took
a
long
gulp
of
tea
cleared
his
throat
and
said
looks
as
if
be
more
she
feigned
great
interest
is
that
so
do
you
suppose
it
interfere
with
zeena
getting
back
she
flushed
red
as
the
question
escaped
her
and
hastily
set
down
the
cup
she
was
lifting
ethan
reached
over
for
another
helping
of
pickles
you
never
can
tell
this
time
of
year
it
drifts
so
bad
on
the
the
name
had
benumbed
him
again
and
once
more
he
felt
as
if
zeena
were
in
the
room
between
them
oh
puss
you
too
greedy
mattie
cried
the
cat
unnoticed
had
crept
up
on
muffled
paws
from
zeena
seat
to
the
table
and
was
stealthily
elongating
its
body
in
the
direction
of
the
which
stood
between
ethan
and
mattie
the
two
leaned
forward
at
the
same
moment
and
their
hands
met
on
the
handle
of
the
jug
mattie
hand
was
underneath
and
ethan
kept
his
clasped
on
it
a
moment
longer
than
was
necessary
the
cat
profiting
by
this
unusual
demonstration
tried
to
effect
an
unnoticed
retreat
and
in
doing
so
backed
into
the
which
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
mattie
in
an
instant
had
sprung
from
her
chair
and
was
down
on
her
knees
by
the
fragments
oh
ethan
ethan
it
all
to
pieces
what
will
zeena
say
but
this
time
his
courage
was
up
well
she
have
to
say
it
to
the
cat
any
way
he
rejoined
with
a
laugh
kneeling
down
at
mattie
side
to
scrape
up
the
swimming
pickles
she
lifted
stricken
eyes
to
him
yes
but
you
see
she
never
meant
it
should
be
used
not
even
when
there
was
company
and
i
had
to
get
up
on
the
to
reach
it
down
from
the
top
shelf
of
the
where
she
keeps
it
with
all
her
best
things
and
of
course
she
want
to
know
why
i
did
it
the
case
was
so
serious
that
it
called
forth
all
of
ethan
latent
resolution
she
need
know
anything
about
it
if
you
keep
quiet
i
get
another
just
like
it
where
did
it
come
from
i
go
to
shadd
falls
for
it
if
i
have
to
oh
you
never
get
another
even
there
it
was
a
wedding
present
you
remember
it
came
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
from
zeena
aunt
that
married
the
minister
that
why
she
would
ever
use
it
oh
ethan
ethan
what
in
the
world
shall
i
do
she
began
to
cry
and
he
felt
as
if
every
one
of
her
tears
were
pouring
over
him
like
burning
lead
do
matt
do
oh
do
he
implored
her
she
struggled
to
her
feet
and
he
rose
and
followed
her
helplessly
while
she
spread
out
the
pieces
of
glass
on
the
kitchen
dresser
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
shattered
fragments
of
their
evening
lay
there
here
give
them
to
me
he
said
in
a
voice
of
sudden
authority
she
drew
aside
instinctively
obeying
his
tone
oh
ethan
what
are
you
going
to
do
without
replying
he
gathered
the
pieces
of
glass
into
his
broad
palm
and
walked
out
of
the
kitchen
to
the
passage
there
he
lit
a
opened
the
and
reaching
his
long
arm
up
to
the
highest
shelf
laid
the
pieces
together
with
such
accuracy
of
touch
that
a
close
inspection
convinced
him
of
the
impossibility
of
detecting
from
below
that
the
dish
was
broken
if
he
glued
it
together
the
next
morning
months
might
elapse
before
his
wife
noticed
what
had
happened
and
meanwhile
he
might
after
all
be
able
to
match
the
dish
at
shadd
falls
or
bettsbridge
having
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
no
risk
of
immediate
discovery
he
went
back
to
the
kitchen
with
a
lighter
step
and
found
mattie
disconsolately
removing
the
last
scraps
of
pickle
from
the
floor
it
all
right
matt
come
back
and
finish
supper
he
commanded
her
completely
reassured
she
shone
on
him
through
lashes
and
his
soul
swelled
with
pride
as
he
saw
how
his
tone
subdued
her
she
did
not
even
ask
what
he
had
done
except
when
he
was
steering
a
big
log
down
the
mountain
to
his
mill
he
had
never
known
such
a
thrilling
sense
of
mastery
v
they
finished
supper
and
while
mattie
cleared
the
table
ethan
went
to
look
at
the
cows
and
then
took
a
last
turn
about
the
house
the
earth
lay
dark
under
a
muffled
sky
and
the
air
was
so
still
that
now
and
then
he
heard
a
lump
of
snow
come
thumping
down
from
a
tree
far
off
on
the
edge
of
the
when
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
mattie
had
pushed
up
his
chair
to
the
stove
and
seated
herself
near
the
lamp
with
a
bit
of
sewing
the
scene
was
just
as
he
had
dreamed
of
it
that
morning
he
sat
down
drew
his
pipe
from
his
pocket
and
stretched
his
feet
to
the
glow
his
hard
work
in
the
keen
air
made
him
feel
at
once
lazy
and
light
of
mood
and
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
being
in
another
world
where
all
was
warmth
and
harmony
and
time
could
bring
no
change
the
only
drawback
to
his
complete
was
the
fact
that
he
could
not
see
mattie
from
where
he
sat
but
he
was
too
indolent
to
move
and
after
a
moment
he
said
come
over
here
and
sit
by
the
zeena
empty
stood
facing
him
mattie
rose
obediently
and
seated
herself
in
it
as
her
young
brown
head
detached
itself
against
the
cushion
that
habitually
framed
his
wife
gaunt
countenance
ethan
had
a
momentary
shock
it
was
almost
as
if
the
other
face
the
face
of
the
superseded
woman
had
obliterated
that
of
the
intruder
after
a
moment
mattie
seemed
to
be
affected
by
the
same
sense
of
constraint
she
changed
her
position
leaning
forward
to
bend
her
head
above
her
work
so
that
he
saw
only
the
foreshortened
tip
of
her
nose
and
the
streak
of
red
in
her
hair
then
she
slipped
to
her
feet
saying
i
ca
see
to
sew
and
went
back
to
her
chair
by
the
lamp
ethan
made
a
pretext
of
getting
up
to
replenish
the
stove
and
when
he
returned
to
his
seat
he
pushed
it
sideways
that
he
might
get
a
view
of
her
profile
and
of
the
lamplight
falling
on
her
hands
the
cat
who
had
been
a
puzzled
observer
of
these
unusual
movements
jumped
up
into
zeena
chair
rolled
itself
into
a
ball
and
lay
watching
them
with
narrowed
eyes
deep
quiet
sank
on
the
room
the
clock
ticked
above
the
dresser
a
piece
of
charred
wood
fell
now
and
then
in
the
stove
and
the
faint
sharp
scent
of
the
geraniums
mingled
with
the
odour
of
ethan
smoke
which
began
to
throw
a
blue
haze
about
the
lamp
and
to
hang
its
greyish
cobwebs
in
the
shadowy
corners
of
the
room
all
constraint
had
vanished
between
the
two
and
they
began
to
talk
easily
and
simply
they
spoke
of
things
of
the
prospect
of
snow
of
the
next
church
sociable
of
the
loves
and
quarrels
of
starkfield
the
commonplace
nature
of
what
they
said
produced
in
ethan
an
illusion
of
intimacy
which
no
outburst
of
emotion
could
have
given
and
he
set
his
imagination
adrift
on
the
fiction
that
they
had
always
spent
their
evenings
thus
and
would
always
go
on
doing
so
this
is
the
night
we
were
to
have
gone
coasting
matt
he
said
at
length
with
the
rich
sense
as
he
spoke
that
they
could
go
on
any
other
night
they
chose
since
they
had
all
time
before
them
she
smiled
back
at
him
i
guess
you
forgot
no
i
did
forget
but
it
as
dark
as
egypt
outdoors
we
might
go
if
there
a
she
laughed
with
pleasure
her
head
tilted
back
the
lamplight
sparkling
on
her
lips
and
teeth
that
would
be
lovely
ethan
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
marvelling
at
the
way
her
face
changed
with
each
turn
of
their
talk
like
a
under
a
summer
breeze
it
was
intoxicating
to
find
such
magic
in
his
clumsy
words
and
he
longed
to
try
new
ways
of
using
it
would
you
be
scared
to
go
down
the
corbury
road
with
me
on
a
night
like
this
he
asked
her
cheeks
burned
redder
i
ai
any
more
scared
than
you
are
well
i
be
scared
then
i
would
do
it
that
an
ugly
corner
down
by
the
big
elm
if
a
fellow
did
keep
his
eyes
open
he
go
plumb
into
he
luxuriated
in
the
sense
of
protection
and
authority
which
his
words
conveyed
to
prolong
and
intensify
the
feeling
he
added
i
guess
we
well
enough
she
let
her
lids
sink
slowly
in
the
way
he
loved
yes
we
well
enough
here
she
sighed
her
tone
was
so
sweet
that
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
leaning
forward
he
touched
the
farther
end
of
the
strip
of
brown
stuff
that
she
was
hemming
say
matt
he
began
with
a
smile
what
do
you
think
i
saw
under
the
varnum
spruces
coming
along
home
just
now
i
saw
a
friend
of
yours
getting
the
words
had
been
on
his
tongue
all
the
evening
but
now
that
he
had
spoken
them
they
struck
him
as
inexpressibly
vulgar
and
out
of
place
mattie
blushed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
pulled
her
needle
rapidly
twice
or
thrice
through
her
work
insensibly
drawing
the
end
of
it
away
from
him
i
suppose
it
was
ruth
and
ned
she
said
in
a
low
voice
as
though
he
had
suddenly
touched
on
something
grave
ethan
had
imagined
that
his
allusion
might
open
the
way
to
the
accepted
pleasantries
and
these
perhaps
in
turn
to
a
harmless
caress
if
only
a
mere
touch
on
her
hand
but
now
he
felt
as
if
her
blush
had
set
a
flaming
guard
about
her
he
supposed
it
was
his
natural
awkwardness
that
made
him
feel
so
he
knew
that
most
young
men
made
nothing
at
all
of
giving
a
pretty
girl
a
kiss
and
he
remembered
that
the
night
before
when
he
had
put
his
arm
about
mattie
she
had
not
resisted
but
that
had
been
under
the
open
irresponsible
night
now
in
the
warm
lamplit
room
with
all
its
ancient
implications
of
conformity
and
order
she
seemed
infinitely
farther
away
from
him
and
more
unapproachable
to
ease
his
constraint
he
said
i
suppose
they
be
setting
a
date
before
yes
i
should
wonder
if
they
got
married
some
time
along
in
the
she
pronounced
the
word
married
as
if
her
voice
caressed
it
it
seemed
a
rustling
covert
leading
to
enchanted
glades
a
pang
shot
through
ethan
and
he
said
twisting
away
from
her
in
his
chair
be
your
turn
next
i
would
she
laughed
a
little
uncertainly
why
do
you
keep
on
saying
that
he
echoed
her
laugh
i
guess
i
do
it
to
get
used
to
the
he
drew
up
to
the
table
again
and
she
sewed
on
in
silence
with
dropped
lashes
while
he
sat
in
fascinated
contemplation
of
the
way
in
which
her
hands
went
up
and
down
above
the
strip
of
stuff
just
as
he
had
seen
a
pair
of
birds
make
short
perpendicular
flights
over
a
nest
they
were
building
at
length
without
turning
her
head
or
lifting
her
lids
she
said
in
a
low
tone
it
not
because
you
think
zeena
got
anything
against
me
is
it
his
former
dread
started
up
at
the
suggestion
why
what
do
you
mean
he
stammered
she
raised
distressed
eyes
to
his
her
work
dropping
on
the
table
between
them
i
do
know
i
thought
last
night
she
seemed
to
i
like
to
know
what
he
growled
nobody
can
tell
with
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
ever
spoken
so
openly
of
her
attitude
toward
mattie
and
the
repetition
of
the
name
seemed
to
carry
it
to
the
farther
corners
of
the
room
and
send
it
back
to
them
in
long
repercussions
of
sound
mattie
waited
as
if
to
give
the
echo
time
to
drop
and
then
went
on
she
has
said
anything
to
you
he
shook
his
head
no
not
a
she
tossed
the
hair
back
from
her
forehead
with
a
laugh
i
guess
just
nervous
then
i
not
going
to
think
about
it
any
oh
no
do
let
think
about
it
matt
the
sudden
heat
of
his
tone
made
her
colour
mount
again
not
with
a
rush
but
gradually
delicately
like
the
reflection
of
a
thought
stealing
slowly
across
her
heart
she
sat
silent
her
hands
clasped
on
her
work
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
warm
current
flowed
toward
him
along
the
strip
of
stuff
that
still
lay
unrolled
between
them
cautiously
he
slid
his
hand
along
the
table
till
his
touched
the
end
of
the
stuff
a
faint
vibration
of
her
lashes
seemed
to
show
that
she
was
aware
of
his
gesture
and
that
it
had
sent
a
back
to
her
and
she
let
her
hands
lie
motionless
on
the
other
end
of
the
strip
as
they
sat
thus
he
heard
a
sound
behind
him
and
turned
his
head
the
cat
had
jumped
from
zeena
chair
to
dart
at
a
mouse
in
the
wainscot
and
as
a
result
of
the
sudden
movement
the
empty
chair
had
set
up
a
spectral
rocking
she
be
rocking
in
it
herself
this
time
ethan
thought
i
been
in
a
dream
and
this
is
the
only
evening
we
ever
have
the
return
to
reality
was
as
painful
as
the
return
to
consciousness
after
taking
an
anaesthetic
his
body
and
brain
ached
with
indescribable
weariness
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
or
to
do
that
should
arrest
the
mad
flight
of
the
moments
his
alteration
of
mood
seemed
to
have
communicated
itself
to
mattie
she
looked
up
at
him
languidly
as
though
her
lids
were
weighted
with
sleep
and
it
cost
her
an
effort
to
raise
them
her
glance
fell
on
his
hand
which
now
completely
covered
the
end
of
her
work
and
grasped
it
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
herself
he
saw
a
scarcely
perceptible
tremor
cross
her
face
and
without
knowing
what
he
did
he
stooped
his
head
and
kissed
the
bit
of
stuff
in
his
hold
as
his
lips
rested
on
it
he
felt
it
glide
slowly
from
beneath
them
and
saw
that
mattie
had
risen
and
was
silently
rolling
up
her
work
she
fastened
it
with
a
pin
and
then
finding
her
thimble
and
scissors
put
them
with
the
roll
of
stuff
into
the
box
covered
with
fancy
paper
which
he
had
once
brought
to
her
from
bettsbridge
he
stood
up
also
looking
vaguely
about
the
room
the
clock
above
the
dresser
struck
eleven
is
the
fire
all
right
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
he
opened
the
door
of
the
stove
and
poked
aimlessly
at
the
embers
when
he
raised
himself
again
he
saw
that
she
was
dragging
toward
the
stove
the
old
lined
with
carpet
in
which
the
cat
made
its
bed
then
she
recrossed
the
floor
and
lifted
two
of
the
geranium
pots
in
her
arms
moving
them
away
from
the
cold
window
he
followed
her
and
brought
the
other
geraniums
the
hyacinth
bulbs
in
a
cracked
custard
bowl
and
the
german
ivy
trained
over
an
old
croquet
hoop
when
these
nightly
duties
were
performed
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
bring
in
the
tin
candlestick
from
the
passage
light
the
candle
and
blow
out
the
lamp
ethan
put
the
candlestick
in
mattie
hand
and
she
went
out
of
the
kitchen
ahead
of
him
the
light
that
she
carried
before
her
making
her
dark
hair
look
like
a
drift
of
mist
on
the
moon
good
night
matt
he
said
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
stairs
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
good
night
ethan
she
answered
and
went
up
when
the
door
of
her
room
had
closed
on
her
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
even
touched
her
hand
vi
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
jotham
powell
was
between
them
and
ethan
tried
to
hide
his
joy
under
an
air
of
exaggerated
indifference
lounging
back
in
his
chair
to
throw
scraps
to
the
cat
growling
at
the
weather
and
not
so
much
as
offering
to
help
mattie
when
she
rose
to
clear
away
the
dishes
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
so
irrationally
happy
for
nothing
was
changed
in
his
life
or
hers
he
had
not
even
touched
the
tip
of
her
fingers
or
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
but
their
evening
together
had
given
him
a
vision
of
what
life
at
her
side
might
be
and
he
was
glad
now
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
trouble
the
sweetness
of
the
picture
he
had
a
fancy
that
she
knew
what
had
restrained
him
there
was
a
last
load
of
lumber
to
be
hauled
to
the
village
and
jotham
powell
who
did
not
work
regularly
for
ethan
in
winter
had
come
round
to
help
with
the
job
but
a
wet
snow
melting
to
sleet
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
turned
the
roads
to
glass
there
was
more
wet
in
the
air
and
it
seemed
likely
to
both
men
that
the
weather
would
milden
toward
afternoon
and
make
the
going
safer
ethan
therefore
proposed
to
his
assistant
that
they
should
load
the
sledge
at
the
as
they
had
done
on
the
previous
morning
and
put
off
the
teaming
to
starkfield
till
later
in
the
day
this
plan
had
the
advantage
of
enabling
him
to
send
jotham
to
the
flats
after
dinner
to
meet
zenobia
while
he
himself
took
the
lumber
down
to
the
village
he
told
jotham
to
go
out
and
harness
up
the
greys
and
for
a
moment
he
and
mattie
had
the
kitchen
to
themselves
she
had
plunged
the
breakfast
dishes
into
a
tin
and
was
bending
above
it
with
her
slim
arms
bared
to
the
elbow
the
steam
from
the
hot
water
beading
her
forehead
and
tightening
her
rough
hair
into
little
brown
rings
like
the
tendrils
on
the
traveller
joy
ethan
stood
looking
at
her
his
heart
in
his
throat
he
wanted
to
say
we
shall
never
be
alone
again
like
instead
he
reached
down
his
from
a
shelf
of
the
dresser
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
said
i
guess
i
can
make
out
to
be
home
for
she
answered
all
right
ethan
and
he
heard
her
singing
over
the
dishes
as
he
went
as
soon
as
the
sledge
was
loaded
he
meant
to
send
jotham
back
to
the
farm
and
hurry
on
foot
into
the
village
to
buy
the
glue
for
the
with
ordinary
luck
he
should
have
had
time
to
carry
out
this
plan
but
everything
went
wrong
from
the
start
on
the
way
over
to
the
one
of
the
greys
slipped
on
a
glare
of
ice
and
cut
his
knee
and
when
they
got
him
up
again
jotham
had
to
go
back
to
the
barn
for
a
strip
of
rag
to
bind
the
cut
then
when
the
loading
finally
began
a
sleety
rain
was
coming
down
once
more
and
the
tree
trunks
were
so
slippery
that
it
took
twice
as
long
as
usual
to
lift
them
and
get
them
in
place
on
the
sledge
it
was
what
jotham
called
a
sour
morning
for
work
and
the
horses
shivering
and
stamping
under
their
wet
blankets
seemed
to
like
it
as
little
as
the
men
it
was
long
past
the
when
the
job
was
done
and
ethan
had
to
give
up
going
to
the
village
because
he
wanted
to
lead
the
injured
horse
home
and
wash
the
cut
himself
he
thought
that
by
starting
out
again
with
the
lumber
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
dinner
he
might
get
back
to
the
farm
with
the
glue
before
jotham
and
the
old
sorrel
had
had
time
to
fetch
zenobia
from
the
flats
but
he
knew
the
chance
was
a
slight
one
it
turned
on
the
state
of
the
roads
and
on
the
possible
lateness
of
the
bettsbridge
train
he
remembered
afterward
with
a
grim
flash
of
what
importance
he
had
attached
to
the
weighing
of
these
probabilities
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
he
set
out
again
for
the
not
daring
to
linger
till
jotham
powell
left
the
hired
man
was
still
drying
his
wet
feet
at
the
stove
and
ethan
could
only
give
mattie
a
quick
look
as
he
said
beneath
his
breath
i
be
back
he
fancied
that
she
nodded
her
comprehension
and
with
that
scant
solace
he
had
to
trudge
off
through
the
rain
he
had
driven
his
load
to
the
village
when
jotham
powell
overtook
him
urging
the
reluctant
sorrel
toward
the
flats
i
have
to
hurry
up
to
do
it
ethan
mused
as
the
sleigh
dropped
down
ahead
of
him
over
the
dip
of
the
hill
he
worked
like
ten
at
the
unloading
and
when
it
was
over
hastened
on
to
michael
eady
for
the
glue
eady
and
his
assistant
were
both
down
street
and
young
denis
who
seldom
deigned
to
take
their
place
was
lounging
by
the
stove
with
a
knot
of
the
golden
youth
of
starkfield
they
hailed
ethan
with
ironic
compliment
and
offers
of
conviviality
but
no
one
knew
where
to
find
the
glue
ethan
consumed
with
the
longing
for
a
last
moment
alone
with
mattie
hung
about
impatiently
while
denis
made
an
ineffectual
search
in
the
obscurer
corners
of
the
store
looks
as
if
we
were
all
sold
out
but
if
you
wait
around
till
the
old
man
comes
along
maybe
he
can
put
his
hand
on
i
obliged
to
you
but
i
try
if
i
can
get
it
down
at
homan
ethan
answered
burning
to
be
gone
denis
commercial
instinct
compelled
him
to
aver
on
oath
that
what
eady
store
could
not
produce
would
never
be
found
at
the
widow
homan
but
ethan
heedless
of
this
boast
had
already
climbed
to
the
sledge
and
was
driving
on
to
the
rival
establishment
here
after
considerable
search
and
sympathetic
questions
as
to
what
he
wanted
it
for
and
whether
ordinary
flour
paste
would
do
as
well
if
she
could
find
it
the
widow
homan
finally
hunted
down
her
solitary
bottle
of
glue
to
its
in
a
medley
of
and
i
hope
zeena
ai
broken
anything
she
sets
store
by
she
called
after
him
as
he
turned
the
greys
toward
home
the
fitful
bursts
of
sleet
had
changed
into
a
steady
rain
and
the
horses
had
heavy
work
even
without
a
load
behind
them
once
or
twice
hearing
ethan
turned
his
head
fancying
that
zeena
and
jotham
might
overtake
him
but
the
old
sorrel
was
not
in
sight
and
he
set
his
face
against
the
rain
and
urged
on
his
ponderous
pair
the
barn
was
empty
when
the
horses
turned
into
it
and
after
giving
them
the
most
perfunctory
ministrations
they
had
ever
received
from
him
he
strode
up
to
the
house
and
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
mattie
was
there
alone
as
he
had
pictured
her
she
was
bending
over
a
pan
on
the
stove
but
at
the
sound
of
his
step
she
turned
with
a
start
and
sprang
to
him
see
here
matt
i
got
some
stuff
to
mend
the
dish
with
let
me
get
at
it
quick
he
cried
waving
the
bottle
in
one
hand
while
he
put
her
lightly
aside
but
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
oh
ethan
zeena
come
she
said
in
a
whisper
clutching
his
sleeve
they
stood
and
stared
at
each
other
pale
as
culprits
but
the
sorrel
not
in
the
barn
ethan
stammered
jotham
powell
brought
some
goods
over
from
the
flats
for
his
wife
and
he
drove
right
on
home
with
them
she
explained
he
gazed
blankly
about
the
kitchen
which
looked
cold
and
squalid
in
the
rainy
winter
twilight
how
is
she
he
asked
dropping
his
voice
to
mattie
whisper
she
looked
away
from
him
uncertainly
i
do
know
she
went
right
up
to
her
she
did
say
anything
ethan
let
out
his
doubts
in
a
low
whistle
and
thrust
the
bottle
back
into
his
pocket
do
fret
i
come
down
and
mend
it
in
the
night
he
said
he
pulled
on
his
wet
coat
again
and
went
back
to
the
barn
to
feed
the
greys
while
he
was
there
jotham
powell
drove
up
with
the
sleigh
and
when
the
horses
had
been
attended
to
ethan
said
to
him
you
might
as
well
come
back
up
for
a
he
was
not
sorry
to
assure
himself
of
neutralising
presence
at
the
supper
table
for
zeena
was
always
nervous
after
a
journey
but
the
hired
man
though
seldom
loth
to
accept
a
meal
not
included
in
his
wages
opened
his
stiff
jaws
to
answer
slowly
i
obliged
to
you
but
i
guess
i
go
along
ethan
looked
at
him
in
surprise
better
come
up
and
dry
off
looks
as
if
there
be
something
hot
for
jotham
facial
muscles
were
unmoved
by
this
appeal
and
his
vocabulary
being
limited
he
merely
repeated
i
guess
i
go
along
to
ethan
there
was
something
vaguely
ominous
in
this
stolid
rejection
of
free
food
and
warmth
and
he
wondered
what
had
happened
on
the
drive
to
nerve
jotham
to
such
stoicism
perhaps
zeena
had
failed
to
see
the
new
doctor
or
had
not
liked
his
counsels
ethan
knew
that
in
such
cases
the
first
person
she
met
was
likely
to
be
held
responsible
for
her
grievance
when
he
the
kitchen
the
lamp
lit
up
the
same
scene
of
shining
comfort
as
on
the
previous
evening
the
table
had
been
as
carefully
laid
a
clear
fire
glowed
in
the
stove
the
cat
dozed
in
its
warmth
and
mattie
came
forward
carrying
a
plate
of
she
and
ethan
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
then
she
said
as
she
had
said
the
night
before
i
guess
it
about
time
for
vii
ethan
went
out
into
the
passage
to
hang
up
his
wet
garments
he
listened
for
zeena
step
and
not
hearing
it
called
her
name
up
the
stairs
she
did
not
answer
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
went
up
and
opened
her
door
the
room
was
almost
dark
but
in
the
obscurity
he
saw
her
sitting
by
the
window
bolt
upright
and
knew
by
the
rigidity
of
the
outline
projected
against
the
pane
that
she
had
not
taken
off
her
travelling
dress
well
zeena
he
ventured
from
the
threshold
she
did
not
move
and
he
continued
supper
about
ready
ai
you
coming
she
replied
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
touch
a
it
was
the
consecrated
formula
and
he
expected
it
to
be
followed
as
usual
by
her
rising
and
going
down
to
supper
but
she
remained
seated
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
more
felicitous
than
i
presume
tired
after
the
long
turning
her
head
at
this
she
answered
solemnly
i
a
great
deal
sicker
than
you
her
words
fell
on
his
ear
with
a
strange
shock
of
wonder
he
had
often
heard
her
pronounce
them
before
what
if
at
last
they
were
true
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
into
the
dim
room
i
hope
that
not
so
zeena
he
said
she
continued
to
gaze
at
him
through
the
twilight
with
a
mien
of
wan
authority
as
of
one
consciously
singled
out
for
a
great
fate
i
got
complications
she
said
ethan
knew
the
word
for
one
of
exceptional
import
almost
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
had
troubles
frankly
localized
and
specified
but
only
the
chosen
had
to
have
them
was
in
itself
a
distinction
though
it
was
also
in
most
cases
a
people
struggled
on
for
years
with
troubles
but
they
almost
always
succumbed
to
ethan
heart
was
jerking
to
and
fro
between
two
extremities
of
feeling
but
for
the
moment
compassion
prevailed
his
wife
looked
so
hard
and
lonely
sitting
there
in
the
darkness
with
such
thoughts
is
that
what
the
new
doctor
told
you
he
asked
instinctively
lowering
his
voice
yes
he
says
any
regular
doctor
would
want
me
to
have
an
ethan
was
aware
that
in
regard
to
the
important
question
of
surgical
intervention
the
female
opinion
of
the
neighbourhood
was
divided
some
glorying
in
the
prestige
conferred
by
operations
while
others
shunned
them
as
indelicate
ethan
from
motives
of
economy
had
always
been
glad
that
zeena
was
of
the
latter
faction
in
the
agitation
caused
by
the
gravity
of
her
announcement
he
sought
a
consolatory
short
cut
what
do
you
know
about
this
doctor
anyway
nobody
ever
told
you
that
he
saw
his
blunder
before
she
could
take
it
up
she
wanted
sympathy
not
consolation
i
did
need
to
have
anybody
tell
me
i
was
losing
ground
every
day
everybody
but
you
could
see
it
and
everybody
in
bettsbridge
knows
about
buck
he
has
his
office
in
worcester
and
comes
over
once
a
fortnight
to
shadd
falls
and
bettsbridge
for
consultations
eliza
spears
was
wasting
away
with
kidney
trouble
before
she
went
to
him
and
now
she
up
and
around
and
singing
in
the
well
i
glad
of
that
you
must
do
just
what
he
tells
you
ethan
answered
sympathetically
she
was
still
looking
at
him
i
mean
to
she
said
he
was
struck
by
a
new
note
in
her
voice
it
was
neither
whining
nor
reproachful
but
drily
resolute
what
does
he
want
you
should
do
he
asked
with
a
mounting
vision
of
fresh
expenses
he
wants
i
should
have
a
hired
girl
he
says
i
ought
to
have
to
do
a
single
thing
around
the
a
hired
girl
ethan
stood
transfixed
yes
and
aunt
martha
found
me
one
right
off
everybody
said
i
was
lucky
to
get
a
girl
to
come
away
out
here
and
i
agreed
to
give
her
a
dollar
extry
to
make
sure
she
be
over
wrath
and
dismay
contended
in
ethan
he
had
foreseen
an
immediate
demand
for
money
but
not
a
permanent
drain
on
his
scant
resources
he
no
longer
believed
what
zeena
had
told
him
of
the
supposed
seriousness
of
her
state
he
saw
in
her
expedition
to
bettsbridge
only
a
plot
hatched
between
herself
and
her
pierce
relations
to
foist
on
him
the
cost
of
a
servant
and
for
the
moment
wrath
predominated
if
you
meant
to
engage
a
girl
you
ought
to
have
told
me
before
you
started
he
said
how
could
i
tell
you
before
i
started
how
did
i
know
what
buck
would
say
oh
buck
ethan
incredulity
escaped
in
a
short
laugh
did
buck
tell
you
how
i
was
to
pay
her
wages
her
voice
rose
furiously
with
his
no
he
did
for
i
been
ashamed
to
tell
him
that
you
grudged
me
the
money
to
get
back
my
health
when
i
lost
it
nursing
your
own
mother
you
lost
your
health
nursing
mother
yes
and
my
folks
all
told
me
at
the
time
you
could
do
no
less
than
marry
me
after
zeena
through
the
obscurity
which
hid
their
faces
their
thoughts
seemed
to
dart
at
each
other
like
serpents
shooting
venom
ethan
was
seized
with
horror
of
the
scene
and
shame
at
his
own
share
in
it
it
was
as
senseless
and
savage
as
a
physical
fight
between
two
enemies
in
the
darkness
he
turned
to
the
shelf
above
the
chimney
groped
for
matches
and
lit
the
one
candle
in
the
room
at
first
its
weak
flame
made
no
impression
on
the
shadows
then
zeena
face
stood
grimly
out
against
the
uncurtained
pane
which
had
turned
from
grey
to
black
it
was
the
first
scene
of
open
anger
between
the
couple
in
their
sad
seven
years
together
and
ethan
felt
as
if
he
had
lost
an
irretrievable
advantage
in
descending
to
the
level
of
recrimination
but
the
practical
problem
was
there
and
had
to
be
dealt
with
you
know
i
have
got
the
money
to
pay
for
a
girl
zeena
you
have
to
send
her
back
i
ca
do
the
doctor
says
it
be
my
death
if
i
go
on
slaving
the
way
i
had
to
he
does
understand
how
i
stood
it
as
long
as
i
slaving
he
checked
himself
again
you
lift
a
hand
if
he
says
so
i
do
everything
round
the
house
myself
she
broke
in
you
neglecting
the
farm
enough
already
and
this
being
true
he
found
no
answer
and
left
her
time
to
add
ironically
better
send
me
over
to
the
almshouse
and
done
with
it
i
guess
there
been
fromes
there
afore
the
taunt
burned
into
him
but
he
let
it
pass
i
have
got
the
money
that
settles
there
was
a
moment
pause
in
the
struggle
as
though
the
combatants
were
testing
their
weapons
then
zeena
said
in
a
level
voice
i
thought
you
were
to
get
fifty
dollars
from
andrew
hale
for
that
andrew
hale
never
pays
under
three
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
he
remembered
the
excuse
he
had
made
for
not
accompanying
his
wife
to
the
station
the
day
before
and
the
blood
rose
to
his
frowning
brows
why
you
told
me
yesterday
you
fixed
it
up
with
him
to
pay
cash
down
you
said
that
was
why
you
could
drive
me
over
to
the
ethan
had
no
suppleness
in
deceiving
he
had
never
before
been
convicted
of
a
lie
and
all
the
resources
of
evasion
failed
him
i
guess
that
was
a
misunderstanding
he
stammered
you
ai
got
the
money
and
you
ai
going
to
get
it
well
i
could
know
that
when
i
engaged
the
girl
could
i
he
paused
to
control
his
voice
but
you
know
it
now
i
sorry
but
it
ca
be
helped
you
a
poor
man
wife
zeena
but
i
do
the
best
i
can
for
for
a
while
she
sat
motionless
as
if
reflecting
her
arms
stretched
along
the
arms
of
her
chair
her
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
oh
i
guess
we
make
out
she
said
mildly
the
change
in
her
tone
reassured
him
of
course
we
will
there
a
whole
lot
more
i
can
do
for
you
and
mattie
zeena
while
he
spoke
seemed
to
be
following
out
some
elaborate
mental
calculation
she
emerged
from
it
to
say
there
be
mattie
board
less
any
how
ethan
supposing
the
discussion
to
be
over
had
turned
to
go
down
to
supper
he
stopped
short
not
grasping
what
he
heard
mattie
board
less
he
began
zeena
laughed
it
was
on
odd
unfamiliar
sound
he
did
not
remember
ever
having
heard
her
laugh
before
you
did
suppose
i
was
going
to
keep
two
girls
did
you
no
wonder
you
were
scared
at
the
expense
he
still
had
but
a
confused
sense
of
what
she
was
saying
from
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
he
had
instinctively
avoided
the
mention
of
mattie
name
fearing
he
hardly
knew
what
criticism
complaints
or
vague
allusions
to
the
imminent
probability
of
her
marrying
but
the
thought
of
a
definite
rupture
had
never
come
to
him
and
even
now
could
not
lodge
itself
in
his
mind
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
said
mattie
silver
not
a
hired
girl
she
your
she
a
pauper
that
hung
onto
us
all
after
her
father
done
his
best
to
ruin
us
i
kep
her
here
a
whole
year
it
somebody
else
turn
as
the
shrill
words
shot
out
ethan
heard
a
tap
on
the
door
which
he
had
drawn
shut
when
he
turned
back
from
the
threshold
ethan
zeena
mattie
voice
sounded
gaily
from
the
landing
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
supper
been
ready
half
an
inside
the
room
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
zeena
called
out
from
her
seat
i
not
coming
down
to
oh
i
sorry
are
you
well
i
bring
you
up
a
bite
of
something
ethan
roused
himself
with
an
effort
and
opened
the
door
go
along
down
matt
zeena
just
a
little
tired
i
he
heard
her
all
right
and
her
quick
step
on
the
stairs
then
he
shut
the
door
and
turned
back
into
the
room
his
wife
attitude
was
unchanged
her
face
inexorable
and
he
was
seized
with
the
despairing
sense
of
his
helplessness
you
ai
going
to
do
it
zeena
do
what
she
emitted
between
flattened
lips
send
mattie
away
like
this
i
never
bargained
to
take
her
for
life
he
continued
with
rising
vehemence
you
ca
put
her
out
of
the
house
like
a
thief
a
poor
girl
without
friends
or
money
she
done
her
best
for
you
and
she
got
no
place
to
go
to
you
may
forget
she
your
kin
but
everybody
else
remember
it
if
you
do
a
thing
like
that
what
do
you
suppose
folks
say
of
you
zeena
waited
a
moment
as
if
giving
him
time
to
feel
the
full
force
of
the
contrast
between
his
own
excitement
and
her
composure
then
she
replied
in
the
same
smooth
voice
i
know
well
enough
what
they
say
of
my
having
kep
her
here
as
long
as
i
ethan
hand
dropped
from
the
which
he
had
held
clenched
since
he
had
drawn
the
door
shut
on
mattie
his
wife
retort
was
like
a
across
the
sinews
and
he
felt
suddenly
weak
and
powerless
he
had
meant
to
humble
himself
to
argue
that
mattie
keep
did
cost
much
after
all
that
he
could
make
out
to
buy
a
stove
and
fix
up
a
place
in
the
attic
for
the
hired
girl
but
zeena
words
revealed
the
peril
of
such
pleadings
you
mean
to
tell
her
she
got
to
go
at
once
he
faltered
out
in
terror
of
letting
his
wife
complete
her
sentence
as
if
trying
to
make
him
see
reason
she
replied
impartially
the
girl
will
be
over
from
bettsbridge
and
i
presume
she
got
to
have
somewheres
to
ethan
looked
at
her
with
loathing
she
was
no
longer
the
listless
creature
who
had
lived
at
his
side
in
a
state
of
sullen
but
a
mysterious
alien
presence
an
evil
energy
secreted
from
the
long
years
of
silent
brooding
it
was
the
sense
of
his
helplessness
that
sharpened
his
antipathy
there
had
never
been
anything
in
her
that
one
could
appeal
to
but
as
long
as
he
could
ignore
and
command
he
had
remained
indifferent
now
she
had
mastered
him
and
he
abhorred
her
mattie
was
her
relation
not
his
there
were
no
means
by
which
he
could
compel
her
to
keep
the
girl
under
her
roof
all
the
long
misery
of
his
baffled
past
of
his
youth
of
failure
hardship
and
vain
effort
rose
up
in
his
soul
in
bitterness
and
seemed
to
take
shape
before
him
in
the
woman
who
at
every
turn
had
barred
his
way
she
had
taken
everything
else
from
him
and
now
she
meant
to
take
the
one
thing
that
made
up
for
all
the
others
for
a
moment
such
a
flame
of
hate
rose
in
him
that
it
ran
down
his
arm
and
clenched
his
fist
against
her
he
took
a
wild
step
forward
and
then
stopped
you
you
not
coming
down
he
said
in
a
bewildered
voice
no
i
guess
i
lay
down
on
the
bed
a
little
while
she
answered
mildly
and
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
in
the
kitchen
mattie
was
sitting
by
the
stove
the
cat
curled
up
on
her
knees
she
sprang
to
her
feet
as
ethan
entered
and
carried
the
covered
dish
of
to
the
table
i
hope
zeena
is
sick
she
asked
she
shone
at
him
across
the
table
well
sit
right
down
then
you
must
be
she
uncovered
the
pie
and
pushed
it
over
to
him
so
they
were
to
have
one
more
evening
together
her
happy
eyes
seemed
to
say
he
helped
himself
mechanically
and
began
to
eat
then
disgust
took
him
by
the
throat
and
he
laid
down
his
fork
mattie
tender
gaze
was
on
him
and
she
marked
the
gesture
why
ethan
what
the
matter
do
it
taste
right
yes
it
only
i
he
pushed
his
plate
away
rose
from
his
chair
and
walked
around
the
table
to
her
side
she
started
up
with
frightened
eyes
ethan
there
something
wrong
i
knew
there
was
she
seemed
to
melt
against
him
in
her
terror
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
held
her
fast
there
felt
her
lashes
beat
his
cheek
like
netted
butterflies
what
is
it
what
is
it
she
stammered
but
he
had
found
her
lips
at
last
and
was
drinking
unconsciousness
of
everything
but
the
joy
they
gave
him
she
lingered
a
moment
caught
in
the
same
strong
current
then
she
slipped
from
him
and
drew
back
a
step
or
two
pale
and
troubled
her
look
smote
him
with
compunction
and
he
cried
out
as
if
he
saw
her
drowning
in
a
dream
you
ca
go
matt
i
never
let
you
go
go
she
stammered
must
i
go
the
words
went
on
sounding
between
them
as
though
a
torch
of
warning
flew
from
hand
to
hand
through
a
black
landscape
ethan
was
overcome
with
shame
at
his
lack
of
in
flinging
the
news
at
her
so
brutally
his
head
reeled
and
he
had
to
support
himself
against
the
table
all
the
while
he
felt
as
if
he
were
still
kissing
her
and
yet
dying
of
thirst
for
her
lips
ethan
what
has
happened
is
zeena
mad
with
me
her
cry
steadied
him
though
it
deepened
his
wrath
and
pity
no
no
he
assured
her
it
not
that
but
this
new
doctor
has
scared
her
about
herself
you
know
she
believes
all
they
say
the
first
time
she
sees
them
and
this
one
told
her
she
wo
get
well
unless
she
lays
up
and
do
do
a
thing
about
the
house
not
for
months
he
paused
his
eyes
wandering
from
her
miserably
she
stood
silent
a
moment
drooping
before
him
like
a
broken
branch
she
was
so
small
and
that
it
wrung
his
heart
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
straight
at
him
and
she
wants
somebody
handier
in
my
place
is
that
it
that
what
she
says
if
she
says
it
she
say
it
both
bowed
to
the
inexorable
truth
they
knew
that
zeena
never
changed
her
mind
and
that
in
her
case
a
resolve
once
taken
was
equivalent
to
an
act
performed
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
then
mattie
said
in
a
low
voice
do
be
too
sorry
oh
god
oh
god
he
groaned
the
glow
of
passion
he
had
felt
for
her
had
melted
to
an
aching
tenderness
he
saw
her
quick
lids
beating
back
the
tears
and
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
soothe
her
you
letting
your
supper
get
cold
she
admonished
him
with
a
pale
gleam
of
gaiety
oh
matt
matt
where
you
go
to
her
lids
sank
and
a
tremor
crossed
her
face
he
saw
that
for
the
first
time
the
thought
of
the
future
came
to
her
distinctly
i
might
get
something
to
do
over
at
stamford
she
faltered
as
if
knowing
that
he
knew
she
had
no
hope
he
dropped
back
into
his
seat
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
despair
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
her
setting
out
alone
to
renew
the
weary
quest
for
work
in
the
only
place
where
she
was
known
she
was
surrounded
by
indifference
or
animosity
and
what
chance
had
she
inexperienced
and
untrained
among
the
million
of
the
cities
there
came
back
to
him
miserable
tales
he
had
heard
at
worcester
and
the
faces
of
girls
whose
lives
had
begun
as
hopefully
as
mattie
it
was
not
possible
to
think
of
such
things
without
a
revolt
of
his
whole
being
he
sprang
up
suddenly
you
ca
go
matt
i
wo
let
you
she
always
had
her
way
but
i
mean
to
have
mine
now
mattie
lifted
her
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
and
he
heard
his
step
behind
him
zeena
came
into
the
room
with
her
dragging
step
and
quietly
took
her
accustomed
seat
between
them
i
felt
a
little
mite
better
and
buck
says
i
ought
to
eat
all
i
can
to
keep
my
strength
up
even
if
i
ai
got
any
appetite
she
said
in
her
flat
whine
reaching
across
mattie
for
the
teapot
her
good
dress
had
been
replaced
by
the
black
calico
and
brown
knitted
shawl
which
formed
her
daily
wear
and
with
them
she
had
put
on
her
usual
face
and
manner
she
poured
out
her
tea
added
a
great
deal
of
milk
to
it
helped
herself
largely
to
pie
and
pickles
and
made
the
familiar
gesture
of
adjusting
her
false
teeth
before
she
began
to
eat
the
cat
rubbed
itself
ingratiatingly
against
her
and
she
said
good
pussy
stooped
to
stroke
it
and
gave
it
a
scrap
of
meat
from
her
plate
ethan
sat
speechless
not
pretending
to
eat
but
mattie
nibbled
valiantly
at
her
food
and
asked
zeena
one
or
two
questions
about
her
visit
to
bettsbridge
zeena
answered
in
her
tone
and
warming
to
the
theme
regaled
them
with
several
vivid
descriptions
of
intestinal
disturbances
among
her
friends
and
relatives
she
looked
straight
at
mattie
as
she
spoke
a
faint
smile
deepening
the
vertical
lines
between
her
nose
and
chin
when
supper
was
over
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
pressed
her
hand
to
the
flat
surface
over
the
region
of
her
heart
that
pie
of
yours
always
sets
a
mite
heavy
matt
she
said
not
she
seldom
abbreviated
the
girl
name
and
when
she
did
so
it
was
always
a
sign
of
affability
i
a
good
mind
to
go
and
hunt
up
those
stomach
powders
i
got
last
year
over
in
springfield
she
continued
i
ai
tried
them
for
quite
a
while
and
maybe
they
help
the
mattie
lifted
her
eyes
ca
i
get
them
for
you
zeena
she
ventured
no
they
in
a
place
you
do
know
about
zeena
answered
darkly
with
one
of
her
secret
looks
she
went
out
of
the
kitchen
and
mattie
rising
began
to
clear
the
dishes
from
the
table
as
she
passed
ethan
chair
their
eyes
met
and
clung
together
desolately
the
warm
still
kitchen
looked
as
peaceful
as
the
night
before
the
cat
had
sprung
to
zeena
and
the
heat
of
the
fire
was
beginning
to
draw
out
the
faint
sharp
scent
of
the
geraniums
ethan
dragged
himself
wearily
to
his
feet
i
go
out
and
take
a
look
around
he
said
going
toward
the
passage
to
get
his
lantern
as
he
reached
the
door
he
met
zeena
coming
back
into
the
room
her
lips
twitching
with
anger
a
flush
of
excitement
on
her
sallow
face
the
shawl
had
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
was
dragging
at
her
heels
and
in
her
hands
she
carried
the
fragments
of
the
red
glass
i
like
to
know
who
done
this
she
said
looking
sternly
from
ethan
to
mattie
there
was
no
answer
and
she
continued
in
a
trembling
voice
i
went
to
get
those
powders
i
put
away
in
father
old
top
of
the
where
i
keep
the
things
i
set
store
by
so
folks
sha
meddle
with
them
her
voice
broke
and
two
small
tears
hung
on
her
lashless
lids
and
ran
slowly
down
her
cheeks
it
takes
the
stepladder
to
get
at
the
top
shelf
and
i
put
aunt
philura
up
there
o
purpose
when
we
was
married
and
it
never
been
down
since
for
the
spring
cleaning
and
then
i
always
lifted
it
with
my
own
hands
so
it
should
get
she
laid
the
fragments
reverently
on
the
table
i
want
to
know
who
done
this
she
quavered
at
the
challenge
ethan
turned
back
into
the
room
and
faced
her
i
can
tell
you
then
the
cat
done
the
cat
that
what
i
she
looked
at
him
hard
and
then
turned
her
eyes
to
mattie
who
was
carrying
the
to
the
table
i
like
to
know
how
the
cat
got
into
my
she
said
chasin
mice
i
guess
ethan
rejoined
there
was
a
mouse
round
the
kitchen
all
last
zeena
continued
to
look
from
one
to
the
other
then
she
emitted
her
small
strange
laugh
i
knew
the
cat
was
a
smart
cat
she
said
in
a
high
voice
but
i
did
know
he
was
smart
enough
to
pick
up
the
pieces
of
my
and
lay
edge
to
edge
on
the
very
shelf
he
knocked
off
mattie
suddenly
drew
her
arms
out
of
the
steaming
water
it
ethan
fault
zeena
the
cat
did
break
the
dish
but
i
got
it
down
from
the
and
i
the
one
to
blame
for
its
getting
zeena
stood
beside
the
ruin
of
her
treasure
stiffening
into
a
stony
image
of
resentment
you
got
down
my
for
a
bright
flush
flew
to
mattie
cheeks
i
wanted
to
make
the
pretty
she
said
you
wanted
to
make
the
pretty
and
you
waited
till
my
back
was
turned
and
took
the
thing
i
set
most
store
by
of
anything
i
got
and
would
never
use
it
not
even
when
the
minister
come
to
dinner
or
aunt
martha
pierce
come
over
from
bettsbridge
zeena
paused
with
a
gasp
as
if
terrified
by
her
own
evocation
of
the
sacrilege
you
a
bad
girl
mattie
silver
and
i
always
known
it
it
the
way
your
father
begun
and
i
was
warned
of
it
when
i
took
you
and
i
tried
to
keep
my
things
where
you
could
get
at
and
now
you
took
from
me
the
one
i
cared
for
most
of
all
she
broke
off
in
a
short
spasm
of
sobs
that
passed
and
left
her
more
than
ever
like
a
shape
of
stone
if
i
listened
to
folks
you
gone
before
now
and
this
would
happened
she
said
and
gathering
up
the
bits
of
broken
glass
she
went
out
of
the
room
as
if
she
carried
a
dead
body
viii
when
ethan
was
called
back
to
the
farm
by
his
father
illness
his
mother
gave
him
for
his
own
use
a
small
room
behind
the
untenanted
best
here
he
had
nailed
up
shelves
for
his
books
built
himself
a
out
of
boards
and
a
mattress
laid
out
his
papers
on
a
hung
on
the
rough
plaster
wall
an
engraving
of
abraham
lincoln
and
a
calendar
with
thoughts
from
the
poets
and
tried
with
these
meagre
properties
to
produce
some
likeness
to
the
study
of
a
minister
who
had
been
kind
to
him
and
lent
him
books
when
he
was
at
worcester
he
still
took
refuge
there
in
summer
but
when
mattie
came
to
live
at
the
farm
he
had
to
give
her
his
stove
and
consequently
the
room
was
uninhabitable
for
several
months
of
the
year
to
this
retreat
he
descended
as
soon
as
the
house
was
quiet
and
steady
breathing
from
the
bed
had
assured
him
that
there
was
to
be
no
sequel
to
the
scene
in
the
kitchen
after
zeena
departure
he
and
mattie
had
stood
speechless
neither
seeking
to
approach
the
other
then
the
girl
had
returned
to
her
task
of
clearing
up
the
kitchen
for
the
night
and
he
had
taken
his
lantern
and
gone
on
his
usual
round
outside
the
house
the
kitchen
was
empty
when
he
came
back
to
it
but
his
and
pipe
had
been
laid
on
the
table
and
under
them
was
a
scrap
of
paper
torn
from
the
back
of
a
seedsman
catalogue
on
which
three
words
were
written
do
trouble
going
into
his
cold
dark
study
he
placed
the
lantern
on
the
table
and
stooping
to
its
light
read
the
message
again
and
again
it
was
the
first
time
that
mattie
had
ever
written
to
him
and
the
possession
of
the
paper
gave
him
a
strange
new
sense
of
her
nearness
yet
it
deepened
his
anguish
by
reminding
him
that
henceforth
they
would
have
no
other
way
of
communicating
with
each
other
for
the
life
of
her
smile
the
warmth
of
her
voice
only
cold
paper
and
dead
words
confused
motions
of
rebellion
stormed
in
him
he
was
too
young
too
strong
too
full
of
the
sap
of
living
to
submit
so
easily
to
the
destruction
of
his
hopes
must
he
wear
out
all
his
years
at
the
side
of
a
bitter
querulous
woman
other
possibilities
had
been
in
him
possibilities
sacrificed
one
by
one
to
zeena
and
ignorance
and
what
good
had
come
of
it
she
was
a
hundred
times
bitterer
and
more
discontented
than
when
he
had
married
her
the
one
pleasure
left
her
was
to
inflict
pain
on
him
all
the
healthy
instincts
of
rose
up
in
him
against
such
waste
he
bundled
himself
into
his
old
coat
and
lay
down
on
the
to
think
under
his
cheek
he
felt
a
hard
object
with
strange
protuberances
it
was
a
cushion
which
zeena
had
made
for
him
when
they
were
engaged
the
only
piece
of
needlework
he
had
ever
seen
her
do
he
flung
it
across
the
floor
and
propped
his
head
against
the
wall
he
knew
a
case
of
a
man
over
the
mountain
a
young
fellow
of
about
his
own
age
who
had
escaped
from
just
such
a
life
of
misery
by
going
west
with
the
girl
he
cared
for
his
wife
had
divorced
him
and
he
had
married
the
girl
and
prospered
ethan
had
seen
the
couple
the
summer
before
at
shadd
falls
where
they
had
come
to
visit
relatives
they
had
a
little
girl
with
fair
curls
who
wore
a
gold
locket
and
was
dressed
like
a
princess
the
deserted
wife
had
not
done
badly
either
her
husband
had
given
her
the
farm
and
she
had
managed
to
sell
it
and
with
that
and
the
alimony
she
had
started
a
at
bettsbridge
and
bloomed
into
activity
and
importance
ethan
was
fired
by
the
thought
why
should
he
not
leave
with
mattie
the
next
day
instead
of
letting
her
go
alone
he
would
hide
his
valise
under
the
seat
of
the
sleigh
and
zeena
would
suspect
nothing
till
she
went
upstairs
for
her
afternoon
nap
and
found
a
letter
on
the
bed
his
impulses
were
still
near
the
surface
and
he
sprang
up
the
lantern
and
sat
down
at
the
table
he
rummaged
in
the
drawer
for
a
sheet
of
paper
found
one
and
began
to
write
zeena
i
done
all
i
could
for
you
and
i
do
see
as
it
been
any
use
i
do
blame
you
nor
i
do
blame
myself
maybe
both
of
us
will
do
better
separate
i
going
to
try
my
luck
west
and
you
can
sell
the
farm
and
mill
and
keep
the
money
his
pen
paused
on
the
word
which
brought
home
to
him
the
relentless
conditions
of
his
lot
if
he
gave
the
farm
and
mill
to
zeena
what
would
be
left
him
to
start
his
own
life
with
once
in
the
west
he
was
sure
of
picking
up
work
he
would
not
have
feared
to
try
his
chance
alone
but
with
mattie
depending
on
him
the
case
was
different
and
what
of
fate
farm
and
mill
were
mortgaged
to
the
limit
of
their
value
and
even
if
she
found
a
purchaser
in
itself
an
unlikely
chance
it
was
doubtful
if
she
could
clear
a
thousand
dollars
on
the
sale
meanwhile
how
could
she
keep
the
farm
going
it
was
only
by
incessant
labour
and
personal
supervision
that
ethan
drew
a
meagre
living
from
his
land
and
his
wife
even
if
she
were
in
better
health
than
she
imagined
could
never
carry
such
a
burden
alone
well
she
could
go
back
to
her
people
then
and
see
what
they
would
do
for
her
it
was
the
fate
she
was
forcing
on
mattie
why
not
let
her
try
it
herself
by
the
time
she
had
discovered
his
whereabouts
and
brought
suit
for
divorce
he
would
probably
wherever
he
was
be
earning
enough
to
pay
her
a
sufficient
alimony
and
the
alternative
was
to
let
mattie
go
forth
alone
with
far
less
hope
of
ultimate
provision
he
had
scattered
the
contents
of
the
in
his
search
for
a
sheet
of
paper
and
as
he
took
up
his
pen
his
eye
fell
on
an
old
copy
of
the
bettsbridge
eagle
the
advertising
sheet
was
folded
uppermost
and
he
read
the
seductive
words
trips
to
the
west
reduced
he
drew
the
lantern
nearer
and
eagerly
scanned
the
fares
then
the
paper
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
pushed
aside
his
unfinished
letter
a
moment
ago
he
had
wondered
what
he
and
mattie
were
to
live
on
when
they
reached
the
west
now
he
saw
that
he
had
not
even
the
money
to
take
her
there
borrowing
was
out
of
the
question
six
months
before
he
had
given
his
only
security
to
raise
funds
for
necessary
repairs
to
the
mill
and
he
knew
that
without
security
no
one
at
starkfield
would
lend
him
ten
dollars
the
inexorable
facts
closed
in
on
him
like
handcuffing
a
convict
there
was
no
way
out
none
he
was
a
prisoner
for
life
and
now
his
one
ray
of
light
was
to
be
extinguished
he
crept
back
heavily
to
the
sofa
stretching
himself
out
with
limbs
so
leaden
that
he
felt
as
if
they
would
never
move
again
tears
rose
in
his
throat
and
slowly
burned
their
way
to
his
lids
as
he
lay
there
the
that
faced
him
growing
gradually
lighter
inlaid
upon
the
darkness
a
square
of
sky
a
crooked
crossed
it
a
branch
of
the
under
which
on
summer
evenings
he
had
sometimes
found
mattie
sitting
when
he
came
up
from
the
mill
slowly
the
rim
of
the
rainy
vapours
caught
fire
and
burnt
away
and
a
pure
moon
swung
into
the
blue
ethan
rising
on
his
elbow
watched
the
landscape
whiten
and
shape
itself
under
the
sculpture
of
the
moon
this
was
the
night
on
which
he
was
to
have
taken
mattie
coasting
and
there
hung
the
lamp
to
light
them
he
looked
out
at
the
slopes
bathed
in
lustre
the
darkness
of
the
woods
the
spectral
purple
of
the
hills
against
the
sky
and
it
seemed
as
though
all
the
beauty
of
the
night
had
been
poured
out
to
mock
his
wretchedness
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
woke
the
chill
of
the
winter
dawn
was
in
the
room
he
felt
cold
and
stiff
and
hungry
and
ashamed
of
being
hungry
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
went
to
the
window
a
red
sun
stood
over
the
grey
rim
of
the
fields
behind
trees
that
looked
black
and
brittle
he
said
to
himself
this
is
matt
last
day
and
tried
to
think
what
the
place
would
be
without
her
as
he
stood
there
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
she
entered
oh
ethan
were
you
here
all
night
she
looked
so
small
and
pinched
in
her
poor
dress
with
the
red
scarf
wound
about
her
and
the
cold
light
turning
her
paleness
sallow
that
ethan
stood
before
her
without
speaking
you
must
be
frozen
she
went
on
fixing
lustreless
eyes
on
him
he
drew
a
step
nearer
how
did
you
know
i
was
here
because
i
heard
you
go
down
stairs
again
after
i
went
to
bed
and
i
listened
all
night
and
you
did
come
all
his
tenderness
rushed
to
his
lips
he
looked
at
her
and
said
come
right
along
and
make
up
the
kitchen
they
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
he
fetched
the
coal
and
kindlings
and
cleared
out
the
stove
for
her
while
she
brought
in
the
milk
and
the
cold
remains
of
the
when
warmth
began
to
radiate
from
the
stove
and
the
first
ray
of
sunlight
lay
on
the
kitchen
floor
dark
thoughts
melted
in
the
mellower
air
the
sight
of
mattie
going
about
her
work
as
he
had
seen
her
on
so
many
mornings
made
it
seem
impossible
that
she
should
ever
cease
to
be
a
part
of
the
scene
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
doubtless
exaggerated
the
significance
of
threats
and
that
she
too
with
the
return
of
daylight
would
come
to
a
saner
mood
he
went
up
to
mattie
as
she
bent
above
the
stove
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
i
do
want
you
should
trouble
either
he
said
looking
down
into
her
eyes
with
a
smile
she
flushed
up
warmly
and
whispered
back
no
ethan
i
ai
going
to
i
guess
things
straighten
out
he
added
there
was
no
answer
but
a
quick
throb
of
her
lids
and
he
went
on
she
ai
said
anything
this
morning
no
i
have
seen
her
do
you
take
any
notice
when
you
with
this
injunction
he
left
her
and
went
out
to
the
he
saw
jotham
powell
walking
up
the
hill
through
the
morning
mist
and
the
familiar
sight
added
to
his
growing
conviction
of
security
as
the
two
men
were
clearing
out
the
stalls
jotham
rested
on
his
to
say
byrne
goin
over
to
the
flats
noon
an
he
c
take
mattie
trunk
along
and
make
it
easier
ridin
when
i
take
her
over
in
the
ethan
looked
at
him
blankly
and
he
continued
mis
frome
said
the
new
girl
be
at
the
flats
at
five
and
i
was
to
take
mattie
then
so
she
could
ketch
the
six
train
for
ethan
felt
the
blood
drumming
in
his
temples
he
had
to
wait
a
moment
before
he
could
find
voice
to
say
oh
it
ai
so
sure
about
going
that
so
said
jotham
indifferently
and
they
went
on
with
their
work
when
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
the
two
women
were
already
at
breakfast
zeena
had
an
air
of
unusual
alertness
and
activity
she
drank
two
cups
of
coffee
and
fed
the
cat
with
the
scraps
left
in
the
then
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
walking
over
to
the
window
snipped
two
or
three
yellow
leaves
from
the
geraniums
aunt
martha
ai
got
a
faded
leaf
on
but
they
pine
away
when
they
ai
cared
for
she
said
reflectively
then
she
turned
to
jotham
and
asked
what
time
you
say
byrne
be
along
the
hired
man
threw
a
hesitating
glance
at
ethan
round
about
noon
he
said
zeena
turned
to
mattie
that
trunk
of
yours
is
too
heavy
for
the
sleigh
and
byrne
be
round
to
take
it
over
to
the
flats
she
said
i
much
obliged
to
you
zeena
said
mattie
i
like
to
go
over
things
with
you
first
zeena
continued
in
an
unperturbed
voice
i
know
there
a
huckabuck
towel
missing
and
i
ca
make
out
what
you
done
with
that
used
to
stand
behind
the
stuffed
owl
in
the
she
went
out
followed
by
mattie
and
when
the
men
were
alone
jotham
said
to
his
employer
i
guess
i
better
let
come
round
ethan
finished
his
usual
morning
tasks
about
the
house
and
barn
then
he
said
to
jotham
i
going
down
to
starkfield
tell
them
not
to
wait
the
passion
of
rebellion
had
broken
out
in
him
again
that
which
had
seemed
incredible
in
the
sober
light
of
day
had
really
come
to
pass
and
he
was
to
assist
as
a
helpless
spectator
at
mattie
banishment
his
manhood
was
humbled
by
the
part
he
was
compelled
to
play
and
by
the
thought
of
what
mattie
must
think
of
him
confused
impulses
struggled
in
him
as
he
strode
along
to
the
village
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
something
but
he
did
not
know
what
it
would
be
the
early
mist
had
vanished
and
the
fields
lay
like
a
silver
shield
under
the
sun
it
was
one
of
the
days
when
the
glitter
of
winter
shines
through
a
pale
haze
of
spring
every
yard
of
the
road
was
alive
with
mattie
presence
and
there
was
hardly
a
branch
against
the
sky
or
a
tangle
of
brambles
on
the
bank
in
which
some
bright
shred
of
memory
was
not
caught
once
in
the
stillness
the
call
of
a
bird
in
a
mountain
ash
was
so
like
her
laughter
that
his
heart
tightened
and
then
grew
large
and
all
these
things
made
him
see
that
something
must
be
done
at
once
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
andrew
hale
who
was
a
man
might
be
induced
to
reconsider
his
refusal
and
advance
a
small
sum
on
the
lumber
if
he
were
told
that
zeena
made
it
necessary
to
hire
a
servant
hale
after
all
knew
enough
of
ethan
situation
to
make
it
possible
for
the
latter
to
renew
his
appeal
without
too
much
loss
of
pride
and
moreover
how
much
did
pride
count
in
the
ebullition
of
passions
in
his
breast
the
more
he
considered
his
plan
the
more
hopeful
it
seemed
if
he
could
get
hale
ear
he
felt
certain
of
success
and
with
fifty
dollars
in
his
pocket
nothing
could
keep
him
from
mattie
his
first
object
was
to
reach
starkfield
before
hale
had
started
for
his
work
he
knew
the
carpenter
had
a
job
down
the
corbury
road
and
was
likely
to
leave
his
house
early
ethan
long
strides
grew
more
rapid
with
the
accelerated
beat
of
his
thoughts
and
as
he
reached
the
foot
of
school
house
hill
he
caught
sight
of
hale
sleigh
in
the
distance
he
hurried
forward
to
meet
it
but
as
it
drew
nearer
he
saw
that
it
was
driven
by
the
carpenter
youngest
boy
and
that
the
figure
at
his
side
looking
like
a
large
upright
cocoon
in
spectacles
was
that
of
hale
ethan
signed
to
them
to
stop
and
hale
leaned
forward
her
pink
wrinkles
twinkling
with
benevolence
mr
hale
why
yes
you
find
him
down
home
now
he
ai
going
to
his
work
this
forenoon
he
woke
up
with
a
touch
o
lumbago
and
i
just
made
him
put
on
one
of
old
kidder
plasters
and
set
right
up
into
the
beaming
maternally
on
ethan
she
bent
over
to
add
i
just
heard
from
hale
zeena
going
over
to
bettsbridge
to
see
that
new
doctor
i
real
sorry
she
feeling
so
bad
again
i
hope
he
thinks
he
can
do
something
for
her
i
do
know
anybody
round
here
had
more
sickness
than
zeena
i
always
tell
hale
i
do
know
what
she
done
if
she
had
had
you
to
look
after
her
and
i
used
to
say
the
same
thing
your
mother
you
had
an
awful
mean
time
ethan
she
gave
him
a
last
nod
of
sympathy
while
her
son
chirped
to
the
horse
and
ethan
as
she
drove
off
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
stared
after
the
retreating
sleigh
it
was
a
long
time
since
any
one
had
spoken
to
him
as
kindly
as
hale
most
people
were
either
indifferent
to
his
troubles
or
disposed
to
think
it
natural
that
a
young
fellow
of
his
age
should
have
carried
without
repining
the
burden
of
three
crippled
lives
but
hale
had
said
you
had
an
awful
mean
time
ethan
frome
and
he
felt
less
alone
with
his
misery
if
the
hales
were
sorry
for
him
they
would
surely
respond
to
his
appeal
he
started
down
the
road
toward
their
house
but
at
the
end
of
a
few
yards
he
pulled
up
sharply
the
blood
in
his
face
for
the
first
time
in
the
light
of
the
words
he
had
just
heard
he
saw
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
was
planning
to
take
advantage
of
the
hales
sympathy
to
obtain
money
from
them
on
false
pretences
that
was
a
plain
statement
of
the
cloudy
purpose
which
had
driven
him
in
headlong
to
starkfield
with
the
sudden
perception
of
the
point
to
which
his
madness
had
carried
him
the
madness
fell
and
he
saw
his
life
before
him
as
it
was
he
was
a
poor
man
the
husband
of
a
sickly
woman
whom
his
desertion
would
leave
alone
and
destitute
and
even
if
he
had
had
the
heart
to
desert
her
he
could
have
done
so
only
by
deceiving
two
kindly
people
who
had
pitied
him
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
farm
ix
at
the
kitchen
door
daniel
byrne
sat
in
his
sleigh
behind
a
grey
who
pawed
the
snow
and
swung
his
long
head
restlessly
from
side
to
side
ethan
went
into
the
kitchen
and
found
his
wife
by
the
stove
her
head
was
wrapped
in
her
shawl
and
she
was
reading
a
book
called
kidney
troubles
and
their
cure
on
which
he
had
had
to
pay
extra
postage
only
a
few
days
before
zeena
did
not
move
or
look
up
when
he
entered
and
after
a
moment
he
asked
where
mattie
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
page
she
replied
i
presume
getting
down
her
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
getting
down
her
trunk
alone
jotham
powell
down
in
the
and
byrne
says
he
leave
that
horse
she
returned
her
husband
without
stopping
to
hear
the
end
of
the
phrase
had
left
the
kitchen
and
sprung
up
the
stairs
the
door
of
mattie
room
was
shut
and
he
wavered
a
moment
on
the
landing
matt
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
there
was
no
answer
and
he
put
his
hand
on
the
he
had
never
been
in
her
room
except
once
in
the
early
summer
when
he
had
gone
there
to
plaster
up
a
leak
in
the
eaves
but
he
remembered
exactly
how
everything
had
looked
the
quilt
on
her
narrow
bed
the
pretty
on
the
chest
of
drawers
and
over
it
the
enlarged
photograph
of
her
mother
in
an
oxydized
frame
with
a
bunch
of
dyed
grasses
at
the
back
now
these
and
all
other
tokens
of
her
presence
had
vanished
and
the
room
looked
as
bare
and
comfortless
as
when
zeena
had
shown
her
into
it
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
stood
her
trunk
and
on
the
trunk
she
sat
in
her
sunday
dress
her
back
turned
to
the
door
and
her
face
in
her
hands
she
had
not
heard
ethan
call
because
she
was
sobbing
and
she
did
not
hear
his
step
till
he
stood
close
behind
her
and
laid
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
matt
oh
do
oh
matt
she
started
up
lifting
her
wet
face
to
his
ethan
i
thought
i
ever
going
to
see
you
again
he
took
her
in
his
arms
pressing
her
close
and
with
a
trembling
hand
smoothed
away
the
hair
from
her
forehead
not
see
me
again
what
do
you
mean
she
sobbed
out
jotham
said
you
told
him
we
was
to
wait
dinner
for
you
and
i
thought
you
thought
i
meant
to
cut
it
he
finished
for
her
grimly
she
clung
to
him
without
answering
and
he
laid
his
lips
on
her
hair
which
was
soft
yet
springy
like
certain
mosses
on
warm
slopes
and
had
the
faint
woody
fragrance
of
fresh
sawdust
in
the
sun
through
the
door
they
heard
zeena
voice
calling
out
from
below
byrne
says
you
better
hurry
up
if
you
want
him
to
take
that
they
drew
apart
with
stricken
faces
words
of
resistance
rushed
to
ethan
lips
and
died
there
mattie
found
her
handkerchief
and
dried
her
eyes
then
bending
down
she
took
hold
of
a
handle
of
the
trunk
ethan
put
her
aside
you
let
go
matt
he
ordered
her
she
answered
it
takes
two
to
coax
it
round
the
corner
and
submitting
to
this
argument
he
grasped
the
other
handle
and
together
they
manoeuvred
the
heavy
trunk
out
to
the
landing
now
let
go
he
repeated
then
he
shouldered
the
trunk
and
carried
it
down
the
stairs
and
across
the
passage
to
the
kitchen
zeena
who
had
gone
back
to
her
seat
by
the
stove
did
not
lift
her
head
from
her
book
as
he
passed
mattie
followed
him
out
of
the
door
and
helped
him
to
lift
the
trunk
into
the
back
of
the
sleigh
when
it
was
in
place
they
stood
side
by
side
on
the
watching
daniel
byrne
plunge
off
behind
his
fidgety
horse
it
seemed
to
ethan
that
his
heart
was
bound
with
cords
which
an
unseen
hand
was
tightening
with
every
tick
of
the
clock
twice
he
opened
his
lips
to
speak
to
mattie
and
found
no
breath
at
length
as
she
turned
to
the
house
he
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
i
going
to
drive
you
over
matt
he
whispered
she
murmured
back
i
think
zeena
wants
i
should
go
with
i
going
to
drive
you
over
he
repeated
and
she
went
into
the
kitchen
without
answering
at
dinner
ethan
could
not
eat
if
he
lifted
his
eyes
they
rested
on
zeena
pinched
face
and
the
corners
of
her
straight
lips
seemed
to
quiver
away
into
a
smile
she
ate
well
declaring
that
the
mild
weather
made
her
feel
better
and
pressed
a
second
helping
of
beans
on
jotham
powell
whose
wants
she
generally
ignored
mattie
when
the
meal
was
over
went
about
her
usual
task
of
clearing
the
table
and
washing
up
the
dishes
zeena
after
feeding
the
cat
had
returned
to
her
by
the
stove
and
jotham
powell
who
always
lingered
last
reluctantly
pushed
back
his
chair
and
moved
toward
the
door
on
the
threshold
he
turned
back
to
say
to
ethan
what
time
i
come
round
for
mattie
ethan
was
standing
near
the
window
mechanically
filling
his
pipe
while
he
watched
mattie
move
to
and
fro
he
answered
you
need
come
round
i
going
to
drive
her
over
he
saw
the
rise
of
the
colour
in
mattie
averted
cheek
and
the
quick
lifting
of
zeena
head
i
want
you
should
stay
here
this
afternoon
ethan
his
wife
said
jotham
can
drive
mattie
mattie
flung
an
imploring
glance
at
him
but
he
repeated
curtly
going
to
drive
her
over
zeena
continued
in
the
same
even
tone
i
wanted
you
should
stay
and
fix
up
that
stove
in
mattie
room
afore
the
girl
gets
here
it
ai
been
drawing
right
for
nigh
on
a
month
ethan
voice
rose
indignantly
if
it
was
good
enough
for
mattie
i
guess
it
good
enough
for
a
hired
that
girl
that
coming
told
me
she
was
used
to
a
house
where
they
had
a
furnace
zeena
persisted
with
the
same
monotonous
mildness
she
better
ha
stayed
there
then
he
flung
back
at
her
and
turning
to
mattie
he
added
in
a
hard
voice
you
be
ready
by
three
matt
got
business
at
jotham
powell
had
started
for
the
barn
and
ethan
strode
down
after
him
aflame
with
anger
the
pulses
in
his
temples
throbbed
and
a
fog
was
in
his
eyes
he
went
about
his
task
without
knowing
what
force
directed
him
or
whose
hands
and
feet
were
fulfilling
its
orders
it
was
not
till
he
led
out
the
sorrel
and
backed
him
between
the
shafts
of
the
sleigh
that
he
once
more
became
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
as
he
passed
the
bridle
over
the
horse
head
and
wound
the
traces
around
the
shafts
he
remembered
the
day
when
he
had
made
the
same
preparations
in
order
to
drive
over
and
meet
his
wife
cousin
at
the
flats
it
was
little
more
than
a
year
ago
on
just
such
a
soft
afternoon
with
a
feel
of
spring
in
the
air
the
sorrel
turning
the
same
big
ringed
eye
on
him
nuzzled
the
palm
of
his
hand
in
the
same
way
and
one
by
one
all
the
days
between
rose
up
and
stood
before
him
he
flung
the
bearskin
into
the
sleigh
climbed
to
the
seat
and
drove
up
to
the
house
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
it
was
empty
but
mattie
bag
and
shawl
lay
ready
by
the
door
he
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
listened
no
sound
reached
him
from
above
but
presently
he
thought
he
heard
some
one
moving
about
in
his
deserted
study
and
pushing
open
the
door
he
saw
mattie
in
her
hat
and
jacket
standing
with
her
back
to
him
near
the
table
she
started
at
his
approach
and
turning
quickly
said
is
it
time
what
are
you
doing
here
matt
he
asked
her
she
looked
at
him
timidly
i
was
just
taking
a
look
round
that
all
she
answered
with
a
wavering
smile
they
went
back
into
the
kitchen
without
speaking
and
ethan
picked
up
her
bag
and
shawl
where
zeena
he
asked
she
went
upstairs
right
after
dinner
she
said
she
had
those
shooting
pains
again
and
did
want
to
be
did
she
say
to
you
no
that
was
all
she
ethan
looking
slowly
about
the
kitchen
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
that
in
a
few
hours
he
would
be
returning
to
it
alone
then
the
sense
of
unreality
overcame
him
once
more
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
mattie
stood
there
for
the
last
time
before
him
come
on
he
said
almost
gaily
opening
the
door
and
putting
her
bag
into
the
sleigh
he
sprang
to
his
seat
and
bent
over
to
tuck
the
rug
about
her
as
she
slipped
into
the
place
at
his
side
now
then
go
he
said
with
a
shake
of
the
reins
that
sent
the
sorrel
placidly
jogging
down
the
hill
we
got
lots
of
time
for
a
good
ride
matt
he
cried
seeking
her
hand
beneath
the
fur
and
pressing
it
in
his
his
face
tingled
and
he
felt
dizzy
as
if
he
had
stopped
in
at
the
starkfield
saloon
on
a
zero
day
for
a
drink
at
the
gate
instead
of
making
for
starkfield
he
turned
the
sorrel
to
the
right
up
the
bettsbridge
road
mattie
sat
silent
giving
no
sign
of
surprise
but
after
a
moment
she
said
are
you
going
round
by
shadow
pond
he
laughed
and
answered
i
knew
you
know
she
drew
closer
under
the
bearskin
so
that
looking
sideways
around
his
he
could
just
catch
the
tip
of
her
nose
and
a
blown
brown
wave
of
hair
they
drove
slowly
up
the
road
between
fields
glistening
under
the
pale
sun
and
then
bent
to
the
right
down
a
lane
edged
with
spruce
and
larch
ahead
of
them
a
long
way
off
a
range
of
hills
stained
by
mottlings
of
black
forest
flowed
away
in
round
white
curves
against
the
sky
the
lane
passed
into
a
with
boles
reddening
in
the
afternoon
sun
and
delicate
blue
shadows
on
the
snow
as
they
entered
it
the
breeze
fell
and
a
warm
stillness
seemed
to
drop
from
the
branches
with
the
dropping
needles
here
the
snow
was
so
pure
that
the
tiny
tracks
of
had
left
on
it
intricate
patterns
and
the
bluish
cones
caught
in
its
surface
stood
out
like
ornaments
of
bronze
ethan
drove
on
in
silence
till
they
reached
a
part
of
the
wood
where
the
pines
were
more
widely
spaced
then
he
drew
up
and
helped
mattie
to
get
out
of
the
sleigh
they
passed
between
the
aromatic
trunks
the
snow
breaking
crisply
under
their
feet
till
they
came
to
a
small
sheet
of
water
with
steep
wooded
sides
across
its
frozen
surface
from
the
farther
bank
a
single
hill
rising
against
the
western
sun
threw
the
long
conical
shadow
which
gave
the
lake
its
name
it
was
a
shy
secret
spot
full
of
the
same
dumb
melancholy
that
ethan
felt
in
his
heart
he
looked
up
and
down
the
little
pebbly
beach
till
his
eye
lit
on
a
fallen
half
submerged
in
snow
there
where
we
sat
at
the
picnic
he
reminded
her
the
entertainment
of
which
he
spoke
was
one
of
the
few
that
they
had
taken
part
in
together
a
church
picnic
which
on
a
long
afternoon
of
the
preceding
summer
had
filled
the
retired
place
with
mattie
had
begged
him
to
go
with
her
but
he
had
refused
then
toward
sunset
coming
down
from
the
mountain
where
he
had
been
felling
timber
he
had
been
caught
by
some
strayed
revellers
and
drawn
into
the
group
by
the
lake
where
mattie
encircled
by
facetious
youths
and
bright
as
a
blackberry
under
her
spreading
hat
was
brewing
coffee
over
a
gipsy
fire
he
remembered
the
shyness
he
had
felt
at
approaching
her
in
his
uncouth
clothes
and
then
the
lighting
up
of
her
face
and
the
way
she
had
broken
through
the
group
to
come
to
him
with
a
cup
in
her
hand
they
had
sat
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
fallen
log
by
the
pond
and
she
had
missed
her
gold
locket
and
set
the
young
men
searching
for
it
and
it
was
ethan
who
had
spied
it
in
the
moss
that
was
all
but
all
their
intercourse
had
been
made
up
of
just
such
inarticulate
flashes
when
they
seemed
to
come
suddenly
upon
happiness
as
if
they
had
surprised
a
butterfly
in
the
winter
woods
it
was
right
there
i
found
your
locket
he
said
pushing
his
foot
into
a
dense
tuft
of
blueberry
bushes
i
never
saw
anybody
with
such
sharp
eyes
she
answered
she
sat
down
on
the
in
the
sun
and
he
sat
down
beside
her
you
were
as
pretty
as
a
picture
in
that
pink
hat
he
said
she
laughed
with
pleasure
oh
i
guess
it
was
the
hat
she
rejoined
they
had
never
before
avowed
their
inclination
so
openly
and
ethan
for
a
moment
had
the
illusion
that
he
was
a
free
man
wooing
the
girl
he
meant
to
marry
he
looked
at
her
hair
and
longed
to
touch
it
again
and
to
tell
her
that
it
smelt
of
the
woods
but
he
had
never
learned
to
say
such
things
suddenly
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
said
we
must
stay
here
any
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
vaguely
only
from
his
dream
there
plenty
of
time
he
answered
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
as
if
the
eyes
of
each
were
straining
to
absorb
and
hold
fast
the
other
image
there
were
things
he
had
to
say
to
her
before
they
parted
but
he
could
not
say
them
in
that
place
of
summer
memories
and
he
turned
and
followed
her
in
silence
to
the
sleigh
as
they
drove
away
the
sun
sank
behind
the
hill
and
the
turned
from
red
to
grey
by
a
devious
track
between
the
fields
they
wound
back
to
the
starkfield
road
under
the
open
sky
the
light
was
still
clear
with
a
reflection
of
cold
red
on
the
eastern
hills
the
clumps
of
trees
in
the
snow
seemed
to
draw
together
in
ruffled
lumps
like
birds
with
their
heads
under
their
wings
and
the
sky
as
it
paled
rose
higher
leaving
the
earth
more
alone
as
they
turned
into
the
starkfield
road
ethan
said
matt
what
do
you
mean
to
do
she
did
not
answer
at
once
but
at
length
she
said
i
try
to
get
a
place
in
a
you
know
you
ca
do
it
the
bad
air
and
the
standing
all
day
nearly
killed
you
i
a
lot
stronger
than
i
was
before
i
came
to
and
now
you
going
to
throw
away
all
the
good
it
done
you
there
seemed
to
be
no
answer
to
this
and
again
they
drove
on
for
a
while
without
speaking
with
every
yard
of
the
way
some
spot
where
they
had
stood
and
laughed
together
or
been
silent
clutched
at
ethan
and
dragged
him
back
is
there
any
of
your
father
folks
could
help
you
there
is
any
of
i
he
lowered
his
voice
to
say
you
know
there
nothing
i
would
do
for
you
if
i
i
know
there
but
i
ca
she
was
silent
but
he
felt
a
slight
tremor
in
the
shoulder
against
his
oh
matt
he
broke
out
if
i
could
ha
gone
with
you
now
i
ha
done
it
she
turned
to
him
pulling
a
scrap
of
paper
from
her
breast
ethan
i
found
this
she
stammered
even
in
the
failing
light
he
saw
it
was
the
letter
to
his
wife
that
he
had
begun
the
night
before
and
forgotten
to
destroy
through
his
astonishment
there
ran
a
fierce
thrill
of
joy
matt
he
cried
if
i
could
ha
done
it
would
you
oh
ethan
ethan
what
the
use
with
a
sudden
movement
she
tore
the
letter
in
shreds
and
sent
them
fluttering
off
into
the
snow
tell
me
matt
tell
me
he
adjured
her
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
said
in
such
a
low
tone
that
he
had
to
stoop
his
head
to
hear
her
i
used
to
think
of
it
sometimes
summer
nights
when
the
moon
was
so
bright
i
could
his
heart
reeled
with
the
sweetness
of
it
as
long
ago
as
that
she
answered
as
if
the
date
had
long
been
fixed
for
her
the
first
time
was
at
shadow
was
that
why
you
gave
me
my
coffee
before
the
others
i
do
know
did
i
i
was
dreadfully
put
out
when
you
would
go
to
the
picnic
with
me
and
then
when
i
saw
you
coming
down
the
road
i
thought
maybe
you
gone
home
that
way
o
purpose
and
that
made
me
they
were
silent
again
they
had
reached
the
point
where
the
road
dipped
to
the
hollow
by
ethan
mill
and
as
they
descended
the
darkness
descended
with
them
dropping
down
like
a
black
veil
from
the
heavy
hemlock
boughs
i
tied
hand
and
foot
matt
there
is
a
thing
i
can
do
he
began
again
you
must
write
to
me
sometimes
oh
what
good
writing
do
i
want
to
put
my
hand
out
and
touch
you
i
want
to
do
for
you
and
care
for
you
i
want
to
be
there
when
you
sick
and
when
you
you
must
think
but
what
i
do
all
you
wo
need
me
you
mean
i
suppose
you
marry
oh
ethan
she
cried
i
do
know
how
it
is
you
make
me
feel
matt
i
rather
have
you
dead
than
that
oh
i
wish
i
was
i
wish
i
was
she
sobbed
the
sound
of
her
weeping
shook
him
out
of
his
dark
anger
and
he
felt
ashamed
do
let
talk
that
way
he
whispered
why
should
we
when
it
true
i
been
wishing
it
every
minute
of
the
matt
you
be
quiet
do
you
say
there
never
anybody
been
good
to
me
but
do
say
that
either
when
i
ca
lift
a
hand
for
you
yes
but
it
true
just
the
they
had
reached
the
top
of
school
house
hill
and
starkfield
lay
below
them
in
the
twilight
a
cutter
mounting
the
road
from
the
village
passed
them
by
in
a
joyous
flutter
of
bells
and
they
straightened
themselves
and
looked
ahead
with
rigid
faces
along
the
main
street
lights
had
begun
to
shine
from
the
and
stray
figures
were
turning
in
here
and
there
at
the
gates
ethan
with
a
touch
of
his
whip
roused
the
sorrel
to
a
languid
trot
as
they
drew
near
the
end
of
the
village
the
cries
of
children
reached
them
and
they
saw
a
knot
of
boys
with
sleds
behind
them
scattering
across
the
open
space
before
the
church
i
guess
this
be
their
last
coast
for
a
day
or
two
ethan
said
looking
up
at
the
mild
sky
mattie
was
silent
and
he
added
we
were
to
have
gone
down
last
still
she
did
not
speak
and
prompted
by
an
obscure
desire
to
help
himself
and
her
through
their
miserable
last
hour
he
went
on
discursively
ai
it
funny
we
have
been
down
together
but
just
that
once
last
winter
she
answered
it
was
often
i
got
down
to
the
that
so
he
said
they
had
reached
the
crest
of
the
corbury
road
and
between
the
indistinct
white
glimmer
of
the
church
and
the
black
curtain
of
the
varnum
spruces
the
slope
stretched
away
below
them
without
a
sled
on
its
length
some
erratic
impulse
prompted
ethan
to
say
how
you
like
me
to
take
you
down
now
she
forced
a
laugh
why
there
is
time
there
all
the
time
we
want
come
along
his
one
desire
now
was
to
postpone
the
moment
of
turning
the
sorrel
toward
the
flats
but
the
girl
she
faltered
the
girl
be
waiting
at
the
well
let
her
wait
you
have
to
if
she
did
come
the
note
of
authority
in
his
voice
seemed
to
subdue
her
and
when
he
had
jumped
from
the
sleigh
she
let
him
help
her
out
saying
only
with
a
vague
feint
of
reluctance
but
there
is
a
sled
round
yes
there
is
right
over
there
under
the
he
threw
the
bearskin
over
the
sorrel
who
stood
passively
by
the
roadside
hanging
a
meditative
head
then
he
caught
mattie
hand
and
drew
her
after
him
toward
the
sled
she
seated
herself
obediently
and
he
took
his
place
behind
her
so
close
that
her
hair
brushed
his
face
all
right
matt
he
called
out
as
if
the
width
of
the
road
had
been
between
them
she
turned
her
head
to
say
it
dreadfully
dark
are
you
sure
you
can
see
he
laughed
contemptuously
i
could
go
down
this
coast
with
my
eyes
tied
and
she
laughed
with
him
as
if
she
liked
his
audacity
nevertheless
he
sat
still
a
moment
straining
his
eyes
down
the
long
hill
for
it
was
the
most
confusing
hour
of
the
evening
the
hour
when
the
last
clearness
from
the
upper
sky
is
merged
with
the
rising
night
in
a
blur
that
disguises
landmarks
and
falsifies
distances
now
he
cried
the
sled
started
with
a
bound
and
they
flew
on
through
the
dusk
gathering
smoothness
and
speed
as
they
went
with
the
hollow
night
opening
out
below
them
and
the
air
singing
by
like
an
organ
mattie
sat
perfectly
still
but
as
they
reached
the
bend
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
the
big
elm
thrust
out
a
deadly
elbow
he
fancied
that
she
shrank
a
little
closer
do
be
scared
matt
he
cried
exultantly
as
they
spun
safely
past
it
and
flew
down
the
second
slope
and
when
they
reached
the
level
ground
beyond
and
the
speed
of
the
sled
began
to
slacken
he
heard
her
give
a
little
laugh
of
glee
they
sprang
off
and
started
to
walk
back
up
the
hill
ethan
dragged
the
sled
with
one
hand
and
passed
the
other
through
mattie
arm
were
you
scared
i
run
you
into
the
elm
he
asked
with
a
boyish
laugh
i
told
you
i
was
never
scared
with
you
she
answered
the
strange
exaltation
of
his
mood
had
brought
on
one
of
his
rare
fits
of
boastfulness
it
is
a
tricky
place
though
the
least
swerve
and
we
never
ha
come
up
again
but
i
can
measure
distances
to
a
always
she
murmured
i
always
say
you
got
the
surest
eye
deep
silence
had
fallen
with
the
starless
dusk
and
they
leaned
on
each
other
without
speaking
but
at
every
step
of
their
climb
ethan
said
to
himself
it
the
last
time
we
ever
walk
they
mounted
slowly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
when
they
were
abreast
of
the
church
he
stooped
his
head
to
her
to
ask
are
you
tired
and
she
answered
breathing
quickly
it
was
splendid
with
a
pressure
of
his
arm
he
guided
her
toward
the
norway
spruces
i
guess
this
sled
must
be
ned
hale
anyhow
i
leave
it
where
i
found
he
drew
the
sled
up
to
the
varnum
gate
and
rested
it
against
the
fence
as
he
raised
himself
he
suddenly
felt
mattie
close
to
him
among
the
shadows
is
this
where
ned
and
ruth
kissed
each
other
she
whispered
breathlessly
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
her
lips
groping
for
his
swept
over
his
face
and
he
held
her
fast
in
a
rapture
of
surprise
she
stammered
and
kissed
him
again
oh
matt
i
ca
let
you
go
broke
from
him
in
the
same
old
cry
she
freed
herself
from
his
hold
and
he
heard
her
sobbing
oh
i
go
either
she
wailed
matt
what
we
do
what
we
do
they
clung
to
each
other
hands
like
children
and
her
body
shook
with
desperate
sobs
through
the
stillness
they
heard
the
church
clock
striking
five
oh
ethan
it
time
she
cried
he
drew
her
back
to
him
time
for
what
you
do
suppose
i
going
to
leave
you
now
if
i
missed
my
train
where
i
go
where
are
you
going
if
you
catch
it
she
stood
silent
her
hands
lying
cold
and
relaxed
in
his
what
the
good
of
either
of
us
going
anywheres
without
the
other
one
now
he
said
she
remained
motionless
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
then
she
snatched
her
hands
from
his
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
pressed
a
sudden
drenched
cheek
against
his
face
ethan
ethan
i
want
you
to
take
me
down
again
down
where
the
coast
right
off
she
panted
so
we
never
come
up
any
matt
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
she
put
her
lips
close
against
his
ear
to
say
right
into
the
big
elm
you
said
you
could
so
we
never
have
to
leave
each
other
any
why
what
are
you
talking
of
you
crazy
i
not
crazy
but
i
will
be
if
i
leave
oh
matt
matt
he
groaned
she
tightened
her
fierce
hold
about
his
neck
her
face
lay
close
to
his
face
ethan
where
i
go
if
i
leave
you
i
do
know
how
to
get
along
alone
you
said
so
yourself
just
now
nobody
but
you
was
ever
good
to
me
and
there
be
that
strange
girl
in
the
house
and
she
sleep
in
my
bed
where
i
used
to
lay
nights
and
listen
to
hear
you
come
up
the
stairs
the
words
were
like
fragments
torn
from
his
heart
with
them
came
the
hated
vision
of
the
house
he
was
going
back
to
of
the
stairs
he
would
have
to
go
up
every
night
of
the
woman
who
would
wait
for
him
there
and
the
sweetness
of
mattie
avowal
the
wild
wonder
of
knowing
at
last
that
all
that
had
happened
to
him
had
happened
to
her
too
made
the
other
vision
more
abhorrent
the
other
life
more
intolerable
to
return
to
her
pleadings
still
came
to
him
between
short
sobs
but
he
no
longer
heard
what
she
was
saying
her
hat
had
slipped
back
and
he
was
stroking
her
hair
he
wanted
to
get
the
feeling
of
it
into
his
hand
so
that
it
would
sleep
there
like
a
seed
in
winter
once
he
found
her
mouth
again
and
they
seemed
to
be
by
the
pond
together
in
the
burning
august
sun
but
his
cheek
touched
hers
and
it
was
cold
and
full
of
weeping
and
he
saw
the
road
to
the
flats
under
the
night
and
heard
the
whistle
of
the
train
up
the
line
the
spruces
swathed
them
in
blackness
and
silence
they
might
have
been
in
their
coffins
underground
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
it
feel
like
this
and
then
again
after
this
i
feel
anything
suddenly
he
heard
the
old
sorrel
whinny
across
the
road
and
thought
he
wondering
why
he
does
get
his
supper
come
mattie
whispered
tugging
at
his
hand
her
sombre
violence
constrained
him
she
seemed
the
embodied
instrument
of
fate
he
pulled
the
sled
out
blinking
like
a
as
he
passed
from
the
shade
of
the
spruces
into
the
transparent
dusk
of
the
open
the
slope
below
them
was
deserted
all
starkfield
was
at
supper
and
not
a
figure
crossed
the
open
space
before
the
church
the
sky
swollen
with
the
clouds
that
announce
a
thaw
hung
as
low
as
before
a
summer
storm
he
strained
his
eyes
through
the
dimness
and
they
seemed
less
keen
less
capable
than
usual
he
took
his
seat
on
the
sled
and
mattie
instantly
placed
herself
in
front
of
him
her
hat
had
fallen
into
the
snow
and
his
lips
were
in
her
hair
he
stretched
out
his
legs
drove
his
heels
into
the
road
to
keep
the
sled
from
slipping
forward
and
bent
her
head
back
between
his
hands
then
suddenly
he
sprang
up
again
get
up
he
ordered
her
it
was
the
tone
she
always
heeded
but
she
cowered
down
in
her
seat
repeating
vehemently
no
no
no
get
up
why
i
want
to
sit
in
no
no
how
can
you
steer
in
front
i
do
have
to
we
follow
the
they
spoke
in
smothered
whispers
as
though
the
night
were
listening
get
up
get
up
he
urged
her
but
she
kept
on
repeating
why
do
you
want
to
sit
in
front
because
i
because
i
want
to
feel
you
holding
me
he
stammered
and
dragged
her
to
her
feet
the
answer
seemed
to
satisfy
her
or
else
she
yielded
to
the
power
of
his
voice
he
bent
down
feeling
in
the
obscurity
for
the
glassy
slide
worn
by
preceding
coasters
and
placed
the
runners
carefully
between
its
edges
she
waited
while
he
seated
himself
with
crossed
legs
in
the
front
of
the
sled
then
she
crouched
quickly
down
at
his
back
and
clasped
her
arms
about
him
her
breath
in
his
neck
set
him
shuddering
again
and
he
almost
sprang
from
his
seat
but
in
a
flash
he
remembered
the
alternative
she
was
right
this
was
better
than
parting
he
leaned
back
and
drew
her
mouth
to
his
just
as
they
started
he
heard
the
sorrel
whinny
again
and
the
familiar
wistful
call
and
all
the
confused
images
it
brought
with
it
went
with
him
down
the
first
reach
of
the
road
down
there
was
a
sudden
drop
then
a
rise
and
after
that
another
long
delirious
descent
as
they
took
wing
for
this
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
flying
indeed
flying
far
up
into
the
cloudy
night
with
starkfield
immeasurably
below
them
falling
away
like
a
speck
in
space
then
the
big
elm
shot
up
ahead
lying
in
wait
for
them
at
the
bend
of
the
road
and
he
said
between
his
teeth
we
can
fetch
it
i
know
we
can
fetch
it
as
they
flew
toward
the
tree
mattie
pressed
her
arms
tighter
and
her
blood
seemed
to
be
in
his
veins
once
or
twice
the
sled
swerved
a
little
under
them
he
slanted
his
body
to
keep
it
headed
for
the
elm
repeating
to
himself
again
and
again
i
know
we
can
fetch
it
and
little
phrases
she
had
spoken
ran
through
his
head
and
danced
before
him
on
the
air
the
big
tree
loomed
bigger
and
closer
and
as
they
bore
down
on
it
he
thought
it
waiting
for
us
it
seems
to
but
suddenly
his
wife
face
with
twisted
monstrous
lineaments
thrust
itself
between
him
and
his
goal
and
he
made
an
instinctive
movement
to
brush
it
aside
the
sled
swerved
in
response
but
he
righted
it
again
kept
it
straight
and
drove
down
on
the
black
projecting
mass
there
was
a
last
instant
when
the
air
shot
past
him
like
millions
of
fiery
wires
and
then
the
elm
the
sky
was
still
thick
but
looking
straight
up
he
saw
a
single
star
and
tried
vaguely
to
reckon
whether
it
were
sirius
or
or
the
effort
tired
him
too
much
and
he
closed
his
heavy
lids
and
thought
that
he
would
sleep
the
stillness
was
so
profound
that
he
heard
a
little
animal
twittering
somewhere
near
by
under
the
snow
it
made
a
small
frightened
cheep
like
a
field
mouse
and
he
wondered
languidly
if
it
were
hurt
then
he
understood
that
it
must
be
in
pain
pain
so
excruciating
that
he
seemed
mysteriously
to
feel
it
shooting
through
his
own
body
he
tried
in
vain
to
roll
over
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
stretched
his
left
arm
out
across
the
snow
and
now
it
was
as
though
he
felt
rather
than
heard
the
twittering
it
seemed
to
be
under
his
palm
which
rested
on
something
soft
and
springy
the
thought
of
the
animal
suffering
was
intolerable
to
him
and
he
struggled
to
raise
himself
and
could
not
because
a
rock
or
some
huge
mass
seemed
to
be
lying
on
him
but
he
continued
to
finger
about
cautiously
with
his
left
hand
thinking
he
might
get
hold
of
the
little
creature
and
help
it
and
all
at
once
he
knew
that
the
soft
thing
he
had
touched
was
mattie
hair
and
that
his
hand
was
on
her
face
he
dragged
himself
to
his
knees
the
monstrous
load
on
him
moving
with
him
as
he
moved
and
his
hand
went
over
and
over
her
face
and
he
felt
that
the
twittering
came
from
her
lips
he
got
his
face
down
close
to
hers
with
his
ear
to
her
mouth
and
in
the
darkness
he
saw
her
eyes
open
and
heard
her
say
his
name
oh
matt
i
thought
we
fetched
it
he
moaned
and
far
off
up
the
hill
he
heard
the
sorrel
whinny
and
thought
i
ought
to
be
getting
him
his
feed
the
querulous
drone
ceased
as
i
entered
frome
kitchen
and
of
the
two
women
sitting
there
i
could
not
tell
which
had
been
the
speaker
one
of
them
on
my
appearing
raised
her
tall
bony
figure
from
her
seat
not
as
if
to
welcome
me
for
she
threw
me
no
more
than
a
brief
glance
of
surprise
but
simply
to
set
about
preparing
the
meal
which
absence
had
delayed
a
slatternly
calico
wrapper
hung
from
her
shoulders
and
the
wisps
of
her
thin
grey
hair
were
drawn
away
from
a
high
forehead
and
fastened
at
the
back
by
a
broken
comb
she
had
pale
opaque
eyes
which
revealed
nothing
and
reflected
nothing
and
her
narrow
lips
were
of
the
same
sallow
colour
as
her
face
the
other
woman
was
much
smaller
and
slighter
she
sat
huddled
in
an
near
the
stove
and
when
i
came
in
she
turned
her
head
quickly
toward
me
without
the
least
corresponding
movement
of
her
body
her
hair
was
as
grey
as
her
companion
her
face
as
bloodless
and
shrivelled
but
with
swarthy
shadows
sharpening
the
nose
and
hollowing
the
temples
under
her
shapeless
dress
her
body
kept
its
limp
immobility
and
her
dark
eyes
had
the
bright
stare
that
disease
of
the
spine
sometimes
gives
even
for
that
part
of
the
country
the
kitchen
was
a
place
with
the
exception
of
the
woman
chair
which
looked
like
a
soiled
relic
of
luxury
bought
at
a
country
auction
the
furniture
was
of
the
roughest
kind
three
coarse
china
plates
and
a
had
been
set
on
a
greasy
table
scored
with
and
a
couple
of
chairs
and
a
kitchen
dresser
of
unpainted
pine
stood
meagrely
against
the
plaster
walls
my
it
cold
here
the
fire
must
be
out
frome
said
glancing
about
him
apologetically
as
he
followed
me
in
the
tall
woman
who
had
moved
away
from
us
toward
the
dresser
took
no
notice
but
the
other
from
her
cushioned
niche
answered
complainingly
in
a
high
thin
voice
it
just
been
made
up
this
very
minute
zeena
fell
asleep
and
slep
ever
so
long
and
i
thought
i
be
frozen
stiff
before
i
could
wake
her
up
and
get
her
to
to
i
knew
then
that
it
was
she
who
had
been
speaking
when
we
entered
her
companion
who
was
just
coming
back
to
the
table
with
the
remains
of
a
cold
in
a
battered
set
down
her
unappetising
burden
without
appearing
to
hear
the
accusation
brought
against
her
frome
stood
hesitatingly
before
her
as
she
advanced
then
he
looked
at
me
and
said
this
is
my
wife
mis
after
another
interval
he
added
turning
toward
the
figure
in
the
and
this
is
miss
mattie
silver
hale
tender
soul
had
pictured
me
as
lost
in
the
flats
and
buried
under
a
and
so
lively
was
her
satisfaction
on
seeing
me
safely
restored
to
her
the
next
morning
that
i
felt
my
peril
had
caused
me
to
advance
several
degrees
in
her
favour
great
was
her
amazement
and
that
of
old
varnum
on
learning
that
ethan
frome
old
horse
had
carried
me
to
and
from
corbury
junction
through
the
worst
blizzard
of
the
winter
greater
still
their
surprise
when
they
heard
that
his
master
had
taken
me
in
for
the
night
beneath
their
wondering
exclamations
i
felt
a
secret
curiosity
to
know
what
impressions
i
had
received
from
my
night
in
the
frome
household
and
divined
that
the
best
way
of
breaking
down
their
reserve
was
to
let
them
try
to
penetrate
mine
i
therefore
confined
myself
to
saying
in
a
tone
that
i
had
been
received
with
great
kindness
and
that
frome
had
made
a
bed
for
me
in
a
room
on
the
which
seemed
in
happier
days
to
have
been
fitted
up
as
a
kind
of
or
study
well
hale
mused
in
such
a
storm
i
suppose
he
felt
he
do
less
than
take
you
in
but
i
guess
it
went
hard
with
ethan
i
believe
but
what
you
the
only
stranger
has
set
foot
in
that
house
for
over
twenty
years
he
that
proud
he
do
even
like
his
oldest
friends
to
go
there
and
i
do
know
as
any
do
any
more
except
myself
and
the
doctor
you
still
go
there
hale
i
ventured
i
used
to
go
a
good
deal
after
the
accident
when
i
was
first
married
but
after
awhile
i
got
to
think
it
made
feel
worse
to
see
us
and
then
one
thing
and
another
came
and
my
own
troubles
but
i
generally
make
out
to
drive
over
there
round
about
new
year
and
once
in
the
summer
only
i
always
try
to
pick
a
day
when
ethan
off
somewheres
it
bad
enough
to
see
the
two
women
sitting
there
but
his
face
when
he
looks
round
that
bare
place
just
kills
me
you
see
i
can
look
back
and
call
it
up
in
his
mother
day
before
their
old
varnum
by
this
time
had
gone
up
to
bed
and
her
daughter
and
i
were
sitting
alone
after
supper
in
the
austere
seclusion
of
the
parlour
hale
glanced
at
me
tentatively
as
though
trying
to
see
how
much
footing
my
conjectures
gave
her
and
i
guessed
that
if
she
had
kept
silence
till
now
it
was
because
she
had
been
waiting
through
all
the
years
for
some
one
who
should
see
what
she
alone
had
seen
i
waited
to
let
her
trust
in
me
gather
strength
before
i
said
yes
it
pretty
bad
seeing
all
three
of
them
there
she
drew
her
mild
brows
into
a
frown
of
pain
it
was
just
awful
from
the
beginning
i
was
here
in
the
house
when
they
were
carried
up
they
laid
mattie
silver
in
the
room
you
in
she
and
i
were
great
friends
and
she
was
to
have
been
my
bridesmaid
in
the
spring
when
she
came
to
i
went
up
to
her
and
stayed
all
night
they
gave
her
things
to
quiet
her
and
she
did
know
much
till
morning
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
woke
up
just
like
herself
and
looked
straight
at
me
out
of
her
big
eyes
and
said
oh
i
do
know
why
i
telling
you
all
this
hale
broke
off
crying
she
took
off
her
spectacles
wiped
the
moisture
from
them
and
put
them
on
again
with
an
unsteady
hand
it
got
about
the
next
day
she
went
on
that
zeena
frome
had
sent
mattie
off
in
a
hurry
because
she
had
a
hired
girl
coming
and
the
folks
here
could
never
rightly
tell
what
she
and
ethan
were
doing
that
night
coasting
when
they
ought
to
have
been
on
their
way
to
the
flats
to
ketch
the
train
i
never
knew
myself
what
zeena
thought
i
do
to
this
day
nobody
knows
zeena
thoughts
anyhow
when
she
heard
o
the
accident
she
came
right
in
and
stayed
with
ethan
over
to
the
minister
where
they
carried
him
and
as
soon
as
the
doctors
said
that
mattie
could
be
moved
zeena
sent
for
her
and
took
her
back
to
the
and
there
she
been
ever
since
hale
answered
simply
there
was
nowhere
else
for
her
to
go
and
my
heart
tightened
at
the
thought
of
the
hard
compulsions
of
the
poor
yes
there
she
been
hale
continued
and
zeena
done
for
her
and
done
for
ethan
as
good
as
she
could
it
was
a
miracle
considering
how
sick
she
was
but
she
seemed
to
be
raised
right
up
just
when
the
call
came
to
her
not
as
she
ever
given
up
doctoring
and
she
had
sick
spells
right
along
but
she
had
the
strength
given
her
to
care
for
those
two
for
over
twenty
years
and
before
the
accident
came
she
thought
she
could
even
care
for
hale
paused
a
moment
and
i
remained
silent
plunged
in
the
vision
of
what
her
words
evoked
it
horrible
for
them
all
i
murmured
yes
it
pretty
bad
and
they
ai
any
of
easy
people
either
mattie
was
before
the
accident
i
never
knew
a
sweeter
nature
but
she
suffered
too
much
that
what
i
always
say
when
folks
tell
me
how
she
soured
and
zeena
she
was
always
cranky
not
but
what
she
bears
with
mattie
wonderful
i
seen
that
myself
but
sometimes
the
two
of
them
get
going
at
each
other
and
then
ethan
face
break
your
heart
when
i
see
that
i
think
it
him
that
suffers
most
anyhow
it
ai
zeena
because
she
ai
got
the
time
it
a
pity
though
hale
ended
sighing
that
they
all
shut
up
that
one
kitchen
in
the
summertime
on
pleasant
days
they
move
mattie
into
the
parlour
or
out
in
the
and
that
makes
it
easier
but
winters
there
the
fires
to
be
thought
of
and
there
ai
a
dime
to
spare
up
at
the
fromes
hale
drew
a
deep
breath
as
though
her
memory
were
eased
of
its
long
burden
and
she
had
no
more
to
say
but
suddenly
an
impulse
of
complete
avowal
seized
her
she
took
off
her
spectacles
again
leaned
toward
me
across
the
and
went
on
with
lowered
voice
there
was
one
day
about
a
week
after
the
accident
when
they
all
thought
mattie
could
live
well
i
say
it
a
pity
she
did
i
said
it
right
out
to
our
minister
once
and
he
was
shocked
at
me
only
he
was
with
me
that
morning
when
she
first
came
to
and
i
say
if
she
ha
died
ethan
might
lived
and
the
way
they
are
now
i
do
see
there
much
difference
between
the
fromes
up
at
the
farm
and
the
fromes
down
in
the
graveyard
that
down
there
they
all
quiet
and
the
women
have
got
to
hold
their
tongues
