chapter

the
discovery
of
america
by
lord
loveland
even
the
last
resort
has
refused
me
loveland
broke
the
news
to
his
mother
when
he
had
kissed
her
miss
mecklenburg
yes
i
begin
to
realise
that
i
a
sinking
ship
the
early
rats
are
deserting
me
or
declining
to
come
on
board
clever
little
animals
you
sink
protested
lady
loveland
clasping
the
pretty
hands
whence
all
save
the
wedding
ring
and
its
guard
had
gone
to
pay
a
visit
of
indefinite
length
to
battenborough
the
idiot
to
refuse
you
with
her
too
she
did
do
it
with
her
nose
mater
val
you
know
what
i
mean
and
after
you
overlooked
her
being
a
jewess
yes
it
was
kind
of
me
was
it
an
italian
prince
has
just
overlooked
it
too
her
engagement
to
doriana
was
announced
the
morning
after
she
offered
to
be
a
sister
to
me
it
was
the
size
of
her
purse
not
her
nose
which
caught
his
eye
but
sooner
or
later
he
beat
her
i
hope
so
she
deserves
it
for
taking
him
instead
of
you
oh
val
what
a
world
do
grouse
mater
might
have
beaten
her
if
i
got
her
and
then
there
have
been
a
scandal
i
ca
stand
women
with
important
looking
teeth
and
noses
which
throw
their
other
features
into
perspective
besides
lillah
mecklenburg
is
as
young
as
painted
so
few
women
are
nowadays
dearest
sighed
lady
loveland
who
in
living
for
her
handsome
son
did
not
trouble
to
live
up
to
the
past
of
her
complexion
and
whose
way
of
doing
her
hair
was
alone
enough
to
show
that
though
lenient
to
val
weaknesses
she
would
not
condone
those
of
her
sister
women
oh
val
it
hard
you
should
have
to
think
of
such
creatures
but
what
are
we
to
do
that
just
where
i
want
your
advice
said
loveland
who
had
come
a
long
way
to
get
it
for
the
distance
from
london
to
the
north
of
scotland
is
formidable
when
birds
are
out
of
season
lady
loveland
was
flattered
that
val
should
ask
for
her
advice
which
when
offered
gratuitously
he
had
never
been
known
to
take
my
advice
she
echoed
sadly
that
all
i
can
give
you
now
although
i
did
hope
dear
boy
i
must
confess
i
i
have
been
trying
for
limericks
it
was
for
your
sake
and
i
hoped
to
win
large
sums
i
thought
of
lines
all
night
long
and
i
did
send
in
some
splendid
ones
a
thousand
times
better
than
those
for
which
other
people
dreadful
people
my
dear
with
names
like
hogson
and
dobbs
have
won
hundreds
of
pounds
i
gave
the
editors
permission
to
my
too
one
would
have
thought
a
valuable
advertisement
for
their
papers
but
all
won
after
the
greatest
efforts
has
been
fifteen
and
six
an
insult
while
these
dobbs
and
hogsons
i
believe
the
editors
must
be
and
the
shillings
for
the
postal
orders
have
counted
up
into
pounds
i
am
crushed
with
remorse
never
mind
dear
you
meant
it
for
the
best
said
val
who
cared
more
for
his
mother
than
for
anyone
else
in
the
world
except
himself
and
that
he
made
this
exception
was
largely
lady
loveland
fault
for
she
had
brought
him
up
to
believe
in
but
one
person
of
paramount
importance
adorning
the
universe
perceval
george
victor
edward
gordon
thirteenth
marquis
of
loveland
what
would
a
few
pounds
matter
or
a
few
hundreds
even
if
you
won
them
the
ship
too
far
under
water
to
be
raised
with
limericks
dearest
is
it
as
bad
as
that
it
as
bad
as
anything
can
be
look
out
of
your
window
at
the
snow
falling
well
that
nothing
to
the
way
it
snowing
bills
outside
my
window
if
you
and
i
ca
think
of
something
to
clear
the
weather
i
shall
have
to
chuck
the
army
and
even
if
i
do
the
bills
will
still
keep
on
snowing
what
horrible
creatures
tradesmen
must
be
said
lady
loveland
whose
opinions
had
come
down
to
her
crusted
and
from
the
cellars
of
the
stone
age
to
think
that
we
have
had
power
of
life
and
death
over
them
if
we
lived
a
few
hundred
years
ago
i
wish
those
times
could
come
back
the
world
at
large
does
agree
with
you
it
ought
to
be
at
large
replied
lady
loveland
without
the
smallest
idea
of
a
joke
it
reached
a
pretty
pass
when
worms
who
make
boots
and
uniforms
and
and
sell
wine
oh
if
you
like
and
jewellery
very
well
admit
the
jewellery
and
motors
i
wasted
a
good
deal
of
substance
in
riotous
mater
oh
i
suppose
men
of
your
position
have
some
right
to
enjoy
their
lives
as
i
was
saying
it
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
worms
who
make
or
sell
what
every
gentleman
have
things
that
ought
simply
to
come
like
the
air
you
breathe
can
turn
and
rend
an
officer
of
the
guards
a
peer
of
the
realm
without
fear
of
being
crushed
if
i
chosen
to
be
a
kind
of
secret
advertising
agent
for
tradespeople
i
might
have
been
dressed
and
wined
for
nothing
too
perhaps
said
loveland
i
know
some
fellows
who
do
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
hanged
if
i
could
i
rather
blow
out
my
brains
decently
oh
my
darling
do
speak
so
wildly
implored
his
mother
there
must
be
resources
we
can
call
upon
if
we
could
only
think
of
them
i
have
called
on
several
people
resources
without
any
good
coming
of
it
loveland
grinned
faintly
though
he
was
in
the
depths
of
depression
and
had
suffered
from
insomnia
for
at
least
a
week
between
eight
and
ten
in
the
morning
when
so
popular
a
young
man
should
in
his
own
opinion
have
been
dreaming
of
last
night
pleasures
instead
of
worrying
how
to
pay
for
them
there
is
surely
a
last
resort
went
on
lady
loveland
miss
mecklenburg
was
mine
and
she
failed
me
thank
heaven
there
must
be
something
else
something
still
worse
do
be
flippant
dearest
i
ca
concentrate
my
thoughts
when
you
are
ah
if
we
could
have
let
loveland
castle
as
well
as
we
did
twelve
years
ago
it
crumbled
a
lot
since
and
we
too
poor
to
repair
ourselves
let
alone
our
castles
you
at
least
do
need
repairing
said
his
mother
gazing
at
her
son
with
admiration
you
the
handsomest
young
man
in
the
kingdom
loveland
laughed
though
he
believed
her
as
a
child
he
had
been
kissed
by
all
his
mother
prettiest
friends
because
he
was
so
absurdly
beautiful
and
so
precocious
if
he
had
been
a
plain
or
stupid
boy
he
might
have
grown
up
to
be
an
estimable
young
man
as
marquises
go
why
do
you
say
the
world
he
asked
i
not
a
woman
to
dearest
all
the
lovelands
have
been
one
has
only
to
go
into
the
picture
gallery
at
the
castle
to
see
that
yes
as
we
ca
sell
their
portraits
if
we
could
your
father
would
have
done
it
when
he
sold
the
town
house
but
you
will
be
so
confusing
val
my
argument
is
that
as
the
best
looking
and
the
cleverest
i
do
know
a
blessed
thing
my
dear
ladyship
never
had
any
education
you
ought
to
have
sent
me
to
eton
instead
of
coddling
me
up
with
tutors
and
you
did
think
so
then
i
remember
well
when
it
was
proposed
you
flung
yourself
on
the
floor
and
howled
so
of
course
that
settled
it
why
yes
you
generally
settled
things
like
that
you
had
such
a
determined
way
dear
but
you
were
knowing
more
than
many
studious
uninteresting
young
men
have
forgotten
then
your
south
african
career
it
was
like
a
romance
you
who
had
been
crammed
oh
ever
so
little
for
sandhurst
and
then
left
there
to
go
to
the
war
when
you
were
a
mere
child
hardly
nineteen
so
brave
and
then
the
thing
you
did
on
the
battlefield
of
course
you
ought
to
have
had
the
victoria
cross
but
as
it
was
the
newspapers
rang
with
your
praises
and
i
was
besieged
for
your
photographs
to
publish
that
deed
alone
would
have
made
you
a
personage
of
consideration
even
without
your
rank
i
told
you
lots
of
times
mater
the
whole
thing
was
a
sort
of
accident
i
could
bear
the
chap
if
i
stopped
to
think
i
believe
i
have
run
back
a
step
to
drag
him
out
from
under
fire
but
i
was
there
hauling
him
away
before
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
yes
you
have
told
me
and
other
people
but
no
one
believes
you
how
could
they
they
see
it
your
modesty
lord
loveland
mother
was
perhaps
the
one
person
on
earth
who
would
have
attributed
to
him
this
quality
and
as
for
disliking
the
young
man
whose
life
you
saved
at
the
risk
of
your
own
of
course
that
proves
you
all
the
more
noble
everybody
must
see
that
oh
well
it
a
jolly
good
thing
for
me
if
they
do
said
val
mechanically
passing
his
hand
over
the
scar
on
his
forehead
which
became
him
like
a
hall
mark
or
a
halo
it
together
with
the
south
african
brown
that
never
quite
faded
had
made
him
still
more
ornamental
in
the
eyes
of
the
pretty
young
married
women
with
whom
he
was
popular
also
in
the
eyes
of
girls
who
liked
to
dance
and
flirt
with
lord
loveland
even
though
they
preferred
to
marry
dukes
and
princes
but
what
are
you
working
up
to
so
elaborately
mater
to
your
prospects
there
no
young
man
so
liked
and
wanted
everywhere
oh
i
fair
at
polo
i
can
ride
straight
and
shoot
a
bit
said
loveland
with
a
pretence
at
he
was
far
from
feeling
i
get
asked
to
all
the
amusing
house
parties
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
stopping
at
such
places
is
a
lot
more
expensive
than
swaggering
about
at
the
most
expensive
hotels
in
europe
i
know
dearest
sighed
the
devoted
lady
who
by
industrious
spoiling
had
made
him
what
he
was
i
was
only
going
on
to
say
that
you
a
personage
of
importance
never
think
you
not
as
for
the
two
or
three
wretched
girls
who
have
hurled
themselves
at
the
heads
of
princes
when
they
might
have
had
you
why
our
english
heiresses
are
growing
disgustingly
conceited
and
ambitious
quite
unmaidenly
and
let
regret
their
mistakes
you
need
val
you
want
my
advice
well
had
an
inspiration
i
do
believe
a
real
inspiration
do
you
go
to
america
to
try
ranching
good
heavens
no
my
son
to
try
marrying
in
america
you
succeed
brilliantly
why
not
run
over
and
see
what
there
is
she
spoke
as
if
to
see
meant
to
have
notwithstanding
certain
failures
nearer
home
but
loveland
sense
of
humour
which
had
a
real
existence
did
not
always
bestir
itself
when
his
own
affairs
were
in
question
when
things
come
too
close
to
the
eye
one
is
apt
to
lose
the
point
of
view
and
loveland
did
not
laugh
at
his
mother
suggestion
oh
girls
he
said
distastefully
why
go
there
for
them
plenty
come
over
here
to
collect
us
ye
es
but
think
of
the
competition
there
are
still
unmarried
dukes
it
so
annoying
there
always
seem
to
be
dukes
and
foreign
who
might
better
stop
in
their
own
countries
than
prowl
about
ours
seeking
what
they
may
devour
that
what
you
propose
my
doing
in
the
states
oh
that
different
the
americans
would
be
the
foreigners
not
you
they
do
look
on
themselves
in
that
light
let
them
look
at
you
the
girls
i
mean
in
light
there
on
their
native
heath
where
practically
no
competition
can
exist
for
who
ever
heard
of
an
american
heiress
marrying
an
american
man
i
suppose
it
must
happen
sometimes
said
val
it
never
in
the
newspapers
no
dearest
i
believe
that
is
why
according
to
statistics
there
are
so
many
more
men
than
women
in
the
states
the
girls
marry
our
men
and
really
some
of
them
are
quite
presentable
if
any
one
of
three
or
four
beautiful
and
charming
duchesses
had
heard
the
tone
in
which
old
lady
loveland
said
this
she
would
have
laughed
or
sneered
according
to
her
mood
do
you
know
many
americans
val
his
mother
went
on
thoughtfully
hardly
any
except
jim
harborough
and
er
his
cousin
who
has
married
stanforth
this
was
another
instance
of
a
misguided
young
woman
who
preferred
a
duke
to
the
marquis
therefore
she
remained
nameless
between
mother
and
son
harborough
would
i
suppose
give
you
letters
of
introduction
to
the
right
people
over
there
oh
yes
i
suppose
he
would
he
does
approve
of
me
but
he
refuse
letters
to
his
wife
cousin
does
approve
of
you
indeed
what
impertinence
but
perhaps
jealous
and
thinks
you
were
once
in
love
with
betty
i
feared
it
myself
before
she
paid
that
visit
to
the
states
which
turned
out
such
a
success
just
as
i
sure
yours
would
if
you
went
i
never
was
in
love
with
betty
first
cousins
are
a
bit
too
near
to
be
interesting
one
generally
known
them
since
the
stage
when
they
were
silly
over
dolls
besides
betty
looks
too
much
like
me
i
do
care
for
girls
it
just
as
well
you
did
care
for
betty
such
a
marriage
would
have
been
disastrous
but
she
a
sweet
girl
and
must
have
made
a
good
many
friends
in
the
states
there
was
the
young
woman
mohunsleigh
married
for
instance
i
believe
he
met
her
through
betty
oh
val
you
really
to
go
over
i
sure
you
be
the
greatest
success
perhaps
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
loveland
patronized
his
inspiration
of
course
harborough
and
betty
would
both
give
me
letters
if
i
had
to
marry
horrid
bore
at
my
age
and
could
afford
to
choose
i
take
an
english
girl
of
the
right
sort
but
americans
are
a
lot
better
than
english
ones
of
the
wrong
sort
middle
class
mushrooms
who
shot
up
in
a
night
on
the
strength
of
pale
pills
for
pink
people
or
corsets
or
disinfectants
if
a
man
a
beggar
he
must
be
content
with
the
wine
and
wives
of
the
country
where
he
begs
american
girls
no
matter
what
they
sprung
from
seem
adaptable
and
anyhow
people
are
tolerant
of
any
queer
ways
they
may
have
that
true
agreed
lady
loveland
who
had
never
in
her
life
spoken
to
an
american
girl
but
was
now
eager
to
become
dowager
for
the
sake
of
a
desirable
one
if
you
went
to
new
york
or
somewhere
you
see
enough
girls
to
feel
you
were
picking
out
the
best
oh
you
would
virtually
have
a
clear
coast
and
judging
from
novels
i
read
everybody
in
american
society
would
be
fighting
for
the
honour
of
entertaining
you
racking
their
brains
to
get
up
the
most
wonderful
spectacles
for
your
amusement
they
would
amuse
me
said
loveland
in
the
way
he
had
cultivated
since
he
came
back
a
wounded
hero
of
nineteen
in
the
last
year
of
the
south
african
war
i
should
be
there
purely
on
business
but
though
he
spoke
like
a
tired
man
of
forty
rather
than
a
happy
and
healthy
one
of
or
seven
he
was
beginning
to
lean
towards
his
mother
advice
he
could
easily
get
long
leave
he
had
a
couple
of
months
due
to
him
during
a
tour
of
inspection
in
the
states
he
would
be
free
from
all
the
bills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
as
he
would
have
no
settled
address
until
the
business
that
took
him
over
was
settled
after
that
when
his
engagement
was
published
in
the
papers
tradesmen
would
hold
their
hands
it
ought
to
take
you
many
weeks
lady
loveland
was
reflecting
aloud
if
you
went
at
the
right
season
and
to
the
right
place
the
season
is
different
for
different
places
over
there
betty
says
remarked
loveland
who
now
having
discovered
america
as
a
spot
worthy
of
note
on
the
world
map
was
ready
to
explain
it
to
his
mother
how
odd
exclaimed
lady
loveland
to
whom
all
things
were
odd
and
scarcely
proper
if
they
were
not
as
in
great
britain
but
oh
of
course
you
only
mean
that
they
go
to
one
place
to
shoot
at
a
certain
time
to
another
to
hunt
at
a
different
time
as
we
do
not
exactly
that
i
think
said
val
getting
out
of
his
element
i
believe
it
something
to
do
with
the
thermometer
betty
went
in
summer
and
was
obliged
to
stop
at
newport
one
reads
things
about
newport
yes
though
i
forget
what
replied
his
mother
dismissing
newport
but
in
the
states
there
must
be
heiresses
abounding
in
great
quantities
everywhere
as
all
american
girls
appear
to
be
rich
in
more
or
less
degrees
they
flock
to
europe
from
towns
with
the
most
extraordinary
names
i
do
know
why
it
happened
to
stick
in
my
memory
but
i
know
there
was
one
oshkosh
or
something
truly
awful
of
that
sort
a
young
person
from
there
with
millions
actually
millions
married
the
marquise
de
merpoule
third
son
if
you
remember
a
most
unprepossessing
youth
whose
face
looked
like
an
i
hardly
think
i
should
have
to
go
as
far
afield
as
oshkosh
wherever
it
may
be
said
loveland
glancing
at
his
double
in
the
mirror
where
was
reflected
also
the
worn
furnishing
of
his
mother
with
a
pang
he
saw
the
sorry
background
and
forgot
himself
for
a
moment
in
thinking
of
loveland
castle
a
very
noble
dull
palace
all
marble
gold
plate
portraits
and
precedence
when
in
its
prime
echoing
sadness
now
until
such
time
as
the
heir
might
redeem
it
with
some
fair
dollars
the
murmur
of
those
echoes
depressed
him
as
did
the
white
whirl
of
snow
veiling
the
windows
of
the
shooting
lodge
whither
lady
loveland
had
retired
to
live
upon
nothing
that
he
might
have
something
but
his
mother
was
happy
in
prophetic
thoughts
of
a
future
when
val
should
have
saved
his
own
and
the
family
fortunes
of
course
you
wo
need
to
go
to
oshkosh
she
said
very
likely
they
have
or
red
indians
there
i
only
meant
that
if
there
could
be
millions
in
a
town
with
such
a
name
what
must
there
be
in
others
more
important
and
easier
to
get
at
i
stick
to
the
important
ones
that
are
easy
to
get
at
that
means
you
are
making
up
your
mind
to
go
it
practically
made
up
thanks
to
you
mater
i
believe
in
quick
decisions
how
like
your
father
after
selling
the
house
in
grosvenor
square
he
made
up
his
mind
in
ten
minutes
to
go
to
monte
carlo
and
do
compare
that
decision
with
this
for
heaven
sake
it
be
lucky
no
dearest
said
lady
loveland
meekly
her
delicate
nose
reddening
with
reminiscences
well
then
it
quite
settled
i
feel
it
for
the
best
and
i
can
trust
you
to
bring
me
a
to
be
well
not
to
be
of
i
promise
you
anyhow
she
sha
disgrace
you
by
her
manners
or
me
by
her
looks
after
i
gone
so
far
to
get
her
why
you
might
find
something
that
would
do
on
the
ship
which
would
save
so
much
time
and
trouble
exclaimed
lady
loveland
brightening
you
could
marry
immediately
on
landing
and
yet
perhaps
it
would
be
foolish
to
do
anything
irrevocable
until
you
looked
to
see
what
there
was
in
new
york
you
must
be
reckless
when
so
much
depends
upon
prudence
still
it
would
be
wise
to
sail
on
a
good
ship
where
you
might
meet
millionairesses
that
would
be
only
an
ordinary
precaution
it
would
be
an
ordinary
price
said
loveland
we
must
manage
it
somehow
and
a
good
cabin
you
owe
that
to
your
position
i
owe
so
much
already
i
may
as
well
owe
a
little
more
val
dear
i
asked
you
not
to
joke
it
confuses
me
and
i
need
to
concentrate
all
my
ideas
upon
one
point
let
me
see
yes
pink
pearls
the
pink
what
asked
loveland
startled
i
still
have
them
the
double
rope
you
know
i
know
another
beastly
heirloom
still
one
can
pawn
heirlooms
your
bride
can
redeem
it
and
the
other
things
i
always
saved
the
pink
pearls
for
a
great
emergency
this
a
great
emergency
battenborough
ought
to
give
seven
or
eight
hundred
and
though
seven
or
eight
hundred
as
you
say
would
go
far
among
the
debts
they
might
send
you
to
america
and
back
i
have
to
throw
a
few
sops
to
cerberus
if
i
want
new
clothes
to
impress
the
american
girls
laughed
val
that
brute
deedes
wo
give
me
so
much
as
a
waistcoat
unless
he
gets
something
on
account
pay
him
something
said
lady
loveland
pay
what
you
must
keep
what
you
can
for
yourself
as
for
me
i
want
nothing
except
a
rich
finished
her
son
his
spirits
rising
though
the
snow
still
fell
after
all
it
was
only
october
and
there
was
sunshine
elsewhere
in
america
perhaps
it
was
now
shining
on
his
bride
to
be
i
write
to
betty
about
the
letters
he
said
after
you
given
me
some
tea
chapter
two
between
betty
and
jim
one
of
loveland
most
easily
detected
virtues
was
his
careless
habit
of
telling
the
truth
he
had
never
lied
or
even
fibbed
whitely
as
a
small
boy
an
idiosyncrasy
which
had
often
seriously
inconvenienced
his
mother
and
other
relations
whose
pet
failings
or
economies
he
had
ruthlessly
exposed
but
lady
betty
bulkeley
had
always
maintained
that
this
bold
truthfulness
of
her
cousin
was
the
result
of
inconsiderateness
rather
than
nobility
of
soul
she
said
and
she
ought
to
have
known
as
she
had
been
acquainted
with
him
since
she
was
two
and
he
eight
years
old
that
he
did
not
bother
to
think
of
polite
fibs
simply
because
the
feelings
of
others
were
not
for
him
of
enough
importance
to
seem
worth
saving
at
the
cost
of
mental
effort
besides
according
to
betty
val
took
an
impish
delight
in
shocking
people
as
for
blurting
out
the
truth
about
his
own
affairs
the
habit
sprang
from
that
impishness
in
idle
moods
and
a
sublime
indifference
to
public
opinion
in
serious
states
of
mind
now
in
his
letter
to
betty
asking
for
introductions
he
made
no
attempt
to
cover
his
real
intentions
with
the
roses
of
pretty
fiction
he
let
it
appear
plainly
that
he
thought
his
cousin
having
visited
america
and
snatched
a
millionaire
from
the
matrimonial
ought
gladly
to
help
him
succeed
in
the
same
game
the
wretch
said
betty
in
the
midst
of
reading
loveland
brutally
frank
letter
to
jim
her
american
trophy
i
believe
he
has
the
impudence
to
think
i
married
you
for
money
i
like
to
shake
him
and
box
his
silly
conceited
ears
they
may
be
silly
and
conceited
but
they
exactly
the
shape
of
yours
darling
so
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
box
them
no
matter
how
much
good
it
might
do
their
owner
said
jim
harborough
who
had
been
betty
husband
for
nearly
a
year
and
was
joyously
watching
her
triumphs
as
a
young
married
woman
naturally
betty
kissed
him
for
this
speech
as
they
were
at
breakfast
alone
together
the
servants
banished
well
anyway
we
wo
give
him
the
letters
she
said
when
she
had
gone
back
to
her
own
place
not
far
away
wo
we
asked
jim
with
a
thoughtful
air
no
certainly
not
returned
betty
i
like
your
and
i
wo
deliberately
let
loveland
loose
to
prey
upon
them
i
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
said
jim
putting
on
his
yankiest
accent
i
do
know
some
of
them
might
fall
in
love
with
him
suggested
betty
doubtfully
he
awfully
with
a
kind
of
winning
boyish
way
and
a
voice
that
far
too
nice
to
express
him
really
one
often
feels
too
lenient
with
val
as
if
he
were
one
of
one
own
pet
weaknesses
come
alive
and
walking
about
as
for
his
looks
he
more
like
you
than
your
own
brother
is
said
jim
eyes
dimples
curly
hair
and
all
so
you
would
want
me
to
hate
him
would
you
and
as
for
his
voice
it
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
it
expresses
something
in
his
self
the
hidden
self
that
he
and
nobody
else
knows
anything
about
the
self
he
never
had
a
chance
to
develop
or
find
out
because
his
mother
and
other
people
have
spoiled
him
from
his
babyhood
that
very
subtle
of
you
jim
as
well
as
very
kind
and
like
you
said
betty
i
wish
i
could
think
it
true
as
he
my
cousin
but
thank
goodness
i
for
one
never
spoiled
him
i
scratched
his
face
once
when
i
was
a
small
girl
and
i
glad
i
wish
it
had
left
a
mark
it
would
have
been
even
a
more
honourable
scar
than
the
one
south
africa
gave
him
but
i
admit
he
is
rather
an
unlicked
cub
at
present
i
pity
the
girl
who
falls
in
love
with
him
as
he
now
is
always
was
and
probably
ever
will
be
loveland
without
end
finished
betty
flippantly
the
of
him
expecting
me
to
ask
you
for
letters
so
that
he
can
go
over
to
your
country
and
do
his
best
to
make
some
nice
american
girl
miserable
for
life
and
spend
all
her
money
i
shall
punish
him
since
i
ca
do
anything
worse
by
telling
him
exactly
what
i
think
of
him
there
are
other
ways
of
punishing
him
more
fitting
to
the
crime
perhaps
remarked
jim
thoughtfully
what
ways
giving
him
the
letters
jim
and
then
and
then
well
a
lot
depends
upon
whether
he
a
egoist
or
merely
a
made
one
i
have
quite
worked
out
the
idea
yet
it
simmering
it
soon
begin
to
boil
whether
jim
harborough
idea
had
already
boiled
or
not
at
all
events
that
same
afternoon
a
fat
envelope
went
out
by
post
registered
and
addressed
to
the
marquis
of
loveland
cragside
lodge
dorloch
b
in
it
there
were
at
least
ten
letters
of
introduction
all
to
names
the
bare
mention
of
which
had
power
to
raise
the
circulation
of
society
papers
in
america
or
create
a
flutter
in
wall
street
each
envelope
enclosed
in
the
big
one
was
left
open
so
that
loveland
might
acquaint
himself
with
the
terms
in
which
his
cousins
described
him
to
their
millionaire
friends
perhaps
he
was
slightly
aggrieved
that
they
did
not
paint
him
in
more
glowing
terms
or
dwell
upon
the
honour
conferred
on
the
recipients
of
the
letters
but
there
was
no
real
fault
to
find
and
as
jim
would
perhaps
have
said
it
was
up
to
loveland
to
make
his
own
impression
on
the
whole
val
was
satisfied
with
what
he
had
got
and
condescendingly
wrote
two
lines
of
thanks
to
betty
chapter
three
the
inestimable
foxham
times
were
bad
said
battenborough
the
polite
and
popular
pawnbroker
therefore
lady
loveland
got
only
six
hundred
pounds
on
the
pink
pearls
two
hundred
were
sprinkled
about
among
val
creditors
like
pepper
out
of
a
pot
where
such
seasoning
was
necessary
a
hundred
more
were
spent
outright
with
heartburnings
upon
obstinate
tailors
hatters
and
hosiers
who
would
not
tail
hat
nor
hose
except
upon
instalments
of
ready
money
fifty
pounds
were
apologetically
retained
by
lady
loveland
who
grudged
every
penny
to
herself
and
especially
to
her
servants
another
fifty
a
little
more
than
paid
for
a
cabin
almost
worthy
of
his
lordship
on
the
big
ship
fifty
and
some
vague
dust
of
gold
and
silver
went
into
val
pocket
for
current
expenses
and
the
remaining
hundred
and
fifty
condensed
into
the
form
of
a
letter
of
credit
of
course
there
ought
to
have
been
more
much
more
but
there
would
have
been
less
had
not
loveland
man
foxham
given
notice
at
the
last
moment
this
inestimable
person
assured
his
master
that
nothing
but
the
most
urgent
necessity
could
have
induced
him
to
take
such
a
course
he
suffered
poignantly
foxham
intimated
with
proper
respect
in
the
idea
that
another
must
perform
for
his
lordship
those
services
which
had
been
his
pleasure
and
duty
but
foxham
grandfather
had
died
even
valets
have
grandfathers
leaving
a
tidy
sum
and
as
there
were
peculiarities
in
the
will
foxham
would
lose
his
chance
of
inheriting
if
he
left
england
loveland
privately
thought
it
almost
equivalent
to
that
his
man
should
desert
him
for
such
a
selfish
trifle
as
private
interest
but
he
would
have
scorned
to
retain
a
servant
who
wished
to
leave
him
besides
there
were
advantages
in
losing
even
such
a
treasure
as
foxham
before
the
two
passages
were
taken
val
had
learned
from
a
friend
that
if
you
sent
your
valet
second
class
you
were
not
able
to
command
his
services
on
shipboard
this
seemed
a
disgusting
waste
of
money
and
ought
to
be
protested
against
in
or
somewhere
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
afford
a
fare
for
foxham
i
dare
say
i
can
get
some
fellow
over
there
if
everything
goes
well
said
he
meanwhile
i
shall
save
money
on
old
fox
he
has
opened
his
mouth
about
wages
jolly
impudent
if
he
had
because
of
course
he
knows
i
pay
up
when
its
convenient
and
anyhow
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
letter
of
credit
is
the
least
i
can
rub
along
with
on
the
other
side
i
must
sharp
as
harborough
says
and
pick
up
the
right
girl
so
as
to
get
everything
in
shape
as
soon
as
possible
or
i
may
find
myself
in
a
mess
do
imagine
anything
so
horrid
darling
said
lady
loveland
anxious
to
prop
up
her
son
spirits
as
well
as
his
credit
think
only
of
the
best
but
i
sorry
about
foxham
he
turns
you
out
so
perfectly
oh
i
learned
to
shift
for
myself
like
a
regular
navvy
in
south
africa
loveland
consoled
her
a
chap
has
to
keep
clean
and
have
the
right
folds
in
his
trousers
whatever
happens
and
i
worried
along
somehow
without
disgracing
the
family
i
can
do
the
same
now
though
it
be
a
bore
especially
till
i
get
used
to
it
again
thus
the
pink
pearl
money
was
apportioned
a
little
here
and
a
little
there
and
made
to
go
as
far
as
possible
foxham
stopped
with
his
lordship
till
after
the
return
to
london
doing
the
final
packing
and
all
his
ordinary
work
as
usual
without
a
greedy
word
as
to
arrears
of
wages
perhaps
this
was
due
to
an
angelic
disposition
or
perhaps
he
guessed
the
motive
of
his
master
errand
and
was
willing
to
speculate
on
the
result
but
loveland
took
the
devotion
for
granted
without
going
too
deeply
into
causes
on
getting
back
to
his
quarters
near
wellington
barracks
val
was
somewhat
surprised
to
receive
a
visit
from
harborough
who
had
never
come
to
call
on
him
before
so
you
got
your
leave
i
hear
and
are
sailing
for
my
blessed
country
in
a
few
days
jim
remarked
loveland
replied
that
this
was
the
case
and
happened
to
think
of
thanking
jim
for
his
letters
of
introduction
harborough
answered
casually
that
that
was
all
right
and
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
read
in
a
paper
or
heard
from
a
man
that
loveland
had
taken
his
passage
on
the
yes
said
val
i
wanted
to
go
over
on
a
good
ship
well
the
a
ripping
one
could
be
a
better
jim
admitted
but
i
should
have
thought
you
have
the
curiosity
to
try
the
newest
thing
the
said
loveland
do
suppose
i
could
have
got
a
passage
on
her
for
the
next
three
or
four
trips
across
perhaps
could
said
jim
but
i
can
get
you
one
why
she
sails
tomorrow
does
she
asked
val
yes
said
jim
but
you
can
go
on
her
if
you
like
with
a
good
cabin
too
all
to
yourself
my
passage
is
paid
for
on
the
and
my
name
on
her
passenger
list
said
loveland
well
it
too
late
to
have
your
name
printed
on
the
passenger
list
or
perhaps
to
get
back
your
money
for
the
said
jim
but
that
need
stand
in
your
way
you
wo
have
to
pay
for
your
cabin
on
the
it
going
begging
a
friend
of
mine
who
ca
sail
has
given
his
ticket
to
me
to
do
with
as
i
like
but
as
a
man
whose
movements
make
things
in
wall
street
jump
up
and
down
like
a
he
does
want
it
known
that
he
got
to
stay
behind
because
he
seedy
that
all
if
you
want
to
go
in
his
place
go
and
say
nothing
till
you
get
on
the
other
side
by
that
time
he
be
on
his
way
on
a
following
ship
at
least
that
what
he
hopes
do
you
mean
that
if
i
want
to
cross
in
the
i
must
pass
under
your
friend
name
asked
loveland
beginning
to
look
haughty
for
though
he
was
tempted
by
the
offer
he
did
not
think
that
another
man
name
was
worthy
of
his
wearing
even
for
five
days
he
would
as
willingly
have
appeared
in
bond
street
in
a
coat
oh
no
nothing
of
the
sort
answered
jim
harborough
smiling
his
pleasant
smile
what
i
meant
was
do
go
advertising
the
fact
that
you
got
henry
vanderpot
cabin
because
he
not
well
enough
to
sail
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
swagger
about
as
if
you
meant
to
be
a
passenger
on
the
from
the
beginning
of
things
loveland
was
prepared
to
do
any
amount
of
swaggering
though
he
did
not
say
so
to
jim
or
indeed
acknowledge
it
to
himself
he
replied
that
if
this
were
the
only
condition
he
would
accept
the
ticket
and
instruct
foxham
as
he
would
not
have
time
himself
to
try
and
sell
the
passage
which
he
had
paid
for
on
the
fox
have
several
days
to
do
it
in
and
i
tell
him
if
he
brings
it
off
there
ten
per
cent
for
himself
said
val
meanwhile
i
be
enjoying
myself
on
the
meanwhile
you
be
enjoying
yourself
on
the
echoed
jim
i
suppose
there
are
sure
to
be
a
lot
of
millionaires
on
board
suggested
val
sure
to
be
even
at
this
time
of
year
with
pretty
daughters
loveland
tone
and
air
in
making
this
addition
were
so
conceited
that
jim
would
have
wanted
to
kick
him
if
he
had
not
looked
so
ridiculously
like
jim
own
adored
and
beautiful
betty
besides
the
scar
showed
white
on
the
brown
this
had
been
a
brave
boy
jim
was
inclined
to
believe
that
he
was
worth
reforming
with
pretty
daughters
harborough
repeated
his
tone
quiet
though
his
eyes
showed
a
danger
signal
however
be
prudent
do
make
up
your
mind
too
soon
the
best
fish
are
always
caught
in
the
deep
sea
one
waits
to
have
a
look
round
the
markets
loveland
grinned
thank
you
for
the
tip
i
wo
forget
not
likely
that
you
hold
yourself
too
cheap
eh
jim
could
not
resist
that
one
dig
in
spite
of
the
scar
and
betty
laugh
in
the
blue
eyes
between
their
black
fringes
but
val
did
not
see
the
joke
as
he
assuredly
would
if
it
had
been
aimed
at
anybody
else
jim
having
married
into
the
family
ought
to
uphold
the
family
pride
and
loveland
doubted
not
that
he
did
rather
not
he
returned
patronizingly
you
need
be
afraid
my
dear
chap
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
me
for
this
cabin
and
though
it
a
bit
short
notice
that
ca
be
helped
foxham
will
get
me
off
somehow
you
hardly
have
time
to
let
people
know
your
change
of
plan
said
jim
but
of
course
if
you
do
mind
a
little
expense
you
can
marconi
to
lady
loveland
from
the
ship
of
course
assented
lady
loveland
son
who
would
not
have
thought
of
the
attention
had
it
not
been
suggested
to
him
but
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
perhaps
not
said
jim
chapter
four
lord
loveland
makes
a
start
loveland
only
experience
of
sea
life
except
for
a
little
yachting
had
been
in
going
out
to
and
returning
from
south
africa
but
he
had
learned
to
take
care
of
himself
on
shipboard
and
though
his
name
was
not
on
the
passenger
list
of
the
his
deck
chair
was
soon
placed
by
an
attentive
steward
in
a
sheltered
corner
nearly
amidship
this
advantage
was
secured
by
a
tempting
tip
a
tip
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
giver
resources
but
then
there
were
many
people
on
the
who
came
on
board
more
like
clients
returning
to
a
hotel
where
they
had
been
known
by
the
management
for
years
than
passengers
travelling
on
a
new
ship
and
loveland
did
not
intend
to
be
defeated
in
an
unequal
competition
he
wanted
the
best
of
everything
on
this
trip
and
felt
that
money
would
be
well
spent
in
obtaining
it
he
always
did
feel
this
when
he
had
any
money
or
credit
to
spend
possibly
he
might
have
economized
coin
by
parading
his
title
but
though
spoiled
and
conceited
he
was
also
a
gentleman
and
while
he
might
trade
upon
his
position
for
the
matrimonial
market
would
not
flaunt
it
gratuitously
he
considered
he
would
be
giving
value
for
value
taking
a
girl
dollars
and
making
her
a
marchioness
but
he
thought
too
much
of
himself
to
put
on
side
when
the
politely
asked
if
he
wished
to
use
a
visiting
card
as
a
val
told
him
to
write
the
name
of
loveland
on
a
slip
of
paper
or
a
luggage
label
anything
would
do
so
the
steward
did
as
he
was
bidden
ignorant
that
he
served
a
lord
loveland
did
not
feel
that
he
needed
cheap
advertisement
it
would
soon
leak
out
that
he
was
a
personage
and
sure
enough
it
did
when
he
had
discreetly
explained
to
the
purser
his
possession
of
cabin
the
news
of
the
change
went
round
from
steward
to
steward
and
was
promptly
spotted
as
a
by
the
greatest
gossip
on
the
ship
who
happened
to
inhabit
the
stateroom
opposite
major
cadwallader
hunter
a
retired
major
of
course
he
would
not
have
had
time
to
develop
his
qualities
while
on
the
active
list
was
told
that
he
had
loveland
for
a
neighbour
and
looked
at
the
cabin
door
with
kindling
interest
being
himself
he
had
studied
the
passenger
list
as
a
collector
of
antiques
is
wont
to
study
the
announcements
of
sales
he
could
have
rattled
off
by
heart
all
the
names
worth
rattling
and
he
was
certain
that
lord
loveland
had
not
been
among
them
major
cadwallader
hunter
was
an
american
of
a
type
laughed
at
by
the
best
of
his
own
countrymen
he
knew
his
burke
and
debrett
better
than
many
an
englishman
even
of
that
middle
class
which
can
afford
to
be
ignorant
of
no
detail
concerning
the
aristocracy
he
was
aware
that
there
existed
a
marquis
of
loveland
who
was
young
and
unmarried
he
knew
all
about
his
family
connections
and
he
wondered
how
such
an
important
gentleman
had
strayed
on
board
the
unheralded
i
suppose
this
fellow
must
be
loveland
of
course
he
said
to
himself
but
why
not
be
published
frankly
on
the
passenger
list
can
there
be
a
secret
at
this
moment
loveland
walked
out
from
his
stateroom
having
come
below
for
pipe
and
he
caught
major
cadwallader
hunter
staring
at
his
door
and
gave
him
a
brief
yet
supercilious
glance
to
some
men
it
would
have
seemed
an
offensive
glance
but
major
cadwallader
hunter
was
not
to
be
easily
offended
by
a
man
he
wished
to
know
he
disappeared
into
his
own
cabin
by
way
of
proving
that
he
was
a
neighbour
not
a
paul
pry
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
on
deck
ambling
amiably
from
one
group
of
acquaintances
to
another
and
dexterously
avoiding
detrimentals
cadwallader
hunter
aspired
to
be
a
leader
of
society
he
was
one
of
those
strange
beings
heraldic
rampant
disregardant
who
are
born
snobs
in
spite
of
good
birth
and
good
breeding
therefore
he
was
not
a
genuine
article
since
no
snob
can
be
genuine
but
had
moulded
himself
into
a
thing
of
airs
and
affectations
nevertheless
he
managed
to
impress
most
people
and
some
who
were
those
who
did
not
live
in
new
york
believed
him
to
be
of
consequence
in
that
city
and
the
paris
always
reported
his
comings
and
goings
he
was
a
thin
man
of
middle
age
with
a
smile
a
high
nose
and
a
high
voice
eyeglasses
giving
glitter
to
pale
cold
eyes
a
waxed
moustache
a
carefully
cultivated
english
accent
and
a
marvellous
fund
of
scandalous
anecdotes
concerning
everyone
about
whom
it
was
worth
while
to
be
scandalous
he
had
at
least
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
all
the
richest
americans
on
board
and
he
mixed
with
his
greetings
here
and
there
a
careless
do
you
know
we
have
lord
loveland
on
the
ship
the
marquis
of
loveland
such
a
young
man
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
distinguished
peerages
in
england
family
of
soldiers
since
the
dark
ages
though
the
less
said
about
some
of
them
since
the
days
of
the
georges
the
better
this
boy
not
so
bad
as
some
of
the
old
boys
before
him
not
to
be
despised
by
eh
do
i
know
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
cadwallader
hunter
could
count
his
acquaintances
in
the
british
peerage
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
and
have
a
thumb
to
spare
for
it
is
the
genuine
unaffected
typical
americans
or
else
the
heavily
gilded
and
ones
whom
english
people
like
to
know
but
this
question
was
bound
to
come
he
had
led
up
to
it
and
was
prepared
do
i
know
him
why
in
a
way
we
connections
by
marriage
you
must
remember
pretty
lady
betty
bulkeley
who
took
us
all
by
storm
a
year
or
two
ago
sister
of
the
duke
of
stanforth
jimmy
harborough
whom
she
married
is
i
believe
a
cousin
of
mine
and
lady
betty
and
lord
loveland
are
related
so
you
see
and
for
fear
that
they
should
see
something
that
he
did
not
wish
them
to
see
he
pottered
away
to
get
at
loveland
before
anyone
could
possibly
have
the
chance
to
find
out
that
they
two
were
strangers
meanwhile
loveland
had
not
been
wasting
time
he
thought
that
jim
harborough
hint
about
deep
sea
fish
was
a
wise
one
wiser
than
he
would
have
expected
from
harborough
still
there
was
no
harm
in
keeping
his
eyes
open
and
having
kept
them
open
from
the
first
moment
after
coming
on
board
he
had
discovered
several
very
pretty
girls
with
a
certain
amount
of
eagerness
rather
as
one
looks
at
one
cards
when
beginning
a
new
rubber
of
bridge
he
glanced
over
the
hoping
that
some
of
the
names
might
be
identical
with
those
on
his
letters
of
introduction
but
there
were
no
such
coincidences
and
he
unluckily
was
too
ignorant
of
american
society
to
know
which
of
his
fellow
passengers
were
most
important
however
he
made
up
his
mind
that
one
of
the
first
things
to
do
was
to
find
out
sure
of
his
chair
on
which
the
name
of
loveland
already
appeared
in
the
steward
handwriting
he
paced
up
and
down
and
all
round
the
deck
pipe
in
mouth
and
hands
in
pockets
it
was
a
november
day
of
indian
summer
warmth
the
huge
ship
felt
no
impulse
from
the
waves
which
fawned
upon
her
sides
and
loveland
who
had
been
bored
by
the
necessity
to
leave
his
native
land
began
suddenly
to
feel
happy
quite
boyishly
happy
a
great
many
other
people
were
parading
up
and
down
also
pretty
girls
walking
alone
or
with
parents
or
accompanied
by
youths
with
whom
they
intended
to
flirt
during
the
voyage
men
with
eyes
yet
keen
and
an
air
of
solid
importance
which
might
mean
millions
handsome
women
whom
loveland
guessed
to
be
newport
and
new
york
hostesses
pleased
to
welcome
prowling
marquesses
and
besides
these
numbers
of
vague
persons
whom
to
meet
once
was
to
forget
twice
after
half
an
hour
walk
val
had
selected
two
girls
from
the
rosebud
garden
which
he
felt
bloomed
for
his
benefit
in
this
mammoth
floating
there
were
so
many
attractive
ones
that
it
was
difficult
to
choose
yet
val
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
weeded
out
the
best
and
he
hoped
that
of
the
pair
one
might
be
the
principal
unmarried
millionairess
of
the
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
greater
contrast
between
girls
than
between
these
two
whom
lord
loveland
had
mentally
set
apart
for
himself
as
a
man
picks
out
the
most
becoming
neckties
from
a
box
on
a
shop
counter
one
who
walked
the
deck
with
an
elderly
man
whose
likeness
of
feature
proclaimed
him
her
father
was
very
tall
almost
as
tall
as
loveland
who
could
be
a
when
he
took
the
trouble
not
to
slouch
she
was
slender
in
all
the
right
places
and
rounded
in
all
the
right
places
her
waist
being
so
slim
that
she
seemed
held
together
only
by
a
spine
and
a
ligament
or
two
which
means
faultlessness
of
figure
according
to
standards
she
had
burnished
auburn
hair
and
magnificent
eyes
rimmed
with
dark
lashes
her
nose
was
aquiline
her
mouth
red
and
drooping
at
the
corners
a
combination
which
made
her
profile
closely
resemble
a
famous
photograph
of
the
empress
eugenie
in
the
prime
of
loveliness
a
number
of
the
nicest
looking
people
who
came
and
went
on
deck
seemed
glad
to
claim
acquaintance
with
this
girl
and
her
handsome
father
but
though
they
were
warmly
greeted
again
and
again
the
girl
maintained
a
cool
dignity
not
unworthy
of
betty
bulkeley
mother
the
duchess
of
stanforth
val
said
to
himself
that
the
mater
would
be
pleased
with
a
of
this
type
and
that
such
a
girl
would
never
make
her
husband
ashamed
he
could
not
imagine
falling
in
love
with
her
hard
brilliance
but
then
he
was
going
to
america
to
fall
in
love
his
intentions
were
strictly
businesslike
and
this
girl
was
bound
to
be
admired
everywhere
she
would
look
an
ideal
hostess
entertaining
house
parties
at
loveland
castle
when
her
money
had
restored
it
to
all
and
more
than
its
ancient
splendour
loveland
second
choice
might
have
been
his
first
for
some
reasons
and
in
fact
she
was
his
first
by
impulse
only
she
did
not
look
as
obviously
an
heiress
as
the
other
neither
was
she
so
obviously
a
beauty
yet
her
charm
leaped
at
the
beholder
with
the
briefest
glance
especially
if
that
beholder
were
a
man
leaped
at
him
through
his
eyes
and
thrillingly
through
his
nerves
in
a
mysterious
indescribable
curiously
interesting
way
she
was
not
very
tall
and
she
was
a
slim
slip
of
a
creature
not
in
the
least
like
a
fashion
plate
but
suggestive
of
soft
natural
curves
even
in
her
frock
if
she
had
been
and
had
asked
for
a
chance
in
the
chorus
a
theatrical
manager
would
have
found
himself
giving
it
to
her
he
hardly
knew
why
more
because
she
said
she
wanted
it
than
on
the
strength
of
her
voice
or
form
or
features
then
having
yielded
so
far
to
her
magnetism
he
would
have
said
to
himself
she
is
striking
enough
for
the
front
row
or
even
the
second
she
must
go
into
the
third
and
there
she
would
have
gone
docilely
yet
the
critics
and
all
other
men
with
eyes
would
have
picked
her
out
and
presently
she
would
have
been
more
noticed
than
the
beauties
in
the
front
row
by
and
by
when
there
arose
a
little
part
with
a
few
lines
to
speak
she
would
have
got
it
and
at
last
in
some
way
or
other
it
would
have
been
she
who
was
making
the
hit
of
the
piece
lord
loveland
did
not
say
anything
of
this
sort
to
himself
but
he
felt
a
faint
electric
shock
of
interest
every
time
they
passed
and
repassed
each
other
though
after
the
first
she
did
not
look
at
him
with
the
big
brown
eyes
that
surely
had
the
prettiest
most
bewitching
lashes
ever
seen
really
they
were
charming
eyes
if
nothing
else
were
actually
beautiful
about
the
girl
her
eyes
undoubtedly
were
exquisite
they
were
very
soft
and
no
man
could
look
into
them
even
for
half
a
second
in
passing
without
realizing
deliciously
that
they
were
a
woman
eyes
yet
they
were
not
coquettish
except
for
that
piquant
effect
of
the
curled
lashes
they
were
full
of
sympathy
and
intelligence
and
gazed
frankly
sweetly
out
at
the
world
as
if
they
could
understand
and
laugh
or
cry
at
things
which
other
commonplace
eyes
would
never
even
see
for
the
rest
she
had
the
clear
colourless
skin
which
shows
every
change
of
emotion
a
sensitive
mouth
not
too
small
for
generosity
in
the
firm
little
chin
a
cleft
which
meant
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
a
slightly
impertinent
nose
which
might
mean
anything
or
nothing
loveland
felt
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
this
girl
even
if
she
were
not
an
heiress
but
he
hoped
that
she
might
prove
to
be
one
because
it
would
be
hard
to
learn
the
wisdom
of
ceasing
to
know
her
if
she
turned
out
as
poor
as
himself
the
difficulty
in
judging
these
american
girls
val
began
to
think
as
he
watched
the
charming
review
was
that
they
all
looked
like
millionairesses
they
walked
as
if
they
were
so
used
to
being
young
persons
of
importance
that
they
graciously
waived
the
fact
of
their
own
greatness
which
means
that
they
had
the
air
of
goddesses
or
princesses
at
the
least
they
were
all
dressed
perfectly
and
groomed
perfectly
their
frocks
fitted
perfectly
and
every
detail
of
their
toilets
was
perfect
from
the
buttons
of
their
english
gloves
to
the
toes
of
their
american
boots
so
how
was
a
man
to
judge
which
were
ones
and
which
the
other
ones
val
made
up
his
mind
at
last
that
he
would
walk
no
more
but
would
sit
down
and
think
this
question
over
besides
for
some
moments
the
enchanting
girl
in
the
frock
had
ceased
to
flit
to
and
fro
therefore
he
went
towards
the
sheltered
corner
where
he
knew
his
deck
chair
was
waiting
for
him
and
to
his
extreme
surprise
found
her
comfortably
installed
in
it
chapter
five
the
girl
in
the
chair
for
a
moment
loveland
was
more
conceited
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
which
is
saying
not
a
little
he
told
himself
that
the
girl
must
have
found
out
who
he
was
and
that
this
was
her
artful
way
of
scraping
acquaintance
she
had
taken
possession
of
his
chair
with
his
name
upon
it
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
claim
his
property
and
expecting
the
conversation
which
would
be
sure
to
follow
he
was
conscious
of
a
shock
of
disappointment
in
spite
of
the
witching
curled
eyelashes
he
had
not
fancied
her
that
sort
of
obvious
flirting
girl
and
like
other
spoiled
young
men
a
conquest
which
fell
to
him
easily
was
less
worth
making
nevertheless
he
still
wanted
to
know
her
no
man
even
a
spoiled
one
could
help
wanting
to
know
a
girl
with
eyes
like
those
and
he
intended
to
go
through
the
whole
programme
which
he
believed
that
she
had
deliberately
planned
out
for
him
yet
he
wished
that
she
had
not
made
herself
so
cheap
the
chair
next
to
his
was
unoccupied
though
usurpers
were
warned
off
by
the
name
of
james
smythe
boldly
painted
in
black
letters
across
the
back
stretching
away
to
the
left
was
a
row
of
smythe
chairs
which
val
did
not
trouble
to
count
he
merely
received
the
impression
of
a
large
family
of
impending
smythes
and
was
glad
that
they
were
not
assembled
their
absence
gave
him
a
splendid
chance
to
make
the
girl
with
the
eyes
a
present
of
the
flirtation
she
encouraged
val
risking
the
avalanche
of
smythehood
which
might
overwhelm
him
at
any
instant
sat
down
in
the
empty
chair
next
to
his
own
expecting
the
girl
to
glance
up
and
down
and
flutter
the
coquettish
lashes
to
his
bewilderment
her
tactics
were
more
subtle
she
did
not
look
up
at
all
but
calmly
went
on
reading
her
book
a
volume
of
disagreeably
intellectual
suggestion
this
development
of
the
game
was
interesting
because
surprising
but
val
still
regarded
it
as
a
game
he
looked
at
the
girl
while
she
apparently
unconscious
of
or
indifferent
to
his
nearness
slowly
turned
leaf
after
leaf
she
turned
so
many
that
loveland
grew
impatient
besides
a
man
had
begun
to
walk
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
line
of
smythe
chairs
fastening
upon
him
so
baleful
an
eye
that
he
feared
at
any
instant
to
be
dispossessed
of
his
borrowed
at
last
he
decided
to
be
bold
and
wait
no
longer
what
am
i
to
do
if
james
smythe
comes
along
and
orders
me
out
he
asked
pleasantly
in
a
low
yet
conversational
tone
the
girl
glanced
up
for
the
first
time
suddenly
and
as
if
startled
she
had
the
air
of
having
been
deeply
absorbed
in
her
book
and
of
not
being
sure
that
her
neighbour
had
spoken
to
her
also
she
looked
extremely
young
and
innocent
i
said
what
am
i
to
do
if
james
smythe
comes
along
and
orders
me
out
val
repeated
that
what
i
thought
you
said
replied
the
girl
meeting
his
admiring
quizzical
eyes
with
a
somewhat
bewildered
yet
defensive
gaze
but
why
should
you
say
it
to
me
is
that
rather
of
you
asked
loveland
i
do
understand
you
at
all
said
the
girl
you
look
like
a
gentleman
so
i
suppose
you
ca
mean
to
be
rude
or
impertinent
but
if
not
you
seem
to
be
talking
nonsense
this
was
straightforward
to
say
the
least
yet
her
voice
was
so
sweet
and
girlish
with
such
a
dainty
little
drawl
in
it
that
the
rebuke
did
not
sound
as
severe
as
if
spoken
with
sharper
accents
of
course
i
do
mean
to
be
rude
or
impertinent
loveland
defended
himself
at
a
loss
for
the
next
move
in
the
game
but
i
thought
that
is
i
mean
you
know
that
my
chair
i
delighted
you
should
have
it
your
chair
echoed
the
girl
oh
you
are
mistaken
no
wonder
if
you
thought
that
i
but
even
then
you
could
have
dreamed
i
take
it
on
purpose
no
o
i
began
loveland
looking
guilty
her
eyes
were
on
him
you
did
think
so
she
exclaimed
i
see
you
did
that
was
why
you
and
yet
i
do
see
how
you
could
have
fancied
i
should
know
who
you
were
unless
are
you
a
very
famous
person
in
the
life
to
which
it
pleased
london
to
call
you
lord
loveland
laughed
rather
foolishly
but
he
reddened
a
little
which
made
him
look
boyish
so
that
the
foolishness
was
rather
engaging
i
think
you
punished
me
enough
he
said
then
you
admit
that
you
deserve
to
be
punished
perhaps
which
means
that
you
did
believe
i
took
your
chair
on
purpose
i
did
stop
to
think
said
loveland
telling
the
truth
as
usual
but
less
truculently
than
usual
you
english
are
you
the
girl
asked
looking
at
him
with
her
brown
bewildering
eyes
oh
yes
replied
loveland
in
a
tone
which
added
of
course
but
he
would
have
realised
now
if
he
had
not
been
sure
before
that
the
girl
was
genuinely
ignorant
of
his
important
identity
i
was
sure
you
were
i
suppose
you
do
understand
american
girls
very
well
or
perhaps
any
girls
yet
but
then
few
men
do
really
except
poets
or
novelists
and
you
not
a
poet
or
a
novelist
rather
not
you
speak
as
though
i
asked
if
you
were
a
do
you
despise
writers
i
be
sorry
to
be
one
would
you
he
ventured
this
question
which
if
answered
might
after
all
send
them
on
the
way
towards
a
more
friendly
understanding
but
he
seemed
destined
to
put
himself
in
the
wrong
although
the
girl
laughed
i
one
she
said
i
write
stories
you
chaffing
no
i
not
why
should
you
think
so
oh
well
because
you
do
look
as
if
you
wrote
thank
you
i
suppose
you
mean
that
for
a
compliment
but
women
who
write
are
nowadays
if
they
ever
were
well
anyhow
you
too
young
i
been
writing
stories
and
getting
them
published
too
ever
since
i
was
sixteen
that
some
years
ago
now
please
do
say
you
have
thought
it
that
would
be
too
obvious
even
for
an
average
american
idea
of
an
average
englishman
are
you
an
average
american
are
you
an
average
englishman
is
it
fair
to
answer
one
question
with
another
it
said
to
be
american
did
you
know
that
no
said
loveland
as
you
thought
i
do
know
much
about
americans
yet
i
going
over
to
the
states
to
learn
the
states
how
english
that
sounds
we
think
we
all
of
america
all
that
worth
talking
about
in
ordinary
conversation
but
by
the
way
this
is
ordinary
conversation
is
it
it
began
with
something
to
be
punished
for
on
your
part
and
a
wish
to
punish
on
mine
it
gone
on
because
being
a
writing
person
i
suppose
i
always
trying
for
new
points
of
view
at
any
cost
you
thought
i
taken
your
chair
as
if
it
were
a
point
of
view
i
believe
you
really
did
think
that
i
did
admitted
val
i
wonder
why
my
aunt
name
is
on
it
oh
said
loveland
see
went
on
the
girl
leaning
forward
and
displaying
the
label
in
the
handwriting
i
do
see
said
val
but
that
happens
to
be
my
name
loveland
yes
the
girl
blushed
brightly
and
she
was
more
attractive
than
ever
when
she
blushed
oh
how
very
odd
then
perhaps
this
your
chair
how
perfectly
horrid
she
began
to
unwind
herself
from
the
rug
which
was
wrapped
round
her
as
a
chrysalis
round
an
incipient
butterfly
please
do
get
up
loveland
tone
was
almost
imploring
do
keep
the
chair
i
want
you
to
keep
it
thank
you
very
much
but
i
do
want
to
keep
it
if
it
yours
and
i
think
now
it
probably
is
if
it
were
you
would
have
expected
to
find
it
waiting
for
you
in
this
particular
place
but
you
expected
to
find
yours
here
no
it
was
that
but
as
i
was
passing
i
saw
my
aunt
name
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
because
the
had
been
told
to
put
one
in
a
nice
sheltered
place
i
took
it
for
granted
that
this
was
hers
i
did
know
there
was
another
loveland
on
the
passenger
list
i
noticed
there
was
a
loveland
said
val
but
did
think
much
about
it
as
she
was
likely
to
turn
out
a
relation
of
mine
and
my
name
is
on
the
list
i
came
in
the
place
of
another
man
as
he
made
this
explanation
with
a
slight
pause
which
meant
the
recollection
of
his
promise
to
jim
harborough
major
cadwallader
hunter
went
by
walking
slowly
and
having
ears
heard
as
he
passed
he
was
waiting
for
his
chance
to
nobble
lord
loveland
and
afterwards
he
remembered
those
few
last
words
which
he
had
caught
he
seldom
forgot
anything
which
could
possibly
matter
even
though
it
might
be
of
seeming
insignificance
at
the
time
i
go
and
look
for
the
loveland
chair
said
the
girl
you
must
do
nothing
of
the
sort
exclaimed
val
oh
it
easy
to
see
you
an
englishman
american
men
do
order
us
about
like
that
loveland
laughed
i
did
order
you
about
i
ordered
you
to
sit
still
that
just
as
bad
you
have
the
air
of
being
used
to
give
orders
i
am
you
see
i
a
soldier
oh
what
a
relief
i
began
to
be
afraid
you
were
a
duke
loveland
had
the
unusual
sensation
of
feeling
comparatively
unimportant
when
the
girl
came
to
find
out
who
he
was
she
would
know
that
he
was
less
than
a
duke
and
if
he
had
the
air
of
being
a
duke
she
had
the
air
of
thinking
no
duke
could
possibly
be
superior
to
any
american
as
he
reflected
upon
this
extreme
point
of
view
a
appeared
and
was
summoned
by
the
girl
she
wished
to
know
the
situation
of
the
second
loveland
chair
and
which
of
the
two
was
her
aunt
which
this
gentleman
loveland
or
ought
i
to
speak
of
you
as
captain
loveland
she
broke
off
to
ask
i
not
a
captain
yet
answered
val
he
did
not
explain
that
neither
was
he
he
left
her
to
discover
that
fact
for
herself
by
and
by
as
he
hoped
she
would
discover
a
good
many
other
things
connected
with
him
because
by
this
time
he
had
quite
decided
that
be
she
rich
or
be
she
poor
he
would
see
a
good
deal
of
loveland
niece
during
the
voyage
to
new
york
afterwards
but
then
why
begin
now
to
think
of
an
afterwards
chapter
six
catspawing
when
the
chair
of
loveland
had
been
indicated
as
it
soon
was
by
a
tactless
the
girl
was
obstinate
in
her
determination
to
seek
it
val
went
with
her
carrying
the
rug
and
the
book
but
as
there
was
no
vacant
place
on
either
side
of
the
new
chair
he
was
obliged
presently
to
go
back
to
his
own
and
it
was
on
the
way
back
that
major
cadwallader
hunter
chance
came
lord
loveland
i
see
you
do
remember
me
he
began
attaching
himself
to
the
younger
man
with
an
air
of
should
auld
acquaintance
be
forgot
in
the
bend
of
his
back
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
that
his
words
might
not
be
heard
by
any
curious
ears
then
he
hurried
on
lest
loveland
should
deny
him
with
undesirable
frankness
quite
natural
you
should
remember
which
indeed
it
was
as
they
had
never
come
within
miles
of
each
other
but
i
feel
i
some
right
to
remind
you
of
my
existence
because
we
connected
in
a
way
i
am
major
cadwallader
hunter
never
heard
the
name
in
my
life
said
loveland
rudely
he
thought
that
his
uninvited
companion
looked
like
a
bore
and
he
had
never
yet
suffered
a
bore
gladly
a
flash
of
reflection
told
him
that
he
possessed
no
envelope
in
jim
or
betty
handwriting
addressed
to
major
cadwallader
hunter
the
fellow
would
hardly
be
so
mildly
ingratiating
if
he
were
a
millionaire
with
daughters
to
guard
and
val
resented
a
claim
of
connection
cadwallader
hunter
could
swallow
a
snub
with
a
smile
but
never
would
he
forgive
the
snubber
he
smiled
now
but
if
lord
loveland
had
not
been
lord
loveland
i
a
distant
relative
of
jimmy
harborough
he
explained
and
i
generally
run
over
to
london
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
season
jim
seems
to
be
as
popular
on
your
side
the
water
as
on
his
own
loveland
did
not
trouble
himself
to
reply
if
jim
had
thought
this
alleged
relative
an
interesting
or
profitable
person
for
him
to
know
the
name
of
major
cadwallader
hunter
would
probably
have
been
on
one
of
the
introduction
envelopes
undismayed
by
the
chilling
silence
cadwallader
hunter
still
walked
by
lord
loveland
side
and
prattled
his
next
sentence
hinted
that
he
possessed
in
some
degree
the
quality
of
clairvoyance
i
suppose
jim
given
you
lots
of
letters
he
continued
but
it
not
likely
there
one
to
me
i
a
mere
bachelor
and
therefore
must
take
a
back
place
jim
would
naturally
send
you
to
married
people
with
big
houses
of
their
own
where
they
can
entertain
you
still
in
my
own
small
way
i
can
be
useful
to
strangers
and
should
be
glad
to
be
useful
to
you
because
in
my
eyes
you
do
seem
quite
a
stranger
i
am
by
the
by
a
great
admirer
of
your
cousin
charming
lady
betty
and
if
allow
me
to
say
so
there
a
strong
family
resemblance
between
you
major
cadwallader
hunter
had
been
out
of
america
during
betty
visit
but
had
seen
her
photograph
if
this
is
your
first
time
on
our
side
you
do
know
the
ropes
yet
and
you
must
let
me
tell
you
anything
you
care
to
hear
about
people
about
places
about
hotels
about
the
sights
should
you
want
to
see
them
i
can
begin
for
instance
by
telling
you
who
is
who
on
this
ship
there
are
several
of
our
millionaires
loveland
handsome
young
face
lost
its
frozen
stare
he
had
taken
a
dislike
to
cadwallader
hunter
but
it
was
not
so
serious
a
dislike
that
he
could
not
bury
it
he
wanted
to
know
several
things
which
this
man
might
be
able
to
tell
but
most
of
all
he
wanted
to
know
about
the
niece
of
loveland
as
he
confessed
to
her
he
had
passed
over
the
coincidence
of
names
with
indifference
when
idly
noting
it
on
the
thinking
that
the
existence
of
a
loveland
could
not
concern
the
marquis
of
that
ilk
now
however
if
this
officious
sort
of
person
could
prove
that
the
lady
sprang
from
the
same
stock
be
she
no
matter
how
remote
a
cutting
it
would
be
pleasant
news
cadwallader
hunter
who
was
a
student
of
faces
saw
the
change
on
lord
loveland
features
and
was
relieved
though
relief
brought
no
liking
he
had
begun
to
be
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
the
conversation
because
a
failure
to
thaw
on
loveland
part
would
have
been
awkward
after
certain
boasts
lately
made
now
he
saw
that
he
had
as
usual
taken
the
right
tack
and
that
his
efforts
were
destined
to
succeed
i
know
almost
everybody
on
board
went
on
the
american
that
is
everybody
who
counts
who
is
that
man
walking
with
the
tall
girl
in
grey
val
deigned
to
enquire
as
his
first
choice
among
the
beauties
of
the
ship
came
in
sight
is
he
someone
of
importance
cadwallader
hunter
naturally
understood
that
it
was
the
girl
not
the
man
in
whom
loveland
was
interested
that
is
judson
coolidge
he
replied
and
it
is
miss
elinor
coolidge
his
only
child
who
is
with
him
he
is
a
rich
man
though
not
one
of
our
richest
made
his
money
in
the
wholesale
dry
goods
business
in
chicago
but
miss
elinor
whom
he
adores
him
the
mother
dead
and
as
the
girl
knows
her
market
value
she
induced
her
father
to
take
a
big
house
in
new
york
and
a
cottage
at
newport
would
you
care
to
meet
them
thanks
yes
a
little
later
answered
val
very
civilly
for
him
there
are
several
other
pretty
young
women
on
board
said
cadwallader
hunter
so
i
noticed
said
loveland
ah
men
of
your
country
appreciate
the
charming
women
of
ours
carried
away
many
of
our
fairest
flowers
and
some
of
the
best
worth
plucking
is
that
a
pun
asked
loveland
staring
at
his
companion
to
see
if
he
had
the
impudence
to
mean
anything
major
cadwallader
hunter
tittered
he
had
an
irritating
little
habit
of
tittering
when
he
was
ingratiating
himself
with
new
acquaintances
but
it
was
a
most
refined
titter
oh
dear
i
see
what
you
mean
but
no
indeed
i
was
quite
innocent
of
any
i
was
merely
trying
my
best
to
be
poetical
i
assure
you
there
was
no
question
of
in
the
international
alliances
of
british
titles
and
american
dollars
i
had
in
mind
a
familiar
and
to
my
idea
suitable
combination
but
perhaps
you
disapprove
of
international
marriages
not
i
said
val
the
tone
told
cadwallader
hunter
all
that
he
wanted
to
learn
he
now
knew
if
he
had
not
been
practically
sure
before
that
lord
loveland
was
in
search
of
a
rich
wife
he
saw
his
way
to
earning
considerable
kudos
in
playing
to
a
young
and
unusually
british
peer
and
he
determined
to
become
that
whether
the
bear
yearned
for
his
leadership
or
not
miss
coolidge
is
not
the
only
handsome
heiress
on
board
there
are
others
there
are
others
he
went
on
airily
you
have
only
to
point
out
any
young
lady
whose
acquaintance
you
would
like
to
make
and
the
thing
is
a
do
you
know
a
loveland
on
the
ship
val
enquired
after
a
slight
hesitation
which
he
could
hardly
have
explained
to
himself
major
cadwallader
hunter
shook
his
head
now
that
you
speak
of
it
i
think
i
do
recall
there
being
a
loveland
on
the
but
she
has
a
niece
said
val
ah
the
elder
man
pulled
a
folded
out
of
his
pocket
and
ran
his
eye
down
the
l
then
the
niece
has
not
the
same
name
but
i
engage
to
find
out
all
about
the
ladies
for
you
if
interested
in
them
loveland
paused
for
an
instant
on
the
point
of
refusing
the
service
but
he
reflected
that
making
enquiries
about
unknown
ladies
was
not
a
dignified
proceeding
and
that
he
would
prefer
to
have
major
cadwallader
hunter
undertake
it
rather
than
compromise
himself
it
will
be
easy
for
me
as
i
know
so
many
people
volunteered
the
american
oh
very
well
thank
you
said
loveland
stiffly
with
that
upward
inflection
of
the
voice
which
can
make
a
thank
you
as
irritating
as
a
he
was
ready
now
to
use
major
cadwallader
hunter
for
catspawing
in
all
its
branches
but
did
not
intend
to
be
over
civil
in
return
he
divined
that
by
name
was
a
by
nature
that
vast
wealth
or
even
a
really
good
title
was
to
him
balm
in
gilead
and
that
he
was
not
one
of
those
sensitive
souls
who
find
it
difficult
to
be
kind
to
the
rich
for
fear
of
being
misunderstood
by
the
world
and
the
leader
was
delighted
to
become
lord
loveland
catspaw
because
he
hoped
that
his
way
of
handling
the
chestnuts
would
do
him
honour
he
believed
that
if
through
lord
loveland
he
did
not
become
king
of
all
the
lions
in
new
york
that
season
he
might
at
least
be
king
jester
presently
still
smiling
he
left
val
stretched
luxuriously
in
the
labelled
and
trotted
away
to
tell
more
people
what
a
charming
fellow
lord
loveland
was
all
the
while
it
would
have
done
his
soul
good
what
there
was
of
it
to
box
val
ears
but
it
would
have
done
him
still
more
good
to
be
or
even
for
all
that
he
had
ever
possessed
was
long
ago
worn
to
rags
major
cadwallader
hunter
prided
himself
on
being
able
to
find
out
everything
about
everybody
even
when
starting
from
the
point
of
complete
ignorance
and
handicapped
by
a
time
limit
indeed
he
had
a
nice
detective
instinct
and
putting
it
to
use
was
one
of
the
games
he
played
best
but
he
found
himself
confronted
with
difficulties
in
the
case
of
loveland
and
her
niece
it
was
simple
to
find
out
the
girl
name
and
that
loveland
the
aunt
was
a
delicate
little
person
at
that
time
of
life
when
sensible
women
cling
no
longer
to
the
ragged
edge
of
youth
as
a
bat
clings
to
a
shutter
it
was
easy
to
learn
stewards
and
stewardesses
reveal
such
things
if
handled
by
experts
that
loveland
had
slipped
into
her
berth
on
starting
with
the
intention
of
remaining
there
during
the
whole
voyage
weather
or
no
weather
but
as
to
wealth
and
as
to
ancestors
cadwallader
hunter
was
as
devout
a
worshipper
of
ancestors
as
any
chinaman
the
matter
was
more
difficult
however
he
was
eventually
fortunate
enough
to
stumble
upon
an
acquaintance
a
milton
who
had
met
loveland
and
her
niece
while
travelling
in
england
milton
was
a
charming
woman
but
she
had
some
weaknesses
in
a
sojourn
of
six
weeks
she
had
become
so
much
more
english
than
the
english
that
she
had
taken
to
calling
her
daughter
fanny
fawny
she
pitied
loveland
and
loveland
niece
because
they
were
so
so
american
do
you
know
also
she
was
perfectly
certain
from
their
way
of
doing
things
from
remarks
they
had
let
drop
and
answers
they
had
given
to
her
questions
that
they
were
nobodies
they
lived
in
a
town
in
the
middle
west
knew
no
new
york
people
poor
things
and
were
altogether
provincial
they
had
been
abroad
for
the
first
time
had
enjoyed
themselves
with
the
most
countrified
enthusiasm
everywhere
and
were
so
much
interested
in
history
and
dull
subjects
of
that
sort
that
fawny
mother
fawncied
they
were
perhaps
schoolteachers
on
their
holidays
especially
as
they
were
so
reserved
about
their
own
affairs
that
there
must
be
something
they
were
ashamed
of
major
cadwallader
hunter
was
glad
to
hear
these
damaging
details
because
it
was
evident
that
the
englishman
was
taken
with
loveland
niece
the
wanted
his
bear
for
more
important
girls
it
was
not
till
nearly
that
he
was
able
to
make
his
report
to
loveland
meanwhile
during
his
leader
absence
the
bear
had
found
out
some
things
for
himself
and
had
forgotten
major
cadwallader
hunter
val
had
felt
the
need
of
another
constitutional
and
seeing
his
namesake
niece
struggling
with
a
rug
had
tucked
it
round
her
feet
they
were
pretty
feet
and
val
was
very
fastidious
about
a
woman
feet
these
were
even
prettier
and
many
sizes
smaller
than
miss
coolidge
therefore
he
was
glad
that
a
chair
stood
empty
for
the
moment
he
begged
so
meekly
to
sit
down
and
talk
for
a
little
while
that
his
mother
could
she
have
heard
him
would
have
trembled
lest
he
might
be
sickening
for
something
but
he
had
talked
for
more
than
a
little
while
and
then
had
been
forced
to
go
because
the
owner
of
the
chair
came
back
and
hovered
suggestively
loveland
had
only
just
got
up
and
was
taking
his
leave
when
major
cadwallader
hunter
arrived
from
the
where
he
had
been
gleaning
facts
she
is
a
miss
dearmer
he
announced
oh
i
know
that
already
val
returned
ungratefully
she
told
me
herself
lesley
dearmer
i
had
got
as
far
as
the
lesley
yet
val
laughed
lightly
for
he
had
had
a
delightful
conversation
with
miss
dearmer
that
cleft
in
her
chin
had
not
proved
a
trap
to
catch
the
unwary
whom
it
tempted
to
expect
a
merry
wit
and
while
loveland
sat
beside
her
she
had
flung
bright
thought
after
bright
thought
carelessly
as
a
cashier
in
a
bank
shovels
out
gold
for
other
people
purses
he
had
never
met
a
girl
like
miss
dearmer
no
wonder
she
could
write
stories
but
he
felt
it
was
far
more
suitable
that
she
should
entertain
the
marquis
of
loveland
of
course
you
must
do
exactly
as
you
please
said
cadwallader
hunter
but
from
what
i
learned
i
fancy
you
can
pass
your
valuable
time
better
on
this
trip
than
in
the
society
of
miss
dearmer
what
do
you
mean
val
flashed
out
at
him
oh
only
that
it
just
as
i
thought
she
and
her
aunt
are
ordinary
provincial
little
people
with
no
money
or
connections
they
live
in
the
southwest
near
a
city
called
louisville
these
ladies
aunt
and
niece
have
been
as
much
of
europe
as
they
could
afford
and
are
now
returning
to
their
native
wilds
where
they
probably
stay
for
the
remainder
of
their
respectable
colourless
lives
the
picture
was
not
alluring
and
loveland
face
fell
and
miss
coolidge
are
at
your
table
said
cadwallader
hunter
and
i
just
been
arranging
to
sit
there
too
so
i
can
introduce
you
this
evening
at
dinner
you
be
next
miss
coolidge
and
opposite
have
a
very
nice
girl
a
miss
fanny
milton
who
admires
englishmen
her
mother
is
a
youngish
woman
with
a
temper
she
does
get
on
well
with
her
husband
but
he
is
a
very
rich
man
who
must
give
a
dot
of
at
least
five
hundred
thousand
to
his
daughter
these
people
are
friends
of
mine
and
will
be
very
pleased
to
know
you
loveland
did
not
doubt
the
last
statement
nor
did
he
feel
grateful
to
his
benefactor
this
general
provider
of
charming
rich
young
ladies
he
was
sulkily
regretting
that
miss
dearmer
was
poor
and
provincial
and
altogether
impossible
as
the
future
lady
loveland
chapter
seven
guide
philosopher
and
friend
well
said
the
girl
what
do
you
think
of
things
i
think
answered
loveland
it
a
beastly
shame
we
not
put
at
the
same
table
i
mean
of
things
in
general
i
prefer
to
think
of
you
in
particular
it
would
pay
said
the
girl
with
one
of
her
whimsical
smiles
loveland
looked
at
her
sharply
what
makes
you
say
that
he
wanted
to
know
because
it
true
why
do
you
insinuate
that
i
only
want
to
do
things
that
pay
i
told
you
i
wrote
stories
did
i
well
to
write
stories
one
must
make
a
study
of
man
i
do
and
i
never
found
it
dull
yet
i
glad
you
do
find
it
dull
where
i
concerned
said
val
but
i
not
glad
you
consider
me
a
swine
lucky
i
just
been
in
england
and
heard
other
englishmen
talk
said
the
girl
if
not
i
should
hardly
understand
that
pretty
expression
so
you
been
making
a
study
of
other
englishmen
what
did
you
think
of
us
that
you
as
a
race
are
very
tall
and
tweedy
and
that
you
precisely
dissatisfied
with
yourselves
it
was
the
next
morning
and
they
were
pacing
up
and
down
the
long
white
deck
loveland
had
joined
miss
dearmer
as
she
walked
and
she
had
not
been
repellent
in
her
manner
yet
somehow
her
friendliness
did
not
encourage
him
to
increasing
conceit
even
before
she
had
made
that
little
remark
about
studying
man
he
had
vaguely
felt
that
she
read
him
as
if
he
were
a
cypher
of
which
she
had
found
the
key
i
hope
you
met
the
right
kind
of
men
he
said
you
mean
men
like
you
you
see
i
know
who
you
are
now
who
told
you
anything
about
me
miss
milton
oh
you
know
her
daughter
of
the
woman
pretty
blushy
little
thing
who
sits
at
my
table
yes
we
were
travelling
in
england
at
the
same
time
and
met
often
at
hotels
what
did
miss
milton
say
about
me
do
you
really
want
to
know
yes
i
not
a
coward
she
said
she
wondered
if
you
were
going
over
to
our
country
to
try
and
marry
an
american
girl
by
jove
well
supposing
i
do
try
what
your
opinion
do
you
think
i
stand
a
good
chance
of
bringing
it
off
it
rather
soon
for
me
to
judge
you
seem
to
have
made
up
your
mind
quickly
about
some
of
my
other
qualities
about
my
wanting
to
do
things
which
pay
for
instance
you
have
forgiven
me
that
it
might
pay
to
and
marry
an
american
girl
well
admitted
loveland
on
an
impulse
no
matter
how
much
i
might
want
to
i
could
marry
one
if
it
did
pay
now
you
are
being
frank
replied
miss
lesley
i
like
people
to
be
frank
so
do
i
said
loveland
when
that
does
mean
being
disagreeable
as
it
generally
does
from
one
relations
especially
one
maiden
aunts
england
expects
that
every
aunt
will
do
her
duty
luckily
not
my
aunt
so
please
do
do
yours
if
unpleasant
but
could
we
be
frank
and
friends
i
should
like
most
awfully
to
have
you
for
my
friend
you
could
be
no
end
valuable
to
me
you
know
about
giving
me
good
advice
if
you
would
she
laughed
i
dare
say
but
could
you
be
valuable
to
me
loveland
wished
that
he
might
dare
to
be
dangerous
but
the
idea
of
having
her
for
a
friend
into
whose
pink
shell
of
an
ear
he
could
pour
confidences
really
attracted
him
since
her
value
not
being
cash
value
could
be
realised
by
him
in
no
other
way
and
of
course
if
she
would
promise
to
be
his
friend
it
would
be
caddish
to
make
love
to
her
he
felt
very
virtuous
as
he
laid
down
this
rule
for
himself
i
let
you
study
me
as
much
as
you
like
and
put
me
into
your
next
story
as
the
villain
he
looked
rather
blank
his
conception
for
himself
was
always
the
part
of
hero
but
after
all
it
usually
baronets
who
villains
in
stories
and
plays
she
went
on
a
marquis
you
are
a
marquis
are
you
may
perhaps
be
a
fellow
being
please
treat
me
as
such
then
said
loveland
i
will
anyway
till
further
notice
now
you
may
begin
to
tell
me
frank
things
and
i
give
you
frank
advice
about
them
as
a
friend
how
i
wish
you
were
rich
exclaimed
loveland
thinking
aloud
as
he
did
sometimes
how
do
you
know
i
not
oh
of
course
major
cadwallader
hunter
found
out
for
you
he
would
he
the
sort
of
man
who
takes
a
worm
eye
view
of
the
world
and
of
women
and
wealth
but
never
mind
if
i
not
rich
i
do
mind
i
should
want
you
for
a
friend
if
you
were
you
would
oh
well
now
you
are
being
still
franker
are
you
you
said
you
liked
people
to
be
frank
ye
es
i
have
offended
you
have
i
no
i
just
getting
used
to
you
it
quite
interesting
what
do
you
want
my
advice
about
other
girls
i
suppose
it
may
come
to
that
loveland
admitted
anyone
in
particular
at
the
moment
well
supposing
i
were
forced
to
marry
money
for
the
sake
of
of
my
estates
and
all
that
is
there
anyone
on
board
you
recommend
you
two
very
eligible
girls
at
your
table
yes
but
hang
it
all
it
too
much
of
a
good
thing
having
them
at
one
elbow
like
that
you
know
if
only
it
were
you
instead
on
the
principle
of
having
the
poor
always
with
one
but
for
that
have
to
change
and
sit
at
mine
we
all
poor
there
i
think
it
the
ineligible
table
for
both
sexes
would
you
care
to
come
i
care
to
but
i
could
afford
it
said
val
i
must
stop
where
i
am
and
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
you
mean
the
steward
who
arranged
the
seats
what
else
did
miss
milton
say
about
me
that
you
were
very
as
we
being
frank
i
hope
you
agreed
with
her
oh
yes
i
had
to
your
looks
are
so
obvious
so
much
a
part
of
your
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
it
would
be
silly
to
deny
that
the
shop
windows
are
well
decorated
it
was
apropos
of
your
marrying
that
she
spoke
i
said
a
handsome
man
ought
to
be
driven
into
the
obscurity
of
marriage
by
necessity
he
ought
simply
to
be
supported
by
the
nation
become
a
sort
of
public
institution
and
be
the
pride
of
his
country
be
sent
beautifully
got
up
to
walk
in
parks
and
dance
at
balls
and
make
life
pleasant
for
girls
thank
you
anything
else
from
miss
milton
or
me
from
you
nothing
more
from
me
the
rest
was
silence
from
miss
milton
then
let
me
see
she
said
it
seemed
as
if
you
bought
your
eyelashes
by
the
yard
and
been
frightfully
extravagant
wish
i
could
pawn
them
if
you
marry
as
you
intend
you
wo
need
to
i
say
i
afraid
you
frightfully
sarcastic
said
loveland
who
had
never
had
an
american
girl
for
a
friend
before
and
found
that
having
one
kept
his
hands
full
you
think
i
a
beast
to
marry
a
girl
for
her
money
first
catch
your
hare
you
mean
i
may
get
one
to
take
me
one
never
can
tell
there
have
been
slips
between
cup
and
lip
although
i
poor
i
can
give
my
wife
a
lot
of
things
a
woman
likes
to
have
second
best
things
oh
come
you
have
stopped
to
think
what
they
are
i
stopped
to
think
that
love
the
best
thing
the
thing
a
girl
cares
most
for
a
man
to
give
her
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
girls
i
know
would
be
pretty
well
satisfied
with
the
right
to
walk
into
a
behind
a
duchess
and
do
you
what
a
lot
you
got
to
learn
about
girls
i
do
think
i
have
said
val
i
think
i
know
most
of
it
about
life
then
and
about
yourself
oh
i
know
nearly
all
there
is
to
be
known
about
them
you
really
do
need
a
friend
laughed
the
girl
to
keep
me
from
being
bored
to
keep
you
from
heaps
of
things
well
go
on
being
my
friend
and
giving
me
good
advice
please
said
loveland
there
miss
coolidge
too
she
a
beautiful
creature
are
there
many
other
girls
in
the
states
as
beautiful
as
she
as
beautiful
but
few
more
beautiful
any
beautiful
ones
richer
i
not
up
in
that
kind
of
statistics
major
cadwallader
hunter
is
yes
but
i
do
care
for
the
fellow
i
rather
take
counsel
with
you
do
you
know
miss
coolidge
no
i
wish
you
did
would
you
like
me
to
use
my
influence
with
her
i
should
like
you
to
use
your
influence
with
me
to
keep
me
up
to
the
mark
she
rather
hard
to
talk
to
so
different
from
you
she
knows
her
value
she
several
millions
as
we
say
in
america
i
wish
we
did
why
should
she
worry
to
make
herself
agreeable
she
can
get
all
the
attention
she
wants
without
bothering
whereas
we
poor
girls
have
to
work
hard
if
we
want
to
be
popular
in
spite
of
our
poverty
i
suppose
there
something
in
that
said
loveland
too
deeply
absorbed
in
his
own
affairs
not
to
take
her
in
earnest
and
the
girl
would
have
liked
to
turn
a
scornful
shoulder
upon
him
if
his
voice
had
not
been
so
nice
and
if
he
had
not
been
so
handsome
as
it
was
she
wanted
to
turn
upon
herself
because
she
knew
that
she
was
influenced
by
the
nice
voice
the
clear
features
and
the
blue
eyes
he
is
a
perfectly
worthless
young
man
she
reflected
savagely
yet
she
did
not
tell
him
as
he
deserved
that
she
had
reconsidered
and
would
not
after
all
undertake
the
extra
hard
work
of
being
his
guide
philosopher
and
friend
it
will
be
an
experience
for
me
she
thought
and
she
remembered
that
she
had
summed
up
his
character
from
the
first
the
revelations
he
had
just
made
of
his
inner
self
ought
not
now
to
surprise
her
so
the
days
went
on
and
the
pair
remained
friends
a
state
of
affairs
which
took
more
of
val
time
than
he
should
have
spared
from
his
real
ambitions
loveland
had
tried
at
intervals
to
be
nice
to
miss
coolidge
and
miss
milton
and
he
met
other
pretty
girls
to
whom
he
felt
obliged
to
be
agreeable
because
major
cadwallader
hunter
said
that
they
were
heiresses
but
it
is
difficult
to
be
equally
nice
to
five
or
six
charming
young
women
at
once
and
within
a
comparatively
limited
area
when
you
have
not
made
up
your
mind
which
of
them
you
want
to
marry
or
whether
you
will
not
in
the
end
throw
them
all
over
to
marry
someone
else
whom
you
have
not
yet
seen
and
it
is
a
particularly
difficult
task
when
you
would
prefer
to
be
nice
to
someone
else
whom
you
have
already
seen
besides
lord
loveland
thought
too
much
of
himself
to
pretend
successfully
when
so
far
from
being
in
love
he
was
considerably
bored
each
girl
he
knew
on
the
ship
bored
him
in
her
own
separate
way
except
his
friend
miss
dearmer
to
whom
he
went
frequently
for
good
advice
about
the
others
perhaps
if
he
had
not
known
her
the
other
girls
or
some
of
them
would
not
have
bored
him
but
as
it
was
they
were
occasionally
tiresome
in
his
eyes
when
he
would
have
liked
to
be
with
lesley
instead
and
though
lord
loveland
was
clever
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
hide
his
feelings
sometimes
so
sure
was
he
of
their
forgiveness
if
he
wanted
it
he
was
downright
rude
and
there
is
nothing
a
nice
american
girl
forgives
less
easily
than
rudeness
which
springs
from
a
man
at
first
all
the
girls
had
admired
loveland
not
only
because
he
had
a
title
but
because
he
was
himself
and
some
of
the
younger
ones
like
fanny
milton
and
madge
beverly
had
been
inclined
to
regard
him
as
a
starry
paladin
fanny
said
he
was
so
handsome
it
almost
hurt
and
that
she
could
hardly
talk
to
him
for
gazing
at
his
gibson
chin
but
when
the
more
sophisticated
eva
turner
elinor
coolidge
kate
wood
and
a
few
others
realised
that
their
starry
paladin
was
impudently
inspecting
them
all
with
a
view
to
the
possible
purchase
of
the
most
satisfactory
each
began
to
hate
him
secretly
with
power
secretly
because
there
was
a
kind
of
glory
in
him
as
an
asset
and
a
rivalry
for
the
asset
just
as
there
might
be
among
smaller
girls
with
only
one
doll
an
unlovable
but
expensive
doll
to
play
with
not
one
of
the
number
would
sacrifice
all
right
in
the
doll
and
give
it
up
to
her
companions
they
were
worldly
though
girls
to
whom
major
cadwallader
hunter
had
introduced
his
prize
and
they
foresaw
that
handsome
lord
loveland
would
be
petted
perhaps
fought
for
in
society
when
he
had
left
the
little
world
of
the
for
the
bigger
world
of
new
york
there
would
be
an
advantage
in
having
known
him
first
in
case
he
should
become
the
rage
as
he
was
sure
to
do
if
not
too
insufferably
rude
and
offensive
thinking
of
this
each
girl
clung
to
her
share
of
him
and
refrained
from
trampling
on
the
expensive
doll
as
for
her
pride
sake
she
ached
to
do
nor
did
elinor
coolidge
and
fanny
milton
and
the
rest
speak
their
true
feelings
frankly
out
to
one
another
each
wished
her
friends
to
believe
that
he
was
nice
to
her
alone
that
his
insolence
was
charmed
into
docility
in
a
duet
with
her
for
in
that
way
could
be
maintained
and
jealousy
aroused
val
was
unaware
of
the
hatred
but
conscious
of
the
rivalry
and
was
altogether
kept
very
busy
he
forgot
to
marconi
to
his
mother
that
he
had
sailed
on
the
as
jim
harborough
had
thought
he
might
forget
as
for
writing
he
had
not
a
moment
for
any
such
sedentary
employment
once
or
twice
he
did
make
up
his
mind
to
begin
a
letter
to
lady
loveland
but
when
he
could
get
a
few
minutes
off
duty
it
seemed
such
a
waste
of
time
not
to
go
and
ask
for
good
advice
from
lesley
dearmer
that
somehow
pen
was
never
put
to
paper
and
so
at
last
came
the
day
for
landing
chapter
eight
hail
to
the
land
goodbye
to
the
girl
the
passed
the
noble
statue
of
liberty
enlightening
the
world
and
loveland
admired
her
impersonally
but
felt
that
had
she
been
a
live
millionairess
he
would
not
have
dared
propose
to
her
then
presently
the
hugeness
of
the
great
city
loomed
monstrous
mountainous
in
purple
shadow
against
such
a
blue
sky
as
italy
and
new
york
know
a
crowd
was
massed
on
the
dock
to
welcome
the
and
her
passengers
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
left
england
val
felt
a
vague
homesickness
stirring
in
his
breast
almost
everyone
else
on
board
seemed
to
have
at
least
one
friend
and
some
had
half
a
dozen
but
all
the
smiling
eager
faces
looking
up
were
strange
to
his
eyes
there
was
no
one
for
him
and
he
had
a
sudden
queer
sensation
of
not
being
at
home
in
the
world
this
in
spite
of
invitations
from
everybody
he
had
met
on
the
ship
except
one
the
one
who
mattered
coolidge
and
several
other
fathers
and
uncles
of
pretty
girls
had
asked
him
to
make
their
house
his
home
but
he
had
taken
jim
harborough
advice
to
heart
and
excused
himself
warily
his
idea
was
to
let
new
york
society
pass
before
his
eyes
in
review
before
risking
a
premature
entanglement
to
this
course
he
committed
himself
in
cold
blood
since
he
could
not
have
lesley
dearmer
all
that
mattered
to
him
in
a
girl
was
decent
manners
decent
looks
and
many
millions
he
should
have
rejoiced
that
it
was
time
to
land
and
have
felt
keen
to
set
to
work
upon
the
business
which
had
brought
him
across
the
sea
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
rejoice
at
anything
and
it
was
lesley
fault
he
had
planned
a
moonlight
farewell
for
the
night
before
but
lesley
thwarted
him
by
talking
the
whole
evening
long
with
a
sporting
youth
whom
val
wrathfully
stigmatised
in
his
mind
as
suffering
from
motor
bicycle
face
bridge
eye
clutch
knee
and
tennis
elbow
then
when
she
had
tired
of
her
flirtation
she
went
to
bed
next
morning
it
was
only
as
the
neared
her
slip
that
the
girl
appeared
again
without
seeming
to
notice
loveland
she
stood
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
rail
not
far
from
him
it
occurred
to
val
that
after
all
it
was
a
matter
of
no
importance
to
her
that
their
lives
were
to
be
lived
apart
and
the
separation
was
at
hand
he
had
thought
of
this
hour
but
now
it
was
here
he
was
going
to
lose
her
tomorrow
and
all
the
tomorrows
he
would
have
no
sweet
merry
friend
to
advise
him
and
listen
half
in
earnest
to
his
confidences
suddenly
his
heart
felt
like
a
large
cold
boiled
beetroot
in
his
breast
he
went
and
stood
behind
the
girl
dumb
with
a
strange
new
misery
he
could
not
understand
and
as
though
she
had
heard
the
unerring
speech
of
his
silence
she
turned
at
first
her
beautiful
brown
eyes
flashed
a
laughing
challenge
at
him
as
if
they
said
would
you
like
to
make
me
think
you
really
care
but
i
do
think
it
and
wo
and
neither
do
you
care
we
both
been
playing
then
something
in
his
look
softened
hers
she
smiled
kindly
though
not
wholly
without
guile
are
you
excited
she
asked
why
should
i
be
excited
he
grumbled
because
well
you
a
soldier
and
know
what
war
is
like
i
heard
that
the
most
exciting
thing
which
can
happen
is
a
call
to
make
a
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
the
midst
of
a
dream
and
on
an
empty
stomach
but
i
should
think
the
call
to
a
matrimonial
sortie
on
an
empty
purse
yes
when
it
a
question
of
selling
yourself
to
fill
it
i
do
mean
to
sell
myself
i
shall
still
belong
to
myself
and
to
one
other
i
wo
say
who
that
other
is
for
i
pretty
well
told
you
already
it
no
use
pretending
not
to
understand
i
know
what
you
want
me
to
you
mean
if
i
never
knew
before
how
much
i
do
mean
it
i
know
now
when
i
got
to
say
you
need
say
it
you
tried
hard
to
keep
me
from
saying
it
have
you
but
look
here
lesley
do
look
at
me
i
awfully
cut
up
at
leaving
you
you
not
to
call
me
lesley
you
ca
prevent
my
calling
you
lesley
to
myself
you
soon
forget
the
name
never
i
can
never
forget
you
worse
luck
the
thought
of
you
is
going
to
come
between
me
and
other
things
the
thought
must
learn
better
manners
not
to
in
as
we
say
over
here
oh
it
will
soon
be
tamed
you
have
so
much
to
do
i
hope
i
shall
said
loveland
i
say
are
you
going
to
forget
me
as
soon
as
we
parted
the
girl
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
laughed
yet
her
laugh
had
not
quite
the
frank
lightheartedness
which
was
usually
one
of
its
charms
i
shall
make
a
note
of
you
for
my
next
story
but
one
she
answered
you
not
very
kind
are
you
sure
you
deserve
kindness
i
sure
i
want
it
from
you
how
you
have
always
got
what
you
wanted
in
your
life
have
you
one
way
or
another
life
would
be
worth
living
if
one
did
oh
it
not
much
good
saying
to
you
that
that
a
selfish
way
of
looking
at
life
but
you
never
had
any
lessons
and
i
suppose
you
never
will
have
you
go
on
getting
what
you
want
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
you
ought
to
get
it
till
the
end
i
hope
so
sincerely
said
val
without
shame
but
i
sha
get
one
of
the
things
i
want
most
unless
you
promise
to
write
to
me
she
shook
her
head
i
ca
promise
that
i
would
if
i
could
as
for
getting
your
news
i
shall
read
it
in
the
papers
which
are
sure
to
chronicle
all
lord
loveland
does
and
says
and
a
lot
he
does
do
or
say
the
louisville
papers
will
have
things
about
you
copied
from
new
york
in
the
sunday
editions
yes
i
shall
be
able
to
read
about
you
every
sunday
lots
of
things
you
would
tell
in
letters
if
i
let
you
write
i
shall
see
rumours
of
your
engagement
then
an
announcement
i
wonder
if
it
will
be
the
survival
of
the
prettiest
miss
coolidge
or
if
you
be
knocked
down
on
your
knees
to
a
higher
bid
you
not
letting
me
get
much
pleasure
out
of
my
last
moments
with
you
he
complained
his
blue
eyes
really
pathetic
do
you
despise
me
after
all
she
looked
up
at
him
only
one
side
of
you
she
answered
a
little
sadly
but
you
rather
like
the
moon
we
see
only
one
of
her
sides
the
other
we
have
to
take
on
faith
perhaps
it
silly
of
me
yet
sometimes
in
some
moods
i
do
take
your
other
side
on
faith
what
is
there
on
that
side
he
asked
eagerly
i
do
know
and
i
sure
you
do
you
probably
never
will
for
the
light
shines
so
brightly
on
the
one
turned
towards
the
world
now
it
be
there
my
dear
little
aunt
who
been
on
deck
ever
since
we
passed
governor
island
looking
for
me
are
these
to
be
our
last
words
together
then
val
had
a
sickening
pang
he
had
not
known
it
was
going
to
be
as
bad
as
this
and
it
would
have
been
so
bad
if
she
had
seemed
to
care
more
yes
they
must
be
the
last
unless
just
a
snippy
very
pleased
to
have
met
you
as
we
leave
the
ship
i
wish
you
the
best
luck
shall
i
say
own
wish
wish
i
thee
she
spoke
in
a
hard
bright
tone
just
poising
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
before
flitting
to
her
aunt
do
forget
me
think
of
me
sometimes
loveland
implored
as
he
wrung
the
little
hand
she
held
out
and
perhaps
never
in
his
life
had
there
been
so
much
true
feeling
in
his
voice
i
will
think
of
you
sometimes
she
said
as
if
mechanically
repeating
the
words
try
and
think
the
best
of
me
yes
i
try
to
do
that
too
goodbye
but
he
would
not
let
her
hand
go
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
although
he
knew
he
must
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
back
a
plea
that
she
would
love
him
that
she
would
marry
him
even
though
the
crumbling
walls
of
loveland
castle
fell
but
instead
he
stammered
am
i
never
to
see
you
again
ca
you
stop
in
new
york
for
a
few
days
and
let
me
call
on
on
you
and
your
aunt
just
to
break
the
blow
of
parting
no
we
ca
stop
she
said
we
been
away
from
home
too
long
already
we
have
lots
to
do
you
know
i
work
for
my
living
those
stories
yes
but
could
you
write
them
in
new
york
no
i
could
indeed
aunt
barbara
and
i
start
for
louisville
this
afternoon
we
live
not
far
away
may
i
go
with
you
to
the
train
what
desert
valuable
friends
whom
it
your
duty
to
cultivate
if
you
to
have
flowers
in
the
garden
of
your
future
i
desert
anyone
or
anything
for
you
thank
you
i
believe
you
really
mean
that
this
minute
i
no
do
protest
sufficient
for
the
minute
is
the
meaning
thereof
i
must
go
i
to
go
while
you
still
mean
it
all
and
i
rather
not
see
you
again
because
i
like
to
keep
the
memory
of
you
as
you
look
and
are
in
this
minute
nothing
less
it
will
seem
afterwards
to
justify
our
temporary
partnership
in
case
i
ever
ask
myself
why
and
before
he
could
answer
she
was
gone
he
dared
not
follow
and
instantly
lost
sight
of
her
in
the
crowd
that
poured
to
the
rail
to
greet
the
waiting
crowd
below
afterwards
on
the
dock
he
saw
her
again
but
only
at
a
distance
for
her
aunt
luggage
had
been
marked
d
that
it
might
chaperon
miss
dearmer
and
enable
the
two
ladies
to
keep
each
other
company
during
the
tedious
time
of
waiting
from
the
far
off
stall
under
the
big
letter
l
loveland
gazed
sadly
at
the
back
of
his
lost
friend
head
her
face
either
by
accident
or
design
being
turned
from
him
his
boxes
were
long
in
coming
and
as
it
happened
that
none
of
his
were
l
he
had
no
one
to
talk
to
nothing
pleasanter
to
do
than
look
at
miss
dearmer
back
and
gradually
lose
hope
of
her
relenting
she
had
brought
a
little
for
her
aunt
and
that
lady
sat
facing
loveland
her
eyes
so
destitute
of
interest
when
now
and
then
they
strayed
in
his
direction
that
he
began
to
believe
her
niece
had
never
mentioned
his
existence
more
than
once
he
had
pictured
lesley
describing
her
aunt
distinguished
namesake
had
fancied
loveland
asking
questions
and
wished
that
he
might
hear
the
answers
the
indifference
was
not
flattering
to
his
but
loveland
did
not
look
a
woman
to
claim
a
relation
because
he
was
a
peer
lesley
aunt
was
a
little
woman
with
hair
folded
like
wings
that
slanted
softly
down
her
forehead
covering
her
ears
hers
was
a
gentle
face
with
eyes
that
gazed
kindly
and
somehow
impersonally
out
upon
the
world
she
had
the
air
which
many
american
mothers
wear
of
having
contentedly
stepped
aside
from
the
of
life
in
favour
of
a
younger
generation
and
of
having
lost
interest
in
herself
as
a
separate
entity
lesley
and
loveland
all
got
their
luggage
dumped
down
under
letter
d
before
a
single
l
box
had
appeared
then
when
val
did
come
and
the
property
of
other
impatient
l
at
the
same
time
the
outside
world
was
lost
to
view
loveland
got
hold
of
a
custom
house
man
who
considering
the
indubitable
fact
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
british
subject
and
believing
the
britisher
statement
that
he
was
merely
on
a
visit
to
america
made
no
unnecessary
trouble
he
was
in
a
hurry
like
everybody
else
and
did
little
more
than
casually
open
the
leather
portmanteaux
the
cabin
trunk
the
hat
box
and
the
fitted
glittering
with
coronets
which
constituted
lord
luggage
very
few
minutes
were
wasted
in
the
examination
though
americans
all
around
were
suffering
severely
nevertheless
when
his
keys
were
in
his
hand
again
and
val
was
ready
to
separate
himself
and
his
belongings
from
the
seething
mass
of
anxious
l
miss
dearmer
and
her
aunt
had
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
dock
chapter
nine
foxham
redivivus
loveland
tried
to
put
thoughts
of
the
girl
out
of
his
head
as
he
drove
through
the
exciting
streets
of
new
york
which
seemed
to
him
colourful
and
strange
as
a
vast
sown
regardlessly
but
despite
the
rush
and
roar
of
elevated
trains
above
his
head
the
swift
whirr
of
electric
trams
to
left
to
right
of
him
on
a
level
and
the
bizarre
effect
of
the
which
turned
long
thoroughfares
into
shadowed
valleys
he
could
not
throw
open
his
mind
to
the
rush
of
new
impressions
this
brilliant
new
york
made
him
feel
after
all
a
person
of
comparatively
small
importance
he
began
to
repent
having
refused
invitations
for
instead
of
bumping
dolefully
to
a
hotel
in
a
cab
which
was
the
least
modern
thing
new
york
had
shown
him
he
might
now
be
spinning
uptown
in
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
hospitable
motor
cars
in
his
isolation
he
regretted
the
coolidges
and
even
cadwallader
hunter
who
had
pressed
him
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
his
flat
however
he
was
consoled
by
the
reflection
that
he
had
decided
wisely
and
that
wisdom
would
be
its
own
reward
it
was
better
not
to
lend
himself
to
anyone
until
he
had
seen
everyone
and
decided
to
whom
he
would
permanently
belong
when
the
bear
had
refused
the
hospitality
of
its
leader
cage
cadwallader
hunter
had
suggested
a
quiet
new
hotel
uptown
and
near
his
apartment
but
the
bear
did
not
know
that
it
was
a
bear
and
had
tired
of
dictation
loveland
had
heard
of
the
and
he
had
not
heard
of
the
quiet
new
hotel
men
he
knew
who
ran
over
to
new
york
on
such
errands
as
his
own
stopped
at
the
or
holland
house
or
the
plaza
and
val
who
believed
that
the
best
was
only
just
good
enough
would
not
risk
hiding
his
light
under
a
bushel
true
he
had
very
little
money
but
he
had
plenty
of
invitations
and
was
certain
to
have
more
a
couple
of
days
at
the
most
expensive
hotel
could
not
break
him
and
jim
and
betty
harborough
millionaire
friends
would
probably
expect
him
to
be
conspicuous
now
was
the
tide
in
his
affairs
which
must
be
taken
at
the
flood
and
he
could
not
afford
to
let
his
future
whoever
they
might
be
learn
to
despise
him
loveland
intention
had
been
to
ask
for
a
small
room
high
in
situation
and
low
in
price
but
once
inside
the
immense
building
which
looked
vast
enough
to
hold
half
new
york
pride
tied
his
tongue
pretty
girls
beautifully
dressed
and
men
with
facial
expressions
as
supercilious
as
his
own
were
standing
within
earshot
and
loveland
could
not
resist
satisfying
an
impulse
of
boyish
vanity
he
announced
to
a
superior
gentleman
at
a
desk
that
he
wanted
a
good
room
with
a
bath
his
charming
voice
and
english
accent
attracted
the
americans
near
him
and
under
his
mask
of
indifference
loveland
was
aware
of
the
attention
he
excited
the
superior
gentleman
thought
for
a
moment
and
consulted
a
book
then
he
said
that
he
had
no
single
rooms
with
baths
disengaged
at
present
but
that
there
was
a
suite
consisting
of
bedroom
bath
and
parlour
just
one
suite
and
that
probably
would
be
gone
in
another
minute
the
hint
of
rivalry
decided
loveland
very
well
i
will
take
it
he
said
here
my
card
if
you
wish
to
know
to
whom
you
are
letting
your
rooms
he
went
on
haughtily
in
response
to
a
sharp
glance
from
shrewd
experienced
eyes
and
the
hotel
clerk
read
aloud
marquis
of
loveland
at
this
everyone
who
had
not
been
staring
at
the
handsome
arrogant
young
englishman
began
to
stare
and
loveland
was
not
displeased
my
luggage
will
be
here
soon
i
hope
he
said
showing
several
metal
discs
about
which
his
ideas
were
rather
vague
the
clerk
answered
civilly
that
the
trunks
ought
to
arrive
in
half
an
hour
or
so
and
a
smart
youth
in
livery
was
told
off
to
show
lord
loveland
his
rooms
they
were
very
luxurious
rooms
almost
too
luxurious
and
loveland
experienced
a
faint
qualm
as
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
neglected
to
ask
the
price
but
they
ca
come
to
more
than
five
or
six
pounds
a
day
at
the
worst
he
thought
hopefully
he
had
brought
his
in
the
cab
and
as
the
letters
of
introduction
were
in
a
little
portable
contained
among
the
fittings
he
got
out
the
packet
to
read
over
the
addresses
all
the
friends
to
whom
jim
and
betty
were
commending
him
lived
in
new
york
and
cadwallader
hunter
had
said
that
most
new
yorkers
were
at
home
in
november
loveland
was
just
deciding
that
the
letters
had
better
reach
their
destination
before
night
when
his
baggage
appeared
looking
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
now
was
the
moment
when
the
inestimable
foxham
would
be
really
missed
on
shipboard
there
had
been
little
to
unpack
but
the
contents
of
the
portmanteaux
must
have
been
rudely
stirred
on
the
dock
and
ought
immediately
to
be
rescued
by
an
expert
loveland
touched
an
electric
bell
in
his
bedroom
demanded
of
an
unexpectedly
responsive
telephone
that
the
hotel
should
produce
a
valet
and
criticised
the
product
adversely
when
it
came
luncheon
time
was
near
and
val
was
hungry
but
he
would
not
leave
wardrobe
and
jewellery
to
the
discretion
of
a
strange
servant
in
a
mood
swinging
towards
impatience
he
sat
down
on
a
cushioned
sofa
to
watch
the
valet
proceedings
the
larger
of
the
two
noble
portmanteaux
was
opened
the
neat
square
of
and
coronetted
brown
velvet
with
which
foxham
always
covered
the
contents
of
each
box
was
removed
and
a
pile
of
clothing
was
deftly
excavated
loveland
face
changed
from
attention
to
surprise
then
to
bewilderment
by
jove
he
exclaimed
those
do
look
like
my
things
then
springing
up
alertly
he
began
to
toss
over
the
pile
as
the
hotel
valet
deposited
it
upon
the
bed
to
toss
it
over
as
a
haymaker
tosses
hay
but
in
the
midst
he
drew
back
his
hand
as
if
he
had
inadvertently
touched
pitch
jove
he
stammered
again
wrong
luggage
sir
ventured
the
servant
loveland
did
not
reply
he
did
not
even
hear
for
his
thoughts
had
taken
a
trip
of
record
quickness
across
the
sea
and
were
already
in
london
chasing
a
mystery
but
if
the
valet
had
stopped
to
think
an
answer
would
have
been
unnecessary
the
keys
fitted
the
portmanteaux
and
there
were
the
big
initials
and
the
small
coronets
which
distinguished
lord
loveland
property
from
the
vulgar
trunks
of
the
common
herd
had
foxham
gone
mad
for
the
moment
loveland
could
think
of
no
other
explanation
the
portmanteau
was
filled
with
discarded
garments
many
of
which
loveland
had
given
to
foxham
at
parting
other
things
were
there
too
which
val
dimly
remembered
having
actually
seen
on
the
person
of
foxham
and
it
was
from
the
touch
of
these
contaminated
remnants
that
he
recoiled
in
disgust
open
the
other
portmanteau
he
directed
flushed
now
and
the
hotel
servant
obeyed
another
neat
square
of
brown
velvet
was
whisked
away
and
piles
of
shirts
were
revealed
but
save
for
a
deceitful
top
layer
they
were
not
loveland
shirts
they
might
have
been
bought
in
the
edgware
road
probably
had
been
by
foxham
there
was
underclothing
also
but
not
the
pale
pink
blue
and
heliotrope
silk
variety
affected
by
foxham
master
now
the
hat
box
loveland
went
on
almost
sure
that
he
was
talking
in
his
sleep
for
it
was
unbelievable
that
he
would
not
soon
wake
up
to
find
that
this
was
a
bad
dream
there
were
hats
in
the
hat
box
foxham
hats
perhaps
certainly
not
lord
loveland
and
in
the
boot
box
which
came
next
were
boots
but
boots
which
had
lost
all
claim
to
boots
which
even
foxham
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
give
away
only
the
custom
house
official
good
nature
and
haste
and
complete
absence
of
mind
on
the
dock
had
delayed
discovery
until
this
moment
but
now
that
the
secret
was
out
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
if
not
to
rage
helplessly
loveland
spluttered
a
few
colourful
words
but
was
still
too
bewildered
by
the
catastrophe
to
become
volcanic
the
eruption
would
follow
later
what
shall
i
do
with
the
things
sir
the
valet
wanted
to
know
do
with
them
repeated
loveland
exasperated
by
the
calmness
pitch
into
the
fire
get
rid
of
them
anyhow
out
of
my
sight
and
be
quick
about
it
i
been
robbed
by
my
own
man
loveland
seemed
to
hear
these
words
spoken
by
an
unknown
voice
as
if
they
had
been
uttered
by
a
stranger
and
instantly
he
accepted
them
as
the
solution
of
the
mystery
that
was
it
foxham
had
robbed
him
foxham
had
not
gone
mad
foxham
was
simply
a
scoundrel
there
was
too
much
method
in
the
planning
of
this
trick
even
for
madness
the
careful
arrangement
of
the
cabin
luggage
with
all
the
right
things
in
the
right
places
except
for
the
containing
tie
pins
sleeve
links
and
shirt
studs
which
for
five
days
loveland
had
believed
to
have
been
stowed
away
somewhere
else
by
mistake
the
packing
of
the
portmanteaux
and
boxes
with
a
nice
judgment
as
to
their
proper
weight
and
the
neatness
of
top
layers
all
this
was
too
well
thought
out
to
be
the
work
of
a
lunatic
no
wonder
foxham
had
not
asked
for
wages
in
arrear
no
wonder
he
suddenly
developed
a
defunct
grandfather
with
an
eccentric
will
from
the
moment
he
heard
of
the
proposed
trip
to
america
he
must
have
been
quietly
planning
this
a
worth
making
for
the
sake
of
the
bran
new
wardrobe
to
say
nothing
of
the
jewellery
and
hot
with
rage
loveland
ran
over
in
his
mind
the
contents
of
that
missing
the
pearl
studs
which
lady
kitty
manning
had
given
him
on
his
last
birthday
each
one
of
the
three
worth
fifty
pounds
if
it
was
worth
a
shilling
how
he
wished
he
had
sold
the
things
as
he
had
been
tempted
to
do
and
would
have
done
if
they
had
not
been
the
gift
of
a
pretty
woman
the
diamond
and
enamel
too
and
the
sapphire
buttons
a
hundred
pounds
more
in
foxham
pocket
then
the
cravat
pins
in
two
long
rows
on
a
white
velvet
background
loveland
could
see
them
as
he
had
seen
them
last
a
cherished
collection
representing
not
only
so
many
golden
sovereigns
but
so
many
queens
of
beauty
the
charming
givers
what
a
rogue
to
send
his
master
off
to
a
strange
country
stripped
practically
naked
and
how
the
master
longed
to
have
the
rogue
within
kicking
distance
instead
of
safe
across
the
sea
forgotten
faults
of
foxham
flashed
back
into
his
memory
small
slynesses
winked
at
or
condoned
rumoured
airs
assumed
in
the
servants
hall
at
country
houses
fibs
found
out
and
overlooked
because
no
other
valet
had
foxham
skill
and
resourcefulness
still
who
would
have
expected
such
depravity
if
this
blow
had
fallen
on
some
other
man
loveland
would
have
laughed
and
chaffed
him
but
he
was
far
from
seeing
his
own
predicament
as
a
laughing
matter
he
was
like
a
knight
of
old
who
having
journeyed
to
a
far
land
to
joust
for
a
great
prize
finds
himself
robbed
of
his
armour
how
was
he
to
fight
on
the
tilting
ground
of
society
and
bear
away
a
millionairess
when
his
sole
possessions
consisted
of
what
he
stood
up
in
and
the
contents
of
a
and
a
cabin
trunk
luckily
foxham
had
not
been
able
to
annex
his
master
letter
of
credit
but
val
had
uses
for
the
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
other
than
buying
a
new
outfit
how
he
wished
now
that
he
had
not
played
bridge
quite
so
often
on
board
ship
emptying
his
pockets
of
spare
cash
the
scrape
he
was
in
was
as
hard
to
win
out
of
as
a
black
london
fog
and
while
groping
for
light
a
mild
question
from
the
hotel
valet
did
not
sweeten
his
temper
am
i
really
to
carry
all
these
things
away
sir
oh
go
to
the
devil
and
take
them
with
you
the
servant
lest
he
remember
that
he
had
been
born
a
man
and
retaliate
bolted
towards
safety
with
a
leaning
tower
of
garments
on
his
arm
it
was
nobody
business
how
he
meant
to
dispose
of
them
and
a
second
later
he
would
have
passed
the
danger
line
had
not
a
page
boy
selected
that
identical
instant
to
knock
at
lord
door
man
and
youth
collided
the
pile
of
clothing
crumbled
into
ruin
foxham
loathed
shirts
and
waistcoats
blotting
out
the
threshold
what
the
valet
said
long
habits
of
servitude
rendered
inaudible
but
what
loveland
said
might
have
been
heard
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
there
were
listeners
nearer
major
cadwallader
hunter
and
a
companion
who
represented
one
of
new
york
leading
newspapers
chapter
ten
the
valley
of
disappointment
major
cadwallader
hunter
had
been
somewhat
doubtful
of
his
wisdom
in
paying
this
uninvited
call
he
had
hinted
that
he
might
drop
in
at
the
waldorf
to
see
how
lord
loveland
got
on
and
had
not
been
encouraged
to
do
so
but
tony
kidd
of
new
york
light
was
a
pretty
good
excuse
for
persevering
and
he
certainly
had
been
badly
in
want
of
an
excuse
having
cast
himself
for
the
part
of
it
was
imperative
that
society
should
know
who
led
the
bear
whether
the
bear
recognised
his
position
or
not
had
he
like
loveland
been
merely
a
guest
in
america
he
would
have
left
the
ship
dock
when
lord
loveland
left
and
have
been
able
to
show
all
whom
it
concerned
at
the
that
loveland
was
his
property
but
he
was
subjected
by
the
dreaded
custom
house
officials
to
treatment
very
different
from
that
meted
out
to
the
englishman
being
baited
and
bullied
as
if
he
were
a
bear
instead
of
a
the
detention
however
proved
a
blessing
in
disguise
for
it
gave
him
anthony
kidd
of
light
the
journalist
sent
down
by
his
paper
to
meet
the
had
just
exhausted
the
available
supply
of
millionaires
when
he
spied
major
cadwallader
hunter
and
carelessly
culled
him
by
the
way
as
worth
a
short
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
a
column
cadwallader
hunter
was
glad
of
a
paragraph
anywhere
but
thought
he
saw
his
way
to
one
higher
up
perhaps
even
with
a
headline
so
he
happened
to
mention
a
connection
of
his
the
marquis
of
loveland
who
had
been
on
board
though
for
reasons
the
noble
name
did
not
appear
on
the
passenger
list
and
kidd
took
the
bait
loveland
was
described
by
his
alleged
cousin
as
a
dear
boy
so
handsome
so
clever
one
of
the
oldest
peerages
in
england
et
cetera
et
cetera
in
the
grenadier
guards
do
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
had
gone
on
ahead
to
secure
rooms
at
the
though
invitations
had
been
showered
upon
him
by
the
best
people
on
board
ship
as
soon
as
he
could
escape
with
life
and
luggage
cadwallader
hunter
intended
to
pay
a
friendly
call
and
inspect
lord
loveland
new
quarters
of
course
kidd
wanted
to
call
too
and
get
a
story
for
his
paper
but
at
this
suggestion
the
shook
his
head
charming
fellow
as
loveland
was
when
you
knew
him
he
was
rather
a
difficult
man
to
approach
and
had
some
ridiculous
prejudice
against
american
pressmen
certainly
unless
influence
were
brought
to
bear
he
would
refuse
to
see
kidd
but
cadwallader
hunter
would
like
to
do
light
a
good
turn
and
give
the
paper
a
chance
for
a
scoop
he
would
take
kidd
under
his
wing
and
use
his
persuasive
powers
to
obtain
some
sort
of
an
interview
perhaps
there
was
more
confidence
in
his
manner
than
in
his
mind
as
he
made
this
offer
for
the
bear
leader
had
already
seen
the
claws
but
the
risk
was
worth
running
and
when
arrived
at
the
waldorf
he
had
talked
for
a
few
minutes
with
pleasant
condescension
to
a
hotel
clerk
his
had
so
risen
that
he
no
longer
dreaded
a
cold
reception
nor
did
he
receive
one
his
welcome
was
on
the
contrary
far
warmer
than
he
had
expected
and
the
hot
blast
of
loveland
wrath
swept
him
back
a
step
or
two
so
that
he
trod
hard
upon
tony
kidd
most
pampered
toe
a
difficult
young
man
to
approach
indeed
the
representative
of
new
york
light
was
a
brilliant
journalist
with
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
a
headline
jumped
into
his
head
as
cadwallader
hunter
stamped
upon
his
toe
a
difficult
young
man
to
approach
he
thought
he
saw
his
way
to
something
rather
choice
for
tomorrow
light
somehow
between
valet
and
page
the
wild
litter
of
shirts
trousers
boots
and
other
horrors
reminiscent
of
foxham
was
into
a
tower
more
leaning
than
before
then
while
the
valet
scuttled
away
with
his
trailing
sliding
load
the
page
remained
behind
and
courageously
announced
the
visitors
perhaps
if
foxham
had
spared
him
a
few
of
his
favourite
tie
pins
or
if
the
blow
of
his
loss
had
not
caught
him
on
an
empty
stomach
loveland
might
have
seen
the
humour
of
the
situation
as
tony
kidd
saw
it
but
everything
was
against
him
in
a
black
world
and
his
late
intrusion
with
a
stranger
was
the
one
last
drop
in
a
bitter
cup
which
he
refused
to
swallow
never
had
cadwallader
hunter
handsome
bear
looked
less
handsome
or
more
dangerous
than
he
looked
as
he
stood
blocking
the
way
to
his
den
at
bay
against
fate
and
against
his
leader
my
dear
fellow
what
has
happened
to
upset
you
exclaimed
cadwallader
hunter
warned
by
loveland
expression
that
the
only
hope
lay
in
getting
the
first
word
upset
me
echoed
val
glaring
blue
fire
so
vindictively
that
kidd
expected
his
introducer
to
be
the
next
one
upset
my
d
d
valet
has
stolen
all
my
clothes
and
made
me
a
present
of
his
own
that
all
how
shocking
sympathised
cadwallader
hunter
well
yes
it
is
rather
a
shock
returned
loveland
drily
and
if
you
do
mind
i
think
i
better
ask
you
to
let
me
get
over
it
alone
oh
certainly
i
quite
understand
purred
the
banished
courtier
but
kidd
was
making
mental
notes
and
cadwallader
hunter
strove
to
retain
his
reputation
as
a
valued
cousin
just
a
minute
or
two
dear
boy
and
we
take
ourselves
off
this
is
kidd
from
one
of
our
most
important
papers
happy
to
see
him
another
time
snapped
loveland
just
now
i
in
no
temper
to
entertain
strangers
but
at
least
cadwallader
hunter
protested
you
must
look
on
me
as
a
stranger
my
dear
fellow
and
if
there
anything
i
can
do
my
dear
fellow
loveland
flung
back
at
him
in
angry
mimicry
if
you
keep
on
i
more
likely
to
look
on
you
as
a
bore
the
one
thing
you
can
do
for
me
is
to
go
and
take
your
newspaper
friend
with
you
good
morning
and
the
bear
shot
back
into
his
den
banging
the
door
illustration
one
thing
you
can
do
for
me
is
to
go
and
take
your
newspaper
friend
with
the
british
lion
before
his
midday
meal
remarked
the
representative
of
new
york
light
another
minute
and
he
have
snatched
a
free
lunch
kidd
with
hunter
sauce
but
serve
me
up
on
toast
if
he
has
got
sauce
enough
of
his
own
he
comes
of
a
family
cadwallader
hunter
explained
his
english
relative
i
should
say
they
been
hot
ever
since
william
the
conqueror
commented
kidd
good
family
to
keep
away
from
when
you
have
got
your
gun
i
forgot
mine
this
morning
but
he
had
not
forgotten
his
stylographic
pen
the
moment
that
the
door
had
slammed
loveland
ears
tingled
with
the
consciousness
that
not
only
had
he
been
guilty
of
a
very
rude
act
but
a
particularly
stupid
one
he
had
never
liked
cadwallader
hunter
had
lately
grown
tired
and
sick
of
him
and
detested
him
cordially
now
for
a
peppery
second
or
two
yet
all
this
did
not
do
away
with
nothing
could
excuse
forgetfulness
of
one
obligation
the
obligation
to
be
a
gentleman
and
loveland
was
irritably
aware
that
he
had
forgotten
it
he
reminded
himself
that
a
great
liberty
had
been
taken
with
him
at
an
inopportune
moment
that
he
was
not
used
to
having
liberties
taken
with
him
at
the
best
of
times
and
that
cadwallader
hunter
deserved
all
he
had
got
for
coming
up
to
him
uninvited
with
a
stranger
a
newspaper
man
in
tow
still
val
was
not
happy
and
if
he
had
not
been
too
stubbornly
proud
to
yield
to
his
first
impulse
he
would
have
flung
open
the
door
and
run
after
his
visitors
with
apologies
but
no
he
would
not
do
it
a
bad
precedent
to
make
with
a
person
like
cadwallader
hunter
he
said
excusing
himself
the
major
would
take
advantage
of
it
and
as
for
the
journalist
he
lord
loveland
stood
on
purple
heights
so
lofty
that
he
need
fear
no
spiteful
yapping
of
dogs
on
lower
levels
nothing
could
drag
him
down
to
their
depths
and
as
his
idea
was
that
american
newspaper
men
were
no
slaves
to
truth
he
told
himself
that
this
one
would
probably
have
lied
in
any
case
with
such
thoughts
vaguely
stirring
in
his
mind
and
assured
that
cadwallader
hunter
past
civility
had
been
entirely
for
what
he
could
get
loveland
tried
to
friendly
relations
with
his
own
conscience
but
the
uneasy
pricking
would
not
stop
it
drove
him
up
and
down
in
and
out
of
one
beautifully
furnished
room
to
another
in
irrepressible
restlessness
and
a
presentiment
of
worse
things
to
come
than
he
had
yet
suffered
he
had
meant
when
his
unpacking
was
done
to
dress
and
lunch
in
the
restaurant
whose
fame
had
reached
even
the
of
the
club
but
that
was
before
the
nightmare
now
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
his
or
be
looked
at
and
he
pressed
his
electric
bell
viciously
to
order
luncheon
sent
up
it
came
presently
and
would
have
been
delicious
to
a
man
without
a
grievance
but
loveland
grievance
was
so
gigantic
that
it
had
crowded
out
his
appetite
and
scarcely
knowing
what
he
ate
he
went
through
course
after
course
brooding
on
his
wrongs
and
pondering
the
chances
of
revenge
useless
to
waste
money
in
cabling
instructions
for
foxham
arrest
he
reflected
the
wretch
who
had
planned
everything
so
well
would
long
ago
have
taken
himself
out
of
harm
way
and
it
would
be
like
setting
scotland
yard
to
look
for
a
very
small
rusty
needle
in
a
haystack
as
big
as
england
and
the
continent
to
expect
the
thievish
valet
to
be
found
months
ago
in
an
expansive
moment
when
loveland
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
listen
while
his
boots
were
being
laced
foxham
had
confessed
that
at
one
time
he
had
been
an
actor
in
a
humble
way
his
speciality
had
been
quick
disguises
lightning
changes
and
he
had
been
successful
in
a
turn
done
at
provincial
music
halls
loveland
could
imagine
foxham
disguising
himself
very
well
and
being
almost
as
good
an
actor
as
he
had
been
a
valet
he
was
perhaps
masquerading
now
as
a
salvation
army
preacher
or
a
beauty
specialist
or
setting
up
as
a
grocer
on
the
money
got
by
the
betrayal
of
his
master
no
loveland
decided
he
need
not
hope
to
punish
foxham
his
time
might
be
better
employed
in
planning
the
reconstruction
of
his
own
wardrobe
a
man
even
a
marquis
can
live
without
tie
pins
or
a
change
of
shirt
studs
but
he
can
not
live
without
such
clothes
as
society
expects
of
him
loveland
thought
with
almost
passionate
regret
of
his
achievements
lost
to
him
for
ever
and
with
anxiety
of
the
difficult
matter
it
would
be
to
replace
them
the
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
represented
by
his
letter
of
credit
could
not
be
spared
for
american
tailors
and
bootmakers
that
went
without
saying
these
persons
would
have
to
trust
him
but
were
american
tailors
and
bootmakers
of
a
trusting
nature
loveland
had
somehow
got
the
impression
that
they
were
not
and
that
even
if
you
were
a
duke
much
less
a
marquis
and
flaunted
a
copy
of
burke
under
their
noses
they
would
still
want
some
native
millionaire
to
guarantee
them
against
loss
cadwallader
hunter
was
not
a
millionaire
this
was
the
one
damaging
statement
he
had
voluntarily
made
against
himself
but
he
knew
millionaires
and
was
known
by
them
and
with
a
pang
of
selfish
regret
even
sharper
than
his
first
remorse
loveland
repented
his
wastefulness
in
throwing
away
such
a
friend
if
he
had
not
slammed
the
door
almost
upon
cadwallader
hunter
high
thin
nose
he
might
now
have
summoned
him
by
telephone
and
have
got
him
to
trot
about
introducing
the
marquis
of
loveland
to
the
best
tailors
in
new
york
of
course
the
major
would
not
accept
the
snub
as
final
he
was
not
that
sort
of
person
but
it
was
beneath
the
loveland
dignity
to
insult
a
man
and
then
ask
a
favour
of
him
the
only
thing
for
val
to
do
was
to
wait
until
he
had
collected
other
friends
more
solid
more
valuable
than
cadwallader
hunter
and
as
soon
as
possible
tell
the
tale
of
his
misfortunes
of
course
everybody
would
be
delighted
to
help
lord
loveland
and
by
the
way
there
was
coolidge
who
could
be
approached
if
worst
came
to
worst
but
worst
had
not
yet
come
to
worst
and
as
val
spirits
rose
with
a
mingling
of
good
food
and
bright
hopes
he
decided
against
coolidge
as
a
refuge
for
the
present
in
spite
of
all
he
would
stick
to
his
guns
and
not
forgather
further
with
the
people
until
he
had
seen
what
harborough
letters
produced
he
could
get
on
for
a
day
or
two
and
meanwhile
there
were
things
to
do
when
he
had
been
cheered
by
luncheon
and
soothed
by
cigarettes
he
sent
for
a
motor
the
afternoon
was
still
young
and
so
full
of
sparkle
and
gayety
that
life
seemed
worth
living
after
all
therefore
lord
loveland
had
begun
to
value
himself
almost
as
highly
as
ever
by
the
time
his
smart
little
automobile
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
bank
it
was
a
stately
bank
well
worthy
of
its
london
connection
and
he
handed
in
his
visiting
card
and
letter
of
credit
with
the
air
of
one
entitled
to
receive
unlimited
sums
the
cashier
however
having
looked
at
him
the
card
and
the
letter
did
not
appear
to
be
impressed
instead
of
replying
in
words
to
loveland
demand
for
twenty
pounds
he
walked
away
with
the
letter
of
credit
in
his
hand
and
vanished
behind
a
swing
door
loveland
thought
that
he
had
probably
gone
to
fetch
the
manager
who
would
perhaps
desire
to
see
in
person
a
titled
client
of
some
importance
but
after
a
short
delay
the
cashier
returned
alone
and
having
strolled
back
to
his
place
behind
the
grating
there
stood
silent
for
a
moment
i
rather
in
a
hurry
said
loveland
i
suppose
there
be
no
red
tape
about
my
getting
twenty
pounds
i
want
it
this
afternoon
the
cashier
smiled
a
dry
smile
and
his
voice
sounded
dry
as
he
answered
i
do
know
about
the
red
tape
but
i
sorry
to
tell
you
we
have
no
instructions
from
london
to
pay
what
cried
val
reddening
with
annoyance
several
people
writing
cheques
or
waiting
for
money
at
the
counter
looked
up
and
continued
to
look
you
have
no
instructions
no
instructions
to
pay
repeated
the
cashier
putting
on
the
last
word
an
emphasis
which
sounded
offensive
to
loveland
ears
though
he
hastily
assured
himself
that
it
could
not
possibly
have
any
such
meaning
this
is
very
inconvenient
said
val
to
whom
bridge
and
tips
on
shipboard
had
left
exactly
seventeen
shillings
three
pence
halfpenny
i
sorry
for
that
remarked
the
cashier
still
more
formally
more
unsympathetically
and
one
might
almost
have
said
more
disrespectfully
than
before
loveland
though
inclined
to
storm
reflected
a
moment
he
had
intended
to
sail
on
the
which
was
due
to
leave
english
shores
only
yesterday
and
might
not
arrive
at
new
york
for
seven
or
eight
days
he
had
not
given
anyone
notice
not
even
his
mother
that
he
had
changed
his
intention
and
very
likely
the
london
papers
had
paragraphed
him
as
a
passenger
on
the
next
trip
nevertheless
he
could
not
quite
understand
how
that
fact
excused
his
london
bank
delay
in
instructing
their
new
york
correspondents
they
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
arrange
his
affairs
before
his
sudden
departure
in
the
and
by
not
doing
so
they
were
likely
to
make
him
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
again
he
thought
of
cadwallader
hunter
in
this
instance
too
the
man
might
have
been
useful
well
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
made
to
suffer
because
the
london
and
southern
bank
puts
off
till
tomorrow
what
it
ought
to
have
done
a
week
ago
said
loveland
beginning
to
be
arrogant
though
looking
boyish
with
his
flushed
face
and
his
white
scar
glimmering
on
its
background
of
clear
i
must
have
some
money
you
know
the
cashier
did
not
reply
to
this
challenge
and
his
eyes
expressed
no
interested
consideration
of
the
matter
you
had
better
see
your
manager
and
explain
the
circumstances
pursued
val
it
would
be
useless
we
could
not
pay
without
instructions
i
daresay
i
might
manage
with
ten
pounds
till
you
could
get
an
answer
if
you
choose
to
be
so
ridiculously
loveland
insisted
loftily
but
in
that
case
you
must
cable
at
once
you
will
no
doubt
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
message
in
advance
suggested
the
cashier
certainly
not
said
val
no
longer
trying
to
keep
his
temper
under
control
you
seen
my
card
is
that
enough
for
you
business
is
business
quoted
the
bank
employé
still
unruffled
still
blind
to
lord
loveland
importance
cold
to
his
necessities
and
decency
decency
stormed
val
careless
now
who
looked
or
listened
and
in
a
mood
to
wreck
all
american
institutions
yes
it
as
well
never
to
forget
that
the
cashier
hinted
significantly
sorry
we
can
not
accommodate
you
at
present
i
hanged
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
again
retorted
val
snatching
his
letter
of
credit
from
the
counter
i
shall
myself
send
a
cable
to
the
london
and
southern
which
will
make
you
repent
your
and
with
this
ultimatum
he
strode
to
the
door
as
if
on
the
way
to
sign
a
by
his
looks
that
will
be
an
expensive
cable
and
make
the
wire
mighty
hot
val
heard
a
man
chuckle
as
he
passed
and
there
was
a
spatter
of
laughter
which
for
his
eyes
painted
the
opposite
bright
scarlet
beastly
america
beastly
americans
he
muttered
i
suppose
this
is
their
way
of
resenting
the
existence
of
aristocracy
lord
loveland
had
a
good
deal
to
learn
yet
about
america
and
also
about
that
important
member
of
the
aristocracy
himself
as
he
returned
to
his
motor
cab
which
had
been
taxing
away
violently
since
he
left
it
he
wondered
if
he
would
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
it
but
what
if
he
had
he
could
tip
the
chauffeur
and
the
hotel
would
do
the
rest
also
the
hotel
would
put
down
the
cash
for
a
dozen
cablegrams
oh
the
sting
of
these
would
last
no
longer
than
the
poison
of
once
jim
harborough
friends
began
to
rally
round
him
and
vie
among
each
other
for
his
society
as
the
mauretanians
had
done
new
york
would
be
his
to
play
with
patience
then
and
shuffle
the
cards
as
he
had
heard
someone
say
on
shipboard
faint
heart
never
won
a
game
of
poker
it
was
thus
he
smoothed
away
the
sulky
frown
which
suited
neither
his
face
nor
the
gentle
sunshine
then
trying
to
forget
the
first
snub
man
had
ever
dared
to
deal
him
he
flashed
here
and
there
in
his
motor
cab
making
a
house
to
house
distribution
of
jim
envelopes
and
his
own
visiting
cards
according
to
home
custom
when
armed
with
letters
of
introduction
the
sky
flamed
with
sunset
banners
spanish
colours
long
before
he
had
finished
his
round
and
was
ready
to
return
to
the
waldorf
there
his
idea
of
a
suitable
present
to
the
chauffeur
left
him
with
the
american
equivalent
of
eight
or
nine
shillings
in
his
pocket
but
as
he
had
expected
the
hotel
paid
for
his
afternoon
motoring
so
cheerfully
did
it
pay
that
he
sent
off
an
unnecessarily
long
and
extremely
frank
cablegram
to
his
london
bankers
which
they
ought
to
receive
on
opening
their
doors
next
morning
he
thought
that
it
would
rather
wake
them
up
and
that
in
consequence
of
their
response
to
new
york
certain
to
flash
immediately
along
the
wires
he
would
receive
an
apology
from
the
rude
wretch
who
had
insulted
him
that
afternoon
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
forget
or
forgive
he
had
informed
the
london
bankers
that
his
business
must
be
diverted
into
another
channel
which
they
were
invited
to
suggest
when
loveland
found
himself
alone
again
in
his
luxurious
suite
of
rooms
with
the
november
night
coming
on
and
no
amusement
on
hand
unless
he
chose
to
stare
down
from
his
high
windows
at
the
blaze
of
astonishing
jewels
which
festooned
the
immense
blue
dusk
with
light
and
colour
he
half
wished
once
more
that
he
had
not
been
so
cautious
in
the
matter
of
accepting
invitations
after
all
it
would
have
compromised
his
future
if
he
had
gone
to
dine
with
the
coolidges
or
flirtatious
milton
and
her
gentle
little
daughter
fanny
a
dinner
with
them
or
even
with
the
dullest
people
who
had
invited
him
would
have
been
preferable
to
an
undiluted
dose
of
his
own
society
on
this
first
night
in
a
strange
land
however
it
was
too
late
to
reconsider
now
with
dignity
though
he
was
childishly
confident
that
any
of
his
american
acquaintances
would
have
been
entranced
had
he
suddenly
changed
his
mind
and
the
next
best
thing
to
dining
with
friends
would
be
to
watch
the
coming
and
going
of
gay
new
york
in
the
restaurant
he
dressed
and
went
down
about
eight
therefore
looking
forward
to
the
novelty
of
the
unknown
chapter
eleven
the
discovery
of
lord
loveland
by
america
it
was
a
brilliant
scene
into
the
midst
of
which
loveland
plunged
society
begins
to
dine
earlier
in
new
york
than
in
london
therefore
at
eight
dinner
was
in
full
swing
there
was
scarcely
an
empty
table
and
many
of
the
women
being
in
hats
and
dress
the
red
and
gold
restaurant
suggested
to
the
newcomer
a
living
picture
of
paris
he
had
had
the
forethought
to
telephone
down
and
order
a
table
to
be
kept
for
him
and
informing
an
interrogative
waiter
that
he
was
lord
loveland
he
learned
that
his
place
would
be
found
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
it
looked
a
very
far
end
indeed
gazing
across
an
intervening
sea
of
flowerlike
hats
charming
faces
and
jewelled
necks
that
glimmered
white
under
film
of
lace
and
tulle
but
loveland
was
not
shy
among
all
the
men
who
protected
the
charming
faces
his
sweeping
faintly
supercilious
glance
did
not
show
him
one
whose
physical
advantages
he
need
envy
he
rather
enjoyed
his
progress
winding
on
and
on
along
narrow
paths
between
tables
with
lovely
eyes
lifting
to
his
as
he
passed
by
he
wondered
if
any
pair
of
those
eyes
was
destined
to
look
down
his
own
table
at
loveland
castle
some
day
well
they
should
be
beautiful
eyes
to
deserve
the
honour
the
thought
slipped
vaguely
through
his
head
and
then
his
own
eyes
brightened
with
the
light
of
recognition
there
at
a
large
table
decorated
with
white
and
purple
violets
sat
elinor
coolidge
her
father
milton
and
fanny
and
two
men
whom
loveland
had
never
seen
before
standing
and
bending
slightly
down
to
talk
in
a
confidential
tone
with
one
of
these
men
was
major
cadwallader
hunter
his
back
was
turned
towards
loveland
who
recognised
him
instantly
however
by
the
set
of
his
high
military
shoulders
and
the
bald
spot
on
his
head
which
lesley
dearmer
had
likened
to
the
shape
of
italy
on
the
map
he
seemed
to
listen
with
deep
interest
to
what
one
of
the
seated
men
was
saying
and
then
to
chime
in
eagerly
with
some
addition
of
his
own
everyone
at
the
table
was
absorbed
in
the
conversation
between
these
two
and
as
loveland
came
nearer
he
saw
that
the
expression
of
all
the
faces
including
those
of
the
three
ladies
was
so
grave
as
to
appear
out
of
keeping
with
the
liveliness
of
the
scene
suddenly
however
loveland
caught
fanny
milton
eye
she
started
and
blushed
scarlet
the
slight
involuntary
movement
she
made
drew
miss
coolidge
attention
and
elinor
seeing
the
direction
in
which
eyes
were
turned
sent
a
glance
that
way
loveland
within
bowing
distance
now
met
the
glance
and
returned
it
smiling
he
was
annoyed
that
cadwallader
hunter
should
be
with
the
party
even
though
evidently
not
of
it
yet
after
all
he
said
to
himself
perhaps
it
was
as
well
he
did
not
mean
to
apologise
to
cadwallader
hunter
for
he
thought
his
own
rudeness
more
or
less
justified
by
the
liberty
the
other
had
taken
but
he
had
already
made
up
his
mind
that
the
next
time
he
met
the
man
he
would
act
as
if
nothing
disagreeable
had
happened
as
to
cadwallader
hunter
readiness
to
snatch
at
the
olive
branch
loveland
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
he
thought
he
had
only
to
hold
out
a
hand
for
the
major
to
kiss
it
grovelling
elinor
coolidge
did
not
blush
at
the
sight
of
lord
loveland
as
fanny
milton
did
but
her
beautiful
face
changed
curiously
its
lines
hardened
her
lips
were
pressed
together
and
her
large
eyes
narrowed
gleaming
like
topazes
between
their
dark
lashes
as
the
lights
from
the
shaded
candles
on
the
table
lighted
sparks
in
their
depths
the
thought
flashed
into
loveland
head
that
the
quick
change
in
her
face
meant
jealousy
of
fanny
milton
he
had
noticed
more
than
once
on
shipboard
that
she
had
seemed
jealous
of
fanny
and
now
that
deep
blush
of
the
younger
girl
at
sight
of
him
had
probably
vexed
her
he
could
not
attribute
the
hardening
of
the
beautiful
features
to
any
other
cause
and
as
of
the
two
it
was
wise
to
prefer
elinor
and
her
millions
to
fanny
and
her
thousands
he
let
his
first
look
his
first
words
be
for
the
coolidges
father
and
daughter
how
do
he
asked
pausing
at
the
table
instead
of
answering
or
putting
out
her
hand
to
him
as
he
expected
elinor
almost
convulsively
grasped
the
sticks
of
a
delicate
little
fan
which
lay
beside
her
plate
she
shot
a
topaz
glance
at
one
of
the
two
new
men
then
let
her
eyes
under
raised
brows
seek
and
hold
her
father
lord
loveland
was
at
once
surprised
and
puzzled
by
this
extraordinary
reception
can
cadwallader
hunter
have
told
them
all
some
lie
to
set
them
against
me
he
asked
himself
but
it
was
no
more
than
a
passing
thought
it
was
incredible
that
miss
coolidge
should
believe
anything
against
him
at
the
sound
of
loveland
voice
cadwallader
hunter
straightened
up
in
haste
and
turned
round
looking
suddenly
stiff
and
wicked
as
a
frozen
snake
he
stared
into
loveland
eyes
his
own
like
grey
glass
and
an
unpromising
smile
depressed
the
corners
of
his
thin
lips
oh
that
it
is
it
thought
val
with
the
carelessness
of
a
man
used
to
dominating
situations
he
afraid
i
not
going
to
speak
to
him
and
he
dare
speak
first
for
fear
of
being
snubbed
again
well
and
val
felt
pleasantly
magnanimous
i
give
him
a
lead
how
are
you
he
asked
with
the
patronising
tone
his
voice
unconsciously
took
when
he
spoke
to
this
man
then
he
could
hardly
believe
his
eyes
which
told
him
that
cadwallader
hunter
had
turned
a
contemptuous
shoulder
upon
him
darting
disgust
in
a
venomous
glance
this
is
the
person
we
were
speaking
of
he
said
to
the
dark
man
towards
whom
he
had
been
bending
he
seemed
always
to
be
bending
towards
someone
when
loveland
came
up
shall
we
have
him
turned
out
coolidge
half
rose
in
his
seat
losing
his
characteristic
stolidity
no
no
he
returned
in
a
low
decided
voice
there
must
be
no
scene
here
for
the
ladies
sake
keep
quiet
everybody
you
right
coolidge
returned
the
dark
man
then
the
latter
fixed
his
eyes
on
loveland
with
a
stare
under
a
frown
and
the
other
new
man
stared
also
but
the
three
women
looked
away
trying
in
vain
to
think
of
something
easy
and
natural
to
say
to
each
other
a
slight
nervous
twitching
which
occasionally
disturbed
the
tranquillity
of
milton
face
became
visible
elinor
coolidge
was
pale
and
motionless
and
fanny
eyes
swam
in
a
lake
of
tears
which
she
struggled
to
keep
from
again
it
struck
loveland
that
he
was
living
in
a
dream
the
gorgeous
room
the
crowd
of
men
and
beautiful
women
the
hurrying
waiters
the
lights
the
fragrance
of
flowers
and
food
and
scented
laces
the
chatter
of
laughing
voices
subdued
by
distance
and
more
unreal
than
all
the
table
surrounded
by
the
faces
that
he
knew
faces
he
had
expected
to
find
smiling
in
friendship
now
frozen
into
something
like
horror
horror
at
him
lord
loveland
whom
everybody
had
always
wanted
and
admired
it
could
not
be
true
it
was
not
happening
really
things
like
this
did
not
happen
he
stood
for
a
moment
stupidly
like
a
boy
in
the
who
has
been
bidden
to
stand
up
and
be
stared
at
as
a
punishment
for
some
misdemeanour
he
was
almost
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
insolence
of
cadwallader
hunter
as
a
lion
might
laugh
at
a
fox
terrier
worrying
his
foot
it
was
on
his
lips
to
say
what
a
tempest
in
a
surely
you
not
going
to
believe
any
idiotic
tale
that
ass
may
have
trumped
up
about
me
but
he
bit
back
the
words
if
they
chose
to
champion
cadwallader
hunter
in
his
silly
grievance
against
a
marquis
of
loveland
why
let
them
they
would
be
sorry
afterwards
when
it
was
too
late
to
sneer
cadwallader
hunter
down
as
he
deserved
would
be
to
make
a
disagreeable
scene
and
the
business
was
squalid
enough
already
he
would
have
thought
better
of
the
coolidges
if
not
of
the
miltons
mother
and
daughter
but
he
said
to
himself
that
none
of
them
were
worth
even
the
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
gave
as
with
his
head
held
gallantly
high
he
passed
on
towards
his
own
table
the
little
dramatic
episode
if
observed
by
any
audience
had
been
played
too
subtly
to
be
understood
by
those
not
concerned
those
seated
nearest
might
have
seen
that
when
a
handsome
young
man
stopped
to
speak
to
some
members
of
a
party
at
a
table
another
man
who
did
not
belong
to
that
party
had
looked
at
him
scornfully
and
whispered
venomously
that
then
one
or
two
others
had
spoken
hurriedly
and
that
the
handsome
young
man
had
stalked
away
apparently
in
disgust
but
several
of
the
neighbours
knew
the
party
at
the
table
by
sight
and
cadwallader
hunter
also
these
consulted
together
and
wondered
who
was
the
tall
young
man
who
looked
like
an
englishman
the
women
commented
flatteringly
upon
his
face
or
his
figure
but
the
men
were
of
the
opinion
that
judging
by
the
way
cadwallader
hunter
pepys
junior
they
called
him
had
eyed
the
chap
he
must
be
the
rankest
kind
of
an
outsider
there
were
two
chairs
at
loveland
in
case
he
might
choose
to
bring
a
guest
and
he
deliberately
selected
the
one
which
put
him
with
his
back
to
the
coolidge
party
but
he
had
forgotten
that
major
cadwallader
hunter
was
not
one
of
that
party
and
might
wander
at
will
to
any
part
of
the
presently
he
did
begin
to
wander
stopping
to
talk
with
another
group
of
people
then
with
another
and
so
on
always
on
his
way
somewhere
else
loveland
utterly
sick
now
of
his
late
friend
did
not
bestow
a
glance
upon
the
thin
figure
as
it
paused
and
flitted
flitted
and
paused
like
a
fastidious
bee
in
a
a
polite
waiter
had
slipped
a
menu
into
the
hand
of
loveland
who
regarded
the
decorated
square
of
cardboard
as
if
it
were
a
fetish
to
preserve
him
from
evil
but
if
he
had
deigned
to
let
his
eye
follow
cadwallader
hunter
he
would
have
seen
that
each
group
of
people
glanced
with
furtive
curiosity
at
him
stared
whispered
stared
again
and
afterwards
signalled
each
other
from
table
to
table
across
flowery
spaces
lifting
eyebrows
and
exchanging
signs
of
a
secret
intelligence
cadwallader
hunter
prided
himself
on
knowing
all
the
people
who
were
worth
knowing
wherever
he
went
and
those
he
did
not
know
at
the
start
he
generally
contrived
to
know
at
the
finish
he
had
at
least
twenty
or
thirty
acquaintances
in
the
restaurant
of
the
tonight
and
having
heard
from
one
of
these
a
startling
piece
of
news
which
would
have
been
less
welcome
yesterday
he
dropped
bits
of
the
rich
here
and
there
as
he
made
his
way
towards
the
door
he
had
dined
early
because
he
had
been
minded
to
show
himself
rather
late
at
the
first
performance
of
a
new
comedy
by
the
brilliant
young
playwright
sidney
cremer
but
now
he
found
himself
appearing
on
the
stage
and
acting
almost
a
leading
part
in
a
drama
a
hundred
times
more
exciting
than
he
could
see
at
any
theatre
he
went
straight
from
the
restaurant
to
the
long
row
of
desks
in
the
hotel
office
for
a
heart
to
heart
talk
with
the
clerk
he
had
interviewed
in
the
morning
then
having
made
the
impression
and
obtained
the
assurance
he
desired
he
searched
for
other
acquaintances
in
that
vast
decorative
corridor
of
marble
facetiously
known
as
peacock
alley
he
knew
several
of
the
best
peacocks
there
for
there
were
all
kinds
from
north
south
west
and
east
to
many
of
whom
cadwallader
hunter
would
not
have
deigned
to
bow
even
if
they
were
smeared
with
gold
and
dipped
in
diamonds
and
he
talked
to
those
of
his
choice
more
loudly
than
he
had
talked
in
the
acquaintances
whom
he
and
strangers
who
could
catch
the
drift
of
what
he
was
saying
listened
with
interest
and
then
sat
or
stood
about
with
the
air
of
expecting
that
some
exciting
event
might
happen
meanwhile
loveland
ordered
his
dinner
though
not
quite
as
carefully
as
he
would
had
it
not
been
for
the
disagreeable
little
incident
which
he
tried
to
forget
as
if
it
were
but
one
more
in
the
series
of
as
he
had
no
money
at
present
to
pay
for
it
he
thought
he
might
as
well
drown
his
vexations
in
champagne
and
asked
for
a
bottle
of
the
brand
he
liked
best
without
even
enquiring
the
new
york
conception
of
its
price
as
the
waiter
would
have
gone
off
with
the
order
val
called
him
back
on
a
sudden
thought
do
you
know
the
names
of
the
people
at
the
table
where
i
stopped
yes
sir
replied
the
man
they
are
very
well
known
here
we
often
have
them
dining
and
lunching
coolidge
is
a
millionaire
he
and
his
daughter
are
just
back
from
europe
and
and
miss
milton
too
yes
yes
said
loveland
impatiently
i
know
all
that
but
the
others
oh
the
smooth
shaved
gentleman
with
the
black
hair
and
prominent
eyes
he
milton
milton
husband
rather
a
gay
sort
of
gentleman
sir
the
story
is
he
and
milton
do
get
along
very
pleasantly
there
be
plenty
here
tonight
will
be
interested
seeing
them
together
just
after
her
coming
home
with
the
young
lady
and
the
other
gentleman
sir
the
young
one
with
the
dark
moustache
that
one
of
our
greatest
new
york
swells
henry
van
cotter
he
thank
you
that
will
do
broke
in
loveland
suddenly
annoyed
by
the
servant
knowing
loquacity
the
name
of
henry
van
cotter
had
in
such
a
connection
stirred
a
dim
sense
of
discomfort
within
him
this
van
cotter
was
one
of
harborough
friends
val
had
left
jim
letter
and
a
visiting
card
this
afternoon
at
a
huge
palace
of
an
apartment
house
where
van
cotter
had
a
flat
the
waiter
thus
checked
trotted
away
with
the
order
for
dinner
and
was
so
long
in
returning
that
val
who
did
not
see
him
stopped
and
harangued
by
a
superior
wondered
and
grew
impatient
other
people
were
served
while
he
still
sat
idle
he
was
not
hungry
for
an
angry
tingling
in
his
veins
had
burnt
up
his
appetite
for
dinner
as
his
keenness
for
luncheon
had
been
destroyed
but
he
resented
being
kept
waiting
as
if
he
were
a
person
of
no
importance
at
last
he
saw
his
waiter
coming
back
and
was
about
to
ask
irritably
whether
the
man
thought
it
was
tomorrow
breakfast
he
ordered
when
a
sealed
envelope
of
the
hotel
paper
was
laid
on
the
table
in
place
of
the
expected
oysters
the
servant
discreetly
retired
out
of
sight
behind
his
lordship
chair
like
a
little
boy
who
has
lit
a
squib
and
awaits
the
explosion
and
loveland
tore
open
the
envelope
which
very
oddly
he
thought
was
not
addressed
he
had
a
vague
expectation
that
the
contents
would
prove
to
be
a
note
from
cadwallader
hunter
and
the
reality
came
upon
him
as
a
complete
surprise
sir
he
read
in
neat
typing
the
management
of
the
hotel
presents
its
compliments
and
informs
you
that
the
suite
you
are
occupying
will
be
required
from
this
evening
also
that
they
regret
they
have
no
other
room
to
place
at
your
disposal
they
therefore
enclose
your
account
up
to
date
and
request
the
favour
of
immediate
payment
should
you
wish
for
dinner
and
wine
they
would
be
obliged
if
you
would
kindly
pay
in
advance
the
bill
for
same
as
ordered
by
you
is
enclosed
separately
from
the
other
account
now
surely
he
would
at
last
wake
up
from
this
wild
nightmare
and
find
himself
at
home
in
england
or
still
on
the
ship
nothing
had
seemed
real
since
he
landed
and
could
not
be
real
foxham
could
not
have
stolen
his
clothes
the
new
york
bank
could
not
have
refused
to
give
him
money
cadwallader
hunter
could
not
have
induced
henry
van
cotter
the
coolidges
and
miltons
to
cut
him
and
above
all
the
hotel
he
honoured
with
his
patronage
could
not
have
flung
in
his
face
this
monstrous
insult
nevertheless
there
was
the
bill
staring
up
at
him
as
he
stared
down
at
it
private
parlour
bedroom
and
bath
luncheon
served
à
la
carte
in
parlour
wine
cablegram
sent
to
london
southern
bank

three
hours
total

as

and
to
be
paid
in

champagne
lord
loveland
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
or
did
in
the
persistent
nightmare
from
which
he
could
not
wake
called
the
waiter
to
him
from
ambush
behind
his
chair
the
man
came
with
eyes
cast
patiently
down
not
to
meet
the
angry
blaze
turned
dangerously
upon
him
he
knew
that
something
was
wrong
very
wrong
indeed
but
it
was
not
his
affair
except
that
he
was
consumed
with
honest
curiosity
and
he
did
not
wish
grievances
to
be
visited
on
him
there
must
be
some
mistake
here
said
loveland
folding
up
the
paper
and
replacing
the
three
sheets
in
the
envelope
with
fingers
that
were
not
quite
steady
this
ca
be
for
me
you
see
there
no
name
on
the
thing
you
brought
it
to
the
wrong
person
no
o
sir
returned
the
servant
i
was
told
to
bring
it
to
you
if
there
a
mistake
sir
it
is
me
who
made
it
very
well
then
somebody
else
has
insisted
loveland
i
tell
you
this
ca
possibly
be
meant
for
me
give
the
envelope
back
to
whoever
gave
it
to
you
and
ask
him
to
hand
it
to
the
manager
saying
that
in
error
it
was
delivered
to
lord
loveland
yes
sir
the
waiter
obediently
took
charge
of
the
offensive
envelope
and
ambled
away
with
it
to
confer
at
a
distance
with
the
person
from
whom
it
had
been
received
five
minutes
ago
there
were
a
few
gestures
a
few
shrugs
and
then
the
two
approached
lord
loveland
table
together
it
quite
right
sir
murmured
the
newcomer
the
letter
for
you
sir
there
no
mistake
as
if
by
way
of
reminder
he
gently
laid
the
envelope
down
on
the
table
in
the
place
where
those
iced
blue
points
never
would
be
now
deadly
white
under
his
brown
tan
val
rose
without
a
word
crumpling
the
envelope
in
a
hand
that
itched
to
clutch
someone
by
the
throat
and
flinging
down
a
silver
dollar
for
the
waiter
the
coolidges
and
their
party
were
still
at
the
table
as
loveland
passed
by
but
he
did
not
see
them
he
had
forgotten
their
existence
papa
the
major
done
it
exclaimed
elinor
coolidge
looking
across
at
her
father
who
sat
between
milton
and
fanny
yes
he
has
done
it
replied
coolidge
smiling
the
wooden
smile
which
was
of
fair
carved
ivory
when
reproduced
on
the
beautiful
face
of
his
daughter
i
do
know
what
come
over
the
major
since
this
morning
he
seemed
to
love
that
englishman
like
a
son
on
board
the
but
tonight
he
fairly
jumped
out
of
himself
with
joy
when
he
heard
van
cotter
piece
of
news
i
sure
we
were
all
as
nice
as
we
could
be
to
lord
to
faltered
fanny
milton
who
had
drained
the
lake
from
her
eyes
when
no
one
was
looking
but
only
to
make
way
it
seemed
for
a
new
supply
of
salt
water
oh
speak
for
yourself
fanny
said
milton
with
her
exaggerated
english
accent
as
for
me
i
why
mamma
you
were
just
to
him
every
minute
cried
the
girl
defending
herself
briskly
if
you
were
married
with
a
daughter
people
might
have
thought
you
were
in
love
with
him
yourself
sometimes
nonsense
retorted
fanny
mother
darting
a
furious
look
at
her
child
the
way
you
talk
shows
you
grown
up
i
always
thought
he
was
the
most
conceited
young
man
i
ever
saw
broke
in
elinor
coolidge
i
could
have
boxed
his
ears
often
and
it
would
have
served
him
right
i
just
enjoy
this
it
like
a
play
well
i
think
that
real
mean
of
you
elinor
said
fanny
and
i
do
see
how
you
can
feel
that
way
he
looks
so
pale
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
what
he
got
to
go
through
poor
fellow
and
he
so
handsome
did
you
ever
see
anything
as
beautiful
as
he
looked
just
now
when
he
went
stalking
by
us
with
his
head
high
and
his
face
pale
and
his
eyes
like
blue
fire
i
certainly
never
saw
a
british
as
handsome
they
do
make
like
that
said
henry
van
cotter
and
then
they
all
laughed
all
except
fanny
milton
she
was
wondering
what
lesley
dearmer
would
do
if
she
were
here
tonight
instead
of
tearing
away
towards
louisville
as
fast
as
an
express
train
could
carry
her
lesley
had
been
loveland
friend
in
quite
an
unpretending
humble
little
way
knowing
that
she
was
no
match
for
him
and
never
could
be
but
lesley
was
a
strange
girl
she
thought
of
such
odd
original
things
to
do
would
she
do
anything
odd
and
original
if
she
were
here
now
and
if
she
did
would
it
be
for
or
against
the
man
who
was
down
as
it
happened
lesley
was
thinking
of
lord
loveland
at
that
very
moment
perhaps
it
was
a
kind
of
telepathy
which
brought
her
image
so
clearly
before
fanny
milton
eyes
for
lesley
thoughts
included
fanny
it
was
not
yet
time
for
the
coloured
porters
to
begin
making
down
the
beds
in
the
sleeping
cars
and
lesley
and
her
aunt
sat
opposite
one
another
each
with
a
book
in
her
hand
loveland
had
a
story
of
the
south
as
she
could
dimly
remember
it
before
the
civil
war
and
she
was
reading
with
interest
half
sad
half
pleased
lesley
had
a
novel
too
one
which
had
been
making
quite
a
sensation
while
she
was
in
europe
and
her
aunt
had
bought
it
for
her
in
the
grand
central
station
before
taking
the
train
she
had
often
said
that
she
would
like
to
read
the
book
but
now
though
her
eyes
travelled
from
one
line
to
another
and
she
mechanically
turned
a
page
here
and
there
she
did
not
even
know
the
names
of
the
characters
or
what
they
were
saying
or
doing
the
panting
of
the
great
engine
and
the
rushing
roar
of
the
wheels
had
come
to
have
a
refrain
for
her
never
again
never
again
she
heard
them
say
as
if
the
words
were
shouted
spitefully
into
her
ears
never
see
him
again
never
again
he
forget
you
forget
you
soon
marry
marry
some
rich
girl
then
she
wondered
who
the
rich
girl
would
be
elinor
coolidge
perhaps
elinor
was
very
rich
and
very
beautiful
and
already
very
proud
everything
about
her
was
superlative
a
great
many
glowing
descriptive
adjectives
were
called
for
when
one
only
thought
about
elinor
and
lesley
experience
as
a
had
made
her
expert
with
adjectives
painfully
expert
it
seemed
now
as
her
imagination
ran
ahead
even
ahead
of
the
rushing
train
to
picture
elinor
as
a
bride
oh
i
sure
she
would
make
him
happy
lesley
thought
and
then
asked
herself
whether
lord
loveland
deserved
to
be
happy
no
of
course
he
did
deserve
happiness
with
a
girl
he
married
for
money
yet
lesley
could
bear
to
think
of
him
as
miserable
or
disappointed
in
life
the
brilliant
sparks
which
showered
past
the
train
windows
seemed
to
her
like
the
moments
she
had
spent
with
loveland
moments
left
behind
for
ever
now
and
she
could
not
help
wishing
that
she
might
live
them
over
again
perhaps
i
might
have
helped
him
to
be
different
if
i
tried
she
said
to
herself
as
she
watched
the
specks
of
fire
which
flashed
and
died
but
i
try
i
was
too
proud
to
try
i
suppose
it
was
a
silly
kind
of
pride
for
he
could
be
he
could
be
such
a
if
he
knew
himself
and
would
live
up
to
himself
elinor
could
not
help
him
to
do
that
she
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
dream
of
the
existence
of
that
real
self
of
which
lesley
had
fancied
she
caught
glimpses
sometimes
as
if
behind
a
veil
that
never
had
been
torn
aside
miss
coolidge
would
be
well
enough
satisfied
with
lord
loveland
as
he
was
for
she
would
only
want
from
him
material
things
such
things
as
she
could
afford
to
buy
with
her
money
and
if
they
married
the
bright
loveableness
in
val
nature
would
be
clouded
and
obscured
he
would
grow
hard
and
wholly
selfish
but
with
fanny
milton
if
he
should
marry
her
it
was
just
as
lesley
asked
herself
this
question
that
fanny
thoughts
flew
to
lesley
wondering
what
lesley
would
do
if
she
saw
lord
loveland
held
up
to
public
scorn
fanny
would
love
him
lesley
reflected
but
her
mind
paused
at
that
but
and
she
took
herself
to
task
for
mean
jealousy
because
it
was
in
her
head
or
her
heart
that
fanny
would
not
love
him
in
the
way
best
for
his
highest
development
she
spoil
and
pet
him
and
make
him
worse
than
he
is
now
because
it
a
strong
tonic
not
a
diet
of
sugar
that
he
needs
and
if
he
said
a
cross
word
or
looked
at
another
woman
fanny
would
cry
although
lesley
knew
that
all
this
was
true
still
she
was
afraid
that
jealousy
of
a
girl
looked
upon
by
lord
loveland
as
eligible
was
really
the
foundation
of
her
argument
i
jealous
she
admitted
although
i
have
no
right
to
be
i
could
have
made
him
care
enough
about
me
to
lose
his
head
and
say
that
if
promise
to
marry
him
he
count
the
world
well
lost
oh
yes
i
could
have
done
that
i
know
it
but
how
would
he
have
felt
the
minute
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
he
have
regretted
them
bitterly
and
thought
himself
mad
then
even
if
i
said
which
i
would
have
said
of
course
he
have
thought
forever
with
a
kind
of
wild
horror
of
the
narrow
escape
he
had
and
all
his
memory
of
me
would
have
been
spoiled
oh
i
glad
glad
i
kept
it
to
friendship
from
first
to
last
and
laughed
at
him
always
i
told
him
that
he
forget
and
that
i
wanted
him
to
forget
but
i
do
and
he
wo
just
because
we
were
friends
and
because
i
laughed
and
was
different
from
the
others
remember
even
years
from
now
when
he
married
and
the
world
has
given
him
all
it
can
of
course
lesley
ought
not
to
have
been
glad
that
loveland
would
remember
her
as
the
one
dear
blessing
he
had
been
denied
and
think
of
her
when
it
would
be
more
suitable
that
he
should
be
thinking
of
his
marchioness
but
she
was
glad
with
a
kind
of
fierce
gladness
that
hurt
and
made
her
young
face
look
strained
in
the
crude
white
light
of
the
dear
me
lesley
that
must
be
an
exciting
book
complained
aunt
barbara
i
spoken
to
you
twice
without
your
hearing
i
so
sorry
dear
said
lesley
what
it
about
asked
the
elder
woman
who
had
dutifully
put
away
her
novel
because
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
about
echoed
lesley
oh
about
love
and
marrying
the
wrong
people
what
a
pity
sighed
aunt
barbara
i
do
think
stories
ought
all
to
end
well
do
you
some
ca
said
the
girl
it
would
be
for
the
best
i
suppose
if
they
did
you
look
tired
dear
said
loveland
how
happy
and
peaceful
we
shall
feel
when
we
at
home
again
i
wonder
answered
lesley
but
she
whispered
the
words
too
softly
for
aunt
barbara
to
hear
chapter
twelve
exit
lord
loveland
loveland
walked
out
of
the
of
the
hardly
knowing
what
he
meant
to
do
his
wish
was
to
punish
those
who
had
insulted
him
but
how
was
the
question
ringing
in
his
brain
a
gentleman
could
not
knock
down
a
management
or
punch
its
head
a
management
seemed
intangible
out
of
reach
val
first
thought
was
to
march
up
to
the
desk
and
have
a
row
with
somebody
but
an
instant
reflection
showed
him
that
it
would
be
more
in
accordance
with
dignity
to
go
to
his
own
quarters
and
command
a
representative
of
the
management
to
come
to
him
this
resolve
he
carried
out
having
reached
his
room
and
called
down
through
the
telephone
for
the
manager
he
was
not
kept
waiting
long
before
a
gentlemanly
person
appeared
at
his
door
are
you
the
manager
of
this
hotel
loveland
enquired
brusquely
i
represent
the
manager
the
newcomer
returned
very
well
then
said
loveland
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
and
he
indicated
the
typewritten
letter
and
the
two
bills
which
he
had
laid
conspicuously
on
the
table
the
man
scarcely
glanced
at
the
papers
about
which
he
was
evidently
well
informed
already
the
meaning
is
that
unfortunately
we
obliged
to
request
that
you
vacate
this
suite
immediately
he
replied
then
this
notice
is
actually
intended
for
me
it
certainly
is
why
were
the
rooms
let
to
me
this
morning
if
they
were
wanted
tonight
that
i
ca
say
i
only
know
they
are
wanted
suppose
i
refuse
to
go
oh
i
guess
you
wo
do
that
you
right
said
val
i
would
stop
here
now
if
you
paid
twelve
times
as
much
as
you
want
me
to
pay
and
by
the
way
i
ca
pay
tonight
you
have
to
wait
till
tomorrow
when
i
can
get
to
the
er
bank
i
afraid
we
ca
wait
the
other
answered
quickly
if
you
able
to
pay
we
shall
have
to
keep
your
baggage
till
you
do
loveland
stared
that
a
little
too
steep
is
it
he
sneered
you
turn
me
out
of
your
hotel
in
the
most
insulting
and
unprovoked
manner
and
then
expect
me
to
go
somewhere
else
without
my
luggage
are
these
american
manners
with
foreigners
they
have
to
be
with
some
foreigners
returned
the
other
smiling
mysteriously
i
intend
to
go
now
whether
you
like
or
not
said
val
and
take
my
luggage
with
me
you
ca
take
it
unless
you
pay
your
bill
that
the
law
and
our
police
know
how
to
enforce
it
if
i
were
you
i
would
do
anything
to
make
it
necessary
to
call
the
police
once
in
their
hands
you
might
be
quite
a
while
getting
out
you
know
loveland
clenched
his
hands
to
keep
from
striking
this
of
the
management
he
would
not
be
drawn
into
a
vulgar
brawl
as
a
preface
to
his
new
york
campaign
in
search
of
an
heiress
things
had
begun
badly
enough
as
they
were
but
nothing
had
happened
yet
at
which
he
might
not
be
able
to
laugh
rather
bitterly
perhaps
tomorrow
he
had
heard
of
horrors
in
connection
with
the
new
york
police
innocent
british
visitors
arrested
and
kept
for
days
in
gaol
for
some
offence
never
committed
the
newspapers
printing
lies
about
them
to
be
copied
in
london
and
read
by
their
shocked
acquaintances
such
things
he
had
been
told
and
though
they
might
be
true
loveland
could
not
afford
to
risk
any
such
incident
for
himself
he
was
far
too
important
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
a
peculiar
significance
almost
a
menace
in
the
hint
he
had
just
been
given
if
he
were
a
criminal
escaping
from
justice
instead
of
a
british
peer
with
a
proud
name
which
he
would
willingly
bestow
on
a
daughter
of
america
just
such
an
emphasis
might
have
been
used
to
warn
him
that
he
had
better
bear
the
ills
he
knew
if
he
did
not
want
to
incur
worse
evils
val
believed
that
cadwallader
hunter
had
somehow
contrived
to
bring
about
this
hideous
state
of
affairs
though
he
could
not
imagine
how
unless
all
americans
were
ready
to
band
together
and
avenge
one
another
fancied
wrongs
against
a
stranger
on
the
face
of
it
nothing
could
be
more
ridiculous
than
to
suppose
that
an
englishman
of
title
was
being
asked
to
leave
a
new
york
hotel
in
the
evening
because
he
had
been
a
little
rude
to
a
retired
major
and
a
newspaper
man
in
the
morning
yet
for
his
life
loveland
could
think
of
no
other
reason
and
his
polite
but
cold
companion
did
not
seem
inclined
to
explain
unless
in
answer
to
undignified
entreaties
my
luggage
is
worth
a
lot
more
than
what
i
owe
you
here
he
said
we
have
heard
all
about
that
luggage
was
the
meaning
reply
val
bit
his
lip
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
foxham
treachery
but
he
remembered
it
now
with
recurring
rage
evidently
the
valet
had
poured
forth
the
history
of
the
great
unpacking
episode
lord
loveland
made
no
retort
to
the
innuendo
for
he
was
busy
with
a
mental
calculation
his
sole
worldly
possessions
in
america
consisted
of
the
things
he
had
had
in
use
on
board
ship
the
luggage
itself
was
old
though
good
of
its
kind
and
the
silver
fittings
in
his
would
not
fetch
much
if
sold
as
for
his
watch
it
was
a
mere
cheap
affair
of
bought
to
tide
over
the
interval
until
he
could
redeem
the
gold
repeater
he
had
rashly
pawned
in
london
the
studs
and
that
he
was
wearing
were
the
poorest
in
his
collection
they
had
been
foxham
choice
for
the
voyage
not
his
and
now
he
understood
foxham
underlying
motive
in
my
opinion
we
shall
be
lucky
if
the
sale
of
your
effects
covers
the
bill
calmly
went
on
the
representative
of
the
management
i
would
advise
your
people
to
try
and
sell
my
things
exclaimed
loveland
they
will
wait
the
customary
length
of
time
they
better
be
jolly
careful
what
they
do
loveland
broke
out
anyhow
i
much
mistaken
if
i
have
a
case
in
law
against
the
hotel
already
if
i
have
and
in
justice
i
ought
to
have
i
shall
proceed
the
other
smiled
for
the
first
time
i
do
expect
that
any
of
us
will
lie
awake
nights
worrying
said
he
loveland
tried
to
crush
the
man
with
a
look
but
he
was
not
to
be
so
easily
abashed
i
said
all
i
want
to
say
now
val
informed
him
icily
you
can
go
and
i
will
give
up
the
rooms
when
i
ready
that
all
right
as
long
as
it
inside
half
an
hour
returned
the
other
still
with
unruffled
politeness
but
i
have
to
stay
till
you
do
give
them
up
why
this
fondness
for
my
society
enquired
loveland
with
raised
eyebrows
the
man
smiled
with
a
certain
perception
of
the
humour
in
the
situation
it
duty
keeps
me
as
much
as
pleasure
said
he
welcome
the
coming
speed
the
parting
guest
eh
this
hotel
seems
to
follow
that
rule
with
a
vengeance
but
i
take
the
will
for
the
deed
strange
as
it
may
seem
loveland
was
enjoying
his
own
sarcasm
i
you
to
go
very
sorry
i
ca
oblige
you
confound
you
do
you
think
i
set
the
place
on
fire
the
minute
your
back
is
turned
not
so
much
that
as
there
are
other
things
you
might
do
what
other
things
really
i
should
like
to
know
for
the
sake
of
curiosity
well
if
you
bound
to
get
it
out
of
me
i
got
to
stay
and
see
you
do
remove
any
articles
of
value
by
jove
so
that
it
my
own
or
yours
what
yours
is
ours
at
present
and
what
ours
is
our
own
as
the
bride
said
to
the
bridegroom
val
could
almost
have
laughed
though
not
at
the
joke
he
the
marquis
of
loveland
an
officer
in
the
grenadier
guards
was
to
be
watched
lest
he
should
steal
the
hotel
soap
or
sneak
off
with
his
own
toothbrush
he
went
white
and
red
and
white
again
if
by
a
word
he
could
have
tumbled
the
whole
hotel
down
in
an
earthquake
he
would
have
been
willing
to
be
caught
under
the
ruins
he
had
a
wild
boyish
conviction
that
by
subjecting
himself
now
to
the
extremest
inconvenience
he
could
by
and
by
cause
the
hotel
management
poignant
remorse
yes
he
would
take
them
at
their
word
he
would
walk
out
of
the
house
just
as
he
was
leaving
everything
he
had
behind
him
this
would
make
their
guilt
the
blacker
when
it
came
to
be
brought
up
against
them
as
it
would
be
very
soon
probably
as
soon
as
tomorrow
then
they
would
seek
him
out
and
crawl
in
apology
begging
him
to
come
back
at
any
price
or
at
no
price
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
cross
the
threshold
of
the
again
no
not
even
if
every
member
of
the
staff
grovelled
at
his
feet
he
would
not
even
take
his
overcoat
and
if
he
were
struck
down
with
pneumonia
so
much
the
worse
for
these
insolent
people
as
for
himself
he
did
not
care
what
happened
he
felt
as
he
had
when
a
little
boy
and
some
tutor
of
unusual
firmness
had
dared
to
reproach
him
or
attempt
punishment
at
such
times
he
had
wished
that
he
might
instantly
die
or
at
the
least
fall
in
a
fit
for
the
sake
of
frightening
his
cruel
persecutor
his
cap
his
only
as
he
had
forgotten
a
bowler
on
board
ship
lay
on
a
table
and
he
held
it
out
for
the
enemy
inspection
you
say
all
that
is
mine
is
yours
he
sneered
this
may
have
cost
six
or
seven
shillings
when
it
was
new
now
it
would
fetch
two
at
most
i
will
pay
you
for
it
half
a
crown
is
the
least
i
have
pray
keep
the
change
he
laid
a
coin
his
last
large
coin
down
on
the
table
where
the
cap
had
been
and
without
another
word
walked
nonchalantly
out
of
the
room
the
gentlemanly
man
did
not
follow
to
protest
or
to
offer
the
overcoat
as
val
half
fancied
he
would
do
and
without
stopping
to
think
coherently
loveland
passed
by
the
lift
scorning
to
take
advantage
of
its
convenience
and
ran
down
flight
after
flight
of
stairs
his
blood
drumming
in
his
ears
a
red
cloud
before
his
eyes
seemed
to
screen
him
from
the
world
below
in
the
great
hall
through
which
he
had
to
pass
on
his
way
out
of
the
hotel
lights
glared
and
dazzled
and
the
talk
and
laughter
of
many
persons
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
evil
voices
of
the
black
stones
that
beset
arabian
nights
travellers
on
their
way
to
the
singing
tree
and
the
golden
water
loveland
pushed
on
blindly
conscious
of
himself
as
the
one
real
entity
in
a
crowd
of
will
o
the
wisps
and
wicked
his
sole
concern
with
the
people
in
the
hateful
glaring
picture
was
that
they
should
suspect
nothing
of
his
feelings
he
walked
with
his
head
up
and
something
that
he
meant
for
a
smile
on
his
lips
nor
was
it
an
affectation
that
he
appeared
to
recognize
no
one
though
cadwallader
hunter
who
had
been
waiting
to
see
this
exit
believed
it
to
be
the
major
was
standing
almost
in
loveland
path
speaking
with
a
lady
whose
name
had
been
on
one
of
jim
harborough
envelopes
and
as
the
tall
englishman
came
towards
him
he
deliberately
turned
his
back
sic
semper
milordibus
he
said
half
aloud
which
witticism
made
the
lady
laugh
chapter
thirteen
shadows
the
night
was
warm
for
november
in
new
york
still
there
was
a
decided
crispness
in
the
air
which
loveland
felt
as
he
went
out
the
streets
were
brilliant
with
light
and
half
new
york
appeared
to
be
abroad
although
the
theatres
had
been
in
full
swing
for
nearly
an
hour
but
all
the
women
wore
cloaks
and
the
men
overcoats
loveland
in
his
dinner
jacket
and
wide
expanse
of
shirt
front
his
pumps
and
silk
stockings
his
cloth
travelling
cap
pulled
over
his
eyes
would
have
been
noticeable
even
if
his
height
and
good
looks
had
not
made
him
a
marked
figure
everybody
who
passed
stared
and
more
than
a
few
glanced
back
at
him
here
and
there
some
pretty
woman
laughed
at
a
joking
comment
whispered
by
her
escort
and
when
his
first
hot
rage
began
to
cool
it
was
uncomfortably
borne
in
upon
loveland
that
he
was
the
observed
of
many
observers
like
most
englishmen
he
loathed
being
conspicuous
and
in
his
present
plight
it
was
especially
hateful
since
being
conspicuous
meant
also
to
be
ridiculous
his
ears
shut
by
anger
were
opened
by
vanity
and
he
heard
a
woman
say
to
a
man
that
he
looked
as
if
he
just
been
turned
down
by
his
best
girl
and
kicked
out
by
pa
added
her
companion
at
which
they
both
giggled
and
the
tingling
in
loveland
veins
drove
out
the
chill
which
had
begun
to
creep
in
he
longed
to
call
a
cab
and
hide
himself
from
staring
eyes
but
he
had
scarcely
a
shilling
left
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
walk
on
until
he
found
some
hotel
which
would
take
him
in
on
trust
as
his
brain
cooled
he
began
to
realise
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
any
such
hotel
here
he
was
on
a
winter
night
a
foreigner
in
a
strange
city
walking
the
streets
without
an
overcoat
and
with
only
a
coin
or
two
in
his
pocket
he
remembered
that
in
the
afternoon
when
dealing
out
visiting
cards
and
letters
of
introduction
he
had
slipped
his
cardcase
into
a
pocket
of
his
overcoat
where
it
still
remained
that
overcoat
remained
in
one
of
the
rooms
lately
his
at
the
what
a
fool
he
had
been
after
all
to
leave
it
behind
the
watcher
could
hardly
have
torn
it
off
his
back
as
it
was
a
whim
of
silly
pride
had
deprived
him
of
a
means
of
identification
as
well
as
a
decent
protection
for
his
body
why
should
a
consent
to
take
him
in
without
luggage
and
with
nothing
save
his
bare
word
not
even
a
bit
of
engraved
pasteboard
to
prove
that
he
was
the
marquis
of
loveland
he
had
never
put
himself
mentally
in
the
place
of
anything
so
low
down
in
the
social
scale
as
the
keeper
of
a
hotel
yet
instinctively
he
performed
the
feat
now
and
judged
the
case
against
his
own
interests
nevertheless
as
he
did
not
wish
to
prowl
about
new
york
all
night
he
could
but
try
his
luck
meeting
a
policeman
he
enquired
for
a
respectable
inexpensive
hotel
in
a
quiet
street
not
too
far
away
and
did
his
best
to
look
unconscious
of
the
big
man
concentrated
gaze
fixed
on
the
large
white
oval
of
his
shirt
front
yez
might
try
the
new
house
on
toyty
thoyd
street
was
the
advice
that
followed
upon
reflection
and
loveland
was
obliged
to
ask
three
times
before
he
was
able
to
translate
toyty
thoyd
into
street
then
he
had
to
turn
and
retrace
his
steps
for
he
had
been
wandering
uptown
and
must
have
covered
some
distance
as
he
guessed
by
the
length
of
time
it
took
him
to
reach
the
again
coming
near
so
that
the
huge
building
loomed
above
him
like
a
mountain
flaming
on
all
its
heights
he
was
tempted
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
but
ashamed
of
the
impulse
as
childish
he
marched
stolidly
ahead
and
even
forced
himself
to
turn
his
face
towards
the
brilliant
square
of
the
as
the
light
caught
and
photographed
him
in
passing
a
man
who
had
been
standing
in
front
of
the
hotel
under
the
iron
canopy
with
the
air
of
waiting
for
someone
started
after
loveland
walking
just
fast
enough
to
keep
him
well
in
sight
val
turned
into
street
and
stopped
before
the
new
house
which
advertised
itself
in
a
blaze
of
starry
electric
letters
the
man
on
his
trail
smiled
as
he
saw
the
tall
figure
in
evening
dress
hesitate
for
an
instant
and
then
hurl
himself
at
a
revolving
door
he
himself
strolled
on
but
he
did
not
go
far
when
he
had
taken
a
dozen
steps
he
wheeled
passed
the
hotel
again
took
a
dozen
more
steps
and
again
came
back
he
was
a
short
man
with
square
shoulders
a
large
black
head
set
on
a
short
neck
into
which
a
double
chin
bulged
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
sponge
and
it
had
stuck
in
his
throat
as
it
expanded
his
hair
glittered
like
a
thick
coat
of
black
varnish
and
his
black
eyes
glittered
also
they
looked
out
from
under
heavy
lids
which
pouched
underneath
and
were
set
too
close
on
either
side
of
a
nose
he
was
clean
shaven
thus
making
the
most
of
his
best
feature
a
mouth
which
was
handsome
despite
the
hard
lines
that
deep
draughts
from
the
cup
of
life
had
traced
round
it
the
man
was
well
dressed
with
a
white
silk
scarf
protecting
his
evening
shirt
from
the
sealskin
lining
of
his
overcoat
and
he
looked
not
only
successful
but
confident
of
success
yet
there
was
anxiety
and
nervous
excitement
in
the
flash
of
his
eyes
towards
the
door
of
the
hotel
each
time
he
passed
and
repassed
it
was
when
he
had
just
taken
his
sixth
turn
that
loveland
shot
out
through
the
revolving
door
even
more
suddenly
than
he
had
shot
in
the
watcher
was
near
enough
to
see
the
look
on
his
face
the
tenseness
of
the
lips
and
drawing
together
of
the
eyebrows
and
his
own
expression
said
i
thought
so
as
plainly
as
words
if
there
had
been
anyone
there
to
read
it
but
loveland
was
entirely
absorbed
in
himself
and
in
bitter
thoughts
of
the
hateful
experience
he
had
just
gone
through
he
did
not
notice
the
man
who
lingered
not
far
away
and
the
few
people
passing
had
no
idea
that
a
little
drama
was
being
enacted
in
pantomime
under
their
eyes
they
all
looked
at
the
tall
young
englishman
without
an
overcoat
but
they
did
not
connect
the
other
man
with
him
it
was
hardly
to
be
hoped
that
there
would
be
a
room
disengaged
in
a
hotel
for
a
nervous
young
gentleman
with
an
exposed
white
no
luggage
and
a
missing
cardcase
when
val
had
explained
that
he
was
lord
loveland
just
landed
from
england
the
hotel
clerk
turned
away
to
hide
either
a
yawn
or
a
grin
and
seemed
no
more
inclined
to
remember
the
existence
of
an
unoccupied
bedroom
than
if
his
client
had
been
plain
smith
or
jones
we
had
a
gentleman
from
england
here
last
week
he
said
pleasantly
his
name
was
walker
london
sorry
we
ca
accommodate
your
lordship
then
loveland
had
squared
his
shoulders
and
marched
out
into
the
night
which
seemed
by
now
grimly
cold
and
unfriendly
the
very
stars
had
a
sarcastic
twinkle
as
if
they
glimmered
down
from
their
safe
comfortable
heights
and
laughed
val
was
not
inclined
to
try
any
more
hotels
he
felt
very
young
in
his
loneliness
and
humiliation
and
his
heart
yearned
wistfully
for
the
shabby
scotch
where
his
mother
lived
and
thought
long
thoughts
of
her
the
snow
that
had
fallen
so
coldly
outside
her
windows
seemed
warmer
than
these
stars
that
with
their
sparkling
embroidery
canopied
a
strange
land
and
the
sparsely
furnished
rooms
of
the
lodge
were
more
beautiful
in
his
remembrance
than
the
gorgeous
suite
at
the
his
mother
grudged
herself
comforts
for
his
sake
yet
she
had
a
fire
val
generally
pictured
her
in
autumn
and
winter
bending
towards
the
glow
of
the
rosy
flames
holding
out
her
beautifully
shaped
hands
to
their
kisses
he
would
be
thankful
to
share
the
warmth
of
that
fire
now
and
the
faint
scent
of
burning
peat
cheapest
fuel
as
it
stole
fragrantly
into
his
memory
gave
him
a
horrid
twinge
of
homesickness
such
as
he
had
never
felt
even
in
south
africa
for
he
had
had
friends
around
him
in
the
war
days
when
he
had
been
in
scotland
last
on
that
flying
visit
which
began
with
good
advice
and
ended
with
pink
pearls
he
had
complained
of
the
cooking
he
thought
of
that
too
at
this
moment
and
laughed
a
little
to
himself
he
would
have
been
very
glad
of
a
chance
to
taste
some
of
that
scotch
broth
which
he
had
discarded
because
it
was
too
thick
and
too
salt
he
was
sharply
hungry
and
this
hunger
gnawed
with
a
wicked
persistence
it
had
lacked
in
south
africa
because
in
those
stirring
times
it
had
been
shared
by
all
alike
merrily
with
jokes
yes
he
was
hungry
sickeningly
hungry
and
he
did
not
see
any
prospect
of
satisfying
his
appetite
that
night
unless
he
should
tear
the
gold
out
of
his
shirtcuffs
to
offer
humbly
in
some
cheap
restaurant
in
exchange
for
a
meal
they
were
not
worth
much
intrinsically
but
the
thought
of
the
cuffs
denuded
ignominious
and
the
picture
of
himself
metaphorically
swallowing
the
buttons
like
a
conjurer
so
revolted
his
fastidious
imagination
that
he
snatched
at
an
alternative
almost
any
alternative
so
it
was
that
when
something
which
his
mother
would
have
called
an
inspiration
floated
nebulously
through
his
head
loveland
welcomed
it
as
an
astronomer
welcomes
a
new
star
he
remembered
hearing
betty
or
jim
harborough
say
that
in
american
towns
a
man
might
call
upon
a
family
he
knew
well
up
to
the
hour
of
ten
in
the
evening
it
was
not
nearly
ten
yet
and
though
there
was
no
family
in
new
york
whom
val
knew
well
it
was
a
case
of
any
port
in
a
storm
the
coolidges
were
now
out
of
the
running
and
the
miltons
but
a
and
beverly
with
a
daughter
had
half
apologetically
invited
him
to
visit
at
their
house
in
park
avenue
they
were
rich
or
richish
though
with
a
trail
of
trade
behind
them
and
the
girl
was
pretty
or
prettyish
she
seemed
positively
beautiful
to
the
hungry
and
homeless
loveland
as
the
vision
of
her
face
lightened
the
cloud
of
his
misery
and
he
would
have
been
almost
ready
to
pledge
his
future
to
miss
beverly
for
a
mess
of
pottage
in
the
way
of
a
kindly
welcome
a
dinner
a
bed
and
money
in
hand
for
the
letter
of
credit
he
had
cannily
refused
the
invitation
pleading
many
engagements
difficult
to
keep
if
visiting
the
same
formula
had
answered
several
hospitable
offers
but
he
could
easily
explain
the
late
call
by
lightly
recounting
the
story
of
his
misfortune
making
a
jest
of
it
and
throwing
himself
on
the
family
mercy
he
hoped
and
believed
that
they
would
insist
upon
his
staying
all
night
in
their
house
also
that
a
loan
sufficient
to
pay
his
hotel
bill
and
redeem
his
luggage
might
be
suggested
the
prospect
of
release
from
all
his
woes
was
so
soothing
and
apparently
so
easy
to
compass
that
the
mere
thought
was
a
warming
cordial
val
walked
briskly
back
into
fifth
avenue
and
asked
the
way
of
the
first
man
he
met
the
man
was
amiable
and
loveland
felt
an
impulse
of
gratitude
towards
him
for
lucid
and
fluent
explanations
after
all
some
of
these
americans
had
very
agreeable
manners
val
found
park
avenue
a
dignified
street
and
with
the
pleasantest
anticipations
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
beverlys
house
the
number
of
which
had
fortunately
stuck
in
his
memory
there
were
lights
in
all
the
windows
of
the
two
lower
floors
and
as
he
pressed
the
electric
bell
he
saw
a
shadow
flit
across
the
half
transparent
silk
curtains
a
shadow
which
was
like
a
faint
silhouette
of
plump
little
madge
beverly
it
all
right
they
at
home
thank
goodness
he
said
to
himself
as
he
waited
for
the
door
to
open
and
a
sense
of
calm
fell
upon
him
with
the
assurance
that
his
troubles
were
over
at
last
it
was
like
the
joy
of
a
bad
sailor
when
the
bell
of
the
channel
boat
clangs
at
calais
after
a
hideous
welter
of
seas
in
crossing
a
neat
servant
was
soon
framed
against
a
yellow
background
of
cheerful
light
and
at
some
distance
screened
in
shadow
the
man
who
had
followed
loveland
waited
once
more
with
a
certain
anxiety
in
his
eyes
val
enquired
for
and
beverly
they
were
at
home
said
the
servant
in
the
living
room
with
a
party
of
relations
who
had
come
to
welcome
them
back
after
their
visit
to
europe
if
the
gentleman
would
step
into
the
reception
room
and
send
up
his
card
and
beverly
would
no
doubt
be
down
in
a
minute
but
when
people
are
at
home
one
does
send
in
one
card
said
loveland
arguing
according
to
english
ways
the
servant
trained
to
american
fashions
and
knowing
no
others
looked
surprised
at
this
statement
he
thought
the
tall
gentleman
without
an
overcoat
must
be
a
peculiar
person
and
he
had
been
taught
to
distrust
peculiar
persons
tell
your
master
and
mistress
that
lord
loveland
has
called
but
will
not
keep
them
long
from
their
friends
said
val
growing
impatient
under
the
man
narrow
look
the
servant
resented
the
suggestion
that
as
a
free
man
in
a
free
country
he
could
have
a
master
and
mistress
and
a
lord
anybody
sounded
like
a
practical
joke
to
him
for
though
he
had
begun
by
being
a
swede
he
had
been
an
american
since
he
was
however
he
was
well
trained
according
to
his
lights
and
the
family
traditions
of
the
beverlys
he
ushered
the
practical
joker
into
a
handsome
and
vanished
upstairs
to
explain
the
odd
young
gentleman
who
never
announced
himself
with
cards
the
parlour
was
a
very
nice
parlour
tastefully
furnished
there
were
portraits
of
and
beverly
facing
each
other
upon
the
walls
and
the
lady
picture
evidently
painted
many
years
ago
so
poignantly
suggested
what
madge
would
be
at
her
age
that
loveland
was
alarmed
i
do
anything
else
to
show
my
gratitude
except
marry
the
daughter
he
was
making
up
his
mind
in
advance
when
the
servant
returned
with
a
grave
face
indeed
it
could
not
have
been
more
solemn
if
he
had
come
to
break
the
news
that
all
lord
loveland
surviving
relatives
had
perished
together
in
a
holocaust
and
beverly
are
very
sorry
sir
said
the
man
but
they
are
too
much
engaged
to
see
anybody
tonight
val
rose
haughtily
his
pride
and
his
hopes
had
both
received
another
severe
rap
all
the
sharper
because
unexpected
but
his
face
did
not
show
his
mortification
i
trouble
you
to
open
the
door
he
said
as
the
servant
stood
petrified
and
so
once
more
lord
loveland
was
thrown
upon
the
hospitality
of
the
streets
the
flitting
shadows
were
gone
from
the
windows
which
still
gleamed
cheerily
but
they
were
dark
to
the
outcast
heart
i
need
have
bothered
about
how
to
show
my
gratitude
he
reminded
himself
i
do
think
they
exactly
going
to
make
a
point
of
my
marrying
their
girl
after
all
he
was
able
to
smile
at
this
thought
but
it
was
a
very
faint
chill
smile
and
his
amazement
at
the
treatment
he
was
receiving
everywhere
in
place
of
the
flattering
attention
he
had
been
led
to
expect
was
blank
and
blind
as
a
high
stone
wall
without
doors
or
windows
chapter
fourteen
a
proposition
naturally
it
occurred
to
val
that
the
trail
of
cadwallader
hunter
must
have
reached
as
far
as
the
beverly
household
and
almost
he
found
it
in
his
heart
to
respect
a
man
with
executive
ability
to
accomplish
so
swift
so
sweeping
so
secret
a
revenge
the
old
fellow
must
have
had
a
busy
day
loveland
thought
half
amused
on
top
of
hunger
and
discouragement
he
pictured
the
major
running
lithely
about
since
the
snub
at
lunchtime
up
to
the
last
moment
before
dressing
for
dinner
prejudicing
all
the
friends
made
on
board
the
against
the
englishman
to
whom
he
had
proudly
introduced
them
and
besides
one
must
grant
a
certain
cleverness
to
a
brain
able
to
weave
grounds
of
prejudice
against
a
person
nay
a
personage
important
and
unimpeachable
as
loveland
considered
himself
to
be
how
cadwallader
hunter
had
done
it
val
could
not
imagine
but
that
the
mysterious
thing
which
had
been
done
was
the
major
work
he
did
not
doubt
as
for
the
bother
with
the
bank
of
course
that
was
another
matter
a
coincidence
unconnected
with
the
annoyances
which
had
followed
for
cadwallader
hunter
could
not
have
known
anything
about
the
letter
of
credit
or
where
it
was
to
be
presented
and
though
the
spiteful
old
thing
was
apparently
acquainted
with
van
cotter
who
had
been
one
of
the
coolidge
party
he
could
scarcely
have
read
clairvoyantly
all
the
names
on
the
letters
of
introduction
even
if
he
knew
the
people
as
val
asked
himself
forlornly
what
was
left
for
him
to
do
next
this
last
argument
brought
consolation
and
a
welcome
new
idea
at
the
same
time
as
the
major
had
got
hold
of
the
coolidges
the
miltons
and
beverlys
why
not
go
and
throw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
some
of
jim
harborough
friends
loveland
had
conscientiously
distributed
all
the
letters
in
the
afternoon
and
had
put
the
hotel
as
a
new
york
address
on
his
visiting
cards
now
owing
to
unforeseen
circumstances
another
name
for
the
major
vindictiveness
that
address
was
his
no
longer
when
people
called
as
no
doubt
they
would
do
tomorrow
they
were
likely
to
find
that
he
had
vanished
into
space
yes
without
doubt
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
call
tonight
at
one
of
the
houses
where
he
had
alighted
in
the
afternoon
he
would
walk
to
the
nearest
one
but
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
which
was
the
nearest
and
of
which
was
he
certain
that
he
could
remember
the
street
and
number
val
had
not
charged
his
mind
with
the
addresses
on
the
letters
so
sure
had
he
been
that
the
recipients
would
lose
no
time
in
calling
now
he
went
over
the
eight
or
nine
names
in
his
head
and
thought
that
he
had
kept
them
all
straight
but
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
say
which
number
which
street
appertained
to
which
person
this
was
a
dilemma
almost
a
calamity
but
one
address
seemed
to
stand
out
before
his
eyes
a
number
in
fifth
avenue
and
he
thought
it
was
a
anson
who
lived
there
the
house
was
a
handsome
one
at
a
corner
he
had
admired
it
and
as
it
was
not
far
uptown
he
would
not
have
more
than
a
mile
to
travel
he
could
still
make
his
visit
and
tell
his
pitiful
tale
before
ten
he
walked
fast
and
it
was
by
an
effort
that
the
man
of
the
shadows
kept
him
in
sight
for
val
legs
were
long
and
his
were
not
but
he
did
contrive
to
cling
close
enough
to
see
a
tall
figure
slowly
descend
a
flight
of
stone
steps
climbed
with
alert
hopefulness
a
few
moments
earlier
this
time
there
was
a
discouraged
droop
of
the
head
and
shoulders
and
a
dragging
hesitation
in
the
gait
which
seemed
to
show
that
the
wanderer
did
not
know
what
his
next
move
ought
to
be
at
last
the
watcher
decided
that
he
had
waited
long
enough
the
englishman
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
he
was
tired
out
and
sick
at
heart
in
fact
precisely
in
the
mood
which
the
other
had
been
patiently
expecting
loveland
walked
away
from
the
house
where
anson
was
giving
a
dinner
party
and
regretted
that
she
was
unable
to
receive
visitors
jim
harborough
friend
could
it
be
that
cadwallader
hunter
tentacles
had
wormed
themselves
round
this
lady
sympathies
also
or
was
the
dismissal
another
coincidence
like
that
of
the
bank
loveland
did
not
know
but
he
did
know
that
the
sole
possessions
left
him
were
a
great
hunger
which
he
might
not
satisfy
and
a
great
longing
to
have
somewhere
to
lay
his
head
good
evening
said
the
man
who
had
caught
up
with
him
speaking
somewhat
breathlessly
but
in
a
friendly
voice
loveland
turned
with
a
slight
start
and
looked
at
the
other
face
which
at
that
moment
could
be
plainly
seen
by
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
there
was
a
vague
familiarity
in
the
stranger
appearance
but
val
had
come
into
contact
with
so
many
new
people
lately
that
he
could
attach
no
label
to
these
features
i
was
dining
near
you
at
the
explained
the
unknown
oh
exclaimed
loveland
instantly
adjusting
the
label
you
were
with
the
coolidges
i
remember
the
tips
of
his
ears
began
to
tingle
this
fellow
must
have
seen
him
walk
out
of
the
restaurant
where
he
been
denied
his
dinner
probably
knew
that
he
had
been
practically
turned
away
from
the
hotel
because
he
had
the
money
to
pay
his
bill
my
name
milton
the
short
dark
man
introduced
himself
i
been
trying
to
catch
you
up
for
some
time
why
abruptly
asked
loveland
suspicious
of
everybody
and
everything
now
why
oh
well
i
wanted
the
pleasure
of
a
conversation
with
you
you
know
who
i
am
loveland
enquired
yes
i
know
who
you
are
milton
emphasised
each
word
separately
as
if
with
a
tap
of
a
miniature
hammer
there
was
an
intentional
significance
in
his
way
of
speaking
but
the
meaning
was
obscure
to
loveland
val
could
not
guess
what
the
other
object
was
in
following
him
and
in
his
smarting
sensitiveness
was
on
guard
against
some
new
indignity
i
met
milton
and
your
daughter
on
the
he
ventured
by
way
of
keeping
on
neutral
ground
until
he
should
learn
where
to
take
his
stand
and
truth
to
tell
he
had
been
so
miserable
in
his
homesickness
his
sense
of
desertion
and
humiliation
that
any
companionship
was
pitifully
welcome
a
few
hours
ago
he
would
have
quickly
decided
that
he
did
not
like
the
man
face
or
manner
and
would
have
made
no
bones
about
snubbing
him
but
there
was
a
high
barrier
between
then
and
now
and
lord
loveland
almost
clung
to
milton
i
know
you
met
my
wife
and
daughter
on
the
said
the
watcher
that
why
i
was
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
loveland
laughed
you
the
first
person
since
i
left
the
ship
who
has
wanted
to
make
it
he
retorted
and
it
struck
me
this
evening
that
neither
nor
miss
milton
was
keen
on
keeping
it
miss
milton
is
a
child
answered
miss
milton
father
she
say
her
soul
her
own
if
her
mother
says
it
is
and
milton
has
reasons
over
and
above
what
anyone
else
may
have
for
not
wanting
to
know
you
in
front
of
me
over
and
above
what
anyone
else
may
have
val
repeated
lost
in
surprise
at
this
turning
why
should
she
or
anyone
have
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
know
me
that
the
thing
i
should
like
to
find
out
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
explain
the
mystery
if
you
can
what
has
major
cadwallader
hunter
been
doing
to
put
all
new
york
against
me
so
far
as
i
can
see
it
was
the
major
who
set
the
ball
rolling
though
of
course
he
like
people
to
think
he
was
on
to
it
from
the
first
and
it
seems
he
heard
you
give
yourself
away
a
bit
to
a
girl
one
day
on
shipboard
or
says
he
did
but
let
not
discuss
that
now
what
you
are
or
what
you
did
before
you
stepped
on
board
the
nothing
to
me
the
game
you
and
i
are
in
together
as
it
up
to
me
to
show
you
is
this
you
in
a
pretty
bad
scrape
and
you
want
to
get
out
of
it
is
that
true
or
is
it
yes
it
true
enough
admitted
val
but
that
not
the
question
i
excuse
me
it
is
the
question
where
i
concerned
i
do
go
back
on
that
i
do
want
to
know
anything
or
be
in
anything
else
i
can
help
you
out
of
your
fix
that
what
i
here
to
do
thank
you
said
val
drily
but
why
he
half
expected
that
milton
pro
would
be
a
promise
in
advance
to
make
fanny
the
marchioness
of
loveland
well
i
coming
to
that
in
one
minute
and
a
half
first
and
foremost
let
chat
about
what
i
can
do
for
you
then
we
get
to
what
you
can
do
for
me
i
guess
a
thousand
dollars
would
come
handy
to
you
it
especially
if
you
could
see
half
in
hard
cash
tonight
if
i
saw
any
cash
as
you
call
it
lying
in
the
street
and
nobody
claimed
it
i
confess
i
might
find
a
temporary
use
for
the
money
said
loveland
the
trouble
is
my
letter
of
credit
i
know
all
about
that
letter
of
credit
just
as
well
as
if
you
told
me
broke
in
milton
with
a
queer
mingling
of
tolerant
and
roughness
which
puzzled
loveland
so
much
that
he
almost
forgot
to
be
annoyed
tomorrow
it
will
be
all
right
val
went
on
i
would
bet
on
its
being
all
right
tomorrow
said
milton
but
we
can
wait
to
talk
business
till
the
day
after
if
you
like
that
suit
me
just
as
well
for
i
stand
to
make
better
terms
it
for
you
to
say
where
i
can
give
you
my
card
and
you
can
drop
round
at
my
club
i
do
ask
you
to
write
for
by
that
time
it
might
happen
you
have
a
stamp
or
a
sheet
of
paper
handy
you
can
call
day
after
tomorrow
and
we
have
our
talk
then
so
long
as
we
established
communication
there
is
much
danger
of
your
losing
touch
with
me
till
we
fixed
something
up
i
do
like
your
manner
or
your
innuendoes
said
loveland
stiffening
oh
i
do
mean
any
innuendoes
protested
milton
apologetically
let
keep
friends
i
want
to
help
you
you
had
a
little
trouble
with
them
at
the
hotel
did
you
i
was
abominably
insulted
and
i
make
them
regret
it
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
pay
the
bill
right
off
there
five
hundred
dollars
in
my
pocket
that
just
crying
to
be
in
yours
and
five
hundred
more
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
sharply
asked
loveland
you
like
to
know
whether
the
candle
worth
the
game
eh
well
no
shylock
but
see
here
shall
we
come
to
terms
over
a
drink
we
not
far
off
the
best
bar
in
new
york
and
no
thank
you
val
cut
in
decidedly
though
he
was
cold
enough
and
hollow
enough
within
to
be
tempted
by
the
thought
of
warmth
and
refreshment
of
any
sort
tell
me
now
what
possible
motive
you
a
stranger
can
have
in
offering
to
lend
me
two
hundred
pounds
i
said
nothing
about
lending
insinuated
milton
but
if
you
like
to
call
it
a
loan
you
can
you
got
your
traditions
to
keep
up
i
suppose
and
he
laughed
in
high
good
humour
i
have
said
val
coldly
that
all
right
returned
the
other
well
to
get
to
business
then
you
were
on
pretty
friendly
terms
with
milton
on
board
ship
she
was
very
kind
to
me
replied
val
more
sure
than
ever
now
that
the
proposal
to
come
would
be
matrimonial
good
you
heard
i
expect
from
cadwallader
hunter
or
some
other
general
purveyor
of
gossip
that
she
and
i
are
on
the
best
of
terms
that
we
do
get
along
like
a
pair
of
turtle
doves
i
believe
i
did
hear
some
hint
of
that
sort
which
went
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
you
need
consider
my
feelings
my
wife
and
i
hate
each
other
like
poison
she
have
thrown
me
over
long
ago
if
she
did
want
my
money
all
my
money
not
what
she
might
get
in
alimony
if
we
said
the
parting
words
are
spoken
eh
well
that
just
what
i
want
to
say
to
her
we
never
had
any
open
break
but
the
come
that
why
i
sent
her
to
europe
and
sent
for
her
to
come
back
i
played
my
fish
and
now
i
want
to
land
it
a
queer
fish
milton
is
too
bye
the
bye
i
going
to
bring
a
case
against
her
and
i
want
to
use
you
for
a
trump
card
in
it
you
understand
a
hot
wave
of
rage
swept
over
loveland
he
did
understand
and
never
in
his
life
had
he
been
so
angry
he
had
not
known
it
was
in
him
to
be
so
angry
at
a
thing
which
did
not
affect
his
own
selfish
interests
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
himself
at
all
a
new
or
at
least
unknown
self
stirred
faintly
in
the
depths
where
all
his
life
it
had
lain
asleep
because
perhaps
it
had
never
been
called
upon
to
wake
he
was
not
angry
because
such
a
proposal
had
been
made
to
him
lord
loveland
he
had
not
thought
of
that
part
yet
disgust
with
the
man
who
could
make
such
a
proposition
was
the
one
emotion
which
shook
him
you
beast
he
broke
out
in
his
young
clear
voice
the
other
man
looked
up
at
the
flushed
angry
face
in
genuine
surprise
oh
i
suppose
i
have
offered
lordship
enough
he
sneered
with
a
sarcastic
emphasis
on
the
title
well
i
raise
you
but
something
unexpected
happened
before
the
offer
could
be
completed
furious
loveland
slapped
him
across
the
mouth
and
in
dodging
the
insult
milton
slipped
on
a
morsel
of
thin
ice
which
glazed
the
pavement
he
staggered
tried
to
regain
his
balance
lost
it
finally
and
fell
flat
upon
his
back
loveland
felt
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
drenched
with
cold
water
the
man
fall
the
stillness
of
the
limp
form
which
lay
grotesquely
like
a
dummy
made
of
rags
was
a
sight
to
chill
even
righteous
anger
loveland
had
yet
begun
to
think
of
himself
or
the
danger
he
might
be
in
he
thought
of
the
man
who
seemed
to
him
hardly
a
man
and
wondered
if
he
were
dead
then
after
a
dazed
instant
he
bent
down
over
the
motionless
form
and
felt
a
great
throb
of
relief
when
he
saw
no
stain
of
oozing
blood
on
the
pavement
the
fur
lined
collar
of
milton
coat
had
been
pulled
up
behind
his
ears
and
had
broken
the
force
of
the
fall
for
the
back
of
his
head
on
which
otherwise
he
must
have
struck
with
terrible
force
already
his
thick
eyelids
were
twitching
in
another
moment
or
two
he
would
open
them
and
realising
this
val
at
last
turned
to
that
thought
which
generally
came
first
lord
loveland
and
lord
welfare
he
glanced
hastily
round
and
assured
himself
that
no
one
was
near
no
one
could
have
seen
the
incident
which
luckily
for
him
had
happened
at
some
distance
from
a
street
lamp
he
thought
carefully
but
quickly
if
anyone
should
come
if
an
alarm
were
given
if
he
should
find
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
police
that
would
be
the
worst
thing
that
had
happened
yet
this
beast
who
lay
there
this
beast
who
had
taken
advantage
of
a
stranger
misfortunes
to
try
and
bribe
him
to
the
basest
dishonour
was
hurt
half
as
badly
as
he
deserved
to
be
loveland
was
glad
he
had
struck
the
wretch
and
would
do
it
again
if
it
had
to
be
done
again
pay
for
the
satisfaction
dearly
as
he
might
have
to
pay
but
he
did
not
see
that
there
was
need
to
pay
at
all
if
the
fellow
complained
to
the
police
of
his
assault
val
could
defend
himself
by
telling
the
truth
because
milton
name
must
not
be
brought
in
he
did
not
admire
her
particularly
and
he
owed
her
no
gratitude
but
she
was
a
woman
and
suddenly
he
knew
of
himself
that
he
would
bear
the
worst
that
might
befall
him
rather
than
drag
milton
into
a
scandal
for
as
long
as
he
might
have
taken
to
count
twelve
perhaps
lord
loveland
stood
making
up
his
mind
and
staring
at
the
man
on
the
ground
then
he
walked
away
as
quickly
as
he
dared
how
interminable
the
length
of
this
seemed
he
did
not
even
know
what
street
it
was
into
which
he
had
turned
almost
mechanically
with
milton
as
they
talked
nor
did
it
matter
if
only
he
could
get
out
and
far
enough
away
before
milton
came
to
himself
to
gabble
some
malicious
lie
about
what
had
happened
chapter
fifteen
introducing
shakespeare
the
end
of
the
street
and
no
pursuing
steps
nor
shouts
of
accusing
voices
once
round
the
corner
loveland
breathed
more
freely
but
with
the
white
glint
of
his
uncovered
evening
shirt
he
was
a
marked
man
among
men
whose
overcoats
acknowledged
winter
and
his
one
anxiety
for
the
moment
was
to
get
on
as
far
as
possible
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
he
had
two
or
three
small
pieces
of
american
money
in
his
pocket
rather
more
than
equal
to
the
value
of
an
english
shilling
and
he
thought
of
hurling
himself
into
a
tearing
electric
car
or
rushing
up
the
steps
of
an
l
station
to
board
the
first
train
that
should
come
in
but
he
did
not
know
what
destination
to
name
and
feared
that
if
he
professed
indifference
as
to
the
end
of
the
journey
he
might
arouse
suspicion
it
was
wiser
he
decided
to
go
on
foot
dodging
from
the
brilliantly
lighted
avenues
into
the
darker
and
so
on
indefinitely
until
it
seemed
safe
to
call
a
halt
before
the
unexpected
climax
of
his
interview
with
milton
loveland
had
still
hoped
for
ultimate
shelter
and
dinner
but
now
he
ceased
to
regard
either
as
a
likely
goal
of
his
adventure
the
great
thing
was
not
to
be
caught
by
the
new
york
police
and
run
in
for
assault
clapped
into
prison
into
print
and
forever
out
of
the
matrimonial
court
the
present
was
very
bad
but
there
was
hope
for
the
future
although
milton
hints
and
strange
manner
had
brought
closer
the
cloud
of
dark
presentiment
until
it
pressed
like
a
thick
veil
over
eyes
when
he
found
himself
in
the
plaza
and
saw
the
black
forest
of
the
park
billowing
away
into
distance
like
the
gulf
of
night
he
looked
towards
it
as
a
refuge
if
only
it
were
still
open
at
this
hour
if
only
he
could
get
in
his
doubt
died
at
birth
for
a
big
motor
car
whizzed
by
him
and
into
the
velvet
gloom
evidently
central
park
was
not
shut
to
the
public
at
night
loveland
followed
the
car
and
though
moving
ghostlike
along
a
road
he
had
not
quite
the
sense
of
being
blotted
out
by
darkness
it
was
good
to
escape
from
glaring
lights
and
staring
people
when
loveland
became
accustomed
to
the
gloom
it
took
on
colour
to
his
eyes
and
turned
from
black
to
a
deep
transparent
blue
which
shimmered
round
him
like
the
shadows
of
spirit
forms
and
far
away
where
flared
the
lights
of
the
great
white
way
the
dusk
was
beaten
into
sparks
of
flame
as
if
a
dying
torch
had
been
shaken
down
the
sky
the
blazing
eyes
of
motor
lamps
and
moved
along
the
dim
drives
and
drew
the
night
in
after
them
like
a
folding
curtain
val
turned
out
of
a
broad
thoroughfare
of
the
park
into
a
quieter
road
to
avoid
the
procession
of
vehicles
and
the
faces
that
peered
from
their
windows
there
were
no
faces
in
the
world
that
he
wanted
to
see
now
save
his
mother
and
lesley
dearmer
and
he
was
ashamed
of
the
longing
which
ached
in
him
for
those
two
buck
up
you
blighter
he
admonished
himself
do
be
an
ass
or
a
baby
it
was
easy
to
lash
his
soul
with
sage
advice
but
he
felt
very
small
and
pitiful
in
the
vast
unfriendly
city
where
it
seemed
that
there
were
warm
overcoats
and
good
dinners
for
everybody
except
the
marquis
of
loveland
he
strayed
aimlessly
along
a
winding
way
haunted
by
a
melancholy
fragrance
of
dying
leaves
and
a
silence
that
rustled
with
scurrying
thoughts
which
could
never
embody
themselves
in
words
in
the
great
illuminated
cañons
of
the
new
york
streets
electricity
outshone
the
stars
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
the
moon
lived
or
died
but
above
the
park
hung
a
sky
like
a
bell
purple
in
its
dome
and
touched
with
metallic
gleams
at
the
rim
where
the
climbed
and
bye
and
bye
that
purple
paled
slowly
with
the
that
sifted
down
in
silver
dust
over
the
black
trees
whitening
the
autumn
mists
that
clung
close
to
the
grass
like
a
on
the
dead
loveland
was
bitterly
cold
now
cold
all
the
way
through
to
his
heart
but
he
flung
himself
down
on
a
bench
under
a
tree
and
wondered
desolately
if
he
had
found
his
quarters
for
the
night
for
a
moment
he
had
sat
there
trying
to
marshal
the
routed
army
of
his
thoughts
before
he
realised
that
he
was
not
alone
on
the
seat
something
stirred
at
the
far
end
where
the
shadow
was
deepest
there
was
a
faint
tinkle
as
of
a
fairy
bell
a
cracked
fairy
bell
and
a
tiny
shape
leaped
from
the
bench
loveland
watched
it
flitting
here
and
there
darting
across
the
glimmering
grey
road
and
then
about
to
prick
daintily
back
again
when
a
motor
swung
round
the
curving
corner
the
fragile
sound
of
the
bell
was
drowned
and
the
little
shape
would
have
gone
under
the
wheels
to
be
swept
into
nothingness
like
chaff
by
the
wind
had
not
val
sprung
forward
and
dashed
across
the
road
in
front
of
the
car
catching
up
the
morsel
in
his
rush
he
risked
his
life
but
the
lights
of
the
car
had
shown
him
in
one
blinding
flash
that
the
frisking
thing
was
a
miniature
black
dog
no
bigger
than
his
hand
and
val
loved
dogs
big
and
little
with
all
that
was
best
and
warmest
in
him
nothing
could
have
tempted
him
to
hurt
a
dog
or
indeed
any
animal
save
those
it
was
the
legitimate
sport
of
englishmen
to
kill
and
he
could
imagine
himself
murdering
a
man
guilty
of
cruelty
to
any
helpless
creature
the
motor
horn
gave
a
shriek
and
there
was
a
grinding
of
brakes
jammed
on
with
savage
suddenness
but
the
car
could
not
have
stopped
in
time
it
was
only
loveland
quickness
which
saved
him
and
scarcely
beyond
touch
of
the
tyres
he
stumbled
drawing
up
his
knees
to
keep
from
being
run
over
but
he
had
the
tiny
beating
body
in
his
hand
held
up
out
of
harm
way
you
fool
you
have
had
yourself
to
thank
if
you
been
smashed
growled
the
chauffeur
who
was
alone
in
the
car
and
it
god
wonder
you
did
make
me
skid
smack
into
that
bench
loveland
picking
himself
up
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
answer
and
the
chauffeur
who
heard
the
arrival
of
a
policeman
unsympathetic
to
motor
men
decided
not
to
stop
for
further
argument
with
a
parting
grumble
he
slipped
away
into
the
night
and
loveland
by
this
time
on
his
feet
walked
quietly
across
the
road
again
with
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
quivering
in
his
hand
that
was
a
close
shave
for
you
you
little
beggar
he
said
half
aloud
who
are
you
i
wonder
and
where
did
you
spring
from
answers
to
name
o
shakespeare
and
dropped
out
o
my
pocket
while
i
snoozed
i
guess
said
a
voice
from
the
shadow
you
bet
i
obliged
to
you
for
what
you
done
was
fine
under
the
big
tree
that
roofed
the
seat
moon
rays
dripped
between
branches
like
water
that
trickles
slowly
through
holes
in
old
netting
a
man
who
had
been
huddled
asleep
on
one
corner
of
the
bench
was
on
his
feet
holding
out
eager
hands
to
take
the
dog
from
loveland
a
shabby
figure
even
in
the
dim
light
with
a
hatchet
face
thin
as
a
new
moon
that
glimmered
pale
between
the
black
blot
of
a
frowsy
hat
and
the
inky
blur
of
a
coat
collar
val
could
make
out
the
features
but
indistinctly
yet
he
caught
the
impression
of
a
quaint
patient
humourousness
as
if
a
character
sketch
penned
on
white
paper
in
three
or
four
sharp
black
lines
had
been
passed
quickly
before
his
eyes
chapter
sixteen
shakespeare
master
lord
loveland
habit
was
to
give
a
wide
berth
to
common
people
if
chance
the
democrat
threw
him
near
them
with
the
exception
of
tommies
who
for
him
as
a
soldier
were
a
class
by
themselves
a
class
in
which
he
recognised
humanity
that
touched
his
own
he
did
not
love
ugliness
or
shabbiness
which
as
like
as
not
meant
microbes
but
he
had
come
down
so
near
to
the
depths
of
reality
tonight
that
he
had
no
sense
of
his
own
superiority
or
inclination
to
shrink
away
when
the
hands
touched
his
as
they
took
the
rescued
animal
i
came
along
in
the
nick
of
time
said
loveland
and
i
like
dogs
i
thought
i
could
just
do
it
and
i
did
was
fine
all
the
same
repeated
the
dog
master
i
ai
much
of
a
public
speaker
but
i
guess
you
know
how
i
feel
all
right
pretty
near
put
me
out
o
business
if
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
but
the
tenderness
with
which
he
tucked
into
his
pocket
the
wretched
little
apology
for
a
dog
made
further
words
superfluous
loveland
always
polite
to
inferiors
unless
overmastered
by
rage
looked
at
the
bench
as
if
it
were
the
first
comer
property
if
you
do
mind
i
sit
down
he
said
the
shabby
one
laughed
i
ai
paid
for
my
lodgings
said
he
and
if
i
had
you
be
welcome
after
what
you
done
you
can
have
me
for
a
doormat
if
you
like
thanks
said
loveland
laughing
too
i
do
need
a
doormat
if
it
was
an
overcoat
now
you
could
have
mine
if
you
were
twice
the
size
for
it
and
if
anthony
comstock
would
run
me
in
if
he
saw
what
i
got
on
underneath
but
i
guess
you
would
have
to
wish
twice
for
a
coat
if
in
your
part
my
part
repeated
val
if
the
piece
you
in
called
for
it
i
do
understand
they
were
both
sitting
down
now
filling
the
far
corners
of
the
bench
and
talking
across
it
well
my
show
i
do
want
to
be
fresh
but
though
i
seen
a
lot
o
plants
growin
in
this
flower
garden
i
do
just
recall
seein
one
like
you
take
root
you
would
now
if
i
had
anywhere
else
to
go
returned
loveland
with
his
usual
frankness
gee
you
take
me
for
the
fall
guy
but
say
do
you
want
anything
out
me
if
you
do
you
can
have
it
if
you
a
journalist
out
on
a
night
stunt
and
what
you
fishin
for
is
the
history
o
my
life
on
for
shakespeare
sake
any
form
you
like
sad
or
gay
moral
lesson
or
otherwise
hang
journalists
think
so
well
millionaire
then
seein
how
the
poor
live
you
look
the
swell
all
right
thank
you
wish
i
felt
as
i
look
then
you
make
the
gould
and
vanderbilt
crowd
look
like
visitors
if
you
had
forgot
your
overcoat
i
left
it
at
the
hotel
sa
ay
if
that
ai
like
me
drawled
the
man
the
twinkle
of
moonlight
striking
a
humourous
glint
in
his
eye
kind
of
i
left
my
sunday
suit
just
that
way
at
the
white
house
last
week
where
i

me
out
of
the
hotel
gee
but
you
there
yes
if
that
ai
the
swell
thing
i
would
mind

if
once
they
let
me
in
i
should
say
to
myself
sir

that
what
i
never
have
done
but
what
i
always
meanin
to
do
when
my
time
comes

it
be
offensive
if
i
asked
why
they

could
pay
for
my
dinner

val
beginning
to
be
a
little
warmer
because
he
was
amused
bet
it
was
bully
i
was
hungry
then
pity
still
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
murmured
reflectively
you
got
it
to
remember
and
i
guess
a
lot
of
other
nice
things
if
that
were
any
comfort
be
to
me
say
i
do
throw
myself
out
much
to
strangers
but

it
to
new
york
sixty
mile
chuck
full
of
hope
and
nothin
else
unless
beans
a
regular
mark
tapley
said
val
never
played
the
part
in
private
life
my
name
bill
willing
some
switches
it
round
to
willing
bill
because
i
generally
do
my
day
work
without
howlin
i
blew
into
new
york
without
attractin
much
notice
and
that
nineteen
years
ago
and
i
have
attracted
much
since
that
a
fact
but
you
may
do
better
do
be
discouraged
by
a
setback
if
your
game
square
and
i
bet
it
is
or
you
would
be
in
the
dog
savin
business
what
your
lay
anyhow
excuse
the
liberty
retrieving
my
fortune
said
val
after
a
moment
reflection
you
can
see
me
one
better
mine
to
make
yet
and
i
no
kid
like
you
i
wo
see
again
i
an
artist
but
new
york
woke
up
to
my
talent
maybe
i
been
too
versatile
that
never
did
pay
the
line
i
mapped
out
was
paintin
pictures
but
my
chance
was
slow
comin
had
to
take
what
i
could
get
on
the
way
along
supin
sandwichin
barkin
eh
what
broke
in
loveland
you
do
savvy
oh
supin
in
theatres
there
several
specially
one
in
the
bowery
would
been
complete
without
me
for
years
till
i
got
the
chuck
like
you
did
at
the
waldorf
sandwichin
why
you
know
what
that
is
sure
you
would
think
how
you
get
the
cramps
shut
up
between
the
boards
the
sandwichin
was
generally
in
the
theatrical
line
too
so
i
always
kind
of
hovered
around
the
profession
though
i
do
say
i
proud
of
my
career
as
a
barker
in
the
dimes
museums
you
know
there
was
money
in
the
business
though
if
the
freaks
caught
on
that
i
had
the
heart
of
a
soft
boiled
egg
always
ready
to
part
if
they
worked
the
aged
mother
dodge
or
the
baby
brother
who
threw
fits
i
ai
no
savings
bank
wish
i
was
i
should
be
better
off
now
besides
my
voice
ai
an
automobile
horn
and
for
a
couple
of
seasons
stove
a
hole
in
my
top
note
after
that
no
manager
would
take
me
with
a
pound
of
tea
and
a
chromo
but
one
of
my
old
govs
switched
me
onto
a
job
paintin
freak
showboards
and
i
been
at
it
yet
if
freaks
did
last
too
long
once
you
put
them
on
the
boards
there
they
at
present
my
speciality
meenoos
val
looked
blank
thinking
of
emus
french
for
grub
cards
a
swell
like
you
ought
to
be
on
to
that
but
just
thinkin
what
there
is
for
you
this
stunt
of
mine
i
dropped
into
by
luck
was
shakespeare
introduced
me
like
he
did
to
you
tonight
why
shakespeare
loveland
cut
in
oh
there
a
a
girl
in
that
story
actress
in
the
theatre
where
i
suped
a
real
actress
mind
you
a
fascinator
from
fascinatorville
why
lil
so
much
as
looked
at
me
i
do
know
but
she
did
i
was
near
twice
her
age
and
have
been
playin
the
game
too
low
down
to
try
and
hook
onto
her
though
i
was
tempted
she
was
so
pretty
so
good
to
me
i
do
know
what
would
been
the
upshot
if
the
property
man
who
had
his
eye
on
the
gal
had
got
me
the
sack
and
lil
an
engagement
on
the
road
she
and
i
drifted
apart
i
never
wrote
though
she
asked
me
to
i
knew
was
better
not
for
her
but
you
see
why
i
nuts
on
the
dog
he
was
hers
and
shakespeare
was
her
name
for
him
she
loved
plays
and
her
ambition
was
to
act
in
but
all
that
somethin
i
would
mentioned
if
you
had
kind
of
earned
the
right
to
history
i
was
tellin
you
about
my
speciality
and
how
shake
introduced
me
to
it
we
was
on
our
beam
ends
shake
and
me
our
ribs
through
the
silk
one
mornin
after
a
night
out
like
this
only
in
a
square
downtown
i
was
circulatin
around
till
i
blew
into
twelfth
street
and
dropped
my
eyes
onto
a
new
restaurant
with
a
good
fried
smell
and
an
idea
hit
my
brain
like
a
hammer
in
i
walks
and
offers
to
swop
it
with
the
boss
for
a
dinner
he
was
takin
any
just
then
but
i
talked
till
i
waked
him
up
showed
him
what
i
could
do
in
the
art
line
and
began
to
work
on
the
spot
with
a
grand
new
thing
in
meenoos
i
been
at
it
ever
since
and
though
the
pay
do
go
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
house
has
and
lots
o
the
eaters
say
it
my
work
made
it
what
it
is
brought
in
the
public
like
a
flock
of
sheep
i
get
two
meals
and
three
dimes
a
day
out
of
the
job
and
i
would
be
sleepin
in
my
country
house
tonight
if
i
had
run
acrost
a
guy
who
needed
my
money
more
than
i
did
well
it
all
in
the
day
work
and
i
guess
there
ai
many
swells
have
got
a
finer
palace
than
this
though
it
kind
of
draughty
your
castle
across
the
pond
ai
got
a
finer
park
i
bet
my
castle
full
of
draughts
too
loveland
humoured
him
so
you
came
over
here
to
get
out
of
exactly
and
that
fortune
you
want
to
retrace
or
wisht
i
could
help
i
expecting
a
cablegram
in
the
morning
that
will
put
me
all
right
thank
you
said
loveland
you
a
good
chap
and
i
glad
to
have
met
you
for
you
er
broadened
my
outlook
as
well
as
passed
the
time
i
only
to
worry
through
till
tomorrow
that
some
hours
off
said
bill
willing
wisht
i
could
invite
you
to
my
hotel
where
i
hang
out
when
i
not
at
my
country
place
but
the
trouble
is
to
see
the
colour
of
your
money
or
you
do
see
the
colour
of
their
beds
how
much
is
it
for
a
room
asked
loveland
oh
a
room
i
do
run
to
a
room
a
bed
in
a
vast
wilderness
is
good
enough
for
me
but
a
quarter
get
you
one
three
nickels
for
a
bed
loveland
searched
his
pockets
and
dubiously
exhibited
two
silver
coins
mixed
democratically
with
a
few
nickels
and
impotent
looking
little
coppers
the
prospect
appeared
hopeless
to
him
but
willing
exclaimed
with
delight
gee
cents
you
a
bloated
millionaire
you
might
be
asleep
in
two
beds
at
the
bat
hotel
instead
of
cooling
in
this
freezer
if
there
the
price
of
two
beds
you
must
have
one
said
loveland
thank
you
you
the
real
stuff
returned
bill
gratitude
in
his
voice
but
i
where
i
am
you
stick
to
your
stamps
i
know
just
how
you
feel
i
always
chuckin
my
last
cent
away
on
some
poor
dickybird
thinkin
be
all
right
tomorrow
and
what
the
odds
there
are
no
odds
against
me
this
time
val
assured
him
cheered
me
up
no
end
and
you
must
share
what
i
have
but
about
the
hotel
it
clean
all
right
may
be
the
plaza
or
the
waldorf
but
no
dive
it
warm
and
the
rooms
are
real
natty
what
about
food
asked
loveland
can
we
run
to
it
and
he
glanced
at
the
coins
in
his
hand
keep
the
change
we
eat
for
nothing
now
our
time
to
join
the
bread
line
again
val
looked
blank
and
again
it
was
necessary
for
bill
willing
guide
philosopher
and
friend
to
explain
there
were
said
he
two
very
important
lines
drawn
every
night
in
new
york
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
the
bread
line
and
the
bed
line
each
was
drawn
in
a
public
square
the
former
in
herald
the
latter
in
madison
and
both
were
traced
by
the
finger
of
charity
the
bed
line
bill
did
not
often
patronize
because
he
could
generally
pay
for
his
own
sleeping
accommodation
and
if
he
could
there
were
always
the
parks
besides
the
parson
chap
who
spoke
in
madison
square
every
night
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
could
collect
only
money
enough
to
supply
a
limited
number
of
men
with
beds
there
was
such
a
long
line
waiting
always
and
the
unlucky
ones
went
away
into
the
night
looking
so
disappointed
bill
could
bear
that
or
the
thought
that
one
more
must
go
bedless
because
he
had
got
in
ahead
as
for
the
bread
line
that
was
different
there
was
usually
enough
to
feed
the
whole
line
with
coffee
thrown
in
it
was
a
good
show
too
and
sometimes
when
bill
had
separated
himself
from
his
last
coin
and
wanted
a
little
cheerful
company
he
linked
onto
the
bread
line
tonight
they
would
both
go
unless
added
mr
willing
you
afraid
some
o
your
swell
friends
may
spot
you
even
if
loveland
had
been
afraid
he
would
have
denied
the
imputation
you
the
only
friend
swell
or
otherwise
that
i
have
in
new
york
said
he
chapter
seventeen
the
lights
of
new
york
it
seemed
to
lord
loveland
that
he
had
never
known
how
dazzling
light
could
be
till
the
of
new
york
flung
their
diamonds
into
his
eyes
though
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
he
emerged
from
behind
the
purple
of
the
sleeping
park
there
was
no
sign
that
less
secluded
quarters
of
the
city
thought
of
sleep
the
amazing
jewels
of
the
city
still
scintillated
against
the
sky
flashing
coloured
fire
the
great
white
way
still
blazed
with
brightness
brighter
than
day
the
huge
windows
of
shops
closed
to
customers
advertised
attractions
for
tomorrow
electric
cars
were
still
crowded
going
up
and
down
overhead
was
a
ceaseless
rush
and
roar
of
elevated
trains
and
herald
square
which
the
comrades
reached
by
short
cuts
and
devious
ways
known
to
the
initiated
seemed
the
beating
heart
of
the
big
vital
body
whose
head
was
in
the
sky
in
the
palace
of
the
herald
tomorrow
morning
paper
was
visibly
going
to
press
there
was
a
chewing
rumble
of
huge
printing
machines
and
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
of
the
bronze
owls
staring
electric
eyes
sprang
covered
wagons
loaded
with
editions
which
must
catch
early
trains
newsboys
were
yelling
extras
trying
to
howl
each
other
down
above
the
confused
storm
of
sound
and
as
willing
bill
towed
his
convoy
into
the
square
minerva
lifted
her
noble
bronze
arm
to
give
the
midnight
signal
her
pair
of
obedient
blacksmiths
swung
their
hammers
lustily
and
struck
the
bell
twelve
times
val
and
his
companion
were
nearly
the
last
in
a
long
procession
of
applicants
for
newspaper
hospitality
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
lord
loveland
found
himself
among
the
dregs
of
humanity
learning
what
it
might
be
to
suffer
as
they
suffered
they
who
seethed
in
the
cauldron
of
the
world
misery
he
had
known
that
this
sort
of
thing
existed
that
there
were
men
and
women
who
went
hungry
and
thirsty
who
slept
out
of
doors
and
who
had
no
place
on
earth
surface
which
even
for
a
night
they
might
call
their
own
but
he
had
been
wont
to
skip
paragraphs
about
them
in
the
papers
and
had
always
avoided
brushing
against
a
shabby
person
in
a
crowded
street
he
had
never
felt
any
tie
of
blood
between
himself
and
common
men
except
the
tommy
atkins
who
fought
and
died
round
him
in
south
africa
yet
these
weary
ones
on
whom
the
light
of
herald
square
blazed
down
these
men
of
hopeless
concave
faces
beaten
in
by
sin
or
sorrow
pressed
near
to
loveland
soul
and
waked
some
feeling
in
it
which
he
had
never
known
it
was
as
if
his
friend
of
the
park
had
initiated
him
into
some
strange
secret
society
in
joining
which
the
bare
fact
of
membership
gave
at
once
a
mysterious
sense
of
brotherhood
val
was
surprised
that
he
felt
no
repulsion
against
the
ragged
wretches
who
crowded
round
him
he
did
not
draw
himself
away
from
them
or
resent
their
lack
of
respect
for
him
as
a
superior
being
he
was
sorry
for
them
all
with
a
consciousness
of
kinship
which
he
thought
he
would
probably
remember
with
amusement
tomorrow
they
think
you
some
fly
reporter
takin
notes
or
a
swell
doin
the
night
sights
said
bill
they
do
like
you
much
but
they
bother
you
neither
only
some
chap
may
say
queer
things
you
see
when
you
have
got
your
gun
if
he
does
do
you
take
notice
that
all
loveland
promised
forbearance
but
his
patience
was
not
tried
in
his
turn
which
came
when
his
nose
had
turned
a
pale
lilac
with
cold
and
the
insteps
above
his
pumps
were
slowly
congealing
he
received
a
tin
of
hot
coffee
and
a
roll
food
and
drink
were
so
good
and
as
bill
said
filled
such
a
want
that
val
bolted
them
greedily
only
to
yearn
for
more
when
both
were
gone
but
etiquette
was
strictly
preserved
in
herald
square
no
one
asked
for
a
second
helping
and
each
applicant
when
he
had
drained
his
coffee
to
the
last
drop
walked
away
without
a
word
unless
it
were
a
thank
you
now
ho
for
the
bat
hotel
exclaimed
bill
cheerfully
it
a
goodish
step
but
as
for
me
after
that
grub
i
feel
like
i
could
do
a
sprint
round
the
world
loveland
was
refreshed
too
and
more
than
ever
inclined
to
look
on
the
experience
as
an
adventure
over
which
he
would
laugh
tomorrow
night
but
he
did
not
intend
to
forget
bill
willing
when
he
forgot
the
troubles
through
which
bill
was
his
pilot
he
must
do
something
for
the
poor
chap
he
said
to
himself
and
glowed
with
hot
coffee
and
a
sense
of
warm
generosity
bill
hotel
it
appeared
was
situated
in
the
bowery
there
were
others
more
or
less
of
the
same
sort
dotted
about
in
various
streets
of
far
eastern
and
far
western
new
york
but
bill
would
not
guarantee
these
i
ai
a
top
wave
swell
myself
yet
he
said
but
dirt
and
i
friends
and
i
wo
risk
no
menagerie
for
neither
of
us
nor
shakespeare
either
i
raised
him
to
be
particular
he
that
when
he
made
a
public
thoroughfare
of
by
one
or
two
o
them
critters
as
boarded
the
ark
in
disguise
that
he
wo
look
me
in
the
face
shakespeare
who
had
shared
his
master
roll
and
lapped
the
last
spoonful
of
coffee
was
an
incredibly
small
black
animal
of
somewhat
texture
who
in
form
rather
resembled
a
grasshopper
he
had
a
little
sharp
nose
which
might
have
been
whittled
into
shape
with
a
penknife
his
legs
were
too
long
for
his
tiny
body
and
not
much
thicker
than
a
pencil
but
his
gentle
eyes
curiously
like
his
master
beamed
with
affection
and
he
was
turning
grey
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
owing
to
the
lava
heat
of
his
boiling
emotions
loveland
had
visions
of
buying
shakespeare
a
red
collar
when
he
had
cashed
his
letter
of
credit
tomorrow
but
with
a
sudden
pang
he
remembered
a
difficulty
concerning
that
letter
of
credit
which
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
he
had
wired
to
the
bank
in
london
in
the
afternoon
and
given
as
his
address
the
after
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
treated
and
the
manner
of
his
exit
it
would
be
beneath
his
dignity
to
go
back
on
any
errand
whatever
he
must
send
to
the
hotel
for
the
cablegram
which
it
seemed
certain
would
arrive
during
the
morning
also
for
the
visiting
cards
which
some
of
jim
and
betty
harborough
friends
were
sure
to
leave
after
calling
and
finding
him
gone
perhaps
some
of
these
cards
would
make
the
hotel
people
regret
the
error
of
their
ways
but
apologies
would
be
in
vain
he
would
go
to
the
plaza
or
the
belmont
we
approach
the
castle
doors
me
lord
grandiloquently
announced
bill
little
guessing
that
his
jesting
way
of
address
was
that
to
which
loveland
was
accustomed
from
his
inferiors
val
started
from
the
reverie
in
which
he
had
been
walking
at
his
companion
side
like
a
mechanical
figure
he
waked
to
find
himself
in
a
brilliantly
illuminated
street
like
a
imitation
of
broadway
lined
with
lighted
shops
gaudy
restaurants
and
strange
houses
of
entertainment
this
is
the
bowery
bill
mentioned
with
pride
the
bowery
english
loveland
had
vaguely
expected
a
gentle
suburb
of
trees
and
flowers
such
as
american
bill
might
have
pictured
bloomsbury
and
as
willing
knew
naught
of
the
pleasant
bouweries
of
old
dutch
days
he
had
no
explanation
to
mitigate
his
companion
disillusionment
they
passed
a
tall
building
whose
red
front
was
pictorial
with
advertisements
of
wonders
such
as
the
world
could
not
have
survived
had
it
seen
them
in
the
flesh
my
old
pitch
said
bill
i
painted
the
fat
twins
with
their
heads
under
their
arms
and
the
the
fair
one
with
golden
locks
too
and
the
human
bone
are
my
shay
doovers
what
do
you
think
of
chum
chum
was
filled
with
respectful
admiration
of
the
imagination
if
not
of
his
and
he
replied
fervently
that
the
shay
doovers
in
question
were
marvellous
here
where
i
used
to
bark
went
on
bill
with
a
sigh
for
past
glories
they
ought
to
give
us
free
passes
for
a
look
round
if
like
but
the
boss
ai
built
that
way
and
there
nothing
to
see
anyhow
the
freaks
what
they
painted
be
for
a
dime
loveland
answered
that
no
doubt
the
pictures
were
the
best
part
of
the
show
which
pleased
the
artist
and
they
walked
on
bill
blasé
val
interested
to
the
point
of
a
few
doors
to
the
left
after
passing
a
shooting
gallery
and
a
drinking
saloon
which
called
itself
a
café
mr
willing
paused
in
front
of
a
tall
building
which
loomed
up
dingy
and
in
comparison
with
its
gaudy
neighbors
a
lamp
over
a
door
drew
sufficient
attention
to
the
announcement
printed
in
faded
lettering
that
this
was
the
bat
hotel
for
gentlemen
only
bill
willing
opened
the
door
as
if
he
were
at
home
as
indeed
he
was
for
the
bat
had
been
his
headquarters
more
or
less
for
years
he
sometimes
paid
in
advance
for
a
week
or
weeks
at
a
time
and
then
the
same
bed
and
locker
were
scrupulously
reserved
for
him
but
he
had
been
a
little
irregular
lately
owing
to
his
many
promiscuous
charities
come
in
do
he
said
hospitably
and
loveland
obeyed
to
find
himself
standing
directly
at
the
foot
of
a
long
dimly
lit
stairway
the
steps
of
which
were
protected
from
the
wear
and
tear
of
time
and
boots
by
strips
of
iron
at
the
top
was
a
closed
door
and
this
open
loveland
was
plunged
into
the
life
and
movement
of
the
bat
hotel
appropriately
named
for
its
night
activities
behind
a
grating
which
formed
a
small
room
stood
the
proprietor
or
manager
of
the
establishment
ready
to
accept
payment
allot
beds
inscribe
the
names
of
new
clients
in
a
book
and
deal
out
keys
of
lockers
or
cubicles
this
tiny
office
was
cut
out
of
a
long
narrow
room
in
which
fifty
or
sixty
men
were
sitting
glancing
over
the
newspapers
or
writing
a
last
letter
before
they
went
to
bed
they
were
grouped
at
one
of
several
long
tables
that
ran
down
the
length
of
the
room
or
assembled
round
a
huge
iron
stove
whose
fat
body
was
almost
red
hot
the
crude
white
light
of
unshaded
electric
lamps
exaggerated
the
hollows
in
tired
faces
and
brought
out
a
kind
of
tragic
family
likeness
among
them
different
as
were
the
types
and
features
the
likeness
born
of
the
same
kind
of
hardships
endured
without
hope
of
anything
better
in
the
world
there
were
two
windows
at
front
and
back
of
the
long
room
but
they
were
closed
save
perhaps
for
a
furtive
crack
at
the
top
and
the
heated
atmosphere
was
charged
with
the
smell
of
cheap
tobacco
for
the
men
were
allowed
to
smoke
though
not
to
drink
in
the
bat
hotel
badly
aired
clothing
and
hot
humanity
as
bill
easily
leaned
his
elbows
on
a
narrow
shelf
in
front
of
the
office
grating
explaining
his
errand
to
the
manager
loveland
wished
himself
back
in
the
park
again
half
drowned
in
perfumed
moony
vapour
but
it
was
too
late
he
was
in
for
it
now
he
said
to
himself
as
bill
with
a
certain
pride
announced
that
his
friend
wanted
a
room
a
bed
for
mine
he
went
on
pleasantly
i
be
glad
of
if
it
free
i
always
sleep
mighty
well
in
was
engaged
but
bill
got
another
number
to
which
he
was
accustomed
and
then
his
friend
name
was
asked
anything
you
like
up
to
edward
seventh
or
down
to
smith
whispered
mr
willing
as
he
moved
away
that
loveland
might
take
his
place
at
the
grating
loveland
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
gave
the
name
of
gordon
one
to
which
he
had
a
right
among
many
others
as
bill
was
competent
to
play
host
they
were
given
their
keys
and
allowed
to
find
their
own
way
to
their
quarters
loveland
number
was
on
the
next
floor
but
bill
cheaper
lodging
was
higher
up
at
the
top
of
another
flight
of
stairs
was
a
row
of
cubicles
boarded
in
up
to
the
ceiling
and
protected
above
by
thick
wire
netting
lest
some
nimble
moved
by
curiosity
or
a
less
fanciful
motive
should
be
minded
to
enter
his
neighbour
dwelling
in
spite
of
lock
and
key
the
cubicles
were
not
numerous
for
such
accommodation
was
beyond
the
means
beyond
even
the
ambition
of
a
hundred
out
of
the
hundred
and
sixty
men
whom
the
bat
hotel
sheltered
each
night
the
row
called
fifth
avenue
by
those
who
could
not
afford
to
sleep
there
was
partitioned
off
from
a
long
room
the
size
of
the
below
but
here
instead
of
tables
and
benches
running
along
the
walls
were
beds
many
beds
placed
at
small
irregular
distances
from
each
other
a
faint
light
revealed
them
and
the
straight
dark
shapes
of
the
lockers
shared
half
and
half
by
the
sleepers
whom
loveland
could
dimly
see
hunched
up
under
their
grey
blankets
some
men
slept
in
their
clothes
for
warmth
though
the
room
was
not
cold
here
and
there
a
hat
or
cap
made
a
black
blot
on
a
thin
flattened
pillow
and
the
collar
of
an
overcoat
appeared
above
a
blanket
at
the
back
dark
led
to
the
washroom
and
a
few
wearily
drooping
figures
flitted
to
and
fro
silently
as
the
bat
which
lent
its
name
to
their
lodging
save
for
their
dragging
footsteps
which
scarcely
sounded
on
the
cement
floor
damp
with
disinfectant
there
was
no
sound
in
the
big
dormitory
unless
an
occasional
snore
or
a
word
blurted
out
in
sleep
bill
unlocked
the
door
of
loveland
cubicle
for
him
this
is
pretty
complete
ai
it
he
asked
in
a
whisper
which
respected
the
slumber
of
others
the
beds
are
good
enough
for
mine
but
these
rooms
are
fit
for
a
lord
it
was
a
much
humbled
lord
who
shut
himself
up
in
the
boasted
magnificence
of
no
there
finding
himself
possessed
of
a
narrow
hospital
bed
spread
with
a
grey
blanket
strongly
scented
with
carbolic
and
just
space
enough
in
the
case
to
undress
if
he
chose
but
for
reasons
which
seemed
good
to
him
he
did
not
choose
having
bidden
bill
without
saying
a
word
in
disparagement
of
the
bat
hotel
moved
by
a
new
unselfishness
which
would
not
for
the
world
have
hurt
his
friend
feelings
loveland
took
off
collar
necktie
and
shoes
to
roll
himself
up
in
the
disinfected
blanket
the
bed
was
not
more
than
three
or
four
inches
too
short
for
his
tall
body
and
though
the
mattress
and
pillow
were
as
flat
as
stale
jokes
and
hard
as
poverty
val
fell
asleep
sleeping
dreams
came
to
him
more
real
in
seeming
than
any
happenings
of
the
strange
nightmare
day
just
passed
they
were
of
storms
at
sea
of
fighting
in
south
africa
and
when
a
light
persistent
tapping
at
the
thin
door
wrenched
him
awake
he
thought
he
was
being
called
for
a
night
yes
all
right
he
muttered
sitting
up
dazedly
i
what
sh
you
rouse
everybody
whispered
bill
willing
warning
voice
unlock
the
door
will
you
still
half
asleep
loveland
blinked
in
the
dim
light
found
the
key
in
the
lock
and
turned
it
like
a
shabby
ghost
bill
stole
into
the
cubicle
mighty
sorry
to
rout
you
out
so
early
he
said
in
cautiously
lowered
tones
but
it
six
and
in
half
an
hour
i
got
to
be
at
the
restaurant
to
begin
work
if
you
get
ready
and
come
along
the
boss
daughter
miss
izzie
may
take
a
shine
to
you
and
smuggle
you
a
breakfast
when
alexander
the
great
her
pa
ai
there
to
say
no
by
the
time
that
bill
had
made
his
plans
clear
loveland
drugged
memory
had
begun
to
work
he
recalled
everything
with
the
sensation
of
having
opened
a
gate
to
set
free
a
troop
of
grunting
wild
pigs
he
was
cold
the
carbolic
smell
which
he
hated
made
him
feel
sick
his
head
throbbed
as
if
tacks
were
being
stuck
into
his
temples
and
torn
out
again
his
muscles
were
stiff
and
he
felt
more
tired
than
when
he
had
lain
down
it
was
disgusting
to
think
that
he
had
slept
in
his
clothes
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
had
nothing
fresh
to
put
on
and
he
loathed
his
own
body
because
of
the
squalor
in
which
it
had
consented
to
wallow
how
he
longed
for
a
cold
bath
in
a
great
white
porcelain
tub
clean
linen
neat
tweeds
and
the
luxurious
silver
toilet
things
all
of
which
would
have
been
his
morning
portion
at
home
or
at
the
but
repinings
only
added
to
the
hatefulness
of
his
situation
he
saw
that
and
shook
them
off
yet
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
vent
his
irritation
on
bill
and
yesterday
he
would
have
yielded
as
soon
as
tempted
but
something
had
changed
in
him
since
yesterday
something
stirred
that
through
all
his
life
had
been
asleep
he
made
himself
as
neat
as
he
could
did
not
grumble
at
the
washing
accommodation
and
moved
with
caution
for
fear
of
disturbing
men
whom
hours
ago
he
would
have
considered
no
more
than
sheep
that
was
because
he
had
been
of
the
brotherhood
and
though
he
expected
soon
to
give
up
his
membership
he
would
never
be
able
to
forget
men
such
as
these
with
whom
he
had
touched
shoulders
would
never
be
things
for
him
again
it
was
still
night
in
the
bat
hotel
as
loveland
and
bill
slipped
their
keys
into
the
and
downstairs
but
outside
though
the
lights
of
new
york
had
been
put
out
the
light
of
the
world
climbing
up
the
far
horizon
had
begun
to
gild
the
city
domes
chapter
eighteen
izzie
of
the
almond
eyes
it
was
not
often
that
loveland
came
into
personal
relations
with
sunrise
and
to
see
the
rose
and
golden
banners
float
high
and
higher
above
the
roofs
and
sleeping
windows
of
new
york
was
like
being
first
gazer
at
some
great
painting
in
a
private
view
there
was
hope
and
promise
of
joy
in
such
beauty
but
he
felt
wretchedly
out
of
the
picture
in
his
rumpled
evening
clothes
the
virginal
purity
of
dawn
translucent
above
the
turgid
darkness
of
the
town
made
lesley
dearmer
seem
suddenly
to
be
very
near
him
so
that
the
air
shone
with
her
invisible
presence
how
sweet
she
was
how
delicately
quaint
in
all
her
thoughts
how
kind
to
others
despite
her
clear
wit
and
how
sure
of
ultimate
goodness
as
she
was
of
life
lesley
had
said
that
she
had
faith
in
his
other
side
as
she
had
faith
in
the
other
side
of
the
moon
though
she
did
not
expect
ever
to
see
either
you
will
always
go
on
getting
what
you
want
she
had
prophesied
just
before
they
parted
what
would
she
think
of
that
prophecy
if
she
were
even
to
dream
of
this
humiliated
figure
creeping
out
of
night
to
a
new
day
bill
hatchet
face
glimmered
sallow
and
shabby
through
the
pearly
twilight
and
there
was
a
frayed
look
under
the
patient
humourous
eyes
are
you
cold
he
asked
a
little
replied
val
but
i
do
mind
you
ai
used
to
the
climate
yet
said
bill
and
i
make
you
squeeze
into
my
overcoat
only
i
a
bit
too
sketchy
underneath
afford
to
get
me
winter
wardrobe
back
from
my
uncle
yet
they
passed
out
of
the
bowery
and
turned
into
twelfth
street
most
of
the
houses
still
had
their
eyelids
shut
in
sleep
and
their
brick
faces
looked
dull
lacking
all
interest
in
life
as
if
it
were
hardly
worth
while
to
wake
up
for
another
day
patterned
upon
a
dreary
yesterday
but
in
the
middle
of
the
first
block
there
was
one
house
which
showed
some
faint
signs
of
life
originally
it
had
resembled
its
neighbours
in
all
essential
features
but
the
front
on
the
ground
floor
had
been
altered
a
large
window
of
plate
glass
having
been
put
in
and
from
this
window
a
sleepy
sulky
youth
was
in
the
act
of
removing
a
few
gouts
of
mud
splashed
up
by
some
passing
cart
above
the
wide
window
in
all
the
glory
of
red
and
gold
paint
not
yet
faded
was
the
legend
this
is
alexander
the
great
inside
its
face
turned
towards
the
glass
was
a
big
framed
blackboard
covered
with
pictorial
advertisements
of
various
dishes
done
in
chalks
of
violent
hues
while
from
a
gilded
strip
of
cornice
depended
large
squares
of
cardboard
glorifying
alexander
the
great
and
his
system
in
lettering
of
black
and
scarlet
yesterday
show
explained
bill
my
work
the
whole
lot
the
cards
last
out
the
week
but
the
meenoo
on
the
blackboard
new
every
day
i
tell
you
it
takes
brain
work
hurry
up
chum
i
late
the
sleepy
youth
left
the
door
open
and
they
went
in
passing
directly
into
a
room
fitted
up
as
a
restaurant
the
walls
were
painted
with
lurid
representations
of
alexander
the
great
battles
the
costumes
and
scenery
having
been
studied
more
with
a
view
to
sensational
effect
than
accuracy
of
historical
detail
there
was
a
wild
melée
of
warriors
mixed
with
palm
trees
against
backgrounds
of
sky
and
cobalt
sea
and
the
face
of
alexander
always
a
prominent
figure
in
each
scene
was
evidently
a
portrait
done
from
a
hebraic
model
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
bill
who
was
hastily
unbuttoning
his
overcoat
to
reveal
a
collar
of
immaculate
celluloid
and
a
jacket
or
blazer
of
blue
and
yellow
stripes
it
very
striking
replied
val
my
idea
said
bill
proudly
got
it
from
the
name
over
the
door
as
i
passed
by
that
first
day
came
to
me
like
a
shot
and
then
i
thought
of
the
picture
meenoos
when
they
goin
to
have
rabbit
give
a
rabbit
nibblin
a
bit
of
lettuce
make
it
realistic
when
they
to
hev
punkin
pie
just
make
their
mouths
water
only
to
see
its
portrait
in
the
window
so
they
to
walk
in
and
eat
a
chunk
of
the
old
original
if
it
takes
their
bottom
nickel
now
while
i
work
like
heat
lightnin
you
amuse
yerself
examinin
my
shay
doovers
as
he
spoke
he
darted
to
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
room
in
front
of
which
hung
a
red
curtain
behind
this
curtain
he
disappeared
with
his
cherished
overcoat
returning
in
a
moment
without
the
coat
and
with
the
materials
for
his
work
in
a
wooden
box
originally
intended
for
starch
whistling
melodiously
i
dreamt
that
i
dwelt
in
marble
halls
he
mounted
the
low
platform
in
the
window
which
supported
the
blackboard
and
began
to
mop
out
yesterday
brilliant
triumphs
with
a
wet
sponge
a
list
of
the
principal
dishes
for
the
day
had
been
jotted
down
for
him
in
pencil
on
a
bit
of
paper
which
he
pinned
to
the
frame
of
the
blackboard
lest
memory
prove
treacherous
in
some
succulent
detail
and
then
with
true
artistic
abandonment
he
forgot
everything
except
his
work
meanwhile
loveland
sought
the
neighbourhood
of
a
huge
stove
which
its
flaming
mouth
muzzled
with
talc
looked
like
a
black
goblin
squatting
on
an
island
of
zinc
the
sulky
boy
had
made
up
the
fire
and
carrying
off
a
full
of
grey
ashes
which
he
had
raked
out
he
too
vanished
behind
the
red
curtain
evidently
ventilation
was
not
one
of
the
many
popular
specialities
of
alexander
the
great
establishment
for
the
atmosphere
of
the
restaurant
was
heavy
with
the
fumes
of
yesterday
food
the
pictorial
advertisements
of
which
were
being
now
expunged
from
the
blackboard
there
were
gay
duplicate
patches
on
the
two
sides
of
this
board
and
loveland
thought
in
faint
disgust
that
he
could
detect
a
separate
smell
for
each
dish
represented
there
was
the
horned
animal
which
might
be
anything
from
a
mere
mad
bull
to
a
minotaur
rising
head
and
shoulders
out
of
a
blue
cup
yes
certainly
the
beast
had
left
a
rich
soupy
perfume
which
mingled
curiously
with
that
of
the
defiant
fighting
cock
who
spurred
his
way
out
of
or
into
a
and
with
the
fruity
fragrance
of
a
pudding
which
belched
forth
azure
steam
alexander
the
great
fights
fair
announced
one
dangling
card
in
the
window
alexander
the
great
wins
every
time
alleged
another
alexander
the
great
gives
great
grub
dine
at
alexander
the
great
and
you
dine
like
a
prince
you
get
from
alexander
the
great
for
more
than
you
get
anywhere
else
for
a
dollar
and
so
on
one
glowing
eulogy
after
another
all
round
the
window
and
hanging
like
a
fringe
from
the
front
of
a
large
red
desk
at
the
back
of
the
room
near
the
window
of
a
kind
of
butler
pantry
the
room
itself
with
its
bare
but
tolerably
clean
floor
was
crowded
with
small
marble
tables
whose
iron
supports
were
painted
light
vermilion
to
match
the
desk
the
chairs
and
benches
in
fact
everything
that
could
be
red
in
the
room
was
red
including
doors
and
even
the
clock
on
a
rough
which
cut
one
of
horses
and
a
palm
tree
in
halves
loveland
had
warmed
himself
thoroughly
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
waldorf
and
had
lost
his
disgusted
sense
of
the
close
atmosphere
when
the
red
clock
struck
seven
at
the
same
moment
someone
pushed
aside
the
door
curtain
and
came
into
the
restaurant
from
a
passageway
at
the
back
val
turned
his
head
and
saw
a
very
handsome
very
untidy
young
jewess
her
heavy
black
hair
was
twisted
up
anyhow
on
the
top
of
her
head
and
half
a
dozen
patent
arrangements
for
waving
the
front
locks
dangled
low
over
the
double
arch
of
beautiful
brows
a
full
white
throat
which
would
seem
not
quite
long
enough
at
forty
was
gracious
in
its
ivory
curves
at
nineteen
even
though
it
rose
out
of
a
purple
flannel
that
left
the
wearer
figure
to
the
beholder
imagination
the
girl
came
in
yawning
but
at
sight
of
loveland
her
languishing
eyes
opened
wide
and
a
lovely
carnation
stained
the
peachy
sallowness
of
her
rounded
cheeks
she
bit
her
full
underlip
with
little
even
teeth
that
were
white
as
kernels
of
corn
in
contrast
with
the
coral
of
her
mouth
oh
she
exclaimed
catching
together
her
unbuttoned
wrapper
at
the
throat
and
taking
a
step
backward
towards
the
door
suddenly
she
looked
haughty
and
a
little
defiant
i
did
know
anybody
was
here
except
bill
we
do
open
till
seven
thirty
people
do
come
in
this
early
but
if
you
thank
you
i
afraid
i
not
a
customer
said
loveland
pulling
off
his
cap
and
flushing
a
little
with
embarrassment
for
himself
and
for
the
girl
this
gent
me
friend
his
name
gordon
gordon
explained
bill
the
girl
laughed
pleased
yet
half
suspicious
of
the
handsome
young
man
who
had
paid
her
the
compliment
of
taking
off
his
hat
she
was
not
used
to
men
who
did
that
even
for
pretty
girls
like
her
but
then
she
was
not
used
to
such
men
as
loveland
she
recognised
the
difference
between
him
and
the
others
in
an
instant
and
decided
that
he
was
not
guying
therefore
that
she
need
not
hold
herself
stiffly
on
guard
not
only
was
he
the
handsomest
young
man
she
had
ever
seen
but
he
was
a
swell
and
swells
did
not
patronise
alexander
the
great
she
wondered
what
he
wanted
and
why
he
should
pose
as
a
friend
of
bill
evidently
he
had
been
up
all
night
or
he
would
not
be
in
evening
dress
at
seven
in
the
morning
but
he
had
not
the
air
of
having
enjoyed
himself
perhaps
bill
had
helped
him
out
of
some
scrape
he
looked
gloomy
and
savage
like
some
gallant
and
beautiful
animal
driven
to
bay
an
effect
which
interested
the
girl
very
much
and
made
her
like
him
better
i
must
trespass
on
your
hospitality
for
a
few
minutes
val
said
hastily
until
mr
willing
has
time
to
help
me
carry
out
my
plans
for
the
day
when
he
finished
his
work
you
ai
in
anyone
way
here
i
sure
returned
the
young
woman
still
eyeing
the
mysterious
stranger
aloofly
but
with
admiration
she
put
up
one
plump
hand
and
uneasily
touched
the
dangling
as
if
she
wished
to
tuck
them
out
of
sight
this
is
miss
izzie
that
i
told
you
about
announced
bill
in
his
best
society
manner
the
boss
daughter
the
girl
bowed
as
she
had
seen
heroines
do
on
being
introduced
to
heroes
in
plays
at
an
adjacent
melodramatic
theatre
how
often
must
i
tell
you
bill
not
to
call
me
izzie
miss
isidora
if
you
please
i
hate
izzie
and
she
glanced
out
of
the
corners
of
her
long
eyes
at
loveland
you
an
actor
ai
you
mr
gordon
she
asked
no
i
not
replied
val
stiffening
slightly
excuse
me
if
i
said
the
wrong
thing
cooed
the
girl
in
her
soft
rather
guttural
tones
sweet
as
if
she
spoke
with
honey
in
her
mouth
i
did
see
how
bill
come
to
have
a
swell
friend
unless
was
an
actor
bill
used
to
be
always
around
the
theatres
before
he
worked
for
us
so
i
thought
she
paused
still
gazing
through
drooped
lashes
then
turned
away
with
a
little
shrug
but
i
must
go
i
only
came
down
like
this
bill
to
have
a
look
round
for
pa
because
he
sick
with
a
cold
i
told
him
i
see
after
things
till
he
better
he
do
like
me
foolin
round
in
business
hours
with
a
lot
of
men
staring
and
passing
remarks
she
threw
another
glance
at
val
to
see
if
he
were
impressed
by
this
exclusiveness
but
he
feels
too
bad
to
care
today
i
go
pour
myself
into
my
glad
rags
now
and
be
down
again
as
soon
as
i
can
boss
sick
is
he
said
bill
who
was
finishing
his
work
on
the
room
side
of
the
blackboard
by
indicating
a
lobster
with
thick
scarlet
strokes
of
fast
flying
chalk
wo
be
down
till
the
daughter
of
alexander
the
great
showed
her
dimples
you
think
that
means
you
get
a
free
meal
i
guess
when
the
cat
away
and
has
got
a
pretty
kind
kitten
for
his
understudy
bill
finished
we
ell
you
know
i
soft
do
you
if
you
want
anything
look
sharp
and
get
it
or
pa
might
change
his
mind
and
pop
in
wo
you
have
something
mr
gordon
she
went
on
hospitably
dropping
the
rough
and
ready
manner
she
used
with
bill
for
another
attempt
at
imitating
the
stage
heroine
who
was
her
ideal
of
feminine
graciousness
if
you
trust
me
till
afternoon
for
the
price
of
a
breakfast
val
answered
trying
to
speak
lightly
o
she
exclaimed
i
did
ask
you
to
pity
if
i
ca
invite
a
friend
to
have
a
meal
without
anyone
making
a
fuss
i
was
just
guying
about
bill
besides
he
different
pa
throws
in
his
dinner
and
supper
as
part
of
his
pay
and
he
supposed
to
look
out
for
his
own
breakfast
he
gets
good
money
here
i
sure
and
if
he
so
soft
that
every
old
applewoman
or
lame
bootblack
can
wheedle
his
money
off
him
why
his
business
and
pa
says
we
ought
to
learn
him
better
instead
of
encouraging
him
to
go
on
the
way
he
does
that
why
i
have
to
sneak
him
a
doughnut
and
a
cup
of
coffee
on
the
sly
sometimes
but
i
want
you
to
understand
i
you
to
breakfast
as
a
gentleman
friend
of
mine
and
i
shall
be
real
hurt
if
you
talk
about
paying
very
well
i
accept
your
invitation
with
thanks
provided
breakfast
with
me
said
val
as
gallantly
as
if
he
were
addressing
a
duchess
or
a
popular
chorus
girl
my
i
could
do
that
answered
isidora
pa
be
wild
if
he
got
to
know
i
eat
a
meal
in
the
restaurant
we
a
parlour
upstairs
she
went
on
with
a
pretty
air
of
importance
and
the
hired
girl
brings
our
meals
pa
and
mine
for
he
does
have
his
down
either
except
when
he
in
a
hurry
and
just
picks
up
a
bite
as
he
goes
but
you
be
seeing
me
soon
again
she
reassured
loveland
i
shall
be
at
the
desk
in
pa
place
this
was
her
exit
speech
and
she
made
it
close
to
the
red
curtain
which
in
another
moment
had
blotted
her
out
of
sight
from
some
region
beyond
the
drapery
now
came
an
appetizing
smell
of
breakfast
coffee
frizzling
ham
and
frying
sausages
the
sulky
boy
his
face
shining
with
kitchen
soap
came
in
with
a
tray
full
of
dishes
and
a
german
followed
who
stared
with
goggling
gooseberry
eyes
at
loveland
the
while
he
clawed
clean
cups
and
saucers
from
a
hidden
cupboard
not
fifteen
minutes
had
passed
when
miss
alexander
alias
solomon
reappeared
this
time
in
all
her
glory
panting
with
haste
and
the
snugness
of
her
stays
perhaps
she
had
drawn
them
in
extra
tight
yet
smiling
in
conscious
beauty
my
but
you
got
up
to
kill
this
morning
exclaimed
bill
willing
and
the
fair
isidora
darted
a
vexed
glance
at
him
for
she
had
wanted
the
swell
to
believe
that
this
gorgeousness
was
her
daily
toilet
she
had
put
on
a
red
cloth
dress
which
might
have
been
made
to
suit
the
restaurant
as
well
as
the
wearer
her
bust
was
magnificently
full
and
her
waist
impossibly
small
she
had
powdered
her
olive
face
to
a
pearly
whiteness
and
her
black
pompadour
with
its
bright
undulations
looked
as
if
it
would
have
scorned
the
plebian
aid
of
metal
now
the
show
ready
to
begin
she
announced
with
a
smile
and
a
glance
all
all
for
loveland
and
she
was
so
lusciously
handsome
in
her
richly
developed
young
beauty
that
val
despite
the
revolt
of
his
fastidiousness
admired
her
reluctantly
no
customers
had
come
in
yet
and
isidora
insisted
that
gordon
should
have
his
breakfast
bill
she
said
could
go
into
the
kitchen
and
sneak
something
from
the
cook
but
it
was
loveland
whim
not
to
eat
unless
his
chum
ate
with
him
and
isidora
secretly
liked
him
the
better
for
his
loyalty
to
one
so
humble
not
knowing
that
it
was
a
new
development
she
had
little
of
bill
delicacy
in
the
matter
of
asking
questions
and
found
it
so
impossible
to
restrain
her
curiosity
that
while
loveland
disposed
of
ham
and
egg
coffee
and
a
doughnut
she
hovered
near
the
table
trying
with
all
her
skill
to
probe
the
handsome
mystery
inclined
to
be
reserved
at
first
it
soon
occurred
to
loveland
that
since
any
port
in
a
storm
was
better
than
no
port
he
had
better
enlist
miss
alexander
aid
in
response
to
her
bids
for
confidences
he
said
that
he
had
landed
in
america
yesterday
and
had
gone
to
the
to
find
on
his
arrival
that
his
clothes
had
been
stolen
out
of
his
luggage
by
an
english
servant
he
added
that
his
london
bankers
had
been
dilatory
about
instructing
their
new
york
correspondents
that
when
the
hotel
people
for
some
extraordinary
reason
known
only
to
themselves
demanded
immediate
payment
he
had
been
practically
penniless
and
had
walked
out
in
a
rage
leaving
everything
even
his
overcoat
not
only
did
he
keep
the
secret
of
his
real
name
and
title
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
mention
either
his
failure
to
get
in
at
houses
where
he
had
left
letters
of
introduction
or
his
encounter
with
milton
yet
glibly
as
the
story
ran
it
seemed
to
the
daughter
of
alexander
the
great
like
a
fairy
tale
she
with
quick
feminine
instinct
recognised
the
vast
social
distance
between
gordon
and
bill
willing
more
poignantly
than
did
bill
himself
who
had
now
almost
forgotten
it
in
friendly
association
but
even
so
to
have
sitting
at
one
of
her
father
tables
hungrily
eating
a
breakfast
on
her
invitation
a
young
man
who
could
engage
a
cabin
on
the
and
a
suite
at
the
appeared
like
a
brilliant
dream
she
had
never
before
seen
anyone
quite
so
gallant
and
as
bill
willing
friend
no
not
even
when
she
walked
fifth
avenue
on
easter
sunday
at
the
hour
of
church
parade
and
she
was
distressed
at
the
thought
that
she
would
soon
lose
the
wondrous
visitor
forever
she
longed
desperately
to
attach
him
to
herself
in
some
way
but
could
not
see
the
way
eagerly
she
began
to
plan
a
course
of
action
thrusting
bill
advice
aside
what
was
bill
that
he
should
give
advice
she
asked
scornfully
for
bill
had
never
looked
into
her
languishing
eyes
and
he
was
to
her
a
mere
scarcely
a
man
at
all
what
did
bill
know
of
uptown
and
the
ways
of
swells
but
she
intimated
she
had
some
knowledge
of
smart
life
she
had
friends
and
rosenstein
who
were
rich
though
indeed
no
richer
than
pa
and
sometimes
she
dined
with
them
at
their
flat
in
one
hundred
and
street
or
went
to
an
uptown
theatre
in
their
company
therefore
she
was
competent
to
advise
and
to
say
what
was
what
she
offered
to
send
a
district
messenger
to
the
for
the
telegram
gordon
was
expecting
and
any
letters
which
might
have
arrived
he
can
bring
you
the
lot
she
arranged
and
then
you
can
send
him
to
your
bank
unless
they
make
you
show
up
to
be
identified
anyhow
you
can
wait
here
for
news
you
can
go
on
sitting
where
you
are
or
you
can
come
and
stay
by
me
at
the
desk
if
the
tables
fill
up
with
folks
for
breakfast
loveland
face
slowly
reddened
and
his
eyes
grew
troubled
you
need
mind
about
the
money
for
the
messenger
she
said
quickly
you
can
pay
me
back
afterwards
if
you
so
awful
proud
why
of
course
i
pay
you
back
val
assured
her
but
er
the
fact
is
he
hesitated
trying
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
tangled
web
gordon
had
woven
the
fact
is
i
he
wondered
if
he
could
bear
to
go
to
the
hotel
and
thus
escape
the
difficulty
about
the
name
but
pictured
himself
arriving
in
evening
dress
by
broad
daylight
and
felt
his
gorge
rise
at
the
degradation
the
fact
is
anything
coming
for
me
at
the
waldorf
will
have
on
it
the
name
of
loveland
marquis
of
loveland
will
be
the
address
on
my
letters
my
goodness
you
fly
high
exclaimed
isidora
dimpling
i
guess
it
no
wonder
they
gave
you
a
whole
suite
she
pronounced
it
of
rooms
but
that
all
right
you
put
on
a
card
what
you
want
the
messenger
boy
should
do
and
you
need
be
afraid
to
trust
him
these
little
fellers
are
safe
as
banks
with
this
the
first
paying
customer
arrived
demanding
beefsteak
and
apple
pie
for
breakfast
then
as
if
he
had
given
the
signal
others
poured
after
him
all
in
a
hurry
but
all
and
all
bolting
their
meals
meals
composed
it
seemed
to
val
of
the
most
extraordinary
dishes
with
such
incredible
speed
that
the
englishman
was
startled
by
the
time
he
had
finished
writing
his
instructions
and
a
uniformed
youth
had
darted
off
with
them
almost
the
whole
first
contingent
of
breakfasters
had
gone
and
given
place
to
another
alexander
the
great
clients
consisted
apparently
of
respectable
employés
of
lower
business
houses
if
they
had
not
all
been
employed
loveland
reflected
they
would
not
have
been
in
such
desperate
haste
but
then
he
had
not
yet
studied
the
american
temperament
north
of
dixie
bill
willing
habit
was
when
paid
for
his
day
work
to
find
a
seat
in
a
small
adjacent
park
and
play
with
the
children
whose
nursery
it
was
there
by
witchcraft
or
wizardry
his
money
was
frequently
wheedled
from
his
pocket
and
often
by
the
time
he
returned
to
alexander
the
great
for
early
dinner
he
was
practically
a
pauper
it
was
after
such
conjuring
tricks
that
he
migrated
at
nightfall
to
his
country
estate
as
he
called
central
park
and
got
through
the
hours
as
best
he
could
till
six
next
morning
today
however
he
was
encouraged
to
linger
in
the
warm
restaurant
alexander
daughter
being
supreme
in
authority
during
her
absence
isidora
saw
that
bill
had
the
food
he
liked
best
for
breakfast
a
steaming
pile
of
buckwheat
cakes
trimmed
round
the
edges
with
crisp
brown
lace
and
oozing
syrup
at
every
pore
also
she
sent
him
a
copy
of
new
york
light
without
having
even
glanced
at
the
front
page
although
a
gentleman
friend
who
had
paid
her
a
great
deal
of
attention
last
summer
was
at
the
beginning
of
his
trial
for
a
really
exciting
murder
isidora
dreaded
yet
longed
to
see
the
messenger
return
and
at
sight
of
the
slim
figure
in
blue
bobbing
past
the
big
window
she
started
so
violently
as
to
cover
the
floor
with
an
avalanche
of
waiters
checks
which
had
littered
her
father
desk
the
youth
entered
the
restaurant
and
went
straight
to
the
table
where
gordon
still
sat
isidora
could
not
hear
a
word
of
the
conversation
which
ensued
but
from
under
her
eyelashes
she
contrived
to
see
without
seeming
to
see
how
the
messenger
shook
his
head
in
answer
to
questions
and
how
gordon
face
grew
ever
more
blank
until
it
hardened
into
an
expression
of
hopelessness
she
was
sure
that
the
boy
had
brought
neither
letter
nor
telegram
and
that
something
had
gone
very
wrong
indeed
with
her
mysterious
guest
calculations
an
inspiration
prompted
her
hastily
to
beckon
bill
who
was
earning
the
continued
hospitality
of
the
restaurant
by
trotting
in
with
clean
plates
from
the
kitchen
and
trotting
back
with
dirty
ones
here
take
this
and
pay
the
messenger
she
whispered
i
guess
your
friend
had
a
disappointment
bill
obeyed
but
did
not
at
once
come
back
when
the
youth
had
been
paid
and
had
shot
away
up
the
street
as
if
through
a
pneumatic
tube
bill
lingered
in
consultation
with
the
pale
young
man
at
the
table
something
up
isidora
said
to
herself
in
an
agony
of
curiosity
but
what
the
something
was
she
could
not
find
out
till
breakfast
was
over
and
the
room
clear
of
customers
it
was
by
this
time
after
nine
a
late
hour
at
alexander
the
restaurant
which
the
regular
clients
were
deserting
now
for
business
but
others
might
drop
in
for
a
piece
of
pie
at
any
moment
so
isidora
caught
at
a
propitiously
quiet
instant
as
she
would
have
flown
at
a
moving
electric
tram
the
cable
i
expected
has
arrived
explained
gordon
it
all
right
of
course
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
and
i
not
really
worried
for
i
have
paid
enough
attention
to
the
difference
of
time
between
london
and
new
york
i
must
send
again
later
in
the
day
when
there
will
be
letters
too
perhaps
and
people
meanwhile
meanwhile
stay
where
you
are
and
make
yourself
at
home
cut
in
isidora
hospitably
nevertheless
she
was
anxious
when
she
thought
of
her
father
and
the
inevitable
moment
of
his
coming
downstairs
with
illness
and
cross
as
a
bear
with
a
sore
head
pa
would
want
to
have
the
beautiful
young
man
in
evening
clothes
satisfactorily
explained
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
the
girl
that
he
would
be
rather
difficult
to
explain
people
and
things
were
always
difficult
to
explain
to
alexander
especially
when
he
was
under
the
weather
but
there
was
one
way
out
of
the
scrape
and
isidora
snatched
at
it
suddenly
with
a
leap
of
the
heart
all
might
be
well
should
she
prevail
upon
gordon
to
accept
another
loan
from
her
if
he
liked
to
call
it
a
loan
she
had
been
saving
up
her
allowance
to
buy
a
new
and
had
already
set
her
heart
on
the
thing
she
would
have
but
she
would
deplete
the
sum
by
a
third
for
gordon
sake
if
he
would
take
the
money
and
spend
it
as
if
it
were
his
own
for
the
good
of
the
house
if
he
indulged
in
pickled
clams
or
or
cold
fried
oysters
at
intervals
of
say
every
hour
under
her
father
eye
he
would
continue
to
be
welcome
to
his
place
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
even
though
costume
and
conduct
might
appear
open
to
curious
criticism
thank
you
but
mr
willing
has
given
me
a
piece
of
good
advice
said
val
if
it
had
been
for
him
i
should
have
thought
of
it
perhaps
he
suggests
my
pawning
a
few
things
i
have
on
me
now
was
isidora
time
to
speak
and
she
offered
her
alternative
suggestion
but
with
some
stammering
and
confusion
under
the
growing
discouragement
in
gordon
dark
blue
eyes
nor
did
he
let
her
stumble
on
very
far
as
soon
as
he
gathered
the
drift
of
her
faltering
words
he
broke
in
thanking
her
sincerely
saying
that
she
was
most
awfully
kind
but
he
could
trespass
any
further
upon
her
goodness
according
to
willing
there
was
a
pawnshop
just
round
the
corner
they
two
would
go
there
immediately
and
then
with
money
to
pay
his
debt
to
her
as
well
as
tide
over
unforeseen
delays
he
would
be
glad
to
come
back
for
a
time
not
only
had
isidora
never
seen
a
man
like
gordon
but
she
had
never
heard
any
man
talk
as
he
did
unless
perhaps
on
the
stage
she
could
hardly
believe
yet
that
he
was
not
an
actor
and
that
the
of
loveland
was
not
the
name
of
some
character
he
had
played
it
needs
hardihood
to
show
oneself
at
nine
of
a
cold
sunshiny
morning
in
evening
clothes
loveland
had
not
by
any
means
got
rid
of
his
vanity
with
his
other
possessions
and
he
would
rather
have
run
the
gauntlet
at
the
risk
of
his
life
from
cowboy
bullets
or
indian
arrows
than
face
the
grins
and
stares
of
a
downtown
new
york
crowd
this
time
bill
did
offer
his
overcoat
and
press
the
offer
but
to
do
loveland
justice
its
shabbiness
and
inadequacy
were
not
his
principal
reasons
for
refusing
bill
blazer
was
not
much
warmer
than
tissue
paper
its
sole
virtue
save
on
a
hot
day
of
summer
being
the
fact
that
it
would
cover
a
dickey
and
celluloid
cuffs
that
had
no
visible
means
of
support
luckily
for
loveland
fortitude
however
the
ordeal
or
the
part
of
it
was
brief
he
was
whisked
round
the
corner
and
hurried
mercifully
into
a
dingy
den
which
bill
willing
seemed
to
regard
as
a
kind
of
home
from
home
or
at
the
least
a
warehouse
loveland
denuded
his
shirt
of
studs
took
the
gold
links
out
of
his
cuffs
and
produced
his
watch
asking
almost
humbly
how
much
would
be
allowed
for
the
lot
the
watch
was
of
the
sleeve
links
the
simplest
he
had
owned
were
destitute
of
precious
stones
and
the
pawnbroker
having
examined
the
offered
objects
with
an
air
of
disparagement
mentioned
the
sum
of
nine
dollars
when
urged
to
make
a
higher
bid
he
remarked
that
he
was
no
santa
claus
and
at
last
showed
himself
so
indifferent
that
loveland
was
glad
to
exchange
his
despised
belongings
for
one
dollar
less
than
the
sum
at
first
refused
i
expect
the
old
curmudge
will
be
on
for
his
scene
by
the
time
we
get
back
said
bill
as
they
returned
to
alexander
the
great
after
an
absence
of
nearly
an
hour
during
which
time
loveland
had
provided
his
with
cheap
celluloid
studs
but
curmudge
alias
solomon
alias
alexander
was
still
absent
his
understudy
izzie
of
the
continued
to
reign
alone
over
a
kingdom
of
tables
and
empty
red
chairs
awaiting
their
next
occupants
but
sixty
minutes
had
changed
her
oddly
she
looked
up
with
a
nervous
start
when
loveland
came
in
with
bill
and
hid
in
her
lap
the
newspaper
which
had
been
lying
before
her
on
the
desk
chapter
nineteen
the
morning
paper
i
shall
be
able
to
pay
you
for
my
breakfast
and
the
messenger
now
said
loveland
and
if
you
a
private
room
i
like
to
engage
it
till
afternoon
when
i
can
send
to
the
hotel
again
and
find
the
cable
telling
me
how
and
where
to
get
the
money
on
my
letter
of
credit
rather
awkward
being
here
in
these
clothes
and
we
have
got
a
private
room
replied
the
girl
except
our
own
parlour
i
wish
we
had
because
because
i
guess
you
just
about
right
you
to
be
here
today
sitting
around
dressed
that
way
you
might
be
noticed
and
and
she
hesitated
then
began
to
speak
again
quickly
in
a
low
voice
see
here
gordon
i
know
but
i
better
tell
you
something
bend
down
i
do
want
the
waiters
to
hear
dutchy
do
catch
onto
english
much
but
folks
always
understand
when
you
do
want
to
of
course
it
all
right
about
bill
as
he
your
friend
i
suppose
he
knows
what
enquired
val
bending
down
towards
her
as
she
had
asked
his
elbows
on
the
counter
while
bill
tactfully
retired
out
of
earshot
why
it
it
in
the
paper
this
morning
oh
the
blood
sprang
to
val
face
his
scar
showing
very
white
no
need
it
seemed
for
further
questions
he
thought
he
knew
what
miss
isidora
alexander
had
been
reading
in
the
paper
and
cursed
himself
for
having
uttered
the
name
of
loveland
if
he
had
not
told
her
that
enquiries
must
be
made
at
the
waldorf
for
lord
loveland
cablegram
and
letters
she
would
not
associate
gordon
bill
willing
friend
with
the
hero
of
new
york
light
story
that
cad
milton
had
evidently
made
up
some
tale
on
recovering
his
disgusting
senses
a
tale
not
too
damaging
to
himself
and
had
named
his
assailant
give
me
the
paper
please
val
demanded
not
now
said
the
girl
dutchy
looking
and
that
silly
boy
blinkey
has
just
come
in
i
do
know
as
dutchy
reads
english
and
likely
blinkey
bothers
about
the
news
even
when
he
gets
time
but
you
never
can
tell
they
may
have
read
and
they
may
be
putting
things
together
already
better
not
let
guess
we
alludin
to
anything
in
the
paper
is
it
about
my
knocking
a
man
down
asked
loveland
yes
a
swell
well
known
in
i
seen
his
name
often
in
chat
and
it
about
you
at
the
hotel
too
suddenly
it
seemed
to
val
that
he
would
not
have
the
heart
to
read
that
article
about
himself
in
the
newspapers
his
sensitive
vanity
sent
a
sharp
twinge
through
his
body
as
if
a
nerve
had
been
touched
with
the
point
of
a
knife
that
scene
of
his
humiliation
in
the
waldorf
restaurant
and
afterwards
in
the
hall
how
could
he
bear
to
see
it
all
set
out
in
vulgar
print
accompanied
perhaps
by
an
interview
with
the
hotel
employé
who
had
turned
him
into
the
street
no
he
could
not
look
at
the
paper
could
not
see
himself
held
up
to
public
ridicule
probably
by
the
pen
of
the
man
he
had
ordered
from
his
door
with
cadwallader
hunter
yesterday
in
the
morning
physically
loveland
was
not
a
coward
but
touch
his
vanity
and
he
shrank
as
if
with
fear
and
mortified
to
the
quick
as
his
imagination
pictured
the
amusement
his
plight
must
be
at
this
moment
creating
round
thousands
of
breakfast
tables
he
broke
in
upon
the
girl
revelations
almost
roughly
never
mind
that
part
now
he
said
that
nothing
has
the
man
milton
set
the
police
on
me
nope
i
guess
not
there
a
kind
of
interview
with
him
in
the
paper
and
he
says
he
deserved
what
he
got
for
havin
anything
to
do
with
a
man
of
your
sort
he
says
after
he
told
you
exactly
what
he
thought
of
you
you
hit
him
from
behind
which
i
do
believe
because
you
that
kind
i
bet
thank
you
said
loveland
looking
so
handsome
in
the
pallor
of
his
anger
that
the
jewish
girl
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
face
her
sensuous
temperament
made
her
adore
beauty
of
which
she
saw
little
in
her
everyday
life
it
was
because
she
loved
beauty
and
colour
that
she
chose
red
and
other
dresses
for
herself
because
she
loved
beauty
she
studied
and
pinched
in
her
plump
waist
to
what
she
considered
perfect
elegance
of
form
because
she
loved
beauty
and
thought
she
was
attaining
it
she
covered
her
smooth
polished
skin
with
pearl
powder
and
tortured
her
hair
with
metal
because
she
loved
beauty
she
was
now
ready
to
fling
her
soul
at
this
stranger
feet
having
read
the
newspaper
she
believed
him
to
be
a
blackguard
but
she
had
not
been
taught
a
high
standard
of
virtue
for
men
and
if
she
had
she
would
still
have
been
fiercely
ready
to
protect
this
splendid
scoundrel
no
i
not
that
kind
of
man
val
echoed
her
words
evidently
the
cowardly
beast
must
have
picked
himself
up
before
he
was
seen
otherwise
as
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
fat
back
his
story
about
having
been
hit
from
behind
would
hardly
have
held
water
will
the
police
do
anything
on
their
own
responsibility
do
you
think
not
unless
somebody
sends
them
lookin
for
you
i
hope
isidora
reassured
him
flattered
that
she
should
be
taken
into
consultation
this
milton
says
in
the
interview
he
do
want
to
be
mussed
up
in
a
scandal
or
called
on
as
a
witness
against
you
in
a
it
his
own
scandal
broke
out
loveland
he
knows
i
could
defend
myself
only
too
well
and
being
a
cad
himself
he
does
know
that
i
would
bring
in
certain
names
still
the
hotel
people
may
try
to
make
trouble
the
girl
suggested
it
was
so
early
when
the
messenger
got
there
they
had
read
the
papers
because
if
they
had
they
could
have
followed
the
boy
here
if
they
wanted
i
shall
have
to
send
again
for
the
cablegram
no
matter
what
happens
said
val
i
must
get
money
sure
you
get
it
isidora
asked
in
a
confidential
yet
somewhat
doubtful
tone
of
course
i
sure
i
have
my
letter
of
credit
the
one
thing
i
did
manage
to
keep
yes
but
there
is
any
but
cut
in
loveland
impatiently
it
certain
to
be
all
right
this
afternoon
at
latest
the
cable
will
have
come
to
the
hotel
and
then
i
shall
know
what
to
do
even
supposing
the
police
should
arrest
me
for
that
affair
well
at
worst
the
trouble
ought
to
be
over
and
done
with
in
a
day
or
two
oh
indeed
it
would
exclaimed
the
pretty
jewess
i
do
know
what
might
happen
to
you
you
be
careful
wo
you
if
only
to
please
me
and
her
eyes
were
large
and
beseeching
you
very
kind
to
take
an
interest
said
val
really
grateful
though
he
had
to
restrain
an
impulse
to
draw
back
from
her
advances
of
course
i
do
want
to
be
let
in
for
a
scandal
which
might
do
others
harm
as
well
as
me
and
would
if
that
beast
milton
could
manage
it
not
exactly
pining
to
see
the
inside
of
a
new
york
gaol
which
you
seem
to
think
i
in
danger
of
doing
things
are
bad
enough
as
it
is
and
his
face
darkened
for
he
thought
that
after
the
loathesome
publicity
the
newspapers
were
now
giving
the
name
of
loveland
he
might
have
difficulty
in
bringing
down
such
game
as
he
had
crossed
the
sea
to
seek
also
he
remembered
with
a
pang
lesley
dearmer
prophecy
that
the
louisville
journals
would
reprint
new
york
gossip
oh
i
sorry
you
think
things
here
are
so
bad
retorted
isidora
flushed
and
pouting
you
know
i
do
mean
things
here
protested
val
with
less
truth
than
politeness
you
too
good
to
me
and
i
appreciate
it
all
immensely
do
you
she
asked
her
eyes
liquid
of
course
i
do
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
prove
that
before
long
she
blushed
to
her
mind
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
a
young
man
could
prove
that
he
appreciated
a
girl
goodness
to
him
by
making
love
to
her
and
she
could
almost
have
fainted
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
what
it
would
be
to
have
this
glorious
hero
villain
though
he
might
be
as
a
lover
already
she
had
a
dim
yet
intoxicating
vision
of
herself
a
bride
in
white
silk
or
should
it
be
cream
satin
and
a
wreath
of
artificial
orange
blossoms
amid
clouds
of
tulle
there
would
be
difficulties
a
hundred
difficulties
of
which
the
greatest
was
now
upstairs
enjoying
a
rest
but
who
cared
for
a
love
that
ran
smooth
and
isidora
thrilled
as
her
fancy
held
a
spyglass
up
to
the
future
well
she
said
warmly
i
mean
to
go
on
being
good
better
best
to
you
for
i
studying
out
a
plan
to
get
your
things
away
from
the
hotel
and
all
the
same
to
keep
you
out
of
trouble
you
a
foreigner
and
do
understand
our
ways
yet
but
i
see
you
through
all
right
how
are
you
going
to
do
that
my
guardian
angel
val
smiled
at
the
pretty
jewess
isidora
had
the
sensation
of
being
bathed
in
perfumed
cream
his
guardian
angel
she
had
been
called
a
number
of
nice
things
such
as
a
real
beaut
a
and
a
floradora
but
no
one
had
ever
hailed
her
as
his
guardian
angel
before
and
with
all
her
heart
she
vowed
that
she
would
live
up
to
the
name
i
do
know
exactly
yet
how
i
do
it
she
admitted
but
you
leave
it
to
me
and
it
be
done
you
see
only
give
me
an
order
signed
to
bring
away
anything
of
yours
from
the
hotel
meantime
i
thought
of
one
thing
which
is
you
better
not
be
seen
here
till
we
sure
they
ai
onto
you
through
that
messenger
boy
i
tell
you
what
i
got
a
lady
friend
in
this
street
johnny
gernsbacher
who
lookin
after
an
empty
house
that
for
rent
a
caretaker
asked
loveland
i
guess
that
right
me
and
gernsbacher
good
friends
she
a
widow
lady
quite
old
so
she
do
for
a
chaperon
pa
had
her
boy
here
once
to
wait
and
then
through
me
and
friends
of
mine
he
got
a
better
job
outside
she
be
glad
to
do
me
a
good
turn
you
can
see
to
things
here
for
five
minutes
till
i
run
across
and
ask
if
let
you
stay
there
in
the
house
as
a
friend
of
mine
till
you
have
time
to
look
around
see
to
things
echoed
loveland
blankly
yes
if
anybody
comes
in
they
take
you
for
a
swell
waiter
in
those
clothes
they
think
alexander
the
great
startin
in
for
uptown
style
she
laughed
with
amusement
at
the
joke
and
loveland
laughed
too
though
not
very
heartily
he
was
not
enchanted
at
the
idea
of
being
mistaken
for
a
swell
waiter
but
beggars
must
not
be
choosers
and
he
offered
no
objection
to
the
plan
wrapping
over
her
head
a
red
crocheted
scarf
which
she
called
a
fascinator
isidora
darted
into
the
street
panting
with
haste
lest
the
worst
should
happen
in
her
absence
and
her
father
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
downstairs
but
she
had
seen
him
last
dozing
over
the
police
news
in
a
quilted
and
that
was
such
a
short
time
ago
that
she
hardly
thought
there
was
danger
of
a
surprise
gernsbacher
must
have
been
very
accessible
and
easily
persuaded
for
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
girl
was
back
again
flushed
with
triumph
it
all
right
she
announced
beccy
g
standing
in
the
basement
door
waiting
for
you
to
pop
in
bill
you
show
him
the
way
to
beccy
goodbye
gordon
do
stay
here
another
minute
i
be
over
as
soon
as
i
can
to
tell
you
what
up
and
i
send
bill
along
at
noon
with
something
good
for
your
dinner
carried
off
his
feet
by
her
enthusiasm
loveland
did
not
stop
for
further
argument
caught
by
an
eddy
in
the
tide
of
fate
he
let
himself
be
swept
away
chapter
twenty
a
back
number
nothing
had
happened
when
bill
willing
came
at
twelve
to
find
loveland
an
inappropriately
ornamental
figure
keeping
guard
in
gernsbacher
kitchen
during
that
lady
absence
on
a
shopping
expedition
nothing
had
happened
worth
reporting
except
that
alexander
the
great
was
around
again
isidora
had
sent
wrapped
in
a
japanese
paper
napkin
a
and
a
generous
slice
of
a
delicacy
strange
to
the
englishman
palate
bill
had
brought
food
for
himself
too
that
part
of
his
wage
which
he
took
out
in
kind
preferring
a
cold
picnic
meal
with
his
friend
to
the
hot
meat
and
potatoes
he
might
have
had
at
the
restaurant
he
also
was
provided
with
pie
and
a
sandwich
and
though
his
portion
was
smaller
than
isidora
surreptitious
gift
to
gordon
he
had
smuggled
in
his
pocket
a
bottle
of
ginger
ale
for
both
have
you
read
the
beastly
newspaper
article
about
me
val
forced
himself
to
enquire
no
answered
bill
i
ai
seen
it
miss
izzie
offered
me
the
paper
but
i
well
i
did
care
to
read
it
seemed
as
if
sorter
be
spying
on
you
behind
your
back
you
a
good
fellow
said
val
it
was
a
new
idea
only
born
to
him
last
night
that
a
shabby
waif
like
bill
a
mere
autumn
leaf
blown
here
and
there
by
contrary
winds
of
circumstance
could
be
a
good
fellow
with
the
heart
of
a
man
but
here
was
such
a
one
and
it
seemed
to
lord
loveland
that
the
leaf
was
very
like
a
gentleman
i
do
see
where
the
goodness
comes
in
protested
bill
modestly
but
i
can
run
back
and
sneak
the
paper
if
you
changed
your
mind
and
want
a
squint
at
it
no
thank
you
said
val
though
he
half
scorned
himself
for
moral
cowardice
i
no
wish
to
see
how
deep
new
york
journalism
has
pushed
me
into
the
mud
bill
who
did
not
wish
to
be
overheard
gossiping
about
his
affairs
by
the
returning
gernsbacher
pottered
away
after
the
meal
promising
to
run
in
later
with
a
message
from
miss
izzie
if
the
young
lady
were
prevented
from
coming
in
person
if
isidora
had
mapped
out
a
definite
plan
she
had
not
confided
it
to
bill
but
he
had
little
doubt
that
her
idea
would
pan
out
all
right
because
she
was
a
mighty
smart
girl
when
she
set
her
wits
to
work
some
hours
passed
and
loveland
became
as
restless
as
a
caged
lion
lately
imported
from
his
native
desert
it
was
only
his
horror
of
vague
atrocities
which
might
be
perpetrated
by
the
new
york
police
horrors
such
as
he
had
read
or
heard
of
which
restrained
him
from
rushing
out
of
his
dreary
hiding
place
even
at
the
price
of
being
hooted
in
his
evening
clothes
in
the
full
glare
of
noonday
after
all
he
said
to
himself
bitterly
those
who
might
see
him
perambulating
twelfth
street
thus
unsuitably
clad
would
only
do
as
isidora
had
suggested
take
him
for
a
swell
waiter
but
he
did
not
like
that
dark
haunting
vision
of
the
police
and
constrained
himself
to
patience
rebecca
gernsbacher
returned
from
her
morning
shopping
to
ask
almost
as
many
questions
as
she
drew
breaths
freezing
into
a
cold
statue
of
suspicion
as
her
mysterious
guest
froze
into
reticence
not
having
heard
the
name
of
loveland
she
did
not
associate
any
sensational
headlines
in
the
morning
paper
with
isidora
swell
mash
but
there
was
no
crime
between
pocket
picking
and
murder
of
which
she
did
not
believe
the
handsome
sulky
fugitive
easily
capable
loveland
had
parted
with
his
watch
but
there
was
a
battered
one
day
bee
clock
in
gernsbacher
untidy
kitchen
and
he
had
begun
to
tell
himself
gloomily
that
it
would
soon
be
too
late
to
draw
money
from
any
bank
when
isidora
appeared
in
great
splendour
at
the
basement
door
she
had
on
a
large
picture
hat
of
red
velvet
nodding
with
cheap
ostrich
plumes
which
shaded
from
palest
pink
to
deepest
magenta
and
in
her
electric
seal
coat
she
looked
as
little
like
a
lady
as
a
beautiful
girl
could
possibly
look
but
she
was
enchanted
with
herself
and
evidently
expected
to
impress
loveland
by
her
taste
and
elegance
well
she
panted
having
kissed
her
friend
beccy
and
dusted
off
a
chair
with
the
big
muff
which
matched
her
cloak
well
i
got
news
for
you
gordon
guess
what
it
is
val
was
in
no
mood
for
graceful
badinage
but
he
forced
himself
to
reply
smilingly
that
he
could
not
guess
and
was
anxious
to
hear
i
began
to
think
you
were
never
coming
he
added
which
remark
was
more
flattering
to
isidora
than
to
gernsbacher
the
girl
pleased
at
his
impatience
which
made
her
conscious
of
her
own
importance
gaily
plunged
into
her
narrative
what
she
had
done
and
why
she
had
been
so
long
in
doing
it
in
the
first
place
pa
had
been
cross
and
had
wanted
her
to
go
out
but
when
she
had
teased
he
had
only
grumbled
a
little
and
directly
after
dinner
before
bill
came
back
she
had
taken
an
l
train
downtown
to
consult
the
husband
of
a
great
friend
of
hers
this
gentleman
she
had
persuaded
to
leave
business
he
being
a
tobacco
merchant
and
to
drop
in
at
the
with
the
object
of
making
certain
enquiries
she
had
not
she
said
confided
any
secrets
to
her
friend
though
she
was
sure
she
might
have
done
so
safely
but
had
merely
pleaded
a
passionate
yearning
for
further
details
of
the
story
in
new
york
light
what
were
the
hotel
people
going
to
do
were
they
searching
for
the
englishman
and
if
so
had
they
got
upon
his
track
rosenstein
being
an
occasional
customer
of
the
waldorf
bar
when
he
had
on
his
gladdest
rags
and
was
out
to
do
himself
well
did
not
hesitate
to
undertake
the
mission
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
asked
questions
without
arousing
any
suspicion
that
he
was
actuated
by
a
deeper
motive
than
idle
curiosity
and
he
learned
that
the
staff
of
the
took
but
little
interest
in
the
gentleman
calling
himself
lord
loveland
the
englishman
had
gone
away
without
paying
for
his
rooms
as
the
newspapers
had
said
the
hotel
people
admitted
but
goods
worth
about
the
amount
owing
had
been
left
behind
possibly
the
owner
would
redeem
the
things
and
if
not
it
was
a
matter
of
no
great
importance
to
the
hotel
which
was
full
of
other
clients
and
of
other
business
anything
that
might
have
happened
anything
of
which
the
englishman
might
be
accused
did
not
concern
the
now
that
he
was
no
longer
a
resident
of
the
hotel
and
employés
had
been
instructed
not
to
gossip
either
in
his
favour
or
disfavour
besides
a
good
deal
of
water
had
run
through
the
mill
since
his
eviction
and
the
late
lord
loveland
was
now
shelved
as
a
back
number
having
got
this
information
passed
on
from
rosenstein
isidora
had
felt
safe
in
attempting
her
bidding
her
obliging
friend
goodbye
with
thanks
she
went
herself
to
the
assuming
the
air
of
a
duchess
as
she
conceived
it
she
showed
to
a
clerk
the
paper
given
her
by
loveland
and
signed
by
him
at
the
same
time
she
mentioned
haughtily
that
she
was
a
friend
of
the
gentleman
and
had
dropped
in
for
his
mail
there
was
no
mail
had
come
the
laconic
answer
no
cablegram
no
letters
no
visiting
cards
and
nobody
had
called
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
newspaper
men
loveland
heart
was
cold
as
iron
and
as
heavy
when
isidora
story
had
reached
this
climax
difference
in
time
could
no
longer
account
for
the
london
bank
failure
in
replying
to
his
wire
of
yesterday
there
was
some
other
reason
for
silence
some
strange
sinister
reason
connected
no
doubt
with
the
attitude
of
the
new
york
cashier
hours
ago
val
asked
himself
insistently
what
that
reason
might
be
and
could
get
no
answer
although
various
disturbing
conjectures
flitted
through
his
brain
he
thought
of
the
debts
he
had
left
behind
in
london
and
wondered
if
any
of
his
creditors
could
possibly
be
responsible
for
the
mysterious
trouble
which
had
attacked
him
simultaneously
from
both
sides
of
the
world
and
nobody
had
called
or
written
this
lack
of
courtesy
showed
to
his
mind
that
jim
and
betty
friends
had
all
read
the
newspapers
and
had
taken
his
affair
with
milton
in
bad
part
the
man
milton
was
to
blame
for
the
scandal
which
had
doubtless
been
spread
by
cadwallader
hunter
journalist
friend
in
revenge
for
a
snub
cadwallader
malice
too
must
have
been
another
match
to
light
the
fire
of
mischief
and
taking
everything
together
loveland
began
to
fear
that
the
game
in
america
was
up
he
hated
to
fail
hated
to
be
thwarted
pushed
back
with
brutal
violence
from
the
very
threshold
of
success
but
it
was
all
too
sordid
too
humiliating
for
a
gentleman
to
contend
against
he
began
to
tell
himself
that
the
dignified
course
was
to
turn
his
back
on
america
and
march
homeward
with
flags
flying
as
if
he
had
suffered
no
defeat
yes
that
was
what
he
would
do
it
would
be
disgracing
himself
and
his
name
to
go
down
and
wrestle
in
the
arena
with
enemies
who
did
not
pretend
to
fight
fair
yet
to
leave
this
country
for
ever
with
no
hope
of
seeing
lesley
dearmer
again
she
had
not
even
given
him
her
address
and
had
only
laughed
elusively
when
he
suggested
calling
on
her
some
day
after
everything
was
comfortably
settled
he
knew
no
more
than
that
she
lived
near
louisville
therefore
he
could
not
write
to
beg
that
she
would
not
believe
any
hateful
tales
the
newspapers
might
invent
oh
yes
it
was
all
over
that
little
episode
which
had
been
so
sweet
which
had
taught
him
that
he
had
heart
enough
to
love
and
long
for
a
woman
because
of
what
she
was
not
because
of
what
she
had
you
need
look
so
broken
up
said
isidora
wait
till
i
come
to
the
end
of
the
story
i
got
a
messenger
waitin
in
the
street
with
something
for
you
i
would
let
him
in
till
we
had
our
talk
now
i
going
to
call
him
down
to
cheer
you
up
a
bit
she
bounced
off
her
chair
ran
to
the
door
and
shouted
up
from
the
level
of
the
basement
to
the
street
in
another
moment
a
uniformed
youth
walked
in
and
deposited
a
large
bundle
but
it
was
not
until
he
had
been
sent
away
that
isidora
began
to
open
the
parcel
i
wanted
to
get
the
lot
she
said
but
my
the
bill
was
high
way
above
me
i
dollars
i
been
savin
up
oh
for
something
but
you
need
care
i
a
heap
rather
do
this
than
buy
any
old
thing
for
myself
and
here
what
they
give
me
after
a
lot
of
fuss
she
tore
off
the
brown
paper
with
a
dramatic
gesture
and
triumphantly
displayed
the
suit
of
tweed
clothing
which
loveland
had
taken
off
the
evening
before
in
dressing
for
dinner
then
her
face
fell
as
she
saw
that
his
expressed
no
pleasure
i
thought
you
like
these
better
than
anything
as
i
could
run
to
all
the
girl
went
on
disappointedly
you
paid
my
hotel
bill
exclaimed
loveland
only
a
little
weeny
part
isidora
broke
in
wisht
i
could
have
done
more
i
do
said
val
hastily
oh
you
very
kind
too
kind
i
know
what
to
say
but
your
money
that
you
were
saving
why
i
jove
it
horrible
and
i
may
be
able
to
pay
you
back
for
days
i
do
want
you
to
pay
me
back
the
girl
said
proudly
it
been
a
pleasure
loveland
heart
reproached
him
he
had
shuddered
a
little
at
the
thought
that
this
gaudy
young
beauty
in
flaunting
feathers
and
cheap
finery
had
gone
to
the
waldorf
claiming
him
as
her
gentleman
friend
but
it
was
a
thought
far
less
palatable
that
she
should
spend
her
savings
for
him
he
was
grateful
more
grateful
than
he
would
have
known
how
to
be
yesterday
to
a
person
not
of
his
own
class
yet
gratitude
was
not
now
his
strongest
emotion
he
thanked
her
as
best
he
could
for
all
she
had
done
and
talked
down
her
objections
to
being
repaid
now
he
said
owing
to
her
kindness
he
could
walk
the
streets
without
being
stared
at
and
would
lose
no
time
in
cabling
to
his
mother
oh
he
had
plenty
of
money
for
that
and
smiling
as
if
it
were
part
of
a
huge
joke
he
showed
what
the
payment
of
his
small
debt
to
the
restaurant
had
left
of
his
eight
dollars
seven
dollars
and
a
thirty
shillings
why
he
was
rich
all
he
asked
now
was
a
room
in
which
to
change
his
clothes
as
there
was
a
houseful
of
empty
rooms
this
request
was
easily
granted
and
presently
loveland
came
back
to
the
kitchen
suitably
clad
for
daylight
except
for
the
detail
of
his
necktie
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
a
change
of
linen
but
there
was
no
use
in
crying
for
the
moon
and
isidora
saw
no
fault
in
his
appearance
as
she
walked
proudly
at
his
side
on
the
way
to
send
a
cablegram
to
scotland
secretly
loveland
would
have
been
glad
to
dispense
with
her
company
but
she
assured
him
that
she
had
more
time
than
anything
else
and
that
she
would
be
delighted
to
guide
him
only
they
must
go
past
home
for
if
pa
saw
her
with
a
strange
gentleman
there
be
trouble
isidora
peered
over
her
companion
shoulder
as
he
wrote
out
his
message
to
his
mother
and
was
much
interested
in
the
address
to
save
expense
he
put
only
loveland
dorloch
north
britain
therefore
the
girl
curiosity
was
not
greatly
rewarded
all
she
could
say
to
herself
was
that
apparently
he
had
some
right
to
the
name
of
loveland
and
that
he
really
did
seem
to
expect
that
somebody
over
there
might
send
him
a
remittance
otherwise
why
should
he
waste
good
money
on
a
cablegram
and
without
a
code
too
loveland
had
not
written
to
his
mother
since
his
change
of
plan
about
the
ships
but
after
all
he
said
to
himself
it
did
not
matter
he
was
always
a
bad
correspondent
always
had
been
and
the
mater
just
put
up
with
it
poor
dear
she
would
be
worrying
anyway
as
she
must
suppose
him
to
be
on
the
high
seas
at
this
moment
a
passenger
on
the
unless
she
had
heard
from
betty
or
jim
an
improbable
contingency
even
if
he
had
sent
off
a
letter
directly
after
landing
she
would
not
get
it
for
days
yet
so
his
negligence
had
done
no
harm
as
for
the
marconigram
jim
had
suggested
why
as
things
had
turned
out
it
was
as
well
he
had
wasted
money
on
it
unfortunately
to
make
his
need
of
money
clear
val
was
obliged
to
write
a
long
message
even
though
he
attempted
no
elaborate
explanation
beyond
saying
do
believe
newspaper
canards
when
he
had
finished
and
did
not
see
his
way
to
striking
out
a
single
word
he
was
vexed
to
find
that
he
would
have
to
pay
six
dollars
and
fifty
cents
still
his
mother
would
instantly
send
the
fifty
pounds
he
asked
for
even
if
she
had
to
borrow
and
in
a
few
hours
this
hideous
situation
would
be
ended
he
could
pay
all
he
owed
and
then
if
there
were
no
hope
of
anything
good
in
america
he
would
take
passage
on
the
first
homeward
bound
ship
isidora
advised
him
to
give
as
an
address
the
house
where
gernsbacher
was
caretaker
as
embarrassing
questions
might
be
asked
by
pa
if
an
answer
came
to
the
restaurant
she
was
afraid
that
gordon
would
have
to
chum
up
with
bill
again
for
the
night
if
he
were
determined
not
to
accept
a
little
loan
from
her
and
she
was
grieved
to
think
of
the
boring
evening
he
would
have
to
spend
it
would
be
fun
she
thought
if
he
would
just
drop
in
at
the
restaurant
like
a
stranger
and
have
some
supper
which
would
cost
him
as
little
there
as
anywhere
since
he
was
bent
on
paying
but
loveland
made
an
excuse
which
pleased
her
so
much
that
she
relinquished
the
plan
almost
without
a
pang
it
would
be
difficult
he
said
after
all
her
goodness
to
treat
her
like
an
entire
stranger
he
said
this
carelessly
but
to
her
it
meant
a
great
deal
so
much
that
she
went
straight
home
almost
as
happy
as
if
he
had
been
by
her
side
with
his
evening
clothes
under
his
arm
the
first
time
in
his
life
perhaps
that
he
had
carried
a
parcel
larger
than
a
letter
loveland
found
his
way
back
to
the
bowery
back
to
the
bat
hotel
back
to
his
friend
bill
who
was
already
in
the
reading
room
and
once
again
the
name
of
gordon
figured
humbly
among
the
hundred
and
fifty
lodgers
for
that
night
chapter
the
man
who
waits
there
came
no
cablegram
from
scotland
next
day
loveland
mother
did
not
answer
his
appeal
but
val
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
this
was
not
strange
perhaps
she
could
not
get
together
such
a
sum
as
he
had
asked
for
without
a
little
delay
but
she
would
send
as
soon
as
possible
he
was
sure
of
that
as
he
was
sure
that
his
present
address
ought
to
be
first
circle
hades
the
dollar
which
remained
to
him
after
sending
his
expensive
cry
across
the
sea
was
gone
he
borrowed
of
bill
willing
who
offered
and
was
delighted
to
lend
in
a
day
or
two
at
most
loveland
said
he
would
repay
and
planned
to
give
bill
a
handsome
present
as
well
meanwhile
loveland
passed
his
time
miserably
between
alexander
the
great
and
the
bat
hotel
or
walking
the
streets
in
the
desperate
hope
of
seeing
some
english
face
he
knew
he
saw
many
pleasant
faces
to
whom
no
appeal
of
sorrow
would
be
made
in
vain
but
they
were
strangers
faces
and
he
was
not
a
beggar
yet
he
had
bought
with
bill
money
an
advance
from
alexander
two
or
three
collars
a
change
of
linen
and
a
dark
necktie
therefore
he
looked
smart
and
prosperous
enough
in
his
tweed
suit
to
pass
muster
in
a
crowd
the
absence
of
an
overcoat
seeming
a
mere
eccentricity
perhaps
there
were
men
who
envied
the
handsome
young
englishman
who
strolled
past
them
with
a
jaunty
leisured
air
while
they
were
forced
to
hurry
but
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
the
need
of
hurry
four
days
dragged
by
including
one
ghastly
sunday
and
when
there
was
still
no
word
from
lady
loveland
val
began
to
feel
the
heavy
conviction
that
none
would
ever
come
some
awful
spell
had
fallen
upon
him
it
seemed
a
curse
which
made
him
a
pariah
even
for
those
who
loved
him
best
it
had
begun
with
foxham
treachery
and
now
it
had
come
to
his
mother
neglect
what
might
follow
he
could
not
guess
he
would
rather
not
try
to
guess
he
thought
over
his
past
and
realised
that
he
had
been
selfish
but
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
ever
done
anything
which
deserved
such
a
punishment
as
this
if
punishment
it
were
if
there
were
a
god
who
watched
the
children
of
the
earth
and
punished
or
rewarded
their
deeds
never
before
had
it
occurred
to
him
to
pity
others
beyond
a
poor
old
chap
so
sorry
do
you
know
and
a
quick
forgetting
but
now
he
was
filled
with
a
dumb
sympathy
for
everyone
who
suffered
above
this
bright
gay
city
the
gayest
and
brightest
val
had
ever
known
it
seemed
that
his
eyes
had
gained
a
magic
keenness
to
see
the
smoke
of
human
suffering
rise
like
incense
to
the
clear
remoteness
of
the
sky
loveland
did
not
always
take
his
meals
at
alexander
sometimes
he
let
a
pass
too
deeply
depressed
to
be
hungry
or
if
bill
willing
insisted
on
food
for
both
there
were
places
where
it
could
be
obtained
even
more
cheaply
than
at
alexander
the
great
when
alexander
himself
and
not
isidora
was
behind
the
counter
val
had
met
the
boss
now
though
not
officially
while
he
had
a
few
dimes
and
nickels
in
his
pocket
he
patronised
the
restaurant
glad
to
have
a
glimpse
of
isidora
friendly
pretty
face
and
a
chance
to
warm
himself
at
the
glowing
stove
the
boss
regarded
him
as
a
client
a
queer
cuss
down
on
his
luck
but
worth
being
civil
to
for
in
new
york
you
never
knew
how
men
fortunes
might
change
nevertheless
loveland
realised
that
alexander
had
as
much
real
kindness
of
heart
for
the
world
in
general
as
shylock
or
a
tiger
he
had
his
friends
perhaps
for
tigers
may
have
friends
in
their
native
jungle
if
there
be
no
question
of
a
carcass
to
divide
but
when
most
sleek
and
smiling
there
was
something
vaguely
terrible
about
the
fat
jew
wake
the
tiger
in
him
from
its
sleep
of
purring
prosperity
and
it
would
spring
tearing
and
rending
with
unsheathed
claws
the
creature
who
had
roused
it
isidora
thought
loveland
must
resemble
her
mother
who
it
appeared
was
long
ago
dead
and
maybe
that
was
one
reason
why
the
jew
loved
the
girl
so
jealously
as
a
tiger
loves
its
young
or
as
shylock
loved
jessica
she
had
something
of
his
hebraic
cast
of
feature
although
he
had
taken
a
christian
wife
but
nothing
could
be
less
like
the
with
its
fierce
glance
suddenly
unveiled
the
cruel
nose
and
the
big
rapacious
mouth
of
the
gross
elderly
man
than
the
langourous
beauty
of
the
young
girl
his
father
had
been
a
german
jew
but
he
once
isaac
solomon
now
alexander
the
great
had
been
born
in
the
slums
of
new
york
and
had
fought
his
way
up
biting
clawing
or
fawning
whichever
seemed
the
wisest
course
now
he
was
growing
rich
he
was
proud
of
his
own
portrait
on
the
walls
in
the
proud
of
the
queer
pictorial
menus
and
smart
advertising
cards
which
helped
to
make
the
success
of
the
venture
in
which
he
had
risked
his
capital
but
he
acknowledged
no
debt
of
gratitude
to
bill
willing
ingenuity
and
would
have
sacked
the
artist
the
moment
he
ceased
to
be
useful
he
decried
the
value
of
bill
work
he
bullied
his
two
black
cooks
and
his
waiters
nor
had
his
prosperity
given
him
any
fellow
feeling
for
others
who
like
himself
were
struggling
to
reach
the
top
if
you
deserved
to
get
on
you
got
on
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
was
alexander
motto
but
he
loved
and
admired
isidora
and
though
he
grumbled
when
she
asked
for
money
secretly
his
chief
joy
in
piling
up
a
fortune
was
for
her
future
that
she
might
marry
well
and
hand
his
name
on
for
posthumous
honours
he
had
already
picked
out
the
bridegroom
a
young
jew
with
goggle
eyes
a
turned
up
moustache
and
glittering
black
hair
a
fondness
for
celluloid
collars
and
red
neckties
a
smooth
manner
with
his
prospective
and
a
truculent
front
for
his
inferiors
the
young
man
was
making
good
money
as
a
drummer
for
a
firm
of
jewish
tobacco
merchants
but
there
was
a
slight
tache
upon
his
parentage
and
he
would
be
willing
to
take
alexander
name
on
marrying
alexander
daughter
when
years
from
now
alexander
might
wish
to
retire
on
his
pies
and
fried
oysters
as
other
heroes
had
retired
on
their
laurels
leo
cohen
would
with
isidora
carry
on
the
restaurant
and
its
glory
from
generation
to
generation
this
was
alexander
dream
and
woe
unto
him
who
should
try
to
interfere
with
its
fulfilment
but
he
had
no
fear
of
any
such
dangerous
person
even
when
leo
was
away
drumming
up
interest
for
a
certain
firm
in
the
west
and
a
tall
handsome
young
englishman
was
dropping
in
every
day
for
cheap
food
and
a
smile
from
isidora
if
loveland
had
had
money
he
would
have
sent
off
other
cablegrams
but
he
soon
came
down
to
his
last
copper
and
bill
though
willing
by
nature
as
by
name
seldom
had
in
his
best
days
more
to
lend
him
than
fifteen
cents
at
a
time
on
the
fifth
day
the
situation
passed
beyond
bearing
not
only
was
loveland
penniless
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
borrow
more
of
bill
pitiful
nickels
and
dimes
each
one
of
those
coins
was
more
to
bill
than
a
sovereign
usually
someone
else
sovereign
had
been
to
lord
loveland
in
his
palmy
days
the
thing
could
go
on
and
so
val
was
saying
to
bill
as
the
two
drank
hot
coffee
at
expense
standing
up
before
the
counter
at
alexander
the
great
on
the
fifth
morning
after
loveland
arrival
in
new
york
it
was
not
quite
seven
but
bill
had
finished
his
work
on
the
meenoos
and
had
invited
gordon
to
stoke
his
furnace
at
an
expenditure
of
two
cents
alexander
who
had
presided
at
a
political
ward
meeting
the
night
before
had
not
yet
come
down
to
growl
at
his
his
and
all
within
his
gates
dutchy
had
been
discharged
with
violence
the
night
before
because
he
had
drowned
his
vast
homesickness
in
unlimited
beer
and
blinkey
was
the
only
member
of
the
household
on
view
except
the
black
cook
dick
and
dick
assistant
bill
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
i
shall
have
to
work
or
steal
anything
but
borrow
more
until
i
can
touch
my
money
loveland
broke
out
when
blinkey
had
disappeared
behind
the
red
curtain
and
was
being
harangued
in
the
distance
by
big
dick
it
ai
easy
to
do
either
in
new
york
said
bill
mildly
to
think
of
my
being
practically
reduced
to
starvation
and
nakedness
with
a
letter
of
credit
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
my
pocket
groaned
val
do
you
think
old
alexander
would
advance
me
anything
if
i
told
him
my
whole
story
oh
i
guess
i
would
tell
him
the
story
bill
advised
hastily
why
not
well
he
got
a
sharp
tongue
alexander
has
in
england
such
a
fellow
could
only
get
at
me
at
all
through
my
servants
i
suppose
so
agreed
bill
gently
but
this
ai
england
i
should
think
it
was
worse
luck
you
do
have
bad
luck
said
bill
but
change
it
if
you
asked
alexander
for
a
loan
on
that
letter
of
credit
if
he
said
anything
fit
for
publication
he
only
say
if
the
bank
would
accommodate
you
he
would
and
what
the
dickens
did
you
take
him
for
when
i
want
a
quarter
before
it
due
it
like
gettin
milk
out
of
a
corkscrew
and
the
one
thing
he
thinks
of
is
whether
i
shall
get
run
over
by
an
automobile
before
i
work
out
the
money
next
morning
oh
i
know
alexander
what
pa
been
up
to
now
pertly
demanded
the
voice
of
pa
fair
daughter
isidora
had
come
in
while
the
two
were
so
deeply
occupied
in
conversation
and
the
dregs
in
their
coffee
cups
that
they
had
not
seen
her
lift
the
curtain
since
the
day
of
her
first
introduction
to
gordon
she
had
not
appeared
at
this
early
hour
of
the
morning
her
father
was
generally
at
his
post
and
when
he
was
there
isidora
was
supposed
to
exist
not
for
use
but
for
ornament
however
she
knew
that
alexander
was
now
reposing
after
last
night
eloquence
and
she
had
taken
advantage
of
his
absence
this
time
she
was
not
in
wrapper
and
curling
pins
she
had
dressed
herself
with
great
care
for
the
day
having
learned
from
the
hired
girl
that
bill
willing
swell
friend
had
come
in
with
him
what
pa
been
up
to
now
i
say
she
asked
again
before
the
startled
and
mortified
bill
could
answer
oh
nothing
replied
the
artist
apologetically
we
was
just
talkin
i
was
wondering
if
he
would
advance
me
anything
enough
to
get
back
to
england
with
on
my
letter
of
credit
loveland
frankly
explained
isidora
eyes
dilated
at
val
suggestion
of
going
back
to
england
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
facts
being
as
stated
in
the
newspapers
that
he
would
wish
to
return
to
his
own
country
and
as
fortunately
after
the
first
sensational
paragraphs
his
affairs
had
been
crowded
out
of
public
interest
by
various
startling
events
of
far
greater
importance
she
had
thought
that
he
would
be
thankful
to
worry
along
as
he
was
get
back
to
england
she
echoed
blankly
it
seems
the
one
thing
to
do
now
if
i
were
kept
here
by
the
lack
of
a
few
wretched
sovereigns
said
loveland
if
your
father
would
trust
me
oh
he
would
isidora
hastened
to
put
that
idea
out
of
mind
once
and
for
ever
he
never
trusted
anybody
yet
and
he
begin
with
you
why
he
says
his
success
in
life
comes
from
never
believin
anybody
but
himself
if
a
man
tells
him
it
a
nice
day
he
goes
to
the
window
and
peeks
out
before
takin
a
walk
without
his
umbrella
and
he
think
was
like
takin
a
walk
in
his
best
clothes
when
it
rained
cats
and
dogs
to
lend
a
furriner
money
on
a
letter
of
credit
pa
perfectly
despises
that
word
loveland
gave
up
hope
of
winning
confidence
and
obtaining
dollars
from
alexander
the
great
this
state
of
things
is
enough
to
make
a
man
blow
his
brains
out
he
exclaimed
i
guess
you
need
your
brains
now
more
than
you
ever
did
suggested
bill
and
you
could
git
put
back
where
they
belonged
if
everything
come
right
directly
they
was
out
what
i
think
of
when
them
ideas
get
to
workin
in
my
head
is
the
awful
long
time
you
have
to
dead
whether
you
suited
or
not
it
a
lot
easier
to
pawn
your
dress
clothes
and
see
what
turns
up
before
loveland
could
answer
isidora
clapped
her
pretty
hands
which
were
much
cleaner
than
usual
since
gordon
had
come
into
her
daily
life
do
pawn
she
cried
that
made
me
think
of
something
always
talkin
about
visible
assets
or
somethin
like
that
well
your
dress
suit
might
be
a
visible
asset
if
if
you
really
sick
of
life
when
you
ca
pay
your
way
but
are
you
dead
sure
you
are
sick
of
it
dead
sure
echoed
loveland
what
have
you
thought
of
for
me
to
do
you
wo
be
mad
if
i
tell
you
what
nonsense
am
i
in
a
position
to
be
in
the
sense
you
mean
though
it
a
wonder
i
not
mad
in
another
sense
i
sweep
crossings
if
i
could
get
the
job
or
break
stones
if
anyone
wanted
them
broken
but
i
suppose
you
not
going
to
suggest
one
of
these
employments
as
evening
clothes
would
be
suitable
to
either
i
was
thinking
said
isidora
that
i
might
tease
pa
to
take
you
in
in
dutchy
place
if
you
care
about
it
good
heavens
be
a
waiter
stammered
loveland
he
had
felt
ready
for
any
ignominious
if
paying
work
when
in
the
abstract
but
as
soon
as
it
took
definite
form
and
such
a
form
as
this
oh
i
knew
you
be
cross
isidora
pouted
loveland
was
silent
and
as
his
dark
eyebrows
so
like
his
cousin
betty
were
drawn
together
in
a
frown
the
girl
supposed
that
he
was
sulking
i
only
thought
it
be
better
than
nothing
she
explained
hurriedly
if
pa
let
you
but
perhaps
he
would
he
think
he
was
doin
a
favour
see
he
would
understand
how
you
felt
about
it
i
have
to
explain
you
was
embarrassed
and
my
what
a
howling
swell
of
a
waiter
you
look
you
get
two
dollars
fifty
a
week
to
begin
and
your
food
that
what
dutchy
did
and
now
and
then
folks
give
a
nickel
to
the
waiter
even
in
a
place
like
this
which
i
suppose
you
turn
your
nose
up
at
after
the
but
i
sha
say
any
more
you
need
be
afraid
i
beg
your
pardon
said
loveland
if
your
father
take
me
i
do
it
when
he
comes
oh
you
must
ask
him
yourself
you
spoil
the
whole
thing
isidora
broke
in
you
must
let
me
get
at
him
two
or
three
raw
germans
and
swedes
are
bein
sent
round
this
mornin
to
look
at
but
while
dressin
i
talk
you
up
and
you
can
be
on
hand
when
he
gets
downstairs
i
go
this
minute
and
blinkey
can
see
to
anybody
that
comes
in
you
call
him
bill
she
darted
off
all
excitement
and
loveland
sat
waiting
for
the
great
man
verdict
feeling
as
if
he
had
laid
down
his
soul
for
sale
with
the
and
pork
and
beans
bill
tried
to
cheer
him
he
would
have
practically
no
expenses
and
being
such
a
good
looker
would
be
sure
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
nickels
and
even
dimes
why
he
might
save
three
dollars
a
week
and
as
for
that
trifling
debt
to
him
bill
they
would
wipe
it
off
the
slate
and
consider
it
paid
or
if
gordon
would
consent
to
do
that
he
might
send
the
money
from
england
when
he
got
home
if
he
really
did
think
it
best
to
go
home
at
three
dollars
a
week
it
would
be
long
before
a
chap
could
lay
up
enough
to
cross
in
the
steerage
the
way
those
big
ships
were
fighting
each
other
for
rates
for
fifteen
dollars
you
could
do
it
on
some
boats
and
at
three
dollars
a
week
but
before
bill
could
finish
his
calculation
a
rather
intricate
one
for
him
isidora
had
flown
in
her
cheeks
as
red
as
her
blouse
pa
in
one
of
his
funny
moods
she
whispered
wo
give
me
any
satisfaction
but
i
know
he
take
you
if
you
let
me
tell
him
who
you
are
i
mean
if
you
willing
i
say
you
the
man
all
that
stuff
was
in
the
papers
about
how
you
was
at
the
waldorf
as
the
markis
of
loveland
and
how
it
was
you
knocked
that
swell
milton
down
nobody
appreciates
the
value
of
advertising
better
than
pa
bill
can
tell
you
that
and
amatoor
or
no
amatoor
you
can
be
gettin
not
only
your
a
week
but
twice
that
and
maybe
more
out
of
alexander
the
great
i
rather
starve
or
drown
myself
said
loveland
turning
red
and
then
white
it
nasty
starving
ventured
bill
and
folks
are
that
interfering
they
always
fishing
you
out
of
the
water
and
puttin
you
into
the
newspapers
as
a
case
besides
what
the
odds
if
you
got
any
swagger
friends
they
ai
likely
to
come
nosin
round
here
alexander
is
but
it
ai
swell
loveland
had
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
steerage
when
bill
suggested
it
a
few
moments
ago
but
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
horrors
of
the
middle
passage
would
be
heaven
to
the
humiliations
he
endured
for
fifteen
dollars
bill
said
he
could
get
back
to
england
if
alexander
would
give
him
five
dollars
a
week
in
three
weeks
he
could
be
off
or
say
four
having
paid
bill
what
he
owed
but
no
that
was
an
eternity
not
to
be
endured
at
bay
and
desperate
val
determined
to
strike
high
tell
your
father
who
i
am
then
he
exclaimed
but
say
he
ca
have
me
for
any
beggarly
or
even
five
dollars
a
week
i
have
ten
or
nothing
isidora
looked
at
him
with
respect
and
dashed
away
behind
the
curtain
neither
man
spoke
the
sound
of
her
little
slippers
clicking
on
the
uncarpeted
stairs
was
sharp
in
their
ears
in
three
minutes
before
loveland
had
had
time
to
repent
she
was
down
again
pa
says
she
panted
he
going
to
use
you
for
all
worth
i
bet
he
will
murmured
bill
but
neither
he
nor
loveland
guessed
in
what
way
alexander
the
great
meant
to
make
the
swell
waiter
worth
his
wage
chapter
news
from
the
great
world
lesley
was
loveland
the
name
of
that
lord
you
knew
on
the
boat
asked
lesley
aunt
barbara
peering
at
her
niece
from
behind
an
immense
newspaper
which
hid
all
the
upper
part
of
her
body
as
if
with
a
screen
lesley
was
curled
up
on
a
sofa
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
which
had
for
some
reason
or
other
more
or
less
appropriate
been
called
the
library
for
several
generations
the
girl
was
writing
a
story
which
was
promised
for
a
certain
time
but
her
heart
was
not
in
her
work
and
she
welcomed
interruptions
instead
of
discouraging
them
as
usual
if
it
had
been
her
habit
to
shut
herself
up
alone
for
several
hours
a
day
or
if
she
had
sat
bolt
upright
at
a
desk
loveland
would
have
taken
lesley
work
more
seriously
but
when
a
pretty
girl
looking
scarcely
more
than
a
child
a
girl
you
have
seen
grow
up
from
babyhood
nestles
cosily
in
a
bank
of
ruffly
silk
cushions
with
a
frivolous
scribbling
pad
on
her
knee
and
a
pencil
in
her
hand
how
can
one
realise
that
she
is
gravely
pursuing
literature
as
a
profession
and
must
not
be
addressed
even
if
one
has
the
most
exciting
things
to
say
lesley
did
not
answer
at
first
for
she
was
composing
her
voice
that
aunt
barbara
might
not
guess
she
had
been
taken
by
surprise
therefore
loveland
asked
the
same
question
over
again
in
a
louder
tone
yes
said
lesley
do
you
remember
my
telling
you
his
name
was
the
same
as
yours
there
i
thought
so
exclaimed
the
little
dovelike
lady
only
i
was
quite
sure
whether
you
said
the
name
was
exactly
the
same
or
like
mine
you
did
talk
as
if
you
took
much
interest
in
him
and
it
seemed
as
though
you
would
if
we
been
namesakes
i
do
think
you
spoke
of
him
more
than
once
did
you
i
do
remember
i
sure
replied
lesley
beginning
to
scrawl
the
name
of
loveland
aimlessly
across
the
top
of
the
page
which
ought
by
this
time
to
have
been
covered
with
brilliant
conversation
between
her
hero
and
heroine
she
answered
in
an
indifferent
tone
almost
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
something
else
but
if
her
mind
had
indeed
been
properly
bent
on
the
story
she
would
have
said
auntie
darling
i
a
thousand
miles
away
please
with
dick
and
susanne
do
bring
me
back
there
a
dear
well
i
glad
you
did
take
much
interest
in
him
went
on
loveland
in
a
tone
pregnant
with
mystery
and
importance
i
know
i
ought
to
be
talking
to
you
when
you
at
work
and
i
do
often
do
i
not
often
smiled
lesley
her
dimples
softening
the
gentle
little
reproach
if
it
were
a
reproach
but
she
did
look
up
at
her
aunt
she
pretended
to
be
writing
on
and
so
she
was
but
it
was
only
one
word
over
and
over
again
that
she
wrote
loveland
loveland
and
her
heart
had
begun
to
beat
in
a
hurried
warning
way
as
often
it
had
on
shipboard
when
she
heard
loveland
voice
and
wondered
if
he
were
coming
to
talk
to
her
or
to
some
other
girl
but
this
is
something
really
very
special
aunt
barbara
apologised
it
quite
exciting
only
fancy
having
known
him
i
almost
wish
pointed
him
out
to
me
that
last
morning
on
board
when
i
was
up
on
deck
it
would
be
interesting
to
remember
what
he
was
like
is
there
something
about
him
in
the
paper
asked
lesley
who
had
been
expecting
news
but
would
have
preferred
to
read
it
herself
if
she
could
have
chosen
i
should
think
there
was
exclaimed
her
aunt
screened
behind
the
great
printed
sheets
again
is
he
engaged
already
lesley
enquired
making
a
sketch
of
lord
loveland
profile
in
the
midst
of
a
speech
of
dick
though
dick
was
a
very
different
sort
of
young
man
from
loveland
a
very
different
sort
indeed
how
many
times
she
had
caught
herself
tracing
the
outline
of
those
features
so
clear
so
straight
so
perfect
an
outline
that
it
was
as
easy
to
draw
as
to
copy
a
greek
statue
she
knew
every
line
and
often
the
little
was
there
before
her
eyes
on
the
paper
before
she
knew
what
she
had
been
doing
she
was
almost
perfectly
certain
what
aunt
barbara
answer
to
her
question
would
be
of
course
he
was
engaged
he
had
hardly
had
time
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
any
new
girls
in
new
york
and
propose
marriage
so
it
must
be
elinor
coolidge
or
fanny
milton
engaged
echoed
the
elder
no
indeed
what
a
mercy
he
been
found
out
before
some
nice
girl
was
mixed
up
in
the
scandal
of
course
he
wanted
a
scandal
now
at
last
lesley
did
lift
her
head
quickly
and
the
last
looked
as
if
it
had
been
struck
by
lightning
shocking
answered
loveland
what
a
dreadful
thing
that
our
country
should
be
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
gold
mine
by
these
foreign
birds
of
prey
lesley
little
ears
burned
pink
as
if
her
aunt
had
boxed
them
her
eyes
sent
out
a
spark
but
its
fire
was
quenched
in
a
sudden
trickle
of
nervous
laughter
dear
aunt
barb
would
of
prey
make
successful
miners
aunt
barbara
laughed
too
you
always
catching
me
up
for
my
similes
she
said
but
luckily
i
do
write
stories
so
it
matter
and
anyway
that
what
they
birds
of
prey
as
for
what
they
do
they
marry
our
girls
who
find
them
out
too
late
and
then
try
to
get
divorces
what
an
escape
for
some
poor
little
heiress
that
this
creature
is
hoist
with
his
own
petard
in
the
very
midst
of
baiting
his
wicked
trap
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
child
i
do
care
mixed
up
i
am
did
this
man
look
like
a
gentleman
yes
said
lesley
naturally
because
he
is
a
gentleman
my
dear
he
must
have
been
clever
to
hoodwink
an
observant
little
thing
like
you
who
can
see
right
down
into
people
hearts
even
when
you
hardly
seem
to
be
noticing
how
they
do
their
hair
or
the
colour
of
their
neckties
this
man
is
nothing
but
his
own
valet
so
am
i
my
own
maid
said
lesley
he
never
said
he
was
rich
or
i
mean
he
is
a
marquis
the
soft
outline
of
the
girl
figure
stiffened
and
she
sat
up
very
straight
on
the
sofa
who
says
he
is
a
marquis
she
asked
sharply
everybody
the
newspaper
oh
the
newspaper
but
it
true
he
been
turned
out
of
his
hotel
i
read
you
the
please
i
think
i
read
it
myself
if
you
do
mind
dear
said
lesley
that
is
when
you
finished
i
can
wait
i
have
finished
all
i
care
about
reading
loveland
hastened
to
assure
her
for
she
invariably
discovered
that
she
has
ceased
to
want
anything
which
lesley
could
even
be
suspected
of
wishing
for
take
the
paper
dear
do
get
up
i
bring
it
to
you
but
lesley
did
get
up
and
stood
with
her
back
to
her
aunt
as
she
read
the
louisville
version
of
tony
kidd
sensational
story
she
took
a
long
time
to
read
it
and
when
she
had
come
to
the
end
she
laid
the
paper
on
her
aunt
lap
without
saying
a
word
well
has
it
struck
you
dumb
exclaimed
loveland
disappointed
for
if
she
spoiled
lesley
with
petting
lesley
spoiled
her
with
responsiveness
i
am
rather
horrified
said
the
girl
no
wonder
you
actually
knew
him
or
thought
you
did
i
think
so
still
why
did
you
suspect
at
all
nothing
that
i
do
suspect
now
poor
fellow
dearest
that
carrying
too
far
think
if
he
married
some
girl
i
have
often
thought
of
it
what
must
milton
and
fanny
be
feeling
went
on
loveland
friends
on
the
ship
and
now
he
knocks
down
the
husband
and
father
in
the
street
because
ah
yes
because
of
what
echoed
lesley
milton
says
i
read
what
he
said
but
his
photograph
is
in
the
paper
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
nothing
unless
one
interested
in
physiognomy
i
do
know
anything
about
physiognomy
said
loveland
neither
do
i
said
lesley
except
what
i
was
born
knowing
well
dear
i
do
think
i
talk
to
any
of
our
friends
about
having
met
this
dreadful
impostor
aunt
barbara
suggested
gently
people
might
fancy
if
you
did
that
there
been
oh
some
little
shipboard
flirtation
perhaps
nothing
serious
of
course
but
so
they
might
admitted
the
girl
i
did
think
at
the
time
myself
that
it
was
anything
serious
i
should
hope
not
breathed
aunt
barbara
a
valet
marquis
or
valet
murmured
lesley
with
a
quaint
little
smile
it
sounds
like
the
title
of
an
story
for
goodness
sake
do
use
it
begged
her
aunt
the
material
worthy
of
you
oh
my
stories
are
always
said
lesley
you
know
the
critics
reproach
me
for
running
ahead
of
the
times
in
my
ideas
you
certainly
are
rather
unexpected
replied
loveland
sometimes
i
almost
wish
you
were
a
tiny
just
a
tiny
bit
more
conventional
you
wished
it
when
i
said
fellow
oh
but
you
did
really
mean
that
i
did
persisted
lesley
i
should
be
disappointed
in
myself
if
i
thought
i
could
fail
to
recognise
a
valet
when
i
saw
one
and
i
hate
being
disappointed
in
anyone
it
be
disappointing
to
an
author
one
who
has
to
be
a
student
of
character
assented
aunt
barbara
soothingly
even
when
she
forgotten
all
about
that
part
of
herself
for
awhile
owing
to
interruptions
the
dovelike
little
lady
looked
hurt
oh
my
dear
i
do
beg
your
pardon
she
cried
of
course
i
know
at
this
time
of
day
i
only
in
the
library
on
sufferance
i
did
mean
you
auntie
said
lesley
kissing
her
not
me
who
then
but
i
really
ought
to
write
i
do
hope
i
have
taken
your
inspiration
away
dearest
no
you
given
me
one
i
so
glad
well
i
run
away
now
i
lots
of
things
to
see
to
forget
all
about
the
marquis
of
loveland
i
mean
the
valet
put
him
out
of
your
mind
do
worry
auntie
it
quite
easy
to
put
a
valet
out
of
a
tidy
little
mind
like
mine
think
of
dick
said
loveland
he
going
to
be
a
splendid
fellow
dick
a
paper
doll
said
lesley
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
not
in
a
mood
to
play
dolls
that
when
aunt
barbara
was
gone
lesley
did
not
go
back
to
her
sofa
and
her
story
writing
she
picked
up
the
paper
which
loveland
had
left
lying
on
the
table
but
she
did
not
read
she
merely
looked
at
photograph
then
she
went
to
the
desk
where
she
kept
papers
and
took
a
from
a
drawer
no
that
wo
do
she
said
to
herself
after
thinking
for
a
minute
she
put
the
back
in
its
place
and
opened
another
drawer
not
locked
for
neither
drawers
nor
cupboards
nor
hearts
were
ever
locked
in
this
kentucky
house
the
second
drawer
was
full
of
greenbacks
perhaps
it
was
a
kind
of
savings
bank
for
the
young
author
but
poor
or
rich
authors
are
proverbially
easy
about
parting
with
their
earnings
and
lesley
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
she
counted
out
a
number
of
bills
more
than
half
folded
them
up
in
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
torn
off
the
writing
pad
that
there
might
be
no
address
upon
it
and
pressed
the
flattened
parcel
into
a
large
stout
envelope
this
she
sealed
with
blue
sealing
wax
and
after
a
moment
or
two
of
puzzled
reflection
began
to
print
in
big
black
letters
the
marquis
of
loveland
hotel
new
york
to
be
sent
immediately
to
present
address
chapter
the
marquis
of
twelfth
street
it
was
isidora
who
found
out
first
what
was
in
her
father
mind
because
she
saw
the
advertisement
which
alexander
the
great
had
written
for
the
papers
it
lay
on
the
parlour
table
in
clear
black
and
white
for
any
eye
to
read
when
isidora
came
to
clear
away
the
litter
of
odds
and
ends
that
emmie
the
hired
girl
might
lay
the
dinner
things
oh
pa
she
gasped
is
what
you
going
to
do
of
course
said
alexander
the
great
staring
at
her
over
his
spectacles
as
he
wiped
his
pen
and
pushed
his
chair
from
the
table
tell
that
gel
to
hurry
up
do
she
know
by
dis
dat
i
got
just
twenty
minutes
for
dinner
i
have
to
go
before
dessert
if
she
get
busy
you
want
to
change
the
subject
pa
said
isidora
no
i
do
why
for
your
business
was
me
had
the
idea
he
wo
stand
bein
advertised
pooh
said
alexander
i
tell
you
he
wo
he
quit
he
afraid
the
police
are
onto
him
anyhow
milton
ai
lodged
no
complaint
nobody
has
or
i
have
kicked
de
feller
out
first
thing
when
you
tol
me
who
he
was
nobody
ai
to
touch
him
and
nobody
ai
goin
to
keep
him
when
he
sees
added
isidora
pointing
to
the
paragraph
written
in
alexander
the
clearest
handwriting
he
need
see
it
unless
you
blab
silly
gel
said
her
father
what
for
should
he
read
newspaper
advertisements
i
guess
he
got
else
to
do
somebody
tell
him
people
come
here
to
eat
not
talk
anyhow
dis
goes
and
it
went
it
went
to
several
papers
and
though
alexander
the
great
paid
only
for
the
insertion
of
small
paragraphs
in
the
columns
of
the
journals
he
chuckled
to
himself
in
anticipation
of
receiving
far
more
valuable
advertisements
gratis
nor
was
he
wrong
in
matters
of
business
within
the
scope
of
his
capabilities
alexander
was
seldom
wrong
that
was
why
he
was
great
true
it
might
be
that
lord
loveland
of
the
as
tony
kidd
had
dubbed
him
was
a
back
number
and
had
been
superseded
in
public
esteem
by
at
least
two
promising
murderers
and
one
lively
divorcée
nevertheless
even
small
crimes
were
thankfully
received
by
newspaper
men
and
women
as
alexander
had
reason
to
know
did
he
not
owe
part
of
his
present
success
to
a
dearth
of
just
about
the
time
when
bill
willing
had
begun
to
decorate
the
walls
of
the
new
red
restaurant
in
twelfth
street
alexander
had
spent
a
little
money
then
in
sprinkling
a
few
paragraphs
over
dull
columns
that
set
forth
the
advantages
of
pale
pills
or
bath
chairs
reporters
on
the
prowl
had
happened
to
read
happened
to
laugh
and
eventually
happened
to
pass
through
twelfth
street
so
now
alexander
hoped
again
for
something
to
happen
and
did
not
hope
in
vain
journalists
were
not
needing
at
this
season
which
was
rosy
with
debutantes
pearly
with
brides
and
sparkling
with
balls
and
dinner
parties
as
well
as
lurid
with
exciting
murders
but
tony
kidd
enterprising
eye
lit
on
alexander
inspiration
while
it
was
still
as
fresh
as
tomorrow
bread
in
the
issue
of
new
york
light
which
was
in
the
making
he
considered
loveland
still
his
own
though
tony
had
passed
on
to
better
scoops
since
the
night
when
he
had
changed
his
first
sketchy
impressions
of
the
difficult
young
man
to
approach
into
a
story
far
more
entertaining
he
was
greatly
amused
at
the
latest
development
of
loveland
and
thought
that
even
a
preoccupied
public
would
be
amused
too
especially
as
alexander
own
paragraph
was
quaintly
quotable
lost
at
the
hotel
the
marquis
of
loveland
found
ditto
at
alexander
the
great
in
twelfth
street
if
you
want
to
be
served
by
a
lord
dine
at
alexander
for
marquis
included
you
eat
your
dinner
waiter
loveland
does
the
rest
tony
was
very
busy
just
then
having
an
important
errand
out
of
town
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
but
he
secretly
commissioned
an
understudy
to
be
at
alexander
when
the
red
restaurant
should
open
its
doors
to
order
breakfast
and
while
seeming
to
eat
to
sketch
the
new
english
waiter
the
understudy
was
not
to
question
loveland
himself
but
if
possible
alexander
and
was
not
to
let
the
waiter
see
that
he
was
under
fire
of
attention
notes
of
loveland
appearance
as
well
as
a
drawing
must
be
made
for
kidd
benefit
because
the
sharp
young
journalist
was
not
going
to
let
himself
be
spoofed
it
was
quite
on
the
cards
that
some
other
enterprising
person
might
have
taken
a
fancy
to
call
himself
a
marquis
in
order
to
attract
customers
to
alexander
and
if
so
tony
little
story
would
have
to
differ
slightly
from
the
original
design
when
he
came
back
from
the
country
late
in
the
afternoon
however
kidd
at
once
recognised
the
cleverly
executed
sketch
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
young
man
who
had
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
at
the
was
now
pie
slinger
in
a
cheap
downtown
restaurant
tony
questioned
his
understudy
as
to
what
he
had
found
out
and
learned
that
alexander
himself
had
been
privately
interviewed
the
great
man
had
discouraged
the
from
talking
with
the
marquis
who
it
seemed
was
ignorant
that
he
had
begun
to
figure
again
in
the
newspapers
the
fellow
had
been
starving
said
alexander
and
permitted
the
use
of
his
name
to
a
limited
extent
but
might
kick
if
he
heard
of
the
advertisements
alexander
wished
him
to
kind
of
get
used
to
things
before
people
noticed
him
much
for
he
was
a
queer
fish
inclined
to
hold
onto
the
ragged
edges
of
dignity
in
spite
of
his
fall
the
idea
was
to
let
it
leak
out
very
gradually
that
lord
loveland
was
being
worked
to
draw
a
crowd
and
thus
admonished
tony
understudy
had
let
the
new
waiter
alone
tony
kidd
himself
however
only
laughed
because
he
understood
alexander
little
ways
and
guessed
how
he
expected
to
get
his
worth
out
of
the
newspapers
the
journalist
wrote
his
story
which
he
fancied
exceedingly
and
his
editor
was
pleased
with
it
too
although
it
was
sure
to
give
alexander
a
tremendous
free
boom
next
morning
there
was
half
a
column
on
a
good
page
of
light
including
space
for
the
understudy
line
portrait
of
a
tall
young
man
in
evening
dress
with
a
coffee
pot
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other
and
even
the
printers
grinned
at
the
heading
the
marquis
of
twelfth
street
newly
acquired
title
chapter
through
the
telephone
a
persistent
ringing
of
the
telephone
in
fanny
milton
bedroom
waked
her
out
of
a
delightful
dream
she
was
on
shipboard
again
it
was
moonlight
and
lord
loveland
was
telling
her
that
he
really
cared
a
great
deal
more
for
her
than
for
lesley
dearmer
she
confessed
that
she
liked
him
too
and
he
was
just
asking
her
to
come
and
reign
over
loveland
castle
as
well
as
his
heart
when
the
distant
though
disturbing
notes
of
an
amateur
concert
in
the
music
room
of
the
turned
definitely
into
the
shrill
bur
r
of
that
wretched
telephone
the
dream
broke
like
a
rainbow
bubble
and
fanny
sat
up
in
bed
disappointed
with
life
it
was
past
ten
but
she
had
been
at
a
ball
the
night
before
and
had
not
meant
to
wake
till
eleven
after
the
dream
realities
seemed
flat
and
unprofitable
for
a
minute
and
she
was
angry
with
the
telephone
so
angry
that
she
was
tempted
to
spite
it
by
turning
over
and
trying
to
sleep
again
but
the
hateful
thing
went
on
bumbling
like
a
distracted
bee
and
after
all
the
simplest
way
to
get
rid
of
the
pest
was
to
see
what
it
wanted
fanny
got
up
looking
like
a
cross
pretty
child
of
twelve
with
her
hanging
hair
and
the
delicate
fluffy
nightgown
in
which
she
was
not
cold
because
the
temperature
of
her
room
would
have
been
considered
warm
for
summer
she
seated
herself
by
the
telephone
and
snatched
up
the
receiver
as
if
she
were
going
to
shake
it
but
she
soon
settled
down
to
an
absorbing
interest
in
the
give
and
take
of
conversation
with
the
instrument
hello
she
said
who
are
you
oh
elinor
coolidge
what
i
was
in
bed
you
waked
me
up
never
mind
it
does
matter
yes
it
was
a
nice
enough
ball
were
you
oh
at
vanderpot
how
swagger
no
we
were
invited
i
did
care
but
mamma
was
mad
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
mamma
since
we
got
back
she
got
a
on
her
shoulder
for
nearly
everyone
no
of
course
we
have
seen
the
paper
i
just
told
you
you
waked
me
up
what
lord
love
oh
do
call
him
it
sounds
so
cruel
i
shall
never
forget
his
face
at
the
wal
why
elinor
coolidge
you
do
mean
it
waiting
in
a
cheap
restaurant
i
do
believe
it
true
in
the
paper
well
there
nothing
in
i
know
a
newspaper
man
myself
what
oh
his
name
tony
kidd
he
great
fun
he
says
he
lies
all
night
thinking
of
lies
for
all
day
says
a
pressman
must
lie
all
in
all
or
not
at
all
if
it
his
paper
yes
oh
then
it
sure
to
be
a
joke
no
i
would
not
like
to
go
and
find
out
for
myself
it
was
bad
enough
at
the
waldorf
that
night
it
just
about
gave
me
nervous
prostration
and
i
did
see
how
you
could
take
it
so
coolly
as
you
did
or
mamma
either
no
she
likes
you
she
has
a
good
word
for
him
now
says
she
suspected
from
the
first
and
was
always
trying
to
pump
him
and
find
out
things
oh
that
horrid
affair
about
him
and
papa
i
do
think
she
cares
much
she
says
papa
ought
to
have
spoken
to
him
and
then
it
would
have
happened
yes
papa
went
off
to
old
point
with
that
sneery
mason
mamma
detests
so
it
was
the
very
next
day
i
believe
who
says
papa
back
in
new
york
well
if
he
is
he
must
be
going
to
surprise
mamma
and
me
we
have
seen
him
yet
oh
elinor
i
think
it
would
be
to
make
up
a
party
and
go
to
that
restaurant
yes
i
like
slumming
and
seeing
bohemian
places
pretty
well
at
least
i
think
i
do
i
have
done
much
yet
mamma
has
but
she
hardly
ever
took
me
out
with
her
anywhere
you
know
till
we
went
to
europe
yes
in
paris
but
here
it
different
well
i
do
believe
we
find
him
there
if
we
went
but
all
the
same
i
do
want
to
why
i
ca
help
it
if
you
ask
mamma
to
chaperon
a
party
wo
go
nothing
will
make
me
i
ca
answer
for
her
i
do
know
whether
she
engaged
this
evening
or
not
she
has
been
going
out
so
very
much
since
we
came
home
oh
yes
sure
not
to
have
left
the
house
yet
she
never
out
till
eleven
who
the
comte
de
rocheverte
i
met
him
at
the
ball
last
night
what
he
was
at
vanderpot
dinner
first
took
you
in
yes
he
did
speak
to
me
of
you
when
i
danced
with
him
oh
it
was
only
one
waltz
but
i
tore
my
frock
so
we
sat
out
the
last
part
i
ca
dance
with
frenchmen
they
hop
so
and
twirl
you
about
it
was
only
that
he
asked
me
if
i
knew
you
of
course
he
said
he
thought
you
beautiful
everyone
thinks
so
he
told
me
he
met
you
at
major
cadwallader
hunter
lunch
at
sherry
two
days
after
we
got
home
no
the
major
did
ask
us
mamma
says
he
turned
the
cold
shoulder
to
her
lately
i
do
know
why
yes
the
count
rather
as
handsome
as
oh
nothing
to
compare
you
he
is
pooh
i
do
think
so
much
of
french
titles
as
all
that
i
suppose
people
will
be
nice
to
him
yes
quite
good
enough
for
a
flirtation
but
you
welcome
to
your
old
comte
it
no
inducement
to
if
he
joins
the
party
it
may
be
to
mamma
you
can
ask
her
well
i
think
it
would
be
jolly
bad
form
of
you
all
to
go
to
such
a
place
and
stare
at
him
if
it
could
be
true
that
he
yes
perhaps
bad
form
was
an
expression
of
his
i
do
care
if
it
was
oh
i
suppose
all
the
horrid
things
about
him
must
be
true
because
the
news
would
have
come
the
way
it
did
if
they
were
but
i
like
him
and
i
wo
say
i
did
now
just
because
he
down
in
the
world
lucky
not
to
go
to
prison
why
he
did
defraud
anybody
exactly
he
came
over
here
to
well
perhaps
he
did
but
he
did
do
it
anyhow
i
do
believe
he
stayed
in
new
york
after
what
happened
everyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
said
he
probably
slipped
out
of
town
that
same
night
for
fear
of
trouble
why
abroad
somewhere
i
should
think
i
would
if
i
had
been
in
his
place
not
money
enough
to
go
away
anywhere
oh
he
must
have
had
some
how
too
awful
if
it
should
be
true
no
i
would
see
him
again
for
anything
not
if
you
give
me
your
diamond
to
do
it
i
think
if
you
and
mamma
and
your
comte
de
rocheverte
go
you
be
just
like
ancient
romans
watching
the
martyrs
eaten
up
by
lions
not
much
like
a
christian
martyr
well
no
perhaps
not
like
going
to
see
gladiators
fight
and
kill
each
other
then
elinor
coolidge
hearing
you
talk
that
way
makes
me
just
see
how
you
look
dressed
like
a
roman
lady
sitting
on
a
marble
seat
beside
nero
or
some
other
wicked
old
horror
and
putting
your
thumb
down
when
it
meant
a
man
death
yes
you
would
i
believe
you
were
a
roman
woman
in
another
state
of
existence
i
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
you
can
ring
up
mamma
if
you
like
goodbye
down
went
the
receiver
and
back
scrambled
little
fanny
milton
into
her
bed
shivering
not
with
cold
but
with
emotion
her
telephone
was
silent
at
last
but
she
could
not
find
her
way
into
the
dream
again
the
door
of
that
dream
was
shut
forever
and
fanny
was
not
jealous
even
of
lesley
dearmer
now
i
wonder
if
she
knows
if
he
ever
wrote
to
her
they
were
such
friends
the
girl
said
to
herself
with
the
cover
pulled
up
to
her
small
chin
and
the
big
eyes
that
had
overflowed
for
loveland
staring
through
the
pink
twilight
of
her
curtained
room
what
if
it
true
about
that
restaurant
if
he
were
starving
after
all
it
was
no
use
to
try
and
sleep
again
fanny
rang
for
the
prim
maid
her
mother
had
imported
for
her
from
england
and
demanded
the
tea
and
toast
which
that
maid
said
all
english
ladies
took
on
waking
then
as
if
on
a
second
thought
she
added
oh
you
may
bring
me
the
morning
paper
it
must
be
new
york
light
if
it
is
in
the
house
please
tell
them
to
send
out
for
it
but
it
was
in
the
house
milton
had
been
absorbing
light
with
her
tea
and
toast
and
when
her
telephone
bell
rang
for
the
unfolding
of
miss
coolidge
amusing
plan
she
said
she
would
have
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
chaperoning
a
slumming
party
to
alexander
the
great
she
had
an
engagement
for
the
evening
but
she
would
break
it
in
order
to
go
she
quite
understood
that
elinor
did
not
care
to
mention
the
expedition
to
coolidge
men
had
such
funny
ideas
about
things
and
he
might
approve
but
it
would
be
all
right
if
he
did
know
and
a
great
lark
elinor
was
to
ask
the
comte
de
rocheverte
of
course
and
tell
him
that
milton
had
consented
to
be
the
chaperon
chapter
alexander
busy
day
elinor
coolidge
first
thought
after
reading
tony
kidd
very
entertaining
story
in
new
york
light
went
no
further
than
the
fun
of
paying
a
visit
to
alexander
the
great
and
being
waited
upon
by
the
man
whose
supercilious
airs
on
the
had
made
her
feel
ready
to
burst
with
spontaneous
combustion
she
had
hurried
to
telephone
fanny
milton
because
a
chaperon
was
necessary
and
fanny
mother
was
one
of
the
few
women
she
knew
who
would
not
care
whether
consent
had
been
asked
or
not
then
she
had
thought
that
it
would
be
nice
to
go
with
some
particularly
and
distinguished
young
man
whose
presence
with
her
would
prick
the
unfortunate
englishman
to
jealousy
and
give
him
the
sensations
of
an
outcast
dog
who
sees
another
animal
pampered
with
choice
morsels
and
collared
with
gold
when
milton
consented
to
be
the
chaperon
it
no
longer
mattered
to
elinor
that
fanny
refused
to
join
the
party
fanny
was
a
silly
sentimental
child
anyway
thought
miss
coolidge
who
had
asked
the
girl
only
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
the
mother
but
having
got
so
far
elinor
plan
began
to
grow
and
take
ambitious
form
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
be
dramatic
to
collect
the
whole
circle
of
girls
excepting
little
fanny
to
whom
lord
loveland
had
been
attentive
on
board
the
each
girl
must
if
possible
bring
a
man
elinor
naturally
picking
out
the
best
for
herself
and
the
most
desirable
seemed
to
be
comte
de
rocheverte
a
new
arrival
in
america
whom
she
had
met
for
the
first
time
a
night
or
two
after
returning
to
new
york
of
course
he
was
nearly
as
splendid
a
person
as
a
real
marquis
of
loveland
would
have
been
but
though
conservative
girls
who
preferred
home
products
and
jealous
girls
whom
titled
foreigners
cultivate
called
french
counts
thick
as
blackberries
and
nearly
as
common
elinor
had
a
weakness
for
old
aristocracies
besides
de
rocheverte
seemed
to
her
of
that
dashing
type
which
prides
itself
on
doing
anything
to
please
a
woman
if
she
asked
him
to
play
a
certain
part
in
her
little
comedy
she
thought
that
he
would
carry
it
off
gaily
whereas
the
rôle
might
not
be
to
the
taste
of
her
american
friends
she
sent
a
note
by
messenger
to
a
club
of
which
the
comte
had
been
made
an
honorary
member
to
make
certain
of
securing
him
then
his
answer
having
assured
her
that
raoul
de
rocheverte
was
entirely
and
devotedly
at
her
service
when
where
and
how
she
liked
she
telephoned
to
the
four
girls
she
wanted
for
the
adventure
of
these
one
could
not
come
another
could
but
would
for
the
same
reason
as
fanny
this
was
madge
beverly
and
the
remaining
two
thought
it
would
be
more
fun
than
a
wedding
each
would
bring
a
man
milton
also
could
be
trusted
to
find
one
and
the
party
would
therefore
consist
of
eight
never
since
bill
willing
had
first
made
the
fame
of
alexander
the
great
had
there
been
such
a
busy
day
in
the
red
restaurant
as
the
day
when
tony
story
and
sketch
of
the
marquis
of
twelfth
street
appeared
in
new
york
light
breakfast
was
almost
normal
but
an
unusual
number
of
people
strolled
in
between
nine
and
eleven
pie
and
milk
hours
and
nearly
all
had
newspapers
in
their
hands
as
they
sat
at
the
tables
sipping
a
glass
of
milk
they
glanced
at
something
in
the
paper
and
stared
at
the
tall
young
man
in
evening
clothes
who
moved
about
solemnly
with
a
tray
of
plates
or
cups
and
saucers
by
noon
there
was
a
rush
of
customers
the
crowd
increased
rather
than
diminished
up
to
one
and
throughout
the
afternoon
the
place
was
crammed
luckily
foreseeing
that
the
new
waiter
would
be
awkward
more
valuable
for
ornament
than
for
use
alexander
had
accepted
the
services
of
a
young
pole
in
dutchy
place
there
was
also
blinkey
but
blinkey
was
deep
in
the
agony
of
hopeless
love
for
the
boss
beautiful
daughter
and
was
not
to
be
counted
on
with
any
confidence
owing
to
his
habit
of
gazing
at
isidora
when
she
was
in
sight
and
pouring
hot
liquids
down
clients
necks
if
she
suddenly
disappeared
there
was
more
work
than
alexander
loveland
and
the
two
others
could
do
therefore
soon
after
twelve
the
aid
of
miss
izzie
had
to
be
called
in
the
coloured
cook
and
the
cook
assistant
worked
until
their
brains
were
as
nearly
addled
as
any
egg
ever
employed
in
their
most
economical
moments
and
to
several
members
of
the
staff
the
reason
for
the
rush
remained
a
mystery
alexander
knew
and
smiled
in
his
sleeve
isidora
knew
and
cast
reproachful
i
told
you
so
glances
at
her
father
as
she
heard
the
rustle
of
opening
newspapers
but
the
pole
did
not
understand
the
curious
questions
people
whispered
to
him
blinkey
was
stupid
as
well
as
sullen
while
as
for
loveland
himself
none
dared
to
catechise
him
so
set
were
his
lips
so
threatening
his
brows
of
course
he
suspected
that
it
was
he
who
brought
the
crowd
and
raged
in
the
shame
of
his
burning
martyrdom
alexander
had
said
that
he
was
to
be
used
for
all
he
was
worth
and
he
was
sure
that
already
he
was
in
some
way
being
used
but
he
did
not
know
how
or
guess
the
worst
at
first
when
the
place
began
to
fill
and
eyes
regarded
him
with
interest
there
was
a
hot
instant
when
he
asked
himself
if
a
new
card
had
been
hung
in
the
window
offering
a
british
lord
as
an
attraction
a
kind
of
side
dish
with
sauce
piquante
but
he
had
slept
at
the
bat
hotel
the
night
before
and
in
coming
on
duty
had
seen
the
cards
as
usual
there
had
been
no
sensational
addition
to
the
number
and
no
opportunity
for
anybody
to
have
made
one
since
unseen
by
him
bill
had
received
no
orders
for
any
secret
new
design
loveland
was
sure
for
bill
was
loyal
and
would
certainly
have
warned
him
val
supposed
therefore
that
alexander
must
have
told
people
that
the
marquis
of
loveland
would
act
as
a
waiter
in
the
restaurant
that
such
people
had
passed
the
news
to
others
and
so
on
working
upon
the
snowball
system
this
great
increase
of
visitors
being
the
result
loveland
hated
his
notoriety
with
hatred
inexpressible
though
it
was
in
a
way
a
ghastly
sort
of
tribute
to
the
importance
of
the
british
aristocracy
it
was
not
however
the
sort
of
tribute
his
vanity
craved
and
his
one
consolation
was
that
the
crowd
alexander
had
drawn
to
gaze
at
the
tame
marquis
was
a
common
crowd
indeed
he
thought
there
was
no
danger
that
the
red
restaurant
would
be
invaded
by
the
upper
classes
he
would
not
see
or
be
seen
by
the
sort
of
people
he
would
have
met
if
he
had
not
stumbled
into
this
obscure
pitfall
of
misfortune
soon
too
he
should
have
earned
enough
money
to
climb
out
of
it
and
leave
the
country
with
the
feigned
indifference
of
a
caged
white
bear
for
a
bank
holiday
crush
the
new
waiter
performed
his
duties
during
the
day
if
the
restaurant
were
crammed
throughout
the
afternoon
by
six
there
was
a
mob
by
seven
however
the
place
began
to
clear
and
alexander
rejoiced
because
there
was
much
work
for
his
staff
to
do
before
eight
dishes
must
be
washed
and
special
food
cooked
and
a
dozen
tables
prepared
for
two
crowds
who
had
engaged
accommodation
in
advance
one
was
a
wedding
party
of
italians
numbering
fifteen
the
other
was
something
more
exciting
a
party
of
swells
who
had
telephoned
for
dinner
at
eight
chapter
fire
laughing
and
talking
they
all
trouped
into
the
restaurant
elinor
coolidge
and
comte
de
rocheverte
eva
tanner
and
kate
wood
with
the
handsome
hungarian
twins
who
were
rather
sought
after
in
new
york
just
then
baron
ludovic
zsencha
and
his
brother
paul
last
milton
and
tony
kidd
tony
had
intended
to
drop
in
at
alexander
in
any
case
to
have
a
look
at
the
marquis
of
twelfth
street
who
had
been
discovered
by
that
morning
light
but
he
would
have
come
on
directly
after
returning
from
a
second
out
of
town
expedition
if
a
telegram
had
not
been
forwarded
to
the
country
asking
him
to
be
milton
escort
this
invitation
tony
accepted
with
pleasure
not
only
because
it
tickled
his
sense
of
humour
to
go
to
alexander
as
a
member
of
a
slumming
party
but
because
he
hoped
to
see
fanny
milton
whom
he
thought
the
sweetest
girl
in
new
york
last
year
milton
would
hardly
have
considered
him
good
enough
socially
to
select
as
companion
but
there
were
people
who
looked
at
her
a
little
askance
now
and
she
could
not
pick
and
choose
as
she
had
done
tony
knew
very
well
to
what
he
owed
his
promotion
but
that
did
not
affect
him
in
the
least
if
it
gave
him
a
chance
of
seeing
fanny
he
was
disappointed
to
find
that
she
was
not
going
and
his
spirits
were
dashed
by
the
news
that
she
disapproved
of
the
loveland
sensation
for
which
he
knew
himself
to
be
largely
responsible
nevertheless
in
manner
he
was
as
gay
as
the
others
when
the
party
of
eight
made
its
merry
raid
upon
alexander
the
italian
marriage
feast
was
already
in
full
swing
but
neither
the
bridal
party
nor
any
of
the
thirty
or
forty
other
occupants
of
the
restaurant
were
too
deeply
absorbed
in
their
own
affairs
to
notice
the
arrival
of
the
swells
not
a
soul
in
the
room
but
instantly
recognised
the
fact
that
they
swells
for
though
the
ladies
had
put
on
their
plainest
gowns
for
the
expedition
and
the
men
had
been
forbidden
to
appear
in
evening
dress
there
was
a
marked
difference
between
alexander
eight
latest
guests
and
all
the
others
already
assembled
hullo
i
suppose
we
ought
to
feel
honoured
muttered
leo
cohen
who
had
just
arrived
from
the
west
and
was
paying
a
surprise
visit
to
the
establishment
of
his
future
he
had
demanded
fried
oysters
and
coffee
and
had
greatly
enjoyed
giving
the
order
to
the
handsome
new
member
of
alexander
staff
get
a
move
on
you
please
he
finished
pointing
his
black
moustache
and
prodding
his
white
teeth
with
a
gold
toothpick
as
he
stared
at
the
man
made
notorious
by
today
newspapers
pressing
his
lips
tightly
together
loveland
turned
away
to
pass
the
order
to
black
dick
the
cook
it
was
at
this
moment
that
milton
party
entered
the
restaurant
and
cohen
murmured
his
comment
to
isidora
who
at
her
urgent
suggestion
was
hovering
about
that
young
gentleman
table
looking
her
prettiest
tony
kidd
at
milton
request
had
telephoned
for
a
table
for
eight
to
be
withdrawn
as
far
as
possible
from
the
big
front
window
that
dinner
and
diners
need
not
be
criticised
by
the
man
in
the
street
alexander
had
therefore
caused
blinkey
to
drag
the
largest
table
in
the
room
close
to
the
curtained
door
at
the
back
at
this
table
by
the
time
loveland
had
given
cohen
order
to
black
dick
and
returned
across
the
corridor
which
divided
the
restaurant
from
the
kitchen
the
four
pretty
women
and
their
escorts
had
taken
their
seats
the
door
behind
the
curtain
was
never
shut
in
business
hours
and
as
loveland
pushed
back
the
red
drapery
carrying
a
tray
loaded
with
ice
cream
for
the
italians
he
looked
straight
into
the
eyes
of
elinor
coolidge
milton
and
the
newspaper
man
tony
kidd
they
and
their
companions
had
already
been
searching
the
room
for
him
but
their
presence
took
him
completely
by
surprise
not
since
early
morning
had
he
found
a
moment
rest
he
had
had
no
appetite
and
would
have
had
little
time
to
eat
even
if
he
had
been
hungry
the
day
work
had
irritated
and
unnerved
him
up
to
the
last
notch
of
his
endurance
no
battle
of
his
brief
but
lively
south
african
experience
had
cost
him
physically
or
mentally
as
much
as
these
thirteen
hours
of
waiting
on
alexander
customers
and
the
sudden
sight
of
those
familiar
faces
smiling
coolly
on
his
shame
came
upon
him
like
a
volley
of
bullets
from
a
gun
involuntarily
he
took
a
step
back
knocked
the
edge
of
the
tray
against
the
and
dropped
it
with
a
crash
of
breaking
crockery
plates
smashed
spoons
flew
and
gushed
among
the
ruins
blinkey
and
the
polish
waiter
sprang
to
their
colleague
assistance
not
displeased
however
that
he
should
be
disgraced
alexander
scolded
the
italian
bride
screamed
and
had
to
be
reassured
by
the
bridegroom
leo
cohen
laughed
disagreeably
isidora
jumped
and
milton
party
looked
at
each
other
from
under
lifted
eyebrows
illustration
he
took
a
step
back
and
dropped
the
tray
with
a
crash
of
breaking
in
the
confusion
of
the
breakage
loveland
found
himself
again
pride
came
to
his
rescue
not
mere
hurt
vanity
but
a
truer
pride
than
had
ever
made
his
heart
beat
high
as
he
bent
down
to
pick
up
the
broken
plates
he
told
himself
that
these
people
who
had
come
to
plunge
him
still
deeper
in
humiliating
depths
were
not
worth
a
pang
and
should
not
see
that
they
had
power
to
inflict
it
they
had
caught
him
unawares
but
he
knew
the
worst
now
and
would
bear
it
without
letting
those
laughing
curious
eyes
see
how
their
glances
made
him
suffer
for
one
short
instant
he
detested
milton
so
intensely
that
he
half
regretted
his
vow
to
spare
her
name
at
all
hazards
but
by
the
time
he
had
picked
up
the
last
piece
of
broken
crockery
he
knew
that
if
everything
were
to
come
over
again
he
would
do
as
he
had
done
i
take
dat
out
of
your
wages
said
alexander
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
by
those
who
sat
round
the
table
near
to
the
curtained
door
of
course
replied
loveland
his
voice
steady
i
should
have
thought
the
british
aristocracy
would
have
such
clumsy
ways
leo
cohen
remarked
audibly
to
isidora
then
calling
jocularly
across
the
room
say
alexander
got
any
mock
turtle
soup
tonight
no
growled
alexander
thought
you
might
be
makin
a
speciality
of
it
this
week
went
on
cohen
why
oh
cute
idea
for
an
advertisement
turtle
served
by
mock
marquis
a
titter
went
round
the
room
among
those
who
had
enough
english
to
understand
the
joke
and
there
was
even
a
faint
suppressed
sound
of
laughter
at
milton
table
loveland
turned
white
he
had
an
impulse
to
hurl
the
broken
dishes
now
collected
on
the
tray
straight
at
cohen
oiled
black
head
and
a
week
ago
he
would
have
done
so
without
stopping
to
reflect
but
he
had
lived
longer
in
six
days
since
landing
in
new
york
than
in
as
many
years
before
and
he
was
learning
a
lesson
which
no
one
had
even
tried
to
teach
him
in
the
past
mastery
of
himself
he
knew
that
if
he
took
violent
revenge
upon
the
insolent
young
jew
his
late
shipmates
and
their
friends
would
delight
in
the
exhibition
they
would
think
that
they
were
getting
their
money
worth
out
of
the
show
and
loveland
determined
not
to
play
mountebank
for
their
entertainment
pale
but
perfectly
composed
in
appearance
he
did
not
even
look
towards
cohen
and
seemed
to
take
no
more
notice
of
the
young
man
impertinence
than
of
the
barking
of
some
mongrel
dog
too
feeble
to
be
kicked
ardently
loveland
longed
to
get
out
of
the
room
and
to
stay
out
but
though
he
could
have
escaped
by
carrying
the
broken
dishes
into
the
kitchen
he
would
not
deign
to
turn
his
back
on
the
enemy
he
gave
the
tray
to
blinkey
and
obeyed
a
gesture
of
alexander
which
sent
him
to
take
a
new
order
from
the
italians
i
do
believe
he
come
to
wait
on
us
whispered
milton
to
tony
kidd
if
he
does
it
will
have
been
hardly
worth
the
fag
of
coming
all
this
way
downtown
his
handing
us
our
things
would
have
been
the
best
fun
of
all
i
think
you
get
your
fun
mumbled
tony
but
he
was
not
enjoying
himself
of
course
the
man
a
fraud
and
deserves
all
he
got
the
journalist
thought
but
i
hanged
if
i
like
seeing
him
take
his
medicine
he
a
good
plucked
one
anyhow
never
glancing
at
the
eight
faces
which
watched
his
every
movement
with
sixteen
brilliant
eyes
loveland
passed
their
table
and
went
to
tell
the
cook
that
the
italian
party
would
have
a
rum
omelet
in
place
of
the
lost
cohen
fried
oysters
were
ready
the
pole
having
just
served
them
and
now
the
second
course
of
the
dinner
begun
already
with
blue
points
was
waiting
for
the
swells
it
was
soup
and
loveland
had
either
to
carry
it
in
and
serve
it
himself
or
else
to
show
that
the
torture
of
the
lash
was
beyond
his
endurance
they
shall
see
that
i
not
ashamed
for
myself
or
afraid
of
them
he
resolved
returning
to
the
restaurant
with
a
steaming
tureen
and
eight
hot
plates
on
a
tray
without
a
change
of
expression
he
laid
those
eight
plates
one
by
one
in
their
places
on
the
table
and
then
with
a
hand
which
he
forced
to
be
steady
he
ladled
out
the
soup
the
ladies
drew
back
as
if
uneasy
lest
he
might
seek
some
small
revenge
but
he
was
careful
not
to
spill
a
drop
biscuits
vous
said
comte
de
rocheverte
looking
loveland
straight
and
superciliously
in
the
eyes
but
the
english
waiter
did
not
flinch
from
the
stare
of
the
french
nobleman
he
walked
quietly
to
the
counter
took
some
biscuits
which
isidora
called
crackers
from
a
glass
jar
put
them
on
a
platter
and
handed
them
to
each
member
of
milton
party
he
understands
french
murmured
de
rocheverte
to
miss
coolidge
he
must
have
had
some
education
loveland
heard
and
swallowed
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
knew
that
the
young
man
and
the
girl
were
looking
at
him
talking
of
him
and
that
if
he
were
visibly
distressed
by
the
knowledge
they
would
be
the
more
amused
but
he
snatched
a
moment
respite
in
waiting
upon
a
seedy
bearded
stranger
who
had
just
come
in
and
taken
an
isolated
table
a
stranger
who
looked
like
a
foreigner
a
person
who
would
not
be
interested
in
a
marquis
born
of
any
nation
in
a
moment
however
came
a
summons
from
alexander
you
attend
to
the
ladies
and
gents
was
the
boss
order
blinkey
can
see
to
that
feller
what
does
he
want
a
and
black
coffee
said
loveland
oh
pa
do
send
gordon
to
wait
on
the
swells
again
softly
pleaded
isidora
flitting
up
uneasily
they
trying
to
take
a
rise
out
of
him
it
crool
i
thank
you
but
i
do
mind
miss
alexander
said
loveland
with
a
grateful
look
which
went
so
straight
to
isidora
heart
that
tears
started
to
her
eyes
val
took
away
the
eight
soup
plates
and
would
not
see
the
amused
glances
of
the
hungarians
or
elinor
coolidge
french
count
rocheverte
was
not
cruel
at
heart
but
he
did
not
like
englishmen
at
best
and
elinor
coolidge
having
told
him
the
story
of
lord
loveland
as
she
knew
it
had
said
we
girls
want
to
punish
him
not
only
for
the
way
he
would
have
deceived
us
all
if
he
could
but
for
his
perfectly
horrid
supercilious
airs
when
we
used
to
know
him
on
board
ship
so
please
help
us
by
sneering
and
staring
as
much
as
you
can
without
making
a
scene
she
had
looked
so
handsome
when
she
made
this
request
that
de
rocheverte
had
told
her
he
would
grant
it
with
pleasure
and
he
was
doing
his
best
to
keep
his
word
they
had
got
as
far
in
the
dinner
as
chicken
fried
with
cream
gravy
for
which
black
dick
was
renowned
when
the
restaurant
door
opened
and
milton
walked
in
accompanied
by
another
man
milton
flushed
with
vexation
for
she
was
sure
that
he
had
come
back
to
town
thus
unexpectedly
with
the
idea
of
surprising
her
that
he
must
have
gone
home
and
questioned
fanny
as
to
her
mother
whereabouts
and
then
have
followed
to
alexander
solely
for
the
satisfaction
of
spoiling
her
pleasure
unless
a
little
for
the
sake
of
seeing
his
late
antagonist
figuring
as
a
waiter
milton
sauntered
over
to
the
table
and
spoke
to
everyone
civilly
darting
only
one
covert
ugly
glance
at
his
wife
when
her
fascinated
gaze
rested
upon
the
fading
bruise
which
discoloured
his
square
jaw
read
this
morning
tony
and
the
afternoon
papers
copying
it
he
said
thought
i
drop
in
at
the
cockfight
and
see
the
fun
great
stunt
is
it
he
eyed
loveland
up
and
down
as
if
the
englishman
were
a
freak
at
a
museum
of
course
the
story
was
yours
for
the
first
time
val
eyes
and
tony
met
only
for
an
instant
but
there
was
something
like
reproach
in
loveland
a
trapped
hare
might
have
thrown
a
look
like
that
at
the
keeper
who
trapped
him
i
suppose
he
thinks
it
was
revenge
for
the
slammed
door
the
young
newspaperman
said
to
himself
but
it
was
i
not
that
kind
of
chap
i
like
him
to
know
i
not
but
i
expect
it
have
to
go
at
that
well
ta
ta
said
milton
and
i
order
something
for
the
good
of
the
house
now
we
here
we
not
obliged
to
eat
it
thank
heaven
he
turned
away
and
was
drawing
out
a
chair
for
himself
near
one
upon
which
the
seedy
bearded
stranger
had
placed
a
small
leather
handbag
when
suddenly
the
whole
restaurant
seemed
alive
with
dry
crackling
explosions
and
in
the
same
instant
the
electric
lamps
went
out
the
room
a
moment
ago
brilliantly
lighted
was
black
as
a
vault
save
for
a
glimmer
from
the
street
that
shone
through
the
window
then
as
everyone
jumped
up
overturning
chairs
or
breaking
glasses
in
their
hurry
and
the
shrieks
of
the
italian
women
mingled
with
the
strange
crackling
sounds
there
came
from
somewhere
at
the
back
a
loud
detonation
followed
by
a
hoarse
roaring
like
a
blast
furnace
men
cried
out
in
amazed
alarm
and
the
dark
room
lit
up
ominously
with
a
crimson
glare
that
turned
the
curtain
through
which
it
leaked
the
colour
of
blood
in
rushed
black
dick
and
his
assistant
with
blinkey
who
had
been
busy
in
the
kitchen
and
all
three
shouted
wildly
fire
fire
the
restaurant
was
in
a
state
of
chaos
a
long
jet
of
flame
sweeping
out
from
the
kitchen
and
across
the
narrow
passage
caught
the
curtain
in
the
up
which
little
serpents
of
fire
began
to
crawl
every
woman
was
screaming
now
in
a
panic
of
fear
whipped
to
horror
by
the
red
darkness
and
the
crackling
explosions
which
snapped
and
spluttered
on
every
side
the
excitable
italians
chattered
and
struggled
with
one
another
in
the
dark
the
new
polish
waiter
ran
here
and
there
like
a
frightened
chicken
that
sees
the
axe
the
two
negroes
were
almost
in
convulsions
and
tony
kidd
called
vainly
on
the
hungarian
brothers
and
de
rocheverte
for
help
in
bringing
order
out
of
confusion
the
thought
that
flashed
through
the
minds
of
all
was
an
anarchist
plot
a
dynamite
bomb
for
one
terrible
second
everybody
remembered
the
bearded
stranger
with
the
little
bag
and
debited
him
with
the
deadly
mischief
everyone
perhaps
except
loveland
and
tony
kidd
into
their
heads
the
same
thought
sprang
at
the
same
moment
for
each
it
happened
had
in
his
memory
some
such
scene
as
this
at
the
time
of
the
first
explosion
loveland
had
been
quietly
setting
a
plate
of
fried
chicken
before
tony
and
as
the
journalist
leaped
from
his
seat
the
two
young
men
were
close
together
short
circuiting
escape
from
a
fused
gas
pipe
loveland
yelled
through
the
noise
yes
that
it
the
reporter
shouted
back
mechanically
as
if
to
a
friend
then
for
a
few
seconds
tony
was
overwhelmed
by
a
wild
rush
of
frightened
women
in
the
red
light
that
streamed
through
the
burning
curtain
he
saw
a
crowd
fighting
to
reach
the
window
and
the
closed
front
door
of
the
restaurant
upon
his
incredulous
eyes
flashed
a
horrid
tableau
of
de
rocheverte
throwing
off
elinor
coolidge
who
clung
to
him
crying
save
me
save
me
as
the
frenchman
blindly
flung
her
away
and
dashed
towards
the
door
the
girl
would
have
fallen
on
her
knees
to
be
trampled
under
foot
by
the
two
hungarians
had
not
loveland
pushed
the
men
violently
aside
and
caught
elinor
in
his
arms
keep
her
keep
all
the
ladies
in
this
corner
out
of
the
crush
he
cried
to
tony
i
going
to
turn
off
the
gas
at
the
main
then
he
gave
elinor
half
fainting
to
tony
kidd
who
firmly
called
milton
miss
turner
and
miss
wood
by
name
the
sound
of
the
two
calm
voices
in
the
midst
of
shouts
smashing
glass
falling
chairs
and
foreign
exclamations
rallied
the
women
courage
as
tony
held
elinor
the
three
others
passed
near
him
deserted
by
the
foreigners
of
their
party
and
in
the
bloodshot
haze
all
saw
loveland
tall
figure
apparently
plunge
into
the
flame
he
made
a
dash
through
the
his
arms
thrown
across
his
eyes
to
shield
them
from
the
fire
and
ten
seconds
later
the
loud
roaring
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
the
cracklings
had
ceased
too
for
the
short
circuiting
was
over
and
the
stream
of
gas
burnt
itself
out
an
instant
after
loveland
seized
the
handle
of
the
main
but
the
curtain
still
blazed
the
stairway
in
the
passage
the
door
frames
in
the
kitchen
and
restaurant
were
on
fire
and
the
panic
raged
as
wildly
as
ever
among
the
fallen
chairs
and
tables
the
doorhandle
had
been
broken
by
leo
cohen
as
he
fiercely
disputed
with
milton
the
right
to
get
out
first
and
none
could
now
escape
that
way
although
men
battered
the
panels
and
strove
to
break
them
in
someone
had
smashed
a
hole
in
the
thick
plate
glass
window
big
enough
to
create
a
dangerous
draught
but
not
large
enough
to
give
a
means
of
retreat
for
any
of
the
men
and
women
who
with
cut
and
bleeding
hands
struggled
to
squeeze
through
the
jagged
opening
one
hand
badly
burnt
face
and
hair
singed
loveland
was
back
in
a
minute
from
his
errand
at
the
gas
main
he
had
snatched
up
a
huge
kettle
of
water
from
the
stove
and
dashed
it
onto
the
stairs
quenching
the
small
flames
which
had
begun
to
curl
and
writhe
then
tearing
down
the
curtain
he
trampled
out
the
fire
and
as
the
flames
died
into
shooting
sparks
and
feebly
puffing
smoke
he
urged
tony
to
bring
the
ladies
that
way
upstairs
we
get
them
upstairs
out
of
the
crowd
he
shouted
but
instantly
the
whole
throng
would
have
turned
to
stream
in
that
direction
had
not
tony
kidd
kept
the
way
clear
by
making
an
obstacle
of
his
own
broad
shoulders
he
got
a
fierce
blow
or
two
but
held
the
pass
until
the
four
ladies
of
his
party
and
isidora
had
reached
shelter
with
loveland
the
women
safe
tony
tore
off
his
coat
and
began
beating
down
the
fiery
snakes
which
crawled
up
the
door
frame
towards
the
ceiling
loveland
meanwhile
having
refuged
the
four
ladies
with
isidora
hurried
back
to
stand
by
tony
kidd
together
they
collected
all
the
italian
women
whom
they
lifted
bodily
over
a
barricade
of
tables
and
grouped
in
a
corner
beyond
the
reach
of
fire
or
crowd
it
was
left
for
blinkey
to
give
the
alarm
being
the
thinnest
and
smallest
he
contrived
to
squeeze
his
lean
body
through
the
broken
window
and
shout
for
the
police
three
minutes
later
two
big
men
in
blue
sent
the
door
crashing
off
its
hinges
into
the
restaurant
and
by
the
time
the
fire
engines
swept
clanging
and
snorting
into
the
street
the
flames
were
stifled
and
alexander
had
found
a
few
candles
to
light
up
the
smoky
darkness
the
whole
drama
in
one
act
had
played
itself
out
from
beginning
to
end
in
less
than
ten
minutes
but
it
had
come
close
to
tragedy
as
none
realised
more
fully
than
the
two
whom
it
had
very
strangely
brought
together
lord
loveland
and
tony
kidd
chapter
you
a
man
no
one
was
killed
or
seriously
injured
fortunately
for
alexander
the
great
popularity
many
hands
and
faces
were
cut
with
two
or
three
women
had
bruises
or
sprained
wrists
and
the
italian
bride
and
groom
were
objects
for
compassion
loveland
and
tony
kidd
had
saved
the
situation
nobody
else
seemed
to
have
accomplished
anything
deserving
praise
but
when
calm
followed
storm
de
rocheverte
milton
his
friend
mason
and
the
two
hungarians
vied
with
one
another
in
volubly
explaining
each
act
and
failure
to
act
they
had
wanted
to
make
a
way
out
for
the
ladies
that
was
why
they
had
tried
to
get
to
the
door
but
they
had
been
caught
and
overwhelmed
in
the
crowd
they
all
talked
fast
and
eagerly
almost
convincingly
but
the
ladies
pale
and
shattered
listened
without
answering
and
when
they
thanked
tony
kidd
for
saving
them
from
being
burnt
alive
they
were
careful
neither
to
contradict
nor
assent
when
he
assured
them
that
it
was
our
brave
pretender
who
did
everything
as
for
loveland
he
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
while
the
police
asked
questions
the
firemen
examined
dark
corners
and
the
battered
crowd
trailed
gloomily
away
tony
looked
in
vain
for
his
comrade
in
battle
milton
for
appearance
sake
was
compelled
to
offer
escort
to
his
wife
who
cried
and
laughed
hysterically
when
she
did
not
show
symptoms
of
fainting
the
husband
presence
relieved
tony
from
guard
duty
and
he
alleged
as
an
excuse
for
staying
behind
the
necessity
to
make
a
story
out
of
the
business
his
party
left
the
restaurant
in
carriages
and
motors
sadder
and
perhaps
wiser
but
no
one
asked
for
loveland
even
if
they
thought
of
him
the
women
who
had
come
to
see
him
play
the
rôle
of
waiter
could
hardly
acclaim
him
in
the
part
of
hero
while
as
for
the
men
if
they
realised
what
he
and
tony
kidd
had
done
it
was
not
to
their
interest
or
credit
to
acknowledge
it
loveland
had
not
however
mysteriously
disappeared
he
was
only
keeping
himself
in
the
background
and
the
one
background
available
at
alexander
was
the
kitchen
it
was
now
a
smoky
and
dismal
kitchen
with
a
wild
litter
of
pots
and
pans
a
table
overturned
broken
dishes
eggs
oysters
and
raw
batter
strewing
the
floor
nevertheless
it
seemed
a
haven
of
refuge
to
loveland
after
what
he
had
suffered
his
dash
through
the
flames
to
find
the
gas
main
had
been
a
deed
more
gallant
perhaps
than
the
impulsive
rescue
on
the
battlefield
which
won
him
his
tonight
he
had
deliberately
counted
the
cost
whereas
in
south
africa
he
had
acted
first
and
thought
afterwards
he
was
not
excited
now
that
was
all
over
and
there
was
time
to
think
yet
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
conducted
himself
not
unworthily
funny
thing
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
his
burnt
left
hand
and
his
singed
coat
funny
thing
i
suppose
i
behaved
fairly
decently
because
i
had
to
do
it
and
there
was
no
other
way
but
i
fancied
myself
a
lot
more
before
this
for
a
grand
slam
at
bridge
or
a
right
and
left
shot
at
a
couple
of
birds
there
was
no
need
to
prove
his
courage
further
by
reappearing
in
the
restaurant
if
he
went
back
it
would
look
as
if
he
were
bidding
for
compliments
from
his
late
tormentors
and
heaven
knew
that
he
wanted
nothing
of
the
sort
he
wanted
only
to
be
let
alone
so
he
lurked
in
the
kitchen
and
looked
on
while
black
dick
and
dick
still
blacker
calculated
and
repaired
the
damage
to
their
supplies
he
even
condescended
to
set
the
fallen
table
on
its
legs
again
and
in
return
for
this
service
dick
was
binding
up
his
injured
hand
when
the
sound
of
a
voice
behind
his
back
made
him
turn
quickly
see
here
said
tony
kidd
i
been
looking
for
you
because
i
want
to
tell
you
something
whatever
else
you
may
or
may
not
be
you
a
man
anyhow
as
he
delivered
himself
of
this
speech
tony
pleasant
clever
face
lost
the
quizzical
expression
it
was
wont
to
wear
and
looked
very
attractive
in
its
earnestness
thank
you
answered
loveland
rather
stiffly
then
melting
as
his
blue
eyes
and
tony
brown
ones
held
each
other
he
added
smiling
so
are
you
if
i
made
things
any
worse
for
you
i
sorry
went
on
tony
all
been
in
the
way
of
business
you
know
milton
words
to
the
young
journalist
had
cleared
the
mystery
of
the
crowd
who
had
glanced
up
from
their
newspapers
to
stare
at
the
english
waiter
and
gone
back
to
their
newspapers
again
tony
veiled
allusion
brought
no
surprise
to
loveland
therefore
and
he
answered
without
heat
it
does
matter
he
said
quietly
in
a
tired
voice
which
made
tony
wince
you
in
pain
are
you
he
asked
oh
nothing
to
speak
of
said
val
burnt
my
hand
and
wrist
a
little
that
all
it
was
a
narrow
shave
said
tony
by
jove
a
literally
for
you
pretty
well
made
a
clearance
of
hair
on
one
side
of
your
head
i
must
look
like
a
convict
returned
loveland
and
considering
everything
it
struck
tony
kidd
as
odd
that
the
englishman
should
make
that
particular
remark
about
himself
you
been
having
a
mighty
hard
time
of
it
since
er
since
i
saw
you
last
the
journalist
observed
it
has
been
an
experience
said
loveland
i
like
to
show
my
appreciation
of
the
way
you
acted
tonight
said
tony
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
the
thought
flashed
through
loveland
mind
that
he
might
tell
this
newspaper
man
the
whole
story
of
his
extraordinary
adventures
since
coming
to
new
york
the
trouble
with
the
bank
the
mysterious
silence
which
alone
had
answered
his
two
cablegrams
the
unaccountable
attitude
of
the
waldorf
management
and
the
rudeness
of
his
shipboard
acquaintances
in
the
restaurant
tony
kidd
had
certainly
written
up
or
caused
to
be
written
up
his
quarrel
with
milton
from
milton
point
of
view
and
now
he
had
evidently
drawn
public
attention
to
affairs
again
by
some
further
article
but
if
the
journalist
had
cherished
a
desire
for
revenge
apparently
he
felt
it
no
longer
now
he
was
hinting
that
he
wished
to
make
atonement
and
val
believed
that
he
meant
what
he
said
if
he
would
advance
money
on
the
letter
of
credit
but
no
after
a
moment
reflection
loveland
made
up
his
mind
not
to
ask
he
had
had
so
many
snubs
already
he
would
prefer
not
to
risk
another
he
told
himself
besides
after
all
that
had
happened
he
could
not
ask
a
favour
of
this
man
no
matter
how
pleasantly
it
had
been
offered
thank
you
very
much
but
i
think
there
nothing
you
can
do
loveland
answered
tony
knew
of
one
thing
that
he
could
do
and
had
already
decided
to
do
it
to
turn
the
tide
of
public
opinion
as
far
as
possible
by
a
graphic
description
of
the
fire
at
alexander
in
tomorrow
morning
light
but
after
all
that
would
not
accomplish
much
if
any
material
good
a
wave
of
sympathy
would
only
send
more
to
alexander
and
tony
keen
eyes
had
seen
through
loveland
mask
of
indifference
how
he
writhed
under
his
punishment
say
you
ca
stay
on
here
the
american
explained
impulsively
a
dog
life
and
whatever
you
are
whatever
you
been
you
too
much
of
a
gentleman
by
breeding
and
education
to
stand
it
you
have
to
quit
and
perhaps
i
could
think
of
some
way
out
if
you
i
thank
you
not
to
try
and
take
my
waiter
away
from
me
kidd
broke
in
alexander
the
great
speaking
so
suddenly
behind
the
two
young
men
that
both
started
like
guilty
things
upon
a
fearful
summons
this
is
the
right
place
for
him
alexander
and
you
know
it
retorted
tony
it
the
place
he
engaged
to
stay
in
until
he
leaves
the
country
alexander
persisted
and
i
mean
to
hold
him
to
his
word
or
know
the
reason
why
so
said
another
gentleman
of
your
race
once
remarked
tony
kidd
he
did
business
in
venice
but
in
the
end
a
lady
got
the
better
of
him
ladies
do
interfere
in
my
concerns
grumbled
alexander
who
had
not
a
prophetic
soul
and
did
not
guess
what
the
next
few
hours
might
have
in
store
for
him
if
gordon
leaves
me
without
a
week
notice
i
make
him
sorry
for
himself
he
saved
your
place
tonight
and
lord
knows
how
many
lives
said
tony
dat
ai
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
insisted
alexander
do
bother
thanks
loveland
said
hastily
to
tony
things
ca
be
worse
than
they
been
tonight
perhaps
they
be
better
i
shall
try
and
fight
it
out
here
till
i
can
see
my
way
pay
my
way
he
might
have
said
but
he
did
not
wish
to
bring
up
the
question
of
money
between
himself
and
tony
kidd
it
bad
enough
for
me
to
have
my
place
upset
went
on
alexander
without
having
my
people
enticed
to
leave
me
in
de
lurch
a
friendly
act
kidd
i
shall
be
days
makin
up
my
loss
what
wid
tings
busted
and
burnt
and
i
shall
need
all
the
help
i
can
get
to
put
the
restaurant
in
shape
again
tony
turned
impatiently
from
the
man
grumbling
well
if
you
let
me
do
anything
for
you
you
wo
he
said
to
loveland
all
the
same
i
sha
forget
and
the
time
may
come
now
i
must
be
off
and
write
my
story
he
put
out
a
hand
and
val
responded
with
his
unbandaged
one
if
any
one
had
told
tony
kidd
a
few
hours
before
that
he
would
yield
to
an
irresistible
impulse
impelling
him
to
shake
hands
heartily
with
the
notorious
marquis
of
twelfth
street
he
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
if
any
one
had
told
loveland
that
he
would
feel
pleased
even
complimented
by
the
offer
of
a
handshake
from
the
journalist
who
had
made
a
target
of
him
in
black
and
white
he
would
have
said
it
could
not
happen
yet
neither
thought
it
strange
when
it
did
happen
chapter
a
proposal
of
marriage
after
the
restaurant
was
cleared
and
all
outsiders
gone
alexander
remained
wandering
dolefully
about
the
room
and
discussing
with
leo
cohen
the
sum
he
hoped
to
get
from
the
company
in
which
he
was
insured
against
fire
the
conversation
ought
to
have
been
of
absorbing
interest
to
cohen
as
eventually
alexander
business
would
be
his
provided
there
were
no
hitch
in
the
marriage
negotiations
nevertheless
he
was
for
the
new
waiter
had
not
yet
left
the
premises
and
the
watchful
cohen
had
noticed
a
peculiar
light
in
isidora
eye
when
her
father
had
brusquely
ordered
her
upstairs
out
of
the
way
she
had
offered
no
objection
to
going
and
had
bidden
leo
very
prettily
but
before
tripping
away
she
paused
for
an
instant
in
the
corridor
her
face
turned
towards
the
kitchen
in
which
gordon
was
helping
black
dick
put
things
to
rights
cohen
noticed
this
turn
of
the
head
this
fluttering
hesitation
standing
as
he
did
near
the
now
stripped
of
the
red
curtain
but
when
isidora
had
vanished
above
alexander
dismissed
blinkey
and
the
pole
shutting
the
door
which
usually
stood
open
because
of
the
draught
from
the
broken
window
why
do
you
send
that
man
gordon
away
too
cohen
asked
because
i
payin
him
big
money
and
he
got
to
earn
it
explained
alexander
he
can
stay
and
help
dick
tidy
up
if
it
takes
till
twelve
it
ai
hurting
us
why
should
you
care
even
cohen
who
seldom
erred
on
the
side
of
timidity
in
speech
scarcely
ventured
to
put
into
words
the
reason
why
he
did
care
alexander
was
a
good
friend
of
his
and
desired
warmly
to
welcome
him
as
a
member
of
the
family
but
he
worshipped
his
daughter
izzie
and
as
he
had
a
violent
uncertain
temper
he
might
resent
a
suggestion
that
she
could
be
interested
in
gordon
cohen
had
a
rooted
objection
to
draughts
or
fresh
air
in
any
form
except
in
the
warmest
weather
still
he
would
have
preferred
a
draught
to
the
shut
door
behind
which
the
girl
might
steal
downstairs
to
gossip
with
the
englishman
in
the
kitchen
of
course
dick
was
there
but
he
was
a
slave
to
isidora
fascinations
and
the
youth
who
was
his
adjutant
had
now
gone
home
to
patch
up
burnt
hands
and
head
cohen
hardly
heard
what
alexander
said
so
keenly
was
he
pricking
his
ears
for
a
footfall
on
the
stairs
behind
the
closed
door
and
he
answered
at
random
while
his
intended
demonstrated
the
prospects
of
opening
the
restaurant
as
usual
in
the
morning
see
here
are
you
sick
or
what
the
matter
snapped
alexander
at
last
oh
i
all
right
said
cohen
only
the
smoke
got
into
my
eyes
they
smart
so
i
can
see
no
a
bat
if
it
had
been
for
the
smoke
which
always
makes
me
blind
and
dizzy
i
have
been
more
use
in
the
panic
alexander
laughed
well
you
were
no
hero
never
mind
though
most
of
us
was
put
out
of
business
and
nobody
had
time
to
see
what
anybody
else
was
at
but
you
do
seem
dicky
mebbe
you
better
be
gettin
home
i
do
want
to
keep
you
up
oh
i
not
all
in
yet
cohen
hastened
to
protest
but
ca
you
leave
me
to
watch
that
winder
while
you
see
after
izzie
she
was
lookin
white
and
scared
maybe
she
do
like
bein
left
alone
or
i
could
go
up
myself
and
sit
by
her
awhile
late
alexander
chuckled
say
you
mighty
thoughtful
ai
you
but
you
let
izzie
alone
tonight
i
know
dat
girl
and
de
best
ting
for
her
is
to
go
to
bed
it
ai
much
past
nine
said
cohen
i
do
guess
she
go
to
bed
yet
well
she
got
the
hired
gel
to
chat
with
unless
it
her
out
now
do
you
look
so
glum
leo
izzie
ai
mashed
on
you
yet
and
if
you
was
to
go
stir
her
up
when
she
all
on
the
jump
you
do
for
yourself
with
her
i
tell
you
dat
straight
and
dat
ai
what
you
want
huh
cohen
admitted
that
it
was
not
and
gloomily
allowed
his
services
to
be
enlisted
by
alexander
in
the
way
of
examining
the
furniture
for
damage
piling
broken
chairs
in
a
corner
and
sorting
out
those
in
a
fit
condition
to
be
used
tomorrow
meantime
isidora
had
been
busy
justifying
her
lover
worst
fears
as
she
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
she
heard
the
loud
slamming
of
the
door
which
had
been
warped
and
blistered
by
the
heat
her
heart
gave
a
little
jump
of
excitement
already
she
was
keyed
to
a
highly
emotional
state
and
in
her
longing
for
a
talk
with
loveland
alone
she
was
ready
to
run
almost
any
risk
the
thought
that
he
was
still
in
the
house
so
near
yet
so
far
had
been
almost
insupportable
and
she
had
fully
intended
to
have
a
good
cry
the
moment
she
arrived
in
the
upstairs
but
the
unexpected
shutting
of
the
restaurant
door
caused
her
a
tremor
of
delight
she
down
again
with
her
heart
loud
as
a
hammer
in
her
breast
and
flitted
softly
into
the
kitchen
not
daring
to
speak
till
she
had
quietly
closed
the
door
also
lest
the
sound
of
her
voice
should
carry
across
the
passage
oh
gordon
she
breathed
i
so
sorry
about
your
poor
hand
and
your
face
is
scorched
too
i
do
wish
you
let
me
do
something
for
you
loveland
thanked
her
but
said
that
dick
had
bandaged
up
his
hand
and
wrist
very
nicely
with
a
soothing
application
of
lard
on
an
old
rag
isidora
gave
a
little
sniff
of
scorn
for
the
negro
ministrations
a
pretty
bandage
she
sneered
a
nasty
torn
bit
of
coarse
towel
and
lard
ai
the
right
thing
either
i
taken
lessons
in
first
aid
all
the
girls
in
my
school
did
and
i
ai
forgot
what
i
learnt
please
come
with
me
and
i
do
you
up
all
right
now
do
say
no
or
hurt
my
feelings
i
feel
ready
to
cry
anyway
and
i
sure
will
if
you
ai
kind
loveland
disavowed
all
intention
of
being
unkind
but
assured
the
girl
that
he
was
in
very
little
pain
and
need
not
put
her
to
trouble
he
would
soon
be
ready
to
go
away
and
really
thought
it
would
be
better
but
when
he
had
got
so
far
in
his
rather
straggling
argument
two
tears
splashed
over
izzie
cheeks
more
threatened
to
follow
and
loveland
yielded
incontinently
it
would
hardly
have
been
human
not
to
feel
some
stirrings
of
gratitude
and
besides
loveland
hated
to
see
a
woman
cry
oh
i
come
he
said
desperately
and
followed
isidora
into
the
passage
her
finger
on
her
lip
told
him
that
his
visit
to
the
family
was
to
be
a
secret
but
even
if
prudence
would
have
turned
him
back
at
the
last
moment
he
was
committed
to
the
adventure
and
could
not
escape
the
parlour
which
also
served
as
was
appalling
in
its
bravery
of
old
gold
plush
and
portraits
of
defunct
hebrew
ladies
and
gentlemen
on
a
wall
paper
there
was
an
upright
piano
with
the
latest
thing
in
coon
songs
upon
it
there
were
wax
flowers
under
glass
cases
there
were
statuettes
of
incredible
ugliness
there
were
crocheted
tidies
on
the
sofas
and
chairs
on
the
centre
table
which
was
covered
with
a
blue
cloth
stood
a
lamp
that
had
been
lighted
when
the
electricity
failed
and
in
its
rays
filtering
softly
through
a
shade
composed
of
pink
paper
roses
isidora
looked
even
prettier
than
usual
perhaps
partly
in
contrast
with
her
hideous
surroundings
she
made
loveland
sit
down
in
a
leather
armchair
which
smelled
of
the
tobacco
her
father
affected
and
then
kneeling
on
a
low
footstool
beside
him
she
began
to
unfasten
black
dick
clumsy
bandage
i
do
like
to
have
you
wait
on
me
said
loveland
who
a
few
weeks
ago
took
the
most
exaggerated
petting
for
granted
from
pretty
women
well
i
like
to
it
anyhow
replied
the
girl
with
a
lingering
liquid
glance
you
so
brave
i
proud
to
be
waitin
on
you
i
never
knew
anybody
just
like
you
before
loveland
thought
this
very
probable
but
merely
remarked
with
becoming
modesty
that
he
had
done
very
little
you
were
a
real
hero
said
isidora
oh
o
oh
and
she
breathed
little
cooing
sighs
of
pity
at
sight
of
the
hero
burns
i
could
cry
over
your
poor
hand
it
a
shame
please
do
exclaimed
loveland
laughing
i
ca
stand
any
more
tears
did
you
mind
when
i
cried
asked
izzie
awfully
said
loveland
as
he
spoke
he
smiled
down
at
her
in
a
friendly
way
and
the
kindness
in
the
blue
eyes
made
the
girl
heart
flutter
like
an
imprisoned
bird
she
had
been
in
love
with
him
since
the
first
day
a
little
then
more
and
more
now
her
love
overflowed
it
was
too
much
for
her
emotional
nature
she
could
not
keep
it
back
and
why
should
she
try
to
keep
it
back
she
asked
herself
since
her
love
must
be
considered
an
honour
by
this
unsuccessful
foreign
adventurer
she
felt
that
she
was
like
a
queen
laying
down
her
crown
at
the
feet
of
a
handsome
beggar
she
alexander
the
great
only
daughter
and
heiress
there
was
no
question
in
her
mind
but
that
her
love
would
be
welcomed
i
glad
she
almost
sobbed
oh
you
worth
more
to
me
than
anything
in
the
world
i
wo
cry
again
if
you
ask
me
not
i
do
whatever
you
want
me
to
pa
kill
me
if
he
knew
i
was
talking
like
this
but
i
do
care
i
do
care
for
anybody
but
you
no
one
else
oh
suppose
i
let
pa
make
me
marry
leo
cohen
before
i
met
you
loveland
was
dumbfounded
my
dear
girl
he
exclaimed
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
you
i
do
know
isidora
broke
in
i
know
you
are
poor
and
in
a
lot
of
trouble
and
you
might
have
gone
to
prison
but
you
a
gentleman
all
right
you
you
and
that
enough
if
you
care
about
me
same
as
i
do
about
you
why
all
the
rest
but
i
i
mean
i
sure
you
do
really
care
stammered
val
checking
himself
on
the
verge
of
saying
something
rude
it
would
have
simplified
matters
if
he
had
said
it
for
opinion
of
her
own
high
value
as
alexander
rich
desirable
daughter
made
it
too
easy
for
her
to
misunderstand
i
do
care
you
need
be
afraid
she
assured
him
i
would
have
said
a
word
i
o
waited
for
you
to
speak
if
things
had
been
different
but
i
saw
how
you
felt
by
the
way
your
eyes
looked
a
minute
ago
and
i
would
stop
for
manners
because
i
says
to
myself
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
tell
a
girl
he
loves
her
when
he
got
nothing
and
she
everything
i
hope
i
am
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
val
began
desperately
but
she
cut
him
short
with
one
little
plump
hand
over
his
mouth
i
know
it
that
what
i
said
you
do
need
to
tell
me
she
hurried
on
we
have
to
run
away
and
get
married
then
pa
forgive
me
all
he
got
he
could
bear
me
to
want
for
anything
but
it
no
use
asking
him
first
he
dear
girl
i
have
no
idea
of
asking
him
no
of
course
you
ai
so
silly
his
heart
set
on
my
taking
leo
but
i
would
touch
him
with
a
pole
now
my
hero
i
marry
you
tomorrow
the
devil
you
will
said
alexander
they
stood
together
at
the
door
he
and
leo
cohen
who
had
persuaded
the
old
man
at
last
on
one
excuse
or
another
to
invite
him
upstairs
neither
loveland
nor
isidora
had
heard
the
door
open
neither
knew
how
long
the
eavesdroppers
had
listened
outside
the
girl
struggled
up
from
her
knees
and
as
loveland
bounded
out
of
the
big
chair
she
caught
his
arm
nestling
against
him
you
villain
stealin
my
gal
love
behind
my
back
and
enticin
her
to
run
off
with
you
stuttered
alexander
purple
with
fury
i
did
began
val
indignantly
what
you
did
roared
the
jew
you
want
me
to
believe
my
gal
asked
you
to
marry
her
loveland
started
as
if
alexander
had
struck
him
and
flushed
to
the
forehead
involuntarily
he
glanced
at
isidora
who
looked
up
at
him
beseechingly
spare
me
the
almond
eyes
implored
no
i
do
want
you
to
believe
that
he
said
and
how
hugely
he
would
have
laughed
had
he
been
told
a
few
weeks
ago
that
he
would
let
himself
be
misunderstood
and
shamed
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
like
isidora
but
now
he
did
not
feel
it
strange
that
he
should
make
this
sacrifice
for
her
and
curiously
enough
it
seemed
to
be
lesley
dearmer
voice
lesley
dearmer
eyes
which
haunting
him
always
bade
him
spare
this
common
little
jewess
at
any
cost
you
a
d
d
sneak
said
alexander
ai
you
ashamed
of
yourself
no
answered
loveland
shows
what
you
are
den
you
a
tief
you
try
to
steal
my
daughter
because
you
tink
you
get
her
money
oh
pa
he
loves
me
it
me
he
wants
wailed
isidora
weeping
yet
not
daring
to
defend
her
lover
at
the
expense
of
womanly
what
good
would
it
do
him
she
thought
for
her
to
confess
who
had
proposed
a
runaway
marriage
her
father
would
be
no
less
angry
with
gordon
and
he
would
be
a
great
deal
more
angry
with
her
so
angry
that
he
would
watch
her
always
perhaps
insist
on
an
immediate
wedding
with
leo
cohen
no
she
could
not
speak
and
besides
it
would
be
too
humiliating
before
leo
so
she
only
sobbed
and
sobbed
the
louder
when
loveland
gently
but
firmly
unlinked
her
arm
from
his
you
a
little
fool
izzie
or
you
would
believe
any
such
a
ting
alexander
scolded
her
somewhat
softened
by
her
tears
a
feller
like
dat
a
fraud
a
liar
if
you
were
a
younger
man
you
would
dare
to
say
that
loveland
cut
him
short
it
you
who
are
lying
what
you
call
me
a
liar
you
you
cheat
you
convict
sputtered
alexander
take
dat
for
your
impudence
and
rushing
at
loveland
like
an
angry
bull
he
struck
him
with
both
podgy
fists
isidora
screamed
and
seized
her
father
arms
struggling
with
him
crying
out
that
he
was
wicked
cruel
ungrateful
to
the
man
who
had
saved
his
house
from
burning
do
be
afraid
i
not
going
to
strike
back
loveland
reassured
her
he
knows
that
yes
he
knows
dat
because
he
knows
youse
a
coward
alexander
sneered
wheezing
asthmatically
you
come
over
here
to
cheat
noo
york
but
you
ai
done
it
not
much
lucky
for
you
you
ai
in
prison
now
you
get
out
of
my
house
quick
see
you
just
git
that
exactly
what
i
anxious
to
do
said
loveland
goodbye
miss
alexander
oh

ai
leavin
me
forever
cried
the
girl
pa
do
send
him
away
like
this
he
he
ai
to
blame
she
hesitated
stammering
then
a
wild
longing
to
keep
her
lover
at
all
hazards
overcame
fear
and
scruples
it
was
me
who
do
said
loveland
you
can
do
no
good
i
sha
forget
your
kindness
we
wo
see
each
other
again
but
you
must
forget
tonight
and
marry
some
man
who
can
make
you
happy
goodbye
once
more
and
pushing
regardlessly
past
cohen
who
hovered
near
the
door
he
sent
the
commercial
traveller
sprawling
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
black
dick
who
had
been
told
to
guard
the
broken
window
of
the
restaurant
in
the
master
absence
had
heard
all
or
most
of
the
disturbance
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
he
ran
after
loveland
to
suggest
the
wisdom
of
getting
money
from
alexander
he
am
a
mighty
wicked
ole
man
whispered
the
negro
you

a
lot
fur
him
an
now
he
kick
you
out
o
de
house
widout
wages
i
shall
never
get
a
penny
from
the
old
beast
it
useless
to
try
said
loveland
heavily
seeing
a
vision
of
ships
sailing
away
without
him
on
board
goodbye
dick
i
wish
i
had
something
to
give
you
to
remember
me
by
but
i
have
lawd
why
i
a
rich
man
wid
money
in
de
bank
protested
dick
do
you

because
i
got
a
black
face
i
take

odder
hand
i
lend
you
what
you
like
sah
and
you
pay
me
back
when
you
like
you
tret
me
like
a
gemman
loveland
thanked
him
curiously
touched
and
as
he
refused
the
loan
he
found
himself
somewhat
to
his
own
surprise
shaking
hands
warmly
with
the
coloured
cook
chapter
wanted
juvenile
leading
man
bill
willing
sat
reading
in
the
coldest
corner
of
the
in
the
bat
hotel
somehow
when
he
had
not
denuded
himself
of
his
last
nickel
and
could
afford
to
pay
for
a
corner
anywhere
it
was
always
the
coldest
corner
because
he
blithely
sacrificed
his
chances
of
the
warmer
ones
to
others
but
he
was
not
conscious
that
his
corner
was
cold
tonight
there
was
that
in
his
heart
which
would
have
made
the
edge
of
an
iceberg
seem
a
comfortable
and
he
was
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
paper
which
was
one
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
stage
that
loveland
had
to
speak
to
him
twice
before
he
heard
and
looked
up
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
started
stared
and
wanted
to
know
whether
loveland
battered
appearance
was
due
to
a
fight
or
a
fire
but
now
in
unusual
for
him
he
noticed
nothing
strange
just
look
at
this
my
boy
he
exclaimed
his
eye
sparkling
with
excitement
as
he
pointed
to
a
paragraph
which
he
had
marked
with
red
ink
from
a
bottle
on
the
table
the
paragraph
was
an
advertisement
in
the
midst
of
a
column
of
other
advertisements
apparently
all
of
the
same
nature
and
that
column
was
one
of
five
or
six
on
a
page
entirely
devoted
to
such
advertisements
still
the
few
lines
were
evidently
of
the
most
vital
importance
to
bill
and
loveland
supposed
he
had
hit
on
the
offer
of
some
wonderful
situation
such
as
he
had
been
looking
for
all
his
life
wanted
was
the
attractive
word
which
headed
the
paragraph
and
that
was
what
val
had
expected
but
as
he
read
on
he
grew
puzzled
wanted
for
repertoire

val
forgetting
his
own
troubles
enough
to
be
genuinely
interested
in
the
dramatic
development
of

love
episode

say
you
do
suppose
he
married
her
since
ca
have
at
least
not
unless
his
wife

off

hooks
said
bill
i
heard
of

not
a
year
ago
from
one
of
the
boys
who
used
to
supe
with

jacobus

gordon

i
could
get
them
to
take
me
i
afraid
said
loveland
i
not
an
actor
an
actor
repeated
bill
with
inexpressible
scorn
as
if
they
wanted
an
in
a
show
like
that
or
would
know
one
if
they
saw
him
you
a
good
looker
you
young
with
a
tall
slim
figure
and
all
the
other
qualifications
named
except
the
experience
and
the
wardrobe
pooh
said
bill
ai
you
ever
played
as
an
amateur
yes
once
or
twice
they
roped
me
in
said
loveland
recalling
a
brilliant
scene
in
the
of
a
duchess
and
another
for
the
success
of
which
some
of
the
young
officers
of
his
battalion
had
been
responsible
well
then
there
you
are
with
your
experience
and
as
for
the
wardrobe
my
goodness
lad
what
do
you
want
more
than
those
swell
tweeds
of
yours
and
the
dress
suit
you
got
on
if
it
comes
to
costoom
parts
why
the
management
will
just
have
to
fit
you
out
with
some
of
their
own
glad
rags
or
make
the
ghost
walk
your
way
in
advance
you
do
seem
to
think
much
of
your
star
company
if
you
believe
a
raw
amateur
with
hardly
a
stitch
to
his
back
would
be
good
enough
for
them
loveland
said
i
do
claim
it
a
noo
york
company
explained
bill
i
guess
they
doin
the
act
perhaps
i
been
kind
of
carried
away
thinkin
of
lillie
and
what
it
would
be
to
get
the
news
of
her
from
a
chum
i
do
suppose
there
much
in
this
for
you
maybe
do
better
at
alexander
now
you
a
kind
of
star
yourself
a
fallen
star
laughed
loveland
look
at
me
and
see
the
marks
i
got
sliding
down
the
sky
then
for
the
first
time
bill
noticed
that
his
friend
hair
was
singed
and
his
face
reddened
on
one
side
his
white
shirt
covered
with
black
spots
and
his
left
hand
partly
in
partly
out
of
a
clumsily
made
bandage
moses
but
you
have
been
through
the
wars
exclaimed
bill
and
he
listened
with
growing
excitement
to
loveland
version
of
the
fire
alexander
ought
to
give
you
a
partnership
he
commented
at
last
though
val
had
made
no
boast
of
his
own
part
in
the
affair
he
chucked
me
said
loveland
je
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
decent
it
was
in
the
name
of
everything
indecent
cheat
liar
coward
that
he
did
it
according
to
him
i
was
all
those
and
ought
to
be
in
prison
though
what
he
meant
by
his
weird
accusations
i
imagine
unless
he
just
hit
on
whatever
came
first
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
that
he
thought
i
been
making
love
to
his
daughter
gee
and
had
you
no
it
was
a
misunderstanding
but
i
could
explain
and
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
i
crawled
in
the
dust
for
a
few
wretched
dollars
which
it
seems
i
got
to
lose
after
all
i
do
know
how
i
to
touch
any
more
unless
i
do
as
you
say
and
get
this
place
with
your
friend
the
human
flower
you
go
asked
bill
brightening
rather
if
they
have
me
but
i
have
even
a
photograph
come
out
with
me
said
bill
seizing
him
by
his
sound
arm
i
know
a
place
where
they
do
you
a
by
flashlight
for
ten
cents
and
finish
while
you
wait
i
stand
the
racket
you
can
turn
your
good
side
to
the
machine
by
the
time
the
answer
comes
your
hair
have
grown
out
and
you
be
looking
a
hurrah
three
cheers
for
lillie
de
lisle
the
little
human
flower
and
her
new
juvenile
lead
chapter
thirty
show
folks
mo
dunk
shouted
a
brakeman
slamming
the
door
of
the
day
coach
in
which
loveland
had
traveled
since
some
vaguely
remembered
hour
in
the
night
when
he
had
changed
trains
he
had
dozed
sitting
on
the
hard
red
seat
his
head
leaning
wearily
against
the
and
he
started
up
at
the
yell
which
for
an
instant
seemed
part
of
his
dream
but
then
everything
lately
had
been
a
dream
his
weird
experiences
in
new
york
the
absence
of
replies
from
his
mother
and
the
london
bank
in
answer
to
his
cabled
appeals
the
coming
of
the
telegram
from
jack
jacobus
accepting
the
very
modest
terms
named
at
bill
suggestion
his
start
from
the
magnificent
grand
central
station
in
new
york
where
the
new
juvenile
lead
had
found
his
ticket
awaiting
him
and
now
as
he
bundled
half
dazed
out
of
the
local
train
he
had
boarded
some
hours
ago
the
dream
suddenly
grew
more
bewildering
than
ever
what
a
contrast
was
this
little
country
depot
with
the
splendours
of
the
grand
central
in
new
york
the
rough
frame
building
was
little
better
than
an
exaggerated
shed
and
no
town
was
to
be
seen
across
the
desolate
waste
of
brown
fields
which
billowed
round
the
railway
shelter
and
its
high
platform
like
a
wintry
sea
round
a
small
bleak
island
through
an
open
door
of
the
passengers
loveland
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
squat
stove
rising
like
a
grey
dwarf
from
a
big
box
of
sawdust
and
a
man
who
had
been
warming
his
hands
came
out
of
the
room
as
the
train
stopped
there
were
also
three
or
four
other
men
lolling
on
a
bench
outside
the
window
but
they
were
individuals
who
had
evidently
dragged
themselves
hither
through
the
mud
for
the
excitement
of
seeing
a
train
come
in
and
took
no
interest
beyond
that
of
curiosity
in
the
passengers
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
was
a
very
different
order
of
being
and
almost
offensively
conscious
of
the
difference
he
was
fifty
perhaps
and
tall
with
a
swaggering
walk
which
caused
the
shabby
coat
he
wore
to
swing
like
the
skirt
of
a
woman
dress
as
he
moved
forward
he
had
on
boots
cracked
with
old
age
and
caked
with
new
mud
his
rather
long
straight
hair
and
the
heavy
double
curve
of
his
moustache
clearly
owed
their
raven
tint
to
artificial
means
but
his
big
chin
was
blue
and
the
thick
brows
over
a
pair
of
light
grey
eyes
were
still
black
the
nose
and
mouth
though
ineffectively
cut
contrived
to
express
cruelty
and
an
insolence
which
was
accentuated
by
the
upward
tilt
of
a
cigar
between
the
strong
yellowish
teeth
and
the
downward
tilt
of
his
badly
kept
silk
hat
every
line
of
the
face
and
figure
every
article
of
clothing
bespoke
the
fifth
rate
seedy
actor
who
has
parted
in
his
time
with
most
things
except
his
the
idlers
on
the
bench
stared
at
him
then
at
the
newcomer
and
regarded
with
lazy
curiosity
the
meeting
between
the
two
for
this
gentleman
in
the
tall
silk
hat
and
fur
overcoat
was
jack
jacobus
come
to
claim
gordon
the
new
member
of
his
company
if
it
had
been
possible
for
loveland
heart
to
sink
lower
which
at
the
moment
he
did
not
believe
it
would
have
sunk
at
sight
of
miss
de
lisle
manager
but
he
asked
himself
what
else
had
he
a
right
to
expect
from
the
advertisement
and
bill
assurance
that
it
would
be
useless
to
demand
a
higher
weekly
screw
than
ten
dollars
the
management
paying
board
one
quick
glance
and
the
eyes
had
taken
in
each
detail
of
loveland
appearance
from
the
smartly
made
travelling
cap
which
still
kept
its
shape
down
to
the
neat
brown
boots
he
approved
all
it
was
evident
except
the
battered
gladstone
bag
which
bill
willing
had
bought
extraordinarily
cheap
at
a
pawnbroker
sale
as
a
gift
for
his
friend
gordon
this
loveland
carried
in
his
hand
and
he
saw
the
gaze
rest
sardonically
upon
it
in
a
deep
measured
voice
as
theatrical
as
the
rest
of
his
personality
jacobus
enquired
if
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
perceval
gordon
then
when
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
delivered
himself
of
a
few
polite
words
of
greeting
glad
you
got
here
all
right
do
know
what
we
should
have
done
if
you
had
turned
up
our
juvenile
lead
came
down
with
typhoid
at
our
last
week
stand
and
we
been
fakin
our
best
ever
since
any
old
play
we
could
that
had
the
fewest
men
and
the
lot
of
us
doublin
parts
till
we
was
ready
to
drop
on
the
stage
with
the
curtain
got
the
checks
handy
for
your
big
baggage
loveland
had
to
explain
that
he
had
no
big
baggage
and
under
the
changing
freezing
eyes
of
jacobus
felt
as
insignificant
as
a
crushed
worm
until
very
lately
he
had
not
known
the
meaning
of
this
sensation
now
he
was
becoming
accustomed
to
it
as
to
a
daily
worn
coat
but
never
perhaps
had
his
pride
been
more
flatly
ironed
out
than
in
this
brief
instant
what
no
wardrobe
demanded
the
manager
his
tone
of
friendly
condescension
to
a
new
member
of
his
company
altered
to
one
of
bullying
suspicion
my
wardrobe
is
here
said
loveland
holding
out
bill
present
sorry
i
forgot
to
bring
a
magnifying
glass
sneered
jacobus
but
see
here
i
call
this
false
pertences
how
are
you
going
to
play
a
new
part
every
night
of
the
week
some
of
costoom
ones
all
out
of
a
grip
no
bigger
than
your
pocket
you
ought
to
have
told
me
what
you
have
if
it
would
have
taken
you
too
long
ought
to
have
told
me
i
had
to
play
a
new
part
every
night
said
loveland
and
the
young
man
and
the
one
looking
each
other
straight
in
the
eyes
conceived
for
one
another
an
intense
dislike
i
was
given
to
understand
by
a
person
of
experience
that
i
should
have
enough
to
get
on
with
until
i
could
buy
something
if
necessary
well
that
depends
on
how
soon
you
buy
returned
jacobus
less
bitterly
you
knew
very
well
that
you
have
me
on
the
leg
once
you
got
out
here
at
this
godforsaken
place
with
your
ticket
paid
our
show
ai
made
of
money
especially
the
past
two
weeks
heavens
what
a
frost
we
been
livin
on
our
gleanings
from
last
month
when
we
were
going
like
smoke
and
countin
on
the
new
juvenile
lead
to
help
work
up
better
business
that
why
i
so
sore
at
your
cheek
gordon
shootin
yourself
out
west
with
what
you
stand
up
in
but
as
you
here
we
must
make
the
best
of
a
bad
business
the
girls
may
like
you
even
with
whiskers
on
your
shirtcuffs
and
i
suppose
among
us
we
rig
you
up
somehow
out
of
our
theatre
trunks
that
what
you
were
for
eh
look
here
if
you
going
to
insult
me
much
more
i
shall
turn
round
and
go
back
if
i
have
to
walk
said
loveland
cold
hungry
tired
and
miserable
but
with
just
spirit
enough
left
in
him
to
be
furious
jacobus
saw
that
he
had
gone
too
far
if
the
juvenile
lead
were
not
to
slip
through
his
fingers
he
did
not
want
that
to
happen
though
he
already
had
an
uneasy
jealousy
of
gordon
so
used
was
he
to
bullying
the
members
of
his
company
male
and
female
that
he
had
hardly
realised
what
was
likely
to
be
the
effect
of
his
sarcasm
until
he
saw
the
expression
of
the
newcomer
face
pshaw
he
exclaimed
laughing
do
you
know
a
joke
from
an
insult
in
your
part
of
the
country
it
give
me
a
start
to
see
you
land
without
a
wardrobe
and
i
have
a
right
to
be
mad
but
i
just
said
we
make
the
best
of
it
and
help
you
out
all
we
can
what
can
we
do
more
i
suppose
you
do
grudge
me
a
bit
of
fun
come
along
to
the
great
and
glorious
city
of
modunk
which
must
have
as
many
as
one
thousand
inhabitants
hope
you
do
mind
goin
on
shanks
mare
it
the
only
kind
we
get
in
this
town
even
if
we
ran
to
something
better
but
it
ai
far
about
a
mile
and
a
half
and
your
grip
ca
weigh
much
loveland
wished
that
he
had
no
heavier
burden
to
carry
than
his
bag
but
he
kept
the
thought
to
himself
and
trudged
off
with
the
arbiter
of
his
destiny
the
loungers
on
the
bench
too
far
away
to
overhear
the
conversation
guessed
that
it
was
not
altogether
of
a
friendly
nature
and
transferred
their
quids
of
tobacco
to
their
cheeks
in
order
to
discuss
the
situation
with
a
new
if
fleeting
animation
as
he
passed
them
to
descend
the
platform
steps
to
the
muddy
country
road
loveland
caught
the
words
show
folks
show
folks
yes
he
was
one
of
the
show
folks
chapter
the
dignity
and
delight
of
being
a
juvenile
lead
show
folks
show
folks
say
come
look
at
the
show
men
impish
little
boys
and
girls
yelled
to
each
other
taking
up
the
refrain
from
cottage
to
cottage
along
the
roadside
on
that
via
dolorosa
which
led
to
the
town
of
modunk
loveland
pricked
all
over
as
if
with
a
million
stabs
of
tiny
pins
but
jacobus
only
laughed
and
said
that
it
was
a
good
advertisement
business
had
been
bad
during
the
week
at
modunk
which
would
come
to
an
end
that
night
saturday
but
he
attributed
this
ill
luck
to
the
fact
that
the
company
had
been
forced
for
lack
of
a
juvenile
lead
to
choose
plays
which
were
not
the
most
popular
in
their
repertoire
things
would
be
different
next
week
he
hoped
when
they
were
going
across
the
river
into
kentucky
to
a
small
but
lively
show
town
whence
the
sent
encouraging
accounts
he
questioned
loveland
sharply
concerning
his
theatrical
experience
seeming
to
incline
towards
distrust
since
the
incident
of
the
travelling
bag
very
soon
he
found
out
in
all
its
nakedness
the
truth
which
had
been
veiled
in
the
letter
dictated
by
bill
that
perceval
experience
had
all
been
as
an
amateur
and
not
very
extensive
at
that
however
as
bill
had
prophesied
he
did
not
appear
to
think
it
mattered
much
though
he
sniffed
and
hum
a
little
by
way
of
curbing
the
new
man
you
got
a
good
stage
presence
and
voice
said
he
though
i
do
know
what
the
folks
here
will
think
of
that
english
accent
of
yours
pity
you
ca
talk
united
states
they
mighty
sharp
at
guying
anything
foreign
or
affected
so
do
be
knocked
silly
if
the
little
boys
in
the
dime
seats
mock
you
a
bit
just
keep
your
hair
on
and
go
along
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
they
shut
up
in
a
minute
or
so
when
they
got
used
to
you
this
was
as
bill
would
have
said
a
new
proposition
to
loveland
that
he
had
an
english
accent
which
might
be
objected
to
on
the
ground
of
affectation
he
had
heard
a
good
deal
in
england
about
the
american
accent
and
had
chaffed
jim
harborough
because
of
it
but
as
after
all
the
english
nation
had
more
or
less
invented
the
language
current
on
both
sides
of
the
water
he
had
supposed
that
theirs
was
without
question
the
only
right
way
of
using
it
however
opinion
seemed
to
differ
over
here
and
he
did
not
choose
to
argue
with
jacobus
the
watched
his
new
acquisition
furtively
as
he
plowed
through
the
mud
and
at
last
interrupted
himself
in
describing
with
some
acerbity
the
absent
members
of
the
company
to
remark
suddenly
you
look
like
a
soldier
i
am
a
soldier
loveland
replied
before
he
stopped
to
think
oh
said
jacobus
regarding
him
keenly
english
army
of
course
yes
answered
val
shortly
regretting
his
frankness
h
what
were
you
sergeant
loveland
could
have
broken
out
into
savage
laughter
he
a
lieutenant
in
the
grenadier
guards
asked
by
this
seedy
theatrical
man
if
he
were
a
sergeant
but
he
kept
his
countenance
for
fear
of
committing
himself
unwittingly
under
the
catechismal
fire
no
i
was
a
sergeant
he
replied
h
see
here
i
hope
you
did
leave
the
army
er
on
short
notice
eh
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
mean
am
i
a
deserter
loveland
flashed
out
turning
red
well
excuse
me
if
i
offensive
but
the
arm
of
edward
is
supposed
to
be
a
long
one
if
any
of
his
red
coats
take
a
vacation
without
permission
and
do
want
to
get
into
no
trouble
with
kings
we
may
not
be
noo
york
stars
but
we
a
pretty
respectable
crowd
take
us
all
round
well
set
your
mind
at
rest
said
loveland
swallowing
his
wrath
not
a
deserter
and
i
sha
bring
disgrace
upon
your
company
all
right
all
right
i
take
your
word
for
it
i
guess
nothing
else
to
do
as
you
the
only
man
on
the
spot
but
say
the
more
i
look
at
you
the
more
i
have
a
kind
of
sneaking
idea
i
seen
your
picture
lately
did
you
get
your
photo
stuck
in
any
of
the
theatrical
papers
since
you
landed
no
loveland
replied
but
flushed
again
instantly
guessing
where
and
in
what
connection
jacobus
must
have
seen
his
portrait
a
sketch
or
some
snapshot
perhaps
evidently
the
man
did
not
yet
associate
him
with
anything
in
particular
but
the
connection
between
the
new
juvenile
lead
and
a
certain
englishman
made
notorious
by
one
or
two
new
york
papers
might
at
any
instant
link
itself
in
jacobus
head
this
loveland
was
far
from
desiring
not
that
he
thought
his
value
to
the
management
would
be
decreased
by
the
discovery
rather
the
contrary
judging
by
his
experience
with
alexander
but
because
he
could
not
bear
to
repeat
that
experience
luckily
jacobus
did
not
pursue
the
subject
which
apparently
interested
him
less
than
others
when
he
had
described
the
members
of
his
company
according
to
his
own
conception
of
their
characters
and
social
status
he
went
on
to
tell
the
new
recruit
something
about
the
parts
he
would
be
required
to
play
then
it
was
that
loveland
learned
the
esoteric
difference
between
being
a
leading
man
and
a
juvenile
lead
jack
jacobus
was
himself
it
seemed
leading
man
for
miss
lillie
de
lisle
the
little
human
flower
heavy
lead
he
called
it
but
to
the
heavy
lead
apparently
belonged
all
the
really
good
parts
in
the
company
repertoire
their
productions
struck
loveland
as
being
wonderfully
good
for
a
strolling
troupe
playing
week
by
week
in
extremely
small
towns
but
jacobus
laughed
when
he
remarked
that
it
must
be
expensive
to
obtain
the
rights
of
such
popular
pieces
as
sidney
cremer
for
instance
and
to
put
them
on
the
stage
properly
properly
he
echoed
grinning
well
that
depends
folks
here
perticular
about
scenery
they
do
travel
and
do
have
no
chance
to
see
anything
better
than
we
give
i
guess
i
may
as
well
let
you
into
the
secrets
of
the
for
you
one
of
us
now
and
soon
find
out
for
yourself
anyhow
what
we
are
for
good
and
bad
we
carry
six
men
in
our
show
counting
me
and
you
and
there
ai
many
pieces
we
put
on
except
sidney
cremer
comedies
where
there
less
than
a
dozen
or
fifteen
male
characters
sometimes
more
we
all
double
sometimes
each
one
of
us
even
me
the
leading
man
because
i
proud
and
needs
must
when
somebody
drives
manages
to
do
two
or
three
small
parts
besides
his
own
it
takes
it
out
of
us
but
it
all
in
the
night
work
what
characters
we
ca
double
we
leave
out
same
with
the
women
we
carry
four
of
them
counting
lillie
herself
and
they
earn
their
money
you
see
we
bill
popular
pieces
melodramas
and
comedies
mostly
or
we
should
get
no
houses
so
we
ca
choose
plays
with
few
characters
to
please
lazy
actors
as
for
the
rights
to
produce
why
we
do
trouble
ourselves
about
them
any
more
than
we
do
about
the
pasts
of
our
juvenile
leading
gentlemen
it
simply
do
run
to
it
what
we
want
we
take
good
motto
in
this
life
eh
there
are
fellows
make
their
livin
by
writin
down
the
words
and
biz
of
successful
plays
in
shorthand
copyin
out
at
home
and
then
sellin
on
the
sly
to
poor
but
honest
show
folks
like
us
who
must
live
but
ca
afford
luxuries
it
quite
an
industry
the
puritans
call
our
sort
but
it
do
kill
us
or
our
business
and
as
we
always
work
only
the
smallest
towns
which
the
stage
papers
do
touch
it
ai
as
risky
as
you
think
though
once
in
a
way
the
police
do
shove
their
noses
in
where
nobody
wants
them
and
i
confess
i
a
bit
scared
about
sidney
cremer
new
piece
which
we
just
puttin
up
say
you
lookin
kind
o
sick
i
hope
ai
one
of
the
puritans
are
you
do
they
have
shows
of
our
sort
in
your
country
loveland
said
he
really
did
know
but
as
he
hastened
to
add
he
was
not
a
puritan
and
anyhow
jacobus
business
was
his
own
that
gentleman
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
translate
into
words
the
thoughts
his
eyes
had
begun
to
express
perceval
gordon
it
appeared
was
expected
to
play
seven
parts
at
the
least
during
the
season
and
must
be
in
the
first
one
by
that
very
night
it
was
however
but
a
small
rôle
that
of
an
old
man
who
conveniently
expired
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
in
great
agony
it
was
the
manager
explained
a
fat
acting
part
though
there
were
many
lines
to
speak
and
yes
certainly
a
juvenile
lead
was
occasionally
expected
to
play
old
men
or
indeed
to
do
anything
he
was
asked
to
do
and
an
amateur
like
gordon
might
think
himself
jolly
lucky
to
get
varied
experience
under
such
stage
management
as
he
would
find
in
the
human
flower
company
this
particular
piece
a
melodrama
called
the
dead
hand
had
been
chosen
for
the
closing
night
of
the
engagement
at
modunk
because
the
part
for
the
juvenile
lead
was
too
long
or
difficult
to
get
up
in
with
one
rehearsal
which
they
would
have
after
noon
and
indeed
the
dead
hand
was
to
be
that
of
gordon
himself
he
would
appear
as
a
ghost
near
the
end
of
the
last
act
and
wave
the
said
hand
behind
a
gauze
with
strong
turned
upon
it
which
was
the
scene
which
made
the
part
so
fat
also
incidentally
at
a
ball
he
would
be
asked
to
walk
on
as
a
young
gentleman
of
fashion
could
he
waltz
good
then
he
should
have
jacobus
for
his
partner
as
she
liked
a
decent
dancer
in
that
scene
where
she
had
experienced
considerable
trouble
with
awkward
brutes
who
stepped
on
her
party
dress
jacobus
known
professionally
as
miss
thora
moon
was
her
husband
went
on
to
state
miss
de
lisle
leading
lady
who
played
adventuresses
villainesses
and
important
parts
of
that
ilk
to
the
human
flower
soubrettes
and
ingenues
my
wife
had
some
money
when
i
married
her
he
mentioned
with
an
introspective
look
accompanied
by
a
faint
sigh
thus
loveland
was
enabled
to
guess
how
it
was
that
jacobus
might
have
been
induced
to
forget
his
early
for
miss
de
lisle
bill
little
gal
a
bitter
wind
was
blowing
but
exercise
kept
loveland
warm
and
he
did
not
envy
jacobus
the
overcoat
which
the
actor
was
obliged
to
hold
together
with
one
cold
red
hand
as
several
buttons
were
missing
while
he
frantically
seized
the
brim
of
his
silk
hat
with
the
other
each
time
they
turned
a
corner
at
last
they
came
into
the
town
of
modunk
which
consisted
of
one
long
business
thoroughfare
named
of
course
main
street
and
various
other
avenues
sacred
to
the
home
branching
off
from
it
at
right
angles
and
regular
intervals
main
street
was
paved
with
red
brick
and
most
of
the
residence
streets
were
content
with
a
coating
of
tar
or
else
they
wallowed
in
their
native
mud
the
shops
or
stores
as
jacobus
called
them
appeared
depressingly
unattractive
to
loveland
though
they
were
not
inferior
to
those
in
villages
of
the
same
size
in
england
or
scotland
millinery
dry
goods
and
groceries
were
sold
in
the
same
establishments
and
seemed
to
the
uninitiated
eye
to
be
hopelessly
mixed
in
some
of
the
show
windows
most
of
the
private
houses
were
built
of
wood
painted
white
brown
grey
or
pale
green
they
had
outside
shutters
to
the
windows
such
as
loveland
associated
with
southern
france
and
stood
surrounded
with
neat
little
yards
fenced
off
from
each
other
and
publicity
by
painted
or
whitewashed
palings
there
were
however
a
few
more
pretentious
houses
rising
from
among
less
important
neighbours
with
the
air
of
being
mansions
they
were
of
brick
or
stone
but
loveland
liked
the
little
frame
houses
best
and
was
hoping
he
might
be
lodged
in
one
of
them
when
jacobus
stopped
in
main
street
in
front
of
an
ugly
new
building
constructed
of
wood
and
brick
there
was
a
kind
of
veranda
above
which
appeared
a
large
signboard
with
the
words
smith
hotel
in
green
and
gold
letters
here
we
are
said
jacobus
sighing
as
he
looked
at
his
patent
leathers
the
whole
crowd
here
i
show
you
to
your
room
and
by
the
time
you
had
a
wash
if
you
want
it
dinner
be
ready
i
guess
you
be
ready
for
too
what
dinner
at
twelve
asked
loveland
you
bet
they
like
to
give
it
to
us
with
our
breakfast
if
they
could
so
as
to
get
the
work
out
of
the
way
you
find
the
crowd
in
the
and
i
introduce
you
after
dinner
you
can
have
a
look
through
your
part
in
the
dead
hand
if
you
get
through
in
time
everybody
who
on
in
your
scenes
has
a
call
at
the
theatre
for
rehearsal
that
for
one
sharp
loveland
made
no
comment
on
these
announcements
he
walked
into
the
hotel
behind
jacobus
who
being
manager
of
the
company
heavy
lead
and
combined
naturally
marched
in
front
of
the
insignificant
juvenile
who
carried
his
wardrobe
in
his
hand
there
was
a
narrow
uncarpeted
passage
with
an
uncarpeted
and
still
narrower
stairway
leading
steeply
up
to
regions
above
also
there
was
a
strong
nay
smell
of
dinner
which
could
be
all
too
easily
divided
into
its
component
parts
corned
beef
and
cabbage
with
perhaps
a
bodyguard
of
onions
as
they
went
upstairs
the
smell
followed
but
on
the
next
story
began
to
mingle
with
a
suggestion
of
hot
iron
and
unopened
windows
one
more
flight
for
you
explained
jacobus
they
ai
got
too
much
accommodation
here
and
miss
de
lisle
me
and
my
wife
and
the
other
ladies
are
on
this
floor
gentlemen
above
they
continued
to
ascend
and
the
stopped
before
the
first
door
at
the
head
of
the
second
stairway
which
led
to
the
top
story
of
the
hotel
here
you
are
he
said
and
with
a
light
knock
which
was
a
notification
not
a
request
he
flung
the
door
open
on
a
narrow
bed
visible
from
the
threshold
a
young
man
hardly
more
than
a
boy
was
stretched
reading
something
that
looked
like
mss
he
glanced
round
but
did
not
move
on
seeing
jacobus
and
a
stranger
i
thought
you
said
this
was
my
room
exclaimed
loveland
startled
so
it
is
and
there
your
did
know
whether
you
be
in
ed
i
can
introduce
you
to
each
other
right
now
ed
binney
our
property
man
prompter
and
second
villain
perceval
gordon
of
england
our
new
juvenile
now
you
know
each
other
and
i
guess
eddy
you
can
put
gordon
up
to
all
he
needs
to
know
this
was
worse
than
the
bat
hotel
where
each
man
who
earned
cents
could
have
his
own
cubicle
but
now
loveland
was
not
paying
his
own
way
the
management
was
to
do
that
and
feed
him
too
as
he
had
but
a
quarter
in
the
world
thrust
upon
him
as
a
loan
or
gift
by
generous
bill
loveland
was
not
in
a
position
to
be
critical
here
he
was
and
here
he
would
have
to
stay
till
he
heard
from
home
or
something
turned
up
as
for
hearing
from
home
he
had
begun
almost
to
despair
for
his
two
cables
had
remained
unanswered
now
these
many
dreary
days
still
after
an
interval
of
more
waiting
for
a
telegram
from
his
mother
he
had
written
to
her
and
to
betty
harborough
ashamed
to
take
outsiders
into
the
deepest
secrets
of
his
humiliating
adventures
but
at
best
it
would
be
a
fortnight
before
bill
willing
could
forward
to
some
address
yet
to
be
given
a
letter
from
across
the
sea
and
meanwhile
loveland
was
a
slave
of
necessity
if
not
of
jack
jacobus
that
gentleman
having
acquitted
himself
of
his
duty
to
the
juvenile
lead
disappeared
banging
the
door
leaving
the
old
occupant
and
the
new
occupant
of
the
mean
bare
room
to
make
each
other
acquaintance
binney
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
get
up
as
the
juvenile
lead
was
no
guest
of
his
but
he
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
and
observed
loveland
with
an
interest
that
might
or
might
not
develop
into
friendliness
he
was
thin
pale
and
but
he
had
bright
eyes
almost
too
bright
for
health
and
a
firm
chin
for
a
moment
val
resented
the
youth
existence
so
keenly
that
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
but
brief
reflection
reminded
him
that
after
all
he
was
the
intruder
a
short
time
ago
he
would
have
been
intolerant
of
circumstances
even
less
disagreeable
such
as
finding
himself
forced
to
share
a
cabin
on
shipboard
or
a
compartment
after
expecting
to
travel
alone
but
much
water
had
gone
under
the
mill
of
his
pride
since
then
and
besides
he
had
learned
greatly
to
his
own
surprise
that
kindly
agreeable
human
beings
can
be
found
in
the
lowest
classes
and
queerest
circumstances
ed
binney
looked
as
though
he
might
have
pleasant
qualities
if
approached
in
the
right
way
so
with
amazing
loveland
refrained
even
from
the
mild
insult
of
a
disgusted
glance
he
said
in
his
nice
voice
that
he
hoped
binney
would
mind
his
coming
as
he
really
could
help
himself
whereupon
binney
grinned
showing
teeth
white
as
a
girl
and
replied
that
if
it
were
gordon
it
would
be
someone
else
who
might
be
worse
as
it
struck
binney
that
gordon
would
at
least
be
fond
of
washing
himself
to
this
gordon
responded
that
there
were
few
things
he
liked
better
but
it
seemed
as
if
there
would
be
much
opportunity
at
smith
hotel
you
had
to
do
it
in
sections
with
a
washbowl
said
binney
but
never
mind
you
got
there
just
the
same
if
you
were
in
earnest
then
they
both
laughed
and
binney
exclaimed
with
evident
relief
that
he
was
jolly
glad
gordon
was
the
sort
of
boy
who
put
on
airs
he
been
afraid
at
first
sight
that
was
the
kind
he
was
but
now
he
guessed
it
was
all
the
high
collar
the
feeling
was
for
low
in
miss
de
company
yet
he
did
know
but
those
stove
pipe
ones
had
a
sort
of
style
about
then
he
bounced
off
his
tremulous
cot
which
had
a
patchwork
quilt
somewhat
the
worse
for
contact
with
his
boots
and
was
the
twin
of
another
little
bed
in
a
far
corner
he
showed
his
the
ropes
in
other
words
which
bureau
drawers
were
at
the
newcomer
disposition
where
he
had
better
keep
his
toothbrush
and
so
on
he
confided
to
loveland
the
fact
that
he
himself
had
not
been
long
in
the
company
but
had
come
from
a
better
one
which
he
would
now
regret
if
the
one
night
stands
had
not
been
too
much
for
his
strength
if
your
lungs
are
always
playing
you
tricks
you
have
to
put
up
with
for
at
least
they
give
you
week
stands
and
most
of
the
hotels
throw
in
fires
free
he
explained
i
can
see
that
stepped
down
in
the
world
a
bit
too
so
we
ought
to
have
a
fellow
feelin
for
each
other
while
loveland
made
himself
presentable
for
the
early
dinner
ed
binney
went
on
to
sketch
the
members
of
the
crowd
though
in
a
manner
very
different
from
the
manager
sarcastic
descriptive
efforts
he
said
that
jacobus
was
a
tyrant
and
a
bully
but
that
he
could
act
that
everyone
except
miss
moon
was
afraid
of
and
she
would
be
afraid
of
an
indian
chief
on
the
war
path
that
miss
de
lisle
did
dare
say
her
soul
was
her
own
or
that
black
was
black
if
old
jack
remarked
that
it
was
that
jacobus
had
done
a
very
good
thing
for
himself
in
getting
hold
of
lillie
as
a
star
although
she
had
no
money
for
she
was
a
peach
a
live
wire
just
the
sort
of
little
gal
to
be
a
go
at
towns
like
this
folks
are
wild
about
her
she
as
pretty
and
as
dainty
as
they
make
a
whole
haystack
above
what
they
generally
see
in
these
barns
went
on
ed
but
she
needs
managin
and
gee
jack
and
his
wife
do
manage
her
but
the
old
girl
jealous
i
do
know
how
long
the
show
will
last
for
if
she
says
stop
jack
stops
you
bet
he
as
scared
of
her
as
everybody
else
is
of
she
runs
the
shebang
and
there
two
of
her
sons
by
her
first
husband
in
it
they
ca
act
and
they
ca
look
but
by
gum
they
good
to
their
mother
into
the
midst
of
his
discourse
crashed
a
ferocious
and
in
sheer
they
rushed
downstairs
in
the
hope
of
stopping
the
clamour
by
their
presence
the
opened
off
the
long
passage
on
the
ground
floor
and
already
other
members
of
the
company
had
assembled
for
the
midday
meal
which
must
be
eaten
in
haste
before
the
rehearsal
jacobus
was
there
in
the
act
of
sitting
down
between
two
ladies
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
but
seeing
loveland
he
condescended
to
summon
him
with
a
gesture
chapter
bill
star
val
could
have
laughed
aloud
as
he
imagined
the
old
self
of
a
few
weeks
since
the
young
and
popular
self
obeying
the
beckoning
finger
of
such
a
man
but
he
walked
towards
it
like
a
lamb
and
was
introduced
to
jacobus
miss
moon
and
miss
de
lisle
as
star
of
the
company
miss
de
lisle
ought
of
course
to
have
come
first
but
miss
moon
the
heavy
lead
heavy
in
more
senses
than
one
was
not
a
lady
to
submit
to
such
distinctions
she
would
probably
have
said
that
lillie
de
lisle
was
a
star
only
because
it
suited
the
convenience
of
and
jacobus
to
head
the
troupe
financed
by
their
money
with
a
pretty
enough
little
soubrette
likely
to
take
the
popular
fancy
miss
moon
first
sweeping
glance
at
the
newcomer
was
one
of
important
condescension
but
seeing
that
he
was
an
extremely
handsome
well
dressed
young
man
with
an
air
and
an
appearance
widely
different
from
the
actors
of
her
acquaintance
past
and
present
her
face
and
manner
changed
instead
of
posing
as
the
manager
wife
she
set
herself
to
vie
with
lillie
de
lisle
in
youthful
charm
as
she
sent
forth
a
radiant
look
to
fascinate
perceval
gordon
she
was
a
big
woman
of
or
three
with
the
splendid
ruin
of
what
had
been
a
fine
figure
an
erectness
of
head
which
partly
concealed
the
existence
of
a
double
chin
a
complexion
spoiled
by
a
love
of
rich
food
and
constant
use
of
powder
singularly
dark
eyes
fringed
with
painted
lashes
and
a
good
deal
of
bright
crimson
hair
edged
with
rusty
brown
at
the
roots
beside
miss
moon
bill
little
gal
looked
like
a
tiny
fishing
boat
bobbing
under
the
lee
of
a
large
schooner
but
she
was
a
pretty
creature
whose
curly
hair
was
naturally
almost
as
golden
as
it
glittered
eyes
which
ought
to
have
been
mischievous
and
merry
but
were
anxious
a
clear
rather
freckled
white
skin
and
the
piquant
nose
and
innocent
smile
of
a
child
these
ladies
were
not
dressed
as
tidily
as
their
best
friends
might
have
wished
but
loveland
had
grown
used
to
isidora
and
did
not
pick
flaws
lightly
they
were
both
very
cordial
to
him
somewhat
it
would
have
seemed
to
jacobus
contemptuous
annoyance
and
then
at
miss
moon
suggestion
ed
binney
introduced
gordon
across
and
down
the
length
of
the
table
to
all
the
other
members
of
the
company
there
were
a
few
diners
in
the
room
commercial
travellers
apparently
but
they
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
and
were
not
addressed
though
they
were
on
nodding
acquaintance
with
several
of
the
actors
and
actresses
the
latter
were
two
in
number
besides
miss
de
lisle
and
jacobus
miss
ruby
clare
whose
mission
was
to
act
small
parts
and
play
the
piano
was
of
the
startled
fawn
order
of
young
female
evidently
not
long
out
of
amateurhood
and
winter
who
had
passed
the
age
when
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
her
maiden
name
for
programmes
she
was
a
reserved
and
woman
who
watched
her
husband
with
short
sidelong
glances
of
anxiety
either
for
his
conduct
or
his
health
as
for
him
he
was
a
thin
dejected
grey
little
man
who
suffered
apparently
from
a
broken
heart
or
a
shattered
digestion
his
lips
worked
and
the
lids
of
his
eyes
which
winked
almost
continually
were
he
seemed
acutely
conscious
of
winter
constant
scrutiny
the
remaining
male
members
of
the
company
were
jacobus
two
sons
tom
and
bob
eccles
they
were
between
twenty
and
and
like
their
mother
though
one
was
fat
with
the
lazy
smile
of
a
buddha
and
the
other
who
through
a
cast
in
his
eye
just
missed
being
handsome
inclined
to
be
truculent
loveland
had
intended
to
take
a
chair
next
his
but
miss
moon
made
a
place
for
him
between
herself
and
buddha
smiling
bob
as
everybody
except
jack
jacobus
and
the
winters
talked
and
joked
continually
it
was
surprising
how
fast
they
ate
the
corned
beef
and
cabbage
the
onions
and
the
tinned
american
corn
which
with
other
eatables
and
uneatables
surrounded
their
plates
in
a
wreath
of
little
earthenware
dishes
disappeared
as
if
by
conjuring
to
be
swiftly
replaced
by
and
cheese
that
magically
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
table
in
their
turn
nearly
everyone
drank
large
cupfuls
of
milky
coffee
with
their
dinner
and
twenty
minutes
after
beginning
the
meal
all
had
finished
with
the
exception
of
loveland
who
was
not
accustomed
to
giving
his
food
such
short
shrift
he
rose
with
the
others
however
and
a
few
moments
later
the
company
was
straggling
in
a
procession
to
the
theatre
but
after
all
it
was
not
a
theatre
and
even
courtesy
gave
it
no
more
high
sounding
name
than
hall
it
stood
at
the
end
of
main
street
its
brick
front
wall
plastered
with
wonderful
coloured
posters
representing
the
most
sensational
scenes
in
the
human
flower
repertoire
to
reach
the
stage
it
was
necessary
to
mount
a
long
staircase
and
to
pass
through
the
auditorium
as
for
dressing
rooms
they
did
not
exist
for
it
had
been
a
second
thought
of
some
town
council
to
turn
the
hall
into
a
place
where
theatrical
representations
might
lawfully
be
produced
but
a
space
on
either
side
of
the
stage
had
been
curtained
off
with
sheets
shawls
and
squares
of
canvas
ingeniously
coaxed
to
hold
together
these
screens
reached
unevenly
from
to
twelve
inches
of
the
floor
and
at
worst
an
actor
in
dressing
himself
could
be
seen
no
higher
than
the
knees
unless
perhaps
a
too
bright
light
behind
the
partition
might
reveal
his
whole
person
loveland
was
anxious
to
talk
with
the
star
about
her
old
friend
if
not
love
bill
willing
and
he
had
hoped
on
starting
to
walk
by
her
side
but
miss
moon
seeing
his
desire
had
instantly
frustrated
it
by
calling
him
and
beginning
to
talk
of
the
part
he
was
about
to
rehearse
as
old
dave
dreadnought
he
was
supposed
to
curse
her
with
menaces
and
he
felt
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
do
so
realistically
even
in
the
character
of
loveland
but
he
contrived
to
listen
politely
if
coldly
to
the
story
of
her
first
marriage
at
the
early
age
of
fifteen
i
not
quite
sixteen
years
older
than
my
eldest
son
who
is
over
twenty
now
she
said
and
did
not
look
pleased
when
the
juvenile
lead
found
no
more
tactful
comment
than
an
is
it
possible
on
the
stage
he
received
the
short
part
of
dave
dreadnought
which
jacobus
had
not
after
all
been
able
to
unearth
before
and
was
allowed
to
glance
it
over
while
the
scene
of
his
dying
curse
was
being
set
he
was
too
inexperienced
to
remember
what
in
gay
amateur
days
he
had
learned
of
stage
directions
and
jacobus
was
inclined
to
be
sarcastic
at
his
expense
but
both
miss
moon
and
miss
de
lisle
as
well
as
ed
binney
befriended
him
whispering
hurriedly
what
down
centre
up
left
take
the
stage
or
wait
on
the
prompt
side
meant
and
thanks
to
their
good
nature
he
got
on
reasonably
well
he
was
called
upon
also
to
rehearse
the
ball
scene
where
he
walked
on
as
a
young
man
of
fashion
and
had
the
privilege
of
dancing
with
miss
moon
before
dwindling
in
the
last
act
to
a
mere
dead
hand
all
the
business
had
to
be
repeated
again
and
again
until
at
last
he
was
confident
and
the
stage
manager
almost
hopeful
it
was
five
by
the
time
jacobus
snapped
irritably
to
do
anyhow
but
as
afternoon
tea
was
not
a
custom
in
the
human
flower
company
they
missed
little
by
absence
from
the
hotel
still
loveland
had
found
no
chance
for
a
private
word
with
lillie
who
remained
ignorant
of
his
acquaintance
with
bill
willing
at
six
a
meal
which
called
itself
supper
was
ready
and
having
bolted
a
cold
edition
of
dinner
eked
out
with
tinned
peaches
and
cups
of
tea
actors
and
actresses
marched
forth
in
a
body
to
begin
the
evening
work
the
curtain
did
not
rise
until
half
past
seven
but
this
was
saturday
night
and
the
town
was
eager
for
its
entertainment
the
young
girls
and
their
escorts
liked
nothing
better
than
to
see
the
show
men
and
women
walk
past
them
up
the
hall
on
the
way
to
that
thrilling
region
known
as
behind
the
scenes
therefore
at
least
a
score
of
persons
were
seated
in
the
dismal
auditorium
munching
apples
or
candy
and
cracking
peanuts
when
the
human
flower
and
her
company
filed
in
a
few
little
boys
on
the
cheap
benches
at
the
back
whistled
clapped
their
hands
stamped
on
the
floor
and
made
cat
calls
as
a
greeting
to
the
players
but
those
saluted
took
no
notice
and
skurried
by
like
hunted
things
miss
clare
hastened
to
her
seat
at
the
piano
near
which
an
elderly
quadroon
had
already
begun
to
tune
a
fiddle
and
melancholy
winter
remained
at
the
door
to
help
the
ticket
seller
until
it
should
be
time
for
him
to
make
up
as
the
millionaire
parent
the
gentlemen
of
the
company
loveland
had
already
learned
that
they
never
spoke
of
each
other
as
mere
men
dressed
behind
one
partition
the
ladies
behind
another
and
the
crowding
could
scarcely
have
been
worse
in
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
nevertheless
everyone
was
more
or
less
good
natured
costumes
of
a
sort
and
odds
and
ends
of
grease
paints
were
offered
to
loveland
who
to
his
own
surprise
was
shaking
and
perspiring
oddly
with
stage
fright
what
rot
he
roughly
scolded
himself
as
if
an
audience
in
a
country
village
mattered
what
do
i
care
whether
or
not
i
know
my
part
or
what
they
think
of
me
but
the
queer
fact
remained
that
he
did
care
and
his
heart
thumped
faster
than
it
had
thumped
when
he
was
roused
one
dark
night
to
fight
his
first
battle
as
he
saw
what
personable
looking
men
his
companions
became
after
manipulating
a
few
bits
of
putting
on
wigs
and
stage
costumes
he
began
in
spite
of
himself
to
take
this
queer
theatrical
engagement
of
his
more
seriously
he
wanted
to
act
well
he
wanted
to
please
lillie
de
lisle
and
to
satisfy
ed
binney
who
was
wishing
him
luck
he
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
on
the
pretty
country
girls
who
had
stared
at
him
with
interest
as
he
passed
through
the
auditorium
there
were
not
nearly
enough
local
stage
hands
employed
in
the
theatre
and
acting
was
not
the
only
work
the
actors
had
to
do
they
helped
place
the
scenery
and
change
the
settings
they
flew
about
like
distracted
demons
half
dressed
with
suspenders
flying
turning
a
burglar
den
into
a
millionaire
and
between
the
bewildering
alterations
of
scene
there
was
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
anyone
foot
how
they
ever
got
themselves
out
of
one
costume
into
another
in
time
how
they
ever
remembered
which
of
their
many
doublings
came
first
which
last
loveland
could
not
conceive
but
standing
in
the
wings
waiting
for
his
own
dreaded
turn
he
was
filled
with
an
increasing
respect
for
the
male
and
female
they
could
act
too
most
of
them
which
seemed
to
him
the
strangest
part
of
all
for
he
had
not
expected
to
find
the
satellites
of
bill
little
star
twinkling
with
the
light
of
talent
as
for
his
own
performance
he
realised
before
it
had
begun
that
such
histrionic
efforts
as
had
won
him
applause
when
an
amateur
in
london
would
not
be
good
enough
to
gain
him
admiration
as
a
professional
in
modunk
it
was
another
thing
when
as
a
handsome
young
soldier
lord
loveland
had
swaggered
easily
about
the
stage
pleased
with
himself
and
pleasing
everyone
else
because
everyone
had
come
with
the
intention
of
being
pleased
here
in
remote
little
modunk
the
audience
was
evidently
far
more
critical
and
if
it
did
like
what
it
saw
it
said
so
audibly
with
a
voice
from
the
cheap
seats
or
at
least
indulged
in
a
prolonged
fit
of
bored
coughing
if
loveland
could
have
gone
on
as
himself
as
jacobus
had
said
he
might
have
captured
the
fancy
of
the
girls
but
as
old
dave
dreadnought
in
a
wild
wig
and
beard
lent
by
pa
winter
the
new
addition
to
the
company
could
conquer
the
audience
only
by
sheer
force
of
acting
fortunately
for
loveland
he
was
not
obliged
to
walk
onto
the
stage
in
answer
to
a
cue
or
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
have
moved
it
was
bad
enough
to
be
discovered
in
the
act
of
being
murdered
and
as
the
moment
came
when
he
would
have
to
make
his
first
speech
his
blood
was
beating
like
a
drum
in
his
temples
his
throat
felt
dry
and
when
his
cue
to
speak
was
given
by
jacobus
with
meaning
emphasis
he
could
only
swallow
and
glare
not
a
word
of
the
carefully
rehearsed
part
could
he
remember
and
involuntarily
looking
out
in
front
a
thing
ed
binney
had
warned
him
not
to
do
it
seemed
as
if
the
rows
of
faces
down
below
the
yellow
footlights
were
leaping
up
at
him
like
a
wave
if
he
had
seen
the
mocking
grins
or
heard
the
titters
which
his
morbid
fears
and
exaggerated
sensitiveness
led
him
to
expect
he
would
have
collapsed
into
gasping
helplessness
and
died
without
giving
the
famous
curse
on
which
the
rest
of
the
play
depended
but
to
his
intense
almost
agonising
relief
the
eyes
staring
up
at
him
were
eager
excited
the
people
were
taking
him
in
earnest
they
were
not
laughing
at
him
he
had
power
over
them
and
suddenly
he
felt
able
to
make
use
of
it
just
as
jacobus
bent
over
him
frantically
glaring
ready
to
prompt
and
swear
at
the
same
time
loveland
frozen
hesitation
melted
into
words
and
gestures
the
right
words
the
right
gestures
jacobus
sighed
a
great
sigh
of
thanksgiving
and
val
delivered
his
curse
with
a
transport
of
zeal
he
was
half
frightened
at
his
own
explosiveness
but
the
audience
enjoyed
it
and
when
the
curtain
went
down
upon
his
death
there
was
a
round
of
applause
from
the
audience
they
liked
it
all
right
said
miss
moon
are
they
doing
that
for
me
loveland
asked
incredulously
why
of
course
she
replied
you
were
the
star
of
the
scene
it
would
have
to
be
a
mighty
rotten
dave
not
to
get
a
few
hands
on
his
curse
said
jacobus
never
saw
one
yet
bad
enough
for
that
it
the
scene
not
the
actor
they
clap
but
even
this
cold
douche
did
not
depress
loveland
though
dead
as
dave
it
was
his
business
to
rise
again
in
the
third
act
as
a
young
man
of
fashion
a
youthful
butterfly
from
an
ancient
chrysalis
and
drunk
with
the
sweet
draught
of
triumph
he
made
the
change
gaily
as
happy
for
the
moment
as
if
he
were
playing
before
an
audience
of
kings
and
queens
he
had
dressed
and
was
lurking
in
the
wings
again
watching
with
some
interest
the
arrest
of
the
leading
man
for
his
loveland
murder
on
false
evidence
snakily
given
by
ed
binney
when
miss
de
lisle
flitted
noiselessly
up
very
insufficiently
disguised
as
a
boy
i
suppose
you
remember
that
you
a
young
english
lord
she
whispered
anxiously
loveland
started
and
stared
had
she
found
him
out
in
your
next
scene
she
explained
oh
said
loveland
relieved
am
i
er
a
lord
yes
did
jacobus
tell
you
but
perhaps
he
thought
it
did
matter
it
does
seem
to
retorted
val
smiling
faintly
at
his
own
hidden
meaning
you
supposed
to
be
the
son
of
the
duke
of
highgate
pa
winter
the
duke
you
know
of
course
though
you
have
seen
the
whole
play
yet
only
your
own
scenes
so
you
ca
keep
track
of
everything
you
only
have
to
walk
on
or
rather
on
with
miss
moon
you
know
and
when
she
goes
off
and
i
come
on
in
girl
clothes
again
you
must
say
the
next
is
mine
i
believe
with
an
english
drawl
but
the
down
on
the
program
as
william
vane
by
jove
i
know
willy
vane
he
in
the
black
wa
began
loveland
but
he
bit
his
lip
and
broke
off
abruptly
the
human
flower
laughed
i
do
suppose
friend
a
lord
though
loveland
did
not
reply
as
the
choice
lay
between
a
fib
and
an
affirmative
you
ought
to
know
how
lords
behave
more
than
any
of
us
went
on
the
girl
as
you
an
englishman
i
suppose
you
seen
some
yes
a
few
said
val
cautiously
did
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
speak
to
one
now
and
then
were
they
very
haughty
not
all
of
them
well
as
you
seen
them
you
know
just
how
to
act
and
you
real
swell
this
is
an
exciting
play
ai
it
and
my
how
it
does
makes
us
all
work
this
is
my
only
quiet
time
and
i
guess
you
tired
perhaps
you
rather
watch
jack
jacobus
big
scene
than
talk
to
me
i
have
to
go
on
anyhow
in
about
four
minutes
i
rather
talk
to
you
than
watch
if
you
let
me
said
val
well
as
long
as
you
do
make
yourself
too
interesting
so
i
miss
my
cue
will
be
cross
if
he
sees
us
whispering
here
but
he
too
taken
up
with
himself
and
his
wife
in
this
scene
to
notice
much
that
lucky
because
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
an
old
friend
of
yours
that
i
been
wanting
to
tell
you
all
day
loveland
began
hastily
not
to
waste
one
of
the
four
minutes
i
wonder
if
you
remember
him
bill
willing
bill
willing
a
friend
of
the
girl
spoke
sharply
in
her
surprise
then
you
have
forgotten
him
forgotten
him
i
never
will
to
my
dying
day
her
voice
quivered
a
little
for
like
most
actresses
of
her
type
her
emotions
were
as
easily
played
upon
as
those
are
almost
the
words
he
used
about
you
said
loveland
interested
in
lillie
part
of
the
broken
love
melody
as
he
had
been
in
bill
only
his
were
stronger
what
were
they
exactly
shall
i
tell
you
really
yes
quick
quick
he
said
he
always
loved
you
and
always
would
love
you
till
his
dying
day
oh
lillie
de
lisle
gulped
down
a
small
sob
i
thought
he
forgotten
all
about
me
long
long
ago
he
never
wrote
no
he
told
me
he
did
dare
or
something
like
that
but
he
resist
sending
a
message
by
me
if
you
what
it
is
to
me
to
hear
from
him
again
how
in
the
world
did
you
meet
him
but
that
was
a
long
story
and
before
loveland
could
begin
to
sketch
it
the
human
flower
heard
her
cue
with
professional
instinct
she
darted
out
of
the
entrance
on
to
the
stage
and
took
up
her
part
as
if
she
had
thought
of
nothing
else
since
she
laid
it
down
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
third
act
that
there
was
the
smallest
chance
to
continue
the
talk
so
suddenly
broken
short
loveland
had
to
change
back
again
into
the
beard
wig
and
bloodstained
clothes
of
murdered
dave
dreadnought
in
order
to
appear
as
a
ghost
and
wave
his
dead
hand
under
the
remorseful
villain
nose
but
this
act
of
retribution
was
reserved
for
the
end
of
the
play
therefore
encouraged
by
lillie
val
stood
half
concealed
in
the
shadow
of
some
disused
scenery
talking
of
bill
to
bill
star
he
told
her
of
bill
dog
shakespeare
the
tiny
creature
who
made
up
a
bit
for
the
lost
gal
he
told
her
how
bill
generally
contrived
to
put
aside
a
dime
each
week
to
buy
a
stage
paper
solely
in
the
hope
of
finding
news
of
her
he
described
bill
delight
at
hearing
that
she
had
become
a
star
with
her
own
company
and
explained
how
it
was
by
bill
wish
and
advice
that
he
had
written
to
ask
for
his
present
engagement
if
only
it
my
company
really
sighed
the
poor
little
star
would
i
just
send
for
bill
to
come
out
but
i
have
got
any
more
say
than
the
property
man
and
used
to
hate
bill
because
because
he
was
jealous
you
see
that
was
before
jacobus
married
oh
since
you
a
friend
of
bill
and
he
told
you
he
cared
about
me
i
can
talk
to
you
as
if
i
known
you
for
ever
if
bill
had
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
would
in
a
minute
but
he
never
did
i
was
sure
he
ever
really
cared
till
what
you
said
tonight
he
was
the
best
man
i
ever
knew
i
not
sure
he
is
the
best
i
ever
knew
too
said
loveland
i
have
sooner
with
him
than
be
a
queen
with
a
crown
on
my
head
if
he
was
the
king
sighed
miss
de
lisle
do
feel
that
way
too
about
love
yes
loveland
answered
i
did
always
but
then
i
used
not
to
understand
it
too
late
now
bill
star
went
on
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
the
words
echoed
in
loveland
head
too
late
now
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
the
human
flower
thoughts
were
far
away
with
bill
willing
but
at
least
she
knew
where
he
was
and
was
sure
that
he
loved
her
while
val
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
place
near
louisville
where
lesley
dearmer
lived
and
he
was
sure
that
she
did
not
love
him
yes
he
was
sure
of
that
though
perhaps
there
was
a
time
he
told
himself
when
he
might
have
made
her
care
instead
of
trying
to
win
her
when
he
had
the
chance
he
had
asked
her
advice
about
the
best
way
of
making
love
to
other
girls
oh
he
deserved
all
he
had
got
he
thought
with
sudden
fury
all
even
to
being
a
waiter
at
alexander
and
a
leading
juvenile
under
the
management
of
j
j
chapter
a
mysterious
disappearance
gordon
come
to
our
room
directly
after
dinner
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
miss
moon
not
a
word
to
anyone
mind
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
with
an
air
of
mystery
stopping
loveland
on
the
stairs
and
then
passing
with
a
significant
look
and
a
finger
on
her
lips
as
a
door
shut
sharply
somewhere
above
of
course
she
took
it
for
granted
that
he
would
accept
the
royal
invitation
which
was
a
command
and
did
not
need
an
answer
equally
of
course
loveland
knew
that
he
would
be
knocking
at
the
door
at
the
moment
desired
though
he
was
puzzled
by
the
request
and
the
secretive
way
in
which
it
was
made
it
was
only
a
week
that
day
since
he
had
joined
the
company
but
the
longest
week
of
his
life
save
one
already
the
time
when
he
had
not
been
a
country
actor
seemed
distant
he
was
old
man
or
dear
boy
with
all
the
men
except
jacobus
and
gordon
with
the
actresses
he
had
heard
the
of
almost
everyone
among
his
comrades
male
and
female
knew
why
by
evil
fate
or
mere
fluke
they
had
lost
splendid
and
chances
of
gracing
metropolitan
theatres
had
grown
to
look
upon
them
all
even
buddha
as
fellow
beings
and
was
doing
his
worried
wearied
best
with
seven
new
parts
committed
to
memory
in
as
many
days
if
lesley
dearmer
were
an
actress
and
it
were
her
company
instead
of
lillie
de
lisle
he
said
to
himself
how
happy
he
could
be
in
spite
of
all
hardships
for
the
longing
to
see
lesley
was
never
absent
he
regretted
her
desperately
and
the
chance
he
might
have
had
with
her
the
chance
he
had
thrown
away
he
dreamed
of
her
at
night
instead
of
living
his
troubles
over
again
and
in
involved
fancies
often
saw
her
acting
with
him
on
the
stage
in
the
place
of
bill
little
gal
always
she
seemed
near
always
she
was
in
his
thoughts
but
perhaps
this
was
partly
because
someone
had
mentioned
incidentally
that
ashville
where
the
company
was
playing
now
lay
only
about
thirty
miles
from
louisville
somewhere
near
louisville
she
lived
and
if
he
were
lord
loveland
with
money
in
his
pocket
even
a
little
money
instead
of
being
just
a
strolling
actor
named
gordon
with
two
suits
of
clothes
to
his
back
he
would
have
tried
his
hardest
to
find
her
he
no
longer
regretted
the
hopelessness
of
finding
favour
in
the
eyes
of
american
heiresses
because
he
was
homesick
for
the
light
in
lesley
sweet
eyes
the
only
woman
eyes
that
had
ever
mattered
seriously
to
him
except
his
mother
nothing
had
happened
really
to
make
money
of
less
importance
to
him
rather
the
other
way
yet
money
did
not
seem
as
important
as
it
had
and
he
told
himself
that
he
was
well
punished
for
not
asking
lesley
to
marry
him
but
now
he
had
let
her
learn
to
despise
him
and
being
gordon
the
instead
of
lord
loveland
he
would
have
avoided
a
meeting
with
the
girl
if
it
had
come
in
his
way
he
could
not
have
endured
to
be
seen
by
her
as
he
was
now
and
even
should
his
luck
change
as
it
must
before
long
with
news
from
home
there
would
still
remain
between
them
as
a
barrier
lesley
scorn
of
him
which
he
had
taught
her
to
feel
and
her
knowledge
of
all
his
ridiculous
adventures
what
a
contrast
to
the
pictures
he
had
painted
for
her
of
his
reception
in
america
with
her
impish
sense
of
fun
the
humorous
side
of
his
welcome
by
new
yorkers
must
have
appealed
to
her
intensely
he
was
sure
and
he
did
not
think
that
even
when
he
ceased
to
be
gordon
lesley
dearmer
would
ever
care
to
think
of
him
seriously
again
she
had
been
very
frank
that
last
morning
on
the
and
many
times
since
he
had
recalled
every
word
she
had
said
to
him
as
they
leaned
on
the
rail
watching
the
ship
draw
into
the
new
york
dock
lesley
would
feel
as
he
began
to
but
even
more
that
everything
which
had
happened
served
him
right
he
could
almost
hear
her
pronouncing
sentence
smiling
yet
in
earnest
how
she
must
have
laughed
at
his
fallen
pride
and
the
wildly
farcical
things
such
merry
humourists
as
tony
kidd
had
doubtless
put
into
the
papers
he
had
become
a
mere
figure
of
fun
for
america
and
therefore
for
lesley
dearmer
who
had
never
been
a
respecter
of
persons
and
the
fear
that
the
human
company
might
play
at
louisville
had
been
hot
in
his
mind
until
ed
binney
reassured
him
louisville
was
not
for
the
likes
of
them
and
they
would
never
get
nearer
such
an
important
town
than
they
were
now
soon
they
would
be
out
of
kentucky
and
in
missouri
indeed
the
date
following
ashville
was
in
the
latter
state
and
loveland
had
been
advised
that
his
forthcoming
address
would
be
bonnerstown
only
the
day
before
his
meeting
with
miss
moon
on
the
stairs
he
had
written
to
bill
willing
asking
him
to
send
on
any
mail
to
bonnerstown
missouri
and
now
the
lady
mysterious
summons
gave
him
an
uneasy
moment
he
had
supposed
that
his
acting
was
satisfactory
and
had
worked
hard
over
the
learning
and
rehearsing
of
his
parts
seldom
getting
to
sleep
before
five
in
the
morning
then
dropping
off
with
a
in
his
hand
as
well
as
in
his
head
but
what
if
miss
moon
meant
to
break
the
news
that
j
j
thought
he
could
not
act
well
enough
and
that
he
must
expect
his
discharge
loveland
had
little
appetite
for
dinner
though
the
hotel
at
ashville
was
better
than
at
modunk
and
the
cooking
was
good
southern
cooking
immediately
after
the
meal
he
went
upstairs
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
and
jacobus
room
with
no
feeling
of
strangeness
in
doing
so
because
he
had
learned
since
joining
miss
de
lisle
company
that
for
pros
bedroom
was
another
word
for
parlour
the
stage
manager
and
his
wife
were
both
there
jacobus
smoking
in
sulky
silence
which
he
broke
only
with
a
grunt
by
way
of
greeting
for
the
juvenile
lead
but
miss
moon
made
up
in
cordiality
for
her
husband
coldness
jacobus
is
cross
with
me
she
announced
coquettishly
about
you
about
me
loveland
repeated
puzzled
and
vaguely
uncomfortable
yes
there
an
idea
of
mine
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
and
he
says
you
blab
it
to
the
others
but
say
you
wo
if
you
promise
you
wo
that
so
is
it
of
course
answered
loveland
and
you
do
promise
do
you
and
that
you
wo
say
a
word
to
a
living
soul
if
i
tell
you
a
thing
in
strict
confidence
i
promise
loveland
returned
imprudently
impressed
with
the
idea
that
he
was
to
hear
some
comment
on
his
own
acting
there
that
all
right
then
i
trust
you
yes
i
just
so
there
i
guess
i
have
a
right
to
my
say
in
this
show
have
i
answered
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
but
it
was
a
shrug
of
resentful
acquiescence
and
showed
that
he
acknowledged
his
supremacy
the
eternal
supremacy
of
the
golden
calf
sit
down
and
make
yourself
at
home
went
on
miss
moon
smiling
on
the
handsome
young
man
who
was
not
much
older
than
her
sons
full
moon
was
her
nickname
in
the
company
and
loveland
thought
as
she
cordially
indicated
a
chair
by
the
stove
that
her
figure
merited
the
i
know
you
a
great
friend
of
the
lady
slily
began
again
when
she
and
loveland
were
seated
near
the
fire
and
had
drowned
himself
in
a
theatrical
paper
but
all
the
same
you
must
admit
that
her
acting
gets
worse
every
day
she
so
awful
careless
and
failed
to
go
down
with
audiences
here
we
done
rotten
business
the
house
has
seemed
good
every
night
said
loveland
ah
it
all
right
but
it
been
half
paper
it
mighty
discouragin
for
me
and
jacobus
i
can
tell
you
after
the
money
put
into
the
show
and
the
work
put
in
the
fact
is
so
discouragin
we
thinkin
of
makin
a
change
breakin
up
the
company
in
a
way
and
then
startin
again
with
only
the
ones
we
want
in
a
new
crowd
would
you
like
to
join
loveland
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
with
almost
brutally
frank
disapproval
on
his
the
extra
touches
she
had
given
to
her
hair
and
eyelashes
and
complexion
for
his
benefit
were
all
in
vain
she
might
have
been
a
block
of
painted
wood
for
any
admiration
in
his
eyes
you
mean
you
going
to
send
miss
de
lisle
away
he
asked
we
going
to
send
ourselves
away
from
miss
moon
corrected
him
leaving
her
in
the
lurch
exclaimed
loveland
with
that
uncompromising
truthfulness
of
his
which
was
a
virtue
or
a
vice
according
as
one
had
reason
to
regard
it
the
big
woman
flushed
darkly
through
her
powder
there
no
about
it
she
defended
herself
with
a
new
sharpness
in
her
tone
i
do
intend
to
shell
out
any
more
of
my
good
money
carting
lillie
de
lisle
around
the
country
as
a
star
that
all
i
suppose
i
have
a
right
to
do
as
i
choose
with
my
own
ought
to
complain
i
offering
you
a
chance
that
lots
of
real
actors
would
grab
you
can
go
with
the
new
company
and
have
better
parts
and
better
pay
than
what
getting
now
but
you
have
to
choose
right
away
between
me
between
us
and
lillie
de
lisle
well
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
i
choose
miss
de
lisle
said
loveland
miss
moon
burst
out
laughing
hysterically
there
i
told
you
what
you
get
ejaculated
her
husband
but
she
shook
her
shoulders
angrily
seeming
to
transfer
to
him
all
the
resentment
loveland
had
roused
let
things
alone
ca
you
she
snapped
gordon
only
guying
you
gordon
or
anyhow
you
do
understand
when
i
said
between
us
there
nothing
choose
for
lillie
de
lisle
has
got
a
thing
to
offer
you
and
we
have
a
lot
we
can
bust
her
up
and
when
she
bust
she
is
bust
why
she
has
a
dime
to
bless
herself
with
i
should
think
she
ai
the
savin
kind
and
she
wo
even
have
any
advertisin
paper
to
go
along
with
if
she
wanted
to
go
along
on
her
own
her
name
ai
printed
on
any
of
the
posters
i
took
care
of
that
starting
out
the
slips
with
de
lisle
are
all
separate
joined
on
to
the
posters
with
paste
and
as
for
her
litho
she
welcome
to
she
looks
a
fright
bad
enough
to
scare
crows
the
pictorial
paper
every
sheet
of
it
and
we
can
start
another
show
inside
two
days
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
wire
a
chicago
agent
for
a
new
star
if
i
do
choose
to
do
the
starring
myself
and
as
many
folks
as
we
want
now
you
see
how
things
stand
do
you
i
think
i
do
said
loveland
well
what
do
you
decide
the
same
that
i
decided
before
oh
you
do
do
you
ai
you
silly
you
wo
take
a
good
thing
when
it
offered
you
i
wo
take
the
thing
you
offered
me
she
bounced
up
from
her
chair
her
large
face
flaming
very
well
then
all
i
got
left
to
say
is
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
choice
and
afternoon
good
afternoon
said
loveland
rising
and
walking
towards
the
door
wait
a
minute
exclaimed
miss
moon
stopping
him
as
he
turned
the
handle
see
here
if
you
please
you
no
gentleman
if
you
play
the
sneak
and
tell
i
given
you
my
word
not
to
do
that
loveland
assured
her
mind
you
keep
it
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
cried
the
angry
woman
and
thinking
that
he
might
as
well
take
this
as
his
cue
for
exit
loveland
left
the
room
hell
hath
no
fury
like
a
woman
scorned
he
heard
her
husband
quoting
with
a
vicious
laugh
before
there
had
been
time
to
shut
the
door
loveland
went
up
to
his
own
room
more
than
a
little
troubled
he
had
learned
to
like
lillie
de
lisle
not
only
for
bill
sake
but
for
her
own
she
was
a
sweet
bright
little
creature
a
lady
by
nature
though
not
by
birth
or
education
and
if
she
had
a
chance
might
even
yet
in
spite
of
bad
training
become
a
charming
actress
the
moon
woman
was
jealous
of
the
star
youth
and
prettiness
of
course
and
now
she
meant
to
play
her
rival
a
shameful
trick
yet
he
might
not
warn
the
poor
girl
because
of
that
stupid
promise
he
had
given
it
was
a
new
thing
for
loveland
to
trouble
himself
about
the
affairs
of
his
acquaintances
but
he
knew
too
well
now
what
it
was
like
to
be
deserted
by
friends
by
the
world
not
to
have
learned
how
to
feel
for
others
he
was
genuinely
uncomfortable
about
lillie
but
he
could
only
make
up
his
mind
to
stand
by
the
deposed
star
whatever
happened
to
her
and
to
himself
for
the
present
he
did
not
see
what
else
he
could
do
bound
as
he
was
to
silence
but
there
was
one
comfort
he
consoled
himself
a
new
company
could
not
be
formed
in
a
minute
this
was
saturday
they
would
all
go
on
to
bonnerstown
next
day
no
doubt
perhaps
jacobus
would
reconsider
the
spiteful
decision
to
which
her
henpecked
husband
agreed
with
evident
reluctance
in
any
case
there
were
a
few
days
in
which
to
plan
loveland
hoped
that
he
might
hear
from
england
in
another
week
and
at
worst
salaries
were
payable
on
saturdays
he
would
be
the
possessor
of
ten
hard
earned
dollars
that
night
dinner
had
been
at
twelve
because
of
the
matinée
which
would
begin
at
two
now
it
was
already
after
one
and
everybody
had
started
for
the
theatre
except
himself
the
jacobuses
and
ed
binney
who
was
ill
with
a
racking
cough
and
keeping
his
room
till
the
last
minute
loveland
went
upstairs
to
see
how
ed
was
feeling
found
him
ready
though
coughing
hard
and
they
walked
to
the
ashville
opera
house
together
after
all
salaries
were
not
paid
that
night
informed
the
expectant
members
of
the
company
that
business
had
run
to
it
they
must
wait
for
their
money
till
next
week
bonnerstown
was
a
bigger
place
than
ashville
and
there
was
every
prospect
of
better
things
for
the
future
two
or
three
of
the
actors
and
actresses
wheedled
a
few
dollars
out
of
the
manager
to
go
on
with
but
they
were
old
fakirs
as
they
would
have
said
themselves
and
knew
how
to
manage
such
matters
loveland
however
took
the
news
quietly
as
he
had
begun
to
take
the
various
blows
which
fortune
successively
dealt
him
in
these
small
towns
the
hotel
breakfast
was
from
seven
till
eight
or
until
by
favour
and
on
sundays
if
one
were
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
in
coming
down
nothing
actively
unpleasant
was
said
aloud
though
there
might
be
mumblings
and
dark
looks
on
this
sunday
morning
loveland
availed
himself
of
the
last
amount
of
grace
hurrying
down
at
a
quarter
to
nine
lest
he
should
be
told
grumpily
that
breakfast
was
cleared
away
ed
binney
was
in
bed
for
his
had
volunteered
to
carry
something
up
but
lillie
de
lisle
pa
and
ma
winter
and
miss
clare
were
still
at
the
table
have
the
others
finished
and
gone
already
asked
loveland
for
the
two
eccles
were
usually
the
last
to
appear
unless
it
were
who
invariably
took
his
wife
breakfast
upstairs
before
beginning
his
own
no
it
queer
none
of
them
have
been
down
yet
replied
winter
they
wrote
cards
on
their
doors
saying
they
were
to
be
disturbed
or
their
fires
to
be
made
and
did
want
breakfast
the
cards
are
up
yet
it
the
first
time
they
ever
done
such
a
thing
since
i
knew
and
that
two
years
i
do
hope
they
have
committed
suicide
whispered
miss
clare
who
battened
on
detective
stories
loveland
did
not
offer
any
opinion
but
he
flushed
slightly
on
hearing
the
news
and
went
on
eating
his
lukewarm
breakfast
with
eyebrows
drawn
together
in
an
anxious
frown
could
there
be
any
connection
between
this
mysterious
and
unprecedented
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
manager
his
wife
and
his
wife
family
and
the
secret
proposal
made
yesterday
to
the
juvenile
lead
loveland
had
told
himself
then
that
the
threatening
storm
would
not
break
until
the
following
week
at
earliest
but
now
a
disquieting
idea
had
jumped
into
his
head
so
disquieting
was
it
that
when
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
he
paused
before
the
door
of
the
room
occupied
by
the
eccles
brothers
and
disregarding
the
card
conspicuously
pinned
on
the
panel
knocked
very
hard
no
answer
came
and
he
knocked
again
still
harder
then
a
third
time
so
violently
that
no
natural
sleep
could
have
resisted
the
clamour
by
this
time
the
landlord
the
landlord
son
the
landlord
wife
and
niece
and
several
commercial
travellers
were
in
the
passage
or
on
the
stairs
they
dead
drunk
or
else
they
hooked
it
suggested
one
of
the
latter
scott
jacobus
ai
paid
for
his
week
yet
exclaimed
the
landlord
his
thin
yellow
face
turning
a
shade
yellower
he
rushed
to
the
closed
door
on
the
floor
below
and
pounded
furiously
with
no
result
the
snides
i
hanged
if
they
ai
gallivanted
with
my
money
and
made
me
the
expense
of
bustin
in
my
doors
and
gettin
mended
wailed
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
luckily
for
his
feeling
and
pocket
one
of
the
commercial
travellers
was
an
amateur
locksmith
and
the
door
which
hid
the
secret
of
the
jacobus
family
was
soon
opened
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
the
room
was
clear
of
all
jacobus
belongings
and
the
landlord
reproached
himself
for
not
being
fly
enough
to
suspect
treachery
earlier
he
had
actually
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
jacobus
carrying
bundles
to
the
theatre
when
starting
for
the
matinée
and
again
before
the
evening
performance
but
had
thought
nothing
of
it
because
his
acquaintance
with
jacobus
had
extended
over
several
years
i
was
a
crazy
loon
to
think
he
was
all
right
the
defrauded
man
groaned
and
then
business
was
a
the
whole
week
so
i
was
my
eyes
peeled
for
any
larks
i
big
enough
and
old
enough
and
ought
to
o
known
better
but
the
rest
o
ye
ai
goin
to
take
a
shine
out
o
me
like
that
i
keep
your
hotel
luggage
till
you
hand
over
every
red
cent
of
your
board
and
i
wish
to
goodness
the
law
was
too
cranky
to
give
me
holt
o
your
theatre
trunks
too
i
ca
believe
they
really
gone
and
left
us
like
this
pleaded
the
little
star
and
pale
though
unnaturally
composed
wait
and
see
before
we
think
the
worst
somebody
better
run
over
to
the
opera
house
and
find
out
if
their
things
are
there
if
sneaked
them
away
in
the
night
why
then
i
to
believe
but
i
wo
before
i
guess
my
son
there
and
back
by
this
time
growled
the
landlord
meanwhile
i
just
have
a
go
at
t
other
lock
he
had
the
go
and
by
the
time
the
opening
door
had
revealed
emptiness
bad
news
had
come
back
from
the
theatre
the
worst
had
happened
with
incredible
stealth
and
cunning
the
manager
and
his
family
had
slipped
away
in
the
night
leaving
nothing
behind
them
but
a
stranded
broken
and
penniless
company
chapter
marooned
after
consultation
in
the
room
of
the
star
it
appeared
that
the
funds
of
the
deserted
six
amounted
to
exactly
six
dollars
or
if
equally
divided
one
dollar
apiece
lillie
who
had
been
more
or
less
regularly
in
the
enjoyment
of
thirteen
dollars
a
week
was
in
the
habit
of
sending
all
she
could
spare
out
of
her
salary
to
a
bedridden
sister
in
a
institution
pa
and
winter
were
suspected
of
having
something
up
their
sleeves
but
they
produced
only
two
dollars
to
match
two
and
after
all
their
joint
earnings
were
but
ten
dollars
a
week
as
for
ed
binney
he
supported
parents
one
of
whom
was
almost
blind
the
other
nearly
crippled
with
rheumatism
besides
this
regular
call
upon
his
purse
he
was
obliged
reluctantly
from
time
to
time
to
buy
a
tonic
which
might
keep
his
delicate
chest
in
working
order
miss
clare
was
chronically
penniless
and
everybody
knew
that
gordon
had
received
no
salary
yet
the
landlord
disappointed
at
finding
very
little
of
value
in
the
rooms
of
the
actors
with
whom
it
was
a
cautious
habit
to
safeguard
their
most
cherished
possessions
in
their
theatre
trunks
had
threatened
in
the
first
outburst
of
anger
to
turn
them
all
into
the
street
but
loveland
and
lillie
de
lisle
argued
that
he
would
lose
nothing
by
waiting
an
hour
or
two
until
matters
had
been
discussed
and
something
of
advantage
to
everybody
perhaps
arranged
but
at
the
end
of
a
long
and
gloomy
talk
nobody
had
found
anything
brilliant
to
suggest
there
was
too
little
money
to
be
of
any
use
said
pa
winter
who
was
by
nature
a
pessimist
and
for
his
part
he
did
see
what
was
to
become
of
them
all
unless
they
went
to
the
and
waited
for
something
to
turn
up
or
induced
the
town
authorities
to
organise
a
subscription
i
wo
go
to
the
and
i
wo
be
an
object
of
charity
exclaimed
lillie
pluckily
i
been
in
bad
scrapes
before
and
got
out
of
somehow
and
i
bet
we
all
have
unless
it
gordon
so
i
guess
we
can
again
relieved
by
jacobus
treachery
of
his
obligation
to
be
silent
val
repeated
his
conversation
with
jacobus
yesterday
adding
that
he
had
been
very
far
from
suspecting
her
real
intention
that
because
you
an
amatoor
dear
boy
said
binney
coughing
harshly
if
they
let
out
as
much
to
one
of
but
they
have
had
too
much
gumption
if
only
you
could
have
put
us
wise
we
o
been
on
the
watch
but
do
think
we
blamin
you
for
we
ai
you
did
the
straight
thing
accordin
to
your
lights
full
moon
was
always
green
jealous
of
miss
de
lisle
but
after
you
joined
the
show
if
she
been
a
cat
with
four
legs
instead
of
two
she
o
spit
and
scratched
as
it
was
she
did
the
next
best
thing
tried
to
take
you
away
under
her
arm
and
spite
lillie
for
the
rest
of
us
she
did
care
a
tinker
dash
one
way
or
another
then
when
you
turned
on
her
and
blurted
out
just
what
you
thought
of
her
and
her
schemes
and
how
you
meant
to
stand
by
miss
de
lisle
she
was
as
sour
on
you
as
she
had
been
sweet
i
bet
chucklin
this
minute
thinkin
of
our
plight
it
be
nuts
to
her
ca
we
get
at
them
and
punish
them
somehow
loveland
wanted
to
know
takes
money
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
even
if
we
could
it
would
cost
the
boss
of
the
hotel
more
than
jacobus
owes
him
for
us
all
to
go
to
law
now
they
vamoosed
out
of
the
state
too
as
for
us
we
not
it
except
the
soup
they
had
plenty
of
money
too
the
beasts
for
full
moon
a
regular
oof
bird
with
a
thousand
dollars
of
her
own
over
and
above
what
has
and
the
ashville
business
been
jolly
good
i
do
care
how
they
tried
to
stuff
you
up
they
must
have
lit
out
with
a
pretty
penny
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
scenery
paper
and
plays
we
stripped
clear
of
everything
but
our
theatre
trunks
and
they
have
taken
them
if
they
dared
but
loveland
had
not
even
a
theatre
trunk
if
we
could
get
up
some
kind
of
a
benefit
performance
those
that
are
left
of
us
he
suggested
after
thinking
very
hard
for
a
few
heavy
minutes
we
might
make
enough
to
go
somewhere
good
idea
if
we
had
a
play
said
eddy
but
we
no
by
jinks
we
got
one
what
one
asked
lillie
de
lisle
clasping
her
hands
sidney
cremer
bob
old
gave
me
the
to
copy
into
parts
only
three
days
ago
and
i
was
too
seedy
to
hustle
much
with
it
he
said
if
the
parts
were
ready
to
distribute
monday
it
would
do
and
i
was
going
to
finish
by
then
sure
i
suppose
he
das
ask
me
for
the
back
for
fear
i
smell
a
rat
or
else
he
forgot
anyhow
i
got
the
play
and
half
the
parts
are
done
a
new
play
by
sidney
cremer
ought
to
be
a
draw
even
here
said
lillie
and
bob
is
new
as
new
as
tomorrow
bread
lord
bob
by
sidney
cremer
loveland
remembered
seeing
the
posters
up
in
new
york
and
for
the
last
year
or
two
the
young
american
playwright
name
had
been
well
known
even
in
london
this
piece
loveland
believed
had
been
produced
for
the
very
first
time
on
his
first
night
in
new
york
yet
these
had
got
hold
of
it
he
made
some
remark
that
showed
surprise
and
lillie
laughing
rather
sadly
replied
that
a
new
york
man
with
whom
was
in
touch
had
offered
to
give
him
the
play
cheap
we
do
pay
the
author
anything
she
said
seems
mean
does
it
and
i
suppose
it
a
kind
of
stealing
but
i
been
brought
up
to
it
ever
since
i
was
a
and
we
do
hurt
the
playwright
much
by
producing
his
pieces
in
places
like
our
week
stands
no
company
that
pays
author
fees
comes
here
once
in
a
blue
moon
the
question
is
could
we
put
the
play
on
and
could
we
get
the
opera
house
for
any
nights
this
week
it
was
jacobus
who
knew
all
those
things
not
me
i
was
in
his
hands
and
i
just
let
myself
drift
there
are
only
three
women
two
girls
and
an
old
lady
in
the
play
that
would
suit
all
right
said
eddy
eagerly
as
for
the
men
it
is
quite
so
easy
never
is
but
there
are
only
five
one
a
servant
another
a
policeman
and
there
no
scenery
to
speak
of
i
guess
we
could
fake
i
do
feel
very
grand
but
i
try
and
write
out
the
rest
of
the
parts
by
tonight
in
case
we
can
get
the
theatre
and
bring
the
stunt
off
i
write
out
the
parts
you
have
done
said
loveland
i
find
the
manager
of
the
alleged
opera
house
too
and
have
a
talk
with
him
do
a
real
heart
to
heart
talk
urged
lillie
tell
him
we
mean
sharing
terms
of
course
if
it
really
can
be
fixed
up
it
pretty
sure
the
landlord
keep
us
all
on
spec
loveland
who
was
now
the
only
young
man
of
the
party
and
whose
idea
it
had
been
to
get
up
the
entertainment
went
out
at
once
luckily
catching
the
local
manager
of
the
grandiloquently
named
opera
house
just
as
he
was
virtuously
setting
forth
to
church
jacobus
it
seemed
had
settled
up
all
right
with
him
the
night
before
and
he
was
surprised
to
hear
of
the
flight
but
he
had
his
bride
a
third
bride
with
him
and
feared
that
she
would
not
consider
it
decorous
to
discuss
theatrical
business
in
the
street
on
sunday
on
the
way
to
church
he
would
have
sent
the
show
man
away
rather
cavalierly
without
any
definite
answer
if
the
bride
who
like
an
intelligent
baby
was
already
beginning
to
take
notice
had
not
put
in
a
word
for
the
handsome
young
englishman
i
do
care
if
we
are
five
minutes
late
said
she
conscious
of
a
hat
which
would
receive
the
more
appreciation
if
all
the
other
hats
were
already
in
their
pews
so
the
manager
relented
and
admitted
to
loveland
that
the
house
was
open
for
three
nights
after
that
the
dandy
lady
minstrels
were
coming
to
finish
out
the
week
their
advance
agent
would
arrive
on
monday
without
doubt
and
bill
the
town
so
that
a
makeshift
show
would
stand
much
chance
as
the
opera
house
was
free
however
the
marooned
actors
might
have
their
chance
but
it
was
a
spec
for
him
the
manager
and
ordinary
sharing
terms
were
good
enough
he
stipulated
for
two
thirds
of
the
profits
if
any
above
expenses
and
would
not
unbend
though
the
bride
motioned
her
compassion
for
the
actors
with
lifted
eyebrows
all
the
rest
of
the
day
loveland
was
busy
he
finished
copying
the
parts
which
must
be
learned
and
rehearsed
so
that
the
play
might
be
produced
tomorrow
night
there
was
a
newspaper
in
ashville
which
came
out
once
a
week
and
the
company
decided
after
a
stormy
debate
to
spend
one
of
the
six
dollars
in
buying
from
the
office
large
sheets
or
rolls
of
the
coarse
white
paper
on
which
this
weekly
publication
was
printed
having
secured
a
good
supply
and
obtained
black
paint
and
a
big
brush
from
a
sympathetic
who
was
a
customer
of
the
hotel
loveland
set
to
work
with
binney
aid
and
direction
to
manufacture
some
crude
posters
he
announced
in
black
letters
so
gigantic
as
to
be
almost
convincing
that
the
principal
members
of
the
little
human
flower
all
star
company
had
been
persuaded
to
remain
for
a
special
three
nights
engagement
in
order
to
produce
the
sparkling
comedy
lord
bob
new
york
latest
and
biggest
success
by
the
popular
playwright
sidney
cremer
at
least
a
dozen
duplicates
of
this
announcement
he
produced
after
hours
of
painstaking
labour
which
cost
him
a
cramp
in
his
right
hand
if
not
in
his
temper
it
really
was
nervous
work
for
an
amateur
drawing
out
and
spacing
the
huge
letters
with
pencil
then
filling
them
in
with
thick
splashes
of
black
paint
especially
as
the
paper
was
thin
sometimes
letting
the
big
brush
break
through
and
costing
another
sheet
another
hour
toil
but
it
was
extraordinary
how
much
interest
loveland
took
in
his
task
how
easily
controlled
was
his
impulse
to
be
cross
when
ed
binney
or
pa
winter
interrupted
him
with
a
suggestion
he
felt
that
the
company
present
plight
had
been
brought
about
partly
by
him
through
his
friendship
with
lillie
how
could
miss
moon
guess
it
was
for
bill
sake
and
his
thoughtless
promise
of
secrecy
therefore
he
was
inclined
to
do
his
best
to
atone
and
the
young
soldier
who
once
had
thought
all
work
and
most
pleasures
a
bore
toiled
like
a
slave
through
a
whole
day
and
half
a
night
to
save
ed
binney
fatigue
after
midnight
when
the
impromptu
posters
were
ready
loveland
and
pa
winter
went
out
together
with
big
rolls
of
paper
under
their
arms
and
a
huge
pot
of
flour
paste
stirred
up
for
the
sake
of
gordon
by
the
hand
of
the
landlord
niece
over
the
kitchen
fire
they
had
no
right
to
grab
spaces
pa
winter
pointed
out
and
if
they
put
up
the
new
paper
on
top
of
the
old
the
agent
of
the
dandy
lady
minstrels
would
ruthlessly
cause
it
to
be
covered
over
with
his
own
bills
still
despite
these
pessimistic
prophecies
loveland
distributed
the
advertisements
of
lord
bob
as
well
as
he
could
hoping
for
the
mercy
or
the
negligence
of
the
coming
rival
what
remained
of
the
night
he
spent
in
committing
to
memory
the
part
of
lord
bob
for
which
without
a
dissenting
voice
the
five
other
members
of
the
company
had
cast
him
it
was
a
part
which
a
london
or
new
york
leading
man
would
have
studied
for
two
weeks
rehearsed
for
three
and
finally
played
with
joy
mingled
with
misgiving
but
loveland
could
not
afford
artistic
scruples
the
play
was
the
thing
and
the
acting
must
take
care
of
itself
they
went
out
to
rehearsal
early
next
morning
and
were
thankful
that
there
had
been
neither
rain
nor
snow
to
destroy
the
fragile
posters
in
front
of
one
which
loveland
had
put
up
on
the
face
of
the
opera
house
stood
a
girl
and
an
old
man
talking
in
low
voices
they
reading
about
the
play
and
making
up
their
minds
to
come
muttered
loveland
to
lillie
de
lisle
with
whom
he
had
walked
to
the
theatre
as
he
spoke
the
pair
turned
and
stared
sharply
for
an
instant
at
the
actor
and
actress
loveland
was
disappointed
after
all
they
did
not
look
like
the
sort
of
persons
who
would
care
to
attend
a
performance
given
by
the
girl
was
a
lady
the
man
a
gentleman
they
were
well
dressed
their
faces
had
a
cultivated
expression
indescribable
yet
unmistakable
altogether
they
were
of
a
different
order
from
the
people
who
had
composed
the
audiences
at
the
opera
house
during
the
past
week
i
shall
certainly
write
and
tell
them
what
going
on
remarked
the
girl
to
her
companion
who
was
probably
her
father
it
a
shame
something
ought
to
be
done
we
might
telegraph
if
you
think
it
would
be
worth
while
replied
the
old
man
loveland
heard
the
words
spoken
as
the
pair
turned
away
to
walk
down
the
street
towards
the
residence
part
of
the
town
but
he
attached
no
importance
to
the
disjointed
sentences
the
affairs
of
the
human
flower
company
were
occupying
his
mind
for
the
moment
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
he
was
not
even
thinking
of
lost
lesley
dearmer
or
wondering
whether
there
would
be
a
letter
from
his
mother
forwarded
by
bill
to
bonnerstown
this
week
everybody
was
in
deadly
earnest
and
the
rehearsal
went
off
very
well
considering
all
its
disadvantages
they
had
another
in
the
afternoon
and
by
that
time
they
learned
joyfully
a
few
seats
had
actually
been
booked
in
advance
ed
binney
cough
had
not
improved
but
he
was
kept
up
on
strong
hot
coffee
and
they
got
through
the
performance
that
night
two
men
short
almost
without
a
hitch
nevertheless
though
lord
bob
was
a
great
new
york
success
as
sidney
cremer
comedies
always
were
and
bristled
with
brilliant
scenes
and
bright
dialogue
it
was
a
little
above
the
heads
of
an
average
ashville
audience
a
few
well
though
plainly
dressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
in
the
front
seats
and
all
seemed
to
know
each
other
laughing
and
talking
together
between
the
acts
and
among
them
through
a
peephole
in
the
curtain
loveland
recognised
the
girl
and
old
man
he
had
seen
staring
at
his
poster
in
the
morning
the
rest
of
the
audience
however
were
of
the
usual
sort
and
preferred
wild
melodrama
to
sparkling
light
comedy
the
profits
of
the
first
performance
and
the
next
were
not
what
val
had
expected
though
the
acting
of
the
company
improved
but
on
the
last
night
loveland
tried
to
hope
that
ashville
would
turn
out
in
full
force
having
set
the
first
scene
himself
in
default
of
a
stage
manager
or
competent
stage
hands
he
applied
an
anxious
eye
to
a
small
in
the
curtain
and
peeped
out
his
heart
sank
the
house
was
half
empty
but
it
was
early
still
there
was
hope
yet
people
were
coming
in
there
was
the
old
gentleman
and
the
girl
he
had
seen
before
finding
their
way
once
more
to
the
front
seats
someone
was
with
them
they
were
bringing
guests
that
looked
encouraging
val
lingered
at
the
the
girl
and
her
father
sat
down
with
them
were
lesley
dearmer
and
her
aunt
loveland
chapter
pirates
for
an
instant
val
thought
of
nothing
but
the
heavenly
surprise
of
seeing
the
girl
he
loved
recognition
brought
a
shock
of
joy
and
a
wave
of
love
which
had
been
held
in
check
for
a
time
by
the
weight
of
misfortune
as
the
waters
of
a
stormy
river
in
flood
are
held
back
by
the
shut
gates
of
a
lock
he
had
known
that
he
loved
her
too
well
for
peace
of
mind
more
passionately
and
purely
than
he
had
thought
it
was
in
him
to
love
but
until
he
saw
her
face
looking
up
as
if
at
him
yet
unconscious
of
his
gaze
the
dear
charming
face
he
had
longed
for
through
all
his
miseries
scarcely
dreaming
ever
to
see
her
again
he
had
not
realised
how
utterly
precious
it
was
how
entirely
indispensable
in
his
life
a
wild
impulse
rushed
over
him
to
call
her
name
lesley
lesley
and
spring
from
behind
the
curtain
as
if
they
two
were
alone
together
in
a
world
of
their
own
but
after
the
first
luminous
instant
the
joy
of
her
presence
was
blotted
out
in
darkness
he
remembered
everything
remembered
that
he
was
perceval
gordon
an
actor
of
the
submerged
tenth
a
wretched
penniless
who
for
the
moment
came
near
to
being
an
object
of
charity
when
he
had
bidden
lesley
goodbye
he
was
a
splendid
being
who
looked
down
from
his
heights
and
though
loving
her
saw
her
impossible
as
a
wife
their
friendship
had
begun
by
being
somewhat
of
a
condescension
on
his
part
from
his
own
point
of
view
at
least
and
she
half
amused
half
angry
had
seen
that
point
of
view
quite
clearly
nor
had
she
ever
attempted
to
change
it
to
the
last
at
the
thought
that
the
curtain
would
ring
up
and
show
him
as
he
was
now
to
the
astonished
eyes
of
lesley
dearmer
he
could
have
run
away
out
of
the
theatre
anywhere
it
mattered
not
where
if
only
she
need
not
see
him
need
not
know
that
the
magnificent
lord
loveland
and
the
miserable
gordon
were
one
his
blood
surged
up
to
his
head
throbbing
in
his
temples
and
tingling
in
his
ears
but
through
the
confusion
of
his
senses
penetrated
the
knowledge
that
he
could
not
go
this
trial
of
endurance
it
seemed
to
him
the
hardest
of
all
the
ordeals
he
had
been
forced
to
face
during
that
fortnight
which
was
a
decade
he
would
have
to
go
through
as
he
had
gone
through
the
others
because
to
evade
it
he
must
be
worse
than
a
coward
he
would
be
coward
and
traitor
as
well
and
under
all
his
faults
there
was
something
which
would
not
let
him
be
traitor
or
coward
selfish
he
had
been
but
the
shell
of
his
selfishness
had
been
broken
by
many
hard
knocks
and
the
real
self
once
so
comfortably
housed
within
was
finding
itself
though
all
still
with
the
cold
let
him
suffer
as
he
might
and
must
he
could
desert
these
people
whom
he
had
undertaken
to
help
out
of
the
trouble
in
which
by
his
inexperience
he
had
landed
them
he
was
responsible
for
putting
on
lord
bob
and
his
was
the
principal
part
crudely
as
he
knew
that
he
played
it
the
performance
could
not
go
on
without
him
if
he
refused
to
act
the
curtain
could
not
ring
up
and
the
money
in
the
theatre
would
have
to
be
refunded
to
the
disappointed
audience
there
were
not
many
dollars
there
at
all
events
not
many
would
remain
for
the
company
after
the
local
manager
had
taken
out
his
share
but
there
would
be
enough
with
what
had
come
in
on
the
two
previous
nights
to
pay
the
bill
at
the
hotel
loveland
felt
that
it
would
have
been
almost
easier
to
shoot
himself
than
to
give
the
signal
for
the
curtain
to
ring
up
yet
the
moment
came
when
he
could
delay
no
longer
he
was
not
actor
enough
to
forget
in
his
acting
the
world
beyond
the
stage
he
did
not
lose
his
lines
but
conscious
of
lesley
eyes
upon
him
he
felt
as
stiff
as
jerky
in
every
movement
as
a
mechanical
doll
it
was
worse
between
acts
than
when
he
was
on
the
stage
for
he
pictured
lesley
head
and
her
aunt
bent
near
to
one
another
while
he
and
his
affairs
were
discussed
in
whispers
perhaps
with
stifled
laughter
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
evening
would
never
end
but
at
last
the
curtain
went
down
on
the
third
act
and
loveland
was
making
a
bolt
for
his
dressing
room
when
one
of
the
stage
hands
intercepted
him
holding
out
an
envelope
say
you
the
manager
of
this
show
ai
you
asked
the
man
i
suppose
i
am
at
present
said
loveland
not
attempting
to
evade
responsibility
well
then
this
is
for
you
and
the
letter
was
in
his
hand
to
the
manager
of
the
company
producing
bob
was
the
address
pencilled
in
an
attractive
handwriting
which
might
be
that
of
a
man
or
a
woman
val
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
tore
open
the
envelope
on
a
sheet
of
the
ashville
theatre
paper
were
written
the
words
a
friend
and
agent
of
sidney
cremer
will
be
obliged
by
a
few
words
with
the
manager
of
the
company
in
the
private
room
of
the
manager
of
the
opera
house
kindly
lent
for
the
occasion
loveland
read
the
communication
and
handed
it
to
ed
binney
who
was
passing
ed
gave
a
long
low
whistle
which
set
him
coughing
again
and
said
whew
this
is
the
last
straw
is
it
why
asked
loveland
do
you
see
someone
put
the
author
on
to
us
you
know
pirates
regular
do
you
yes
replied
val
jacobus
initiated
me
into
the
mysteries
but
what
can
they
do
to
us
there
a
big
fine
for
the
offence
loveland
laughed
i
wish
cremer
joy
of
it
oh
that
all
very
well
but
if
he
cuts
up
rough
he
can
make
us
a
lot
of
trouble
i
afraid
though
i
do
know
much
about
such
things
i
only
know
we
were
always
running
the
risk
but
in
these
small
towns
there
ai
much
danger
as
the
shows
do
get
noticed
by
the
dramatic
papers
i
believe
jacobus
was
never
caught
but
we
copped
this
time
sure
enough
i
would
go
into
the
lion
den
if
i
was
you
let
the
lion
come
to
us
at
the
hotel
if
he
does
find
out
beforehand
that
we
would
make
a
meal
worth
eating
meanwhile
perhaps
he
have
the
police
the
luggage
or
something
argued
loveland
heaven
knows
i
have
got
much
but
the
rest
of
you
have
and
you
ca
afford
to
lose
it
no
i
go
and
face
the
music
perhaps
when
cremer
agent
understands
the
fix
we
in
he
let
us
down
easy
well
maybe
you
right
binney
agreed
but
it
seems
a
shame
you
should
have
to
stand
up
and
be
shot
at
alone
loveland
laughed
dubiously
i
riddled
with
bullets
already
i
wipe
the
paint
off
my
face
and
go
tell
the
fellow
to
aim
straight
and
have
done
with
it
i
see
you
through
if
i
was
such
a
crock
said
poor
ed
coughing
go
and
tell
the
others
what
up
val
advised
him
they
may
be
able
to
strike
camp
and
get
away
with
the
supply
wagons
while
i
engage
the
enemy
three
minutes
later
loveland
was
at
the
door
of
the
local
room
he
opened
it
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
lesley
dearmer
who
was
standing
there
alone
chapter
the
whole
truth
miss
dearmer
he
stammered
gordon
i
believe
she
said
primly
she
wore
a
simple
grey
dress
which
he
remembered
to
have
seen
and
liked
on
the
ship
how
sweet
how
dear
she
was
with
her
soft
bright
eyes
and
long
curled
eyelashes
involuntarily
he
put
out
his
hand
but
she
seemed
not
to
see
the
gesture
and
the
hand
dropped
i
used
the
name
i
thought
it
was
better
he
explained
trying
to
keep
his
head
yes
no
doubt
it
was
better
she
answered
and
it
really
my
name
he
went
on
one
of
my
names
you
have
so
many
my
sponsors
in
baptism
the
newspapers
accused
you
of
being
your
own
sponsor
the
newspapers
accused
me
what
do
you
mean
surely
you
know
i
told
you
i
should
read
about
you
but
i
expected
to
read
very
different
things
however
we
wo
talk
of
that
now
but
we
must
for
a
moment
he
was
the
old
masterful
loveland
we
must
i
want
to
know
what
you
mean
that
can
wait
awhile
i
came
to
ask
what
mean
though
i
did
read
the
newspapers
i
was
surprised
to
find
you
here
i
acting
for
my
friend
sidney
cremer
a
cousin
of
sidney
and
mine
who
lives
a
few
miles
out
of
ashville
saw
bob
advertised
for
performance
and
telegraphed
sidney
could
come
but
my
aunt
brought
me
tonight
as
sidney
cremer
interests
and
mine
are
rather
closely
allied
and
you
know
nobody
has
a
right
to
produce
the
play
without
the
permission
yes
i
know
answered
loveland
dejectedly
but
his
depression
arose
not
so
much
from
the
consciousness
of
wrongdoing
as
from
the
suspicion
engendered
by
the
girl
tone
in
speaking
of
sidney
cremer
interests
and
hers
were
closely
allied
she
had
blushed
and
even
faltered
a
little
as
she
made
the
statement
and
val
sprang
instantly
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
engaged
to
marry
cremer
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
when
they
played
at
platonic
friendship
on
board
the
that
lesley
dearmer
might
be
engaged
she
had
never
said
in
so
many
words
that
she
was
not
but
she
had
at
all
the
manner
of
a
girl
who
had
disposed
of
her
future
in
any
case
however
whether
the
affair
were
new
or
of
old
standing
loveland
felt
miserably
certain
that
she
was
engaged
now
and
he
stood
convicted
of
defrauding
the
man
whom
she
intended
to
marry
was
there
any
depth
of
wretchedness
or
of
humiliation
which
the
thirteenth
marquis
of
loveland
had
not
plumbed
at
last
you
admit
that
you
knew
and
yet
you
produced
and
played
in
the
piece
i
did
but
he
hesitated
should
he
attempt
to
excuse
himself
to
disclaim
responsibility
or
would
that
only
seem
cowardly
in
her
eyes
but
what
you
see
i
bound
to
report
to
my
friend
your
friend
broke
out
loveland
losing
his
head
you
are
going
to
marry
him
sidney
cremer
yes
you
do
deny
it
she
laughed
gently
why
should
i
deny
it
to
you
have
you
any
right
to
question
me
or
bring
me
to
book
about
anything
mr
gordon
i
know
i
have
no
right
he
admitted
forgive
me
he
guessed
that
her
emphasis
and
her
frequent
repetition
of
the
name
gordon
meant
that
she
wished
him
to
understand
the
change
in
their
relationship
to
her
he
was
now
only
gordon
the
actor
who
had
stolen
sidney
cremer
play
the
past
was
to
be
forgotten
i
must
remind
you
again
lesley
went
on
in
a
cool
businesslike
manner
though
her
eyes
were
starry
that
i
have
come
twenty
miles
to
question
you
and
my
aunt
is
waiting
for
you
with
the
cousins
who
telegraphed
about
bob
you
know
you
must
go
on
using
sidney
cremer
play
we
have
no
intention
of
doing
so
said
loveland
and
then
in
as
few
words
as
possible
without
any
attempt
at
defending
himself
for
his
part
in
the
transaction
he
explained
baldly
that
the
manager
had
deserted
the
company
and
that
they
had
only
one
piece
lord
bob
they
had
produced
it
for
three
nights
in
the
hope
of
making
money
enough
to
get
away
but
the
result
had
proved
disappointing
my
affairs
are
rather
in
a
muddle
just
now
loveland
finished
but
as
soon
as
i
get
them
straightened
out
again
which
i
expect
to
do
shortly
i
will
myself
pay
cremer
fee
for
these
performances
if
you
let
me
know
what
they
are
oh
sidney
would
want
you
to
do
that
the
girl
explained
i
neither
of
us
knew
that
the
company
was
in
trouble
my
cousins
here
did
tell
us
that
i
suppose
they
did
know
either
we
thought
it
was
simply
an
ordinary
case
of
piracy
but
i
can
answer
for
sidney
as
if
it
were
for
myself
he
would
want
fees
and
he
would
take
any
severe
measures
in
such
a
case
as
this
if
only
you
give
me
your
word
lord
lo
i
mean
gordon
that
these
people
wo
go
about
the
country
playing
this
piece
i
ask
nothing
more
you
may
set
cremer
mind
at
rest
about
that
loveland
answered
bitterly
they
are
likely
to
go
about
the
country
playing
any
piece
you
mean
they
you
are
stranded
here
enquired
lesley
oh
i
all
right
loveland
said
hurriedly
far
from
wishing
to
pose
as
an
object
of
pity
it
the
others
i
thinking
of
she
gave
him
a
quick
clear
look
would
you
go
away
and
leave
them
here
in
trouble
she
asked
no
i
wo
do
that
replied
val
i
mean
to
do
something
for
them
what
can
you
do
if
your
affairs
are
in
such
a
muddle
as
you
say
i
do
know
yet
i
trying
hard
to
think
wo
there
be
money
enough
from
these
three
performances
of
bob
to
pay
their
railway
fares
somewhere
i
afraid
not
hardly
enough
to
settle
with
the
landlord
and
get
him
to
release
their
luggage
which
he
keeping
till
last
week
board
bills
are
paid
your
luggage
too
loveland
grew
red
i
have
any
oh
the
colour
flew
to
her
cheeks
as
if
in
sympathy
with
the
flush
she
could
not
help
seeing
on
his
no
trunks
you
say
you
read
the
newspapers
said
loveland
if
you
did
you
perhaps
saw
that
the
hotel
people
in
new
york
treated
me
rather
curiously
i
did
read
the
stuff
myself
i
really
could
bring
myself
to
do
it
but
i
gathered
from
hints
given
me
here
and
there
that
the
journalists
had
a
pretty
rough
game
with
me
you
had
a
game
with
them
to
begin
with
said
lesley
i
shut
my
door
in
the
face
of
one
on
my
first
day
in
new
york
loveland
admitted
next
day
i
had
a
door
to
shut
america
been
very
hospitable
to
me
what
could
you
expect
asked
lesley
defending
her
countrymen
her
face
was
grave
but
there
was
an
odd
sparkle
in
her
eyes
americans
do
like
having
tricks
played
on
them
i
played
no
trick
you
played
a
part
the
part
of
lord
loveland
val
stared
how
can
a
man
play
that
he
himself
do
you
deny
the
newspaper
accusations
then
what
accusations
i
did
knock
a
man
down
in
the
street
and
he
gave
his
own
version
of
the
story
oh
i
do
mean
that
story
but
quite
another
the
story
he
said
you
knocked
him
down
for
alluding
to
when
we
talking
at
cross
purposes
broke
in
loveland
bewildered
for
the
sake
of
any
friendship
you
may
ever
have
had
for
me
though
i
not
asking
you
to
continue
it
in
future
explain
what
you
mean
but
do
mean
that
you
read
nothing
heard
nothing
of
what
they
were
saying
about
you
in
new
york
i
told
you
i
would
look
at
the
papers
what
i
heard
i
of
course
took
for
granted
was
in
connection
with
the
hotel
affair
and
the
row
in
the
street
lesley
thought
for
a
minute
with
an
expression
on
her
face
which
loveland
could
not
understand
though
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
fallen
lashes
the
beautiful
lashes
which
had
fascinated
him
at
first
sight
of
her
on
the
presently
an
idea
seemed
to
commend
itself
to
the
girl
on
her
arm
a
little
gold
and
platinum
bag
hung
from
its
chain
loveland
had
often
seen
this
bag
on
shipboard
and
had
even
frequently
picked
it
up
from
the
floor
where
the
girl
dropped
it
half
a
dozen
times
each
day
when
she
slipped
out
from
under
the
rugs
of
her
deck
chair
well
did
he
know
the
two
compartments
in
this
favourite
little
receptacle
of
treasures
he
knew
in
which
one
she
kept
the
handkerchief
which
smelt
like
fresh
violets
in
which
her
money
her
cardcase
her
stylographic
pen
and
a
letter
or
two
and
now
he
watched
her
with
eyes
homesick
for
past
days
as
she
took
out
the
remembered
cardcase
and
from
an
inner
pocket
of
that
cardcase
a
folded
newspaper
cutting
it
quite
time
you
did
read
for
yourself
she
said
this
will
make
you
understand
better
than
i
can
tell
you
fanny
milton
cut
it
out
of
york
light
and
posted
it
to
me
i
kept
it
here
i
hardly
know
why
but
now
i
glad
i
did
it
was
tony
kidd
first
article
that
loveland
read
with
a
shock
of
surprise
which
at
the
very
beginning
set
the
blood
humming
in
his
ears
like
the
sound
of
the
sea
in
a
shell
tony
had
told
his
story
spicily
in
a
way
to
make
his
readers
laugh
but
loveland
did
not
laugh
he
read
on
and
on
dazed
at
first
then
with
a
burst
of
enlightenment
which
made
clear
many
mysteries
the
difficult
young
man
to
approach
had
come
to
new
york
to
see
heiresses
and
conquer
papas
said
tony
he
had
begun
the
conquering
process
on
board
ship
being
a
youth
of
a
thrifty
turn
of
mind
who
believed
in
taking
time
by
the
forelock
he
had
made
friends
he
had
even
perhaps
made
love
soon
no
doubt
he
would
have
made
a
match
but
the
schemes
of
mice
men
and
even
marquises
have
a
way
of
going
wrong
especially
when
and
that
when
reminded
tony
to
pause
and
ask
a
conundrum
when
is
a
marquis
not
a
marquis
the
writer
invited
the
public
to
guess
why
when
he
a
valet
of
course
and
then
tony
went
on
to
protest
gaily
that
neither
he
nor
his
paper
was
responsible
for
the
assertion
that
this
marquis
was
not
a
marquis
they
merely
put
the
question
and
gave
the
answer
for
what
it
was
worth
on
the
strength
of
certain
sensational
news
just
received
from
the
land
where
marquises
grew
on
blackberry
bushes
for
heiresses
to
cull
a
number
of
people
prominent
in
new
york
society
had
received
cablegrams
from
london
informing
them
that
the
valet
of
the
marquis
of
loveland
had
absconded
with
his
lordship
jewellery
and
other
belongings
that
the
fugitive
was
known
to
have
impersonated
his
master
in
london
obtaining
goods
from
tradesmen
and
running
up
bills
at
hotels
in
lord
loveland
name
if
a
person
calling
himself
the
marquis
of
loveland
should
appear
in
new
york
presenting
letters
of
introduction
to
the
said
prominent
people
earlier
than
the
arrival
of
the
white
star
liner
they
were
to
beware
of
him
as
the
real
lord
loveland
expected
to
sail
on
that
ship
on
the
very
day
when
these
cablegrams
were
received
tony
kidd
went
on
to
state
there
arrived
by
a
strange
coincidence
an
attractive
looking
and
haughty
young
gentleman
known
among
acquaintances
collected
on
the
as
lord
loveland
this
alleged
nobleman
had
gone
to
the
where
through
a
servant
of
the
hotel
it
was
soon
discovered
that
his
pretentious
trunks
were
practically
empty
he
had
perhaps
naturally
refused
to
be
interviewed
by
a
representative
of
light
and
the
manner
of
his
refusal
was
somewhat
graphically
described
act
was
a
round
of
calls
with
letters
of
introduction
to
all
the
prominent
people
warned
by
a
friend
also
prominent
in
england
act
a
scene
in
the
waldorf
restaurant
where
some
shipboard
acquaintances
dining
with
one
of
the
prominent
people
had
heard
from
him
of
the
cablegram
and
of
course
refused
to
acknowledge
acquaintance
with
the
attractive
nobleman
when
he
appeared
in
the
room
ready
to
greet
the
whole
party
with
effusion
act
the
hotel
authorities
being
informed
request
lord
loveland
to
find
other
accommodation
act
the
husband
and
father
of
the
two
ladies
whom
lord
loveland
met
on
the
attacked
and
knocked
down
in
the
street
by
the
difficult
young
man
to
approach
now
at
last
loveland
understood
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
in
new
york
even
to
the
mystery
of
the
bank
again
he
seemed
to
see
cadwallader
hunter
bending
to
talk
with
the
dark
young
man
who
had
dined
with
the
coolidges
van
cotter
had
doubtless
been
one
of
those
who
had
received
the
warning
cablegrams
and
naturally
he
had
passed
on
the
interesting
news
to
the
coolidges
and
miltons
cadwallader
hunter
who
had
stopped
to
chat
with
the
party
had
been
just
in
time
to
glean
the
information
and
had
taken
revenge
for
the
rudeness
of
the
morning
by
advising
the
hotel
people
to
get
rid
of
an
undesirable
client
oh
yes
it
was
easy
enough
to
see
it
all
now
even
the
reason
why
his
mother
and
the
london
bankers
had
failed
to
answer
his
appeals
for
money
they
had
thought
that
foxham
was
cabling
and
had
accordingly
refused
to
be
taken
in
apparently
foxham
had
absconded
somewhere
and
his
misdoings
had
been
discovered
on
the
other
side
before
his
late
master
had
found
him
out
perhaps
foxham
had
taken
the
ticket
for
the
which
he
val
had
instructed
him
to
sell
and
used
it
for
himself
booking
as
a
passenger
for
america
in
the
name
of
lord
loveland
in
that
case
the
fellow
had
doubtless
arrived
in
new
york
by
this
time
on
the
the
ship
on
which
his
master
had
originally
intended
to
sail
and
heaven
alone
knew
what
new
mischief
he
might
have
been
working
on
this
side
of
the
water
the
thought
of
what
might
have
happened
was
almost
as
infuriating
as
the
knowledge
of
what
certainly
had
happened
it
all
came
from
accepting
the
chance
offered
by
jim
harborough
to
sail
on
the
but
in
spite
of
everything
he
had
suffered
loveland
told
himself
that
he
would
not
have
it
different
if
he
had
come
over
on
the
he
would
probably
by
this
time
be
engaged
to
some
american
heiress
and
would
never
have
met
lesley
dearmer
just
now
his
acquaintance
with
her
combined
with
all
the
other
extraordinary
results
of
his
sailing
on
the
was
putting
him
to
the
torture
and
he
was
gloomily
convinced
that
nothing
would
ever
make
things
come
right
nevertheless
he
was
dimly
subconsciously
aware
even
in
this
bitter
moment
that
he
would
choose
release
from
torture
at
the
price
of
not
knowing
the
girl
all
this
is
a
surprise
to
you
then
her
voice
broke
into
the
midst
of
his
reflections
over
the
newspaper
cutting
completely
how
very
odd
that
you
did
read
the
papers
exclaimed
lesley
i
was
so
disgusted
with
the
way
new
york
was
treating
me
that
i
very
keen
to
see
what
it
was
saying
of
me
besides
as
i
told
you
i
thought
i
know
i
supposed
it
was
all
about
the
hotel
fuss
and
my
knocking
down
that
man
milton
why
you
knock
him
down
i
slapped
him
in
the
face
and
he
fell
down
but
why
did
you
slap
him
in
the
face
i
ca
tell
you
that
miss
dearmer
well
said
lesley
looking
at
him
always
from
under
her
lashes
to
see
how
he
was
taking
her
words
you
been
dreadfully
punished
at
all
events
i
do
think
i
deserved
punishment
for
that
do
you
of
course
i
do
know
anything
about
but
you
used
to
be
well
rather
arrogant
i
not
arrogant
now
loveland
smiled
faintly
i
almost
inclined
to
think
i
never
shall
be
again
if
you
not
really
lord
loveland
not
really
he
almost
gasped
as
he
would
have
repeated
her
words
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
even
while
he
read
the
cutting
that
lesley
dearmer
could
possibly
think
him
a
fraud
what
you
you
do
believe
in
me
he
stammered
apparently
she
was
untouched
by
the
reproach
the
actual
consternation
in
his
voice
why
should
believe
more
than
anyone
else
she
asked
with
a
little
dainty
sidewise
turn
of
her
head
i
was
only
a
ship
acquaintance
you
know
like
the
others
like
the
others
who
threw
me
over
he
said
yes
like
the
others
there
was
no
difference
was
there
she
challenged
him
but
loveland
was
in
no
mood
to
take
up
the
gauntlet
if
it
were
a
gauntlet
that
she
threw
down
i
suppose
not
he
answered
from
the
depths
you
valued
almost
all
your
other
acquaintances
on
board
more
than
you
did
me
the
girl
went
on
you
were
quite
frank
about
that
by
your
own
admission
you
were
a
bit
of
an
adventurer
coming
over
to
my
country
to
see
what
you
could
devour
i
used
to
hate
that
in
you
all
the
more
because
i
thought
you
a
adventurer
there
was
less
excuse
for
a
well
brought
up
man
with
every
advantage
of
birth
and
education
than
for
say
it
miss
dearmer
say
what
you
really
think
of
me
i
do
say
i
do
think
it
i
say
only
why
should
believe
in
you
when
other
people
do
i
see
now
there
reason
and
i
not
going
to
ask
you
to
believe
you
not
going
to
assure
me
that
you
are
the
real
lord
loveland
no
i
not
i
not
going
to
assert
myself
or
defend
myself
in
any
way
to
you
i
want
you
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
very
well
said
lesley
with
sparkling
eyes
i
do
draw
them
may
i
ask
what
they
are
you
may
ask
but
i
not
going
to
answer
your
question
just
now
there
are
other
questions
to
attend
to
which
we
dropped
for
this
subject
about
bob
for
instance
i
no
excuse
to
offer
even
for
stealing
your
friend
play
except
that
we
were
hard
up
and
we
saw
nothing
else
to
do
your
people
in
england
if
i
had
no
answer
to
my
cablegrams
there
no
time
for
answers
to
have
come
to
letters
yet
i
see
meanwhile
meanwhile
we
on
our
beam
ends
you
say
you
identify
yourself
with
these
people
these
poor
little
stranded
actors
oh
yes
i
one
of
them
a
poor
little
stranded
actor
too
you
not
going
to
desert
them
no
we
sink
or
swim
together
you
see
i
got
rather
fond
of
two
of
the
little
stranded
actors
my
companions
in
misery
ed
binney
who
very
ill
really
and
ought
to
be
acting
a
good
fellow
if
ever
there
was
one
and
miss
de
lisle
the
star
lesley
face
changed
slightly
and
her
lips
opened
but
she
did
not
speak
who
will
perhaps
some
day
marry
a
great
friend
of
mine
in
new
york
oh
so
you
have
a
friend
in
new
york
yes
one
he
paints
menus
in
the
twelfth
street
restaurant
where
i
was
a
waiter
how
you
have
changed
exclaimed
lesley
but
perhaps
it
only
circumstances
perhaps
said
loveland
if
i
knew
a
way
in
which
you
could
help
your
actor
friends
to
escape
from
here
and
go
wherever
they
want
to
go
would
you
take
it
i
wonder
asked
the
girl
i
do
wonder
i
sure
loveland
answered
thinking
of
poor
little
lillie
bill
gal
and
ed
binney
it
a
way
that
would
be
very
dig
lesley
hesitated
loveland
laughed
what
is
dig
i
forgotten
oh
if
you
have
i
tell
you
the
way
at
once
and
perhaps
that
will
bring
it
back
to
your
memory
would
you
care
to
take
a
position
in
somebody
house
as
as
well
a
paid
position
with
an
advance
on
your
salary
by
which
you
could
send
all
your
friends
happily
away
i
do
it
like
a
shot
if
anyone
would
have
me
loveland
said
quickly
someone
have
you
shall
we
say
as
secretary
do
you
know
typewriting
or
shorthand
loveland
reluctantly
answered
that
he
did
not
dear
me
the
secretaryship
wo
answer
then
i
afraid
are
you
anything
of
a
linguist
ca
speak
a
word
of
any
language
but
my
own
except
a
hotch
potch
of
french
the
little
latin
i
ever
had
is
practically
gone
what
a
pity
are
you
good
at
mathematics
i
generally
add
up
on
my
fingers
never
could
remember
the
multiplication
table
history
then
could
you
help
a
friend
of
mine
who
writing
a
novel
on
the
fifteenth
century
all
i
know
about
the
fifteenth
century
that
i
can
think
of
at
this
moment
is
that
it
was
the
fourteenth
or
the
sixteenth
oh
afraid
i
no
good
after
all
miss
dearmer
you
have
to
give
me
up
as
a
bad
job
and
chuck
me
into
gaol
for
the
theft
of
cremer
play
i
never
had
any
proper
education
have
you
i
not
so
sure
about
that
said
lesley
with
an
inflection
in
her
voice
that
val
could
quite
understand
and
i
not
sure
you
have
learnt
your
lesson
rather
well
which
one
enquired
loveland
ruefully
but
she
could
not
have
understood
the
question
for
she
went
on
talking
as
if
it
had
not
been
asked
you
must
be
able
to
do
she
said
her
dimples
well
in
control
you
seen
that
i
ca
act
but
well
i
can
shoot
pretty
straight
ah
i
do
know
anyone
who
keeps
a
shooting
gallery
and
ride
decently
nor
anyone
who
wants
a
riding
master
oh
but
now
can
you
drive
a
yes
said
loveland
good
do
you
understand
the
mechanism
of
cars
of
two
or
three
as
well
as
or
better
than
most
chauffeurs
i
think
if
that
is
being
conceited
again
i
not
finding
fault
with
you
tonight
for
conceit
would
you
take
quite
a
temporary
job
as
chauffeur
in
in
a
private
family
with
a
sal
oh
i
might
as
well
say
wages
of
a
week
and
your
board
and
lodging
besides
if
i
could
get
the
first
week
in
advance
i
might
send
everybody
to
chicago
with
what
we
got
out
of
the
stolen
play
loveland
said
never
mind
the
stolen
play
in
sidney
cremer
name
i
forgive
you
all
now
i
know
the
circumstances
no
more
to
be
said
about
that
you
must
know
him
very
well
indeed
to
speak
for
him
so
positively
broke
in
loveland
gloomily
i
do
said
lesley
you
can
have
the
first
week
wages
in
advance
and
the
second
too
the
car
a
gloria
my
last
was
a
gloria
you
mean
lord
loveland
oh
yes
i
mean
lord
loveland
some
men
do
make
chauffeurs
of
their
valets
and
vice
versa
and
you
know
the
real
loveland
was
hard
up
or
thought
he
was
i
begin
to
see
now
that
he
did
know
what
being
hard
up
meant
even
english
peers
can
live
and
learn
while
they
young
i
suppose
said
lesley
meditatively
but
we
were
talking
about
you
were
we
do
you
accept
the
situation
i
offer
you
offer
well
for
my
friend
sidney
cremer
sidney
has
just
bought
a
new
car
and
sent
it
to
us
i
allowed
to
use
it
for
awhile
as
much
as
i
like
he
coming
then
we
expect
sidney
to
be
with
us
for
some
time
with
my
aunt
and
me
i
hanged
if
i
be
his
servant
val
exclaimed
with
something
of
his
old
vehemence
oh
very
well
gordon
i
thought
you
were
really
in
earnest
or
i
would
have
made
the
suggestion
so
i
am
but
there
often
a
in
such
cases
is
there
i
admit
it
be
a
particularly
agreeable
position
for
a
man
who
has
er
posed
as
a
peer
loveland
finished
for
her
bitterly
you
put
the
words
into
my
mouth
i
was
going
to
say
you
seemed
so
anxious
to
do
something
to
help
the
others
and
this
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
by
which
you
could
make
money
quickly
and
ed
binney
pale
face
and
lillie
wistful
eyes
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
before
the
unhappy
loveland
very
well
he
said
i
will
be
cremer
chauffeur
i
taken
his
play
i
take
his
money
i
take
his
food
i
live
under
his
roof
and
i
serve
him
as
well
as
i
can
and
i
only
ask
you
to
believe
one
decent
thing
of
me
miss
dearmer
that
it
is
for
my
own
sake
it
will
be
my
food
you
eat
said
lesley
sweetly
and
my
roof
which
will
give
you
shelter
loveland
drew
in
his
breath
hard
as
they
looked
at
each
other
yes
it
would
be
her
roof
and
her
food
that
was
the
worse
for
him
because
it
made
it
more
and
more
plain
that
sidney
cremer
must
be
very
near
and
dear
to
her
it
quite
settled
then
she
asked
pleasantly
it
quite
settled
he
echoed
for
a
fortnight
there
were
no
dimples
at
play
in
lesley
cheeks
but
one
might
almost
have
said
that
her
eyes
laughed
chapter
a
protégé
of
miss
lesley
dearmer
and
her
aunt
were
staying
that
night
at
ashville
with
their
friends
and
next
morning
everything
was
arranged
loveland
explained
that
in
a
fortnight
at
latest
he
would
certainly
be
released
from
the
bondage
of
his
embarrassments
therefore
he
would
take
service
as
cremer
chauffeur
only
for
that
length
of
time
thus
giving
his
employers
a
chance
to
find
a
good
man
for
a
permanent
engagement
he
received
from
lesley
the
two
weeks
wages
in
advance
and
the
fifty
dollars
a
far
larger
amount
than
he
had
touched
since
landing
seemed
to
him
a
respectable
sum
ten
dollars
he
kept
for
his
own
necessities
and
the
rest
he
divided
among
the
members
of
the
broken
company
the
profits
from
the
three
performances
of
lord
bob
paid
the
hotel
bills
for
all
and
left
a
few
dollars
over
lumped
together
there
was
enough
to
take
lillie
de
lisle
ed
binney
miss
clare
and
the
winters
to
chicago
leaving
something
to
tide
each
one
through
a
week
or
two
of
idleness
lillie
ed
and
miss
clare
could
hardly
express
their
gratitude
to
loveland
and
the
words
they
said
to
him
warmed
his
heart
as
it
had
never
been
warmed
before
there
was
a
queer
kind
of
happiness
in
sacrificing
himself
for
others
that
came
as
an
absolutely
new
sensation
to
val
he
wondered
at
it
feeling
the
glow
of
it
and
was
dimly
conscious
that
the
hardships
he
endured
had
unexpected
compensations
as
for
pa
and
ma
winter
they
were
less
openly
grateful
seeming
to
take
what
was
done
for
them
more
or
less
as
a
right
and
they
would
assuredly
have
protested
vigorously
had
loveland
favoured
his
friends
miss
de
lisle
and
ed
binney
beyond
what
they
the
winters
had
received
their
attitude
however
mattered
little
to
val
they
were
old
and
unfortunate
and
he
was
sorry
for
them
as
he
was
learning
to
be
sorry
for
those
upon
whom
the
world
was
hard
besides
lillie
and
ed
and
perhaps
miss
clare
would
have
refused
to
accept
anything
beyond
what
the
winters
shared
and
both
assured
val
that
one
day
before
long
they
would
repay
him
all
lillie
was
in
touch
with
bill
again
therefore
in
spite
of
the
uncertain
future
she
was
not
unhappy
she
had
written
to
bill
the
day
after
loveland
joined
the
company
had
sent
him
a
photograph
of
herself
and
a
collar
for
shakespeare
the
best
that
could
be
bought
for
fifty
cents
in
modunk
bill
had
answered
to
ashville
and
though
neither
had
any
prospects
both
had
unlimited
hope
now
that
they
were
sure
of
the
love
and
loyalty
which
had
outlived
discouragements
absence
and
unprosperous
years
lillie
was
going
to
chicago
and
chicago
might
have
something
to
offer
bye
and
bye
who
could
tell
she
and
bill
the
best
man
she
ever
knew
might
come
together
meanwhile
they
could
go
on
loving
each
other
the
girl
went
off
buoyed
up
with
hope
and
ed
binney
had
friends
in
chicago
he
would
rest
a
little
and
be
all
right
he
said
to
val
shaking
hands
over
and
over
again
in
the
moment
of
goodbye
to
reach
lesley
dearmer
home
it
was
necessary
to
travel
for
an
hour
in
a
slow
local
train
which
lingered
lovingly
at
each
tiny
station
by
the
way
and
then
to
drive
for
six
miles
in
a
carriage
this
last
stage
of
the
journey
ended
at
the
hill
farm
as
loveland
place
was
called
and
the
hill
farm
lay
in
charming
country
not
far
from
louisville
loveland
was
instructed
to
meet
the
two
ladies
at
the
train
and
receive
his
railway
ticket
having
seen
his
friends
off
for
chicago
and
at
noon
of
the
day
after
her
surprise
visit
to
the
theatre
miss
dearmer
newly
appointed
chauffeur
was
waiting
for
his
employer
at
the
ashville
station
in
his
hand
was
the
battered
bag
which
had
called
forth
the
contempt
of
jack
jacobus
and
in
his
heart
were
shame
rebellion
jealousy
and
joy
mingled
with
several
other
emotions
none
of
which
he
could
have
defined
least
of
all
the
joy
he
reminded
himself
that
there
could
now
be
no
possible
satisfaction
in
his
nearness
to
lesley
she
did
not
like
him
enough
to
believe
in
him
she
had
practically
admitted
that
she
accepted
the
estimate
of
strangers
and
the
circumstantial
evidence
which
made
him
seem
a
fraud
she
had
not
denied
her
engagement
to
sidney
cremer
whose
servant
loveland
had
pledged
himself
to
be
and
she
even
showed
or
val
imagined
it
a
mischievous
pleasure
in
the
situation
she
had
not
had
the
grace
to
say
i
know
this
is
all
horrid
and
humiliating
to
you
i
sorry
and
will
try
to
help
you
make
the
best
of
it
why
should
she
say
so
indeed
when
she
believed
him
to
be
no
better
than
an
adventurer
punished
for
a
mean
attempt
at
deceiving
regarded
from
that
point
of
view
he
ought
to
be
grateful
to
miss
dearmer
for
trusting
him
far
enough
to
take
him
on
as
a
chauffeur
but
he
was
not
grateful
he
thought
that
on
the
contrary
he
was
very
angry
yet
he
was
not
quite
sure
and
if
he
were
angry
it
was
a
strange
kind
of
anger
that
he
felt
he
had
to
wait
for
some
time
on
the
platform
before
miss
dearmer
appeared
and
then
she
came
towards
him
alone
auntie
is
saying
goodbye
to
our
ashville
friends
she
explained
i
they
not
going
to
stop
with
us
till
the
train
goes
i
thought
for
several
reasons
it
would
be
better
not
and
they
quite
understand
before
you
meet
my
aunt
i
want
a
little
talk
with
you
i
have
told
her
or
the
others
that
you
that
there
any
connection
between
you
and
the
newspaper
story
about
the
marquis
and
his
adventures
thank
you
that
was
considerate
said
val
somewhat
sarcastically
what
have
you
told
loveland
then
that
what
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
i
said
i
met
you
before
and
was
sorry
to
find
now
that
you
had
misfortunes
losing
your
money
and
other
things
that
had
put
you
into
an
uncomfortable
position
auntie
was
in
her
stateroom
on
board
ship
till
the
last
morning
and
then
i
did
point
you
out
to
her
if
she
saw
you
at
all
she
did
notice
you
particularly
and
besides
she
very
near
sighted
if
there
been
any
danger
of
her
recognising
you
she
would
have
done
so
at
the
theatre
last
night
when
you
were
playing
bob
she
knows
only
that
you
gordon
and
that
to
help
you
a
little
i
asked
you
to
act
as
chauffeur
for
a
short
time
till
you
can
get
something
better
and
till
cremer
can
get
someone
better
loveland
capped
her
words
you
have
to
be
tried
first
smiled
the
girl
before
we
can
tell
whether
you
good
better
or
best
meanwhile
aunt
barbara
just
trusting
me
she
always
does
for
she
used
to
what
she
calls
my
funny
ways
and
she
found
out
that
there
some
sense
in
them
my
experiments
generally
turn
out
successes
then
i
to
consider
myself
one
of
your
experiments
decidedly
laughed
lesley
and
i
mean
you
to
be
a
success
a
great
success
now
i
going
to
auntie
i
think
we
better
travel
in
different
cars
for
she
has
quite
got
used
yet
to
the
idea
of
a
gentleman
chauffeur
i
told
her
that
they
the
fashion
and
prepared
to
take
you
on
faith
but
the
first
time
she
travels
in
your
company
you
had
better
be
in
the
motor
with
that
the
girl
pressed
a
railway
ticket
into
his
hand
and
he
was
left
not
knowing
whether
he
were
more
inclined
to
laughter
or
to
cursing
but
the
train
came
at
this
moment
and
he
had
no
time
to
analyse
his
mood
at
louisville
a
carriage
was
waiting
for
loveland
and
miss
dearmer
it
was
a
brougham
and
there
was
room
in
it
only
for
themselves
and
their
handbags
the
chauffeur
was
told
off
to
a
hired
vehicle
for
which
his
employers
would
pay
once
outside
the
suburbs
of
the
big
town
the
country
was
pretty
and
reminded
val
so
strongly
of
england
that
it
brought
on
an
attack
of
homesickness
the
hill
farm
might
almost
have
been
an
english
farm
with
its
rambling
house
apparently
of
the
georgian
period
its
windows
and
its
pillared
porch
draped
with
a
tangle
of
grapevine
and
virginia
creeper
val
had
seen
at
home
converted
by
the
younger
sons
of
gentlemen
into
pleasant
if
modest
mansions
and
the
gracious
elms
the
sturdy
old
oaks
and
generous
apple
trees
might
all
have
been
transplanted
from
an
english
landscape
val
arrived
only
a
few
minutes
later
than
lesley
and
loveland
and
the
girl
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
open
when
his
hack
drove
up
this
is
a
big
old
house
said
lesley
coming
out
into
the
porch
at
least
it
old
for
america
it
stood
for
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
there
lots
of
room
in
it
you
will
live
in
the
west
wing
in
a
few
minutes
uncle
wally
will
show
you
where
to
go
already
given
directions
to
have
your
quarters
got
ready
but
while
the
servants
are
busy
there
you
may
as
well
come
out
with
me
and
have
a
look
at
at
sidney
new
car
i
hope
you
like
it
here
uncle
wally
take
gordon
bag
this
order
was
a
surprise
to
loveland
he
had
supposed
that
the
uncle
wally
who
was
presently
to
be
his
guide
would
turn
out
to
be
a
relative
of
miss
dearmer
perhaps
the
master
of
the
house
but
it
was
a
very
ancient
and
very
black
darkey
dressed
in
a
sombre
livery
who
came
forward
all
white
grin
and
low
bows
the
knuckly
black
hand
relieved
loveland
of
the
shabby
bag
but
there
was
no
contempt
either
for
the
bag
or
its
owner
on
the
mild
old
face
of
the
negro
who
was
as
perfect
and
well
trained
a
servant
in
his
way
as
any
butler
in
an
english
country
house
evidently
he
too
had
been
told
that
this
was
a
gentleman
chauffeur
to
be
treated
like
a
gentleman
and
loveland
was
grateful
to
his
hostess
feeling
a
sudden
impulse
towards
happiness
until
with
a
shock
he
remembered
sidney
cremer
when
will
cremer
arrive
he
asked
lesley
as
they
walked
together
across
a
sloping
lawn
towards
the
stables
oh
sidney
very
much
at
home
here
she
answered
lightly
you
may
see
him
at
any
time
meanwhile
you
wo
mind
driving
the
car
for
me
will
you
i
think
you
know
whether
i
mind
that
or
not
said
loveland
almost
more
to
himself
than
to
the
girl
if
only
there
were
no
sidney
cremer
i
have
an
idea
you
wo
dislike
sidney
when
you
meet
him
lesley
said
kindly
a
man
chauffeur
has
no
right
to
an
opinion
about
him
at
least
that
what
i
used
to
think
myself
said
val
and
now
and
now
are
your
ideas
changing
do
you
begin
to
feel
just
a
tiny
bit
that
but
the
guinea
stamp
and
man
a
man
for
that
for
if
you
do
after
all
it
wo
have
done
you
any
harm
to
come
to
america
said
lesley
it
riches
here
not
rank
which
counts
apparently
loveland
retorted
and
that
just
as
bad
riches
do
count
with
me
said
lesley
cremer
must
be
very
rich
grumbled
loveland
apparently
apropos
of
nothing
sidney
makes
a
good
deal
of
money
out
of
novels
and
plays
at
least
it
seems
a
good
deal
to
me
but
maybe
it
would
to
you
perhaps
earnings
amount
to
about
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
of
your
english
pounds
a
year
and
he
saved
quite
a
lot
too
for
he
been
popular
as
a
playwright
and
novelist
in
america
and
england
for
several
years
now
by
jove
exclaimed
loveland
what
a
lucky
beggar
that
just
expresses
it
a
beggar
for
he
was
almost
a
beggar
at
the
time
he
made
his
first
success
he
was
dependent
on
his
relations
when
a
child
for
his
father
and
mother
died
when
he
was
a
baby
leaving
him
not
a
penny
and
he
was
brought
up
with
the
idea
of
being
a
school
teacher
which
he
would
have
hated
success
like
that
often
spoils
people
said
val
frankly
ungracious
in
his
jealousy
i
do
think
it
spoiled
sidney
replied
the
girl
he
has
heaps
of
faults
but
i
should
call
him
conceited
or
vain
shall
you
be
married
soon
lesley
smiled
and
her
dimples
twinkled
it
is
decided
yet
but
i
daresay
it
will
be
soon
now
i
suppose
with
the
grand
ideas
you
used
to
talk
to
me
about
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
a
few
loose
thousands
lying
around
would
seem
like
shabby
genteel
poverty
to
you
do
hit
a
man
when
he
down
said
loveland
if
i
had
only
half
as
much
as
cremer
i
could
do
the
things
i
want
most
to
do
what
are
they
asked
lesley
for
it
was
still
some
distance
to
the
stable
which
was
also
for
the
present
garage
as
well
and
she
walked
slowly
on
the
moist
grass
picking
her
way
step
by
step
with
leisurely
daintiness
nowadays
the
things
i
feel
i
should
like
most
to
do
are
to
restore
our
poor
old
home
and
get
rid
of
my
debts
you
say
have
you
changed
your
mind
lately
i
changed
almost
everything
except
these
everlasting
tweeds
i
know
of
course
that
my
affairs
will
come
right
in
way
presently
i
shall
get
back
to
england
before
my
leave
up
but
i
sha
go
back
the
same
man
the
things
that
pleased
me
most
before
wo
be
the
things
to
please
me
most
in
future
i
feel
that
somehow
things
will
come
right
only
in
way
for
you
she
echoed
only
in
one
way
i
lost
the
chance
of
all
that
the
best
worth
having
if
i
ever
could
have
had
such
a
chance
you
too
young
to
give
up
hope
almost
as
young
as
sidney
cremer
what
he
younger
than
i
am
sidney
is
and
has
been
a
successful
novelist
and
playwright
for
three
years
a
sort
of
infant
phenomenon
think
of
pitt
lesley
reminded
him
smiling
once
you
said
you
did
like
men
under
they
seemed
so
raw
i
ought
to
be
flattered
that
you
should
remember
my
sayings
of
you
see
though
sidney
quite
different
from
other
men
especially
to
me
but
here
we
are
at
the
stables
we
talk
about
sidney
car
instead
of
sidney
just
one
question
first
exclaimed
loveland
stopping
short
in
front
of
the
but
neatly
kept
stables
and
spacious
southern
barn
i
know
i
have
any
right
to
ask
it
but
were
you
engaged
to
cremer
when
we
crossed
together
on
the
my
relations
with
sidney
were
then
exactly
what
they
are
now
replied
the
girl
with
a
pretty
primness
that
made
her
mouth
look
as
if
she
had
just
said
prunes
prisms
propriety
his
last
hope
gone
since
lesley
had
not
accepted
cremer
out
of
pique
loveland
was
silenced
a
darkey
groom
who
came
forward
grinning
opened
the
doors
of
an
inverted
and
showed
a
fine
black
and
scarlet
glittering
with
varnish
brass
and
newness
deeply
interested
or
feigning
interest
lesley
made
loveland
lift
the
shining
bonnet
and
explain
detail
after
detail
of
the
mechanism
it
sounds
fascinating
she
said
at
last
the
monster
only
arrived
three
days
ago
though
it
or
ought
i
to
say
was
on
order
months
and
months
ago
two
or
three
chauffeurs
have
come
in
from
louisville
to
be
interviewed
you
see
sidney
trusts
my
judgment
just
as
auntie
does
but
i
was
satisfied
with
them
perhaps
you
wo
be
satisfied
with
me
suggested
val
oh
you
only
a
temporary
chauffeur
she
answered
and
though
it
was
rather
cruel
to
remind
the
lonely
young
man
in
a
strange
land
how
soon
he
was
to
lose
his
only
friend
the
girl
smiled
as
she
spoke
i
must
just
put
up
with
you
as
you
are
you
quite
impressed
me
with
what
you
know
about
the
machine
part
i
daresay
you
can
drive
your
manner
and
appearance
are
nice
and
besides
besides
what
val
almost
snapped
at
her
it
seems
as
if
it
was
to
be
as
uncle
wally
says
when
he
breaks
a
dish
and
i
wondering
whether
i
shall
be
brave
enough
to
let
you
teach
me
to
drive
sidney
will
want
me
to
know
how
i
sure
loveland
suddenly
felt
a
wild
longing
to
kill
sidney
cremer
the
successful
and
to
smash
sidney
cremer
beautiful
new
car
chapter
sidney
cremer
chauffeur
no
letter
was
forwarded
to
the
hill
farm
from
the
theatre
at
bonnerstown
for
the
very
good
reason
that
miss
moon
having
found
one
for
gordon
opened
read
and
out
of
sheer
spite
destroyed
it
with
its
several
enclosures
the
envelope
was
addressed
in
bill
willing
inappropriately
beautiful
handwriting
and
there
was
a
short
note
from
him
saying
that
he
had
great
pleasure
in
enclosing
two
letters
just
arrived
from
england
also
that
he
sent
his
undying
love
to
lillie
de
lisle
one
of
the
english
letters
blazed
to
the
actress
dazzled
eyes
with
a
gilded
coronet
and
began
my
own
darling
val
how
can
you
ever
forgive
me
for
not
answering
your
poor
dear
cablegram
but
of
course
i
thought
it
was
from
that
horrible
wretch
foxham
it
seems
now
he
your
ticket
for
the
and
sailed
for
australia
all
sorts
of
reports
came
in
about
him
directly
after
you
must
have
sailed
and
i
learn
now
that
even
before
you
left
james
harborough
suspected
him
because
of
some
forged
cheque
he
heard
of
i
really
too
confused
and
upset
to
remember
how
or
when
or
what
but
in
any
case
it
was
remiss
of
james
not
to
have
instantly
warned
you
against
the
man
even
on
the
slightest
suspicion
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
coroneted
letter
which
had
no
paragraphs
and
very
few
punctuations
jealous
still
miss
moon
was
relieved
to
see
that
the
signature
was
your
adoring
mother
but
she
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
allusions
to
duchesses
and
other
persons
of
title
indeed
it
would
have
appeared
to
her
like
a
property
letter
to
be
read
on
the
stage
by
an
aristocratic
hero
of
melodrama
had
it
not
been
for
the
post
office
order
for
three
hundred
dollars
which
it
contained
it
was
a
genuine
order
as
miss
moon
might
have
been
inclined
to
prove
for
herself
if
she
had
had
any
hope
of
obtaining
the
money
which
she
had
not
therefore
the
next
best
thing
was
to
throw
the
document
into
the
fire
that
gordon
might
not
benefit
by
it
the
other
letter
enclosed
had
no
coronet
not
even
a
crest
but
the
paper
was
very
nice
smelled
faintly
of
spring
flowers
and
had
for
an
address
a
number
in
park
lane
which
miss
moon
had
read
of
in
english
novels
as
a
street
mostly
inhabited
by
elderly
millionaire
villains
who
persecuted
poor
but
beauteous
heroines
the
writing
was
pretty
and
the
letter
was
signed
your
affectionate
cousin
betty
at
the
end
was
a
postscript
in
a
different
hand
which
seemed
somehow
to
suit
the
rather
dashing
signature
jim
this
second
letter
was
even
more
difficult
than
the
first
for
an
uninitiated
person
to
understand
and
it
irritated
miss
moon
to
a
high
pitch
of
nervousness
cousin
betty
seemed
to
be
explaining
and
justifying
a
thing
that
jim
had
done
it
was
partly
a
joke
and
partly
earnest
but
it
had
a
good
motive
wrote
betty
i
guessed
the
morning
your
really
very
conceited
letter
about
the
new
york
introductions
came
that
jim
had
something
quaint
up
his
sleeve
to
spring
upon
you
when
you
arrived
in
america
but
i
did
know
what
to
tell
the
truth
val
i
was
even
more
disgusted
than
jim
by
your
cool
way
of
assuming
that
you
had
only
to
show
yourself
on
the
other
side
to
pick
and
choose
among
all
the
nicest
as
well
as
richest
girls
i
should
have
to
box
your
ears
and
i
said
course
we
wo
give
him
any
letters
and
i
tell
him
just
what
we
think
of
him
then
maybe
he
wo
go
but
jim
said
we
give
him
the
letters
and
he
shall
go
we
may
find
another
way
of
teaching
him
a
lesson
a
way
that
will
do
him
good
if
he
worth
being
done
good
to
that
was
all
and
as
jim
did
refer
to
the
subject
again
after
we
posted
the
letters
of
introduction
the
conversation
slipped
my
mind
i
did
think
any
more
about
it
until
weird
things
began
to
be
copied
into
london
papers
from
new
york
ones
and
your
mother
wired
jim
to
ask
what
if
anything
could
be
done
to
punish
foxham
you
see
she
thought
you
were
on
the
jim
soothed
all
her
worries
so
you
need
be
anxious
about
her
as
of
course
you
would
if
you
thought
she
been
alarmed
when
i
saw
paragraphs
in
the
papers
i
talked
to
jim
and
it
was
only
then
that
he
told
me
what
he
done
how
it
was
all
his
fault
really
and
he
was
very
sorry
because
everything
had
turned
out
a
lot
worse
for
you
than
ever
dreamed
of
wanting
it
to
be
took
a
hand
in
the
game
and
played
it
for
all
it
was
worth
jim
said
it
seems
that
foxham
your
man
asked
jim
to
cash
a
cheque
signed
by
you
one
night
not
long
ago
do
you
remember
when
he
and
i
were
at
battlemead
and
you
came
down
for
saturday
to
monday
jim
suspected
something
wrong
but
would
speak
to
you
till
he
made
sure
because
that
would
have
been
fair
and
foxham
was
such
an
invaluable
valet
a
few
days
later
when
jim
was
making
enquiries
about
the
man
he
found
out
that
the
horrid
creature
had
actually
impersonated
you
at
two
or
three
hotels
and
run
up
bills
in
your
name
it
was
the
very
evening
before
your
letter
about
america
came
that
jim
got
the
first
part
of
this
information
and
day
by
day
more
kept
coming
in
up
to
the
time
when
we
heard
foxham
had
given
you
notice
all
along
jim
was
thinking
out
the
idea
of
that
lesson
for
you
the
joke
that
was
to
be
half
in
earnest
and
then
when
vanderpot
could
sail
in
the
the
whole
plan
was
mapped
out
without
a
word
being
said
even
to
me
of
course
i
want
to
assure
you
again
and
jim
will
write
a
postscript
that
he
meant
nothing
worse
to
happen
to
you
than
a
disappointment
and
a
blow
to
your
conceit
he
telegraphed
to
several
of
the
people
to
whom
you
had
letters
saying
that
if
a
person
turned
up
calling
himself
by
your
name
the
landed
they
better
wait
and
make
sure
before
being
nice
to
you
that
were
your
own
absconding
valet
sailing
under
false
he
did
say
it
be
you
and
he
supposed
that
his
friends
would
simply
hang
back
for
a
few
days
making
no
sign
thus
giving
you
to
think
that
you
were
as
important
in
america
as
you
fancied
he
imagined
too
that
the
business
would
come
off
as
easily
as
you
expected
and
that
altogether
you
might
be
a
little
sobered
down
as
for
your
trouble
with
the
bank
we
know
now
that
is
what
happened
it
turns
out
that
henry
van
cotter
has
lately
become
a
partner
in
the
bank
which
corresponds
with
yours
in
london
and
having
got
jim
wire
about
the
valet
probably
at
the
same
time
when
instructions
arrived
from
the
london
and
southern
naturally
he
told
his
people
to
be
prepared
and
not
to
pay
how
could
jim
think
of
such
a
thing
happening
or
that
van
cotter
and
the
others
would
run
about
gossiping
of
what
he
told
them
as
a
mere
it
must
have
been
too
dreadful
for
you
at
the
hotel
and
as
for
that
milton
i
sure
he
is
a
then
it
was
another
that
neither
jim
nor
i
saw
the
newspapers
at
first
we
gone
off
on
a
motor
trip
as
the
weather
was
lovely
and
were
darting
all
about
cornwall
and
wales
starting
so
early
every
morning
and
not
arriving
at
hotels
till
so
late
at
night
that
we
did
bother
with
the
papers
for
nearly
a
week
of
course
the
minute
jim
knew
what
had
been
going
on
he
wired
everywhere
and
wrote
long
letters
of
explanation
too
a
little
earlier
than
he
originally
meant
to
put
an
end
to
the
misunderstanding
he
set
in
motion
but
meanwhile
you
disappeared
from
new
york
poor
dear
my
heart
quite
bleeds
for
you
and
yet
and
yet
i
wonder
if
all
that
you
gone
through
is
a
matter
for
regret
it
was
here
after
the
affectionate
cousin
betty
signature
that
the
other
handwriting
began
i
wonder
too
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
about
it
now
it
all
explained
and
you
see
just
where
and
how
much
i
to
blame
for
past
you
may
or
may
not
be
inclined
to
forgive
me
for
trying
to
play
providence
that
good
might
come
of
evil
but
if
there
are
any
things
which
you
do
regret
perhaps
you
partly
understand
yourself
and
me
anyhow
i
apologise
having
now
done
my
best
to
atone
in
case
you
want
to
go
back
to
new
york
in
a
blaze
of
glory
and
be
made
a
lion
of
meanwhile
i
await
your
verdict
and
am
as
the
writers
of
anonymous
letters
are
supposed
to
sign
themselves
friend
and
jim
again
fate
had
taken
a
hand
in
the
game
and
used
miss
moon
as
catspaw
into
the
fire
in
her
bedroom
at
bonnerstown
went
all
those
elaborate
explanations
and
loveland
did
not
dream
that
he
had
only
to
communicate
with
the
bank
in
new
york
to
receive
apologies
and
a
sum
of
money
which
after
his
vicissitudes
would
have
seemed
a
fortune
he
had
not
even
a
prophetic
pricking
in
his
thumbs
while
his
mother
post
office
order
for
three
hundred
dollars
sixty
pounds
gaily
burned
in
a
bonnerstown
stove
he
had
no
suspicion
that
new
york
society
or
an
important
section
of
it
was
wearing
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
his
account
no
instinct
told
him
that
even
while
the
letters
and
money
order
were
being
reduced
to
ashes
tony
kidd
was
concocting
a
glorious
story
about
the
marquis
of
loveland
which
would
ring
through
the
country
neither
did
he
know
that
lesley
dearmer
whether
believing
him
a
genuine
article
or
not
had
sent
him
an
anonymous
donation
which
lay
unclaimed
at
the
of
all
these
things
was
he
ignorant
and
lesley
sure
that
he
had
never
received
her
offering
would
have
seen
sidney
cremer
forty
gloria
burnt
before
her
eyes
rather
than
confess
what
she
had
done
nevertheless
she
was
enjoying
herself
very
much
and
if
chauffeur
went
about
with
an
unsmiling
face
it
did
not
depress
her
spirits
unless
for
a
minute
at
a
time
when
she
was
particularly
and
foolishly
she
knew
that
all
the
chauffeur
bodily
wants
were
being
well
cared
for
at
the
hill
farm
he
had
a
comfortable
bedroom
and
a
little
attached
in
the
far
corner
of
the
west
wing
which
was
the
newest
part
of
the
old
red
brick
house
she
did
not
suggest
his
wearing
the
costume
of
a
chauffeur
but
sent
him
by
uncle
wally
a
overcoat
and
motoring
cap
which
she
said
sidney
cremer
had
ordered
for
the
future
driver
of
his
car
gordon
meals
were
served
in
his
own
small
and
he
had
plenty
of
books
to
read
had
it
not
been
that
miss
dearmer
wished
to
drive
automobile
val
would
have
seen
little
of
her
but
she
took
two
lessons
a
day
her
aunt
loveland
sat
in
the
tonneau
dutifully
perhaps
cheerfully
playing
the
part
of
chaperon
after
lesley
had
experimented
a
little
and
become
proficient
enough
not
to
be
a
public
danger
but
the
girl
sat
in
the
driver
seat
with
cremer
temporary
chauffeur
beside
her
and
they
could
talk
of
what
they
chose
if
they
chose
to
talk
at
all
without
being
overheard
by
aunt
barbara
in
the
snug
shelter
of
the
limousine
loveland
wrote
to
the
theatre
at
bonnerstown
asking
the
manager
to
forward
anything
that
might
arrive
but
days
passed
on
and
nothing
came
this
was
not
strange
considering
miss
moon
bold
treatment
of
bill
fat
envelope
with
its
important
contents
but
it
seemed
strange
to
loveland
who
had
allowed
more
than
enough
time
for
letters
to
his
mother
and
betty
harborough
to
be
answered
and
forwarded
everything
in
his
life
of
late
was
so
extraordinary
however
that
to
find
his
expectations
fulfilled
in
a
commonplace
way
would
have
surprised
him
almost
more
than
having
them
blighted
besides
his
disappointment
at
not
hearing
from
home
was
not
as
poignant
as
it
had
been
he
had
kept
ten
dollars
for
himself
out
of
his
advance
of
salary
therefore
he
was
not
entirely
penniless
and
he
had
few
if
any
expenses
at
the
hill
farm
where
all
his
needs
were
as
carefully
considered
as
if
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
family
though
sidney
cremer
speedy
arrival
dangled
over
his
head
like
a
sharp
sword
which
might
fall
at
any
moment
and
cut
short
the
thread
of
his
happiness
while
it
lasted
the
thread
was
of
glistening
gold
he
could
not
be
sure
whether
lesley
dearmer
believed
in
him
as
lord
loveland
or
whether
she
really
thought
him
a
repentant
impostor
whom
she
was
befriending
and
trying
to
reform
but
she
was
unvaryingly
kind
and
the
subject
of
his
true
identity
was
not
further
discussed
he
was
too
proud
to
allude
to
and
force
it
upon
her
after
the
doubts
which
she
had
hinted
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
wish
to
bring
it
up
as
to
that
sweet
and
kindly
lady
who
was
chaperon
and
aunt
she
appeared
to
take
gordon
trustfully
for
granted
as
an
unfortunate
but
talented
young
gentleman
rescued
from
a
run
of
bad
luck
she
spoke
to
him
pleasantly
when
necessary
asked
polite
questions
now
and
then
about
the
car
or
his
personal
comfort
in
the
house
but
otherwise
seemed
to
regard
him
with
no
very
lively
interest
lesley
was
everything
to
her
she
adored
lesley
and
whatever
lesley
did
or
wished
to
do
was
perfect
in
her
eyes
therefore
it
was
not
odd
that
she
should
accept
the
transplanted
actor
as
one
of
lesley
lucky
finds
in
the
house
he
and
miss
dearmer
had
no
intercourse
and
he
did
not
even
know
what
the
girl
daily
occupations
were
or
what
visitors
she
saw
but
at
least
three
hours
out
of
every
gave
her
to
him
as
an
intimate
companion
near
in
mind
and
body
therefore
until
the
hateful
cremer
should
fall
out
of
a
clear
sky
val
was
not
eager
for
home
news
which
would
leave
no
excuse
for
lingering
at
this
old
homestead
in
the
blue
grass
country
though
he
was
a
paid
employé
the
hill
farm
seemed
to
him
the
pleasantest
place
in
which
he
had
ever
lived
not
excepting
any
splendid
and
well
ordered
country
mansion
where
he
had
been
a
flattered
member
of
a
house
party
ways
at
the
hill
farm
were
simple
ways
and
there
was
no
grandeur
no
display
in
the
quaint
rambling
red
brick
house
all
the
servants
were
coloured
and
were
either
elderly
men
and
women
who
had
served
the
family
before
the
war
which
freed
them
from
slavery
or
else
young
sons
and
daughters
of
the
old
servitors
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
about
the
place
indoors
and
out
so
many
that
loveland
could
hardly
tell
one
face
from
another
but
they
were
all
kindly
dark
faces
that
brightened
into
glittering
grins
at
sight
of
the
english
chauffeur
everything
was
done
on
a
lavish
though
far
from
pretentious
scale
but
the
ordering
of
the
establishment
might
mean
wealth
or
might
mean
no
more
than
a
comfortable
competence
the
furniture
was
good
and
in
the
best
of
taste
but
it
was
almost
all
antique
brought
from
england
by
ancestors
of
loveland
or
lesley
dearmer
perhaps
in
that
good
time
when
chippendale
and
sheraton
treasures
were
regarded
as
ordinary
possessions
in
the
stables
were
a
couple
of
beautiful
hunters
lesley
property
for
loveland
soon
discovered
that
a
true
daughter
of
kentucky
considers
it
a
disgrace
to
the
county
for
every
girl
not
to
be
a
fearless
and
accomplished
rider
there
were
two
fat
old
carriage
horses
also
and
other
animals
for
the
farm
work
which
was
carried
on
by
a
married
couple
altogether
it
was
clear
that
milton
and
cadwallader
hunter
estimate
of
the
ladies
circumstances
had
been
unjust
loveland
and
her
niece
were
not
teachers
taking
a
holiday
while
their
money
lasted
perhaps
the
farm
and
the
money
were
all
loveland
but
lesley
had
told
val
on
ship
board
that
she
earned
enough
for
by
writing
stories
therefore
she
was
not
in
any
case
entirely
dependent
upon
her
aunt
and
it
was
evident
that
the
girl
and
the
elderly
lady
were
very
content
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
call
them
it
seemed
to
val
that
lesley
was
always
happy
and
because
she
was
happy
herself
she
could
not
bear
to
see
others
sad
or
unfortunate
though
she
asked
no
questions
about
her
chauffeur
english
past
she
showed
frank
interest
in
his
american
experiences
she
led
him
on
as
they
spun
through
the
country
side
by
side
to
talk
of
bill
willing
of
lillie
de
lisle
of
ed
binney
and
even
of
isidora
the
of
the
fire
at
alexander
the
great
she
had
read
in
the
papers
and
she
deigned
a
few
words
of
praise
for
loveland
behaviour
she
was
curious
also
to
hear
what
happened
afterwards
and
though
val
was
silent
as
to
isidora
part
in
his
next
move
woman
wit
supplied
the
missing
link
too
to
put
her
suspicions
into
words
lesley
nevertheless
contrived
tactfully
to
pluck
from
loveland
some
scanty
information
concerning
miss
alexander
to
the
jewish
commercial
traveller
she
never
marry
him
the
girl
announced
authoritatively
i
wish
i
could
think
you
were
right
said
loveland
poor
isidora
has
a
warm
generous
heart
and
it
would
be
a
beastly
shame
to
waste
her
on
the
oily
creature
but
alexander
hard
to
beat
once
he
makes
up
his
mind
when
i
first
knew
you
it
would
have
occurred
to
you
that
the
affairs
of
a
common
little
person
like
that
might
be
worth
bothering
about
exclaimed
lesley
but
now
i
believe
you
really
interested
i
really
am
admitted
val
i
hope
that
does
disgust
you
exactly
the
other
way
lesley
assured
him
but
you
need
be
anxious
an
only
daughter
spoiled
by
her
father
is
just
as
to
beat
as
the
most
obstinate
and
tyrannical
old
parent
isidora
marry
the
cohen
man
after
all
that
happened
she
wo
marry
anyone
for
a
good
long
time
but
bye
and
bye
she
will
and
then
it
will
be
somebody
of
her
own
choosing
not
her
father
what
makes
you
think
so
asked
loveland
oh
because
i
a
woman
myself
and
then
she
would
say
no
more
on
that
subject
but
she
talked
eagerly
of
bill
willing
and
his
star
sidney
cremer
would
play
fairy
godfather
to
the
two
she
said
speaking
with
that
happy
certainty
of
her
lover
mind
which
invariably
depressed
and
irritated
loveland
there
were
numerous
country
companies
on
the
road
touring
with
sidney
pieces
in
very
good
towns
sidney
would
take
gordon
word
for
lillie
de
lisle
ability
as
a
soubrette
and
would
offer
her
a
part
shortly
to
be
open
owing
to
the
marriage
of
the
girl
now
playing
it
as
for
that
perfect
lamb
of
a
bill
a
place
should
be
found
for
him
in
the
same
company
that
lesley
would
promise
he
could
travel
as
a
sort
of
handy
man
to
repaint
and
freshen
up
the
scenery
and
as
sidney
would
doubtless
guarantee
the
pair
a
permanent
engagement
together
they
could
marry
at
once
on
the
strength
of
it
you
had
better
wait
and
hear
what
cremer
says
suggested
loveland
almost
bitterly
when
lesley
had
instructed
him
to
write
the
good
news
at
once
to
lillie
and
bill
ed
binney
was
also
to
be
provided
for
sent
to
a
convalescent
home
and
given
hope
for
a
chance
as
property
man
with
one
of
sidney
plays
when
he
should
be
strong
enough
to
go
on
tour
again
oh
sidney
and
i
always
think
alike
have
i
told
you
that
before
was
lesley
answer
there
no
need
to
wait
i
know
all
about
business
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
you
to
write
and
be
the
means
of
making
your
friends
happy
so
it
would
if
i
the
means
muttered
loveland
but
i
not
it
sidney
cremer
everything
is
sidney
cremer
and
he
is
everything
some
day
i
may
remind
you
of
that
speech
said
lesley
then
she
laughed
in
a
mysterious
little
way
she
had
but
she
was
determined
that
loveland
should
write
the
letters
she
desired
written
and
learning
the
lesson
of
unselfishness
he
tried
to
rejoice
sincerely
in
his
good
luck
it
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
he
said
to
himself
as
he
sealed
letters
which
would
change
the
face
of
the
world
for
three
persons
their
turning
has
come
at
last
and
i
glad
but
my
lane
is
blocked
whatever
happens
that
brute
sidney
cremer
will
always
stand
at
the
end
and
bar
my
way
out
chapter
in
the
car
together
it
was
the
day
after
val
had
sent
off
the
joyful
tidings
to
his
friends
in
the
big
world
beyond
the
hill
farm
that
tidings
from
the
big
world
came
to
him
thanks
to
miss
moon
the
letters
from
home
were
lost
but
greatly
as
that
lady
would
have
delighted
in
so
sweeping
a
measure
it
was
impossible
to
keep
gordon
for
ever
in
the
dark
by
destroying
whole
issues
of
new
york
journals
uncle
wally
was
in
the
habit
of
bringing
the
gentleman
chauffeur
his
breakfast
and
with
that
meal
which
consisted
of
delicious
southern
dishes
the
morning
paper
loveland
did
not
find
american
news
particularly
exciting
and
as
a
rule
merely
glanced
through
the
paper
as
he
ate
but
new
york
light
had
a
special
interest
for
him
he
associated
it
not
only
with
his
first
american
adventures
but
with
tony
kidd
for
whom
he
felt
a
queer
friendly
sort
of
regard
since
their
work
together
and
their
short
chat
afterwards
at
alexander
the
great
if
val
were
to
be
righted
in
the
eyes
of
new
york
he
had
the
idea
that
it
would
be
through
the
pen
of
tony
kidd
which
had
once
blackened
him
with
so
scandalous
a
spatter
of
ink
miss
dearmer
or
loveland
subscribed
for
the
sunday
edition
of
new
york
light
and
today
was
monday
the
paper
had
arrived
and
as
loveland
rose
early
to
attend
to
the
car
with
far
more
alacrity
than
he
had
ever
risen
for
guard
mounting
at
home
it
appeared
that
he
was
to
have
first
chance
at
the
news
his
eyes
lighted
with
a
certain
interest
as
he
saw
the
paper
laid
conspicuously
on
the
breakfast
tray
for
this
was
his
first
monday
at
the
hill
farm
and
consequently
his
first
sight
of
the
new
york
sunday
paper
i
suppose
the
ladies
wo
be
wanting
this
for
a
few
minutes
yet
no
sah
ole
miss
nevah
looks
at
de
papahs
till
brekfus
and
young
miss
was
writin
late
las
night
so
she
wo
be
ringin
yet
awhile
i
reckon
said
the
darkey
who
had
been
a
slave
when
loveland
was
a
child
val
laid
aside
the
louisville
monday
paper
and
began
to
read
new
york
light
suddenly
he
cried
out
an
excited
by
jove
and
forgot
that
he
had
not
finished
his
breakfast
but
as
by
this
time
uncle
wally
had
gone
there
was
nobody
to
be
surprised
by
his
emotion
yes
it
had
come
at
last
his
justification
and
even
his
triumph
for
the
story
as
told
by
tony
kidd
made
it
seem
almost
a
triumph
indeed
he
had
hardly
realised
himself
how
dramatic
it
all
was
until
he
saw
the
printed
account
of
what
he
had
gone
through
bill
willing
had
been
interviewed
at
the
bat
hotel
of
which
a
graphic
sketch
and
description
were
given
alexander
the
great
had
been
interviewed
and
thus
secured
another
free
advertisement
for
the
red
restaurant
isidora
had
been
interviewed
and
photographed
in
her
best
hat
and
last
though
far
from
least
henry
van
cotter
had
been
interviewed
from
him
it
seemed
tony
kidd
had
got
on
the
trail
of
the
truth
van
cotter
friend
jim
harborough
had
wired
from
london
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
about
the
valet
impersonating
the
marquis
of
loveland
a
mistake
which
had
partly
arisen
through
the
sailing
of
lord
loveland
on
the
instead
of
the
as
expected
the
valet
had
sailed
for
australia
but
would
be
arrested
at
the
first
port
and
it
was
the
marquis
of
loveland
himself
whom
fate
and
society
had
hounded
out
of
new
york
where
is
lord
loveland
was
one
of
the
several
sensational
headlines
with
which
tony
had
ornamented
his
article
for
though
bill
willing
had
told
of
the
episode
he
did
not
yet
know
and
therefore
could
not
tell
even
if
he
would
his
swell
friend
present
address
so
great
and
even
touching
was
tony
eloquence
that
tears
had
fallen
from
bright
eyes
for
loveland
sorrows
and
the
most
tears
from
the
brightest
eyes
were
those
shed
by
fanny
milton
never
had
she
liked
tony
half
as
well
as
on
that
sunday
morning
when
she
read
what
loveland
read
the
following
day
and
as
tony
had
shrewdly
guessed
at
her
feelings
he
thought
that
he
could
not
make
a
wiser
move
than
to
call
at
milton
house
on
sunday
evening
milton
was
out
but
fanny
was
at
home
and
such
was
her
gratitude
to
the
journalist
for
his
championship
of
her
hero
that
before
tony
left
her
he
had
won
more
than
half
the
promise
he
wanted
loveland
however
was
not
thinking
of
fanny
milton
but
of
lesley
dearmer
now
that
he
had
come
into
his
own
again
he
could
no
doubt
somehow
get
money
almost
at
once
on
that
unlucky
letter
of
credit
pay
back
the
advance
miss
dearmer
had
made
him
cease
to
be
a
gentleman
chauffeur
leave
the
hill
farm
and
return
to
new
york
to
be
a
gentleman
at
large
but
there
was
no
joy
in
the
thought
of
ceasing
to
be
a
chauffeur
and
still
less
in
that
of
leaving
the
hill
farm
the
play
was
played
out
and
the
adventure
was
over
but
life
could
not
be
as
it
had
been
for
loveland
he
could
not
take
up
the
old
life
or
the
old
self
where
he
had
dropped
both
one
night
in
central
park
he
was
a
different
man
in
these
days
caring
for
different
things
and
unfortunately
the
thing
he
cared
for
most
was
the
one
thing
he
could
not
have
lesley
dearmer
love
he
had
wanted
it
from
the
first
though
not
enough
just
at
the
first
to
try
for
it
at
the
risk
of
great
now
he
would
have
counted
no
sacrifice
too
great
if
it
could
give
him
that
which
once
he
had
not
known
how
to
value
worthily
being
once
more
lord
loveland
and
having
a
repentant
new
york
at
his
feet
would
not
give
him
lesley
dearmer
by
this
time
his
mother
must
have
written
he
thought
and
betty
too
though
the
bonnerstown
secret
was
hidden
from
him
he
believed
letters
had
been
sent
all
ought
soon
to
be
right
with
him
in
the
best
of
possible
worlds
but
because
there
was
also
a
sidney
cremer
in
that
world
nothing
could
be
wholly
right
even
for
lord
loveland
while
he
was
thinking
how
good
it
would
have
been
were
fate
a
better
stage
manager
to
justify
himself
to
lesley
lesley
sent
for
him
by
uncle
wally
to
her
he
was
still
the
chauffeur
and
the
darkey
who
politely
delivered
the
message
announced
that
young
miss
would
be
obliged
to
massah
gordon
if
he
would
take
her
out
in
the
car
as
quick
as
possible
loveland
flung
aside
light
and
uncle
wally
let
it
lie
neglected
where
it
fell
probably
he
thought
that
young
miss
was
too
impatient
for
an
early
to
care
about
wasting
a
moment
on
a
newspaper
as
loveland
looked
over
the
gloria
making
her
purr
pleasantly
in
preparation
for
the
run
he
tried
to
decide
definitely
what
to
do
next
if
he
flaunted
his
public
justification
in
lesley
face
there
would
no
longer
be
an
excuse
to
remain
a
chauffeur
and
no
doubt
the
girl
would
think
as
much
if
he
did
not
propose
to
leave
because
of
her
engagement
to
sidney
cremer
he
could
not
beg
lesley
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
go
to
england
with
him
as
his
wife
yet
the
thought
of
going
back
without
her
of
never
seeing
her
again
in
this
world
impaled
loveland
on
the
sharp
prongs
of
pain
since
he
had
known
the
girl
in
her
own
home
it
seemed
that
his
first
love
for
her
had
hardly
deserved
the
name
of
love
so
much
more
did
he
love
her
now
face
to
face
with
the
certainty
of
separation
and
her
marriage
with
another
man
every
hour
spent
with
the
loved
one
became
a
priceless
treasure
he
resolved
not
only
to
be
silent
about
the
article
in
new
york
light
but
to
go
back
to
his
room
and
carefully
hide
the
newspaper
this
he
did
delighted
to
find
the
big
budget
lying
on
the
floor
where
he
had
left
it
of
course
lesley
or
loveland
might
enquire
for
light
and
learn
that
it
had
last
been
seen
on
his
breakfast
table
but
it
would
not
seem
a
miracle
that
a
newspaper
should
be
mislaid
and
there
was
a
chance
that
louisville
journals
might
not
have
space
to
feature
lord
loveland
affairs
as
lesley
had
elected
to
make
an
early
expedition
it
was
almost
certain
that
she
would
not
have
looked
at
a
paper
and
if
she
had
skimmed
one
over
she
might
easily
have
missed
a
paragraph
here
and
there
at
worst
loveland
felt
sure
of
this
morning
with
her
on
the
old
terms
if
she
said
nothing
afterwards
he
too
would
simply
be
mute
until
sidney
cremer
arrival
when
cremer
was
in
the
house
he
would
be
glad
to
go
and
glad
to
prove
to
lesley
before
going
that
he
was
all
he
had
once
claimed
to
be
when
the
car
was
ready
he
drove
to
the
front
door
and
found
lesley
tying
on
her
motor
veil
a
charming
picture
set
in
a
rustic
frame
loveland
spirits
rose
when
he
saw
that
she
was
alone
auntie
in
the
limousine
was
the
least
obtrusive
of
chaperons
still
there
was
joy
in
having
the
girl
to
himself
for
a
wonder
i
could
sleep
last
night
said
lesley
and
i
thought
an
early
spin
in
the
car
would
clear
my
brain
of
cobwebs
i
hope
you
do
mind
being
routed
out
at
an
unearthly
hour
loveland
would
have
liked
to
answer
that
it
was
unearthly
only
because
it
gave
him
the
companionship
of
a
being
divine
but
chauffeurs
even
gentlemen
chauffeurs
do
not
make
such
remarks
to
their
employers
still
less
to
the
fiancées
of
their
employers
he
merely
said
therefore
that
he
was
sorry
to
hear
miss
dearmer
had
not
slept
and
was
pleased
to
take
her
out
at
any
hour
uncle
wally
told
me
he
added
that
you
been
writing
late
last
night
not
exactly
writing
explained
lesley
finishing
the
chiffon
bow
under
her
chin
with
dainty
elaboration
i
was
looking
over
an
act
of
a
new
play
which
sidney
has
begun
perhaps
that
excited
me
anyway
i
tossed
for
hours
thinking
of
a
thousand
things
when
i
might
better
have
been
dreaming
and
then
i
was
waked
at
seven
by
a
telegram
and
sleep
again
something
in
her
eyes
gleaming
like
fairy
jewels
under
an
enchanted
lake
as
they
shone
through
the
filmy
veil
made
val
miserably
sure
that
cremer
had
sent
the
telegram
but
he
was
becoming
outwardly
quite
a
servant
and
only
under
the
greatest
provocation
could
he
be
goaded
into
asking
impertinent
questions
shall
i
drive
this
morning
miss
dearmer
or
will
you
he
enquired
trying
to
erase
all
expression
from
his
face
perhaps
you
better
at
first
i
almost
too
nervous
she
said
bye
and
bye
we
shall
see
she
let
him
help
her
into
the
car
and
even
the
touch
of
a
thick
knitted
mitten
was
electric
for
loveland
then
he
took
the
seat
by
her
side
and
sent
the
gloria
spinning
down
the
avenue
towards
the
gate
you
heard
nothing
from
your
people
yet
asked
lesley
after
a
few
minutes
silence
while
they
flew
along
a
road
smooth
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
generations
not
yet
replied
val
but
i
daresay
something
will
be
forwarded
from
bonnerstown
theatre
in
a
day
or
two
i
told
you
i
written
to
the
manager
there
giving
this
address
for
bill
would
have
sent
on
to
bonnerstown
anything
that
came
for
me
to
his
care
in
new
york
yes
you
told
me
said
lesley
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
had
good
news
because
because
of
something
in
your
telegram
loveland
could
not
resist
breaking
into
the
slight
pause
she
made
yes
indirectly
dear
me
gordon
do
you
think
you
went
round
that
corner
too
fast
did
i
asked
loveland
i
sorry
i
did
notice
what
an
alarming
confession
from
one
chauffeur
oh
and
that
you
nearly
ran
over
it
i
believe
your
nerves
must
be
a
little
too
i
think
i
could
drive
almost
as
well
as
that
myself
i
deserve
to
be
scolded
said
loveland
i
afraid
i
was
for
an
instant
though
the
chicken
did
seem
worried
about
itself
kentucky
chickens
never
do
they
so
take
of
that
baby
pig
gordon
i
think
i
will
drive
for
awhile
after
all
if
you
do
mind
delighted
said
loveland
in
a
mood
to
rejoice
if
the
girl
upset
the
car
and
killed
them
both
because
it
would
be
so
much
more
agreeable
to
go
out
of
the
world
with
her
than
to
remain
in
it
while
she
became
lost
to
him
as
cremer
he
put
on
the
brakes
and
stopped
the
car
which
panted
impatiently
by
the
roadside
while
lesley
and
he
changed
places
the
way
was
straight
and
fairly
level
with
no
sudden
risings
and
fallings
or
intricate
twistings
and
turnings
therefore
no
reason
existed
why
lesley
should
not
show
her
newly
acquired
skill
she
began
cautiously
but
in
a
few
moments
put
the
forty
gloria
on
fourth
speed
throttling
her
down
to
a
pace
within
reason
there
are
you
proud
of
your
pupil
the
girl
asked
gaily
very
proud
answered
loveland
and
do
you
think
i
should
be
able
to
get
on
without
much
more
teaching
from
a
real
expert
oh
yes
with
a
decent
sort
of
chauffeur
to
do
your
repairs
you
can
drive
the
car
through
country
like
this
without
danger
unless
i
get
yes
unless
you
get
but
why
should
you
be
when
so
soon
you
have
the
person
you
care
for
most
sitting
beside
you
where
i
sit
now
oh
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
for
saying
such
things
miss
dearmer
but
you
see
you
and
i
were
once
friends
not
employer
and
servant
so
i
forget
myself
sometimes
and
besides
i
help
thinking
this
morning
that
you
leading
up
to
saying
something
which
perhaps
you
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
say
yet
why
should
it
be
difficult
for
you
to
tell
me
if
you
heard
that
cremer
coming
at
once
and
bringing
another
chauffeur
my
telegram
did
say
that
but
it
made
me
feel
that
i
sha
be
able
to
keep
you
very
long
at
the
hill
farm
said
lesley
gone
was
the
elaborate
scheme
for
staying
on
at
any
cost
she
wanted
him
to
go
she
was
hinting
for
him
to
go
i
can
leave
whenever
you
like
to
get
rid
of
me
returned
val
his
tone
roughened
made
almost
brutal
by
his
effort
to
hide
the
sharp
pain
he
suffered
oh
do
think
i
feel
like
that
exclaimed
lesley
eagerly
so
eagerly
that
in
her
excitement
she
did
the
very
thing
she
had
reproached
loveland
for
doing
she
forgot
that
a
person
controlling
a
powerful
is
ill
advised
to
be
in
earnest
about
anything
except
the
business
in
hand
they
were
approaching
a
somewhat
abrupt
turn
in
the
road
at
the
moment
lesley
chose
to
assure
loveland
that
she
did
mean
to
hurt
his
feelings
being
genuinely
sorry
for
the
effect
her
words
produced
she
did
not
realise
until
too
late
that
the
corner
would
expect
her
to
slow
down
before
turning
it
had
she
been
an
experienced
driver
the
right
action
would
have
been
mechanical
but
as
it
was
she
discovered
with
a
quick
rush
of
blood
to
her
heart
that
she
could
not
check
the
speed
in
time
she
tried
to
make
up
for
her
mistake
by
a
feat
of
accurate
steering
but
the
task
was
beyond
her
powers
the
big
gloria
swung
round
the
curve
on
two
wheels
refused
to
take
the
new
direction
and
bounded
gaily
off
the
road
across
a
ditch
and
into
a
meadow
chapter
forty
the
other
side
of
the
moon
the
next
thing
that
loveland
knew
he
was
sitting
in
a
bog
which
felt
quite
soft
and
comfortable
so
comfortable
that
he
at
first
believed
himself
to
be
in
bed
waking
out
of
a
bad
dream
then
with
a
flash
he
remembered
all
that
had
happened
and
scrambled
up
in
a
cold
sweat
of
fear
for
lesley
he
was
dripping
with
water
and
mossy
mud
but
though
his
limbs
felt
heavy
and
he
staggered
a
little
his
temples
throbbing
as
if
his
brain
were
propelled
by
a
steam
engine
he
was
hardly
conscious
that
his
own
body
still
existed
his
one
thought
was
of
the
girl
a
cataract
of
sparks
which
showered
before
his
eyes
dimmed
his
sight
at
first
but
in
a
moment
he
saw
a
slight
figure
lying
limply
on
the
ground
not
far
away
as
for
the
which
rested
on
its
side
at
a
little
distance
its
pleasant
purring
stilled
loveland
had
forgotten
all
about
it
lesley
he
cried
as
he
ran
to
her
lesley
but
she
neither
stirred
nor
answered
down
he
dropped
on
both
knees
beside
her
and
raised
her
head
upon
his
arm
her
eyes
were
closed
and
through
the
chiffon
veil
he
could
see
the
long
lashes
dark
on
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
illustration
he
dropped
on
both
knees
beside
her
and
raised
her
head
upon
his
the
ground
where
she
lay
was
spongy
after
a
day
of
heavy
rain
which
had
soaked
through
the
thick
carpet
of
dead
grass
deeply
into
the
earth
the
girl
position
was
easy
giving
loveland
the
hope
that
no
bones
were
broken
and
there
was
no
stain
of
blood
on
the
white
face
or
the
soft
brown
hair
but
she
lay
very
still
there
was
no
flutter
of
the
eyelashes
no
faint
gasping
for
breath
sick
with
fear
that
she
might
be
dead
loveland
memory
refused
the
barrier
between
them
he
was
conscious
only
of
his
love
for
her
and
his
passionate
remorse
for
the
wish
harboured
for
a
moment
the
wish
that
she
might
let
something
happen
to
the
car
and
that
they
two
might
go
out
of
the
world
together
there
was
no
torture
which
he
would
not
have
prayed
to
suffer
now
if
through
it
he
could
even
hope
to
bring
her
back
to
life
dearest
precious
one
darling
he
called
her
for
god
sake
wake
up
speak
to
me
only
speak
to
me
i
love
you
so
instantly
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
shivering
a
little
in
his
arms
and
looked
up
at
him
half
dazedly
at
first
then
smiling
as
a
woman
might
who
has
dreamed
of
a
distant
lover
and
wakes
to
find
him
near
thank
god
you
not
dead
he
stammered
and
that
not
she
answered
faintly
you
you
not
much
hurt
not
at
all
and
if
i
were
it
would
matter
loveland
assured
her
fervently
if
only
i
had
let
you
drive
or
if
i
had
talked
to
you
it
all
my
fault
what
shall
i
do
if
you
injured
i
i
all
right
and
and
rather
happy
whispered
lesley
i
think
anything
the
matter
at
all
except
a
little
shock
let
me
lift
you
up
for
a
minute
so
that
we
can
make
sure
whether
you
are
hurt
said
val
i
do
it
so
gently
no
i
rather
lie
still
just
as
i
am
the
girl
answered
would
you
be
more
comfortable
if
i
laid
your
head
on
the
ground
no
keep
it
on
your
arm
please
i
like
it
there
said
lesley
and
loveland
was
made
so
happy
by
the
words
and
by
the
sudden
revulsion
from
despair
to
hope
that
he
could
have
broken
down
and
sobbed
i
feel
as
if
i
been
dreaming
she
murmured
on
i
dreamed
that
you
that
you
called
me
that
you
said
you
loved
me
forgive
me
exclaimed
loveland
i
could
help
it
i
was
half
mad
then
it
was
a
dream
no
it
was
a
dream
he
confessed
even
though
you
think
me
an
impostor
you
ca
believe
me
a
wholly
unredeemed
villain
or
you
would
have
taken
me
into
your
house
for
charity
sake
though
it
was
so
you
must
know
now
that
you
nothing
to
fear
from
my
love
is
it
real
love
tell
me
she
asked
her
head
nestling
comfortably
against
his
arm
it
the
realest
thing
about
me
it
grown
to
be
the
whole
of
me
loveland
broke
out
nothing
else
matters
that
why
i
should
have
had
to
kill
myself
if
you
been
hurt
or
but
i
ca
speak
of
it
thank
god
you
alive
and
not
injured
yes
that
enough
for
me
it
got
to
be
enough
and
i
ought
to
be
happy
though
you
going
to
belong
to
another
man
would
have
wanted
to
marry
me
any
way
said
lesley
i
would
have
wanted
to
when
it
the
thing
i
give
all
but
one
year
of
my
life
for
the
one
year
i
keep
to
be
happy
in
with
you
just
a
poor
little
humble
story
writer
and
you
would
really
like
to
marry
it
do
torture
me
said
loveland
i
had
about
all
i
can
stand
if
i
were
the
impostor
you
think
me
i
think
you
an
impostor
replied
lesley
beginning
to
speak
in
quite
a
natural
tone
of
voice
again
though
she
kept
the
support
of
loveland
arm
i
never
said
i
did
i
only
asked
you
once
why
i
should
have
more
faith
in
you
than
others
had
but
i
be
ready
to
take
you
on
faith
if
you
were
ready
to
take
me
without
a
fortune
the
blood
rushed
to
loveland
face
which
had
been
pale
and
drawn
is
it
true
do
you
mean
it
he
stammered
you
care
for
me
a
little
a
great
deal
said
lesley
too
much
i
used
to
think
on
the
ship
but
i
do
think
so
now
because
you
different
it
the
real
you
i
loved
all
the
time
the
miracle
happened
you
know
seeing
the
other
side
of
the
but
would
it
be
doing
you
an
injury
to
marry
you
when
you
and
your
family
counted
on
a
great
heiress
it
was
the
other
who
had
the
sense
to
see
what
a
beastly
caddish
thing
it
would
be
to
marry
a
girl
just
because
she
was
rich
a
girl
i
did
love
val
hurried
on
oh
lesley
you
not
playing
with
me
are
you
i
could
marry
any
other
woman
but
you
what
about
the
old
family
home
that
tumbling
to
ruin
it
will
have
to
tumble
and
your
family
there
only
my
mother
and
what
she
wants
most
is
my
happiness
my
love
for
you
has
somehow
shown
me
how
to
appreciate
her
more
but
lesley
what
about
sidney
cremer
do
you
care
enough
for
me
a
man
you
say
you
on
faith
to
give
up
all
cremer
money
and
to
throw
him
over
for
my
sake
i
ca
throw
him
over
then
how
can
we
be
married
and
i
ca
give
up
his
money
she
added
lesley
have
you
raised
me
up
only
to
let
me
fall
deeper
into
the
pit
than
ever
we
both
fell
into
the
pit
together
did
we
she
said
laughing
a
little
if
you
go
deeper
i
go
deeper
too
for
we
going
to
stand
or
fall
together
now
then
what
do
you
mean
asked
val
you
have
to
send
one
of
us
away
me
or
sidney
cremer
let
me
sit
up
and
we
talk
it
over
said
lesley
with
a
quaint
cheerfulness
and
that
utterly
bewildered
loveland
i
feel
so
well
and
so
happy
now
that
i
believe
i
can
find
my
way
out
of
any
entanglement
so
long
as
we
go
hand
in
hand
and
sitting
on
the
wet
grass
in
her
thick
fur
coat
she
twisted
herself
so
lithely
about
that
there
could
no
longer
be
any
fear
of
obscure
injuries
val
resting
on
one
knee
took
the
little
grey
mitten
that
she
held
out
to
him
and
pressed
the
hand
in
it
but
there
was
bitterness
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
this
is
an
entanglement
that
you
find
no
way
out
of
you
ca
keep
us
both
you
do
trust
me
lesley
reproached
him
just
wait
before
deciding
to
give
me
up
until
we
thoroughly
thrashed
things
out
beginning
at
the
beginning
and
going
right
on
to
the
end
i
sha
decide
to
give
you
up
nothing
can
make
me
do
that
now
loveland
said
it
cremer
who
have
to
go
to
the
wall
lesley
laughed
like
his
motor
poor
car
i
sorry
for
it
but
it
has
sacrificed
itself
in
vain
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
on
earth
to
bring
all
this
about
that
was
what
kept
me
awake
last
night
if
i
to
tell
the
whole
truth
it
to
come
some
way
and
it
had
to
come
soon
well
sidney
has
solved
the
difficulty
and
sidney
will
be
glad
for
my
happiness
is
the
same
to
him
as
his
own
and
now
i
gone
so
far
i
may
as
well
confess
that
from
the
very
minute
i
saw
you
play
bob
in
that
dingy
little
hall
at
ashville
i
hoped
oh
but
hoped
more
than
that
you
would
ask
me
to
marry
you
please
please
do
be
shocked
but
i
invited
you
to
come
here
just
for
that
loveland
was
utterly
at
sea
or
would
have
been
if
her
hand
had
not
lain
in
his
and
if
she
had
not
begged
him
to
wait
and
trust
her
yet
you
were
engaged
to
sidney
cremer
he
said
half
to
himself
i
was
bound
to
sidney
just
as
i
am
now
and
just
as
i
have
been
for
the
last
three
years
and
i
was
tired
of
him
then
not
a
bit
and
not
even
at
this
minute
but
i
love
the
real
you
darling
exclaimed
loveland
yet
he
marvelled
at
her
this
was
a
phase
of
the
girl
character
her
true
and
noble
character
which
he
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
were
very
cold
to
me
that
night
at
ashville
he
ventured
to
say
i
was
trying
you
i
was
quite
sure
you
see
which
side
of
the
moon
i
was
looking
at
and
if
after
all
it
was
only
the
same
old
side
i
did
want
to
let
myself
be
dazzled
by
it
as
i
could
help
being
at
first
oh
but
do
misunderstand
me
it
was
the
reflected
light
the
light
of
a
high
position
that
had
dazzled
me
that
never
mattered
it
was
a
different
light
a
light
that
never
shone
on
land
or
sea
but
shines
just
once
they
say
in
every
woman
life
that
means
what
i
said
before
that
i
was
in
love
with
you
on
the
boat
even
when
i
laughed
at
your
talk
of
love
i
felt
more
like
crying
than
laughing
though
because
the
sort
of
love
you
gave
me
in
return
for
mine
worth
my
having
i
was
too
good
for
it
heaven
knows
you
were
val
admitted
humbly
but
i
not
too
good
no
not
good
enough
for
what
you
give
me
now
and
that
why
i
so
frightfully
happy
and
delighted
that
motor
jumped
over
conventionalities
instead
of
my
having
to
take
the
leap
myself
instead
i
just
leaped
with
the
car
and
you
leaped
too
and
everything
is
going
to
be
heavenly
for
all
the
rest
of
our
lives
i
do
quite
see
how
if
you
not
tired
of
cremer
said
loveland
do
be
jealous
of
sidney
any
more
i
liked
making
you
a
little
jealous
of
him
at
first
after
i
saw
how
you
felt
it
was
fun
for
me
and
i
thought
it
was
good
for
you
but
now
it
different
sure
about
the
other
side
of
the
moon
and
i
want
you
to
be
as
happy
as
i
am
oh
do
speak
yet
i
must
go
on
a
little
further
you
know
i
told
you
i
had
a
telegram
this
morning
yes
yes
well
you
thought
it
was
from
sidney
cremer
and
i
did
contradict
lots
of
things
you
thought
lately
i
let
you
go
on
thinking
without
contradicting
the
telegram
was
from
little
fanny
milton
about
you
about
me
she
knew
from
a
journalist
who
is
a
friend
of
hers
that
you
come
to
this
part
of
the
country
with
a
theatrical
troupe
and
they
found
out
that
the
actors
were
playing
pieces
of
sidney
cremer
at
ashville
they
talked
it
over
together
fanny
and
this
kidd
he
wanted
to
know
for
his
paper
sake
where
you
disappeared
to
when
the
company
broke
up
last
evening
he
suggested
that
she
should
telegraph
to
me
they
both
thought
i
might
have
heard
about
you
so
that
why
i
felt
that
you
would
be
stopping
on
as
my
chauffeur
very
long
did
miss
milton
say
in
the
telegram
that
new
york
had
discovered
its
mistake
about
me
no
she
did
say
that
though
it
was
a
long
telegram
i
expect
she
thought
i
would
have
seen
the
newspapers
well
i
have
but
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
quite
nicely
and
i
was
sure
that
you
come
into
your
own
again
with
the
great
american
public
perhaps
partly
through
fanny
milton
kidd
i
be
willing
to
wager
all
the
profits
of
sidney
cremer
next
play
or
novel
if
i
had
them
that
you
can
now
go
back
if
you
like
and
get
without
any
difficulty
the
heiress
you
came
across
the
water
for
i
sick
of
the
very
word
heiress
protested
loveland
with
complete
sincerity
that
the
new
you
and
what
a
very
new
you
it
is
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
only
a
few
weeks
old
but
it
the
only
real
one
the
other
was
a
shell
which
has
broken
you
broke
it
said
val
i
cracked
it
a
little
maybe
on
the
boat
but
it
took
a
big
hammer
to
smash
it
and
now
i
swept
all
the
fragments
away
there
just
the
real
you
and
the
real
me
in
the
world
with
the
wonderful
light
from
the
other
side
of
the
moon
shining
on
us
two
and
sidney
cremer
oh
sidney
cremer
cried
loveland
he
still
stands
between
us
no
he
does
if
you
love
me
you
have
to
love
sidney
too
because
sidney
cremer
and
i
are
one
and
his
money
is
mine
because
i
earn
it
and
i
enjoy
it
too
have
i
enjoyed
it
for
three
whole
years
since
all
of
a
sudden
from
being
a
poor
girl
dependent
on
aunt
barbara
i
waked
up
to
find
myself
a
rich
one
oh
not
rich
in
your
meaning
of
the
word
not
rich
enough
to
line
castle
walls
with
gold
and
diamonds
but
rich
enough
to
do
nice
little
things
for
an
old
kentucky
and
perhaps
even
to
help
restore
ancient
british
strongholds
if
the
lord
of
them
and
of
my
heart
will
give
me
so
much
happiness
you
you
are
sidney
cremer
loveland
could
only
stammer
the
words
stupidly
yes
are
you
so
surprised
that
i
clever
enough
to
make
a
success
with
my
brain
and
my
pen
i
often
wondered
when
you
begin
to
suspect
but
you
never
did
and
i
was
wondering
too
whether
sidney
cremer
would
have
to
propose
to
you
in
the
end
it
been
great
fun
keeping
my
secret
from
the
world
never
letting
anyone
know
the
real
truth
except
auntie
and
the
ashville
cousins
though
fanny
milton
and
lots
of
other
acquaintances
thought
i
was
a
of
sidney
cremer
perhaps
even
a
poor
relation
of
his
but
the
most
fun
of
all
has
been
keeping
the
secret
from
you
till
the
time
was
ripe
to
tell
do
you
remember
saying
the
other
day
cremer
is
everything
i
told
you
i
remind
you
of
that
some
time
and
ask
if
you
could
say
it
again
can
you
now
sidney
cremer
is
everything
repeated
loveland
whereupon
lesley
gave
one
of
her
little
soft
cooing
sighs
and
let
him
take
her
into
his
arms
they
were
both
very
muddy
and
mossy
and
rather
bruised
and
shaken
if
they
had
not
been
too
deeply
absorbed
in
the
feelings
of
their
hearts
to
think
of
the
feelings
of
their
bodies
and
perhaps
a
boggy
field
with
no
shelter
save
a
lying
rakishly
on
one
side
was
a
queer
place
for
an
engagement
between
a
young
english
marquis
and
a
celebrated
american
but
for
lesley
and
loveland
it
was
perfect
sidney
cremer
vivid
fancy
had
never
created
a
more
enchanting
scene
for
the
of
hero
and
heroine
and
though
if
there
had
been
an
audience
it
would
have
seen
the
stage
lit
up
only
with
pale
rays
of
wintry
sunshine
for
the
girl
and
the
man
it
was
illumined
with
ineffable
light

the
other

the
