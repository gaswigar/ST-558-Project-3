during
the
severe
winter
of
the
river
oise
was
frozen
over
and
the
plains
of
lower
picardy
were
covered
with
deep
snow
on
christmas
day
especially
a
heavy
squall
from
the
had
almost
buried
the
little
city
of
beaumont
the
snow
which
began
to
fall
early
in
the
morning
increased
towards
evening
and
accumulated
during
the
night
in
the
upper
town
in
the
rue
des
orfevres
at
the
end
of
which
as
if
enclosed
therein
is
the
northern
front
of
the
cathedral
transept
this
was
blown
with
great
force
by
the
wind
against
the
portal
of
saint
agnes
the
old
romanesque
portal
where
traces
of
early
gothic
could
be
seen
contrasting
its
florid
ornamentation
with
the
bare
simplicity
of
the
transept
gable
the
inhabitants
still
slept
wearied
by
the
festive
rejoicings
of
the
previous
day
the
struck
six
in
the
darkness
which
was
slightly
lightened
by
the
slow
persistent
fall
of
flakes
a
vague
living
form
alone
was
visible
that
of
a
little
girl
nine
years
of
age
who
having
taken
refuge
under
the
archway
of
the
portal
had
passed
the
night
there
shivering
and
sheltering
herself
as
well
as
possible
she
wore
a
thin
woollen
dress
ragged
from
long
use
her
head
was
covered
with
a
torn
silk
handkerchief
and
on
her
bare
feet
were
heavy
shoes
much
too
large
for
her
without
doubt
she
had
only
gone
there
after
having
well
wandered
through
the
town
for
she
had
fallen
down
from
sheer
exhaustion
for
her
it
was
the
end
of
the
world
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
interest
her
it
was
the
last
surrender
the
hunger
that
gnaws
the
cold
which
kills
and
in
her
weakness
stifled
by
the
heavy
weight
at
her
heart
she
ceased
to
struggle
and
nothing
was
left
to
her
but
the
instinctive
movement
of
preservation
the
desire
of
changing
place
of
sinking
still
deeper
into
these
old
stones
whenever
a
sudden
gust
made
the
snow
whirl
about
her
hour
after
hour
passed
for
a
long
time
between
the
divisions
of
this
double
door
she
leaned
her
back
against
the
abutting
pier
on
whose
column
was
a
statue
of
saint
agnes
the
martyr
of
but
thirteen
years
of
age
a
little
girl
like
herself
who
carried
a
branch
of
palm
and
at
whose
feet
was
a
lamb
and
in
the
tympanum
above
the
lintel
the
whole
legend
of
the
virgin
child
betrothed
to
jesus
could
be
seen
in
high
relief
set
forth
with
a
charming
simplicity
of
faith
her
hair
which
grew
long
and
covered
her
like
a
garment
when
the
governor
whose
son
she
had
refused
to
marry
gave
her
up
to
the
soldiers
the
flames
of
the
funeral
pile
destined
to
destroy
her
turning
aside
and
burning
her
executioners
as
soon
as
they
lighted
the
wood
the
miracles
performed
by
her
relics
constance
daughter
of
the
emperor
cured
of
leprosy
and
the
quaint
story
of
one
of
her
painted
images
which
when
the
priest
paulinus
offered
it
a
very
valuable
emerald
ring
held
out
its
finger
then
withdrew
it
keeping
the
ring
which
can
be
seen
at
this
present
day
at
the
top
of
the
tympanum
in
a
halo
of
glory
agnes
is
at
last
received
into
heaven
where
her
betrothed
jesus
marries
her
so
young
and
so
little
giving
her
the
kiss
of
eternal
happiness
but
when
the
wind
rushed
through
the
street
the
snow
was
blown
in
the
child
s
face
and
the
threshold
was
almost
barred
by
the
white
masses
then
she
moved
away
to
the
side
against
the
virgins
placed
above
the
base
of
the
arch
these
are
the
companions
of
agnes
the
saints
who
served
as
her
escort
three
at
her
right
dorothea
who
was
fed
in
prison
by
miraculous
bread
barbe
who
lived
in
a
tower
and
genevieve
whose
heroism
saved
paris
and
three
at
her
left
agatha
whose
breast
was
torn
christina
who
was
put
to
torture
by
her
father
and
cecilia
beloved
by
the
angels
above
these
were
statues
and
statues
three
close
ranks
mounting
with
the
curves
of
the
arches
decorating
them
with
chaste
triumphant
figures
who
after
the
suffering
and
martyrdom
of
their
earthly
life
were
welcomed
by
a
host
of
winged
cherubim
transported
with
ecstasy
into
the
celestial
kingdom
there
had
been
no
shelter
for
the
little
waif
for
a
long
time
when
at
last
the
clock
struck
eight
and
daylight
came
the
snow
had
she
not
trampled
it
down
would
have
come
up
to
her
shoulders
the
old
door
behind
her
was
covered
with
it
as
if
hung
with
ermine
and
it
looked
as
white
as
an
altar
beneath
the
grey
front
of
the
church
so
bare
and
smooth
that
not
even
a
single
flake
had
clung
to
it
the
great
saints
those
of
the
sloping
surface
especially
were
clothed
in
it
and
were
glistening
in
purity
from
their
feet
to
their
white
beards
still
higher
in
the
scenes
of
the
tympanum
the
outlines
of
the
little
saints
of
the
arches
were
designed
most
clearly
on
a
dark
background
and
this
magic
sect
continued
until
the
final
rapture
at
the
marriage
of
agnes
which
the
archangels
appeared
to
be
celebrating
under
a
shower
of
white
roses
standing
upon
her
pillar
with
her
white
branch
of
palm
and
her
white
lamp
the
virgin
child
had
such
purity
in
the
lines
of
her
body
of
immaculate
snow
that
the
motionless
stiffness
of
cold
seemed
to
congeal
around
her
the
mystic
transports
of
victorious
youth
and
at
her
feet
the
other
child
so
miserable
white
with
snow
she
also
grew
so
stiff
and
pale
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
turning
to
stone
and
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
the
great
images
above
her
at
last
in
one
of
the
long
line
of
houses
in
which
all
seemed
to
be
sleeping
the
noise
from
the
drawing
up
of
a
blind
made
her
raise
her
eyes
it
was
at
her
right
hand
in
the
second
story
of
a
house
at
the
side
of
the
cathedral
a
very
handsome
woman
a
brunette
about
forty
years
of
age
with
a
placid
expression
of
serenity
was
just
looking
out
from
there
and
in
spite
of
the
terrible
frost
she
kept
her
uncovered
arm
in
the
air
for
a
moment
having
seen
the
child
move
her
calm
face
grew
sad
with
pity
and
astonishment
then
shivering
she
hastily
closed
the
window
she
carried
with
her
the
rapid
vision
of
a
fair
little
creature
with
eyes
under
a
of
an
old
silk
handkerchief
the
face
was
oval
the
neck
long
and
slender
as
a
lily
and
the
shoulders
drooping
but
she
was
blue
from
cold
her
little
hands
and
feet
were
half
dead
and
the
only
thing
about
her
that
still
showed
life
was
the
slight
vapour
of
her
breath
the
child
remained
with
her
eyes
upturned
looking
at
the
house
mechanically
it
was
a
narrow
one
two
stories
in
height
very
old
and
evidently
built
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
was
almost
sealed
to
the
side
of
the
cathedral
between
two
buttresses
like
a
wart
which
had
pushed
itself
between
the
two
toes
of
a
colossus
and
thus
supported
on
each
side
it
was
admirably
preserved
with
its
stone
basement
its
second
story
in
wooden
panels
ornamented
with
bricks
its
roof
of
which
the
framework
advanced
at
least
three
feet
beyond
the
gable
its
turret
for
the
projecting
stairway
at
the
left
corner
where
could
still
be
seen
in
the
little
window
the
leaden
setting
of
long
ago
at
times
repairs
had
been
made
on
account
of
its
age
the
dated
from
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
for
one
easily
recognised
the
work
of
that
epoch
a
dormer
window
pierced
in
the
side
of
the
turret
little
wooden
frames
replacing
everywhere
those
of
the
primitive
panes
the
three
united
openings
of
the
second
story
had
been
reduced
to
two
that
of
the
middle
being
closed
up
with
bricks
thus
giving
to
the
front
the
symmetry
of
the
other
buildings
on
the
street
of
a
more
recent
date
in
the
basement
the
changes
were
equally
visible
an
oaken
door
with
mouldings
having
taken
the
place
of
the
old
one
with
iron
trimmings
that
was
under
the
stairway
and
the
great
central
arcade
of
which
the
lower
part
the
sides
and
the
point
had
been
plastered
over
so
as
to
leave
only
one
rectangular
opening
was
now
a
species
of
large
window
instead
of
the
one
which
formerly
came
out
on
to
the
street
without
thinking
the
child
still
looked
at
this
venerable
dwelling
of
a
so
well
preserved
and
as
she
read
upon
a
little
yellow
plate
nailed
at
the
left
of
the
door
these
words
hubert
chasuble
maker
printed
in
black
letters
she
was
again
attracted
by
the
sound
of
the
opening
of
a
shutter
this
time
it
was
the
blind
of
the
square
window
of
the
ground
floor
a
man
in
his
turn
looked
out
his
face
was
full
his
nose
aquiline
his
forehead
projecting
and
his
thick
short
hair
already
white
although
he
was
scarcely
yet
he
too
forgot
the
air
for
a
moment
as
he
examined
her
with
a
sad
wrinkle
on
his
great
tender
mouth
then
she
saw
him
as
he
remained
standing
behind
the
little
panes
he
turned
beckoned
to
someone
and
his
wife
reappeared
how
handsome
she
was
they
both
stood
side
by
side
looking
at
her
earnestly
and
sadly
for
four
hundred
years
the
line
of
huberts
embroiderers
from
father
to
son
had
lived
in
this
house
a
noted
maker
of
chasubles
had
built
it
under
louis
xi
another
had
repaired
it
under
louis
xiv
and
the
hubert
who
now
occupied
it
still
embroidered
church
vestments
as
his
ancestors
had
always
done
at
twenty
years
of
age
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
hubertine
and
so
deep
was
their
affection
for
each
other
that
when
her
mother
widow
of
a
magistrate
refused
to
give
her
consent
to
their
union
they
ran
away
together
and
were
married
she
was
remarkably
beautiful
and
that
was
their
whole
romance
their
joy
and
their
misfortune
when
a
year
later
she
went
to
the
deathbed
of
her
mother
the
latter
disinherited
her
and
gave
her
her
curse
so
affected
was
she
by
the
terrible
scene
that
her
infant
born
soon
after
died
and
since
then
it
seemed
as
if
even
in
her
coffin
in
the
cemetery
the
willful
woman
had
never
pardoned
her
daughter
for
it
was
alas
a
childless
household
after
years
they
still
mourned
the
little
one
they
had
lost
disturbed
by
their
looks
the
stranger
tried
to
hide
herself
behind
the
pillar
of
saint
agnes
she
was
also
annoyed
by
the
movement
which
now
commenced
in
the
street
as
the
shops
were
being
opened
and
people
began
to
go
out
the
rue
des
orfevres
which
terminates
at
the
side
front
of
the
church
would
be
almost
impassable
blocked
in
as
it
is
on
one
side
by
the
house
of
the
huberts
if
the
rue
du
soleil
a
narrow
lane
did
not
relieve
it
on
the
other
side
by
running
the
whole
length
of
the
cathedral
to
the
great
front
on
the
place
du
cloitre
at
this
hour
there
were
few
passers
excepting
one
or
two
persons
who
were
on
their
way
to
early
service
and
they
looked
with
surprise
at
the
poor
little
girl
whom
they
did
not
recognise
as
ever
having
seen
at
beaumont
the
slow
persistent
fall
of
snow
continued
the
cold
seemed
to
increase
with
the
wan
daylight
and
in
the
dull
thickness
of
the
great
white
shroud
which
covered
the
town
one
heard
as
if
from
a
distance
the
sound
of
voices
but
timid
ashamed
of
her
abandonment
as
if
it
were
a
fault
the
child
drew
still
farther
back
when
suddenly
she
recognised
before
her
hubertine
who
having
no
servant
had
gone
out
to
buy
bread
what
are
you
doing
there
little
one
who
are
you
she
did
not
answer
but
hid
her
face
then
she
was
no
longer
conscious
of
suffering
her
whole
being
seemed
to
have
faded
away
as
if
her
heart
turned
to
ice
had
stopped
beating
when
the
good
lady
turned
away
with
a
pitying
look
she
sank
down
upon
her
knees
completely
exhausted
and
slipped
listlessly
into
the
snow
whose
flakes
quickly
covered
her
and
the
woman
as
she
returned
with
her
fresh
rolls
seeing
that
she
had
fallen
again
approached
her
look
up
my
child
you
can
not
remain
here
on
this
then
hubert
who
had
also
come
out
and
was
standing
near
the
threshold
took
the
bread
from
his
wife
and
said
take
her
up
and
bring
her
into
the
hubertine
did
not
reply
but
stooping
lifted
her
in
her
strong
arms
and
the
child
shrank
back
no
longer
but
was
carried
as
if
inanimate
her
teeth
closely
set
her
eyes
shut
chilled
through
and
through
and
with
the
lightness
of
a
little
bird
that
had
just
fallen
from
its
nest
they
went
in
hubert
shut
the
door
while
hubertine
bearing
her
burden
passed
through
the
front
room
which
served
as
a
parlour
and
where
some
embroidered
bands
were
spread
out
for
show
before
the
great
square
window
then
she
went
into
the
kitchen
the
old
servants
hall
preserved
almost
intact
with
its
heavy
beams
its
flagstone
floor
mended
in
a
dozen
places
and
its
great
fireplace
with
its
stone
mantelpiece
on
shelves
were
the
utensils
the
pots
kettles
and
saucepans
that
dated
back
one
or
two
centuries
and
the
dishes
were
of
old
stone
or
earthenware
and
of
pewter
but
on
the
middle
of
the
hearth
was
a
modern
a
large
one
whose
copper
trimmings
were
wondrously
bright
it
was
red
from
heat
and
the
water
was
bubbling
away
in
its
boiler
a
large
porringer
filled
with
was
on
one
corner
of
it
oh
how
much
more
comfortable
it
is
here
than
outside
said
hubert
as
he
put
the
bread
down
on
a
heavy
table
of
the
style
of
louis
xiii
which
was
in
the
centre
of
the
room
now
seat
this
poor
little
creature
near
the
stove
that
she
may
be
thawed
out
hubertine
had
already
placed
the
child
close
to
the
fire
and
they
both
looked
at
her
as
she
slowly
regained
consciousness
as
the
snow
that
covered
her
clothes
melted
it
fell
in
heavy
drops
through
the
holes
of
her
great
shoes
they
could
see
her
little
bruised
feet
whilst
the
thin
woollen
dress
designed
the
rigidity
of
her
limbs
and
her
poor
body
worn
by
misery
and
pain
she
had
a
long
attack
of
nervous
trembling
and
then
opened
her
frightened
eyes
with
the
start
of
an
animal
which
suddenly
awakes
from
sleep
to
find
itself
caught
in
a
snare
her
face
seemed
to
sink
away
under
the
silken
rag
which
was
tied
under
her
chin
her
right
arm
appeared
to
be
helpless
for
she
pressed
it
so
closely
to
her
breast
do
not
be
alarmed
for
we
will
not
hurt
you
where
did
you
come
from
who
are
you
but
the
more
she
was
spoken
to
the
more
frightened
she
became
turning
her
head
as
if
someone
were
behind
her
who
would
beat
her
she
examined
the
kitchen
furtively
the
flaggings
the
beams
and
the
shining
utensils
then
her
glance
passed
through
the
irregular
windows
which
were
left
in
the
ancient
opening
and
she
saw
the
garden
clear
to
the
trees
by
the
bishop
s
house
whose
white
shadows
towered
above
the
wall
at
the
end
while
at
the
left
as
if
astonished
at
finding
itself
there
stretched
along
the
whole
length
of
the
alley
the
cathedral
with
its
romanesque
windows
in
the
chapels
of
its
apses
and
again
from
the
heat
of
the
stove
which
began
to
penetrate
her
she
had
a
long
attack
of
shivering
after
which
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
floor
and
remained
quiet
do
you
belong
to
beaumont
who
is
your
father
she
was
so
entirely
silent
that
hubert
thought
her
throat
must
be
too
dry
to
allow
her
to
speak
instead
of
questioning
her
he
said
we
would
do
much
better
to
give
her
a
cup
of
coffee
as
hot
as
she
can
drink
that
was
so
reasonable
that
hubertine
immediately
handed
her
the
cup
she
herself
held
whilst
she
cut
two
large
slices
of
bread
and
buttered
them
the
child
still
mistrustful
continued
to
shrink
back
but
her
hunger
was
too
great
and
soon
she
ate
and
drank
ravenously
that
there
need
not
be
a
restraint
upon
her
the
husband
and
wife
were
silent
and
were
touched
to
tears
on
seeing
her
little
hand
tremble
to
such
a
degree
that
at
times
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
reach
her
mouth
she
made
use
only
of
her
left
hand
for
her
right
arm
seemed
to
be
fastened
to
her
chest
when
she
had
finished
she
almost
broke
the
cup
which
she
caught
again
by
an
awkward
movement
of
her
elbow
have
you
hurt
your
arm
badly
hubertine
asked
do
not
be
afraid
my
dear
but
show
it
to
but
as
she
was
about
to
touch
it
the
child
rose
up
hastily
trying
to
prevent
her
and
as
in
the
struggle
she
moved
her
arm
a
little
book
which
she
had
hidden
under
her
dress
slipped
through
a
large
tear
in
her
waist
she
tried
to
take
it
and
when
she
saw
her
unknown
hosts
open
and
begin
to
read
it
she
clenched
her
fist
in
anger
it
was
an
official
certificate
given
by
the
administration
des
enfants
assistes
in
the
department
of
the
seine
on
the
first
page
under
a
medallion
containing
a
likeness
of
saint
vincent
de
paul
were
the
printed
prescribed
forms
for
the
family
name
a
simple
black
line
filled
the
allotted
space
then
for
the
christian
names
were
those
of
angelique
marie
for
the
dates
born
january
admitted
the
of
the
same
month
under
the
registered
number
of
so
there
was
neither
father
nor
mother
there
were
no
papers
not
even
a
statement
of
where
she
was
born
nothing
but
this
little
book
of
official
coldness
with
its
cover
of
pale
red
pasteboard
no
relative
in
the
world
and
even
her
abandonment
numbered
and
classed
oh
then
she
is
a
foundling
exclaimed
hubertine
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
the
child
replied
i
am
much
better
than
all
the
others
yes
yes
i
am
better
better
better
i
have
never
taken
anything
that
did
not
belong
to
me
and
yet
they
stole
all
i
had
give
me
back
now
that
which
you
also
have
stolen
from
me
such
powerless
passion
such
pride
to
be
above
the
others
in
goodness
so
shook
the
body
of
the
little
girl
that
the
huberts
were
startled
they
no
longer
recognised
the
blonde
creature
with
violet
eyes
and
graceful
figure
now
her
eyes
were
black
her
face
dark
and
her
neck
seemed
swollen
by
a
rush
of
blood
to
it
since
she
had
become
warm
she
raised
her
head
and
hissed
like
a
serpent
that
had
been
picked
up
on
the
snow
are
you
then
really
so
naughty
asked
hubert
gently
if
we
wish
to
know
all
about
you
it
is
because
we
wish
to
help
and
looking
over
the
shoulders
of
his
wife
he
read
as
the
latter
turned
the
leaves
of
the
little
book
on
the
second
page
was
the
name
of
the
nurse
the
child
angelique
marie
had
been
given
on
january
to
the
nurse
francoise
sister
of
hamelin
a
farmer
by
profession
living
in
the
parish
of
soulanges
an
arrondissement
of
nevers
the
aforesaid
nurse
had
received
on
her
departure
the
pay
for
the
first
month
of
her
care
in
addition
to
her
then
there
was
a
certificate
of
her
baptism
signed
by
the
chaplain
of
the
asylum
for
abandoned
children
also
that
of
the
physician
on
the
arrival
and
on
the
departure
of
the
infant
the
monthly
accounts
paid
in
quarterly
installments
filled
farther
on
the
columns
of
four
pages
and
each
time
there
was
the
illegible
signature
of
the
receiver
or
collector
what
nevers
asked
hubertine
you
were
brought
up
near
nevers
angelique
red
with
anger
that
she
could
not
prevent
them
from
reading
had
fallen
into
a
sullen
silence
but
at
last
she
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
of
her
nurse
ah
you
may
be
sure
that
maman
nini
would
have
beaten
you
she
always
took
my
part
against
others
she
did
although
sometimes
she
struck
me
herself
ah
it
is
true
i
was
not
so
unhappy
over
there
with
the
cattle
and
all
her
voice
choked
her
and
she
continued
in
broken
incoherent
sentences
to
speak
of
the
meadow
where
she
drove
the
great
red
cow
of
the
broad
road
where
she
played
of
the
cakes
they
cooked
and
of
a
pet
that
had
once
bitten
her
hubert
interrupted
her
as
he
read
aloud
in
case
of
illness
or
of
bad
treatment
the
superintendent
is
authorised
to
change
the
nurses
of
the
below
it
was
written
that
the
child
angelique
marie
had
been
given
on
june
to
the
care
of
theresa
wife
of
louis
franchomme
both
of
them
makers
of
artificial
flowers
in
paris
ah
i
understand
said
hubertine
you
were
ill
and
so
they
took
you
back
to
but
no
that
was
not
the
case
and
the
huberts
did
not
know
the
whole
history
until
they
had
drawn
it
little
by
little
from
angelique
louis
franchomme
who
was
a
cousin
of
maman
nini
went
to
pass
a
month
in
his
native
village
when
recovering
from
a
fever
it
was
then
that
his
wife
theresa
became
very
fond
of
the
child
and
obtained
permission
to
take
her
to
paris
where
she
could
be
taught
the
trade
of
making
flowers
three
months
later
her
husband
died
and
she
herself
being
delicate
in
health
was
obliged
to
leave
the
city
and
to
go
to
her
brother
s
the
tanner
rabier
who
was
settled
at
beaumont
she
alas
died
in
the
early
days
of
december
and
confided
to
her
the
little
girl
who
since
that
time
had
been
injured
beaten
and
in
short
suffered
martyrdom
the
rabiers
said
hubert
the
rabiers
yes
yes
they
are
tanners
on
the
banks
of
the
ligneul
in
the
lower
town
the
husband
is
lame
and
the
wife
is
a
noted
they
treated
me
as
if
i
came
from
the
gutter
continued
angelique
revolted
and
enraged
in
her
mortified
pride
they
said
the
river
was
the
best
place
for
me
after
she
had
beaten
me
nearly
to
death
the
woman
would
put
something
on
the
floor
for
me
to
eat
as
if
i
were
a
cat
and
many
a
time
i
went
to
bed
suffering
from
hunger
oh
i
could
have
killed
myself
at
last
she
made
a
gesture
of
furious
despair
yesterday
christmas
morning
they
had
been
drinking
and
to
amuse
themselves
they
threatened
to
put
out
my
eyes
then
after
a
while
they
began
to
fight
with
each
other
and
dealt
such
heavy
blows
that
i
thought
they
were
dead
as
they
both
fell
on
the
floor
of
their
room
for
a
long
time
i
had
determined
to
run
away
but
i
was
anxious
to
have
my
book
maman
nini
had
often
said
in
showing
it
to
me
look
this
is
all
that
you
own
and
if
you
do
not
keep
this
you
will
not
even
have
a
and
i
know
that
since
the
death
of
maman
theresa
they
had
hid
it
in
one
of
the
bureau
drawers
so
stepping
over
them
as
quietly
as
possible
while
they
were
lying
on
the
floor
i
got
the
book
hid
it
under
my
pressing
it
against
me
with
my
arm
it
seemed
so
large
that
i
fancied
everyone
must
see
it
and
that
it
would
be
taken
from
me
oh
i
ran
and
ran
and
ran
and
when
night
came
it
was
so
dark
oh
how
cold
i
was
under
the
poor
shelter
of
that
great
door
oh
dear
i
was
so
cold
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
dead
but
never
mind
now
for
i
did
not
once
let
go
of
my
book
and
here
it
and
with
a
sudden
movement
as
the
huberts
closed
it
to
give
it
back
to
her
she
snatched
it
from
them
then
sitting
down
she
put
her
head
on
the
table
sobbing
deeply
as
she
laid
her
cheek
on
the
light
red
cover
her
pride
seemed
conquered
by
an
intense
humility
her
whole
being
appeared
to
be
softened
by
the
sight
of
these
few
leaves
with
their
rumpled
corners
her
solitary
possession
her
one
treasure
and
the
only
tie
which
connected
her
with
the
life
of
this
world
she
could
not
relieve
her
heart
of
her
great
despair
her
tears
flowed
continually
and
under
this
complete
surrender
of
herself
she
regained
her
delicate
looks
and
became
again
a
pretty
child
her
slightly
oval
face
was
pure
in
its
outlines
her
violet
eyes
were
made
a
little
paler
from
emotion
and
the
curve
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
made
her
resemble
a
little
virgin
on
a
church
window
at
length
she
seized
the
hand
of
hubertine
pressed
it
to
her
lips
most
caressingly
and
kissed
it
passionately
the
huberts
were
deeply
touched
and
could
scarcely
speak
they
stammered
dear
dear
child
she
was
not
then
in
reality
bad
perhaps
with
affectionate
care
she
could
be
corrected
of
this
violence
of
temper
which
had
so
alarmed
them
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
the
poor
child
exclaimed
do
not
send
me
back
to
those
dreadful
people
oh
do
not
send
me
back
again
the
husband
and
wife
looked
at
each
other
for
a
few
moments
in
fact
since
the
autumn
they
had
planned
taking
as
an
apprentice
some
young
girl
who
would
live
with
them
and
thus
bring
a
little
brightness
into
their
house
which
seemed
so
dull
without
children
and
their
decision
was
soon
made
would
you
like
it
my
dear
hubert
asked
hubertine
replied
quietly
in
her
calm
voice
i
would
immediately
they
occupied
themselves
with
the
necessary
formalities
the
husband
went
to
the
justice
of
peace
of
the
northern
district
of
beaumont
who
was
cousin
to
his
wife
the
only
relative
with
whom
she
had
kept
up
an
acquaintance
and
told
him
all
the
facts
of
the
case
he
took
charge
of
it
wrote
to
the
hospice
of
abandoned
children
where
thanks
to
the
registered
number
angelique
was
easily
recognised
and
obtained
permission
for
her
to
remain
as
apprentice
with
the
huberts
who
were
well
known
for
their
honourable
position
the
of
the
hospice
on
coming
to
verify
the
little
book
signed
the
new
contract
as
witness
for
hubert
by
which
the
latter
promised
to
treat
the
child
kindly
to
keep
her
tidy
to
send
her
to
school
and
to
church
and
to
give
her
a
good
bed
to
herself
on
the
other
side
the
administration
agreed
to
pay
him
all
indemnities
and
to
give
the
child
certain
stipulated
articles
of
clothing
as
was
their
custom
in
ten
days
all
was
arranged
angelique
slept
upstairs
in
a
room
under
the
roof
by
the
side
of
the
garret
and
the
windows
of
which
overlooked
the
garden
she
had
already
taken
her
first
lessons
in
embroidery
the
first
sunday
morning
after
she
was
in
her
new
home
before
going
to
mass
hubertine
opened
before
her
the
old
chest
in
the
where
she
kept
the
fine
gold
thread
she
held
up
the
little
book
then
placing
it
in
that
back
part
of
one
of
the
drawers
said
look
i
have
put
it
here
i
will
not
hide
it
but
leave
it
where
you
can
take
it
if
you
ever
wish
to
do
so
it
is
best
that
you
should
see
it
and
remember
where
it
on
entering
the
church
that
day
angelique
found
herself
again
under
the
doorway
of
saint
agnes
during
the
week
there
had
been
a
partial
thaw
then
the
cold
weather
had
returned
to
so
intense
a
degree
that
the
snow
which
had
half
melted
on
the
statues
had
congealed
itself
in
large
bunches
or
in
icicles
now
the
figures
seemed
dressed
in
transparent
robes
of
ice
with
lace
trimmings
like
spun
glass
dorothea
was
holding
a
torch
the
liquid
droppings
of
which
fell
upon
her
hands
cecilia
wore
a
silver
crown
in
which
glistened
the
most
brilliant
of
pearls
agatha
s
nude
chest
was
protected
by
a
crystal
armour
and
the
scenes
in
the
tympanum
the
little
virgins
in
the
arches
looked
as
if
they
had
been
there
for
centuries
behind
the
glass
and
jewels
of
the
shrine
of
a
saint
agnes
herself
let
trail
behind
her
her
court
mantle
threaded
with
light
and
embroidered
with
stars
her
lamb
had
a
fleece
of
diamonds
and
her
had
become
the
colour
of
heaven
the
whole
door
was
resplendent
in
the
purity
of
intense
cold
angelique
recollected
the
night
she
had
passed
there
under
the
protection
of
these
saints
she
raised
her
head
and
smiled

beaumont
is
composed
of
two
villages
completely
separated
and
quite
distinct
one
from
the
other
eglise
on
the
hill
with
its
old
cathedral
of
the
twelfth
century
its
bishop
s
palace
which
dates
only
from
the
seventeenth
century
its
inhabitants
scarcely
one
thousand
in
number
who
are
crowded
together
in
an
almost
stifling
way
in
its
narrow
streets
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
banks
of
the
ligneul
an
ancient
suburb
which
the
success
of
its
manufactories
of
lace
and
fine
cambric
has
enriched
and
enlarged
to
such
an
extent
that
it
has
a
population
of
nearly
ten
thousand
persons
several
public
squares
and
an
elegant
built
in
the
modern
style
these
two
divisions
the
northern
district
and
the
southern
district
have
thus
no
longer
anything
in
common

in
an
administrative
way
although
scarcely
thirty
leagues
from

where
one

to
be
still
immured
in
its
old
ramparts

however
only
three

class
of
people
lead
there
a
life
similar
to
that
which
their
ancestors
had
led
from
father
to
son
during
the
past
five
hundred
years
the

explains
everything
has
given
birth
to
and
preserved
everything
it
is
the
mother
the
queen
as
it
rises
in
all
its
majesty
in
the
centre
of
and
above
the
little
collection
of
low
houses
which
like
shivering
birds
are
sheltered

her
wings
of

there
simply
for
it
and
only
by
it
there
is
no
movement
of
business
activity
and

little
tradesmen
only
sell
the
necessities
of
life
such
as
are
absolutely
required
to
feed
to
clothe
and
to
maintain
the
church
and
its
clergy
and
if
occasionally
one
meets
some
private
individuals
they
are
merely
the
last
representatives
of
a
scattered
crowd
of
worshippers
the

dominates
all
each

one
of

veins
the

has
no
other
breath
than
its
own
on
that
account
this
spirit
of
another
age
this
religious
torpor
from
the
past
makes
the
cloistered
city
which
surrounds
it
redolent
with
a
savoury
perfume
of
peace
and
of
faith
and
in
all
this
mystic
place
the
house
of
the
huberts
where
angelique
was
to
live
in
the
future
was
the
one
nearest
to
the
cathedral
and
which
clung
to
it
as
if
in
reality
it
were
a
part
thereof
the
permission
to
build
there
between
two
of
the
great
buttresses
must
have
been
given
by
some
vicar
long
ago
who
was
desirous
of
attaching
to
himself
the
ancestors
of
this
line
of
embroiderers
as
master
and
furnishers
for
the
cathedral
clergy
on
the
southern
side
the
narrow
garden
was
barred
by
the
colossal
building

the
circumference
of
the
side
chapels
whose
windows
overlooked
the
and
then
the
slender
long
nave
that
the
flying
buttresses
supported
and
afterwards
the
high
roof
covered
with
the
sheet
lead
the
sun
never
penetrated
to
the
lower
part
of
this
garden
where
ivy
and
box
alone
grew
luxuriantly
yet
the
eternal
shadow
there
was
very
soft
and
pleasant
as
it
fell
from
the
gigantic
brow
of
the
apse
a
religious
shadow
sepulchral
and
pure
which
had
a
good
odour
about
it
in
the
greenish
of
its
calm
freshness
the
two
towers
let
fall
only
the
sound
of
their
chimes
but
the
entire
house
kept
the
quivering
therefrom
sealed
as
it
was
to
these
old
stones
melted
into
them
and
supported
by
them
it
trembled
at
the
least
of
the
ceremonies
at
the
high
mass
the
rumbling
of
the
organ
the
voices
of
the
choristers
even
the
oppressed
sighs
of
the
worshippers
murmured
through
each
one
of
its
rooms
lulled
it
as
if
with
a
holy
breath
from
the
invisible
and
at
times
through
the
walls
seemed
to
come
the
vapours
from
the
burning
incense
for
five
years
angelique
lived
and
grew
there
as
if
in
a
cloister
far
away
from
the
world
she
only
went
out
to
attend
the
clock
mass
on
sunday
mornings
as
hubertine
had
obtained
permission
for
her
to
study
at
home
fearing
that
if
sent
to
school
she
might
not
always
have
the
best
of
associates
this
old
dwelling
so
shut
in
with
its
garden
of
a
dead
quiet
was
her
world
she
occupied
as
her
chamber
a
little
whitewashed
room
under
the
roof
she
went
down
in
the
morning
to
her
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
she
went
up
again
to
the
in
the
second
story
to
her
embroidery
and
these
places
with
the
turning
stone
stairway
of
the
turret
were
the
only
corners
in
which
she
passed
her
time
for
she
never
went
into
the
huberts
apartments
and
only
crossed
the
parlour
on
the
first
floor
and
they
were
the
two
rooms
which
had
been
rejuvenated
and
modernised
in
the
parlour
the
beams
were
plastered
over
and
the
ceiling
had
been
decorated
with
a
cornice
accompanied
by
a
rose
centre
the
dated
from
the
first
empire
as
well
as
the
white
marble
and
the
mahogany
furniture
which
consisted
of
a
sofa
and
four
armchairs
covered
with
utrecht
velvet
a
centre
table
and
a
cabinet
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
went
there
to
add
to
the
articles
exposed
for
sale
some
new
bands
of
embroidery
if
she
cast
her
eyes
without
she
saw
through
the
window
the
same
unchanging
vista
the
narrow
street
ending
at
the
portal
of
saint
agnes
a
parishioner
pushing
open
the
little
lower
door
which
shut
itself
without
any
noise
and
the
shops
of
the
and
opposite
which
appeared
to
be
always
empty
but
where
was
a
display
of
holy
sacramental
vessels
and
long
lines
of
great
church
tapers
and
the
cloistral
calm
of
all
eglise
of
the
rue
magloire
back
of
the
bishop
s
palace
of
the
grande
rue
where
the
rue
de
orfevres
began
and
of
the
place
du
cloitre
where
rose
up
the
two
towers
was
felt
in
the
drowsy
air
and
seemed
to
fall
gently
with
the
pale
daylight
on
the
deserted
pavement
hubertine
had
taken
upon
herself
the
charge
of
the
education
of
angelique
moreover
she
was
very
in
her
ideas
and
maintained
that
a
woman
knew
enough
if
she
could
read
well
write
correctly
and
had
studied
thoroughly
the
first
four
rules
of
arithmetic
but
even
for
this
limited
instruction
she
had
constantly
to
contend
with
an
unwillingness
on
the
part
of
her
pupil
who
instead
of
giving
her
attention
to
her
books
preferred
looking
out
of
the
windows
although
the
recreation
was
very
limited
as
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
garden
from
them
in
reality
angelique
cared
only
for
reading
notwithstanding
in
her
dictations
chosen
from
some
classic
writer
she
never
succeeded
in
spelling
a
page
correctly
yet
her
handwriting
was
exceedingly
pretty
graceful
and
bold
one
of
those
irregular
styles
which
were
quite
the
fashion
long
ago
as
for
other
studies
of
geography
and
history
and
cyphering
she
was
almost
completely
ignorant
of
them
what
good
would
knowledge
ever
do
her
it
was
really
useless
she
thought
later
on
when
it
was
time
for
her
to
be
confirmed
she
learned
her
catechism
word
for
word
and
with
so
fervent
an
ardour
that
she
astonished
everyone
by
the
exactitude
of
her
memory
notwithstanding
their
gentleness
during
the
first
year
the
huberts
were
often
discouraged
angelique
who
promised
to
be
skilful
in
embroidering
disconcerted
them
by
sudden
changes
to
inexplicable
idleness
after
days
of
praiseworthy
application
she
was
capricious
seemed
to
lose
her
strength
became
greedy
would
steal
sugar
to
eat
when
alone
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
looked
wearied
under
their
reddened
lids
if
reproved
she
would
reply
with
a
flood
of
injurious
words
some
days
when
they
wished
to
try
to
subdue
her
her
foolish
pride
at
being
interfered
with
would
throw
her
into
such
serious
attacks
that
she
would
strike
her
feet
and
her
hands
together
and
seemed
ready
to
tear
her
clothing
or
to
bite
anyone
who
approached
her
at
such
moments
they
drew
away
from
her
for
she
was
like
a
little
monster
ruled
by
the
evil
sprit
within
her
who
could
she
be
where
did
she
come
from
almost
always
these
abandoned
children
are
the
offspring
of
vice
twice
they
had
resolved
to
give
her
up
and
send
her
back
to
the
asylum
so
discouraged
were
they
and
so
deeply
did
they
regret
having
taken
her
but
each
time
these
frightful
scenes
which
almost
made
the
house
tremble
ended
in
the
same
deluge
of
tears
and
the
same
excited
expressions
and
acts
of
penitence
when
the
child
would
throw
herself
on
the
floor
begging
them
so
earnestly
to
punish
her
that
they
were
obliged
to
forgive
her
little
by
little
hubertine
gained
great
authority
over
her
she
was
peculiarly
adapted
for
such
a
task
with
her
kind
heart
her
gentle
firmness
her
and
her
uniform
temper
she
taught
her
the
duty
of
obedience
and
the
sin
of
pride
and
of
passion
to
obey
was
to
live
we
must
obey
god
our
parents
and
our
superiors
there
was
a
whole
hierarchy
of
respect
outside
of
which
existence
was
unrestrained
and
disorderly
so
after
each
fit
of
passion
that
she
might
learn
humility
some
menial
labour
was
imposed
upon
her
as
a
penance
such
as
washing
the
or
wiping
up
the
kitchen
floor
and
until
it
was
finished
she
would
remain
stooping
over
her
work
enraged
at
first
but
conquered
at
last
with
the
little
girl
excess
seemed
to
be
a
marked
characteristic
in
everything
even
in
her
caresses
many
times
hubertine
had
seen
her
kissing
her
hands
with
vehemence
she
would
often
be
in
a
fever
of
ecstasy
before
the
little
pictures
of
saints
and
of
the
child
jesus
which
she
had
collected
and
one
evening
she
was
found
in
a
state
with
her
head
upon
the
table
and
her
lips
pressed
to
those
of
the
images
when
hubertine
confiscated
them
there
was
a
terrible
scene
of
tears
and
cries
as
if
she
herself
were
being
tortured
after
that
she
was
held
very
strictly
was
made
to
obey
and
her
freaks
were
at
once
checked
by
keeping
her
busy
at
her
work
as
soon
as
her
cheeks
grew
very
red
her
eyes
dark
and
she
had
nervous
tremblings
everything
was
immediately
made
quiet
about
her
moreover
hubertine
had
found
an
unexpected
aid
in
the
book
given
by
the
society
for
the
protection
of
abandoned
children
every
three
months
when
the
collector
signed
it
angelique
was
very
for
the
rest
of
the
day
if
by
chance
she
saw
it
when
she
went
to
the
drawer
for
a
ball
of
gold
thread
her
heart
seemed
pierced
with
agony
and
one
day
when
in
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
fury
which
nothing
had
been
able
to
conquer
she
turned
over
the
contents
of
the
drawer
she
suddenly
appeared
as
if
thunderstruck
before
the
book
her
sobs
stifled
her
she
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
huberts
in
great
humility
stammering
that
they
had
made
a
mistake
in
giving
her
shelter
and
that
she
was
not
worthy
of
all
their
kindness
from
that
time
her
anger
was
frequently
restrained
by
the
sight
or
the
mention
of
the
book
in
this
way
angelique
lived
until
she
was
twelve
years
of
age
and
ready
to
be
confirmed
the
calm
life
of
the
household
the
little
building
sleeping
under
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
perfumed
with
incense
and
penetrated
with
religious
music
favoured
the
slow
amelioration
of
this
untutored
nature
this
wild
flower
taken
from
no
one
knew
where
and
transplanted
in
the
mystic
soil
of
the
narrow
garden
added
to
this
was
the
regularity
of
her
daily
work
and
the
utter
ignorance
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
without
even
an
echo
from
a
sleepy
quarter
penetrating
therein
but
above
all
the
gentlest
influence
came
from
the
great
love
of
the
huberts
for
each
other
which
seemed
to
be
enlarged
by
some
unknown
incurable
remorse
he
passed
the
days
in
endeavouring
to
make
his
wife
forget
the
injury
he
had
done
her
in
marrying
her
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
her
mother
he
had
realised
at
the
death
of
their
child
that
she
half
accused
him
of
this
punishment
and
he
wished
to
be
forgiven
she
had
done
so
years
ago
and
now
she
idolised
him
sometimes
he
was
not
sure
of
it
and
this
doubt
saddened
his
life
he
wished
they
might
have
had
another
infant
and
so
feel
assured
that
the
obstinate
mother
had
been
softened
after
death
and
had
withdrawn
her
malediction
that
in
fact
was
their
united
desire
a
child
of
pardon
and
he
worshipped
his
wife
with
a
tender
love
ardent
and
pure
as
that
of
a
betrothed
if
before
the
apprentice
he
did
not
even
kiss
her
hand
he
never
entered
their
chamber
even
after
twenty
years
of
marriage
without
an
emotion
of
gratitude
for
all
the
happiness
that
had
been
given
him
this
was
their
true
home
this
room
with
its
tinted
paintings
its
blue
its
pretty
hangings
and
its
walnut
furniture
never
was
an
angry
word
uttered
therein
and
as
if
from
a
sanctuary
a
sentiment
of
tenderness
went
out
from
its
occupants
and
filled
the
house
it
was
thus
for
angelique
an
atmosphere
of
affection
and
love
in
which
she
grew
and
thrived
an
unexpected
event
finished
the
work
of
forming
her
character
as
she
was
rummaging
one
morning
in
a
corner
of
the
she
found
on
a
shelf
among
implements
of
embroidery
which
were
no
longer
used
a
very
old
copy
of
the
golden
legend
by
jacques
de
voragine
this
french
translation
dating
from
must
have
been
bought
in
the
long
ago
by
some
in
church
vestments
on
account
of
the
pictures
full
of
useful
information
upon
the
saints
it
was
a
great
while
since
angelique
had
given
any
attention
to
the
little
old
carved
images
showing
such
childlike
faith
which
had
once
delighted
her
but
now
as
soon
as
she
was
allowed
to
go
out
and
play
in
the
garden
she
took
the
book
with
her
it
had
been
rebound
in
yellow
calf
and
was
in
a
good
condition
she
slowly
turned
over
some
of
the
leaves
then
looked
at
the
in
red
and
black
with
the
address
of
the
bookseller
a
paris
en
la
rue

a
l
enseigne
saint

baptiste
and
decorated
with
medallions
of
the
four
evangelists
framed
at
the
bottom
by
the
adoration
of
the
three
magi
and
at
the
top
by
the
triumph
of
jesus
christ
and
his
resurrection
and
then
picture
after
picture
followed
there
were
ornamented
letters
large
and
small
engravings
in
the
text
and
at
the
heading
of
the
chapters
the
annunciation
an
immense
angel
inundating
with
rays
of
light
a
slight
mary
the
massacre
of

where
a
cruel

of

carrying
the

and
others
and
still
others
followed
there
was
an
increasing
terror
and
a
piety
in
each
one
of
them
making
it
a
history
which
weighs
upon
the
heart
and
fills
the
eyes
with
tears
but
little
by
little
angelique
was
curious
to
know
exactly
what
these
engravings
represented
the
two
columns
of
text
the
impression
of
which
remained
very
black
upon
the
papers
yellowed
by
time
frightened
her
by
the
strange
almost
barbaric
look
of
the
gothic
letters
still
she
accustomed
herself
to
it
deciphered
these
characters
learned
the
abbreviations
and
the
contractions
and
soon
knew
how
to
explain
the
turning
of
the
phrases
and
the
words
at
last
she
could
read
it
easily
and
was
as
enchanted
as
if
she
were
penetrating
a
mystery
and
she
triumphed
over
each
new
difficulty
that
she
conquered
under
these
laborious
shades
a
whole
world
of
light
revealed
itself
she
entered
as
it
were
into
a
celestial
splendour
for
now
the
few
classic
books
they
owned
so
cold
and
dry
existed
no
longer
the
legend
alone
interested
her
she
bent
over
it
with
her
forehead
resting
on
her
hands
studying
it
so
intently
that
she
no
longer
lived
in
the
real
life
but
unconscious
of
time
she
seemed
to
see
mounting
from
the
depths
of
the
unknown
the
broad
expansion
of
a
dream
how
wonderful
it
all
was

extraordinary

those

then
opposite
the

behold
the
evil
spirits
they
often
fly
about
us
like
insects
and
fill
the
air
without
number
the
air
is
also
full
of
demons
as
the
rays
of
the
sun
are
full
of
atoms
it
is
even
like
and
the
eternal
contest
begins
the
saints
are
always
victorious
and
yet
they
are
constantly
obliged
to
renew
the
battle
the

by
the
voice
of
the
person
possessed
whose
body
they
shook
as
if
by
a
tempest
at
each
corner
of
the
highways
an
afflicted
one
is
seen
and
the
first
saint
who
passes
contends
with
the
evil
spirits
they
enter
by
the
eyes
the
ears
and
by
the
mouth
and
after
days
of
fearful
struggling
they
go
out
with
loud
groanings
basilus
to
save
a
young
man
contends
personally
with
the
evil
one
macarius
was
attacked
when
in
a
cemetery
and
passed
a
whole
night
in
defending
himself
the
angels
even
at
deathbeds
in
order
to
secure
the
soul
of
the
dying
were
obliged
to
beat
the
demons
at
other
times
the
contests
are
only
of
the
intellect
and
the
mind
but
are
equally
remarkable
satan
who
prowls
about
assumes
many
forms
sometimes
disguising
himself
as
a
woman
and
again
even
as
a
saint
but
once
overthrown
he
appears
in
all
his
ugliness
a
black
cat
larger
than
a
dog
his
huge
eyes
emitting
flame
his
tongue
long
large
and
bloody
his
tail
twisted
and
raised
in
the
air
and
his
whole
body
disgusting
to
the
last
he
is
the
one
thing
that
is
hated
and
the
only
preoccupation
people
fear
him
yet
ridicule
him
one
is
not
even
honest
with
him
in
reality
notwithstanding
the
ferocious
appearance
of
his
furnaces
he
is
the
eternal
dupe
all
the
treaties
he
makes
are
forced
from
him
by
violence
or
cunning
feeble
women
throw
him
down
margaret
crushes
his
head
with
her
feet
and
juliana
beats
him
with
her
chain
from
all
this
a
serenity
disengages
itself
a
disdain
of
evil
since
it
is
powerless
and
a
certainty
of
good
since
virtue
triumphs
it
is
only
necessary
to
cross
one
s
self
and
the
devil
can
do
no
harm
but
yells
and
disappears
while
the
infernal
regions
tremble
then
in
this
combat
of
legions
of
saints
against
satan
are
developed
the
fearful
sufferings
from
persecutions
the
executioners
expose
to
the
flies
the
martyrs
whose
bodies
are
covered
with
honey
they
make
them
walk
with
bare
feet
over
broken
glass
or
coals
put
them
in
ditches
with
reptiles
chastise
them
with
whips
whose
thongs
are
weighted
with
leaden
balls
nail
them
when
alive
in
coffins
which
they
throw
into
the
sea
hang
them
by
their
hair
and
then
set
fire
to
them
moisten
their
wounds
with
quicklime
boiling
pitch
or
molten
lead
make
them
sit
on
iron
stools
burn
their
sides
with
torches
break
their
bones
on
wheels
and
torture
them
in
every
conceivable
way
and
with
all
this
physical
pain
counts
for
nothing
indeed
it
seems
to
be
desired
moreover
a
continual
miracle
protects
them

yet
he
still
lives
and
his
pains
are
changed
into
a
sweetness
of
flowers
a
great
light
fills
his
dungeon
and
angels
sing
with
him
giving
him
rest
as
if
he
were
on
a
bed
of
roses
the
sweet
sound
of
singing
and
the
fresh
odour
of
flowers
spread
without

the
room
and
when
the
guards
saw
the
miracle
they
were
converted
to
the
faith
and
when
dacian
heard
of
it
he
was
greatly
enraged
and
said
do
nothing
more
to
him
for
we
are
such
was
the
excitement
among
the
persecutors
it
could
only
end
either
by
their
conversion
or
by
their
death
their
hands
are
paralysed
they
perish
violently
they
are

by

taught

suffered
martyrdom
when

three
years
of
age
reproved
the

the

for
celestial
happiness
deadened
the
physical
senses
and
softened

were
they
torn
to
pieces

minded
it
not
they
never
yielded
and
they
called
for

more
quickly

prayer
is
granted
and
a
white
dove
flies
from

mouth
and
bears
her
soul
to

angelique
marvelled
greatly
at
all
these
accounts
so
many
abominations
and
such
triumphant
joy
delighted
her
and
carried
her
out
of
herself
but
other
points
in
the
legend
of
quite
a
different
nature
also
interested
her
the
animals
for
instance
of
which
there
were
enough
to
fill
an
ark
of
noah
she
liked
the
ravens
and
the
eagles
who
fed
the
hermits
then
what
lovely
stories
there
were
about
the
lions
the
serviceable
one
who
found
a
in
a
field
for
mary
the
egyptian
the
flaming
lion
who
protected
virgins
or
maidens
in
danger
and
then
the
lion
of
saint
jerome
to
whose
care
an
ass
had
been
confided
and
when
the
animal
was
stolen
went
in
search
of
him
and
brought
him
back
there
was
also
the
penitent
wolf
who
had
restored
a
little
pig
he
had
intended
eating
then
there
was
bernard
who
excommunicates
the
flies
and
they
drop
dead
remi
and
blaise
feed
birds
at
their
table
bless
them
and
make
them
strong
francis
filled
with
a
simplicity
preaches
to
them
and
exhorts
them
to
love
god
a
bird
was
on
a
branch
of
a
and
francis
holding
out
his
hand
beckoned
to
it
and
soon
it
obeyed
and
lighted
on
his
hand
and
he
said
to
it
sing
my
sister
and
praise
the
and
immediately
the
bird
began
to
sing
and
did
not
go
away
until
it
was
told
to
do
so
all
this
was
a
continual
source
of
recreation
to
angelique
and
gave
her
the
idea
of
calling
to
the
swallows
and
hoping
they
might
come
to
her
the
good
giant
christopher
who
carried
the
infant
christ
on
his
shoulders
delighted
her
so
much
as
to
bring
tears
to
her
eyes
she
was
very
merry
over
the
misadventures
of
a
certain
governor
with
the
three
chambermaids
of
anastasia
whom
he
hoped
to
have
found
in
the
kitchen
where
he
kissed
the
stove
and
the
kettles
thinking
he
was
embracing
them
he
went
out
therefrom
very
black
and
ugly
and
his
clothes
quite
smutched
and
when
his
servants
who
were
waiting
saw
him
in
such
a
state
they
thought
he
was
the
devil
then
they
beat
him
with
and
running
away
left
him
but
that
which
convulsed
her
most
with
laughter
was
the
account
of
the
blows
given
to
the
evil
one
himself
especially
when
juliana
having
been
tempted
by
him
in
her
prison
cell
administered
such
an
extraordinary
chastisement
with
her
chain
then
the
provost
commanded
that
juliana
should
be
brought
before
him
and
when
she
came
into
his
presence
she
was
drawing
the
devil
after
her
and
he
cried
out
saying
my
good
lady
juliana
do
not
hurt
me
any
more
she
led
him
in
this
way
around
the
public
square
and
afterwards
threw
him
into
a
deep
often
angelique
would
repeat
to
the
huberts
as
they
were
all
at
work
together
legends
far
more
interesting
than
any
she
had
read
them
over
so
often
that
she
knew
them
by
heart
and
she
told
in
a
charming
way
the
story
of
the
seven
sleepers
who
to
escape
persecution
walled
themselves
up
in
a
cavern
and
whose
awakening
greatly
astonished
the
emperor
theodosius
then
the
legend
of
saint
clement
with
its
endless
adventures
so
unexpected
and
touching
where
the
whole
family
father
mother
and
three
sons
separated
by
terrible
misfortunes
are
finally
in
the
midst
of
the
most
beautiful
miracles
her
tears
would
flow
at
these
recitals
she
dreamed
of
them
at
night
she
lived
as
it
were
only
in
this
tragic
and
triumphant
world
of
prodigy
in
a
supernatural
country
where
all
virtues
are
recompensed
by
all
imaginable
joys
when
angelique
partook
of
her
first
communion
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
walking
like
the
saints
a
little
above
the
earth
she
was
a
young
christian
of
the
primitive
church
she
gave
herself
into
the
hands
of
god
having
learned
from
her
book
that
she
could
not
be
saved
without
grace
the
huberts
were
simple
in
their
profession
of
faith
they
went
every
sunday
to
mass
and
to
communion
on
all
great
and
this
was
done
with
the
tranquil
humility
of
true
belief
aided
a
little
by
tradition
as
the
chasubliers
had
from
father
to
son
always
observed
the
church
ceremonies
particularly
those
at
easter
hubert
himself
had
a
tendency
to
imaginative
fancies
he
would
at
times
stop
his
work
and
let
fall
his
frame
to
listen
to
the
child
as
she
read
or
repeated
the
legends
and
carried
away
for
the
moment
by
her
enthusiasm
it
seemed
as
if
his
hair
were
blown
about
by
the
light
breath
of
some
invisible
power
he
was
so
in
sympathy
with
angelique
and
associated
her
to
such
a
degree
with
the
youthful
saints
of
the
past
that
he
wept
when
he
saw
her
in
her
white
dress
and
veil
this
day
at
church
was
like
a
dream
and
they
returned
home
quite
exhausted
hubertine
was
obliged
to
scold
them
both
for
with
her
excellent
she
disliked
exaggeration
even
in
good
things
from
that
time
she
had
to
restrain
the
zeal
of
angelique
especially
in
her
tendency
to
what
she
thought
was
charity
and
to
which
she
wished
to
devote
herself

confirmation

were
those
whose
experiences
touched
her
to
the
heart
and
helped
her
to
correct
her
failings
thus
the
learned
catherine
of
high
birth
enchanted
her
by
her
great
scientific
knowledge
when
only
eighteen
years
of
age
she
was
called
by
the
emperor
maximus
to
discuss
certain
questions
with
fifty
rhetoricians
and
grammarians
she
astonished
and
convinced
them
they
were
amazed
and
knew
not
what
to
say
but
they
remained
quiet
and
the
emperor
blamed
them
for
their
weakness
in
allowing
themselves
to
be
so
easily
conquered
by
a
young
the
fifty
professors
then
declared
that
they
were
converted
and
as
soon
as
the
tyrant
heard
that
he
had
so
terrible
a
fit
of
anger
that
he
commanded
they
should
all
be
burned
to
death
in
the
public
in
her
eyes
catherine
was
the
invincible
learned
woman
as
proud
and
dazzling
in
intellect
as
in
beauty
just
as
she
would
have
liked
to
be
that
she
might
convert
men
and
be
fed
in
prison
by
a
dove
before
having
her
head
cut
off
but
saint
elizabeth
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
hungary
was
for
her
a
constant
teacher
and
guide
whenever
she
was
inclined
to
yield
to
her
violent
temper
she
thought
of
this
model
of
gentleness
and
simplicity
who
was
at
five
years
of
age
very
devout
refusing
to
join
her
playmates
in
their
sports
and
sleeping
on
the
ground
that
in
abasing
herself
she
might
all
the
better
render
homage
to
god
later
she
was
the
faithful
obedient
wife
of
the
landgrave
of
thuringia
always
showing
to
her
husband
a
smiling
face
although
she
passed
her
nights
in
tears
when
she
became
a
widow
she
was
driven
from
her
estates
but
was
happy
to
lead
the
life
of
poverty
her
dress
was
so
thin
from
use
that
she
wore
a
grey
mantle
lengthened
out
by
cloth
of
a
different
shade
the
sleeves
of
her
jacket
had
been
torn
and
were
mended
with
a
material
of
another
colour
the
king
her
father
wishing
her
to
come
to
him
sent
for
her
by
a
count
and
when
the
count
saw
her
clothed
in
such
a
way
and
spinning
overcome
with
surprise
and
grief
he
exclaimed
never
before
did
one
see
the
daughter
of
a
royal
house
in
so
miserable
a
garb
and
never
was
one
known
to
spin
wool
until
so
christian
and
sincere
was
her
humility
that
she
ate
black
bread
with
the
poorest
peasants
nursed
them
when
ill
dressed
their
sores
without
repugnance
put
on
coarse
garments
like
theirs
and
followed
them
in
the
church
processions
with
bare
feet
she
was
once
washing
the
porringers
and
the
utensils
of
the
kitchen
when
the
maids
seeing
her
so
out
of
place
urged
her
to
desist
but
she
replied
could
i
find
another
task
more
menial
even
than
this
i
would
do
influenced
by
her
example
angelique
who
was
formerly
angry
when
obliged
to
do
any
cleaning
in
the
kitchen
now
tried
to
invent
some
extremely
disagreeable
task
when
she
felt
nervous
and
in
need
of
control
but
more
than
catherine
more
than
elizabeth
far
nearer
and
dearer
to
her
than
all
the
other
saints
was
agnes
the
and
her
heart
leaped
with
joy
on
refinding
in
the
golden
legend
this
virgin
clothed
with
her
own
hair
who
had
protected
her
under
the
cathedral
portal
what
ardour
of
pure
love
as
she
repelled
the
son
of
the
governor
when
he
accosted
her
on
her
way
from
school
go
leave
me
minister
of
death
commencement
of
sin
and
child
of
treason
how
exquisitely
she
described
her
beloved
i
love
the
one
whose
mother
was
a
virgin
and
whose
father
was
faithful
to
her
at
whose
beauty
the
sun
and
moon
marvelled
and
at
whose
touch
the
dead
were
made
and
when
aspasien
commanded
that
her
throat
should
be
cut
by
the
sword
she
ascended
into
paradise
to
be
united
to
her
betrothed
whiter
and
purer
than
always
when
weary
or
disturbed
angelique
called
upon
and
implored
her
and
it
seemed
as
if
peace
came
to
her
at
once
she
saw
her
constantly
near
her
and
often
she
regretted
having
done
or
thought
of
things
which
would
have
displeased
her
one
evening
as
she
was
kissing
her
hands
a
habit
which
she
still
at
times
indulged
in
she
suddenly
blushed
and
turned
away
although
she
was
quite
alone
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
little
saint
must
have
seen
her
agnes
was
her
guardian
angel
thus
at
fifteen
angelique
was
an
adorable
child
certainly
neither
the
quiet
laborious
life
nor
the
soothing
shadows
of
the
cathedral
nor
the
legends
of
the
beautiful
saints
had
made
her
an
angel
a
creature
of
absolute
perfection
she
was
often
angry
and
certain
weaknesses
of
character
showed
themselves
which
had
never
been
sufficiently
guarded
against
but
she
was
always
ashamed
and
penitent
if
she
had
done
wrong
for
she
wished
so
much
to
be
perfect
and
she
was
so
human
so
full
of
life
so
ignorant
and
withal
so
pure
in
reality
one
day
on
returning
from
a
long
excursion
which
the
huberts
allowed
her
to
take
twice
a
year
on
pentecost
monday
and
on
assumption
day
she
took
home
with
her
a
sweetbriar
bush
and
then
amused
herself
by
replanting
it
in
the
narrow
garden
she
trimmed
it
and
watered
it
well
it
grew
and
sent
out
long
branches
filled
with
odour
with
her
usual
intensity
she
watched
it
daily
but
was
unwilling
to
have
it
grafted
as
she
wished
to
see
if
by
some
miracle
it
could
not
be
made
to
bear
roses
she
danced
around
it
she
repeated
constantly
this
bush
is
like
me
it
is
like
me
and
if
one
joked
her
upon
her
great
bush
she
joined
them
in
their
laughter
although
a
little
pale
and
with
tears
almost
ready
to
fall
her
eyes
were
softer
than
ever
her
lips
revealed
little
white
teeth
and
her
oval
face
had
a
golden
aureole
from
her
light
wavy
hair
she
had
grown
tall
without
being
too
slight
her
neck
and
shoulders
were
exquisitely
graceful
her
chest
was
full
her
waist
flexible
and
gay
healthy
of
a
rare
beauty
she
had
an
infinite
charm
arising
from
the
innocence
and
purity
of
her
soul
every
day
the
affection
of
the
huberts
for
her
increased
they
often
talked
together
of
their
mutual
wish
to
adopt
her
yet
they
took
no
active
measures
in
that
way
lest
they
might
have
cause
to
regret
it
one
morning
when
the
husband
announced
his
final
decision
his
wife
suddenly
began
to
weep
bitterly
to
adopt
a
child
was
not
that
the
same
as
giving
up
all
hope
of
having
one
of
their
own
yet
it
was
useless
for
them
to
expect
one
now
after
so
many
years
of
waiting
and
she
gave
her
consent
in
reality
delighted
that
she
could
call
her
her
daughter
when
angelique
was
spoken
to
on
the
subject
she
threw
her
arms
around
their
necks
kissed
them
both
and
was
almost
choked
with
tears
of
joy
so
it
was
agreed
upon
that
she
was
always
to
remain
with
them
in
this
house
which
now
seemed
to
be
filled
with
her
presence
rejuvenated
by
her
youth
and
penetrated
by
her
laughter
but
an
unexpected
obstacle
was
met
with
at
the
first
step
the
justice
of
the
peace
monsieur
grandsire
on
being
consulted
explained
to
them
the
radical
impossibility
of
adoption
since
by
law
the
adopted
must
be
of
then
seeing
their
disappointment
he
suggested
the
expedient
of
a
legal
guardianship
any
individual
over
fifty
years
of
age
can
attach
himself
to
a
minor
of
fifteen
years
or
less
by
a
legal
claim
on
becoming
their
official
protector
the
ages
were
all
right
so
they
were
delighted
and
accepted
it
was
even
arranged
that
they
should
afterwards
confer
the
title
of
adoption
upon
their
ward
by
way
of
their
united
last
will
and
testament
as
such
a
thing
would
be
permitted
by
the
code
monsieur
grandsire
furnished
with
the
demand
of
the
husband
and
the
authorisation
of
the
wife
then
put
himself
in
communication
with
the
director
of
public
aid
the
general
guardian
for
all
abandoned
children
whose
consent
it
was
necessary
to
have
great
inquiries
were
made
and
at
last
the
necessary
papers
were
placed
in
paris
with
a
certain
justice
of
the
peace
chosen
for
the
purpose
and
all
was
ready
except
the
official
report
which
constitutes
the
legality
of
guardianship
when
the
huberts
suddenly
were
taken
with
certain
scruples
before
receiving
angelique
into
their
family
ought
not
they
to
ascertain
if
she
had
any
relatives
on
her
side
was
her
mother
still
alive
had
they
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
daughter
without
being
absolutely
sure
that
she
had
willingly
been
given
up
and
deserted
then
in
reality
the
unknown
origin
of
the
child
which
had
troubled
them
long
ago
came
back
to
them
now
and
made
them
hesitate
they
were
so
tormented
by
this
anxiety
that
they
could
not
sleep
without
any
more
talk
hubert
unexpectedly
announced
that
he
was
going
to
paris
such
a
journey
seemed
like
a
catastrophe
in
his
calm
existence
he
explained
the
necessity
of
it
to
angelique
by
speaking
of
the
guardianship
he
hoped
to
arrange
everything
in
hours
but
once
in
the
city
days
passed
obstacles
arose
on
every
side
he
spent
a
week
there
sent
from
one
to
another
really
doing
nothing
and
quite
discouraged
in
the
first
place
he
was
received
very
coldly
at
the
office
of
public
assistance
the
rule
of
the
administration
is
that
children
shall
not
be
told
of
their
parents
until
they
are
of
age
so
for
two
mornings
in
succession
he
was
sent
away
from
the
office
he
persisted
however
explained
the
matter
to
three
secretaries
made
himself
hoarse
in
talking
to
an
who
wished
to
counsel
him
that
he
had
not
official
papers
the
administration
were
quite
ignorant
a
nurse
had
left
the
child
there
angelique
marie
without
naming
the
mother
in
despair
he
was
about
to
return
to
beaumont
when
a
new
idea
impelled
him
to
return
for
the
fourth
time
to
the
office
to
see
the
book
in
which
the
arrival
of
the
infant
had
been
noted
down
and
in
that
way
to
have
the
address
of
the
nurse
that
proved
quite
an
undertaking
but
at
last
he
succeeded
and
found
it
was
a
madame
foucart
and
that
in
she
lived
on
the
rue
des
then
he
recommenced
his
hunting
up
and
down
the
end
of
the
rue
des
had
been
demolished
and
no
shopkeeper
in
the
neighbourhood
recollected
ever
having
heard
of
madame
foucart
he
consulted
the
directory
but
there
was
no
such
name
looking
at
every
sign
as
he
walked
along
he
called
on
one
after
another
and
at
last
in
this
way
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
an
old
woman
who
exclaimed
in
answer
to
his
questions
what
do
i
know
madame
foucart
a
most
honourable
person
but
one
who
has
had
many
misfortunes
she
lives
on
the
rue
de
censier
quite
at
the
other
end
of
he
hastened
there
at
once
warned
by
experience
he
determined
now
to
be
diplomatic
but
madame
foucart
an
enormous
woman
would
not
allow
him
to
ask
questions
in
the
good
order
he
had
arranged
them
before
going
there
as
soon
as
he
mentioned
the
two
names
of
the
child
she
seemed
to
be
eager
to
talk
and
she
related
its
whole
history
in
a
most
spiteful
way
ah
the
child
was
alive
very
well
she
might
flatter
herself
that
she
had
for
a
mother
a
most
famous
hussy
yes
madame
sidonie
as
she
was
called
since
she
became
a
widow
was
a
woman
of
a
good
family
having
it
is
said
a
brother
who
was
a
minister
but
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
being
very
and
she
explained
that
she
had
made
her
acquaintance
when
she
kept
on
the
rue
a
little
shop
where
they
dealt
in
fruit
and
oil
from
provence
she
and
her
husband
when
they
came
from
plassans
hoping
to
make
their
fortune
in
the
city
the
husband
died
and
was
buried
and
soon
after
madame
sidonie
had
a
little
daughter
which
she
sent
at
once
to
the
hospital
and
never
after
even
inquired
for
her
as
she
was
a
heartless
woman
cold
as
a
protest
and
brutal
as
a
sheriff
s
a
fault
can
be
pardoned
but
not
ingratitude
was
not
it
true
that
obliged
to
leave
her
shop
as
she
was
so
heavily
in
debt
she
had
been
received
and
cared
for
by
madame
foucart
and
when
in
her
turn
she
herself
had
fallen
into
difficulties
she
had
never
been
able
to
obtain
from
madame
sidonie
even
the
month
s
board
she
owed
her
nor
the
fifteen
francs
she
had
once
lent
her
the
hateful
thing
lived
on
the
rue
de
where
she
had
a
little
apartment
of
three
rooms
she
pretended
to
be
a
cleaner
and
mender
of
lace
but
she
sold
a
good
many
other
things
ah
yes
such
a
mother
as
that
it
was
best
to
know
nothing
about
an
hour
later
hubert
was
walking
round
the
house
where
madame
sidonie
lived
he
saw
through
the
window
a
woman
thin
pale
wearing
an
old
black
gown
stained
and
greased
never
could
the
heart
of
such
a
person
be
touched
by
the
recollection
of
a
daughter
whom
she
had
only
seen
on
the
day
of
its
birth
he
concluded
it
would
be
best
not
to
repeat
even
to
his
wife
many
things
that
he
had
just
learned
still
he
hesitated
once
more
he
passed
by
the
place
and
looked
again
ought
not
he
to
go
in
to
introduce
himself
and
to
ask
the
consent
of
the
unnatural
parent
as
an
honest
man
it
was
for
him
to
judge
if
he
had
the
right
of
cutting
the
tie
there
and
for
ever
brusquely
he
turned
his
back
hurried
away
and
returned
that
evening
to
beaumont
hubertine
had
just
learned
that
the
at
monsieur
grandsire
s
for
the
guardianship
of
the
child
had
been
signed
and
when
angelique
threw
herself
into
hubert
s
arms
he
saw
clearly
by
the
look
of
supplication
in
her
eyes
that
she
had
understood
the
true
reason
of
his
journey
then
he
said
quietly
my
child
your
mother
is
not
angelique
wept
as
she
kissed
him
most
affectionately
after
this
the
subject
was
not
referred
to
she
was
their
daughter
at
whitsuntide
this
year
the
huberts
had
taken
angelique
with
them
to
lunch
at
the
ruins
of
the
chateau
d
hautecoeur
which
overlooks
the
ligneul
two
leagues
below
beaumont
and
after
the
day
spent
in
running
and
laughing
in
the
open
air
the
young
girl
still
slept
when
the
next
morning
the
old
struck
eight
hubertine
was
obliged
to
go
up
and
rap
at
her
door
ah
well
little
lazy
child
we
have
already
had
our
breakfast
and
it
is
angelique
dressed
herself
quickly
and
went
down
to
the
kitchen
where
she
took
her
rolls
and
coffee
alone
then
when
she
entered
the
workroom
where
hubert
and
his
wife
had
just
seated
themselves
after
having
arranged
their
frames
for
embroidery
she
said
oh
how
soundly
i
did
sleep
i
had
quite
forgotten
that
we
had
promised
to
finish
this
chasuble
for
next
this
workroom
the
windows
of
which
opened
upon
the
garden
was
a
large
apartment
preserved
almost
entirely
in
its
original
state
the
two
principal
beams
of
the
ceiling
and
the
three
visible
of
support
had
not
even
been
whitewashed
and
they
were
blackened
by
smoke
and
while
through
the
openings
of
the
broken
plaster
here
and
there
the
laths
of
the
inner
joists
could
be
seen
on
one
of
the
stone
corbels
which
supported
the
beams
was
the
date
without
doubt
the
date
of
the
construction
of
the
building
the
also
in
stone
broken
and
disjointed
had
traces
of
its
original
elegance
with
its
slender
uprights
its
brackets
its
frieze
with
a
cornice
and
its
funnel
terminating
in
a
crown
on
the
frieze
could
be
seen
even
now
as
if
softened
by
age
an
ingenious
attempt
at
sculpture
in
the
way
of
a
likeness
of
saint
clair
the
patron
of
embroiderers
but
this
chimney
was
no
longer
used
and
the
fireplace
had
been
turned
into
an
open
closet
by
putting
shelves
therein
on
which
were
piles
of
designs
and
patterns
the
room
was
now
heated
by
a
great
stove
the
pipe
of
which
after
going
the
whole
length
of
the
ceiling
entered
an
opening
made
expressly
for
it
in
the
wall
the
doors
already
shaky
were
of
the
time
of
louis
xiv
the
original
tiles
of
the
floor
were
nearly
all
gone
and
had
been
replaced
one
by
one
by
those
of
a
later
style
it
was
nearly
a
hundred
years
since
the
yellow
walls
had
been
coloured
and
at
the
top
of
the
room
they
were
almost
of
a
greyish
white
and
lower
down
were
scratched
and
spotted
with
saltpetre
each
year
there
was
talk
of
repainting
them
but
nothing
had
yet
been
done
from
a
dislike
of
making
any
change
hubertine
busy
at
her
work
raised
her
head
as
angelique
spoke
and
said
you
know
that
if
our
work
is
done
on
sunday
i
have
promised
to
give
you
a
basket
of
pansies
for
your
the
young
girl
exclaimed
gaily
oh
yes
that
is
true
ah
well
i
will
do
my
best
then
but
where
is
my
thimble
it
seems
as
if
all
working
implements
take
to
themselves
wings
and
fly
away
if
not
in
constant
she
flipped
the
old
of
ivory
on
the
second
joint
of
her
little
finger
and
took
her
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
frame
opposite
to
the
window
since
the
middle
of
the
last
century
there
had
not
been
the
slightest
modification
in
the
fittings
and
arrangements
of
the
workroom
fashions
changed
the
art
of
the
embroiderer
was
transformed
but
there
was
still
seen
fastened
to
the
wall
the
chantlate
the
great
piece
of
wood
where
was
placed
one
end
of
the
frame
or
work
while
the
other
end
was
supported
by
a
moving
trestle
in
the
corners
were
many
ancient
tools
a
little
machine
called
a
diligent
with
its
wheels
and
its
long
pins
to
wind
the
gold
thread
on
the
reels
without
touching
it
a
hand
a
species
of
pulley
to
twist
the
threads
which
were
attached
to
the
wall
rollers
of
various
sizes
covered
with
silks
and
threads
used
in
the
crochet
embroidery
upon
a
shelf
was
spread
out
an
old
collection
of
punches
for
the
spangles
and
there
was
also
to
be
seen
a
valuable
relic
in
the
shape
of
the
classic
chandelier
in
hammered
brass
which
belonged
to
some
ancient
on
the
rings
of
a
rack
made
of
a
nailed
leather
strap
were
hung
awls
mallets
hammers
irons
to
cut
the
vellum
and
roughing
chisels
of
bogwood
which
were
used
to
smooth
the
threads
as
fast
as
they
were
employed
and
yet
again
at
the
foot
of
the
heavy
oaken
table
on
which
the
was
done
was
a
great
winder
whose
two
movable
reels
of
wicker
held
the
skeins
long
chains
of
spools
of
silks
strung
on
cords
were
hung
near
that
case
of
drawers
on
the
floor
was
a
large
basket
filled
with
empty
bobbins
a
pair
of
great
shears
rested
on
the
straw
seat
of
one
of
the
chairs
and
a
ball
of
cord
had
just
fallen
on
the
floor
half
unwound
oh
what
lovely
weather
what
perfect
weather
continued
angelique
it
is
a
pleasure
simply
to
live
and
to
and
before
stooping
to
apply
herself
to
her
work
she
delayed
another
moment
before
the
open
window
through
which
entered
all
the
beauty
of
a
radiant
may
morning
chapter
iv
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
a
fresh
odour
of
lilacs
came
up
from
the
bushes
in
the
garden
of
the
bishop
angelique
smiled
as
she
stood
there
dazzled
and
as
if
bathed
in
the
springtide
then
starting
as
if
suddenly
awakened
from
sleep
she
said
father
i
have
no
more
gold
thread
for
my
hubert
who
had
just
finished
pricking
the
tracing
of
the
pattern
of
a
cope
went
to
get
a
skein
from
the
case
of
drawers
cut
it
tapered
off
the
two
ends
by
scratching
the
gold
which
covered
the
silk
and
he
brought
it
to
her
rolled
up
in
parchment
is
that
all
you
need
yes
with
a
quick
glance
she
had
assured
herself
that
nothing
more
was
wanting
the
needles
were
supplied
with
the
different
golds
the
red
the
green
and
the
blue
there
were
spools
of
every
shade
of
silk
the
spangles
were
ready
and
the
twisted
wires
for
the
gold
lace
were
in
the
crown
of
a
hat
which
served
as
a
box
with
the
long
fine
needles
the
steel
pincers
the
thimbles
the
scissors
and
the
ball
of
wax
all
these
were
on
the
frame
even
or
on
the
material
stretched
therein
which
was
protected
by
a
thick
brown
paper
she
had
threaded
a
needle
with
the
gold
thread
but
at
the
first
stitch
it
broke
and
she
was
obliged
to
thread
it
again
breaking
off
tiny
bits
of
the
gold
which
she
threw
immediately
into
the
pasteboard
which
was
near
her
now
at
last
i
am
ready
she
said
as
she
finished
her
first
stitch
perfect
silence
followed
hubert
was
preparing
to
stretch
some
material
on
another
frame
he
had
placed
the
two
heavy
ends
on
the
chantlate
and
the
trestle
directly
opposite
in
such
a
way
as
to
take
lengthwise
the
red
silk
of
the
cope
the
breadths
of
which
hubertine
had
just
stitched
together
and
fitting
the
laths
into
the
mortice
of
the
beams
he
fastened
them
with
four
little
nails
then
after
smoothing
the
material
many
times
from
right
to
left
he
finished
stretching
it
and
tacked
on
the
nails
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
thoroughly
tight
and
firm
he
tapped
on
the
cloth
with
his
fingers
and
it
sounded
like
a
drum
angelique
had
become
a
most
skilful
worker
and
the
huberts
were
astonished
at
her
cleverness
and
taste
in
addition
to
what
they
had
taught
her
she
carried
into
all
she
did
her
personal
enthusiasm
which
gave
life
to
flowers
and
faith
to
symbols
under
her
hands
silk
and
gold
seemed
animated
the
smaller
ornaments
were
full
of
mystic
meaning
she
gave
herself
up
to
it
entirely
with
her
imagination
constantly
active
and
her
firm
belief
in
the
infinitude
of
the
invisible
world
the
diocese
of
beaumont
had
been
so
charmed
with
certain
pieces
of
her
embroidery
that
a
clergyman
who
was
an
archaeologist
and
another
who
was
an
admirer
of
pictures
had
come
to
see
her
and
were
in
raptures
before
her
virgins
which
they
compared
to
the
simple
gracious
figures
of
the
earliest
masters
there
was
the
same
sincerity
the
same
sentiment
of
the
beyond
as
if
encircled
in
the
minutest
perfection
of
detail
she
had
the
real
gift
of
design
a
miraculous
one
indeed
which
without
a
teacher
with
nothing
but
her
evening
studies
by
lamplight
enabled
her
often
to
correct
her
models
to
deviate
entirely
from
them
and
to
follow
her
own
fancies
creating
beautiful
things
with
the
point
of
her
needle
so
the
huberts
who
had
always
insisted
that
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
science
of
drawing
was
necessary
to
make
a
good
embroiderer
were
obliged
to
yield
before
her
notwithstanding
their
long
experience
and
little
by
little
they
modestly
withdrew
into
the
background
becoming
simply
her
aids
surrendering
to
her
all
the
most
elaborate
work
the
under
part
of
which
they
prepared
for
her
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
what
brilliant
and
sacred
marvels
passed
through
her
hands
she
was
always
occupied
with
silks
satins
velvets
or
cloths
of
gold
or
silver
she
embroidered
chasubles
stoles
maniples
copes
dalmatics
mitres
banners
and
veils
for
the
chalice
and
the
pyx
but
above
all
their
orders
for
chasubles
never
failed
and
they
worked
constantly
at
those
vestments
with
their
five
colours
the
white
for
confessors
and
virgins
the
red
for
apostles
and
martyrs
the
black
for
the
days
of
fasting
and
for
the
dead
the
violet
for
the
innocents
and
the
green
for
gold
was
also
often
used
in
place
of
white
or
of
green
the
same
symbols
were
always
in
the
centre
of
the
cross
the
monograms
of
jesus
and
of
the
virgin
mary
the
triangle
surrounded
with
rays
the
lamb
the
pelican
the
dove
a
chalice
a
monstrance
and
a
bleeding
heart
pierced
with
thorns
while
higher
up
and
on
the
arms
were
designs
or
flowers
all
the
ornamentation
being
in
the
ancient
style
and
all
the
flora
in
large
blossoms
like
anemones
tulips
peonies
pomegranates
or
hortensias
no
season
passed
in
which
she
did
not
remake
the
grapes
and
thorns
symbolic
putting
silver
on
black
and
gold
on
red
for
the
most
costly
vestments
she
varied
the
pictures
of
the
heads
of
saints
having
as
a
central
design
the
annunciation
the
last
supper
or
the
crucifixion
sometimes
the
orfreys
were
worked
on
the
original
material
itself
at
others
she
applied
bands
of
silk
or
satin
on
brocades
of
gold
cloth
or
of
velvet
and
all
this
efflorescence
of
sacred
splendour
was
created
little
by
little
by
her
deft
fingers
at
this
moment
the
vestment
on
which
angelique
was
at
work
was
a
chasuble
of
white
satin
the
cross
of
which
was
made
by
a
sheaf
of
golden
lilies
intertwined
with
bright
roses
in
various
shades
of
silk
in
the
centre
in
a
wreath
of
little
roses
of
dead
gold
was
the
monogram
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
red
and
green
gold
with
a
great
variety
of
ornaments
for
an
hour
during
which
she
skilfully
finished
the
little
roses
the
silence
had
not
been
broken
even
by
a
single
word
but
her
thread
broke
again
and
she
her
needle
by
feeling
carefully
under
the
frame
as
only
an
adroit
person
can
do
then
as
she
raised
her
head
she
again
inhaled
with
satisfaction
the
pure
fresh
air
that
came
in
from
the
garden
ah
she
said
softly
how
beautiful
it
was
yesterday
the
sunshine
is
always
hubertine
shook
her
head
as
she
stopped
to
wax
her
thread
as
for
me
i
am
so
wearied
it
seems
as
if
i
had
no
arms
and
it
tires
me
to
work
but
that
is
not
strange
for
i
so
seldom
go
out
and
am
no
longer
young
and
strong
as
you
are
at
angelique
had
reseated
herself
and
resumed
her
work
she
prepared
the
lilies
by
sewing
bits
of
vellum
on
certain
places
that
had
been
marked
so
as
to
give
them
relief
but
the
flowers
themselves
were
not
to
be
made
until
later
for
fear
the
gold
be
tarnished
were
the
hands
moved
much
over
it
hubert
who
having
finished
arranging
the
material
in
its
frame
was
about
drawing
with
pumice
the
pattern
of
the
cope
joined
in
the
conversation
and
said
these
first
warm
days
of
spring
are
sure
to
give
me
a
terrible
angelique
s
eyes
seemed
to
be
vaguely
lost
in
the
rays
which
now
fell
upon
one
of
the
flying
buttresses
of
the
church
as
she
dreamily
added
oh
no
father
i
do
not
think
so
one
day
in
the
lively
air
like
yesterday
does
me
a
world
of
having
finished
the
little
golden
leaves
she
began
one
of
the
large
roses
near
the
lilies
already
she
had
threaded
several
needles
with
the
silks
required
and
she
embroidered
in
stitches
varying
in
length
according
to
the
natural
position
and
movement
of
the
petals
and
notwithstanding
the
extreme
delicacy
and
absorbing
nature
of
this
work
the
recollections
of
the
previous
day
which
she
lived
over
again
in
thought
and
in
silence
now
came
to
her
lips
and
crowded
so
closely
upon
each
other
that
she
no
longer
tried
to
keep
them
back
so
she
talked
of
their
setting
out
upon
their
expedition
of
the
beautiful
fields
they
crossed
of
their
lunch
over
there
in
the
ruins
of
hautecoeur
upon
the
flagstones
of
a
little
room
whose
walls
towered
far
above
the
ligneul
which
rolled
gently
among
the
willows
fifty
yards
below
them
she
was
enthusiastic
over
these
crumbling
ruins
and
the
scattered
blocks
of
stone
among
the
brambles
which
showed
how
enormous
the
colossal
structure
must
have
been
as
when
first
built
it
commanded
the
two
valleys
the
donjon
remained
nearly
two
hundred
feet
in
height
discoloured
cracked
but
nevertheless
firm
upon
its
foundation
pillars
fifteen
feet
thick
two
of
its
towers
had
also
resisted
the
attacks
of
time
that
of
charlemagne
and
that
of
david
united
by
a
heavy
wall
almost
intact
in
the
interior
the
chapel
the
and
certain
chambers
were
still
easily
recognised
and
all
this
appeared
to
have
been
built
by
giants
for
the
steps
of
the
stairways
the
sills
of
the
windows
and
the
branches
on
the
terraces
were
all
on
a
scale
far
out
of
proportion
for
the
generation
of
it
was
in
fact
quite
a
little
fortified
city
five
hundred
men
could
have
sustained
there
a
siege
of
thirty
months
without
suffering
from
want
of
ammunition
or
of
provisions
for
two
centuries
the
bricks
of
the
lowest
story
had
been
disjointed
by
the
wild
roses
lilacs
and
laburnums
covered
with
blossoms
the
rubbish
of
the
fallen
ceilings
a
had
even
grown
up
in
the
fireplace
of
the
guardroom
but
when
at
sunset
the
outline
of
the
donjon
cast
its
long
shadow
over
three
leagues
of
cultivated
ground
and
the
colossal
chateau
seemed
to
be
rebuilt
in
the
evening
mists
one
still
felt
the
great
strength
and
the
old
sovereignty
which
had
made
of
it
so
impregnable
a
fortress
that
even
the
kings
of
france
trembled
before
it
and
i
am
sure
continued
angelique
that
it
is
inhabited
by
the
souls
of
the
dead
who
return
at
night
all
kinds
of
noises
are
heard
there
in
every
direction
are
monsters
who
look
at
you
and
when
i
turned
round
as
we
were
coming
away
i
saw
great
white
figures
fluttering
above
the
wall
but
mother
you
know
all
the
history
of
the
castle
do
you
not
hubertine
replied
as
she
smiled
in
an
amused
way
oh
as
for
ghosts
i
have
never
seen
any
of
them
but
in
reality
she
remembered
perfectly
the
history
which
she
had
read
long
ago
and
to
satisfy
the
eager
questionings
of
the
young
girl
she
was
obliged
to
relate
it
over
again
the
land
belonged
to
the
bishopric
of
rheims
since
the
days
of
saint
remi
who
had
received
it
from
clovis
an
archbishop
severin
in
the
early
years
of
the
tenth
century
had
erected
at
hautecoeur
a
fortress
to
defend
the
country
against
the
normans
who
were
coming
up
the
river
oise
into
which
the
ligneul
flows
in
the
following
century
a
successor
of
severin
gave
it
in
fief
to
norbert
a
younger
son
of
the
house
of
normandy
in
consideration
of
an
annual
of
sixty
sous
and
on
the
condition
that
the
city
of
beaumont
and
its
church
should
remain
free
and
unincumbered
it
was
in
this
way
that
norbert
i
became
the
head
of
the
marquesses
of
hautecoeur
whose
famous
line
from
that
date
became
so
well
known
in
history
herve
iv
excommunicated
twice
for
his
robbery
of
ecclesiastical
property
became
a
noted
highwayman
who
killed
on
a
certain
occasion
with
his
own
hands
thirty
citizens
and
his
tower
was
razed
to
the
ground
by
louis
le
gros
against
whom
he
had
dared
to
declare
war
raoul
i
who
went
to
the
crusades
with
philip
augustus
perished
before
saint
jean
d
acre
having
been
pierced
through
the
heart
by
a
lance
but
the
most
illustrious
of
the
race
was
john
v
the
great
who
in
rebuilt
the
fortress
finishing
in
less
than
five
years
this
formidable
chateau
of
hautecoeur
under
whose
shelter
he
for
a
moment
dreamed
of
aspiring
to
the
throne
of
france
and
after
having
escaped
from
being
killed
in
twenty
battles
he
at
last
died
quietly
in
his
bed
to
the
king
of
scotland
then
came

made
a
pilgrimage
to

barefooted
herve
vii
who
asserted
his
claims
to
the
throne
of
scotland
and
still
many
others
noble
and
powerful
in
their
day
and
generation
down
to
jean
ix
who
under
mazarin
had
the
grief
of
assisting
at
the
dismantling
of
the
castle
after
a
desperate
siege
the
vaults
of
the
towers
and
of
the
donjon
were
blown
up
with
powder
and
the
different
constructions
were
set
on
fire
where
charles
vi
had
been
sent
to
rest
and
to
turn
his
attention
from
his
vagaries
and
where
nearly
two
hundred
years
later
henri
iv
had
passed
a
week
as
gabrielle
d
estress
thenceforth
all
these
royal
souvenirs
had
passed
into
oblivion
angelique
without
stopping
the
movement
of
her
needle
listened
eagerly
as
if
the
vision
of
these
past
grandeurs
rose
up
from
her
frame
in
proportion
as
the
rose
grew
there
in
its
delicate
life
of
colour
her
ignorance
of
general
history
enlarged
facts
and
she
received
them
as
if
they
were
the
basis
of
a
marvellous
legend
she
trembled
with
delight
and
transported
by
her
faith
it
seemed
as
if
the
reconstructed
chateau
mounted
to
the
very
gates
of
heaven
and
the
hautecoeurs
were
cousins
to
the
virgin
mary
when
there
was
a
pause
in
the
recital
she
asked
is
not
our
new
bishop
monseigneur
d
hautecoeur
a
descendant
of
this
noted
family
hubertine
replied
that
monseigneur
must
belong
to
the
younger
branch
of
the
family
as
the
elder
branch
had
been
extinct
for
a
very
long
time
it
was
indeed
a
most
singular
return
as
for
centuries
the
marquesses
of
hautecoeur
and
the
clergy
of
beaumont
had
been
hostile
to
each
other
towards
an
abbot
undertook
to
build
a
church
with
no
other
resources
than
those
of
his
order
so
his
funds
soon
gave
out
when
the
edifice
was
no
higher
than
the
arches
of
the
side
chapels
and
they
were
obliged
to
cover
the
nave
with
a
wooden
roof
eighty
years
passed
and
jean
v
came
to
rebuild
the
chateau
when
he
gave
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
which
added
to
other
sums
enabled
the
work
on
the
church
to
be
continued
the
nave
was
finished
but
the
two
towers
and
the
great
front
were
terminated
much
later
towards
in
the
full
fifteenth
century
to
recompense
jean
v
for
his
liberality
the
clergy
accorded
to
him
for
himself
and
his
descendants
the
right
of
burial
in
a
chapel
of
the
apse
consecrated
to
george
and
which
since
that
time
had
been
called
the
chapel
hautecoeur
but
these
good
terms
were
not
of
long
duration
the
freedom
of
beaumont
was
put
in
constant
peril
by
the
chateau
and
there
were
continual
hostilities
on
the
questions
of
tribute
and
of
precedence
one
especially
the
right
of
paying
toll
which
the
nobles
demanded
for
the
navigation
of
the
ligneul
perpetuated
the
quarrels
then
it
was
that
the
great
prosperity
of
the
lower
town
began
with
its
manufacturing
of
fine
linen
and
lace
and
from
this
epoch
the
fortune
of
beaumont
increased
daily
while
that
of
hautecoeur
diminished
until
the
time
when
the
castle
was
dismantled
and
the
church
triumphed
louis
xiv
made
of
it
a
cathedral
a
bishop
s
palace
was
built
in
the
old
enclosure
of
the
monks
and
by
a
singular
chain
of
circumstances
a
member
of
the
family
of
hautecoeur
had
returned
as
a
bishop
to
command
the
clergy
who
always
powerful
had
conquered
his
ancestors
after
a
contest
of
four
hundred
years
but
said
angelique
monseigneur
has
been
married
and
has
not
he
a
son
at
least
twenty
years
of
age
hubertine
had
taken
up
the
shears
to
remodel
one
of
the
pieces
of
vellum
yes
she
replied
the
abbot
cornille
told
me
the
whole
story
and
it
is
a
very
sad
history
when
but
twenty
years
of
age
monseigneur
was
a
captain
under
charles
x
in
when
only
he
resigned
his
position
in
the
army
and
it
is
said
that
from
that
time
until
he
was
forty
years
of
age
he
led
an
adventurous
life
travelling
everywhere
and
having
many
strange
experiences
at
last
one
evening
he
met
at
the
house
of
a
friend
in
the
country
the
daughter
of
the
count
de
valencay
mademoiselle
pauline
very
wealthy
marvellously
beautiful
and
scarcely
nineteen
years
of
age
years
younger
than
himself
he
fell
violently
in
love
with
her
and
as
she
returned
his
affection
there
was
no
reason
why
the
marriage
should
not
take
place
at
once
he
then
bought
the
ruins
of
hautecoeur
for
a
mere
song
ten
thousand
francs
i
believe
with
the
intention
of
repairing
the
chateau
and
installing
his
wife
therein
when
all
would
be
in
order
and
in
readiness
to
receive
her
in
the
meanwhile
they
went
to
live
on
one
of
his
family
estates
in
anjou
scarcely
seeing
any
of
their
friends
and
finding
in
their
united
happiness
the
days
all
too
short
but
alas
at
the
end
of
a
year
pauline
had
a
son
and
hubert
who
was
still
occupied
with
marking
out
his
pattern
raised
his
head
showing
a
very
pale
face
as
he
said
in
a
low
voice
oh
the
unhappy
man
it
was
said
that
he
himself
almost
died
from
his
great
grief
continued
hubertine
at
all
events
a
fortnight
later
he
entered
into
holy
orders
and
soon
became
a
priest
that
was
twenty
years
ago
and
now
he
is
a
bishop
but
i
have
also
been
told
that
during
all
this
time
he
has
refused
to
see
his
son
the
child
whose
birth
cost
the
life
of
its
mother
he
had
placed
him
with
an
uncle
of
his
wife
s
an
old
abbot
not
wishing
even
to
hear
of
him
and
trying
to
forget
his
existence
one
day
a
picture
of
the
boy
was
sent
him
but
in
looking
at
it
he
found
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
his
beloved
dead
that
he
fell
on
the
floor
unconscious
and
stiff
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
from
a
hammer
now
age
and
prayer
have
helped
to
soften
his
deep
grief
for
yesterday
the
good
father
cornille
told
me
that
monseigneur
had
just
decided
to
send
for
his
son
to
come
to
angelique
having
finished
her
rose
so
fresh
and
natural
that
perfume
seemed
to
be
exhaled
from
it
looked
again
through
the
window
into
the
sunny
garden
and
as
if
in
a
reverie
she
said
in
a
low
voice
the
son
of
monseigneur
hubertine
continued
her
story
it
seems
that
the
young
man
is
handsome
as
a
god
and
his
father
wished
him
to
be
educated
for
the
priesthood
but
the
old
abbot
would
not
consent
to
that
saying
that
the
youth
had
not
the
slightest
inclination
in
that
direction
and
then
to
crown
all
his
wealth
it
is
said
is
enormous
two
million
pounds
sterling
yes
indeed
his
mother
left
him
a
tenth
of
that
sum
which
was
invested
in
land
in
paris
where
the
increase
in
the
price
of
real
estate
has
been
so
great
that
it
represents
fifty
millions
of
francs
in
short
rich
as
a
king
rich
as
a
king
beautiful
as
a
god
repeated
angelique
unconsciously
in
her
dreamy
voice
and
with
one
hand
she
mechanically
took
from
the
frame
a
bobbin
wound
with
gold
thread
in
order
to
make
the
centre
of
one
of
the
large
lilies
after
having
loosened
the
end
from
the
point
of
the
reel
she
fastened
it
with
a
double
stitch
of
silk
to
the
edge
of
the
vellum
which
was
to
give
a
thickness
to
the
embroidery
then
continuing
her
work
she
said
again
without
finishing
her
thought
which
seemed
lost
in
the
vagueness
of
its
desire
oh
as
for
me
what
i
would
like
that
which
i
would
like
above
all
else
the
silence
fell
again
deep
and
profound
broken
only
by
the
dull
sound
of
chanting
which
came
from
the
church
hubert
arranged
his
design
by
repassing
with
a
little
brush
all
the
perforated
lines
of
the
drawing
and
thus
the
ornamentation
of
the
cope
appeared
in
white
on
the
red
silk
it
was
he
who
first
resumed
speaking
ah
those
ancient
days
were
magnificent
noblemen
then
wore
costumes
weighted
with
embroidery
at
lyons
material
was
sometimes
sold
for
as
much
as
six
hundred
francs
an
ell
one
ought
to
read
the
and
regulations
of
the
guild
of
master
workmen
where
it
is
laid
down
that
the
embroiderers
of
the
king
have
always
the
right
to
summon
by
armed
force
if
necessary
the
workmen
of
other
and
then
we
had
coats
of
arms
too
azure
a
fesso
engrailed
or
between
three
of
the
same
two
of
them
being
near
the
top
and
the
third
in
the
point
ah
it
was
indeed
beautiful
in
the
days
of
long
ago
he
stopped
a
moment
tapping
the
frame
with
his
fingers
to
shake
off
the
dust
then
he
continued
at
beaumont
they
still
have
a
legend
about
the
hautecoeurs
which
my
mother
often
related
to
me
when
i
was
a
child
a
frightful
plague
ravaged
the
town
and
half
of
the
inhabitants
had
already
fallen
victims
to
it
when
jean
v
he
who
had
rebuilt
the
fortress
perceived
that
god
had
given
him
the
power
to
contend
against
the
scourge
then
he
went
on
foot
to
the
houses
of
the
sick
fell
on
his
knees
kissed
them
and
as
soon
as
his
lips
had
touched
them
while
he
said
if
god
is
willing
i
wish
it
the
sufferers
were
healed
and
lo
that
is
why
these
words
have
remained
the
device
of
the
hautecoeurs
who
all
have
since
that
day
been
able
to
cure
the
plague
ah
what
a
proud
race
of
men
a
noble
dynasty
monseigneur
himself
is
called
jean
xii
and
the
first
name
of
his
son
must
also
be
followed
by
a
number
like
that
of
a
he
stopped
each
one
of
his
words
lulled
and
prolonged
the
reverie
of
angelique
she
continued
in
a
tone
oh
what
i
wish
for
myself
that
which
i
would
like
above
all
else
holding
the
bobbin
without
touching
the
thread
she
twisted
the
gold
by
moving
it
from
left
to
right
alternately
on
the
vellum
fastening
it
at
each
turn
with
a
stitch
in
silk
little
by
little
the
great
golden
lily
blossomed
out
soon
she
continued
yes
what
i
would
like
above
all
would
be
to
marry
a
prince
a
prince
whom
i
had
never
seen
who
would
come
towards
sunset
just
before
the
waning
daylight
and
would
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
to
his
palace
and
i
should
wish
him
to
be
very
handsome
as
well
as
very
rich
yes
the
most
beautiful
and
the
wealthiest
man
that
had
ever
been
seen
on
the
earth
he
should
have
superb
horses
that
i
could
hear
neighing
under
my
windows
and
jewels
which
he
would
pour
in
streams
into
my
lap
and
gold
that
would
fall
from
my
hands
in
a
deluge
when
i
opened
them
and
what
i
wish
still
further
is
that
this
prince
of
mine
should
love
me
to
distraction
so
that
i
might
also
love
him
desperately
we
would
then
remain
very
young
very
good
and
very
noble
for
ever
hubert
leaving
his
work
had
approached
her
smilingly
whilst
hubertine
in
a
friendly
way
shook
her
finger
at
the
young
girl
oh
what
a
vain
little
creature
ah
ambitious
child
you
are
quite
incorrigible
now
you
are
quite
beside
yourself
with
your
need
of
being
a
queen
at
all
events
such
a
dream
is
much
better
than
to
steal
sugar
and
to
be
impertinent
but
really
you
must
not
indulge
in
such
fancies
it
is
the
evil
one
who
prompts
them
and
it
is
pride
that
speaks
as
well
as
gay
and
candid
angelique
looked
her
in
the
face
as
she
said
but
mother
mother
mine
what
are
you
saying
is
it
then
a
sin
to
love
that
which
is
rich
and
beautiful
i
love
it
because
it
is
rich
and
beautiful
and
so
cheers
my
heart
and
soul
a
beautiful
object
brightens
everything
that
is
near
it
and
helps
one
to
live
as
the
sun
does
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
not
selfish
money
oh
you
would
see
what
a
good
use
i
would
make
of
it
if
only
i
had
it
in
abundance
i
would
rain
it
over
the
town
it
should
be
scattered
among
the
miserable
think
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
to
have
no
more
poverty
in
the
first
place
as
for
you
and
my
father
i
would
give
you
everything
you
should
be
dressed
in
robes
and
garments
of
brocades
like
the
lords
and
ladies
of
the
olden
hubertine
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
it
is
ridiculous
she
said
but
my
dear
child
you
must
remember
that
you
are
poor
and
that
you
have
not
a
penny
for
your
how
can
you
then
for
a
moment
dream
of
a
prince
are
you
then
so
desirous
to
marry
a
prince
why
should
not
i
wish
to
marry
such
a
man
and
she
looked
quite
amazed
as
she
continued
marry
him
of
course
i
would
do
so
since
he
would
have
plenty
of
money
what
difference
would
it
make
if
i
had
none
i
should
owe
everything
to
him
and
on
that
very
account
i
should
love
him
all
the
more
this
victorious
reasoning
enchanted
hubert
who
seemed
carried
above
the
earth
by
angelique
s
enthusiasm
he
would
willingly
have
accompanied
her
on
the
wings
of
a
cloud
to
the
regions
of
fancy
she
is
right
he
exclaimed
but
his
wife
glanced
at
him
reprovingly
she
became
quite
stern
my
child
you
will
think
differently
later
on
when
you
know
life
life
but
i
know
it
how
is
it
possible
for
you
to
know
it
you
are
too
young
you
are
ignorant
of
evil
yet
evil
exists
and
is
very
evil
evil
angelique
repeated
the
word
very
slowly
as
if
to
penetrate
its
meaning
and
in
her
pure
eyes
was
a
look
of
innocent
surprise
evil
she
knew
all
about
it
for
she
had
read
of
it
in
the
golden
was
not
evil
satan
himself
and
had
not
she
seen
how
although
he
constantly
reappeared
he
was
always
overthrown
after
every
battle
he
remained
crushed
to
earth
thoroughly
conquered
and
in
a
most
pitiable
state
evil
ah
mother
mine
if
you
knew
how
little
i
fear
it
it
is
only
necessary
once
to
conquer
it
and
afterwards
life
is
all
hubertine
appeared
troubled
and
looked
anxious
you
will
make
me
almost
regret
having
brought
you
up
in
this
house
alone
with
us
two
and
away
from
the
world
as
it
were
i
am
really
afraid
that
some
day
we
shall
regret
having
kept
you
in
such
complete
ignorance
of
the
realities
of
life
what
paradise
are
you
looking
for
what
is
your
idea
of
the
world
a
look
of
hope
brightened
the
face
of
the
young
girl
while
bending
forward
she
still
moved
the
bobbin
back
and
forth
with
a
continuous
even
motion
you
then
really
think
mother
that
i
am
very
foolish
do
you
not
this
world
is
full
of
brave
people
when
one
is
honest
and
industrious
one
is
always
rewarded
i
know
also
that
there
are
some
bad
people
but
they
do
not
count
we
do
not
associate
with
them
and
they
are
soon
punished
for
their
misdeeds
and
then
you
see
as
for
the
world
it
produces
on
me
from
a
distance
the
effect
of
a
great
garden
yes
of
an
immense
park
all
filled
with
flowers
and
with
sunshine
it
is
such
a
blessing
to
live
and
life
is
so
sweet
that
it
can
not
be
she
grew
excited
as
if
intoxicated
by
the
brightness
of
the
silks
and
the
gold
threads
she
manipulated
so
well
with
her
skilful
fingers
happiness
is
a
very
simple
thing
we
are
happy
are
we
not
all
three
of
us
and
why
simply
because
we
love
each
other
then
after
all
it
is
no
more
difficult
than
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
love
and
to
be
loved
so
you
see
when
the
one
i
expect
really
comes
we
shall
recognise
each
other
immediately
it
is
true
i
have
not
yet
seen
him
but
i
know
exactly
what
he
ought
to
be
he
will
enter
here
and
will
say
i
have
come
in
search
of
and
i
shall
reply
i
expected
you
and
will
go
with
he
will
take
me
with
him
and
our
future
will
be
at
once
decided
upon
he
will
go
into
a
palace
where
all
the
furniture
will
be
of
gold
encrusted
in
diamonds
oh
it
is
all
very
simple
you
are
crazy
so
do
not
talk
any
more
interrupted
hubertine
coldly
and
seeing
that
the
young
girl
was
still
excited
and
ready
to
continue
to
indulge
her
fancies
she
continued
to
reprove
her
i
beg
you
to
say
no
more
for
you
absolutely
make
me
tremble
unhappy
child
when
we
really
marry
you
to
some
poor
mortal
you
will
be
crushed
as
you
fall
to
earth
from
these
heights
of
the
imagination
happiness
for
the
greater
part
of
the
world
consists
in
humility
and
angelique
continued
to
smile
with
an
almost
obstinate
tranquillity
i
expect
him
and
he
will
but
she
is
right
exclaimed
hubert
again
carried
away
by
her
enthusiasm
why
need
you
scold
her
she
is
certainly
pretty
and
dainty
enough
for
a
king
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
and
who
knows
what
may
come
sadly
hubertine
looked
at
him
with
her
calm
eyes
do
not
encourage
her
to
do
wrong
my
dear
you
know
better
than
anyone
what
it
costs
to
follow
too
much
the
impulses
of
one
s
he
turned
deadly
pale
and
great
tears
came
to
the
edge
of
his
eyelids
she
immediately
repented
of
having
reproved
him
and
rose
to
offer
him
her
hands
but
gently
disengaging
himself
he
said
stammeringly
no
no
my
dear
i
was
wrong
angelique
do
you
understand
me
you
must
always
listen
to
your
mother
she
alone
is
wise
and
we
are
both
of
us
very
foolish
i
am
wrong
yes
i
acknowledge
too
disturbed
to
sit
down
leaving
the
cope
upon
which
he
had
been
working
he
occupied
himself
in
pasting
a
banner
that
was
finished
although
still
in
its
frame
after
having
taken
the
pot
of
flemish
glue
from
the
chest
of
drawers
he
moistened
with
a
brush
the
underside
of
the
material
to
make
the
embroidery
firmer
his
lips
still
trembled
and
he
remained
quiet
but
if
angelique
in
her
obedience
was
also
still
she
allowed
her
thoughts
to
follow
their
course
and
her
fancies
mounted
higher
and
still
higher
she
showed
it
in
every
feature
in
her
mouth
that
ecstasy
had
half
opened
as
well
as
in
her
eyes
where
the
infinite
depth
of
her
visions
seemed
reflected
now
this
dream
of
a
poor
girl
she
wove
it
into
the
golden
embroidery
it
was
for
this
unknown
hero
that
little
by
little
there
seemed
to
grow
on
the
white
satin
the
beautiful
great
lilies
and
the
roses
and
the
monogram
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
stems
of
the
lilies
had
all
the
gracious
pointings
of
a
jet
of
light
whilst
the
long
slender
leaves
made
of
spangles
each
one
being
sewed
on
with
gold
twist
fell
in
a
shower
of
stars
in
the
centre
the
initials
of
mary
were
like
the
dazzling
of
a
relief
in
massive
gold
a
marvellous
blending
of
lacework
and
of
embossing
or
goffering
which
burnt
like
the
glory
of
a
tabernacle
in
the
mystic
fire
of
its
rays
and
the
roses
of
silks
seemed
real
and
the
whole
chasuble
was
resplendent
in
its
whiteness
of
satin
which
appeared
covered
almost
miraculously
with
its
golden
blossoms
after
a
long
silence
angelique
whose
cheeks
were
flushed
by
the
blood
which
mounted
into
them
from
her
excitement
raised
her
head
and
looking
at
hubertine
said
again
a
little
maliciously
i
expect
him
and
he
will
it
was
absurd
for
her
thus
to
give
loose
reins
to
her
imagination
but
she
was
willful
she
was
convinced
in
her
own
mind
that
everything
would
come
to
pass
eventually
as
she
wished
it
might
nothing
could
weaken
her
happy
conviction
mother
she
added
why
do
you
not
believe
me
since
i
assure
you
it
must
be
as
i
say
hubertine
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
concluded
the
best
thing
for
her
to
do
was
to
tease
her
but
i
thought
my
child
that
you
never
intended
being
married
your
saints
who
seem
to
have
turned
your
head
they
led
single
lives
rather
than
do
otherwise
they
converted
their
lovers
ran
away
from
their
homes
and
were
put
to
the
young
girl
listened
and
was
confused
but
soon
she
laughed
merrily
her
perfect
health
and
all
her
love
of
life
rang
out
in
this
sonorous
gaiety
the
histories
of
the
saints
but
that
was
ages
ago
times
have
entirely
changed
since
then
god
having
so
completely
triumphed
no
longer
demands
that
anyone
should
die
for
when
reading
the
legend
it
was
the
marvels
which
fascinated
her
not
the
contempt
of
the
world
and
the
desire
for
death
she
added
most
certainly
i
expect
to
be
married
to
love
and
to
be
loved
and
thus
be
very
be
careful
my
dear
said
hubertine
continuing
to
tease
her
you
will
make
your
guardian
angel
saint
agnes
weep
do
not
you
know
that
she
refused
the
son
of
the
governor
and
preferred
to
die
that
she
might
be
wedded
to
jesus
the
great
clock
of
the
belfry
began
to
strike
numbers
of
sparrows
flew
down
from
an
enormous
which
framed
one
of
the
windows
of
the
apse
in
the
workroom
hubert
still
silent
had
just
hung
up
the
banner
moist
from
the
glue
that
it
might
dry
on
one
of
the
great
iron
hooks
fastened
to
the
wall
the
sun
in
the
course
of
the
morning
had
lightened
up
different
parts
of
the
room
and
now
it
shone
brightly
upon
the
old
tools
the
diligent
the
wicker
winder
and
the
brass
chandelier
and
as
its
rays
fell
upon
the
two
workers
the
frame
at
which
they
were
seated
seemed
almost
on
fire
with
its
bands
polished
by
use
and
with
the
various
objects
placed
upon
it
the
reels
of
gold
cord
the
spangles
and
the
bobbins
of
silk
then
in
this
soft
charming
air
of
spring
angelique
looked
at
the
beautiful
symbolic
lily
she
had
just
finished
opening
wide
her
ingenuous
eyes
she
replied
with
an
air
of
confiding
happiness
to
hubertine
s
last
remark
in
regard
to
the
saint
agnes
ah
yes
but
it
was
jesus
who
wished
it
to
be
chapter
v
notwithstanding
her
thoroughly
cheerful
nature
angelique
liked
solitude
and
it
was
to
her
the
greatest
of
recreations
to
be
alone
in
her
room
morning
and
evening
there
she
gave
herself
up
to
her
thoughts
there
she
indulged
to
the
full
scope
in
her
most
joyous
fancies
sometimes
even
during
the
day
when
she
could
go
there
for
a
moment
she
was
as
happy
as
if
in
full
freedom
she
had
committed
some
childish
prank
the
chamber
was
very
large
taking
in
at
least
half
of
the
upper
story
the
other
half
being
the
garret
it
was
whitewashed
everywhere
not
only
the
walls
and
the
beams
but
the
joists
even
to
the
visible
copings
of
the
mansard
part
of
the
roof
and
in
this
bare
whiteness
the
old
oaken
furniture
seemed
almost
as
black
as
ebony
at
the
time
of
the
decoration
of
the
below
and
the
improvements
made
in
the
parlour
the
ancient
furniture
which
had
been
bought
at
various
epochs
had
been
carried
upstairs
there
was
a
great
carved
chest
of
the
renaissance
period
a
table
and
chairs
which
dated
from
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
an
enormous
bedstead
style
louis
xiv
and
a
very
handsome
wardrobe
louis
xv
in
the
middle
of
these
venerable
old
things
a
white
porcelain
stove
and
the
little
covered
with
a
pretty
oilcloth
seemed
out
of
place
and
to
mar
the
dull
harmony
curtained
with
an
chintz
on
which
were
bouquets
of
heather
so
faded
that
the
colour
had
become
a
scarcely
perceptible
pink
the
enormous
bedstead
preserved
above
all
the
majesty
of
its
great
age
but
what
pleased
angelique
more
than
anything
else
was
the
little
balcony
on
which
the
window
opened
of
the
two
original
windows
one
of
them
that
at
the
left
had
been
closed
by
simply
fastening
it
with
nails
and
the
balcony
which
formerly
extended
across
the
front
of
the
building
was
now
only
before
the
window
at
the
right
as
the
lower
beams
were
still
strong
a
new
floor
had
been
made
and
above
it
an
iron
railing
was
firmly
attached
in
place
of
the
old
wooden
balustrade
this
made
a
charming
little
corner
a
quiet
nook
under
the
gable
point
the
leaden
laths
of
which
had
been
renewed
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
by
bending
over
a
little
the
whole
of
the
house
could
be
seen
in
a
very
dilapidated
state
with
its
of
little
cut
stones
its
panels
ornamented
with
imitation
bricks
and
its
large
bay
window
which
had
been
made
somewhat
smaller
the
roof
of
the
great
porch
of
the
was
covered
with
zinc
and
above
the
interduces
of
the
top
which
projected
three
feet
or
more
were
strengthened
by
large
upright
pieces
of
wood
the
ends
of
which
rested
on
the
of
the
first
floor
all
this
gave
to
the
balcony
an
appearance
of
being
in
a
perfect
vegetation
of
timber
as
if
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
of
old
wood
which
was
green
with
wallflowers
and
moss
since
she
occupied
the
chamber
angelique
had
spent
many
hours
there
leaning
over
the
balustrade
and
simply
looking
at
first
directly
under
her
was
the
garden
darkened
by
the
eternal
shade
of
the
evergreen
in
the
corner
nearest
the
church
a
cluster
of
small
surrounded
an
old
granite
bench
while
in
the
opposite
corner
half
hidden
by
a
beautiful
ivy
which
covered
the
whole
wall
at
the
end
as
if
with
a
mantle
was
a
little
door
opening
upon
the
a
vast
uncultivated
field
this
was
the
old
orchard
of
the
monks
a
rivulet
of
purest
crossed
it
the
chevrotte
where
the
women
who
occupied
the
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
had
the
privilege
of
washing
their
linen
certain
poor
people
sheltered
themselves
in
the
ruins
of
an
old
mill
and
no
other
persons
inhabited
this
field
which
was
connected
with
the
rue
magloire
simply
by
the
narrow
lane
of
the
guerdaches
which
passed
between
the
high
walls
of
the
bishop
s
palace
and
those
of
the
hotel
voincourt
in
summer
the
centenarian
elms
of
the
two
parks
barred
with
their
tops
the
straight
limited
horizon
which
in
the
centre
was
cut
off
by
the
gigantic
brow
of
the
cathedral
thus
shut
in
on
all
sides
the
slept
in
the
quiet
peace
of
its
abandonment
overrun
with
weeds
and
wild
grass
planted
with
poplars
and
willows
sown
by
the
wind
among
the
great
pebbles
the
chevrotte
leaped
singing
as
it
went
and
making
a
continuous
music
as
if
of
crystal
angelique
was
never
weary
of
this
nook
yet
for
seven
years
she
had
seen
there
each
morning
only
what
she
had
looked
at
on
the
previous
evening
the
trees
in
the
little
park
of
the
hotel
voincourt
whose
front
was
on
the
grand
rue
were
so
tufted
and
bushy
that
it
was
only
in
the
winter
she
could
occasionally
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
daughter
of
the
countess
mademoiselle
claire
a
young
girl
of
her
own
age
in
the
garden
of
the
bishop
was
a
still
more
dense
thickness
of
branches
and
she
had
often
tried
in
vain
to
distinguish
there
the
cassock
of
monseigneur
and
the
old
gate
with
its
venetian
slats
above
and
at
the
sides
must
have
been
fastened
up
for
a
very
long
time
for
she
never
remembered
to
have
seen
it
opened
not
even
for
a
gardener
to
pass
through
besides
the
washerwomen
in
the
clos
she
always
saw
the
same
poor
ragged
little
children
playing
or
sleeping
in
the
grass
the
spring
this
year
was
unusually
mild
she
was
just
sixteen
years
of
age
and
until
now
she
had
been
glad
to
welcome
with
her
eyes
alone
the
growing
green
again
of
the
under
the
april
sunshine
the
shooting
out
of
the
tender
leaves
the
transparency
of
the
warm
evenings
and
all
the
reviving
odours
of
the
earth
had
simply
amused
her
heretofore
but
this
year
at
the
first
bud
her
heart
seemed
to
beat
more
quickly
as
the
grass
grew
higher
and
the
wind
brought
to
her
all
the
strong
perfumes
of
the
fresh
verdure
there
was
in
her
whole
being
an
increasing
agitation
sudden
inexplicable
pain
would
at
times
seize
her
throat
and
almost
choke
her
one
evening
she
threw
herself
weeping
into
hubertine
s
arms
having
no
cause
whatever
for
grief
but
on
the
contrary
overwhelmed
with
so
great
unknown
a
happiness
that
her
heart
was
too
full
for
restraint
in
the
night
her
dreams
were
delightful
shadows
seemed
to
pass
before
her
and
she
fell
into
such
an
ecstatic
state
that
on
awakening
she
did
not
dare
to
recall
them
so
confused
was
she
by
the
angelic
visions
of
bliss
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
her
great
bed
she
would
rouse
herself
suddenly
her
two
hands
joined
and
pressed
against
her
breast
as
if
a
heavy
burden
were
weighing
her
down
and
almost
suffocating
her
she
would
then
jump
up
rush
across
the
room
in
her
bare
feet
and
opening
the
window
wide
would
stand
there
trembling
slightly
until
at
last
the
pure
fresh
air
calmed
her
she
was
continually
surprised
at
this
great
change
in
herself
as
if
the
knowledge
of
joys
and
griefs
hitherto
unknown
had
been
revealed
to
her
in
the
enchantment
of
dreams
and
that
her
eyes
had
been
opened
to
natural
beauties
which
surrounded
her
what
was
it
really
true
that
the
unseen
lilacs
and
laburnums
of
the
bishop
s
garden
had
so
sweet
an
odour
that
she
could
no
longer
breathe
it
without
a
flush
of
colour
mounting
to
her
cheeks
never
before
had
she
perceived
this
warmth
of
perfume
which
now
touched
her
as
if
with
a
living
breath
and
again
why
had
she
never
remarked
in
preceding
years
a
great
japanese
paulownia
in
blossom
which
looked
like
an
immense
violet
bouquet
as
it
appeared
between
two
in
the
garden
of
the
voincourts
this
year
as
soon
as
she
looked
at
it
her
eyes
grew
moist
so
much
was
she
affected
by
the
delicate
tints
of
the
pale
purple
flowers
she
also
fancied
that
the
chevrotte
had
never
chattered
so
gaily
over
the
pebbles
among
the
willows
on
its
banks
the
river
certainly
talked
she
listened
to
its
vague
words
constantly
repeated
which
filled
her
heart
with
trouble
was
it
then
no
longer
the
field
of
other
days
that
everything
in
it
so
astonished
her
and
affected
her
senses
in
so
unusual
a
way
or
rather
was
not
she
herself
so
changed
that
for
the
first
time
she
appreciated
the
beauty
of
the
coming
into
life
of
trees
and
plants
but
the
cathedral
at
her
right
the
enormous
mass
which
obstructed
the
sky
surprised
her
yet
more
each
morning
she
seemed
to
see
it
for
the
first
time
she
made
constant
discoveries
in
it
and
was
delighted
to
think
that
these
old
stones
lived
and
had
lived
like
herself
she
did
not
reason
at
all
on
the
subject
she
had
very
little
knowledge
but
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
mystic
flight
of
the
giant
whose
coming
into
existence
had
demanded
three
centuries
of
time
and
where
were
placed
one
above
the
other
the
faith
and
the
belief
of
generations
at
the
foundation
it
was
kneeling
as
if
crushed
by
prayer
with
the
romanesque
chapels
of
the
nave
and
with
the
round
arched
windows
plain
unornamented
except
by
slender
columns
under
the
archivolts
then
it
seemed
to
rise
lifting
its
face
and
hands
towards
heaven
with
the
pointed
windows
of
its
nave
built
eighty
years
later
high
delicate
windows
divided
by
mullions
on
which
were
broken
bows
and
roses
then
again
it
sprung
from
the
earth
as
if
in
ecstasy
erect
with
the
piers
and
flying
buttresses
of
the
choir
finished
and
ornamented
two
centuries
after
in
the
fullest
flamboyant
gothic
charged
with
its
spires
and
pinnacles
a
balustrade
had
been
added
ornamented
with
trefoils
bordering
the
terrace
on
the
chapels
of
the
apse
gargoyles
at
the
foot
of
the
flying
buttresses
carried
off
the
water
from
the
roofs
the
top
was
also
decorated
with
flowery
emblems
the
whole
edifice
seemed
to
burst
into
blossom
in
proportion
as
it
approached
the
sky
in
a
continual
upward
flight
as
if
relieved
at
being
delivered
from
the
ancient
sacerdotal
terror
it
was
about
to
lose
itself
in
the
bosom
of
a
god
of
pardon
and
of
love
it
seemed
to
have
a
physical
sensation
which
permeated
it
made
it
light
and
happy
like
a
sacred
hymn
it
had
just
heard
sung
very
pure
and
holy
as
it
passed
into
the
upper
air
moreover
the
cathedral
was
alive
hundreds
of
swallows
had
constructed
their
nests
under
the
borders
of
trefoil
and
even
in
the
hollows
of
the
and
the
pinnacles
and
they
were
continually
brushing
their
wings
against
the
flying
buttresses
and
the
piers
which
they
inhabited
there
were
also
the
of
the
elms
in
the
bishop
s
garden
who
held
themselves
up
proudly
on
the
borders
of
the
terraces
going
slowly
as
if
walking
merely
to
show
themselves
off
sometimes
half
lost
in
the
blue
sky
looking
scarcely
larger
than
a
fly
a
crow
alighted
on
the
point
of
a
spire
to
smooth
its
wings
the
old
stones
themselves
were
animated
by
the
quiet
working
of
the
roots
of
a
whole
flora
of
plants
the
lichens
and
the
grasses
which
pushed
themselves
through
the
openings
in
the
walls
on
very
stormy
days
the
entire
apse
seemed
to
awake
and
to
grumble
under
the
noise
of
the
rain
as
it
beat
against
the
leaden
tiles
of
the
roof
running
off
by
the
gutters
of
the
cornices
and
rolling
from
story
to
story
with
the
clamour
of
an
overflowing
torrent
even
the
terrible
winds
of
october
and
of
march
gave
to
it
a
soul
a
double
voice
of
anger
and
of
supplication
as
they
whistled
through
its
forests
of
gables
and
arcades
of
roseate
ornaments
and
of
little
columns
the
sun
also
filled
it
with
life
from
the
changing
play
of
its
rays
from
the
early
morning
which
rejuvenated
it
with
a
delicate
gaiety
even
to
the
evening
when
under
the
slightly
shadows
it
basked
in
the
unknown
and
it
had
its
interior
existence
the
ceremonies
with
which
it
was
ever
vibrating
the
constant
swinging
of
its
bells
the
music
of
the
organ
and
the
chanting
of
the
priests
all
these
were
like
the
pulsation
of
its
veins
there
was
always
a
living
murmur
in
it
sounds
like
the
faint
echo
of
a
low
mass
the
rustling
of
the
kneeling
penitents
a
slight
scarcely
perceptible
shivering
nothing
but
the
devout
ardour
of
a
prayer
said
without
words
and
with
closed
lips
now
as
the
days
grew
longer
angelique
passed
more
and
more
time
in
the
morning
and
evening
with
her
elbows
on
the
balustrade
of
the
balcony
side
by
side
with
her
great
friend
the
cathedral
she
loved
it
the
best
at
night
when
she
saw
the
enormous
mass
detach
itself
like
a
huge
block
on
the
starry
skies
the
form
of
the
building
was
lost
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
could
even
distinguish
the
flying
buttresses
which
were
thrown
like
bridges
into
the
empty
space
it
was
nevertheless
awake
in
the
darkness
filled
with
a
dream
of
seven
centuries
made
grand
by
the
multitudes
who
had
hoped
or
despaired
before
its
altars
it
was
a
continual
watch
coming
from
the
infinite
of
the
past
going
to
the
eternity
of
the
future
the
mysterious
and
terrifying
wakefulness
of
a
house
where
god
himself
never
sleeps
and
in
the
dark
motionless
living
mass
her
looks
were
sure
to
seek
the
window
of
a
chapel
of
the
choir
on
the
level
of
the
bushes
of
the
the
only
one
which
was
lighted
up
and
which
seemed
like
an
eye
which
was
kept
open
all
the
night
behind
it
at
the
corner
of
a
pillar
was
an
in
fact
it
was
the
same
chapel
which
the
abbots
of
old
had
given
to
jean
v
d
hautecoeur
and
to
his
descendants
with
the
right
of
being
buried
there
in
return
for
their
liberality
dedicated
to
saint
george
it
had
a
window
of
the
twelfth
century
on
which
was
painted
the
legend
of
the
saint
from
the
moment
of
the
coming
on
of
twilight
this
historic
representation
came
out
from
the
shade
lighted
up
as
if
it
were
an
apparition
and
that
was
why
angelique
was
fascinated
and
loved
this
particular
point
as
she
gazed
at
it
with
her
dreamy
eyes
the
background
of
the
window
was
blue
and
the
edges
red
upon
this
sombre
richness
of
colouring
the
personages
whose
flying
draperies
allowed
their
limbs
to
be
seen
stood
out
in
relief
in
clear
light
on
the
glass
three
scenes
of
the
legend
placed
one
above
the
other
filled
the
space
quite
to
the
upper
arch
at
the
bottom
the
daughter
of
the
king
dressed
in
costly
royal
robes
on
her
way
from
the
city
to
be
eaten
by
the
dreadful
monster
meets
saint
george
near
the
pond
from
which
the
head
of
the
dragon
already
appears
and
a
streamer
of
silk
bears
these
words
good
knight
do
not
run
any
danger
for
me
as
you
can
neither
help
me
nor
deliver
me
but
will
have
to
perish
with
then
in
the
middle
the
combat
takes
place
and
the
saint
on
horseback
cuts
the
beast
through
and
through
this
is
explained
by
the
following
words
george
wielded
so
well
his
lance
that
he
wounded
the
enemy
and
threw
him
upon
the
at
last
at
the
top
the
princess
is
seen
leading
back
into
the
city
the
conquered
dragon
george
said
tie
your
scarf
around
his
neck
and
do
not
be
afraid
of
anything
oh
beautiful
maiden
for
when
you
have
done
so
he
will
follow
you
like
a
when
the
window
was
new
it
must
have
been
surmounted
in
the
middle
of
the
arch
by
an
ornamental
design
but
later
when
the
chapel
belonged
to
the
hautecoeurs
they
replaced
the
original
work
by
their
family
coat
of
arms
and
that
was
why
in
the
obscure
nights
armorial
bearings
of
a
more
recent
date
shown
out
above
the
painted
legend
they
were
the
old
family
arms
of
hautecoeur
quartered
with
the
shield
of
jerusalem
the
latter
being
argent
a
cross
potencee
or
between
four
crosselettes
of
the
same
and
those
of
the
family
azure
a
castle
or
on
it
a
shield
sable
charged
with
a
human
heart
argent
the
whole
between
three
or
the
shield
was
supported
on
the
dexter
and
sinister
sides
by
two
wyverns
or
and
surmounted
by
the
silver
helmet
with
its
blue
feathers
embossed
in
gold
placed
frontwise
and
closed
by
eleven
bars
which
belongs
only
to
dukes
marshals
of
france
titled
lords
and
heads
of
sovereign
corporations
and
for
motto
were
these
words
dieu
volt
ie
little
by
little
from
having
seen
him
piercing
the
monster
with
his
lance
whilst
the
king
s
daughter
raised
her
clasped
hands
in
supplication
angelique
became
enamoured
of
saint
george
he
was
her
hero
at
the
distance
where
she
was
she
could
not
well
distinguish
the
figures
and
she
looked
at
them
as
if
in
the
aggrandisement
of
a
dream
the
young
girl
was
slight
was
a
blonde
and
in
short
had
a
face
not
unlike
her
own
while
the
saint
was
frank
and
noble
looking
with
the
beauty
of
an
archangel
it
was
as
if
she
herself
had
just
been
saved
and
she
could
have
kissed
his
hands
with
gratitude
and
to
this
adventure
of
which
she
dreamed
confusedly
of
a
meeting
on
the
border
of
a
lake
and
of
being
rescued
from
a
great
danger
by
a
young
man
more
beautiful
than
the
day
was
added
the
recollection
of
her
excursion
to
the
chateau
of
hautecoeur
and
a
calling
up
to
view
of
the
feudal
donjon
in
its
original
state
peopled
with
the
noble
lords
of
olden
times
the
arms
glistened
like
the
stars
on
summer
nights
she
knew
them
well
she
read
them
easily
with
their
sonorous
words
for
she
was
so
in
the
habit
of
embroidering
heraldic
symbols
there
was
jean
v
who
stopped
from
door
to
door
in
the
town
ravaged
by
the
plague
and
went
in
to
kiss
the
lips
of
the
dying
and
cured
them
by
saying
dieu
volt
ie
and
felician
iii
who
forewarned
that
a
severe
illness
prevented
philippe
le
bel
from
going
to
palestine
went
there
in
his
place
barefooted
and
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
for
that
he
had
the
right
of
quartering
the
arms
of
jerusalem
with
his
own
other
and
yet
other
histories
came
to
her
mind
especially
those
of
the
ladies
of
hautecoeur
the
happy
dead
as
they
were
called
in
the
legend
in
that
family
the
women
die
young
in
the
midst
of
some
great
happiness
sometimes
two
or
three
generations
would
be
spared
then
suddenly
death
would
appear
smiling
as
with
gentle
hands
he
carried
away
the
daughter
or
the
wife
of
a
hautecoeur
the
oldest
of
them
being
scarcely
twenty
years
of
age
at
the
moment
when
they
were
at
the
height
of
earthly
love
and
bliss
for
instance
laurette
daughter
of
raoul
i
on
the
evening
of
her
betrothal
to
her
cousin
richard
who
lived
in
the
castle
having
seated
herself
at
her
window
in
the
tower
of
david
saw
him
at
his
window
in
the
tower
of
charlemagne
and
thinking
she
heard
him
call
her
as
at
that
moment
a
ray
of
moonlight
seemed
to
throw
a
bridge
between
them
she
walked
toward
him
but
when
in
the
middle
she
made
in
her
haste
a
false
step
and
overpassed
the
ray
she
fell
and
was
crushed
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
so
since
that
day
each
night
when
the
moon
is
bright
and
clear
she
can
be
seen
walking
in
the
air
around
the
chateau
which
is
bathed
in
white
by
the
silent
touch
of
her
immense
robe
then
balbine
wife
of
herve
vii
thought
for
six
months
that
her
husband
had
been
killed
in
the
wars
but
unwilling
to
give
up
all
hope
she
watched
for
him
daily
from
the
top
of
the
donjon
and
when
at
last
she
saw
him
one
morning
on
the
highway
returning
to
his
home
she
ran
down
quickly
to
meet
him
but
was
so
overcome
with
joy
that
she
fell
dead
at
the
entrance
of
the
castle
even
at
this
day
notwithstanding
the
ruins
as
soon
as
twilight
falls
it
is
said
she
still
descends
the
steps
runs
from
story
to
story
glides
through
the
corridors
and
the
rooms
and
passes
like
a
phantom
through
the
gaping
windows
which
open
into
the
desert
void

all
these
happy
dead
loved
by
the
stern
messenger
who
spared
them
from
the
vicissitudes
of
life
by
taking
them
suddenly
when
in
early
youth
they
thought
only
of
happiness
on
certain
nights
this
band
fill
the
house
as
if
with
a
flight
of
doves
to
their
number
had
lately
been
added
the
mother
of
the
son
of
monseigneur
who
was
found
lifeless
on
the
floor
by
the
cradle
of
her
infant
where
although
ill
she
dragged
herself
to
die
in
the
fullness
of
her
delight
at
embracing
him
these
had
haunted
the
imagination
of
angelique
she
spoke
of
them
as
if
they
were
facts
of
recent
occurrence
which
might
have
happened
the
day
before
she
had
read
the
names
of
laurette
and
of
balbine
on
old
memorial
tablets
let
into
the
walls
of
the
chapel
then
why
should
not
she
also
die
young
and
very
happy
as
they
had
the
armouries
would
glisten
as
now
the
saint
would
come
down
from
his
place
in
the
window
and
she
would
be
carried
away
to
heaven
on
the
sweet
breath
of
a
kiss
why
not
the
golden
legend
had
taught
her
this
was
not
it
true
that
the
miracle
is
really
the
common
law
and

natural
course

fine
squadron
they
floated
slowly
along
urged
by
the
breeze
through
the
whole
length
of
the
sea
until
they
reached
the
shores
of
sicily
angelique
was
a
firm
believer
in
miracles
in
her
ignorance
she
lived
surrounded
by
wonders
the
rising
of
the
stars
or
the
opening
of
a
violet
each
fact
was
a
surprise
to
her
it
would
have
appeared
to
her
simply
ridiculous
to
have
imagined
the
world
so
mechanical
as
to
be
governed
by
fixed
laws
there
were
so
many
things
far
beyond
her
comprehension
she
felt
herself
so
weak
and
helpless
in
the
midst
of
forces
whose
power
it
was
impossible
to
measure
that
she
would
not
even
have
suspected
they
existed
had
it
not
been
for
the
great
questioning
breath
which
at
times
passed
over
her
face
so
trusting
and
as
thoroughly
christian
as
if
belonging
to
the
primitive
church
spiritually
fed
by
her
readings
from
the
golden
legend
she
gave
herself
up
entirely
into
the
hands
of
god
with
only
the
spot
of
original
sin
to
be
cleansed
from
her
soul
she
had
no
liberty
of
action
or
freedom
of
will
god
alone
could
secure
her
salvation
by
giving
her
the
gift
of
his
grace
that
grace
had
been
already
manifested
by
bringing
her
to
the
hospitable
roof
of
the
huberts
where
under
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
she
could
lead
a
life
of
submission
of
purity
and
of
faith
she
often
heard
within
her
soul
the
grumblings
of
heredity
tendency
to
evil
and
asked
herself
what
would
have
become
of
her
had
she
been
left
on
her
native
soil
without
doubt
she
would
have
been
bad
while
here
in
this
blessed
corner
of
the
earth
she
had
grown
up
free
from
temptation
strong
and
healthy
was
it
not
grace
that
had
given
her
this
home
where
she
was
surrounded
by
such
charming
histories
she
had
so
easily
committed
to
memory
where
she
had
learned
such
perfect
faith
in
the
present
and
hope
in
the
future
and
where
the
invisible
and
unknown
or
the
miracles
of
ages
seemed
natural
to
her
and
quite
on
a
level
with
her
daily
life
it
had
armed
her
for
all
combats
as
heretofore
it
had
armed
the
martyrs
and
she
created
an
imaginary
experience
for
herself
almost
unknowingly
it
was
in
fact
the
inevitable
result
of
a
mind
overcharged
and
excited
by
fables
it
was
increased
by
her
ignorance
of
the
life
within
and
about
her
as
well
as
from
her
loneliness
she
had
not
had
many
companions
so
all
desires
went
from
her
only
to
return
to
her
sometimes
she
was
in
such
a
peculiar
state
that
she
would
put
her
hands
over
her
face
as
if
doubting
her
own
identity
was
she
herself
only
an
illusion
and
would
she
suddenly
disappear
some
day
and
vanish
into
nothingness
who
would
tell
her
the
truth
one
evening
in
the
following
may
on
this
same
balcony
where
she
had
spent
so
much
time
in
vague
dreams
she
suddenly
broke
into
tears
she
was
not
in
the
least
but
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
her
anxiety
arose
from
a
vain
expectation
of
a
visit
from
someone
yet
who
was
there
to
come
it
was
very
dark
the
marked
itself
out
like
a
great
black
spot
under
the
sky
filled
with
stars
and
she
could
but
vaguely
distinguish
the
heavy
masses
of
the
old
of
the
bishop
s
garden
and
of
the
park
of
the
hotel
voincourt
alone
the
window
of
the
chapel
sent
out
a
little
light
if
no
one
were
to
come
why
did
her
heart
beat
so
rapidly
it
was
nothing
new
this
feeling
of
waiting
or
of
hope
but
it
was
dated
from
the
long
ago
from
her
early
youth
it
was
like
a
desire
a
looking
forward
for
something
which
had
grown
with
her
growth
and
ended
in
this
feverish
anxiety
of
her
seventeen
years
nothing
would
have
surprised
her
as
for
weeks
she
had
heard
the
sound
of
voices
in
this
mysterious
corner
peopled
by
her
imagination
the
golden
legend
had
left
there
its
supernatural
world
of
saints
and
martyrs
and
the
miracle
was
all
ready
to
appear
there
she
understood
well
that
everything
was
animated
that
the
voices
came
from
objects
hitherto
silent
that
the
leaves
of
the
trees
the
waters
of
the
chevrotte
and
the
stones
of
the
cathedral
spoke
to
her
but
what
was
it
that
all
these
whisperings
from
the
invisible
wished
to
explain
what
did
these
unknown
forces
above
and
around
her
wish
to
do
with
her
as
they
floated
in
the
air
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
darkness
as
if
she
were
at
an
appointed
meeting
with
she
knew
not
whom
and
she
waited
still
waited
until
she
was
overcome
with
sleep
whilst
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
some
supernatural
power
were
deciding
her
destiny
irrespective
of
her
will
or
wish
for
four
evenings
angelique
was
nervous
and
wept
a
great
deal
in
the
darkness
she
remained
in
her
usual
place
and
was
patient
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
envelope
her
and
as
it
increased
in
density
it
oppressed
her
more
and
more
as
if
the
horizon
itself
had
become
smaller
and
was
shutting
her
in
everything
weighed
upon
her
heart
now
there
was
a
dull
murmuring
of
voices
in
her
brain
yet
she
was
not
able
to
hear
them
clearly
or
to
distinguish
their
meaning
it
was
as
if
nature
itself
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
the
earth
with
the
vast
heavens
above
it
had
penetrated
into
her
being
at
the
least
sound
her
hands
burned
and
her
eyes
tried
to
pierce
the
darkness
was
the
wonderful
event
about
to
take
place
the
prodigy
she
awaited
no
there
was
nothing
yet
it
was
probably
merely
the
beating
of
the
wings
of
a
night
bird
and
she
listened
again
attentively
until
she
could
distinguish
the
difference
of
sound
between
the
leaves
of
the
elms
and
the
willows
at
least
twenty
times
she
trembled
violently
when
a
little
stone
rolled
in
the
rivulet
or
a
prowling
animal
jumped
over
the
wall
she
leaned
forward
but
there
was
nothing
still
nothing
at
last
after
some
days
when
at
night
a
warmer
darkness
fell
from
the
sky
where
no
moon
was
visible
a
change
began
she
felt
it
but
it
was
so
slight
so
almost
imperceptible
she
feared
that
she
might
have
been
mistaken
in
the
little
sound
she
heard
which
seemed
unlike
the
usual
noises
she
knew
so
well
she
held
her
breath
as
the
sound
seemed
very
long
in
returning
at
last
it
came
again
louder
than
before
but
equally
confused
she
would
have
said
it
came
from
a
great
distance
that
it
was
a
step
and
that
the
trembling
of
the
air
announced
the
approach
of
something
out
of
sight
and
out
of
hearing
that
which
she
was
expecting
came
slowly
from
the
invisible
slight
movement
of
what
surrounded
her
little
by
little
it
disengaged
itself
from
her
dream
like
a
realisation
of
the
vague
longings
of
her
youth
was
it
the
saint
george
of
the
chapel
window
who
had
come
down
from
his
place
and
was
walking
on
the
grass
in
silence
towards
her
just
then
by
chance
the
was
dimmed
so
that
she
could
not
distinguish
the
faintest
outline
of
the
figures
on
the
painted
glass
but
all
seemed
like
a
blue
cloud
of
vapoury
mist
that
was
all
she
heard
or
learned
at
that
time
of
the
mystery
but
on
the
morrow
at
the
same
hour
by
a
like
obscurity
the
noise
increased
and
approached
a
little
nearer
it
was
certainly
the
sound
of
steps
of
real
steps
which
walked
upon
the
earth
they
would
stop
for
a
moment
then
recommence
here
and
there
moving
up
and
down
without
her
being
able
to
say
precisely
where
they
were
perhaps
they
came
from
the
garden
of
the
voincourts
where
some
night
pedestrian
was
lingering
under
the
trees
or
it
might
be
rather
that
they
were
in
the
tufted
masses
of
the
great
of
the
park
of
the
bishop
whose
strong
perfume
made
her
almost
she
might
do
her
best
to
try
to
penetrate
the
darkness
it
was
only
by
her
hearing
that
she
was
forewarned
of
the
coming
events
aided
a
little
by
her
sense
of
smell
as
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
was
increased
as
if
a
breath
were
mingled
with
it
and
so
for
several
nights
the
steps
resounded
under
the
balcony
and
she
listened
as
they
came
nearer
until
they
reached
the
walls
under
her
feet
there
they
stopped
and
a
long
silence
followed
until
she
seemed
almost
to
lose
consciousness
in
this
slow
embrace
of
something
of
which
she
was
ignorant
not
long
after
she
saw
one
evening
the
little
crescent
of
the
new
moon
appear
among
the
stars
but
it
soon
disappeared
behind
the
brow
of
the
cathedral
like
a
bright
living
eye
that
the
lid
she
followed
it
with
regret
and
at
each
nightfall
she
awaited
its
appearance
watched
its
growth
and
was
impatient
for
this
torch
which
would
ere
long
light
up
the
invisible
in
fact
little
by
little
the
came
out
from
the
obscurity
with
the
ruins
of
its
old
mill
its
clusters
of
trees
and
its
rapid
little
river
and
then
in
the
light
creation
continued
that
which
came
from
a
vision
ended
in
being
embodied
for
at
first
she
only
perceived
that
a
dim
shadow
was
moving
under
the
moonlight
what
was
it
then
a
branch
moved
to
and
fro
by
the
wind
or
was
it
a
large
bat
in
constant
motion
there
were
moments
when
everything
disappeared
and
the
field
slept
in
so
deathly
a
stillness
that
she
thought
her
eyes
had
deceived
her
soon
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
possible
for
a
dark
object
had
certainly
just
crossed
the
open
space
and
had
glided
from
one
to
another
it
appeared
then
disappeared
without
her
being
able
exactly
to
define
it
one
evening
she
thought
she
distinguished
the
dim
outline
of
two
shoulders
and
at
once
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
chapel
window
it
had
a
greyish
tint
as
if
empty
for
the
moon
shining
directly
upon
it
had
deadened
the
light
within
at
that
moment
she
noticed
that
the
living
shadow
grew
larger
as
it
approached
continually
nearer
and
nearer
walking
in
the
grass
at
the
side
of
the
church
in
proportion
as
she
realised
it
was
a
fact
that
someone
was
there
she
was
overcome
by
an
indefinable
sensation
a
nervous
feeling
that
one
has
on
being
looked
at
by
mysterious
unseen
eyes
certainly
someone
was
there
under
the
trees
who
was
regarding
her
fixedly
she
had
on
her
hands
and
face
as
it
were
a
physical
impression
of
those
long
ardent
yet
timid
looks
but
she
did
not
withdraw
herself
from
them
because
she
knew
they
were
pure
and
came
from
the
enchanted
world
of
which
she
had
read
in
the
golden
legend
and
in
the
certainty
of
a
promised
happiness
her
first
anxiety
was
quickly
changed
into
a
delicious
tranquillity
one
night
suddenly
on
the
ground
whitened
by
the
moon
s
rays
the
shadow
designed
itself
plainly
and
clearly
it
was
indeed
that
of
a
man
whom
she
could
not
see
as
he
was
hidden
by
the
willows
as
he
did
not
move
she
was
able
to
look
for
a
long
time
at
his
shadow
from
that
moment
angelique
had
a
secret
her
bare
whitewashed
chamber
was
filled
with
it
she
remained
there
for
hours
lying
on
her
great
bed
where
she
seemed
lost
she
was
so
little
her
eyes
closed
but
not
asleep
and
seeing
continually
before
her
in
her
waking
dreams
this
motionless
shadow
upon
the
earth
when
she
her
eyes
at
dawn
her
looks
wandered
from
the
enormous
wardrobe
to
the
odd
carved
chest
from
the
porcelain
stove
to
the
little
as
if
surprised
at
not
seeing
there
the
mysterious
silhouette
which
she
could
have
so
easily
and
precisely
traced
from
memory
in
her
sleep
she
had
seen
it
gliding
among
the
pale
on
her
curtains
in
her
dreams
as
in
her
waking
hours
her
mind
was
filled
with
it
it
was
a
companion
shadow
to
her
own
she
had
thus
a
double
being
although
she
was
alone
with
her
fancies
this
secret
she
confided
to
no
one
not
even
to
hubertine
to
whom
until
now
she
had
always
told
even
her
thoughts
when
the
latter
surprised
at
her
gaiety
questioned
her
she
blushed
deeply
as
she
replied
that
the
early
spring
had
made
her
very
happy
from
morning
to
evening
she
hummed
little
snatches
of
song
like
a
bee
intoxicated
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
s
rays
never
before
had
the
chasubles
she
embroidered
been
so
resplendent
with
silk
and
gold
the
huberts
smiled
as
they
watched
her
thinking
simply
that
this
exuberance
of
spirits
came
from
her
state
of
perfect
health
as
the
day
waned
she
grew
more
excited
she
sang
at
the
rising
of
the
moon
and
as
soon
as
the
hour
arrived
she
hurried
to
her
balcony
and
waited
for
the
shadow
to
appear
during
all
the
first
quarters
of
the
moon
she
found
it
exact
at
each
rendezvous
erect
and
silent
but
that
was
all
what
was
the
cause
of
it
why
was
it
there
was
it
indeed
only
a
shadow
was
not
it
perhaps
the
saint
who
had
left
his
window
or
the
angel
who
had
formerly
loved
saint
cecilia
and
who
had
now
come
to
love
her
in
her
turn
although
she
was
not
vain
these
thoughts
made
her
proud
and
were
as
sweet
to
her
as
an
invisible
caress
then
she
grew
impatient
to
know
more
and
her
watching
recommenced
the
moon
at
its
full
lighted
up
the
when
it
was
at
its
zenith
the
trees
under
the
white
rays
which
fell
straight
upon
them
in
perpendicular
lines
cast
no
more
shadows
but
were
like
running
fountains
of
silent
brightness
the
whole
garden
was
bathed
and
filled
with
a
luminous
wave
as
limpid
as
crystal
and
the
brilliancy
of
it
was
so
penetrating
that
everything
was
clearly
seen
even
to
the
fine
cutting
of
the
the
slightest
possible
trembling
of
air
seemed
to
wrinkle
this
lake
of
rays
sleeping
in
the
universal
peace
among
the
grand
of
the
neighbouring
garden
and
the
gigantic
brow
of
the
cathedral
two
more
evenings
had
passed
like
this
when
on
the
third
night
as
angelique
was
leaning
on
her
elbows
and
looking
out
her
heart
seemed
to
receive
a
sudden
shock
there
in
the
clear
light
she
saw
him
standing
before
her
and
looking
at
her
his
shadow
like
that
of
the
trees
had
disappeared
under
his
feet
and
he
alone
was
there
distinctly
seen
at
this
distance
she
saw
as
if
it
were
full
day
that
he
was
tall
slight
a
blonde
and
apparently
about
twenty
years
of
age
he
resembled
either
a
saint
george
or
a
superb
picture
of
christ
with
his
curly
hair
his
thin
beard
his
straight
nose
rather
large
and
his
black
eyes
and
she
recognised
him
perfectly
never
had
she
seen
another
like
him
it
was
he
her
hero
and
he
was
exactly
as
she
expected
to
find
him
the
wonder
was
at
last
accomplished
the
slow
creation
of
the
invisible
had
perfected
itself
in
this
living
apparition
and
he
came
out
from
the
unknown
from
the
movement
of
things
from
murmuring
voices
from
the
action
of
the
night
from
all
that
had
enveloped
her
until
she
almost
fainted
into
unconsciousness
she
also
saw
him
as
if
he
were
lifted
above
the
earth
so
supernatural
appeared
to
be
his
coming
whilst
the
miraculous
seemed
to
surround
him
on
every
side
as
it
floated
over
the
mysterious
he
had
as
his
escort
the
entire
people
of
the
legend
the
saints
whose
staffs
blossomed
the
virgins
whose
wounds
shed
milk
and
the
stars
seemed
to
pale
before
this
white
group
of
perfection
angelique
continued
to
look
at
him
he
raised
his
arms
and
held
them
out
wide
open
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
but
smiled
sweetly
chapter
vi
it
was
a
great
affair
for
the
whole
household
when
every
three
months
hubertine
prepared
the
lye
for
the
a
woman
was
hired
to
aid
them
the
mother
gabet
as
she
was
called
and
for
four
days
all
embroidery
was
laid
aside
while
angelique
took
her
part
in
the
unusual
work
making
of
it
a
perfect
amusement
as
she
soaped
and
rinsed
the
clothes
in
the
clean
water
of
the
chevrotte
the
linen
when
taken
from
the
ashes
was
wheeled
to
the
through
the
little
gate
of
communication
in
the
garden
there
the
days
were
spent
in
the
open
air
and
the
sunshine
i
will
do
the
washing
this
time
mother
for
it
is
the
greatest
of
delights
to
and
gaily
laughing
with
her
sleeves
drawn
up
above
her
elbows
flourishing
the
beetle
angelique
struck
the
clothes
most
heartily
in
the
pleasure
of
such
healthy
exercise
it
was
hard
work
but
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
and
only
stopped
occasionally
to
say
a
few
words
or
to
show
her
shiny
face
covered
with
foam
look
mother
this
makes
my
arms
strong
it
does
me
a
world
of
the
chevrotte
crossed
the
field
diagonally
at
first
drowsily
then
its
stream
became
very
rapid
as
it
was
thrown
in
great
bubbles
over
a
pebbly
descent
it
came
from
the
garden
of
the
bishop
through
a
species
of
floodgate
left
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
at
the
other
end
it
disappeared
under
an
arched
vault
at
the
corner
of
the
hotel
voincourt
where
it
was
swallowed
up
in
the
earth
to
reappear
two
hundred
yards
farther
on
as
it
passed
along
the
whole
length
of
the
rue
basse
to
the
ligneul
into
which
it
emptied
itself
therefore
it
was
very
necessary
to
watch
the
linen
constantly
for
run
as
fast
as
possible
every
piece
that
was
once
let
go
was
almost
inevitably
lost
mother
wait
wait
a
little
i
will
put
this
heavy
stone
on
the
napkins
we
shall
then
see
if
the
river
can
carry
them
away
the
little
thief
she
placed
the
stone
firmly
then
returned
to
draw
another
from
the
old
mill
enchanted
to
move
about
and
to
fatigue
herself
and
although
she
severely
bruised
her
finger
she
merely
moistened
it
a
little
saying
oh
that
is
during
the
day
the
poor
people
who
sheltered
themselves
in
the
ruins
went
out
to
ask
for
charity
from
the
on
the
highways
so
the
clos
was
quite
deserted
it
was
a
delicious
fresh
solitude
with
its
clusters
of
willows
its
high
and
especially
its
verdure
its
overflowing
of
wild
herbs
and
grasses
so
high
that
they
came
up
to
one
s
shoulders
a
quivering
silence
came
from
the
two
neighbouring
parks
whose
great
trees
barred
the
horizon
after
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
was
lengthened
out
with
a
calm
sweetness
and
a
perfume
of
evaporated
incense
angelique
continued
to
beat
the
linen
harder
still
with
all
the
force
of
her
white
arms
oh
mother
dear
you
can
have
no
idea
how
hungry
i
shall
be
this
evening
ah
you
know
that
you
have
promised
to
give
me
a
good
on
the
day
of
the
rinsing
angelique
was
quite
alone
the
gabet
suffering
from
a
sudden
severe
attack
of
sciatica
had
not
been
able
to
come
as
usual
and
hubertine
was
kept
at
home
by
other
household
cares
kneeling
in
her
little
box
half
filled
with
straw
the
young
girl
took
the
pieces
one
by
one
shook
them
for
a
long
time
in
the
stream
until
the
water
was
no
longer
dimmed
but
had
become
as
clear
as
crystal
she
did
not
hurry
at
all
for
since
the
morning
she
had
been
tormented
by
a
great
curiosity
having
seen
to
her
astonishment
an
old
workman
in
a
white
blouse
who
was
putting
up
a
light
scaffolding
before
the
window
of
the
chapel
hautecoeur
could
it
be
that
they
were
about
to
repair
the
panes
there
was
it
must
be
confessed
great
need
of
doing
so
several
pieces
were
wanting
in
the
figure
of
saint
george
and
in
other
places
where
in
the
course
of
centuries
panes
that
had
been
broken
had
been
replaced
by
ordinary
glass
still
all
this
was
irritating
to
her
she
was
so
accustomed
to
the
gaps
of
the
saint
who
was
piercing
the
dragon
with
his
sword
and
of
the
royal
princess
as
she
led
the
conquered
beast
along
with
her
scarf
that
she
already
mourned
as
if
one
had
the
intention
of
mutilating
them
it
was
sacrilege
to
think
of
changing
such
old
venerable
things
but
when
she
returned
to
the
field
after
her
lunch
all
her
angry
feelings
passed
away
immediately
for
a
second
workman
was
upon
the
staging
a
young
man
this
time
who
also
wore
a
white
blouse
and
she
recognised
him
it
was
he
her
hero
gaily
without
any
embarrassment
angelique
resumed
her
place
on
her
knees
on
the
straw
of
her
box
then
with
her
wrists
bare
she
put
her
hands
in
the
deep
clear
water
and
recommenced
shaking
the
linen
back
and
forth
yes
it
was
he
tall
slight
a
blonde
with
his
fine
beard
and
his
hair
curled
like
that
of
a
god
his
complexion
as
fresh
as
when
she
had
first
seen
him
under
the
white
shadow
of
the
moonlight
since
it
was
he
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
for
the
window
were
he
to
touch
it
he
would
only
embellish
it
and
it
was
no
disappointment
to
her
whatever
to
find
him
in
this
blouse
a
workman
like
herself
a
painter
on
glass
no
doubt
on
the
contrary
this
fact
made
her
smile
so
absolutely
certain
was
she
of
the
eventual
fulfillment
of
her
dream
of
royal
fortune
now
it
was
simply
an
appearance
a
beginning
what
good
would
it
do
her
to
know
who
he
was
from
whence
he
came
or
whither
he
was
going
some
morning
he
would
prove
to
be
that
which
she
expected
him
to
be
a
shower
of
gold
would
stream
from
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
a
triumphal
march
would
break
forth
in
the
distant
rumblings
of
the
organ
and
all
would
come
true
she
did
not
stay
to
ask
herself
how
he
could
always
be
there
day
and
night
yet
it
was
evident
either
that
he
must
live
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
houses
or
he
must
pass
by
the
lane
des
guerdaches
which
ran
by
the
side
of
the
bishop
s
park
to
the
rue
magloire
then
a
charming
hour
passed
by
she
bent
forward
she
rinsed
her
linen
her
face
almost
touching
the
fresh
water
but
each
time
she
took
a
different
piece
she
raised
her
head
and
cast
towards
the
church
a
look
in
which
from
the
agitation
of
her
heart
was
a
little
malice
and
he
upon
the
scaffolding
with
an
air
of
being
closely
occupied
in
examining
the
state
of
the
window
turned
towards
her
glancing
at
her
sideways
and
evidently
much
disturbed
whenever
she
surprised
him
doing
so
it
was
astonishing
how
quickly
he
blushed
how
dark
red
his
face
became
at
the
slightest
emotion
whether
of
anger
or
interest
all
the
blood
in
his
veins
seemed
to
mount
to
his
face
he
had
flashing
eyes
which
showed
will
yet
he
was
so
diffident
that
when
he
knew
he
was
being
criticised
he
was
embarrassed
as
a
little
child
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
and
stammered
out
his
orders
to
the
old
man
who
accompanied
him
as
for
angelique
that
which
delighted
her
most
as
she
refreshed
her
arms
in
this
turbulent
water
was
to
picture
him
innocent
like
herself
ignorant
of
the
world
and
with
an
equally
intense
desire
to
have
a
taste
of
life
there
was
no
need
of
his
telling
to
others
who
he
was
for
had
not
invisible
messengers
and
unseen
lips
made
known
to
her
that
he
was
to
be
her
own
she
looked
once
more
just
as
he
was
turning
his
head
and
so
the
minutes
passed
and
it
was
delicious
suddenly
she
saw
that
he
jumped
from
the
staging
then
that
he
walked
backwards
quite
a
distance
through
the
grass
as
if
to
take
a
certain
position
from
which
he
could
examine
the
window
more
easily
but
she
could
not
help
smiling
so
evident
was
it
that
he
simply
wished
to
approach
her
he
had
made
a
firm
decision
like
a
man
who
risks
everything
and
now
it
was
touching
as
well
as
comical
to
see
that
he
remained
standing
a
few
steps
from
her
his
back
towards
her
not
daring
to
move
fearing
that
he
had
been
too
hasty
in
coming
as
far
as
he
had
done
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
would
go
back
again
to
the
as
he
had
come
from
it
without
paying
any
attention
to
her
however
becoming
desperate
at
last
he
turned
and
as
at
that
moment
she
was
glancing
in
his
direction
their
eyes
met
and
they
remained
gazing
fixedly
at
each
other
they
were
both
deeply
confused
they
lost
their
and
might
never
have
been
able
to
regain
it
had
not
a
dramatic
incident
aroused
them
oh
dear
oh
dear
exclaimed
the
young
girl
in
distress
in
her
excitement
a
which
she
had
been
rinsing
unconsciously
had
just
escaped
her
and
the
stream
was
fast
bearing
it
away
yet
another
minute
and
it
would
disappear
round
the
corner
of
the
wall
of
the
voincourt
park
under
the
arched
vault
through
which
the
chevrotte
passed
there
were
several
seconds
of
anxious
waiting
he
saw
at
once
what
had
happened
and
rushed
forward
but
the
current
leaping
over
the
pebbles
carried
this
sacque
which
seemed
possessed
as
it
went
along
much
more
rapidly
than
he
he
stooped
thinking
he
had
caught
it
but
took
up
only
a
handful
of
soapy
foam
twice
he
failed
the
third
time
he
almost
fell
then
quite
vexed
with
a
brave
look
as
if
doing
something
at
the
peril
of
his
life
he
went
into
the
water
and
seized
the
garment
just
as
it
was
about
being
drawn
under
the
ground
angelique
who
until
now
had
followed
the
rescue
anxiously
quite
upset
as
if
threatened
by
a
great
misfortune
was
so
relieved
that
she
had
an
intense
desire
to
laugh
this
feeling
was
partly
nervous
it
is
true
but
not
entirely
so
for
was
not
this
the
adventure
of
which
she
had
so
often
dreamed
this
meeting
on
the
border
of
a
lake
the
terrible
danger
from
which
she
was
to
be
saved
by
a
young
man
more
beautiful
than
the
day
saint
george
the
tribune
the
warrior
these
were
simply
united
in
one
and
he
was
this
painter
of
stained
glass
this
young
workman
in
his
white
blouse
when
she
saw
him
coming
back
his
feet
wet
through
and
through
as
he
held
the
dripping
camisole
awkwardly
in
his
hand
realising
the
ridiculous
side
of
the
energy
he
had
employed
in
saving
it
from
the
waves
she
was
obliged
to
bite
her
tongue
to
check
the
outburst
of
gaiety
which
seemed
almost
to
choke
her
he
forgot
himself
as
he
looked
at
her
she
was
like
a
most
adorable
child
in
this
restrained
mirth
with
which
all
her
youth
seemed
to
vibrate
splashed
with
water
her
arms
almost
chilled
by
the
stream
she
seemed
to
send
forth
from
herself
the
purity
and
clearness
of
these
living
springs
which
rushed
from
the
mossy
woods
she
was
an
impersonation
of
health
joy
and
freshness
in
the
full
sunlight
one
could
easily
fancy
that
she
might
be
a
careful
housekeeper
and
a
queen
withal
as
she
was
there
in
her
working
dress
with
her
slender
waist
her
regal
neck
her
oval
face
such
as
one
reads
of
in
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
give
her
back
the
linen
he
found
her
exquisite
so
perfect
a
representation
of
the
beauty
of
the
art
he
loved
it
enraged
him
in
spite
of
himself
that
he
should
have
the
air
of
an
idiot
as
he
plainly
saw
the
effort
she
made
not
to
laugh
but
he
was
forced
to
do
something
so
at
last
he
gave
her
back
the
sacque
then
angelique
realised
that
if
she
were
to
open
her
mouth
and
try
to
thank
him
she
would
shout
poor
fellow
she
sympathised
with
him
and
pitied
him
but
it
was
irresistible
she
was
happy
and
needed
to
give
expression
to
it
she
must
yield
to
the
gaiety
with
which
her
heart
overflowed
it
was
such
lovely
weather
and
all
life
was
so
beautiful
at
last
she
thought
she
might
speak
wishing
simply
to
say
thank
you
but
the
wish
to
laugh
had
returned
and
made
her
stammer
interrupting
her
at
each
word
it
was
a
loud
cheery
laugh
a
sonorous
outpouring
of
pearly
notes
which
sang
sweetly
to
the
crystalline
accompaniment
of
the
chevrotte
the
young
man
was
so
disconcerted
that
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
his
usually
pale
face
had
become
very
red
the
timid
childlike
expression
of
his
eyes
had
changed
into
a
fiery
one
like
that
of
an
eagle
and
he
moved
away
quickly
he
disappeared
with
the
old
workman
and
even
then
she
continued
to
laugh
as
she
bent
over
the
water
again
splashing
herself
as
she
shook
the
clothes
hither
and
thither
rejoicing
in
the
brightness
of
the
happy
day
on
the
morrow
he
came
an
hour
earlier
but
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
linen
which
had
been
dripping
all
night
was
spread
out
on
the
grass
there
was
a
brisk
wind
which
was
excellent
for
drying
but
in
order
that
the
different
articles
need
not
be
blown
away
they
were
kept
in
place
by
putting
little
pebbles
on
their
four
corners
the
whole
wash
was
there
looking
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
among
the
green
herbage
having
a
strong
odour
of
plants
about
it
and
making
the
meadow
as
if
it
had
suddenly
blossomed
out
into
a
snowy
covering
of
daisies
when
angelique
came
to
look
at
it
after
breakfast
she
was
distressed
for
so
strong
had
become
the
gusts
of
wind
that
all
threatened
to
be
carried
away
already
a
sheet
had
started
and
several
napkins
had
gone
to
fasten
themselves
to
the
branches
of
a
willow
she
fortunately
caught
them
but
then
the
handkerchiefs
began
to
fly
there
was
no
one
to
help
her
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
lost
all
her
presence
of
mind
when
she
tried
to
spread
out
the
sheet
again
she
had
a
regular
battle
for
she
was
quite
lost
in
it
as
it
covered
her
with
a
great
crackling
sound
through
all
the
noise
of
the
wind
she
heard
a
voice
saying
mademoiselle
do
you
wish
me
to
help
you
it
was
he
and
immediately
she
cried
to
him
with
no
other
thought
than
her
as
a
good
housewife
of
course
i
wish
it
come
and
help
me
then
take
the
end
over
there
nearest
to
you
hold
it
firm
the
sheet
which
they
stretched
out
with
their
strong
arms
flapped
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
sail
at
last
they
succeeded
in
putting
it
on
the
ground
and
then
placed
upon
it
much
heavier
stones
than
before
and
now
that
quite
conquered
it
sank
quietly
down
neither
of
them
thought
of
leaving
their
places
but
remained
on
their
knees
at
the
opposite
corners
separated
by
this
great
piece
of
pure
white
linen
she
smiled
but
this
time
without
malice
it
was
a
silent
message
of
thanks
he
became
by
degrees
a
little
bolder
my
name
is
and
mine
is
i
am
a
painter
on
glass
and
have
been
charged
to
repair
the
window
of
the
chapel
i
live
over
there
with
my
father
and
mother
and
i
am
an
embroiderer
of
church
the
wind
which
continued
to
be
strong
under
the
clear
blue
sky
carried
away
their
words
lashed
them
with
its
purifying
breath
in
the
midst
of
the
warm
sunshine
in
which
they
were
bathed
they
spoke
of
things
which
they
already
knew
as
if
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
is
the
window
then
to
be
replaced
no
oh
no
it
will
be
so
well
repaired
that
the
new
part
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
old
i
love
it
quite
as
much
as
you
oh
it
is
indeed
true
that
i
love
it
i
have
already
embroidered
a
saint
george
but
it
was
not
so
beautiful
as
this
oh
not
so
beautiful
how
can
you
say
that
i
have
seen
it
if
it
is
the
saint
george
on
the
chasuble
which
the
abbot
cornille
wore
last
sunday
it
is
a
marvellous
she
blushed
with
pleasure
but
quickly
turned
the
conversation
as
she
exclaimed
hurry
and
put
another
stone
on
the
left
corner
of
the
sheet
or
the
wind
will
carry
it
away
from
us
he
made
all
possible
haste
weighed
down
the
linen
which
had
been
in
great
commotion
like
the
wings
of
a
great
wounded
bird
trying
its
best
to
fly
away
finding
that
this
time
it
would
probably
keep
its
place
the
two
young
people
rose
up
and
now
angelique
went
through
the
narrow
green
paths
between
the
pieces
of
linen
glancing
at
each
one
while
he
followed
her
with
an
equally
busy
look
as
if
preoccupied
by
the
possible
loss
of
a
or
an
apron
all
this
seemed
quite
natural
to
them
both
so
she
continued
to
chatter
away
freely
and
artlessly
as
she
told
of
her
daily
life
and
explained
her
tastes
for
my
part
i
always
wish
that
everything
should
be
in
its
place
in
the
morning
i
am
always
awakened
at
the
same
hour
by
the
striking
of
the
in
the
workroom
and
whether
it
is
scarcely
daylight
or
not
i
dress
myself
as
quickly
as
possible
my
shoes
and
stockings
are
here
my
soap
and
all
articles
of
toilette
there
a
true
mania
for
order
yet
you
may
well
believe
that
i
was
not
born
so
oh
no
on
the
contrary
i
was
the
most
careless
person
possible
mother
was
obliged
to
repeat
to
me
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
that
i
might
not
leave
my
things
in
every
corner
of
the
house
for
i
found
it
easier
to
scatter
them
about
and
now
when
i
am
at
work
from
morning
to
evening
i
can
never
do
anything
right
if
my
chair
is
not
in
the
same
place
directly
opposite
the
light
fortunately
i
am
neither
right
nor
left
handed
but
can
use
both
hands
equally
well
at
embroidering
which
is
a
great
help
to
me
for
it
is
not
everyone
who
can
do
that
then
i
adore
flowers
but
i
can
not
keep
a
bouquet
near
me
without
having
a
terrible
headache
violets
alone
i
can
bear
and
that
is
surprising
but
their
odour
seems
to
calm
me
and
at
the
least
indisposition
i
have
only
need
to
smell
them
and
i
am
at
once
he
was
enraptured
while
listening
to
her
prattle
he
revelled
in
the
beautiful
ring
of
her
voice
which
had
an
extremely
penetrating
prolonged
charm
and
he
must
have
been
peculiarly
sensitive
to
this
human
music
for
the
caressing
inflection
on
certain
words
moistened
his
eyelids
suddenly
returning
to
her
household
cares
she
exclaimed
oh
now
the
shirts
will
soon
be
dry
then
in
the
unconscious
and
simple
need
of
making
herself
known
she
continued
her
confidences
for
colouring
the
white
is
always
beautiful
is
it
not
i
tire
at
times
of
blue
of
red
and
of
all
other
shades
but
white
is
a
constant
joy
of
which
i
am
never
weary
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
trouble
you
on
the
contrary
you
would
like
to
lose
yourself
in
it
we
had
a
white
cat
with
yellow
spots
which
i
painted
white
it
did
very
well
for
a
while
but
it
did
not
last
long
listen
a
minute
mother
does
not
know
it
but
i
keep
all
the
waste
bits
of
white
silk
and
have
a
drawer
full
of
them
for
just
nothing
except
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
them
and
smoothing
them
over
from
time
to
time
and
i
have
another
secret
but
this
is
a
very
serious
one
when
i
wake
up
there
is
every
morning
near
my
bed
a
great
white
object
which
gently
flies
he
did
not
smile
but
appeared
firmly
to
believe
her
was
not
all
she
said
in
her
simple
way
quite
natural
a
queen
in
the
magnificence
of
her
courtly
surroundings
could
not
have
conquered
him
so
quickly
she
had
in
the
midst
of
this
white
linen
on
the
green
grass
a
charming
grand
air
happy
and
supreme
which
touched
him
to
the
heart
with
an
power
he
was
completely
subdued
she
was
everything
to
him
from
this
moment
he
would
follow
her
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
in
the
worship
of
her
light
feet
her
delicate
hands
of
her
whole
being
adorable
and
perfect
as
a
dream
she
continued
to
walk
before
him
with
a
short
quick
step
and
he
followed
her
closely
suffocated
by
a
thought
of
the
happiness
he
scarcely
dared
hope
might
come
to
him
but
another
sudden
gust
of
wind
came
up
and
there
was
a
perfect
flight
into
the
distance
of
cambric
collars
and
cuffs
of
neckerchiefs
and
chemisettes
of
muslin
which
as
they
disappeared
seemed
like
a
flock
of
white
birds
knocked
about
by
the
tempest
angelique
began
to
run
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
you
will
have
to
come
again
and
help
me
oh
dear
they
both
rushed
forward
she
caught
a
kerchief
on
the
borders
of
the
chevrotte
he
had
already
saved
two
chemisettes
which
he
found
in
the
midst
of
some
high
thistles
one
by
one
the
cuffs
and
the
collars
were
retaken
but
in
the
course
of
their
running
at
full
speed
the
flying
folds
of
her
skirt
had
at
several
different
times
brushed
against
him
and
each
time
his
face
became
suddenly
red
and
his
heart
beat
violently
in
his
turn
he
touched
her
face
accidentally
as
she
jumped
to
recover
the
last
fichu
which
he
had
carelessly
let
go
of
she
was
startled
and
stood
quietly
but
breathing
more
quickly
she
joked
no
longer
her
laugh
sounded
less
clear
and
she
was
not
tempted
to
ridicule
this
great
awkward
but
most
attractive
fellow
the
feminine
nature
so
recently
awakened
in
her
softened
her
almost
to
tears
and
with
the
feeling
of
inexplicable
tenderness
which
overpowered
her
was
mingled
a
what
was
the
matter
with
her
that
she
was
less
gay
and
that
she
was
so
overcome
by
this
delicious
pang
when
he
held
out
the
kerchief
to
her
their
hands
by
chance
touched
for
a
moment
they
trembled
as
they
looked
at
each
other
inquiringly
then
she
drew
back
quickly
and
for
several
seconds
seemed
not
to
know
what
she
should
do
under
the
extraordinary
circumstances
which
had
just
occurred
at
last
she
started
gathering
up
all
the
smaller
articles
of
linen
in
her
arms
and
leaving
the
rest
she
turned
towards
her
home
felicien
then
wished
to
speak
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
pray
you
to
but
the
wind
which
had
greatly
increased
cut
off
his
words
in
despair
he
looked
at
her
as
she
flew
along
as
if
carried
away
by
the
blast
she
ran
and
ran
in
and
out
among
the
white
sheets
and
tablecloths
under
the
oblique
pale
golden
rays
of
the
sun
already
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
seemed
to
envelop
her
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
entering
her
own
garden
by
the
little
gate
which
separated
it
from
the
clos
without
having
once
glanced
behind
her
but
on
the
threshold
she
turned
quickly
as
if
seized
with
a
kind
impulse
not
wishing
that
he
should
think
she
was
angry
and
confused
but
smiling
she
called
out
thank
you
thank
you
very
did
she
wish
to
say
that
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
having
helped
her
in
recovering
the
linen
or
was
it
for
something
else
she
disappeared
and
the
gate
was
shut
after
her
and
he
remained
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
field
under
the
great
regular
gusts
which
continued
to
rage
although
the
sky
was
still
clear
and
pure
the
elms
in
the
bishop
s
garden
rustled
with
a
long
billowy
sound
and
a
loud
voice
seemed
to
clamour
through
the
terraces
and
the
flying
buttresses
of
the
cathedral
but
he
heard
only
the
light
flapping
of
a
little
morning
cap
tied
to
a
branch
of
a
lilac
bush
as
if
it
were
a
bouquet
and
which
belonged
to
her
from
that
date
each
time
that
angelique
opened
her
window
she
saw
felicien
over
there
in
the
he
passed
days
in
the
field
having
the
chapel
window
as
an
excuse
for
doing
so
on
which
however
the
work
did
not
advance
the
least
in
the
world
for
hours
he
would
forget
himself
behind
a
cluster
of
bushes
where
stretched
out
on
the
grass
he
watched
through
the
leaves
and
it
was
the
greatest
of
pleasures
to
smile
at
each
other
every
morning
and
evening
she
was
so
happy
that
she
asked
for
nothing
more
there
would
not
be
another
general
washing
for
three
months
so
until
then
the
little
would
seldom
be
open
but
three
months
would
pass
very
quickly
and
if
they
could
see
each
other
daily
was
not
that
bliss
enough
what
indeed
could
be
more
charming
than
to
live
in
this
way
thinking
during
the
day
of
the
evening
look
and
during
the
night
of
the
glance
of
the
early
morrow
she
existed
only
in
the
hope
of
that
desired
moment
its
joy
filled
her
life
moreover
what
good
would
there
be
in
approaching
each
other
and
in
talking
together
were
they
not
constantly
becoming
better
acquainted
without
meeting
although
at
a
distance
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
each
penetrated
into
the
other
s
innermost
thoughts
with
the
closest
intimacy
at
last
they
became
so
filled
one
with
the
other
that
they
could
not
close
their
eyes
without
seeing
before
them
with
an
astonishing
clearness
of
detail
the
image
of
their
new
friend
so
in
reality
they
were
never
separated
it
was
a
constant
surprise
to
angelique
that
she
had
unbosomed
herself
at
once
to
felicien
at
their
first
meeting
she
had
confided
in
him
had
told
him
everything
about
her
habits
her
tastes
and
the
deepest
secrets
of
her
heart
he
more
silent
was
called
felicien
and
that
was
all
she
knew
perhaps
it
was
quite
right
that
it
should
be
so
the
woman
giving
everything
and
the
man
holding
himself
back
as
a
stranger
she
had
no
premature
curiosity
she
continued
to
smile
at
the
thought
of
things
which
would
certainly
be
realised
so
for
her
that
of
which
she
was
ignorant
counted
for
nothing
the
only
important
fact
in
her
mind
was
the
intimacy
between
them
which
united
them
little
by
little
apart
from
the
world
she
knew
nothing
about
him
yet
she
was
so
well
acquainted
with
his
nature
that
she
could
read
his
thoughts
in
a
simple
look
or
smile
he
her
hero
had
come
as
she
always
said
he
would
she
had
at
once
recognised
him
and
they
loved
each
other
so
they
enjoyed
most
thoroughly
this
true
possession
from
a
distance
they
were
certainly
encouraged
by
the
new
discoveries
they
made
she
had
long
slender
hands
roughened
a
little
at
the
ends
of
the
fingers
by
her
constant
use
of
the
needle
but
he
adored
them
she
noticed
that
his
feet
were
small
and
was
proud
of
the
fact
everything
about
him
flattered
her
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
being
so
handsome
and
she
was
overcome
with
joy
the
evening
that
she
found
his
beard
to
be
of
a
lighter
shade
than
his
hair
which
fact
gave
a
greater
softness
to
his
smile
he
went
away
transported
when
one
morning
as
she
leaned
over
the
balcony
he
saw
a
little
red
spot
on
her
pretty
neck
their
hearts
being
thus
laid
open
new
treasures
were
daily
found
certainly
the
proud
and
frank
manner
in
which
she
opened
her
window
showed
that
even
in
her
ignorance
as
a
little
embroiderer
she
had
the
royal
bearing
of
a
princess
in
the
same
way
she
knew
that
he
was
good
from
seeing
how
lightly
he
walked
over
the
herbs
and
the
grass
around
them
was
a
radiance
of
virtues
and
graces
from
the
first
hour
of
their
meeting
each
interview
had
its
special
charm
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
their
felicity
in
seeing
each
other
could
never
be
exhausted
nevertheless
felicien
soon
showed
certain
signs
of
impatience
and
he
no
longer
remained
for
hours
concealed
behind
a
bush
in
the
immobility
of
an
absolute
happiness
as
soon
as
angelique
appeared
at
her
window
he
was
restless
and
tried
to
approach
her
as
he
glided
from
willow
to
willow
at
length
she
was
a
little
disturbed
fearing
that
someone
might
see
him
one
day
there
was
almost
a
quarrel
for
he
came
even
to
the
wall
of
the
house
so
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
balcony
it
was
a
great
shock
to
him
that
she
should
be
offended
and
he
showed
in
the
expression
of
his
face
so
mute
a
prayer
of
submission
that
the
next
day
she
pardoned
him
and
opened
her
window
at
the
usual
hour
but
although
expectation
was
delightful
it
was
not
sufficient
for
him
and
he
began
again
now
he
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once
he
filled
the
with
his
restlessness
he
came
out
from
behind
every
tree
he
appeared
above
every
bunch
of
brambles
like
the
of
the
great
elms
in
the
bishop
s
garden
he
seemed
to
have
his
habitation
between
two
branches
in
the
environs
the
chevrotte
was
an
excuse
for
his
passing
entire
days
there
on
its
willowy
banks
bending
over
the
stream
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
watching
the
floating
of
the
clouds
one
day
she
saw
that
he
had
climbed
up
on
the
ruins
of
the
old
mill
and
was
standing
on
the
framework
of
a
shed
looking
happy
to
have
thus
approached
her
a
little
in
his
regret
at
not
being
able
to
fly
even
so
far
as
her
shoulder
another
day
she
stifled
a
slight
scream
as
she
saw
him
far
above
her
leaning
on
an
ornamented
balustrade
of
the
cathedral
on
the
roof
of
the
chapels
of
the
choir
which
formed
a
terrace
in
what
way
could
he
have
reached
this
gallery
the
door
of
which
was
always
fastened
and
whose
key
no
one
had
a
right
to
touch
but
the
beadle
then
again
a
little
later
on
how
was
it
that
she
should
find
him
up
in
the
air
among
the
flying
buttresses
of
the
nave
and
the
pinnacles
of
the
piers
from
these
heights
he
could
look
into
every
part
of
her
chamber
as
the
swallows
who
flying
from
point
to
point
among
the
spires
saw
everything
that
was
therein
without
her
having
the
idea
of
hiding
herself
from
them
but
a
human
eye
was
different
and
from
that
day
she
shut
herself
up
more
and
an
trouble
came
to
her
at
the
thought
that
her
privacy
was
being
intruded
upon
and
that
she
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
atmosphere
of
adoration
that
surrounded
her
if
she
were
really
not
impatient
why
was
it
that
her
heart
beat
so
strongly
like
the
bell
of
the
on
great
festivals
three
days
passed
without
angelique
showing
herself
so
alarmed
was
she
by
the
increasing
boldness
of
felicien
she
vowed
in
her
mind
that
she
would
never
see
him
again
and
wound
herself
up
to
such
a
degree
of
resentment
that
she
thought
she
hated
him
but
he
had
given
her
his
feverishness
she
could
not
keep
still
and
the
slightest
pretext
was
enough
for
an
excuse
to
leave
the
chasuble
upon
which
she
was
at
work
so
having
heard
that
gabet
was
ill
in
bed
in
the
most
profound
poverty
she
went
to
see
her
every
morning
her
room
was
on
the
rue
des
orfevres
only
three
doors
away
from
the
huberts
she
would
take
her
tea
sugar
and
soup
then
when
necessary
go
to
buy
her
medicine
at
the
druggist
s
on
the
grand
rue
one
day
as
she
returned
with
her
hands
full
of
the
little
phials
she
started
at
seeing
felicien
at
the
bedside
of
the
old
sick
woman
he
turned
very
red
and
slipped
away
awkwardly
after
leaving
a
charitable
offering
the
next
day
he
came
in
as
she
was
leaving
and
she
gave
him
her
place
very
much
displeased
did
he
really
intend
to
prevent
her
from
visiting
the
poor
in
fact
she
had
been
taken
with
one
of
her
fits
of
charity
which
made
her
give
all
she
owned
that
she
might
overwhelm
those
who
had
nothing
at
the
idea
of
suffering
her
whole
soul
melted
into
a
pitiful
fraternity
she
went
often
to
the
mascart
s
a
blind
paralytic
on
the
rue
basse
whom
she
was
obliged
to
feed
herself
the
broth
she
carried
him
then
to
the
chouteaux
a
man
and
his
wife
each
one
over
ninety
years
of
age
who
lived
in
a
little
hut
on
the
rue
magloire
which
she
had
furnished
for
them
with
articles
taken
from
the
attic
of
her
parents
then
there
were
others
and
others
still
whom
she
saw
among
the
wretched
populace
of
the
quarter
and
whom
she
helped
to
support
from
things
that
were
about
her
happy
in
being
able
to
surprise
them
and
to
see
them
brighten
up
for
a
little
while
but
now
strange
to
say
wherever
she
went
she
encountered
felicien
never
before
had
she
seen
so
much
of
him
she
who
had
avoided
going
to
her
window
for
fear
that
he
might
be
near
her
trouble
increased
and
at
last
she
was
very
angry
but
the
worst
of
all
in
this
matter
was
that
angelique
soon
despaired
of
her
charity
this
young
man
spoilt
all
her
pleasure
of
giving
in
other
days
he
might
perhaps
have
been
equally
generous
but
it
was
not
among
the
same
people
not
her
own
particular
poor
of
that
she
was
sure
and
he
must
have
watched
her
and
followed
her
very
closely
to
know
them
all
and
to
take
them
so
regularly
one
after
the
other
now
go
when
she
might
with
a
little
basket
of
provisions
to
the
chouteaux
there
was
always
money
on
the
table
one
day
when
she
went
to
mascart
who
was
constantly
complaining
that
he
had
no
tobacco
she
found
him
very
rich
with
a
shining
new
louis
d
or
on
his
table
strangest
of
all
once
when
visiting
gabet
the
latter
gave
her
a
hundred
franc
note
to
change
and
with
it
she
was
enabled
to
buy
some
medicines
of
which
the
poor
woman
had
long
been
in
need
but
which
she
never
hoped
to
obtain
for
where
could
she
find
money
to
pay
for
them
angelique
herself
could
not
distribute
much
money
as
she
had
none
it
was
to
her
to
realise
her
powerlessness
when
he
could
so
easily
empty
his
purse
she
was
of
course
happy
that
such
a
windfall
had
come
to
the
poor
but
she
felt
as
if
she
were
greatly
diminished
in
her
former
she
no
longer
had
the
same
happiness
in
giving
but
was
disturbed
and
sad
that
she
had
so
little
to
distribute
while
he
had
so
much
the
young
man
not
understanding
her
feelings
thinking
to
conquer
her
esteem
by
an
increase
of
gifts
redoubled
his
charity
and
thus
daily
made
hers
seem
less
was
not
it
exasperating
to
run
against
this
fellow
everywhere
to
see
him
give
an
ox
wherever
she
offered
an
egg
in
addition
to
all
this
she
was
obliged
to
hear
his
praises
sung
by
all
the
needy
whom
he
visited
a
young
man
so
good
so
kind
and
so
well
brought
she
was
a
mere
nothing
now
they
talked
only
of
him
spreading
out
his
gifts
as
if
to
shame
hers
notwithstanding
her
firm
determination
to
forget
him
she
could
not
refrain
from
questioning
them
about
him
what
had
he
left
what
had
he
said
he
was
very
handsome
was
he
not
tender
and
diffident
as
a
woman
perhaps
he
might
even
have
spoken
of
her
ah
yes
indeed
that
was
true
for
he
always
talked
of
her
then
she
was
very
angry
yes
she
certainly
hated
him
for
at
last
she
realised
that
he
weighed
on
her
breast
too
heavily
but
matters
could
not
continue
in
this
way
for
ever
a
change
must
take
place
and
one
may
evening
at
a
wondrously
beautiful
nightfall
it
came
it
was
at
the
home
of
the
lemballeuse
the
family
who
lived
in
the
ruins
of
the
mill
there
were
only
women
there
the
old
grandmother
seamed
with
wrinkles
but
still
active
her
daughter
and
her
grandchildren
of
the
latter
tiennette
the
elder
was
a
large
girl
twenty
years
of
age
and
her
two
little
sisters
rose
and
jeanne
had
already
bold
fearless
eyes
under
their
unkempt
mops
of
red
hair
they
all
begged
during
the
day
on
the
highway
and
along
the
moat
coming
back
at
night
their
feet
worn
out
from
fatigue
in
their
old
shoes
fastened
with
bits
of
string
indeed
that
very
evening
tiennette
had
been
obliged
to
leave
hers
among
the
stones
and
had
returned
wounded
and
with
bleeding
ankles
seated
before
their
door
in
the
midst
of
the
high
grass
of
the
she
drew
out
the
thorns
from
her
flesh
whilst
her
mother
and
the
two
children
surrounded
her
and
uttered
lamentations
just
then
angelique
arrived
hiding
under
her
apron
the
bread
which
she
had
brought
them
as
she
did
once
every
week
she
had
entered
the
field
by
the
little
which
she
had
left
open
behind
her
as
she
intended
to
go
back
as
quickly
as
possible
but
she
stopped
on
seeing
all
the
family
in
tears
what
is
the
matter
why
are
you
in
such
distress
ah
my
good
lady
whined
the
mother
lemballeuse
do
not
you
see
in
what
a
terrible
state
this
great
foolish
girl
has
put
herself
she
will
not
be
able
to
walk
so
that
will
be
a
whole
day
lost
she
must
have
some
shoes
rose
and
jeanne
with
their
eyes
snapping
from
under
their
tangled
hair
redoubled
their
sobs
as
they
cried
out
loudly
yes
yes
she
must
have
some
shoes
she
must
have
some
shoes
tiennette
half
lifting
up
her
thin
dark
face
looked
round
furtively
then
fiercely
without
a
word
she
made
one
of
her
feet
bleed
still
more
maddened
over
a
long
splinter
which
she
had
just
drawn
out
by
the
aid
of
a
pin
and
which
must
have
pained
her
intensely
angelique
quite
touched
by
the
scene
offered
her
the
gift
see
here
at
least
is
some
oh
bread
said
the
mother
no
doubt
it
is
necessary
to
eat
but
it
is
not
with
bread
that
she
will
be
able
to
walk
again
of
that
i
am
certain
and
we
were
to
go
to
the
fair
at
bligny
a
fair
where
every
year
she
makes
at
least
two
francs
oh
good
heavens
what
will
become
of
us
if
she
can
not
go
there
pity
and
embarrassment
rendered
angelique
mute
she
had
exactly
five
sous
in
her
pocket
it
surely
was
not
with
five
sous
that
one
could
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
even
at
an
auction
sale
as
it
had
often
done
before
her
want
of
money
now
paralysed
her
and
that
which
exasperated
her
still
more
and
made
her
lose
her
was
that
at
this
moment
as
she
looked
behind
her
she
saw
felicien
standing
a
few
feet
from
her
in
the
darkening
shadow
without
doubt
he
had
heard
all
that
had
been
said
perhaps
even
he
had
been
there
for
a
great
while
for
he
always
appeared
to
her
in
this
way
when
least
expected
without
her
ever
knowing
whence
he
came
or
whither
he
was
going
she
thought
to
herself
he
will
give
the
indeed
he
had
already
come
forward
the
first
stars
were
appearing
in
the
pale
sky
a
sweet
gentle
quiet
seemed
to
fall
down
from
on
high
soothing
to
sleep
the
whose
willows
were
lost
in
the
dusk
the
cathedral
itself
was
only
a
great
black
bar
in
the
west
yes
certainly
now
he
will
offer
to
give
the
and
at
this
probability
she
was
really
quite
discouraged
was
he
always
then
to
give
everything
could
she
never
even
once
conquer
him
never
her
heart
beat
so
rapidly
that
it
pained
her
she
wished
that
she
might
be
very
rich
to
show
him
that
she
too
could
make
others
happy
but
the
lemballeuse
had
seen
the
good
gentleman
the
mother
had
rushed
forward
the
two
little
sisters
moaned
as
they
held
out
their
hands
for
alms
whilst
the
elder
one
letting
go
of
her
wounded
ankles
looked
at
the
inquiringly
with
her
wild
eyes
listen
my
noisy
children
said
felicien
then
addressing
the
mother
he
continued
you
may
go
to
the
grand
rue
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
basse
angelique
had
understood
immediately
for
the
shoemaker
had
his
shop
there
she
interrupted
him
quickly
and
was
so
agitated
that
she
stammered
her
words
at
random
but
that
is
a
useless
thing
to
do
what
would
be
the
good
of
it
it
is
much
more
simple
yet
she
could
not
find
in
her
own
mind
the
more
simple
thing
she
desired
what
could
she
do
what
could
she
invent
so
to
be
before
him
in
giving
her
charity
never
had
it
seemed
to
her
possible
she
could
detest
him
as
she
did
now
you
will
say
from
me
that
it
is
i
who
have
sent
you
continued
felicien
you
will
ask
again
she
interrupted
him
the
contest
lasted
a
moment
longer
she
repeated
in
an
anxious
way
it
is
indeed
much
more
simple
it
is
much
easier
suddenly
she
was
calm
she
seated
herself
upon
a
stone
thoughtfully
examined
her
shoes
took
them
off
and
then
drew
off
her
stockings
saying
look
this
is
the
best
thing
to
do
after
all
why
should
you
have
any
trouble
about
the
matter
oh
my
good
young
lady
god
will
reward
you
exclaimed
the
mother
lemballeuse
as
she
turned
over
the
shoes
and
found
they
were
not
only
excellent
and
strong
but
almost
new
i
will
cut
them
a
trifle
on
the
top
to
make
them
a
little
larger
tiennette
why
do
you
not
thank
her
stupid
creature
tiennette
snatched
from
the
hands
of
rose
and
jeanne
the
stockings
they
were
coveting
she
did
not
open
her
lips
she
only
gave
one
long
fixed
hard
look
but
now
angelique
realised
that
her
feet
were
bare
and
that
felicien
saw
them
she
blushed
deeply
and
knew
not
what
to
do
she
dared
not
move
for
were
she
to
rise
to
get
up
he
would
only
see
them
all
the
more
then
frightened
she
rose
quickly
and
without
realising
what
she
was
doing
began
to
run
in
the
grass
her
flying
feet
were
very
white
and
small
the
darkness
of
the
evening
had
increased
and
the
was
a
lake
of
shadow
between
the
great
trees
on
one
side
and
the
cathedral
on
the
other
and
on
the
ground
the
only
visible
light
came
from
those
same
little
feet
white
and
satiny
as
the
wing
of
a
dove
startled
and
afraid
of
the
water
angelique
followed
the
bank
of
the
chevrotte
that
she
might
cross
it
on
a
plank
which
served
as
a
bridge
but
felicien
had
gone
a
shorter
way
through
the
brambles
and
brushwood
until
now
he
had
always
been
overcome
by
his
timidity
and
he
had
turned
redder
than
she
as
he
saw
her
bare
feet
pure
and
chaste
as
herself
now
in
the
overflow
of
his
ignorant
youth
passionately
fond
of
beauty
and
desirous
for
love
he
was
impatient
to
cry
out
and
tell
her
of
the
feeling
which
had
entirely
taken
possession
of
him
since
he
had
first
seen
her
but
yet
when
she
brushed
by
him
in
her
flight
he
could
only
stammer
with
a
trembling
voice
the
acknowledgment
so
long
delayed
and
which
burnt
his
lips
i
love
she
stopped
in
surprise
for
an
instant
she
stood
still
and
slightly
trembling
looked
at
him
her
anger
and
the
hate
she
thought
she
had
for
him
all
vanished
at
once
and
melted
into
a
most
delicious
sentiment
of
astonishment
what
had
he
said
what
was
the
word
he
had
just
pronounced
that
she
should
be
so
overcome
by
it
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
yet
when
he
said
so
the
sound
of
it
in
her
ear
overwhelmed
her
with
an
inexplicable
joy
it
resounded
so
deeply
through
her
whole
being
that
her
fears
came
back
and
were
enlarged
she
never
would
dare
reply
to
him
it
was
really
more
than
she
could
bear
she
was
oppressed
he
grown
more
bold
his
heart
touched
and
drawn
nearer
to
hers
by
their
united
deeds
of
charity
repeated
i
love
and
she
fearing
the
lover
began
to
run
that
was
surely
the
only
way
to
escape
such
a
danger
yet
it
was
also
a
happiness
it
was
all
so
strange
the
chevrotte
was
gaily
singing
and
she
plunged
into
it
like
a
startled
fawn
among
its
pebbles
her
feet
still
ran
on
under
the
chill
of
icy
water
the
was
at
last
reached
it
closed
and
she
disappeared
chapter
vii
for
two
days
angelique
was
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
she
sobbed
as
if
she
had
done
something
wrong
and
this
question
which
she
could
not
answer
came
constantly
to
her
mind
had
she
sinned
in
listening
to
this
young
man
was
she
lost
like
the
dreadful
women
in
the
legend
who
having
been
tempted
had
yielded
to
the
devil
was
life
as
it
was
centuries
ago
the
words
so
softly
uttered
i
love
you
still
resounded
with
such
a
tumult
in
her
ears
and
she
was
confused
yet
pleased
by
them
to
such
a
degree
that
they
must
certainly
have
come
from
some
terrible
power
hidden
in
the
depth
of
the
invisible
but
she
knew
not
in
fact
how
could
she
have
known
anything
in
the
ignorance
and
solitude
in
which
she
had
grown
up
her
anguish
was
redoubled
by
this
mysterious
and
inexplicable
struggle
within
her
had
she
sinned
in
making
the
acquaintance
of
felicien
and
then
in
keeping
it
a
secret
she
recalled
to
her
mind
one
by
one
all
the
details
of
her
daily
experience
during
the
past
few
weeks
she
argued
with
her
innocent
scruples
what
was
sin
in
short
was
it
simply
to
meet
to
talk
and
afterwards
to
tell
a
falsehood
to
one
s
parents
but
that
could
not
be
the
extent
of
the
evil
then
why
was
she
so
oppressed
why
if
not
guilty
did
she
suddenly
seem
to
have
become
quite
another
person
as
agitated
as
if
a
new
soul
had
been
given
her
perhaps
it
was
sin
that
had
made
her
so
weak
and
uncomfortable
her
heart
was
full
of
vague
undefined
longings
so
strange
a
medley
of
words
and
also
of
acts
in
the
future
that
she
was
frightened
by
them
without
in
the
least
understanding
them
the
blood
mounted
to
her
face
and
exquisitely
coloured
her
cheeks
as
she
heard
again
the
sweet
yet
appalling
words
i
love
you
and
she
reasoned
no
longer
but
sobbed
again
doubting
evident
facts
fearing
the
commission
of
a
fault
in
the
beyond
in
that
which
had
neither
name
nor
form
but
that
which
especially
distressed
her
now
was
that
she
had
not
made
a
of
hubertine
could
she
only
have
asked
her
what
she
wished
to
know
no
doubt
the
latter
with
a
word
would
have
explained
the
whole
mystery
to
her
then
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
mere
fact
of
speaking
to
someone
of
her
trouble
would
have
cured
her
but
the
secret
had
become
too
weighty
to
reveal
it
would
be
more
than
she
could
bear
for
the
shame
would
be
too
great
she
became
quite
artful
for
the
moment
affected
an
air
of
calmness
when
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
a
tempest
was
raging
if
asked
why
she
was
so
she
lifted
her
eyes
with
a
look
of
surprise
as
she
replied
that
she
was
thinking
of
something
seated
before
the
her
hands
mechanically
drawing
the
needle
back
and
forth
very
quiet
to
all
outward
appearance
she
was
from
morning
till
evening
distracted
by
one
thought
to
be
loved
to
be
loved
and
for
herself
on
her
side
was
she
in
love
this
was
still
an
obscure
question
to
which
in
her
inexperience
she
found
no
answer
she
repeated
it
so
constantly
that
at
last
it
made
her
giddy
the
words
lost
all
their
usual
meaning
and
everything
seemed
to
be
in
a
whirl
which
carried
her
away
with
an
effort
she
recovered
herself
and
realised
that
with
needle
in
hand
she
was
still
embroidering
with
her
accustomed
application
although
mechanically
as
if
in
a
perhaps
these
strange
symptoms
were
a
sign
that
she
was
about
to
have
a
severe
illness
one
evening
she
had
such
an
attack
of
shivering
when
she
went
to
bed
that
she
thought
she
would
never
be
able
to
recover
from
it
that
idea
was
at
the
same
time
both
cruel
and
sweet
she
suffered
from
it
as
if
it
were
too
great
a
joy
even
the
next
day
her
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
break
and
her
ears
were
filled
with
a
singing
sound
like
the
ringing
of
a
distant
bell
what
could
it
mean
was
she
in
love
or
was
she
about
to
die
thinking
thus
she
smiled
sweetly
at
hubertine
who
in
the
act
of
waxing
her
thread
was
looking
at
her
anxiously
moreover
angelique
had
made
a
vow
that
she
would
never
again
see
felicien
she
no
longer
ran
the
risk
of
meeting
him
among
the
brambles
and
wild
grasses
in
the
and
she
had
even
given
up
her
daily
visits
to
the
poor
her
fear
was
intense
lest
were
they
to
find
themselves
face
to
face
something
terrible
might
come
to
pass
in
her
resolution
there
was
mingled
besides
a
feeling
of
penitence
a
wish
to
punish
herself
for
some
fault
she
might
unintentionally
have
committed
so
in
her
days
of
rigid
humiliation
she
condemned
herself
not
even
to
glance
once
through
the
window
so
sure
was
she
of
seeing
on
the
banks
of
the
chevrotte
the
one
whom
she
dreaded
but
after
a
while
being
sorely
tempted
she
looked
out
and
if
it
chanced
that
he
were
not
there
she
was
sad
and
until
the
following
day
one
morning
when
hubert
was
arranging
a
dalmatic
a
ring
at
the
obliged
him
to
go
downstairs
it
must
be
a
customer
no
doubt
an
order
for
some
article
as
hubertine
and
angelique
heard
the
hum
of
voices
which
came
through
the
doorway
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
which
remained
open
then
they
looked
up
in
great
astonishment
for
steps
were
mounting
and
the
embroiderer
was
bringing
someone
with
him
to
the
workroom
a
most
unusual
occurrence
and
the
young
girl
was
quite
overcome
as
she
recognised
felicien
he
was
dressed
simply
like
a
journeyman
artist
whose
hands
are
white
since
she
no
longer
went
to
him
he
had
come
to
her
after
days
of
vain
expectation
and
of
anxious
uncertainty
during
which
he
had
constantly
said
to
himself
that
she
did
not
yet
love
him
since
she
remained
hidden
from
him
look
my
dear
child
here
is
something
which
will
be
of
particular
interest
to
you
explained
hubert
monsieur
wishes
to
give
orders
for
an
exceptional
piece
of
work
and
upon
my
word
that
we
might
talk
of
it
at
our
ease
i
preferred
that
he
should
come
up
here
at
once
this
is
my
daughter
sir
to
whom
you
must
show
your
neither
he
nor
hubertine
had
the
slightest
suspicion
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
young
people
had
met
they
approached
them
only
from
a
sentiment
of
curiosity
to
see
but
felicien
was
like
angelique
almost
stifled
with
emotion
and
timidity
as
he
unrolled
the
design
his
hands
trembled
and
he
was
obliged
to
speak
very
slowly
to
hide
the
change
in
his
voice
it
is
to
be
a
mitre
for
monseigneur
the
bishop
yes
certain
ladies
in
the
city
who
wished
to
make
him
this
present
charged
me
with
the
drawing
of
the
different
parts
as
well
as
with
the
superintendence
of
its
execution
i
am
a
painter
of
stained
glass
but
i
also
occupy
myself
a
great
deal
with
ancient
art
you
will
see
that
i
have
simply
reconstituted
a
gothic
angelique
bent
over
the
great
sheet
of
parchment
which
he
had
spread
before
her
and
started
slightly
as
she
exclaimed
oh
it
is
saint
it
was
indeed
the
youthful
martyr
of
but
thirteen
years
of
age
the
naked
virgin
clothed
with
her
hair
that
had
grown
so
long
only
her
little
hands
and
feet
were
seen
from
under
it
just
as
she
was
upon
the
pillar
at
one
of
the
doors
of
the
cathedral
particularly
however
as
one
found
her
in
the
interior
of
the
church
in
an
old
wooden
statue
that
formerly
was
painted
but
was
a
light
fawn
colour
all
gilded
by
age
she
occupied
the
entire
front
of
the
mitre
half
floating
as
she
was
carried
towards
heaven
borne
by
the
angels
which
below
her
stretched
out
into
the
distance
was
a
fine
delicate
landscape
the
other
sides
and
the
lappets
were
enriched
with
ornaments
of
an
exquisite
style
these
ladies
continued
felicien
wish
to
make
the
present
on
the
occasion
of
the
procession
of
the
miracle
and
naturally
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
choose
saint
the
idea
was
a
most
excellent
one
interposed
hubert
and
hubertine
added
in
her
turn
monseigneur
will
be
deeply
the
procession
of
the
miracle
which
takes
place
each
year
on
july
dates
from
the
time
of
jean
v
d
hautecoeur
who
instituted
it
as
a
thanksgiving
to
god
for
the
miraculous
power
he
had
given
to
him
and
to
his
race
to
save
beaumont
from
the
plague
according
to
the
legend
the
hautecoeurs
are
indebted
for
this
remarkable
gift
to
the
intervention
of
saint
agnes
of
whom
they
were
the
greatest
admirers
and
since
the
most
ancient
time
it
has
been
the
custom
on
the
anniversary
of
her
fete
to
take
down
the
old
statue
of
the
saint
and
carry
it
slowly
in
a
solemn
procession
through
the
streets
of
the
town
in
the
pious
belief
that
she
still
continues
to
disperse
and
drive
away
all
evils
ah
at
last
murmured
angelique
her
eyes
on
the
design
the
procession
of
the
miracle
but
that
will
come
in
a
few
days
and
we
shall
not
have
time
enough
to
finish
the
huberts
shook
their
heads
in
truth
so
delicate
a
piece
of
work
required
the
most
minute
care
and
attention
yet
hubertine
turned
towards
her
daughter
as
she
said
i
could
help
you
my
dear
i
might
attend
to
the
ornaments
and
then
you
will
only
have
the
figure
to
angelique
continued
to
closely
examine
the
figure
of
the
saint
and
was
deeply
troubled
she
said
to
herself
no
she
refused
she
would
not
give
herself
the
pleasure
of
accepting
it
would
be
inexcusable
on
her
part
thus
to
be
an
accomplice
in
a
plan
for
it
was
evident
that
felicien
was
keeping
something
back
she
was
perfectly
sure
that
he
was
not
poor
and
that
he
wore
a
workman
s
dress
simply
as
a
disguise
and
this
affected
simplicity
all
this
history
told
only
that
he
might
approach
her
put
her
on
her
guard
amused
and
happy
though
she
was
in
reality
transfiguring
him
seeing
in
him
the
royal
prince
that
he
should
be
so
thoroughly
did
she
live
in
the
absolute
certainty
of
the
entire
realisation
of
her
dream
sooner
or
later
no
she
repeated
in
a
we
should
not
have
the
needed
and
without
lifting
her
eyes
she
continued
as
if
speaking
to
herself
for
the
saint
we
could
use
neither
the
close
embroidery
nor
the
lace
openwork
it
would
not
be
worthy
of
her
it
should
be
an
embroidery
in
gold
shaded
by
exactly
said
felicien
that
is
what
i
had
already
thought
of
for
i
knew
that
mademoiselle
had
the
secret
of
making
it
there
is
still
quite
a
pretty
little
fragment
of
it
at
the
hubert
was
quite
excited
yes
yes
it
was
made
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
work
was
done
by
one
of
my
ancestresses
shaded
gold
ah
monsieur
there
was
never
anything
equal
to
that
in
the
whole
world
but
unfortunately
it
took
too
much
time
it
cost
altogether
too
dear
and
in
addition
only
a
real
artist
ever
succeeded
in
it
think
of
it
it
is
more
than
two
hundred
years
since
anyone
has
ever
attempted
such
embroidery
and
if
my
daughter
refuses
you
will
be
obliged
to
give
it
up
entirely
for
she
is
the
only
person
who
is
qualified
to
undertake
it
i
do
not
know
of
anyone
else
who
has
the
delicacy
of
fingers
and
the
clearness
of
eye
necessary
for
hubertine
who
since
they
had
spoken
of
the
style
of
the
work
realised
what
a
great
undertaking
it
was
said
in
a
quiet
decided
tone
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
do
it
in
a
fortnight
it
would
need
the
patience
and
skill
of
a
fairy
to
accomplish
but
angelique
who
had
not
ceased
studying
all
the
features
of
the
beautiful
martyr
had
ended
by
making
a
discovery
which
delighted
her
beyond
expression
agnes
resembled
her
in
designing
from
the
old
statue
felicien
certainly
thought
of
her
and
this
idea
that
she
was
in
his
mind
always
present
with
him
that
he
saw
her
everywhere
softened
her
resolution
to
avoid
him
at
last
she
looked
up
she
noticed
how
eager
he
was
and
his
eyes
glistened
with
so
earnest
a
supplication
that
she
was
conquered
still
with
the
intuitive
the
love
of
tormenting
this
natural
science
which
comes
to
all
young
girls
even
when
they
are
entirely
ignorant
of
life
she
did
not
wish
to
have
the
appearance
of
yielding
too
readily
it
is
impossible
she
repeated
i
could
not
do
it
for
felicien
was
in
despair
he
was
sure
he
understood
the
hidden
meaning
in
her
words
it
was
he
whom
she
had
refused
as
well
as
the
work
as
he
was
about
to
go
out
of
the
room
he
said
to
hubert
as
for
the
pay
you
could
have
asked
any
price
you
wished
these
ladies
gave
me
leave
to
offer
as
much
as
three
thousand
the
household
of
the
huberts
was
in
no
way
a
selfish
one
yet
so
great
a
sum
startled
each
member
of
it
the
husband
and
wife
looked
at
each
other
inquiringly
was
it
not
a
pity
to
lose
so
advantageous
an
offer
three
thousand
francs
repeated
angelique
with
her
gentle
voice
did
you
say
three
thousand
francs
monsieur
and
she
to
whom
money
was
nothing
since
she
had
never
known
its
value
kept
back
a
smile
a
mocking
smile
which
scarcely
drew
the
corners
of
her
mouth
rejoicing
that
she
need
not
seem
to
yield
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
and
glad
to
give
him
a
false
opinion
of
herself
oh
monsieur
if
you
can
give
three
thousand
francs
for
it
then
i
accept
i
would
not
do
it
for
everyone
but
from
the
moment
that
one
is
willing
to
pay
so
well
why
that
is
different
if
it
is
necessary
i
can
work
on
it
at
night
as
well
as
during
the
hubert
and
hubertine
then
objected
wishing
to
refuse
in
their
turn
for
fear
the
fatigue
might
be
too
great
for
her
no
she
replied
it
is
never
wise
to
send
away
money
that
is
brought
to
you
you
can
depend
upon
me
monsieur
your
mitre
will
be
ready
the
evening
before
the
felicien
left
the
design
and
bade
them
for
he
was
greatly
disappointed
and
he
had
no
longer
the
courage
to
give
any
new
explanations
in
regard
to
the
work
as
an
excuse
for
stopping
longer
what
would
he
gain
by
doing
so
it
was
certainly
true
that
she
did
not
like
him
for
she
had
pretended
not
to
recognise
him
and
had
treated
him
as
she
would
any
ordinary
customer
whose
money
alone
is
good
to
take
at
first
he
was
angry
as
he
accused
her
of
being
and
grasping
so
much
the
better
it
was
ended
between
them
this
unspoken
romance
and
he
would
never
think
of
her
again
then
as
he
always
did
think
of
her
he
at
last
excused
her
for
was
she
not
dependent
upon
her
work
to
live
and
ought
she
not
to
gain
her
bread
two
days
later
he
was
very
unhappy
and
he
began
to
wander
around
the
house
distressed
that
he
could
not
see
her
she
no
longer
went
out
to
walk
she
did
not
even
go
to
the
balcony
or
to
the
window
as
before
he
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
if
she
cared
not
for
him
if
in
reality
she
was
mercenary
in
spite
of
all
his
love
for
her
increased
daily
as
one
loves
when
only
twenty
years
of
age
without
reasoning
following
merely
the
drawing
of
one
s
heart
simply
for
the
joy
and
the
grief
of
loving
one
morning
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
for
a
moment
and
realised
that
he
could
not
give
her
up
now
she
was
his
chosen
one
and
no
other
whatever
she
might
be
bad
or
good
ugly
or
pretty
poor
or
rich
he
would
give
up
his
life
rather
than
not
be
able
to
claim
her
the
third
day
his
sufferings
were
so
great
that
notwithstanding
all
his
wise
resolves
he
returned
to
the
house
of
the
embroiderers
after
having
rung
the
bell
he
was
received
as
before
downstairs
by
hubert
who
on
account
of
the
want
of
clearness
in
his
explanations
in
regard
to
his
visit
concluded
the
best
thing
to
be
done
was
to
allow
him
to
go
upstairs
again
my
daughter
monsieur
wishes
to
speak
to
you
on
certain
points
of
the
work
that
i
do
not
quite
then
felicien
stammered
if
it
would
not
disturb
mademoiselle
too
much
i
would
like
to
see
how
far
these
ladies
advised
me
to
personally
superintend
the
work
that
is
if
by
doing
so
i
should
not
be
in
anyone
s
angelique
s
heart
beat
violently
when
she
saw
him
come
in
she
almost
choked
but
making
a
great
effort
she
controlled
herself
the
blood
did
not
even
mount
her
cheeks
and
with
an
appearance
of
calm
indifference
she
replied
oh
nothing
ever
disturbs
me
monsieur
i
can
work
equally
well
before
anyone
as
the
design
is
yours
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
wish
to
follow
the
execution
of
quite
discountenanced
by
this
reception
felicien
would
not
have
dared
to
have
taken
a
seat
had
not
hubertine
welcomed
him
cordially
as
she
smiled
in
her
sweet
quiet
way
at
this
excellent
customer
almost
immediately
she
resumed
her
work
bending
over
the
frame
where
she
was
embroidering
on
the
sides
of
the
mitre
the
gothic
ornaments
in
guipure
or
open
lacework
on
his
side
hubert
had
just
taken
down
from
the
wall
a
banner
which
was
finished
had
been
stiffened
and
for
two
days
past
had
been
hung
up
to
dry
and
which
now
he
wished
to
relax
no
one
spoke
the
three
workers
kept
at
their
tasks
as
if
no
other
person
had
been
in
the
room
with
them
in
the
midst
of
this
charming
quiet
the
young
man
little
by
little
grew
calmer
when
the
clock
struck
three
the
shadow
of
the
cathedral
was
already
very
long
and
a
delicate
entered
by
the
window
which
was
wide
open
it
was
almost
like
the
twilight
hour
which
commenced
early
in
the
afternoon
for
this
little
house
so
fresh
and
green
from
all
the
verdure
that
was
about
it
as
it
stood
by
the
side
of
the
colossal
church
a
slight
sound
of
steps
was
heard
on
the
pavement
outside
it
was
a
school
of
young
girls
being
taken
to
confession
in
the
workroom
the
tools
the
walls
everything
which
remained
there
immovable
seemed
to
sleep
in
the
repose
of
the
centuries
and
from
every
corner
came
freshness
and
rest
a
great
square
of
white
light
smooth
and
pure
fell
upon
the
frame
over
which
hubertine
and
angelique
were
bending
with
their
delicate
profiles
in
the
reflection
of
the
gold
mademoiselle
began
felicien
feeling
very
awkward
as
he
realised
that
he
must
give
some
reason
for
his
visit
i
wish
to
say
mademoiselle
that
for
the
hair
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
better
to
employ
gold
rather
than
she
raised
her
head
and
the
laughing
expression
of
her
eyes
clearly
signified
that
he
need
not
have
taken
the
trouble
of
coming
if
he
had
no
other
recommendation
to
make
and
she
looked
down
again
as
she
replied
in
a
tone
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
he
was
indeed
ridiculous
for
he
remarked
then
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
exactly
what
she
was
doing
before
her
was
the
design
he
had
made
but
tinted
with
touched
up
with
gold
with
all
the
delicacy
of
an
old
miniature
a
little
softened
like
what
one
sees
in
some
prayer
books
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
she
copied
this
image
with
the
patience
and
the
skill
of
an
artist
working
with
a
magnifying
glass
after
having
reproduced
it
with
rather
heavy
strokes
upon
the
white
silk
tightly
stretched
and
lined
with
heavy
linen
she
covered
this
silk
with
threads
of
gold
carried
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
fastened
simply
at
the
two
ends
so
that
they
were
left
free
and
close
to
each
other
when
using
the
same
threads
as
a
woof
she
separated
them
with
the
point
of
her
needle
to
find
the
design
below
she
followed
this
same
drawing
recovered
the
gold
threads
with
stitches
of
silk
across
which
she
assorted
according
to
the
colours
of
the
model
in
the
shaded
parts
the
silk
completely
hid
the
gold
in
the
the
stitches
of
silk
were
farther
and
farther
apart
while
the
real
lights
were
made
by
gold
alone
entirely
uncovered
it
was
thus
the
shaded
gold
that
most
beautiful
of
all
work
the
foundation
being
modified
by
the
silks
making
a
picture
of
mellow
colours
as
if
warmed
from
beneath
by
a
glory
and
a
mystic
light
oh
suddenly
said
hubert
who
began
to
stretch
out
the
banner
by
separating
with
his
fingers
the
cords
of
the
trellis
the
masterpiece
of
a
woman
who
embroidered
in
the
olden
time
was
always
in
this
difficult
work
to
become
a
member
of
the
corporation
she
had
to
make
as
it
is
written
in
the
statutes
a
figure
by
itself
in
shaded
gold
a
sixth
part
as
tall
as
if
you
would
have
been
received
my
again
there
was
an
unbroken
silence
felicien
watched
her
constantly
as
she
stooped
forward
absorbed
in
her
task
quite
as
if
she
were
entirely
alone
for
the
hair
of
the
saint
contrary
to
the
general
rule
she
had
had
the
same
idea
as
he
that
was
to
use
no
silk
but
to
gold
with
gold
and
she
kept
ten
needles
at
work
with
this
brilliant
thread
of
all
shades
from
the
dark
red
of
dying
embers
to
the
pale
delicate
yellow
tint
of
the
leaves
of
the
forest
trees
in
the
autumn
agnes
was
thus
covered
from
her
neck
to
her
ankles
with
a
stream
of
golden
hair
it
began
at
the
back
of
her
head
covered
her
body
with
a
thick
mantle
flowed
in
front
of
her
from
the
shoulders
in
two
waves
which
united
under
the
chin
and
fell
down
to
her
feet
in
one
wavy
sheet
it
was
indeed
the
miraculous
hair
a
fabulous
fleece
with
heavy
twists
and
curls
a
glorious
starry
efflorescence
the
warm
and
living
robe
of
a
saint
perfumed
with
its
pure
nudity
that
day
felicien
could
do
nothing
but
watch
angelique
as
she
embroidered
the
curls
following
the
exact
direction
of
their
rolling
with
her
little
pointed
stitches
and
he
never
wearied
of
seeing
the
hair
grow
and
radiate
under
her
magic
needle
its
weight
and
the
great
quivering
with
which
it
seemed
to
be
unrolled
at
one
turn
disturbed
him
hubertine
occupied
in
sewing
on
spangles
hiding
the
thread
with
which
each
one
was
attached
with
a
tiny
round
of
gold
twist
lifted
up
her
head
from
time
to
time
and
gave
him
a
calm
motherly
look
whenever
she
was
obliged
to
throw
into
the
a
spangle
that
was
not
well
made
hubert
who
had
just
taken
away
the
side
pieces
of
wood
that
he
might
unstitch
the
banner
from
the
frame
was
about
folding
it
up
carefully
and
at
last
felicien
whose
embarrassment
was
greatly
increased
by
this
unbroken
silence
realised
that
it
was
best
for
him
to
take
leave
since
as
yet
he
had
not
been
able
to
think
of
any
of
the
suggestions
which
he
had
said
he
intended
to
make
he
rose
blushed
and
stammered
i
will
return
another
day
i
find
that
i
have
so
badly
succeeded
in
reproducing
the
charming
design
of
the
head
of
the
saint
that
you
may
perhaps
have
need
of
some
explanations
from
angelique
looked
him
fully
in
the
face
with
her
sweet
great
eyes
oh
not
at
all
but
come
again
monsieur
do
not
hesitate
to
do
so
if
you
are
in
the
least
anxious
about
the
execution
of
the
he
went
away
happy
from
the
permission
given
him
but
chilled
by
the
coldness
of
manner
of
the
young
girl
yes
he
realised
that
she
did
not
now
and
never
would
love
him
that
being
the
case
what
use
was
there
in
seeing
her
yet
on
the
morrow
as
well
as
on
the
following
days
he
did
not
fail
to
go
to
the
little
house
on
the
rue
des
orfevres
the
hours
which
he
could
not
pass
there
were
sad
enough
tortured
as
he
was
by
his
uncertainties
distressed
by
his
mental
struggles
he
was
never
calm
except
when
he
was
near
her
as
she
sat
at
her
frame
provided
that
she
was
by
his
side
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
resign
himself
to
the
acceptance
of
the
fact
that
he
was
disagreeable
to
her
every
morning
he
arrived
at
an
early
hour
spoke
of
the
work
then
seated
himself
as
if
his
presence
there
were
absolutely
necessary
then
he
was
in
a
state
of
enchantment
simply
to
look
at
her
with
her
finely
cut
features
her
motionless
profile
which
seemed
bathed
in
the
liquid
golden
tints
of
her
hair
and
he
watched
in
ecstasy
the
skilful
play
of
her
flexible
hands
as
she
moved
them
up
and
down
in
the
midst
of
the
needlefuls
of
gold
or
silk
she
had
become
so
habituated
to
his
presence
that
she
was
quite
at
her
ease
and
treated
him
as
a
comrade
nevertheless
he
always
felt
that
there
was
between
them
something
unexpressed
which
grieved
him
to
the
heart
he
knew
not
why
occasionally
she
looked
up
regarding
him
with
an
amused
air
and
with
an
inquiring
impatient
expression
in
her
face
then
finding
he
was
intensely
embarrassed
she
at
once
became
very
cold
and
distant
but
felicien
had
discovered
one
way
in
which
he
could
rouse
her
and
he
took
advantage
of
it
it
was
this
to
talk
to
her
of
her
art
of
the
ancient
masterpieces
of
embroidery
he
had
seen
either
preserved
among
the
treasures
of
cathedrals
or
copies
of
which
were
engraved
in
books
for
instance
there
were
the
superb
copes
that
of
charlemagne
in
red
silk
with
the
great
eagles
with
unfurled
wings
and
the
cope
of
sion
which
is
decorated
with
a
multitude
of
saintly
figures
then
the
dalmatic
which
is
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
piece
of
embroidery
in
the
whole
world
the
imperial
dalmatic
on
which
is
celebrated
the
glory
of
jesus
christ
upon
the
earth
and
in
heaven
the
transfiguration
and
the
last
judgment
in
which
the
different
personages
are
embroidered
in
silks
of
various
colours
and
in
silver
and
gold
also
there
is
a
wonderful
tree
of
jesse
an
orfrey
of
silk
upon
satin
which
is
so
perfect
it
seems
as
if
it
were
detached
from
a
window
of
the
fifteenth
century
abraham
at
the
foot
then
david
solomon
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
at
the
very
top
the
saviour
among
the
admirable
chasubles
he
had
seen
one
in
particular
was
touching
in
its
simplicity
it
represented
christ
on
the
cross
and
the
drops
of
blood
from
his
side
and
his
feet
were
made
by
little
splashes
of
red
silk
on
the
cloth
of
gold
while
in
the
foreground
was
mary
tenderly
supported
by
saint
john
on
another
one
which
is
called
the
chasuble
of
naintre
the
virgin
is
seated
in
majesty
with
sandals
on
her
feet
and
holding
the
infant
jesus
on
her
knees
others
and
still
others
of
marvelous
workmanship
were
alluded
to
venerable
not
only
from
their
great
age
and
the
beautiful
faith
that
they
expressed
but
from
a
richness
unknown
in
our
time
preserving
the
odour
of
the
incense
of
tabernacles
and
the
mystic
light
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
gold
ah
sighed
angelique
all
those
exquisite
things
are
finished
now
we
can
only
find
certain
tones
to
remind
us
of
their
with
feverish
hands
and
sparkling
eyes
she
stopped
working
when
felicien
related
to
her
the
history
of
the
most
noted
men
and
women
who
were
embroiderers
in
the
olden
time
simonne
de
gaules
colin
jolye
and
others
whose
names
have
come
down
to
us
through
the
ages
then
after
a
few
moments
she
took
up
her
needles
again
and
made
them
fly
vigorously
as
she
appeared
transfigured
and
guarded
on
her
face
the
traces
of
the
delight
her
artist
nature
had
received
in
listening
to
all
these
accounts
never
had
she
seemed
to
him
more
beautiful
so
enthusiastic
was
she
so
maidenly
and
so
pure
seated
there
in
the
brighter
surroundings
of
so
many
coloured
silks
applying
herself
with
unfailing
exactitude
to
her
work
into
the
slightest
details
of
which
she
put
her
whole
soul
when
he
had
left
off
speaking
he
looked
at
her
earnestly
until
roused
by
the
silence
she
realised
the
excited
state
into
which
all
these
histories
had
thrown
her
and
became
as
embarrassed
as
if
she
had
done
something
wrong
oh
dear
look
all
my
silks
are
entangled
again
mother
please
not
to
move
about
so
hubertine
who
had
not
stirred
at
all
was
amused
but
simply
smiled
without
saying
anything
at
first
she
had
been
rather
disturbed
by
the
constant
attentions
of
the
young
man
and
had
talked
the
matter
over
thoroughly
with
hubert
one
evening
in
their
room
but
they
could
not
help
being
drawn
towards
him
and
as
in
every
respect
his
appearance
was
good
and
his
manners
perfectly
respectful
they
concluded
it
was
not
necessary
to
object
to
interviews
from
which
angelique
derived
so
much
happiness
so
matters
were
allowed
to
take
their
way
and
she
watched
over
the
young
people
with
a
loving
air
of
protection
moreover
she
herself
for
many
days
had
been
oppressed
by
the
lamenting
caresses
of
her
husband
who
seemed
never
to
weary
of
asking
her
if
he
had
been
forgiven
this
month
was
the
anniversary
of
the
time
when
they
had
lost
their
child
and
each
year
at
this
date
they
had
the
same
regrets
and
the
same
longings
he
trembling
at
her
feet
happy
to
realise
that
he
was
pardoned
she
loving
and
distressed
blaming
herself
for
everything
and
despairing
that
fate
had
been
inexorable
to
all
their
prayers
they
spoke
of
all
this
to
no
one
were
the
same
to
outsiders
in
every
way
but
this
increase
of
tenderness
between
them
came
from
their
room
like
a
silent
perfume
disengaged
itself
from
their
persons
at
the
least
movement
by
each
word
and
by
their
way
of
looking
at
each
other
when
it
seemed
as
if
for
the
moment
they
almost
exchanged
souls
all
this
was
like
the
grave
accompaniment
the
deep
continuous
bass
upon
which
sang
in
clear
notes
the
two
hearts
of
the
young
couple
one
week
had
passed
and
the
work
on
the
mitre
advanced
these
daily
meetings
had
assumed
a
great
and
sweet
familiarity
the
forehead
should
be
very
high
should
it
not
without
any
trace
of
eyebrows
yes
very
high
and
not
the
slightest
shade
quite
like
an
old
will
you
pass
me
the
white
silk
wait
a
minute
that
i
may
thread
he
helped
her
and
this
union
of
work
put
them
at
their
ease
it
made
the
occupation
of
each
day
seem
perfectly
natural
to
them
both
and
without
a
word
of
love
ever
having
been
spoken
without
their
hands
having
once
met
by
a
voluntary
touch
the
bond
between
them
grew
stronger
each
hour
and
they
were
henceforth
eternally
united
one
to
the
other
it
was
sufficient
for
them
to
have
lived
until
now
father
what
are
you
doing
that
we
no
longer
hear
you
she
turned
and
saw
hubert
who
was
occupied
in
winding
a
long
spool
as
his
eyes
were
fixed
abstractedly
on
his
wife
i
am
preparing
some
gold
thread
for
your
and
from
the
reel
taken
to
his
wife
from
the
mute
thanks
of
hubertine
from
the
constant
little
attentions
her
husband
gave
her
there
was
a
warm
caressing
breath
which
surrounded
and
enveloped
angelique
and
felicien
as
they
both
bent
again
over
the
frame
the
workroom
itself
this
ancient
hall
as
it
might
almost
be
called
with
its
old
tools
and
its
peace
of
other
ages
was
an
unconscious
accomplice
in
this
work
of
union
it
seemed
so
far
away
from
the
noise
of
the
street
remote
as
if
in
dreamy
depths
in
this
country
of
good
simple
souls
where
miracles
reign
the
easy
realisation
of
all
joys
in
five
days
the
mitre
was
to
be
finished
and
angelique
now
sure
that
it
would
be
ready
to
be
delivered
and
that
she
would
even
have
hours
to
spare
took
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
and
seemed
suddenly
astonished
at
finding
felicien
so
near
her
with
his
elbows
on
the
trestle
had
they
really
become
such
intimate
friends
she
no
longer
attempted
to
struggle
against
what
she
realised
was
his
conquering
power
her
smiles
ceased
at
what
he
tried
to
keep
back
and
which
she
so
well
understood
in
spite
of
his
subterfuges
what
was
it
then
that
had
made
her
as
if
asleep
in
her
late
restless
waiting
and
the
eternal
question
returned
the
question
that
she
asked
herself
every
evening
when
she
went
to
her
room
did
she
love
him
for
hours
in
the
middle
of
her
great
bed
she
had
turned
over
again
and
again
these
words
seeking
for
meanings
she
could
not
find
and
thinking
she
was
too
ignorant
to
explain
them
but
that
night
all
at
once
she
felt
her
heart
was
softened
by
some
inexplicable
happiness
she
cried
nervously
without
reason
and
hid
her
head
in
her
pillow
that
no
one
might
hear
her
yes
now
she
loved
him
she
loved
him
enough
to
be
willing
to
die
for
him
but
why
but
how
she
could
not
tell
she
never
would
know
simply
from
her
whole
heart
came
the
cry
that
she
did
indeed
love
him
the
light
had
come
to
her
at
last
this
new
overpowering
joy
overwhelmed
her
like
the
most
ardent
rays
of
the
sun
for
a
long
time
her
tears
flowed
but
not
from
sorrow
on
the
contrary
she
was
filled
with
an
inexplicable
confusion
of
happiness
that
was
indefinable
regretting
now
more
deeply
than
ever
that
she
had
not
made
a
of
hubertine
her
secret
burdened
her
and
she
made
an
earnest
vow
to
herself
that
henceforth
she
would
be
as
cold
as
an
icicle
towards
felicien
and
would
suffer
everything
rather
than
allow
him
to
see
her
tenderness
he
should
never
know
it
to
love
him
merely
to
love
him
without
even
acknowledging
it
that
was
the
punishment
the
trial
she
must
undergo
to
pardon
her
fault
it
would
be
to
her
in
reality
a
delicious
suffering
she
thought
of
the
martyrs
of
whom
she
had
read
in
the
golden
legend
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
their
sister
in
torturing
herself
in
this
way
and
that
her
guardian
angel
agnes
would
look
at
her
henceforward
with
sadder
sweeter
eyes
than
ever
the
following
day
angelique
finished
the
mitre
she
had
embroidered
with
split
silk
light
as
gossamer
the
little
hands
and
feet
which
were
the
only
points
of
white
naked
flesh
that
came
out
from
the
royal
mantle
of
golden
hair
she
perfected
the
face
with
all
the
delicacy
of
the
purest
lily
wherein
the
gold
seemed
like
the
blood
in
the
veins
under
the
delicate
silken
skin
and
this
face
radiant
as
the
sun
was
turned
heavenward
as
the
youthful
saint
was
borne
upward
by
the
angels
toward
the
distant
horizon
of
the
blue
plain
when
felicien
entered
that
day
he
exclaimed
with
admiration
oh
how
exactly
she
looks
like
it
was
an
involuntary
expression
an
acknowledgment
of
the
resemblance
he
had
purposely
put
in
the
design
he
realised
the
fact
after
he
had
spoken
and
blushed
deeply
that
is
indeed
true
my
little
one
she
has
the
same
beautiful
eyes
that
you
have
said
hubert
who
had
come
forward
to
examine
the
work
hubertine
merely
smiled
now
having
made
a
similar
remark
many
days
before
and
she
was
surprised
and
grieved
when
she
heard
angelique
reply
in
a
harsh
disagreeable
tone
of
voice
like
that
she
sometimes
had
in
her
fits
of
obstinacy
years
ago
my
beautiful
eyes
why
will
you
make
fun
of
me
in
that
way
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
i
am
very
then
getting
up
she
shook
out
her
dress
overacting
her
assumed
character
of
a
harsh
avaricious
girl
ah
at
last
it
is
really
finished
i
am
thankful
for
it
was
too
much
of
a
task
too
heavy
a
burden
on
my
shoulders
do
you
know
i
would
never
undertake
to
make
another
one
for
the
same
price
felicien
listened
to
her
in
amazement
could
it
be
that
after
all
she
still
cared
only
for
money
had
he
been
mistaken
when
he
thought
at
times
she
was
so
exquisitely
tender
and
so
passionately
devoted
to
her
artistic
work
did
she
in
reality
wish
for
the
pay
her
labour
brought
her
and
was
she
so
indifferent
that
she
rejoiced
at
the
completion
of
her
task
wishing
neither
to
see
nor
to
hear
of
it
again
for
several
days
he
had
been
discouraged
as
he
sought
in
vain
for
some
pretext
of
continuing
later
on
visits
that
gave
him
such
pleasure
but
alas
it
was
plain
that
she
did
not
care
for
him
in
the
least
and
that
she
never
would
love
him
his
suffering
was
so
great
that
he
grew
very
pale
and
could
scarcely
speak
but
mademoiselle
will
you
not
make
up
the
mitre
no
mother
can
do
it
so
much
better
than
i
can
i
am
too
happy
at
the
thought
that
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
but
do
you
not
like
the
work
which
you
do
so
well
i
i
do
not
like
anything
in
the
hubertine
was
obliged
to
speak
to
her
sternly
and
tell
her
to
be
quiet
she
then
begged
felicien
to
be
so
good
as
to
pardon
her
nervous
child
who
was
a
little
weary
from
her
application
she
added
that
the
mitre
would
be
at
his
disposal
at
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
it
was
the
same
as
if
she
had
asked
him
to
go
away
but
he
could
not
leave
he
stood
and
looked
around
him
in
this
old
workroom
filled
with
shade
and
with
peace
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
being
driven
from
paradise
he
had
spent
so
many
sweet
hours
there
in
the
illusion
of
his
brightest
fancies
that
it
was
like
tearing
his
very
to
think
all
this
was
at
an
end
what
troubled
him
the
worst
was
his
inability
to
explain
matters
and
that
he
could
only
take
with
him
such
a
fearful
uncertainty
at
last
he
said
resolved
to
risk
everything
at
the
first
opportunity
rather
than
not
to
know
the
truth
scarcely
had
he
closed
the
door
when
hubert
asked
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
child
are
you
ill
no
indeed
it
is
simply
that
i
am
tired
of
having
that
young
man
here
i
do
not
wish
to
see
him
then
hubertine
added
very
well
you
will
not
see
him
again
but
nothing
should
ever
prevent
one
from
being
angelique
making
some
trivial
excuse
hurried
up
to
her
room
as
quickly
as
possible
then
she
gave
free
course
to
her
tears
ah
how
intensely
happy
she
was
yet
how
she
suffered
her
poor
dear
beloved
he
was
sad
enough
when
he
found
he
must
leave
her
but
she
must
not
forget
that
she
had
made
a
vow
to
the
saints
that
although
she
loved
him
better
than
life
he
should
never
know
it
chapter
viii
on
the
evening
of
this
same
day
immediately
after
leaving
the
angelique
complained
of
not
being
at
all
well
and
went
up
at
once
to
her
room
the
agitation
and
excitement
of
the
morning
her
struggles
against
her
true
self
had
quite
exhausted
her
she
made
haste
to
go
to
bed
and
covering
her
head
with
the
sheet
with
a
desperate
feeling
of
disappearing
for
ever
if
she
could
again
the
tears
came
to
her
relief
the
hours
passed
slowly
and
soon
it
was
night
a
warm
july
night
the
heavy
oppressive
quiet
of
which
entered
through
the
window
which
had
been
left
wide
open
in
the
dark
heavens
glistened
a
multitude
of
stars
it
must
have
been
nearly
eleven
o
clock
and
the
moon
already
grown
quite
thin
in
its
last
quarter
would
not
rise
until
midnight
and
in
the
obscure
chamber
angelique
still
wept
nervously
a
flow
of
inexhaustible
tears
seemingly
without
reason
when
a
slight
noise
at
her
door
caused
her
to
lift
up
her
head
there
was
a
short
silence
when
a
voice
called
her
tenderly
angelique
angelique
my
darling
child
she
recognised
the
voice
of
hubertine
without
doubt
the
latter
in
her
room
with
her
husband
had
just
heard
the
distant
sound
of
sobbing
and
anxious
she
had
come
upstairs
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
with
her
daughter
angelique
are
you
ill
my
dear
retaining
her
breath
the
young
girl
made
no
answer
she
did
not
wish
to
be
unkind
but
her
one
absorbing
idea
at
this
moment
was
of
solitude
to
be
alone
was
the
only
possible
alleviation
of
her
trouble
a
word
of
consolation
a
caress
even
from
her
mother
would
have
distressed
her
she
imagined
that
she
saw
her
standing
at
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
from
the
delicacy
of
the
rustling
movement
on
the
tiled
floor
she
thought
she
must
be
barefooted
two
or
three
minutes
passed
and
she
knew
the
kind
watcher
had
not
left
her
place
but
that
stooping
and
holding
with
her
beautiful
hands
the
clothing
so
carelessly
thrown
over
her
she
still
listened
at
the
keyhole
hubertine
hearing
nothing
more
not
even
a
sigh
did
not
like
to
call
again
she
was
very
sure
that
she
had
heard
sobs
but
if
the
child
had
at
last
been
able
to
sleep
what
good
would
it
do
to
awaken
her
she
waited
however
another
moment
troubled
by
the
thought
of
a
grief
which
her
daughter
hid
from
her
confusedly
imagining
what
it
might
be
from
the
tender
emotion
with
which
her
heart
seemed
filled
from
sympathy
at
last
she
concluded
to
go
down
as
she
had
come
up
quietly
her
hands
being
so
familiar
with
every
turning
that
she
needed
no
candle
and
leaving
behind
her
no
other
sound
than
the
soft
light
touch
of
her
bare
feet
then
sitting
up
in
bed
angelique
in
her
turn
listened
so
profound
was
the
outward
silence
that
she
could
clearly
distinguish
the
slight
pressure
of
the
heel
on
the
edge
of
each
step
of
the
stairway
at
the
foot
the
door
of
the
chamber
was
opened
then
closed
again
afterward
she
heard
a
murmur
an
affectionate
yet
sad
blending
of
voices
in
a
no
doubt
it
was
what
her
father
and
mother
were
saying
of
her
the
fears
and
the
hopes
they
had
in
regard
to
her
for
a
long
time
that
continued
although
they
must
have
put
out
their
light
and
gone
to
bed
never
before
had
any
night
sounds
in
this
old
house
mounted
in
this
way
to
her
ears
ordinarily
she
slept
the
heavy
tranquil
sleep
of
youth
she
heard
nothing
whatever
after
placing
her
head
upon
her
pillow
whilst
now
in
the
wakefulness
caused
by
the
inner
combat
against
an
almost
overpowering
sentiment
of
affection
which
she
was
determined
to
conquer
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
the
whole
house
were
in
unison
with
her
that
it
was
also
in
love
and
mourned
like
herself
were
not
the
huberts
too
sad
as
they
stilled
their
tears
and
thought
of
the
child
they
had
lost
long
ago
whose
place
alas
had
never
been
filled
she
knew
nothing
of
this
in
reality
but
she
had
a
sensation
in
this
warm
night
of
the
watch
of
her
parents
below
her
and
of
the
disappointment
in
their
lives
which
they
could
not
forget
notwithstanding
their
great
love
for
each
other
which
was
always
as
fresh
as
when
they
were
young
whilst
she
was
seated
in
this
way
listening
in
the
house
that
trembled
and
sighed
angelique
lost
all
and
again
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
silently
but
warm
and
living
as
if
they
were
her
life
s
blood
one
question
above
all
others
had
troubled
her
since
the
early
morning
and
had
grieved
her
deeply
was
she
right
in
having
sent
away
felicien
in
despair
stabbed
to
the
heart
by
her
coldness
and
with
the
thought
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
knew
that
she
did
love
him
yet
she
had
willingly
caused
him
to
suffer
and
now
in
her
turn
she
was
suffering
intensely
why
should
there
be
so
much
pain
connected
with
love
did
the
saints
wish
for
tears
could
it
be
that
agnes
her
guardian
angel
was
angry
in
the
knowledge
that
she
was
happy
now
for
the
first
time
she
was
distracted
by
a
doubt
before
this
whenever
she
thought
of
the
hero
she
awaited
and
who
must
come
sooner
or
later
she
had
arranged
everything
much
more
satisfactorily
when
the
right
time
arrived
he
was
to
enter
her
very
room
where
she
would
immediately
recognise
and
welcome
him
when
they
would
both
go
away
together
to
be
united
for
evermore
but
how
different
was
the
reality
he
had
come
and
instead
of
what
she
had
foreseen
their
meeting
was
most
unsatisfactory
they
were
equally
unhappy
and
were
eternally
separated
to
what
purpose
why
had
this
result
come
to
pass
who
had
exacted
from
her
so
strange
a
vow
that
although
he
might
be
very
dear
to
her
she
was
never
to
let
him
know
it
but
yet
again
angelique
was
especially
grieved
from
the
fear
that
she
might
have
been
bad
and
done
some
very
wrong
thing
perhaps
the
original
sin
that
was
in
her
had
manifested
itself
again
as
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
thought
over
all
her
acts
of
pretended
indifference
the
mocking
air
with
which
she
had
received
felicien
and
the
malicious
pleasure
she
took
in
giving
him
a
false
idea
of
herself
and
the
astonishment
at
what
she
had
done
added
to
a
cutting
remorse
for
her
cruelty
increased
her
distress
now
her
whole
heart
was
filled
with
a
deep
infinite
pity
for
the
suffering
she
had
caused
him
without
really
meaning
to
do
so
she
saw
him
constantly
before
her
as
he
was
when
he
left
the
house
in
the
morning
the
despairing
expression
of
his
face
his
troubled
eyes
his
trembling
lips
and
in
imagination
she
followed
him
through
the
streets
as
he
went
home
pale
utterly
desolate
and
wounded
to
the
heart
s
core
by
her
where
was
he
now
perhaps
at
this
hour
he
was
really
ill
she
wrung
her
hands
in
agony
distressed
that
she
could
not
at
once
repair
the
evil
she
had
done
ah
how
she
revolted
at
the
idea
of
having
made
another
suffer
for
she
had
always
wished
to
be
good
and
to
render
those
about
her
as
happy
as
possible
twelve
o
clock
would
ere
long
ring
out
from
the
old
the
great
elms
of
the
garden
of
the
bishop
s
palace
hid
the
moon
which
was
just
appearing
above
the
horizon
and
the
chamber
was
still
dark
then
letting
her
head
fall
back
upon
the
pillow
angelique
dwelt
no
longer
upon
these
disturbing
questions
as
she
wished
to
go
to
sleep
but
this
she
could
not
do
although
she
kept
her
eyes
closed
her
mind
was
still
active
she
thought
of
the
flowers
which
every
night
during
the
last
fortnight
she
had
found
when
she
went
upstairs
upon
the
balcony
before
her
window
each
evening
it
was
a
lovely
bouquet
of
violets
which
felicien
had
certainly
thrown
there
from
the
she
recollected
having
told
him
that
flowers
generally
gave
her
a
sick
headache
whilst
violets
alone
had
the
singular
virtue
of
calming
her
and
so
he
had
sent
her
quiet
nights
a
perfumed
sleep
refreshed
by
pleasant
dreams
this
evening
she
had
placed
the
bouquet
by
her
bedside
all
at
once
she
had
the
happy
thought
of
taking
it
into
her
bed
with
her
putting
it
near
her
cheek
and
little
by
little
being
soothed
with
its
sweet
breath
the
purple
blossoms
did
indeed
do
her
good
not
that
she
slept
however
but
she
lay
there
with
closed
eyes
penetrated
by
the
refreshing
odour
that
came
from
his
gift
happy
to
await
events
in
a
repose
and
confident
abandonment
of
her
whole
being
but
suddenly
she
started
it
was
past
midnight
she
opened
her
eyes
and
was
astonished
to
find
her
chamber
filled
with
a
clear
bright
light
above
the
great
elms
the
moon
rose
slowly
dimming
the
stars
in
the
pale
sky
through
the
window
she
saw
the
apse
of
the
cathedral
almost
white
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
it
were
the
reflection
of
this
whiteness
which
entered
her
room
like
the
light
of
the
dawn
fresh
and
pure
the
whitewashed
walls
and
beams
all
this
blank
nudity
was
increased
by
it
enlarged
and
moved
back
as
if
it
were
unreal
as
a
dream
she
still
recognised
however
the
old
dark
oaken
furniture
the
wardrobe
the
chest
and
the
chairs
with
the
shining
edges
of
their
elaborate
carvings
the
bedstead
alone
this
great
square
royal
couch
seemed
new
to
her
as
if
she
saw
it
for
the
first
time
with
its
high
columns
supporting
its
canopy
of
cretonne
now
bathed
with
such
a
sheet
of
deep
moonlight
that
she
half
thought
she
was
on
a
cloud
in
the
midst
of
the
heavens
borne
along
by
a
flight
of
silent
invisible
wings
for
a
moment
she
felt
the
full
swinging
of
it
it
did
not
seem
at
all
strange
or
unnatural
to
her
but
her
sight
soon
grew
accustomed
to
the
reality
her
bed
was
again
in
its
usual
corner
and
she
was
in
it
not
moving
her
head
her
eyes
alone
turning
from
side
to
side
as
she
lay
in
the
midst
of
this
lake
of
beaming
rays
with
the
bouquet
of
violets
upon
her
lips
why
was
it
that
she
was
thus
in
a
state
of
waiting
why
could
she
not
sleep
she
was
sure
that
she
expected
someone
that
she
had
grown
quite
calm
was
a
sign
that
her
hero
was
about
to
appear
this
consoling
light
which
put
to
flight
the
darkness
of
all
bad
dreams
announced
his
arrival
he
was
on
his
way
and
the
moon
whose
brightness
almost
equalled
that
of
the
sun
was
simply
his
forerunner
she
must
be
ready
to
greet
him
the
chamber
was
as
if
hung
with
white
velvet
now
so
they
could
see
each
other
well
then
she
got
up
dressed
herself
thoroughly
putting
on
a
simple
white
gown
of
foulard
the
same
she
had
worn
the
day
of
their
excursion
to
the
ruins
of
hautecoeur
she
did
not
braid
her
hair
but
let
it
hang
over
her
shoulders
she
put
a
pair
of
slippers
upon
her
bare
feet
and
drawing
an
armchair
in
front
of
the
window
seated
herself
and
waited
in
patience
angelique
did
not
pretend
to
know
how
he
would
appear
without
doubt
he
would
not
come
up
the
stairs
and
it
might
be
that
she
would
simply
see
him
over
the
while
she
leaned
from
the
balcony
still
she
kept
her
place
on
the
threshold
of
the
window
as
it
seemed
to
her
useless
to
go
and
watch
for
him
just
yet
so
vague
was
her
idea
of
real
life
so
mystic
was
love
that
she
did
not
understand
in
her
imaginative
nature
why
he
might
not
pass
through
the
walls
like
the
saints
in
the
legends
why
should
not
miracles
come
now
as
in
the
olden
days
for
had
not
all
this
been
ordained
from
the
beginning
not
for
a
moment
did
she
think
she
was
alone
to
receive
him
no
indeed
she
felt
as
if
she
were
surrounded
by
the
crowd
of
virgins
who
had
always
been
near
her
since
her
early
youth
they
entered
on
the
rays
of
the
moonlight
they
came
from
the
great
dark
trees
with
their
tops
in
the
bishop
s
garden
from
the
most
intricate
corners
of
the
entanglement
of
the
stone
front
of
the
cathedral
from
all
the
familiar
and
beloved
horizon
of
the
chevrotte
from
the
willows
the
grasses
and
bushes
the
young
girl
heard
the
dreams
which
came
back
to
her
the
hopes
the
desires
the
visions
all
that
which
she
had
put
of
herself
into
inanimate
objects
as
she
saw
them
daily
and
which
they
now
returned
to
her
never
had
the
voices
of
the
invisible
unknown
spoken
so
clearly
she
listened
to
them
as
they
came
from
afar
recognising
particularly
in
this
warm
beautiful
night
so
calm
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
movement
in
the
air
the
delicate
sound
which
she
was
wont
to
call
the
fluttering
of
the
robe
of
agnes
when
her
dear
guardian
angel
came
to
her
side
she
laughed
quietly
to
know
that
she
was
now
by
her
and
waiting
with
the
others
who
were
near
her
time
passed
but
it
did
not
seem
long
to
angelique
she
was
quite
conscious
of
what
was
passing
around
her
it
appeared
to
her
perfectly
natural
and
exactly
as
it
had
been
foretold
when
at
last
she
saw
felicien
striding
over
the
balustrade
of
the
balcony
his
tall
figure
came
out
in
full
relief
before
the
background
of
the
white
sky
he
did
not
approach
the
open
window
but
remained
in
its
luminous
shadow
do
not
be
afraid
it
is
i
have
come
to
see
she
was
not
in
the
slightest
way
alarmed
she
simply
thought
that
he
was
exact
to
the
hour
of
meeting
and
said
calmly
you
mounted
by
the
timber
framework
did
you
not
yes
by
the
the
idea
of
this
way
made
her
laugh
and
he
himself
was
amused
by
it
he
had
in
fact
pulled
himself
up
by
the
shed
then
climbing
along
the
principal
rafters
from
there
whose
ends
were
supported
by
the
of
the
first
story
he
had
without
difficulty
reached
the
balcony
i
was
expecting
you
will
you
not
come
nearer
me
felicien
who
had
arrived
in
a
state
of
anger
not
knowing
how
he
had
dared
to
come
but
with
many
wild
ideas
in
his
head
did
not
move
so
surprised
and
delighted
was
he
by
this
unexpected
reception
as
he
had
come
at
last
angelique
was
now
certain
that
the
saints
did
not
prohibit
her
from
loving
for
she
heard
them
welcoming
him
with
her
by
a
laugh
as
delicate
as
a
breath
of
the
night
where
in
the
world
had
she
ever
found
so
ridiculous
an
idea
as
to
think
that
agnes
would
be
angry
with
her
on
the
contrary
agnes
was
radiant
with
a
joy
that
she
felt
as
it
descended
on
her
shoulders
and
enveloped
her
like
a
caress
from
two
great
wings
all
those
who
had
died
for
love
showed
great
compassion
for
youthful
troubles
and
only
returned
to
earth
on
summer
nights
that
although
invisible
they
might
watch
those
young
hearts
who
were
sorrowful
from
affection
but
why
do
you
not
come
to
me
i
was
waiting
for
then
hesitatingly
felicien
approached
he
had
been
so
excited
so
carried
away
by
anger
at
her
indifference
that
he
had
said
she
should
be
made
to
love
him
and
that
were
it
necessary
he
would
carry
her
away
even
against
her
will
and
lo
now
finding
her
so
gentle
as
he
penetrated
almost
to
the
entrance
of
this
chamber
so
pure
and
white
he
became
subdued
at
once
and
as
gentle
and
submissive
as
a
child
he
took
three
steps
forward
but
he
was
afraid
and
not
daring
to
go
farther
he
fell
on
his
knees
at
the
end
of
the
balcony
could
you
but
know
he
said
the
abominable
tortures
i
have
passed
through
i
have
never
imagined
a
worse
suffering
really
the
only
true
grief
is
to
think
that
you
are
not
beloved
by
the
person
to
whom
you
have
given
your
affection
i
would
willingly
give
up
all
else
would
consent
to
be
poor
dying
from
hunger
or
racked
by
pain
but
i
will
not
pass
another
day
with
this
terrible
doubt
gnawing
at
my
heart
of
thinking
that
you
do
not
love
me
be
good
i
pray
you
and
pity
she
listened
to
him
silent
overcome
with
compassion
yet
very
happy
withal
this
morning
you
sent
me
away
in
such
a
dreadful
manner
i
had
fancied
to
myself
that
you
had
changed
your
feelings
towards
me
and
that
appreciating
my
affection
you
liked
me
better
but
alas
i
found
you
exactly
as
you
had
been
on
the
first
day
cold
indifferent
treating
me
as
you
would
have
done
any
other
simple
customer
who
passed
recalling
me
harshly
to
the
commonplaces
of
life
on
the
stairway
i
staggered
once
outside
i
ran
and
was
afraid
i
might
scream
aloud
then
the
moment
i
reached
home
it
seemed
to
me
i
should
stifle
were
i
to
enter
the
house
so
i
rushed
out
into
the
fields
walking
by
chance
first
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
then
on
another
evening
came
and
i
was
still
wandering
up
and
down
but
the
torment
of
spirit
moved
faster
than
ever
and
devoured
me
when
one
is
hopelessly
in
love
it
is
impossible
to
escape
from
the
pains
accompanying
one
s
affection
listen
he
said
and
he
touched
his
breast
it
is
here
that
you
stabbed
me
and
the
point
of
the
knife
still
continues
to
penetrate
deeper
and
he
gave
a
long
sigh
at
the
keen
recollection
of
his
torture
i
found
myself
at
last
in
a
thicket
overcome
by
my
distress
like
a
tree
that
has
been
drawn
up
by
the
roots
to
me
the
only
thing
that
existed
in
life
in
the
future
was
you
the
thought
that
you
might
never
be
mine
was
more
than
i
could
bear
already
my
feet
were
so
weary
that
they
would
no
longer
support
me
i
felt
that
my
hands
were
growing
icy
cold
and
my
head
was
filled
with
the
strangest
fancies
and
that
is
why
i
am
here
i
do
not
know
at
all
how
i
came
or
where
i
found
the
necessary
strength
to
bring
me
to
you
you
must
try
to
forgive
me
but
had
i
been
forced
to
do
so
i
would
have
broken
open
doors
with
my
fists
i
would
have
clambered
up
to
this
balcony
in
broad
daylight
for
my
will
was
no
longer
under
my
control
and
i
was
quite
wild
now
will
you
not
pardon
me
she
was
a
little
in
the
shadow
and
he
on
his
knees
in
the
full
moonlight
could
not
see
that
she
had
grown
very
pale
in
her
tender
repentance
and
was
too
touched
by
his
story
to
be
able
to
speak
he
thought
that
she
was
still
insensible
to
his
pleadings
and
he
joined
his
hands
together
most
beseechingly
all
my
interest
in
you
commenced
long
ago
it
was
one
night
when
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
here
at
your
window
you
were
only
a
vague
white
shadow
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
one
of
your
features
yet
i
saw
you
and
imagined
you
just
as
you
are
in
reality
but
i
was
timid
and
afraid
so
for
several
days
i
wandered
about
here
never
daring
to
try
to
meet
you
in
the
open
day
and
in
addition
since
this
is
a
confession
i
must
tell
you
everything
you
pleased
me
particularly
in
this
half
mystery
it
would
have
disturbed
me
to
have
you
come
out
from
it
for
my
great
happiness
was
to
dream
of
you
as
if
you
were
an
apparition
or
an
unknown
something
to
be
worshipped
from
afar
without
ever
hoping
to
become
acquainted
with
you
later
on
i
knew
who
you
were
for
after
all
it
is
difficult
to
resist
the
temptation
to
know
what
may
be
the
realisation
of
one
s
dream
it
was
then
that
my
restlessness
commenced
it
has
increased
at
each
meeting
do
you
recollect
the
first
time
that
we
spoke
to
each
other
in
the
field
near
by
on
that
forenoon
when
i
was
examining
the
painted
window
never
in
my
life
did
i
feel
so
awkward
as
then
and
it
was
not
strange
that
you
ridiculed
me
so
afterwards
i
frightened
you
and
realised
that
i
continued
to
be
very
unfortunate
in
following
you
even
in
the
visits
you
made
to
the
poor
people
already
i
ceased
to
be
master
of
my
own
actions
and
did
things
that
astonished
me
beyond
measure
and
which
under
usual
circumstances
i
would
not
have
dared
attempt
for
instance
when
i
presented
myself
here
with
the
order
for
a
mitre
i
was
pushed
forward
by
an
involuntary
force
as
personally
i
dared
not
do
it
knowing
that
i
might
make
you
angry
but
at
present
i
can
not
regain
my
old
self
i
can
only
obey
my
impulses
i
know
that
you
do
not
like
me
and
yet
as
you
see
in
spite
of
it
all
i
have
come
back
to
you
that
i
may
hear
you
tell
me
so
if
you
would
but
try
to
understand
how
miserable
i
am
do
not
love
me
if
it
is
not
in
your
heart
to
do
so
i
must
accept
my
fate
but
at
least
allow
me
to
love
you
be
as
cold
as
you
please
be
hateful
if
you
will
i
shall
adore
you
whatever
you
may
choose
to
be
i
only
ask
to
be
able
to
see
you
even
without
any
hope
merely
for
the
joy
of
living
thus
at
your
felicien
stopped
disheartened
losing
all
courage
as
he
thought
he
would
never
find
any
way
of
touching
her
heart
and
he
did
not
see
that
angelique
smiled
half
hidden
as
she
was
by
the
open
it
was
an
invincible
smile
that
little
by
little
spread
over
her
whole
face
ah
the
dear
fellow
how
simple
and
trusting
he
was
as
he
outpoured
the
prayer
of
his
heart
filled
with
new
longings
and
love
in
bowing
before
her
as
before
the
highest
ideal
of
all
his
youthful
dreams
to
think
that
she
had
ever
been
so
foolish
as
at
first
to
try
to
avoid
all
meetings
with
him
and
then
later
on
had
determined
that
although
she
could
not
help
loving
him
he
should
never
know
it
such
folly
on
her
part
was
quite
inexplicable
since
love
is
right
and
is
the
fate
of
all
what
good
could
be
gained
by
making
martyrs
of
them
both
a
complete
silence
ensued
and
in
her
enthusiastic
imaginative
nervous
state
she
heard
louder
than
ever
in
the
quiet
of
the
warm
night
the
voices
of
the
saints
about
her
who
said
love
was
never
forbidden
when
it
was
so
ardent
and
true
as
this
behind
her
back
a
bright
flash
of
light
had
suddenly
appeared
scarcely
a
breath
but
a
delicate
wave
from
the
moon
upon
the
chamber
floor
an
invisible
finger
no
doubt
that
of
her
guardian
angel
was
placed
upon
her
mouth
as
if
to
unseal
her
lips
and
relieve
her
from
her
vow
henceforth
she
could
freely
unburden
herself
and
tell
the
truth
all
that
which
was
powerful
and
tender
in
her
surroundings
now
whispered
to
her
words
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
infinite
unknown
then
at
last
angelique
spoke
ah
yes
i
recollect
i
recollect
it
and
felicien
was
at
once
carried
away
with
delight
by
the
music
of
this
voice
whose
extreme
charm
was
so
great
over
him
that
his
love
seemed
to
increase
simply
from
listening
to
it
yes
i
remember
well
when
you
came
in
the
night
you
were
so
far
away
those
first
evenings
that
the
little
sound
you
made
in
walking
left
me
in
quite
an
uncertain
state
at
last
i
realised
perfectly
that
it
was
you
who
approached
me
and
a
little
later
i
recognised
your
shadow
at
length
one
evening
you
showed
yourself
boldly
on
a
beautiful
bright
night
like
this
in
the
full
white
light
of
the
moon
you
came
out
so
slowly
from
the
inanimate
objects
near
you
like
a
creation
from
all
the
mysteries
that
surrounded
me
exactly
as
i
had
expected
to
see
you
for
a
long
time
and
punctual
to
the
meeting
i
have
never
forgotten
the
great
desire
to
laugh
which
i
kept
back
but
which
broke
forth
in
spite
of
me
when
you
saved
the
linen
that
was
being
carried
away
by
the
chevrotte
i
recollect
my
anger
when
you
robbed
me
of
my
poor
people
by
giving
them
so
much
money
and
thus
making
me
appear
as
a
miser
i
can
still
recall
my
fear
on
the
evening
when
you
forced
me
to
run
so
fast
through
the
grass
with
my
bare
feet
oh
yes
i
have
not
forgotten
anything
not
the
slightest
at
this
last
sentence
her
voice
pure
and
crystalline
was
a
little
broken
by
the
thought
of
those
magic
words
of
the
young
man
the
power
of
which
she
felt
so
deeply
when
he
said
i
love
you
and
a
deep
blush
passed
over
her
face
and
he
he
listened
to
her
with
delight
it
is
indeed
true
that
i
did
wrong
to
tease
you
when
one
is
ignorant
one
is
often
so
foolish
one
does
many
things
which
seem
necessary
simply
from
the
fear
of
being
found
fault
with
if
following
the
impulses
of
the
heart
but
my
remorse
for
all
this
was
deep
and
my
sufferings
in
consequence
were
as
great
as
yours
were
i
to
try
to
explain
all
this
to
you
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
when
you
came
to
us
with
your
drawing
of
saint
agnes
oh
i
could
have
cried
out
thank
you
thank
you
i
was
perfectly
enchanted
to
work
for
you
as
i
thought
you
would
certainly
make
us
a
daily
visit
and
yet
think
of
it
i
pretended
to
be
indifferent
as
if
i
had
taken
upon
myself
the
task
of
doing
all
in
my
power
to
drive
you
from
the
house
has
one
ever
the
need
of
being
willfully
unhappy
whilst
in
reality
i
longed
to
welcome
you
and
to
receive
you
with
open
hands
there
seemed
to
be
in
the
depths
of
my
nature
another
woman
than
myself
who
revolted
who
was
afraid
of
and
mistrusted
you
whose
delight
it
was
to
torture
you
with
uncertainty
in
the
vague
idea
of
setting
up
a
quarrel
the
cause
of
which
in
a
time
long
passed
had
been
quite
forgotten
i
am
not
always
good
often
in
my
soul
things
seem
to
creep
up
that
i
can
not
explain
or
account
for
the
worst
of
it
was
that
i
dared
to
speak
to
you
of
money
fancy
it
then
of
money
i
who
have
never
thought
of
it
who
would
accept
chariots
of
it
only
for
the
pleasure
of
making
it
rain
down
as
i
wished
among
the
needy
what
a
malicious
amusement
i
gave
myself
in
this
calumniating
my
character
will
you
ever
forgive
me
chapter
ix
felicien
was
at
her
feet
until
now
he
had
kept
his
place
in
the
remote
corner
of
the
balcony
but
in
the
intense
happiness
she
gave
him
in
thus
unfolding
the
innermost
secrets
of
her
soul
he
had
drawn
himself
on
his
knees
towards
her
as
he
approached
the
window
this
great
illimitable
joy
was
so
unlooked
for
that
he
yielded
to
it
in
all
the
infinitude
of
its
hopes
of
the
future
he
half
whispered
ah
dear
soul
pure
kind
and
beautiful
your
wonderful
goodness
has
cured
me
as
with
a
breath
i
know
not
now
if
i
have
ever
suffered
and
in
your
turn
you
will
now
have
to
pardon
me
for
i
have
an
acknowledgment
to
make
to
you
i
must
tell
you
who
i
he
was
troubled
at
the
thought
he
could
no
longer
disguise
himself
or
his
position
since
she
had
confided
so
freely
and
entirely
in
him
it
would
be
disloyal
in
the
highest
degree
to
do
so
yet
he
hesitated
lest
he
might
after
all
lose
her
were
she
to
be
anxious
about
the
future
when
at
last
she
knew
the
facts
and
she
waited
for
him
to
speak
again
a
little
malicious
in
spite
of
herself
in
a
very
low
voice
he
continued
i
have
told
a
falsehood
to
your
yes
i
know
it
she
said
as
she
smiled
no
you
do
not
know
it
you
could
not
possibly
know
it
for
all
that
happened
too
long
ago
i
only
paint
on
glass
for
my
own
pleasure
and
as
a
simple
amusement
you
really
ought
to
be
told
of
then
with
a
quick
movement
she
put
her
hand
on
his
mouth
as
if
she
wished
to
prevent
this
explanation
i
do
not
care
to
hear
any
more
i
have
been
expecting
you
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
you
would
come
and
you
have
done
so
that
is
they
talked
no
longer
for
a
while
that
little
hand
over
his
lips
seemed
almost
too
great
a
happiness
for
him
when
the
right
time
comes
then
i
shall
know
all
yet
i
assure
you
that
i
am
ignorant
of
nothing
connected
with
you
for
everything
had
been
revealed
to
me
before
our
first
meeting
you
were
to
be
and
can
be
only
the
handsomest
the
richest
and
the
most
noble
of
men
the
one
above
all
others
for
that
has
ever
been
my
dream
and
in
the
sure
certainty
of
its
full
accomplishment
i
wait
calmly
you
are
the
chosen
hero
who
it
was
ordained
should
come
and
i
am
a
second
time
she
interrupted
herself
in
the
tremor
of
the
words
she
pronounced
she
did
not
appear
to
say
them
by
herself
alone
they
came
to
her
as
if
sent
by
the
beautiful
night
from
the
great
white
heavens
from
the
old
trees
and
the
aged
stones
sleeping
outside
and
dreaming
aloud
the
fancies
of
the
young
girl
from
behind
her
voices
also
whispered
them
to
her
the
voices
of
her
friends
in
the
golden
legend
with
whom
she
had
peopled
the
air
and
the
space
around
her
in
this
atmosphere
she
had
ever
lived
mysticism
in
which
she
revelled
until
it
seemed
fact
on
one
side
and
the
daily
work
of
life
on
the
other
nothing
seemed
strange
to
her
now
but
one
word
remained
to
be
said
that
which
would
express
all
the
long
waiting
the
slow
creation
of
affection
the
constantly
increasing
fever
of
restlessness
it
escaped
from
her
lips
like
a
cry
from
a
distance
from
the
white
flight
of
a
bird
mounting
upward
in
the
light
of
the
early
dawn
in
the
pure
whiteness
of
the
chamber
behind
her
i
love
angelique
her
two
hands
spread
out
bent
forward
towards
felicien
and
he
recalled
to
himself
the
evening
when
she
ran
barefooted
through
the
grass
making
so
adorable
a
picture
that
he
pursued
her
in
order
to
stammer
in
her
ear
these
same
words
i
love
he
knew
that
now
she
was
simply
replying
to
him
with
the
same
cry
of
affection
the
eternal
cry
which
at
last
came
from
her
heart
yes
i
love
you
i
am
yours
lead
the
way
and
i
will
follow
you
wherever
it
may
in
this
surrender
of
her
soul
she
gave
herself
to
him
fully
and
entirely
it
was
the
hereditary
flame
relighted
within
her
the
pride
and
the
passion
she
thought
had
been
conquered
but
which
awoke
at
the
wish
of
her
beloved
he
trembled
before
this
innocence
so
ardent
and
so
ingenuous
he
took
her
hands
gently
and
crossed
them
upon
her
breast
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
her
radiant
with
the
intense
happiness
her
confession
had
given
him
unwilling
to
wound
her
delicacy
in
the
slightest
degree
and
not
thinking
of
yielding
to
the
temptation
of
even
kissing
her
hair
you
love
me
and
you
know
that
i
love
you
ah
what
bliss
there
is
in
such
but
they
were
suddenly
drawn
from
their
ecstatic
state
by
a
change
about
them
what
did
it
all
mean
they
realised
that
now
they
were
looking
at
each
other
under
a
great
white
light
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
the
brightness
of
the
moon
had
been
increased
and
was
as
resplendent
as
that
of
the
sun
it
was
in
reality
the
daybreak
a
slight
shade
of
which
already
tinged
with
purple
the
tops
of
the
in
the
neighbouring
gardens
what
it
could
not
be
possible
that
the
dawn
had
come
they
were
astonished
by
it
for
they
did
not
realise
so
long
a
time
had
passed
since
they
began
to
talk
together
on
the
balcony
she
had
as
yet
told
him
nothing
and
he
had
so
many
things
he
wished
to
say
oh
stay
one
minute
more
only
one
minute
he
exclaimed
the
daylight
advanced
still
faster
the
smiling
morning
already
warm
of
what
was
to
be
a
hot
day
in
summer
one
by
one
the
stars
were
extinguished
and
with
them
fled
the
wandering
visions
and
all
the
host
of
invisible
friends
seemed
to
mount
upward
and
to
glide
away
on
the
moon
s
rays
now
in
the
full
clear
light
the
room
behind
them
had
only
its
ordinary
whiteness
of
walls
and
ceiling
and
seemed
quite
empty
with
its
furniture
of
dark
oak
the
velvet
hangings
were
no
longer
there
and
the
bedstead
had
resumed
its
original
shape
as
it
stood
half
hidden
by
the
falling
of
one
of
its
curtains
do
stay
let
me
be
near
you
only
one
minute
more
angelique
having
risen
refused
and
begged
felicien
to
leave
immediately
since
the
day
had
come
she
had
grown
confused
and
anxious
the
reality
was
now
here
at
her
right
hand
she
seemed
to
hear
a
delicate
movement
of
wings
whilst
her
hair
was
gently
blown
although
there
was
not
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
was
it
not
saint
agnes
who
having
remained
until
the
last
was
now
forced
to
leave
driven
away
by
the
sun
no
leave
me
i
beg
of
you
i
am
unwilling
you
should
stay
then
felicien
obedient
withdrew
to
know
that
he
was
beloved
was
enough
for
him
and
satisfied
him
still
before
leaving
the
balcony
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
again
fixedly
as
if
he
wished
to
carry
away
with
him
an
indelible
remembrance
of
her
they
both
smiled
at
each
other
as
they
stood
thus
bathed
with
light
in
this
long
caressing
look
at
last
he
said
i
love
and
she
gently
replied
i
love
that
was
all
and
he
had
in
a
moment
with
the
agility
of
a
bird
gone
down
the
woodwork
of
the
corner
of
the
building
while
she
remaining
on
the
balcony
leaned
on
the
balustrade
and
watched
him
with
her
tender
beautiful
eyes
she
had
taken
the
bouquet
of
violets
and
breathed
the
perfume
to
cool
her
feverishness
when
in
crossing
the
he
lifted
his
head
he
saw
that
she
was
kissing
the
flowers
scarcely
had
felicien
disappeared
behind
the
willows
when
angelique
was
disturbed
by
hearing
below
the
opening
of
the
four
o
clock
had
just
struck
and
no
one
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
up
until
two
hours
later
her
surprise
increased
when
she
recognised
hubertine
as
it
was
always
hubert
who
went
down
the
first
she
saw
her
follow
slowly
the
walks
of
the
narrow
garden
her
arms
hanging
listlessly
at
her
sides
as
if
after
a
restless
sleepless
night
a
feeling
of
suffocating
a
need
of
breathing
the
fresh
air
had
made
her
leave
her
room
so
early
and
hubertine
was
really
very
beautiful
with
her
clothes
so
hastily
put
on
and
she
seemed
very
weary
happy
but
in
the
deepest
grief
the
morning
of
the
next
day
on
waking
from
a
sound
sleep
of
eight
hours
one
of
those
sweet
deep
refreshing
sleeps
that
come
after
some
great
happiness
angelique
ran
to
her
window
the
sky
was
clear
the
air
pure
and
the
fine
weather
had
returned
after
a
heavy
shower
of
the
previous
evening
delighted
she
called
out
joyously
to
hubert
who
was
just
opening
the
blinds
below
her
father
father
do
look
at
the
beautiful
sunlight
oh
how
glad
i
am
for
the
procession
will
be
superb
dressing
herself
as
quickly
as
possible
she
hurried
to
go
downstairs
it
was
on
that
day
july
that
the
procession
of
the
miracle
would
pass
through
the
streets
of
the
upper
town
every
summer
at
this
date
it
was
also
a
festival
for
the
embroiderers
all
work
was
put
aside
no
needles
were
threaded
but
the
day
was
passed
in
ornamenting
the
house
after
a
traditional
arrangement
that
had
been
transmitted
from
mother
to
daughter
for
four
hundred
years
all
the
while
that
she
was
taking
her
coffee
angelique
talked
of
the
hangings
mother
we
must
look
at
them
at
once
to
see
if
they
are
in
good
we
have
plenty
of
time
before
us
my
dear
replied
hubertine
in
her
quiet
way
we
shall
not
put
them
up
until
the
decorations
in
question
consisted
of
three
large
panels
of
the
most
admirable
ancient
embroidery
which
the
huberts
guarded
with
the
greatest
care
as
a
sacred
family
relic
and
which
they
brought
out
once
a
year
on
the
occasion
of
the
passing
of
this
special
procession
the
previous
evening
according
to
a
custom
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
the
good
abbe
cornille
had
gone
from
door
to
door
to
notify
the
inhabitants
of
the
route
which
would
be
taken
by
the
bearers
of
the
statue
of
saint
agnes
accompanied
by
monseigneur
the
bishop
carrying
the
holy
sacrament
for
more
than
five
centuries
this
route
had
been
the
same
the
departure
was
made
from
the
portal
of
saint
agnes
then
by
the
rue
des
orfevres
to
the
grand
rue
to
the
rue
basse
and
after
having
gone
through
the
whole
of
the
lower
town
it
returned
by
the
rue
magloire
and
the
place
du
cloitre
to
reappear
again
at
the
great
front
entrance
of
the
church
and
the
dwellers
on
all
these
streets
vying
with
each
other
in
their
zeal
decorated
their
windows
hung
upon
their
walls
their
richest
possessions
in
silks
satins
velvets
or
tapestry
and
strewed
the
pavements
with
flowers
particularly
with
the
leaves
of
roses
and
carnations
angelique
was
very
impatient
until
permission
had
been
given
her
to
take
from
the
drawers
where
they
had
been
quietly
resting
for
the
past
twelve
months
the
three
pieces
of
embroidery
they
are
in
perfect
order
mother
nothing
has
happened
to
them
she
said
as
she
looked
at
them
enraptured
she
had
with
the
greatest
care
removed
the
mass
of
silk
paper
that
protected
them
from
the
dust
and
they
now
appeared
in
all
their
beauty
the
three
were
consecrated
to
mary
the
blessed
virgin
receiving
the
visit
of
the
angel
of
the
annunciation
the
virgin
mother
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
and
the
assumption
of
the
virgin
they
were
made
in
the
fifteenth
century
of
brightly
coloured
silks
wrought
on
a
golden
background
and
were
wonderfully
well
preserved
the
family
had
always
refused
to
sell
them
although
very
large
sums
had
been
offered
by
different
churches
and
they
were
justly
proud
of
their
possessions
mother
dear
may
i
not
hang
them
up
all
these
preparations
required
a
great
deal
of
time
hubert
was
occupied
the
whole
forenoon
in
cleaning
the
front
of
the
old
building
he
fastened
a
broom
to
the
end
of
a
long
stick
that
he
might
dust
all
the
wooden
panels
decorated
with
bricks
as
far
as
the
framework
of
the
roof
then
with
a
sponge
he
washed
all
the
of
stone
and
all
the
parts
of
the
stairway
tower
that
he
could
reach
when
that
was
finished
the
three
superb
pieces
of
embroidery
were
put
in
their
places
angelique
attached
them
by
their
rings
to
venerable
nails
that
were
in
the
walls
the
annunciation
below
the
window
at
the
left
the
assumption
below
the
window
at
the
right
while
for
the
calvary
the
nails
for
that
were
above
the
great
window
of
the
first
story
and
she
was
obliged
to
use
a
that
she
might
hang
it
there
in
its
turn
she
had
already
embellished
the
window
with
flowers
so
that
the
ancient
dwelling
seemed
to
have
gone
back
to
the
time
of
its
youth
with
its
embroideries
of
gold
and
of
silk
glistening
in
the
beautiful
sunshine
of
this
festive
day
after
the
noon
breakfast
the
activity
increased
in
every
direction
and
the
whole
rue
des
orfevres
was
now
in
excitement
to
avoid
the
great
heat
the
procession
would
not
move
until
five
o
clock
but
after
twelve
the
town
began
to
be
decorated
opposite
the
huberts
the
silversmith
dressed
his
shop
with
draperies
of
an
exquisite
light
blue
bordered
with
a
silver
fringe
while
the
who
was
next
to
him
made
use
of
his
of
red
cotton
which
looked
more
brilliant
than
ever
in
the
broad
light
of
day
at
each
house
there
were
different
colours
a
prodigality
of
stuffs
everything
that
people
owned
even
to
rugs
of
all
descriptions
were
blowing
about
in
the
weary
air
of
this
hot
summer
afternoon
the
street
now
seemed
clothed
sparkling
and
almost
trembling
with
gaiety
as
if
changed
into
a
gallery
of
fete
open
to
the
sky
all
its
inhabitants
were
rushing
to
and
fro
pushing
against
each
other
speaking
loud
as
if
in
their
own
homes
some
of
them
carrying
their
arms
full
of
objects
others
climbing
driving
nails
and
calling
vociferously
in
addition
to
all
this
was
the
or
altar
that
was
being
prepared
at
the
corner
of
the
grand
rue
the
arrangements
for
which
called
for
the
services
of
all
the
women
of
the
neighbourhood
who
eagerly
offered
their
vases
and
candlesticks
angelique
ran
down
to
carry
the
two
candelabra
of
the
style
of
the
empire
which
they
had
on
the
of
their
parlour
she
had
not
taken
a
moment
s
rest
since
the
early
morning
but
had
shown
no
signs
of
fatigue
being
on
the
contrary
supported
and
carried
above
herself
by
her
great
inward
happiness
and
as
she
came
back
from
her
errand
her
hair
blown
all
about
her
face
by
the
wind
hubert
began
to
tease
her
as
she
seated
herself
to
strip
off
the
leaves
of
the
roses
and
to
put
them
in
a
great
basket
you
could
not
do
any
more
than
you
have
done
were
it
your
my
dear
is
it
then
that
you
are
really
to
be
married
now
but
yes
oh
yes
why
not
she
answered
gaily
hubertine
smiled
in
her
turn
while
waiting
my
daughter
since
the
house
is
so
satisfactorily
arranged
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
go
upstairs
and
in
a
minute
mother
look
at
my
full
she
had
finished
taking
the
leaves
from
the
roses
which
she
had
reserved
to
throw
before
monseigneur
the
petals
rained
from
her
slender
fingers
the
basket
was
running
over
with
its
light
perfumed
contents
then
as
she
disappeared
on
the
narrow
stairway
of
the
tower
she
said
while
laughing
heartily
we
will
be
quick
i
will
make
myself
beautiful
as
a
star
the
afternoon
advanced
now
the
feverish
movement
in
eglise
was
calmed
a
peculiar
air
of
expectation
seemed
to
fill
the
streets
which
were
all
ready
and
where
everyone
spoke
softly
in
hushed
whispering
voices
the
heat
had
diminished
as
the
sun
s
rays
grew
oblique
and
between
the
houses
so
closely
pressed
the
one
against
the
others
there
fell
from
the
pale
sky
only
a
warm
fine
shadow
of
a
gentle
serene
nature
the
air
of
meditation
was
profound
as
if
the
old
town
had
become
simply
a
continuation
of
the
cathedral
the
only
sound
of
carriages
that
could
be
heard
came
up
from
the
new
town
on
the
banks
of
the
ligneul
where
many
of
the
factories
were
not
closed
as
the
proprietors
disdained
taking
part
in
this
ancient
religious
ceremony
soon
after
four
o
clock
the
great
bell
of
the
northern
tower
the
one
whose
swinging
stirred
the
house
of
the
huberts
began
to
ring
and
it
was
at
that
very
moment
that
hubertine
and
angelique
reappeared
the
former
had
put
on
a
dress
of
pale
buff
linen
trimmed
with
a
simple
thread
lace
but
her
figure
was
so
slight
and
youthful
in
its
delicate
roundness
that
she
looked
as
if
she
were
the
sister
of
her
adopted
daughter
angelique
wore
her
dress
of
white
foulard
with
its
soft
ruchings
at
the
neck
and
wrists
and
nothing
else
neither
earrings
nor
bracelets
only
her
bare
wrists
and
throat
soft
in
their
satiny
whiteness
as
they
came
out
from
the
delicate
material
light
as
the
opening
of
a
flower
an
invisible
comb
put
in
place
hastily
scarcely
held
the
curls
of
her
golden
hair
which
was
carelessly
dressed
she
was
artless
and
proud
of
a
most
touching
simplicity
and
indeed
beautiful
as
a
ah
she
said
the
bell
that
is
to
show
that
monseigneur
has
left
his
the
bell
continued
to
sound
loud
and
clear
in
the
great
purity
of
the
atmosphere
the
huberts
installed
themselves
at
the
window
of
the
first
story
the
mother
and
daughter
being
in
front
with
their
elbows
resting
on
the
bar
of
support
and
the
husband
and
father
standing
behind
them
these
were
their
accustomed
places
they
could
not
possibly
have
found
better
as
they
would
be
the
very
first
to
see
the
procession
as
it
came
from
the
farther
end
of
the
church
without
missing
even
a
single
candle
of
the
where
is
my
basket
asked
angelique
hubert
was
obliged
to
take
and
pass
to
her
the
basket
of
which
she
held
between
her
arms
pressed
against
her
breast
oh
that
bell
she
at
last
murmured
it
seems
as
if
it
would
lull
us
to
sleep
and
still
the
waiting
continued
in
the
little
vibrating
house
sonorous
with
the
musical
movement
the
street
and
the
great
square
waited
subdued
by
this
great
trembling
whist
the
hangings
on
every
side
blew
about
more
quietly
in
the
air
of
the
coming
evening
the
perfume
of
roses
was
very
sweet
another
passed
then
at
the
same
moment
the
two
halves
of
the
portal
of
saint
agnes
were
opened
and
they
perceived
the
very
depths
of
the
church
dark
in
reality
but
dotted
with
little
bright
spots
from
the
tapers
first
the
bearer
of
the
cross
appeared
a
in
a
tunic
accompanied
by
the
acolytes
each
one
of
whom
held
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
behind
them
hurried
along
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
the
good
abbe
cornille
who
after
having
assured
himself
that
everything
was
in
perfect
order
in
the
street
stopped
under
the
porch
and
assisted
a
moment
at
the
passing
out
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
places
assigned
to
each
section
had
been
rightly
taken
the
various
societies
of
laymen
opened
the
march
the
charitable
associations
schools
by
rank
of
seniority
and
numerous
public
organisations
there
were
a
great
many
children
little
girls
all
in
white
like
brides
and
little
bareheaded
boys
with
curly
hair
dressed
in
their
best
like
princes
already
looking
in
every
direction
to
find
where
their
mothers
were
a
splendid
fellow
nine
years
of
age
walked
by
himself
in
the
middle
clad
like
saint
john
the
baptist
with
a
sheepskin
over
his
thin
bare
shoulders
four
little
girls
covered
with
pink
ribbons
bore
a
shield
on
which
was
a
sheaf
of
ripe
wheat
then
there
were
young
girls
grouped
around
a
banner
of
the
blessed
virgin
ladies
in
black
who
also
had
their
special
banner
of
crimson
silk
on
which
was
embroidered
a
portrait
of
saint
joseph
there
were
other
and
still
other
banners
in
velvet
or
in
satin
balanced
at
the
end
of
gilded
batons
the
brotherhoods
of
men
were
no
less
numerous
penitents
of
all
colours
but
especially
the
grey
penitents
in
dark
linen
suits
wearing
cowls
and
whose
emblems
made
a
great
sensation
a
large
cross
with
a
wheel
to
which
were
attached
the
instruments
of
the
passion
angelique
exclaimed
with
tenderness
when
the
children
came
by
oh
the
blessed
darlings
do
look
at
them
all
one
no
higher
than
a
boot
scarcely
three
years
of
age
proudly
tottered
along
on
his
little
feet
and
looked
so
comical
that
she
plunged
her
hands
into
her
basket
and
literally
covered
him
with
flowers
he
quite
disappeared
under
them
for
an
instant
he
had
roses
in
his
hair
and
on
his
shoulders
the
exquisite
little
laughing
shout
he
uttered
was
enjoyed
on
every
side
and
flowers
rained
down
from
all
the
windows
as
the
cherub
passed
in
the
humming
silence
of
the
street
one
could
now
only
hear
the
deafened
sound
of
the
regular
movement
of
feet
in
the
procession
while
flowers
by
the
handful
still
continued
to
fall
silently
upon
the
pavement
very
soon
there
were
heaps
of
them
but
now
reassured
upon
the
good
order
of
the
laymen
the
abbe
cornille
grew
impatient
and
disturbed
inasmuch
as
the
procession
had
been
stationary
for
nearly
two
minutes
and
he
walked
quickly
towards
the
head
of
it
bowing
and
smiling
at
the
huberts
as
he
passed
what
has
happened
what
can
prevent
them
from
continuing
said
angelique
all
feverish
from
excitement
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
some
expected
happiness
that
was
to
come
to
her
from
the
other
end
that
was
still
in
the
church
hubertine
answered
her
gently
as
usual
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
there
is
some
obstruction
evidently
perhaps
it
is
a
that
is
still
unfinished
hubert
added
the
young
girls
of
the
society
of
the
blessed
virgin
the
daughters
of
mary
as
they
are
called
had
already
commenced
singing
a
canticle
and
their
clear
voices
rose
in
the
air
pure
as
crystal
nearer
and
nearer
the
double
ranks
caught
the
movement
and
recommenced
their
march
chapter
x
after
the
civilians
the
clergy
began
to
leave
the
church
the
lower
orders
coming
first
all
in
surplices
covered
their
heads
with
their
caps
under
the
porch
and
each
one
held
a
large
lighted
wax
taper
those
at
the
right
in
their
right
hand
and
those
at
the
left
in
their
left
hand
outside
the
rank
so
there
was
a
double
row
of
flame
almost
deadened
by
the
brightness
of
the
day
first
were
representatives
from
the
great
seminaries
the
parishes
and
then
collegiate
churches
then
came
the
beneficed
clergymen
and
clerks
of
the
cathedral
followed
by
the
canons
in
white
pluvials
in
their
midst
were
the
choristers
in
capes
of
red
silk
who
chanted
the
anthem
in
full
voice
and
to
whom
all
the
clergy
replied
in
lower
notes
the
hymn
pange
lingua
was
grandly
given
the
street
was
now
filled
with
a
rustling
of
muslin
from
the
flying
winged
sleeves
of
the
surplices
which
seemed
pierced
all
over
with
tiny
stars
of
pale
gold
from
the
flames
of
the
candles
oh
at
last
angelique
half
sighed
there
is
saint
agnes
she
smiled
at
the
saint
borne
by
four
clerks
in
white
surplices
on
a
platform
of
white
velvet
heavily
ornamented
with
lace
each
year
it
was
like
a
new
surprise
to
her
as
she
saw
her
guardian
angel
thus
brought
out
from
the
shadows
where
she
had
been
growing
old
for
centuries
quite
like
another
person
under
the
brilliant
sunshine
as
if
she
were
timid
and
blushing
in
her
robe
of
long
golden
hair
she
was
really
so
old
yet
still
very
young
with
her
small
hands
her
little
slender
feet
her
delicate
girlish
face
blackened
by
time
but
monseigneur
was
to
follow
her
already
the
swinging
of
the
censers
could
be
heard
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
church
there
was
a
slight
murmuring
of
voices
as
angelique
repeated
monseigneur
monseigneur
and
with
her
eyes
still
upon
the
saint
who
was
going
by
she
recalled
to
mind
at
this
moment
the
old
histories
the
noble
marquesses
d
hautecoeur
delivering
beaumont
from
the
plague
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
agnes
then
jean
v
and
all
those
of
his
race
coming
to
kneel
before
her
image
to
pay
their
devotions
to
the
saint
and
she
seemed
to
see
them
all
the
lords
of
the
miracle
coming
one
by
one
like
a
line
of
princes
a
large
space
had
been
left
empty
then
the
chaplain
charged
with
the
care
of
the
crozier
advanced
holding
it
erect
the
curved
part
being
towards
him
afterward
came
two
who
walked
backwards
and
swung
the
censers
gently
from
side
to
side
each
one
having
near
him
an
acolyte
charged
with
the
there
was
a
little
difficulty
before
they
succeeded
in
passing
by
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
door
the
great
canopy
of
royal
scarlet
velvet
decorated
with
a
heavy
fringe
of
gold
but
the
delay
was
short
order
was
quickly
and
the
designated
officials
took
the
supports
in
hand
underneath
between
his
deacons
of
honour
monseigneur
walked
bareheaded
his
shoulders
covered
with
a
white
scarf
the
two
ends
of
which
enveloped
his
hands
which
bore
the
holy
sacrament
as
high
as
possible
and
without
touching
it
immediately
the
resumed
their
places
and
the
censers
sent
out
in
haste
fell
back
again
in
unison
with
the
little
silvery
sound
of
their
chains
but
angelique
started
as
she
thought
where
had
she
ever
seen
anyone
who
looked
like
monseigneur
she
certainly
knew
his
face
before
but
had
never
been
struck
by
it
as
all
heads
were
bowed
in
solemn
devotion
but
she
was
so
uneasy
she
simply
bent
down
and
looked
at
him
he
was
tall
slight
and
superb
in
his
physical
strength
notwithstanding
his
sixty
years
his
eyes
were
piercing
as
those
of
an
eagle
his
nose
a
little
prominent
only
seemed
to
increase
the
sovereign
authority
of
his
face
which
was
somewhat
softened
by
his
white
hair
that
was
thick
and
curly
she
noticed
the
pallor
of
his
complexion
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
he
suddenly
flushed
from
some
unknown
reason
perhaps
however
it
was
simply
a
reflection
from
the
great
sun
which
he
carried
in
his
covered
hands
and
which
placed
him
in
a
radiance
of
mystic
light
certainly
he
made
her
think
of
someone
but
of
whom
as
soon
as
he
left
the
church
monseigneur
had
commenced
a
psalm
which
he
recited
in
a
low
voice
alternating
the
verses
thereof
with
his
deacons
and
angelique
trembled
when
she
saw
him
turn
his
eyes
towards
their
window
for
he
seemed
to
her
so
severe
so
haughty
and
so
cold
as
if
he
were
condemning
the
vanity
of
all
earthly
affection
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
three
bands
of
ancient
embroidery
mary
and
the
angel
mary
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
mary
being
borne
to
heaven
and
his
face
brightened
then
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
her
but
she
was
so
disturbed
she
could
not
tell
whether
his
glance
was
harsh
or
gentle
at
all
events
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
quickly
regarding
the
holy
sacrament
his
expression
was
lost
in
the
light
which
came
from
the
great
golden
vessel
the
censers
still
swung
back
and
forth
with
a
measured
rhythm
while
a
little
blue
cloud
mounted
in
the
air
but
angelique
s
heart
now
beat
so
rapidly
she
could
scarcely
keep
still
behind
the
canopy
she
had
just
seen
a
chaplain
his
fingers
covered
with
a
scarf
who
was
carrying
the
mitre
as
devoutly
as
if
it
were
a
sacred
object
saint
agnes
flying
heavenward
with
the
two
angels
the
work
of
her
hands
and
into
each
stitch
of
which
she
had
put
such
deep
love
then
among
the
laymen
who
followed
in
the
midst
of
functionaries
of
officers
of
magistrates
she
recognised
felicien
in
the
front
rank
slight
and
graceful
with
his
curly
hair
his
rather
large
but
straight
nose
and
his
black
eyes
the
expression
of
which
was
at
the
same
time
proud
and
gentle
she
expected
him
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
find
him
transformed
into
a
prince
her
heart
simply
was
overflowing
with
joy
to
the
anxious
look
which
he
gave
her
as
of
imploring
forgiveness
for
his
falsehood
she
replied
by
a
lovely
smile
but
look
exclaimed
hubertine
astonished
at
what
she
saw
is
not
that
the
young
man
who
came
to
our
house
about
the
mitre
she
had
also
recognised
him
and
was
much
disturbed
when
turning
towards
the
young
girl
she
saw
the
latter
transfigured
in
ecstacy
avoiding
a
reply
then
he
did
not
tell
us
the
truth
about
himself
but
why
do
you
know
the
reason
tell
me
my
dear
do
you
know
who
this
young
man
is
yes
perhaps
in
reality
she
did
know
an
inner
voice
answered
all
these
questions
but
she
dared
not
speak
she
was
unwilling
to
ask
herself
anything
at
the
right
time
and
at
the
proper
place
the
truth
would
be
made
clear
she
thought
it
was
approaching
and
felt
an
increase
of
pride
of
spirit
and
of
great
love
but
what
is
it
what
has
happened
asked
hubert
as
he
bent
forward
and
touched
the
shoulder
of
his
wife
he
was
never
present
at
the
moment
of
an
occurrence
but
always
appeared
to
come
from
a
reverie
to
the
realisation
of
what
passed
about
him
when
the
young
man
was
pointed
out
to
him
he
did
not
recognise
him
at
all
is
it
he
i
think
not
no
you
must
be
mistaken
it
is
not
then
hubertine
acknowledged
that
she
was
not
quite
sure
at
all
events
it
was
as
well
to
talk
no
more
about
it
but
she
would
inform
herself
later
on
but
the
procession
which
had
stopped
again
in
order
that
monseigneur
might
incense
the
holy
sacrament
which
was
placed
among
the
verdure
of
a
temporary
altar
at
the
corner
of
the
street
was
now
about
to
move
on
again
and
angelique
whose
hands
seemed
lost
in
the
basket
on
her
lap
suddenly
in
her
delight
and
confusion
made
a
quick
movement
and
carelessly
threw
out
a
great
quantity
of
the
perfumed
petals
at
that
instant
felicien
approached
the
leaves
fell
like
a
little
shower
and
at
last
two
of
them
fluttered
balanced
themselves
then
quietly
settled
down
on
his
hair
it
was
over
the
canopy
had
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
grand
rue
the
end
of
the
cortege
went
by
leaving
the
pavements
deserted
hushed
as
if
quieted
by
a
dreamy
faith
in
the
rather
strong
exhalation
of
crushed
roses
yet
one
could
still
hear
in
the
distance
growing
weaker
and
weaker
by
degrees
the
silvery
sound
of
the
little
chains
of
the
swinging
censers
oh
mother
said
angelique
pleadingly
do
let
us
go
into
the
church
so
as
to
see
them
all
as
they
come
hubertine
s
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
but
she
for
her
own
part
was
very
anxious
to
ascertain
what
she
could
about
felicien
so
she
replied
yes
after
a
while
if
you
really
wish
to
do
but
they
must
of
course
wait
a
little
angelique
after
going
to
her
room
for
her
hat
could
not
keep
still
she
returned
every
minute
to
the
great
window
which
was
still
wide
open
she
looked
to
the
end
of
the
street
inquiringly
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
as
if
seeking
something
in
space
itself
and
so
nervous
was
she
that
she
spoke
aloud
as
she
mentally
followed
the
procession
step
by
step
now
they
are
going
down
the
rue
basse
ah
see
they
must
be
turning
on
the
square
before
the
sous
prefecture
there
is
no
end
to
all
the
long
streets
in
what
pleasure
can
they
take
in
seeing
saint
agnes
i
would
like
to
know
all
these
petty
tradesmen
above
them
in
the
heavens
was
a
delicately
cloud
with
a
band
of
white
and
gold
around
it
and
it
seemed
as
if
from
it
there
came
a
devotional
peace
and
a
hush
of
religious
expectation
in
the
immobility
of
the
air
one
realised
that
all
civil
life
was
suspended
as
if
god
had
left
his
house
and
everyone
was
awaiting
his
return
before
resuming
their
daily
occupations
opposite
them
the
blue
draperies
of
the
silversmith
and
the
red
curtains
of
the
still
barred
the
interior
of
their
shops
and
hid
the
contents
from
view
the
streets
seemed
empty
there
was
no
reverberation
from
one
to
the
other
except
that
of
the
slow
march
of
the
clergy
whose
progress
could
easily
be
realised
from
every
corner
of
the
town
mother
mother
i
assure
you
that
now
they
are
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
magloire
they
will
soon
come
up
the
she
was
mistaken
for
it
was
only
six
and
the
procession
never
came
back
before
a
seven
she
should
have
known
well
had
she
not
been
that
the
canopy
must
be
only
at
the
lower
wharf
of
the
ligneul
but
she
was
too
excited
to
think
oh
mother
dear
hurry
or
we
may
not
find
any
come
make
haste
then
little
one
at
last
hubertine
said
smiling
in
spite
of
herself
we
shall
certainly
be
obliged
to
wait
a
great
while
but
never
as
for
me
i
will
remain
at
home
said
hubert
i
can
take
down
and
put
away
the
embroidered
panels
and
then
i
will
set
the
table
for
the
church
seemed
empty
to
them
as
the
blessed
sacrament
was
no
longer
there
all
the
doors
were
wide
open
like
those
of
a
house
in
complete
disorder
where
one
is
awaiting
the
return
of
the
master
very
few
persons
came
in
the
great
altar
alone
a
sarcophagus
of
severe
romanesque
style
glittered
as
if
burning
at
the
end
of
the
nave
covered
as
it
was
with
stars
from
the
flame
of
many
candles
all
the
rest
of
the
enormous
building
the
aisles
the
chapels
and
the
arches
seemed
filled
with
shadow
under
the
of
the
evening
darkness
slowly
in
order
to
gain
a
little
patience
angelique
and
hubertine
walked
round
the
edifice
low
down
it
seemed
as
if
crushed
thickset
columns
supported
the
semicircular
arches
of
the
they
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
dark
chapels
which
were
buried
almost
as
if
they
were
crypts
then
when
they
crossed
over
before
the
great
entrance
portal
under
the
triforium
of
the
organ
they
had
a
feeling
of
deliverance
as
they
raised
their
eyes
towards
the
high
gothic
windows
of
the
nave
which
shot
up
so
gracefully
above
the
heavy
romanesque
coursed
work
but
they
continued
by
the
southern
and
the
feeling
of
suffocation
returned
again
at
the
cross
of
the
transept
four
enormous
pillars
made
the
four
corners
and
rose
to
a
great
height
then
struck
off
to
support
the
roof
there
was
still
to
be
found
a
delicate
light
the
farewell
of
the
day
through
the
rose
windows
of
the
side
fronts
they
had
crossed
the
three
steps
which
led
to
the
choir
then
they
turned
by
the
circumference
of
the
apse
which
was
the
very
oldest
part
of
the
building
and
seemed
most
sepulchral
they
stopped
one
moment
and
leaned
against
the
ancient
grating
which
entirely
surrounded
the
choir
and
which
was
most
elaborately
wrought
that
they
might
look
at
the
flaming
altar
where
each
separate
light
was
reflected
in
the
old
polished
oak
of
the
stalls
most
marvellous
stalls
covered
with
rare
sculptures
so
at
last
they
came
back
to
the
point
from
which
they
started
lifting
up
their
heads
as
if
they
breathed
more
freely
from
the
heights
of
the
nave
which
the
growing
shades
at
night
drove
farther
away
and
enlarged
the
old
walls
on
which
were
faint
remains
of
paintings
and
of
gold
i
know
perfectly
well
that
we
are
altogether
too
early
said
hubertine
angelique
without
replying
said
as
if
to
herself
how
grand
it
is
it
really
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
never
known
the
church
before
but
that
she
had
just
seen
it
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
motionless
sea
of
chairs
then
went
to
the
depth
of
the
chapels
where
she
could
only
imagine
were
tombs
and
old
funereal
stones
on
account
of
the
increased
darkness
therein
but
she
saw
at
last
the
chapel
hautecoeur
where
she
recognised
the
window
that
had
been
repaired
with
its
saint
george
that
now
looked
vague
as
a
dream
in
the
dusk
she
was
unusually
happy
at
last
there
was
a
gentle
shaking
through
the
whole
building
and
the
great
clock
struck
then
the
bell
began
to
ring
ah
now
she
said
look
for
they
are
really
coming
up
the
rue
this
time
it
was
indeed
so
a
crowd
invaded
the
church
the
aisles
were
soon
filled
and
one
realised
that
each
minute
the
procession
approached
nearer
and
nearer
the
noise
increased
with
the
pealing
of
the
bells
with
a
certain
rushing
movement
of
air
by
the
great
entrance
the
portal
of
which
was
wide
open
angelique
leaning
on
hubertine
s
shoulder
made
herself
as
tall
as
possible
by
standing
upon
the
points
of
her
feet
as
she
looked
towards
this
arched
open
space
the
roundness
of
whose
top
was
perfectly
defined
in
the
pale
twilight
of
the
place
du
cloitre
the
first
to
appear
was
of
course
the
bearer
of
the
cross
accompanied
by
his
two
acolytes
with
their
candelabra
and
behind
them
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
hurried
along
the
good
abbe
cornille
who
now
seemed
quite
out
of
breath
and
overcome
by
fatigue
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
the
silhouette
of
each
new
arrival
was
thrown
out
for
a
second
clear
and
strong
then
passed
quickly
away
in
the
darkness
of
the
interior
there
were
the
laymen
the
schools
the
associations
the
fraternities
whose
banners
like
sails
wavered
for
an
instant
then
suddenly
vanished
in
the
shade
one
saw
again
the
pale
daughters
of
mary
who
as
they
entered
still
sang
with
their
voices
like
those
of
seraphim
the
cathedral
had
room
for
all
the
nave
was
slowly
filled
the
men
being
at
the
right
and
the
women
at
the
left
but
night
had
come
the
whole
place
outside
was
dotted
with
bright
points
hundreds
of
moving
lights
and
soon
it
was
the
turn
for
the
clergy
the
tapers
that
were
held
outside
the
ranks
making
a
double
yellow
cord
as
they
passed
through
the
door
the
tapers
seemed
endless
as
they
succeeded
each
other
and
multiplied
themselves
the
great
seminary
the
parishes
and
the
cathedral
the
choristers
still
singing
the
anthem
and
the
canons
in
their
white
pluvials
then
little
by
little
the
church
became
lighted
up
seemed
inhabited
illuminated
overpowered
by
hundreds
of
stars
like
a
summer
sky
two
chairs
being
unoccupied
angelique
stood
upon
one
of
them
get
down
my
dear
whispered
hubertine
for
that
is
but
she
tranquilly
remained
there
and
did
not
move
why
is
it
forbidden
i
must
see
at
all
events
oh
how
exquisite
all
this
is
at
last
she
prevailed
upon
her
mother
to
get
upon
the
other
chair
now
the
whole
cathedral
was
glowing
with
a
reddish
yellow
light
this
billow
of
candles
which
crossed
it
illuminated
the
lower
arches
of
the
the
depth
of
the
chapels
and
glittered
upon
the
glass
of
some
shrine
or
upon
the
gold
of
some
tabernacle
the
rays
even
penetrated
into
the
apse
and
the
sepulchral
crypts
were
brightened
up
by
them
the
choir
was
a
mass
of
flame
with
its
altar
on
fire
its
glistening
stalls
and
its
old
railing
whose
ornamentation
stood
out
boldly
and
the
flight
of
the
nave
was
stronger
marked
than
ever
with
the
heavy
curved
pillars
below
supporting
the
round
arches
while
above
the
numbers
of
little
columns
grew
smaller
and
smaller
as
they
burst
forth
among
the
broken
arches
of
the
ogives
like
an
inexpressible
declaration
of
faith
and
love
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
lights
in
the
centre
under
the
roof
along
the
ribs
of
the
nave
there
was
a
yellow
cloud
a
thick
colour
of
wax
from
the
multitude
of
little
tapers
but
now
above
the
sound
of
feet
and
the
moving
of
chairs
one
heard
again
the
falling
of
the
chains
of
the
censers
then
the
organ
pealed
forth
majestically
a
glorious
burst
of
music
that
filled
to
overflowing
the
highest
arches
as
if
with
the
rumbling
of
thunder
it
was
at
this
instant
that
monseigneur
arrived
on
the
place
du
cloitre
the
statue
of
saint
agnes
had
reached
the
apse
still
borne
by
the
surpliced
clerks
and
her
face
looked
very
calm
under
the
light
as
if
she
were
more
than
happy
to
return
to
her
dreams
of
four
centuries
at
last
preceded
by
the
crosier
and
followed
by
the
mitre
monseigneur
entered
with
his
deacons
under
the
canopy
still
having
his
two
hands
covered
with
a
white
scarf
and
holding
the
blessed
sacrament
in
the
same
position
as
at
first
the
canopy
which
was
borne
down
the
central
aisle
was
stopped
at
the
railing
of
the
choir
and
there
on
account
of
a
certain
unavoidable
confusion
the
bishop
was
for
a
moment
made
to
approach
the
persons
who
formed
his
suite
since
felicien
had
reappeared
angelique
had
looked
at
him
constantly
it
so
happened
that
on
account
of
the
pressure
he
was
placed
a
little
at
the
right
of
the
canopy
and
at
that
moment
she
saw
very
near
together
the
white
head
of
monseigneur
and
the
blonde
head
of
the
young
man
that
glance
was
a
revelation
a
sudden
light
came
to
her
eyes
she
joined
her
hands
together
as
she
said
aloud
oh
monseigneur
the
son
of
monseigneur
her
secret
escaped
her
it
was
an
involuntary
cry
the
certainty
which
revealed
itself
in
this
sudden
fact
of
their
resemblance
perhaps
in
the
depths
of
her
mind
she
already
knew
it
but
she
would
never
have
dared
to
have
said
so
whilst
now
it
was
a
fact
of
which
there
could
be
no
denial
from
everything
around
her
from
her
own
soul
from
inanimate
objects
from
past
recollections
her
cry
seemed
repeated
hubertine
quite
overcome
said
in
a
whisper
this
young
man
is
the
son
of
monseigneur
around
these
two
the
crowd
had
gradually
accumulated
they
were
well
known
and
were
greatly
admired
the
mother
still
adorable
in
her
simple
toilette
of
linen
the
daughter
with
the
angelic
grace
of
a
cherubim
in
her
gown
of
white
foulard
as
light
as
a
feather
they
were
so
handsome
and
in
such
full
view
as
they
stood
upon
their
chairs
that
from
every
direction
eyes
were
turned
towards
them
and
admiring
glances
given
them
but
yes
indeed
my
good
lady
said
the
lemballeuse
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
group
but
yes
he
is
the
son
of
monseigneur
but
how
does
it
happen
that
you
have
not
already
heard
of
it
and
not
only
that
but
he
is
a
wonderfully
handsome
young
man
and
so
rich
rich
yes
indeed
he
could
buy
the
whole
town
if
he
wished
to
do
so
he
has
millions
and
millions
hubertine
turned
very
pale
as
she
listened
you
must
have
heard
his
history
spoken
of
continued
the
his
mother
died
soon
after
his
birth
and
it
was
on
that
account
that
monseigneur
concluded
to
become
a
clergyman
now
however
after
all
these
years
he
sent
for
his
son
to
join
him
he
is
in
fact
felicien
vii
d
hautecoeur
with
a
title
as
if
he
were
a
real
then
hubertine
was
intensely
grieved
but
angelique
beamed
with
joy
before
the
commencement
of
the
realisation
of
her
dream
she
was
not
in
the
slightest
degree
astonished
for
she
had
always
known
that
he
would
be
the
richest
the
noblest
and
the
handsomest
of
men
so
her
joy
was
intense
and
perfect
without
the
slightest
anxiety
for
the
future
or
suspicion
of
any
obstacle
that
could
possibly
come
between
them
in
short
he
would
in
his
turn
now
make
himself
known
and
would
tell
everything
as
she
had
fancied
gold
would
stream
down
with
the
little
flickering
flames
of
the
candles
the
organs
would
send
forth
their
most
glorious
music
on
the
occasion
of
their
betrothal
the
line
of
the
hautecoeurs
would
continue
royally
from
the
beginning
of
the
legend
norbert
i
jean
v
felicien
iii
jean
xii
then
the
last
felicien
vii
who
just
turned
towards
her
his
noble
face
he
was
the
descendant
of
the
cousins
of
the
virgin
the
master
the
superb
son
showing
himself
in
all
his
beauty
at
the
side
of
his
father
just
then
felicien
smiled
sweetly
at
her
and
she
did
not
see
the
angry
look
of
monseigneur
who
had
remarked
her
standing
on
the
chair
above
the
crowd
blushing
in
her
pride
and
love
oh
my
poor
dear
child
sighed
hubertine
but
the
chaplain
and
the
acolytes
were
ranged
on
the
right
and
the
left
and
the
first
deacon
having
taken
the
holy
sacrament
from
the
hands
of
monseigneur
he
placed
it
on
the
altar
it
was
the
final
benediction
the
sung
loudly
by
the
choristers
the
incenses
of
the
boxes
burning
in
the
censers
the
strange
brusque
silence
during
the
prayer
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lighted
church
overflowing
with
clergy
and
with
people
under
the
high
springing
arches
monseigneur
remounted
to
the
altar
took
again
in
his
two
hands
the
great
golden
sun
which
he
waved
back
and
forth
in
the
air
three
times
with
a
slow
sign
of
the
cross
chapter
xi
that
same
evening
on
returning
from
church
angelique
thought
to
herself
i
shall
see
him
again
very
soon
for
he
will
certainly
be
in
the
and
i
will
go
there
to
meet
without
having
exchanged
a
word
with
each
other
they
appeared
to
have
silently
arranged
this
interview
the
family
dined
as
usual
in
the
kitchen
but
it
was
eight
o
clock
before
they
were
seated
at
the
table
hubert
quite
excited
by
this
day
of
recreation
and
of
fete
was
the
only
one
who
had
anything
to
say
hubertine
unusually
quiet
scarcely
replied
to
her
husband
but
kept
her
looks
fixed
upon
the
young
girl
who
ate
heartily
and
with
a
good
appetite
although
she
scarcely
seemed
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
food
or
to
know
that
she
put
her
fork
to
her
mouth
so
absorbed
was
she
by
her
fancies
and
under
this
candid
forehead
as
under
the
crystal
of
the
purest
water
hubertine
read
her
thoughts
clearly
and
followed
them
as
they
formed
themselves
in
her
mind
one
by
one
at
nine
o
clock
they
were
greatly
surprised
by
a
ringing
of
the
it
proved
to
be
the
abbe
cornille
who
notwithstanding
his
great
fatigue
had
come
to
tell
them
that
monseigneur
the
bishop
had
greatly
admired
the
three
old
panels
of
marvellous
embroidery
yes
indeed
and
he
spoke
of
them
so
enthusiastically
to
me
that
i
was
sure
it
would
please
you
to
know
angelique
who
had
roused
up
on
hearing
the
name
of
monseigneur
fell
back
again
into
her
reveries
as
soon
as
the
conversation
turned
to
the
procession
then
after
a
few
minutes
she
got
up
but
where
are
you
going
dear
asked
hubertine
the
question
startled
her
as
if
she
herself
knew
not
why
she
had
left
her
seat
i
am
going
upstairs
mother
for
i
am
very
in
spite
of
this
plausible
excuse
hubertine
imagined
the
true
reason
that
influenced
her
it
was
the
need
of
being
by
herself
the
haste
of
communing
alone
with
her
great
happiness
when
she
held
her
in
her
arms
pressed
against
her
breast
she
felt
that
she
was
trembling
she
almost
seemed
to
avoid
her
usual
evening
kiss
looking
anxiously
in
her
face
hubertine
read
in
her
eyes
the
feverish
expectation
connected
with
the
meeting
it
was
all
so
evident
to
her
that
she
promised
herself
to
keep
a
close
watch
be
good
dear
and
sleep
but
already
after
a
hurried
to
hubert
and
to
the
abbe
cornille
angelique
was
halfway
up
the
stairs
quite
disturbed
as
she
realised
that
her
secret
had
almost
escaped
her
had
her
mother
held
her
against
her
heart
one
second
longer
she
would
have
told
her
everything
when
she
had
shut
herself
in
her
own
room
and
doubly
locked
her
door
the
light
troubled
her
and
she
blew
out
her
candle
the
moon
which
rose
later
and
later
had
not
yet
appeared
above
the
horizon
and
the
night
was
very
dark
without
undressing
she
seated
herself
before
the
open
window
looked
out
into
the
deep
shade
and
waited
patiently
for
the
hours
to
pass
the
minutes
went
by
rapidly
as
she
was
fully
occupied
with
the
one
idea
that
as
soon
as
the
clock
struck
for
midnight
she
would
go
down
to
find
felicien
as
it
would
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
do
she
traced
out
her
way
step
by
step
and
every
movement
she
would
make
with
the
most
perfect
composure
it
was
not
very
late
when
she
heard
the
abbe
cornille
take
his
leave
soon
after
the
huberts
in
their
turn
came
upstairs
then
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
someone
came
out
of
their
chamber
and
with
furtive
steps
moved
cautiously
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
stairway
then
stopped
as
if
listening
for
a
moment
before
returning
then
the
house
soon
sank
as
if
in
the
quiet
of
a
deep
sleep
when
the
great
church
clock
struck
twelve
angelique
left
her
seat
now
i
must
go
for
he
is
waiting
for
she
unlocked
the
door
and
passing
out
neglected
closing
it
after
her
going
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
she
stopped
as
she
approached
the
room
of
the
huberts
but
heard
nothing
nothing
but
the
indefinable
quivering
of
silence
moreover
she
was
neither
in
a
hurry
nor
had
she
any
fear
for
being
totally
unconscious
of
any
wrong
intentions
she
felt
at
perfect
ease
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
her
not
to
have
gone
down
an
inward
power
directed
and
led
her
and
it
all
seemed
so
simple
and
right
she
would
have
smiled
at
the
idea
of
a
hidden
danger
once
in
the
lower
rooms
she
passed
through
the
kitchen
to
go
out
into
the
garden
and
again
forgot
to
fasten
the
shutters
then
she
walked
rapidly
towards
the
little
gate
of
the
which
she
also
left
wide
open
after
her
notwithstanding
the
obscurity
and
the
dense
shadows
in
the
field
she
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
but
went
direct
to
the
little
plank
which
served
as
a
bridge
to
the
chevrotte
crossed
it
guiding
herself
by
feeling
the
way
as
if
in
a
familiar
place
where
every
tree
and
bush
were
well
known
to
her
turning
to
the
right
under
a
great
she
had
only
to
put
out
her
hands
to
have
them
earnestly
grasped
by
felicien
whom
she
knew
would
be
there
in
waiting
for
her
for
a
minute
without
speaking
angelique
pressed
felicien
s
hands
in
hers
they
could
not
see
each
other
for
the
sky
was
covered
with
a
misty
cloud
of
heat
and
the
pale
moon
which
had
just
risen
had
not
yet
lighted
it
up
at
length
she
spoke
in
the
darkness
her
heart
filled
to
overflowing
with
her
great
happiness
oh
my
dear
seigneur
how
i
love
you
and
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
she
laughed
aloud
at
the
realisation
of
the
fact
that
at
last
she
knew
him
she
thanked
him
for
being
younger
more
beautiful
and
richer
even
than
she
had
expected
him
to
be
her
gaiety
was
charming
it
was
a
cry
of
astonishment
and
of
gratitude
before
this
present
of
love
this
fulfillment
of
her
dreams
you
are
the
king
you
are
my
master
and
lo
here
am
i
your
slave
i
belong
to
you
henceforth
and
my
only
regret
is
that
i
am
of
so
little
worth
but
i
am
proud
of
being
yours
it
is
sufficient
for
you
to
love
me
and
that
i
may
be
in
my
turn
a
queen
it
was
indeed
well
that
i
knew
you
were
to
come
and
so
waited
for
you
my
heart
is
overflowing
with
joy
since
finding
that
you
are
so
great
so
far
above
me
ah
my
dear
seigneur
how
i
thank
you
and
how
i
love
gently
he
put
his
arm
around
her
as
he
said
come
and
see
where
i
he
made
her
cross
the
among
the
wild
grass
and
herbs
and
then
she
understood
for
the
first
time
in
what
way
he
had
come
every
night
into
the
field
from
the
park
of
the
bishop
s
palace
it
was
through
an
old
gate
that
had
been
unused
for
a
long
time
and
which
this
evening
he
had
left
half
open
taking
angelique
s
hand
he
led
her
in
that
way
into
the
great
garden
of
the
monseigneur
the
rising
moon
was
in
the
sky
under
a
veil
of
warm
mist
and
its
rays
fell
down
upon
them
with
a
white
mysterious
light
there
were
no
stars
visible
but
the
whole
vault
of
heaven
was
filled
with
a
dim
lustre
which
quietly
penetrated
everything
in
this
serene
night
slowly
they
walked
along
on
the
borders
of
the
chevrotte
which
crossed
the
park
but
it
was
no
longer
the
rapid
rivulet
rushing
over
a
pebbly
descent
it
was
a
quiet
languid
brook
gliding
along
through
clumps
of
trees
under
this
mass
of
luminous
vapour
between
the
bushes
which
seemed
to
bathe
and
float
therein
it
was
like
an
elysian
stream
which
unfolded
itself
before
them
angelique
soon
resumed
her
gay
chattering
i
am
so
proud
and
so
happy
to
be
here
on
your
felicien
touched
by
such
artless
frank
simplicity
listened
with
delight
as
she
talked
unrestrainedly
concealing
nothing
but
telling
all
her
inmost
thoughts
as
she
opened
her
heart
to
him
why
should
she
even
think
of
keeping
anything
back
she
had
never
harmed
anyone
so
she
had
only
good
things
to
say
ah
my
dear
child
it
is
i
who
ought
to
be
exceedingly
grateful
to
you
inasmuch
as
you
are
willing
to
love
me
a
little
in
so
sweet
a
way
tell
me
once
more
how
much
you
love
me
tell
me
exactly
what
you
thought
when
you
found
out
at
last
who
i
really
but
with
a
pretty
impatient
movement
she
interrupted
him
no
no
let
us
talk
of
you
only
of
you
am
i
really
of
any
consequence
at
all
events
what
matters
it
who
i
am
or
what
i
think
for
the
moment
you
are
the
only
one
of
and
keeping
as
near
him
as
possible
going
more
slowly
along
the
sides
of
the
enchanted
river
she
questioned
him
incessantly
wishing
to
learn
everything
about
him
of
his
childhood
his
youth
and
the
twenty
years
he
had
passed
away
from
his
father
i
already
know
that
your
mother
died
when
you
were
an
infant
and
that
you
grew
up
under
the
care
of
an
uncle
who
is
a
clergyman
i
also
know
that
monseigneur
refused
to
see
you
then
felicien
answered
speaking
in
a
very
low
tone
with
a
voice
that
seemed
as
if
it
came
from
the
past
yes
my
father
idolised
my
mother
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
i
were
guilty
since
my
birth
had
cost
her
her
life
my
uncle
brought
me
up
in
entire
ignorance
of
my
family
harshly
too
as
if
i
had
been
a
poor
child
confided
to
his
care
i
had
no
idea
of
my
true
position
until
very
recently
it
is
scarcely
two
years
in
fact
since
it
was
revealed
to
me
but
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
in
hearing
the
truth
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
always
that
a
great
fortune
belonged
to
me
all
regular
work
wearied
me
i
was
good
for
nothing
except
to
run
about
the
fields
and
amuse
myself
at
last
i
took
a
great
fancy
for
the
painted
windows
of
our
little
angelique
interrupted
him
by
laughing
gaily
and
he
joined
her
in
her
mirth
for
a
moment
i
became
a
workman
like
yourself
i
had
fully
decided
to
earn
my
living
by
painting
on
glass
and
was
studying
for
that
purpose
when
all
this
fortune
poured
down
upon
me
my
father
was
intensely
disappointed
when
my
uncle
wrote
him
that
i
was
a
fellow
and
that
i
would
never
consent
to
enter
into
the
service
of
the
church
it
had
been
his
expressed
wish
that
i
should
become
a
clergyman
perhaps
he
had
an
idea
that
in
so
doing
i
could
atone
for
the
death
of
my
mother
he
became
however
reconciled
at
last
and
wished
for
me
to
be
here
and
remain
near
him
ah
how
good
it
is
to
live
simply
to
live
he
exclaimed
yes
to
live
to
love
and
to
be
loved
in
this
trembling
cry
which
resounded
in
the
clear
night
air
vibrated
with
the
earnest
feeling
of
his
healthy
youth
it
was
full
of
passion
of
sympathy
for
his
dead
mother
and
of
the
intense
ardour
he
had
thrown
into
this
his
first
love
born
of
mystery
it
filled
all
his
spirit
his
beauty
his
loyalty
his
ignorance
and
his
earnest
desire
of
life
like
you
he
continued
i
was
indeed
expecting
the
unknown
and
the
evening
when
you
first
appeared
at
the
window
i
also
recognised
you
at
once
tell
me
all
that
you
have
ever
thought
and
what
you
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
in
the
days
that
have
but
again
she
refused
saying
gently
no
speak
only
of
yourself
i
am
eager
to
know
every
petty
incident
of
your
life
so
please
keep
nothing
back
in
that
way
i
shall
realise
that
you
belong
to
me
and
that
i
love
you
in
the
past
as
well
as
in
the
she
never
would
have
been
fatigued
in
listening
to
him
as
he
talked
of
his
life
but
was
in
a
state
of
joyous
ecstasy
in
thus
becoming
thoroughly
acquainted
with
him
adoring
him
like
a
little
child
at
the
feet
of
some
saint
neither
of
them
wearied
of
repeating
the
same
things
how
much
they
loved
each
other
and
how
dearly
they
were
beloved
in
return
the
same
words
returned
constantly
to
their
lips
but
they
always
seemed
new
as
they
assumed
unforeseen
immeasurable
depths
of
meaning
their
happiness
increased
as
they
thus
made
known
the
secrets
of
their
hearts
and
lingered
over
the
music
of
the
words
that
passed
their
lips
he
confessed
to
her
the
charm
her
voice
had
always
been
to
him
so
much
so
that
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
he
became
at
once
her
devoted
slave
she
acknowledged
the
delicious
fear
she
always
had
at
seeing
his
pale
face
flush
at
the
slightest
anger
or
displeasure
they
had
now
left
the
misty
banks
of
the
chevrotte
and
they
entered
under
the
shadows
of
the
great
oh
this
beautiful
garden
whispered
angelique
happy
to
breathe
in
the
freshness
which
fell
from
the
trees
for
years
i
have
wished
to
enter
it
and
now
i
am
here
with
you
yes
i
am
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
ask
him
where
he
was
leading
her
but
she
gave
herself
up
to
his
guidance
under
the
darkness
of
these
centenarian
trees
the
ground
was
soft
under
their
feet
the
archway
of
leaves
above
them
was
high
like
the
vaulted
ceiling
of
a
church
there
was
neither
sound
nor
breath
only
the
beating
of
their
own
hearts
at
length
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
little
pavilion
and
said
to
her
go
in
this
is
my
it
was
there
that
his
father
had
seen
fit
to
install
him
all
by
himself
in
this
distant
corner
of
the
park
on
the
first
floor
there
was
a
hall
and
one
very
large
room
which
was
now
lighted
by
a
great
lamp
above
was
a
complete
little
apartment
you
can
see
for
yourself
he
continued
smilingly
that
you
are
at
the
house
of
an
artisan
this
is
my
it
was
a
indeed
the
caprice
of
a
wealthy
young
man
who
amused
himself
in
his
leisure
hours
by
painting
on
glass
he
had
the
ancient
methods
of
the
thirteenth
century
so
that
he
could
fancy
himself
as
being
one
of
the
primitive
producing
masterpieces
with
the
poor
unfinished
means
of
the
older
time
an
ancient
table
answered
all
his
purposes
it
was
coated
with
moist
powdered
chalk
upon
which
he
drew
his
designs
in
red
and
where
he
cut
the
panes
with
heated
irons
disdaining
the
modern
use
of
a
diamond
point
the
muffle
a
little
furnace
made
after
the
fashion
of
an
old
model
was
just
now
quite
heated
the
baking
of
some
picture
was
going
on
which
was
to
be
used
in
repairing
another
stained
window
in
the
cathedral
and
in
cases
on
every
side
were
glasses
of
all
colours
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
made
expressly
for
him
in
blue
yellow
green
and
red
in
many
lighter
tints
marbled
smoked
shaded
and
black
but
the
walls
of
the
room
were
hung
with
admirable
stuffs
and
the
working
materials
disappeared
in
the
midst
of
a
marvellous
luxury
of
furniture
in
one
corner
on
an
old
tabernacle
which
served
as
a
pedestal
a
great
gilded
statue
of
the
blessed
virgin
seemed
to
smile
upon
them
so
you
can
work
you
really
can
work
repeated
angelique
with
childish
joy
she
was
very
much
amused
with
the
little
furnace
and
insisted
upon
it
that
he
should
explain
to
her
everything
connected
with
his
labour
why
he
contented
himself
with
the
examples
of
the
old
masters
who
used
glass
coloured
in
the
making
which
he
shaded
simply
with
black
the
reason
he
limited
himself
to
little
distinct
figures
to
the
gestures
and
draperies
of
which
he
gave
a
decided
character
his
ideas
upon
the
art
of
the
which
in
reality
declined
as
soon
as
they
began
to
design
better
to
paint
and
to
enamel
it
and
his
final
opinion
that
a
window
should
be
simply
a
transparent
mosaic
in
which
the
brightest
colours
should
be
arranged
in
the
most
harmonious
order
so
as
to
make
a
delicate
shaded
bouquet
but
at
this
moment
little
did
she
care
for
the
art
in
itself
these
things
had
but
one
interest
for
her
now
that
they
were
connected
with
him
that
they
seemed
to
bring
her
nearer
to
him
and
to
strengthen
the
tie
between
them
oh
she
exclaimed
how
happy
we
shall
be
together
you
will
paint
while
i
he
had
just
retaken
her
hands
in
the
centre
of
this
great
room
in
the
luxury
of
which
she
was
quite
at
her
ease
as
it
seemed
to
be
her
natural
surrounding
where
her
grace
would
be
fully
developed
both
of
them
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
was
as
usual
the
first
to
speak
now
everything
is
decided
upon
is
it
not
what
he
smilingly
asked
what
do
you
mean
our
he
hesitated
an
instant
his
face
which
had
been
very
pale
flushed
quickly
she
was
disturbed
at
such
a
change
have
i
made
you
angry
in
any
way
but
he
had
already
conquered
himself
and
pressed
her
hands
tenderly
with
a
grasp
that
seemed
to
cover
everything
yes
it
is
decided
upon
and
it
is
sufficient
for
you
to
wish
for
a
thing
that
it
should
be
done
no
matter
how
many
obstacles
may
oppose
it
henceforward
my
one
great
desire
in
life
will
be
to
obey
then
her
face
beamed
with
perfect
happiness
and
delight
she
did
not
have
a
single
doubt
all
seemed
to
her
quite
natural
to
be
so
that
it
could
be
finished
on
the
morrow
with
the
same
ease
as
in
many
of
the
miracles
of
the
golden
the
idea
never
occurred
to
her
that
there
should
be
the
slightest
hindrance
or
the
least
delay
since
they
really
loved
each
other
why
should
they
be
any
longer
separated
it
was
the
most
simple
thing
in
the
world
for
two
persons
who
loved
each
other
to
be
married
she
was
so
secure
in
her
happiness
that
she
was
perfectly
calm
since
it
is
agreed
upon
she
said
jokingly
give
me
your
he
took
her
little
hand
and
kissed
it
as
he
said
it
is
all
she
then
hastened
to
go
away
in
the
fear
of
being
surprised
by
the
dawn
and
also
impatient
to
relieve
her
mind
of
her
secret
he
wished
to
accompany
her
no
no
she
replied
we
should
not
get
back
before
daylight
i
can
easily
find
the
way
until
until
felicien
obeyed
and
watched
angelique
as
she
ran
first
under
the
shady
elms
then
along
the
banks
of
the
chevrotte
which
were
now
bathed
in
light
soon
she
closed
the
gate
of
the
park
then
darted
across
the
through
the
high
grass
while
on
her
way
she
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
wait
until
sunrise
but
that
she
would
rap
at
the
door
of
the
huberts
room
as
soon
as
she
reached
home
that
she
might
wake
them
up
and
tell
them
everything
she
was
in
such
an
expansion
of
happiness
such
a
turmoil
of
sincerity
that
she
realised
that
she
was
incapable
of
keeping
five
minutes
longer
this
great
secret
which
had
been
hers
for
so
long
a
time
she
entered
into
their
garden
and
closed
the
gate
and
there
near
the
cathedral
angelique
saw
hubertine
who
waited
for
her
in
the
night
seated
upon
the
stone
bench
which
was
surrounded
by
a
small
cluster
of
awakened
warned
by
some
inexpressible
feeling
she
had
gone
upstairs
then
down
again
and
on
finding
all
the
doors
open
that
of
the
chamber
as
well
as
that
of
the
house
she
had
understood
what
had
happened
so
uncertain
what
it
was
best
to
do
or
where
to
go
in
the
fear
lest
she
might
aggravate
matters
she
sat
down
anxiously
angelique
immediately
ran
to
her
without
embarrassment
kissed
her
repeatedly
her
heart
beating
with
joy
as
she
laughed
merrily
at
the
thought
that
she
had
no
longer
need
of
hiding
anything
from
her
oh
mother
mine
everything
is
arranged
we
are
to
be
married
very
soon
and
i
am
so
before
replying
hubertine
examined
her
closely
but
her
fears
vanished
instantly
before
the
limpid
eyes
and
the
pure
lips
of
this
exquisite
young
girl
yet
she
was
deeply
troubled
and
great
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
my
poor
dear
child
she
whispered
as
she
had
done
the
previous
evening
in
church
astonished
to
see
her
in
such
a
way
she
who
was
always
so
equable
who
never
wept
angelique
exclaimed
but
what
is
the
matter
mother
it
is
indeed
true
that
i
have
not
done
right
inasmuch
as
i
have
not
made
you
my
confidante
but
you
would
pardon
me
if
you
knew
how
much
i
have
suffered
from
it
and
how
keen
my
remorse
has
been
since
at
first
i
did
not
speak
later
on
i
did
not
dare
to
break
the
silence
will
you
forgive
me
she
had
seated
herself
near
her
mother
and
had
placed
her
arm
caressingly
around
her
waist
the
old
bench
seemed
almost
hidden
in
this
corner
of
the
cathedral
above
their
heads
the
lilacs
made
a
little
shade
while
near
them
was
the
bush
of
eglantine
which
the
young
girl
had
set
out
in
the
hope
that
it
might
bear
roses
but
having
been
neglected
for
some
time
it
simply
vegetated
and
had
returned
to
its
natural
state
mother
let
me
tell
you
everything
now
come
listen
to
me
chapter
xii
then
in
a
low
tone
angelique
began
her
story
she
related
in
a
flow
of
inexhaustible
words
all
that
had
happened
calling
up
the
most
minute
details
growing
more
and
more
excited
at
the
recollection
of
them
she
omitted
nothing
but
searched
her
memory
as
if
it
were
for
a
confession
she
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
although
her
cheeks
grew
very
red
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
flashes
of
pride
yet
she
did
not
raise
her
voice
but
continued
to
talk
earnestly
in
a
at
length
hubertine
interrupted
her
speaking
also
very
low
ah
my
dear
now
you
are
too
excited
you
have
indeed
to
correct
yourself
for
you
are
carried
away
by
your
feelings
as
if
by
a
great
wind
ah
my
vain
my
headstrong
child
you
are
always
the
same
little
girl
who
refused
to
wash
up
the
kitchen
floor
and
who
kissed
her
own
angelique
could
not
prevent
herself
from
laughing
no
do
not
laugh
it
may
be
that
you
will
not
have
tears
enough
to
weep
my
poor
darling
this
marriage
can
never
take
again
her
gaiety
burst
out
in
a
long
musical
laugh
but
mother
mother
what
are
you
saying
do
you
wish
to
punish
me
by
teasing
me
it
is
a
very
simple
matter
this
evening
felicien
is
to
talk
of
it
with
his
father
he
will
come
to
arrange
everything
with
could
it
be
true
that
she
believed
all
this
hubertine
was
distressed
and
knew
not
what
to
do
at
last
she
concluded
it
was
best
to
be
pitiless
and
tell
her
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
little
embroiderer
without
money
and
without
name
to
marry
felicien
d
hautecoeur
a
young
man
who
was
worth
so
many
millions
the
last
descendant
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
of
france
no
that
could
never
be
but
at
each
new
obstacle
angelique
tranquilly
replied
but
why
not
it
would
be
a
real
scandal
a
marriage
beyond
all
ordinary
conditions
of
happiness
did
she
hope
then
to
contend
against
all
the
world
but
why
not
monseigneur
is
called
very
strict
and
very
haughty
proud
of
his
name
and
severe
in
his
criticisms
in
regard
to
all
marks
of
affection
could
she
dare
to
expect
to
bend
him
but
why
not
and
unshakable
in
her
faith
in
her
firm
ingenuous
manner
she
said
it
is
very
odd
dear
mother
that
you
should
think
people
all
so
bad
especially
when
i
have
just
assured
you
that
everything
is
well
under
way
and
is
sure
to
come
out
all
right
do
you
not
recollect
that
only
two
months
ago
you
scolded
me
and
ridiculed
my
plans
yet
i
was
right
and
everything
that
i
expected
has
come
to
but
unhappy
child
wait
for
the
end
hubertine
now
thought
of
the
past
and
was
angry
with
herself
as
she
now
reflected
more
bitterly
than
ever
before
that
angelique
had
been
brought
up
in
such
ignorance
again
she
predicted
to
her
the
hard
lessons
of
the
reality
of
life
and
she
would
have
liked
to
have
explained
to
her
some
of
the
cruelties
and
abominations
of
the
world
but
greatly
embarrassed
she
could
not
find
the
necessary
words
what
a
grief
it
would
be
to
her
if
some
day
she
were
forced
to
accuse
herself
of
having
brought
about
the
unhappiness
of
this
child
who
had
been
kept
alone
as
a
recluse
and
allowed
to
dwell
in
the
continued
falsehood
of
imagination
and
dreams
listen
to
me
dearest
you
certainly
would
not
wish
to
marry
this
young
man
against
the
wish
of
us
all
and
without
the
consent
of
his
father
angelique
had
grown
very
serious
she
looked
her
mother
in
the
face
and
in
a
serious
tone
replied
why
should
i
not
do
so
i
love
him
and
he
loves
with
a
pang
of
anguish
hubertine
took
her
again
in
her
arms
clasped
her
tenderly
but
convulsively
and
looked
at
her
earnestly
but
without
speaking
the
pale
moon
had
disappeared
from
sight
behind
the
cathedral
and
the
flying
misty
clouds
were
now
delicately
coloured
in
the
heavens
by
the
approach
of
the
dawn
they
were
both
of
them
enveloped
in
this
purity
of
the
early
morn
in
the
great
fresh
silence
which
was
alone
disturbed
by
the
little
chirping
of
the
birds
but
alas
my
dear
child
happiness
is
only
found
in
obedience
and
in
humility
for
one
little
hour
of
passion
or
of
pride
we
sometimes
are
obliged
to
suffer
all
our
lives
if
you
wish
to
be
contented
on
this
earth
be
submissive
be
ready
to
renounce
and
give
up
but
feeling
that
she
was
still
rebellious
under
her
embrace
that
which
she
had
never
said
to
anyone
that
which
she
still
hesitated
to
speak
of
almost
involuntarily
escaped
from
her
lips
listen
to
me
once
more
my
dear
child
you
think
that
we
are
happy
do
you
not
your
father
and
i
we
should
indeed
be
so
had
not
our
lives
been
embittered
by
a
great
she
lowered
her
voice
still
more
as
she
related
with
a
trembling
breath
their
history
the
marriage
without
the
consent
of
her
mother
the
death
of
their
infant
and
their
vain
desire
to
have
another
child
which
was
evidently
the
punishment
of
their
fault
still
they
adored
each
other
they
had
lived
by
working
had
wanted
for
nothing
but
their
regret
for
the
child
they
had
lost
was
so
that
they
would
have
been
wretchedly
unhappy
would
have
quarrelled
and
perhaps
even
have
been
separated
had
it
not
been
that
her
husband
was
so
thoroughly
good
while
for
herself
she
had
always
tried
to
be
just
and
reasonable
reflect
my
daughter
do
not
put
any
in
your
path
which
will
make
you
suffer
later
on
be
humble
obey
check
the
impulse
of
your
heart
as
much
as
subdued
at
last
angelique
restrained
her
tears
but
grew
very
pale
as
she
listened
and
interrupted
her
by
saying
mother
you
pain
me
terribly
i
love
him
and
i
am
sure
that
he
loves
then
she
allowed
her
tears
to
flow
she
was
quite
overcome
by
all
she
had
listened
to
softened
and
with
an
expression
in
her
eyes
as
if
deeply
wounded
by
the
glimpse
given
her
of
the
probable
truth
of
the
case
yet
she
could
suffer
and
would
willingly
die
if
need
be
for
her
love
then
hubertine
decided
to
continue
i
do
not
wish
to
pain
you
too
deeply
at
once
yet
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
know
the
whole
truth
last
evening
after
you
had
gone
upstairs
i
had
quite
a
talk
with
the
abbe
cornille
and
he
explained
to
me
why
monseigneur
after
great
hesitation
had
at
last
decided
to
call
his
son
to
beaumont
one
of
his
greatest
troubles
was
the
impetuosity
of
the
young
man
the
uncontrollable
haste
which
he
manifested
to
plunge
into
the
excitement
of
life
without
listening
to
the
advice
of
his
elders
after
having
with
pain
renounced
all
hope
of
making
him
a
priest
his
father
found
that
he
could
not
establish
him
in
any
occupation
suitable
to
his
rank
and
his
fortune
he
would
never
be
anything
but
a
headstrong
fellow
restless
wandering
yielding
to
his
artistic
tastes
when
so
inclined
he
was
alarmed
at
seeing
in
his
son
traits
of
character
like
those
from
which
he
himself
had
so
cruelly
suffered
at
last
from
fear
that
he
might
take
some
foolish
step
and
fall
in
love
with
someone
beneath
him
in
position
he
wished
to
have
him
here
that
he
might
be
married
at
very
well
said
angelique
who
did
not
yet
understand
such
a
marriage
had
been
proposed
even
before
his
arrival
and
all
preliminaries
were
settled
yesterday
so
that
the
abbe
cornille
formally
announced
that
in
the
autumn
felicien
would
wed
mademoiselle
claire
de
voincourt
you
know
very
well
the
hotel
de
voincourt
there
close
to
the
bishop
s
palace
the
family
are
very
intimate
with
monseigneur
on
both
sides
nothing
better
could
be
hoped
for
either
in
the
way
of
name
or
of
fortune
the
abbe
himself
highly
approves
of
the
the
young
girl
no
longer
listened
to
these
reasons
of
the
fitness
of
things
suddenly
an
image
appeared
to
come
before
her
eyes
that
of
claire
she
saw
her
as
she
had
occasionally
had
a
glimpse
of
her
in
the
alleys
of
the
park
during
the
winter
or
as
she
had
seen
her
on
fete
days
in
the
cathedral
a
tall
young
lady
a
brunette
very
handsome
of
a
much
more
striking
beauty
than
her
own
and
with
a
royal
bearing
and
appearance
notwithstanding
her
haughty
air
she
was
said
to
be
very
good
and
kind
so
he
is
to
marry
this
elegant
young
lady
who
is
not
only
beautiful
but
very
rich
she
murmured
then
as
if
suddenly
pierced
by
a
sharp
agony
she
exclaimed
he
uttered
a
falsehood
he
did
not
tell
me
this
she
recollected
now
the
momentary
hesitation
of
felicien
the
rush
of
blood
which
had
coloured
his
cheeks
when
she
spoke
to
him
of
their
marriage
the
shock
was
so
great
that
she
turned
deadly
pale
and
her
head
fell
heavily
on
her
mother
s
shoulders
my
darling
my
dear
darling
this
is
indeed
a
cruel
thing
i
know
it
well
but
it
would
have
been
still
worse
had
you
waited
take
courage
then
and
draw
at
once
the
knife
from
the
wound
repeat
to
yourself
whenever
the
thought
of
this
young
man
comes
to
you
that
never
would
monseigneur
the
terrible
jean
xii
whose
intractable
pride
it
appears
is
still
recollected
by
all
the
world
give
his
son
the
last
of
his
race
to
a
little
embroiderer
found
under
a
gateway
and
adopted
by
poor
people
like
in
her
weakness
angelique
heard
all
this
without
making
any
objection
what
was
it
she
felt
pass
over
her
face
a
cold
breath
coming
from
a
distance
from
far
above
the
roofs
of
the
houses
seemed
to
freeze
her
blood
was
it
true
that
her
mother
was
telling
her
of
this
misery
of
the
world
this
sad
reality
in
the
same
way
that
parents
relate
the
story
of
the
wolf
to
unreasonable
children
she
would
never
forget
the
shock
and
the
grief
of
this
first
experience
of
a
bitter
disappointment
yet
however
she
already
excused
felicien
he
had
told
no
falsehood
he
simply
had
been
silent
were
his
father
to
wish
him
to
marry
this
young
girl
no
doubt
he
would
refuse
to
do
so
but
as
yet
he
had
not
dared
to
rebel
as
he
had
not
said
anything
to
her
of
the
matter
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
just
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
it
was
best
for
him
to
do
before
this
sudden
vanishing
away
of
her
pale
and
weak
from
the
rude
touch
of
the
actual
life
she
still
kept
her
faith
and
trusted
in
spite
of
all
in
the
future
realisation
of
her
dream
eventually
the
fair
promises
for
the
future
would
come
to
pass
even
although
now
her
pride
was
crushed
and
she
sank
down
into
a
state
of
humiliation
and
resignation
mother
it
is
true
i
have
done
wrong
but
i
will
never
sin
again
i
promise
you
that
i
will
be
patient
and
submit
myself
without
a
murmur
of
revolt
to
whatever
heaven
wishes
me
to
it
was
true
grace
which
spoke
within
her
the
trial
was
great
but
she
was
able
to
conquer
from
the
effects
of
the
education
she
had
received
and
the
excellent
example
of
the
home
life
in
which
she
had
grown
up
why
should
she
doubt
the
morrow
when
until
this
present
moment
everyone
near
her
had
been
so
generous
and
so
tender
towards
her
she
prayed
that
she
might
be
able
to
have
the
wisdom
of
catherine
the
meekness
of
elizabeth
the
chastity
of
agnes
and
by
the
aid
of
the
saints
she
was
sure
that
they
alone
would
help
her
to
triumph
over
every
trouble
was
it
not
true
that
her
old
friends
the
cathedral
the
and
the
chevrotte
the
little
fresh
house
of
the
huberts
the
huberts
themselves
all
who
loved
her
would
defend
her
without
her
being
obliged
to
do
anything
except
to
be
obedient
and
good
then
dear
child
you
promise
me
that
you
will
never
act
contrary
to
our
wishes
and
above
all
against
those
of
monseigneur
yes
mother
i
you
also
promise
me
not
to
see
this
young
man
again
and
no
longer
to
indulge
in
the
foolish
idea
of
marrying
him
at
this
question
her
courage
failed
her
she
almost
felt
the
spirit
of
rebellion
rise
again
within
her
as
she
thought
of
the
depth
of
her
love
but
in
a
moment
she
bowed
her
head
and
was
definitely
conquered
i
promise
to
do
nothing
to
bring
about
a
meeting
with
him
and
to
take
no
steps
towards
our
hubertine
touched
to
the
heart
pressed
the
young
girl
most
affectionately
in
her
arms
as
she
thanked
her
for
her
obedience
oh
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
was
when
wishing
to
do
good
to
the
child
she
so
tenderly
loved
she
was
forced
to
make
her
suffer
so
intensely
she
was
exhausted
and
rose
up
hastily
surprised
that
daylight
had
come
the
little
cry
of
the
birds
had
increased
in
every
direction
although
as
yet
none
were
to
be
seen
in
flight
in
the
sky
the
clouds
delicate
as
gauze
seemed
to
float
away
in
the
limpid
blueness
of
the
atmosphere
then
angelique
whose
look
had
mechanically
fallen
upon
her
wild
at
last
noticed
it
with
its
puny
leaves
she
smiled
sadly
as
she
said
you
were
right
mother
dear
it
will
never
be
in
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
angelique
was
at
her
work
as
usual
the
days
followed
each
other
and
every
forenoon
found
her
seated
before
the
chasuble
she
had
left
on
the
previous
evening
nothing
appeared
to
be
changed
outwardly
she
kept
strictly
her
promise
shut
herself
up
and
made
no
attempt
whatever
to
see
felicien
this
did
not
seem
to
depress
her
at
all
but
she
kept
her
bright
youthful
look
smiling
sweetly
at
hubertine
when
occasionally
she
saw
her
eyes
fixed
upon
her
as
if
astonished
however
in
this
enforced
silence
she
thought
only
of
him
he
was
always
in
her
mind
her
hope
remained
firm
and
she
was
sure
that
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
everything
would
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
in
fact
it
was
this
feeling
of
certainty
that
gave
her
such
an
air
of
courage
of
haughty
rectitude
and
of
justice
hubert
from
time
to
time
scolded
her
you
are
my
dear
you
are
really
growing
pale
i
hope
at
least
that
you
sleep
well
at
oh
yes
father
like
a
log
never
in
my
life
did
i
feel
better
than
but
hubertine
becoming
anxious
in
her
turn
proposed
that
they
should
take
a
little
vacation
and
said
if
you
would
like
it
my
child
we
will
shut
up
the
house
and
we
will
go
all
three
of
us
to
paris
for
a
oh
mother
mine
of
what
are
you
thinking
what
would
become
of
all
our
orders
for
work
you
know
i
am
never
in
better
health
than
when
closely
in
reality
angelique
simply
awaited
a
miracle
some
manifestation
of
the
invisible
which
would
give
her
to
felicien
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
she
had
promised
to
do
nothing
what
need
was
there
of
her
striving
since
in
the
beyond
some
unknown
power
was
always
working
for
her
so
in
her
voluntary
inaction
while
feigning
indifference
she
was
continually
on
the
watch
listening
to
the
voices
of
all
that
quivered
around
her
and
to
the
little
familiar
sounds
of
this
circle
in
which
she
lived
and
which
would
assuredly
help
her
something
must
eventually
come
from
necessity
as
she
leaned
over
her
not
far
from
the
open
window
she
lost
not
a
trembling
of
the
leaves
not
a
murmur
of
the
chevrotte
the
slightest
sighs
from
the
cathedral
came
to
her
magnified
tenfold
by
the
eagerness
of
her
attention
she
even
heard
the
slippers
of
the
beadle
as
he
walked
round
the
altar
when
putting
out
the
tapers
again
at
her
side
she
felt
the
light
touch
of
mysterious
wings
she
knew
that
she
was
aided
by
the
unknown
and
at
times
she
even
turned
suddenly
thinking
that
a
phantom
had
whispered
in
her
ear
the
way
of
gaining
the
victory
but
days
passed
and
no
change
came
at
night
that
she
need
not
break
her
word
angelique
at
first
did
not
go
out
upon
the
balcony
for
fear
of
being
tempted
to
rejoin
felicien
were
she
to
see
him
below
her
she
remained
quietly
waiting
in
her
chamber
then
as
the
leaves
even
scarcely
stirred
but
seemed
to
sleep
she
ventured
out
and
began
to
question
the
dark
shadows
as
before
from
whence
would
the
miracle
come
without
doubt
in
the
bishop
s
garden
would
be
seen
a
flaming
hand
which
would
beckon
to
her
to
approach
or
perhaps
the
sign
would
appear
in
the
cathedral
the
great
organs
of
which
would
peal
forth
and
would
call
her
to
the
altar
nothing
would
have
surprised
her
neither
the
doves
of
the
golden
legend
bringing
the
words
of
benediction
nor
the
intervention
of
saints
who
would
enter
through
the
walls
to
tell
her
that
monseigneur
wished
to
see
her
the
only
thing
at
which
she
wondered
was
the
slowness
of
the
working
of
the
marvel
like
the
day
the
nights
succeeded
nights
yet
nothing
nothing
manifested
itself
at
the
close
of
the
second
week
that
which
astonished
angelique
above
all
was
that
she
had
not
seen
felicien
she
it
was
true
had
pledged
herself
to
take
no
steps
towards
meeting
him
yet
without
having
said
so
to
anyone
she
thought
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
find
her
but
the
remained
deserted
and
he
no
longer
walked
among
the
wild
grasses
therein
not
once
during
the
past
fortnight
had
she
had
a
glimpse
of
him
by
day
or
even
seen
his
shadow
in
the
evening
still
her
faith
remained
unshaken
that
he
did
not
come
was
simply
that
he
was
occupied
in
making
his
preparations
to
rejoin
her
however
as
her
surprise
increased
there
was
at
length
mingled
with
it
a
beginning
of
anxiety
at
last
one
evening
the
dinner
was
sad
at
the
embroiderer
s
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
hubert
went
out
under
the
pretext
of
having
an
important
commission
to
attend
to
so
hubertine
remained
alone
with
angelique
in
the
kitchen
she
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
with
moistened
eyes
touched
by
such
courage
during
the
past
fortnight
not
one
word
had
been
exchanged
between
them
in
reference
to
those
things
with
which
their
hearts
were
full
and
she
was
deeply
moved
by
the
strength
of
character
and
loyalty
her
daughter
displayed
in
thus
keeping
her
promise
a
sudden
feeling
of
deep
tenderness
made
her
open
her
arms
and
the
young
girl
threw
herself
upon
her
breast
and
in
silence
they
clasped
each
other
in
a
loving
embrace
then
when
hubertine
was
able
to
speak
she
said
ah
my
poor
child
i
have
been
impatient
to
be
alone
with
you
for
you
must
know
that
now
all
is
at
an
end
yes
quite
at
an
startled
angelique
rose
quickly
exclaiming
what
is
felicien
dead
no
oh
no
if
he
will
never
come
again
it
is
only
that
he
is
so
hubertine
was
obliged
to
explain
to
her
that
the
day
after
the
procession
she
had
been
to
see
him
and
had
made
him
also
promise
that
he
would
keep
way
from
them
until
he
had
the
full
authorisation
of
monseigneur
to
do
otherwise
it
was
thus
a
definite
for
she
knew
a
marriage
would
be
utterly
impossible
she
had
made
him
almost
distracted
as
she
explained
to
him
how
wrongly
he
had
done
in
thus
compromising
a
young
ignorant
confiding
child
whom
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
make
his
wife
and
then
he
had
assured
her
that
if
he
could
not
see
her
again
he
would
die
from
grief
rather
than
be
disloyal
that
same
evening
he
confessed
everything
to
his
father
you
see
my
dear
continued
hubertine
you
are
so
courageous
that
i
can
repeat
to
you
all
i
know
without
hesitation
oh
if
you
realised
my
darling
how
i
pity
you
and
what
admiration
i
have
for
you
since
i
have
found
you
so
strong
so
brave
in
keeping
silent
and
in
appearing
gay
when
your
heart
was
heavily
burdened
but
you
will
have
need
of
even
more
firmness
yes
much
more
my
dear
this
afternoon
i
have
seen
the
abbe
cornille
and
he
gives
me
no
encouragement
whatever
monseigneur
refuses
to
listen
to
the
subject
so
there
is
no
more
she
expected
a
flood
of
fears
and
she
was
astonished
to
see
her
daughter
reseat
herself
tranquilly
although
she
had
turned
very
pale
the
old
oaken
table
had
been
cleared
and
a
lamp
lighted
up
this
ancient
servants
hall
the
quiet
of
which
was
only
disturbed
by
the
humming
of
the
boiler
mother
dear
the
end
has
not
yet
come
tell
me
everything
i
beg
of
you
have
i
not
a
right
to
know
all
since
i
am
the
one
above
all
others
most
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
and
she
listened
attentively
to
what
hubertine
thought
best
to
tell
her
of
what
she
had
learned
from
the
abbe
keeping
back
only
certain
details
of
the
life
which
was
as
yet
an
unknown
thing
to
this
innocent
child
chapter
xiii
since
the
return
of
his
son
to
him
monseigneur
s
days
had
been
full
of
trouble
after
having
banished
him
from
his
presence
almost
immediately
upon
the
death
of
his
wife
and
remaining
without
seeing
him
for
twenty
years
lo
he
had
now
come
back
to
him
in
the
plenitude
and
lustre
of
youth
the
living
portrait
of
the
one
he
had
so
mourned
with
the
same
delicate
grace
and
beauty
this
long
exile
this
resentment
against
a
child
whose
life
had
cost
that
of
the
mother
was
also
an
act
of
prudence
he
realised
it
doubly
now
and
regretted
that
he
had
changed
his
determination
of
not
seeing
him
again
age
twenty
years
of
prayer
his
life
as
clergyman
had
not
subdued
the
unregenerate
man
within
him
it
was
simply
necessary
that
this
son
of
his
this
child
of
the
wife
he
had
so
adored
should
appear
with
his
laughing
blue
eyes
to
make
the
blood
circulate
so
rapidly
in
his
veins
as
if
it
would
burst
them
as
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
dead
had
been
brought
to
life
again
he
struck
his
breast
he
sobbed
bitterly
in
penitence
as
he
remembered
that
the
joys
of
married
life
and
the
ties
springing
therefrom
were
prohibited
to
the
priesthood
the
good
abbe
cornille
had
spoken
of
all
this
to
hubertine
in
a
low
voice
and
with
trembling
lips
mysterious
sounds
had
been
heard
and
it
was
whispered
that
monseigneur
shut
himself
up
after
twilight
and
passed
nights
of
combat
of
tears
and
of
cries
the
violence
of
which
although
partly
stifled
by
the
hangings
of
his
room
yet
frightened
the
members
of
his
household
he
thought
that
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
conquered
passion
but
it
reappeared
with
the
violence
of
a
tempest
reminding
him
of
the
terrible
man
he
had
been
formerly
the
bold
adventurer
the
descendant
of
brave
legendary
chieftains
each
evening
on
his
knees
he
flayed
his
skin
with
haircloth
he
tried
to
banish
the
phantom
of
the
regretted
wife
by
calling
from
its
coffin
the
skeleton
which
must
now
be
there
but
she
constantly
appeared
before
him
living
in
the
delicious
freshness
of
youth
such
as
she
was
when
very
young
he
had
first
met
her
and
loved
her
with
the
devoted
affection
of
maturity
the
torture
then
recommenced
as
keen
and
intense
as
on
the
day
after
her
death
he
mourned
her
he
longed
for
her
with
the
same
revolt
against
god
who
had
taken
her
from
him
he
was
unable
to
calm
himself
until
the
break
of
day
when
quite
exhausted
by
contempt
of
himself
and
disgust
of
all
the
world
oh
divine
love
when
he
went
out
of
his
room
monseigneur
resumed
his
severe
attitude
his
expression
was
calm
and
haughty
and
his
face
was
only
slightly
pale
the
morning
when
felicien
had
made
his
confession
he
listened
to
him
without
interruption
controlling
himself
with
so
great
an
effort
that
not
a
fibre
of
his
body
quivered
and
he
looked
earnestly
at
him
distressed
beyond
measure
to
see
him
so
young
so
handsome
so
eager
and
so
like
himself
in
this
folly
of
impetuous
love
it
was
no
longer
with
bitterness
but
it
was
his
absolute
will
his
hard
duty
to
save
his
son
from
the
ills
which
had
caused
him
so
much
suffering
and
he
would
destroy
the
passion
in
his
child
as
he
wished
to
kill
it
in
himself
this
romantic
history
ended
by
giving
him
great
anxiety
could
it
be
true
that
a
poor
girl
a
child
without
a
name
a
little
embroiderer
first
seen
under
a
pale
ray
of
moonlight
had
been
transfigured
into
a
delicate
virgin
of
the
legends
and
adored
with
a
fervent
love
as
if
in
a
dream
at
each
new
acknowledgment
he
thought
his
anger
was
increased
as
his
heart
beat
with
such
an
inordinate
emotion
and
he
redoubled
his
attempts
at
knowing
not
what
cry
might
come
to
his
lips
he
had
finished
by
replying
with
a
single
word
never
then
felicien
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
him
implored
him
and
pleaded
his
cause
as
well
as
that
of
angelique
in
the
trembling
of
respect
and
of
terror
with
which
the
sight
of
his
father
always
filled
him
until
then
he
had
approached
him
only
with
fear
he
besought
him
not
to
oppose
his
happiness
without
even
daring
to
lift
his
eyes
towards
his
saintly
personage
with
a
submissive
voice
he
offered
to
go
away
no
matter
where
to
leave
all
his
great
fortune
to
the
church
and
to
take
his
wife
so
far
from
there
that
they
would
never
be
seen
again
he
only
wished
to
love
and
to
be
loved
unknown
monseigneur
shook
from
trembling
as
he
repeated
severely
the
word
never
he
had
pledged
himself
to
the
voincourts
and
he
would
never
break
his
engagement
with
them
then
felicien
quite
discouraged
realising
that
he
was
very
angry
went
away
fearing
lest
the
rush
of
blood
which
empurpled
his
cheeks
might
make
him
commit
the
sacrilege
of
an
open
revolt
against
paternal
authority
my
child
concluded
hubertine
you
can
easily
understand
that
you
must
no
longer
think
of
this
young
man
for
you
certainly
would
not
wish
to
act
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
monseigneur
i
knew
that
beforehand
but
i
preferred
that
the
facts
should
speak
for
themselves
and
that
no
obstacle
should
appear
to
come
from
angelique
had
listened
to
all
this
calmly
with
her
hands
listlessly
clasped
in
her
lap
scarcely
had
she
even
dropped
her
eyelids
from
time
to
time
as
with
fixed
looks
she
saw
the
scene
so
vividly
described
felicien
at
the
feet
of
monseigneur
speaking
of
her
in
an
overflow
of
tenderness
she
did
not
answer
immediately
but
continued
to
think
seriously
in
the
dead
quiet
of
the
kitchen
where
even
the
little
bubbling
sound
of
the
water
in
the
boiler
was
no
longer
heard
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
looked
as
her
hands
which
under
the
lamplight
seemed
as
if
made
of
beautiful
ivory
then
while
the
smile
of
perfect
confidence
came
back
to
her
lips
she
said
simply
if
monseigneur
refuses
it
is
because
he
waits
to
know
that
night
angelique
slept
but
little
the
idea
that
to
see
her
would
enable
at
once
monseigneur
to
decide
in
her
favor
haunted
her
there
was
in
it
no
personal
feminine
vanity
but
she
was
under
the
influence
of
a
deep
intense
love
and
her
true
affection
for
felicien
was
so
evident
she
was
sure
that
when
his
father
realised
it
he
could
not
be
so
obstinate
as
to
make
them
both
unhappy
many
times
she
turned
restlessly
in
her
bed
as
she
pictured
what
would
happen
before
her
closed
eyes
monseigneur
constantly
passed
in
his
robe
perhaps
it
was
indeed
through
him
and
by
him
that
the
expected
miracle
was
to
appear
the
warm
night
was
sleeping
without
and
she
eagerly
listened
for
the
voices
trying
to
know
what
the
trees
the
chevrotte
the
cathedral
her
chamber
itself
peopled
with
such
friendly
shadows
advised
her
to
do
but
there
was
only
an
indistinct
humming
and
nothing
precise
came
to
her
it
seemed
however
as
if
mysterious
whispers
encouraged
her
to
persevere
at
last
she
grew
impatient
of
these
too
slow
certitudes
and
as
she
fell
asleep
she
surprised
herself
by
saying
i
will
speak
to
when
she
awoke
her
proposed
plan
seemed
not
only
quite
natural
but
necessary
it
was
ingenuous
and
brave
born
of
a
proud
and
great
purity
she
knew
that
at
five
o
clock
on
every
saturday
afternoon
monseigneur
went
to
kneel
in
the
chapel
hautecoeur
where
he
liked
to
pray
alone
giving
himself
up
entirely
to
the
past
of
his
race
and
to
himself
seeking
a
solitude
which
was
respected
by
all
connected
with
the
cathedral
as
it
fortunately
happened
this
was
a
saturday
she
quickly
came
to
a
decision
at
the
bishop
s
palace
not
only
would
she
be
apt
to
find
it
difficult
to
be
received
but
on
the
other
hand
there
were
always
so
many
people
about
she
would
be
ill
at
ease
whilst
it
would
be
so
simple
to
await
him
in
the
chapel
and
to
introduce
herself
to
monseigneur
as
soon
as
he
appeared
that
day
she
embroidered
with
her
usual
application
and
composure
firm
in
her
wish
sure
of
doing
the
right
thing
she
had
no
impatient
fever
of
expectation
when
it
was
four
o
clock
she
spoke
of
going
to
see
the
gabet
and
went
out
dressed
as
for
an
ordinary
walk
wearing
her
little
tied
carelessly
under
her
chin
she
turned
to
the
left
and
pushing
open
the
linted
stuffed
door
of
the
portal
of
saint
agnes
let
it
fall
back
heavily
behind
her
the
church
was
empty
alone
the
confessional
of
saint
joseph
was
still
occupied
by
a
penitent
the
edge
of
whose
black
dress
was
just
seen
as
one
passed
angelique
who
had
been
perfectly
until
now
began
to
tremble
as
she
entered
this
sacred
cold
solitude
where
even
the
little
sound
of
her
steps
seemed
to
echo
terribly
why
was
it
that
her
heart
grew
so
oppressed
she
had
thought
she
was
quite
strong
and
the
day
had
passed
most
peacefully
she
was
so
sure
of
being
right
in
her
desire
to
be
happy
but
now
that
she
was
ignorant
of
what
might
happen
she
turned
pale
as
if
guilty
quite
frightened
at
thinking
that
she
was
to
see
monseigneur
and
that
in
truth
she
had
come
there
expressly
to
speak
to
him
she
went
quietly
to
the
chapel
hautecoeur
where
she
was
obliged
to
remain
leaning
against
the
gate
this
chapel
was
one
of
the
most
sunken
and
dark
of
the
old
romanesque
apse
like
a
cave
hewn
in
a
rock
straight
and
bare
with
the
simple
lines
of
its
low
vaulted
ceiling
it
had
but
one
window
that
of
stained
glass
on
which
was
the
legend
of
george
and
in
whose
panes
the
red
and
blue
so
predominated
that
they
made
a
light
as
if
it
were
twilight
the
altar
in
black
and
white
marble
was
unornamented
and
the
whole
place
with
its
picture
of
the
crucifixion
and
its
two
chandeliers
seemed
like
a
tomb
the
walls
were
covered
with
commemorative
tablets
a
collection
from
top
to
bottom
of
stones
crumbling
from
age
on
which
the
inscriptions
could
still
be
read
almost
stifled
angelique
waited
motionless
a
beadle
passed
who
did
not
even
see
her
so
closely
had
she
pressed
herself
against
the
interior
of
the
iron
railing
she
still
saw
the
dress
of
the
penitent
who
was
at
the
confessional
near
the
entrance
her
eyes
gradually
accustomed
to
the
were
mechanically
fixed
upon
the
inscriptions
the
characters
of
which
she
ended
by
deciphering
certain
names
struck
her
calling
back
to
her
memory
the
legends
of
the
chateau
d
hautecoeur
of
jean
v
le
grand
of
raoul
iii
and
of
herve
vii
she
soon
found
two
others
those
of
laurette
and
of
balbine
which
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
so
nervous
was
she
from
trouble
and
anxiety
laurette
who
fell
from
a
ray
of
moonlight
on
her
way
to
rejoin
her
betrothed
and
balbine
who
died
from
sudden
joy
at
the
return
of
her
husband
whom
she
thought
had
been
killed
in
the
war
they
both
of
them
came
back
at
night
and
enveloped
the
castle
with
their
immense
flowing
white
robes
had
she
not
seen
them
herself
the
day
of
their
visit
to
the
ruins
as
they
floated
towards
evening
above
the
towers
in
the
rosy
pallor
of
the
dusk
ah
how
willingly
she
would
die
as
they
did
although
but
sixteen
years
of
age
in
the
supreme
happiness
of
the
realisation
of
her
dream
a
loud
noise
which
reverberated
under
the
arches
made
her
tremble
it
was
the
priest
who
came
out
from
the
confessional
of
saint
joseph
and
shut
the
door
after
him
she
was
surprised
at
no
longer
seeing
the
penitent
who
had
already
gone
and
when
in
his
turn
the
clergyman
went
out
by
way
of
the
sacristy
she
realised
that
she
was
absolutely
alone
in
the
vast
solitude
of
the
cathedral
at
the
loud
sound
of
the
door
of
the
confessional
as
it
creaked
on
its
hinges
she
thought
that
monseigneur
was
coming
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
since
she
had
expected
him
yet
she
did
not
realise
it
for
her
excitement
prevented
her
from
taking
any
note
of
time
soon
a
new
name
drew
her
eyes
towards
the
tablets
felicien
iii
who
went
to
palestine
carrying
a
candle
in
his
hand
to
fulfil
a
vow
of
philippe
le
bel
and
her
heart
beat
with
pride
as
she
saw
before
her
mentally
the
youthful
felicien
vii
the
descendant
of
all
these
worthies
the
nobleman
whom
she
adored
and
by
whom
she
was
so
tenderly
loved
she
suddenly
became
filled
with
pride
and
fear
was
it
possible
that
she
herself
was
there
in
the
expectation
of
bringing
about
a
prodigy
opposite
her
there
was
a
fresher
plaque
of
marble
dating
from
the
last
century
the
black
letters
upon
which
she
could
easily
read
norbert
louis
ogier
marquis
d
hautecoeur
prince
of
mirande
and
of
rouvres
count
of
ferrieres
of
montegu
and
of
saint
marc
and
also
of
villemareuil
chevalier
of
the
four
royal
orders
of
saint
esprit
saint
michel
notre
dame
de
carmel
and
saint
louis
lieutenant
in
the
army
of
the
king
governor
of
normandy
holding
office
as
of
the
hunting
and
master
of
the
hounds
all
these
were
the
titles
of
felicien
s
grandfather
and
yet
she
had
come
so
simple
with
her
and
her
fingers
worn
by
the
needle
in
hopes
of
marrying
the
grandson
of
this
dead
dignitary
there
was
a
slight
sound
scarcely
a
rustling
on
the
flagstones
she
turned
and
saw
monseigneur
and
remained
motionless
at
this
silent
approach
without
the
pomp
and
surroundings
she
had
vaguely
expected
he
entered
into
the
chapel
tall
erect
and
dressed
in
purple
with
his
pale
face
his
rather
large
nose
and
his
superb
eyes
which
still
seemed
youthful
in
their
expression
at
first
he
did
not
notice
her
against
the
black
gate
then
as
he
was
about
to
kneel
down
he
saw
her
before
him
at
his
feet
with
trembling
limbs
overcome
by
respect
and
fear
angelique
had
fallen
upon
her
knees
he
seemed
to
her
at
this
moment
like
the
eternal
father
terrible
in
aspect
and
absolute
master
of
her
destiny
but
her
heart
was
still
courageous
and
she
spoke
at
once
oh
monseigneur
i
have
come
as
for
the
bishop
he
had
risen
immediately
he
had
a
vague
recollection
of
her
the
young
girl
seen
first
at
her
window
on
the
day
of
the
procession
and
a
little
later
standing
on
a
chair
in
the
church
this
little
embroiderer
with
whom
his
son
was
so
desperately
in
love
he
uttered
no
word
he
made
no
gesture
he
waited
stern
and
stiff
oh
monseigneur
i
have
come
on
purpose
that
you
may
see
me
you
have
it
is
true
refused
to
accept
me
but
you
do
not
know
me
and
now
here
i
am
please
look
at
me
before
you
repel
me
again
i
am
the
one
who
loves
and
am
also
beloved
and
that
is
all
nothing
beyond
this
affection
nothing
but
a
poor
child
found
at
the
door
of
this
church
you
see
me
at
your
feet
little
weak
and
humble
if
i
trouble
you
it
will
be
very
easy
for
you
to
send
me
away
you
have
only
to
lift
your
little
finger
to
crush
me
but
think
of
my
tears
were
you
to
know
how
i
have
suffered
you
would
be
compassionate
i
wished
monseigneur
to
plead
my
cause
in
my
turn
i
love
and
that
is
why
i
kneel
before
you
to
tell
you
so
i
am
ignorant
in
many
ways
i
only
know
i
love
all
my
strength
and
all
my
pride
is
centred
in
that
fact
is
not
that
sufficient
it
certainly
makes
one
great
and
good
to
be
able
to
say
that
one
really
she
continued
with
sighs
and
in
broken
phrases
to
confess
everything
to
him
in
an
unaffected
outpouring
of
ardent
feeling
it
was
a
true
affection
that
thus
acknowledged
itself
she
dared
to
do
so
because
she
was
innocent
and
pure
little
by
little
she
raised
her
head
we
love
each
other
monseigneur
without
doubt
he
has
already
told
you
how
all
this
came
to
pass
as
for
me
i
have
often
asked
myself
the
question
without
being
able
to
reply
to
it
but
we
love
each
other
and
if
it
is
a
crime
to
do
so
pardon
it
i
beseech
you
for
it
came
from
afar
from
everything
in
short
that
surrounded
us
when
i
realised
that
i
loved
him
it
was
already
too
late
to
prevent
it
now
is
it
possible
to
be
angry
on
that
account
you
can
keep
him
with
you
make
him
marry
some
other
person
but
you
can
not
prevent
him
from
giving
me
his
heart
he
will
die
without
me
as
i
shall
if
obliged
to
part
from
him
when
he
is
not
by
my
side
i
feel
that
he
is
really
near
me
and
that
we
will
never
be
entirely
separated
since
we
carry
each
other
s
life
with
us
i
have
only
to
close
my
eyes
to
him
when
i
wish
so
firmly
is
his
image
impressed
upon
my
soul
our
whole
natures
are
thus
closely
united
for
life
and
could
you
wish
to
draw
us
away
from
this
union
oh
monseigneur
it
is
divine
do
not
try
to
prevent
us
loving
each
other
he
looked
at
her
in
her
simple
so
fresh
so
unpretending
and
attractive
he
listened
to
her
as
she
repeated
the
canticle
of
their
love
in
a
voice
that
both
fascinated
and
troubled
him
and
which
grew
stronger
by
degrees
but
as
her
fell
upon
her
shoulders
her
exquisite
hair
seemed
to
make
a
halo
around
her
head
of
fine
gold
and
she
appeared
to
him
indeed
like
one
of
those
legendary
virgins
of
the
old
so
frail
was
she
so
primitive
so
absorbed
in
her
deep
feeling
of
intense
and
pure
affection
be
good
be
merciful
monseigneur
you
are
the
master
do
allow
us
to
be
happy
she
implored
him
and
finding
that
he
remained
unmoved
without
speaking
she
again
bowed
down
her
head
oh
this
unhappy
child
at
his
feet
this
odour
of
youth
that
came
up
from
the
sweet
figure
thus
bent
before
him
there
he
saw
as
it
were
again
the
beautiful
light
locks
he
had
so
fondly
caressed
in
the
days
gone
by
she
whose
memory
still
distressed
him
after
twenty
years
of
penitence
had
the
same
fresh
youthfulness
the
same
proud
expression
and
the
same
grace
she
had
it
was
she
herself
who
now
sobbed
and
besought
him
to
be
tender
and
merciful
tears
had
come
to
angelique
yet
she
continued
to
outpour
her
heart
and
monseigneur
it
is
not
only
that
i
love
him
but
i
also
love
the
nobility
of
his
name
the
lustre
of
his
royal
fortune
yes
i
know
well
that
being
nothing
that
having
nothing
it
seems
as
if
i
were
only
desirous
of
his
money
in
a
way
it
is
true
it
is
also
for
his
wealth
that
i
wish
to
marry
him
i
tell
you
this
because
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
know
me
thoroughly
ah
to
become
rich
by
him
and
with
him
to
owe
all
my
happiness
to
him
to
live
in
the
sweetness
and
splendour
of
luxury
to
be
free
in
our
loving
home
and
to
have
no
more
sorrow
no
misery
around
us
that
is
my
ideal
since
he
has
loved
me
i
fancy
myself
dressed
in
heavy
brocades
as
ladies
wore
in
olden
days
i
have
on
my
arms
and
around
my
neck
strings
of
pearls
and
precious
stones
i
have
horses
and
carriages
groves
in
which
i
take
long
walks
followed
by
pages
whenever
i
think
of
him
my
dream
recommences
and
i
say
to
myself
this
must
all
come
to
pass
for
it
perfects
my
desire
to
become
a
is
it
then
monseigneur
a
bad
thing
to
love
him
more
because
he
can
gratify
all
my
childish
wishing
by
showering
down
miraculous
floods
of
gold
upon
me
as
in
he
saw
then
that
she
rose
up
proudly
with
a
charming
stately
air
of
a
true
princess
in
spite
of
her
real
simplicity
and
she
was
always
exactly
like
the
fair
maiden
of
other
years
with
the
same
delicacy
the
same
tender
tears
clear
as
smiles
a
species
of
intoxication
came
from
her
the
warm
breath
of
which
mounted
to
his
face
the
same
shadow
of
a
remembrance
which
made
him
at
night
throw
himself
on
his
devotional
chair
sobbing
so
deeply
that
he
disturbed
the
sacred
silence
of
the
palace
until
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
of
this
same
day
he
had
contended
with
himself
again
and
this
long
history
of
love
this
story
of
passion
would
only
revive
and
excite
his
incurable
wound
but
behind
his
impassiveness
nothing
was
seen
nothing
betrayed
his
effort
at
and
his
attempt
to
conquer
the
beating
of
his
heart
were
he
to
lose
his
life
s
blood
drop
by
drop
no
one
should
see
it
flow
and
he
now
simply
became
paler
was
silent
and
immovable
at
last
this
great
persistent
silence
made
angelique
desperate
and
she
redoubled
her
prayers
i
put
myself
in
your
hands
monseigneur
do
with
me
whatever
you
think
best
but
have
pity
when
deciding
my
still
as
he
continued
silent
he
terrified
her
and
seemed
to
grow
taller
than
ever
as
he
stood
before
her
in
his
fearful
majesty
the
deserted
cathedral
whose
aisles
were
already
dark
with
its
high
vaulted
arches
where
the
daylight
seemed
dying
made
the
agony
of
this
silence
still
harder
to
bear
in
the
chapel
where
the
commemorative
slabs
could
no
longer
be
seen
there
remained
only
the
bishop
in
his
purple
cassock
that
now
looked
black
and
his
long
white
face
which
alone
seemed
to
have
absorbed
all
the
light
she
saw
his
bright
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
an
depth
of
expression
and
shrunk
from
them
wondering
if
it
were
possible
that
anger
made
them
shine
in
so
strange
a
way
monseigneur
had
i
not
come
i
should
have
eternally
reproached
myself
for
having
brought
about
the
unhappiness
of
us
both
from
my
want
of
courage
tell
me
then
oh
tell
me
that
i
was
right
in
doing
so
and
that
you
will
give
us
your
consent
what
use
would
there
be
in
discussing
the
matter
with
this
child
he
had
already
given
his
son
the
reasons
for
his
refusal
and
that
was
that
he
had
not
yet
spoken
was
only
because
he
thought
he
had
nothing
to
say
she
no
doubt
understood
him
and
she
seemed
to
wish
to
raise
herself
up
that
she
might
be
able
to
kiss
his
hands
but
he
threw
them
behind
him
violently
and
she
was
startled
at
seeing
his
white
face
become
suddenly
crimson
from
a
rush
of
blood
to
his
head
monseigneur
monseigneur
at
last
he
opened
his
lips
to
say
to
her
just
one
word
the
same
he
had
said
to
his
son
never
and
without
remaining
to
pray
that
day
as
was
his
wont
he
left
the
chapel
and
with
slow
steps
soon
disappeared
behind
the
pillars
of
the
apse
falling
on
the
flagstones
angelique
wept
for
a
long
time
sobbing
deeply
in
the
great
peaceful
silence
of
the
empty
church
chapter
xiv
that
same
evening
in
the
kitchen
after
they
left
the
angelique
confessed
everything
to
hubert
telling
him
of
her
interview
with
the
bishop
and
of
the
latter
s
refusal
she
was
very
pale
but
not
at
all
excited
hubert
was
quite
overcome
what
could
it
be
possible
that
his
dear
child
already
suffered
that
she
also
had
been
so
deeply
wounded
in
her
affections
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
from
his
sympathy
with
her
as
they
were
both
of
that
excessively
sensitive
nature
that
at
the
least
breath
they
were
carried
away
by
their
imaginations
ah
my
poor
darling
why
did
you
not
consult
me
i
would
willingly
have
accompanied
you
and
perhaps
i
might
have
persuaded
monseigneur
to
yield
to
your
with
a
look
hubertine
stopped
him
he
was
really
unreasonable
was
it
not
much
better
to
seize
this
occasion
to
put
an
end
at
once
to
all
ideas
of
a
marriage
which
would
be
impossible
she
took
the
young
girl
in
her
arms
and
tenderly
kissed
her
forehead
then
now
it
is
ended
my
dear
child
all
ended
angelique
at
first
did
not
appear
to
understand
what
was
said
to
her
soon
the
words
returned
to
her
as
if
from
a
distance
she
looked
fixedly
before
her
seeming
anxious
to
question
the
empty
space
and
at
last
she
replied
without
doubt
indeed
on
the
morrow
she
seated
herself
at
the
and
embroidered
as
she
was
wont
to
do
she
took
up
her
usual
routine
of
daily
work
and
did
not
appear
to
suffer
moreover
no
allusion
was
made
to
the
past
she
no
longer
looked
from
time
to
time
out
of
the
window
into
the
garden
and
gradually
losing
her
paleness
the
natural
colour
came
back
to
her
cheeks
the
sacrifice
appeared
to
have
been
accomplished
hubert
himself
thought
it
was
so
and
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
hubertine
did
all
in
his
power
to
keep
felicien
at
a
distance
the
latter
not
daring
to
openly
revolt
against
his
father
grew
feverishly
impatient
to
such
a
degree
that
he
almost
broke
the
promise
he
had
made
to
wait
quietly
without
trying
to
see
angelique
again
he
wrote
to
her
and
the
letters
were
intercepted
he
even
went
to
the
house
one
morning
but
it
was
hubert
alone
who
received
him
their
explanatory
conversation
saddened
them
both
to
an
equal
degree
so
much
did
the
young
man
appear
to
suffer
when
the
embroiderer
told
him
of
his
daughter
s
calmness
and
her
air
of
forgetfulness
he
besought
him
to
be
loyal
and
go
to
away
that
he
might
not
again
throw
the
child
into
the
fearful
trouble
of
the
last
few
weeks
felicien
again
pledged
himself
to
be
patient
but
he
violently
refused
to
take
back
his
word
for
he
was
still
hopeful
that
he
might
persuade
his
father
in
the
end
he
could
wait
he
would
let
affairs
remain
in
their
present
state
with
the
voincourts
where
he
dined
twice
a
week
doing
so
simply
to
avoid
a
direct
act
of
open
rebellion
and
as
he
left
the
house
he
besought
hubert
to
explain
to
angelique
why
he
had
consented
to
the
torment
of
not
seeing
her
for
the
moment
he
thought
only
of
her
and
the
sole
aim
of
everything
he
did
was
to
gain
her
at
last
when
her
husband
repeated
this
conversation
to
her
hubertine
grew
very
serious
then
after
a
short
silence
she
asked
shall
you
tell
our
daughter
what
he
asked
you
to
say
to
her
i
ought
to
do
she
was
again
silent
but
finally
added
act
according
to
your
conscience
but
he
is
now
under
a
delusion
he
will
eventually
be
obliged
to
yield
to
his
father
s
wishes
and
then
our
poor
dear
little
girl
will
die
in
hubert
overcome
with
grief
hesitated
but
after
contending
with
himself
he
concluded
to
repeat
nothing
moreover
he
became
a
little
reassured
each
day
when
his
wife
called
his
attention
to
angelique
s
tranquil
appearance
you
see
well
that
the
wound
is
healing
she
is
learning
to
but
she
did
not
forget
she
also
was
simply
waiting
all
hope
of
human
aid
having
died
within
her
she
now
had
returned
to
the
idea
of
some
wonderful
prodigy
there
would
surely
be
one
if
god
wished
her
to
be
happy
she
had
only
to
give
herself
up
entirely
into
his
hands
she
believed
that
this
new
trial
had
been
sent
to
her
as
a
punishment
for
having
attempted
to
force
his
will
in
intruding
upon
monseigneur
without
true
grace
mankind
was
weak
and
incapable
of
success
her
need
of
that
grace
made
her
humble
bringing
to
her
as
an
only
hope
the
aid
of
the
invisible
so
that
she
gave
up
acting
for
herself
but
left
everything
to
the
mysterious
forces
which
surrounded
her
each
evening
at
lamplight
she
recommenced
her
reading
of
the
golden
legend
being
as
delighted
with
it
as
when
she
was
a
young
child
she
doubted
none
of
the
miracles
related
therein
being
convinced
that
the
power
of
the
unknown
is
without
limit
for
the
triumph
of
pure
souls
just
at
this
time
the
upholsterer
of
the
cathedral
ordered
of
the
huberts
a
panel
of
the
very
richest
embroidery
for
the
throne
of
monseigneur
the
bishop
this
panel
one
yard
and
a
half
in
width
and
three
yards
in
length
was
to
be
set
in
old
carved
wood
and
on
it
were
to
be
represented
two
angels
of
holding
a
crown
on
which
were
to
be
the
arms
of
the
hautecoeurs
it
was
necessary
that
the
embroidery
should
be
in
a
work
which
not
only
required
great
artistic
knowledge
but
also
needed
physical
strength
to
be
well
done
when
proposed
to
the
huberts
they
at
first
declined
the
offer
being
not
only
fearful
of
fatiguing
angelique
but
especially
dreading
that
she
would
be
saddened
by
the
remembrances
which
would
be
brought
to
her
mind
as
she
wrought
thread
after
thread
during
the
several
weeks
but
she
insisted
upon
accepting
the
command
and
every
morning
applied
herself
to
her
task
with
an
extraordinary
energy
it
seemed
as
if
she
found
her
happiness
in
tiring
herself
and
that
she
needed
to
be
physically
exhausted
in
order
to
be
calm
so
in
the
old
workroom
life
continued
in
the
same
regular
way
as
if
their
hearts
had
not
even
for
a
moment
beaten
more
quickly
than
usual
whilst
hubert
occupied
himself
with
arranging
the
frames
or
drew
the
patterns
or
stretched
or
relaxed
the
materials
hubertine
helped
angelique
both
of
them
having
their
hands
terribly
tired
and
bruised
when
evening
came
for
the
angels
and
the
ornaments
it
had
been
necessary
at
the
beginning
to
divide
each
subject
into
several
parts
which
were
treated
separately
in
order
to
perfect
the
most
salient
points
angelique
first
took
spools
of
coarse
unbleached
thread
which
she
with
the
strong
thread
of
brittany
in
a
contrary
direction
and
as
the
need
came
making
use
of
a
heavy
pair
of
shears
as
well
as
of
a
she
modelled
these
threads
shaped
the
drapery
of
the
angels
and
detached
the
details
of
the
ornaments
in
all
this
there
was
a
real
work
of
sculpture
at
last
when
the
desired
form
was
obtained
with
the
aid
of
hubertine
she
threw
on
masses
of
gold
thread
which
she
fastened
down
with
little
stitches
of
silk
thus
there
was
a
of
gold
incomparably
soft
and
bright
shining
like
a
sun
in
the
centre
of
this
dark
smoky
room
the
old
tools
were
arranged
in
the
same
lines
as
they
had
been
for
centuries
the
punches
the
awls
the
mallets
and
the
hammers
on
the
the
little
donkey
and
the
tinsel
the
thimbles
and
the
needles
moved
up
and
down
as
usual
while
in
the
different
corners
where
they
ended
by
growing
rusty
the
diligent
the
hand
and
the
reel
for
winding
seemed
to
sleep
in
the
peaceful
quiet
which
entered
through
the
open
window
days
passed
angelique
broke
many
needles
between
morning
and
evening
so
difficult
was
it
to
sew
down
the
gold
through
the
thickness
of
the
waxed
threads
to
have
seen
her
one
would
have
said
she
was
so
thoroughly
absorbed
by
her
hard
work
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
at
nine
o
clock
she
was
exhausted
by
fatigue
and
going
to
bed
she
sank
at
once
into
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
when
her
embroidery
gave
her
mind
a
moment
s
leisure
she
was
astonished
not
to
see
felicien
although
she
took
no
step
towards
seeking
him
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
ought
to
have
tried
every
possible
way
to
come
to
her
yet
she
approved
of
his
wisdom
in
acting
as
he
did
and
would
have
scolded
him
had
he
tried
to
hasten
matters
no
doubt
he
also
looked
for
something
supernatural
to
happen
it
was
this
expectation
upon
which
she
now
lived
thinking
each
night
that
it
would
certainly
come
on
the
morrow
until
now
she
had
never
rebelled
still
at
times
she
lifted
up
her
head
inquiringly
as
if
asking
what
has
nothing
yet
come
to
pass
and
then
she
pricked
her
finger
so
deeply
that
her
hand
bled
and
she
was
obliged
to
take
the
pincers
to
draw
the
needle
out
when
her
needle
would
break
with
a
sharp
little
sound
as
if
of
glass
she
did
not
even
make
a
movement
of
impatience
hubertine
was
very
anxious
on
seeing
her
apply
herself
so
desperately
to
her
work
and
as
the
time
for
the
great
washing
had
come
again
she
forced
her
to
leave
her
panel
of
embroidery
that
she
might
have
four
good
days
of
active
outdoor
life
in
the
broad
sunlight
the
gabet
now
free
of
her
rheumatism
was
able
to
help
in
the
soaping
and
rinsing
it
was
a
regular
fete
in
the
these
last
august
days
in
which
the
weather
was
splendid
the
sky
almost
cloudless
while
a
delicious
fragrance
came
up
from
the
chevrotte
the
water
of
which
as
it
passed
under
the
willows
was
almost
icy
cold
the
first
day
angelique
was
very
gay
as
she
beat
the
linen
after
plunging
it
in
the
stream
enjoying
to
the
full
the
river
the
elms
the
old
ruined
mill
the
wild
herbs
and
all
those
friendly
surroundings
so
filled
with
pleasant
memories
was
it
not
there
she
had
become
acquainted
with
felicien
who
under
the
moonlight
had
at
first
seemed
so
mysterious
a
being
and
who
later
on
had
been
so
adorably
awkward
the
morning
when
he
ran
after
the
that
was
being
carried
away
by
the
current
as
she
rinsed
each
article
she
could
not
refrain
from
glancing
at
the
gateway
of
the
bishop
s
garden
which
until
recently
had
been
nailed
up
one
evening
she
had
passed
through
it
on
his
arm
and
who
could
tell
but
he
might
suddenly
now
open
it
and
come
to
take
her
as
she
applied
herself
to
her
work
in
the
midst
of
the
frothy
foam
that
at
times
almost
covered
her
but
the
next
day
as
the
gabet
brought
the
last
barrow
of
linen
which
she
spread
out
on
the
grass
with
angelique
she
interrupted
her
interminable
chattering
upon
the
gossip
of
the
neighbourhood
to
say
maliciously
by
the
way
you
know
that
monseigneur
is
to
marry
his
son
the
young
girl
who
was
just
smoothing
out
a
sheet
knelt
down
in
the
grass
her
strength
leaving
her
all
at
once
from
the
rudeness
of
the
shock
yes
everyone
is
talking
of
it
the
son
of
monseigneur
will
in
the
autumn
marry
mademoiselle
de
voincourt
it
seems
that
everything
was
decided
upon
and
arranged
she
remained
on
her
knees
as
a
flood
of
confused
ideas
passed
through
her
brain
and
a
strange
humming
was
in
her
ears
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
the
news
and
she
realised
it
must
be
true
her
mother
had
already
warned
her
so
she
ought
to
have
been
prepared
for
it
she
did
not
yet
even
doubt
felicien
s
love
for
her
as
that
was
her
faith
and
her
strength
but
at
the
present
moment
that
which
weakened
her
so
greatly
and
excited
her
to
the
very
depths
of
her
being
was
the
thought
that
trembling
before
the
commands
of
his
father
he
could
at
last
yield
from
weariness
and
consent
to
wed
one
whom
he
did
not
love
then
he
would
be
lost
to
her
whom
he
really
adored
never
had
she
thought
such
an
act
on
his
part
possible
but
now
she
saw
him
obliged
by
his
filial
duty
and
his
sense
of
obedience
to
make
them
both
unhappy
for
ever
still
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
little
gate
she
at
last
revolted
against
the
facts
feeling
as
if
she
must
go
and
shake
the
bars
force
them
open
with
her
hands
run
to
felicien
and
aiding
him
by
her
own
courage
persuade
him
not
to
yield
she
was
surprised
to
hear
herself
reply
to
the
gabet
in
the
purely
mechanical
instinct
of
hiding
her
trouble
ah
then
he
is
to
marry
mademoiselle
claire
she
is
not
only
very
beautiful
but
it
is
said
she
is
also
very
certainly
as
soon
as
the
old
woman
went
away
she
must
go
and
find
him
she
had
waited
long
enough
she
would
break
her
promise
of
not
seeing
him
as
if
it
were
a
troublesome
obstacle
what
right
had
anyone
to
separate
them
in
this
way
everything
spoke
to
her
of
their
affection
the
cathedral
the
fresh
water
and
the
old
under
which
they
had
been
so
happy
since
their
affection
had
grown
on
this
spot
it
was
there
that
she
wished
to
find
him
again
to
go
with
him
far
away
so
far
that
no
one
would
ever
see
them
that
is
all
said
at
last
the
gabet
as
she
hung
the
last
napkins
on
a
bush
in
two
hours
they
will
be
dry
mademoiselle
as
you
no
longer
have
need
of
now
standing
in
the
midst
of
this
efflorescence
of
linen
that
shone
on
the
green
grass
angelique
thought
of
that
other
day
when
in
the
tempest
of
wind
among
the
flapping
of
the
sheets
and
tablecloths
they
unfolded
so
ingenuously
the
secrets
of
their
lives
to
each
other
why
had
he
discontinued
his
visits
to
her
why
had
he
not
come
to
meet
her
during
her
healthy
exercise
of
the
past
three
days
but
it
would
not
be
long
before
she
would
run
to
him
and
when
he
had
clasped
her
in
his
arms
he
would
know
well
that
he
was
hers
and
hers
only
she
would
not
even
need
to
reproach
him
for
his
apparent
weakness
it
would
be
enough
for
her
to
show
herself
to
make
him
realise
that
their
happiness
was
in
being
together
he
would
dare
everything
for
her
sake
when
once
she
had
rejoined
him
an
hour
passed
and
angelique
walked
slowly
between
the
pieces
of
linen
all
white
herself
from
the
blinding
reflection
of
the
sun
and
a
confused
sentiment
awoke
in
her
breast
which
growing
stronger
and
stronger
prevented
her
from
going
over
to
the
gate
as
she
had
wished
to
do
she
was
frightened
before
this
commencement
of
a
struggle
what
did
it
mean
she
certainly
could
act
according
to
her
own
will
yet
something
new
inexplicable
thwarted
her
and
changed
the
simplicity
of
her
passion
it
was
such
a
simple
thing
to
go
to
a
beloved
one
yet
she
could
not
possibly
do
so
now
being
kept
back
by
a
tormenting
doubt
also
since
she
had
given
her
promise
perhaps
it
would
be
wrong
to
break
it
in
the
evening
when
the
whole
wash
was
dry
and
hubertine
came
to
help
her
to
take
it
to
the
house
she
was
still
undecided
what
to
do
and
concluded
to
reflect
upon
it
during
the
night
with
her
arms
filled
to
overflowing
with
linen
white
as
snow
and
smelling
fresh
and
clean
she
cast
an
anxious
look
towards
the
already
bathed
in
the
twilight
as
if
it
were
a
friendly
corner
of
nature
refusing
to
be
her
accomplice
in
the
morning
angelique
was
greatly
troubled
when
she
awoke
several
other
nights
passed
without
her
having
come
to
any
decision
she
could
not
recover
her
ease
of
mind
until
she
had
the
certainty
that
she
was
still
beloved
were
her
faith
in
that
unshaken
she
would
be
perfectly
at
rest
if
loved
she
could
bear
anything
a
fit
of
being
charitable
had
again
taken
possession
of
her
so
that
she
was
touched
by
the
slightest
suffering
and
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
ready
to
overflow
at
any
moment
the
old
man
mascart
made
her
give
him
tobacco
and
the
chouarts
drew
from
her
everything
they
wished
even
to
preserved
fruits
but
the
lemballeuses
also
profited
by
her
gifts
and
tiennette
had
been
seen
dancing
at
the
fetes
dressed
in
one
of
the
good
young
lady
s
gowns
and
one
day
as
she
was
taking
to
the
grandmother
some
chemises
promised
her
the
previous
evening
she
saw
from
a
distance
in
the
midst
of
the
poor
family
madame
de
voincourt
and
her
daughter
claire
accompanied
by
felicien
the
latter
no
doubt
had
taken
them
there
she
did
not
show
herself
but
returned
home
at
once
chilled
to
the
heart
two
days
later
she
saw
the
two
again
as
they
came
out
from
the
chateau
then
one
morning
the
old
man
mascart
told
her
of
a
visit
he
had
received
from
the
handsome
young
gentleman
and
two
ladies
then
she
abandoned
her
poor
people
who
seemed
no
longer
to
have
claims
upon
her
since
felicien
had
taken
them
and
given
them
to
his
new
friends
she
gave
up
her
walks
for
fear
she
might
see
them
and
thus
be
so
deeply
wounded
that
her
sufferings
would
be
increased
tenfold
she
felt
as
if
something
were
dying
within
her
as
if
little
by
little
her
very
life
was
passing
away
one
evening
after
one
of
these
meetings
when
alone
in
her
chamber
stifling
from
anguish
she
uttered
this
cry
but
he
loves
me
no
she
saw
before
her
mentally
claire
de
voincourt
tall
beautiful
with
her
crown
of
black
hair
and
he
was
at
her
side
slight
proud
and
handsome
were
they
not
really
created
for
each
other
of
the
same
race
so
well
mated
that
one
might
think
they
were
already
married
he
no
longer
loves
me
oh
he
no
longer
loves
me
this
exclamation
broke
from
her
lips
as
if
it
were
the
ruin
of
all
her
hopes
and
her
faith
once
shaken
everything
gave
way
without
her
being
able
to
examine
the
facts
of
the
case
or
to
regard
them
calmly
the
previous
evening
she
believed
in
something
but
that
had
now
passed
by
a
breath
coming
from
she
knew
not
where
had
been
sufficient
and
all
at
once
by
a
single
blow
she
had
fallen
into
the
greatest
despair
that
of
thinking
she
was
not
beloved
he
had
indeed
spoken
wisely
when
he
told
her
once
that
this
was
the
only
real
grief
the
one
insupportable
torture
now
her
turn
had
come
until
then
she
had
been
resigned
she
felt
so
strong
and
confident
as
she
awaited
the
miracle
but
her
strength
passed
away
with
her
faith
she
was
tormented
by
her
distress
like
a
child
her
whole
being
seemed
to
be
only
an
open
wound
and
a
painful
struggle
commenced
in
her
soul
at
first
she
called
upon
her
pride
to
help
her
she
was
too
proud
to
care
for
him
any
more
she
tried
to
deceive
herself
she
pretended
to
be
free
from
all
care
as
she
sang
while
embroidering
the
hautecoeur
coat
of
arms
upon
which
she
was
at
work
but
her
heart
was
so
full
it
almost
stifled
her
and
she
was
ashamed
to
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
was
weak
enough
to
love
him
still
in
spite
of
all
and
even
to
love
him
more
than
ever
for
a
week
these
armorial
bearings
as
they
grew
thread
by
thread
under
her
fingers
filled
her
with
a
terrible
sorrow
quartered
one
and
four
two
and
three
of
jerusalem
and
d
hautecoeur
of
jerusalem
which
is
argent
a
cross
potence
or
between
four
of
the
last
and
d
hautecoeur
azure
on
a
castle
or
a
shield
sable
charged
with
a
human
heart
argent
the
whole
accompanied
by
three
or
two
at
the
top
and
one
in
the
point
the
enamels
were
made
of
twist
the
metals
of
gold
and
silver
thread
what
misery
it
was
to
feel
that
her
hands
trembled
and
to
be
obliged
to
lower
her
head
to
hide
her
eyes
that
were
blinded
with
tears
from
all
this
brightness
she
thought
only
of
him
she
adored
him
in
the
lustre
of
his
legendary
nobility
and
when
she
embroidered
the
motto
of
the
family
dieu
veult
je
in
black
silk
on
a
streamer
of
silver
she
realised
that
she
was
his
slave
and
that
never
again
could
she
reclaim
him
then
tears
prevented
her
from
seeing
while
mechanically
she
continued
to
make
little
stitches
in
her
work
after
this
it
was
indeed
pitiable
angelique
loved
in
despair
fought
against
this
hopeless
affection
which
she
could
not
destroy
she
still
wished
to
go
to
felicien
to
reconquer
him
by
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
thus
the
contest
was
daily
renewed
sometimes
she
thought
she
had
gained
control
over
her
feelings
so
great
a
silence
appeared
to
have
fallen
within
and
around
her
she
seemed
to
see
herself
as
if
in
a
vision
a
stranger
in
reality
very
little
very
cold
and
kneeling
like
an
obedient
child
in
the
humility
of
renunciation
then
it
was
no
longer
herself
but
a
sensible
young
girl
made
so
by
her
education
and
her
home
life
soon
a
rush
of
blood
mounted
to
her
face
making
her
dizzy
her
perfect
health
the
ardent
feelings
of
her
youth
seemed
to
gallop
like
runaway
colts
and
she
resaw
herself
proud
and
passionate
in
all
the
reality
of
her
unknown
origin
why
then
had
she
been
so
obedient
there
was
no
true
duty
to
consult
only
already
she
had
planned
her
flight
and
calculated
the
most
favourable
hour
for
forcing
open
the
gate
of
the
bishop
s
garden
but
already
also
the
agony
the
grave
uneasiness
the
torment
of
a
doubt
had
come
back
to
her
were
she
to
yield
to
evil
she
would
suffer
eternal
remorse
in
consequence
hours
most
abominable
hours
passed
in
this
uncertainty
as
to
what
part
she
should
take
under
this
tempestuous
wind
which
constantly
threw
her
from
the
revolt
of
her
love
to
the
horror
of
a
fault
and
she
came
out
of
the
contest
weakened
by
each
victory
over
her
heart
one
evening
as
she
was
about
leaving
the
house
to
go
to
join
felicien
she
suddenly
thought
of
her
little
book
from
the
society
of
aid
to
abandoned
children
she
was
so
distressed
to
find
that
she
no
longer
had
strength
to
resist
her
pride
she
took
it
from
the
depths
of
the
chest
of
drawers
turned
over
its
leaves
whispered
to
herself
at
each
page
the
lowness
of
her
birth
so
eager
was
she
in
her
need
of
humility
father
and
mother
unknown
no
name
nothing
but
a
date
and
a
number
a
complete
neglect
like
that
of
a
wild
plant
that
grows
by
the
roadside
then
crowds
of
memories
came
to
her
the
rich
pastures
of
the
mievre
and
the
cows
she
had
watched
there
the
flat
route
of
soulanges
where
she
had
so
often
walked
barefooted
and
maman
nini
who
boxed
her
ears
when
she
stole
apples
certain
pages
specially
attracted
her
by
their
painful
associations
those
which
certified
every
three
months
to
the
visits
of
the
and
of
the
physician
whose
signatures
were
sometimes
accompanied
by
observations
or
information
as
for
instance
a
severe
illness
during
which
she
had
almost
died
a
claim
from
her
nurse
on
the
subject
of
a
pair
of
shoes
that
had
been
burnt
and
bad
marks
that
had
been
given
her
for
her
uncontrollable
temper
it
was
in
short
the
journal
of
her
misery
but
one
thing
disturbed
her
above
all
others
the
report
in
reference
to
the
breaking
of
the
necklace
she
had
worn
until
she
was
six
years
of
age
she
recollected
that
she
had
instinctively
hated
it
this
string
of
beads
of
bone
cut
in
the
shape
of
little
olives
strung
on
a
silken
cord
and
fastened
by
a
medallion
of
plaited
silver
bearing
the
date
of
her
entrance
into
the
home
and
her
number
she
considered
it
as
a
badge
of
slavery
and
tried
several
times
to
break
it
with
her
little
hands
without
any
fear
as
to
the
consequences
of
doing
so
then
when
older
she
complained
that
it
choked
her
for
a
year
longer
she
was
obliged
to
wear
it
great
indeed
was
her
joy
when
in
the
presence
of
the
mayor
of
the
parish
the
inspector
s
aid
had
cut
the
cord
replacing
this
sign
of
individuality
by
a
formal
description
in
which
allusion
was
made
to
her
eyes
and
her
fine
golden
hair
yet
she
always
seemed
to
feel
around
her
neck
this
collar
as
if
she
were
an
animal
that
was
marked
in
order
that
she
might
be
recognised
if
she
went
astray
it
cut
into
her
flesh
and
stifled
her
when
she
came
to
that
page
on
this
day
her
humility
came
back
to
her
she
was
frightened
and
went
up
to
her
chamber
sobbing
as
if
unworthy
of
being
loved
at
two
other
times
this
little
book
saved
her
at
last
it
lost
its
power
and
could
not
help
her
in
checking
her
rebellious
thoughts
now
her
greatest
temptation
came
to
her
at
night
before
going
to
bed
that
her
sleep
might
be
calm
she
imposed
upon
herself
the
task
of
resuming
reading
the
legends
but
resting
her
forehead
on
her
hands
notwithstanding
all
her
efforts
she
could
understand
nothing
the
miracles
stupefied
her
she
saw
only
a
discoloured
flight
of
phantoms
then
in
her
great
bed
after
a
most
intense
prostration
she
started
suddenly
from
her
sleep
in
agony
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
she
sat
upright
distracted
then
knelt
among
the
half
clothes
as
the
perspiration
started
from
her
forehead
while
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
clasping
her
hands
together
she
stammered
in
prayer
oh
my
god
why
have
you
forsaken
me
her
great
distress
was
to
realise
that
she
was
alone
in
the
obscurity
at
such
moments
she
had
dreamed
of
felicien
she
was
eager
to
dress
herself
and
go
to
join
him
before
anyone
could
come
to
prevent
her
from
fleeing
it
was
as
if
the
divine
grace
were
leaving
her
as
if
god
ceased
to
protect
her
and
even
the
elements
abandoned
her
in
despair
she
called
upon
the
unknown
she
listened
attentively
hoping
for
some
sign
from
the
invisible
but
there
was
no
reply
the
air
seemed
empty
there
were
no
more
whispering
voices
no
more
mysterious
rustlings
everything
seemed
to
be
dead
the
with
the
chevrotte
the
willows
the
in
the
bishop
s
garden
and
the
cathedral
itself
nothing
remained
of
the
dreams
she
had
placed
there
the
white
flight
of
her
friends
in
passing
away
left
behind
them
only
their
sepulchre
she
was
in
agony
at
her
powerlessness
disarmed
like
a
christian
of
the
primitive
church
overcome
by
original
sin
as
soon
as
the
aid
of
the
supernatural
had
departed
in
the
dull
silence
of
this
protected
corner
she
heard
this
evil
inheritance
come
back
howling
triumphant
over
everything
if
in
ten
minutes
more
no
help
came
to
her
from
figurative
forces
if
things
around
her
did
not
rouse
up
and
sustain
her
she
would
certainly
succumb
and
go
to
her
ruin
my
god
my
god
why
have
you
abandoned
me
still
kneeling
on
her
bed
slight
and
delicate
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
dying
each
time
until
now
at
the
moment
of
her
greatest
distress
she
had
been
sustained
by
a
certain
freshness
it
was
the
eternal
grace
which
had
pity
upon
her
and
restored
her
illusions
she
jumped
out
on
to
the
floor
with
her
bare
feet
and
ran
eagerly
to
the
window
then
at
last
she
heard
the
voices
rising
again
invisible
wings
brushed
against
her
hair
the
people
of
the
golden
legend
came
out
from
the
trees
and
the
stones
and
crowded
around
her
her
purity
her
goodness
all
that
which
resembled
her
in
nature
returned
to
her
and
saved
her
now
she
was
no
longer
afraid
for
she
knew
that
she
was
watched
over
agnes
had
come
back
with
the
wandering
gentle
virgins
and
in
the
air
she
breathed
was
a
sweet
calmness
which
notwithstanding
her
intense
sadness
strengthened
her
in
her
resolve
to
die
rather
than
fail
in
her
duty
or
break
her
promise
at
last
quite
exhausted
she
crept
back
into
her
bed
falling
asleep
again
with
the
fear
of
the
morrow
s
trials
constantly
tormented
by
the
idea
that
she
must
succumb
in
the
end
if
her
weakness
thus
increased
each
day
in
fact
a
languor
gained
fearfully
upon
angelique
since
she
thought
felicien
no
longer
loved
her
she
was
deeply
wounded
and
silent
uncomplaining
she
seemed
to
be
dying
hourly
at
first
it
showed
itself
by
weariness
she
would
have
an
attack
of
want
of
breath
when
she
was
forced
to
drop
her
thread
and
for
a
moment
remain
with
her
eyes
half
closed
seeing
nothing
although
apparently
looking
straight
before
her
then
she
left
off
eating
scarcely
taking
even
a
little
milk
and
she
either
hid
her
bread
or
gave
it
to
the
neighbours
chickens
that
she
need
not
make
her
parents
anxious
a
physician
having
been
called
found
no
acute
disease
but
considering
her
life
too
solitary
simply
recommended
a
great
deal
of
exercise
it
was
like
a
gradual
fading
away
of
her
whole
being
a
disappearing
by
slow
degrees
an
obliterating
of
her
physique
from
its
immaterial
beauty
her
form
floated
like
the
swaying
of
two
great
wings
a
strong
light
seemed
to
come
from
her
thin
face
where
the
soul
was
burning
she
could
now
come
down
from
her
chamber
only
in
tottering
steps
as
she
supported
herself
by
putting
her
two
hands
against
the
wall
of
the
stairway
but
as
soon
as
she
realised
she
was
being
looked
at
she
made
a
great
effort
and
even
persisted
in
wishing
to
finish
the
panel
of
heavy
embroidery
for
the
bishop
s
seat
her
little
slender
hands
had
no
more
strength
and
when
she
broke
a
needle
she
could
not
draw
it
from
the
work
with
the
pincers
one
morning
when
hubert
and
hubertine
had
been
obliged
to
go
out
and
had
left
her
alone
at
her
work
the
embroiderer
coming
back
first
had
found
her
on
the
floor
near
the
frame
where
she
had
fallen
from
her
chair
after
having
fainted
away
she
had
at
last
succumbed
before
her
task
one
of
the
great
golden
angels
being
still
unfinished
hubert
took
her
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
place
her
on
her
feet
but
she
fell
back
again
and
did
not
recover
consciousness
my
darling
my
darling
speak
to
me
have
pity
on
me
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
in
despair
why
had
he
wished
her
to
come
back
to
life
she
would
so
gladly
die
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
child
have
you
really
deceived
us
do
you
still
love
him
she
made
no
answer
but
simply
looked
at
him
with
intense
sadness
then
he
embraced
her
gently
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
up
to
her
room
having
placed
her
upon
her
bed
when
he
saw
how
white
and
frail
she
was
he
wept
that
he
had
had
so
cruel
a
task
to
perform
as
to
keep
away
from
her
the
one
whom
she
so
loved
but
i
would
have
given
him
to
you
my
dear
why
did
you
say
nothing
to
me
she
did
not
speak
her
eyelids
closed
and
she
appeared
to
fall
asleep
he
remained
standing
his
looks
fixed
upon
the
thin
countenance
his
heart
bleeding
with
pity
then
as
her
breathing
had
become
quiet
he
went
downstairs
as
he
heard
his
wife
come
in
he
explained
everything
to
her
in
the
hubertine
had
just
taken
off
her
hat
and
gloves
and
he
at
once
told
her
of
his
having
found
the
child
on
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
that
she
was
now
sleeping
on
her
bed
overcome
with
weakness
and
almost
lifeless
we
have
really
been
greatly
mistaken
she
thinks
constantly
of
this
young
man
and
it
is
killing
her
by
inches
ah
if
you
knew
what
a
shock
it
gave
me
and
the
remorse
which
has
made
me
almost
distracted
since
i
have
realised
the
truth
of
the
case
and
carried
her
upstairs
in
so
pitiable
a
state
it
is
our
fault
we
have
separated
them
by
falsehoods
and
i
am
not
only
ashamed
but
so
angry
with
myself
it
makes
me
ill
but
what
will
you
let
her
suffer
so
without
saying
anything
to
save
her
still
hubertine
was
as
silent
as
angelique
and
pale
from
anxiety
looked
at
him
calmly
and
soothingly
but
he
always
an
excitable
man
was
now
so
overcome
by
what
he
had
just
seen
that
forgetting
his
usual
submission
he
was
almost
beside
himself
could
not
keep
still
but
threw
his
hands
up
and
down
in
his
feverish
agitation
very
well
then
i
will
speak
and
i
will
tell
her
that
felicien
loves
her
and
that
it
is
we
who
have
had
the
cruelty
to
prevent
him
from
returning
in
deceiving
him
also
now
every
tear
she
sheds
cuts
me
to
the
heart
were
she
to
die
i
should
consider
myself
as
having
been
her
murderer
i
wish
her
to
be
happy
yes
happy
at
any
cost
no
matter
how
but
by
all
possible
he
had
approached
his
wife
and
he
dared
to
cry
out
in
the
revolt
of
his
tenderness
being
doubly
irritated
by
the
sad
silence
she
still
maintained
since
they
love
each
other
it
is
they
alone
who
should
be
masters
of
the
situation
there
is
surely
nothing
in
the
world
greater
than
to
love
and
be
loved
yes
happiness
is
always
at
length
hubertine
standing
motionless
spoke
slowly
you
are
willing
then
that
he
should
take
her
from
us
are
you
not
that
he
should
marry
her
notwithstanding
our
opposition
and
without
the
consent
of
his
father
would
you
advise
them
to
do
so
do
you
think
that
they
would
be
happy
afterwards
and
that
love
would
suffice
them
and
without
changing
her
manner
she
continued
in
the
same
voice
on
my
way
home
i
passed
by
the
cemetery
and
an
undefinable
hope
made
me
enter
there
again
i
knelt
once
more
on
the
spot
that
is
worn
by
our
knees
and
i
prayed
there
for
a
long
hubert
had
turned
very
pale
and
a
cold
chill
replaced
the
fever
of
a
few
moments
before
certainly
he
knew
well
the
tomb
of
the
unforgiving
mother
where
they
had
so
often
been
in
tears
and
in
submission
as
they
accused
themselves
of
their
disobedience
and
besought
the
dead
to
send
them
her
pardon
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
they
had
remained
there
for
hours
sure
that
if
the
grace
they
demanded
were
ever
granted
them
they
would
be
cognisant
of
it
at
once
that
for
which
they
pleaded
that
for
which
they
hoped
was
for
another
infant
a
child
of
pardon
the
only
sign
which
would
assure
them
that
at
last
they
themselves
had
been
forgiven
but
all
was
in
vain
the
cold
hard
mother
was
deaf
to
all
their
entreaties
and
left
them
under
the
inexorable
punishment
of
the
death
of
their
firstborn
whom
she
had
taken
and
carried
away
and
whom
she
refused
to
restore
to
them
i
prayed
there
for
a
long
time
repeated
hubertine
i
listened
eagerly
to
know
if
there
would
not
be
some
slight
hubert
questioned
her
with
an
anxious
look
but
there
was
nothing
no
no
sound
came
up
to
me
from
the
earth
and
within
me
there
was
no
feeling
of
relief
ah
yes
it
is
useless
to
hope
any
longer
it
is
too
late
we
brought
about
our
own
then
trembling
he
asked
do
you
accuse
me
of
it
yes
you
are
to
blame
and
i
also
did
wrong
in
following
you
we
disobeyed
in
the
beginning
and
all
our
life
has
been
spoiled
in
consequence
of
that
one
false
but
are
you
not
happy
no
i
am
not
happy
a
woman
who
has
no
child
can
never
be
happy
to
love
merely
is
not
enough
that
love
must
be
crowned
and
he
had
fallen
into
a
chair
faint
and
overcome
as
tears
came
to
his
eyes
never
before
had
she
reproached
him
for
the
wound
which
marred
their
lives
and
she
who
always
after
having
grieved
him
by
an
involuntary
allusion
to
the
past
had
quickly
recovered
herself
and
consoled
him
this
time
let
him
suffer
looking
at
him
as
she
stood
near
but
making
no
sign
taking
no
step
towards
him
he
wept
bitterly
exclaiming
in
the
midst
of
his
tears
ah
the
dear
child
upstairs
it
is
she
you
condemn
you
are
not
willing
that
felicien
should
marry
her
as
i
married
you
and
that
she
should
suffer
as
you
have
she
answered
simply
by
a
look
a
clear
affectionate
glance
in
which
he
read
the
strength
and
simplicity
of
her
heart
but
you
said
yourself
my
dear
that
our
sweet
daughter
would
die
of
grief
if
matters
were
not
changed
do
you
then
wish
for
her
death
yes
her
death
now
would
be
preferable
to
an
unhappy
he
left
his
seat
and
clasped
her
in
his
arms
as
they
both
sobbed
bitterly
for
some
minutes
they
embraced
each
other
then
he
conquered
himself
and
she
in
her
turn
was
obliged
to
lean
upon
his
shoulder
that
he
might
comfort
her
and
renew
her
courage
they
were
indeed
distressed
but
were
firm
in
their
decision
to
keep
perfectly
silent
and
if
it
were
god
s
will
that
their
child
must
die
in
consequence
they
must
accept
it
submissively
rather
than
advise
her
to
do
wrong
from
that
day
angelique
was
obliged
to
keep
in
her
room
her
weakness
increased
so
rapidly
and
to
such
a
degree
that
she
could
no
longer
go
down
to
the
workroom
did
she
attempt
to
walk
her
head
became
dizzy
at
once
and
her
limbs
bent
under
her
at
first
by
the
aid
of
the
furniture
she
was
able
to
get
to
the
balcony
later
she
was
obliged
to
content
herself
with
going
from
her
armchair
to
her
bed
even
that
distance
seemed
long
to
her
and
she
only
tried
it
in
the
morning
and
evening
she
was
so
exhausted
however
she
still
worked
giving
up
the
embroidery
in
as
being
too
difficult
and
simply
making
use
of
coloured
silks
she
copied
flowers
after
nature
from
a
bunch
of
hydrangeas
and
hollyhocks
which
having
no
odour
she
could
keep
in
her
room
the
bouquet
was
in
full
bloom
in
a
large
vase
and
often
she
would
rest
for
several
minutes
as
she
looked
at
it
with
pleasure
for
even
the
light
silks
were
too
heavy
for
her
fingers
in
two
days
she
had
made
one
flower
which
was
fresh
and
bright
as
it
shone
upon
the
satin
but
this
occupation
was
her
life
and
she
would
use
her
needle
until
her
last
breath
softened
by
suffering
emaciated
by
the
inner
fever
that
was
consuming
her
she
seemed
now
to
be
but
a
spirit
a
pure
and
beautiful
flame
that
would
soon
be
extinguished
why
was
it
necessary
to
struggle
any
longer
if
felicien
did
not
love
her
now
she
was
dying
with
this
conviction
not
only
had
he
no
love
for
her
but
perhaps
he
had
never
really
cared
for
her
so
long
as
her
strength
lasted
she
had
contended
against
her
heart
her
health
and
her
youth
all
of
which
urged
her
to
go
and
join
him
but
now
that
she
was
unable
to
move
she
must
resign
herself
and
accept
her
fate
one
morning
as
hubert
placed
her
in
her
easy
chair
and
put
a
cushion
under
her
little
motionless
feet
she
said
with
a
smile
ah
i
am
sure
of
being
good
now
and
not
trying
to
run
hubert
hastened
to
go
downstairs
that
she
might
not
see
his
tears
chapter
xv
it
was
impossible
for
angelique
to
sleep
that
night
a
nervous
wakefulness
kept
her
burning
eyelids
from
closing
and
her
extreme
weakness
seemed
greater
than
ever
the
huberts
had
gone
to
their
room
and
at
last
when
it
was
near
midnight
so
great
a
fear
came
over
her
that
she
would
die
if
she
were
to
remain
longer
in
bed
she
preferred
to
get
up
notwithstanding
the
immense
effort
required
to
do
so
she
was
almost
stifled
putting
on
a
and
warm
slippers
she
crept
along
slowly
as
far
as
the
window
which
she
opened
wide
the
winter
was
somewhat
rainy
but
of
a
mild
dampness
so
the
air
was
pleasant
to
breathe
she
sank
back
into
her
great
armchair
after
having
turned
up
the
wick
of
a
lamp
which
was
on
a
table
near
her
and
which
was
always
allowed
to
be
kept
burning
during
the
entire
night
there
by
the
side
of
the
volume
of
the
golden
legend
was
the
bouquet
of
hydrangeas
and
hollyhocks
which
she
had
begun
to
copy
that
she
might
once
more
attach
herself
to
the
life
which
she
realised
was
fast
passing
from
her
she
had
a
sudden
fancy
to
work
and
drawing
her
frame
forward
she
made
a
few
stitches
with
her
trembling
fingers
the
red
silk
of
the
seemed
of
a
deeper
hue
than
ever
in
contrast
with
her
white
hands
it
was
almost
as
if
it
were
the
blood
from
her
veins
which
was
quietly
flowing
away
drop
by
drop
but
she
who
for
two
hours
had
turned
in
vain
from
side
to
side
in
the
burning
bedclothes
yielded
almost
immediately
to
sleep
as
soon
as
she
was
seated
her
head
drooped
a
little
toward
her
right
shoulder
being
supported
by
the
back
of
her
chair
and
the
silk
remaining
in
her
motionless
hands
a
would
have
thought
she
was
still
embroidering
white
as
snow
perfectly
calm
she
slept
under
the
light
of
the
lamp
in
the
chamber
still
and
quiet
as
a
tomb
the
faded
rosy
draperies
of
the
great
royal
couch
were
paler
than
ever
in
their
shady
corner
and
the
gloom
of
the
walls
of
the
room
was
only
relieved
by
the
great
chest
of
drawers
the
wardrobe
and
the
chairs
of
old
carved
oak
minutes
passed
her
slumber
was
deep
and
dreamless
at
last
there
was
a
slight
sound
and
felicien
suddenly
appeared
on
the
balcony
pale
trembling
and
like
herself
looking
very
worn
and
thin
and
his
countenance
distressed
when
he
saw
her
reclining
in
the
easy
chair
pitiable
and
yet
so
beautiful
to
look
at
he
rushed
at
once
into
the
chamber
and
his
heart
grew
heavy
with
infinite
grief
as
he
went
forward
and
falling
on
his
knees
before
her
gazed
at
her
with
an
expression
of
utter
despair
could
it
be
that
she
was
so
hopelessly
ill
was
it
unhappiness
that
had
caused
her
to
be
so
weak
and
to
have
wasted
way
to
such
a
degree
that
she
appeared
to
him
light
as
air
while
she
lay
there
like
a
feather
which
the
slightest
breath
would
blow
away
in
her
sleep
her
suffering
and
her
patient
resignation
were
clearly
seen
he
in
fact
would
have
known
her
only
by
her
grace
the
delicate
outlines
of
her
neck
her
drooping
shoulders
and
her
oval
face
transfigured
like
that
of
a
youthful
virgin
mounting
towards
heaven
her
exquisite
hair
was
now
only
a
mass
of
light
and
her
pure
soul
shone
under
the
soft
transparency
of
her
skin
she
had
all
the
ethereal
beauty
of
the
saints
relieved
from
their
bodies
he
was
both
dazzled
and
distressed
the
violent
shock
rendered
him
incapable
of
moving
and
with
hands
clasped
he
remained
silent
she
did
not
awake
as
he
continued
to
watch
her
a
little
air
from
the
lips
of
felicien
must
have
passed
across
angelique
s
face
as
all
at
once
she
opened
her
great
eyes
yet
she
did
not
start
but
in
her
turn
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
as
if
he
were
a
vision
yes
it
was
he
she
recognised
him
well
although
he
was
greatly
changed
but
she
did
not
think
she
was
awake
for
she
often
saw
him
thus
in
her
dreams
and
her
trouble
was
increased
when
rousing
from
her
sleep
she
realised
the
truth
he
held
his
hands
out
towards
her
and
spoke
my
dearest
i
love
you
i
was
told
that
you
were
ill
and
came
to
you
immediately
look
at
me
here
i
am
and
i
love
she
straightened
herself
up
quickly
she
shuddered
as
with
a
mechanical
movement
she
passed
her
fingers
over
her
eyes
doubt
no
longer
then
see
me
at
your
feet
and
realise
that
i
love
you
now
as
i
have
ever
then
she
exclaimed
oh
is
it
you
i
had
given
up
expecting
you
and
yet
you
are
with
her
feeble
trembling
hands
she
had
taken
his
thus
assuring
herself
that
he
was
not
a
fanciful
vision
of
her
sleep
he
continued
you
have
always
loved
me
and
i
love
you
for
ever
yes
notwithstanding
everything
and
more
deeply
even
than
i
should
have
ever
thought
it
possible
to
it
was
an
excess
of
happiness
and
in
this
first
minute
of
absolute
joy
they
forgot
everything
else
in
the
world
giving
themselves
up
to
the
delightful
certainty
of
their
mutual
affection
and
their
ability
to
declare
it
the
sufferings
of
the
past
the
obstacles
of
the
future
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
they
did
not
even
think
of
asking
how
it
was
that
they
had
thus
come
together
but
there
they
were
mingling
their
tears
of
joy
together
as
they
embraced
each
other
with
the
purest
of
feelings
he
was
overcome
with
pity
that
she
was
so
worn
by
grief
and
illness
that
she
seemed
like
a
mere
shadow
in
his
arms
in
the
enchantment
of
her
surprise
she
remained
trembling
from
exhaustion
radiant
with
spiritual
beauty
as
she
lay
back
in
her
great
easy
chair
so
physically
weary
that
she
could
not
raise
herself
without
falling
again
but
intoxicated
with
this
supreme
contentment
ah
dear
seigneur
my
only
remaining
wish
is
gratified
i
longed
to
see
you
before
death
he
lifted
up
his
head
as
with
a
despairing
movement
and
said
do
not
speak
of
dying
it
shall
not
be
i
am
here
and
i
love
she
smiled
angelically
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
now
that
you
have
assured
me
of
your
affection
the
idea
no
longer
terrifies
me
i
could
easily
fall
asleep
in
this
way
while
leaning
on
your
shoulders
tell
me
once
more
that
you
love
i
love
you
as
deeply
as
i
loved
you
yesterday
and
as
i
will
love
you
on
the
morrow
do
not
doubt
it
for
one
moment
for
it
is
for
eternity
oh
yes
we
will
love
each
other
for
ever
and
angelique
was
enraptured
and
with
vague
eyes
looked
directly
before
her
as
if
seeing
something
beyond
the
cold
whiteness
of
the
chamber
but
evidently
she
aroused
herself
as
if
just
awaking
from
sleep
in
the
midst
of
this
great
felicity
which
had
appeased
her
she
had
now
had
time
for
reflection
the
true
facts
of
the
case
astonished
her
you
have
loved
me
yet
why
did
you
not
at
once
come
to
see
me
your
parents
said
that
you
cared
for
me
no
longer
i
also
nearly
died
when
learning
that
at
last
i
was
determined
to
know
the
whole
truth
and
was
sent
away
from
the
house
the
door
being
absolutely
closed
against
me
and
i
was
forbidden
to
then
they
shut
the
door
in
your
face
yet
my
mother
told
me
that
you
did
not
love
me
and
i
could
but
believe
her
since
having
seen
you
several
times
with
that
young
lady
mademoiselle
claire
i
thought
naturally
you
were
obeying
your
no
i
was
waiting
but
it
was
cowardly
on
my
part
thus
to
tremble
before
him
my
great
mistake
has
been
to
allow
the
matter
to
go
so
far
for
my
duty
was
to
have
trusted
only
in
you
to
have
insisted
upon
seeing
you
personally
and
to
have
acted
with
there
was
a
short
silence
angelique
sat
erect
for
an
instant
as
if
she
had
received
a
blow
and
her
expression
grew
cold
and
hard
and
her
forehead
was
cut
by
an
angry
wrinkle
so
we
have
both
of
us
been
deceived
falsehoods
have
been
told
in
order
to
separate
us
from
each
other
notwithstanding
our
mutual
love
we
have
been
tortured
to
such
a
degree
that
they
have
almost
killed
us
both
very
well
then
it
is
abominable
and
it
frees
us
from
the
promises
we
made
we
are
now
at
liberty
to
act
as
we
an
intense
feeling
of
contempt
so
excited
her
that
she
stood
up
on
her
feet
she
no
longer
realised
that
she
was
ill
but
appeared
to
have
regained
her
strength
miraculously
in
the
reawakening
of
all
the
passion
and
pride
of
her
nature
to
have
thought
her
dream
ended
and
all
at
once
to
have
it
in
its
full
beauty
and
vitality
delighted
her
to
be
able
to
say
that
they
had
done
nothing
unworthy
of
their
love
but
that
it
was
other
persons
who
had
been
the
guilty
ones
was
a
comfort
this
growth
of
herself
this
at
last
certain
triumph
exalted
her
and
threw
her
into
a
supreme
rebellion
she
simply
said
come
let
us
and
she
walked
around
the
room
brave
in
the
return
of
her
energy
and
her
will
she
had
already
selected
a
mantle
to
throw
over
her
shoulders
a
lace
scarf
would
be
sufficient
for
her
head
felicien
uttered
one
cry
of
joy
as
she
thus
anticipated
his
desire
he
had
merely
thought
of
this
flight
but
had
not
had
the
boldness
to
dare
propose
it
and
how
delightful
indeed
it
would
be
to
go
away
together
to
disappear
and
thus
put
an
end
to
all
cares
to
overcome
all
obstacles
the
sooner
it
was
done
the
better
for
then
they
would
avoid
having
to
contend
with
reflection
or
afterthought
yes
darling
let
us
go
immediately
i
was
coming
to
take
you
i
know
where
we
can
find
a
carriage
before
daylight
we
will
be
far
away
so
far
that
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
overtake
she
opened
her
drawers
but
closed
them
again
violently
without
taking
anything
therefrom
as
her
excitement
increased
could
it
be
possible
that
she
had
suffered
such
torture
for
so
many
weeks
she
had
done
everything
in
her
power
to
drive
him
from
her
mind
to
try
to
convince
herself
that
he
cared
no
more
for
her
until
at
last
she
thought
she
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
all
this
abominable
work
must
be
done
over
again
no
she
could
never
have
strength
sufficient
for
that
since
they
loved
each
other
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
was
to
be
married
and
then
no
power
on
earth
could
separate
them
let
me
see
what
ought
i
to
take
oh
how
foolish
i
have
been
with
all
my
childish
scruples
when
i
think
that
others
have
lowered
themselves
so
much
as
even
to
tell
us
falsehoods
yes
even
were
i
to
have
died
they
would
not
have
called
you
to
me
but
tell
me
must
i
take
linen
and
dresses
see
here
is
a
warmer
gown
what
strange
ideas
what
unnumbered
obstacles
they
put
in
my
head
there
was
good
on
one
side
and
evil
on
the
other
things
which
one
might
do
and
again
that
which
one
should
never
do
in
short
such
a
complication
of
matters
it
was
enough
to
make
one
wild
they
were
all
falsehoods
there
was
no
truth
in
any
of
them
the
only
real
happiness
is
to
live
to
love
the
one
who
loves
you
and
to
obey
the
promptings
of
the
heart
you
are
the
personification
of
fortune
of
beauty
and
of
youth
my
dear
seigneur
my
only
pleasure
is
in
you
i
give
myself
to
you
freely
and
you
may
do
with
me
what
you
she
rejoiced
in
this
of
all
the
hereditary
tendencies
of
her
nature
which
she
thought
had
died
within
her
sounds
of
distant
music
excited
her
she
saw
as
it
were
their
royal
departure
this
son
of
a
prince
carrying
her
away
as
in
a
and
making
her
queen
of
some
imaginary
realm
and
she
was
ready
to
follow
him
with
her
arms
clasped
around
his
neck
her
head
upon
his
breast
with
such
a
trembling
from
intense
feeling
that
her
whole
body
grew
weak
from
happiness
to
be
alone
together
just
they
two
to
abandon
themselves
to
the
galloping
of
horses
to
flee
away
and
to
disappear
in
each
other
s
arms
what
perfect
bliss
it
would
be
is
it
not
better
for
me
to
take
nothing
what
good
would
it
do
in
reality
he
partaking
of
her
feverishness
was
already
at
the
door
as
he
replied
no
no
take
nothing
whatever
let
us
go
at
yes
let
us
go
that
is
the
best
thing
to
and
she
rejoined
him
but
she
turned
round
wishing
to
give
a
last
look
at
the
chamber
the
lamp
was
burning
with
the
same
soft
light
the
bouquet
of
hydrangeas
and
hollyhocks
was
blooming
as
ever
and
in
her
the
unfinished
rose
bright
and
natural
as
life
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
her
but
the
room
itself
especially
affected
her
never
before
had
it
seemed
so
white
and
pure
to
her
the
walls
the
bed
the
air
even
appeared
as
if
filled
with
a
clear
white
breath
something
within
her
wavered
and
she
was
obliged
to
lean
heavily
against
the
back
of
a
chair
that
was
near
her
and
not
far
from
the
door
what
is
the
matter
asked
felicien
anxiously
she
did
not
reply
but
breathed
with
great
difficulty
then
seized
with
a
trembling
she
could
no
longer
bear
her
weight
on
her
feet
but
was
forced
to
sit
down
do
not
be
anxious
it
is
nothing
i
only
want
to
rest
for
a
minute
and
then
we
will
they
were
silent
she
continued
to
look
round
the
room
as
if
she
had
forgotten
some
valuable
object
there
but
could
not
tell
what
it
was
it
was
a
regret
at
first
slight
but
which
rapidly
increased
and
filled
her
heart
by
degrees
until
it
almost
stifled
her
she
could
no
longer
collect
her
thoughts
was
it
this
mass
of
whiteness
that
kept
her
back
she
had
always
adored
white
even
to
such
a
degree
as
to
collect
bits
of
silk
and
revel
over
them
in
secret
one
moment
just
one
moment
more
and
we
will
go
away
my
dear
but
she
did
not
even
make
an
effort
to
rise
very
anxious
he
again
knelt
before
her
are
you
suffering
my
dear
can
not
i
do
something
to
make
you
feel
better
if
you
are
shivering
because
you
are
cold
i
will
take
your
little
feet
in
my
hands
and
will
so
warm
them
that
they
will
grow
strong
and
be
able
to
she
shook
her
head
as
she
replied
no
no
i
am
not
cold
i
could
walk
but
please
wait
a
little
just
a
single
he
saw
well
that
invisible
chains
seemed
again
to
have
taken
possession
of
her
limbs
and
little
by
little
were
attaching
themselves
so
strongly
to
her
that
very
soon
perhaps
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
draw
her
away
yet
if
he
did
not
take
her
from
there
at
once
if
they
did
not
flee
together
he
thought
of
the
inevitable
contest
with
his
father
on
the
morrow
of
the
distressing
interview
before
which
he
had
recoiled
for
weeks
past
then
he
became
pressing
and
besought
her
most
ardently
come
dear
the
highways
are
not
light
at
this
hour
the
carriage
will
bear
us
away
in
the
darkness
and
we
will
go
on
and
on
cradled
in
each
other
s
arms
sleeping
as
if
warmly
covered
with
down
not
fearing
the
night
s
freshness
and
when
the
day
dawns
we
will
continue
our
route
in
the
sunshine
as
we
go
still
farther
on
until
we
reach
the
country
where
people
are
always
happy
no
one
will
know
us
there
we
will
live
by
ourselves
lost
in
some
great
garden
having
no
other
care
than
to
love
each
other
more
deeply
than
ever
at
the
coming
of
each
new
day
we
shall
find
flowers
as
large
as
trees
fruits
sweeter
than
honey
and
we
will
live
on
nothing
for
in
the
midst
of
this
eternal
spring
dear
soul
we
will
live
on
our
she
trembled
under
these
burning
words
with
which
he
heated
her
face
and
her
whole
being
seemed
to
be
fainting
away
at
the
representation
of
these
promised
joys
oh
in
a
few
minutes
i
will
be
ready
but
wait
a
little
then
if
journeying
fatigues
us
we
will
come
back
here
we
will
rebuild
the
chateau
d
hautecoeur
and
we
will
pass
the
rest
of
our
lives
there
that
is
my
ideal
dream
if
it
is
necessary
we
will
spend
willingly
all
our
fortune
therein
once
more
shall
its
donjon
overlook
from
its
height
the
two
valleys
we
will
make
our
home
in
the
pavilion
d
honneur
between
the
tower
of
david
and
the
tower
of
charlemagne
the
colossal
edifice
shall
be
restored
as
in
the
days
of
its
primitive
power
the
galleries
the
dwellings
the
chapels
shall
appear
in
the
same
barbaric
luxury
as
before
and
i
shall
wish
for
us
to
lead
the
life
of
olden
times
you
a
princess
and
i
a
prince
surrounded
by
a
large
company
of
armed
vassals
and
of
pages
our
walls
of
fifteen
feet
of
thickness
will
isolate
us
and
we
shall
be
as
our
ancestors
were
of
whom
it
is
written
in
the
legend
when
the
sun
goes
down
behind
the
hills
we
will
return
from
hunting
mounted
on
great
white
horses
greeted
respectfully
by
the
peasants
as
they
kneel
before
us
the
horn
will
resound
in
welcome
the
drawbridge
will
be
lowered
for
us
in
the
evening
kings
will
dine
at
our
table
at
night
our
couch
will
be
on
a
platform
surmounted
by
a
canopy
like
a
throne
while
we
sleep
peacefully
in
purple
and
gold
soft
music
will
be
played
in
the
quivering
with
pride
and
pleasure
she
smiled
now
but
soon
overcome
by
the
great
suffering
that
again
took
possession
of
her
her
lips
assumed
a
mournful
expression
and
the
smile
disappeared
as
with
a
mechanical
movement
of
her
hands
she
drove
away
the
tempting
pictures
he
called
forth
he
redoubled
his
ardour
and
wished
to
make
her
his
by
seizing
her
and
carrying
her
away
in
his
arms
come
dear
come
with
me
let
us
go
and
forget
everything
but
our
united
disengaging
herself
brusquely
she
escaped
him
with
an
instinctive
rebellion
and
trying
to
stand
up
this
cry
came
at
last
from
her
no
no
i
can
not
go
i
no
longer
have
the
power
to
do
however
again
lamenting
her
fate
still
torn
by
the
contest
in
her
soul
hesitating
and
stammering
she
again
turned
towards
him
imploringly
i
beg
you
to
be
good
and
not
hurry
me
too
much
but
wait
awhile
i
would
so
gladly
obey
you
in
order
to
prove
to
you
my
love
i
would
like
above
all
to
go
away
on
your
arm
to
that
beautiful
country
where
we
could
live
royally
in
the
castle
of
your
dreams
it
seems
to
me
an
easy
thing
to
do
so
often
have
i
myself
planned
our
flight
yet
now
what
shall
i
say
to
you
it
appears
to
me
quite
an
impossibility
it
is
as
if
a
door
had
suddenly
been
walled
up
between
us
and
prevented
me
from
going
he
wished
to
try
to
fascinate
her
again
but
she
quieted
him
with
a
movement
of
her
hands
no
do
not
say
anything
more
it
is
very
singular
but
in
proportion
as
you
utter
such
sweet
such
tender
words
which
ought
to
convince
me
fear
takes
possession
of
me
and
chills
me
to
the
heart
my
god
what
is
the
matter
with
me
it
is
really
that
which
you
say
which
drives
me
from
you
if
you
continue
i
can
no
longer
listen
to
you
you
will
be
obliged
to
go
away
yet
wait
wait
a
little
longer
she
walked
very
slowly
about
the
room
anxiously
seeking
to
resume
her
while
he
looked
at
her
in
despair
i
thought
to
have
loved
you
no
longer
but
it
was
certainly
only
a
feeling
of
pique
since
just
now
as
soon
as
i
found
you
again
at
my
feet
my
heart
beat
rapidly
and
my
first
impulse
was
to
follow
you
as
if
i
were
your
slave
then
if
i
love
you
why
am
i
afraid
of
you
what
is
it
that
prevents
me
from
leaving
this
room
as
if
invisible
hands
were
holding
me
back
by
my
whole
body
and
even
by
each
hair
of
my
head
she
had
stopped
near
her
bed
then
she
went
as
far
as
the
wardrobe
then
to
the
different
articles
of
furniture
one
after
the
other
they
all
seemed
united
to
her
person
by
invisible
ties
especially
the
walls
of
the
room
the
grand
whiteness
of
the
mansard
roof
enveloped
her
with
a
robe
of
purity
that
she
could
leave
behind
her
only
with
tears
and
henceforth
all
this
would
be
a
part
of
her
being
the
spirit
of
her
surroundings
had
entered
into
her
and
she
realised
this
fact
stronger
than
ever
when
she
found
herself
opposite
her
which
was
resting
at
the
side
of
the
table
under
the
lamplight
her
heart
softened
as
she
saw
the
rose
which
she
would
never
finish
were
she
to
go
away
in
this
secret
criminal
manner
the
years
of
work
were
brought
back
to
her
mind
those
quiet
happy
years
during
which
life
had
been
one
long
experience
of
peace
and
honesty
so
that
now
she
rebelled
at
the
thought
of
committing
a
fault
and
of
thus
fleeing
in
the
arms
of
her
lover
each
day
in
this
little
fresh
house
of
the
embroiderers
the
active
and
pure
life
she
had
led
there
away
from
all
worldly
temptations
had
as
it
were
made
over
all
the
blood
in
her
veins
then
felicien
realising
that
in
some
inexplicable
way
angelique
was
being
reconquered
and
brought
to
her
better
self
felt
the
necessity
of
hastening
their
departure
he
seized
her
hands
and
said
come
dear
time
passes
quickly
if
we
wait
much
longer
it
will
be
too
she
looked
at
him
an
instant
and
then
in
a
flash
realised
her
true
position
freeing
herself
from
his
grasp
she
exclaimed
resolutely
and
frankly
it
is
already
too
late
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
i
am
unable
now
to
follow
you
once
my
nature
was
so
proud
and
passionate
that
i
could
have
thrown
my
two
arms
around
your
neck
in
order
that
you
might
carry
me
away
all
the
more
quickly
but
now
i
am
no
longer
the
same
person
i
am
so
changed
that
i
do
not
recognise
myself
yes
i
realise
now
that
it
is
this
quiet
corner
where
i
have
been
brought
up
and
the
education
that
has
been
given
me
that
has
made
me
what
i
am
at
present
do
you
then
yourself
hear
nothing
do
you
not
know
that
everything
in
this
chamber
calls
upon
me
to
stay
and
i
do
not
rebel
in
the
least
against
this
demand
for
my
joy
at
last
is
to
without
speaking
without
attempting
to
discuss
the
question
with
her
he
tried
to
take
her
hands
again
and
to
lead
her
like
an
intractable
child
again
she
avoided
him
and
turned
slowly
toward
the
window
no
i
beseech
you
to
leave
me
it
is
not
my
hand
that
you
wish
for
it
is
my
heart
and
also
that
of
my
own
free
will
i
shall
at
once
go
away
with
you
but
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
do
not
wish
to
do
so
a
while
ago
i
thought
to
have
been
as
eager
for
flight
as
you
are
but
sure
of
my
true
self
now
i
know
it
was
only
the
last
rebellion
the
agony
of
the
old
nature
within
me
that
has
just
died
little
by
little
without
my
knowledge
the
good
traits
of
my
character
have
been
drawn
together
and
strongly
united
humility
duty
and
renunciation
so
at
each
return
of
hereditary
tendency
to
excess
the
struggle
has
been
less
severe
and
i
have
triumphed
over
temptation
more
easily
now
at
last
everything
assures
me
that
the
supreme
contest
has
just
taken
place
that
henceforth
it
is
finished
for
ever
i
have
conquered
myself
and
my
nature
is
freed
from
the
evil
tendencies
it
had
ah
dear
seigneur
i
love
you
so
much
do
not
let
us
do
the
slightest
thing
to
mar
our
happiness
to
be
happy
it
is
always
necessary
to
as
he
took
another
step
towards
her
she
was
at
the
threshold
of
the
great
window
which
was
now
wide
open
on
to
the
balcony
she
had
stopped
him
with
a
as
she
said
you
would
not
like
to
force
me
to
throw
myself
down
from
here
listen
and
understand
me
when
i
say
to
you
that
everything
which
surrounds
me
is
on
my
side
i
have
already
told
you
that
for
a
long
time
objects
themselves
have
spoken
to
me
i
hear
voices
in
all
directions
and
never
have
they
been
so
distinct
as
at
this
moment
hear
it
is
the
whole
that
encourages
me
not
to
spoil
my
life
and
yours
by
giving
myself
to
you
without
the
consent
of
your
father
this
singing
voice
is
the
chevrotte
so
clear
and
so
fresh
that
it
seems
to
have
put
within
me
a
purity
like
crystal
since
i
have
lived
so
near
it
this
other
voice
like
that
of
a
crowd
tender
and
deep
it
is
that
of
the
entire
earth
the
grasses
the
trees
all
the
peaceable
life
of
this
sacred
corner
which
has
so
constantly
worked
for
the
good
of
my
soul
and
there
are
other
voices
which
come
from
still
farther
away
from
the
elms
of
the
garden
of
monseigneur
and
from
this
horizon
of
branches
the
smallest
of
which
interests
itself
in
me
and
wishes
for
me
to
be
victorious
then
again
this
great
sovereign
voice
it
is
that
of
my
old
friend
the
cathedral
who
eternally
awake
both
day
and
night
has
taught
me
many
important
things
each
one
of
the
stones
in
the
immense
building
the
little
columns
in
the
windows
the
of
its
piers
the
flying
buttresses
of
its
apse
all
have
a
murmur
which
i
can
distinguish
a
language
which
i
understand
listen
to
what
they
say
that
hope
remains
even
in
death
when
one
is
really
humble
love
alone
remains
and
triumphs
and
at
last
look
the
air
itself
is
filled
with
the
whisperings
of
spirits
see
here
are
my
invisible
companions
the
virgins
who
are
ever
near
me
and
aid
me
listen
listen
smiling
she
had
lifted
up
her
hand
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
attention
and
her
whole
being
was
in
ecstasy
from
the
scattered
breathings
she
heard
they
were
the
virgins
of
the
golden
legend
that
her
imagination
called
forth
as
in
her
early
childhood
and
whose
mystic
flight
came
from
the
old
book
with
its
quaint
pictures
that
was
placed
on
the
little
table
agnes
was
first
clothed
with
her
beautiful
hair
having
on
her
finger
the
ring
of
betrothal
to
the
priest
paulin
then
all
the
others
came
in
turn
barbara
with
her
tower
genevieve
with
her
sheep
cecilia
with
her
viol
agatha
with
her
wounded
breast
elizabeth
begging
on
the
highways
and
catherine
triumphing
over
the
learned
doctors
she
did
not
forget
the
miracle
that
made
lucy
so
heavy
that
a
thousand
men
and
five
yoke
of
oxen
could
not
carry
her
away
nor
the
governor
who
became
blind
as
he
tried
to
embrace
anastasia
then
others
who
seemed
flying
through
the
quiet
night
still
bearing
marks
of
the
wounds
inflicted
upon
them
by
their
cruel
martyrdom
and
from
which
rivers
of
milk
were
flowing
instead
of
blood
ah
to
die
from
love
like
them
to
die
in
the
purity
of
youth
at
the
first
kiss
of
a
beloved
one
felicien
had
approached
her
i
am
the
one
person
who
really
lives
angelique
and
you
can
not
give
me
up
for
mere
dreams
fancies
she
murmured
yes
for
if
in
reality
these
visions
seem
to
surround
you
it
is
simply
that
you
yourself
have
created
them
all
come
dear
no
longer
put
a
part
of
your
life
into
objects
about
you
and
they
will
be
she
gave
way
to
a
burst
of
enthusiastic
feeling
oh
no
let
them
speak
let
them
call
out
louder
still
they
are
my
strength
they
give
me
the
courage
to
resist
you
it
is
a
manifestation
of
the
eternal
grace
and
never
has
it
overpowered
me
so
energetically
as
now
if
it
is
but
a
dream
a
dream
which
i
have
placed
in
my
surroundings
and
which
comes
back
to
me
at
will
what
of
it
it
saves
me
it
carries
me
away
spotless
in
the
midst
of
dangers
listen
yourself
yield
and
obey
like
me
i
no
longer
have
even
a
wish
to
follow
in
spite
of
her
weakness
she
made
a
great
effort
and
stood
up
resolute
and
firm
but
you
have
been
deceived
he
said
even
falsehood
has
been
resorted
to
in
order
to
separate
us
the
faults
of
others
will
not
excuse
our
ah
you
have
withdrawn
your
heart
from
me
and
you
love
me
no
i
love
you
i
oppose
you
only
on
account
of
our
love
and
for
our
mutual
happiness
obtain
the
consent
of
your
father
then
come
for
me
and
i
will
follow
you
no
matter
my
father
you
do
not
know
him
god
only
could
ever
make
him
yield
tell
me
then
is
this
really
to
be
the
end
of
everything
if
my
father
orders
me
to
marry
claire
de
voincourt
must
i
in
that
case
obey
him
at
this
last
blow
angelique
tottered
was
no
torture
to
be
spared
her
she
could
not
restrain
this
heartbroken
cry
oh
that
is
too
much
my
sufferings
are
greater
than
i
can
bear
i
beseech
you
go
away
quickly
and
do
not
be
so
cruel
why
did
you
come
at
all
i
was
resigned
i
had
learned
to
accept
the
misfortune
of
being
no
longer
loved
by
you
yet
the
moment
that
i
am
reassured
of
your
affection
all
my
martyrdom
recommences
and
how
can
you
expect
me
to
live
now
felicien
not
aware
of
the
depth
of
her
despair
and
thinking
that
she
had
yielded
simply
to
a
momentary
feeling
repeated
his
question
if
my
father
wishes
me
to
marry
her
she
struggled
heroically
against
her
intense
suffering
she
succeeded
in
standing
up
notwithstanding
that
her
heart
was
crushed
and
dragging
herself
slowly
towards
the
table
as
if
to
make
room
for
him
to
pass
her
she
said
marry
her
for
it
is
always
necessary
to
in
his
turn
he
was
now
before
the
window
ready
to
take
his
departure
because
she
had
sent
him
away
from
her
but
it
will
make
you
die
if
i
do
she
had
regained
her
calmness
and
smiling
sadly
she
replied
oh
that
work
is
nearly
done
for
one
moment
more
he
looked
at
her
so
pale
so
thin
so
wan
light
as
a
feather
to
be
carried
away
by
the
faintest
breath
then
with
a
brusque
movement
of
furious
resolution
he
disappeared
in
the
night
when
he
was
no
longer
there
angelique
leaning
against
the
back
of
her
armchair
stretched
her
hands
out
in
agony
towards
the
darkness
and
her
frail
body
was
shaken
by
heavy
sobs
and
cold
perspiration
came
out
upon
her
face
and
neck
my
god
this
then
was
the
end
and
she
would
never
see
him
again
all
her
weakness
and
pain
had
come
back
to
her
her
exhausted
limbs
no
longer
supported
her
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
she
could
regain
her
bed
upon
which
she
fell
helpless
but
calm
in
spirit
from
the
assurance
that
she
had
done
right
the
next
morning
they
found
her
there
dying
the
lamp
had
just
gone
out
of
itself
at
the
dawn
of
day
and
everything
in
the
chamber
was
of
a
triumphal
whiteness
chapter
xvi
angelique
was
dying
it
was
ten
o
clock
one
cold
morning
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
the
air
was
sharp
and
the
clear
heavens
were
brightened
up
by
the
beautiful
sunshine
in
her
great
royal
bed
draped
with
its
old
faded
chintz
she
lay
motionless
having
been
unconscious
during
the
whole
night
stretched
upon
her
back
her
little
hands
carelessly
thrown
upon
the
sheet
she
no
longer
even
opened
her
eyes
and
her
profile
looked
more
delicate
than
ever
under
the
golden
halo
of
her
hair
in
fact
anyone
who
had
seen
her
would
have
thought
her
already
dead
had
it
not
been
for
the
slight
breathing
movement
of
her
lips
the
day
before
angelique
realising
that
she
was
very
ill
had
confessed
and
partaken
of
the
communion
towards
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
good
abbe
cornille
had
brought
to
her
the
sacred
then
in
the
evening
as
the
chill
of
death
gradually
crept
over
her
a
great
desire
came
to
her
to
receive
the
extreme
unction
that
celestial
remedy
instituted
for
the
cure
of
both
the
soul
and
body
before
losing
consciousness
her
last
words
scarcely
murmured
were
understood
by
hubertine
as
in
hesitating
sentences
she
expressed
her
wish
for
the
holy
oils
yes
oh
yes
as
quickly
as
possible
before
it
is
too
but
death
advanced
they
had
waited
until
day
and
the
abbe
having
been
notified
was
about
to
come
everything
was
now
ready
to
receive
the
clergyman
the
huberts
had
just
finished
arranging
the
room
under
the
gay
sunlight
which
at
this
early
morning
hour
struck
fully
upon
the
it
looked
pure
as
the
dawn
in
the
nudity
of
its
great
white
walls
the
table
had
been
covered
with
a
fresh
damask
cloth
at
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
crucifix
two
large
were
burning
in
the
silver
candelabrum
which
had
been
brought
up
from
the
parlour
and
there
were
also
there
the
consecrated
wafers
the
asperges
brush
an
ewer
of
water
with
its
basin
and
a
napkin
and
two
plates
of
white
porcelain
one
of
which
was
filled
with
long
bits
of
cotton
and
the
other
with
little
of
paper
the
greenhouses
of
the
lower
town
had
been
thoroughly
searched
but
the
only
inodorous
flowers
that
had
been
found
were
the
peonies
great
white
peonies
enormous
tufts
of
which
adorned
the
table
like
a
shimmering
of
white
lace
and
in
the
midst
of
this
intense
whiteness
angelique
dying
with
closed
eyes
still
breathed
gently
with
a
breath
the
doctor
who
had
made
his
first
morning
visit
had
said
that
she
could
not
live
through
the
day
she
might
indeed
pass
away
at
any
moment
without
even
having
come
to
her
senses
at
all
the
huberts
resolute
and
grave
waited
in
silent
despair
notwithstanding
their
grief
and
tears
it
was
evidently
necessary
that
this
should
be
the
end
if
they
had
ever
wished
for
this
death
preferring
to
lose
their
dear
child
rather
than
to
have
her
rebellious
it
was
evident
that
god
also
wished
it
with
them
and
now
that
in
this
last
trying
moment
they
were
quite
powerless
they
could
only
submit
themselves
to
the
inevitable
they
regretted
nothing
although
their
sorrow
seemed
greater
than
they
could
bear
since
she
their
darling
had
been
there
suffering
from
her
long
illness
they
had
taken
the
entire
care
of
her
day
and
night
refusing
all
aid
offered
them
from
outside
they
were
still
there
alone
in
this
supreme
hour
and
they
waited
hubert
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
walked
mechanically
to
the
porcelain
stove
the
door
of
which
he
opened
for
the
gentle
roaring
of
the
flaming
wood
sounded
to
him
like
a
plaintive
moan
then
there
was
a
perfect
silence
the
peonies
seemed
even
to
turn
paler
in
the
soft
heat
of
the
room
hubertine
stronger
than
her
husband
and
still
fully
conscious
of
all
she
did
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
cathedral
as
they
came
to
her
from
behind
the
walls
during
the
past
moment
the
old
stones
had
vibrated
from
the
swinging
of
the
bell
of
the
great
tower
it
must
certainly
be
the
abbe
cornille
leaving
the
church
with
the
sacred
oils
she
thought
so
she
went
downstairs
that
she
might
receive
him
at
the
door
of
the
house
two
minutes
later
the
narrow
stairway
of
the
little
tower
was
filled
with
a
great
murmuring
sound
then
in
the
warm
chamber
hubert
struck
with
astonishment
suddenly
began
to
tremble
whilst
a
religious
fear
mingled
with
a
faint
hope
made
him
fall
upon
his
knees
instead
of
the
old
clergyman
whom
they
had
expected
it
was
monseigneur
who
entered
yes
monseigneur
in
lace
surplice
having
the
violet
stole
and
carrying
the
silver
vessel
in
which
was
the
oil
for
the
sick
which
he
himself
had
blessed
on
holy
thursday
his
eyes
were
fixed
as
he
looked
straight
before
him
his
beautiful
pale
face
was
really
majestic
under
the
thick
curly
masses
of
his
white
hair
behind
him
walked
the
abbe
cornille
like
a
simple
clerk
carrying
in
one
hand
a
crucifix
and
under
the
other
a
book
of
ritual
service
standing
for
a
moment
upon
the
threshold
the
bishop
said
in
a
deep
grave
voice
huic
peace
be
to
this
omnibus
habitantibus
in
replied
the
priest
in
a
lower
tone
and
to
all
the
inhabitants
when
they
had
entered
hubertine
who
had
come
up
the
stairs
after
them
she
also
trembling
from
surprise
and
emotion
went
and
knelt
by
the
side
of
her
husband
both
of
them
prostrated
themselves
most
humbly
and
prayed
fervently
from
the
depths
of
their
souls
a
few
hours
after
his
last
visit
to
angelique
felicien
had
had
the
terrible
and
dreaded
explanation
with
his
father
early
in
the
morning
of
that
same
day
he
had
found
open
the
doors
he
had
penetrated
even
into
the
oratory
where
the
bishop
was
still
at
prayer
after
one
of
those
nights
of
frightful
struggling
against
the
memories
of
the
past
which
would
so
constantly
reappear
before
him
in
the
soul
of
this
hitherto
always
respectful
son
until
now
kept
submissive
by
fear
rebellion
against
authority
so
long
a
time
stifled
suddenly
broke
forth
and
the
collision
of
these
two
men
of
the
same
blood
with
natures
equally
prompt
to
violence
was
intense
the
old
man
had
left
his
devotional
chair
and
with
cheeks
growing
purple
by
degrees
he
listened
silently
as
he
stood
there
in
his
proud
obstinacy
the
young
man
with
face
equally
inflamed
poured
out
everything
that
was
in
his
heart
speaking
in
a
voice
that
little
by
little
grew
louder
and
rebuking
he
said
that
angelique
was
not
only
ill
but
dying
he
told
him
that
in
a
pressing
moment
of
temptation
overcome
by
his
deep
affection
he
had
wished
to
take
her
away
with
him
that
they
might
flee
together
and
that
she
with
the
submissive
humility
of
a
saint
and
chaste
as
a
lily
had
refused
to
accompany
him
would
it
not
be
a
most
abominable
murder
to
allow
this
obedient
young
girl
to
die
because
she
had
been
unwilling
to
accept
him
unless
when
offered
to
her
by
the
hand
of
his
father
she
loved
him
so
sincerely
that
she
could
die
for
him
in
fact
she
could
have
had
him
with
his
name
and
his
fortune
but
she
had
said
no
and
triumphant
over
her
feelings
she
had
struggled
with
herself
in
order
to
do
her
duty
now
after
such
a
proof
of
her
goodness
could
he
permit
her
to
suffer
so
much
grief
like
her
he
would
be
willing
to
give
up
everything
to
die
even
if
it
might
be
and
he
realised
that
he
was
cowardly
he
despised
himself
for
not
being
at
her
side
that
they
might
pass
out
of
life
together
by
the
same
breath
was
it
possible
that
anyone
could
be
so
cruel
as
to
wish
to
torment
them
that
they
should
both
have
so
sad
a
death
when
one
word
one
simple
word
would
secure
them
such
bliss
ah
the
pride
of
name
the
glory
of
wealth
persistence
in
one
s
determination
all
these
were
nothing
in
comparison
to
the
fact
that
by
the
union
of
two
hearts
the
eternal
happiness
of
two
human
beings
was
assured
he
joined
his
hands
together
he
twisted
them
feverishly
quite
beside
himself
as
he
demanded
his
father
s
consent
still
supplicating
already
almost
threatening
but
the
bishop
with
face
deeply
flushed
by
the
mounting
of
his
blood
with
swollen
lips
with
flaming
eyes
terrible
in
his
unexpressed
anger
at
last
opened
his
mouth
only
to
reply
by
this
word
of
parental
authority
never
then
felicien
absolutely
raving
in
his
rebellion
lost
all
control
over
himself
he
spoke
of
his
mother
he
really
threatened
his
father
by
the
remembrance
of
the
dead
it
was
she
who
had
come
back
again
in
the
shape
of
her
son
to
vindicate
and
reclaim
the
right
of
affection
could
it
be
that
his
father
had
never
loved
her
had
he
even
rejoiced
in
her
death
since
he
showed
himself
so
harsh
towards
those
who
loved
each
other
and
who
wished
to
live
but
he
might
well
do
all
he
could
to
become
cold
in
the
renunciations
demanded
by
the
church
she
would
come
back
to
haunt
and
to
torture
him
because
he
was
willing
to
torture
the
child
they
had
had
the
living
witness
of
their
affection
for
each
other
she
would
always
be
there
so
long
as
their
son
lived
she
wished
to
reappear
in
the
children
of
their
child
for
ever
and
he
was
causing
her
to
die
over
again
by
refusing
to
her
son
the
betrothed
of
his
choice
the
one
through
whom
the
race
was
to
be
continued
when
a
man
had
once
been
married
to
a
woman
he
should
never
think
of
wedding
the
church
face
to
face
with
his
father
who
motionless
appeared
in
his
fearful
silence
to
grow
taller
and
taller
he
uttered
unfilial
almost
murderous
words
then
shocked
at
himself
he
rushed
away
shuddering
at
the
extent
to
which
passion
had
carried
him
when
once
more
alone
monseigneur
as
if
stabbed
in
the
full
breast
by
a
sharp
weapon
turned
back
upon
himself
and
struggled
deeply
with
his
soul
as
he
knelt
upon
his
a
sound
came
from
his
throat
oh
these
frightful
heart
contests
these
invincible
weaknesses
of
the
flesh
this
woman
and
his
beloved
dead
who
was
constantly
coming
back
to
life
he
adored
her
now
as
he
did
the
first
evening
when
he
kissed
her
white
feet
and
this
son
he
idolised
him
as
belonging
to
her
as
a
part
of
her
life
which
she
had
left
to
him
and
even
the
young
girl
the
little
working
girl
whom
he
had
repulsed
he
loved
her
also
with
a
tenderness
like
that
of
his
son
for
her
now
his
nights
were
inexpressibly
agitated
by
all
three
without
his
having
been
willing
to
acknowledge
it
had
she
then
touched
him
so
deeply
as
he
saw
her
in
the
great
cathedral
this
little
embroiderer
with
her
golden
hair
her
fresh
pure
neck
in
all
the
perfume
of
her
youth
he
saw
her
again
she
passed
before
him
so
delicate
so
pure
in
her
victorious
submission
no
remorse
could
have
come
to
him
with
a
step
more
certain
or
more
conquering
he
might
reject
her
with
a
loud
voice
he
knew
well
that
henceforth
she
held
him
strongly
by
the
heart
with
her
humble
hands
that
bore
the
signs
of
work
whilst
felicien
was
so
violently
beseeching
him
he
seemed
to
see
them
both
behind
the
blonde
head
of
the
petitioner
these
two
idolised
women
the
one
for
whom
his
son
prayed
and
the
one
who
had
died
for
her
child
they
were
there
in
all
their
physical
beauty
in
all
their
loving
devotion
and
he
could
not
tell
where
he
had
found
strength
to
resist
so
entirely
did
his
whole
being
go
out
towards
them
overcome
sobbing
not
knowing
how
he
could
again
become
calm
he
demanded
from
heaven
the
courage
to
tear
out
his
heart
since
this
heart
belonged
no
longer
to
god
alone
until
evening
monseigneur
continued
at
prayer
when
he
at
last
reappeared
he
was
white
as
wax
distressed
anxious
but
still
resolute
he
could
do
nothing
more
but
he
repeated
to
his
son
the
terrible
word
never
it
was
god
alone
who
had
the
right
to
relieve
him
from
his
promise
and
god
although
implored
gave
him
no
sign
of
change
it
was
necessary
to
suffer
some
days
had
passed
felicien
constantly
wandered
round
the
little
house
wild
with
grief
eager
for
news
each
time
that
he
saw
anyone
come
out
he
almost
fainted
from
fear
thus
it
happened
that
on
the
morning
when
hubertine
ran
to
the
church
to
ask
for
the
sacred
oils
he
learned
that
angelique
could
not
live
through
the
day
the
abbe
cornille
was
not
at
the
sacristy
and
he
rushed
about
the
town
to
find
him
still
having
a
last
hope
that
through
the
intervention
of
the
good
man
some
divine
aid
might
come
then
as
he
brought
back
with
him
the
clergyman
his
hope
left
him
and
he
had
a
frightful
attack
of
doubt
and
anger
what
should
he
do
in
what
way
could
he
force
heaven
to
come
to
his
assistance
he
went
away
hastened
to
the
bishop
s
palace
the
doors
of
which
he
again
forced
open
and
before
his
incoherent
words
his
father
was
for
a
moment
frightened
at
last
he
understood
angelique
was
dying
she
awaited
the
extreme
unction
and
now
god
alone
could
save
her
the
young
man
had
only
come
to
cry
out
all
his
agony
to
break
all
relations
with
this
cruel
unnatural
father
and
to
accuse
him
to
his
face
of
willingly
allowing
this
death
but
monseigneur
listened
to
him
without
anger
upright
and
very
serious
his
eyes
suddenly
brightened
with
a
strange
clearness
as
if
an
inner
voice
had
spoken
to
him
motioning
to
his
son
to
lead
the
way
he
followed
him
simply
saying
at
last
if
god
wishes
it
i
also
wish
felicien
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
move
his
father
consented
freed
from
his
personal
vow
to
submit
himself
to
the
goodwill
of
the
miracle
henceforth
they
as
individuals
counted
for
nothing
god
must
act
for
himself
tears
blinded
him
whilst
in
the
sacristy
monseigneur
took
the
sacred
oils
from
the
hands
of
the
abbe
cornille
he
accompanied
them
almost
staggering
he
did
not
dare
to
enter
into
the
chamber
but
fell
upon
his
knees
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
which
was
open
wide
the
voice
of
the
bishop
was
firm
as
he
said
huic
omnibus
habitantibus
in
the
priest
replied
monseigneur
had
just
placed
on
the
white
table
between
the
two
the
sacred
oils
making
in
the
air
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
the
silver
vase
then
he
took
from
the
hands
of
the
abbe
the
crucifix
and
approached
the
sufferer
that
he
might
make
her
kiss
it
but
angelique
was
still
unconscious
her
eyes
were
closed
her
mouth
shut
her
hands
rigid
and
looking
like
the
little
stiff
figures
of
stone
placed
upon
tombs
he
examined
her
for
a
moment
and
seeing
by
the
slight
movement
of
her
chest
that
she
was
not
dead
he
placed
upon
her
lips
the
crucifix
he
waited
his
face
preserved
the
majesty
of
a
minister
of
penitence
and
no
signs
of
emotion
were
visible
when
he
realised
that
not
even
a
quivering
had
passed
over
the
exquisite
profile
of
the
young
girl
nor
in
her
beautiful
hair
she
still
lived
however
and
that
was
sufficient
for
the
redemption
of
her
sins
the
abbe
then
gave
to
monseigneur
the
vessel
of
holy
water
and
the
asperges
brush
and
while
he
held
open
before
him
the
ritual
book
he
threw
the
holy
water
upon
the
dying
girl
as
he
read
the
latin
words
me
domine
hyssopo
et
mundabor
lavabis
me
et
super
nivem
thou
shalt
sprinkle
me
with
hyssop
and
i
shall
be
clean
thou
shalt
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
whiter
than
the
drops
sprang
forth
in
every
direction
and
the
whole
bed
was
refreshed
by
them
as
if
sprinkled
with
dew
it
rained
upon
her
hands
and
upon
her
cheeks
but
one
by
one
the
drops
rolled
away
as
if
from
insensible
marble
at
last
the
bishop
turned
towards
the
assistants
and
sprinkled
them
in
their
turn
hubert
and
hubertine
kneeling
side
by
side
in
the
full
union
of
their
perfect
faith
bent
humbly
under
the
shower
of
this
benediction
then
monseigneur
blessed
also
the
chamber
the
furniture
the
white
walls
in
all
their
bare
purity
and
as
he
passed
near
the
door
he
found
himself
before
his
son
who
had
fallen
down
on
the
threshold
and
was
sobbing
violently
having
covered
his
face
with
his
burning
hands
with
a
slow
movement
he
raised
three
times
the
asperges
brush
and
he
purified
him
with
a
gentle
rain
this
holy
water
spread
everywhere
was
intended
at
first
to
drive
away
all
evil
spirits
who
were
flying
by
crowds
although
invisible
just
at
this
moment
a
pale
ray
of
the
winter
sun
passed
over
the
bed
and
a
multitude
of
atoms
light
specks
of
dust
seemed
to
be
living
therein
they
were
innumerable
as
they
came
down
from
an
angle
of
the
window
as
if
to
bathe
with
their
warmth
the
cold
hands
of
the
dying
going
again
towards
the
table
monseigneur
repeated
the
prayer
give
ear
to
he
made
no
haste
it
was
true
that
death
was
there
hovering
near
the
old
faded
chintz
curtains
but
he
knew
that
it
was
patient
and
that
it
would
wait
and
although
in
her
state
of
utter
prostration
the
child
could
not
hear
him
he
addressed
her
as
he
asked
her
is
there
nothing
upon
your
conscience
which
distresses
you
confess
all
your
doubts
and
fears
my
daughter
relieve
your
she
was
still
in
the
same
position
and
she
was
always
silent
when
in
vain
he
had
given
time
for
a
reply
he
commenced
the
exhortation
with
the
same
full
voice
without
appearing
to
notice
that
none
of
his
words
reached
her
ear
collect
your
thoughts
meditate
demand
from
the
depths
of
your
soul
pardon
from
god
the
sacrament
will
purify
you
and
will
strengthen
you
anew
your
eyes
will
become
clear
your
ears
chaste
your
nostrils
fresh
your
mouth
pure
your
hands
with
eyes
fixed
upon
her
he
continued
reading
to
the
end
all
that
was
necessary
for
him
to
say
while
she
scarcely
breathed
nor
did
one
of
her
closed
eyelids
move
then
he
said
recite
the
and
having
waited
awhile
he
repeated
it
himself
in
unum
deum
patrem
i
believe
in
one
god
the
father
amen
replied
the
abbe
cornille
all
this
time
the
heavy
sobbing
of
felicien
was
heard
as
upon
the
he
wept
in
the
enervation
of
hope
hubert
and
hubertine
still
prayed
fervently
with
the
same
anxious
waiting
and
desire
as
if
they
had
felt
descend
upon
them
all
the
invisible
powers
of
the
unknown
a
change
now
came
in
the
service
from
the
murmur
of
prayers
then
the
litanies
of
the
ritual
were
unfolded
the
invocation
to
all
the
saints
the
flight
of
the
kyrie
eleison
calling
heaven
to
the
aid
of
miserable
humanity
mounting
each
time
with
great
outbursts
like
the
fume
of
incense
then
the
voices
suddenly
fell
and
there
was
a
deep
silence
monseigneur
washed
his
fingers
in
the
few
drops
of
water
that
the
abbe
poured
out
from
the
ewer
at
length
he
took
the
vessel
of
sacred
oil
opened
the
cover
thereof
and
placed
himself
before
the
bed
it
was
the
solemn
approach
of
the
sacrament
of
this
last
religious
ceremony
by
the
efficacy
of
which
are
effaced
all
mortal
or
venial
sins
not
pardoned
which
rest
in
the
soul
after
having
received
the
other
sacraments
old
remains
of
forgotten
sins
sins
committed
unwittingly
sins
of
languor
which
prevented
one
from
being
firmly
in
the
grace
of
god
the
pure
white
chamber
seemed
to
be
like
the
individuals
collected
therein
motionless
and
in
a
state
of
surprise
and
expectation
where
could
all
these
sins
be
found
they
must
certainly
come
from
outside
in
this
great
band
of
sun
s
rays
filled
with
dancing
specks
of
dust
which
appeared
to
bring
germs
of
life
even
to
this
great
royal
couch
so
white
and
cold
from
the
coming
of
death
to
a
pure
young
maiden
monseigneur
meditated
a
moment
fixing
his
looks
again
upon
angelique
assuring
himself
that
the
slight
breath
had
not
ceased
struggling
against
all
human
emotion
as
he
saw
how
thin
she
was
with
the
beauty
of
an
archangel
already
immaterial
his
voice
retained
the
authority
of
a
divine
disinterestedness
and
his
thumb
did
not
tremble
when
he
dipped
it
into
the
sacred
oils
as
he
commenced
the
unctions
on
the
five
parts
of
the
body
where
dwell
the
senses
the
five
windows
by
which
evil
enters
into
the
soul
first
upon
the
eyes
upon
the
closed
eyelids
the
right
and
then
the
left
and
slowly
lightly
he
traced
with
his
thumb
the
sign
of
the
cross
istam
sanctam
unctionem
et
suam
piissimam
misericordiam
indulgeat
tibi
dominus
quidquid
per
visum
by
this
holy
anointing
and
his
gracious
mercy
the
lord
forgive
whatever
sins
thou
hast
committed
through
this
formula
is
repeated
with
reference
to
the
other
senses
hearing
smell
taste
and
touch
and
the
sins
of
the
sight
were
redeemed
lascivious
looks
immodest
curiosity
the
pride
of
spectacles
unwholesome
readings
tears
shed
for
guilty
troubles
and
she
dear
child
knew
no
other
book
than
the
golden
legend
no
other
horizon
than
the
apse
of
the
cathedral
which
hid
from
view
all
the
rest
of
the
world
she
had
wept
only
in
the
struggle
of
obedience
and
the
renunciation
of
passion
the
abbe
cornille
wiped
both
her
eyes
with
a
bit
of
cotton
which
he
afterwards
put
into
one
of
the
little
cornets
of
paper
then
monseigneur
anointed
the
ears
with
their
lobes
as
delicate
and
transparent
as
pearl
first
the
right
ear
afterwards
the
left
scarcely
moistened
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
istam
sanctam
unctionem
et
suam
piissimam
misericordiam
indulgeat
tibi
dominus
quidquid
per
auditum
so
all
the
abominations
of
hearing
were
atoned
for
all
the
words
and
music
which
corrupt
the
slanders
the
calumnies
the
blasphemies
the
sinful
propositions
listened
to
with
complacency
the
falsehoods
of
love
which
aided
the
forgetfulness
of
duty
the
profane
songs
which
excited
the
senses
the
violins
of
the
orchestra
which
as
it
were
wept
voluptuously
under
the
brilliant
lights
she
in
her
isolated
life
like
that
of
a
cloistered
nun
she
had
never
even
heard
the
free
gossip
of
the
neighbours
or
the
oath
of
a
carman
as
he
whips
his
horses
the
only
music
that
had
ever
entered
her
ears
was
that
of
the
sacred
hymns
the
rumblings
of
the
organs
the
confused
murmurings
of
prayers
with
which
at
times
vibrated
all
this
fresh
little
house
so
close
to
the
side
of
the
great
church
the
abbe
after
having
dried
the
ears
with
cotton
put
that
bit
also
into
one
of
the
white
cornets
monseigneur
now
passed
to
the
nostrils
the
right
and
then
the
left
like
two
petals
of
a
white
rose
which
he
purified
by
touching
them
with
the
sacred
oil
and
making
on
them
the
sign
of
the
cross
istam
sanctam
unctionem
et
suam
piissimam
misericordiam
indulgeat
tibi
dominus
quidquid
per
odoratum
and
the
sense
of
smell
returned
to
its
primitive
innocence
cleansed
from
all
stain
not
only
from
the
carnal
disgrace
of
perfumes
from
the
seduction
of
flowers
with
breath
too
sweet
from
the
scattered
fragrances
of
the
air
which
put
the
soul
to
sleep
but
yet
again
from
the
faults
of
the
interior
sense
the
bad
examples
given
to
others
and
the
contagious
pestilence
of
scandal
erect
and
pure
she
had
at
last
become
a
lily
among
the
lilies
a
great
lily
whose
perfume
fortified
the
weak
and
delighted
the
strong
in
fact
she
was
so
truly
delicate
that
she
could
never
endure
the
powerful
odour
of
carnations
the
musk
of
lilacs
the
feverish
sweetness
of
hyacinths
and
was
only
at
ease
with
the
scentless
blossoms
like
the
marguerites
and
the
periwinkles
once
more
the
abbe
with
the
cotton
dried
the
anointed
parts
and
slipped
the
little
tuft
into
another
of
the
cornets
then
monseigneur
descending
to
the
closed
mouth
through
which
the
faint
breath
was
now
scarcely
perceptible
made
upon
the
lower
lip
the
sign
of
the
cross
istam
sanctam
unctionem
et
suam
piissimam
misericordiam
indulgeat
tibi
dominus
quidquid
per
gustum
this
time
it
was
the
pardon
for
the
base
gratifications
of
taste
greediness
too
great
a
desire
for
wine
or
for
sweets
but
especially
the
forgiveness
for
sins
of
the
tongue
that
universally
guilty
member
the
provoker
the
poisoner
the
inventor
of
quarrels
the
inciter
to
wars
which
makes
one
utter
words
of
error
and
falsehood
which
at
length
obscure
even
the
heavens
yet
her
whole
mouth
was
only
a
chalice
of
innocence
she
had
never
had
the
vice
of
gluttony
for
she
had
taught
herself
like
elizabeth
to
eat
whatever
was
set
before
her
without
paying
great
attention
to
her
food
and
if
it
were
true
that
she
lived
in
error
it
was
the
fault
of
her
dream
which
had
placed
her
there
the
hope
of
a
beyond
the
consolation
of
what
was
invisible
and
all
the
world
of
enchantment
which
her
ignorance
had
created
and
which
had
made
of
her
a
saint
the
abbe
having
dried
the
lips
folded
the
bit
of
cotton
in
the
fourth
white
cornet
at
last
monseigneur
anointed
first
the
right
and
then
the
left
palms
of
the
two
little
hands
lying
open
upon
the
sheet
and
cleansed
them
from
their
sins
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
istam
sanctam
unctionem
et
suam
piissimam
misericordiam
indulgeat
tibi
dominus
quidquid
per
tactum
and
the
whole
body
was
purified
being
washed
from
its
last
spots
those
of
the
touch
the
most
repugnant
of
all
pilfering
fighting
murder
without
counting
other
sins
of
the
breast
the
body
and
the
feet
which
were
also
redeemed
by
this
unction
all
which
burns
in
the
flesh
our
anger
our
desires
our
unruled
passions
the
snares
and
pitfalls
into
which
we
run
and
all
forbidden
joys
by
which
we
are
tempted
since
she
had
been
there
dying
from
her
victory
over
herself
she
had
conquered
her
few
failings
her
pride
and
her
passion
as
if
she
had
inherited
original
sin
simply
for
the
glory
of
triumphing
over
it
she
knew
not
even
that
she
had
had
other
wishes
that
love
had
drawn
her
towards
disobedience
so
armed
was
she
with
the
breastplate
of
ignorance
of
evil
so
pure
and
white
was
her
soul
the
abbe
wiped
the
little
motionless
hands
and
putting
the
last
puff
of
cotton
in
the
remaining
cornet
he
threw
the
five
papers
into
the
fire
at
the
back
of
the
stove
the
ceremony
was
finished
monseigneur
washed
his
fingers
before
saying
the
final
prayer
he
had
now
only
to
again
exhort
the
dying
in
placing
in
her
hand
the
symbolic
taper
to
drive
away
the
demons
and
to
show
that
she
had
just
recovered
her
baptismal
innocence
but
she
remained
rigid
her
eyes
closed
her
mouth
shut
as
if
dead
the
holy
oils
had
purified
her
body
the
signs
of
the
cross
had
left
their
traces
on
the
five
windows
of
the
soul
without
making
the
slightest
wave
of
colour
or
of
life
mount
to
her
cheeks
although
implored
and
hoped
for
the
prodigy
did
not
appear
and
the
room
was
silent
and
anxious
hubert
and
hubertine
still
kneeling
side
by
side
no
longer
prayed
but
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
their
darling
gazed
so
earnestly
that
they
both
seemed
motionless
for
ever
like
the
figures
of
the
who
await
the
resurrection
in
a
corner
of
an
old
painted
glass
window
felicien
had
drawn
himself
up
on
his
knees
and
was
now
at
the
door
having
ceased
from
sobbing
as
with
head
erect
he
also
might
see
if
god
would
always
remain
deaf
to
their
prayers
was
it
then
a
mere
lure
would
not
this
holy
sacrament
bring
her
back
to
life
for
the
last
time
monseigneur
approached
the
bed
followed
by
the
abbe
cornille
who
held
already
lighted
the
which
was
to
be
placed
in
the
hand
of
the
young
girl
and
the
bishop
not
willing
to
acknowledge
the
state
of
unconsciousness
in
which
she
remained
determining
to
go
even
to
the
end
of
the
rite
that
god
might
have
time
in
which
to
work
pronounced
the
formula
lampadem
ardentem
custodi
unctionem
tuam
ut
cum
dominus
ad
judicandum
venerit
possis
occurrere
ei
cum
omnibus
sanctis
et
vivas
in
saecula
receive
this
light
and
keep
the
unction
thou
hast
received
that
when
the
lord
shall
come
to
judgment
thou
mayest
meet
him
with
all
his
saints
and
live
with
him
for
ever
and
amen
replied
the
abbe
but
when
they
endeavoured
to
open
angelique
s
hand
and
to
press
it
round
the
taper
the
hand
powerless
as
if
already
dead
escaped
them
and
fell
back
upon
her
breast
then
little
by
little
monseigneur
yielded
to
a
great
nervous
trembling
it
was
the
emotion
which
for
a
long
time
restrained
now
broke
out
within
him
carrying
away
with
it
the
last
rigidity
of
priesthood
he
dearly
loved
her
this
child
from
the
day
when
she
had
come
to
sob
at
his
feet
so
innocent
and
showing
so
plainly
the
pure
freshness
of
her
youth
since
then
in
his
nights
of
distress
he
had
contended
chiefly
against
her
to
defend
himself
from
the
overwhelming
tenderness
with
which
she
inspired
him
at
this
moment
she
was
worthy
of
pity
with
this
pallor
of
death
with
an
ethereal
beauty
which
showed
however
so
deep
a
suffering
that
he
could
not
look
at
her
without
his
heart
being
secretly
overwhelmed
with
distress
he
could
no
longer
control
himself
his
eyelids
were
swollen
by
the
great
tears
which
at
last
rolled
down
his
cheeks
she
must
not
die
in
this
way
he
was
conquered
by
her
touching
charms
even
in
death
and
all
his
paternal
feelings
went
out
towards
her
then
monseigneur
recalling
to
mind
the
numerous
miracles
of
his
race
the
power
which
had
been
given
them
by
heaven
to
heal
thought
that
doubtless
god
awaited
his
consent
as
a
father
he
invoked
saint
agnes
before
whom
all
his
ancestors
had
offered
up
their
devotions
and
as
jean
v
d
hautecoeur
prayed
at
the
bedside
of
those
smitten
by
the
plague
and
kissed
them
so
now
he
prayed
and
kissed
angelique
upon
her
lips
if
god
wishes
i
also
wish
immediately
angelique
opened
her
eyelids
she
looked
at
the
bishop
without
surprise
as
she
awoke
from
her
long
trance
and
her
lips
still
warm
from
the
kiss
smiled
upon
him
these
things
were
not
strange
to
her
for
they
certainly
must
have
been
realised
sooner
or
later
and
it
might
be
that
she
was
coming
out
of
one
dream
only
to
have
another
still
but
it
seemed
to
her
perfectly
natural
that
monseigneur
should
have
come
to
betroth
her
to
felicien
since
the
hour
for
that
ceremony
had
arrived
in
a
few
minutes
unaided
she
sat
up
in
the
middle
of
her
great
royal
bed
the
bishop
radiant
showing
by
his
expression
his
clear
appreciation
of
the
remarkable
prodigy
repeated
the
formula
lampadem
ardentem
custodi
unctionem
tuam
ut
cum
dominus
ad
judicandum
venerit
possis
occurrere
ei
cum
omnibus
sanctis
et
vivas
in
saecula
amen
replied
the
abbe
angelique
had
taken
the
lighted
taper
and
held
it
up
with
a
firm
hand
life
had
come
back
to
her
like
the
flame
of
the
candle
which
was
burning
clear
and
bright
driving
away
the
spirits
of
the
night
a
great
cry
resounded
through
the
room
felicien
was
standing
up
as
if
raised
by
the
power
of
the
miracle
while
the
huberts
overwhelmed
by
the
same
feeling
remained
upon
their
knees
with
eyes
with
delighted
countenances
before
that
which
they
had
seen
the
bed
had
appeared
to
them
enveloped
with
a
brilliant
light
white
masses
seemed
still
to
be
mounting
up
on
the
rays
of
the
sunlight
and
the
great
walls
the
whole
room
in
fact
kept
a
white
lustre
as
that
of
snow
in
the
midst
of
all
angelique
like
a
refreshed
lily
replaced
upon
its
branch
appeared
in
the
clear
light
her
fine
golden
hair
was
like
a
halo
of
glory
around
her
head
her
eyes
shone
divinely
and
her
pure
face
beamed
with
a
living
splendour
felicien
seeing
that
she
was
saved
touched
by
the
divine
grace
that
heaven
had
vouchsafed
them
approached
her
and
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
bed
ah
dear
soul
you
recognise
us
now
and
you
will
live
i
am
yours
my
father
wishes
it
to
be
so
since
god
has
desired
she
bowed
her
head
smiling
sweetly
as
she
said
oh
i
knew
it
must
be
so
and
waited
for
it
all
that
i
have
foreseen
will
come
to
monseigneur
who
had
regained
his
usual
proud
serenity
placed
the
crucifix
once
more
on
her
lips
and
this
time
she
kissed
it
as
a
submissive
servant
then
with
a
full
movement
of
his
hands
through
the
room
above
the
heads
of
all
present
the
bishop
gave
the
final
benediction
while
the
huberts
and
the
abbe
cornille
wept
felicien
had
taken
one
of
the
little
hands
of
angelique
while
in
the
other
little
hand
the
taper
of
innocence
burned
bright
and
clear
chapter
xvii
the
marriage
was
fixed
for
the
early
part
of
march
but
angelique
remained
very
feeble
notwithstanding
the
joy
which
radiated
from
her
whole
person
she
had
wished
after
the
first
week
of
her
convalescence
to
go
down
to
the
workroom
persisting
in
her
determination
to
finish
the
panel
of
embroidery
in
which
was
to
be
used
for
the
bishop
s
chair
it
would
be
she
said
cheerfully
her
last
best
piece
of
work
and
besides
no
one
ever
leaves
she
added
an
order
only
then
exhausted
by
the
effort
she
was
again
forced
to
keep
her
chamber
she
lived
there
happy
and
smiling
without
regaining
the
full
health
of
former
times
always
white
and
immaterial
as
the
sacred
sacramental
oils
going
and
coming
with
a
gentle
step
like
that
of
a
vision
and
after
having
occasionally
made
the
exertion
of
walking
as
far
as
from
her
table
to
the
window
finding
herself
obliged
to
rest
quietly
for
hours
and
give
herself
up
to
her
sweet
thoughts
at
length
they
deferred
the
thinking
it
better
to
wait
for
her
complete
recovery
which
must
certainly
come
if
she
were
well
nursed
and
cared
for
every
afternoon
felicien
went
up
to
see
her
hubert
and
hubertine
were
there
and
they
passed
together
most
delightful
hours
during
which
they
continually
made
and
the
same
bright
projects
seated
in
her
great
chair
she
laughed
gaily
seemed
trembling
with
life
and
vivacity
as
she
was
the
first
to
talk
of
the
days
which
would
be
so
well
filled
when
together
they
could
take
long
journeys
and
of
all
the
unknown
joys
that
would
come
to
them
after
they
had
restored
the
old
chateau
d
hautecoeur
anyone
to
have
seen
her
then
would
have
considered
her
saved
and
regaining
her
strength
in
the
backward
spring
the
air
of
which
growing
warmer
and
warmer
daily
entered
by
the
open
window
in
fact
she
never
fell
back
into
the
deep
gravities
of
her
dreams
except
when
she
was
entirely
alone
and
was
not
afraid
of
being
seen
in
the
night
voices
still
appeared
to
be
near
her
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
were
calling
to
her
and
at
last
the
truth
was
clearly
revealed
to
her
so
that
she
fully
understood
that
the
miracle
was
being
continued
only
for
the
realisation
of
her
dream
was
she
not
already
dead
having
simply
the
appearance
of
living
thanks
to
the
respite
which
had
been
granted
her
from
divine
grace
this
idea
soothed
her
with
deep
gentleness
in
her
hours
of
solitude
and
she
did
not
feel
a
moment
s
regret
at
the
thought
of
being
called
away
from
life
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
so
certain
was
she
of
always
realising
to
its
fullest
extent
her
anticipated
joy
the
cheerfulness
she
had
hitherto
shown
became
simply
a
little
more
serious
she
abandoned
herself
to
it
quietly
forgetting
her
physical
weakness
as
she
indulged
in
the
pure
delights
of
fancy
it
was
only
when
she
heard
the
huberts
open
the
door
or
when
felicien
came
to
see
her
that
she
was
able
to
sit
upright
to
bring
her
thoughts
back
to
her
surroundings
and
to
appear
as
if
she
were
regaining
her
health
laughing
pleasantly
while
she
talked
of
their
years
of
happy
housekeeping
far
away
in
the
days
to
come
towards
the
end
of
march
angelique
grew
very
restless
and
much
weaker
twice
when
by
herself
she
had
long
fainting
fits
one
morning
she
fell
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
just
as
hubert
was
bringing
her
up
a
cup
of
milk
by
a
great
effort
of
will
she
conquered
herself
and
that
she
might
deceive
him
she
remained
on
the
floor
and
smiled
as
she
pretended
to
be
looking
for
a
needle
that
had
been
dropped
the
following
day
she
was
gayer
than
usual
and
proposed
hastening
the
marriage
suggesting
that
at
all
events
it
should
not
be
put
off
any
later
than
the
middle
of
april
all
the
others
exclaimed
at
this
idea
asking
if
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
wait
awhile
since
she
was
still
so
delicate
there
was
no
need
of
being
in
such
a
hurry
she
however
seemed
feverishly
nervous
and
insisted
that
the
ceremony
should
take
place
immediately
yes
as
soon
as
possible
hubertine
surprised
at
the
request
having
a
suspicion
as
to
the
true
motive
of
this
eagerness
looked
at
her
earnestly
for
a
moment
and
turned
very
pale
as
she
realised
how
slight
was
the
cold
breath
which
still
attached
her
daughter
to
life
the
dear
invalid
had
already
grown
calm
in
her
tender
need
of
consoling
others
and
keeping
them
under
an
illusion
although
she
knew
personally
that
her
case
was
hopeless
hubert
and
felicien
in
continual
adoration
before
their
idol
had
neither
seen
nor
felt
anything
unusual
then
angelique
exerting
herself
almost
supernaturally
rose
up
and
was
more
charming
than
ever
as
she
slowly
moved
back
and
forth
with
the
light
step
of
former
days
she
continued
to
speak
of
her
wish
saying
if
it
were
granted
she
would
be
so
happy
and
that
after
the
wedding
she
would
certainly
be
cured
moreover
the
question
should
be
left
to
monseigneur
he
alone
should
decide
it
that
same
evening
when
the
bishop
was
there
she
explained
her
desire
to
him
fixing
her
eyes
on
his
regarding
him
steadily
and
beseechingly
and
speaking
in
her
sweet
earnest
voice
under
which
there
was
hidden
an
ardent
supplication
unexpressed
in
words
monseigneur
realised
it
and
understood
the
truth
and
he
appointed
a
day
in
the
middle
of
april
for
the
ceremony
then
they
lived
in
great
commotion
from
the
necessary
bustle
attendant
upon
the
preparations
for
the
marriage
notwithstanding
his
official
position
as
guardian
hubert
was
obliged
to
ask
permission
or
rather
the
consent
of
the
director
of
public
assistance
who
always
represented
the
family
council
angelique
not
yet
being
of
age
and
monsieur
grandsire
the
justice
of
the
peace
was
charged
with
all
legal
details
in
order
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
the
painful
side
of
the
position
to
the
young
girl
and
to
felicien
but
the
dear
child
realising
that
something
was
being
kept
back
asked
one
day
to
have
her
little
book
brought
up
to
her
wishing
to
put
it
herself
into
the
hands
of
her
betrothed
she
was
now
and
would
henceforth
remain
in
a
state
of
such
sincere
humility
that
she
wished
him
to
know
thoroughly
from
what
a
low
position
he
had
drawn
her
to
elevate
her
to
the
glory
of
his
name
and
his
great
fortune
these
were
her
parchments
her
titles
to
nobility
her
position
was
explained
by
this
official
document
this
entry
on
the
calendar
where
there
was
only
a
date
followed
by
a
number
she
turned
over
all
the
leaves
once
more
then
gave
it
to
him
without
being
confused
happy
in
thinking
that
in
herself
she
was
nothing
but
that
she
owed
everything
to
him
so
deeply
touched
was
he
by
this
act
that
he
knelt
down
kissed
her
hands
while
tears
came
to
his
eyes
as
if
it
were
she
who
had
made
him
the
one
gift
the
royal
gift
of
her
heart
for
two
weeks
the
preparations
occupied
all
beaumont
both
the
upper
and
the
lower
town
being
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
therefrom
it
was
said
that
twenty
were
engaged
day
and
night
upon
the
trousseau
the
alone
required
three
persons
to
make
it
and
there
was
to
be
a
or
present
from
the
bridegroom
to
the
value
of
a
million
of
francs
a
fluttering
of
laces
of
velvets
of
silks
and
satins
a
flood
of
precious
stones
diamonds
worthy
a
queen
but
that
which
excited
the
people
more
than
all
else
was
the
great
amount
given
in
charity
the
bride
having
wished
to
distribute
to
the
poor
as
much
as
she
had
received
herself
so
another
million
was
showered
down
upon
the
country
in
a
rain
of
gold
at
length
she
was
able
to
gratify
all
her
old
longings
of
benevolence
all
the
prodigalities
of
her
most
exaggerated
dreams
as
with
open
hands
she
let
fall
upon
the
wretched
and
needy
a
stream
of
riches
an
overflow
of
comforts
in
her
little
white
bare
chamber
confined
to
her
old
armchair
she
laughed
with
delight
when
the
abbe
cornille
brought
to
her
the
list
of
the
distributions
he
had
made
give
more
give
more
she
cried
as
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
not
enough
were
done
she
would
in
reality
have
liked
to
have
seen
the
pere
mascart
seated
for
ever
at
a
table
before
a
princely
banquet
the
chouteaux
living
in
palatial
luxury
the
gabet
cured
of
her
rheumatism
and
by
the
aid
of
money
to
have
renewed
her
youth
as
for
the
lemballeuse
the
mother
and
daughters
she
absolutely
wished
to
load
them
with
silk
dresses
and
jewellery
the
hail
of
golden
pieces
redoubled
over
the
town
as
in
far
beyond
the
daily
necessities
as
if
merely
for
the
beauty
and
joy
of
seeing
the
triumphal
golden
glory
thrown
from
full
hands
falling
into
the
street
and
glittering
in
the
great
sunlight
of
charity
at
last
on
the
eve
of
the
happy
day
everything
was
in
readiness
felicien
had
bought
a
large
house
on
the
rue
magloire
at
the
back
of
the
bishop
s
palace
which
had
been
fitted
up
and
furnished
most
luxuriously
there
were
great
rooms
hung
with
admirable
tapestries
filled
with
the
most
beautiful
articles
imaginable
a
salon
in
old
rare
pieces
of
hand
embroidery
a
boudoir
in
blue
soft
as
the
early
morning
sky
and
a
which
was
particularly
attractive
a
perfect
little
corner
of
white
silk
and
lace
nothing
in
short
but
white
airy
and
light
an
exquisite
shimmering
of
purity
but
angelique
had
constantly
refused
to
go
to
see
all
these
wonderful
things
although
a
carriage
was
always
ready
to
convey
her
there
she
listened
to
the
recital
of
that
which
had
been
done
with
an
enchanted
smile
but
she
gave
no
orders
and
did
not
appear
to
wish
to
occupy
herself
with
any
of
the
arrangements
no
no
she
said
for
all
these
things
seemed
so
far
away
in
the
unknown
of
that
vast
world
of
which
she
was
as
yet
totally
ignorant
since
those
who
loved
her
had
prepared
for
her
so
tenderly
this
happiness
she
desired
to
partake
thereof
and
to
enter
therein
like
a
princess
coming
from
some
chimerical
country
who
approaches
the
real
kingdom
where
she
is
to
reign
for
ever
in
the
same
way
she
preferred
to
know
nothing
except
by
hearsay
of
the
which
also
was
waiting
for
her
a
superb
gift
from
her
betrothed
the
wedding
outfit
of
fine
linen
embroidered
with
her
cipher
as
marchioness
the
costumes
tastefully
trimmed
the
old
family
jewels
valuable
as
the
richest
treasures
of
a
cathedral
and
the
modern
jewels
in
their
marvellous
yet
delicate
mountings
precious
stones
of
every
kind
and
diamonds
of
the
purest
water
it
was
sufficient
to
her
that
her
dream
had
come
to
pass
and
that
this
good
future
awaited
her
in
her
new
home
radiant
in
the
reality
of
the
new
life
that
was
opening
before
her
the
only
thing
she
saw
was
her
which
was
brought
to
her
on
the
marriage
morning
that
day
when
she
awoke
angelique
still
alone
had
in
her
great
bed
a
moment
of
intense
exhaustion
and
feared
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
get
up
at
all
she
attempted
to
do
so
but
her
knees
bent
under
her
and
in
contrast
to
the
brave
serenity
she
had
shown
for
weeks
past
a
fearful
anguish
the
last
perhaps
took
utter
possession
of
her
then
as
in
a
few
minutes
hubertine
came
into
the
room
looking
unusually
happy
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
could
really
walk
for
she
certainly
did
not
do
so
from
her
own
strength
but
aid
came
to
her
from
the
invisible
and
friendly
hands
sustained
and
carried
her
they
dressed
her
she
no
longer
seemed
to
weigh
anything
but
was
so
slight
and
frail
that
her
mother
was
astonished
and
laughingly
begged
her
not
to
move
any
more
if
she
did
not
wish
to
fly
quite
away
during
all
the
time
of
preparing
her
toilette
the
little
fresh
house
of
the
huberts
so
close
to
the
side
of
the
cathedral
trembled
under
the
great
breath
of
the
giant
of
that
which
already
was
humming
therein
of
the
preparations
for
the
ceremony
the
nervous
activity
of
the
clergy
and
especially
the
ringing
of
the
bells
a
continuous
peal
of
joy
with
which
the
old
stones
were
vibrating
in
the
upper
town
for
over
an
hour
there
had
been
a
glorious
chiming
of
bells
as
on
the
greatest
holy
days
the
sun
had
risen
in
all
its
beauty
and
on
this
limpid
april
morning
a
flood
of
spring
rays
seemed
living
with
the
sonorous
peals
which
had
called
together
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
the
whole
of
beaumont
was
in
a
state
of
rejoicing
on
account
of
the
marriage
of
this
little
embroiderer
to
whom
their
hearts
were
so
deeply
attached
and
they
were
touched
by
the
fact
of
her
royal
good
fortune
this
bright
sunlight
which
penetrated
all
the
streets
was
like
the
golden
rain
the
gifts
of
rolling
out
from
her
delicate
hands
under
this
joyful
light
the
multitude
crowded
in
masses
towards
the
cathedral
filling
the
of
the
church
and
coming
out
on
to
the
place
du
cloitre
there
the
great
front
of
the
building
rose
up
like
a
huge
bouquet
of
stone
in
full
blossom
of
the
most
ornamental
gothic
above
the
severe
romanesque
of
the
foundation
in
the
tower
the
bells
still
rung
and
the
whole
facade
seemed
to
be
like
a
glorification
of
these
nuptials
expressive
of
the
flight
of
this
poor
girl
through
all
the
wonders
of
the
miracle
as
it
darted
up
and
flamed
with
its
open
ornamentations
the
efflorescence
of
its
little
columns
its
balustrades
and
its
arches
the
niches
of
saints
surmounted
with
canopies
the
gable
ends
hollowed
out
in
trefoil
points
adorned
with
crossettes
and
flowers
immense
opening
out
in
the
mystic
radiation
of
their
mullions
at
ten
o
clock
the
organs
pealed
angelique
and
felicien
were
there
walking
with
slow
steps
towards
the
high
altar
between
the
ranks
of
the
crowd
a
breath
of
sincere
touching
admiration
came
from
every
side
he
deeply
moved
passed
along
proud
and
serious
with
his
blonde
beauty
of
a
young
god
appearing
slighter
than
ever
from
his
black
but
she
above
all
struck
the
hearts
of
the
spectators
so
exquisite
was
she
so
divinely
beautiful
with
a
mystic
spiritual
charm
her
dress
was
of
white
watered
silk
simply
covered
with
rare
old
mechlin
lace
which
was
held
by
pearls
a
whole
setting
of
them
designing
the
ruches
of
the
waist
and
the
ruffles
of
the
skirt
a
veil
of
old
english
point
was
fastened
to
her
head
by
a
triple
crown
of
pearls
and
falling
to
her
feet
quite
covered
her
that
was
all
not
a
flower
not
a
jewel
nothing
but
this
slight
vision
this
delicate
trembling
cloud
which
seemed
to
have
placed
her
sweet
little
face
between
two
white
wings
like
that
of
the
virgin
of
the
painted
glass
window
with
her
violet
eyes
and
her
golden
hair
two
armchairs
covered
with
crimson
velvet
had
been
placed
for
felicien
and
angelique
before
the
altar
and
directly
behind
them
while
the
organs
increased
their
phrases
of
welcome
hubert
and
hubertine
knelt
on
the
low
benches
which
were
destined
for
the
family
the
day
before
an
intense
joy
had
come
to
them
from
the
effects
of
which
they
had
not
yet
recovered
and
they
were
incapable
of
expressing
their
deep
heartfelt
thanks
for
their
own
happiness
which
was
so
closely
connected
with
that
of
their
daughter
hubertine
having
gone
once
more
to
the
cemetery
saddened
by
the
thought
of
their
loneliness
and
the
little
house
which
would
seem
so
empty
after
the
departure
of
the
child
had
prayed
to
her
mother
for
a
long
time
when
suddenly
she
felt
within
her
an
inexplicable
relief
and
gladness
which
convinced
her
that
at
last
her
petition
had
been
granted
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
after
more
than
twenty
years
the
obstinate
mother
had
forgiven
them
and
sent
them
the
child
of
pardon
so
ardently
desired
and
longed
for
was
this
the
recompense
of
their
charity
towards
the
poor
forlorn
little
creature
whom
they
had
found
one
snowy
day
at
the
cathedral
entrance
and
who
was
to
wed
a
prince
with
all
the
show
and
pomp
of
the
greatest
ceremony
they
remained
on
their
knees
without
praying
in
formulated
words
enraptured
with
gratitude
their
whole
souls
overflowing
with
an
excess
of
infinite
thanksgiving
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
nave
seated
on
his
high
official
throne
monseigneur
was
also
one
of
the
family
group
he
seemed
filled
with
the
majesty
of
the
god
whom
he
represented
he
was
resplendent
in
the
glory
of
his
sacred
vestments
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
that
of
a
proud
serenity
as
if
he
were
entirely
freed
from
all
worldly
passions
above
his
head
on
the
panel
of
wonderful
embroidery
were
two
angels
supporting
the
brilliant
coat
of
arms
of
hautecoeur
then
the
solemn
service
began
all
the
clergy
connected
with
the
cathedral
were
present
to
do
honour
to
their
bishop
and
priests
had
come
from
the
different
parishes
to
assist
them
among
the
crowd
of
white
surplices
which
seemed
to
overflow
the
grating
shone
the
golden
capes
of
the
choristers
and
the
red
robes
of
the
the
almost
eternal
night
of
the
crushed
down
by
the
weight
of
the
heavy
romanesque
chapels
was
this
morning
slightly
brightened
by
the
limpid
april
sunlight
which
struck
the
painted
glass
of
the
windows
so
that
they
seemed
to
be
a
burning
of
gems
a
sacred
bursting
into
blossom
of
luminous
flowers
but
the
background
of
the
nave
particularly
blazed
with
a
swarming
of
tapers
as
innumerable
as
the
stars
of
evening
in
a
summer
sky
in
the
centre
the
high
altar
seemed
on
fire
from
them
a
true
burning
bush
symbolic
of
the
flame
that
consumes
souls
and
there
were
also
candles
in
large
candelabra
and
in
chandeliers
while
before
the
plighted
couple
two
enormous
lustres
with
round
branches
looked
like
two
suns
about
them
was
a
garden
of
masses
of
green
plants
and
of
living
blossoms
where
were
in
flower
great
tufts
of
white
azaleas
of
white
camellias
and
of
lilacs
away
to
the
back
of
the
apse
sparkled
bits
of
gold
and
silver
skirts
of
velvet
and
of
silk
a
distant
dazzling
of
the
tabernacle
among
the
sombre
surroundings
of
green
verdure
above
all
this
burning
the
nave
sprang
out
and
the
four
enormous
pillars
of
the
transept
mounted
upward
to
support
the
arched
vaulting
in
the
trembling
movement
of
these
myriads
of
little
flames
which
almost
seemed
to
pale
at
times
in
the
full
daylight
which
entered
by
the
high
gothic
windows
angelique
had
wished
to
be
married
by
the
good
abbe
cornille
and
when
she
saw
him
come
forward
in
his
surplice
and
with
the
white
stole
followed
by
two
clerks
she
smiled
this
was
at
last
the
triumphant
realisation
of
her
dream
she
was
wedding
fortune
beauty
and
power
far
beyond
her
wildest
hopes
the
church
itself
was
singing
by
the
organs
radiant
with
its
and
alive
with
the
crowd
of
believers
and
priests
whom
she
knew
to
be
around
her
on
every
side
never
had
the
old
building
been
more
brilliant
or
filled
with
a
more
regal
pomp
enlarged
as
it
were
in
its
holy
sacred
luxury
by
an
expansion
of
happiness
angelique
smiled
again
in
the
full
knowledge
that
death
was
at
her
heart
celebrating
its
victory
over
her
in
the
midst
of
this
glorious
joy
in
entering
the
cathedral
she
had
glanced
at
the
chapel
d
hautecoeur
where
slept
laurette
and
balbine
the
happy
dead
who
passed
away
when
very
young
in
the
full
happiness
of
their
love
at
this
last
hour
she
was
indeed
perfect
victorious
over
herself
reclaimed
renewed
having
no
longer
any
feeling
of
passion
or
of
pride
at
her
triumph
resigned
at
the
knowledge
that
her
life
was
fast
leaving
her
in
this
beautiful
hosanna
of
her
great
friend
the
blessed
old
church
when
she
fell
upon
her
knees
it
was
as
a
most
humble
most
submissive
servant
entirely
free
from
the
stain
of
original
sin
and
in
her
renunciation
she
was
thoroughly
content
the
abbe
cornille
having
mounted
to
the
altar
had
just
come
down
again
in
a
loud
voice
he
made
the
exhortation
he
cited
as
an
example
the
marriage
which
jesus
had
contracted
with
the
church
he
spoke
of
the
future
of
days
to
come
when
they
would
live
and
govern
themselves
in
the
true
faith
of
children
whom
they
must
bring
up
as
christians
and
then
once
more
in
face
of
this
hope
angelique
again
smiled
sweetly
while
felicien
trembled
at
the
idea
of
all
this
happiness
which
he
believed
to
be
assured
then
came
the
consecrated
demands
of
the
ritual
the
replies
which
united
them
together
for
their
entire
existence
the
decisive
yes
which
she
pronounced
in
a
voice
filled
with
emotion
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
and
which
he
said
in
a
much
louder
tone
and
with
a
tender
earnestness
the
irrevocable
step
was
taken
the
clergyman
had
placed
their
right
hands
together
one
clasping
the
other
as
he
repeated
the
prescribed
formula
i
unite
you
in
matrimony
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
but
there
were
still
rings
to
be
blessed
the
symbols
of
inviolable
fidelity
and
of
the
eternity
of
the
union
which
is
lasting
in
the
silver
basin
above
the
rings
of
gold
the
priest
shook
back
and
forth
the
asperges
brush
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
each
one
said
bless
o
lord
this
then
he
presented
them
to
the
young
couple
to
testify
to
them
that
the
church
sanctified
their
union
that
for
the
husband
henceforth
his
heart
was
sealed
and
no
other
woman
could
ever
enter
therein
and
the
husband
was
to
place
the
ring
upon
his
wife
s
finger
in
order
to
show
her
in
his
turn
that
henceforth
he
alone
among
all
men
existed
for
her
this
was
the
strict
union
without
end
the
sign
of
her
dependence
upon
him
which
would
recall
to
her
constantly
the
vows
she
had
made
it
was
also
the
promise
of
a
long
series
of
years
to
be
passed
together
as
if
by
this
little
circle
of
gold
they
were
attached
to
each
other
even
to
the
grave
and
while
the
priest
after
the
final
prayers
exhorted
them
once
more
angelique
wore
always
the
sweet
expression
of
renunciation
she
the
pure
soul
who
knew
the
truth
then
as
the
abbe
cornille
withdrew
accompanied
by
his
clerks
the
organs
again
burst
forth
with
peals
of
joy
monseigneur
motionless
until
now
bent
towards
the
young
couple
with
an
expression
of
great
mildness
in
his
eyes
still
on
their
knees
the
huberts
lifted
their
heads
blinded
by
their
tears
of
joy
and
the
enormous
depths
of
the
organs
peals
rolled
and
lost
themselves
by
degrees
in
a
hail
of
little
sharp
notes
which
were
swept
away
under
the
high
arches
like
the
morning
song
of
the
lark
there
was
a
long
waving
movement
a
sound
amongst
the
reverential
crowd
who
filled
to
overflowing
even
the
and
the
nave
the
church
decorated
with
flowers
glittering
with
the
taper
lights
seemed
beaming
with
joy
from
the
sacrament
then
there
were
nearly
two
hours
more
of
solemn
pomp
the
mass
being
sung
and
the
incense
being
burnt
the
officiating
clergyman
had
appeared
dressed
in
his
white
chasuble
accompanied
by
the
director
of
the
ceremonies
two
carrying
the
censer
and
the
vase
of
incense
and
two
acolytes
bearing
the
great
golden
candlesticks
in
which
were
lighted
tapers
the
presence
of
monseigneur
complicated
the
rites
the
salutations
and
the
kisses
every
moment
there
were
bowings
or
bendings
of
the
knee
which
kept
the
wings
of
the
surplices
in
constant
motion
in
the
old
stalls
with
their
backs
of
carved
wood
the
whole
chapter
of
canons
rose
and
then
again
at
other
times
it
was
as
if
a
breath
from
heaven
prostrated
at
once
the
clergy
by
whom
the
whole
apse
was
filled
the
officiating
priest
chanted
at
the
altar
when
he
had
finished
he
went
to
one
side
and
took
his
seat
while
the
choir
in
its
turn
for
a
long
time
continued
the
solemn
phrases
of
the
services
in
the
fine
clear
notes
of
the
young
choristers
light
and
delicate
as
the
flutes
of
archangels
among
these
voices
was
a
very
beautiful
one
unusually
pure
and
crystalline
that
of
a
young
girl
and
most
delicious
to
hear
it
was
said
to
be
that
of
mademoiselle
claire
de
voincourt
who
had
wished
and
obtained
permission
to
sing
at
this
marriage
which
had
been
so
wonderfully
secured
by
a
miracle
the
organ
which
accompanied
her
appeared
to
sigh
in
a
softened
manner
with
the
peaceful
calm
of
a
soul
at
ease
and
perfectly
happy
there
were
occasionally
short
spells
of
silence
then
the
music
burst
out
again
with
formidable
rollings
while
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
summoned
the
acolytes
with
their
chandeliers
and
conducted
the
to
the
officiating
clergyman
who
blessed
the
incenses
in
the
vases
now
there
was
constantly
heard
the
movements
of
the
censer
with
the
silvery
sound
of
the
little
chains
as
they
swung
back
and
forth
in
the
clear
light
there
was
in
the
air
a
bluish
cloud
as
they
incensed
the
bishop
the
clergy
the
altar
the
gospel
each
person
and
each
thing
in
its
turn
even
the
close
crowd
of
people
making
the
three
movements
to
the
right
to
the
left
and
in
front
to
mark
the
cross
in
the
meantime
angelique
and
felicien
on
their
knees
listened
devoutly
to
the
mass
which
is
significant
of
the
mysterious
consummation
of
the
marriage
of
jesus
and
the
church
there
had
been
given
into
the
hands
of
each
a
lighted
candle
symbol
of
the
purity
preserved
since
their
baptism
after
the
lord
s
prayer
they
had
remained
under
the
veil
which
is
a
sign
of
submission
of
bashfulness
and
of
modesty
and
during
this
time
the
priest
standing
at
the
side
of
the
altar
read
the
prescribed
prayers
they
still
held
the
lighted
tapers
which
serve
also
as
a
sign
of
remembrance
of
death
even
in
the
joy
of
a
happy
marriage
and
now
it
was
finished
the
offering
was
made
the
officiating
clergyman
went
away
accompanied
by
the
director
of
the
ceremonies
the
and
the
acolytes
after
having
prayed
god
to
bless
the
couple
in
order
that
they
might
live
to
see
and
multiply
their
children
even
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
at
this
moment
the
entire
cathedral
seemed
living
and
exulting
with
joy
the
march
triumphal
was
being
played
upon
the
organs
with
such
peals
that
they
made
the
old
edifice
fairly
tremble
the
entire
crowd
of
people
now
rose
quite
excited
and
straining
themselves
to
see
everything
women
even
mounted
on
the
chairs
and
there
were
rows
of
heads
as
far
back
as
the
dark
chapels
of
the
outer
in
this
vast
multitude
every
face
was
smiling
every
heart
beat
with
sympathetic
joy
in
this
final
adieu
the
thousands
of
tapers
appeared
to
burn
still
higher
stretching
out
their
flames
like
tongues
of
fire
vacillating
under
the
vaulted
arches
a
last
hosanna
from
the
clergy
rose
up
through
the
flowers
and
the
verdure
in
the
midst
of
the
luxury
of
the
ornaments
and
the
sacred
vessels
but
suddenly
the
great
portal
under
the
organs
was
opened
wide
and
the
sombre
walls
of
the
church
were
marked
as
if
by
great
sheets
of
daylight
it
was
the
clear
april
morning
the
living
sun
of
the
the
place
du
cloitre
which
was
now
seen
with
its
white
houses
and
there
another
crowd
still
more
numerous
awaited
the
coming
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
with
a
more
impatient
eagerness
which
already
showed
itself
by
gestures
and
acclamations
the
candles
had
grown
paler
and
the
noises
of
the
street
were
drowned
in
the
music
of
the
organs
with
a
slow
step
between
the
double
hedge
of
the
worshippers
angelique
and
felicien
turned
towards
the
after
the
triumphant
carrying
out
of
her
dream
she
was
now
about
to
enter
into
the
reality
of
life
this
porch
of
broad
sunlight
opened
into
the
world
of
which
as
yet
she
was
entirely
ignorant
she
retarded
her
steps
as
she
looked
earnestly
at
the
rows
of
houses
at
the
tumultuous
crowd
at
all
which
greeted
and
acclaimed
her
her
weakness
was
so
intense
that
her
husband
was
obliged
to
almost
carry
her
however
she
was
still
able
to
look
pleased
as
she
thought
of
the
princely
house
filled
with
jewels
and
with
queenly
toilettes
where
the
nuptial
chamber
awaited
her
all
decorated
with
white
silk
and
lace
almost
suffocated
she
was
obliged
to
stop
when
halfway
down
the
aisle
then
she
had
sufficient
strength
to
take
a
few
steps
more
she
glanced
at
her
wedding
ring
so
recently
placed
upon
her
finger
and
smiled
at
this
sign
of
eternal
union
then
on
the
threshold
of
the
great
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
which
went
down
into
the
place
du
cloitre
she
tottered
had
she
not
really
arrived
at
the
summit
of
her
happiness
was
not
it
there
that
the
joy
of
her
life
being
perfected
was
to
end
with
a
last
effort
she
raised
herself
as
much
as
possible
that
she
might
put
her
lips
upon
the
lips
of
felicien
and
in
that
kiss
of
love
she
passed
away
for
ever
but
her
death
was
without
sadness
monseigneur
with
his
habitual
movement
of
pastoral
benediction
aided
this
pure
soul
to
free
itself
from
the
frail
body
he
had
regained
his
calmness
and
had
once
more
found
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
sacred
calling
the
peace
the
huberts
unconscious
of
what
had
taken
place
were
still
kneeling
grateful
for
the
pardon
at
last
granted
them
and
feeling
as
if
into
existence
for
them
as
well
as
for
their
beloved
daughter
the
dream
was
accomplished
all
the
cathedral
and
the
whole
town
were
the
organs
sounded
louder
than
ever
the
bells
pealed
joyously
the
multitude
waited
to
greet
the
loving
couple
on
the
threshold
of
the
mystic
church
under
the
glorious
spring
sunlight
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
death
angelique
happy
and
pure
carried
away
suddenly
at
the
moment
of
the
realisation
of
her
fondest
dream
taken
into
the
heavenly
life
from
the
dark
romanesque
chapels
with
the
flamboyant
ceiling
from
among
the
gilded
decorations
and
paintings
of
ancient
times
in
the
full
paradise
of
golden
legends
what
more
could
she
have
asked
for
felicien
held
in
his
arms
simply
a
soft
and
tender
form
from
which
life
had
departed
this
bridal
robe
of
lace
and
pearls
seemed
like
the
light
wings
of
a
bird
still
warm
to
the
touch
for
a
long
time
he
had
well
known
that
he
could
claim
but
a
shadow
the
exquisite
vision
that
came
from
the
invisible
had
returned
to
the
invisible
it
was
merely
a
semblance
which
effaced
itself
the
vanishing
of
an
illusion
everything
is
only
a
dream
and
so
at
the
moment
of
supreme
earthly
happiness
angelique
had
disappeared
in
the
slight
breath
of
a
loving
kiss
