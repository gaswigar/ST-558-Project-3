please
don

all
the
way
from
charing
cross
to
dover
the
train
had
hammered
the
words
of
the
telegram
into
george
darrow
s
ears
ringing
every
change
of
irony
on
its
commonplace
syllables
rattling
them
out
like
a
discharge
of
musketry
letting
them
one
by
one
drip
slowly
and
coldly
into
his
brain
or
shaking
tossing
transposing
them
like
the
dice
in
some
game
of
the
gods
of
malice
and
now
as
he
emerged
from
his
compartment
at
the
pier
and
stood
facing
the
platform
and
the
angry
sea
beyond
they
leapt
out
at
him
as
if
from
the
crest
of
the
waves
stung
and
blinded
him
with
a
fresh
fury
of
derision
unexpected
obstacle
please
don
t
come
till
thirtieth
she
had
put
him
off
at
the
very
last
moment
and
for
the
second
time
put
him
off
with
all
her
sweet
reasonableness
and
for
one
of
her
usual
good
reasons
he
was
certain
that
this
reason
like
the
other
the
visit
of
her
husband
s
uncle
s
widow
would
be
good
but
it
was
that
very
certainty
which
chilled
him
the
fact
of
her
dealing
so
reasonably
with
their
case
shed
an
ironic
light
on
the
idea
that
there
had
been
any
exceptional
warmth
in
the
greeting
she
had
given
him
after
their
twelve
years
apart
they
had
found
each
other
again
in
london
some
three
months
previously
at
a
dinner
at
the
american
embassy
and
when
she
had
caught
sight
of
him
her
smile
had
been
like
a
red
rose
pinned
on
her
widow
s
mourning
he
still
felt
the
throb
of
surprise
with
which
among
the
stereotyped
faces
of
the
season
s
diners
he
had
come
upon
her
unexpected
face
with
the
dark
hair
banded
above
grave
eyes
eyes
in
which
he
had
recognized
every
little
curve
and
shadow
as
he
would
have
recognized
after
half
a
the
details
of
a
room
he
had
played
in
as
a
child
and
as
in
the
plumed
starred
crowd
she
had
stood
out
for
him
slender
secluded
and
different
so
he
had
felt
the
instant
their
glances
met
that
he
as
sharply
detached
himself
for
her
all
that
and
more
her
smile
had
said
had
said
not
merely
i
remember
but
i
remember
just
what
you
remember
almost
indeed
as
though
her
memory
had
aided
his
her
glance
flung
back
on
their
recaptured
moment
its
morning
brightness
certainly
when
their
distracted
ambassadress
with
the
cry
oh
you
know
leath
that
s
perfect
for
general
farnham
has
failed
me
had
waved
them
together
for
the
march
to
the
darrow
had
felt
a
slight
pressure
of
the
arm
on
his
a
pressure
faintly
but
unmistakably
emphasizing
the
exclamation
isn
t
it
wonderful
in
london
in
the
season
in
a
mob
little
enough
on
the
part
of
most
women
but
it
was
a
sign
of
leath
s
quality
that
every
movement
every
syllable
told
with
her
even
in
the
old
days
as
an
intent
girl
she
had
seldom
misplaced
her
light
strokes
and
darrow
on
meeting
her
again
had
immediately
felt
how
much
finer
and
surer
an
instrument
of
expression
she
had
become
their
evening
together
had
been
a
long
confirmation
of
this
feeling
she
had
talked
to
him
shyly
yet
frankly
of
what
had
happened
to
her
during
the
years
when
they
had
so
strangely
failed
to
meet
she
had
told
him
of
her
marriage
to
fraser
leath
and
of
her
subsequent
life
in
france
where
her
husband
s
mother
left
a
widow
in
his
youth
had
been
to
the
marquis
de
chantelle
and
where
partly
in
consequence
of
this
second
union
the
son
had
permanently
settled
himself
she
had
spoken
also
with
an
intense
eagerness
of
affection
of
her
little
girl
effie
who
was
now
nine
years
old
and
in
a
strain
hardly
less
tender
of
owen
leath
the
charming
clever
young
stepson
whom
her
husband
s
death
had
left
to
her
care
a
porter
stumbling
against
darrow
s
bags
roused
him
to
the
fact
that
he
still
obstructed
the
platform
inert
and
encumbering
as
his
luggage
crossing
sir
was
he
crossing
he
really
didn
t
know
but
for
lack
of
any
more
compelling
impulse
he
followed
the
porter
to
the
luggage
van
singled
out
his
property
and
turned
to
march
behind
it
down
the
as
the
fierce
wind
shouldered
him
building
up
a
crystal
wall
against
his
efforts
he
felt
anew
the
derision
of
his
case
nasty
weather
to
cross
sir
the
porter
threw
back
at
him
as
they
beat
their
way
down
the
narrow
walk
to
the
pier
nasty
weather
indeed
but
luckily
as
it
had
turned
out
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
darrow
should
cross
while
he
pushed
on
in
the
wake
of
his
luggage
his
thoughts
slipped
back
into
the
old
groove
he
had
once
or
twice
run
across
the
man
whom
anna
summers
had
preferred
to
him
and
since
he
had
met
her
again
he
had
been
exercising
his
imagination
on
the
picture
of
what
her
married
life
must
have
been
her
husband
had
struck
him
as
a
characteristic
specimen
of
the
kind
of
american
as
to
whom
one
is
not
quite
clear
whether
he
lives
in
europe
in
order
to
cultivate
an
art
or
cultivates
an
art
as
a
pretext
for
living
in
europe
leath
s
art
was
painting
but
he
practised
it
furtively
almost
clandestinely
with
the
disdain
of
a
man
of
the
world
for
anything
bordering
on
the
professional
while
he
devoted
himself
more
openly
and
with
religious
seriousness
to
the
collection
of
enamelled
he
was
blond
and
with
the
physical
distinction
that
comes
from
having
a
straight
figure
a
thin
nose
and
the
habit
of
looking
slightly
disgusted
as
who
should
not
in
a
world
where
authentic
were
growing
daily
harder
to
find
and
the
market
was
flooded
with
flagrant
forgeries
darrow
had
often
wondered
what
possibilities
of
communion
there
could
have
been
between
leath
and
his
wife
now
he
concluded
that
there
had
probably
been
none
leath
s
words
gave
no
hint
of
her
husband
s
having
failed
to
justify
her
choice
but
her
very
reticence
betrayed
her
she
spoke
of
him
with
a
kind
of
impersonal
seriousness
as
if
he
had
been
a
character
in
a
novel
or
a
figure
in
history
and
what
she
said
sounded
as
though
it
had
been
learned
by
heart
and
slightly
dulled
by
repetition
this
fact
immensely
increased
darrow
s
impression
that
his
meeting
with
her
had
annihilated
the
intervening
years
she
who
was
always
so
elusive
and
inaccessible
had
grown
suddenly
communicative
and
kind
had
opened
the
doors
of
her
past
and
tacitly
left
him
to
draw
his
own
conclusions
as
a
result
he
had
taken
leave
of
her
with
the
sense
that
he
was
a
being
singled
out
and
privileged
to
whom
she
had
entrusted
something
precious
to
keep
it
was
her
happiness
in
their
meeting
that
she
had
given
him
had
frankly
left
him
to
do
with
as
he
willed
and
the
frankness
of
the
gesture
doubled
the
beauty
of
the
gift
their
next
meeting
had
prolonged
and
deepened
the
impression
they
had
found
each
other
again
a
few
days
later
in
an
old
country
house
full
of
books
and
pictures
in
the
soft
landscape
of
southern
england
the
presence
of
a
large
party
with
all
its
aimless
and
agitated
displacements
had
served
only
to
isolate
the
pair
and
give
them
at
least
to
the
young
man
s
fancy
a
deeper
feeling
of
communion
and
their
days
there
had
been
like
some
musical
prelude
where
the
instruments
breathing
low
seem
to
hold
back
the
waves
of
sound
that
press
against
them
leath
on
this
occasion
was
no
less
kind
than
before
but
she
contrived
to
make
him
understand
that
what
was
so
inevitably
coming
was
not
to
come
too
soon
it
was
not
that
she
showed
any
hesitation
as
to
the
issue
but
rather
that
she
seemed
to
wish
not
to
miss
any
stage
in
the
gradual
reflowering
of
their
intimacy
darrow
for
his
part
was
content
to
wait
if
she
wished
it
he
remembered
that
once
in
america
when
she
was
a
girl
and
he
had
gone
to
stay
with
her
family
in
the
country
she
had
been
out
when
he
arrived
and
her
mother
had
told
him
to
look
for
her
in
the
garden
she
was
not
in
the
garden
but
beyond
it
he
had
seen
her
approaching
down
a
long
shady
path
without
hastening
her
step
she
had
smiled
and
signed
to
him
to
wait
and
charmed
by
the
lights
and
shadows
that
played
upon
her
as
she
moved
and
by
the
pleasure
of
watching
her
slow
advance
toward
him
he
had
obeyed
her
and
stood
still
and
so
she
seemed
now
to
be
walking
to
him
down
the
years
the
light
and
shade
of
old
memories
and
new
hopes
playing
variously
on
her
and
each
step
giving
him
the
vision
of
a
different
grace
she
did
not
waver
or
turn
aside
he
knew
she
would
come
straight
to
where
he
stood
but
something
in
her
eyes
said
wait
and
again
he
obeyed
and
waited
on
the
fourth
day
an
unexpected
event
threw
out
his
calculations
summoned
to
town
by
the
arrival
in
england
of
her
husband
s
mother
she
left
without
giving
darrow
the
chance
he
had
counted
on
and
he
cursed
himself
for
a
dilatory
blunderer
still
his
disappointment
was
tempered
by
the
certainty
of
being
with
her
again
before
she
left
for
france
and
they
did
in
fact
see
each
other
in
london
there
however
the
atmosphere
had
changed
with
the
conditions
he
could
not
say
that
she
avoided
him
or
even
that
she
was
a
shade
less
glad
to
see
him
but
she
was
beset
by
family
duties
and
as
he
thought
a
little
too
readily
resigned
to
them
the
marquise
de
chantelle
as
darrow
soon
perceived
had
the
same
mild
formidableness
as
the
late
leath
a
sort
of
insistent
before
which
every
one
about
her
gave
way
it
was
perhaps
the
shadow
of
this
lady
s
presence
pervasive
even
during
her
actual
brief
eclipses
that
subdued
and
silenced
leath
the
latter
was
moreover
preoccupied
about
her
stepson
who
soon
after
receiving
his
degree
at
harvard
had
been
rescued
from
a
stormy
and
finally
after
some
months
of
troubled
drifting
had
yielded
to
his
s
counsel
and
gone
up
to
oxford
for
a
year
of
supplementary
study
thither
leath
went
once
or
twice
to
visit
him
and
her
remaining
days
were
packed
with
family
obligations
getting
as
she
phrased
it
frocks
and
governesses
for
her
little
girl
who
had
been
left
in
france
and
having
to
devote
the
remaining
hours
to
long
shopping
expeditions
with
her
nevertheless
during
her
brief
escapes
from
duty
darrow
had
had
time
to
feel
her
safe
in
the
custody
of
his
devotion
set
apart
for
some
inevitable
hour
and
the
last
evening
at
the
theatre
between
the
overshadowing
marquise
and
the
unsuspicious
owen
they
had
had
an
almost
decisive
exchange
of
words
now
in
the
rattle
of
the
wind
about
his
ears
darrow
continued
to
hear
the
mocking
echo
of
her
message
unexpected
in
such
an
existence
as
leath
s
at
once
so
ordered
and
so
exposed
he
knew
how
small
a
complication
might
assume
the
magnitude
of
an
obstacle
yet
even
allowing
as
impartially
as
his
state
of
mind
permitted
for
the
fact
that
with
her
always
and
her
stepson
intermittently
under
her
roof
her
lot
involved
a
hundred
small
accommodations
generally
foreign
to
the
freedom
of
widowhood
even
so
he
could
not
but
think
that
the
very
ingenuity
bred
of
such
conditions
might
have
helped
her
to
find
a
way
out
of
them
no
her
reason
whatever
it
was
could
in
this
case
be
nothing
but
a
pretext
unless
he
leaned
to
the
less
flattering
alternative
that
any
reason
seemed
good
enough
for
postponing
him
certainly
if
her
welcome
had
meant
what
he
imagined
she
could
not
for
the
second
time
within
a
few
weeks
have
submitted
so
tamely
to
the
disarrangement
of
their
plans
a
disarrangement
which
his
official
duties
considered
might
for
all
she
knew
result
in
his
not
being
able
to
go
to
her
for
months
please
don
t
come
till
the
thirtieth
and
it
was
now
the
fifteenth
she
flung
back
the
fortnight
on
his
hands
as
if
he
had
been
an
idler
indifferent
to
dates
instead
of
an
active
young
diplomatist
who
to
respond
to
her
call
had
had
to
hew
his
way
through
a
very
jungle
of
engagements
please
don
t
come
till
that
was
all
not
the
shadow
of
an
excuse
or
a
regret
not
even
the
perfunctory
have
written
with
which
it
is
usual
to
soften
such
blows
she
didn
t
want
him
and
had
taken
the
shortest
way
to
tell
him
so
even
in
his
first
moment
of
exasperation
it
struck
him
as
characteristic
that
she
should
not
have
padded
her
postponement
with
a
fib
certainly
her
moral
angles
were
not
draped
if
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
she
d
have
refused
in
the
same
language
but
thank
heaven
i
haven
t
he
reflected
these
considerations
which
had
been
with
him
every
yard
of
the
way
from
london
reached
a
climax
of
irony
as
he
was
drawn
into
the
crowd
on
the
pier
it
did
not
soften
his
feelings
to
remember
that
but
for
her
lack
of
forethought
he
might
at
this
harsh
end
of
the
stormy
may
day
have
been
sitting
before
his
club
fire
in
london
instead
of
shivering
in
the
damp
human
herd
on
the
pier
admitting
the
sex
s
traditional
right
to
change
she
might
at
least
have
advised
him
of
hers
by
telegraphing
directly
to
his
rooms
but
in
spite
of
their
exchange
of
letters
she
had
apparently
failed
to
note
his
address
and
a
breathless
emissary
had
rushed
from
the
embassy
to
pitch
her
telegram
into
his
compartment
as
the
train
was
moving
from
the
station
yes
he
had
given
her
chance
enough
to
learn
where
he
lived
and
this
minor
proof
of
her
indifference
became
as
he
jammed
his
way
through
the
crowd
the
main
point
of
his
grievance
against
her
and
of
his
derision
of
himself
half
way
down
the
pier
the
prod
of
an
umbrella
increased
his
exasperation
by
rousing
him
to
the
fact
that
it
was
raining
instantly
the
narrow
ledge
became
a
of
thrusting
slanting
parrying
domes
the
wind
rose
with
the
rain
and
the
harried
wretches
exposed
to
this
double
assault
wreaked
on
their
neighbours
the
vengeance
they
could
not
take
on
the
elements
darrow
whose
healthy
enjoyment
of
life
made
him
in
general
a
good
traveller
tolerant
of
agglutinated
humanity
felt
himself
obscurely
outraged
by
these
promiscuous
contacts
it
was
as
though
all
the
people
about
him
had
taken
his
measure
and
known
his
plight
as
though
they
were
contemptuously
bumping
and
shoving
him
like
the
inconsiderable
thing
he
had
become
she
doesn
t
want
you
doesn
t
want
you
doesn
t
want
you
their
umbrellas
and
their
elbows
seemed
to
say
he
had
rashly
vowed
when
the
telegram
was
flung
into
his
window
at
any
rate
i
won
t
turn
back
as
though
it
might
cause
the
sender
a
malicious
joy
to
have
him
retrace
his
steps
rather
than
keep
on
to
paris
now
he
perceived
the
absurdity
of
the
vow
and
thanked
his
stars
that
he
need
not
plunge
to
no
purpose
into
the
fury
of
waves
outside
the
harbour
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
he
turned
back
to
look
for
his
porter
but
the
contiguity
of
dripping
umbrellas
made
signalling
impossible
and
perceiving
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
the
man
he
scrambled
up
again
to
the
platform
as
he
reached
it
a
descending
umbrella
caught
him
in
the
and
the
next
moment
bent
sideways
by
the
wind
it
turned
inside
out
and
soared
up
at
the
end
of
a
helpless
female
arm
darrow
caught
the
umbrella
lowered
its
inverted
ribs
and
looked
up
at
the
face
it
exposed
to
him
wait
a
minute
he
said
you
can
t
stay
as
he
spoke
a
surge
of
the
crowd
drove
the
owner
of
the
umbrella
abruptly
down
on
him
darrow
steadied
her
with
extended
arms
and
regaining
her
footing
she
cried
out
oh
dear
oh
dear
it
s
in
ribbons
her
lifted
face
fresh
and
flushed
in
the
driving
rain
woke
in
him
a
memory
of
having
seen
it
at
a
distant
time
and
in
a
vaguely
unsympathetic
setting
but
it
was
no
moment
to
follow
up
such
clues
and
the
face
was
obviously
one
to
make
its
way
on
its
own
merits
its
possessor
had
dropped
her
bag
and
bundles
to
clutch
at
the
tattered
umbrella
i
bought
it
only
yesterday
at
the
stores
and
yes
it
s
utterly
done
for
she
lamented
darrow
smiled
at
the
intensity
of
her
distress
it
was
food
for
the
moralist
that
side
by
side
with
such
catastrophes
as
his
human
nature
was
still
agitating
itself
over
its
microscopic
woes
here
s
mine
if
you
want
it
he
shouted
back
at
her
through
the
shouting
of
the
gale
the
offer
caused
the
young
lady
to
look
at
him
more
intently
why
it
s
darrow
she
exclaimed
and
then
all
radiant
recognition
oh
thank
you
we
ll
share
it
if
you
she
knew
him
then
and
he
knew
her
but
how
and
where
had
they
met
he
put
aside
the
problem
for
subsequent
solution
and
drawing
her
into
a
more
sheltered
corner
bade
her
wait
till
he
could
find
his
porter
when
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
back
with
his
recovered
property
and
the
news
that
the
boat
would
not
leave
till
the
tide
had
turned
she
showed
no
concern
not
for
two
hours
how
lucky
then
i
can
find
my
trunk
ordinarily
darrow
would
have
felt
little
disposed
to
involve
himself
in
the
adventure
of
a
young
female
who
had
lost
her
trunk
but
at
the
moment
he
was
glad
of
any
pretext
for
activity
even
should
he
decide
to
take
the
next
up
train
from
dover
he
still
had
a
yawning
hour
to
fill
and
the
obvious
remedy
was
to
devote
it
to
the
loveliness
in
distress
under
his
umbrella
you
ve
lost
a
trunk
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it
pleased
him
that
she
did
not
return
the
conventional
oh
would
you
instead
she
corrected
him
with
a
laugh
not
a
trunk
but
my
trunk
i
ve
no
other
and
then
added
briskly
you
d
better
first
see
to
getting
your
own
things
on
the
this
made
him
answer
as
if
to
give
substance
to
his
plans
by
discussing
them
i
don
t
actually
know
that
i
m
going
not
going
over
well
perhaps
not
by
this
again
he
felt
a
stealing
indecision
i
may
probably
have
to
go
back
to
london
i
m
i
m
waiting
expecting
a
letter
she
ll
think
me
a
defaulter
he
reflected
but
meanwhile
there
s
plenty
of
time
to
find
your
he
picked
up
his
companion
s
bundles
and
offered
her
an
arm
which
enabled
her
to
press
her
slight
person
more
closely
under
his
umbrella
and
as
thus
linked
they
beat
their
way
back
to
the
platform
pulled
together
and
apart
like
marionettes
on
the
wires
of
the
wind
he
continued
to
wonder
where
he
could
have
seen
her
he
had
immediately
classed
her
as
a
compatriot
her
small
nose
her
clear
tints
a
kind
of
sketchy
delicacy
in
her
face
as
though
she
had
been
brightly
but
lightly
washed
in
with
all
confirmed
the
evidence
of
her
high
sweet
voice
and
of
her
quick
incessant
gestures
she
was
clearly
an
american
but
with
the
loose
native
quality
strained
through
a
closer
woof
of
manners
the
composite
product
of
an
enquiring
and
adaptable
race
all
this
however
did
not
help
him
to
fit
a
name
to
her
for
just
such
instances
were
perpetually
pouring
through
the
london
embassy
and
the
etched
and
angular
american
was
becoming
rarer
than
the
fluid
type
more
puzzling
than
the
fact
of
his
being
unable
to
identify
her
was
the
persistent
sense
connecting
her
with
something
uncomfortable
and
distasteful
so
pleasant
a
vision
as
that
gleaming
up
at
him
between
wet
brown
hair
and
wet
brown
boa
should
have
evoked
only
associations
as
pleasing
but
each
effort
to
fit
her
image
into
his
past
resulted
in
the
same
memories
of
boredom
and
a
vague
discomfort
ii
don
t
you
remember
me
now
at
murrett
s
she
threw
the
question
at
darrow
across
a
table
of
the
quiet
to
which
after
a
vainly
prolonged
quest
for
her
trunk
he
had
suggested
taking
her
for
a
cup
of
tea
in
this
musty
retreat
she
had
removed
her
dripping
hat
hung
it
on
the
fender
to
dry
and
stretched
herself
on
tiptoe
in
front
of
the
round
mirror
above
the
mantel
vases
of
dyed
immortelles
while
she
ran
her
fingers
through
her
hair
the
gesture
had
acted
on
darrow
s
numb
feelings
as
the
glow
of
the
fire
acted
on
his
circulation
and
when
he
had
asked
aren
t
your
feet
wet
too
and
after
frank
inspection
of
a
sole
she
had
answered
cheerfully
no
luckily
i
had
on
my
new
boots
he
began
to
feel
that
human
intercourse
would
still
be
tolerable
if
it
were
always
as
free
from
formality
the
removal
of
his
companion
s
hat
besides
provoking
this
reflection
gave
him
his
first
full
sight
of
her
face
and
this
was
so
favourable
that
the
name
she
now
pronounced
fell
on
him
with
a
quite
disproportionate
shock
of
dismay
oh
murrett
s
was
it
there
he
remembered
her
now
of
course
remembered
her
as
one
of
the
shadowy
sidling
presences
in
the
background
of
that
awful
house
in
chelsea
one
of
the
dumb
appendages
of
the
shrieking
unescapable
murrett
into
whose
talons
he
had
fallen
in
the
course
of
his
pursuit
of
lady
ulrica
crispin
oh
the
taste
of
stale
follies
how
insipid
it
was
yet
how
it
clung
i
used
to
pass
you
on
the
stairs
she
reminded
him
yes
he
had
seen
her
slip
by
he
recalled
it
now
as
he
dashed
up
to
the
in
quest
of
lady
ulrica
the
thought
made
him
steal
a
longer
look
how
could
such
a
face
have
been
merged
in
the
murrett
mob
its
fugitive
slanting
lines
that
lent
themselves
to
all
manner
of
tender
tilts
and
foreshortenings
had
the
freakish
grace
of
some
young
head
of
the
italian
comedy
the
hair
stood
up
from
her
forehead
in
a
boyish
and
its
colour
matched
her
auburn
eyes
flecked
with
black
and
the
little
brown
spot
on
her
cheek
between
the
ear
that
was
meant
to
have
a
rose
behind
it
and
the
chin
that
should
have
rested
on
a
ruff
when
she
smiled
the
left
corner
of
her
mouth
went
up
a
little
higher
than
the
right
and
her
smile
began
in
her
eyes
and
ran
down
to
her
lips
in
two
lines
of
light
he
had
dashed
past
that
to
reach
lady
ulrica
crispin
but
of
course
you
wouldn
t
remember
me
she
was
saying
my
name
is
viner
sophy
not
remember
her
but
of
course
he
did
he
was
genuinely
sure
of
it
now
you
re
murrett
s
niece
he
declared
she
shook
her
head
no
not
even
that
only
her
her
reader
do
you
mean
to
say
she
ever
reads
miss
viner
enjoyed
his
wonder
dear
no
but
i
wrote
notes
and
made
up
the
and
walked
the
dogs
and
saw
bores
for
darrow
groaned
that
must
have
been
rather
bad
yes
but
nothing
like
as
bad
as
being
her
that
i
can
well
believe
i
m
glad
to
hear
he
added
that
you
put
it
all
in
the
past
she
seemed
to
droop
a
little
at
the
allusion
then
she
lifted
her
chin
with
a
jerk
of
defiance
yes
all
is
at
an
end
between
us
we
ve
just
parted
in
tears
but
not
in
silence
just
parted
do
you
mean
to
say
you
ve
been
there
all
this
time
ever
since
you
used
to
come
there
to
see
lady
ulrica
does
it
seem
to
you
so
awfully
long
ago
the
unexpectedness
of
the
thrust
as
well
as
its
doubtful
taste
chilled
his
growing
enjoyment
of
her
chatter
he
had
really
been
getting
to
like
her
had
recovered
under
the
candid
approval
of
her
eye
his
usual
sense
of
being
a
personable
young
man
with
all
the
privileges
pertaining
to
the
state
instead
of
the
anonymous
rag
of
humanity
he
had
felt
himself
in
the
crowd
on
the
pier
it
annoyed
him
at
that
particular
moment
to
be
reminded
that
naturalness
is
not
always
consonant
with
taste
she
seemed
to
guess
his
thought
you
don
t
like
my
saying
that
you
came
for
lady
ulrica
she
asked
leaning
over
the
table
to
pour
herself
a
second
cup
of
tea
he
liked
her
quickness
at
any
rate
it
s
better
he
laughed
than
your
thinking
i
came
for
murrett
oh
we
never
thought
anybody
came
for
murrett
it
was
always
for
something
else
the
music
or
the
cook
when
there
was
a
good
one
or
the
other
people
generally
one
of
the
other
i
she
was
amusing
and
that
in
his
present
mood
was
more
to
his
purpose
than
the
exact
shade
of
her
taste
it
was
odd
too
to
discover
suddenly
that
the
blurred
tapestry
of
murrett
s
background
had
all
the
while
been
alive
and
full
of
eyes
now
with
a
pair
of
them
looking
into
his
he
was
conscious
of
a
queer
reversal
of
perspective
who
were
the
we
were
you
a
cloud
of
witnesses
there
were
a
good
many
of
she
smiled
let
me
see
who
was
there
in
your
time
bolt
and
mademoiselle
and
professor
didymus
and
the
polish
countess
don
t
you
remember
the
polish
countess
she
and
played
accompaniments
and
murrett
chucked
her
because
didymus
accused
her
of
hypnotizing
the
professor
but
of
course
you
don
t
remember
we
were
all
invisible
to
you
but
we
could
see
and
we
all
used
to
wonder
about
you
again
darrow
felt
a
redness
in
the
temples
what
about
me
well
whether
it
was
you
or
she
who
he
winced
but
hid
his
disapproval
it
made
the
time
pass
to
listen
to
her
and
what
if
one
may
ask
was
your
conclusion
well
bolt
and
mademoiselle
and
the
countess
naturally
thought
it
was
she
but
professor
didymus
and
jimmy
brance
especially
jimmy
just
a
moment
who
on
earth
is
jimmy
brance
she
exclaimed
in
wonder
you
were
absorbed
not
to
remember
jimmy
brance
he
must
have
been
right
about
you
after
she
let
her
amused
scrutiny
dwell
on
him
but
how
could
you
she
was
false
from
head
to
foot
false
in
spite
of
time
and
satiety
the
male
instinct
of
ownership
rose
up
and
repudiated
the
charge
miss
viner
caught
his
look
and
laughed
oh
i
only
meant
externally
you
see
she
often
used
to
come
to
my
room
after
tennis
or
to
touch
up
in
the
evenings
when
they
were
going
on
and
i
assure
you
she
took
apart
like
a
puzzle
in
fact
i
used
to
say
to
jimmy
just
to
make
him
wild
i
ll
bet
you
anything
you
like
there
s
nothing
wrong
because
i
know
she
d
never
dare
un
she
broke
the
word
in
two
and
her
quick
blush
made
her
face
like
a
rose
shading
to
the
deeper
pink
of
the
centre
the
situation
was
saved
for
darrow
by
an
abrupt
rush
of
memories
and
he
gave
way
to
a
mirth
which
she
as
frankly
echoed
of
course
she
gasped
through
her
laughter
i
only
said
it
to
tease
jimmy
her
amusement
obscurely
annoyed
him
oh
you
re
all
alike
he
exclaimed
moved
by
an
unaccountable
sense
of
disappointment
she
caught
him
up
in
a
flash
she
didn
t
miss
things
you
say
that
because
you
think
i
m
spiteful
and
envious
yes
i
was
envious
of
lady
ulrica
oh
not
on
account
of
you
or
jimmy
brance
simply
because
she
had
almost
all
the
things
i
ve
always
wanted
clothes
and
fun
and
motors
and
admiration
and
yachting
and
paris
why
paris
alone
would
be
enough
and
how
do
you
suppose
a
girl
can
see
that
sort
of
thing
about
her
day
after
day
and
never
wonder
why
some
women
who
don
t
seem
to
have
any
more
right
to
it
have
it
all
tumbled
into
their
laps
while
others
are
writing
dinner
invitations
and
straightening
out
accounts
and
copying
visiting
lists
and
finishing
and
matching
ribbons
and
seeing
that
the
dogs
get
their
sulphur
one
looks
in
one
s
glass
after
all
she
launched
the
closing
words
at
him
on
a
cry
that
lifted
them
above
the
petulance
of
vanity
but
his
sense
of
her
words
was
lost
in
the
surprise
of
her
face
under
the
flying
clouds
of
her
excitement
it
was
no
longer
a
shallow
but
a
darkening
gleaming
mirror
that
might
give
back
strange
depths
of
feeling
the
girl
had
stuff
in
her
he
saw
it
and
she
seemed
to
catch
the
perception
in
his
eyes
that
s
the
kind
of
education
i
got
at
murrett
s
and
i
never
had
any
other
she
said
with
a
shrug
good
lord
were
you
there
so
long
five
years
i
stuck
it
out
longer
than
any
of
the
she
spoke
as
though
it
were
something
to
be
proud
of
well
thank
god
you
re
out
of
it
now
again
a
just
perceptible
shadow
crossed
her
face
yes
i
m
out
of
it
now
fast
and
what
if
i
may
ask
are
you
doing
next
she
brooded
a
moment
behind
drooped
lids
then
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
i
m
going
to
paris
to
study
for
the
the
stage
darrow
stared
at
her
dismayed
all
his
confused
contradictory
impressions
assumed
a
new
aspect
at
this
announcement
and
to
hide
his
surprise
he
added
lightly
ah
then
you
will
have
paris
after
all
hardly
lady
ulrica
s
paris
it
s
not
likely
to
be
roses
roses
all
the
it
s
not
real
compassion
prompted
him
to
continue
have
you
any
any
influence
you
can
count
on
she
gave
a
somewhat
flippant
little
laugh
none
but
my
own
i
ve
never
had
any
other
to
count
he
passed
over
the
obvious
reply
but
have
you
any
idea
how
the
profession
is
i
know
i
m
trite
i
ve
a
very
clear
idea
but
i
couldn
t
go
on
as
i
of
course
not
but
since
as
you
say
you
d
stuck
it
out
longer
than
any
of
the
others
couldn
t
you
at
least
have
held
on
till
you
were
sure
of
some
kind
of
an
opening
she
made
no
reply
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
a
listless
glance
to
the
window
oughtn
t
we
be
starting
she
asked
with
a
lofty
assumption
of
indifference
that
might
have
been
lady
ulrica
s
darrow
surprised
by
the
change
but
accepting
her
rebuff
as
a
phase
of
what
he
guessed
to
be
a
confused
and
tormented
mood
rose
from
his
seat
and
lifted
her
jacket
from
the
on
which
she
had
hung
it
to
dry
as
he
held
it
toward
her
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
the
truth
is
we
quarrelled
she
broke
out
and
i
left
last
night
without
my
dinner
and
without
my
ah
he
groaned
with
a
sharp
perception
of
all
the
sordid
dangers
that
might
attend
such
a
break
with
murrett
and
without
a
character
she
added
as
she
slipped
her
arms
into
the
jacket
and
without
a
trunk
as
it
appears
but
didn
t
you
say
that
before
going
there
d
be
time
for
another
look
at
the
station
there
was
time
for
another
look
at
the
station
but
the
look
again
resulted
in
disappointment
since
her
trunk
was
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
huge
heap
disgorged
by
the
london
express
the
fact
caused
miss
viner
a
moment
s
perturbation
but
she
promptly
adjusted
herself
to
the
necessity
of
proceeding
on
her
journey
and
her
decision
confirmed
darrow
s
vague
resolve
to
go
to
paris
instead
of
retracing
his
way
to
london
miss
viner
seemed
cheered
at
the
prospect
of
his
company
and
sustained
by
his
offer
to
telegraph
to
charing
cross
for
the
missing
trunk
and
he
left
her
to
wait
in
the
fly
while
he
hastened
back
to
the
telegraph
office
the
enquiry
despatched
he
was
turning
away
from
the
desk
when
another
thought
struck
him
and
he
went
back
and
indited
a
message
to
his
servant
in
london
if
any
letters
with
french
received
since
departure
forward
immediately
to
terminus
hotel
gare
du
nord
then
he
rejoined
miss
viner
and
they
drove
off
through
the
rain
to
the
pier
iii
almost
as
soon
as
the
train
left
calais
her
head
had
dropped
back
into
the
corner
and
she
had
fallen
asleep
sitting
opposite
in
the
compartment
from
which
he
had
contrived
to
have
other
travellers
excluded
darrow
looked
at
her
curiously
he
had
never
seen
a
face
that
changed
so
quickly
a
moment
since
it
had
danced
like
a
field
of
daisies
in
a
summer
breeze
now
under
the
pallid
oscillating
light
of
the
lamp
overhead
it
wore
the
hard
stamp
of
experience
as
of
a
soft
thing
chilled
into
shape
before
its
curves
had
rounded
and
it
moved
him
to
see
that
care
already
stole
upon
her
when
she
slept
the
story
she
had
imparted
to
him
in
the
wheezing
shaking
cabin
and
at
the
calais
buffet
where
he
had
insisted
on
offering
her
the
dinner
she
had
missed
at
murrett
s
had
given
a
distincter
outline
to
her
figure
from
the
moment
of
entering
the
new
york
to
which
a
preoccupied
guardian
had
hastily
consigned
her
after
the
death
of
her
parents
she
had
found
herself
alone
in
a
busy
and
indifferent
world
her
youthful
history
might
in
fact
have
been
summed
up
in
the
statement
that
everybody
had
been
too
busy
to
look
after
her
her
guardian
a
drudge
in
a
big
banking
house
was
absorbed
by
the
office
the
guardian
s
wife
by
her
health
and
her
religion
and
an
elder
sister
laura
married
unmarried
remarried
and
pursuing
through
all
these
alternating
phases
some
vaguely
artistic
ideal
on
which
the
guardian
and
his
wife
looked
askance
had
as
darrow
conjectured
taken
their
disapproval
as
a
pretext
for
not
troubling
herself
about
poor
sophy
to
whom
perhaps
for
this
reason
she
had
remained
the
incarnation
of
remote
romantic
possibilities
in
the
course
of
time
a
sudden
stroke
of
the
guardian
s
had
thrown
his
personal
affairs
into
a
state
of
confusion
from
which
after
his
widely
lamented
death
it
became
evident
that
it
would
not
be
possible
to
extricate
his
ward
s
inheritance
no
one
deplored
this
more
sincerely
than
his
widow
who
saw
in
it
one
more
proof
of
her
husband
s
life
having
been
sacrificed
to
the
innumerable
duties
imposed
on
him
and
who
could
hardly
but
for
the
counsels
of
religion
have
brought
herself
to
pardon
the
young
girl
for
her
indirect
share
in
hastening
his
end
sophy
did
not
resent
this
point
of
view
she
was
really
much
sorrier
for
her
guardian
s
death
than
for
the
loss
of
her
insignificant
fortune
the
latter
had
represented
only
the
means
of
holding
her
in
bondage
and
its
disappearance
was
the
occasion
of
her
immediate
plunge
into
the
wide
bright
sea
of
life
surrounding
the
island
of
her
captivity
she
had
first
landed
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
the
ladies
who
had
directed
her
education
in
a
fifth
avenue
where
for
a
few
months
she
acted
as
a
buffer
between
three
autocratic
infants
and
their
bodyguard
of
nurses
and
teachers
the
attentions
of
their
father
s
valet
had
caused
her
to
fly
this
sheltered
spot
against
the
express
advice
of
her
educational
superiors
who
implied
that
in
their
own
case
refinement
and
had
always
sufficed
to
keep
the
most
ungovernable
passions
at
bay
the
experience
of
the
guardian
s
widow
having
been
precisely
similar
and
the
deplorable
precedent
of
laura
s
career
being
present
to
all
their
minds
none
of
these
ladies
felt
any
obligation
to
intervene
farther
in
sophy
s
affairs
and
she
was
accordingly
left
to
her
own
resources
a
schoolmate
from
the
rocky
mountains
who
was
taking
her
father
and
mother
to
europe
had
suggested
sophy
s
accompanying
them
and
going
round
with
her
while
her
progenitors
in
the
care
of
the
courier
nursed
their
ailments
at
a
fashionable
bath
darrow
gathered
that
the
going
round
with
mamie
hoke
was
a
varied
and
diverting
process
but
this
relatively
brilliant
phase
of
sophy
s
career
was
cut
short
by
the
elopement
of
the
inconsiderate
mamie
with
a
matinee
idol
who
had
followed
her
from
new
york
and
by
the
precipitate
return
of
her
parents
to
negotiate
for
the
repurchase
of
their
child
it
was
then
after
an
interval
of
repose
with
compassionate
but
impecunious
american
friends
in
paris
that
miss
viner
had
been
drawn
into
the
turbid
current
of
murrett
s
career
the
impecunious
compatriots
had
found
murrett
for
her
and
it
was
partly
on
their
account
because
they
were
such
dears
and
so
unconscious
poor
confiding
things
of
what
they
were
letting
her
in
for
that
sophy
had
stuck
it
out
so
long
in
the
dreadful
house
in
chelsea
the
farlows
she
explained
to
darrow
were
the
best
friends
she
had
ever
had
and
the
only
ones
who
had
ever
been
decent
about
laura
whom
they
had
seen
once
and
intensely
admired
but
even
after
twenty
years
of
paris
they
were
the
most
incorrigibly
inexperienced
angels
and
quite
persuaded
that
murrett
was
a
woman
of
great
intellectual
eminence
and
the
house
at
chelsea
the
last
of
the
salons
darrow
knew
what
she
meant
and
she
hadn
t
liked
to
undeceive
them
knowing
that
to
do
so
would
be
virtually
to
throw
herself
back
on
their
hands
and
feeling
moreover
after
her
previous
experiences
the
urgent
need
of
gaining
at
any
cost
a
name
for
stability
besides
which
she
threw
it
off
with
a
slight
laugh
no
other
chance
in
all
these
years
had
happened
to
come
to
her
she
had
brushed
in
this
outline
of
her
career
with
light
rapid
strokes
and
in
a
tone
of
fatalism
oddly
untinged
by
bitterness
darrow
perceived
that
she
classified
people
according
to
their
greater
or
less
luck
in
life
but
she
appeared
to
harbour
no
resentment
against
the
undefined
power
which
dispensed
the
gift
in
such
unequal
measure
things
came
one
s
way
or
they
didn
t
and
meanwhile
one
could
only
look
on
and
make
the
most
of
small
compensations
such
as
watching
the
show
at
murrett
s
and
talking
over
the
lady
ulricas
and
other
footlight
figures
and
at
any
moment
of
course
a
turn
of
the
kaleidoscope
might
suddenly
toss
a
bright
spangle
into
the
grey
pattern
of
one
s
days
this
philosophy
was
not
without
charm
to
a
young
man
accustomed
to
more
traditional
views
george
darrow
had
had
a
fairly
varied
experience
of
feminine
types
but
the
women
he
had
frequented
had
either
been
pronouncedly
ladies
or
they
had
not
grateful
to
both
for
ministering
to
the
more
complex
masculine
nature
and
disposed
to
assume
that
they
had
been
evolved
if
not
designed
to
that
end
he
had
instinctively
kept
the
two
groups
apart
in
his
mind
avoiding
that
intermediate
society
which
attempts
to
conciliate
both
theories
of
life
bohemianism
seemed
to
him
a
cheaper
convention
than
the
other
two
and
he
liked
above
all
people
who
went
as
far
as
they
could
in
their
own
line
liked
his
ladies
and
their
rivals
to
be
equally
unashamed
of
showing
for
exactly
what
they
were
he
had
not
indeed
the
fact
of
lady
ulrica
was
there
to
remind
him
been
without
his
experience
of
a
third
type
but
that
experience
had
left
him
with
a
contemptuous
distaste
for
the
woman
who
uses
the
privileges
of
one
class
to
shelter
the
customs
of
another
as
to
young
girls
he
had
never
thought
much
about
them
since
his
early
love
for
the
girl
who
had
become
leath
that
episode
seemed
as
he
looked
back
on
it
to
bear
no
more
relation
to
reality
than
a
pale
decorative
design
to
the
confused
richness
of
a
summer
landscape
he
no
longer
understood
the
violent
impulses
and
dreamy
pauses
of
his
own
young
heart
or
the
inscrutable
abandonments
and
reluctances
of
hers
he
had
known
a
moment
of
anguish
at
losing
her
the
mad
plunge
of
youthful
instincts
against
the
barrier
of
fate
but
the
first
wave
of
stronger
sensation
had
swept
away
all
but
the
outline
of
their
story
and
the
memory
of
anna
summers
had
made
the
image
of
the
young
girl
sacred
but
the
class
uninteresting
such
generalisations
belonged
however
to
an
earlier
stage
of
his
experience
the
more
he
saw
of
life
the
more
incalculable
he
found
it
and
he
had
learned
to
yield
to
his
impressions
without
feeling
the
youthful
need
of
relating
them
to
others
it
was
the
girl
in
the
opposite
seat
who
had
roused
in
him
the
dormant
habit
of
comparison
she
was
distinguished
from
the
daughters
of
wealth
by
her
avowed
acquaintance
with
the
real
business
of
living
a
familiarity
as
different
as
possible
from
their
theoretical
proficiency
yet
it
seemed
to
darrow
that
her
experience
had
made
her
free
without
hardness
and
without
assertiveness
the
rush
into
amiens
and
the
flash
of
the
station
lights
into
their
compartment
broke
miss
viner
s
sleep
and
without
changing
her
position
she
lifted
her
lids
and
looked
at
darrow
there
was
neither
surprise
nor
bewilderment
in
the
look
she
seemed
instantly
conscious
not
so
much
of
where
she
was
as
of
the
fact
that
she
was
with
him
and
that
fact
seemed
enough
to
reassure
her
she
did
not
even
turn
her
head
to
look
out
her
eyes
continued
to
rest
on
him
with
a
vague
smile
which
appeared
to
light
her
face
from
within
while
her
lips
kept
their
sleepy
droop
shouts
and
the
hurried
tread
of
travellers
came
to
them
through
the
confusing
of
the
platform
a
head
appeared
at
the
window
and
darrow
threw
himself
forward
to
defend
their
solitude
but
the
intruder
was
only
a
train
hand
going
his
round
of
inspection
he
passed
on
and
the
lights
and
cries
of
the
station
dropped
away
merged
in
a
wider
haze
and
a
hollower
resonance
as
the
train
gathered
itself
up
with
a
long
shake
and
rolled
out
again
into
the
darkness
miss
viner
s
head
sank
back
against
the
cushion
pushing
out
a
dusky
wave
of
hair
above
her
forehead
the
swaying
of
the
train
loosened
a
lock
over
her
ear
and
she
shook
it
back
with
a
movement
like
a
boy
s
while
her
gaze
still
rested
on
her
companion
you
re
not
too
tired
she
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
we
shall
be
in
before
midnight
we
re
very
nearly
on
he
verified
the
statement
by
holding
up
his
watch
to
the
lamp
she
nodded
dreamily
it
s
all
right
i
telegraphed
farlow
that
they
mustn
t
think
of
coming
to
the
station
but
they
ll
have
told
the
concierge
to
look
out
for
you
ll
let
me
drive
you
there
she
nodded
again
and
her
eyes
closed
it
was
very
pleasant
to
darrow
that
she
made
no
effort
to
talk
or
to
dissemble
her
sleepiness
he
sat
watching
her
till
the
upper
lashes
met
and
mingled
with
the
lower
and
their
blent
shadow
lay
on
her
cheek
then
he
stood
up
and
drew
the
curtain
over
the
lamp
drowning
the
compartment
in
a
bluish
twilight
as
he
sank
back
into
his
seat
he
thought
how
differently
anna
summers
or
even
anna
leath
would
have
behaved
she
would
not
have
talked
too
much
she
would
not
have
been
either
restless
or
embarrassed
but
her
adaptability
her
appropriateness
would
not
have
been
nature
but
the
oddness
of
the
situation
would
have
made
sleep
impossible
or
if
weariness
had
overcome
her
for
a
moment
she
would
have
waked
with
a
start
wondering
where
she
was
and
how
she
had
come
there
and
if
her
hair
were
tidy
and
nothing
short
of
hairpins
and
a
glass
would
have
restored
her
the
reflection
set
him
wondering
whether
the
sheltered
girl
s
might
not
unfit
her
for
all
subsequent
contact
with
life
how
much
nearer
to
it
had
leath
been
brought
by
marriage
and
motherhood
and
the
passage
of
fourteen
years
what
were
all
her
reticences
and
evasions
but
the
result
of
the
deadening
process
of
forming
a
lady
the
freshness
he
had
marvelled
at
was
like
the
unnatural
whiteness
of
flowers
forced
in
the
dark
as
he
looked
back
at
their
few
days
together
he
saw
that
their
intercourse
had
been
marked
on
her
part
by
the
same
hesitations
and
reserves
which
had
chilled
their
earlier
intimacy
once
more
they
had
had
their
hour
together
and
she
had
wasted
it
as
in
her
girlhood
her
eyes
had
made
promises
which
her
lips
were
afraid
to
keep
she
was
still
afraid
of
life
of
its
ruthlessness
its
danger
and
mystery
she
was
still
the
petted
little
girl
who
can
not
be
left
alone
in
the
dark
his
memory
flew
back
to
their
youthful
story
and
details
took
shape
before
him
how
frail
and
faint
the
picture
was
they
seemed
he
and
she
like
the
ghostly
lovers
of
the
grecian
urn
forever
pursuing
without
ever
clasping
each
other
to
this
day
he
did
not
quite
know
what
had
parted
them
the
break
had
been
as
fortuitous
as
the
fluttering
apart
of
two
on
a
wave
of
summer
air
the
very
slightness
vagueness
of
the
memory
gave
it
an
added
poignancy
he
felt
the
mystic
pang
of
the
parent
for
a
child
which
has
just
breathed
and
died
why
had
it
happened
thus
when
the
least
shifting
of
influences
might
have
made
it
all
so
different
if
she
had
been
given
to
him
then
he
would
have
put
warmth
in
her
veins
and
light
in
her
eyes
would
have
made
her
a
woman
through
and
through
musing
thus
he
had
the
sense
of
waste
that
is
the
bitterest
harvest
of
experience
a
love
like
his
might
have
given
her
the
divine
gift
of
and
now
he
saw
her
fated
to
wane
into
old
age
repeating
the
same
gestures
echoing
the
words
she
had
always
heard
and
perhaps
never
guessing
that
just
outside
her
glazed
and
curtained
consciousness
life
rolled
away
a
vast
blackness
starred
with
lights
like
the
night
landscape
beyond
the
windows
of
the
train
the
engine
lowered
its
speed
for
the
passage
through
a
sleeping
station
in
the
light
of
the
platform
lamp
darrow
looked
across
at
his
companion
her
head
had
dropped
toward
one
shoulder
and
her
lips
were
just
far
enough
apart
for
the
reflection
of
the
upper
one
to
deepen
the
colour
of
the
other
the
jolting
of
the
train
had
again
shaken
loose
the
lock
above
her
ear
it
danced
on
her
cheek
like
the
flit
of
a
brown
wing
over
flowers
and
darrow
felt
an
intense
desire
to
lean
forward
and
put
it
back
behind
her
ear
iv
as
their
on
the
way
from
the
gare
du
nord
turned
into
the
central
glitter
of
the
boulevard
darrow
had
bent
over
to
point
out
an
incandescent
threshold
there
above
the
doorway
an
arch
of
flame
flashed
out
the
name
of
a
great
actress
whose
closing
performances
in
a
play
of
unusual
originality
had
been
the
theme
of
long
articles
in
the
paris
papers
which
darrow
had
tossed
into
their
compartment
at
calais
that
s
what
you
must
see
before
you
re
hours
older
the
girl
followed
his
gesture
eagerly
she
was
all
awake
and
alive
now
as
if
the
heady
rumours
of
the
streets
with
their
long
effervescences
of
light
had
passed
into
her
veins
like
wine
cerdine
is
that
where
she
acts
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
straining
back
for
a
glimpse
of
the
sacred
threshold
as
they
flew
past
it
she
sank
into
her
seat
with
a
satisfied
sigh
it
s
delicious
enough
just
to
know
she
s
there
i
ve
never
seen
her
you
know
when
i
was
here
with
mamie
hoke
we
never
went
anywhere
but
to
the
music
halls
because
she
couldn
t
understand
any
french
and
when
i
came
back
afterward
to
the
farlows
i
was
dead
broke
and
couldn
t
afford
the
play
and
neither
could
they
so
the
only
chance
we
had
was
when
friends
of
theirs
invited
us
and
once
it
was
to
see
a
tragedy
by
a
roumanian
lady
and
the
other
time
it
was
for
l
ami
fritz
at
the
darrow
laughed
you
must
do
better
than
that
now
le
vertige
is
a
fine
thing
and
cerdine
gets
some
wonderful
effects
out
of
it
you
must
come
with
me
tomorrow
evening
to
see
it
with
your
friends
of
that
is
he
added
if
there
s
any
sort
of
chance
of
getting
the
flash
of
a
street
lamp
lit
up
her
radiant
face
oh
will
you
really
take
us
what
fun
to
think
that
it
s
tomorrow
already
it
was
wonderfully
pleasant
to
be
able
to
give
such
pleasure
darrow
was
not
rich
but
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
picture
the
state
of
persons
with
tastes
and
perceptions
like
his
own
to
whom
an
evening
at
the
theatre
was
an
unattainable
indulgence
there
floated
through
his
mind
an
answer
of
leath
s
to
his
enquiry
whether
she
had
seen
the
play
in
question
no
i
meant
to
of
course
but
one
is
so
overwhelmed
with
things
in
paris
and
then
i
m
rather
sick
of
cerdine
one
is
always
being
dragged
to
see
that
among
the
people
he
frequented
was
the
usual
attitude
toward
such
opportunities
there
were
too
many
they
were
a
nuisance
one
had
to
defend
one
s
self
he
even
remembered
wondering
at
the
moment
whether
to
a
really
fine
taste
the
exceptional
thing
could
ever
become
indifferent
through
habit
whether
the
appetite
for
beauty
was
so
soon
dulled
that
it
could
be
kept
alive
only
by
privation
here
at
any
rate
was
a
fine
chance
to
experiment
with
such
a
hunger
he
almost
wished
he
might
stay
on
in
paris
long
enough
to
take
the
measure
of
miss
viner
s
receptivity
she
was
still
dwelling
on
his
promise
it
s
too
beautiful
of
you
oh
don
t
you
think
you
ll
be
able
to
get
seats
and
then
after
a
pause
of
brimming
appreciation
i
wonder
if
you
ll
think
me
horrid
but
it
may
be
my
only
chance
and
if
you
can
t
get
places
for
us
all
wouldn
t
you
perhaps
just
take
me
after
all
the
farlows
may
have
seen
it
he
had
not
of
course
thought
her
horrid
but
only
the
more
engaging
for
being
so
natural
and
so
unashamed
of
showing
the
frank
greed
of
her
famished
youth
oh
you
shall
go
somehow
he
had
gaily
promised
her
and
she
had
dropped
back
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
as
their
cab
passed
into
the
streets
of
the
farlows
quarter
beyond
the
seine
this
little
passage
came
back
to
him
the
next
morning
as
he
opened
his
hotel
window
on
the
early
roar
of
the
northern
terminus
the
girl
was
there
in
the
room
next
to
him
that
had
been
the
first
point
in
his
waking
consciousness
the
second
was
a
sense
of
relief
at
the
obligation
imposed
on
him
by
this
unexpected
turn
of
everts
to
wake
to
the
necessity
of
action
to
postpone
perforce
the
fruitless
contemplation
of
his
private
grievance
was
cause
enough
for
gratitude
even
if
the
small
adventure
in
which
he
found
himself
involved
had
not
on
its
own
merits
roused
an
instinctive
curiosity
to
see
it
through
when
he
and
his
companion
the
night
before
had
reached
the
farlows
door
in
the
rue
de
la
chaise
it
was
only
to
find
after
repeated
assaults
on
its
panels
that
the
farlows
were
no
longer
there
they
had
moved
away
the
week
before
not
only
from
their
apartment
but
from
paris
and
miss
viner
s
breach
with
murrett
had
been
too
sudden
to
permit
her
letter
and
telegram
to
overtake
them
both
communications
no
doubt
still
reposed
in
a
of
the
loge
but
its
custodian
when
drawn
from
his
lair
sulkily
declined
to
let
miss
viner
verify
the
fact
and
only
flung
out
in
return
for
darrow
s
bribe
the
statement
that
the
americans
had
gone
to
joigny
to
pursue
them
there
at
that
hour
was
manifestly
impossible
and
miss
viner
disturbed
but
not
disconcerted
by
this
new
obstacle
had
quite
simply
acceded
to
darrow
s
suggestion
that
she
should
return
for
what
remained
of
the
night
to
the
hotel
where
he
had
sent
his
luggage
the
drive
back
through
the
dark
hush
before
dawn
with
the
nocturnal
blaze
of
the
boulevard
fading
around
them
like
the
false
lights
of
a
magician
s
palace
had
so
played
on
her
impressionability
that
she
seemed
to
give
no
farther
thought
to
her
own
predicament
darrow
noticed
that
she
did
not
feel
the
beauty
and
mystery
of
the
spectacle
as
much
as
its
pressure
of
human
significance
all
its
hidden
implications
of
emotion
and
adventure
as
they
passed
the
shadowy
colonnade
of
the
francais
remote
and
in
the
paling
lights
he
felt
a
clutch
on
his
arm
and
heard
the
cry
there
are
things
there
that
i
want
so
desperately
to
see
and
all
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
she
continued
to
question
him
with
shrewd
precision
and
an
artless
thirst
for
detail
about
the
theatrical
life
of
paris
he
was
struck
afresh
as
he
listened
by
the
way
in
which
her
naturalness
eased
the
situation
of
constraint
leaving
to
it
only
a
pleasant
savour
of
good
fellowship
it
was
the
kind
of
episode
that
one
might
in
advance
have
characterized
as
awkward
yet
that
was
proving
in
the
event
as
much
outside
such
definitions
as
a
sunrise
stroll
with
a
dryad
in
a
forest
and
darrow
reflected
that
mankind
would
never
have
needed
to
invent
tact
if
it
had
not
first
invented
social
complications
it
had
been
understood
with
his
to
miss
viner
that
the
next
morning
he
was
to
look
up
the
joigny
trains
and
see
her
safely
to
the
station
but
while
he
breakfasted
and
waited
for
a
he
recalled
again
her
cry
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
cerdine
it
was
certainly
a
pity
since
that
most
elusive
and
incalculable
of
artists
was
leaving
the
next
week
for
south
america
to
miss
what
might
be
a
last
sight
of
her
in
her
greatest
part
and
darrow
having
dressed
and
made
the
requisite
excerpts
from
the
decided
to
carry
the
result
of
his
deliberations
to
his
neighbour
s
door
it
instantly
opened
at
his
knock
and
she
came
forth
looking
as
if
she
had
been
plunged
into
some
sparkling
element
which
had
curled
up
all
her
drooping
tendrils
and
wrapped
her
in
a
shimmer
of
fresh
leaves
well
what
do
you
think
of
me
she
cried
and
with
a
hand
at
her
waist
she
spun
about
as
if
to
show
off
some
miracle
of
parisian
i
think
the
missing
trunk
has
come
and
that
it
was
worth
waiting
for
you
do
like
my
dress
i
adore
it
i
always
adore
new
dresses
why
you
don
t
mean
to
say
it
s
not
a
new
one
she
laughed
out
her
triumph
no
no
no
my
trunk
hasn
t
come
and
this
is
only
my
old
rag
of
yesterday
but
i
never
knew
the
trick
to
fail
and
as
he
stared
you
see
she
joyously
explained
i
ve
always
had
to
dress
in
all
kinds
of
dreary
and
sometimes
when
everybody
else
was
smart
and
new
it
used
to
make
me
awfully
miserable
so
one
day
when
murrett
dragged
me
down
unexpectedly
to
fill
a
place
at
dinner
i
suddenly
thought
i
d
try
spinning
around
like
that
and
say
to
every
one
well
what
do
you
think
of
me
and
do
you
know
they
were
all
taken
in
including
murrett
who
didn
t
recognize
my
old
turned
and
dyed
rags
and
told
me
afterward
it
was
awfully
bad
form
to
dress
as
if
i
were
somebody
that
people
would
expect
to
know
and
ever
since
whenever
i
ve
particularly
wanted
to
look
nice
i
ve
just
asked
people
what
they
thought
of
my
new
frock
and
they
re
always
always
taken
in
she
dramatized
her
explanation
so
vividly
that
darrow
felt
as
if
his
point
were
gained
ah
but
this
confirms
your
vocation
of
course
he
cried
you
must
see
cerdine
and
seeing
her
face
fall
at
this
reminder
of
the
change
in
her
prospects
he
hastened
to
set
forth
his
plan
as
he
did
so
he
saw
how
easy
it
was
to
explain
things
to
her
she
would
either
accept
his
suggestion
or
she
would
not
but
at
least
she
would
waste
no
time
in
protestations
and
objections
or
any
vain
sacrifice
to
the
idols
of
conformity
the
conviction
that
one
could
on
any
given
point
almost
predicate
this
of
her
gave
him
the
sense
of
having
advanced
far
enough
in
her
intimacy
to
urge
his
arguments
against
a
hasty
pursuit
of
her
friends
yes
it
would
certainly
be
foolish
she
at
once
agreed
in
the
case
of
such
dear
indefinite
angels
as
the
farlows
to
dash
off
after
them
without
more
positive
proof
that
they
were
established
at
joigny
and
so
established
that
they
could
take
her
in
she
owned
it
was
but
too
probable
that
they
had
gone
there
to
cut
down
and
might
be
doing
so
in
quarters
too
contracted
to
receive
her
and
it
would
be
unfair
on
that
chance
to
impose
herself
on
them
unannounced
the
simplest
way
of
getting
farther
light
on
the
question
would
be
to
go
back
to
the
rue
de
la
chaise
where
at
that
more
conversable
hour
the
concierge
might
be
less
chary
of
detail
and
she
could
decide
on
her
next
step
in
the
light
of
such
facts
as
he
imparted
point
by
point
she
fell
in
with
the
suggestion
recognizing
in
the
light
of
their
unexplained
flight
that
the
farlows
might
indeed
be
in
a
situation
on
which
one
could
not
too
rashly
intrude
her
concern
for
her
friends
seemed
to
have
effaced
all
thought
of
herself
and
this
little
indication
of
character
gave
darrow
a
quite
disproportionate
pleasure
she
agreed
that
it
would
be
well
to
go
at
once
to
the
rue
de
la
chaise
but
met
his
proposal
that
they
should
drive
by
the
declaration
that
it
was
a
waste
not
to
walk
in
paris
so
they
set
off
on
foot
through
the
cheerful
tumult
of
the
streets
the
walk
was
long
enough
for
him
to
learn
many
things
about
her
the
storm
of
the
previous
night
had
cleared
the
air
and
paris
shone
in
morning
beauty
under
a
sky
that
was
all
broad
wet
washes
of
white
and
blue
but
darrow
again
noticed
that
her
visual
sensitiveness
was
less
keen
than
her
feeling
for
what
he
was
sure
the
good
farlows
whom
he
already
seemed
to
know
would
have
called
the
human
she
seemed
hardly
conscious
of
sensations
of
form
and
colour
or
of
any
imaginative
suggestion
and
the
spectacle
before
them
always
in
its
scenic
splendour
so
moving
to
her
companion
broke
up
under
her
scrutiny
into
a
thousand
minor
points
the
things
in
the
shops
the
types
of
character
and
manner
of
occupation
shown
in
the
passing
faces
the
street
signs
the
names
of
the
hotels
they
passed
the
motley
brightness
of
the
the
identity
of
the
churches
and
public
buildings
that
caught
her
eye
but
what
she
liked
best
he
divined
was
the
mere
fact
of
being
free
to
walk
abroad
in
the
bright
air
her
tongue
rattling
on
as
it
pleased
while
her
feet
kept
time
to
the
mighty
orchestration
of
the
city
s
sounds
her
delight
in
the
fresh
air
in
the
freedom
light
and
sparkle
of
the
morning
gave
him
a
sudden
insight
into
her
stifled
past
nor
was
it
indifferent
to
him
to
perceive
how
much
his
presence
evidently
added
to
her
enjoyment
if
only
as
a
sympathetic
ear
he
guessed
what
he
must
be
worth
to
her
the
girl
had
been
dying
for
some
one
to
talk
to
some
one
before
whom
she
could
unfold
and
shake
out
to
the
light
her
poor
little
emotions
years
of
repression
were
revealed
in
her
sudden
burst
of
confidence
and
the
pity
she
inspired
made
darrow
long
to
fill
her
few
free
hours
to
the
brim
she
had
the
gift
of
rapid
definition
and
his
questions
as
to
the
life
she
had
led
with
the
farlows
during
the
interregnum
between
the
hoke
and
murrett
eras
called
up
before
him
a
queer
little
corner
of
parisian
existence
the
farlows
themselves
he
a
painter
she
a
magazine
writer
rose
before
him
in
all
their
incorruptible
simplicity
an
elderly
new
england
couple
with
vague
yearnings
for
enfranchisement
who
lived
in
paris
as
if
it
were
a
massachusetts
suburb
and
dwelt
hopefully
on
the
higher
side
of
the
gallic
nature
with
equal
vividness
she
set
before
him
the
component
figures
of
the
circle
from
which
farlow
drew
the
inner
glimpses
of
french
life
appearing
over
her
name
in
a
leading
new
england
journal
the
roumanian
lady
who
had
sent
them
tickets
for
her
tragedy
an
elderly
french
gentleman
who
on
the
strength
of
a
week
s
stay
at
folkestone
translated
english
fiction
for
the
provincial
press
a
lady
from
wichita
kansas
who
advocated
free
love
and
the
abolition
of
the
corset
a
clergyman
s
widow
from
torquay
who
had
written
an
english
ladies
guide
to
foreign
galleries
and
a
russian
sculptor
who
lived
on
nuts
and
was
almost
certainly
an
anarchist
it
was
this
nucleus
and
its
outer
ring
of
musical
architectural
and
other
american
students
which
posed
successively
to
farlow
s
versatile
fancy
as
a
centre
of
university
life
a
salon
of
the
faubourg
germain
a
group
of
parisian
intellectuals
or
a
of
montmartre
but
even
her
faculty
for
extracting
from
it
the
most
varied
literary
effects
had
not
sufficed
to
create
a
permanent
demand
for
the
inner
glimpses
and
there
were
days
when
farlow
s
landscapes
being
equally
unmarketable
a
temporary
withdrawal
to
the
country
subsequently
utilized
as
peeps
into
chateau
life
became
necessary
to
the
courageous
couple
five
years
of
murrett
s
world
while
increasing
sophy
s
tenderness
for
the
farlows
had
left
her
with
few
illusions
as
to
their
power
of
advancing
her
fortunes
and
she
did
not
conceal
from
darrow
that
her
theatrical
projects
were
of
the
vaguest
they
hung
mainly
on
the
problematical
of
an
ancient
comedienne
with
whom
farlow
had
a
slight
acquaintance
extensively
utilized
in
stars
of
the
french
footlights
and
behind
the
scenes
at
the
francais
and
who
had
once
with
signs
of
approval
heard
miss
viner
recite
the
nuit
de
mai
but
of
course
i
know
how
much
that
s
worth
the
girl
broke
off
with
one
of
her
flashes
of
shrewdness
and
besides
it
isn
t
likely
that
a
poor
old
fossil
like
mme
dolle
could
get
anybody
to
listen
to
her
now
even
if
she
really
thought
i
had
talent
but
she
might
introduce
me
to
people
or
at
least
give
me
a
few
tips
if
i
could
manage
to
earn
enough
to
pay
for
lessons
i
d
go
straight
to
some
of
the
big
people
and
work
with
them
i
m
rather
hoping
the
farlows
may
find
me
a
chance
of
that
kind
an
engagement
with
some
american
family
in
paris
who
would
want
to
be
gone
round
with
like
the
hokes
and
who
d
leave
me
time
enough
to
in
the
rue
de
la
chaise
they
learned
little
except
the
exact
address
of
the
farlows
and
the
fact
that
they
had
their
flat
before
leaving
this
information
obtained
darrow
proposed
to
miss
viner
that
they
should
stroll
along
the
quays
to
a
little
restaurant
looking
out
on
the
seine
and
there
over
the
plat
du
jour
consider
the
next
step
to
be
taken
the
long
walk
had
given
her
cheeks
a
glow
indicative
of
wholesome
hunger
and
she
made
no
difficulty
about
satisfying
it
in
darrow
s
company
regaining
the
river
they
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
notre
dame
delayed
now
and
again
by
the
young
man
s
irresistible
tendency
to
linger
over
the
bookstalls
and
by
his
response
to
the
shifting
beauties
of
the
scene
for
two
years
his
eyes
had
been
subdued
to
the
atmospheric
effects
of
london
to
the
mysterious
fusion
of
city
and
bituminous
sky
and
the
transparency
of
the
french
air
which
left
the
green
gardens
and
silvery
stones
so
classically
clear
yet
so
softly
harmonized
struck
him
as
having
a
kind
of
conscious
intelligence
every
line
of
the
architecture
every
arch
of
the
bridges
the
very
sweep
of
the
strong
bright
river
between
them
while
contributing
to
this
effect
sent
forth
each
a
separate
appeal
to
some
sensitive
memory
so
that
for
darrow
a
walk
through
the
paris
streets
was
always
like
the
unrolling
of
a
vast
tapestry
from
which
countless
stored
fragrances
were
shaken
out
it
was
a
proof
of
the
richness
and
multiplicity
of
the
spectacle
that
it
served
without
incongruity
for
so
different
a
purpose
as
the
background
of
miss
viner
s
enjoyment
as
a
mere
for
her
personal
adventure
it
was
just
as
much
in
its
place
as
in
the
evocation
of
great
perspectives
of
feeling
for
her
as
he
again
perceived
when
they
were
seated
at
their
table
in
a
low
window
above
the
seine
paris
was
paris
by
virtue
of
all
its
entertaining
details
its
endless
ingenuities
of
pleasantness
where
else
for
instance
could
one
find
the
dear
little
dishes
of
hors
d
oeuvre
the
anchovies
and
radishes
the
thin
golden
shells
of
butter
or
the
wood
strawberries
and
brown
jars
of
cream
that
gave
to
their
repast
the
last
refinement
of
rusticity
hadn
t
he
noticed
she
asked
that
cooking
always
expressed
the
national
character
and
that
french
food
was
clever
and
amusing
just
because
the
people
were
and
in
private
houses
everywhere
how
the
dishes
always
resembled
the
talk
how
the
very
same
platitudes
seemed
to
go
into
people
s
mouths
and
come
out
of
them
couldn
t
he
see
just
what
kind
of
menu
it
would
make
if
a
fairy
waved
a
wand
and
suddenly
turned
the
conversation
at
a
london
dinner
into
joints
and
puddings
she
always
thought
it
a
good
sign
when
people
liked
irish
stew
it
meant
that
they
enjoyed
changes
and
surprises
and
taking
life
as
it
came
and
such
a
beautiful
parisian
version
of
the
dish
as
the
navarin
that
was
just
being
set
before
them
was
like
the
very
best
kind
of
talk
the
kind
when
one
could
never
tell
just
what
was
going
to
be
said
darrow
as
he
watched
her
enjoyment
of
their
innocent
feast
wondered
if
her
vividness
and
vivacity
were
signs
of
her
calling
she
was
the
kind
of
girl
in
whom
certain
people
would
instantly
have
recognized
the
histrionic
gift
but
experience
had
led
him
to
think
that
except
at
the
creative
moment
the
divine
flame
burns
low
in
its
possessors
the
one
or
two
really
intelligent
actresses
he
had
known
had
struck
him
in
conversation
as
either
bovine
or
primitively
jolly
he
had
a
notion
that
save
in
the
mind
of
genius
the
creative
process
absorbs
too
much
of
the
whole
stuff
of
being
to
leave
much
surplus
for
personal
expression
and
the
girl
before
him
with
her
changing
face
and
flexible
fancies
seemed
destined
to
work
in
life
itself
rather
than
in
any
of
its
counterfeits
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
were
already
on
the
table
when
her
mind
suddenly
sprang
back
to
the
farlows
she
jumped
up
with
one
of
her
subversive
movements
and
declared
that
she
must
telegraph
at
once
darrow
called
for
writing
materials
and
room
was
made
at
her
elbow
for
the
parched
and
saturated
blotter
of
the
parisian
restaurant
but
the
mere
sight
of
these
jaded
implements
seemed
to
paralyze
miss
viner
s
faculties
she
hung
over
the
with
brow
the
tip
of
the
pressed
against
her
lip
and
at
length
she
raised
her
troubled
eyes
to
darrow
s
i
simply
can
t
think
how
to
say
what
that
you
re
staying
over
to
see
cerdine
but
am
i
am
i
really
the
joy
of
it
flamed
over
her
face
darrow
looked
at
his
watch
you
could
hardly
get
an
answer
to
your
telegram
in
time
to
take
a
train
to
joigny
this
afternoon
even
if
you
found
your
friends
could
have
she
mused
for
a
moment
tapping
her
lip
with
the
pen
but
i
must
let
them
know
i
m
here
i
must
find
out
as
soon
as
possible
if
they
can
have
she
laid
the
pen
down
despairingly
i
never
could
write
a
telegram
she
sighed
try
a
letter
then
and
tell
them
you
ll
arrive
this
suggestion
produced
immediate
relief
and
she
gave
an
energetic
dab
at
the
but
after
another
interval
of
uncertain
scratching
she
paused
again
oh
it
s
fearful
i
don
t
know
what
on
earth
to
say
i
wouldn
t
for
the
world
have
them
know
how
beastly
murrett
s
darrow
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
answer
it
was
no
business
of
his
after
all
he
lit
a
cigar
and
leaned
back
in
his
seat
letting
his
eyes
take
their
fill
of
indolent
pleasure
in
the
throes
of
invention
she
had
pushed
back
her
hat
loosening
the
stray
lock
which
had
invited
his
touch
the
night
before
after
looking
at
it
for
a
while
he
stood
up
and
wandered
to
the
window
behind
him
he
heard
her
pen
scrape
on
i
don
t
want
to
worry
them
i
m
so
certain
they
ve
got
bothers
of
their
the
faltering
scratches
ceased
again
i
wish
i
weren
t
such
an
idiot
about
writing
all
the
words
get
frightened
and
scurry
away
when
i
try
to
catch
he
glanced
back
at
her
with
a
smile
as
she
bent
above
her
task
like
a
struggling
with
a
her
flushed
cheek
and
frowning
brow
showed
that
her
difficulty
was
genuine
and
not
an
artless
device
to
draw
him
to
her
side
she
was
really
powerless
to
put
her
thoughts
in
writing
and
the
inability
seemed
characteristic
of
her
quick
impressionable
mind
and
of
the
incessant
of
her
sensations
he
thought
of
anna
leath
s
letters
or
rather
of
the
few
he
had
received
years
ago
from
the
girl
who
had
been
anna
summers
he
saw
the
slender
firm
strokes
of
the
pen
recalled
the
clear
structure
of
the
phrases
and
by
an
abrupt
association
of
ideas
remembered
that
at
that
very
hour
just
such
a
document
might
be
awaiting
him
at
the
hotel
what
if
it
were
there
indeed
and
had
brought
him
a
complete
explanation
of
her
telegram
the
revulsion
of
feeling
produced
by
this
thought
made
him
look
at
the
girl
with
sudden
impatience
she
struck
him
as
positively
stupid
and
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
wasted
half
his
day
with
her
when
all
the
while
leath
s
letter
might
be
lying
on
his
table
at
that
moment
if
he
could
have
chosen
he
would
have
left
his
companion
on
the
spot
but
he
had
her
on
his
hands
and
must
accept
the
consequences
some
odd
intuition
seemed
to
make
her
conscious
of
his
change
of
mood
for
she
sprang
from
her
seat
crumpling
the
letter
in
her
hand
i
m
too
stupid
but
i
won
t
keep
you
any
longer
i
ll
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
write
her
colour
deepened
and
for
the
first
time
as
their
eyes
met
he
noticed
a
faint
embarrassment
in
hers
could
it
be
that
his
nearness
was
after
all
the
cause
of
her
confusion
the
thought
turned
his
vague
impatience
with
her
into
a
definite
resentment
toward
himself
there
was
really
no
excuse
for
his
having
blundered
into
such
an
adventure
why
had
he
not
shipped
the
girl
off
to
joigny
by
the
evening
train
instead
of
urging
her
to
delay
and
using
cerdine
as
a
pretext
paris
was
full
of
people
he
knew
and
his
annoyance
was
increased
by
the
thought
that
some
friend
of
leath
s
might
see
him
at
the
play
and
report
his
presence
there
with
a
suspiciously
companion
the
idea
was
distinctly
disagreeable
he
did
not
want
the
woman
he
adored
to
think
he
could
forget
her
for
a
moment
and
by
this
time
he
had
fully
persuaded
himself
that
a
letter
from
her
was
awaiting
him
and
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
imagine
that
its
contents
might
annul
the
writer
s
telegraphed
injunction
and
call
him
to
her
side
at
once
v
at
the
porter
s
desk
a
brief
pas
de
lettres
fell
destructively
on
the
fabric
of
these
hopes
leath
had
not
written
she
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
explain
her
telegram
darrow
turned
away
with
a
sharp
pang
of
humiliation
her
frugal
silence
mocked
his
prodigality
of
hopes
and
fears
he
had
put
his
question
to
the
porter
once
before
on
returning
to
the
hotel
after
luncheon
and
now
coming
back
again
in
the
late
afternoon
he
was
met
by
the
same
denial
the
second
post
was
in
and
had
brought
him
nothing
a
glance
at
his
watch
showed
that
he
had
barely
time
to
dress
before
taking
miss
viner
out
to
dine
but
as
he
turned
to
the
lift
a
new
thought
struck
him
and
hurrying
back
into
the
hall
he
dashed
off
another
telegram
to
his
servant
have
you
forwarded
any
letter
with
french
postmark
today
telegraph
answer
some
kind
of
reply
would
be
certain
to
reach
him
on
his
return
from
the
theatre
and
he
would
then
know
definitely
whether
leath
meant
to
write
or
not
he
hastened
up
to
his
room
and
dressed
with
a
lighter
heart
miss
viner
s
vagrant
trunk
had
finally
found
its
way
to
its
owner
and
clad
in
such
modest
splendour
as
it
furnished
she
shone
at
darrow
across
their
restaurant
table
in
the
reaction
of
his
wounded
vanity
he
found
her
prettier
and
more
interesting
than
before
her
dress
sloping
away
from
the
throat
showed
the
graceful
set
of
her
head
on
its
slender
neck
and
the
wide
brim
of
her
hat
arched
above
her
hair
like
a
dusky
halo
pleasure
danced
in
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
and
as
she
shone
on
him
between
the
darrow
felt
that
he
should
not
be
at
all
sorry
to
be
seen
with
her
in
public
he
even
sent
a
careless
glance
about
him
in
the
vague
hope
that
it
might
fall
on
an
acquaintance
at
the
theatre
her
vivacity
sank
into
a
breathless
hush
and
she
sat
intent
in
her
corner
of
their
baignoire
with
the
gaze
of
a
neophyte
about
to
be
initiated
into
the
sacred
mysteries
darrow
placed
himself
behind
her
that
he
might
catch
her
profile
between
himself
and
the
stage
he
was
touched
by
the
youthful
seriousness
of
her
expression
in
spite
of
the
experiences
she
must
have
had
and
of
the
years
to
which
she
owned
she
struck
him
as
intrinsically
young
and
he
wondered
how
so
evanescent
a
quality
could
have
been
preserved
in
the
desiccating
murrett
air
as
the
play
progressed
he
noticed
that
her
immobility
was
traversed
by
swift
flashes
of
perception
she
was
not
missing
anything
and
her
intensity
of
attention
when
cerdine
was
on
the
stage
drew
an
anxious
line
between
her
brows
after
the
first
act
she
remained
for
a
few
minutes
rapt
and
motionless
then
she
turned
to
her
companion
with
a
quick
patter
of
questions
he
gathered
from
them
that
she
had
been
less
interested
in
following
the
general
drift
of
the
play
than
in
observing
the
details
of
its
interpretation
every
gesture
and
inflection
of
the
great
actress
s
had
been
marked
and
analyzed
and
darrow
felt
a
secret
gratification
in
being
appealed
to
as
an
authority
on
the
histrionic
art
his
interest
in
it
had
hitherto
been
merely
that
of
the
cultivated
young
man
curious
of
all
forms
of
artistic
expression
but
in
reply
to
her
questions
he
found
things
to
say
about
it
which
evidently
struck
his
listener
as
impressive
and
original
and
with
which
he
himself
was
not
on
the
whole
dissatisfied
miss
viner
was
much
more
concerned
to
hear
his
views
than
to
express
her
own
and
the
deference
with
which
she
received
his
comments
called
from
him
more
ideas
about
the
theatre
than
he
had
ever
supposed
himself
to
possess
with
the
second
act
she
began
to
give
more
attention
to
the
development
of
the
play
though
her
interest
was
excited
rather
by
what
she
called
the
story
than
by
the
conflict
of
character
producing
it
oddly
combined
with
her
sharp
apprehension
of
things
theatrical
her
knowledge
of
technical
dodges
and
precedents
her
glibness
about
lines
and
curtains
was
the
primitive
simplicity
of
her
attitude
toward
the
tale
itself
as
toward
something
that
was
really
happening
and
at
which
one
assisted
as
at
a
or
a
quarrel
overheard
in
the
next
room
she
wanted
to
know
if
darrow
thought
the
lovers
really
would
be
involved
in
the
catastrophe
that
threatened
them
and
when
he
reminded
her
that
his
predictions
were
disqualified
by
his
having
already
seen
the
play
she
exclaimed
oh
then
please
don
t
tell
me
what
s
going
to
happen
and
the
next
moment
was
questioning
him
about
cerdine
s
theatrical
situation
and
her
private
history
on
the
latter
point
some
of
her
enquiries
were
of
a
kind
that
it
is
not
in
the
habit
of
young
girls
to
make
or
even
to
know
how
to
make
but
her
apparent
unconsciousness
of
the
fact
seemed
rather
to
reflect
on
her
past
associates
than
on
herself
when
the
second
act
was
over
darrow
suggested
their
taking
a
turn
in
the
foyer
and
seated
on
one
of
its
cramped
red
velvet
sofas
they
watched
the
crowd
surge
up
and
down
in
a
glare
of
lights
and
gilding
then
as
she
complained
of
the
heat
he
led
her
through
the
press
to
the
congested
cafe
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
where
orangeades
were
thrust
at
them
between
the
shoulders
of
packed
consommateurs
and
darrow
lighting
a
cigarette
while
she
sucked
her
straw
knew
the
primitive
complacency
of
the
man
at
whose
companion
other
men
stare
on
a
corner
of
their
table
lay
a
smeared
copy
of
a
theatrical
journal
it
caught
sophy
s
eye
and
after
poring
over
the
page
she
looked
up
with
an
excited
exclamation
they
re
giving
oedipe
tomorrow
afternoon
at
the
francais
i
suppose
you
ve
seen
it
heaps
and
heaps
of
times
he
smiled
back
at
her
you
must
see
it
too
we
ll
go
she
sighed
at
his
suggestion
but
without
discarding
it
how
can
i
the
last
train
for
joigny
leaves
at
but
you
don
t
know
yet
that
your
friends
will
want
i
shall
know
tomorrow
early
i
asked
farlow
to
telegraph
as
soon
as
she
got
my
a
twinge
of
compunction
shot
through
darrow
her
words
recalled
to
him
that
on
their
return
to
the
hotel
after
luncheon
she
had
given
him
her
letter
to
post
and
that
he
had
never
thought
of
it
again
no
doubt
it
was
still
in
the
pocket
of
the
coat
he
had
taken
off
when
he
dressed
for
dinner
in
his
perturbation
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
the
movement
made
her
look
up
at
him
what
s
the
matter
nothing
only
you
know
i
don
t
fancy
that
letter
can
have
caught
this
afternoon
s
not
caught
it
why
not
why
i
m
afraid
it
will
have
been
too
he
bent
his
head
to
light
another
cigarette
she
struck
her
hands
together
with
a
gesture
which
to
his
amusement
he
noticed
she
had
caught
from
cerdine
oh
dear
i
hadn
t
thought
of
that
but
surely
it
will
reach
them
in
the
morning
some
time
in
the
morning
i
suppose
you
know
the
french
provincial
post
is
never
in
a
hurry
i
don
t
believe
your
letter
would
have
been
delivered
this
evening
in
any
as
this
idea
occurred
to
him
he
felt
himself
almost
absolved
perhaps
then
i
ought
to
have
telegraphed
i
ll
telegraph
for
you
in
the
morning
if
you
say
the
bell
announcing
the
close
of
the
entr
shrilled
through
the
cafe
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
come
come
we
mustn
t
miss
it
instantly
forgetful
of
the
farlows
she
slipped
her
arm
through
his
and
turned
to
push
her
way
back
to
the
theatre
as
soon
as
the
curtain
went
up
she
as
promptly
forgot
her
companion
watching
her
from
the
corner
to
which
he
had
returned
darrow
saw
that
great
waves
of
sensation
were
beating
deliciously
against
her
brain
it
was
as
though
every
starved
sensibility
were
throwing
out
feelers
to
the
mounting
tide
as
though
everything
she
was
seeing
hearing
imagining
rushed
in
to
fill
the
void
of
all
she
had
always
been
denied
darrow
as
he
observed
her
again
felt
a
detached
enjoyment
in
her
pleasure
she
was
an
extraordinary
conductor
of
sensation
she
seemed
to
transmit
it
physically
in
emanations
that
set
the
blood
dancing
in
his
veins
he
had
not
often
had
the
opportunity
of
studying
the
effects
of
a
perfectly
fresh
impression
on
so
responsive
a
temperament
and
he
felt
a
fleeting
desire
to
make
its
chords
vibrate
for
his
own
amusement
at
the
end
of
the
next
act
she
discovered
with
dismay
that
in
their
transit
to
the
cafe
she
had
lost
the
beautiful
pictured
programme
he
had
bought
for
her
she
wanted
to
go
back
and
hunt
for
it
but
darrow
assured
her
that
he
would
have
no
trouble
in
getting
her
another
when
he
went
out
in
quest
of
it
she
followed
him
protestingly
to
the
door
of
the
box
and
he
saw
that
she
was
distressed
at
the
thought
of
his
having
to
spend
an
additional
franc
for
her
this
frugality
smote
darrow
by
its
contrast
to
her
natural
bright
profusion
and
again
he
felt
the
desire
to
right
so
clumsy
an
injustice
when
he
returned
to
the
box
she
was
still
standing
in
the
doorway
and
he
noticed
that
his
were
not
the
only
eyes
attracted
to
her
then
another
impression
sharply
diverted
his
attention
above
the
fagged
faces
of
the
parisian
crowd
he
had
caught
the
fresh
fair
countenance
of
owen
leath
signalling
a
joyful
recognition
the
young
man
slim
and
eager
had
detached
himself
from
two
companions
of
his
own
type
and
was
seeking
to
push
through
the
press
to
his
s
friend
the
encounter
to
darrow
could
hardly
have
been
more
inopportune
it
woke
in
him
a
confusion
of
feelings
of
which
only
the
uppermost
was
allayed
by
seeing
sophy
viner
as
if
instinctively
warned
melt
back
into
the
shadow
of
their
box
a
minute
later
owen
leath
was
at
his
side
i
was
sure
it
was
you
such
luck
to
run
across
you
won
t
you
come
off
with
us
to
supper
after
it
s
over
montmartre
or
wherever
else
you
please
those
two
chaps
over
there
are
friends
of
mine
at
the
beaux
arts
both
of
them
rather
good
fellows
and
we
d
be
so
glad
for
half
a
second
darrow
read
in
his
hospitable
eye
the
termination
if
you
d
bring
the
lady
too
then
it
deflected
into
we
d
all
be
so
glad
if
you
d
darrow
excusing
himself
with
thanks
lingered
on
for
a
few
minutes
chat
in
which
every
word
and
every
tone
of
his
companion
s
voice
was
like
a
sharp
light
flashed
into
aching
eyes
he
was
glad
when
the
bell
called
the
audience
to
their
seats
and
young
leath
left
him
with
the
friendly
question
we
ll
see
you
at
givre
later
on
when
he
rejoined
miss
viner
darrow
s
first
care
was
to
find
out
by
a
rapid
inspection
of
the
house
whether
owen
leath
s
seat
had
given
him
a
view
of
their
box
but
the
young
man
was
not
visible
from
it
and
darrow
concluded
that
he
had
been
recognized
in
the
corridor
and
not
at
his
companion
s
side
he
scarcely
knew
why
it
seemed
to
him
so
important
that
this
point
should
be
settled
certainly
his
sense
of
reassurance
was
less
due
to
regard
for
miss
viner
than
to
the
persistent
vision
of
grave
offended
eyes
during
the
drive
back
to
the
hotel
this
vision
was
persistently
kept
before
him
by
the
thought
that
the
evening
post
might
have
brought
a
letter
from
leath
even
if
no
letter
had
yet
come
his
servant
might
have
telegraphed
to
say
that
one
was
on
its
way
and
at
the
thought
his
interest
in
the
girl
at
his
side
again
cooled
to
the
fraternal
the
almost
fatherly
she
was
no
more
to
him
after
all
than
an
appealing
young
creature
to
whom
it
was
mildly
agreeable
to
have
offered
an
evening
s
diversion
and
when
as
they
rolled
into
the
illuminated
court
of
the
hotel
she
turned
with
a
quick
movement
which
brought
her
happy
face
close
to
his
he
leaned
away
affecting
to
be
absorbed
in
opening
the
door
of
the
cab
at
the
desk
the
night
porter
after
a
vain
search
through
the
was
disposed
to
think
that
a
letter
or
telegram
had
in
fact
been
sent
up
for
the
gentleman
and
darrow
at
the
announcement
could
hardly
wait
to
ascend
to
his
room
upstairs
he
and
his
companion
had
the
long
corridor
to
themselves
and
sophy
paused
on
her
threshold
gathering
up
in
one
hand
the
pale
folds
of
her
cloak
while
she
held
the
other
out
to
darrow
if
the
telegram
comes
early
i
shall
be
off
by
the
first
train
so
i
suppose
this
is
she
said
her
eyes
dimmed
by
a
little
shadow
of
regret
darrow
with
a
renewed
start
of
contrition
perceived
that
he
had
again
forgotten
her
letter
and
as
their
hands
met
he
vowed
to
himself
that
the
moment
she
had
left
him
he
would
dash
down
stairs
to
post
it
oh
i
ll
see
you
in
the
morning
of
course
a
tremor
of
pleasure
crossed
her
face
as
he
stood
before
her
smiling
a
little
uncertainly
at
any
rate
she
said
i
want
to
thank
you
now
for
my
good
he
felt
in
her
hand
the
same
tremor
he
had
seen
in
her
face
but
it
s
you
on
the
contrary
he
began
lifting
the
hand
to
his
lips
as
he
dropped
it
and
their
eyes
met
something
passed
through
hers
that
was
like
a
light
carried
rapidly
behind
a
curtained
window
good
night
you
must
be
awfully
tired
he
said
with
a
friendly
abruptness
turning
away
without
even
waiting
to
see
her
pass
into
her
room
he
unlocked
his
door
and
stumbling
over
the
threshold
groped
in
the
darkness
for
the
electric
button
the
light
showed
him
a
telegram
on
the
table
and
he
forgot
everything
else
as
he
caught
it
up
no
letter
from
france
the
message
read
it
fell
from
darrow
s
hand
to
the
floor
and
he
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
table
and
sat
gazing
at
the
dingy
drab
and
olive
pattern
of
the
carpet
she
had
not
written
then
she
had
not
written
and
it
was
manifest
now
that
she
did
not
mean
to
write
if
she
had
had
any
intention
of
explaining
her
telegram
she
would
certainly
within
hours
have
followed
it
up
by
a
letter
but
she
evidently
did
not
intend
to
explain
it
and
her
silence
could
mean
only
that
she
had
no
explanation
to
give
or
else
that
she
was
too
indifferent
to
be
aware
that
one
was
needed
darrow
face
to
face
with
these
alternatives
felt
a
recrudescence
of
boyish
misery
it
was
no
longer
his
hurt
vanity
that
cried
out
he
told
himself
that
he
could
have
borne
an
equal
amount
of
pain
if
only
it
had
left
leath
s
image
untouched
but
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
as
trivial
or
insincere
the
thought
was
so
intolerable
that
he
felt
a
blind
desire
to
punish
some
one
else
for
the
pain
it
caused
him
as
he
sat
moodily
staring
at
the
carpet
its
silly
intricacies
melted
into
a
blur
from
which
the
eyes
of
leath
again
looked
out
at
him
he
saw
the
fine
sweep
of
her
brows
and
the
deep
look
beneath
them
as
she
had
turned
from
him
on
their
last
evening
in
london
this
will
be
then
she
had
said
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
her
parting
phrase
had
been
the
same
as
sophy
viner
s
at
the
thought
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
took
down
from
its
hook
the
coat
in
which
he
had
left
miss
viner
s
letter
the
clock
marked
the
third
quarter
after
midnight
and
he
knew
it
would
make
no
difference
if
he
went
down
to
the
now
or
early
the
next
morning
but
he
wanted
to
clear
his
conscience
and
having
found
the
letter
he
went
to
the
door
a
sound
in
the
next
room
made
him
pause
he
had
become
conscious
again
that
a
few
feet
off
on
the
other
side
of
a
thin
partition
a
small
keen
flame
of
life
was
quivering
and
agitating
the
air
sophy
s
face
came
back
to
him
insistently
it
was
as
vivid
now
as
leath
s
had
been
a
moment
earlier
he
recalled
with
a
faint
smile
of
retrospective
pleasure
the
girl
s
enjoyment
of
her
evening
and
the
innumerable
fine
feelers
of
sensation
she
had
thrown
out
to
its
impressions
it
gave
him
a
curiously
close
sense
of
her
presence
to
think
that
at
that
moment
she
was
living
over
her
enjoyment
as
intensely
as
he
was
living
over
his
unhappiness
his
own
case
was
irremediable
but
it
was
easy
enough
to
give
her
a
few
more
hours
of
pleasure
and
did
she
not
perhaps
secretly
expect
it
of
him
after
all
if
she
had
been
very
anxious
to
join
her
friends
she
would
have
telegraphed
them
on
reaching
paris
instead
of
writing
he
wondered
now
that
he
had
not
been
struck
at
the
moment
by
so
artless
a
device
to
gain
more
time
the
fact
of
her
having
practised
it
did
not
make
him
think
less
well
of
her
it
merely
strengthened
the
impulse
to
use
his
opportunity
she
was
starving
poor
child
for
a
little
amusement
a
little
personal
life
why
not
give
her
the
chance
of
another
day
in
paris
if
he
did
so
should
he
not
be
merely
falling
in
with
her
own
hopes
at
the
thought
his
sympathy
for
her
revived
she
became
of
absorbing
interest
to
him
as
an
escape
from
himself
and
an
object
about
which
his
thwarted
activities
could
cluster
he
felt
less
drearily
alone
because
of
her
being
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
in
his
gratitude
to
her
for
giving
him
this
relief
he
began
with
indolent
amusement
to
plan
new
ways
of
detaining
her
he
dropped
back
into
his
chair
lit
a
cigar
and
smiled
a
little
at
the
image
of
her
smiling
face
he
tried
to
imagine
what
incident
of
the
day
she
was
likely
to
be
recalling
at
that
particular
moment
and
what
part
he
probably
played
in
it
that
it
was
not
a
small
part
he
was
certain
and
the
knowledge
was
undeniably
pleasant
now
and
then
a
sound
from
her
room
brought
before
him
more
vividly
the
reality
of
the
situation
and
the
strangeness
of
the
vast
swarming
solitude
in
which
he
and
she
were
momentarily
isolated
amid
long
lines
of
rooms
each
holding
its
separate
secret
the
nearness
of
all
these
other
mysteries
enclosing
theirs
gave
darrow
a
more
intimate
sense
of
the
girl
s
presence
and
through
the
fumes
of
his
cigar
his
imagination
continued
to
follow
her
to
and
fro
traced
the
curve
of
her
slim
young
arms
as
she
raised
them
to
undo
her
hair
pictured
the
sliding
down
of
her
dress
to
the
waist
and
then
to
the
knees
and
the
whiteness
of
her
feet
as
she
slipped
across
the
floor
to
bed
he
stood
up
and
shook
himself
with
a
yawn
throwing
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
his
glance
in
following
it
lit
on
the
telegram
which
had
dropped
to
the
floor
the
sounds
in
the
next
room
had
ceased
and
once
more
he
felt
alone
and
unhappy
opening
the
window
he
folded
his
arms
on
the
sill
and
looked
out
on
the
vast
mass
of
the
city
and
then
up
at
the
dark
sky
in
which
the
morning
planet
stood
vi
at
the
theatre
francais
the
next
afternoon
darrow
yawned
and
fidgeted
in
his
seat
the
day
was
warm
the
theatre
crowded
and
airless
and
the
performance
it
seemed
to
him
intolerably
bad
he
stole
a
glance
at
his
companion
wondering
if
she
shared
his
feelings
her
rapt
profile
betrayed
no
unrest
but
politeness
might
have
caused
her
to
feign
an
interest
that
she
did
not
feel
he
leaned
back
impatiently
stifling
another
yawn
and
trying
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
stage
great
things
were
going
forward
there
and
he
was
not
insensible
to
the
stern
beauties
of
the
ancient
drama
but
the
interpretation
of
the
play
seemed
to
him
as
airless
and
lifeless
as
the
atmosphere
of
the
theatre
the
players
were
the
same
whom
he
had
often
applauded
in
those
very
parts
and
perhaps
that
fact
added
to
the
impression
of
staleness
and
conventionality
produced
by
their
performance
surely
it
was
time
to
infuse
new
blood
into
the
veins
of
the
moribund
art
he
had
the
impression
that
the
ghosts
of
actors
were
giving
a
spectral
performance
on
the
shores
of
styx
certainly
it
was
not
the
most
profitable
way
for
a
young
man
with
a
pretty
companion
to
pass
the
golden
hours
of
a
spring
afternoon
the
freshness
of
the
face
at
his
side
reflecting
the
freshness
of
the
season
suggested
dapplings
of
sunlight
through
new
leaves
the
sound
of
a
brook
in
the
grass
the
ripple
of
over
breezy
meadows
when
at
length
the
fateful
march
of
the
cothurns
was
stayed
by
the
single
pause
in
the
play
and
darrow
had
led
miss
viner
out
on
the
balcony
overhanging
the
square
before
the
theatre
he
turned
to
see
if
she
shared
his
feelings
but
the
rapturous
look
she
gave
him
checked
the
depreciation
on
his
lips
oh
why
did
you
bring
me
out
here
one
ought
to
creep
away
and
sit
in
the
dark
till
it
begins
again
is
that
the
way
they
made
you
feel
didn
t
they
as
if
the
gods
were
there
all
the
while
just
behind
them
pulling
the
strings
her
hands
were
pressed
against
the
railing
her
face
shining
and
darkening
under
the
of
successive
impressions
darrow
smiled
in
enjoyment
of
her
pleasure
after
all
he
had
felt
all
that
long
ago
perhaps
it
was
his
own
fault
rather
than
that
of
the
actors
that
the
poetry
of
the
play
seemed
to
have
evaporated
but
no
he
had
been
right
in
judging
the
performance
to
be
dull
and
stale
it
was
simply
his
companion
s
inexperience
her
lack
of
occasions
to
compare
and
estimate
that
made
her
think
it
brilliant
i
was
afraid
you
were
bored
and
wanted
to
come
bored
she
made
a
little
aggrieved
grimace
you
mean
you
thought
me
too
ignorant
and
stupid
to
appreciate
it
no
not
the
hand
nearest
him
still
lay
on
the
railing
of
the
balcony
and
he
covered
it
for
a
moment
with
his
as
he
did
so
he
saw
the
colour
rise
and
tremble
in
her
cheek
tell
me
just
what
you
think
he
said
bending
his
head
a
little
and
only
of
his
words
she
did
not
turn
her
face
to
his
but
began
to
talk
rapidly
trying
to
convey
something
of
what
she
felt
but
she
was
evidently
unused
to
analyzing
her
aesthetic
emotions
and
the
tumultuous
rush
of
the
drama
seemed
to
have
left
her
in
a
state
of
panting
wonder
as
though
it
had
been
a
storm
or
some
other
natural
cataclysm
she
had
no
literary
or
historic
associations
to
which
to
attach
her
impressions
her
education
had
evidently
not
comprised
a
course
in
greek
literature
but
she
felt
what
would
probably
have
been
unperceived
by
many
a
young
lady
who
had
taken
a
first
in
classics
the
ineluctable
fatality
of
the
tale
the
dread
sway
in
it
of
the
same
mysterious
luck
which
pulled
the
threads
of
her
own
small
destiny
it
was
not
literature
to
her
it
was
fact
as
actual
as
near
by
as
what
was
happening
to
her
at
the
moment
and
what
the
next
hour
held
in
store
seen
in
this
light
the
play
regained
for
darrow
its
supreme
and
poignant
reality
he
pierced
to
the
heart
of
its
significance
through
all
the
artificial
accretions
with
which
his
theories
of
art
and
the
conventions
of
the
stage
had
clothed
it
and
saw
it
as
he
had
never
seen
it
as
life
after
this
there
could
be
no
question
of
flight
and
he
took
her
back
to
the
theatre
content
to
receive
his
own
sensations
through
the
medium
of
hers
but
with
the
continuation
of
the
play
and
the
oppression
of
the
heavy
air
his
attention
again
began
to
wander
straying
back
over
the
incidents
of
the
morning
he
had
been
with
sophy
viner
all
day
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
quickly
the
time
had
gone
she
had
hardly
attempted
as
the
hours
passed
to
conceal
her
satisfaction
on
finding
that
no
telegram
came
from
the
farlows
they
ll
have
written
she
had
simply
said
and
her
mind
had
at
once
flown
on
to
the
golden
prospect
of
an
afternoon
at
the
theatre
the
intervening
hours
had
been
disposed
of
in
a
stroll
through
the
lively
streets
and
a
repast
luxuriously
lingered
over
under
the
of
a
restaurant
in
the
champs
elysees
everything
entertained
and
interested
her
and
darrow
remarked
with
an
amused
detachment
that
she
was
not
insensible
to
the
impression
her
charms
produced
yet
there
was
no
hard
edge
of
vanity
in
her
sense
of
her
prettiness
she
seemed
simply
to
be
aware
of
it
as
a
note
in
the
general
harmony
and
to
enjoy
sounding
the
note
as
a
singer
enjoys
singing
after
luncheon
as
they
sat
over
their
coffee
she
had
again
asked
an
immense
number
of
questions
and
delivered
herself
of
a
remarkable
variety
of
opinions
her
questions
testified
to
a
wholesome
and
comprehensive
human
curiosity
and
her
comments
showed
like
her
face
and
her
whole
attitude
an
odd
mingling
of
precocious
wisdom
and
disarming
ignorance
when
she
talked
to
him
about
life
the
word
was
often
on
her
lips
she
seemed
to
him
like
a
child
playing
with
a
tiger
s
cub
and
he
said
to
himself
that
some
day
the
child
would
grow
up
and
so
would
the
tiger
meanwhile
such
expertness
qualified
by
such
candour
made
it
impossible
to
guess
the
extent
of
her
personal
experience
or
to
estimate
its
effect
on
her
character
she
might
be
any
one
of
a
dozen
definable
types
or
she
might
more
disconcertingly
to
her
companion
and
more
perilously
to
herself
be
a
shifting
and
uncrystallized
mixture
of
them
all
her
talk
as
usual
had
promptly
reverted
to
the
stage
she
was
eager
to
learn
about
every
form
of
dramatic
expression
which
the
metropolis
of
things
theatrical
had
to
offer
and
her
curiosity
ranged
from
the
official
temples
of
the
art
to
its
less
hallowed
haunts
her
searching
enquiries
about
a
play
whose
production
on
one
of
the
latter
scenes
had
provoked
a
considerable
amount
of
scandal
led
darrow
to
throw
out
laughingly
to
see
that
you
ll
have
to
wait
till
you
re
married
and
his
answer
had
sent
her
off
at
a
tangent
oh
i
never
mean
to
marry
she
had
rejoined
in
a
tone
of
youthful
finality
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
before
yes
from
girls
who
ve
only
got
to
choose
her
eyes
had
grown
suddenly
almost
old
i
d
like
you
to
see
the
only
men
who
ve
ever
wanted
to
marry
me
one
was
the
doctor
on
the
steamer
when
i
came
abroad
with
the
hokes
he
d
been
cashiered
from
the
navy
for
drunkenness
the
other
was
a
deaf
widower
with
three
daughters
who
kept
a
in
bayswater
besides
she
rambled
on
i
m
not
so
sure
that
i
believe
in
marriage
you
see
i
m
all
for
and
the
chance
to
live
one
s
life
i
m
awfully
modern
you
it
was
just
when
she
proclaimed
herself
most
awfully
modern
that
she
struck
him
as
most
helplessly
backward
yet
the
moment
after
without
any
bravado
or
apparent
desire
to
assume
an
attitude
she
would
propound
some
social
axiom
which
could
have
been
gathered
only
in
the
bitter
soil
of
experience
all
these
things
came
back
to
him
as
he
sat
beside
her
in
the
theatre
and
watched
her
ingenuous
absorption
it
was
on
the
story
that
her
mind
was
fixed
and
in
life
also
he
suspected
it
would
always
be
the
story
rather
than
its
remoter
imaginative
issues
that
would
hold
her
he
did
not
believe
there
were
ever
any
echoes
in
her
soul
there
was
no
question
however
that
what
she
felt
was
felt
with
intensity
to
the
actual
the
immediate
she
spread
vibrating
strings
when
the
play
was
over
and
they
came
out
once
more
into
the
sunlight
darrow
looked
down
at
her
with
a
smile
well
he
asked
she
made
no
answer
her
dark
gaze
seemed
to
rest
on
him
without
seeing
him
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
pale
and
the
loose
hair
under
her
clung
to
her
forehead
in
damp
rings
she
looked
like
a
young
priestess
still
dazed
by
the
fumes
of
the
cavern
you
poor
child
it
s
been
almost
too
much
for
you
she
shook
her
head
with
a
vague
smile
come
he
went
on
putting
his
hand
on
her
arm
let
s
jump
into
a
taxi
and
get
some
air
and
sunshine
look
there
are
hours
of
daylight
left
and
see
what
a
night
it
s
going
to
be
he
pointed
over
their
heads
to
where
a
white
moon
hung
in
the
misty
blue
above
the
roofs
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
she
made
no
answer
and
he
signed
to
a
calling
out
to
the
driver
to
the
bois
as
the
carriage
turned
toward
the
tuileries
she
roused
herself
i
must
go
first
to
the
hotel
there
may
be
a
message
at
any
rate
i
must
decide
on
darrow
saw
that
the
reality
of
the
situation
had
suddenly
forced
itself
upon
her
i
must
decide
on
something
she
repeated
he
would
have
liked
to
postpone
the
return
to
persuade
her
to
drive
directly
to
the
bois
for
dinner
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
remind
her
that
she
could
not
start
for
joigny
that
evening
and
that
therefore
it
was
of
no
moment
whether
she
received
the
farlows
answer
then
or
a
few
hours
later
but
for
some
reason
he
hesitated
to
use
this
argument
which
had
come
so
naturally
to
him
the
day
before
after
all
he
knew
she
would
find
nothing
at
the
hotel
so
what
did
it
matter
if
they
went
there
the
porter
interrogated
was
not
sure
he
himself
had
received
nothing
for
the
lady
but
in
his
absence
his
subordinate
might
have
sent
a
letter
upstairs
darrow
and
sophy
mounted
together
in
the
lift
and
the
young
man
while
she
went
into
her
room
unlocked
his
own
door
and
glanced
at
the
empty
table
for
him
at
least
no
message
had
come
and
on
her
threshold
a
moment
later
she
met
him
with
the
expected
no
there
s
nothing
he
feigned
an
unregretful
surprise
so
much
the
better
and
now
shall
we
drive
out
somewhere
or
would
you
rather
take
a
boat
to
bellevue
have
you
ever
dined
there
on
the
terrace
by
moonlight
it
s
not
at
all
bad
and
there
s
no
earthly
use
in
sitting
here
she
stood
before
him
in
perplexity
but
when
i
wrote
yesterday
i
asked
them
to
telegraph
i
suppose
they
re
horribly
hard
up
the
poor
dears
and
they
thought
a
letter
would
do
as
well
as
a
the
colour
had
risen
to
her
face
that
s
why
i
wrote
instead
of
telegraphing
i
haven
t
a
penny
to
spare
myself
nothing
she
could
have
said
could
have
filled
her
listener
with
a
deeper
contrition
he
felt
the
red
in
his
own
face
as
he
recalled
the
motive
with
which
he
had
credited
her
in
his
midnight
musings
but
that
motive
after
all
had
simply
been
trumped
up
to
justify
his
own
disloyalty
he
had
never
really
believed
in
it
the
reflection
deepened
his
confusion
and
he
would
have
liked
to
take
her
hand
in
his
and
confess
the
injustice
he
had
done
her
she
may
have
interpreted
his
change
of
colour
as
an
involuntary
protest
at
being
initiated
into
such
shabby
details
for
she
went
on
with
a
laugh
i
suppose
you
can
hardly
understand
what
it
means
to
have
to
stop
and
think
whether
one
can
afford
a
telegram
but
i
ve
always
had
to
consider
such
things
and
i
mustn
t
stay
here
any
longer
now
i
must
try
to
get
a
night
train
for
joigny
even
if
the
farlows
can
t
take
me
in
i
can
go
to
the
hotel
it
will
cost
less
than
staying
she
paused
again
and
then
exclaimed
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
sooner
i
ought
to
have
telegraphed
yesterday
but
i
was
sure
i
should
hear
from
them
today
and
i
wanted
oh
i
did
so
awfully
want
to
stay
she
threw
a
troubled
look
at
darrow
do
you
happen
to
remember
she
asked
what
time
it
was
when
you
posted
my
letter
vii
darrow
was
still
standing
on
her
threshold
as
she
put
the
question
he
entered
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
his
heart
was
beating
a
little
faster
than
usual
and
he
had
no
clear
idea
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
or
say
beyond
the
definite
conviction
that
whatever
passing
impulse
of
expiation
moved
him
he
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
tell
her
that
he
had
not
sent
her
letter
he
knew
that
most
wrongdoing
works
on
the
whole
less
mischief
than
its
useless
confession
and
this
was
clearly
a
case
where
a
passing
folly
might
be
turned
by
avowal
into
a
serious
offense
i
m
so
sorry
so
sorry
but
you
must
let
me
help
you
you
will
let
me
help
you
he
said
he
took
her
hands
and
pressed
them
together
between
his
counting
on
a
friendly
touch
to
help
out
the
insufficiency
of
words
he
felt
her
yield
slightly
to
his
clasp
and
hurried
on
without
giving
her
time
to
answer
isn
t
it
a
pity
to
spoil
our
good
time
together
by
regretting
anything
you
might
have
done
to
prevent
our
having
it
she
drew
back
freeing
her
hands
her
face
losing
its
look
of
appealing
confidence
was
suddenly
sharpened
by
distrust
you
didn
t
forget
to
post
my
letter
darrow
stood
before
her
constrained
and
ashamed
and
ever
more
keenly
aware
that
the
betrayal
of
his
distress
must
be
a
greater
offense
than
its
concealment
what
an
insinuation
he
cried
throwing
out
his
hands
with
a
laugh
her
face
instantly
melted
to
laughter
well
then
i
won
t
be
sorry
i
won
t
regret
anything
except
that
our
good
time
is
over
the
words
were
so
unexpected
that
they
routed
all
his
resolves
if
she
had
gone
on
doubting
him
he
could
probably
have
gone
on
deceiving
her
but
her
unhesitating
acceptance
of
his
word
made
him
hate
the
part
he
was
playing
at
the
same
moment
a
doubt
shot
up
its
in
his
own
bosom
was
it
not
he
rather
than
she
who
was
childishly
trustful
was
she
not
almost
too
ready
to
take
his
word
and
dismiss
once
for
all
the
tiresome
question
of
the
letter
considering
what
her
experiences
must
have
been
such
trustfulness
seemed
open
to
suspicion
but
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
on
her
he
was
ashamed
of
the
thought
and
knew
it
for
what
it
really
was
another
pretext
to
lessen
his
own
delinquency
why
should
our
good
time
be
over
he
asked
why
shouldn
t
it
last
a
little
longer
she
looked
up
her
lips
parted
in
surprise
but
before
she
could
speak
he
went
on
i
want
you
to
stay
with
me
i
want
you
just
for
a
few
days
to
have
all
the
things
you
ve
never
had
it
s
not
always
may
and
paris
why
not
make
the
most
of
them
now
you
know
me
we
re
not
strangers
why
shouldn
t
you
treat
me
like
a
friend
while
he
spoke
she
had
drawn
away
a
little
but
her
hand
still
lay
in
his
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
in
a
gaze
in
which
there
was
neither
distrust
or
resentment
but
only
an
ingenuous
wonder
he
was
extraordinarily
touched
by
her
expression
oh
do
you
must
listen
to
prove
that
i
m
sincere
i
ll
tell
you
i
ll
tell
you
i
didn
t
post
your
letter
i
didn
t
post
it
because
i
wanted
so
much
to
give
you
a
few
good
hours
and
because
i
couldn
t
bear
to
have
you
he
had
the
feeling
that
the
words
were
being
uttered
in
spite
of
him
by
some
malicious
witness
of
the
scene
and
yet
that
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
them
spoken
the
girl
had
listened
to
him
in
silence
she
remained
motionless
for
a
moment
after
he
had
ceased
to
speak
then
she
snatched
away
her
hand
you
didn
t
post
my
letter
you
kept
it
back
on
purpose
and
you
tell
me
so
now
to
prove
to
me
that
i
d
better
put
myself
under
your
protection
she
burst
into
a
laugh
that
had
in
it
all
the
piercing
echoes
of
her
murrett
past
and
her
face
at
the
same
moment
underwent
the
same
change
shrinking
into
a
small
malevolent
white
mask
in
which
the
eyes
burned
black
thank
you
thank
you
most
awfully
for
telling
me
and
for
all
your
other
kind
intentions
the
plan
s
delightful
really
quite
delightful
and
i
m
extremely
flattered
and
she
dropped
into
a
seat
beside
her
resting
her
chin
on
her
lifted
hands
and
laughing
out
at
him
under
the
which
had
shaken
itself
down
over
her
eyes
her
outburst
did
not
offend
the
young
man
its
immediate
effect
was
that
of
allaying
his
agitation
the
theatrical
touch
in
her
manner
made
his
offense
seem
more
venial
than
he
had
thought
it
a
moment
before
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
beside
her
after
all
he
said
in
a
tone
of
protest
i
needn
t
have
told
you
i
d
kept
back
your
letter
and
my
telling
you
seems
rather
strong
proof
that
i
hadn
t
any
very
nefarious
designs
on
she
met
this
with
a
shrug
but
he
did
not
give
her
time
to
answer
my
designs
he
continued
with
a
smile
were
not
nefarious
i
saw
you
d
been
through
a
bad
time
with
murrett
and
that
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
much
fun
ahead
for
you
and
i
didn
t
see
and
i
don
t
yet
see
the
harm
of
trying
to
give
you
a
few
hours
of
amusement
between
a
depressing
past
and
a
not
particularly
cheerful
he
paused
again
and
then
went
on
in
the
same
tone
of
friendly
reasonableness
the
mistake
i
made
was
not
to
tell
you
this
at
once
not
to
ask
you
straight
out
to
give
me
a
day
or
two
and
let
me
try
to
make
you
forget
all
the
things
that
are
troubling
you
i
was
a
fool
not
to
see
that
if
i
d
put
it
to
you
in
that
way
you
d
have
accepted
or
refused
as
you
chose
but
that
at
least
you
wouldn
t
have
mistaken
my
intentions
he
stood
up
walked
the
length
of
the
room
and
turned
back
to
where
she
still
sat
motionless
her
elbows
propped
on
the
her
chin
on
her
hands
what
rubbish
we
talk
about
intentions
the
truth
is
i
hadn
t
any
i
just
liked
being
with
you
perhaps
you
don
t
know
how
extraordinarily
one
can
like
being
with
you
i
was
depressed
and
adrift
myself
and
you
made
me
forget
my
bothers
and
when
i
found
you
were
going
and
going
back
to
dreariness
as
i
was
i
didn
t
see
why
we
shouldn
t
have
a
few
hours
together
first
so
i
left
your
letter
in
my
he
saw
her
face
melt
as
she
listened
and
suddenly
she
unclasped
her
hands
and
leaned
to
him
but
are
you
unhappy
too
oh
i
never
understood
i
never
dreamed
it
i
thought
you
d
always
had
everything
in
the
world
you
wanted
darrow
broke
into
a
laugh
at
this
ingenuous
picture
of
his
state
he
was
ashamed
of
trying
to
better
his
case
by
an
appeal
to
her
pity
and
annoyed
with
himself
for
alluding
to
a
subject
he
would
rather
have
kept
out
of
his
thoughts
but
her
look
of
sympathy
had
disarmed
him
his
heart
was
bitter
and
distracted
she
was
near
him
her
eyes
were
shining
with
compassion
he
bent
over
her
and
kissed
her
hand
forgive
me
do
forgive
me
he
said
she
stood
up
with
a
smiling
oh
it
s
not
so
often
that
people
try
to
give
me
any
pleasure
much
less
two
whole
days
of
it
i
sha
n
t
forget
how
kind
you
ve
been
i
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
remember
but
this
is
you
know
i
must
telegraph
at
once
to
say
i
m
to
say
you
re
coming
then
i
m
not
forgiven
oh
you
re
forgiven
if
that
s
any
it
s
not
the
very
least
if
your
way
of
proving
it
is
to
go
away
she
hung
her
head
in
meditation
but
i
can
t
how
can
i
stay
she
broke
out
as
if
arguing
with
some
unseen
monitor
why
can
t
you
no
one
knows
you
re
here
no
one
need
ever
she
looked
up
and
their
eyes
exchanged
meanings
for
a
rapid
minute
her
gaze
was
as
clear
as
a
boy
s
oh
it
s
not
that
she
exclaimed
almost
impatiently
it
s
not
people
i
m
afraid
of
they
ve
never
put
themselves
out
for
me
why
on
earth
should
i
care
about
them
he
liked
her
directness
as
he
had
never
liked
it
before
well
then
what
is
it
not
me
i
hope
no
not
you
i
like
you
it
s
the
money
with
me
that
s
always
the
root
of
the
matter
i
could
never
yet
afford
a
treat
in
my
life
is
all
he
laughed
relieved
by
her
naturalness
look
here
since
we
re
talking
as
man
to
man
can
t
you
trust
me
about
that
too
trust
you
how
do
you
mean
you
d
better
not
trust
me
she
laughed
back
sharply
i
might
never
be
able
to
pay
up
his
gesture
brushed
aside
the
allusion
money
may
be
the
root
of
the
matter
it
can
t
be
the
whole
of
it
between
friends
don
t
you
think
one
friend
may
accept
a
small
service
from
another
without
looking
too
far
ahead
or
weighing
too
many
chances
the
question
turns
entirely
on
what
you
think
of
me
if
you
like
me
well
enough
to
be
willing
to
take
a
few
days
holiday
with
me
just
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
and
the
pleasure
you
ll
be
giving
me
let
s
shake
hands
on
it
if
you
don
t
like
me
well
enough
we
ll
shake
hands
too
only
i
shall
be
sorry
he
ended
oh
but
i
shall
be
sorry
too
her
face
as
she
lifted
it
to
his
looked
so
small
and
young
that
darrow
felt
a
fugitive
twinge
of
compunction
instantly
effaced
by
the
excitement
of
pursuit
well
then
he
stood
looking
down
on
her
his
eyes
persuading
her
he
was
now
intensely
aware
that
his
nearness
was
having
an
effect
which
made
it
less
and
less
necessary
for
him
to
choose
his
words
and
he
went
on
more
mindful
of
the
inflections
of
his
voice
than
of
what
he
was
actually
saying
why
on
earth
should
we
say
if
we
re
both
sorry
to
won
t
you
tell
me
your
reason
it
s
not
a
bit
like
you
to
let
anything
stand
in
the
way
of
your
saying
just
what
you
feel
you
mustn
t
mind
offending
me
you
know
she
hung
before
him
like
a
leaf
on
the
meeting
of
that
the
next
ripple
may
sweep
forward
or
whirl
back
then
she
flung
up
her
head
with
the
odd
boyish
movement
habitual
to
her
in
moments
of
excitement
what
i
feel
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
feel
that
you
re
giving
me
the
only
chance
i
ve
ever
had
she
turned
about
on
her
heel
and
dropping
into
the
nearest
chair
sank
forward
her
face
hidden
against
the
under
the
folds
of
her
thin
summer
dress
the
modelling
of
her
back
and
of
her
lifted
arms
and
the
slight
hollow
between
her
recalled
the
faint
curves
of
a
statuette
some
young
image
of
grace
hardly
more
than
sketched
in
the
clay
darrow
as
he
stood
looking
at
her
reflected
that
her
character
for
all
its
seeming
firmness
its
flashing
edges
of
opinion
was
probably
no
less
immature
he
had
not
expected
her
to
yield
so
suddenly
to
his
suggestion
or
to
confess
her
yielding
in
that
way
at
first
he
was
slightly
disconcerted
then
he
saw
how
her
attitude
simplified
his
own
her
behaviour
had
all
the
indecision
and
awkwardness
of
inexperience
it
showed
that
she
was
a
child
after
all
and
all
he
could
do
all
he
had
ever
meant
to
do
was
to
give
her
a
child
s
holiday
to
look
back
to
for
a
moment
he
fancied
she
was
crying
but
the
next
she
was
on
her
feet
and
had
swept
round
on
him
a
face
she
must
have
turned
away
only
to
hide
the
first
rush
of
her
pleasure
for
a
while
they
shone
on
each
other
without
speaking
then
she
sprang
to
him
and
held
out
both
hands
is
it
true
is
it
really
true
is
it
really
going
to
happen
to
me
he
felt
like
answering
you
re
the
very
creature
to
whom
it
was
bound
to
happen
but
the
words
had
a
double
sense
that
made
him
wince
and
instead
he
caught
her
proffered
hands
and
stood
looking
at
her
across
the
length
of
her
arms
without
attempting
to
bend
them
or
to
draw
her
closer
he
wanted
her
to
know
how
her
words
had
moved
him
but
his
thoughts
were
blurred
by
the
rush
of
the
same
emotion
that
possessed
her
and
his
own
words
came
with
an
effort
he
ended
by
giving
her
back
a
laugh
as
frank
as
her
own
and
declaring
as
he
dropped
her
hands
all
that
and
more
too
you
ll
see
viii
all
day
since
the
late
reluctant
dawn
the
rain
had
come
down
in
torrents
it
streamed
against
darrow
s
windows
reduced
their
vast
prospect
of
roofs
and
chimneys
to
a
black
oily
huddle
and
filled
the
room
with
the
drab
twilight
of
an
underground
aquarium
the
streams
descended
with
the
regularity
of
a
third
day
s
rain
when
trimming
and
shuffling
are
over
and
the
weather
has
settled
down
to
do
its
worst
there
were
no
variations
of
rhythm
no
lyrical
ups
and
downs
the
grey
lines
streaking
the
panes
were
as
dense
and
uniform
as
a
page
of
unparagraphed
narrative
george
darrow
had
drawn
his
armchair
to
the
fire
the
he
had
been
studying
lay
on
the
floor
and
he
sat
staring
with
dull
acquiescence
into
the
boundless
blur
of
rain
which
affected
him
like
a
vast
projection
of
his
own
state
of
mind
then
his
eyes
travelled
slowly
about
the
room
it
was
exactly
ten
days
since
his
hurried
unpacking
had
strewn
it
with
the
contents
of
his
portmanteaux
his
brushes
and
razors
were
spread
out
on
the
blotched
marble
of
the
chest
of
drawers
a
stack
of
newspapers
had
accumulated
on
the
centre
table
under
the
electrolier
and
half
a
dozen
paper
novels
lay
on
the
mantelpiece
among
and
toilet
bottles
but
these
traces
of
his
passage
had
made
no
mark
on
the
featureless
dulness
of
the
room
its
look
of
being
the
makeshift
setting
of
innumerable
transient
collocations
there
was
something
sardonic
almost
sinister
in
its
appearance
of
having
deliberately
made
up
for
its
anonymous
part
all
in
noncommittal
drabs
and
browns
with
a
carpet
and
paper
that
nobody
would
remember
and
chairs
and
tables
as
impersonal
as
railway
porters
darrow
picked
up
the
and
tossed
it
on
to
the
table
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
lit
a
cigar
and
went
to
the
window
through
the
rain
he
could
just
discover
the
face
of
a
clock
in
a
tall
building
beyond
the
railway
roofs
he
pulled
out
his
watch
compared
the
two
and
started
the
hands
of
his
with
such
a
rush
that
they
flew
past
the
hour
and
he
had
to
make
them
repeat
the
circuit
more
deliberately
he
felt
a
quite
disproportionate
irritation
at
the
trifling
blunder
when
he
had
corrected
it
he
went
back
to
his
chair
and
threw
himself
down
leaning
back
his
head
against
his
hands
presently
his
cigar
went
out
and
he
got
up
hunted
for
the
matches
lit
it
again
and
returned
to
his
seat
the
room
was
getting
on
his
nerves
during
the
first
few
days
while
the
skies
were
clear
he
had
not
noticed
it
or
had
felt
for
it
only
the
contemptuous
indifference
of
the
traveller
toward
a
provisional
shelter
but
now
that
he
was
leaving
it
was
looking
at
it
for
the
last
time
it
seemed
to
have
taken
complete
possession
of
his
mind
to
be
soaking
itself
into
him
like
an
ugly
indelible
blot
every
detail
pressed
itself
on
his
notice
with
the
familiarity
of
an
accidental
confidant
whichever
way
he
turned
he
felt
the
nudge
of
a
transient
intimacy
the
one
fixed
point
in
his
immediate
future
was
that
his
leave
was
over
and
that
he
must
be
back
at
his
post
in
london
the
next
morning
within
hours
he
would
again
be
in
a
daylight
world
of
recognized
activities
himself
a
busy
responsible
relatively
necessary
factor
in
the
big
whirring
social
and
official
machine
that
fixed
obligation
was
the
fact
he
could
think
of
with
the
least
discomfort
yet
for
some
unaccountable
reason
it
was
the
one
on
which
he
found
it
most
difficult
to
fix
his
thoughts
whenever
he
did
so
the
room
jerked
him
back
into
the
circle
of
its
insistent
associations
it
was
extraordinary
with
what
a
microscopic
minuteness
of
loathing
he
hated
it
all
the
grimy
carpet
and
wallpaper
the
black
marble
the
clock
with
a
gilt
allegory
under
a
dusty
bell
the
bed
the
framed
card
of
printed
rules
under
the
electric
light
switch
and
the
door
of
communication
with
the
next
room
he
hated
the
door
most
of
all
at
the
outset
he
had
felt
no
special
sense
of
responsibility
he
was
satisfied
that
he
had
struck
the
right
note
and
convinced
of
his
power
of
sustaining
it
the
whole
incident
had
somehow
seemed
in
spite
of
its
vulgar
setting
and
its
inevitable
prosaic
propinquities
to
be
enacting
itself
in
some
unmapped
region
outside
the
pale
of
the
usual
it
was
not
like
anything
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
before
or
in
which
he
had
ever
pictured
himself
as
likely
to
be
involved
but
that
at
first
had
seemed
no
argument
against
his
fitness
to
deal
with
it
perhaps
but
for
the
three
days
rain
he
might
have
got
away
without
a
doubt
as
to
his
adequacy
the
rain
had
made
all
the
difference
it
had
thrown
the
whole
picture
out
of
perspective
blotted
out
the
mystery
of
the
remoter
planes
and
the
enchantment
of
the
middle
distance
and
thrust
into
prominence
every
commonplace
fact
of
the
foreground
it
was
the
kind
of
situation
that
was
not
helped
by
being
thought
over
and
by
the
perversity
of
circumstance
he
had
been
forced
into
the
unwilling
contemplation
of
its
every
aspect
his
cigar
had
gone
out
again
and
he
threw
it
into
the
fire
and
vaguely
meditated
getting
up
to
find
another
but
the
mere
act
of
leaving
his
chair
seemed
to
call
for
a
greater
exertion
of
the
will
than
he
was
capable
of
and
he
leaned
his
head
back
with
closed
eyes
and
listened
to
the
drumming
of
the
rain
a
different
noise
aroused
him
it
was
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
door
leading
from
the
corridor
into
the
adjoining
room
he
sat
motionless
without
opening
his
eyes
but
now
another
sight
forced
itself
under
his
lowered
lids
it
was
the
precise
photographic
picture
of
that
other
room
everything
in
it
rose
before
him
and
pressed
itself
upon
his
vision
with
the
same
acuity
of
distinctness
as
the
objects
surrounding
him
a
step
sounded
on
the
floor
and
he
knew
which
way
the
step
was
directed
what
pieces
of
furniture
it
had
to
skirt
where
it
would
probably
pause
and
what
was
likely
to
arrest
it
he
heard
another
sound
and
recognized
it
as
that
of
a
wet
umbrella
placed
in
the
black
marble
jamb
of
the
against
the
hearth
he
caught
the
creak
of
a
hinge
and
instantly
differentiated
it
as
that
of
the
wardrobe
against
the
opposite
wall
then
he
heard
the
squeal
of
a
reluctant
drawer
and
knew
it
was
the
upper
one
in
the
chest
of
drawers
beside
the
bed
the
clatter
which
followed
was
caused
by
the
mahogany
jumping
on
its
loosened
pivots
the
step
crossed
the
floor
again
it
was
strange
how
much
better
he
knew
it
than
the
person
to
whom
it
belonged
now
it
was
drawing
near
the
door
of
communication
between
the
two
rooms
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
the
step
had
ceased
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
he
heard
a
low
knock
he
made
no
response
and
after
an
interval
he
saw
that
the
door
handle
was
being
tentatively
turned
he
closed
his
eyes
once
more
the
door
opened
and
the
step
was
in
the
room
coming
cautiously
toward
him
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
relaxing
his
body
to
feign
sleep
there
was
another
pause
then
a
wavering
soft
advance
the
rustle
of
a
dress
behind
his
chair
the
warmth
of
two
hands
pressed
for
a
moment
on
his
lids
the
palms
of
the
hands
had
the
lingering
scent
of
some
stuff
that
he
had
bought
on
the
boulevard
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
letter
falling
over
his
shoulder
to
his
knee
did
i
disturb
you
i
m
so
sorry
they
gave
me
this
just
now
when
i
came
the
letter
before
he
could
catch
it
had
slipped
between
his
knees
to
the
floor
it
lay
there
address
upward
at
his
feet
and
while
he
sat
staring
down
at
the
strong
slender
characters
on
the
envelope
an
arm
reached
out
from
behind
to
pick
it
up
oh
don
t
don
t
broke
from
him
and
he
bent
over
and
caught
the
arm
the
face
above
it
was
close
to
his
don
t
what
take
the
trouble
he
stammered
he
dropped
the
arm
and
stooped
down
his
grasp
closed
over
the
letter
he
fingered
its
thickness
and
weight
and
calculated
the
number
of
sheets
it
must
contain
suddenly
he
felt
the
pressure
of
the
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
became
aware
that
the
face
was
still
leaning
over
him
and
that
in
a
moment
he
would
have
to
look
up
and
kiss
it
he
bent
forward
first
and
threw
the
unopened
letter
into
the
middle
of
the
fire
book
ii
ix
the
light
of
the
october
afternoon
lay
on
an
old
house
which
enclosed
in
its
long
expanse
of
brick
and
yellowish
stone
the
breadth
of
a
grassy
court
filled
with
the
shadow
and
sound
of
limes
from
the
escutcheoned
piers
at
the
entrance
of
the
court
a
level
drive
also
shaded
by
limes
extended
to
a
gate
beyond
which
an
equally
level
avenue
of
grass
cut
through
a
wood
dwindled
to
a
blur
against
a
sky
banked
with
still
white
slopes
of
cloud
in
the
court
between
house
and
drive
a
lady
stood
she
held
a
parasol
above
her
head
and
looked
now
at
the
with
its
double
flight
of
steps
meeting
before
a
glazed
door
under
sculptured
trophies
now
down
the
drive
toward
the
grassy
cutting
through
the
wood
her
air
was
less
of
expectancy
than
of
contemplation
she
seemed
not
so
much
to
be
watching
for
any
one
or
listening
for
an
approaching
sound
as
letting
the
whole
aspect
of
the
place
sink
into
her
while
she
held
herself
open
to
its
influence
yet
it
was
no
less
apparent
that
the
scene
was
not
new
to
her
there
was
no
eagerness
of
investigation
in
her
survey
she
seemed
rather
to
be
looking
about
her
with
eyes
to
which
for
some
intimate
inward
reason
details
long
since
familiar
had
suddenly
acquired
an
unwonted
freshness
this
was
in
fact
the
exact
sensation
of
which
leath
was
conscious
as
she
came
forth
from
the
house
and
descended
into
the
sunlit
court
she
had
come
to
meet
her
who
was
likely
to
be
returning
at
that
hour
from
an
afternoon
s
shooting
in
one
of
the
more
distant
plantations
and
she
carried
in
her
hand
the
letter
which
had
sent
her
in
search
of
him
but
with
her
first
step
out
of
the
house
all
thought
of
him
had
been
effaced
by
another
series
of
impressions
the
scene
about
her
was
known
to
satiety
she
had
seen
givre
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
and
for
the
greater
part
of
every
year
since
the
day
of
her
marriage
the
day
when
ostensibly
driving
through
its
gates
at
her
husband
s
side
she
had
actually
been
carried
there
on
a
cloud
of
visions
the
possibilities
which
the
place
had
then
represented
were
still
vividly
present
to
her
the
mere
phrase
a
french
chateau
had
called
up
to
her
youthful
fancy
a
throng
of
romantic
associations
poetic
pictorial
and
emotional
and
the
serene
face
of
the
old
house
seated
in
its
park
among
the
meadows
of
middle
france
had
seemed
on
her
first
sight
of
it
to
hold
out
to
her
a
fate
as
noble
and
dignified
as
its
own
mien
though
she
could
still
call
up
that
phase
of
feeling
it
had
long
since
passed
and
the
house
had
for
a
time
become
to
her
the
very
symbol
of
narrowness
and
monotony
then
with
the
passing
of
years
it
had
gradually
acquired
a
less
inimical
character
had
become
not
again
a
castle
of
dreams
evoker
of
fair
images
and
romantic
legend
but
the
shell
of
a
life
slowly
adjusted
to
its
dwelling
the
place
one
came
back
to
the
place
where
one
had
one
s
duties
one
s
habits
and
one
s
books
the
place
one
would
naturally
live
in
till
one
died
a
dull
house
an
inconvenient
house
of
which
one
knew
all
the
defects
the
shabbinesses
the
discomforts
but
to
which
one
was
so
used
that
one
could
hardly
after
so
long
a
time
think
one
s
self
away
from
it
without
suffering
a
certain
loss
of
identity
now
as
it
lay
before
her
in
the
autumn
mildness
its
mistress
was
surprised
at
her
own
insensibility
she
had
been
trying
to
see
the
house
through
the
eyes
of
an
old
friend
who
the
next
morning
would
be
driving
up
to
it
for
the
first
time
and
in
so
doing
she
seemed
to
be
opening
her
own
eyes
upon
it
after
a
long
interval
of
blindness
the
court
was
very
still
yet
full
of
a
latent
life
the
wheeling
and
rustling
of
pigeons
about
the
rectangular
yews
and
across
the
sunny
gravel
the
sweep
of
rooks
above
the
lustrous
slates
of
the
roof
and
the
stir
of
the
as
they
met
the
breeze
which
every
day
at
that
hour
came
punctually
up
from
the
river
just
such
a
latent
animation
glowed
in
anna
leath
in
every
nerve
and
vein
she
was
conscious
of
that
equipoise
of
bliss
which
the
fearful
human
heart
scarce
dares
acknowledge
she
was
not
used
to
strong
or
full
emotions
but
she
had
always
known
that
she
should
not
be
afraid
of
them
she
was
not
afraid
now
but
she
felt
a
deep
inward
stillness
the
immediate
effect
of
the
feeling
had
been
to
send
her
forth
in
quest
of
her
she
wanted
to
stroll
back
with
him
and
have
a
quiet
talk
before
they
the
house
it
was
always
easy
to
talk
to
him
and
at
this
moment
he
was
the
one
person
to
whom
she
could
have
spoken
without
fear
of
disturbing
her
inner
stillness
she
was
glad
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
that
madame
de
chantelle
and
effie
were
still
at
ouchy
with
the
governess
and
that
she
and
owen
had
the
house
to
themselves
and
she
was
glad
that
even
he
was
not
yet
in
sight
she
wanted
to
be
alone
a
little
longer
not
to
think
but
to
let
the
long
slow
waves
of
joy
break
over
her
one
by
one
she
walked
out
of
the
court
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
benches
that
bordered
the
drive
from
her
seat
she
had
a
diagonal
view
of
the
long
and
of
the
domed
chapel
terminating
one
of
the
wings
beyond
a
gate
in
the
wall
the
drew
its
squares
and
raised
its
statues
against
the
yellowing
background
of
the
park
in
the
borders
only
a
few
late
pinks
and
crimsons
smouldered
but
a
peacock
strutting
in
the
sun
seemed
to
have
gathered
into
his
fan
all
the
summer
glories
of
the
place
in
leath
s
hand
was
the
letter
which
had
opened
her
eyes
to
these
things
and
a
smile
rose
to
her
lips
at
the
mere
feeling
of
the
paper
between
her
fingers
the
thrill
it
sent
through
her
gave
a
keener
edge
to
every
sense
she
felt
saw
breathed
the
shining
world
as
though
a
thin
impenetrable
veil
had
suddenly
been
removed
from
it
just
such
a
veil
she
now
perceived
had
always
hung
between
herself
and
life
it
had
been
like
the
stage
gauze
which
gives
an
illusive
air
of
reality
to
the
painted
scene
behind
it
yet
proves
it
after
all
to
be
no
more
than
a
painted
scene
she
had
been
hardly
aware
in
her
girlhood
of
differing
from
others
in
this
respect
in
the
summers
world
the
unusual
was
regarded
as
either
immoral
or
and
people
with
emotions
were
not
visited
sometimes
with
a
sense
of
groping
in
a
universe
anna
had
wondered
why
everybody
about
her
seemed
to
ignore
all
the
passions
and
sensations
which
formed
the
stuff
of
great
poetry
and
memorable
action
in
a
community
composed
entirely
of
people
like
her
parents
and
her
parents
friends
she
did
not
see
how
the
magnificent
things
one
read
about
could
ever
have
happened
she
was
sure
that
if
anything
of
the
kind
had
occurred
in
her
immediate
circle
her
mother
would
have
consulted
the
family
clergyman
and
her
father
perhaps
even
have
rung
up
the
police
and
her
sense
of
humour
compelled
her
to
own
that
in
the
given
conditions
these
precautions
might
not
have
been
unjustified
little
by
little
the
conditions
conquered
her
and
she
learned
to
regard
the
substance
of
life
as
a
mere
canvas
for
the
embroideries
of
poet
and
painter
and
its
little
swept
and
fenced
and
tended
surface
as
its
actual
substance
it
was
in
the
visioned
region
of
action
and
emotion
that
her
fullest
hours
were
spent
but
it
hardly
occurred
to
her
that
they
might
be
translated
into
experience
or
connected
with
anything
likely
to
happen
to
a
young
lady
living
in
west
street
she
perceived
indeed
that
other
girls
leading
outwardly
the
same
life
as
herself
and
seemingly
unaware
of
her
world
of
hidden
beauty
were
yet
possessed
of
some
vital
secret
which
escaped
her
there
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
freemasonry
between
them
they
were
wider
awake
than
she
more
alert
and
surer
of
their
wants
if
not
of
their
opinions
she
supposed
they
were
cleverer
and
accepted
her
inferiority
half
aware
within
herself
of
a
reserve
of
unused
power
which
the
others
gave
no
sign
of
possessing
this
partly
consoled
her
for
missing
so
much
of
what
made
their
good
time
but
the
resulting
sense
of
exclusion
of
being
somehow
laughingly
but
firmly
debarred
from
a
share
of
their
privileges
threw
her
back
on
herself
and
deepened
the
reserve
which
made
envious
mothers
cite
her
as
a
model
of
ladylike
repression
love
she
told
herself
would
one
day
release
her
from
this
spell
of
unreality
she
was
persuaded
that
the
sublime
passion
was
the
key
to
the
enigma
but
it
was
difficult
to
relate
her
conception
of
love
to
the
forms
it
wore
in
her
experience
two
or
three
of
the
girls
she
had
envied
for
their
superior
acquaintance
with
the
arts
of
life
had
contracted
in
the
course
of
time
what
were
variously
described
as
romantic
or
foolish
marriages
one
even
made
a
runaway
match
and
languished
for
a
while
under
a
cloud
of
social
reprobation
here
then
was
passion
in
action
romance
converted
to
reality
yet
the
heroines
of
these
exploits
returned
from
them
untransfigured
and
their
husbands
were
as
dull
as
ever
when
one
had
to
sit
next
to
them
at
dinner
her
own
case
of
course
would
be
different
some
day
she
would
find
the
magic
bridge
between
west
street
and
life
once
or
twice
she
had
even
fancied
that
the
clue
was
in
her
hand
the
first
time
was
when
she
had
met
young
darrow
she
recalled
even
now
the
stir
of
the
encounter
but
his
passion
swept
over
her
like
a
wind
that
shakes
the
roof
of
the
forest
without
reaching
its
still
glades
or
rippling
its
hidden
pools
he
was
extraordinarily
intelligent
and
agreeable
and
her
heart
beat
faster
when
he
was
with
her
he
had
a
tall
fair
easy
presence
and
a
mind
in
which
the
lights
of
irony
played
pleasantly
through
the
shades
of
feeling
she
liked
to
hear
his
voice
almost
as
much
as
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
and
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
almost
as
much
as
to
feel
that
he
was
looking
at
her
but
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
and
she
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
books
and
pictures
and
have
him
insinuate
the
eternal
theme
of
their
love
into
every
subject
they
discussed
whenever
they
were
apart
a
reaction
set
in
she
wondered
how
she
could
have
been
so
cold
called
herself
a
prude
and
an
idiot
questioned
if
any
man
could
really
care
for
her
and
got
up
in
the
dead
of
night
to
try
new
ways
of
doing
her
hair
but
as
soon
as
he
reappeared
her
head
straightened
itself
on
her
slim
neck
and
she
sped
her
little
shafts
of
irony
or
flew
her
little
kites
of
erudition
while
hot
and
cold
waves
swept
over
her
and
the
things
she
really
wanted
to
say
choked
in
her
throat
and
burned
the
palms
of
her
hands
often
she
told
herself
that
any
silly
girl
who
had
waltzed
through
a
season
would
know
better
than
she
how
to
attract
a
man
and
hold
him
but
when
she
said
a
man
she
did
not
really
mean
george
darrow
then
one
day
at
a
dinner
she
saw
him
sitting
next
to
one
of
the
silly
girls
in
question
the
heroine
of
the
elopement
which
had
shaken
west
street
to
its
base
the
young
lady
had
come
back
from
her
adventure
no
less
silly
than
when
she
went
and
across
the
table
the
partner
of
her
flight
a
fat
young
man
with
sat
stolidly
eating
terrapin
and
talking
about
polo
and
investments
the
young
woman
was
undoubtedly
as
silly
as
ever
yet
after
watching
her
for
a
few
minutes
miss
summers
perceived
that
she
had
somehow
grown
luminous
perilous
obscurely
menacing
to
nice
girls
and
the
young
men
they
intended
eventually
to
accept
suddenly
at
the
sight
a
rage
of
possessorship
awoke
in
her
she
must
save
darrow
assert
her
right
to
him
at
any
price
pride
and
reticence
went
down
in
a
hurricane
of
jealousy
she
heard
him
laugh
and
there
was
something
new
in
his
laugh
she
watched
him
talking
talking
he
sat
slightly
sideways
a
faint
smile
beneath
his
lids
lowering
his
voice
as
he
lowered
it
when
he
talked
to
her
she
caught
the
same
inflections
but
his
eyes
were
different
it
would
have
offended
her
once
if
he
had
looked
at
her
like
that
now
her
one
thought
was
that
none
but
she
had
a
right
to
be
so
looked
at
and
that
girl
of
all
others
what
illusions
could
he
have
about
a
girl
who
hardly
a
year
ago
had
made
a
fool
of
herself
over
the
fat
young
man
stolidly
eating
terrapin
across
the
table
if
that
was
where
romance
and
passion
ended
it
was
better
to
take
to
district
visiting
or
algebra
all
night
she
lay
awake
and
wondered
what
was
she
saying
to
him
how
shall
i
learn
to
say
such
things
and
she
decided
that
her
heart
would
tell
her
that
the
next
time
they
were
alone
together
the
irresistible
word
would
spring
to
her
lips
he
came
the
next
day
and
they
were
alone
and
all
she
found
was
i
didn
t
know
that
you
and
kitty
mayne
were
such
he
answered
with
indifference
that
he
didn
t
know
it
either
and
in
the
reaction
of
relief
she
declared
she
s
certainly
ever
so
much
prettier
than
she
was
she
s
rather
good
fun
he
admitted
as
though
he
had
not
noticed
her
other
advantages
and
suddenly
anna
saw
in
his
eyes
the
look
she
had
seen
there
the
previous
evening
she
felt
as
if
he
were
leagues
and
leagues
away
from
her
all
her
hopes
dissolved
and
she
was
conscious
of
sitting
rigidly
with
high
head
and
straight
lips
while
the
irresistible
word
fled
with
a
last
into
the
golden
mist
of
her
illusions
she
was
still
quivering
with
the
pain
and
bewilderment
of
this
adventure
when
fraser
leath
appeared
she
met
him
first
in
italy
where
she
was
travelling
with
her
parents
and
the
following
winter
he
came
to
new
york
in
italy
he
had
seemed
interesting
in
new
york
he
became
remarkable
he
seldom
spoke
of
his
life
in
europe
and
let
drop
but
the
most
incidental
allusions
to
the
friends
the
tastes
the
pursuits
which
filled
his
cosmopolitan
days
but
in
the
atmosphere
of
west
street
he
seemed
the
embodiment
of
a
storied
past
he
presented
miss
summers
with
a
anthology
of
the
old
french
poets
and
when
she
showed
a
discriminating
pleasure
in
the
gift
observed
with
his
grave
smile
i
didn
t
suppose
i
should
find
any
one
here
who
would
feel
about
these
things
as
i
on
another
occasion
he
asked
her
acceptance
of
a
eighteenth
century
pastel
which
he
had
surprisingly
picked
up
in
a
new
york
i
know
no
one
but
you
who
would
really
appreciate
it
he
explained
he
permitted
himself
no
other
comments
but
these
conveyed
with
sufficient
directness
that
he
thought
her
worthy
of
a
different
setting
that
she
should
be
so
regarded
by
a
man
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
art
and
beauty
and
esteeming
them
the
vital
elements
of
life
made
her
feel
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
understood
here
was
some
one
whose
scale
of
values
was
the
same
as
hers
and
who
thought
her
opinion
worth
hearing
on
the
very
matters
which
they
both
considered
of
supreme
importance
the
discovery
restored
her
and
she
revealed
herself
to
leath
as
she
had
never
known
how
to
reveal
herself
to
darrow
as
the
courtship
progressed
and
they
grew
more
confidential
her
suitor
surprised
and
delighted
her
by
little
explosions
of
revolutionary
sentiment
he
said
shall
you
mind
i
wonder
if
i
tell
you
that
you
live
in
a
conventional
atmosphere
and
seeing
that
she
manifestly
did
not
mind
of
course
i
shall
say
things
now
and
then
that
will
horrify
your
dear
delightful
parents
i
shall
shock
them
awfully
i
warn
in
confirmation
of
this
warning
he
permitted
himself
an
occasional
playful
fling
at
the
regular
of
and
summers
at
the
innocuous
character
of
the
literature
in
their
library
and
at
their
guileless
appreciations
in
art
he
even
ventured
to
banter
summers
on
her
refusal
to
receive
the
irrepressible
kitty
mayne
who
after
a
rapid
passage
with
george
darrow
was
now
involved
in
another
and
more
flagrant
adventure
in
europe
you
know
the
husband
is
regarded
as
the
only
judge
in
such
matters
as
long
as
he
accepts
the
situation
leath
explained
to
anna
who
took
his
view
the
more
emphatically
in
order
to
convince
herself
that
personally
she
had
none
but
the
most
tolerant
sentiments
toward
the
lady
the
subversiveness
of
leath
s
opinions
was
enhanced
by
the
distinction
of
his
appearance
and
the
reserve
of
his
manners
he
was
like
the
anarchist
with
a
gardenia
in
his
buttonhole
who
figures
in
the
higher
melodrama
every
word
every
allusion
every
note
of
his
voice
gave
anna
a
glimpse
of
a
society
at
once
freer
and
finer
which
observed
the
traditional
forms
but
had
discarded
the
underlying
prejudices
whereas
the
world
she
knew
had
discarded
many
of
the
forms
and
kept
almost
all
the
prejudices
in
such
an
atmosphere
as
his
an
eager
young
woman
curious
as
to
all
the
manifestations
of
life
yet
instinctively
desiring
that
they
should
come
to
her
in
terms
of
beauty
and
fine
feeling
must
surely
find
the
largest
scope
for
study
travel
the
contact
of
the
world
the
comradeship
of
a
polished
and
enlightened
mind
would
combine
to
enrich
her
days
and
form
her
character
and
it
was
only
in
the
rare
moments
when
leath
s
symmetrical
blond
mask
bent
over
hers
and
his
kiss
dropped
on
her
like
a
cold
smooth
pebble
that
she
questioned
the
completeness
of
the
joys
he
offered
there
had
been
a
time
when
the
walls
on
which
her
gaze
now
rested
had
shed
a
glare
of
irony
on
these
early
dreams
in
the
first
years
of
her
marriage
the
sober
symmetry
of
givre
had
suggested
only
her
husband
s
mind
it
was
a
mind
she
soon
learned
contentedly
absorbed
in
formulating
the
conventions
of
the
unconventional
west
street
was
no
more
conscientiously
concerned
than
givre
with
the
momentous
question
of
what
people
did
it
was
only
the
type
of
deed
investigated
that
was
different
leath
collected
his
social
instances
with
the
same
seriousness
and
patience
as
his
he
exacted
a
rigid
conformity
to
his
rules
of
and
his
scepticism
had
the
absolute
accent
of
a
dogma
he
even
cherished
certain
exceptions
to
his
rules
as
the
prizes
a
defective
first
edition
the
protestant
of
anna
s
parents
had
provoked
his
gentle
sarcasm
but
he
prided
himself
on
his
mother
s
devoutness
because
madame
de
chantelle
in
embracing
her
second
husband
s
creed
had
become
part
of
a
society
which
still
observes
the
outward
rites
of
piety
anna
in
fact
had
discovered
in
her
amiable
and
elegant
an
unexpected
embodiment
of
the
west
street
ideal
summers
and
madame
de
chantelle
however
strongly
they
would
have
disagreed
as
to
the
authorized
source
of
christian
dogma
would
have
found
themselves
completely
in
accord
on
all
the
momentous
minutiae
of
conduct
yet
leath
treated
his
mother
s
foibles
with
a
respect
which
anna
s
experience
of
him
forbade
her
to
attribute
wholly
to
filial
affection
in
the
early
days
when
she
was
still
questioning
the
sphinx
instead
of
trying
to
find
an
answer
to
it
she
ventured
to
tax
her
husband
with
his
inconsistency
you
say
your
mother
won
t
like
it
if
i
call
on
that
amusing
little
woman
who
came
here
the
other
day
and
was
let
in
by
mistake
but
madame
de
chantelle
tells
me
she
lives
with
her
husband
and
when
mother
refused
to
visit
kitty
mayne
you
said
leath
s
smile
arrested
her
my
dear
child
i
don
t
pretend
to
apply
the
principles
of
logic
to
my
poor
mother
s
but
if
you
admit
that
they
are
prejudices
there
are
prejudices
and
prejudices
my
mother
of
course
got
hers
from
monsieur
de
chantelle
and
they
seem
to
me
as
much
in
their
place
in
this
house
as
the
in
your
hawthorn
jar
they
preserve
a
social
tradition
of
which
i
should
be
sorry
to
lose
the
least
perfume
of
course
i
don
t
expect
you
just
at
first
to
feel
the
difference
to
see
the
nuance
in
the
case
of
little
madame
de
vireville
for
instance
you
point
out
that
she
s
still
under
her
husband
s
roof
very
true
and
if
she
were
merely
a
paris
acquaintance
especially
if
you
had
met
her
as
one
still
might
in
the
right
kind
of
house
in
paris
i
should
be
the
last
to
object
to
your
visiting
her
but
in
the
country
it
s
different
even
the
best
provincial
society
is
what
you
would
call
narrow
i
don
t
deny
it
and
if
some
of
our
friends
met
madame
de
vireville
at
givre
well
it
would
produce
a
bad
impression
you
re
inclined
to
ridicule
such
considerations
but
gradually
you
ll
come
to
see
their
importance
and
meanwhile
do
trust
me
when
i
ask
you
to
be
guided
by
my
mother
it
is
always
well
for
a
stranger
in
an
old
society
to
err
a
little
on
the
side
of
what
you
call
its
prejudices
but
i
should
rather
describe
as
its
after
that
she
no
longer
tried
to
laugh
or
argue
her
husband
out
of
his
convictions
they
were
convictions
and
therefore
unassailable
nor
was
any
insincerity
implied
in
the
fact
that
they
sometimes
seemed
to
coincide
with
hers
there
were
occasions
when
he
really
did
look
at
things
as
she
did
but
for
reasons
so
different
as
to
make
the
distance
between
them
all
the
greater
life
to
leath
was
like
a
walk
through
a
carefully
classified
museum
where
in
moments
of
doubt
one
had
only
to
look
at
the
number
and
refer
to
one
s
catalogue
to
his
wife
it
was
like
groping
about
in
a
huge
dark
where
the
exploring
ray
of
curiosity
lit
up
now
some
shape
of
breathing
beauty
and
now
a
mummy
s
grin
in
the
first
bewilderment
of
her
new
state
these
discoveries
had
had
the
effect
of
dropping
another
layer
of
gauze
between
herself
and
reality
she
seemed
farther
than
ever
removed
from
the
strong
joys
and
pangs
for
which
she
felt
herself
made
she
did
not
adopt
her
husband
s
views
but
insensibly
she
began
to
live
his
life
she
tried
to
throw
a
compensating
ardour
into
the
secret
excursions
of
her
spirit
and
thus
the
old
vicious
distinction
between
romance
and
reality
was
for
her
and
she
resigned
herself
again
to
the
belief
that
real
life
was
neither
real
nor
alive
the
birth
of
her
little
girl
swept
away
this
delusion
at
last
she
felt
herself
in
contact
with
the
actual
business
of
living
but
even
this
impression
was
not
enduring
everything
but
the
irreducible
crude
fact
of
assumed
in
the
leath
household
the
same
ghostly
tinge
of
unreality
her
husband
at
the
time
was
all
that
his
own
ideal
of
a
husband
required
he
was
attentive
and
even
suitably
moved
but
as
he
sat
by
her
bedside
and
thoughtfully
proffered
to
her
the
list
of
people
who
had
called
to
enquire
she
looked
first
at
him
and
then
at
the
child
between
them
and
wondered
at
the
blundering
alchemy
of
nature
with
the
exception
of
the
little
girl
herself
everything
connected
with
that
time
had
grown
curiously
remote
and
unimportant
the
days
that
had
moved
so
slowly
as
they
passed
seemed
now
to
have
plunged
down
steeps
of
time
and
as
she
sat
in
the
autumn
sun
with
darrow
s
letter
in
her
hand
the
history
of
anna
leath
appeared
to
its
heroine
like
some
grey
shadowy
tale
that
she
might
have
read
in
an
old
book
one
night
as
she
was
falling
asleep
x
two
brown
blurs
emerging
from
the
farther
end
of
the
gradually
defined
themselves
as
her
and
an
attendant
they
grew
slowly
upon
the
bluish
background
with
occasional
delays
and
and
she
sat
still
waiting
till
they
should
reach
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
drive
where
the
keeper
would
turn
off
to
his
cottage
and
owen
continue
on
to
the
house
she
watched
his
approach
with
a
smile
from
the
first
days
of
her
marriage
she
had
been
drawn
to
the
boy
but
it
was
not
until
after
effie
s
birth
that
she
had
really
begun
to
know
him
the
eager
observation
of
her
own
child
had
shown
her
how
much
she
had
still
to
learn
about
the
slight
fair
boy
whom
the
holidays
periodically
restored
to
givre
owen
even
then
both
physically
and
morally
furnished
her
with
the
oddest
of
commentaries
on
his
father
s
mien
and
mind
he
would
never
the
family
sighingly
recognized
be
nearly
as
handsome
as
leath
but
his
rather
charmingly
unbalanced
face
with
its
brooding
forehead
and
petulant
boyish
smile
suggested
to
anna
what
his
father
s
countenance
might
have
been
could
one
have
pictured
its
neat
features
disordered
by
a
rattling
breeze
she
even
pushed
the
analogy
farther
and
descried
in
her
s
mind
a
reflection
of
her
husband
s
with
his
bursts
of
activity
his
fits
of
bookish
indolence
his
crude
revolutionary
dogmatizing
and
his
flashes
of
precocious
irony
the
boy
was
not
unlike
a
boisterous
embodiment
of
his
father
s
theories
it
was
as
though
fraser
leath
s
ideas
accustomed
to
hang
like
marionettes
on
their
pegs
should
suddenly
come
down
and
walk
there
were
moments
indeed
when
owen
s
humours
must
have
suggested
to
his
progenitor
the
gambols
of
an
infant
frankenstein
but
to
anna
they
were
the
voice
of
her
secret
rebellions
and
her
tenderness
to
her
was
partly
based
on
her
severity
toward
herself
as
he
had
the
courage
she
had
lacked
so
she
meant
him
to
have
the
chances
she
had
missed
and
every
effort
she
made
for
him
helped
to
keep
her
own
hopes
alive
her
interest
in
owen
led
her
to
think
more
often
of
his
mother
and
sometimes
she
would
slip
away
and
stand
alone
before
her
predecessor
s
portrait
since
her
arrival
at
givre
the
picture
a
by
a
once
fashionable
artist
had
undergone
the
successive
displacements
of
an
exiled
consort
removed
farther
and
farther
from
the
throne
and
anna
could
not
help
noting
that
these
stages
coincided
with
the
gradual
decline
of
the
artist
s
fame
she
had
a
fancy
that
if
his
credit
had
been
in
the
ascendant
the
first
leath
might
have
continued
to
throne
over
the
even
to
the
exclusion
of
her
successor
s
effigy
instead
of
this
her
peregrinations
had
finally
landed
her
in
the
shrouded
solitude
of
the
an
apartment
which
no
one
ever
entered
but
where
it
was
understood
that
the
light
was
better
or
might
have
been
if
the
shutters
had
not
been
always
closed
here
the
poor
lady
elegantly
dressed
and
seated
in
the
middle
of
a
large
lonely
canvas
in
the
blank
contemplation
of
a
gilt
console
had
always
seemed
to
anna
to
be
waiting
for
visitors
who
never
came
of
course
they
never
came
you
poor
thing
i
wonder
how
long
it
took
you
to
find
out
that
they
never
would
anna
had
more
than
once
apostrophized
her
with
a
derision
addressed
rather
to
herself
than
to
the
dead
but
it
was
only
after
effie
s
birth
that
it
occurred
to
her
to
study
more
closely
the
face
in
the
picture
and
speculate
on
the
kind
of
visitors
that
owen
s
mother
might
have
hoped
for
she
certainly
doesn
t
look
as
if
they
would
have
been
the
same
kind
as
mine
but
there
s
no
telling
from
a
portrait
that
was
so
obviously
done
to
please
the
family
and
that
leaves
owen
so
unaccounted
for
well
they
never
came
the
visitors
they
never
came
and
she
died
of
it
she
died
of
it
long
before
they
buried
her
i
m
certain
of
that
those
are
eyes
in
the
picture
the
loneliness
must
have
been
awful
if
even
owen
couldn
t
keep
her
from
dying
of
it
and
to
feel
it
so
she
must
have
had
feelings
real
live
ones
the
kind
that
twitch
and
tug
and
all
she
had
to
look
at
all
her
life
was
a
gilt
console
yes
that
s
it
a
gilt
console
screwed
to
the
wall
that
s
exactly
and
absolutely
what
he
is
she
did
not
mean
if
she
could
help
it
that
either
effie
or
owen
should
know
that
loneliness
or
let
her
know
it
again
they
were
three
now
to
keep
each
other
warm
and
she
embraced
both
children
in
the
same
passion
of
motherhood
as
though
one
were
not
enough
to
shield
her
from
her
predecessor
s
fate
sometimes
she
fancied
that
owen
leath
s
response
was
warmer
than
that
of
her
own
child
but
then
effie
was
still
hardly
more
than
a
baby
and
owen
from
the
first
had
been
almost
old
enough
to
understand
certainly
did
understand
now
in
a
tacit
way
that
yet
perpetually
spoke
to
her
this
sense
of
his
understanding
was
the
deepest
element
in
their
feeling
for
each
other
there
were
so
many
things
between
them
that
were
never
spoken
of
or
even
indirectly
alluded
to
yet
that
even
in
their
occasional
discussions
and
differences
formed
the
unadduced
arguments
making
for
final
agreement
musing
on
this
she
continued
to
watch
his
approach
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
a
little
faster
at
the
thought
of
what
she
had
to
say
to
him
but
when
he
reached
the
gate
she
saw
him
pause
and
after
a
moment
he
turned
aside
as
if
to
gain
a
through
the
park
she
started
up
and
waved
her
sunshade
but
he
did
not
see
her
no
doubt
he
meant
to
go
back
with
the
gamekeeper
perhaps
to
the
kennels
to
see
a
retriever
who
had
hurt
his
leg
suddenly
she
was
seized
by
the
whim
to
overtake
him
she
threw
down
the
parasol
thrust
her
letter
into
her
bodice
and
catching
up
her
skirts
began
to
run
she
was
slight
and
light
with
a
natural
ease
and
quickness
of
gait
but
she
could
not
recall
having
run
a
yard
since
she
had
romped
with
owen
in
his
nor
did
she
know
what
impulse
moved
her
now
she
only
knew
that
run
she
must
that
no
other
motion
short
of
flight
would
have
been
buoyant
enough
for
her
humour
she
seemed
to
be
keeping
pace
with
some
inward
rhythm
seeking
to
give
bodily
expression
to
the
lyric
rush
of
her
thoughts
the
earth
always
felt
elastic
under
her
and
she
had
a
conscious
joy
in
treading
it
but
never
had
it
been
as
soft
and
springy
as
today
it
seemed
actually
to
rise
and
meet
her
as
she
went
so
that
she
had
the
feeling
which
sometimes
came
to
her
in
dreams
of
skimming
miraculously
over
short
bright
waves
the
air
too
seemed
to
break
in
waves
against
her
sweeping
by
on
its
current
all
the
slanted
lights
and
moist
sharp
perfumes
of
the
failing
day
she
panted
to
herself
this
is
nonsense
her
blood
hummed
back
but
it
s
glorious
and
she
sped
on
till
she
saw
that
owen
had
caught
sight
of
her
and
was
striding
back
in
her
direction
then
she
stopped
and
waited
flushed
and
laughing
her
hands
clasped
against
the
letter
in
her
breast
no
i
m
not
mad
she
called
out
but
there
s
something
in
the
air
today
don
t
you
feel
it
and
i
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
she
added
as
he
came
up
to
her
smiling
at
him
and
linking
her
arm
in
his
he
smiled
back
but
above
the
smile
she
saw
the
shade
of
anxiety
which
for
the
last
two
months
had
kept
its
fixed
line
between
his
handsome
eyes
owen
don
t
look
like
that
i
don
t
want
you
to
she
said
imperiously
he
laughed
you
said
that
exactly
like
effie
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
to
race
with
you
as
i
do
effie
but
i
shouldn
t
have
a
show
he
protested
still
with
the
little
frown
between
his
eyes
where
are
you
going
she
asked
to
the
kennels
but
there
s
not
the
least
need
the
vet
has
seen
garry
and
he
s
all
right
if
there
s
anything
you
wanted
to
tell
me
did
i
say
there
was
i
just
came
out
to
meet
you
i
wanted
to
know
if
you
d
had
good
the
shadow
dropped
on
him
again
none
at
all
the
fact
is
i
didn
t
try
jean
and
i
have
just
been
knocking
about
in
the
woods
i
wasn
t
in
a
sanguinary
they
walked
on
with
the
same
light
gait
so
nearly
of
a
height
that
keeping
step
came
as
naturally
to
them
as
breathing
anna
stole
another
look
at
the
young
face
on
a
level
with
her
own
you
did
say
there
was
something
you
wanted
to
tell
me
her
began
after
a
pause
well
there
she
slackened
her
pace
involuntarily
and
they
came
to
a
pause
and
stood
facing
each
other
under
the
limes
is
darrow
coming
he
asked
she
seldom
blushed
but
at
the
question
a
sudden
heat
suffused
her
she
held
her
head
high
yes
he
s
coming
i
ve
just
heard
he
arrives
but
that
s
not
she
saw
her
blunder
and
tried
to
rectify
it
or
rather
yes
in
a
way
it
is
my
reason
for
wanting
to
speak
to
you
because
he
s
coming
because
he
s
not
yet
it
s
about
him
then
he
looked
at
her
kindly
an
almost
fraternal
wisdom
in
his
smile
about
no
no
i
meant
that
i
wanted
to
speak
today
because
it
s
our
last
day
alone
oh
i
he
had
slipped
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
tweed
shooting
jacket
and
lounged
along
at
her
side
his
eyes
bent
on
the
moist
ruts
of
the
drive
as
though
the
matter
had
lost
all
interest
for
him
owen
he
stopped
again
and
faced
her
look
here
my
dear
it
s
no
sort
of
what
s
no
use
anything
on
earth
you
can
any
of
you
she
challenged
him
am
i
one
of
any
of
you
he
did
not
yield
well
then
anything
on
earth
that
even
you
can
you
don
t
in
the
least
know
what
i
can
say
or
what
i
mean
don
t
i
generally
she
gave
him
this
point
but
only
to
make
another
yes
but
this
is
particularly
i
want
to
say
owen
you
ve
been
admirable
all
he
broke
into
a
laugh
in
which
the
odd
note
was
once
more
perceptible
admirable
she
emphasized
and
so
has
oh
and
so
have
you
to
her
his
voice
broke
down
to
boyishness
i
ve
never
lost
sight
of
that
for
a
minute
it
s
been
altogether
easier
for
her
though
he
threw
off
presently
on
the
whole
i
suppose
it
has
well
she
summed
up
with
a
laugh
aren
t
you
all
the
better
pleased
to
be
told
you
ve
behaved
as
well
as
she
oh
you
know
i
ve
not
done
it
for
you
he
tossed
back
at
her
without
the
least
note
of
hostility
in
the
affected
lightness
of
his
tone
haven
t
you
though
perhaps
the
least
bit
because
after
all
you
knew
i
understood
you
ve
been
awfully
kind
about
pretending
she
laughed
you
don
t
believe
me
you
must
remember
i
had
your
grandmother
to
yes
and
my
father
and
effie
i
suppose
and
the
outraged
shades
of
givre
he
paused
as
if
to
lay
more
stress
on
the
boyish
sneer
do
you
likewise
include
the
late
monsieur
de
chantelle
his
did
not
appear
to
resent
the
thrust
she
went
on
in
the
same
tone
of
affectionate
persuasion
yes
i
must
have
seemed
to
you
too
subject
to
givre
perhaps
i
have
been
but
you
know
that
was
not
my
real
object
in
asking
you
to
wait
to
say
nothing
to
your
grandmother
before
her
he
considered
your
real
object
of
course
was
to
gain
yes
but
for
whom
why
not
for
you
for
me
he
flushed
up
quickly
you
don
t
mean
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
gravely
into
his
handsome
eyes
i
mean
that
when
your
grandmother
gets
back
from
ouchy
i
shall
speak
to
her
you
ll
speak
to
her
yes
if
only
you
ll
promise
to
give
me
time
time
for
her
to
send
for
adelaide
painter
oh
she
ll
undoubtedly
send
for
adelaide
painter
the
allusion
touched
a
spring
of
mirth
in
both
their
minds
and
they
exchanged
a
laughing
look
only
you
must
promise
not
to
rush
things
you
must
give
me
time
to
prepare
adelaide
too
leath
went
on
prepare
her
too
he
drew
away
for
a
better
look
at
her
prepare
her
for
what
why
to
prepare
your
grandmother
for
your
marriage
yes
that
s
what
i
mean
i
m
going
to
see
you
through
you
know
his
feint
of
indifference
broke
down
and
he
caught
her
hand
oh
you
dear
divine
thing
i
didn
t
dream
i
know
you
didn
she
dropped
her
gaze
and
began
to
walk
on
slowly
i
can
t
say
you
ve
convinced
me
of
the
wisdom
of
the
step
only
i
seem
to
see
that
other
things
matter
more
and
that
not
missing
things
matters
most
perhaps
i
ve
changed
or
your
not
changing
has
convinced
me
i
m
certain
now
that
you
won
t
budge
and
that
was
really
all
i
ever
cared
oh
as
to
not
budging
i
told
you
so
months
ago
you
might
have
been
sure
of
that
and
how
can
you
be
any
surer
today
than
yesterday
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
one
learns
something
every
day
not
at
givre
he
laughed
and
shot
a
look
at
her
but
you
haven
t
really
been
at
givre
lately
not
for
months
don
t
you
suppose
i
ve
noticed
that
my
dear
she
echoed
his
laugh
to
merge
it
in
an
undenying
sigh
poor
givre
poor
empty
givre
with
so
many
rooms
full
and
yet
not
a
soul
in
it
except
of
course
my
grandmother
who
is
its
soul
they
had
reached
the
gateway
of
the
court
and
stood
looking
with
a
common
accord
at
the
long
facade
on
which
the
autumn
light
was
dying
it
looks
so
made
to
be
happy
in
she
murmured
yes
today
today
he
pressed
her
arm
a
little
oh
you
darling
to
have
given
it
that
look
for
me
he
paused
and
then
went
on
in
a
lower
voice
don
t
you
feel
we
owe
it
to
the
poor
old
place
to
do
what
we
can
to
give
it
that
look
you
too
i
mean
come
let
s
make
it
grin
from
wing
to
wing
i
ve
such
a
mad
desire
to
say
outrageous
things
to
it
haven
t
you
after
all
in
old
times
there
must
have
been
living
people
here
loosening
her
arm
from
his
she
continued
to
gaze
up
at
the
which
seemed
in
the
plaintive
decline
of
light
to
send
her
back
the
mute
appeal
of
something
doomed
it
is
beautiful
she
said
a
beautiful
memory
quite
perfect
to
take
out
and
turn
over
when
i
m
grinding
at
the
law
in
new
york
and
you
re
he
broke
off
and
looked
at
her
with
a
questioning
smile
come
tell
me
you
and
i
don
t
have
to
say
things
to
talk
to
each
other
when
you
turn
suddenly
absentminded
and
mysterious
i
always
feel
like
saying
come
back
all
is
discovered
she
returned
his
smile
you
know
as
much
as
i
know
i
promise
you
he
wavered
as
if
for
the
first
time
uncertain
how
far
he
might
go
i
don
t
know
darrow
as
much
as
you
know
him
he
presently
risked
she
frowned
a
little
you
said
just
now
we
didn
t
need
to
say
things
was
i
speaking
i
thought
it
was
your
eyes
he
caught
her
by
both
elbows
and
spun
her
halfway
round
so
that
the
late
sun
shed
a
betraying
gleam
on
her
face
they
re
such
awfully
conversational
eyes
don
t
you
suppose
they
told
me
long
ago
why
it
s
just
today
you
ve
made
up
your
mind
that
people
have
got
to
live
their
own
lives
even
at
givre
xi
this
is
the
south
terrace
anna
said
should
you
like
to
walk
down
to
the
river
she
seemed
to
listen
to
herself
speaking
from
a
airy
height
and
yet
to
be
wholly
gathered
into
the
circle
of
consciousness
which
drew
its
glowing
ring
about
herself
and
darrow
to
the
aerial
listener
her
words
sounded
flat
and
colourless
but
to
the
self
within
the
ring
each
one
beat
with
a
separate
heart
it
was
the
day
after
darrow
s
arrival
and
he
had
come
down
early
drawn
by
the
sweetness
of
the
light
on
the
lawns
and
gardens
below
his
window
anna
had
heard
the
echo
of
his
step
on
the
stairs
his
pause
in
the
hall
his
voice
as
he
asked
a
servant
where
to
find
her
she
was
at
the
end
of
the
house
in
the
which
she
frequented
at
that
season
because
it
caught
the
sunlight
first
and
kept
it
longest
she
stood
near
the
window
in
the
pale
band
of
brightness
arranging
some
geraniums
in
a
shallow
porcelain
bowl
every
sensation
of
touch
and
sight
was
in
her
the
fur
of
the
geranium
leaves
caressed
her
fingers
and
the
sunlight
wavering
across
the
irregular
surface
of
the
old
parquet
floor
made
it
seem
as
bright
and
shifting
as
the
brown
bed
of
a
stream
darrow
stood
framed
in
the
of
the
farthest
a
figure
against
the
black
and
white
flagging
of
the
hall
then
he
began
to
move
toward
her
down
the
empty
vista
crossing
one
after
another
the
long
reflections
which
a
projecting
cabinet
or
screen
cast
here
and
there
upon
the
shining
floors
as
he
drew
nearer
his
figure
was
suddenly
displaced
by
that
of
her
husband
whom
from
the
same
point
she
had
so
often
seen
advancing
down
the
same
perspective
straight
spare
erect
looking
to
right
and
left
with
quick
precise
turns
of
the
head
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
straighten
a
chair
or
alter
the
position
of
a
vase
fraser
leath
used
to
march
toward
her
through
the
double
file
of
furniture
like
a
general
reviewing
a
regiment
drawn
up
for
his
inspection
at
a
certain
point
midway
across
the
second
room
he
always
stopped
before
the
of
marble
and
looked
at
himself
in
the
tall
garlanded
glass
that
surmounted
it
she
could
not
remember
that
he
had
ever
found
anything
to
straighten
or
alter
in
his
own
studied
attire
but
she
had
never
known
him
to
omit
the
inspection
when
he
passed
that
particular
mirror
when
it
was
over
he
continued
more
briskly
on
his
way
and
the
resulting
expression
of
satisfaction
was
still
on
his
face
when
he
entered
the
oak
to
greet
his
wife
the
spectral
projection
of
this
little
daily
scene
hung
but
for
a
moment
before
anna
but
in
that
moment
she
had
time
to
fling
a
wondering
glance
across
the
distance
between
her
past
and
present
then
the
footsteps
of
the
present
came
close
and
she
had
to
drop
the
geraniums
to
give
her
hand
to
darrow
yes
let
us
walk
down
to
the
they
had
neither
of
them
as
yet
found
much
to
say
to
each
other
darrow
had
arrived
late
on
the
previous
afternoon
and
during
the
evening
they
had
had
between
them
owen
leath
and
their
own
thoughts
now
they
were
alone
for
the
first
time
and
the
fact
was
enough
in
itself
yet
anna
was
intensely
aware
that
as
soon
as
they
began
to
talk
more
intimately
they
would
feel
that
they
knew
each
other
less
well
they
passed
out
onto
the
terrace
and
down
the
steps
to
the
gravel
walk
below
the
delicate
frosting
of
dew
gave
the
grass
a
bluish
shimmer
and
the
sunlight
sliding
in
emerald
streaks
along
the
gathered
itself
into
great
luminous
blurs
at
the
end
of
the
and
hung
above
the
fields
a
watery
glory
like
the
ring
about
an
autumn
moon
it
s
good
to
be
here
darrow
said
they
took
a
turn
to
the
left
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
back
at
the
long
pink
plainer
friendlier
less
adorned
than
on
the
side
toward
the
court
so
prolonged
yet
delicate
had
been
the
friction
of
time
upon
its
bricks
that
certain
expanses
had
the
bloom
and
texture
of
old
red
velvet
and
the
patches
of
gold
lichen
spreading
over
them
looked
like
the
last
traces
of
a
dim
embroidery
the
dome
of
the
chapel
with
its
gilded
cross
rose
above
one
wing
and
the
other
ended
in
a
conical
above
which
the
birds
were
flying
lustrous
and
slatey
their
breasts
merged
in
the
blue
of
the
roof
when
they
dropped
down
on
it
and
this
is
where
you
ve
been
all
these
they
turned
away
and
began
to
walk
down
a
long
tunnel
of
yellowing
trees
benches
with
mossy
feet
stood
against
the
mossy
edges
of
the
path
and
at
its
farther
end
it
widened
into
a
circle
about
a
basin
rimmed
with
stone
in
which
the
opaque
water
strewn
with
leaves
looked
like
a
slab
of
agate
the
path
growing
narrower
wound
on
circuitously
through
the
woods
between
slender
serried
trunks
twined
with
ivy
patches
of
blue
appeared
above
them
through
the
dwindling
leaves
and
presently
the
trees
drew
back
and
showed
the
open
fields
along
the
river
they
walked
on
across
the
fields
to
the
in
a
curve
of
the
wall
some
steps
led
up
to
a
crumbling
pavilion
with
openings
choked
with
ivy
anna
and
darrow
seated
themselves
on
the
bench
projecting
from
the
inner
wall
of
the
pavilion
and
looked
across
the
river
at
the
slopes
divided
into
blocks
of
green
and
and
at
the
village
lifting
its
squat
and
grey
roofs
against
the
precisely
drawn
lines
of
the
landscape
anna
sat
silent
so
intensely
aware
of
darrow
s
nearness
that
there
was
no
surprise
in
the
touch
he
laid
on
her
hand
they
looked
at
each
other
and
he
smiled
and
said
there
are
to
be
no
more
obstacles
obstacles
the
word
startled
her
what
obstacles
don
t
you
remember
the
wording
of
the
telegram
that
turned
me
back
last
may
unforeseen
obstacle
that
was
it
what
was
the
problem
by
the
way
finding
a
governess
for
effie
wasn
t
it
but
i
gave
you
my
reason
the
reason
why
it
was
an
obstacle
i
wrote
you
fully
about
yes
i
know
you
he
lifted
her
hand
and
kissed
it
how
far
off
it
all
seems
and
how
little
it
all
matters
today
she
looked
at
him
quickly
do
you
feel
that
i
suppose
i
m
different
i
want
to
draw
all
those
wasted
months
into
today
to
make
them
a
part
of
but
they
are
to
me
you
reach
back
and
take
everything
back
to
the
first
days
of
she
frowned
a
little
as
if
struggling
with
an
inarticulate
perplexity
it
s
curious
how
in
those
first
days
too
something
that
i
didn
t
understand
came
between
oh
in
those
days
we
neither
of
us
understood
did
we
it
s
part
of
what
s
called
the
bliss
of
being
yes
i
thought
that
too
thought
it
i
mean
in
looking
back
but
it
couldn
t
even
then
have
been
as
true
of
you
as
of
me
and
now
now
he
said
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
that
we
re
sitting
here
he
dismissed
the
rest
with
a
lightness
that
might
have
seemed
conclusive
evidence
of
her
power
over
him
but
she
took
no
pride
in
such
triumphs
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
wanted
his
allegiance
and
his
adoration
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
their
mutual
love
and
that
in
treating
lightly
any
past
phase
of
their
relation
he
took
something
from
its
present
beauty
the
colour
rose
to
her
face
between
you
and
me
everything
of
course
she
felt
the
unperceiving
sweetness
of
his
smile
that
s
why
he
went
on
everything
for
me
is
here
and
now
on
this
bench
between
you
and
she
caught
at
the
phrase
that
s
what
i
meant
it
s
here
and
now
we
can
t
get
away
from
get
away
from
it
do
you
want
to
again
her
heart
was
beating
unsteadily
something
in
her
fitfully
and
with
reluctance
struggled
to
free
itself
but
the
warmth
of
his
nearness
penetrated
every
sense
as
the
sunlight
steeped
the
landscape
then
suddenly
she
felt
that
she
wanted
no
less
than
the
whole
of
her
happiness
again
but
wasn
t
it
you
the
last
time
she
paused
the
tremor
in
her
of
psyche
holding
up
the
lamp
but
in
the
interrogative
light
of
her
pause
her
companion
s
features
underwent
no
change
the
last
time
last
spring
but
it
was
you
who
for
the
best
of
reasons
as
you
ve
told
me
turned
me
back
from
your
very
door
last
spring
she
saw
that
he
was
ready
to
thresh
out
for
her
sentimental
satisfaction
a
question
which
for
his
own
time
had
so
conclusively
dealt
with
and
the
sense
of
his
readiness
reassured
her
i
wrote
as
soon
as
i
could
she
rejoined
i
explained
the
delay
and
asked
you
to
come
and
you
never
even
answered
my
it
was
impossible
to
come
then
i
had
to
go
back
to
my
and
impossible
to
write
and
tell
me
so
your
letter
was
a
long
time
coming
i
had
waited
a
week
ten
days
i
had
some
excuse
for
thinking
when
it
came
that
you
were
in
no
great
hurry
for
an
you
thought
that
really
after
reading
it
i
thought
her
heart
leaped
up
to
her
throat
then
why
are
you
here
today
he
turned
on
her
with
a
quick
look
of
wonder
god
knows
if
you
can
ask
me
that
you
see
i
was
right
to
say
i
didn
t
he
stood
up
abruptly
and
stood
facing
her
blocking
the
view
over
the
river
and
the
checkered
slopes
perhaps
i
might
say
so
no
no
we
must
neither
of
us
have
any
reason
for
saying
it
she
looked
at
him
gravely
surely
you
and
i
needn
t
arrange
the
lights
before
we
show
ourselves
to
each
other
i
want
you
to
see
me
just
as
i
am
with
all
my
irrational
doubts
and
scruples
the
old
ones
and
the
new
ones
he
came
back
to
his
seat
beside
her
never
mind
the
old
ones
they
were
justified
i
m
willing
to
admit
it
with
the
governess
having
suddenly
to
be
packed
off
and
effie
on
your
hands
and
your
ill
i
see
the
impossibility
of
your
letting
me
come
i
even
see
that
at
the
moment
it
was
difficult
to
write
and
explain
but
what
does
all
that
matter
now
the
new
scruples
are
the
ones
i
want
to
again
her
heart
trembled
she
felt
her
happiness
so
near
so
sure
that
to
strain
it
closer
might
be
like
a
child
s
crushing
a
pet
bird
in
its
caress
but
her
very
security
urged
her
on
for
so
long
her
doubts
had
been
now
they
had
turned
into
bright
harmless
toys
that
she
could
toss
and
catch
without
peril
you
didn
t
come
and
you
didn
t
answer
my
letter
and
after
waiting
four
months
i
wrote
and
i
answered
that
one
and
i
m
she
held
his
eyes
but
in
my
last
letter
i
repeated
exactly
what
i
d
said
in
the
first
the
one
i
wrote
you
last
june
i
told
you
then
that
i
was
ready
to
give
you
the
answer
to
what
you
d
asked
me
in
london
and
in
telling
you
that
i
told
you
what
the
answer
my
dearest
my
dearest
darrow
murmured
you
ignored
that
letter
all
summer
you
made
no
sign
and
all
i
ask
now
is
that
you
should
frankly
tell
me
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
ve
just
said
i
was
hurt
and
unhappy
and
i
doubted
you
i
suppose
if
i
d
cared
less
i
should
have
been
more
confident
i
cared
so
much
that
i
couldn
t
risk
another
failure
for
you
d
made
me
feel
that
i
d
miserably
failed
so
i
shut
my
eyes
and
set
my
teeth
and
turned
my
back
there
s
the
whole
pusillanimous
truth
of
it
oh
if
it
s
the
whole
truth
she
let
him
clasp
her
there
s
my
torment
you
see
i
thought
that
was
what
your
silence
meant
till
i
made
you
break
it
now
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
was
what
can
i
tell
you
to
make
you
sure
you
can
let
me
tell
you
everything
she
drew
away
but
without
taking
her
hands
from
him
owen
saw
you
in
paris
she
began
she
looked
at
him
and
he
faced
her
steadily
the
light
was
full
on
his
face
his
grey
eyes
his
frank
white
forehead
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
in
a
setting
of
twisted
silver
on
the
hand
he
had
kept
on
hers
in
paris
oh
yes
so
he
he
came
back
and
told
me
i
think
you
talked
to
him
a
moment
in
a
theatre
i
asked
if
you
d
spoken
of
my
having
put
you
off
or
if
you
d
sent
me
any
message
he
didn
t
remember
that
you
in
a
crush
in
a
paris
foyer
my
dear
it
was
absurd
of
me
but
owen
and
i
have
always
been
on
odd
kind
of
terms
i
think
he
guessed
about
us
when
he
saw
you
with
me
in
london
so
he
teased
me
a
little
and
tried
to
make
me
curious
about
you
and
when
he
saw
he
d
succeeded
he
told
me
he
hadn
t
had
time
to
say
much
to
you
because
you
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
the
lady
you
were
he
still
held
her
hands
but
she
felt
no
tremor
in
his
and
the
blood
did
not
stir
in
his
brown
cheek
he
seemed
to
be
honestly
turning
over
his
memories
yes
and
what
else
did
he
tell
you
oh
not
much
except
that
she
was
awfully
pretty
when
i
asked
him
to
describe
her
he
said
you
had
her
tucked
away
in
a
baignoire
and
he
hadn
t
actually
seen
her
but
he
saw
the
tail
of
her
cloak
and
somehow
knew
from
that
that
she
was
pretty
one
does
you
know
i
think
he
said
the
cloak
was
darrow
broke
into
a
laugh
of
course
it
was
they
always
are
so
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
your
doubts
not
at
first
i
only
laughed
but
afterward
when
i
wrote
you
and
you
didn
t
answer
oh
you
do
see
she
appealed
to
him
he
was
looking
at
her
gently
yes
i
it
s
not
as
if
this
were
a
light
thing
between
us
i
want
you
to
know
me
as
i
am
if
i
thought
that
at
that
moment
when
you
were
on
your
way
here
almost
he
dropped
her
hand
and
stood
up
yes
yes
i
but
do
you
her
look
followed
him
i
m
not
a
goose
of
a
girl
i
know
of
course
i
know
but
there
are
things
a
woman
feels
when
what
she
knows
doesn
t
make
any
difference
it
s
not
that
i
want
you
to
explain
i
mean
about
that
particular
evening
it
s
only
that
i
want
you
to
have
the
whole
of
my
feeling
i
didn
t
know
what
it
was
till
i
saw
you
again
i
never
dreamed
i
should
say
such
things
to
you
i
never
dreamed
i
should
be
here
to
hear
you
say
them
he
turned
back
and
lifting
a
floating
end
of
her
scarf
put
his
lips
to
it
but
now
that
you
have
i
know
i
know
he
smiled
down
at
her
you
know
that
this
is
no
light
thing
between
us
now
you
may
ask
me
anything
you
please
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
ask
for
a
long
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
without
speaking
she
saw
the
dancing
spirit
in
his
eyes
turn
grave
and
darken
to
a
passionate
sternness
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
and
she
sat
as
if
folded
in
wings
xii
it
was
in
the
natural
order
of
things
that
on
the
way
back
to
the
house
their
talk
should
have
turned
to
the
future
anna
was
not
eager
to
define
it
she
had
an
extraordinary
sensitiveness
to
the
impalpable
elements
of
happiness
and
as
she
walked
at
darrow
s
side
her
imagination
flew
back
and
forth
spinning
luminous
webs
of
feeling
between
herself
and
the
scene
about
her
every
heightening
of
emotion
produced
for
her
a
new
effusion
of
beauty
in
visible
things
and
with
it
the
sense
that
such
moments
should
be
lingered
over
and
absorbed
like
some
unrenewable
miracle
she
understood
darrow
s
impatience
to
see
their
plans
take
shape
she
knew
it
must
be
so
she
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
but
to
reach
a
point
where
she
could
fix
her
mind
on
his
appeal
for
dates
and
decisions
was
like
trying
to
break
her
way
through
the
silver
tangle
of
an
april
wood
darrow
wished
to
use
his
diplomatic
opportunities
as
a
means
of
studying
certain
economic
and
social
problems
with
which
he
presently
hoped
to
deal
in
print
and
with
this
in
view
he
had
asked
for
and
obtained
a
south
american
appointment
anna
was
ready
to
follow
where
he
led
and
not
reluctant
to
put
new
sights
as
well
as
new
thoughts
between
herself
and
her
past
she
had
in
a
direct
way
only
effie
and
effie
s
education
to
consider
and
there
seemed
after
due
reflection
no
reason
why
the
most
anxious
regard
for
these
should
not
be
conciliated
with
the
demands
of
darrow
s
career
effie
it
was
evident
could
be
left
to
madame
de
chantelle
s
care
till
the
couple
should
have
organized
their
life
and
she
might
even
as
long
as
her
future
s
work
retained
him
in
distant
posts
continue
to
divide
her
year
between
givre
and
the
antipodes
as
for
owen
who
had
reached
his
legal
majority
two
years
before
and
was
soon
to
attain
the
age
fixed
for
the
taking
over
of
his
paternal
inheritance
the
arrival
of
this
date
would
reduce
his
s
responsibility
to
a
friendly
concern
for
his
welfare
this
made
for
the
prompt
realization
of
darrow
s
wishes
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
the
marriage
should
not
take
place
within
the
six
weeks
that
remained
of
his
leave
they
passed
out
of
the
into
the
open
brightness
of
the
garden
the
noon
sunlight
sheeted
with
gold
the
bronze
flanks
of
the
polygonal
yews
chrysanthemums
russet
saffron
and
orange
glowed
like
the
efflorescence
of
an
enchanted
forest
belts
of
red
begonia
purpling
to
ran
like
smouldering
flame
among
the
borders
and
above
this
outspread
tapestry
the
house
extended
its
harmonious
length
the
soberness
of
its
lines
softened
to
grace
in
the
luminous
misty
air
darrow
stood
still
and
anna
felt
that
his
glance
was
travelling
from
her
to
the
scene
about
them
and
then
back
to
her
face
you
re
sure
you
re
prepared
to
give
up
givre
you
look
so
made
for
each
other
oh
givre
she
broke
off
suddenly
feeling
as
if
her
too
careless
tone
had
delivered
all
her
past
into
his
hands
and
with
one
of
her
instinctive
movements
of
recoil
she
added
when
owen
marries
i
shall
have
to
give
it
when
owen
marries
that
s
looking
some
distance
ahead
i
want
to
be
told
that
meanwhile
you
ll
have
no
she
hesitated
why
did
he
press
her
to
uncover
to
him
her
poor
starved
past
a
vague
feeling
of
loyalty
a
desire
to
spare
what
could
no
longer
harm
her
made
her
answer
evasively
there
will
probably
be
no
owen
may
marry
before
she
had
not
meant
to
touch
on
the
subject
for
her
had
sworn
her
to
provisional
secrecy
but
since
the
shortness
of
darrow
s
leave
necessitated
a
prompt
adjustment
of
their
own
plans
it
was
after
all
inevitable
that
she
should
give
him
at
least
a
hint
of
owen
s
owen
marry
why
he
always
seems
like
a
faun
in
flannels
i
hope
he
s
found
a
dryad
there
might
easily
be
one
left
in
these
i
can
t
tell
you
yet
where
he
found
his
dryad
but
she
is
one
i
believe
at
any
rate
she
ll
become
the
givre
woods
better
than
i
do
only
there
may
be
difficulties
well
at
that
age
they
re
not
always
to
be
wished
she
hesitated
owen
at
any
rate
has
made
up
his
mind
to
overcome
them
and
i
ve
promised
to
see
him
she
went
on
after
a
moment
s
consideration
to
explain
that
her
s
choice
was
for
various
reasons
not
likely
to
commend
itself
to
his
grandmother
she
must
be
prepared
for
it
and
i
ve
promised
to
do
the
preparing
you
know
i
always
have
seen
him
through
things
and
he
rather
counts
on
me
she
fancied
that
darrow
s
exclamation
had
in
it
a
faint
note
of
annoyance
and
wondered
if
he
again
suspected
her
of
seeking
a
pretext
for
postponement
but
once
owen
s
future
is
settled
you
won
t
surely
for
the
sake
of
what
you
call
seeing
him
through
ask
that
i
should
go
away
again
without
you
he
drew
her
closer
as
they
walked
owen
will
understand
if
you
don
t
since
he
s
in
the
same
case
himself
i
ll
throw
myself
on
his
mercy
he
ll
see
that
i
have
the
first
claim
on
you
he
won
t
even
want
you
not
to
see
owen
sees
everything
i
m
not
afraid
of
that
but
his
future
isn
t
settled
he
s
very
young
to
marry
too
young
his
grandmother
is
sure
to
think
and
the
marriage
he
wants
to
make
is
not
likely
to
convince
her
to
the
you
don
t
mean
that
it
s
like
his
first
choice
oh
no
but
it
s
not
what
madame
de
chantelle
would
call
a
good
match
it
s
not
even
what
i
call
a
wise
yet
you
re
backing
him
up
yet
i
m
backing
him
she
paused
i
wonder
if
you
ll
understand
what
i
ve
most
wanted
for
him
and
shall
want
for
effie
is
that
they
shall
always
feel
free
to
make
their
own
mistakes
and
never
if
possible
be
persuaded
to
make
other
people
s
even
if
owen
s
marriage
is
a
mistake
and
has
to
be
paid
for
i
believe
he
ll
learn
and
grow
in
the
paying
of
course
i
can
t
make
madame
de
chantelle
see
this
but
i
can
remind
her
that
with
his
character
his
big
rushes
of
impulse
his
odd
intervals
of
ebb
and
apathy
she
may
drive
him
into
some
worse
blunder
if
she
thwarts
him
and
you
mean
to
break
the
news
to
her
as
soon
as
she
comes
back
from
ouchy
as
soon
as
i
see
my
way
to
it
she
knows
the
girl
and
likes
her
that
s
our
hope
and
yet
it
may
in
the
end
prove
our
danger
make
it
harder
for
us
all
when
she
learns
the
truth
than
if
owen
had
chosen
a
stranger
i
can
t
tell
you
more
till
i
ve
told
her
i
ve
promised
owen
not
to
tell
any
one
all
i
ask
you
is
to
give
me
time
to
give
me
a
few
days
at
any
rate
she
s
been
wonderfully
nice
as
she
would
call
it
about
you
and
about
the
fact
of
my
having
soon
to
leave
givre
but
that
again
may
make
it
harder
for
owen
at
any
rate
you
can
see
can
t
you
how
it
makes
me
want
to
stand
by
him
you
see
i
couldn
t
bear
it
if
the
least
fraction
of
my
happiness
seemed
to
be
stolen
from
his
as
if
it
were
a
little
scrap
of
happiness
that
had
to
be
pieced
out
with
other
people
s
she
clasped
her
hands
on
darrow
s
arm
i
want
our
life
to
be
like
a
house
with
all
the
windows
lit
i
d
like
to
string
lanterns
from
the
roof
and
chimneys
she
ended
with
an
inward
tremor
all
through
her
exposition
and
her
appeal
she
had
told
herself
that
the
moment
could
hardly
have
been
less
well
chosen
in
darrow
s
place
she
would
have
felt
as
he
doubtless
did
that
her
carefully
developed
argument
was
only
the
disguise
of
an
habitual
indecision
it
was
the
hour
of
all
others
when
she
would
have
liked
to
affirm
herself
by
brushing
aside
every
obstacle
to
his
wishes
yet
it
was
only
by
opposing
them
that
she
could
show
the
strength
of
character
she
wanted
him
to
feel
in
her
but
as
she
talked
she
began
to
see
that
darrow
s
face
gave
back
no
reflection
of
her
words
that
he
continued
to
wear
the
abstracted
look
of
a
man
who
is
not
listening
to
what
is
said
to
him
it
caused
her
a
slight
pang
to
discover
that
his
thoughts
could
wander
at
such
a
moment
then
with
a
flush
of
joy
she
perceived
the
reason
in
some
undefinable
way
she
had
become
aware
without
turning
her
head
that
he
was
steeped
in
the
sense
of
her
nearness
absorbed
in
contemplating
the
details
of
her
face
and
dress
and
the
discovery
made
the
words
throng
to
her
lips
she
felt
herself
speak
with
ease
authority
conviction
she
said
to
herself
he
doesn
t
care
what
i
say
it
s
enough
that
i
say
it
even
if
it
s
stupid
he
ll
like
me
better
for
it
she
knew
that
every
inflexion
of
her
voice
every
gesture
every
characteristic
of
her
person
its
very
defects
the
fact
that
her
forehead
was
too
high
that
her
eyes
were
not
large
enough
that
her
hands
though
slender
were
not
small
and
that
the
fingers
did
not
taper
she
knew
that
these
deficiencies
were
so
many
channels
through
which
her
influence
streamed
to
him
that
she
pleased
him
in
spite
of
them
perhaps
because
of
them
that
he
wanted
her
as
she
was
and
not
as
she
would
have
liked
to
be
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
in
her
veins
the
security
and
lightness
of
happy
love
they
reached
the
court
and
walked
under
the
limes
toward
the
house
the
hall
door
stood
wide
and
through
the
windows
opening
on
the
terrace
the
sun
slanted
across
the
black
and
white
floor
the
faded
tapestry
chairs
and
darrow
s
travelling
coat
and
cap
which
lay
among
the
cloaks
and
rugs
piled
on
a
bench
against
the
wall
the
sight
of
these
garments
lying
among
her
own
wraps
gave
her
a
sense
of
homely
intimacy
it
was
as
if
her
happiness
came
down
from
the
skies
and
took
on
the
plain
dress
of
daily
things
at
last
she
seemed
to
hold
it
in
her
hand
as
they
entered
the
hall
her
eye
lit
on
an
unstamped
note
conspicuously
placed
on
the
table
from
owen
he
must
have
rushed
off
somewhere
in
the
she
felt
a
secret
stir
of
pleasure
at
the
immediate
inference
that
she
and
darrow
would
probably
lunch
alone
then
she
opened
the
note
and
stared
at
it
in
wonder
dear
owen
wrote
after
what
you
said
yesterday
i
can
t
wait
another
hour
and
i
m
off
to
francheuil
to
catch
the
dijon
express
and
travel
back
with
them
don
t
be
frightened
i
won
t
speak
unless
it
s
safe
to
trust
me
for
that
but
i
had
to
she
looked
up
slowly
he
s
gone
to
dijon
to
meet
his
grandmother
oh
i
hope
i
haven
t
made
a
mistake
you
why
what
have
you
to
do
with
his
going
to
dijon
she
hesitated
the
day
before
yesterday
i
told
him
for
the
first
time
that
i
meant
to
see
him
through
no
matter
what
happened
and
i
m
afraid
he
s
lost
his
head
and
will
be
imprudent
and
spoil
things
you
see
i
hadn
t
meant
to
say
a
word
to
him
till
i
d
had
time
to
prepare
madame
de
she
felt
that
darrow
was
looking
at
her
and
reading
her
thoughts
and
the
colour
flew
to
her
face
yes
it
was
when
i
heard
you
were
coming
that
i
told
him
i
wanted
him
to
feel
as
i
felt
it
seemed
too
unkind
to
make
him
wait
her
hand
was
in
his
and
his
arm
rested
for
a
moment
on
her
shoulder
it
would
have
been
too
unkind
to
make
him
they
moved
side
by
side
toward
the
stairs
through
the
haze
of
bliss
enveloping
her
owen
s
affairs
seemed
curiously
unimportant
and
remote
nothing
really
mattered
but
this
torrent
of
light
in
her
veins
she
put
her
foot
on
the
lowest
step
saying
it
s
nearly
luncheon
time
i
must
take
off
my
hat
and
as
she
started
up
the
stairs
darrow
stood
below
in
the
hall
and
watched
her
but
the
distance
between
them
did
not
make
him
seem
less
near
it
was
as
if
his
thoughts
moved
with
her
and
touched
her
like
endearing
hands
in
her
bedroom
she
shut
the
door
and
stood
still
looking
about
her
in
a
fit
of
dreamy
wonder
her
feelings
were
unlike
any
she
had
ever
known
richer
deeper
more
complete
for
the
first
time
everything
in
her
from
head
to
foot
seemed
to
be
feeding
the
same
full
current
of
sensation
she
took
off
her
hat
and
went
to
the
to
smooth
her
hair
the
pressure
of
the
hat
had
flattened
the
dark
strands
on
her
forehead
her
face
was
paler
than
usual
with
shadows
about
the
eyes
she
felt
a
pang
of
regret
for
the
wasted
years
if
i
look
like
this
today
she
said
to
herself
what
will
he
think
of
me
when
i
m
ill
or
worried
she
began
to
run
her
fingers
through
her
hair
rejoicing
in
its
thickness
then
she
desisted
and
sat
still
resting
her
chin
on
her
hands
i
want
him
to
see
me
as
i
am
she
thought
deeper
than
the
deepest
fibre
of
her
vanity
was
the
triumphant
sense
that
as
she
was
with
her
flattened
hair
her
tired
pallor
her
thin
sleeves
a
little
tumbled
by
the
weight
of
her
jacket
he
would
like
her
even
better
feel
her
nearer
dearer
more
desirable
than
in
all
the
splendours
she
might
put
on
for
him
in
the
light
of
this
discovery
she
studied
her
face
with
a
new
intentness
seeing
its
defects
as
she
had
never
seen
them
yet
seeing
them
through
a
kind
of
radiance
as
though
love
were
a
luminous
medium
into
which
she
had
been
bodily
plunged
she
was
glad
now
that
she
had
confessed
her
doubts
and
her
jealousy
she
divined
that
a
man
in
love
may
be
flattered
by
such
involuntary
betrayals
that
there
are
moments
when
respect
for
his
liberty
appeals
to
him
less
than
the
inability
to
respect
it
moments
so
propitious
that
a
woman
s
very
mistakes
and
indiscretions
may
help
to
establish
her
dominion
the
sense
of
power
she
had
been
aware
of
in
talking
to
darrow
came
back
with
force
she
felt
like
testing
him
by
the
most
fantastic
exactions
and
at
the
same
moment
she
longed
to
humble
herself
before
him
to
make
herself
the
shadow
and
echo
of
his
mood
she
wanted
to
linger
with
him
in
a
world
of
fancy
and
yet
to
walk
at
his
side
in
the
world
of
fact
she
wanted
him
to
feel
her
power
and
yet
to
love
her
for
her
ignorance
and
humility
she
felt
like
a
slave
and
a
goddess
and
a
girl
in
her
teens
xiii
darrow
late
that
evening
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
before
his
fire
and
mused
the
room
was
propitious
to
meditation
the
lamp
the
corners
of
shadow
the
splashes
of
firelight
on
the
curves
of
old
wardrobes
and
cabinets
gave
it
an
air
of
intimacy
increased
by
its
faded
hangings
its
slightly
frayed
and
threadbare
rugs
everything
in
it
was
harmoniously
shabby
with
a
subtle
shabbiness
in
which
darrow
fancied
he
discerned
the
touch
of
fraser
leath
but
fraser
leath
had
grown
so
unimportant
a
factor
in
the
scheme
of
things
that
these
marks
of
his
presence
caused
the
young
man
no
emotion
beyond
that
of
a
faint
retrospective
amusement
the
afternoon
and
evening
had
been
perfect
after
a
moment
of
concern
over
her
s
departure
anna
had
surrendered
herself
to
her
happiness
with
an
impetuosity
that
darrow
had
never
suspected
in
her
early
in
the
afternoon
they
had
gone
out
in
the
motor
traversing
miles
of
landscape
in
which
here
and
there
a
scarlet
vineyard
flamed
clattering
through
the
streets
of
stony
villages
coming
out
on
low
slopes
above
the
river
or
winding
through
the
pale
gold
of
narrow
with
the
blue
of
hills
at
their
end
over
everything
lay
a
faint
sunshine
that
seemed
dissolved
in
the
still
air
and
the
smell
of
wet
roots
and
decaying
leaves
was
merged
in
the
pungent
scent
of
burning
underbrush
once
at
the
turn
of
a
wall
they
stopped
the
motor
before
a
ruined
gateway
and
stumbling
along
a
road
full
of
ruts
stood
before
a
little
old
deserted
house
fantastically
carved
and
chimneyed
which
lay
in
a
moat
under
the
shade
of
ancient
trees
they
paced
the
paths
between
the
trees
found
a
mouldy
temple
of
love
on
an
islet
among
reeds
and
plantains
and
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
watched
the
pigeons
circling
against
the
sunset
over
their
cot
of
patterned
brick
then
the
motor
flew
on
into
the
dusk
when
they
came
in
they
sat
beside
the
fire
in
the
oak
and
darrow
noticed
how
delicately
her
head
stood
out
against
the
sombre
panelling
and
mused
on
the
enjoyment
there
would
always
be
in
the
mere
fact
of
watching
her
hands
as
they
moved
about
among
the
they
dined
late
and
facing
her
across
the
table
with
its
low
lights
and
flowers
he
felt
an
extraordinary
pleasure
in
seeing
her
again
in
evening
dress
and
in
letting
his
eyes
dwell
on
the
proud
shy
set
of
her
head
the
way
her
dark
hair
clasped
it
and
the
girlish
thinness
of
her
neck
above
the
slight
swell
of
the
breast
his
imagination
was
struck
by
the
quality
of
reticence
in
her
beauty
she
suggested
a
fine
portrait
kept
down
to
a
few
tones
or
a
greek
vase
on
which
the
play
of
light
is
the
only
pattern
after
dinner
they
went
out
on
the
terrace
for
a
look
at
the
park
through
the
crepuscular
whiteness
the
trees
hung
in
blotted
masses
below
the
terrace
the
garden
drew
its
dark
diagrams
between
statues
that
stood
like
muffled
conspirators
on
the
edge
of
the
shadow
farther
off
the
meadows
unrolled
a
tissue
to
the
mantling
of
mist
above
the
river
and
the
autumn
stars
trembled
overhead
like
their
own
reflections
seen
in
dim
water
he
lit
his
cigar
and
they
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
flags
in
the
languid
air
till
he
put
an
arm
about
her
saying
you
mustn
t
stay
till
you
re
chilled
then
they
went
back
into
the
room
and
drew
up
their
chairs
to
the
fire
it
seemed
only
a
moment
later
that
she
said
it
must
be
after
eleven
and
stood
up
and
looked
down
on
him
smiling
faintly
he
sat
still
absorbing
the
look
and
thinking
there
ll
be
evenings
and
evenings
till
she
came
nearer
bent
over
him
and
with
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
said
good
he
got
to
his
feet
and
put
his
arms
about
her
good
night
he
answered
and
held
her
fast
and
they
gave
each
other
a
long
kiss
of
promise
and
communion
the
memory
of
it
glowed
in
him
still
as
he
sat
over
his
crumbling
fire
but
beneath
his
physical
exultation
he
felt
a
certain
gravity
of
mood
his
happiness
was
in
some
sort
the
of
many
scattered
purposes
he
summed
it
up
vaguely
by
saying
to
himself
that
to
be
loved
by
a
woman
like
that
made
all
the
difference
he
was
a
little
tired
of
experimenting
on
life
he
wanted
to
take
a
line
to
follow
things
up
to
centralize
and
concentrate
and
produce
results
two
or
three
more
years
of
diplomacy
with
her
beside
him
and
then
their
real
life
would
begin
study
travel
and
for
him
and
for
her
well
the
joy
at
any
rate
of
getting
out
of
an
atmosphere
of
and
into
the
open
air
of
competing
activities
the
desire
for
change
had
for
some
time
been
latent
in
him
and
his
meeting
with
leath
the
previous
spring
had
given
it
a
definite
direction
with
such
a
comrade
to
focus
and
stimulate
his
energies
he
felt
modestly
but
agreeably
sure
of
doing
something
and
under
this
assurance
was
the
lurking
sense
that
he
was
somehow
worthy
of
his
opportunity
his
life
on
the
whole
had
been
a
creditable
affair
out
of
modest
chances
and
middling
talents
he
had
built
himself
a
fairly
marked
personality
known
some
exceptional
people
done
a
number
of
interesting
and
a
few
rather
difficult
things
and
found
himself
at
possessed
of
an
intellectual
ambition
sufficient
to
occupy
the
passage
to
a
robust
and
energetic
old
age
as
for
the
private
and
personal
side
of
his
life
it
had
come
up
to
the
current
standards
and
if
it
had
dropped
now
and
then
below
a
more
ideal
measure
even
these
declines
had
been
brief
parenthetic
incidental
in
the
recognized
essentials
he
had
always
remained
strictly
within
the
limit
of
his
scruples
from
this
reassuring
survey
of
his
case
he
came
back
to
the
contemplation
of
its
crowning
felicity
his
mind
turned
again
to
his
first
meeting
with
anna
summers
and
took
up
one
by
one
the
threads
of
their
faintly
sketched
romance
he
dwelt
with
pardonable
pride
on
the
fact
that
fate
had
so
early
marked
him
for
the
high
privilege
of
possessing
her
it
seemed
to
mean
that
they
had
really
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
phrase
been
made
for
each
other
deeper
still
than
all
these
satisfactions
was
the
mere
elemental
sense
of
in
her
presence
that
after
all
was
what
proved
her
to
be
the
woman
for
him
the
pleasure
he
took
in
the
set
of
her
head
the
way
her
hair
grew
on
her
forehead
and
at
the
nape
her
steady
gaze
when
he
spoke
the
grave
freedom
of
her
gait
and
gestures
he
recalled
every
detail
of
her
face
the
fine
veinings
of
the
temples
the
shadows
in
her
upper
lids
and
the
way
the
reflections
of
two
stars
seemed
to
form
and
break
up
in
her
eyes
when
he
held
her
close
to
him
if
he
had
had
any
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
her
feeling
for
him
those
dissolving
stars
would
have
allayed
it
she
was
reserved
she
was
shy
even
was
what
the
shallow
and
effusive
would
call
cold
she
was
like
a
picture
so
hung
that
it
can
be
seen
only
at
a
certain
angle
an
angle
known
to
no
one
but
its
possessor
the
thought
flattered
his
sense
of
possessorship
he
felt
that
the
smile
on
his
lips
would
have
been
fatuous
had
it
had
a
witness
he
was
thinking
of
her
look
when
she
had
questioned
him
about
his
meeting
with
owen
at
the
theatre
less
of
her
words
than
of
her
look
and
of
the
effort
the
question
cost
her
the
reddening
of
her
cheek
the
deepening
of
the
strained
line
between
her
brows
the
way
her
eyes
sought
shelter
and
then
turned
and
drew
on
him
pride
and
passion
were
in
the
conflict
magnificent
qualities
in
a
wife
the
sight
almost
made
up
for
his
momentary
embarrassment
at
the
rousing
of
a
memory
which
had
no
place
in
his
present
picture
of
himself
yes
it
was
worth
a
good
deal
to
watch
that
fight
between
her
instinct
and
her
intelligence
and
know
one
s
self
the
object
of
the
struggle
mingled
with
these
sensations
were
considerations
of
another
order
he
reflected
with
satisfaction
that
she
was
the
kind
of
woman
with
whom
one
would
like
to
be
seen
in
public
it
would
be
distinctly
agreeable
to
follow
her
into
to
walk
after
her
down
the
aisle
of
a
theatre
to
get
in
and
out
of
trains
with
her
to
say
my
wife
of
her
to
all
sorts
of
people
he
draped
these
details
in
the
handsome
phrase
she
s
a
woman
to
be
proud
of
and
felt
that
this
fact
somehow
justified
and
ennobled
his
instinctive
boyish
satisfaction
in
loving
her
he
stood
up
rambled
across
the
room
and
leaned
out
for
a
while
into
the
starry
night
then
he
dropped
again
into
his
armchair
with
a
sigh
of
deep
content
oh
hang
it
he
suddenly
exclaimed
it
s
the
best
thing
that
s
ever
happened
to
me
anyhow
the
next
day
was
even
better
he
felt
and
knew
she
felt
that
they
had
reached
a
clearer
understanding
of
each
other
it
was
as
if
after
a
swim
through
bright
opposing
waves
with
a
dazzle
of
sun
in
their
eyes
they
had
gained
an
inlet
in
the
shades
of
a
cliff
where
they
could
float
on
the
still
surface
and
gaze
far
down
into
the
depths
now
and
then
as
they
walked
and
talked
he
felt
a
thrill
of
youthful
wonder
at
the
coincidence
of
their
views
and
their
experiences
at
the
way
their
minds
leapt
to
the
same
point
in
the
same
instant
the
old
delusion
i
suppose
he
smiled
to
himself
will
nature
never
tire
of
the
trick
but
he
knew
it
was
more
than
that
there
were
moments
in
their
talk
when
he
felt
distinctly
and
unmistakably
the
solid
ground
of
friendship
underneath
the
whirling
dance
of
his
sensations
how
i
should
like
her
if
i
didn
t
love
her
he
summed
it
up
wondering
at
the
miracle
of
such
a
union
in
the
course
of
the
morning
a
telegram
had
come
from
owen
leath
announcing
that
he
his
grandmother
and
effie
would
arrive
from
dijon
that
afternoon
at
four
the
station
of
the
main
line
was
eight
or
ten
miles
from
givre
and
anna
soon
after
three
left
in
the
motor
to
meet
the
travellers
when
she
had
gone
darrow
started
for
a
walk
planning
to
get
back
late
in
order
that
the
reunited
family
might
have
the
end
of
the
afternoon
to
themselves
he
roamed
the
till
long
after
dark
and
the
of
givre
was
striking
seven
as
he
walked
up
the
avenue
to
the
court
in
the
hall
coming
down
the
stairs
he
encountered
anna
her
face
was
serene
and
his
first
glance
showed
him
that
owen
had
kept
his
word
and
that
none
of
her
forebodings
had
been
fulfilled
she
had
just
come
down
from
the
where
effie
and
the
governess
were
having
supper
the
little
girl
she
told
him
looked
immensely
better
for
her
swiss
holiday
but
was
dropping
with
sleep
after
the
journey
and
too
tired
to
make
her
habitual
appearance
in
the
before
being
put
to
bed
madame
de
chantelle
was
resting
but
would
be
down
for
dinner
and
as
for
owen
anna
supposed
he
was
off
somewhere
in
the
park
he
had
a
passion
for
prowling
about
the
park
at
nightfall
darrow
followed
her
into
the
brown
room
where
the
had
been
left
for
him
he
declined
her
offer
of
tea
but
she
lingered
a
moment
to
tell
him
that
owen
had
in
fact
kept
his
word
and
that
madame
de
chantelle
had
come
back
in
the
best
of
humours
and
unsuspicious
of
the
blow
about
to
fall
she
has
enjoyed
her
month
at
ouchy
and
it
has
given
her
a
lot
to
talk
about
her
symptoms
and
the
rival
doctors
and
the
people
at
the
hotel
it
seems
she
met
your
ambassadress
there
and
lady
wantley
and
some
other
london
friends
of
yours
and
she
s
heard
what
she
calls
delightful
things
about
you
she
told
me
to
tell
you
so
she
attaches
great
importance
to
the
fact
that
your
grandmother
was
an
everard
of
albany
she
s
prepared
to
open
her
arms
to
you
i
don
t
know
whether
it
won
t
make
it
harder
for
poor
owen
the
contrast
i
mean
there
are
no
ambassadresses
or
everards
to
vouch
for
his
choice
but
you
ll
help
me
won
t
you
you
ll
help
me
to
help
him
i
ll
tell
you
the
rest
now
i
must
rush
up
and
tuck
in
effie
oh
you
ll
see
we
ll
pull
it
off
for
him
he
assured
her
together
we
can
t
fail
to
pull
it
he
stood
and
watched
her
with
a
smile
as
she
fled
down
the
vista
to
the
hall
xiv
if
darrow
on
entering
the
before
dinner
examined
its
new
occupant
with
unusual
interest
it
was
more
on
owen
leath
s
account
than
his
own
anna
s
hints
had
roused
his
interest
in
the
lad
s
love
affair
and
he
wondered
what
manner
of
girl
the
heroine
of
the
coming
conflict
might
be
he
had
guessed
that
owen
s
rebellion
symbolized
for
his
her
own
long
struggle
against
the
leath
conventions
and
he
understood
that
if
anna
so
passionately
abetted
him
it
was
partly
because
as
she
owned
she
wanted
his
liberation
to
coincide
with
hers
the
lady
who
was
to
represent
in
the
impending
struggle
the
forces
of
order
and
tradition
was
seated
by
the
fire
when
darrow
entered
among
the
flowers
and
old
furniture
of
the
large
room
madame
de
chantelle
had
the
inanimate
elegance
of
a
figure
introduced
into
a
to
give
the
scale
and
this
darrow
reflected
was
exactly
what
she
doubtless
regarded
as
her
chief
obligation
he
was
sure
she
thought
a
great
deal
of
measure
and
approved
of
most
things
only
up
to
a
certain
point
she
was
a
woman
of
sixty
with
a
figure
at
once
young
and
her
fair
faded
tints
her
quaint
corseting
the
passementerie
on
her
dress
the
velvet
band
on
her
tapering
arm
made
her
resemble
a
carte
de
visite
photograph
of
the
middle
sixties
one
saw
her
younger
but
no
less
invincibly
leaning
on
a
chair
with
a
fringed
back
a
curl
in
her
neck
a
locket
on
her
tuckered
bosom
toward
the
end
of
an
embossed
morocco
album
beginning
with
the
beauties
of
the
second
empire
she
received
her
s
suitor
with
an
affability
which
implied
her
knowledge
and
approval
of
his
suit
darrow
had
already
guessed
her
to
be
a
person
who
would
instinctively
oppose
any
suggested
changes
and
then
after
one
had
exhausted
one
s
main
arguments
unexpectedly
yield
to
some
small
incidental
reason
and
adhere
doggedly
to
her
new
position
she
boasted
of
her
prejudices
talked
a
good
deal
of
being
a
grandmother
and
made
a
show
of
reaching
up
to
tap
owen
s
shoulder
though
his
height
was
little
more
than
hers
she
was
full
of
a
small
pale
prattle
about
the
people
she
had
seen
at
ouchy
as
to
whom
she
had
the
minute
statistical
information
of
a
gazetteer
without
any
apparent
sense
of
personal
differences
she
said
to
darrow
they
tell
me
things
are
very
much
changed
in
america
of
course
in
my
youth
there
was
a
society
she
had
no
desire
to
return
there
she
was
sure
the
standards
must
be
so
different
there
are
charming
people
everywhere
and
one
must
always
look
on
the
best
side
but
when
one
has
lived
among
traditions
it
s
difficult
to
adapt
one
s
self
to
the
new
ideas
these
dreadful
views
of
marriage
it
s
so
hard
to
explain
them
to
my
french
relations
i
m
thankful
to
say
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
them
myself
but
you
re
an
everard
i
told
anna
last
spring
in
london
that
one
sees
that
instantly
she
wandered
off
to
the
cooking
and
the
service
of
the
hotel
at
ouchy
she
attached
great
importance
to
gastronomic
details
and
to
the
manners
of
hotel
servants
there
too
there
was
a
falling
off
she
said
i
don
t
know
of
course
but
people
say
it
s
owing
to
the
americans
certainly
my
waiter
had
a
way
of
slapping
down
the
dishes
they
tell
me
that
many
of
them
are
anarchists
belong
to
unions
you
she
appealed
to
darrow
s
reported
knowledge
of
economic
conditions
to
confirm
this
ominous
rumour
after
dinner
owen
leath
wandered
into
the
next
room
where
the
piano
stood
and
began
to
play
among
the
shadows
his
presently
joined
him
and
darrow
sat
alone
with
madame
de
chantelle
she
took
up
the
thread
of
her
mild
chat
and
carried
it
on
at
the
same
pace
as
her
knitting
her
conversation
resembled
the
large
web
between
her
fingers
now
and
then
she
dropped
a
stitch
and
went
on
regardless
of
the
gap
in
the
pattern
darrow
listened
with
a
lazy
sense
of
in
the
mental
lull
of
the
hour
with
harmonious
memories
murmuring
through
his
mind
and
the
soft
tints
and
shadowy
spaces
of
the
fine
old
room
charming
his
eyes
to
indolence
madame
de
chantelle
s
discourse
seemed
not
out
of
place
he
could
understand
that
in
the
long
run
the
atmosphere
of
givre
might
be
suffocating
but
in
his
present
mood
its
very
limitations
had
a
grace
presently
he
found
the
chance
to
say
a
word
in
his
own
behalf
and
thereupon
measured
the
advantage
never
before
particularly
apparent
to
him
of
being
related
to
the
everards
of
albany
madame
de
chantelle
s
conception
of
her
native
country
to
which
she
had
not
returned
since
her
twentieth
year
reminded
him
of
an
ancient
geographer
s
map
of
the
hyperborean
regions
it
was
all
a
foggy
blank
from
which
only
one
or
two
fixed
outlines
emerged
and
one
of
these
belonged
to
the
everards
of
albany
the
fact
that
they
offered
such
firm
footing
formed
so
to
speak
a
friendly
territory
on
which
the
opposing
powers
could
meet
and
treat
helped
him
through
the
task
of
explaining
and
justifying
himself
as
the
successor
of
fraser
leath
madame
de
chantelle
could
not
resist
such
incontestable
claims
she
seemed
to
feel
her
son
s
hovering
and
discriminating
presence
and
she
gave
darrow
the
sense
that
he
was
being
tested
and
approved
as
a
last
addition
to
the
leath
collection
she
also
made
him
aware
of
the
immense
advantage
he
possessed
in
belonging
to
the
diplomatic
profession
she
spoke
of
this
humdrum
calling
as
a
career
and
gave
darrow
to
understand
that
she
supposed
him
to
have
been
seducing
duchesses
when
he
was
not
negotiating
treaties
he
heard
again
quaint
phrases
which
romantic
old
ladies
had
used
in
his
youth
brilliant
diplomatic
society
social
advantages
the
entree
everywhere
nothing
else
forms
a
young
man
in
the
same
way
and
she
sighingly
added
that
she
could
have
wished
her
grandson
had
chosen
the
same
path
to
glory
darrow
prudently
suppressed
his
own
view
of
the
profession
as
well
as
the
fact
that
he
had
adopted
it
provisionally
and
for
reasons
less
social
than
sociological
and
the
talk
presently
passed
on
to
the
subject
of
his
future
plans
here
again
madame
de
chantelle
s
awe
of
the
career
made
her
admit
the
necessity
of
anna
s
consenting
to
an
early
marriage
the
fact
that
darrow
was
ordered
to
south
america
seemed
to
put
him
in
the
romantic
light
of
a
young
soldier
charged
to
lead
a
forlorn
hope
she
sighed
and
said
at
such
moments
a
wife
s
duty
is
at
her
husband
s
the
problem
of
effie
s
future
might
have
disturbed
her
she
added
but
since
anna
for
a
time
consented
to
leave
the
little
girl
with
her
that
problem
was
at
any
rate
deferred
she
spoke
plaintively
of
the
responsibility
of
looking
after
her
granddaughter
but
darrow
divined
that
she
enjoyed
the
flavour
of
the
word
more
than
she
felt
the
weight
of
the
fact
effie
s
a
perfect
child
she
s
more
like
my
son
perhaps
than
dear
owen
she
ll
never
intentionally
give
me
the
least
trouble
but
of
course
the
responsibility
will
be
great
i
m
not
sure
i
should
dare
to
undertake
it
if
it
were
not
for
her
having
such
a
treasure
of
a
governess
has
anna
told
you
about
our
little
governess
after
all
the
worry
we
had
last
year
with
one
impossible
creature
after
another
it
seems
providential
just
now
to
have
found
her
at
first
we
were
afraid
she
was
too
young
but
now
we
ve
the
greatest
confidence
in
her
so
clever
and
amusing
and
such
a
lady
i
don
t
say
her
education
s
all
it
might
be
no
drawing
or
singing
but
one
can
t
have
everything
and
she
speaks
italian
madame
de
chantelle
s
fond
insistence
on
the
likeness
between
effie
leath
and
her
father
if
not
particularly
gratifying
to
darrow
had
at
least
increased
his
desire
to
see
the
little
girl
it
gave
him
an
odd
feeling
of
discomfort
to
think
that
she
should
have
any
of
the
characteristics
of
the
late
fraser
leath
he
had
somehow
fantastically
pictured
her
as
the
mystical
offspring
of
the
early
tenderness
between
himself
and
anna
summers
his
encounter
with
effie
took
place
the
next
morning
on
the
lawn
below
the
terrace
where
he
found
her
in
the
early
sunshine
knocking
about
golf
balls
with
her
brother
almost
at
once
and
with
infinite
relief
he
saw
that
the
resemblance
of
which
madame
de
chantelle
boasted
was
mainly
external
even
that
discovery
was
slightly
distasteful
though
darrow
was
forced
to
own
that
fraser
leath
s
fairness
had
lent
itself
to
the
production
of
a
peculiarly
finished
image
of
childish
purity
but
it
was
evident
that
other
elements
had
also
gone
to
the
making
of
effie
and
that
another
spirit
sat
in
her
eyes
her
serious
handshake
her
pretty
greeting
were
worthy
of
the
leath
tradition
and
he
guessed
her
to
be
more
malleable
than
owen
more
subject
to
the
influences
of
givre
but
the
shout
with
which
she
returned
to
her
romp
had
in
it
the
note
of
her
mother
s
emancipation
he
had
begged
a
holiday
for
her
and
when
leath
appeared
he
and
she
and
the
little
girl
went
off
for
a
ramble
anna
wished
her
daughter
to
have
time
to
make
friends
with
darrow
before
learning
in
what
relation
he
was
to
stand
to
her
and
the
three
roamed
the
woods
and
fields
till
the
distant
chime
of
the
made
them
turn
back
for
luncheon
effie
who
was
attended
by
a
shaggy
terrier
had
picked
up
two
or
three
subordinate
dogs
at
the
stable
and
as
she
trotted
on
ahead
with
her
yapping
escort
anna
hung
back
to
throw
a
look
at
darrow
yes
he
answered
it
she
s
exquisite
oh
i
see
what
i
m
asking
of
you
but
she
ll
be
quite
happy
here
won
t
she
and
you
must
remember
it
won
t
be
for
long
anna
sighed
her
acquiescence
oh
she
ll
be
happy
here
it
s
her
nature
to
be
happy
she
ll
apply
herself
to
it
conscientiously
as
she
does
to
her
lessons
and
to
what
she
calls
being
good
in
a
way
you
see
that
s
just
what
worries
me
her
idea
of
being
good
is
to
please
the
person
she
s
with
she
puts
her
whole
dear
little
mind
on
it
and
so
if
ever
she
s
with
the
wrong
person
but
surely
there
s
no
danger
of
that
just
now
madame
de
chantelle
tells
me
that
you
ve
at
last
put
your
hand
on
a
perfect
governess
anna
without
answering
glanced
away
from
him
toward
her
daughter
it
s
lucky
at
any
rate
darrow
continued
that
madame
de
chantelle
thinks
her
oh
i
think
very
highly
of
her
highly
enough
to
feel
quite
satisfied
to
leave
her
with
effie
yes
she
s
just
the
person
for
effie
only
of
course
one
never
knows
she
s
young
and
she
might
take
it
into
her
head
to
leave
us
after
a
pause
she
added
i
m
naturally
anxious
to
know
what
you
think
of
when
they
entered
the
house
the
hands
of
the
hall
clock
stood
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
luncheon
hour
anna
led
effie
off
to
have
her
hair
smoothed
and
darrow
wandered
into
the
oak
which
he
found
untenanted
the
sun
lay
pleasantly
on
its
brown
walls
on
the
scattered
books
and
the
flowers
in
old
porcelain
vases
in
his
eyes
lingered
the
vision
of
the
mother
mounting
the
stairs
with
her
little
fair
daughter
the
contrast
between
them
seemed
a
last
touch
of
grace
in
the
complex
harmony
of
things
he
stood
in
the
window
looking
out
at
the
park
and
brooding
inwardly
upon
his
happiness
he
was
roused
by
effie
s
voice
and
the
scamper
of
her
feet
down
the
long
floors
behind
him
here
he
is
here
he
is
she
cried
flying
over
the
threshold
he
turned
and
stooped
to
her
with
a
smile
and
as
she
caught
his
hand
he
perceived
that
she
was
trying
to
draw
him
toward
some
one
who
had
paused
behind
her
in
the
doorway
and
whom
he
supposed
to
be
her
mother
here
he
is
effie
repeated
with
her
sweet
impatience
the
figure
in
the
doorway
came
forward
and
darrow
looking
up
found
himself
face
to
face
with
sophy
viner
they
stood
still
a
yard
or
two
apart
and
looked
at
each
other
without
speaking
as
they
paused
there
a
shadow
fell
across
one
of
the
terrace
windows
and
owen
leath
stepped
whistling
into
the
room
in
his
rough
shooting
clothes
with
the
glow
of
exercise
under
his
fair
skin
he
looked
extraordinarily
and
happy
darrow
with
a
quick
noticed
this
and
perceived
also
that
the
glow
on
the
youth
s
cheek
had
deepened
suddenly
to
red
he
too
stopped
short
and
the
three
stood
there
motionless
for
a
barely
perceptible
beat
of
time
during
its
lapse
darrow
s
eyes
had
turned
back
from
owen
s
face
to
that
of
the
girl
between
them
he
had
the
sense
that
whatever
was
done
it
was
he
who
must
do
it
and
that
it
must
be
done
immediately
he
went
forward
and
held
out
his
hand
how
do
you
do
miss
viner
she
answered
how
do
you
do
in
a
voice
that
sounded
clear
and
natural
and
the
next
moment
he
again
became
aware
of
steps
behind
him
and
knew
that
leath
was
in
the
room
to
his
strained
senses
there
seemed
to
be
another
just
measurable
pause
before
anna
said
looking
gaily
about
the
little
group
has
owen
introduced
you
this
is
effie
s
friend
miss
effie
still
hanging
on
her
governess
s
arm
pressed
herself
closer
with
a
little
gesture
of
appropriation
and
miss
viner
laid
her
hand
on
her
pupil
s
hair
darrow
felt
that
anna
s
eyes
had
turned
to
him
i
think
miss
viner
and
i
have
met
already
several
years
ago
in
i
remember
said
sophy
viner
in
the
same
clear
voice
how
charming
then
we
re
all
friends
but
luncheon
must
be
ready
said
leath
she
turned
back
to
the
door
and
the
little
procession
moved
down
the
two
long
with
effie
waltzing
on
ahead
xv
madame
de
chantelle
and
anna
had
planned
for
the
afternoon
a
visit
to
a
remotely
situated
acquaintance
whom
the
introduction
of
the
motor
had
transformed
into
a
neighbour
effie
was
to
pay
for
her
morning
s
holiday
by
an
hour
or
two
in
the
and
owen
suggested
that
he
and
darrow
should
betake
themselves
to
a
distant
covert
in
the
desultory
quest
for
pheasants
darrow
was
not
an
ardent
sportsman
but
any
pretext
for
physical
activity
would
have
been
acceptable
at
the
moment
and
he
was
glad
both
to
get
away
from
the
house
and
not
to
be
left
to
himself
when
he
came
downstairs
the
motor
was
at
the
door
and
anna
stood
before
the
hall
mirror
swathing
her
hat
in
veils
she
turned
at
the
sound
of
his
step
and
smiled
at
him
for
a
long
full
moment
i
d
no
idea
you
knew
miss
viner
she
said
as
he
helped
her
into
her
long
coat
it
came
back
to
me
luckily
that
i
d
seen
her
two
or
three
times
in
london
several
years
ago
she
was
secretary
or
something
of
the
sort
in
the
background
of
a
house
where
i
used
to
he
loathed
the
slighting
indifference
of
the
phrase
but
he
had
uttered
it
deliberately
had
been
secretly
practising
it
all
through
the
interminable
hour
at
the
now
that
it
was
spoken
he
shivered
at
its
note
of
condescension
in
such
cases
one
was
almost
sure
to
overdo
but
anna
seemed
to
notice
nothing
unusual
was
she
really
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
tell
me
exactly
how
she
struck
you
i
m
so
glad
it
turns
out
that
you
know
know
is
rather
exaggerated
we
used
to
pass
each
other
on
the
madame
de
chantelle
and
owen
appeared
together
as
he
spoke
and
anna
gathering
up
her
wraps
said
you
ll
tell
me
about
that
then
try
and
remember
everything
you
as
he
tramped
through
the
woods
at
his
young
host
s
side
darrow
felt
the
partial
relief
from
thought
produced
by
exercise
and
the
obligation
to
talk
little
as
he
cared
for
shooting
he
had
the
habit
of
concentration
which
makes
it
natural
for
a
man
to
throw
himself
wholly
into
whatever
business
he
has
in
hand
and
there
were
moments
of
the
afternoon
when
a
sudden
whirr
in
the
undergrowth
a
vivider
gleam
against
the
hazy
browns
and
greys
of
the
woods
was
enough
to
fill
the
foreground
of
his
attention
but
all
the
while
behind
these
voluntarily
emphasized
sensations
his
secret
consciousness
continued
to
revolve
on
a
loud
wheel
of
thought
for
a
time
it
seemed
to
be
sweeping
him
through
deep
gulfs
of
darkness
his
sensations
were
too
swift
and
swarming
to
be
disentangled
he
had
an
almost
physical
sense
of
struggling
for
air
of
battling
helplessly
with
material
obstructions
as
though
the
russet
covert
through
which
he
trudged
were
the
heart
of
a
maleficent
jungle
snatches
of
his
companion
s
talk
drifted
to
him
intermittently
through
the
confusion
of
his
thoughts
he
caught
eager
phrases
and
understood
that
owen
was
saying
things
about
himself
perhaps
hinting
indirectly
at
the
hopes
for
which
darrow
had
been
prepared
by
anna
s
confidences
he
had
already
become
aware
that
the
lad
liked
him
and
had
meant
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
showing
that
he
reciprocated
the
feeling
but
the
effort
of
fixing
his
attention
on
owen
s
words
was
so
great
that
it
left
no
power
for
more
than
the
briefest
and
most
inexpressive
replies
young
leath
it
appeared
felt
that
he
had
reached
a
in
his
career
a
height
from
which
he
could
impartially
survey
his
past
progress
and
projected
endeavour
at
one
time
he
had
had
musical
and
literary
yearnings
visions
of
desultory
artistic
indulgence
but
these
had
of
late
been
superseded
by
the
resolute
determination
to
plunge
into
practical
life
i
don
t
want
you
see
darrow
heard
him
explaining
to
drift
into
what
my
grandmother
poor
dear
is
trying
to
make
of
me
an
adjunct
of
givre
i
don
t
want
hang
it
all
to
slip
into
collecting
sensations
as
my
father
collected
i
want
effie
to
have
givre
it
s
my
grandmother
s
you
know
to
do
as
she
likes
with
and
i
ve
understood
lately
that
if
it
belonged
to
me
it
would
gradually
gobble
me
up
i
want
to
get
out
of
it
into
a
life
that
s
big
and
ugly
and
struggling
if
i
can
extract
beauty
out
of
that
so
much
the
better
that
ll
prove
my
vocation
but
i
want
to
make
beauty
not
be
drowned
in
the
like
a
bee
in
a
pot
of
darrow
knew
that
he
was
being
appealed
to
for
corroboration
of
these
views
and
for
encouragement
in
the
course
to
which
they
pointed
to
his
own
ears
his
answers
sounded
now
curt
now
irrelevant
at
one
moment
he
seemed
chillingly
indifferent
at
another
he
heard
himself
launching
out
on
a
flood
of
hazy
discursiveness
he
dared
not
look
at
owen
for
fear
of
detecting
the
lad
s
surprise
at
these
senseless
transitions
and
through
the
confusion
of
his
inward
struggles
and
outward
loquacity
he
heard
the
ceaseless
beat
of
the
question
what
in
god
s
name
shall
i
do
to
get
back
to
the
house
before
anna
s
return
seemed
his
most
pressing
necessity
he
did
not
clearly
know
why
he
simply
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
there
at
one
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
miss
viner
might
want
to
speak
to
him
alone
and
again
in
the
same
flash
that
it
would
probably
be
the
last
thing
she
would
want
at
any
rate
he
felt
he
ought
to
try
to
speak
to
her
or
at
least
be
prepared
to
do
so
if
the
chance
should
occur
finally
toward
four
he
told
his
companion
that
he
had
some
letters
on
his
mind
and
must
get
back
to
the
house
and
despatch
them
before
the
ladies
returned
he
left
owen
with
the
beater
and
walked
on
to
the
edge
of
the
covert
at
the
park
gates
he
struck
obliquely
through
the
trees
following
a
grass
avenue
at
the
end
of
which
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
roof
of
the
chapel
a
grey
haze
had
blotted
out
the
sun
and
the
still
air
clung
about
him
tepidly
at
length
the
raised
before
him
its
expanse
of
brick
and
he
was
struck
afresh
by
the
high
decorum
of
its
calm
lines
and
soberly
massed
surfaces
it
made
him
feel
in
the
turbid
coil
of
his
fears
and
passions
like
a
muddy
tramp
forcing
his
way
into
some
pure
sequestered
shrine
by
and
bye
he
knew
he
should
have
to
think
the
complex
horror
out
slowly
systematically
bit
by
bit
but
for
the
moment
it
was
whirling
him
about
so
fast
that
he
could
just
clutch
at
its
sharp
spikes
and
be
tossed
off
again
only
one
definite
immediate
fact
stuck
in
his
quivering
grasp
he
must
give
the
girl
every
chance
must
hold
himself
passive
till
she
had
taken
them
in
the
court
effie
ran
up
to
him
with
her
leaping
terrier
i
was
coming
out
to
meet
you
you
and
owen
miss
viner
was
coming
too
and
then
she
couldn
t
because
she
s
got
such
a
headache
i
m
afraid
i
gave
it
to
her
because
i
did
my
division
so
disgracefully
it
s
too
bad
isn
t
it
but
won
t
you
walk
back
with
me
nurse
won
t
mind
the
least
bit
she
d
so
much
rather
go
in
to
darrow
excused
himself
laughingly
on
the
plea
that
he
had
letters
to
write
which
was
much
worse
than
having
a
headache
and
not
infrequently
resulted
in
one
oh
then
you
can
go
and
write
them
in
owen
s
study
that
s
where
gentlemen
always
write
their
she
flew
on
with
her
dog
and
darrow
pursued
his
way
to
the
house
effie
s
suggestion
struck
him
as
useful
he
had
pictured
himself
as
vaguely
drifting
about
the
and
had
perceived
the
difficulty
of
miss
viner
s
having
to
seek
him
there
but
the
study
a
small
room
on
the
right
of
the
hall
was
in
easy
sight
from
the
staircase
and
so
situated
that
there
would
be
nothing
marked
in
his
being
found
there
in
talk
with
her
he
went
in
leaving
the
door
open
and
sat
down
at
the
the
room
was
a
friendly
heterogeneous
place
the
one
repository
in
the
and
house
of
all
its
unclassified
odds
and
ends
effie
s
and
fishing
rods
owen
s
guns
and
and
racquets
his
s
and
gardening
implements
even
madame
de
chantelle
s
embroidery
frame
and
the
back
numbers
of
the
catholic
weekly
the
early
twilight
had
begun
to
fall
and
presently
a
slanting
ray
across
the
desk
showed
darrow
that
a
servant
was
coming
across
the
hall
with
a
lamp
he
pulled
out
a
sheet
of
and
began
to
write
at
random
while
the
man
entering
put
the
lamp
at
his
elbow
and
vaguely
straightened
the
heap
of
newspapers
tossed
on
the
divan
then
his
steps
died
away
and
darrow
sat
leaning
his
head
on
his
locked
hands
presently
another
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
wavered
a
moment
and
then
moved
past
the
threshold
of
the
study
darrow
got
up
and
walked
into
the
hall
which
was
still
unlighted
in
the
dimness
he
saw
sophy
viner
standing
by
the
hall
door
in
her
hat
and
jacket
she
stopped
at
sight
of
him
her
hand
on
the
and
they
stood
for
a
second
without
speaking
have
you
seen
effie
she
suddenly
asked
she
went
out
to
meet
she
did
meet
me
just
now
in
the
court
she
s
gone
on
to
join
her
darrow
spoke
as
naturally
as
he
could
but
his
voice
sounded
to
his
own
ears
like
an
amateur
actor
s
in
a
light
part
miss
viner
without
answering
drew
back
the
bolt
he
watched
her
in
silence
as
the
door
swung
open
then
he
said
she
has
her
nurse
with
her
she
won
t
be
she
stood
irresolute
and
he
added
i
was
writing
in
there
won
t
you
come
and
have
a
little
talk
every
one
s
the
last
words
struck
him
as
not
but
there
was
no
time
to
choose
she
paused
a
second
longer
and
then
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
study
at
luncheon
she
had
sat
with
her
back
to
the
window
and
beyond
noting
that
she
had
grown
a
little
thinner
and
had
less
colour
and
vivacity
he
had
seen
no
change
in
her
but
now
as
the
lamplight
fell
on
her
face
its
whiteness
startled
him
poor
thing
poor
thing
what
in
heaven
s
name
can
she
suppose
he
wondered
do
sit
down
i
want
to
talk
to
you
he
said
and
pushed
a
chair
toward
her
she
did
not
seem
to
see
it
or
if
she
did
she
deliberately
chose
another
seat
he
came
back
to
his
own
chair
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
blotter
she
faced
him
from
the
farther
side
of
the
table
you
promised
to
let
me
hear
from
you
now
and
then
he
began
awkwardly
and
with
a
sharp
sense
of
his
awkwardness
a
faint
smile
made
her
face
more
tragic
did
i
there
was
nothing
to
tell
i
ve
had
no
history
like
the
happy
countries
he
waited
a
moment
before
asking
you
are
happy
here
i
was
she
said
with
a
faint
emphasis
why
do
you
say
was
you
re
surely
not
thinking
of
going
there
can
t
be
kinder
people
darrow
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
but
her
answer
came
to
him
with
deadly
definiteness
i
suppose
it
depends
on
you
whether
i
go
or
on
me
he
stared
at
her
across
owen
s
scattered
papers
good
god
what
can
you
think
of
me
to
say
that
the
mockery
of
the
question
flashed
back
at
him
from
her
wretched
face
she
stood
up
wandered
away
and
leaned
an
instant
in
the
darkening
from
there
she
turned
to
fling
back
at
him
don
t
imagine
i
m
the
least
bit
sorry
for
anything
he
steadied
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
it
was
harder
oh
damnably
harder
than
he
had
expected
arguments
expedients
palliations
evasions
all
seemed
to
be
slipping
away
from
him
he
was
left
face
to
face
with
the
mere
graceless
fact
of
his
inferiority
he
lifted
his
head
to
ask
at
random
you
ve
been
here
then
ever
since
since
june
yes
it
turned
out
that
the
farlows
were
hunting
for
me
all
the
while
for
she
stood
facing
him
her
back
to
the
window
evidently
impatient
to
be
gone
yet
with
something
still
to
say
or
that
she
expected
to
hear
him
say
the
sense
of
her
expectancy
benumbed
him
what
in
heaven
s
name
could
he
say
to
her
that
was
not
an
offense
or
a
mockery
your
idea
of
the
theatre
you
gave
that
up
at
once
then
oh
the
theatre
she
gave
a
little
laugh
i
couldn
t
wait
for
the
theatre
i
had
to
take
the
first
thing
that
offered
i
took
he
pushed
on
haltingly
i
m
glad
extremely
glad
you
re
happy
here
i
d
counted
on
your
letting
me
know
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
the
theatre
now
if
you
still
regret
it
if
you
re
not
contented
here
i
know
people
in
that
line
in
london
i
m
certain
i
can
manage
it
for
you
when
i
get
back
she
moved
up
to
the
table
and
leaned
over
it
to
ask
in
a
voice
that
was
hardly
above
a
whisper
then
you
do
want
me
to
leave
is
that
it
he
dropped
his
arms
with
a
groan
good
heavens
how
can
you
think
such
things
at
the
time
you
know
i
begged
you
to
let
me
do
what
i
could
but
you
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
and
ever
since
i
ve
been
wanting
to
be
of
use
to
do
something
anything
to
help
you
she
heard
him
through
motionless
without
a
quiver
of
the
clasped
hands
she
rested
on
the
edge
of
the
table
if
you
want
to
help
me
then
you
can
help
me
to
stay
here
she
brought
out
with
intensity
through
the
stillness
of
the
pause
which
followed
the
bray
of
a
sounded
far
down
the
drive
instantly
she
turned
with
a
last
white
look
at
him
and
fled
from
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
he
stood
motionless
benumbed
by
the
shock
of
her
last
words
she
was
afraid
then
afraid
of
him
sick
with
fear
of
him
the
discovery
beat
him
down
to
a
lower
depth
the
sounded
again
close
at
hand
and
he
turned
and
went
up
to
his
room
his
was
a
sufficient
pretext
for
not
immediately
joining
the
party
about
the
and
he
wanted
to
be
alone
and
try
to
put
a
little
order
into
his
tumultuous
thinking
upstairs
the
room
held
out
the
intimate
welcome
of
its
lamp
and
fire
everything
in
it
exhaled
the
same
sense
of
peace
and
stability
which
two
evenings
before
had
lulled
him
to
complacent
meditation
his
armchair
again
invited
him
from
the
hearth
but
he
was
too
agitated
to
sit
still
and
with
sunk
head
and
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
he
began
to
wander
up
and
down
the
room
his
five
minutes
with
sophy
viner
had
flashed
strange
lights
into
the
shadowy
corners
of
his
consciousness
the
girl
s
absolute
candour
her
hard
ardent
honesty
was
for
the
moment
the
vividest
point
in
his
thoughts
he
wondered
anew
as
he
had
wondered
before
at
the
way
in
which
the
harsh
discipline
of
life
had
stripped
her
of
false
sentiment
without
laying
the
least
touch
on
her
pride
when
they
had
parted
five
months
before
she
had
quietly
but
decidedly
rejected
all
his
offers
of
help
even
to
the
suggestion
of
his
trying
to
further
her
theatrical
aims
she
had
made
it
clear
that
she
wished
their
brief
alliance
to
leave
no
trace
on
their
lives
save
that
of
its
own
smiling
memory
but
now
that
they
were
unexpectedly
confronted
in
a
situation
which
seemed
to
her
terrified
fancy
to
put
her
at
his
mercy
her
first
impulse
was
to
defend
her
right
to
the
place
she
had
won
and
to
learn
as
quickly
as
possible
if
he
meant
to
dispute
it
while
he
had
pictured
her
as
shrinking
away
from
him
in
a
tremor
of
she
had
watched
his
movements
made
sure
of
her
opportunity
and
come
straight
down
to
have
it
out
with
him
he
was
so
struck
by
the
frankness
and
energy
of
the
proceeding
that
for
a
moment
he
lost
sight
of
the
view
of
his
own
character
implied
in
it
poor
thing
poor
thing
he
could
only
go
on
saying
and
with
the
repetition
of
the
words
the
picture
of
himself
as
she
must
see
him
pitiably
took
shape
again
he
understood
then
for
the
first
time
how
vague
in
comparison
with
hers
had
been
his
own
vision
of
the
part
he
had
played
in
the
brief
episode
of
their
relation
the
incident
had
left
in
him
a
sense
of
exasperation
and
but
that
as
he
now
perceived
was
chiefly
if
not
altogether
as
it
bore
on
his
preconceived
ideal
of
his
attitude
toward
another
woman
he
had
fallen
below
his
own
standard
of
sentimental
loyalty
and
if
he
thought
of
sophy
viner
it
was
mainly
as
the
chance
instrument
of
his
lapse
these
considerations
were
not
agreeable
to
his
pride
but
they
were
forced
on
him
by
the
example
of
her
valiant
if
he
had
cut
a
sorry
figure
in
the
business
he
owed
it
to
her
not
to
close
his
eyes
to
the
fact
any
longer
but
when
he
opened
them
what
did
he
see
the
situation
detestable
at
best
would
yet
have
been
relatively
simple
if
protecting
sophy
viner
had
been
the
only
duty
involved
in
it
the
fact
that
that
duty
was
paramount
did
not
do
away
with
the
contingent
obligations
it
was
darrow
s
instinct
in
difficult
moments
to
go
straight
to
the
bottom
of
the
difficulty
but
he
had
never
before
had
to
take
so
dark
a
dive
as
this
and
for
the
minute
he
shivered
on
the
brink
well
his
first
duty
at
any
rate
was
to
the
girl
he
must
let
her
see
that
he
meant
to
fulfill
it
to
the
last
jot
and
then
try
to
find
out
how
to
square
the
fulfillment
with
the
other
problems
already
in
his
path
xvi
in
the
oak
room
he
found
leath
her
and
effie
the
group
as
he
came
toward
it
down
the
long
composed
itself
prettily
about
the
the
lamps
and
the
fire
crossed
their
gleams
on
silver
and
porcelain
on
the
bright
haze
of
effie
s
hair
and
on
the
whiteness
of
anna
s
forehead
as
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
behind
the
she
did
not
move
at
darrow
s
approach
but
lifted
to
him
a
deep
gaze
of
peace
and
confidence
the
look
seemed
to
throw
about
him
the
spell
of
a
divine
security
he
felt
the
joy
of
a
convalescent
suddenly
waking
to
find
the
sunlight
on
his
face
madame
de
chantelle
across
her
knitting
discoursed
of
their
afternoon
s
excursion
with
occasional
pauses
induced
by
the
hypnotic
effect
of
the
fresh
air
and
effie
kneeling
on
the
hearth
softly
but
insistently
sought
to
implant
in
her
terrier
s
mind
some
notion
of
the
relation
between
a
vertical
attitude
and
sugar
darrow
took
a
chair
behind
the
little
girl
so
that
he
might
look
across
at
her
mother
it
was
almost
a
necessity
for
him
at
the
moment
to
let
his
eyes
rest
on
anna
s
face
and
to
meet
now
and
then
the
proud
shyness
of
her
gaze
madame
de
chantelle
presently
enquired
what
had
become
of
owen
and
a
moment
later
the
window
behind
her
opened
and
her
grandson
gun
in
hand
came
in
from
the
terrace
as
he
stood
there
in
the
with
dead
leaves
and
bits
of
bramble
clinging
to
his
clothes
the
scent
of
the
night
about
him
and
its
chill
on
his
pale
bright
face
he
really
had
the
look
of
a
young
faun
strayed
in
from
the
forest
effie
abandoned
the
terrier
to
fly
to
him
oh
owen
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
i
walked
miles
and
miles
with
nurse
and
couldn
t
find
you
and
we
met
jean
and
he
said
he
didn
t
know
where
you
d
nobody
knows
where
i
go
or
what
i
see
when
i
get
there
that
s
the
beauty
of
it
he
laughed
back
at
her
but
if
you
re
good
he
added
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
one
of
these
oh
now
owen
now
i
don
t
really
believe
i
ll
ever
be
much
better
than
i
am
let
owen
have
his
tea
first
her
mother
suggested
but
the
young
man
declining
the
offer
propped
his
gun
against
the
wall
and
lighting
a
cigarette
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
way
that
reminded
darrow
of
his
own
caged
wanderings
effie
pursued
him
with
her
blandishments
and
for
a
while
he
poured
out
to
her
a
stream
of
nonsense
then
he
sat
down
beside
his
and
leaned
over
to
help
himself
to
tea
where
s
miss
viner
he
asked
as
effie
climbed
up
on
him
why
isn
t
she
here
to
chain
up
this
ungovernable
infant
poor
miss
viner
has
a
headache
effie
says
she
went
to
her
room
as
soon
as
lessons
were
over
and
sent
word
that
she
wouldn
t
be
down
for
ah
said
owen
abruptly
setting
down
his
cup
he
stood
up
lit
another
cigarette
and
wandered
away
to
the
piano
in
the
room
beyond
from
the
twilight
where
he
sat
a
lonely
music
borne
on
fantastic
chords
floated
to
the
group
about
the
under
its
influence
madame
de
chantelle
s
meditative
pauses
increased
in
length
and
frequency
and
effie
stretched
herself
on
the
hearth
her
drowsy
head
against
the
dog
presently
her
nurse
appeared
and
anna
rose
at
the
same
time
stop
a
minute
in
my
on
your
way
up
she
paused
to
say
to
darrow
as
she
went
a
few
hours
earlier
her
request
would
have
brought
him
instantly
to
his
feet
she
had
given
him
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
an
inviting
glimpse
of
the
spacious
room
above
stairs
in
which
she
had
gathered
together
all
the
tokens
of
her
personal
tastes
the
retreat
in
which
as
one
might
fancy
anna
leath
had
hidden
the
restless
ghost
of
anna
summers
and
the
thought
of
a
talk
with
her
there
had
been
in
his
mind
ever
since
but
now
he
sat
motionless
as
if
by
the
play
of
madame
de
chantelle
s
needles
and
the
pulsations
of
owen
s
fitful
music
she
will
want
to
ask
me
about
the
girl
he
repeated
to
himself
with
a
fresh
sense
of
the
insidious
taint
that
embittered
all
his
thoughts
the
hand
of
the
clock
on
the
had
spanned
a
before
shame
at
his
own
indecision
finally
drew
him
to
his
feet
from
her
where
she
sat
over
a
pile
of
letters
anna
lifted
her
happy
smile
the
impulse
to
press
his
lips
to
it
made
him
come
close
and
draw
her
upward
she
threw
her
head
back
as
if
surprised
at
the
abruptness
of
the
gesture
then
her
face
leaned
to
his
with
the
slow
droop
of
a
flower
he
felt
again
the
sweep
of
the
secret
tides
and
all
his
fears
went
down
in
them
she
sat
down
in
the
by
the
fire
and
he
drew
an
armchair
close
to
her
his
gaze
roamed
peacefully
about
the
quiet
room
it
s
just
like
you
it
is
you
he
said
as
his
eyes
came
back
to
her
it
s
a
good
place
to
be
alone
in
i
don
t
think
i
ve
ever
before
cared
to
talk
with
any
one
let
s
be
quiet
then
it
s
the
best
way
of
yes
but
we
must
save
it
up
till
later
there
are
things
i
want
to
say
to
you
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
say
them
then
and
i
ll
oh
no
i
want
you
to
tell
me
about
miss
about
miss
viner
he
summoned
up
a
look
of
faint
interrogation
he
thought
she
seemed
surprised
at
his
surprise
it
s
important
naturally
she
explained
that
i
should
find
out
all
i
can
about
her
before
i
important
on
effie
s
account
on
effie
s
account
of
of
course
but
you
ve
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
haven
t
you
every
apparent
reason
we
all
like
her
effie
s
very
fond
of
her
and
she
seems
to
have
a
delightful
influence
on
the
child
but
we
know
so
little
after
all
about
her
antecedents
i
mean
and
her
past
history
that
s
why
i
want
you
to
try
and
recall
everything
you
heard
about
her
when
you
used
to
see
her
in
oh
on
that
score
i
m
afraid
i
sha
n
t
be
of
much
use
as
i
told
you
she
was
a
mere
shadow
in
the
background
of
the
house
i
saw
her
in
and
that
was
four
or
five
years
ago
when
she
was
with
a
murrett
yes
an
appalling
woman
who
runs
a
roaring
that
used
now
and
then
to
catch
me
in
its
wheels
i
escaped
from
them
long
ago
but
in
my
time
there
used
to
be
half
a
dozen
fagged
hands
to
tend
the
machine
and
miss
viner
was
one
of
them
i
m
glad
she
s
out
of
it
poor
girl
then
you
never
really
saw
anything
of
her
there
i
never
had
the
chance
murrett
discouraged
any
competition
on
the
part
of
her
especially
such
pretty
ones
i
suppose
darrow
made
no
comment
and
she
continued
and
murrett
s
own
opinion
if
she
d
offered
you
one
probably
wouldn
t
have
been
of
much
value
only
in
so
far
as
her
disapproval
would
on
general
principles
have
been
a
good
mark
for
miss
viner
but
surely
he
went
on
after
a
pause
you
could
have
found
out
about
her
from
the
people
through
whom
you
first
heard
of
her
anna
smiled
oh
we
heard
of
her
through
adelaide
painter
and
in
reply
to
his
glance
of
interrogation
she
explained
that
the
lady
in
question
was
a
spinster
of
south
braintree
massachusetts
who
having
come
to
paris
some
thirty
years
earlier
to
nurse
a
brother
through
an
illness
had
ever
since
protestingly
and
provisionally
camped
there
in
a
state
of
contemptuous
protestation
oddly
manifested
by
her
never
taking
the
off
her
chairs
her
long
residence
on
gallic
soil
had
not
mitigated
her
hostility
toward
the
creed
and
customs
of
the
race
but
though
she
always
referred
to
the
catholic
church
as
the
scarlet
woman
and
took
the
darkest
views
of
french
private
life
madame
de
chantelle
placed
great
reliance
on
her
judgment
and
experience
and
in
every
domestic
crisis
the
irreducible
adelaide
was
immediately
summoned
to
givre
it
s
all
the
odder
because
my
since
her
second
marriage
has
lived
so
much
in
the
country
that
she
s
practically
lost
sight
of
all
her
other
american
friends
besides
which
you
can
see
how
completely
she
has
identified
herself
with
monsieur
de
chantelle
s
nationality
and
adopted
french
habits
and
prejudices
yet
when
anything
goes
wrong
she
always
sends
for
adelaide
painter
who
s
more
american
than
the
stars
and
stripes
and
might
have
left
south
braintree
yesterday
if
she
hadn
t
rather
brought
it
over
with
her
in
her
darrow
laughed
well
then
if
south
braintree
vouches
for
miss
viner
oh
but
only
indirectly
when
we
had
that
odious
adventure
with
mademoiselle
grumeau
who
d
been
so
highly
recommended
by
monsieur
de
chantelle
s
aunt
the
chanoinesse
adelaide
was
of
course
sent
for
and
she
said
at
once
i
m
not
the
least
bit
surprised
i
ve
always
told
you
that
what
you
wanted
for
effie
was
a
sweet
american
girl
and
not
one
of
these
nasty
unluckily
she
couldn
t
at
the
moment
put
her
hand
on
a
sweet
american
but
she
presently
heard
of
miss
viner
through
the
farlows
an
excellent
couple
who
live
in
the
quartier
latin
and
write
about
french
life
for
the
american
papers
i
was
only
too
thankful
to
find
anyone
who
was
vouched
for
by
decent
people
and
so
far
i
ve
had
no
cause
to
regret
my
choice
but
i
know
after
all
very
little
about
miss
viner
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
reasons
why
i
want
as
soon
as
possible
to
find
out
more
to
find
out
all
i
since
you
ve
got
to
leave
effie
i
understand
your
feeling
in
that
way
but
is
there
in
such
a
case
any
recommendation
worth
half
as
much
as
your
own
direct
experience
no
and
it
s
been
so
favourable
that
i
was
ready
to
accept
it
as
conclusive
only
naturally
when
i
found
you
d
known
her
in
london
i
was
in
hopes
you
d
give
me
some
more
specific
reasons
for
liking
her
as
much
as
i
i
m
afraid
i
can
give
you
nothing
more
specific
than
my
general
vague
impression
that
she
seems
very
plucky
and
extremely
you
don
t
at
any
rate
know
anything
specific
to
the
contrary
to
the
contrary
how
should
i
i
m
not
conscious
of
ever
having
heard
any
one
say
two
words
about
her
i
only
infer
that
she
must
have
pluck
and
character
to
have
stuck
it
out
so
long
at
murrett
yes
poor
thing
she
has
pluck
certainly
and
pride
too
which
must
have
made
it
all
the
anna
rose
to
her
feet
you
don
t
know
how
glad
i
am
that
your
impression
s
on
the
whole
so
good
i
particularly
wanted
you
to
like
he
drew
her
to
him
with
a
smile
on
that
condition
i
m
prepared
to
love
even
adelaide
i
almost
hope
you
wont
have
the
chance
to
poor
adelaide
her
appearance
here
always
coincides
with
a
oh
then
i
must
manage
to
meet
her
he
held
anna
closer
saying
to
himself
as
he
smoothed
back
the
hair
from
her
forehead
what
does
anything
matter
but
just
this
must
i
go
now
he
added
aloud
she
answered
absently
it
must
be
time
to
dress
then
she
drew
back
a
little
and
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
my
love
oh
my
dear
love
she
said
it
came
to
him
that
they
were
the
first
words
of
endearment
he
had
heard
her
speak
and
their
rareness
gave
them
a
magic
quality
of
reassurance
as
though
no
danger
could
strike
through
such
a
shield
a
knock
on
the
door
made
them
draw
apart
anna
lifted
her
hand
to
her
hair
and
darrow
stooped
to
examine
a
photograph
of
effie
on
the
come
in
anna
said
the
door
opened
and
sophy
viner
entered
seeing
darrow
she
drew
back
do
come
in
miss
viner
anna
repeated
looking
at
her
kindly
the
girl
a
quick
red
in
her
cheeks
still
hesitated
on
the
threshold
i
m
so
sorry
but
effie
has
mislaid
her
latin
grammar
and
i
thought
she
might
have
left
it
here
i
need
it
to
prepare
for
tomorrow
s
is
this
it
darrow
asked
picking
up
a
book
from
the
table
oh
thank
you
he
held
it
out
to
her
and
she
took
it
and
moved
to
the
door
wait
a
minute
please
miss
viner
anna
said
and
as
the
girl
turned
back
she
went
on
with
her
quiet
smile
effie
told
us
you
d
gone
to
your
room
with
a
headache
you
mustn
t
sit
up
over
tomorrow
s
lessons
if
you
don
t
feel
sophy
s
blush
deepened
but
you
see
i
have
to
latin
s
one
of
my
weak
points
and
there
s
generally
only
one
page
of
this
book
between
me
and
she
threw
the
words
off
with
a
smile
do
excuse
my
disturbing
you
she
added
you
didn
t
disturb
me
anna
answered
darrow
perceived
that
she
was
looking
intently
at
the
girl
as
though
struck
by
something
tense
and
tremulous
in
her
face
her
voice
her
whole
mien
and
attitude
you
do
look
tired
you
d
much
better
go
straight
to
bed
effie
won
t
be
sorry
to
skip
her
thank
you
but
i
m
really
all
right
murmured
sophy
viner
her
glance
making
a
swift
circuit
of
the
room
dwelt
for
an
appreciable
instant
on
the
intimate
propinquity
of
and
then
she
turned
back

book
iii
xvii
at
dinner
that
evening
madame
de
chantelle
s
slender
monologue
was
thrown
out
over
gulfs
of
silence
owen
was
still
in
the
same
state
of
moody
abstraction
as
when
darrow
had
left
him
at
the
piano
and
even
anna
s
face
to
her
friend
s
vigilant
eye
revealed
not
perhaps
a
personal
preoccupation
but
a
vague
sense
of
impending
disturbance
she
smiled
she
bore
a
part
in
the
talk
her
eyes
dwelt
on
darrow
s
with
their
usual
deep
reliance
but
beneath
the
surface
of
her
serenity
his
tense
perceptions
detected
a
hidden
stir
he
was
sufficiently
to
tell
himself
that
it
was
doubtless
due
to
causes
with
which
he
was
not
directly
concerned
he
knew
the
question
of
owen
s
marriage
was
soon
to
be
raised
and
the
abrupt
alteration
in
the
young
man
s
mood
made
it
seem
probable
that
he
was
himself
the
centre
of
the
atmospheric
disturbance
for
a
moment
it
occurred
to
darrow
that
anna
might
have
employed
her
afternoon
in
preparing
madame
de
chantelle
for
her
grandson
s
impending
announcement
but
a
glance
at
the
elder
lady
s
unclouded
brow
showed
that
he
must
seek
elsewhere
the
clue
to
owen
s
taciturnity
and
his
s
concern
possibly
anna
had
found
reason
to
change
her
own
attitude
in
the
matter
and
had
made
the
change
known
to
owen
but
this
again
was
negatived
by
the
fact
that
during
the
afternoon
s
shooting
young
leath
had
been
in
a
mood
of
almost
extravagant
expansiveness
and
that
from
the
moment
of
his
late
return
to
the
house
till
just
before
dinner
there
had
been
to
darrow
s
certain
knowledge
no
possibility
of
a
private
talk
between
himself
and
his
this
obscured
if
it
narrowed
the
field
of
conjecture
and
darrow
s
gropings
threw
him
back
on
the
conclusion
that
he
was
probably
reading
too
much
significance
into
the
moods
of
a
lad
he
hardly
knew
and
who
had
been
described
to
him
as
subject
to
sudden
changes
of
humour
as
to
anna
s
fancied
perturbation
it
might
simply
be
due
to
the
fact
that
she
had
decided
to
plead
owen
s
cause
the
next
day
and
had
perhaps
already
had
a
glimpse
of
the
difficulties
awaiting
her
but
darrow
knew
that
he
was
too
deep
in
his
own
perplexities
to
judge
the
mental
state
of
those
about
him
it
might
be
after
all
that
the
variations
he
felt
in
the
currents
of
communication
were
caused
by
his
own
inward
tremor
such
at
any
rate
was
the
conclusion
he
had
reached
when
shortly
after
the
two
ladies
left
the
he
bade
owen
and
went
up
to
his
room
ever
since
the
rapid
which
had
followed
on
his
first
sight
of
sophy
viner
he
had
known
there
were
other
questions
to
be
faced
behind
the
one
immediately
confronting
him
on
the
score
of
that
one
at
least
his
mind
if
not
easy
was
relieved
he
had
done
what
was
possible
to
reassure
the
girl
and
she
had
apparently
recognized
the
sincerity
of
his
intention
he
had
patched
up
as
decent
a
conclusion
as
he
could
to
an
incident
that
should
obviously
have
had
no
sequel
but
he
had
known
all
along
that
with
the
securing
of
miss
viner
s
peace
of
mind
only
a
part
of
his
obligation
was
discharged
and
that
with
that
part
his
remaining
duty
was
in
conflict
it
had
been
his
first
business
to
convince
the
girl
that
their
secret
was
safe
with
him
but
it
was
far
from
easy
to
square
this
with
the
equally
urgent
obligation
of
anna
s
responsibility
toward
her
child
darrow
was
not
much
afraid
of
accidental
disclosures
both
he
and
sophy
viner
had
too
much
at
stake
not
to
be
on
their
guard
the
fear
that
beset
him
was
of
another
kind
and
had
a
profounder
source
he
wanted
to
do
all
he
could
for
the
girl
but
the
fact
of
having
had
to
urge
anna
to
confide
effie
to
her
was
peculiarly
repugnant
to
him
his
own
ideas
about
sophy
viner
were
too
mixed
and
indeterminate
for
him
not
to
feel
the
risk
of
such
an
experiment
yet
he
found
himself
in
the
intolerable
position
of
appearing
to
press
it
on
the
woman
he
desired
above
all
others
to
protect
till
late
in
the
night
his
thoughts
revolved
in
a
turmoil
of
indecision
his
pride
was
humbled
by
the
discrepancy
between
what
sophy
viner
had
been
to
him
and
what
he
had
thought
of
her
this
discrepancy
which
at
the
time
had
seemed
to
simplify
the
incident
now
turned
out
to
be
its
most
galling
complication
the
bare
truth
indeed
was
that
he
had
hardly
thought
of
her
at
all
either
at
the
time
or
since
and
that
he
was
ashamed
to
base
his
judgement
of
her
on
his
meagre
memory
of
their
adventure
the
essential
cheapness
of
the
whole
affair
as
far
as
his
share
in
it
was
concerned
came
home
to
him
with
humiliating
distinctness
he
would
have
liked
to
be
able
to
feel
that
at
the
time
at
least
he
had
staked
something
more
on
it
and
had
somehow
in
the
sequel
had
a
more
palpable
loss
to
show
but
the
plain
fact
was
that
he
hadn
t
spent
a
penny
on
it
which
was
no
doubt
the
reason
of
the
prodigious
score
it
had
since
been
rolling
up
at
any
rate
beat
about
the
case
as
he
would
it
was
clear
that
he
owed
it
to
anna
and
incidentally
to
his
own
peace
of
mind
to
find
some
way
of
securing
sophy
viner
s
future
without
leaving
her
installed
at
givre
when
he
and
his
wife
should
depart
for
their
new
post
the
night
brought
no
aid
to
the
solving
of
this
problem
but
it
gave
him
at
any
rate
the
clear
conviction
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
his
first
step
must
be
to
obtain
from
miss
viner
the
chance
of
another
and
calmer
talk
and
he
resolved
to
seek
it
at
the
earliest
hour
he
had
gathered
that
effie
s
lessons
were
preceded
by
an
early
scamper
in
the
park
and
conjecturing
that
her
governess
might
be
with
her
he
betook
himself
the
next
morning
to
the
terrace
whence
he
wandered
on
to
the
gardens
and
the
walks
beyond
the
atmosphere
was
still
and
pale
the
muffled
sunlight
gleamed
like
gold
tissue
through
grey
gauze
and
the
beech
alleys
tapered
away
to
a
blue
haze
blent
of
sky
and
forest
it
was
one
of
those
elusive
days
when
the
familiar
forms
of
things
seem
about
to
dissolve
in
a
prismatic
shimmer
the
stillness
was
presently
broken
by
joyful
barks
and
darrow
tracking
the
sound
overtook
effie
flying
down
one
of
the
long
alleys
at
the
head
of
her
pack
beyond
her
he
saw
miss
viner
seated
near
the
basin
beside
which
he
and
anna
had
paused
on
their
first
walk
to
the
river
the
girl
coming
forward
at
his
approach
returned
his
greeting
almost
gaily
his
first
glance
showed
him
that
she
had
regained
her
composure
and
the
change
in
her
appearance
gave
him
the
measure
of
her
fears
for
the
first
time
he
saw
in
her
again
the
sidelong
grace
that
had
charmed
his
eyes
in
paris
but
he
saw
it
now
as
in
a
painted
picture
shall
we
sit
down
a
minute
he
asked
as
effie
trotted
off
the
girl
looked
away
from
him
i
m
afraid
there
s
not
much
time
we
must
be
back
at
lessons
at
but
it
s
barely
ten
minutes
past
let
s
at
least
walk
a
little
way
toward
the
she
glanced
down
the
long
walk
ahead
of
them
and
then
back
in
the
direction
of
the
house
if
you
like
she
said
in
a
low
voice
with
one
of
her
quick
fluctuations
of
colour
but
instead
of
taking
the
way
he
proposed
she
turned
toward
a
narrow
path
which
branched
off
obliquely
through
the
trees
darrow
was
struck
and
vaguely
troubled
by
the
change
in
her
look
and
tone
there
was
in
them
an
undefinable
appeal
whether
for
help
or
forbearance
he
could
not
tell
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
there
might
have
been
something
misleading
in
his
so
pointedly
seeking
her
and
he
felt
a
momentary
constraint
to
ease
it
he
made
an
abrupt
dash
at
the
truth
i
came
out
to
look
for
you
because
our
talk
of
yesterday
was
so
unsatisfactory
i
want
to
hear
more
about
you
about
your
plans
and
prospects
i
ve
been
wondering
ever
since
why
you
ve
so
completely
given
up
the
her
face
instantly
sharpened
to
distrust
i
had
to
live
she
said
in
an
tone
i
understand
perfectly
that
you
should
like
it
here
for
a
his
glance
strayed
down
the
windings
ahead
of
them
it
s
delightful
you
couldn
t
be
better
placed
only
i
wonder
a
little
at
your
having
so
completely
given
up
any
idea
of
a
different
she
waited
for
a
moment
before
answering
i
suppose
i
m
less
restless
than
i
used
to
it
s
certainly
natural
that
you
should
be
less
restless
here
than
at
murrett
s
yet
somehow
i
don
t
seem
to
see
you
permanently
given
up
to
forming
the
what
exactly
do
you
seem
to
see
me
permanently
given
up
to
you
know
you
warned
me
rather
emphatically
against
the
she
threw
off
the
statement
without
impatience
as
though
they
were
discussing
together
the
fate
of
a
third
person
in
whom
both
were
benevolently
interested
darrow
considered
his
reply
if
i
did
it
was
because
you
so
emphatically
refused
to
let
me
help
you
to
a
she
stopped
short
and
faced
him
and
you
think
i
may
let
you
now
darrow
felt
the
blood
in
his
cheek
he
could
not
understand
her
attitude
if
indeed
she
had
consciously
taken
one
and
her
changes
of
tone
did
not
merely
reflect
the
involuntary
alternations
of
her
mood
it
humbled
him
to
perceive
once
more
how
little
he
had
to
guide
him
in
his
judgment
of
her
he
said
to
himself
if
i
d
ever
cared
a
straw
for
her
i
should
know
how
to
avoid
hurting
her
now
and
his
insensibility
struck
him
as
no
better
than
a
vulgar
obtuseness
but
he
had
a
fixed
purpose
ahead
and
could
only
push
on
to
it
i
hope
at
any
rate
you
ll
listen
to
my
reasons
there
s
been
time
on
both
sides
to
think
them
over
since
he
caught
himself
back
and
hung
helpless
on
the
since
whatever
words
he
chose
he
seemed
to
stumble
among
reminders
of
their
past
she
walked
on
beside
him
her
eyes
on
the
ground
then
i
m
to
understand
definitely
that
you
do
renew
your
offer
she
asked
with
all
my
heart
if
you
ll
only
let
me
she
raised
a
hand
as
though
to
check
him
it
s
extremely
friendly
of
you
i
do
believe
you
mean
it
as
a
friend
but
i
don
t
quite
understand
why
finding
me
as
you
say
so
well
placed
here
you
should
show
more
anxiety
about
my
future
than
at
a
time
when
i
was
actually
and
rather
desperately
oh
no
not
more
if
you
show
any
at
all
it
must
at
any
rate
be
for
different
in
fact
it
can
only
be
she
went
on
with
one
of
her
disconcerting
flashes
of
astuteness
for
one
of
two
reasons
either
because
you
feel
you
ought
to
help
me
or
because
for
some
reason
you
think
you
owe
it
to
leath
to
let
her
know
what
you
know
of
darrow
stood
still
in
the
path
behind
him
he
heard
effie
s
call
and
at
the
child
s
voice
he
saw
sophy
turn
her
head
with
the
alertness
of
one
who
is
obscurely
on
the
watch
the
look
was
so
fugitive
that
he
could
not
have
said
wherein
it
differed
from
her
normal
professional
air
of
having
her
pupil
on
her
mind
effie
sprang
past
them
and
darrow
took
up
the
girl
s
challenge
what
you
suggest
about
leath
is
hardly
worth
answering
as
to
my
reasons
for
wanting
to
help
you
a
good
deal
depends
on
the
words
one
uses
to
define
rather
indefinite
things
it
s
true
enough
that
i
want
to
help
you
but
the
wish
isn
t
due
to
to
any
past
kindness
on
your
part
but
simply
to
my
own
interest
in
you
why
not
put
it
that
our
friendship
gives
me
the
right
to
intervene
for
what
i
believe
to
be
your
benefit
she
took
a
few
hesitating
steps
and
then
paused
again
darrow
noticed
that
she
had
grown
pale
and
that
there
were
rings
of
shade
about
her
eyes
you
ve
known
leath
a
long
time
she
asked
him
suddenly
he
paused
with
a
sense
of
approaching
peril
a
long
time
she
told
me
you
were
friends
great
friends
yes
he
admitted
we
re
great
then
you
might
naturally
feel
yourself
justified
in
telling
her
that
you
don
t
think
i
m
the
right
person
for
he
uttered
a
sound
of
protest
but
she
disregarded
it
i
don
t
say
you
d
like
to
do
it
you
wouldn
t
you
d
hate
it
and
the
natural
alternative
would
be
to
try
to
persuade
me
that
i
d
be
better
off
somewhere
else
than
here
but
supposing
that
failed
and
you
saw
i
was
determined
to
stay
then
you
might
think
it
your
duty
to
tell
she
laid
the
case
before
him
with
a
cold
lucidity
i
should
in
your
place
i
believe
she
ended
with
a
little
laugh
i
shouldn
t
feel
justified
in
telling
her
behind
your
back
if
i
thought
you
unsuited
for
the
place
but
i
should
certainly
feel
justified
he
rejoined
after
a
pause
in
telling
you
if
i
thought
the
place
unsuited
to
and
that
s
what
you
re
trying
to
tell
me
now
yes
but
not
for
the
reasons
you
what
then
are
your
reasons
if
you
please
i
ve
already
implied
them
in
advising
you
not
to
give
up
all
idea
of
the
theatre
you
re
too
various
too
gifted
too
personal
to
tie
yourself
down
at
your
age
to
the
dismal
drudgery
of
and
is
that
what
you
ve
told
leath
she
rushed
the
question
out
at
him
as
if
she
expected
to
trip
him
up
over
it
he
was
moved
by
the
simplicity
of
the
stratagem
i
ve
told
her
exactly
nothing
he
replied
and
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
nothing
you
and
she
were
talking
about
me
when
i
came
into
her
darrow
felt
his
blood
rise
at
the
thrust
i
ve
told
her
simply
that
i
d
seen
you
once
or
twice
at
murrett
and
not
that
you
ve
ever
seen
me
since
and
not
that
i
ve
ever
seen
you
since
and
she
believes
you
she
completely
believes
you
he
uttered
a
protesting
exclamation
and
his
flush
reflected
itself
in
the
girl
s
cheek
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
didn
t
mean
to
ask
you
she
halted
and
again
cast
a
rapid
glance
behind
and
ahead
of
her
then
she
held
out
her
hand
well
then
thank
you
and
let
me
relieve
your
fears
i
sha
n
t
be
effie
s
governess
much
at
the
announcement
darrow
tried
to
merge
his
look
of
relief
into
the
expression
of
friendly
interest
with
which
he
grasped
her
hand
you
really
do
agree
with
me
then
and
you
ll
give
me
a
chance
to
talk
things
over
with
you
she
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
smile
i
m
not
thinking
of
the
stage
i
ve
had
another
offer
that
s
the
relief
was
hardly
less
great
after
all
his
personal
responsibility
ceased
with
her
departure
from
givre
you
ll
tell
me
about
that
then
won
t
you
her
smile
flickered
up
oh
you
ll
hear
about
it
soon
i
must
catch
effie
now
and
drag
her
back
to
the
she
walked
on
for
a
few
yards
and
then
paused
again
and
confronted
him
i
ve
been
odious
to
you
and
not
quite
honest
she
broke
out
suddenly
not
quite
honest
he
repeated
caught
in
a
fresh
wave
of
wonder
i
mean
in
seeming
not
to
trust
you
it
s
come
over
me
again
as
we
talked
that
at
heart
i
ve
always
known
i
could
her
colour
rose
in
a
bright
wave
and
her
eyes
clung
to
his
for
a
swift
instant
of
reminder
and
appeal
for
the
same
space
of
time
the
past
surged
up
in
him
confusedly
then
a
veil
dropped
between
them
here
s
effie
now
she
exclaimed
he
turned
and
saw
the
little
girl
trotting
back
to
them
her
hand
in
owen
leath
s
even
through
the
stir
of
his
subsiding
excitement
darrow
was
at
once
aware
of
the
change
effected
by
the
young
man
s
approach
for
a
moment
sophy
viner
s
cheeks
burned
redder
then
they
faded
to
the
paleness
of
white
petals
she
lost
however
nothing
of
the
bright
bravery
which
it
was
her
way
to
turn
on
the
unexpected
perhaps
no
one
less
familiar
with
her
face
than
darrow
would
have
discerned
the
tension
of
the
smile
she
transferred
from
himself
to
owen
leath
or
have
remarked
that
her
eyes
had
hardened
from
misty
grey
to
a
shining
darkness
but
her
observer
was
less
struck
by
this
than
by
the
corresponding
change
in
owen
leath
the
latter
when
he
came
in
sight
had
been
laughing
and
talking
unconcernedly
with
effie
but
as
his
eye
fell
on
miss
viner
his
expression
altered
as
suddenly
as
hers
the
change
for
darrow
was
less
definable
but
perhaps
for
that
reason
it
struck
him
as
more
sharply
significant
only
just
what
did
it
signify
owen
like
sophy
viner
had
the
kind
of
face
which
seems
less
the
stage
on
which
emotions
move
than
the
very
stuff
they
work
in
in
moments
of
excitement
his
odd
irregular
features
seemed
to
grow
fluid
to
unmake
and
remake
themselves
like
the
shadows
of
clouds
on
a
stream
darrow
through
the
rapid
flight
of
the
shadows
could
not
seize
on
any
specific
indication
of
feeling
he
merely
perceived
that
the
young
man
was
unaccountably
surprised
at
finding
him
with
miss
viner
and
that
the
extent
of
his
surprise
might
cover
all
manner
of
implications
darrow
s
first
idea
was
that
owen
if
he
suspected
that
the
conversation
was
not
the
result
of
an
accidental
encounter
might
wonder
at
his
s
suitor
being
engaged
at
such
an
hour
in
private
talk
with
her
little
girl
s
governess
the
thought
was
so
disturbing
that
as
the
three
turned
back
to
the
house
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
to
owen
i
came
out
to
look
for
your
but
in
the
contingency
he
feared
even
so
simple
a
phrase
might
seem
like
an
awkward
attempt
at
explanation
and
he
walked
on
in
silence
at
miss
viner
s
side
presently
he
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
owen
leath
and
the
girl
were
silent
also
and
this
gave
a
new
turn
to
his
thoughts
silence
may
be
as
variously
shaded
as
speech
and
that
which
enfolded
darrow
and
his
two
companions
seemed
to
his
watchful
perceptions
to
be
quivering
with
of
communication
at
first
he
was
aware
only
of
those
that
centred
in
his
own
troubled
consciousness
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
an
equal
activity
of
intercourse
was
going
on
outside
of
it
something
was
in
fact
passing
mutely
and
rapidly
between
young
leath
and
sophy
viner
but
what
it
was
and
whither
it
tended
darrow
when
they
reached
the
house
was
but
just
beginning
to
divine
xviii
anna
leath
from
the
terrace
watched
the
return
of
the
little
group
she
looked
down
on
them
as
they
advanced
across
the
garden
from
the
serene
height
of
her
unassailable
happiness
there
they
were
coming
toward
her
in
the
mild
morning
light
her
child
her
her
promised
husband
the
three
beings
who
filled
her
life
she
smiled
a
little
at
the
happy
picture
they
presented
effie
s
gambols
encircling
it
in
a
moving
frame
within
which
the
two
men
came
slowly
forward
in
the
silence
of
friendly
understanding
it
seemed
part
of
the
deep
intimacy
of
the
scene
that
they
should
not
be
talking
to
each
other
and
it
did
not
till
afterward
strike
her
as
odd
that
neither
of
them
apparently
felt
it
necessary
to
address
a
word
to
sophy
viner
anna
herself
at
the
moment
was
floating
in
the
of
felicity
on
a
tide
so
bright
and
buoyant
that
she
seemed
to
be
one
with
its
warm
waves
the
first
rush
of
bliss
had
stunned
and
dazzled
her
but
now
that
each
morning
she
woke
to
the
calm
certainty
of
its
recurrence
she
was
growing
used
to
the
sense
of
security
it
gave
i
feel
as
if
i
could
trust
my
happiness
to
carry
me
as
if
it
had
grown
out
of
me
like
so
she
phrased
it
to
darrow
as
later
in
the
morning
they
paced
the
together
his
answering
look
gave
her
the
same
assurance
of
safety
the
evening
before
he
had
seemed
preoccupied
and
the
shadow
of
his
mood
had
faintly
encroached
on
the
great
golden
orb
of
their
blessedness
but
now
it
was
uneclipsed
again
and
hung
above
them
high
and
bright
as
the
sun
at
noon
upstairs
in
her
that
afternoon
she
was
thinking
of
these
things
the
morning
mists
had
turned
to
rain
compelling
the
postponement
of
an
excursion
in
which
the
whole
party
were
to
have
joined
effie
with
her
governess
had
been
despatched
in
the
motor
to
do
some
shopping
at
francheuil
and
anna
had
promised
darrow
to
join
him
later
in
the
afternoon
for
a
quick
walk
in
the
rain
he
had
gone
to
his
room
after
luncheon
to
get
some
belated
letters
off
his
conscience
and
when
he
had
left
her
she
had
continued
to
sit
in
the
same
place
her
hands
crossed
on
her
knees
her
head
slightly
bent
in
an
attitude
of
brooding
retrospection
as
she
looked
back
at
her
past
life
it
seemed
to
her
to
have
consisted
of
one
ceaseless
effort
to
pack
into
each
hour
enough
to
fill
out
its
slack
folds
but
now
each
moment
was
like
a
miser
s
bag
stretched
to
bursting
with
pure
gold
she
was
roused
by
the
sound
of
owen
s
step
in
the
gallery
outside
her
room
it
paused
at
her
door
and
in
answer
to
his
knock
she
called
out
come
in
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
she
was
struck
by
his
look
of
pale
excitement
and
an
impulse
of
compunction
made
her
say
you
ve
come
to
ask
me
why
i
haven
t
spoken
to
your
grandmother
he
sent
about
him
a
glance
vaguely
reminding
her
of
the
strange
look
with
which
sophy
viner
had
swept
the
room
the
night
before
then
his
brilliant
eyes
came
back
to
her
i
ve
spoken
to
her
myself
he
said
anna
started
up
incredulous
you
ve
spoken
to
her
when
just
now
i
left
her
to
come
anna
s
first
feeling
was
one
of
annoyance
there
was
really
something
comically
incongruous
in
this
boyish
surrender
to
impulse
on
the
part
of
a
young
man
so
eager
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
life
she
looked
at
him
with
a
faintly
veiled
amusement
you
asked
me
to
help
you
and
i
promised
you
i
would
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
work
out
such
an
elaborate
plan
of
action
if
you
intended
to
take
the
matter
out
of
my
hands
without
telling
oh
don
t
take
that
tone
with
me
he
broke
out
almost
angrily
that
tone
what
tone
she
stared
at
his
quivering
face
i
might
she
pursued
still
more
properly
make
that
request
of
you
owen
reddened
and
his
vehemence
suddenly
subsided
i
meant
that
i
had
to
speak
that
s
all
you
don
t
give
me
a
chance
to
explain
she
looked
at
him
gently
wondering
a
little
at
her
own
impatience
owen
don
t
i
always
want
to
give
you
every
chance
it
s
because
i
do
that
i
wanted
to
talk
to
your
grandmother
first
that
i
was
waiting
and
watching
for
the
right
moment
the
right
moment
so
was
that
s
why
i
ve
his
voice
rose
again
and
took
the
sharp
edge
it
had
in
moments
of
high
pressure
his
turned
away
and
seated
herself
in
her
oh
my
dear
it
s
not
a
privilege
to
quarrel
over
you
ve
taken
a
load
off
my
shoulders
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
he
stood
before
her
irresolute
i
can
t
sit
down
he
said
walk
about
then
only
tell
me
i
m
his
immediate
response
was
to
throw
himself
into
the
armchair
at
her
side
where
he
lounged
for
a
moment
without
speaking
his
legs
stretched
out
his
arms
locked
behind
his
head
anna
her
eyes
on
his
face
waited
quietly
for
him
to
speak
well
of
course
it
was
just
what
one
she
takes
it
so
badly
you
mean
all
the
heavy
batteries
were
brought
up
my
father
givre
monsieur
de
chantelle
the
throne
and
the
altar
even
my
poor
mother
was
dragged
out
of
oblivion
and
armed
with
imaginary
anna
sighed
out
her
sympathy
well
you
were
prepared
for
all
that
i
thought
i
was
till
i
began
to
hear
her
say
it
then
it
sounded
so
incredibly
silly
that
i
told
her
oh
owen
owen
yes
i
know
i
was
a
fool
but
i
couldn
t
help
and
you
ve
mortally
offended
her
i
suppose
that
s
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
she
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
tiresome
boy
not
to
wait
and
let
me
speak
for
you
he
moved
slightly
away
so
that
her
hand
slipped
from
its
place
you
don
t
understand
he
said
frowning
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
till
you
explain
if
you
thought
the
time
had
come
to
tell
your
grandmother
why
not
have
asked
me
to
do
it
i
had
my
reasons
for
waiting
but
if
you
d
told
me
to
speak
i
should
have
done
so
he
evaded
her
appeal
by
a
sudden
turn
what
were
your
reasons
for
waiting
anna
did
not
immediately
answer
her
s
eyes
were
on
her
face
and
under
his
gaze
she
felt
a
faint
disquietude
i
was
feeling
my
way
i
wanted
to
be
absolutely
sure
absolutely
sure
of
what
she
delayed
again
for
a
just
perceptible
instant
why
simply
of
our
side
of
the
but
you
told
me
you
were
the
other
day
when
we
talked
it
over
before
they
came
back
from
oh
my
dear
if
you
think
that
in
such
a
complicated
matter
every
day
every
hour
doesn
t
more
or
less
modify
one
s
surest
sureness
that
s
just
what
i
m
driving
at
i
want
to
know
what
has
modified
she
made
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
what
does
it
matter
now
the
thing
s
done
i
don
t
know
that
i
could
give
any
clear
reason
he
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
down
on
her
with
a
tormented
brow
but
it
s
absolutely
necessary
that
you
at
his
tone
her
impatience
flared
up
it
s
not
necessary
that
i
should
give
you
any
explanation
whatever
since
you
ve
taken
the
matter
out
of
my
hands
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
was
trying
to
help
you
that
no
other
thought
ever
entered
my
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
if
you
doubted
it
you
were
right
to
do
what
you
ve
oh
i
never
doubted
you
he
retorted
with
a
fugitive
stress
on
the
pronoun
his
face
had
cleared
to
its
old
look
of
trust
don
t
be
offended
if
i
ve
seemed
to
he
went
on
i
can
t
quite
explain
myself
either
it
s
all
a
kind
of
tangle
isn
t
it
that
s
why
i
thought
i
d
better
speak
at
once
or
rather
why
i
didn
t
think
at
all
but
just
suddenly
blurted
the
thing
out
anna
gave
him
back
his
look
of
conciliation
well
the
how
and
why
don
t
much
matter
now
the
point
is
how
to
deal
with
your
grandmother
you
ve
not
told
me
what
she
means
to
oh
she
means
to
send
for
adelaide
the
name
drew
a
faint
note
of
mirth
from
him
and
relaxed
both
their
faces
to
a
smile
perhaps
anna
added
it
s
really
the
best
thing
for
us
owen
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
s
too
preposterous
and
humiliating
dragging
that
woman
into
our
secrets
this
could
hardly
be
a
secret
much
he
had
moved
to
the
hearth
where
he
stood
pushing
about
the
small
ornaments
on
the
but
at
her
answer
he
turned
back
to
her
you
haven
t
of
course
spoken
of
it
to
any
one
no
but
i
intend
to
she
paused
for
his
reply
and
as
it
did
not
come
she
continued
if
adelaide
painter
s
to
be
told
there
s
no
possible
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
tell
owen
abruptly
set
down
the
little
statuette
between
his
fingers
none
whatever
i
want
every
one
to
she
smiled
a
little
at
his
and
was
about
to
meet
it
with
a
word
of
banter
when
he
continued
facing
her
you
haven
t
as
yet
said
a
word
to
him
i
ve
told
him
nothing
except
what
the
discussion
of
our
own
plans
his
and
mine
obliged
me
to
that
you
were
thinking
of
marrying
and
that
i
wasn
t
willing
to
leave
france
till
i
d
done
what
i
could
to
see
you
at
her
first
words
the
colour
had
rushed
to
his
forehead
but
as
she
continued
she
saw
his
face
compose
itself
and
his
blood
subside
you
re
a
brick
my
dear
he
exclaimed
you
had
my
word
you
yes
yes
i
his
face
had
clouded
again
and
that
s
all
positively
all
you
ve
ever
said
to
him
positively
all
but
why
do
you
ask
he
had
a
moment
s
embarrassed
hesitation
it
was
understood
wasn
t
it
that
my
grandmother
was
to
be
the
first
to
know
well
and
so
she
has
been
hasn
t
she
since
you
ve
told
her
he
turned
back
to
his
restless
shifting
of
the
and
you
re
sure
that
nothing
you
ve
said
to
darrow
could
possibly
have
given
him
a
hint
nothing
i
ve
said
to
him
he
swung
about
on
her
why
do
you
put
it
in
that
way
in
what
way
why
as
if
you
thought
some
one
else
might
have
spoken
some
one
else
who
else
she
rose
to
her
feet
what
on
earth
my
dear
boy
can
you
be
driving
at
i
m
trying
to
find
out
whether
you
think
he
knows
anything
why
should
i
think
so
do
you
i
don
t
know
i
want
to
find
she
laughed
at
his
obstinate
insistence
to
test
my
veracity
i
suppose
at
the
sound
of
a
step
in
the
gallery
she
added
here
he
is
you
can
ask
him
she
met
darrow
s
knock
with
an
invitation
to
enter
and
he
came
into
the
room
and
paused
between
herself
and
owen
she
was
struck
as
he
stood
there
by
the
contrast
between
his
happy
careless
and
her
s
frowning
agitation
darrow
met
her
eyes
with
a
smile
am
i
too
soon
or
is
our
walk
given
up
no
i
was
just
going
to
get
she
continued
to
linger
between
the
two
looking
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
but
there
s
something
we
want
to
tell
you
first
owen
is
engaged
to
miss
the
sense
of
an
indefinable
interrogation
in
owen
s
mind
made
her
as
she
spoke
fix
her
eyes
steadily
on
darrow
he
had
paused
just
opposite
the
window
so
that
even
in
the
rainy
afternoon
light
his
face
was
clearly
open
to
her
scrutiny
for
a
second
immense
surprise
was
alone
visible
on
it
so
visible
that
she
half
turned
to
her
with
a
faint
smile
for
his
refuted
suspicions
why
she
wondered
should
owen
have
thought
that
darrow
had
already
guessed
his
secret
and
what
after
all
could
be
so
disturbing
to
him
in
this
not
improbable
contingency
at
any
rate
his
doubt
must
have
been
dispelled
there
was
nothing
feigned
about
darrow
s
astonishment
when
her
eyes
turned
back
to
him
he
was
already
crossing
to
owen
with
outstretched
hand
and
she
had
through
an
unaccountable
faint
flutter
of
misgiving
a
mere
confused
sense
of
their
exchanging
the
customary
phrases
her
next
perception
was
of
owen
s
tranquillized
look
and
of
his
smiling
return
of
darrow
s
congratulatory
grasp
she
had
the
eerie
feeling
of
having
been
overswept
by
a
shadow
which
there
had
been
no
cloud
to
cast
a
moment
later
owen
had
left
the
room
and
she
and
darrow
were
alone
he
had
turned
away
to
the
window
and
stood
staring
out
into
the
you
re
surprised
at
owen
s
news
she
asked
yes
i
am
surprised
he
answered
you
hadn
t
thought
of
its
being
miss
viner
why
should
i
have
thought
of
miss
viner
you
see
now
why
i
wanted
so
much
to
find
out
what
you
knew
about
he
made
no
comment
and
she
pursued
now
that
you
do
know
it
s
she
if
there
s
anything
he
moved
back
into
the
room
and
went
up
to
her
his
face
was
serious
with
a
slight
shade
of
annoyance
what
on
earth
should
there
be
as
i
told
you
i
ve
never
in
my
life
heard
any
one
say
two
words
about
miss
anna
made
no
answer
and
they
continued
to
face
each
other
without
moving
for
the
moment
she
had
ceased
to
think
about
sophy
viner
and
owen
the
only
thought
in
her
mind
was
that
darrow
was
alone
with
her
close
to
her
and
that
for
the
first
time
their
hands
and
lips
had
not
met
he
glanced
back
doubtfully
at
the
window
it
s
pouring
perhaps
you
d
rather
not
go
out
she
hesitated
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
urge
her
i
suppose
i
d
better
not
i
ought
to
go
at
once
to
my
owen
s
just
been
telling
her
she
said
darrow
hazarded
a
smile
that
accounts
for
my
having
on
my
way
up
heard
some
one
telephoning
for
miss
painter
at
the
allusion
they
laughed
together
vaguely
and
anna
moved
toward
the
door
he
held
it
open
for
her
and
followed
her
out
xix
he
left
her
at
the
door
of
madame
de
chantelle
s
and
plunged
out
alone
into
the
rain
the
wind
flung
about
the
stripped
of
the
avenue
and
dashed
the
stinging
streams
into
his
face
he
walked
to
the
gate
and
then
turned
into
the
and
strode
along
in
the
open
buffeted
by
slanting
gusts
the
evenly
ridged
fields
were
a
blurred
waste
of
mud
and
the
russet
coverts
which
he
and
owen
had
shot
through
the
day
before
shivered
desolately
against
a
driving
sky
darrow
walked
on
and
on
indifferent
to
the
direction
he
was
taking
his
thoughts
were
tossing
like
the
anna
s
announcement
had
not
come
to
him
as
a
complete
surprise
that
morning
as
he
strolled
back
to
the
house
with
owen
leath
and
miss
viner
he
had
had
a
momentary
intuition
of
the
truth
but
it
had
been
no
more
than
an
intuition
the
merest
faint
of
surmise
and
now
it
was
an
attested
fact
darkening
over
the
whole
sky
in
respect
of
his
own
attitude
he
saw
at
once
that
the
discovery
made
no
appreciable
change
if
he
had
been
bound
to
silence
before
he
was
no
less
bound
to
it
now
the
only
difference
lay
in
the
fact
that
what
he
had
just
learned
had
rendered
his
bondage
more
intolerable
hitherto
he
had
felt
for
sophy
viner
s
defenseless
state
a
sympathy
profoundly
tinged
with
compunction
but
now
he
was
of
an
obscure
indignation
against
her
superior
as
he
had
fancied
himself
to
judgments
he
was
aware
of
cherishing
the
common
doubt
as
to
the
disinterestedness
of
the
woman
who
tries
to
rise
above
her
past
no
wonder
she
had
been
sick
with
fear
on
meeting
him
it
was
in
his
power
to
do
her
more
harm
than
he
had
dreamed
assuredly
he
did
not
want
to
harm
her
but
he
did
desperately
want
to
prevent
her
marrying
owen
leath
he
tried
to
get
away
from
the
feeling
to
isolate
and
exteriorize
it
sufficiently
to
see
what
motives
it
was
made
of
but
it
remained
a
mere
blind
motion
of
his
blood
the
instinctive
recoil
from
the
thing
that
no
amount
of
arguing
can
make
his
tramp
prolonged
as
it
was
carried
him
no
nearer
to
enlightenment
and
after
trudging
through
two
or
three
sallow
villages
he
turned
about
and
wearily
made
his
way
back
to
givre
as
he
walked
up
the
black
avenue
making
for
the
lights
that
twinkled
through
its
pitching
branches
he
had
a
sudden
realisation
of
his
utter
helplessness
he
might
think
and
combine
as
he
would
but
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
that
he
could
do
he
dropped
his
wet
coat
in
the
vestibule
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
to
his
room
but
on
the
landing
he
was
overtaken
by
a
maid
who
in
tones
discreetly
lowered
begged
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
step
for
a
moment
into
the
marquise
s
somewhat
disconcerted
by
the
summons
he
followed
its
bearer
to
the
door
at
which
a
couple
of
hours
earlier
he
had
taken
leave
of
leath
it
opened
to
admit
him
to
a
large
room
which
he
immediately
perceived
to
be
empty
and
the
fact
gave
him
time
to
note
even
through
his
disturbance
of
mind
the
interesting
degree
to
which
madame
de
chantelle
s
apartment
dated
and
completed
her
its
looped
and
corded
curtains
its
purple
satin
upholstery
the
sevres
jardinieres
the
rosewood
the
little
velvet
tables
edged
with
lace
and
crowded
with
silver
and
simpering
miniatures
reconstituted
an
almost
perfect
setting
for
the
blonde
beauty
of
the
sixties
darrow
wondered
that
fraser
leath
s
filial
respect
should
have
prevailed
over
his
aesthetic
scruples
to
the
extent
of
permitting
such
an
anachronism
among
the
eighteenth
century
graces
of
givre
but
a
moment
s
reflection
made
it
clear
that
to
its
late
owner
the
attitude
would
have
seemed
exactly
in
the
traditions
of
the
place
madame
de
chantelle
s
emergence
from
an
inner
room
snatched
darrow
from
these
irrelevant
musings
she
was
already
beaded
and
bugled
for
the
evening
and
save
for
a
slight
pinkness
of
the
her
elaborate
appearance
revealed
no
mark
of
agitation
but
darrow
noticed
that
in
recognition
of
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
she
pinched
a
lace
handkerchief
between
her
thumb
and
forefinger
she
plunged
at
once
into
the
centre
of
the
difficulty
appealing
to
him
in
the
name
of
all
the
everards
to
descend
there
with
her
to
the
rescue
of
her
darling
she
wasn
t
she
was
sure
addressing
herself
in
vain
to
one
whose
person
whose
tone
whose
traditions
so
brilliantly
declared
his
indebtedness
to
the
principles
she
besought
him
to
defend
her
own
reception
of
darrow
the
confidence
she
had
at
once
accorded
him
must
have
shown
him
that
she
had
instinctively
felt
their
unanimity
of
sentiment
on
these
fundamental
questions
she
had
in
fact
recognized
in
him
the
one
person
whom
without
pain
to
her
maternal
piety
she
could
welcome
as
her
son
s
successor
and
it
was
almost
as
to
owen
s
father
that
she
now
appealed
to
darrow
to
aid
in
rescuing
the
wretched
boy
don
t
think
please
that
i
m
casting
the
least
reflection
on
anna
or
showing
any
want
of
sympathy
for
her
when
i
say
that
i
consider
her
partly
responsible
for
what
s
happened
anna
is
modern
i
believe
that
s
what
it
s
called
when
you
read
unsettling
books
and
admire
hideous
pictures
indeed
madame
de
chantelle
continued
leaning
confidentially
forward
i
myself
have
always
more
or
less
lived
in
that
atmosphere
my
son
you
know
was
very
revolutionary
only
he
didn
t
of
course
apply
his
ideas
they
were
purely
intellectual
that
s
what
dear
anna
has
always
failed
to
understand
and
i
m
afraid
she
s
created
the
same
kind
of
confusion
in
owen
s
mind
led
him
to
mix
up
things
you
read
about
with
things
you
do
you
know
of
course
that
she
sides
with
him
in
this
wretched
business
developing
at
length
upon
this
theme
she
finally
narrowed
down
to
the
point
of
darrow
s
intervention
my
grandson
darrow
calls
me
illogical
and
uncharitable
because
my
feelings
toward
miss
viner
have
changed
since
i
ve
heard
this
news
well
you
ve
known
her
it
appears
for
some
years
anna
tells
me
you
used
to
see
her
when
she
was
a
companion
or
secretary
or
something
to
a
dreadfully
vulgar
murrett
and
i
ask
you
as
a
friend
i
ask
you
as
one
of
us
to
tell
me
if
you
think
a
girl
who
has
had
to
knock
about
the
world
in
that
kind
of
position
and
at
the
orders
of
all
kinds
of
people
is
fitted
to
be
owen
s
wife
i
m
not
implying
anything
against
her
i
liked
the
girl
mr
darrow
but
what
s
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
don
t
want
her
to
marry
my
grandson
if
i
d
been
looking
for
a
wife
for
owen
i
shouldn
t
have
applied
to
the
farlows
to
find
me
one
that
s
what
anna
won
t
understand
and
what
you
must
help
me
to
make
her
darrow
to
this
appeal
could
oppose
only
the
repeated
assurance
of
his
inability
to
interfere
he
tried
to
make
madame
de
chantelle
see
that
the
very
position
he
hoped
to
take
in
the
household
made
his
intervention
the
more
hazardous
he
brought
up
the
usual
arguments
and
sounded
the
expected
note
of
sympathy
but
madame
de
chantelle
s
alarm
had
dispelled
her
habitual
imprecision
and
though
she
had
not
many
reasons
to
advance
her
argument
clung
to
its
point
like
a
frightened
animal
well
then
she
summed
up
in
response
to
his
repeated
assertions
that
he
saw
no
way
of
helping
her
you
can
at
least
even
if
you
won
t
say
a
word
to
the
others
tell
me
frankly
and
fairly
and
quite
between
ourselves
your
personal
opinion
of
miss
viner
since
you
ve
known
her
so
much
longer
than
we
he
protested
that
if
he
had
known
her
longer
he
had
known
her
much
less
well
and
that
he
had
already
on
this
point
convinced
anna
of
his
inability
to
pronounce
an
opinion
madame
de
chantelle
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
intelligence
your
opinion
of
murrett
is
enough
i
don
t
suppose
you
pretend
to
conceal
that
and
heaven
knows
what
other
unspeakable
people
she
s
been
mixed
up
with
the
only
friends
she
can
produce
are
called
hoke
don
t
try
to
reason
with
me
darrow
there
are
feelings
that
go
deeper
than
facts
and
i
know
she
thought
of
studying
for
the
stage
madame
de
chantelle
raised
the
corner
of
her
lace
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
i
m
like
my
furniture
she
murmured
and
i
thought
i
could
count
on
you
darrow
when
darrow
that
night
regained
his
room
he
reflected
with
a
flash
of
irony
that
each
time
he
entered
it
he
brought
a
fresh
troop
of
perplexities
to
trouble
its
serene
seclusion
since
the
day
after
his
arrival
only
hours
before
when
he
had
set
his
window
open
to
the
night
and
his
hopes
had
seemed
as
many
as
its
stars
each
evening
had
brought
its
new
problem
and
its
renewed
distress
but
nothing
as
yet
had
approached
the
blank
misery
of
mind
with
which
he
now
set
himself
to
face
the
fresh
questions
confronting
him
sophy
viner
had
not
shown
herself
at
dinner
so
that
he
had
had
no
glimpse
of
her
in
her
new
character
and
no
means
of
divining
the
real
nature
of
the
tie
between
herself
and
owen
leath
one
thing
however
was
clear
whatever
her
real
feelings
were
and
however
much
or
little
she
had
at
stake
if
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
owen
she
had
more
than
enough
skill
and
tenacity
to
defeat
any
arts
that
poor
madame
de
chantelle
could
oppose
to
her
darrow
himself
was
in
fact
the
only
person
who
might
possibly
turn
her
from
her
purpose
madame
de
chantelle
at
haphazard
had
hit
on
the
surest
means
of
saving
owen
if
to
prevent
his
marriage
were
to
save
him
darrow
on
this
point
did
not
pretend
to
any
fixed
opinion
one
feeling
alone
was
clear
and
insistent
in
him
he
did
not
mean
if
he
could
help
it
to
let
the
marriage
take
place
how
he
was
to
prevent
it
he
did
not
know
to
his
tormented
imagination
every
issue
seemed
closed
for
a
fantastic
instant
he
was
moved
to
follow
madame
de
chantelle
s
suggestion
and
urge
anna
to
withdraw
her
approval
if
his
reticence
his
efforts
to
avoid
the
subject
had
not
escaped
her
she
had
doubtless
set
them
down
to
the
fact
of
his
knowing
more
and
thinking
less
of
sophy
viner
than
he
had
been
willing
to
admit
and
he
might
take
advantage
of
this
to
turn
her
mind
gradually
from
the
project
yet
how
do
so
without
betraying
his
insincerity
if
he
had
had
nothing
to
hide
he
could
easily
have
said
it
s
one
thing
to
know
nothing
against
the
girl
it
s
another
to
pretend
that
i
think
her
a
good
match
for
but
could
he
say
even
so
much
without
betraying
more
it
was
not
anna
s
questions
or
his
answers
to
them
that
he
feared
but
what
might
cry
aloud
in
the
intervals
between
them
he
understood
now
that
ever
since
sophy
viner
s
arrival
at
givre
he
had
felt
in
anna
the
lurking
sense
of
something
unexpressed
and
perhaps
inexpressible
between
the
girl
and
himself
when
at
last
he
fell
asleep
he
had
fatalistically
committed
his
next
step
to
the
chances
of
the
morrow
the
first
that
offered
itself
was
an
encounter
with
leath
as
he
descended
the
stairs
the
next
morning
she
had
come
down
already
hatted
and
shod
for
a
dash
to
the
park
lodge
where
one
of
the
gatekeeper
s
children
had
had
an
accident
in
her
compact
dark
dress
she
looked
more
than
usually
straight
and
slim
and
her
face
wore
the
pale
glow
it
took
on
at
any
call
on
her
energy
a
kind
of
warrior
brightness
that
made
her
small
head
with
its
strong
chin
and
hair
like
that
of
an
amazon
in
a
frieze
it
was
their
first
moment
alone
since
she
had
left
him
the
afternoon
before
at
her
s
door
and
after
a
few
words
about
the
injured
child
their
talk
inevitably
reverted
to
owen
anna
spoke
with
a
smile
of
her
scene
with
madame
de
chantelle
who
belonged
poor
dear
to
a
generation
when
scenes
in
the
ladylike
and
lachrymal
sense
of
the
term
were
the
tribute
which
sensibility
was
expected
to
pay
to
the
unusual
their
conversation
had
been
in
every
detail
so
exactly
what
anna
had
foreseen
that
it
had
clearly
not
made
much
impression
on
her
but
she
was
eager
to
know
the
result
of
darrow
s
encounter
with
her
she
told
me
she
d
sent
for
you
she
always
sends
for
people
in
emergencies
that
again
i
suppose
is
de
l
epoque
and
failing
adelaide
painter
who
can
t
get
here
till
this
afternoon
there
was
no
one
but
poor
you
to
turn
she
put
it
all
lightly
with
a
lightness
that
seemed
to
his
nerves
slightly
undefinably
but
he
was
so
aware
of
his
own
tension
that
he
wondered
the
next
moment
whether
anything
would
ever
again
seem
to
him
quite
usual
and
insignificant
and
in
the
common
order
of
things
as
they
hastened
on
through
the
drizzle
in
which
the
storm
of
the
night
was
weeping
itself
out
anna
drew
close
under
his
umbrella
and
at
the
pressure
of
her
arm
against
his
he
recalled
his
walk
up
the
dover
pier
with
sophy
viner
the
memory
gave
him
a
startled
vision
of
the
inevitable
occasions
of
contact
confidence
familiarity
which
his
future
relationship
to
the
girl
would
entail
and
the
countless
chances
of
betrayal
that
every
one
of
them
involved
do
tell
me
just
what
you
said
he
heard
anna
pleading
and
with
sudden
resolution
he
affirmed
i
quite
understand
your
s
feeling
as
she
the
words
when
uttered
seemed
a
good
deal
less
significant
than
they
had
sounded
to
his
inner
ear
and
anna
replied
without
surprise
of
course
it
s
inevitable
that
she
should
but
we
shall
bring
her
round
in
under
the
dripping
dome
she
raised
her
face
to
his
don
t
you
remember
what
you
said
the
day
before
yesterday
together
we
can
t
fail
to
pull
it
off
for
him
i
ve
told
owen
that
so
you
re
pledged
and
there
s
no
going
the
day
before
yesterday
was
it
possible
that
no
longer
ago
life
had
seemed
a
sufficiently
simple
business
for
a
sane
man
to
hazard
such
assurances
anna
he
questioned
her
abruptly
why
are
you
so
anxious
for
this
marriage
she
stopped
short
to
face
him
why
but
surely
i
ve
explained
to
you
or
rather
i
ve
hardly
had
to
you
seemed
so
in
sympathy
with
my
reasons
i
didn
t
know
then
who
it
was
that
owen
wanted
to
the
words
were
out
with
a
spring
and
he
felt
a
clearer
air
in
his
brain
but
her
logic
hemmed
him
in
you
knew
yesterday
and
you
assured
me
then
that
you
hadn
t
a
word
to
say
against
miss
viner
the
name
once
uttered
sounded
on
and
on
in
his
ears
of
course
not
but
that
doesn
t
necessarily
imply
that
i
think
her
a
good
match
for
anna
made
no
immediate
answer
when
she
spoke
it
was
to
question
why
don
t
you
think
her
a
good
match
for
owen
well
madame
de
chantelle
s
reasons
seem
to
me
not
quite
as
negligible
as
you
you
mean
the
fact
that
she
s
been
murrett
s
secretary
and
that
the
people
who
employed
her
before
were
called
hoke
for
as
far
as
owen
and
i
can
make
out
these
are
the
gravest
charges
against
still
one
can
understand
that
the
match
is
not
what
madame
de
chantelle
had
dreamed
oh
perfectly
if
that
s
all
you
the
lodge
was
in
sight
and
she
hastened
her
step
he
strode
on
beside
her
in
silence
but
at
the
gate
she
checked
him
with
the
question
is
it
really
all
you
mean
of
course
he
heard
himself
declare
oh
then
i
think
i
shall
convince
you
even
if
i
can
t
like
madame
de
chantelle
summon
all
the
everards
to
my
aid
she
lifted
to
him
the
look
of
happy
laughter
that
sometimes
brushed
her
with
a
gleam
of
spring
darrow
watched
her
hasten
along
the
path
between
the
dripping
chrysanthemums
and
enter
the
lodge
after
she
had
gone
in
he
paced
up
and
down
outside
in
the
drizzle
waiting
to
learn
if
she
had
any
message
to
send
back
to
the
house
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
she
came
out
again
the
child
she
said
was
badly
though
not
dangerously
hurt
and
the
village
doctor
who
was
already
on
hand
had
asked
that
the
surgeon
already
summoned
from
francheuil
should
be
told
to
bring
with
him
certain
needful
appliances
owen
had
started
by
motor
to
fetch
the
surgeon
but
there
was
still
time
to
communicate
with
the
latter
by
telephone
the
doctor
furthermore
begged
for
an
immediate
provision
of
such
bandages
and
disinfectants
as
givre
itself
could
furnish
and
anna
bade
darrow
address
himself
to
miss
viner
who
would
know
where
to
find
the
necessary
things
and
would
direct
one
of
the
servants
to
bicycle
with
them
to
the
lodge
darrow
as
he
hurried
off
on
this
errand
had
at
once
perceived
the
opportunity
it
offered
of
a
word
with
sophy
viner
what
that
word
was
to
be
he
did
not
know
but
now
if
ever
was
the
moment
to
make
it
urgent
and
conclusive
it
was
unlikely
that
he
would
again
have
such
a
chance
of
unobserved
talk
with
her
he
had
supposed
he
should
find
her
with
her
pupil
in
the
but
he
learned
from
a
servant
that
effie
had
gone
to
francheuil
with
her
and
that
miss
viner
was
still
in
her
room
darrow
sent
her
word
that
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
the
lodge
and
a
moment
later
he
heard
her
coming
down
the
stairs
xx
for
a
second
as
she
approached
him
the
quick
tremor
of
her
glance
showed
her
all
intent
on
the
same
thought
as
himself
he
transmitted
his
instructions
with
mechanical
precision
and
she
answered
in
the
same
tone
repeating
his
words
with
the
intensity
of
attention
of
a
child
not
quite
sure
of
understanding
then
she
disappeared
up
the
stairs
darrow
lingered
on
in
the
hall
not
knowing
if
she
meant
to
return
yet
inwardly
sure
she
would
at
length
he
saw
her
coming
down
in
her
hat
and
jacket
the
rain
still
streaked
the
window
panes
and
in
order
to
say
something
he
said
you
re
not
going
to
the
lodge
yourself
i
ve
sent
one
of
the
men
ahead
with
the
things
but
i
thought
leath
might
need
she
didn
t
ask
for
you
he
returned
wondering
how
he
could
detain
her
but
she
answered
decidedly
i
d
better
he
held
open
the
door
picked
up
his
umbrella
and
followed
her
out
as
they
went
down
the
steps
she
glanced
back
at
him
you
ve
forgotten
your
i
sha
n
t
need
she
had
no
umbrella
and
he
opened
his
and
held
it
out
to
her
she
rejected
it
with
a
murmur
of
thanks
and
walked
on
through
the
thin
drizzle
and
he
kept
the
umbrella
over
his
own
head
without
offering
to
shelter
her
rapidly
and
in
silence
they
crossed
the
court
and
began
to
walk
down
the
avenue
they
had
traversed
a
third
of
its
length
before
darrow
said
abruptly
wouldn
t
it
have
been
fairer
when
we
talked
together
yesterday
to
tell
me
what
i
ve
just
heard
from
leath
fairer
she
stopped
short
with
a
startled
look
if
i
d
known
that
your
future
was
already
settled
i
should
have
spared
you
my
gratuitous
she
walked
on
more
slowly
for
a
yard
or
two
i
couldn
t
speak
yesterday
i
meant
to
have
told
you
oh
i
m
not
reproaching
you
for
your
lack
of
confidence
only
if
you
had
told
me
i
should
have
been
more
sure
of
your
really
meaning
what
you
said
to
me
she
did
not
ask
him
to
what
he
referred
and
he
saw
that
her
parting
words
to
him
lived
as
vividly
in
her
memory
as
in
his
is
it
so
important
that
you
should
be
sure
she
finally
questioned
not
to
you
naturally
he
returned
with
involuntary
asperity
it
was
incredible
yet
it
was
a
fact
that
for
the
moment
his
immediate
purpose
in
seeking
to
speak
to
her
was
lost
under
a
rush
of
resentment
at
counting
for
so
little
in
her
fate
of
what
stuff
then
was
his
feeling
for
her
made
a
few
hours
earlier
she
had
touched
his
thoughts
as
little
as
his
senses
but
now
he
felt
old
sleeping
instincts
stir
in
him
a
rush
of
rain
dashed
against
his
face
and
catching
sophy
s
hat
strained
it
back
from
her
loosened
hair
she
put
her
hands
to
her
head
with
a
familiar
gesture
he
came
closer
and
held
his
umbrella
over
her
at
the
lodge
he
waited
while
she
went
in
the
rain
continued
to
stream
down
on
him
and
he
shivered
in
the
dampness
and
stamped
his
feet
on
the
flags
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
long
time
elapsed
before
the
door
opened
and
she
reappeared
he
glanced
into
the
house
for
a
glimpse
of
anna
but
obtained
none
yet
the
mere
sense
of
her
nearness
had
completely
altered
his
mood
the
child
sophy
told
him
was
doing
well
but
leath
had
decided
to
wait
till
the
surgeon
came
darrow
as
they
turned
away
looked
through
the
gates
and
saw
the
doctor
s
carriage
by
the
roadside
let
me
tell
the
doctor
s
boy
to
drive
you
back
he
suggested
but
sophy
answered
no
i
ll
walk
and
he
moved
on
toward
the
house
at
her
side
she
expressed
no
surprise
at
his
not
remaining
at
the
lodge
and
again
they
walked
on
in
silence
through
the
rain
she
had
accepted
the
shelter
of
his
umbrella
but
she
kept
herself
at
such
a
carefully
measured
distance
that
even
the
slight
swaying
movements
produced
by
their
quick
pace
did
not
once
bring
her
arm
in
touch
with
his
and
noticing
this
he
perceived
that
every
drop
of
her
blood
must
be
alive
to
his
nearness
what
i
meant
just
now
he
began
was
that
you
ought
to
have
been
sure
of
my
good
she
seemed
to
weigh
the
words
sure
enough
for
what
to
trust
me
a
little
farther
than
you
i
ve
told
you
that
yesterday
i
wasn
t
free
to
well
since
you
are
now
may
i
say
a
word
to
you
she
paused
perceptibly
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
so
low
a
tone
that
he
had
to
bend
his
head
to
catch
her
answer
i
can
t
think
what
you
can
have
to
it
s
not
easy
to
say
here
at
any
rate
and
indoors
i
sha
n
t
know
where
to
say
he
glanced
about
him
in
the
rain
let
s
walk
over
to
the
for
a
to
the
right
of
the
drive
under
a
clump
of
trees
a
little
stucco
pavilion
crowned
by
a
balustrade
rose
on
arches
of
mouldering
brick
over
a
flight
of
steps
that
led
down
to
a
spring
other
steps
curved
up
to
a
door
above
darrow
mounted
these
and
opening
the
door
entered
a
small
circular
room
hung
with
loosened
strips
of
painted
paper
whereon
spectrally
faded
mandarins
executed
elongated
gestures
some
black
and
gold
chairs
with
straw
seats
and
an
unsteady
table
of
cracked
lacquer
stood
on
the
floor
of
tile
sophy
had
followed
him
without
comment
he
closed
the
door
after
her
and
she
stood
motionless
as
though
waiting
for
him
to
speak
now
we
can
talk
quietly
he
said
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
into
which
he
tried
to
put
an
intention
of
the
frankest
friendliness
she
merely
repeated
i
can
t
think
what
you
can
have
to
her
voice
had
lost
the
note
of
confidence
on
which
their
talk
of
the
previous
day
had
closed
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
pale
hostility
her
tone
made
it
evident
that
his
task
would
be
difficult
but
it
did
not
shake
his
resolve
to
go
on
he
sat
down
and
mechanically
she
followed
his
example
the
table
was
between
them
and
she
rested
her
arms
on
its
cracked
edge
and
her
chin
on
her
interlocked
hands
he
looked
at
her
and
she
gave
him
back
his
look
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
he
asked
at
length
a
faint
smile
lifted
in
the
remembered
way
the
left
corner
of
her
narrowed
lips
about
my
marriage
about
your
she
continued
to
consider
him
between
lids
what
can
i
say
that
leath
has
not
already
told
you
mrs
leath
has
told
me
nothing
whatever
but
the
fact
and
her
pleasure
in
well
aren
t
those
the
two
essential
points
the
essential
points
to
you
i
should
have
thought
oh
to
you
i
meant
she
put
in
keenly
he
flushed
at
the
retort
but
steadied
himself
and
rejoined
the
essential
point
to
me
is
of
course
that
you
should
be
doing
what
s
really
best
for
she
sat
silent
with
lowered
lashes
at
length
she
stretched
out
her
arm
and
took
up
from
the
table
a
little
threadbare
chinese
she
turned
its
ebony
stem
once
or
twice
between
her
fingers
and
as
she
did
so
darrow
was
whimsically
struck
by
the
way
in
which
their
evanescent
slight
romance
was
symbolized
by
the
fading
lines
on
the
frail
silk
do
you
think
my
engagement
to
leath
not
really
best
for
me
she
asked
at
length
darrow
before
answering
waited
long
enough
to
get
his
words
into
the
tersest
shape
not
without
a
sense
as
he
did
so
of
his
likeness
to
the
surgeon
deliberately
poising
his
lancet
for
a
clean
incision
i
m
not
sure
he
replied
of
its
being
the
best
thing
for
either
of
she
took
the
stroke
steadily
but
a
faint
red
swept
her
face
like
the
reflection
of
a
blush
she
continued
to
keep
her
lowered
eyes
on
the
screen
from
whose
point
of
view
do
you
speak
naturally
that
of
the
persons
most
from
owen
s
then
of
course
you
don
t
think
me
a
good
match
for
him
from
yours
first
of
all
i
don
t
think
him
a
good
match
for
he
brought
the
answer
out
abruptly
his
eyes
on
her
face
it
had
grown
extremely
pale
but
as
the
meaning
of
his
words
shaped
itself
in
her
mind
he
saw
a
curious
inner
light
dawn
through
her
set
look
she
lifted
her
lids
just
far
enough
for
a
veiled
glance
at
him
and
a
smile
slipped
through
them
to
her
trembling
lips
for
a
moment
the
change
merely
bewildered
him
then
it
pulled
him
up
with
a
sharp
jerk
of
apprehension
i
don
t
think
him
a
good
match
for
you
he
stammered
groping
for
the
lost
thread
of
his
words
she
threw
a
vague
look
about
the
chilly
room
and
you
ve
brought
me
here
to
tell
me
why
the
question
roused
him
to
the
sense
that
their
minutes
were
numbered
and
that
if
he
did
not
immediately
get
to
his
point
there
might
be
no
other
chance
of
making
it
my
chief
reason
is
that
i
believe
he
s
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
give
you
the
kind
of
support
you
at
his
words
her
face
changed
again
freezing
to
a
tragic
coldness
she
stared
straight
ahead
of
her
perceptibly
struggling
with
the
tremor
of
her
muscles
and
when
she
had
controlled
it
she
flung
out
a
pleasantry
but
you
see
i
ve
always
had
to
support
myself
he
s
a
boy
darrow
pushed
on
a
charming
wonderful
boy
but
with
no
more
notion
than
a
boy
how
to
deal
with
the
inevitable
daily
problems
the
trivial
stupid
unimportant
things
that
life
is
chiefly
made
up
i
ll
deal
with
them
for
him
she
rejoined
they
ll
be
more
than
ordinarily
she
shot
a
challenging
glance
at
him
you
must
have
some
special
reason
for
saying
only
my
clear
perception
of
the
what
facts
do
you
mean
darrow
hesitated
you
must
know
better
than
i
he
returned
at
length
that
the
way
won
t
be
made
easy
to
mrs
leath
at
any
rate
has
made
it
madame
de
chantelle
will
how
do
you
know
that
she
flung
back
he
paused
again
not
sure
how
far
it
was
prudent
to
reveal
himself
in
the
confidence
of
the
household
then
to
avoid
involving
anna
he
answered
madame
de
chantelle
sent
for
me
sent
for
you
to
talk
to
you
about
me
the
colour
rose
to
her
forehead
and
her
eyes
burned
black
under
lowered
brows
by
what
right
i
should
like
to
know
what
have
you
to
do
with
me
or
with
anything
in
the
world
that
concerns
me
darrow
instantly
perceived
what
dread
suspicion
again
possessed
her
and
the
sense
that
it
was
not
wholly
unjustified
caused
him
a
passing
pang
of
shame
but
it
did
not
turn
him
from
his
purpose
i
m
an
old
friend
of
leath
s
it
s
not
unnatural
that
madame
de
chantelle
should
talk
to
she
dropped
the
screen
on
the
table
and
stood
up
turning
on
him
the
same
small
mask
of
wrath
and
scorn
which
had
glared
at
him
in
paris
when
he
had
confessed
to
his
suppression
of
her
letter
she
walked
away
a
step
or
two
and
then
came
back
may
i
ask
what
madame
de
chantelle
said
to
you
she
made
it
clear
that
she
should
not
encourage
the
and
what
was
her
object
in
making
that
clear
to
you
darrow
hesitated
i
suppose
she
thought
that
she
could
persuade
you
to
turn
leath
against
me
he
was
silent
and
she
pressed
him
was
that
it
that
was
but
if
you
don
t
if
you
keep
your
promise
my
promise
to
say
nothing
nothing
whatever
her
strained
look
threw
a
haggard
light
along
the
pause
as
she
spoke
the
whole
odiousness
of
the
scene
rushed
over
him
of
course
i
shall
say
nothing
you
know
that
he
leaned
to
her
and
laid
his
hand
on
hers
you
know
i
wouldn
t
for
the
world
she
drew
back
and
hid
her
face
with
a
sob
then
she
sank
again
into
her
seat
stretched
her
arms
across
the
table
and
laid
her
face
upon
them
he
sat
still
overwhelmed
with
compunction
after
a
long
interval
in
which
he
had
painfully
measured
the
seconds
by
her
breathing
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
face
washed
clear
of
bitterness
don
t
suppose
i
don
t
know
what
you
must
have
thought
of
me
the
cry
struck
him
down
to
a
lower
depth
of
my
poor
child
he
felt
like
answering
the
shame
of
it
is
that
i
ve
never
thought
of
you
at
all
but
he
could
only
uselessly
repeat
i
ll
do
anything
i
can
to
help
she
sat
silent
drumming
the
table
with
her
hand
he
saw
that
her
doubt
of
him
was
allayed
and
the
perception
made
him
more
ashamed
as
if
her
trust
had
first
revealed
to
him
how
near
he
had
come
to
not
deserving
it
suddenly
she
began
to
speak
you
think
then
i
ve
no
right
to
marry
him
no
right
god
forbid
i
only
meant
that
you
d
rather
i
didn
t
marry
any
friend
of
she
brought
it
out
deliberately
not
as
a
question
but
as
a
mere
dispassionate
statement
of
fact
darrow
in
turn
stood
up
and
wandered
away
helplessly
to
the
window
he
stood
staring
out
through
its
small
discoloured
panes
at
the
dim
brown
distances
then
he
moved
back
to
the
table
i
ll
tell
you
exactly
what
i
meant
you
ll
be
wretched
if
you
marry
a
man
you
re
not
in
love
he
knew
the
risk
of
misapprehension
that
he
ran
but
he
estimated
his
chances
of
success
as
precisely
in
proportion
to
his
peril
if
certain
signs
meant
what
he
thought
they
did
he
might
yet
at
what
cost
he
would
not
stop
to
think
make
his
past
pay
for
his
future
the
girl
at
his
words
had
lifted
her
head
with
a
movement
of
surprise
her
eyes
slowly
reached
his
face
and
rested
there
in
a
gaze
of
deep
interrogation
he
held
the
look
for
a
moment
then
his
own
eyes
dropped
and
he
waited
at
length
she
began
to
speak
you
re
mistaken
you
re
quite
he
waited
a
moment
longer
mistaken
in
thinking
what
you
think
i
m
as
happy
as
if
i
deserved
it
she
suddenly
proclaimed
with
a
laugh
she
stood
up
and
moved
toward
the
door
now
are
you
satisfied
she
asked
turning
her
vividest
face
to
him
from
the
threshold
xxi
down
the
avenue
there
came
to
them
with
the
opening
of
the
door
the
voice
of
owen
s
motor
it
was
the
signal
which
had
interrupted
their
first
talk
and
again
instinctively
they
drew
apart
at
the
sound
without
a
word
darrow
turned
back
into
the
room
while
sophy
viner
went
down
the
steps
and
walked
back
alone
toward
the
court
at
luncheon
the
presence
of
the
surgeon
and
the
of
madame
de
chantelle
who
had
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
a
headache
combined
to
shift
the
conversational
centre
of
gravity
and
darrow
under
shelter
of
the
necessarily
impersonal
talk
had
time
to
adjust
his
disguise
and
to
perceive
that
the
others
were
engaged
in
the
same
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
seen
young
leath
and
sophy
viner
together
since
he
had
learned
of
their
engagement
but
neither
revealed
more
emotion
than
befitted
the
occasion
it
was
evident
that
owen
was
deeply
under
the
girl
s
charm
and
that
at
the
least
sign
from
her
his
bliss
would
have
broken
bounds
but
her
reticence
was
justified
by
the
tacitly
recognized
fact
of
madame
de
chantelle
s
disapproval
this
also
visibly
weighed
on
anna
s
mind
making
her
manner
to
sophy
if
no
less
kind
yet
a
trifle
more
constrained
than
if
the
moment
of
final
understanding
had
been
reached
so
darrow
interpreted
the
tension
perceptible
under
the
fluent
exchange
of
commonplaces
in
which
he
was
diligently
sharing
but
he
was
more
and
more
aware
of
his
inability
to
test
the
moral
atmosphere
about
him
he
was
like
a
man
in
fever
testing
another
s
temperature
by
the
touch
after
luncheon
anna
who
was
to
motor
the
surgeon
home
suggested
to
darrow
that
he
should
accompany
them
effie
was
also
of
the
party
and
darrow
inferred
that
anna
wished
to
give
her
a
chance
to
be
alone
with
his
betrothed
on
the
way
back
after
the
surgeon
had
been
left
at
his
door
the
little
girl
sat
between
her
mother
and
darrow
and
her
presence
kept
their
talk
from
taking
a
personal
turn
darrow
knew
that
leath
had
not
yet
told
effie
of
the
relation
in
which
he
was
to
stand
to
her
the
premature
divulging
of
owen
s
plans
had
thrown
their
own
into
the
background
and
by
common
consent
they
continued
in
the
little
girl
s
presence
on
terms
of
an
informal
friendliness
the
sky
had
cleared
after
luncheon
and
to
prolong
their
excursion
they
returned
by
way
of
the
ruin
which
was
to
have
been
the
scene
of
the
projected
picnic
this
circuit
brought
them
back
to
the
park
gates
not
long
before
sunset
and
as
anna
wished
to
stop
at
the
lodge
for
news
of
the
injured
child
darrow
left
her
there
with
effie
and
walked
on
alone
to
the
house
he
had
the
impression
that
she
was
slightly
surprised
at
his
not
waiting
for
her
but
his
inner
restlessness
vented
itself
in
an
intense
desire
for
bodily
movement
he
would
have
liked
to
walk
himself
into
a
state
of
torpor
to
tramp
on
for
hours
through
the
moist
winds
and
the
healing
darkness
and
come
back
staggering
with
fatigue
and
sleep
but
he
had
no
pretext
for
such
a
flight
and
he
feared
that
at
such
a
moment
his
prolonged
absence
might
seem
singular
to
anna
as
he
approached
the
house
the
thought
of
her
nearness
produced
a
swift
reaction
of
mood
it
was
as
if
an
intenser
vision
of
her
had
scattered
his
perplexities
like
morning
mists
at
this
moment
wherever
she
was
he
knew
he
was
safely
shut
away
in
her
thoughts
and
the
knowledge
made
every
other
fact
dwindle
away
to
a
shadow
he
and
she
loved
each
other
and
their
love
arched
over
them
open
and
ample
as
the
day
in
all
its
sunlit
spaces
there
was
no
cranny
for
a
fear
to
lurk
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
be
in
her
presence
and
would
read
his
reassurance
in
her
eyes
and
presently
before
dinner
she
would
contrive
that
they
should
have
an
hour
by
themselves
in
her
and
he
would
sit
by
the
hearth
and
watch
her
quiet
movements
and
the
way
the
bluish
lustre
on
her
hair
purpled
a
little
as
she
bent
above
the
fire
a
carriage
drove
out
of
the
court
as
he
entered
it
and
in
the
hall
his
vision
was
dispelled
by
the
exceedingly
substantial
presence
of
a
lady
in
a
waterproof
and
a
tweed
hat
who
stood
firmly
planted
in
the
centre
of
a
pile
of
luggage
as
to
which
she
was
giving
involved
but
lucid
directions
to
the
footman
who
had
just
admitted
her
she
went
on
with
these
directions
regardless
of
darrow
s
entrance
merely
fixing
her
small
pale
eyes
on
him
while
she
proceeded
in
a
deep
contralto
voice
and
a
fluent
french
pronounced
with
the
purest
boston
accent
to
specify
the
destination
of
her
bags
and
this
enabled
darrow
to
give
her
back
a
gaze
protracted
enough
to
take
in
all
the
details
of
her
plain
person
from
the
square
sallow
face
beneath
bands
of
grey
hair
to
the
blunt
protruding
under
her
wide
walking
skirt
she
submitted
to
this
scrutiny
with
no
more
evidence
of
surprise
than
a
monument
examined
by
a
tourist
but
when
the
fate
of
her
luggage
had
been
settled
she
turned
suddenly
to
darrow
and
dropping
her
eyes
from
his
face
to
his
feet
asked
in
trenchant
accents
what
sort
of
boots
have
you
got
on
before
he
could
summon
his
wits
to
the
consideration
of
this
question
she
continued
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
indignation
until
americans
get
used
to
the
fact
that
france
is
under
water
for
half
the
year
they
re
perpetually
risking
their
lives
by
not
being
properly
protected
i
suppose
you
ve
been
tramping
through
all
this
nasty
clammy
mud
as
if
you
d
been
taking
a
stroll
on
boston
darrow
with
a
laugh
affirmed
his
previous
experience
of
french
dampness
and
the
degree
to
which
he
was
on
his
guard
against
it
but
the
lady
with
a
contemptuous
snort
rejoined
you
young
men
are
all
alike
to
which
she
appended
after
another
hard
look
at
him
i
suppose
you
re
george
darrow
i
used
to
know
one
of
your
mother
s
cousins
who
married
a
tunstall
of
mount
vernon
street
my
name
is
adelaide
painter
have
you
been
in
boston
lately
no
i
m
sorry
for
that
i
hear
there
have
been
several
new
houses
built
at
the
lower
end
of
commonwealth
avenue
and
i
hoped
you
could
tell
me
about
them
i
haven
t
been
there
for
thirty
years
miss
painter
s
arrival
at
givre
produced
the
same
effect
as
the
wind
s
hauling
around
to
the
north
after
days
of
languid
weather
when
darrow
joined
the
group
about
the
she
had
already
given
a
tingle
to
the
air
madame
de
chantelle
still
remained
invisible
above
stairs
but
darrow
had
the
impression
that
even
through
her
drawn
curtains
and
bolted
doors
a
stimulating
whiff
must
have
entered
anna
was
in
her
usual
seat
behind
the
and
sophy
viner
presently
led
in
her
pupil
owen
was
also
there
seated
as
usual
a
little
apart
from
the
others
and
following
miss
painter
s
massive
movements
and
equally
substantial
utterances
with
a
smile
of
secret
intelligence
which
gave
darrow
the
idea
of
his
having
been
in
clandestine
parley
with
the
enemy
darrow
further
took
note
that
the
girl
and
her
suitor
perceptibly
avoided
each
other
but
this
might
be
a
natural
result
of
the
tension
miss
painter
had
been
summoned
to
relieve
sophy
viner
would
evidently
permit
no
recognition
of
the
situation
save
that
which
it
lay
with
madame
de
chantelle
to
accord
but
meanwhile
miss
painter
had
proclaimed
her
tacit
sense
of
it
by
summoning
the
girl
to
a
seat
at
her
side
darrow
as
he
continued
to
observe
the
newcomer
who
was
perched
on
her
like
a
granite
image
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
was
aware
that
in
a
more
detached
frame
of
mind
he
would
have
found
an
extreme
interest
in
studying
and
classifying
miss
painter
it
was
not
that
she
said
anything
remarkable
or
betrayed
any
of
those
unspoken
perceptions
which
give
significance
to
the
most
commonplace
utterances
she
talked
of
the
lateness
of
her
train
of
an
impending
crisis
in
international
politics
of
the
difficulty
of
buying
english
tea
in
paris
and
of
the
enormities
of
which
french
servants
were
capable
and
her
views
on
these
subjects
were
enunciated
with
a
uniformity
of
emphasis
implying
complete
unconsciousness
of
any
difference
in
their
interest
and
importance
she
always
applied
to
the
french
race
the
distant
epithet
of
those
people
but
she
betrayed
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
many
of
its
members
and
an
encyclopaedic
knowledge
of
the
domestic
habits
financial
difficulties
and
private
complications
of
various
persons
of
social
importance
yet
as
she
evidently
felt
no
incongruity
in
her
attitude
so
she
revealed
no
desire
to
parade
her
familiarity
with
the
fashionable
or
indeed
any
sense
of
it
as
a
fact
to
be
paraded
it
was
evident
that
the
titled
ladies
whom
she
spoke
of
as
mimi
or
simone
or
odette
were
as
much
those
people
to
her
as
the
bonne
who
tampered
with
her
tea
and
steamed
the
stamps
off
her
letters
when
by
a
miracle
i
don
t
put
them
in
the
box
her
whole
attitude
was
of
a
vast
grim
tolerance
of
as
though
she
had
been
some
wonderful
automatic
machine
which
recorded
facts
but
had
not
yet
been
perfected
to
the
point
of
sorting
or
labelling
them
all
this
as
darrow
was
aware
still
fell
short
of
accounting
for
the
influence
she
obviously
exerted
on
the
persons
in
contact
with
her
it
brought
a
slight
relief
to
his
state
of
tension
to
go
on
wondering
while
he
watched
and
listened
just
where
the
mystery
lurked
perhaps
after
all
it
was
in
the
fact
of
her
blank
insensibility
an
insensibility
so
devoid
of
egotism
that
it
had
no
hardness
and
no
grimaces
but
rather
the
freshness
of
a
simpler
mental
state
after
living
as
he
had
as
they
all
had
for
the
last
few
days
in
an
atmosphere
perpetually
tremulous
with
echoes
and
implications
it
was
restful
and
fortifying
merely
to
walk
into
the
big
blank
area
of
miss
painter
s
mind
so
vacuous
for
all
its
accumulated
items
so
echoless
for
all
its
vacuity
his
hope
of
a
word
with
anna
before
dinner
was
dispelled
by
her
rising
to
take
miss
painter
up
to
madame
de
chantelle
and
he
wandered
away
to
his
own
room
leaving
owen
and
miss
viner
engaged
in
working
out
a
for
effie
madame
de
chantelle
possibly
as
the
result
of
her
friend
s
ministrations
was
able
to
appear
at
the
rather
pale
and
and
casting
tenderly
reproachful
glances
at
her
grandson
who
faced
them
with
impervious
serenity
and
the
situation
was
relieved
by
the
fact
that
miss
viner
as
usual
had
remained
in
the
with
her
pupil
darrow
conjectured
that
the
real
clash
of
arms
would
not
take
place
till
the
morrow
and
wishing
to
leave
the
field
open
to
the
contestants
he
set
out
early
on
a
solitary
walk
it
was
nearly
when
he
returned
from
it
and
came
upon
anna
just
emerging
from
the
house
she
had
on
her
hat
and
jacket
and
was
apparently
coming
forth
to
seek
him
for
she
said
at
once
madame
de
chantelle
wants
you
to
go
up
to
to
go
up
to
her
now
that
s
the
message
she
sent
she
appears
to
rely
on
you
to
do
she
added
with
a
smile
whatever
it
is
let
s
have
it
over
darrow
through
his
rising
sense
of
apprehension
wondered
why
instead
of
merely
going
for
a
walk
he
had
not
jumped
into
the
first
train
and
got
out
of
the
way
till
owen
s
affairs
were
finally
settled
but
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
can
i
do
he
protested
following
anna
back
into
the
hall
i
don
t
know
but
owen
seems
so
to
rely
on
you
too
owen
is
he
to
be
there
no
but
you
know
i
told
him
he
could
count
on
but
i
ve
said
to
your
all
i
well
then
you
can
only
repeat
this
did
not
seem
to
darrow
to
simplify
his
case
as
much
as
she
appeared
to
think
and
once
more
he
had
a
movement
of
recoil
there
s
no
possible
reason
for
my
being
mixed
up
in
this
affair
anna
gave
him
a
reproachful
glance
not
the
fact
that
i
am
she
reminded
him
but
even
this
only
stiffened
his
resistance
why
should
you
be
either
to
this
extent
the
question
made
her
pause
she
glanced
about
the
hall
as
if
to
be
sure
they
had
it
to
themselves
and
then
in
a
lowered
voice
i
don
t
know
she
suddenly
confessed
but
somehow
if
they
re
not
happy
i
feel
as
if
we
shouldn
t
oh
well
darrow
acquiesced
in
the
tone
of
the
man
who
perforce
yields
to
so
lovely
an
unreasonableness
escape
was
after
all
impossible
and
he
could
only
resign
himself
to
being
led
to
madame
de
chantelle
s
door
within
among
the
and
furbelows
he
found
miss
painter
seated
in
a
redundant
purple
armchair
with
the
incongruous
air
of
a
horseman
bestriding
a
heavy
mount
madame
de
chantelle
sat
opposite
still
a
little
wan
and
disordered
under
her
elaborate
hair
and
clasping
the
handkerchief
whose
visibility
symbolized
her
distress
on
the
young
man
s
entrance
she
sighed
out
a
plaintive
welcome
to
which
she
immediately
appended
mr
darrow
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
at
heart
you
re
with
me
the
directness
of
the
challenge
made
it
easier
for
darrow
to
protest
and
he
reiterated
his
inability
to
give
an
opinion
on
either
side
but
anna
declares
you
have
on
hers
he
could
not
restrain
a
smile
at
this
faint
flaw
in
an
impartiality
so
scrupulous
every
evidence
of
feminine
inconsequence
in
anna
seemed
to
attest
her
deeper
subjection
to
the
most
inconsequent
of
passions
he
had
certainly
promised
her
his
help
but
before
he
knew
what
he
was
promising
he
met
madame
de
chantelle
s
appeal
by
replying
if
there
were
anything
i
could
possibly
say
i
should
want
it
to
be
in
miss
viner
s
you
d
want
it
to
be
yes
but
could
you
make
it
so
as
far
as
facts
go
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
make
it
either
for
or
against
her
i
ve
already
said
that
i
know
nothing
of
her
except
that
she
s
as
if
that
weren
t
enough
weren
t
all
there
ought
to
be
miss
painter
put
in
impatiently
she
seemed
to
address
herself
to
darrow
though
her
small
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
friend
madame
de
chantelle
seems
to
imagine
she
pursued
that
a
young
american
girl
ought
to
have
a
dossier
a
or
whatever
you
call
it
what
those
awful
women
in
the
streets
have
here
in
our
country
it
s
enough
to
know
that
a
young
girl
s
pure
and
lovely
people
don
t
immediately
ask
her
to
show
her
and
her
madame
de
chantelle
looked
plaintively
at
her
sturdy
monitress
you
don
t
expect
me
not
to
ask
if
she
s
got
a
family
no
nor
to
think
the
worse
of
her
if
she
hasn
t
the
fact
that
she
s
an
orphan
ought
with
your
ideas
to
be
a
merit
you
won
t
have
to
invite
her
father
and
mother
to
givre
adelaide
adelaide
the
mistress
of
givre
lamented
lucretia
mary
the
other
returned
and
darrow
spared
an
instant
s
amusement
to
the
quaint
incongruity
of
the
name
you
know
you
sent
for
darrow
to
refute
me
and
how
can
he
till
he
knows
what
i
think
you
think
it
s
perfectly
simple
to
let
owen
marry
a
girl
we
know
nothing
about
no
but
i
don
t
think
it
s
perfectly
simple
to
prevent
the
shrewdness
of
the
answer
increased
darrow
s
interest
in
miss
painter
she
had
not
hitherto
struck
him
as
being
a
person
of
much
penetration
but
he
now
felt
sure
that
her
gimlet
gaze
might
bore
to
the
heart
of
any
practical
problem
madame
de
chantelle
sighed
out
her
recognition
of
the
difficulty
i
haven
t
a
word
to
say
against
miss
viner
but
she
s
knocked
about
so
as
it
s
called
that
she
must
have
been
mixed
up
with
some
rather
dreadful
people
if
only
owen
could
be
made
to
see
that
if
one
could
get
at
a
few
facts
i
mean
she
says
for
instance
that
she
has
a
sister
but
it
seems
she
doesn
t
even
know
her
address
if
she
does
she
may
not
want
to
give
it
to
you
i
daresay
the
sister
s
one
of
the
dreadful
people
i
ve
no
doubt
that
with
a
little
time
you
could
rake
up
dozens
of
them
have
her
traced
as
they
call
it
in
detective
stories
i
don
t
think
you
d
frighten
owen
but
you
might
it
s
natural
enough
he
should
have
been
corrupted
by
those
foreign
ideas
you
might
even
manage
to
part
him
from
the
girl
but
you
couldn
t
keep
him
from
being
in
love
with
her
i
saw
that
when
i
looked
them
over
last
evening
i
said
to
myself
it
s
a
real
american
case
as
sweet
and
sound
as
well
if
you
take
his
loaf
away
from
him
what
are
you
going
to
feed
him
with
instead
which
of
your
nasty
paris
poisons
do
you
think
he
ll
turn
to
supposing
you
succeed
in
keeping
him
out
of
a
really
bad
mess
and
knowing
the
young
man
as
i
do
i
rather
think
that
at
this
crisis
the
only
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
marry
him
slap
off
to
somebody
else
well
then
who
may
i
ask
would
you
pick
out
one
of
your
sweet
french
ingenues
i
suppose
with
as
much
mind
as
a
minnow
and
as
much
snap
as
a
egg
you
might
hustle
him
into
that
kind
of
marriage
i
daresay
you
could
but
if
i
know
owen
the
natural
thing
would
happen
before
the
first
baby
was
i
don
t
know
why
you
insinuate
such
odious
things
against
owen
do
you
think
it
would
be
odious
of
him
to
return
to
his
real
love
when
he
d
been
forcibly
parted
from
her
at
any
rate
it
s
what
your
french
friends
do
every
one
of
them
only
they
don
t
generally
have
the
grace
to
go
back
to
an
old
love
and
i
believe
upon
my
word
owen
would
madame
de
chantelle
looked
at
her
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
exultation
of
course
you
realize
adelaide
that
in
suggesting
this
you
re
insinuating
the
most
shocking
things
against
miss
viner
when
i
say
that
if
you
part
two
young
things
who
are
dying
to
be
happy
in
the
lawful
way
it
s
ten
to
one
they
ll
come
together
in
an
unlawful
one
i
m
insinuating
shocking
things
against
you
lucretia
mary
in
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
you
ll
care
to
assume
such
a
responsibility
before
your
maker
and
you
wouldn
t
if
you
talked
things
straight
out
with
him
instead
of
merely
sending
him
messages
through
a
miserable
sinner
like
yourself
darrow
expected
this
assault
on
her
adopted
creed
to
provoke
in
madame
de
chantelle
an
explosion
of
pious
indignation
but
to
his
surprise
she
merely
murmured
i
don
t
know
what
darrow
ll
think
of
you
mr
darrow
probably
knows
his
bible
as
well
as
i
do
miss
painter
calmly
rejoined
adding
a
moment
later
without
the
least
perceptible
change
of
voice
or
expression
i
suppose
you
ve
heard
that
gisele
de
folembray
s
husband
accuses
her
of
being
mixed
up
with
the
duc
d
arcachon
in
that
business
of
trying
to
sell
a
lot
of
imitation
pearls
to
homer
pond
the
chicago
woman
the
duke
s
engaged
to
it
seems
the
jeweller
says
gisele
brought
pond
there
and
got
per
cent
which
of
course
she
passed
on
to
d
arcachon
the
poor
old
duchess
is
in
a
fearful
state
so
afraid
her
son
ll
lose
pond
when
i
think
that
gisele
is
old
bradford
wagstaff
s
i
m
thankful
he
s
safe
in
mount
auburn
xxii
it
was
not
until
late
that
afternoon
that
darrow
could
claim
his
postponed
hour
with
anna
when
at
last
he
found
her
alone
in
her
it
was
with
a
sense
of
liberation
so
great
that
he
sought
no
logical
justification
of
it
he
simply
felt
that
all
their
destinies
were
in
miss
painter
s
grasp
and
that
resistance
being
useless
he
could
only
enjoy
the
sweets
of
surrender
anna
herself
seemed
as
happy
and
for
more
explicable
reasons
she
had
assisted
after
luncheon
at
another
debate
between
madame
de
chantelle
and
her
confidant
and
had
surmised
when
she
withdrew
from
it
that
victory
was
permanently
perched
on
miss
painter
s
banners
i
don
t
know
how
she
does
it
unless
it
s
by
the
dead
weight
of
her
convictions
she
detests
the
french
so
that
she
d
back
up
owen
even
if
she
knew
nothing
or
knew
too
much
of
miss
viner
she
somehow
regards
the
match
as
a
protest
against
the
corruption
of
european
morals
i
told
owen
that
was
his
great
chance
and
he
s
made
the
most
of
what
a
tactician
you
are
you
make
me
feel
that
i
hardly
know
the
rudiments
of
diplomacy
darrow
smiled
at
her
abandoning
himself
to
a
perilous
sense
of
she
gave
him
back
his
smile
i
m
afraid
i
think
nothing
short
of
my
own
happiness
is
worth
wasting
any
diplomacy
on
that
s
why
i
mean
to
resign
from
the
service
of
my
country
he
rejoined
with
a
laugh
of
deep
content
the
feeling
that
both
resistance
and
apprehension
were
vain
was
working
like
wine
in
his
veins
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
deflect
the
course
of
events
now
he
could
only
stand
aside
and
take
his
chance
of
safety
underneath
this
fatalistic
feeling
was
the
deep
sense
of
relief
that
he
had
after
all
said
and
done
nothing
that
could
in
the
least
degree
affect
the
welfare
of
sophy
viner
that
fact
took
a
millstone
off
his
neck
meanwhile
he
gave
himself
up
once
more
to
the
joy
of
anna
s
presence
they
had
not
been
alone
together
for
two
long
days
and
he
had
the
lover
s
sense
that
he
had
forgotten
or
at
least
underestimated
the
strength
of
the
spell
she
cast
once
more
her
eyes
and
her
smile
seemed
to
bound
his
world
he
felt
that
their
light
would
always
move
with
him
as
the
sunset
moves
before
a
ship
at
sea
the
next
day
his
sense
of
security
was
increased
by
a
decisive
incident
it
became
known
to
the
expectant
household
that
madame
de
chantelle
had
yielded
to
the
tremendous
impact
of
miss
painter
s
determination
and
that
sophy
viner
had
been
sent
for
to
the
purple
satin
at
luncheon
owen
s
radiant
countenance
proclaimed
the
happy
sequel
and
darrow
when
the
party
had
moved
back
to
the
for
coffee
deemed
it
discreet
to
wander
out
alone
to
the
terrace
with
his
cigar
the
conclusion
of
owen
s
romance
brought
his
own
plans
once
more
to
the
front
anna
had
promised
that
she
would
consider
dates
and
settle
details
as
soon
as
madame
de
chantelle
and
her
grandson
had
been
reconciled
and
darrow
was
eager
to
go
into
the
question
at
once
since
it
was
necessary
that
the
preparations
for
his
marriage
should
go
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
anna
he
knew
would
not
seek
any
farther
pretext
for
delay
and
he
strolled
up
and
down
contentedly
in
the
sunshine
certain
that
she
would
come
out
and
reassure
him
as
soon
as
the
reunited
family
had
claimed
its
due
share
of
her
attention
but
when
she
finally
joined
him
her
first
word
was
for
the
younger
lovers
i
want
to
thank
you
for
what
you
ve
done
for
owen
she
began
with
her
happiest
smile
who
i
he
laughed
are
you
confusing
me
with
miss
painter
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
for
me
she
corrected
herself
you
ve
been
even
more
of
a
help
to
us
than
my
dear
child
what
on
earth
have
i
done
you
ve
managed
to
hide
from
madame
de
chantelle
that
you
don
t
really
like
poor
darrow
felt
the
pallour
in
his
cheek
not
like
her
what
put
such
an
idea
into
your
head
oh
it
s
more
than
an
idea
it
s
a
feeling
but
what
difference
does
it
make
after
all
you
saw
her
in
such
a
different
setting
that
it
s
natural
you
should
be
a
little
doubtful
but
when
you
know
her
better
i
m
sure
you
ll
feel
about
her
as
i
it
s
going
to
be
hard
for
me
not
to
feel
about
everything
as
you
well
then
please
begin
with
my
he
gave
her
back
in
the
same
tone
of
banter
agreed
if
you
ll
agree
to
feel
as
i
do
about
the
pressing
necessity
of
our
getting
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that
too
you
don
t
know
what
a
weight
is
off
my
mind
with
sophy
here
for
good
i
shall
feel
so
differently
about
leaving
effie
i
ve
seen
much
more
accomplished
governesses
to
my
cost
but
i
ve
never
seen
a
young
thing
more
gay
and
kind
and
human
you
must
have
noticed
though
you
ve
seen
them
so
little
together
how
effie
expands
when
she

that

what
i
want
madame
de
chantelle

provide
the
necessary
she
clasped
her
hands
on
his
arm
yes
i
m
ready
to
go
with
you
now
but
first
of
all
this
very
moment
you
must
come
with
me
to
effie

knows
of
course
nothing
of
what
s
been
happening
and
i
want
her
to
be
told
first
about
effie
sought
throughout
the
house
was
presently
traced
to
the
and
thither
darrow
mounted
with
anna
he
had
never
seen
her
so
alight
with
happiness
and
he
had
caught
her
buoyancy
of
mood
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
it
s
over
it
s
over
as
if
some
monstrous
midnight
hallucination
had
been
routed
by
the
return
of
day
as
they
approached
the
door
the
terrier
s
barks
came
to
them
through
laughing
remonstrances
she
s
giving
him
his
dinner
anna
whispered
her
hand
in
darrow
s
don
t
forget
the
they
heard
another
voice
call
out
darrow
halted
on
the
threshold
oh
not
now
not
now
i
mean
she
d
rather
have
you
tell
her
first
i
ll
wait
for
you
both
he
was
aware
that
she
glanced
at
him
intently
as
you
please
i
ll
bring
her
down
at
she
opened
the
door
and
as
she
went
in
he
heard
her
say
no
sophy
don
t
go
i
want
you
the
rest
of
darrow
s
day
was
a
succession
of
empty
and
agitating
scenes
on
his
way
down
to
givre
before
he
had
seen
effie
leath
he
had
pictured
somewhat
sentimentally
the
joy
of
the
moment
when
he
should
take
her
in
his
arms
and
receive
her
first
filial
kiss
everything
in
him
that
egotistically
craved
for
rest
stability
a
comfortably
organized
all
the
instincts
of
the
man
who
has
sufficiently
wooed
and
wandered
combined
to
throw
a
charm
about
the
figure
of
the
child
who
might
who
should
have
been
his
effie
came
to
him
trailing
the
cloud
of
glory
of
his
first
romance
giving
him
back
the
magic
hour
he
had
missed
and
mourned
and
how
different
the
realization
of
his
dream
had
been
the
child
s
radiant
welcome
her
unquestioning
acceptance
of
this
new
figure
in
the
family
group
had
been
all
that
he
had
hoped
and
fancied
if
mother
was
so
awfully
happy
about
it
and
owen
and
granny
too
how
nice
and
cosy
and
comfortable
it
was
going
to
be
for
all
of
them
her
beaming
look
seemed
to
say
and
then
suddenly
the
small
pink
fingers
he
had
been
kissing
were
laid
on
the
one
flaw
in
the
circle
on
the
one
point
which
must
be
settled
before
effie
could
with
complete
unqualified
assurance
admit
the
to
full
equality
with
the
other
gods
of
her
olympus
and
is
sophy
awfully
happy
about
it
too
she
had
asked
loosening
her
hold
on
darrow
s
neck
to
tilt
back
her
head
and
include
her
mother
in
her
questioning
look
why
dearest
didn
t
you
see
she
was
anna
had
exclaimed
leaning
to
the
group
with
radiant
eyes
i
think
i
should
like
to
ask
her
the
child
rejoined
after
a
minute
s
shy
consideration
and
as
darrow
set
her
down
her
mother
laughed
do
darling
do
run
off
at
once
and
tell
her
we
expect
her
to
be
awfully
happy
the
scene
had
been
succeeded
by
others
less
poignant
but
almost
as
trying
darrow
cursed
his
luck
in
having
at
such
a
moment
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
a
houseful
of
interested
observers
the
state
of
being
engaged
in
itself
an
absurd
enough
predicament
even
to
a
man
only
intermittently
exposed
became
intolerable
under
the
continuous
scrutiny
of
a
small
circle
quivering
with
participation
darrow
was
furthermore
aware
that
though
the
case
of
the
other
couple
ought
to
have
made
his
own
less
conspicuous
it
was
rather
they
who
found
a
refuge
in
the
shadow
of
his
prominence
madame
de
chantelle
though
she
had
consented
to
owen
s
engagement
and
formally
welcomed
his
betrothed
was
nevertheless
not
sorry
to
show
by
her
reception
of
darrow
of
what
degrees
of
cordiality
she
was
capable
miss
painter
having
won
the
day
for
owen
was
also
free
to
turn
her
attention
to
the
newer
candidate
for
her
sympathy
and
darrow
and
anna
found
themselves
immersed
in
a
warm
bath
of
sentimental
curiosity
it
was
a
relief
to
darrow
that
he
was
under
a
positive
obligation
to
end
his
visit
within
the
next
hours
when
he
left
london
his
ambassador
had
accorded
him
a
ten
days
leave
his
fate
being
definitely
settled
and
openly
published
he
had
no
reason
for
asking
to
have
the
time
prolonged
and
when
it
was
over
he
was
to
return
to
his
post
till
the
time
fixed
for
taking
up
his
new
duties
anna
and
he
had
therefore
decided
to
be
married
in
paris
a
day
or
two
before
the
departure
of
the
steamer
which
was
to
take
them
to
south
america
and
anna
shortly
after
his
return
to
england
was
to
go
up
to
paris
and
begin
her
own
preparations
in
honour
of
the
double
betrothal
effie
and
miss
viner
were
to
appear
that
evening
at
dinner
and
darrow
on
leaving
his
room
met
the
little
girl
springing
down
the
stairs
her
white
ruffles
and
bows
making
her
look
like
a
daisy
with
her
yellow
hair
for
its
centre
sophy
viner
was
behind
her
pupil
and
as
she
came
into
the
light
darrow
noticed
a
change
in
her
appearance
and
wondered
vaguely
why
she
looked
suddenly
younger
more
vivid
more
like
the
little
luminous
ghost
of
his
paris
memories
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
appeared
at
dinner
since
his
arrival
at
givre
and
the
first
time
consequently
that
he
had
seen
her
in
evening
dress
she
was
still
at
the
age
when
the
least
adornment
embellishes
and
no
doubt
the
mere
uncovering
of
her
young
throat
and
neck
had
given
her
back
her
former
brightness
but
a
second
glance
showed
a
more
precise
reason
for
his
impression
vaguely
though
he
retained
such
details
he
felt
sure
she
was
wearing
the
dress
he
had
seen
her
in
every
evening
in
paris
it
was
a
simple
enough
dress
black
and
transparent
on
the
arms
and
shoulders
and
he
would
probably
not
have
recognized
it
if
she
had
not
called
his
attention
to
it
in
paris
by
confessing
that
she
hadn
t
any
other
the
same
dress
that
proves
that
she
s
forgotten
was
his
first
thought
but
the
next
moment
with
a
pang
of
compunction
he
said
to
himself
that
she
had
probably
put
it
on
for
the
same
reason
as
before
simply
because
she
hadn
t
any
other
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
and
for
an
instant
above
effie
s
bobbing
head
she
gave
him
back
his
look
in
a
full
bright
gaze
oh
there
s
owen
effie
cried
and
whirled
away
down
the
gallery
to
the
door
from
which
her
was
emerging
as
owen
bent
to
catch
her
sophy
viner
turned
abruptly
back
to
darrow
you
too
she
said
with
a
quick
laugh
i
didn
t
know
and
as
owen
came
up
to
them
she
added
in
a
tone
that
might
have
been
meant
to
reach
his
ear
i
wish
you
all
the
luck
that
we
can
spare
about
the
which
effie
with
miss
viner
s
aid
had
lavishly
garlanded
the
little
party
had
an
air
of
somewhat
festivity
in
spite
of
flowers
champagne
and
a
unanimous
attempt
at
ease
there
were
frequent
lapses
in
the
talk
and
moments
of
nervous
groping
for
new
subjects
miss
painter
alone
seemed
not
only
unaffected
by
the
general
perturbation
but
as
tightly
sealed
up
in
her
unconsciousness
of
it
as
a
diver
in
his
bell
to
darrow
s
strained
attention
even
owen
s
gusts
of
gaiety
seemed
to
betray
an
inward
sense
of
insecurity
after
dinner
however
at
the
piano
he
broke
into
a
mood
of
extravagant
hilarity
and
flooded
the
room
with
the
splash
and
ripple
of
his
music
darrow
sunk
in
a
sofa
corner
in
the
lee
of
miss
painter
s
granite
bulk
smoked
and
listened
in
silence
his
eyes
moving
from
one
figure
to
another
madame
de
chantelle
in
her
armchair
near
the
fire
clasped
her
little
granddaughter
to
her
with
the
gesture
of
a
niobe
and
anna
seated
near
them
had
fallen
into
one
of
the
attitudes
of
vivid
calm
which
seemed
to
darrow
to
express
her
inmost
quality
sophy
viner
after
moving
uncertainly
about
the
room
had
placed
herself
beyond
leath
in
a
chair
near
the
piano
where
she
sat
with
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
attached
to
the
musician
in
the
same
rapt
fixity
of
attention
with
which
she
had
followed
the
players
at
the
francais
the
accident
of
her
having
fallen
into
the
same
attitude
and
of
her
wearing
the
same
dress
gave
darrow
as
he
watched
her
a
strange
sense
of
double
consciousness
to
escape
from
it
his
glance
turned
back
to
anna
but
from
the
point
at
which
he
was
placed
his
eyes
could
not
take
in
the
one
face
without
the
other
and
that
renewed
the
disturbing
duality
of
the
impression
suddenly
owen
broke
off
with
a
crash
of
chords
and
jumped
to
his
feet
what
s
the
use
of
this
with
such
a
moon
to
say
it
for
us
behind
the
uncurtained
window
a
low
golden
orb
hung
like
a
ripe
fruit
against
the
glass
yes
let
s
go
out
and
listen
anna
answered
owen
threw
open
the
window
and
with
his
gesture
a
fold
of
the
heavy
sky
seemed
to
droop
into
the
room
like
a
curtain
the
air
that
entered
with
it
had
a
frosty
edge
and
anna
bade
effie
run
to
the
hall
for
wraps
darrow
said
you
must
have
one
too
and
started
toward
the
door
but
sophy
following
her
pupil
cried
back
we
ll
bring
things
for
owen
had
followed
her
and
in
a
moment
the
three
reappeared
and
the
party
went
out
on
the
terrace
the
deep
blue
purity
of
the
night
was
unveiled
by
mist
and
the
moonlight
rimmed
the
edges
of
the
trees
with
a
silver
blur
and
blanched
to
unnatural
whiteness
the
statues
against
their
walls
of
shade
darrow
and
anna
with
effie
between
them
strolled
to
the
farther
corner
of
the
terrace
below
them
between
the
fringes
of
the
park
the
lawn
sloped
dimly
to
the
fields
above
the
river
for
a
few
minutes
they
stood
silently
side
by
side
touched
to
peace
beneath
the
trembling
beauty
of
the
sky
when
they
turned
back
darrow
saw
that
owen
and
sophy
viner
who
had
gone
down
the
steps
to
the
garden
were
also
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
house
as
they
advanced
sophy
paused
in
a
patch
of
moonlight
between
the
sharp
shadows
of
the
yews
and
darrow
noticed
that
she
had
thrown
over
her
shoulders
a
long
cloak
of
some
light
colour
which
suddenly
evoked
her
image
as
she
had
entered
the
restaurant
at
his
side
on
the
night
of
their
first
dinner
in
paris
a
moment
later
they
were
all
together
again
on
the
terrace
and
when
they
the
the
older
ladies
were
on
their
way
to
bed
effie
emboldened
by
the
privileges
of
the
evening
was
for
coaxing
owen
to
round
it
off
with
a
game
of
forfeits
or
some
such
reckless
climax
but
sophy
resuming
her
professional
role
sounded
the
summons
to
bed
in
her
pupil
s
wake
she
made
her
round
of
but
when
she
proffered
her
hand
to
anna
the
latter
ignoring
the
gesture
held
out
both
arms
dear
child
she
said
impulsively
and
drew
the
girl
to
her
kiss
book
iv

the
next
day
was
darrow
s
last
at
givre
and
foreseeing
that
the
afternoon
and
evening
would
have
to
be
given
to
the
family
he
had
asked
anna
to
devote
an
early
hour
to
the
final
consideration
of
their
plans
he
was
to
meet
her
in
the
brown
at
ten
and
they
were
to
walk
down
to
the
river
and
talk
over
their
future
in
the
little
pavilion
abutting
on
the
wall
of
the
park
it
was
just
a
week
since
his
arrival
at
givre
and
anna
wished
before
he
left
to
return
to
the
place
where
they
had
sat
on
their
first
afternoon
together
her
sensitiveness
to
the
appeal
of
inanimate
things
to
the
colour
and
texture
of
whatever
wove
itself
into
the
substance
of
her
emotion
made
her
want
to
hear
darrow
s
voice
and
to
feel
his
eyes
on
her
in
the
spot
where
bliss
had
first
flowed
into
her
heart
that
bliss
in
the
interval
had
wound
itself
into
every
fold
of
her
being
passing
in
the
first
days
from
a
high
shy
tenderness
to
the
rush
of
a
secret
surrender
it
had
gradually
widened
and
deepened
to
flow
on
in
redoubled
beauty
she
thought
she
now
knew
exactly
how
and
why
she
loved
darrow
and
she
could
see
her
whole
sky
reflected
in
the
deep
and
tranquil
current
of
her
love
early
the
next
day
in
her
she
was
glancing
through
the
letters
which
it
was
effie
s
morning
privilege
to
carry
up
to
her
effie
meanwhile
circled
inquisitively
about
the
room
where
there
was
always
something
new
to
engage
her
infant
fancy
and
anna
looking
up
saw
her
suddenly
arrested
before
a
photograph
of
darrow
which
the
day
before
had
taken
its
place
on
the
anna
held
out
her
arms
with
a
faint
blush
you
do
like
him
don
t
you
dear
oh
most
awfully
dearest
effie
against
her
breast
leaned
back
to
assure
her
with
a
limpid
look
and
so
do
granny
and
owen
and
i
do
think
sophy
does
too
she
added
after
a
moment
s
earnest
pondering
i
hope
so
anna
laughed
she
checked
the
impulse
to
continue
has
she
talked
to
you
about
him
that
you
re
so
sure
she
did
not
know
what
had
made
the
question
spring
to
her
lips
but
she
was
glad
she
had
closed
them
before
pronouncing
it
nothing
could
have
been
more
distasteful
to
her
than
to
clear
up
such
obscurities
by
turning
on
them
the
tiny
flame
of
her
daughter
s
observation
and
what
after
all
now
that
owen
s
happiness
was
secured
did
it
matter
if
there
were
certain
reserves
in
darrow
s
approval
of
his
marriage
a
knock
on
the
door
made
anna
glance
at
the
clock
there
s
nurse
to
carry
you
it
s
sophy
s
knock
the
little
girl
answered
jumping
down
to
open
the
door
and
miss
viner
in
fact
stood
on
the
threshold
come
in
anna
said
with
a
smile
instantly
remarking
how
pale
she
looked
may
effie
go
out
for
a
turn
with
nurse
the
girl
asked
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
a
of
course
this
ought
to
be
your
holiday
as
yesterday
was
effie
s
run
off
dear
she
added
stooping
to
kiss
the
little
girl
when
the
door
had
closed
she
turned
back
to
sophy
viner
with
a
look
that
sought
her
confidence
i
m
so
glad
you
came
my
dear
we
ve
got
so
many
things
to
talk
about
just
you
and
i
the
confused
intercourse
of
the
last
days
had
in
fact
left
little
time
for
any
speech
with
sophy
but
such
as
related
to
her
marriage
and
the
means
of
overcoming
madame
de
chantelle
s
opposition
to
it
anna
had
exacted
of
owen
that
no
one
not
even
sophy
viner
should
be
given
a
hint
of
her
own
projects
till
all
contingent
questions
had
been
disposed
of
she
had
felt
from
the
outset
a
secret
reluctance
to
intrude
her
securer
happiness
on
the
doubts
and
fears
of
the
young
pair
from
the
to
which
she
had
dropped
back
she
pointed
to
darrow
s
chair
come
and
sit
by
me
dear
i
wanted
to
see
you
alone
there
s
so
much
to
say
that
i
hardly
know
where
to
she
leaned
forward
her
hands
clasped
on
the
arms
of
the
sofa
her
eyes
bent
smilingly
on
sophy
s
as
she
did
so
she
noticed
that
the
girl
s
unusual
pallour
was
partly
due
to
the
slight
veil
of
powder
on
her
face
the
discovery
was
distinctly
disagreeable
anna
had
never
before
noticed
on
sophy
s
part
any
recourse
to
cosmetics
and
much
as
she
wished
to
think
herself
exempt
from
prejudices
she
suddenly
became
aware
that
she
did
not
like
her
daughter
s
governess
to
have
a
powdered
face
then
she
reflected
that
the
girl
who
sat
opposite
her
was
no
longer
effie
s
governess
but
her
own
future
and
she
wondered
whether
miss
viner
had
chosen
this
odd
way
of
celebrating
her
independence
and
whether
as
owen
leath
she
would
present
to
the
world
a
bedizened
countenance
this
idea
was
scarcely
less
distasteful
than
the
other
and
for
a
moment
anna
continued
to
consider
her
without
speaking
then
in
a
flash
the
truth
came
to
her
miss
viner
had
powdered
her
face
because
miss
viner
had
been
crying
anna
leaned
forward
impulsively
my
dear
child
what
s
the
matter
she
saw
the
girl
s
blood
rush
up
under
the
white
mask
and
hastened
on
please
don
t
be
afraid
to
tell
me
i
do
so
want
you
to
feel
that
you
can
trust
me
as
owen
does
and
you
know
you
mustn
t
mind
if
just
at
first
madame
de
chantelle
occasionally
she
spoke
eagerly
persuasively
almost
on
a
note
of
pleading
she
had
in
truth
so
many
reasons
for
wanting
sophy
to
like
her
her
love
for
owen
her
solicitude
for
effie
and
her
own
sense
of
the
girl
s
fine
mettle
she
had
always
felt
a
romantic
and
almost
humble
admiration
for
those
members
of
her
sex
who
from
force
of
will
or
the
constraint
of
circumstances
had
plunged
into
the
conflict
from
which
fate
had
so
persistently
excluded
her
there
were
even
moments
when
she
fancied
herself
vaguely
to
blame
for
her
immunity
and
felt
that
she
ought
somehow
to
have
affronted
the
perils
and
hardships
which
refused
to
come
to
her
and
now
as
she
sat
looking
at
sophy
viner
so
small
so
slight
so
visibly
defenceless
and
undone
she
still
felt
through
all
the
superiority
of
her
worldly
advantages
and
her
seeming
maturity
the
same
odd
sense
of
ignorance
and
inexperience
she
could
not
have
said
what
there
was
in
the
girl
s
manner
and
expression
to
give
her
this
feeling
but
she
was
reminded
as
she
looked
at
sophy
viner
of
the
other
girls
she
had
known
in
her
youth
the
girls
who
seemed
possessed
of
a
secret
she
had
missed
yes
sophy
viner
had
their
look
almost
the
obscurely
menacing
look
of
kitty
mayne
anna
with
an
inward
smile
brushed
aside
the
image
of
this
forgotten
rival
but
she
had
felt
deep
down
a
twinge
of
the
old
pain
and
she
was
sorry
that
even
for
the
flash
of
a
thought
owen
s
betrothed
should
have
reminded
her
of
so
different
a
woman
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
girl
s
when
his
grandmother
sees
how
happy
owen
is
she
ll
be
quite
happy
herself
if
it
s
only
that
don
t
be
distressed
just
trust
to
owen
and
the
sophy
viner
with
an
almost
imperceptible
recoil
of
her
whole
slight
person
had
drawn
her
hand
from
under
the
palm
enclosing
it
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
the
of
course
we
ve
all
so
many
plans
to
make
and
to
fit
into
each
other
s
please
let
s
begin
with
the
girl
paused
a
moment
her
hands
clasped
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
her
lids
dropped
under
anna
s
gaze
then
she
said
i
should
like
to
make
no
plans
at
all
just
yet
no
plans
no
i
should
like
to
go
away
my
friends
the
farlows
would
let
me
go
to
them
her
voice
grew
firmer
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
add
i
should
like
to
leave
today
if
you
don
t
anna
listened
with
a
rising
wonder
you
want
to
leave
givre
at
once
she
gave
the
idea
a
moment
s
swift
consideration
you
prefer
to
be
with
your
friends
till
your
marriage
i
understand
that
but
surely
you
needn
t
rush
off
today
there
are
so
many
details
to
discuss
and
before
long
you
know
i
shall
be
going
away
yes
i
the
girl
was
evidently
trying
to
steady
her
voice
but
i
should
like
to
wait
a
few
days
to
have
a
little
more
time
to
anna
continued
to
consider
her
kindly
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
care
to
say
why
she
wished
to
leave
givre
so
suddenly
but
her
disturbed
face
and
shaken
voice
betrayed
a
more
pressing
motive
than
the
natural
desire
to
spend
the
weeks
before
her
marriage
under
her
old
friends
roof
since
she
had
made
no
response
to
the
allusion
to
madame
de
chantelle
anna
could
but
conjecture
that
she
had
had
a
passing
disagreement
with
owen
and
if
this
were
so
random
interference
might
do
more
harm
than
good
my
dear
child
if
you
really
want
to
go
at
once
i
sha
n
t
of
course
urge
you
to
stay
i
suppose
you
have
spoken
to
owen
no
not
yet
anna
threw
an
astonished
glance
at
her
you
mean
to
say
you
haven
t
told
him
i
wanted
to
tell
you
first
i
thought
i
ought
to
on
account
of
her
look
cleared
as
she
put
forth
this
reason
oh
effie
anna
s
smile
brushed
away
the
scruple
owen
has
a
right
to
ask
that
you
should
consider
him
before
you
think
of
his
sister
of
course
you
shall
do
just
as
you
wish
she
went
on
after
another
thoughtful
interval
oh
thank
you
sophy
viner
murmured
and
rose
to
her
feet
anna
rose
also
vaguely
seeking
for
some
word
that
should
break
down
the
girl
s
resistance
you
ll
tell
owen
at
once
she
finally
asked
miss
viner
instead
of
replying
stood
before
her
in
manifest
uncertainty
and
as
she
did
so
there
was
a
light
tap
on
the
door
and
owen
leath
walked
into
the
room
anna
s
first
glance
told
her
that
his
face
was
unclouded
he
met
her
greeting
with
his
happiest
smile
and
turned
to
lift
sophy
s
hand
to
his
lips
the
perception
that
he
was
utterly
unconscious
of
any
cause
for
miss
viner
s
agitation
came
to
his
with
a
sharp
thrill
of
surprise
darrow
s
looking
for
you
he
said
to
her
he
asked
me
to
remind
you
that
you
d
promised
to
go
for
a
walk
with
anna
glanced
at
the
clock
i
ll
go
down
she
waited
and
looked
again
at
sophy
viner
whose
troubled
eyes
seemed
to
commit
their
message
to
her
you
d
better
tell
owen
my
owen
s
look
also
turned
on
the
girl
tell
me
what
why
what
s
happened
anna
summoned
a
laugh
to
ease
the
vague
tension
of
the
moment
don
t
look
so
startled
nothing
except
that
sophy
proposes
to
desert
us
for
a
while
for
the
owen
s
brow
cleared
i
was
afraid
she
d
run
off
before
he
glanced
at
anna
do
please
keep
her
here
as
long
as
you
can
sophy
intervened
mrs
leath
s
already
given
me
leave
to
already
to
go
when
today
said
sophy
in
a
low
tone
her
eyes
on
anna
s
today
why
on
earth
should
you
go
today
owen
dropped
back
a
step
or
two
flushing
and
paling
under
his
bewildered
frown
his
eyes
seemed
to
search
the
girl
more
closely
something
s
he
too
looked
at
his
i
suppose
she
must
have
told
you
what
it
is
anna
was
struck
by
the
suddenness
and
vehemence
of
his
appeal
it
was
as
though
some
smouldering
apprehension
had
lain
close
under
the
surface
of
his
security
she
s
told
me
nothing
except
that
she
wishes
to
be
with
her
friends
it
s
quite
natural
that
she
should
want
to
go
to
owen
visibly
controlled
himself
of
course
quite
he
spoke
to
sophy
but
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
so
why
did
you
come
first
to
my
anna
intervened
with
her
calm
smile
that
seems
to
me
quite
natural
too
sophy
was
considerate
enough
to
tell
me
first
because
of
he
weighed
it
very
well
then
that
s
quite
natural
as
you
say
and
of
course
she
must
do
exactly
as
she
he
still
kept
his
eyes
on
the
girl
tomorrow
he
abruptly
announced
i
shall
go
up
to
paris
to
see
oh
no
no
she
protested
owen
turned
back
to
anna
now
do
you
say
that
nothing
s
happened
under
the
influence
of
his
agitation
anna
felt
a
vague
tightening
of
the
heart
she
seemed
to
herself
like
some
one
in
a
dark
room
about
whom
unseen
presences
are
groping
if
it
s
anything
that
sophy
wishes
to
tell
you
no
doubt
she
ll
do
so
i
m
going
down
now
and
i
ll
leave
you
here
to
talk
it
over
by
as
she
moved
to
the
door
the
girl
caught
up
with
her
but
there
s
nothing
to
tell
why
should
there
be
i
ve
explained
that
i
simply
want
to
be
her
look
seemed
to
detain
leath
owen
broke
in
is
that
why
i
mayn
t
go
up
tomorrow
not
tomorrow
then
when
may
i
later
in
a
little
while
a
few
days
in
how
many
days
owen
his
interposed
but
he
seemed
no
longer
aware
of
her
if
you
go
away
today
the
day
that
our
engagement
s
made
known
it
s
only
fair
he
persisted
that
you
should
tell
me
when
i
am
to
see
sophy
s
eyes
wavered
between
the
two
and
dropped
down
wearily
it
s
you
who
are
not
fair
when
i
ve
said
i
wanted
to
be
but
why
should
my
coming
disturb
you
i
m
not
asking
now
to
come
tomorrow
i
only
ask
you
not
to
leave
without
telling
me
when
i
m
to
see
owen
i
don
t
understand
you
his
exclaimed
you
don
t
understand
my
asking
for
some
explanation
some
assurance
when
i
m
left
in
this
way
without
a
word
without
a
sign
all
i
ask
her
to
tell
me
is
when
she
ll
see
anna
turned
back
to
sophy
viner
who
stood
straight
and
tremulous
between
the
two
after
all
my
dear
he
s
not
unreasonable
i
ll
write
i
ll
write
the
girl
repeated
what
will
you
write
he
pressed
her
vehemently
owen
anna
exclaimed
you
are
unreasonable
he
turned
from
sophy
to
his
i
only
want
her
to
say
what
she
means
that
she
s
going
to
write
to
break
off
our
engagement
isn
t
that
what
you
re
going
away
for
anna
felt
the
contagion
of
his
excitement
she
looked
at
sophy
who
stood
motionless
her
lips
set
her
whole
face
drawn
to
a
silent
fixity
of
resistance
you
ought
to
speak
my
dear
you
ought
to
answer
i
only
ask
him
to
wait
yes
owen
broke
in
and
you
won
t
say
how
long
both
instinctively
addressed
themselves
to
anna
who
stood
nearly
as
shaken
as
themselves
between
the
double
shock
of
their
struggle
she
looked
again
from
sophy
s
inscrutable
eyes
to
owen
s
stormy
features
then
she
said
what
can
i
do
when
there
s
clearly
something
between
you
that
i
don
t
know
about
oh
if
it
were
between
us
can
t
you
see
it
s
outside
of
us
outside
of
her
dragging
at
her
dragging
her
away
from
me
owen
wheeled
round
again
upon
his
anna
turned
from
him
to
the
girl
is
it
true
that
you
want
to
break
your
engagement
if
you
do
you
ought
to
tell
him
owen
burst
into
a
laugh
she
doesn
t
dare
to
she
s
afraid
i
ll
guess
the
reason
a
faint
sound
escaped
from
sophy
s
lips
but
she
kept
them
close
on
whatever
answer
she
had
ready
if
she
doesn
t
wish
to
marry
you
why
should
she
be
afraid
to
have
you
know
the
reason
she
s
afraid
to
have
you
know
it
not
me
to
have
me
know
it
he
laughed
again
and
anna
at
his
laugh
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
indignation
owen
you
must
explain
what
you
mean
he
looked
at
her
hard
before
answering
then
ask
darrow
he
said
owen
owen
sophy
viner
murmured
xxiv
anna
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
it
had
become
apparent
to
her
in
a
flash
that
owen
s
retort
though
it
startled
sophy
did
not
take
her
by
surprise
and
the
discovery
shot
its
light
along
dark
distances
of
fear
the
immediate
inference
was
that
owen
had
guessed
the
reason
of
darrow
s
disapproval
of
his
marriage
or
that
at
least
he
suspected
sophy
viner
of
knowing
and
dreading
it
this
confirmation
of
her
own
obscure
doubt
sent
a
tremor
of
alarm
through
anna
for
a
moment
she
felt
like
exclaiming
all
this
is
really
no
business
of
mine
and
i
refuse
to
have
you
mix
me
up
in
it
but
her
secret
fear
held
her
fast
sophy
viner
was
the
first
to
speak
i
should
like
to
go
now
she
said
in
a
low
voice
taking
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
her
tone
woke
anna
to
the
sense
of
her
own
share
in
the
situation
i
quite
agree
with
you
my
dear
that
it
s
useless
to
carry
on
this
discussion
but
since
darrow
s
name
has
been
brought
into
it
for
reasons
which
i
fail
to
guess
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
re
both
mistaken
if
you
think
he
s
not
in
sympathy
with
your
marriage
if
that
s
what
owen
means
to
imply
the
idea
s
a
complete
she
spoke
the
words
deliberately
and
incisively
as
if
hoping
that
the
sound
of
their
utterance
would
stifle
the
whisper
in
her
bosom
sophy
s
only
answer
was
a
vague
murmur
and
a
movement
that
brought
her
nearer
to
the
door
but
before
she
could
reach
it
owen
had
placed
himself
in
her
way
i
don
t
mean
to
imply
what
you
think
he
said
addressing
his
but
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
girl
i
don
t
say
darrow
doesn
t
like
our
marriage
i
say
it
s
sophy
who
s
hated
it
since
darrow
s
been
here
he
brought
out
the
charge
in
a
tone
of
forced
composure
but
his
lips
were
white
and
he
grasped
the
doorknob
to
hide
the
tremor
of
his
hand
anna
s
anger
surged
up
with
her
fears
you
re
absurd
owen
i
don
t
know
why
i
listen
to
you
why
should
sophy
dislike
darrow
and
if
she
does
why
should
that
have
anything
to
do
with
her
wishing
to
break
her
engagement
i
don
t
say
she
dislikes
him
i
don
t
say
she
likes
him
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
they
say
to
each
other
when
they
re
shut
up
together
shut
up
together
alone
anna
stared
owen
seemed
like
a
man
in
delirium
such
an
exhibition
was
degrading
to
them
all
but
he
pushed
on
without
seeing
her
look
yes
the
first
evening
she
came
in
the
study
the
next
morning
early
in
the
park
yesterday
again
in
the
when
you
were
at
the
lodge
with
the
doctor
i
don
t
know
what
they
say
to
each
other
but
they
ve
taken
every
chance
they
could
to
say
it
and
to
say
it
when
they
thought
that
no
one
saw
anna
longed
to
silence
him
but
no
words
came
to
her
it
was
as
though
all
her
confused
apprehensions
had
suddenly
taken
definite
shape
there
was
something
yes
there
was
something
darrow
s
reticences
and
evasions
had
been
more
than
a
figment
of
her
doubts
the
next
instant
brought
a
recoil
of
pride
she
turned
indignantly
on
her
i
don
t
half
understand
what
you
ve
been
saying
but
what
you
seem
to
hint
is
so
preposterous
and
so
insulting
both
to
sophy
and
to
me
that
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
listen
to
you
any
though
her
tone
steadied
owen
she
perceived
at
once
that
it
would
not
deflect
him
from
his
purpose
he
spoke
less
vehemently
but
with
all
the
more
precision
how
can
it
be
preposterous
since
it
s
true
or
insulting
since
i
don
t
know
any
more
than
you
the
meaning
of
what
i
ve
been
seeing
if
you
ll
be
patient
with
me
i
ll
try
to
put
it
quietly
what
i
mean
is
that
sophy
has
completely
changed
since
she
met
darrow
here
and
that
having
noticed
the
change
i
m
hardly
to
blame
for
having
tried
to
find
out
its
anna
made
an
effort
to
answer
him
with
the
same
composure
you
re
to
blame
at
any
rate
for
so
recklessly
assuming
that
you
have
found
it
out
you
seem
to
forget
that
till
they
met
here
sophy
and
darrow
hardly
knew
each
if
so
it
s
all
the
stranger
that
they
ve
been
so
often
closeted
together
owen
owen
the
girl
sighed
out
he
turned
his
haggard
face
to
her
can
i
help
it
if
i
ve
seen
and
known
what
i
wasn
t
meant
to
for
god
s
sake
give
me
a
reason
any
reason
i
can
decently
make
out
with
is
it
my
fault
if
the
day
after
you
arrived
when
i
came
back
late
through
the
garden
the
curtains
of
the
study
hadn
t
been
drawn
and
i
saw
you
there
alone
with
darrow
anna
laughed
impatiently
really
owen
if
you
make
it
a
grievance
that
two
people
who
are
staying
in
the
same
house
should
be
seen
talking
together
they
were
not
talking
that
s
the
point
not
talking
how
do
you
know
you
could
hardly
hear
them
from
the
garden
no
but
i
could
see
he
was
sitting
at
my
desk
with
his
face
in
his
hands
she
was
standing
in
the
window
looking
away
from
him
he
waited
as
if
for
sophy
viner
s
answer
but
still
she
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
that
was
the
first
time
he
went
on
and
the
second
was
the
next
morning
in
the
park
it
was
natural
enough
their
meeting
there
sophy
had
gone
out
with
effie
and
effie
ran
back
to
look
for
me
she
told
me
she
d
left
sophy
and
darrow
in
the
path
that
leads
to
the
river
and
presently
we
saw
them
ahead
of
us
they
didn
t
see
us
at
first
because
they
were
standing
looking
at
each
other
and
this
time
they
were
not
speaking
either
we
came
up
close
before
they
heard
us
and
all
that
time
they
never
spoke
or
stopped
looking
at
each
other
after
that
i
began
to
wonder
and
so
i
watched
oh
owen
oh
i
only
had
to
wait
yesterday
when
i
motored
you
and
the
doctor
back
from
the
lodge
i
saw
sophy
coming
out
of
the
i
supposed
she
d
taken
shelter
from
the
rain
and
when
you
got
out
of
the
motor
i
strolled
back
down
the
avenue
to
meet
her
but
she
d
disappeared
she
must
have
taken
a
short
cut
and
come
into
the
house
by
the
side
door
i
don
t
know
why
i
went
on
to
the
i
suppose
it
was
what
you
d
call
spying
i
went
up
the
steps
and
found
the
room
empty
but
two
chairs
had
been
moved
out
from
the
wall
and
were
standing
near
the
table
and
one
of
the
chinese
screens
that
lie
on
it
had
dropped
to
the
anna
sounded
a
faint
note
of
irony
really
sophy
d
gone
there
for
shelter
and
she
dropped
a
screen
and
moved
a
chair
i
said
two
chairs
two
what
damning
evidence
of
i
don
t
know
what
simply
of
the
fact
that
darrow
d
been
there
with
her
as
i
looked
out
of
the
window
i
saw
him
close
by
walking
away
he
must
have
turned
the
corner
of
the
just
as
i
got
to
the
there
was
another
silence
during
which
anna
paused
not
only
to
collect
her
own
words
but
to
wait
for
sophy
viner
s
then
as
the
girl
made
no
sign
she
turned
to
her
i
ve
absolutely
nothing
to
say
to
all
this
but
perhaps
you
d
like
me
to
wait
and
hear
your
answer
sophy
raised
her
head
with
a
quick
flash
of
colour
i
ve
no
answer
either
except
that
owen
must
be
in
the
interval
since
she
had
last
spoken
she
seemed
to
have
regained
her
and
her
voice
rang
clear
with
a
cold
edge
of
anger
anna
looked
at
her
he
had
grown
extremely
pale
and
his
hand
fell
from
the
door
with
a
discouraged
gesture
that
s
all
then
you
won
t
give
me
any
reason
i
didn
t
suppose
it
was
necessary
to
give
you
or
any
one
else
a
reason
for
talking
with
a
friend
of
leath
s
under
leath
s
own
owen
hardly
seemed
to
feel
the
retort
he
kept
his
dogged
stare
on
her
face
i
won
t
ask
for
one
then
i
ll
only
ask
you
to
give
me
your
assurance
that
your
talks
with
darrow
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
your
suddenly
deciding
to
leave
she
hesitated
not
so
much
with
the
air
of
weighing
her
answer
as
of
questioning
his
right
to
exact
any
i
give
you
my
assurance
and
now
i
should
like
to
go
she
said
as
she
turned
away
anna
intervened
my
dear
i
think
you
ought
to
the
girl
drew
herself
up
with
a
faint
laugh
to
him
or
to
you
to
she
stiffened
i
ve
said
all
there
is
to
anna
drew
back
her
eyes
on
her
he
had
left
the
threshold
and
was
advancing
toward
sophy
viner
with
a
motion
of
desperate
appeal
but
as
he
did
so
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
a
moment
s
silence
fell
on
the
three
then
anna
said
come
in
darrow
came
into
the
room
seeing
the
three
together
he
looked
rapidly
from
one
to
the
other
then
he
turned
to
anna
with
a
smile
i
came
up
to
see
if
you
were
ready
but
please
send
me
off
if
i
m
not
his
look
his
voice
the
simple
sense
of
his
presence
restored
anna
s
shaken
balance
by
owen
s
side
he
looked
so
strong
so
urbane
so
experienced
that
the
lad
s
passionate
charges
dwindled
to
mere
boyish
vapourings
a
moment
ago
she
had
dreaded
darrow
s
coming
now
she
was
glad
that
he
was
there
she
turned
to
him
with
sudden
decision
come
in
please
i
want
you
to
hear
what
owen
has
been
she
caught
a
murmur
from
sophy
viner
but
disregarded
it
an
illuminating
impulse
urged
her
on
she
habitually
so
aware
of
her
own
lack
of
penetration
her
small
skill
in
reading
hidden
motives
and
detecting
secret
signals
now
felt
herself
mysteriously
inspired
she
addressed
herself
to
sophy
viner
it
s
much
better
for
you
both
that
this
absurd
question
should
be
cleared
up
then
turning
to
darrow
she
continued
for
some
reason
that
i
don
t
pretend
to
guess
owen
has
taken
it
into
his
head
that
you
ve
influenced
miss
viner
to
break
her
she
spoke
slowly
and
deliberately
because
she
wished
to
give
time
and
to
gain
it
time
for
darrow
and
sophy
to
receive
the
full
impact
of
what
she
was
saying
and
time
to
observe
its
full
effect
on
them
she
had
said
to
herself
if
there
s
nothing
between
them
they
ll
look
at
each
other
if
there
is
something
they
won
t
and
as
she
ceased
to
speak
she
felt
as
if
all
her
life
were
in
her
eyes
sophy
after
a
start
of
protest
remained
motionless
her
gaze
on
the
ground
darrow
his
face
grown
grave
glanced
slowly
from
owen
leath
to
anna
with
his
eyes
on
the
latter
he
asked
has
miss
viner
broken
her
engagement
a
moment
s
silence
followed
his
question
then
the
girl
looked
up
and
said
yes
owen
as
she
spoke
uttered
a
smothered
exclamation
and
walked
out
of
the
room
she
continued
to
stand
in
the
same
place
without
appearing
to
notice
his
departure
and
without
vouchsafing
an
additional
word
of
explanation
then
before
anna
could
find
a
cry
to
detain
her
she
too
turned
and
went
out
for
god
s
sake
what
s
happened
darrow
asked
but
anna
with
a
drop
of
the
heart
was
saying
to
herself
that
he
and
sophy
viner
had
not
looked
at
each
other
xxv
anna
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
eyes
on
the
door
darrow
s
questioning
gaze
was
still
on
her
and
she
said
to
herself
with
a
breath
if
only
he
doesn
t
come
near
me
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
suddenly
endowed
with
the
fatal
gift
of
reading
the
secret
sense
of
every
seemingly
spontaneous
look
and
movement
and
that
in
his
least
gesture
of
affection
she
would
detect
a
cold
design
for
a
moment
longer
he
continued
to
look
at
her
enquiringly
then
he
turned
away
and
took
up
his
habitual
stand
by
the
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
won
t
you
please
explain
he
said
i
can
t
explain
i
don
t
know
i
didn
t
even
know
till
she
told
you
that
she
really
meant
to
break
her
engagement
all
i
know
is
that
she
came
to
me
just
now
and
said
she
wished
to
leave
givre
today
and
that
owen
when
he
heard
of
it
for
she
hadn
t
told
him
at
once
accused
her
of
going
away
with
the
secret
intention
of
throwing
him
and
you
think
it
s
a
definite
break
she
perceived
as
she
spoke
that
his
brow
had
cleared
how
should
i
know
perhaps
you
can
tell
i
she
fancied
his
face
clouded
again
but
he
did
not
move
from
his
tranquil
attitude
as
i
told
you
she
went
on
owen
has
worked
himself
up
to
imagining
that
for
some
mysterious
reason
you
ve
influenced
sophy
against
darrow
still
visibly
wondered
it
must
indeed
be
a
mysterious
reason
he
knows
how
slightly
i
know
miss
viner
why
should
he
imagine
anything
so
wildly
improbable
i
don
t
know
that
but
he
must
have
hinted
at
some
no
he
admits
he
doesn
t
know
your
reason
he
simply
says
that
sophy
s
manner
to
him
has
changed
since
she
came
back
to
givre
and
that
he
s
seen
you
together
several
times
in
the
park
the
i
don
t
know
where
talking
alone
in
a
way
that
seemed
confidential
almost
secret
and
he
draws
the
preposterous
conclusion
that
you
ve
used
your
influence
to
turn
her
against
my
influence
what
kind
of
influence
he
doesn
t
darrow
again
seemed
to
turn
over
the
facts
she
gave
him
his
face
remained
grave
but
without
the
least
trace
of
discomposure
and
what
does
miss
viner
say
she
says
it
s
perfectly
natural
that
she
should
occasionally
talk
to
my
friends
when
she
s
under
my
roof
and
refuses
to
give
him
any
other
that
at
least
is
perfectly
natural
anna
felt
her
cheeks
flush
as
she
answered
yes
but
there
is
something
something
some
reason
for
her
sudden
decision
to
break
her
engagement
i
can
understand
owen
s
feeling
sorry
as
i
am
for
his
way
of
showing
it
the
girl
owes
him
some
sort
of
explanation
and
as
long
as
she
refuses
to
give
it
his
imagination
is
sure
to
run
she
would
have
given
it
no
doubt
if
he
d
asked
it
in
a
different
i
don
t
defend
owen
s
tone
but
she
knew
what
it
was
before
she
accepted
him
she
knows
he
s
excitable
and
well
she
s
been
disciplining
him
a
little
probably
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
why
not
let
the
matter
rest
there
leave
owen
with
the
idea
that
you
have
been
the
cause
of
the
break
he
met
the
question
with
his
easy
smile
oh
as
to
that
leave
him
with
any
idea
of
me
he
chooses
but
leave
him
at
any
rate
free
she
echoed
in
surprise
simply
let
things
be
you
ve
surely
done
all
you
could
for
him
and
miss
viner
if
they
don
t
hit
it
off
it
s
their
own
affair
what
possible
motive
can
you
have
for
trying
to
interfere
now
her
gaze
widened
to
a
deeper
wonder
why
naturally
what
he
says
of
you
i
don
t
care
a
straw
what
he
says
of
me
in
such
a
situation
a
boy
in
love
will
snatch
at
the
most
reason
rather
than
face
the
mortifying
fact
that
the
lady
may
simply
be
tired
of
you
don
t
quite
understand
owen
things
go
deep
with
him
and
last
long
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
recover
from
his
other
unlucky
love
affair
he
s
romantic
and
extravagant
he
can
t
live
on
the
interest
of
his
feelings
he
worships
sophy
and
she
seemed
to
be
fond
of
him
if
she
s
changed
it
s
been
very
sudden
and
if
they
part
like
this
angrily
and
inarticulately
it
will
hurt
him
horribly
hurt
his
very
soul
but
that
as
you
say
is
between
the
two
what
concerns
me
is
his
associating
you
with
their
quarrel
owen
s
like
my
own
son
if
you
d
seen
him
when
i
first
came
here
you
d
know
why
we
were
like
two
prisoners
who
talk
to
each
other
by
tapping
on
the
wall
he
s
never
forgotten
it
nor
i
whether
he
breaks
with
sophy
or
whether
they
make
it
up
i
can
t
let
him
think
you
had
anything
to
do
with
she
raised
her
eyes
entreatingly
to
darrow
s
and
read
in
them
the
forbearance
of
the
man
resigned
to
the
discussion
of
problems
i
ll
do
whatever
you
want
me
to
he
said
but
i
don
t
yet
know
what
it
his
smile
seemed
to
charge
her
with
inconsequence
and
the
prick
to
her
pride
made
her
continue
after
all
it
s
not
so
unnatural
that
owen
knowing
you
and
sophy
to
be
almost
strangers
should
wonder
what
you
were
saying
to
each
other
when
he
saw
you
talking
she
felt
a
warning
tremor
as
she
spoke
as
though
some
instinct
deeper
than
reason
surged
up
in
defense
of
its
treasure
but
darrow
s
face
was
unstirred
save
by
the
flit
of
his
smile
well
my
dear
and
couldn
t
you
have
told
him
i
she
faltered
out
through
her
blush
you
seem
to
forget
one
and
all
of
you
the
position
you
put
me
in
when
i
came
down
here
your
appeal
to
me
to
see
owen
through
your
assurance
to
him
that
i
would
madame
de
chantelle
s
attempt
to
win
me
over
and
most
of
all
my
own
sense
of
the
fact
you
ve
just
recalled
to
me
the
importance
for
both
of
us
that
owen
should
like
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
get
as
much
light
as
i
could
on
the
whole
situation
and
the
obvious
way
of
doing
it
was
to
try
to
know
miss
viner
better
of
course
i
ve
talked
with
her
alone
i
ve
talked
with
her
as
often
as
i
could
i
ve
tried
my
best
to
find
out
if
you
were
right
in
encouraging
owen
to
marry
she
listened
with
a
growing
sense
of
reassurance
struggling
to
separate
the
abstract
sense
of
his
words
from
the
persuasion
in
which
his
eyes
and
voice
enveloped
them
i
see
i
do
see
she
murmured
you
must
see
also
that
i
could
hardly
say
this
to
owen
without
offending
him
still
more
and
perhaps
increasing
the
breach
between
miss
viner
and
himself
what
sort
of
figure
should
i
cut
if
i
told
him
i
d
been
trying
to
find
out
if
he
d
made
a
proper
choice
in
any
case
it
s
none
of
my
business
to
offer
an
explanation
of
what
she
justly
says
doesn
t
need
one
if
she
declines
to
speak
it
s
obviously
on
the
ground
that
owen
s
insinuations
are
absurd
and
that
surely
pledges
me
to
yes
yes
i
see
anna
repeated
but
i
don
t
want
you
to
explain
anything
to
you
haven
t
yet
told
me
what
you
do
she
hesitated
conscious
of
the
difficulty
of
justifying
her
request
then
i
want
you
to
speak
to
sophy
she
said
darrow
broke
into
an
incredulous
laugh
considering
what
my
previous
attempts
have
resulted
in
she
raised
her
eyes
quickly
they
haven
t
at
least
resulted
in
your
liking
her
less
in
your
thinking
less
well
of
her
than
you
ve
told
me
she
fancied
he
frowned
a
little
i
wonder
why
you
go
back
to
that
i
want
to
be
sure
i
owe
it
to
owen
won
t
you
tell
me
the
exact
impression
she
s
produced
on
you
i
have
told
you
i
like
miss
do
you
still
believe
she
s
in
love
with
owen
there
was
nothing
in
our
short
talks
to
throw
any
particular
light
on
you
still
believe
though
that
there
s
no
reason
why
he
shouldn
t
marry
her
again
he
betrayed
a
restrained
impatience
how
can
i
answer
that
without
knowing
her
reasons
for
breaking
with
him
that
s
just
what
i
want
you
to
find
out
from
and
why
in
the
world
should
she
tell
me
because
whatever
grievance
she
has
against
owen
she
can
certainly
have
none
against
me
she
can
t
want
to
have
owen
connect
me
in
his
mind
with
this
wretched
quarrel
and
she
must
see
that
he
will
until
he
s
convinced
you
ve
had
no
share
in
darrow
s
elbow
dropped
from
the
and
he
took
a
restless
step
or
two
across
the
room
then
he
halted
before
her
why
can
t
you
tell
her
this
yourself
don
t
you
see
he
eyed
her
intently
and
she
pressed
on
you
must
have
guessed
that
owen
s
jealous
of
jealous
of
me
the
blood
flew
up
under
his
brown
skin
blind
with
it
what
else
would
drive
him
to
this
folly
and
i
can
t
have
her
think
me
jealous
too
i
ve
said
all
i
could
short
of
making
her
think
so
and
she
s
refused
a
word
more
to
either
of
us
our
only
chance
now
is
that
she
should
listen
to
you
that
you
should
make
her
see
the
harm
her
silence
may
darrow
uttered
a
protesting
exclamation
it
s
all
too
preposterous
what
you
suggest
i
can
t
at
any
rate
appeal
to
her
on
such
a
ground
as
that
anna
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
appeal
to
her
on
the
ground
that
i
m
almost
owen
s
mother
and
that
any
estrangement
between
you
and
him
would
kill
me
she
knows
what
he
is
she
ll
understand
tell
her
to
say
anything
do
anything
she
wishes
but
not
to
go
away
without
speaking
not
to
leave
that
between
us
when
she
goes
she
drew
back
a
step
and
lifted
her
face
to
his
trying
to
look
into
his
eyes
more
deeply
than
she
had
ever
looked
but
before
she
could
discern
what
they
expressed
he
had
taken
hold
of
her
hands
and
bent
his
head
to
kiss
them
you
ll
see
her
you
ll
see
her
she
entreated
and
he
answered
i
ll
do
anything
in
the
world
you
want
me
xxvi
darrow
waited
alone
in
the
no
place
could
have
been
more
distasteful
as
the
scene
of
the
talk
that
lay
before
him
but
he
had
acceded
to
anna
s
suggestion
that
it
would
seem
more
natural
for
her
to
summon
sophy
viner
than
for
him
to
go
in
search
of
her
as
his
troubled
pacings
carried
him
back
and
forth
a
relentless
hand
seemed
to
be
tearing
away
all
the
tender
fibres
of
association
that
bound
him
to
the
peaceful
room
here
in
this
very
place
he
had
drunk
his
deepest
draughts
of
happiness
had
had
his
lips
at
the
of
its
overflowing
rivers
but
now
that
source
was
poisoned
and
he
would
taste
no
more
of
an
untainted
cup
for
a
moment
he
felt
an
actual
physical
anguish
then
his
nerves
hardened
for
the
coming
struggle
he
had
no
notion
of
what
awaited
him
but
after
the
first
instinctive
recoil
he
had
seen
in
a
flash
the
urgent
need
of
another
word
with
sophy
viner
he
had
been
insincere
in
letting
anna
think
that
he
had
consented
to
speak
because
she
asked
it
in
reality
he
had
been
feverishly
casting
about
for
the
pretext
she
had
given
him
and
for
some
reason
this
trivial
hypocrisy
weighed
on
him
more
than
all
his
heavy
burden
of
deceit
at
length
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
sophy
viner
entered
when
she
saw
him
she
paused
on
the
threshold
and
half
drew
back
i
was
told
that
leath
had
sent
for
mrs
leath
did
send
for
you
she
ll
be
here
presently
but
i
asked
her
to
let
me
see
you
he
spoke
very
gently
and
there
was
no
insincerity
in
his
gentleness
he
was
profoundly
moved
by
the
change
in
the
girl
s
appearance
at
sight
of
him
she
had
forced
a
smile
but
it
lit
up
her
wretchedness
like
a
held
to
a
dead
face
she
made
no
reply
and
darrow
went
on
you
must
understand
my
wanting
to
speak
to
you
after
what
i
was
told
just
she
interposed
with
a
gesture
of
protest
i
m
not
responsible
for
owen
s
ravings
of
course
he
broke
off
and
they
stood
facing
each
other
she
lifted
a
hand
and
pushed
back
her
loose
lock
with
the
gesture
that
was
burnt
into
his
memory
then
she
looked
about
her
and
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
well
you
ve
got
what
you
wanted
she
said
what
do
you
mean
by
what
i
wanted
my
engagement
s
broken
you
heard
me
say
why
do
you
say
that
s
what
i
wanted
all
i
wished
from
the
beginning
was
to
advise
you
to
help
you
as
best
i
could
that
s
what
you
ve
done
she
rejoined
you
ve
convinced
me
that
it
s
best
i
shouldn
t
marry
darrow
broke
into
a
despairing
laugh
at
the
very
moment
when
you
d
convinced
me
to
the
contrary
had
i
her
smile
flickered
up
well
i
really
believed
it
till
you
showed
me
warned
me
warned
you
that
i
d
be
miserable
if
i
married
a
man
i
didn
t
don
t
you
love
him
she
made
no
answer
and
darrow
started
up
and
walked
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
stopped
before
the
where
his
photograph
handsome
the
portrait
of
a
man
of
the
world
confident
of
his
ability
to
deal
adequately
with
the
most
delicate
situations
offered
its
huge
fatuity
to
his
gaze
he
turned
back
to
her
it
s
rather
hard
on
owen
isn
t
it
that
you
should
have
waited
until
now
to
tell
him
she
reflected
a
moment
before
answering
i
told
him
as
soon
as
i
knew
that
you
couldn
t
marry
him
knew
that
i
could
never
live
here
with
she
looked
about
the
room
as
though
the
very
walls
must
speak
for
her
for
a
moment
darrow
continued
to
search
her
face
perplexedly
then
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
disastrous
gaze
yes
she
said
and
stood
up
below
the
window
they
heard
effie
whistling
for
her
dogs
and
then
from
the
terrace
her
mother
calling
her
there
that
for
instance
sophy
viner
said
darrow
broke
out
it
s
i
who
ought
to
go
she
kept
her
small
pale
smile
what
good
would
that
do
any
of
us
now
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
good
god
he
groaned
how
could
i
tell
you
couldn
t
tell
we
neither
of
us
she
seemed
to
turn
the
problem
over
critically
after
all
it
might
have
been
you
instead
of
me
he
took
another
distracted
turn
about
the
room
and
coming
back
to
her
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
her
side
a
mocking
hand
seemed
to
dash
the
words
from
his
lips
there
was
nothing
on
earth
that
he
could
say
to
her
that
wasn
t
foolish
or
cruel
or
contemptible
my
dear
he
began
at
last
oughtn
t
you
at
any
rate
to
try
her
gaze
grew
grave
try
to
forget
you
he
flushed
to
the
forehead
i
meant
try
to
give
owen
more
time
to
give
him
a
chance
he
s
madly
in
love
with
you
all
the
good
that
s
in
him
is
in
your
hands
his
felt
that
from
the
first
and
she
thought
she
believed
she
thought
i
could
make
him
happy
would
she
think
so
now
now
i
don
t
say
now
but
later
time
modifies
rubs
out
more
quickly
than
you
think
go
away
but
let
him
hope
i
m
going
too
we
re
going
he
stumbled
on
the
plural
in
a
very
few
weeks
going
for
a
long
time
probably
what
you
re
thinking
of
now
may
never
happen
we
may
not
all
be
here
together
again
for
she
heard
him
out
in
silence
her
hands
clasped
on
her
knee
her
eyes
bent
on
them
for
me
she
said
you
ll
always
be
don
t
say
that
oh
don
t
things
change
people
change
you
ll
see
you
don
t
understand
i
don
t
want
anything
to
change
i
don
t
want
to
forget
to
rub
out
at
first
i
imagined
i
did
but
that
was
a
foolish
mistake
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
again
i
knew
it
it
s
not
being
here
with
you
that
i
m
afraid
of
in
the
sense
you
think
it
s
being
here
or
anywhere
with
she
stood
up
and
bent
her
tragic
smile
on
him
i
want
to
keep
you
all
to
the
only
words
that
came
to
him
were
futile
denunciations
of
his
folly
but
the
sense
of
their
futility
checked
them
on
his
lips
poor
child
you
poor
child
he
heard
himself
vainly
repeating
suddenly
he
felt
the
strong
reaction
of
reality
and
its
impetus
brought
him
to
his
feet
whatever
happens
i
intend
to
go
to
go
for
good
he
exclaimed
i
want
you
to
understand
that
oh
don
t
be
afraid
i
ll
find
a
reason
but
it
s
perfectly
clear
that
i
must
she
uttered
a
protesting
cry
go
away
you
don
t
you
see
that
that
would
tell
everything
drag
everybody
into
the
horror
he
found
no
answer
and
her
voice
dropped
back
to
its
calmer
note
what
good
would
your
going
do
do
you
suppose
it
would
change
anything
for
me
she
looked
at
him
with
a
musing
wistfulness
i
wonder
what
your
feeling
for
me
was
it
seems
queer
that
i
ve
never
really
known
i
suppose
we
don
t
know
much
about
that
kind
of
feeling
is
it
like
taking
a
drink
when
you
re
thirsty
i
used
to
feel
as
if
all
of
me
was
in
the
palm
of
your
hand
he
bowed
his
humbled
head
but
she
went
on
almost
exultantly
don
t
for
a
minute
think
i
m
sorry
it
was
worth
every
penny
it
cost
my
mistake
was
in
being
ashamed
just
at
first
of
its
having
cost
such
a
lot
i
tried
to
carry
it
off
as
a
joke
to
talk
of
it
to
myself
as
an
adventure
i
d
always
wanted
adventures
and
you
d
given
me
one
and
i
tried
to
take
your
attitude
about
it
to
play
the
game
and
convince
myself
that
i
hadn
t
risked
any
more
on
it
than
you
then
when
i
met
you
again
i
suddenly
saw
that
i
had
risked
more
but
that
i
d
won
more
too
such
worlds
i
d
been
trying
all
the
while
to
put
everything
i
could
between
us
now
i
want
to
sweep
everything
away
i
d
been
trying
to
forget
how
you
looked
now
i
want
to
remember
you
always
i
d
been
trying
not
to
hear
your
voice
now
i
never
want
to
hear
any
other
i
ve
made
my
choice
that
s
all
i
ve
had
you
and
i
mean
to
keep
her
face
was
shining
like
her
eyes
to
keep
you
hidden
away
here
she
ended
and
put
her
hand
upon
her
breast
after
she
had
left
him
darrow
continued
to
sit
motionless
staring
back
into
their
past
hitherto
it
had
lingered
on
the
edge
of
his
mind
in
a
vague
pink
blur
like
one
of
the
little
clouds
that
a
setting
sun
drops
from
its
disk
now
it
was
a
huge
looming
darkness
through
which
his
eyes
vainly
strained
the
whole
episode
was
still
obscure
to
him
save
where
here
and
there
as
they
talked
some
phrase
or
gesture
or
intonation
of
the
girl
s
had
lit
up
a
little
spot
in
the
night
she
had
said
i
wonder
what
your
feeling
for
me
was
and
he
found
himself
wondering
too
he
remembered
distinctly
enough
that
he
had
not
meant
the
perilous
passion
even
in
its
most
transient
form
to
play
a
part
in
their
relation
in
that
respect
his
attitude
had
been
above
reproach
she
was
an
unusually
original
and
attractive
creature
to
whom
he
had
wanted
to
give
a
few
days
of
harmless
pleasuring
and
who
was
alert
and
expert
enough
to
understand
his
intention
and
spare
him
the
boredom
of
hesitations
and
misinterpretations
that
had
been
his
first
impression
and
her
subsequent
demeanour
had
justified
it
she
had
been
from
the
outset
just
the
frank
and
easy
comrade
he
had
expected
to
find
her
was
it
he
then
who
in
the
sequel
had
grown
impatient
of
the
bounds
he
had
set
himself
was
it
his
wounded
vanity
that
seeking
balm
for
its
hurt
yearned
to
dip
deeper
into
the
healing
pool
of
her
compassion
in
his
confused
memory
of
the
situation
he
seemed
not
to
have
been
guiltless
of
such
yearnings
yet
for
the
first
few
days
the
experiment
had
been
perfectly
successful
her
enjoyment
had
been
unclouded
and
his
pleasure
in
it
undisturbed
it
was
very
gradually
he
seemed
to
see
that
a
shade
of
lassitude
had
crept
over
their
intercourse
perhaps
it
was
because
when
her
light
chatter
about
people
failed
he
found
she
had
no
other
fund
to
draw
on
or
perhaps
simply
because
of
the
sweetness
of
her
laugh
or
of
the
charm
of
the
gesture
with
which
one
day
in
the
woods
of
marly
she
had
tossed
off
her
hat
and
tilted
back
her
head
at
the
call
of
a
cuckoo
or
because
whenever
he
looked
at
her
unexpectedly
he
found
that
she
was
looking
at
him
and
did
not
want
him
to
know
it
or
perhaps
in
varying
degrees
because
of
all
these
things
that
there
had
come
a
moment
when
no
word
seemed
to
fly
high
enough
or
dive
deep
enough
to
utter
the
sense
of
each
gave
to
the
other
and
the
natural
substitute
for
speech
had
been
a
kiss
the
kiss
at
all
events
had
come
at
the
precise
moment
to
save
their
venture
from
disaster
they
had
reached
the
point
when
her
amazing
reminiscences
had
begun
to
flag
when
her
future
had
been
exhaustively
discussed
her
theatrical
prospects
minutely
studied
her
quarrel
with
murrett
retold
with
the
last
amplification
of
detail
and
when
perhaps
conscious
of
her
exhausted
resources
and
his
dwindling
interest
she
had
committed
the
fatal
error
of
saying
that
she
could
see
he
was
unhappy
and
entreating
him
to
tell
her
why
from
the
brink
of
estranging
confidences
and
from
the
risk
of
unfavourable
comparisons
his
gesture
had
snatched
her
back
to
safety
and
as
soon
as
he
had
kissed
her
he
felt
that
she
would
never
bore
him
again
she
was
one
of
the
elemental
creatures
whose
emotion
is
all
in
their
pulses
and
who
become
inexpressive
or
sentimental
when
they
try
to
turn
sensation
into
speech
his
caress
had
restored
her
to
her
natural
place
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
darrow
felt
as
if
he
had
clasped
a
tree
and
a
nymph
had
bloomed
from
it
the
mere
fact
of
not
having
to
listen
to
her
any
longer
added
immensely
to
her
charm
she
continued
of
course
to
talk
to
him
but
it
didn
t
matter
because
he
no
longer
made
any
effort
to
follow
her
words
but
let
her
voice
run
on
as
a
musical
undercurrent
to
his
thoughts
she
hadn
t
a
drop
of
poetry
in
her
but
she
had
some
of
the
qualities
that
create
it
in
others
and
in
moments
of
heat
the
imagination
does
not
always
feel
the
difference
lying
beside
her
in
the
shade
darrow
felt
her
presence
as
a
part
of
the
charmed
stillness
of
the
summer
woods
as
the
element
of
vague
that
suffused
his
senses
and
lulled
to
sleep
the
ache
of
wounded
pride
all
he
asked
of
her
as
yet
was
a
touch
on
the
hand
or
on
the
lips
and
that
she
should
let
him
go
on
lying
there
through
the
long
warm
hours
while
a
s
song
throbbed
like
a
fountain
and
the
summer
wind
stirred
in
the
trees
and
close
by
between
the
nearest
branches
and
the
brim
of
his
tilted
hat
a
slight
white
figure
gathered
up
all
the
floating
threads
of
joy
he
recalled
too
having
noticed
as
he
lay
staring
at
a
break
in
the
a
stream
of
mares
coming
up
the
sky
he
had
said
to
himself
it
will
rain
and
the
thought
had
made
the
air
seem
warmer
and
the
sun
more
vivid
on
her
hair
perhaps
if
the
mares
had
not
come
up
the
sky
their
adventure
might
have
had
no
sequel
but
the
cloud
brought
rain
and
next
morning
he
looked
out
of
his
window
into
a
cold
grey
blur
they
had
planned
an
excursion
down
the
seine
to
the
two
andelys
and
rouen
and
now
with
the
long
hours
on
their
hands
they
were
both
a
little
at
a
loss
there
was
the
louvre
of
course
and
the
luxembourg
but
he
had
tried
looking
at
pictures
with
her
she
had
first
so
persistently
admired
the
worst
things
and
then
so
frankly
lapsed
into
indifference
that
he
had
no
wish
to
repeat
the
experiment
so
they
went
out
aimlessly
and
took
a
cold
wet
walk
turning
at
length
into
the
deserted
arcades
of
the
palais
royal
and
finally
drifting
into
one
of
its
equally
deserted
restaurants
where
they
lunched
alone
and
somewhat
dolefully
served
by
a
wan
old
waiter
with
the
look
of
a
castaway
who
has
given
up
watching
for
a
sail
it
was
odd
how
the
waiter
s
face
came
back
to
him
perhaps
but
for
the
rain
it
might
never
have
happened
but
what
was
the
use
of
thinking
of
that
now
he
tried
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
more
urgent
issues
but
by
a
strange
perversity
of
association
every
detail
of
the
day
was
forcing
itself
on
his
mind
with
an
insistence
from
which
there
was
no
escape
reluctantly
he
relived
the
long
wet
walk
back
to
the
hotel
after
a
tedious
hour
at
a
cinematograph
show
on
the
boulevard
it
was
still
raining
when
they
withdrew
from
this
stale
spectacle
but
she
had
obstinately
refused
to
take
a
cab
had
even
on
the
way
insisted
on
loitering
under
the
dripping
awnings
of
and
poking
into
draughty
passages
and
finally
when
they
had
nearly
reached
their
destination
had
gone
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
they
should
turn
back
to
hunt
up
some
show
she
had
heard
of
in
a
theatre
at
the
batignolles
but
at
that
he
had
somewhat
irritably
protested
he
remembered
that
for
the
first
time
they
were
both
rather
irritable
and
vaguely
disposed
to
resist
one
another
s
suggestions
his
feet
were
wet
and
he
was
tired
of
walking
and
sick
of
the
smell
of
stuffy
unaired
theatres
and
he
had
said
he
must
really
get
back
to
write
some
letters
and
so
they
had
kept
on
to
the
hotel
xxvii
darrow
had
no
idea
how
long
he
had
sat
there
when
he
heard
anna
s
hand
on
the
door
the
effort
of
rising
and
of
composing
his
face
to
meet
her
gave
him
a
factitious
sense
of
he
said
to
himself
i
must
decide
on
something
and
that
lifted
him
a
hair
s
breadth
above
the
whirling
waters
she
came
in
with
a
lighter
step
and
he
instantly
perceived
that
something
unforeseen
and
reassuring
had
happened
she
s
been
with
me
she
came
and
found
me
on
the
terrace
we
ve
had
a
long
talk
and
she
s
explained
everything
i
feel
as
if
i
d
never
known
her
before
her
voice
was
so
moved
and
tender
that
it
checked
his
start
of
apprehension
she
s
explained
it
s
natural
isn
t
it
that
she
should
have
felt
a
little
sore
at
the
kind
of
inspection
she
s
been
subjected
to
oh
not
from
you
i
don
t
mean
that
but
madame
de
chantelle
s
opposition
and
her
sending
for
adelaide
painter
she
told
me
frankly
she
didn
t
care
to
owe
her
husband
to
adelaide
painter
she
thinks
now
that
her
annoyance
at
feeling
herself
so
talked
over
and
scrutinized
may
have
shown
itself
in
her
manner
to
owen
and
set
him
imagining
the
insane
things
he
did
i
understand
all
she
must
have
felt
and
i
agree
with
her
that
it
s
best
she
should
go
away
for
a
while
she
s
made
me
anna
summed
up
feel
as
if
i
d
been
dreadfully
and
obtuse
you
yes
as
if
i
d
treated
her
like
the
that
used
to
be
sent
down
here
on
approval
to
see
if
it
would
look
well
with
the
other
she
added
with
a
sudden
flush
of
enthusiasm
i
m
glad
she
s
got
it
in
her
to
make
one
feel
like
that
she
seemed
to
wait
for
darrow
to
agree
with
her
or
to
put
some
other
question
and
he
finally
found
voice
to
ask
then
you
think
it
s
not
a
final
break
i
hope
not
i
ve
never
hoped
it
more
i
had
a
word
with
owen
too
after
i
left
her
and
i
think
he
understands
that
he
must
let
her
go
without
insisting
on
any
positive
promise
she
s
excited
he
must
let
her
calm
down
again
she
waited
and
darrow
said
surely
you
can
make
him
see
she
ll
help
me
to
she
s
to
see
him
of
course
before
she
goes
she
starts
immediately
by
the
way
with
adelaide
painter
who
is
motoring
over
to
francheuil
to
catch
the
one
o
clock
express
and
who
of
course
knows
nothing
of
all
this
and
is
simply
to
be
told
that
sophy
has
been
sent
for
by
the
darrow
mutely
signed
his
comprehension
and
she
went
on
owen
is
particularly
anxious
that
neither
adelaide
nor
his
grandmother
should
have
the
least
inkling
of
what
s
happened
the
need
of
shielding
sophy
will
help
him
to
control
himself
he
s
coming
to
his
senses
poor
boy
he
s
ashamed
of
his
wild
talk
already
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
so
no
doubt
he
ll
tell
you
so
darrow
made
a
movement
of
protest
oh
as
to
that
the
thing
s
not
worth
another
or
another
thought
either
she
brightened
promise
me
you
won
t
even
think
of
it
promise
me
you
won
t
be
hard
on
him
he
was
finding
it
easier
to
smile
back
at
her
why
should
you
think
it
necessary
to
ask
my
indulgence
for
owen
she
hesitated
a
moment
her
eyes
wandering
from
him
then
they
came
back
with
a
smile
perhaps
because
i
need
it
for
for
yourself
i
mean
because
i
understand
better
how
one
can
torture
one
s
self
over
as
darrow
listened
the
tension
of
his
nerves
began
to
relax
her
gaze
so
grave
and
yet
so
sweet
was
like
a
deep
pool
into
which
he
could
plunge
and
hide
himself
from
the
hard
glare
of
his
misery
as
this
ecstatic
sense
enveloped
him
he
found
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
follow
her
words
and
to
frame
an
answer
but
what
did
anything
matter
except
that
her
voice
should
go
on
and
the
syllables
fall
like
soft
touches
on
his
tortured
brain
don
t
you
know
she
continued
the
bliss
of
waking
from
a
bad
dream
in
one
s
own
quiet
room
and
going
slowly
over
all
the
horror
without
being
afraid
of
it
any
more
that
s
what
i
m
doing
now
and
that
s
why
i
understand
owen
she
broke
off
and
he
felt
her
touch
on
his
arm
because
i
d
dreamed
the
horror
too
he
understood
her
then
and
stammered
you
forgive
me
and
let
me
tell
you
it
will
help
you
to
understand
owen
there
were
little
things
little
signs
once
i
had
begun
to
watch
for
them
your
reluctance
to
speak
about
her
her
reserve
with
you
a
sort
of
constraint
we
d
never
seen
in
her
before
she
laughed
up
at
him
and
with
her
hands
in
his
he
contrived
to
say
now
you
understand
why
oh
i
understand
of
course
i
understand
and
i
want
you
to
laugh
at
me
with
me
because
there
were
other
things
too
crazier
things
still
there
was
even
last
night
on
the
terrace
her
pink
cloak
her
pink
cloak
now
he
honestly
wondered
and
as
she
saw
it
she
blushed
you
ve
forgotten
about
the
cloak
the
pink
cloak
that
owen
saw
you
with
at
the
play
in
paris
yes
yes
i
was
mad
enough
for
that
it
does
me
good
to
laugh
about
it
now
but
you
ought
to
know
that
i
m
going
to
be
a
jealous
woman
a
ridiculously
jealous
woman
you
ought
to
be
warned
of
it
in
time
he
had
dropped
her
hands
and
she
leaned
close
and
lifted
her
arms
to
his
neck
with
one
of
her
rare
gestures
of
surrender
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
but
it
makes
me
happier
now
to
have
been
so
foolish
her
lips
were
parted
in
a
noiseless
laugh
and
the
tremor
of
her
lashes
made
their
shadow
move
on
her
cheek
he
looked
at
her
through
a
mist
of
pain
and
saw
all
her
offered
beauty
held
up
like
a
cup
to
his
lips
but
as
he
stooped
to
it
a
darkness
seemed
to
fall
between
them
her
arms
slipped
from
his
shoulders
and
she
drew
away
from
him
abruptly
but
she
was
with
you
then
she
exclaimed
and
then
as
he
stared
at
her
oh
don
t
say
no
only
go
and
look
at
your
eyes
he
stood
speechless
and
she
pressed
on
don
t
deny
it
oh
don
t
deny
it
what
will
be
left
for
me
to
imagine
if
you
do
don
t
you
see
how
every
single
thing
cries
it
out
owen
sees
it
he
saw
it
again
just
now
when
i
told
him
she
d
relented
and
would
see
him
he
said
is
that
darrow
s
doing
too
darrow
took
the
onslaught
in
silence
he
might
have
spoken
have
summoned
up
the
usual
phrases
of
banter
and
denial
he
was
not
even
certain
that
they
might
not
for
the
moment
have
served
their
purpose
if
he
could
have
uttered
them
without
being
seen
but
he
was
as
conscious
of
what
had
happened
to
his
face
as
if
he
had
obeyed
anna
s
bidding
and
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
knew
he
could
no
more
hide
from
her
what
was
written
there
than
he
could
efface
from
his
soul
the
fiery
record
of
what
he
had
just
lived
through
there
before
him
staring
him
in
the
eyes
and
reflecting
itself
in
all
his
lineaments
was
the
overwhelming
fact
of
sophy
viner
s
passion
and
of
the
act
by
which
she
had
attested
it
anna
was
talking
again
hurriedly
feverishly
and
his
soul
was
wrung
by
the
anguish
in
her
voice
do
speak
at
last
you
must
speak
i
don
t
want
to
ask
you
to
harm
the
girl
but
you
must
see
that
your
silence
is
doing
her
more
harm
than
your
answering
my
questions
could
you
re
leaving
me
only
the
worst
things
to
think
of
her
she
d
see
that
herself
if
she
were
here
what
worse
injury
can
you
do
her
than
to
make
me
hate
her
to
make
me
feel
she
s
plotted
with
you
to
deceive
us
oh
not
that
darrow
heard
his
own
voice
before
he
was
aware
that
he
meant
to
speak
yes
i
did
see
her
in
paris
he
went
on
after
a
pause
but
i
was
bound
to
respect
her
reason
for
not
wanting
it
anna
paled
it
was
she
at
the
theatre
that
night
i
was
with
her
at
the
theatre
one
why
should
she
have
asked
you
not
to
say
so
she
didn
t
wish
it
known
that
i
d
met
why
shouldn
t
she
have
wished
it
known
she
had
quarrelled
with
murrett
and
come
over
suddenly
to
paris
and
she
didn
t
want
the
farlows
to
hear
of
it
i
came
across
her
by
accident
and
she
asked
me
not
to
speak
of
having
seen
because
of
her
quarrel
because
she
was
ashamed
of
her
part
in
it
oh
no
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
be
ashamed
of
but
the
farlows
had
found
the
place
for
her
and
she
didn
t
want
them
to
know
how
suddenly
she
d
had
to
leave
and
how
badly
murrett
had
behaved
she
was
in
a
terrible
plight
the
woman
had
even
kept
back
her
month
s
salary
she
knew
the
farlows
would
be
awfully
upset
and
she
wanted
more
time
to
prepare
darrow
heard
himself
speak
as
though
the
words
had
proceeded
from
other
lips
his
explanation
sounded
plausible
enough
and
he
anna
s
look
grew
lighter
she
waited
a
moment
as
though
to
be
sure
he
had
no
more
to
add
then
she
said
but
the
farlows
did
know
they
told
me
all
about
it
when
they
sent
her
to
he
flushed
as
if
she
had
laid
a
deliberate
trap
for
him
they
may
know
now
they
didn
t
then
that
s
no
reason
for
her
continuing
now
to
make
a
mystery
of
having
met
it
s
the
only
reason
i
can
give
then
i
ll
go
and
ask
her
for
one
she
turned
and
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
door
anna
he
started
to
follow
her
and
then
checked
himself
don
t
do
that
why
not
it
s
not
like
you
not
generous
she
stood
before
him
straight
and
pale
but
under
her
rigid
face
he
saw
the
tumult
of
her
doubt
and
misery
i
don
t
want
to
be
ungenerous
i
don
t
want
to
pry
into
her
secrets
but
things
can
t
be
left
like
this
wouldn
t
it
be
better
for
me
to
go
to
her
surely
she
ll
understand
she
ll
explain
it
may
be
some
mere
trifle
she
s
concealing
something
that
would
horrify
the
farlows
but
that
i
shouldn
t
see
any
harm
in
she
paused
her
eyes
searching
his
face
a
love
affair
i
suppose
that
s
it
you
met
her
with
some
man
at
the
theatre
and
she
was
frightened
and
begged
you
to
fib
about
it
those
poor
young
things
that
have
to
go
about
among
us
like
machines
oh
if
you
knew
how
i
pity
them
if
you
pity
her
why
not
let
her
go
she
stared
let
her
go
go
for
good
you
mean
is
that
the
best
you
can
say
for
her
let
things
take
their
course
after
all
it
s
between
herself
and
and
you
and
me
and
effie
if
owen
marries
her
and
i
leave
my
child
with
them
don
t
you
see
the
impossibility
of
what
you
re
asking
we
re
all
bound
together
in
this
darrow
turned
away
with
a
groan
oh
let
her
go
let
her
then
there
is
something
something
really
bad
she
was
with
some
one
when
you
met
her
some
one
with
whom
she
was
she
broke
off
and
he
saw
her
struggling
with
new
thoughts
if
it
s
that
of
course
oh
don
t
you
see
she
desperately
appealed
to
him
that
i
must
find
out
and
that
it
s
too
late
now
for
you
not
to
speak
don
t
be
afraid
that
i
ll
betray
you
i
ll
never
never
let
a
soul
suspect
but
i
must
know
the
truth
and
surely
it
s
best
for
her
that
i
should
find
it
out
from
darrow
waited
a
moment
then
he
said
slowly
what
you
imagine
s
mere
madness
she
was
at
the
theatre
with
with
you
he
saw
a
tremor
pass
through
her
but
she
controlled
it
instantly
and
faced
him
straight
and
motionless
as
a
wounded
creature
in
the
moment
before
it
feels
its
wound
why
should
you
both
have
made
a
mystery
of
that
i
ve
told
you
the
idea
was
not
he
cast
about
she
may
have
been
afraid
that
owen
but
that
was
not
a
reason
for
her
asking
you
to
tell
me
that
you
hardly
knew
her
that
you
hadn
t
even
seen
her
for
she
broke
off
and
the
blood
rose
to
her
face
and
forehead
even
if
she
had
other
reasons
there
could
be
only
one
reason
for
your
obeying
her
silence
fell
between
them
a
silence
in
which
the
room
seemed
to
become
suddenly
resonant
with
voices
darrow
s
gaze
wandered
to
the
window
and
he
noticed
that
the
gale
of
two
days
before
had
nearly
stripped
the
tops
of
the
in
the
court
anna
had
moved
away
and
was
resting
her
elbows
against
the
her
head
in
her
hands
as
she
stood
there
he
took
in
with
a
new
intensity
of
vision
little
details
of
her
appearance
that
his
eyes
had
often
cherished
the
branching
blue
veins
in
the
backs
of
her
hands
the
warm
shadow
that
her
hair
cast
on
her
ear
and
the
colour
of
the
hair
itself
dull
black
with
a
tawny
like
the
wings
of
certain
birds
he
felt
it
to
be
useless
to
speak
after
a
while
she
lifted
her
head
and
said
i
shall
not
see
her
again
before
she
he
made
no
answer
and
turning
to
him
she
added
that
is
why
she
s
going
i
suppose
because
she
loves
you
and
won
t
give
you
up
darrow
waited
the
paltriness
of
conventional
denial
was
so
apparent
to
him
that
even
if
it
could
have
delayed
discovery
he
could
no
longer
have
resorted
to
it
under
all
his
other
fears
was
the
dread
of
dishonouring
the
hour
she
has
given
me
up
he
said
at
last
xxviii
when
he
had
gone
out
of
the
room
anna
stood
where
he
had
left
her
i
must
believe
him
i
must
believe
him
she
said
a
moment
before
at
the
moment
when
she
had
lifted
her
arms
to
his
neck
she
had
been
wrapped
in
a
sense
of
complete
security
all
the
spirits
of
doubt
had
been
exorcised
and
her
love
was
once
more
the
clear
habitation
in
which
every
thought
and
feeling
could
move
in
blissful
freedom
and
then
as
she
raised
her
face
to
darrow
s
and
met
his
eyes
she
had
seemed
to
look
into
the
very
ruins
of
his
soul
that
was
the
only
way
she
could
express
it
it
was
as
though
he
and
she
had
been
looking
at
two
sides
of
the
same
thing
and
the
side
she
had
seen
had
been
all
light
and
life
and
his
a
place
of
graves
she
didn
t
now
recall
who
had
spoken
first
or
even
very
clearly
what
had
been
said
it
seemed
to
her
only
a
moment
later
that
she
had
found
herself
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
room
which
had
suddenly
grown
so
small
that
even
with
its
length
between
them
she
felt
as
if
he
touched
her
crying
out
to
him
it
is
because
of
you
she
s
going
and
reading
the
avowal
in
his
face
that
was
his
secret
then
their
secret
he
had
met
the
girl
in
paris
and
helped
her
in
her
straits
lent
her
money
anna
vaguely
conjectured
and
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
and
on
meeting
him
again
had
been
suddenly
overmastered
by
her
passion
anna
dropping
back
into
her
sat
staring
these
facts
in
the
face
the
girl
had
been
in
a
desperate
plight
frightened
penniless
outraged
by
what
had
happened
and
not
knowing
with
a
woman
like
murrett
what
fresh
injury
might
impend
and
darrow
meeting
her
in
this
distracted
hour
had
pitied
counselled
been
kind
to
her
with
the
fatal
the
inevitable
result
there
were
the
facts
as
anna
made
them
out
that
at
least
was
their
external
aspect
was
as
much
of
them
as
she
had
been
suffered
to
see
and
into
the
secret
intricacies
they
might
cover
she
dared
not
yet
project
her
thoughts
i
must
believe
him
i
must
believe
him
she
kept
on
repeating
the
words
like
a
talisman
it
was
natural
after
all
that
he
should
have
behaved
as
he
had
defended
the
girl
s
piteous
secret
to
the
last
she
too
began
to
feel
the
contagion
of
his
pity
the
stir
in
her
breast
of
feelings
deeper
and
more
native
to
her
than
the
pains
of
jealousy
from
the
security
of
her
blessedness
she
longed
to
lean
over
with
compassionate
hands
but
owen
what
was
owen
s
part
to
be
she
owed
herself
first
to
him
she
was
bound
to
protect
him
not
only
from
all
knowledge
of
the
secret
she
had
surprised
but
also
and
chiefly
from
its
consequences
yes
the
girl
must
go
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
darrow
himself
had
seen
it
from
the
first
and
at
the
thought
she
had
a
wild
revulsion
of
relief
as
though
she
had
been
trying
to
create
in
her
heart
the
delusion
of
a
generosity
she
could
not
feel
the
one
fact
on
which
she
could
stay
her
mind
was
that
sophy
was
leaving
immediately
would
be
out
of
the
house
within
an
hour
once
she
was
gone
it
would
be
easier
to
bring
owen
to
the
point
of
understanding
that
the
break
was
final
if
necessary
to
work
upon
the
girl
to
make
him
see
it
but
that
anna
was
sure
would
not
be
necessary
it
was
clear
that
sophy
viner
was
leaving
givre
with
no
thought
of
ever
seeing
it
again
suddenly
as
she
tried
to
put
some
order
in
her
thoughts
she
heard
owen
s
call
at
the
door
mother
a
name
he
seldom
gave
her
there
was
a
new
note
in
his
voice
the
note
of
a
joyous
impatience
it
made
her
turn
hastily
to
the
glass
to
see
what
face
she
was
about
to
show
him
but
before
she
had
had
time
to
compose
it
he
was
in
the
room
and
she
was
caught
in
a
hug
it
s
all
right
it
s
all
right
and
it
s
all
your
doing
i
want
to
do
the
worst
kind
of
penance
bell
and
candle
and
the
rest
i
ve
been
through
it
with
her
and
now
she
hands
me
on
to
you
and
you
re
to
call
me
any
names
you
he
freed
her
with
his
happy
laugh
i
m
to
be
stood
in
the
corner
till
next
week
and
then
i
m
to
go
up
to
see
her
and
she
says
i
owe
it
all
to
you
to
me
it
was
the
first
phrase
she
found
to
clutch
at
as
she
tried
to
steady
herself
in
the
eddies
of
his
joy
yes
you
were
so
patient
and
so
dear
to
her
and
you
saw
at
once
what
a
damned
ass
i
d
been
she
tried
a
smile
and
it
seemed
to
pass
muster
with
him
for
he
sent
it
back
in
a
broad
beam
that
s
not
so
difficult
to
see
no
i
admit
it
doesn
t
take
a
microscope
but
you
were
so
wise
and
wonderful
you
always
are
i
ve
been
mad
these
last
days
simply
mad
you
and
she
might
well
have
washed
your
hands
of
me
and
instead
it
s
all
right
all
right
she
drew
back
a
little
trying
to
keep
the
smile
on
her
lips
and
not
let
him
get
the
least
glimpse
of
what
it
hid
now
if
ever
indeed
it
behoved
her
to
be
wise
and
wonderful
i
m
so
glad
dear
so
glad
if
only
you
ll
always
feel
like
that
about
me
she
stopped
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
and
aghast
at
the
idea
that
her
own
hands
should
have
retied
the
knot
she
imagined
to
be
broken
but
she
saw
he
had
something
more
to
say
something
hard
to
get
out
but
absolutely
necessary
to
express
he
caught
her
hands
pulled
her
close
and
with
his
forehead
drawn
into
its
whimsical
smiling
wrinkles
look
here
he
cried
if
darrow
wants
to
call
me
a
damned
ass
too
you
re
not
to
stop
him
it
brought
her
back
to
a
sharper
sense
of
her
central
peril
of
the
secret
to
be
kept
from
him
at
whatever
cost
to
her
racked
nerves
oh
you
know
he
doesn
t
always
wait
for
orders
on
the
whole
it
sounded
better
than
she
d
feared
you
mean
he
s
called
me
one
already
he
accepted
the
fact
with
his
gayest
laugh
well
that
saves
a
lot
of
trouble
now
we
can
pass
to
the
order
of
the
day
he
broke
off
and
glanced
at
the
clock
which
is
you
know
dear
that
she
s
starting
in
about
an
hour
she
and
adelaide
must
already
be
snatching
a
hasty
sandwich
you
ll
come
down
to
bid
them
yes
of
there
had
in
fact
grown
upon
her
while
he
spoke
the
urgency
of
seeing
sophy
viner
again
before
she
left
the
thought
was
deeply
distasteful
anna
shrank
from
encountering
the
girl
till
she
had
cleared
a
way
through
her
own
perplexities
but
it
was
obvious
that
since
they
had
separated
barely
an
hour
earlier
the
situation
had
taken
a
new
shape
sophy
viner
had
apparently
reconsidered
her
decision
to
break
amicably
but
definitely
with
owen
and
stood
again
in
their
path
a
menace
and
a
mystery
and
confused
impulses
of
resistance
stirred
in
anna
s
mind
she
felt
owen
s
touch
on
her
arm
are
you
coming
yes
yes
what
s
the
matter
you
look
so
what
do
you
mean
by
strange
i
don
t
know
startled
she
read
what
her
look
must
be
by
its
sudden
reflection
in
his
face
do
i
no
wonder
you
ve
given
us
all
an
exciting
he
held
to
his
point
you
re
more
excited
now
that
there
s
no
cause
for
it
what
on
earth
has
happened
since
i
saw
you
he
looked
about
the
room
as
if
seeking
the
clue
to
her
agitation
and
in
her
dread
of
what
he
might
guess
she
answered
what
has
happened
is
simply
that
i
m
rather
tired
will
you
ask
sophy
to
come
up
and
see
me
here
while
she
waited
she
tried
to
think
what
she
should
say
when
the
girl
appeared
but
she
had
never
been
more
conscious
of
her
inability
to
deal
with
the
oblique
and
the
tortuous
she
had
lacked
the
hard
teachings
of
experience
and
an
instinctive
disdain
for
whatever
was
less
clear
and
open
than
her
own
conscience
had
kept
her
from
learning
anything
of
the
intricacies
and
contradictions
of
other
hearts
she
said
to
herself
i
must
find
out
yet
everything
in
her
recoiled
from
the
means
by
which
she
felt
it
must
be
done
sophy
viner
appeared
almost
immediately
dressed
for
departure
her
little
bag
on
her
arm
she
was
still
pale
to
the
point
of
haggardness
but
with
a
light
upon
her
that
struck
anna
with
surprise
or
was
it
perhaps
that
she
was
looking
at
the
girl
with
new
eyes
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
not
as
effie
s
governess
not
as
owen
s
bride
but
as
the
embodiment
of
that
unknown
peril
lurking
in
the
background
of
every
woman
s
thoughts
about
her
lover
anna
at
any
rate
with
a
sudden
sense
of
estrangement
noted
in
her
graces
and
snares
never
before
perceived
it
was
only
the
flash
of
a
primitive
instinct
but
it
lasted
long
enough
to
make
her
ashamed
of
the
darknesses
it
lit
up
in
her
heart
she
signed
to
sophy
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
beside
her
i
asked
you
to
come
up
to
me
because
i
wanted
to
say
quietly
she
explained
feeling
her
lips
tremble
but
trying
to
speak
in
a
tone
of
friendly
naturalness
the
girl
s
only
answer
was
a
faint
smile
of
acquiescence
and
anna
disconcerted
by
her
silence
went
on
you
ve
decided
then
not
to
break
your
engagement
sophy
viner
raised
her
head
with
a
look
of
surprise
evidently
the
question
thus
abruptly
put
must
have
sounded
strangely
on
the
lips
of
so
ardent
a
partisan
as
leath
i
thought
that
was
what
you
wished
she
said
what
i
wished
anna
s
heart
shook
against
her
side
i
wish
of
course
whatever
seems
best
for
owen
it
s
natural
you
must
understand
that
that
consideration
should
come
first
with
me
sophy
was
looking
at
her
steadily
i
supposed
it
was
the
only
one
that
counted
with
the
curtness
of
retort
roused
anna
s
latent
antagonism
it
is
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
that
startled
her
as
she
heard
it
had
she
ever
spoken
so
to
any
one
before
she
felt
frightened
as
though
her
very
nature
had
changed
without
her
knowing
it
feeling
the
girl
s
astonished
gaze
still
on
her
she
continued
the
suddenness
of
the
change
has
naturally
surprised
me
when
i
left
you
it
was
understood
that
you
were
to
reserve
your
decision
and
now
anna
waited
for
a
reply
that
did
not
come
she
did
not
understand
the
girl
s
attitude
the
edge
of
irony
in
her
short
syllables
the
plainly
premeditated
determination
to
lay
the
burden
of
proof
on
her
interlocutor
anna
felt
the
sudden
need
to
lift
their
intercourse
above
this
mean
level
of
defiance
and
distrust
she
looked
appealingly
at
sophy
isn
t
it
best
that
we
should
speak
quite
frankly
it
s
this
change
on
your
part
that
perplexes
me
you
can
hardly
be
surprised
at
that
it
s
true
i
asked
you
not
to
break
with
owen
too
abruptly
and
i
asked
it
believe
me
as
much
for
your
sake
as
for
his
i
wanted
you
to
take
time
to
think
over
the
difficulty
that
seems
to
have
arisen
between
you
the
fact
that
you
felt
it
required
thinking
over
seemed
to
show
you
wouldn
t
take
the
final
step
lightly
wouldn
t
i
mean
accept
of
owen
more
than
you
could
give
him
but
your
change
of
mind
obliges
me
to
ask
the
question
i
thought
you
would
have
asked
yourself
is
there
any
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
marry
owen
she
stopped
a
little
breathlessly
her
eyes
on
sophy
viner
s
burning
face
any
reason
what
do
you
mean
by
a
reason
anna
continued
to
look
at
her
gravely
do
you
love
some
one
else
she
asked
sophy
s
first
look
was
one
of
wonder
and
a
faint
relief
then
she
gave
back
the
other
s
scrutiny
in
a
glance
of
indescribable
reproach
ah
you
might
have
waited
she
exclaimed
waited
till
i
d
gone
till
i
was
out
of
the
house
you
might
have
known
you
might
have
guessed
she
turned
her
eyes
again
on
anna
i
only
meant
to
let
him
hope
a
little
longer
so
that
he
shouldn
t
suspect
anything
of
course
i
can
t
marry
him
she
said
anna
stood
motionless
silenced
by
the
shock
of
the
avowal
she
too
was
trembling
less
with
anger
than
with
a
confused
compassion
but
the
feeling
was
so
blent
with
others
less
generous
and
more
obscure
that
she
found
no
words
to
express
it
and
the
two
women
faced
each
other
without
speaking
i
d
better
go
sophy
murmured
at
length
with
lowered
head
the
words
roused
in
anna
a
latent
impulse
of
compunction
the
girl
looked
so
young
so
exposed
and
desolate
and
what
thoughts
must
she
be
hiding
in
her
heart
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
part
in
such
a
spirit
i
want
you
to
know
that
no
one
said
anything
it
was
i
who
sophy
looked
at
her
you
mean
that
darrow
didn
t
tell
you
of
course
not
do
you
suppose
i
thought
he
did
you
found
it
out
that
s
all
i
knew
you
would
in
your
place
i
should
have
guessed
it
the
words
were
spoken
simply
without
irony
or
emphasis
but
they
went
through
anna
like
a
sword
yes
the
girl
would
have
had
divinations
promptings
that
she
had
not
had
she
felt
half
envious
of
such
a
sad
precocity
of
wisdom
i
m
so
sorry
so
sorry
she
murmured
things
happen
that
way
now
i
d
better
go
i
d
like
to
say
to
oh
it
broke
in
a
cry
from
effie
s
mother
not
like
this
you
mustn
t
i
feel
you
make
me
feel
too
horribly
as
if
i
were
driving
you
away
the
words
had
rushed
up
from
the
depths
of
her
bewildered
pity
no
one
is
driving
me
away
i
had
to
go
she
heard
the
girl
reply
there
was
another
silence
during
which
passionate
impulses
of
magnanimity
warred
in
anna
with
her
doubts
and
dreads
at
length
her
eyes
on
sophy
s
face
yes
you
must
go
now
she
began
but
later
on
after
a
while
when
all
this
is
over
if
there
s
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
marry
owen
she
paused
a
moment
on
the
words
i
shouldn
t
want
you
to
think
i
stood
between
you
you
sophy
flushed
again
and
then
grew
pale
she
seemed
to
try
to
speak
but
no
words
came
yes
it
was
not
true
when
i
said
just
now
that
i
was
thinking
only
of
owen
i
m
sorry
oh
so
sorry
for
you
too
your
life
i
know
how
hard
it
s
been
and
mine
mine
s
so
full
happy
women
understand
best
anna
drew
near
and
touched
the
girl
s
hand
then
she
began
again
pouring
all
her
soul
into
the
broken
phrases
it
s
terrible
now
you
see
no
future
but
if
by
and
bye
you
know
best
but
you
re
so
young
and
at
your
age
things
do
pass
if
there
s
no
reason
no
real
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
marry
owen
i
want
him
to
hope
i
ll
help
him
to
hope
if
you
say
so
with
the
urgency
of
her
pleading
her
clasp
tightened
on
sophy
s
hand
but
it
warmed
to
no
responsive
tremor
the
girl
seemed
numb
and
anna
was
frightened
by
the
stony
silence
of
her
look
i
suppose
i
m
not
more
than
half
a
woman
she
mused
for
i
don
t
want
my
happiness
to
hurt
her
and
aloud
she
repeated
if
only
you
ll
tell
me
there
s
no
reason
the
girl
did
not
speak
but
suddenly
like
a
snapped
branch
she
bent
stooped
down
to
the
hand
that
clasped
her
and
laid
her
lips
upon
it
in
a
stream
of
weeping
she
cried
silently
continuously
abundantly
as
though
anna
s
touch
had
released
the
waters
of
some
deep
spring
of
pain
then
as
anna
moved
and
half
afraid
leaned
over
her
with
a
sound
of
pity
she
stood
up
and
turned
away
you
re
going
then
for
good
like
this
anna
moved
toward
her
and
stopped
sophy
stopped
too
with
eyes
that
shrank
from
her
oh
anna
cried
and
hid
her
face
the
girl
walked
across
the
room
and
paused
again
in
the
doorway
from
there
she
flung
back
i
wanted
it
i
chose
it
he
was
good
to
me
no
one
ever
was
so
good
the
turned
and
anna
heard
her
go
xxix
her
first
thought
was
he
s
going
too
in
a
few
hours
i
needn
t
see
him
again
before
he
leaves
at
that
moment
the
possibility
of
having
to
look
in
darrow
s
face
and
hear
him
speak
seemed
to
her
more
unendurable
than
anything
else
she
could
imagine
then
on
the
next
wave
of
feeling
came
the
desire
to
confront
him
at
once
and
wring
from
him
she
knew
not
what
avowal
denial
justification
anything
that
should
open
some
channel
of
escape
to
the
flood
of
her
anguish
she
had
told
owen
she
was
tired
and
this
seemed
a
sufficient
reason
for
remaining
upstairs
when
the
motor
came
to
the
door
and
miss
painter
and
sophy
viner
were
borne
off
in
it
sufficient
also
for
sending
word
to
madame
de
chantelle
that
she
would
not
come
down
till
after
luncheon
having
despatched
her
maid
with
this
message
she
lay
down
on
her
sofa
and
stared
before
her
into
darkness
she
had
been
unhappy
before
and
the
vision
of
old
miseries
flocked
like
hungry
ghosts
about
her
fresh
pain
she
recalled
her
youthful
disappointment
the
failure
of
her
marriage
the
wasted
years
that
followed
but
those
were
negative
sorrows
denials
and
postponements
of
life
she
seemed
in
no
way
related
to
their
shadowy
victim
she
who
was
stretched
on
this
fiery
rack
of
the
irreparable
she
had
suffered
before
yes
but
lucidly
reflectively
elegiacally
now
she
was
suffering
as
a
hurt
animal
must
blindly
furiously
with
the
single
fierce
animal
longing
that
the
awful
pain
should
stop
she
heard
her
maid
knock
and
she
hid
her
face
and
made
no
answer
the
knocking
continued
and
the
discipline
of
habit
at
length
made
her
lift
her
head
compose
her
face
and
hold
out
her
hand
to
the
note
the
woman
brought
her
it
was
a
word
from
darrow
may
i
see
you
and
she
said
at
once
in
a
voice
that
sounded
thin
and
empty
ask
darrow
to
come
the
maid
enquired
if
she
wished
to
have
her
hair
smoothed
first
and
she
answered
that
it
didn
t
matter
but
when
the
door
had
closed
the
instinct
of
pride
drew
her
to
her
feet
and
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
above
the
mantelpiece
and
passed
her
hands
over
her
hair
her
eyes
were
burning
and
her
face
looked
tired
and
thinner
otherwise
she
could
see
no
change
in
her
appearance
and
she
wondered
that
at
such
a
moment
her
body
should
seem
as
unrelated
to
the
self
that
writhed
within
her
as
if
it
had
been
a
statue
or
a
picture
the
maid
reopened
the
door
to
show
in
darrow
and
he
paused
a
moment
on
the
threshold
as
if
waiting
for
anna
to
speak
he
was
extremely
pale
but
he
looked
neither
ashamed
nor
uncertain
and
she
said
to
herself
with
a
perverse
thrill
of
appreciation
he
s
as
proud
as
i
aloud
she
asked
you
wanted
to
see
me
naturally
he
replied
in
a
grave
voice
don
t
it
s
useless
i
know
everything
nothing
you
can
say
will
at
the
direct
affirmation
he
turned
even
paler
and
his
eyes
which
he
kept
resolutely
fixed
on
her
confessed
his
misery
you
allow
me
no
voice
in
deciding
that
deciding
what
that
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
said
he
waited
for
her
to
answer
and
then
went
on
i
don
t
even
know
what
you
mean
by
everything
oh
i
don
t
know
what
more
there
is
i
know
enough
i
implored
her
to
deny
it
and
she
couldn
t
what
can
you
and
i
have
to
say
to
each
other
her
voice
broke
into
a
sob
the
animal
anguish
was
upon
her
again
just
a
blind
cry
against
her
pain
darrow
kept
his
head
high
and
his
eyes
steady
it
must
be
as
you
wish
and
yet
it
s
not
like
you
to
be
afraid
to
talk
things
out
to
face
it
s
for
you
to
face
this
not
me
all
i
ask
is
to
face
it
but
with
once
more
he
paused
won
t
you
tell
me
what
miss
viner
told
you
oh
she
s
generous
to
the
utmost
the
pain
caught
her
like
a
physical
throe
it
suddenly
came
to
her
how
the
girl
must
have
loved
him
to
be
so
generous
what
memories
there
must
be
between
them
oh
go
please
go
it
s
too
horrible
why
should
i
have
to
see
you
she
stammered
lifting
her
hands
to
her
eyes
with
her
face
hidden
she
waited
to
hear
him
move
away
to
hear
the
door
open
and
close
again
as
a
few
hours
earlier
it
had
opened
and
closed
on
sophy
viner
but
darrow
made
no
sound
or
movement
he
too
was
waiting
anna
felt
a
thrill
of
resentment
his
presence
was
an
outrage
on
her
sorrow
a
humiliation
to
her
pride
it
was
strange
that
he
should
wait
for
her
to
tell
him
so
you
want
me
to
leave
givre
he
asked
at
length
she
made
no
answer
and
he
went
on
of
course
i
ll
do
as
you
wish
but
if
i
go
now
am
i
not
to
see
you
again
his
voice
was
firm
his
pride
was
answering
her
pride
she
faltered
you
must
see
it
s
useless
i
might
remind
you
that
you
re
dismissing
me
without
a
hearing
without
a
hearing
i
ve
heard
you
both
but
i
won
t
he
continued
remind
you
of
that
or
of
anything
or
any
one
but
owen
yes
if
we
could
somehow
spare
him
she
had
dropped
her
hands
and
turned
her
startled
eyes
on
him
it
seemed
to
her
an
age
since
she
had
thought
of
owen
you
see
don
t
you
darrow
continued
that
if
you
send
me
away
now
she
interrupted
yes
i
see
and
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
at
length
she
said
very
low
i
don
t
want
any
one
else
to
suffer
as
i
m
suffering
owen
knows
i
meant
to
leave
tomorrow
darrow
went
on
any
sudden
change
of
plan
may
make
him
think
oh
she
saw
his
inevitable
logic
the
horror
of
it
was
on
every
side
of
her
it
had
seemed
possible
to
control
her
grief
and
face
darrow
calmly
while
she
was
upheld
by
the
belief
that
this
was
their
last
hour
together
that
after
he
had
passed
out
of
the
room
there
would
be
no
fear
of
seeing
him
again
no
fear
that
his
nearness
his
look
his
voice
and
all
the
unseen
influences
that
flowed
from
him
would
dissolve
her
soul
to
weakness
but
her
courage
failed
at
the
idea
of
having
to
conspire
with
him
to
shield
owen
of
keeping
up
with
him
for
owen
s
sake
a
feint
of
union
and
felicity
to
live
at
darrow
s
side
in
seeming
intimacy
and
harmony
for
another
hours
seemed
harder
than
to
live
without
him
for
all
the
rest
of
her
days
her
strength
failed
her
and
she
threw
herself
down
and
buried
her
sobs
in
the
cushions
where
she
had
so
often
hidden
a
face
aglow
with
happiness
anna
his
voice
was
close
to
her
let
me
talk
to
you
quietly
it
s
not
worthy
of
either
of
us
to
be
words
of
endearment
would
have
offended
her
but
her
heart
rose
at
the
call
to
her
courage
i
ve
no
defense
to
make
he
went
on
the
facts
are
miserable
enough
but
at
least
i
want
you
to
see
them
as
they
are
above
all
i
want
you
to
know
the
truth
about
miss
viner
the
name
sent
the
blood
to
anna
s
forehead
she
raised
her
head
and
faced
him
why
should
i
know
more
of
her
than
what
she
s
told
me
i
never
wish
to
hear
her
name
again
it
s
because
you
feel
about
her
in
that
way
that
i
ask
you
in
the
name
of
common
charity
to
let
me
give
you
the
facts
as
they
are
and
not
as
you
ve
probably
imagined
i
ve
told
you
i
don
t
think
uncharitably
of
her
i
don
t
want
to
think
of
her
at
all
that
s
why
i
tell
you
you
re
afraid
yes
you
ve
always
said
you
wanted
above
all
to
look
at
life
at
the
human
problem
as
it
is
without
fear
and
without
hypocrisy
and
it
s
not
always
a
pleasant
thing
to
look
he
broke
off
and
then
began
again
don
t
think
this
a
plea
for
myself
i
don
t
want
to
say
a
word
to
lessen
my
offense
i
don
t
want
to
talk
of
myself
at
all
even
if
i
did
i
probably
couldn
t
make
you
understand
i
don
t
myself
as
i
look
back
be
just
to
me
it
s
your
right
all
i
ask
you
is
to
be
generous
to
miss
viner
she
stood
up
trembling
you
re
free
to
be
as
generous
to
her
as
you
please
yes
you
ve
made
it
clear
to
me
that
i
m
free
but
there
s
nothing
i
can
do
for
her
that
will
help
her
half
as
much
as
your
understanding
her
nothing
you
can
do
for
her
you
can
marry
her
his
face
hardened
you
certainly
couldn
t
wish
her
a
worse
fate
it
must
have
been
what
she
expected
relied
on
he
was
silent
and
she
broke
out
or
what
is
she
what
are
you
it
s
too
horrible
on
your
way
here
to
me
she
felt
the
tears
in
her
throat
and
stopped
that
was
it
he
said
bluntly
she
stared
at
him
i
was
on
my
way
to
you
after
repeated
delays
and
postponements
of
your
own
making
at
the
very
last
you
turned
me
back
with
a
mere
word
and
without
explanation
i
waited
for
a
letter
and
none
came
i
m
not
saying
this
to
justify
myself
i
m
simply
trying
to
make
you
understand
i
felt
hurt
and
bitter
and
bewildered
i
thought
you
meant
to
give
me
up
and
suddenly
in
my
way
i
found
some
one
to
be
sorry
for
to
be
of
use
to
that
i
swear
to
you
was
the
way
it
began
the
rest
was
a
moment
s
folly
a
flash
of
madness
as
such
things
are
we
ve
never
seen
each
other
since
anna
was
looking
at
him
coldly
you
sufficiently
describe
her
in
saying
that
yes
if
you
measure
her
by
conventional
standards
which
is
what
you
always
declare
you
never
conventional
standards
a
girl
who
she
was
checked
by
a
sudden
rush
of
almost
physical
repugnance
suddenly
she
broke
out
i
always
thought
her
an
adventuress
always
i
don
t
mean
always
but
after
you
came
she
s
not
an
you
mean
that
she
professes
to
act
on
the
new
theories
the
stuff
that
awful
women
rave
about
on
platforms
oh
i
don
t
think
she
pretended
to
have
a
theory
she
hadn
t
even
that
excuse
she
had
the
excuse
of
her
loneliness
her
unhappiness
of
miseries
and
humiliations
that
a
woman
like
you
can
t
even
guess
she
had
nothing
to
look
back
to
but
indifference
or
unkindness
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
anxiety
she
saw
i
was
sorry
for
her
and
it
touched
her
she
made
too
much
of
it
she
exaggerated
it
i
ought
to
have
seen
the
danger
but
i
didn
t
there
s
no
possible
excuse
for
what
i
anna
listened
to
him
in
speechless
misery
every
word
he
spoke
threw
back
a
disintegrating
light
on
their
own
past
he
had
come
to
her
with
an
open
face
and
a
clear
conscience
come
to
her
from
this
if
his
security
was
the
security
of
falsehood
it
was
horrible
if
it
meant
that
he
had
forgotten
it
was
worse
she
would
have
liked
to
stop
her
ears
to
close
her
eyes
to
shut
out
every
sight
and
sound
and
suggestion
of
a
world
in
which
such
things
could
be
and
at
the
same
time
she
was
tormented
by
the
desire
to
know
more
to
understand
better
to
feel
herself
less
ignorant
and
inexpert
in
matters
which
made
so
much
of
the
stuff
of
human
experience
what
did
he
mean
by
a
moment
s
folly
a
flash
of
madness
how
did
people
enter
on
such
adventures
how
pass
out
of
them
without
more
visible
traces
of
their
havoc
her
imagination
recoiled
from
the
vision
of
a
sudden
debasing
familiarity
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
thoughts
would
never
again
be
pure
i
swear
to
you
she
heard
darrow
saying
it
was
simply
that
and
nothing
she
wondered
at
his
composure
his
competence
at
his
knowing
so
exactly
what
to
say
no
doubt
men
often
had
to
make
such
explanations
they
had
the
formulas
by
heart
a
leaden
lassitude
descended
on
her
she
passed
from
flame
and
torment
into
a
colourless
cold
world
where
everything
surrounding
her
seemed
equally
indifferent
and
remote
for
a
moment
she
simply
ceased
to
feel
she
became
aware
that
darrow
was
waiting
for
her
to
speak
and
she
made
an
effort
to
represent
to
herself
the
meaning
of
what
he
had
just
said
but
her
mind
was
as
blank
as
a
blurred
mirror
finally
she
brought
out
i
don
t
think
i
understand
what
you
ve
told
no
you
don
t
understand
he
returned
with
sudden
bitterness
and
on
his
lips
the
charge
of
incomprehension
seemed
an
offense
to
her
i
don
t
want
to
about
such
things
he
answered
almost
harshly
don
t
be
afraid
you
never
will
and
for
an
instant
they
faced
each
other
like
enemies
then
the
tears
swelled
in
her
throat
at
his
reproach
you
mean
i
don
t
feel
things
i
m
too
hard
no
you
re
too
high
too
fine
such
things
are
too
far
from
he
paused
as
if
conscious
of
the
futility
of
going
on
with
whatever
he
had
meant
to
say
and
again
for
a
short
space
they
confronted
each
other
no
longer
as
enemies
so
it
seemed
to
her
but
as
beings
of
different
language
who
had
forgotten
the
few
words
they
had
learned
of
each
other
s
speech
darrow
broke
the
silence
it
s
best
on
all
accounts
that
i
should
stay
till
tomorrow
but
i
needn
t
intrude
on
you
we
needn
t
meet
again
alone
i
only
want
to
be
sure
i
know
your
he
spoke
the
short
sentences
in
a
level
voice
as
though
he
were
summing
up
the
results
of
a
business
conference
anna
looked
at
him
vaguely
my
wishes
as
to
owen
at
that
she
started
they
must
never
meet
again
it
s
not
likely
they
will
what
i
meant
was
that
it
depends
on
you
to
spare
him
she
answered
steadily
he
shall
never
know
and
after
another
interval
darrow
said
this
is
at
the
word
she
seemed
to
understand
for
the
first
time
whither
the
flying
moments
had
been
leading
them
resentment
and
indignation
died
down
and
all
her
consciousness
resolved
itself
into
the
mere
visual
sense
that
he
was
there
before
her
near
enough
for
her
to
lift
her
hand
and
touch
him
and
that
in
another
instant
the
place
where
he
stood
would
be
empty
she
felt
a
mortal
weakness
a
craven
impulse
to
cry
out
to
him
to
stay
a
longing
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
and
take
refuge
there
from
the
unendurable
anguish
he
had
caused
her
then
the
vision
called
up
another
thought
i
shall
never
know
what
that
girl
has
known
and
the
recoil
of
pride
flung
her
back
on
the
sharp
edges
of
her
anguish
she
said
in
dread
lest
he
should
read
her
face
and
she
stood
motionless
her
head
high
while
he
walked
to
the
door
and
went
out

three
days
later
sat
in
miss
painter
s
in
the
rue
de
matignon
coming
up
precipitately
that
morning
from
the
country
she
had
reached
paris
at
one
o
clock
and
miss
painter
s
landing
some
ten
minutes
later
miss
painter
s
mouldy
little
dissembling
a
napkin
under
his
arm
had
mildly
attempted
to
oppose
her
entrance
but
anna
insisting
had
gone
straight
to
the
and
surprised
her
friend
who
ate
as
furtively
as
certain
animals
over
a
strange
meal
of
cold
mutton
and
lemonade
ignoring
the
embarrassment
she
caused
she
had
set
forth
the
object
of
her
journey
and
miss
painter
always
hatted
and
booted
for
action
had
immediately
hastened
out
leaving
her
to
the
solitude
of
the
bare
fireless
with
its
eternal
and
bowed
shutters
in
this
inhospitable
obscurity
anna
had
sat
alone
for
close
upon
two
hours
both
obscurity
and
solitude
were
acceptable
to
her
and
impatient
as
she
was
to
hear
the
result
of
the
errand
on
which
she
had
despatched
her
hostess
she
desired
still
more
to
be
alone
during
her
long
meditation
in
a
chair
before
the
muffled
hearth
she
had
been
able
for
the
first
time
to
clear
a
way
through
the
darkness
and
confusion
of
her
thoughts
the
way
did
not
go
far
and
her
attempt
to
trace
it
was
as
weak
and
spasmodic
as
a
convalescent
s
first
efforts
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
living
she
seemed
to
herself
like
some
one
struggling
to
rise
from
a
long
sickness
of
which
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
die
at
givre
she
had
fallen
into
a
kind
of
torpor
a
deadness
of
soul
traversed
by
wild
flashes
of
pain
but
whether
she
suffered
or
whether
she
was
numb
she
seemed
equally
remote
from
her
real
living
and
doing
self
it
was
only
the
discovery
that
very
morning
of
owen
s
unannounced
departure
for
paris
that
had
caught
her
out
of
her
dream
and
forced
her
back
to
action
the
dread
of
what
this
flight
might
imply
and
of
the
consequences
that
might
result
from
it
had
roused
her
to
the
sense
of
her
responsibility
and
from
the
moment
when
she
had
resolved
to
follow
her
and
had
made
her
rapid
preparations
for
pursuit
her
mind
had
begun
to
work
again
feverishly
fitfully
but
still
with
something
of
its
normal
order
in
the
train
she
had
been
too
agitated
too
preoccupied
with
what
might
next
await
her
to
give
her
thoughts
to
anything
but
the
turning
over
of
dread
alternatives
but
miss
painter
s
imperviousness
had
steadied
her
and
while
she
waited
for
the
sound
of
the
she
resolutely
returned
upon
herself
with
respect
to
her
outward
course
she
could
at
least
tell
herself
that
she
had
held
to
her
purpose
she
had
as
people
said
kept
up
during
the
hours
preceding
george
darrow
s
departure
had
gone
with
a
calm
face
about
her
usual
business
and
even
contrived
not
too
obviously
to
avoid
him
then
the
next
day
before
dawn
from
behind
the
closed
shutters
where
she
had
kept
for
half
the
night
her
vigil
she
had
heard
him
drive
off
to
the
train
which
brought
its
passengers
to
paris
in
time
for
the
calais
express
the
fact
of
his
taking
that
train
of
his
travelling
so
straight
and
far
away
from
her
gave
to
what
had
happened
the
implacable
outline
of
reality
he
was
gone
he
would
not
come
back
and
her
life
had
ended
just
as
she
had
dreamed
it
was
beginning
she
had
no
doubt
at
first
as
to
the
absolute
inevitability
of
this
conclusion
the
man
who
had
driven
away
from
her
house
in
the
autumn
dawn
was
not
the
man
she
had
loved
he
was
a
stranger
with
whom
she
had
not
a
single
thought
in
common
it
was
terrible
indeed
that
he
wore
the
face
and
spoke
in
the
voice
of
her
friend
and
that
as
long
as
he
was
under
one
roof
with
her
the
mere
way
in
which
he
moved
and
looked
could
bridge
at
a
stroke
the
gulf
between
them
that
no
doubt
was
the
fault
of
her
exaggerated
sensibility
to
outward
things
she
was
frightened
to
see
how
it
enslaved
her
a
day
or
two
before
she
had
supposed
the
sense
of
honour
was
her
deepest
sentiment
if
she
had
smiled
at
the
conventions
of
others
it
was
because
they
were
too
trivial
not
because
they
were
too
grave
there
were
certain
dishonours
with
which
she
had
never
dreamed
that
any
pact
could
be
made
she
had
had
an
incorruptible
passion
for
good
faith
and
fairness
she
had
supposed
that
once
darrow
was
gone
once
she
was
safe
from
the
danger
of
seeing
and
hearing
him
this
high
devotion
would
sustain
her
she
had
believed
it
would
be
possible
to
separate
the
image
of
the
man
she
had
thought
him
from
that
of
the
man
he
was
she
had
even
foreseen
the
hour
when
she
might
raise
a
mournful
shrine
to
the
memory
of
the
darrow
she
had
loved
without
fear
that
his
double
s
shadow
would
desecrate
it
but
now
she
had
begun
to
understand
that
the
two
men
were
really
one
the
darrow
she
worshipped
was
inseparable
from
the
darrow
she
abhorred
and
the
inevitable
conclusion
was
that
both
must
go
and
she
be
left
in
the
desert
of
a
sorrow
without
memories
but
if
the
future
was
thus
void
the
present
was
all
too
full
never
had
blow
more
complex
repercussions
and
to
remember
owen
was
to
cease
to
think
of
herself
what
impulse
what
apprehension
had
sent
him
suddenly
to
paris
and
why
had
he
thought
it
needful
to
conceal
his
going
from
her
when
sophy
viner
had
left
it
had
been
with
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
await
her
summons
and
it
seemed
improbable
that
he
would
break
his
pledge
and
seek
her
without
leave
unless
his
lover
s
intuition
had
warned
him
of
some
fresh
danger
anna
recalled
how
quickly
he
had
read
the
alarm
in
her
face
when
he
had
rushed
back
to
her
with
the
news
that
miss
viner
had
promised
to
see
him
again
in
paris
to
be
so
promptly
roused
his
suspicions
must
have
been
but
and
since
then
no
doubt
if
she
and
darrow
had
dissembled
so
had
he
to
her
proud
directness
it
was
degrading
to
think
that
they
had
been
living
together
like
enemies
who
spy
upon
each
other
s
movements
she
felt
a
desperate
longing
for
the
days
which
had
seemed
so
dull
and
narrow
but
in
which
she
had
walked
with
her
head
high
and
her
eyes
unguarded
she
had
come
up
to
paris
hardly
knowing
what
peril
she
feared
and
still
less
how
she
could
avert
it
if
owen
meant
to
see
miss
viner
and
what
other
object
could
he
have
they
must
already
be
together
and
it
was
too
late
to
interfere
it
had
indeed
occurred
to
anna
that
paris
might
not
be
his
objective
point
that
his
real
purpose
in
leaving
givre
without
her
knowledge
had
been
to
follow
darrow
to
london
and
exact
the
truth
of
him
but
even
to
her
alarmed
imagination
this
seemed
improbable
she
and
darrow
to
the
last
had
kept
up
so
complete
a
feint
of
harmony
that
whatever
owen
had
surmised
he
could
scarcely
have
risked
acting
on
his
suspicions
if
he
still
felt
the
need
of
an
explanation
it
was
almost
certainly
of
sophy
viner
that
he
would
ask
it
and
it
was
in
quest
of
sophy
viner
that
anna
had
despatched
miss
painter
she
had
found
a
blessed
refuge
from
her
perplexities
in
the
stolid
adelaide
s
unawareness
one
could
so
absolutely
count
on
miss
painter
s
guessing
no
more
than
one
chose
and
yet
acting
astutely
on
such
hints
as
one
vouchsafed
her
she
was
like
a
retriever
whose
interest
in
his
prey
ceases
when
he
lays
it
at
his
master
s
feet
anna
on
arriving
had
explained
that
owen
s
unannounced
flight
had
made
her
fear
some
fresh
misunderstanding
between
himself
and
miss
viner
in
the
interests
of
peace
she
had
thought
it
best
to
follow
him
but
she
hastily
added
that
she
did
not
wish
to
see
sophy
but
only
if
possible
to
learn
from
her
where
owen
was
with
these
brief
instructions
miss
painter
had
started
out
but
she
was
a
woman
of
many
occupations
and
had
given
her
visitor
to
understand
that
before
returning
she
should
have
to
call
on
a
friend
who
had
just
arrived
from
boston
and
afterward
despatch
to
another
exiled
compatriot
a
supply
of
cranberries
and
brandied
peaches
from
the
american
grocery
in
the
champs
elysees
gradually
as
the
moments
passed
anna
began
to
feel
the
reaction
which
in
moments
of
extreme
nervous
tension
follows
on
any
effort
of
the
will
she
seemed
to
have
gone
as
far
as
her
courage
would
carry
her
and
she
shrank
more
and
more
from
the
thought
of
miss
painter
s
return
since
whatever
information
the
latter
brought
would
necessitate
some
fresh
decision
what
should
she
say
to
owen
if
she
found
him
what
could
she
say
that
should
not
betray
the
one
thing
she
would
give
her
life
to
hide
from
him
give
her
life
how
the
phrase
derided
her
it
was
a
gift
she
would
not
have
bestowed
on
her
worst
enemy
she
would
not
have
had
sophy
viner
live
the
hours
she
was
living
now
she
tried
again
to
look
steadily
and
calmly
at
the
picture
that
the
image
of
the
girl
evoked
she
had
an
idea
that
she
ought
to
accustom
herself
to
its
contemplation
if
life
was
like
that
why
the
sooner
one
got
used
to
it
the
better
but
no
life
was
not
like
that
her
adventure
was
a
hideous
accident
she
dreaded
above
all
the
temptation
to
generalise
from
her
own
case
to
doubt
the
high
things
she
had
lived
by
and
seek
a
cheap
solace
in
belittling
what
fate
had
refused
her
there
was
such
love
as
she
had
dreamed
and
she
meant
to
go
on
believing
in
it
and
cherishing
the
thought
that
she
was
worthy
of
it
what
had
happened
to
her
was
grotesque
and
mean
and
miserable
but
she
herself
was
none
of
these
things
and
never
never
would
she
make
of
herself
the
mock
that
fate
had
made
of
her
she
could
not
as
yet
bear
to
think
deliberately
of
darrow
but
she
kept
on
repeating
to
herself
by
and
bye
that
will
come
even
now
she
was
determined
not
to
let
his
image
be
distorted
by
her
suffering
as
soon
as
she
could
she
would
try
to
single
out
for
remembrance
the
individual
things
she
had
liked
in
him
before
she
had
loved
him
altogether
no
spiritual
exercise
devised
by
the
discipline
of
piety
could
have
been
more
torturing
but
its
very
cruelty
attracted
her
she
wanted
to
wear
herself
out
with
new
pains
xxxi
the
sound
of
miss
painter
s
made
her
start
she
was
still
a
bundle
of
quivering
fears
to
whom
each
coming
moment
seemed
a
menace
there
was
a
slight
interval
and
a
sound
of
voices
in
the
hall
then
miss
painter
s
vigorous
hand
was
on
the
door
anna
stood
up
as
she
came
in
you
ve
found
him
i
ve
found
and
owen
has
she
seen
him
is
he
here
she
s
here
in
the
hall
she
wants
to
speak
to
here
now
anna
found
no
voice
for
more
she
drove
back
with
me
miss
painter
continued
in
the
tone
of
impartial
narrative
the
cabman
was
impertinent
i
ve
got
his
she
fumbled
in
a
stout
black
reticule
oh
i
can
t
broke
from
anna
but
she
collected
herself
remembering
that
to
betray
her
unwillingness
to
see
the
girl
was
to
risk
revealing
much
more
she
thought
you
might
be
too
tired
to
see
her
she
wouldn
t
come
in
till
i
d
found
anna
drew
a
quick
breath
an
instant
s
thought
had
told
her
that
sophy
viner
would
hardly
have
taken
such
a
step
unless
something
more
important
had
happened
ask
her
to
come
please
she
said
miss
painter
from
the
threshold
turned
back
to
announce
her
intention
of
going
immediately
to
the
police
station
to
report
the
cabman
s
delinquency
then
she
passed
out
and
sophy
viner
entered
the
look
in
the
girl
s
face
showed
that
she
had
indeed
come
unwillingly
yet
she
seemed
animated
by
an
eager
resoluteness
that
made
anna
ashamed
of
her
tremors
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
as
if
the
thoughts
between
them
were
packed
too
thick
for
speech
then
anna
said
in
a
voice
from
which
she
strove
to
take
the
edge
of
hardness
you
know
where
owen
is
miss
painter
tells
yes
that
was
my
reason
for
asking
you
to
see
sophy
spoke
simply
without
constraint
or
hesitation
i
thought
he
d
promised
you
anna
interposed
he
did
but
he
broke
his
promise
that
s
what
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
thank
anna
went
on
tentatively
he
left
givre
this
morning
without
a
word
i
followed
him
because
i
was
afraid
she
broke
off
again
and
the
girl
took
up
her
phrase
you
were
afraid
he
d
guessed
he
has
what
do
you
mean
guessed
what
that
you
know
something
he
doesn
t
something
that
made
you
glad
to
have
me
oh
anna
moaned
if
she
had
wanted
more
pain
she
had
it
now
he
s
told
you
this
she
faltered
he
hasn
t
told
me
because
i
haven
t
seen
him
i
kept
him
off
i
made
farlow
get
rid
of
him
but
he
s
written
me
what
he
came
to
say
and
that
was
oh
poor
owen
broke
from
anna
through
all
the
intricacies
of
her
suffering
she
felt
the
separate
pang
of
his
and
i
want
to
ask
you
the
girl
continued
to
let
me
see
him
for
of
course
she
added
in
the
same
strange
voice
of
energy
i
wouldn
t
unless
you
to
see
him
anna
tried
to
gather
together
her
startled
thoughts
what
use
would
it
be
what
could
you
tell
him
i
want
to
tell
him
the
truth
said
sophy
viner
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
and
a
burning
blush
rose
to
anna
s
forehead
i
don
t
understand
she
faltered
sophy
waited
a
moment
then
she
lowered
her
voice
to
say
i
don
t
want
him
to
think
worse
of
me
than
he
need
worse
yes
to
think
such
things
as
you
re
thinking
now
i
want
him
to
know
exactly
what
happened
then
i
want
to
bid
him
anna
tried
to
clear
a
way
through
her
own
wonder
and
confusion
she
felt
herself
obscurely
moved
wouldn
t
it
be
worse
for
him
to
hear
the
truth
it
would
be
better
at
any
rate
for
you
and
at
the
sound
of
the
name
anna
lifted
her
head
quickly
i
ve
only
my
to
consider
the
girl
threw
a
startled
look
at
her
you
don
t
mean
you
re
not
going
to
give
him
up
anna
felt
her
lips
harden
i
don
t
think
it
s
of
any
use
to
talk
of
oh
i
know
it
s
my
fault
for
not
knowing
how
to
say
what
i
want
you
to
hear
your
words
are
different
you
know
how
to
choose
them
mine
offend
you
and
the
dread
of
it
makes
me
blunder
that
s
why
the
other
day
i
couldn
t
say
anything
couldn
t
make
things
clear
to
you
but
now
must
even
if
you
hate
it
she
drew
a
step
nearer
her
slender
figure
swayed
forward
in
a
passion
of
entreaty
do
listen
to
me
what
you
ve
said
is
dreadful
how
can
you
speak
of
him
in
that
voice
don
t
you
see
that
i
went
away
so
that
he
shouldn
t
have
to
lose
you
anna
looked
at
her
coldly
are
you
speaking
of
darrow
i
don
t
know
why
you
think
your
going
or
staying
can
in
any
way
affect
our
you
mean
that
you
have
given
him
up
because
of
me
oh
how
could
you
you
can
t
really
love
him
and
yet
the
girl
suddenly
added
you
must
or
you
d
be
more
sorry
for
me
i
m
very
sorry
for
you
anna
said
feeling
as
if
the
iron
band
about
her
heart
pressed
on
it
a
little
less
inexorably
then
why
won
t
you
hear
me
why
won
t
you
try
to
understand
it
s
all
so
different
from
what
you
imagine
i
ve
never
judged
i
m
not
thinking
of
myself
he
loves
you
i
thought
you
d
come
to
speak
of
sophy
viner
seemed
not
to
hear
her
he
s
never
loved
any
one
else
even
those
few
days
i
knew
it
all
the
while
he
never
cared
for
please
don
t
say
any
more
anna
said
i
know
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
that
i
should
say
so
much
i
shock
you
i
offend
you
you
think
me
a
creature
without
shame
so
i
am
but
not
in
the
sense
you
think
i
m
not
ashamed
of
having
loved
him
no
and
i
m
not
ashamed
of
telling
you
so
it
s
that
that
justifies
me
and
him
too
oh
let
me
tell
you
how
it
happened
he
was
sorry
for
me
he
saw
i
cared
i
knew
that
was
all
he
ever
felt
i
could
see
he
was
thinking
of
some
one
else
i
knew
it
was
only
for
a
week
he
never
said
a
word
to
mislead
me
i
wanted
to
be
happy
just
once
and
i
didn
t
dream
of
the
harm
i
might
be
doing
him
anna
could
not
speak
she
hardly
knew
as
yet
what
the
girl
s
words
conveyed
to
her
save
the
sense
of
their
tragic
fervour
but
she
was
conscious
of
being
in
the
presence
of
an
intenser
passion
than
she
had
ever
felt
i
am
sorry
for
she
paused
but
why
do
you
say
this
to
me
after
another
interval
she
exclaimed
you
d
no
right
to
let
owen
love
no
that
was
wrong
at
least
what
s
happened
since
has
made
it
so
if
things
had
been
different
i
think
i
could
have
made
owen
happy
you
were
all
so
good
to
me
i
wanted
so
to
stay
with
you
i
suppose
you
ll
say
that
makes
it
worse
my
daring
to
dream
i
had
the
right
but
all
that
doesn
t
matter
now
i
won
t
see
owen
unless
you
re
willing
i
should
have
liked
to
tell
him
what
i
ve
tried
to
tell
you
but
you
must
know
better
you
feel
things
in
a
finer
way
only
you
ll
have
to
help
him
if
i
can
t
he
cares
a
great
deal
it
s
going
to
hurt
him
anna
trembled
oh
i
know
what
can
i
do
you
can
go
straight
back
to
givre
now
at
once
so
that
owen
shall
never
know
you
ve
followed
sophy
s
clasped
hands
reached
out
urgently
and
you
can
send
for
darrow
bring
him
back
owen
must
be
convinced
that
he
s
mistaken
and
nothing
else
will
convince
him
afterward
i
ll
find
a
pretext
oh
i
promise
you
but
first
he
must
see
for
himself
that
nothing
s
changed
for
anna
stood
motionless
subdued
and
dominated
the
girl
s
ardour
swept
her
like
a
wind
oh
can
t
i
move
you
some
day
you
ll
know
sophy
pleaded
her
eyes
full
of
tears
anna
saw
them
and
felt
a
fullness
in
her
throat
again
the
band
about
her
heart
seemed
loosened
she
wanted
to
find
a
word
but
could
not
all
within
her
was
too
dark
and
violent
she
gave
the
girl
a
speechless
look
i
do
believe
you
she
said
suddenly
then
she
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
xxxii
she
drove
from
miss
painter
s
to
her
own
apartment
the
who
had
it
in
charge
had
been
apprised
of
her
coming
and
had
opened
one
or
two
of
the
rooms
and
prepared
a
fire
in
her
bedroom
anna
shut
herself
in
refusing
the
woman
s
ministrations
she
felt
cold
and
faint
and
after
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
cloak
she
knelt
down
by
the
fire
and
stretched
her
hands
to
it
in
one
respect
at
least
it
was
clear
to
her
that
she
would
do
well
to
follow
sophy
viner
s
counsel
it
had
been
an
act
of
folly
to
follow
owen
and
her
first
business
was
to
get
back
to
givre
before
him
but
the
only
train
leaving
that
evening
was
a
slow
one
which
did
not
reach
francheuil
till
midnight
and
she
knew
that
her
taking
it
would
excite
madame
de
chantelle
s
wonder
and
lead
to
interminable
talk
she
had
come
up
to
paris
on
the
pretext
of
finding
a
new
governess
for
effie
and
the
natural
thing
was
to
defer
her
return
till
the
next
morning
she
knew
owen
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
would
make
another
attempt
to
see
miss
viner
and
failing
that
would
write
again
and
await
her
answer
so
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
his
reaching
givre
till
the
following
evening
her
sense
of
relief
at
not
having
to
start
out
at
once
showed
her
for
the
first
time
how
tired
she
was
the
bonne
had
suggested
a
cup
of
tea
but
the
dread
of
having
any
one
about
her
had
made
anna
refuse
and
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
morning
but
a
sandwich
bought
at
a
buffet
she
was
too
tired
to
get
up
but
stretching
out
her
arm
she
drew
toward
her
the
which
stood
beside
the
hearth
and
rested
her
head
against
its
cushions
gradually
the
warmth
of
the
fire
stole
into
her
veins
and
her
heaviness
of
soul
was
replaced
by
a
dreamy
buoyancy
she
seemed
to
be
seated
on
the
hearth
in
her
at
givre
and
darrow
was
beside
her
in
the
chair
against
which
she
leaned
he
put
his
arms
about
her
shoulders
and
drawing
her
head
back
looked
into
her
eyes
of
all
the
ways
you
do
your
hair
that
s
the
way
i
like
best
he
said
a
log
dropped
and
she
sat
up
with
a
start
there
was
a
warmth
in
her
heart
and
she
was
smiling
then
she
looked
about
her
and
saw
where
she
was
and
the
glory
fell
she
hid
her
face
and
sobbed
presently
she
perceived
that
it
was
growing
dark
and
getting
up
stiffly
she
began
to
undo
the
things
in
her
bag
and
spread
them
on
the
she
shrank
from
lighting
the
lights
and
groped
her
way
about
trying
to
find
what
she
needed
she
seemed
immeasurably
far
off
from
every
one
and
most
of
all
from
herself
it
was
as
if
her
consciousness
had
been
transmitted
to
some
stranger
whose
thoughts
and
gestures
were
indifferent
to
her
suddenly
she
heard
a
shrill
tinkle
and
with
a
beating
heart
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
was
the
telephone
in
her
a
call
no
doubt
from
adelaide
painter
or
could
owen
have
learned
she
was
in
town
the
thought
alarmed
her
and
she
opened
the
door
and
stumbled
across
the
unlit
room
to
the
instrument
she
held
it
to
her
ear
and
heard
darrow
s
voice
pronounce
her
name
will
you
let
me
see
you
i
ve
come
back
i
had
to
come
miss
painter
told
me
you
were
she
began
to
tremble
and
feared
that
he
would
guess
it
from
her
voice
she
did
not
know
what
she
answered
she
heard
him
say
i
can
t
she
called
yes
and
laid
the
telephone
down
and
caught
it
up
again
but
he
was
gone
she
wondered
if
her
yes
had
reached
him
she
sat
in
her
chair
and
listened
why
had
she
said
that
she
would
see
him
what
did
she
mean
to
say
to
him
when
he
came
now
and
then
as
she
sat
there
the
sense
of
his
presence
enveloped
her
as
in
her
dream
and
she
shut
her
eyes
and
felt
his
arms
about
her
then
she
woke
to
reality
and
shivered
a
long
time
elapsed
and
at
length
she
said
to
herself
he
isn
t
the
rang
as
she
said
it
and
she
stood
up
cold
and
trembling
she
thought
can
he
imagine
there
s
any
use
in
coming
and
moved
forward
to
bid
the
servant
say
she
could
not
see
him
the
door
opened
and
she
saw
him
standing
in
the
the
room
was
cold
and
fireless
and
a
hard
glare
fell
from
the
on
the
shrouded
furniture
and
the
white
slips
covering
the
curtains
he
looked
pale
and
stern
with
a
frown
of
fatigue
between
his
eyes
and
she
remembered
that
in
three
days
he
had
travelled
from
givre
to
london
and
back
it
seemed
incredible
that
all
that
had
befallen
her
should
have
been
compressed
within
the
space
of
three
days
thank
you
he
said
as
she
came
in
she
answered
it
s
better
i
suppose
he
came
toward
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
she
struggled
a
little
afraid
of
yielding
but
he
pressed
her
to
him
not
bending
to
her
but
holding
her
fast
as
though
he
had
found
her
after
a
long
search
she
heard
his
hurried
breathing
it
seemed
to
come
from
her
own
breast
so
close
he
held
her
and
it
was
she
who
at
last
lifted
up
her
face
and
drew
down
his
she
freed
herself
and
went
and
sat
on
a
sofa
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
mirror
between
the
shrouded
showed
her
crumpled
travelling
dress
and
the
white
face
under
her
disordered
hair
she
found
her
voice
and
asked
him
how
he
had
been
able
to
leave
london
he
answered
that
he
had
managed
he
d
arranged
it
and
she
saw
he
hardly
heard
what
she
was
saying
i
had
to
see
you
he
went
on
and
moved
nearer
sitting
down
at
her
side
yes
we
must
think
of
owen
oh
owen
her
mind
had
flown
back
to
sophy
viner
s
plea
that
she
should
let
darrow
return
to
givre
in
order
that
owen
might
be
persuaded
of
the
folly
of
his
suspicions
the
suggestion
was
absurd
of
course
she
could
not
ask
darrow
to
lend
himself
to
such
a
fraud
even
had
she
had
the
inhuman
courage
to
play
her
part
in
it
she
was
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
the
futility
of
every
attempt
to
reconstruct
her
ruined
world
no
it
was
useless
and
since
it
was
useless
every
moment
with
darrow
was
pure
pain
i
ve
come
to
talk
of
myself
not
of
owen
she
heard
him
saying
when
you
sent
me
away
the
other
day
i
understood
that
it
couldn
t
be
otherwise
then
but
it
s
not
possible
that
you
and
i
should
part
like
that
if
i
m
to
lose
you
it
must
be
for
a
better
a
better
reason
yes
a
deeper
one
one
that
means
a
fundamental
disaccord
between
us
this
one
doesn
t
in
spite
of
everything
it
doesn
t
that
s
what
i
want
you
to
see
and
have
the
courage
to
if
i
saw
it
i
should
have
the
courage
yes
courage
was
the
wrong
word
you
have
that
that
s
why
i
m
but
i
don
t
see
it
she
continued
sadly
so
it
s
useless
isn
t
it
and
so
cruel
he
was
about
to
speak
but
she
went
on
i
shall
never
understand
it
never
he
looked
at
her
you
will
some
day
you
were
made
to
feel
everything
i
should
have
thought
this
was
a
case
of
not
feeling
on
my
part
you
mean
he
faced
her
resolutely
yes
it
was
to
my
shame
what
i
meant
was
that
when
you
ve
lived
a
little
longer
you
ll
see
what
complex
blunderers
we
all
are
how
we
re
struck
blind
sometimes
and
mad
sometimes
and
then
when
our
sight
and
our
senses
come
back
how
we
have
to
set
to
work
and
build
up
little
by
little
bit
by
bit
the
precious
things
we
d
smashed
to
atoms
without
knowing
it
life
s
just
a
perpetual
piecing
together
of
broken
she
looked
up
quickly
that
s
what
i
feel
that
you
ought
to
he
stood
up
interrupting
her
with
a
gesture
oh
don
t
don
t
say
what
you
re
going
to
men
don
t
give
their
lives
away
like
that
if
you
won
t
have
mine
it
s
at
least
my
own
to
do
the
best
i
can
the
best
you
can
that
s
what
i
mean
how
can
there
be
a
best
for
you
that
s
made
of
some
one
else
s
worst
he
sat
down
again
with
a
groan
i
don
t
know
it
seemed
such
a
slight
thing
all
on
the
surface
and
i
ve
gone
aground
on
it
because
it
was
on
the
surface
i
see
the
horror
of
it
just
as
you
do
but
i
see
a
little
more
clearly
the
extent
and
the
limits
of
my
wrong
it
s
not
as
black
as
you
she
lowered
her
voice
to
say
i
suppose
i
shall
never
understand
but
she
seems
to
love
you
there
s
my
shame
that
i
didn
t
guess
it
didn
t
fly
from
it
you
say
you
ll
never
understand
but
why
shouldn
t
you
is
it
anything
to
be
proud
of
to
know
so
little
of
the
strings
that
pull
us
if
you
knew
a
little
more
i
could
tell
you
how
such
things
happen
without
offending
you
and
perhaps
you
d
listen
without
condemning
i
don
t
condemn
she
was
dizzy
with
struggling
impulses
she
longed
to
cry
out
i
do
understand
i
ve
understood
ever
since
you
ve
been
here
for
she
was
aware
in
her
own
bosom
of
sensations
so
separate
from
her
romantic
thoughts
of
him
that
she
saw
her
body
and
soul
divided
against
themselves
she
recalled
having
read
somewhere
that
in
ancient
rome
the
slaves
were
not
allowed
to
wear
a
distinctive
dress
lest
they
should
recognize
each
other
and
learn
their
numbers
and
their
power
so
in
herself
she
discerned
for
the
first
time
instincts
and
desires
which
mute
and
unmarked
had
gone
to
and
fro
in
the
dim
passages
of
her
mind
and
now
hailed
each
other
with
a
cry
of
mutiny
oh
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
she
broke
out
you
say
you
didn
t
know
she
loved
you
but
you
know
it
now
doesn
t
that
show
you
how
you
can
put
the
broken
bits
together
can
you
seriously
think
it
would
be
doing
so
to
marry
one
woman
while
i
care
for
another
oh
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
the
sense
of
her
weakness
made
her
try
to
harden
herself
against
his
arguments
you
do
know
we
ve
often
talked
of
such
things
of
the
monstrousness
of
useless
sacrifices
if
i
m
to
expiate
it
s
not
in
that
he
added
abruptly
it
s
in
having
to
say
this
to
you
now
she
found
no
answer
through
the
silent
apartment
they
heard
the
sudden
peal
of
the
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
owen
she
instantly
exclaimed
is
owen
in
paris
she
explained
in
a
rapid
undertone
what
she
had
learned
from
sophy
viner
shall
i
leave
you
darrow
asked
yes
no
she
moved
to
the
door
with
the
purpose
of
making
him
pass
out
and
then
turned
back
it
may
be
they
heard
the
outer
door
open
and
a
moment
later
owen
walked
into
the
room
he
was
pale
with
excited
eyes
as
they
fell
on
darrow
anna
saw
his
start
of
wonder
he
made
a
slight
sign
of
recognition
and
then
went
up
to
his
with
an
air
of
exaggerated
gaiety
you
furtive
person
i
ran
across
the
omniscient
adelaide
and
heard
from
her
that
you
d
rushed
up
suddenly
and
he
stood
between
anna
and
darrow
strained
questioning
dangerously
on
edge
i
came
up
to
meet
darrow
anna
answered
his
leave
s
been
prolonged
he
s
going
back
with
the
words
seemed
to
have
uttered
themselves
without
her
will
yet
she
felt
a
great
sense
of
freedom
as
she
spoke
them
the
hard
tension
of
owen
s
face
changed
to
incredulous
surprise
he
looked
at
darrow
the
merest
luck
a
colleague
whose
wife
was
ill
i
came
straight
back
she
heard
the
latter
tranquilly
explaining
his
helped
to
steady
her
and
she
smiled
at
owen
we
ll
all
go
back
together
tomorrow
morning
she
said
as
she
slipped
her
arm
through
his
xxxiii
owen
leath
did
not
go
back
with
his
to
givre
in
reply
to
her
suggestion
he
announced
his
intention
of
staying
on
a
day
or
two
longer
in
paris
anna
left
alone
by
the
first
train
the
next
morning
darrow
was
to
follow
in
the
afternoon
when
owen
had
left
them
the
evening
before
darrow
waited
a
moment
for
her
to
speak
then
as
she
said
nothing
he
asked
her
if
she
really
wished
him
to
return
to
givre
she
made
a
mute
sign
of
assent
and
he
added
for
you
know
that
much
as
i
m
ready
to
do
for
owen
i
can
t
do
that
for
him
i
can
t
go
back
to
be
sent
away
no
no
he
came
nearer
and
looked
at
her
and
she
went
to
him
all
her
fears
seemed
to
fall
from
her
as
he
held
her
it
was
a
different
feeling
from
any
she
had
known
before
confused
and
turbid
as
if
secret
shames
and
rancours
stirred
in
it
yet
richer
deeper
more
enslaving
she
leaned
her
head
back
and
shut
her
eyes
beneath
his
kisses
she
knew
now
that
she
could
never
give
him
up
nevertheless
she
asked
him
the
next
morning
to
let
her
go
back
alone
to
givre
she
wanted
time
to
think
she
was
convinced
that
what
had
happened
was
inevitable
that
she
and
darrow
belonged
to
each
other
and
that
he
was
right
in
saying
no
past
folly
could
ever
put
them
asunder
if
there
was
a
shade
of
difference
in
her
feeling
for
him
it
was
that
of
an
added
intensity
she
felt
restless
insecure
out
of
his
sight
she
had
a
sense
of
incompleteness
of
passionate
dependence
that
was
somehow
at
variance
with
her
own
conception
of
her
character
it
was
partly
the
consciousness
of
this
change
in
herself
that
made
her
want
to
be
alone
the
solitude
of
her
inner
life
had
given
her
the
habit
of
these
hours
of
and
she
needed
them
as
she
needed
her
morning
plunge
into
cold
water
during
the
journey
she
tried
to
review
what
had
happened
in
the
light
of
her
new
decision
and
of
her
sudden
relief
from
pain
she
seemed
to
herself
to
have
passed
through
some
fiery
initiation
from
which
she
had
emerged
seared
and
quivering
but
clutching
to
her
breast
a
magic
talisman
sophy
viner
had
cried
out
to
her
some
day
you
ll
know
and
darrow
had
used
the
same
words
they
meant
she
supposed
that
when
she
had
explored
the
intricacies
and
darknesses
of
her
own
heart
her
judgment
of
others
would
be
less
absolute
well
she
knew
now
knew
weaknesses
and
strengths
she
had
not
dreamed
of
and
the
deep
discord
and
still
deeper
complicities
between
what
thought
in
her
and
what
blindly
wanted
her
mind
turned
anxiously
to
owen
at
least
the
blow
that
was
to
fall
on
him
would
not
seem
to
have
been
inflicted
by
her
hand
he
would
be
left
with
the
impression
that
his
breach
with
sophy
viner
was
due
to
one
of
the
ordinary
causes
of
such
disruptions
though
he
must
lose
her
his
memory
of
her
would
not
be
poisoned
anna
never
for
a
moment
permitted
herself
the
delusion
that
she
had
renewed
her
promise
to
darrow
in
order
to
spare
her
this
last
refinement
of
misery
she
knew
she
had
been
prompted
by
the
irresistible
impulse
to
hold
fast
to
what
was
most
precious
to
her
and
that
owen
s
arrival
on
the
scene
had
been
the
pretext
for
her
decision
and
not
its
cause
yet
she
felt
herself
fortified
by
the
thought
of
what
she
had
spared
him
it
was
as
though
a
star
she
had
been
used
to
follow
had
shed
its
familiar
ray
on
ways
unknown
to
her
all
through
these
meditations
ran
the
undercurrent
of
an
absolute
trust
in
sophy
viner
she
thought
of
the
girl
with
a
mingling
of
antipathy
and
confidence
it
was
humiliating
to
her
pride
to
recognize
kindred
impulses
in
a
character
which
she
would
have
liked
to
feel
completely
alien
to
her
but
what
indeed
was
the
girl
really
like
she
seemed
to
have
no
scruples
and
a
thousand
delicacies
she
had
given
herself
to
darrow
and
concealed
the
episode
from
owen
leath
with
no
more
apparent
sense
of
debasement
than
the
vulgarest
of
adventuresses
yet
she
had
instantly
obeyed
the
voice
of
her
heart
when
it
bade
her
part
from
the
one
and
serve
the
other
anna
tried
to
picture
what
the
girl
s
life
must
have
been
what
experiences
what
initiations
had
formed
her
but
her
own
training
had
been
too
different
there
were
veils
she
could
not
lift
she
looked
back
at
her
married
life
and
its
colourless
uniformity
took
on
an
air
of
high
restraint
and
order
was
it
because
she
had
been
so
incurious
that
it
had
worn
that
look
to
her
it
struck
her
with
amazement
that
she
had
never
given
a
thought
to
her
husband
s
past
or
wondered
what
he
did
and
where
he
went
when
he
was
away
from
her
if
she
had
been
asked
what
she
supposed
he
thought
about
when
they
were
apart
she
would
instantly
have
answered
his
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
have
passions
interests
preoccupations
of
which
she
was
absolutely
ignorant
yet
he
went
up
to
paris
rather
regularly
ostensibly
to
attend
sales
and
exhibitions
or
to
confer
with
dealers
and
collectors
she
tried
to
picture
him
straight
trim
beautifully
brushed
and
varnished
walking
furtively
down
a
quiet
street
and
looking
about
him
before
he
slipped
into
a
doorway
she
understood
now
that
she
had
been
cold
to
him
what
more
likely
than
that
he
had
sought
compensations
all
men
were
like
that
she
supposed
no
doubt
her
simplicity
had
amused
him
in
the
act
of
transposing
fraser
leath
into
a
don
juan
she
was
pulled
up
by
the
ironic
perception
that
she
was
simply
trying
to
justify
darrow
she
wanted
to
think
that
all
men
were
like
that
because
darrow
was
like
that
she
wanted
to
justify
her
acceptance
of
the
fact
by
persuading
herself
that
only
through
such
concessions
could
women
like
herself
hope
to
keep
what
they
could
not
give
up
and
suddenly
she
was
filled
with
anger
at
her
blindness
and
then
at
her
disastrous
attempt
to
see
why
had
she
forced
the
truth
out
of
darrow
if
only
she
had
held
her
tongue
nothing
need
ever
have
been
known
sophy
viner
would
have
broken
her
engagement
owen
would
have
been
sent
around
the
world
and
her
own
dream
would
have
been
unshattered
but
she
had
probed
insisted
not
rested
till
she
had
dragged
the
secret
to
the
light
she
was
one
of
the
luckless
women
who
always
have
the
wrong
audacities
and
who
always
know
it
was
it
she
anna
leath
who
was
picturing
herself
to
herself
in
that
way
she
recoiled
from
her
thoughts
as
if
with
a
sense
of
demoniac
possession
and
there
flashed
through
her
the
longing
to
return
to
her
old
state
of
fearless
ignorance
if
at
that
moment
she
could
have
kept
darrow
from
following
her
to
givre
she
would
have
done
so
but
he
came
and
with
the
sight
of
him
the
turmoil
fell
and
she
felt
herself
reassured
rehabilitated
he
arrived
toward
dusk
and
she
motored
to
francheuil
to
meet
him
she
wanted
to
see
him
as
soon
as
possible
for
she
had
divined
through
the
new
insight
that
was
in
her
that
only
his
presence
could
restore
her
to
a
normal
view
of
things
in
the
motor
as
they
left
the
town
and
turned
into
the
he
lifted
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
she
leaned
against
him
and
felt
the
currents
flow
between
them
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
not
saying
anything
and
for
not
expecting
her
to
speak
she
said
to
herself
he
never
makes
a
mistake
he
always
knows
what
to
do
and
then
she
thought
with
a
start
that
it
was
doubtless
because
he
had
so
often
been
in
such
situations
the
idea
that
his
tact
was
a
kind
of
professional
expertness
filled
her
with
repugnance
and
insensibly
she
drew
away
from
him
he
made
no
motion
to
bring
her
nearer
and
she
instantly
thought
that
that
was
calculated
too
she
sat
beside
him
in
frozen
misery
wondering
whether
henceforth
she
would
measure
in
this
way
his
every
look
and
gesture
neither
of
them
spoke
again
till
the
motor
turned
under
the
dark
arch
of
the
avenue
and
they
saw
the
lights
of
givre
twinkling
at
its
end
then
darrow
laid
his
hand
on
hers
and
said
i
know
dear
and
the
hardness
in
her
melted
he
s
suffering
as
i
am
she
thought
and
for
a
moment
the
baleful
fact
between
them
seemed
to
draw
them
closer
instead
of
walling
them
up
in
their
separate
wretchedness
it
was
wonderful
to
be
once
more
the
doors
of
givre
with
him
and
as
the
old
house
received
them
into
its
mellow
silence
she
had
again
the
sense
of
passing
out
of
a
dreadful
dream
into
the
reassurance
of
kindly
and
familiar
things
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
these
quiet
rooms
so
full
of
the
accumulations
of
a
fastidious
taste
should
have
been
the
scene
of
tragic
dissensions
the
memory
of
them
seemed
to
be
shut
out
into
the
night
with
the
closing
and
barring
of
its
doors
at
the
in
the
they
found
madame
de
chantelle
and
effie
the
little
girl
catching
sight
of
darrow
raced
down
the
to
meet
him
and
returned
in
triumph
on
his
shoulder
anna
looked
at
them
with
a
smile
effie
for
all
her
graces
was
chary
of
such
favours
and
her
mother
knew
that
in
according
them
to
darrow
she
had
admitted
him
to
the
circle
where
owen
had
hitherto
ruled
over
the
darrow
gave
madame
de
chantelle
the
explanation
of
his
sudden
return
from
england
on
reaching
london
he
told
her
he
had
found
that
the
secretary
he
was
to
have
replaced
was
detained
there
by
the
illness
of
his
wife
the
ambassador
knowing
darrow
s
urgent
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
in
france
had
immediately
proposed
his
going
back
and
awaiting
at
givre
the
summons
to
relieve
his
colleague
and
he
had
jumped
into
the
first
train
without
even
waiting
to
telegraph
the
news
of
his
release
he
spoke
naturally
easily
in
his
usual
quiet
voice
taking
his
tea
from
effie
helping
himself
to
the
toast
she
handed
and
stooping
now
and
then
to
stroke
the
dozing
terrier
and
suddenly
as
anna
listened
to
his
explanation
she
asked
herself
if
it
were
true
the
question
of
course
was
absurd
there
was
no
possible
reason
why
he
should
invent
a
false
account
of
his
return
and
every
probability
that
the
version
he
gave
was
the
real
one
but
he
had
looked
and
spoken
in
the
same
way
when
he
had
answered
her
probing
questions
about
sophy
viner
and
she
reflected
with
a
chill
of
fear
that
she
would
never
again
know
if
he
were
speaking
the
truth
or
not
she
was
sure
he
loved
her
and
she
did
not
fear
his
insincerity
as
much
as
her
own
distrust
of
him
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
must
corrupt
the
very
source
of
love
then
she
said
to
herself
by
and
bye
when
i
am
altogether
his
we
shall
be
so
near
each
other
that
there
will
be
no
room
for
any
doubts
between
but
the
doubts
were
there
now
one
moment
lulled
to
quiescence
the
next
more
torturingly
alert
when
the
nurse
appeared
to
summon
effie
the
little
girl
after
kissing
her
grandmother
entrenched
herself
on
darrow
s
knee
with
the
imperious
demand
to
be
carried
up
to
bed
and
anna
while
she
laughingly
protested
said
to
herself
with
a
pang
can
i
give
her
a
father
about
whom
i
think
such
things
the
thought
of
effie
and
of
what
she
owed
to
effie
had
been
the
fundamental
reason
for
her
delays
and
hesitations
when
she
and
darrow
had
come
together
again
in
england
her
own
feeling
was
so
clear
that
but
for
that
scruple
she
would
have
put
her
hand
in
his
at
once
but
till
she
had
seen
him
again
she
had
never
considered
the
possibility
of
and
when
it
suddenly
confronted
her
it
seemed
for
the
moment
to
disorganize
the
life
she
had
planned
for
herself
and
her
child
she
had
not
spoken
of
this
to
darrow
because
it
appeared
to
her
a
subject
to
be
debated
within
her
own
conscience
the
question
then
was
not
as
to
his
fitness
to
become
the
guide
and
guardian
of
her
child
nor
did
she
fear
that
her
love
for
him
would
deprive
effie
of
the
least
fraction
of
her
tenderness
since
she
did
not
think
of
love
as
something
measured
and
exhaustible
but
as
a
treasure
perpetually
renewed
what
she
questioned
was
her
right
to
introduce
into
her
life
any
interests
and
duties
which
might
rob
effie
of
a
part
of
her
time
or
lessen
the
closeness
of
their
daily
intercourse
she
had
decided
this
question
as
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
but
now
another
was
before
her
assuredly
at
her
age
there
was
no
possible
reason
why
she
should
cloister
herself
to
bring
up
her
daughter
but
there
was
every
reason
for
not
marrying
a
man
in
whom
her
own
faith
was
not
complete
xxxiv
when
she
woke
the
next
morning
she
felt
a
great
lightness
of
heart
she
recalled
her
last
awakening
at
givre
three
days
before
when
it
had
seemed
as
though
all
her
life
had
gone
down
in
darkness
now
darrow
was
once
more
under
the
same
roof
with
her
and
once
more
his
nearness
sufficed
to
make
the
looming
horror
drop
away
she
could
almost
have
smiled
at
her
scruples
of
the
night
before
as
she
looked
back
on
them
they
seemed
to
belong
to
the
old
ignorant
timorous
time
when
she
had
feared
to
look
life
in
the
face
and
had
been
blind
to
the
mysteries
and
contradictions
of
the
human
heart
because
her
own
had
not
been
revealed
to
her
darrow
had
said
you
were
made
to
feel
everything
and
to
feel
was
surely
better
than
to
judge
when
she
came
downstairs
he
was
already
in
the
with
effie
and
madame
de
chantelle
and
the
sense
of
reassurance
which
his
presence
gave
her
was
merged
in
the
relief
of
not
being
able
to
speak
of
what
was
between
them
but
there
it
was
inevitably
and
whenever
they
looked
at
each
other
they
saw
it
in
her
dread
of
giving
it
a
more
tangible
shape
she
tried
to
devise
means
of
keeping
the
little
girl
with
her
and
when
the
latter
had
been
called
away
by
the
nurse
found
an
excuse
for
following
madame
de
chantelle
upstairs
to
the
purple
but
a
confidential
talk
with
madame
de
chantelle
implied
the
detailed
discussion
of
plans
of
which
anna
could
hardly
yet
bear
to
consider
the
vaguest
outline
the
date
of
her
marriage
the
relative
advantages
of
sailing
from
london
or
lisbon
the
possibility
of
hiring
a
habitable
house
at
their
new
post
and
when
these
problems
were
exhausted
the
application
of
the
same
method
to
the
subject
of
owen
s
future
his
grandmother
having
no
suspicion
of
the
real
reason
of
sophy
viner
s
departure
had
thought
it
extremely
suitable
of
the
young
girl
to
withdraw
to
the
shelter
of
her
old
friends
roof
in
the
hour
of
bridal
preparation
this
maidenly
retreat
had
in
fact
impressed
madame
de
chantelle
so
favourably
that
she
was
disposed
for
the
first
time
to
talk
over
owen
s
projects
and
as
every
human
event
translated
itself
for
her
into
terms
of
social
and
domestic
detail
anna
had
perforce
to
travel
the
same
round
again
she
felt
a
momentary
relief
when
darrow
presently
joined
them
but
his
coming
served
only
to
draw
the
conversation
back
to
the
question
of
their
own
future
and
anna
felt
a
new
pang
as
she
heard
him
calmly
and
lucidly
discussing
it
did
such
imply
indifference
or
insincerity
in
that
problem
her
mind
perpetually
revolved
and
she
dreaded
the
one
answer
as
much
as
the
other
she
was
resolved
to
keep
on
her
course
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
marry
darrow
and
never
let
the
consciousness
of
the
past
intrude
itself
between
them
but
she
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
only
way
of
attaining
to
this
state
of
detachment
from
the
irreparable
was
once
for
all
to
turn
back
with
him
to
its
contemplation
as
soon
as
this
desire
had
germinated
it
became
so
strong
in
her
that
she
regretted
having
promised
effie
to
take
her
out
for
the
afternoon
but
she
could
think
of
no
pretext
for
disappointing
the
little
girl
and
soon
after
luncheon
the
three
set
forth
in
the
motor
to
show
darrow
a
chateau
famous
in
the
annals
of
the
region
during
their
excursion
anna
found
it
impossible
to
guess
from
his
demeanour
if
effie
s
presence
between
them
was
as
much
of
a
strain
to
his
composure
as
to
hers
he
remained
imperturbably
and
appreciative
while
they
went
the
round
of
the
monument
and
she
remarked
only
that
when
he
thought
himself
unnoticed
his
face
grew
grave
and
his
answers
came
less
promptly
on
the
way
back
two
or
three
miles
from
givre
she
suddenly
proposed
that
they
should
walk
home
through
the
forest
which
skirted
that
side
of
the
park
darrow
acquiesced
and
they
got
out
and
sent
effie
on
in
the
motor
their
way
led
through
a
bit
of
sober
french
woodland
flat
as
a
faded
tapestry
but
with
gleams
of
live
emerald
lingering
here
and
there
among
its
browns
and
ochres
the
luminous
grey
air
gave
vividness
to
its
dying
colours
and
veiled
the
distant
glimpses
of
the
landscape
in
soft
uncertainty
in
such
a
solitude
anna
had
fancied
it
would
be
easier
to
speak
but
as
she
walked
beside
darrow
over
the
deep
soundless
flooring
of
brown
moss
the
words
on
her
lips
took
flight
again
it
seemed
impossible
to
break
the
spell
of
quiet
joy
which
his
presence
laid
on
her
and
when
he
began
to
talk
of
the
place
they
had
just
visited
she
answered
his
questions
and
then
waited
for
what
he
should
say
next
no
decidedly
she
could
not
speak
she
no
longer
even
knew
what
she
had
meant
to
say
the
same
experience
repeated
itself
several
times
that
day
and
the
next
when
she
and
darrow
were
apart
she
exhausted
herself
in
appeal
and
interrogation
she
formulated
with
a
fervent
lucidity
every
point
in
her
imaginary
argument
but
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
with
him
something
deeper
than
reason
and
subtler
than
shyness
laid
its
benumbing
touch
upon
her
and
the
desire
to
speak
became
merely
a
dim
disquietude
through
which
his
looks
his
words
his
touch
reached
her
as
through
a
mist
of
bodily
pain
yet
this
inertia
was
torn
by
wild
flashes
of
resistance
and
when
they
were
apart
she
began
to
prepare
again
what
she
meant
to
say
to
him
she
knew
he
could
not
be
with
her
without
being
aware
of
this
inner
turmoil
and
she
hoped
he
would
break
the
spell
by
some
releasing
word
but
she
presently
understood
that
he
recognized
the
futility
of
words
and
was
resolutely
bent
on
holding
her
to
her
own
purpose
of
behaving
as
if
nothing
had
happened
once
more
she
inwardly
accused
him
of
insensibility
and
her
imagination
was
beset
by
tormenting
visions
of
his
past
had
such
things
happened
to
him
before
if
the
episode
had
been
an
isolated
accident
a
moment
of
folly
and
madness
as
he
had
called
it
she
could
understand
or
at
least
begin
to
understand
for
at
a
certain
point
her
imagination
always
turned
back
but
if
it
were
a
mere
link
in
a
chain
of
similar
experiments
the
thought
of
it
dishonoured
her
whole
past
effie
in
the
interregnum
between
governesses
had
been
given
leave
to
dine
downstairs
and
anna
on
the
evening
of
darrow
s
return
kept
the
little
girl
with
her
till
long
after
the
nurse
had
signalled
from
the
door
when
at
length
she
had
been
carried
off
anna
proposed
a
game
of
cards
and
after
this
diversion
had
drawn
to
its
languid
close
she
said
to
darrow
and
followed
madame
de
chantelle
upstairs
but
madame
de
chantelle
never
sat
up
late
and
the
second
evening
with
the
amiably
implied
intention
of
leaving
anna
and
darrow
to
themselves
she
took
an
earlier
leave
of
them
than
usual
anna
sat
silent
listening
to
her
small
stiff
steps
as
they
minced
down
the
hall
and
died
out
in
the
distance
madame
de
chantelle
had
broken
her
wooden
embroidery
frame
and
darrow
having
offered
to
repair
it
had
drawn
his
chair
up
to
a
table
that
held
a
lamp
anna
watched
him
as
he
sat
with
bent
head
and
knitted
brows
trying
to
fit
together
the
disjoined
pieces
the
sight
of
him
so
tranquilly
absorbed
in
this
trifling
business
seemed
to
give
to
the
quiet
room
a
perfume
of
intimacy
to
fill
it
with
a
sense
of
sweet
familiar
habit
and
it
came
over
her
again
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
inner
thoughts
of
this
man
who
was
sitting
by
her
as
a
husband
might
the
lamplight
fell
on
his
white
forehead
on
the
healthy
brown
of
his
cheek
the
backs
of
his
thin
sunburnt
hands
as
she
watched
the
hands
her
sense
of
them
became
as
vivid
as
a
touch
and
she
said
to
herself
that
other
woman
has
sat
and
watched
him
as
i
am
doing
she
has
known
him
as
i
have
never
known
him
perhaps
he
is
thinking
of
that
now
or
perhaps
he
has
forgotten
it
all
as
completely
as
i
have
forgotten
everything
that
happened
to
me
before
he
came
he
looked
young
active
stored
with
strength
and
energy
not
the
man
for
vain
repinings
or
long
memories
she
wondered
what
she
had
to
hold
or
satisfy
him
he
loved
her
now
she
had
no
doubt
of
that
but
how
could
she
hope
to
keep
him
they
were
so
nearly
of
an
age
that
already
she
felt
herself
his
senior
as
yet
the
difference
was
not
visible
outwardly
at
least
they
were
matched
but
or
unhappiness
would
soon
do
away
with
this
equality
she
thought
with
a
pang
of
bitterness
he
won
t
grow
any
older
because
he
doesn
t
feel
things
and
because
he
doesn
t
i
shall
and
when
she
ceased
to
please
him
what
then
had
he
the
tradition
of
faith
to
the
spoken
vow
or
the
deeper
piety
of
the
unspoken
dedication
what
was
his
theory
what
his
inner
conviction
in
such
matters
but
what
did
she
care
for
his
convictions
or
his
theories
no
doubt
he
loved
her
now
and
believed
he
would
always
go
on
loving
her
and
was
persuaded
that
if
he
ceased
to
his
loyalty
would
be
proof
against
the
change
what
she
wanted
to
know
was
not
what
he
thought
about
it
in
advance
but
what
would
impel
or
restrain
him
at
the
crucial
hour
she
put
no
faith
in
her
own
arts
she
was
too
sure
of
having
none
and
if
some
beneficent
enchanter
had
bestowed
them
on
her
she
knew
now
that
she
would
have
rejected
the
gift
she
could
hardly
conceive
of
wanting
the
kind
of
love
that
was
a
state
one
could
be
cozened
into
darrow
putting
away
the
frame
walked
across
the
room
and
sat
down
beside
her
and
she
felt
he
had
something
special
to
say
they
re
sure
to
send
for
me
in
a
day
or
two
now
he
began
she
made
no
answer
and
he
continued
you
ll
tell
me
before
i
go
what
day
i
m
to
come
back
and
get
you
it
was
the
first
time
since
his
return
to
givre
that
he
had
made
any
direct
allusion
to
the
date
of
their
marriage
and
instead
of
answering
him
she
broke
out
there
s
something
i
ve
been
wanting
you
to
know
the
other
day
in
paris
i
saw
miss
she
saw
him
flush
with
the
intensity
of
his
surprise
you
sent
for
her
no
she
heard
from
adelaide
that
i
was
in
paris
and
she
came
she
came
because
she
wanted
to
urge
me
to
marry
you
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
what
she
had
darrow
stood
up
i
m
glad
you
ve
told
he
spoke
with
a
visible
effort
at
composure
her
eyes
followed
him
as
he
moved
away
is
that
all
he
asked
after
an
interval
it
seems
to
me
a
great
it
s
what
she
d
already
asked
his
voice
showed
her
how
deeply
he
was
moved
and
a
throb
of
jealousy
shot
through
her
oh
it
was
for
your
sake
i
know
he
made
no
answer
and
she
added
she
s
been
exceedingly
generous
why
shouldn
t
we
speak
of
it
she
had
lowered
her
head
but
through
her
dropped
lids
she
seemed
to
be
watching
the
crowded
scene
of
his
face
i
ve
not
shrunk
from
speaking
of
speaking
of
her
then
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
could
talk
to
you
about
her
i
should
know
better
she
broke
off
confused
and
he
questioned
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
better
the
colour
rose
to
her
forehead
how
could
she
tell
him
what
she
scarcely
dared
own
to
herself
there
was
nothing
she
did
not
want
to
know
no
fold
or
cranny
of
his
secret
that
her
awakened
imagination
did
not
strain
to
penetrate
but
she
could
not
expose
sophy
viner
to
the
base
fingerings
of
a
retrospective
jealousy
nor
darrow
to
the
temptation
of
belittling
her
in
the
effort
to
better
his
own
case
the
girl
had
been
magnificent
and
the
only
worthy
return
that
anna
could
make
was
to
take
darrow
from
her
without
a
question
if
she
took
him
at
all
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
i
think
i
only
wanted
to
speak
her
name
it
s
not
right
that
we
should
seem
so
afraid
of
it
if
i
were
really
afraid
of
it
i
should
have
to
give
you
up
she
said
he
bent
over
her
and
caught
her
to
him
ah
you
can
t
give
me
up
now
he
exclaimed
she
suffered
him
to
hold
her
fast
without
speaking
but
the
old
dread
was
between
them
again
and
it
was
on
her
lips
to
cry
out
how
can
i
help
it
when
i
am
so
afraid
xxxv
the
next
morning
the
dread
was
still
there
and
she
understood
that
she
must
snatch
herself
out
of
the
torpor
of
the
will
into
which
she
had
been
gradually
sinking
and
tell
darrow
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
the
knowledge
came
to
her
in
the
watches
of
a
sleepless
night
when
through
the
tears
of
disenchanted
passion
she
stared
back
upon
her
past
there
it
lay
before
her
her
sole
romance
in
all
its
paltry
poverty
the
cheapest
of
cheap
adventures
the
most
pitiful
of
sentimental
blunders
she
looked
about
her
room
the
room
where
for
so
many
years
if
her
heart
had
been
quiescent
her
thoughts
had
been
alive
and
pictured
herself
henceforth
cowering
before
a
throng
of
mean
suspicions
of
unavowed
compromises
and
concessions
in
that
moment
of
she
saw
that
sophy
viner
had
chosen
the
better
part
and
that
certain
renunciations
might
enrich
where
possession
would
have
left
a
desert
passionate
reactions
of
instinct
fought
against
these
efforts
of
her
will
why
should
past
or
future
coerce
her
when
the
present
was
so
securely
hers
why
insanely
surrender
what
the
other
would
after
all
never
have
her
sense
of
irony
whispered
that
if
she
sent
away
darrow
it
would
not
be
to
sophy
viner
but
to
the
first
woman
who
crossed
his
path
as
in
a
similar
hour
sophy
viner
herself
had
crossed
it
but
the
mere
fact
that
she
could
think
such
things
of
him
sent
her
shuddering
back
to
the
opposite
pole
she
pictured
herself
gradually
subdued
to
such
a
conception
of
life
and
love
she
pictured
effie
growing
up
under
the
influence
of
the
woman
she
saw
herself
becoming
and
she
hid
her
eyes
from
the
humiliation
of
the
picture
they
were
at
luncheon
when
the
summons
that
darrow
expected
was
brought
to
him
he
handed
the
telegram
to
anna
and
she
learned
that
his
ambassador
on
the
way
to
a
german
cure
was
to
be
in
paris
the
next
evening
and
wished
to
confer
with
him
there
before
he
went
back
to
london
the
idea
that
the
decisive
moment
was
at
hand
was
so
agitating
to
her
that
when
luncheon
was
over
she
slipped
away
to
the
terrace
and
thence
went
down
alone
to
the
garden
the
day
was
grey
but
mild
with
the
heaviness
of
decay
in
the
air
she
rambled
on
aimlessly
following
under
the
denuded
boughs
the
path
she
and
darrow
had
taken
on
their
first
walk
to
the
river
she
was
sure
he
would
not
try
to
overtake
her
sure
he
would
guess
why
she
wished
to
be
alone
there
were
moments
when
it
seemed
to
double
her
loneliness
to
be
so
certain
of
his
reading
her
heart
while
she
was
so
desperately
ignorant
of
his
she
wandered
on
for
more
than
an
hour
and
when
she
returned
to
the
house
she
saw
as
she
entered
the
hall
that
darrow
was
seated
at
the
desk
in
owen
s
study
he
heard
her
step
and
looking
up
turned
in
his
chair
without
rising
their
eyes
met
and
she
saw
that
his
were
clear
and
smiling
he
had
a
heap
of
papers
at
his
elbow
and
was
evidently
engaged
in
some
official
correspondence
she
wondered
that
he
could
address
himself
so
composedly
to
his
task
and
then
ironically
reflected
that
such
detachment
was
a
sign
of
his
superiority
she
crossed
the
threshold
and
went
toward
him
but
as
she
advanced
she
had
a
sudden
vision
of
owen
standing
outside
in
the
cold
autumn
dusk
and
watching
darrow
and
sophy
viner
as
they
faced
each
other
across
the
lamplit
desk
the
evocation
was
so
vivid
that
it
caught
her
breath
like
a
blow
and
she
sank
down
helplessly
on
the
divan
among
the
books
distinctly
at
the
moment
she
understood
that
the
end
had
come
when
he
speaks
to
me
i
will
tell
him
she
thought
darrow
laying
aside
his
pen
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
stood
up
and
shut
the
door
i
must
go
early
he
said
sitting
down
beside
her
his
voice
was
grave
with
a
slight
tinge
of
sadness
she
said
to
herself
he
knows
what
i
am
feeling
and
now
the
thought
made
her
feel
less
alone
the
expression
of
his
face
was
stern
and
yet
tender
for
the
first
time
she
understood
what
he
had
suffered
she
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
necessity
of
giving
him
up
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
him
so
then
she
stood
up
and
said
i
ll
leave
you
to
your
he
made
no
protest
but
merely
answered
you
ll
come
down
presently
for
a
walk
and
it
occurred
to
her
at
once
that
she
would
walk
down
to
the
river
with
him
and
give
herself
for
the
last
time
the
tragic
luxury
of
sitting
at
his
side
in
the
little
pavilion
perhaps
she
thought
it
will
be
easier
to
tell
him
it
did
not
on
the
way
home
from
their
walk
become
any
easier
to
tell
him
but
her
secret
decision
to
do
so
before
he
left
gave
her
a
kind
of
factitious
calm
and
laid
a
melancholy
ecstasy
upon
the
hour
still
skirting
the
subject
that
fanned
their
very
faces
with
its
flame
they
clung
persistently
to
other
topics
and
it
seemed
to
anna
that
their
minds
had
never
been
nearer
together
than
in
this
hour
when
their
hearts
were
so
separate
in
the
glow
of
interchanged
love
she
had
grown
less
conscious
of
that
other
glow
of
interchanged
thought
which
had
once
illumined
her
mind
she
had
forgotten
how
darrow
had
widened
her
world
and
lengthened
out
all
her
perspectives
and
with
a
pang
of
double
destitution
she
saw
herself
alone
among
her
shrunken
thoughts
for
the
first
time
then
she
had
a
clear
vision
of
what
her
life
would
be
without
him
she
imagined
herself
trying
to
take
up
the
daily
round
and
all
that
had
lightened
and
animated
it
seemed
equally
lifeless
and
vain
she
tried
to
think
of
herself
as
wholly
absorbed
in
her
daughter
s
development
like
other
mothers
she
had
seen
but
she
supposed
those
mothers
must
have
had
stored
memories
of
happiness
to
nourish
them
she
had
had
nothing
and
all
her
starved
youth
still
claimed
its
due
when
she
went
up
to
dress
for
dinner
she
said
to
herself
i
ll
have
my
last
evening
with
him
and
then
before
we
say
good
night
i
ll
tell
this
postponement
did
not
seem
unjustified
darrow
had
shown
her
how
he
dreaded
vain
words
how
resolved
he
was
to
avoid
all
fruitless
discussion
he
must
have
been
intensely
aware
of
what
had
been
going
on
in
her
mind
since
his
return
yet
when
she
had
attempted
to
reveal
it
to
him
he
had
turned
from
the
revelation
she
was
therefore
merely
following
the
line
he
had
traced
in
behaving
till
the
final
moment
came
as
though
there
were
nothing
more
to
say
that
moment
seemed
at
last
to
be
at
hand
when
at
her
usual
hour
after
dinner
madame
de
chantelle
rose
to
go
upstairs
she
lingered
a
little
to
bid
to
darrow
whom
she
was
not
likely
to
see
in
the
morning
and
her
affable
allusions
to
his
prompt
return
sounded
in
anna
s
ear
like
the
note
of
destiny
a
cold
rain
had
fallen
all
day
and
for
greater
warmth
and
intimacy
they
had
gone
after
dinner
to
the
shutting
out
the
chilly
vista
of
the
farther
the
autumn
wind
coming
up
from
the
river
cried
about
the
house
with
a
voice
of
loss
and
separation
and
anna
and
darrow
sat
silent
as
if
they
feared
to
break
the
hush
that
shut
them
in
the
solitude
the
the
harmony
of
soft
hangings
and
old
dim
pictures
wove
about
them
a
spell
of
security
through
which
anna
felt
far
down
in
her
heart
the
muffled
beat
of
an
inextinguishable
bliss
how
could
she
have
thought
that
this
last
moment
would
be
the
moment
to
speak
to
him
when
it
seemed
to
have
gathered
up
into
its
flight
all
the
scattered
splendours
of
her
dream
xxxvi
darrow
continued
to
stand
by
the
door
after
it
had
closed
anna
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
her
and
sat
still
disdaining
to
seek
refuge
in
any
evasive
word
or
movement
for
the
last
time
she
wanted
to
let
him
take
from
her
the
fulness
of
what
the
sight
of
her
could
give
he
crossed
over
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
spoke
then
he
said
dearest
i
must
have
my
she
straightened
herself
under
the
shock
of
his
seeming
to
take
the
very
words
from
her
lips
was
all
that
she
could
falter
i
must
be
off
by
the
early
train
there
won
t
be
more
than
a
moment
in
the
he
had
taken
her
hand
and
she
said
to
herself
that
she
must
free
it
before
she
could
go
on
with
what
she
had
to
say
then
she
rejected
this
concession
to
a
weakness
she
was
resolved
to
defy
to
the
end
she
would
leave
her
hand
in
his
hand
her
eyes
in
his
eyes
she
would
not
in
their
final
hour
together
be
afraid
of
any
part
of
her
love
for
him
you
ll
tell
me
dear
he
insisted
gently
and
his
insistence
gave
her
the
strength
to
speak
there
s
something
i
must
ask
you
she
broke
out
perceiving
as
she
heard
her
words
that
they
were
not
in
the
least
what
she
had
meant
to
say
he
sat
still
waiting
and
she
pressed
on
do
such
things
happen
to
men
often
the
quiet
room
seemed
to
resound
with
the
long
reverberations
of
her
question
she
looked
away
from
him
and
he
released
her
and
stood
up
i
don
t
know
what
happens
to
other
men
such
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
his
face
she
felt
like
a
traveller
on
a
giddy
path
between
a
cliff
and
a
precipice
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
go
on
had
it
had
it
begun
before
you
met
her
in
paris
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
ve
told
you
the
facts
as
they
all
the
facts
he
turned
abruptly
what
do
you
mean
her
throat
was
dry
and
the
loud
pulses
drummed
in
her
temples
i
mean
about
her
perhaps
you
knew
knew
things
about
her
she
stopped
the
room
had
grown
profoundly
still
a
log
dropped
to
the
hearth
and
broke
there
in
a
hissing
shower
darrow
spoke
in
a
clear
voice
i
knew
nothing
absolutely
nothing
he
said
she
had
the
answer
to
her
inmost
doubt
to
her
last
shameful
unavowed
hope
she
sat
powerless
under
her
woe
he
walked
to
the
fireplace
and
pushed
back
the
broken
log
with
his
foot
a
flame
shot
out
of
it
and
in
the
upward
glare
she
saw
his
pale
face
stern
with
misery
is
that
all
he
asked
she
made
a
slight
sign
with
her
head
and
he
came
slowly
back
to
her
then
is
this
to
be
again
she
signed
a
faint
assent
and
he
made
no
effort
to
touch
her
or
draw
nearer
you
understand
that
i
sha
n
t
come
back
he
was
looking
at
her
and
she
tried
to
return
his
look
but
her
eyes
were
blind
with
tears
and
in
dread
of
his
seeing
them
she
got
up
and
walked
away
he
did
not
follow
her
and
she
stood
with
her
back
to
him
staring
at
a
bowl
of
carnations
on
a
little
table
strewn
with
books
her
tears
magnified
everything
she
looked
at
and
the
streaked
petals
of
the
carnations
their
fringed
edges
and
frail
curled
stamens
pressed
upon
her
huge
and
vivid
she
noticed
among
the
books
a
volume
of
verse
he
had
sent
her
from
england
and
tried
to
remember
whether
it
was
before
or
after
she
felt
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
speak
and
at
last
she
turned
to
him
i
shall
see
you
before
you
go
he
made
no
answer
she
moved
toward
the
door
and
he
held
it
open
for
her
she
saw
his
hand
on
the
door
and
his
seal
ring
in
its
setting
of
twisted
silver
and
the
sense
of
the
end
of
all
things
came
to
her
they
walked
down
the
between
the
shadowy
reflections
of
screens
and
cabinets
and
mounted
the
stairs
side
by
side
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
a
lamp
brought
out
turbid
gleams
in
the
smoky
above
it
on
the
landing
darrow
stopped
his
room
was
the
nearest
to
the
stairs
good
night
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
as
anna
gave
him
hers
the
springs
of
grief
broke
loose
in
her
she
struggled
with
her
sobs
and
subdued
them
but
her
breath
came
unevenly
and
to
hide
her
agitation
she
leaned
on
him
and
pressed
her
face
against
his
arm
don
t
don
t
he
whispered
soothing
her
her
troubled
breathing
sounded
loudly
in
the
silence
of
the
sleeping
house
she
pressed
her
lips
tight
but
could
not
stop
the
nervous
pulsations
in
her
throat
and
he
put
an
arm
about
her
and
opening
his
door
drew
her
across
the
threshold
of
his
room
the
door
shut
behind
her
and
she
sat
down
on
the
lounge
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
pulsations
in
her
throat
had
ceased
but
she
knew
they
would
begin
again
if
she
tried
to
speak
darrow
walked
away
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
the
lamp
shone
on
his
books
and
papers
on
the
by
the
fire
and
the
scattered
objects
on
his
a
log
glimmered
on
the
hearth
and
the
room
was
warm
and
faintly
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
been
in
a
room
he
lived
in
among
his
personal
possessions
and
the
traces
of
his
daily
usage
every
object
about
her
seemed
to
contain
a
particle
of
himself
the
whole
air
breathed
of
him
steeping
her
in
the
sense
of
his
intimate
presence
suddenly
she
thought
this
is
what
sophy
viner
knew
and
with
a
torturing
precision
she
pictured
them
alone
in
such
a
scene
had
he
taken
the
girl
to
an
hotel
where
did
people
go
in
such
cases
wherever
they
were
the
silence
of
night
had
been
around
them
and
the
things
he
used
had
been
strewn
about
the
room
anna
ashamed
of
dwelling
on
the
detested
vision
stood
up
with
a
confused
impulse
of
flight
then
a
wave
of
contrary
feeling
arrested
her
and
she
paused
with
lowered
head
darrow
had
come
forward
as
she
rose
and
she
perceived
that
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
bid
him
good
night
it
was
clear
that
no
other
possibility
had
even
brushed
his
mind
and
the
fact
for
some
dim
reason
humiliated
her
why
not
why
not
something
whispered
in
her
as
though
his
forbearance
his
tacit
recognition
of
her
pride
were
a
slight
on
other
qualities
she
wanted
him
to
feel
in
her
in
the
morning
then
she
heard
him
say
yes
in
the
morning
she
repeated
she
continued
to
stand
in
the
same
place
looking
vaguely
about
the
room
for
once
before
they
parted
since
part
they
must
she
longed
to
be
to
him
all
that
sophy
viner
had
been
but
she
remained
rooted
to
the
floor
unable
to
find
a
word
or
imagine
a
gesture
that
should
express
her
meaning
exasperated
by
her
helplessness
she
thought
don
t
i
feel
things
as
other
women
do
her
eye
fell
on
a
she
had
given
him
it
was
worn
at
the
corners
with
the
friction
of
his
pocket
and
distended
with
thickly
packed
papers
she
wondered
if
he
carried
her
letters
in
it
and
she
put
her
hand
out
and
touched
it
all
that
he
and
she
had
ever
felt
or
seen
their
close
encounters
of
word
and
look
and
the
closer
contact
of
their
silences
trembled
through
her
at
the
touch
she
remembered
things
he
had
said
that
had
been
like
new
skies
above
her
head
ways
he
had
that
seemed
a
part
of
the
air
she
breathed
the
faint
warmth
of
her
girlish
love
came
back
to
her
gathering
heat
as
it
passed
through
her
thoughts
and
her
heart
rocked
like
a
boat
on
the
surge
of
its
long
long
memories
it
s
because
i
love
him
in
too
many
ways
she
thought
and
slowly
she
turned
to
the
door
she
was
aware
that
darrow
was
still
silently
watching
her
but
he
neither
stirred
nor
spoke
till
she
had
reached
the
threshold
then
he
met
her
there
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
not
don
t
tell
me
he
whispered
and
she
leaned
away
from
him
closing
her
eyes
for
an
instant
and
then
slowly
opening
them
to
the
flood
of
light
in
his
xxxvii
anna
and
darrow
the
next
day
sat
alone
in
a
compartment
of
the
paris
train
anna
when
they
entered
it
had
put
herself
in
the
farthest
corner
and
placed
her
bag
on
the
adjoining
seat
she
had
decided
suddenly
to
accompany
darrow
to
paris
had
even
persuaded
him
to
wait
for
a
later
train
in
order
that
they
might
travel
together
she
had
an
intense
longing
to
be
with
him
an
almost
morbid
terror
of
losing
sight
of
him
for
a
moment
when
he
jumped
out
of
the
train
and
ran
back
along
the
platform
to
buy
a
newspaper
for
her
she
felt
as
though
she
should
never
see
him
again
and
shivered
with
the
cold
misery
of
her
last
journey
to
paris
when
she
had
thought
herself
parted
from
him
forever
yet
she
wanted
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
on
the
other
side
of
the
compartment
and
as
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
she
drew
from
her
bag
the
letters
she
had
thrust
in
it
as
she
left
the
house
and
began
to
glance
over
them
so
that
her
lowered
lids
should
hide
her
eyes
from
him
she
was
his
now
his
for
life
there
could
never
again
be
any
question
of
sacrificing
herself
to
effie
s
welfare
or
to
any
other
abstract
conception
of
duty
effie
of
course
would
not
suffer
anna
would
pay
for
her
bliss
as
a
wife
by
redoubled
devotion
as
a
mother
her
scruples
were
not
overcome
but
for
the
time
their
voices
were
drowned
in
the
tumultuous
rumour
of
her
happiness
as
she
opened
her
letters
she
was
conscious
that
darrow
s
gaze
was
fixed
on
her
and
gradually
it
drew
her
eyes
upward
and
she
drank
deep
of
the
passionate
tenderness
in
his
then
the
blood
rose
to
her
face
and
she
felt
again
the
desire
to
shield
herself
she
turned
back
to
her
letters
and
her
glance
lit
on
an
envelope
inscribed
in
owen
s
hand
her
heart
began
to
beat
oppressively
she
was
in
a
mood
when
the
simplest
things
seemed
ominous
what
could
owen
have
to
say
to
her
only
the
first
page
was
covered
and
it
contained
simply
the
announcement
that
in
the
company
of
a
young
compatriot
who
was
studying
at
the
beaux
arts
he
had
planned
to
leave
for
spain
the
following
evening
he
hasn
t
seen
her
then
was
anna
s
instant
thought
and
her
feeling
was
a
strange
compound
of
humiliation
and
relief
the
girl
had
kept
her
word
lived
up
to
the
line
of
conduct
she
had
set
herself
and
anna
had
failed
in
the
same
attempt
she
did
not
reproach
herself
with
her
failure
but
she
would
have
been
happier
if
there
had
been
less
discrepancy
between
her
words
to
sophy
viner
and
the
act
which
had
followed
them
it
irritated
her
obscurely
that
the
girl
should
have
been
so
much
surer
of
her
power
to
carry
out
her
purpose
anna
looked
up
and
saw
that
darrow
s
eyes
were
on
the
newspaper
he
seemed
calm
and
secure
almost
indifferent
to
her
presence
will
it
become
a
matter
of
course
to
him
so
soon
she
wondered
with
a
twinge
of
jealousy
she
sat
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
trying
to
make
him
feel
the
attraction
of
her
gaze
as
she
felt
his
it
surprised
and
shamed
her
to
detect
a
new
element
in
her
love
for
him
a
sort
of
suspicious
tyrannical
tenderness
that
seemed
to
deprive
it
of
all
serenity
finally
he
looked
up
his
smile
enveloped
her
and
she
felt
herself
his
in
every
fibre
his
so
completely
and
inseparably
that
she
saw
the
vanity
of
imagining
any
other
fate
for
herself
to
give
herself
a
countenance
she
held
out
owen
s
letter
he
took
it
and
glanced
down
the
page
his
face
grown
grave
she
waited
nervously
till
he
looked
up
that
s
a
good
plan
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
he
said
a
just
perceptible
shade
of
constraint
in
his
tone
oh
yes
she
hastily
assented
she
was
aware
of
a
faint
current
of
relief
silently
circulating
between
them
they
were
both
glad
that
owen
was
going
that
for
a
while
he
would
be
out
of
their
way
and
it
seemed
to
her
horrible
that
so
much
of
the
stuff
of
their
happiness
should
be
made
of
such
unavowed
feelings
i
shall
see
him
this
evening
she
said
wishing
darrow
to
feel
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
meeting
her
yes
of
course
perhaps
he
might
dine
with
the
words
struck
her
as
strangely
obtuse
darrow
was
to
meet
his
ambassador
at
the
station
on
the
latter
s
arrival
and
would
in
all
probability
have
to
spend
the
evening
with
him
and
anna
knew
he
had
been
concerned
at
the
thought
of
having
to
leave
her
alone
but
how
could
he
speak
in
that
careless
tone
of
her
dining
with
owen
she
lowered
her
voice
to
say
i
m
afraid
he
s
desperately
he
answered
with
a
tinge
of
impatience
it
s
much
the
best
thing
that
he
should
yes
but
don
t
you
feel
she
broke
off
she
knew
how
he
disliked
these
idle
returns
on
the
irrevocable
and
her
fear
of
doing
or
saying
what
he
disliked
was
tinged
by
a
new
instinct
of
subserviency
against
which
her
pride
revolted
she
thought
to
herself
he
will
see
the
change
and
grow
indifferent
to
me
as
he
did
to
her
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
reliving
the
experience
of
sophy
viner
darrow
made
no
attempt
to
learn
the
end
of
her
unfinished
sentence
he
handed
back
owen
s
letter
and
returned
to
his
newspaper
and
when
he
looked
up
from
it
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
with
a
clear
brow
and
a
smile
that
irresistibly
drew
her
back
to
happier
thoughts
the
train
was
just
entering
a
station
and
a
moment
later
their
compartment
was
invaded
by
a
commonplace
couple
preoccupied
with
the
bestowal
of
bulging
packages
anna
at
their
approach
felt
the
possessive
pride
of
the
woman
in
love
when
strangers
are
between
herself
and
the
man
she
loves
she
asked
darrow
to
open
the
window
to
place
her
bag
in
the
net
to
roll
her
rug
into
a
cushion
for
her
feet
and
while
he
was
thus
busied
with
her
she
was
conscious
of
a
new
devotion
in
his
tone
in
his
way
of
bending
over
her
and
meeting
her
eyes
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
they
looked
at
each
other
like
lovers
smiling
at
a
happy
secret
anna
before
going
back
to
givre
had
suggested
owen
s
moving
into
her
apartment
but
he
had
preferred
to
remain
at
the
hotel
to
which
he
had
sent
his
luggage
and
on
arriving
in
paris
she
decided
to
drive
there
at
once
she
was
impatient
to
have
the
meeting
over
and
glad
that
darrow
was
obliged
to
leave
her
at
the
station
in
order
to
look
up
a
colleague
at
the
embassy
she
dreaded
his
seeing
owen
again
and
yet
dared
not
tell
him
so
and
to
ensure
his
remaining
away
she
mentioned
an
urgent
engagement
with
her
and
a
long
list
of
commissions
to
be
executed
for
madame
de
chantelle
i
shall
see
you
morning
she
said
but
he
replied
with
a
smile
that
he
would
certainly
find
time
to
come
to
her
for
a
moment
on
his
way
back
from
meeting
the
ambassador
and
when
he
had
put
her
in
a
cab
he
leaned
through
the
window
to
press
his
lips
to
hers
she
blushed
like
a
girl
thinking
half
vexed
half
happy
yesterday
he
would
not
have
done
it
and
a
dozen
scarcely
definable
differences
in
his
look
and
manner
seemed
all
at
once
to
be
summed
up
in
the
boyish
act
after
all
i
m
engaged
to
him
she
reflected
and
then
smiled
at
the
absurdity
of
the
word
the
next
instant
with
a
pang
of
she
remembered
sophy
viner
s
cry
i
knew
all
the
while
he
didn
t
care
poor
thing
oh
poor
thing
anna
murmured
at
owen
s
hotel
she
waited
in
a
tremor
while
the
porter
went
in
search
of
him
word
was
presently
brought
back
that
he
was
in
his
room
and
begged
her
to
come
up
and
as
she
crossed
the
hall
she
caught
sight
of
his
portmanteaux
lying
on
the
floor
already
labelled
for
departure
owen
sat
at
a
table
writing
his
back
to
the
door
and
when
he
stood
up
the
window
was
behind
him
so
that
in
the
rainy
afternoon
light
his
features
were
barely
discernible
dearest
so
you
re
really
off
she
said
hesitating
a
moment
on
the
threshold
he
pushed
a
chair
forward
and
they
sat
down
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
finally
she
put
some
random
question
about
his
a
slow
shy
meditative
youth
whom
he
had
once
or
twice
brought
down
to
givre
she
reflected
that
it
was
natural
he
should
have
given
this
uncommunicative
comrade
the
preference
over
his
livelier
acquaintances
and
aloud
she
said
i
m
so
glad
fred
rempson
can
go
with
owen
answered
in
the
same
tone
and
for
a
few
minutes
their
talk
dragged
itself
on
over
a
dry
waste
of
anna
noticed
that
though
ready
enough
to
impart
his
own
plans
owen
studiously
abstained
from
putting
any
questions
about
hers
it
was
evident
from
his
allusions
that
he
meant
to
be
away
for
some
time
and
he
presently
asked
her
if
she
would
give
instructions
about
packing
and
sending
after
him
some
winter
clothes
he
had
left
at
givre
this
gave
her
the
opportunity
to
say
that
she
expected
to
go
back
within
a
day
or
two
and
would
attend
to
the
matter
as
soon
as
she
returned
she
added
i
came
up
this
morning
with
george
who
is
going
on
to
london
intending
by
the
use
of
darrow
s
christian
name
to
give
owen
the
chance
to
speak
of
her
marriage
but
he
made
no
comment
and
she
continued
to
hear
the
name
sounding
on
unfamiliarly
between
them
the
room
was
almost
dark
and
she
finally
stood
up
and
glanced
about
for
the
saying
i
can
t
see
you
oh
don
t
i
hate
the
light
owen
exclaimed
catching
her
by
the
wrist
and
pushing
her
back
into
her
seat
he
gave
a
nervous
laugh
and
added
i
m
with
neuralgia
i
suppose
it
s
this
beastly
yes
it
will
do
you
good
to
get
down
to
she
asked
if
he
had
the
remedies
the
doctor
had
given
him
for
a
previous
attack
and
on
his
replying
that
he
didn
t
know
what
he
d
done
with
the
stuff
she
sprang
up
offering
to
go
to
the
chemist
s
it
was
a
relief
to
have
something
to
do
for
him
and
she
knew
from
his
oh
thanks
would
you
that
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
have
a
pretext
for
not
detaining
her
his
natural
impulse
would
have
been
to
declare
that
he
didn
t
want
any
drugs
and
would
be
all
right
in
no
time
and
his
acquiescence
showed
her
how
profoundly
he
felt
the
uselessness
of
their
trying
to
prolong
their
talk
his
face
was
now
no
more
than
a
white
blur
in
the
dusk
but
she
felt
its
indistinctness
as
a
veil
drawn
over
aching
intensities
of
expression
he
knows
he
knows
she
said
to
herself
and
wondered
whether
the
truth
had
been
revealed
to
him
by
some
corroborative
fact
or
by
the
sheer
force
of
divination
he
had
risen
also
and
was
clearly
waiting
for
her
to
go
and
she
turned
to
the
door
saying
i
ll
be
back
in
a
oh
don
t
come
up
again
please
he
paused
embarrassed
i
mean
i
may
not
be
here
i
ve
got
to
go
and
pick
up
rempson
and
see
about
some
final
things
with
she
stopped
on
the
threshold
with
a
sinking
heart
he
meant
this
to
be
their
then
and
he
had
not
even
asked
her
when
she
was
to
be
married
or
spoken
of
seeing
her
again
before
she
set
out
for
the
other
side
of
the
world
owen
she
cried
and
turned
back
he
stood
mutely
before
her
in
the
dimness
you
haven
t
told
me
how
long
you
re
to
be
how
long
oh
you
see
that
s
rather
vague
i
hate
definite
dates
you
know
he
paused
and
she
saw
he
did
not
mean
to
help
her
out
she
tried
to
say
you
ll
be
here
for
my
wedding
but
could
not
bring
the
words
to
her
lips
instead
she
murmured
in
six
weeks
i
shall
be
going
too
and
he
rejoined
as
if
he
had
expected
the
announcement
and
prepared
his
answer
oh
by
that
time
very
likely
at
any
rate
i
won
t
say
she
stammered
feeling
the
tears
beneath
her
veil
no
no
rather
not
he
declared
but
he
made
no
movement
and
she
went
up
and
threw
her
arms
about
him
you
ll
write
me
won
t
you
of
course
of
course
her
hands
slipped
down
into
his
and
for
a
minute
they
held
each
other
dumbly
in
the
darkness
then
he
gave
a
vague
laugh
and
said
it
s
really
time
to
light
he
pressed
the
electric
button
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
opened
the
door
and
she
passed
out
without
daring
to
turn
back
lest
the
light
on
his
face
should
show
her
what
she
feared
to
see
xxxviii
anna
drove
to
the
chemist
s
for
owen
s
remedy
on
the
way
she
stopped
her
cab
at
a
and
emerged
from
it
laden
with
literature
she
knew
what
would
interest
owen
and
what
he
was
likely
to
have
read
and
she
had
made
her
choice
among
the
newest
publications
with
the
promptness
of
a
discriminating
reader
but
on
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
she
was
overcome
by
the
irony
of
adding
this
mental
panacea
to
the
other
there
was
something
grotesque
and
almost
mocking
in
the
idea
of
offering
a
judicious
selection
of
literature
to
a
man
setting
out
on
such
a
journey
he
knows
he
knows
she
kept
on
repeating
and
giving
the
porter
the
parcel
from
the
chemist
s
she
drove
away
without
leaving
the
books
she
went
to
her
apartment
whither
her
maid
had
preceded
her
there
was
a
fire
in
the
and
the
stood
ready
by
the
hearth
the
stormy
rain
beat
against
the
uncurtained
windows
and
she
thought
of
owen
who
would
soon
be
driving
through
it
to
the
station
alone
with
his
bitter
thoughts
she
had
been
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
had
always
sought
her
help
in
difficult
hours
and
now
in
the
most
difficult
of
all
she
was
the
one
being
to
whom
he
could
not
turn
between
them
henceforth
there
would
always
be
the
wall
of
an
insurmountable
silence
she
strained
her
aching
thoughts
to
guess
how
the
truth
had
come
to
him
had
he
seen
the
girl
and
had
she
told
him
instinctively
anna
rejected
this
conjecture
but
what
need
was
there
of
assuming
an
explicit
statement
when
every
breath
they
had
drawn
for
the
last
weeks
had
been
charged
with
the
immanent
secret
as
she
looked
back
over
the
days
since
darrow
s
first
arrival
at
givre
she
perceived
that
at
no
time
had
any
one
deliberately
spoken
or
anything
been
accidentally
disclosed
the
truth
had
come
to
light
by
the
force
of
its
irresistible
pressure
and
the
perception
gave
her
a
startled
sense
of
hidden
powers
of
a
chaos
of
attractions
and
repulsions
far
beneath
the
ordered
surfaces
of
intercourse
she
looked
back
with
melancholy
derision
on
her
old
conception
of
life
as
a
kind
of
and
well
policed
suburb
to
dark
places
one
need
never
know
about
here
they
were
these
dark
places
in
her
own
bosom
and
henceforth
she
would
always
have
to
traverse
them
to
reach
the
beings
she
loved
best
she
was
still
sitting
beside
the
untouched
when
she
heard
darrow
s
voice
in
the
hall
she
started
up
saying
to
herself
i
must
tell
him
that
owen
knows
but
when
the
door
opened
and
she
saw
his
face
still
lit
by
the
same
smile
of
boyish
triumph
she
felt
anew
the
uselessness
of
speaking
had
he
ever
supposed
that
owen
would
not
know
probably
from
the
height
of
his
greater
experience
he
had
seen
long
since
that
all
that
happened
was
inevitable
and
the
thought
of
it
at
any
rate
was
clearly
not
weighing
on
him
now
he
was
already
dressed
for
the
evening
and
as
he
came
toward
her
he
said
the
ambassador
s
booked
for
an
official
dinner
and
i
m
free
after
all
where
shall
we
dine
anna
had
pictured
herself
sitting
alone
all
the
evening
with
her
wretched
thoughts
and
the
fact
of
having
to
put
them
out
of
her
mind
for
the
next
few
hours
gave
her
an
immediate
sensation
of
relief
already
her
pulses
were
dancing
to
the
tune
of
darrow
s
and
as
they
smiled
at
each
other
she
thought
nothing
can
ever
change
the
fact
that
i
belong
to
where
shall
we
dine
he
repeated
gaily
and
she
named
a
restaurant
for
which
she
had
once
heard
him
express
a
preference
but
as
she
did
so
she
fancied
she
saw
a
shadow
on
his
face
and
instantly
she
said
to
herself
it
was
there
he
went
with
her
oh
no
not
there
after
all
she
interrupted
herself
and
now
she
was
sure
his
colour
deepened
where
shall
it
be
then
she
noticed
that
he
did
not
ask
the
reason
of
her
change
and
this
convinced
her
that
she
had
guessed
the
truth
and
that
he
knew
she
had
guessed
it
he
will
always
know
what
i
am
thinking
and
he
will
never
dare
to
ask
me
she
thought
and
she
saw
between
them
the
same
insurmountable
wall
of
silence
as
between
herself
and
owen
a
wall
of
glass
through
which
they
could
watch
each
other
s
faintest
motions
but
which
no
sound
could
ever
traverse
they
drove
to
a
restaurant
on
the
boulevard
and
there
in
their
intimate
corner
of
the
serried
scene
the
sense
of
what
was
unspoken
between
them
gradually
ceased
to
oppress
her
he
looked
so
and
handsome
so
ingenuously
proud
of
her
so
openly
happy
at
being
with
her
that
no
other
fact
could
seem
real
in
his
presence
he
had
learned
that
the
ambassador
was
to
spend
two
days
in
paris
and
he
had
reason
to
hope
that
in
consequence
his
own
departure
for
london
would
be
deferred
he
was
exhilarated
by
the
prospect
of
being
with
anna
for
a
few
hours
longer
and
she
did
not
ask
herself
if
his
exhilaration
were
a
sign
of
insensibility
for
she
was
too
conscious
of
his
power
of
swaying
her
moods
not
to
be
secretly
proud
of
affecting
his
they
lingered
for
some
time
over
the
fruit
and
coffee
and
when
they
rose
to
go
darrow
suggested
that
if
she
felt
disposed
for
the
play
they
were
not
too
late
for
the
second
part
of
the
programme
at
one
of
the
smaller
theatres
his
mention
of
the
hour
recalled
owen
to
her
thoughts
she
saw
his
train
rushing
southward
through
the
storm
and
in
a
corner
of
the
swaying
compartment
his
face
white
and
indistinct
as
it
had
loomed
on
her
in
the
rainy
twilight
it
was
horrible
to
be
thus
perpetually
paying
for
her
happiness
darrow
had
called
for
a
theatrical
journal
and
he
presently
looked
up
from
it
to
say
i
hear
the
second
play
at
the
athenee
is
it
was
on
anna
s
lips
to
acquiesce
but
as
she
was
about
to
speak
she
wondered
if
it
were
not
at
the
athenee
that
owen
had
seen
darrow
with
sophy
viner
she
was
not
sure
he
had
even
mentioned
the
theatre
but
the
mere
possibility
was
enough
to
darken
her
sky
it
was
hateful
to
her
to
think
of
accompanying
darrow
to
places
where
the
girl
had
been
with
him
she
tried
to
reason
away
this
scruple
she
even
reminded
herself
with
a
bitter
irony
that
whenever
she
was
in
darrow
s
arms
she
was
where
the
girl
had
been
before
her
but
she
could
not
shake
off
her
superstitious
dread
of
being
with
him
in
any
of
the
scenes
of
the
parisian
episode
she
replied
that
she
was
too
tired
for
the
play
and
they
drove
back
to
her
apartment
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
to
wish
him
good
night
but
he
appeared
not
to
notice
her
gesture
and
followed
her
up
to
her
door
this
is
ever
so
much
better
than
the
theatre
he
said
as
they
entered
the
she
had
crossed
the
room
and
was
bending
over
the
hearth
to
light
the
fire
she
knew
he
was
approaching
her
and
that
in
a
moment
he
would
have
drawn
the
cloak
from
her
shoulders
and
laid
his
lips
on
her
neck
just
below
the
hair
these
privileges
were
his
and
however
deferently
and
tenderly
he
claimed
them
the
joyous
ease
of
his
manner
marked
a
difference
and
proclaimed
a
right
after
the
theatre
they
came
home
like
this
she
thought
and
at
the
same
instant
she
felt
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
shrank
back
don
t
oh
don
t
she
cried
drawing
her
cloak
about
her
she
saw
from
his
astonished
stare
that
her
face
must
be
quivering
with
pain
anna
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
owen
knows
she
broke
out
with
a
confused
desire
to
justify
herself
darrow
s
countenance
changed
did
he
tell
you
so
what
did
he
say
nothing
i
knew
it
from
the
things
he
didn
t
you
had
a
talk
with
him
this
afternoon
yes
for
a
few
minutes
i
could
see
he
didn
t
want
me
to
she
had
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
there
huddled
still
holding
her
cloak
about
her
shoulders
darrow
did
not
dispute
her
assumption
and
she
noticed
that
he
expressed
no
surprise
he
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
from
her
turning
about
in
his
fingers
the
he
had
drawn
out
as
they
came
in
at
length
he
said
had
he
seen
miss
viner
she
shrank
from
the
sound
of
the
name
no
i
don
t
think
so
i
m
sure
he
hadn
t
they
remained
silent
looking
away
from
one
another
finally
darrow
stood
up
and
took
a
few
steps
across
the
room
he
came
back
and
paused
before
her
his
eyes
on
her
face
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
to
she
raised
her
head
and
gave
him
back
his
look
nothing
i
do
can
help
owen
no
but
things
can
t
go
on
like
he
paused
as
if
to
measure
his
words
i
fill
you
with
aversion
he
exclaimed
she
started
up
no
oh
no
poor
child
you
can
t
see
your
face
she
lifted
her
hands
as
if
to
hide
it
and
turning
away
from
him
bowed
her
head
upon
the
she
felt
that
he
was
standing
a
little
way
behind
her
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
touch
her
or
come
nearer
i
know
you
ve
felt
as
i
ve
felt
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that
we
belong
to
each
other
and
that
nothing
can
alter
that
but
other
thoughts
come
and
you
can
t
banish
them
whenever
you
see
me
you
remember
you
associate
me
with
things
you
abhor
you
ve
been
generous
immeasurably
you
ve
given
me
all
the
chances
a
woman
could
but
if
it
s
only
made
you
suffer
what
s
the
use
she
turned
to
him
with
a
face
it
hasn
t
only
done
oh
no
i
know
there
ve
been
moments
he
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
they
ll
be
with
me
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
can
t
see
you
paying
such
a
price
for
them
i
m
not
worth
what
i
m
costing
she
continued
to
gaze
at
him
through
eyes
and
suddenly
she
flung
out
the
question
wasn
t
it
the
athenee
you
took
her
to
that
evening
anna
anna
yes
i
want
to
know
now
to
know
everything
perhaps
that
will
make
me
forget
i
ought
to
have
made
you
tell
me
before
wherever
we
go
i
imagine
you
ve
been
there
with
her
i
see
you
together
i
want
to
know
how
it
began
where
you
went
why
you
left
her
i
can
t
go
on
in
this
darkness
any
longer
she
did
not
know
what
had
prompted
her
passionate
outburst
but
already
she
felt
lighter
freer
as
if
at
last
the
evil
spell
were
broken
i
want
to
know
everything
she
repeated
it
s
the
only
way
to
make
me
after
she
had
ceased
speaking
darrow
remained
where
he
was
his
arms
folded
his
eyes
lowered
immovable
she
waited
her
gaze
on
his
face
aren
t
you
going
to
tell
me
the
blood
rushed
to
her
temples
you
won
t
why
not
if
i
did
do
you
suppose
you
d
forget
that
oh
she
moaned
and
turned
away
from
him
you
see
it
s
impossible
he
went
on
i
ve
done
a
thing
i
loathe
and
to
atone
for
it
you
ask
me
to
do
another
what
sort
of
satisfaction
would
that
give
you
it
would
put
something
irremediable
between
she
leaned
her
elbow
against
the
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
she
had
the
sense
that
she
was
vainly
throwing
away
her
last
hope
of
happiness
yet
she
could
do
nothing
think
of
nothing
to
save
it
the
conjecture
flashed
through
her
should
i
be
at
peace
if
i
gave
him
up
and
she
remembered
the
desolation
of
the
days
after
she
had
sent
him
away
and
understood
that
that
hope
was
vain
the
tears
welled
through
her
lids
and
ran
slowly
down
between
her
fingers
she
heard
him
say
and
his
footsteps
turned
to
the
door
she
tried
to
raise
her
head
but
the
weight
of
her
despair
bowed
it
down
she
said
to
herself
this
is
the
end
he
won
t
try
to
appeal
to
me
again
and
she
remained
in
a
sort
of
tranced
rigidity
perceiving
without
feeling
the
fateful
lapse
of
the
seconds
then
the
cords
that
bound
her
seemed
to
snap
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
saw
him
going
why
he
s
mine
he
s
mine
he
s
no
one
else
s
his
face
was
turned
to
her
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
swept
away
all
her
terrors
she
no
longer
understood
what
had
prompted
her
senseless
outcry
and
the
mortal
sweetness
of
loving
him
became
again
the
one
real
fact
in
the
world
xxxix
anna
the
next
day
woke
to
a
humiliated
memory
of
the
previous
evening
darrow
had
been
right
in
saying
that
their
sacrifice
would
benefit
no
one
yet
she
seemed
dimly
to
discern
that
there
were
obligations
not
to
be
tested
by
that
standard
she
owed
it
at
any
rate
as
much
to
his
pride
as
to
hers
to
abstain
from
the
repetition
of
such
scenes
and
she
had
learned
that
it
was
beyond
her
power
to
do
so
while
they
were
together
yet
when
he
had
given
her
the
chance
to
free
herself
everything
had
vanished
from
her
mind
but
the
blind
fear
of
losing
him
and
she
saw
that
he
and
she
were
as
profoundly
and
inextricably
bound
together
as
two
trees
with
interwoven
roots
for
a
long
time
she
brooded
on
her
plight
vaguely
conscious
that
the
only
escape
from
it
must
come
from
some
external
chance
and
slowly
the
occasion
shaped
itself
in
her
mind
it
was
sophy
viner
only
who
could
save
her
sophy
viner
only
who
could
give
her
back
her
lost
serenity
she
would
seek
the
girl
out
and
tell
her
that
she
had
given
darrow
up
and
that
step
once
taken
there
would
be
no
retracing
it
and
she
would
perforce
have
to
go
forward
alone
any
pretext
for
action
was
a
kind
of
anodyne
and
she
despatched
her
maid
to
the
farlows
with
a
note
asking
if
miss
viner
would
receive
her
there
was
a
long
delay
before
the
maid
returned
and
when
at
last
she
appeared
it
was
with
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
an
address
was
written
and
a
verbal
message
to
the
effect
that
miss
viner
had
left
some
days
previously
and
was
staying
with
her
sister
in
a
hotel
near
the
place
de
l
etoile
the
maid
added
that
farlow
on
the
plea
that
miss
viner
s
plans
were
uncertain
had
at
first
made
some
difficulty
about
giving
this
information
and
anna
guessed
that
the
girl
had
left
her
friends
roof
and
instructed
them
to
withhold
her
address
with
the
object
of
avoiding
owen
she
s
kept
faith
with
herself
and
i
haven
t
anna
mused
and
the
thought
was
a
fresh
incentive
to
action
darrow
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
soon
after
luncheon
and
the
morning
was
already
so
far
advanced
that
anna
still
mistrustful
of
her
strength
decided
to
drive
immediately
to
the
address
farlow
had
given
on
the
way
there
she
tried
to
recall
what
she
had
heard
of
sophy
viner
s
sister
but
beyond
the
girl
s
enthusiastic
report
of
the
absent
laura
s
loveliness
she
could
remember
only
certain
vague
allusions
of
farlow
s
to
her
artistic
endowments
and
matrimonial
vicissitudes
darrow
had
mentioned
her
but
once
and
in
the
briefest
terms
as
having
apparently
very
little
concern
for
sophy
s
welfare
and
being
at
any
rate
too
geographically
remote
to
give
her
any
practical
support
and
anna
wondered
what
chance
had
brought
her
to
her
sister
s
side
at
this
conjunction
farlow
had
spoken
of
her
as
a
celebrity
in
what
line
anna
failed
to
recall
but
farlow
s
celebrities
were
legion
and
the
name
on
the
slip
of
paper
did
not
seem
to
have
any
definite
association
with
fame
while
anna
waited
in
the
dingy
vestibule
of
the
hotel
chicago
she
had
so
distinct
a
vision
of
what
she
meant
to
say
to
sophy
viner
that
the
girl
seemed
already
to
be
before
her
and
her
heart
dropped
from
all
the
height
of
its
courage
when
the
porter
after
a
long
delay
returned
with
the
announcement
that
miss
viner
was
no
longer
in
the
hotel
anna
doubtful
if
she
understood
asked
if
he
merely
meant
that
the
young
lady
was
out
at
the
moment
but
he
replied
that
she
had
gone
away
the
day
before
beyond
this
he
had
no
information
to
impart
and
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
anna
sent
him
back
to
enquire
if
would
receive
her
she
reflected
that
sophy
had
probably
pledged
her
sister
to
the
same
secrecy
as
farlow
and
that
a
personal
appeal
to
birch
might
lead
to
less
negative
results
there
was
another
long
interval
of
suspense
before
the
porter
reappeared
with
an
affirmative
answer
and
a
third
while
an
exiguous
and
hesitating
lift
bore
her
up
past
a
succession
of
shabby
landings
when
the
last
was
reached
and
her
guide
had
directed
her
down
a
winding
passage
that
smelt
of
luggage
she
found
herself
before
a
door
through
which
a
strong
odour
of
tobacco
reached
her
simultaneously
with
the
sounds
of
a
suppressed
altercation
her
knock
was
followed
by
a
silence
and
after
a
minute
or
two
the
door
was
opened
by
a
handsome
young
man
whose
ruffled
hair
and
general
air
of
creased
disorder
led
her
to
conclude
that
he
had
just
risen
from
a
sprawl
on
a
sofa
strewn
with
tumbled
cushions
this
sofa
and
a
grand
piano
bearing
a
basket
of
faded
roses
a
and
a
devastated
breakfast
tray
almost
filled
the
narrow
in
the
remaining
corner
of
which
another
man
short
swarthy
and
humble
sat
examining
the
lining
of
his
hat
anna
paused
in
doubt
but
on
her
naming
birch
the
young
man
politely
invited
her
to
enter
at
the
same
time
casting
an
impatient
glance
at
the
mute
spectator
in
the
background
the
latter
raising
his
eyes
which
were
round
and
bulging
fixed
them
not
on
the
young
man
but
on
anna
whom
for
a
moment
he
scrutinized
as
searchingly
as
the
interior
of
his
hat
under
his
gaze
she
had
the
sense
of
being
minutely
catalogued
and
valued
and
the
impression
when
he
finally
rose
and
moved
toward
the
door
of
having
been
accepted
as
a
better
guarantee
than
he
had
had
any
reason
to
hope
for
on
the
threshold
his
glance
crossed
that
of
the
young
man
in
an
exchange
of
intelligence
as
full
as
it
was
rapid
and
this
brief
scene
left
anna
so
oddly
enlightened
that
she
felt
no
surprise
when
her
companion
pushing
an
forward
sociably
asked
her
if
she
wouldn
t
have
a
cigarette
her
polite
refusal
provoked
the
remark
that
he
would
if
she
d
no
objection
and
while
he
groped
for
matches
in
his
loose
pockets
and
behind
the
photographs
and
letters
crowding
the
narrow
she
ventured
another
enquiry
for
birch
just
a
minute
he
smiled
i
think
the
masseur
s
with
he
spoke
in
a
smooth
denationalized
english
which
like
the
look
in
his
eyes
and
the
promptness
of
his
charming
smile
suggested
a
long
training
in
all
the
arts
of
expediency
having
finally
discovered
a
on
the
floor
beside
the
sofa
he
lit
his
cigarette
and
dropped
back
among
the
cushions
and
on
anna
s
remarking
that
she
was
sorry
to
disturb
birch
he
replied
that
that
was
all
right
and
that
she
always
kept
everybody
waiting
after
this
through
the
haze
of
his
perpetually
renewed
cigarettes
they
continued
to
chat
for
some
time
of
indifferent
topics
but
when
at
last
anna
again
suggested
the
possibility
of
her
seeing
birch
he
rose
from
his
corner
with
a
slight
shrug
and
murmuring
she
s
perfectly
hopeless
lounged
off
through
an
inner
door
anna
was
still
wondering
when
and
in
what
conjunction
of
circumstances
the
laura
had
acquired
a
partner
so
conspicuous
for
his
personal
charms
when
the
young
man
returned
to
announce
she
says
it
s
all
right
if
you
don
t
mind
seeing
her
in
he
drew
aside
to
let
anna
pass
and
she
found
herself
in
a
dim
untidy
scented
room
with
a
pink
curtain
pinned
across
its
single
window
and
a
lady
with
a
great
deal
of
fair
hair
and
uncovered
neck
smiling
at
her
from
a
pink
bed
on
which
an
immense
trailed
you
don
t
mind
do
you
he
costs
such
a
frightful
lot
that
i
can
t
afford
to
send
him
off
birch
explained
extending
a
hand
to
anna
and
leaving
her
in
doubt
as
to
whether
the
person
alluded
to
were
her
masseur
or
her
husband
before
a
reply
was
possible
there
was
a
convulsive
stir
beneath
the
pink
expanse
and
something
that
resembled
another
hurled
itself
at
anna
with
a
volley
of
sounds
like
the
popping
of
lilliputian
champagne
corks
birch
flinging
herself
forward
gasped
out
if
you
d
just
give
him
a
caramel
there
in
that
box
on
the
it
s
the
only
earthly
thing
to
stop
him
and
when
anna
had
proffered
this
sop
to
her
assailant
and
he
had
withdrawn
with
it
beneath
the
bedspread
his
mistress
sank
back
with
a
laugh
isn
t
he
a
beauty
the
prince
gave
him
to
me
down
at
nice
the
other
day
but
he
s
perfectly
awful
she
confessed
beaming
intimately
on
her
visitor
in
the
roseate
penumbra
of
the
she
presented
to
anna
s
startled
gaze
an
odd
resemblance
to
sophy
viner
or
a
suggestion
rather
of
what
sophy
viner
might
with
the
years
and
in
spite
of
the
become
larger
blonder
she
yet
had
glances
and
movements
that
disturbingly
suggested
what
was
freshest
and
most
engaging
in
the
girl
and
as
she
stretched
her
bare
plump
arm
across
the
bed
she
seemed
to
be
pulling
back
the
veil
from
dingy
distances
of
family
history
do
sit
down
if
there
s
a
place
to
sit
on
she
cordially
advised
adding
as
anna
took
the
edge
of
a
chair
hung
with
miscellaneous
raiment
my
singing
takes
so
much
time
that
i
don
t
get
a
chance
to
walk
the
fat
off
that
s
the
worst
of
being
an
anna
murmured
an
assent
i
hope
it
hasn
t
inconvenienced
you
to
see
me
i
told
birch
mr
who
the
recumbent
beauty
asked
and
then
oh
jimmy
she
faintly
laughed
as
if
more
for
her
own
enlightenment
than
anna
s
the
latter
continued
eagerly
i
understand
from
farlow
that
your
sister
was
with
you
and
i
ventured
to
come
up
because
i
wanted
to
ask
you
when
i
should
have
a
chance
of
finding
threw
back
her
head
with
a
long
stare
do
you
mean
to
say
the
idiot
at
the
door
didn
t
tell
you
sophy
went
away
last
last
night
anna
echoed
a
sudden
terror
had
possessed
her
could
it
be
that
the
girl
had
tricked
them
all
and
gone
with
owen
the
idea
was
incredible
yet
it
took
such
hold
of
her
that
she
could
hardly
steady
her
lips
to
say
the
porter
did
tell
me
but
i
thought
perhaps
he
was
mistaken
farlow
seemed
to
think
that
i
should
find
her
it
was
all
so
sudden
that
i
don
t
suppose
she
had
time
to
let
the
farlows
know
she
didn
t
get
murrett
s
wire
till
yesterday
and
she
just
pitched
her
things
into
a
trunk
and
rushed
mrs
murrett
why
yes
sophy
s
gone
to
india
with
murrett
they
re
to
meet
at
brindisi
sophy
s
sister
said
with
a
calm
smile
anna
sat
motionless
gazing
at
the
disordered
room
the
pink
bed
the
trivial
face
among
the
pillows
pursued
they
had
a
fearful
last
spring
i
daresay
you
knew
about
it
but
i
told
sophy
she
d
better
lump
it
as
long
as
the
old
woman
was
willing
to
as
an
artist
of
course
it
s
perfectly
impossible
for
me
to
have
her
with
me
of
course
anna
mechanically
assented
through
the
confused
pain
of
her
thoughts
she
was
hardly
aware
that
birch
s
explanations
were
still
continuing
naturally
i
didn
t
altogether
approve
of
her
going
back
to
that
beast
of
a
woman
i
said
all
i
could
i
told
her
she
was
a
fool
to
chuck
up
such
a
place
as
yours
but
sophy
s
restless
always
was
and
she
s
taken
it
into
her
head
she
d
rather
travel
anna
rose
from
her
seat
groping
for
some
formula
of
the
pushing
back
of
her
chair
roused
the
white
dog
s
smouldering
animosity
and
he
drowned
his
mistress
s
further
confidences
in
another
outburst
of
hysterics
through
the
tumult
anna
signed
an
inaudible
farewell
and
birch
having
momentarily
succeeded
in
suppressing
her
pet
under
a
pillow
called
out
do
come
again
i
d
love
to
sing
to
anna
murmured
a
word
of
thanks
and
turned
to
the
door
as
she
opened
it
she
heard
her
hostess
crying
after
her
jimmy
do
you
hear
me
jimmy
brance
and
then
there
being
no
response
from
the
person
summoned
do
tell
him
he
must
go
and
call
the
lift
for
you
