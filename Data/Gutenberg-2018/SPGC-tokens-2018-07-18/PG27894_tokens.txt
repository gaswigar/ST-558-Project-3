the
the
sun
had
disappeared
behind
the
snowy
peaks
of
the
cordilleras
but
the
beautiful
peruvian
sky
long
retains
through
the
transparent
veil
of
night
the
reflection
of
his
rays
the
atmosphere
is
impregnated
with
a
refreshing
coolness
which
in
these
burning
latitudes
affords
freedom
of
breath
it
is
the
hour
in
which
one
can
live
a
european
life
and
seek
without
on
the
verandas
some
cooling
gentle
zephyr
it
seems
as
if
a
metallic
roof
was
then
interposed
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
which
retaining
the
heat
and
suffering
only
the
light
to
pass
offers
beneath
its
shelter
a
reparative
repose
this
much
desired
hour
had
at
last
sounded
from
the
clock
of
the
cathedral
while
the
earliest
stars
were
rising
above
the
horizon
the
numerous
promenaders
were
traversing
the
streets
of
lima
wrapped
in
their
light
mantles
and
conversing
gravely
on
the
most
trivial
affairs
there
was
a
great
movement
of
the
populace
on
the
that
forum
of
the
ancient
city
of
kings
artisans
were
profiting
by
the
coolness
to
quit
their
daily
labors
they
circulated
actively
among
the
crowd
crying
their
various
merchandise
the
ladies
of
lima
carefully
enveloped
in
the
mantillas
which
mask
their
countenances
with
the
exception
of
the
right
eye
darted
stealthy
glances
on
the
surrounding
masses
they
undulated
through
the
groups
of
smokers
like
foam
at
the
will
of
the
waves
other
señoras
in
ball
costume
only
with
their
abundant
hair
or
some
natural
flowers
passed
in
large
calêches
throwing
on
the
nonchalant
regards
but
these
glances
were
not
bestowed
indiscriminately
upon
the
young
cavaliers
the
thoughts
of
the
noble
ladies
could
rest
only
on
aristocratic
heights
the
indians
passed
without
lifting
their
eyes
upon
them
knowing
themselves
to
be
beneath
their
notice
betraying
by
no
gesture
or
word
the
bitter
envy
of
their
hearts
they
contrasted
strongly
with
the
or
mestizoes
who
repulsed
like
the
former
vented
their
indignation
in
cries
and
protestations
the
proud
descendants
of
pizarro
marched
with
heads
high
as
in
the
times
when
their
ancestors
founded
the
city
of
kings
their
traditional
scorn
rested
alike
on
the
indians
whom
they
had
conquered
and
the
mestizoes
born
of
their
relations
with
the
natives
of
the
new
world
the
indians
on
the
contrary
were
constantly
struggling
to
break
their
chains
and
cherished
alike
aversion
toward
the
conquerors
of
the
ancient
empire
of
the
incas
and
their
haughty
and
insolent
descendants
but
the
mestizoes
spanish
in
their
contempt
for
the
indians
and
indian
in
their
hatred
which
they
had
vowed
against
the
spaniards
burned
with
both
these
vivid
and
impassioned
sentiments
a
group
of
these
young
people
stood
near
the
pretty
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
clad
in
their
a
piece
of
cloth
or
cotton
in
the
form
of
a
parallelogram
with
an
opening
in
the
middle
to
give
passage
to
the
head
in
large
pantaloons
striped
with
a
thousand
colors
with
hats
of
guayaquil
straw
they
were
talking
declaiming
gesticulating
you
are
right
andré
said
a
very
obsequious
young
man
whom
they
called
milleflores
this
was
the
friend
the
parasite
of
andré
certa
a
young
mestizo
of
swarthy
complexion
whose
thin
beard
gave
a
singular
appearance
to
his
countenance
andré
certa
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
killed
in
the
last
of
the
conspirator
lafuente
had
inherited
a
large
fortune
this
he
freely
scattered
among
his
friends
whose
humble
salutations
he
demanded
in
exchange
for
handfuls
of
gold
of
what
use
are
these
changes
in
government
these
eternal
which
disturb
peru
to
gratify
private
ambition
resumed
andré
in
a
loud
voice
what
is
it
to
me
whether
gambarra
or
santa
cruz
rule
if
there
is
no
equality
well
said
exclaimed
milleflores
who
under
the
most
republican
government
could
never
have
been
the
equal
of
a
man
of
sense
how
is
it
resumed
andré
certa
that
i
the
son
of
a
merchant
can
ride
only
in
a
calêche
drawn
by
mules
have
not
my
ships
brought
wealth
and
prosperity
to
the
country
is
not
the
aristocracy
of
piasters
worth
all
the
titles
of
spain
it
is
a
shame
resumed
the
young
mestizo
there
is
don
fernand
who
passes
in
his
carriage
drawn
by
two
horses
don
fernand
he
has
scarcely
property
enough
to
feed
his
coachman
and
horses
and
he
must
come
to
parade
himself
proudly
about
the
square
and
hold
here
is
another
the
marquis
don
vegal
a
magnificent
carriage
drawn
by
four
fine
horses
at
that
moment
entered
the
its
only
occupant
was
a
man
of
proud
mien
mingled
with
sadness
he
gazed
without
seeming
to
see
them
on
the
multitude
assembled
to
breathe
the
coolness
of
the
evening
this
man
was
the
marquis
don
vegal
knight
of
alcantara
of
malta
and
of
charles
iii
he
had
a
right
to
appear
in
this
pompous
equipage
the
viceroy
and
the
archbishop
could
alone
take
precedence
of
him
but
this
great
nobleman
came
here
from
ennui
and
not
from
ostentation
his
thoughts
were
not
depicted
on
his
countenance
they
were
concentrated
beneath
his
bent
brow
he
received
no
impression
from
exterior
objects
on
which
he
bestowed
not
a
look
and
heard
not
the
envious
reflections
of
the
mestizoes
when
his
four
horses
made
their
way
through
the
crowd
i
hate
that
man
said
andré
certa
you
will
not
hate
him
long
i
know
it
all
these
nobles
are
displaying
the
last
splendors
of
their
luxury
i
can
tell
where
their
silver
and
their
family
jewels
go
you
have
not
your
entrée
with
the
jew
samuel
for
nothing
certainly
not
on
his
are
inscribed
aristocratic
creditors
in
his
are
piled
the
wrecks
of
great
fortunes
and
in
the
day
when
the
spaniards
shall
be
as
ragged
as
their
cæsar
de
bazan
we
will
have
fine
sport
yes
we
will
have
fine
sport
dear
andré
mounted
on
your
millions
on
a
golden
pedestal
and
you
are
about
to
double
your
fortune
when
are
you
to
marry
the
beautiful
young
daughter
of
old
samuel
a
limanienne
to
the
end
of
her
nails
with
nothing
jewish
about
her
but
her
name
of
sarah
in
a
month
replied
andré
certa
proudly
there
will
be
no
fortune
in
peru
which
can
compete
with
mine
but
why
asked
some
one
do
you
not
espouse
some
spanish
girl
of
high
descent
i
despise
these
people
as
much
as
i
hate
them
andré
certa
concealed
the
fact
of
his
having
been
repulsed
by
several
noble
families
into
which
he
had
sought
to
introduce
himself
his
interlocutor
still
wore
an
expression
of
doubt
and
the
brow
of
the
mestizo
had
contracted
when
the
latter
was
rudely
elbowed
by
a
man
of
tall
stature
whose
gray
hairs
proclaimed
him
to
be
at
least
fifty
while
the
muscular
force
of
his
firmly
knit
limbs
seemed
undiminished
by
age
this
man
was
clad
in
a
brown
vest
through
which
appeared
a
coarse
shirt
with
a
broad
collar
his
short
breeches
striped
with
green
were
fastened
by
red
garters
to
stockings
of
on
his
feet
were
sandals
made
of
prepared
for
this
purpose
beneath
his
hat
gleamed
large
his
complexion
was
dark
after
having
jostled
andré
certa
he
looked
at
him
fixedly
but
with
no
particular
expression
miserable
indian
exclaimed
the
mestizo
raising
his
hand
upon
him
his
companions
restrained
him
milleflores
whose
face
was
pale
with
terror
exclaimed
andré
andré
take
care
a
vile
slave
to
presume
to
elbow
me
it
is
a
madman
it
is
the
the
as
the
name
indicated
was
an
indian
of
the
mountains
he
continued
to
fix
his
eyes
on
the
mestizo
whom
he
had
intentionally
jostled
the
latter
whose
anger
was
unbounded
had
seized
a
poignard
at
his
girdle
and
was
about
to
have
rushed
on
the
impassable
aggressor
when
a
guttural
cry
like
that
of
the
a
kind
of
linnet
of
peru
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
of
promenaders
and
the
sambo
disappeared
brutal
and
cowardly
exclaimed
andré
control
yourself
said
milleflores
softly
let
us
leave
the
the
limanienne
ladies
are
too
haughty
here
as
he
said
these
words
the
brave
milleflores
looked
cautiously
around
to
see
whether
he
was
not
within
reach
of
the
foot
or
arm
of
some
indian
in
the
neighborhood
in
an
hour
i
must
be
at
the
house
of
jew
samuel
said
andré
in
an
hour
we
have
time
to
pass
to
the
del
you
can
offer
some
oranges
or
ananas
to
the
charming
who
promenade
there
shall
we
go
gentlemen
the
group
directed
their
steps
toward
the
extremity
of
the
square
and
began
to
descend
the
street
of
danger
where
milleflores
hoped
his
good
looks
would
be
appreciated
but
it
was
nightfall
and
the
young
limaniennes
merited
better
than
ever
their
name
of
hidden
for
they
drew
their
mantles
more
closely
over
their
countenances
the
was
all
alive
the
cries
and
the
tumult
were
redoubled
the
guards
on
horseback
stationed
before
the
central
portico
of
the
viceroy
palace
situated
on
the
north
side
of
the
square
could
scarcely
maintain
their
position
amid
the
shifting
crowd
there
were
merchants
for
all
customers
and
customers
for
all
merchants
the
greatest
variety
of
trades
seemed
to
be
congregated
there
and
from
the
de
to
the
de
there
was
one
immense
display
of
articles
of
every
kind
the
serving
at
once
as
promenade
bazaar
market
and
fair
the
of
the
viceroy
palace
is
occupied
by
shops
along
the
first
story
runs
an
immense
gallery
where
the
crowd
can
promenade
on
days
of
public
rejoicing
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
rises
the
cathedral
with
its
steeples
and
light
balustrades
proudly
adorning
its
two
towers
the
basement
story
of
the
edifice
being
ten
feet
high
and
containing
warehouses
full
of
the
products
of
tropical
climates
in
the
centre
of
this
square
is
situated
the
beautiful
fountain
constructed
in
by
the
orders
of
the
viceroy
the
comte
de
salvatierra
from
the
top
of
the
pillar
which
rises
in
the
middle
of
the
fountain
and
is
surmounted
with
a
statue
of
fame
the
water
falls
in
sheets
and
is
discharged
into
a
basin
beneath
through
the
mouths
of
lions
it
is
here
that
the
load
their
mules
with
barrels
attach
a
bell
to
a
hoop
and
mount
behind
their
liquid
merchandise
this
square
is
therefore
noisy
from
morning
till
evening
and
when
the
stars
of
night
rise
above
the
snowy
summits
of
the
cordilleras
the
tumult
of
the
of
lima
equals
the
matinal
hubbub
of
the
merchants
nevertheless
when
the
evening
sounds
from
the
bell
of
the
cathedral
all
this
noise
suddenly
ceases
to
the
clamor
of
pleasure
succeeds
the
murmur
of
prayer
the
women
pause
in
their
walk
and
put
their
hands
on
their
rosaries
invoking
the
virgin
mary
then
not
a
merchant
dares
sell
his
merchandise
not
a
customer
thinks
of
buying
and
this
square
so
recently
animated
seems
to
have
become
a
vast
solitude
while
the
limanians
paused
and
knelt
at
the
sound
of
the
a
young
girl
carefully
surrounded
by
her
discreet
mantle
sought
to
pass
through
the
praying
multitude
she
was
followed
by
a
mestizo
woman
a
sort
of
duenna
who
watched
every
glance
and
step
the
duenna
as
if
she
had
not
understood
the
warning
bell
continued
her
way
through
the
devout
populace
to
the
general
surprise
succeeded
harsh
epithets
the
young
girl
would
have
stopped
but
the
duenna
kept
on
do
you
see
that
daughter
of
satan
said
some
one
near
her
who
is
that
that
impious
dancer
it
is
one
of
the
carcaman
women
a
reproachful
name
bestowed
upon
europeans
the
young
girl
at
last
stopped
blushing
and
confused
suddenly
a
a
merchant
of
mules
seized
her
by
the
shoulder
and
would
have
compelled
her
to
kneel
but
he
had
scarcely
laid
his
hand
upon
her
when
a
vigorous
arm
rudely
felled
him
to
the
ground
this
scene
rapid
as
lightning
was
followed
by
a
moment
of
confusion
save
yourself
miss
said
a
gentle
and
respectful
voice
in
the
ear
of
the
young
girl
the
latter
turned
pale
with
terror
and
saw
a
young
indian
of
tall
stature
who
with
his
arms
tranquilly
folded
was
awaiting
with
firm
foot
the
attack
of
his
adversary
we
are
lost
exclaimed
the
duenna
let
us
go
for
the
love
of
god
and
she
seized
the
arm
of
the
young
girl
who
disappeared
while
the
crowd
rose
and
dispersed
the
had
risen
bruised
with
his
fall
and
thinking
it
not
prudent
to
seek
revenge
rejoined
his
mules
muttering
threats

directions
from
which
it
never
varies
either
it
blows
from

and
becomes
cool
by
crossing
the
pacific
ocean
or
it
comes
from
the
impregnated
with
the
mild
atmosphere
of
the
forests
and
the
freshness
which
it
has
derived
from
the
icy
summits
of
the
cordilleras
the
nights
beneath
tropical
latitudes
are
very
beautiful
and
very
clear
they
mysteriously
prepare
that
beneficent
dew
which
fertilizes
a
soil
exposed
to
the
rays
of
a
cloudless
sky
so
the
inhabitants
of
lima
prolong
their
nocturnal
conversations
and
receptions
household
labors
are
quietly
finished
in
the
dwellings
refreshed
by
the
shadows
and
the
streets
are
soon
deserted
scarcely
is
some
still
haunted
by
the
drinkers
of
or
these
the
young
girl
whom
we
have
seen
carefully
avoided
crossing
in
the
middle
of
the
numerous
squares
scattered
about
the
city
she
arrived
without
interruption
at
the
bridge
of
the
rimac
listening
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
which
her
emotion
exaggerated
and
hearing
only
the
bells
of
a
train
of
mules
conducted
by
its
or
the
joyous
of
some
indian
this
young
girl
was
called
sarah
and
was
returning
to
the
house
of
the
jew
samuel
her
father
she
was
clad
in
a
of
satin
a
kind
of
petticoat
of
a
dark
color
plaited
in
elastic
folds
and
very
narrow
at
the
bottom
which
compelled
her
to
take
short
steps
and
gave
her
that
graceful
delicacy
peculiar
to
the
limanienne
ladies
this
petticoat
ornamented
with
lace
and
flowers
was
in
part
covered
with
a
silk
mantle
which
was
raised
above
the
head
and
enveloped
it
like
a
hood
stockings
of
exquisite
fineness
and
little
satin
shoes
peeped
out
beneath
the
graceful
bracelets
of
great
value
encircled
the
arms
of
the
young
girl
whose
rich
toilet
was
of
exquisite
taste
and
her
whole
person
redolent
of
that
charm
so
well
expressed
by
the
spanish
word
milleflores
might
well
say
to
andré
certa
that
his
betrothed
had
nothing
of
the
jewess
but
the
name
for
she
was
a
faithful
specimen
of
those
admirable
señoras
whose
beauty
is
above
all
praise
the
duenna
an
old
jewess
whose
countenance
was
expressive
of
avarice
and
cupidity
was
a
devoted
servant
of
samuel
who
paid
her
liberally
at
the
moment
when
these
two
women
entered
the
suburb
of
san
lazaro
a
man
clad
in
the
robe
of
a
monk
and
with
his
head
covered
with
a
cowl
passed
near
them
and
looked
at
them
attentively
this
man
of
tall
stature
possessed
a
countenance
expressive
of
gentleness
and
benevolence
it
was
padre
joachim
de
camarones
he
threw
a
glance
of
intelligence
on
sarah
who
immediately
looked
at
her
follower
the
latter
was
still
grumbling
muttering
and
whining
which
prevented
her
seeing
any
thing
the
young
girl
turned
toward
the
good
father
and
made
a
graceful
sign
with
her
hand
well
señora
said
the
old
woman
sharply
is
it
not
enough
to
have
been
insulted
by
these
christians
that
you
should
stop
to
look
at
a
priest
sarah
did
not
reply
shall
we
see
you
one
day
with
rosary
in
hand
engaged
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
church
the
ceremonies
of
the
church
funciones
de
are
the
great
business
of
the
limanian
ladies
you
make
strange
suppositions
replied
the
young
girl
blushing
strange
as
your
conduct
what
would
my
master
samuel
say
if
he
knew
what
had
taken
place
this
evening
am
i
to
blame
because
a
brutal
muleteer
chose
to
address
me
i
understand
señora
said
the
old
woman
shaking
her
head
and
will
not
speak
of
the
then
the
young
man
did
wrong
in
defending
me
from
the
abuse
of
the
populace
is
it
the
first
time
the
indian
has
thrown
himself
in
your
way
the
countenance
of
the
young
girl
was
fortunately
sheltered
by
her
mantle
for
the
darkness
would
not
have
sufficed
to
conceal
her
emotion
from
the
inquisitive
glance
of
the
duenna
but
let
us
leave
the
indian
where
he
is
resumed
the
old
woman
it
is
not
my
business
to
watch
him
what
i
complain
of
is
that
in
order
not
to
disturb
these
christians
you
wished
to
remain
among
them
had
you
not
some
desire
to
kneel
with
them
ah
señora
your
father
would
soon
dismiss
me
if
i
were
guilty
of
such
apostasy
but
the
young
girl
no
longer
heard
the
remark
of
the
old
woman
on
the
subject
of
the
young
indian
had
inspired
her
with
sweeter
thoughts
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
intervention
of
this
young
man
was
providential
and
she
turned
several
times
to
see
if
he
had
not
followed
her
in
the
shadow
sarah
had
in
her
heart
a
certain
natural
confidence
which
became
her
wonderfully
she
felt
herself
to
be
the
child
of
these
warm
latitudes
which
the
sun
decorates
with
surprising
vegetation
proud
as
a
spaniard
if
she
had
fixed
her
regards
on
this
man
it
was
because
he
had
stood
proudly
in
the
presence
of
her
pride
and
had
not
begged
a
glance
as
a
reward
of
his
protection
in
imagining
that
the
indian
was
near
her
sarah
was
not
mistaken
martin
paz
after
having
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
young
girl
wished
to
ensure
her
safe
retreat
so
when
the
promenaders
had
dispersed
he
followed
her
without
being
perceived
by
her
but
without
concealing
himself
the
darkness
alone
favoring
his
pursuit
this
martin
paz
was
a
handsome
young
man
wearing
with
unparalleled
nobility
the
national
costume
of
the
indian
of
the
mountains
from
his
straw
hat
escaped
fine
black
hair
whose
curls
harmonized
with
the
bronze
of
his
manly
face
his
eyes
shone
with
infinite
sweetness
like
the
transparent
atmosphere
of
starry
nights
his
nose
surmounted
a
pretty
mouth
unlike
that
of
most
of
his
race
he
was
one
of
the
noblest
descendants
of
and
his
veins
were
full
of
that
ardent
blood
which
leads
men
to
the
accomplishment
of
lofty
deeds
he
was
proudly
draped
in
his
of
brilliant
colors
at
his
girdle
hung
one
of
those
malay
poignards
so
terrible
in
a
practiced
hand
for
they
seem
to
be
riveted
to
the
arm
which
strikes
in
north
america
on
the
shores
of
lake
ontario
martin
paz
would
have
been
a
great
chief
among
those
wandering
tribes
which
have
fought
with
the
english
so
many
heroic
combats
martin
paz
knew
that
sarah
was
the
daughter
of
the
wealthy
samuel
he
knew
her
to
be
the
most
charming
woman
in
lima
he
knew
her
to
be
betrothed
to
the
opulent
mestizo
andré
certa
he
knew
that
by
her
birth
her
position
and
her
wealth
she
was
beyond
the
reach
of
his
heart
but
he
forgot
all
these
impossibilities
in
his
passion
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
beautiful
young
girl
belonged
to
him
as
the
llama
to
the
peruvian
forests
as
the
eagle
to
the
depths
of
immensity
plunged
in
his
reflections
martin
paz
hastened
his
steps
to
see
the
of
the
young
girl
sweep
the
threshold
of
the
paternal
dwelling
and
sarah
herself
then
her
mantilla
cast
on
him
a
bewildering
glance
of
gratitude
he
was
quickly
joined
by
two
indians
of
the
species
of
pillagers
and
robbers
who
walked
beside
him
martin
paz
said
one
of
them
to
him
you
ought
this
very
evening
to
meet
our
brethren
in
the
mountains
i
shall
be
there
coldly
replied
the
other
the
schooner
has
appeared
in
sight
from
callao
tacked
for
a
few
moments
then
protected
by
the
point
rapidly
disappeared
she
will
undoubtedly
approach
the
land
near
the
mouth
of
the
rimac
and
our
bark
canoes
must
be
there
to
relieve
her
of
her
merchandise
we
shall
need
your
presence
you
are
losing
time
by
your
observations
martin
paz
knows
his
duty
and
he
will
do
it
it
is
in
the
name
of
the
sambo
that
we
speak
to
you
here
it
is
in
my
own
name
that
i
speak
to
you
do
you
not
fear
that
he
will
find
your
presence
in
the
suburb
of
san
lazaro
at
this
hour
unaccountable
i
am
where
my
fancy
and
my
will
have
brought
me
before
the
house
of
the
jew
those
of
my
brethren
who
are
disposed
to
find
fault
can
meet
me
in
the
mountain
the
eyes
of
the
three
men
sparkled
and
this
was
all
the
regained
the
bank
of
the
rimac
and
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
died
away
in
the
darkness
martin
paz
had
hastily
approached
the
house
of
the
jew
this
house
like
all
those
of
lima
had
but
two
stories
the
ground
floor
built
of
bricks
was
surmounted
with
walls
formed
of
canes
tied
together
and
covered
with
plaster
all
this
part
of
the
building
constructed
to
resist
earthquakes
imitated
by
a
skillful
painting
the
bricks
of
the
lower
story
the
square
roof
called
was
covered
with
flowers
and
formed
a
terrace
full
of
perfumes
and
pretty
points
of
view
a
vast
gate
placed
between
two
pavilions
gave
access
to
a
court
but
as
usual
these
pavilions
had
no
window
opening
upon
the
street
the
clock
of
the
parish
church
was
striking
eleven
when
martin
paz
stopped
before
the
dwelling
of
sarah
profound
silence
reigned
around
a
flickering
light
within
proved
that
the
saloon
of
the
jew
samuel
was
still
occupied
why
does
the
indian
stand
motionless
before
these
silent
walls
the
cool
atmosphere
woos
him
with
its
transparency
and
its
perfumes
the
radiant
stars
send
down
upon
the
sleeping
earth
rays
of
diaphanous
mildness
the
white
constellations
illumine
the
darkness
with
their
enchanting
light
his
heart
believes
in
those
sympathetic
communications
which
brave
time
and
distance
a
white
form
appears
upon
the
terrace
amid
the
flowers
to
which
night
has
only
left
a
vague
outline
without
diminishing
their
delicious
perfumes
the
dahlias
mingle
with
the
mentzelias
with
the
helianthus
and
beneath
the
occidental
breeze
form
a
waving
basket
which
surrounds
sarah
the
young
and
beautiful
jewess
martin
paz
involuntarily
raises
his
hands
and
clasps
them
with
adoration
suddenly
the
white
form
sinks
down
as
if
terrified
martin
paz
turns
and
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
andré
certa
since
when
do
the
indians
pass
their
nights
in
contemplation
andré
certa
spoke
angrily
since
the
indians
have
trodden
the
soil
of
their
ancestors
have
they
no
longer
on
the
mountain
side
some
to
chant
some
to
dance
with
the
girls
of
their
caste
the
replied
the
indian
in
a
high
voice
bestow
their
devotion
where
it
is
merited
the
indians
love
according
to
their
hearts
andré
certa
became
pale
with
anger
he
advanced
a
step
toward
his
immovable
rival
wretch
will
you
quit
this
place
rather
quit
it
yourself
shouted
martin
paz
and
two
poignards
gleamed
in
the
two
right
hands
of
the
adversaries
they
were
of
equal
stature
they
seemed
of
equal
strength
and
the
lightnings
of
their
eyes
were
reflected
in
the
steel
of
their
arms
andré
certa
rapidly
raised
his
arm
which
he
dropped
still
more
quickly
but
his
poignard
had
encountered
the
malay
poignard
of
the
indian
at
the
fire
which
flashed
from
this
shock
andré
saw
the
arm
of
martin
paz
suspended
over
his
head
and
immediately
rolled
on
the
earth
his
arm
pierced
through
help
help
he
exclaimed
the
door
of
the
jew
house
opened
at
his
cries
some
mestizoes
ran
from
a
neighboring
house
some
pursued
the
indian
who
fled
rapidly
others
raised
the
wounded
man
he
had
swooned
who

toward

he
had
scarcely
looked
upon
him
when
he
exclaimed
let
the
poor
young
man
be
carried
into
my
house
this
is
a
strange
mischance
this
man
was
the
jew
samuel
he
had
just
recognized
the
betrothed
of
his
daughter
martin

thanks
to
the
darkness
and
the
rapidity
of
his
flight
may
hope
to
escape
his
pursuers
he
has
risked
his
life
an
indian
assassin
of
a
mestizo
if
he
can
gain
the

country
he
is
safe

four
in

at

the
stone
bridge
which
he
had
already
crossed
the
indians
and
some
soldiers
who
had
joined
them
pursue
him
closely
he
springs
upon
the
bridge
unfortunately
a
patrol
appears
at
the
opposite
extremity
martin

can
neither
advance
nor
retrace
his
steps
without
hesitation
he
clears
the
parapet
and
leaps
into
the
rapid
current
which
breaks
against
the
corners
of
the
stones
the
pursuers
spring
upon
the
banks
below
the
bridge
to
seize
the
swimmer
at
his
landing

it

the

where
a
jew
andré
certa
once
introduced
into
the
house
of
samuel
and
laid
in
a
bed
hastily
prepared
recovered
his
senses
and
pressed
the
hand
of
the
old
jew
the
physician
summoned
by
one
of
the
domestics
was
promptly
in
attendance
the
wound
appeared
to
be
a
slight
one
the
shoulder
of
the
mestizo
had
been
pierced
in
such
a
manner
that
the
steel
had
only
glided
among
the
flesh
in
a
few
days
andré
certa
might
be
once
more
upon
his
feet
when
samuel
was
left
alone
with
andré
the
latter
said
to
him
you
would
do
well
to
wall
up
the
gate
which
leads
to
your
terrace
master
samuel
what
fear
you
andré
i
fear
lest
sarah
should
present
herself
there
to
the
contemplation
of
the
indians
it
was
not
a
robber
who
attacked
me
it
was
a
rival
from
whom
i
have
escaped
but
by
miracle
by
the
holy
tables
it
is
a
task
to
bring
up
young
girls
exclaimed
the
jew
but
you
are
mistaken
señor
he
resumed
sarah
will
be
a
dutiful
spouse
i
spare
no
pains
that
she
may
do
you
honor
andré
certa
half
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
master
samuel
there
is
one
thing
which
you
do
not
enough
remember
that
i
pay
you
for
the
hand
of
sarah
a
hundred
thousand
piasters
señor
replied
the
jew
with
a
miserly
chuckle
i
remember
it
so
well
that
i
am
ready
now
to
exchange
this
receipt
for
the
money
as
he
said
this
samuel
drew
from
his
a
paper
which
andré
certa
repulsed
with
his
hand
the
bargain
is
not
complete
until
sarah
has
become
my
wife
and
she
will
never
be
such
if
her
hand
is
to
be
disputed
by
such
an
adversary
you
know
master
samuel
what
is
my
object
in
espousing
sarah
i
wish
to
be
the
equal
of
this
nobility
which
casts
such
scornful
glances
upon
us
and
you
will
señor
for
you
see
the
proudest
grandees
of
spain
throng
our
saloons
around
the
pearl
of
lima
where
has
sarah
been
this
evening
to
the
israelitish
temple
with
old
ammon
why
should
sarah
attend
your
religious
rites
i
am
a
jew
señor
replied
samuel
proudly
and
would
sarah
be
my
daughter
if
she
did
not
fulfill
the
duties
of
my
religion
the
old
jew
remained
sad
and
silent
for
several
minutes
his
bent
brow
rested
on
one
of
his
withered
hands
his
face
usually
bronze
was
now
almost
pale
beneath
a
brown
cap
appeared
locks
of
an
indescribable
color
he
was
clad
in
a
sort
of
fastened
around
the
waist
this
old
man
trafficked
every
where
and
in
every
thing
he
might
have
been
a
descendant
of
the
judas
who
sold
his
master
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
he
had
been
a
resident
of
lima
ten
years
his
taste
and
his
economy
had
led
him
to
choose
his
dwelling
at
the
extremity
of
the
suburb
of
san
lazaro
and
from
thence
he
entered
into
various
speculations
to
make
money
by
degrees
samuel
assumed
a
luxury
uncommon
in
misers
his
house
was
sumptuously
furnished
his
numerous
domestics
his
splendid
equipages
betokened
immense
revenues
sarah
was
then
eight
years
of
age
already
graceful
and
charming
she
pleased
all
and
was
the
idol
of
the
jew
all
her
inclinations
were
unhesitatingly
gratified
always
elegantly
dressed
she
attracted
the
eyes
of
the
most
fastidious
of
which
her
father
seemed
strangely
careless
it
will
readily
be
understood
how
the
mestizo
andré
certa
became
enamored
of
the
beautiful
jewess
what
would
have
appeared
inexplicable
to
the
public
was
the
hundred
thousand
piasters
the
price
of
her
hand
but
this
bargain
was
secret
and
besides
samuel
trafficked
in
sentiments
as
in
native
productions
a
banker
usurer
merchant
he
had
the
talent
to
do
business
with
everybody
the
schooner
which
was
hovering
about
the
mouth
of
the
rimac
belonged
to
the
jew
samuel
amid
this
life
of
business
and
speculation
this
man
fulfilled
the
duties
of
his
religion
with
scrupulous
punctuality
his
daughter
had
been
carefully
instructed
in
the
israelitish
faith
and
practices
so
when
the
mestizo
had
manifested
his
displeasure
on
this
subject
the
old
man
remained
mute
and
pensive
and
andré
certa
broke
the
silence
saying
do
you
forget
that
the
motive
for
which
i
espouse
sarah
will
compel
her
to
become
a
convert
to
catholicism
it
is
not
my
fault
added
the
mestizo
but
in
spite
of
you
in
spite
of
me
in
spite
of
herself
it
will
be
so
you
are
right
said
the
jew
sadly
but
by
the
bible
sarah
shall
be
a
jewess
as
long
as
she
is
my
daughter
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
chamber
opened
and
the
of
the
jew
samuel
respectfully
entered
is
the
murderer
arrested
asked
the
old
man
we
have
reason
to
believe
he
is
dead
dead
repeated
andré
with
a
joyful
exclamation
caught
between
us
and
a
company
of
soldiers
replied
the
he
was
obliged
to
leap
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
he
has
thrown
himself
into
the
rimac
exclaimed
andré
and
how
do
you
know
that
he
has
not
reached
the
shore
asked
samuel
the
melting
of
the
snow
has
made
the
current
rapid
at
that
spot
besides
we
stationed
ourselves
on
each
side
of
the
river
and
he
did
not
i
have
left
sentinels
who
will
pass
the
night
in
watching
the
banks
it
is
well
said
the
old
man
he
has
met
with
a
just
fate
did
you
recognize
him
in
his
flight
perfectly
sir
it
was
martin
paz
the
indian
of
the
mountains
has
this
man
been
observing
sarah
for
some
time
past
i
do
not
know
replied
the
servant
summon
old
ammon
the
withdrew
these
indians
said
the
old
man
have
secret
understandings
among
themselves
i
must
know
whether
the
pursuit
of
this
man
dates
from
a
distant
period
the
duenna
entered
and
remained
standing
before
her
master
does
my
daughter
asked
samuel
know
any
thing
of
what
has
taken
place
this
morning
when
the
cries
of
your
servants
awoke
me
i
ran
to
the
chamber
of
the
señora
and
found
her
almost
motionless
and
of
a
mortal
paleness
fatality
said
samuel
continue
added
he
seeing
that
the
mestizo
was
apparently
asleep
to
my
urgent
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
her
agitation
the
señora
would
not
reply
she
retired
without
accepting
my
services
and
i
withdrew
has
this
indian
often
thrown
himself
in
her
way
i
do
not
know
master
nevertheless
i
have
often
met
him
in
the
streets
of
san
lazaro
and
you
have
told
me
nothing
of
this
he
came
to
her
assistance
this
evening
on
the
added
the
old
duenna
her
assistance
how
the
old
woman
related
the
scene
with
downcast
head
ah
my
daughter
wish
to
kneel
among
these
christians
exclaimed
the
jew
angrily
and
i
knew
nothing
of
all
this
you
deserve
that
i
should
dismiss
you
the
duenna
went
out
of
the
room
in
confusion
do
you
not
see
that
the
marriage
should
take
place
soon
said
andré
certa
i
am
not
asleep
master
samuel
but
i
need
rest
now
and
i
will
dream
of
our
espousals
at
these
words
the
old
man
slowly
retired
before
regaining
his
room
he
wished
to
assure
himself
of
the
condition
of
his
daughter
and
softly
entered
the
chamber
of
sarah
the
young
girl
was
in
an
agitated
slumber
in
the
midst
of
the
rich
silk
drapery
around
her
a
of
alabaster
suspended
from
the
arabesques
of
the
ceiling
shed
its
soft
light
upon
her
beautiful
countenance
the
window
admitted
through
lowered
blinds
the
quiet
coolness
of
the
air
impregnated
with
the
penetrating
perfumes
of
the
aloes
and
magnolia
creole
luxury
was
displayed
in
the
thousand
objects
of
art
which
good
taste
and
grace
had
dispersed
on
richly
carved
and
beneath
the
vague
and
placid
rays
of
night
it
seemed
as
if
the
soul
of
the
child
was
sporting
amid
these
wonders
the
old
man
approached
the
bed
of
sarah
he
bent
over
her
to
listen
the
beautiful
jewess
seemed
disturbed
by
sorrowful
thoughts
and
more
than
once
the
name
of
martin
paz
escaped
her
lips
samuel
regained
his
chamber
uttering
maledictions
at
the
first
rays
of
morning
sarah
hastily
arose
liberta
a
indian
attached
to
her
service
hastened
to
her
and
in
pursuance
of
her
orders
saddled
a
mule
for
his
mistress
and
a
horse
for
himself
sarah
was
accustomed
to
take
accompanied
by
this
indian
who
was
entirely
devoted
to
her
she
was
clad
in
a
of
a
brown
color
and
a
mantle
of
cashmere
with
long
tassels
her
head
was
not
covered
with
the
usual
hood
but
sheltered
beneath
the
broad
brim
of
a
straw
hat
which
left
her
long
black
tresses
to
float
over
her
shoulders
and
to
conceal
any
unusual
she
held
between
her
lips
a
of
perfumed
tobacco
liberta
clad
like
an
indian
of
the
mountains
prepared
to
accompany
his
mistress
liberta
said
the
young
girl
to
him
remember
to
be
blind
and
dumb
once
in
the
saddle
sarah
left
the
city
as
usual
and
began
to
ride
through
the
country
she
directed
her
way
toward
callao
the
port
was
in
full
animation
there
had
been
a
conflict
during
the
night
between
the
and
a
schooner
whose
undecided
movements
betrayed
a
fraudulent
speculation
the
seemed
to
have
been
awaiting
some
suspicious
barks
near
the
mouth
of
the
rimac
but
before
the
latter
could
reach
her
she
had
been
compelled
to
flee
before
the
boats
which
had
boldly
given
her
chase
various
rumors
were
in
circulation
respecting
the
destination
of
this
vessel
which
bore
no
name
on
her
stern
according
to
some
this
schooner
laden
with
colombian
troops
was
seeking
to
seize
the
principal
vessels
of
callao
for
bolivar
had
it
in
his
heart
to
revenge
the
affront
given
to
the
soldiers
left
by
him
in
peru
and
who
had
been
driven
from
it
in
disgrace
according
to
others
the
schooner
was
simply
a
smuggler
of
european
goods
without
troubling
herself
about
these
rumors
more
or
less
important
sarah
whose
ride
to
the
port
had
been
only
a
pretext
returned
toward
lima
which
she
reached
near
the
banks
of
the
rimac
she
ascended
them
toward
the
bridge
numbers
of
soldiers
mestizoes
and
indians
were
stationed
at
various
points
on
the
shore
liberta
had
acquainted
the
young
girl
with
the
events
of
the
night
in
compliance
with
her
orders
he
interrogated
some
indians
leaning
over
the
parapet
and
learned
that
although
martin
paz
had
been
undoubtedly
drowned
his
body
had
not
yet
been
recovered
sarah
was
pale
and
almost
fainting
it
required
all
her
strength
of
soul
not
to
abandon
herself
to
her
grief
among
the
people
wandering
on
the
banks
she
remarked
an
indian
with
ferocious
features
the
sambo
he
was
crouched
on
the
bank
and
seemed
a
prey
to
despair
as
sarah
passed
near
the
old
mountaineer
she
heard
these
words
full
of
gloomy
anger
wo
wo
they
have
killed
the
son
of
the
sambo
they
have
killed
my
son
the
young
girl
resolutely
drew
herself
up
made
a
sign
to
liberta
to
follow
her
and
this
time
without
caring
whether
she
was
observed
or
not
went
directly
to
the
church
of
santa
anna
left
her
mule
in
charge
of
the
indian
entered
the
catholic
temple
and
asking
for
the
good
father
joachim
knelt
on
the
stone
steps
praying
to
jesus
and
mary
for
the
soul
of
martin
paz
chapter
iv
a
spanish
grandee
any
other
than
the
indian
martin
paz
would
have
indeed
perished
in
the
waters
of
the
rimac
to
escape
death
his
surprising
strength
his
insurmountable
will
and
especially
his
sublime
coolness
one
of
the
privileges
of
the
free
hordes
of
the
of
the
new
world
had
all
been
found
necessary
martin
knew
that
his
pursuers
would
concentrate
their
efforts
to
seize
him
below
the
bridge
it
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
overcome
the
current
and
that
the
indian
must
be
carried
down
but
by
vigorous
strokes
he
succeeded
in
stemming
the
torrent
he
dived
repeatedly
and
finding
the
less
strong
at
last
ventured
to
land
and
concealed
himself
behind
a
thicket
of
but
what
was
to
become
of
him
retreat
was
perilous
the
soldiers
might
change
their
plans
and
ascend
the
river
the
indian
must
then
inevitably
be
captured
he
would
lose
his
life
and
worse
yet
sarah
his
decision
was
rapidly
made
through
the
narrow
streets
and
deserted
squares
he
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
city
but
it
was
important
that
he
should
be
supposed
dead
he
therefore
avoided
being
seen
since
his
garments
dripping
with
water
and
covered
with
would
have
betrayed
him
to
avoid
the
indiscreet
glances
of
some
belated
inhabitants
martin
paz
was
obliged
to
pass
through
one
of
the
widest
streets
of
the
city
a
house
still
brilliantly
illuminated
presented
itself
the
was
open
to
give
passage
to
the
elegant
equipages
which
were
issuing
from
the
court
and
conveying
to
their
respective
dwellings
the
nobles
of
the
spanish
aristocracy
the
indian
adroitly
glided
into
this
magnificent
dwelling
he
could
not
remain
in
the
street
where
curious
were
thronging
around
attracted
by
the
carriages
the
gates
of
the
hotel
were
soon
carefully
closed
and
the
indian
found
flight
impossible
some
lacqueys
were
going
to
and
fro
in
the
court
martin
paz
rapidly
passed
up
a
rich
stairway
of
ornamented
with
valuable
tapestry
the
saloons
still
illuminated
presented
no
convenient
place
of
refuge
he
crossed
them
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
disappeared
in
a
room
filled
with
protecting
darkness
the
last
lustres
were
quickly
extinguished
and
the
house
became
profoundly
silent
the
indian
paz
as
a
man
of
energy
to
whom
moments
are
precious
hastened
to
reconnoitre
the
place
and
to
find
the
surest
means
of
evasion
the
windows
of
this
chamber
opened
on
an
interior
garden
flight
was
practicable
and
martin
paz
was
about
to
spring
from
them
when
he
heard
these
words
señor
you
have
forgotten
to
take
the
diamonds
which
i
had
left
on
that
table
martin
paz
turned
a
man
of
noble
stature
and
of
great
pride
of
countenance
was
pointing
to
a
at
this
insult
martin
paz
laid
his
hand
on
his
poignard
he
approached
the
spaniard
who
stood
unmoved
and
in
a
first
impulse
of
indignation
raised
his
arm
to
strike
him
but
turning
his
weapon
against
himself
said
in
a
deep
tone
señor
if
you
repeat
such
words
i
will
kill
myself
at
your
feet
the
spaniard
astonished
looked
at
the
indian
more
attentively
and
through
his
tangled
and
dripping
locks
perceived
so
lofty
a
frankness
that
he
felt
a
strange
sympathy
fill
his
heart
he
went
toward
the
window
gently
closed
it
and
returned
toward
the
indian
whose
poignard
had
fallen
to
the
ground
who
are
you
said
he
to
him
the
indian
martin
paz
i
am
pursued
by
soldiers
for
having
defended
myself
against
a
mestizo
who
attacked
me
and
levelled
him
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
from
my
poignard
this
mestizo
is
the
betrothed
of
a
young
girl
whom
i
love
now
señor
you
can
deliver
me
to
my
enemies
if
you
judge
it
noble
and
right
sir
replied
the
spaniard
gravely
i
depart
for
the
baths
of
chorillos
if
you
please
to
accompany
me
you
will
be
for
the
present
safe
from
pursuit
and
will
never
have
reason
to
complain
of
the
hospitality
of
the
marquis
don
vegal
martin
paz
bent
coldly
without
manifesting
any
emotion
you
can
rest
until
morning
on
this
bed
resumed
don
vegal
no
one
here
will
suspect
your
retreat
señor
the
spaniard
went
out
of
the
room
and
left
the
indian
moved
to
tears
by
a
confidence
so
generous
he
yielded
himself
entirely
to
the
protection
of
the
marquis
and
without
thinking
that
his
slumbers
might
be
taken
advantage
of
to
seize
him
slept
with
peaceful
security
the
next
day
at
sunrise
the
marquis
gave
the
last
orders
for
his
departure
and
summoned
the
jew
samuel
to
come
to
him
in
the
meantime
he
attended
the
morning
mass
this
was
a
custom
generally
observed
by
the
aristocracy
from
its
very
foundation
lima
had
been
essentially
catholic
besides
its
numerous
churches
it
numbered
convents
seventeen
monasteries
and
four
or
houses
of
retreat
for
females
who
did
not
take
the
vows
each
of
these
establishments
possessed
a
chapel
so
that
there
were
at
lima
more
than
a
hundred
edifices
for
worship
where
eight
hundred
secular
or
regular
priests
three
hundred
and
sisters
performed
the
duties
of
religion
as
don
vegal
entered
the
church
of
santa
anna
he
noticed
a
young
girl
kneeling
in
prayer
and
in
tears
there
was
so
much
of
grief
in
her
depression
that
the
marquis
could
not
look
at
her
without
emotion
and
he
was
preparing
to
console
her
by
some
kind
words
when
father
joachim
de
camarones
approached
him
saying
in
a
low
voice
señor
don
vegal
pray
do
not
approach
her
then
he
made
a
sign
to
sarah
who
followed
him
to
an
obscure
and
deserted
chapel
don
vegal
directed
his
steps
to
the
altar
and
listened
to
the
mass
then
as
he
was
returning
he
thought
involuntarily
of
the
deep
sadness
of
the
kneeling
maiden
her
image
followed
him
to
his
hotel
and
remained
deeply
engraven
in
his
soul
don
vegal
found
in
his
saloon
the
jew
samuel
who
had
come
in
compliance
with
his
request
samuel
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
events
of
the
night
the
hope
of
gain
animated
his
countenance
with
a
natural
gayety
what
is
your
lordship
will
asked
he
of
the
spaniard
i
must
have
thirty
thousand
piasters
within
an
hour
thirty
thousand
piasters
and
who
has
them
by
the
holy
king
david
my
lord
i
am
far
from
being
able
to
furnish
such
a
sum
here
are
some
jewels
of
great
value
resumed
don
vegal
without
noticing
the
language
of
the
jew
besides
i
can
sell
you
at
a
low
price
a
considerable
estate
near
cusco
ah
señor
lands
ruin
us
we
have
not
arms
enough
left
to
cultivate
them
the
indians
have
withdrawn
to
the
mountains
and
our
harvests
do
not
pay
us
for
the
trouble
they
cost
at
what
value
do
you
estimate
these
diamonds
samuel
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
pair
of
scales
and
began
to
weigh
the
stones
with
scrupulous
skill
as
he
did
this
he
continued
to
talk
and
as
was
his
custom
depreciated
the
pledges
offered
him
diamonds
a
poor
investment
what
would
they
bring
one
might
as
well
bury
money
you
will
notice
señor
that
this
is
not
of
the
purest
water
do
you
know
that
i
do
not
find
a
ready
market
for
these
costly
ornaments
i
am
obliged
to
send
such
merchandise
to
the
united
provinces
the
americans
would
buy
them
undoubtedly
but
to
give
them
up
to
the
sons
of
albion
they
wish
besides
and
it
is
very
just
to
gain
an
honest
per
centage
so
that
the
depreciation
falls
upon
me
i
think
that
ten
thousand
piasters
should
satisfy
your
lordship
it
is
little
i
know
but
have
i
not
said
resumed
the
spaniard
with
a
sovereign
air
of
scorn
that
ten
thousand
piasters
would
not
suffice
señor
i
can
not
give
you
a
half
real
more
take
away
these
caskets
and
bring
me
the
sum
i
ask
for
to
complete
the
thirty
thousand
piasters
which
i
need
you
will
take
a
mortgage
on
this
house
does
it
seem
to
you
to
be
solid
ah
señor
in
this

he
said

times

instant

asked
the
jew
don
vegal
passed
into
the
adjoining
room
without
replying
proud
spaniard
muttered
samuel
i
will
crush
thy
insolence
as
i
disperse
thy
riches
by
solomon
i
am
a
skillful
man
since
my
interests
keep
pace
with
my
sentiments
don
vegal
on
leaving
the
jew
had
found
martin
paz
in
profound
dejection
of
spirits
mingled
with
mortification
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
affectionately
señor
it
is
the
daughter
of
the
jew
whom
i
love
a
jewess
exclaimed
don
vegal
with
disgust
but
seeing
the
sadness
of
the
indian
he
added
let
us
go
we
will
talk
of
these
things
afterward
an
hour
later
martin
paz
clad
in
spanish
costume
left
the
city
accompanied
by
don
vegal
who
took
none
of
his
people
with
him
the
baths
of
chorillos
are
situated
at
two
leagues
from
lima
this
indian
parish
possesses
a
pretty
church
during
the
hot
season
it
is
the
rendezvous
of
the
fashionable
limanian
society
public
games
interdicted
at
lima
are
permitted
at
chorillos
during
the
whole
summer
the
señoras
there
display
unwonted
ardor
and
in
decorating
himself
for
these
pretty
partners
more
than
one
rich
cavalier
has
seen
his
fortune
dissipated
in
a
few
nights
chorillos
was
still
little
frequented
so
don
vegal
and
martin
paz
retired
to
a
pretty
cottage
built
on
the
could
live
in
quiet
contemplation
of
the
vast
plains
of
the
pacific
ocean
the
marquis
don
vegal
belonging
to
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
of
peru
saw
about
to
terminate
in
himself
the
noble
line
of
which
he
was
justly
proud
so
his
countenance
bore
the
impress
of
profound
sadness
after
having
mingled
for
some
time
in
political
affairs
he
had
felt
an
inexpressible
disgust
for
the
incessant
revolutions
brought
about
to
gratify
personal
ambition
he
had
withdrawn
into
a
sort
of
solitude
interrupted
only
at
rare
intervals
by
the
duties
of
strict
politeness
his
immense
fortune
was
daily
diminishing
the
neglect
into
which
his
vast
domains
had
fallen
for
want
of
laborers
had
compelled
him
to
borrow
at
a
disadvantage
but
the
prospect
of
approaching
mediocrity
did
not
alarm
him
that
carelessness
natural
to
the
spanish
race
joined
to
the
ennui
of
a
useless
existence
had
rendered
him
insensible
to
the
menaces
of
the
future
formerly
the
husband
of
an
adored
wife
the
father
of
a
charming
little
girl
he
had
seen
himself
deprived
by
a
horrible
event
of
both
these
objects
of
his
love
since
then
no
bond
of
affection
had
attached
him
to
earth
and
he
suffered
his
life
to
float
at
the
will
of
events
don
vegal
had
thought
his
heart
to
be
indeed
dead
when
he
felt
it
palpitate
at
contact
with
that
of
martin
paz
this
ardent
nature
awoke
fire
beneath
the
ashes
the
proud
bearing
of
the
indian
suited
the
chivalric
hidalgo
and
then
weary
of
the
spanish
nobles
in
whom
he
no
longer
had
confidence
disgusted
with
the
selfish
mestizoes
who
wished
to
aggrandize
themselves
at
his
expense
he
took
a
pleasure
in
turning
to
that
primitive
race
who
have
disputed
so
valiantly
the
american
soil
with
the
soldiers
of
pizarro
according
to
the
intelligence
received
by
the
marquis
the
indian
passed
for
dead
at
lima
but
looking
on
his
attachment
for
the
jewess
as
worse
than
death
itself
the
spaniard
resolved
doubly
to
save
his
guest
by
leaving
the
daughter
of
samuel
to
marry
andré
certa
while
martin
paz
felt
an
infinite
sadness
pervade
his
heart
don
vegal
avoided
all
allusion
to
the
past
and
conversed
with
the
young
indian
on
indifferent
subjects
meanwhile
one
day
saddened
by
his
gloomy
preoccupations
the
spaniard
said
to
him
why
my
friend
do
you
lower
the
nobility
of
your
nature
by
a
sentiment
so
much
beneath
you
was
not
that
bold
whom
his
patriotism
placed
in
the
rank
of
heroes
your
ancestor
there
is
a
noble
part
left
for
a
valiant
man
who
will
not
suffer
himself
to
be
overcome
by
an
unworthy
passion
have
you
no
heart
to
regain
your
independence
we
are
laboring
for
this
señor
said
the
indian
and
the
day
when
my
brethren
shall
rise
is
perhaps
not
far
distant
i
understand
you
you
allude
to
the
war
for
which
your
brethren
are
preparing
among
their
mountains
at
a
signal
they
will
descend
on
the
city
arms
in
hand
and
will
be
conquered
as
they
have
always
been
see
how
your
interests
will
disappear
amid
these
perpetual
revolutions
of
which
peru
is
the
theatre
and
which
will
ruin
it
entirely
indians
and
spaniards
to
the
profit
of
the
mestizoes
who
are
neither
we
will
save
it
ourselves
exclaimed
martin
paz
yes
you
will
save
it
if
you
understand
how
to
play
your
part
listen
to
me
paz
you
whom
i
love
from
day
to
day
as
a
son
i
say
it
with
grief
but
we
spaniards
the
degenerate
sons
of
a
powerful
race
no
longer
have
the
energy
necessary
to
elevate
and
govern
a
state
it
is
therefore
yours
to
triumph
over
that
unhappy
americanism
which
tends
to
reject
european
colonization
yes
know
that
only
european
emigration
can
save
the
old
peruvian
empire
instead
of
this
intestine
war
which
tends
to
exclude
all
castes
with
the
exception
of
one
frankly
extend
your
hands
to
the
industrious
population
of
the
old
world
the
indians
señor
will
always
see
in
strangers
an
enemy
and
will
never
suffer
them
to
breathe
with
impunity
the
air
of
their
mountains
the
kind
of
dominion
which
i
exercise
over
them
will
be
without
effect
on
the
day
when
i
do
not
swear
death
to
their
oppressors
whoever
they
may
be
and
besides
what
am
i
now
added
martin
paz
with
great
sadness
a
fugitive
who
would
not
have
three
hours
to
live
in
the
streets
of
lima
paz
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
not
return
thither
how
can
i
promise
you
this
don
vegal
i
speak
only
the
truth
and
i
should
perjure
myself
were
i
to
take
an
oath
to
that
effect
don
vegal
was
silent
the
passion
of
the
young
indian
increased
from
day
to
day
the
marquis
trembled
to
see
him
incur
certain
death
by
at
lima
he
hastened
by
all
his
desires
he
would
have
hastened
by
all
his
efforts
the
marriage
of
the
jewess
to
ascertain
himself
the
state
of
things
he
quitted
chorillos
one
morning
returned
to
the
city
and
learned
that
andré
certa
had
recovered
from
his
wound
his
approaching
marriage
was
the
topic
of
general
conversation
don
vegal
wished
to
see
this
woman
whose
image
troubled
the
mind
of
martin
paz
he
repaired
at
evening
to
the
the
crowd
was
always
numerous
there
there
he
met
father
joachim
de
camarones
his
confessor
and
his
oldest
friend
he
acquainted
him
with
his
mode
of
life
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
good
father
to
learn
the
existence
of
martin
paz
he
promised
don
vegal
to
watch
also
himself
over
the
young
indian
and
to
convey
to
the
marquis
any
intelligence
of
importance
suddenly
the
glances
of
don
vegal
rested
on
a
young
girl
enveloped
in
a
black
mantle
reclining
in
a
calêche
who
is
that
beautiful
person
asked
he
of
the
father
it
is
the
betrothed
of
andré
certa
the
daughter
of
the
jew
samuel
she
the
daughter
of
the
jew
the
marquis
could
hardly
suppress
his
astonishment
and
pressing
the
hand
of
father
joachim
pensively
took
the
road
to
chorillos
he
had
just
recognized
in
sarah
the
pretended
jewess
the
young
girl
whom
he
had
seen
praying
with
such
christian
fervor
at
the
church
of
santa
anna
chapter
the
hatred
of
the
indians
since
the
colombian
troops
confided
by
bolivar
to
the
orders
of
general
santa
cruz
had
been
driven
from
lower
peru
this
country
which
had
been
incessantly
agitated
by
military
revolts
had
recovered
some
calmness
and
tranquillity
in
fact
private
ambition
no
longer
had
any
thing
to
expect
the
president
gambarra
seemed
immovable
in
his
palace
of
the
in
this
direction
there
was
nothing
to
fear
but
the
true
danger
concealed
imminent
was
not
from
these
rebellions
as
promptly
extinguished
as
kindled
and
which
seemed
to
flatter
the
taste
of
the
americans
for
military
parades
this
unknown
peril
escaped
the
eyes
of
the
spaniards
too
lofty
to
perceive
it
and
the
attention
of
the
mestizoes
who
never
wished
to
look
beneath
them
and
yet
there
was
an
unusual
agitation
among
the
indians
of
the
city
they
often
mingled
with
the
the
inhabitants
of
the
mountains
these
people
seemed
to
have
shaken
off
their
natural
apathy
instead
of
rolling
themselves
in
their
with
their
feet
turned
to
the
spring
sun
they
were
scattered
throughout
the
country
stopping
one
another
exchanging
private
signals
and
haunting
the
least
frequented
in
which
they
could
converse
without
danger
this
movement
was
principally
to
be
observed
on
one
of
the
squares
remote
from
the
centre
of
the
city
at
the
corner
of
a
street
stood
a
house
of
only
one
story
whose
wretched
appearance
struck
the
eye
disagreeably
a
tavern
of
the
lowest
order
a
kept
by
an
old
indian
woman
offered
to
the
lowest
the
beer
of
fermented
maize
and
the
a
beverage
made
of
the
the
concourse
of
indians
on
this
square
took
place
only
at
certain
hours
and
principally
when
a
long
pole
was
raised
on
the
roof
of
the
inn
as
a
signal
of
assemblage
then
the
of
every
profession
the
the
muleteers
the
carters
entered
the
one
by
one
and
immediately
disappeared
in
the
great
hall
the
hostess
seemed
very
busy
and
leaving
to
her
servant
the
care
of
the
shop
hastened
to
serve
herself
her
usual
customers
a
few
days
after
the
disappearance
of
martin
paz
there
was
a
numerous
assembly
in
the
hall
of
the
inn
one
could
scarcely
through
the
darkness
rendered
still
more
obscure
by
the
distinguish
the
frequenters
of
this
tavern
fifty
indians
were
ranged
around
a
long
table
some
were
chewing
the
a
kind
of
mingled
with
a
little
piece
of
fragrant
earth
called
others
were
drinking
from
large
pots
of
fermented
maize
but
these
occupations
did
not
distract
their
attention
and
they
were
closely
listening
to
the
speech
of
an
indian
this
was
the
sambo
whose
fixed
eyes
were
strangely
wild
he
was
clad
as
on
the
after
having
carefully
observed
his
auditors
the
sambo
commenced
in
these
terms
the
children
of
the
sun
can
converse
on
grave
affairs
there
is
no
perfidious
ear
to
hear
them
on
the
square
some
of
our
friends
disguised
as
will
attract
the
attention
of
the
and
we
shall
enjoy
entire
liberty
in
fact
the
tones
of
a
mandoline
and
of
a
were
echoing
without
the
indians
within
knowing
themselves
in
safety
lent
therefore
close
attention
to
the
words
of
the
sambo
in
whom
they
placed
entire
confidence
what
news
can
the
sambo
give
us
of
martin
paz
asked
an
indian
none
is
he
dead
or
not
the
great
spirit
only
knows
i
am
expecting
some
of
our
brethren
who
have
descended
the
river
to
its
mouth
perhaps
they
will
have
found
the
body
of
martin
paz
he
was
a
good
chief
said
manangani
a
ferocious
indian
much
dreaded
but
why
was
he
not
at
his
post
on
the
day
when
the
schooner
brought
us
arms
the
sambo
cast
down
his
head
without
reply
did
not
my
brethren
know
resumed
manangani
that
there
was
an
exchange
of
shots
between
the
and
the
officers
and
that
the
capture
of
the
vessel
would
have
ruined
our
projects
of
conspiracy
a
murmur
of
approbation
received
the
words
of
the
indian
those
of
my
brethren
who
will
wait
before
they
judge
will
be
the
beloved
of
my
heart
resumed
the
sambo
who
knows
whether
my
son
martin
paz
will
not
one
day
listen
now
the
arms
which
have
been
sent
us
from
sechura
are
in
our
power
they
are
concealed
in
the
mountains
of
the
cordilleras
and
ready
to
do
their
office
when
you
shall
be
prepared
to
do
your
duty
and
what
delays
us
said
a
young
indian
we
have
sharpened
our
knives
and
are
waiting
let
the
hour
come
said
the
sambo
do
my
brethren
know
what
enemy
their
arms
should
strike
first
those
mestizoes
who
treat
us
as
slaves
and
strike
us
with
the
hand
and
whip
like
restive
mules
these
are
the
monopolizers
of
the
riches
of
the
soil
who
will
not
suffer
us
to
purchase
a
little
comfort
for
our
old
age
you
are
mistaken
and
your
first
blows
must
be
struck
elsewhere
said
the
sambo
growing
animated
these
are
not
the
men
who
have
dared
for
three
hundred
years
past
to
tread
the
soil
of
our
ancestors
it
is
not
these
rich
men
gorged
with
gold
who
have
dragged
to
the
tomb
the
sons
of
no
it
is
these
proud
spaniards
whom
fate
has
thrust
on
our
independent
shores
these
are
the
true
conquerors
of
whom
you
are
the
true
slaves
if
they
have
no
longer
wealth
they
have
authority
and
in
spite
of
peruvian
emancipation
they
crush
and
trample
upon
our
natural
rights
let
us
forget
what
we
are
to
remember
what
our
fathers
have
been
anda
exclaimed
the
assembly
with
stamps
of
approbation
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
the
sambo
assured
himself
by
interrogating
various
conspirators
that
the
friends
of
cusco
and
of
all
bolivia
were
ready
to
strike
as
a
single
man
then
resuming
with
fire
and
our
brethren
of
the
mountains
brave
manangani
if
they
have
all
a
heart
of
hatred
equal
to
thine
a
courage
equal
to
thine
they
will
fall
on
lima
like
an
avalanche
from
the
summit
of
the
cordilleras
the
sambo
shall
not
complain
of
their
boldness
on
the
day
appointed
let
the
indian
leave
the
city
he
shall
not
go
far
without
seeing
throng
around
him
burning
for
vengeance
in
the
gorges
of
san
cristoval
and
the
amancaës
more
than
one
is
couched
on
his
with
his
poignard
at
his
girdle
waiting
until
a
long
carbine
shall
be
confided
to
his
skillful
hand
they
also
have
not
forgotten
that
they
have
to
revenge
on
the
vain
spaniards
the
defeat
of
well
said
manangani
it
is
the
god
of
hatred
who
speaks
from
thy
mouth
my
brethren
shall
know
before
long
him
whom
their
chiefs
have
chosen
to
lead
this
great
vengeance
president
gambarra
is
seeking
only
to
consolidate
his
power
bolivar
is
afar
santa
cruz
has
been
driven
away
we
can
act
with
certainty
in
a
few
days
the
fête
of
the
amancaës
will
summon
our
oppressors
to
pleasure
then
let
each
be
ready
to
march
and
let
the
news
be
carried
to
the
most
remote
villages
of
bolivia
at
this
moment
three
indians
entered
the
great
hall
the
sambo
hastened
to
meet
them
well
said
he
to
them
the
body
of
martin
paz
has
not
been
recovered
we
have
sounded
the
river
in
every
direction
our
most
skillful
divers
have
explored
it
with
religious
care
and
the
son
of
the
sambo
can
not
have
perished
in
the
waters
of
the
rimac
have
they
killed
him
what
has
become
of
him
oh
wo
wo
to
them
if
they
have
killed
my
son
let
my
brethren
separate
in
silence
let
each
return
to
his
post
look
watch
and
wait
the
indians
went
out
and
dispersed
the
sambo
alone
remained
with
manangani
who
asked
him
does
the
sambo
know
what
sentiment
conducted
his
son
to
san
lazaro
the
sambo
i
trust
is
sure
of
his
son
the
eyes
of
the
indian
flashed
and
the
blood
mounted
to
his
cheek
the
ferocious
manangani
recoiled
but
the
indian
controlled
himself
and
said
if
martin
paz
has
betrayed
his
brethren
i
will
first
kill
all
those
to
whom
he
has
given
his
friendship
all
those
to
whom
he
has
given
his
love
then
i
will
kill
him
and
myself
afterward
that
nothing
may
be
left
beneath
the
sun
of
an
infamous
and
dishonored
race
at
this
moment
the
opened
the
door
of
the
room
advanced
toward
the
sambo
and
handed
him
a
billet
directed
to
his
address
who
gave
you
this
said
he
i
do
not
know
this
paper
may
have
been
designedly
forgotten
by
a
i
found
it
on
the
table
have
there
been
any
but
indians
here
there
have
been
none
but
indians
the
went
out
the
sambo
unfolded
the
billet
and
read
aloud
a
young
girl
has
prayed
for
the
return
of
martin
paz
for
she
has
not
forgotten
that
the
young
indian
protected
her
and
risked
his
life
for
her
if
the
sambo
has
any
news
of
his
poor
son
or
any
hope
of
finding
him
let
him
surround
his
arm
with
a
red
handkerchief
there
are
eyes
which
see
him
pass
daily
the
sambo
crushed
the
billet
in
his
hand
the
unhappy
boy
said
he
has
suffered
himself
to
be
caught
by
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
is
this
woman
asked
manangani
it
is
not
an
indian
replied
the
sambo
observing
the
billet
it
is
some
young
girl
of
the
other
classes
martin
paz
i
no
longer
know
thee
shall
you
do
what
this
woman
requests
no
replied
the
indian
violently
let
her
lose
all
hope
of
seeing
him
again
let
her
die
if
she
will
and
the
sambo
tore
the
billet
in
a
rage
it
must
have
been
an
indian
who
brought
this
billet
observed
manangani
oh
it
can
not
have
been
one
of
ours
he
must
have
known
that
i
often
came
to
this
inn
but
i
will
set
my
foot
in
it
no
more
we
have
occupied
ourselves
long
enough
with
trifling
affairs
resumed
he
coldly
let
my
brother
return
to
the
mountains
i
will
remain
to
watch
over
the
city
we
shall
see
whether
the
fête
of
the
amancaës
will
be
joyous
for
the
oppressors
or
the
oppressed
the
two
indians
separated
the
plan
of
the
conspiracy
was
well
conceived
and
the
hour
of
its
execution
well
chosen
peru
almost
depopulated
counted
only
a
small
number
of
spaniards
and
mestizoes
the
invasion
of
the
indians
gathered
from
every
direction
from
the
forests
of
brazil
as
well
as
the
mountains
of
chili
and
the
plains
of
la
plata
would
cover
the
theatre
of
war
with
a
formidable
army
the
great
cities
like
lima
cusco
puña
might
be
utterly
destroyed
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
colombian
troops
so
recently
driven
away
by
the
peruvian
government
would
come
to
the
assistance
of
their
enemies
in
peril
this
social
overturn
might
therefore
have
succeeded
if
the
secret
had
remained
buried
in
the
hearts
of
the
indians
and
there
surely
could
not
be
traitors
among
them
but
they
were
ignorant
that
a
man
had
obtained
private
audience
of
the
president
gambarra
this
man
informed
him
that
the
schooner
had
been
captured
from
him
by
indian
pirates
that
it
had
been
laden
with
arms
of
all
sorts
that
canoes
had
unloaded
it
at
the
mouth
of
the
rimac
and
he
claimed
a
high
indemnity
for
the
service
he
thus
rendered
to
the
peruvian
government
and
yet
this
man
had
let
his
vessel
to
the
agents
of
the
sambo
he
had
received
for
it
a
considerable
sum
and
had
come
to
sell
the
secret
which
he
had
surprised
by
these
traits
the
reader
will
recognize
the
jew
samuel
chapter
vi
the
betrothal
andré
certa
entirely
recovered
sure
of
the
death
of
martin
paz
pressed
his
marriage
he
was
impatient
to
parade
the
young
and
beautiful
jewess
through
the
streets
of
lima
sarah
constantly
manifested
toward
him
a
haughty
indifference
but
he
cared
not
for
it
considering
her
as
an
article
of
sale
for
which
he
had
paid
a
hundred
thousand
piasters
and
yet
andré
certa
suspected
the
jew
and
with
good
reason
if
the
contract
was
dishonorable
the
contractors
were
still
more
so
so
the
mestizo
wished
to
have
a
secret
interview
with
samuel
and
took
him
one
day
to
the
baths
of
chorillos
he
was
not
sorry
besides
to
try
the
chances
of
play
before
his
wedding
public
gaming
prohibited
at
lima
is
perfectly
tolerated
elsewhere
the
passion
of
the
limanian
ladies
and
gentlemen
for
this
hazardous
amusement
is
singular
and
irresistible
the
games
were
open
some
days
before
the
arrival
of
the
marquis
don
vegal
thenceforth
there
was
a
perpetual
movement
of
the
populace
on
the
road
from
lima
some
came
on
foot
who
returned
in
carriages
others
were
about
to
risk
and
lose
the
last
remnants
of
their
fortunes
don
vegal
and
martin
paz
took
no
part
in
these
exciting
pleasures
the
reveries
of
the
young
indian
had
more
noble
causes
he
was
thinking
of
sarah
and
of
his
benefactor
the
concourse
of
the
limanians
to
the
baths
of
chorillos
was
without
danger
for
him
little
known
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
like
all
the
mountain
indians
he
easily
concealed
himself
from
all
eyes
after
his
evening
walk
with
the
marquis
martin
paz
would
return
to
his
room
and
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
window
pass
long
hours
in
allowing
his
tumultuous
thoughts
to
wander
over
the
pacific
ocean
don
vegal
lodged
in
a
neighboring
chamber
and
guarded
him
with
paternal
tenderness
the
spaniard
always
remembered
the
daughter
of
samuel
whom
he
had
so
unexpectedly
seen
at
prayer
in
the
catholic
temple
but
he
had
not
dared
to
confide
this
important
secret
to
martin
paz
while
instructing
him
by
degrees
in
christian
truths
he
feared
to
sentiments
which
he
wished
to
extinguish
for
the
poor
indian
unknown
and
proscribed
must
renounce
all
hope
of
happiness
father
joachim
kept
don
vegal
informed
of
the
progress
of
affairs
the
police
had
at
last
ceased
to
trouble
themselves
about
martin
paz
and
with
time
and
the
influence
of
his
protector
the
indian
become
a
man
of
merit
and
capable
of
great
things
might
one
day
take
rank
in
the
highest
peruvian
society
weary
of
the
uncertainty
into
which
his
incognito
plunged
him
paz
resolved
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
young
jewess
thanks
to
his
spanish
costume
he
could
glide
into
a
and
listen
to
the
conversation
of
its
various
frequenters
andré
certa
was
a
man
of
so
much
importance
that
his
marriage
if
it
was
approaching
would
be
the
subject
of
conversation
one
evening
instead
of
directing
his
steps
toward
the
sea
the
indian
climbed
over
the
high
rocks
on
which
the
principal
habitations
of
chorillos
are
built
a
house
fronted
by
broad
stone
steps
struck
his
eyes
he
entered
it
without
noise
the
day
had
been
hard
for
many
of
the
wealthy
limanians
some
among
them
exhausted
with
the
fatigues
of
the
preceding
night
were
reposing
on
the
ground
wrapped
in
their
other
players
were
seated
before
a
large
green
table
divided
into
four
compartments
by
two
lines
which
intersected
each
other
at
the
centre
in
right
angles
on
each
of
these
compartments
were
the
first
letters
of
the
words
and
chance
and
fate
a
and
at
this
moment
the
parties
of
the
were
animated
a
mestizo
was
pursuing
the
unfavorable
chance
with
feverish
ardor
two
thousand
piasters
exclaimed
he
the
banker
shook
the
dice
and
the
player
burst
into
imprecations
four
thousand
piasters
said
he
again
and
he
lost
once
more
martin
paz
protected
by
the
obscurity
of
the
saloon
could
look
the
player
in
the
face
and
he
turned
pale
it
was
andré
certa
near
him
was
standing
the
jew
samuel
you
have
played
enough
señor
andré
said
samuel
to
him
the
luck
is
not
for
you
what
business
is
it
of
yours
replied
the
mestizo
roughly
samuel
bent
down
to
his
ear
if
it
is
not
my
business
it
is
your
business
to
break
off
these
habits
during
the
days
which
precede
your
marriage
eight
thousand
piasters
resumed
andré
certa
he
lost
again
the
mestizo
suppressed
a
curse
and
the
banker
resumed
play
on
andré
certa
drawing
from
his
pocket
some
bills
was
about
to
have
hazarded
a
considerable
sum
he
had
even
deposited
it
on
one
of
the
tables
and
the
banker
shaking
his
dice
was
about
to
have
decided
its
fate
when
a
sign
from
samuel
stopped
him
short
the
jew
bent
again
to
the
ear
of
the
mestizo
and
said
if
nothing
remains
to
you
to
conclude
our
bargain
it
shall
be
broken
off
this
evening
andré
certa
shrugged
his
shoulders
took
up
his
money
and
went
out
continue
now
said
samuel
to
the
banker
you
may
ruin
this
gentleman
after
his
marriage
the
banker
bowed
submissively
the
jew
samuel
was
the
founder
and
proprietor
of
the
games
of
chorillos
wherever
there
was
a
to
be
made
this
man
was
to
be
met
with
he
followed
the
mestizo
and
finding
him
on
the
stone
steps
said
to
him
i
have
secrets
of
importance
to
communicate
where
can
we
converse
in
safety
wherever
you
please
replied
certa
roughly
señor
let
not
your
passions
ruin
your
prospects
i
would
neither
confide
my
secret
to
the
most
carefully
closed
chambers
nor
the
most
lonely
plains
if
you
pay
me
dearly
for
it
it
is
because
it
is
worth
telling
and
worth
keeping
as
they
spoke
thus
these
two
men
had
reached
the
sea
near
the
cabins
destined
for
the
use
of
the
bathers
they
knew
not
that
they
were
seen
heard
and
watched
by
martin
paz
who
glided
like
a
serpent
in
the
shadow
let
us
take
a
canoe
said
andré
and
go
out
into
the
open
sea
the
sharks
may
perhaps
show
themselves
discreet
andré
detached
from
the
shore
a
little
boat
and
threw
some
money
to
its
guardian
samuel
embarked
with
him
and
the
mestizo
pushed
off
he
vigorously
plied
two
flexible
oars
which
soon
took
them
a
mile
from
the
shore
but
as
he
saw
the
canoe
put
off
martin
paz
concealed
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
hastily
undressed
and
precipitating
himself
into
the
sea
swam
vigorously
toward
the
boat
the
sun
had
just
buried
his
last
rays
in
the
waves
of
the
ocean
and
darkness
hovered
over
the
crests
of
the
waves
martin
paz
had
not
once
reflected
that
sharks
of
the
most
dangerous
species
frequented
these
fatal
shores
he
stopped
not
far
from
the
boat
of
the
mestizo
and
listened
what
proof
of
the
identity
of
the
daughter
shall
i
carry
to
the
father
asked
andré
certa
of
the
jew
you
will
recall
to
him
the
circumstances
under
which
he
lost
her
what
were
these
circumstances
martin
paz
now
scarcely
above
the
waves
listened
without
understanding
in
a
girdle
attached
to
his
body
he
had
a
poignard
he
waited
her
father
said
the
jew
lived
at
concencion
in
chili
he
was
then
the
great
nobleman
he
is
now
only
his
fortune
equalled
his
nobility
obliged
to
come
to
lima
on
business
he
set
out
alone
leaving
at
concencion
his
wife
and
child
aged
fifteen
months
the
climate
of
peru
agreed
with
him
and
he
sent
for
the
marchioness
to
rejoin
him
she
embarked
on
the
of
valparaiso
with
her
confidential
servants
i
was
going
to
peru
in
the
same
ship
the
was
about
to
enter
the
harbor
of
lima
but
near
juan
fernandez
was
struck
by
a
terrific
hurricane
which
disabled
her
and
threw
her
on
her
side
it
was
the
affair
of
half
an
hour
the
filled
with
water
and
was
slowly
sinking
the
passengers
and
crew
took
refuge
in
the
boat
but
at
sight
of
the
furious
waves
the
marchioness
refused
to
enter
it
she
pressed
her
infant
in
her
arms
and
remained
in
the
ship
i
remained
with
her
the
boat
was
swallowed
up
at
a
hundred
fathoms
from
the
with
all
her
crew
we
were
alone
the
tempest
blew
with
increasing
violence
as
my
fortune
was
not
on
board
i
had
nothing
to
lose
the
having
five
feet
of
water
in
her
hold
drifted
on
the
rocks
of
the
shore
where
she
broke
to
pieces
the
young
woman
was
thrown
into
the
sea
with
her
daughter
fortunately
for
me
said
the
jew
with
a
gloomy
smile
i
could
seize
the
child
and
reach
the
shore
with
it
all
these
details
are
exact
perfectly
so
the
father
will
recognize
them
i
had
done
a
good
work
señor
since
she
is
worth
to
me
the
hundred
thousand
piasters
which
you
are
about
to
pay
me
now
let
the
marriage
take
place
what
does
this
mean
asked
martin
paz
of
himself
still
swimming
in
the
shadow
here
is
my
with
the
hundred
thousand
piasters
take
it
master
samuel
replied
andré
certa
to
the
jew
thanks
señor
andré
said
the
israelite
seizing
the
treasure
take
this
receipt
in
exchange
i
pledge
myself
to
restore
you
double
this
sum
if
you
do
not
become
a
member
of
one
of
the
proudest
families
of
spain
but
the
indian
had
not
heard
this
last
sentence
he
had
dived
to
avoid
the
approach
of
the
boat
and
his
eyes
could
see
a
shapeless
mass
gliding
rapidly
toward
him
he
thought
it
was
the
canoe
he
was
mistaken
it
was
a
a
shark
of
the
most
ferocious
species
martin
paz
did
not
quail
or
he
would
have
been
lost
the
animal
approached
him
the
indian
dived
but
he
was
obliged
to
come
up
in
order
to
breathe
he
looked
at
the
sky
as
if
he
was
never
to
behold
it
again
the
stars
sparkled
above
his
head
the
continued
to
approach
a
vigorous
blow
with
his
tail
struck
the
swimmer
martin
paz
felt
his
slimy
scales
brush
his
breast
the
shark
in
order
to
snatch
at
him
turned
on
his
back
and
opened
his
jaws
armed
with
a
triple
row
of
teeth
martin
paz
saw
the
white
belly
of
the
animal
gleam
beneath
the
wave
and
with
a
rapid
hand
struck
it
with
his
poignard
suddenly
he
found
the
waters
around
him
red
with
blood
he
dived
came
up
again
at
ten
fathoms
distance
thought
of
the
daughter
of
samuel
and
seeing
nothing
more
of
the
boat
of
the
mestizo
regained
the
shore
in
a
few
strokes
already
forgetting
that
he
had
just
escaped
death
he
quickly
rejoined
don
vegal
the
latter
not
having
found
him
on
his
return
was
anxiously
awaiting
him
paz
made
no
allusion
to
his
recent
adventures
but
seemed
to
take
a
lively
pleasure
in
his
conversation
but
the
next
day
martin
paz
had
left
chorillos
and
don
vegal
tortured
with
anxiety
hastily
returned
to
lima
the
marriage
of
andré
certa
with
the
daughter
of
the
wealthy
samuel
was
an
important
event
the
beautiful
señoras
had
not
given
themselves
a
moment
rest
they
had
exhausted
their
ingenuity
to
invent
some
pretty
corsage
or
novel
they
had
wearied
themselves
in
trying
without
cessation
the
most
varied
toilets
numerous
preparations
were
also
going
on
in
the
house
of
samuel
it
was
a
part
of
the
jew
plan
to
give
great
publicity
to
the
marriage
of
sarah
the
frescoes
which
adorned
his
dwelling
according
to
the
spanish
custom
had
been
newly
painted
the
richest
hangings
fell
in
large
folds
at
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
habitation
furniture
carved
in
the
latest
fashion
of
precious
or
fragrant
wood
was
crowded
in
vast
saloons
impregnated
with
a
delicious
coolness
rare
shrubs
the
productions
of
warm
countries
seized
the
eye
with
their
splendid
colors
and
one
would
have
thought
spring
had
stolen
along
the
balconies
and
terraces
to
inundate
them
with
flowers
and
perfumes
meanwhile
amid
these
smiling
marvels
the
young
girl
was
weeping
sarah
no
longer
had
hope
since
the
sambo
had
none
and
the
sambo
had
no
hope
since
he
wore
no
sign
of
hope
the
negro
liberta
had
watched
the
steps
of
the
old
indian
he
had
seen
nothing
ah
if
the
poor
child
could
have
followed
the
impulses
of
her
heart
she
would
have
immured
herself
in
one
of
those
tranquil
to
die
there
amid
tears
and
prayer
urged
by
an
irresistible
attraction
to
the
doctrines
of
catholicism
the
young
jewess
had
been
secretly
converted
by
the
cares
of
the
good
father
joachim
she
had
been
won
over
to
a
religion
more
in
accordance
with
her
feelings
than
that
in
which
she
had
been
educated
if
samuel
had
destined
her
for
a
jew
she
would
have
avowed
her
faith
but
about
to
espouse
a
catholic
she
reserved
for
her
husband
the
secret
of
her
conversion
father
joachim
in
order
to
avoid
scandal
and
besides
better
read
in
his
breviary
than
in
the
human
heart
had
suffered
sarah
to
believe
in
the
death
of
martin
paz
the
conversion
of
the
young
girl
was
the
most
important
thing
to
him
he
saw
it
assured
by
her
union
with
andré
certa
and
he
sought
to
accustom
her
to
the
idea
of
this
marriage
the
conditions
of
which
he
was
far
from
respecting
at
last
the
day
so
joyous
for
some
so
sad
for
others
had
arrived
andré
certa
had
invited
the
entire
city
to
his
nuptials
his
invitations
were
refused
by
the
noble
families
who
excused
themselves
on
various
pretexts
the
mestizo
meanwhile
proudly
held
up
his
head
and
scarcely
looked
at
those
of
his
own
class
the
little
milleflores
in
vain
essayed
his
humblest
vows
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
was
about
to
figure
as
an
active
party
in
the
repast
which
was
to
follow
in
the
meantime
the
young
mestizoes
were
discoursing
with
him
in
the
brilliant
saloons
of
the
jew
and
the
crowd
of
guests
thronged
around
andré
certa
who
proudly
displayed
the
splendors
of
his
toilet
the
contract
was
soon
to
be
signed
the
sun
had
long
been
set
and
the
young
girl
had
not
appeared
doubtless
she
was
discussing
with
her
duenna
and
her
maids
the
place
of
a
ribbon
or
the
choice
of
an
ornament
perhaps
that
enchanting
timidity
which
so
beautifully
adorns
the
cheeks
of
a
young
girl
detained
her
still
from
their
inquisitive
regards
the
jew
samuel
seemed
a
prey
to
secret
uneasiness
andré
certa
bent
his
brow
in
an
impatient
manner
a
sort
of
embarrassment
was
depicted
on
the
countenance
of
more
than
one
guest
while
the
thousand
of
reflected
by
the
mirrors
filled
the
saloon
with
dazzling
splendor
without
a
man
was
wandering
in
mortal
anxiety
it
was
the
marquis
don
vegal
chapter
vii
all
interests
at
stake
meanwhile
sarah
was
left
alone
alone
with
her
anguish
and
her
grief
she
was
about
to
give
up
her
whole
life
to
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
she
leaned
over
the
perfumed
balcony
of
her
chamber
which
overlooked
the
interior
gardens
through
the
green
jalousies
her
ear
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
slumbering
country
her
lace
mantle
gliding
over
her
arms
revealed
a
profusion
of
diamonds
sparkling
on
her
shoulders
her
sorrow
proud
and
majestic
appeared
through
all
her
ornaments
and
she
might
have
been
taken
for
one
of
those
beautiful
greek
slaves
nobly
draped
in
their
antique
garments
suddenly
her
glance
rested
on
a
man
who
was
gliding
silently
among
the
avenues
of
the
magnolia
she
recognized
him
it
was
liberta
her
servant
he
seemed
to
be
watching
some
invisible
enemy
now
sheltering
himself
behind
a
statue
now
crouching
on
the
ground
sarah
was
afraid
and
looked
around
her
she
was
alone
entirely
alone
her
eyes
rested
on
the
gardens
and
she
became
pale
paler
still
before
her
was
transpiring
a
terrible
scene
liberta
was
in
the
grasp
of
a
man
of
tall
stature
who
had
thrown
him
down
stifled
sighs
proved
that
a
robust
hand
was
pressing
the
lips
of
the
indian
the
young
girl
summoning
all
her
courage
was
about
to
cry
out
when
she
saw
the
two
men
rise
the
negro
was
looking
fixedly
at
his
adversary
it
is
you
then
it
is
you
exclaimed
he
and
he
followed
this
man
in
a
strange
stupefaction
they
arrived
beneath
the
balcony
of
sarah
suddenly
before
she
had
time
to
utter
a
cry
martin
paz
appeared
to
her
like
a
phantom
from
another
world
and
like
the
negro
when
overthrown
by
the
indian
the
young
girl
bending
before
the
glance
of
martin
paz
could
in
her
turn
only
repeat
these
words
it
is
you
then
it
is
you
the
young
indian
fixed
on
her
his
motionless
eyes
and
said
does
the
betrothed
hear
the
sound
of
the
festival
the
guests
are
thronging
into
the
saloons
to
see
happiness
radiate
from
her
countenance
is
it
then
a
victim
prepared
for
the
sacrifice
who
is
about
to
present
herself
to
their
impatient
eyes
is
it
with
these
features
pale
with
sorrow
with
eyes
in
which
sparkle
bitter
tears
that
the
young
girl
is
to
appear
herself
before
her
betrothed
martin
paz
spoke
thus
in
a
tone
full
of
sympathizing
sadness
and
sarah
listened
vaguely
as
to
those
harmonies
which
we
hear
in
dreams
the
young
indian
resumed
with
infinite
sweetness
since
the
soul
of
the
young
girl
is
in
mourning
let
her
look
beyond
the
house
of
her
father
beyond
the
city
where
she
suffers
and
weeps
beyond
the
mountains
the
lift
up
their
heads
in
freedom
the
birds
strike
the
air
with
an
independent
wing
men
have
immensity
to
live
in
and
the
young
girls
may
unfold
their
spirits
and
their
hearts
sarah
raised
her
head
toward
martin
paz
the
indian
had
drawn
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
with
his
arm
extended
toward
the
summits
of
the
cordilleras
was
pointing
out
to
the
young
girl
the
path
to
liberty
sarah
felt
herself
constrained
by
an
irresistible
force
already
the
sound
of
voices
reached
her
they
approached
her
chamber
her
father
was
undoubtedly
about
to
enter
perhaps
her
lover
would
accompany
him
the
indian
suddenly
extinguished
the
lamp
suspended
above
his
head
a
whistling
similar
to
the
cry
of
the
and
reminding
one
of
that
heard
on
the
pierced
the
silent
darkness
of
night
the
young
girl
swooned
the
door
opened
hastily
samuel
and
andré
certa
entered
the
darkness
was
profound
some
servants
ran
with
torches
the
chamber
was
empty
death
and
fury
exclaimed
the
mestizo
where
is
she
asked
samuel
you
are
responsible
for
her
said
andré
brutally
at
these
words
the
jew
felt
a
cold
sweat
freeze
even
his
bones
help
help
he
exclaimed
and
followed
by
his
domestics
he
sprang
out
of
the
house
martin
paz
fled
rapidly
through
the
streets
of
the
city
the
negro
liberta
followed
him
but
did
not
appear
disposed
to
dispute
with
him
the
possession
of
the
young
girl
at
two
hundred
paces
from
the
dwelling
of
the
jew
paz
found
some
indians
of
his
companions
who
had
assembled
at
the
whistle
uttered
by
him
to
our
mountain
exclaimed
he
to
the
house
of
the
marquis
don
vegal
said
another
voice
behind
him
martin
paz
turned
the
spaniard
was
at
his
side
will
you
not
confide
this
young
girl
to
me
asked
the
marquis
the
indian
bent
his
head
and
said
in
a
low
voice
to
his
companions
to
the
dwelling
of
the
marquis
don
vegal
they
turned
their
steps
in
this
direction
an
extreme
confusion
reigned
then
in
the
saloons
of
the
jew
the
news
of
sarah
disappearance
was
a
thunderbolt
the
friends
of
andré
hastened
to
follow
him
the
of
san
lazaro
was
explored
hastily
searched
but
nothing
could
be
discovered
samuel
tore
his
hair
in
despair
during
the
whole
night
the
most
active
research
was
useless
martin
paz
is
living
exclaimed
andré
certa
in
a
moment
of
fury
and
the
presentiment
quickly
acquired
confirmation
the
police
were
immediately
informed
of
the
elopement
its
most
active
agents
bestirred
themselves
the
indians
were
closely
watched
and
if
the
retreat
of
the
young
girl
was
not
discovered
evident
proofs
of
an
approaching
revolt
came
to
light
which
accorded
with
the
denunciations
of
the
jew
andré
certa
lavished
gold
freely
but
could
learn
nothing
meanwhile
the
declared
that
they
had
seen
no
person
leave
lima
the
young
girl
must
therefore
be
concealed
in
the
city
liberta
who
returned
to
his
master
was
often
interrogated
but
no
person
seemed
more
astonished
than
himself
at
the
elopement
of
sarah
meanwhile
one
man
besides
andré
certa
had
seen
in
the
disappearance
of
the
young
jewess
a
proof
of
the
existence
of
martin
paz
it
was
the
sambo
he
was
wandering
in
the
streets
of
lima
when
the
cry
uttered
by
the
indian
fixed
his
attention
it
was
a
signal
of
rally
well
known
to
him
the
sambo
was
therefore
a
spectator
of
the
capture
of
the
young
girl
and
followed
her
to
the
dwelling
of
the
marquis
the
spaniard
entered
by
a
secret
door
of
which
he
alone
had
the
key
so
that
his
domestics
suspected
nothing
martin
paz
carried
the
young
girl
in
his
arms
and
laid
her
on
a
bed
when
don
vegal
who
had
returned
to
by
the
principal
door
reached
the
chamber
where
sarah
was
reposing
he
found
martin
paz
kneeling
beside
her
the
marquis
was
about
to
reproach
the
indian
with
his
conduct
when
the
latter
said
to
him
you
see
my
father
whether
i
love
you
ah
why
did
you
throw
yourself
in
my
way
we
should
have
been
already
free
in
our
mountains
but
how
should
i
not
have
obeyed
your
words
don
vegal
knew
not
what
to
reply
his
heart
was
seized
with
a
powerful
emotion
he
felt
how
much
he
was
beloved
by
martin
paz
the
day
on
which
sarah
shall
quit
your
dwelling
to
be
restored
to
her
father
and
her
betrothed
sighed
the
indian
you
will
have
a
son
and
a
friend
less
in
the
world
as
he
said
these
last
words
paz
moistened
with
his
tears
the
hand
of
don
vegal
they
were
the
first
tears
this
man
had
shed
the
reproaches
of
don
vegal
died
away
before
this
respectful
submission
the
young
girl
had
become
his
guest
she
was
sacred
he
could
not
help
admiring
sarah
still
in
a
swoon
he
was
prepared
to
love
her
of
whose
conversion
he
had
been
a
witness
and
whom
he
would
have
been
pleased
to
bestow
as
a
companion
upon
the
young
indian
it
was
then
that
on
opening
her
eyes
sarah
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
where
am
i
said
she
with
a
sentiment
of
terror
with
a
generous
man
who
has
permitted
me
to
call
him
my
father
replied
martin
paz
pointing
to
the
spaniard
the
young
girl
restored
by
the
voice
of
the
indian
to
a
consciousness
of
her
position
covered
her
face
with
her
trembling
hands
and
began
to
sob
withdraw
friend
said
don
vegal
to
the
young
man
withdraw
martin
paz
slowly
left
the
room
not
without
having
pressed
the
hand
of
the
spaniard
and
cast
on
sarah
a
lingering
look
then
don
vegal
bestowed
upon
this
poor
child
consolations
of
exquisite
delicacy
he
conveyed
in
suitable
language
his
sentiments
of
nobility
and
honor
attentive
and
resigned
the
young
girl
comprehended
what
danger
she
had
escaped
and
she
confided
her
future
happiness
to
the
care
of
the
spaniard
but
amid
phrases
interrupted
by
sighs
and
mingled
with
tears
don
vegal
perceived
the
intense
attachment
of
this
simple
heart
for
him
whom
she
called
her
deliverer
he
induced
sarah
to
take
some
repose
and
watched
over
her
with
the
solicitude
of
a
father
martin
paz
comprehended
the
duties
that
honor
required
of
him
and
in
spite
of
perils
and
dangers
would
not
pass
the
night
beneath
the
roof
of
don
vegal
he
therefore
went
out
his
head
was
burning
his
blood
was
boiling
with
fever
in
his
veins
he
had
not
gone
a
hundred
paces
in
the
street
when
five
or
six
men
threw
themselves
upon
him
and
notwithstanding
his
obstinate
defense
succeeded
in
binding
him
martin
paz
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
which
was
lost
in
the
night
he
believed
himself
in
the
power
of
his
enemies
and
gave
a
last
thought
to
the
young
girl
a
short
time
afterward
the
indian
was
deposited
in
a
room
the
bandage
which
had
covered
his
eyes
was
taken
off
he
looked
around
him
and
saw
himself
in
the
lower
hall
of
that
tavern
where
his
brethren
had
organized
their
approaching
revolt
the
sambo
manangani
and
others
surrounded
him
a
gleam
of
indignation
flashed
from
his
eyes
which
was
reciprocated
by
his
captors
my
son
had
then
no
pity
on
my
tears
said
the
sambo
since
he
suffered
me
for
so
long
a
time
to
believe
in
his
death
is
it
on
the
eve
before
a
revolt
that
martin
paz
our
chief
should
be
found
in
the
camp
of
our
enemies
martin
paz
replied
neither
to
his
father
nor
to
manangani
so
our
most
important
interests
have
been
sacrificed
to
a
woman
as
he
spoke
thus
manangani
had
approached
martin
paz
a
poignard
was
gleaming
in
his
hand
martin
paz
did
not
even
look
at
him
let
us
first
speak
said
the
sambo
we
will
act
afterward
if
my
son
fails
to
conduct
his
brethren
to
the
combat
i
shall
know
now
on
whom
to
avenge
his
treason
let
him
take
care
the
daughter
of
the
jew
samuel
is
not
so
well
concealed
that
she
can
escape
our
hatred
my
son
will
reflect
struck
with
a
mortal
condemnation
proscribed
wandering
among
our
masters
he
will
not
have
a
stone
on
which
to
rest
his
sorrows
if
on
the
contrary
we
resume
our
ancient
country
and
our
ancient
power
martin
paz
the
chief
of
numerous
tribes
may
bestow
upon
his
betrothed
both
happiness
and
glory
martin
paz
remained
silent
but
a
terrific
conflict
was
going
on
within
him
the
sambo
had
roused
the
most
sensitive
chords
of
his
proud
nature
to
vibrate
placed
between
a
life
of
fatigues
of
dangers
of
despair
and
an
existence
happy
honored
illustrious
he
could
not
hesitate
but
should
he
then
abandon
the
marquis
don
vegal
whose
noble
hopes
destined
him
as
the
deliverer
of
peru
oh
thought
he
as
he
looked
at
his
father
they
will
kill
sarah
if
i
forsake
them
what
does
my
son
reply
to
us
imperiously
demanded
the
sambo
that
martin
paz
is
indispensable
to
your
projects
that
he
enjoys
a
supreme
authority
over
the
indians
of
the
city
that
he
leads
them
at
his
will
and
at
a
sign
could
have
them
dragged
to
death
he
must
therefore
resume
his
place
in
the
revolt
in
order
to
ensure
victory
the
bonds
which
still
enchained
him
were
detached
by
order
of
the
sambo
martin
paz
arose
free
among
his
brethren
my
son
said
the
indian
who
was
observing
him
attentively
during
the
fête
of
the
amancaës
our
brethren
will
fall
like
an
avalanche
on
the
unarmed
limanians
there
is
the
road
to
the
cordilleras
there
is
the
road
to
the
city
you
will
go
wherever
your
good
pleasure
shall
lead
you
you
will
find
more
than
one
mestizo
breast
to
break
your
poignard
against
you
are
free
to
the
mountains
exclaimed
martin
paz
with
a
stern
voice
the
indian
had
again
become
an
indian
amid
the
hatred
which
surrounded
him
to
the
mountains
repeated
he
and
wo
to
our
enemies
wo
and
the
rising
sun
illumined
with
its
earliest
rays
the
council
of
the
indian
chiefs
in
the
heart
of
the
cordilleras
these
rays
were
joyless
to
the
heart
of
the
poor
young
girl
who
wept
and
prayed
the
marquis
had
summoned
father
joachim
and
the
worthy
man
had
there
met
his
beloved
penitent
what
happiness
was
it
for
her
to
kneel
at
the
feet
of
the
old
priest
and
to
pour
out
her
anguish
and
her
afflictions
but
sarah
could
not
longer
remain
in
the
dwelling
of
the
spaniard
father
joachim
suggested
this
to
don
vegal
who
knew
not
what
part
to
take
for
he
was
a
prey
to
extreme
anxiety
what
had
become
of
martin
paz
he

enjoyed
an
admirable

mingled
in

was
preceded
by

these
joyous
promenaders
advanced
with
cries

endless
jests
through
the
fields
of
maize
and
of
through
the
groves
of

whose
fruits
hung
to
the

they
traversed
those
beautiful
planted
with
willows
and
forests
of

whose
intoxicating
perfumes
were
mingled
with

of
the
dancers
the
musicians
uttered
wild
cries
which
stimulated
them
to
delirium
the

beat
the

sunk

there
reigned
in
this
fête
which
derives
its
name
from
the

inconceivable
transport
and
freedom
and
yet
no

mingled
among

while
they
fearlessly
enjoyed

and
were
giving

up

a

drama
was
preparing

chapter
viii
conquerors
and
conquered
a
prey
to
his
blind
grief
don
vegal
walked
at
random
after
having
lost
his
daughter
the
hope
of
his
race
and
of
his
love
was
he
about
to
see
himself
also
deprived
of
the
child
of
his
adoption
whom
he
had
wrested
from
death
don
vegal
had
forgotten
sarah
to
think
only
of
martin
paz
he
was
struck
with
the
great
number
of
indians
of
of
who
were
wandering
about
the
streets
these
men
who
usually
took
an
active
part
in
the
sports
of
the
amancaës
were
now
walking
silently
with
singular
often
some
busy
chief
gave
them
a
secret
order
and
went
on
his
way
and
all
notwithstanding
their
were
assembling
by
degrees
in
the
wealthiest
quarters
of
lima
in
proportion
as
the
limanians
were
scattered
abroad
in
the
country
don
vegal
absorbed
in
his
own
researches
soon
forgot
this
singular
state
of
things
he
traversed
san
lazaro
throughout
saw
andré
certa
there
enraged
and
armed
and
the
jew
samuel
in
the
extremity
of
distress
not
for
the
loss
of
his
daughter
but
for
the
loss
of
his
hundred
thousand
piasters
but
he
found
not
martin
paz
whom
he
was
impatiently
seeking
he
ran
to
the
consistorial
prison
nothing
he
returned
home
nothing
he
mounted
his
horse
and
hastened
to
chorillos
nothing
he
returned
at
last
exhausted
with
fatigue
to
lima
the
clock
of
the
cathedral
was
striking
four
don
vegal
remarked
some
groups
of
indians
before
his
dwelling
but
he
could
not
without
compromising
the
man
of
whom
he
was
in
search
ask
them
where
is
martin
paz
he
more
despairing
than
ever
immediately
a
man
emerged
from
a
neighboring
alley
and
came
directly
to
the
indians
this
man
was
the
sambo
the
spaniard
has
returned
said
he
to
them
you
know
him
now
he
is
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
race
which
crushes
us
wo
to
him
and
when
shall
we
strike
when
five
sounds
and
the
tocsin
from
the
mountain
gives
the
signal
of
vengeance
then
the
sambo
marched
with
hasty
steps
to
the
and
rejoined
the
chief
of
the
revolt
meanwhile
the
sun
had
begun
to
sink
beneath
the
horizon
it
was
the
hour
in
which
the
limanian
aristocracy
went
in
its
turn
to
the
amancaës
the
richest
toilets
shone
in
the
equipages
which
defiled
to
the
right
and
left
beneath
the
trees
along
the
road
there
was
an
inextricable
mêlée
of
carriages
horses
a
confusion
of
cries
songs
instruments
and
vociferations
the
clock
on
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
suddenly
struck
five
and
a
shrill
funereal
sound
vibrated
through
the
air
the
tocsin
thundered
over
the
crowd
frozen
in
its
delirium
an
immense
cry
resounded
in
the
city
from
every
square
every
street
every
house
issued
the
indians
with
arms
in
their
hands
and
fury
in
their
eyes
the
principal
places
of
the
city
were
thronged
with
these
men
some
of
whom
shook
above
their
heads
burning
torches
death
to
the
spaniards
death
to
the
oppressors
such
was
the
of
the
rebels
those
who
attempted
to
return
to
lima
must
have
recoiled
before
these
masses
but
the
summits
of
the
hills
were
quickly
covered
with
other
enemies
and
all
retreat
was
impossible
the
precipitated
themselves
like
a
thunderbolt
on
this
crowd
exhausted
with
the
fatigues
of
the
festival
while
the
mountain
indians
cleared
for
themselves
a
bloody
path
to
rejoin
their
brethren
of
the
city
imagine
the
aspect
presented
by
lima
at
this
terrible
moment
the
rebels
had
left
the
square
of
the
tavern
and
were
scattered
in
all
quarters
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
columns
martin
paz
was
waving
the
black
flag
the
flag
of
independence
while
the
indians
in
the
other
streets
were
attacking
the
houses
appointed
to
ruin
martin
paz
took
possession
of
the
with
his
company
near
him
manangani
was
uttering
ferocious
yells
and
proudly
displaying
his
bloody
arms
but
the
soldiers
of
the
government
forewarned
of
the
revolt
were
ranged
in
battle
array
before
the
palace
of
the
president
a
frightful
greeted
the
insurgents
at
their
entrance
on
the
square
surprised
by
this
unexpected
discharge
which
extended
a
goodly
number
of
them
on
the
ground
they
sprang
upon
the
troops
with
insurmountable
impatience
a
horrible
mêlée
followed
in
which
men
fought
body
to
body
martin
paz
and
manangani
performed
prodigies
of
valor
and
escaped
death
only
by
miracle
it
was
necessary
at
all
hazards
that
the
palace
should
be
taken
and
occupied
by
their
men
forward
cried
martin
paz
and
his
voice
led
the
indians
to
the
assault
although
they
were
crushed
in
every
direction
they
succeeded
in
making
the
body
of
troops
around
the
palace
recoil
already
had
manangani
sprang
on
the
first
steps
but
he
suddenly
stopped
as
the
opening
ranks
of
soldiers
unmasked
two
pieces
of
cannon
ready
to
fire
on
the
assailants
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
the
battery
must
be
seized
before
it
could
be
discharged
on
cried
manangani
addressing
himself
to
martin
paz
but
the
young
indian
had
just
stooped
and
no
longer
heard
him
for
an
indian
had
whispered
these
words
in
his
ear
they
are
pillaging
the
house
of
don
vegal
perhaps
assassinating
him
at
these
words
martin
paz
recoiled
manangani
seized
him
by
the
arm
but
repulsing
him
with
a
vigorous
hand
the
indian
darted
toward
the
square
traitor
infamous
traitor
exclaimed
manangani
discharging
his
pistols
at
martin
paz
at
this
moment
the
cannons
were
fired
and
the
grape
swept
the
indians
on
the
steps
this
way
brethren
cried
martin
paz
and
a
few
fugitives
his
devoted
companions
joined
him
with
this
little
company
he
could
make
his
way
through
the
soldiers
this
flight
had
all
the
consequences
of
treason
the
indians
believed
themselves
abandoned
by
their
chief
manangani
in
vain
attempted
to
bring
them
back
to
the
combat
a
rapid
sent
among
them
a
shower
of
balls
thenceforth
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
rally
them
the
confusion
was
at
its
height
and
the
rout
complete
the
flames
which
arose
in
certain
quarters
attracted
some
fugitives
to
pillage
but
the
conquering
soldiers
pursued
them
with
the
sword
and
killed
a
great
number
without
mercy
meanwhile
martin
paz
had
gained
the
house
of
don
vegal
it
was
the
theatre
of
a
bloody
struggle
headed
by
the
sambo
himself
he
had
a
double
interest
in
being
there
while
contending
with
the
spanish
noblemen
he
wished
to
seize
sarah
as
a
pledge
of
the
fidelity
of
his
son
on
seeing
martin
paz
return
he
no
longer
doubted
his
treason
and
turned
his
brethren
against
him
the
overthrown
gate
and
walls
of
the
court
revealed
don
vegal
sword
in
hand
surrounded
by
his
faithful
servants
and
contending
with
an
invading
mass
this
man
courage
and
pride
were
sublime
he
was
the
first
to
present
himself
to
mortal
blows
and
his
formidable
arm
had
surrounded
him
with
corpses
but
what
could
be
done
against
this
crowd
of
indians
which
was
then
increasing
with
all
the
conquered
of
the
don
vegal
felt
that
his
defenders
were
becoming
exhausted
and
nothing
remained
for
him
but
death
when
martin
paz
arrived
rapid
as
the
thunderbolt
charged
the
aggressors
from
behind
forced
them
to
turn
against
him
and
amid
balls
and
maledictions
reached
don
vegal
to
whom
he
made
a
rampart
of
his
body
courage
revived
in
the
hearts
of
the
besieged
well
done
my
son
well
done
said
don
vegal
to
martin
paz
pressing
his
hand
but
the
young
indian
was
gloomy
well
done
martin
paz
exclaimed
another
voice
which
went
to
his
very
soul
he
recognized
sarah
and
his
arm
traced
a
bloody
circle
around
him
the
company
of
sambo
gave
way
in
its
turn
twenty
times
had
this
modern
brutus
directed
his
blows
against
his
son
without
being
able
to
reach
him
and
twenty
times
martin
had
turned
away
the
weapon
about
to
strike
his
father
suddenly
the
ferocious
manangani
covered
with
blood
appeared
beside
the
sambo
thou
hast
sworn
said
he
to
avenge
the
treason
of
a
wretch
on
his
kindred
on
his
friends
on
himself
well
it
is
time
the
soldiers
are
coming
the
mestizo
andré
certa
is
with
them
come
then
said
the
sambo
with
a
ferocious
laugh
come
then
for
our
vengeance
approaches
and
both
abandoned
the
house
of
don
vegal
while
their
companions
were
being
killed
there
they
went
directly
to
the
company
who
were
arriving
the
latter
aimed
at
them
but
without
being
intimidated
the
sambo
approached
the
mestizo
you
are
andré
certa
said
he
well
your
betrothed
is
in
the
house
of
don
vegal
and
martin
paz
is
about
to
carry
her
to
the
mountains
this
said
the
indians
disappeared
thus
the
sambo
had
put
face
to
face
two
mortal
enemies
and
deceived
by
the
presence
of
martin
paz
in
the
house
of
don
vegal
the
soldiers
rushed
upon
the
dwelling
of
the
marquis
andré
certa
was
intoxicated
with
rage
as
soon
as
he
perceived
martin
paz
he
rushed
upon
him
here
exclaimed
the
young
indian
and
quitting
the
stone
steps
which
he
had
so
valiantly
defended
he
joined
the
mestizo
meanwhile
the
companions
of
martin
paz
were
repulsing
the
soldiers
body
to
body
martin
paz
had
seized
andré
certa
with
his
powerful
hand
and
clasped
him
so
closely
that
the
mestizo
could
not
use
his
pistols
they
were
there
foot
against
foot
breast
against
breast
their
faces
touched
and
their
glances
mingled
in
a
single
gleam
their
movements
became
rapid
even
invisible
neither
friends
nor
enemies
could
approach
them
in
this
terrible
embrace
respiration
failed
both
fell
andré
certa
raised
himself
above
martin
paz
whose
poignard
had
escaped
his
grasp
the
mestizo
raised
his
arm
but
the
indian
succeeded
in
seizing
it
before
it
had
struck
the
moment
was
horrible
andré
certa
in
vain
attempted
to
disengage
himself
martin
paz
with
supernatural
strength
turned
against
the
mestizo
the
poignard
and
the
arm
which
held
it
and
plunged
it
into
his
heart
martin
paz
arose
all
bloody

in

formidable
in
the
hands
of
don
vegal
was
suspended
at
his
side
martin
paz
had
encircled
himself
with
his
lasso
one
extremity
of
which
was
fixed
to
the
harness
of
his
mule
the
spaniard
and
the
indian
spurred
their
horses
to
their
utmost
speed
at
the
moment
of
leaving
the
walls
of
the
city
they
were
joined
by
an
indian
equipped
like
themselves
it
was
liberta
don
vegal
recognized
him
the
faithful
servant
wished
to
share
in
their
pursuit
martin
paz
knew
all
the
plains
all
the
mountains
which
they
were
to
traverse
he
knew
among
what
savage
tribes
into
what
desert
country
the
sambo
had
conveyed
his
betrothed
his
betrothed
he
no
longer
dared
give
this
name
to
the
daughter
of
don
vegal
my
son
said
the
latter
have
you
any
hope
in
your
heart
as
much
as
hatred
and
tenderness
the
daughter
of
the
jew
in
becoming
my
blood
has
not
ceased
to
be
thine
let
us
press
on
hastily
replied
martin
paz
on
their
way
the
travelers
saw
a
great
number
of
indians
flying
to
regain
their
amid
the
mountains
the
defection
of
martin
paz
had
been
followed
by
defeat
if
the
had
triumphed
in
some
places
it
had
received
its
at
lima
the
three
cavaliers
traveled
rapidly
having
but
one
idea
one
object
they
soon
buried
themselves
among
the
almost
impracticable
passes
of
the
cordilleras
difficult
pathways
circulated
through
these
reddish
masses
planted
here
and
there
with
cocoanut
and
pine
trees
the
cedars
and
aloes
were
left
behind
them
with
the
plains
covered
with
maize
and
lucerne
some
thorny
cactuses
sometimes
pricked
their
mules
and
made
them
hesitate
on
the
verge
of
precipices
it
was
a
difficult
task
to
traverse
the
cordilleras
during
these
summer
months
the
melting
of
snows
beneath
the
sun
of
june
often
made
unforeseen
cataracts
spout
from
beneath
the
steps
of
the
traveler
often
frightful
masses
detaching
themselves
from
the
summits
of
the
peaks
were
engulfed
near
them
in
fathomless
abysses
but
they
continued
their
march
fearing
neither
the
hurricane
nor
the
cold
of
these
high
solitudes
they
traveled
day
and
night
finding
neither
cities
nor
dwellings
where
they
might
for
a
moment
repose
happy
if
in
some
deserted
hut
they
found
a
mat
of
upon
which
to
extend
their
wearied
limbs
some
pieces
of
meat
dried
in
the
sun
some
calabashes
full
of
muddy
water
they
reached
at
last
the
summit
of
the
andes
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
there
no
more
trees
no
more
vegetation
sometimes
an
or
a
sort
of
enormous
black
bear
came
to
meet
them
often
during
the
afternoon
they
were
enveloped
in
those
formidable
storms
of
the
cordilleras
which
raise
whirlwinds
of
snow
from
the
loftiest
summits
don
vegal
sometimes
paused
unaccustomed
to
these
frightful
perils
martin
paz
then
supported
him
in
his
arms
and
sheltered
him
against
the
drifting
snow
and
yet
lightnings
flashed
from
the
clouds
and
thunders
broke
over
these
barren
peaks
and
filled
the
mountain
recesses
with
their
terrific
roar
at
this
point
the
most
elevated
of
the
andes
the
travelers
were
seized
with
a
malady
called
by
the
indians
which
deprives
the
most
intrepid
man
of
his
courage
and
his
strength
a
superhuman
will
is
then
necessary
to
keep
one
from
falling
motionless
on
the
stones
of
the
road
and
being
devoured
by
those
immense
condors
which
display
above
their
vast
wings
these
three
men
spoke
little
each
wrapped
himself
in
the
silence
which
these
vast
deserts
inspired
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
cordilleras
they
hoped
to
find
traces
of
their
enemies
they
therefore
traveled
on
and
were
at
last
descending
the
chain
of
mountains
but
the
andes
are
composed
of
a
great
number
of
salient
peaks
so
that
inaccessible
precipices
were
constantly
rising
before
them
nevertheless
they
soon
found
the
trees
of
inferior
levels
the
llamas
the
vigonias
which
feed
on
the
thin
grass
announced
the
neighborhood
of
men
sometimes
they
met
conducting
their
of
mules
and
more
than
one
leader
of
a
convoy
exchanged
fresh
animals
for
their
exhausted
ones
in
this
manner
they
reached
the
immense
virgin
forests
which
cover
the
plains
situated
between
peru
and
brazil
they
began
thenceforth
to
recover
traces
of
the
captors
and
it
was
in
the
midst
of
these
inextricable
woods
that
martin
paz
recovered
all
his
indian
sagacity
courage
returned
to
the
spaniard
strength
returned
to
liberta
when
a
fire
and
prints
of
footsteps
proved
the
proximity
of
their
enemies
martin
paz
noted
all
and
studied
all
the
breaking
of
the
little
branches
the
nature
of
the
vestiges
don
vegal
feared
lest
his
unfortunate
daughter
should
have
been
dragged
on
foot
through
the
stones
and
thorns
but
the
indian
showed
him
some
pebbles
strongly
imbedded
in
the
earth
which
indicated
the
pressure
of
an
animal
foot
above
branches
had
been
pushed
aside
in
the
same
direction
which
could
have
been
reached
only
by
a
person
on
horseback
the
poor
father
comforted
himself
and
recovered
life
and
hope
and
then
martin
paz
was
so
confident
so
skillful
so
strong
that
there
were
for
him
neither
impassable
obstacles
nor
insurmountable
perils
nevertheless
immense
forests
contracted
the
horizon
around
them
and
trees
multiplied
incessantly
before
their
fatigued
eyes
one
evening
while
the
darkness
was
gathering
beneath
the
opaque
foliage
martin
paz
liberta
and
don
vegal
were
compelled
by
fatigue
to
stop
they
had
reached
the
banks
of
a
river
it
was
the
river
madeira
which
the
indian
recognized
perfectly
immense
mangrove
trees
bent
above
the
sleeping
wave
and
were
united
to
the
trees
on
the
opposite
shore
by
capricious
vines
on
which
were
balancing
the
and
the
had
the
captors
ascended
the
banks
had
they
descended
the
course
of
the
river
had
they
crossed
it
in
a
direct
line
such
were
the
questions
with
which
martin
paz
puzzled
himself
he
stepped
a
little
aside
from
his
companions
following
with
infinite
difficulty
some
fugitive
tracks
these
brought
him
to
a
clearing
a
little
less
gloomy
some
footsteps
indicated
that
a
company
of
men
had
perhaps
crossed
the
river
at
this
spot
which
was
the
opinion
of
the
indian
although
he
found
around
him
no
proof
of
the
construction
of
a
canoe
he
knew
that
the
sambo
might
have
cut
down
some
tree
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
and
having
spoiled
it
of
its
bark
made
of
it
a
boat
which
could
have
been
carried
on
the
arms
of
men
to
the
shores
of
the
madeira
nevertheless
he
was
still
hesitating
when
he
saw
a
sort
of
black
mass
move
near
a
thicket
he
quickly
prepared
his
lasso
and
made
ready
for
an
attack
he
advanced
a
few
paces
and
perceived
an
animal
lying
on
the
ground
a
prey
to
the
final
convulsions
it
was
a
mule
the
poor
expiring
beast
had
been
struck
at
a
distance
from
the
spot
whither
it
had
been
dragged
leaving
long
traces
of
blood
on
its
passage
martin
paz
no
longer
doubted
that
the
indians
unable
to
induce
it
to
cross
the
river
had
killed
it
with
the
stroke
of
a
poignard
as
a
deep
wound
indicated
from
this
moment
he
felt
certain
of
the
direction
of
his
enemies
and
returned
to
his
companions
who
were
already
uneasy
at
his
long
absence
perhaps
we
shall
see
the
young
girl
said
he
to
them
my
daughter
oh
my
son
let
us
set
out
this
instant
said
the
spaniard
i
am
no
longer
fatigued
and
strength
returns
with
hope
let
us
go
but
we
must
cross
this
river
and
we
can
not
lose
time
in
constructing
a
canoe
we
will
swim
across
courage
then
my
father
liberta
and
myself
will
sustain
you
all
three
laid
aside
their
garments
which
martin
paz
carried
in
a
bundle
upon
his
head
and
all
three
glided
silently
into
the
water
for
fear
of
awakening
some
of
these
dangerous
so
numerous
in
the
rivers
of
brazil
and
peru
they
arrived
safely
at
the
opposite
shore
the
first
care
of
martin
paz
was
to
recover
traces
of
the
indians
but
in
vain
did
he
scrutinize
the
smallest
leaves
the
smallest
pebbles
he
could
discover
nothing
as
the
rapid
current
had
carried
them
down
in
crossing
he
ascended
the
bank
of
the
river
to
the
spot
opposite
that
where
he
had
found
the
mule
but
nothing
indicated
the
direction
taken
by
the
captors
it
must
have
been
that
these
that
their
tracks
might
be
entirely
lost
had
descended
the
river
for
several
miles
in
order
to
land
far
from
the
spot
of
their
embarkation
martin
paz
that
his
companions
might
not
be
discouraged
did
not
communicate
to
them
his
fears
he
said
not
even
a
word
to
don
vegal
respecting
the
mule
for
fear
of
saddening
him
still
more
with
the
thought
that
his
daughter
must
now
be
dragged
through
these
difficult
passes
when
he
returned
to
the
spaniard
he
found
him
asleep
fatigue
had
prevailed
over
grief
and
resolution
martin
paz
was
careful
not
to
awaken
him
a
little
sleep
might
do
him
much
good
but
while
he
himself
watched
resting
the
head
of
don
vegal
on
his
knees
and
piercing
with
his
quick
glances
the
surrounding
shadows
he
sent
liberta
to
seek
below
on
the
river
some
trace
which
might
guide
them
at
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
the
indian
departed
in
the
direction
indicated
gliding
like
a
serpent
between
the
high
brush
with
which
the
shores
were
bristling
and
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
was
soon
lost
in
the
distance
thenceforth
martin
paz
remained
alone
amid
these
gloomy
solitudes
the
spaniard
was
sleeping
peacefully
the
names
of
his
daughter
and
the
indian
sometimes
mingled
in
his
dreams
and
alone
disturbed
the
silence
of
these
obscure
forests
the
young
indian
was
not
mistaken
the
sambo
had
descended
the
madeira
three
miles
then
had
landed
with
the
young
girl
and
his
numerous
companions
among
whom
might
be
numbered
manangani
still
covered
with
hideous
wounds
the
company
of
sambo
had
increased
during
the
journey
the
indians
of
the
plains
and
the
mountains
had
awaited
with
impatience
the
triumph
of
the
revolt
on
learning
the
failure
of
their
brethren
they
fell
a
prey
to
a
gloomy
despair
hearing
that
they
had
been
betrayed
by
martin
paz
they
uttered
yells
of
rage
when
they
saw
that
they
had
a
victim
to
be
sacrificed
to
their
anger
they
burst
forth
in
cries
of
joy
and
followed
the
company
of
the
old
indian
they
marched
thus
to
the
approaching
sacrifice
devouring
the
young
girl
with
sanguinary
glances
it
was
the
betrothed
the
beloved
of
martin
paz
whom
they
were
about
to
put
to
death
abuse
was
heaped
upon
her
and
more
than
once
the
sambo
who
wished
his
revenge
to
be
public
with
difficulty
wrested
sarah
from
their
fury
the
young
girl
pale
languishing
was
without
thought
and
almost
without
life
amid
this
frightful
horde
she
had
no
longer
the
sentiment
of
motion
of
will
of
existence
she
advanced
because
bloody
hands
urged
her
onward
they
might
have
abandoned
her
in
the
midst
of
these
great
solitudes
she
could
not
have
taken
a
step
to
have
escaped
death
sometimes
the
remembrance
of
her
father
and
of
the
young
indian
passed
before
her
eyes
but
like
a
gleam
of
lightning
bewildering
her
then
she
fell
again
an
inert
mass
on
the
neck
of
the
poor
mule
whose
wounded
feet
could
no
longer
sustain
her
when
beyond
the
river
she
was
compelled
to
follow
her
captors
on
foot
two
indians
taking
her
by
the
arm
dragged
her
rapidly
along
and
a
trace
of
blood
marked
on
the
sand
and
dead
leaves
her
painful
passage
but
the
sambo
was
no
longer
afraid
of
pursuit
he
cared
little
that
this
blood
betrayed
the
direction
he
had
taken
he
was
approaching
the
termination
of
his
journey
and
soon
the
cataracts
which
abound
in
the
currents
of
the
great
river
sent
up
their
deafening
clamor
the
numerous
company
of
indians
arrived
at
a
sort
of
village
composed
of
a
hundred
huts
made
of
reeds
interlaced
and
clay
at
their
approach
a
multitude
of
women
and
children
darted
toward
them
with
loud
cries
of
joy
more
than
one
found
there
his
anxious
family
more
than
one
wife
missed
the
father
of
her
children
these
women
soon
learned
the
defeat
of
their
party
their
sadness
was
transformed
into
rage
on
learning
the
defection
of
martin
paz
and
on
seeing
his
betrothed
devoted
to
death
sarah
remained
immovable
before
these
enemies
and
looked
at
them
with
a
dim
eye
all
these
hideous
faces
were
making
grimaces
around
her
and
the
most
terrific
threats
were
uttered
in
her
ears
the
poor
child
might
have
thought
herself
delivered
over
to
the
torturers
of
the
infernal
regions
where
is
my
husband
said
one
it
is
thou
who
hast
caused
him
to
be
killed
and
my
brother
who
will
never
again
return
to
the
cabin
what
hast
thou
done
with
him
death
death
let
each
of
us
have
a
piece
of
her
flesh
let
each
of
us
have
a
pain
to
make
her
suffer
death
death
and
these
women
with
dishevelled
hair
brandishing
knives
waving
flaming
brands
bearing
enormous
stones
approached
the
young
girl
surrounded
her
pressed
her
crushed
her
back
cried
the
sambo
back
and
let
all
await
the
decision
of
their
chiefs
this
girl
must
disarm
the
anger
of
the
great
spirit
which
has
rested
upon
our
arms
and
she
shall
not
serve
for
private
revenge
alone
the
women
obeyed
the
words
of
the
old
indian
casting
frightful
glances
on
the
young
girl
the
latter
covered
with
blood
remained
extended
on
the
pebbly
shore
above
this
village
plunges
from
a
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
a
foaming
cataract
which
breaks
against
sharp
rocks
the
madeira
contracted
into
a
deep
bed
precipitates
this
dense
mass
of
water
with
frightful
rapidity
a
cloud
of
mist
is
eternally
suspended
above
this
torrent
whose
fall
sends
its
formidable
and
thundering
roar
afar
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
foaming
tempest
that
the
unfortunate
young
girl
was
destined
to
die
at
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
exposed
in
a
bark
canoe
above
the
cataract
she
was
to
be
precipitated
with
the
mass
of
waters
on
the
rude
rocks
against
which
the
madeira
broke
so
the
council
of
chiefs
had
decided
and
they
had
delayed
until
the
morrow
the
punishment
of
their
victim
to
give
her
a
night
of
anguish
of
torment
and
of
terror
when
the
sentence
was
made
known
cries
of
joy
welcomed
it
and
a
furious
delirium
seized
the
indians
it
was
a
night
of
orgies
a
night
of
blood
and
of
horror
brandy
increased
the
excitement
of
these
wild
natives
dances
accompanied
with
perpetual
yells
surrounded
the
young
girl
and
wound
their
fantastic
chains
about
the
stake
to
which
she
was
fastened
sometimes
the
circle
narrowed
and
enlaced
her
in
its
furious
whirls
the
indians
ran
through
the
uncultivated
fields
brandishing
blazing
and
surrounding
the
victim
with
light
and
it
was
thus
until
sunrise
and
worse
yet
when
its
first
rays
illuminated
the
scene
the
young
girl
was
detached
from
the
stake
and
a
hundred
arms
were
stretched
out
to
drag
her
to
execution
when
the
name
of
martin
paz
involuntarily
escaped
her
lips
and
cries
of
hatred
and
of
vengeance
responded
it
was
necessary
to
climb
by
steep
paths
the
immense
pile
of
rocks
which
led
to
the
upper
level
of
the
river
and
the
victim
arrived
there
all
bloody
a
canoe
of
bark
awaited
her
a
hundred
paces
above
the
fall
she
was
deposited
in
it
and
fastened
by
bonds
which
entered
her
flesh
vengeance
and
death
exclaimed
the
whole
tribe
with
one
voice
the
canoe
was
hurried
on
with
increasing
rapidity
and
began
to
whirl
suddenly
a
man
appeared
on
the
opposite
shore
it
is
martin
paz
beside
him
are
don
vegal
and
liberta
my
daughter
my
daughter
exclaims
the
father
kneeling
on
the
shore
my
father
replied
sarah
raising
herself
up
with
superhuman
strength
the
scene
was
indescribable
the
canoe
was
rapidly
hastening
to
the
cataract
in
whose
foam
it
was
already
enveloped
martin
paz
standing
on
a

can
not
prevail
over
