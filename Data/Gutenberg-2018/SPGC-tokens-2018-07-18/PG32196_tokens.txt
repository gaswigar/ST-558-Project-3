crécy
introduction
between
those
last
precise
accounts
of
military
engagements
which
antiquity
has
left
us
in
small
number
and
what
may
be
called
the
modern
history
of
war
there
lies
a
period
of
many
centuries
quite
years
during
which
the
details
of
an
action
and
even
the
main
features
of
a
campaign
are
never
given
us
by
contemporary
recorders
through
all
that
vast
stretch
of
time
we
are
compelled
if
we
desire
to
describe
with
any
accuracy
and
at
any
length
the
conduct
of
a
battle
to
reconstitute
the
same
in
other
words
we
have
to
argue
from
known
conditions
to
unknown
we
have
to
establish
by
a
comparison
of
texts
and
of
traditions
and
by
other
processes
which
will
be
dealt
with
in
a
moment
a
number
of
elements
which
where
a
modern
action
is
concerned
numerous
memoirs
and
official
record
often
accompanied
by
elaborate
maps
can
put
clearly
before
us
we
should
note
that
the
line
of
division
between
what
we
will
call
a
medieval
battle
and
a
modern
one
though
it
can
not
of
course
be
precisely
established
corresponds
roughly
to
the
sixteenth
century
the
battles
of
the
seventeenth
are
for
the
most
part
open
in
detail
to
the
historian
from
copious
evidence
afforded
by
contemporary
writers
and
by
our
considerable
knowledge
of
the
tactics
and
armament
of
the
time
and
this
of
course
is
still
truer
of
the
eighteenth
and
of
the
nineteenth
centuries
subsequent
to
the
wide
employment
of
printing
and
throughout
the
sixteenth
century
the
tendency
shown
by
contemporaries
to
set
down
detail
steadily
increases
but
the
whole
of
that
century
is
transitional
in
this
matter
the
battles
of
the
fifteenth
of
the
fourteenth
and
earlier
centuries
differ
entirely
as
to
their
evidence
we
must
gather
it
from
manuscript
authorities
often
rare
sometimes
unique
those
authorities
are
again
not
always
contemporary
they
never
by
any
chance
give
us
a
map
and
rarely
a
definite
topographical
indication
they
are
summary
their
motive
is
ecclesiastical
or
civil
rather
than
military
they
present
at
the
best
the
picturesque
side
of
an
engagement
and
at
the
worst
they
preserve
a
bare
mention
of
its
date
or
the
mere
fact
that
it
took
place
even
in
the
elementary
point
of
numbers
without
some
knowledge
of
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
judge
the
nature
of
a
field
we
are
commonly
at
a
loss
where
a
smaller
force
upon
the
defensive
has
discomfited
a
larger
attacking
force
the
dramatic
character
of
such
a
success
and
crécy
was
one
of
them
has
naturally
led
to
an
exaggeration
of
the
disproportion
the
estimate
of
loss
is
very
commonly
magnified
and
untrustworthy
for
that
is
an
element
which
in
the
absence
of
exact
record
both
victors
and
vanquished
inevitably
tend
to
enlarge
we
are
not
as
a
rule
given
the
hours
sometimes
but
not
often
the
state
of
the
weather
and
especially
in
the
earlier
cases
the
local
or
tactical
result
is
of
so
much
greater
importance
to
the
chronicler
than
the
strategical
plan
that
we
are
left
with
little
more
knowledge
at
first
hand
than
the
fact
that
a
won
and
b
lost
so
true
is
this
that
with
regard
to
the
majority
of
the
great
actions
of
the
dark
ages
no
contemporary
record
even
enables
us
to
fix
their
site
within
a
few
miles
that
is
true
for
instance
of
the
decisive
defeat
of
attila
in
of
the
mahommedans
by
charles
martel
in
and
of
the
final
victory
of
alfred
over
the
danes
in
scholarship
has
established
with
infinite
pains
and
within
small
limits
of
doubt
the
second
and
the
third
the
first
is
still
disputed
so
it
is
with
the
victory
of
clovis
over
the
visigoths
and
with
any
number
of
minor
actions
even
when
we
come
to
the
later
centuries
and
to
a
more
complete
knowledge
we
are
pursued
by
this
difficulty
though
it
is
reduced
thus
we
know
the
square
mile
within
which
the
battle
of
hastings
was
fought
but
the
best
authorities
have
disputed
its
most
important
movements
and
characters
similarly
we
can
judge
the
general
terrain
of
most
of
the
crusading
fights
but
with
no
precision
and
only
at
great
pains
of
comparison
and
collation
the
battle
which
forms
the
object
of
this
little
monograph
late
as
was
its
date
was
long
the
subject
of
debate
during
the
nineteenth
century
upon
the
elementary
point
of
the
english
position
and
its
aspect
and
though
that
and
other
matters
may
now
be
regarded
as
established
we
owe
our
measure
of
certitude
upon
them
not
to
any
care
upon
the
part
of
our
earliest
informers
but
to
lengthy
and
close
argument
conducted
in
our
time
there
is
no
space
in
such
a
short
book
as
this
to
discuss
all
the
causes
which
combined
to
produce
this
negligence
of
military
detail
in
the
medieval
historian
that
he
was
usually
not
a
soldier
that
after
the
ninth
century
armies
can
not
be
regarded
as
professional
and
that
the
interest
of
the
time
lay
for
the
mass
of
readers
in
the
results
rather
than
in
the
action
of
a
battle
are
but
a
few
of
these
but
though
we
have
no
space
for
any
full
discussion
it
is
worth
the
reader
while
to
be
informed
of
the
general
process
by
which
scholarship
attempts
to
reconstitute
an
engagement
upon
which
it
has
such
insufficient
testimony
and
as
the
battle
of
crécy
is
the
first
in
this
series
which
challenges
this
sort
of
research
i
will
beg
leave
to
sketch
briefly
the
process
by
which
it
proceeds
the
first
thing
to
be
done
then
in
attempting
to
discover
what
exactly
happened
during
such
a
battle
as
that
of
crécy
is
to
tabulate
our
sources
these
are
of
three
kinds
tradition
monuments
and
documents
of
these
three
tradition
is
by
far
the
most
valuable
in
most
research
upon
affairs
of
the
dark
or
middle
ages
and
it
is
nothing
but
a
silly
intellectual
prejudice
the
fruit
of
a
narrow
religious
scepticism
now
fast
upon
the
wane
which
has
offered
to
neglect
it
unfortunately
however
tradition
is
a
particularly
weak
guide
in
this
one
department
of
knowledge
in
estimating
the
character
of
a
great
man
it
is
invaluable
it
plays
a
great
part
in
deciding
us
upon
the
nature
of
social
movements
in
helping
us
to
locate
the
sites
of
buildings
that
have
disappeared
and
particularly
of
shrines
it
gives
us
ample
testimony
too
often
neglected
to
the
authenticity
of
sacred
documents
and
to
the
origin
of
laws
it
is
even
of
some
assistance
in
establishing
certain
main
points
upon
a
military
action
if
documents
are
in
default
for
instance
a
firm
tradition
of
the
site
of
a
battle
is
evidence
not
only
in
the
absence
of
documents
but
in
negation
of
doubtful
or
vague
ones
and
so
is
a
firm
tradition
concerning
the
respective
strength
of
the
parties
if
that
tradition
can
be
stated
in
general
terms
but
for
the
particular
interest
of
military
history
it
is
worthless
because
it
is
silent
even
the
civilian
and
for
that
matter
the
soldier
as
well
who
is
not
accustomed
to
this
science
would
find
it
tedious
to
note
and
often
impossible
to
recognise
those
points
which
form
the
salient
matters
for
military
history
there
can
be
no
tradition
of
the
exact
moments
in
which
such
and
such
a
development
in
a
battle
occurred
of
contours
of
range
save
where
here
and
there
some
very
striking
event
as
in
the
case
of
the
projectile
launched
into
the
midst
of
acre
during
the
third
crusade
startles
the
mind
of
the
onlooker
and
remains
unforgotten
in
the
particular
case
of
crécy
tradition
fixes
for
us
only
two
points
though
these
have
proved
of
considerable
importance
in
modern
discussion
the
point
where
the
king
of
bohemia
fell
and
the
point
from
which
edward
iii
watched
the
battle
of
monuments
again
we
have
a
very
insufficient
supply
and
in
the
case
of
crécy
hardly
any
unless
the
point
already
alluded
to
where
the
blind
king
was
struck
down
and
the
cross
marking
it
be
counted
as
also
the
foundations
of
the
mill
which
was
the
of
the
english
commander
it
is
to
documents
then
that
we
must
look
and
unfortunately
for
this
action
our
principal
document
is
not
contemporary
it
is
from
the
pen
of
froissart
who
was
but
nine
years
old
when
the
battle
was
fought
and
who
wrote
many
years
after
its
occurrence
even
so
his
earlier
version
does
not
seem
to
be
familiar
to
the
public
of
this
country
though
it
is
certainly
the
more
accurate
froissart
used
a
contemporary
document
proceeding
from
the
pen
of
one
john
the
fair
a
canon
of
liége
of
the
lesser
authorities
some
are
contemporary
notably
baker
of
swynford
and
villani
who
died
shortly
after
the
battle
but
the
whole
bulk
of
material
at
our
disposal
is
pitifully
small
and
the
greater
part
of
what
the
reader
will
have
set
before
him
in
what
follows
is
the
result
of
an
expansion
and
criticism
of
the
few
details
which
writers
of
the
period
have
bequeathed
to
us
when
the
documentary
evidence
contemporary
or
as
nearly
contemporary
as
possible
has
been
tabulated
the
historian
of
a
medieval
battle
next
proceeds
to
consider
what
may
be
called
the
limiting
circumstances
within
which
the
action
developed
and
these
have
much
more
than
a
negative
value
as
he
proceeds
to
examine
and
to
compare
them
they
illuminate
many
a
doubtful
point
and
expand
many
an
obscure
allusion
for
instance
in
the
case
of
crécy
we
carefully
consider
the
contours
upon
the
modern
map
of
a
terrain
which
no
considerable
building
operations
or
mining
has
disfigured
we
mark
the
ascertainable
point
at
which
the
somme
was
crossed
and
calculate
the
minimum
time
in
which
a
host
of
the
least
size
to
which
we
can
limit
edward
force
could
have
marched
from
that
to
the
various
points
mentioned
in
the
approach
to
the
we
ascertain
the
distance
from
the
scene
of
action
to
the
forest
boundary
we
argue
from
the
original
royal
possession
and
subsequent
conservation
of
that
forest
its
permanent
limits
we
can
even
establish
with
some
accuracy
the
direction
of
the
wind
knowing
how
the
armies
marched
how
the
sun
stood
relative
to
the
advancing
force
and
their
impression
of
the
storm
that
broke
upon
them
we
calculate
within
certain
limits
of
error
the
distance
necessary
for
deployment
we
argue
from
the
known
character
of
the
armour
and
weapons
employed
certain
details
of
the
attack
and
defence
we
mark
what
were
certainly
the
ancient
roads
and
we
measure
the
permanent
obstacles
afforded
by
the
physical
nature
of
the
field
i
give
these
few
points
as
examples
only
they
are
multiplied
indefinitely
as
one
study
proceeds
and
in
the
result
a
fairly
accurate
description
of
so
famous
though
so
ill
attested
an
action
as
this
of
crécy
can
be
reconstituted
with
all
this
there
remains
a
large
margin
which
can
not
be
generally
set
down
as
certain
and
which
even
in
matters
essential
must
be
written
tentatively
with
such
phrases
as
it
would
seem
or
probably
to
excuse
it
but
history
is
consoled
by
the
reflection
that
all
these
gaps
may
be
filled
by
further
research
or
further
discovery
and
that
each
new
effort
of
scholarship
bridges
one
and
then
another
as
to
the
critical
power
by
which
each
individual
writer
will
decide
between
conflicting
statements
or
apparently
irreconcilable
conditions
this
must
be
left
to
his
own
power
of
discrimination
and
to
the
estimate
of
his
ability
to
weigh
evidence
he
is
in
duty
bound
as
i
have
attempted
to
do
very
briefly
in
certain
notes
to
give
the
grounds
of
his
decision
and
having
done
so
he
admits
his
reader
to
be
a
judge
over
himself
with
this
warning
however
that
historical
judgment
is
based
upon
a
vast
accumulation
of
detail
acquired
in
many
fields
besides
those
particularly
under
consideration
and
that
a
competent
historian
generally
claims
an
authority
in
his
decisions
superior
to
that
reposing
upon
no
more
than
a
mere
view
of
limited
contemporary
materials
i
the
political
circumstances
the
battle
of
crécy
was
the
first
important
decisive
action
of
what
is
called
the
hundred
years
war
this
war
figures
in
many
history
books
as
a
continued
struggle
between
two
organised
nations
england
and
france
to
present
it
in
its
true
historical
character
it
must
be
stated
in
far
different
terms
the
hundred
years
war
consisted
in
two
groups
of
fighting
widely
distant
in
time
and
only
connected
by
the
fact
that
from
first
to
last
a
plantagenet
king
of
england
claimed
the
crown
of
france
against
a
valois
cousin
of
these
two
groups
of
fighting
the
first
was
conducted
by
edward
and
covers
about
twenty
years
of
his
reign
it
was
magnificently
successful
in
the
field
and
gave
to
the
english
story
the
names
of
and
of
so
far
as
the
main
ostensible
purpose
of
that
first
fighting
was
concerned
it
was
unsuccessful
for
it
did
not
result
in
placing
edward
iii
upon
the
french
throne
the
second
group
of
actions
came
fifty
years
later
and
is
remembered
by
the
great
name
of
this
latter
part
of
the
hundred
years
war
was
conducted
by
henry
the
of
edward
iii
and
the
son
of
the
lancastrian
usurper
and
henry
was
successful
not
only
in
the
tactical
results
of
his
battles
but
in
obtaining
the
crown
of
france
for
his
house
after
his
death
his
success
crumbled
away
and
a
generation
or
so
after
agincourt
rather
more
than
one
hundred
years
after
the
beginning
of
this
long
series
of
fights
the
power
of
the
kings
of
england
upon
the
continent
had
disappeared
as
a
visible
result
of
all
their
efforts
nothing
remained
but
the
important
bastion
of
calais
the
capture
of
which
was
among
the
earliest
results
of
their
invasions
when
we
say
that
the
ostensible
object
of
all
this
conflict
from
first
to
last
was
the
establishment
of
the
plantagenet
kings
of
england
as
kings
of
france
in
the
place
of
their
cousins
the
valois
we
must
remember
what
was
meant
by
those
terms
in
the
fourteenth
century
when
edward
first
engaged
in
the
duel
there
was
no
conception
of
the
conquest
of
a
power
such
as
would
lie
in
the
mind
of
a
statesman
of
society
was
still
feudal
allegiance
lay
from
a
man
to
his
lord
not
from
a
man
to
his
central
political
government
not
only
the
religion
the
thoughts
and
the
daily
conduct
of
either
party
to
the
war
were
the
same
but
in
the
governing
society
of
both
camps
the
language
and
the
very
blood
were
the
same
edward
was
a
plantagenet
that
is
his
family
tradition
was
that
of
one
of
the
great
french
feudal
nobles
it
was
little
more
than
one
hundred
years
before
that
his
had
been
the
actual
and
ruling
lord
of
normandy
and
of
france
to
the
west
and
the
for
the
first
plantagenet
had
though
holding
of
the
crown
at
paris
been
the
active
monarch
of
aquitaine
of
brittany
of
anjou
normandy
and
maine
so
much
for
the
general
sentiment
under
which
the
war
was
engaged
as
to
its
particular
excuse
this
was
slight
and
hardly
tenable
and
we
may
doubt
whether
edward
intended
to
press
it
seriously
he
engaged
in
the
war
from
that
spirit
of
chivalric
adventure
a
little
unreal
but
informed
by
an
indubitable
taste
for
arms
which
was
the
mark
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
decline
from
the
sincere
knightly
spirit
of
the
thirteenth
the
excuse
given
was
this
the
french
monarchy
had
descended
from
its
foundation
in
right
down
to
the
death
of
charles
iv
in
directly
from
father
to
son
but
in
that
year
male
issue
failed
the
direct
line
the
obviously
rightful
claimant
to
the
throne
according
to
the
ideas
of
those
times
and
particularly
of
northern
france
was
philip
of
valois
the
first
cousin
of
the
king
charles
who
had
just
died
charles
iv
had
been
the
son
of
king
philip
and
philip
of
valois
was
the
son
of
charles
of
valois
philip
iv
brother
philip
of
valois
was
therefore
the
eldest
in
unbroken
male
descent
of
the
house
it
might
be
claimed
and
it
was
claimed
by
edward
iii
that
the
daughters
of
elder
brothers
and
their
issue
should
count
before
the
sons
of
younger
brothers
now
there
were
two
female
heiresses
or
their
issue
present
as
against
philip
of
valois
charles
the
king
just
dead
had
a
sister
isabella
and
isabella
was
the
mother
of
edward
iii
of
england
but
an
elder
brother
to
charles
namely
louis
had
himself
left
a
daughter
who
was
now
the
queen
of
navarre
if
this
principle
that
the
daughter
or
the
issue
of
the
daughter
of
an
elder
brother
should
count
before
the
male
issue
of
a
younger
brother
had
been
granted
in
its
entirety
edward
would
have
had
no
claim
because
this
elder
brother
of
charles
louis
had
had
issue
that
daughter
joan
the
wife
of
the
king
of
navarre
so
edward
qualified
this
first
general
principle
that
one
could
inherit
through
women
by
another
principle
to
wit
that
though
the
to
the
throne
should
proceed
through
the
of
brothers
rather
than
through
the
of
ones
yet
the
could
only
actually
be
held
by
a
male
by
this
tortuous
combination
edward
iii
advanced
his
claim
his
mother
had
been
the
of
philip
iii
of
france
and
he
was
a
male
her
father
was
the
elder
brother
of
philip
of
valois
father
so
he
claimed
before
philip
of
valois
the
whole
scheme
is
apparent
from
the
following
table
philip
iii
philip
iv
charles
of
valois
louis
philip
charles
iv
ii
philip
vi
edward
iii
of
navarre
john
edward
the
black
prince
but
i
repeat
we
must
not
take
edward
political
claim
too
seriously
his
real
object
was
not
so
much
to
establish
himself
upon
the
throne
of
france
and
to
create
a
great
united
monarchy
of
french
and
british
under
the
single
rule
of
the
plantagenets
as
to
try
a
great
adventure
and
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
it
was
this
that
gave
to
edward
wars
the
character
not
of
campaigns
with
a
fixed
object
but
great
raids
the
very
successes
of
which
were
unexpected
and
only
half
fruitful
it
was
this
again
which
made
him
so
uncertain
and
vacillating
as
to
how
he
should
use
those
successes
when
they
came
which
made
him
suggest
now
this
now
that
basis
for
peace
after
each
victory
but
never
to
insist
very
particularly
however
surprising
and
thorough
his
work
in
the
field
upon
the
french
throne
it
was
this
again
which
gave
to
the
actual
results
of
his
battles
haphazard
consequences
as
it
were
the
most
notable
and
permanent
of
which
was
the
english
hold
upon
calais
and
it
was
this
which
always
left
so
huge
a
disproportion
between
the
object
he
in
theory
desired
to
obtain
and
the
forces
with
which
he
set
out
to
attain
it
to
sum
up
we
shall
only
understand
the
victory
of
crécy
and
the
succeeding
twin
victory
of
poitiers
ten
years
later
if
we
conceive
of
the
whole
business
as
something
of
a
tournament
rather
than
a
true
political
or
even
dynastic
struggle
further
we
must
always
remember
that
the
leaders
upon
both
sides
came
of
one
society
were
of
one
speech
and
of
one
manner
often
closely
related
in
blood
we
must
remember
that
it
was
no
desertion
for
a
french
lord
to
serve
the
king
of
england
and
that
even
brothers
would
be
found
as
were
the
two
harcourts
honourably
attached
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
time
to
opposing
forces
beneath
this
social
aspect
of
the
wars
there
was
of
course
the
growing
national
sentiment
of
the
french
and
of
the
english
most
of
the
men
who
fought
against
edward
at
crécy
especially
of
the
obscure
men
thought
of
paris
as
the
only
possible
seat
of
authority
and
of
the
valois
as
their
only
possible
king
all
the
archers
at
crécy
and
many
of
the
squires
there
and
a
good
half
even
of
the
forces
at
poitiers
were
and
had
no
experience
of
life
save
that
confined
to
this
island
up
to
the
moment
when
they
set
out
for
the
great
raids
upon
the
continent
as
the
hundred
years
war
proceeded
as
it
approached
its
second
phase
in
which
henry
was
actually
successful
in
obtaining
the
crown
of
france
or
rather
the
reversion
of
it
the
national
feeling
was
growing
rapidly
upon
either
side
and
by
the
time
of
joan
of
arc
campaign
and
of
the
subsequent
loss
of
normandy
by
the
plantagenets
everyone
outside
the
small
governing
class
of
either
country
had
come
to
think
of
the
business
as
a
national
one
upon
either
side
but
with
crécy
it
was
not
so
and
we
must
approach
the
military
problems
of
crécy
with
the
political
provision
in
mind
that
the
whole
affair
of
that
battle
and
of
its
immediate
successors
was
a
feudal
occupation
one
had
almost
said
pastime
engaged
within
the
circle
of
that
widespread
nobility
common
to
and
intermarried
between
gaul
and
britain
which
for
three
hundred
years
ruled
society
from
the
grampians
to
the
mediterranean
illustration
ii
the
campaign
of
crécy
the
campaign
of
crécy
took
place
within
a
district
of
france
contained
by
an
east
and
west
base
miles
in
length
and
an
eastern
border
north
and
south
miles
in
length
and
sketched
in
the
map
opposite
the
rectangular
parallelogram
so
formed
is
nearly
equally
divided
between
land
and
sea
the
half
being
a
portion
of
northern
france
and
the
half
the
english
channel
the
land
half
is
thus
roughly
triangular
having
paris
at
its
extreme
corner
calais
at
its
extreme
the
neighbourhood
of
avranches
with
st
malo
bay
at
its
corner
it
includes
part
of
the
provinces
of
normandy
the
ile
de
france
picardy
and
artois
and
part
or
all
of
the
modern
departments
of
the
manche
orne
calvados
eure
seine
oise
somme
and
it
will
be
seen
that
this
territory
is
nearly
evenly
divided
by
the
river
seine
and
the
campaign
of
crécy
is
also
divided
by
that
river
in
the
sense
that
the
english
advance
took
place
wholly
to
the
west
of
it
and
the
english
retreat
wholly
to
the
east
of
it
the
campaign
as
a
whole
resolves
itself
up
to
and
including
the
battle
of
crécy
which
is
the
subject
of
this
book
and
excluding
the
continuation
of
the
march
after
crécy
and
the
capture
of
calais
into
an
advance
from
the
channel
coast
to
paris
and
a
retreat
from
paris
to
the
channel
again
the
two
portions
being
divided
by
the
crossing
of
the
seine
at
poissy
the
advance
leaves
the
coast
at
the
summit
of
that
projection
of
normandy
called
the
cotentin
and
proceeds
a
little
south
of
east
towards
paris
the
walls
of
which
are
reached
by
its
outermost
skirmishers
while
the
main
army
crosses
the
seine
at
poissy
the
retreat
is
effected
from
poissy
northward
to
the
victorious
field
of
crécy
and
later
from
crécy
on
the
same
line
to
the
siege
and
capture
of
calais
the
time
occupied
from
the
day
of
landing
to
the
day
of
the
battle
of
crécy
inclusive
is
but
days
of
which
not
quite
are
taken
up
by
advance
and
rather
more
than
a
third
by
the
retreat
the
english
troops
landed
on
wednesday
july
they
crossed
the
seine
at
poissy
upon
august
they
fought
at
crécy
upon
saturday
august
the
total
distance
traversed
by
the
main
body
in
these
two
limbs
of
the
campaign
is
instructive
as
showing
the
leisure
of
the
first
part
its
advance
and
the
precipitancy
of
the
second
part
its
retreat
the
distance
by
road
as
the
army
marched
from
st
vaast
where
it
landed
across
the
river
at
poissy
and
so
to
crécy
was
a
total
of
miles
of
this
the
first
part
or
advance
was
the
second
part
or
retreat
the
first
part
occupied
counting
the
day
of
landing
and
the
day
of
crossing
at
poissy
not
less
than
days
while
the
latter
portion
or
retreat
of
miles
including
the
day
of
battle
itself
took
up
not
more
than
days
or
excluding
the
battle
only
the
average
rate
of
the
advance
was
not
more
than
miles
a
day
the
average
rate
of
the
retreat
very
nearly
double
it
must
not
be
imagined
of
course
that
the
advance
took
place
in
prompt
and
regular
fashion
it
was
as
we
shall
see
irresolute
for
many
days
and
irregular
throughout
while
the
retreat
was
a
hurried
one
upon
all
but
one
day
of
which
the
troops
were
pressed
to
their
uttermost
but
the
contrast
is
sufficient
to
show
the
difference
between
the
frames
of
mind
in
which
edward
iii
took
up
the
somewhat
hazy
plan
of
an
invasion
which
was
really
no
more
than
a
raid
and
that
in
which
he
attempted
to
extricate
himself
from
the
consequences
of
his
original
vagueness
of
intent
in
the
first
he
was
as
slow
as
he
was
uncertain
in
the
second
he
was
as
precipitate
as
he
was
determined
in
the
last
days
of
june
edward
iii
had
gathered
a
force
small
indeed
for
the
purpose
which
he
seems
to
have
had
in
mind
but
large
under
the
conditions
of
transport
which
he
could
command
it
was
probably
just
under
actual
fighting
men
at
this
point
however
as
it
is
of
material
interest
to
the
rest
of
the
story
we
must
pause
to
consider
what
these
units
meant
when
we
say
a
little
less
or
it
may
have
been
a
little
more
than
fighting
men
we
mean
that
the
that
is
fully
equipped
mounted
men
for
the
most
part
gentlemen
together
with
not
welsh
and
border
infantry
and
approximately
archers
bring
us
near
to
that
total
but
an
army
of
the
fourteenth
century
was
accompanied
by
a
number
of
servants
at
least
equal
to
its
mounted
armed
gentry
men
who
saw
to
the
equipment
and
service
of
the
knights
no
man
at
arms
was
fit
to
pass
through
a
campaign
without
at
least
one
aide
if
only
for
armouring
and
for
all
the
doubtfulness
of
the
records
we
know
that
the
yeoman
archers
were
also
served
by
men
who
carried
a
portion
of
their
equipment
and
who
saw
to
their
supply
in
action
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
computation
at
all
accurate
of
the
extra
rations
this
organisation
involved
nor
of
what
proportion
of
these
uncounted
units
could
be
used
in
the
fighting
we
are
perhaps
safe
in
saying
that
the
total
number
who
landed
were
not
double
the
fighting
men
actually
counted
and
that
edward
whole
force
certainly
was
much
more
than
but
almost
as
certainly
not
men
we
must
imagine
all
told
perhaps
horses
to
have
been
assembled
with
the
force
for
transport
over
sea
others
would
be
seized
for
transport
on
the
march
it
is
remarkable
that
edward
carefully
organised
certain
small
auxiliary
bodies
smiths
artificers
and
took
with
him
five
cannon
it
was
not
until
tuesday
the
of
july
that
the
very
large
fleet
which
the
king
had
pressed
for
the
service
was
able
to
sail
from
the
solent
and
spithead
it
crossed
in
the
night
with
a
northerly
breeze
and
appeared
upon
the
following
morning
off
st
vaast
st
vaast
lies
in
a
little
recess
of
the
coast
of
the
cotentin
protected
from
all
winds
blowing
from
the
outer
channel
and
only
open
to
such
seas
as
can
be
raised
in
the
estuary
of
the
seine
by
a
breeze
it
was
therefore
seeing
the
direction
of
the
wind
under
which
they
had
sailed
upon
a
calm
shore
that
this
considerable
expedition
disembarked
we
may
presume
under
such
circumstances
that
though
edward
had
announced
his
decision
of
sailing
for
france
the
point
of
disembarkation
had
been
carefully
settled
and
that
a
course
had
been
laid
for
it
a
small
force
composed
of
local
levies
had
been
raised
to
resist
the
landing
it
was
able
to
effect
nothing
and
was
easily
dispersed
by
a
body
of
the
invaders
under
the
earl
of
salisbury
to
whom
that
duty
had
been
assigned
for
nearly
a
week
the
army
rested
where
it
had
landed
sending
out
detachments
to
pillage
barfleur
was
sacked
cherbourg
was
attacked
and
the
countryside
was
ravaged
it
was
upon
tuesday
july
the
that
the
main
body
set
out
upon
its
march
to
the
south
and
east
no
considerable
body
could
meet
them
for
weeks
and
all
the
french
feudal
force
was
engaged
near
paris
or
to
south
of
it
and
would
take
weeks
to
concentrate
northward
edward
was
free
to
raid
the
attempt
to
construct
an
accurate
of
the
march
which
edward
iii
took
through
normandy
during
his
advance
up
the
seine
as
far
as
poissy
and
thence
northward
in
retreat
towards
picardy
and
the
sea
has
only
recently
been
attempted
froissart
that
vivid
and
picturesque
writer
who
both
from
his
volume
and
his
style
was
long
taken
as
the
sole
general
authority
for
this
war
is
hopeless
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
a
map
or
of
setting
down
accurate
military
details
he
had
but
the
vaguest
idea
of
how
the
march
of
an
army
should
be
organised
and
he
was
profoundly
indifferent
to
geography
he
added
to
or
subtracted
from
numbers
with
childlike
simplicity
and
in
the
honourable
motive
of
pleasing
his
readers
or
patrons
when
quite
in
the
last
few
years
an
attempt
at
accuracy
in
the
plotting
out
of
this
march
was
first
made
it
was
based
upon
not
froissart
but
contemporary
records
and
of
these
by
far
the
most
important
are
and
the
accounts
of
the
kitchen
which
happen
to
have
been
saved
baker
was
finally
edited
by
professor
maunde
thompson
in
the
work
is
a
standard
work
and
generally
regarded
as
the
best
example
of
its
kind
in
making
his
notes
upon
that
document
professor
maunde
thompson
compared
the
given
by
baker
and
other
authorities
with
those
of
the
accounts
of
the
kitchen
and
established
for
the
first
time
something
like
an
exact
record
but
many
apparent
discrepancies
still
remained
and
several
puzzling
anomalies
i
have
attempted
in
what
follows
to
reconstruct
the
whole
accurately
and
i
think
i
have
done
so
up
to
and
including
the
passage
of
the
somme
from
boismont
a
point
not
hitherto
established
first
i
would
point
out
that
of
all
the
few
bases
of
evidence
from
which
we
can
work
that
of
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
accounts
is
by
far
the
most
valuable
it
should
be
a
canon
in
all
historical
work
that
the
unconscious
witness
is
the
most
trustworthy
i
mean
by
unconscious
evidence
the
evidence
afforded
by
one
who
is
not
interested
in
the
type
of
action
which
one
is
attempting
to
establish
suppose
for
instance
you
wanted
to
know
on
exactly
what
day
a
prime
minister
of
england
left
london
for
paris
upon
some
important
mission
his
biographer
who
sets
out
to
write
an
interesting
political
life
and
to
insist
upon
certain
motives
in
him
will
say
it
is
the
of
june
because
lady
mentions
it
in
her
diary
and
because
he
finds
a
letter
written
by
the
prime
minister
in
paris
on
the
perhaps
it
is
more
important
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
detail
that
the
journey
should
be
a
hurried
one
and
without
knowing
it
the
biographer
is
biased
in
that
direction
there
may
be
twenty
documents
from
the
pens
of
people
concerned
with
affairs
of
state
which
would
lead
us
to
that
he
left
london
on
the
and
perhaps
only
five
that
would
lead
us
to
infer
that
he
left
on
an
earlier
day
and
weighing
the
position
and
responsibility
of
the
witnesses
the
biographer
will
decide
for
the
twenty
but
if
we
come
across
a
postcard
written
from
calais
by
the
prime
minister
valet
to
a
fellow
servant
at
home
asking
for
the
prime
minister
overcoat
to
be
sent
on
and
if
he
mentions
the
weather
which
we
find
to
correspond
to
the
date
the
and
if
further
we
have
the
postmark
of
the
on
the
postcard
then
we
can
be
absolutely
certain
that
the
majority
of
the
fuller
accounts
were
wrong
and
that
the
prime
minister
crossed
not
on
the
but
on
the
for
we
have
a
converging
set
of
independent
witnesses
none
of
whom
have
any
reason
to
make
the
journey
seem
later
than
it
was
all
concerned
with
trivial
duties
and
each
unconscious
of
the
effect
upon
history
of
their
evidence
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
the
servant
had
forged
a
date
and
if
we
suppose
him
to
have
made
a
mistake
we
are
corrected
by
the
equally
trivial
points
of
the
postmark
and
the
french
stamp
and
the
mention
of
the
weather
so
it
is
with
this
manuscript
record
of
the
king
kitchen
expenses
and
of
the
several
at
which
they
were
incurred
wherever
there
is
conflict
it
must
override
all
other
evidence
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
to
whom
we
owe
this
very
valuable
testimony
was
one
william
of
retford
his
accounts
were
kept
in
a
beautifully
neat
but
not
very
legible
hand
upon
long
sheets
of
parchment
and
are
now
luckily
preserved
for
our
inspection
at
the
record
office
with
every
day
halt
the
place
where
victuals
were
bought
for
the
king
that
is
where
the
king
household
lay
has
its
name
marked
upon
these
accounts
but
unfortunately
the
abbreviations
used
in
the
coupled
with
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
the
short
strokes
from
from
etc
upon
parchment
which
time
has
faded
and
on
the
top
of
that
the
indifference
of
the
scribe
to
the
foreign
names
themselves
do
not
render
the
task
particularly
easy
the
has
not
i
believe
ever
been
published
i
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
over
it
and
i
will
give
my
conclusions
as
best
i
can
the
main
army
stayed
at
st
vaast
as
i
have
said
for
six
days
that
is
until
tuesday
july
this
was
presumably
done
to
recruit
the
horses
and
the
men
foraging
parties
went
out
in
the
interval
but
the
bulk
of
the
force
did
not
move
on
that
tuesday
it
struck
inland
for
valognes
a
march
of
miles
no
proper
existed
even
as
late
as
the
eighteenth
century
let
alone
in
the
middle
ages
and
an
army
making
for
paris
or
for
the
crossing
of
the
seine
could
not
choose
but
to
go
thus
slightly
out
of
its
way
from
valognes
there
is
a
two
days
march
to
carentan
which
town
was
the
lowest
of
the
river
douves
we
may
naturally
expect
the
halt
between
the
two
to
have
been
about
midway
and
this
would
give
us
a
town
called
ste
mère
but
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
puts
down
st
come
du
mont
we
conclude
therefore
that
the
king
staff
did
not
follow
the
great
road
which
had
existed
from
roman
times
but
went
by
bypaths
to
the
east
of
it
where
st
come
du
mont
lies
it
was
a
long
day
march
of
over
fourteen
miles
but
the
next
day
march
that
of
thursday
the
to
carentan
was
a
short
one
of
not
more
than
eight
or
nine
allowing
in
both
cases
for
the
windings
of
the
on
friday
the
the
king
lay
at
pont
hébert
this
is
another
example
of
something
very
like
a
long
march
followed
by
a
short
one
upon
the
morrow
st
lô
was
the
of
the
saturday
and
pont
hébert
is
but
four
miles
from
st
lô
of
a
total
therefore
of
nearly
seventeen
miles
over
thirteen
are
covered
upon
one
day
and
but
four
upon
the
next
at
this
point
it
is
worth
noticing
the
character
of
all
the
advance
with
which
we
are
dealing
edward
had
been
blamed
for
sluggishness
he
was
not
so
much
sluggish
as
apparently
without
plan
he
did
not
know
quite
what
he
was
going
to
do
next
his
general
intention
seems
to
have
been
to
make
sooner
or
later
for
his
allies
in
flanders
and
meanwhile
to
take
rich
towns
and
loot
them
and
to
bring
pressure
upon
the
king
of
france
by
ravaging
distant
and
populous
territories
which
the
french
army
could
not
rapidly
reach
he
therefore
often
makes
a
good
and
steady
marching
in
this
advance
but
he
also
lingers
uselessly
at
towns
and
intercalates
very
short
marches
between
the
long
ones
thus
he
deliberately
struck
inland
to
st
lô
on
his
way
to
caen
because
st
lô
was
a
fine
fat
booty
instead
of
making
by
the
short
road
which
runs
from
carentan
through
bayeux
the
whole
character
of
the
advance
clearly
betrays
the
point
i
have
already
made
that
this
early
part
of
the
hundred
years
war
was
essentially
a
series
of
raids
at
this
stage
it
is
well
to
point
out
to
the
reader
two
difficulties
which
have
confused
historians
the
first
is
the
fact
that
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
often
takes
a
shot
at
a
french
name
which
he
has
either
heard
inaccurately
or
which
he
attempts
to
spell
phonetically
so
that
we
have
to
interpret
him
not
infrequently
to
make
sense
of
his
record
the
second
is
the
fact
that
the
chronicler
will
give
some
particular
spot
quite
consonant
with
the
marching
powers
of
troops
for
one
day
but
different
from
that
given
by
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
this
apparent
discrepancy
is
due
to
the
fact
that
an
army
marches
if
it
can
upon
parallel
roads
involving
various
for
various
sections
of
it
on
the
same
night
an
army
upon
a
raid
such
as
this
also
throws
out
foraging
parties
and
detachments
which
leave
its
main
body
for
the
purposes
of
observation
or
of
plunder
again
we
must
always
regard
the
king
household
and
therefore
the
kitchen
accounts
as
moving
with
what
may
be
called
the
staff
often
therefore
it
will
go
much
faster
than
the
rest
of
the
army
while
at
other
times
it
will
lie
behind
or
to
one
side
of
it
thus
at
the
very
end
of
this
campaign
you
have
a
transference
of
the
king
quarters
twenty
miles
to
the
north
in
one
day
which
would
be
a
terribly
long
march
for
the
army
as
a
whole
and
which
as
a
fact
we
can
discover
on
other
evidence
the
army
as
a
whole
did
not
take
with
so
much
said
we
can
proceed
to
build
up
an
exact
account
of
the
advance
and
the
retreat
upon
sunday
the
of
august
edward
advanced
from
st
lô
to
a
place
which
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
calls
sevances
the
spelling
is
inaccurate
the
place
intended
is
twelve
miles
to
the
south
and
east
of
st
lô
but
other
portions
of
the
army
halted
elsewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
as
we
know
from
baker
the
next
halt
that
of
the
is
at
torteval
only
five
miles
away
but
a
portion
of
the
army
got
south
of
fontenay
le
pesnel
which
the
king
did
not
reach
till
the
and
which
the
clerk
calls
funtenay
paynel
three
days
are
thus
taken
between
st
lô
and
caen
and
the
whole
army
arrives
before
the
latter
large
town
the
capital
of
west
normandy
upon
wednesday
july
the
town
of
caen
was
not
properly
defended
it
had
no
regular
walls
and
was
a
very
rich
prey
indeed
the
constable
of
france
and
the
chamberlain
were
in
the
town
and
the
castle
was
held
by
a
handful
of
genoese
mercenaries
there
was
an
armed
force
of
militia
and
of
knights
in
the
streets
of
the
town
of
what
exact
size
we
do
not
know
the
prince
of
wales
with
the
advance
guard
occupied
the
outskirts
of
the
city
which
lie
beyond
the
branches
of
the
orne
the
northern
branch
now
runs
mainly
in
sewers
under
the
streets
from
the
hôtel
de
ville
to
the
church
of
st
peter
there
was
sharp
fighting
at
the
bridge
at
one
moment
of
which
the
king
ordered
a
retreat
but
the
earl
of
warwick
disobeyed
the
order
the
king
followed
him
and
the
bridge
was
taken
there
was
considerable
slaughter
in
the
streets
of
the
city
the
constable
and
the
chamberlain
were
taken
prisoners
and
about
one
hundred
of
the
wounded
knights
the
english
loss
which
was
not
heavy
fell
mainly
upon
the
archers
and
spearmen
and
the
total
including
wounded
was
but
five
hundred
and
was
mainly
due
to
the
resistance
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
houses
the
town
was
given
over
to
pillage
and
edward
thought
of
burning
it
but
was
restrained
it
is
characteristic
of
the
march
that
a
delay
of
four
days
from
the
morning
of
the
was
occupied
in
the
loot
of
caen
from
which
town
in
communication
with
the
sea
by
its
river
edward
sent
back
his
plunder
on
board
the
fleet
which
he
dismissed
the
army
marched
out
of
caen
on
monday
the
of
july
and
undertook
its
three
days
march
to
lisieux
the
next
rich
town
upon
this
random
advance
now
deprived
of
support
from
the
sea
edward
probably
intended
to
force
some
passage
of
the
seine
preferably
it
may
be
surmised
at
rouen
or
a
little
higher
up
with
the
vague
object
of
making
for
the
and
calais
we
are
not
certain
of
this
it
is
more
than
possible
that
the
capture
of
calais
later
on
in
the
campaign
gave
rise
to
the
story
that
some
such
plan
was
intended
anyhow
we
get
two
halts
and
three
marches
between
caen
and
lisieux
a
distance
of
only
miles
which
could
easily
have
been
accomplished
in
two
days
had
there
been
a
really
definite
plan
in
the
commander
head
we
may
be
pretty
certain
that
there
was
not
the
halts
of
the
king
himself
on
the
of
july
and
the
of
august
were
made
at
two
places
which
read
in
the
as
treward
and
an
abbreviated
name
which
stands
for
leopurtuis
the
first
of
these
is
troarn
at
the
crossing
of
the
dives
river
other
forces
halted
on
that
night
at
agences
four
miles
to
the
south
the
second
is
léaupartie
a
mile
or
so
from
rumenise
where
one
other
column
halted
while
a
second
column
camped
about
five
miles
to
the
south
lisieux
was
entered
upon
the
of
august
after
a
march
of
ten
miles
on
the
part
of
the
king
and
of
eleven
and
twelve
on
the
part
of
the
other
two
bodies
at
lisieux
two
cardinals
who
were
despatched
to
offer
terms
met
king
edward
and
proposed
this
arrangement
to
complete
the
war
that
he
should
have
the
duchy
of
aquitaine
upon
the
same
tenure
as
his
ancestors
had
held
it
he
refused
those
terms
and
after
wasting
a
day
at
lisieux
continued
his
march
eastward
leaving
lisieux
on
the
morning
of
the
he
pitched
his
tent
that
evening
at
duramelle
a
march
of
nine
miles
with
at
least
one
column
a
mile
ahead
at
le
teil
on
saturday
the
he
got
something
better
out
of
his
troops
or
at
any
rate
out
of
the
vanguard
and
made
something
like
seventeen
miles
to
neubourg
i
confess
here
to
a
very
considerable
doubt
the
entry
in
the
accounts
of
the
kitchen
is
hopelessly
misspelt
but
the
lineubourg
does
not
correspond
to
any
other
possible
place
and
le
neubourg
would
be
a
very
convenient
for
the
king
himself
well
provisioned
and
lodged
we
can
not
believe
of
course
that
the
army
covered
the
full
distance
but
there
is
no
reason
why
the
king
and
his
household
should
not
have
pushed
on
ahead
with
mounted
troops
what
makes
it
more
probable
is
that
the
king
spent
the
whole
day
of
sunday
the
at
le
neubourg
presumably
for
the
bulk
of
the
army
to
come
up
and
make
two
days
march
of
the
twenty
odd
miles
which
the
most
distant
contingents
had
to
cover
it
was
on
the
next
day
monday
the
that
he
reached
the
seine
and
approached
that
river
as
we
may
presume
with
the
object
of
crossing
it
it
was
a
march
and
the
whole
force
could
be
on
the
banks
before
evening
at
elboeuf
but
the
bridges
were
broken
and
it
was
impossible
it
was
from
this
point
of
elboeuf
that
the
raid
turned
to
follow
the
valley
of
the
seine
up
towards
paris
always
seeking
some
and
always
finding
the
bridges
broken
the
nearer
he
got
to
paris
the
more
dangerous
became
edward
position
and
the
larger
grew
the
forces
of
the
french
king
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
capital
which
threatened
him
tuesday
the
was
spent
in
ravaging
the
country
pont
de
was
burnt
in
revenge
for
the
destruction
of
its
bridge
a
detachment
went
round
by
louviers
which
was
looted
but
the
king
himself
went
forward
by
the
river
bank
and
lodged
that
night
at
vaudreuil
ten
miles
on
from
elboeuf
which
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
calls
the
bulk
of
the
force
halted
at
léry
a
mile
or
two
behind
upon
wednesday
august
edward
lay
at
angreville
the
langville
of
the
accounts
just
south
of
gaillon
and
on
thursday
the
having
burnt
vernon
where
he
found
the
bridge
cut
at
jeufose
rather
more
than
eleven
miles
march
up
the
river
frevose
as
i
read
it
in
the
his
next
hope
for
a
bridge
was
at
mantes
and
he
was
getting
perilously
near
the
heart
of
the
country
and
the
gathering
french
forces
that
bridge
was
nine
or
ten
miles
along
the
road
he
found
it
cut
like
all
the
others
he
was
already
across
the
borders
of
normandy
and
anxiety
must
have
been
growing
upon
him
he
seized
mantes
after
some
resistance
it
was
useless
to
his
purpose
and
he
hurried
on
another
six
miles
to
epone
appone
in
the
accounts
making
that
day
a
really
long
march
in
his
natural
haste
and
compelling
his
escort
to
the
same
sixteen
miles
but
he
both
fatigued
his
main
army
in
that
attempt
and
it
also
lost
some
time
in
storming
a
fortified
house
on
the
white
rock
because
the
next
day
he
evidently
had
to
wait
for
stragglers
to
come
up
advancing
but
a
couple
of
miles
to
aubergenville
where
we
find
him
upon
saturday
the
upon
the
the
sunday
he
got
his
opportunity
a
march
of
only
eight
miles
brought
the
host
to
poissy
and
there
though
the
bridge
was
cut
the
stone
piles
upon
which
its
trestles
had
stood
were
uninjured
edward
at
once
began
to
take
advantage
of
this
and
to
put
his
artificers
to
work
all
that
sunday
and
all
the
monday
the
task
proceeded
and
during
this
delay
parties
were
despatched
to
ravage
they
burnt
st
germain
and
st
cloud
an
advance
party
entered
the
bois
de
boulogne
but
there
could
of
course
be
no
thought
of
an
attack
on
paris
with
so
small
a
force
and
without
base
or
provision
by
tuesday
the
of
august
these
ravaging
parties
were
recalled
and
the
whole
host
was
streaming
across
the
repaired
bridge
at
poissy
this
day
tuesday
the
is
strategically
the
turning
point
of
the
campaign
in
an
attempt
to
note
in
history
no
more
than
the
great
raid
of
edward
up
to
the
very
walls
of
the
capital
and
his
rapid
and
successful
retreat
the
crossing
of
poissy
would
form
the
central
term
of
our
story
as
it
happened
however
the
great
chance
which
occurred
to
edward
in
that
retreat
upon
the
field
of
crécy
and
his
magnificent
use
of
it
has
eclipsed
the
earlier
story
and
for
many
the
interest
of
the
campaign
as
a
whole
and
the
importance
of
this
rapid
seizure
and
repair
of
poissy
is
missed
while
his
army
was
crossing
the
river
edward
received
the
challenge
of
the
king
of
france
it
was
native
indeed
to
the
time
a
sort
of
offering
the
english
monarch
battle
upon
any
one
of
five
days
in
that
great
plain
between
paris
and
st
germains
which
the
last
siege
of
the
french
capital
has
rendered
famous
in
military
history
the
french
feudal
levies
for
which
philip
had
been
waiting
were
now
fast
gathering
especially
those
for
which
he
had
had
to
wait
longest
the
main
forces
which
had
been
away
down
south
in
guienne
edward
most
wisely
refused
the
challenge
for
it
would
have
been
against
great
odds
and
to
accept
though
consonant
to
the
spirit
of
the
time
would
have
been
a
ludicrously
unmilitary
proceeding
in
place
of
such
acceptation
he
sent
back
false
news
that
he
would
meet
philip
far
to
the
south
he
then
proceeded
to
cross
the
river
and
make
the
best
haste
he
could
back
northwards
to
the
sea
the
french
king
found
out
the
trick
a
day
and
a
half
late
he
started
in
pursuit
with
his
large
and
increasing
host
that
host
was
gathered
at
st
denis
when
on
the
wednesday
night
the
edward
had
got
his
men
to
grisy
well
north
of
pontoise
and
something
like
seventeen
miles
by
cross
roads
from
his
hastily
repaired
bridge
across
the
seine
what
followed
was
a
fine
feat
of
marching
on
the
next
day
the
he
had
got
his
forces
more
than
another
seventeen
miles
north
and
had
camped
them
by
auneuil
in
two
more
days
by
the
evening
of
saturday
the
they
were
yet
miles
further
north
as
the
crow
flies
and
more
like
thirty
by
the
roads
at
sommereux
edward
halted
at
troussures
of
which
the
clerk
makes
trusserux
to
see
it
file
by
and
on
the
morrow
sunday
august
the
he
was
at
camps
in
the
upland
above
moliens
vidame
another
push
of
fifteen
miles
for
mass
of
the
force
and
of
more
than
twenty
for
himself
and
his
staff
at
this
point
came
the
crux
of
his
danger
all
during
that
tremendous
feat
of
marching
and
what
it
meant
anyone
who
has
covered
close
on
fifty
miles
in
three
days
under
military
conditions
will
know
there
are
few
such
the
great
host
of
philip
was
pounding
at
his
heels
now
if
the
reader
will
glance
at
the
map
at
the
beginning
of
this
section
he
will
see
that
just
as
edward
had
been
under
a
necessity
to
cross
the
seine
in
the
first
part
of
his
raid
he
was
now
under
a
still
greater
necessity
of
crossing
the
somme
a
force
much
larger
than
his
own
was
pressing
him
against
that
river
into
a
sort
of
corner
and
his
only
chance
of
safety
lay
in
reaching
the
straits
of
dover
through
the
county
of
ponthieu
which
lay
beyond
the
stream
every
effort
had
been
made
to
press
the
march
the
force
appears
to
have
been
divided
for
this
purpose
and
to
have
marched
in
parallel
columns
and
the
single
case
of
marauding
the
burning
of
the
abbey
of
st
lucien
outside
beauvais
had
been
punished
with
the
death
of
twenty
men
to
turn
and
meet
his
pursuers
who
were
evidently
in
contact
with
him
through
their
scouts
would
have
meant
so
long
as
he
was
on
this
side
of
the
somme
no
chance
of
retreat
in
case
of
defeat
every
mile
he
went
to
the
north
the
somme
valley
already
a
broad
expanse
of
marsh
upon
his
flank
grew
broader
and
more
difficult
the
decision
therefore
which
edward
took
at
this
critical
moment
at
once
perilous
and
masterly
showed
that
rapid
grasp
of
a
situation
which
for
all
his
lack
of
a
general
plan
during
this
campaign
this
great
soldier
could
boast
in
the
first
place
he
himself
rides
forward
no
less
than
twenty
full
miles
to
the
village
of
acheux
he
has
behind
him
the
whole
army
strung
out
in
separate
bodies
parallel
to
the
somme
himself
from
the
head
of
that
long
line
of
twenty
miles
commands
all
that
should
be
done
along
it
he
next
orders
separate
bodies
to
approach
the
valley
and
seek
a
crossing
first
if
possible
up
river
then
as
they
fail
lower
and
lower
down
and
each
to
be
ready
as
it
is
foiled
at
each
bridge
to
fall
back
north
in
concentration
and
to
group
in
gathering
numbers
further
and
further
down
the
stream
and
near
to
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
line
acheux
the
whole
thing
is
a
fine
piece
of
sudden
decision
and
is
at
once
a
combination
of
the
rapidity
of
the
retreat
and
of
the
attempt
to
force
the
river
in
this
the
fourth
week
of
august
which
so
nearly
brought
disaster
to
the
english
force
three
days
the
and
were
taken
up
in
this
manoeuvre
the
english
flung
themselves
successively
against
the
bridges
picquigny
long
pré
pont
rémy
the
hardest
and
first
push
was
at
picquigny
at
the
beginning
or
southernmost
of
the
effort
the
body
detached
for
that
effort
was
beaten
back
it
was
the
same
with
the
next
blow
lower
down
at
long
pré
the
same
lower
down
still
at
pont
rémy
at
no
bridge
were
the
english
successful
everywhere
the
valley
was
impassable
to
them
and
as
they
attempted
one
place
after
another
down
the
stream
with
its
broadening
marshland
and
now
tidal
water
to
find
a
traverse
seemed
impossible
at
last
then
upon
wednesday
the
of
august
the
whole
host
was
gathered
foiled
round
its
king
at
acheux
he
marched
on
a
few
miles
to
boismont
going
on
his
way
through
mons
and
there
as
it
chanced
picking
up
a
prisoner
who
proved
invaluable
for
that
prisoner
betrayed
the
ford
as
the
english
army
lay
at
boismont
that
night
of
the
the
broad
estuary
of
the
somme
stretched
to
the
north
of
them
with
no
more
bridges
across
it
cut
or
uncut
and
apparently
no
fate
but
a
choice
between
a
desperate
action
against
superior
numbers
nor
any
retreat
open
and
surrender
edward
only
chance
lay
in
the
discovery
across
that
mile
of
land
flooded
at
high
tide
and
at
low
tide
a
morass
of
some
kind
of
ford
such
a
ford
existed
with
difficulty
but
in
the
nick
of
time
it
was
discovered
and
used
the
french
force
defending
it
upon
the
further
side
was
overthrown
and
the
retreat
and
its
dependent
victory
of
crécy
were
made
possible
edward
had
had
good
faith
that
god
and
our
lady
and
st
george
would
find
him
a
passage
and
a
passage
he
found
the
crossing
of
that
ford
and
the
advance
to
crécy
field
must
form
the
matter
of
our
next
section
the
preliminaries
of
the
action
the
reader
will
note
that
in
the
latter
part
of
the
above
i
have
wholly
abandoned
the
more
usual
account
of
the
last
three
days
of
the
retreat
from
poissy
to
the
somme
and
that
the
reconstruction
i
have
attempted
includes
several
matters
hitherto
not
suggested
in
any
recent
history
and
is
in
contradiction
with
the
view
which
has
hitherto
been
most
generally
accepted
the
evidence
upon
which
i
rely
for
this
description
of
the
retreat
on
acheux
and
subsequently
on
boismont
will
i
hope
be
found
set
out
in
detail
in
the
number
of
the
historical
for
october
meanwhile
i
owe
it
to
my
readers
who
may
use
this
book
for
purposes
of
school
or
university
work
to
state
briefly
the
way
in
which
the
matter
has
hitherto
been
set
forth
and
my
reason
for
adopting
this
new
version
most
froissart
which
have
misled
history
in
this
regard
say
that
king
edward
was
at
upon
the
evening
of
the
lingard
the
father
of
all
modern
english
historical
writing
and
a
man
whom
every
historian
begins
by
reading
though
very
few
go
on
by
acknowledging
him
expanded
this
mere
reference
into
a
whole
phrase
and
wrote
that
edward
had
the
good
fortune
to
capture
the
town
of
oisemont
and
so
find
a
night
lodging
a
neglect
of
military
conditions
or
of
the
map
or
of
both
has
perpetuated
the
error
edward
was
never
at
oisemont
the
argument
against
it
and
in
favour
of
is
dependent
upon
a
number
of
converging
proofs
which
i
will
very
briefly
recapitulate
the
mss
of
froissart
are
none
of
them
original
they
vary
among
themselves
with
regard
to
this
particular
word
most
of
them
giving
oisemont
but
one
giving
nysemont
even
where
all
the
mss
agree
with
regard
to
a
place
and
where
froissart
certainly
mentioned
it
he
is
wildly
inaccurate
evidently
going
by
hearsay
and
often
by
a
doubtful
memory
thus
he
has
no
idea
on
which
side
of
the
seine
the
town
of
gisors
stands
and
he
calls
the
village
of
fontaine
a
strong
town
etc
even
were
he
an
accurate
he
is
not
a
contemporary
authority
he
had
to
depend
entirely
upon
older
accounts
which
we
can
prove
that
he
misread
or
did
not
read
at
all
but
only
heard
spoken
of
and
very
often
botched
horribly
in
this
particular
campaign
he
is
particularly
haphazard
thus
upon
the
point
of
the
order
in
which
the
various
crossings
of
the
somme
were
attempted
he
gets
them
at
sixes
and
sevens
describing
the
first
last
and
the
last
first
he
was
a
man
always
attending
to
picturesqueness
of
incident
and
one
who
thought
exactitude
very
negligible
those
are
the
five
points
which
weaken
any
positive
evidence
which
froissart
may
give
but
it
is
the
evidence
independent
of
froissart
and
of
his
accuracy
or
inaccuracy
which
is
so
overwhelming
oisemont
lies
actually
ten
miles
from
abbeville
upon
the
line
of
the
retreat
to
occupy
oisemont
was
to
incur
a
deliberate
running
into
that
danger
which
it
was
all
edward
effort
to
avoid
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
philip
the
king
of
france
was
before
the
night
of
the
abreast
of
abbeville
a
retreat
upon
oisemont
would
therefore
have
been
physically
impossible
to
edward
oisemont
would
have
involved
keeping
in
touch
with
bodies
ten
twelve
fifteen
and
twenty
miles
distant
even
if
oisemont
had
been
occupied
for
two
days
whereas
the
only
mention
we
have
of
that
occupation
represents
it
as
taking
place
on
the
these
three
points
render
it
as
to
two
of
them
morally
impossible
as
to
one
of
them
physically
that
edward
could
have
been
at
oisemont
upon
that
night
but
they
are
negative
we
have
positive
points
which
clinch
the
whole
matter
these
are
edward
marched
with
his
army
to
the
ford
or
it
could
not
all
have
crossed
therefore
it
was
concentrated
before
he
marched
the
march
was
a
very
short
one
even
froissart
says
that
he
started
at
the
break
of
day
and
reached
the
ford
a
little
after
sunrise
it
must
also
have
been
short
because
we
know
as
a
matter
of
positive
history
that
the
soldiers
who
took
that
morning
march
waited
some
time
for
the
tide
to
ebb
fought
a
sharp
and
successful
action
upon
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
and
again
on
the
same
day
stormed
certainly
one
and
possibly
two
defended
places
also
that
their
total
march
before
the
night
and
beyond
the
river
was
quite
ten
miles
including
the
actions
just
mentioned
we
also
know
that
there
was
an
assault
on
st
valery
which
was
actually
miles
from
oisemont
by
the
nearest
roads
we
know
that
the
traitor
was
captured
at
mons
which
if
edward
had
been
at
oisemont
would
have
meant
that
someone
had
not
only
caught
him
at
that
great
distance
from
oisemont
but
had
brought
him
back
a
total
ride
of
miles
without
previous
knowledge
that
he
was
capable
of
the
valuable
information
he
only
gave
later
and
after
offers
there
is
no
contemporary
mention
of
oisemont
but
we
do
positively
know
from
contemporary
evidence
that
the
king
household
was
and
had
been
for
three
days
at
acheux
now
all
this
combined
is
quite
conclusive
oisemont
is
impossible
boismont
satisfies
every
part
of
the
evidence
an
hour
riding
from
it
permits
the
attack
on
st
valery
mons
where
the
traitor
comes
from
is
only
two
miles
off
the
march
from
boismont
to
the
ford
is
just
such
an
advance
as
would
take
the
dawn
and
sunrise
of
a
day
whereas
the
advance
from
oisemont
impossible
for
all
those
other
reasons
would
involve
fourteen
to
fifteen
miles
of
marching
and
is
utterly
incompatible
with
the
idea
of
two
or
possibly
three
heavy
fights
and
the
long
march
succeeding
it
one
last
piece
of
evidence
would
be
conclusive
even
if
we
had
not
all
the
rest
there
is
contemporary
record
of
the
mayor
of
abbeville
watching
from
the
heights
of
caubert
hill
the
english
army
streaming
northward
to
concentrate
round
the
advanced
position
of
the
king
from
that
height
such
an
advance
could
be
discerned
crossing
the
plateau
which
leads
to
acheux
to
mons
and
to
boismont
you
could
no
more
see
a
concentration
on
oisemont
from
it
than
you
could
see
a
concentration
on
greenwich
from
camden

the
preliminaries
of
the
battle
the
manoeuvres
of
the
french
and
english
armies
preliminary
to
the
battle
of
crécy
are
so
instructive
upon
many
points
involved
movements
so
hazardous
and
so
complex
gave
rise
to
so
sharp
a
series
of
engagements
and
form
in
general
so
large
a
part
of
our
subject
that
they
merit
a
far
larger
study
than
do
the
approaches
to
most
battles
they
illustrate
the
comparative
lack
of
plan
which
characterised
medieval
warfare
they
afford
a
contrast
between
the
compact
and
fairly
well
organised
command
of
edward
and
the
chaotic
host
of
the
king
of
france
they
show
the
effect
upon
the
military
profession
of
a
time
without
maps
and
without
any
properly
managed
system
of
intelligence
and
above
all
they
show
the
overwhelming
part
which
chance
plays
in
all
armed
conflict
between
forces
of
the
same
civilisation
and
approximately
the
same
aptitudes
the
situation
upon
wednesday
the
of
august
at
which
point
we
concluded
the
survey
of
edward
iii
great
raid
through
normandy
and
of
his
retreat
down
the
line
of
the
somme
is
already
known
to
the
reader
and
will
be
the
clearer
if
he
will
look
at
the
map
upon
page
edward
had
made
a
very
fine
march
indeed
not
only
averaging
something
like
twelve
miles
a
day
or
more
but
arranging
for
expeditions
to
leave
the
main
host
during
the
latter
part
of
this
rapid
retreat
and
attempt
to
force
at
various
points
the
passages
of
the
river
somme
we
have
seen
that
he
was
compelled
if
possible
to
force
a
passage
because
he
would
otherwise
find
himself
shut
up
between
the
somme
and
the
sea
with
a
much
superior
force
cutting
him
off
to
the
south
in
case
of
defeat
he
would
have
no
line
of
retreat
and
even
in
case
of
success
unless
that
success
were
overwhelming
he
would
find
himself
strategically
stalemated
still
caught
in
a
trap
and
still
doomed
to
await
the
next
onslaught
of
the
enemy
we
have
further
seen
that
with
every
mile
that
he
proceeded
towards
the
sea
his
ability
to
cross
the
somme
decreased
the
river
runs
through
a
marshy
valley
which
even
is
a
mass
of
ponds
and
water
meadows
and
which
then
was
a
belt
of
marsh
it
is
bounded
on
either
side
by
fairly
steep
banks
rising
to
heights
of
and
feet
and
inland
to
between
which
the
flat
swamped
land
grows
broader
and
broader
as
one
approaches
the
sea
at
picquigny
this
level
belt
of
swamp
through
which
the
somme
twines
is
quite
yards
across
at
long
pré
it
is
nearer
below
abbeville
it
is
and
at
the
point
whence
edward
overlooked
it
when
he
was
halted
at
bay
on
the
evening
of
that
of
august
it
is
well
over
yards
in
width
and
nearer
boismont
a
village
climbing
the
southern
bank
of
the
estuary
was
the
spot
on
which
the
king
had
gathered
the
army
upon
the
evening
of
that
wednesday
and
not
a
day
march
behind
him
the
most
advanced
mounted
men
of
his
pursuers
with
the
king
of
france
among
them
were
camping
the
peril
was
extreme
and
an
issue
from
that
peril
as
extremely
doubtful
it
was
hopeless
for
the
army
to
attempt
to
retrace
its
steps
to
the
upper
river
to
have
done
so
would
have
been
to
march
with
the
flank
of
its
march
exposed
to
an
immediate
advance
of
french
forces
and
almost
certainly
to
be
caught
in
column
and
edward
had
already
suffered
such
repulses
before
long
pré
pont
rémy
and
picquigny
as
left
him
no
hope
for
success
should
he
attempt
these
bridges
again
his
only
chance
was
to
find
if
it
were
possible
some
practicable
ford
across
the
broad
estuary
itself
that
lay
before
him
the
moon
was
within
a
few
hours
of
the
full
that
night
the
highest
of
the
was
making
in
the
open
sea
they
were
at
their
full
height
of
feet
an
hour
before
midnight
and
though
where
he
would
strike
the
estuary
he
might
hope
for
a
tide
more
tardy
edward
had
before
him
as
he
watched
his
only
avenue
of
escape
a
great
flood
that
appeared
to
deny
him
all
access
to
the
further
shore
every
effort
was
made
to
discover
from
local
knowledge
whether
any
passage
existed
the
highest
rewards
were
offered
in
vain
for
in
all
that
countryside
a
feeling
which
if
not
national
was
at
least
strongly
opposed
to
the
invader
forbade
treason
and
the
near
presence
of
the
french
king
great
force
was
an
active
reminder
of
the
punishment
that
would
attend
it
late
in
this
period
of
suspense
a
guide
was
found
a
man
of
the
name
of
gobin
agache
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
army
was
that
guide
his
was
that
invaluable
capture
which
i
mentioned
in
the
last
section
he
was
a
peasant
of
those
parts
and
a
native
of
through
which
the
army
had
marched
from
acheux
to
boismont
he
yielded
to
temptation
when
all
others
had
refused
he
was
promised
a
hundred
pieces
of
gold
say
of
our
money
his
own
liberty
and
that
of
twenty
of
his
companions
for
that
price
he
sold
himself
and
promised
to
discover
to
the
king
and
to
his
army
the
only
practicable
ford
across
the
estuary
just
at
the
end
of
the
night
the
host
set
out
and
marched
during
the
first
hours
of
the
moonlit
wednesday
morning
along
the
old
road
which
still
leads
over
the
hills
that
separate
boismont
from
saigneville
and
marked
the
southern
bank
of
the
valley
the
marshalling
was
long
the
full
ordering
of
the
force
now
that
it
was
all
gathered
together
and
marching
along
one
narrow
way
inexpeditious
and
the
two
miles
that
separated
the
head
of
its
column
from
the
neighbouring
village
were
not
traversed
by
its
last
units
nor
was
the
whole
body
drawn
up
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
against
the
water
until
the
sun
of
that
late
august
day
was
beginning
to
rise
and
to
show
more
clearly
the
great
sheet
of
and
the
steep
distant
bank
beyond
it
the
place
to
which
their
guide
had
led
them
was
the
entry
to
the
ford
of
blanchetaque
a
name
famous
in
the
military
history
of
this
country
hidden
beneath
the
waters
which
though
now
ebbing
strongly
were
still
far
too
deep
for
any
attempt
at
a
crossing
ran
the
causeway
by
it
upon
the
faith
of
the
traitor
they
could
trust
to
gaining
the
opposite
shore
as
the
racing
ebb
lowered
more
and
more
the
landward
approaches
of
that
causeway
appeared
in
a
lengthening
white
belt
pointing
right
across
towards
the
further
bank
and
assured
them
that
they
had
not
been
betrayed
it
was
built
of
firm
marl
in
the
midst
of
that
grassy
slime
which
marks
the
edges
of
the
somme
valley
and
they
had
but
to
wait
for
low
water
to
be
certain
that
they
could
make
the
passage
beyond
upon
the
northern
shore
which
showed
in
a
high
black
band
for
it
was
steep
against
the
broadening
day
they
could
distinguish
a
force
that
had
been
gathered
to
oppose
them
it
was
before
the
ebb
was
at
its
lowest
and
they
could
begin
to
march
twelve
abreast
and
with
the
water
no
more
than
across
the
dwindled
stream
now
at
its
lowermost
of
slack
water
and
running
near
the
further
bank
with
a
breadth
not
a
fifth
of
what
it
had
been
at
the
flood
but
before
proceeding
further
and
describing
the
assault
shore
i
would
lay
before
my
readers
the
process
by
which
i
have
established
the
exact
locality
of
this
famous
ford
it
has
been
a
matter
of
considerable
historical
debate
it
is
and
will
always
remain
a
matter
of
high
historical
interest
and
this
must
be
my
excuse
for
digressing
upon
the
evidence
which
i
think
it
will
be
admitted
finally
establishes
the
exact
trajectory
of
blanchetaque
the
site
of
blanchetaque
is
one
which
nature
and
art
have
combined
to
render
obscure
nature
because
a
ford
when
its
purpose
disappears
and
it
is
no
longer
kept
up
that
is
an
artificial
ford
tends
to
disappear
more
rapidly
than
any
other
monument
art
because
the
old
estuary
of
the
somme
has
of
recent
years
been
further
and
further
reclaimed
it
was
when
i
first
began
studying
this
district
already
banked
across
below
boismont
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
great
railway
bridge
right
across
the
very
mouth
of
the
river
has
in
the
last
few
months
been
made
the
boundary
of
the
reclaimed
land
now
blanchetaque
was
an
artificial
ford
we
know
this
because
there
is
no
marl
formation
near
by
and
could
be
none
forming
a
narrow
rib
across
the
deep
alluvial
mud
of
the
estuary
the
marl
then
can
only
have
been
brought
from
some
little
distance
it
is
not
only
an
artificial
hardening
which
we
have
to
deal
with
but
one
in
the
midst
of
a
tidal
estuary
where
a
violent
current
swept
the
work
for
centuries
finally
the
cause
for
keeping
the
ford
in
some
sort
of
repair
early
disappeared
in
modern
times
before
the
process
of
reclaiming
the
land
of
the
estuary
began
numerous
modern
bridges
coupled
with
the
great
development
of
modern
roads
permitted
the
crossing
of
the
somme
at
and
below
abbeville
notably
the
bridge
of
cambron
the
railway
the
growth
of
the
tonnage
of
steamers
and
other
causes
led
to
the
decline
of
the
little
riverside
town
of
port
formerly
the
secure
head
of
marine
navigation
upon
the
river
and
largely
the
cause
that
blanchetaque
was
kept
in
repair
again
the
reclamation
of
the
land
has
been
carried
out
with
a
french
thoroughness
only
too
successful
in
destroying
the
contours
of
the
old
river
bed
in
the
sketch
map
on
i
have
indicated
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
channel
of
the
river
at
low
tide
as
it
appears
to
have
been
before
reclamation
began
but
even
this
can
barely
be
traced
upon
the
levelled
heightened
and
now
fruitful
pastures
it
is
all
this
which
has
made
the
exact
emplacement
of
blanchetaque
so
difficult
to
ascertain
and
has
led
to
the
controversies
upon
its
site
now
if
we
will
proceed
to
gather
all
forms
of
evidence
we
shall
find
that
they
converge
upon
one
particular
line
of
trajectory
which
in
the
end
we
can
regard
as
completely
established
we
have
in
the
first
place
and
most
valuable
of
all
of
course
tradition
local
traditions
luckily
carefully
gathered
as
late
as
but
the
indications
of
the
peasants
pointing
out
the
traditional
site
of
the
then
ruined
way
were
unfortunately
not
marked
on
a
map
what
done
was
to
give
an
indication
unfortunately
not
too
precise
and
to
leave
it
on
record
that
the
northern
end
of
the
ford
was
from
to
metres
below
port
this
gives
us
a
margin
of
possible
error
not
of
yards
as
might
be
supposed
but
of
more
than
double
that
distance
for
port
itself
is
yards
in
length
from
east
to
west
we
can
be
certain
however
that
so
far
as
tradition
goes
we
need
not
look
more
than
a
mile
below
port
for
the
ford
nor
less
than
say
half
a
mile
from
its
last
houses
fortunately
we
have
other
convergent
indications
which
can
guide
us
with
greater
precision
we
must
remember
that
apart
from
the
bringing
of
merchandise
over
to
the
neighbourhood
of
port
the
ford
which
may
and
most
probably
did
exist
before
port
became
of
any
importance
led
all
the
central
traffic
of
the
vimieux
country
which
is
the
district
on
the
left
bank
of
the
somme
towards
the
straits
of
dover
and
their
principal
port
at
boulogne
now
the
way
from
the
right
bank
of
the
somme
to
boulogne
is
interrupted
by
several
streams
much
the
most
marshy
and
broad
of
which
is
the
authie
the
romans
bridged
the
authie
at
in
the
course
of
their
great
trunk
road
to
britain
and
any
way
which
led
from
the
lowest
ford
over
the
somme
to
boulogne
would
have
to
join
that
great
trunk
road
before
or
at
the
bridge
if
it
were
to
take
advantage
as
commerce
would
have
to
do
of
that
sole
passage
of
the
very
difficult
and
marshy
authie
valley
which
can
nowhere
be
crossed
save
upon
a
causeway
i
have
in
a
former
page
remarked
upon
the
importance
of
ad
pontes
the
modern
ponches
and
pointed
out
that
it
gives
the
whole
county
its
name
of
ponthieu
we
must
expect
therefore
any
direct
commercial
way
northward
from
the
ford
to
make
directly
for
ponches
to
strike
the
great
trunk
road
higher
up
would
be
to
go
out
of
one
way
to
strike
it
lower
down
would
be
to
strike
the
authie
valley
at
an
impassable
point
when
an
ancient
way
has
disappeared
certain
indications
of
its
track
especially
as
that
track
may
be
presumed
to
be
direct
survive
and
among
these
are
wayside
tombs
parish
boundaries
and
mills
or
other
places
which
for
the
conveyance
of
heavy
merchandise
are
placed
near
such
a
road
if
possible
all
these
three
kinds
of
indications
are
available
in
this
particular
case
the
medieval
mill
which
was
so
important
a
monopoly
of
the
medieval
community
was
not
built
in
the
most
natural
place
for
it
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
just
above
port
but
some
thousand
yards
and
more
away
down
the
river
bank
and
over
against
it
is
a
group
of
tombs
moreover
between
the
two
runs
the
long
boundary
of
the
parish
or
commune
of
port
which
is
prolonged
in
the
boundary
of
the
parish
of
sailly
we
have
here
then
a
convergence
of
proof
which
confirms
the
vaguer
traditional
site
for
the
end
of
this
line
upon
the
river
passing
between
the
tombs
and
the
old
mill
strikes
the
bank
within
the
limits
of
distance
from
port
which
were
set
down
in
the
local
notes
printed
in
but
there
is
more
the
forming
of
successive
embankments
one
below
the
other
for
the
gradual
reclamation
of
land
in
the
somme
estuary
was
not
an
easy
matter
they
had
to
be
strong
to
withstand
a
strong
tide
and
there
was
no
good
bottom
to
be
found
in
the
deep
mud
of
the
valley
floor
it
is
a
significant
evidence
of
this
difficulty
that
the
embankments
stand
so
far
apart
and
that
the
last
has
had
to
take
advantage
of
the
work
of
the
railway
viaduct
it
is
therefore
a
legitimate
conjecture
that
the
hard
bottom
afforded
by
the
old
blanchetaque
would
be
made
use
of
and
as
a
fact
we
find
the
principal
embankment
between
port
and
the
sea
coinciding
exactly
with
the
line
established
by
the
tombs
the
parish
boundaries
and
the
site
of
the
mill
there
is
even
more
than
this
if
we
follow
the
present
embankment
across
the
estuary
towards
the
southern
bank
we
find
ourselves
checked
before
reaching
that
bank
by
the
now
canalised
and
artificial
straight
ditch
of
the
somme
there
is
no
bridge
but
on
the
further
side
leading
across
the
remaining
yards
to
the
southern
bank
a
village
road
exactly
continues
the
direction
and
this
road
older
than
the
reclamation
of
the
valley
is
the
last
converging
point
clinching
the
argument
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
road
leading
from
saigneville
northward
across
the
flat
to
the
canal
and
continued
beyond
the
canal
by
the
embankment
is
the
line
of
the
old
blanchetaque
though
the
french
army
had
been
pursuing
edward
during
his
march
upon
the
left
bank
of
the
somme
the
possibility
of
his
getting
across
the
estuary
had
not
been
neglected
and
a
force
had
been
detached
to
watch
the
right
bank
at
the
point
where
the
only
passage
across
the
stream
blanchetaque
touched
that
right
bank
here
one
of
philip
nobles
godemard
de
fay
was
waiting
with
a
considerable
force
to
oppose
the
passage
the
exact
size
of
this
force
is
not
easy
to
determine
for
it
is
variously
stated
even
by
contemporary
authorities
but
we
are
fairly
safe
if
we
reckon
it
at
more
than
and
less
than
men
some
hundreds
of
whom
were
mounted
knights
in
other
words
it
counted
in
capital
units
from
to
of
edward
army
and
counting
all
fighting
men
against
all
fighting
men
perhaps
much
the
same
proportion
there
was
sharp
fighting
but
it
was
defeated
principally
through
the
action
of
the
archers
in
command
was
a
very
considerable
body
of
genoese
as
we
shall
see
when
we
come
to
the
battle
of
crécy
itself
this
arm
was
gravely
inferior
in
rapidity
of
fire
and
possibly
in
range
to
the
english
the
latter
weapon
could
deliver
three
to
the
one
and
to
this
coupled
with
the
discipline
of
the
english
column
the
success
must
be
ascribed
grave
as
was
the
balance
of
numbers
against
the
french
side
equal
armament
and
equal
discipline
should
have
enabled
it
to
prevail
the
holding
of
a
de
with
a
smaller
number
properly
deployed
should
always
be
possible
against
a
larger
column
compelled
to
debouch
from
a
narrow
line
especially
a
line
of
such
difficulty
as
a
ford
across
a
broad
stream
the
action
was
a
picturesque
one
and
the
sight
presented
to
a
spectator
watching
it
from
the
heights
behind
godemard
command
must
have
been
a
picture
vivid
and
well
framed
one
hundred
mounted
and
armoured
knights
carefully
chosen
led
the
way
across
the
ford
they
were
met
actually
in
the
water
itself
by
mounted
men
advancing
on
to
the
causeway
from
godemard
side
and
the
twin
banners
of
edward
two
marshals
and
the
cries
of
god
and
st
george
with
which
the
english
vanguard
met
the
enemy
rose
for
a
few
moments
from
a
confused
mêlée
of
men
and
horses
struggling
in
the
stream
but
the
issue
was
decided
by
the
comparative
strength
of
missile
weapons
and
not
by
the
sword
the
genoese
behind
the
french
knights
and
upon
either
side
of
their
rear
shot
into
the
english
mounted
ranks
with
some
success
when
the
archers
of
edward
who
were
just
behind
the
knights
and
seem
to
have
deployed
somewhat
over
the
marshy
land
on
either
side
of
the
ford
returned
their
fire
with
that
superiority
of
the
which
helped
to
decide
this
campaign
it
was
the
regular
fire
of
the
archers
the
weight
and
the
rapidity
of
it
which
finally
threw
the
supporting
infantry
of
the
french
command
into
confusion
and
permitted
the
mounted
head
of
the
english
column
to
force
its
way
over
the
landward
end
of
the
ford
and
through
the
now
isolated
body
of
french
knights
once
the
bank
was
gained
the
english
head
of
the
column
in
its
turn
held
the
de
and
the
passage
of
the
whole
force
was
only
a
question
of
time
but
time
was
a
factor
of
vast
importance
at
this
juncture
how
important
what
immediately
followed
will
show
a
force
of
anything
between
and
thousand
men
combatant
and
with
its
wagons
and
sumpter
horses
the
considerable
booty
of
its
raid
its
tents
its
reserve
of
armour
and
of
weapons
we
can
not
reckon
even
upon
a
front
of
twelve
deep
at
less
than
a
couple
of
miles
in
length
even
under
the
best
and
strictest
conditions
of
marshalling
indeed
that
estimate
is
far
too
low
and
mechanical
it
is
more
likely
that
by
the
time
the
head
of
the
column
was
pouring
from
the
causeway
on
to
the
right
bank
of
the
estuary
and
there
deploying
a
good
third
of
the
armed
men
were
still
waiting
upon
the
further
shore
to
file
over
the
narrow
passage
at
any
rate
before
the
great
bulk
of
the
train
could
have
got
upon
the
ford
the
first
horse
of
the
king
of
france
scouts
and
vanguard
appeared
upon
the
of
the
heights
above
saigneville
and
immediately
a
considerable
force
of
the
enemy
were
upon
the
english
wagons
with
their
insufficient
rearguard
the
king
of
france
himself
following
upon
edward
track
mile
by
mile
had
reached
mons
had
learnt
that
edward
had
doubled
back
from
boismont
and
had
detached
a
body
to
cut
across
country
to
the
ford
on
the
chance
of
preventing
edward
from
crossing
he
had
not
been
quick
enough
to
achieve
this
but
the
french
appeared
in
time
as
i
have
said
to
catch
the
wheeled
vehicles
behind
the
english
army
before
they
had
got
into
line
upon
the
causeway
edward
with
that
good
military
head
which
always
seized
immediate
things
upon
a
field
had
stayed
somewhat
to
the
rear
of
the
main
body
to
watch
for
such
an
accident
he
was
not
able
to
save
the
bulk
of
his
train
but
he
saved
his
army
much
of
the
booty
and
of
the
provision
fell
to
the
french
this
mishap
which
shows
how
close
a
chance
permitted
the
safety
of
edward
fighting
force
had
no
little
effect
upon
the
succeeding
two
days
for
it
left
the
english
army
in
part
without
food
i
say
in
part
because
for
some
of
them
the
defect
was
remedied
as
we
shall
see
by
the
capture
of
crotoy
so
the
english
army
passed
with
the
loss
of
some
of
its
train
but
with
very
little
loss
of
men
pursuit
was
impossible
the
tide
now
rising
forbade
even
the
thought
of
it
and
somewhere
about
noon
the
entire
host
was
marshalled
upon
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
and
was
safe
the
whole
story
forms
one
of
the
most
striking
details
in
the
history
of
medieval
warfare
what
followed
the
discomfiture
of
godemard
command
and
edward
passage
with
his
forces
intact
is
not
easy
to
gather
in
the
authorities
themselves
though
it
is
easy
enough
to
reconstruct
with
the
aid
of
the
kitchen
accounts
and
by
the
help
of
the
analogy
of
edward
action
throughout
the
campaign
the
king
tent
his
domesticity
and
what
we
may
by
an
anachronism
call
his
staff
proceeded
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
of
crécy
which
lies
upon
the
inland
heights
of
the
ford
a
distance
of
five
miles
but
it
did
not
proceed
there
directly
in
company
with
the
whole
army
it
first
turned
down
the
bank
of
the
estuary
to
the
capture
of
the
castle
and
town
of
noyelles
rather
more
than
two
miles
away
this
castle
it
took
and
it
is
characteristic
of
these
wars
that
the
mistress
of
it
was
english
in
sympathy
and
what
is
more
had
married
her
daughter
to
the
nephew
of
one
of
edward
principal
generals
from
noyelles
on
the
same
day
thursday
edward
and
the
staff
turned
back
towards
the
forest
there
was
a
skirmish
at
sailly
bray
with
godemard
command
which
though
defeated
was
not
yet
broken
and
which
had
hung
upon
the
flanks
of
the
english
army
but
the
belated
struggle
was
of
little
importance
and
edward
camped
that
night
upon
the
edge
of
the
forest
in
the
neighbourhood
of
forêt
to
the
west
of
the
little
railway
line
and
station
which
mark
those
fields
meanwhile
during
the
remaining
hours
of
that
thursday
the
customary
raiding
and
pillaging
parties
which
had
been
characteristic
of
all
this
great
raid
were
being
sent
out
the
chief
one
under
hugh
the
dispenser
took
crotoy
and
thus
provisioned
his
own
force
and
perhaps
some
of
the
neighbouring
detachments
but
the
bulk
of
edward
army
went
famished
that
day
and
for
that
matter
were
insufficiently
provided
during
the
ensuing
friday
as
well
the
host
camped
upon
that
thursday
night
somewhat
widely
spread
around
its
king
with
foraging
parties
still
distant
and
appointed
to
return
upon
the
morrow
upon
that
morrow
the
friday
the
advance
was
continued
it
was
organised
in
a
fashion
whose
exactitude
and
forethought
are
worthy
of
note
considering
the
haphazard
conditions
of
most
medieval
fighting
and
of
edward
own
previous
conduct
of
the
earlier
part
of
this
campaign
these
were
the
conditions
before
him
he
must
get
as
best
he
might
to
the
straits
of
dover
that
is
up
northward
and
and
he
may
already
have
had
a
design
upon
calais
the
force
which
was
pursuing
him
had
been
checked
by
the
tide
of
the
somme
it
was
too
large
to
use
blanchetaque
with
any
rapidity
he
knew
that
it
must
double
back
to
abbeville
in
order
to
cross
the
river
before
it
could
turn
northward
again
and
come
up
with
him
from
where
it
lay
or
rather
where
its
commander
and
staff
had
lain
between
mons
and
saigneville
that
morning
and
noon
back
to
abbeville
was
a
matter
of
seven
or
eight
miles
a
distance
nearly
as
great
separated
him
from
abbeville
upon
his
side
he
had
gained
a
full
day
even
if
the
french
army
had
been
collected
highly
disciplined
and
in
column
instead
of
that
it
was
scattered
over
twenty
miles
of
country
many
of
its
contingents
were
still
following
up
and
it
was
under
very
various
and
loose
commands
even
should
a
large
body
of
french
appear
upon
the
next
day
friday
edward
had
the
forest
at
hand
with
which
to
cover
his
troops
long
before
contact
could
be
established
but
good
scouting
informed
edward
that
there
was
no
chance
of
such
contact
at
least
before
saturday
the
whole
of
the
next
day
friday
would
be
at
his
disposal
to
bring
his
troops
where
he
would
and
he
proposed
to
get
them
on
the
far
side
of
the
forest
that
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
crécy
town
during
the
interval
whether
he
had
already
decided
on
that
thursday
to
make
a
stand
we
can
not
tell
but
it
is
not
probable
because
he
had
as
yet
no
knowledge
of
the
positions
beyond
the
forest
and
of
the
chance
the
ground
would
afford
him
of
meeting
an
attack
one
thing
he
already
knew
which
was
that
his
retreat
was
secure
the
pace
of
the
french
pursuit
might
compel
him
to
a
decision
on
saturday
at
earliest
but
short
of
complete
disaster
he
had
a
road
open
behind
him
across
the
authie
by
the
passage
of
ponches
and
along
the
great
roman
way
which
led
from
picardy
to
the
straits
of
dover
what
he
did
was
this
he
sent
the
bulk
of
the
army
round
by
the
main
road
whose
terminals
are
abbeville
and
hesdin
and
which
skirts
the
forest
his
own
household
he
accompanied
through
the
wood
presumably
with
the
object
of
keeping
in
touch
with
the
foraging
parties
who
would
during
that
friday
be
coming
up
along
the
southern
edge
of
the
woods
to
follow
the
main
force
along
the
high
road
a
further
advantage
of
so
moving
through
the
wood
himself
was
that
he
could
thus
lie
upon
the
flank
of
his
force
and
let
it
march
round
him
until
it
got
in
front
of
him
in
the
open
country
by
crécy
then
he
could
join
it
coming
up
in
its
rear
that
is
upon
the
side
from
which
attack
was
expected
gather
his
information
study
the
positions
learn
the
approach
of
the
french
advance
and
in
general
organise
the
coming
action
if
an
action
should
prove
necessary
edward
camped
therefore
in
the
forest
upon
that
friday
night
and
upon
the
further
side
of
it
just
above
crécy
town
while
the
whole
of
his
main
body
was
marching
up
to
the
right
or
east
of
him
by
the
high
road
that
skirts
the
woods
that
main
force
joined
by
the
foraging
parties
which
had
gone
further
westward
on
the
day
before
easily
covered
the
few
miles
and
camped
on
the
evening
of
the
friday
upon
the
ridge
which
runs
in
a
level
line
eastward
and
northward
from
just
above
the
town
of
crécy
to
the
village
of
wadicourt
for
somewhat
over
a
mile
leaving
his
tents
and
domestics
upon
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
spent
the
last
hours
of
that
day
establishing
his
forces
along
the
ridge
for
the
night
for
it
was
there
that
he
had
now
determined
to
await
the
french
army
and
to
bring
it
to
action
the
advantage
of
that
position
which
upon
emerging
from
the
forest
edward
had
immediately
seized
will
be
dealt
with
in
the
ensuing
section
meanwhile
we
must
return
to
inquire
what
was
happening
to
the
french
pursuit
we
must
not
consider
the
french
army
as
one
united
body
had
it
been
that
it
would
not
have
been
defeated
and
what
is
more
the
particular
place
of
crécy
in
military
history
and
its
lesson
of
the
contrast
between
the
older
feudal
and
the
newer
regular
levies
would
never
have
been
taken
for
crécy
as
we
shall
see
was
largely
a
victory
of
things
then
new
over
things
then
old
no
records
give
us
precisely
the
positions
number
or
routes
of
the
king
of
france
and
his
allies
but
we
know
the
following
points
from
which
we
can
construct
a
general
picture
first
the
commands
were
various
and
disunited
that
personal
system
which
had
arisen
five
hundred
years
before
and
more
when
the
old
roman
tradition
of
the
frankish
monarchy
gradually
transformed
itself
into
a
series
of
summonses
to
lords
who
should
bring
their
vassals
was
still
the
method
by
which
a
french
host
was
tardily
and
irregularly
summoned
for
general
and
lengthy
expeditions
it
was
sufficient
for
the
prosecution
of
the
innumerable
local
conflicts
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
actually
necessary
upon
occasion
at
long
distances
from
home
and
after
long
companionship
in
the
field
if
there
were
also
present
a
very
leading
character
among
the
feudal
superiors
and
especially
if
that
character
were
clothed
with
titular
rank
it
could
achieve
something
like
unity
of
command
but
philip
army
the
last
contingents
of
which
were
still
in
act
of
joining
him
enjoyed
no
such
advantages
at
least
five
separate
great
bodies
four
of
which
were
largely
subdivided
were
loosely
aggregated
over
miles
of
country
gathering
as
they
went
chance
reinforcements
and
losing
by
chance
defections
secondly
a
certain
proportion
of
regular
paid
men
including
the
foreign
mercenaries
accompanied
the
king
of
france
these
were
in
part
with
the
king
himself
in
part
detached
to
watch
the
passages
of
the
river
thirdly
the
king
with
a
considerable
personal
force
and
with
some
of
his
mercenaries
as
well
was
up
in
the
neighbourhood
of
saigneville
upon
the
noon
and
early
afternoon
of
the
thursday
he
retraced
his
steps
towards
abbeville
and
recrossed
the
river
there
himself
either
upon
the
thursday
evening
or
more
probably
upon
the
friday
fourthly
round
about
abbeville
the
bulk
of
the
incongruous
force
was
gathered
when
the
king
reached
it
and
very
considerable
bodies
lay
in
the
suburbs
to
the
north
of
the
town
finally
we
know
that
on
the
saturday
morning
the
king
heard
mass
and
took
communion
at
the
church
of
st
stephen
now
demolished
from
all
this
we
can
construct
a
fairly
accurate
view
of
the
french
advance
especially
when
we
consider
where
the
french
forces
lay
when
they
reached
the
field
from
abbeville
to
the
field
of
crécy
is
as
the
crow
flies
ten
miles
a
great
main
road
along
the
further
part
of
which
the
english
had
marched
on
the
friday
led
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
field
and
past
it
the
main
road
which
goes
from
abbeville
to
hesdin
by
this
road
breaking
up
probably
rather
late
upon
the
saturday
morning
the
largest
of
the
loosely
gathered
french
contingents
marched
far
to
the
right
of
them
over
the
countryside
would
be
advancing
the
other
feudal
levies
under
the
king
of
bohemia
and
john
of
luxembourg
the
exiled
count
of
flanders
the
of
majorca
and
other
friends
connections
and
vassals
whom
philip
had
summoned
with
their
arrays
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
certain
bodies
on
the
extreme
right
went
up
by
the
roman
road
which
misses
abbeville
coming
from
the
south
and
makes
for
ponches
bounding
the
battlefield
of
crécy
on
its
extreme
eastern
side
following
this
chaotic
advance
of
the
dispersed
host
gathered
in
a
jumble
the
wholly
untrained
peasant
levies
which
had
been
swept
up
from
the
villages
on
the
advance
proceeded
in
disorder
and
it
was
thus
without
regular
formation
save
among
the
genoese
mercenaries
some
in
number
at
the
outset
of
the
campaign
though
we
do
not
know
of
what
strength
on
the
field
itself
that
the
first
lines
of
mounted
men
caught
sight
from
the
heights
of
noyelles
and
domvast
of
the
english
line
on
the
ridge
of
crécy
three
miles
away
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
before
that
sight
was
seen
the
wind
was
from
the
sea
and
gathering
clouds
promising
a
storm
were
coming
up
before
it
and
hiding
the
sun
before
these
advance
lines
of
the
french
army
and
between
it
and
command
the
ground
fell
gradually
away
in
low
very
gentle
slopes
of
open
field
towards
the
shallow
depression
above
which
a
somewhat
steeper
and
shorter
bank
defended
the
line
a
mile
and
a
half
long
upon
which
edward
had
stretched
his
men
there
was
an
attempt
at
some
sort
of
deployment
and
the
first
of
three
main
commands
or
battles
were
more
or
less
formed
under
alençon
the
french
king
brother
immediately
before
it
were
deployed
the
trained
mercenaries
including
the
italian
under
their
own
leaders
dorio
and
grimaldi
behind
was
a
confused
mass
of
arriving
horse
and
foot
the
king
himself
to
the
rear
of
it
and
much
of
it
german
and
flemish
separate
commands
we
do
not
know
their
composition
at
all
still
further
to
the
rear
and
stretched
out
for
miles
to
the
south
straggling
up
from
abbeville
came
that
late
afternoon
the
rest
of
the
host
at
random
before
the
action
was
begun
the
whole
sky
was
darkened
by
the
approaching
storm
and
violent
pelting
rain
fell
upon
either
host
the
clouds
passed
the
sky
cleared
again
but
it
was
nearly
five
before
the
first
attack
was
ordered
in
order
to
explain
what
followed
we
must
next
grasp
the
nature
of
the
terrain
and
the
value
of
the
defensive
position
upon
which
edward
had
determined
to
stand
illustration
iv
the
terrain
of
crécy
the
action
decided
upon
the
field
of
crécy
developed
wholly
within
the
central
space
shown
in
the
frontispiece
of
this
volume
the
general
frame
within
which
the
battle
took
place
must
be
regarded
as
a
parallelogram
corresponding
to
the
exterior
limits
of
that
map
not
quite
four
miles
in
length
from
east
to
west
and
some
miles
in
breadth
from
north
to
south
having
the
town
of
crécy
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
medial
line
and
a
good
deal
on
the
left
or
western
side
of
the
area
but
the
emplacement
of
the
troops
and
the
actual
fighting
including
the
partial
pursuit
by
the
victors
is
wholly
contained
within
a
smaller
area
which
lies
aslant
with
its
major
axis
pointing
its
minor
axis
pointing
and
surrounding
the
dip
called
the
val
aux
clercs
the
aspect
of
this
countryside
is
that
of
so
many
in
the
of
france
the
passage
of
six
and
a
half
centuries
has
not
greatly
modified
it
the
limits
of
the
royal
forest
of
crécy
are
what
they
have
been
perhaps
from
roman
certainly
from
early
medieval
times
the
characteristic
hedgeless
rolling
ploughed
land
which
is
the
normal
landscape
of
all
french
provinces
and
of
many
others
has
been
disturbed
by
no
growth
of
modern
industrialism
and
its
contours
remain
unmodified
by
any
considerable
excavations
of
the
soil
the
villages
attaching
to
the
battlefield
estrées
wadicourt
fontaine
are
in
extent
and
even
in
appearance
much
what
they
were
when
the
armies
of
the
fourteenth
century
occupied
them
and
the
little
of
crécy
has
not
appreciably
extended
its
limits
even
minor
features
such
as
the
small
groups
of
woodland
and
the
spinnies
seem
judged
by
our
remaining
descriptions
of
the
battle
to
be
much
the
same
as
they
were
then
the
terrain
of
crécy
offers
therefore
an
excellent
opportunity
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
medieval
scene
and
i
will
attempt
to
bring
it
before
the
eyes
of
my
readers
ponthieu

a
district
of
low
open
and
slightly
undulating
fertile
lands
whose
highest
ridges
touch
such
contours
as
feet
above
the
sea
and
the
depressions
in
which
very
broad
and
easy
do
not
commonly
fall
more
than
a
feet
or
so
below
the
higher
rolls
of
land
in
the
particular
case
of
the
field
of
crécy
we
shall
have
to
deal
with
figures
even
less
marked
the
crests
from
which
the
opposing
armies
viewed
each
other
before
the
action
average
full
feet
above
the
sea
the
broad
shallow
depression
between
its
confronting
ridges
descends
to
little
more
than
sixty
feet
below
them
all
this
wide
expanse
of
fertile
land
affording
from
one
lift
of
its
undulations
and
another
great
even
views
for
miles
and
miles
is
cut
by
streams
which
run
parallel
to
each
other
in
trenches
five
to
seven
miles
apart
and
make
their
way
by
curiously
straight
courses
to
the
neighbouring
sea
these
are
the
conche
the
authie
the
crossing
of
whose
marshes
by
the
great
roman
road
formed
those
which
as
we
have
seen
give
the
district
its
name
of
ponthieu
and
the
maye
this
last
little
river
alone
concerns
us
we
deal
in
the
matter
of
the
battle
of
crécy
only
with
the
first
rising
waters
of
the
maye
its
source
springs
just
below
the
village
which
derives
from
that
its
name
of
fontaine
and
the
church
of
crécy
stands
not
two
miles
down
the
young
stream
these
two
miles
of
its
course
and
a
slight
depression
tributary
to
this
its
upper
basin
mould
the
battlefield
for
this
shallow
depression
called
the
val
aux
clercs
among
the
least
of
the
many
long
waves
and
troughs
of
land
upon
which
ponthieu
is
modelled
was
the
centre
of
the
engagement
and
though
too
short
and
shallow
to
develop
the
smaller
stream
such
water
as
it
collects
is
tributary
to
the
maye
this
depression
runs
up
from
the
level
exactly
gradually
rising
until
it
fades
not
quite
two
miles
above
the
river
into
the
upper
levels
of
the
plateau
on
either
side
of
this
val
aux
clercs
lift
the
soft
and
inconspicuous
slopes
that
bound
it
the
one
that
bounds
it
on
the
north
and
west
and
from
which
a
man
faces
the
and
the
direction
of
amiens
was
the
eminence
occupied
by
the
army
of
edward
iii
at
its
southern
end
where
it
overlooks
the
narrow
rivulet
of
the
maye
it
descends
abruptly
to
the
meadow
level
of
the
stream
the
fall
at
this
terminal
of
the
bank
is
one
of
feet
its
slope
varies
from
one
in
ten
to
one
in
twelve
and
on
that
slope
and
on
the
meadow
level
below
it
the
little
town
of
crécy
stands
there
is
the
mouth
of
the
val
aux
clercs
and
the
further
one
walks
along
the
road
which
marks
the
position
of
the
english
line
and
the
nearer
one
approaches
wadicourt
the
shallower
and
less
conspicuous
and
flatter
does
the
val
aux
clercs
appear
upon
one
right
as
its
depression
rises
towards
the
general
level
of
the
plateau
at
last
in
the
neighbourhood
of
wadicourt
itself
the
first
houses
of
which
stand
yards
from
the
last
houses
of
crécy
the
depression
has
almost
disappeared
the
bank
or
fall
of
land
from
this
crest
of
the
english
position
down
to
the
lowest
point
of
the
trough
steeper
towards
its
southern
or
crécy
easier
towards
its
northern
or
wadicourt
end
is
upon
the
average
a
slope
of
one
in
thirty
just
steep
enough
to
produce
its
effect
upon
a
charging
crowd
especially
over
soil
drenched
by
rain
and
falling
just
sufficiently
to
give
their
maximum
value
to
the
of
the
which
was
the
chief
arm
of
edward
command
the
opposing
slope
that
which
lies
to
the
south
and
east
of
the
vale
and
from
which
the
traveller
faces
the
blowing
from
a
shore
not
fifteen
miles
away
is
much
easier
and
more
gentle
even
than
its
counterpart
the
ridge
of
it
stands
above
the
lowest
point
of
the
val
aux
clercs
no
higher
than
the
corresponding
and
opposite
ridge
which
the
english
king
occupied
with
his
army
but
the
fall
covers
double
the
distance
it
is
not
yards
but
more
like
a
mile
and
the
average
of
the
decline
is
one
in
fifty
at
the
most
moreover
this
opposing
ridge
is
neither
as
cleanly
marked
as
the
line
nor
parallel
to
it
it
is
impossible
to
fix
upon
it
with
any
definition
a
true
crest
the
slope
undulates
very
gradually
into
the
general
level
of
the
plateau
and
is
so
formed
that
the
val
aux
clercs
is
much
wider
at
the
mouth
on
the
maye
than
towards
its
upper
end
the
depression
therefore
which
was
the
theatre
of
the
action
is
in
the
main
and
its
mouth
is
a
full
mile
in
breadth
while
its
last
faint
upper
portion
is
not
half
that
width
such
in
detail
is
the
field
of
crécy
i
have
attempted
in
the
cut
opposite
to
express
graphically
its
main
features
as
they
would
appear
upon
a
model
carved
in
wood
and
plotted
to
show
the
actual
relief
of
the
soil
i
will
conclude
by
pointing
out
to
the
english
reader
a
curious
parallel
the
field
of
crécy
has
many
analogies
to
the
field
of
waterloo
in
both
cases
two
opposing
ridges
roughly
determine
the
general
plan
in
both
a
depression
double
and
complex
in
the
modern
single
in
the
medieval
instance
lies
between
the
two
lines
that
of
crécy
as
was
suitable
for
a
day
in
which
no
missiles
of
long
range
were
available
is
somewhat
more
marked
and
affords
somewhat
more
of
an
obstacle
to
the
offensive
than
that
of
waterloo
in
both
the
french
formed
the
attacking
force
and
in
both
the
defensive
position
was
chosen
with
singular
mastery
indeed
an
eye
for
a
defensive
position
marks
edward
plan
most
strongly
and
is
quite
apart
from
the
successful
result
of
his
action
his
best
title
to
repute
in
military
history
at
the
close
of
this
section
the
plainest
duty
of
an
historian
as
well
as
the
satisfaction
of
common
humour
compels
me
to
allude
to
a
characteristic
production
of
the
university
of
oxford
there
has
proceeded
from
this
university
a
perhaps
the
most
universally
used
in
the
public
schools
of
this
country
known
as
history
of
i
was
myself
brought
up
on
it
it
is
taken
i
suppose
like
much
other
oxford
matter
as
something
and
official
this
has
upon
page
of
its
first
volume
a
map
of
the
battle
of
crécy
it
is
fair
to
say
that
such
a
production
could
not
have
proceeded
i
do
not
say
from
any
university
upon
the
continent
of
europe
but
from
the
humblest
schoolmaster
in
a
french
swiss
or
german
village
the
features
marked
upon
it
are
wholly
and
unreservedly
imaginary
there
is
not
even
the
pretence
of
a
remote
similarity
between
this
grotesque
thing
and
the
terrain
of
the
famous
battle
it
is
a
pure
invention
it
is
almost
impossible
to
express
in
words
the
difference
between
this
product
of
fancy
and
even
the
most
inaccurate
map
sketched
from
memory
or
the
merest
jottings
set
down
by
someone
who
had
no
more
to
guide
him
than
some
vague
recollection
of
an
account
of
the
battle
there
is
nothing
in
it
bearing
the
remotest
resemblance
to
any
hill
river
road
wood
village
or
point
of
the
compass
concerned
with
the
field
of
crécy
and
to
this
astonishing
abortion
is
modestly
added
in
the
bottom
corner
from
sprüner
i
have
not
by
me
as
i
write
sprüner
collection
of
historical
maps
which
were
given
us
at
the
university
but
if
that
eminent
authority
was
the
model
for
such
a
masterpiece
it
is
a
sufficient
commentary
upon
the
rest
of
his
work
i
before
me
as
i
write
the
flabbergasting
plan
in
which
i
have
treasured
ever
since
my
boyhood
and
i
trust
that
this
note
may
be
read
by
many
who
still
believe
that
the
function
of
our
universities
is
to
train
the
governing
class
of
the
nation
not
so
much
in
learning
as
in
character
contrast
the
excellent
and
accurate
little
map
in
the
manual
which
mr
barnard
published
twelve
years
ago
from
the
clarendon
press
the
whole
of
this
book
is
to
be
most
highly
recommended
i
believe
that
this
map
the
only
doubtful
features
of
which
are
the
angular
formation
of
the
english
archers
and
the
concentration
of
the
french
rear
upon
the
roman
road
is
from
the
pencil
of
mr
oman
v
the
action
king
edward
upon
that
saturday
morning
before
he
had
yet
caught
sight
of
the
french
of
whose
advance
his
scouts
informed
him
rode
on
a
little
horse
slowly
up
and
down
the
ranks
encouraging
his
army
as
it
sat
and
lay
at
rest
with
shield
and
helm
and
bow
upon
the
grass
before
each
man
along
the
crest
of
the
slight
hill
in
his
hand
the
king
bore
a
white
wand
and
no
weapon
and
this
visitation
of
his
lasted
until
nearly
ten
his
last
orders
were
that
all
his
men
should
eat
and
drink
heartily
and
he
himself
conveyed
that
order
to
his
own
division
which
lay
behind
the
main
line
he
had
organised
the
defence
upon
a
very
simple
pattern
that
battalion
which
was
called
the
first
battalion
consisted
of
that
is
fully
armoured
knights
upon
horseback
with
archers
and
welshmen
they
occupied
that
turn
or
shoulder
of
the
slope
which
runs
round
from
the
town
of
crécy
itself
into
the
beginning
of
the
val
aux
clercs
and
were
under
the
nominal
command
of
the
lad
the
prince
of
wales
but
at
his
side
the
real
orderers
of
that
force
were
warwick
and
oxford
such
was
the
english
right
next
in
the
centre
and
back
from
the
first
battalion
was
the
line
of
english
archers
it
was
very
carefully
organised
with
the
object
of
a
purely
defensive
action
small
pits
were
dug
before
each
man
station
and
this
infantry
was
arranged
in
harrow
formation
much
as
trees
are
planted
in
an
orchard
in
so
that
any
five
of
them
formed
a
figure
somewhat
like
the
five
in
a
pack
of
cards
it
is
evident
that
this
formation
if
the
men
were
sufficiently
dispersed
as
they
were
gave
the
freest
play
to
their
missiles
all
of
which
could
be
shot
through
the
intervals
and
when
we
remember
the
rate
of
fire
three
to
one
of
the
we
shall
understand
how
formidable
was
this
infantry
and
how
well
able
it
was
to
break
any
cavalry
charge
prepared
by
nothing
more
than
the
shots
of
the
genoese
all
the
tradition
and
sentiment
of
medieval
warfare
gave
to
the
mounted
knight
the
glory
of
battle
but
as
i
shall
have
occasion
to
remark
in
the
sequel
the
great
feature
of
crécy
was
the
presence
of
an
ordered
highly
trained
infantry
expected
to
await
and
capable
of
awaiting
a
rush
of
horse
until
that
cavalry
should
receive
at
say
fifty
to
eighty
yards
the
whole
weight
of
a
furious
and
sustained
discharge
of
missiles
beyond
the
archers
some
in
number
at
this
point
were
mounted
knights
who
together
with
the
archers
at
the
centre
were
under
the
command
of
northampton
there
may
have
been
a
certain
number
of
archers
to
the
left
again
of
these
knights
but
at
any
rate
northampton
command
covered
the
rest
of
the
ridge
and
reposed
upon
wadicourt
here
lest
it
should
be
turned
the
left
flank
of
the
english
line
was
protected
by
a
park
of
wagons
drawn
up
close
together
vehicles
taken
from
such
of
the
train
as
had
been
saved
from
the
french
attack
upon
the
rearguard
at
the
ford
two
days
before
the
remainder
of
the
wagons
provisions
and
impedimenta
were
drawn
up
in
the
rear
near
the
wood
and
in
front
of
them
and
between
them
and
the
defensive
line
upon
the
ridge
was
a
strong
reserve
of
over
men
under
edward
himself
taking
no
account
of
we
must
reckon
archers
armoured
men
and
together
at
perhaps
men
and
certainly
not
more
than
but
we
must
remember
as
i
said
upon
a
former
page
that
every
archer
was
served
by
aides
that
a
needed
a
squire
and
that
drivers
and
domestics
of
various
kinds
and
many
recruits
from
normandy
swelled
the
host
the
large
force
against
which
this
defensive
was
drawn
up
has
been
variously
estimated
its
dispersion
over
the
countryside
the
lack
of
any
cohesive
command
the
absence
of
all
precise
figures
the
considerable
bodies
of
wholly
untrained
country
folk
who
were
straggling
up
behind
the
army
make
an
estimate
of
the
actual
forces
engaged
on
the
french
side
extremely
difficult
we
do
not
know
how
many
germans
luxemburgians
and
others
had
been
brought
up
with
the
feudal
levy
the
rough
guess
of
contemporaries
at
the
whole
numbers
present
and
arriving
during
this
confused
marshalling
of
philip
host
calls
it
a
recent
and
very
careful
english
authority
has
estimated
the
enemy
actually
in
line
at
if
we
say
that
edward
met
forces
more
than
double
his
own
but
not
three
times
his
own
we
are
as
near
the
truth
as
we
can
hope
to
get
but
the
right
way
to
estimate
the
disproportion
between
the
offensive
and
the
defensive
upon
this
famous
day
is
to
contrast
the
fully
armoured
mounted
men
of
either
side
and
further
to
contrast
the
trained
infantry
armed
with
missile
weapons
the
infantry
trained
or
untrained
armed
only
with
spear
dagger
or
sword
upon
such
an
analysis
we
get
some
such
result
as
follows
some
fully
armoured
mounted
men
in
edward
command
of
whom
only
or
less
were
out
of
the
reserve
and
in
the
line
some
archers
actually
in
the
defensive
line
with
a
much
smaller
number
unknown
in
the
reserve
add
spearmen
for
the
most
part
welsh
against
these
on
the
offensive
you
may
set
at
the
very
least
quite
four
times
their
number
of
fully
mounted
armoured
men
and
probably
six
times
their
number
or
even
more
as
against
the
english
archers
we
must
count
for
the
missile
arm
upon
the
french
side
somewhat
less
the
only
contemporary
authority
villani
who
gives
us
any
exact
figures
names
as
their
number
when
we
come
to
the
few
trained
infantry
of
the
english
forces
some
in
the
line
not
counting
the
reserve
and
contrast
them
with
the
rabble
of
untrained
and
scattered
french
countrymen
most
of
whom
were
still
coming
up
in
the
rear
and
did
not
take
part
in
the
action
save
to
suffer
slaughter
in
the
darkness
after
it
was
over
we
can
take
any
multiple
we
choose
they
may
have
been
five
six
or
eight
times
as
numerous
as
the
welshmen
with
whom
they
did
not
come
into
contact
at
all
it
will
be
seen
from
the
above
that
the
real
point
of
the
battle
and
that
which
decided
it
was
the
power
of
the
trained
missile
infantry
of
edward
to
await
a
charge
of
horse
in
no
matter
what
numerical
superiority
it
might
arrive
confident
that
they
could
always
check
it
before
it
reached
their
line
or
broke
it
and
inspired
by
that
confidence
because
the
only
missile
infantry
that
could
be
brought
against
them
to
prepare
such
a
cavalry
charge
was
armed
with
a
weapon
which
delivered
only
one
shot
to
their
three
that
was
the
deciding
element
of
the
battle
of
crécy
the
power
of
the
to
stop
horse
upon
any
front
equivalent
to
the
front
of
the
archers
and
the
confidence
of
the
bowman
in
that
power
the
action
opened
regularly
enough
with
the
advance
of
the
french
missile
infantry
the
genoese
mercenaries
at
the
hour
as
i
have
said
of
about
five
they
proceeded
down
the
slight
slope
into
the
val
aux
clercs
followed
at
a
foot
pace
by
a
strong
body
of
the
first
battalion
of
the
french
mounted
knights
under
alençon
advancing
thus
deployed
a
body
of
men
had
difficulty
in
keeping
its
line
a
thing
essential
to
the
simultaneous
effect
of
weapons
twice
they
were
halted
to
correct
their
alignment
and
though
perhaps
at
the
second
halt
they
were
at
the
lowest
point
of
the
valley
and
just
in
extreme
range
of
the
english
arrows
from
the
height
above
those
arrows
did
not
yet
come
the
english
had
been
ordered
to
reserve
their
fire
they
began
to
climb
the
opposing
slope
shouting
as
was
their
custom
and
after
a
third
halt
had
been
called
and
a
third
strict
alignment
made
so
near
to
the
english
front
as
to
be
certainly
in
range
for
their
the
order
to
shoot
was
given
with
the
first
flight
of
the
genoese
bolts
the
english
archers
took
each
man
his
step
forward
and
began
pouring
in
that
terrible
fire
sustained
accurate
and
rapid
to
which
they
were
so
admirably
trained
and
of
which
hitherto
save
in
the
fight
at
the
ford
no
example
had
been
given
in
continental
warfare
under
that
murderous
and
unceasing
rain
of
missiles
the
italian
mercenaries
whose
weapon
compelled
them
to
a
complicated
process
of
winding
and
ratcheting
and
laying
very
to
such
a
strain
fell
into
disorder
a
sufficient
proportion
of
them
broke
and
their
confusion
at
once
angered
and
churned
up
the
great
body
of
mounted
french
knights
which
awaited
impatiently
immediately
behind
their
line
they
were
ridden
down
in
the
eagerness
of
these
armoured
horsemen
to
retrieve
this
first
check
by
a
charge
and
alençon
men
spurred
hard
badly
hampered
by
that
obstacle
of
their
own
men
fallen
into
confusion
before
them
upon
the
english
right
and
the
prince
of
wales
battalion
some
of
them
got
home
especially
those
who
found
themselves
opposite
the
most
advanced
section
of
the
prince
of
wales
command
where
it
stood
thrust
forward
in
a
semicircle
upon
the
shoulder
and
last
slopes
of
the
hill
the
boy
himself
was
unhorsed
and
for
a
moment
the
pressure
was
severe
but
the
effect
of
the
arrow
fire
upon
all
the
rest
of
the
charging
line
told
heavily
it
never
got
home
indeed
it
must
have
been
apparent
to
edward
at
that
moment
that
for
all
the
fixed
tradition
of
chivalry
and
that
overwhelming
atmosphere
of
military
religion
which
in
every
age
according
to
its
traditions
confuses
the
soldier
had
he
kept
all
his
men
at
arms
in
reserve
and
put
archers
only
in
the
front
line
they
would
have
sufficed
to
win
his
battle
there
stands
upon
the
crécy
end
of
the
ridge
a
great
mound
to
this
day
it
is
the
foundation
of
an
old
stone
windmill
which
stood
there
for
centuries
and
which
has
been
shamefully
pulled
down
within
living
memory
from
that
mill
it
was
that
edward
watched
the
whole
action
proceeding
upon
the
slope
beneath
him
he
saw
the
head
of
the
french
charge
get
home
but
its
extended
line
wavering
checked
and
broken
up
on
the
val
aux
clercs
as
a
continuous
rain
of
arrows
poured
in
he
saw
all
the
front
ranks
of
horses
broken
the
animals
lashing
out
or
fallen
stampeding
rearward
mounted
or
riderless
the
heavily
armoured
knights
fallen
helpless
and
trampled
the
whole
thing
a
vast
confusion
it
was
near
six
the
westering
sun
was
within
an
hour
of
its
setting
and
shone
right
up
the
vale
coming
aslant
upon
the
burnished
armour
of
the
charge
had
this
kind
of
warfare
already
established
a
tradition
and
had
men
learned
by
experience
what
unshaken
infantry
could
do
against
horse
it
would
already
have
been
apparent
that
the
action
was
decided
but
there
was
no
such
experience
and
no
such
knowledge
over
the
long
slopes
of
open
field
which
fronted
the
english
ridge
line
after
line
of
knights
were
coming
forward
in
successive
waves
as
though
mere
weight
of
horses
and
men
could
win
home
in
spite
of
the
increasing
welter
of
flying
dead
and
maddened
mounts
and
of
fallen
men
and
iron
that
now
lined
all
the
front
with
a
belt
of
obstacle
more
formidable
than
earth
or
wall
and
of
those
such
few
as
could
struggle
through
to
within
range
might
hope
to
escape
the
deadly
and
now
converging
fire
which
struck
horse
after
horse
as
the
foot
of
the
ridge
was
reached
by
gaps
in
the
deadly
confusion
of
the
stampede
and
the
corpses
round
to
their
right
further
and
further
up
the
valley
upon
their
left
the
marshes
of
the
maye
forbade
a
turning
movement
the
french
charges
followed
and
spread
a
dozen
or
more
were
counted
and
each
as
it
came
met
the
missile
defence
and
was
broken
with
no
counter
missile
offensive
to
tame
that
fire
the
sun
was
setting
but
one
effort
was
made
which
should
have
been
made
far
earlier
in
the
short
crisis
it
was
an
effort
of
the
french
right
to
turn
the
english
left
by
wadicourt
due
we
may
imagine
to
no
regular
order
an
occasion
seized
upon
by
some
one
commander
who
saw
his
chance
a
charge
of
horse
was
led
right
up
to
that
end
of
the
english
line
the
barricade
of
wagons
prevented
its
getting
home
and
though
the
struggle
was
violent
the
obstacle
was
never
pierced
or
overcome
well
after
sunset
and
as
the
light
was
fading
the
king
of
france
himself
led
a
great
body
to
the
centre
and
seems
to
have
come
into
range
of
the
arrows
but
he
no
more
than
any
of
his
lieges
could
force
horse
against
steady
infantry
and
an
unremitting
fire
the
darkness
came
the
late
moon
rose
and
still
were
desultory
and
sporadic
charges
continued
haphazard
and
blindly
they
had
not
even
a
hazard
of
success
these
last
efforts
of
the
failing
battle
were
repelled
with
ease
but
even
up
to
midnight
the
final
pulses
of
the
fight
throbbed
with
lesser
and
lesser
pulsations
until
after
these
seven
hours
of
it
most
of
it
by
darkness
and
all
the
while
the
line
of
archers
standing
unbroken
and
all
the
while
supplied
with
their
unexhausted
ammunition
and
finding
strength
to
draw
and
to
discharge
the
thing
was
over
throughout
that
night
great
bodies
of
disordered
peasantry
the
militia
of
the
communes
fled
or
wandered
aimlessly
southward
over
the
bare
rolling
land
the
mounted
knights
had
ridden
away
from
a
field
where
all
was
utterly
lost
and
the
english
line
broke
up
to
move
forward
by
the
light
of
lanterns
over
the
face
of
the
countryside
to
despatch
or
to
capture
the
wounded
to
loot
to
search
for
the
faces
and
the
ensigns
of
the
greater
dead
but
in
that
darkness
the
magnitude
of
the
result
was
not
seen
the
english
army
seems
to
have
guessed
the
issue
mainly
by
the
dying
down
of
the
noise
and
the
ceasing
of
the
cries
of
men
rallying
to
their
lords
banners
this
was
the
end
of
the
battle
of
crécy
in
the
night
of
saturday
the
of
august
early
upon
the
sunday
morning
edward
forces
stood
to
arms
again
not
knowing
whether
even
yet
a
new
attack
might
not
be
made
mist
covered
all
the
landscape
through
which
fog
dimly
bodies
of
men
seemed
to
be
advancing
upon
them
from
the
south
they
were
reinforcements
of
come
up
in
ignorance
of
what
had
passed
the
day
before
or
at
any
rate
not
appreciating
how
decisive
the
day
had
been
five
hundred
knights
riding
out
easily
dispersed
them
further
bodies
straggling
up
in
similar
fashion
were
dealt
with
in
detail
and
all
that
morning
the
english
soldiers
going
at
large
over
the
fields
found
and
put
to
the
sword
lost
fragments
of
militia
came
as
they
tracked
the
flight
upon
dead
and
wounded
lords
and
cut
off
bewildered
remnants
making
they
knew
not
whither
over
the
land
the
total
french
losses
will
never
be
known
the
legend
of
disaster
calls
them
now
ten
now
twenty
thousand
of
the
mounted
and
armoured
men
of
rank
the
heralds
made
a
precise
account
and
returned
a
list
to
king
edward
of
fallen
and
dead
upon
the
front
of
the
battle
and
in
the
first
fields
of
the
retreat
to
these
due
sepulchre
was
given
the
mass
of
the
fallen
were
buried
in
common
trenches
marks
of
which
may
be
seen
to
this
day
and
it
is
said
that
fires
were
lit
to
rid
the
ground
of
the
dead
the
english
loss
was
wholly
insignificant
its
exact
amount
like
that
of
its
enemy
we
can
not
tell
because
a
list
of
but
two
knights
one
squire
and
forty
of
the
rest
not
counting
a
few
welsh
is
all
that
we
are
given
but
even
if
this
total
which
hardly
corresponds
to
the
fierce
mêlée
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
on
the
right
be
below
the
true
number
we
may
be
certain
that
that
number
was
very
small
indeed
the
line
was
never
pierced
the
english
fight
was
wholly
defensive
and
a
defensive
maintained
at
range
against
troops
which
disposed
after
the
first
rout
of
the
genoese
of
no
missiles
upon
their
side
upon
the
monday
morning
the
of
august
the
host
set
forth
upon
its
northern
march
quite
free
now
from
any
danger
of
pursuit
by
the
first
days
of
september
it
had
sat
down
before
calais
all
winter
and
all
the
succeeding
summer
the
blockade
continued
and
upon
the
of
august
nearly
a
year
after
crécy
the
town
was
taken
and
the
lasting
fruit
of
that
engagement
was
garnered
calais
remained
an
english
bastion
upon
the
continent
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
footnotes
we
have
this
upon
the
evidence
of
a
contemporary
villani
it
has
of
course
been
denied
by
our
modern
academic
authorities
but
without
evidence
the
theatrical
character
which
attaches
to
warfare
through
the
fourteenth
century
appears
at
this
very
outset
of
the
campaign
edward
knighted
the
black
prince
and
sundry
other
commanders
on
a
hill
overlooking
the
fleet
and
the
harbour
just
before
the
main
body
disembarked
the
black
prince
had
already
been
knighted
and
the
ceremony
was
mere
parade
he
did
go
to
rouen
or
near
it
as
the
map
in
mr
work
vol
presumes
rouen
was
he
found
too
strongly
held
there
is
no
time
for
the
big
loop
of
twenty
miles
which
mr
fortescue
introduces
and
no
evidence
for
it
this
is
not
de
vaudreuil
as
professor
thompson
suggests
but
st
cyr
just
beyond
where
the
bridge
is
this
point
has
also
proved
puzzling
thus
professor
thompson
calls
it
difficult
to
find
what
the
clerk
heard
and
set
down
was
the
term
this
as
professor
thompson
rightly
says
is
not
on
the
modern
maps
it
stood
just
above
near
the
modern
chateau
between
that
village
and
falaise
or
the
cliff
so
i
read
the
meaningless
rigmarole
of
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
but
i
may
be
wrong
professor
thompson
inclines
to
ecquevilly
a
mile
or
two
further
on
or
if
we
read
ecquevilly
the
main
army
halted
at
flins
the
low
tide
after
the
full
moon
occurred
on
that
of
august
at
about
half
in
the
open
sea
and
nearer
eight
in
the
estuary
or
even
later
for
we
must
allow
quite
seven
hours
ebb
to
five
hours
flow
in
that
funnel
in
its
old
unreclaimed
state
de
vol
iii
pp
etc
the
parish
boundaries
are
not
absolutely
straight
as
after
the
fashion
of
modern
french
communal
boundaries
they
follow
the
corners
of
the
oblong
strips
of
peasant
cultivation
but
the
aggregate
of
straight
lines
all
in
one
continuous
direction
marks
a
quite
unmistakable
trajectory
the
traveller
going
by
rail
from
paris
to
calais
or
boulogne
may
note
at
the
second
station
after
abbeville
a
wood
upon
the
heights
to
his
right
and
upon
his
left
the
reclaimed
valley
of
the
somme
the
next
station
he
passes
is
that
of
port
with
the
church
of
the
village
upon
his
right
as
he
leaves
it
and
the
embankment
which
he
sees
crossing
the
valley
floor
upon
his
left
a
mile
further
on
marks
the
passage
by
which
edward
iii
and
his
army
forced
the
then
broad
estuary
of
the
river
see
not
to
be
confounded
with
the
other
noyelles
upon
the
somme
ten
miles
away
it
was
at
this
moment
that
news
was
brought
to
king
edward
of
his
son
peril
and
that
he
replied
let
the
child
win
his
spurs
sending
the
messenger
back
empty
but
having
care
immediately
afterwards
to
despatch
reinforcement
