naughty
romping
girls
and

stands
with
his
nasty
hair
and
hands
see
his
nails
are
never

they
are
grimed
as
black
as
soot
and
the
sloven
i
declare
never

has
combed
his
hair
anything
to
me
is
sweeter
than
to
see
peter
cruel
frederick
here
is
cruel
frederick
see
a
horrid
wicked
boy
was
he
he
caught
the
flies
poor
little
things
and
then
tore
off
their
tiny
wings
he
killed
the
birds
and
broke
the
chairs
and
threw
the
kitten
down
the
stairs
and
oh
far
worse
than
all
beside
he
whipped
his
mary
till
she
cried
the
trough
was
full
and
faithful
tray
came
out
to
drink
one
sultry
day
he
wagged
his
tail
and
wet
his
lip
when
cruel
fred
snatched
up
a
whip
and
whipped
poor
tray
till
he
was
sore
and
kicked
and
whipped
him
more
and
more
at
this
good
tray
grew
very
red
and
growled
and
bit
him
till
he
bled
then
you
should
only
have
been
by
to
see
how
fred
did
scream
and
cry
so
frederick
had
to
go
to
bed
his
leg
was
very
sore
and
red
the
doctor
came
and
shook
his
head
and
made
a
very
great
and
gave
him
nasty
physic
too
but
good
dog
tray
is
happy
now
he
has
no
time
to
say
he
seats
himself
in
frederick
chair
and
laughs
to
see
the
nice
things
there
the
soup
he
swallows
sup
by
sup
and
eats
the
pies
and
puddings
up
the
dreadful
story
of
harriet
and
the
matches
it
almost
makes
me
cry
to
tell
what
foolish
harriet
befell
mamma
and
nurse
went
out
one
day
and
left
her
all
alone
at
play
now
on
the
table
close
at
hand
a
box
of
matches
chanced
to
stand
and
kind
mamma
and
nurse
had
told
her
that
if
she
touched
them
they
would
scold
her
but
harriet
said
oh
what
a
pity
for
when
they
burn
it
is
so
pretty
they
crackle
so
and
spit
and
flame
mamma
too
often
does
the
same
the
heard
this
and
they
began
to
hiss
and
stretch
their
claws
and
raise
their
paws
they
said
you
burn
to
death
if
you
do
so
but
harriet
would
not
take
advice
she
lit
a
match
it
was
so
nice
it
crackled
so
it
burned
so
clear
exactly
like
the
picture
here
she
jumped
for
joy
and
ran
about
and
was
too
pleased
to
put
it
out
the
saw
this
and
said
oh
naughty
naughty
miss
and
stretched
their
claws
and
raised
their
paws
is
very
very
wrong
you
know
you
will
be
burnt
if
you
do
so
and
see
oh
what
dreadful
thing
the
fire
has
caught
her
her
apron
burns
her
arms
her
hair
she
burns
all
over
everywhere
then
how
the
did
mew
what
else
poor
pussies
could
they
do
they
screamed
for
help
was
all
in
vain
so
then
they
said
we
scream
again
make
haste
make
haste
she
burn
to
death
we
told
her
so
so
she
was
burnt
with
all
her
clothes
and
arms
and
hands
and
eyes
and
nose
till
she
had
nothing
more
to
lose
except
her
little
scarlet
shoes
and
nothing
else
but
these
was
found
among
her
ashes
on
the
ground
and
when
the
good
cats
sat
beside
the
smoking
ashes
how
they
cried
what
will
mamma
and
nursey
do
their
tears
ran
down
their
cheeks
so
fast
they
made
a
little
pond
at
last
the
story
of
the
inky
boys
as
he
had
often
done
before
the
one
nice
fine
summer

to
see
the
shops
and
walk
about
and
as
he
found
it
hot
poor
fellow

took
with
him
his
green
umbrella
then
edward

noisy
wag
ran
out
and
laughed
and
waved
his
flag
and
william
came
in
jacket
trim
and
brought
his
wooden
hoop
with
him
and
arthur
too
snatched
up
his
toys
and
joined
the
other
naughty
boys
so
one
and
all
set
up
a
roar
and
laughed
and
hooted
more
and
more
and
kept
on
singing
only
think
oh

a
great
grew
he
called
out
in
an
angry
tone
boys
leave
the
alone
for
if
he
tries
with
all
his
might
he
can
not
change
from
black
to
white
but
ah
they
did
not
mind
a
bit
what
great
agrippa
said
of
it
but
went
on
laughing
as
before

hooting
at
the
then

and
heads
and

the
story
of
johnny
as
he
trudged
along
to
school
it
was
always
johnny
rule
to
be
looking
at
the
sky
and
the
clouds
that
floated
by
but
what
just
before
him
lay
in
his
way
johnny
never
thought
about
so
that
every
one
cried
out
look
at
little
johnny
there
little
johnny
running
just
in
johnny
way
came
a
little
dog
one
day
johnny
eyes
were
still
astray
up
on
high
in
the
sky
and
he
never
heard
them
cry
johnny
mind
the
dog
is
nigh
bump
dump
down
they
fell
with
such
a
thump
dog
and
johnny
in
a
lump
once
with
head
as
high
as
ever
johnny
walked
beside
the
river
johnny
watched
the
swallows
trying
which
was
cleverest
at
flying
oh
what
fun
johnny
watched
the
bright
round
sun
going
in
and
coming
out
this
was
all
he
thought
about
so
he
strode
on
only
think
to
the
river
very
brink
where
the
bank
was
high
and
steep
and
the
water
very
deep
and
the
fishes
in
a
row
stared
to
see
him
coming
so
one
step
more
oh
sad
to
tell
headlong
in
poor
johnny
fell
and
the
fishes
in
dismay
wagged
their
tails
and
swam
away
there
lay
johnny
on
his
face
with
his
nice
red
but
as
they
were
passing
by
two
strong
men
had
heard
him
cry
and
with
sticks
these
two
strong
men
hooked
poor
johnny
out
again
oh
you
should
have
seen
him
shiver
when
they
pulled
him
from
the
river
he
was
in
a
sorry
plight
dripping
wet
and
such
a
fright
wet
all
over
everywhere
clothes
and
arms
and
face
and
hair
johnny
never
will
forget
what
it
is
to
be
so
wet
and
the
fishes
one
two
three
are
come
back
again
you
see
up
they
came
the
moment
after
to
enjoy
the
fun
and
laughter
each
popped
out
his
little
head
and
to
tease
poor
johnny
said
silly
little
johnny
look
you
have
lost
your
the
story
of
flying
robert
when
the
rain
comes
tumbling
down
in
the
country
or
the
town
all
good
little
girls
and
boys
stay
at
home
and
mind
their
toys
robert
thought
no
when
it
pours
it
is
better
out
of
doors
rain
it
did
and
in
a
minute
bob
was
in
it
here
you
see
him
silly
fellow
underneath
his
red
umbrella
what
a
wind
oh
how
it
whistles
through
the
trees
and
flowers
and
thistles
it
has
caught
his
red
umbrella
now
look
at
him
silly
fellow
up
he
flies
to
the
skies
no
one
heard
his
screams
and
cries
through
the
clouds
the
rude
wind
bore
him
and
his
hat
flew
on
before
him
soon
they
got
to
such
a
height
they
were
nearly
out
of
sight
and
the
hat
went
up
so
high
that
it
nearly
touched
the
sky
no
one
ever
yet
could
tell
where
they
stopped
or
where
they
fell
only
this
one
thing
is
plain
bob
was
never
seen
again
