chapter
i
green
hill
june
a
new
doctor
has
arrived
in
green
hill
sarah
told
me
so
this
morning
when
she
brought
in
my
breakfast
she
set
the
tray
down
with
an
agitated
thump
and
after
her
strong
arms
had
raised
me
a
little
higher
among
the
pillows
she
stepped
back
folded
her
hands
beneath
her
apron
and
fixed
me
with
a
portentous
eye
now
do
try
and
relish
your
breakfast
miss
mavis
she
coaxed
there
a
good
girl
an
undercurrent
of
excitement
colored
her
tone
i
looked
upon
her
with
suspicion
but
i
know
my
sarah
like
fate
and
the
village
she
is
not
to
be
hurried
very
casually
i
reached
for
my
glass
of
milk
years
of
lying
comparatively
flat
on
a
useless
back
tend
to
the
development
of
patience
as
a
necessity
what
time
is
it
i
inquired
conversationally
past
nine
i
set
the
glass
aside
and
bit
reflectively
into
a
crisp
triangle
of
toast
since
i
become
so
clever
at
eating
and
drinking
there
a
sense
of
adventure
about
these
commonplace
functions
which
no
whole
person
could
ever
comprehend
sarah
busying
herself
with
details
of
and
counterpanes
watching
me
meanwhile
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
waited
until
i
had
turned
indifferently
to
my
pillows
again
before
making
the
following
terse
but
thrilling
remark
your
pink
come
into
blossom
miss
mavis
here
was
news
indeed
my
unconcern
took
unto
itself
wings
and
flew
away
not
really
i
cried
oh
sarah
how
perfectly
darling
of
her
to
waken
so
early
sarah
accustomed
to
my
extravagant
fashion
of
endowing
all
growing
things
with
distinct
personalities
nodded
gravely
and
then
with
all
the
majesty
of
jove
if
one
may
picture
that
deity
as
female
fifty
and
new
england
incarnate
she
launched
her
thunderbolt
of
green
hill
gossip
that
young
doctor
him
that
was
to
come
from
the
city
to
help
doctor
mcallister
with
his
patien
he
here
there
was
more
truth
than
enunciation
in
sarah
neglect
of
that
final
t
in
patients
our
village
doctor
is
long
on
wisdom
but
short
of
temper
i
reached
out
for
the
morning
paper
lying
on
my
bedside
table
and
rustled
it
in
dismissal
how
interesting
i
murmured
successfully
concealing
any
concern
at
all
sarah
swooped
down
upon
my
tray
and
bore
it
to
the
door
in
a
manner
which
carried
conviction
but
we
can
deceive
each
other
so
little
sarah
and
i
come
last
night
she
volunteered
from
new
york
and
every
girl
in
green
hill
is
furbishing
up
her
sunday
clothes
so
sammy
said
sammy
surnamed
simpson
the
mercury
who
delivers
the
milk
and
is
in
close
touch
with
all
the
divers
of
green
hill
holds
a
sentimental
if
unacknowledged
appeal
for
sarah
a
century
or
two
ago
sammy
father
in
those
days
a
gay
and
unencumbered
spark
courted
my
sarah
so
runs
the
story
in
the
public
manner
of
green
hill
and
sarah
difficult
to
believe
though
it
be
showed
him
no
disfavor
there
was
however
an
obstacle
to
eventual
union
in
the
person
of
sarah
invalid
mother
a
querulous
tyrant
upon
this
rock
the
frail
bark
of
the
simpson
affections
shattered
this
is
of
history
the
most
ancient
but
had
the
result
that
sarah
whose
lot
seems
ever
cast
among
the
stricken
now
waits
on
me
heart
hand
and
foot
while
over
the
simpson
hearthstone
another
goddess
presides
and
rigidly
too
if
one
can
judge
from
the
harrassed
expressions
of
sammy
sammy
and
all
the
other
innumerable
simpson
olive
branches
but
to
return
to
our
muttons
the
palpitating
girlhood
of
green
hill
silly
geese
i
commented
unkindly
sarah
from
the
doorway
looked
as
cryptic
as
is
consistent
with
the
features
nature
had
given
her
oh
i
do
know
she
answered
with
spirit
and
an
unconscious
effect
of
argot
in
green
hill
miss
mavis
men
is
scarce
here
was
truth
mentally
i
echoed
they
is
and
sarah
reading
ratification
in
my
silence
achieved
a
disappearance
of
my
tray
and
returned
to
the
attack
sammy
says
he
was
down
to
the
station
last
night
when
the
come
in
seems
like
she
digressed
he
always
hanging
around
the
station
since
rosie
allan
been
telegraph
operator
there
rosie
is
a
very
pretty
girl
sarah
i
chided
gently
pretty
is
as
pretty
does
said
sarah
in
irrefutable
limb
i
call
her
bold
as
brass
but
then
she
added
in
her
most
pleasant
tone
sammy
was
never
raised
to
know
better
and
she
looked
at
me
with
that
unique
light
in
her
eyes
which
never
fails
them
of
the
mention
of
any
simpson
delinquency
however
slight
sammy
says
she
continued
bound
to
pursue
the
subject
to
the
bitter
end
that
the
new
doctor
is
a
young
fellow
and
seems
well
off
at
this
juncture
i
opened
my
paper
with
an
air
of
finality
if
this
stranger
in
our
midst
is
as
you
infer
young
handsome
and
wealthy
i
remarked
why
then
in
heaven
name
has
he
descended
upon
green
hill
sarah
i
hate
handsome
men
they
are
always
so
much
vainer
than
women
sarah
accustomed
as
she
is
to
my
intemperate
habits
of
speech
regarded
me
with
a
somewhat
shocked
air
sammy
says
she
quoted
and
here
the
conversational
cat
leaped
from
the
bag
that
he
come
down
here
because
he
is
suffering
from
nerves
the
door
closed
after
her
but
her
contempt
lingered
almost
tangibly
in
the
room
and
i
smothered
my
laughter
in
the
pillows
but
sarah
had
given
me
something
to
think
about
i
have
known
so
few
men
young
ones
that
perhaps
i
am
given
to
speculating
about
them
even
more
than
the
average
girl
they
such
an
unknown
quality
and
certainly
the
one
or
two
who
have
been
escorted
to
my
presence
have
not
shown
to
good
advantage
the
healthy
man
reacts
unfavorably
to
invalid
feminism
they
are
bored
or
too
sympathetic
they
speak
in
whispers
or
in
too
cheery
tones
they
shuffle
their
great
feet
and
escape
eventually
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
i
am
impatient
of
them
of
their
bulk
and
their
strength
and
the
arrogance
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
their
sex
perhaps
it
is
because
i
am
handicapped
circumstantially
out
of
the
running
so
as
to
speak
that
an
eligible
male
always
arouses
in
me
a
feeling
of
antagonism
and
yet
with
not
unremarkable
inconsistency
i
always
wish
wistfully
deep
down
that
i
might
make
sometime
a
man
friend
of
my
own
generation
but
i
ca
something
in
me
shuts
doors
and
bolts
them
in
any
strange
masculine
face
a
breeze
stole
delicately
through
my
open
window
and
ruffled
my
hair
luring
my
eyes
to
the
world
where
young
summer
goes
walking
today
clad
in
blue
and
green
not
far
off
the
hills
which
give
our
town
its
pretty
name
rise
mistily
like
altars
just
beyond
that
tall
tangle
of
oak
trees
a
little
river
comes
singing
from
its
source
in
winter
i
miss
its
friendly
voice
yet
i
am
more
in
sympathy
with
it
then
for
its
bright
limbs
fettered
its
dancing
stilled
it
seems
kin
to
such
as
i
but
for
me
there
will
never
dawn
a
springtide
with
the
prison
keys
in
her
green
girdle
and
rosy
hands
outstretched
to
unlock
the
door
year
in
year
out
my
bed
is
always
close
to
the
windows
all
of
that
i
may
see
and
hear
i
must
have
for
my
own
i
love
every
glimpse
and
scent
and
sound
of
it
only
the
aggressive
shriek
of
the
train
at
the
distant
crossing
makes
me
shrink
and
shudder
that
was
the
last
thing
i
heard
a
whistle
at
a
crossing
before
the
day
coach
which
was
carrying
me
home
from
a
happy
visit
plunged
over
the
embankment
eleven
years
ago
it
seems
like
many
centuries
yet
i
remember
it
as
i
remember
yesterday
that
crash
before
oblivion
i
can
remember
even
the
thrill
of
old
pride
in
the
dignity
of
that
journey
made
quite
alone
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
longer
journey
where
the
milestones
are
the
years
a
journey
painful
and
rebellious
marked
with
many
stations
of
weariness
and
black
tunnels
of
agony
a
journey
which
despite
all
the
loving
care
that
surrounds
me
i
must
make
in
isolation
of
body
and
spirit
oh
little
blue
diary
it
is
well
that
i
may
shut
away
my
moods
and
my
mutiny
between
your
covers
no
one
in
all
this
house
must
be
made
sadder
because
of
me
not
father
unfailing
playmate
and
tender
not
sarah
whose
silent
affection
is
like
protecting
arms
about
me
there
a
great
shaft
of
sunlight
quivering
across
what
i
just
written
incongruous
somehow
and
i
out
of
tune
with
the
june
weather
and
the
birds
just
beyond
my
windows
i
must
ask
sarah
to
bring
me
my
first
rose
from
my
sleeping
beauty
bush
first
roses
are
always
the
sweetest
like
the
kiss
of
prince
charming
i
wonder
what
the
nervous
doctor
name
is
poor
sarah
june
paid
me
a
visit
this
afternoon
while
i
slept
she
was
reluctant
to
waken
me
but
left
me
her
prettiest
card
the
first
roses
from
my
bush
they
have
been
happily
translated
to
a
vase
beside
me
as
i
write
father
brought
them
upstairs
with
him
when
he
came
in
for
tea
did
you
kiss
her
hands
and
tell
her
how
sorry
i
would
be
to
miss
her
i
asked
him
soberly
father
looked
alarmed
whose
hands
he
began
who
has
called
on
us
today
mrs
withers
he
answered
suppressing
a
groan
rudely
i
laughed
surely
mavis
father
continued
plaintively
you
could
never
demand
that
i
kiss
i
laughed
again
withers
ugly
name
is
it
is
the
wife
of
our
pastor
she
is
a
good
woman
but
she
possesses
little
charm
i
just
touched
my
roses
with
a
cautious
june
has
been
here
you
prosaic
person
i
said
witness
these
and
then
deny
it
if
you
can
father
relieved
leaned
back
in
my
comfortable
armchair
at
least
i
know
it
comfortable
i
did
not
see
her
he
said
that
is
not
until
i
entered
this
room
and
found
her
wearing
my
daughter
most
becoming
face
father
is
so
satisfactory
i
sure
i
bridled
bring
me
a
mirror
immediately
i
demanded
father
rose
obediently
to
his
lean
height
and
fumbled
among
the
things
on
my
dresser
for
the
fat
silver
mirror
adorned
with
its
charmingly
ugly
cupids
which
had
been
my
mother
there
miss
vanity
he
said
and
while
i
studied
my
reflection
he
studied
me
from
under
his
bushy
brows
finally
in
silence
i
gave
him
back
the
glass
well
asked
father
well
i
responded
which
was
not
courteous
do
you
find
yourself
prettier
than
yesterday
oh
much
i
answered
with
conviction
after
all
there
are
compensations
in
the
possession
of
a
pointed
face
decorated
with
big
dark
eyes
and
a
delightful
mouth
my
nose
has
never
pleased
me
but
always
when
i
am
gloomiest
my
hair
affords
me
consolation
sarah
makes
a
household
pet
of
it
and
cares
for
it
devotedly
there
heaps
of
it
so
much
that
it
makes
my
head
ache
to
wear
it
piled
high
so
it
generally
lies
in
two
long
braids
across
the
sheets
father
i
asked
what
color
is
my
hair
he
leaned
forward
and
lifted
one
of
the
braids
exactly
the
color
of
cloudy
amber
he
answered
i
pondered
on
this
for
a
time
and
then
that
i
said
sounds
very
nice
but
improbable
we
smiled
at
one
another
but
suddenly
the
laughter
left
his
eyes
and
he
bent
to
kiss
my
forehead
perhaps
to
hide
his
face
you
grow
more
lovely
every
day
mavis
he
said
gravely
could
anything
be
sweeter
than
a
father
who
says
all
those
little
lover
things
to
one
i
think
not
i
laid
my
cheek
against
his
hand
he
has
nice
hands
quick
to
soothe
and
caress
nothing
is
quite
unendurable
with
father
near
you
should
be
a
poet
i
told
him
sometimes
i
think
you
are
instead
of
a
historian
nothing
in
the
world
can
ever
make
me
believe
that
you
write
books
for
people
to
read
do
they
read
them
i
inquired
as
an
afterthought
mavis
he
shook
his
finger
at
me
in
mock
indignation
well
i
answered
truthfully
mediaeval
history
must
be
dull
sure
i
ca
remember
any
of
it
here
our
argument
but
half
commenced
ceased
for
father
with
an
exclamation
plunged
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
and
after
a
time
produced
a
slim
sober
volume
here
it
is
he
cried
in
triumph
here
is
what
i
asked
in
some
astonishment
how
you
do
dash
about
father
your
mind
turns
all
sorts
of
corners
what
is
it
mediaeval
history
certainly
not
minx
poetry
poetry
he
laid
the
book
on
the
bed
and
my
hands
pounced
upon
it
like
two
white
cats
on
a
small
brown
mouse
i
been
starving
for
some
i
announced
and
turned
the
book
over
to
read
the
title
lyric
hour
by
richard
where
i
asked
tucking
my
treasure
under
my
pillow
did
you
get
it
it
came
in
the
morning
mail
he
answered
i
looked
at
him
searchingly
there
is
i
ventured
some
mystery
about
this
father
laughed
and
fished
once
more
in
his
pockets
here
is
the
letter
which
came
with
it
he
said
i
opened
the
envelope
which
bore
the
name
of
father
publisher
and
good
friend
and
read
new
york
city
june
dear
carroll
i
sending
you
your
delayed
proofs
and
by
way
of
apology
and
distraction
the
volume
of
verse
which
has
created
such
a
sensation
in
literary
and
critical
circles
those
two
kingdoms
which
occasionally
overlap
but
are
not
always
completely
allied
i
feel
certain
that
you
and
mavis
will
enjoy
richard
warren
old
and
sedate
as
i
have
grown
with
the
years
i
must
confess
that
he
has
made
my
pulses
quicken
and
my
heart
take
on
something
of
its
youth
again
with
warmest
remembrances
to
you
both
faithfully
yours
john
denton
i
gave
the
letter
back
to
father
it
must
be
some
book
i
remarked
with
awe
if
slangily
father
raised
an
eyebrow
why
denton
and
pulses
i
quoted
with
a
rising
inflection
why
not
interrogated
my
parent
a
contemporary
of
mine
and
mavis
you
must
admit
an
admirer
of
yours
i
was
flattered
into
silence
and
turned
my
attention
to
my
roses
once
more
father
chewed
his
pipe
stem
a
reprehensible
habit
and
made
an
announcement
we
had
another
caller
today
he
said
you
as
bad
as
sarah
for
concealing
things
until
the
eleventh
hour
i
reproached
him
who
was
it
denton
nephew
this
in
green
hill
phraseology
really
fetched
me
i
stared
did
know
he
had
one
i
said
somewhat
aggrieved
who
is
he
and
what
is
he
doing
here
father
stretched
out
his
long
legs
preparatory
to
explanation
it
a
long
story
he
said
briefly
this
is
a
prodigal
nephew
there
has
been
some
family
feud
in
the
denton
clan
but
recently
done
away
with
when
the
hatchet
was
buried
denton
got
into
touch
with
his
late
brother
family
which
consists
of
a
wife
and
an
only
son
who
is
a
doctor
he
has
just
recovered
from
a
slight
overwork
i
believe
and
denton
through
me
arranged
to
have
him
come
here
to
recuperate
and
at
the
same
time
to
assist
our
good
friend
mcallister
in
some
of
his
surgical
research
by
this
time
my
mind
was
putting
two
and
two
together
and
making
eight
or
nine
not
doctor
denton
i
asked
doctor
denton
father
nodded
perhaps
he
began
wistfully
but
i
shook
my
head
please
not
i
said
and
he
left
me
with
his
sentence
unspoken
but
i
knew
we
had
both
read
so
much
of
the
young
surgeon
who
had
effected
wonderful
cures
in
cases
similar
to
mine
it
had
never
occurred
to
either
of
us
at
the
time
that
he
might
be
of
john
denton
family
but
i
knew
that
father
often
wished
out
loud
that
he
might
consult
with
him
about
me
deploring
the
fact
that
he
was
in
europe
but
for
a
number
of
years
i
have
begged
so
hard
that
no
more
doctors
be
let
loose
to
probe
and
pound
me
a
process
of
infinite
torture
with
no
results
save
deeper
hopelessness
and
white
nights
that
father
promised
so
i
have
been
left
in
peace
lazily
i
wondered
why
father
had
not
told
me
sooner
of
his
discovery
and
subsequent
arrangement
with
doctor
mac
but
i
had
a
bad
siege
of
it
a
while
back
and
probably
during
that
very
period
the
matter
had
come
up
doubtless
when
i
had
finally
struggled
up
again
from
my
depths
father
once
more
lost
to
the
world
among
his
books
had
forgotten
i
lay
silent
watching
a
bird
seesaw
on
the
vine
which
clambers
over
my
in
friendly
fashion
long
past
your
i
remarked
severely
but
it
cheeped
at
me
impudently
i
wonder
what
doctor
denton
looks
like
thin
i
fancy
professional
and
probably
very
jumpy
but
i
can
not
condemn
his
nerves
quite
as
harshly
as
i
know
sarah
does
i
have
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
nerves
myself
i
meant
to
indulge
in
lyric
tonight
but
my
little
blue
friend
has
claimed
all
of
my
time
i
will
save
warren
therefore
for
another
day
like
icing
on
a
cake
the
book
lies
under
my
pillow
still
barely
peeped
at
perhaps
i
shall
sleep
better
with
that
ship
of
song
beneath
my
cheek
diary
good
night
hours
later
oh
diary
i
have
found
him
and
i
do
know
and
care
less
whether
he
is
twenty
or
ninety
fat
or
thin
married
or
single
the
only
thing
in
all
the
world
which
i
am
sure
of
at
present
is
that
he
is
mine
for
i
have
him
locked
up
between
two
vellum
doors
from
which
he
shall
never
escape
he
here
and
never
in
all
my
life
has
anyone
so
thoroughly
belonged
to
me
i
the
heart
and
brains
and
beautiful
spirit
of
him
and
all
day
long
his
name
makes
a
happy
spot
in
my
conscience
warren
richard
warren
i
hold
the
book
that
he
has
given
to
the
world
between
my
hands
in
reverence
for
all
that
i
have
hoped
and
dreamed
and
lived
in
my
life
all
that
i
have
ever
wanted
to
be
all
that
in
my
secret
i
have
worshipped
in
god
and
nature
and
love
of
love
is
written
down
here
for
me
to
read
and
make
doubly
my
own
i
do
know
who
or
what
he
is
diary
in
the
outside
world
and
it
does
matter
nothing
matters
but
this
one
little
book
to
which
he
has
set
his
name
for
everything
worth
while
is
here
dust
of
stars
and
wine
of
dreams
essence
of
youth
and
joy
of
living
given
and
yet
these
are
not
words
so
much
as
they
are
music
and
color
and
fragrance
i
just
been
reading
and
reading
and
now
i
laid
the
book
aside
and
have
been
lying
here
idly
letting
broken
snatches
of
purest
beauty
drift
through
my
mind
and
for
the
first
time
i
find
myself
regretting
the
shade
of
my
eyes
for
my
new
companion
sings
of
grey
eyes
as
pure
as
god
first
dream
of
stars
but
perhaps
it
just
that
grey
lends
itself
more
easily
to
poetry
than
common
or
garden
brown
diary
i
wonder
if
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
book
but
what
a
satisfactory
state
of
heart
to
be
in
after
all
i
can
banish
my
lover
with
so
little
effort
if
ever
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
him
i
can
even
cast
him
into
the
fire
if
he
ever
bores
me
and
i
am
sure
that
the
most
lovelorn
maiden
on
earth
must
have
moments
when
she
would
envy
that
faculty
and
when
i
finally
relent
as
all
true
lovers
must
how
simple
it
has
been
made
for
me
to
buy
a
new
copy
of
the
beloved
good
night
sweet
gossip
as
the
ladies
of
shakespeare
time
were
wont
to
say
you
such
a
comfort
and
you
not
tell
will
you
that
richard
warren
and
all
his
words
lie
once
again
beneath
my
pillow
june
it
raining
silver
fingers
are
tapping
at
my
window
pane
and
father
morning
offering
of
roses
came
to
me
with
their
darling
faces
all
wet
and
gleaming
i
hated
the
weather
when
i
woke
up
but
in
my
which
holds
so
many
many
lyric
hours
for
me
there
a
little
verse
about
the
rain
which
patters
through
my
mind
as
soothingly
as
the
drops
outside
so
i
become
almost
reconciled
to
a
dull
day
devoid
of
visitors
and
with
sarah
complaining
of
rheumatics
i
shall
begin
to
grumble
about
them
myself
soon
for
aware
of
warnings
in
my
spine
which
bode
no
good
i
too
tired
to
write
more
diary
july
since
last
i
set
pen
to
your
paper
blue
one
i
have
descended
into
sloughs
of
despair
now
emerged
again
i
take
up
my
story
where
i
left
it
a
day
or
so
after
the
last
time
i
talked
with
you
i
had
an
attack
of
the
sort
which
has
mercifully
been
spared
me
for
over
a
year
it
had
been
coming
on
steadily
but
i
was
going
to
give
in
to
it
oh
no
so
the
first
intimation
which
father
and
sarah
had
of
its
arrival
was
late
one
night
when
a
moan
that
i
had
been
biting
back
for
an
hour
tore
its
way
to
freedom
past
my
closed
lips
and
revealed
its
presence
surprisingly
in
the
shape
of
a
scream
sarah
came
flying
to
my
bed
and
hard
on
her
heels
father
they
gave
me
such
remedies
as
are
always
at
hand
and
which
generally
prove
friendly
but
this
time
they
failed
my
demon
had
been
in
abeyance
too
long
and
was
reluctant
to
loosen
his
clutches
once
made
free
of
my
flesh
he
would
listen
to
no
reason
presently
there
came
a
period
of
through
which
i
dimly
heard
father
at
the
telephone
calling
mcallister
number
i
almost
smiled
through
the
creeping
faintness
to
think
how
annoyed
he
would
profess
himself
to
be
called
out
of
bed
at
this
ungodly
hour
and
how
once
arrived
he
would
toil
to
help
me
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
after
what
seemed
years
it
was
with
a
vague
sense
of
amazement
that
doctor
mac
had
grown
so
young
since
last
i
had
seen
him
for
he
was
slim
where
once
he
had
been
inclined
to
rotundity
and
where
once
he
had
been
sparse
and
grey
upon
my
pulse
was
an
unfamiliar
hand
and
a
strange
voice
close
to
me
was
saying
quietly
she
coming
round
mr
carroll
somehow
this
calm
disposition
of
me
was
annoying
i
not
i
heard
myself
contradict
weakly
two
eyes
set
in
a
lean
face
met
mine
it
was
not
a
friendly
encounter
please
do
talk
ordered
this
new
doctor
mac
briefly
father
laid
his
hand
upon
my
forehead
is
the
pain
better
dear
he
asked
with
that
break
in
his
voice
which
always
comes
when
he
knows
that
i
am
suffering
i
tried
to
flash
triumph
into
the
blue
eyes
and
responded
yes
then
as
my
demon
jaws
took
a
fresh
hold
on
my
spinal
column
oh
no
there
was
a
consultation
and
then
father
said
reassuringly
do
talk
mavis
dear
and
lie
quiet
doctor
denton
is
going
to
give
you
something
to
relieve
you
i
felt
six
years
old
again
and
resentful
to
find
father
going
over
to
the
enemy
but
i
was
grateful
that
after
all
our
own
dear
doctor
mac
had
not
been
metamorphosed
into
an
ogre
with
icicle
eyes
as
the
tiny
merciful
piston
went
home
i
said
feebly
with
malice
aforethought
hello
and
the
last
thing
i
saw
before
i
fell
asleep
was
his
startled
face
and
in
my
first
i
found
myself
repeating
childishly
he
did
jump
he
and
i
made
him
and
that
dear
diary
was
my
informal
introduction
to
the
nervous
nephew
of
john
denton
chapter
ii
doctor
denton
came
in
this
morning
he
has
been
in
every
day
since
that
and
we
preserve
an
armed
neutrality
with
one
another
i
had
even
grown
rather
to
like
him
not
for
himself
so
much
as
for
the
engaging
way
his
hair
grows
and
for
the
sensitive
spatulate
fingers
of
the
born
surgeon
but
after
his
visit
of
this
morning
my
little
liking
has
retreated
as
those
crocuses
which
leave
warm
earth
prematurely
are
sent
shuddering
into
nothingness
by
the
breath
of
an
inimical
frost
here
what
happened
the
roses
started
and
finished
it
my
room
is
quite
full
of
them
today
everywhere
i
look
is
just
a
blur
of
color
i
think
that
earth
is
particularly
lavish
this
season
when
father
brought
doctor
denton
in
and
left
us
to
what
he
fondly
termed
a
nice
chat
the
following
conversation
ensued
good
morning
miss
carroll
good
morning
doctor
denton
after
a
few
professional
inquiries
as
to
the
state
of
health
in
which
the
morning
had
found
me
and
my
satisfactory
answers
silence
i
watched
him
stride
restlessly
about
my
room
until
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
then
i
said
briefly
lovely
day
is
it
came
a
growl
which
translated
i
took
to
signify
hot
i
know
now
just
how
water
feels
trying
to
wear
away
the
proverbial
stone
exhausted
by
my
efforts
i
leaned
back
among
my
pillows
and
closed
my
eyes
presently
doctor
denton
came
and
drew
a
chair
close
to
the
bed
your
roses
are
wonderful
he
remarked
conversationally
here
was
a
subject
on
which
i
can
not
fail
to
become
eloquent
i
opened
my
eyes
this
was
a
mistake
for
in
so
doing
i
met
that
glance
which
always
disconcerts
me
they
are
i
said
and
let
the
opening
pass
i
like
to
see
some
there
he
continued
very
rudely
pointing
his
finger
at
my
face
i
put
my
hands
hastily
to
my
cheeks
now
he
announced
with
satisfaction
that
more
like
diary
it
stupid
of
me
to
blush
you
do
not
admire
pallor
i
asked
politely
certainly
not
the
pallor
of
was
the
professional
answer
it
may
be
poetic
but
it
is
hardly
practical
you
do
not
admire
poetry
doctor
denton
ceased
twirling
one
of
my
loveliest
roses
between
his
fingers
and
leaned
forward
to
lay
it
carefully
across
my
nearest
braid
gravely
considering
the
effect
he
replied
not
as
a
steady
diet
i
slipped
my
hand
under
my
pillow
and
closed
it
down
hard
over
a
certain
volume
i
do
not
suppose
that
surgery
and
poetry
are
particularly
compatible
i
volunteered
with
indifference
he
lifted
the
rose
from
my
braid
and
regarded
it
when
he
looked
up
i
was
astonished
to
see
a
light
in
the
alaskan
eyes
which
i
never
dreamed
could
live
in
so
cold
a
climate
you
all
wrong
he
answered
there
a
tremendous
amount
of
poetry
in
surgery
beauty
too
and
limitless
romance
i
did
know
those
words
were
in
his
vocabulary
a
trifle
stirred
by
his
tone
i
made
a
little
of
scepticism
instruments
and
white
coats
and
ether
i
was
beginning
when
he
interrupted
me
and
beyond
them
all
he
finished
on
a
deeper
note
the
poetry
of
healing
i
fell
silent
somehow
that
view
of
things
had
never
occurred
to
me
where
one
might
see
poetry
i
saw
only
pain
perhaps
my
face
showed
something
of
what
i
was
remembering
for
suddenly
he
rose
and
leaned
over
me
let
me
make
you
more
comfortable
he
suggested
and
slipping
a
steady
arm
beneath
my
shoulders
there
more
strength
concealed
in
the
slim
length
of
him
than
one
would
imagine
he
held
me
closely
while
with
the
other
hand
he
pounded
my
pillows
and
settled
them
firmly
again
something
slid
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
oh
i
said
as
he
stooped
to
recover
it
i
put
out
my
hands
but
he
was
turning
the
book
over
poetry
he
said
pleasantly
and
raised
an
eyebrow
i
did
care
much
for
his
tone
have
you
read
it
i
asked
belligerently
lyric
no
do
you
care
then
so
much
for
rhymesters
for
this
one
i
answered
annoyed
to
confession
that
explains
it
explains
what
the
night
you
were
ill
doctor
denton
went
on
calmly
to
reveal
you
called
me
i
felt
the
hot
color
rise
to
my
cheeks
again
well
nothing
only
my
name
happens
to
be
bill
it
would
be
i
remarked
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
miss
carroll
but
i
only
smiled
angelically
and
asked
when
do
you
expect
doctor
mcallister
back
again
doctor
denton
i
do
not
know
that
my
tone
implied
all
that
i
felt
but
i
saw
the
eyes
grow
very
dark
and
thank
you
said
doctor
denton
stiffly
i
felt
somewhat
ashamed
and
tried
to
make
amends
please
read
lyric
doctor
i
urged
in
my
prettiest
party
voice
you
will
find
it
really
worth
while
the
creature
is
after
all
occasionally
understanding
he
smiled
forgivingly
at
me
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
book
but
i
meant
that
oh
i
said
hastily
not
my
copy
as
precious
as
all
that
he
asked
putting
his
rejected
hand
in
his
pocket
this
i
ignored
tell
john
denton
to
send
you
out
a
copy
i
suggested
he
sent
us
this
one
the
devil
he
did
i
looked
my
surprise
and
my
visitor
laughed
he
has
a
very
nice
laugh
considering
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
carroll
i
am
apt
to
be
a
trifle
he
paused
and
considered
me
narrowly
eh
jumpy
and
i
did
know
my
uncle
john
went
in
for
ethereal
chaps
ethereal
the
word
on
those
lips
was
an
insult
i
glared
at
him
rather
conscious
that
i
must
look
like
a
sick
kitten
father
came
in
providentially
how
is
she
doctor
he
asked
which
was
absurd
as
i
had
reassured
him
concerning
my
welfare
not
two
hours
earlier
rather
scrappy
lots
of
fight
left
answered
our
guest
rising
i
was
speechless
i
think
said
doctor
denton
we
shall
have
to
get
her
out
of
doors
father
and
i
stared
at
him
why
not
he
continued
looking
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
commence
by
building
her
up
a
bit
and
trying
massage
for
those
unused
muscles
then
a
little
later
it
should
be
quite
easy
to
carry
her
comfortably
downstairs
and
settle
her
on
a
cot
under
the
trees
for
a
little
while
each
day
mcallister
began
father
doubtfully
oh
i
talk
with
him
cut
in
doctor
denton
cheerfully
he
will
be
back
next
week
he
added
turning
deliberately
to
me
i
looked
grateful
how
perfectly
splendid
i
said
with
a
ring
of
real
enthusiasm
in
my
voice
i
missed
him
so
much
father
looked
mildly
surprised
at
so
much
fervor
and
i
am
sure
the
creature
concealed
a
smile
as
he
departed
with
father
to
talk
things
over
doctor
denton
turned
at
the
door
less
poetry
miss
carroll
he
admonished
parentally
that
what
i
tell
her
said
father
surrendering
to
the
foe
the
child
reads
too
much
it
makes
her
fanciful
and
does
take
her
mind
off
herself
suggested
the
doctor
nastily
i
wonder
diary
what
he
meant
we
take
away
her
books
he
went
on
and
give
her
sunshine
and
fresh
air
and
green
trees
in
their
place
against
my
will
i
admitted
it
would
be
glorious
the
outdoors
part
of
the
program
you
see
he
turned
to
father
doctors
are
rather
like
gardeners
i
for
one
am
interested
in
roses
roses
echoed
my
parent
who
seemed
to
pass
from
one
stage
of
astonishment
to
the
other
as
the
morning
progressed
roses
repeated
doctor
denton
firmly
there
a
particularly
pretty
white
one
that
i
am
anxious
to
cultivate
i
believe
with
care
and
sunlight
it
could
be
urged
to
bloom
quite
deep
pink
permanently
he
looked
at
me
as
he
said
this
last
then
with
a
polite
good
morning
miss
carroll
he
left
the
room
i
hate
him
but
diary
would
it
be
altogether
wonderful
if
we
could
be
taken
together
i
wonder
what
that
doctor
person
did
with
the
flower
he
stole
from
my
vase
green
hill
july
diary
i
dreamed
a
horrid
dream
last
night
i
dreamed
that
i
stood
with
richard
warren
on
some
high
wooded
place
in
my
dreams
diary
i
can
always
stand
with
my
hands
close
in
his
i
could
see
his
face
but
i
knew
him
somehow
and
his
voice
was
in
my
ears
just
saying
my
name
over
and
over
mavis
but
as
the
mist
cleared
before
my
eyes
someone
said
far
off
ethereal
and
laughed
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
not
richard
warren
poet
and
dreamer
of
dreams
but
william
denton
surgeon
and
scoffer
it
all
sounds
so
foolish
diary
written
down
but
it
was
really
quite
dreadful
sarah
who
must
have
heard
me
call
out
for
in
my
dream
i
wrenched
my
hands
away
and
screamed
appeared
at
my
bedside
like
a
familiar
ghost
how
i
welcomed
her
innumerable
tightly
plaited
braids
and
all
breathe
it
not
in
gath
but
in
this
unpleasant
fashion
does
sarah
achieve
her
crinkled
morning
coiffure
she
tucked
me
in
secured
a
flapping
shade
forced
a
potion
of
hot
milk
down
my
unwilling
throat
and
left
me
so
finally
i
slept
again
to
dream
no
more
this
morning
a
note
came
to
me
from
denton
so
nice
a
man
to
have
so
wretched
a
relation
new
york
city
july
my
dear
little
mavis
your
good
father
is
so
poor
a
correspondent
that
i
have
struck
his
name
from
my
but
you
are
always
considerate
of
a
lonely
old
man
therefore
i
write
to
inform
him
through
you
that
i
am
leaving
this
asphalt
wilderness
presently
for
the
white
mountains
perhaps
when
my
vacation
there
draws
to
a
close
i
may
drop
down
to
see
you
before
returning
to
the
grind
i
shall
look
forward
to
a
pleasant
visit
with
you
and
a
quarrelsome
time
with
your
father
to
whom
despite
his
neglect
of
me
i
beg
to
be
remembered
i
am
sending
you
some
books
and
some
exotic
fruit
hoping
to
tempt
your
literary
and
physical
palates
respectively
my
nephew
writes
me
that
he
has
seen
you
i
envy
him
but
i
am
more
than
sorry
my
dear
that
your
first
encounter
should
have
taken
place
under
such
unfortunate
circumstances
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
for
any
kindness
you
care
to
show
him
for
he
has
not
had
a
very
happy
albeit
successful
career
and
he
is
far
from
his
western
home
and
his
people
remember
me
to
your
elderly
and
amiable
handmaiden
whose
beaten
biscuit
i
recall
with
such
felicity
write
me
now
and
then
mavis
and
if
i
can
in
any
way
be
of
service
to
you
you
have
but
to
command
me
faithfully
and
affectionately
your
friend
john
denton
how
did
you
like
lyric
this
afternoon
the
fruit
and
books
arrived
quantities
of
both
sammy
simpson
who
adds
the
arduous
duties
of
expressman
to
those
of
milk
purveyor
staggered
upstairs
under
the
burden
of
them
into
this
very
room
with
his
own
hands
ably
chaperoned
by
sarah
he
brought
them
we
had
a
little
conversation
it
ran
something
like
this
mavis
good
afternoon
sammy
sammy
afternoon
miss
mavis
m
how
is
everyone
at
home
sammy
s
pretty
fair
thank
you
m
anything
exciting
happen
in
green
hill
lately
sammy
s
nothin
in
perticular
miss
mavis
here
sarah
made
a
remark
why
sammy
you
told
me
yourself
not
ten
minutes
back
that
your
folks
found
old
man
thomas
hanging
to
the
rafters
of
his
own
barn
this
morning
sammy
in
deep
disgust
oh
him
sarah
sharply
suppose
you
think
a
hanging
aint
nothing
worth
mentioning
sammy
to
which
the
youth
defensively
well
it
kinder
slipped
my
mind
why
sammy
i
here
ejaculated
with
real
horror
that
dreadful
sammy
shifted
to
his
other
foot
for
a
change
yes
he
remarked
paw
found
him
that
the
third
man
he
continued
with
satisfaction
that
paw
cut
down
he
never
did
have
much
luck
sarah
looked
triumphant
i
making
a
miraculous
recovery
inquired
i
wonder
why
he
did
such
a
thing
thomas
i
mean
wife
druv
him
volunteered
sammy
cheerfully
i
tried
to
appear
shocked
but
sarah
answered
with
bitterness
could
stand
living
with
himself
any
longer
like
as
not
but
sammy
ignoring
her
turned
to
me
and
said
with
conviction
wimmen
miss
mavis
is
the
dickens
here
the
conversation
ended
sammy
departed
with
a
tug
of
his
tow
forelock
doubtless
a
legacy
from
ancestors
who
now
sleep
quietly
across
the
ocean
sarah
bustled
him
out
of
the
room
as
one
shoos
chickens
and
i
lay
back
on
my
pillows
and
laughed
there
is
more
to
sammy
melancholy
than
meets
the
eye
i
seem
to
see
rosie
fine
yankee
hand
in
this
however
sooner
or
later
i
shall
solve
the
mystery
for
all
green
hill
comes
now
and
again
to
this
peaceful
room
i
peeped
into
my
new
books
and
nibbled
at
something
which
starts
out
by
acting
like
a
peach
and
ends
up
by
becoming
an
apricot
and
now
i
will
write
to
my
fairy
godfather
for
i
have
a
great
idea
diary
which
i
will
not
confide
to
you
until
it
has
taken
shape
green
hill
july
we
been
celebrating
today
even
unto
firecrackers
under
my
window
i
am
only
grateful
that
they
were
not
under
my
bed
doctor
denton
who
arrived
this
morning
with
doctor
mac
in
tow
unbent
sufficiently
to
present
me
with
a
small
silk
flag
i
was
coldly
sweet
to
him
but
warmly
so
to
his
companion
it
nice
to
have
doctor
mac
at
home
language
and
all
he
was
led
into
the
room
by
his
younger
colleague
and
brought
to
my
bedside
with
an
air
of
eureka
behold
my
handiwork
doctor
mac
is
very
much
pleased
with
my
appearance
from
a
medical
standpoint
and
before
the
two
of
them
departed
it
was
practically
settled
that
i
should
begin
the
massage
so
that
the
campaign
might
be
started
i
informed
doctor
denton
that
i
had
a
letter
from
his
uncle
to
which
he
remarked
did
know
you
corresponded
curiously
enough
the
news
appeared
to
annoy
him
diary
here
is
the
letter
which
went
to
the
white
mountains
today
may
your
covers
turn
red
if
ever
you
divulge
it
green
hill
july
dear
denton
first
of
all
a
thousand
thanks
for
your
letter
the
books
and
the
fruit
but
how
can
you
prate
of
in
so
commonplace
a
fashion
and
then
shower
me
with
works
of
art
full
of
delicious
mystery
sarah
says
she
fears
i
shall
never
be
satisfied
with
green
hill
fare
again
i
believe
she
has
grounds
the
books
are
most
welcome
i
been
peering
at
wells
and
peeking
at
bennett
and
holding
my
breath
over
the
barrie
plays
i
shall
gorge
myself
on
the
printed
page
during
the
next
few
weeks
the
dearest
of
all
is
an
old
friend
who
comes
to
me
in
a
new
dress
how
in
the
world
did
you
remember
my
passion
for
and
her
unchanging
my
own
copy
is
worn
and
but
this
is
fresh
and
smiling
the
illustrations
are
too
quaint
and
i
love
her
already
thanks
and
again
thanks
yes
doctor
denton
has
become
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
carroll
cottage
father
likes
him
very
much
and
they
have
lengthy
arguments
in
the
study
evenings
sometimes
a
detached
word
or
the
scent
of
a
pipe
drifts
up
to
me
through
the
open
door
and
occasionally
the
two
come
and
sit
with
me
awhile
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
to
discover
your
nephew
in
our
new
doctor
one
would
never
dream
that
you
belonged
together
i
am
sure
that
father
is
glad
to
have
some
one
to
play
with
there
is
no
question
of
being
at
all
events
doctor
denton
does
not
appear
to
me
a
lonely
person
on
the
contrary
lyric
and
i
are
intimates
i
have
never
had
a
book
mean
so
much
to
me
not
even
who
keeps
me
alive
i
wonder
if
you
know
the
author
of
these
exquisite
verses
please
if
you
do
do
not
tell
me
anything
about
him
but
do
you
think
i
might
write
to
him
i
should
like
to
tell
him
of
the
pleasure
he
has
given
me
and
i
should
like
to
tell
him
through
you
rather
he
did
not
know
my
name
this
may
sound
very
foolish
as
i
know
that
writers
have
many
letters
from
the
public
but
we
people
have
moods
i
would
love
to
get
to
know
him
a
little
on
paper
do
you
think
he
would
mind
somehow
from
his
book
i
feel
he
might
understand
father
would
care
i
am
sure
the
queen
can
do
no
wrong
so
if
you
have
no
objection
to
playing
postman
nothing
remains
for
me
save
to
select
a
new
pen
and
commence
my
letter
but
i
will
not
do
that
until
i
hear
from
you
all
in
this
house
send
love
except
sarah
who
i
am
sure
would
not
think
it
quite
proper
but
she
would
tender
her
respectful
regards
to
you
did
she
know
i
was
writing
gratefully
and
affectionately
mavis
carroll
and
now
diary
i
have
set
the
wheels
revolving
and
what
the
next
white
mountain
post
will
bring
forth
i
know
not
green
hill
july
diary
i
am
afflicted
with
the
sensation
i
wish
i
had
not
written
to
denton
what
will
he
think
of
me
and
yet
it
seems
almost
justifiable
after
all
for
surely
i
am
quite
enough
not
to
have
my
impulses
questioned
or
to
be
accused
of
a
sentimental
ulterior
motive
and
it
is
certainly
patent
to
the
most
sceptic
that
i
shall
have
to
get
all
my
romance
vicariously
it
a
nice
day
came
in
this
morning
to
display
an
infinitesimal
bandaged
thumb
he
sat
on
a
firecracker
he
said
which
seems
to
have
had
an
odd
reaction
peter
has
been
so
busy
growing
up
of
late
that
every
time
he
hurtles
into
my
quiet
room
i
am
convinced
that
i
can
see
him
sprout
he
has
a
cupboard
love
for
sarah
but
i
think
that
his
affection
for
me
is
little
boys
are
awfully
dear
i
have
a
proprietary
interest
in
peter
the
night
he
was
born
i
watched
the
lights
of
the
house
next
door
until
my
eyes
closed
of
themselves
and
ever
since
he
was
a
round
baby
he
has
had
the
freedom
of
this
house
today
he
sat
upon
my
bed
and
informed
me
that
he
was
goin
visitin
i
gather
that
his
mother
goodrich
has
a
school
friend
who
is
spending
the
summer
some
forty
miles
away
at
a
small
hotel
i
asked
peter
if
he
were
eager
to
go
and
leave
me
i
asked
plaintively
i
be
home
soon
answered
peter
evasively
an
aunt
lily
awful
nice
but
awful
old
as
old
as
mother
added
the
ungallant
child
peter
is
seven
his
pretty
mother
is
i
envy
goodrich
very
much
i
envy
her
peter
with
a
passion
almost
pain
and
now
i
find
myself
envying
her
a
school
friend
girls
young
women
are
almost
as
strange
to
me
as
men
those
i
know
in
green
hill
are
charming
creatures
and
very
sweet
to
me
they
come
to
me
with
their
knitting
their
sewing
their
love
affairs
but
a
community
of
interests
is
not
ours
as
they
chatter
on
i
can
only
wonder
wistfully
what
it
must
be
like
to
golf
and
swim
ride
and
play
tennis
picnic
and
dance
to
do
all
the
every
day
things
which
they
take
so
much
for
granted
denton
came
in
today
to
see
how
i
had
recovered
from
the
fourth
and
his
call
coinciding
with
the
of
peter
visit
the
two
who
had
hitherto
had
but
a
bowing
acquaintance
as
the
doctor
put
it
became
instantly
the
best
of
friends
i
wish
i
liked
john
nephew
better
i
am
forced
to
agree
with
father
that
he
has
many
splendid
qualities
but
only
my
mind
agrees
once
or
twice
when
father
has
been
particularly
expansive
on
the
subject
i
have
caught
him
looking
at
me
in
a
puzzled
fashion
and
have
realized
that
my
tone
has
been
about
as
enthusiastic
as
a
yale
adherent
when
harvard
is
making
a
goal
yes
diary
i
read
the
papers
and
ask
quite
intelligent
questions
when
denton
is
the
subject
in
question
between
my
father
and
me
i
am
polite
very
just
but
unemotional
he
arouses
in
me
a
feeling
of
rebellion
and
plain
cussedness
perhaps
it
is
a
case
of
dr
fell
i
do
not
know
for
until
recently
fell
has
always
seemed
a
rather
maligned
and
misunderstood
character
to
me
but
not
now
and
yet
digging
further
in
the
soil
of
spontaneous
antagonism
i
am
forced
to
confess
that
my
dislike
is
deeper
and
even
more
illogically
rooted
it
is
not
pleasant
to
meet
a
strange
young
man
when
one
is
flat
on
one
ridiculous
back
with
no
personality
other
than
the
ugly
ignominious
one
of
pain
let
us
be
frank
diary
i
am
irritated
to
be
looked
upon
as
an
interesting
case
it
hurts
my
pride
it
wounds
my
vanity
it
affronts
me
this
is
not
a
pretty
confession
but
after
all
was
i
not
intended
for
other
uses
than
that
one
it
is
small
comfort
to
consider
that
my
history
is
tabulated
and
filed
in
many
an
imposing
medical
office
and
that
one
misguided
wretch
once
wrote
an
article
about
me
for
the
other
girls
have
pleasanter
publicity
to
look
back
upon
thrilling
of
clippings
from
local
papers
little
prosaic
bits
of
paper
that
despite
the
bored
phraseology
of
a
reporter
are
just
so
many
shining
feathers
from
the
wings
of
romance
they
run
something
like
this
miss
ella
smith
has
returned
to
college
miss
ella
smith
was
the
hostess
at
a
very
charming
dinner
dance
last
evening
in
her
residence
on
elm
avenue
this
affair
which
marked
the
debut
of
one
of
green
hill
most
popular
members
of
the
younger
set
was
etc
the
announcement
of
the
engagement
of
miss
ella
smith
to
howard
anderson
son
of
the
president
of
the
washington
park
bank
was
made
yesterday
at
a
luncheon
given
for
miss
ella
smith
by
arthur
jones
and
then
diary
after
half
a
column
for
the
wedding
and
the
voice
that
breathed
eden
accompaniment
perhaps
some
day
this
born
to
and
howard
anderson
née
ella
smith
a
son
howard
anderson
junior
and
after
that
of
course
the
my
mother
kept
one
of
me
absurd
pictures
are
in
it
a
lock
of
yellow
hair
and
all
sorts
of
dear
foolish
comments
even
my
first
word
is
written
there
with
i
know
a
vainglorious
pen
the
word
is
not
startling
it
is
birdie
father
has
often
told
me
that
mother
declared
this
initial
effort
of
speech
a
direct
sign
of
abnormal
brilliancy
on
my
part
as
the
dictionary
meaning
of
my
christian
name
is
european
song
thrush
or
throstle
i
wonder
if
even
a
throstle
would
not
get
out
of
tune
were
it
sentenced
to
captivity
i
am
terribly
restless
of
late
i
think
that
both
father
and
sarah
have
noticed
it
but
they
have
said
nothing
in
winter
i
lie
almost
dormant
but
spring
breeds
a
fever
in
my
blood
and
summer
sets
me
frantic
with
the
longing
to
be
up
and
out
and
away
but
of
all
the
hours
i
love
the
one
toward
twilight
before
sunset
when
the
light
is
long
and
level
and
a
mellow
golden
a
breeze
springs
up
and
whispers
gently
in
the
trees
and
i
come
nearest
of
all
then
to
a
sense
of
peace
and
quietude
this
hour
is
i
think
of
all
summer
hours
the
one
most
significant
of
her
in
winter
one
does
not
find
the
day
entering
imperceptibly
into
that
period
of
lovely
transition
in
winter
one
has
daylight
and
then
darkness
bedtime
diary
the
stars
are
thick
tonight
and
i
can
see
the
fireflies
on
the
grass
below
my
window
in
pretty
competition
with
the
high
still
light
in
the

have
been
cross

rebellious

forgive
me
it
only
in
books

if

do

down

the
alien

dear
little
mavis
of

i
know
richard

he
is
a
very
nice
person
to
know
and
he
will
be
more
than
glad
to
hear
from
you
i
am
sure
by
all
means
write
to
him
i
wish
i
were
and
a
poet
instead
of
and
a
publisher
however
i
shall
take
the
second
best
and
play
whenever
you
wish
i
will
further
your
schemes
and
preserve
your
incognito
you
designing
person
affectionately
john

july
from
a
bower
july
to
you
a
maker
of
songs
with
your
close
beside
me
and
a
picture
of
you
in
my
imagination
i
can
feel
little
hesitancy
in
writing
to
tell
you
as
best
i
can
all
that
your
poems
have
meant
to
me
i
am
briefly
a
in
whose
whole
limited
life
books
must
necessarily
play
a
greater
part
than
in
the
active
world
of
the
well
person
not
long
since
through
john
denton
your
verses
came
to
me
straight
into
my
hands
they
came
and
from
there
into
my
heart
they
are
singing
there
now
and
for
this
my
little
note
carries
you
real
gratitude
it
must
go
to
you
however
without
name
or
sign
i
rather
that
you
stayed
a
little
unreal
for
when
names
and
addresses
begin
to
play
their
part
then
convention
steps
in
to
lay
forbidding
hands
on
the
lips
of
friendly
impulse
even
here
in
my
castle
from
which
the
outside
world
is
almost
banished
and
which
i
shall
never
leave
thank
you
more
than
i
can
say
for
the
loveliness
of
your
songs
very
sincerely
yours
one
distant
reader
new
york
city
july
dear
i
have
your
letter
and
have
asked
our
mutual
friend
to
forward
my
reply
to
you
i
am
so
glad
that
you
did
not
allow
grundy
to
enter
that
bower
of
yours
which
sounds
so
attractive
i
am
sure
she
would
find
the
color
scheme
most
unbecoming
i
am
so
glad
that
you
care
for
my
book
it
is
my
first
and
i
have
a
weakness
for
it
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
sing
for
the
many
but
for
the
few
time
was
when
i
had
hoped
to
be
minstrel
for
all
the
world
but
that
is
past
now
and
i
am
content
with
what
i
do
if
it
can
call
forth
letters
like
yours
will
you
not
write
me
again
and
tell
me
as
much
of
yourself
as
you
care
to
or
am
i
asking
too
much
i
hope
not
for
your
letter
has
given
me
such
pleasure
it
has
made
a
little
happy
spot
for
me
along
the
way
an
oasis
in
that
desert
of
loneliness
which
all
of
us
know
so
well
it
is
hard
to
think
of
you
as
really
somehow
i
make
a
different
mental
picture
of
you
if
you
will
let
me
write
to
you
you
will
have
to
bear
with
me
tell
of
my
dreams
but
i
am
sure
you
could
not
treat
them
other
than
gently
and
perhaps
we
can
make
for
each
other
a
little
rendezvous
of
pen
and
ink
where
we
may
meet
and
talk
awhile
yours
very
gratefully
richard
warren
from
a
secluded
spot
july
dear
and
friendly
unknown
thank
you
for
your
letter
i
shall
be
glad
to
share
my
quiet
days
with
you
you
ask
me
about
myself
well
first
of
all
there
father
and
second
there
is
sarah
in
order
to
rightly
visualize
father
you
must
imagine
all
the
strength
and
gentleness
in
the
world
made
man
and
to
be
truly
aware
of
sarah
you
must
picture
an
aging
fairy
who
brings
you
just
what
you
want
on
trays
and
things
before
you
know
you
want
them
who
creeps
in
to
tuck
you
up
before
you
realize
you
are
about
to
grow
chilly
father
is
big
and
grey
and
brown
sarah
is
like
new
england
just
before
spring
very
reticent
and
most
tender
beneath
a
wintry
exterior
she
has
been
nurse
and
servant
mother
and
friend
to
me
since
that
day
when
after
the
doctors
had
agreed
that
there
was
no
open
door
through
which
i
might
escape
into
health
again
they
brought
me
back
here
to
live
out
the
rest
of
my
life
and
of
course
no
category
would
be
complete
without
a
mention
of
peter
who
is
quite
the
most
delightful
lover
that
ever
a
girl
could
have
then
there
our
cottage
a
small
red
edifice
rather
it
is
close
to
the
hills
i
think
that
they
care
for
it
in
so
friendly
a
manner
do
they
regard
its
very
windows
in
spring
it
is
very
intimate
with
the
apple
blossoms
which
toss
rosy
sprays
into
the
crystal
air
to
break
about
its
feet
in
summer
as
now
the
roses
pour
white
and
red
and
golden
wine
on
the
doorstep
in
autumn
the
gayest
leaves
come
drifting
by
to
settle
on
the
verandah
and
even
the
snow
seems
to
like
it
so
high
and
white
does
it
heap
itself
about
the
doors
inside
the
very
best
of
the
house
is
in
my
room
father
calls
it
the
heart
of
the
home
if
it
is
that
it
beats
in
grey
and
rose
and
lovely
old
blue
grey
in
the
walls
and
floor
and
rose
and
blue
in
the
cretonnes
of
curtains
and
mahogany
furniture
all
day
long
i
lie
in
a
bed
which
belonged
to
a
great
great
grandmamma
and
is
stationed
in
a
big
i
can
look
out
over
the
hills
which
in
fancy
i
am
always
climbing
many
people
come
to
see
me
here
they
bring
me
their
troubles
and
their
joys
and
i
suffer
and
am
glad
with
them
vicariously
one
by
one
you
shall
meet
them
as
our
correspondence
continues
for
indeed
i
hope
it
will
but
with
just
one
condition
never
by
hook
or
crook
or
dark
wiles
must
you
procure
my
name
from
our
postman
for
then
the
spell
will
break
and
i
will
vanish
like
the
apparitions
in
the
fairy
stories
that
blot
is
where
i
stopped
to
look
at
an
absurd
cow
which
wandered
slowly
across
my
line
of
vision
over
the
road
and
into
the
orchard
such
an
amusing
and
defiant
tail
so
melancholy
an
eye
it
has
been
raining
this
morning
and
now
there
is
palest
sunlight
through
veils
of
mist
somewhere
a
bird
is
being
very
happy
about
something
through
an
open
window
comes
the
fragrance
of
growing
things
surely
you
miss
half
of
life
i
hear
sarah
approaching
that
means
luncheon
so
i
must
leave
you
poet
this
is
such
a
charming
game
solitaire
with
an
unseen
partner
that
i
am
loath
to
lay
aside
the
cards
poet
good
afternoon
yours
loquaciously
me
new
york
city
july
enchanted
princess
your
letters
travel
so
long
a
route
to
reach
me
that
i
tremble
lest
sometime
they
should
grow
weary
and
stop
off
permanently
on
the
way
will
you
not
send
them
direct
to
the
yale
club
i
am
in
and
out
of
town
all
week
and
will
always
go
there
for
my
mail
i
of
course
shall
have
to
stick
to
the
white
mountain
itinerary
but
your
word
is
law
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
about
the
king
and
the
and
the
castle
yet
it
is
yourself
i
want
a
of
on
second
thoughts
perhaps
unconsciously
you
are
making
it
for
me
i
live
but
no
it
would
never
do
to
tell
you
i
shall
have
to
move
in
order
to
provide
a
poet
with
a
less
prosaic
setting
i
am
desolate
in
having
no
sarah
to
anticipate
my
wants
and
no
father
however
tucked
away
where
no
one
can
steal
her
from
me
i
possess
a
mother
a
mother
with
tiny
hands
and
feet
and
the
prettiest
red
hair
in
the
world
this
is
too
bewildering
a
shade
for
a
mother
hair
to
flaunt
she
has
added
charm
to
beauty
by
acquiring
somewhere
merry
blue
eyes
with
an
irish
twinkle
in
them
and
a
kindly
angel
has
set
these
jewels
deftly
in
the
sweetest
face
you
would
love
her
i
know
and
i
am
generously
willing
to
share
her
with
you
if
in
return
i
may
claim
a
bit
of
your
father
between
us
we
could
manage
to
own
a
perfectly
good
pair
of
parents
could
we
but
for
the
sake
of
my
peace
of
mind
will
you
translate
interpret
or
explain
peter
to
me
do
tell
me
about
your
visitors
do
they
come
to
see
you
i
beg
your
pardon
i
mean
do
gallant
knights
ever
gallop
up
to
the
drawbridge
on
chargers
and
blow
lustily
on
a
silver
trumpet
at
the
postern
gate
whatever
that
is
for
admission
and
does
a
certain
lady
ever
graciously
bid
her
varlets
give
them
entrance
tell
me
this
and
what
you
read
and
what
you
think
and
if
you
will
whisper
to
me
just
how
many
years
have
left
you
lovelier
than
the
year
before
i
will
confess
to
you
that
i
am
yours
richard
warren
the
castle
july
dear
merlin
he
was
an
aged
wizard
you
know
your
letter
has
been
here
for
several
days
but
i
have
not
been
very
well
now
i
and
the
answer
goes
to
you
first
of
all
you
may
indeed
have
a
small
interest
in
father
this
is
how
much
you
tempt
me
with
your
description
of
your
mother
will
you
give
her
my
love
mother
must
be
a
very
precious
person
mine
i
can
hardly
remember
but
i
know
she
was
sweet
and
good
and
beautiful
it
does
seem
possible
that
anyone
mother
could
be
anything
else
my
mother
was
very
young
when
she
died
and
although
the
lack
of
her
is
sometimes
very
hard
to
bear
i
am
grateful
always
that
her
eyes
closed
on
the
sight
of
me
sturdy
laughing
sound
not
as
i
am
now
a
bit
of
human
wreckage
i
wonder
if
she
knows
there
are
moments
before
dawn
when
i
seem
to
feel
her
lean
over
me
and
her
tears
are
on
my
face
but
i
know
that
god
is
merciful
and
because
of
this
i
think
the
dear
dead
may
not
see
us
else
how
were
it
heaven
is
it
very
hard
to
be
i
am
a
great
old
age
if
one
stops
to
consider
it
of
course
i
have
gentlemen
guests
i
am
not
too
old
for
that
there
father
every
day
and
occasionally
sammy
simpson
then
there
is
peter
who
lives
next
door
he
would
be
flattered
at
your
interest
peter
is
seven
and
the
proud
possessor
of
a
place
where
teeth
once
were
i
regret
to
state
that
he
employs
this
aperture
for
an
immortal
if
not
conventional
purpose
it
is
quite
easy
he
once
earnestly
confided
to
me
once
you
get
the
nick
of
it
peter
his
mother
and
his
baby
sister
are
away
on
a
visit
and
i
miss
my
little
friend
i
suppose
my
doctor
comes
under
the
category
of
male
visitor
he
is
sixty
very
crusty
but
human
and
dear
there
another
medical
person
too
but
he
does
count
for
a
little
merlin
yours
the
princess
new
york
city
july
your
royal
delightfulness
i
am
so
sorry
you
not
been
well
i
ca
bear
to
think
that
you
should
suffer
pain
what
plucky
creatures
women
are
i
wonder
that
they
are
created
from
the
same
clay
as
great
blundering
hulks
of
masculinity
when
my
letter
remained
so
long
unanswered
i
began
to
fear
that
it
had
never
experienced
the
joy
of
coming
to
you
i
began
to
worry
lest
i
had
offended
and
alienated
you
indeed
princess
i
began
to
think
all
manner
of
dreadful
things
this
must
never
happen
again
for
i
am
sure
i
have
a
crop
of
grey
hair
mind
now
your
visiting
list
is
interesting
sammy
simpson
i
approve
if
only
for
the
euphony
of
his
name
peter
and
your
grouchy
physician
have
charm
but
who
is
the
doctor
who
not
count
i
am
always
suspicious
of
a
man
when
a
girl
says
so
venomous
a
thing
about
him
do
tell
me
doctors
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
and
sometimes
i
think
we
songsters
try
to
doctor
too
just
a
bit
it
is
of
course
not
healing
of
broken
bones
of
wounds
and
fevers
that
we
try
to
bring
the
world
but
of
broken
hearts
and
the
wounds
of
every
day
of
fevers
of
too
much
earth
and
restlessness
i
do
not
suppose
we
can
hope
to
cure
but
perhaps
we
can
provide
occasionally
a
draught
which
drugs
for
a
little
into
forgetfulness
no
princess
i
do
not
think
that
the
dead
can
see
us
at
least
not
with
the
eyes
of
earth
but
they
watch
over
us
perhaps
with
a
clearer
sight
than
we
may
know
and
see
beyond
today
and
beyond
the
flesh
and
are
content
knowing
with
god
that
all
things
work
toward
eventual
good
now
that
we
have
brought
the
family
into
it
please
remember
me
admiringly
to
your
father
yours
richard
warren
the
castle
july
dear
minstrel
man
please
do
you
love
i
have
been
spending
such
a
pleasant
hour
with
her
peter
returned
from
his
travels
arrived
this
morning
with
my
breakfast
tray
and
your
letter
after
we
had
exhausted
the
raptures
of
welcome
and
peter
his
enunciation
somewhat
impaired
by
toast
had
told
me
all
there
is
to
know
about
perkins
perkins
and
the
boarder
he
demanded
a
so
as
my
own
inventive
faculties
seem
a
little
out
of
repair
i
took
him
with
me
a
willing
captive
to
the
rabbit
hole
and
beyond
yes
i
am
sure
you
love
poet
no
poet
could
be
entirely
i
wish
you
could
see
my
new
edition
of
the
house
where
she
lives
it
is
charming
and
came
to
me
from
our
last
night
i
saw
a
shooting
star
i
suppose
it
was
heralding
august
the
month
of
these
flying
flames
as
a
child
i
always
thought
that
the
angels
were
shoeing
the
horses
which
drew
the
chariot
of
the
sun
and
that
these
were
stray
sparks
from
the
heavenly
anvil
i
do
not
know
that
i
was
so
very
wrong
after
all
everything
beautiful
must
be
a
spark
of
the
plan
which
is
being
forged
in
that
divine
smithy
do
you
wish
on
shooting
stars
i
do
always
the
same
wish
all
my
life
i
played
at
just
such
silly
games
perhaps
we
all
of
us
do
in
different
ways
a
thousand
years
ago
when
a
certain
great
poet
was
a
child
did
ever
he
refrain
from
stepping
on
cracks
as
he
went
whistling
to
school
if
one
is
careful
you
know
and
reaches
one
destination
in
triumph
it
may
mean
much
a
new
absolution
for
a
tiny
sin
rice
pudding
for
supper
but
perhaps
you
were
never
naughty
i
am
sure
you
did
wear
and
but
this
is
hard
to
believe
possibly
you
do
like
rice
pudding
you
could
resist
sarah
i
am
sure
i
i
wish
on
hay
wagons
i
adore
odd
numbers
particularly
do
i
revel
in
thirteen
at
the
same
time
my
defiance
ends
there
i
can
not
spill
salt
without
a
shudder
and
first
stars
and
baby
moons
are
burdened
with
my
desires
i
am
sure
that
every
wish
would
come
true
and
the
veriest
pebble
turn
an
infallible
talisman
in
my
hand
if
only
i
believed
enough
there
a
sunset
behaving
riotously
outside
i
am
sure
that
it
appears
much
more
sedate
in
new
york
whimsically
yours
me
i
forgot
to
answer
your
questions
about
the
other
doctor
he
is
rather
tall
and
most
particularly
exasperating
new
york
city
august
dear
princess
if
denton
may
send
you
books
so
may
i
in
this
mail
three
friends
of
mine
go
to
you
romance
of
the
and
and
grahame
please
be
kind
to
them
i
rather
think
you
must
be
like
fiametta
a
slim
brown
child
with
oval
face
and
curious
hair
dark
as
the
in
the
hall
that
the
sunshine
burnished
into
brightness
i
dreamed
of
you
last
night
an
adventurous
dream
some
day
i
will
write
you
about
it
not
now
with
the
books
i
am
sending
you
a
talisman
i
hope
it
will
bring
you
all
you
wish
of
course
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
told
it
to
try
there
is
a
secret
hidden
at
its
heart
but
i
do
not
believe
that
you
can
find
it
out
all
by
yourself
that
would
take
a
poet
now
write
me
and
tell
me
how
egotistical
i
am
but
remember
after
all
i
am
nothing
more
or
less
than
mere
man
i
hope
you
will
care
for
your
added
charm
for
the
books
and
a
little
for
your
friend
richard
warren
new
york
city
august
dear
lady
have
i
in
any
way
offended
you
i
have
had
no
word
from
you
since
the
i
am
praying
that
you
are
not
angry
because
i
allowed
myself
the
selfish
pleasure
of
adding
to
your
library
or
is
it
the
talisman
i
hope
not
you
see
it
was
not
just
a
purchased
thing
it
belonged
to
my
father
but
i
would
far
rather
than
you
were
vexed
with
me
than
too
ill
to
write
anxiously
richard
warren
the
castle
august
how
very
rude
you
must
think
me
dear
friend
for
several
days
have
passed
and
i
have
not
yet
thanked
you
for
the
books
and
for
the
curiously
carven
piece
of
jade
which
you
assure
me
will
bring
me
my
heart
desire
it
lies
close
in
my
left
hand
as
i
write
i
like
the
cool
touch
of
it
and
what
a
beautiful
color
it
is
like
the
very
heart
of
summer
but
you
should
not
have
robbed
yourself
of
anything
so
precious
the
books
are
delightful
i
wonder
if
one
reads
one
self
into
every
book
your
choice
of
friends
is
faultless
i
have
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
paul
already
but
fiametta
and
i
are
not
alike
for
where
she
is
brown
i
am
white
and
where
her
face
is
oval
mine
is
pointed
and
where
her
hair
is
mine
is
just
and
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
am
no
longer
ten
except
perhaps
when
peter
urges
me
to
be
and
now
i
have
a
to
share
with
you
also
it
is
the
main
reason
why
i
have
not
let
you
hear
from
me
before
in
a
few
days
i
to
be
carried
downstairs
and
out
under
the
trees
where
an
ingenious
cot
awaits
my
occupancy
for
several
days
i
have
been
preparing
the
disagreeable
doctor
insists
and
father
and
our
own
medicine
man
aid
and
abet
him
there
been
a
large
scandinavian
lady
here
every
day
she
possesses
strong
hands
and
a
cloudy
accent
and
i
am
informed
that
she
is
to
be
the
witch
who
will
remove
certain
fetters
from
my
circulation
i
have
wished
on
my
talisman
that
she
may
be
successful
you
see
i
ca
be
very
sanguine
about
it
for
they
tried
all
manner
of
things
of
this
sort
long
ago
and
to
no
avail
but
o
poet
if
ever
i
get
out
under
the
trees
again
once
there
how
my
spirit
will
strain
at
the
leash
of
my
body
to
be
off
and
away
over
the
hills
i
not
told
you
before
of
our
plan
lest
it
not
come
true
what
did
you
dream
poet
and
will
you
not
tell
me
the
secret
gratefully
yours
an
impatient
invalid
paul
fiametta
alice
and
other
of
your
intimates
wish
to
be
affectionately
remembered
and
peter
wants
to
know
if
you
are
by
chance
a
scout
it
is
the
ambition
of
his
life
to
attain
the
age
of
twelve
and
his
modern
knighthood

your
letter
of
the
seventh
has
reached
me
it
must
have
crossed
mine
i
began
to
feel
happier
directly
i
had
written
so
i
must
have
known
that
you
were
writing
too
thank
you
for
absolving
me
your
news
is
good
news
indeed
but
i
must
know
who
is
to
have
the
joy
of
carrying
you
out
into
the
sunshine
which
is
your
birthright
the
old
unpleasant
doctor
the
young
and
even
more
unpleasant
doctor
i
think
perhaps
you
had
better
arrange
to
have
your
father
play
magician
i
have
had
a
letter
from
my
mother
there
a
message
for
you
in
it
obediently
i
quote
please
tell
the
unknown
lady
that
i
have
received
her
love
and
am
taking
care
of
it
i
wish
i
could
run
in
to
visit
with
her
in
that
room
but
it
would
do
at
all
not
with
my
hair
tell
her
she
must
have
it
done
over
in
blues
and
browns
before
i
can
put
in
an
appearance
the
years
thank
god
whatever
else
they
take
still
leave
me
my
vanity
give
the
princess
my
love
and
ask
her
if
bedsocks
would
become
her
feet
size
too
please
there
more
to
it
only
if
i
should
quote
further
you
grow
aware
how
much
i
have
written
her
about
you
and
just
what
i
have
said
and
that
would
never
do
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
well
brought
up
i
am
confiding
in
my
maternal
parent
did
you
know
the
verses
were
dedicated
to
her
no
i
will
not
tell
you
my
dream
nor
what
the
talisman
is
hiding
from
you
if
i
did
you
would
lose
all
interest
for
i
should
no
longer
be
a
man
of
mystery
will
you
tell
an
egotistical
male
just
which
verse
most
pleases
you
and
of
course
you
will
let
me
hear
directly
you
leave
the
castle
yours
richard
warren
please
congratulate
peter
for
me
on
his
aspirations

him
that
although
hoary
beyond
belief
i
too
have
always
yearned
to
be
a
scout

good
one

how
dare
you
have
secrets
is
that
not
woman
prerogative
i
will
not
answer
any
of
your
questions
today
nor
indeed
write
to
you
at
all
instead
i
will
write
to
your
mother
yours
indifferently
her
royal
haughtiness
enclosure
dear
mother
of
the
poet
your
son
has
written
me
your
message
it
is
lovely
of
you
to
understand
and
you
understand
do
you
not
just
how
much
this
pleasant
friendship
means
to
me
in
my
restricted
world
bound
as
it
is
by
walls
north
and
south
east
and
west
the
bedsocks
sound
beautiful
i
have
some
severe
gray
ones
which
always
make
me
feel
very
plain
but
sarah
who
fashioned
them
has
little
imagination
it
is
dear
of
you
to
want
to
knit
for
me
and
when
the
cold
nights
come
i
shall
welcome
your
gift
about
size
three
i
should
say
warren
writes
me
that
lyric
is
dedicated
to
you
i
have
turned
to
the
page
and
read
it
with
new
eyes
to
the
dearest
of
all
and
i
am
sure
that
the
poem
which
is
my
favorite
is
your
own
it
is
the
one
which
begins
for
this
the
patience
of
your
love
the
pride
which
gives
me
wings
dearest
my
gratitude
if
only
i
could
say
it
in
verse
what
a
thankful
little
poem
would
go
to
you
now
but
i
can
only
sign
myself
very
much
your
debtor
new
york
city
august
cruel
princess
my
head
is
in
the
dust
such
an
uncomfortable
place
for
it
too
reluctantly
i
have
forwarded
to
my
mother
the
letter
which
should
have
been
mine
i
have
read
it
every
word
surely
that
snippy
little
note
in
which
you
call
me
me
a
perfect
stranger
names
can
not
be
considered
a
real
letter
on
second
thoughts
the
wildest
flight
of
fancy
could
never
claim
that
your
enclosure
was
intended
for
me
however
if
i
can
not
knit
i
can
write
poems
for
you
there
are
some
on
my
desk
now
but
i
will
not
send
them
to
you
yet
they
are
very
shy
how
is
peter
yours
despondently
richard
warren
what
little
feet
you
have
august
do
i
not
write
you
from
an
incredible
address
my
friend
yesterday
the
event
took
place
it
was
my
red
letter
day
illuminated
with
gold
early
in
the
afternoon
i
was
carried
out
of
the
house
with
comparatively
little
discomfort
on
a
most
ingenious
stretcher
by
father
and
the
very
young
doctor
my
dear
old
medicine
man
was
erect
in
the
vanguard
sternly
repressing
his
excitement
while
sarah
visibly
jarred
out
of
her
usual
self
brought
up
the
rear
in
a
flutter
of
apron
strings
and
ejaculated
warnings
we
must
have
made
an
imposing
procession
as
long
as
i
live
and
i
am
beginning
to
hope
that
it
will
be
for
half
a
century
or
more
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
sense
after
eleven
years
of
being
out
in
the
open
oh
i
had
my
windows
wide
to
the
four
winds
of
course
and
sunlight
across
my
counterpane
and
pillows
but
how
could
that
be
the
same
i
would
have
written
you
but
only
one
hour
of
freedom
was
granted
me
the
family
and
the
medical
profession
had
rigged
and
ready
for
me
between
the
two
biggest
most
friendly
trees
on
the
lawn
a
comfy
and
substantial
hammock
and
so
for
that
hour
i
lay
and
looked
and
looked
over
the
hills
and
across
the
valleys
and
right
into
our
own
garden
which
riots
in
bloom
these
august
days
i
must
confess
that
the
disagreeable
and
youthful
doctor
is
an
understanding
person
after
the
first
fifteen
minutes
had
passed
in
handshaking
and
congratulations
and
solicitude
he
marshalled
my
companions
and
led
them
away
leaving
me
alone
in
that
heavenly
air
with
the
green
trees
singing
all
about
me
i
shall
always
feel
more
kindly
toward
him
for
that
strategic
move
but
however
did
the
creature
know
that
even
dear
father
was
a
little
superfluous
will
you
tell
your
little
mother
of
my
good
fortune
i
know
you
both
will
be
glad
for
me
but
i
ca
believe
anyone
can
quite
grasp
my
happiness
and
my
gratitude
except
perhaps
a
life
prisoner
who
goes
unexpectedly
free
by
the
way
i
had
hardly
been
reluctantly
settled
in
the
house
again
before
father
rushed
out
and
wired
that
amiable
our
mutual
friend
john
denton
he
is
back
in
new
york
again
as
no
doubt
you
know
and
a
return
message
came
from
him
today
announcing
that
he
will
be
with
us
in
person
on
friday
in
order
to
celebrate
and
to
see
the
miracle
with
his
own
eyes
is
that
nice
and
wo
your
ears
burn
distant
poet
this
is
monday
monday
by
friday
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
spend
the
whole
afternoon
in
my
green
playground
your
friend
and
so
happily
the
princess
new
york
august
princess
your
letter
is
here
and
so
elated
me
that
i
put
a
black
cover
over
my
chattering
typewriter
it
like
a
parrot
you
know
and
i
must
occasionally
convince
it
by
artificial
means
that
it
is
night
and
left
my
cave
dwelling
for
the
day
in
order
to
fully
share
your
holiday
sense
and
when
i
returned
it
was
not
alone
for
what
do
you
think
right
in
the
wilds
of
manhattan
i
found
somebody
who
fairly
begged
to
be
sent
to
you
he
goes
to
you
by
john
denton
and
by
the
time
this
reaches
you
i
hope
he
will
feel
himself
very
much
at
home
and
i
hope
too
that
you
will
care
for
his
companionship
his
name
is
appropriately
wigglesworth
please
report
to
me
on
his
arrival
and
subsequent
behavior

i
out
of
doors
august
diary
you
not
to
scold
i
know
i
not
honored
you
with
so
much
as
an
exclamation
point
since
my
very
first
entry
but
john
denton
has
been
and
gone
and
wigglesworth
is
here
to
stay
let
me
see
how
it
all
happened
friday
last
at
exactly
three
sarah
arrayed
me
as
a
lily
of
the
field
in
a
glorified
turquoise
and
mauve
negligée
there
were
even
pompomed
slippers
on
my
worthless
feet
and
my
newly
washed
hair
was
piled
high
and
transfixed
with
my
spanish
comb
it
was
thus
festively
garbed
that
father
and
doctor
bill
by
which
name
he
shall
henceforth
be
known
as
some
slight
concession
to
his
wizardry
settled
me
happily
under
my
particular
trees
there
to
await
denton
arrival
sarah
at
my
insistence
smuggled
a
mirror
into
my
hand
and
sleeve
and
when
i
heard
the
smooth
purr
of
the
denton
motor
far
up
the
road
i
took
one
little
peek
for
if
i
am
not
allowed
to
be
just
an
atom
vain
what
virtue
is
there
in
charming
color
schemes
and
frothing
chiffons
certainly
the
negligée
is
distractingly
pretty
and
i
am
proud
of
father
dress
instinct
and
something
or
other
had
brought
the
faintest
tinge
of
color
to
my
cheeks
the
shadow
of
a
sparkle
to
my
eyes
i
was
hoping
that
no
one
would
detect
me
as
i
lay
and
admired
myself
but
the
doctor
bill
person
did
of
course
he
has
eyes
all
over
his
head
that
man
and
promptly
he
settled
a
lovely
rainbow
cushion
behind
my
head
remarking
very
quietly
perhaps
this
will
heighten
the
effect
miss
carroll
poor
uncle
john
i
could
have
killed
him
as
it
was
diary
although
i
almost
blush
to
confess
it
i
well
as
his
disgustingly
capable
hand
slid
past
my
cheek
i
turned
my
head
ever
so
little
and
quite
delicately
i
not
hard
but
in
an
extremely
ladylike
manner
there
was
no
occasion
for
his
rude
exclamation
and
the
alarming
which
he
proceeded
to
turn
happily
for
us
both
for
i
was
torn
between
insincere
apology
and
laughter
denton
arrived
engrossing
his
nephew
attention
and
my
own
as
usual
he
was
accompanied
by
half
a
dozen
baskets
of
fruit
and
half
a
library
shelf
of
the
latest
lightest
books
best
of
all
he
brought
his
own
rotund
self
and
wigglesworth
i
was
prepared
for
something
by
richard
warren
letter
which
had
come
to
me
friday
morning
but
not
for
this
delicious
bunch
of
french
bull
puppy
for
wigglesworth
is
the
acme
the
ultimate
perfection
of
dogdom
when
accompanied
by
gasps
from
all
assembled
he
leaped
at
me
out
of
the
chauffeur
restraining
arms
i
gave
a
perfectly
healthy
shriek
and
clutched
him
chiffons
notwithstanding
where
did
you
get
him
denton
asked
father
vainly
endeavoring
to
part
us
i
did
get
him
answered
denton
smiling
he
was
wished
on
me
by
an
unknown
admirer
of
mavis
father
extricated
wigglesworth
and
holding
him
firmly
he
has
been
well
named
read
aloud
from
the
silver
and
leather
collar
which
adorned
his
fascinating
neck
wigglesworth
then
looking
closer
added
what
this
of
i
am
afraid
i
looked
guilty
denton
whistled
and
stepped
nearer
the
initials
in
question
or
shall
i
say
the
questionable
initials
i
was
annoyed
to
see
in
how
friendly
a
spirit
wigglesworth
received
the
condescending
medical
hand
upon
his
quivering
ears
father
is
anything
but
slow
and
i
have
long
since
let
him
into
the
secret
of
my
romantic
correspondence
so
that
it
he
began
and
heaven
alone
knows
what
he
might
have
added
had
i
not
held
up
an
imploring
hand
father
subsided
but
i
did
quite
like
the
little
crease
between
his
brows
it
was
denton
bless
him
who
saved
the
situation
take
me
up
to
the
house
carroll
he
said
i
have
half
an
acre
of
connecticut
soil
on
my
person
and
off
they
went
arm
in
arm
with
denton
casting
a
reassuring
look
at
me
over
his
shoulder
alone
with
bill
and
the
frantic
wigglesworth
well
i
said
is
he
wonderful
who
asked
the
obtuse
creature
i
pointed
to
the
puppy
chasing
his
tail
with
verve
very
he
answered
drily
do
you
realize
miss
carroll
that
you
almost
sat
up
when
i
shouted
very
rudely
and
quite
disbelieving
about
five
minutes
ago
when
the
dog
jumped
into
your
hammock
but
i
insisted
childishly
i
have
been
able
to
sit
up
all
by
myself
since
i
know
he
interrupted
it
what
you
done
not
what
you
have
that
is
the
point
try
again
half
crying
from
excitement
i
tried
but
it
was
no
use
and
i
sank
back
helpless
and
hysterical
you
see
i
said
sorrowfully
yes
he
was
looking
at
me
out
of
those
eyes
we
not
going
to
give
up
he
said
but
now
you
must
be
taken
back
into
the
house
again
you
tired
and
no
amount
of
pleading
or
denial
could
bend
his
inflexible
will
wigglesworth
came
prancing
into
my
room
just
as
the
doctor
was
leaving
you
have
said
how
adorable
he
is
i
said
coaxing
my
new
toy
to
the
bed
adorable
he
repeated
emphatically
but
the
doctor
was
looking
at
the
quite
at
home
august
dear
poet
by
now
denton
has
brought
you
my
incoherent
note
of
thanks
for
the
benison
of
wigglesworth
every
day
i
thank
you
more
he
is
the
dearest
little
friend
one
could
imagine
or
wish
for
i
have
taught
him
to
bark
loudly
when
i
say
your
name
and
i
hope
to
bring
him
to
an
appreciation
of
poetry
by
selected
readings
next
week
sometime
i
am
to
have
my
promised
lawn
fete
to
introduce
the
countryside
to
the
new
member
of
our
household
even
sarah
has
succumbed
i
heard
her
talking
something
suspiciously
like
to
him
this
morning
when
she
came
in
with
my
tray
and
observed
wiggles
regarding
her
brightly
and
wagging
all
over
from
his
basket
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
and
father
is
a
willing
captive
of
his
charms
even
luring
him
from
me
on
long
companionable
walks
but
i
believe
that
he
is
jealous
of
you
because
he
has
never
thought
of
getting
me
a
dog
i
have
had
birds
and
goldfish
and
even
an
angora
kitten
which
lived
but
to
run
away
but
never
since
childhood
a
real
live
dog
of
my
own
denton
must
have
worked
some
magic
with
father
that
he
has
so
inexplicably
allowed
me
to
accept
so
valuable
a
gift
from
a
stranger
but
no
i
can
not
call
you
that
i
regret
to
report
that
wigglesworth
has
conceived
an
adoration
for
the
doctor
the
one
of
no
consequence
i
mean
i
can
not
understand
it
but
there
seems
to
be
a
natural
affinity
between
the
two
later
i
must
write
you
all
the
things
or
anyway
almost
all
which
denton
said
about
you
for
of
course
we
had
a
little
session
behind
closed
doors
and
i
asked
the
poor
man
questions
until
his
grey
head
rang
are
you
curious
but
before
i
repeat
to
you
what
was
of
course
told
to
me
in
strictest
confidence
i
must
ask
you
those
things
are
wigglesworth
sends
his
love
he
is
beside
my
bed
this
minute
on
the
floor
holding
up
one
paw
in
greeting
very
gratefully
yours
wigglesworth
slave
green
hill
september
dear
diary
i
sorry
that
i
neglect
you
so
but
you
see
with
friends
calling
every
day
to
behold
me
royally
at
home
out
of
doors
and
with
a
week
preparation
for
my
come
one
come
all
tea
which
took
place
yesterday
afternoon
and
with
almost
daily
letters
from
richard
warren
to
answer
i
so
many
now
that
they
make
far
too
bulky
a
book
of
you
and
so
i
have
them
tied
up
with
ribbon
under
my
pillow
and
with
peter
recent
heroic
attempt
to
drink
gasoline
and
wigglesworth
brilliant
development
as
a
bloodhound
well
i
have
had
but
little
time
for
you
blue
book
today
father
is
out
and
sarah
busy
below
stairs
it
is
five
of
a
golden
september
afternoon
and
i
am
alone
and
ready
to
record
the
events
of
the
past
week
suppose
we
begin
with
peter
who
lives
next
door
as
you
very
well
know
and
who
is
an
active
and
ambitious
and
altogether
charming
old
it
seems
diary
that
peter
has
during
the
summer
become
hopelessly
enamored
of
jimmy
simpson
the
old
brother
of
sammy
a
feckless
towhead
tanned
as
a
saddle
and
twice
as
tough
from
my
windows
and
more
recently
also
from
the
nearer
vantage
point
of
my
hammock
i
have
observed
the
progress
of
their
friendship
dating
from
the
early
days
of
summer
when
jimmy
condescended
to
aid
his
older
brother
in
the
morning
delivery
of
the
simpson
milk
lately
jimmy
has
been
seen
displaying
his
ragged
blue
overalls
about
the
lawn
adjoining
ours
i
have
heard
too
shrieks
and
dire
groans
which
i
take
to
portend
that
peter
has
more
than
once
inveigled
jimmy
into
his
own
favorite
and
histrionic
pastime
of
injuns
and
tigers
once
jimmy
in
his
role
of
scalper
became
slightly
too
realistic
and
peter
bursting
through
the
hedge
which
separates
the
goodrich
property
from
ours
fled
to
me
for
protection
with
his
curly
head
on
my
breast
i
turned
against
the
aggressor
jimmy
simpson
i
cried
indignantly
are
you
ashamed
to
frighten
a
boy
younger
than
yourself
do
you
know
that
is
manly
jimmy
engaging
brazen
and
stubbed
one
bare
toe
against
the
grass
honest
miss
mavis
he
defended
himself
firmly
i
did
hurt
him
none
he
a
he
is
he
concluded
with
a
positively
vicious
glance
at
the
back
of
peter
head
i
not
shouted
the
accused
rising
up
in
honest
wrath
repeated
jimmy
baby
an
telltale
here
peter
to
my
infinite
delight
squared
two
small
brown
fists
and
disengaging
himself
from
my
restraining
hands
advanced
belligerently
upon
his
idol
you
jimmy
said
peter
you
take
that
back
quick
i
swear
i
saw
a
gleam
of
admiration
in
the
simpson
eye
yes
i
begged
hastily
do
take
it
back
jimmy
jimmy
shifted
uneasily
upon
his
capacious
feet
well
he
began
uncertainly
and
then
a
wholly
friendly
smile
irradiated
his
freckled
face
i
was
only
funning
peter
he
said
generously
i
breathed
again
peter
dropped
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
said
happily
got
any
cookies
for
us
mavis
i
rang
my
silver
bell
for
sarah
and
presently
she
appeared
from
the
kitchen
greeted
jimmy
in
none
too
friendly
accents
and
disappearing
into
her
domain
returned
again
with
a
heaped
plate
of
crisp
tan
cookies
and
three
glasses
of
lemonade
there
said
sarah
grudgingly
you
young
limbs
she
looked
at
my
two
small
friends
as
she
spoke
but
i
am
afraid
she
included
me
in
her
remark
this
incident
served
to
show
jimmy
the
mettle
of
my
seven
year
old
neighbor
it
was
by
way
of
a
delicate
tribute
to
peter
that
he
was
asked
on
the
following
day
to
be
one
of
six
competitors
in
a
foot
race
which
starting
from
his
own
gate
was
to
end
at
the
cross
roads
some
five
hundred
yards
distant
just
before
the
start
he
came
over
and
exhibited
himself
to
me
clad
in
vest
and
drawers
with
sneakers
on
his
little
feet
and
a
huge
red
decorating
his
visibly
inflated
chest
solemnly
i
shook
his
hand
and
wished
him
well
then
i
lay
back
in
my
hammock
to
await
the
result
of
the
race
half
an
hour
later
peter
very
red
in
the
face
very
hot
and
manfully
trying
to
suppress
his
tears
appeared
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
with
jimmy
in
close
attendance
he
won
said
peter
disconsolately
pointing
a
dusty
forefinger
at
his
companion
but
pete
came
in
second
hastily
put
in
the
victor
standing
at
the
foot
of
my
swinging
couch
i
i
wanted
to
win
announced
peter
the
uncomforted
then
seeing
my
eyes
fixed
in
affection
and
condolence
on
him
he
gave
one
loud
frantic
gulp
and
came
into
my
arms
but
peter
darling
i
said
to
the
one
small
red
ear
i
could
see
you
must
remember
that
you
are
only
seven
if
you
big
for
your
age
and
all
the
other
boys
are
much
older
are
they
jimmy
i
asked
this
with
my
most
appealing
look
over
peter
bowed
head
toward
the
simpson
scion
yes
miss
mavis
corroborated
jimmie
loudly
an
pete
he
done
awful
good
to
come
in
second
why
josh
watkins
was
in
the
race
too
and
he
eleven
an
a
terrible
swift
runner
you
see
i
said
to
the
ear
peter
raised
his
head
and
thrust
his
grimy
fists
into
his
eyes
it
all
right
he
said
bravely
only
never
mind
dear
i
begged
next
time
you
come
in
first
he
jimmy
sure
agreed
jimmy
heartily
and
peter
content
with
the
confidence
of
his
vanquisher
presently
made
off
with
him
saying
earnestly
but
jimmy
what
makes
you
go
so
fast
two
days
later
swinging
lazily
between
my
trees
and
reading
lyric
to
wiggles
who
listened
attentively
and
with
cocked
inquiring
ears
i
was
horrified
to
see
goodrich
hurtle
herself
through
the
hedge
followed
by
loretta
her
black
cook
both
of
them
wringing
their
hands
loretta
i
swear
almost
as
white
as
her
mistress
and
both
demanding
you
seen
peter
why
no
i
answered
not
today
why
sarah
her
sixth
sense
telling
her
that
something
was
wrong
appeared
simultaneously
at
the
foot
of
my
hammock
oh
mavis
said
peter
pretty
mother
he
lost
he
been
gone
two
hours
and
we
been
everywhere
loretta
her
apron
over
her
kinky
head
rocked
to
and
fro
i
looked
at
sarah
have
you
seen
him
i
asked
my
heart
standing
very
still
no
miss
mavis
except
for
the
sound
of
loretta
noisy
weeping
we
were
quite
quiet
black
pond
said
goodrich
in
a
whisper
do
said
sarah
and
i
together
for
the
black
pond
diary
up
the
road
is
a
wicked
sheet
of
water
depthless
and
sinister
i
have
never
cursed
my
helplessness
as
i
did
then
perhaps
jimmy
simpson
i
began
but
goodrich
interrupted
me
loretta
has
been
to
the
simpsons
mavis
jimmy
is
off
with
sammy
somewhere
no
one
has
seen
or
heard
of
peter
since
this
morning
and
we
have
not
seen
him
since
luncheon
where
father
i
asked
looking
at
sarah
somewhere
with
doctor
denton
she
answered
and
as
she
did
so
a
gay
whistle
reached
me
from
the
direction
of
our
gate
perhaps
that
father
now
i
said
hopefully
but
it
was
only
doctor
bill
hatless
coatless
swinging
up
the
path
and
cutting
across
to
us
miss
carroll
he
said
smiling
your
father
asked
me
to
tell
you
and
then
why
what
the
matter
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
it
was
sarah
who
answered
it
peter
doctor
he
lost
lost
nonsense
he
could
get
lost
here
every
one
in
green
hill
knows
the
little
chap
where
have
you
looked
he
asked
goodrich
everywhere
and
telephoned
every
house
for
miles
his
father
is
in
town
you
know
oh
she
broke
off
incoherently
i
can
never
forgive
myself
my
baby
the
doctor
hand
was
on
her
quieting
soothing
must
break
down
goodrich
suppose
you
sit
here
for
a
bit
with
miss
carroll
and
get
your
breath
we
find
the
boy
wo
we
wiggles
the
dog
jumped
at
the
sound
of
his
name
in
the
beloved
voice
and
began
chasing
his
tail
in
an
ecstasy
of
showing
off
denton
beckoned
sarah
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
and
i
heard
her
answer
yes
sir
before
she
left
the
group
and
went
toward
the
house
taking
loretta
with
her
who
saw
him
last
asked
the
doctor
cheerfully
sitting
down
with
wiggles
on
his
knee
michel
our
chauffeur
peter
was
with
him
in
the
barn
right
after
lunch
and
where
is
michel
now
he
went
with
several
of
the
men
on
the
place
to
search
said
goodrich
i
think
they
did
tell
me
but
i
think
they
mean
to
drag
the
pond
she
went
to
pieces
there
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
for
sarah
appeared
again
with
a
glass
of
something
benton
took
it
from
her
drink
this
he
said
quietly
his
hand
on
goodrich
shoulder
watching
him
i
suddenly
knew
that
it
would
be
all
right
that
peter
was
not
really
lost
but
only
mislaid
that
we
would
all
be
spared
a
cruel
and
terrible
sorrow
he
seemed
to
read
my
mind
for
he
nodded
at
me
and
said
smiling
that
better
miss
carroll
sometimes
i
think
that
the
man
is
really
a
magician
it
was
perhaps
ten
minutes
later
that
michel
appeared
through
the
hedge
goodrich
rather
dangerously
calm
i
thought
got
to
her
feet
well
she
breathed
the
chauffeur
shook
his
head
no
trace
the
boys
are
still
looking
the
black
pond
she
asked
in
a
whisper
one
hand
at
her
throat
they
down
there
now
ah
she
was
at
denton
side
now
her
hands
on
his
arm
please
help
us
her
eyes
sought
his
i
going
to
do
my
best
he
answered
michel
did
peter
say
anything
to
you
in
the
barn
about
going
out
to
play
the
irishman
face
corrugated
in
an
effort
to
remember
no
doctor
sor
not
that
i
mind
he
came
out
the
lad
to
ask
me
what
makes
cars
go
fast
what
it
was
i
who
spoke
the
foot
race
of
two
days
before
flashed
suddenly
into
my
mind
and
the
last
thing
i
had
heard
peter
say
but
jimmy
what
makes
you
go
so
fast
what
did
you
tell
him
i
asked
eagerly
well
michel
scratched
his
red
head
i
told
him
the
gasoline
miss
mavis
just
to
keep
him
quiet
in
a
word
i
told
the
others
about
the
race
and
peter
disappointment
you
do
suppose
i
finished
hesitating
that
he
tried
to
drink
gasoline
concluded
benton
thoughtfully
we
all
looked
at
michel
well
he
said
slowly
seems
to
me
that
i
did
see
him
foolin
around
the
tank
but
i
was
busy
and
when
i
looked
up
again
he
was
gone
i
seen
him
runnin
interposed
loretta
suddenly
runnin
down
toward
the
gate
i
remember
now
gasoline
said
peter
mother
pitifully
would
would
it
him
doctor
the
doctor
laughed
outright
not
by
a
long
shot
he
answered
cheerfully
and
if
he
did
take
a
drink
of
it
i
wager
it
was
a
very
long
drink
now
goodrich
you
and
loretta
go
home
and
get
some
water
heated
and
fetch
out
a
pot
of
mustard
i
off
with
wiggles
to
find
the
young
athlete
and
that
all
diary
except
that
they
did
find
him
it
was
wiggles
really
who
discovered
him
in
a
deserted
barn
half
a
mile
up
the
road
sleeping
peacefully
and
smelling
to
high
heaven
of
the
gas
home
they
brought
him
and
it
must
go
on
record
that
though
mustard
and
warm
water
had
no
effect
whatsoever
upon
that
cast
iron
little
stomach
every
time
peter
coughed
denton
swears
that
the
gasoline
fumes
nearly
knocked
him
over
did
you
really
drink
it
sweetheart
asked
his
mother
just
before
she
tucked
him
in
bed
course
answered
peter
mike
said
it
made
the
cars
go
fast
so
i
tried
it
i
did
like
it
much
he
confessed
but
golly
how
i
ran
i
wish
jimmy
could
have
seen
me
and
on
that
peter
fell
asleep
diary
i
am
nearly
asleep
too
wo
sarah
scold
if
she
catches
me
so
i
will
postpone
till
tomorrow
my
account
of
the
lawn
tea
and
the
utterly
new
man
imminent
in
our
midst
now
are
you
curious
chapter
v
the
very
next
day
i
was
so
tired
last
night
diary
that
i
could
sleep
and
sarah
blames
you
she
has
just
said
sternly
no
more
writing
miss
mavis
and
vanished
from
the
room
out
you
come
from
under
my
pillow
in
lawless
defiance
of
the
mandate
for
it
raining
and
dull
and
i
ca
go
out
of
doors
and
so
i
must
have
something
to
occupy
me
must
i
not
but
is
it
perfectly
wonderful
that
the
rain
should
deprive
me
of
something
for
it
was
only
a
very
short
time
ago
that
rain
or
sunshine
meant
very
little
to
me
aside
from
aesthetic
pleasure
and
shut
or
open
windows
as
the
case
might
be
now
for
a
description
of
the
lawn
fete
it
was
an
early
affair
three
to
be
exact
and
very
young
september
put
on
her
very
gayest
appearance
for
me
father
and
sarah
bill
and
mac
constituted
themselves
a
committee
on
decoration
and
refreshments
and
as
a
consequence
we
had
a
lawn
gay
with
wicker
chairs
hammocks
cushions
tables
flags
and
flowers
and
a
very
important
table
loaded
with
sandwiches
tiny
cakes
bonbons
and
all
manner
of
cool
drinkables
and
then
came
the
crowds
i
do
believe
everyone
in
green
hill
turned
out
from
sammy
and
his
i
wonder
what
happened
to
the
messages
during
that
afternoon
never
mind
no
one
would
have
been
home
to
receive
them
to
peter
and
his
small
friends
and
old
granny
wallace
who
drove
up
in
a
dilapidated
buggy
and
wore
a
new
black
bonnet
for
the
occasion
i
wore
and
this
will
interest
you
the
mauve
and
turquoise
negligée
with
various
additions
one
was
a
bunch
of
the
loveliest
glowingest
orchids
you
have
ever
seen
which
was
brought
to
me
by
john
denton
who
made
a
flying
return
trip
for
the
express
purpose
he
said
of
kissing
my
hands
and
delivering
the
flowers
which
he
assured
me
came
from
the
donor
of
wiggles
a
card
with
the
orchids
read
to
match
a
delightful
costume
so
denton
the
villain
has
been
talking
under
my
laces
i
wore
richard
jade
and
in
honor
of
the
occasion
i
decorated
wiggles
much
to
his
disgust
with
a
huge
purple
bow
it
was
very
becoming
to
his
lively
and
brunette
beauty
as
all
who
saw
him
will
attest
it
was
a
dear
afternoon
everyone
was
so
happy
for
me
they
fairly
overwhelmed
me
with
good
wishes
and
affectionate
optimistic
prophecies
my
two
medicos
kept
a
very
stern
guard
over
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
get
rid
of
one
or
the
other
for
more
than
a
moment
at
a
time
but
i
had
mac
in
a
perfectly
beautiful
rage
by
accusing
him
of
trying
to
steal
the
scandinavian
heart
of
hildeborg
my
massive
masseuse
oh
yes
she
was
there
too
marvellously
gotten
up
her
yellow
head
very
much
in
the
foreground
and
her
big
voice
booming
out
at
the
most
inopportune
moments
in
more
than
the
most
inopportune
remarks
thereby
greatly
endangering
the
preservation
of
gravity
in
those
present
her
public
advice
to
mac
along
lines
of
reduction
was
extremely
exhilarating
we
had
music
rendered
slightly
off
key
but
with
all
the
good
will
in
the
world
by
the
green
hill
musical
four
consisting
of
a
simpson
a
watkins
and
the
jones
twins
who
performed
respectively
upon
a
cornet
a
violin
a
banjo
and
a
it
was
diary
the
very
last
word
in
successful
parties
only
one
thing
occurred
to
cast
any
shadow
over
a
wonderful
day
and
of
all
people
selected
by
an
unkind
fate
to
sully
my
happiness
it
was
peter
who
to
mix
metaphors
somewhat
cast
the
first
stone
in
the
presence
of
at
least
six
villagers
including
granny
wallace
the
town
gossip
he
regarded
my
frivolity
of
a
lace
and
ribbon
cap
and
asked
as
solemnly
as
a
mouth
full
to
capacity
with
cake
would
permit
mavis
do
you
set
your
cap
how
do
i
what
i
asked
in
all
innocence
one
hand
to
my
headgear
set
it
he
repeated
sally
says
that
adeline
says
that
you
are
setting
your
cap
for
doctor
denton
adeline
diary
is
sally
sister
and
denton
cook
several
in
the
group
about
me
laughed
and
granny
wallace
ears
grew
visibly
in
length
i
ca
imagine
what
you
mean
peterkins
i
answered
with
carelessness
and
turned
to
talk
volubly
with
goodrich
who
was
adding
to
the
gaiety
by
saying
audibly
hush
peter
but
peter
was
not
to
be
silenced
sally
says
he
protested
in
his
clear
little
voice
that
adeline
says
she
told
doctor
denton
about
it
your
cap
you
know
and
that
he
laughed
out
loud
and
said
you
could
for
all
of
him
what
that
about
doctor
denton
asked
that
individual
suddenly
coming
up
quietly
behind
the
group
talk
about
bombshells
despite
goodrich
frantic
attempt
to
hush
her
young
hopeful
peter
his
hand
in
doctor
denton
obligingly
repeated
his
story
an
he
concluded
turning
to
me
wistfully
please
mavis
you
set
it
for
me
i
like
to
see
how
you
do
it
amid
an
awestruck
silence
doctor
denton
swung
peter
who
squealed
with
delight
up
and
up
to
his
broad
shoulder
and
said
laughing
but
a
little
red
nonsense
old
chap
miss
carroll
wo
set
her
cap
for
you
for
well
about
twenty
years
more
or
less
but
is
it
a
pretty
cap
with
a
wicked
laugh
he
turned
and
strode
off
peter
clinging
to
his
shock
of
dark
hair
and
asking
very
loudly
but
does
she
do
it
like
hens
do
doctor
uncle
i
have
the
remotest
idea
what
happened
after
that
i
vaguely
remember
granny
wallace
hurrying
and
cackling
off
and
the
other
members
of
the
group
trying
to
compose
their
features
and
to
their
conversation
that
goodrich
before
she
left
bent
over
me
and
whispered
mavis
dear
i
sorry
helped
matters
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
not
one
whit
by
the
same
evening
i
am
certain
that
the
story
was
all
over
green
hill
even
sarah
said
something
to
me
before
i
went
to
bed
somehow
i
should
have
thought
my
helplessness
would
have
protected
me
a
little
after
my
guests
had
gone
doctor
denton
appeared
on
the
scene
macallister
and
i
will
carry
you
up
to
your
room
now
miss
carroll
he
said
cheerily
i
felt
very
tired
very
cross
and
behaved
i
afraid
like
a
schoolgirl
if
you
get
doctor
mac
and
father
he
went
quite
white
very
well
he
said
stiffly
and
turned
away
i
did
not
see
him
again
that
day
or
for
several
days
thereafter
i
wonder
if
he
really
said
that
i
could
for
all
of
him
new

contrary
princess
do
you
think
it
kind
of
your
royal
benevolence
to
write
me
the
most
charming
note
in
the
world
to
thank
me
for
my
flowers
and
then
to
almost
ruin
it
by
a
postscript
a
scolding
dare
i
say
nagging
postscript
in
which
you
sternly
forbid
me
to
give
myself
pleasure
and
send
you
anything
more
ever
you
are
an
an
indian
that
what
you
are
and
i
refuse
to
have
any
dealings
with
your
postscript
i
will
separate
it
carefully
from
the
rest
of
the
letter
and
consign
it
to
candle
flame
i
am
glad
you
enjoyed
your
lawn
party
sorry
though
that
anything
should
have
happened
during
your
at
home
day
to
disturb
you
although
you
do
not
tell
me
what
it
was
i
have
put
two
and
two
together
made
a
hundred
and
six
and
deducted
that
some
member
of
my
blundering
and
sex
stepped
upon
your
sensibilities
but
i
am
sure
you
have
forgiven
him
by
now
although
far
be
it
from
me
to
hold
any
brief
for
an
unknown
and
hated
rival
please
may
i
come
to
your
next
party
i
am
sure
my
mother
would
be
willing
to
chaperone
me
i
forwarded
her
your
last
note
it
was
addressed
to
her
and
i
did
not
dare
keep
it
but
i
read
it
yes
i
did
and
i
do
not
notice
that
you
scolded
her
about
those
bed
socks
indeed
you
seemed
very
glad
to
have
them
she
has
been
fretting
i
know
that
they
were
not
finished
sooner
but
she
was
called
away
as
no
doubt
she
told
you
in
her
letter
by
an
illness
in
the
family
my
respects
to
wiggles
i
wonder
if
he
is
entirely
cognizant
of
his
good
fortune
i
have
told
you
once
that
everything
john
denton
says
of
me
is
false
unless
it
is
particularly
pleasant
and
then
it
hardly
does
me
justice
now
after
my
repeated
demands
will
you
tell
me
what
he
said
yours
very
truly
richard

i
have
found
more
in
the
business

than
i
had
dreamed
existed
let
me
repeat
it
another
way
very
truly
yours
september
dear
and
caviling
poet
you
deserved
to
be
scolded
but
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
and
i
have
decided
to
relent
and
tell
you
what
john
denton
said
he
said
that
you
were
shy
that
you
were
very
blonde
that
you
were
very
impractical
that
you
were
very
generous
that
you
were
an
incorrigible
dreamer
and
that
he
thought
you
were
in
love
what
have
you
to
reply
to
these
six
counts
of

indictment

green

september
the
new
young
man
has
arrived
in
our
village
an
embarrassment
of
riches
he
is
a
college
friend
of
that
doctor
person
a
painter
and
a
poet
as
well
i
have
graciously
given
my
consent
that
he
be
brought
to
call
i
wonder
what
he
looks
like
not
like
his
name
i
hope
which
is
penny
father
just
came
upstairs
and
asked
me
if
i
would
be
ready
to
see
denton
in
fifteen
minutes
he
looked
quite
funny
when
he
said
it
and
seemed
so
ill
at
ease
i
ca
imagine
well
diary
although
the
doctor
does
deserve
it
i
fancy
i
shall
call
sarah
and
tell
her
to
get
me
the
bed
jacket
which
is
so
becoming
to
my
room
three
hours
later
diary
it
not
possible
i
ca
believe
it
i
been
here
half
an
hour
alone
trying
to
realize
all
that
it
will
mean
to
me
and
trying
to
collect
my
thoughts
fifteen
minutes
to
the
second
after
father
spoke
to
me
about
this
impending
and
oddly
formal
visit
of
the
doctor
he
ushered
that
gentleman
into
the
room
placed
a
low
chair
for
him
by
the
bed
and
then
taking
my
hands
said
very
gravely
mavis
denton
wants
to
talk
to
you
for
a
little
while
he
has
something
which
he
is
very
anxious
to
persuade
you
to
do
i
have
told
him
that
without
your
consent
it
is
impossible
you
know
that
i
will
never
force
you
to
anything
but
will
you
listen
to
him
dear
and
for
all
our
sakes
try
to
say
as
if
he
had
to
plead
with
me
my
father
for
whom
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
since
the
day
i
was
brought
home
broken
i
have
never
seen
my
father
so
moved
more
out
of
nervousness
than
anything
else
i
said
daddy
it
sounds
like
a
proposal
the
minute
i
said
it
i
was
sorry
and
glad
for
although
father
laughed
denton
looked
perfectly
furious
it
must
be
painful
to
turn
the
color
he
does
like
a
a
chameleon
then
father
kissed
me
under
his
breath
i
heard
him
say
god
bless
my
mavis
and
in
a
moment
i
was
alone
with
the
enemy
the
eyes
regarded
me
for
a
full
moment
and
then
almost
sternly
he
spoke
miss
carroll
he
said
with
your
permission
and
with
your
help
without
which
we
can
do
nothing
we
are
going
to
ask
you
to
make
a
series
of
efforts
first
to
sit
erect
unaided
then
to
stand
and
by
slow
degrees
to
walk
there
was
something
so
confident
in
his
tone
perhaps
he
might
have
gone
on
but
i
flung
out
both
hands
to
him
and
he
waited
doctor
i
cried
doctor
it
is
possible
i
have
tried
they
made
me
try
at
first
and
it
nearly
killed
me
do
make
me
i
begged
childishly
do
make
me
go
through
all
that
horror
again
there
will
be
no
horror
he
said
deliberately
there
will
be
pain
yes
but
comparatively
slight
all
through
the
summer
i
have
watched
your
case
little
by
little
we
have
stimulated
the
unused
muscles
as
you
have
gained
in
vitality
at
the
time
following
your
accident
it
was
naturally
torture
to
you
to
be
forced
to
submit
to
the
hands
of
doctors
and
nurses
but
eleven
years
have
gone
by
and
i
am
convinced
and
have
convinced
both
our
good
friend
macallister
and
your
father
that
the
injury
to
your
back
has
long
since
healed
and
that
nothing
remains
but
the
inflexibility
of
the
muscles
and
if
i
may
term
it
such
a
type
of
mental
paralysis
you
mean
i
began
not
yet
believing
i
mean
he
interrupted
that
your
mind
has
persuaded
your
body
that
it
will
never
walk
again
now
know
better
yours
is
not
the
first
case
of
this
sort
which
has
been
brought
to
my
attention
i
have
seen
six
cures
out
of
eight
such
cases
during
my
studies
abroad
they
interested
me
very
much
it
was
primarily
your
case
that
brought
me
to
green
hill
and
the
cure
please
believe
me
rests
entirely
with
you
i
do
believe
it
i
said
flatly
staring
at
him
it
simply
possible
that
half
a
hundred
doctors
have
been
mistaken
and
my
eyes
although
my
tongue
did
not
said
very
plainly
and
who
are
you
for
the
first
time
he
smiled
i
am
sorry
he
said
if
i
have
been
unable
to
inspire
you
with
so
little
confidence
the
a
hundred
doctors
were
probably
quite
correct
at
the
time
they
had
your
case
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
have
had
a
specialist
six
no
seven
years
i
answered
and
shuddered
i
thought
so
he
said
and
then
very
suddenly
miss
carroll
do
you
to
walk
again
do
you
want
to
be
a
normal
active
girl
instead
of
a
i
hated
his
tone
of
course
i
do
i
fairly
shouted
do
do
you
think
i
a
fool
sometimes
answered
the
amazing
creature
calmly
i
was
too
angry
to
speak
look
here
miss
carroll
he
said
quietly
let
get
down
to
brass
tacks
for
eleven
years
you
have
lain
on
your
back
allowing
yourself
to
be
waited
on
coddled
wrapped
in
cotton
wool
you
have
had
the
companionship
of
your
father
who
is
the
finest
man
in
the
world
but
whose
whole
life
is
wrapped
up
in
you
and
who
has
sacrificed
that
life
to
your
whims
and
your
desires
your
father
was
never
meant
to
be
buried
down
here
not
with
that
personality
and
fine
brain
think
of
the
doors
which
should
be
open
to
him
and
which
your
illness
has
closed
travel
society
the
exploration
of
places
and
people
instead
of
a
rather
pretty
very
narrow
connecticut
you
have
had
sarah
sentimental
to
a
degree
under
a
rocky
exterior
ready
and
anxious
to
work
her
fingers
to
the
bone
to
please
you
you
have
had
an
entire
village
at
your
beck
and
call
have
dispensed
justice
and
advice
from
your
bed
like
royalty
and
you
have
thrived
on
it
my
dear
lady
thrived
on
the
adoration
and
the
sacrifice
and
on
your
own
martyrdom
now
i
am
here
solely
to
give
you
a
chance
to
repay
your
father
and
all
the
others
for
their
love
and
care
and
coddling
do
you
realize
that
your
father
is
a
comparatively
young
man
that
by
tying
him
to
your
bedside
you
have
narrowed
his
life
down
until
it
consists
of
this
room
this
house
this
tiny
village
it
up
to
you
to
give
something
to
your
father
it
may
cost
you
pain
but
i
wonder
if
you
have
any
idea
of
what
you
have
cost
him
in
heartache
are
you
willing
to
make
the
effort
if
only
for
his
sake
no
one
in
all
my
life
had
ever
spoken
to
me
like
that
i
was
so
hurt
so
outraged
so
bewildered
it
seemed
as
if
i
just
could
live
a
minute
longer
with
that
cool
cutting
voice
in
my
ears
you
you
brute
i
said
choking
it
not
fair
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
i
am
selfish
and
unkind
that
i
do
love
my
father
that
i
am
a
useless
worthless
hypochondriac
he
smiled
perhaps
i
would
put
it
quite
so
strongly
he
suggested
courteously
i
shut
my
hands
hard
under
the
bedclothes
and
held
my
head
very
high
very
well
i
told
him
rather
viciously
i
will
do
all
you
say
if
father
and
doctor
macallister
are
agreed
i
could
feel
the
red
spots
burning
on
my
cheeks
and
in
my
mind
i
was
saying
over
and
over
like
a
child
i
show
you
show
you
i
think
i
almost
hoped
i
should
die
just
to
make
him
sorry
and
it
was
so
hard
to
keep
the
tears
back
i
would
cry
i
i
cried
suddenly
his
arm
was
around
me
and
his
voice
so
changed
so
immeasurably
gentle
was
saying
very
close
you
poor
little
kid
i
hate
you
i
said
at
that
the
arm
tightened
then
dropped
denton
rose
good
he
said
heartily
towering
above
me
that
something
to
work
on
well
i
have
your
promise
and
for
love
of
your
father
and
hate
of
me
you
walk
yet
before
the
winter
and
now
i
will
send
sarah
to
you
with
something
to
quiet
those
outraged
feelings
tomorrow
we
begin
the
treatment
then
he
left
the
room
and
that
all
diary
i
had
a
talk
with
father
i
ca
set
it
down
here
it
was
too
beautiful
and
too
intimate
but
now
that
i
realize
all
that
it
has
meant
this
long
illness
of
mine
and
all
that
my
recovery
might
mean
to
him
i
am
willing
to
undergo
any
torture
any
agony
willing
even
to
endure
the
cruel
magician
and
his
black
magic
how
i
hate
him
diary
it
makes
me
feel
quite
strong
to
hate
anyone
so
i
who
have
always
cared
for
people
and
lived
on
their
love
what
have
i
just
written
lived
on
their
love
i
wonder
if
he
is
right
if
i
have
taken
everything
and
given
nothing
in
return
tonight
with
my
mind
and
soul
in
chaos
i
wish
more
than
ever
that
my
mother
had
lived
dear
diary
silent
and
loyal
confidant
wish
me
well
for
tomorrow
green
hill
september
yesterday
diary
was
the
most
exhausting
day
i
have
ever
survived
an
alternate
succession
of
massage
and
naps
and
naps
and
massage
and
two
efforts
to
sit
up
the
first
was
quite
unsuccessful
i
was
trembling
all
over
with
excitement
and
perhaps
fear
and
at
the
very
first
attempt
fear
of
pain
and
the
immediate
succeeding
pain
itself
absolutely
unnerved
me
mac
standing
close
beside
the
bed
looked
across
at
his
colleague
he
did
shake
his
head
but
the
expression
in
his
keen
old
eyes
was
equivalent
denton
frowned
will
you
try
again
in
a
few
minutes
miss
carroll
he
asked
ignoring
mac
and
the
little
hurt
despairing
sound
which
i
could
help
making
i
ca
i
said
flatly
he
spread
out
his
hands
in
an
entirely
foreign
gesture
of
defeat
of
course
if
you
prefer
not
he
suggested
sketchily
there
was
something
so
positively
scornful
in
the
look
he
bent
on
me
that
i
writhed
i
made
my
two
eyes
as
much
like
swords
as
possible
i
hope
diary
that
they
were
not
crossed
and
snapped
do
you
mean
to
imply
suddenly
i
stopped
i
was
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
and
it
was
not
until
i
saw
their
frosty
expression
change
to
something
distinctly
like
triumph
that
i
discovered
that
was
sitting
up
actually
but
only
for
the
fraction
of
a
minute
it
was
the
discovery
itself
i
think
that
laid
me
flat
again
with
mac
arm
around
me
and
his
disengaged
hand
stretched
across
the
bed
frantically
shaking
denton
laddie
is
he
was
saying
with
a
remarkable
rolling
of
his
r
but
denton
was
looking
at
me
you
see
he
said
quietly
that
after
all
you
do
it
it
is
only
a
matter
of
patience
and
the
will
to
conquer
and
perhaps
a
certain
amount
of
impetus
he
was
smiling
quite
flushed
his
eyes
more
brilliant
than
i
had
ever
seen
them
and
now
he
said
suppose
i
go
down
and
tell
your
father
he
has
been
walking
the
floor
ever
since
we
came
up
i
know
we
wo
bother
you
again
today
miss
carroll
but
tomorrow
you
going
to
be
perfectly
amazed
to
see
how
easy
it
will
be
to
repeat
the
performance
after
he
had
gone
mac
walked
around
my
little
room
loquacious
for
once
in
his
life
is
he
a
wonder
he
kept
asking
me
lassie
it
worth
living
for
just
to
meet
a
man
like
that
the
born
healer
he
kept
saying
over
and
over
the
born
healer
i
no
doubt
i
said
politely
that
denton
is
a
very
able
physician
mac
stopped
in
his
tracks
so
suddenly
that
he
nearly
fell
over
what
this
what
this
he
said
his
bushy
eyebrows
drawn
down
over
his
eyes
so
closely
that
i
could
not
see
their
expression
i
repeated
my
remark
one
piercing
glance
the
suspicion
of
a
twinkle
a
deep
disconcerting
chuckle
and
then
my
old
friend
said
cryptically
so
that
the
way
the
land
lies
little
mavis
what
do
you
mean
i
began
irritably
i
seem
to
be
in
a
continual
state
of
annoyance
these
days
diary
but
he
had
gone
and
all
the
way
downstairs
i
could
hear
him
chuckling
even
my
succeeding
little
thanksgiving
talk
with
father
failed
to
put
me
in
a
good
humor
again
i
think
doctor
mac
is
horrid
but
if
i
am
cured
diary
wo
i
make
them
sit
up
new
york
city
september
dear
lady
have
i
offended
you
in
any
way
richard
warren
the
castle
september
dear
poet
certainly
not
but
when
one
is
slowly
and
forcibly
being
resurrected
one
has
little
time
for
letter
writing
shall
i
tell
you
the
program
which
has
been
laid
out
for
me
but
first
of
all
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
actually
able
to
sit
up
for
a
few
moments
each
day
and
after
i
grow
stronger
and
more
daring
a
chair
is
to
be
substituted
for
my
bed
and
then
a
wheel
chair
and
maybe
after
that
a
real
live
automobile
and
finally
so
i
have
been
promised
i
am
to
learn
to
walk
fancy
being
such
a
baby
but
this
very
morning
the
biggest
most
expensive
busiest
specialist
in
the
country
who
knew
me
eleven
years
ago
when
he
was
not
quite
so
big
or
expensive
or
busy
came
to
our
little
house
and
after
a
prolonged
examination
told
us
that
there
was
no
reason
on
earth
why
i
should
not
recover
wholly
and
absolutely
it
will
take
time
he
said
but
it
is
certain
and
i
need
undergo
no
knife
or
painful
treatment
i
am
only
to
mind
and
not
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
i
feel
as
if
link
by
link
the
fetters
were
falling
i
hardly
dare
think
ahead
to
the
day
when
the
great
round
world
shall
be
mine
again
to
the
day
when
i
shall
go
to
all
the
places
i
only
know
from
books
and
pictures
i
want
to
go
to
the
theatre
i
want
to
see
a
horse
race
i
want
to
sail
in
a
boat
and
i
want
to
walk
and
walk
and
walk
and
poet
i
want
to
fly
i
must
never
be
very
athletic
they
say
probably
i
shall
never
ride
or
skate
or
even
drive
a
car
i
do
know
it
matter
of
course
but
i
do
hope
that
i
may
dance
i
dreamed
of
dancing
you
know
in
my
dreams
i
am
always
strong
and
well
you
are
happy
with
me
and
for
me
i
am
sure
and
sometimes
i
think
that
your
letters
and
your
friendship
have
given
me
courage
and
faith
which
otherwise
i
should
not
have
had
it
must
be
a
beautiful
world
and
life
must
be
a
wonderful
thing
if
poets
can
live
and
make
us
see
beauty
through
their
clear
eyes
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
and
all
through
the
perils
and
adventures
of
being
reborn
i
shall
be
glad
to
feel
that
you
are
thinking
of
me
and
holding
your
thumbs
will
you
please
do
you
know
a
named
penny
at
least
that
is
his
real
name
he
writes
under
a
slightly
more
suitable
cognomen
but
i
have
been
unable
in
our
brief
acquaintance
to
drag
it
from
him
he
seems
a
very
nice
person
indeed
and
made
a
long
call
on
me
this
morning
wiggles
wags
yours
in
at
least
the
fifth
heaven
me
green
hill
september
diary
denton
brought
the
to
see
me
today
perhaps
as
a
flag
of
truce
at
all
events
it
was
more
than
an
amusing
experience
i
was
propped
up
in
my
now
very
ambitious
position
feeding
wiggles
tea
biscuits
and
reading
lyric
for
the
millionth
time
when
the
two
men
appeared
i
was
declaiming
aloud
slightly
drunk
by
the
most
marvellously
day
and
feeling
tremendously
strong
and
happy
after
the
introductions
i
brought
you
good
medicine
miss
carroll
said
denton
indicating
his
embarrassed
friend
a
real
live
poet
the
only
one
in
captivity
eats
out
of
the
hand
but
i
warn
you
he
is
modest
the
proverbial
violet
is
brazen
compared
to
wright
and
he
wo
lionize
worth
a
nickel
and
i
am
sworn
to
silence
concerning
his
prowess
with
the
pen
and
even
his
penny
is
it
a
dreadful
name
and
combined
with
wright
too
sat
down
limply
in
the
chair
beside
me
please
he
said
pleasantly
and
plaintively
do
pay
any
attention
to
him
i
never
do
i
said
in
my
sugariest
tones
denton
lowered
his
inches
to
the
ground
and
there
sprawled
like
a
starfish
regarded
me
brightly
she
truthful
he
assured
his
friend
she
never
does
and
no
idea
how
she
dislikes
me
that
handicaps
you
at
the
start
wright
old
fellow
does
it
miss
carroll
i
considered
penny
amiable
blonde
countenance
judicially
it
might
i
agreed
you
see
this
from
the
creature
in
a
piercing
stage
whisper
but
it
does
i
finished
smiling
brilliantly
at
penny
who
appeared
slightly
confused
catching
at
a
straw
which
happened
to
be
the
beloved
the
unknown
i
simply
ca
call
him
penny
all
the
time
it
too
ridiculous
picked
up
the
book
which
was
lying
beside
me
and
immediately
gave
the
most
theatrical
start
i
have
ever
seen
never
seen
plays
of
course
but
i
have
read
them
and
know
stage
directions
when
i
see
them
in
the
flesh
this
was
a
particularly
good
example
of
confronted
with
the
revolver
sebastian
starts
violently
richard
warren
read
the
stranger
aloud
with
a
very
poor
affectation
of
indifference
yes
i
said
do
you
know
him
the
penny
turned
a
beautiful
crimson
i
read
the
book
he
faltered
my
back
may
be
weak
but
my
eyes
are
good
and
the
glance
that
passed
between
denton
and
his
friend
did
not
escape
me
it
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
old
man
said
the
former
soothingly
particularly
as
it
appears
to
be
miss
carroll
chief
literary
diet
is
it
asked
my
guest
rather
excitedly
i
thought
i
adore
it
i
answered
with
all
the
schoolgirl
fervor
i
could
muster
and
it
rang
true
diary
for
it
is
denton
looked
at
me
keenly
lucky
book
he
said
lightly
while
penny
added
almost
under
his
breath
lucky
author
he
has
nice
doggie
brown
eyes
and
very
fair
hair
i
smiled
into
the
former
and
longed
to
stroke
the
latter
it
was
so
very
smooth
and
shining
wo
you
tell
me
about
your
own
work
i
asked
beguilingly
yes
do
urged
denton
politely
the
unknown
blushed
some
more
i
i
he
began
somewhat
wildly
please
let
not
i
very
new
at
the
game
and
his
voice
trailed
off
and
he
sat
hunched
up
in
his
chair
looking
at
me
most
pitifully
i
was
honestly
sorry
for
him
although
not
a
little
intrigued
and
most
inexplicably
suspicious
here
wiggles
i
said
let
talk
about
him
is
he
a
duck
wiggles
very
sleek
and
beautiful
jumped
gaily
into
my
visitor
lap
and
they
became
firm
friends
at
once
why
i
said
watching
them
he
acts
as
if
he
knew
you
penny
looked
up
quickly
i
one
much
like
him
at
home
he
said
perhaps
your
puppy
recognizes
that
all
my
clothes
are
very
doggy
he
added
with
a
perfectly
charming
smile
wiggles
i
said
has
excellent
judgment
generally
it
was
impossible
not
to
cast
the
smallest
swiftest
glance
possible
at
my
enemy
as
i
said
it
i
had
the
advantage
but
denton
from
the
ground
deliberately
grinned
at
me
she
means
he
explained
carefully
that
wiggles
is
quite
partial
to
me
and
of
course
she
can
not
understand
it
he
reached
up
a
long
lazy
arm
and
removed
the
dog
from
his
lap
then
lying
flat
on
his
back
and
holding
wiggles
quite
close
to
his
face
he
very
calmly
winked
at
him
and
believe
it
or
not
diary
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
wiggles
solemnly
and
unmistakably
if
that
is
black
magic
what
is
it
after
that
we
three
chatted
comfortably
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
penny
gradually
coming
forth
from
his
shell
proved
a
wholly
delightful
companion
and
i
flirted
i
read
about
it
in
books
of
course
but
have
been
able
to
practise
very
much
still
i
think
i
did
very
well
for
a
beginner
i
am
sure
denton
thought
so
too
for
once
i
heard
him
say
minx
to
wiggles
quite
fretfully
anyway
he
did
seem
to
like
it
when
they
got
up
to
go
i
begged
penny
to
come
again
his
response
was
very
flattering
indeed
i
will
he
began
but
denton
interrupted
him
i
thought
you
had
a
pressing
engagement
in
town
he
said
significantly
penny
made
a
really
magnificent
gesture
of
carelessness
i
have
forgotten
it
he
said
i
reminding
you
said
his
old
college
chum
nastily
i
put
down
my
hand
to
wiggles
who
kissed
it
obligingly
were
you
ever
in
a
manger
wiggles
darling
i
asked
with
interest
wiggles
barked
and
penny
who
had
just
discovered
that
denton
had
been
lying
on
his
hat
turned
to
me
with
an
expression
of
bewilderment
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
with
his
ruined
headgear
in
his
hand
i
was
just
speaking
to
wiggles
i
assured
him
oh
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
thought
me
mad
still
he
must
like
a
certain
form
of
insanity
for
his
farewell
was
almost
tragic
as
he
left
he
bent
near
me
and
said
quite
low
i
awfully
glad
you
like
richard
warren
miss
carroll
why
i
asked
innocently
but
if
he
answered
at
all
his
reply
was
swallowed
up
in
denton
laugh
an
insulting
cachinnation
to
say
the
least
and
as
left
the
creature
bent
near
me
and
said
quite
loudly
you
do
fight
fair
adversary
i
suppose
diary
if
i
repeat
how
much
i
dislike
him
you
will
finally
cease
to
believe
me
but
i
think
you
may
safely
take
it
for
granted
is
it
odd
that
penny
should
be
very
blond
and
shy
it
possible
that
of
course
not
and
yet
well
foolish
of
me
or
not
it
will
be
difficult
to
write
richard
warren
now
as
long
as
i
half
suspect
there
was
a
stiltedness
about
my
letter
to
him
today
even
and
yet
i
ca
quite
believe
it
probably
john
denton
was
only
drawing
on
his
imagination
after
all
still
new
york
city
september
dear
lady
i
have
been
out
of
town
for
a
few
days
and
when
i
returned
was
greeted
by
your
letter
even
the
envelope
looked
happy
and
i
am
so
supremely
glad
for
you
the
keys
of
my
typewriter
would
sing
like
a
piano
if
they
could
is
that
the
most
absurd
sentence
but
i
feel
absurdly
gay
myself
for
now
perhaps
i
can
persuade
you
to
let
me
come
to
your
next
lawn
party
you
never
answered
my
question
by
the
way
so
being
a
persistent
devil
i
repeat
it
may
i
honestly
i
eat
with
a
fork
and
my
hair
is
cut
in
accordance
with
the
usual
rather
hideous
fashion
set
for
members
of
my
sex
i
do
seem
to
remember
your
friend
with
the
interesting
name
perhaps
if
you
could
discover
his
pen
name
but
i
really
know
very
few
people
of
writing
bent
i
been
out
of
town
and
was
delightfully
entertained
by
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
and
have
come
back
with
tons
of
inspiration
for
the
new
book
which
by
the
way
is
rapidly
growing
denton
is
anxious
for
an
early
publication
but
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
complete
the
volume
until
spring
would
you
care
for
it
as
a
present
i
should
be
very
proud
dear
little
lady
i
am
certain
that
these
must
be
very
trying
days
for
you
and
i
am
holding
my
thumbs
hard
our
pen
and
ink
friendship
has
been
so
dear
to
me
all
these
summer
months
it
has
been
both
letter
and
spirit
has
it
not
can
you
forgive
the
atrocious
punning
and
i
am
hoping
that
very
soon
you
will
make
yourself
known
to
me
and
let
me
come
where
you
are
and
tell
you
but
until
you
do

always
richard
warren
october
dear
warren
please
please
do
ask
me
to
let
you
come
i
am
so
afraid
of
so
many
things
and
i
am
certain
that
you
would
be
very
disillusioned
really
i
a
most
disagreeable
person
in
the
flesh
i
can
refer
you
to
at
least
one
person
who
sees
me
every
day
and
who
thinks
so
wo
you
be
content
to
allow
me
to
remain
just
a
small
and
i
hope
sympathetic
voice
out
of
an
unknown
darkness
very
sincerely
your
friend
green
hill
october
diary
dear
i
have
written
richard
warren
that
our
acquaintance
must
remain
a
one
it
is
so
much
wiser
to
leave
things
that
way
once
i
would
have
been
tempted
but
somehow
now
i
am
not
adeline
denton
cook
arrived
this
morning
armed
with
one
of
her
inimitable
chocolate
cakes
and
a
note
from
her
wretched
employer
i
received
her
rather
coldly
i
am
afraid
but
i
have
not
yet
recovered
from
the
incident
however
she
is
a
disarming
creature
and
the
cake
which
in
part
graced
my
luncheon
tray
was
delicious
i
ca
offer
you
any
but
i
can
set
down
for
your
amusement
the
accompanying
script
green
hill
october
my
dear
miss
carroll
as
i
have
a
number
of
messages
to
deliver
to
you
from
our
mutual
friend
penny
and
also
a
matter
which
i
wish
to
personally
discuss
with
you
may
i
invite
myself
to
tea
this
afternoon
i
have
ascertained
you
see
that
your
father
will
be
in
the
city
in
a
professional
capacity
i
am
able
to
go
and
come
as
i
please
but
as
this
call
is
quite
unprofessional
in
character
and
partakes
somewhat
of
the
nature
of
an
armed
truce
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
come
without
your
consent
adeline
will
wait
for
your
answer
i
am
meantime
scouring
the
town
for
a
white
flag
yours
very
sincerely
william
denton
i
must
confess
diary
to
a
seizure
of
acute
curiosity
weakly
i
bade
adeline
tell
her
master
to
wait
on
me
at
four
and
sending
for
sarah
ordered
extra
tea
with
which
to
placate
the
savage
appetite
of
my
guest
we
had
tea
for
october
has
come
in
like
a
spring
day
warm
and
clear
and
beautiful
i
was
in
my
hammock
whither
sarah
and
father
had
conveyed
me
at
three
just
before
father
train
left
green
hill
and
had
therefore
an
hour
of
speculation
and
it
was
not
without
a
certain
thrill
of
excitement
that
i
saw
a
tall
lean
figure
swing
across
the
lawn
towards
me
and
appropriate
the
low
chair
beside
me
and
the
tea
table
good
afternoon
i
said
politely
good
afternoon
he
answered
it
was
nice
of
you
to
let
me
come
wiggles
a
sixth
doggie
sense
telling
him
i
had
a
caller
came
racing
across
to
us
from
the
kitchen
garden
where
i
have
no
doubt
he
had
been
destructively
employed
and
greeted
the
doctor
with
an
exaggerated
display
of
cordiality
when
he
was
disposed
of
finally
under
my
visitor
chair
lovely
day
i
proffered
one
hand
concealing
a
tiny
yawn
lovely
agreed
denton
enthusiastically
conversation
languished
died
finally
the
silence
becoming
quite
unbearable
i
stole
a
look
at
the
enemy
his
lips
were
pursed
in
a
noiseless
whistle
his
hands
were
informally
in
his
pocket
and
his
eyes
were
dancing
it
is
disconcerting
that
i
should
have
to
acknowledge
his
extreme
good
looks
i
never
did
care
much
for
men
anyway
they
so
disgustingly
conceited
and
denton
possesses
an
almost
spectacular
combination
of
features
coloring
and
build
did
you
speak
he
asked
gently
i
did
not
said
i
with
emphasis
do
shoot
begged
the
unwelcome
one
i
come
down
or
he
asked
anxiously
can
you
see
the
whites
of
my
eyes
i
laughed
i
could
help
it
the
situation
was
so
perfectly
ridiculous
and
so
we
laughed
together
sarah
beaming
appeared
with
tea
and
cookies
and
cake
please
pour
i
said
to
denton
and
please
have
some
of
your
own
cake
thank
you
i
added
carefully
for
sending
it
to
us
oh
i
did
send
it
he
answered
cheerfully
manipulating
china
and
silver
with
dexterity
it
was
adeline
thought
merely
she
asked
my
permission
oh
i
said
in
a
small
voice
and
accepted
a
cup
of
tea
denton
fed
wiggles
cake
and
engaged
him
in
loud
conversation
i
scalded
my
throat
on
tea
and
promptly
dropped
the
cup
this
at
least
created
some
diversion
denton
sprang
up
scattering
wiggles
cups
napkins
and
spoons
with
equal
indifference
and
mopped
up
the
deluge
did
you
hurt
yourself
he
asked
in
quite
an
agonized
tone
no
i
replied
dripping
but
i
have
burned
my
throat
most
awfully
i
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
talk
for
quite
a
while
may
i
see
spoke
the
physician
with
solicitude
i
put
out
my
tongue
very
soberly
denton
returned
hastily
to
his
chair
you
spoke
i
suggested
in
your
note
of
messages
did
i
he
returned
in
a
puzzled
tone
it
must
be
my
handwriting
no
doctor
writes
intelligibly
this
was
really
too
much
i
beat
with
my
fist
upon
the
unoffending
hammock
and
asked
has
your
friend
gone
yes
very
unfortunately
he
had
as
i
reminded
him
a
pressing
engagement
in
town
i
myself
took
him
to
the
train
concluded
the
aggravating
creature
proudly
how
nice
of
you
i
said
heartily
but
you
must
miss
him
intolerably
the
duologue
showed
symptoms
of
declining
again
finally
did
you
want
to
see
me
i
asked
courteously
not
particularly
he
replied
but
under
the
white
flag
as
i
suggested
i
wanted
to
make
a
partial
treaty
with
you
with
of
course
your
consent
i
am
listening
i
said
cautiously
suddenly
he
moved
his
chair
nearer
crossed
his
legs
and
lay
back
hands
locked
across
his
knees
look
here
he
said
is
it
time
that
we
declared
ourselves
in
open
battle
this
guerilla
warfare
he
paused
suggestively
and
i
waited
you
have
made
it
very
plain
he
went
on
that
you
do
not
like
me
perhaps
i
am
putting
it
mildly
at
all
events
as
your
medical
adviser
i
am
forced
to
inflict
my
presence
frequently
upon
you
your
father
likes
me
sarah
likes
me
wiggles
likes
me
could
you
he
asked
earnestly
try
to
overcome
your
aversion
for
the
sake
of
the
majority
i
considered
i
think
not
i
said
finally
very
well
having
appealed
to
your
filial
respect
your
better
self
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
ask
you
to
sign
a
temporary
armistice
for
i
am
beginning
to
find
your
concentrated
attack
rather
wearing
i
smiled
i
wish
said
denton
carefully
to
give
you
every
opportunity
to
humiliate
and
infuriate
me
i
have
always
believed
a
little
aversion
to
be
an
excellent
beginning
to
matrimony
i
do
suppose
he
continued
hopefully
that
by
way
of
simplifying
things
you
would
care
to
marry
me
he
bit
into
a
large
sugar
cookie
reflectively
marry
i
shouted
sitting
bolt
upright
i
can
do
it
now
diary
if
the
occasion
demands
marry
said
he
with
the
utmost
calmness
but
with
twinkling
eyes
i
collapsed
i
think
you
are
perfectly
insane
i
began
and
then
ceased
for
want
of
words
denton
sighed
i
was
afraid
i
could
persuade
you
he
said
let
us
pass
to
the
next
point
i
was
still
gasping
like
a
fish
you
find
your
throat
better
with
your
mouth
open
he
asked
with
interest
i
closed
it
with
a
snap
and
kept
it
closed
as
my
wife
he
remarked
you
would
have
ample
opportunities
for
delicate
and
refined
torture
however
you
have
called
me
perhaps
rightly
a
am
i
to
infer
that
you
still
continue
to
regard
me
in
that
unflattering
light
i
nodded
speech
by
now
was
wholly
beyond
me
and
i
he
went
on
have
intimated
what
i
as
an
honest
man
think
of
you
it
is
quite
plain
that
i
do
not
like
you
any
better
than
you
like
me
you
have
i
think
the
makings
of
a
rather
nice
girl
but
i
have
never
cared
for
kittens
now
that
we
are
agreed
to
disagree
miss
carroll
will
you
shake
hands
with
me
and
for
the
sake
of
our
enforced
relationship
pledge
yourself
neither
to
stab
me
in
the
back
or
bite
me
when
i
am
not
looking
when
you
are
quite
well
again
i
am
at
your
mercy
but
until
then
i
must
entreat
you
not
to
hamper
your
recovery
and
blast
my
medical
reputation
by
consistently
opposing
me
at
every
turn
are
you
willing
to
play
friends
with
me
until
such
time
when
i
can
set
you
on
your
feet
he
held
out
his
hand
and
smiled
the
whole
thing
was
ridiculous
and
he
had
been
unnecessarily
insulting
and
yet
it
was
a
nice
smile
diary
i
have
even
seen
my
peterkins
smile
just
like
that
hopefully
ingratiatingly
and
after
all
i
do
owe
him
so
much
silently
i
laid
my
hand
in
his
good
said
he
gripping
it
and
tomorrow
you
are
going
to
sit
up
in
a
real
substantial
chair
after
that
you
be
walking
before
you
know
it
the
silly
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
am
grateful
i
faltered
do
be
he
said
cheerfully
if
you
dislike
the
sensation
all
in
the
interest
of
science
you
know
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
wiggles
and
got
up
to
go
i
going
for
sarah
he
said
you
must
be
taken
back
to
your
room
now
it
getting
chilly
once
having
established
me
in
my
room
denton
bent
over
me
and
he
said
very
much
under
his
breath
wo
you
consider
my
proposal
i
meant
it
you
know
and
then
he
had
gone
i
like
to
accept
him
out
of
spite
diary
and
never
having
expected
a
proposal
i
find
even
this
one
somehow
exciting
diary
if
only
you
could
talk
chapter
vii
green
hill
october
diary
it
is
quite
two
weeks
since
i
have
made
an
entry
but
the
thrills
of
actually
sitting
up
in
a
big
chair
downstairs
in
front
of
a
seasonable
log
fire
and
the
even
more
exciting
adventure
of
short
rides
in
the
sheltered
paths
of
a
chrysanthemum
garden
have
for
the
moment
entirely
occupied
my
time
and
thoughts
even
to
the
exclusion
of
you
and
now
father
is
talking
of
taking
me
south
for
the
winter
just
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
walk
a
little
he
wants
to
take
me
and
sarah
and
wiggles
to
florida
so
that
i
need
not
undergo
the
trials
of
a
northern
winter
i
am
worried
about
father
he
does
not
look
and
is
not
at
all
well
the
old
trouble
which
dates
back
to
his
war
days
has
returned
and
with
it
disquieting
heart
symptoms
i
got
mac
off
in
a
corner
lately
and
asked
him
to
tell
me
truly
what
he
thought
of
father
condition
he
seems
so
all
the
time
i
said
and
mac
looked
very
grave
lassie
he
told
me
your
father
a
sick
man
and
a
careless
one
he
not
minded
his
own
aches
and
pains
all
these
years
nor
spared
himself
and
he
not
as
young
as
he
was
when
i
said
something
to
father
he
laughed
at
me
macallister
is
an
old
woman
he
said
fussing
and
fretting
i
be
all
right
presently
my
little
girl
do
worry
the
main
thing
is
to
get
you
on
your
feet
and
then
we
be
off
to
florida
for
a
long
long
holiday
bless
that
boy
he
added
and
i
knew
that
he
meant
denton
well
i
bless
him
too
when
sarah
wheels
me
down
the
garden
paths
and
i
reach
out
to
touch
the
big
friendly
flowers
i
feel
so
strong
so
strong
they
have
to
watch
me
now
for
i
am
like
to
do
all
manner
of
foolish
things
with
the
old
languor
gone
and
the
new
red
blood
singing
through
my
veins
but
when
doctor
denton
comes
and
looks
at
me
out
of
those
cool
eyes
and
asks
well
how
are
the
tantrums
lately
miss
carroll
i
in
no
mood
for
blessing
him
then
green
hill
october
oh
oh
diary
if
you
ever
go
automobiling
you
never
be
content
to
sit
in
my
desk
drawer
again
it
too
wonderful
this
morning
bundled
up
to
my
eyes
i
was
taken
from
my
chair
lifted
into
john
denton
great
grey
purring
beast
and
with
william
denton
at
the
wheel
and
father
and
denton
beside
me
i
was
taken
quietly
and
smoothly
over
the
hill
road
down
the
valley
and
through
the
wide
meadow
road
on
my
first
tour
of
exploration
eleven
years
eleven
years
back
through
the
village
we
came
after
an
all
too
short
somehow
the
news
had
spread
and
from
every
gate
and
window
hands
waved
and
friendly
faces
peered
they
were
glad
to
see
me
the
green
hill
people
is
she
crying
asked
denton
at
the
wheel
with
interest
i
wanted
to
i
wanted
to
cry
and
laugh
and
shout
all
at
once
instead
i
folded
my
hands
more
tightly
in
father
and
said
demurely
sorry
but
she
is
denton
nodded
slouched
down
in
his
seat
his
strong
brown
hands
doing
marvellous
things
to
the
wheel
please
i
asked
denton
next
time
you
take
me
riding
will
you
drive
and
may
i
sit
in
the
front
seat
and
watch
you
steer
everyone
laughed
ask
bill
answered
my
old
friend
i
just
sold
him
the
car
you
may
ride
in
the
front
seat
with
me
announced
denton
graciously
before
i
had
time
to
withdraw
my
request
always
providing
that
you
do
not
clutch
my
arm
at
inopportune
moments
or
scream
as
you
did
six
minutes
back
he
added
when
that
mongrel
pup
appeared
on
the
horizon
a
good
mile
away
i
do
think
i
said
that
after
all
i
care
for
the
front
seat
very
well
said
the
chauffeur
obligingly
as
with
a
turn
and
twist
we
rolled
up
smoothly
before
my
own
front
door
where
sarah
apron
flying
in
the
wind
stood
the
tears
shining
on
her
dear
old
face
front
seat
or
back
i
am
to
ride
every
day
as
long
as
the
good
weather
holds
for
it
has
been
prescribed
for
me
by
no
less
than
two
physicians
in
reputable
professional
standing
no
matter
what
their
respective
dispositions
and
diary
i
love
it
so
that
for
the
sake
of
the
swift
silent
motion
i
would
cheerfully
ride
in
any
seat
whatsoever
regardless
of
the
driver
so
low
have
i
sunk
in
my
new
passion
nervous
asked
denton
as
he
helped
carry
me
to
my
room
i
am
conveyed
now
as
children
are
on
crossed
hands
with
supporting
arms
about
my
back
not
at
all
i
answered
indignantly
that
good
said
he
for
i
am
a
fearsome
driver
i
have
he
said
sinking
his
voice
to
an
whisper
been
known
to
kill
my
men
in
my
day
and
any
amount
of
dogs
strong
men
as
i
pass
have
turned
pale
and
women
fainted
on
the
streets
he
and
denton
laid
me
on
my
bed
and
i
could
only
look
at
him
with
scorn
from
that
ignominious
position
oh
when
i
can
stand
on
my
two
feet
wo
i
well
wo
i
green

november
diary
this
day
i
have
stood
upright
and
taken
my
first
faltering
step
forward
mac
was
there
and
denton
one
on
each
side
and
a
step
away
with
his
arms
wide
my
father
sarah
her
hand
on
mac
arm
took
the
step
with
me
she
was
quite
white
i
was
terribly
weak
and
all
bendy
in
the
middle
but
i
walked
diary
i
i
am
in
bed
now
after
having
been
fussed
over
and
made
much
of
i
am
sure
father
is
out
sending
wires
and
sarah
pops
in
every
two
minutes
to
see
if
i
am
still
alive
i
am
very
much
alive
and
my
whole
soul
is
on
its
knees
in
gratitude
now
almost
for
the
first
time
i
believe
that
i
am
to
be
a
cog
in
the
great
machinery
again
and
no
longer
a
little
broken
thing
thrown
out
forever
on
the
scrap
heap
i
want
to
tell
richard
warren
but
no
word
has
come
from
him
since
my
last
letter
so
i
must
wait
green
hill
december
it
seems
a
year
since
i
last
opened
you
little
blue
friend
for
so
much
has
happened
i
walk
as
if
i
had
always
walked
and
it
no
longer
seems
wonderful
or
blessed
for
my
father
is
very
ill
he
is
up
and
dressed
and
around
but
i
know
and
he
knows
that
it
may
not
be
for
very
long
he
has
been
to
town
to
see
other
doctors
and
when
he
came
back
he
set
his
house
in
order
after
he
had
told
me
his
exact
condition
mavis
he
said
you
are
the
bravest
person
except
your
mother
i
have
ever
known
it
may
be
that
i
shall
live
for
years
it
may
be
that
it
is
only
a
matter
of
weeks
or
months
i
do
know
the
doctors
hold
out
very
little
hope
of
my
recovery
you
are
better
fitted
to
help
me
now
than
ever
you
were
and
he
said
smiling
it
seems
as
if
i
had
nothing
more
to
live
for
now
that
you
are
well
again
and
growing
stronger
every
day
i
was
on
his
lap
in
the
big
still
living
room
father
father
i
said
and
held
his
dear
head
close
against
my
breast
they
ca
take
him
from
me
they
ca
hush
he
said
we
have
had
many
years
of
the
most
beautiful
close
companionship
together
my
daughter
you
have
given
me
more
than
you
know
and
for
a
long
time
i
have
known
he
stopped
why
did
you
tell
me
i
asked
fighting
back
the
tears
i
talked
it
over
he
said
with
denton
and
we
decided
that
it
was
not
wise
as
your
condition
stood
then
always
denton
ordering
my
life
if
only
said
father
very
low
if
only
i
could
leave
you
guarded
protected
you
know
so
little
of
life
i
am
he
whispered
to
himself
responsible
to
her
mother
we
were
quiet
a
long
time
presently
he
put
me
from
him
there
there
he
said
i
hear
peter
calling
you
outside
run
along
dearest
and
let
me
see
you
smile
before
you
go
it
may
be
that
we
will
have
a
long
time
yet
together
kiss
me
mavis
and
smile
diary
i
am
so
terribly
frightened
so
alone
green
hill
december
we
are
getting
ready
for
christmas
the
green
hill
people
have
sent
me
with
their
love
a
beautiful
courageous
tree
and
everyone
has
offered
to
come
and
trim
it
but
we
must
be
very
quiet
on
this
my
first
real
christmas
for
many
years
for
father
is
failing
steadily
he
does
not
complain
but
he
spends
a
great
deal
of
the
day
in
bed
and
he
is
so
white
so
worn
that
my
heart
stands
still
to
look
at
him
if
only
i
could
have
stayed
all
my
life
in
my
little
room
helpless
and
cared
for
if
by
some
strange
twist
of
fate
my
father
could
have
been
spared
this
wasting
illness
i
hate
my
feet
so
eager
to
run
i
hate
my
new
sense
of
and
vitality
i
hate
the
faint
pink
in
my
cheeks
and
all
my
untired
strength
it
is
snowing
today
white
and
soft
and
thick
snow
lies
over
my
garden
like
a
no
i
ca
write
it
green
hill
december
christmas
is
over
and
done
with
i
had
so
many
lovely
gifts
more
than
ever
this
year
it
seems
i
have
put
them
away
the
books
from
denton
the
little
gold
watch
from
father
even
peter
funny
little
card
and
all
the
others
i
ca
seem
to
be
grateful
for
anything
wonderful
roses
reached
me
from
the
city
christmas
morning
there
is
no
card
but
i
know
who
sent
them
why
does
he
write
he
would
help
a
little
i
think
but
i
ca
write
to
him
not
now
green
hill
january
the
new
year
i
ran
over
to
see
goodrich
this
morning
she
is
terribly
distressed
because
goodrich
firm
is
sending
him
abroad
and
he
wants
her
to
go
with
him
they
will
be
travelling
too
much
to
take
peter
and
have
decided
against
it
of
course
i
asked
for
him
and
she
will
let
me
know
father
when
i
told
him
shook
his
head
he
said
nothing
but
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
green
hill
january
father
asked
me
today
if
i
liked
denton
he
asked
me
so
wistfully
and
so
strangely
that
i
could
tell
him
the
truth
they
are
great
friends
i
know
so
i
lied
why
yes
i
said
i
like
him
very
much
i
felt
myself
grow
red
father
patted
my
hand
he
a
good
man
he
said
i
want
you
to
trust
him
mavis
i
have
made
john
denton
your
guardian
you
know
so
little
about
money
and
the
dull
things
of
life
he
added
half
sighing
half
smiling
you
are
after
all
only
a
child
i
tried
to
change
the
subject
as
i
always
do
when
directly
or
indirectly
father
speaks
of
leaving
me
he
seemed
happier
when
i
left
him
than
i
have
seen
him
in
many
days
i
am
glad
diary
that
i
lied
to
him
about
the
enemy
green
hill
january
this
morning
father
was
worse
i
rushed
to
the
and
tried
to
get
mac
but
he
was
out
making
his
calls
so
denton
came
he
sent
me
from
the
room
and
was
with
father
a
long
long
time
when
he
came
out
he
called
me
your
father
wishes
to
see
you
miss
carroll
he
said
denton
i
could
say
any
more
suddenly
he
took
my
two
hands
in
his
firm
warm
grasp
remember
he
said
almost
sternly
that
i
am
at
your
service
always
and
at
his
he
dropped
my
hands
and
turned
away
i
shall
be
back
he
told
me
in
the
afternoon
shaking
all
over
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
doorknob
and
prayed
over
and
over
just
please
god
help
him
and
went
in
father
very
white
held
out
his
hands
come
here
he
said
and
when
i
was
beside
him
mavis
he
said
the
thought
of
leaving
you
alone
now
that
i
feel
certain
that
i
must
leave
you
is
unbearable
i
have
been
talking
today
with
denton
he
wants
to
marry
you
my
dear
and
take
care
of
you
always
for
me
he
has
been
like
my
own
son
to
me
that
boy
he
is
straight
and
true
and
clean
and
i
think
that
i
could
go
on
my
long
journey
with
very
few
regrets
my
mavis
if
i
knew
that
you
were
in
as
safe
hands
as
his
cruel
cruel
my
heart
almost
stopped
and
then
raced
on
again
i
could
speak
father
his
hand
on
mine
looked
at
me
wistfully
entreatingly
i
could
bear
to
have
him
look
like
that
like
a
beggar
and
yet
for
a
moment
i
had
absolutely
no
impulse
of
love
toward
him
he
was
a
stranger
to
me
my
own
father
it
was
impossible
that
it
was
his
voice
asking
me
to
do
this
unthinkable
thing
mavis
i
ca
i
said
in
a
whisper
his
hand
loosened
from
mine
dropped
wearily
to
the
bed
very
well
dearest
he
said
of
course
you
shall
do
nothing
against
your
will
i
only
thought
he
stopped
and
then
it
seemed
a
solution
he
finished
he
looked
very
tired
all
my
love
for
him
came
rushing
back
i
kissed
him
and
he
held
me
close
for
an
instant
will
you
think
it
over
he
asked
slowly
yes
father
i
said
and
was
rewarded
by
his
old
brilliant
smile
once
out
of
the
room
i
brushed
past
sarah
hovering
near
the
door
and
went
to
my
own
room
there
lying
on
my
bed
i
thought
it
over
what
was
it
denton
said
to
me
you
owe
your
father
something
i
have
cried
until
i
have
no
tears
left
rebellious
sick
at
heart
i
ca
and
yet
if
it
would
make
him
any
happier
the
bell
is
ringing
if
that
is
denton
i
will
see
him
before
he
goes
to
father
late
at
night
i
have
said
that
i
will
marry
william
denton
green
hill
january
it
is
only
a
matter
of
days
with
father
now
denton
told
me
that
when
we
had
our
talk
two
days
ago
he
listened
to
what
i
had
to
say
very
quietly
standing
in
front
of
the
fire
his
arms
crossed
and
looking
down
at
the
great
chair
in
which
i
was
half
buried
after
he
had
told
me
about
father
if
you
will
marry
me
miss
carroll
he
said
i
will
do
my
best
to
carry
out
your
wishes
i
can
not
make
you
happy
that
i
know
but
i
can
make
you
safe
until
such
time
as
you
do
not
need
my
protection
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
him
i
mean
he
answered
gravely
that
you
are
very
young
and
that
the
abnormal
life
which
your
accident
forced
you
to
lead
has
peculiarly
unfitted
you
for
any
solitary
encounter
with
the
world
if
you
would
trust
yourself
to
me
i
promise
faithfully
to
care
for
you
to
watch
over
you
and
to
help
you
through
the
first
bewildering
time
after
that
you
may
dispose
of
me
as
you
see
fit
you
mean
i
whispered
again
he
smiled
sombrely
i
am
not
trying
to
bind
you
to
me
he
said
i
am
asking
you
for
your
father
sake
to
let
me
take
care
of
you
for
a
time
when
you
are
quite
strong
and
quite
able
to
look
out
for
yourself
it
will
remain
for
me
to
step
aside
and
you
will
be
free
to
do
and
go
as
you
please
something
of
hope
stirred
faintly
in
me
you
will
let
me
go
then
certainly
i
laid
my
face
against
the
soft
cushions
of
the
chair
marriage
i
said
under
my
breath
i
i
i
could
go
on
it
will
not
be
he
said
very
gently
a
marriage
miss
carroll
it
will
be
a
business
arrangement
you
may
have
my
sacred
word
of
honor
that
i
will
not
trouble
you
in
any
way
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
take
the
steps
to
make
you
quite
free
again
i
stood
up
and
faced
him
you
think
that
father
really
wishes
this
i
asked
it
is
i
know
his
heart
desire
said
denton
and
i
am
tremendously
honored
by
his
faith
in
me
very
well
i
said
and
held
out
my
hand
silently
he
took
it
thank
you
mavis
he
said
quietly
i
was
conscious
of
a
longing
to
escape
it
was
as
if
a
fine
silken
cord
were
tightening
about
me
shall
we
go
to
father
i
asked
him
without
another
word
we
two
walked
from
the
room
remember
he
said
to
me
at
the
door
this
is
for
your
father
we
must
make
believe
for
him
you
and
i
i
nodded
the
door
closed
behind
us
green
hill
january
i
am
to
be
married
tomorrow
it
is
father
wish
he
is
weaker
but
suffers
no
pain
and
he
recognizes
us
all
hours
to
my
wedding
please
god
that
father
will
never
know
how
i
dread
it
john
denton
is
to
give
me
away
and
we
are
to
be
married
from
this
house
with
no
one
but
the
goodriches
and
denton
present
at
the
ceremony
ceremony
the
mockery
of
it
denton
has
given
me
a
ring
it
was
his
mother
he
said
i
have
never
asked
him
about
his
mother
i
do
not
even
know
if
he
has
told
her
nothing
seems
to
matter
very
much
father
january
william
he
has
asked
me
to
call
him
that
came
to
me
this
morning
and
for
the
first
time
in
days
we
talked
together
for
more
than
a
moment
you
are
frightened
he
said
to
me
and
nervous
you
need
not
be
why
why
are
you
marrying
me
i
asked
him
suddenly
why
are
you
marrying
me
he
countered
father
i
said
and
stopped
he
nodded
i
too
he
said
simply
all
at
once
i
realized
what
a
tremendous
sacrifice
he
was
making
i
tried
very
poorly
to
tell
him
not
at
all
he
assured
me
i
am
perfectly
clear
as
to
what
i
am
doing
and
my
own
motives
i
shall
be
after
all
he
added
perfectly
free
except
perhaps
outwardly
there
was
something
in
his
voice
i
got
to
my
feet
very
well
i
said
it
is
understood
that
we
are
both
free
except
perhaps
outwardly
i
do
not
think
he
liked
it
january
this
afternoon
at
four
i
was
married
to
william
denton
in
the
room
next
door
to
father
they
let
me
see
him
right
afterwards
and
he
put
his
dear
thin
white
hand
on
my
forehead
and
smiled
william
has
moved
over
to
the
house
to
be
near
father
and
after
the
grave
congratulations
of
our
few
friends
we
were
alone
together
in
the
quiet
house
married
and
as
far
apart
as
pole
from
pole
diary
you
who
have
guarded
my
girlhood
so
jealously
it
is
now
i
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
and
there
will
be
nothing
in
my
future
life
that
i
shall
want
to
record
there
is
only
this
uncle
john
brought
me
today
a
letter
from
richard
warren
i
opened
it
ten
minutes
ago
alone
in
my
room
it
was
a
short
letter
it
asked
if
he
might
come
to
me
it
said
that
he
had
loved
me
all
these
months
it
was
signed
your
lover
richard
warren
it
came
too
late
dear
diary
i
will
lay
it
among
your
pages
with
my
dreams
and
my
hopes
and
my
sorrow
with
a
very
steady
hand
i
by
some
mysterious
alchemy
of
the
law
and
the
church
william
denton
write
this
last
word
on
your
pages
chapter
viii
the
last
word
had
been
written
in
my
diary
wearily
i
stood
erect
and
brushed
the
loosened
hair
from
my
eyes
the
house
was
very
still
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
been
so
utterly
alone
i
turned
from
my
desk
and
as
i
did
so
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
face
in
the
that
was
not
i
that
girl
with
the
frightened
eyes
and
shaken
mouth
mavis
i
saw
the
mirrored
eyes
grow
dark
the
tremulous
mouth
straighten
into
lines
of
control
before
i
left
my
curiously
impersonal
scrutiny
of
myself
and
opened
the
door
for
my
husband
well
your
father
is
awake
said
bill
very
tall
and
on
the
threshold
i
have
been
trying
to
persuade
him
to
have
a
nurse
but
he
wo
listen
to
me
sarah
is
better
than
any
hospital
graduate
i
answered
and
i
am
quite
strong
enough
to
be
with
him
now
as
you
wish
he
answered
gently
but
i
think
you
your
strength
my
dear
i
walked
past
him
into
the
hall
sarah
has
prepared
the
guest
room
for
you
i
said
it
is
next
door
to
father
thank
you
he
walked
with
me
to
the
door
of
the
stood
aside
and
let
me
enter
alone
father
was
still
conscious
he
knew
me
tried
to
raise
his
hand
i
put
mine
over
it
and
sat
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
by
his
bed
sometimes
he
seemed
to
sleep
and
i
watched
him
with
a
passion
of
sorrow
and
love
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
known
all
his
defences
were
down
all
his
barriers
of
reserve
he
was
like
a
child
and
i
thought
quietly
happy
and
at
peace
it
is
difficult
to
set
down
on
paper
how
i
yearned
over
him
as
the
slow
hours
dragged
by
but
when
sarah
came
to
relieve
me
and
i
rose
stiff
and
cramped
from
long
sitting
i
was
conscious
that
somehow
i
had
come
to
grips
with
myself
had
seen
for
the
first
time
what
i
owed
to
my
father
had
realized
fully
his
sacrifice
and
his
unfailing
thought
of
me
it
was
as
if
we
had
talked
together
we
two
a
long
intimate
hour
and
i
knew
then
as
never
before
that
i
owed
him
not
duty
nor
obedience
for
those
are
unloving
words
but
tenderness
and
endless
gratitude
if
before
he
left
me
forever
my
marriage
was
the
one
thing
to
bring
him
peace
then
no
matter
how
mistaken
his
love
for
me
had
been
in
that
instance
i
had
been
more
than
right
to
do
for
him
as
he
wished
the
fact
that
in
so
doing
i
had
probably
ruined
two
lives
was
of
minor
consideration
two
days
went
by
on
the
evening
of
the
second
the
doctors
held
out
very
little
hope
that
my
father
would
live
through
the
night
i
watched
with
them
until
morning
i
had
no
tears
left
i
had
come
to
a
place
where
no
tears
were
a
place
too
deep
to
be
stirred
by
emotion
or
even
grief
as
the
dawn
came
in
pale
and
cold
mcallister
turned
from
the
bed
and
took
his
hand
from
father
wrist
he
looked
old
and
grey
dear
doctor
mac
but
his
eyes
were
radiant
he
pull
through
he
said
simply
all
about
me
was
a
singing
darkness
through
it
i
heard
a
voice
say
sharply
look
to
the
lassie
bill
and
felt
strong
arms
around
me
before
i
lost
complete
consciousness
i
remember
putting
up
my
hand
to
brush
something
wet
from
my
face
tears
not
tears
do
cry
i
said
childishly
it
hurts
father
to
see
people
cry
when
i
woke
again
it
was
bright
daylight
i
was
in
my
own
room
on
my
own
bed
my
husband
was
sitting
his
hands
between
his
knees
beside
me
for
a
moment
i
stared
at
him
then
as
knowledge
flashed
through
me
like
a
terrifying
tide
father
i
questioned
very
low
he
all
right
mavis
said
denton
quietly
the
danger
is
past
thank
god
i
put
out
my
hand
gropingly
and
he
took
it
firmly
into
his
cry
now
he
said
gently
it
will
help
then
in
a
rush
came
the
healing
tears
it
was
not
until
ten
days
later
when
father
marvellously
recuperating
sat
up
for
the
first
time
and
demanded
his
children
about
him
that
i
faced
the
fact
that
what
was
done
could
not
be
undone
and
that
i
was
confronted
by
the
finality
of
marriage
well
you
two
said
father
weakly
but
with
a
tiny
glimmer
of
mischief
in
his
eyes
it
looks
as
if
i
had
hurried
you
before
the
altar
under
false
pretences
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
now
that
i
fooled
you
by
living
beneath
his
i
heard
a
note
of
anxiety
of
doubt
and
the
resolution
rose
up
strong
and
compelling
within
me
that
never
as
long
as
i
lived
should
father
know
what
he
had
done
it
was
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
pay
my
debt
play
the
game
mavis
i
said
to
myself
and
smiled
straight
into
father
eyes
bill
sitting
beside
me
drew
a
long
breath
was
it
relief
i
glanced
at
him
quickly
and
knew
that
for
one
moment
we
agreed
you
old
matchmaker
i
said
were
you
so
afraid
that
i
would
never
find
a
husband
was
it
quite
necessary
to
frighten
us
all
to
pieces
in
order
that
i
should
wear
a
wedding
ring
father
laughed
then
he
asked
it
all
right
with
you
two
i
turned
to
bill
and
saw
him
nod
once
before
i
spoke
it
all
right
i
said
and
we
all
happy
thank
god
said
father
under
his
breath
i
could
not
bear
the
look
on
his
face
and
slipped
blindly
without
excuse
from
the
room
it
was
the
following
week
that
john
denton
came
down
to
be
with
us
and
hatched
his
plans
with
father
they
called
us
in
bill
and
me
and
laid
their
schemes
before
us
we
have
decided
said
father
very
thin
and
pale
in
his
armchair
that
children
are
best
left
alone
without
old
people
to
disturb
them
i
quite
all
right
in
two
weeks
i
shall
be
younger
and
better
than
i
have
been
in
twenty
years
and
i
want
you
and
bill
to
go
away
mavis
it
time
you
had
your
honeymoon
cloudless
and
solitary
as
all
honeymoons
should
be
old
john
here
has
been
talking
his
camp
in
canada
to
me
for
an
hour
steady
and
i
persuaded
i
get
you
infants
out
of
the
house
and
then
john
and
i
and
that
marvelous
of
his
who
is
cook
and
nurse
and
valet
in
one
person
will
travel
by
easy
stages
and
spend
a
month
rusticating
in
the
big
woods
ca
we
go
too
i
begged
in
a
sudden
panic
you
can
said
uncle
john
and
father
in
one
breath
i
turned
a
little
helplessly
to
my
husband
they
do
want
us
i
said
and
we
do
want
them
he
answered
smiling
you
and
i
are
going
to
cuba
just
as
soon
as
you
can
get
ready
i
been
talking
to
your
father
and
he
agrees
with
me
that
the
absolute
change
will
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
cuba
exactly
there
is
a
perfectly
good
plantation
there
just
waiting
for
us
but
i
said
sparring
for
time
i
could
leave
sarah
father
laughed
outright
you
baby
he
said
caressingly
you
wo
have
to
said
bill
she
needs
a
rest
as
much
as
you
do
she
coming
along
and
so
is
your
friend
peter
we
ca
leave
him
behind
and
goodrich
has
to
sail
for
spain
sooner
than
he
expected
i
saw
him
this
morning
i
was
too
amazed
for
words
and
over
my
defenceless
head
the
affair
was
settled
canada
for
father
and
uncle
john
cuba
for
sarah
peter
bill
and
me
a
thousand
protests
the
old
rebellious
anger
at
having
my
life
settled
and
ordered
for
me
rushed
over
me
again
but
eyes
were
on
me
and
i
choked
back
my
resentment
cuba
it
is
i
said
forcing
a
smile
and
so
after
the
maze
of
packing
of
sending
sarah
to
new
york
for
summer
clothes
in
the
dead
of
winter
after
the
farewells
and
the
blessings
and
the
hurry
and
bustle
cuba
it
was
chapter
ix
it
was
decided
that
my
husband
and
i
should
go
to
new
york
by
motor
spending
the
night
with
his
uncle
peter
and
sarah
to
join
us
the
following
day
so
that
the
last
packing
could
be
leisurely
attended
to
before
we
sailed
i
had
my
farewells
with
father
alone
denton
went
in
first
and
came
out
looking
more
moved
than
i
believed
possible
if
i
could
have
liked
him
at
all
it
would
have
been
for
his
devotion
to
my
father
i
ca
write
about
how
dear
father
was
when
he
told
me
john
denton
went
up
to
town
with
us
i
begged
him
to
and
he
very
naturally
attributed
my
nervousness
and
pallor
to
the
long
strain
of
my
father
illness
he
was
very
good
to
me
leaving
my
house
in
a
sense
for
the
first
time
and
knowing
it
would
be
months
before
i
saw
it
again
i
experienced
a
sinking
of
the
heart
that
was
terrible
not
till
then
had
i
realized
how
much
my
home
meant
to
me
how
much
freedom
had
been
mine
beneath
it
little
roof
how
lovingly
the
friendly
walls
had
safeguarded
and
sheltered
me
at
the
door
i
clung
first
to
goodrich
and
then
for
a
long
close
moment
to
sarah
she
seemed
a
rock
of
strength
the
last
familiar
landmark
but
strong
hands
drew
me
away
from
her
and
presently
i
was
in
the
closed
car
and
we
were
off
for
new
york
i
had
very
little
sensation
only
a
feeling
of
great
numbness
and
a
consciousness
that
if
i
could
know
any
emotion
it
would
be
that
of
an
infinite
despair
i
was
dimly
grateful
that
i
need
not
go
by
train
in
this
at
least
they
had
humored
me
all
through
the
long
ride
i
sat
huddled
in
the
new
furs
which
were
uncle
john
wedding
gift
to
me
my
eyes
closed
and
my
hand
in
john
denton
warm
clasp
i
did
not
hear
what
the
two
men
said
to
one
another
possibly
when
they
spoke
to
me
i
answered
i
do
not
know
something
of
the
terrifying
maelstrom
of
the
city
traffic
penetrated
my
stupor
as
we
came
smoothly
into
town
it
was
all
so
new
the
noise
and
rush
and
bewilderment
of
it
the
lights
were
beginning
to
flare
up
all
about
me
faces
seen
in
the
crowds
struck
at
me
like
a
blow
such
hungry
restless
seeking
faces
but
here
and
there
the
happy
eyes
of
a
girl
clinging
to
a
man
arm
or
walking
alone
with
her
dreams
stood
out
for
me
and
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
wearily
i
thought
if
i
could
only
cry
again
for
it
seemed
so
long
since
i
had
known
the
release
of
tears
i
must
have
fainted
when
we
reached
the
house
for
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
waking
up
in
a
great
wide
bed
in
a
huge
room
with
a
kindly
round
old
woman
fussing
over
me
you
to
lie
still
dearie
she
said
as
i
tried
to
sit
up
and
have
a
bite
of
supper
on
a
tray
is
the
doctor
orders
and
she
smiled
at
me
with
a
certain
shy
sweetness
and
tucked
a
billowy
eiderdown
quilt
more
closely
about
my
feet
i
discovered
then
that
i
was
undressed
and
surrounded
by
bottles
i
tried
to
thank
her
but
words
were
difficult
i
was
so
very
tired
someone
knocked
it
himself
surely
said
the
old
woman
as
she
hastened
to
open
and
then
stood
aside
her
hands
beneath
her
apron
to
let
my
husband
come
in
he
thanked
her
dismissed
her
and
came
straight
to
my
bedside
where
he
stood
looking
down
at
me
i
drew
the
clothes
tight
about
my
throat
and
looked
at
him
mutely
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
retrieving
one
of
my
submerged
hands
and
placing
a
steady
finger
on
the
pulse
tired
i
answered
and
then
oh
doctor
denton
when
will
sarah
be
here
i
knew
quite
well
but
something
unreasonable
in
me
hoped
that
i
had
slept
a
whole
hours
away
and
that
i
would
very
soon
hear
her
comforting
step
outside
my
door
tomorrow
he
answered
and
added
with
a
suspicion
of
a
smile
but
i
thought
we
were
agreed
that
doctor
denton
as
a
form
of
address
is
taboo
under
the
circumstances
william
then
i
said
with
a
great
weariness
in
my
heart
could
you
manage
bill
he
asked
i
have
unpleasant
associations
with
my
full
name
it
always
reminds
me
of
the
woodshed
and
my
father
strong
right
hand
absurdly
enough
i
heard
my
own
voice
saying
solemnly
father
called
me
william
mother
called
me
will
sister
called
me
willie
but
the
fellers
called
me
bill
i
stopped
suddenly
wondering
if
i
were
going
quite
mad
but
there
was
reassuring
laughter
in
the
eyes
bent
upon
me
exactly
he
said
gravely
i
attempted
to
laugh
it
was
a
very
poor
effort
and
ended
in
tears
denton
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
took
me
into
his
arms
pressing
my
head
against
his
shoulder
i
did
care
i
cried
there
very
comfortably
for
a
long
time
it
all
right
i
heard
his
voice
saying
coming
so
it
seemed
from
a
great
distance
it
all
right
you
feel
lots
better
for
it
mavis
after
a
while
i
dried
my
eyes
and
lay
back
against
the
pillows
again
the
intolerable
burden
about
my
heart
had
eased
a
little
in
some
miraculous
manner
and
now
announced
my
husband
cardigan
is
going
to
bring
you
some
supper
after
that
she
will
make
you
comfortable
for
the
night
and
you
are
to
drink
what
i
send
you
uncle
john
sends
his
love
and
the
demand
that
you
pour
his
coffee
for
him
in
the
morning
or
if
you
do
not
feel
strong
enough
you
are
to
stay
in
bed
he
says
and
he
will
come
up
and
pour
yours
and
i
shall
be
next
door
to
you
if
you
want
anything
in
the
night
but
i
am
sure
that
you
are
going
to
sleep
soundly
he
rose
and
looked
down
on
me
once
more
good
night
he
said
sleep
well
good
night
i
answered
his
eyes
twinkled
just
for
a
moment
good
night
he
responded
miss
he
opened
the
door
for
cardigan
and
her
tray
stood
aside
waved
to
me
once
and
was
gone
all
the
way
down
the
hall
i
heard
him
singing
you
are
old
father
william
in
a
pleasant
gay
baritone
suddenly
i
realized
i
was
hungry
i
awoke
the
following
morning
feeling
almost
happy
there
was
a
wonderful
sense
of
adventure
in
looking
out
of
my
windows
over
the
grey
city
streets
in
hearing
the
hurrying
footsteps
go
past
me
so
many
people
so
many
sorrows
and
joys
passing
beneath
my
window
so
many
eager
feet
going
out
to
meet
the
day
i
felt
very
small
almost
insignificant
very
unimportant
it
like
an
angel
you
looking
today
mrs
denton
said
cardigan
amiably
as
she
brought
me
my
breakfast
with
uncle
john
following
hard
on
her
heels
and
it
blushing
she
is
added
the
honest
creature
in
amazement
uncle
john
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
old
woman
who
had
been
nurse
and
housekeeper
and
to
him
for
thirty
years
run
off
with
you
mary
he
said
laughing
denton
is
used
to
blarney
and
her
with
the
fine
young
husband
said
cardigan
in
obvious
astonishment
as
she
backed
to
the
door
uncle
john
looked
at
me
with
laughing
eyes
but
i
could
not
meet
his
glance
the
rest
of
the
day
is
more
or
less
of
a
blur
to
me
now
sarah
came
with
peter
and
wiggles
it
was
a
matter
for
debate
which
of
the
two
last
mentioned
was
the
more
excited
but
it
is
certain
that
peter
talked
more
his
ideas
of
cuba
were
wonderful
and
strange
and
it
was
only
by
dint
of
dire
threats
of
being
left
on
the
dock
that
we
finally
persuaded
him
to
go
to
bed
the
following
morning
february
tenth
with
the
thermometer
flirting
with
zero
we
sailed
for
cuba
sarah
and
i
had
connecting
cabins
and
i
bribed
a
blonde
friendly
steward
to
let
me
conceal
wiggles
behind
locked
doors
and
thus
keep
him
with
us
on
the
other
side
of
me
denton
was
housed
with
peter
all
the
cabins
were
full
of
flowers
and
fruit
and
books
and
i
am
sure
that
although
i
may
have
concealed
it
better
i
was
quite
as
excited
as
peter
and
the
pup
it
was
they
tell
me
a
rough
passage
somehow
i
did
seem
to
mind
to
lie
in
a
muffled
to
the
eyes
and
to
watch
the
ocean
seemed
all
that
i
wanted
in
life
i
never
tired
of
it
grey
and
green
and
blue
as
the
fog
or
the
sun
caught
it
there
was
never
anything
as
wonderful
as
my
first
sight
of
the
sea
i
was
even
glad
of
the
storms
that
delayed
us
longer
than
usual
for
even
beyond
cape
hatteras
we
had
wind
and
snow
and
cold
and
then
came
a
day
when
little
by
little
people
began
to
crawl
greenly
up
from
their
cabins
shed
their
sweaters
and
take
an
interest
in
life
sarah
among
them
poor
dear
she
had
succumbed
almost
before
we
left
the
dock
every
dip
of
the
boat
every
rising
and
falling
swell
was
met
by
her
with
the
gloomy
announcement
that
she
wanted
to
die
once
when
i
peered
in
at
her
i
found
my
husband
sitting
by
her
berth
and
answering
quite
gravely
her
innumerable
questions
as
to
how
they
conducted
burials
at
sea
were
they
conducted
with
decent
christian
rites
she
was
demanding
weakly
as
i
walked
the
deck
with
him
braced
against
the
salt
wind
my
hair
flying
under
my
fur
cap
you
should
tease
sarah
i
said
indignantly
should
i
he
asked
forcibly
restraining
peter
from
going
over
the
rail
shouting
i
see
a
mermaid
aunt
mavis
perhaps
not
but
to
the
good
sailor
seasickness
is
always
a
matter
inexplicable
and
humorous
by
the
way
i
glad
he
continued
that
you
stood
the
trip
so
well
it
would
be
a
pity
said
he
pensively
to
have
injected
into
the
romance
of
a
honeymoon
the
very
mundane
element
of
i
turned
on
my
heel
to
leave
him
but
reckoned
without
the
tremendous
wave
which
swung
lazily
up
to
the
boat
smote
it
held
it
suspended
a
breathless
moment
and
then
let
it
down
again
with
unparalleled
suddenness
my
husband
arm
intervened
between
me
and
the
rail
checking
my
mad
career
in
steady
on
he
said
we
not
reached
tropical
waters
yet
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
take
his
proffered
arm
and
walk
on
in
haughty
silence
we
sat
at
the
captain
table
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
trip
we
and
the
captain
sat
there
alone
no
not
quite
alone
for
at
the
captain
right
sat
the
prettiest
girl
i
have
ever
seen
we
met
her
the
first
day
out
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
had
attached
herself
to
our
party
peter
always
susceptible
to
beauty
caused
me
not
a
few
pangs
of
jealousy
before
the
trip
was
over
and
miss
mercedes
howell
for
such
was
her
mismated
name
seemed
to
find
much
in
common
with
my
husband
she
had
thought
at
first
she
confided
to
me
naïvely
that
the
doctor
and
i
must
be
brother
and
sister
despite
the
passenger
list
and
at
all
events
we
must
have
been
married
a
long
long
time
was
it
not
so
dear
denton
on
my
stately
assurance
that
i
had
been
married
less
than
a
week
her
enormous
black
eyes
flew
open
to
their
widest
i
changed
the
subject
miss
howell
so
her
vivacious
chatter
informed
us
was
returning
to
havana
after
a
period
of
college
i
gathered
that
by
the
edict
of
the
faculty
she
had
gone
through
vassar
in
two
years
instead
of
the
prescribed
four
oh
but
it
was
dull
she
told
us
at
the
table
with
melting
melancholy
eyes
no
young
men
nothing
just
stupid
books
and
rules
rules
rules
it
was
like
prison
imagine
and
she
looked
brightly
about
the
board
for
sympathy
if
i
had
a
momentary
sense
of
sympathy
it
was
for
the
faculty
but
evidently
my
husband
and
the
captain
felt
otherwise
mercedes
as
she
insisted
i
should
call
her
extending
the
courtesy
to
the
entire
family
and
as
a
matter
of
course
addressing
me
as
mavis
and
the
remainder
of
the
party
as
peter
and
bill
was
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
american
settled
in
cuba
with
a
spanish
wife
she
was
twenty
and
on
returning
to
cuba
was
to
make
her
debut
i
was
tremendously
interested
by
her
vivid
account
of
cuban
society
and
went
to
bed
each
night
with
my
head
a
whirl
of
horse
races
and
parties
and
country
clubs
and
motor
trips
her
chaperone
being
confined
to
her
cabin
mercedes
found
that
after
i
had
retired
it
was
quite
providential
that
she
should
keep
billy
pleasantly
occupied
on
deck
until
such
time
as
she
should
elect
to
go
to
bed
i
must
say
that
my
husband
advanced
no
serious
objections
and
when
we
parted
on
the
docks
at
havana
mercedes
escaped
from
her
wan
and
weary
attendant
long
enough
to
assure
us
all
of
her
undying
affection
and
to
impart
to
us
the
pleasing
information
that
guayabal
whither
we
were
bound
was
quite
near
havana
and
that
we
could
expect
to
see
her
often
i
am
afraid
i
was
not
very
cordial
she
was
rather
a
dear
and
superlatively
almost
superfluously
pretty
but
she
made
my
head
ache
and
beside
her
youth
and
effervescence
i
felt
curiously
old
entering
the
harbor
was
something
i
shall
never
forget
the
blue
water
and
the
sun
on
the
white
and
mauve
and
pink
houses
and
the
shining
fortress
of
morro
castle
rising
up
from
the
bay
bill
told
me
something
of
its
history
as
we
leaned
over
the
rail
and
watched
the
approach
and
a
sense
of
horror
took
hold
of
me
in
the
warmth
and
sunlight
as
i
thought
of
the
torture
chamber
and
the
silenced
screams
of
the
prisoners
and
that
is
why
i
suppose
my
first
impression
of
cuba
was
one
of
beauty
and
cruelty
warmth
and
color
and
the
dark
swift
treachery
of
ages
the
landing
the
inspection
the
docks
passed
in
a
blur
sarah
pale
and
miserable
sat
on
a
trunk
with
peter
and
watched
her
alien
surroundings
with
unfriendly
eyes
but
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
hustled
away
and
into
a
long
luxurious
open
car
driven
by
a
lean
person
who
greeted
us
in
an
unmistakable
yankee
twang
bless
him
and
seemed
unfeignedly
glad
to
see
us
this
is
silas
mavis
my
husband
informed
me
chauffeur
extraordinary
and
to
my
friend
harry
reynolds
and
this
silas
he
said
quite
impressively
is
mrs
denton
i
shook
hands
and
presented
sarah
who
brightened
visibly
at
the
and
after
we
were
settled
with
peter
and
wiggles
and
innumerable
bags
stowed
in
the
front
seat
with
silas
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
watched
havana
slide
by
gay
with
color
its
narrow
streets
crowded
under
a
heavenly
blue
sky
we
ran
along
the
low
and
passing
parks
and
wonderful
stone
edifices
which
seemed
too
to
be
called
houses
we
were
soon
leaving
the
outskirts
far
behind
us
before
us
stretched
a
long
wide
white
road
thick
with
fine
sharp
dust
we
climbing
said
my
husband
you
notice
the
change
of
air
soon
for
guayabal
is
in
a
mountain
district
i
hardly
heard
him
i
was
too
busy
watching
the
various
family
groups
as
we
went
through
the
villages
it
was
all
so
incongruous
here
a
marvellous
house
that
might
have
belonged
to
some
foreign
prince
there
huddled
at
its
very
gate
a
cluster
of
huts
thatched
and
and
brown
babies
all
over
the
landscape
very
naked
very
dirty
and
from
a
distance
at
least
wholly
enchanting
and
then
the
trees
the
tall
royal
palms
with
the
afternoon
wind
in
them
i
said
as
we
passed
a
clump
of
wonderful
scarlet
blossoms
what
is
it
sarah
was
exclaiming
too
sitting
perfectly
upright
and
rigid
beside
me
hibiscus
answered
our
companion
you
find
lots
of
it
where
we
are
going
the
villages
went
by
a
crimson
sun
was
glowing
over
the
palms
and
almost
before
i
had
seen
it
it
was
gone
and
a
violet
was
coloring
distant
hilltops
i
clasped
my
hands
in
my
lap
and
wondered
if
ever
there
had
been
anything
as
lovely
and
remote
and
it
was
with
a
sense
of
absolute
shock
that
i
heard
and
saw
silas
snap
on
the
lights
of
the
car
and
realized
that
now
the
had
gone
and
that
the
heavy
southern
night
had
closed
in
around
us
why
there
is
any
twilight
i
said
in
childish
disappointment
not
here
answered
my
husband
nature
strikes
suddenly
and
swiftly
in
the
tropics
she
has
no
halftones
no
compromise
even
in
the
dark
i
could
feel
his
glance
at
me
i
said
nothing
when
we
entered
the
village
of
guayabal
and
drove
up
the
winding
roadway
through
the
gates
and
into
the
drive
the
stars
were
shining
very
close
they
seemed
and
tremendous
as
big
as
dinner
plates
as
sarah
put
it
to
me
afterwards
with
obvious
disapproval
and
they
were
warm
almost
fragrant
i
fancied
unlike
our
cold
high
impersonal
stars
of
the
north
they
frightened
me
the
lights
shone
out
from
a
low
long
house
as
the
car
stopped
under
a
portico
two
smiling
chinese
housemen
were
standing
ready
to
take
our
bags
and
my
heart
sank
as
i
thought
of
what
sarah
who
contributes
so
religiously
to
foreign
missions
must
be
thinking
it
was
with
relief
therefore
that
i
saw
the
unmistakable
hibernian
face
of
the
cook
at
the
door
the
domestic
staff
consisted
then
of
wing
and
fong
and
norah
and
i
blessed
the
reynolds
that
in
assembling
their
household
lares
and
penates
they
had
included
something
white
and
clean
and
very
cordial
to
preside
over
the
kitchen
for
i
feared
for
peace
of
mind
peter
tired
and
perhaps
somewhat
frightened
by
the
strangeness
and
by
the
yellow
hands
raised
to
lift
him
down
from
the
car
whimpered
a
little
and
my
husband
jumping
out
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
turned
to
me
welcome
he
said
with
a
certain
dignity
to
the
palms
it
was
the
loveliest
house
even
sarah
was
moved
to
favorable
comment
and
wiggles
went
quite
mad
we
entered
through
a
screened
verandah
and
bright
with
to
an
enormous
room
the
walls
were
panelled
in
dark
wood
the
floor
the
ceiling
raftered
and
it
was
wide
and
high
and
long
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
of
any
room
there
were
tables
and
books
and
myriad
comfortable
chairs
all
about
and
at
the
far
end
a
huge
fireplace
wherein
a
little
red
fire
burned
comfortably
for
as
the
night
came
so
came
the
sudden
amazing
chill
after
the
day
heat
and
i
found
the
warmth
and
sight
of
the
fire
very
gratifying
the
room
was
living
and
dining
room
in
one
norah
explained
to
me
and
showed
me
hard
by
the
pantry
door
the
table
laid
for
two
and
after
my
first
curiosity
had
subsided
she
took
me
to
my
room
it
was
and
all
the
windows
were
barred
three
red
steps
led
up
to
the
alcove
where
a
great
bed
was
set
under
an
crucifix
and
it
was
gay
with
chintz
and
dimities
while
against
my
windows
a
bourginvilla
vine
whispered
in
the
wind
peter
and
sarah
were
next
door
with
a
bath
between
and
across
the
way
my
had
his
own
room
and
bath
as
big
and
odd
and
delightful
as
mine
i
could
hardly
sit
down
or
let
sarah
brush
my
hair
or
even
wash
the
dust
of
the
journey
from
me
for
excitement
peter
soon
undressed
and
sitting
up
in
bed
with
a
big
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
was
trying
heroically
to
keep
his
eyes
open
i
heard
his
prayer
answered
half
a
thousand
questions
as
best
i
could
left
him
sleeping
quietly
and
went
in
search
of
my
host
i
found
him
in
a
dinner
jacket
at
the
piano
playing
something
very
softly
and
with
his
eyes
when
he
heard
my
step
on
the
tiles
he
jumped
up
i
did
know
you
played
i
said
politely
glad
that
sarah
had
persuaded
me
to
change
and
conscious
of
how
very
becoming
the
new
mauve
voile
must
be
i
have
a
number
of
accomplishments
he
answered
irritatingly
i
stood
for
a
moment
by
the
fireplace
the
mantel
high
above
my
head
this
is
a
wonderful
house
i
said
trying
to
make
conversation
tell
me
something
about
it
denton
drew
two
big
chairs
close
to
the
fire
and
for
half
an
hour
told
me
of
his
friend
harry
reynolds
and
his
delicate
little
wife
of
how
they
had
come
to
cuba
and
built
this
place
of
dreams
and
sent
for
silas
from
vermont
to
come
and
take
care
of
it
it
is
only
about
a
hundred
acres
said
my
companion
mostly
in
sugar
cane
but
reynolds
has
plenty
of
money
and
they
were
very
happy
here
when
the
youngest
boy
died
of
fever
reynolds
stand
it
any
longer
the
place
had
too
many
associations
so
they
left
last
summer
keeping
the
servants
on
for
harry
had
to
make
several
flying
trips
back
and
forth
and
he
was
glad
to
let
us
have
the
house
for
a
time
until
he
decided
what
to
do
with
it
his
wife
swears
she
will
never
come
here
again
and
yet
they
are
reluctant
to
sell
it
i
have
spent
a
number
of
happy
holidays
here
and
so
well
it
was
all
most
opportune
and
providential
and
i
am
convinced
that
the
climate
will
be
admirable
for
you
he
was
speaking
in
his
professional
tone
and
i
nervous
and
was
glad
to
talk
of
my
returning
health
and
of
other
prosaic
matters
when
you
are
rested
he
said
in
a
day
or
two
we
must
go
into
havana
you
will
want
an
account
opened
there
at
one
of
the
banks
that
reminded
me
of
something
that
had
been
troubling
me
but
it
is
not
my
money
i
began
rather
abruptly
and
stopped
it
is
he
assured
me
your
father
has
been
very
generous
with
you
and
you
need
feel
under
no
obligations
to
me
unless
you
object
to
having
me
play
the
host
a
little
until
later
i
did
know
what
to
answer
and
blessed
fong
sleek
black
head
as
slippered
and
silent
he
slid
in
to
announce
dinner
norah
had
outdone
herself
for
the
new
missis
and
it
was
pleasant
in
the
softly
lighted
room
with
the
candles
burning
on
the
table
shining
across
delicate
old
china
and
worn
silver
my
husband
exerted
himself
to
be
amusing
our
talk
was
all
give
and
take
and
there
were
even
laughter
awaking
echoes
in
the
room
dinner
over
after
i
had
made
a
face
over
the
strong
cuban
and
bill
it
was
still
so
difficult
to
call
him
that
had
sent
out
word
to
norah
that
hereafter
we
would
drink
the
sort
of
beverage
i
had
been
accustomed
to
he
went
to
the
piano
again
and
with
a
little
pipe
between
his
teeth
sang
ridiculous
bab
ballads
and
played
enchanting
snatches
of
melody
while
with
wiggles
on
my
lap
i
dreamed
before
the
fire
father
would
have
loved
it
i
missed
him
terribly
the
music
stopped
mavis
he
was
beside
me
something
in
his
hand
i
turned
startled
i
did
give
you
a
wedding
present
he
said
but
before
we
left
i
had
just
time
to
have
this
made
for
you
i
took
the
small
black
leather
case
from
his
hand
and
opened
it
my
father
face
looked
back
at
me
wonderfully
living
almost
it
seemed
as
if
the
gentle
strong
mouth
would
smile
and
speak
i
had
it
painted
before
before
the
tide
turned
said
bill
from
the
picture
he
gave
me
i
closed
my
hands
upon
the
miniature
and
my
eyes
against
the
tears
you
are
very
good
i
said
falteringly
i
you
could
have
given
me
anything
i
could
have
cared
for
more
he
stood
his
broad
shoulders
squared
against
the
mantel
and
looked
at
me
gravely
i
hope
he
said
and
stopped
then
very
evenly
he
went
on
i
hope
you
will
try
to
be
happy
here
mavis
happy
a
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
came
over
me
what
use
had
i
for
happiness
i
had
been
almost
stupefied
like
an
animal
in
the
sun
dreaming
vaguely
before
the
fire
but
now
i
will
try
to
be
content
i
told
him
his
eyes
hardened
grew
keen
and
cold
again
thank
you
he
said
not
quite
sincerely
we
were
silent
a
moment
until
silas
came
in
to
get
the
orders
for
the
following
day
i
hardly
heard
the
voices
talking
so
near
me
it
mattered
so
little
what
they
or
anyone
said
i
thought
of
green
hill
of
peter
asleep
near
me
i
thought
of
father
in
his
big
woods
his
old
strength
coming
back
to
him
and
i
thought
of
the
letter
that
had
reached
me
on
my
wedding
day
my
first
love
letter
i
had
not
answered
it
for
me
no
lyric
hour
could
exist
no
nor
not
even
the
dream
of
one
uncle
john
i
thought
would
have
told
richard
warren
by
now
that
i
was
married
william
denton
my
thoughts
blurred
into
a
i
was
on
a
ship
somewhere
mercedes
howell
was
standing
i
heard
her
calling
from
far
off
billy
billy
i
awoke
suddenly
silas
had
gone
and
my
husband
was
standing
near
me
you
called
me
mavis
he
was
saying
i
looked
at
him
at
the
great
strange
room
confused
and
half
asleep
i
was
dreaming
i
said
and
then
a
nightmare
oh
i
see
he
laughed
a
little
you
look
like
a
child
he
said
slowly
with
the
firelight
on
your
yellow
hair
and
that
flush
in
your
cheeks
i
rose
tumbling
wiggles
unceremoniously
to
the
floor
i
said
he
answered
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
then
as
i
turned
sleep
well
my
little
chapter
x
i
had
been
asleep
for
several
hours
i
fancy
that
first
night
in
cuba
when
i
awoke
to
see
the
moonlight
like
a
living
presence
in
my
room
across
the
floor
it
lay
in
long
level
bars
of
light
not
the
iron
barriers
at
my
window
could
keep
it
out
silver
it
was
and
never
still
but
quivering
as
if
a
heart
shook
it
the
scent
of
flowers
came
to
me
and
far
off
in
what
was
probably
the
native
quarter
i
heard
a
throbbing
instrument
touched
very
softly
and
the
sound
of
singing
it
was
all
so
strange
i
could
scarcely
believe
myself
awake
and
presently
in
nightgown
and
bare
feet
i
went
across
the
cool
tiles
to
the
windows
and
looked
out
the
earth
was
silver
under
my
eyes
and
the
tall
palms
delicately
feathered
with
light
the
singing
died
away
to
half
a
sob
the
smell
of
growing
things
was
heavy
and
sweet
on
the
air
it
was
all
sheer
beauty
a
little
song
began
to
weave
itself
in
my
brain
i
had
made
songs
before
almost
too
shy
to
set
down
on
paper
they
were
but
here
in
cuba
where
everything
seemed
softness
and
release
i
wondered
if
perhaps
i
could
not
sing
with
a
stronger
voice
and
shape
my
songs
with
pen
and
ink
what
was
it
richard
warren
had
said
about
poets
and
then
suddenly
i
knew
that
it
was
the
thought
of
him
which
had
taken
me
out
of
sleep
and
sent
me
trembling
to
the
window
with
my
breast
bare
to
the
wonderful
night
i
knew
that
once
and
for
all
all
beauty
must
be
inextricably
woven
with
the
thought
of
him
who
had
signed
himself
my
lover
it
was
then
that
i
became
aware
that
something
was
hurting
me
cruelly
something
cold
and
hard
and
forbidding
i
crept
back
to
bed
with
the
marks
of
the
bars
across
my
breast
in
the
morning
i
woke
to
find
peter
sitting
crosslegged
on
my
bed
saying
solemnly
they
blue
they
grey
no
they
open
and
they
brown
wide
awake
now
i
caught
him
to
me
cuddled
him
close
and
then
asked
wildly
peter
what
that
not
far
from
my
window
a
raucous
voice
was
saying
bring
me
my
coffee
coffee
norah
hurry
up
perhaps
it
uncle
bill
said
peter
of
course
it
is
peter
i
said
quite
crossly
and
climbed
out
of
bed
from
my
window
in
the
full
dazzling
sunlight
i
could
see
where
the
kitchen
made
an
l
and
the
screened
kitchen
porch
from
which
that
terrifying
voice
emanated
hurry
it
was
saying
gol
dern
coffee
coffee
why
peter
i
cried
it
a
macaw
a
beauty
i
never
seen
one
before
only
pictures
hurry
and
get
dressed
and
let
go
out
and
say
to
him
sarah
apparently
at
home
and
certainly
composed
but
rather
too
communicative
as
to
the
habits
of
heathen
appeared
to
help
me
dress
and
to
hustle
peter
into
his
own
room
but
before
i
was
ready
a
knock
came
at
the
door
and
on
its
heels
norah
bearing
fragrant
coffee
and
hot
brown
rolls
good
morning
and
it
never
ye
are
she
said
in
astonishment
setting
the
tray
down
on
a
little
table
which
she
spread
with
a
white
cloth
does
one
get
up
in
cuba
i
asked
laughing
as
in
a
negligée
i
sat
down
to
my
breakfast
not
yet
she
answered
it
coffee
ye
have
in
bed
and
then
at
a
real
big
tea
at
four
and
at
eight
unless
ye
rather
it
was
different
she
added
hastily
not
at
all
i
assured
her
i
think
it
a
delightful
arrangement
when
in
cuba
i
began
gaily
smoke
cubebs
finished
another
voice
and
my
husband
dark
head
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
good
morning
mavis
how
did
you
sleep
beautifully
i
told
him
just
a
little
bit
embarrassed
as
his
tall
bathrobed
figure
wandered
unconcernedly
in
another
cup
he
said
to
norah
with
a
at
me
and
a
careless
with
your
permission
i
nodded
i
could
very
well
do
anything
else
with
sarah
there
and
norah
beaming
and
peter
dashing
in
to
shriek
loudly
for
milk
in
the
general
tumult
the
macaw
had
started
again
norah
it
squawked
coffee
coffee
for
heaven
sake
i
said
what
sophisticated
sort
of
a
bird
is
that
that
arthur
said
norah
proudly
and
disappeared
later
i
left
bill
and
peter
exchanging
pleasantries
over
the
breakfast
table
and
went
to
the
kitchen
porch
to
watch
arthur
being
fed
bread
lavishly
sopped
in
coffee
from
a
spoon
he
was
an
utterly
gorgeous
bird
yellow
and
blue
and
a
great
talker
as
norah
informed
me
me
however
he
regarded
for
some
time
with
a
glassy
eye
and
merely
reiterated
his
desire
for
strong
drink
returning
i
found
my
room
empty
and
closing
the
door
proceeded
with
mixed
emotions
to
dress
last
night
the
moonlight
and
the
surge
of
regret
and
longing
which
had
threatened
to
drown
me
seemed
very
far
away
and
it
was
mentally
on
that
i
joined
a
white
flannelled
bill
for
my
first
stroll
about
my
temporary
domain
we
were
alone
peter
having
long
since
appropriated
the
services
of
silas
and
gone
forth
with
him
to
view
the
country
the
sun
was
very
hot
and
i
tilted
my
parasol
low
over
my
face
through
avenues
of
palms
we
walked
to
the
big
garage
and
on
to
the
little
orange
grove
behind
the
beyond
the
cane
fields
stretched
green
and
tall
and
waving
figures
stunted
wiry
moved
in
the
fields
far
off
i
saw
a
patient
donkey
stand
his
back
loaded
with
long
lengths
of
cane
tips
it
was
all
hot
and
still
and
unreal
to
look
at
silas
peter
and
one
of
the
natives
came
toward
us
peter
rapt
at
the
tremendous
flow
of
which
surged
above
his
small
blonde
head
they
stopped
to
speak
to
us
bill
growing
suddenly
foreign
and
gesticulating
as
he
answered
the
bent
brown
man
greetings
that
juan
he
told
me
as
we
moved
off
great
old
character
he
has
a
daughter
whom
he
adores
a
girl
who
must
be
sixteen
now
i
should
judge
he
used
to
beat
her
unmercifully
horrible
creature
i
said
with
a
shudder
my
mind
flashing
back
to
that
beautiful
sinister
fortress
rising
towered
from
the
sea
a
symbol
and
a
reminder
bill
pushed
his
panama
back
from
his
broad
forehead
and
whistled
i
do
know
he
said
thoughtfully
after
all
he
beat
her
to
keep
her
good
a
peacock
tail
unfurled
minced
colorfully
toward
us
down
the
white
pathway
to
keep
her
good
i
repeated
scornfully
with
whipping
i
not
advocating
it
he
answered
quickly
but
his
motives
are
unquestionably
admirable
and
there
a
spanish
proverb
you
may
recall
it
runs
tersely
woman
a
dog
and
a
the
more
you
beat
them
the
better
they
be
wiggles
his
eyes
on
the
stately
departing
peacock
pranced
down
the
path
toward
us
and
deflected
by
my
whistle
from
his
original
doubtless
destructive
purpose
leaped
gaily
at
my
ruffles
did
you
hear
that
wiggles
i
asked
him
this
is
decidedly
no
place
for
you
but
wiggles
rolling
happily
in
the
grass
merely
snorted
a
gong
sounded
from
the
house
and
we
went
in
to
lunch
about
two
i
was
attacked
by
an
overpowering
languor
twice
no
less
i
yawned
in
peter
face
in
the
midst
of
his
thrilling
description
of
babies
an
ladies
an
gentlemen
all
brown
aunt
mavis
siesta
now
remarked
my
husband
briskly
both
of
you
off
to
bed
bed
i
said
in
the
middle
of
the
day
peter
but
recently
released
from
the
burden
of
an
afternoon
nap
protested
custom
of
the
country
said
bill
no
getting
around
it
could
if
you
wanted
to
even
arthur
is
asleep
i
listened
we
were
on
the
verandah
and
all
about
us
was
a
stillness
which
was
almost
audible
on
the
white
road
beyond
our
gates
i
saw
a
pair
of
oxen
toiling
patiently
up
the
hill
even
the
birds
were
quiet
only
now
and
then
a
sleepy
chirping
drifted
down
the
hot
air
it
seemed
as
if
a
veil
had
been
drawn
over
the
land
my
eyelids
felt
freighted
and
i
was
very
tired
bed
said
bill
firmly
i
left
peter
to
his
tender
mercies
and
went
indoors
my
room
was
cool
and
sweet
with
flower
perfume
sarah
yawning
came
when
i
rang
and
unhooked
my
frock
as
i
lay
down
on
the
bed
i
heard
her
say
something
bitterly
about
an
unhealthy
climate
but
if
she
said
more
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
for
i
was
fast
and
dreamlessly
asleep
it
was
arthur
who
woke
me
making
the
day
hideous
with
his
laughter
mother
darling
he
announced
unctuously
pretty
arthur
arthur
arthur
i
turned
over
and
felt
for
my
watch
four
it
was
incredible
and
equally
beyond
belief
the
fact
that
i
was
hungry
again
i
bathed
and
dressed
and
then
wonderfully
rested
went
out
on
the
verandah
fong
and
wing
appeared
as
if
by
magic
and
laid
the
with
iced
tea
tiny
round
tomato
sandwiches
and
delectable
frosted
cakes
and
also
as
if
answering
some
compelling
summons
peter
and
strolled
out
from
the
direction
of
room
it
was
quite
apparent
that
both
of
them
had
been
asleep
tea
i
asked
my
husband
as
his
tall
figure
loomed
up
behind
peter
certainly
he
said
it
a
necessity
in
cuba
not
a
mere
excuse
for
sociability
all
about
us
the
birds
were
singing
again
and
the
palms
looked
new
washed
it
looks
as
if
it
had
rained
i
said
in
amazement
probably
has
said
bill
lazily
often
does
afternoons
what
a
country
that
night
i
made
my
first
little
song
there
was
a
thought
somewhere
back
in
my
brain
a
thought
of
moonlight
and
bars
and
a
singing
but
it
was
not
clear
yet
so
instead
i
set
to
paper
the
first
eight
lines
that
cuba
had
made
for
me
the
palms
are
listening
to
pan
across
the
terrace
of
the
night
a
aloof
and
white
spreads
wide
a
silver
fan
the
gilded
stars
with
laughter
pass
for
i
have
caught
an
eerie
sound
the
peacock
droops
just
now
i
found
a
silver
feather
in
the
grass
and
so
the
days
passed
in
blur
of
color
and
scent
of
sun
and
sleep
peter
grew
tanned
and
so
did
i
it
was
life
in
a
fairy
tale
and
would
have
seemed
quite
perfect
if
but
i
had
grown
to
believe
that
nothing
was
ever
perfect
perhaps
it
were
wise
so
else
we
should
all
be
loath
even
more
to
leave
life
and
the
rift
in
the
lute
could
not
wholly
ruin
the
music
we
had
been
there
a
week
i
imagine
before
mercedes
howell
descended
upon
us
she
came
apparelled
marvellously
in
a
highly
chariot
and
brought
with
her
as
was
eminently
proper
her
parents
howell
née
dolores
maria
cortez
was
that
pathetic
thing
a
woman
who
had
once
been
very
beautiful
it
was
not
hard
to
trace
that
beauty
now
in
the
high
nose
the
great
languid
eyes
the
tiny
full
red
mouth
but
her
beauty
was
clouded
with
flesh
and
her
face
a
mask
of
powder
she
sat
on
the
verandah
drinking
pina
fria
with
her
tiny
arched
feet
on
a
footstool
and
murmured
polite
accented
thanks
for
the
care
we
had
taken
of
her
dear
child
i
glanced
at
bill
over
a
tray
of
cakes
but
he
was
looking
at
mercedes
so
i
turned
with
a
quickened
heartbeat
to
howell
i
found
him
charming
a
tall
silent
man
brown
from
the
sun
and
very
lined
he
listened
eagerly
i
fancied
to
my
chatter
of
home
and
snow
and
the
quiet
ebb
and
flow
of
life
in
a
new
england
village
but
cuba
had
marked
him
for
her
own
one
saw
that
and
one
saw
too
his
restless
eyes
moving
from
wife
to
daughter
questioning
and
troubled
howell
before
she
left
asked
us
to
some
day
attend
the
races
with
her
i
told
her
i
was
not
well
not
yet
up
to
the
excitement
of
crowds
but
bill
looking
up
quickly
from
his
conversation
with
mercedes
said
perhaps
i
can
persuade
denton
dear
lady
it
is
something
she
surely
should
not
miss
our
glances
met
crossed
blades
and
stayed
mine
was
hurt
i
know
it
was
cruel
of
him
in
that
insufferably
tone
to
brush
aside
my
wishes
when
our
guests
had
gone
i
told
him
so
but
he
said
at
the
doorway
what
you
need
more
than
anything
is
contact
with
people
and
to
be
taken
out
of
yourself
you
have
never
seen
anything
of
the
sort
before
and
you
will
not
have
the
opportunity
again
and
the
howells
are
very
good
people
to
tie
up
to
they
have
lived
here
many
years
and
have
not
wholly
discarded
the
picturesque
viewpoints
and
customs
of
the
country
while
at
the
same
time
entering
into
the
life
of
the
american
set
i
did
come
here
for
society
i
said
and
i
do
want
to
be
bothered
by
anyone
go
alone
to
the
races
if
you
will
but
i
shall
not
he
shrugged
very
well
he
said
two
days
later
bill
drove
the
car
into
havana
where
he
joined
the
howells
in
a
luncheon
party
and
went
afterwards
to
the
races
with
them
i
wondered
if
they
would
not
think
it
very
strange
under
the
circumstances
and
then
i
reflected
that
an
extra
man
married
or
bachelor
is
welcome
almost
anywhere
and
during
my
brief
betrothal
bill
had
declared
himself
quite
free
i
did
care
of
course
where
he
went
or
with
whom
it
was
none
of
my
business
and
it
was
the
loneliness
and
the
longing
for
things
that
could
never
be
mine
which
oppressed
me
and
made
me
spend
my
sleepless
afternoon
siesta
on
a
pillow
when
bill
came
home
that
night
i
harkened
politely
to
his
account
of
his
outing
and
then
went
early
to
my
room
the
poem
which
had
made
itself
mine
during
my
first
night
in
cuba
was
clamoring
to
be
written
and
so
i
wrote
it
at
my
table
under
the
window
conscious
that
no
words
in
so
unskilled
a
hand
could
set
down
my
feeling
of
imprisonment
and
regret
finished
i
laid
it
in
the
drawer
where
my
diary
and
the
letters
from
richard
warren
were
it
was
a
childish
thing
but
i
had
made
it
and
it
belonged
to
me
and
to
one
other
the
moonlight
slips
in
silence
through
the
bars
the
iron
bars
which
lend
a
strange
romance
to
my
wide
windows
open
to
the
stars
which
like
gold
imprisoned
dance
caught
in
the
dark
mantilla
of
the
night
that
flowing
veil
of
jewelled
enchanting
lace
from
careless
faery
flung
light
to
veil
the
tropic
moon
pale
ardent
face
my
windows
give
on
gardens
dim
and
freshly
fragrant
with
things
on
gardens
where
the
sleeping
flowers
dream
till
cradled
on
the
errant
wind
cool
wings
their
little
souls
are
wafted
to
far
lands
while
all
their
dreams
like
incense
float
and
rise
to
where
some
garden
goddess
with
white
hands
gems
with
bright
dew
her
nurslings
eyes
in
shadowed
groves
with
brilliant
moon
a
bird
is
sobbing
for
a
distant
star
in
golden
longing
for
the
unattained
while
at
some
window
pleading
a
guitar
touched
by
brown
fingers
throbs
in
serenade
and
still
the
moonbeams
fling
a
silvern
dart
straight
through
my
window
iron
barricade
thus
love
steals
silent
to
the
prisoned
heart
and
smiling
with
a
mockery
divine
slips
softly
to
some
unguessed
secret
shrine
to
set
the
altar
fires
flaming
high
i
closed
the
drawer
spent
unsatisfied
the
thing
was
halting
and
superficial
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
there
were
people
who
could
find
release
in
words
or
peace
in
beauty
i
had
not
reread
richard
warren
letters
since
my
marriage
and
this
was
a
night
i
dared
not
read
them
for
all
that
my
resolve
weakened
for
in
some
inexplicable
way
he
had
become
very
real
to
me
in
cuba
and
i
knew
that
he
could
not
be
anyone
save
himself
could
not
be
anything
save
strong
and
fine
and
understanding
i
took
my
trouble
into
peter
room
and
sat
with
it
for
a
long
time
by
his
bedside
but
it
was
dawn
before
in
my
cool
deep
alcove
i
had
ceased
tossing
and
slept
chapter
xi
a
week
slipped
by
before
we
returned
the
howells
call
then
one
brilliant
morning
i
drove
with
bill
into
havana
and
together
we
transacted
some
embarrassing
monetary
business
at
the
bank
after
which
i
expressed
a
desire
to
go
shopping
the
sidewalks
were
quite
impassable
so
narrow
that
for
the
most
part
the
pedestrians
unhurried
strolled
in
the
hardly
wider
streets
the
shops
held
me
fascinated
and
i
was
not
a
little
annoyed
at
the
manner
in
which
bill
conducted
my
purchases
here
a
gorgeous
feather
fan
there
a
piece
of
lace
and
in
another
spot
a
deadly
and
lovely
bit
of
toledo
workmanship
executed
with
rare
finesse
on
the
hilt
of
a
stiletto
yet
i
too
was
determined
not
to
return
to
green
hill
without
a
trunk
laden
with
gifts
for
my
dear
people
there
once
i
slipped
away
from
my
husband
who
was
deep
in
conversation
of
a
political
nature
judging
from
the
volubility
of
the
who
engaged
his
attention
and
entering
a
store
some
five
or
six
houses
away
i
tried
out
my
absurd
and
garbled
knowledge
of
spanish
with
terrifying
results
for
the
little
lady
who
guarded
the
delicate
linens
flooded
me
with
such
an
impressive
flow
of
wholly
unintelligible
syllables
that
baffled
i
beat
an
ignominious
retreat
followed
by
her
to
the
very
door
on
the
street
i
met
bill
hatless
and
disturbed
out
of
all
proportion
please
never
do
that
again
mavis
he
commanded
taking
my
arm
i
am
not
willing
to
have
you
roam
the
streets
of
havana
alone
i
drew
my
arm
away
i
am
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
myself
i
said
with
frigidity
especially
in
broad
daylight
this
is
not
green
hill
he
answered
enigmatically
nor
yet
new
york
i
started
to
reply
but
a
glance
from
a
passing
individual
immaculately
attired
in
white
quelled
me
i
had
never
before
encountered
anything
quite
so
sweeping
so
totally
inventorying
so
insolent
i
had
the
immediate
sensation
that
i
was
in
one
of
those
nightmare
dreams
in
which
one
walks
upon
a
public
highway
quite
unclothed
unconsciously
i
cast
a
reassuring
glance
at
my
lavender
linen
and
breathed
again
i
must
have
gasped
for
bill
looked
from
my
blazing
cheeks
to
the
wayfaring
gentleman
something
belligerent
came
into
his
eyes
and
then
he
looked
into
mine
lifting
his
brows
you
see
he
remarked
it
was
plain
that
i
had
seen
i
said
nothing
but
hastened
my
steps
where
did
you
leave
your
hat
i
asked
sweetly
we
retrieved
the
object
and
went
to
where
we
had
left
the
car
driving
to
a
restaurant
high
over
the
harbor
where
on
the
second
floor
we
lunched
deliciously
on
palatable
creatures
sinisterly
named
morro
crabs
and
other
delicacies
a
gun
boat
lay
far
off
at
rest
on
the
blue
waters
and
here
and
there
the
black
funnels
of
steamers
lifted
darkly
against
a
burning
sky
people
at
neighboring
tables
bowed
to
my
companion
several
came
over
to
us
and
were
presented
to
me
a
englishman
of
military
bearing
and
with
an
ineffable
air
of
detachment
from
his
surroundings
a
member
of
the
american
legation
a
lean
bearded
man
with
an
unamerican
name
and
a
dark
face
reminding
me
of
an
ancient
spanish
nobleman
whose
picture
i
had
once
seen
a
attractive
boy
and
others
whom
i
have
forgotten
and
the
meal
could
hardly
have
been
termed
a
i
was
heartily
glad
of
it
until
the
calling
hour
came
we
amused
ourselves
with
a
survey
of
the
crowded
districts
of
the
city
an
appalling
number
of
tourists
passed
and
repassed
us
obviously
bent
on
the
same
idle
occupation
pretty
girls
in
bright
sweaters
and
fat
mothers
similarly
clad
and
patient
bored
men
silent
or
loquacious
chewing
black
cuban
cigars
following
their
women
folk
in
and
out
the
shops
and
on
the
broader
thoroughfares
i
saw
the
cuban
women
driving
in
open
victorias
powdered
and
wonderfully
dressed
regarding
the
touristen
with
slightly
cynical
always
beautiful
eyes
the
howells
great
house
a
stone
structure
on
the
vadado
was
a
revelation
of
formal
and
chilling
luxury
as
we
waited
for
howell
to
come
to
us
in
the
bill
murmured
under
his
breath
dreamt
i
dwelt
in
marble
halls
is
it
amazing
before
i
could
answer
our
hostess
swept
in
accompanied
almost
preceded
by
an
overpowering
wave
of
perfume
i
had
no
time
to
reply
but
found
myself
nodding
at
him
in
sympathetic
appreciation
all
through
the
somewhat
stilted
conversation
which
followed
the
stately
tea
and
the
meteoric
appearance
of
mercedes
as
chatty
and
brilliant
as
some
tropical
bird
i
seemed
to
cling
to
the
solidity
and
confident
familiarity
of
my
husband
as
the
one
real
thing
in
an
unreal
room
but
leaving
i
was
forced
to
confess
to
myself
the
real
friendliness
and
cordiality
of
these
alien
people
towards
me
a
stranger
at
their
imposing
gates
it
was
mercedes
who
explained
to
me
that
the
feminine
quality
of
havana
did
not
go
in
sport
clothes
you
would
not
do
it
she
said
on
your
fifth
avenue
we
do
not
do
it
here
it
is
not
the
custom
we
wear
our
smartest
gowns
and
our
shoes
she
made
an
entrancing
little
moue
at
the
thought
of
sweaters
and
rubber
soles
and
with
a
feeling
of
commiseration
toward
my
comfortably
compatriots
dashing
through
havana
streets
lavish
of
exclamation
and
of
purse
i
was
foolishly
glad
that
something
had
prompted
me
to
look
my
coolest
and
prettiest
before
setting
forth
on
the
expedition
i
remember
that
day
well
for
it
was
on
the
same
evening
back
once
more
in
the
gardens
of
my
new
home
that
juan
the
native
workman
appeared
shortly
after
dinner
a
hat
clutched
to
his
sunken
chest
his
face
working
oddly
demanding
to
speak
to
the
doctor
i
heard
scattered
words
fiebre
and
agonia
and
the
name
annunciata
repeated
again
and
again
and
finally
when
bill
rose
with
a
quiet
brief
sentence
i
caught
a
and
dios
muchisimas
gracias
senor
from
the
old
man
juan
daughter
is
ill
bill
told
me
quickly
i
going
with
him
sha
be
long
go
to
bed
mavis
you
look
done
up
it
been
a
long
day
stopping
only
to
get
his
hat
and
an
emergency
case
he
was
gone
with
the
excited
anxious
old
man
and
i
was
alone
in
the
big
room
something
he
had
said
to
me
far
back
in
what
now
seemed
the
past
ages
came
to
me
vaguely
something
about
the
poetry
of
healing
and
i
pondered
upon
it
for
a
long
time
till
a
falling
log
roused
me
and
i
went
to
bed
but
not
until
i
heard
a
familiar
step
on
the
path
did
i
consider
sleeping
i
slipped
on
a
negligée
and
went
to
my
door
he
was
coming
toward
me
tired
i
thought
and
troubled
bill
i
called
softly
he
stopped
a
moment
peering
into
the
dim
light
which
streamed
through
the
door
into
the
narrow
long
hall
which
separated
our
rooms
mavis
and
then
reproachfully
why
are
you
in
bed
you
been
gone
hours
i
said
conscious
of
a
childish
petulance
how
is
she
with
a
hand
on
the
latch
of
his
own
door
he
considered
me
i
must
have
looked
a
sight
my
hair
in
braids
down
my
back
but
if
he
thought
so
he
did
not
say
it
all
right
now
he
answered
but
she
was
a
pretty
sick
girl
and
of
course
they
had
applied
remedies
liberally
sprinkled
with
superstition
it
looked
like
a
case
of
ptomaine
to
me
anyway
be
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
more
beatings
tomorrow
it
was
he
concluded
with
a
smile
a
rather
disconcerting
evening
half
a
dozen
people
praying
all
over
the
place
and
when
i
left
kissing
my
hands
lucky
i
had
some
experience
in
dealing
with
the
natives
before
this
i
glad
i
said
poor
old
juan
it
was
nice
of
you
to
wait
up
said
bill
suddenly
thanks
i
became
acutely
conscious
of
the
hour
and
of
my
appearance
i
i
was
interested
i
said
lamely
yes
that
it
he
answered
a
smile
lighting
up
his
worn
face
it
not
often
that
you
honor
me
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
reply
my
interest
is
solely
in
old
juan
and
his
daughter
but
i
did
it
did
seem
quite
fair
and
was
strictly
true
i
said
withdrawing
i
glad
she
all
right
from
his
closing
door
his
words
floated
back
to
me
noches
cara
mia
annunciata
recovered
and
to
sarah
outspoken
disapproval
i
had
her
come
often
to
the
house
she
sewed
excellently
and
embroidered
even
better
and
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
give
her
small
odds
and
ends
of
work
to
do
she
was
a
lovely
thing
rounded
and
supple
with
a
clear
skin
but
chancing
one
day
to
observe
her
mother
on
the
road
below
the
house
i
was
smitten
with
a
prophetic
horror
for
annunciata
future
for
the
woman
who
could
not
have
been
more
than
was
as
bent
and
gnarled
as
a
northerner
of
sixty
wrinkled
like
a
monkey
and
with
something
of
that
creature
patient
if
malicious
wisdom
in
her
eyes
i
began
to
realize
that
juan
too
was
according
to
our
standards
a
man
still
in
his
early
prime
i
was
confused
by
such
an
ordering
of
nature
i
said
something
of
this
to
bill
but
he
only
answered
knocking
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
southern
fruit
ripens
quickly
it
does
seem
fair
i
said
rebelliously
thinking
of
annunciata
and
her
slow
indolent
grace
at
sixteen
i
but
perhaps
i
was
not
a
good
example
our
girls
are
children
at
sixteen
i
told
him
you
are
a
child
at
what
is
it
he
answered
i
did
not
pursue
the
personal
application
further
but
it
was
not
right
that
this
young
thing
should
be
a
woman
so
soon
and
so
shortly
destined
to
be
old
youth
and
age
there
are
no
timid
blossomings
no
gracious
gradations
in
the
south
we
were
very
quietly
rather
gay
those
days
i
had
been
several
times
to
luncheon
at
the
country
club
and
had
met
a
number
of
delightful
americans
there
it
was
all
very
new
and
exciting
and
so
invariably
beautiful
and
i
was
absurdly
glad
that
bill
ranked
very
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
other
men
as
a
golfer
watching
remnants
of
the
game
from
the
long
wide
i
was
astounded
by
the
seriousness
with
which
grown
men
pursued
an
innocuous
white
ball
for
miles
and
miles
of
green
turf
once
in
the
late
afternoon
together
with
a
party
of
several
women
including
mercedes
howell
i
followed
a
match
game
for
a
time
the
exotic
view
the
stunted
palms
the
small
lizards
that
ran
almost
from
under
our
feet
animate
emeralds
the
glimpse
of
blue
water
from
a
hill
enthralled
me
but
i
think
that
the
small
black
or
tan
boys
who
carried
the
clubs
and
who
bet
their
prospective
fees
with
enthusiasm
on
the
respective
merits
of
their
employers
amused
me
more
than
anything
i
had
ever
seen
and
it
was
of
course
solely
from
sympathy
with
my
ebony
attendant
that
i
knew
a
certain
triumph
when
long
after
we
women
had
tired
and
returned
to
the
the
men
came
in
hot
and
shrieking
for
cool
drinks
proclaiming
bill
as
victor
he
had
saved
the
game
by
supernatural
putting
his
partner
the
fair
haired
boy
i
had
met
in
the
havana
restaurant
announced
enviously
you
should
be
proud
of
him
he
added
sitting
down
beside
me
i
am
i
said
dutifully
bill
en
route
to
a
mysterious
thing
called
a
locker
paused
to
cast
a
mirthful
look
at
me
and
quite
against
my
will
i
laughed
i
am
certain
that
the
blond
one
who
answered
to
the
name
of
bobby
willard
thought
me
demented
a
number
of
people
called
upon
us
almost
every
day
motoring
out
for
luncheon
or
tea
our
little
household
ran
smoothly
and
happily
sarah
and
nora
gradually
became
excellent
friends
and
evenings
i
would
often
hear
silas
low
voice
in
the
kitchen
and
going
in
to
consult
nora
would
surprise
his
lean
form
sprawled
in
a
kitchen
chair
two
legs
of
it
off
the
floor
smoking
his
inevitable
cigar
a
at
his
elbow
to
wing
and
fong
sarah
to
my
astonishment
perceptibly
unbent
it
was
apparent
that
the
two
silent
little
asiatics
regarded
her
with
admiration
and
awe
bill
suggested
that
she
was
doubtless
trying
to
convert
them
but
i
could
not
believe
that
peter
was
perhaps
the
most
happy
of
any
of
us
never
very
far
from
silas
side
he
assumed
a
lordly
dictatorship
over
the
natives
and
picked
up
an
amazing
amount
of
spanish
in
his
excursions
about
the
plantation
silas
taught
him
to
ride
too
on
a
lean
little
cuban
horse
and
would
ride
out
with
him
in
the
early
mornings
tremendously
amused
at
the
grave
manner
in
which
peter
would
return
the
salutations
of
the
passersby
in
those
days
also
i
elected
to
oversee
peter
neglected
education
and
with
more
ambition
than
efficiency
would
devote
the
half
hour
before
his
supper
time
to
teaching
him
to
read
bill
with
his
pipe
and
his
newspaper
would
attend
these
sessions
from
a
far
corner
of
the
room
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
reflecting
how
to
an
unenlightened
observer
very
domestic
we
would
appear
that
the
thought
had
not
escaped
bill
too
was
apparent
by
a
remark
he
made
one
evening
coming
to
the
he
looked
at
the
two
of
us
for
some
time
and
said
you
make
a
charming
picture
you
two
children
exemplary
he
added
with
a
smile
i
made
no
comment
but
bent
lower
over
the
page
on
which
the
pregnant
legend
this
is
a
cat
appeared
in
large
letters
flanking
an
appropriate
illustration
those
were
days
even
and
uneventful
in
the
larger
sense
there
were
varying
episodes
incidents
which
however
did
not
break
into
the
continuity
of
a
life
that
seemed
a
dream
once
i
went
fishing
with
bill
and
bobby
willard
it
was
pleasant
drifting
over
the
waters
and
of
our
not
inconsiderable
catch
nothing
remains
in
my
memory
save
the
almost
unnatural
beauty
of
certain
gorgeous
fish
colored
red
and
blue
and
purple
with
little
fins
i
had
my
first
swimming
lesson
in
many
years
at
that
time
too
and
the
picture
of
the
beach
the
feel
of
the
brilliantly
blue
water
the
laughing
people
and
the
many
children
stayed
with
me
for
a
long
time
at
my
second
dip
i
actually
swam
three
strokes
not
however
without
bill
solidly
protective
arm
he
swam
magnificently
himself
mercedes
howells
transformed
into
a
most
seductive
mermaid
by
a
bright
green
bathing
suit
was
most
outspoken
in
her
admiration
what
a
wonderful
figure
she
said
in
a
wholly
audible
aside
to
me
i
was
forced
to
agree
but
swallowed
a
good
deal
more
water
than
was
comfortable
in
the
process
bill
in
spite
of
his
vigorous
exploits
in
the
water
seemed
content
to
spend
most
of
his
swimming
hour
with
peter
and
me
but
after
he
had
sent
us
to
the
bathing
pavilion
to
dress
he
swam
far
out
to
join
mercedes
and
when
i
came
from
my
cubicle
again
they
were
just
coming
out
of
the
water
together
a
splendidly
matched
pair
laughing
vital
a
curious
languor
came
over
me
as
i
watched
them
walking
across
the
beach
you
tired
said
bill
dripping
before
me
a
little
i
admitted
so
after
that
i
swam
rarely
the
ride
in
from
guayabal
was
long
and
tiring
and
once
or
twice
a
week
i
stayed
at
home
while
bill
went
forth
in
the
motor
to
golf
and
swim
coming
back
in
time
for
dinner
i
was
never
bored
there
were
letters
from
father
to
answer
a
difficult
diplomatic
task
letters
too
from
the
goodriches
who
were
dashing
about
the
continent
at
a
speed
peter
had
half
an
album
filled
with
postcards
before
his
parents
had
been
on
the
other
side
two
weeks
and
of
course
i
had
to
take
innumerable
snapshots
with
the
little
kodak
bill
bought
me
in
havana
in
order
to
pictorially
report
peter
progress
uncle
john
wrote
often
sometimes
to
bill
sometimes
to
me
and
now
and
then
to
us
both
jointly
the
advent
of
the
mail
was
a
real
joy
no
one
seemed
to
forget
us
everyone
demanded
an
immediate
reply
and
it
was
difficult
not
to
put
off
letter
writing
until
the
morrow
for
i
had
not
been
in
cuba
more
than
hours
before
the
manana
philosophy
had
laid
hold
of
me
in
my
secret
drawer
a
little
pile
of
poems
grew
i
was
amazed
at
the
way
the
songs
came
to
me
sang
in
my
brain
and
would
not
be
still
until
i
had
put
them
on
paper
in
my
heart
i
harbor
a
timid
ambition
of
one
day
showing
them
to
uncle
john
if
he
would
publish
them
privately
i
could
send
a
copy
to
richard
warren
after
all
they
were
his
his
and
cuba
and
mine
own
between
tea
and
dinner
the
days
when
bill
was
not
at
home
i
would
walk
sometimes
with
little
peter
or
with
annunciata
sometimes
alone
save
for
little
wiggles
little
by
little
i
grew
to
know
the
natives
by
name
and
station
went
even
into
their
houses
dark
and
smoky
thatched
with
palm
leaves
and
odorous
with
charcoal
stoves
one
amusing
acquaintance
i
made
was
that
of
old
manuel
who
lived
not
for
from
our
gates
annunciata
took
me
there
affirming
that
of
all
the
guayablan
sights
this
was
one
i
must
not
miss
bill
was
horrified
to
hear
of
my
call
at
manuel
pitifully
poor
dwelling
but
he
went
there
himself
later
to
see
if
in
any
way
he
could
alleviate
the
very
obvious
poverty
and
probable
suffering
of
the
ancient
creature
for
the
tradition
had
it
that
manuel
was
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
old
certain
it
was
that
he
remembered
havana
when
it
was
little
more
than
a
age
had
shrunken
him
to
the
stature
of
a
child
but
his
eye
were
still
bright
his
features
cleancut
his
grey
hair
and
beard
still
curling
and
vigorous
the
village
people
took
a
certain
pride
in
their
ancient
and
he
did
not
lack
for
visitors
propped
up
on
a
bed
wrapped
in
rags
from
which
his
bare
thin
legs
protruded
he
received
me
with
great
dignity
and
we
talked
for
fully
half
an
hour
that
is
to
say
annunciata
talked
and
manuel
talked
and
now
and
then
the
former
would
translate
a
phrase
or
two
into
her
scanty
english
it
was
from
bill
however
that
i
heard
most
of
the
old
man
story
it
was
on
one
of
my
solitary
excursions
that
the
sudden
night
surprised
me
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
home
the
rim
of
mountains
grew
black
and
menacing
and
the
song
of
the
light
winds
in
the
palms
turned
to
a
sinister
whispering
with
wiggles
at
my
hurrying
heels
i
fairly
fled
through
the
night
ashamed
of
my
unreasoning
terror
a
group
of
rurales
the
native
soldiers
passed
me
with
a
clatter
of
hoofs
later
a
native
riding
saddleless
singing
in
a
curious
eerie
monotone
to
ward
off
the
evil
spirits
rode
slowly
by
there
was
a
heavy
perfume
in
the
air
and
a
young
moon
swung
delicately
into
view
but
i
had
no
heart
for
beauty
and
almost
stumbling
into
the
hedge
of
spanish
bayonets
which
fringed
our
property
i
came
through
the
open
gates
into
the
light
from
the
house
with
a
of
relief
and
an
exceedingly
youthful
fear
of
justifiable
chastisement
but
it
was
some
ten
minutes
after
i
had
come
home
that
i
heard
the
car
with
bill
at
the
wheel
swing
up
to
the
portico
that
evening
discussing
the
past
day
i
refrained
from
mentioning
my
little
adventure
for
it
was
an
adventure
mysterious
strange
and
somehow
terrifying
the
evenings
were
pleasant
we
read
a
great
deal
aloud
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
my
husband
no
mean
critic
widely
read
and
with
keen
appreciation
we
sat
always
before
the
fire
and
much
of
the
time
i
would
forget
to
listen
to
the
sense
of
the
words
hearing
only
the
sound
of
the
attractive
flexible
voice
and
watching
the
flames
on
the
big
hearth
i
never
wearied
of
that
there
was
a
wonderful
poem
in
the
logs
flowering
blue
and
rose
gold
and
scarlet
charring
to
white
and
red
which
seemed
like
some
extraordinary
singing
and
flickering
intensely
alive
in
disintegration
and
so
the
days
drew
into
march
and
still
we
lingered
bill
persuaded
by
neighbors
that
even
may
was
bearable
in
cuba
spoke
of
staying
at
least
until
the
middle
of
april
i
did
not
care
father
was
still
in
canada
and
green
hill
would
have
been
empty
without
him
it
was
a
life
and
i
was
content
the
sight
of
the
great
purple
orchids
fragile
and
almost
unbelievably
beautiful
clinging
to
the
was
enough
to
keep
me
happy
for
a
whole
day
to
look
from
the
windows
through
the
luxuriance
of
the
bourginvilla
vines
to
the
was
a
rare
delight
to
see
the
in
the
wind
the
hibiscus
under
a
noon
sun
the
peacocks
pacing
the
white
walks
before
sunset
was
to
live
a
poem
if
now
and
then
on
still
nights
a
restlessness
and
nostalgia
for
something
keener
sharper
something
unnamable
and
unknown
would
seize
me
it
would
vanish
again
before
the
breathless
expectant
dawn
and
if
one
grew
melancholy
there
was
always
arthur
to
turn
to
a
bird
philosophic
and
unexpected
who
had
developed
a
feud
with
wiggles
to
watch
the
two
of
them
arthur
resplendent
and
mocking
on
his
perch
wiggles
a
black
lump
of
outrage
dashing
up
and
down
before
the
door
of
the
wire
cage
which
was
as
big
as
a
small
room
was
a
sight
to
dispel
dull
care
and
from
someone
arthur
had
learned
endearing
names
pretty
darling
he
would
articulate
his
head
flirtatiously
to
one
side
his
beady
eyes
fixed
on
mine
his
claw
extended
with
quite
the
grand
manner
and
when
nettled
by
his
tone
i
would
advance
to
the
cage
he
would
slide
off
to
the
other
end
of
his
perch
and
demand
bleakly
coffee
gol
dern
bow
wow
wow
a
climax
that
never
failed
to
arouse
wiggles
to
frenzy
and
so
between
beauty
and
laughter
firelight
and
sunshine
we
trod
all
unknowing
perilously
close
to
tragedy
chapter
xii
cactus
twisted
deformed
and
stretching
thorny
hands
to
mock
the
golden
beauty
of
the
south
embodied
evil
set
in
glowing
lands
like
some
black
curse
within
a
lovely
mouth
the
sullen
cactus
lone
and
brooding
stands
yet
earth
deems
her
crippled
offspring
worthy
still
to
bear
the
crown
of
perfect
blossoms
as
beseems
some
dark
misshapen
souls
in
secret
wear
the
splendid
flower
of
their
silent
dreams
it
was
of
course
the
tall
cactus
to
the
left
of
the
house
which
set
me
to
singing
for
a
long
time
it
had
affronted
me
pallid
sickly
abnormal
flowering
suddenly
into
crimson
blossom
it
was
for
me
an
actual
blot
on
the
lovely
landscape
gardening
of
the
palms
but
one
day
i
said
something
of
this
to
bill
and
he
said
it
may
start
out
in
ugliness
but
it
rooted
in
strength
and
ends
in
beauty
does
it
this
gave
me
furiously
to
think
in
an
early
letter
to
me
richard
warren
had
said
something
very
much
the
same
not
however
apropos
of
cactus
plants
and
here
was
my
mocking
husband
preaching
the
same
doctrine
of
beauty
everywhere
after
that
i
tried
to
make
friends
with
the
uncouth
cactus
and
as
so
often
happens
grew
quite
attached
to
it
nights
it
stood
like
a
sentinel
ghost
its
deformities
softened
and
its
flowers
courageous
and
gay
in
the
moonlight
my
growing
sense
of
comradeship
with
bill
was
materially
increased
at
that
remark
of
his
we
were
really
quite
friendly
by
that
time
playing
together
like
two
children
not
much
older
than
peterkins
and
the
rather
ironic
attitude
toward
me
which
i
had
so
resented
seemed
to
lessen
or
at
least
to
be
less
noticeable
if
it
had
been
for
peter
or
if
it
had
been
for
me
and
if
bill
had
said
anyway
our
even
sunny
life
and
relationship
came
to
an
abrupt
end
on
a
day
when
bill
elected
to
golf
with
howells
mercedes
had
developed
wonderfully
as
a
gallery
of
one
i
chose
to
stay
at
home
and
attend
to
a
number
of
small
neglected
duties
the
day
before
we
had
spent
near
mariano
with
one
of
the
secretaries
at
the
american
legation
and
his
wife
we
had
had
a
delightful
day
in
a
most
fascinating
house
all
cool
wide
patios
and
flat
roofs
over
which
the
palms
waved
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
were
not
in
cuba
or
even
spain
but
somewhere
in
the
far
east
at
the
wife
of
the
chinese
minister
called
a
tiny
lady
exquisite
and
looking
far
too
young
to
be
the
mother
of
seven
sturdy
children
as
she
proudly
assured
me
she
was
to
hear
her
talk
of
my
boy
in
yale
seemed
positively
absurd
it
was
as
i
have
said
a
delightful
day
but
tiring
and
i
was
content
to
stay
at
home
when
the
next
day
dawned
very
hot
and
still
peter
rode
in
the
morning
and
chased
hatless
about
the
grounds
in
the
afternoon
he
had
made
many
friends
among
the
i
saw
him
at
luncheon
and
then
not
until
after
tea
something
perhaps
the
very
oppressive
atmosphere
made
me
restless
and
out
of
sorts
i
started
about
four
to
walk
aimlessly
toward
the
gates
and
encountering
peter
and
wiggles
invited
them
to
accompany
me
afterwards
it
occurred
to
me
that
peter
seemed
very
quiet
he
walked
along
beside
me
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
with
none
of
his
usual
flow
of
general
misinformation
but
i
was
preoccupied
more
so
than
i
had
been
in
weeks
father
had
been
in
my
thoughts
all
day
and
back
in
my
brain
there
were
other
thoughts
vague
and
unformed
but
curiously
disturbing
i
was
beset
with
a
desire
a
longing
for
something
i
knew
not
what
it
was
perhaps
a
species
of
of
wanderlust
which
seized
upon
me
and
set
me
to
walking
now
now
languidly
we
had
gone
perhaps
a
half
a
mile
when
a
strange
little
sound
escaped
from
peter
lips
for
the
first
time
i
looked
at
his
little
mouth
a
white
line
stood
out
against
the
dark
red
color
it
the
heat
i
said
to
myself
and
asked
him
anxiously
do
you
feel
very
warm
peterkins
his
answer
was
almost
inaudible
and
he
drooped
wearily
against
my
side
as
we
stood
there
in
the
white
road
with
the
distant
fringe
of
mountains
almost
dancing
under
quivering
waves
of
heat
wiggles
panting
looked
at
us
anxiously
his
scrap
of
a
tongue
between
his
crooked
teeth
we
go
right
home
said
i
feigning
an
unconcern
i
did
not
feel
i
took
his
hand
and
was
terrified
at
the
burning
touch
of
it
realizing
that
the
child
was
ill
perhaps
seriously
so
and
that
we
were
half
a
mile
from
home
something
like
despair
came
over
me
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
i
could
carry
peter
he
was
a
tall
boy
for
his
age
and
very
heavy
it
only
remained
to
put
my
arm
about
him
and
to
coax
him
along
a
slow
and
painful
task
we
had
covered
the
first
half
of
the
distance
when
i
heard
a
car
behind
us
and
turned
hopefully
to
hail
it
and
when
the
long
green
body
shot
clearly
into
sight
i
was
suddenly
faint
with
relief
bill
coming
back
early
from
the
club
bill
at
the
wheel
his
hat
off
and
the
wind
blowing
his
dark
hair
the
car
stopped
mavis
it
too
hot
for
you
and
peter
to
be
out
i
play
what
the
matter
i
lifted
peter
in
my
arms
it
peter
bill
i
said
he
in
two
minutes
i
was
in
the
back
seat
with
the
boy
in
my
arms
and
bill
was
urging
the
car
to
her
utmost
speed
and
we
were
suddenly
home
between
them
bill
and
sarah
got
peter
into
bed
i
was
too
frightened
to
be
of
any
use
i
kept
thinking
of
the
little
reynolds
boy
who
had
died
of
fever
in
that
very
house
and
of
peter
mother
but
i
did
dare
think
of
her
long
because
i
could
see
her
eyes
so
plainly
as
they
looked
when
she
said
you
take
good
care
of
peter
for
me
wo
you
mavis
good
care
of
peter
for
a
week
i
had
hardly
thought
of
him
i
kissed
him
mornings
and
nights
gave
him
his
lessons
listened
to
his
chatter
not
really
heeding
and
i
had
been
away
so
much
drunken
with
my
new
freedom
my
strength
blooming
like
a
plant
in
the
climate
that
tried
so
many
other
people
sorely
utterly
wrapped
up
in
my
own
sensations
and
impressions
i
went
softly
into
the
room
peter
shared
with
sarah
it
was
a
different
boy
tossing
on
the
bed
with
that
curious
flush
the
groping
hands
talking
incessantly
incoherently
bill
bending
over
him
looked
up
as
i
came
in
his
face
was
strange
to
me
too
no
not
quite
i
had
seen
that
intense
almost
grim
look
on
that
face
once
before
as
i
came
out
of
a
dark
hour
of
agony
and
looked
for
the
first
time
into
two
eyes
oh
what
is
it
i
asked
very
low
is
he
dangerously
ill
a
touch
of
sun
he
answered
yes
he
pretty
sick
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
all
that
night
i
went
in
and
out
of
the
room
glad
if
they
would
let
me
bring
them
little
things
water
a
glass
a
spoon
it
made
matters
worse
to
find
nora
praying
loudly
in
the
kitchen
and
silas
his
lean
face
all
broken
up
into
soft
lines
of
anxiety
and
sorrow
watching
up
with
her
the
news
spread
in
some
indeterminable
fashion
during
the
night
a
number
of
the
men
on
the
plantation
came
to
the
door
to
ask
for
news
peter
had
endeared
himself
to
half
guayabal
about
three
in
the
morning
worn
out
i
went
into
the
bathroom
for
something
for
bill
as
i
did
not
reappear
with
it
he
came
to
look
for
me
presently
and
found
me
huddled
against
the
wall
my
hands
at
my
throat
an
abject
picture
of
cowardice
and
fright
i
was
not
alone
in
the
room
a
few
yards
away
from
me
on
the
tiled
floor
a
spider
was
sprawling
regarding
me
with
almost
human
terribly
malicious
eyes
the
creature
was
as
large
as
a
black
horribly
spotted
with
red
it
many
legs
twitching
with
vicious
life
are
you
ill
bill
asked
as
i
pointed
with
a
shaking
hand
to
the
spider
which
at
the
sound
of
another
step
had
taken
itself
quickly
to
another
corner
of
the
room
my
husband
put
his
arm
about
me
and
conducted
me
safely
to
my
own
room
you
poor
child
was
all
he
said
and
closed
the
door
into
the
bathroom
a
few
minutes
later
i
heard
him
occupied
in
there
with
what
seemed
or
sounded
like
a
there
was
a
scuffle
once
i
heard
bill
curse
and
then
finally
silence
presently
my
door
opened
and
bill
came
in
i
disposed
of
your
visitor
he
said
quite
cheerfully
nasty
mess
and
peter
is
better
he
be
all
right
i
sure
only
we
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
of
him
after
this
and
now
i
want
you
to
go
to
bed
or
i
shall
have
another
patient
on
my
hands
i
went
to
bed
but
not
until
the
rain
came
about
five
and
room
became
quiet
did
i
fall
into
a
troubled
sleep
it
was
past
noon
before
i
woke
sarah
looking
very
tired
came
in
with
some
coffee
and
the
assurance
that
peter
was
out
of
all
danger
and
was
sleeping
quietly
with
the
fever
broken
oh
sarah
i
said
you
have
had
any
sleep
denton
sent
me
to
bed
at
five
she
answered
but
he
never
took
his
own
clothes
off
until
about
eight
i
slept
in
the
guest
room
the
other
side
of
peter
and
when
i
woke
about
seven
again
i
got
some
coffee
for
him
from
norah
and
he
left
me
with
peter
then
and
went
into
his
own
room
is
he
asleep
now
i
asked
getting
out
of
bed
no
for
i
heard
the
water
running
in
his
bath
half
an
hour
ago
while
i
was
dressing
i
heard
bill
in
peter
room
heard
too
with
what
gratitude
peter
own
normal
voice
weak
but
sane
again
i
slipped
on
a
frock
hastily
and
went
in
to
them
of
the
two
i
thought
that
bill
looked
the
worst
very
white
and
drawn
after
luncheon
when
wing
had
disappeared
in
the
pantry
bill
told
me
that
peter
had
had
a
very
close
call
i
do
like
to
blame
anyone
of
course
he
said
with
knitted
brows
but
if
sarah
did
have
sense
enough
well
silas
has
lived
in
cuba
long
enough
to
have
known
that
the
heat
yesterday
was
sufficient
to
knock
out
a
strong
man
much
less
a
little
boy
if
he
became
i
afraid
it
was
my
fault
i
answered
slowly
peter
was
riding
all
morning
and
romping
all
afternoon
and
then
i
took
him
for
a
walk
did
you
know
then
that
he
had
been
playing
hard
all
day
bill
asked
me
why
yes
i
said
honestly
but
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
and
bill
hand
went
out
in
an
impatient
gesture
did
feel
the
heat
he
asked
i
suppose
so
i
answered
but
i
had
been
in
the
house
all
day
and
peter
had
he
finished
for
me
somewhat
irrelevantly
i
thought
i
was
silent
it
incredible
said
my
husband
with
extreme
irritation
that
you
should
have
noticed
but
i
began
and
stopped
it
was
true
i
had
noticed
and
it
was
equally
true
that
the
fact
was
incredible
conscious
of
my
guilt
i
was
still
able
to
be
resentful
of
my
husband
tone
do
you
think
for
a
minute
i
began
indignantly
with
no
clear
idea
of
how
i
was
going
to
finish
so
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
that
i
was
interrupted
i
do
think
anything
at
all
he
said
but
i
that
i
should
have
gone
away
had
i
known
the
day
was
going
to
turn
out
such
a
scorcher
i
would
have
stayed
his
tone
implied
that
what
he
should
have
known
was
that
i
was
not
fit
to
be
trusted
alone
i
did
like
the
implication
and
i
said
so
after
which
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
i
had
positively
flounced
from
the
room
after
the
manner
of
our
grandmothers
and
left
him
sitting
there
i
did
see
him
again
until
dinner
it
was
not
a
particularly
joyful
meal
during
the
rather
silent
progress
of
dinner
i
had
the
grace
to
be
rather
ashamed
of
some
of
the
things
i
had
said
in
the
cooler
light
of
reason
i
looked
on
a
number
of
the
statements
i
had
made
and
found
them
unconvincing
our
sporadic
conversation
was
of
trivial
things
not
until
wing
had
departed
kitchenward
and
bill
lighted
his
cigarette
was
our
late
unpleasantness
alluded
to
mavis
said
my
husband
with
a
hint
of
the
old
ironic
smile
i
had
not
seen
in
many
weeks
and
which
immediately
alienated
me
from
him
i
afraid
that
we
were
both
a
little
tired
and
this
morning
and
for
anything
i
said
which
may
have
offended
you
i
am
quite
ready
to
ask
your
pardon
however
it
is
perhaps
just
as
well
that
i
understand
the
way
you
feel
about
me
i
am
admittedly
then
a
and
i
have
to
criticize
you
unfairly
and
without
cause
or
so
you
have
said
let
that
pass
the
most
important
thing
is
that
you
are
becoming
bored
with
this
solitary
confinement
and
it
so
happens
that
it
is
within
my
power
to
offer
you
more
congenial
companionship
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
wright
penny
you
recall
him
do
you
not
he
is
in
santiago
and
proposes
to
come
to
havana
and
run
out
to
see
us
if
it
is
agreeable
to
you
i
shall
wire
him
to
come
on
prepared
to
stay
and
to
return
north
with
us
when
we
go
would
you
like
that
seven
times
seven
little
devils
entered
into
me
then
and
i
clasped
my
hands
on
the
table
and
made
my
eyes
round
with
pleasure
i
would
be
delighted
i
said
sincerely
enough
i
liked
penny
what
little
i
saw
of
him
and
i
am
sure
that
he
would
be
a
congenial
our
first
remarked
bill
with
a
wholly
wicked
grin
and
i
felt
as
if
we
had
slipped
back
several
months
to
a
time
when
enmity
was
the
only
possible
thing
between
us
and
our
weeks
of
pleasant
comradeship
were
the
shadow
of
a
dream
there
must
be
i
thought
a
very
real
antagonism
for
one
another
in
our
natures
for
otherwise
so
deep
and
unspoken
a
breach
could
not
have
been
made
in
ten
minutes
of
foolish
anger
wright
says
bill
continued
that
he
hesitates
to
intrude
upon
our
honeymoon
hours
a
pretty
alliteration
it
is
not
necessary
i
hope
to
inform
him
of
his
mistake
he
may
have
eyes
i
suggested
being
a
poet
he
objected
he
is
probably
myopic
i
ignored
this
i
must
find
him
some
pretty
girls
to
play
with
i
said
idly
mercedes
said
bill
might
fit
the
case
i
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
flare
of
anger
bobby
willard
little
sister
i
said
seems
more
penny
type
she
is
very
gentle
and
lovely
meow
said
my
husband
with
a
rising
inflection
the
bright
color
came
to
my
cheeks
not
at
all
i
said
indignantly
i
like
mercedes
howell
very
much
but
bill
raised
an
eyebrow
smiled
at
the
glowing
end
of
the
cigarette
in
his
hand
and
said
nothing
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
toward
the
door
have
miss
willard
out
here
by
all
means
he
said
but
she
milk
and
water
for
my
own
amusement
in
my
own
humble
opinion
mercedes
is
more
stimulating
to
the
tired
business
man
he
stopped
to
light
another
cigarette
of
course
he
said
through
the
first
breath
of
smoke
wright
will
naturally
suspect
you
of
all
young
happily
married
women
have
that
benign
tendency
i
was
stricken
dumb
with
sudden
hatred
and
before
my
lips
could
open
again
bill
with
wiggles
at
his
heels
went
out
into
the
sunshine
whistling
the
challenging
song
from
the
first
act
of
carmen
i
went
to
my
room
and
wrote
a
letter
which
however
i
was
destined
never
to
send
to
richard
warren
peter
convalescence
kept
me
occupied
for
several
days
he
had
a
number
of
sympathetic
callers
from
annunciata
to
the
howells
i
told
mercedes
that
i
would
expect
her
out
often
to
amuse
our
impending
poet
and
she
preened
her
bright
plumage
a
little
and
vowed
that
a
new
man
would
be
a
looking
at
bill
the
while
at
which
with
that
still
ringing
in
my
ears
i
asked
her
and
her
parents
to
join
us
at
dinner
the
night
following
expected
arrival
on
the
morning
of
that
arrival
bill
tossed
over
to
me
a
letter
from
uncle
john
denton
there
are
messages
in
it
for
you
he
said
and
opened
his
new
york
i
read
the
letter
and
as
i
returned
it
to
the
envelope
saw
a
second
sheet
which
i
had
not
noticed
uncle
john
often
sent
me
little
enclosures
in
bill
letters
innocently
i
drew
it
out
unfolded
it
and
started
to
read
damn
said
my
husband
without
apology
reaching
my
side
in
two
long
steps
i
thought
i
had
taken
that
out
give
it
to
me
mavis
but
i
had
already
read
enough
have
you
unmasked
warren
for
mavis
yet
wrote
uncle
john
and
how
does
she
like
being
the
wife
of
her
favorite
poet
when
are
we
to
have
the
manuscript
of
the
new
volume
you
long
overdue
now
you
miserable
creature
give
it
to
me
said
bill
i
handed
the
note
to
him
without
a
word
i
could
have
spoken
had
my
life
depended
on
it
he
followed
me
to
the
door
of
my
room
mavis
he
said
once
or
twice
i
put
my
hand
on
the
latch
do
speak
to
me
i
said
in
my
room
i
sat
down
by
the
window
and
tried
to
think
what
it
all
meant
for
a
time
i
was
incapable
of
directed
thought
my
dream
came
to
me
the
dream
i
had
had
so
long
ago
that
nightmare
in
which
my
unknown
poet
had
changed
to
the
semblance
of
the
man
i
had
met
and
disliked
on
meeting
william
denton
so
it
was
true
then
after
a
little
i
thought
of
my
letters
my
silly
fragile
written
for
the
one
mercilessly
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
the
other
in
my
desk
drawer
lay
yet
another
letter
unmailed
thank
god
a
letter
in
which
i
had
said
i
wanted
him
back
wanted
the
comfort
and
the
understanding
his
letters
had
brought
me
once
again
fool
fool
and
blind
and
all
the
time
this
talented
trickster
had
known
and
laughed
had
written
me
the
friendly
lovely
letters
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
had
even
spoken
to
me
of
love
i
went
over
to
the
drawer
and
took
out
my
diary
all
lies
some
day
i
must
burn
it
but
not
yet
it
was
like
a
living
thing
to
me
the
little
blue
book
fell
open
and
certain
words
leaped
out
at
me
diary
i
have
found
him
i
the
heart
and
brain
and
beautiful
spirit
of
him
and
all
day
long
his
name
makes
a
happy
spot
in
my
consciousness
richard
warren
richard
warren
i
closed
the
book
and
laid
it
back
with
the
letters
a
great
sheaf
of
thin
typewritten
pages
all
lies
uncle
john
had
been
in
the
plot
then
and
wright
penny
it
was
very
clear
to
me
now
i
took
from
my
neck
the
jade
which
richard
warren
had
sent
me
and
flung
it
out
of
the
window
wiggles
prowling
beneath
barked
happily
and
set
out
to
retrieve
it
even
wiggles
was
not
mine
nothing
i
had
had
was
mine
i
laid
my
head
on
the
desk
and
cried
bitterly
it
hard
to
see
the
dreams
go
to
watch
the
castle
you
have
builded
on
the
shifting
sands
crumble
and
fall
these
things
had
meant
so
much
to
me
ill
and
prisoned
and
had
continued
to
make
a
little
inner
life
for
me
after
the
physical
prison
doors
had
opened
if
only
by
a
miracle
i
could
have
been
back
in
green
hill
in
my
room
never
to
walk
again
and
with
richard
warren
letters
coming
to
me
out
of
the
unknown
then
i
remembered
there
was
no
richard
warren
chapter
xiii
after
a
long
time
i
heard
a
knock
at
my
door
may
i
speak
with
you
mavis
just
for
a
moment
said
my
husband
i
steadied
my
voice
with
an
effort
i
ca
imagine
that
you
have
anything
of
interest
to
tell
me
i
answered
is
it
time
you
went
to
havana
to
meet
mr
penny
there
was
an
exclamation
and
suddenly
the
door
was
flung
open
and
bill
came
in
look
here
he
said
we
got
to
have
this
thing
out
once
and
for
all
i
was
standing
my
wet
handkerchief
in
a
tight
hard
wad
in
my
hand
please
leave
my
room
i
said
coldly
not
till
i
said
what
i
want
to
i
sorry
you
found
out
about
the
book
i
was
going
to
tell
you
later
but
now
that
you
have
we
ignore
it
it
was
the
merest
coincidence
that
i
met
you
before
your
first
letter
came
and
i
was
deep
in
it
before
i
realized
that
you
were
bound
to
dislike
me
as
i
really
am
and
then
i
could
tell
you
things
you
said
in
your
letters
made
it
absolutely
impossible
for
me
and
for
reasons
of
my
own
i
had
preserved
my
incognito
very
carefully
only
uncle
john
knew
and
wright
and
my
mother
and
your
father
father
and
his
mother
the
little
lady
who
had
written
to
me
to
whom
i
had
confided
my
admiration
for
her
son
minute
by
minute
shame
was
flooding
me
shame
and
a
terribly
tired
feeling
does
your
mother
know
i
asked
that
we
are
married
no
he
answered
i
had
reasons
for
not
telling
her
just
yet
she
knows
i
am
in
cuba
of
course
you
have
never
asked
me
about
my
people
so
i
hardly
thought
it
worth
while
to
mention
her
to
you
under
the
circumstances
i
sorry
it
has
turned
out
as
it
has
he
said
after
a
pause
you
do
understand
i
could
agree
with
him
there
i
afraid
not
i
said
he
lifted
his
shoulders
ever
so
slightly
a
gesture
of
defeat
please
he
said
but
something
in
my
eyes
stopped
him
his
face
grew
very
hard
i
think
he
said
that
you
are
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
a
range
of
mountains
because
i
wrote
a
few
verses
that
struck
your
fancy
because
you
did
not
like
the
actual
author
because
i
preferred
to
hide
behind
my
and
because
you
choose
to
honor
richard
warren
with
your
friendly
regard
he
shrugged
again
and
because
perhaps
foolishly
i
want
to
be
liked
for
what
i
am
and
not
for
what
i
set
down
on
paper
i
preferred
to
play
what
i
fancied
was
a
very
charming
little
game
and
now
you
accuse
me
of
having
cheated
i
have
nothing
of
the
sort
i
answered
but
did
it
not
occur
to
you
during
your
game
that
you
were
playing
with
an
opponent
wholly
innocent
of
the
fact
that
she
was
playing
blindfolded
and
that
the
cards
were
stacked
we
both
heard
the
car
drive
up
to
the
front
door
well
he
said
my
cards
are
on
the
table
now
mavis
the
car
is
waiting
i
said
you
had
best
go
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
game
is
over
richard
warren
as
i
knew
him
never
existed
only
a
very
clever
young
doctor
who
amused
himself
at
my
expense
here
i
said
turning
to
the
open
drawer
are
your
letters
take
them
please
they
would
make
good
reading
of
the
type
which
is
called
fiction
careful
said
bill
under
his
breath
and
his
hand
shot
out
and
caught
my
arm
careful
mavis
you
are
going
just
a
little
too
far
i
twisted
my
arm
away
and
you
i
asked
furiously
and
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
and
the
clear
flame
of
anger
leaped
into
the
eyes
the
door
closed
behind
him
i
stood
for
a
moment
quite
still
rubbing
the
bruised
place
on
my
arm
which
his
fingers
had
made
richard
warren
letters
lay
on
the
floor
i
caught
them
up
hurried
to
the
living
room
there
was
a
burning
log
on
the
hearth
and
under
bill
hostile
eyes
as
he
gathered
up
his
hat
and
gloves
i
put
the
sheets
in
the
fire
they
writhed
shot
high
in
flame
and
blackening
fell
to
ashes
something
in
me
cried
out
at
that
they
had
been
so
dear
so
dear
have
you
my
letters
i
asked
him
rising
and
dusting
off
my
hands
no
he
replied
i
never
keep
letters
it
was
the
one
redeeming
fact
that
had
come
to
my
knowledge
that
day
i
mentioned
this
and
went
past
him
into
my
own
room
again
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
an
hour
space
i
had
lived
many
years
and
grown
very
old
when
i
heard
the
car
drive
off
i
went
out
on
the
verandah
with
peter
and
played
with
him
for
a
time
before
i
dressed
i
wanted
to
look
my
prettiest
for
penny
and
i
blessed
a
kindly
providence
that
he
was
to
interrupt
my
wholly
impossible
and
one
determination
i
made
as
soon
as
i
returned
to
green
hill
i
would
take
steps
to
be
free
again
father
would
soon
get
used
to
the
idea
it
would
hurt
him
of
course
but
someone
is
always
being
hurt
travel
perhaps
father
would
take
me
to
the
continent
but
never
again
to
the
tropics
i
had
had
enough
of
their
soft
friendly
ways
and
their
treachery
when
it
was
necessary
that
uncle
john
denton
be
told
of
the
predestined
fiasco
of
my
marriage
i
for
one
would
not
shirk
it
bill
was
his
nephew
but
i
was
the
daughter
of
his
dearest
friend
and
he
had
cared
for
me
since
i
was
a
baby
sometimes
quite
recently
i
had
fancied
that
he
had
cared
too
for
my
mother
but
at
all
events
he
would
not
be
angry
with
me
when
he
knew
of
that
much
i
was
certain
it
was
a
very
cordial
and
sparkling
hostess
who
met
her
guest
and
her
husband
at
the
door
i
had
put
on
the
little
white
voile
which
of
all
my
daytime
frocks
i
thought
the
most
becoming
i
had
dressed
my
hair
high
and
thrust
a
wonderful
orchid
through
my
mauve
belt
my
cheeks
were
burning
and
i
had
a
moment
of
as
i
heard
the
wheels
of
the
car
on
the
drive
it
would
not
be
easy
to
carry
it
off
to
hide
my
hurt
and
my
shame
but
pride
helps
wonderfully
always
in
any
situation
and
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
the
girl
who
looked
back
at
me
from
the
long
mirror
in
the
as
i
passed
it
on
my
way
to
the
verandah
but
although
all
the
stains
of
crying
had
gone
from
my
eyes
and
left
them
bright
they
were
different
eyes
than
the
ones
which
had
read
the
first
lines
of
uncle
john
letter
brown
eyes
and
big
but
with
all
the
dreams
washed
from
them
perhaps
it
was
better
so
a
very
hearty
welcome
penny
i
said
smiling
as
our
slight
blonde
guest
untangled
himself
from
his
bags
and
jumped
to
the
step
it
good
to
see
you
again
for
heaven
sake
denton
he
expostulated
not
heeding
my
greeting
but
taking
both
my
hands
in
his
do
ruin
my
first
impression
of
this
ripping
place
and
of
this
miraculous
you
by
pinning
that
awful
label
on
me
do
you
think
he
begged
that
you
could
manage
in
fair
exchange
for
i
answered
smiling
you
on
he
said
dropping
my
hands
after
a
vigorous
clasp
that
is
to
say
if
bill
has
no
objection
bill
turned
from
a
colloquy
with
wing
and
silas
and
waved
benevolently
in
our
direction
not
an
objection
he
answered
gaily
mavis
has
me
trained
her
word
is
naturally
my
law
if
that
was
the
tone
he
wished
to
adopt
i
was
convinced
that
here
at
least
was
a
game
which
two
could
play
bill
is
a
very
satisfactory
husband
i
confided
to
wright
pleasantly
he
and
i
have
discovered
the
best
basis
possible
for
matrimony
what
that
asked
wright
as
we
went
into
the
lord
you
lucky
people
what
a
wonderful
house
is
it
i
said
and
then
answering
the
question
a
mutual
platform
of
liberty
independence
and
love
said
wright
triumphantly
how
did
you
guess
it
asked
bill
following
his
guest
i
laughed
a
little
hysterically
and
bade
bill
show
wright
to
his
room
after
which
with
a
sense
of
having
scored
i
waited
for
the
men
near
the
luncheon
having
been
announced
we
late
today
i
said
as
we
all
sat
down
i
postponed
the
sacred
meal
a
little
to
allow
you
to
arrive
it
only
objected
wright
looking
at
his
watch
i
know
but
one
does
things
differently
in
guayabal
i
said
explaining
our
usual
routine
some
life
said
the
newly
initiated
suits
me
let
stay
on
here
forever
i
imagine
he
went
on
turning
to
include
us
both
in
his
remark
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
perfect
for
the
de
bill
was
silent
but
i
agreed
hastily
and
now
tell
us
about
santiago
i
said
the
recital
occupied
most
of
the
conversational
part
of
the
meal
pleasantly
enough
see
my
pretty
senoritas
asked
bill
passing
the
cigarettes
cuban
inquired
wright
taking
one
that
good
i
developed
a
passion
for
them
no
not
a
senorita
all
i
saw
were
at
least
ninety
and
weighed
a
ton
i
got
just
the
girl
for
you
said
bill
and
i
simultaneously
wright
laughed
the
same
one
he
asked
with
interest
no
our
tastes
differ
i
answered
the
one
i
have
in
mind
is
little
and
round
and
she
delightful
and
mine
said
bill
is
just
the
right
height
just
the
right
shape
and
as
and
as
a
spanish
princess
she
is
half
spanish
too
which
means
temperament
very
interesting
said
wright
bring
both
on
but
i
like
hair
and
brown
eyes
myself
did
you
corner
the
market
on
the
combination
bill
of
course
answered
bill
gravely
there
are
two
like
mavis
that
mould
was
broken
lucky
for
me
agreed
wright
sighing
i
want
to
stay
a
carefree
bachelor
i
susceptible
enough
lord
knows
and
very
guileless
but
my
appearance
protects
me
as
well
as
a
certain
modesty
not
to
say
timidity
of
manner
i
not
your
looks
nor
your
way
with
the
wimmin
you
handsome
bridegroom
he
concluded
affectionately
smiling
at
bill
do
tell
me
i
asked
leaning
back
in
my
great
carved
chair
quite
conscious
that
it
served
as
an
effective
background
for
my
hair
about
bill
past
i
ca
get
a
word
out
of
him
on
the
subject
there
was
a
spark
of
admiration
in
the
glance
bill
shot
me
an
involuntary
tribute
wait
till
we
alone
whispered
wright
mysteriously
i
could
a
tale
unfold
enough
to
turn
your
hair
grey
broken
hearts
all
over
the
place
he
just
stepped
on
anonymous
letters
begging
for
a
lock
of
hair
or
an
old
glove
there
have
been
times
when
your
husband
madame
has
been
forced
to
assume
a
disguise
you
colossal
idiot
said
bill
amiably
do
listen
to
him
mavis
urged
bill
best
friend
listen
to
me
instead
i
willing
to
be
convinced
i
answered
and
now
that
you
both
on
your
second
cigarette
shall
we
walk
about
the
place
a
little
bill
i
went
on
turning
to
him
very
sweetly
would
you
mind
running
to
my
room
and
getting
my
big
lavender
shade
hat
right
on
the
bureau
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
he
would
shake
me
i
knew
he
wanted
to
but
instead
he
swung
obediently
away
and
took
his
revenge
in
a
careless
all
right
dear
as
he
went
off
is
he
a
peach
mused
wright
aloud
watching
admiringly
the
figure
across
the
room
you
known
him
long
i
asked
in
order
to
avoid
answering
roommates
at
princeton
he
replied
those
were
the
good
old
days
there
never
was
a
more
popular
man
in
college
than
old
bill
i
basked
in
reflected
glory
all
the
time
he
was
always
the
king
pin
among
us
whether
it
was
football
or
writing
skits
or
drumming
the
piano
you
must
have
a
lot
in
common
i
suggested
especially
your
poetry
wright
round
blue
eyes
grew
rounder
than
ever
he
told
you
he
gasped
certainly
i
said
smiling
to
cover
the
pain
in
my
heart
did
you
think
he
could
keep
it
from
me
besides
i
it
all
the
time
i
told
bill
that
said
my
guest
triumphantly
and
then
as
bill
emerged
from
my
room
gingerly
carrying
the
hat
as
if
it
were
a
species
of
lavender
lydite
well
richard
warren
i
suppose
by
now
your
wife
is
your
severest
critic
the
hat
fluttered
from
bill
grasp
i
shrieked
but
he
caught
it
again
deftly
here
you
are
he
said
handing
it
to
me
and
went
on
my
kindest
critic
you
mean
but
my
critic
always
what
do
you
think
of
the
new
book
asked
wright
of
me
as
stopping
only
to
collect
peterkins
we
went
from
the
house
down
the
long
avenue
of
palms
i
only
seen
a
bit
but
i
tell
him
it
better
than
the
first
surer
more
mature
bigger
in
every
way
she
has
seen
it
answered
bill
hastily
i
do
want
her
to
for
a
while
yet
oh
wright
nodded
understandingly
i
see
just
what
he
saw
was
beyond
me
but
i
said
with
a
little
sigh
i
so
impatient
you
could
be
that
said
my
husband
not
even
when
it
comes
to
my
new
book
very
pretty
observed
wright
regarding
us
both
impartially
is
she
this
was
too
much
i
turned
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
our
coming
dinner
party
and
to
a
discussion
of
but
all
through
that
afternoon
through
the
banter
the
sparkling
surface
talk
of
dinner
that
night
through
the
hours
before
i
fell
asleep
i
was
trying
to
adjust
myself
to
the
fact
that
it
was
after
all
bill
who
had
written
lyric
who
had
so
beautifully
said
so
many
true
and
lovely
things
who
was
a
very
poet
no
matter
how
little
of
his
real
self
he
had
shown
me
in
his
letters
regardless
of
the
obvious
misfit
of
his
poems
and
his
living
personality
he
had
written
those
poems
they
were
his
and
they
must
have
sprung
from
some
eternal
and
true
fount
of
beauty
in
his
nature
or
else
all
books
lied
and
all
the
poets
who
ever
lived
to
gladden
the
world
with
their
songs
were
tricksters
and
jesters
with
a
command
of
rythmical
english
and
no
more
i
could
not
believe
that
and
so
i
must
believe
that
my
husband
had
written
truly
and
sung
faithfully
from
his
heart
and
that
is
what
i
could
not
understand
could
not
reconcile
with
him
himself
he
had
hurt
me
had
wounded
my
pride
beyond
endurance
i
hated
him
i
wished
myself
free
of
his
mere
presence
but
i
was
in
the
last
analysis
forced
to
admit
his
genius
and
forced
to
acknowledge
his
power
richard
warren
had
never
existed
not
the
richard
warren
i
had
built
up
from
a
slender
volume
of
verse
and
a
of
letters
but
william
denton
did
exist
very
solidly
and
for
me
distastefully
and
william
denton
had
written
lyric
it
may
not
be
difficult
given
certain
conditions
to
hate
a
poet
but
it
seemed
too
bad
the
following
night
our
very
informal
dinner
took
place
we
had
asked
some
other
people
to
make
up
a
party
of
ten
and
so
we
had
quite
a
formidable
array
of
valor
and
beauty
around
the
long
refectory
table
and
howells
and
their
daughter
the
chinese
minister
and
his
wife
bobby
willard
and
his
sister
ruth
wright
bill
and
myself
all
rather
diplomatically
placed
made
up
the
group
it
was
a
rather
amusing
and
incidentally
an
excellent
meal
over
the
massed
orchids
on
the
table
i
could
see
wright
almost
feverishly
attentive
alternately
to
ruth
willard
in
on
his
left
and
to
mercedes
in
an
amazing
frock
of
black
lace
a
cluster
of
orange
flowers
at
her
girdle
seated
between
him
and
my
husband
at
my
end
of
the
table
i
had
howells
and
the
courteous
gentleman
from
the
orient
and
howells
at
bill
right
watched
indolently
her
daughter
radiant
progress
and
applied
herself
mutely
to
the
business
of
eating
in
consequence
mercedes
during
the
greater
part
of
the
meal
drove
tandem
and
it
was
really
pretty
to
watch
only
by
the
salad
course
it
had
grown
monotonous
after
dinner
we
had
two
tables
of
bridge
fortunately
i
played
rather
a
good
game
father
having
taught
me
patiently
in
order
to
provide
one
more
during
my
as
we
were
ten
two
were
left
to
play
the
piano
to
sit
out
on
the
verandah
to
stroll
about
the
grounds
i
had
cleverly
manoeuvered
that
wright
and
ruth
be
left
but
something
went
wrong
and
bill
announcing
that
he
did
not
care
to
play
was
joined
by
mercedes
who
insisted
that
the
only
rule
she
knew
was
not
to
trump
her
partner
ace
i
fancied
however
that
she
was
well
equipped
with
the
finesse
instinct
and
even
that
i
often
forget
she
said
laughing
me
i
have
so
little
use
for
rules
so
it
eventually
and
naturally
came
about
that
bill
and
mercedes
stayed
out
of
the
game
joined
now
and
then
by
whoever
was
dummy
for
a
while
they
remained
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
at
the
piano
bill
black
and
white
in
his
dinner
clothes
dreaming
over
the
keys
mercedes
leaning
on
the
piano
her
huge
orange
feather
fan
at
her
lips
singing
snatches
of
spanish
songs
from
behind
its
shelter
her
dark
eyes
glowing
it
was
i
was
forced
to
admit
to
howells
playing
at
my
table
a
pretty
picture
softened
and
romantic
in
the
flicker
of
fire
light
which
shone
over
the
two
and
danced
on
the
mahogany
case
of
the
steinway
later
they
went
out
wright
followed
them
presently
in
his
momentary
freedom
as
dummy
for
a
breath
of
air
and
a
cigarette
i
made
a
grand
slam
wright
returning
to
take
his
place
paused
to
regard
the
score
over
my
shoulder
and
to
whisper
is
that
the
girl
bill
picked
out
for
me
what
does
he
take
me
for
a
hush
i
said
conscious
of
howells
proximity
but
she
was
criticizing
her
husband
last
play
and
did
not
hear
us
it
was
twelve
before
our
guests
left
mercedes
in
a
gorgeous
black
and
orange
cloak
seemed
reluctant
to
depart
i
had
a
wonderful
evening
she
told
me
and
billy
was
entertaining
i
had
always
disliked
the
schoolgirl
manner
of
talking
in
exclamations
and
italics
wright
bidding
me
remarked
with
mock
gravity
i
going
to
buy
a
whip
and
a
gun
tomorrow
mavis
that
howells
girl
needs
a
dressing
down
dressing
down
i
asked
not
a
little
maliciously
recalling
with
inner
amusement
mercedes
somewhat
revealing
gown
but
if
wright
did
not
understand
me
as
i
hoped
he
would
not
my
husband
did
and
his
inevitable
meow
followed
me
into
my
room
and
lingered
there
for
some
time
war
to
the
knife
chapter
xiv
guayabal
cuba
and
heaven
knows
what
date
father
dearest
we
have
enjoyed
your
letters
so
much
and
i
am
glad
that
you
have
uncle
john
to
bear
you
out
in
your
statements
that
you
are
almost
well
and
strong
again
otherwise
it
would
seem
too
good
to
be
true
what
a
fright
you
gave
us
all
you
dear
daddy
it
is
perfect
here
if
only
you
were
with
us
i
would
be
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
peter
is
all
better
again
i
hope
i
shall
never
live
through
another
night
like
the
one
when
we
nearly
lost
him
bill
is
wonderful
with
children
i
never
saw
such
patience
and
tenderness
and
sanity
we
see
quite
a
lot
of
mercedes
i
am
sure
she
would
enchant
you
she
is
so
pretty
but
i
should
be
jealous
you
know
if
she
ever
adopted
you
as
a
second
father
as
she
threatened
to
do
when
i
showed
her
your
picture
your
picture
by
the
way
is
the
next
thing
to
the
flesh
and
blood
you
i
talk
to
it
by
the
hour
bill
has
confessed
the
richard
warren
hoax
quite
involuntarily
i
must
admit
surprise
but
of
course
i
am
terrifically
proud
of
him
and
you
knew
all
along
you
wretch
and
never
told
me
it
was
amusing
of
you
to
scold
me
for
not
going
to
the
races
but
crowds
the
bare
idea
of
them
confused
me
so
however
bill
insisted
upon
reading
that
part
of
your
letter
and
carried
me
off
on
your
authority
if
you
please
to
sit
for
hours
in
a
funny
little
box
and
watch
the
people
and
the
horses
and
smell
the
track
and
disgrace
myself
by
rising
suddenly
and
shouting
as
my
horse
came
in
i
won
twelve
dollars
and
am
very
haughty
about
it
i
think
if
i
had
ever
seen
a
while
i
was
ill
could
such
a
thing
have
happened
i
would
have
died
such
sheer
wonderful
poetry
of
motion
bill
laughed
at
me
and
promises
me
more
thrills
when
the
racing
season
is
on
in
new
york
he
says
the
cuban
race
horses
are
a
lot
of
junk
but
he
does
realize
what
it
meant
to
me
no
one
can
realize
what
it
means
to
me
to
be
unfettered
to
walk
to
feel
well
to
be
hostess
in
my
own
borrowed
home
be
like
other
it
is
no
longer
a
miracle
of
course
nothing
is
for
very
long
except
perhaps
life
and
i
look
back
on
all
my
invalid
years
with
amazement
it
seems
a
dream
a
fantasy
remote
and
impossible
it
is
as
though
i
had
always
lived
as
now
really
daddy
dearest
my
letters
are
terribly
long
and
i
write
you
much
oftener
than
you
me
we
all
send
our
love
peter
and
i
go
further
we
send
kisses
stay
safe
stay
well
and
write
to
your
happy
mavis
sunset
lake
somewhere
in
canada
we
have
no
calendar
here
my
small
enchanting
daughter
and
so
there
are
no
such
things
as
dates
only
nights
and
days
and
splendid
undivided
hours
i
was
happy
to
have
your
letter
and
you
must
not
worry
about
me
i
feel
twenty
years
younger
and
so
john
says
look
it
you
will
not
know
your
old
dad
when
you
see
him
i
miss
you
my
dear
this
is
our
first
separation
i
could
not
stand
another
i
hope
that
you
have
persuaded
bill
that
my
home
must
still
be
your
home
when
we
are
all
together
again
at
first
it
seemed
unwise
two
young
things
starting
out
in
life
saddled
with
the
presence
of
a
third
person
for
i
am
a
third
person
now
it
is
right
that
i
should
be
but
i
am
very
selfish
i
want
to
enjoy
my
girl
this
new
wonderful
manifestation
of
her
and
there
is
room
in
the
old
house
for
us
all
you
may
tinker
with
it
as
you
please
add
where
you
will
and
i
will
keep
from
under
your
feet
i
am
certain
that
bill
will
have
all
the
practice
he
needs
to
keep
him
from
getting
rusty
even
in
green
hill
and
good
old
mac
is
quite
ready
to
abdicate
in
his
favor
how
splendidly
it
has
all
worked
out
never
a
day
passes
that
i
do
not
thank
god
for
your
health
for
your
happiness
and
for
my
own
reprieve
give
my
love
to
my
i
will
answer
his
letter
shortly
tell
peter
i
a
present
for
him
we
a
guide
up
here
who
is
a
genius
with
a
and
a
scrap
of
wood
and
inform
sarah
that
the
last
of
her
you
sent
me
is
a
marvel
she
entirely
too
rejuvenated
for
green
hill
to
you
my
child
the
tenderest
affection
of
your
devoted
father
i
think
perhaps
that
the
hardest
task
i
had
during
the
lazy
days
in
cuba
was
writing
to
father
there
were
times
when
the
irony
of
the
situation
moved
me
to
something
very
like
laughter
a
bitter
form
of
mirth
and
one
i
never
thought
to
know
as
carefully
as
any
novelist
i
built
up
my
little
fictionary
happiness
evolved
my
plot
drew
my
characters
retaining
enough
of
truth
and
committing
seven
times
seven
sins
of
omission
it
seemed
to
me
at
times
that
it
was
not
i
who
wrote
but
another
mavis
a
happy
mavis
living
in
a
tropical
dream
companioned
and
at
peace
the
mavis
i
might
have
been
if
what
tears
my
guardian
angel
must
have
shed
what
blotted
pages
must
have
soiled
the
ledger
i
wondered
very
often
if
lies
we
tell
to
spare
others
are
counted
lies
in
the
heavenly
books
after
all
surely
we
are
not
judged
by
earthly
standards
there
must
be
a
larger
vision
and
a
more
tolerant
viewpoint
and
sometimes
where
the
truth
ended
and
where
falsehood
began
seemed
hidden
from
me
times
when
the
dream
seemed
real
and
reality
a
dream
chapter
xv
sometimes
i
think
it
would
be
sweet
to
go
out
as
a
candle
in
the
wind
whose
little
flame
flares
up
in
brilliance
fleet
to
light
the
secret
corners
of
the
mind
and
calls
to
being
for
a
space
loves
and
dreams
illuminate
the
household
furniture
of
that
small
place
where
life
has
dwelt
old
hate
young
brave
belief
hopes
and
fears
the
driftwood
memories
grey
ghosts
of
pain
which
haunt
us
down
the
long
relentless
years
all
salient
living
vivid
once
again
in
that
last
eager
leaping
ray
of
light
which
snuffs
out
in
the
passing
of
a
breath
from
windows
open
to
the
healing
night
from
the
quiet
wind
of
death
a
throbbing
moment
wherein
all
things
cease
a
sudden
plunging
into
kindly
gloom
a
blessed
darkness
and
a
perfect
peace
and
utter
silence
in
an
empty
room
i
had
gone
with
my
writing
things
to
heap
pillows
on
the
lawn
beneath
that
curious
tropical
sabre
tree
which
is
entirely
covered
with
thick
wicked
spikes
magnified
and
dangerous
thorns
this
tree
wears
smooth
with
age
they
say
like
a
number
of
human
beings
perhaps
and
the
natives
hold
it
in
superstitious
awe
believing
it
to
be
the
tree
which
formed
the
cross
they
will
not
cut
one
down
or
in
any
way
deface
it
lying
prone
elbows
propped
on
my
gay
cushion
my
chin
in
my
hands
i
contemplated
the
last
verse
i
had
made
considered
a
title
decided
on
ultimus
and
then
weighting
the
sheet
with
a
round
yellow
orange
i
rolled
over
on
my
back
and
crossing
my
arms
beneath
my
head
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
was
a
wonderful
morning
cloudless
perfect
not
too
oppressively
warm
and
it
was
the
first
breathing
spell
i
had
had
in
several
days
the
business
of
having
as
a
house
guest
an
eligible
young
bachelor
of
charm
and
astonishing
vitality
was
a
little
wearing
and
i
was
glad
when
the
day
came
on
which
wright
concluded
that
an
hour
or
so
in
the
saddle
with
bill
as
escort
would
be
both
beneficial
to
his
constitution
and
instructive
mentally
quite
aside
from
the
arduous
task
of
exhibiting
havana
and
environs
to
a
tireless
young
man
the
effort
of
keeping
up
appearances
had
really
begun
to
tell
on
me
wright
was
particularly
and
i
more
than
once
fancied
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
black
waters
under
the
thin
verbal
ice
upon
which
bill
and
i
so
carelessly
skated
my
husband
and
i
had
not
been
alone
together
since
the
arrival
of
his
friend
i
had
seen
to
that
when
we
were
not
in
havana
or
at
the
country
club
there
were
people
at
the
palms
and
to
insure
perfect
satisfaction
for
everyone
concerned
i
had
asked
mercedes
howells
to
bring
a
bag
and
spend
a
few
days
in
the
country
she
had
accepted
with
alacrity
and
there
remained
to
me
but
a
few
hours
of
comparative
peace
before
she
descended
upon
the
household
i
looked
across
at
the
mountains
purple
blue
they
were
against
a
marvelous
sky
the
air
was
very
still
i
could
hear
arthur
shrieking
from
the
house
he
had
learned
a
number
of
fine
oaths
lately
and
was
employing
them
in
his
most
wheedling
manner
on
nora
the
went
by
on
the
road
below
a
bird
swayed
on
the
bourganvilla
vine
and
sang
down
in
the
i
saw
the
flick
of
a
peacock
tail
and
the
orchids
themselves
like
lavender
birds
in
the
distance
flowering
from
the
smooth
palm
trunks
my
eyes
closed
and
i
slept
when
i
awoke
someone
was
sitting
beside
me
whistling
sally
in
our
alley
i
saw
puttees
and
riding
breeches
a
hand
holding
a
cigarette
and
finally
a
blonde
countenance
which
was
turned
upward
to
the
sky
hello
i
said
how
long
have
you
been
here
hours
he
answered
mavis
denton
you
talk
in
your
sleep
you
do
somethin
awful
i
sat
up
abruptly
what
did
i
say
i
demanded
first
you
snored
some
i
do
snore
you
do
bill
told
me
so
he
says
to
me
you
never
marry
a
girl
who
snores
there
was
no
use
arguing
with
wright
in
a
silly
mood
go
on
i
said
resigned
to
heaven
alone
knew
what
eccentricities
of
speech
and
disclosure
i
going
first
you
snores
a
bit
as
i
remarked
before
i
was
so
rudely
interrupted
who
raised
you
anyway
mavis
do
you
know
little
girls
must
never
contradict
interrupt
or
otherwise
distract
old
gentlemen
well
after
the
snore
musical
it
was
you
says
you
says
right
out
loud
and
then
just
like
a
movie
heroine
you
shouts
and
you
clinched
your
hands
and
ground
your
teeth
as
no
lady
had
oughter
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
silly
i
said
you
making
it
all
up
wright
laughed
i
not
truly
he
said
although
perhaps
i
have
rendered
it
in
a
slightly
more
lurid
manner
than
you
did
but
it
true
and
i
going
to
ask
bill
what
it
all
about
so
there
do
you
dare
i
said
all
right
i
wo
if
you
will
promise
me
never
to
blush
again
like
you
have
been
doing
for
the
last
three
minutes
it
is
very
disturbing
to
a
struggling
poet
who
has
long
sought
fresher
similes
for
dawn
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
provided
the
simile
all
right
but
who
in
time
could
rhyme
with
mavis
at
the
mention
of
poetry
my
hand
unconsciously
went
toward
the
sheet
of
paper
beside
me
the
orange
rolled
away
and
the
wind
provokingly
caught
the
paper
and
fluttered
it
what
this
said
the
audacious
youth
beside
me
ha
i
see
fine
italian
hand
in
this
he
picked
up
the
paper
regardless
of
my
pleas
and
scanned
it
with
a
practised
eye
your
writing
amanuensis
now
eh
hm
that
does
sound
like
bill
wait
a
moment
i
never
saw
such
illegible
calligraphy
at
least
one
member
of
a
doctor
family
ought
to
write
so
a
fellow
can
read
it
he
laid
the
paper
down
bill
did
write
that
he
said
suddenly
serious
who
did
you
mavis
i
nodded
why
you
little
wretch
he
cried
out
delightedly
bill
never
told
me
a
word
he
does
know
i
said
knows
please
do
tell
him
i
had
thought
of
some
day
showing
what
i
had
done
to
uncle
john
denton
but
i
decided
not
to
now
i
did
mean
anyone
to
know
wright
picked
up
the
paper
and
read
the
verse
again
i
watched
him
in
a
curious
mental
state
part
of
me
resented
bitterly
that
even
so
good
a
friend
should
have
dragged
out
to
the
revealing
light
of
day
my
wistful
secret
of
song
and
yet
another
part
of
me
back
in
my
brain
said
dully
it
really
does
matter
now
i
a
better
critic
than
i
am
a
poet
said
wright
after
a
time
i
think
you
have
a
gift
mavis
this
he
flicked
the
paper
with
a
thumb
and
finger
has
grace
and
delicacy
it
not
good
of
course
not
according
to
well
say
bill
standards
but
it
has
promise
i
wo
tell
bill
if
you
rather
not
although
i
think
he
would
help
you
a
great
deal
and
i
sure
he
go
quite
out
of
his
head
with
excitement
may
i
see
sometime
anything
else
you
have
only
for
the
love
of
mike
what
the
idea
of
being
so
morbid
have
you
happier
things
to
write
about
child
i
put
my
hand
over
his
sure
you
wo
tell
i
begged
i
swear
by
all
the
muses
he
replied
bill
shall
never
know
from
me
know
what
asked
bill
appearing
disconcertingly
around
the
tree
i
snatched
my
hand
from
wright
and
felt
myself
grow
scarlet
we
must
both
have
looked
guilty
for
wright
guileless
blonde
face
reflected
my
embarrassment
secret
said
wright
firmly
oh
i
see
bill
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
to
the
paper
in
hand
and
then
considerately
walked
off
lunch
is
ready
he
remarked
over
his
shoulder
been
calling
you
for
about
ten
minutes
wright
helped
me
to
my
feet
close
call
he
said
hush
i
said
for
my
husband
was
still
within
is
he
always
like
that
asked
wright
anxiously
as
we
went
toward
the
house
like
what
i
asked
in
all
innocence
positively
with
rage
if
you
are
alone
for
half
a
minute
with
another
man
even
so
harmless
a
specimen
as
myself
do
be
silly
said
i
with
finality
i
not
and
if
he
is
going
to
be
jealous
as
all
that
why
do
you
get
to
him
first
before
he
can
accuse
you
and
demand
that
he
cease
baying
at
the
moon
with
that
human
leopardess
who
vamps
around
these
diggings
she
be
here
this
afternoon
on
a
visit
i
announced
laughing
why
do
you
monopolize
her
yourself
i
never
went
in
for
that
kind
said
wright
with
firmness
i
might
get
scratched
gentle
and
that
my
type
besides
miss
howells
is
going
to
look
just
like
her
mother
and
that
a
warning
to
any
man
that
afternoon
mercedes
arrived
her
bag
proved
to
be
a
trunk
and
within
an
hour
of
her
arrival
she
had
charmed
the
kitchen
made
eyes
at
silas
called
wright
by
his
first
name
hurt
her
finger
with
resultant
medical
attention
and
confided
to
me
that
she
hated
men
after
which
she
departed
in
the
direction
of
the
with
billy
and
wright
i
went
to
her
room
and
viewed
her
gowns
hanging
like
flowers
in
her
innovation
after
which
i
went
to
my
own
room
and
took
stock
of
my
chiffon
and
satin
armor
bill
came
back
at
tea
time
wright
is
reciting
poetry
to
mercedes
on
the
stone
bench
under
the
orchids
and
sketching
her
between
verses
he
announced
but
i
crave
more
material
food
you
might
have
stayed
on
i
suggested
passing
him
the
sandwiches
and
made
the
recitation
competitive
competitive
he
remarked
choosing
a
ripe
red
disk
of
tomato
flanked
with
thin
circles
of
bread
and
biting
into
it
reflectively
calls
for
numbers
i
do
enjoy
being
part
of
a
or
a
here
comes
the
meistersänger
i
said
as
wright
came
up
the
steps
with
mercedes
unnecessarily
on
his
arm
selecting
chairs
cups
plates
and
food
our
guests
joined
us
around
the
wicker
he
is
not
a
nice
young
man
at
all
said
mercedes
frankly
exhibiting
a
rather
clever
little
pastel
of
herself
this
wright
he
says
to
me
the
most
beautiful
poetry
so
sad
and
so
lovely
all
about
unrequited
love
and
dead
girls
floating
in
moonlit
pools
and
when
touched
to
the
heart
i
weep
a
little
he
laughs
and
says
it
is
wonderful
how
much
tragedy
one
can
turn
out
at
fifty
cents
a
line
she
opened
ocular
fire
on
her
host
as
she
spoke
and
bill
responded
nicely
i
sure
he
said
gravely
that
wright
will
have
plenty
of
happier
inspiration
now
and
said
wright
to
me
under
his
breath
in
all
justice
one
must
concede
her
a
certain
amount
of
beauty
i
do
think
she
going
to
look
like
her
mother
after
all
whispering
rude
said
mercedes
severely
is
it
billy
so
the
conversation
became
general
again
at
six
bill
drove
over
to
the
neighboring
plantation
to
fetch
peterkins
who
had
spent
the
day
there
with
the
crowell
children
back
to
supper
when
he
returned
he
looked
rather
serious
what
up
asked
wright
idly
from
the
canvas
verandah
swing
nothing
much
he
answered
that
is
not
yet
run
along
to
sarah
peter
there
a
good
fellow
but
i
knew
that
something
was
wrong
and
after
the
child
had
left
us
i
asked
quietly
tell
us
bill
please
crowell
been
having
some
trouble
with
the
natives
he
answered
frowning
it
may
blow
over
and
it
may
spread
they
like
a
lot
of
sheep
but
i
feel
responsible
to
reynolds
even
if
silas
is
in
charge
the
people
have
a
healthy
respect
for
silas
and
they
trust
him
but
what
sort
of
trouble
asked
wright
practically
oh
threats
and
little
gatherings
and
demonstrations
they
are
always
restless
and
the
slightest
thing
sets
them
off
crowell
discharged
one
of
his
surliest
men
the
other
day
unfortunately
the
chap
is
related
to
half
guayabal
we
some
of
his
cousins
and
brothers
and
uncles
on
this
place
i
suppose
anyway
this
miguel
person
has
been
going
about
trying
to
incite
the
people
to
open
enmity
against
the
resident
americans
of
course
it
probably
wo
amount
to
a
hill
of
beans
but
you
never
know
where
you
stand
have
they
just
finished
a
revolution
here
asked
wright
seems
to
me
i
read
something
about
it
there
are
always
uprisings
answered
mercedes
covering
a
yawn
generally
in
the
eastern
districts
nearer
santiago
they
are
like
children
these
people
she
turned
with
a
shrug
which
dismissed
the
subject
to
bill
come
she
urged
prettily
play
my
accompaniment
for
me
i
want
to
sing
you
some
of
the
old
songs
my
little
spanish
grandmother
taught
her
grandchildren
we
had
a
little
while
before
we
need
dress
for
dinner
and
so
bill
followed
her
obediently
into
the
and
presently
her
light
sweet
voice
floated
out
to
wright
and
me
on
the
verandah
sings
well
does
she
said
wright
but
i
was
not
attending
does
bill
seem
worried
to
you
i
asked
more
casually
than
my
mental
state
warranted
who
bill
why
no
i
do
think
so
he
answered
absently
probably
put
all
this
native
business
out
of
his
head
by
now
not
an
alarmist
wonder
what
that
song
is
quaint
is
it
but
i
was
not
satisfied
and
after
dinner
i
deliberately
found
an
opportunity
contrary
to
custom
to
speak
with
my
husband
alone
about
the
crowell
plantation
i
said
is
there
any
danger
to
them
from
the
natives
to
us
there
is
always
more
or
less
danger
he
answered
with
the
formal
courtesy
which
had
recently
characterized
all
of
our
infrequent
unattended
encounters
but
i
do
not
think
we
need
worry
still
i
shall
forbid
peter
to
go
out
in
the
fields
or
beyond
the
house
alone
and
i
must
ask
you
also
to
be
careful
i
sorry
to
curtail
your
freedom
but
if
you
do
mind
perversely
i
suddenly
minded
very
much
i
wo
run
any
risks
i
answered
with
mental
reservations
there
you
two
are
again
sneaking
off
whispering
heads
together
are
you
just
a
little
tired
of
twosing
by
now
it
was
wright
coming
up
behind
us
i
thought
i
detected
a
little
cynical
gleam
in
mercedes
eyes
and
laid
my
hand
defiantly
on
arm
are
tired
i
asked
him
gaily
he
laid
his
free
hand
over
mine
do
men
tire
of
life
he
counter
questioned
gallantly
and
i
knew
a
swift
admiration
for
his
histrionic
powers
for
his
voice
went
a
little
deep
quite
suddenly
and
the
hand
over
mine
shook
nice
answer
said
wright
critically
quite
emotional
but
open
to
argument
of
course
men
tire
of
life
some
of
them
commit
suicide
some
of
them
drink
others
get
married
the
remedy
is
entirely
according
to
temperament
horrid
man
said
mercedes
pouting
and
answering
amiably
am
i
not
wright
guided
her
to
the
bridge
table
having
persuaded
her
at
dinner
that
with
him
as
partner
she
could
trump
his
ace
to
her
heart
content
as
we
followed
them
bill
said
very
low
remember
not
to
go
out
alone
mavis
i
remember
i
answered
and
we
sat
down
to
the
cards
it
was
interesting
to
observe
that
mercedes
her
previous
assertions
to
the
contrary
played
a
much
better
game
than
any
of
us
excepting
perhaps
bill
so
after
all
it
had
been
from
choice
and
not
lack
of
knowledge
that
she
had
not
joined
the
game
the
night
of
the
dinner
which
looked
as
if
someone
else
had
been
manoeuvering
besides
myself
but
i
forgave
her
she
was
so
pretty
that
one
could
not
expect
her
to
always
play
quite
according
to
hoyle
chapter
xvi
i
arrived
in
the
kitchen
the
following
morning
to
discuss
luncheon
with
norah
and
found
the
entire
massed
at
the
watching
mercedes
coquetting
with
arthur
there
was
a
temptation
to
draw
an
analogy
between
the
bird
and
the
decorative
girl
who
stood
at
the
poking
her
white
fingers
perilously
through
the
wiring
and
cooing
to
him
in
softest
spanish
it
must
be
admitted
that
weeks
of
painstaking
effort
on
my
part
to
win
arthur
to
a
display
of
friendliness
toward
me
had
resulted
in
nothing
but
ten
minutes
with
mercedes
had
proved
his
undoing
the
bird
was
positively
maudlin
i
came
out
to
the
cage
and
at
once
the
orbs
of
arthur
underwent
an
unflattering
change
he
opened
them
to
their
widest
and
bleakest
and
said
hoarsely
sarcastic
pretty
darling
darling
carramba
at
which
mercedes
exclaimed
delightedly
oh
is
he
clever
who
taught
him
that
the
swearing
or
the
pet
names
i
answered
stooping
to
say
goodmorning
to
wiggles
i
have
the
remotest
idea
billy
suggested
my
guest
touching
her
perfectly
dressed
hair
with
highly
manicured
possibly
i
answered
he
invariably
barks
and
then
swears
at
me
before
luncheon
billy
or
arthur
inquired
mercedes
with
interest
i
laughed
have
you
seen
either
of
the
men
this
morning
i
asked
i
heard
them
go
out
early
they
went
to
crowell
she
answered
i
saw
them
off
they
will
not
be
back
before
tea
billy
told
me
i
tried
to
look
as
if
i
had
heard
these
plans
before
and
merely
forgotten
them
for
a
moment
how
nice
i
said
insincerely
we
will
have
a
nice
long
day
together
with
no
disturbing
male
element
i
added
maliciously
i
will
like
that
too
said
mercedes
with
great
unexpectedness
you
never
let
me
talk
to
you
alone
mavis
and
she
finished
with
a
funny
little
undercurrent
of
wistfulness
in
her
pretty
voice
i
have
no
friends
my
own
age
women
friends
i
mean
i
had
grown
to
be
a
little
annoyed
at
my
guest
but
somehow
her
simple
statement
opened
up
a
vista
before
me
which
i
had
not
dreamed
existed
the
child
seemed
after
all
hungry
for
companionship
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
find
it
with
her
own
indolent
mother
who
treated
her
as
if
she
were
half
plaything
and
half
infant
or
with
her
father
whose
attitude
toward
her
was
a
curious
commingling
of
affectionate
despotism
and
anxiety
and
the
basis
on
which
she
met
all
her
many
was
not
one
guaranteed
to
produce
comradeship
i
put
my
arm
through
hers
and
took
her
into
the
kitchen
with
me
after
my
inconsiderable
domestic
task
was
completed
we
went
out
on
the
verandah
together
armed
with
sewing
mercedes
sewed
beautifully
an
art
which
her
early
convent
education
had
taught
her
and
i
took
a
real
aesthetic
pleasure
in
watching
the
smooth
dark
head
bent
over
the
fine
linen
in
her
lap
what
are
you
making
i
asked
her
idly
she
exhibited
the
very
feminine
garment
exquisitely
embroidered
and
sewn
with
the
most
exact
and
even
of
tiny
stitches
i
wish
i
could
sew
like
that
i
said
enviously
but
i
should
think
you
would
ruin
your
eyes
she
raised
to
mine
the
tremendous
pools
of
liquid
darkness
in
question
but
no
she
said
all
spanish
girls
are
clever
with
the
needle
the
sisters
taught
me
when
i
was
very
young
i
had
been
with
the
howells
to
one
of
the
convents
near
havana
and
i
recalled
now
the
sweet
patient
faces
of
the
nuns
and
the
marvelous
work
they
showed
us
some
of
it
lay
in
one
of
my
trunks
now
a
present
to
goodrich
from
bill
and
me
the
thought
of
mercedes
behind
the
austere
cloister
walls
was
incongruous
were
you
long
with
the
nuns
i
asked
her
seven
years
she
answered
and
then
amazingly
i
was
very
happy
there
for
a
long
time
i
wanted
to
take
the
veil
but
father
was
simply
horrified
at
the
idea
i
was
somewhat
horrified
myself
i
ca
imagine
it
i
said
flatly
why
i
did
answer
for
a
moment
and
she
went
on
but
i
know
why
you
think
me
very
light
and
frivolous
do
you
not
mavis
it
would
be
difficult
i
answered
cautiously
to
imagine
you
as
a
nun
they
are
good
women
she
said
and
was
silent
suddenly
i
realized
that
i
knew
very
little
more
about
this
girl
than
i
had
known
on
the
boat
coming
down
to
havana
and
yet
i
had
been
with
her
almost
constantly
ever
since
did
you
care
for
college
i
inquired
rather
diffidently
her
great
eyes
lighted
up
it
was
wonderful
in
some
ways
she
said
slowly
so
many
girls
of
all
classes
gathered
together
at
first
i
could
not
understand
at
home
you
know
one
is
very
careful
whom
one
knows
it
is
changing
a
little
now
i
remember
i
was
scandalized
my
first
months
at
college
to
find
that
the
president
of
the
senior
class
was
a
waitress
in
one
of
the
campus
houses
actually
waiting
on
the
table
it
was
too
incredible
i
wrote
home
and
mother
begged
father
to
send
for
me
at
once
she
was
even
more
shocked
than
i
but
father
laughed
she
said
and
told
her
it
would
do
me
good
he
said
it
was
high
time
that
a
little
of
my
american
blood
came
to
the
fore
later
i
learned
that
this
girl
the
senior
president
had
practically
worked
her
way
through
the
four
years
of
college
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
very
poor
man
a
peasant
we
would
call
him
and
yet
there
was
hardly
a
girl
in
that
great
college
who
would
not
have
given
everything
she
had
for
the
respect
and
admiration
and
love
which
that
quiet
girl
had
won
and
held
from
students
and
faculty
alike
you
too
i
asked
i
too
said
mercedes
simply
she
bent
her
head
a
little
lower
over
the
white
fabric
in
her
lap
and
went
on
not
quite
clearly
i
was
not
very
popular
some
liked
me
yes
they
even
asked
me
to
their
homes
for
the
shorter
vacations
but
they
liked
me
because
i
was
because
it
was
to
say
that
they
had
a
girl
as
a
friend
or
because
i
was
pretty
and
bright
and
did
not
care
much
to
study
but
i
made
no
real
friendships
i
was
by
now
very
interested
here
was
a
of
life
that
i
had
no
knowledge
of
a
feeling
of
sympathy
stirred
in
me
this
gay
alien
little
creature
with
the
blood
of
two
widely
dissimilar
nations
warring
in
her
coming
fresh
from
her
convent
to
the
democratic
freedom
of
an
american
college
i
said
tell
me
a
little
about
it
all
mercedes
i
only
know
second
hand
for
as
perhaps
bill
has
told
you
i
was
a
helpless
invalid
for
eleven
years
but
i
was
fortunate
in
my
friends
although
i
had
few
of
my
own
age
and
in
a
father
who
was
my
greatest
playfellow
and
my
most
understanding
comrade
the
quick
facile
tears
rose
to
the
big
eyes
she
pulled
her
chair
a
little
closer
and
laid
her
warm
vibrant
hand
on
mine
i
did
know
she
said
i
so
sorry
billy
told
me
that
you
had
been
ill
but
i
did
you
wonderful
mavis
she
said
delicate
and
lovely
as
an
orchid
i
always
feel
clumsy
and
too
beside
you
and
you
have
been
so
kind
and
sweet
i
grew
very
remorseful
my
feelings
toward
mercedes
howells
had
been
anything
but
kind
and
sweet
they
had
been
distinctly
critical
and
almost
unfriendly
for
the
first
time
i
did
not
resent
her
easy
use
of
my
husband
given
name
for
the
first
time
i
realized
the
old
truth
that
to
know
people
is
to
like
them
i
gave
the
narrow
hand
a
little
squeeze
do
be
silly
child
i
said
lightly
and
tell
me
more
about
your
american
impressions
you
sound
just
like
the
reporter
who
came
on
the
boat
my
first
trip
north
said
mercedes
with
a
little
giggle
such
a
nice
young
man
but
the
things
he
put
in
the
paper
about
me
heiress
screams
with
delight
at
the
first
glimpse
of
her
father
country
i
did
really
scream
she
explained
conscientiously
but
i
talked
more
than
i
should
have
father
wrote
me
quite
an
angry
letter
about
it
he
is
very
well
known
she
added
without
pride
and
it
annoyed
him
he
says
no
woman
can
hold
her
tongue
anyway
but
how
was
i
to
know
that
the
nice
young
man
was
a
reporter
i
had
a
vision
of
mercedes
hands
flying
eyes
everywhere
babbling
and
bubbling
for
the
york
it
was
too
amusing
no
wonder
howells
had
been
go
on
i
said
encouragingly
the
girls
i
went
home
with
she
said
after
a
while
they
lived
in
wonderful
houses
and
had
such
beautiful
clothes
but
i
did
like
them
somehow
you
see
at
home
we
are
very
strictly
brought
up
after
a
girl
is
out
she
has
some
freedom
of
course
and
after
she
marries
it
is
quite
different
she
can
do
as
she
likes
and
until
father
had
insisted
upon
my
being
educated
in
the
states
my
mother
had
had
all
the
care
of
me
and
i
was
brought
up
as
the
spanish
girls
are
as
my
mother
was
in
her
own
madrid
these
american
girls
i
visited
thought
of
nothing
but
good
times
they
spoke
no
language
but
their
own
how
many
do
you
speak
mercedes
i
interrupted
curiously
english
spanish
french
of
course
she
answered
and
a
little
smattering
of
italian
and
german
i
had
governesses
until
i
was
ten
and
then
i
went
to
the
convent
and
much
emphasis
was
laid
on
languages
i
suppressed
a
gasp
and
she
went
on
it
was
from
them
my
college
friends
that
i
learned
that
it
is
easy
to
deceive
one
parents
and
that
it
is
quite
right
and
proper
to
have
as
many
cavaliers
as
one
can
they
called
it
i
thought
of
mercedes
not
inadept
efforts
along
the
line
of
scalps
and
thinking
asked
but
have
spanish
girls
and
girls
all
over
the
world
very
much
the
same
ambitions
along
that
line
mercedes
knitted
her
brows
and
as
she
looked
at
me
i
was
startled
for
for
the
first
time
i
saw
in
her
a
very
definite
resemblance
to
her
father
there
was
a
strength
of
jaw
there
to
which
the
rounded
soft
chin
had
blinded
me
a
certain
northern
keenness
in
the
southern
eyes
why
yes
she
answered
but
it
is
to
marry
that
they
shall
i
say
hunt
but
it
was
not
that
with
my
new
york
friends
they
had
no
desire
to
marry
many
of
them
told
me
that
they
would
hate
being
tied
down
that
they
disliked
children
no
it
was
not
to
marry
but
merely
to
play
and
to
be
amused
i
laughed
it
the
motive
then
i
said
that
makes
the
difference
in
your
eyes
of
course
she
said
frankly
to
marry
to
have
a
family
to
be
mistress
in
one
own
home
that
is
the
legitimate
ambition
of
every
woman
i
concluded
for
her
si
senora
she
answered
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
but
i
argued
you
must
have
met
other
american
girls
whose
interest
was
not
solely
centered
in
the
fine
art
of
flirtation
i
understood
them
those
you
speak
of
even
less
said
mercedes
guilelessly
my
roommate
was
such
a
one
she
wanted
to
be
an
engineer
just
fancy
and
she
was
so
pretty
too
an
engineer
i
ejaculated
for
even
to
my
american
mind
this
was
an
unusual
ambition
for
my
sex
to
harbor
and
she
had
no
use
for
men
too
i
asked
that
was
just
it
said
mercedes
in
obvious
wonderment
she
had
any
number
of
men
friends
corresponded
with
them
saw
them
at
dances
they
even
called
upon
her
at
college
but
a
flirt
she
was
not
they
were
her
friends
she
said
and
she
was
like
another
boy
with
them
i
went
to
her
home
once
a
little
town
in
massachusetts
and
i
could
not
understand
her
at
all
she
was
like
a
sister
to
her
mother
a
son
to
her
father
and
a
comrade
to
her
it
was
too
amazing
there
was
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
i
thought
she
could
understand
but
not
condone
the
promiscuous
flirtations
of
her
american
sisters
but
the
girl
who
was
comrade
to
a
man
and
friend
and
who
looked
on
him
as
such
and
not
as
an
extra
scalp
or
a
possible
husband
was
beyond
her
comprehension
but
i
argued
returning
to
the
butterflies
surely
mercedes
you
have
quite
as
much
freedom
now
as
any
american
girl
and
forgive
me
my
dear
but
you
employ
it
in
much
the
same
manner
her
glance
was
mischievous
and
rather
that
has
only
been
since
my
return
home
she
said
mother
is
not
pleased
but
father
says
her
go
ahead
and
as
to
what
you
say
i
am
trying
very
hard
to
be
american
now
not
the
comrade
sort
such
as
your
mechanical
roommate
i
suggested
she
regarded
me
in
amazement
but
most
of
the
men
i
meet
are
cubans
she
stated
do
you
think
would
understand
it
if
i
could
be
like
that
little
mary
adams
i
considered
shook
my
head
of
course
not
she
said
answering
her
own
question
they
would
laugh
and
shrug
and
be
perhaps
disagreeable
they
can
accept
such
a
manner
in
an
american
girl
they
do
not
like
it
or
comprehend
it
but
some
of
them
have
learned
their
lesson
and
they
must
respect
it
but
in
a
spanish
girl
it
would
be
unthinkable
besides
she
added
frankly
i
could
she
was
right
temperamentally
unfit
emotionally
too
highly
developed
and
as
to
the
flirting
she
said
shyly
i
i
like
to
attract
people
i
like
to
make
them
laugh
and
say
nice
things
and
perhaps
my
american
friends
have
taught
me
something
of
their
methods
and
your
motive
i
asked
she
stretched
her
graceful
arms
wide
her
hair
had
a
blue
sheen
in
the
shaded
light
of
the
verandah
and
her
skin
was
i
have
any
said
mercedes
frankly
not
even
a
small
gold
band
in
the
perspective
i
said
she
looked
down
at
her
ringless
hands
at
the
heap
of
fragrant
linen
lying
in
her
lap
this
is
to
be
part
of
my
trousseau
she
answered
indirectly
part
of
what
you
call
a
chest
all
girls
of
my
class
sew
a
great
deal
and
lay
it
all
away
until
they
marry
and
after
all
i
am
not
like
my
new
york
cousins
for
where
they
say
when
i
get
tired
of
playing
i
say
when
i
meet
the
right
man
and
so
you
see
i
am
not
like
my
mother
people
either
not
quite
for
they
say
when
my
parents
are
satisfied
and
let
us
hope
it
will
be
soon
i
did
wonder
that
bill
that
the
men
found
her
charming
the
mixture
of
innocence
and
sophistication
the
innate
and
the
acquired
worldliness
was
really
delicious
do
you
talk
to
many
people
like
this
i
asked
curiously
of
course
not
she
answered
i
know
of
no
one
who
would
understand
there
are
times
she
admitted
with
a
little
sigh
when
i
really
do
not
understand
myself
at
the
luncheon
table
i
found
myself
looking
at
mercedes
half
as
if
she
were
a
stranger
half
as
if
she
were
an
old
friend
i
envy
you
and
bill
mavis
she
said
once
when
fong
had
left
the
room
you
have
so
much
to
make
you
happy
he
a
very
lucky
man
i
smiled
it
was
not
a
subject
on
which
i
wished
to
be
interrogated
and
you
she
went
on
are
a
lucky
girl
he
awfully
fine
that
husband
of
yours
she
played
for
a
moment
with
her
and
looked
at
me
rather
pathetically
i
like
the
way
american
men
are
with
their
wives
she
said
i
wish
i
could
have
met
a
billy
i
might
have
responded
that
in
a
few
months
time
my
husband
would
be
legally
free
to
take
an
interest
in
such
remarks
but
i
refrained
you
must
have
met
a
number
of
men
in
two
years
i
said
not
billies
she
answered
firmly
awfully
young
they
were
and
she
paused
fong
came
in
just
then
and
the
conversation
took
a
more
discreet
turn
after
luncheon
in
the
two
big
swings
down
among
the
palms
i
brought
up
the
subject
again
so
after
all
i
said
the
man
must
be
an
american
mercedes
i
had
not
calculated
on
the
effect
of
my
idle
words
a
vivid
scarlet
spread
to
the
roots
of
the
black
hair
on
the
boat
she
answered
we
talked
your
bill
and
i
and
since
then
also
and
i
have
learned
a
little
of
the
reverence
for
women
that
your
fine
men
have
a
little
of
the
way
they
guard
and
protect
them
not
by
bars
and
bolts
and
commands
but
by
love
and
chivalry
and
thoughtfulness
i
have
seen
that
too
in
my
father
a
little
but
after
all
my
father
married
mother
and
so
it
is
different
with
him
and
he
has
never
talked
to
me
as
he
would
to
the
daughter
perhaps
of
an
american
wife
i
thought
of
my
own
father
and
knew
a
swift
pang
of
pity
for
this
rather
rudderless
little
craft
it
was
through
billy
that
i
got
to
know
you
mercedes
went
on
he
was
always
talking
about
you
and
you
you
always
held
me
off
something
very
warm
and
sweet
crept
into
my
heart
and
i
put
my
hand
out
across
the
space
between
i
sorry
i
said
awfully
sorry
mercedes
you
see
perhaps
i
was
quite
used
to
girls
you
really
be
my
friend
now
she
asked
naïvely
and
i
was
conscious
that
i
spoke
the
whole
truth
as
i
answered
i
am
your
friend
mercedes
never
doubt
it
our
hands
clasped
on
that
and
within
ten
minutes
her
quiet
breathing
told
me
that
she
slept
i
lay
awake
a
little
longer
thinking
very
hard
so
bill
had
really
seen
the
best
of
her
after
all
he
had
not
told
me
for
i
had
never
tried
to
know
even
second
hand
he
would
have
let
me
go
on
believing
the
girl
to
be
heartless
and
silly
and
nothing
else
it
was
not
fair
and
then
i
stopped
to
realize
that
i
had
not
to
believe
her
anything
else
before
i
fell
asleep
i
had
absolved
mercedes
howells
from
deliberately
trying
to
flirt
with
my
husband
she
would
have
been
my
friend
more
than
his
had
i
wished
her
to
be
failing
that
she
had
turned
to
the
person
who
oddly
enough
had
apparently
comprehended
her
little
complexities
i
looked
over
at
the
serene
face
the
heavy
white
lids
with
their
weight
of
dark
lashes
folded
over
the
big
eyes
a
little
smile
curved
the
lovely
full
mouth
and
she
slept
as
a
child
sleeps
one
hand
under
her
soft
cheek
it
was
very
still
the
palm
leaves
rustled
faintly
over
my
head
and
the
sunlight
fell
hot
and
golden
through
the
trees
my
eyes
closed
in
spite
of
myself
and
with
a
very
tender
impulse
toward
my
new
friend
i
turned
on
my
side
and
slept
chapter
xvii
what
are
you
two
girls
whispering
about
asked
wright
coming
up
behind
us
on
the
porch
of
the
country
club
it
is
none
of
your
affairs
responded
mercedes
with
dignity
but
as
you
are
so
rude
as
to
ask
i
will
tell
you
that
the
last
affair
of
the
season
is
to
be
held
at
the
home
of
consuelo
mendez
a
ball
next
week
and
i
have
asked
mavis
if
she
will
let
me
steal
you
for
the
evening
provided
you
have
no
objection
it
will
be
amusing
i
think
and
you
will
meet
many
pretty
girls
as
to
that
i
would
not
have
to
leave
guayabal
said
wright
politely
but
i
am
honored
that
you
implore
my
escort
implore
said
mercedes
with
scorn
be
careful
i
warned
she
withdraw
her
invitation
and
i
sure
you
have
a
wonderful
time
i
sha
go
of
course
although
senora
mendez
has
been
gracious
enough
to
include
me
in
the
invitation
and
bill
declares
he
is
too
old
for
such
festivities
but
i
have
told
mercedes
she
may
have
you
and
welcome
suggested
wright
tragically
i
shall
stop
on
at
palms
till
then
said
mercedes
mavis
has
asked
me
and
if
you
will
come
into
havana
with
me
the
day
of
the
dance
my
mother
will
be
very
glad
to
have
you
stay
with
us
over
that
night
for
it
will
be
a
late
party
of
course
too
late
for
you
to
return
to
guayabal
bully
said
wright
with
enthusiasm
i
love
it
what
does
one
wear
he
asked
anxiously
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
answered
bill
appearing
from
the
locker
rooms
wright
thinks
said
mercedes
pensively
that
at
an
affair
almost
entirely
within
the
set
the
gentlemen
appear
attired
as
wright
looked
aggrieved
not
at
all
he
contradicted
only
the
fashions
for
men
are
utterly
devoid
of
beauty
i
wish
i
had
lived
some
time
back
in
the
satin
and
lace
cuff
period
but
you
objected
bill
insultingly
i
am
not
said
wright
indignantly
observe
he
thrust
out
a
far
from
unshapely
calf
in
tweed
knickers
if
my
extremities
show
a
slight
tendency
to
bow
it
is
merely
a
sign
of
physical
strength
and
many
years
spent
in
the
saddle
and
on
the
diamond
said
mercedes
to
me
in
an
aside
now
you
know
my
mother
would
never
have
listened
to
such
a
discussion
in
madrid
she
would
never
have
had
the
opportunity
i
whispered
back
to
return
to
the
mendez
ball
said
wright
raising
his
voice
with
intent
i
thought
a
simple
flower
in
my
hair
or
thrust
into
my
waistcoat
you
an
ass
remarked
bill
yawning
perhaps
conceded
wright
pleasantly
but
it
is
a
quality
which
keeps
me
much
in
demand
you
will
never
said
bill
deliberately
get
very
far
in
your
work
old
man
for
one
thing
you
have
too
much
money
for
another
you
take
nothing
seriously
how
about
yourself
asked
wright
a
little
stirred
bill
glanced
at
mercedes
but
she
smiled
at
him
and
nodded
i
have
found
out
about
you
billy
she
said
so
go
ahead
and
talk
who
told
you
demanded
my
husband
not
very
angrily
partly
wright
i
wormed
it
out
of
him
after
he
had
let
something
slip
and
more
recently
mavis
mavis
said
bill
in
astonishment
i
did
not
meet
his
eyes
why
not
asked
mercedes
she
is
bursting
with
pride
in
you
naturally
va
sans
dire
so
after
i
had
probed
and
begged
a
little
she
let
me
see
the
book
it
is
very
wonderful
she
ended
with
that
utter
lack
of
in
expressing
her
emotions
and
opinions
which
after
one
was
used
to
it
was
rather
endearing
well
then
as
you
among
friends
billy
i
repeat
what
about
yourself
i
have
my
profession
bill
answered
quietly
i
am
a
doctor
and
i
love
it
it
is
perhaps
my
vocation
to
heal
and
to
mend
and
to
help
and
equally
perhaps
poetry
is
my
avocation
dictionary
definition
of
avocation
is
said
wright
triumphantly
and
the
definition
of
diversion
is
i
put
in
exactly
said
bill
to
create
anew
to
refresh
that
is
perhaps
the
mission
of
poetry
and
applies
to
the
poet
as
well
as
to
his
audience
poetry
is
for
me
the
language
of
dreams
the
ceaseless
search
for
beauty
something
common
to
all
men
for
the
peasant
dreams
as
well
as
the
inventor
the
man
of
science
as
well
as
the
financier
and
the
college
professor
who
thinks
of
education
as
something
bigger
than
is
contained
between
the
covers
of
a
and
from
the
soil
the
shop
the
laboratory
the
office
and
the
great
songs
have
been
sung
not
all
of
them
in
words
the
financier
dreams
said
wright
incredulously
not
much
if
he
did
he
would
be
where
he
is
answered
bill
if
the
engineer
did
dream
the
bridges
would
not
be
swung
over
the
boiling
rivers
of
strange
countries
or
the
railroad
tracks
laid
through
the
virgin
jungle
and
the
ageless
desert
i
had
a
curious
sensation
listening
to
that
even
low
voice
it
was
as
if
for
the
first
time
i
had
heard
richard
warren
speak
i
guess
you
right
said
the
other
man
after
a
moment
of
silence
of
course
i
am
answered
bill
and
so
the
poets
dream
dreams
too
and
try
to
interpret
other
men
dreams
those
which
are
built
in
brick
and
stone
materialized
into
steel
founded
in
a
huge
office
building
the
grim
reality
of
war
stands
for
dreams
sometimes
many
inarticulate
poets
have
gone
singing
to
the
bayonet
thrust
once
a
handful
of
people
dreamed
of
liberty
and
the
united
states
was
their
expression
of
that
dream
someone
drew
a
deep
breath
it
was
i
perhaps
bill
looked
over
at
me
shaking
the
ash
from
his
cigarette
and
for
a
moment
i
forgot
the
feud
between
us
forgot
that
we
were
very
soon
to
go
our
separate
ways
forgot
a
number
of
things
that
i
had
known
and
i
remembered
only
the
songs
that
richard
warren
had
sung
for
the
world
it
was
a
dream
too
said
mercedes
which
made
cuba
free
we
were
grave
as
together
we
four
had
never
been
through
the
sunny
idle
days
i
had
the
oddest
feeling
that
between
us
all
lay
something
unspoken
unnamed
intangible
as
if
too
for
the
moment
we
were
closely
knit
together
completely
well
said
wright
easily
swinging
the
conversation
back
to
its
starting
place
it
all
very
well
to
talk
and
perhaps
you
are
more
serious
than
i
bill
mind
i
do
altogether
admit
it
but
you
tune
your
lyre
to
a
deeper
key
than
i
do
mine
i
ca
claim
to
be
a
poet
a
versifier
yes
you
do
yourself
an
injustice
i
said
warmly
for
wright
somewhat
exotic
had
long
since
come
into
my
knowledge
and
i
had
seen
some
of
his
magazine
verse
you
a
gift
said
my
husband
not
lightly
to
be
disregarded
but
you
too
versatile
you
paint
better
than
you
write
and
there
a
lot
in
the
old
parable
of
the
talents
and
by
george
you
no
honest
right
to
your
talent
if
in
some
way
you
do
not
use
it
for
the
good
of
your
that
what
i
tell
him
broke
in
mercedes
in
a
little
earnest
note
and
blushed
a
rosy
red
the
links
were
almost
deserted
and
the
long
past
realizing
that
it
would
be
late
before
we
reached
home
i
rose
reluctantly
for
there
had
been
a
spirit
around
the
table
which
could
not
easily
be
recaptured
and
i
regretted
its
passing
the
tourists
have
practically
all
left
said
mercedes
on
the
way
to
the
car
very
few
are
here
still
and
the
residents
have
already
begun
to
go
north
you
practise
again
this
year
asked
wright
of
bill
as
the
car
drove
off
and
i
heard
my
husband
answer
that
depends
very
much
on
mavis
is
he
to
poetize
or
administer
pills
asked
wright
turning
to
me
both
i
hope
i
answered
casually
good
doctors
may
not
be
as
rare
as
good
poets
but
the
combination
is
remarkable
i
should
think
said
mercedes
with
candour
that
you
would
be
awfully
jealous
grateful
lady
patients
asked
wright
she
nodded
i
not
had
the
opportunity
yet
i
answered
since
i
known
him
bill
has
had
many
patients
except
me
quite
a
serious
case
remarked
wright
solemnly
one
that
demands
incessant
medical
attention
bill
laughed
if
mavis
can
stand
for
irregular
hours
and
cold
meals
he
said
i
start
in
again
when
our
vacation
is
over
you
need
rub
it
into
me
that
i
do
have
to
work
for
a
living
said
wright
look
at
you
taking
a
year
off
decent
for
a
doctor
i
ca
help
it
that
my
late
lamented
uncle
made
successfully
and
that
i
was
his
only
living
relative
he
did
approve
of
me
at
all
he
concluded
modestly
and
he
thought
my
verses
immoral
but
he
could
leave
it
all
to
charity
you
know
i
never
lacked
having
more
money
than
i
needed
said
bill
as
we
drove
through
the
hot
quiet
night
but
i
been
glad
of
it
if
it
did
provide
me
with
an
added
incentive
to
work
it
at
least
allowed
me
to
do
a
good
deal
that
i
otherwise
could
not
have
done
the
denton
free
clinic
for
instance
said
wright
but
bill
did
not
answer
for
just
a
second
i
was
hurt
that
he
had
told
me
and
then
i
remembered
how
little
i
knew
about
the
man
who
was
my
husband
mercedes
in
the
front
seat
with
bill
asked
him
a
question
under
the
cover
of
their
voices
wright
said
to
me
i
should
chaff
bill
like
that
i
do
suppose
that
there
is
another
medico
of
his
age
in
new
york
who
has
done
so
much
there
are
districts
where
the
people
have
absolutely
canonized
him
he
never
tells
me
about
that
side
of
it
i
said
i
do
suppose
he
would
answered
wright
you
get
to
know
these
things
by
chance
but
he
had
a
streak
in
him
even
at
princeton
that
made
him
different
from
the
rest
of
us
and
men
who
were
with
him
at
johns
hopkins
could
tell
you
tales
bridge
tonight
said
mercedes
i
jumped
my
thoughts
had
been
very
far
away
filling
in
gaps
you
have
to
play
with
me
said
wright
i
understand
all
your
signals
mercedes
but
you
do
profit
by
them
she
answered
as
we
came
within
sight
of
the
house
i
played
a
wretched
game
that
evening
i
could
keep
my
mind
on
the
cards
it
was
off
back
at
the
country
club
again
listening
to
a
poet
talk
of
poets
it
was
wondering
a
little
about
the
denton
free
clinic
and
in
consequence
i
revoked
twice
to
the
extreme
amusement
of
our
opponents
have
come
to
the
point
where
you
swear
at
your
wife
at
the
have
you
bill
asked
wright
as
he
carefully
took
the
penalty
no
replied
my
husband
that
a
form
of
indoor
sport
i
could
never
quite
understand
it
does
seem
fair
for
she
could
swear
back
oh
could
i
said
i
with
ardour
i
sha
give
you
the
opportunity
he
answered
and
now
if
you
please
one
no
trump
the
game
broke
up
rather
early
i
was
tired
and
wanted
to
go
to
bed
wright
and
mercedes
with
the
excuse
that
they
were
keenly
interested
in
astronomy
walked
out
on
the
verandah
i
told
them
you
stay
to
chaperone
the
irresponsibles
i
asked
my
husband
gladly
he
said
and
discreetly
from
a
distance
there
was
something
so
comfortable
and
lovable
about
him
that
night
that
i
suddenly
wanted
to
tell
him
i
was
sorry
that
we
had
quarrelled
sorry
that
the
barrier
had
arisen
between
us
but
i
could
in
one
way
however
i
might
make
amends
i
said
i
grown
awfully
fond
of
mercedes
i
hope
she
will
come
north
sometime
for
the
summer
perhaps
i
think
i
misjudged
her
cruelly
for
a
while
the
eyes
grew
warm
she
a
very
nice
child
said
bill
and
i
knew
you
find
it
out
before
long
you
did
give
her
a
chance
at
first
but
i
glad
you
like
her
mavis
for
you
can
do
her
a
lot
of
good
how
i
asked
curiously
well
for
one
thing
you
pretty
well
balanced
most
of
the
time
and
for
another
you
have
had
the
advantage
of
a
unique
and
splendid
upbringing
and
for
another
you
are
unless
given
certain
circumstances
most
uncommonly
sweet
he
said
it
in
a
very
tone
and
looked
at
his
watch
as
he
spoke
not
at
me
i
was
absurdly
embarrassed
are
are
you
a
circumstance
i
asked
daringly
and
escaped
to
my
room
before
he
could
answer
i
heard
him
start
to
follow
me
but
apparently
he
thought
better
of
it
but
long
after
i
was
in
bed
i
heard
a
under
my
windows
the
smell
of
a
pipe
drifted
in
through
the
and
the
sound
of
a
baritone
voice
singing
softly
who
is
sylvia
who
is
she
is
she
kind
as
she
is
fair
i
lay
for
some
time
listening
and
finally
as
the
footsteps
turned
away
and
the
song
grew
fainter
i
laid
my
hot
cheek
to
the
pillow
and
slept
dreamlessly
until
morning
but
when
morning
came
it
all
seemed
very
far
away
that
talk
at
the
country
club
and
the
steps
below
my
window
wright
was
in
his
silliest
mood
and
mercedes
and
he
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
foolishness
bill
was
preoccupied
almost
abrupt
he
left
us
directly
after
lunch
on
one
of
his
now
daily
visits
to
the
crowell
plantation
and
mercedes
disappeared
with
wright
at
the
same
time
where
they
were
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
i
had
tea
alone
peter
was
with
sarah
and
after
tea
i
went
out
restlessly
and
walked
stopping
at
old
manuel
and
at
annunciata
it
was
growing
dark
before
i
turned
homewards
again
and
there
was
a
strange
lingering
light
in
the
sky
which
drew
my
attention
a
great
cloud
murky
and
ominous
not
like
any
cloud
i
had
ever
seen
i
hurried
on
and
had
reached
the
gates
before
the
wind
came
a
rush
a
tearing
at
trees
and
bushes
a
tremendous
sweep
of
hot
choking
dust
and
air
i
could
hardly
keep
my
feet
and
struggled
step
by
step
head
down
almost
defenceless
in
the
face
of
the
storm
the
wind
had
risen
apparently
without
warning
and
yet
looking
back
on
it
afterwards
i
realized
that
had
i
been
a
little
more
familiar
with
the
vagaries
of
cuban
climate
i
would
have
noticed
the
curious
hush
the
absolute
stillness
expectant
and
breathless
which
lay
over
guayabal
just
before
the
storm
broke
nearing
the
house
i
heard
a
tremendous
crash
voices
and
the
sound
of
hurrying
the
wind
was
increasing
in
volume
and
i
fairly
stumbled
up
the
steps
almost
falling
when
my
hand
was
finally
on
the
door
it
was
wrenched
open
with
violence
and
i
saw
bill
on
the
threshold
very
white
with
burning
blue
eyes
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
pulled
me
into
the
room
where
have
you
been
he
said
furiously
walking
said
i
the
ruins
of
my
hat
in
my
hand
he
made
a
sound
in
his
throat
the
roof
of
the
garage
has
blown
off
he
said
it
a
nice
little
storm
i
have
been
looking
for
you
all
over
the
plantation
no
one
had
any
idea
where
you
were
i
found
wright
and
sent
mercedes
in
the
house
she
had
rather
a
narrow
escape
from
a
falling
tree
all
right
but
hysterical
i
must
go
to
her
at
once
i
said
starting
off
the
long
arm
shot
out
and
i
was
pulled
close
to
the
tall
lean
figure
just
a
minute
said
bill
mercedes
is
all
right
as
i
said
sarah
is
with
her
but
i
want
to
ask
you
this
quite
aside
from
the
danger
you
ran
in
a
wind
like
this
why
did
you
disobey
my
express
wishes
and
go
out
alone
away
from
the
house
then
i
remembered
i
said
i
and
was
silent
bill
dropped
my
arm
i
suppose
he
said
with
bitterness
it
was
because
i
asked
you
not
to
very
well
i
learned
my
lesson
you
knew
that
guayabal
is
in
a
very
unsettled
state
you
knew
that
crowell
had
had
trouble
on
his
plantation
i
told
you
there
had
been
threats
demonstrations
i
asked
you
not
to
run
any
risks
that
is
why
i
suppose
when
the
opportunity
arose
you
deliberately
ignored
my
wishes
you
are
very
unjust
i
said
fighting
back
the
tears
i
hope
so
said
bill
quietly
but
i
afraid
not
it
seems
as
if
we
could
have
a
whole
day
of
peace
and
friendliness
under
the
same
roof
i
tried
my
best
mavis
to
be
as
little
in
your
way
as
possible
to
make
the
best
of
a
trying
situation
but
at
every
turn
you
manage
to
antagonize
me
and
to
rebel
against
me
i
might
have
known
he
turned
away
and
lighted
a
cigarette
with
fingers
which
shook
i
sorry
i
said
steadying
my
voice
with
an
effort
if
i
have
annoyed
you
i
did
not
go
out
this
afternoon
with
such
intention
i
would
have
stopped
there
but
the
lift
of
his
shoulders
angered
me
until
i
finally
lost
all
control
of
myself
i
not
be
a
burden
to
you
long
i
said
as
soon
as
we
are
home
again
i
will
release
you
from
your
responsibilities
i
have
wanted
to
spare
father
but
i
see
that
i
ca
you
go
too
far
i
do
know
how
such
things
are
done
but
it
should
be
very
difficult
to
obtain
an
annulment
of
our
marriage
the
whole
thing
has
been
a
ghastly
mistake
an
impulse
i
have
regretted
ever
since
but
it
not
too
late
i
said
with
my
head
held
very
high
to
rectify
that
mistake
i
walked
past
him
into
my
own
room
somehow
the
pride
that
had
always
come
to
my
rescue
was
missing
now
i
was
just
hurt
hurt
and
unhappy
and
very
lonely
to
speak
to
me
so
to
look
at
me
so
out
of
those
eyes
it
was
not
just
it
was
not
anything
but
deliberate
cruelty
once
having
said
that
i
would
make
myself
free
the
thing
crystalized
for
me
as
it
had
never
done
before
of
course
i
had
meant
all
along
to
separate
from
my
temporary
husband
that
was
understood
at
the
outset
but
it
had
seemed
a
long
way
off
indefinitely
vague
and
now
that
my
decision
was
spoken
it
loomed
very
near
irrevocable
i
shrank
in
anticipation
from
the
publicity
of
it
the
questions
the
prying
eyes
wright
would
wonder
and
grieve
and
mercedes
and
i
i
hardly
knew
on
father
sorrow
and
i
dared
not
dwell
now
i
had
nothing
left
i
rose
and
bathed
my
eyes
they
were
swollen
from
crying
and
my
throat
ached
abominably
and
then
with
a
tremendous
effort
i
opened
my
door
and
went
out
to
find
mercedes
she
was
in
her
room
shaken
but
quite
recovered
and
full
of
gratitude
to
wright
for
seeing
her
danger
and
pulling
her
away
just
in
time
where
were
you
she
asked
anxiously
you
were
hurt
were
you
you
look
dreadfully
mavis
hurt
yes
i
was
hurt
beyond
healing
but
mercedes
must
not
know
i
was
in
no
danger
i
said
evasively
i
came
in
just
as
the
storm
was
beginning
you
heard
the
roof
go
then
she
asked
was
it
awful
it
is
a
wonder
bill
was
killed
he
was
just
driving
the
car
in
bill
i
said
stupidly
what
the
matter
did
he
tell
you
you
white
as
a
sheet
she
jumped
up
from
the
bed
and
put
her
arms
about
me
mavis
are
you
faint
let
me
call
bill
please
do
i
said
i
all
right
now
the
dreadful
dizziness
had
passed
my
ears
stopped
singing
and
the
room
assumed
its
normal
aspect
again
if
you
do
mind
i
said
i
lie
down
beside
you
for
a
bit
please
do
tell
anyone
i
nervous
i
suppose
and
upset
and
so
it
was
in
mercedes
howells
arms
that
i
finally
cried
myself
into
calmness
and
mercedes
suddenly
tender
and
very
gentle
never
asked
why
and
bless
her
heart
never
told
chapter
xviii
a
day
or
so
went
by
devoid
of
any
particular
incident
if
bill
and
i
spoke
to
each
other
at
all
it
was
to
discuss
our
plans
for
leaving
cuba
the
goodriches
were
returning
shortly
from
europe
father
sent
a
cable
from
green
hill
the
weather
was
beginning
to
grow
very
warm
in
short
a
hundred
and
one
things
warned
us
that
the
spring
were
better
spent
in
the
north
we
fixed
our
departure
for
a
day
not
two
weeks
distant
and
bill
went
into
havana
to
book
our
passage
even
in
public
we
had
dropped
the
pretence
of
marital
banter
but
wright
and
mercedes
apparently
absorbed
in
each
other
did
not
notice
or
if
they
did
kept
each
his
and
her
own
counsel
as
far
as
i
knew
the
lazy
days
seemed
interminable
i
had
luckily
a
number
of
things
to
arrange
another
trunk
to
buy
and
some
sewing
to
accomplish
with
annunciata
help
and
bill
obvious
preoccupation
could
easily
have
been
laid
to
the
growing
unrest
in
guayabal
crowell
an
anxious
nervous
but
charming
person
had
been
more
than
once
at
the
palms
to
discuss
the
situation
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
husband
sense
of
responsibility
towards
the
reynolds
i
think
that
we
should
have
packed
up
and
left
cuba
in
short
order
but
he
was
anxious
to
stay
on
for
a
time
longer
and
see
silas
and
what
men
were
loyal
to
their
american
employer
through
what
he
hoped
would
prove
a
passing
phase
of
revolt
or
so
he
said
as
for
me
i
went
through
the
days
weighted
under
a
burden
of
uncertainty
and
a
sorrow
without
name
father
miniature
lying
open
on
my
seemed
to
reproach
me
seemed
too
at
times
to
reproach
himself
which
was
even
harder
to
bear
i
have
done
my
human
best
for
you
the
mouth
seemed
to
say
i
have
never
wanted
anything
but
your
happiness
my
little
mavis
and
the
kind
humorous
eyes
added
is
it
my
fault
that
i
must
hear
you
sobbing
through
these
long
unhappy
nights
no
not
his
fault
whose
then
i
dared
not
ask
the
picture
in
the
little
leather
case
for
i
was
afraid
it
might
answer
it
is
fault
father
i
would
defend
myself
mutely
we
might
have
been
content
even
happy
in
a
friendly
way
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
it
was
not
for
friendship
alone
that
i
gave
you
to
him
daughter
the
answer
would
come
but
for
something
dearer
bigger
deeper
you
were
so
young
and
so
alien
from
the
world
i
had
thought
that
the
man
to
whom
we
both
owe
everything
would
be
the
one
to
help
you
through
all
that
first
difficult
time
to
teach
you
finally
life
loveliest
lesson
and
i
had
hoped
prayed
even
that
you
would
one
day
come
to
be
to
him
what
your
mother
was
to
me
there
was
not
much
time
the
beloved
voice
went
on
very
sadly
for
me
to
make
a
decision
it
was
hard
to
feel
i
might
have
to
leave
you
alone
unsheltered
how
hard
you
will
never
know
unless
some
day
you
are
called
upon
to
leave
a
child
of
your
own
father
i
begged
please
if
the
mistake
was
mine
said
the
voice
which
still
seemed
to
come
from
that
unsmiling
miniature
i
can
only
ask
your
forgiveness
mavis
even
your
father
who
loves
you
beyond
all
earthly
things
was
wrong
to
try
and
shape
your
destiny
no
no
i
sobbed
i
laid
the
minature
on
the
table
again
the
voice
in
my
heart
had
ceased
to
speak
there
were
only
the
pictured
eyes
looking
into
mine
from
a
little
leather
case
but
for
a
long
time
father
had
talked
to
me
so
i
read
between
the
lines
of
his
letters
and
prayed
that
he
should
not
read
between
the
lying
phrases
of
mine
was
it
all
lies
i
am
happy
i
told
him
again
and
again
and
he
who
knew
me
so
well
was
convinced
perhaps
because
in
a
certain
curious
sense
that
much
was
true
underneath
bewilderment
misunderstanding
the
pinpricks
of
pride
and
the
smart
of
old
resentments
i
been
happy
it
was
as
if
i
walked
on
a
strange
new
road
toward
some
unknown
goal
some
unguessed
shelter
there
were
turnings
in
the
path
dark
places
uneven
stretches
but
always
a
bird
sang
sweetly
in
the
distance
the
sun
cleared
the
clouds
and
adventure
waited
for
me
just
around
the
corner
but
lately
the
ground
had
fallen
away
from
under
my
very
feet
and
left
me
standing
at
the
edge
of
an
abyss
looking
across
a
chasm
of
despair
to
the
far
country
i
would
never
reach
mercedes
knocked
at
my
door
and
came
in
you
been
away
so
long
she
said
reproachfully
wright
is
going
to
mass
with
me
in
the
church
at
ceube
wo
you
come
too
mavis
it
sunday
then
i
thought
wondering
how
the
days
had
passed
nameless
and
unheeded
by
me
every
one
bringing
me
nearer
sure
you
want
me
i
asked
and
at
her
assurance
i
got
my
hat
and
set
out
with
her
and
wright
in
the
car
bill
drove
us
down
he
did
come
in
but
went
about
other
business
after
he
had
left
us
at
the
little
church
solidly
built
of
time
and
weather
stained
adobe
and
squatly
towered
the
small
room
was
filled
with
people
we
squeezed
into
an
already
overcrowded
pew
and
kneeling
i
was
almost
drugged
with
the
clouds
of
incense
and
the
hot
close
air
at
the
altar
the
priest
very
old
and
frail
intoned
the
ceremonial
service
a
boy
black
as
his
robes
and
slippered
swung
the
heavy
censer
and
looked
over
the
audience
for
possible
disturbances
they
occurred
more
than
once
the
brown
babies
cooed
or
cried
according
to
their
several
temperaments
a
mongrel
dog
ran
in
and
out
of
the
pews
at
a
heels
and
here
and
there
a
girl
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
some
responsive
cavalier
who
stood
or
knelt
with
the
many
worshippers
lining
the
walls
there
was
an
amazing
almost
tangible
spirit
in
the
place
a
mingling
of
childlike
devotion
and
equally
childlike
theatricalism
the
people
came
to
the
service
like
children
to
a
parent
wholly
natural
wholly
simple
and
yet
not
wholly
devoid
of
a
certain
dramatic
instinct
and
above
all
keenly
sensitive
to
the
vapor
the
lace
and
vestments
of
the
priest
the
solemn
intonation
of
the
mass
birds
flew
astonishingly
in
and
out
of
the
windows
the
consumptive
organ
wheezed
and
muttered
the
voices
of
the
people
rose
with
a
grave
eagerness
upon
the
heavy
air
and
here
and
there
an
adventurous
ray
of
sunshine
fell
alike
on
old
and
young
heads
lingered
on
the
gay
colors
of
the
dresses
slid
like
a
finger
of
gold
over
the
priest
at
the
little
altar
and
danced
across
the
heavy
smoky
rafters
of
the
ceiling
mercedes
her
lovely
face
hidden
told
her
silver
and
pearl
rosary
wright
after
his
first
moment
of
embarrassment
and
instinctive
recoil
from
so
much
massed
humanity
was
engrossed
in
her
in
his
surroundings
i
imagined
i
saw
a
picture
shaping
a
little
more
tender
a
little
more
serious
than
anything
he
had
done
yet
and
i
kneeling
in
the
stuffy
chapel
with
an
alien
people
of
a
different
expression
of
faith
felt
for
the
first
time
in
many
many
hours
a
sense
of
release
of
peace
a
cooling
touch
on
my
hot
and
aching
heart
mass
over
the
people
poured
laughing
talking
gesticulating
out
into
the
thick
yellow
sunshine
the
which
had
deflected
the
thoughts
of
some
of
the
younger
worshippers
were
renewed
and
pursued
a
young
mother
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
church
and
bared
her
brown
breast
to
her
baby
fumbling
lips
she
looked
a
madonna
as
she
sat
there
unconscious
of
the
people
around
her
a
white
mantilla
framing
her
face
her
husband
a
man
taller
than
the
average
cuban
stood
behind
her
smoking
his
coarse
white
trousers
dazzling
in
the
sunshine
his
bright
purple
american
shirt
worn
like
a
smock
after
the
dress
regulations
of
guayabal
on
sunday
bill
drove
up
presently
and
as
usual
the
straggling
children
clustered
around
the
car
he
was
always
dear
with
children
white
or
black
brown
or
yellow
they
were
instantly
his
friends
wiggles
riding
proudly
in
the
front
seat
created
quite
a
sensation
and
mercedes
climbing
in
to
hold
him
in
her
pretty
lap
had
great
difficulty
in
restraining
him
where
is
his
collar
mavis
she
asked
clutching
the
frantic
dog
to
her
demure
white
frills
he
was
uncomfortable
with
it
in
the
heat
i
answered
were
you
wigglesworth
so
i
took
it
off
the
car
gave
a
sudden
leap
and
i
knew
that
bill
had
been
listening
for
my
answer
knew
that
he
knew
that
i
could
not
throw
innocent
wiggles
away
but
that
when
the
mask
had
fallen
from
richard
warren
i
had
in
a
fit
of
anger
taken
away
the
collar
it
was
in
my
trunk
but
sometimes
i
wondered
what
had
happened
to
my
lucky
charm
of
cool
green
jade
flung
from
my
window
in
a
moment
of
pure
rage
once
i
had
looked
for
it
the
day
after
mercedes
and
i
had
in
the
not
since
when
we
had
arrived
home
wright
drew
me
mysteriously
aside
let
me
see
those
last
two
poems
of
yours
again
will
you
mavis
he
said
one
of
the
men
i
was
at
college
with
wants
me
to
go
in
with
him
on
a
and
publishing
venture
you
know
odd
books
quaintly
bound
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
has
his
eye
on
a
place
in
greenwich
village
and
just
the
right
but
delusively
shrewd
girl
to
run
it
the
shop
end
i
mean
what
do
you
want
the
verses
for
i
asked
suspiciously
wright
grinned
if
i
am
to
be
the
angel
in
this
affair
he
said
how
could
i
employ
celestial
qualities
better
than
to
boost
my
friends
and
incidentally
myself
we
can
collect
your
poems
publish
them
in
a
sufficiently
bizarre
edition
to
attract
attention
and
without
letting
john
denton
solid
and
conservative
firm
into
the
secret
you
can
astonish
your
husband
by
christmas
say
with
a
book
of
your
own
but
i
argued
they
not
good
enough
they
good
enough
for
me
said
wright
magnificently
and
it
will
be
rather
fun
having
a
business
of
this
sort
to
play
with
it
one
way
of
revenging
myself
on
those
beastly
i
grew
just
a
little
excited
picturing
bill
astonishment
and
i
would
not
be
there
to
hear
his
criticism
i
had
a
dozen
verses
or
more
which
wright
had
not
yet
seen
the
best
i
thought
of
all
and
of
the
poems
i
had
styled
cuban
pastels
the
two
he
had
just
spoken
of
headed
the
group
havana
harbor
hued
as
a
peacock
plumage
wide
unfurled
the
sea
dreams
smiling
far
off
toylike
frail
a
boat
drifts
to
the
blue
edge
of
the
world
the
brilliant
sunlight
glinting
from
it
sail
an
idle
cruiser
sinister
and
grey
drifts
out
of
tune
with
sunlight
and
with
dreams
while
on
the
the
scatters
to
crystal
shot
with
opal
gleams
the
shore
curves
tender
as
a
clasping
arm
like
cardboard
structures
from
a
clever
hand
bright
in
the
sun
and
touched
with
charm
unreal
the
ragged
lines
of
houses
stand
dim
with
the
past
a
fortress
yet
a
city
whose
feet
are
free
to
wear
serene
as
some
coquette
the
anklet
of
the
sea
morro
castle
an
old
fortress
wrapped
in
magic
sleep
the
city
crouching
watchdog
fronts
the
sea
and
locks
stone
lips
on
tales
of
on
legends
of
dead
terrors
buried
deep
and
gives
no
hint
of
strangled
plea
choked
to
swift
silence
in
the
torture
cell
in
ages
dark
with
bloody
sweat
of
pain
ah
if
the
morro
ghosts
could
walk
again
what
whispered
horror
could
those
bruised
throats
tell
wrung
by
the
cruel
long
hands
of
ancient
spain
i
gave
the
verses
to
wright
after
luncheon
all
of
them
he
could
do
with
them
as
he
liked
i
said
revise
correct
i
was
tired
of
singing
songs
but
i
did
not
tell
him
that
in
my
heart
i
thought
i
would
be
glad
to
have
my
verses
bound
and
shut
in
a
little
book
they
would
remind
me
of
cuba
and
of
other
things
when
i
was
too
old
too
armoured
by
time
to
feel
the
hurt
of
remembering
i
would
keep
my
diary
too
against
that
distant
day
time
i
had
read
heals
all
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
sometime
the
ache
in
my
breast
would
be
stilled
but
i
thought
perhaps
i
would
miss
it
it
would
grow
to
be
part
of
me
after
a
while
mercedes
looking
in
on
me
from
the
flowers
screening
the
verandah
where
i
sat
asked
coaxingly
coming
walking
with
us
mavis
us
i
inquired
wright
and
billy
and
me
i
shook
my
hand
i
think
not
i
answered
i
have
some
letters
to
write
billy
said
you
would
come
said
she
pouting
did
he
for
a
moment
i
was
inclined
to
reconsider
but
the
delight
of
proving
my
husband
wrong
would
not
have
atoned
for
an
hour
of
his
society
and
well
i
knew
that
wright
and
mercedes
would
eventually
wander
off
or
get
surprisingly
lost
or
accomplish
one
of
the
fifty
odd
things
which
they
managed
so
ingenuously
and
which
would
rid
them
of
even
the
most
friendly
chaperonage
mercedes
waited
bill
is
right
i
said
as
always
i
think
i
not
go
mercedes
if
you
and
wright
do
mind
not
at
all
she
said
generously
only
and
here
her
voice
grew
wistful
only
the
time
is
getting
so
short
mavis
in
two
days
be
going
to
havana
for
the
mendez
dance
and
to
stay
and
then
before
we
know
it
you
will
be
going
home
again
but
you
following
shortly
i
reminded
her
with
my
family
she
added
wo
your
mother
consider
lending
you
to
me
for
a
while
this
summer
i
asked
i
shall
be
and
almost
i
had
said
so
very
lonely
before
i
thought
i
stopped
shall
be
what
asked
mercedes
coming
up
the
steps
and
dropping
to
my
feet
on
a
crimson
cushion
so
very
glad
to
see
you
i
answered
and
truly
i
wonder
said
mercedes
that
not
very
nice
of
you
i
accused
her
i
did
mean
what
you
said
she
hastened
to
explain
i
only
meant
i
wonder
if
wright
would
wait
over
and
go
up
with
us
it
is
so
dull
she
went
on
just
travelling
with
the
family
and
father
likes
him
so
much
what
do
you
think
mavis
mavis
thought
that
without
wright
pleasant
obtuse
presence
that
homeward
voyage
would
be
a
nightmare
but
she
did
not
say
so
i
sure
he
love
to
i
answered
smiling
into
the
pretty
eager
face
especially
if
you
ask
him
very
nicely
mercedes
laid
her
flushed
cheek
for
a
minute
against
my
knees
through
the
thin
fabric
of
my
gown
i
could
feel
the
warmth
of
it
you
like
wright
do
you
she
asked
a
little
anxiously
and
billy
best
friend
i
put
my
hand
on
her
smooth
heavy
hair
a
scent
as
of
youth
and
flowers
and
sunshine
came
to
me
from
the
polished
coils
of
it
wright
was
a
very
fortunate
young
person
i
very
fond
of
him
silly
said
i
and
bill
adores
him
there
is
that
recommendation
enough
she
jumped
up
in
a
whirl
of
skirts
and
kissed
me
impetuously
held
me
a
moment
in
the
clasp
of
her
strong
young
arms
and
then
her
high
heels
clicking
on
the
tiles
ran
into
the
house
more
than
enough
she
called
over
her
shoulder
but
when
charmingly
hatted
dragging
the
point
of
a
butterfly
sunshade
after
her
she
went
down
the
path
between
bill
and
wright
there
was
no
sign
of
her
recent
agitation
on
that
smooth
creamy
cheek
left
alone
i
sighed
a
little
and
looked
ahead
they
had
fallen
in
love
so
wholeheartedly
so
gaily
those
two
i
pictured
them
if
all
went
well
going
through
life
like
the
princess
and
prince
in
the
living
happily
forever
after
she
could
love
i
knew
that
little
friend
of
mine
she
was
young
too
younger
than
her
years
an
astonishing
thing
in
southern
women
she
would
be
easily
assimilated
would
adapt
herself
gracefully
and
it
was
patent
that
she
thought
wright
head
and
shoulders
above
the
average
cut
of
men
she
had
told
me
so
without
knowing
it
over
and
over
again
and
wright
diffident
sensitive
wright
under
his
absurdities
and
his
worldly
airs
he
would
cherish
her
i
knew
and
be
good
to
her
all
his
life
invest
her
with
a
glamour
make
her
his
model
and
his
sovereign
lady
write
madrigals
about
her
worship
at
her
tiny
feet
it
was
a
very
pretty
little
romance
they
would
never
have
pain
in
their
love
i
thought
never
know
undreamed
of
depths
of
agony
and
never
know
secret
shrines
despoiled
the
altars
overthrown
desecrated
i
heard
peter
voice
in
the
living
room
and
sarah
asking
where
i
was
i
called
to
them
and
went
in
it
was
strange
i
thought
as
i
discussed
with
sarah
the
preliminaries
of
packing
how
much
i
seemed
to
know
about
love
i
who
had
never
known
nor
felt
any
save
my
father
and
that
of
my
few
placid
friends
and
perhaps
that
love
that
is
all
and
in
my
heart
was
a
voice
which
questioned
and
which
i
dared
not
answer
how
do
you
it
said
to
me
do
you
know
i
closed
my
ears
to
it
and
drew
peter
into
my
lap
will
you
be
glad
to
go
home
i
asked
him
well
said
peter
considering
there
silas
so
there
is
i
assented
could
he
come
with
us
asked
peter
coaxingly
he
could
sleep
in
my
room
i
looked
at
sarah
for
appreciation
of
this
lean
long
silas
lodging
in
peter
small
nest
and
i
looked
twice
sarah
her
head
bent
over
an
armful
of
my
gowns
was
i
could
believe
my
eyes
i
might
have
fancied
the
rock
of
gibraltar
moved
to
such
soft
symptoms
of
complexion
before
sarah
why
sarah
i
said
in
amazement
the
difficult
red
crept
up
to
her
honest
eyes
she
raised
them
and
met
mine
and
what
i
saw
there
was
very
beautiful
i
put
peter
off
my
lap
run
out
and
play
for
a
while
dear
i
said
before
tea
and
then
sarah
he
a
good
man
miss
mavis
she
answered
clutching
the
gowns
to
her
ruinously
my
careful
sarah
and
we
neither
of
us
so
young
nor
so
flighty
that
we
would
know
our
own
minds
reynolds
has
written
him
that
he
has
a
buyer
for
the
place
and
we
thought
that
when
things
was
settled
down
here
silas
could
come
up
north
to
green
hill
and
but
sarah
i
cried
out
in
childish
dismay
i
ca
lose
you
i
ca
she
put
the
gowns
on
a
nearby
chair
and
touched
my
hair
with
her
faithful
old
hand
indeed
miss
mavis
she
said
earnestly
not
for
a
hundred
silases
would
i
leave
you
but
silas
spoke
to
the
doctor
about
a
place
and
the
doctor
said
he
needed
a
man
to
drive
for
him
and
so
if
you
want
us
we
could
both
stay
on
no
one
could
take
care
of
you
she
said
jealously
except
me
does
the
doctor
know
about
you
i
asked
silas
did
tell
him
and
i
was
going
to
wait
until
we
got
home
it
come
all
at
once
she
explained
but
silas
thinks
maybe
guessed
and
i
had
been
so
blind
so
blind
to
the
times
when
sarah
walked
out
with
silas
for
a
breath
of
air
so
blind
to
the
long
silences
in
the
kitchen
of
an
evening
under
norah
cordial
irish
eyes
it
wonderful
i
said
at
last
silas
is
a
lucky
man
i
awfully
happy
for
you
sarah
you
ai
angry
she
asked
timidly
you
do
think
foolishness
at
my
age
i
think
it
beautiful
i
said
and
as
she
turned
to
go
i
put
out
a
hand
to
draw
her
near
to
kiss
her
the
only
mother
i
had
ever
known
faithful
tender
i
was
glad
that
her
old
age
would
be
sheltered
and
made
happy
for
her
after
she
had
gone
i
sat
for
a
long
time
in
silence
the
voices
of
the
others
their
steps
on
the
path
aroused
me
and
as
i
went
out
obediently
to
wright
hail
i
thought
of
mercedes
and
now
sarah
each
with
her
and
her
pride
the
enchanting
spoiled
young
daughter
of
america
and
spain
with
her
poet
and
the
elderly
woman
austere
as
her
own
new
england
her
shoulders
bent
in
my
service
with
a
good
man
of
her
own
kind
well
father
was
left
to
me
thank
god
but
i
felt
terribly
lonely
chapter
xix
the
morning
the
howells
car
came
to
take
mercedes
and
wright
to
havana
and
the
mendez
dance
howells
came
with
it
she
would
not
wait
for
luncheon
but
had
a
little
talk
with
me
while
mercedes
in
a
flutter
was
collecting
her
things
it
was
a
very
little
talk
and
consisted
mostly
in
shruggings
of
the
maternal
shoulders
lifting
of
the
placid
maternal
brows
and
phrases
unspoken
questions
and
she
left
indolently
satisfied
the
had
won
her
i
foresaw
a
cloudless
sky
of
courtship
for
wright
as
far
as
his
mercedes
mother
was
concerned
mercedes
promising
to
return
wright
on
the
morrow
was
reluctant
to
go
i
been
so
happy
here
she
whispered
as
she
kissed
me
you
never
know
how
happy
and
i
so
grateful
mavis
she
kissed
bill
too
when
her
mother
back
was
turned
the
merest
ghost
of
a
caress
brushing
his
cheek
accompanied
by
a
little
giggle
of
pure
mischief
and
he
patted
her
slim
shoulders
with
a
tolerant
hand
as
he
bade
her
run
along
and
enjoy
her
party
my
aunt
said
wright
to
me
tragically
could
you
persuade
the
old
lady
to
sit
in
the
front
seat
with
that
brigand
in
a
uniform
who
is
driving
the
car
i
waved
them
farewell
with
a
sinking
at
my
heart
it
was
as
if
youth
and
gaiety
were
leaving
me
hand
in
hand
with
never
a
backward
glance
i
did
not
see
bill
again
until
luncheon
an
hour
later
it
was
one
of
our
silent
meals
although
we
talked
in
a
desultory
manner
while
the
slippered
servitors
were
in
the
room
bill
passed
me
salt
after
the
manner
of
an
ancient
monarch
handing
poison
with
deadly
courtesy
i
responded
with
pepper
and
after
wing
and
fong
had
left
us
at
the
end
of
the
meal
i
tried
desperately
to
make
small
talk
i
miss
mercedes
so
much
i
said
and
wright
too
no
answer
it
looks
like
a
match
said
i
presently
it
does
said
bill
gloomily
i
waited
wright
crazy
about
her
proffered
my
husband
after
a
time
leaning
back
in
his
chair
did
he
tell
you
so
i
asked
curiously
kept
me
up
one
whole
night
expatiating
on
her
charms
and
his
extreme
unworthiness
he
replied
i
laughed
when
i
think
of
the
things
he
said
about
her
at
first
leopardess
and
you
take
him
for
a
lion
tamer
i
said
it
really
is
funny
a
little
antagonism
at
the
outset
said
bill
blowing
neat
rings
is
very
good
for
the
course
of
true
love
sometimes
i
was
silent
of
course
said
bill
positively
growling
it
a
lottery
anyway
he
was
so
absurd
so
so
that
i
wanted
to
mother
him
i
had
seen
peterkins
just
like
that
when
things
went
after
all
i
thought
it
must
be
trying
to
be
even
temporarily
bound
to
a
woman
you
dislike
so
much
speaking
of
lotteries
i
said
lightly
you
have
heard
the
results
of
the
last
drawing
have
you
no
he
answered
but
silas
is
counting
the
hours
until
the
afternoon
when
the
papers
come
up
he
bought
half
a
dozen
tickets
from
that
chap
who
rode
up
here
the
other
day
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
called
the
garage
on
the
phone
by
a
miracle
silas
was
there
and
i
heard
bill
ask
him
the
number
of
his
tickets
then
jotting
them
down
he
called
havana
and
some
mysterious
person
and
asked
for
the
winning
numbers
as
he
spoke
in
rapid
spanish
i
was
forced
to
wait
until
he
turned
from
the
phone
to
say
by
george
silas
has
made
a
killing
i
jumped
up
and
was
at
his
elbow
when
he
put
the
receiver
down
oh
what
is
it
i
asked
fairly
dancing
with
excitement
not
the
big
prize
he
answered
but
for
all
of
that
sarah
will
die
of
joy
i
began
so
it
true
then
said
bill
interrupting
true
as
true
i
answered
and
i
think
it
splendid
i
thought
there
was
something
afoot
said
bill
when
silas
asked
for
a
job
with
me
i
was
glad
to
give
him
one
he
can
be
useful
to
me
in
a
hundred
ways
he
a
corker
they
could
build
a
little
house
at
the
back
of
the
garden
father
would
be
so
pleased
i
said
eagerly
sarah
would
leave
me
you
know
i
stopped
bill
with
his
hat
in
his
hands
turned
it
will
be
difficult
to
arrange
that
he
said
as
you
have
made
other
plans
and
i
shall
leave
green
hill
so
i
am
afraid
he
concluded
evenly
that
a
house
in
the
garden
unless
wish
to
keep
silas
on
would
be
quite
feasible
he
went
out
with
that
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
had
pulled
myself
together
and
gone
in
to
tell
sarah
the
news
i
saw
her
later
flying
in
a
most
indecorous
manner
toward
the
garage
and
knew
that
she
and
silas
would
presently
be
sitting
on
the
step
of
the
car
building
in
green
hill
with
their
new
fortune
well
i
knew
that
one
of
them
would
be
reared
in
the
back
of
my
little
garden
just
as
i
thoughtless
enough
had
one
it
would
be
fair
to
hurt
sarah
now
i
told
myself
i
would
wait
till
we
were
home
sarah
would
be
sorry
she
liked
bill
but
father
would
keep
both
sarah
and
silas
on
the
place
needed
a
permanent
but
there
were
breakers
ahead
bitter
waters
i
was
to
be
spared
nothing
nothing
to
the
final
humiliation
there
was
a
letter
from
father
when
the
mail
came
in
it
necessary
to
set
it
down
here
suffice
it
to
say
that
something
i
had
said
in
my
last
letter
about
his
generosity
to
me
had
called
forth
a
denial
that
the
bit
of
to
make
you
feel
independent
dear
amounted
to
anything
and
then
a
word
about
the
income
bill
had
settled
on
me
i
think
you
should
know
mavis
he
concluded
although
i
am
breaking
word
with
bill
he
told
me
he
did
want
your
small
unworldly
head
to
be
bothered
with
money
matters
but
it
is
time
that
you
learned
to
be
practical
he
mentioned
the
little
allowance
he
had
insisted
on
making
me
it
would
hardly
have
paid
for
my
shoes
and
eventually
it
was
clear
to
me
that
the
money
in
the
bank
my
clothes
my
lovingly
purchased
gifts
for
my
friends
sarah
wages
my
many
extravagances
since
coming
to
cuba
everything
everything
had
come
from
the
one
source
bill
and
i
more
ignorant
than
any
child
about
the
value
of
money
had
not
even
asked
except
once
and
then
he
had
lied
to
me
had
told
me
it
was
my
money
my
father
money
and
all
the
time
i
had
been
living
on
charity
how
well
he
knew
me
that
he
took
the
chance
that
i
would
not
ask
father
for
a
definite
statement
of
what
allowance
he
was
making
me
i
was
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
dismay
it
seemed
as
if
this
were
the
proverbial
last
straw
they
make
gold
out
of
straws
do
they
my
sick
brain
inquired
childishly
it
was
hard
to
think
coherently
i
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
the
garage
silas
answered
i
managed
somehow
to
congratulate
him
on
the
lottery
drawing
before
i
asked
him
to
find
denton
please
and
ask
him
to
come
up
to
the
house
if
he
were
not
too
busy
i
wished
to
speak
to
him
ten
full
wretched
minutes
i
endured
before
he
came
is
anything
the
matter
he
asked
bursting
in
precipitately
mutely
i
gave
him
the
letter
he
read
it
and
crumpled
the
sheets
in
his
hand
instantly
on
the
defensive
well
he
said
was
there
any
reason
to
lie
to
me
i
quietly
you
must
have
known
that
sooner
or
later
i
would
know
if
not
now
then
when
i
saw
father
again
i
think
my
eyes
warned
him
that
this
was
a
time
for
very
plain
speaking
i
had
hoped
he
answered
after
a
little
pause
to
persuade
your
father
to
bear
me
out
in
what
i
believed
a
harmless
enough
after
all
he
added
breaking
my
persistent
silence
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
to
your
father
that
you
refused
to
let
me
support
you
i
am
sorry
i
said
rather
more
gently
than
i
felt
to
have
been
more
of
a
burden
on
you
than
i
knew
had
i
known
had
i
for
one
instant
dreamed
that
i
would
be
dependent
on
you
i
would
never
have
consented
to
this
arrangement
this
may
sound
very
foolish
i
know
and
i
see
now
how
impossible
it
all
would
have
been
but
this
is
how
i
felt
and
you
i
think
knew
he
nodded
eyes
on
mine
yes
said
he
you
have
had
a
very
pretty
revenge
i
told
him
each
word
dropping
like
a
cold
little
stone
into
the
hush
of
the
big
room
you
must
have
laughed
often
to
yourself
no
doubt
it
has
been
very
amusing
waiting
for
the
bubble
to
break
if
you
will
make
me
out
a
statement
as
nearly
as
you
can
of
just
how
much
i
am
indebted
to
you
i
will
try
to
repay
you
little
by
little
i
felt
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
the
utter
arrogance
and
futility
of
my
words
as
i
spoke
them
but
i
had
to
speak
please
he
flung
out
a
protesting
hand
why
do
you
fret
yourself
with
trifles
are
you
not
willing
to
make
some
further
sacrifice
for
your
father
when
the
time
comes
for
us
to
separate
i
had
hoped
after
all
it
would
be
only
the
usual
thing
to
do
to
make
you
an
allowance
did
you
intend
to
consult
me
about
it
i
asked
furiously
he
hesitated
please
answer
i
said
at
my
tone
he
raised
his
eyebrows
ever
so
slightly
i
am
waiting
i
announced
with
dangerous
patience
well
i
admit
the
situation
seemed
difficult
but
it
was
in
the
future
he
answered
finally
and
i
thought
perhaps
never
mind
you
would
have
gone
out
of
my
life
with
the
amusing
knowledge
that
you
had
a
hold
on
me
to
a
certain
extent
it
was
well
planned
i
said
growing
colder
and
colder
minute
by
minute
until
in
the
sunny
warmth
of
the
windows
i
shivered
uncontrollably
but
you
must
have
thought
me
even
more
of
an
imbecile
than
i
am
i
owe
you
i
ended
a
large
sum
of
money
when
we
are
separated
when
father
gets
used
to
that
fact
and
when
he
realizes
how
well
i
am
how
strong
there
will
be
some
sort
of
work
for
me
somewhere
i
am
sure
that
will
both
occupy
my
time
and
enable
me
to
repay
you
work
said
bill
and
then
under
his
breath
my
god
he
was
angry
i
knew
hurt
i
felt
and
i
was
glad
i
am
not
a
charity
patient
dr
denton
i
said
and
left
the
room
the
rest
of
that
day
is
a
blank
to
me
now
if
i
had
suffered
before
i
suffered
a
now
i
could
not
look
at
the
miniature
i
was
even
angry
with
father
dearest
father
who
had
done
his
human
best
for
me
i
hated
myself
i
hated
life
i
wanted
to
die
to
be
laughed
at
to
have
had
my
little
defiances
and
independences
met
with
the
secret
thought
the
very
clothes
on
her
back
were
bought
with
my
money
to
have
been
fooled
and
fooled
again
to
his
heart
content
to
have
lived
on
the
bounty
of
a
man
who
despised
me
hurt
and
wounded
me
at
every
turn
it
was
unbearable
when
i
was
home
again
when
the
tangle
finally
became
unraveled
i
would
go
to
uncle
john
i
would
ask
him
frankly
what
to
do
tell
him
the
whole
bitter
little
story
ask
him
to
find
work
for
me
reading
proof
correcting
manuscript
scrubbing
floors
i
did
care
there
were
business
schools
i
thought
vaguely
and
cursed
the
years
of
invalidism
which
had
kept
from
me
so
much
knowledge
of
the
world
so
unfitted
me
to
cope
with
it
once
i
was
on
my
material
feet
father
need
never
know
he
would
think
it
a
whim
would
be
i
imagined
even
a
little
proud
would
believe
even
that
i
sought
to
distract
myself
after
the
wreck
of
my
married
life
other
women
had
done
the
same
thing
i
thought
of
the
city
as
i
had
seen
it
the
crowds
and
the
loneliness
and
the
bleakness
of
the
streets
the
hurrying
uncaring
people
i
had
read
of
girls
in
the
city
the
indignities
of
the
boarding
house
the
strain
and
the
demand
and
the
difficult
way
that
lies
before
the
untrained
mavis
of
green
hill
in
a
new
york
office
i
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
and
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
frightened
me
i
could
cry
somehow
i
had
a
tear
left
i
could
only
clench
and
unclench
my
hands
on
the
lap
of
the
little
mauve
gown
which
william
denton
had
bought
for
me
i
wondered
if
goodrich
knew
it
had
been
she
who
had
attended
to
all
my
purchases
before
i
left
green
hill
who
had
gone
into
town
with
my
measurements
and
returned
with
two
trunks
full
of
everything
i
needed
and
assured
me
that
the
bill
was
taken
care
of
what
a
fool
i
had
been
i
did
not
go
out
to
tea
sarah
brought
me
something
in
my
room
i
told
her
i
had
a
headache
it
was
the
truth
and
through
my
closed
door
i
could
hear
bill
voice
asking
for
me
crowell
was
there
he
had
ridden
over
some
time
before
i
sent
my
regrets
and
stayed
in
my
room
at
dinner
i
hardly
spoke
i
was
too
conscious
of
the
clothes
i
wore
the
food
i
ate
the
one
burdened
me
the
other
choked
me
bill
which
was
unusual
talked
nervously
all
through
the
meal
about
everything
and
nothing
even
through
the
dull
sense
of
impotence
and
anger
that
possessed
me
i
could
see
that
he
was
excited
waiting
for
something
waiting
perhaps
for
me
to
reopen
the
last
painful
chapter
he
could
wait
i
thought
we
had
just
been
served
with
salad
when
fong
came
in
brushed
wing
aside
and
bent
over
bill
saying
something
very
low
a
little
gleam
of
some
inner
excitement
came
into
the
eyes
he
flung
down
his
napkin
tell
juan
to
wait
he
said
and
rose
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
formally
to
me
but
i
am
afraid
that
you
must
eat
your
dinner
alone
someone
has
come
up
from
the
village
to
see
me
juan
i
asked
is
annunciata
ill
again
no
no
he
was
clearly
impatient
and
started
from
the
room
shall
i
have
norah
save
some
dinner
for
you
i
asked
mechanically
do
bother
he
said
hesitated
and
then
suddenly
crossing
the
room
in
four
strides
he
was
beside
me
i
felt
his
hand
on
my
hair
and
stiffened
under
the
unaccustomed
touch
the
hand
dropped
to
his
side
do
think
so
badly
of
me
mavis
he
said
even
if
you
have
been
a
patient
do
you
know
the
bible
meaning
of
charity
before
i
could
speak
he
was
gone
he
had
not
changed
for
dinner
a
real
innovation
and
was
in
riding
things
i
heard
the
ring
of
the
little
spurs
he
wore
on
the
tiles
and
the
sound
of
a
closing
door
the
bible
meaning
of
charity
but
that
was
that
was
love
what
did
he
mean
a
i
sat
my
hands
under
my
chin
while
wing
came
and
went
with
the
untasted
food
a
something
terribly
sweet
and
keen
pierced
my
heart
it
could
be
love
was
like
that
cruel
and
wounding
and
hurting
love
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
that
was
in
the
bible
too
love
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
seeketh
not
its
own
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
love
never
faileth
the
big
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
never
if
it
was
true
then
oh
god
let
it
be
true
i
prayed
mutely
if
it
were
true
then
how
blind
i
had
been
sacrifice
patience
hope
would
he
have
done
so
much
for
someone
he
despised
even
for
revenge
i
began
to
remember
there
were
voices
outside
loud
excited
almost
hysterical
was
bill
there
i
waited
for
him
in
my
chair
i
had
not
moved
he
would
find
me
as
he
had
left
me
perhaps
he
had
come
back
to
tell
me
what
he
had
meant
charity
love
the
door
flew
open
and
sarah
burst
in
she
was
crying
i
saw
that
at
once
and
wanted
to
say
to
her
so
you
have
heard
it
is
true
sarah
it
was
charity
after
all
it
was
love
but
she
came
straight
to
me
and
caught
desperately
at
my
hands
miss
mavis
the

but
those
devils
fired
the
cane
while
he
was
in
this
very
house
fields
of
it
in
flame
and
silas
there
she
was
in
a
chair
now
her
apron
twisted
between
her
fingers
the
sobs
taking
her
by
the
throat
funny
that
she
could
cry
like
that
i
thought
watching
her
i
must
give
her
something
to
make
her
stop
if
bill
were
here
bill
i
must
have
screamed
sarah
her
arms
around
me

a
minute

herself
in
hand
there
there
she
said
soothingly
they
be
all
right
i
am
sure
you
to
be
calm
miss
mavis
and
not
take
on
so
calm
with
the
far
country
just
within
reach
and
the
fire
sweeping
across
the
i
put
her
away
from
me
go
to
the
kitchen
sarah
dear
i
said
very
quietly
and
wait
for
news

wing
and
fong
gone

she
nodded
i
wait
here
i
said
i
had
better
get
out
the
doctor
kit
and
all
the
things
someone
may
be
burned
she
sobbed
at
that
but
turned
and
went
to
the
kitchen
i
went
into
bill
room
for
a
minute
i
did
nothing
only
touched
the
things
on
his
bureau
his
brush
his
comb
a
little
of
me
stood
there
of
me
in
a
i
had
forgotten
that
i
opened
a
leather
case
which
stood
on
the
bureau
it
had
his
initials
on
it
and
a
small
key
lay
beside
it
opened
it
and
saw
my
letters
to
richard
warren
they
were
tossed
together
as
if
he
had
been
reading
them
he
had
told
me
that
he
never
kept
letters
somehow
i
found
the
things
and
the
little
emergency
case
they
were
on
the
table
by
his
bed
and
then
taking
them
into
the
i
called
out
to
sarah
to
find
some
linen
and
tear
it
into
sheets
we
had
very
little
gauze
in
the
house
my
hands
on
the
kit
i
sat
down
to
think
it
was
too
bad
wright
was
not
here
he
would
not
lose
his
head
but
mercedes
would
i
was
glad
she
was
in
havana
suddenly
i
laughed
to
think
of
them
dancing
at
the
mendez
ball
sarah
came
in
her
hands
full
of
an
old
sheet
any
news
i
asked
steadily
it
going
fast
she
said
dully
you
can
see
it
i
went
to
the
window
the
whole
sky
was
crimson
i
saw
the
smoke
wreathing
up
through
the
flame
fancied
that
i
heard
shouts
strained
my
eyes
for
the
sight
of
a
tall
lean
figure
he
would
come
soon
i
knew
and
tell
me
that
it
had
been
a
nightmare
that
he
was
safe
that
he
had
been
in
no
danger
i
looked
around
sarah
had
gone
out
quietly
no
one
was
there
softly
i
went
across
the
room
opened
the
door
and
slipped
like
a
ghost
into
the
menacing
night
i
walked
at
first
then
ran
the
plants
and
trees
caught
at
my
dress
they
wanted
to
hold
me
back
i
shook
myself
free
and
went
on
nearer
and
nearer
how
much
smoke
there
was
the
whole
last
crop
gone
thousands
of
arrobas
of
sugar
gone
in
a
breath
good
loyal
juan
i
thought
as
i
went
on
stumbling
falling
once
to
my
knees
my
dress
was
ruined
bill
will
buy
me
another
i
said
aloud
not
charity
love
suddenly
i
was
in
the
midst
of
it
the
flame
and
the
smoke
the
hurrying
figures
black
with
soot
and
sweat
digging
the
trenches
that
might
save
the
cane
bill
my
own
voice
pierced
through
the
smoke
and
crackle
i
was
going
on
i
would
not
stop
until
i
had
found
him
was
that
bill
blackened
a
figure
in
a
dream
his
shirt
burned
away
from
one
bare
shoulder
there
were
red
marks
on
his
shoulder
he
did
hear
me
did
he
want
to
was
he
angry
i
was
sorry
i
had
been
so
foolish
but
i
had
known
that
he
cared
why
had
he
told
me
or
had
he
tried
to
and
i
would
listen
bill
a
spark
on
my
dress
a
glare
and
a
flame
i
was
part
of
the
roaring
and
the
smoke
and
the
crimson
glare
about
me
beating
at
the
little
licking
red
tongues
with
ineffectual
hands
death
then
but
i
wanted
to
live
it
was
fair
bill
his
arms
about
me
his
bare
hands
crushing
out
the
flames
his
agonized
voice
in
my
ears
mavis
my
darling
i
was
safe
i
tried
to
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
but
they
fell
weakly
to
my
side
he
took
my
hands
in
his
and
clasped
them
where
they
belonged
i
was
lifted
borne
swiftly
through
the
night
crimson
flame
and
smoke
a
roaring
a
voice
pleading
with
me
to
raise
my
head
to
answer
only
to
speak
darkness
chapter
xx
once
in
the
night
i
awoke
fully
before
that
there
had
been
periods
of
and
then
a
deep
restful
sleep
but
just
for
a
minute
i
was
abnormally
conscious
bill
he
was
sitting
beside
the
bed
the
light
was
very
dim
his
hand
was
on
my
bandaged
hand
which
was
lying
over
the
sheet
dearest
you
all
right
i
well
he
said
and
you
will
be
much
better
in
the
morning
close
the
dear
eyes
now
and
sleep
you
wo
go
away
never
go
to
sleep
mavis
in
the
morning
he
was
still
there
sleeping
wrapped
in
his
funny
fuzzy
bathrobe
in
a
big
chair
close
to
the
bed
his
hand
was
still
on
mine
i
looked
for
a
long
minute
at
his
tired
face
one
eyebrow
was
burned
almost
all
off
there
were
marks
of
burns
on
his
face
and
he
was
smiling
in
his
sleep
i
felt
so
rested
so
very
well
except
for
a
languor
and
a
weakness
my
hands
pained
me
both
i
was
amused
to
discover
were
bandaged
there
was
a
little
burn
on
my
arm
through
water
and
fire
good
morning
said
bill
smiling
at
me
i
closed
my
eyes
against
the
look
in
his
it
was
beautiful
to
have
him
look
at
me
so
but
i
could
not
bear
it
morning
said
i
and
felt
the
hot
color
flood
my
face
from
the
tips
of
my
toes
to
the
roots
of
my
hair
i
was
blushing
it
was
very
early
the
sudden
tropical
dawn
was
only
a
few
minutes
old
there
was
a
riot
of
outside
the
window
and
a
wonderful
breeze
blowing
through
the
room
mavis
said
bill
he
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
i
put
out
one
bandaged
hand
and
clumsily
touched
his
hair
do
you
know
what
you
done
he
asked
been
a
fool
as
usual
i
suggested
looking
ruefully
at
the
bandages
sweet
little
fool
he
said
in
that
new
deep
voice
mavis
how
could
you
you
frightened
me
almost
to
death
i
thought
of
those
leaping
flames
the
angry
crimson
sky
and
shuddered
i
sorry
i
said
meekly
he
gave
a
little
low
laugh
under
his
quickened
breath
you
love
me
announced
my
husband
arrogantly
beginning
as
usual
at
the
wrong
end
why
so
i
do
i
admitted
in
a
small
voice
his
arms
went
around
me
gently
closely
and
i
shut
my
eyes
under
the
touch
of
his
lips
on
their
lids
the
were
singing
in
the
room
in
my
heart
i
love
you
said
bill
and
kissed
my
mouth
i
lay
quite
still
then
between
tears
and
laughter
it
has
taken
you
i
said
a
very
long
time
to
find
it
out
it
took
me
he
contradicted
pleasantly
about
three
minutes
from
the
very
first
darling
me
too
said
i
in
utter
astonishment
it
was
true
from
the
very
first
i
had
fought
a
good
fight
i
thought
as
i
lay
there
in
my
utter
content
against
this
heavenly
surrender
i
pity
men
who
never
know
this
wonderful
release
of
self
followed
a
of
the
most
ridiculous
when
did
you
first
do
you
remember
how
could
you
say
whose
girl
are
you
mavis
tell
me
and
all
the
rest
of
the
eternal
litany
of
lovers
sarah
peeped
in
to
see
how
i
was
silas
i
discovered
from
her
beaming
countenance
was
all
right
i
had
forgotten
to
ask
it
was
with
assumed
enthusiasm
that
i
heard
that
a
portion
of
the
cane
had
been
saved
it
really
did
matter
not
to
me
nothing
mattered
only
bill
and
my
sense
of
harbor
in
the
far
country
of
my
dreams
such
a
nice
fire
i
said
happily
my
face
on
bill
one
unscarred
shoulder
you
little
wretch
he
kissed
me
again
norah
arrived
with
a
very
early
breakfast
i
twisted
in
bill
hold
to
no
avail
bar
again
such
strong
bars
so
tender
so
utterly
protective
what
the
matter
norah
but
said
bill
in
triumph
after
the
door
had
been
shut
behind
the
smiling
woman
after
all
mavis
we
married
why
so
we
are
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
stared
at
him
it
not
fair
said
i
hotly
what
we
not
even
been
engaged
i
said
or
anything
i
do
like
it
do
you
honestly
i
shook
my
head
and
then
nodded
violently
you
darling
said
my
new
bill
you
lovely
little
thing
i
adore
you
why
did
you
tell
me
so
before
i
asked
in
what
was
a
deplorably
peevish
tone
tell
you
and
get
my
face
slapped
you
were
the
prickliest
small
porcupine
for
all
your
soft
ways
rather
not
but
gosh
said
bill
it
was
hard
you
might
have
saved
us
a
lot
of
trouble
said
i
reproachfully
he
got
to
his
feet
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
might
i
i
did
know
you
see
i
had
had
your
repeated
assurance
that
you
regarded
me
as
dirt
under
your
little
feet
how
could
i
tell
you
you
were
awfully
stupid
said
i
with
keen
satisfaction
but
he
was
kissing
my
protruding
stiffly
through
the
neat
bandaging
dear
little
hands
he
said
oh
mavis
if
anything
had
happened
to
you
if
anything
had
happened
to
said
i
and
for
a
moment
we
looked
at
each
other
in
a
sort
of
blind
horror
presently
he
smiled
but
we
as
right
as
rain
said
he
we
young
all
life
before
us
and
we
love
each
other
thank
god
he
ended
on
a
deep
grave
note
thank
god
said
i
and
put
my
arms
up
to
him
when
he
raised
his
head
his
eyes
were
shining
my
beloved
wife
said
bill
i
put
him
from
me
for
a
moment
looked
into
his
eyes
please
i
said
very
low
it
all
so
new
and
a
little
terrifying
i
i
did
know
i
could
feel
like
this
will
you
let
us
go
on
just
as
we
are
for
a
little
while
perhaps
i
silly
but
i
ca
help
it
please
i
begged
wo
you
let
me
get
a
little
used
to
you
his
eyes
were
very
tender
now
of
course
he
said
you
know
that
a
real
engagement
said
i
happily
that
the
best
thing
after
all
said
bill
laughing
married
first
and
then
engaged
for
the
rest
of
one
life
he
held
me
very
closely
i
cherish
you
always
he
said
all
my
life
long
i
wanted
you
so
mavis
you
never
know
god
bless
you
my
dearest
father
i
said
in
my
heart
you
were
right
you
knew
i
so
happy
and
my
heart
answered
me
where
are
you
going
said
i
sternly
to
my
husband
as
he
laid
me
back
on
my
pillows
and
turned
away
outside
said
he
with
the
old
impish
grin
to
dance
a
fandango
on
the
lawn
and
incidentally
to
put
on
some
clothes
and
pretend
an
intelligent
interest
which
i
do
in
the
least
experience
in
harry
reynolds
destroyed
bless
those
incendiary
natives
he
added
piously
back
soon
i
asked
do
look
at
me
like
that
said
bill
severely
or
i
wo
be
able
to
go
as
your
physician
i
forbid
you
to
endanger
my
pulse
it
is
hardly
normal
now
try
and
rest
dear
and
when
i
come
back
i
want
to
see
more
steady
color
in
your
cheeks
you
had
a
pretty
bad
shock
mavis
i
should
say
i
have
i
said
in
tones
i
vainly
tried
to
infuse
with
how
about
yourself
he
blew
me
a
kiss
just
a
mean
tiny
one
and
vanished
without
answering
but
poked
his
head
in
at
the
door
immediately
after
to
ask
seriously
shall
i
bring
you
a
statement
of
your
indebtedness
to
me
when
i
return
mrs
denton
i
wish
i
cost
you
more
said
i
crossly
you
just
wait
i
going
to
buy
a
trousseau
when
i
get
to
new
york
that
will
put
you
in
the
i
afraid
said
i
primly
that
i
must
ask
you
to
wait
for
your
settlement
doctor
i
keep
you
so
in
debt
he
declared
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
struggle
out
and
you
pay
me
in
love
young
person
for
every
sleepless
night
i
spent
and
every
swear
i
sworn
behind
closed
doors
and
for
every
time
i
wanted
to
take
you
in
my
arms
and
kiss
you
till
you
cried
for
mercy
i
think
i
should
have
cried
i
said
reflectively
he
was
back
in
the
room
again
for
heaven
sake
said
i
extricating
myself
with
some
difficulty
what
will
people
think
door
open
and
everything
but
it
was
fully
ten
minutes
before
he
really
went
i
closed
my
eyes
and
with
father
miniature
under
my
pillow
tried
to
sleep
so
happy
so
happy
it
was
hard
to
lie
still
and
think
so
i
did
think
i
kissed
the
ring
on
my
finger
under
the
bandages
half
a
dozen
times
and
slept
at
last
drifting
from
dream
into
dream
life
was
very
wonderful
and
the
love
that
had
suffered
and
strayed
was
the
most
perfect
at
the
last
for
all
the
times
i
had
hurt
him
how
i
would
repay
my
husband
with
depth
on
depth
of
devotion
i
would
make
it
up
to
him
through
water
and
fire
chapter
xxi
the
boat
pulled
slowly
away
from
the
docks
standing
at
the
rail
i
could
plainly
see
the
brilliant
feather
on
mercedes
little
french
hat
nodding
in
the
breeze
a
fleck
of
white
was
in
her
hand
now
fluttering
frantically
now
at
her
eyes
wright
beside
her
was
gesticulating
like
a
semaphore
and
not
far
away
silas
was
straining
his
keen
eyes
to
catch
the
last
glimpse
of
his
sarah
presently
the
docks
faded
into
a
blur
and
bill
pulled
me
away
from
the
rail
cuba
i
said
waving
my
hand
for
the
last
time
as
i
turned
you
not
crying
he
asked
teasingly
no
i
dried
my
eyes
a
little
defiantly
but
i
have
loved
it
so
color
and
warmth
and
sunshine
i
said
watching
the
soft
pastel
shades
of
the
shore
line
where
morro
castle
stood
dazzling
in
the
light
its
stone
feet
set
in
blue
waters
and
i
hated
to
leave
somehow
we
go
back
said
he
no
do
go
below
sarah
will
unpack
and
settle
for
you
i
bribed
the
steward
to
give
us
these
chairs
sit
down
darling
and
let
me
tuck
you
up
obediently
i
sat
and
he
sprawled
his
long
length
beside
me
cupping
his
pipe
in
his
hands
to
shield
the
match
flare
from
the
wind
but
i
argued
it
wo
be
like
going
back
to
palms
hate
the
nasty
people
who
are
going
to
buy
it
do
you
suppose
buy
arthur
too
do
you
want
him
asked
bill
i
turned
my
hand
so
that
the
light
fell
on
the
big
new
diamond
on
my
finger
bill
had
bought
it
in
havana
two
days
after
the
fire
it
was
my
engagement
ring
he
said
and
i
had
gotten
up
more
than
once
in
the
last
few
nights
to
admire
it
by
candle
or
moonlight
it
was
like
a
drop
of
dew
i
told
him
that
when
he
gave
it
to
me
and
he
had
added
on
a
white
flower
and
had
kissed
the
finger
he
slipped
it
on
want
arthur
i
think
not
he
be
the
scandal
of
green
hill
and
perhaps
he
not
thrive
away
from
guayabal
shall
i
buy
palms
asked
bill
pushing
his
cap
back
from
his
forehead
so
that
the
sun
fell
across
his
face
are
you
crazy
i
demanded
possibly
he
slipped
his
hand
under
the
rug
across
my
knees
and
took
mine
what
do
you
think
he
asked
gravely
i
think
you
are
said
i
such
extravagance
delusions
of
grandeur
but
anyway
i
rather
we
built
our
own
house
so
would
i
said
bill
with
satisfaction
could
we
add
to
the
green
hill
house
i
asked
an
office
for
you
and
more
rooms
do
you
mind
i
said
so
much
of
me
is
in
that
house
i
do
want
to
forget
those
years
and
i
was
born
there
my
mother
came
there
as
a
bride
and
i
think
father
will
want
us
to
live
there
always
unless
i
added
careful
you
have
other
plans
doctor
denton
bill
laughed
no
when
we
get
home
if
your
father
is
willing
i
turn
you
loose
with
painters
and
carpenters
and
decorators
as
long
as
i
may
always
smoke
even
in
the
parlour
and
as
long
as
you
do
banish
me
and
my
bottles
to
the
garage
for
we
have
to
have
a
garage
you
know
and
i
spoken
to
silas
about
that
little
house
in
the
garden
there
lots
of
room
chintz
i
said
dreamily
creton
lots
of
it
and
another
fireplace
and
oodles
of
bookshelves
bill
may
i
dig
in
the
garden
next
summer
i
should
wonder
he
answered
cheerfully
you
really
remarkably
strong
beyond
my
wildest
hopes
i
was
amazed
to
see
how
soon
you
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
fire
i
looked
at
the
little
scars
on
my
hands
they
would
go
eventually
i
knew
bill
had
said
so
i
was
a
little
sorry
were
you
i
asked
but
i
had
a
very
good
doctor
and
wonderful
medicine
he
kissed
me
to
the
horror
of
a
passing
elderly
couple
then
said
i
straightening
my
cap
you
practise
in
green
hill
after
all
people
will
say
you
be
burying
yourself
there
let
said
bill
i
shall
have
time
at
last
for
all
the
things
i
want
to
do
time
ambition
and
encouragement
we
have
a
laboratory
away
from
the
house
so
your
little
nose
wo
be
offended
and
turn
up
even
more
it
does
said
i
one
hand
to
the
insulted
feature
it
does
do
contradict
i
love
it
a
laboratory
he
went
on
and
i
can
work
again
on
that
oh
bill
i
said
is
it
wonderful
to
think
that
perhaps
you
can
bring
a
blessing
to
all
the
world
and
i
may
help
a
little
we
were
silent
for
a
while
such
a
comfortable
understanding
silence
aunt
mavis
said
peter
appearing
suddenly
on
deck
sarah
has
gone
to
bed
is
she
ill
i
asked
viewing
the
water
which
was
like
blue
glass
not
yet
said
peter
gravely
but
she
says
she
taking
no
chances
poor
sarah
i
said
as
bill
laughed
stay
here
with
your
uncle
peterkins
and
i
go
and
see
if
i
can
do
anything
for
her
when
i
returned
i
found
my
young
charge
and
my
husband
hanging
perilously
over
the
rail
watching
the
antics
of
the
are
they
pretty
i
asked
joining
them
like
tiny
colored
aeroplanes
we
watched
for
some
time
in
silence
and
then
peter
growing
sleepy
for
we
had
gotten
up
very
early
that
morning
bill
tucked
him
into
a
rug
in
a
chair
and
we
left
him
asleep
almost
instantly
to
walk
the
deck
until
luncheon
i
got
a
scheme
said
bill
want
to
hear
said
i
new
york
first
uncle
john
or
if
you
rather
a
hotel
your
dad
will
meet
us
we
ship
sarah
on
to
green
hill
with
peter
to
get
the
house
in
order
and
to
look
after
the
boy
until
the
goodriches
return
when
is
it
ten
days
and
after
you
gone
on
that
shopping
orgy
you
threatened
me
with
i
have
one
of
the
men
bring
my
car
down
from
green
hill
and
we
motor
would
you
like
that
oh
bill
where
i
asked
skipping
a
little
and
collapsing
up
against
his
side
as
the
boat
rolled
cape
cod
i
thought
if
you
care
about
it
there
a
dear
old
inn
at
provincetown
i
know
you
love
it
we
could
go
there
for
a
week
or
so
it
so
early
yet
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
and
then
early
in
may
back
to
green
hill
and
settle
for
the
summer
what
do
you
think
i
think
you
a
darling
i
answered
brazenly
and
with
just
the
effect
i
had
calculated
and
after
we
had
told
each
other
several
times
that
no
one
in
the
world
could
be
as
happy
and
as
much
in
love
as
we
were
and
firmly
believed
it
too
i
bill
said
suddenly
i
cabled
mother
from
cuba
and
wrote
her
she
will
meet
us
in
new
york
for
heaven
sake
said
i
do
you
think
she
like
me
ca
tell
said
bill
solemnly
she
odd
but
after
all
it
is
as
if
you
were
a
stranger
you
corresponded
with
her
you
know
and
she
made
you
some
that
a
bond
but
that
was
richard
warren
mother
i
said
not
quite
convinced
she
mine
too
funny
is
it
i
think
you
committed
bigamy
is
she
really
little
and
and
i
asked
or
was
that
poetic
license
honest
truth
she
the
prettiest
thing
in
the
world
except
you
and
i
written
her
all
about
it
did
she
know
that
i
did
know
you
were
you
i
asked
somewhat
incoherently
but
he
understood
that
was
one
of
the
nice
things
about
bill
recently
anyway
he
was
the
person
who
understood
he
nodded
yes
but
she
did
know
everything
not
that
we
were
married
why
i
asked
curiously
he
smiled
down
at
me
very
big
very
protective
why
you
see
said
bill
gently
she
knew
that
i
loved
you
and
she
got
to
love
you
too
after
all
she
has
a
weakness
for
me
and
an
unbounded
faith
in
my
choice
and
so
well
i
did
want
to
disappoint
her
did
want
her
to
know
how
matters
stood
that
we
were
quite
happy
so
i
waited
after
a
while
i
grew
afraid
that
she
would
have
to
be
told
after
all
please
do
i
said
hastily
what
did
you
write
her
cabled
first
mavis
meet
us
in
new
york
at
uncle
john
as
soon
as
you
can
and
then
i
wrote
and
sent
it
by
someone
who
was
sailing
sooner
she
will
break
the
trip
from
california
in
chicago
she
has
cousins
there
i
hope
the
letter
will
catch
her
i
never
had
a
mother
i
said
the
least
bit
wistfully
you
have
one
now
said
bill
cuba
had
long
since
disappeared
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
second
to
keep
the
memory
of
all
we
had
left
clear
and
vivid
the
palms
the
cane
as
it
had
looked
before
the
fire
and
graceful
the
red
soil
of
guayabal
and
the
long
white
roads
the
mountains
in
the
distance
the
straight
as
arrows
with
their
rustling
tops
my
own
orchids
little
lavender
balloons
peacocks
and
naked
brown
babies
creeping
in
the
sun
sunlight
on
adobe
and
thatch
and
arthur
screaming
raucously
for
his
morning
coffee
no
i
would
never
forget
the
trip
passed
like
a
dream
peter
found
some
american
children
to
play
with
on
the
boat
and
romped
with
them
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
a
correct
english
nurse
sarah
with
wiggles
kept
to
her
cabin
and
bill
and
i
exchanging
polite
platitudes
with
the
people
at
our
table
were
left
very
much
to
ourselves
and
the
voyage
was
calm
totally
unlike
the
one
we
had
taken
so
many
months
before
it
was
on
the
boat
that
i
read
some
of
richard
warren
new
poems
part
of
the
new
volume
and
sitting
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
deck
i
watched
my
husband
write
the
dedication
across
a
white
sheet
of
paper
to
my
wife
i
very
proud
said
i
a
little
tremulously
they
are
beautiful
wright
knew
he
said
they
were
bigger
and
finer
than
the
others
but
i
added
after
all
i
fell
in
love
with
lyric
bill
but
these
said
bill
are
your
own
and
so
they
were
now
he
said
suppose
you
show
me
what
you
were
so
careful
to
hide
from
me
in
cuba
did
wright
i
began
indignantly
what
do
you
mean
no
wright
did
but
i
guessed
have
i
written
for
nothing
all
these
years
i
a
sleuth
when
it
comes
to
a
besides
there
this
he
drew
a
crumpled
sheet
from
his
inner
pocket
i
snatched
at
it
that
old
thing
said
i
with
scorn
where
did
you
find
it
i
could
account
for
your
inky
little
hands
and
your
fits
of
abstraction
he
answered
solely
by
an
explanation
of
your
love
for
and
your
dislike
of
me
where
did
you
find
it
creature
i
demanded
again
in
wright
pocket
old
coat
on
a
chair
i
was
looking
for
a
match
does
sound
plausible
said
i
spreading
out
the
blotted
paper
bill
read
with
me
over
my
shoulder
after
sunset
carved
in
dull
ebony
one
somber
row
of
straight
palms
etched
in
sudden
sharp
relief
against
a
afterglow
oh
hour
of
enchantment
past
belief
when
down
the
garden
paths
the
peacocks
go
in
plumed
splendor
and
with
stately
tread
across
the
shadowed
valleys
cool
winds
blow
from
where
the
mountain
rears
its
head
beyond
the
world
rim
slips
the
day
to
draw
night
curtain
close
about
her
bed
and
set
a
star
to
light
her
to
her
rest
while
evening
shaking
free
her
dusky
hair
lures
every
weary
bird
to
seek
its
nest
and
kissing
shut
the
tired
eyes
of
care
lulls
earth
to
peace
upon
her
gentle
breast
i
did
mean
you
to
know
i
said
as
he
took
the
verse
away
from
me
again
and
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
but
you
told
wright
said
he
that
was
different
i
answered
firmly
mad
he
slipped
his
arm
around
me
mavis
he
said
very
softly
mavis
with
the
amber
hair
and
the
deep
brown
eyes
mavis
child
and
poet
and
all
mine
you
not
laughing
i
asked
anxiously
i
mean
about
the
verses
laughing
he
raised
his
head
from
my
hair
my
cap
had
fallen
off
and
it
blew
in
wildest
confusion
about
my
face
and
his
i
very
far
from
laughing
i
proud
and
happy
but
said
he
with
a
change
of
tone
to
steal
my
thunder
you
be
dabbling
in
my
yet
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
reconcile
myself
to
being
known
as
husband
of
mavis
denton
appalling
outlook
is
it
i
asked
impishly
well
in
that
sense
at
least
of
the
poetess
it
wounds
my
masculine
pride
it
should
said
i
triumphantly
if
it
ever
happened
which
of
course
it
wo
but
i
will
be
quite
content
to
be
known
as
richard
warren
wife
you
dear
but
of
course
you
have
a
better
disposition
than
i
have
i
have
i
a
petulant
snappish
mean
you
the
loveliest
thing
god
ever
made
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
the
lazy
happy
trip
over
we
sailed
importantly
into
new
york
once
more
father
and
uncle
john
were
on
the
dock
two
bronzed
happy
men
and
it
was
late
that
night
before
i
got
to
sleep
in
that
same
room
my
head
in
a
perfect
whirl
how
we
had
talked
and
laughed
questioned
and
answered
from
the
twinkle
in
uncle
eyes
the
tenderest
most
quizzical
twinkle
i
that
he
knew
more
than
i
had
thought
he
did
say
so
but
if
he
know
well
he
had
developed
perfectly
miraculous
powers
of
teasing
since
i
had
left
but
he
was
a
dear
and
it
was
so
amazing
to
sit
there
and
listen
to
him
and
bill
discuss
the
new
volume
and
to
put
my
little
critical
oar
in
now
and
then
while
father
sat
by
my
hand
in
his
a
look
of
the
most
wonderful
content
on
his
face
they
had
great
difficulty
to
persuade
me
to
go
to
bed
it
was
fascinating
to
linger
in
the
smoky
old
room
with
its
rows
and
rows
of
books
and
its
untidy
comfortable
masculine
atmosphere
after
i
had
three
times
refused
to
leave
them
bill
unceremoniously
picked
me
up
and
carried
me
up
the
stairs
kicking
and
losing
my
slippers
on
the
way
did
i
say
that
a
wire
was
waiting
for
me
when
i
reached
uncle
john
love
to
you
both
it
read
will
be
with
you
wednesday
at
the
latest
and
it
was
addressed
to
me
and
signed
mother
wednesday
was
two
days
off
i
spent
the
intervening
time
in
the
outrageous
shops
bill
stalking
uneasily
behind
me
deferred
to
by
the
lithe
wonderfully
coiffured
purring
goddesses
who
paraded
mannequin
after
pretty
mannequin
before
my
startled
eyes
i
think
however
that
bill
was
a
little
more
embarrassed
than
i
how
they
live
he
said
to
me
seriously
on
one
occasion
i
see
i
should
think
they
spend
most
of
their
time
in
a
pneumonia
ward
we
drove
in
the
park
one
afternoon
it
was
gay
with
spring
flowers
and
pretty
girls
we
had
a
hansom
because
i
had
read
about
them
in
books
coming
back
through
the
falling
dusk
with
the
lights
of
the
city
twinkling
out
yellow
and
beckoning
and
the
great
massive
bulk
of
the
plaza
illuminated
like
a
birthday
cake
just
ahead
i
suddenly
conceived
an
affection
for
new
york
but
i
did
want
to
live
there
next
time
we
come
said
bill
in
the
fall
perhaps
i
want
to
take
you
to
the
theatres
and
to
the
gayest
restaurants
and
concerts
why
you
funny
child
your
eyes
are
as
big
as
saucers
our
lean
horse
stumbled
just
then
and
the
hansom
gave
a
seasick
lurch
i
felt
as
people
mounting
camels
must
feel
when
the
horse
and
i
had
somewhat
recovered
i
answered
i
love
it
and
you
teach
me
to
dance
sometime
may
i
well
said
bill
gravely
i
not
much
of
a
dancer
too
big
and
all
that
i
always
step
on
the
dear
things
feet
but
you
may
i
think
and
we
take
lessons
together
if
you
like
i
adore
it
i
said
my
husband
drew
me
close
you
baby
he
said
sometimes
i
think
i
have
been
selfish
tying
you
down
to
a
cross
old
husband
before
you
had
your
good
times
do
want
any
good
times
without
you
i
said
obstinately
all
right
said
he
we
have
them
together
i
renew
my
youth
do
be
absurd
you
a
mere
infant
second
childhood
he
said
you
been
an
elixir
of
youth
to
me
of
life
itself
you
do
say
such
nice
things
i
sighed
that
comes
of
being
a
poet
poet
be
hanged
said
bill
it
comes
of
being
in
love
with
you
with
you
that
was
a
very
nice
drive
after
all
the
hansom
has
advantages
one
can
sit
awfully
close
and
hold
hands
under
the
shiny
wooden
apron
wednesday
mother
came
i
called
her
that
right
off
she
was
the
dearest
thing
with
such
curly
red
hair
and
eyes
the
color
of
bill
only
a
different
shape
she
was
littler
than
i
even
with
hands
and
feet
that
were
wholly
ridiculous
father
was
immediately
enchanted
with
her
the
four
of
us
had
a
long
talk
all
one
soft
spring
day
interrupted
by
uncle
john
and
by
getting
peter
and
sarah
safely
off
to
green
hill
and
then
while
i
was
resting
she
had
her
talk
with
her
son
and
came
to
me
later
after
i
had
gone
to
bed
she
curled
up
beside
me
in
a
wonderful
blue
negligée
which
made
her
look
like
a
girl
and
we
talked
and
talked
you
the
nicest
thing
that
bill
has
given
me
i
said
happily
before
she
left
and
bill
the
nicest
thing
you
could
give
me
you
do
feel
i
begged
that
i
am
taking
him
away
from
you
i
love
you
she
answered
the
laughter
gone
from
her
eyes
and
her
face
very
sweet
to
see
for
yourself
for
bill
too
but
most
of
all
for
yourself
i
have
wanted
this
since
he
first
wrote
me
about
you
i
have
prayed
for
it
every
night
you
were
so
exactly
the
sort
of
a
girl
i
wanted
my
boy
to
marry
but
i
said
i
was
just
a
little
useless
creature
then
i
knew
that
bill
would
cure
you
said
mother
he
always
gets
what
he
wants
does
he
though
i
interrupted
proudly
and
he
wanted
you
i
love
him
so
i
whispered
against
the
soft
lace
at
her
breast
she
put
her
arms
very
closely
around
me
i
do
know
why
i
cried
and
then
she
talked
to
me
just
as
my
own
mother
would
have
done
very
gravely
and
tenderly
for
a
long
when
she
left
my
room
i
lay
awake
a
long
time
thinking
about
her
and
bill
wondering
if
i
could
ever
be
to
him
all
that
she
had
said
i
would
be
i
was
happy
a
little
frightened
and
so
grateful
so
grateful
chapter
xxii
the
entire
household
saw
us
off
on
our
motor
trip
uncle
john
beaming
cardigan
and
the
maids
waving
hands
and
aprons
mother
smiling
at
us
through
a
mist
she
was
coming
to
green
hill
as
soon
as
we
were
settled
and
help
me
with
my
first
housekeeping
she
had
demurred
at
first
when
i
begged
her
to
had
said
that
young
people
were
better
off
alone
but
i
and
then
bill
when
he
found
how
much
i
really
wanted
her
and
finally
father
had
overridden
all
her
objections
i
did
tell
my
menfolk
that
it
was
delightful
to
have
someone
to
whom
you
could
talk
bill
by
the
hour
and
who
never
grew
tired
of
listening
and
encouraging
and
interrupting
with
paeans
of
praise
of
her
own
what
will
she
think
of
mercedes
i
asked
as
we
rolled
through
the
city
out
toward
the
sunshine
and
open
spaces
she
like
her
said
bill
mother
a
judge
and
she
adopted
wright
long
ago
those
two
wild
children
i
said
tolerantly
the
maddest
cablegram
had
come
to
us
just
before
we
left
i
was
still
convulsed
by
it
mercedes
willing
wedding
in
fall
out
of
my
head
with
happiness
everything
wonderful
thank
you
a
thousand
times
will
see
you
very
soon
most
marvelous
girl
in
the
world
sends
her
love
so
do
wright
i
suppose
they
expect
us
to
be
surprised
i
said
ostriches
i
always
knew
you
were
a
matchmaker
said
bill
you
certainly
staged
the
whole
thing
well
i
had
her
out
to
amuse
you
not
wright
said
i
with
partial
truth
oh
you
did
did
you
best
laid
plans
did
you
know
that
i
have
had
eyes
or
ears
for
another
woman
since
that
first
night
you
insulted
me
jumpy
said
i
in
delighted
recollection
if
it
were
that
i
have
to
drive
the
car
said
bill
perhaps
later
you
could
stop
i
suggested
he
stopped
in
the
midst
of
the
still
considerable
traffic
and
then
we
sped
on
again
leaving
a
breathless
policeman
struck
into
stone
behind
us
boston
said
i
to
bill
after
we
had
been
there
for
two
hours
is
the
darnedest
place
what
the
matter
with
it
cradle
of
american
culture
and
everythin
reminds
me
of
havana
i
said
havana
you
insane
bill
laid
his
fork
down
and
gazed
at
me
in
amazement
over
the
table
in
the
copley
plaza
because
it
so
different
i
said
but
the
streets
are
much
wider
so
there
and
after
all
i
think
i
could
fall
in
love
with
the
common
and
even
back
bay
there
something
very
solid
about
it
all
as
we
left
the
city
and
went
on
through
the
lovely
massachusetts
country
i
became
more
and
more
enamoured
of
my
own
unknown
new
england
and
bill
delightful
companion
grew
positively
instructive
i
learned
a
little
history
by
the
way
and
we
poked
around
and
explored
in
a
very
leisurely
manner
wellesley
dignified
and
gracious
fascinated
me
we
went
up
to
the
college
and
spent
a
happy
there
with
one
of
the
professors
who
had
been
a
school
friend
of
bill
no
our
mother
but
i
could
help
thinking
of
mercedes
my
bright
tropical
bird
caged
in
a
classroom
filing
to
chapel
with
hundreds
of
other
girls
part
of
a
crowd
i
determined
to
go
some
day
to
vassar
and
see
her
waterloo
for
myself
pride
crossing
filled
me
with
envy
i
liked
the
beautifully
kept
lawns
and
the
wonderful
houses
but
i
fell
so
deeply
in
love
with
gloucester
even
the
fish
that
bill
despaired
of
ever
getting
me
away
wait
till
you
see
salem
he
said
i
probably
have
to
tuck
a
door
in
the
you
want
one
i
know
jolliest
doors
in
the
world
magnolia
salem
plymouth
they
went
by
like
dreams
the
big
hotels
where
we
stayed
the
water
the
spring
skies
the
first
reticent
flowers
and
finally
the
funny
little
cape
towns
hyannis
port
with
its
beaches
and
docks
its
high
sunset
hill
where
we
watched
the
sun
go
down
red
and
purple
over
the
quiet
bay
and
where
we
saw
the
white
sails
of
the
lift
like
wings
against
the
morning
sky
it
was
all
so
lovely
so
new
so
untarnished
for
me
i
even
loved
the
grey
fog
that
swept
in
at
night
like
soft
veils
and
everywhere
serious
or
gay
always
the
perfect
comrade
was
bill
i
would
lie
awake
in
the
mornings
listening
to
him
splash
in
the
shower
or
whistling
to
himself
in
his
room
not
calling
out
good
morning
to
him
for
five
whole
minutes
just
happy
at
having
him
so
near
but
provincetown
we
came
into
it
on
a
wonderful
clear
morning
into
that
sleepy
little
town
girdled
with
sand
on
the
edge
of
the
wide
blue
bay
some
of
the
cottages
were
open
even
as
early
as
it
was
in
the
season
and
the
little
streets
were
bright
with
people
our
inn
was
close
down
on
the
beach
a
rambling
building
built
half
a
century
before
and
beautifully
remodelled
for
modern
purposes
there
were
ships
lanterns
and
clocks
within
a
wide
glassed
verandah
on
which
one
consumed
quantities
of
delicious
food
and
salt
air
a
ship
rope
for
the
banister
of
the
stairway
which
led
steeply
up
to
the
second
floor
beyond
the
landing
was
my
room
with
three
great
windows
fronting
the
bay
one
could
almost
have
flung
a
stone
into
the
water
from
them
the
room
was
in
like
my
own
room
at
home
and
cool
dull
green
chair
cushions
curtains
and
rioted
with
delightfully
impossible
roses
and
the
whole
room
smelled
of
salt
and
sun
and
the
little
lavender
and
bags
i
found
in
and
on
and
my
bath
was
big
and
white
a
tiled
immaculate
room
with
towels
and
washrags
soaps
and
a
dazzling
array
of
bottles
and
how
can
i
clean
my
razor
on
this
demanded
bill
appearing
in
my
room
with
a
little
towel
held
at
arm
length
he
surveyed
the
silken
baskets
of
flowers
designed
upon
it
with
an
air
of
deep
concern
oh
but
you
must
i
said
snatching
it
from
him
in
dismay
oh
but
i
must
he
contradicted
look
at
this
beard
we
left
chatham
so
early
this
morning
that
i
did
get
a
moment
to
shave
i
rubbed
my
cheek
against
the
square
firm
chin
ouch
i
told
you
so
come
with
me
i
said
with
dignity
and
led
him
into
his
own
bathroom
where
i
produced
for
him
certain
small
towels
hanging
under
a
legend
for
your
razor
and
left
him
chuckling
bill
room
was
blue
and
yellow
and
he
complained
that
it
was
far
too
pretty
for
a
man
we
were
still
arguing
about
it
when
we
went
forth
to
survey
the
town
i
popped
in
and
out
of
shops
like
an
agitated
rabbit
according
to
bill
and
bought
armsful
of
bayberry
candles
little
delicate
and
about
six
old
brass
knockers
the
last
named
purchases
moving
bill
to
say
that
he
supposed
we
would
have
to
put
one
on
the
garage
and
another
on
the
the
little
inn
was
deserted
save
for
us
the
maids
an
amiable
and
remarkable
colored
cook
and
the
adorable
little
lady
who
was
our
hostess
she
had
a
tenderness
for
brides
and
grooms
bill
recalled
her
as
having
said
so
on
the
one
occasion
he
had
lunched
with
her
in
provincetown
in
the
dark
ages
before
i
met
you
mavis
and
i
think
she
was
happy
to
have
us
there
at
all
events
she
never
said
so
if
she
was
not
and
we
stayed
for
two
wonderful
weeks
it
was
too
early
for
swimming
of
course
even
for
bill
iron
constitution
but
we
spent
hours
on
the
yellow
sands
watching
the
boats
and
the
sunlight
shifting
over
the
water
once
a
battleship
steamed
in
and
anchored
not
far
away
and
that
evening
there
were
navy
men
in
the
quite
beautiful
in
their
uniforms
very
splendid
to
look
at
under
the
soft
lights
of
the
ships
lanterns
lingering
over
their
coffee
and
cigars
bill
scraped
acquaintance
with
them
of
course
with
the
consequence
that
we
had
tea
one
afternoon
aboard
the
ship
with
the
most
cordial
and
charming
hosts
in
the
world
i
had
not
been
there
half
an
hour
palpitant
with
excitement
before
every
unmarried
officer
present
had
gotten
me
aside
on
one
pretext
or
another
and
shown
me
the
picture
of
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
world
mrs
denton
and
i
will
say
for
the
benedicts
too
that
their
tiny
cabins
were
filled
with
pictures
of
wives
and
babies
it
was
a
very
pleasant
but
bill
hurried
me
home
long
before
i
was
tired
of
deck
and
guns
mascot
a
frisky
goat
named
narcissus
and
the
crowds
of
amusing
in
their
infantile
garb
have
had
you
to
myself
for
a
dog
age
he
growled
what
did
those
men
mean
carrying
you
off
like
that
with
their
denton
please
come
with
me
or
denton
i
got
something
to
show
you
jackasses
i
thought
them
very
nice
said
i
demurely
especially
that
tall
one
with
all
the
gold
braid
and
the
fascinating
eyes
fascinating
eyes
ye
gods
never
again
young
woman
and
he
hustled
me
out
of
the
ship
boat
across
the
sand
and
into
the
house
lest
as
he
said
the
should
be
standing
with
field
glasses
on
the
deck
waiting
to
wave
to
you
again
when
we
were
in
our
rooms
again
and
i
had
called
him
to
hook
me
up
we
were
dressing
for
dinner
he
came
in
and
fumbling
with
those
clever
surgeon
fingers
at
the
hooks
of
my
frock
swept
me
and
the
frock
suddenly
and
breathlessly
into
his
arms
do
keep
me
waiting
too
long
mavis
he
said
very
low
i
put
my
arms
around
his
neck
and
said
something
in
his
ear
and
after
a
moment
he
kissed
me
very
gently
and
let
me
go
it
was
ten
minutes
before
i
realized
that
he
had
gone
without
completing
his
task
of
lady
maid
that
night
a
full
moon
rose
golden
and
glamorous
over
the
bay
bill
and
i
walked
out
on
the
sands
quite
late
i
had
on
a
wooly
white
coat
over
my
thin
dress
and
had
changed
to
more
sensible
shoes
after
all
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
dozen
cubas
the
keen
salt
air
and
the
dear
home
country
just
stirring
under
the
breath
of
spring
happy
asked
bill
as
we
sat
down
on
some
driftwood
logs
and
watched
the
golden
wake
of
the
i
leaned
my
head
against
his
shoulder
and
nodded
you
never
looked
so
beautiful
he
said
as
tonight
i
drew
his
tall
head
down
to
mine
do
you
think
so
i
whispered
and
then
very
softly
i
love
you
my
husband
together
in
the
full
glory
of
the
moonlight
we
walked
in
silence
back
to
the
house
the
lights
gleamed
above
in
my
rose
and
green
bedroom
and
the
door
was
open

well

this
month

been

and
the
poor
villagers
of

are
mightily
embarrassed
at

long
without
knowing

confused

well
