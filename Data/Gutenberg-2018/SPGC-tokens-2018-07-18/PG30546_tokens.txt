preface
the
title
of
this
series
makers
of
canada
seemed
to
impose
on
the
writer
the
obligation
to
devote
special
attention
to
the
part
played
by
george
brown
in
fashioning
the
institutions
of
this
country
from
this
point
of
view
the
most
fruitful
years
of
his
life
were
spent
between
the
time
when
the
was
established
to
advocate
responsible
government
and
the
time
when
the
provinces
were
confederated
and
the
bounds
of
canada
extended
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
the
ordinary
political
contests
in
which
brown
and
his
newspaper
engaged
have
received
only
casual
notice
and
the
effort
of
the
writer
has
been
to
trace
brown
connection
with
the
stream
of
events
by
which
the
old
legislative
union
of
canada
gave
place
to
the
confederated
dominion
after
the
establishment
of
responsible
government
the
course
of
this
stream
is
not
obscure
brown
is
found
complaining
that
upper
canada
is
inadequately
represented
and
is
dominated
by
its
partner
various
remedies
such
as
dissolution
of
the
union
representation
by
population
and
the
double
majority
are
proposed
but
ultimately
the
solution
is
found
in
federation
and
to
this
solution
and
the
events
leading
up
to
it
a
large
part
of
the
book
is
devoted
brown
was
also
an
ardent
advocate
of
the
union
with
canada
of
the
country
lying
west
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
to
this
work
reference
is
made
brown
was
one
of
those
men
who
arouse
strong
friendships
and
strong
animosities
these
have
been
dealt
with
only
where
they
seemed
to
have
a
bearing
upon
history
as
in
the
case
of
sir
john
macdonald
and
of
the
roman
catholic
church
it
seems
to
be
a
profitless
task
for
a
biographer
to
take
up
and
fight
over
again
quarrels
which
had
no
public
importance
and
did
not
affect
the
course
of
history
the
period
covering
brown
career
was
one
in
which
the
political
game
was
played
roughly
and
in
which
strong
feelings
were
aroused
to
this
day
it
is
difficult
to
discuss
the
career
of
the
hon
george
brown
or
of
sir
john
macdonald
without
reviving
these
feelings
in
the
breasts
of
political
veterans
and
their
sons
and
even
one
who
tries
to
study
the
time
and
the
men
and
to
write
their
story
finds
himself
taking
sides
with
men
who
are
in
their
graves
and
fighting
for
causes
long
since
lost
and
won
the
writer
has
tried
to
resist
the
temptation
of
building
up
the
fame
of
brown
by
detracting
from
that
of
other
men
but
he
has
also
thought
it
right
in
many
cases
to
present
brown
point
of
view
not
necessarily
as
the
whole
truth
but
as
one
of
the
aspects
of
truth
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
confederation
my
endeavour
has
been
simply
to
tell
the
story
of
brown
work
and
let
it
speak
for
itself
not
to
measure
the
exact
proportion
of
credit
due
to
brown
and
to
others
it
is
hard
to
believe
however
that
the
verdict
of
history
will
assign
to
him
a
place
other
than
first
among
the
public
men
of
canada
who
contributed
to
the
work
of
confederation
events
as
mcgee
said
were
probably
more
powerful
than
any
of
them
if
any
apology
is
needed
for
the
space
devoted
to
the
subject
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
it
may
be
found
not
only
in
opposition
to
slavery
but
in
the
fact
that
the
civil
war
influenced
the
relations
between
the
united
states
and
canada
and
indirectly
promoted
the
confederation
of
the
canadian
provinces
and
also
in
the
fact
so
frequently
emphasized
by
brown
that
the
growth
of
the
institution
of
slavery
on
this
continent
was
a
danger
to
which
canada
could
not
be
indifferent

george
brown
was
born
at
alloa
a
seaport
on
the
tidal
forth
miles
inward
from
edinburgh
on
november
his
mother
was
a
daughter
of
george
mackenzie
of
stornoway
in
the
island
of
lewis
his
father
peter
brown
was
a
merchant
and
builder
george
was
educated
at
the
high
school
and
southern
academy
in
edinburgh
this
young
man
said
gunn
of
the
southern
academy
is
not
only
endowed
with
high
enthusiasm
but
possesses
the
faculty
of
creating
enthusiasm
in
others
at
the
risk
of
attaching
too
much
significance
to
praise
bestowed
on
a
it
may
be
said
that
these
words
struck
the
keynote
of
brown
character
and
revealed
the
source
of
his
power
the
atmosphere
of
the
household
was
liberal
father
and
son
alike
hated
the
institution
of
slavery
with
which
they
were
destined
to
become
more
closely
acquainted
when
i
was
a
very
young
man
said
george
brown
denouncing
the
fugitive
slave
law
before
a
toronto
audience
i
used
to
think
that
if
i
ever
had
to
speak
before
such
an
audience
as
this
i
would
choose
african
slavery
as
my
theme
in
preference
to
any
other
topic
the
subject
seemed
to
afford
the
widest
scope
for
rhetoric
and
for
fervid
appeals
to
the
best
of
human
sympathies
these
thoughts
arose
far
from
here
while
slavery
was
a
thing
at
a
distance
while
the
horrors
of
the
system
were
unrealized
while
the
mind
received
it
as
a
tale
and
discussed
it
as
a
principle
but
when
you
have
mingled
with
the
thing
itself
when
you
have
encountered
the
atrocities
of
the
system
when
you
have
seen
three
millions
of
human
beings
held
as
chattels
by
their
christian
countrymen
when
you
have
seen
the
free
institutions
the
free
press
and
the
free
pulpit
of
america
linked
in
the
unrighteous
task
of
upholding
the
traffic
when
you
have
realized
the
manacle
and
the
lash
and
the
you
think
no
more
of
rhetoric
the
mind
stands
appalled
at
the
monstrous
iniquity
mere
words
lose
their
meaning
and
facts
cold
facts
are
felt
to
be
the
only
fit
arguments
again
as
george
grew
to
manhood
the
struggle
which
ended
in
the
disruption
of
the
church
of
scotland
was
approaching
its
climax
and
the
sympathies
of
the
brown
household
were
with
those
who
declared
that
it
is
the
fundamental
law
of
this
church
that
no
pastor
shall
be
intruded
on
any
congregation
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
people
in
reverses
in
business
led
the
father
and
son
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
america
arriving
in
new
york
peter
brown
turned
to
journalism
finding
employment
as
a
contributor
to
the
a
weekly
newspaper
published
for
british
residents
of
the
united
states
the
browns
formed
an
unfavourable
opinion
of
american
institutions
as
represented
by
new
york
in
that
day
to
them
the
republic
presented
itself
as
a
power
seeking
to
extend
its
territory
in
order
to
enlarge
the
area
of
slavery
and
hostile
to
great
britain
as
a
citadel
of
freedom
they
always
regarded
the
element
in
the
united
states
as
that
which
kept
up
the
tradition
of
enmity
to
england
an
american
book
entitled
glory
and
shame
of
aroused
peter
brown
indignation
and
he
published
a
reply
in
a
little
volume
bearing
the
name
of
fame
and
glory
of
england
here
he
paid
tribute
to
british
freedom
contrasted
it
with
the
domination
of
the
slave
holders
and
instanced
the
fact
that
in
connecticut
a
woman
had
been
mobbed
and
imprisoned
for
teaching
coloured
girls
to
read
further
light
is
thrown
upon
the
american
experience
of
the
browns
by
an
article
in
the
their
first
canadian
venture
in
journalism
the
writer
is
answering
an
accusation
of
disloyalty
and
yankee
sympathies
a
stock
charge
against
reformers
in
that
day
he
said
we
have
stood
in
the
very
heart
of
a
republic
and
fearlessly
issued
our
weekly
sheet
expressing
our
fervent
admiration
of
the
limited
monarchy
of
great
britain
though
surrounded
by
democratic
whigs
democratic
republicans
irish
repealers
and
every
class
which
breathes
the
most
inveterate
hostility
to
british
institutions
and
we
are
not
to
be
turned
from
maintaining
the
genuine
principles
of
the
constitution
because
some
of
our
contemporaries
are
taken
with
a
fit
of
sycophancy
and
would
sacrifice
all
at
the
shrine
of
power
in
december
the
browns
established
in
new
york
the
a
paper
similar
to
the
but
apparently
designed
more
especially
for
scottish
and
presbyterian
readers
in
the
united
states
and
canada
in
an
effort
to
promote
canadian
circulation
george
brown
came
to
canada
early
in
the
had
taken
strong
ground
on
the
popular
side
of
the
movement
then
agitating
the
church
of
scotland
and
this
struggle
was
watched
with
peculiar
interest
in
canada
where
the
relations
between
church
and
state
were
burning
questions
young
brown
also
met
the
members
of
a
reform
administration
then
holding
power
under
governor
metcalfe
and
the
ministers
became
impressed
with
the
idea
that
he
would
be
a
powerful
ally
in
the
struggle
then
impending
there
is
on
record
an
interesting
pen
picture
of
george
brown
as
he
appeared
at
this
time
the
writer
is
samuel
thompson
editor
of
the
it
was
i
think
somewhere
about
the
month
of
may
that
there
walked
into
my
office
on
nelson
street
a
young
man
of
years
tall
somewhat
and
emphatically
scottish
who
introduced
himself
to
me
as
the
travelling
agent
of
the
new
york
published
by
his
father
this
was
george
brown
afterwards
editor
and
publisher
of
the
newspaper
he
was
a
very
courteous
gentlemanly
young
fellow
and
impressed
me
favourably
his
father
he
said
found
the
political
atmosphere
of
new
york
hostile
to
everything
british
and
that
it
was
as
much
as
a
man
life
was
worth
to
give
expression
to
any
british
predilections
whatsoever
which
i
knew
to
be
true
they
had
therefore
thought
of
transferring
their
publication
to
toronto
and
intended
to
continue
it
as
a
thoroughly
conservative
journal
i
of
course
welcomed
him
as
a
in
the
same
cause
with
ourselves
little
expecting
how
his
ideas
of
conservatism
were
to
develop
themselves
in
subsequent
years
his
conservatism
assuming
that
the
young
man
was
not
misunderstood
was
perhaps
the
result
of
a
reaction
from
the
experience
of
new
york
in
which
democracy
had
presented
itself
in
an
unlovely
aspect
contact
with
toronto
toryism
of
that
day
would
naturally
stiffen
the
liberalism
of
a
combative
man
as
a
result
of
george
brown
survey
of
the
canadian
field
the
publication
of
the
in
new
york
ceased
and
the
browns
removed
to
toronto
where
they
established
the
a
weekly
paper
partly
presbyterian
and
partly
political
and
in
both
fields
championing
the
cause
of
government
by
the
people
the
first
number
was
issued
on
august
referring
to
the
disruption
of
the
scottish
church
that
had
occurred
three
months
before
the
said
if
we
look
to
scotland
we
shall
find
an
event
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
the
world
nearly
five
hundred
ministers
backed
by
several
thousand
elders
and
perhaps
a
million
of
people
have
left
the
church
of
their
fathers
because
the
civil
courts
have
trampled
on
what
they
deem
the
rights
of
the
christian
people
in
scotland
exhibiting
a
lesson
to
the
world
which
must
produce
results
that
can
not
yet
be
measured
the
sacrifice
made
by
these
devoted
ministers
of
the
gospel
is
great
their
reward
is
sure
the
columns
of
the
illustrate
in
a
striking
way
the
intermingling
common
in
that
day
of
religion
and
politics
the
chief
antagonist
was
the
a
paper
equally
devoted
to
episcopacy
and
monarchy
here
is
a
specimen
bit
of
controversy
the
arguing
against
responsible
government
declares
that
as
god
is
the
only
ruler
of
princes
princes
can
not
be
accountable
to
the
people
and
perdition
is
the
lot
of
all
rebels
agitators
of
sedition
demagogues
who
work
under
the
pretence
of
reforming
the
state
all
the
troubles
of
the
country
are
due
to
parliaments
constantly
demanding
more
power
and
thereby
endangering
the
supremacy
of
the
mother
country
the
is
astonished
by
the
unblushing
avowal
of
these
doctrines
which
had
not
been
so
openly
proclaimed
since
the
days
of
high
church
and
sacheverell
and
which
if
acted
upon
would
reduce
the
people
to
the
level
of
abject
slaves
whence
it
asks
comes
this
doctrine
of
the
irresponsibility
of
kings
it
has
been
dug
up
from
the
tombs
of
roman
catholic
and
high
church
priests
and
of
jacobite
bigots
wherever
it
gets
a
footing
it
carries
bloodshed
and
persecution
in
its
train
it
cramps
the
freedom
of
thought
it
represses
commercial
enterprise
and
industry
it
dries
up
the
springs
of
the
human
understanding
to
what
does
britain
owe
all
her
greatness
but
to
that
free
range
of
intellectual
exertion
which
prompted
watt
and
arkwright
in
their
wonderful
discoveries
which
carried
anson
and
cook
round
the
globe
and
which
enabled
newton
to
scale
the
heavens
is
the
dial
to
be
put
back
must
the
world
once
more
adopt
the
doctrine
that
the
people
are
made
for
kings
and
not
kings
for
the
people
where
will
this
treason
to
the
british
constitution
find
the
slightest
warrant
in
the
word
of
god
we
know
that
power
alone
proceeds
from
god
the
very
air
we
breathe
is
the
gift
of
his
bounty
and
whatever
public
right
is
exercised
from
the
most
obscure
elective
franchise
to
the
king
upon
his
throne
is
derived
from
him
to
whom
we
must
account
for
the
exercise
of
it
but
does
that
accountability
take
away
or
lessen
the
political
obligations
of
the
social
compact
assuredly
not
this
style
of
controversy
was
typical
of
the
time
tories
drew
from
the
french
revolution
warnings
against
the
heedless
march
of
democracy
reformers
based
arguments
on
the
glorious
revolution
of
a
bill
for
the
secularization
of
king
college
was
denounced
by
bishop
strachan
the
stalwart
leader
of
the
anglicans
in
language
of
extraordinary
vehemence
the
bill
would
hold
up
the
christian
religion
to
the
contempt
of
wicked
men
and
overturn
the
social
order
by
unsettling
property
placing
all
forms
of
error
on
an
equality
with
truth
the
bill
represented
a
principle
atheistical
and
monstrous
destructive
of
all
that
was
pure
and
holy
in
morals
and
religion
to
find
parallels
for
this
madness
the
bishop
referred
to
the
french
revolution
when
the
christian
faith
was
abjured
and
the
goddess
of
reason
set
up
for
worship
to
pagan
rome

to
please
the
natives
she
had
conquered
condescended
to
associate
their
impure
idolatries
with
her
own
these
writings
are
quoted
not
merely
as
illustrations
of
extravagance
of
language
the
language
was
the
natural
outcome
of
an
extraordinary
situation
the
bishop
was
not
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
he
was
a
power
in
politics
as
well
as
in
the
church
and
had
as
executive
councillor
taken
an
important
part
in
the
government
of
the
country
he
was
not
making
extravagant
pretensions
but
defending
a
position
actually
held
by
his
church
a
position
which
fell
little
short
of
absolute
domination
religious
equality
was
to
be
established
a
great
endowment
of
land
converted
from
sectarian
to
public
purposes
and
a
system
of
education
created
in
this
work
brown
played
a
leading
part
but
before
it
could
be
undertaken
it
was
necessary
to
vindicate
the
right
of
the
people
to
in
november
the
resignation
of
metcalfe
ministers
created
a
crisis
which
soon
absorbed
the
energy
of
the
browns
and
eventually
led
to
the
establishment
of
the
in
the
issue
of
december
the
principles
of
responsible
government
are
explained
and
the
gives
its
support
to
the
ministers
it
can
not
see
why
less
confidence
should
be
bestowed
by
a
in
canada
than
by
a
sovereign
in
the
british
empire
it
deplores
the
rupture
and
declares
that
it
still
belongs
to
no
political
party
it
has
no
liking
for
democracy
a
word
which
even
liberals
at
that
time
seemed
to
regard
with
horror
it
asks
presbyterians
to
stand
fast
for
the
enjoyment
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
it
exhorts
the
people
of
canada
to
be
firm
and
patient
and
to
let
no
feeling
of
disappointment
lead
their
minds
to
republicanism
those
who
would
restrict
the
liberties
of
canada
also
dwell
on
the
evils
of
republicanism
but
they
are
the
very
people
who
would
bring
it
to
pass
the
ideal
is
a
system
of
just
and
equal
government
if
this
is
pursued
a
vast
nation
will
grow
up
speaking
the
same
language
having
the
same
laws
and
customs
and
bound
to
the
mother
country
by
the
strongest
bonds
of
affection
the
which
had
at
first
described
itself
as
independent
in
party
politics
soon
found
itself
drawn
into
a
struggle
which
was
too
fierce
and
too
momentous
to
allow
men
of
strong
convictions
to
remain
neutral
we
find
politics
occupying
more
and
more
attention
in
its
columns
and
finally
on
march
the
is
established
as
the
avowed
ally
of
baldwin
and
lafontaine
and
the
advocate
of
responsible
government
it
will
be
necessary
to
explain
now
the
nature
of
the
difference
between
metcalfe
and
his
ministers
chapter
ii
metcalfe
and
the
reformers
the
browns
arrived
in
canada
in
the
period
of
reconstruction
following
the
rebellion
of
in
lord
durham
report
the
rising
in
lower
canada
was
attributed
mainly
to
racial
animosity
two
nations
warring
in
the
bosom
of
a
single
state
a
struggle
not
of
principles
but
of
races
the
rising
in
upper
canada
was
attributed
mainly
to
the
ascendency
of
the
family
compact
a
family
only
in
the
official
sense
the
bench
the
magistracy
the
high
offices
of
the
episcopal
church
and
a
great
part
of
the
legal
profession
are
filled
by
their
adherents
by
grant
or
purchase
they
have
acquired
nearly
the
whole
of
the
waste
lands
of
the
province
they
are
in
the
chartered
banks
and
till
lately
shared
among
themselves
almost
exclusively
all
offices
of
trust
and
profit
the
bulk
of
this
party
consists
for
the
most
part
of
native
born
inhabitants
of
the
colony
or
of
emigrants
who
settled
in
it
before
the
last
war
with
the
united
states
the
principal
members
of
it
belong
to
the
church
of
england
and
the
maintenance
of
the
claims
of
that
church
has
always
been
one
of
its
distinguishing
characteristics
reformers
discovered
that
even
when
they
triumphed
at
the
polls
they
could
not
break
up
this
combination
the
executive
government
remaining
constantly
in
the
hands
of
their
opponents
they
therefore
agitated
for
the
responsibility
of
the
executive
council
to
the
legislative
assembly
lord
durham
remedy
was
to
unite
upper
and
lower
canada
and
to
grant
the
demand
for
responsible
government
he
hoped
that
the
union
would
in
time
dispose
of
the
racial
difficulty
estimating
the
population
of
upper
canada
at
four
hundred
thousand
the
english
inhabitants
of
lower
canada
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
the
french
at
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
union
of
the
two
provinces
would
not
only
give
a
clear
english
majority
but
one
which
would
be
increased
every
year
by
the
influence
of
english
immigration
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
the
french
when
once
placed
by
the
legitimate
course
of
events
and
the
working
of
natural
causes
in
a
minority
would
abandon
their
vain
hopes
of
nationality
the
future
mapped
out
by
lord
durham
for
the
was
one
of
benevolent
assimilation
he
their
tenacity
and
their
power
of
adapting
themselves
to
new
political
conditions
they
not
only
retained
their
distinctive
language
and
customs
but
gained
so
large
a
measure
of
political
power
that
in
time
upper
canada
complained
that
it
was
dominated
by
its
partner
the
union
was
effected
soon
after
the
report
but
the
granting
of
responsible
government
was
long
delayed
from
the
submission
of
lord
report
to
the
time
of
lord
elgin
the
question
of
responsible
government
was
the
chief
issue
in
canadian
politics
lord
recommendations
were
clear
and
specific
he
maintained
that
harmony
would
be
restored
not
by
weakening
but
strengthening
the
influence
of
the
people
on
its
government
by
confining
within
much
narrower
bounds
than
those
hitherto
allotted
to
it
and
not
by
extending
the
interference
of
the
imperial
authorities
on
the
details
of
colonial
affairs
the
government
must
be
administered
on
the
principles
that
had
been
found
efficacious
in
great
britain
he
would
not
impair
a
single
prerogative
of
the
crown
but
the
crown
must
submit
to
the
necessary
consequences
of
representative
institutions
and
must
govern
through
those
in
whom
the
representative
body
had
confidence
these
principles
are
now
so
well
established
that
it
is
hard
to
realize
how
bold
and
radical
they
appeared
in
between
that
time
and
the
british
government
sent
out
to
canada
three
governors
with
various
instructions
whatever
the
wording
of
these
instructions
was
they
always
fell
short
of
durham
recommendations
and
always
expressed
a
certain
reluctance
to
entrusting
the
government
of
canada
unreservedly
to
representatives
of
the
people
from
to
the
government
in
great
britain
was
that
of
sir
robert
peel
and
it
was
that
government
which
set
itself
most
strongly
against
the
granting
of
autonomy
to
canada
it
was
conservative
and
it
probably
received
from
correspondents
in
canada
a
good
deal
of
misinformation
and
prejudiced
opinion
in
regard
to
the
aims
of
the
reformers
but
it
was
a
group
of
men
of
the
highest
character
and
capacity
concerning
whom
gladstone
has
left
on
record
a
remarkable
testimony
it
is
his
conviction
that
in
many
of
the
most
important
rules
of
public
policy
that
government
surpassed
generally
the
governments
which
have
succeeded
it
whether
liberal
or
conservative
among
them
he
would
mention
purity
in
patronage
financial
strictness
loyal
adherence
to
the
principle
of
public
economy
jealous
regard
to
the
rights
of
parliament
a
single
eye
to
the
public
interest
strong
aversion
to
extension
of
territorial
responsibilities
and
a
frank
admission
of
the
rights
of
foreign
countries
as
equal
to
those
of
their
own
with
this
high
estimate
of
the
general
character
of
the
peel
government
must
be
coupled
the
undoubted
fact
that
it
entirely
misunderstood
the
situation
in
canada
gave
its
support
to
the
party
of
reaction
and
needlessly
delayed
the
establishment
of
we
may
attribute
this
in
part
to
the
distrust
occasioned
by
the
rebellion
in
part
to
the
use
of
partisan
channels
of
information
but
under
all
this
was
a
deeper
cause
inability
to
conceive
of
such
a
relation
as
exists
between
great
britain
and
canada
in
that
respect
peel
and
his
colleagues
resembled
most
of
the
public
men
of
their
time
they
could
understand
separation
they
could
understand
a
relation
in
which
the
british
government
and
its
agents
ruled
the
colonies
in
a
kindly
and
paternal
fashion
but
a
union
under
which
the
colonies
were
nations
in
all
but
foreign
relations
passed
their
comprehension
when
the
colonies
asked
for
complete
it
was
supposed
that
separation
was
really
desired
some
were
for
letting
them
go
in
peace
others
were
for
holding
them
by
political
and
commercial
bonds
of
the
latter
class
stanley
colonial
secretary
under
peel
was
a
good
type
he
believed
in
strong
governors
he
believed
in
a
system
of
preferential
trade
between
great
britain
and
the
colonies
and
his
language
might
have
been
used
with
scarcely
any
modification
by
the
chamberlain
party
in
the
recent
elections
in
great
britain
when
in
he
introduced
the
measure
giving
a
preference
to
canadian
wheat
he
expressed
the
hope
that
it
would
restore
content
and
prosperity
to
canada
and
when
that
preference
disappeared
with
the
corn
laws
he
declared
that
the
basis
of
colonial
union
was
destroyed
from
the
union
to
september
no
name
appears
in
a
canadian
government
were
deeply
dissatisfied
with
the
terms
of
the
union
there
was
a
strong
reluctance
to
admitting
them
to
any
share
of
power
and
they
complained
bitterly
that
they
were
politically
ostracized
by
sydenham
the
first
governor
his
successor
bagot
adopted
the
opposite
policy
and
earned
the
severe
censure
of
the
government
at
home
on
august
sir
robert
peel
wrote
to
lord
stanley
in
terms
which
indicated
a
belief
that
governor
bagot
was
experiencing
great
difficulty
in
carrying
on
the
government
he
spoke
of
a
danger
of
and
radicals
or
and
conservatives
combining
to
place
the
government
in
a
minority
he
suggested
various
means
of
meeting
the
danger
and
said
i
would
not
voluntarily
throw
myself
into
the
hands
of
the
french
party
through
fear
of
being
in
a
minority
before
instructions
founded
on
this
letter
could
reach
the
colony
the
governor
had
acted
throwing
himself
in
the
words
of
biographer
into
the
hands
of
the
party
tainted
by
disaffection
what
had
really
happened
was
that
on
september
the
canadian
government
had
been
reconstructed
the
principal
change
being
the
introduction
of
lafontaine
and
baldwin
as
its
leading
members
this
action
aroused
a
storm
in
canada
where
bagot
was
fiercely
assailed
by
the
tories
for
his
surrender
to
rebels
and
that
view
was
taken
also
in
england
on
october
arbuthnot
wrote
to
sir
robert
peel
the
duke
wellington
has
been
thunderstruck
by
the
news
from
canada
between
ourselves
he
considers
what
has
happened
as
likely
to
be
fatal
to
the
connection
with
england
and
i
must
also
in
the
very
strictest
confidence
tell
you
that
he
dreads
lest
it
should
break
up
the
cabinet
here
at
home
on
october
sir
robert
peel
wrote
to
lord
stanley
pointing
out
the
danger
of
the
duke
strong
and
decisive
condemnation
in
various
quarters
the
duke
of
wellington
denouncing
the
arrangement
as
a
tame
surrender
to
a
party
tainted
with
treason
would
produce
an
impression
most
dangerous
to
the
government
if
it
could
get
over
the
effects
produced
by
the
first
announcement
of
his
retirement
on
the
ground
of
avowed
difference
of
opinion
after
reading
sir
charles
explanations
he
admitted
that
the
governor
position
was
embarrassing
suppose
he
said
in
a
subsequent
letter
that
sir
bagot
was
reduced
to
such
difficulties
that
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
take
the
best
men
of
the
party
into
his
councils
and
that
it
was
better
for
him
to
do
this
before
there
was
a
hostile
vote
still
the
manner
in
which
he
conducted
his
negotiations
was
a
most
unwise
one
he
makes
it
appear
to
the
world
that
he
courted
and
rejoiced
in
the
necessity
for
a
change
in
his
councils
on
october
the
duke
of
wellington
wrote
expressing
his
agreement
with
peel
and
adding
however
it
appears
to
me
that
we
must
consider
the
arrangement
as
settled
and
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
canada
it
will
remain
to
be
considered
afterwards
what
is
to
be
done
with
sir
charles
bagot
and
with
his
measures
the
question
was
solved
by
the
death
of
the
governor
who
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
arouse
the
storm
and
to
create
a
ministerial
crisis
in
great
britain
it
is
believed
that
his
end
was
hastened
by
the
news
from
england
he
fell
ill
in
november
grew
steadily
worse
and
at
last
asked
to
be
recalled
a
request
which
was
granted
at
his
last
cabinet
council
he
bade
an
affectionate
farewell
to
his
ministers
and
begged
them
to
defend
his
memory
his
best
vindication
is
found
in
the
failure
of
metcalfe
policy
and
in
the
happy
results
of
the
policy
of
elgin
the
events
connected
with
the
retirement
of
bagot
which
were
not
fully
understood
until
the
publication
of
sir
robert
peel
papers
a
few
years
ago
throw
light
upon
the
reasons
which
determined
the
selection
of
sir
charles
metcalfe
metcalfe
was
asked
by
lord
stanley
whether
he
would
be
able
and
disposed
to
assume
most
honourable
and
at
the
same
time
very
arduous
duties
in
the
public
service
metcalfe
wrote
to
captain
higginson
afterwards
his
private
secretary
i
am
not
sure
that
the
government
of
canada
is
a
manageable
affair
and
unless
i
think
i
can
go
to
good
purpose
i
will
not
go
at
all
sir
francis
hincks
says
all
sir
charles
metcalfe
correspondence
prior
to
his
departure
from
england
is
indicative
of
a
feeling
that
he
was
going
on
a
forlorn
hope
expedition
and
hincks
adds
that
such
language
can
be
explained
only
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
sent
out
for
the
purpose
of
overthrowing
responsible
government
it
is
certainly
established
by
the
peel
correspondence
that
the
british
government
strongly
disapproved
of
sir
charles
bagot
policy
and
selected
sir
charles
metcalfe
as
a
man
who
would
govern
on
radically
different
lines
it
is
perhaps
putting
it
rather
strongly
to
say
that
he
was
intended
to
overthrow
responsible
government
but
he
must
have
come
to
canada
filled
with
distrust
of
the
canadian
ministry
filled
with
the
idea
that
the
demand
for
responsible
government
was
a
cloak
for
seditious
designs
and
ready
to
take
strong
measures
to
preserve
british
connection
in
this
misunderstanding
lay
the
source
of
his
errors
and
misfortunes
in
canada
it
is
not
therefore
necessary
to
enter
minutely
into
the
dispute
which
occasioned
the
rupture
between
metcalfe
and
his
advisers
on
the
surface
it
was
a
dispute
over
patronage
in
reality
baldwin
and
lafontaine
were
fighting
for
autonomy
and
responsible
government
metcalfe
as
he
thought
was
defending
the
unity
of
the
empire
he
was
a
kindly
and
conscientious
man
and
he
held
his
position
with
some
skill
always
contending
that
he
was
willing
to
agree
to
responsible
government
on
condition
that
the
colonial
position
was
recognized
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
upheld
and
the
governor
not
dominated
by
one
political
party
the
governor
finally
broke
with
his
advisers
in
november
for
some
months
he
was
to
govern
not
only
without
a
responsible
ministry
but
without
a
parliament
for
the
legislature
was
immediately
prorogued
and
did
not
meet
again
before
dissolution
his
chief
adviser
was
william
henry
draper
a
distinguished
lawyer
whose
political
career
was
sacrificed
in
the
attempt
to
hold
an
impossible
position
reformers
and
tories
prepared
for
a
struggle
which
was
to
continue
for
several
years
and
which
in
spite
of
the
smallness
of
the
field
was
of
the
highest
importance
in
settling
a
leading
principle
of
government
on
march
as
a
direct
consequence
of
the
struggle
appeared
the
first
issue
of
the
toronto
its
motto
taken
from
one
of
the
boldest
letters
of
junius
to
george
iii
the
subject
who
is
truly
loyal
to
the
chief
magistrate
will
neither
advise
nor
submit
to
arbitrary
measures
the
leading
article
was
a
long
and
careful
review
of
the
history
of
the
country
followed
by
a
eulogy
on
the
constitution
enjoyed
by
great
britain
since
the
glorious
revolution
of
but
denied
to
canada
responsible
government
was
withheld
the
governor
named
his
councillors
in
defiance
of
the
will
of
the
legislature
advocates
of
responsible
government
were
stigmatized
by
the
governor
friends
as
rebels
traitors
radicals

the

of

of

yet
devised
by
the
wisdom
of

convinced
that
the
prosperity

which
will
tend
to
draw
closer
the
bonds
of
a
mutually
advantageous
union
on
march
the
campaign
was
opened
with
a
meeting
called
by
the
toronto
reform
association
robert
baldwin
father
of
responsible
government
was
in
the
chair
and
william
hume
blake
was
the
orator
of
the
night
the
young
editor
of
the
a
recruit
among
veterans
seems
to
have
made
a
hit
with
a
picture
of
a
ministry
framed
on
the
no
party
plan
advocated
by
governor
metcalfe
in
this
imaginary
ministry
he
grouped
at
the
same
council
table
robert
baldwin
and
his
colleague
francis
hincks
sir
allan
macnab
the
tory
leader
william
henry
draper
metcalfe
chief
adviser
john
strachan
bishop
of
toronto
and
ryerson
leader
of
the
methodists
and
champion
of
the
governor
his
excellency
is
on
a
chair
raised
above
the
warring
elements
below
baldwin
moves
that
king
college
be
opened
to
all
classes
of
her
majesty
subjects
at
once
the
combination
is
dissolved
as
any
one
who
remembers
bishop
strachan
views
on
that
question
will
understand
ryerson
whose
name
was
used
by
brown
in
this
illustration
was
a
leader
among
the
methodists
and
had
fought
stoutly
for
religious
equality
against
anglican
privilege
but
he
had
espoused
the
side
of
the
apparently
taking
seriously
the
position
that
it
was
the
only
course
open
to
a
loyal
subject
in
a
series
of
letters
published
in
the
summer
of
he
warned
the
people
that
the
toronto
reform
association
was
leading
them
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
in
the
same
manner
he
said
i
warned
you
against
the
constitutional
reform
association
formed
in
in
my
warning
predictions
were
realized
to
the
ruin
of
many
and
the
misery
of
thousands
what
took
place
in
was
but
a
preface
of
what
may
be
witnessed
in
the
warning
he
meant
to
convey
was
that
the
people
were
being
drawn
into
a
conflict
with
the
imperial
authorities
baldwin
he
said
practically
renounces
the
imperial
authority
by
refusing
to
appeal
to
it
and
by
appealing
through
the
toronto
association
to
the
people
of
canada
if
the
people
of
canada
are
the
tribunal
of
judgment
on
one
question
of
constitutional
prerogative
they
are
so
on
every
question
of
constitutional
prerogative
then
the
governor
is
no
longer
responsible
to
the
imperial
authority
and
canada
is
an
independent
country
baldwin
proceeding
therefore
not
only
leads
to
independence
but
involves
unconsciously
i
admit
from
extreme
and
theoretical
views
a
practical
declaration
of
independence
before
the
arrival
of
the
of
july
in
this
language
ryerson
described
with
accuracy
the
attitude
of
the
british
government
that
government
had
as
we
have
seen
disapproved
of
governor
bagot
action
in
parting
with
so
large
a
measure
of
power
and
it
was
fully
prepared
to
support
metcalfe
in
pursuing
the
opposite
course
ryerson
was
also
right
in
saying
that
the
government
of
great
britain
would
be
supported
by
parliament
in
may
the
affairs
of
canada
were
discussed
in
the
british
house
of
commons
and
the
governor
action
was
justified
by
peel
by
lord
stanley
and
by
lord
john
russell
the
only
dissentient
voices
were
those
of
the
radicals
hume
and
roebuck
metcalfe
and
his
chiefs
at
home
can
hardly
be
blamed
for
holding
the
prevailing
views
of
the
time
which
were
that
the
changes
contemplated
by
durham
by
bagot
and
by
baldwin
were
dangerous
and
revolutionary
the
idea
that
a
colony
could
remain
connected
with
great
britain
under
such
a
system
of
autonomy
as
we
enjoy
was
then
conceived
by
only
a
few
men
of
exceptional
breadth
and
foresight
among
whom
elgin
was
one
of
the
most
eminent
the
wise
leadership
of
baldwin
and
lafontaine
and
the
patience
and
firmness
of
the
reformers
are
attested
by
their
conduct
in
very
trying
circumstances
finding
their
demand
for
constitutional
reform
opposed
not
only
by
the
canadian
tories
but
by
the
and
the
imperial
government
and
parliament
they
might
have
become
discouraged
or
have
been
tempted
into
some
act
of
violence
their
patience
must
have
been
sorely
tried
by
the
persistent
malice
or
obstinate
prejudice
which
stigmatized
a
strictly
constitutional
movement
as
treason
they
had
also
to
endure
the
trial
of
a
temporary
defeat
at
the
polls
and
an
apparent
rejection
of
their
policy
by
the
very
people
for
whose
liberties
they
were
contending
in
the
autumn
of
the
legislature
was
dissolved
and
a
fierce
contest
ensued
governor
metcalfe
attitude
is
indicated
by
his
biographer
the
contest
he
says
was
between
loyalty
on
the
one
side
and
disaffection
to
her
majesty
government
on
the
other
that
there
was
a
strong
feeling
abroad
in
both
divisions
of
the
province
upper
and
lower
canada
metcalfe
clearly
and
painfully
perceived
the
conviction
served
to
brace
and
stimulate
him
to
new
exertions
he
felt
that
he
was
fighting
for
his
sovereign
against
a
rebellious
people
the
appeal
was
successful
upper
canada
was
swept
by
the
loyalty
cry
and
in
various
polling
places
votes
were
actually
cast
or
offered
for
the
the
described
a
conversation
that
occurred
in
a
polling
place
in
york
whom
do
you
vote
for
i
vote
for
the
there
is
no
such
candidate
say
george
duggan
you
blockhead
oh
yes
george
duggan
it
all
the
same
thing
there
were
candidates
who
described
themselves
as
men
there
were
candidates
whose
royalist
enthusiasm
was
expressed
in
the
name
cavaliers
in
the
montreal
election
petition
it
was
charged
that
during
two
days
of
polling
the
electors
were
exposed
to
danger
from
the
attacks
of
bands
of
fighting
men
hired
by
the
government
candidates
or
their
agents
and
paid
fed
and
armed
with
bludgeons
and
pistols
and
other
murderous
weapons
for
the
purpose
of
intimidating
the
liberal
electors
and
preventing
them
from
gaining
access
to
the
polls
that
liberals
were
driven
from
the
polls
by
these
fighting
men
and
by
cavalry
and
infantry
acting
under
the
orders
of
partisan
magistrates
the
polls
it
was
stated
were
surrounded
by
soldiers
were
placed
in
several
public
squares
and
the
city
was
virtually
in
a
state
of
siege
the
charges
were
not
investigated
the
petition
being
rejected
for
irregularity
but
violence
and
intimidation
were
then
common
accompaniments
of
elections
in
november
the
governor
was
able
to
record
his
victory
thus
upper
canada
avowed
supporters
of
his
government
thirty
avowed
adversaries
seven
undeclared
and
uncertain
five
lower
canada
avowed
supporters
sixteen
avowed
adversaries
undeclared
and
uncertain
four
remarking
on
this
difference
between
upper
and
lower
canada
he
said
that
loyalty
and
british
feeling
prevailed
in
upper
canada
and
in
the
eastern
townships
of
lower
canada
and
that
disaffection
was
predominant
among
the
constituencies
metcalfe
honestly
believed
he
had
saved
canada
for
the
empire
but
more
mischief
could
hardly
have
been
done
by
deliberate
design
in
achieving
a
barren
and
precarious
victory
at
the
polls
he
and
his
friends
had
run
the
risk
of
creating
that
disaffection
which
they
feared
the
stigma
of
disloyalty
had
been
unjustly
affixed
to
honest
and
men
whose
steadiness
alone
prevented
them
in
their
resentment
from
joining
the
ranks
of
the
disaffected
worse
still
the
line
of
political
cleavage
had
been
identified
with
the
line
of
racial
division
and
and
rebel
had
been
used
as
synonymous
terms
the
ministry
and
the
legislative
assembly
were
now
such
as
the
governor
had
desired
yet
the
harmony
was
soon
broken
there
appeared
divisions
in
the
cabinet
hostile
votes
in
the
legislature
and
finally
a
revolt
in
the
conservative
press
an
attempt
to
form
a
coalition
with
the
members
drew
a
sarcastic
comment
from
the
draper
has
invited
the
men
whom
he
and
his
party
have
for
years
stigmatized
before
the
country
as
rebels
and
traitors
and
destructives
to
join
his
administration
reformers
regarded
these
troubles
as
evidence
that
the
experiment
in
reaction
was
failing
and
waited
patiently
for
the
end
shortly
after
the
election
the
governor
was
raised
to
the
peerage
an
honour
which
if
not
earned
by
success
in
canada
was
fairly
due
to
his
honest
intentions
he
left
canada
at
the
close
of
the
year
suffering
from
a
painful
disease
of
which
he
died
a
year
afterwards
soon
after
the
governor
departure
the
young
editor
of
the
had
a
curious
experience
at
a
dinner
of
the
andrew
society
toronto
the
president
judge
maclean
proposed
the
health
of
lord
metcalfe
eulogized
his
canadian
policy
and
insisted
that
he
had
not
been
recalled
as
certain
persons
have
most
impertinently
and
untruly
assumed
and
set
forth
brown
refused
to
drink
the
toast
and
asked
to
be
heard
asserting
that
he
had
been
publicly
insulted
from
the
chair
after
a
scene
of
uproar
he
managed
to
obtain
a
hearing
and
said
addressing
the
chairman
i
understand
your
allusions
sir
and
your
epithet
of
impertinence
as
applied
to
myself
i
throw
it
back
on
you
with
contempt
and
will
content
myself
with
saying
that
your
using
such
language
and
dragging
such
matters
before
the
society
was
highly
improper
lord
metcalfe
sir
has
been
recalled
and
it
may
yet
be
seen
that
it
was
done
by
an
enlightened
british
government
for
cause
the
toast
which
you
have
given
too
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
introduced
are
highly
improper
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
lord
metcalfe
administration
there
is
a
wide
difference
of
opinion
as
to
it
but
i
refrain
from
saying
one
word
as
to
his
conduct
in
this
province
this
is
not
a
political
but
a
benevolent
society
composed
of
persons
of
very
varied
political
sentiments
and
such
a
toast
ought
never
to
have
been
brought
here
lord
metcalfe
is
not
now
of
canada
and
i
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
do
honour
to
him
or
not
as
i
saw
fit
and
that
without
any
disparagement
to
his
conduct
as
a
gentleman
even
though
the
person
who
is
president
of
this
society
thinks
otherwise
this
incident
trivial
as
it
may
appear
illustrates
the
passion
aroused
by
the
contest
and
the
bold
and
resolute
character
of
the
young
politician
lord
metcalfe
successor
was
earl
cathcart
a
soldier
who
concerned
himself
little
in
the
political
disputes
of
the
country
and
who
had
been
chosen
because
of
the
danger
of
war
with
the
united
states
arising
out
of
the
dispute
over
the
oregon
boundary
the
settlement
of
that
dispute
does
not
come
within
the
scope
of
this
work
but
it
may
be
noted
that
the
was
fully
possessed
by
the
belligerent
spirit
of
the
time
and
frankly
expressed
the
hope
that
great
britain
would
fight
not
merely
for
the
oregon
boundary
but
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
black
population
the
writer
hoped
that
the
christian
nations
of
the
world
would
combine
and
break
the
chains
of
the
slaves
in
the
united
states
in
brazil
and
in

it
was
represented
that

waterways
had

of
the
report
made
to

britain
and
that
the
disappointment

resulting

alienation
from

gladstone
in

denied
that
the

was
protection
the
exchange
not

but
of

the
true
basis
lay
in
common
feelings
traditions
and
hopes
the
held
that
canada
had
no
right
to
complain
if
the
people
of
the
united
kingdom
did
what
was
best
for
themselves
england
as
an
exporter
of
manufactures
had
to
meet
competition
at
the
world
prices
and
must
have
cheap
food
supplies
canada
had
surely
a
higher
destiny
than
to
export
a
few
hundred
bushels
of
wheat
and
flour
to
england
canadian
home
manufactures
must
be
encouraged
and

made
to
obtain

with

the

said

out

full
cry
against

their
conduct
affords
an
illustration
of
the
unmitigated
selfishness
of
toryism
give
them
everything
they
can
desire
and
they
are
brimful
of
loyalty
they
will
shout
pæans
till
they

till
they
are
blind
in
favour
of

who

all

and
all

but
let
their

be

and
how
soon
does
their
loyalty
evaporate
nothing
is

talked
of
but
separation
from
the
mother
country
unless
the
mother
continues
feeding
them
in
the
mode
prescribed
by
the
child
some
time
afterwards
lord
elgin
in
his
communications
to
the
home
government
said
that
the
canadian
millers
and
shippers
had
a
substantial
grievance
not
in
the
introduction
of
free
trade
but
in
the
constant
tinkering
incident
to
the
abandoned
system
of
imperial
protection
the
preference
given
in
to
canadian
wheat
and
to
flour
even
when
made
of
american
wheat
had
stimulated
milling
in
canada
but
almost
before
the
mills
were
fairly
at
work
the
free
trade
measure
of
swept
the
advantage
away
what
was
wrong
was
not
free
trade
but
canadian
dependence
on
imperial
tariff
legislation
elgin
was
one
of
the
few
statesmen
of
his
day
who
perceived
that
the
colonies
might
enjoy
commercial
independence
and
political
equality
without
separation
he
declared
that
imperial
unity
did
not
depend
on
the
exercise
of
dominion
the
dispensing
of
patronage
or
the
maintenance
of
an
imperial
for
forcing
commerce
and
manufactures
yet
he
conceived
of
an
empire
not
confined
to
the
british
islands
but
growing
expanding
strengthening
itself
from
age
to
age
and
drawing
new
supplies
of
vitality
from
virgin
soils
with
elgin
administration
began
the
new
era
of
the
legislature
was
dissolved
towards
the
close
of
the
year
and
the
election
resulted
in
a
complete
victory
for
the
reformers
in
upper
canada
the
contest
was
fairly
close
but
in
lower
canada
the
conservative
forces
were
almost
annihilated
and
on
the
first
vote
in
parliament
the
government
was
defeated
by
a
large
majority
the
second
government
received
the
full
confidence
and
loyal
support
of
the
governor
and
by
its
conduct
and
achievements
justified
the
reform
that
had
been
so
long
delayed
and
adopted
with
so
many
misgivings
but
the
fight
for
responsible
government
was
not
yet
finished
the
cry
of
french
and
rebel
domination
was
raised
as
it
had
been
raised
in
the
days
of
governor
bagot
a
toronto
journal
reproachfully
referred
to
lord
elgin
descent
from
the
bruce
and
asked
how
a
man
of
royal
ancestry
could
so
degrade
himself
as
to
consort
with
rebels
and
political
jobbers
surely
the
curse
of
minerva
uttered
by
a
great
poet
against
the
father
clings
to
the
son
the
removal
of
the
old
seemed
to
this
writer
to
be
an
act
of
desecration
not
unlike
the
removal
of
the
famous
marbles
from
the
parthenon
in
a
despatch
explaining
his
course
on
the
rebellion
losses
bill
lord
elgin
said
that
long
before
that
legislation
there
were
evidences
of
the
temper
which
finally
produced
the
explosion
he
quoted
the
following
passage
from
a
newspaper
when
french
tyranny
becomes
insupportable
we
shall
find
our
cromwell
sheffield
in
olden
times
used
to
be
famous
for
its
keen
and
whittles
well
they
make
bayonets
there
now
just
as
sharp
and
just
as
when
we
can
stand
tyranny
no
longer
it
will
be
seen
whether
good
bayonets
in
saxon
hands
will
not
be
more
than
a
match
for
a
mace
and
a
majority
all
the
fuel
for
a
conflagration
was
ready
there
was
race
hatred
there
was
party
hostility
there
was
commercial
depression
and
there
was
a
sincere
though
exaggerated
loyalty
which
regarded
rebellion
as
the
unforgivable
sin
and
which
was
in
constant
dread
of
the
spread
of
radical
republican
and
democratic
ideas
the
rebellion
losses
bill
was
all
that
was
needed
to
fan
the
embers
into
flame
this
was
a
measure
intended
to
compensate
persons
who
had
suffered
losses
during
the
rebellion
in
lower
canada
it
was
attacked
as
a
measure
for
rewarding
rebels
lord
elgin
afterwards
said
that
he
did
not
believe
a
rebel
would
receive
a
farthing
but
even
if
we
suppose
that
some
rebels
or
rebel
sympathizers
were
included
in
the
list
the
outcry
against
the
bill
was
unreasonable
a
general
amnesty
had
been
proclaimed
had
been
admitted
to
a
full
share
of
political
power
the
greater
things
having
been
granted
it
was
mere
pedantry
to
haggle
about
the
less
and
to
hold
an
elaborate
inquiry
into
the
principles
of
every
man
whose
barns
had
been
burned
during
the
rebellion
when
responsible
government
was
conceded
it
was
admitted
that
even
the
rebels
had
not
been
wholly
wrong
it
would
have
been
straining
at
a
gnat
and
swallowing
a
camel
to
say
we
will
give
you
these
free
institutions
for
the
sake
of
which
you
rebelled
but
we
will
not
pay
you
the
small
sum
of
money
necessary
to
recompense
you
for
losses
arising
out
of
the
rebellion
however
it
is
easier
to
discuss
these
matters
coolly
in
than
it
was
in
and
in
the
notion
of
rewarding
the
rebels
produced
another
rebellion
on
a
small
scale
a
large
quantity
of
important
legislation
was
brought
down
by
the
new
government
when
it
met
the
legislature
early
in
but
everything
else
was
forgotten
when
lafontaine
introduced
the
resolution
on
which
the
rebellion
losses
bill
was
founded
in
various
parts
of
upper
canada
meetings
were
held
and
protests
made
against
the
measure
in
toronto
the
protests
took
the
form
of
mob
violence
foreshadowing
what
was
to
come
in
montreal
effigies
of
baldwin
and
blake
were
carried
through
the
streets
and
burned
william
lyon
mackenzie
had
lately
returned
to
canada
and
was
living
at
the
house
of
a
citizen
named
mackintosh
the
mob
went
to
the
house
threatened
to
pull
it
down
and
burned
an
effigy
of
mackenzie
the
windows
of
the
house
were
broken
and
stones
and
bricks
thrown
in
the
office
was
apparently
not
molested
but
about
midnight
the
mob
went
to
the
of
the
browns
battered
at
the
door
and
broke
some
windows
the
in
this
trying
time
stood
staunchly
by
the
government
and
lord
elgin
and
powerfully
influenced
the
public
opinion
of
upper
canada
in
their
favour
addresses
calling
for
the
withdrawal
of
lord
elgin
were
met
by
addresses
supporting
his
action
and
the
signatures
to
the
friendly
addresses
outnumbered
the
other
by
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
george
brown
baldwin
and
howland
were
deputed
to
present
an
address
from
the
reformers
of
upper
canada
sir
william
howland
has
said
that
lord
elgin
was
so
much
affected
that
he
shed
tears
this
is
not
the
place
however
great
the
temptation
may
be
to
describe
the
stirring
scenes
that
were
enacted
in
montreal
the
stormy
debate
the
fiery
speech
in
which
william
hume
blake
hurled
back
at
the
tories
the
charge
of
disloyalty
the
tumult
in
the
galleries
the
burning
of
the
parliament
buildings
and
the
mobbing
and
stoning
of
the
lord
elgin
bearing
under
this
severe
trial
was
admirable
he
was
most
desirous
that
blood
should
not
be
shed
and
for
this
reason
avoided
the
use
of
troops
or
the
proclamation
of
martial
law
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
storm
gradually
subside
a
less
dangerous
evidence
of
discontent
was
a
manifesto
signed
by
leading
citizens
of
montreal
advocating
annexation
to
the
united
states
not
only
to
relieve
commercial
depression
but
to
settle
the
race
question
forever
by
bringing
to
bear
on
the
the
powerful
assimilating
forces
of
the
republic
the
signers
of
this
document
were
leniently
dealt
with
but
those
among
them
who
afterwards
took
a
prominent
part
in
politics
were
not
permitted
to
forget
their
error
elgin
was
of
opinion
that
there
was
ground
for
discontent
on
commercial
grounds
and
he
advocated
the
removal
of
imperial
restriction
on
navigation
and
the
establishment
of
reciprocity
between
the
united
states
and
the
british
north
american
provinces
the
annexation
movement
was
confined
chiefly
to
montreal
in
upper
canada
an
association
called
the
british
american
league
was
formed
and
a
convention
held
at
kingston
in
the
familiar
topics
of
commercial
depression
and
french
domination
were
discussed
some
violent
language
was
used
but
the
remedies
proposed
were
sane
enough
they
were
protection
retrenchment
and
the
union
of
the
british
provinces
union
it
was
said
would
put
an
end
to
french
domination
and
would
give
canada
better
access
to
the
sea
and
increased
commerce
the
british
american
league
figures
in
the
old
and
not
very
profitable
controversy
as
to
the
share
of
credit
to
be
allotted
to
each
political
party
for
the
work
of
confederation
it
is
part
of
the
conservative
case
but
the
platform
was
abandoned
for
the
time
and
confederation
remained
in
the
realm
of
speculation
rather
than
of
action
chapter
iv
dissension
among
reformers
within
the
limits
of
one
parliament
less
than
four
years
the
government
achieved
a
large
amount
of
useful
work
including
the
establishment
of
cheap
and
uniform
postage
the
reforming
of
the
courts
of

the
remodelling
of
the
municipal
system
the

and
the
inauguration
of
a

by
which
the
province
was
covered
with
a
network
of
railways
with
such
a
record
the
government
hardly
seemed
to
be
open
to
a
charge
of
lack
of
energy
and
progressiveness
but
it
was
a
time
when
radicalism
was
in
the
air
it
may
be
more
than
a
coincidence
that
chartism
in
england
and
a
revolution
in
france
were
followed
by
radical
movements
in
both
canadas
the
counterpart
to
the
rouge
party
in

canada
elsewhere
referred
to
was
the
clear

party
in

among
its
leaders

of

of
the
reform
party
in
upper
canada
caleb
hopkins
david
christie
james
lesslie
john
rolph
and
william
macdougall
rolph
had
played
a
leading
part
in
the
movement
for
reform
before
the
rebellion
and
is
the
leading
figure
in
history
of
that
period
macdougall
was
a
young
lawyer
and
journalist
fighting
his
way
into
prominence
grit
afterwards
became
a
nickname
for
a
member
of
the
reform
or
liberal
party
and
especially
for
the
enthusiastic
followers
of
george
brown
yet
in
all
the
history
of
a
quarrelsome
period
in
politics
there
is
no
more
violent
quarrel
than
that
between
brown
and
the
clear
grits
it
is
said
that
brown
and
christie
were
one
day
discussing
the
movement
and
that
brown
had
mentioned
the
name
of
a
leading
reformer
as
one
of
the
opponents
of
the
new
party
christie
replied
that
the
party
did
not
want
such
men
they
wanted
only
those
who
were
clear
grit
this
is
one
of
several
theories
as
to
the
derivation
of
the
name
the
denounced
the
party
as
a
miserable
clique
of
cormorants
who
met
in
a
certain
lawyer
office
on
king
street
macdougall
and
announced
their
intention
to
form
a
new
party
on
clear
grit
principles
the
edited
by
macdougall
denounced
brown
with
equal
fury
as
a
servile
adherent
of
the
baldwin
government
brown
for
several
years
was
in
this
position
of
hostility
to
the
radical
wing
of
the
party
he
was
defeated
in
haldimand
by
william
lyon
mackenzie
who
stood
on
an
advanced
radical
platform
and
in
his
opponent
in
kent
and
lambton
was
malcolm
cameron
a
clear
grit
who
had
joined
the
government
the
nature
of
their
relations
is
shown
by
a
letter
in
which
cameron
called
on
one
of
his
friends
to
come
out
and
oppose
brown
i
will
be
out
and
we
will
show
him
up
and
let
him
know
what
stuff
liberal
reformers
are
made
of
and
how
they
would
treat
fanatical
beasts
who
would
allow
no
one
liberty
but
themselves
the
clear
grits
advocated
the
application
of
the
elective
principle
to
all
the
officials
and
institutions
of
the
country
from

of

the

these
were
practical
questions
on
which
the
reform
party
was
united
but
these
were
placed
on
the
programme
merely
to
cloak
its
revolutionary
features
features
that
simply
meant
the
adoption
of
republican
institutions
and
the
taking
of
the
first
step
towards
annexation
the
british
system
of
responsible
government
was
upheld
by
the
as
far
superior
to
the
american
system
in
the
security
it
afforded
to
life
and
property
but
while
brown
defended
the
government
from
the
attacks
of
the
clear
grits
he
was
himself
growing
impatient
at
their
delay
in
dealing
with
certain
questions
that
he
had
at
heart
especially
the
secularization
of
the
clergy
reserves
he
tried
as
we
should
say
to
reform
the
party
from
within
he
was
attacked
for
his
continued
support
of
a
ministry
accused
of
abandoning
principles
while
he
was
endeavouring
to
influence
the
members
to
a
right
course
without
an
open
rupture
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
discontent
drawing
him
away
from
the
government
in
october
the
contained
a
series
of
articles
on
the
subject
it
was
pointed
out
that
there
were
four
parties
in
the
country
the
tories
the
opponents
of
responsible
government
whose
members
were
fast
diminishing
the
new
party
led
by
john
macdonald
the
ministerialists
and
the
clear
grits
who
were
described
as
composed
of
english
radicals
republicans
and
annexationists
the
ministerialists
had
an
overwhelming
majority
over
all
but
were
disunited
what
was
the
trouble
the
ministers
might
be
a
little
slow
a
little
wanting
in
tact
a
little
less
democratic
than
some
of
their
followers
they
were
not
traitors
to
the
reform
cause
and
intemperate
attacks
on
them
might
be
disastrous
to
that
cause
a
union
of
with
upper
canadian
conservatives
would
it
was
prophesied
make
the
reform
party
powerless
though
in
later
years
george
brown
became
known
as
the
chief
opponent
of
influence
he
was
well
aware
of
the
value
of
the
alliance
and
he
gave
the
full
credit
for
their
support
to
measures
of
reform
let
the
truth
be
known
said
the
at
this
time
to
the
of
lower
canada
are
the
reformers
of
upper
canada
indebted
for
the
sweeping
majorities
which
carried
their
best
measures
he
gave
the
government
credit
for
an
immense
mass
of
useful
legislation
enacted
in
a
very
short
period
but
more
remained
to
be
done
the
clergy
reserves
must
be
abolished
and
all
connection
between
church
and
state
swept
away
the
party
in
power
has
no
policy
before
the
country
no
one
knows
what
measures
are
to
be
brought
forward
by
the
leaders
each
man
fancies
a
policy
for
himself
the
conductors
of
the
public
press
must
take
ground
on
all
the
questions
of
the
day
and
each
accordingly
strikes
out
such
a
line
as
suits
his
own
leanings
the
palates
of
his
readers
or
what
he
deems
for
the
good
of
the
country
all
sorts
of
vague
schemes
are
thus
thrown
on
the
sea
of
public
opinion
to
agitate
the
waters
with
the
triple
result
of
poisoning
the
public
mind
producing
unnecessary
divisions
and
committing
sections
of
the
party
to
views
and
principles
which
they
might
never
have
contemplated
under
a
better
system
for
some
time
the
articles
in
the
did
not
pass
the
bounds
of
friendly
though
outspoken
criticism
the
events
that
drew
brown
into
opposition
were
his
breach
with
the
roman
catholic
church
the
campaign
in
haldimand
in
which
he
was
defeated
by
william
lyon
mackenzie
the
retirement
of
baldwin
and
the
accession
to
power
of
the
administration
towards
the
end
of
there
arrived
in
canada
copies
of
a
pastoral
letter
by
cardinal
wiseman
defending
the
famous
papal
bull
which
divided
england
into
sees
of
the
roman
catholic
church
and
gave
territorial
titles
to
the
bishops
sir
taché
a
member
of
the
government
showed
one
of
these
to
brown
and
jocularly
challenged
him
to
publish
it
in
the
brown
accepted
the
challenge
declaring
that
he
would
also
publish
a
reply
to
be
written
by
himself
the
reply
which
will
be
found
in
the
of
december
is
argumentative
in
tone
and
probably
would
not
of
itself
have
involved
brown
in
a
violent
quarrel
with
the
church
the
following
passage
was
afterwards
cited
by
the
as
defining
its
position
in
offering
a
few
remarks
upon
wiseman
production
we
have
no
intention
to
discuss
the
tenets
of
the
roman
catholic
church
but
merely
to
look
at
the
question
in
its
secular
aspect
as
advocates
of
the
voluntary
principle
we
give
to
every
man
full
liberty
to
worship
as
his
conscience
dictates
and
without
penalty
civil
or
ecclesiastical
attaching
to
his
exercise
thereof
we
would
allow
each
sect
to
give
to
its
pastors
what
titles
it
sees
fit
and
to
prescribe
the
extent
of
spiritual
duties
but
we
would
have
the
state
recognize
no
ecclesiastical
titles
or
boundaries
whatever
the
public
may
from
courtesy
award
what
titles
they
please
but
the
should
recognize
none
the
voluntary
principle
is
the
great
cure
for
such
dissensions
as
now
agitate
great
britain
the
cause
of
conflict
lay
outside
the
bounds
of
that
article
cardinal
wiseman
letter
and
lord
john
russell
reply
had
thrown
england
into
a
ferment
of
religious
excitement
lord
john
russell
says
justin
mccarthy
who
had
more
than
any
man
living
been
identified
with
the
principles
of
religious
liberty
who
had
sat
at
the
feet
of
fox
and
had
for
his
closest
friend
the
poet
thomas
moore
came
to
be
regarded
by
the
roman
catholics
as
the
bitterest
enemy
of
their
creed
and
their
rights
of
worship
it
is
evident
that
this
hatred
of
russell
was
carried
across
the
atlantic
and
that
brown
was
regarded
as
his
ally
in
the
haldimand
election
a
signed
an
irish
roman
catholic
was
circulated
it
assailed
brown
fiercely
for
the
support
he
had
given
to
russell
and
for
the
general
course
of
the
in
regard
to
catholic
questions
russell
was
described
as
attempting
to
twine
again
around
the
writhing
limbs
of
ten
millions
of
catholics
the
chains
that
our
own
rescued
us
from
in
a
vote
for
george
brown
would
help
to
rivet
these
spiritual
chains
round
the
souls
of
irishmen
and
to
crush
the
religion
for
which
ireland
had
wept
oceans
of
blood
those
who
voted
for
brown
would
be
prostrating
themselves
like
cowardly
slaves
or
beasts
of
burden
before
the
avowed
enemies
of
their
country
their
religion
and
their
god
you
will
think
of
the
gibbets
the
triangles
the
the
tortures
the
hangings
of
the
past
you
will
reflect
on
the
struggles
of
the
present
against
the
new
penal
bill
you
will
look
forward
to
the
dangers
the
triumphs
the
hopes
of
the
future
and
then
you
will
go
to
the
polls
and
vote
against
george
brown
this
was
not
the
only
handicap
with
which
brown
entered
on
his
first
election
contest
there
was
no
cordial
sympathy
between
him
and
the
government
yet
he
was
hampered
by
his
connection
with
the
government
the
dissatisfied
radicals
rallied
to
the
support
of
william
lyon
mackenzie
whose
sufferings
in
exile
also
made
a
strong
appeal
to
the
hearts
of
reformers
and
mackenzie
was
elected
in
his
election
address
brown
declared
himself
for
perfect
religious
equality
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
the
diversion
of
the
clergy
reserves
from
denominational
to
educational
purposes
i
am
in
favour
of
national
school
education
free
from
sectarian
teaching
and
available
without
charge
to
every
child
in
the
province
i
desire
to
see
efficient
grammar
schools
established
in
each
county
and
that
the
fees
of
these
institutions
and
of
the
national
university
should
be
placed
on
such
a
scale
as
will
bring
a
high
literary
and
scientific
education
within
the
reach
of
men
of
talent
in
any
rank
of
life
he
advocated
free
trade
in
the
fullest
sense
expressing
the
hope
that
the
revenue
from
public
lands
and
canals
with
strict
economy
would
enable
canada
to
dispense
with
the
whole
customs
department
brown
estrangement
from
the
government
did
not
become
an
open
rupture
so
long
as
baldwin
and
lafontaine
were
at
the
head
of
affairs
in
the
summer
following
brown
defeat
in
haldimand
baldwin
resigned
owing
to
a
resolution
introduced
by
william
lyon
mackenzie
for
the
abolition
of
the
court
of
chancery
the
resolution
was
defeated
but
obtained
the
votes
of
a
majority
of
the
upper
canadian
members
and
baldwin
regarded
their
action
as
an
indication
of
want
of
confidence
in
himself
he
dropped
some
expressions
too
which
indicated
that
he
was
moved
by
larger
considerations
he
was
conservative
in
his
views
and
he
regarded
the
mackenzie
vote
as
a
sign
of
a
flood
of
radicalism
which
he
felt
powerless
to
stay
shortly
afterwards
lafontaine
retired
he
also
was
conservative
in
his
temperament
and
weary
of
public
life
the
passing
of
baldwin
and
lafontaine
from
the
scene
helped
to
clear
the
way
for
brown
to
take
his
own
course
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
open
breach
occurred
when
hincks
became
premier
brown
judged
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
speak
out
he
felt
that
he
must
make
a
fair
start
with
the
new
government
and
have
a
clear
understanding
at
the
outset
a
new
general
election
was
approaching
and
he
thought
that
the
issue
of
separation
of
church
and
state
must
be
clearly
placed
before
the
country
in
an
article
in
the
entitled
the
crisis
it
was
declared
that
the
time
for
action
had
come
one
parliament
had
been
lost
to
the
friends
of
religious
equality
they
could
not
afford
to
lose
another
it
was
contended
that
the
upper
canadian
reformers
suffered
by
their
connection
with
the
lower
canadian
party
complaint
was
made
that
the
hon
taché
had
advised
roman
catholics
to
make
common
cause
with
anglicans
in
resisting
the
secularization
of
the
clergy
reserves
had
described
the
advocates
of
secularization
as
pharisaical
brawlers
and
had
said
that
the
church
of
england
need
not
fear
their
hostility
because
the
power
of
the
lower
canadians
would
be
used
to
protect
the
anglican
church
this
said
the
was
a
challenge
which
the
friends
of
religious
equality
could
not
refuse
later
on
brown
wrote
a
series
of
letters
to
hincks
setting
forth
fully
his
grounds
of
complaint
against
the
government
failure
to
reform
the
representation
of
upper
canada
slackness
in
dealing
with
the
secularization
of
the
clergy
reserves
weakness
in
yielding
to
the
demand
for
separate
schools
all
this
he
attributed
to
roman
catholic
or
influence
chapter
v
the
clergy
reserves
the
clergy
reserves
were
for
many
years
a
fruitful
source
of
discontent
and
agitation
in
canada
they
had
their
origin
in
a
provision
of
the
constitutional
act
of
that
there
should
be
reserved
for
the
maintenance
and
support
of
a
protestant
clergy
in
upper
and
lower
canada
a
quantity
of
land
equal
in
value
to
a
seventh
part
of
grants
that
had
been
made
in
the
past
or
might
be
made
in
the
future
it
was
provided
also
that
rectories
might
be
erected
and
endowed
according
to
the
establishment
of
the
church
of
england
the
legislatures
were
to
be
allowed
to
vary
or
repeal
these
enactments
but
such
legislation
was
not
to
receive
the
royal
assent
before
it
had
been
laid
before
both
houses
of
the
imperial
parliament
did
the
words
protestant
clergy
apply
to
any
other
body
than
the
church
of
england
a
vast
amount
of
legal
learning
was
expended
on
this
question
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
intention
to
establish
and
endow
the
church
of
england
was
thoroughly
in
accord
with
the
ideas
of
colonial
government
prevailing
from
the
conquest
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
instructions
to
murray
and
other
early
governors
there
are
constant
injunctions
for
the
support
of
a
protestant
clergy
and
protestant
schools
to
the
end
that
the
church
of
england
may
be
established
both
in
principles
and
practice
governor
simcoe
we
are
told
attached
much
importance
to
every
establishment
of
church
and
state
that
upholds
a
distinction
of
ranks
and
lessens
the
undue
weight
of
the
democratic
influence
the
episcopal
system
was
interwoven
and
connected
with
the
monarchical
foundations
of
our
government
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
which
was
also
that
of
the
ruling
class
in
canada
the
country
was
to
be
made
as
much
unlike
the
united
states
as
possible
by
the
intrenchment
of
class
and
ecclesiastical
privileges
and
this
was
the
policy
pursued
up
to
the
time
that
responsible
government
was
obtained
those
outside
the
dominant
caste
in
religion
as
in
politics
were
branded
as
rebels
annexationists
yankees
republicans
and
as
this
dominant
caste
until
the
arrival
of
lord
elgin
had
the
ear
of
the
authorities
at
home
it
is
altogether
likely
that
the
act
of
was
framed
in
accordance
with
their
views
the
law
was
unjust
improvident
and
altogether
unsuited
to
the
circumstances
of
the
colony
lord
durham
estimated
that
the
members
and
adherents
of
the
church
of
england
allowing
its
largest
claim
were
not
more
than
probably
not
more
than
of
the
population
of
upper
canada
methodists
presbyterians
and
roman
catholics
each
claimed
a
larger
membership
he
declared
that
the
sanction
given
to
the
exclusive
claims
of
the
church
of
england
by
sir
john
colborne
establishment
of
rectories
was
in
the
opinion
of
many
persons
the
chief
cause
of
the
rebellion
and
it
was
an
abiding
and
unabated
cause
of
discontent
not
only
was
the
spirit
of
the
colony
opposed
to
the
establishment
and
domination
of
any
church
but
settlement
was
retarded
and
the
hardships
of
the
settler
increased
by
the
locking
up
of
enormous
tracts
of
land
in
addition
to
the
clergy
reserves
grants
were
made
to
officials
to
militia
men
to
the
children
of
united
empire
loyalists
and
others
in
the
hope
that
these
persons
would
settle
on
the
land
many
of
these
fell
into
the
hands
of
speculators
and
jobbers
who
bought
farms
of
two
hundred
acres
for
prices
ranging
from
a
gallon
of
rum
to
the
greater
part
of
these
grants
said
hawke
a
government
official
whose
evidence
is
given
in
the
appendix
to
durham
report
remain
in
an
unimproved
state
these
blocks
of
wild
land
place
the
actual
settler
in
an
almost
hopeless
condition
he
can
hardly
expect
during
his
lifetime
to
see
his
neighbourhood
contain
a
population
sufficiently
dense
to
support
mills
schools
places
of
worship
markets
or
shops
without
which
civilization
retrogrades
roads
under
such
circumstances
can
neither
be
opened
by
the
settlers
nor
kept
in
proper
repair
in
i
met
a
settler
from
the
township
of
warwick
on
the
caradoc
plains
returning
from
the
grist
mill
at
westminster
with
the
flour
and
bran
of
thirteen
bushels
of
wheat
he
had
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
a
horse
attached
to
his
wagon
and
had
been
absent
nine
days
and
did
not
expect
to
reach
home
until
the
following
evening
light
as
his
load
was
he
assured
me
that
he
had
to
unload
wholly
or
in
part
several
times
and
after
driving
his
wagon
through
the
swamps
to
pick
out
a
road
through
the
woods
where
the
swamps
or
gullies
were
fordable
and
to
carry
the
bags
on
his
back
and
replace
them
in
the
wagon
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
discuss
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
law
attempts
to
divide
the
endowment
among
various
denominations
or
other
efforts
at
compromise
the
radical
wing
of
the
reform
party
demanded
that
the
special
provision
for
the
support
of
the
church
of
england
should
be
abolished
and
a
system
of
free
popular
education
established
with
this
part
of
their
platform
brown
was
heartily
in
accord
on
this
point
he
agreed
with
the
clear
grits
that
the
government
was
moving
too
slowly
and
when
baldwin
was
succeeded
by
hincks
in
the
restraining
influence
of
his
respect
for
baldwin
being
removed
his
discontent
was
converted
into
open
and
determined
opposition
largely
by
the
influence
of
brown
and
the
public
opinion
in
was
aroused
to
a
high
degree
and
meetings
were
held
to
advocate
the
secularization
of
the
clergy
reserves
the
friends
of
the
old
order
were
singularly
unfortunate
in
their
mode
of
expressing
their
opinions
opposition
to
responsible
government
was
signalized
by
the
burning
of
the
parliament
buildings
and
the
mobbing
of
lord
elgin
in
montreal
opposition
to
religious
equality
was
signalized
by
the
mobbing
of
an
orderly
assembly
in
toronto
one
meeting
of
the
opponents
of
the
clergy
reserves
was
broken
up
by
these
means
and
a
second
meeting
was
attacked
by
a
mob
with
such
violence
as
to
necessitate
the
calling
out
of
a
company
of
british
soldiers
this
meeting
was
held
in
lawrence
hall
over
the
city
market
bearing
that
name
brown
was
chosen
to
move
a
resolution
denouncing
state
endowments
of
religion
and
did
so
in
a
speech
of
earnestness
and
argumentative
power
he
compared
the
results
of
church
establishments
with
those
of
voluntary
effort
in
england
in
scotland
in
france
and
in
canada
and
denounced
as
the
author
of
pride
intolerance
and
spiritual
coldness
when
he
said
i
read
the
history
of
the
human
race
and
trace
the
dark
record
of
wars
and
carnage
of
tyranny
robbery
and
injustice
in
every
shape
which
have
been
the
fruits
of
in
every
age
when
i
observe
the
degenerating
effect
which
it
has
ever
had
on
the
purity
and
simplicity
of
the
gospel
of
christ
turning
men
minds
from
its
great
truths
as
a
religion
of
the
heart
to
the
mere
outward
tinsel
to
the
forms
and
ceremonies
on
which
priestcraft
flourishes
when
i
see
that
at
all
times
it
has
been
made
the
instrument
of
the
rich
and
powerful
in
oppressing
the
poor
and
weak
i
can
not
but
reject
it
utterly
as
in
direct
hostility
to
the
whole
spirit
of
the
gospel
to
that
glorious
system
which
teaches
men
to
set
not
their
hearts
on
this
world
and
to
walk
humbly
before
god
he
held
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
the
state
to
teach
religious
truth
there
is
no
standard
for
truth
we
can
not
even
agree
on
the
meaning
of
words
setting
aside
the
injustice
of
forcing
men
to
pay
money
for
the
support
of
what
they
deemed
religious
error
it
was
most
dangerous
to
admit
that
the
magistrate
is
to
decide
for
god
for
that
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
establishment
principle
once
admit
that
principle
and
no
curb
can
be
set
upon
its
operation
who
shall
restrict
what
god
has
appointed
and
thus
the
extent
to
which
the
conscience
of
men
may
be
constrained
or
persecution
for
truth
sake
may
be
carried
depends
entirely
on
the
ignorance
or
enlightenment
of
the
civil
magistrate
there
is
no
safety
out
of
the
principle
that
religion
is
a
matter
entirely
between
man
and
his
god
and
that
the
whole
duty
of
the
magistrate
is
to
secure
every
one
in
the
peaceful
observance
of
it
anything
else
leads
to
oppression
and
injustice
but
this
can
never
lead
to
either
a
notable
part
of
the
speech
was
a
defence
of
free
education
i
can
conceive
he
said
nothing
more
unprincipled
than
a
scheme
to
array
the
youth
of
the
province
in
sectarian
bands
to
teach
them
from
the
cradle
up
to
know
each
other
as
methodist
boys
and
presbyterian
boys
and
episcopal
boys
surely
surely
we
have
enough
of
this
most
wretched
sectarianism
in
our
churches
without
carrying
it
further
to
protect
themselves
from
interruption
the
advocates
of
secularization
had
taken
advantage
of
a
law
which
allowed
them
to
declare
their
meeting
as
private
and
exclude
disturbers
their
opponents
held
another
meeting
in
the
adjoining
where
by
resolution
they
expressed
indignation
at
the
repeated
attempts
of
a
godless
association
to
stir
up
religious
strife
and
declared
that
the
purposes
of
the
association
if
carried
out
would
bring
about
not
only
the
severance
of
british
connection
but
socialism
republicanism
and
infidelity
the
horrified
listeners
were
told
how
rousseau
and
voltaire
had
corrupted
france
how
religion
was
overthrown
and
the
naked
goddess
of
reason
set
up
as
an
object
of
worship
they
were
told
that
the
clergy
reserves
were
a
gift
to
the
nation
from
our
good
king
george
the
third
abolish
them
and
the
british
flag
would
refuse
to
float
over
anarchy
and
confusion
finally
they
were
assured
that
they
could
thrash
the
lawrence
hall
audience
in
a
fight
but
were
nevertheless
advised
to
go
quietly
home
this
advice
was
apparently
accepted
in
the
spirit
of
the
admonition
do
nail
his
ears
to
the
pump
for
the
crowd
immediately
marched
to
lawrence
hall
cheering
groaning
and
shouting
they
were
met
by
the
mayor
two
aldermen
and
the
chief
constable
and
told
that
they
could
not
be
admitted
stones
and
bricks
were
thrown
through
the
windows
of
the
hall
the
riot
act
was
read
by
an
alderman
and
the
british
regiment
then
quartered
in
the
town
the
was
sent
for
there
was
considerable
delay
in
bringing
the
troops
and
in
the
meantime
there
was
great
disorder
persons
leaving
the
hall
were
assaulted
and
the
mayor
was
struck
in
the
face
with
a
stone
and
severely
cut
a
company
of
the
arrived
at
midnight
after
which
the
violence
of
the
mob
abated
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
settlement
of
the
question
may
be
briefly
referred
to
in
the
canadian
parliament
had
asked
for
power
to
dispose
of
the
reserves
with
the
understanding
that
emoluments
derived
by
existing
incumbents
should
be
guaranteed
during
their
lives
the
address
having
been
forwarded
to
england
lord
john
russell
informed
the
that
a
bill
would
be
introduced
in
compliance
with
the
wish
of
the
canadian
parliament
but
in
the
russell
government
resigned
and
was
succeeded
by
that
of
the
earl
of
derby
derby
lord
stanley
had
been
colonial
secretary
in
the
peel
government
which
had
shown
a
strong
bias
against
canadian
sir
john
pakington
declared
that
the
advisers
of
her
majesty
were
not
inclined
to
aid
in
the
diversion
to
other
purposes
of
the
only
public
fund
for
the
support
of
divine
worship
and
religious
instruction
in
canada
though
they
would
entertain
proposals
for
new
dispositions
of
the
fund
hincks
who
was
then
in
england
protested
vigorously
against
the
disregard
of
the
wishes
of
the
canadian
people
when
the
legislature
assembled
in
it
carried
at
his
instance
an
address
to
the
crown
strongly
upholding
the
canadian
demand
brown
contended
that
the
language
was
too
strong
and
the
action
too
weak
he
made
a
counter
proposal
which
found
little
support
that
the
canadian
parliament
itself
enact
a
measure
providing
for
the
sale
of
the
clergy
lands
to
actual
settlers
and
the
appropriation
of
the
funds
for
the
maintenance
of
common
schools
with
the
fall
of
the
derby
administration
in
england
ended
the
opposition
from
that
source
to
the
canadian
demands
but
hincks
who
had
firmly
vindicated
the
right
of
the
canadian
parliament
to
legislate
on
the
matter
now
hesitated
to
use
the
power
placed
in
his
hands
and
declared
that
legislation
should
be
deferred
until
a
new
parliament
had
been
chosen
the
result
was
that
the
work
of
framing
the
measure
of
settlement
fell
into
the
hands
of
john
macdonald
the

that

cordially
adhered

that
he
objected
to
the
roman
catholic
church
trenching
on

civil

of

community

that
he
would
be
ashamed
to
advocate
any
principle
or

which
would
restrict
the
liberty
of
any
man
or
deprive
him

representation

afterwards
came
to
be
the
watchword
of
those
who
demanded
that
upper
canada
should
have
a
larger
representation
than
lower
canada
but
as
yet
this
question
had
not
arisen
definitely
the
population
of
upper
canada
was
nearly
doubled
between
and
but
it
did
not
appear
until
that
it
had
passed
the
lower
province
in
population
the
advocacy
of
free
schools
was
an
important
part
of
the
platform
during
the
month
of
january
the
contained
frequent
articles
reports
of
public
meetings
and
letters
on
the
subject
it
was
contended
by
some
of
the
opponents
of
free
schools
that
the
poor
could
obtain
free
education
by
pleading
their
poverty
but
the
replied
that
education
should
not
be
a
matter
of
charity
but
should
be
regarded
as
a
right
like
the
use
of
pavements
the
matter
was
made
an
issue
in
the
election
of
school
trustees
in
several
places
and
in
the
toronto
election
the
advocates
of
free
schools
were
successful
it
will
be
convenient
to
note
here
that
brown
views
on
higher
education
corresponded
with
his
views
on
public
schools
in
each
case
he
opposed
sectarian
control
on
the
ground
that
it
would
dissipate
the
energies
of
the
people
and
divide
among
half
a
dozen
sects
the
money
which
might
maintain
one
efficient
system
these
views
were
fully
set
forth
in
a
speech
made
on
february
upon
a
bill
introduced
by
hincks
to
amend
the
law
relating
to
the
university
of
toronto
brown
denounced
the
measure
as
a
surrender
to
the
sectaries
there
were
two
distinct
ideas
he
said
in
regard
to
higher
education
in
upper
canada
one
was
that
a
university
must
be
connected
with
a
church
and
under
the
management
of
the
clergy
without
whose
control
infidelity
would
prevail
the
reform
party
led
by
baldwin
and
hincks
had
denounced
these
views
as
the
mere
of
priestcraft
they
held
that
there
should
be
one
great
literary
and
scientific
institution
to
which
all
canadians
might
resort
on
equal
terms
this
position
was
founded
not
on
contempt
for
religion
but
on
respect
for
religion
liberty
and
conscience
to
no
one
principle
does
the
liberal
party
owe
so
many
triumphs
as
to
that
of
university
education
until
anglican
control
prevailed
then
various
unsuccessful
efforts
at
compromise
were
made
and
finally
in
after
twenty
years
of
agitation
the
desire
of
the
liberal
party
was
fulfilled
and
a
noble
institute
of
learning
established
this
act
alone
would
have
entitled
robert
baldwin
to
the
lasting
gratitude
of
his
countrymen
continuing
brown
said
that
the
hincks
bill
was
reactionary
that
the
original
draft
even
contained
a
reference
to
the
godless
character
of
the
institution
that
the
plan
would
fritter
away
the
endowment
by
dividing
it
among
sects
and
among
localities
he
opposed
the
abolition
of
the
faculties
of
law
and
medicine
rightly
directed
the
study
of
law
was
ennobling
and
jurists
should
receive
an
education
which
would
give
them
broad
and
generous
views
of
the
principles
of
justice
the
endowment
of
the
university
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
attract
eminent
teachers
and
to
encourage
students
by
scholarships
we
are
laying
the
foundations
of
a
great
political
and
social
system
our
vote
may
deeply
affect
for
good
or
evil
the
future
of
the
country
i
adjure
the
house
to
pause
ere
destroying
an
institution
which
may
one
day
be
among
the
chief
glories
of
a
great
and
wise
people
brown
was
elected
by
a
good
majority
the
general
result
of
the
election
was
favourable
to
the
administration
a
large
part
of
the
interval
between
the
election
and
the
first
session
of
the
new
parliament
was
spent
by
hincks
in
england
where
he
made
some
progress
in
the
settlement
of
the
clergy
reserve
question
and
where
he
also
made
arrangements
for
the
building
of
the
grand
trunk
railway
from
montreal
westward
through
upper
canada
negotiations
for
the
building
of
the
intercolonial
railway
connecting
lower
canada
with
the
maritime
provinces
fell
through
and
the
enterprise
was
delayed
for
some
years
it
was
a
matter
of
some
importance
that
the
first
parliament
in
which
brown
took
part
was
held
in
the
city
of
quebec
he
had
entered
on
a
course
which
made
catholics
and
regard
him
as
their
enemy
and
in
quebec
french
and
catholic
influence
was
dominant
brown
felt
keenly
the
hostility
of
his
surroundings
and
there
are
frequent
references
in
his
speeches
and
in
the
correspondence
of
the
to
the
unfriendly
faces
in
the
gallery
of
the
chamber
and
to
the
social
power
exercised
by
the
church
nothing
says
the
hon
james
young
could
exceed
the
courage
and
eloquence
with
which
brown
stood
up
night
after
night
demanding
justice
for
upper
canada
in
the
face
of
a
hostile
majority
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
and
still
more
hostile
auditors
in
the
galleries
above
so
high
indeed
did
public
feeling
run
on
some
occasions
that
fears
were
entertained
for
his
personal
safety
and
his
friends
occasionally
insisted
after
late
and
exciting
debates
lasting
often
till
long
after
midnight
on
accompanying
him
young
adds
that
these
fears
were
not
shared
by
brown
and
that
they
proved
to
be
groundless
brown
in
fact
did
not
regard
the
quebec
influence
as
a
personal
grievance
but
he
argued
that
on
public
grounds
the
legislature
ought
not
to
meet
in
a
city
where
freedom
of
speech
might
be
impaired
by
local
sentiment
that
he
harboured
no
malice
was
very
finely
shown
when
parliament
met
four
years
afterwards
in
toronto
he
had
just
concluded
a
powerful
speech
the
galleries
were
crowded
this
time
with
a
friendly
audience
which
at
length
broke
into
applause
brown
checked
the
demonstration
i
have
addressed
none
he
said
but
members
of
this
house
and
trust
that
members
from
lower
canada
will
not
be
overawed
by
any
manifestation
of
feeling
in
this
chamber
i
shall
be
ready
on
all
occasions
to
discourage
it
in
lower
canada
i
stood
almost
alone
in
supporting
my
views
and
i
well
know
how
painful
these
manifestations
are
to
a
stranger
in
a
strange
place
i
do
sincerely
trust
that
gentlemen
of
french
origin
will
feel
as
free
to
speak
here
as
if
they
were
in
quebec
brown
made
his
maiden
speech
during
the
debate
on
the
address
it
is
described
in
a
contemporary
account
as
a
terrible
onslaught
on
the
government
an
idea
of
violence
conveyed
in
this
and
other
comments
would
appear
to
have
been
derived
from
the
extreme
energy
of
gestures
the
printed
report
of
the
speech
does
not
give
that
impression
though
severe
it
was
in
the
main
historical
and
argumentative
it
contained
a
review
of
the
political
history
of
canada
from
the
time
of
the
rupture
between
metcalfe
and
his
ministers
up
to
the
time
when
the
principle
of
responsible
government
was
conceded
brown
argued
that
reformers
were
bound
to
stand
by
that
principle
and
to
accept
all
its
obligations
in
his
judgment
it
was
essential
to
the
right
working
of
responsible
government
that
parties
should
declare
their
principles
clearly
and
stand
or
fall
by
them
if
they
held
one
set
of
principles
out
of
office
and
another
set
in
office
they
would
reduce
responsible
government
to
a
farce
he
acknowledged
the
services
which
hincks
and
morin
had
rendered
in
fighting
for
responsible
government
but
he
charged
them
with
betraying
that
principle
by
their
own
conduct
in
office
two
systems
of
government
he
said
were
being
tested
on
this
continent
the
american
system
contained
checks
and
balances
the
british
system
could
be
carried
on
only
by
the
observance
of
certain
unwritten
laws
and
especially
a
strict
good
faith
and
adherence
to
principle
brown
as
a
party
man
adhered
firmly
to
burke
definition
of
party
a
body
of
men
united
for
promoting
by
their
joint
endeavours
the
national
interest
upon
some
particular
principle
on
which
they
are
all
agreed
with
him
was
a
minor
consideration
there
is
no
theory
in
the
principle
of
responsible
government
more
vital
to
its
right
working
than
that
parties
shall
take
their
stand
on
the
prominent
questions
of
the
day
and
mount
to
office
or
resign
it
through
the
success
or
failure
of
principles
to
which
they
are
attached
this
is
the
great

rise
of
brown
influence
the
condition
of
parties
in
the
legislature
was
peculiar
the
most
formidable
antagonist
of
the
reform
government
was
the
man
who
was
rapidly
rising
to
the
leadership
of
the
reform
party
the
old
tory
party
was
dead
and
its
leader
sir
allan
macnab
was
almost
inactive
macdonald
who
was
to
and
lead
the
new
conservative
party
was
playing
a
waiting
game
taking
advantage
of
brown
tremendous
blows
at
the
ministry
and
for
the
time
being
satisfied
with
a
less
prominent
part
in
the
conflict
brown
rapidly
rose
to
a
commanding
position
in
the
assembly
he
did
this
without
any
or
skill
in
the
management
of
men
with
scarcely
any
assistance
and
almost
entirely
by
his
own
energy
and
force
of
conviction
his
industry
and
capacity
for
work
were
prodigious
he
spoke
frequently
and
on
a
wide
range
of
subjects
requiring
careful
study
and
mastery
of
facts
in
the
divisions
he
obtained
little
support
he
had
antagonized
the
the
clear
grits
of
upper
canada
were
for
the
time
determined
to
stand
by
the
government
and
his
views
were
usually
not
such
as
the
conservatives
could
endorse
although
they
occasionally
followed
him
in
order
to
embarrass
the
government
brown
course
in
parliament
however
was
pointing
to
a
far
more
important
result
than
changes
in
the
personnel
of
hincks
once
told
him
that
the
logical
conclusion
of
that
course
was
the
dissolution
of
the
union
there
was
a
measure
of
truth
in
this
if
he
had
said
dissolution
or
modification
he
would
have
been
absolutely
right
between
the
ideas
of
upper
canada
and
lower
canada
there
was
a
difference
so
great
that
a
legislative
union
was
foredoomed
to
failure
and
separation
could
be
avoided
only
by
a
federation
which
allowed
each
community
to
take
its
own
way
brown
did
not
create
these
difficulties
but
he
emphasized
them
and
so
forced
and
hastened
the
application
of
the
remedy
up
to
the
time
of
his
entering
parliament
his
policy
had
related
mainly
to
upper
canada
in
parliament
however
a
mass
of
legislation
emanating
from
lower
canada
aroused
his
strong
opposition
in
the
main
it
was
ecclesiastical
legislation
incorporating
roman
catholic
institutions
giving
them
power
to
hold
lands
to
control
education
and
otherwise
to
strengthen
the
authority
of
the
church
over
the
people
it
is
not
necessary
to
discuss
these
measures
in
detail
the
object
is
to
arrive
at
brown
point
of
view
and
it
was
this
that
the
seat
of
government
was
a
catholic
city
and
that
legislation
and
administration
were
largely
controlled
by
the
priesthood
he
complained
that
upper
canada
was
unfairly
treated
in
regard
to
legislation
and
expenditure
that
its
public
opinion
was
disregarded
and
that
it
was
not
fairly
represented
the
question
of
representation
steadily
assumed
more
importance
in
his
mind
and
he
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
representation
by
population
was
the
true
remedy
for
all
the
grievances
of
which
he
complained
lower
canada
being
now
numerically
the
weaker
naturally
clung
to
the
system
which
gave
it
equality
of
representation
in
all
these
matters
the
breach
between
george
brown
and
the
lower
canadian
representatives
was
widening
while
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
the
voice
of
upper
canadian
opinion
when
in
the
intervals
between
parliamentary
sessions
he
visited
various
places
in
upper
canada
he
found
himself
the
most
popular
man
in
the
community
he
addressed
great
public
meetings
banquets
were
given
in
his
honour
the
prominent
part
taken
by
ministers
of
the
gospel
at
these
gatherings
illustrates
at
once
the
weakness
and
the
strength
of
his
position
he
satisfied
the
nonconformist
conscience
of
upper
canada
by
his
advocacy
not
only
of
religious
equality
but
of
the
prohibition
of
the
liquor
traffic
and
of
the
cessation
of
sunday
labour
by
public
servants
but
this
very
attitude
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
work
with
any
political
party
in
lower
canada
in
there
was
a
remarkable
article
in
the
cobourg
a
conservative
journal
illustrating
the
hold
which
brown
had
obtained
upon
upper
canadian
sentiment
this
attitude
was
called
forth
by
a
banquet
given
to
brown
by
the
reformers
of
the
neighbourhood
it
expressed
regret
that
the
honour
was
given
on
party
grounds
had
it
been
given
on
the
ground
of
his
services
to
protestantism
it
would
have
brought
out
every
orangeman
in
the
country
conservatives
disagreed
with
brown
about
the
clergy
reserves
but
if
the
reserves
must
be
secularized
every
conservative
in
canada
would
join
brown
in
his
crusade
against
roman
catholic
endowments
then
follows
this
estimate
of
brown
character
in
george
brown
we
see
no
agitator
or
demagogue
but
the
strivings
of
common
sense
a
sober
will
to
attain
the
useful
the
practical
and
the
needful
he
has
patient
courage
stubborn
endurance
and
obstinate
resistance
and
desperate
daring
in
attacking
what
he
believes
to
be
wrong
and
in
defending
what
he
believes
to
be
right
there
is
no
cant
or
parade
or
tinsel
or
about
him
he
takes
his
stand
against
open
palpable
tangible
wrongs
against
the
tyranny
which
violates
men
roofs
and
the
intolerance
which
vexes
their
consciences
true
he
is
wrong
on
the
reserves
question
but
then
he
is
honest
we
know
where
to
find
him
he
does
not
like
some
of
our
reformers
give
us
to
understand
that
he
will
support
us
and
then
turn
his
back
he
does
not
slip
the
word
of
promise
to
the
ear
and
then
break
it
to
the
lips
leaving
the
reserves
out
of
the
question
george
brown
is
eminently
conservative
in
his
spirit
his
leading
principle
as
all
his
writings
will
show
is
to
reconcile
progress
with
preservation
change
with
stability
the
alteration
of
incidents
with
the
maintenance
of
essentials
change
for
the
sake
of
change
agitation
for
vanity
for
applause
or
mischief
he
has
contemptuously
repudiated
he
is
not
like
the
clear
grit
a
republican
of
the
first
water
but
on
the
contrary
looks
to
the
connection
with
the
mother
country
not
as
fable
or
unreality
or
fleeting
vision
but
as
alike
our
interest
and
our
duty
as
that
which
should
ever
be
our
beacon
our
guide
and
our
goal
in
the
relative
strength
of
brown
and
the
ministers
was
tested
in
a
series
of
demonstrations
held
throughout
canada
the
hon
james
young
gives
a
vivid
description
of
brown
as
he
appeared
at
a
banquet
given
in
his
honour
at
galt
he
was
a
striking
figure
standing
fully
six
feet
two
inches
high
with
a
body
well
balanced
head

spoke
with
such
an

of

that

of
the
drinking
habits
of
that
day
in
a
pamphlet
issued
by

company
for
the
information
of
intending
immigrants
whiskey
was
described
as
a
cheap
and
wholesome
beverage
its
cheapness
and
abundance
caused
it
to
be
used
in
somewhat
the
same
way
as
the
small
beer
of
england
and
it
was
a
common
practice
to
order
a
jug
from
the
grocer
along
with
the
food

of
the
family
when
a
motion
favouring

was
introduced
in

there
were
frequent
references
to

habits
of

of

was
greeted
with

laughter
he
said
that
he
was

of
the
cause
of
hilarity
but
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
pleasure
to
the
general
good
sir
allan
macnab
the
leader
of
the
opposition
moved
a
farcical
amendment
under
which
every
member
was
to
sign
a
pledge
of
abstinence
and
to
be
disqualified

brown
made

speech
in

he
remarked
that

contained
nine

whiskey
shops

bars
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
thirty
taverns
one
hundred
and
thirty
breweries
and
one
hundred
and
distilleries
the
marked
diminution
of
intemperance
in
the
last
fifty
years
may
be
attributed
in
part
to
restrictive
laws
and
in
part
to
the
work
of
the
temperance
societies
which
rivalled

social
attractions

were

retired

gave
his

being
of
opinion
that
the

by

presented
the
only
solution

the
difficulties
caused
by
a
coalition
of
parties
holding
no
sentiments
in

a
coalition
which
rarely
takes

in

i
deemed
it
my
duty
to
give
my
support
to
that
government
during
the
short
period
that
i
continued
in
public
life
whether
the
government
was
a
true
coalition
or
a
tory
combination
under
that
name
was
a
question
fiercely
debated
at
that
time
it
certainly
did
not
stand
for
the
toryism
that
had
resisted
responsible
government
the
secularization
of
the
clergy
reserves
and
the
participation
of
in
the
government
of
the
country
it
had
at
first
some
of
the
elements
of
a
coalition
but
it
gradually
came
to
represent
conservatism
and
the
personal
ascendency
of
john
macdonald
robert
baldwin
from
his
retirement
gave
his
approval
to
the
combination
and
hence
arose
the
baldwin
reformer
blessed
as
a
convert
by
one
party
and
cursed
as
a
renegade
by
the
other
reconstruction
on
one
side
was
followed
by
reconstruction
on
the
other
upper
canadian
reformers
rallied
round
brown
and
an
alliance
was
formed
with
the
quebec
rouges
this
was
a
natural
alliance
of
radical
reformers
in
both
provinces
some
light
is
thrown
on
it
by
an
article
published
in
the
in
the
writer
said
that
in
some
young
men
of
montreal
fresh
from
the
schools
and
filled
to
the
brim
with
the
republican
opinions
which
had
spread
from
france
throughout
all
europe
formed
associations
and
established
newspapers
advocating
extreme
political
views
they
declaimed
in
favour
of
liberty
and
against
priestcraft
and
tyranny
with
all
the
ardour
and
freshness
of
youth
their
talents
and
the
evident
purity
and
sincerity
of
their
motives
made
a
strong
impression
on
their
countrymen
contrasting
as
they
did
with
the
selfishness
and
mediocrity
of
other
leaders
and
the
result
was
that
the
rouge
party
was
growing
in
strength
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
country
with
the
growth
of
strength
there
had
come
a
growing
sense
of
responsibility
greater
moderation
and
prudence
in
the
legislature
at
least
the
rouges
had
not
expressed
a
single
sentiment
on
general
policy
to
which
a
british
constitutional
reformer
might
not
assent
they
were
the
true
allies
of
the
upper
canadian
reformers
and
in
fact
the
only
liberals
among
the
they
had
reform
principles
they
maintained
a
high
standard
of
political
morality
they
stood
for
the
advance
of
education
and
for
liberty
of
speech
they
were
the
hope
of
canada
and
their
attitude
gave
promise
that
a
brighter
day
was
about
to
dawn
on
the
political
horizon
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
that
the
liberals
could
continue
to
receive
that
solid
support
from
lower
canada
which
they
had
received
in
the
days
of
the
alliance
in
those
days
the
issue
was
whether
should
be
allowed
to
take
part
in
the
government
of
the
country
or
should
be
excluded
as
rebels
the
reformers
championed
their
cause
and
received
the
solid
support
of
the
people
but
when
once
the
principle
for
which
they
contested
was
conceded
it
was
perceived
that
lower
canada
like
upper
canada
had
its
conservative
element
and
party
lines
were
formed
brown
held
that
there
could
be
no
lasting
alliance
between
upper
canadian
reformers
and
lower
canadian
conservatives
and
especially
with
those
lower
canadians
who
defended
the
power
and
privileges
of
the
church
he
was
perfectly
willing
that
electors
holding
these
views
should
go
to
the
conservative
party
which
was
their
proper
place
the
rouges
could
not
bring
to
the
liberal
party
the
numerical
strength
of
the
supporters
of
lafontaine
but
as
they
really
held
liberal
principles
the
alliance
was
solidly
based
and
was
more
likely
to
endure
the
leader
of
the
rouges
was
a
dorion
a
distinguished
advocate
and
a
man
of
culture
refinement
and
eloquence
he
was
and
while
in
physique
and
manner
the
two
were
strongly
contrasted
they
were
drawn
together
by
the
chivalry
and
devotion
to
principle
which
characterized
both
and
they
formed
a
strong
friendship
for
four
years
said
brown
in
a
public
address
i
acted
with
him
in
the
ranks
of
the
opposition
learned
to
value
most
highly
the
uprightness
of
his
character
the
liberality
of
his
opinions
and
the
firmness
of
his
convictions
on
most
questions
of
public
general
policy
we
heartily
agreed
and
regularly
voted
together
on
the
questions
that
divided
all
upper
canadians
and
all
lower
canadians
alone
we
differed
and
on
these
we
had
held
many
earnest
consultations
from
year
to
year
with
a
view
to
their
removal
without
arriving
at
the
conviction
that
when
we
had
the
opportunity
we
could
find
the
mode
their
habit
was
not
to
attempt
to
conceal
these
sectional
differences
but
to
recognize
them
frankly
with
a
view
to
finding
the
remedy
it
was
rarely
that
either
presented
a
resolution
to
the
house
without
asking
the
advice
of
the
other
they
knew
each
other
views
perfectly
and
on
many
questions
especially
of
commerce
and
finance
they
were
in
perfect
accord
by
this
process
of
evolution
liberals
and
conservatives
were
restored
to
their
proper
and
historic
places
and
the
way
was
cleared
for
new
issues
these
issues
arose
out
of
the
attempt
to
join
upper
and
lower
canada
in
a
legislative
union
a
large
part
of
the
history
of
this
period
is
the
history
of
an
attempt
to
escape
the
consequences
of
that
blunder
this
was
the
reason
why
every
ministry
had
its
double
name
the
the
the
the
the
this
was
the
reason
why
every
ministry
had
its
east
for
lower
canada
and
its
west
for
upper
canada
in
his
speech
on
confederation
sir
john
macdonald
said
that
although
the
union
was
legislative
in
name
it
was
federal
in
fact
that
in
matters
affecting
upper
canada
alone
upper
canadian
members
claimed
and
usually
exercised
exclusive
power
and
so
with
lower
canada
the
consolidated
statutes
of
canada
and
the
consolidated
statutes
of
upper
canada
must
be
sought
in
separate
volumes
the
practice
of
legislating
for
one
province
alone
was
not
confined
to
local
or
private
matters
for
instance
as
the
two
communities
had
widely
different
ideas
as
to
sabbath
observance
the
stricter
law
was
enacted
for
upper
canada
alone
hence
also
arose
the
theory
of
the
double
majority
that
a
ministry
must
for
the
support
of
its
general
policy
have
a
majority
from
each
province
but
all
these
shifts
and
devices
could
not
stay
the
agitation
for
a
radical
remedy
some
reformers
proposed
to
dissolve
the
union
brown
believed
that
the
difficulty
would
be
solved
by
representation
by
population
concerning
which
a
word
of
explanation
is
necessary
when
the
provinces
were
united
in
the
population
of
lower
canada
exceeded
that
of
upper
canada
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
two
if
said
lord
durham
the
population
of
upper
canada
is
rightly
estimated
at
four
hundred
thousand
the
english
inhabitants
of
lower
canada
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
the
french
at
four
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
union
of
the
two
provinces
would
not
only
give
a
clear
english
majority
but
one
which
would
be
increased
every
year
by
the
influence
of
english
emigration
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
the
french
when
once
placed
by
the
legitimate
course
of
events
in
a
minority
would
abandon
their
vain
hopes
of
nationality
but
he
added
that
he
was
averse
to
every
plan
that
had
been
proposed
for
giving
an
equal
number
of
members
to
the
two
provinces
the
object
could
be
attained
without
any
violation
of
the
principles
of
representation
such
as
would
antagonize
public
opinion
and
when
emigration
shall
have
increased
the
english
population
of
the
upper
province
the
adoption
of
such
a
principle
would
operate
to
defeat
the
very
purpose
it
is
intended
to
serve
it
appears
to
me
that
any
such
electoral
arrangement
founded
on
the
present
provincial
divisions
would
tend
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
union
and
perpetuate
the
idea
of
disunion
counsels
less
wise
and
just
prevailed
and
the
united
province
was
gerrymandered
against
lord
durham
protest
lower
canada
complained
of
the
injustice
and
with
good
reason
in
the
course
of
time
lord
durham
prediction
was
fulfilled
by
immigration
the
population
of
upper
canada
overtook
and
passed
that
of
lower
canada
the
census
of
gave
upper
canada
a
population
of
nine
hundred
and
thousand
and
lower
canada
a
population
of
eight
hundred
and
ninety
thousand
two
hundred
and
brown
began
to
press
for
representation
by
population
he
was
met
by
two
objections
it
was
argued
on
behalf
of
the
that
they
had
submitted
to
the
injustice
while
they
had
the
larger
population
and
that
the
upper
canadians
ought
to
follow
their
example
brown
admitted
the
force
of
this
argument
but
he
met
it
by
showing
that
the
lower
canadians
had
been
for
eight
years
and
that
by
the
time
the
new
representation
went
into
force
the
upper
canadians
would
have
suffered
injustice
for
about
an
equal
term
so
that
a
balance
might
be
struck
a
more
formidable
objection
was
raised
by
hincks
who
said
that
the
union
was
in
the
nature
of
a
compact
between
two
nations
having
widely
different
institutions
that
the
basis
of
the
compact
was
equal
representation
and
that
brown
proposition
would
destroy
that
basis
cartier
said
that
representation
by
population
could
not
be
had
without
repeal
of
the
union
the
were
afraid
that
they
would
be
swamped
and
would
be
obliged
to
accept
the
laws
and
institutions
of
the
majority
it
is
impossible
to
deny
the
force
of
these
objections
in
lower
canada
had
been
compelled
to
join
a
union
in
which
the
voting
power
of
upper
canada
was
arbitrarily
increased
if
this
was
due
to
distrust
to
fear
of
french
domination
could
not
be
blamed
for
showing
an
equal
distrust
of
english
domination
and
for
refusing
to
give
up
the
barrier
which
as
they
believed
protected
their
peculiar
institutions
ultimately
the
solution
was
found
in
the
application
of
the
federal
system
giving
unity
in
matters
requiring
common
action
and
freedom
to
differ
in
matters
of
local
concern
towards
this
solution
events
were
tending
and
the
importance
of
brown
agitation
for
representation
by
population
which
gained
immense
force
in
upper
canada
lies
in
its
relation
to
the

charges
and
announced
that
he
would
move
for
a
committee
of
inquiry
he
was
angrily
interrupted
by
the
who
flung
the
lie
across
the
house
the
was
a
son
of
the
warden
of
the
penitentiary
who
had
been
dismissed
in
consequence
of
the
report
of
the
commission
macdonald
was
a
strong
personal
friend
of
the
warden
and
had
attempted
some
years
before
to
bring
his
case
before
the
assembly
brown
promptly
moved
for
the
committee
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
presented
that
tribunal
with
a
dramatic
surprise
it
was
supposed
that
the
report
of
the
penitentiary
committee
had
been
burned
and
the
attack
on
brown
was
made
upon
that
supposition
when
brown
was
called
as
a
witness
however
he
produced
the
original
report
with
all
the
evidence
and
declared
that
it
had
never
been
out
of
his
possession
for
one
hour
the
effect
of
this
disclosure
on
his
assailants
is
shown
in
a
letter
addressed
to
the
committee
by
vankoughnet
macdonald
counsel
macdonald
he
said
had
been
getting
up
his
case
on
the
assumption
and
belief
that
these
minutes
had
been
destroyed
and
could
not
be
procured
and
much
of
the
labour
he
had
been
allowed
to
go
to
by
brown
for
that
purpose
would
now
be
thrown
away
the
whole
manner
of
giving
evidence
would
now
be
altered
the
graver
charges
of
subornation
of
perjury
were
abandoned
and
macdonald
friends
confined
themselves
to
an
attempt
to
prove
that
the
inquiry
had
been
unfairly
conducted
that
the
warden
had
been
harshly
treated
and
the
testimony
not
fairly
reported
it
was
a
political
committee
with
a
conservative
majority
and
the
majority
giving
up
all
hope
of
injuring
brown
bent
its
energies
to
saving
macdonald
from
the
consequences
of
his
reckless
violence
the
liberal
members
asked
for
a
complete
exoneration
of
brown
a
supporter
of
the
government
was
willing
to
exonerate
brown
if
macdonald
were
allowed
to
escape
without
censure
a
majority
of
the
committee
however
took
refuge
in
a
rambling
deliverance
which
was
sharply
attacked
in
the
legislature
sir
allan
macnab
bluntly
declared
that
the
charge
had
been
completely
disproved
and
that
the
committee
ought
to
have
had
the
manliness
to
say
so
drummond
a
member
of
the
government
also
said
that
the
attack
had
failed
the
accusers
were
willing
to
allow
the
matter
to
drop
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
report
was
never
put
to
a
vote
but
brown
would
not
allow
them
to
escape
so
easily
near
the
close
of
the
session
he
made
a
speech
which
gave
a
new
character
to
the
discussion
up
to
this
time
it
had
been
a
personal
question
between
brown
and
his
assailants
brown
dealt
with
this
aspect
of
the
matter
briefly
but
forcibly
he
declared
that
not
only
his
conduct
but
the
character
of
the
other
commissioners
was
fully
vindicated
and
that
a
conspiracy
to
drive
him
from
public
life
had
signally
failed
conservative
members
had
met
him
and
admitted
that
there
was
no
truth
in
the
charges
but
had
pleaded
that
they
must
go
with
the
party
members
had
actually
been
asked
to
pair
off
on
the
question
of
upholding
or
destroying
his
character
before
they
had
heard
his
defence
from
these
personal
matters
he
returned
to
the
abuses
that
had
been
discovered
by
the
commission
a
terrible
story
of
neglect
and
cruelty
was
told
these
charges
did
not
rest
on
the
testimony
of
prisoners
they
were
sustained
by
the
evidence
of
officers
and
by
the
records
of
the
institution
if
said
the
speaker
every
word
of
the
witnesses
called
by
the
commissioners
were
struck
out
and
the
case
left
to
rest
on
the
testimony
of
the
warden
own
witnesses
and
the
official
records
of
the
prison
there
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
the
blackest
record
of
wickedness
that
ever
disgraced
a
civilized
country
amid
applause
expressions
of
amazement
and
cries
of
shame
from
the
galleries
brown
told
of
the
abuses
laid
bare
by
the
prison
commission
he
told
of
prisoners
fed
with
rotten
meal
and
bread
infested
with
maggots
of
children
beaten
with
cat
and
rawhide
for
childish
faults
of
a
box
in
which
men
and
even
women
were
made
to
stand
or
rather
crouch
their
limbs
cramped
and
their
lungs
scantily
supplied
with
air
from
a
few
holes
brown
speech
virtually
closed
the
case
although
macdonald
strove
to
prove
that
the
accounts
of
outrages
were
exaggerated
that
the
warden
smith
was
himself
a
man
and
that
he
had
been
harshly
treated
by
the
commissioners
in
a
letter
written
about
this
time
macdonald
said
that
he
was
carrying
on
a
war
against
brown
that
he
would
prove
him
a
most
dishonest
dishonourable
fellow
and
in
doing
so
i
will
only
pay
him
a
debt
that
i
owe
him
for
abusing
me
for
months
together
in
his
newspaper
whatever
the
provocation
may
have
been
the
personal
relations
of
the
two
men
were
further
embittered
by
this
incident
eight
years
afterwards
they
were
members
of
the
coalition
ministry
by
which
confederation
was
brought
about
and
brown
intimate
friend
alexander
mackenzie
says
that
the
association
was
most
distasteful
to
brown
on
account
of
the
charges
made
in
connection
with
the
prison
commission
that
the
leaders
of
the
two
parties
were
not
merely
political
opponents
but
personal
enemies
must
have
embittered
the
party
struggle
and
it
was
certainly
waged
on
both
sides
with
fury
and
with
little
regard
either
for
the
amenities
of
life
or
for
fair
play
his
work
on
the
commission
gave
brown
a
strong
interest
in
prison
reform
while
the
work
of
the
commission
was
fresh
in
his
mind
he
delivered
an
address
in
the
toronto
mechanics
institute
in
which
he
sketched
the
history
of
prison
reform
in
england
and
the
united
states
and
pointed
out
how
backward
canada
was
in
this
phase
of
civilization
he
pleaded
for
a
more
charitable
treatment
of
those
on
whom
the
prison
doors
had
closed
there
were
inmates
of
prisons
who
would
stand
guiltless
in
the
presence
of
him
who
searches
the
heart
there
were
guilty
ones
outside
we
can
not
he
said
expect
human
justice
to
be
infallible
but
we
must
not
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
between
the
world
inside
the
prison
and
the
world
outside
as
if
the
courts
of
justice
had
the
divine
power
of
judging
between
good
and
evil
in
canada
he
said
we
have
no
system
of
reforming
the
prisoner
even
the
chaplain
or
the
teacher
never
enters
the
prison
walls
children
of
eight
and
ten
years
of
age
are
placed
in
our
gaols
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
the
worst
criminals
in
the
province
he
went
on
to
describe
some
of
the
evils
of
herding
together
hardened
criminals
children
and
persons
charged
with
trifling
offences
he
advocated
government
inspection
of
prisons
a
uniform
system
of
discipline
strict
classification
and
separation
secular
and
religious
instruction
and
the
teaching
of
trades
the
prisoner
should
be
punished
but
not
made
to
feel
that
he
was
being
degraded
by
society
for
the
sake
of
revenge
hope
should
be
held
out
to
those
who
showed
repentance
the
use
of
the
lash
for
trifling
offences
against
discipline
was
condemned
on
the
whole
his
views
were
such
as
are
now
generally
accepted
and
he
may
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
pioneers
of
prison
reform
in
canada
the
habit
of
personal
attack
was
further
illustrated
in
the
charge
frequently
made
by
brown
enemies
that
he
had
been
a
defaulter
in
scotland
the
had
printed
this
accusation
during
its
fierce
altercation
with
the
but
the
editor
macdougall
had
afterwards
apologized
and
explained
that
it
had
crept
into
the
paper
during
his
absence
and
without
his
knowledge
in
the
session
of
a
powell
member
for
carleton
renewed
the
attack
in
the
house
and
brown
made
a
reply
of
such
compelling
human
interest
that
not
a
word
can
be
added
or
taken
away
he
said
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
insinuation
has
been
made
that
i
was
a
defaulter
in
my
native
city
it
has
been
echoed
before
now
from
the
organs
of
the
ministry
and
at
many
an
election
contest
have
i
been
compelled
to
sit
patiently
and
hear
the
tale
recounted
in
the
ears
of
assembled
hundreds
for
fifteen
years
i
have
been
compelled
to
bear
in
silence
these
imputations
i
would
that
i
could
yet
refrain
from
the
painful
theme
but
the
pointed
and
public
manner
in
which
the
charge
has
now
been
made
and
the
fear
that
the
public
cause
with
which
i
am
identified
might
suffer
by
my
silence
alike
tell
me
that
the
moment
has
come
when
i
ought
to
explain
the
transaction
as
i
have
always
been
able
to
explain
it
and
to
cast
back
the
vile
charge
of
dishonesty
on
those
who
dared
to
make
it
that
my
father
was
a
merchant
in
the
city
of
edinburgh
and
that
he
engaged
in
disastrous
business
speculations
commencing
in
the
inflated
times
of
and
terminating
ten
years
afterwards
in
his
failure
is
undoubtedly
true
and
it
is
unhappily
also
true
that
he
did
hold
a
public
office
and
that
funds
connected
with
that
office
were
at
the
moment
of
his
sequestration
mixed
up
with
his
private
funds
to
the
extent
i
believe
of
two
thousand
eight
hundred
pounds
for
this
sum
four
relatives
and
friends
were
sureties
and
they
paid
the
money
part
of
that
money
has
been
repaid
every
sixpence
of
it
will
be
paid
and
paid
shortly
property
has
been
long
set
aside
for
the
payment
of
that
debt
to
its
utmost
farthing
my
father
felt
that
while
that
money
remained
unpaid
there
was
a
brand
on
himself
and
his
family
and
he
has
wrought
wrought
as
few
men
have
wrought
to
pay
off
not
only
that
but
other
obligations
of
a
sacred
character
many
a
bill
of
exchange
the
proceeds
of
his
labour
has
he
sent
to
old
creditors
who
were
in
need
of
what
he
owed
for
myself
sir
i
have
felt
equally
bound
with
my
father
as
his
eldest
son
i
felt
that
the
fruits
of
my
industry
should
stand
pledged
until
every
penny
of
those
debts
was
paid
and
the
honour
of
my
family
vindicated
an
honourable
member
opposite
whom
i
regret
to
hear
cheering
on
the
person
who
made
the
attack
might
have
known
that
under
the
legal
advice
of
his
relative
i
long
ago
secured
that
in
the
event
of
my
death
before
the
accomplishment
of
our
purpose
after
the
payment
of
my
own
obligations
the
full
discharge
of
those
sacred
debts
of
my
father
should
stand
as
a
first
charge
on
my
ample
estate
debts
sir
which
i
was
no
more
bound
in
law
to
pay
than
any
gentleman
who
hears
me
for
the
painful
transaction
to
which
i
have
been
forced
to
allude
i
am
no
more
responsible
than
any
gentleman
in
this
assembly
it
happened
in
i
was
at
that
time
but
seventeen
years
of
age
i
was
totally
unconnected
with
it
but
young
as
i
was
i
felt
then
as
i
feel
now
the
obligation
it
laid
upon
me
and
i
vowed
that
i
should
never
rest
until
every
penny
had
been
paid
there
are
those
present
who
have
known
my
every
action
since
i
set
foot
in
this
country
they
know
i
have
not
eaten
the
bread
of
idleness
but
they
did
not
know
the
great
object
of
my
labour
the
one
end
of
my
desire
for
wealth
was
that
i
might
discharge
those
debts
and
redeem
my
father
honour
thank
god
sir
my
exertions
have
not
been
in
vain
thank
god
sir
i
have
long
possessed
property
far
more
than
sufficient
for
all
my
desires
but
as
those
gentlemen
know
it
is
one
thing
in
this
country
to
have
property
and
another
to
be
able
to
withdraw
a
large
sum
of
money
from
a
business
in
active
operation
and
many
a
night
have
i
laid
my
head
on
my
pillow
after
a
day
of
toil
estimating
and
calculating
if
the
time
had
yet
arrived
when
with
justice
to
those
to
whom
i
stood
indebted
and
without
fear
of
embarrassment
resulting
i
might
venture
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
my
life
i
have
been
accused
of
being
ambitious
i
have
been
charged
with
aspiring
to
the
office
of
prime
minister
of
this
great
country
and
of
lending
all
my
energies
to
the
attainment
of
that
end
but
i
only
wish
i
could
make
my
opponents
understand
how
infinitely
surpassing
all
this
how
utterly
petty
and
contemptible
in
my
thoughts
have
been
all
such
considerations
in
comparison
with
the
one
longing
desire
to
discharge
those
debts
of
honour
and
vindicate
those
scottish
principles
that
have
been
instilled
into
me
since
my
youth
the
honourable
member
for
cornwall
john
sandfield
macdonald
is
well
aware
that
every
word
i
have
spoken
has
been
long
ago
told
him
in
private
confidence
and
he
knows
too
that
last
summer
i
was
rejoicing
in
the
thought
that
i
was
at
last
in
a
position
to
visit
my
native
land
with
the
large
sum
necessary
for
all
the
objects
i
contemplated
and
that
i
was
only
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
financial
storm
which
swept
over
the
continent
such
sir
are
the
circumstances
upon
which
this
attack
is
founded
such
the
facts
on
which
i
have
been
denounced
as
a
public
defaulter
and
refugee
from
my
native
land
but
why
asked
the
person
who
made
the
charge
has
he
sat
silent
under
it
why
if
the
thing
is
false
has
he
endured
it
so
many
years
what
sir
free
myself
from
blame
by
inculpating
one
so
dear
say
was
not
i
who
was
in
fault
it
was
my
father
rather
would
i
have
lost
my
right
arm
than
utter
such
a
word
no
sir
i
waited
the
time
when
the
charge
could
be
met
as
it
only
might
be
fittingly
met
and
my
only
regret
even
now
is
that
i
have
been
compelled
to
speak
before
those
debts
have
been
entirely
liquidated
but
it
is
due
sir
to
my
aged
father
that
i
explain
that
it
has
not
been
with
his
will
that
these
imputations
have
been
so
long
pointed
at
me
and
that
it
has
only
been
by
earnest
remonstrance
that
i
have
prevented
his
vindicating
me
in
public
long
ere
now
no
man
in
toronto
perhaps
is
more
generally
known
in
the
community
and
i
think
i
could
appeal
even
to
his
political
opponents
to
say
if
there
is
a
citizen
of
toronto
at
this
day
more
thoroughly
respected
and
esteemed
with
a
full
knowledge
of
all
that
has
passed
and
all
the
consequences
that
have
flowed
from
a
day
of
weakness
i
will
say
that
an
honester
man
does
not
breathe
the
air
of
heaven
that
no
son
feels
prouder
of
his
father
than
i
do
and
that
i
would
have
submitted
to
the
obloquy
and
reproach
of
his
every
act
not
fifteen
years
but
fifty
ay
have
gone
down
to
the
grave

the
cold
shade

that

hairs

have

the
most
refreshing
episode

the

if
it
was
not
the
main
cause
thereof
his
party
also
made
large
gains
through
upper
canada
and
had
a
large
majority
in
that
part
of
the
province
so
that
the
majority
for
the

was
drawn
entirely
from

gross

city
where
such
names
as

appeared
on

the

attacked

without
success
but
in
the
sitting
member
for
russell
and
several
others
were
tried
for
conspiracy
convicted
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
that
the
government
felt
itself
to
be
much
weakened
throughout
the

is
evident
from
john

unsuccessful
effort
to
add
another
to
his
list

and

reformer
the
personal
attack
on
brown
in
the
session
of
has
already
been
mentioned
the
chief
political
event
of
the
session
was
the
double
shuffle
on
july
brown
succeeded
in
placing
the
ministry
in
a
minority
on
the
question
of
the
seat
of
government
unable
to
decide
between
the
conflicting
claims
of
toronto
quebec
montreal
and
kingston
the
government
referred
the
question
to
the
queen
who
decided
in
favour
of
ottawa
brown
had
opposed
the
reference
to
the
queen
holding
that
the
question
should
be
settled
in
canada
he
also
believed
that
the
seat
of
government
should
not
be
fixed
until
representation
by
population
was
granted
and
all
matters
in
dispute
between
upper
and
lower
canada
arranged
he
now
moved
against
ottawa
and
carried
his
motion
during
the
same
sitting
the
government
was
sustained
on
a
motion
to
adjourn
which
by
understanding
was
regarded
as
a
test
of
confidence
a
few
hours
later
the
ministers
met
and
decided
that
although
they
had
been
sustained
by
a
majority
of
the
house
it
behoved
them
as
the
queen
servants
to
resent
the
slight
which
had
been
offered
her
majesty
by
the
action
of
the
assembly
in
calling
in
question
her
majesty
choice
of
the
capital
the
sir
edmund
bond
head
sent
for
brown
as
the
leader
of
the
opposition
to
form
a
government
it
was
contended
by
liberals
that
he
ought
not
to
have
taken
this
step
unless
he
intended
to
give
brown
and
his
colleagues
his
full
confidence
and
support
if
he
believed
that
the
defeat
of
the
government
was
a
mere
accident
and
that
on
general
grounds
it
commanded
a
working
majority
in
the
legislature
he
ought
not
to
have
accepted
the
resignation
unless
he
intended
to
sanction
a
fresh
appeal
to
the
country
the
invitation
to
form
an
administration
was
received
by
brown
on
thursday
july
he
at
once
waited
on
the
and
obtained
permission
to
consult
his
friends
he
called
a
meeting
of
the
upper
canadian
members
of
his
party
in
both
houses
and
obtained
from
them
promises
of
cordial
support
with
dorion
he
had
an
important
interview
dorion
agreed
that
the
principle
of
representation
by
population
was
sound
but
said
that
the
people
feared
the
consequences
of
upper
canadian
preponderance
feared
that
the
peculiar
institutions
of
french
canada
would
be
swept
away
to
assure
them
representation
by
population
must
be
accompanied
by
constitutional
checks
and
safeguards
brown
and
dorion
parted
in
the
belief
that
this
could
be
arranged
they
believed
also
that
they
could
agree
upon
an
educational
policy
in
which
religious
instruction
could
be
given
without
the
evils
of
separation
though
brown
power
did
not
lie
in
the
manipulation
of
combinations
of
men
he
succeeded
on
this
occasion
in
enlisting
the
services
of
colleagues
of
high
character
and
capacity
including
besides
dorion
oliver
mowat
john
sandfield
macdonald
luther
holton
and
drummond
on
saturday
morning
brown
waited
upon
the
and
informed
him
that
having
consulted
his
friends
and
obtained
the
aid
of
dorion
he
was
prepared
to
undertake
the
task
of
forming
an
administration
during
the
day
the
formation
of
the
ministry
was
completed
at
nine
on
sunday
night
to
give
the
story
in
brown
words
learning
that
dorion
was
ill
i
went
to
see
him
at
his
apartments
at
the
rossin
house
and
while
with
him
the
secretary
entered
and
handed
me
a
despatch
no
sooner
did
i
see
the
outside
of
the
document
than
i
understood
it
all
i
felt
at
once
that
the
whole
corruptionist
camp
had
been
in
commotion
at
the
prospect
of
the
whole
of
the
public
departments
being
subjected
to
the
investigations
of
a
second
public
accounts
committee
and
comprehended
at
once
that
the
transmission
of
such
a
despatch
could
have
but
the
one
intention
of
raising
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
new
cabinet
taking
office
and
i
was
not
mistaken
the
despatch
declared
that
the
gave
no
pledge
express
or
implied
with
reference
to
dissolution
when
advice
was
tendered
on
the
subject
he
would
act
as
he
deemed
best
it
then
laid
down
with
much
detail
the
terms
on
which
he
would
consent
to
prorogation
bills
for
the
registration
of
voters
and
for
the
prohibition
of
fraudulent
assignments
and
gifts
by
leaders
should
be
enacted
and
certain
supplies
obtained
brown
criticized
both
these
declarations
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
to
say
that
he
gave
no
pledge
in
regard
to
dissolution
to
demand
such
a
pledge
would
have
been
utterly
unconstitutional
the
governor
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
he
would
deal
with
the
proposal
when
it
was
made
by
his
advisers
but
while
he
needlessly
and
gratuitously
declared
that
he
would
not
pledge
himself
beforehand
as
to
dissolution
he
took
exactly
the
opposite
course
as
to
prorogation
specifying
almost
minutely
the
terms
on
which
he
would
consent
to
that
step
brown
contended
that
the
governor
had
no
right
to
lay
down
conditions
or
to
settle
beforehand
the
measures
that
must
be
enacted
during
the
session
this
was
an
attempt
to
dictate
not
only
to
the
ministry
but
to
the
legislature
brown
and
his
colleagues
believed
that
the
governor
was
acting
in
collusion
with
the
ministers
who
had
resigned
that
the
intriguers
were
taken
by
surprise
when
brown
showed
himself
able
to
form
a
ministry
and
that
the
sunday
communication
was
a
second
thought
a
hurriedly
devised
plan
to
bar
the
way
of
the
new
ministers
to
office
on
monday
morning
before
conferring
with
his
colleagues
brown
wrote
to
the
stating
that
his
ministry
had
been
formed
and
submitting
that
until
they
have
assumed
the
functions
of
constitutional
advisers
of
the
crown
he
and
his
proposed
colleagues
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
discuss
the
important
measures
and
questions
of
public
policy
referred
to
in
his
memorandum
brown
then
met
his
colleagues
who
unanimously
approved
of
his
answer
to
the
governor
memorandum
and
agreed
also
that
it
was
intended
as
a
bar
to
their
acceptance
of
office
they
decided
not
to
ask
for
a
pledge
as
to
dissolution
nor
to
make
or
accept
conditions
of
any
kind
we
were
willing
to
risk
our
being
turned
out
of
office
within
hours
but
we
were
not
willing
to
place
ourselves
constitutionally
in
a
false
position
we
distinctly
contemplated
all
that
sir
edmund
head
could
do
and
that
he
has
done
and
we
concluded
that
it
was
our
duty
to
accept
office
and
throw
on
the
the
responsibility
of
denying
us
the
support
we
were
entitled
to
and
which
he
had
extended
so
abundantly
to
our
predecessor
when
parliament
assembled
on
monday
a
vote
of
want
of
confidence
was
carried
against
the
new
government
in
both
houses
the
newly
appointed
ministers
had
of
course
resigned
their
seats
in
parliament
in
order
that
they
might
offer
themselves
for
it
is
true
the
majority
was
too
great
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
absence
of
the
ministers
but
the
result
was
affected
by
the
lack
not
only
of
the
votes
of
the
ministers
but
of
their
voices
in
the
absence
of
ministerial
explanation
confusion
and
misunderstanding
prevailed
the
fact
that
brown
had
been
able
to
find
common
ground
with
catholic
and
members
had
occasioned
surprise
and
anxiety
on
the
one
side
it
was
feared
that
brown
had
surrendered
to
the
and
on
the
other
that
the
had
surrendered
to
brown
the
conference
between
brown
and
dorion
shows
that
the
government
was
formed
for
the
same
purpose
as
the
coalition
of
the
settlement
of
difficulties
that
prevented
the
right
working
of
the
union
the
official
declaration
of
its
policy
contains
these
words
his
excellency
present
advisers
have
entered
the
government
with
the
fixed
determination
to
propose
constitutional
measures
for
the
establishment
of
that
harmony
between
upper
and
lower
canada
which
is
essential
to
the
prosperity
of
the
province
dissolution
was
asked
on
the
ground
that
the
new
government
intended
to
propose
important
constitutional
changes
and
that
the
parliament
did
not
represent
the
country
many
of
its
members
owing
their
seals
to
gross
fraud
and
corruption
seats
were
claimed
from
sitting
members
on
these
grounds
the
cases
of
the
quebec
and
russell
election
have
already
been
mentioned
the
member
elected
for
lotbinière
was
expelled
for
violent
interference
with
the
freedom
of
election
brown
and
his
colleagues
contended
that
these
practices
had
prevailed
to
such
an
extent
that
the
legislature
could
not
be
said
to
represent
the
country
head
reply
was
that
the
frauds
were
likely
to
be
repeated
if
a
new
election
were
held
that
they
really
afforded
a
reason
for
postponing
the
election
at
least
until
more
stringent
laws
were
enacted
the
dissolution
was
refused
the
government
resigned
and
the
old
ministers
were
restored
to
office
on
the
resignation
of
the
ministry
the
governor
called
upon
galt
who
had
given
an
independent
support
to
the
government
during
the
session
of
he
had
placed
before
the
house
resolutions
favouring
the
federal
union
of
canada
the
maritime
provinces
and
the
territory
and
it
is
possible
that
his
advocacy
of
this
policy
had
something
to
do
with
the
offer
of
the
premiership
as
yet
however
he
was
not
prominent
enough
nor
could
he
command
a
support
large
enough
to
warrant
his
acceptance
of
the
office
and
he
declined
then
followed
the
double
shuffle
the
government
resumed
office
under
the
name
of
the
government
with
galt
taking
the
place
of
cayley
and
some
minor
changes
constitutional
usage
required
that
all
the
ministers
should
have
returned
to
their
constituents
for
a
means
of
evading
this
requirement
was
found
the
statute
governing
the
case
provided
that
when
any
minister
should
resign
his
office
and
within
one
month
afterwards
accept
another
office
in
the
ministry
he
should
not
thereby
vacate
his
seat
with
the
object
of
obviating
the
necessity
for
a
new
election
cartier
macdonald
and
their
colleagues
in
order
to
bring
themselves
within
the
letter
of
the
law
although
not
within
its
spirit
exchanged
offices
each
taking
a
different
one
from
that
which
he
had
resigned
eight
days
before
shortly
before
midnight
of
the
sixth
of
august
they
solemnly
swore
to
discharge
the
duties
of
offices
which
several
of
them
had
no
intention
of
holding
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
second
shuffle
took
place
and
cartier
and
macdonald
having
been
and
for
this
brief
space
became
again
east
and
west
the
belief
of
the
reformers
that
the
was
guilty
of
partiality
and
of
intrigue
with
the
conservative
ministers
is
set
forth
as
part
of
the
history
of
the
time
there
is
evidence
of
partiality
but
no
evidence
of
intrigue
the
biographer
of
sir
john
macdonald
denies
the
charge
of
intrigue
but
says
that
macdonald
and
the
governor
were
intimate
personal
friends
dent
who
also
scouts
the
charge
of
intrigue
says
that
the
governor
was
prejudiced
against
brown
regarding
him
as
a
mere
obstructionist
the
seems
to
have
been
influenced
by
these
personal
feelings
making
everything
as
difficult
as
possible
for
brown
and
as
easy
as
possible
for
macdonald
even
to
the
point
of
acquiescing
in
the
evasion
of
the
law
known
as
the
double
shuffle
in
the
debate
on
confederation
senator
ferrier
said
that
a
political
warfare
had
been
waged
in
canada
for
many
years
of
a
nature
calculated
to
destroy
all
moral
and
political
principles
both
in
the
legislature
and
out
of
it
the
double
shuffle
is
so
typical
of
this
dreary
and
ignoble
warfare
and
it
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
political
history
of
the
time
that
it
has
been
necessary
to
describe
it
at
some
length
but
for
these
considerations
the
episode
would
have
deserved
scant
notice
the
headship
of
one
of
the
ephemeral
ministries
that
preceded
confederation
could
add
little
to
the
reputation
of
brown
his
powers
were
not
shown
at
their
best
in
office
and
the
surroundings
of
office
were
not
congenial
to
him
his
strength
lay
in
addressing
the
people
directly
through
his
paper
or
on
the
platform
and
in
the
hour
of
defeat
or
disappointment
he
turned
to
the
people
for
consolation
during
these
contests
he
said
some
years
afterwards
it
was
this
which
sustained
the
gallant
band
of
reformers
who
so
long
struggled
for
popular
rights
that
abused
as
we
might
be
we
had
this
consolation
that
we
could
not
go
anywhere
among
our
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
in
tory
constituencies
as
well
as
in
reform
constituencies
without
the
certainty
of
receiving
from
the
honest
intelligent
yeomanry
of
the
country
from
the
true
people
of
upper
canada
who
came
out
to
meet
us
the
hearty
grasp
of
the
hand
and
the
hearty
greeting
that
amply
rewarded
the
labour
we
had
expended
in
their
behalf
that
is
the
highest
reward
i
have
hoped
for
in
public
life
and
i
am
sure
that
no
man
who
earns
that
reward
will
ever
in
upper
canada
have
better
occasion
to
speak
of
the
gratitude
of
the

several
years

of

presbyterian
college
and
the
names
of
peter
brown
george
brown
and
oliver
mowat
are
found
on
the
committee
the
object
of
the
society
was
the
extinction
of
slavery
all
over
the
world
by
means
exclusively
lawful
and
peaceable
moral
and
religious
such
as
the
diffusion
of
useful
information
and
argument
by
tracts
newspapers
lectures
and
correspondence
and
by
manifesting
sympathy
with
the
houseless
and
homeless
victims
of
slavery
flying
to
our
soil
concerts
were
given
and
the
proceeds
applied
in
aid
of
the
refugees
brown
was
also
strongly
interested
in
the
settlements
of
refugees
established
throughout
western
canada
under
an
act
of
the
canadian
parliament
for
the
settlement
and
moral
improvement
of
the
coloured
population
of
canada
large
tracts
of
land
were
acquired
divided
into
fifty
acre
lots
and
sold
to
refugees
at
low
prices
payable
in
instalments
sunday
schools
and
day
schools
were
established
the
moving
spirit
in
one
of
these
settlements
was
the
rev
william
king
a
presbyterian
formerly
of
louisiana
who
had
freed
his
own
slaves
and
brought
them
to
canada
traces
of
these
settlements
still
exist
either
in
this
way
or
otherwise
there
were
large
numbers
of
coloured
people
living
in
the
valley
of
the
thames
from
chatham
to
london
in
catharines
hamilton
and
toronto
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
society
in
brown
moved
a
resolution
expressing
gratitude
to
those
american
clergymen
who
had
exposed
the
atrocities
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
he
showed
how
before
its
enactment
slaves
were
continually
escaping
to
the
northern
states
where
they
were
virtually
out
of
reach
of
their
masters
there
was
a
law
enabling
the
latter
to
recover
their
property
but
its
edge
was
dulled
by
public
opinion
in
the
north
which
was
rapidly
growing
antagonistic
to
allowing
the
free
states
to
become
a
for
the
south
took
alarm
at
the
growth
of
this
feeling
and
procured
the
passage
of
a
more
stringent
law
this
law
enabled
the
to
seize
the
slave
wherever
he
found
him
without
warrant
and
it
forbade
the
freeman
to
shelter
the
refugee
under
penalty
of
six
months
imprisonment
a
fine
of
one
thousand
dollars
and
liability
to
a
civil
suit
for
damages
to
the
same
amount
the
enforcement
of
the
law
was
given
to
federal
instead
of
to
state
officials
after
giving
several
illustrations
of
the
working
of
the
law
brown
proceeded
to
discuss
the
duty
of
canada
in
regard
to
slavery
it
was
a
question
of
humanity
of
christianity
and
of
liberty
in
which
all
men
were
interested
canada
could
not
escape
the
contamination
of
a
system
existing
so
near
her
borders
we
too
are
americans
on
us
as
well
as
on
them
lies
the
duty
of
preserving
the
honour
of
the
continent
on
us
as
on
them
rests
the
noble
trust
of
shielding
free
institutions
having
long
borne
the
blame
of
permitting
slavery
the
people
of
the
north
naturally
expected
that
when
the
great
struggle
came
they
would
receive
the
moral
support
of
the
civilized
world
in
its
effort
to
check
and
finally
to
crush
out
the
evil
they
were
shocked
and
disappointed
when
this
support
was
not
freely
and
generously
given
and
when
sympathy
with
the
south
showed
itself
strongly
in
great
britain
brown
dealt
with
this
question
in
a
speech
delivered
in
toronto
shortly
after
lincoln
proclamation
of
emancipation
he
had
just
returned
from
great
britain
and
he
said
that
in
his
six
journey
through
england
and
scotland
he
had
conversed
with
persons
in
all
conditions
of
life
and
he
was
sorry
to
say
that
general
sympathy
was
with
the
south
this
did
not
proceed
from
any
change
in
the
feeling
towards
slavery
hatred
of
slavery
was
as
strong
as
ever
but
it
was
not
believed
that
african
slavery
was
the
real
cause
of
the
war
or
that
lincoln
sincerely
desired
to
bring
the
traffic
to
an
end
this
misunderstanding
he
attributed
to
persistent
misrepresentation
there
were
men
who
rightly
understood
the
merits
of
the
contest
and
among
these
he
placed
the
members
of
the
british
ministry
the
course
of
the
ministry
he
described
as
one
of
scrupulous
neutrality
and
firm
resistance
to
the
invitations
of
other
powers
to
interfere
in
the
contest
brown
himself
never
for
a
moment
failed
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
struggle
and
he
showed
an
insight
remarkable
at
that
time
into
the
policy
of
lincoln
the
men
of
canada
he
said
had
an
important
duty
to
discharge
we
who
have
stood
here
on
the
borders
of
the
republic
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
protesting
against
slavery
as
the
sum
of
all
human
villainies
we
who
have
closely
watched
every
turn
of
the
question
we
who
have
for
years
acted
and
sympathized
with
the
good
men
of
the
republic
in
their
efforts
for
the
freedom
of
their
country
we
who
have
a
practical
knowledge
of
the
atrocities
of
the
institution
learned
from
the
lips
of
the
panting
refugee
upon
our
shores
we
who
have
in
our
ranks
men
all
known
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
as
abolitionists
we
i
say
are
in
a
position
to
speak
with
confidence
to
the
men
of
great
britain
to
tell
them
that
they
have
not
rightly
understood
this
matter
to
tell
them
that
slavery
is
the
one
great
cause
of
the
american
rebellion
and
that
the
success
of
the
north
is
the
of
slavery
strange
after
all
that
has
passed
that
a
doubt
of
this
should
remain
it
was
true
he
said
that
lincoln
was
not
elected
as
an
abolitionist
lincoln
declared
and
the
republican
party
declared
that
they
stood
by
the
constitution
that
they
would
so
far
as
the
constitution
allowed
restrict
slavery
and
prevent
its
extension
to
new
territory
yet
they
knew
that
the
constitution
gave
them
all
they
desired
well
did
they
know
and
well
did
the
southerners
know
that
any
president
and
congress
by
their
direct
power
of
legislation
by
their
control
of
the
public
patronage
and
by
the
application
of
the
public
moneys
could
not
only
restrict
slavery
within
its
present
boundaries
but
could
secure
its
ultimate
abolition
the
south
perfectly
comprehended
that
lincoln
if
elected
might
keep
within
the
letter
of
the
constitution
and
yet
sap
the
foundation
of
the
whole
slave
system
and
they
acted
accordingly
in
answering
the
question
why
did
not
the
north
let
the
slave
states
go
in
peace
brown
freely
admitted
the
right
of
revolution
the
world
no
longer
believes
in
the
divine
right
of
either
kings
or
presidents
to
govern
wrong
but
those
who
seek
to
change
an
established
government
by
force
of
arms
assume
a
fearful
responsibility
a
responsibility
which
nothing
but
the
clearest
and
most
intolerable
injustice
will
acquit
them
for
assuming
here
was
a
rebellion
not
to
resist
injustice
but
to
perpetuate
injustice
not
to
deliver
the
oppressed
from
bondage
but
to
fasten
more
hopelessly
than
ever
the
chains
of
slavery
on
four
millions
of
human
beings
why
not
let
the
slave
states
go
because
it
would
have
been
wrong
because
it
would
have
built
up
a
great
slave
power
that
no
moral
influence
could
reach
a
power
that
would
have
overawed
the
free
northern
states
added
to
its
territory
and
the
slave
trade
had
lincoln
permitted
the
slave
states
to
go
and
to
form
such
a
power
he
would
have
brought
enduring
contempt
upon
his
name
and
the
people
of
england
would
have
been
the
first
to
reproach
him
brown
argued
as
he
had
done
in
that
canada
could
not
be
indifferent
to
the
question
whether
the
dominant
power
of
the
north
american
continent
should
be
slave
or
free
holding
that
liberty
had
better
securities
under
the
british
than
under
the
american
system
he
yet
believed
that
the
failure
of
the
american
experiment
would
be
a
calamity
and
a
blow
to
free
institutions
all
over
the
world
for
years
the
united
states
had
been
the
refuge
of
the
oppressed
in
every
land
millions
had
fled
from
poverty
in
europe
to
find
happiness
and
prosperity
there
from
these
had
been
wafted
back
to
europe
new
ideas
of
the
rights
of
the
people
with
the
fall
of
the
united
states
this
impetus
to
freedom
in
its
influence
would
cease
demands
for
popular
rights
and
free
constitutions
would
be
met
by
the
despotic
rulers
of
europe
with
the
taunt
that
in
the
united
states
free
constitutions
and
popular
rights
had
ended
in
disruption
and
anarchy
let
us
not
forget
that
there
have
been
and
still
are
very
different
monarchies
in
the
world
from
that
of
our
own
beloved
queen
and
assuredly
there
are
not
so
many
free
governments
on
earth
that
we
should
hesitate
to
devise
earnestly
the
success
of
that
one
nearest
to
our
own
modelled
from
our
own
and
founded
by
men
of
our
own
race
i
do
most
heartily
rejoice
for
the
cause
of
liberty
that
lincoln
did
not
patiently
acquiesce
in
the
dismemberment
of
the
republic
the
civil
war
in
the
united
states
raised
the
most
important
question
of
foreign
policy
with
which
the
public
men
of
canada
were
called
upon
to
deal
in
brown
career
the
dismemberment
of
the
british
empire
would
hardly
have
exercised
a
more
profound
influence
on
the
human
race
and
on
aspirations
for
freedom
than
the
dismemberment
of
the
united
states
and
the
establishment
on
this
continent
of
a
mighty
slave
empire
canada
could
not
be
indifferent
to
the
issue
how
long
would
the
power
which
coerced
the
north
into
consenting
to
the
fugitive
slave
law
have
tolerated
the
existence
of
a
free
refuge
for
slaves
across
the
lakes
either
canada
would
have
been
forced
to
submit
to
the
humiliation
of
joining
in
the
hunt
for
men
or
the
british
empire
would
have
been
obliged
to
fight
the
battle
that
the
north
fought
under
the
leadership
of
lincoln
in
the
face
of
this
danger
confronting
canada
and
the
empire
and
freedom
it
was
a
time
to
forget
smaller
international
animosities
brown
was
one
of
the
few
canadian
statesmen
who
saw
the
situation
clearly
and
rose
to
the
occasion
for
twenty
years
by
his
public
speeches
and
still
more
through
the
generous
devotion
of
the
to
the
cause
he
aided
the
cause
of
freedom
and
of
the
union
of
the
lovers
of
freedom
chapter
xii
brown
and
the
roman
catholics
that
the
and
brown
as
related
in
a
previous
chapter
became
associated
with
lord
john
russell
bill
and
the
no
popery
agitation
in
england
may
be
regarded
as
a
mere
accident
the
excitement
would
have
died
out
here
as
it
died
out
in
england
if
there
had
not
been
in
canada
such
a
mass
of
inflammable
material
so
many
questions
in
which
the
relations
of
church
and
state
were
involved
one
of
these
was
state
endowment
of
denominational
schools
during
brown
early
years
in
canada
the
school
system
was
being
placed
on
a
broad
and
popular
basis
salaries
of
teachers
were
wretchedly
low
fees
were
charged
to
children
and
remitted
only
as
an
act
of
charity
brown
advocated
a
free
and
unsectarian
system
claims
for
denominational
schools
were
put
forward
not
only
by
the
roman
catholics
but
by
the
anglicans
he
argued
that
if
this
were
allowed
the
public
school
system
would
be
destroyed
by
division
the
country
could
barely
afford
to
maintain
one
good
school
system
to
maintain
a
system
for
each
denomination
would
require
an
immense
addition
to
the
number
of
and
teachers
and
would
absorb
the
whole
revenue
of
the
province
at
the
same
time
the
educational
forces
would
be
weakened
by
the
division
and
thousands
of
children
would
grow
up
without
education
under
the
system
said
brown
the
day
is
at
hand
when
we
may
hope
to
abolish
the
and
offer
free
education
to
every
child
in
the
province
eventually
it
was
found
possible
to
carry
out
brown
idea
of
free
education
for
every
child
in
the
province
and
yet
to
allow
roman
catholic
separate
schools
to
be
maintained
to
this
compromise
brown
became
reconciled
because
it
did
not
involve
as
he
had
feared
the
destruction
of
the
free
school
system
by
division
the
roman
catholics
of
upper
canada
were
allowed
to
maintain
separate
denominational
schools
to
have
them
supported
by
the
taxes
of
roman
catholic
ratepayers
and
by
provincial
grants
so
far
as
the
education
of
protestant
children
was
concerned
brown
advocacy
was
successful
he
opposed
denominational
schools
because
he
feared
they
would
weaken
or
destroy
the
general
system
of
free
education
for
all
under
the
agreement
which
was
finally
arrived
at
this
fear
was
not
realized
in
his
speech
on
confederation
he
admitted
that
the
sectarian
system
carried
to
a
limited
extent
and
confined
chiefly
to
cities
and
towns
had
not
been
a
very
great
practical
injury
the
real
cause
of
alarm
was
that
the
admission
of
the
sectarian
principle
was
there
and
that
at
any
moment
it
might
be
extended
to
such
a
degree
as
to
split
up
our
school
system
altogether
that
the
separate
system
might
gradually
extend
itself
until
the
whole
country
was
studded
with
nurseries
of
sectarianism
most
hurtful
to
the
best
interests
of
the
province
and
entailing
an
enormous
expense
to
sustain
the
hosts
of
teachers
that
so
prodigal
a
system
of
public
instruction
must
inevitably
entail
this
however
was
not
the
only
question
at
issue
between
brown
and
the
roman
catholic
church
it
happened
as
has
been
said
above
that
on
his
first
entry
into
parliament
the
place
of
meeting
was
the
city
of
quebec
the
man
found
himself
in
a
roman
catholic
city
surrounded
by
every
evidence
of
the
power
of
the
church
as
he
looked
up
from
the
floor
of
the
house
to
the
galleries
he
saw
a
catholic
audience
its
character
emphasized
by
the
appearance
of
priests
clad
in
the
distinctive
garments
of
their
orders
it
was
his
duty
to
oppose
a
great
mass
of
legislation
intended
to
strengthen
that
church
and
to
add
to
its
privileges
his
spirit
rose
and
he
grew
more
dour
and
resolute
as
he
realized
the
strength
of
the
forces
opposed
to
him
it
would
be
doing
an
injustice
to
the
memory
of
brown
to
gloss
over
or
minimize
a
most
important
feature
of
his
career
or
to
offer
apologies
which
he
himself
would
have
despised
the
battle
was
not
fought
with
swords
of
lath
and
whoever
wants
to
read
of
an
no
popery
fight
carried
on
with
abounding
fire
and
vigour
will
find
plenty
of
matter
in
the
files
of
the
of
the
fifties
his
success
in
the
election
of
so
far
as
upper
canada
was
concerned
and
especially
his
accomplishment
of
the
rare
feat
of
carrying
a
toronto
seat
for
the
reform
party
was
largely
due
to
an
agitation
that
aroused
all
the
forces
and
many
of
the
prejudices
of
protestantism
yet
brown
kept
and
won
many
warm
friends
among
roman
catholics
both
in
upper
and
in
lower
canada
his
manliness
attracted
them
they
saw
in
him
not
a
and
bigot
seeking
to
force
his
opinions
on
others
but
a
brave
and
generous
man
fighting
for
principles
and
in
lower
canada
there
were
many
roman
catholic
laymen
whose
hearts
were
with
him
and
who
were
themselves
entering
upon
a
momentous
struggle
to
free
the
electorate
from
clerical
control
in
his
fight
for
the
separation
of
church
and
state
he
came
into
conflict
not
with
roman
catholics
alone
in
his
own
presbyterian
church
at
the
time
of
the
disruption
he
strongly
upheld
the
side
which
was
identified
with
liberty
for
several
years
after
his
arrival
in
canada
he
was
fighting
against
the
special
privileges
of
the
anglican
church
he
often
said
that
he
was
actuated
not
by
prejudice
against
one
church
but
by
hatred
of
clerical
privilege
and
love
of
religious
liberty
and
equality
in
brown
in
a
letter
addressed
to
prominent
roman
catholics
gave
a
account
of
his
relations
with
the
roman
catholic
church
it
is
repeated
here
in
a
somewhat
abbreviated
form
but
as
nearly
as
possible
in
his
own
words
in
the
early
days
of
the
political
history
of
upper
canada
the
great
mass
of
catholics
were
staunch
reformers
they
suffered
from
downing
street
rule
from
the
domination
of
the
family
compact
from
the
clergy
reserves
and
from
other
attempts
to
arm
the
anglican
church
with
special
privileges
and
powers
they
gave
an
intelligent
and
cordial
support
to
liberal
and
progressive
measures
they
contributed
to
the
victory
of
baldwin
and
lafontaine
but
when
that
victory
was
achieved
the
upper
canadian
reformers
found
that
a
cause
was
operating
to
deprive
them
of
its
fruits
the
members
of
the
cabinet
and
their
supporters
in
parliament
blocked
the
way
they
not
only
prevented
or
delayed
the
measures
which
the
reformers
desired
but
they
forced
through
parliament
measures
which
antagonized
reform
sentiment
although
much
less
numerous
than
the
people
of
upper
canada
and
contributing
to
the
common
purse
hardly
a
fourth
of
the
annual
revenue
of
the
united
provinces
the
lower
canadians
sent
an
equal
number
of
representatives
with
the
upper
canadians
to
parliament
and
by
their
unity
of
action
obtained
complete
dominancy
in
the
management
of
public
affairs
unjust
and
injurious
taxation
waste
and
extravagance
and
great
increases
in
the
public
debt
followed
seeking
a
remedy
the
upper
canadian
reformers
demanded
first
representation
by
population
giving
upper
canada
its
just
influence
in
the
legislature
and
second
the
entire
separation
of
church
and
state
placing
all
denominations
on
a
like
footing
and
leaving
each
to
support
its
own
religious
establishments
from
the
funds
of
its
own
people
they
believed
that
these
measures
would
remove
from
the
public
arena
causes
of
strife
and
heartburning
and
would
bring
about
solid
prosperity
and
internal
peace
the
battle
was
fought
vigorously
the
most
determined
efforts
were
put
forth
for
the
final
but
just
settlement
of
all
those
vexed
questions
by
which
religious
sects
were
arrayed
against
each
other
clergymen
were
dragged
as
combatants
into
the
political
arena
religion
was
brought
into
contempt
and
opportunity
presented
to
our
friends
to
rule
us
through
our
own
dissensions
clergy
reserves
sectarian
schools
the
use
of
the
public
funds
for
sectarian
purposes
were
assailed
on
these
and
many
similar
questions
we
were
met
by
the
phalanx
in
hostile
array
our
whole
policy
was
denounced
in
language
of
the
strongest
character
and
the
men
who
upheld
it
were
assailed
as
the
basest
of
mankind
we
on
our
part
were
not
slow
in
returning
blow
for
blow
and
feelings
were
excited
among
the
catholics
from
upper
canada
that
estranged
the
great
bulk
of
them
from
our
ranks
the
agitation
was
carried
on
however
until
the
grievances
of
which
the
reformers
complained
were
removed
by
the
act
of
confederation
under
that
act
the
people
of
ontario
enjoy
representation
according
to
population
they
have
entire
control
over
their
own
local
affairs
and
the
last
remnant
of
the
sectarian
warfare
the
separate
school
question
was
settled
forever
by
a
compromise
that
was
accepted
as
final
by
all
parties
concerned
in
this
letter
brown
said
that
he
was
not
seeking
to
cloak
over
past
feuds
or
apologize
for
past
occurrences
he
gloried
in
the
justice
and
soundness
of
the
principles
and
measures
for
which
he
and
his
party
had
contended
and
he
was
proud
of
the
results
of
the
conflict
he
asked
catholics
to
read
calmly
the
page
of
history
he
had
unfolded
let
them
blaze
away
at
george
brown
afterwards
as
vigorously
as
they
please
but
let
not
their
old
feuds
with
him
close
their
eyes
to
the
interests
of
their
country
and
their
own
interests
as
a
powerful
section
of
the
body
politic
the
censure
applied
to
those
who
wantonly
draw
sectarian
questions
into
politics
and
set
catholic
against
protestant
is
just
but
it
does
not
attach
to
those
who
attack
the
privileges
of
any
church
and
who
when
the
church
steps
into
the
political
arena
strike
at
it
with
political
weapons
this
was
brown
position
he
was
the
sworn
foe
of
clericalism
he
had
no
affinity
with
the
demagogues
and
professional
agitators
who
make
a
business
of
attacking
the
roman
catholic
church
nor
with
those
whose
souls
are
filled
with
vague
alarms
of
papal
supremacy
and
who
believe
stories
of
catholics
drilling
in
churches
to
fight
their
protestant
neighbours
he
fought
against
real
tyranny
for
the
removal
of
real
grievances
when
he
believed
that
he
had
found
in
confederation
the
real
remedy
he
was
satisfied
and
he
did
not
keep
up
an
agitation
merely
for
agitation
sake
it
is
not
necessary
to
attempt
to
justify
every
word
that
may
have
been
struck
off
in
the
heat
of
a
great
conflict
there
was
a
battle
to
be
fought
he
fought
with
all
the
energy
of
his
nature
and
with
the
weapons
that
lay
at
hand
he
would
have
shared
hotspur
contempt
for
the
fop
who
vowed
that
but
for
these
vile
guns
he
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
chapter
xiii
moving
towards
confederation
to
whom
is
due
the
confederation
of
the
british
north
american
provinces
is
a
long
vexed
question
the
hon
mcgee
in
his
speech
on
confederation
gave
credit
to
uniacke
a
leading
politician
of
nova
scotia
who
in
submitted
a
scheme
of
colonial
union
to
the
imperial
authorities
to
sewell
to
sir
john
beverley
robinson
to
lord
durham
to
hamilton
a
nova
scotia
writer
and
to
alexander
morris
then
member
for
south
lanark
who
had
advocated
the
project
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
but
he
added
whatever
the
private
writer
in
his
closet
may
have
conceived
whatever
even
the
individual
statesman
may
have
designed
so
long
as
the
public
mind
was
uninterested
in
the
adoption
even
in
the
discussion
of
a
change
in
our
position
so
momentous
as
this
the
union
of
these
separate
provinces
the
individual
laboured
in
vain
perhaps
not
wholly
in
vain
for
although
his
work
may
not
have
borne
fruit
then
it
was
kindling
a
fire
that
would
ultimately
light
up
the
whole
political
horizon
and
herald
the
dawn
of
a
better
day
for
our
country
and
our
people
events
stronger
than
advocacy
events
stronger
than
men
have
come
in
at
last
like
the
fire
behind
the
invisible
writing
to
bring
out
the
truth
of
these
writings
and
to
impress
them
upon
the
mind
of
every
thoughtful
man
who
has
considered
the
position
and
probable
future
of
these
scattered
provinces
following
mcgee
suggestion
let
us
try
to
deal
with
the
question
from
the
time
that
it
ceased
to
be
speculative
and
became
practical
and
especially
to
trace
its
development
in
the
mind
of
one
man
in
the
later
fifties
brown
was
pursuing
a
course
which
led
almost
with
certainty
to
the
goal
of
confederation
the
people
of
upper
canada
were
steadily
coming
over
to
his
belief
that
they
were
suffering
injustice
under
the
union
that
they
paid
more
than
their
share
of
the
taxes
and
yet
that
lower
canadian
influence
was
dominant
in
legislation
and
in
the
formation
of
ministries
brown
tremendous
agitation
convinced
them
that
the
situation
was
intolerable
but
it
was
long
before
the
true
remedy
was
perceived
the
would
not
agree
to
brown
remedy
of
representation
by
population
brown
opposed
as
reactionary
the
proposal
that
the
union
should
be
dissolved
he
desired
not
to
go
back
to
the
day
of
small
things
on
the
contrary
even
at
this
early
day
he
was
advocating
the
union
of
the
western
territories
with
canada
nor
was
he
at
first
in
favour
of
the
federal
principle
in
in
a
formal
statement
of
its
programme
the
advocated
uniform
legislation
for
the
two
provinces
and
a
reform
convention
held
at
toronto
in
recommended
the
same
measure
together
with
representation
by
population
and
the
addition
of
the
territories
to
canada
in
january
brown
wrote
to
his
friend
luther
holton
in
a
manner
which
showed
an
open
mind
no
honest
man
can
desire
that
we
should
remain
as
we
are
and
what
other
way
out
of
our
difficulties
can
be
suggested
but
a
general
legislative
union
with
representation
by
population
a
federal
union
or
a
dissolution
of
the
present
union
i
am
sure
that
a
dissolution
cry
would
be
as
ruinous
to
any
party
as
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
wrong
a
federal
union
it
appears
to
me
can
not
be
entertained
for
canada
alone
but
when
agitated
must
include
all
british
america
we
will
be
past
caring
for
politics
when
that
measure
is
finally
achieved
what
powers
should
be
given
to
the
provincial
legislatures
and
what
to
the
federal
would
you
abolish
county
councils
and
yet
if
you
did
not
what
would
the
local
parliaments
have
to
control
would
montreal
like
to
be
put
under
the
generous
rule
of
the
quebec
politicians
our
friends
here
are
prepared
to
consider
dispassionately
any
scheme
that
may
issue
from
your
party
in
lower
canada
they
all
feel
keenly
that
something
must
be
done
their
plan
is
representation
by
population
and
a
fair
trial
for
the
present
union
in
its
integrity
failing
this
they
are
prepared
to
go
for
dissolution
i
believe
but
if
you
can
suggest
a
federal
or
any
other
scheme
that
could
be
worked
it
will
have
our
most
anxious
examination
can
you
sketch
a
plan
of
federation
such
as
our
friends
below
would
agree
to
and
could
carry
probably
dorion
and
other
lower
canadians
had
a
part
in
converting
brown
to
federation
in
dorion
had
moved
a
resolution
favouring
the
confederation
of
the
two
canadas
in
august
brown
and
dorion
undertook
to
form
a
government
pledged
to
the
settlement
of
the
question
that
had
arisen
between
upper
and
lower
canada
dorion
says
it
was
agreed
by
the
government
that
the
constitutional
question
should
be
taken
up
and
settled
either
by
a
confederation
of
the
two
provinces
or
by
representation
according
to
population
with
such
checks
and
guarantees
as
would
secure
the
religious
faith
the
laws
the
language
and
the
peculiar
institutions
of
each
section
of
the
country
from
encroachments
on
the
part
of
the
other
at
the
same
time
an
effort
in
the
same
direction
was
made
by
the
conservative
party
galt
in
the
session
of
advocated
the
federal
union
of
all
the
british
north
american
provinces
he
declared
that
unless
a
union
were
effected
the
provinces
would
inevitably
drift
into
the
united
states
he
proposed
that
questions
relating
to
education
and
likely
to
arouse
religious
dissension
ought
to
be
left
to
the
provinces
the
resolutions
moved
by
galt
in
give
him
a
high
place
among
the
promoters
of
confederation
galt
was
asked
by
sir
edmund
head
to
form
an
administration
on
the
resignation
of
the
brown
government
galt
refused
but
when
he
subsequently
entered
the
cartier
government
it
was
on
condition
that
the
promotion
of
federal
union
should
be
embodied
in
the
policy
of
the
government
cartier
ross
and
galt
visited
england
in
fulfilment
of
this
promise
and
described
the
serious
difficulties
that
had
arisen
in
canada
the
movement
failed
because
the
of
the
maritime
provinces
could
not
be
obtained
in
the
autumn
of
two
important
steps
leading
towards
federation
were
taken
in
october
the
lower
canadian
members
of
the
opposition
met
in
montreal
and
declared
for
a
federal
union
of
the
canadas
they
went
so
far
as
to
specify
the
subjects
of
federal
and
local
jurisdiction
allowing
to
the
central
authority
the
customs
tariff
the
patents
and
copyrights
and
the
currency
and
to
the
local
legislatures
education
the
laws
of
property
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
control
of
the
militia
in
september
a
meeting
of
the
liberal
members
of
both
houses
was
held
at
toronto
and
a
circular
calling
a
convention
of
upper
canadian
reformers
was
issued
it
declared
that
the
financial
and
political
evils
of
the
provinces
have
reached
such
a
point
as
to
demand
a
thorough
reconsideration
of
the
relations
between
upper
and
lower
canada
and
the
adoption
of
constitutional
changes
framed
to
remedy
the
great
abuses
that
have
arisen
under
the
present
system
that
the
nature
of
the
changes
had
been
discussed
but
that
it
was
felt
that
before
coming
to
a
conclusion
the
whole
liberal
party
throughout
upper
canada
should
be
consulted
the
discussion
would
be
free
and
unfettered
supporters
of
the
opposition
advocating
a
written
constitution
or
a
dissolution
of
the
union
or
a
federal
union
of
all
the
british
north
american
provinces
or
a
federal
system
for
canada
alone
or
any
other
plan
calculated
in
their
opinion
to
meet
the
existing
evils
are
all
equally
welcome
to
the
convention
the
one
sole
object
is
to
discuss
the
whole
subject
with
candour
and
without
prejudice
that
the
best
remedy
may
be
found
then
came
an
account
of
the
grievances
for
which
a
remedy
was
sought
the
position
of
upper
canada
at
this
moment
is
truly
anomalous
and
alarming
with
a
population
much
more
numerous
than
that
of
lower
canada
and
contributing
to
the
general
revenue
a
much
larger
share
of
taxation
than
the
sister
province
upper
canada
finds
herself
without
power
in
the
administration
of
the
affairs
of
the
union
with
a
constitution
professedly
based
on
the
principle
that
the
will
of
the
majority
should
prevail
a
minority
of
the
people
of
upper
canada
by
combination
with
the
lower
canada
majority
are
enabled
to
rule
the
upper
province
in
direct
hostility
to
the
popular
will
extravagant
expenditures
and
hurtful
legislative
measures
are
forced
on
us
in
defiance
of
the
protests
of
large
majorities
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
the
most
needful
reforms
are
denied
and
offices
of
honour
and
emolument
are
conferred
on
persons
destitute
of
popular
sympathy
and
without
qualification
beyond
that
of
unhesitating
subserviency
to
the
men
who
misgovern
the
country
the
convention
of
nearly
six
hundred
delegates
gave
evidence
of
a
genuine
popular
movement
for
constitutional
changes
though
it
was
composed
of
members
of
only
one
party
its
discussions
were
of
general
interest
and
were
upon
a
high
level
of
intelligence
and
public
spirit
the
convention
was
divided
between
dissolution
and
federal
union
federation
first
got
the
ear
of
the
meeting
free
access
to
the
sea
by
the
lawrence
free
trade
between
upper
and
lower
canada
were
urged
as
reasons
for
continuing
the
union
oliver
mowat
made
a
closely
reasoned
speech
on
the
same
side
representation
by
population
alone
would
not
be
accepted
by
lower
canada
dissolution
was
impracticable
and
could
not
at
best
be
obtained
without
long
agitation
federation
would
give
all
the
advantages
of
dissolution
without
its
difficulties
mowat
speech
was
received
with
much
favour
and
the
current
had
set
strongly
for
federation
when
george
sheppard
arose
as
the
chief
advocate
of
dissolution
sheppard
had
been
an
editorial
writer
on
the
had
been
attracted
by
brown
and
his
policy
and
had
joined
the
staff
of
the
his
main
argument
was
that
the
central
government
under
federation
would
be
a
costly
and
elaborate
affair
and
would
ultimately
overshadow
the
governments
of
the
provinces
there
would
be
a
central
parliament
a
viceroy
with
all
the
expense
of
a
court
a
federal
government
without
federal
dignity
would
be
all
moonshine
there
was
an
inherent
tendency
in
central
bodies
to
acquire
increased
power
in
the
united
states
a
federal
party
had
advocated
a
strong
central
government
and
excuses
were
always
being
sought
to
add
to
its
glory
and
influence
on
the
other
side
was
a
democratic
party
championing
state
rights
in
canada
too
we
may
expect
to
see
federation
followed
by
the
rise
of
two
parties
one
fighting
for
a
strong
central
government
the
other
like
brown
contending
for
state
rights
local
control
and
the
limited
authority
of
the
central
power
one
of
the
arguments
for
federation
was
that
it
provided
for
bringing
in
the
territory
that
implied
an
expensive
federal
government
for
the
purpose
of
organizing
the
new
territory
building
its
roads
etc
is
this
federation
he
asked
proposed
as
a
step
towards
nationality
if
so
i
am
with
you
federation
implies
nationality
for
colonial
purposes
only
it
would
be
a
needless
incumbrance
this
speech
with
its
accurate
forecast
of
the
growth
of
the
central
power
produced
such
an
impression
that
the
federalists
amended
their
resolution
and
proposed
instead
of
a
general
government
some
joint
authority
for
federal
purposes
this
concession
was
made
by
william
macdougall
one
of
the
secretaries
and
chief
figures
of
the
convention
who
said
that
he
had
been
much
impressed
by
eloquence
and
logic
the
creation
of
a
powerful
elaborate
and
expensive
central
government
such
as
now
exists
did
not
form
part
of
the
plans
of
the
liberals
either
in
upper
or
lower
canada
at
that
time
brown
who
spoke
towards
the
close
of
the
convention
declared
that
he
had
no
morbid
fear
of
dissolution
of
the
union
but
preferred
the
plan
of
federation
as
giving
upper
canada
the
advantage
of
free
trade
with
lower
canada
and
the
free
navigation
of
the
lawrence
one
of
his
most
forcible
passages
was
an
answer
to
sheppard
question
whether
the
federation
was
a
step
towards
nationality
i
do
place
the
question
on
grounds
of
nationality
i
do
hope
there
is
not
one
canadian
in
this
assembly
who
does
not
look
forward
with
high
hope
to
the
day
when
these
northern
countries
shall
stand
out
among
the
nations
of
the
world
as
one
great
confederation
what
true
canadian
can
witness
the
tide
of
emigration
now
commencing
to
flow
into
the
vast
territories
of
the
without
longing
to
have
a
share
in
the
first
settlement
of
that
great
fertile
country
who
does
not
feel
that
to
us
rightfully
belong
the
right
and
the
duty
of
carrying
the
blessings
of
civilization
throughout
those
boundless
regions
and
making
our
own
country
the
highway
of
traffic
to
the
pacific
but
is
it
necessary
that
all
this
should
be
accomplished
at
once
is
it
not
true
wisdom
to
commence
federation
with
our
own
country
and
leave
it
open
to
extension
hereafter
if
time
and
experience
shall
prove
it
desirable
and
shall
we
not
then
have
better
control
over
the
terms
of
federation
than
if
all
were
made
parties
to
the
original
compact
and
how
can
there
be
the
slightest
question
with
one
who
longs
for
such
a
nationality
between
dissolution
and
the
scheme
of
the
day
is
it
not
clear
that
the
former
would
be
the
death
blow
to
the
hope
of
future
union
while
the
latter
will
readily
furnish
the
machinery
for
a
great
federation
the
resolutions
adopted
by
the
convention
declared
that
the
legislative
union
because
of
antagonisms
developed
through
differences
of
origin
local
interests
and
other
causes
could
no
longer
be
maintained
that
the
plan
known
as
the
double
majority
did
not
afford
a
permanent
remedy
that
a
federal
union
of
all
the
british
north
american
colonies
was
out
of
the
range
of
remedies
for
present
evils
that
the
principle
of
representation
by
population
must
be
recognized
in
any
new
union
and
that
the
best
practical
remedy
for
the
evils
now
encountered
in
the
government
of
canada
is
to
be
found
in
the
formation
of
two
or
more
local
governments
to
which
shall
be
committed
the
control
of
all
matters
of
a
local
or
sectional
character
and
some
joint
authority
charged
with
such
matters
as
are
necessarily
common
to
both
sections
of
the
province
the
hopes
that
had
been
aroused
by
this
convention
were
disappointed
or
rather
deferred
when
brown
in
the
following
session
of
the
legislature
brought
forward
resolutions
in
the
sense
of
those
adopted
by
the
convention
he
found
coldness
and
dissension
in
his
own
party
and
the
resolutions
were
defeated
by
a
large
majority
subsequently
brown
had
a
long
illness
retired
from
the
leadership
and
spent
some
time
in
england
and
scotland
in
his
absence
the
movement
for
constitutional
change
was
stayed
but
events
stronger
than
advocacy
in
mcgee
words
were
operating
power
oscillated
between
the
conservative
and
reform
parties
and
two
general
elections
held
within
as
many
years
failed
to
solve
the
difficulty
when
federation
was
next
proposed
it
had
become
a
political
necessity
chapter
xiv
last
years
of
the
union
in
brown
contemplated
retiring
from
the
leadership
of
the
party
in
a
letter
to
mowat
he
said
that
the
enemies
of
reform
were
playing
the
game
of
exciting
personal
hostility
against
himself
and
reviving
feelings
inspired
by
the
fierce
contests
of
the
past
it
might
be
well
to
appoint
a
leader
who
would
arouse
less
personal
hostility
a
few
months
later
he
had
a
long
and
severe
illness
which
prevented
him
from
taking
his
place
in
the
legislature
during
the
session
of
and
from
displaying
his
usual
activity
in
the
general
election
of
the
summer
of
that
year
he
did
however
accept
the
hard
task
of
contesting
east
toronto
where
he
was
defeated
by
john
crawford
by
a
majority
of
one
hundred
and
brown
then
announced
that
the
defeat
had
opened
up
the
way
for
his
retirement
without
dishonour
and
that
he
would
not
seek
some
public
advantages
he
said
might
flow
from
that
decision
those
whose
interest
it
was
that
misgovernment
should
continue
would
no
longer
be
able
to
make
a
scapegoat
of
george
brown
admitting
that
he
had
used
strong
language
in
denouncing
french
domination
he
justified
his
course
as
the
only
remedy
for
the
evil
in
he
could
hardly
find
a
seconder
for
his
motion
in
favour
of
representation
by
population
in
the
election
just
closed
he
claimed
members
from
upper
canada
elected
to
stand
or
fall
by
that
measure
he
had
fought
a
ten
years
battle
without
faltering
he
advocated
opposition
to
any
ministry
of
either
party
that
would
refuse
to
settle
the
question
the
conservative
government
was
defeated
in
the
session
following
the
election
on
a
militia
bill
providing
for
the
maintenance
of
a
force
of
fifty
thousand
men
at
a
cost
of
about
one
million
dollars
the
american
civil
war
was
in
progress
the
affair
had
assumed
a
threatening
appearance
and
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
place
the
province
in
a
state
of
defence
the
bill
was
defeated
by
the
defection
of
some
supporters
of
the
government
the
event
caused
much
disappointment
in
england
and
from
this
time
forth
continual
pressure
from
that
quarter
in
regard
to
defence
was
one
of
the
forces
tending
towards
confederation
john
sandfield
macdonald
who
was
somewhat
unexpectedly
called
upon
to
form
a
ministry
was
an
enthusiastic
advocate
of
the
double
majority
by
which
he
believed
the
union
could
be
virtually
federalized
without
formal
constitutional
change
upper
canadian
ministers
were
to
transact
upper
canadian
business
and
so
with
lower
canada
the
administration
as
a
whole
managing
affairs
of
common
interest
local
legislation
was
not
to
be
forced
on
either
province
against
the
wish
of
the
representatives
the
administration
for
each
section
should
possess
the
confidence
of
a
majority
of
representatives
from
that
section
brown
strongly
opposed
the
double
majority
plan
which
he
regarded
as
a
mere
makeshift
for
reform
in
the
representation
and
he
was
in
some
doubt
whether
he
should
support
or
oppose
the
liberal
ministers
who
offered
for
he
finally
decided
after
consultation
with
his
brother
gordon
to
permit
them
to
go
in
unopposed
and
hold
them
up
to
the
mark
under
the
stimulus
of
bit
and
spur
in
july
brown
sailed
for
great
britain
and
in
september
he
wrote
holton
that
he
had
had
a
most
satisfactory
interview
with
the
duke
of
newcastle
at
the
latter
request
they
seem
to
have
talked
freely
about
canadian
politics
his
scruples
about
representation
are
entirely
gone
it
would
have
done
even
sandfield
macdonald
good
to
hear
his
ideas
on
the
absurdity
of
the
majority
whatever
small
politicians
and
the
london
may
say
you
may
depend
upon
this
that
the
government
and
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
perfectly
understand
our
position
and
have
no
thought
of
changing
the
relations
between
canada
and
the
mother
country
on
the
contrary
the
members
of
the
government
with
the
exception
of
gladstone
are
set
upon
the
intercolonial
railway
and
a
grand
transit
route
across
the
continent
he
remarked
upon
the
bitterness
of
the
british
feeling
against
the
united
states
and
said
that
he
was
perplexed
by
the
course
of
the
london
in
pandering
to
the
passions
of
the
people
the
most
important
event
of
his
visit
to
scotland
was
yet
to
come
on
november
he
married
miss
anne
nelson
daughter
of
the
publisher
thomas
nelson
a
marriage
which
was
the
beginning
of
a
most
happy
domestic
life
of
eighteen
years
this
lady
survived
him
until
may
on
his
return
to
canada
with
his
bride
brown
was
met
at
toronto
station
by
several
thousand
friends
in
reply
to
a
complimentary
address
he
said
i
have
come
back
with
strength
invigorated
with
new
and
i
trust
enlarged
views
and
with
the
most
earnest
desire
to
aid
in
advancing
the
prosperity
and
happiness
of
canada
it
has
been
seen
that
the
government
had
shelved
the
question
of
representation
by
population
and
had
committed
itself
to
the
device
of
the
double
majority
during
brown
absence
another
movement
which
he
had
strongly
resisted
had
been
gaining
ground
in
and
scott
of
ottawa
had
introduced
legislation
intended
to
strengthen
the
roman
catholic
separate
school
system
of
upper
canada
in
he
succeeded
by
accepting
certain
modifications
in
obtaining
the
support
of
ryerson
superintendent
of
education
another
important
advantage
was
that
his
bill
was
adopted
as
a
government
measure
by
the
sandfield
macdonald
ministry
the
bill
became
law
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
opposed
by
a
majority
of
the
representatives
from
upper
canada
this
was
in
direct
contravention
of
the
double
majority
resolutions
adopted
by
the
legislature
at
the
instance
of
the
government
the
premier
had
declared
that
there
should
be
a
truce
to
the
agitation
for
representation
by
population
or
for
other
constitutional
changes
that
agitation
had
been
based
upon
the
complaint
that
legislation
was
being
forced
upon
upper
canada
by
lower
canadian
votes
the
double
majority
resolutions
had
been
proposed
as
a
substitute
for
constitutional
change
in
the
case
of
the
separate
school
bill
they
were
disregarded
and
the
premier
was
severely
criticized
for
allowing
his
favourite
principle
to
be
contravened
brown
had
been
absent
in
the
sessions
of
and
and
he
did
not
enter
the
house
in
until
the
separate
school
bill
had
passed
its
second
reading
in
the
however
it
was
assailed
vigorously
one
ground
being
that
the
bill
was
not
a
finality
but
that
the
roman
catholic
church
would
continually
make
new
demands
and
encroachments
until
the
public
school
system
was
destroyed
on
this
question
of
finality
there
was
much
controversy
ryerson
always
insisted
that
there
was
an
express
agreement
that
it
was
to
be
final
on
the
roman
catholic
side
this
is
denied
at
confederation
brown
accepted
the
act
of
as
a
final
settlement
he
said
that
if
he
had
been
present
in
he
would
have
voted
against
the
bill
because
it
extended
the
facility
for
establishing
separate
schools
it
had
however
this
good
feature
that
it
was
accepted
by
the
roman
catholic
authorities
and
carried
through
parliament
as
a
final
compromise
of
the
question
in
upper
canada
he
added
i
have
not
the
slightest
hesitation
in
accepting
it
as
a
necessary
condition
of
the
union
with
confederation
therefore
we
may
regard
brown
opposition
to
separate
schools
in
upper
canada
as
ended
in
accepting
the
terms
of
confederation
he
accepted
the
separate
school
act
of
though
with
the
condition
that
it
should
be
final
a
condition
repudiated
on
the
roman
catholic
side
the
sandfield
macdonald
government
was
weakened
by
this
incident
and
it
soon
afterwards
fell
upon
a
general
vote
of
want
of
confidence
moved
by
john
macdonald
parliament
was
dissolved
and
an
election
was
held
in
the
summer
of
the
government
obtained
a
majority
in
upper
but
not
in
lower
canada
and
on
the
whole
its
tenure
of
power
was
precarious
in
the
extreme
finally
in
march
it
resigned
without
waiting
for
a
vote
of
want
of
confidence
its
successor
the
government
had
a
life
of
only
three
months
and
its
death
marks
the
birth
of
a
new
era
chapter
xv
confederation
events
stronger
than
advocacy
events
stronger
than
men
to
repeat
mcgee
phrase
combined
in
to
remove
confederation
from
the
field
of
speculation
to
the
field
of
action
for
several
years
the
british
government
had
been
urging
upon
canada
the
necessity
for
undertaking
a
greater
share
of
her
own
defence
this
view
was
expressed
with
disagreeable
candour
in
the
london
and
elsewhere
on
the
occasion
of
the
defeat
of
the
militia
bill
of
the
american
civil
war
emphasized
the
necessity
for
measures
of
defence
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
great
britain
and
the
united
states
were
on
the
verge
of
war
of
which
canada
would
have
been
the
battleground
as
the
war
progressed
the
world
was
astonished
by
the
development
of
the
military
power
of
the
republic
it
seemed
not
improbable
at
that
time
that
when
the
success
of
the
north
was
assured
its
great
armies
would
be
used
for
the
subjugation
of
canada
the
north
had
come
to
regard
canada
as
a
home
of
southern
sympathizers
and
a
place
in
which
conspiracies
against
the
republic
were
hatched
by
southerners
though
canada
was
not
to
blame
for
the
use
that
was
made
of
its
soil
yet
some
was
aroused
and
public
men
were
warranted
in
regarding
the
peril
as
real
canada
was
also
about
to
lose
a
large
part
of
its
trade
for
ten
years
that
trade
had
been
built
up
largely
on
the
basis
of
reciprocity
with
the
united
states
and
the
war
had
largely
increased
the
american
demand
for
canadian
products
it
was
generally
expected
and
that
expectation
was
fulfilled
that
the
treaty
would
be
abrogated
by
the
united
states
it
was
feared
that
the
policy
of
commercial
would
be
carried
even
farther
the
bonding
system
abolished
and
canada
cut
off
from
access
to
the
seaboard
during
the
winter
if
we
add
to
these
difficulties
the
domestic
dissensions
of
canada
we
must
recognize
that
the
outlook
was
dark
canada
was
then
a
fringe
of
settlement
extending
from
the
detroit
river
to
the
gulf
of
lawrence
having
no
independent
access
to
the
atlantic
except
during
the
summer
she
had
been
depending
largely
upon
great
britain
for
defence
and
upon
the
united
states
for
trade
she
had
received
warning
that
both
these
supports
were
to
be
weakened
and
that
she
must
rely
more
on
her
own
resources
find
new
channels
of
trade
and
new
means
of
defence
the
country
lay
in
the
midst
of
the
continent
isolated
from
the
west
isolated
in
part
from
the
east
with
a
powerful
and
not
too
friendly
neighbour
to
the
south
upper
and
lower
canada
with
their
racial
differences
as
sharply
defined
as
in
the
days
of
lord
durham
regarded
each
other
with
distrust
one
political
combination
after
another
had
failed
to
obtain
a
working
majority
of
the
legislature
and
domestic
government
was
paralyzed
such
a
combination
of
danger
and
difficulty
within
and
without
might
well
arouse
alarm
rebuke
faction
and
stimulate
patriotism
the
election
of
was
virtually
a
drawn
battle
the
reformers
had
a
large
majority
in
upper
canada
their
opponents
a
like
majority
in
lower
canada
and
thus
not
only
the
two
parties
but
the
two
provinces
were
arrayed
against
each
other
the
reform
government
headed
by
sandfield
macdonald
and
dorion
found
its
position
of
weakness
and
humiliation
intolerable
and
resigned
in
march
the
troubled
called
upon
fergusson
blair
a
colleague
of
sandfield
macdonald
to
form
a
new
administration
he
failed
he
called
upon
cartier
with
a
like
result
he
finally
had
a
little
better
success
with
sir
taché
a
veteran
who
had
been
a
colleague
of
baldwin
of
hincks
and
of
macdonald
taché
virtually
restored
the
government
taking
in
foley
and
mcgee
from
the
other
side
in
less
than
three
months
on
june
this
government
was
defeated
and
on
the
very
day
of
its
defeat
relief
came
letters
written
by
brown
to
his
family
during
the
month
preceding
the
crisis
throw
some
light
on
the
situation
on
may
he
writes
things
here
are
very
unsatisfactory
no
one
sees
his
way
out
of
the
mess
and
there
is
no
way
but
my
way
representation
by
population
there
is
great
talk
of
coalition
and
what
do
you
think
why
that
in
order
to
make
the
coalition
successful
the
imperial
government
are
to
offer
me
the
government
of
one
of
the
british
colonies
i
have
been
gravely
asked
by
several
if
it
is
true
and
whether
i
would
accept
my
reply
was
i
would
rather
be
proprietor
of
the
newspaper
for
a
few
years
than
be
of
canada
much
less
a
trumpery
little
province
but
i
need
hardly
tell
you
the
thing
has
no
foundation
beyond
sounding
what
could
be
done
to
put
me
out
of
the
way
and
let
mischief
go
on
but
we
wo
be
bought
at
any
price
shall
we
on
may
he
writes
that
he
has
brought
on
his
motion
for
constitutional
changes
and
on
may
that
it
has
carried
and
taken
cartier
and
macdonald
by
surprise
much
that
is
directly
practical
may
not
flow
from
the
committee
but
it
is
an
enormous
gain
to
have
the
acknowledgment
on
our
journals
that
a
great
evil
exists
and
that
some
remedy
must
be
found
on
june
brown
as
chairman
of
a
committee
appointed
to
consider
the
difficulties
connected
with
the
government
of
canada
brought
in
a
report
recommending
a
federative
system
applied
either
to
canada
alone
or
to
the
whole
british
north
american
provinces
this
was
the
day
on
which
the
taché
government
was
defeated
on
the
subject
of
the
negotiations
which
followed
between
brown
and
the
government
there
is
a
difference
between
the
account
given
by
sir
john
macdonald
in
the
house
and
accepted
by
all
parties
as
official
and
a
letter
written
by
brown
to
a
member
of
his
family
the
official
account
represents
the
first
movement
as
coming
from
brown
the
letter
says
that
the
suggestion
came
from
the
it
would
seem
likely
that
the
idea
moved
gradually
from
informal
conversations
to
formal
propositions
the
governor
had
proposed
a
coalition
on
the
defeat
of
the
government
and
he
repeated
the
suggestion
on
the
defeat
of
the
government
but
his
official
memorandum
contains
no
reference
to
constitutional
changes
it
would
seem
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
of
coalition
in
the
air
before
brown
made
his
proposals
and
perhaps
some
talk
of
offering
him
an
appointment
that
would
remove
him
from
public
life
but
the
conservative
ministers
were
apparently
thinking
merely
of
a
coalition
that
would
break
the
and
enable
the
ordinary
business
of
the
country
to
proceed
brown
idea
was
to
find
a
permanent
remedy
in
the
form
of
a
change
in
the
constitution
when
he
made
his
proposal
to
with
his
opponents
for
the
purpose
of
settling
the
difficulties
between
upper
and
lower
canada
his
proposal
fell
upon
minds
familiarized
with
the
idea
of
coalition
and
hence
its
ready
acceptance
on
his
part
brown
was
ready
to
abate
certain
party
advantages
in
order
to
bring
about
constitutional
reform
ferrier
in
the
debate
on
confederation
says
that
it
was
he
who
suggested
that
the
proposal
made
by
brown
to
pope
and
morris
should
be
communicated
to
the
government
ferrier
gives
a
lively
account
of
the
current
gossip
as
to
the
meeting
between
brown
and
the
ministers
i
think
i
can
remember
this
being
said
that
when
galt
met
brown
he
received
him
with
that
manly
open
frankness
which
characterizes
him
that
when
cartier
met
brown
he
looked
carefully
to
see
that
his
two
rouge
friends
were
not
behind
him
and
that
when
he
was
satisfied
they
were
not
he
embraced
him
with
open
arms
and
swore
eternal
friendship
and
that
macdonald
at
a
very
quick
glance
saw
there
was
an
opportunity
of
forming
a
great
and
powerful
dependency
of
the
british
empire
we
all
thought
in
fact
that
a
political
millennium
had
arrived
in
a
family
letter
written
at
this
time
brown
said
june
past
one
in
the
morning
we
have
had
great
times
since
i
wrote
you
on
tuesday
we
defeated
the
government
by
a
majority
of
two
they
asked
the
to
dissolve
parliament
and
he
consented
but
before
acting
on
it
at
the
governor
suggestion
they
applied
to
me
to
aid
them
in
reconstructing
the
government
on
the
basis
of
settling
the
constitutional
difficulties
between
upper
and
lower
canada
i
refused
to
accept
office
but
agreed
to
help
them
earnestly
and
sincerely
in
the
matter
they
proposed
negotiations
were
thereupon
commenced
and
are
still
going
on
with
considerable
hope
of
finding
a
satisfactory
solution
to
our
trouble
the
facts
were
announced
in
the
house
by
john
macdonald
amid
tremendous
cheering
from
both
sides
of
the
house
you
never
saw
such
a
scene
but
you
will
have
it
all
in
the
papers
so
i
need
not
repeat
both
sides
are
extremely
urgent
that
i
should
accept
a
place
in
the
government
if
it
were
only
for
a
week
but
i
will
not
do
this
unless
it
is
absolutely
needed
to
the
success
of
the
negotiations
a
more
agreeable
proposal
is
that
i
should
go
to
england
to
arrange
the
new
constitution
with
the
imperial
government
but
as
the
whole
thing
may
fail
we
will
not
count
our
chickens
just
yet
sir
richard
cartwright
then
a
young
member
of
parliament
relates
an
incident
illustrating
the
tension
on
men
minds
at
that
time
he
says
on
that
memorable
afternoon
when
brown
not
without
emotion
made
his
statement
to
a
hushed
and
expectant
house
and
declared
that
he
was
about
to
ally
himself
with
sir
georges
cartier
and
his
friends
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
confederation
i
saw
an
excitable
elderly
little
french
member
rush
across
the
floor
climb
up
on
brown
who
as
you
remember
was
of
a
stature
approaching
the
gigantic
fling
his
arms
about
his
neck
and
hang
several
seconds
there
suspended
to
the
visible
consternation
of
brown
and
to
the
infinite
joy
of
all
beholders
pit
box
and
gallery
included
the
official
account
given
by
macdonald
in
the
house
is
that
immediately
after
the
defeat
of
the
government
on
tuesday
night
the
and
on
the
following
morning
brown
spoke
to
several
supporters
of
the
administration
strongly
urging
that
the
present
crisis
should
be
utilized
in
settling
forever
the
constitutional
difficulties
between
upper
and
lower
canada
and
assuring
them
that
he
was
ready
to
with
the
existing
or
any
other
administration
that
would
deal
with
the
question
promptly
and
firmly
with
a
view
to
its
final
settlement
morris
and
pope
to
whom
the
suggestion
was
made
obtained
leave
to
communicate
it
to
john
macdonald
and
galt
on
june
macdonald
and
galt
called
upon
brown
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
brown
expressed
his
extreme
reluctance
to
entering
the
ministry
declaring
that
the
public
mind
would
be
shocked
by
such
an
arrangement
the
personal
question
being
dropped
for
the
time
brown
asked
what
remedy
was
proposed
macdonald
and
galt
replied
that
their
remedy
was
a
federal
union
of
all
the
british
north
american
provinces
brown
said
that
this
would
not
be
acceptable
to
upper
canada
the
federation
of
all
the
provinces
ought
to
come
and
would
come
in
time
but
it
had
not
yet
been
thoroughly
considered
by
the
people
and
even
were
this
otherwise
there
were
so
many
parties
to
be
consulted
that
its
adoption
was
uncertain
and
remote
he
expressed
his
preference
for
parliamentary
reform
based
on
population
on
further
discussion
it
appeared
that
a
compromise
might
be
found
in
an
alternative
plan
a
federal
union
of
all
the
british
north
american
provinces
or
a
federal
union
of
upper
and
lower
canada
with
provision
for
the
admission
of
the
maritime
provinces
and
the
territory
when
they
desired
there
was
apparently
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
which
alternative
should
be
presented
first
one
memorandum
reduced
to
writing
gave
the
preference
to
the
larger
federation
the
second
and
final
memorandum
contained
this
agreement
the
government
are
prepared
to
pledge
themselves
to
bring
in
a
measure
next
session
for
the
purpose
of
removing
existing
difficulties
by
introducing
the
federal
principle
into
canada
coupled
with
such
provisions
as
will
permit
the
maritime
provinces
and
the
territory
to
be
incorporated
into
the
same
system
of
government
and
the
government
will
by
sending
representatives
to
the
lower
provinces
and
to
england
use
its
best
endeavours
to
secure
the
assent
of
those
interests
which
are
beyond
the
control
of
our
own
legislation
to
such
a
measure
as
may
enable
all
british
north
america
to
be
united
under
a
general
legislature
based
upon
the
federal
principle
it
was
brown
who
insisted
on
this
mode
of
presentation
at
the
convention
of
he
had
expressed
in
the
strongest
language
his
hope
for
the
creation
of
a
great
canadian
nationality
and
he
had
for
years
advocated
the
inclusion
of
the
territories
in
a
greater
canada
but
he
regarded
the
settlement
of
the
difficulties
of
upper
and
lower
canada
as
the
most
pressing
question
of
the
hour
and
he
did
not
desire
that
the
solution
of
this
question
should
be
delayed
or
imperilled
galt
plan
of
federation
comprehensive
and
admirable
as
it
was
had
failed
because
the
assent
of
the
maritime
provinces
could
not
be
secured
and
for
five
years
afterwards
no
progress
had
been
made
it
was
natural
that
brown
should
be
anxiously
desirous
that
the
plan
for
the
reform
of
the
union
of
the
canadas
should
not
fail
whatever
else
might
happen
on
june
brown
called
a
meeting
of
the
members
of
the
opposition
for
upper
canada
it
was
resolved
on
motion
of
hope
mackenzie
that
we
approve
of
the
course
which
has
been
pursued
by
brown
in
the
negotiations
with
the
government
and
that
we
approve
of
the
project
of
a
federal
union
of
the
canadas
with
provision
for
the
inclusion
of
the
maritime
provinces
and
the
territory
as
one
basis
on
which
the
constitutional
difficulties
now
existing
could
be
settled
members
voted
for
this
motion
five
declining
to
vote
a
motion
that
three
members
of
the
opposition
should
enter
the
government
was
not
so
generally
supported
eleven
members
including
alexander
mackenzie
and
oliver
mowat
voting
in
the
negative
the
lower
canadian
reformers
held
aloof
and
in
the
subsequent
debate
in
the
legislature
strongly
opposed
confederation
there
were
many
evidences
of
the
keen
interest
taken
by
the
monk
in
the
negotiations
on
june
he
wrote
to
brown
i
think
the
success
or
failure
of
the
negotiations
which
have
been
going
on
for
some
days
with
a
view
to
the
formation
of
a
strong
government
on
a
broad
basis
depends
very
much
on
your
consenting
to
come
into
the
cabinet
under
these
circumstances
i
must
again
take
the
liberty
of
pressing
upon
you
by
this
note
my
opinion
of
the
grave
responsibility
which
you
will
take
upon
yourself
if
you
refuse
to
do
so
those
who
have
hitherto
opposed
your
views
have
consented
to
join
with
you
in
good
faith
for
the
purpose
of
extricating
the
province
from
what
appears
to
me
a
very
dangerous
position
they
have
frankly
offered
to
take
up
and
endeavour
to
settle
on
principles
satisfactory
to
all
the
great
constitutional
question
which
you
by
your
energy
and
ability
have
made
your
own
the
details
of
that
settlement
must
necessarily
be
the
subject
of
grave
debate
in
the
cabinet
and
i
confess
i
can
not
see
how
you
are
to
take
part
in
that
discussion
or
how
your
opinions
can
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
arrangement
of
the
question
unless
you
occupy
a
place
at
the
council
table
i
hope
i
may
without
impropriety
ask
you
to
take
these
opinions
into
consideration
before
you
arrive
at
a
final
decision
as
to
your
own
course
brown
wrote
home
that
he
in
consenting
to
enter
the
cabinet
was
influenced
by
the
vote
of
the
reform
members
by
private
letters
from
many
quarters
and
still
more
by
the
extreme
urgency
of
the
the
thing
that
finally
determined
me
was
the
fact
ascertained
by
mowat
and
myself
that
unless
we
went
in
the
whole
effort
for
constitutional
changes
would
break
down
and
the
enormous
advantages
gained
by
our
negotiations
probably
be
lost
finally
at
three
i
consented
to
enter
the
cabinet
as
of
the
council
with
other
two
seats
in
the
cabinet
at
my
disposal
one
of
which
mowat
will
take
and
probably
macdougall
the
other
we
consented
with
great
reluctance
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
it
was
such
a
temptation
to
have
possibly
the
power
of
settling
the
sectional
troubles
of
canada
forever
the
announcement
was
made
in
the
house
and
the
excitement
all
over
the
province
is
intense
i
send
you
an
official
copy
of
the
proceedings
during
the
negotiations
from
which
you
will
see
the
whole
story
by
next
mail
i
intend
to
send
you
some
extracts
from
the
newspapers
the
unanimity
of
sentiment
is
without
example
in
this
country
and
were
it
not
that
i
know
at
their
exact
value
the
worth
of
newspaper
laudations
i
might
be
puffed
up
a
little
in
my
own
conceit
after
the
explanations
by
ministers
i
had
to
make
a
speech
but
was
so
excited
and
nervous
at
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
that
i
nearly
broke
down
however
after
a
little
i
got
over
it
and
made
as
mowat
alleges
the
most
telling
speech
i
ever
made
there
was
great
cheering
when
i
sat
down
and
many
members
from
both
sides
crowded
round
me
to
congratulate
me
in
short
the
whole
movement
is
a
grand
success
and
i
really
believe
will
have
an
immense
influence
on
the
future
destinies
of
canada
the
formation
of
the
coalition
cabinet
was
announced
on
june
foley
buchanan
and
simpson
members
of
the
upper
canadian
section
of
the
ministry
retired
and
their
places
were
taken
by
the
hon
george
brown
oliver
mowat
and
william
macdougall
otherwise
the
ministry
remained
unchanged
sir
taché
though
a
conservative
was
acceptable
to
both
parties
and
was
well
fitted
to
head
a
genuine
coalition
but
it
must
have
been
evident
from
the
first
that
the
character
of
a
coalition
would
not
be
long
maintained
the
reform
party
which
had
just
defeated
the
government
in
the
legislature
was
represented
by
only
three
ministers
out
of
twelve
and
this
with
macdonald
skill
in
managing
combinations
of
men
made
it
morally
certain
that
the
ministry
must
eventually
become
conservative
just
as
happened
in
the
case
of
the
coalition
of
brown
had
asked
that
the
reformers
be
represented
by
four
ministers
from
upper
canada
and
two
from
lower
canada
which
would
as
nearly
as
possible
have
corresponded
with
the
strength
of
his
party
in
the
legislature
galt
and
macdonald
represented
that
a
change
in
the
personnel
of
the
lower
canadian
section
of
the
cabinet
would
disturb
the
people
and
shake
their
confidence
the
lower
canadian
liberal
leaders
dorion
and
holton
were
adverse
to
the
coalition
scheme
regarding
it
as
a
mere
device
for
enabling
macdonald
and
his
friends
to
hold
office
mowat
and
brown
were
without
difficulty
but
macdougall
met
with
strong
opposition
in
north
ontario
brown
who
was
working
hard
in
his
interests
found
this
opposition
so
strong
among
conservatives
that
he
telegraphed
to
macdonald
who
sent
a
strong
letter
on
behalf
of
macdougall
brown
said
that
the
opposition
came
chiefly
from
orangemen
the
result
was
that
macdougall
in
spite
of
the
assistance
of
the
two
leaders
was
defeated
by
one
hundred
he
was
subsequently
elected
for
north
lanark
in
other
the
advocates
of
confederation
were
generally
successful
in
the
confederation
debate
brown
said
there
had
been
contests
fourteen
for
the
upper
house
and
eleven
for
the
lower
house
and
that
only
one
or
two
opponents
of
confederation
had
been
elected
there
had
been
for
some
years
an
intermittent
movement
for
the
union
of
the
maritime
provinces
and
in
their
legislatures
had
authorized
the
holding
of
a
convention
at
charlottetown
accordingly
eight
members
of
the
canadian
ministry
visited
charlottetown
where
they
were
cordially
welcomed
they
dwelt
on
the
advantage
of
substituting
the
larger
for
the
smaller
plan
of
union
and
the
result
of
their
representations
was
that
arrangements
were
made
for
the
holding
of
a
general
conference
at
quebec
later
in
the
year
the
canadian
ministers
made
a
tour
through
the
maritime
provinces
speaking
in
public
and
familiarizing
the
people
with
the
plan
at
a
banquet
in
halifax
brown
gave
a
full
exposition
of
the
project
and
its
advantages
in
regard
to
defence
commerce
national
strength
and
dignity
adding
that
it
would
end
the
petty
strifes
of
a
small
community
and
elevate
politics
and
politicians
the
scheme
was
destined
to
undergo
a
more
severe
ordeal
in
the
maritime
provinces
than
these
festive
gatherings
for
the
present
progress
was
rapid
and
the
maritime
tour
was
followed
by
the
conference
at
quebec
which
opened
on
october
footnotes
sir
richard
cartwright
says
also
that
the
credit
of
canada
was
very
low
largely
because
of
the
troubles
of
the
grand
trunk
railway
company
of
of
an
address
delivered
before
the
canadian
club
of
ottawa
january
chapter
xvi
the
quebec
conference
the
conference
was
held
with
closed
doors
so
as
to
encourage
free
discussion
some
fragmentary
notes
have
been
preserved
one
impression
derived
from
this
and
other
records
is
that
the
public
men
of
that
day
had
been
much
impressed
by
the
civil
war
in
the
united
states
by
the
apparent
weakness
of
the
central
authority
there
and
by
the
dangers
of
state
sovereignty
emphasis
was
laid
upon
the
monarchical
element
of
the
proposed
constitution
for
canada
and
upon
the
fact
that
powers
not
expressly
defined
were
to
rest
in
the
general
instead
of
the
local
legislatures
in
fact
chandler
a
representative
of
new
brunswick
complained
that
the
proposed
union
was
legislative
not
federal
and
reduced
the
local
governments
to
the
status
of
municipal
corporations
in
practice
these
residuary
powers
were
not
so
formidable
as
they
appeared
the
defined
powers
of
the
local
legislatures
were
highly
important
and
were
fully
maintained
if
not
enlarged
as
a
result
of
the
resolute
attitude
of
ontario
under
the
mowat
government
but
the
notion
that
canada
must
avoid
the
dangers
of
state
sovereignty
is
continually
cropping
up
in
the
literature
of
confederation
friends
and
opponents
of
the
new
constitution
made
much
of
these
mysterious
residuary
powers
and
the
lower
canadian
liberals
feared
that
they
were
being
drawn
into
a
union
that
would
destroy
the
liberties
and
imperil
the
cherished
institutions
of
the
people
another
point
is
the
extraordinary
amount
of
time
and
labour
given
to
the
constitution
of
the
senate
the
conference
proceedings
wrote
brown
get
along
very
well
considering
we
were
very
near
broken
up
on
the
question
of
the
distribution
of
members
in
the
upper
chamber
of
the
federal
legislature
but
fortunately
we
have
this
morning
got
the
matter
amicably
compromised
after
a
loss
of
three
days
in
discussing
it
during
the
latter
years
of
the
union
the
elective
system
had
prevailed
in
canada
and
mowat
macdougall
and
others
favoured
continuing
this
practice
but
were
overruled
brown
joined
macdonald
in
supporting
the
nominative
system
his
reasons
were
given
in
his
speech
in
the
legislature
in
he
believed
that
two
elective
chambers
were
incompatible
with
the
british
parliamentary
system
the
upper
chamber
if
elected
might
claim
equal
power
with
the
lower
including
power
over
money
bills
it
might
amend
money
bills
might
reject
all
legislation
and
stop
the
machinery
of
government
with
a
conservative
majority
in
one
house
and
a
reform
majority
in
the
other
a
might
occur
to
the
objection
that
the
change
from
the
elective
to
the
nominative
system
involved
a
diminution
of
the
power
of
the
people
brown
answered
that
the
government
of
the
day
would
be
responsible
for
each
appointment
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
responsibility
is
of
little
practical
value
and
that
brown
fully
shared
in
the
delusions
of
his
time
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
senate
would
be
constituted
and
the
part
it
would
play
in
the
government
of
the
country
a
rupture
was
threatened
also
on
the
question
of
finance
a
large
number
of
local
works
which
in
upper
canada
were
paid
for
by
local
municipal
taxation
were
in
the
maritime
provinces
provided
out
of
the
provincial
revenues
the
adjustment
was
a
difficult
matter
and
finally
it
was
found
necessary
for
the
financial
representatives
of
the
different
provinces
to
withdraw
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
a
scheme
on
october
the
conference
was
concluded
and
its
resolutions
substantially
form
the
constitution
of
canada
on
october
brown
wrote
we
got
through
our
work
at
quebec
very
well
the
constitution
is
not
exactly
to
my
mind
in
all
its
details
but
as
a
whole
it
is
wonderful
really
wonderful
when
one
thinks
of
all
the
fighting
we
have
had
for
fifteen
years
and
finds
the
very
men
who
fought
us
every
inch
now
going
far
beyond
what
we
asked
i
am
amazed
and
sometimes
alarmed
lest
it
all
go
to
pieces
yet
we
have
yet
to
pass
the
ordeal
of
public
opinion
in
the
several
provinces
and
sad
indeed
will
it
be
if
the
measure
is
not
adopted
by
acclamation
in
them
all
for
upper
canada
we
may
well
rejoice
on
the
day
it
becomes
law
nearly
all
our
past
difficulties
are
ended
by
it
whatever
new
ones
may
arise
a
journey
made
by
the
delegates
through
canada
after
the
draft
was
completed
enabled
canadians
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
some
men
of
mark
in
the
maritime
provinces
including
tilley
of
new
brunswick
and
tupper
of
nova
scotia
and
it
evoked
in
upper
canada
warm
expressions
of
public
feeling
in
favour
of
the
new
union
it
is
estimated
that
eight
thousand
people
met
the
delegates
at
the
railway
station
in
toronto
at
a
dinner
given
in
the
music
hall
in
that
city
brown
explained
the
new
constitution
fully
he
frankly
confessed
that
he
was
a
convert
to
the
scheme
of
the
intercolonial
railway
for
the
reason
that
it
was
essential
to
the
union
between
canada
and
the
maritime
provinces
the
canal
system
was
to
be
extended
and
as
soon
as
the
finances
would
permit
communication
was
to
be
opened
with
the
territory
this
was
the
first
time
wrote
brown
that
the
confederation
scheme
was
really
laid
open
to
the
public
no
doubt
was
right
in
saying
that
the
were
restive
about
the
scheme
but
the
feeling
in
favour
of
it
is
all
but
unanimous
here
and
i
think
there
is
a
good
chance
of
carrying
it
at
any
rate
come
what
may
i
can
now
get
out
of
the
affair
and
out
of
public
life
with
honour
for
i
have
had
placed
on
record
a
scheme
that
would
bring
to
an
end
all
the
grievances
of
which
upper
canada
has
so
long
complained
the
british
government
gave
its
hearty
blessing
to
the
confederation
and
the
outlook
was
hopeful
in
december
brown
sailed
for
england
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
views
of
the
british
government
he
wrote
from
london
to
macdonald
that
the
scheme
had
given
prodigious
satisfaction
the
ministry
the
conservatives
and
the
manchester
men
are
all
delighted
with
it
and
everything
canadian
has
gone
up
in
public
estimation
immensely
indeed
from
all
classes
of
people
you
hear
nothing
but
high
praise
of
statesmanship
and
loud
anticipations
of
the
great
future
before
us
i
am
much
concerned
to
observe
however
and
i
write
it
to
you
as
a
thing
that
must
seriously
be
considered
by
all
men
taking
a
lead
hereafter
in
canadian
public
matters
that
there
is
a
manifest
desire
in
almost
every
quarter
that
ere
long
the
british
american
colonies
should
shift
for
themselves
and
in
some
quarters
evident
regret
that
we
did
not
declare
at
once
for
independence
i
am
very
sorry
to
observe
this
but
it
arises
i
hope
from
the
fear
of
invasion
of
canada
by
the
united
states
and
will
soon
pass
away
with
the
cause
that
excites
it
chapter
xvii
the
confederation
debate
the
parliament
of
canada
assembled
on
january
to
consider
the
resolutions
of
the
quebec
conference
the
first
presentation
of
the
reasons
for
confederation
was
made
in
the
upper
chamber
by
the
premier
sir
taché
he
described
the
measure
as
essential
to
british
connection
to
the
preservation
of
our
institutions
our
laws
and
even
our
remembrances
of
the
past
if
the
opportunity
were
allowed
to
pass
by
unimproved
canada
would
be
forced
into
the
american
union
by
violence
or
would
be
placed
upon
an
inclined
plane
which
would
carry
it
there
insensibly
canada
during
the
winter
had
no
independent
means
of
access
to
the
sea
but
was
dependent
on
the
favour
of
a
neighbour
which
in
several
ways
had
shown
a
hostile
spirit
the
people
of
the
northern
states
had
an
exaggerated
idea
of
canadian
sympathy
with
the
south
and
the
consequences
of
this
misapprehension
were
first
the
threatened
abolition
of
the
transit
system
second
the
discontinuance
of
reciprocity
third
a
passport
system
which
was
almost
equivalent
to
a
prohibition
of
intercourse
union
with
the
maritime
provinces
would
give
canada
continuous
and
independent
access
to
the
atlantic
and
the
maritime
provinces
would
bring
into
the
common
stock
their
magnificent
harbours
their
coal
mines
their
great
fishing
and
shipping
industries
then
he
recounted
the
difficulties
that
had
occurred
in
the
government
of
canada
ending
in
and
a
condition
bordering
on
civil
strife
he
declared
that
lower
canada
had
resisted
representation
by
population
under
a
legislative
union
but
that
if
a
federal
union
were
obtained
it
would
be
tantamount
to
a
separation
of
the
provinces
and
lower
canada
would
thereby
preserve
its
autonomy
together
with
all
the
institutions
it
held
so
dear
these
were
the
main
arguments
for
confederation
and
in
the
speeches
which
followed
on
that
side
they
were
repeated
enforced
and
illustrated
in
various
ways
in
the
assembly
john
macdonald
as
gave
a
clear
and
concise
description
of
the
new
constitution
he
admitted
that
he
had
preferred
a
legislative
union
but
had
recognized
that
such
a
union
would
not
have
been
accepted
either
by
lower
canada
or
the
maritime
provinces
the
union
between
upper
and
lower
canada
legislative
in
name
had
been
federal
in
fact
there
being
by
tacit
consent
and
practice
a
separate
body
of
legislation
for
each
part
of
the
province
he
described
the
new
scheme
of
government
as
a
happy
combination
of
the
strength
of
a
legislative
union
with
the
freedom
of
a
federal
union
and
with
protection
to
local
interests
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
one
of
the
most
skilful
works
which
human
intelligence
ever
created
one
of
the
most
perfect
organizations
that
ever
governed
a
free
people
experience
had
shown
that
its
main
defect
was
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
this
blemish
was
avoided
in
the
canadian
constitution
by
vesting
all
residuary
powers
in
the
central
government
and
legislature
the
canadian
system
would
also
be
distinguished
from
the
american
by
the
recognition
of
monarchy
and
of
the
principle
of
responsible
government
the
connection
of
canada
with
great
britain
he
regarded
as
tending
towards
a
permanent
alliance
the
colonies
are
now
in
a
transition
state
gradually
a
different
colonial
system
is
being
developed
and
it
will
become
year
by
year
less
a
case
of
dependence
on
our
part
and
of
overruling
protection
on
the
part
of
the
mother
country
and
more
a
case
of
a
hearty
and
cordial
alliance
instead
of
looking
upon
us
as
a
merely
dependent
colony
england
will
have
in
us
a
friendly
nation
a
subordinate
but
still
a
powerful
people
to
stand
by
her
in
north
america
in
peace
or
in
war
brown
spoke
on
the
night
of
february
his
speech
occupying
four
hours
and
a
half
in
delivery
showing
the
marks
of
careful
preparation
he
drew
an
illustration
from
the
mighty
struggle
that
had
rent
the
republic
asunder
and
was
then
within
a
few
weeks
of
its
close
we
are
striving
he
said
to
settle
forever
issues
hardly
less
momentous
than
those
that
have
rent
the
neighbouring
republic
and
are
now
exposing
it
to
all
the
horrors
of
civil
war
have
we
not
then
great
cause
for
thankfulness
that
we
have
found
a
better
way
for
the
solution
of
our
troubles
and
should
not
every
one
of
us
endeavour
to
rise
to
the
magnitude
of
the
occasion
and
earnestly
seek
to
deal
with
this
question
to
the
end
in
the
same
candid
and
conciliatory
spirit
in
which
so
far
it
has
been
discussed
he
warned
the
assembly
that
whatever
else
happened
the
constitution
of
canada
would
not
remain
unchanged
something
must
be
done
we
can
not
stand
still
we
can
not
go
back
to
chronic
sectional
hostility
and
discord
to
a
state
of
perpetual
ministerial
crisis
the
events
of
the
last
eight
months
can
not
be
obliterated
the
solemn
admissions
of
men
of
all
parties
can
never
be
erased
the
claims
of
upper
canada
for
justice
must
be
met
and
met
now
every
one
who
raises
his
voice
in
hostility
to
this
measure
is
bound
to
keep
before
him
when
he
speaks
all
the
perilous
consequences
of
its
rejection
no
man
who
has
a
true
regard
for
the
of
canada
can
give
a
vote
against
this
scheme
unless
he
is
prepared
to
offer
in
amendment
some
better
remedy
for
the
evils
and
injustice
that
have
so
long
threatened
the
peace
of
our
country
in
the
first
place
he
said
confederation
would
provide
a
complete
remedy
for
the
injustice
of
the
system
of
parliamentary
representation
by
giving
upper
canada
in
the
house
of
commons
the
number
of
members
to
which
it
was
entitled
by
population
in
the
senate
the
principle
of
representation
by
population
would
not
be
maintained
an
equal
number
of
senators
being
allotted
to
ontario
to
quebec
and
to
the
group
of
maritime
provinces
without
regard
to
population
secondly
the
plan
would
remedy
the
injustice
of
which
upper
canada
had
complained
in
regard
to
public
expenditures
no
longer
shall
we
have
to
complain
that
one
section
pays
the
cash
while
the
other
spends
it
hereafter
they
who
pay
will
spend
and
they
who
spend
more
than
they
ought
will
bear
the
brunt
if
we
look
back
on
our
doings
of
the
last
fifteen
years
i
think
it
will
be
acknowledged
that
the
greatest
jobs
perpetrated
were
of
a
sectional
character
that
our
fiercest
contests
were
about
local
matters
that
stirred
up
sectional
jealousies
and
indignation
to
their
deepest
depth
confederation
would
end
sectional
discord
between
upper
and
lower
canada
questions
that
used
to
excite
sectional
hostility
and
jealousy
were
now
removed
from
the
common
legislature
to
the
legislatures
of
the
provinces
no
man
need
be
debarred
from
a
public
career
because
his
opinions
popular
in
his
own
province
were
unpopular
in
another
among
the
local
questions
that
had
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
common
legislature
he
mentioned
the
construction
of
local
works
the
endowment
of
ecclesiastical
institutions
the
granting
of
money
for
sectarian
purposes
and
interference
with
school
systems
he
advocated
confederation
because
it
would
convert
a
group
of
inconsiderable
colonies
into
a
powerful
union
of
four
million
people
with
a
revenue
of
thirteen
million
dollars
a
trade
of
one
hundred
and
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
rich
natural
resources
and
important
industries
among
these
he
dwelt
at
length
on
the
shipping
of
the
maritime
provinces
these
were
the
days
of
the
wooden
ship
and
brown
claimed
that
federated
canada
would
be
the
third
maritime
power
in
the
world
confederation
would
give
a
new
impetus
to
immigration
and
settlement
communication
with
the
west
would
be
opened
up
as
soon
as
the
state
of
the
finances
permitted
negotiations
had
been
carried
on
with
the
imperial
government
for
the
addition
of
the
territories
to
canada
and
when
those
fertile
plains
were
opened
for
settlement
there
would
be
an
immense
addition
to
the
products
of
canada
the
establishment
of
free
trade
between
canada
and
the
maritime
provinces
would
be
some
compensation
for
the
loss
of
trade
with
the
united
states
should
the
reciprocity
treaty
be
abrogated
it
would
enable
the
country
to
assume
a
larger
share
of
the
burden
of
defence
the
time
had
come
when
the
people
of
the
united
kingdom
would
insist
on
a
reconsideration
of
the
military
relations
of
canada
to
the
empire
and
that
demand
was
just
union
would
facilitate
common
defence
the
civil
war
in
the
neighbouring
republic
the
possibility
of
war
between
great
britain
and
the
united
states
the
threatened
repeal
of
the
reciprocity
treaty
the
threatened
abolition
of
the
american
bonding
system
for
goods
in
transit
to
and
from
these
provinces
the
unsettled
position
of
the
hudson
bay
company
the
changed
feeling
of
england
as
to
the
relations
of
canada
to
the
parent
state
all
combine
at
this
moment
to
arrest
the
earnest
attention
to
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
unite
us
all
in
one
vigorous
effort
to
meet
the
emergency
like
men
a
strong
speech
against
confederation
was
made
by
dorion
an
old
friend
of
brown
a
staunch
liberal
and
a
representative
he
declared
that
he
had
seen
no
ground
for
changing
his
opinion
on
two
points
the
substitution
of
an
upper
chamber
nominated
by
the
crown
for
an
elective
body
and
the
construction
of
the
intercolonial
railway
which
he
with
other
liberals
had
always
opposed
he
had
always
admitted
that
representation
by
population
was
a
just
principle
and
in
he
had
suggested
in
the
legislature
the
substitution
of
a
federal
for
a
legislative
union
of
the
canadas
or
failing
this
representation
by
population
with
such
checks
and
guarantees
as
would
secure
local
rights
and
interests
and
preserve
to
lower
canada
its
cherished
institutions
when
the
government
was
formed
he
had
proposed
a
federation
of
the
canadas
but
with
the
distinct
understanding
that
he
would
not
attempt
to
carry
such
a
measure
without
the
consent
of
a
majority
of
the
people
of
lower
canada
from
the
document
issued
by
the
lower
canadian
liberals
in
he
quoted
a
passage
in
which
it
was
laid
down
that
the
powers
given
to
the
central
government
should
be
only
those
that
were
essential
and
that
the
local
powers
should
be
as
ample
as
possible
all
that
belongs
to
matters
of
a
purely
local
character
such
as
education
the
administration
of
justice
the
militia
the
laws
relating
to
property
police
ought
to
be
referred
to
the
local
governments
whose
powers
ought
generally
to
extend
to
all
subjects
which
would
not
be
given
to
the
general
government
the
vesting
of
residuary
powers
in
the
provinces
was
an
important
difference
between
this
and
the
scheme
of
confederation
but
the
point
most
dwelt
upon
by
dorion
was
the
inclusion
of
the
maritime
provinces
which
he
strongly
opposed
dorion
denied
that
the
difficulty
about
representation
was
the
source
of
the
movement
for
confederation
he
contended
that
the
agitation
for
representation
by
population
had
died
out
and
that
the
real
authors
of
confederation
were
the
owners
of
the
grand
trunk
railway
company
who
stood
to
gain
by
the
construction
of
the
intercolonial
the
government
were
defeated
because
the
house
condemned
them
for
taking
without
authority
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
out
of
the
public
chest
for
the
grand
trunk
railway
at
a
time
when
there
had
not
been
a
party
vote
on
representation
by
population
for
one
or
two
sessions
he
declared
that
macdonald
had
in
brown
committee
of
voted
against
confederation
and
that
he
and
his
colleagues
adopted
the
scheme
simply
to
enable
them
to
remain
in
office
dorion
also
criticized
adversely
the
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
upper
chamber
from
the
elective
to
the
nominative
system
the
conservative
instincts
of
macdonald
and
cartier
he
said
led
them
to
strengthen
the
power
of
the
crown
at
the
expense
of
the
people
and
this
constitution
was
a
specimen
of
their
handiwork
with
a
appointed
by
the
crown
with
local
governors
also
appointed
by
the
crown
with
legislative
councils
in
the
general
legislature
and
in
all
the
provinces
nominated
by
the
crown
we
shall
have
the
most
illiberal
constitution
ever
heard
of
in
any
government
where
constitutional
government
prevails
he
objected
to
the
power
vested
in
the
to
veto
the
acts
of
local
legislatures
his
expectation
was
that
a
minority
in
the
local
legislature
might
appeal
to
their
party
friends
at
ottawa
to
veto
laws
which
they
disliked
and
that
thus
there
would
be
constant
interference
agitation
and
strife
between
the
central
and
the
local
authorities
he
suspected
that
the
intention
was
ultimately
to
change
the
federal
union
to
a
legislative
union
the
scheme
of
confederation
was
being
carried
without
submission
to
the
people
what
would
prevent
the
change
from
a
federal
to
a
legislative
union
from
being
accomplished
in
a
similar
way
to
this
the
people
of
lower
canada
would
not
submit
a
million
of
inhabitants
may
seem
a
small
affair
to
the
mind
of
a
philosopher
who
sits
down
to
write
out
a
constitution
he
may
think
it
would
be
better
that
there
should
be
but
one
religion
one
language
and
one
system
of
laws
and
he
goes
to
work
to
frame
institutions
that
will
bring
all
to
that
desirable
state
but
i
can
tell
the
honourable
gentleman
that
the
history
of
every
country
goes
to
show
that
not
even
by
the
power
of
the
sword
can
such
changes
be
accomplished
with
some
exaggeration
dorion
struck
at
real
faults
in
the
scheme
of
confederation
the
contention
that
the
plan
ought
to
have
been
submitted
to
the
people
is
difficult
to
meet
except
upon
the
plea
of
necessity
or
the
plea
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
there
was
assuredly
no
warrant
for
depriving
the
people
of
the
power
of
electing
the
second
chamber
and
the
new
method
appointment
by
the
government
of
the
day
has
been
as
unsatisfactory
in
practice
as
it
was
unsound
in
principle
the
federal
veto
on
provincial
laws
has
not
been
used
to
the
extent
that
dorion
feared
but
when
we
consider
how
partisan
considerations
have
governed
appointments
to
the
senate
we
can
scarcely
say
that
there
was
no
ground
for
the
fear
that
the
power
of
disallowance
would
be
similarly
abused
nor
can
we
say
that
dorion
was
needlessly
anxious
about
provincial
rights
when
we
remember
how
persistently
these
have
been
attacked
and
what
strength
skill
and
resolution
have
been
required
to
defend
them
chapter

the
mission
to
england
a
new
turn
was
given
to
the
debate
early
in
march
by
the
defeat
of
the
new
brunswick
government
in
a
general
election
which
meant
a
defeat
for
confederation
and
by
the
arrival
of
news
of
an
important
debate
in
the
house
of
lords
on
the
defences
of
canada
the
situation
suddenly
became
critical
that
part
of
the
confederation
scheme
which
related
to
the
maritime
provinces
was
in
grave
danger
of
failure
at
the
same
time
the
controversy
between
the
imperial
and
colonial
authorities
as
to
the
defence
of
canada
had
come
to
a
head
the
two
subjects
were
intimately
connected
the
british
government
had
been
led
to
believe
that
if
confederation
were
accomplished
the
defensive
power
of
canada
would
be
much
increased
and
the
new
union
would
be
ready
to
assume
larger
obligations
from
this
time
the
tone
of
the
debate
is
entirely
changed
it
ceases
to
be
a
philosophic
deliberation
of
the
merits
of
the
new
scheme
a
note
of
urgency
and
anxiety
is
found
in
the
ministerial
speeches
the
previous
question
is
moved
and
the
proceedings
hurried
to
a
close
amid
angry
protests
from
the
opposition
brown
wrote
on
march
we
are
going
to
have
a
great
scene
in
the
house
the
government
of
new
brunswick
appealed
to
the
people
on
confederation
by
a
general
election
and
have
got
beaten
this
puts
a
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
our
scheme
and
we
mean
to
act
promptly
and
decidedly
upon
it
at
three
we
are
to
announce
the
necessity
of
carrying
the
resolutions
at
once
sending
home
a
deputation
to
england
and
proroguing
parliament
without
any
unnecessary
delay
say
in
a
week
the
announcement
was
made
to
the
house
by
macdonald
who
laid
much
stress
on
the
disappointment
that
would
be
occasioned
in
england
by
the
abandonment
of
a
scheme
by
which
canadian
colonies
should
cease
to
be
a
source
of
embarrassment
and
become
a
source
of
strength
the
question
of
confederation
was
intimately
connected
with
the
question
of
defence
and
that
was
a
question
of
the
most
imminent
necessity
the
provincial
government
had
been
in
continued
correspondence
with
the
home
government
as
to
defence
against
every
hostile
pressure
from
whatever
source
it
may
come
a
lively
debate
ensued
john
sandfield
macdonald
said
that
the
defeat
of
the
new
brunswick
government
meant
the
defeat
of
the
larger
scheme
of
confederation
unless
it
was
intended
that
the
people
should
be
bribed
into
acquiescence
or
bullied
into
submission
the
hon
tilley
and
his
followers
are
routed
horse
and
foot
by
the
honest
people
of
the
province
scouted
by
those
whose
interests
he
had
betrayed
and
whose
behests
he
had
neglected
and
i
think
his
fate
ought
to
be
a
warning
to
those
who
adopted
this
scheme
without
authority
and
who
ask
the
house
to
ratify
it
without
seeking
to
obtain
the
sanction
of
the
people
later
on
he
charged
the
ministers
with
the
intention
of
manufacturing
an
entirely
new
bill
obtaining
the
sanction
of
the
british
government
and
forcing
it
on
the
canadian
people
as
was
done
in
this
charge
was
hotly
resented
by
brown
and
it
drew
from
john
macdonald
a
more
explicit
statement
of
the
intentions
of
the
government
they
would
if
the
legislature
adopted
the
confederation
resolutions
proceed
to
england
inform
the
imperial
government
of
what
had
passed
in
canada
and
new
brunswick
and
take
counsel
with
that
government
as
to
the
affairs
of
canada
especially
in
regard
to
defence
and
the
reciprocity
treaty
the
legislature
would
then
be
called
together
again
forthwith
the
report
of
the
conferences
in
england
submitted
and
the
business
relating
to
confederation
completed
on
the
following
day
macdonald
made
another
announcement
referring
to
a
debate
in
the
house
of
lords
on
february
which
he
regarded
as
of
the
utmost
importance
a
report
made
by
a
colonel
jervois
on
the
defences
of
canada
had
been
published
and
the
publication
exposing
the
extreme
weakness
of
canada
was
regarded
as
an
official
indiscretion
it
asserted
that
under
the
arrangements
then
existing
british
and
canadian
forces
together
could
not
defend
the
colony
lord
lyveden
brought
the
question
up
in
the
house
of
lords
and
dwelt
upon
the
gravity
of
the
situation
created
by
the
defencelessness
of
canada
and
by
the
hostility
of
the
united
states
he
held
that
great
britain
must
do
one
of
two
things
withdraw
her
troops
and
abandon
the
country
altogether
or
defend
it
with
the
full
power
of
the
empire
it
was
folly
to
send
troops
out
in
driblets
and
spend
money
in
the
same
way
the
earl
de
grey
and
ripon
replying
for
the
government
said
that
jervois
report
contained
nothing
that
was
not
previously
known
about
the
weakness
of
canada
he
explained
the
proposed
arrangement
by
which
the
imperial
government
was
to
fortify
quebec
at
a
cost
of
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
canada
would
undertake
the
defence
of
montreal
and
the
west
commenting
on
a
report
of
this
discussion
macdonald
said
there
had
been
negotiations
between
the
two
governments
and
that
he
hoped
these
would
result
in
full
provision
for
the
defence
of
canada
both
east
and
west
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
canada
should
be
represented
in
england
at
this
juncture
in
order
to
expedite
the
debate
by
shutting
out
amendments
he
moved
the
previous
question
macdonald
motion
provoked
charges
of
burking
free
discussion
and
of
obstruction
want
of
patriotism
and
inclinations
towards
annexation
the
debate
lost
its
academic
calm
and
became
acrimonious
holton
motion
for
an
adjournment
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
further
information
as
to
the
scheme
was
ruled
out
of
order
the
same
fate
befell
dorion
motion
for
an
adjournment
of
the
debate
and
an
appeal
to
the
people
on
the
ground
that
it
involved
fundamental
changes
in
the
political
institutions
and
political
relations
of
the
province
changes
not
contemplated
at
the
last
general
election
on
march
the
main
motion
adopting
the
resolutions
of
the
quebec
conference
was
carried
by
to
on
the
following
day
an
amendment
similar
to
dorion
for
an
appeal
to
the
people
was
moved
by
the
hon
john
hillyard
cameron
of
peel
seconded
by
matthew
crooks
cameron
of
north
ontario
undoubtedly
the
argument
for
submission
to
the
people
was
strong
and
was
hardly
met
by
vigorous
speech
in
reply
but
the
overwhelming
opinion
of
the
house
was
against
delay
and
on
march
the
discussion
came
to
an
end
the
prospects
for
the
inclusion
of
the
maritime
provinces
were
now
poor
newfoundland
and
prince
edward
island
withdrew
a
strong
feeling
against
confederation
was
arising
in
nova
scotia
and
it
was
proposed
there
to
return
to
the
original
idea
of
a
separate
maritime
union
it
was
decided
to
ask
the
aid
of
the
british
government
in
overcoming
the
hesitation
of
the
maritime
provinces
the
british
authorities
were
pressing
canada
to
assume
increased
obligations
as
to
defence
defence
depended
on
confederation
and
england
by
exercising
some
friendly
pressure
on
new
brunswick
might
promote
both
objects
the
committee
appointed
to
confer
with
the
british
government
was
composed
of
macdonald
brown
cartier
and
galt
they
met
in
england
a
committee
of
the
imperial
cabinet
gladstone
cardwell
the
duke
of
somerset
and
earl
de
grey
and
ripon
an
agreement
was
arrived
at
as
to
defence
canada
would
undertake
works
of
defence
at
and
west
of
montreal
and
maintain
a
certain
militia
force
great
britain
would
complete
fortifications
at
quebec
provide
the
whole
armament
and
guarantee
a
loan
for
the
sum
necessary
to
construct
the
works
undertaken
by
canada
and
in
case
of
war
would
defend
every
portion
of
canada
with
all
the
resources
of
the
empire
an
agreement
was
made
as
to
the
acquisition
of
the
hudson
bay
territory
by
canada
and
as
to
the
influence
to
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
maritime
provinces
the
idea
of
coercing
the
maritime
provinces
into
the
measure
was
never
for
a
moment
entertained
the
end
sought
was
to
impress
upon
them
the
grave
responsibility
of
thwarting
a
measure
so
pregnant
with
future
prosperity
to
british
america
in
spite
of
the
mild
language
used
in
regard
to
new
brunswick
the
fact
that
its
consent
was
a
vital
part
of
the
whole
scheme
must
have
been
an
incentive
to
heroic
measures
and
these
were
taken
one
of
the
causes
of
the
defeat
of
the
confederation
government
of
new
brunswick
had
been
the
active
hostility
of
the
arthur
hamilton
gordon
son
of
the
earl
of
aberdeen
he
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
change
and
is
believed
to
have
gone
to
the
limit
of
his
authority
in
aiding
and
encouraging
its
opponents
in
the
election
of
soon
afterwards
he
visited
england
and
it
is
believed
that
he
was
sent
for
by
the
home
authorities
and
was
taken
to
task
for
his
conduct
and
instructed
to
assist
in
carrying
out
confederation
a
despatch
from
cardwell
secretary
of
state
for
the
colonies
to
governor
gordon
expressed
the
strong
and
deliberate
opinion
of
her
majesty
government
in
favour
of
a
union
of
all
the
north
american
colonies
the
governor
carried
out
his
instructions
with
the
zeal
of
a
convert
showed
the
despatch
to
the
head
of
his
government
set
about
converting
him
also
and
believed
he
had
been
partly
successful
the
substance
of
the
despatch
was
inserted
in
the
speech
from
the
throne
when
the
legislature
met
on
march
the
legislative
council
adopted
an
address
asking
for
imperial
legislation
to
unite
the
british
north
american
colonies
the
governor
without
waiting
for
the
action
of
the
assembly
made
a
reply
to
the
council
expressing
pleasure
at
their
address
and
declaring
that
he
would
transmit
it
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
colonies
thereupon
the
smith
ministry
resigned
contending
that
they
ought
to
have
been
consulted
about
the
reply
that
the
council
not
having
been
elected
by
the
people
had
no
authority
to
ask
the
imperial
parliament
to
pass
a
measure
which
the
people
of
new
brunswick
had
expressly
rejected
at
the
polls
a
protest
in
similar
terms
might
have
been
made
in
the
legislative
assembly
but
the
opportunity
was
not
given
a
government
favourable
to
confederation
was
formed
under
peter
mitchell
with
tilley
as
his
chief
lieutenant
and
the
legislature
was
dissolved
a
threatened
fenian
invasion
helped
to
turn
the
tide
of
public
opinion
and
the
confederate
ministry
was
returned
with
a
large
majority
that
result
however
desirable
did
not
sanctify
the
means
taken
to
bring
about
a
verdict
for
confederation
which
could
hardly
have
been
more
arbitrary

have
been
humiliating
putting
aside
the
question
of
where
the
blame
for
the
feud
lay
it
was
inevitable
that
the
association
should
be
temporary
and
brief
on
august
the
asked
macdonald
to
form
an
administration
macdonald
consented
obtained
the
assent
of
cartier
and
consulted
brown
i
quote
from
an
authorized
memorandum
of
the
conversation
brown
replied
that
he
was
quite
prepared
to
enter
into
arrangements
for
the
continuance
of
the
government
in
the
same
position
as
it
occupied
previous
to
the
death
of
sir
etienne
taché
but
that
the
proposal
now
made
involved
a
grave
departure
from
that
position
the
government
heretofore
had
been
a
coalition
of
three
political
parties
each
represented
by
an
active
party
leader
but
all
acting
under
one
chief
who
had
ceased
to
be
actuated
by
strong
party
feelings
or
personal
ambitions
and
who
was
well
fitted
to
give
confidence
to
all
the
three
sections
of
the
coalition
that
the
conditions
which
united
them
would
be
carried
out
in
good
faith
to
the
very
letter
macdonald
cartier
and
himself
brown
were
on
the
contrary
regarded
as
party
leaders
with
party
feelings
and
aspirations
and
to
place
any
one
of
them
in
an
attitude
of
superiority
to
the
others
with
the
vast
advantage
of
the
premiership
would
in
the
public
mind
lessen
the
security
of
good
faith
and
seriously
endanger
the
existence
of
the
coalition
it
would
be
an
entire
change
of
the
situation
whichever
of
the
three
was
so
preferred
the
act
would
amount
to
an
abandonment
of
the
coalition
basis
and
a
reconstruction
of
the
government
on
party
lines
under
a
party
leader
when
the
coalition
was
formed
the
liberals
were
in
a
majority
in
the
legislature
for
reasons
of
state
they
had
relinquished
their
party
advantage
and
a
government
was
formed
in
which
the
conservatives
had
nine
members
and
the
liberals
three
in
what
light
would
the
liberal
party
regard
this
new
proposition
brown
suggested
that
an
invitation
be
extended
to
some
gentleman
of
good
position
in
the
legislative
council
under
whom
all
parties
could
act
with
confidence
as
successor
to
colonel
taché
so
far
as
to
the
party
speaking
however
for
himself
alone
brown
said
he
occupied
the
same
position
as
in
he
stood
prepared
to
give
outside
the
ministry
a
frank
and
earnest
support
to
any
ministry
that
might
be
formed
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
confederation
macdonald
replied
that
he
had
no
personal
feeling
as
to
the
premiership
and
would
readily
stand
aside
and
he
suggested
the
name
of
cartier
as
leader
of
the
brown
said
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
consult
with
his
political
friends
sir
narcisse
belleau
a
member
of
the
executive
council
was
then
proposed
by
macdonald
and
accepted
by
brown
on
condition
that
the
policy
of
confederation
should
be
stated
in
precise
terms
sir
narcisse
belleau
became
nominal
prime
minister
of
canada
and
the
difficulty
was
tided
over
for
a
few
months
the
arrangement
however
was
a
mere
makeshift
the
objections
set
forth
by
brown
to
macdonald
assuming
the
title
of
leader
applied
with
equal
force
to
his
assuming
the
leadership
in
fact
as
he
necessarily
did
under
sir
narcisse
belleau
the
discussion
over
this
point
though
couched
in
language
of
diplomatic
courtesy
must
have
irritated
both
parties
and
their
relations
grew
steadily
worse
the
immediate
and
assigned
cause
of
the
rupture
was
a
disagreement
in
regard
to
negotiations
for
the
renewal
of
the
reciprocity
treaty
it
is
admitted
that
it
was
only
in
part
the
real
cause
and
would
not
have
severed
the
relations
between
men
who
were
personally
and
politically
in
sympathy
brown
had
taken
a
deep
interest
in
the
subject
of
reciprocity
in
he
was
in
communication
with
john
sandfield
macdonald
then
premier
of
canada
and
luther
holton
minister
of
finance
he
dwelt
on
the
importance
of
opening
communication
with
the
american
government
during
the
administration
of
lincoln
whom
he
regarded
as
favourable
to
the
renewal
of
the
treaty
seward
lincoln
secretary
of
state
suggested
that
canada
should
have
an
agent
at
washington
with
whom
he
and
lord
lyons
the
british
ambassador
could
confer
on
canadian
matters
the
premier
asked
brown
to
go
saying
that
all
his
colleagues
were
agreed
upon
his
eminent
fitness
for
the
mission
brown
declined
the
mission
contending
that
holton
besides
being
fully
qualified
was
by
virtue
of
his
official
position
as
minister
of
finance
the
proper
person
to
represent
canada
he
kept
urging
the
importance
of
taking
action
early
before
the
american
movement
against
the
renewal
of
the
treaty
could
gather
headway
but
neither
the
government
nor
its
successor
lived
long
enough
to
take
action
and
the
opportunity
was
lost
the
coalition
government
was
fully
employed
with
other
matters
during
and
it
was
not
until
the
spring
of
that
the
matter
of
reciprocity
was
taken
up
in
the
summer
of
that
year
the
imperial
government
authorized
the
formation
of
a
confederate
council
on
reciprocity
consisting
of
representation
from
canada
and
the
other
north
american
colonies
and
presided
over
by
the
brown
and
galt
were
the
representatives
of
canada
on
the
council
brown
was
in
the
maritime
provinces
in
november
on
government
business
on
his
return
to
toronto
he
was
surprised
to
read
in
american
papers
a
statement
that
galt
and
howland
were
negotiating
with
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
at
washington
explanations
were
given
by
galt
at
a
meeting
of
the
cabinet
at
ottawa
on
december
seward
had
told
him
that
the
treaty
could
not
be
renewed
but
that
something
might
be
done
by
reciprocal
legislation
after
some
demur
galt
went
on
to
discuss
the
matter
on
that
basis
he
suggested
the
free
exchange
of
natural
products
and
a
designated
list
of
manufactures
the
customs
duties
on
foreign
goods
were
to
be
assimilated
as
far
as
possible
inland
waters
and
canals
might
be
used
in
common
and
maintained
at
the
joint
expense
of
the
two
countries
galt
followed
up
his
narrative
by
proposing
that
a
minute
of
council
be
adopted
ratifying
what
he
had
done
and
authorizing
him
to
proceed
to
washington
and
continue
the
negotiations
the
discussion
that
followed
lasted
several
days
brown
objected
strongly
to
the
proceeding
he
declared
that
galt
had
flung
at
the
heads
of
the
americans
every
concession
that
we
had
in
our
power
to
make
and
some
that
we
certainly
could
not
make
so
that
our
case
was
foreclosed
before
the
commission
was
opened
he
objected
still
more
strongly
to
the
plan
of
reciprocal
legislation
which
would
keep
the
people
of
canada
dangling
from
year
to
year
on
the
legislation
of
the
american
congress
looking
to
washington
instead
of
to
ottawa
as
the
controller
of
their
commerce
and
prosperity
the
scheme
was
admirably
designed
by
the
americans
to
promote
annexation
before
each
congress
the
united
states
press
would
contain
articles
threatening
ruin
to
canadian
trade
the
maritime
provinces
would
take
offence
at
being
ignored
and
confederation
as
well
as
reciprocity
might
be
lost
his
own
proposal
was
to
treat
galt
proceedings
at
washington
as
unofficial
call
the
confederate
council
and
begin
anew
to
make
a
dead
set
to
have
this
reciprocal
legislation
idea
upset
before
proceeding
with
the
discussion
galt
at
length
suggested
a
compromise
his
proceedings
at
washington
were
to
be
treated
as
unofficial
and
no
passed
galt
and
howland
were
to
be
sent
to
washington
to
obtain
a
treaty
if
possible
and
if
not
to
learn
what
terms
could
be
arranged
and
report
to
the
government
brown
regarded
this
motion
as
intended
to
remove
him
from
the
confederate
council
and
substitute
howland
and
said
so
but
he
declared
that
he
would
accept
the
compromise
nevertheless
it
appeared
however
that
there
had
been
a
misunderstanding
as
to
the
recording
of
a
minute
of
the
proceedings
the
first
minute
was
withdrawn
but
as
brown
considered
that
the
second
minute
still
sanctioned
the
idea
of
reciprocal
legislation
he
refused
to
sign
it
and
decided
to
place
his
resignation
in
the
hands
of
the
premier
and
to
wait
upon
the
after
hearing
the
explanation
his
excellency
said
then
brown
i
am
called
upon
to
decide
between
your
policy
and
that
of
the
other
members
of
the
government
brown
replied
yes
sir
and
if
i
am
allowed
to
give
advice
in
the
matter
i
should
say
that
the
government
ought
to
be
sustained
though
the
decision
is
against
myself
i
consider
the
great
question
of
confederation
as
of
far
greater
consequence
to
the
country
than
reciprocity
negotiations
my
resignation
may
aid
in
preventing
their
policy
on
the
reciprocity
question
from
being
carried
out
or
at
least
call
forth
a
full
expression
of
opinion
on
the
subject
and
the
government
should
be
sustained
if
wrong
in
this
for
the
sake
of
confederation
the
debate
in
council
had
occupied
several
days
and
had
evidently
aroused
strong
feelings
undoubtedly
brown
decision
was
affected
by
the
affront
that
he
considered
had
been
put
upon
him
by
virtually
removing
him
from
the
confederate
council
and
sending
howland
instead
of
himself
to
washington
as
the
colleague
of
galt
he
disapproved
on
public
grounds
of
the
policy
of
the
government
and
he
resented
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
ignored
throughout
the
transaction
on
the
day
after
the
rupture
cartier
wrote
brown
asking
him
whether
he
could
reconsider
his
resignation
brown
replied
i
have
received
your
kind
note
and
think
it
right
to
state
frankly
at
once
that
the
step
i
have
taken
can
not
be
revoked
the
interests
involved
are
too
great
i
think
a
very
great
blunder
has
been
committed
in
a
matter
involving
the
most
important
interests
of
the
country
and
that
the
you
have
passed
endorses
that
blunder
and
authorizes
persistence
in
it
i
confess
i
was
much
annoyed
at
the
personal
affront
offered
me
but
that
feeling
has
passed
away
in
view
of
the
serious
character
of
the
matter
at
issue
which
casts
all
personal
feeling
aside
if
it
were
necessary
to
seek
for
justification
of
brown
action
in
leaving
the
ministry
at
this
time
it
might
be
found
either
in
his
disagreement
with
the
government
on
the
question
of
policy
or
in
the
treatment
accorded
to
him
by
his
colleagues
sandfield
macdonald
and
his
colleagues
had
on
a
former
occasion
recognized
brown
eminent
fitness
to
represent
canada
in
the
negotiations
at
washington
not
only
because
of
his
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
subject
but
because
of
his
steadily
maintained
attitude
of
friendship
for
the
north
he
was
a
member
of
the
confederate
council
on
reciprocity
his
position
in
the
ministry
was
not
that
of
a
subordinate
but
of
the
representative
of
a
powerful
party
in
resenting
the
manner
in
which
his
position
was
ignored
he
does
not
seem
to
have
exceeded
the
bounds
of
proper
however
this
controversy
assumes
less
importance
if
it
is
recognized
that
the
rupture
was
inevitable
the
precise
time
or
occasion
is
of
less
importance
than
the
force
which
was
always
and
under
all
circumstances
operating
to
draw
brown
away
from
an
association
injurious
to
himself
and
to
liberalism
in
its
broad
sense
as
well
as
in
its
party
sense
and
to
his
influence
as
a
public
man
this
had
better
be
considered
in
another
place
chapter
xx
confederation
and
the
parties
we
are
to
consider
now
the
question
of
the
connection
of
brown
with
the
coalition
of
ought
he
to
have
entered
the
coalition
government
having
entered
it
was
he
justified
in
leaving
it
in
holton
and
dorion
told
him
that
by
his
action
in
he
had
sacrificed
his
own
party
interests
to
those
of
john
macdonald
that
macdonald
was
in
serious
political
difficulty
and
had
been
defeated
in
the
legislature
that
he
seized
upon
brown
suggestion
merely
as
a
means
of
keeping
himself
in
office
that
for
the
sake
of
office
he
accepted
the
idea
of
confederation
after
having
voted
against
it
in
brown
committee
a
most
wise
and
faithful
friend
alexander
mackenzie
thought
that
reformers
should
accept
no
representation
in
the
cabinet
but
that
they
should
give
confederation
an
outside
support
that
macdonald
and
his
party
were
immensely
benefitted
by
brown
action
there
can
be
no
doubt
for
several
years
they
had
either
been
in
opposition
or
in
office
under
a
most
precarious
tenure
depending
entirely
upon
a
majority
from
lower
canada
by
brown
action
they
were
suddenly
invested
with
an
overwhelming
majority
and
they
had
an
interrupted
lease
of
power
for
the
nine
years
between
the
coalition
and
the
pacific
scandal
admitting
that
the
interest
of
the
country
warranted
this
sacrifice
of
the
interests
of
the
liberal
party
we
have
still
to
consider
whether
it
was
wise
for
brown
to
enter
the
ministry
and
especially
to
enter
it
on
the
conditions
that
existed
the
lower
canadian
liberals
were
not
represented
partly
because
dorion
and
holton
held
back
and
partly
because
of
the
prejudice
of
taché
and
cartier
against
the
rouges
and
this
exclusion
was
a
serious
defect
in
a
ministry
supposed
to
be
formed
on
a
broad
and
patriotic
basis
the
result
was
that
while
the
liberals
were
in
a
majority
in
the
legislature
they
had
only
three
representatives
in
a
ministry
of
twelve
such
a
government
with
its
dominant
conservative
section
led
by
a
master
in
the
handling
of
political
combinations
was
bound
to
lose
its
character
of
a
coalition
and
become
conservative
out
and
out
a
broader
question
is
involved
than
that
of
the
mere
party
advantage
obtained
by
macdonald
and
his
party
in
the
retention
of
power
and
patronage
there
was
grave
danger
to
the
essential
principles
of
liberalism
of
which
brown
was
the
appointed
guardian
holton
put
this
in
a
remarkable
way
during
the
debate
on
confederation
it
was
at
the
time
when
macdonald
had
moved
the
previous
question
when
the
coalition
government
was
hurrying
the
debate
to
a
conclusion
in
the
face
of
indignant
protests
and
demands
that
the
scheme
should
be
submitted
to
the
people
holton
told
brown
that
he
had
destroyed
the
liberal
party
henceforth
its
members
would
be
known
as
those
who
once
ranged
themselves
together
in
upper
and
lower
canada
under
the
liberal
banner
then
followed
this
remarkable
appeal
to
his
old
friend
most
of
us
remember
those
of
us
who
have
been
for
a
few
years
in
public
life
in
this
country
must
remember
a
very
striking
speech
delivered
by
the
honourable
member
for
south
oxford
in
toronto
in
the
session
of
or
in
which
he
described
the
path
of
the
macdonald
as
studded
all
along
by
the
gravestones
of
his
slaughtered
colleagues
well
there
are
not
wanting
those
who
think
they
can
descry
in
the
not
very
remote
distance
a
yawning
grave
waiting
for
the
noblest
victim
of
them
all
and
i
very
much
fear
that
unless
the
honourable
gentleman
has
the
courage
to
assert
his
own
original
strength
and
he
has
great
strength
and
to
discard
the
blandishments
and
the
sweets
of
office
and
to
plant
himself
where
he
stood
formerly
in
the
affections
and
confidence
of
the
people
of
this
country
as
the
foremost
defender
of
the
rights
of
the
people
as
the
foremost
champion
of
the
privileges
of
a
free
parliament
unless
he
hastens
to
do
that
i
very
much
fear
that
he
too
may
fall
a
victim
the
noblest
victim
of
them
all
to
the
arts
if
not
the
arms
of
the
fell
destroyer
there
was
a
little
humorous
exaggeration
in
the
personal
references
to
macdonald
for
holton
and
he
were
on
friendly
terms
but
there
was
also
matter
for
serious
thought
in
his
words
though
macdonald
had
outgrown
the
fossil
toryism
that
opposed
responsible
government
he
was
essentially
conservative
and
there
was
something
not
democratic
in
his
habit
of
dealing
with
individuals
rather
than
with
people
in
the
mass
and
of
accomplishing
his
ends
by
private
letters
and
interviews
and
by
other
forms
of
personal
influence
rather
than
by
the
public
advocacy
of
causes
association
with
him
was
injurious
to
men
of
essentially
liberal
and
democratic
tendencies
and
subordination
was
fatal
if
not
to
their
usefulness
at
least
to
their
liberal
ideals
macdougall
and
howland
remained
in
the
ministry
until
confederation
was
achieved
and
found
reasons
for
remaining
there
afterwards
at
the
reform
convention
of
when
the
relation
of
the
liberal
party
to
the
coalition
was
considered
they
defended
their
position
with
skill
and
force
but
the
association
of
one
with
macdonald
was
very
brief
and
of
the
other
very
unhappy
howland
was
not
a
very
keen
politician
and
a
year
after
confederation
was
accomplished
he
accepted
the
position
of
of
ontario
macdougall
had
an
unsatisfactory
career
as
a
minister
with
an
unhappy
termination
he
was
clearly
out
of
his
element
tilley
was
described
as
a
liberal
but
there
was
nothing
to
distinguish
him
from
his
conservative
colleagues
in
his
methods
or
his
utterances
and
he
became
the
champion
of
the
essentially
conservative
policy
of
protection
but
the
most
notable
example
of
the
truth
of
holton
words
and
the
soundness
of
his
advice
was
joseph
howe
howe
was
in
nova
scotia
the
foremost
defender
of
the
rights
of
people
the
foremost
champion
of
the
privileges
of
free
parliaments
he
had
opposed
the
inclusion
of
nova
scotia
on
the
solid
ground
that
it
was
accomplished
by
arbitrary
means
at
length
he
bowed
to
the
inevitable
in
ceasing
to
encourage
a
useless
and
dangerous
agitation
he
stood
on
patriotic
ground
but
in
an
evil
hour
he
was
persuaded
to
seal
his
submission
by
joining
the
macdonald
government
and
thenceforth
his
influence
was
at
an
end
his
biographer
says
that
howe
four
years
in
sir
john
macdonald
cabinet
are
the
least
glorious
of
his
whole
career
howe
had
been
accustomed
all
his
life
to
lead
and
control
events
he
found
himself
a
member
of
a
government
of
which
sir
john
macdonald
was
the
supreme
head
and
of
a
cast
of
mind
totally
different
from
his
own
sir
john
macdonald
was
a
shrewd
political
manager
an
opportunist
whose
unfailing
judgment
led
him
unerringly
to
pursue
the
course
most
likely
to
succeed
each
hour
each
day
each
year
howe
had
the
genius
of
a
bold
reformer
a
courageous
and
creative
type
of
mind
who
thought
in
continents
dreamed
dreams
and
conceived
great
ideas
sir
john
macdonald
busied
himself
with
what
concerned
the
immediate
interests
of
the
hour
in
which
he
was
then
living
and
yet
sir
john
macdonald
was
a
leader
who
permitted
no
insubordination
sir
georges
cartier
a
man
not
to
be
named
in
the
same
breath
with
howe
as
a
statesman
was
nevertheless
a
thousand
times
of
more
moment
and
concern
with
his
band
of
bleu
followers
in
the
house
of
commons
than
a
dozen
howes
and
the
consequence
is
that
we
find
for
four
years
the
great
old
man
playing
second
fiddle
to
his
inferiors
and
cutting
a
far
from
heroic
figure
in
the
arena
what
holton
said
by
way
of
warning
to
brown
was
realized
in
the
case
of
howe
he
was
the
noblest
victim
of
them
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
liberalism
and
of
his
influence
as
a
public
man
brown
did
not
leave
the
ministry
a
moment
too
soon
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
in
favour
of
mackenzie
view
that
he
ought
to
have
refused
to
enter
the
coalition
at
all
and
confined
himself
to
giving
his
general
support
to
confederation
by
this
means
he
would
not
have
been
responsible
for
the
methods
by
which
the
new
constitution
was
brought
into
effect
methods
that
were
in
many
respects
repugnant
to
those
essential
principles
of
liberalism
of
which
brown
had
been
one
of
the
foremost
champions
at
almost
every
stage
in
the
proceedings
there
was
a
violation
of
those
rights
of
which
had
been
so
hardly
won
by
canada
nova
scotia
and
new
brunswick
the
quebec
conference
was
a
meeting
of
persons
who
had
been
chosen
to
administer
the
affairs
of
the
various
british
provinces
under
their
established
constitutions
not
to
make
a
new
constitution
its
deliberations
were
secret
it
proceeded
without
a
mandate
from
the
people
to
create
a
new
governing
body
whose
powers
were
obtained
at
the
expense
of
those
of
the
provinces
with
the
same
lack
of
popular
authority
it
declared
that
the
provinces
should
have
only
those
powers
which
were
expressly
designated
and
that
the
reserve
of
power
should
be
in
the
central
governing
body
had
this
body
been
created
for
the
canadas
alone
this
proceeding
might
have
been
justified
for
they
were
already
joined
in
a
legislative
union
though
by
practice
and
consent
some
features
of
federalism
prevailed
but
nova
scotia
and
new
brunswick
were
separate
communities
and
it
was
for
them
not
for
the
quebec
conference
to
say
what
powers
they
would
grant
and
what
powers
they
would
retain
again
the
people
of
canada
had
declared
that
the
second
chamber
should
be
elected
not
appointed
by
the
crown
the
quebec
conference
without
consulting
the
people
of
canada
reverted
to
the
discarded
system
of
nomination
and
added
the
senate
to
the
vast
body
of
patronage
at
the
disposal
of
the
federal
government
the
constitution
adopted
by
this
body
was
not
except
in
the
case
of
new
brunswick
submitted
to
the
people
and
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
it
was
freely
debated
in
the
parliament
of
canada
for
it
was
declared
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
treaty
and
must
be
accepted
or
rejected
as
a
whole
in
the
midst
of
this
debate
the
people
of
new
brunswick
passed
upon
the
scheme
in
a
general
election
and
condemned
it
in
the
most
decisive
and
explicit
way
the
british
government
was
then
induced
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
province
and
while
it
was
contended
that
this
pressure
was
only
in
the
form
of
friendly
advice
it
was
otherwise
interpreted
by
the
governor
who
strained
his
powers
to
compel
the
ministry
to
act
in
direct
contravention
of
its
mandate
from
the
people
and
when
it
resisted
forced
it
out
of
office
it
is
true
that
in
a
subsequent
election
this
decision
was
reversed
but
that
is
not
a
justification
for
the
means
adopted
to
bring
about
this
result
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
nova
scotia
was
forced
into
the
union
against
the
express
desire
of
a
large
majority
of
its
people
there
are
arguments
by
which
these
proceedings
may
be
defended
but
they
are
not
arguments
that
lie
in
the
mouth
of
a
liberal
and
if
we
say
that
the
confederation
in
spite
of
these
taints
in
its
origin
has
worked
well
and
has
solved
the
difficulties
of
canada
we
use
an
argument
which
might
justify
the
forcible
annexation
of
a
country
by
a
powerful
neighbour
again
there
was
much
force
in
dorion
contention
that
the
new
constitution
was
an
illiberal
constitution
increasing
those
powers
of
the
executive
which
were
already
too
large
to
the
inordinate
strength
of
the
executive
under
the
delusive
name
of
the
crown
may
be
traced
many
of
the
worst
evils
of
canadian
politics
the
abuse
of
the
prerogative
of
dissolution
the
delay
in
holding
the
gerrymandering
of
the
constituencies
by
a
parliament
registering
the
decree
of
a
government
to
these
powers
of
the
government
the
confederation
act
added
that
of
filling
one
branch
of
the
legislature
with
its
own
nominees
by
the
power
of
disallowance
by
the
equivocal
language
used
in
regard
to
education
and
in
regard
to
the
creation
of
new
provinces
pretexts
were
furnished
for
federal
interference
in
local
affairs
but
for
the
resolute
opposition
of
mowat
and
his
colleagues
the
subordination
of
the
provinces
to
the
central
authority
would
have
gone
very
far
towards
realizing
macdonald
ideal
of
a
legislative
union
and
recent
events
have
shown
that
the
danger
of
centralization
is
by
no
means
at
an
end
it
was
a
true
liberal
and
patriotic
impulse
that
induced
brown
to
offer
his
aid
in
breaking
the
of
he
desired
that
upper
canada
should
be
fairly
represented
in
parliament
and
should
have
freedom
to
manage
its
local
affairs
he
desired
that
the
maritime
provinces
and
the
should
in
the
course
of
time
be
brought
in
on
similar
terms
of
freedom
but
by
joining
the
coalition
he
became
a
participant
in
a
different
course
of
procedure
and
if
we
give
him
a
large
perhaps
the
largest
share
of
the
credit
for
the
ultimate
benefits
of
confederation
we
can
not
divest
him
of
responsibility
for
the
methods
by
which
it
was
brought
about
so
long
at
least
as
he
remained
a
member
of
the
government
in
the
year
and
a
half
that
elapsed
between
his
withdrawal
from
the
government
and
the
first
general
election
under
the
new
constitution
he
had
a
somewhat
difficult
part
to
play
he
had
to
aid
in
the
work
of
carrying
confederation
and
at
the
same
time
to
aid
in
the
work
of
the
liberal
party
which
had
been
temporarily
divided
and
weakened
by
the
new
issue
introduced
into
politics
in
the
reform
convention
of
the
attitude
of
the
party
towards
confederation
was
considered
it
was
resolved
that
while
the
new
constitution
contained
obvious
defects
it
was
on
the
whole
based
upon
equitable
principles
and
should
be
accepted
with
the
determination
to
work
it
loyally
and
patiently
and
to
provide
such
amendments
as
experience
from
year
to
year
may
prove
to
be
expedient
it
was
declared
that
coalitions
of
opposing
political
parties
for
ordinary
administrative
purposes
resulted
in
corruption
extravagance
and
the
abandonment
of
principle
that
the
coalition
of
could
be
justified
only
on
the
ground
of
imperious
necessity
as
the
only
available
means
of
obtaining
just
representation
for
upper
canada
and
should
come
to
an
end
when
that
object
was
attained
and
that
the
temporary
alliance
of
the
reform
and
conservative
parties
should
cease
howland
and
macdougall
who
had
decided
to
remain
in
the
ministry
strove
to
maintain
that
it
was
a
true
coalition
and
that
the
old
issues
that
divided
the
parties
were
at
an
end
and
their
bearing
before
a
hostile
audience
was
tactful
and
courageous
but
brown
and
his
friends
carried
all
before
them
brown
argued
strongly
against
the
proposal
to
turn
the
coalition
formed
for
confederation
into
a
coalition
for
ordinary
administrative
purposes
and
in
a
passage
of
unusual
fervour
he
asked
whether
his
reform
friends
were
to
be
subjected
to
the
humiliation
of
following
in
the
train
of
john
macdonald
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
so
chimerical
a
notion
as
a
government
led
by
macdonald
could
have
been
entertained
by
practical
politicians
a
permanent
position
in
a
macdonald
ministry
would
have
been
out
of
the
question
for
brown
not
only
because
of
his
standing
as
a
public
man
but
because
of
his
control
of
the
which
under
such
an
arrangement
would
have
been
reduced
to
the
position
of
an
organ
of
the
conservative
government
there
were
also
all
the
elements
of
a
powerful
liberal
party
which
soon
after
confederation
rallied
its
forces
and
overthrew
sir
john
government
at
ottawa
and
the
coalition
government
he
had
established
at
toronto
giving
macdougall
every
credit
for
good
intentions
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
committed
an
error
in
casting
in
his
political
fortunes
with
sir
john
macdonald
and
that
both
he
and
joseph
howe
would
have
found
more
freedom
more
scope
for
their
energies
and
a
wider
field
of
usefulness
in
fighting
by
the
side
of
mackenzie

canada
and
the
great
west
very
soon
after
his
arrival
in
canada
brown
became
deeply
interested
in
the
territories
he
was
thrown
into
contact
with
men
who
knew
the
value
of
the
country
and
desired
to
see
it
opened
for
settlement
one
of
these
was
robert
baldwin
sullivan
who
during
the
struggle
for
responsible
government
wrote
a
series
of
brilliant
letters
over
the
signature
of
legion
advocating
that
principle
and
who
was
for
a
time
provincial
secretary
in
the
government
in
sullivan
delivered
in
the
mechanics
institute
toronto
an
address
on
the
territories
which
was
published
in
full
in
the
the
oregon
settlement
had
recently
been
made
and
the
great
westward
trek
of
the
americans
was
in
progress
sullivan
uttered
the
warning
that
the
americans
would
occupy
and
become
masters
of
the
british
western
territory
and
outflank
canada
unless
steps
were
taken
to
settle
and
develop
it
by
british
subjects
there
was
at
this
time
much
misconception
of
the
character
of
the
country
and
one
is
surprised
by
the
very
accurate
knowledge
shown
by
sullivan
in
regard
to
the
resources
of
the
country
its
coal
measures
as
well
as
its
wheat
fields
brown
also
obtained
much
information
and
assistance
from
isbester
a
native
of
the
country
who
by
his
energy
ability
and
intelligence
had
raised
himself
from
the
position
of
a
successful
scholar
at
one
of
the
schools
of
the
settlement
to
that
of
a
graduate
of
one
of
the
british
universities
and
to
a
teacher
of
considerable
rank
this
gentleman
had
succeeded
in
inducing
prominent
members
of
the
house
of
commons
to
interest
themselves
in
the
subject
of
appeals
which
through
him
were
constantly
being
made
against
the
injustice
and
persecution
which
the
colonists
of
the
red
river
settlement
were
suffering
brown
said
that
his
attention
was
first
drawn
to
the
subject
by
a
deputation
sent
to
england
by
the
people
of
the
red
river
settlement
to
complain
that
the
country
was
by
the
hudson
bay
company
and
to
pray
that
the
territory
might
be
thrown
open
for
settlement
the
movement
said
brown
was
well
received
by
the
most
prominent
statesmen
of
britain
the
absurdity
of
so
vast
a
country
remaining
in
the
hands
of
a
trading
company
was
readily
admitted
and
i
well
remember
that
gladstone
then
made
an
excellent
speech
in
the
commons
as
he
has
recently
done
admitting
that
the
charter
of
the
company
was
not
valid
and
that
the
matter
should
be
dealt
with
by
legislation
but
the
difficulty
that
constantly
presented
itself
was
what
should
be
done
with
the
territory
were
the
charter
broken
up
what
government
should
replace
that
of
the
company
the
idea
struck
isbester
a
most
able
and
enlightened
member
of
the
red
river
deputation
to
london
that
this
difficulty
would
be
met
at
once
were
canada
to
step
in
and
claim
the
right
to
the
territory
through
a
mutual
friend
i
was
communicated
with
on
the
subject
and
agreed
to
have
the
question
thoroughly
agitated
before
the
expiry
of
the
company
charter
in
i
have
since
given
the
subject
some
study
and
have
on
various
occasions
brought
it
before
the
public
brown
referred
to
the
matter
in
his
maiden
speech
in
parliament
in
and
in
and
again
in
he
gave
notice
of
motion
for
a
committee
of
inquiry
but
was
interrupted
by
other
business
in
the
contained
an
article
so
remarkable
in
its
knowledge
of
the
country
that
it
may
be
reproduced
here
in
part
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
so
little
attention
has
been
paid
in
canada
to
the
immense
tract
of
country
lying
to
the
north
of
our
boundary
line
and
known
as
the
hudson
bay
company
territory
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
injurious
and
demoralizing
sway
of
that
company
over
a
region
of
four
millions
of
square
miles
will
ere
long
be
brought
to
an
end
and
that
the
destinies
of
this
immense
country
will
be
united
with
our
own
it
is
unpardonable
that
civilization
should
be
excluded
from
half
a
continent
on
at
best
but
a
doubtful
right
of
ownership
for
the
benefit
of
two
hundred
and
shareholders
our
present
purpose
is
not
however
with
the
validity
of
the
hudson
bay
company
claim
to
the
country
north
of
the
canadian
line
but
to
call
attention
to
the
value
of
that
region
and
the
vast
commercial
importance
to
the
country
and
especially
to
this
section
which
must
ere
long
attach
to
it
the
too
general
impression
entertained
is
that
the
territory
in
question
is
a
frozen
wilderness
incapable
of
cultivation
and
utterly
unfit
for
colonization
this
impression
was
undoubtedly
set
afloat
and
has
been
maintained
for
its
own
very
evident
purposes
so
long
as
that
opinion
could
be
kept
up
their
charter
was
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
but
light
has
been
breaking
in
on
the
subject
in
spite
of
their
efforts
to
keep
it
out
in
a
recent
work
by
edward
fitzgerald
it
is
stated
that
is
not
a
more
favourable
situation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
for
the
employment
of
agricultural
industry
than
the
locality

asserts
that
there
are
five
hundred
thousand
square
miles
of
soil
a
great
part
of
which
is
favourable
for
settlement
and
agriculture
and
all
so
well
supplied
with
game
as
to
give
great
facility
for

here
is
a

for

the
distance
between
fort
william
and
the
red

settlement
is
about
five
hundred
miles
and
there
is
said
to
be
water
communication
by

all
the
way
but
westward
beyond
the

there
is

to
be
a
magnificent

the

extends
and
is
navigable
for

of
one
thousand
four
hundred
miles
much
has
been
said
of
the
extreme
cold
of
the
country
as
indicated
by
the
thermometer
it
is
well
known
however
that
it
is
not
the
degree
but
the
character
of
the
cold
which
renders
it
obnoxious
to
men
and
the
climate
of
this
country
is
quite
as
agreeable
if
not
more
so
than
the
best
part
of
canada
the
height
of
the
latitude
gives
no
clue
whatever
to
the
degree
of
cold
or
to
the
nature
of
the
climate
let
any
one
look
at
the
map
and
if
he
can
fancy
the
tenth
part
that
is
affirmed
of
the
wide
region
of
country
stretching
westward
to
the
rocky
mountains
he
may
form
some
idea
of
the
profitable
commerce
which
will
soon
pass
through
lake

independent
of
the
hope
that
the
high
road
to
the
pacific
may
yet
take
this
direction
there
is
a
field
for
enterprise
presented
sufficient
to
satiate
the
warmest
imagination
it
was
not
however
until
the
year
that
public
attention
was
aroused
to
the
importance
of
the
subject
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
there
was
a
series
of
letters
in
the
signed
huron
drawing
attention
to
the
importance
of
the
western
country
attacking
the
administration
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
suggesting
that
the
inhabitants
unless
relieved
might
seek
to
place
the
country
under
american
government
in
december
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
toronto
board
of
trade
at
which
addresses
were
delivered
by
alan
mcdonnell
and
captain
kennedy
captain
kennedy
said
that
he
had
lived
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
territory
in
question
had
eight
or
nine
years
before
the
meeting
endeavoured
to
call
attention
to
the
country
through
the
newspapers
and
had
written
a
letter
to
lord
elgin
he
declared
that
the
most
important
work
before
canada
was
the
settlement
of
two
hundred
and
million
acres
of
land
lying
west
of
the
lakes
the
board
of
trade
passed
a
resolution
declaring
that
the
claim
of
the
hudson
bay
company
to
the
exclusive
right
to
trade
in
the
country
was
injurious
to
the
rights
of
the
people
of
the
territory
and
of
british
north
america
the
board
also
petitioned
the
legislature
to
ascertain
the
rights
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
to
protect
the
interests
of
canada
a
few
days
afterwards
the
said
that
the
time
had
come
to
act
and
thenceforward
it
carried
on
a
vigorous
campaign
for
the
opening
up
of
the
territory
to
settlement
and
the
establishment
of
communication
with
canada
during
the
year
brown
addressed
many
meetings
on
the
subject
of
the
working
of
the
union
he
opposed
the
separation
of
the
canadas
proposed
by
some
as
a
measure
of
relief
for
the
grievances
of
upper
canada
this
would
bring
canada
back
to
the
day
of
small
things
he
advocated
expansion
to
the
westward
william
macdougall
then
a
member
of
the
staff
was
also
an
enthusiastic
advocate
of
the
union
of
the
territories
with
canada
in
an
article
reviewing
the
events
of
the
year
the
said
this
year
will
be
remembered
as
that
in
which
the
public
mind
was
first
aroused
to
the
necessity
of
uniting
to
canada
the
great
tract
of
british
american
territory
lying
to
the
then
in
the
occupation
of
a
great
trading
monopoly
the
year
has
only
seen
the
birth
of
this
movement
let
us
hope
that
will
see
it
crowned
with
success
in
january
a
convention
of
reformers
in
toronto
adopted
a
platform
including
free
trade
uniform
legislation
for
both
provinces
representation
by
population
national
and
education
and
the
incorporation
of
the
hudson
bay
territory
it
was
resolved
that
the
country
known
as
the
hudson
bay
territory
ought
no
longer
to
be
cut
off
from
civilization
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
legislature
and
executive
of
canada
to
open
negotiations
with
the
imperial
government
for
the
incorporation
of
the
said
territory
as
canadian
soil
the
proposals
at
this
early
date
provoked
the
merriment
of
some
of
its
contemporaries
the
niagara
january
said
the
toronto
comes
out
with
a
new
and
remarkable
platform
one
of
the
planks
of
which
is
the
annexation
of
the
frozen
regions
of
the
hudson
bay
territory
to
canada
lord
have
mercy
on
us
canada
has
already
a
stiff
reputation
for
cold
in
the
world
but
it
is
unfeeling
in
the
to
want
to
make
it
deserve
the
reproach
the
advised
its
contemporary
not
to
commit
itself
hastily
against
the
annexation
of
the
for
it
will
assuredly
be
one
of
the
strongest
planks
in
our
platform
another
sceptic
was
the
montreal
which
declared
that
the
fertile
spots
in
the
territory
were
small
and
separated
by
immense
distances
and
described
the
red
river
region
as
an
oasis
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
a
vast
treeless
prairie
on
which
scarcely
a
shrub
is
to
be
seen
the
climate
was
unfavourable
to
the
growth
of
grain
the
summer
though
warm
enough
was
too
short
in
duration
so
that
even
the
few
fertile
spots
could
with
difficulty
mature
a
small
potato
or
cabbage
the
subject
seemed
to
be
constantly
in
brown
mind
and
he
referred
to
it
frequently
in
public
addresses
after
the
general
election
of
a
banquet
was
given
at
belleville
to
celebrate
the
return
of
wallbridge
for
hastings
brown
there
referred
to
a
proposal
to
dissolve
the
union
he
was
for
giving
the
union
a
fair
trial
who
can
look
at
the
map
of
this
continent
and
mark
the
vast
portion
of
it
acknowledging
british
sovereignty
without
feeling
that
union
and
not
separation
ought
to
be
the
foremost
principle
with
british
american
statesmen
who
that
examines
the
condition
of
the
several
provinces
which
constitute
british
america
can
fail
to
feel
that
with
the
people
of
canada
must
mainly
rest
the
noble
task
at
no
distant
date
of
consolidating
these
provinces
aye
and
of
redeeming
to
civilization
and
peopling
with
new
life
the
vast
territories
to
our
north
now
so
unworthily
held
by
the
hudson
bay
company
who
can
not
see
that
providence
has
entrusted
to
us
the
building
up
of
a
great
northern
people
fit
to
cope
with
our
neighbours
of
the
united
states
and
to
advance
step
by
step
with
them
in
the
march
of
civilization
sir
it
is
my
fervent
aspiration
and
belief
that
some
here
may
live
to
see
the
day
when
the
british
american
flag
shall
proudly
wave
from
labrador
to
vancouver
island
and
from
our
own
niagara
to
the
shores
of
hudson
bay
look
abroad
over
the
world
and
tell
me
what
country
possesses
the
advantages
if
she
but
uses
them
aright
for
achieving
such
a
future
as
canada
enjoys
a
fertile
soil
a
healthful
climate
a
hardy
and
frugal
people
with
great
mineral
resources
noble
rivers
boundless
forests
we
have
within
our
grasp
all
the
elements
of
prosperity
we
are
free
from
the
thousand
evils
and
abuses
that
afflict
and
retard
the
nations
of
the
old
world
not
even
our
neighbours
of
the
united
states
occupy
an
equal
position
of
advantage
for
we
have
not
the
of
domestic
slavery
to
blight
our
tree
of
liberty
and
greater
than
these
we
are
but
commencing
our
career
as
a
people
our
institutions
have
yet
to
be
established
we
are
free
to
look
abroad
over
the
earth
and
study
the
lessons
of
wisdom
taught
by
the
history
of
older
countries
and
choose
those
systems
and
those
laws
and
customs
that
experience
has
shown
best
for
advancing
the
moral
and
material
interests
of
the
human
family
as
a
member
of
the
coalition
of
brown
had
an
opportunity
to
promote
his
object
of
adding
the
territories
to
canada
there
had
been
some
communication
between
the
british
and
canadian
governments
and
in
november
the
latter
government
said
that
canada
was
anxious
to
secure
the
settlement
of
the
west
and
the
establishment
of
local
governments
as
the
hudson
bay
company
worked
under
an
english
charter
it
was
for
that
government
to
extinguish
its
rights
and
give
canada
a
clear
title
canada
would
then
annex
govern
and
open
up
communication
with
the
territory
when
brown
accompanied
macdonald
cartier
and
galt
to
england
in
this
matter
was
taken
up
and
an
agreement
was
arrived
at
which
was
reported
to
the
canadian
legislature
in
the
second
session
of
the
committee
said
that
calling
to
mind
the
vital
importance
to
canada
of
having
that
great
and
fertile
country
open
to
canadian
enterprise
and
the
tide
of
emigration
into
it
directed
through
canadian
channels
remembering
the
danger
of
large
grants
of
land
passing
into
the
hands
of
mere
money
corporations
and
the
risk
that
the
recent
discoveries
of
gold
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
rocky
mountains
might
throw
into
the
country
large
masses
of
settlers
unaccustomed
to
british
institutions
they
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
the
quickest
solution
of
the
question
would
be
the
best
for
canada
they
therefore
proposed
that
the
whole
territory
east
of
the
rockies
and
north
of
the
american
or
canadian
line
should
be
made
over
to
canada
subject
to
the
rights
of
the
hudson
bay
company
and
that
the
compensation
to
be
made
by
canada
to
the
company
should
be
met
by
a
loan
guaranteed
by
the
british
government
to
this
the
imperial
government
consented
the
subsequent
history
of
the
acquisition
of
the
west
need
not
be
told
here
in
this
case
as
in
others
brown
was
a
pioneer
in
a
work
which
others
finished
but
his
services
were
generously
acknowledged
by
sir
john
macdonald
who
said
in
the
house
of
commons
in
from
the
first
time
that
he
had
entered
parliament
the
people
of
canada
looked
forward
to
a
western
extension
of
territory
and
from
the
time
he
was
first
a
minister
in
the
question
was
brought
up
time
and
again
and
pressed
with
great
ability
and
force
by
the
hon
george
brown
who
was
then
a
prominent
man
in
opposition
to
the
government
footnotes
gunn
and
tuttle
of
toronto
january
chapter
xxii
the
reciprocity
treaty
of
brown
position
in
regard
to
reciprocity
has
already
been
described
he
set
a
high
value
upon
the
american
market
for
canadian
products
and
as
early
as
he
had
urged
the
government
of
that
day
to
prepare
for
the
renewal
of
the
treaty
he
resigned
from
the
coalition
ministry
because
to
use
his
own
words
i
felt
very
strongly
that
though
we
in
canada
derived
great
advantage
from
the
treaty
of
the
american
people
derived
still
greater
advantage
from
it
i
had
no
objection
to
that
and
was
quite
ready
to
renew
the
old
treaty
or
even
to
extend
it
largely
on
fair
terms
of
reciprocity
but
i
was
not
willing
to
ask
for
a
renewal
as
a
favour
to
canada
i
was
not
willing
to
offer
special
inducements
for
renewal
without
fair
concessions
in
return
i
was
not
willing
that
the
canals
and
inland
waters
of
canada
should
be
made
the
joint
property
of
the
united
states
and
canada
and
be
maintained
at
their
joint
expense
i
was
not
willing
that
the
custom
and
excise
duty
of
canada
should
be
assimilated
to
the
prohibitory
rates
of
the
united
states
and
very
especially
was
i
unwilling
that
any
such
arrangement
should
be
entered
into
with
the
united
states
dependent
on
the
frail
tenure
of
reciprocal
legislation
repealable
at
any
moment
at
the
caprice
of
either
party
unless
a
fair
treaty
for
a
definite
term
of
years
could
be
obtained
he
thought
it
better
that
each
country
should
take
its
own
course
and
that
canada
should
seek
new
channels
of
trade
the
negotiations
of
failed
mainly
because
under
the
american
offer
the
most
important
provisions
of
the
expiring
treaty
relating
to
the
free
interchange
of
the
products
of
the
two
countries
were
entirely
set
aside
and
the
duties
proposed
to
be
levied
were
almost
prohibitory
in
their
character
the
offered
by
the
united
states
reads
like
a
diplomatic
joke
rags
grindstones
plaster
and
gypsum
the
real
bar
in
this
and
subsequent
negotiations
was
the
unwillingness
of
the
americans
to
enter
into
any
kind
of
arrangement
for
extended
trade
they
did
not
want
to
break
in
upon
their
system
of
protection
and
they
did
not
set
a
high
value
on
access
to
the
canadian
market
in
most
of
the
negotiations
the
americans
are
found
trying
to
drive
the
best
possible
bargain
in
regard
to
the
canadian
fisheries
and
canals
and
fighting
shy
of
reciprocity
in
trade
they
considered
that
a
free
exchange
of
natural
products
would
be
far
more
beneficial
to
canada
than
to
the
united
states
as
time
went
on
they
began
to
perceive
the
advantages
of
the
canadian
market
for
american
manufactures
but
when
this
was
apparent
canadian
feeling
which
had
hitherto
been
unanimous
for
reciprocity
began
to
show
a
cleavage
which
was
sharply
defined
in
the
discussion
preceding
the
election
of
reciprocity
in
manufactures
was
opposed
because
of
the
competition
to
which
it
would
expose
canadian
industries
and
because
it
was
difficult
to
arrange
it
without
assimilating
the
duties
of
the
two
countries
and
discriminating
against
british
imports
into
canada
in
earlier
years
however
even
the
inclusion
of
manufactures
in
the
treaty
of
reciprocity
was
an
inducement
by
which
the
americans
set
little
store
the
rejected
offer
made
by
canada
in
about
the
exact
terms
of
which
doubt
exists
included
a
list
of
manufactures
in
the
american
government
declined
to
consider
an
offer
to
renew
the
treaty
of
in
return
for
access
to
the
deep
sea
fisheries
of
canada
the
brown
treaty
of
which
contained
a
list
of
manufactures
was
rejected
at
washington
while
in
canada
it
was
criticized
as
striking
a
blow
at
the
infant
manufactures
of
the
country
the
brown
mission
of
was
a
direct
result
of
the
treaty
of
washington
under
that
treaty
there
was
to
be
an
arbitration
to
determine
the
value
of
the
american
use
of
the
canadian
inshore
fisheries
for
twelve
years
in
excess
of
the
value
of
the
concessions
made
by
the
united
states
before
the
fall
of
the
macdonald
government
rothery
registrar
of
the
high
court
of
admiralty
in
england
arrived
in
canada
as
the
agent
of
the
british
government
to
prepare
the
canadian
case
for
arbitration
in
passing
through
toronto
rothery
spoke
to
several
public
men
with
a
view
to
acquiring
information
as
to
the
value
of
the
fisheries
brown
availed
himself
of
that
opportunity
to
suggest
to
him
that
a
treaty
of
reciprocity
in
trade
would
be
a
far
better
compensation
to
canada
than
a
cash
payment
rothery
carried
this
proposal
to
washington
where
it
was
received
with
some
favour
meantime
the
mackenzie
government
had
been
moving
in
the
matter
and
in
february
brown
was
informed
that
there
was
a
movement
at
washington
for
the
renewal
of
the
old
reciprocity
treaty
and
was
asked
to
make
an
unofficial
visit
to
that
city
and
estimate
the
chances
of
success
on
february
he
wrote
we
know
as
yet
of
but
few
men
who
are
bitterly
against
us
i
saw
general
butler
at
his
request
on
the
subject
and
i
understand
he
will
support
us
charles
sumner
is
heart
and
hand
with
us
and
is
most
kind
to
me
personally
on
february
he
expressed
his
belief
that
if
a
bill
for
the
renewal
of
the
reciprocity
treaty
could
be
submitted
to
congress
at
once
it
would
be
carried
a
british
commission
was
issued
on
march
appointing
sir
edward
thornton
british
minister
at
washington
and
brown
as
joint
plenipotentiaries
to
negotiate
a
treaty
of
fisheries
commerce
and
navigation
with
the
government
of
the
united
states
this
mode
of
representation
was
insisted
upon
by
the
mackenzie
government
in
view
of
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
the
negotiations
of
when
sir
john
macdonald
as
one
commissioner
out
of
six
made
a
gallant
but
unsuccessful
fight
for
the
rights
of
canada
brown
was
selected
not
only
because
of
his
knowledge
of
and
interest
in
reciprocity
but
because
of
his
attitude
during
the
war
which
had
made
him
many
warm
friends
among
those
who
opposed
slavery
and
stood
for
the
union
negotiations
were
formally
opened
on
march
the
canadians
proposed
the
renewal
of
the
old
reciprocity
treaty
and
the
abandonment
of
the
fishery
arbitration
the
american
secretary
of
state
mr
fish
suggested
the
enlargement
of
the
canadian
canals
and
the
addition
of
manufactures
to
the
free
list
the
canadian
commissioners
having
agreed
to
consider
these
proposals
a
project
of
a
treaty
was
prepared
to
form
a
basis
of
discussion
it
provided
for
the
renewal
of
the
old
reciprocity
treaty
for
years
with
the
addition
of
certain
manufactures
the
abandonment
of
the
fishery
arbitration
complete
reciprocity
in
coasting
the
enlargement
of
the
welland
and
lawrence
canals
the
opening
of
the
canadian
new
york
and
michigan
canals
to
vessels
of
both
countries
the
free
navigation
of
lake
michigan
the
appointment
of
a
joint
commission
for
improving
waterways
protecting
fisheries
and
erecting
lighthouses
on
the
great
lakes
had
the
treaty
been
ratified
there
would
have
been
reciprocity
in
farm
and
other
natural
products
and
in
a
very
important
list
of
manufactures
including
agricultural
implements
axles

the

of

stereotyping
and

apparatus
in
general
terms
it
was
as
near
to
unrestricted
reciprocity
as
was
possible
without
raising
the
question
of
discriminating
against
the
products
of
great
britain
brown
found
that
american
misapprehensions
as
to
canada
its
revenue
commerce
shipping
railways
and
industries
were
truly
marvellous
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
trade
of
canada
was
of
little
value
to
the
united
states
that
the
reciprocity
treaty
had
enriched
canada
at
their
expense
and
that
the
abolition
of
the
treaty
had
brought
canada
nearly
to
its
wits
end
there
was
some
excuse
for
these
misapprehensions
until
confederation
the
trade
returns
from
the
different
provinces
were
published
separately
if
at
all
no
clear
statement
of
the
combined
traffic
of
the
provinces
with
the
united
states
was
published
until
and
even
canadians
were
ignorant
of
its
extent
american
protectionists
founded
a
balance
of
trade
argument
on
insufficient
data
they
saw
that
old
canada
sold
large
quantities
of
wheat
and
flour
to
the
united
states
but
not
that
the
united
states
sent
larger
quantities
to
the
maritime
provinces
that
nova
scotia
and
cape
breton
sold
coal
to
boston
and
new
york
but
not
that
five
times
as
much
was
sent
from
pennsylvania
to
canada
brown
prepared
a
memorandum
showing
that
the
british
north
american
provinces
from
to
had
bought
one
hundred
and
million
dollars
worth
of
goods
from
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
only
million
dollars
worth
from
the
provinces
that
in
the
thirteen
years
of
the
treaty
the
trade
between
the
two
countries
was
six
hundred
and
thirty
million
dollars
according
to
the
canadian
returns
and
six
hundred
and
seventy
million
dollars
according
to
the
american
returns
and
that
the
balance
of
trade
in
this
period
was
considerably
against
canada
it
was
shown
that
the
repeal
of
the
treaty
did
not
ruin
canadian
commerce
that
the
external
trade
of
canada
which
averaged
one
hundred
and
fifteen
million
dollars
a
year
from
to
rose
to
one
hundred
and
million
dollars
in
the
year
following
the
abrogation
and
to
two
hundred
and
forty
million
dollars
in
in
regard
to
wheat
flour
provisions
and
other
commodities
of
which
both
countries
had
a
surplus
the
effect
of
the
prohibitory
american
duties
had
been
to
send
the
products
of
canada
to
compete
with
those
of
the
united
states
in
neutral
markets
this
memorandum
was
completed
on
april
and
was
immediately
handed
to
mr
fish
it
was
referred
to
the
treasury
department
where
it
was
closely
examined
and
admitted
to
be
correct
from
that
time
there
was
a
marked
improvement
in
american
feeling
brown
also
carried
on
a
vigorous
propaganda
in
the
newspapers
in
new
york
the
of
and
other
journals
declared
in
favour
of
a
new
treaty
and
in
boston
chicago
louis
cincinnati
and
other
large
cities
the
press
was
equally
favourable
a
charge
originated
in
philadelphia
and
was
circulated
in
the
united
states
and
canada
that
this
unanimity
of
the
press
was
obtained
by
the
corrupt
use
of
public
money
brown
in
his
speech
in
the
senate
of
canada
denied
this
said
that
not
a
shilling
had
been
spent
illegitimately
and
that
the
whole
cost
of
the
negotiation
to
the
people
of
canada
would
be
little
more
than
four
thousand
dollars
in
his
correspondence
brown
speaks
of
meeting
senator
conkling
general
garfield
and
carl
schurz
all
of
whom
were
favourable
secretary
fish
is
described
as
courteous
and
painstaking
but
timid
and
lacking
in
grasp
of
the
subject
and
brown
speaks
impatiently
of
the
delays
that
are
throwing
the
consideration
of
the
draft
treaty
over
to
the
end
of
the
session
of
congress
it
did
not
reach
the
senate
until
two
days
before
adjournment
the
president
wrote
brown
on
june
sent
a
message
to
the
senate
with
the
treaty
urging
a
decision
before
the
adjournment
of
congress
i
thought
the
message
very
good
but
it
has
the
defect
of
not
speaking
definitely
of
this
message
as
his
own
and
his
government
and
calling
on
the
senate
to
sustain
him
had
he
done
this
the
treaty
would
have
been
through
now
but
now
with
a
majority
in
its
favour
there
seems
some
considerable
danger
of
its
being
thrown
over
until
december
the
treaty
was
sent
to
the
foreign
relations
committee
of
the
senate
there
were
six
present
three
said
to
be
for
us
one
against
and
two
for
the
measure
personally
but
wanted
to
hear
from
the
country
before
acting
how
it
will
end
no
one
can
tell
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
ended
there
and
then
as
far
as
the
united
states
were
concerned
of
the
objections
urged
against
the
treaty
in
canada
the
most
significant
was
that
directed
against
the
free
list
of
manufactures
this
was
perhaps
the
first
evidence
of
the
wave
of
protectionist
sentiment
that
overwhelmed
the
mackenzie
government
in
his
speech
in
the
senate
in
justifying
the
treaty
brown
said
time
was
in
canada
when
the
imposition
of
duty
on
any
article
was
regarded
as
a
misfortune
and
the
slightest
addition
to
an
existing
duty
was
resented
by
the
people
but
increasing
debt
brought
new
burdens
the
deceptive
cry
of
protection
got
a
footing
in
the
land
and
from
that
the
step
has
been
easy
to
the
bold
demand
now
set
up
by
a
few
favoured
industries
that
all
the
rest
of
the
community
ought
to
be
and
should
rejoice
to
be
taxed
seventeen
and
a
half
per
cent
to
keep
them
in
existence
brown
joined
issue
squarely
with
the
protectionists
i
contend
that
there
is
not
one
article
contained
in
the
schedules
that
ought
not
to
be
wholly
free
of
duty
either
in
canada
or
the
united
states
in
the
interest
of
the
public
i
contend
that
the
finance
minister
of
canada
who
treaty
or
no
treaty
with
the
united
states
was
able
to
announce
the
repeal
of
all
customs
duties
on
the
entire
list
of
articles
in
schedules
a
b
and
c
even
though
the
lost
revenue
was
but
shifted
to
articles
of
luxury
would
carry
with
him
the
hearty
gratitude
of
the
country
nearly
every
article
in
the
whole
list
of
manufactures
is
either
of
daily
consumption
and
necessity
among
all
classes
of
our
population
or
an
implement
of
trade
or
enters
largely
into
the
economical
prosecution
of
the
main
industries
of
the
dominion
the
criticism
of
the
sliding
scale
of
which
so
much
was
heard
at
the
time
was
only
another
phase
of
the
protectionist
objection
the
charge
that
the
treaty
would
discriminate
in
favour
of
american
against
british
imports
was
easily
disposed
of
brown
showed
that
every
article
admitted
free
from
the
united
states
would
be
admitted
free
from
great
britain
but
as
this
meant
british
as
well
as
american
competition
it
made
the
case
worse
from
the
protectionist
point
of
view
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
by
the
united
states
left
a
clear
field
for
the
protectionists
in
canada
four
years
after
brown
speech
defending
the
treaty
he
made
his
last
important
speech
in
the
senate
and
almost
the
last
public
utterance
of
his
life
attacking
tilley
protectionist
budget
and
nailing
his
colours
to
the
mast
chapter
xxiii
canadian
nationalism
it
will
be
remembered
that
after
the
victory
won
by
the
reformers
in
there
was
an
outbreak
of
radical
sentiment
represented
by
the
clear
grits
in
upper
canada
and
by
the
rouges
in
lower
canada
it
may
be
more
than
a
coincidence
that
there
was
a
similar
stirring
of
the
blood
in
ontario
and
in
quebec
after
the
liberal
victory
of
the
founding
of
the
and
of
the
of
the
national
club
and
of
the
canada
first
association
blake
speech
at
aurora
and
goldwin
smith
utterances
combined
to
mark
this
period
as
one
of
extraordinary
intellectual
activity
orthodox
liberalism
was
disquieted
by
these
movements
it
had
won
a
great
and
as
was
then
believed
a
permanent
victory
over
macdonald
and
all
that
he
represented
and
it
had
no
sympathy
with
a
disturbing
force
likely
to
break
up
party
lines
and
to
lead
young
men
into
new
and
unknown
paths
the
platform
of
canada
first
was
not
in
itself
revolutionary
it
embraced
british
connection
closer
trade
relations
with
the
british
west
india
islands
with
a
view
to
ultimate
political
connection
an
income
franchise
the
ballot
with
the
addition
of
compulsory
voting
a
scheme
for
the
representation
of
minorities
encouragement
of
immigration
and
free
homesteads
in
the
public
domain
the
imposition
of
duties
for
revenue
so
adjusted
as
to
afford
every
possible
encouragement
to
native
industry
an
improved
militia
system
under
command
of
trained
dominion
officers
no
property
qualifications
in
members
of
the
house
of
commons
reorganization
of
the
senate
pure
and
economic
administration
of
public
affairs
this
programme
was
severely
criticized
by
the
some
of
the
articles
such
as
purity
and
economy
were
scornfully
treated
as
commonplaces
of
politics
yea
and
who
knoweth
not
such
things
as
these
the
framers
of
the
platform
were
rebuked
for
their
presumption
in
setting
themselves
above
the
old
parties
and
were
advised
to
tarry
in
jericho
until
their
beards
be
grown
but
the
letter
of
the
programme
did
not
evince
the
spirit
of
canada
first
which
was
more
clearly
set
forth
in
the
prospectus
of
the
there
it
was
said
that
the
one
thing
needful
was
the
cultivation
of
a
national
spirit
the
country
required
the
stimulus
of
patriotism
old
prejudices
of
english
scottish
irish
and
german
people
were
crystallized
canadians
must
assert
their
nationality
their
position
as
members
of
a
nation
these
and
other
declarations
were
analyzed
by
the
and
the
heralds
of
the
new
gospel
were
pressed
for
a
plainer
avowal
of
their
intentions
throughout
the
editorial
utterances
of
the
there
was
shown
a
growing
suspicion
that
the
ulterior
aim
of
the
canada
first
movement
was
to
bring
about
the
independence
of
canada
the
quarrel
came
to
a
head
when
goldwin
smith
was
elected
president
of
the
national
club
the
in
its
issue
of
october
brought
its
heaviest
artillery
to
bear
on
the
members
of
the
canada
first
party
it
accused
them
of
lack
of
courage
and
frankness
when
brought
to
book
as
to
their
principles
it
said
they
repudiated
everything
they
repudiated
nativism
they
repudiated
independence
they
abhorred
the
very
idea
of
annexation
the
movement
was
without
meaning
when
judged
by
these
repudiations
but
was
very
significant
and
involved
grave
practical
issues
when
judged
by
the
practices
of
its
members
they
had
talked
loudly
and
foolishly
of
emancipation
from
political
thraldom
as
if
the
present
connection
of
canada
with
great
britain
were
a
yoke
and
a
burden
too
heavy
and
too
galling
to
be
borne
they
had
adopted
the
plank
of
british
connection
by
a
majority
of
only
four
they
had
chosen
as
their
their
prophet
and
their
president
one
whose
chief
claim
to
prominence
lay
in
the
persistency
with
which
he
had
advocated
the
breaking
up
of
the
british
empire
goldwin
smith
had
come
into
a
peaceful
community
to
do
his
best
for
the
furtherance
of
a
cause
which
meant
simply
revolution
the
advocacy
of
independence
said
the
could
not
be
treated
as
an
academic
question
it
touched
every
canadian
in
his
dearest
and
most
important
relations
it
jeopardized
his
material
social
and
religious
interests
canada
was
not
a
mere
dead
limb
of
the
british
tree
ready
to
fall
of
its
own
weight
the
union
was
real
and
the
branch
was
a
living
one
great
britain
it
was
true
would
not
fight
to
hold
canada
against
her
will
but
if
the
great
mass
of
canadians
believed
in
british
connection
those
who
wished
to
break
the
bond
must
be
ready
to
take
their
lives
in
their
hands
the
very
proposal
to
cut
loose
from
britain
would
be
only
the
beginning
of
trouble
in
any
case
what
was
sought
was
revolution
and
those
who
preached
it
ought
to
contemplate
all
the
possibilities
of
such
a
course
they
might
be
the
fathers
and
founders
of
a
new
nationality
but
they
might
also
be
simply
whose
insignificance
and
powerlessness
were
their
sole
protection
who
were
not
important
enough
for
either
a
traitor
trial
or
a
traitor
doom
goldwin
smith
reply
to
this
attack
was
that
he
was
an
advocate
not
of
revolution
but
of
evolution
gradual
emancipation
he
said
means
nothing
more
than
the
gradual
concession
by
the
mother
country
to
the
colonies
of
powers
of
this
process
has
already
been
carried
far
should
it
be
carried
further
and
ultimately
consummated
as
i
frankly
avow
my
belief
it
must
the
mode
of
proceeding
will
be
the
same
that
it
has
always
been
each
step
will
be
an
act
of
parliament
passed
with
the
assent
of
the
crown
as
to
the
filial
tie
between
england
and
canada
i
hope
it
will
endure
forever
goldwin
smith
views
were
held
by
some
other
members
of
the
canada
first
party
another
and
a
larger
section
were
imperialists
who
believed
that
canada
should
assert
herself
by
demanding
a
larger
share
of
within
the
empire
and
by
demanding
the
privileges
and
responsibilities
of
citizens
of
the
empire
the
bond
that
united
the
imperialists
and
the
advocates
of
independence
was
national
spirit
this
was
what
the
failed
to
perceive
or
at
least
to
recognize
fully
its
article
of
october
is
powerful
and
logical
strong
in
sarcasm
and
invective
it
displays
every
purely
intellectual
quality
necessary
for
the
treatment
of
the
subject
but
lacks
the
insight
that
comes
from
imagination
and
sympathy
the
declarations
of
those
whose
motto
was
canada
first
could
fairly
be
criticized
as
vague
but
this
vagueness
was
the
result
not
of
cowardice
or
insincerity
but
of
the
inherent
difficulty
of
putting
the
spirit
of
the
movement
into
words
a
youth
whose
heart
is
stirred
by
all
the
aspirations
of
coming
manhood
yearning
for
the
large
excitement
that
the
coming
years
would
yield
might
have
the
same
hesitation
in
writing
down
his
yearnings
and
aspirations
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
might
be
as
unwisely
snubbed
by
his
elders
the
greatest
intellect
of
the
liberal
party
felt
the
impulse
at
aurora
edward
blake
startled
the
more
cautious
members
of
the
party
by
advocating
the
federation
of
the
empire
the
reorganization
of
the
senate
compulsory
voting
extension
of
the
franchise
and
representation
of
minorities
his
real
theme
was
national
spirit
national
spirit
would
be
lacking
until
we
undertook
national
responsibilities
he
described
the
canadian
people
as
four
millions
of
britons
who
are
not
free
by
the
policy
of
england
in
which
we
had
no
voice
or
control
canada
might
be
plunged
into
the
horrors
of
war
recently
without
our
consent
the
navigation
of
the
lawrence
had
been
ceded
forever
to
the
united
states
we
could
not
complain
of
these
things
unless
we
were
prepared
to
assume
the
full
responsibilities
of
citizenship
within
the
empire
the
young
men
of
canada
heard
these
words
with
a
thrill
of
enthusiasm
but
the
note
was
not
struck
again
the
movement
apparently
ceased
and
politics
apparently
flowed
back
into
their
old
channels
but
while
the
name
the
organization
and
the
organs
of
canada
first
in
the
press
disappeared
the
force
and
spirit
remained
and
exercised
a
powerful
influence
upon
canadian
politics
for
many
years
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
liberal
party
was
injured
by
the
uncompromising
hostility
which
was
shown
to
the
movement
of
young
men
enthusiasts
bold
and
original
thinkers
began
to
look
upon
liberalism
as
a
creed
harsh
dry
tyrannical
unprogressive
and
hostile
to
new
ideas
when
the
independent
lodgment
afforded
by
canada
first
disappeared
many
of
them
drifted
over
to
the
conservative
party
whose
leader
was
shrewd
enough
to
perceive
the
strength
of
the
spirit
of
nationalism
and
to
give
it
what
countenance
he
could
protection
triumphed
at
the
polls
in
not
merely
by
the
use
of
economic
arguments
but
because
it
was
heralded
as
the
national
policy
and
hailed
as
a
declaration
of
the
commercial
independence
of
canada
a
few
years
later
the
legislation
for
the
building
of
the
canadian
pacific
railway
bold
to
the
point
of
rashness
as
it
seemed
and
unwise
and
improvident
in
some
of
its
provisions
was
heartily
approved
by
the
country
because
it
was
regarded
as
a
measure
of
national
growth
and
expansion
the
strength
of
the
conservative
party
from
to
was
largely
due
to
its
adoption
of
the
vital
principle
and
spirit
of
canada
first
the
attacks
upon
the
canada
first
party
also
had
the
effect
of
fixing
in
the
public
mind
a
picture
of
george
brown
as
a
dictator
and
a
relentless
wielder
of
the
party
whip
a
picture
contrasting
strangely
with
those
suggested
by
his
early
career
he
had
fought
for
responsible
government
for
freedom
from
clerical
dictation
he
had
been
one
of
the
boldest
of
rebels
against
party
discipline
he
had
carelessly
thrown
away
a
great
party
advantage
in
order
to
promote
confederation
he
had
been
the
steady
opponent
of
slavery
in
the
liberals
were
in
power
both
at
ottawa
and
at
toronto
and
brown
may
not
have
been
free
from
the
party
man
delusion
that
when
his
party
is
in
power
all
is
well
and
agitation
for
change
is
mischievous
canada
first
threatened
to
change
the
formation
of
political
parties
and
seemed
to
him
to
threaten
a
change
in
the
relations
of
canada
to
the
empire
but
these
explanations
do
not
alter
the
fact
that
his
attitude
caused
the
liberal
party
to
lose
touch
with
a
movement
characterized
by
intellectual
keenness
and
generosity
of
sentiment
representing
a
real
though
national
impulse
and
destined
to
leave
its
mark
upon
the
history
of
the
country
chapter
xxiv
later
years
in
the
preceding
chapters
it
has
been
necessary
to
follow
closely
the
numerous
public
movements
with
which
brown
was
connected
here
we
may
pause
and
consider
some
incidents
of
his
life
and
some
aspects
of
his
character
which
lie
outside
of
these
main
streams
of
action
first
a
few
words
about
the
brown
household
of
the
relations
between
father
and
son
something
has
already
been
said
of
his
mother
alexander
mackenzie
says
we
may
assume
that
brown
derived
much
of
his
energy
power
and
religious
zeal
from
his
half
celtic
origin
these
qualities
he
possessed
in
an
eminent
degree
united
with
the
proverbial
caution
and
prudence
of
the
lowlander
the
children
in
the
order
of
age
were
jane
married
to
george
mackenzie
of
new
york
george
isabella
married
to
thomas
henning
katherine
who
died
unmarried
marianne
married
to
the
rev
ball
and
john
gordon
there
were
no
idlers
in
that
family
the
publication
of
the
in
the
early
days
involved
a
tremendous
struggle
peter
brown
lent
a
hand
in
the
business
as
well
as
in
the
editorial
department
of
the
paper
a
good
deal
of
the
writing
in
the
and
the
early
seems
to
bear
the
marks
of
his
broad
liberalism
and
his
passionate
love
of
freedom
gordon
entered
the
office
as
a
boy
and
rose
to
be
managing
editor
three
of
the
daughters
conducted
a
school
which
enjoyed
an
excellent
reputation
for
thoroughness
katherine
the
third
daughter
was
killed
in
a
railway
accident
at
syracuse
and
the
shock
seriously
affected
the
health
of
the
father
who
died
in
the
mother
had
died
in
the
previous
year
by
these
events
and
by
marriages
the
busy
household
was
broken
up
george
brown
as
we
have
seen
married
in
and
from
that
time
until
his
death
his
letters
to
his
wife
and
children
show
an
intense
affection
and
love
of
home
after
her
husband
death
brown
resided
in
edinburgh
where
she
died
on
may
the
only
son

from
george
brown
was
busily
engaged
in
public
life
and
a
large
part
of
the
work
of
the
newspaper
must
have
fallen
on
other
shoulders
there
are
articles
in
which
one
may
fancy
he
detects
the
french
neatness
of
william
macdougall
george
sheppard
spoke
at
the
convention
of
like
a
statesman
and
he
and
macdougall
had
higher
qualities
than
mere
facility
with
the
pen
gordon
brown
gradually
grew
into
the
editorship
he
had
says
thomson
writing
of
a
later
period
a
singular
power
of
utilizing
suggestions
combining
several
that
were
evidently
not
associated
and
indicating
how
they
could
be
merged
in
a
striking
manner
he
seems
to
me
now
to
have
been
the
greatest
editor
i
have
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
at
work
and
in
the
political
department
superior
to
any
of
the
old
or
of
the
new
time
in
north
america
except
only
horace
greeley
but
thomson
thinks
that
like
most
of
the
he
took
his
politics
a
little
too
hard
gordon
brown
died
in
june
brown
regarded
his
defeat
in
south
ontario
in
as
an
opportunity
to
retire
from
parliamentary
life
he
had
expressed
that
intention
several
months
before
he
wrote
to
holton
on
may
my
fixed
determination
is
to
see
the
liberal
party
and
in
the
ascendant
and
then
make
my
bow
as
a
politician
as
a
journalist
and
a
citizen
i
hope
always
to
be
found
on
the
right
side
and
heartily
supporting
my
old
friends
but
i
want
to
be
free
to
write
of
men
and
things
without
control
beyond
that
which
my
conscientious
convictions
and
the
interests
of
my
country
demand
to
be
debarred
by
fear
of
injuring
the
party
from
saying
that
is
unfit
to
sit
in
parliament
and
that
is
very
stupid
makes
journalism
a
very
small
business
party
leadership
and
the
conducting
of
a
great
journal
do
not
harmonize
in
his
speech
at
the
convention
of
he
said
that
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
triumph
of
representation
by
population
as
the
day
of
his
emancipation
from
parliamentary
life
but
that
the
case
was
altered
by
the
proposal
to
continue
the
coalition
involving
a
secession
from
the
ranks
of
the
liberal
party
in
this
juncture
it
was
necessary
for
liberals
to
unite
and
consult
and
if
it
were
found
that
his
continuance
in
parliamentary
life
for
a
short
time
would
be
a
service
to
the
party
he
would
not
refuse
it
would
be
impossible
however
for
him
to
accept
any
official
position
and
he
did
not
wish
by
remaining
in
parliament
to
stand
in
the
way
of
those
who
would
otherwise
become
leaders
of
the
party
he
again
emphasized
the
difficulty
of
combining
the
functions
of
leadership
of
a
party
and
management
of
a
newspaper
the
sentiments
of
the
leader
of
a
party
are
only
known
from
his
public
utterances
on
public
occasions
if
a
wrong
act
is
committed
by
an
opponent
or
by
a
friend
he
may
simply
shrug
his
shoulders
but
it
was
otherwise
with
the
journalist
he
had
been
accused
of
fierce
assaults
on
public
men
but
i
tell
you
if
the
daily
thoughts
and
the
words
daily
uttered
by
other
public
men
were
written
in
a
book
as
mine
have
been
and
circulated
all
over
the
country
there
would
have
been
a
very
different
comparison
between
them
and
myself
i
have
had
a
double
duty
to
perform
if
i
had
been
simply
the
leader
of
a
party
and
had
not
controlled
a
public
journal
such
things
would
not
have
been
left
on
record
i
might
have
passed
my
observations
in
private
conversation
and
no
more
would
have
been
heard
of
them
but
as
a
journalist
it
was
necessary
i
should
speak
the
truth
before
the
people
no
matter
whether
it
helped
my
party
or
not
and
this
of
course
reflected
on
the
position
of
the
party
consequently
i
have
long
felt
very
strongly
that
i
had
to
choose
one
position
or
the
other
that
of
a
leader
in
parliamentary
life
or
that
of
a
monitor
in
the
public
press
and
the
latter
has
been
my
choice
being
probably
more
in
consonance
with
my
ardent
temperament
and
at
the
same
time
in
my
opinion
more
influential
for
i
am
free
to
say
that
in
view
of
all
the
grand
offices
that
are
now
talked
of
governorships
premierships
and
the
like
i
would
rather
be
editor
of
the
with
the
hearty
confidence
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
of
upper
canada
than
have
the
choice
of
them
all
of
brown
relations
with
the
parliamentary
leaders
after
his
retirement
mackenzie
says
nor
did
he
ever
in
after
years
attempt
to
control
or
influence
parliamentary
proceedings
as
conducted
by
the
liberals
in
opposition
or
in
the
government
while
always
willing
to
give
his
opinion
when
asked
on
any
particular
question
he
never
volunteered
his
advice
his
opinions
of
course
received
free
utterance
in
the
which
was
more
unfettered
by
reason
of
his
absence
from
parliamentary
duties
though
even
there
it
was
rarely
indeed
that
any
articles
were
published
which
were
calculated
to
inconvenience
or
discomfort
those
who
occupied
his
former
position
left
comparatively
free
to
follow
his
own
inclinations
brown
plunged
into
farming
spending
money
and
energy
freely
in
the
raising
of
fine
cattle
on
his
bow
park
estate
near
brantford
an
extensive
business
which
ultimately
led
to
the
formation
of
a
joint
stock
company
the
province
of
ontario
especially
western
ontario
was
for
him
the
object
of
an
intense
local
patriotism
he
loved
to
travel
over
it
and
to
meet
the
people
it
was
noticed
in
the
office
that
he
paid
special
attention
to
the
weekly
edition
of
the
paper
as
that
which
reached
the
farming
community
his
bow
park
enterprise
gave
him
an
increased
feeling
of
kinship
and
sympathy
with
that
community
and
he
delighted
in
showing
farmers
over
the
estate
it
would
be
hard
to
draw
a
more
characteristic
picture
than
that
of
the
tall
senator
striding
over
the
fields
talking
of
cattle
and
crops
with
all
the
energy
with
which
he
was
wont
to
denounce
the
tories
brown
was
appointed
to
the
senate
in
december
except
for
the
speech
on
reciprocity
which
is
dealt
with
elsewhere
his
career
there
was
not
noteworthy
he
seems
to
have
taken
no
part
in
the
discussion
on
senator
vidal
resolution
in
favour
of
prohibition
or
on
the
scott
act
a
measure
for
introducing
prohibition
by
local
option
a
popular
conception
of
brown
as
an
ardent
advocate
of
legislative
prohibition
may
have
been
derived
from
some
speeches
made
in
his
early
career
and
from
an
early
prospectus
of
the
on
the
bill
providing
for
government
of
the
territories
he
made
a
speech
against
the
provision
for
separate
schools
warning
the
house
that
the
effect
would
be
to
fasten
these
institutions
on
the
west
in
perpetuity
in
senator
brown
figured
in
a
remarkable
case
of
contempt
of
court
a
bowmanville
newspaper
had
charged
senator
simpson
a
political
ally
of
brown
with
resorting
to
bribery
in
the
general
election
of
it
published
also
a
letter
from
senator
brown
to
senator
simpson
asking
him
for
a
subscription
towards
the
liberal
campaign
fund
on
senator
simpson
application
wilkinson
the
editor
of
the
paper
was
called
upon
to
show
cause
why
a
criminal
information
should
not
issue
against
him
for
libel
the
case
was
argued
before
the
queen
bench
composed
of
harrison
justice
morrison
and
justice
wilson
the
judgment
of
the
court
delivered
by
the
was
against
the
editor
in
regard
to
two
of
the
articles
complained
of
and
in
his
favour
in
regard
to
the
third
in
following
the
justice
wilson
took
occasion
to
refer
to
senator
brown
letter
and
to
say
that
it
was
written
with
corrupt
intent
to
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
elections
brown
was
not
the
man
to
allow
a
charge
of
this
kind
to
go
unanswered
and
in
this
case
there
were
special
circumstances
calculated
to
arouse
his
anger
the
publication
of
his
letter
in
the
bowmanville
paper
had
been
the
signal
for
a
fierce
attack
upon
him
by
the
conservative
press
of
the
province
it
appeared
to
him
that
justice
wilson
had
wantonly
made
himself
a
participant
in
this
attack
lending
the
weight
of
his
judicial
influence
to
his
enemies
interest
was
added
to
the
case
by
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
been
in
previous
years
supported
by
the
in
municipal
and
parliamentary
elections
he
had
been
in
the
government
from
may
to
may
judge
morrison
had
been
under
hincks
and
afterwards
a
colleague
of
john
macdonald
each
of
them
in
this
case
took
a
course
opposite
to
that
which
might
have
been
expected
from
old
political
associations
a
few
days
afterwards
the
contained
a
long
carefully
prepared
and
powerful
attack
upon
justice
wilson
beginning
with
a
tribute
to
the
bench
of
ontario
it
declared
that
no
fault
was
to
be
found
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
that
the
offence
lay
in
the
gratuitous
comments
of
justice
wilson
no
sooner
had
the
finished
than
justice
wilson
availed
himself
of
the
occasion
to
express
his
views
of
the
matter
with
a
freedom
of
speech
and
an
indifference
to
the
evidence
before
the
court
and
an
indulgence
in
assumptions
surmises
and
insinuations
that
we
believe
to
be
totally
unparalleled
in
the
judicial
proceedings
of
any
canadian
court
the
article
denied
that
the
letter
was
written
with
any
corrupt
intent
and
it
stated
that
the
entire
fund
raised
by
the
liberal
party
in
the
general
election
of
was
only
three
thousand
seven
hundred
dollars
or
dollars
for
each
of
the
constituencies
this
justice
wilson
may
rest
assured
of
that
such
slanders
and
insults
shall
not
go
unanswered
and
if
the
dignity
of
the
bench
is
ruffled
in
the
tussle
on
his
folly
shall
rest
the
blame
we
cast
back
on
wilson
his
insolent
and
slanderous
interpretation
the
letter
was
not
written
for
corrupt
purposes
it
was
not
written
to
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
elections
it
was
not
an
invitation
to
anybody
to
concur
in
committing
bribery
and
corruption
at
the
polls
and
be
he
judge
or
not
who
says
so
this
statement
is
false
the
writer
went
on
to
contend
that
there
were
perfectly
legitimate
expenditures
in
keenly
contested
elections
was
there
no
such
fund
when
justice
wilson
was
in
public
life
when
the
hat
went
round
in
his
contest
for
the
mayoralty
was
that
or
was
it
not
a
concurrence
in
bribery
or
corruption
at
the
polls
justice
wilson
had
justified
his
comment
by
declaring
that
he
might
take
notice
of
matters
with
which
every
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
was
acquainted
fastening
upon
these
words
the
asked
how
could
justice
wilson
in
his
hunt
for
things
which
every
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
is
acquainted
with
omit
to
state
that
while
the
entire
general
election
fund
of
the
liberal
party
for
that
year
was
but
three
thousand
seven
hundred
dollars
raised
by
subscription
from
a
few
private
individuals
the
conservative
fund
on
the
same
occasion
amounted
to
the
enormous
sum
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
raised
by
the
flagitious
sale
of
the
pacific
railway
contract
to
a
band
of
speculators
on
terms
disastrous
to
the
interests
of
the
country
in
another
vigorous
paragraph
the
writer
said
we
deeply
regret
being
compelled
to
write
of
the
conduct
of
any
member
of
the
ontario
bench
in
the
tone
of
this
article
but
the
offence
was
so
rank
so
reckless
so
utterly
unjustifiable
that
soft
words
would
have
but
poorly
discharged
our
duty
to
the
public
no
proceedings
were
taken
in
regard
to
this
article
until
about
five
months
afterwards
when
wilkinson
the
editor
of
the
bowmanville
paper
applied
to
have
brown
committed
for
contempt
of
court
the
judge
assailed
took
no
action
and
the
case
was
tried
before
his
colleagues
harrison
and
judge
morrison
brown
appeared
in
person
and
made
an
argument
occupying
portions
of
two
days
he
pointed
out
that
the
application
had
been
delayed
five
months
after
the
publication
of
the
article
he
contended
that
wilkinson
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
article
and
had
no
standing
in
the
case
in
a
lengthy
affidavit
he
entered
into
the
whole
question
of
the
expenditure
of
the
two
parties
in
the
election
of
including
the
circumstances
of
the
pacific
scandal
he
repeated
on
oath
the
statement
made
in
the
article
that
his
letter
was
not
written
with
corrupt
intent
that
the
subscription
asked
for
was
for
legitimate
purposes
and
that
it
was
part
of
a
fund
amounting
to
only
three
thousand
seven
hundred
dollars
for
the
whole
province
of
ontario
he
boldly
justified
the
article
as
provoked
by
justice
wilson
dictum
and
by
the
use
that
would
be
made
of
it
by
hostile
politicians
the
judge
had
chosen
to
intervene
in
a
keen
political
controversy
whose
range
extended
to
the
pacific
scandal
and
in
defending
himself
from
his
enemies
and
the
enemies
of
his
party
brown
was
forced
to
answer
the
judge
he
argued
that
to
compel
an
editor
to
keep
silence
in
such
a
case
would
not
only
be
unjust
to
him
but
contrary
to
public
policy
for
instance
the
discussion
of
a
great
public
question
such
as
that
involved
in
the
pacific
scandal
might
be
stopped
upon
the
application
of
a
party
to
a
suit
in
which
that
question
was
incidentally
raised
the
case
was
presented
with
his
accustomed
energy
and
thoroughness
from
the
point
of
view
of
journalistic
duty
of
politics
and
of
law
for
brown
was
not
afraid
to
tread
that
sacred
ground
and
give
extensive
citations
from
the
law
reports
his
address
may
be
commended
to
any
editor
who
may
be
pursued
by
that
mysterious
legal
phantom
a
charge
of
contempt
of
court
the
energy
of
his
gestures
the
shaking
of
the
white
head
and
the
swinging
of
the
long
arms
must
have
somewhat
startled
osgoode
hall
the
court
was
divided
the
ruling
that
there
had
been
contempt
justice
morrison
contra
and
justice
wilson
taking
no
part
in
the
proceedings
so
the
matter
dropped
though
not
out

and

conclusion
the
building
in
which
the
life
of
the
hon
george
brown
was
so
tragically
ended
was
one
that
had
been
presented
to
him
by
the
reformers
of
upper
canada
before
confederation
as
a
mark
of
the
high
sense
entertained
by
his
political
friends
of
the
long
faithful
and
important
services
which
he
has
rendered
to
the
people
of
canada
it
stood
upon
the
north
side
of
king
street
on
ground
which
is
now
the
lower
end
of
victoria
street
for
the
purpose
of
extending
which
the
building
was
demolished
the
ground
floor
was
occupied
by
the
business
office
on
the
next
looking
out
upon
king
street
was
private
office
and
above
that
the
rooms
occupied
by
the
editorial
staff
with
the
composing
room
in
the
rear
at
about
half
past
four
on
the
afternoon
of
march
several
of
the
occupants
of
the
editorial
rooms
heard
a
shot
followed
by
a
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
cries
of
help
and
murder
among
these
were
avern
pardoe
now
librarian
of
the
legislative
assembly
of
ontario
archibald
blue
now
head
of
the
census
bureau
at
ottawa
john
ewan
now
leader
writer
on
the
and
allan
thompson
father
of
the
present
foreman
of
the
composing
room
ewan
and
thompson
were
first
to
arrive
on
the
scene
following
the
direction
from
which
the
sounds
proceeded
they
found
brown
on
the
landing
struggling
with
an
undersized
man
whose
head
was
thrust
into
brown
breast
ewan
and
thompson
seized
the
man
while
brown
himself
wrested
a
smoking
pistol
from
his
hand
blue
pardoe
and
others
quickly
joined
the
group
and
brown
though
not
apparently
severely
injured
was
induced
to
lie
on
the
sofa
in
his
room
where
his
wound
was
examined
the
bullet
had
passed
through
the
outer
side
of
the
left
thigh
about
four
inches
downward
and
backward
it
was
found
on
the
floor
of
the
office
the
assailant
was
george
bennett
who
had
been
employed
in
the
engine
room
of
the
for
some
years
and
had
been
discharged
for
intemperance
brown
said
that
when
bennett
entered
the
office
he
proceeded
to
shut
the
door
behind
him
thinking
the
man
movements
singular
brown
stopped
him
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
bennett
after
some
hesitation
presented
a
paper
for
brown
signature
saying
that
it
was
a
statement
that
he
had
been
employed
in
the
for
five
years
brown
said
he
should
apply
to
the
head
of
the
department
in
which
he
was
employed
bennett
said
that
the
head
of
the
department
had
refused
to
give
the
certificate
brown
then
told
him
to
apply
to
henning
the
treasurer
of
the
company
who
could
furnish
the
information
by
examining
his
books
bennett
kept
insisting
that
brown
should
sign
the
paper
and
finally
began
to
fumble
in
his
pistol
pocket
whereupon
it
passed
through
brown
mind
that
the
little
wretch
might
be
meaning
to
shoot
me
as
he
got
the
pistol
out
brown
seized
his
wrist
and
turned
his
hand
downward
after
one
shot
had
been
fired
the
struggle
continued
until
the
two
got
outside
the
landing
where
they
were
found
as
already
described
the
bullet
had
struck
no
vital
part
and
the
wound
was
not
considered
to
be
mortal
but
as
week
after
week
passed
without
substantial
improvement
the
anxiety
of
his
friends
and
of
the
country
deepened
at
the
trial
the
question
was
raised
whether
recovery
had
been
prevented
by
the
fact
that
brown
against
the
advice
of
his
physician
transacted
business
in
his
room
after
the
first
eight
or
ten
days
there
were
intervals
of
delirium
towards
the
end
of
april
when
the
case
looked
very
serious
brown
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
rev
greig
his
old
pastor
and
with
members
of
his
family
in
that
conversation
says
mackenzie
he
spoke
freely
to
them
of
his
faith
and
hope
and
we
are
told
poured
out
his
soul
in
full
and
fervent
prayer
and
he
joined
heartily
in
the
singing
of
the
hymn
rock
of
ages
a
few
days
afterwards
he
became
unconscious
the
physicians
ceased
to
press
stimulants
or
nourishment
upon
him
and
early
on
sunday
may
he
passed
away
bennett
was
tried
and
found
guilty
of
murder
on
june
following
and
was
executed
a
month
afterwards
though
he
caused
the
death
of
a
man
so
conspicuous
in
the
public
life
of
canada
his
act
is
not
to
be
classed
with
assassinations
committed
from
political
motives
or
even
from
love
of
notoriety
on
the
scaffold
he
said
that
he
had
not
intended
to
kill
brown
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
it
was
not
any
act
of
brown
that
set
up
that
process
of
brooding
over
grievances
that
had
so
tragic
an
ending
by
misfortune
and
by
drinking
a
mind
naturally
had
been
reduced
to
that
condition
in
which
enemies
are
seen
on
every
hand
a
paper
was
found
upon
him
in
which
he
set
forth
a
maniacal
plan
of
murdering
a
supposed
enemy
and
concealing
the
remains
in
the
furnace
of
the
building
that
the
original
object
of
his
enmity
was
not
brown
is
certain
there
was
not
the
slightest
ground
for
the
suspicion
that
the
victim
was
made
to
suffer
for
some
enmity
aroused
in
his
strenuous
career
as
a
public
man
strange
that
after
such
a
career
he
should
meet
a
violent
death
at
the
hands
of
a
man
who
was
thinking
solely
of
private
grievances
tracing
brown
career
through
a
long
period
of
history
by
his
public
actions
his
speeches
and
the
volumes
of
his
newspaper
one
arrives
at
a
somewhat
different
estimate
from
that
preserved
in
familiar
gossip
and
tradition
that
tradition
pictures
a
man
impulsive
stormy
imperious
bearing
down
by
sheer
force
all
opposition
to
his
will
in
the
main
it
is
probably
true
but
the
printed
record
is
also
true
and
out
of
the
two
we
must
strive
to
reproduce
the
man
we
are
told
of
a
speech
delivered
with
flashing
eye
with
gestures
that
seemed
almost
to
threaten
physical
violence
we
read
the
report
of
the
speech
and
we
find
something
more
than
the
ordinary
transition
from
warm
humanity
to
cold
print
there
is
not
only
freedom
from
violence
but
there
is
coherence
close
reasoning
a
systematic
marshalling
of
facts
and
figures
and
arguments
one
might
say
of
many
of
his
speeches
as
was
said
of
alexander
sentences
that
he
built
them
as
he
built
a
stone
wall
his
tremendous
energy
was
not
spasmodic
but
was
backed
by
solid
industry
method
and
persistence
as
bengough
said
in
a
little
poem
published
soon
after
death
his
nature
was
a
rushing
mountain
stream
his
faults
but
eddies
which
its
swiftness
bred
in
his
business
as
a
journalist
he
had
not
much
of
that
philosophy
which
says
that
the
daily
difficulties
of
a
newspaper
are
sure
to
solve
themselves
by
the
effluxion
of
time
there
are
traditions
of
his
impatience
and
his
outbreaks
of
wrath
when
something
went
wrong
but
there
are
traditions
also
of
a
kindness
large
enough
to
include
the
lad
who
carried
the
proofs
to
his
house
those
who
were
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
the
office
say
that
he
was
extremely
lenient
with
employees
who
were
intemperate
or
otherwise
incurred
blame
and
that
his
leniency
had
been
extended
to
bennett
intimate
friends
and
political
associates
deny
that
he
played
the
dictator
and
say
that
he
was
genial
and
humorous
in
familiar
intercourse
but
it
is
after
all
a
somewhat
unprofitable
task
to
endeavour
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
personal
character
of
a
public
man
placing
this
virtue
against
that
fault
and
solemnly
assuming
to
decide
which
side
of
the
ledger
exceeds
the
other
we
have
to
deal
with
the
character
of
brown
as
a
force
in
its
relation
to
other
forces
and
to
the
events
of
the
period
of
history
covered
by
his
career
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
now
elapsed
since
the
death
of
george
brown
and
a
still
longer
time
since
the
most
stirring
scenes
in
his
career
were
enacted
we
ought
therefore
to
be
able
to
see
him
in
something
like
his
true
relation
to
the
history
of
his
times
he
came
to
canada
at
a
time
when
the
notion
of
colonial
was
regarded
as
a
startling
innovation
he
found
among
the
dominant
class
a
curious
revival
of
the
famous
stuart
doctrine
no
bishop
no
king
hence
the
rise
of
such
leaders
partly
political
and
partly
religious
as
bishop
strachan
among
the
anglicans
and
ryerson
among
the
methodists
the
former
vindicating
and
the
latter
challenging
the
exclusive
privileges
of
the
anglican
church
there
was
room
for
a
similar
leader
among
presbyterians
and
in
a
certain
sense
this
was
the
opportunity
of
george
brown
in
founding
first
a
presbyterian
paper
and
afterwards
a
political
paper
he
was
following
a
line
familiar
to
the
people
of
his
time
but
while
he
had
a
special
influence
among
presbyterians
he
appeared
not
as
claiming
special
privileges
for
them
but
as
the
opponent
of
all
privilege
fighting
first
the
anglican
church
and
afterwards
the
roman
catholic
church
and
asserting
in
each
case
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state
for
some
years
after
brown
arrival
in
canada
those
questions
in
which
politics
and
religion
were
blended
were
subordinated
to
a
question
purely
political
colonial
the
atmosphere
was
not
favourable
to
cool
discussion
the
colony
had
been
in
rebellion
and
the
passions
aroused
by
the
rebellion
were
always
ready
to
burst
into
flame
french
canada
having
been
more
deeply
stirred
by
the
rebellion
than
upper
canada
racial
animosity
was
added
there
to
party
bitterness
the
task
of
the
reformers
was
to
work
steadily
for
the
establishment
of
a
new
order
involving
a
highly
important
principle
of
government
and
at
the
same
time
to
keep
the
movement
free
from
all
suspicion
of
incitement
to
rebellion
the
leading
figure
of
this
movement
is
that
of
robert
baldwin
and
he
was
well
supported
by
hincks
by
sullivan
by
william
hume
blake
and
others
the
forces
were
wisely
led
and
it
is
not
pretended
that
this
direction
was
due
to
brown
he
was
in
only
years
of
age
and
his
position
at
first
was
that
of
a
recruit
but
he
was
a
recruit
of
uncommon
vigour
and
steadiness
and
though
he
did
not
originate
he
emphasized
the
idea
of
carrying
on
the
fight
on
strictly
constitutional
and
peaceful
lines
his
experience
in
new
york
and
his
deep
hatred
of
slavery
had
strengthened
by
contrast
his
conviction
that
great
britain
was
the
citadel
of
liberty
and
hence
his
utterances
in
favour
of
british
connection
were
not
conventional
but
glowed
with
enthusiasm
with
came
the
triumph
of
reform
and
the
last
despairing
effort
of
the
old
régime
dying
out
with
the
flames
of
the
parliament
buildings
at
montreal
now
ensued
a
change
in
both
parties
the
one
exhausted
and
discredited
by
its
fight
against
the
inevitable
coming
of
the
new
order
remained
for
a
time
weak
and
inactive
under
a
leader
whose
day
was
done
the
other
in
the
very
hour
of
victory
began
to
suffer
disintegration
it
had
its
conservative
element
desiring
to
rest
and
be
thankful
and
its
radical
element
with
aims
not
unlike
those
of
chartism
in
england
brown
stood
for
a
time
between
the
government
and
the
conservative
element
on
the
one
side
and
the
clear
grits
on
the
other
disintegration
was
hastened
by
the
retirement
of
baldwin
and
lafontaine
then
came
the
brief
and
troubled
reign
of
hincks
then
a
reconstruction
of
parties
with
conservatives
under
the
leadership
of
macdonald
and
reformers
under
that
of
brown
the
stream
of
politics
between
and
is
turbid
there
is
pettiness
there
is
bitterness
there
is
confusion
but
away
from
this
turmoil
the
province
is
growing
in
population
in
wealth
in
all
the
elements
of
civilization
upper
canada
especially
is
growing
by
immigration
it
overtakes
and
passes
lower
canada
in
population
and
thus
arises
the
question
of
representation
by
population
brown
takes
up
this
reform
in
representation
as
a
means
of
freeing
upper
canada
from
the
domination
of
the
lower
province
he
becomes
the
favourite
son
of
upper
canada
his
rival
through
his
alliance
meets
him
with
a
majority
from
lower
canada
and
so
for
several
years
there
is
a
period
of
equally
balanced
parties
and
weak
governments
ending
in
if
brown
action
had
only
broken
this
extricated
some
struggling
politicians
from
difficulty
and
allowed
the
ordinary
business
of
government
to
proceed
it
might
have
deserved
only
passing
notice
but
more
than
that
was
involved
the
difficulty
was
inherent
in
the
system
the
legislative
union
was
lord
durham
plan
of
assimilating
the
races
that
he
had
found
warring
in
the
bosom
of
a
single
state
the
plan
had
failed
the
line
of
cleavage
was
as
sharply
defined
as
ever
the
union
had
produced
only
strife
and
misunderstanding
yet
to
break
the
tie
when
new
duties
and
new
dangers
had
emphasized
the
necessity
for
union
seemed
to
be
an
act
of
folly
to
federalize
the
union
was
to
combine
the
advantage
of
common
action
with
liberty
to
each
community
to
work
out
its
own
ideals
in
education
municipal
government
and
all
other
matters
of
local
concern
more
than
that
to
federalize
the
union
was
to
substitute
for
a
rigid
bond
a
bond
elastic
enough
to
allow
of
expansion
eastward
to
the
atlantic
and
westward
to
the
pacific
that
principle
which
has
been
called
provincial
rights
or
provincial
autonomy
might
be
described
more
accurately
and
comprehensively
as
federalism
and
it
is
the
basic
principle
of
canadian
political
institutions
as
essential
to
unity
as
to
peace
and
local
freedom
the
feeble
isolated
and
distracted
colonies
of
have
given
place
to
a
commonwealth
which
if
not
in
strictness
a
nation
possesses
all
the
elements
and
possibilities
of
nationality
with
a
territory
open
on
three
sides
to
the
ocean
lying
in
the
highway
of
the
commerce
and
capable
of
supporting
a
population
as
large
as
that
of
the
british
islands
confederation
was
the
first
and
greatest
step
in
that
process
of
expansion
and
it
is
speaking
only
words
of
truth
and
soberness
to
say
that
confederation
will
rank
among
the
landmarks
of
the
world
history
and
that
its
importance
will
not
decline
but
will
increase
as
history
throws
events
into
their
true
perspective
it
is
in
his
association
with
confederation
with
the
events
that
led
up
to
confederation
and
with
the
addition
to
canada
of
the
vast
and
fertile
plains
of
the
west
that
the
life
of
george
brown
is
of
interest
to
the
student
of
history
brown
was
not
only
a
member
of
parliament
and
an
actor
in
the
political
drama
but
was
the
founder
of
a
newspaper
and
for
years
the
source
of
its
inspiration
and
influence
as
a
journalist
he
touched
life
at
many
points
he
was
a
man
of
varied
interests
railways
municipal
affairs
prison
reform
education
agriculture
all
came
within
the
range
of
his
duty
as
a
journalist
and
his
interest
and
sympathy
as
a
man
those
men
who
amid
all
the
wrangling
and
intrigue
of
the
politicians
were
turning
the
wilderness
of
canada
into
a
garden
gave
to
brown
in
large
measure
their
confidence
and
affection
he
on
his
part
valued
their
friendship
more
than
any
victory
that
could
be
won
in
the
political
game
that
was
the
standard
by
which
he
always
asked
to
be
judged
this
story
of
his
life
may
help
to
show
that
he
was
true
to
the
trust
they
reposed
in
him
and
to
the
principles
that
were
the
standards
of
his
political
conduct
to
government
by
the
people
to
free
institutions
to
religious
liberty
and
equality
to
