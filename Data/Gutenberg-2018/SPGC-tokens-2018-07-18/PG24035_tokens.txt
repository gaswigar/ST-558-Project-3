the
pirates
of
ersatz
by
murray
leinster
illustration
it
seems
nobody
loves
a
benefactor
particularly
nobody
on
a
planet
grandpa
always
said
pirates
were
really
benefactors
though
illustrated
by
freas
i
it
was
not
mere
impulsive
action
when
bron
hoddan
started
for
the
planet
walden
by
stowing
away
on
a
ship
that
had
come
to
his
native
planet
to
hang
all
his
relatives
he
planned
it
long
before
it
was
a
and
carefully
worked
out
scheme
he
did
expect
the
hanging
of
his
relatives
of
course
he
knew
that
they
act
grieved
and
innocent
and
give
proof
that
they
were
simple
people
leading
blameless
lives
they
make
their
executioners
feel
ashamed
and
apologetic
for
having
thought
evil
of
them
and
as
soon
as
the
strangers
left
they
return
to
their
normal
way
of
life
which
was
piracy
but
while
this
was
going
on
bron
hoddan
stowed
away
on
the
menacing
vessel
presently
he
arrived
at
its
home
world
but
his
ambition
was
to
reach
walden
so
he
set
about
getting
there
it
took
a
long
time
because
he
had
to
earn
from
one
solar
system
to
another
but
he
held
to
his
idea
walden
was
the
most
civilized
planet
in
that
part
of
the
galaxy
on
walden
hoddan
intended
in
order
a
to
achieve
splendid
things
as
an
electronic
engineer
b
to
grow
satisfactorily
rich
c
to
marry
a
delightful
girl
and
d
end
his
life
a
great
man
but
he
had
to
spend
two
years
trying
to
arrange
even
the
first
on
the
night
before
the
police
broke
in
the
door
of
his
room
though
accomplishment
seemed
imminent
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
he
was
calmly
sure
that
his
ambitions
were
about
to
be
realized
at
practically
any
instant
his
brilliance
would
be
discovered
and
he
be
his
friend
derec
would
admire
him
and
even
nedda
would
probably
decide
to
marry
him
right
away
she
was
the
delightful
girl
such
prospects
made
for
good
sleeping
and
walden
was
a
fine
world
to
be
sleeping
on
outside
the
capital
city
its
spaceport
received
shipments
of
luxuries
and
raw
materials
from
halfway
across
the
galaxy
its
landing
grid
reared
skyward
and
tapped
the
planet
ionosphere
for
power
with
which
to
hoist
ships
to
clear
space
and
pluck
down
others
from
emptiness
there
was
commerce
and
manufacture
and
wealth
and
culture
and
walden
modestly
admitted
that
its
standard
of
living
was
the
highest
in
the
nurmi
cluster
its
citizens
had
no
reason
to
worry
about
anything
but
a
supply
of
tranquilizers
to
enable
them
to
stand
the
boredom
of
their
lives
even
hoddan
was
satisfied
as
of
the
moment
on
his
native
planet
there
was
even
a
landing
grid
the
few
battered
cobbled
ships
the
inhabitants
owned
had
to
take
off
precariously
on
rockets
they
came
back
blackened
and
sometimes
more
battered
still
and
sometimes
they
were
accompanied
by
great
hulls
whose
crews
and
passengers
were
mysteriously
missing
these
extra
ships
had
to
be
landed
on
their
emergency
rockets
and
of
course
could
take
off
again
but
they
always
vanished
quickly
just
the
same
and
the
people
of
zan
on
which
hoddan
had
been
born
always
affected
innocent
indignation
when
embattled
other
spacecraft
came
and
furiously
demanded
that
they
be
produced
there
were
some
people
who
said
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
zan
were
space
pirates
and
ought
to
be
hung
and
compared
with
such
a
planet
walden
seemed
a
very
fine
place
indeed
so
on
a
certain
night
bron
hoddan
went
confidently
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
until
three
hours
after
sunrise
then
the
police
broke
in
his
door
they
made
a
tremendous
crash
in
doing
it
but
they
were
in
great
haste
the
noise
waked
hoddan
and
he
blinked
his
eyes
open
before
he
could
stir
four
uniformed
men
grabbed
him
and
dragged
him
out
of
bed
they
searched
him
frantically
for
anything
like
a
weapon
then
they
stood
him
against
a
wall
with
two
on
him
and
the
main
body
of
cops
began
to
tear
his
room
apart
looking
for
something
he
could
not
guess
then
his
friend
derec
came
hesitantly
in
the
door
and
looked
at
him
remorsefully
he
wrung
his
hands
i
had
to
do
it
bron
he
said
agitatedly
i
could
help
doing
it
hoddan
blinked
at
him
he
was
dazed
things
did
become
clearer
when
he
saw
that
a
cop
had
slit
open
his
pillow
and
was
sifting
its
contents
through
his
fingers
another
cop
was
ripping
the
seams
of
his
mattress
to
look
inside
somebody
else
was
going
carefully
through
a
little
pile
of
notes
that
nedda
had
written
squinting
at
them
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
seeing
something
he
wish
he
had
what
happened
asked
hoddan
blankly
what
this
about
derec
said
miserably
you
killed
someone
bron
an
innocent
man
you
did
mean
to
but
you
did
and
it
terrible
me
kill
somebody
that
ridiculous
protested
hoddan
they
found
him
outside
the
powerhouse
said
derec
bitterly
outside
the
station
that
you
oh
hoddan
was
relieved
it
was
amazing
how
much
he
was
relieved
he
had
an
unbelieving
fear
for
a
moment
that
somebody
might
have
found
out
he
been
born
and
raised
on
zan
which
would
have
ruined
everything
it
was
almost
impossible
to
imagine
but
still
it
was
a
great
relief
to
find
out
he
was
only
suspected
of
a
murder
he
committed
and
he
was
only
suspected
because
his
first
great
achievement
as
an
electronic
engineer
had
been
discovered
they
found
the
thing
at
eh
but
i
did
kill
anybody
and
there
no
harm
done
the
thing
been
running
two
weeks
now
i
was
going
to
the
power
board
in
a
couple
of
days
he
addressed
the
police
i
know
what
up
now
he
said
give
me
some
clothes
and
let
go
get
this
straightened
out
a
cop
waved
a
at
him
one
word
out
of
line
and
do
talk
bron
said
derec
in
panic
just
keep
quiet
it
bad
enough
do
make
it
worse
a
cop
handed
hoddan
a
garment
he
put
it
on
he
became
aware
that
the
cop
was
scared
so
was
derec
everybody
in
the
room
was
scared
except
himself
hoddan
found
himself
incredulous
people
did
act
this
way
on
walden
who
i
kill
he
demanded
and
why
you
would
know
him
bron
said
derec
mournfully
you
did
mean
to
do
murder
but
it
only
luck
that
you
killed
only
him
instead
of
everybody
everybody
hoddan
stared
no
more
talk
snapped
the
nearest
cop
his
teeth
were
chattering
keep
quiet
or
else
hoddan
shut
up
he
watched
dressing
the
while
as
his
clothing
was
inspected
and
then
handed
to
him
while
the
cops
completed
the
examination
of
his
room
they
were
insanely
thorough
though
hoddan
had
the
least
idea
what
they
might
be
looking
for
when
they
began
to
rip
up
the
floor
and
pull
down
the
walls
the
other
cops
led
him
outside
there
was
a
fleet
of
police
trucks
in
the
shaded
street
outdoors
they
piled
him
in
one
and
four
cops
climbed
after
him
keeping
trained
on
him
during
the
maneuver
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
derec
climbing
into
another
truck
the
entire
fleet
sped
away
together
the
whole
affair
had
been
taken
with
enormous
seriousness
by
the
police
traffic
was
detoured
from
their
route
when
they
swung
up
on
an
elevated
expressway
with
trees
on
either
side
there
was
no
other
vehicle
in
sight
they
raced
on
downtown
they
rolled
off
the
expressway
they
rolled
down
a
cleared
avenue
hoddan
recognized
the
detention
building
its
gate
swung
wide
the
truck
he
rode
in
went
inside
the
gate
closed
the
other
trucks
went
away
rapidly
hoddan
alighted
and
saw
that
the
grim
gray
wall
of
the
courtyard
had
a
surprising
number
of
guards
mustered
to
sweep
the
open
space
with
gunfire
if
anybody
made
a
suspicious
movement
he
shook
his
head
nobody
had
mentioned
zan
so
this
simply
did
make
sense
his
conscience
was
wholly
clear
except
about
his
native
planet
this
was
insanity
he
went
curiously
into
the
building
and
into
the
hearing
room
his
guards
there
surrendered
him
to
courtroom
guards
and
went
away
with
almost
hysterical
haste
nobody
wanted
to
be
near
him
hoddan
stared
about
the
courtroom
was
highly
informal
the
justice
sat
at
an
ordinary
desk
there
were
comfortable
chairs
the
air
was
clean
the
atmosphere
was
that
of
a
conference
room
in
which
reasonable
men
could
discuss
differences
of
opinion
in
calm
leisure
only
on
a
world
like
walden
would
a
prisoner
brought
in
by
police
be
dealt
with
in
such
surroundings
derec
came
in
by
another
door
with
a
man
hoddan
recognized
as
the
attorney
who
represented
nedda
father
in
certain
past
interviews
there
been
no
mention
of
nedda
as
toying
with
the
thought
of
marrying
hoddan
then
of
course
it
had
been
strictly
business
nedda
father
was
chairman
of
the
power
board
a
director
of
the
planetary
association
of
manufacturers
a
committeeman
of
the
banker
league
and
other
important
things
hoddan
had
been
thrown
out
of
his
offices
several
times
he
now
scowled
ungraciously
at
the
lawyer
who
had
ordered
him
thrown
out
he
saw
derec
wringing
his
hands
an
agitated
man
in
court
uniform
came
to
his
side
i
the
citizen
representative
he
said
uneasily
i
to
look
after
your
interests
do
you
want
a
personal
lawyer
why
asked
hoddan
he
felt
splendidly
confident
the
charges
do
you
wish
a
psychiatric
examination
claiming
no
responsibility
asked
the
representative
anxiously
it
might
it
might
really
be
best
i
not
crazy
said
hoddan
though
this
looks
like
it
the
citizen
representative
spoke
to
the
justice
sir
the
accused
waives
psychiatric
examination
without
prejudice
to
a
later
claim
of
no
responsibility
nedda
father
attorney
watched
with
bland
eyes
hoddan
said
impatiently
let
get
started
so
this
will
make
some
sense
i
know
what
i
done
what
monstrous
crime
am
i
charged
with
the
charges
against
you
said
the
justice
politely
are
that
on
the
night
of
three
last
you
bron
hoddan
entered
the
grounds
surrounding
the
power
receptor
station
it
is
charged
that
you
passed
two
signs
you
arrived
at
a
door
marked
personnel
only
you
broke
the
lock
of
that
door
inside
you
smashed
the
power
receptor
taking
broadcast
power
from
the
air
this
power
receptor
converts
broadcast
power
for
industrial
units
by
which
two
hundred
thousand
men
are
employed
you
smashed
the
receptor
imperiling
their
employment
the
justice
paused
do
you
wish
to
challenge
any
of
these
charges
as
contrary
to
fact
the
citizen
representative
said
hurriedly
you
have
the
right
to
deny
any
of
them
of
course
why
should
i
asked
hoddan
i
did
them
but
what
this
about
me
killing
somebody
why
they
tear
my
place
apart
looking
for
something
who
i
kill
anyhow
do
bring
that
up
pleaded
the
citizen
representative
please
do
bring
that
up
you
will
be
much
much
better
off
if
that
is
not
mentioned
but
i
did
kill
anybody
insisted
hoddan
nobody
said
a
word
about
it
said
the
citizen
representative
jittering
let
not
have
it
in
the
record
the
record
has
to
be
published
he
turned
to
the
justice
sir
the
facts
are
conceded
as
stated
then
said
the
justice
to
hoddan
do
you
choose
to
answer
these
charges
at
this
time
why
not
asked
hoddan
of
course
proceed
said
the
justice
hoddan
drew
a
deep
breath
he
did
understand
why
a
man
death
charged
to
him
was
not
mentioned
he
did
like
the
scared
way
everybody
looked
at
him
but
about
the
burglary
business
he
said
confidently
what
did
i
do
in
the
power
station
before
i
smashed
the
receptor
the
justice
looked
at
nedda
father
attorney
why
said
that
gentleman
amiably
speaking
for
the
power
board
as
complainant
before
you
smashed
the
standard
receptor
you
connected
a
device
of
your
own
design
across
the
it
was
a
receptor
unit
of
an
apparently
original
pattern
it
appears
to
have
been
a
very
interesting
device
i
offered
it
to
the
power
board
said
hoddan
with
satisfaction
and
i
was
thrown
out
you
had
me
thrown
out
what
did
it
do
it
substituted
for
the
receptor
you
smashed
said
the
attorney
it
continued
to
supply
some
two
hundred
million
kilowatts
for
the
industrial
area
in
fact
your
crime
was
only
discovered
because
the
original
receptor
naturally
had
to
be
set
to
draw
peak
power
at
all
times
with
the
unused
power
wasted
by
burning
carbon
your
device
adjusted
to
the
load
and
did
not
burn
carbon
so
when
the
attendants
went
to
replace
the
supposedly
burned
carbon
and
found
it
unused
they
discovered
what
you
had
done
it
saved
carbon
then
said
hoddan
triumphantly
that
means
it
saved
money
i
saved
the
power
board
plenty
while
that
was
connected
they
would
believe
i
could
now
they
know
i
did
the
justice
said
irrelevant
you
have
heard
the
charges
in
legal
terms
you
are
charged
with
burglary
trespass
breaking
and
entering
unlawful
entry
malicious
mischief
breach
of
the
peace
sabotage
and
endangering
the
employment
of
citizens
discuss
the
charges
please
i
telling
you
protested
hoddan
i
offered
the
thing
to
the
power
board
they
said
they
were
satisfied
with
what
they
had
and
listen
so
i
proved
what
they
would
listen
to
that
receptor
saved
them
ten
thousand
credits
worth
of
carbon
a
week
it
save
half
a
million
credits
a
year
in
every
power
station
that
uses
it
if
i
know
the
power
board
they
going
right
on
using
it
while
they
arrest
me
for
putting
it
to
work
the
courtroom
in
its
entirety
visibly
shivered
are
they
demanded
hoddan
belligerently
they
are
not
said
the
justice
it
has
been
smashed
in
its
turn
it
has
even
been
melted
down
then
look
at
my
patents
insisted
hoddan
it
stupid
the
patent
records
said
the
justice
with
unnecessary
vehemence
have
been
destroyed
your
possessions
have
been
searched
for
copies
nobody
will
ever
look
at
your
drawings
again
not
if
they
are
wise
demanded
hoddan
incredulously
i
will
amend
the
record
of
this
hearing
before
it
is
published
said
the
justice
shakily
i
should
not
have
made
that
comment
i
ask
permission
of
the
citizen
representative
to
amend
granted
said
the
representative
before
he
had
finished
the
justice
said
quickly
he
be
silly
if
he
did
grunted
hoddan
all
right
said
hoddan
indignantly
i
raise
it
somehow
if
too
stupid
to
save
money
how
much
bond
said
the
justice
at
top
speed
he
swallowed
he
did
not
look
at
hoddan
courtroom
guards
put
against
hoddan
body
and
ushered
him
out
presently
his
friend
derec
came
to
see
him
in
the
cell
in
which
he
had
been
placed

white
and
stricken
i
in
trouble
because

friend

i
asked
permission
to
explain
things
to
you
after
all
i
caused
your
arrest
i
urged
you
not
to
connect
up
your
receptor

hoddan
but

did
realize

people

derec
miserably

they
went
to
charge
the
carbon
bins
at
the
power
station

they
found
a
dead
man
bron
hoddan
sat
up
what
that
your
machine
killed
him
he
was
outside
the
building
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
your
receptor
killed
him
through
a
stone
wall
it
broke
his
bones
and
killed
him
bron
derec
wrung
his
hands
at
some
stage
of
your
receptor
makes
deathrays
hoddan
had
had
a
good
many
shocks
today
when
derec
arrived
he
been
incredulously
comparing
the
treatment
he
received
and
the
panic
about
him
with
the
charges
made
against
him
in
court
they
did
add
up
this
new
previously
undisclosed
item

him
speechless
he
goggled
at
derec
who
fairly
wept

to
make
them
this
is
a
wonderful
world
but
there
are
lots
of
crackpots
they
do
anything
the
police
dare
let
it
even
be
suspected
that
deathrays
can
be
made
that
why
you
charged
with
murder
people
all
over
the
planet
would
start
doing
research
hoping
to
satisfy
all
their
grudges
by
committing
suicide
for
all
their
enemies
with
themselves
for
the
sake
of
civilization
your
secret
has
to
be
suppressed
and
you
with
it
it
terrible
for
you
bron
but
there
nothing
else
to
do
hoddan
said
dazedly
but
i
only
have
to
put
up
a
bond
to
be
released
the
the
justice
said
derec
tearfully
did
name
it
in
court
because
it
would
have
to
be
published
but
he
set
your
bond
at
fifty
million
credits
nobody
could
raise
that
for
you
bron
and
with
the
reason
for
it
what
it
is
you
never
be
able
to
get
it
reduced
but
anybody
who
looks
at
the
plans
of
the
receptor
will
know
it
make
deathrays
protested
hoddan
blankly
nobody
will
look
said
derec
tearfully
anybody
who
knows
how
to
make
it
will
have
to
be
locked
up
they
checked
the
patent
examiners
forgotten
nobody
dared
examine
the
device
you
had
working
they
be
jailed
if
they
understood
it
nobody
will
ever
risk
learning
how
to
make
deathrays
not
on
a
world
as
civilized
as
this
with
so
many
people
anxious
to
kill
everybody
else
you
have
to
be
locked
up
forever
bron
you
have
to
hoddan
said
inadequately
oh
i
beg
your
forgiveness
for
having
you
arrested
said
derec
in
abysmal
sorrow
but
i
could
do
anything
but
tell
hoddan
stared
at
his
cell
wall
derec
went
away
weeping
he
was
an
admirable
honorable
young
man
who
had
been
only
friend
hoddan
stared
blankly
at
nothing
as
an
event
it
was
preposterous
and
yet
it
was
wholly
natural
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
somebody
does
something
that
puts
somebody
else
to
the
trouble
of
adjusting
the
numb
routine
of
his
life
the
adjustee
is
resentful
the
richer
he
is
and
the
more
satisfactory
he
considers
his
life
the
more
resentful
he
is
at
any
change
however
minute
and
of
all
the
changes
which
offend
people
changes
which
require
them
to
think
are
most
disliked
the
high
brass
in
the
power
board
considered
that
everything
was
moving
smoothly
there
was
no
need
to
consider
new
devices
hoddan
drawings
and
plans
had
simply
never
been
bothered
with
because
there
was
no
recognized
need
for
them
and
when
he
forced
acknowledgment
that
his
receptor
worked
the
unwelcome
demonstration
was
highly
offensive
in
itself
it
was
natural
it
was
inevitable
it
should
have
been
infallibly
certain
that
any
possible
excuse
for
not
thinking
about
the
receptor
would
be
seized
upon
and
a
single
dead
man
found
near
the
operating
demonstrator
if
one
assumed
that
the
demonstrator
had
killed
him
why
one
could
react
emotionally
feel
vast
indignation
frantically
command
that
the
device
and
its
inventor
be
suppressed
together
and
go
on
living
happily
without
doing
any
thinking
or
making
any
other
change
in
anything
at
all
hoddan
was
appalled
now
that
it
had
happened
he
could
see
that
it
had
to
the
world
of
walden
was
at
the
very
peak
of
human
culture
it
had
arrived
at
so
splendid
a
plane
of
civilization
that
nobody
could
imagine
any
improvement
unless
a
better
tranquilizer
could
be
designed
to
make
it
more
endurable
nobody
ever
really
wants
anything
he
did
think
of
for
himself
nobody
can
want
anything
he
does
know
exists
or
that
he
ca
imagine
to
exist
on
walden
nobody
wanted
anything
unless
it
was
relief
from
the
tedium
of
life
hoddan
electronic
device
did
not
fill
a
human
need
only
a
technical
one
it
had
therefore
no
value
that
would
make
anybody
hospitable
to
it
and
hoddan
would
spend
his
life
in
jail
for
failing
to
recognize
the
fact
he
revolted
immediately
wanted
something
he
wanted
out
and
because
he
was
that
kind
of
man
he
put
his
mind
to
work
devising
something
he
wanted
simply
and
directly
without
trying
to
get
it
by
furnishing
other
people
with
what
they
turned
out
not
to
want
he
set
about
designing
his
escape
with
his
enforced
change
in
viewpoint
he
took
the
view
that
he
must
seem
at
least
to
give
his
captors
and
jailers
and
as
he
saw
it
his
persecutors
what
they
wanted
they
would
be
pleased
to
have
him
dead
provided
their
consciences
were
clear
he
built
on
that
as
a
foundation
very
shortly
before
nightfall
he
performed
certain
cryptic
actions
he
unraveled
threads
from
his
shirt
and
put
them
aside
there
would
be
a
in
the
ceiling
of
his
cell
and
somebody
would
certainly
notice
what
he
did
he
made
a
light
he
put
the
threads
in
his
mouth
set
fire
to
his
mattress
and
laid
down
calmly
upon
it
the
mattress
was
of
excellent
quality
it
would
smell
very
badly
as
it
smoldered
it
did
lying
flat
he
kicked
convulsively
for
a
few
seconds
he
looked
like
somebody
who
had
taken
poison
then
he
waited
it
was
a
rather
long
time
before
his
jailer
came
down
the
cell
corridor
dragging
a
fire
hose
hoddan
had
been
correct
in
assuming
that
he
was
watched
his
actions
had
been
those
of
a
man
who
anticipated
a
possible
need
to
commit
suicide
and
who
had
poison
in
a
part
of
his
shirt
for
convenience
the
jailer
did
not
hurry
because
if
the
inventor
of
a
deathray
committed
suicide
everybody
would
feel
better
hoddan
had
been
allowed
a
reasonable
time
in
which
to
die
he
seemed
impressively
dead
when
the
jailer
opened
his
cell
door
dragged
him
out
removed
the
other
furniture
and
set
up
the
fire
hose
to
make
an
aerosol
fog
which
would
put
out
the
fire
he
went
back
to
the
corridor
to
wait
for
the
fire
to
be
extinguished
hoddan
crowned
him
with
a
stool
feeling
an
unexpected
satisfaction
in
the
act
the
jailer
collapsed
he
did
not
carry
keys
the
system
was
for
him
to
be
let
out
of
this
corridor
by
a
guard
outside
hoddan
growled
and
took
the
fire
hose
he
turned
its
nozzle
back
to
make
a
stream
instead
of
a
mist
water
came
out
at
four
hundred
pounds
pressure
he
smashed
open
the
corridor
door
with
it
he
strolled
through
and
bowled
over
a
startled
guard
with
the
same
stream
he
took
the
guard
he
washed
open
another
door
leading
to
the
courtyard
he
marched
out
washed
down
two
guards
who
sighted
him
and
took
the
trouble
to
flush
them
across
the
pavement
until
they
wedged
in
a
drain
opening
then
he
thoughtfully
reset
the
hose
to
fill
the
courtyard
with
fog
climbed
into
the
driver
seat
of
the
truck
that
had
brought
him
here
it
was
probably
the
same
one
and
smashed
through
the
gateway
to
the
street
outside
behind
him
the
courtyard
filled
with
dense
white
mist
he
was
free
but
only
temporarily
around
him
lay
the
capital
city
of
walden
the
highest
civilization
in
this
part
of
the
galaxy
trees
lined
its
ways
towers
rose
splendidly
toward
the
skies
with
thousands
of
less
ambitious
structures
in
between
there
were
open
squares
and
parkways
and
malls
and
it
did
not
smell
like
a
city
at
all
but
he
was
loose
three
minutes
before
the
communicator
in
the
truck
squawked
the
alarm
for
him
it
was
to
be
expected
all
the
city
would
shortly
be
one
enormous
set
to
catch
bron
hoddan
there
was
only
one
place
on
the
planet
in
fact
where
he
could
be
safe
and
he
would
be
safe
there
if
he
been
officially
charged
with
murder
but
since
the
police
had
tactfully
failed
to
mention
murder
he
could
get
at
least
by
taking
refuge
in
the
interstellar
embassy
he
headed
for
it
bowling
along
splendidly
the
police
truck
hummed
on
its
way
for
half
a
mile
the
great
open
square
before
the
embassy
became
visible
the
embassy
was
not
that
of
a
single
planet
of
course
by
pure
necessity
every
world
was
independent
of
all
others
but
the
interstellar
diplomatic
service
represented
humanity
at
large
upon
each
individual
globe
its
ambassador
was
the
only
person
hoddan
could
even
imagine
as
listening
to
him
and
that
because
he
came
from
as
hoddan
did
but
he
mainly
counted
upon
a
in
the
embassy
during
which
to
make
more
plans
as
yet
unformed
and
unformable
he
began
though
to
see
some
virtues
in
the
simple
lawless
piratical
world
in
which
he
had
spent
his
childhood
another
police
truck
rushed
frantically
toward
him
down
a
side
street
made
little
pinging
noises
against
the
body
of
his
vehicle
he
put
on
more
speed
but
the
other
truck
overtook
him
it
ranged
alongside
its
occupants
waving
stern
commands
to
halt
and
then
just
before
it
swerved
to
force
him
off
the
highway
he
swung
instead
and
drove
it
into
a
tree
it
crashed
thunderously
one
of
his
own
wheels
collapsed
he
drove
on
with
the
crumpled
wheel
producing
an
motion
that
threatened
to
make
him
seasick
then
he
heard
yelling
behind
him
the
cops
had
piled
out
of
the
truck
and
were
in
pursuit
on
foot
the
tall
wall
of
the
embassy
was
visible
now
beyond
the
monument
to
the
first
settlers
of
walden
he
leaped
to
the
ground
and
ran
bolts
a
little
beyond
their
effective
range
stung
like
fire
they
spurred
him
on
the
gate
of
the
embassy
was
closed
he
bolted
around
the
corner
and
swarmed
up
the
conveniently
rugged
stones
of
the
wall
he
was
well
aloft
before
the
cops
spotted
him
then
they
fired
at
him
industriously
and
the
charges
crackled
all
around
him
but
he
reached
the
top
and
had
both
arms
over
the
parapet
before
a
charge
hit
his
legs
and
stunned
them
paralyzed
them
he
hung
fast
swearing
at
his
bad
luck
then
hands
grasped
his
wrists
a
man
appeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
parapet
he
took
a
good
solid
grip
and
heaved
he
drew
hoddan
over
the
top
of
the
wall
and
let
him
down
to
the
walkway
inside
it
a
near
thing
that
said
the
man
pleasantly
i
was
taking
a
walk
in
the
garden
when
i
heard
the
excitement
i
got
to
the
just
in
time
he
paused
and
added
i
do
hope
you
not
just
a
common
murderer
with
the
police
after
him
we
ca
offer
asylum
to
such
only
a
and
a
chance
to
start
running
again
but
if
you
a
political
offender
hoddan
began
to
try
to
rub
sensation
and
usefulness
back
into
his
legs
feeling
came
back
and
was
not
pleasant
i
the
interstellar
ambassador
said
the
man
politely
my
name
said
hoddan
bitterly
is
bron
hoddan
and
i
framed
for
trying
to
save
the
power
board
some
millions
of
credits
a
year
then
he
said
more
bitterly
if
you
want
to
know
i
ran
away
from
zan
to
try
to
be
a
civilized
man
and
live
a
civilized
life
it
was
a
mistake
i
to
be
permanently
jailed
for
using
my
brains
the
ambassador
cocked
his
head
thoughtfully
to
one
side
zan
he
said
the
name
hoddan
fits
to
that
somehow
oh
yes
people
say
the
people
of
zan
capture
and
loot
a
dozen
or
so
ships
a
year
only
there
no
way
to
prove
it
on
them
and
there
a
man
named
hoddan
who
supposed
to
head
a
particularly
ruffianly
gang
my
grandfather
said
hoddan
defiantly
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
outlawed
i
defied
the
planetary
government
i
disreputable
by
descent
and
worst
of
all
i
tried
to
use
my
brains
deplorable
said
the
ambassador
mildly
i
do
mean
outlawry
is
deplorable
you
understand
or
defiance
of
the
government
or
being
disreputable
but
trying
to
use
one
brains
is
bad
business
a
serious
offense
are
your
legs
all
right
now
then
come
on
down
with
me
and
have
you
given
some
dinner
and
some
fresh
clothing
and
so
on
offhand
he
added
amiably
it
would
seem
that
using
one
brains
would
be
classed
as
a
political
offense
rather
than
a
criminal
one
on
walden
we
see
hoddan
gaped
up
at
him
you
mean
there
a
possibility
that
of
course
said
the
ambassador
in
surprise
you
have
phrased
it
that
way
but
you
actually
a
rebel
a
revolutionist
you
defy
authority
and
tradition
and
governments
and
such
things
naturally
the
interstellar
diplomatic
service
is
inclined
to
be
on
your
side
what
do
you
think
it
for
ii
in
something
under
two
hours
hoddan
was
ushered
into
the
office
he
been
refreshed
his
torn
clothing
replaced
by
more
respectable
garments
and
the
places
where
had
stung
him
soothed
by
ointments
but
more
important
he
worked
out
and
firmly
adopted
a
new
point
of
view
he
been
a
misfit
at
home
on
zan
because
he
was
not
contented
with
the
humdrum
and
monotonous
life
of
a
member
of
a
community
piracy
was
a
matter
of
dangerous
in
cranky
to
be
followed
by
weeks
or
months
of
tedious
and
uncomfortable
boredom
in
highly
unhealthy
air
no
voyage
ever
contained
more
than
ten
seconds
of
satisfactory
action
and
all
took
place
just
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
a
possibly
embattled
planet
because
you
could
intercept
a
ship
at
cruising
speed
between
the
stars
regardless
of
the
result
of
the
fighting
one
had
to
get
away
fast
when
it
was
over
lest
overwhelming
force
swarm
up
from
the
nearby
world
it
was
intolerably
devoid
of
anything
an
ambitious
young
man
would
want
even
when
one
had
made
a
good
prize
with
the
lifeboats
darting
frantically
for
ground
and
after
one
got
back
to
zan
with
a
captured
ship
even
then
there
was
little
satisfaction
in
a
piratical
career
zan
had
not
a
large
population
piracy
could
support
a
large
number
of
people
zan
could
attempt
to
defend
itself
against
even
single
ships
that
sometimes
came
in
passionate
resolve
to
avenge
the
disappearance
of
a
rich
freighter
or
a
fast
new
liner
so
the
people
of
zan
to
avoid
hanging
had
to
play
innocent
they
had
to
be
convincingly
simple
harmless
folk
who
cultivated
their
fields
and
led
quiet
blameless
lives
they
might
loot
but
they
had
to
hide
their
booty
where
investigators
would
not
find
it
they
could
really
benefit
by
it
they
had
to
build
their
own
houses
and
make
their
own
garments
and
grow
their
own
food
so
life
on
zan
was
dull
piracy
was
not
profitable
in
the
sense
that
one
could
live
well
by
it
it
simply
was
a
trade
for
a
man
like
hoddan
so
he
abandoned
it
he
studied
electronics
in
books
from
looted
libraries
within
months
after
arrival
on
a
planet
he
was
able
to
earn
a
living
in
electronics
as
an
honest
trade
and
that
was
unsatisfactory
communities
were
no
more
thrilling
or
rewarding
than
piratical
ones
a
payday
now
and
then
make
up
for
the
tedium
of
labor
even
when
one
had
money
there
much
to
do
with
it
on
walden
to
be
sure
the
level
of
civilization
was
so
high
that
many
people
needed
psychiatric
treatment
to
stand
it
and
neurotics
vastly
outnumbered
more
normal
folk
and
on
walden
electronics
was
only
a
trade
like
piracy
and
no
more
fun
he
should
have
known
it
would
be
this
way
his
grandfather
had
often
discussed
this
frustration
in
human
life
us
humans
it
was
his
grandfather
habit
to
say
do
make
sense
there
some
of
us
that
work
so
hard
they
too
tired
to
enjoy
life
there
some
that
work
so
hard
at
enjoying
it
that
they
do
get
no
fun
out
of
it
and
the
rest
of
us
spend
our
lives
complainin
that
there
ai
any
fun
in
it
anyhow
the
man
that
over
all
has
the
best
time
of
any
is
one
that
picks
out
something
he
has
got
a
chance
to
do
and
spends
his
life
raisin
hell
because
he
stopped
from
doing
it
when
and
here
hoddan
grandfather
tended
to
be
emphatic
he
would
think
much
of
it
if
he
could
what
hoddan
craved
of
course
was
a
sense
of
achievement
of
doing
things
worth
doing
and
doing
them
well
technically
there
were
opportunities
all
around
him
he
developed
one
and
it
would
save
millions
of
credits
a
year
if
it
were
adopted
but
nobody
wanted
it
he
tried
to
force
its
use
he
was
in
trouble
and
now
he
could
complain
justly
enough
but
despite
his
grandfather
he
was
not
the
happiest
man
he
knew
the
ambassador
received
him
with
a
cordial
wave
of
the
hand
things
move
fast
he
said
cheerfully
you
were
here
half
an
hour
before
there
was
a
police
captain
at
the
gate
he
explained
that
an
excessively
dangerous
criminal
had
escaped
jail
and
been
seen
to
climb
the
embassy
wall
he
offered
very
generously
to
bring
some
men
in
and
capture
you
and
take
you
away
with
my
permission
of
course
he
was
shocked
when
i
declined
i
can
understand
that
said
hoddan
by
the
way
said
the
ambassador
young
men
like
yourself
is
there
a
girl
involved
in
this
hoddan
considered
a
girl
father
he
acknowledged
is
the
real
complainant
against
me
does
he
complain
asked
the
ambassador
because
you
want
to
marry
her
or
because
you
do
neither
hoddan
told
him
she
has
quite
decided
that
i
worth
defying
her
rich
father
for
good
said
the
ambassador
it
ca
be
too
bad
a
mess
while
a
woman
is
being
really
practical
i
checked
your
story
allowing
for
differences
of
viewpoint
it
agrees
with
the
official
version
ruled
that
you
are
a
political
refugee
and
so
entitled
to
sanctuary
in
the
embassy
and
that
that
thank
you
sir
said
hoddan
there
no
question
about
the
crime
observed
the
ambassador
or
that
it
is
primarily
political
you
proposed
to
improve
a
technical
process
in
a
society
which
considers
itself
beyond
improvement
if
succeeded
the
idea
of
change
would
have
spread
people
now
poor
would
have
gotten
rich
people
now
rich
would
have
gotten
poor
and
you
have
done
what
all
governments
are
established
to
prevent
so
you
never
be
able
to
walk
the
streets
of
this
planet
again
in
safety
you
scared
people
yes
sir
said
hoddan
it
been
an
unpleasant
surprise
to
them
to
be
scared
the
ambassador
put
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
do
you
realize
he
asked
that
the
whole
purpose
of
civilization
is
to
take
the
surprises
out
of
life
so
one
can
be
bored
to
death
that
a
culture
in
which
nothing
unexpected
ever
happens
is
in
what
is
called
its
golden
age
that
when
nobody
can
even
imagine
anything
happening
unexpectedly
that
they
later
fondly
refer
to
that
period
as
the
good
old
days
i
had
thought
of
it
in
just
those
words
sir
it
is
one
of
the
facts
of
life
said
the
ambassador
government
in
the
local
or
planetary
sense
of
the
word
is
an
organization
for
the
suppression
of
adventure
taxes
are
in
part
the
insurance
premiums
one
pays
for
protection
against
the
unpredictable
and
you
have
offended
against
everything
that
is
the
foundation
of
a
stable
and
orderly
and
damnably
tedious
way
of
life
against
civilization
in
fact
hoddan
frowned
yet
you
granted
me
asylum
naturally
said
the
ambassador
the
diplomatic
service
works
for
the
welfare
of
humanity
that
does
mean
stuffiness
a
golden
age
in
any
civilization
is
always
followed
by
collapse
in
ancient
days
savages
came
and
camped
outside
the
walls
of
towns
they
were
unwashed
unmannerly
and
unsanitary
people
refused
even
to
think
about
them
so
presently
the
savages
stormed
the
city
walls
and
another
civilization
went
up
in
flames
but
now
objected
hoddan
there
are
no
savages
they
invent
themselves
the
ambassador
told
him
my
point
is
that
the
diplomatic
service
cherishes
individuals
and
causes
which
battle
stuffiness
and
complacency
and
golden
ages
and
monstrous
things
like
that
not
thieves
of
course
they
degradation
like
body
lice
but
rebels
and
crackpots
and
revolutionaries
who
prevent
hardening
of
the
arteries
of
commerce
and
furnish
wholesome
exercise
to
the
body
politic
they
worth
cherishing
i
think
i
see
sir
said
hoddan
i
hope
you
do
said
the
ambassador
my
action
on
your
behalf
is
pure
diplomatic
policy
to
encourage
the
dissatisfied
is
to
insure
against
universal
satisfaction
which
is
lethal
walden
is
in
a
bad
way
you
are
the
most
encouraging
thing
that
has
happened
here
in
a
long
time
and
you
not
a
native
agreed
hoddan
i
come
from
zan
never
mind
the
ambassador
turned
to
a
stellar
atlas
consider
yourself
a
good
symptom
and
valued
as
such
if
you
could
start
a
contagion
you
deserve
well
of
your
fellow
citizens
savages
can
always
invent
themselves
but
enough
of
apology
from
me
let
us
set
about
your
affairs
he
consulted
the
atlas
where
would
you
like
to
go
since
you
must
leave
walden
not
too
far
sir
the
girl
eh
the
ambassador
did
not
smile
he
ran
his
finger
down
a
page
the
nearest
inhabited
worlds
of
course
are
krim
and
darth
krim
is
a
place
of
lively
commercial
activity
where
an
electronics
engineer
should
easily
find
employment
it
is
said
to
be
progressive
and
there
is
much
organized
research
i
would
want
to
be
a
kept
engineer
sir
said
hoddan
apologetically
i
rather
well
putter
on
my
own
impractical
but
sensible
commented
the
ambassador
he
turned
a
page
there
darth
its
social
system
is
practically
feudal
technically
backward
there
a
landing
grid
but
space
exports
are
skins
and
metal
ingots
and
practically
nothing
else
there
is
no
broadcast
power
strangers
find
the
local
customs
difficult
there
is
no
town
larger
than
twenty
thousand
people
and
few
approach
that
size
most
settled
places
are
mere
villages
near
some
feudal
castle
and
roads
are
so
few
and
bad
that
wheeled
transport
is
rare
he
leaned
back
and
said
in
a
detached
voice
i
had
a
letter
from
there
a
couple
of
months
ago
it
was
rather
arrogant
the
writer
was
one
don
loris
and
he
explained
that
his
dignity
would
not
let
him
make
a
commercial
offer
but
an
electronic
engineer
who
put
himself
under
his
protection
would
not
be
the
loser
he
signed
himself
prince
of
this
lord
of
that
baron
of
the
other
thing
and
claimant
to
the
dukedom
of
something
else
are
you
interested
no
kings
on
darth
just
feudal
chiefs
hoddan
thought
it
over
i
go
to
darth
he
decided
it
bound
to
be
better
than
zan
and
it
ca
be
worse
than
walden
the
ambassador
looked
impassive
an
embassy
servant
came
in
and
offered
an
indoor
communicator
the
ambassador
put
it
to
his
ear
after
a
moment
he
said
show
him
in
he
turned
to
hoddan
you
did
kick
up
a
storm
the
minister
of
state
no
less
is
here
to
demand
your
surrender
counter
with
a
formal
request
for
an
i
talk
to
you
again
when
he
leaves
hoddan
went
out
he
paced
up
and
down
the
other
room
into
which
he
was
shown
darth
would
be
in
a
golden
age
he
was
wiser
now
than
been
this
same
morning
he
recognized
that
he
made
mistakes
now
he
could
see
rather
ruefully
how
completely
improbable
it
was
that
anybody
could
put
across
a
technical
device
merely
by
proving
its
value
without
making
anybody
want
it
he
shook
his
head
regretfully
at
the
blunder
the
ambassador
sent
for
him
i
had
a
pleasant
time
he
told
hoddan
genially
there
was
a
beautiful
row
you
really
scared
people
hoddan
you
deserve
well
of
the
republic
every
government
and
every
person
needs
to
be
thoroughly
terrified
occasionally
it
limbers
up
the
brain
yes
sir
said
hoddan
i
the
planetary
government
said
the
ambassador
with
relish
insists
that
you
have
to
be
locked
up
with
the
key
thrown
away
because
you
know
how
to
make
deathrays
i
said
it
was
nonsense
and
you
were
a
political
refugee
in
sanctuary
the
minister
of
state
said
the
cabinet
would
consider
removing
you
forcibly
from
the
embassy
if
you
surrendered
i
said
that
if
the
embassy
was
violated
no
ship
would
clear
for
walden
from
any
other
civilized
planet
they
would
like
losing
their
trade
then
he
said
that
the
government
would
not
give
you
an
and
that
he
would
hold
me
personally
responsible
if
you
killed
everybody
on
walden
including
himself
and
me
i
said
he
insulted
me
by
suggesting
that
i
permit
such
shenanigans
he
said
the
government
would
take
an
extremely
grave
view
of
my
attitude
and
i
said
they
would
be
silly
if
they
did
then
he
went
off
with
great
dignity
but
shaking
with
panic
to
think
up
more
nonsense
illustration
evidently
said
hoddan
in
relief
you
believe
me
when
i
say
that
my
gadget
does
make
deathrays
the
ambassador
looked
slightly
embarrassed
to
be
honest
he
admitted
i
no
doubt
that
you
invented
it
independently
but
they
been
using
such
a
device
for
half
a
century
in
the
cetis
cluster
they
had
no
trouble
hoddan
winced
did
you
tell
the
minister
that
hardly
said
the
ambassador
it
would
have
done
you
no
good
in
open
revolt
and
have
performed
overt
acts
of
violence
against
the
police
but
also
it
was
impolite
enough
for
me
to
suggest
that
the
local
government
was
stupid
it
would
have
been
most
undiplomatic
to
prove
it
hoddan
did
not
feel
very
proud
just
then
i
thinking
that
the
cops
quite
unofficially
might
try
to
kidnap
me
from
the
embassy
they
deny
that
they
tried
especially
if
they
manage
it
but
i
think
they
try
very
likely
said
the
ambassador
we
take
precautions
i
like
to
make
something
not
lethal
just
in
case
said
hoddan
if
you
can
trust
me
not
to
make
deathrays
i
like
to
make
a
generator
of
microwaves
they
described
in
textbooks
they
ionize
the
air
where
they
strike
that
all
they
make
air
a
conductor
nothing
more
than
that
the
ambassador
said
there
was
an
way
to
make
ozone
when
hoddan
nodded
a
little
surprised
the
ambassador
said
by
all
means
go
ahead
you
should
be
able
to
get
parts
from
your
room
i
have
some
tools
given
you
then
he
added
diplomacy
has
to
understand
the
things
that
control
events
once
it
was
social
position
for
a
time
it
was
weapons
then
it
was
commerce
now
it
technology
but
i
wonder
how
you
use
the
ionization
of
air
to
protect
yourself
from
kidnapers
do
tell
me
i
rather
try
to
guess
he
waved
his
hand
in
cordial
dismissal
and
an
embassy
servant
showed
hoddan
to
his
quarters
ten
minutes
later
another
staff
man
brought
him
tools
such
as
would
be
needed
for
work
on
a
vision
set
he
was
left
alone
he
delicately
disassembled
the
set
in
his
room
and
began
to
put
some
of
the
parts
together
in
a
novel
but
wholly
rational
fashion
the
science
of
electronics
like
the
science
of
mathematics
had
progressed
away
beyond
the
point
where
all
of
it
had
practical
applications
one
could
spend
a
lifetime
learning
things
that
research
had
discovered
in
the
past
and
industry
had
never
found
a
use
for
on
zan
industriously
reading
pirated
books
hoddan
had
known
where
utility
stopped
kept
on
learning
long
after
a
practical
man
would
have
stopped
studying
to
get
a
paying
job
any
electronic
engineer
could
have
made
the
device
he
now
assembled
it
only
needed
to
be
wanted
and
apparently
he
was
the
first
person
to
want
it
in
this
respect
it
was
like
the
receptor
that
had
gotten
him
into
trouble
but
as
he
put
the
small
parts
together
he
felt
a
certain
loneliness
a
man
hoddan
age
needs
to
have
some
girl
admire
him
from
time
to
time
if
nedda
had
been
sitting
before
him
listening
raptly
while
he
explained
hoddan
would
probably
have
been
perfectly
happy
but
she
was
it
was
likely
she
ever
would
be
hoddan
scowled
inside
of
an
hour
he
made
a
projector
of
waves
of
eccentric
form
in
the
beam
of
that
projector
air
became
ionized
air
became
a
conductor
comparable
to
nichrome
wire
when
and
where
the
projector
sent
its
microwaves
he
was
wrapping
tape
about
the
pistol
grip
when
a
servant
brought
him
a
scribbled
note
it
had
been
handed
in
at
the
embassy
gate
by
a
woman
who
fled
after
leaving
it
it
looked
like
nedda
handwriting
it
read
like
nedda
phrasing
it
appeared
to
have
been
written
by
somebody
in
a
highly
emotional
state
but
it
was
quite
not
absolutely
convincing
he
went
to
find
the
ambassador
he
handed
over
the
note
the
ambassador
read
it
and
raised
his
eyebrows
well
it
could
be
authentic
admitted
hoddan
in
other
words
said
the
ambassador
you
are
not
sure
that
it
is
a
booby
trap
an
invitation
to
a
date
with
the
police
i
not
sure
said
hoddan
i
think
i
better
bite
if
i
have
any
illusions
left
after
this
morning
i
better
find
it
out
i
thought
nedda
liked
me
quite
a
lot
i
make
no
comment
observed
the
ambassador
can
i
help
you
in
any
way
i
have
to
leave
the
embassy
said
hoddan
and
there
a
practically
solid
line
of
police
outside
the
walls
could
i
borrow
some
old
clothes
a
few
pillows
and
a
length
of
rope
half
an
hour
later
a
rope
uncoiled
itself
at
the
very
darkest
outside
corner
of
the
embassy
wall
it
dangled
down
to
the
ground
this
was
at
the
rear
of
the
embassy
enclosure
the
night
was
bright
with
stars
and
the
city
towers
glittered
with
many
lights
but
here
there
was
almost
complete
blackness
and
that
silence
of
a
city
which
is
sometimes
so
companionable
the
rope
remained
hanging
from
the
wall
no
light
reached
the
ground
there
the
tiny
crescent
of
walden
farthest
moon
cast
an
insufficient
glow
nothing
could
be
seen
by
it
the
rope
went
up
as
if
it
had
been
lowered
merely
to
make
sure
that
it
was
long
enough
for
its
purpose
then
it
descended
again
this
time
a
figure
dangled
at
its
end
it
came
down
swaying
a
little
it
reached
the
blackest
part
of
the
shadow
at
the
wall
base
it
stayed
there
nothing
happened
the
figure
rose
swiftly
hauled
up
in
rapid
pullings
of
the
rope
then
the
line
came
down
again
and
again
a
figure
descended
but
this
figure
moved
the
rope
swayed
and
oscillated
the
figure
came
down
a
good
halfway
to
the
ground
it
paused
and
then
descended
with
much
movement
to
of
the
way
from
the
top
there
something
seemed
to
alarm
it
it
began
to
rise
with
violent
writhings
of
the
rope
it
climbed
there
was
a
crackling
noise
a
the
figure
seemed
to
climb
more
frantically
more
cracklings
half
a
dozen
a
dozen
sharp
snapping
noises
they
were
charges
and
there
were
tiny
sparks
where
they
hit
the
dangling
figure
seemed
convulsed
it
went
limp
but
it
did
not
fall
more
charges
poured
into
it
it
hung
motionless
halfway
up
the
wall
of
the
embassy
movements
began
in
the
darkness
men
appeared
talking
in
low
tones
and
straining
their
eyes
toward
the
now
motionless
figure
they
gathered
underneath
it
one
went
off
at
a
run
carrying
a
message
someone
of
authority
arrived
panting
there
was
more
argument
more
and
still
more
men
appeared
there
were
forty
or
fifty
figures
at
the
base
of
the
wall
one
of
those
figures
began
to
climb
the
rope
hand
over
hand
he
reached
the
motionless
object
he
swore
in
a
shocked
voice
he
was
shushed
from
below
he
let
the
figure
drop
it
made
next
to
no
sound
when
it
landed
then
there
was
a
rushing
as
the
guards
about
the
embassy
went
furiously
back
to
their
proper
posts
to
keep
anybody
from
slipping
out
two
men
remained
swearing
bitterly
over
a
dummy
made
of
old
clothes
and
pillows
but
their
profanity
was
in
vain
hoddan
was
then
some
blocks
away
he
suffered
painful
doubt
about
the
note
ostensibly
from
nedda
the
guards
about
the
embassy
would
have
tried
to
catch
him
in
any
case
but
it
did
seem
very
plausible
that
the
note
had
been
sent
him
to
get
him
to
try
to
get
down
the
wall
on
the
other
hand
a
false
descent
of
a
palpably
dummylike
dummy
had
been
plausible
too
he
drawn
all
the
guards
to
one
spot
by
his
seeming
doubt
and
by
testing
out
their
vigilance
with
a
dummy
the
only
thing
improbable
in
his
behavior
had
been
that
after
testing
their
vigilance
with
a
dummy
he
made
use
of
it
a
fair
distance
away
he
turned
sedately
into
a
narrow
lane
between
buildings
this
paralleled
another
lane
serving
the
home
of
a
girl
friend
of
nedda
the
note
had
named
the
garden
behind
that
other
girl
home
as
a
rendezvous
but
hoddan
was
not
going
to
that
garden
he
wanted
to
make
sure
if
the
cops
had
forged
the
note
he
judged
his
position
carefully
if
he
climbed
this
tree
kind
of
the
of
walden
to
use
trees
so
lavishly
if
he
climbed
this
tree
he
could
look
into
the
garden
where
nedda
in
theory
waited
in
tears
he
climbed
it
he
sat
astride
a
thick
limb
in
scented
darkness
and
considered
further
presently
he
brought
out
his
projector
there
was
deepest
darkness
hereabouts
trees
and
shrubbery
were
merely
blacker
than
their
surroundings
but
there
was
reason
for
suspicion
neither
in
the
house
of
nedda
girl
friend
nor
in
the
nearer
house
between
was
there
a
single
lighted
window
hoddan
adjusted
the
and
pressed
the
stud
of
his
instrument
he
pointed
it
carefully
into
the
nearer
garden
a
man
grunted
in
a
surprised
tone
there
was
a
stirring
a
man
swore
startledly
the
words
seemed
inappropriate
to
a
citizen
merely
breathing
the
evening
air
hoddan
frowned
the
note
from
nedda
seemed
to
have
been
a
forgery
to
make
sure
he
readjusted
the
to
project
a
thin
but
beam
he
aimed
again
painstakingly
he
traversed
the
area
in
which
men
would
have
been
posted
to
jump
him
in
the
event
that
the
note
was
forged
if
nedda
were
there
she
would
feel
no
effect
if
police
lay
in
wait
they
would
notice
at
once
they
did
a
man
howled
two
men
yelled
together
somebody
bellowed
somebody
squealed
someone
in
charge
of
the
flares
made
ready
to
give
light
for
the
police
was
so
startled
by
a
strange
sensation
that
he
jerked
the
cord
an
immense
brilliance
appeared
the
garden
where
nedda
definitely
was
not
present
became
bathed
in
incandescence
light
spilled
over
the
wall
of
one
garden
into
the
next
and
disclosed
a
squirming
mass
of
police
in
the
nearer
garden
also
some
of
them
leaped
wildly
and
ungracefully
while
clawing
behind
them
some
stood
still
and
struggled
desperately
to
accomplish
something
to
their
rear
while
others
gazed
blankly
at
them
until
hoddan
swung
his
instrument
their
way
also
a
man
tore
off
his
pants
and
swarmed
over
the
wall
to
get
away
from
something
intolerable
others
imitated
him
save
in
the
direction
of
their
flight
some
removed
their
trousers
before
they
fled
but
others
tried
to
get
them
off
while
fleeing
those
last
did
not
fare
too
well
mostly
they
stumbled
and
other
men
fell
over
them
when
both
fallen
and
uttered
hoarse
and
profane
lamentations
they
howled
to
the
high
heavens
hoddan
let
the
confusion
mount
past
any
unscrambling
and
then
slid
down
the
tree
and
joined
in
the
rush
with
the
glare
in
the
air
behind
him
he
only
feigned
to
stumble
over
one
figure
after
another
once
he
grunted
as
he
scorched
his
own
fingers
but
he
came
out
of
the
lane
with
a
dozen
mostly
uncomfortably
warm
as
trophies
of
the
ambush
as
they
cooled
off
he
stowed
them
away
in
his
belt
and
pockets
strolling
away
down
the
street
behind
him
cops
realized
their
trouserless
condition
and
appealed
plaintively
to
householders
to
notify
headquarters
of
their
state
hoddan
did
not
feel
particularly
disillusioned
somehow
it
occurred
to
him
even
that
this
particular
event
was
likely
to
help
him
get
off
of
walden
if
he
was
to
leave
against
the
cops
will
he
needed
to
have
them
at
less
than
top
efficiency
and
men
who
have
had
their
pants
scorched
off
them
are
not
apt
to
think
too
clearly
hoddan
felt
a
certain
confidence
increase
in
his
mind
he
worked
the
thing
out
very
nicely
if
ionization
made
air
a
conductor
then
an
ionizing
beam
would
make
a
short
between
the
power
terminals
of
a
with
the
power
a
carried
that
short
would
get
hot
so
would
the
pistol
it
would
get
hot
enough
in
fact
to
scorch
cloth
in
contact
with
it
which
had
happened
if
the
effect
had
been
produced
in
the
soles
of
policemen
feet
hoddan
would
have
given
every
cop
a
hotfoot
but
since
they
carried
their
in
their
the
thought
of
nedda
diminished
his
satisfaction
the
note
could
be
pure
forgery
or
the
police
could
have
learned
about
it
through
the
treachery
of
the
servant
she
sent
to
the
embassy
with
it
it
would
be
worthwhile
to
know
he
headed
toward
the
home
of
her
father
if
she
were
loyal
to
him
why
it
would
complicate
things
considerably
but
he
felt
it
necessary
to
find
out
he
neared
the
spot
where
nedda
lived
this
was
an
especially
desirable
residential
area
the
houses
were
large
and
gracefully
designed
and
the
gardens
were
especially
lush
presently
he
heard
music
ahead
live
music
he
went
on
he
came
to
a
place
where
strolling
citizens
had
paused
under
the
trees
of
the
street
to
listen
to
the
melody
and
the
sound
of
voices
that
accompanied
it
and
the
music
and
the
festivity
was
in
the
house
in
which
nedda
dwelt
she
was
having
a
party
on
the
very
night
of
the
day
in
which
he
been
framed
for
life
imprisonment
it
was
a
shock
then
there
was
a
rush
of
vehicles
and
police
trucks
were
disgorging
cops
before
the
door
they
formed
a
cordon
about
the
house
and
some
knocked
and
were
admitted
in
haste
then
hoddan
nodded
dourly
to
himself
his
escape
from
the
embassy
was
now
known
no
less
certainly
the
failure
of
the
trap
nedda
note
had
baited
had
been
reported
the
police
were
now
turning
the
whole
city
into
a
trap
for
one
bron
hoddan
and
they
were
looking
first
at
the
most
probable
places
then
search
the
possible
places
for
him
to
be
and
by
the
time
that
had
been
accomplished
they
have
cops
from
other
cities
pouring
into
the
city
and
they
search
every
square
inch
of
it
for
him
and
certainly
and
positively
they
take
the
most
urgent
and
infallible
precautions
to
make
sure
he
did
get
back
into
the
embassy
it
was
a
situation
that
would
have
appalled
hoddan
only
that
morning
now
though
he
only
shook
his
head
sadly
he
moved
on
he
gotten
into
trouble
by
trying
to
make
an
industrial
civilization
accept
something
it
did
want
a
technical
improvement
in
a
standard
electronic
device
he
gotten
partly
out
of
trouble
by
giving
his
jailers
what
they
definitely
desired
the
sight
of
him
apparently
a
suicide
in
the
cell
in
the
detention
building
he
come
out
of
the
embassy
again
by
giving
the
watchers
outside
a
view
they
urgently
desired
a
figure
secretly
descending
the
embassy
wall
he
indulged
himself
at
the
ambuscade
but
the
way
to
get
back
into
the
embassy
it
was
not
far
from
nedda
house
to
a
kiosk
decoratively
placed
on
a
street
corner
he
entered
it
it
was
unattended
of
course
it
was
simply
an
installation
where
cops
could
be
summoned
or
fires
reported
or
emergencies
described
by
citizens
independently
of
the
regular
home
communicators
it
had
occurred
to
hoddan
that
the
planetary
authorities
would
be
greatly
pleased
to
hear
of
a
situation
in
a
place
that
would
seem
to
hint
at
his
presence
there
were
all
sorts
of
public
services
that
would
be
delighted
to
operate
impressively
in
their
own
lines
there
were
bureaus
which
would
rejoice
in
a
chance
to
show
off
their
efficiency
he
used
his
microwave
generator
which
at
short
enough
range
would
anything
upon
the
apparatus
in
the
kiosk
it
was
perfectly
simple
if
one
knew
how
he
worked
with
a
sort
of
tender
thoroughness
shorting
this
item
shorting
that
giving
this
frantic
emergency
call
stating
that
baseless
lie
when
he
went
out
of
the
kiosk
he
walked
briskly
toward
an
appointment
he
had
made
and
presently
the
murmur
of
the
city
at
night
had
new
sounds
added
to
it
they
began
as
a
faint
confused
clamor
at
the
edges
of
the
city
the
uproar
moved
centralward
and
grew
louder
as
it
came
there
were
clanging
bells
and
sirens
and
warning
all
nonofficial
vehicles
to
keep
out
of
the
way
on
the
expressway
snorting
metal
monsters
rushed
with
squealing
excitement
on
the
fragrant
lesser
streets
small
vehicles
rushed
with
proportionately
louder
howlings
police
trucks
poured
out
of
their
cubbyholes
and
plunged
valiantly
through
the
dark
signaled
emergency
and
cut
off
the
air
to
make
the
placid
ether
waves
available
to
authority
all
these
noises
and
all
this
tumult
moved
toward
a
single
point
the
outer
parts
of
the
city
regained
their
former
quiet
save
that
there
was
less
music
the
broadcasts
were
off
but
the
sound
of
racing
vehicles
clamoring
for
grew
louder
and
louder
and
more
and
more
peremptory
as
it
concentrated
toward
the
large
open
square
on
which
the
interstellar
embassy
faced
from
every
street
and
avenue
equipment
poured
into
that
square
in
between
and
behind
hooting
loudly
for
precedence
police
trucks
accompanied
and
them
emergency
vehicles
of
all
the
civic
bureaus
appeared
all
of
them
with
immense
conviction
of
their
importance
it
was
a
very
large
open
square
that
space
before
the
embassy
from
its
edge
the
monument
to
the
first
settlers
in
the
center
looked
small
but
even
that
vast
plaza
filled
up
with
trucks
of
every
imaginable
variety
from
the
hose
towers
which
could
throw
streams
of
water
four
hundred
feet
straight
up
to
the
miniature
of
electricity
supply
staff
cars
of
fire
and
police
and
sanitary
services
crowded
each
other
and
bumped
fenders
with
trucks
prepared
to
move
fallen
trees
and
with
trucks
ready
to
lend
stentorian
tones
to
any
voice
of
authority
but
there
was
no
situation
except
that
there
was
no
situation
there
was
no
fire
there
was
no
riot
there
were
not
even
stray
dogs
for
the
pound
wagons
to
pursue
nor
broken
water
mains
for
the
water
department
technicians
to
shut
off
and
repair
there
was
nothing
for
anybody
to
do
but
ask
everybody
else
what
the
hell
they
were
doing
there
and
presently
to
swear
at
each
other
for
cluttering
up
the
way
the
din
of
arriving
horns
and
sirens
had
stopped
and
a
mutter
of
profanity
was
developing
when
a
last
vehicle
arrived
it
was
an
ambulance
and
it
came
purposefully
out
of
a
side
avenue
and
swung
toward
a
particular
place
as
if
it
knew
exactly
what
it
was
about
when
its
way
was
blocked
it
hooted
impatiently
for
passage
its
lights
blinked
violently
red
demanding
clearance
a
giant
unit
pulled
aside
the
ambulance
ran
past
and
hooted
at
a
cluster
of
police
trucks
they
made
way
for
it
it
blared
at
a
gathering
of
dismounted
irritated
truck
personnel
it
made
its
way
through
them
it
moved
in
a
straight
line
for
the
gate
of
the
interstellar
embassy
a
hundred
yards
from
that
gate
its
horn
blatted
irritably
at
the
car
of
the
acting
head
of
municipal
police
that
car
obediently
made
way
for
it
the
ambulance
rolled
briskly
up
to
the
very
gate
of
the
embassy
there
it
stopped
a
figure
got
down
from
the
driver
seat
and
walked
purposefully
in
the
gate
thereafter
nothing
happened
at
all
until
a
second
figure
rolled
and
toppled
itself
out
on
the
ground
from
the
seat
beside
the
ambulance
driver
that
figure
kicked
and
writhed
on
the
ground
a
policeman
went
to
find
out
what
was
the
matter
it
was
the
ambulance
driver
not
the
one
who
driven
the
ambulance
to
the
embassy
gate
but
the
one
who
should
have
he
was
bound
hand
and
foot
and
not
too
tightly
gagged
when
released
he
swore
vividly
while
panting
that
he
had
been
captured
and
bound
by
somebody
who
said
he
was
bron
hoddan
and
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
the
interstellar
embassy
there
was
no
uproar
those
to
whom
hoddan
name
had
meaning
were
struck
speechless
with
rage
the
fury
of
the
police
was
even
too
deep
for
tears
but
bron
hoddan
back
in
the
quarters
assigned
him
in
the
embassy
unloaded
a
dozen
from
his
pockets
and
sent
word
to
the
ambassador
that
he
was
back
and
that
the
note
ostensibly
from
nedda
had
actually
been
a
police
trap
getting
ready
to
retire
he
reviewed
his
situation
in
some
respects
it
was
not
too
bad
all
but
nedda
share
in
trying
to
trap
him
and
having
a
party
the
same
night
he
stared
morosely
at
the
wall
then
he
saw
very
simply
that
she
might
have
known
even
of
his
arrest
she
lived
a
highly
sheltered
life
her
father
could
have
had
her
kept
completely
in
ignorance
he
cheered
immediately
this
would
be
his
last
night
on
walden
if
he
were
lucky
but
vague
plans
already
revolved
in
his
mind
yes
achieve
splendid
things
he
grow
rich
he
come
back
and
marry
that
delightful
girl
nedda
and
end
as
a
great
man
already
today
done
a
number
of
things
worth
doing
and
on
the
whole
he
done
them
well
iii
when
dawn
broke
over
the
capital
city
of
walden
the
sight
was
appropriately
glamorous
there
were
shining
towers
and
curving
ways
above
which
innumerable
small
birds
flew
tumultuously
the
dawn
in
fact
was
heralded
by
chirpings
everywhere
during
the
darkness
there
had
been
a
humming
sound
audible
all
over
the
city
that
was
the
landing
grid
in
operation
out
at
the
spaceport
letting
down
a
liner
from
rigel
cetis
and
the
nearer
rim
presently
it
would
take
off
for
krim
darth
and
the
coalsack
stars
and
if
hoddan
was
lucky
he
would
be
on
it
but
at
the
earliest
part
of
the
day
there
was
only
tranquillity
over
the
city
and
the
square
and
the
interstellar
embassy
at
the
gate
of
the
embassy
enclosure
staff
members
piled
up
boxes
and
bales
and
parcels
for
transport
to
the
spaceport
and
thence
to
destinations
whose
names
were
practically
songs
there
were
dispatches
to
delil
where
the
interstellar
diplomatic
service
had
a
sector
headquarters
and
there
were
packets
of
invoices
for
lohala
and
tralee
and
famagusta
there
were
boxes
for
sind
and
maja
and
cases
for
kent
the
early
explorers
of
this
part
of
the
galaxy
had
christened
huge
suns
for
little
villages
and
territories
back
on
earth
which
less
than
one
human
being
in
ten
thousand
had
ever
seen
the
sound
of
the
stacking
of
freight
parcels
was
crisp
and
distinct
in
the
morning
hush
the
dew
deposited
during
darkness
had
not
yet
dried
from
the
pavement
of
the
square
damp
unhappy
figures
loafed
nearby
they
were
secret
police
as
yet
unrelieved
after
a
night
vigil
about
the
embassy
rugged
wall
they
were
sleepy
and
their
clothing
stuck
soggily
to
them
and
none
of
them
had
had
anything
warm
in
his
stomach
for
many
hours
they
had
not
either
anything
to
look
forward
to
from
their
superiors
hoddan
was
again
in
sanctuary
inside
the
embassy
they
guarded
so
ineptly
through
the
dark
he
gotten
out
without
their
leave
and
made
a
number
of
their
fellows
unwilling
to
sit
down
and
then
made
all
the
police
and
municipal
authorities
ridiculous
by
the
manner
of
his
return
the
police
guards
about
the
embassy
were
very
positively
not
in
a
cheery
mood
but
one
of
them
saw
an
embassy
servant
he
knew
he
stood
the
man
drinks
in
times
past
to
establish
a
contact
that
might
be
useful
he
summoned
a
smile
and
beckoned
to
that
man
the
embassy
servant
came
briskly
to
him
rubbing
his
hands
after
having
put
a
moderately
heavy
case
of
documents
on
top
of
the
waiting
pile
that
hoddan
said
the
plainclothesman
attempting
hearty
ruefulness
he
certainly
put
it
over
on
us
last
night
the
servant
nodded
look
said
the
plainclothesman
there
could
be
something
in
it
for
you
if
you
wanted
to
make
a
little
extra
money
the
servant
looked
regretful
no
chance
he
said
he
leaving
today
the
plainclothesman
jumped
today
for
darth
said
the
embassy
servant
the
ambassador
shipping
him
off
on
the
space
liner
that
came
in
last
night
the
plainclothesman
dithered
how
he
going
to
get
to
the
spaceport
i
would
know
said
the
servant
they
figured
out
some
way
i
could
use
a
little
extra
money
too
he
lingered
but
the
plainclothesman
was
staring
at
the
innocent
inviolable
parcels
about
to
leave
the
embassy
for
distant
parts
he
took
note
of
sizes
and
descriptions
no
not
yet
but
if
hoddan
was
leaving
he
had
to
leave
the
embassy
if
he
left
the
embassy
the
plainclothesman
bolted
he
made
a
breathless
report
by
the
portable
communicator
set
up
for
just
such
use
he
told
what
the
embassy
servant
had
said
and
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
it
the
suspicions
to
be
entertained
and
there
he
stopped
short
orders
came
back
to
him
orders
were
given
in
all
directions
somebody
was
going
to
distinguish
himself
by
catching
hoddan
and
undercover
politics
worked
to
decide
who
it
should
be
even
the
job
of
guard
outside
the
embassy
became
desirable
so
fresh
alert
plainclothesmen
arrived
they
were
and
and
they
took
over
weary
hungry
men
yielded
up
their
posts
they
went
home
the
man
who
gotten
the
infallibly
certain
clue
went
home
too
disgruntled
because
he
was
allowed
a
share
in
the
credit
for
hoddan
capture
but
he
was
glad
of
it
later
inside
the
embassy
hoddan
finished
his
breakfast
with
the
ambassador
i
giving
you
said
the
ambassador
that
letter
to
the
character
on
darth
i
told
you
about
him
he
some
sort
of
nobleman
and
has
need
of
an
electronic
engineer
on
darth
they
rare
to
nonexistent
but
his
letter
was
too
specific
i
remember
agreed
hoddan
i
look
him
up
thanks
somehow
said
the
ambassador
i
cherish
unreasonable
hopes
of
you
hoddan
a
psychologist
would
say
that
your
group
identification
is
low
and
your
cyclothymia
practically
a
minus
quantity
while
your
ergic
tension
is
pleasingly
high
he
mean
that
with
reasonable
good
fortune
you
will
raise
more
hell
than
most
i
wish
you
that
good
fortune
and
hoddan
yes
i
do
urge
you
to
be
vengeful
explained
the
ambassador
but
i
do
hope
you
wo
be
too
forgiving
of
these
characters
who
have
jailed
you
for
life
you
scared
them
badly
it
very
good
for
them
anything
more
you
can
do
in
that
line
will
be
really
a
kindness
and
as
such
will
positively
not
be
appreciated
but
it
be
well
worth
doing
i
say
this
because
i
like
the
way
you
plan
things
and
any
time
i
can
be
of
service
thanks
said
hoddan
but
i
better
get
going
for
the
spaceport
he
write
nedda
from
darth
i
get
set
for
it
he
rose
the
ambassador
stood
up
too
i
like
the
way
you
plan
things
he
repeated
appreciatively
check
over
that
box
they
left
the
embassy
dining
room
together
it
was
well
after
sunrise
when
hoddan
finished
his
breakfast
and
the
bright
and
watchful
new
plainclothesmen
were
very
much
on
the
alert
outside
by
this
time
the
sunshine
had
lost
its
early
ruddy
tint
and
the
trees
about
the
city
were
vividly
green
and
the
sky
had
become
appropriately
blue
as
the
skies
on
all
planets
are
there
was
the
beginning
of
traffic
some
was
routine
movement
of
goods
and
vehicles
but
some
was
special
for
example
the
trucks
which
came
to
carry
the
embassy
shipment
to
the
spaceport
they
were
perfectly
ordinary
trucks
hired
in
a
perfectly
ordinary
way
by
the
ambassador
secretary
they
came
trundling
across
the
square
and
into
the
embassy
gate
the
ostentatiously
loafing
plainclothesmen
could
look
in
and
see
the
waiting
parcels
loaded
on
them
the
first
truckload
was
quite
unsuspicious
there
was
no
package
in
the
lot
which
could
have
held
a
man
in
even
the
most
impossibly
cramped
of
positions
but
the
police
took
no
chances
ten
blocks
from
the
embassy
the
cops
stopped
it
and
verified
the
licenses
and
identities
of
the
driver
and
his
helper
this
was
a
moderately
lengthy
business
while
it
went
on
plainclothesmen
worked
over
the
packages
in
the
truck
body
and
put
stethoscopes
to
any
of
more
than
one
cubic
foot
capacity
they
waved
the
truck
on
meanwhile
the
second
truck
was
loading
up
and
the
watching
ostensible
loafers
saw
that
nearly
the
last
item
to
be
put
on
it
was
a
large
box
which
had
been
visible
before
it
was
carried
with
some
care
and
it
was
marked
fragile
and
it
was
put
into
place
and
wedged
fast
with
other
parcels
the
plainclothesmen
looked
at
each
other
with
anticipatory
glee
one
of
them
reported
the
last
large
box
with
almost
lyric
enthusiasm
when
the
second
truck
left
the
embassy
with
the
large
box
a
police
truck
came
innocently
out
of
nowhere
and
just
happened
to
be
going
the
same
way
ten
blocks
away
again
the
truck
load
of
embassy
parcels
was
flagged
down
and
its
driver
license
and
identity
was
verified
a
plainclothesman
put
a
stethoscope
on
the
questionable
case
he
beamed
and
made
a
suitable
signal
the
truck
went
on
while
zestful
machiavelian
plans
took
effect
five
blocks
farther
an
unmarked
empty
truck
came
hurtling
out
of
a
side
street
sideswiped
the
truck
from
the
embassy
and
went
careening
away
down
the
street
without
stopping
the
trailing
police
truck
made
no
attempt
at
pursuit
instead
it
stopped
helpfully
by
the
truck
which
had
been
hit
a
wheel
was
hopelessly
gone
so
uniformed
police
with
conspicuously
happy
expressions
cleared
a
space
around
the
stalled
truck
and
stood
guard
over
the
parcels
under
diplomatic
seal
with
eager
helpfulness
they
sent
for
other
transportation
for
the
shipment
a
sneeze
was
heard
from
within
the
mass
of
guarded
freight
and
the
policemen
shook
hands
with
each
other
when
substitute
trucks
came
there
were
two
of
them
they
loaded
one
high
with
embassy
parcels
and
sent
it
off
to
the
spaceport
with
their
blessing
there
remained
just
one
single
box
to
be
put
on
the
second
vehicle
they
bumped
it
on
the
ground
and
a
startled
grunt
came
from
within
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
innocent
enjoyment
all
about
as
the
police
tenderly
loaded
this
large
box
on
the
second
truck
they
sent
for
and
festooned
themselves
about
it
as
it
trundled
away
strangely
it
did
not
head
directly
for
the
spaceport
the
police
carefully
explained
this
to
each
other
in
loud
voices
then
some
of
them
were
afraid
the
box
heard
so
they
knocked
on
it
the
box
coughed
and
it
seemed
hilariously
amusing
to
the
policemen
that
the
contents
of
a
freight
parcel
should
cough
they
expressed
deep
concern
and
addressing
the
box
explained
that
they
were
taking
it
to
the
detention
building
where
they
would
give
it
some
cough
medicine
the
box
swore
at
them
despairingly
they
howled
with
childish
laughter
and
assured
the
box
that
after
they
had
opened
it
and
given
it
cough
medicine
they
would
close
it
again
very
carefully
leaving
the
diplomatic
seal
unbroken
and
deliver
it
to
the
spaceport
so
it
could
go
on
its
way
the
box
swore
again
luridly
the
truck
which
carried
it
hastened
the
box
teetered
and
bumped
and
jounced
with
the
swift
motion
of
the
vehicle
that
carried
it
and
all
the
police
around
it
bitter
enraged
and
highly
unprintable
language
came
from
within
the
police
were
charmed
even
so
early
in
the
morning
they
seemed
inclined
to
burst
into
song
when
the
detention
building
gate
opened
for
it
and
closed
again
behind
it
there
was
a
welcoming
committee
in
the
courtyard
it
included
a
jailer
with
a
bandaged
head
and
a
look
of
vengeful
satisfaction
on
his
face
and
no
less
than
three
guards
who
had
been
given
baths
by
a
hose
when
bron
hoddan
departed
from
his
cell
they
wore
unamiable
expressions
and
then
while
the
box
swore
very
bitterly
somebody
tenderly
loosened
a
plank
being
careful
not
to
disturb
the
diplomatic
seal
and
pulled
it
away
with
a
triumphant
gesture
then
all
the
police
could
look
into
the
box
and
they
did
then
there
was
dead
silence
except
for
the
voice
that
came
from
a
communicator
set
inside
said
the
voice
from
the
box
and
only
now
did
anybody
notice
what
the
muffling
effect
of
the
boards
had
hidden
that
it
was
a
which
had
sworn
and
coughed
and
sneezed
take
our
leave
of
the
planet
walden
and
its
happy
police
force
who
wave
to
us
as
our
lifts
toward
the
skies
the
next
sound
you
hear
will
be
that
of
their
lamentations
at
our
but
the
next
sound
was
a
howl
of
fury
the
police
were
very
much
disappointed
to
learn
that
hoddan
had
been
in
the
box
but
only
of
a
communication
pair
and
that
hoddan
had
coughed
and
sneezed
and
sworn
at
them
from
the
other
instrument
somewhere
else
now
he
signed
off
the
space
liner
was
not
lifting
off
just
yet
it
was
still
solidly
aground
in
the
center
of
the
landing
grid
hoddan
had
bade
farewell
to
his
audience
from
the
floor
of
the
ambassador
which
at
that
moment
was
safely
within
the
circle
about
the
spaceship
he
turned
off
the
set
and
got
up
and
brushed
himself
off
he
got
out
of
the
car
the
ambassador
followed
him
and
shook
his
hand
you
have
a
touch
said
the
ambassador
sedately
you
seem
inspired
at
times
hoddan
you
have
a
gift
for
infuriating
constituted
authority
you
should
plot
at
your
art
you
may
go
far
he
shook
hands
again
and
watched
hoddan
walk
into
the
lift
which
should
raise
him
and
did
raise
him
to
the
entrance
port
of
the
space
liner
twenty
minutes
later
the
force
fields
of
the
giant
landing
grid
lifted
the
liner
smoothly
out
to
space
the
vessel
went
out
to
five
planetary
diameters
where
its
lawlor
drive
could
take
hold
of
relatively
unstressed
space
there
the
ship
jockeyed
for
line
and
then
there
was
that
curious
momentary
disturbance
of
all
sensations
which
was
the
effect
of
the
overdrive
field
going
on
then
everything
was
normal
again
except
that
the
liner
was
speeding
for
the
planet
krim
at
something
more
than
thirty
times
the
speed
of
light
normality
extended
through
all
the
galaxy
so
far
inhabited
by
men
there
were
worlds
on
which
there
was
peace
and
worlds
on
which
there
was
tumult
there
were
busy
zestful
young
worlds
and
languid
weary
old
ones
from
the
near
rim
to
the
farthest
of
occupied
systems
planets
circled
their
suns
and
men
lived
on
them
and
every
man
took
himself
seriously
and
did
not
quite
believe
that
the
universe
had
existed
before
he
was
born
or
would
long
survive
his
loss
time
passed
comets
let
out
vast
streamers
like
bridal
veils
and
swept
toward
and
around
their
suns
some
of
them
one
in
ten
thousand
or
twenty
were
possibly
seen
by
human
eyes
the
liner
bearing
hoddan
sped
through
the
void
in
time
it
made
a
landfall
on
the
planet
krim
he
went
aground
and
observed
the
spaceport
city
it
was
new
and
bustling
with
tall
buildings
and
traffic
jams
and
a
feverish
conviction
that
the
purpose
of
living
was
to
earn
more
money
this
year
than
last
its
spaceport
was
chaotically
busy
hoddan
had
time
for
swift
sightseeing
of
one
city
only
and
an
estimate
of
what
the
people
of
such
a
planet
would
be
sure
they
wanted
he
saw
slums
and
gracious
public
buildings
and
went
back
to
the
spaceport
and
the
liner
which
then
rose
upon
the
landing
grid
force
fields
until
krim
was
a
great
round
ball
below
it
then
there
was
again
a
jockeying
for
line
and
the
liner
winked
out
of
sight
and
was
again
journeying
at
thirty
times
the
speed
of
light
again
time
passed
in
one
of
the
remoter
galaxies
a
flamed
and
on
a
rocky
barren
world
a
small
living
thing
squirmed
experimentally
and
to
mankind
the
one
event
was
just
as
important
as
the
other
but
presently
the
liner
from
krim
and
walden
appeared
in
darth
as
the
tiniest
of
shimmering
pearly
specks
against
the
blue
to
the
north
and
east
and
west
of
the
spaceport
rugged
mountains
rose
steeply
patches
of
snow
showed
here
and
there
and
naked
rock
reared
boldly
in
spurs
and
precipices
but
there
were
trees
on
all
the
lower
slopes
and
there
was
not
really
a
timberline
the
space
liner
increased
in
size
descending
toward
the
landing
grid
the
grid
itself
was
a
monstrous
lattice
of
steel
half
a
mile
high
and
enclosing
a
circle
not
less
in
diameter
it
filled
much
the
larger
part
of
the
level
valley
floor
and
horned
and
what
hoddan
later
learned
were
horses
grazed
in
it
the
animals
paid
no
attention
to
the
humming
noise
the
grid
made
in
its
operation
the
ship
seemed
the
size
of
a
pea
presently
it
was
the
size
of
an
apple
then
it
was
the
size
of
a
basketball
and
then
it
swelled
enormously
and
put
out
spidery
metal
legs
with
large
splay
metal
feet
on
them
and
alighted
and
settled
gently
to
the
ground
the
humming
stopped
there
were
shoutings
whips
cracked
straining
heaved
and
dragged
something
very
deliberately
out
from
between
warehouses
under
the
arches
of
the
grid
there
were
two
dozen
of
the
and
despite
the
shouts
and
they
moved
with
a
stubborn
slowness
it
took
a
long
time
for
the
object
with
the
wheels
to
reach
a
spot
below
the
spacecraft
then
it
took
longer
seemingly
for
brakes
to
be
set
on
each
wheel
and
then
for
the
draught
animals
to
be
arranged
to
pull
as
two
teams
against
each
other
more
shoutings
and
a
long
slanting
ladderlike
arm
arose
it
teetered
and
a
man
with
a
lurid
purple
cloak
rose
with
it
at
its
very
end
the
ship
air
lock
opened
and
a
crewman
threw
a
rope
the
man
caught
it
and
made
it
fast
from
somewhere
inside
the
ship
of
space
the
line
was
hauled
in
the
end
of
the
landing
ramp
touched
the
sill
of
the
air
lock
somebody
made
other
things
fast
and
the
man
triumphantly
entered
the
ship
there
was
a
pause
men
loaded
carts
with
cargo
to
be
sent
to
remote
and
unimagined
planets
in
the
air
lock
bron
hoddan
stepped
to
the
unloading
ramp
and
descended
to
the
ground
he
was
the
only
passenger
he
had
barely
reached
a
firm
footing
when
objects
followed
him
his
own
ship
bag
a
gift
from
the
ambassador
and
then
parcels
bales
boxes
and
such
nondescript
items
of
freight
as
needed
special
designation
rolls
of
wire
long
strings
of
plastic
objects
strung
like
beads
on
shipping
cords
plexiskins
of
fluid
which
might
be
anything
from
wine
to
fuel
oil
in
less
than
quantities
for
a
mere
five
minutes
the
flow
of
freight
continued
darth
was
not
an
important
center
of
trade
hoddan
stared
incredulously
at
the
town
outside
one
side
of
the
grid
it
was
only
a
town
and
was
almost
a
village
at
that
its
houses
had
steep
gabled
roofs
of
which
some
seemed
to
be
tile
and
others
thatch
its
buildings
leaned
over
the
narrow
streets
which
were
unpaved
they
looked
like
mud
and
there
was
not
a
ground
vehicle
anywhere
in
sight
nor
anything
man
made
in
the
air
great
carts
trailed
out
to
the
unloading
belt
they
dumped
bales
of
skins
and
ingots
of
metal
and
more
bales
and
more
ingots
those
objects
rode
up
to
the
air
lock
and
vanished
hoddan
was
ignored
he
felt
that
without
great
care
he
might
be
crowded
back
into
the
reversed
loading
belt
and
be
carried
back
into
the
ship
the
loading
process
ended
the
man
with
the
purple
cloak
who
ridden
the
teetering
up
reappeared
and
came
striding
grandly
down
to
ground
somebody
cast
off
above
ropes
writhed
and
fell
and
dangled
the
ship
air
lock
door
closed
there
was
a
vast
humming
sound
the
ship
lifted
sedately
it
seemed
to
hover
momentarily
over
the
group
of
and
humans
in
the
center
of
the
grid
enclosure
but
it
was
not
hovering
it
shrank
it
was
rising
in
an
absolutely
vertical
line
it
dwindled
to
the
size
of
a
basketball
and
then
an
apple
then
to
the
size
of
a
pea
and
then
that
pea
diminished
until
the
spaceship
from
krim
walden
cetis
rigel
and
the
nearer
rim
had
become
the
size
of
a
dust
mote
and
then
could
not
be
seen
at
all
but
one
knew
that
it
was
going
on
to
lohala
and
tralee
and
famagusta
and
the
coalsack
stars
hoddan
shrugged
and
began
to
trudge
toward
the
warehouses
the
landing
ramp
began
to
roll
slowly
in
the
same
direction
carts
and
wagons
loaded
the
stuff
discharged
from
the
ship
creaking
plodding
with
the
curved
horns
of
the
rising
and
falling
the
wagons
overtook
hoddan
and
passed
him
he
saw
his
ship
bag
on
one
of
the
carts
it
was
a
gift
from
the
interstellar
ambassador
on
walden
assured
hoddan
that
there
was
a
fund
for
the
assistance
of
political
refugees
and
that
the
bag
and
its
contents
was
normal
but
in
addition
to
the
hoddan
had
a
number
of
formerly
equipment
of
the
police
department
of
walden
capital
city
he
followed
his
bag
to
a
warehouse
arrived
there
he
found
the
bag
surrounded
by
a
group
of
whiskered
or
mustachioed
darthian
characters
wearing
felt
pants
and
large
they
had
opened
the
bag
and
were
in
the
act
of
ferocious
dispute
about
who
should
get
what
of
its
contents
incidentally
they
argued
over
the
which
looked
like
weapons
but
were
because
nothing
happened
when
one
pulled
the
trigger
hoddan
grimaced
they
been
in
store
on
the
liner
during
the
voyage
normally
they
picked
up
a
trickle
charge
from
broadcast
power
on
walden
but
there
was
no
broadcast
power
on
the
liner
nor
any
on
darth
they
leaked
their
charges
and
were
quite
useless
the
one
in
his
pocket
would
be
useless
too
he
grimaced
again
and
swerved
to
the
building
where
the
landing
grid
controls
must
be
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
interior
was
smoky
and
but
the
equipment
was
wholly
familiar
two
unshaven
men
in
violently
colored
shirts
languidly
played
cards
only
one
a
redhead
paid
attention
to
the
controls
of
the
landing
grid
he
watched
dials
as
hoddan
pushed
his
way
in
he
threw
a
switch
and
yawned
the
ship
was
five
diameters
out
from
darth
and
he
released
it
from
the
landing
grid
fields
he
turned
and
saw
hoddan
illustration
what
the
hell
do
you
want
he
demanded
sharply
a
few
kilowatts
said
hoddan
the
redhead
manner
was
not
amiable
get
outta
here
he
barked
the
transformers
and
snaky
cables
leading
to
relays
outside
all
were
clear
as
print
to
hoddan
he
moved
confidently
toward
an
especially
understandable
panel
pulling
out
his
and
briskly
breaking
back
the
butt
for
charging
he
shoved
the
pistol
butt
to
contact
with
two
terminals
devised
for
another
purpose
and
the
pistol
slipped
for
an
instant
and
a
blue
spark
flared
quit
that
roared
the
man
the
unshaven
men
pushed
back
from
their
game
of
cards
one
of
them
stood
up
smiling
unpleasantly
the
clicked
hoddan
withdrew
it
from
flipped
the
butt
shut
and
turned
toward
the
three
men
two
of
them
charged
him
suddenly
the
redhead
and
the
unpleasant
smiler
the
hummed
the
redhead
howled
he
been
hit
in
the
hand
his
unshaven
companion
buckled
in
the
middle
and
fell
to
the
floor
the
third
man
backed
away
in
panic
automatically
raising
his
arms
in
surrender
hoddan
saw
no
need
for
further
action
he
nodded
graciously
and
went
out
of
the
control
building
swinging
the
recharged
pistol
in
his
hand
in
the
warehouse
argument
still
raged
over
his
possessions
he
went
in
briskly
nobody
looked
at
him
the
casual
appropriation
of
unguarded
property
was
apparently
a
social
norm
here
the
man
in
the
purple
cloak
was
insisting
furiously
that
he
was
a
darthian
gentleman
and
he
have
his
share
or
else
those
things
said
hoddan
are
mine
put
them
back
faces
turned
to
him
expressing
shocked
surprise
a
man
in
dirty
yellow
pants
stood
up
with
a
suit
of
hoddan
underwear
and
a
pair
of
shoes
he
moved
with
great
dignity
to
depart
the
buzzed
he
leaped
and
howled
and
fled
hoddan
had
aimed
accurately
enough
but
prudence
suggested
that
if
he
appeared
to
kill
anybody
the
matter
might
become
serious
so
he
fired
to
sting
the
man
with
a
bolt
at
about
the
same
spot
where
on
walden
scorched
members
of
a
party
of
police
in
ambush
it
was
nice
shooting
but
this
happened
to
be
a
time
and
place
where
prudence
did
not
pay
there
was
a
concerted
gasp
of
outrage
men
leaped
to
their
feet
large
knives
came
out
of
elaborate
holsters
figures
in
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
all
badly
soiled
roared
their
indignation
and
charged
at
hoddan
they
waved
knives
as
they
came
he
held
down
the
trigger
and
traversed
the
rushing
men
the
whining
buzz
of
the
weapon
was
inaudible
at
first
but
before
he
released
the
trigger
it
was
plainly
to
be
heard
then
there
was
silence
his
attackers
formed
a
very
untidy
heap
on
the
floor
they
breathed
stertorously
hoddan
began
to
retrieve
his
possessions
he
rolled
a
man
over
for
the
purpose
a
pair
of
very
blue
apprehensive
eyes
stared
at
him
their
owner
had
stumbled
over
one
man
and
been
stumbled
over
by
others
he
gazed
up
at
hoddan
speechless
hand
me
that
please
said
hoddan
he
pointed
the
man
in
the
purple
cloak
obeyed
shaking
hoddan
completed
the
recovery
of
all
his
belongings
he
turned
the
man
in
the
purple
cloak
winced
and
closed
his
eyes
said
hoddan
he
needed
information
he
was
likely
to
get
it
from
the
men
in
the
grid
control
room
he
would
hardly
be
popular
with
any
of
these
either
he
irritably
suspected
himself
of
a
tendency
to
make
enemies
unnecessarily
but
he
did
need
directions
he
said
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
one
don
loris
prince
of
lord
of
this
baron
of
that
and
claimant
to
the
dukedom
of
the
other
thing
would
you
have
any
idea
how
i
could
reach
him
the
man
in
the
purple
cloak
gaped
at
hoddan
he
is
my
chieftain
he
said
aghast
i
am
thal
his
most
trusted
retainer
then
he
practically
wailed
you
must
be
the
man
i
was
sent
to
meet
he
sent
me
to
learn
if
you
came
on
the
ship
i
should
have
fought
by
your
side
this
is
disgrace
it
disgraceful
agreed
hoddan
grimly
but
he
who
had
been
born
and
raised
in
a
community
should
not
be
too
critical
of
others
let
it
go
how
do
i
find
him
i
should
take
you
complained
thal
bitterly
but
you
have
killed
all
these
men
their
friends
and
chieftains
are
honor
bound
to
cut
your
throat
and
you
shot
merk
but
he
ran
away
and
he
will
be
summoning
his
friends
to
come
and
kill
you
now
this
is
shame
this
is
then
he
said
hopefully
your
strange
weapon
how
many
men
can
you
fight
if
fifty
we
may
live
to
ride
away
if
more
we
may
even
reach
don
loris
castle
how
many
we
see
what
we
see
said
hoddan
dourly
but
i
better
charge
these
other
pistols
you
can
come
with
me
or
wait
i
have
killed
these
men
they
only
stunned
they
come
around
presently
he
went
out
of
the
warehouse
carrying
the
bag
which
was
again
loaded
with
uncharged
he
went
back
to
the
grid
control
room
he
pushed
it
open
and
entered
for
the
second
time
the
man
swore
and
rubbed
at
his
hand
the
man
who
smiled
unpleasantly
lay
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
the
second
unshaven
man
jittered
visibly
at
sight
of
hoddan
i
back
said
hoddan
politely
for
more
kilowatts
he
put
his
bag
conveniently
close
to
the
terminals
at
which
his
pistols
could
be
recharged
he
snapped
open
a
pistol
butt
and
presented
it
to
the
electric
contacts
quaint
customs
you
have
here
he
said
conversationally
robbing
a
newcomer
resenting
his
need
for
a
few
watts
of
power
that
comes
free
from
the
sky
the
clicked
he
snapped
the
butt
shut
and
opened
another
which
he
placed
in
contact
for
charging
making
him
act
he
said
acidly
with
manners
as
bad
as
the
local
ones
going
at
him
with
knives
so
he
has
to
be
resentful
in
his
turn
the
second
clicked
he
closed
it
and
began
to
charge
a
third
he
said
severely
innocent
tourists
relatively
innocent
ones
anyhow
are
not
likely
to
be
favorably
impressed
with
darth
he
had
the
charging
process
going
swiftly
now
he
began
to
charge
a
fourth
weapon
particularly
bad
manners
he
added
sternly
to
stand
there
grinding
your
teeth
at
me
while
your
friend
behind
the
desk
crawls
after
an
chemical
gun
to
shoot
me
with
he
snapped
the
fourth
pistol
shut
and
went
after
the
man
who
dropped
down
behind
a
desk
he
came
upon
that
man
hopelessly
panicked
just
as
his
hands
closed
on
a
clumsy
gun
that
was
supposed
to
set
off
a
chemical
explosive
to
propel
a
metal
bullet
do
said
hoddan
severely
if
i
have
to
shoot
you
at
this
range
you
have
blisters
he
took
the
weapon
out
of
the
other
man
hands
he
went
back
and
finished
charging
the
rest
of
the
pistols
he
returned
most
of
them
to
his
bag
though
he
stuck
others
in
his
belt
and
pockets
to
the
point
where
he
looked
like
the
pictures
of
space
pirates
but
he
knew
what
space
pirates
were
actually
like
he
moved
to
the
door
as
a
last
thought
he
picked
up
the
weapon
there
only
one
spaceship
here
a
month
he
observed
politely
so
i
be
around
if
you
want
to
get
in
touch
with
me
ask
don
loris
going
to
visit
him
while
i
look
over
professional
opportunities
on
darth
he
went
out
once
more
somehow
he
felt
more
cheerful
than
a
since
when
he
landed
as
the
only
passenger
from
the
space
liner
then
he
felt
ignored
and
lonely
and
friendless
on
a
strange
and
primitive
world
he
still
had
no
friends
but
he
had
already
acquired
some
enemies
and
therefore
material
for
more
or
less
worthwhile
achievement
he
surveyed
the
sunlit
scene
about
him
from
the
door
thal
the
man
had
brought
two
animals
around
to
the
door
of
the
warehouse
hoddan
later
learned
that
they
were
horses
he
was
frenziedly
in
the
act
of
mounting
one
of
them
as
he
climbed
up
small
bright
metal
disks
cascaded
from
a
pocket
he
tried
to
stop
the
flow
of
money
as
he
got
feverishly
into
the
saddle
from
the
small
town
a
mob
of
some
thirty
mounted
men
plunged
toward
the
landing
grid
they
wore
garments
of
yellow
and
blue
and
magenta
they
waved
knives
and
made
bloodthirsty
noises
thal
saw
them
and
bolted
riding
one
horse
and
towing
the
other
by
a
lead
rope
it
happened
that
his
line
of
retreat
passed
by
where
hoddan
stood
hoddan
held
up
his
hand
thal
reined
in
mount
he
cried
hoarsely
mount
and
ride
hoddan
passed
up
the
chemical
powder
gun
thal
seized
it
frantically
hurry
he
panted
don
loris
would
have
my
throat
cut
if
i
deserted
you
mount
and
ride
hoddan
painstakingly
fastened
his
bag
to
the
saddle
of
the
lead
horse
he
unfastened
the
lead
rope
he
noticed
that
thal
pulled
in
the
leather
reins
to
stop
the
horse
he
seen
that
he
kicked
it
furiously
to
urge
it
on
he
deduced
that
one
steered
the
animal
by
pulling
on
one
strap
or
the
other
he
climbed
clumsily
to
a
seat
there
was
a
howl
from
the
racing
mounted
men
they
waved
their
knives
and
yelled
in
zestful
anticipation
of
murder
hoddan
pulled
on
a
rein
his
horse
turned
obediently
he
kicked
it
the
animal
broke
into
a
run
toward
the
rushing
mob
the
jolting
motion
amazed
hoddan
one
could
not
shoot
straight
while
being
shaken
up
like
this
he
dragged
back
on
the
reins
the
horse
stopped
come
yelled
thal
despairingly
this
way
quick
hoddan
got
out
a
sitting
erect
frowning
a
little
in
his
concentration
he
began
to
take
at
the
charging
small
horde
three
of
them
got
close
enough
to
be
blistered
when
bolts
hit
them
others
toppled
from
their
saddles
at
distances
ranging
from
one
hundred
yards
to
twenty
a
good
dozen
however
saw
what
was
happening
in
time
to
swerve
their
mounts
and
hightail
it
away
but
there
were
eighteen
heaps
of
garments
on
the
ground
inside
the
landing
grid
two
or
three
of
them
squirmed
and
swore
hoddan
had
partly
missed
on
them
he
heard
the
chemical
weapon
booming
thunderously
now
that
victory
was
won
thal
was
shooting
valorously
hoddan
held
up
his
hand
for
cease
fire
thal
rode
up
beside
him
not
quite
believing
what
he
seen
wonderful
he
said
shakily
wonderful
don
loris
will
be
pleased
he
will
give
me
gifts
for
my
help
to
you
this
is
a
great
fight
we
will
be
great
men
after
this
then
let
go
and
brag
said
hoddan
thal
was
shocked
you
need
me
he
said
commiseratingly
it
is
fortunate
that
don
loris
chose
me
to
fight
beside
you
he
sent
his
horse
trotting
toward
the
mostly
unconscious
men
on
the
ground
he
alighted
hoddan
saw
him
happily
and
publicly
pick
the
pockets
of
the
victims
he
came
back
beaming
and
now
swaggering
in
his
saddle
we
will
be
famous
he
said
zestfully
two
against
thirty
and
some
ran
away
he
gloated
and
it
was
a
good
haul
we
share
of
course
because
we
are
companions
is
it
the
custom
asked
hoddan
mildly
to
loot
defenseless
men
but
of
course
said
thal
how
else
can
a
gentleman
live
if
he
has
no
chieftain
to
give
him
presents
you
defeated
them
so
of
course
you
take
their
possessions
ah
yes
said
hoddan
to
be
sure
he
rode
on
the
road
was
a
mere
horse
track
presently
it
was
less
than
that
he
saw
a
frowning
battlemented
stronghold
away
off
to
the
left
thal
openly
hoped
that
somebody
would
come
from
that
castle
and
try
to
charge
them
toll
for
riding
over
their
lord
land
after
hoddan
had
knocked
them
over
with
the
thal
would
add
to
the
heavy
weight
of
coins
already
in
his
possession
it
did
not
look
promising
in
a
way
but
just
before
sunset
hoddan
saw
three
tiny
bright
lights
flash
across
the
sky
from
west
to
east
they
moved
in
formation
and
at
identical
speeds
hoddan
knew
a
spaceship
in
orbit
when
he
saw
one
he
bristled
and
muttered
under
his
breath
what
that
asked
thal
what
did
you
say
i
said
said
hoddan
dourly
that
i
got
to
do
something
about
walden
when
they
get
an
idea
in
their
heads
iv
according
to
the
fiction
tapes
the
colonized
worlds
of
the
galaxy
vary
wildly
from
each
other
in
cold
and
unromantic
fact
it
is
so
space
travel
is
too
cheap
and
solar
systems
too
numerous
to
justify
the
settlement
of
hostile
worlds
there
no
point
in
trying
to
live
where
one
has
to
put
on
special
equipment
every
time
he
goes
outdoors
there
no
reason
to
settle
on
a
world
where
one
ca
grow
the
kind
of
vegetation
one
ancestors
adapted
themselves
to
some
tens
of
thousands
of
generations
ago
it
simply
does
make
sense
so
the
inhabited
worlds
of
the
galaxy
are
farther
apart
than
they
could
be
perhaps
and
much
more
alike
than
is
necessary
but
the
human
race
has
a
predilection
for
gravity
fields
not
too
far
from
accellerative
force
we
humans
were
designed
for
something
like
that
we
prefer
foodstuffs
containing
familiar
amino
compounds
our
metabolism
was
designed
around
them
and
since
our
geneticists
have
learned
how
to
put
aggressiveness
into
the
genes
of
plants
why
nowadays
they
briskly
overwhelm
the
native
flora
wherever
they
are
introduced
and
it
rational
to
let
it
happen
if
people
are
to
thrive
and
multiply
on
new
worlds
as
they
are
colonized
it
more
convenient
to
modify
the
worlds
to
fit
the
colonists
than
the
colonists
to
fit
the
worlds
therefore
bron
hoddan
encountered
no
remarkable
features
in
the
landscape
of
darth
as
he
rode
through
the
deepening
night
there
was
grass
which
was
not
luxuriant
there
were
bushes
which
were
not
unduly
lush
there
were
trees
and
birds
and
various
other
commonplace
living
things
whose
forebears
had
been
dumped
on
darth
some
centuries
before
the
ecological
system
had
worked
itself
out
strictly
by
but
the
result
was
not
unfamiliar
save
for
the
overhead
hoddan
could
have
believed
himself
on
some
parts
of
zan
or
some
parts
of
walden
or
very
probably
somewhere
or
other
on
lohala
or
kent
or
famagusta
or
any
other
occupied
world
between
the
rims
there
was
though
the
hoddan
tried
to
organize
it
in
his
mind
he
knew
where
the
sun
had
set
which
would
be
west
he
asked
the
latitude
of
the
darthian
spaceport
thal
did
not
know
it
he
asked
about
major
geographical
features
seas
and
continents
and
so
on
thal
had
no
ideas
on
the
subject
hoddan
fumed
he
had
worried
about
such
things
on
walden
of
course
on
walden
he
had
one
friend
derec
and
believed
he
had
a
sweetheart
nedda
there
he
was
lonely
and
schemed
to
acquire
the
admiration
of
others
he
ignored
the
sky
here
on
darth
he
had
no
friends
but
there
were
a
number
of
local
citizens
now
doubtless
recovered
from
bolts
and
yearning
to
carve
him
up
with
large
knives
he
did
not
feel
lonely
but
the
instinct
to
know
where
he
was
was
again
in
operation
the
ground
was
rocky
and
far
from
level
after
two
hours
of
riding
on
a
small
and
wiry
horse
with
no
springs
hoddan
hurt
in
a
great
many
places
he
never
known
he
owned
he
and
thal
rode
in
an
indeterminate
direction
with
an
irregular
scarp
of
low
mountains
silhouetted
against
the
unfamiliar
stars
a
vagrant
blew
thal
had
said
it
was
a
ride
to
don
loris
castle
after
something
over
two
of
them
he
said
meditatively
i
think
that
if
you
wish
to
give
me
a
present
i
will
take
it
and
not
make
a
gift
in
return
you
could
give
me
he
added
helpfully
your
share
of
the
plunder
from
our
victims
why
demanded
hoddan
why
should
i
give
you
a
present
if
i
accepted
it
explained
thal
and
made
no
gift
in
return
i
would
become
your
retainer
then
it
would
be
my
obligation
as
a
darthian
gentleman
to
ride
beside
you
advise
counsel
and
fight
in
your
defense
and
generally
to
uphold
your
dignity
hoddan
suspected
himself
of
blisters
in
places
that
had
no
dignity
about
them
he
said
suspiciously
how
about
don
loris
are
you
his
retainer
between
the
two
of
us
said
thal
he
stingy
his
presents
are
not
as
lavish
as
they
could
be
i
can
make
him
a
of
part
of
the
money
we
won
in
combat
that
frees
me
of
duty
to
him
then
i
could
accept
the
balance
of
the
money
from
you
and
become
a
retainer
of
yours
oh
said
hoddan
you
need
a
retainer
badly
said
thal
you
do
not
know
the
customs
here
for
example
there
is
enmity
between
don
loris
and
the
young
lord
ghek
if
the
young
lord
ghek
is
as
enterprising
as
he
should
be
some
of
his
retainers
should
be
lying
in
wait
to
cut
our
throats
as
we
approach
don
loris
stronghold
said
hoddan
grimly
but
thal
seemed
undisturbed
this
system
of
gifts
and
presents
sounds
complicated
why
does
don
loris
simply
give
you
so
much
a
year
or
week
or
whatnot
thal
made
a
shocked
sound
that
would
be
pay
a
darthian
gentleman
does
not
serve
for
pay
to
offer
it
would
be
insult
then
he
said
listen
he
reined
in
hoddan
clumsily
followed
his
example
after
a
moment
or
two
thal
clucked
to
his
horse
and
started
off
again
it
was
nothing
he
said
regretfully
i
hoped
we
were
riding
into
an
ambush
hoddan
grunted
it
could
be
that
he
was
being
told
a
tall
tale
but
back
at
the
spaceport
the
men
who
came
after
him
waving
large
knives
had
seemed
sincere
enough
why
should
we
be
ambushed
he
asked
and
why
do
you
hope
for
it
your
weapons
would
destroy
our
enemies
said
thal
placidly
and
the
pickings
would
be
good
he
added
we
should
be
ambushed
because
the
lady
fani
refused
to
marry
the
lord
ghek
she
is
don
loris
daughter
and
to
refuse
to
marry
a
man
is
naturally
a
deadly
insult
so
he
should
ravage
don
loris
lands
at
every
opportunity
until
he
gets
a
chance
to
carry
off
the
lady
fani
and
marry
her
by
force
that
is
the
only
way
the
insult
can
be
wiped
out
i
see
said
hoddan
ironically
he
did
the
two
horses
topped
a
rise
and
far
in
the
distance
there
was
a
yellow
light
with
a
mist
above
it
as
of
illuminated
smoke
that
is
don
loris
stronghold
said
thal
he
sighed
it
looks
like
we
may
not
be
ambushed
they
were
it
was
very
dark
where
the
horses
forged
ahead
through
brushwood
as
they
moved
onward
the
single
light
became
two
they
were
great
bonfires
burning
in
iron
cages
some
forty
feet
up
in
the
air
those
cages
projected
from
the
battlements
of
a
massive
wall
there
was
no
light
anywhere
else
underneath
the
stars
thal
rode
almost
underneath
the
cressets
and
shouted
upward
a
voice
answered
presently
a
gate
clanked
open
and
a
black
cavelike
opening
appeared
behind
it
thal
rode
grandly
in
and
hoddan
followed
now
that
the
ride
seemed
over
he
let
himself
realize
where
he
ached
from
the
unaccustomed
exercise
everywhere
he
also
guessed
at
the
area
of
his
skin
first
rubbed
to
blisters
and
then
to
the
discomfort
of
raw
flesh
underneath
the
gate
clanked
shut
torches
waved
overhead
hoddan
found
that
he
and
thal
had
ridden
into
a
very
tiny
courtyard
twenty
feet
above
them
an
inner
battlemented
wall
offered
excellent
opportunities
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
to
throw
things
down
at
visitors
who
after
admission
turned
out
to
be
undesired
thal
shouted
further
identifications
including
a
boastful
and
entirely
untruthful
declaration
that
he
and
hoddan
together
had
slaughtered
twenty
men
in
one
place
and
thirty
in
another
and
left
them
lying
in
their
gore
the
voices
that
replied
sounded
derisive
somebody
came
down
a
rope
and
fastened
the
gate
from
the
inside
with
an
extreme
amount
of
creaking
an
inner
gate
swung
wide
men
came
out
of
it
and
took
the
horses
hoddan
dismounted
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
creaked
as
loudly
as
the
gate
thal
swaggered
displaying
coins
he
had
picked
from
the
pockets
of
the
men
the
had
disabled
he
said
splendidly
to
hoddan
i
go
to
announce
your
coming
to
don
loris
these
are
his
retainers
they
will
give
you
to
drink
he
added
amiably
if
you
were
given
food
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
cut
your
throat
he
disappeared
hoddan
carried
his
ship
bag
and
followed
a
man
in
a
dirty
pink
shirt
to
a
room
containing
a
table
and
a
chair
he
sat
down
relieved
to
have
a
rest
for
his
back
the
man
in
the
pink
shirt
brought
him
a
flagon
of
wine
he
disappeared
again
hoddan
drank
sour
wine
and
brooded
he
was
very
hungry
and
very
tired
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
disillusioned
in
a
new
dimension
morbidly
he
remembered
a
frequently
given
lecture
from
his
grandfather
on
zan
it
no
use
it
was
the
custom
of
his
grandfather
to
say
there
not
a
bit
o
use
in
having
brains
all
they
do
is
get
you
into
trouble
a
lucky
idiot
ten
times
better
off
than
a
brainy
man
with
a
jinx
on
him
a
smart
man
starts
thinkin
and
he
thinks
himself
into
a
jail
cell
if
his
luck
is
bad
and
good
luck
wasted
on
him
because
it
reasonable
and
he
do
believe
in
it
when
it
happens
it
taken
me
a
lifetime
to
keep
my
brains
from
ruinin
me
no
sir
i
hope
none
o
my
descendants
inherit
my
brains
i
pity
if
they
do
hoddan
had
been
on
darth
not
more
than
four
hours
in
that
time
found
himself
robbed
had
resented
it
had
been
the
object
of
two
spirited
attempts
at
assassination
had
ridden
an
excruciating
number
of
miles
on
an
unfamiliar
animal
and
now
found
himself
in
a
stone
dungeon
and
deprived
of
food
lest
feeding
him
obligate
his
host
not
to
cut
his
throat
and
he
gotten
into
this
by
himself
he
chosen
it
practically
asked
for
it
he
began
strongly
to
share
his
grandfather
disillusioned
view
of
brains
after
a
long
time
the
door
of
the
cell
opened
thal
was
back
chastened
don
loris
wants
to
talk
to
you
he
said
in
a
subdued
voice
he
not
pleased
hoddan
took
another
gulp
of
the
wine
he
picked
up
his
ship
bag
and
limped
to
the
door
he
decided
painfully
that
he
was
limping
on
the
wrong
leg
he
tried
the
other
no
improvement
he
really
needed
to
limp
on
both
he
followed
a
singularly
silent
thal
through
a
long
stone
corridor
and
up
stone
steps
until
they
came
to
a
monstrous
hall
with
torches
in
holders
on
the
side
walls
it
was
barbarically
hung
with
banners
but
it
was
not
exactly
a
cheery
place
at
the
far
end
logs
burned
in
a
great
fireplace
don
loris
sat
in
a
carved
chair
beside
it
wizened
and
in
a
velvet
robe
with
a
peevish
expression
on
his
face
my
chieftain
said
thal
subduedly
here
is
the
engineer
from
walden
hoddan
scowled
at
don
loris
whose
expression
of
peevishness
did
not
lighten
he
did
regard
hoddan
with
a
flicker
of
interest
however
a
stranger
who
unfeignedly
scowls
at
a
feudal
lord
with
no
superior
and
many
inferiors
is
anyhow
a
novelty
thal
tells
me
said
don
loris
fretfully
that
you
and
he
together
slaughtered
some
dozens
of
the
retainers
of
my
neighbors
today
i
consider
it
unfortunate
they
may
ask
me
to
have
the
two
of
you
hanged
and
it
would
be
impolite
to
refuse
hoddan
said
truculently
i
considered
it
impolite
for
your
neighbors
retainers
to
march
toward
me
waving
large
knives
and
announcing
what
they
intended
to
do
to
my
inwards
with
them
yes
agreed
don
loris
impatiently
i
concede
that
point
it
is
natural
enough
to
act
hastily
at
such
times
but
still
how
many
did
you
kill
none
said
hoddan
curtly
i
shot
them
with
i
just
charged
in
the
control
room
of
the
landing
grid
don
loris
sat
up
straight
he
demanded
sharply
you
used
on
darth
naturally
on
darth
said
hoddan
with
some
tartness
i
was
here
but
nobody
was
killed
one
or
two
may
be
slightly
blistered
all
of
them
had
their
pockets
picked
by
thal
i
understand
that
is
a
local
custom
there
nothing
to
worry
about
but
don
loris
stared
at
him
aghast
but
this
is
deplorable
he
protested
used
here
it
is
the
one
thing
i
would
have
given
strict
orders
to
avoid
my
neighbors
will
talk
about
it
some
of
them
may
even
think
about
it
you
could
have
used
any
other
weapon
but
of
all
things
why
did
you
have
to
use
a
because
i
had
one
said
hoddan
briefly
horrible
said
don
loris
peevishly
the
worst
thing
you
could
possibly
have
done
i
have
to
disown
you
unmistakably
you
have
to
disappear
at
once
we
blame
it
on
ghek
retainers
hoddan
said
disappear
me
vanish
said
don
loris
i
suppose
there
no
real
necessity
to
cut
your
throat
but
you
plainly
have
to
disappear
though
it
would
have
been
much
more
discreet
if
you
simply
gotten
killed
i
was
indiscreet
to
survive
demanded
hoddan
bristling
extremely
so
snapped
don
loris
here
i
had
you
come
all
the
way
from
walden
to
help
arrange
a
delicate
matter
and
before
you
traveled
even
the
few
miles
to
my
castle
within
minutes
of
landing
on
darth
you
spoiled
everything
i
am
a
reasonable
man
but
there
are
the
facts
you
used
so
you
have
to
disappear
i
think
it
generous
for
me
to
say
only
until
people
on
darth
forget
that
such
things
exist
but
the
two
of
you
oh
for
a
year
or
so
there
are
some
fairly
cozy
dungeons
hoddan
seethed
suddenly
he
tried
to
do
something
brilliant
on
walden
and
had
been
framed
for
jail
for
life
he
defended
his
life
and
property
on
darth
and
nearly
the
same
thing
popped
up
as
a
prospect
hoddan
angrily
suspected
fate
and
chance
of
plain
conspiracy
against
him
but
there
was
an
interruption
a
clanking
of
arms
sounded
somewhere
nearby
men
with
long
gruesome
glittering
spears
came
through
a
doorway
they
stood
aside
a
girl
entered
the
great
hall
more
spearmen
followed
her
they
stopped
by
the
door
the
girl
came
across
the
hall
she
was
a
pretty
girl
but
hoddan
hardly
noticed
the
fact
with
so
many
other
things
on
his
mind
he
had
no
time
for
girls
thal
behind
him
said
in
a
quivering
voice
my
lady
fani
i
beg
you
to
plead
with
your
father
for
his
most
faithful
retainer
the
girl
looked
surprisedly
at
him
her
eyes
fell
on
hoddan
she
looked
interested
hoddan
at
that
moment
was
very
nearly
as
disgusted
and
as
indignant
as
a
man
could
be
he
did
not
look
romantically
at
her
which
to
the
lady
fani
daughter
of
that
don
loris
who
was
prince
of
this
and
baron
of
that
and
so
on
was
news
he
did
not
look
at
her
at
all
he
ground
his
teeth
do
try
to
wheedle
me
fani
snapped
don
loris
i
am
a
reasonable
man
but
i
indulge
you
too
much
even
to
allowing
you
to
refuse
that
young
imbecile
ghek
with
no
end
of
inconvenience
as
a
result
but
i
will
not
have
you
question
my
decision
about
thal
and
this
hoddan
person
the
girl
said
pleasantly
of
course
not
father
but
what
have
they
done
the
two
of
them
snapped
don
loris
again
fought
twenty
men
today
and
defeated
all
of
them
thal
plundered
them
then
thirty
other
men
mounted
tried
to
avenge
the
first
and
they
defeated
them
also
thal
plundered
eighteen
and
all
this
was
permissible
if
unlikely
but
they
did
it
with
everybody
within
news
range
will
talk
of
it
they
know
that
this
hoddan
came
to
darth
to
see
me
they
suspect
that
i
imported
new
weapons
for
political
purposes
they
guess
at
the
prettiest
scheme
i
had
these
twenty
years
the
girl
stood
still
a
spearman
leaned
his
weapon
against
the
wall
raced
across
the
hall
shifted
a
chair
to
a
convenient
position
for
the
lady
fani
to
sit
on
it
and
raced
back
to
his
fellows
she
sat
down
but
did
they
really
defeat
so
many
she
asked
marveling
wonderful
and
thal
was
undoubtedly
fighting
in
defense
of
someone
told
him
to
protect
as
a
loyal
retainer
should
do
was
he
i
wish
fumed
her
father
that
you
would
not
throw
in
irrelevances
i
sent
him
to
bring
this
hoddan
here
this
afternoon
not
to
massacre
my
neighbors
retainers
or
rather
not
to
not
massacre
them
a
little
would
have
done
no
harm
but
he
was
protecting
somebody
he
was
told
to
protect
said
fani
and
this
other
man
this
hoddan
bron
hoddan
said
her
father
irritably
yes
he
was
protecting
himself
doubtless
he
thought
he
did
me
a
service
in
doing
that
but
if
he
only
let
himself
get
killed
quietly
the
whole
affair
would
be
simplified
the
lady
fani
said
with
quiet
dignity
by
the
same
reasoning
father
it
would
simplify
things
greatly
if
i
let
the
lord
ghek
kidnap
me
it
not
the
same
thing
at
all
at
least
said
fani
i
would
have
a
pack
of
spearmen
following
me
about
like
puppies
everywhere
i
go
it
not
the
same
their
breaths
smelling
of
wine
except
when
they
smell
of
beer
and
they
breathe
very
noisily
and
it
not
and
it
especially
unreasonable
said
the
lady
fani
with
even
greater
dignity
when
you
could
put
thal
and
this
hoddan
person
on
duty
to
guard
me
instead
if
they
can
fight
twenty
and
thirty
men
at
once
all
by
themselves
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
think
much
of
my
safety
when
you
want
to
lock
them
up
somewhere
instead
of
using
them
to
keep
your
daughter
safe
from
that
particularly
horrible
ghek
don
loris
swore
in
a
cracked
voice
then
he
said
to
end
the
argument
i
think
it
over
until
tomorrow
now
go
away
fani
beaming
rose
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
he
squirmed
she
turned
to
leave
and
beckoned
casually
for
thal
and
hoddan
to
follow
her
my
chieftain
said
thal
tremulously
do
we
depart
too
yes
rasped
don
loris
get
out
of
my
sight
thal
moved
with
agility
in
the
wake
of
the
lady
fani
hoddan
picked
up
his
bag
and
followed
this
he
considered
darkly
was
in
the
nature
of
a
reprieve
only
and
if
those
three
spaceships
overhead
did
come
from
walden
but
why
three
the
lady
fani
went
out
the
door
she
entered
by
some
of
the
spearmen
went
ahead
and
others
closed
in
behind
her
hoddan
followed
there
were
stone
steps
leading
upward
they
were
steep
and
uneven
and
interminable
hoddan
climbed
on
aching
legs
for
what
seemed
ages
stars
appeared
the
leading
spearmen
stepped
out
on
a
flagstoned
level
area
when
hoddan
got
there
he
saw
that
they
had
arrived
at
the
battlements
of
a
high
part
of
the
castle
wall
starlight
showed
a
rambling
wall
of
circumvallation
with
peaked
roofs
inside
it
he
could
look
down
into
a
courtyard
where
a
fire
burned
and
several
men
busily
did
things
beside
it
but
there
were
no
other
lights
beyond
the
castle
wall
the
ground
stretched
away
toward
a
nearby
range
of
rugged
low
mountains
it
was
vaguely
splotched
with
different
degrees
of
darkness
where
fields
and
pastures
and
woodland
copses
stood
here
a
bench
said
fani
cheerfully
and
you
can
sit
down
beside
me
and
explain
things
what
your
name
again
and
where
did
you
come
from
i
bron
hoddan
said
hoddan
he
found
himself
scowling
i
come
from
zan
where
everybody
is
a
space
pirate
my
grandfather
heads
the
most
notorious
of
the
pirate
gangs
wonderful
said
fani
admiringly
i
knew
you
could
be
just
an
ordinary
person
and
fight
like
my
father
said
you
did
today
thal
cleared
his
throat
lady
fani
hush
said
fani
you
a
nice
old
that
father
sent
to
the
spaceport
because
he
figured
you
be
too
timid
to
get
into
trouble
hush
to
hoddan
she
said
interestedly
now
tell
me
all
about
the
fighting
it
must
have
been
terrible
she
watched
him
with
her
head
on
one
side
expectantly
the
fighting
i
did
today
said
hoddan
angrily
was
exactly
as
dangerous
and
as
difficult
as
shooting
fish
in
a
bucket
a
little
more
trouble
but
not
much
even
in
the
starlight
he
could
see
that
her
expression
was
more
admiring
than
before
i
thought
you
say
something
like
that
she
said
contentedly
go
on
that
all
said
hoddan
quite
all
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
he
told
her
he
added
drearily
i
rode
a
horse
for
three
hours
today
i
not
used
to
it
i
ache
your
father
is
thinking
of
putting
me
in
a
dungeon
until
some
scheme
or
other
of
his
goes
through
i
disappointed
i
worried
about
three
lights
that
went
across
the
sky
at
sundown
and
i
simply
too
tired
and
befuddled
for
normal
conversation
oh
said
fani
if
i
may
take
my
leave
said
hoddan
querulously
i
get
some
rest
and
do
some
thinking
when
i
get
up
i
hope
to
have
more
entertaining
things
to
say
he
got
to
his
feet
and
picked
up
his
bag
where
do
i
go
he
asked
fani
regarded
him
enigmatically
thal
squirmed
thal
will
show
you
then
fani
said
deliberately
bron
hoddan
will
you
fight
for
me
thal
plucked
anxiously
at
his
arm
hoddan
said
politely
if
at
all
desirable
yes
but
now
i
must
get
some
sleep
thank
you
said
fani
i
am
troubled
by
the
lord
ghek
she
watched
him
move
away
thal
moaning
softly
went
with
him
down
another
monstrosity
of
a
stone
stairway
oh
what
folly
mourned
thal
i
tried
to
warn
you
you
would
not
pay
attention
when
the
lady
fani
asked
if
you
would
fight
for
her
you
should
have
said
if
her
father
permitted
you
that
honor
but
you
said
yes
the
spearmen
heard
you
now
you
must
either
fight
the
lord
ghek
within
a
night
and
day
or
be
disgraced
i
doubt
said
hoddan
tiredly
that
the
obligations
of
darthian
gentility
apply
to
the
grandson
of
a
pirate
or
an
escap
to
me
he
been
about
to
say
an
escaped
criminal
from
walden
but
caught
himself
in
time
but
they
do
apply
said
thal
shocked
a
man
who
has
been
disgraced
has
no
rights
any
man
may
plunder
him
any
man
may
kill
him
at
will
but
if
he
resists
plundering
or
kills
anybody
else
in
he
is
hanged
hoddan
stopped
short
in
his
descent
of
the
uneven
stone
steps
that
me
from
now
on
he
said
sardonically
of
course
the
lady
fani
did
mean
to
put
me
on
such
a
spot
you
were
not
polite
explained
thal
she
persuaded
her
father
out
of
putting
us
in
a
dungeon
until
he
thought
of
us
again
you
should
at
least
have
shown
good
manners
you
should
have
said
that
you
came
here
across
deserts
and
flaming
oceans
because
of
the
fame
of
her
beauty
you
might
have
said
you
heard
songs
of
her
sweetness
beside
campfires
half
a
world
away
she
might
not
have
believed
you
but
hold
it
said
hoddan
that
just
manners
what
would
you
say
to
a
girl
you
really
liked
oh
then
said
thal
you
get
complimentary
hoddan
went
heavily
down
the
rest
of
the
steps
he
was
not
in
the
least
pleased
on
a
strange
world
with
strange
customs
and
with
his
weapons
losing
their
charge
every
hour
he
did
not
need
any
handicaps
but
if
he
got
into
a
category
such
as
thal
described
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
said
seething
when
you
tucked
me
in
bed
go
back
and
ask
the
lady
fani
to
arrange
for
me
to
have
a
horse
and
permission
to
go
fight
this
lord
ghek
right
after
breakfast
he
was
too
much
enraged
to
think
further
he
let
himself
be
led
into
some
sort
of
quarters
which
probably
answered
don
loris
description
of
a
cozy
dungeon
thal
vanished
and
came
back
with
ointments
for
blisters
but
no
food
he
explained
again
that
food
given
to
hoddan
would
make
it
disgraceful
to
cut
his
throat
and
hoddan
swore
poisonously
but
stripped
off
his
garments
and
smeared
himself
lavishly
where
he
had
lost
skin
the
ointment
stung
like
fire
and
he
presently
lay
awake
in
a
sort
of
dreary
fury
and
he
was
ravenous
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
lay
awake
for
aeons
but
he
must
have
dozed
off
because
he
was
awakened
by
a
yell
it
was
not
a
complete
yell
only
the
first
part
of
one
it
stopped
in
a
particularly
unpleasant
fashion
and
its
echoes
went
reverberating
through
the
stony
walls
of
the
castle
hoddan
was
out
of
bed
with
a
in
his
hand
in
a
hurry
before
that
first
yell
was
followed
by
other
shouts
and
outcries
by
the
clashing
of
steel
upon
steel
and
all
the
frenzied
tumult
of
combat
in
the
dark
the
uproar
moved
in
seconds
the
sound
of
fighting
came
from
a
plainly
different
direction
as
if
a
striking
force
of
some
sort
went
rushing
through
only
indifferently
defended
corridors
it
would
not
pass
before
hoddan
door
but
he
growled
to
himself
on
a
feudal
world
presumably
one
might
expect
anything
but
there
was
a
situation
in
being
here
in
which
etiquette
required
a
rejected
suitor
to
carry
off
a
certain
scornful
maiden
by
force
some
young
lordling
named
ghek
had
to
carry
off
fani
or
be
considered
a
man
of
no
spirit
a
gun
went
off
somewhere
it
was
a
powder
gun
exploding
violently
to
send
a
metal
bullet
somewhere
it
went
off
again
there
was
an
instant
almost
of
silence
then
an
intolerable
screeching
of
triumph
and
shrieks
of
another
sort
entirely
and
the
excessively
loud
clash
of
arms
once
more
hoddan
was
clothed
now
at
least
clothed
enough
to
have
places
to
stick
he
jerked
on
the
door
to
open
it
irritably
demanding
of
himself
how
he
would
know
which
side
was
which
or
for
that
matter
which
side
he
should
fight
on
the
door
was
locked
he
raged
he
flung
himself
against
it
and
it
barely
quivered
it
was
barred
on
the
outside
he
swore
in
highly
indecorous
terms
and
tore
his
bedstead
apart
to
get
a
the
fighting
reached
a
climax
he
heard
a
girl
scream
and
without
question
knew
that
it
was
the
lady
fani
and
equally
without
question
knew
that
he
would
fight
to
keep
any
girl
from
being
abducted
by
a
man
she
did
want
to
marry
he
swung
the
log
which
was
the
corner
post
of
his
bed
something
cracked
he
swung
again
the
sound
of
battle
changed
to
that
of
a
running
fight
the
objective
of
the
raiders
had
been
reached
having
gotten
what
they
came
for
and
it
could
only
be
fani
they
retreated
swiftly
fighting
only
to
cover
their
retreat
hoddan
swung
his
bed
leg
with
furious
anger
he
heard
a
flurry
of
yells
and
sword
strokes
and
a
fierce
desperate
cry
from
fani
among
them
and
a
plank
in
his
door
gave
way
he
struck
again
the
running
raiders
poured
past
a
corner
some
yards
away
he
battered
and
swore
swore
and
battered
as
the
tumult
moved
and
he
suddenly
heard
a
scurrying
thunder
of
horses
hoofs
outside
the
castle
altogether
there
were
yells
of
derisive
triumph
and
the
pounding
rumbling
sound
of
horses
headed
away
in
the
night
until
it
was
lost
still
raging
inarticulately
hoddan
crashed
his
small
log
at
the
door
he
was
not
consciously
concerned
about
the
distress
don
loris
might
feel
over
the
abduction
of
his
daughter
but
there
is
an
instinct
in
most
men
against
the
forcing
of
a
girl
to
marriage
against
her
will
hoddan
battered
at
his
door
around
him
the
castle
began
to
hum
like
a
hive
of
bees
women
cried
out
or
exclaimed
and
men
shouted
furiously
to
one
another
and
fighting
men
came
belatedly
looking
for
somebody
to
fight
dragging
weapons
behind
them
and
not
knowing
where
to
find
enemies
bron
hoddan
probably
made
as
much
noise
as
any
four
of
them
somebody
brought
a
light
somewhere
near
it
shone
through
the
cracks
in
the
splintered
planks
he
could
see
to
aim
he
smote
savagely
and
the
door
came
apart
it
fell
outward
and
he
found
himself
in
the
corridor
outside
being
stared
at
by
complete
strangers
it
the
engineer
someone
explained
to
someone
else
i
saw
him
when
he
rode
in
with
thal
i
want
thal
said
hoddan
coldly
i
want
a
dozen
horses
i
want
men
to
ride
them
with
me
he
pushed
his
way
forward
which
way
to
the
stables
but
then
he
went
back
and
picked
up
his
bag
of
his
air
was
purposeful
and
his
manner
furious
the
retainers
of
don
loris
were
in
an
extremely
apologetic
frame
of
mind
the
lady
fani
had
been
carried
off
into
the
night
by
a
raiding
party
undoubtedly
led
by
lord
ghek
the
defenders
of
the
castle
had
prevented
it
so
there
was
no
special
reason
to
obey
hoddan
but
there
was
every
reason
to
seem
to
be
doing
something
useful
he
found
himself
almost
swept
along
by
agitated
retainers
trying
to
look
as
if
they
were
about
a
purposeful
affair
they
went
down
a
long
ramp
calling
uneasily
to
each
other
they
eddied
around
a
place
where
two
men
lay
quite
still
on
the
floor
then
there
were
shouts
of
thal
this
way
thal
and
hoddan
found
himself
in
a
small
courtyard
doubtless
inside
a
it
was
filled
with
milling
figures
and
many
waving
torches
and
there
was
thal
desperately
pale
and
frightened
behind
him
there
was
don
loris
his
eyes
burning
and
his
hands
twitching
literally
speechless
from
fury
pick
a
dozen
men
thal
commanded
hoddan
get
on
horses
get
a
horse
for
me
dammit
i
show
how
to
use
the
as
we
ride
thal
panted
shaking
they
hamstrung
most
of
the
horses
get
the
ones
that
are
left
barked
hoddan
he
suddenly
raged
at
don
loris
here
another
time
get
used
on
darth
object
to
this
if
you
want
to
hoofbeats
thal
on
a
horse
that
shied
and
reared
at
the
flames
and
confusion
other
horses
skittish
and
scared
with
the
smell
of
spilt
blood
in
their
nostrils
fighting
the
men
who
led
them
their
eyes
rolling
thal
called
names
as
he
looked
about
him
there
was
plenty
of
light
as
he
called
a
name
a
man
climbed
on
a
horse
men
thrust
swords
spears
all
manner
of
weapons
upon
them
some
of
the
chosen
men
swaggered
because
of
their
choice
some
looked
woefully
unhappy
but
with
don
loris
glaring
frenziedly
upon
them
in
the
smoky
glare
no
man
refused
hoddan
climbed
ungracefully
upon
the
mount
that
four
or
five
men
held
for
him
thal
with
a
fine
sense
of
drama
seized
a
torch
and
waved
it
above
his
head
there
was
a
vast
creaking
and
an
unsuspected
gate
opened
and
thal
rode
out
with
a
great
clattering
of
hoofs
and
the
others
rode
out
after
him
there
were
lights
everywhere
about
the
castle
now
all
along
the
battlements
men
had
set
light
to
and
lowered
them
partway
down
the
walls
to
disclose
any
attacking
force
which
might
have
dishonorable
intentions
toward
the
stronghold
others
waved
torches
from
the
battlements
thal
swung
his
torch
and
pointed
to
the
ground
they
rode
here
he
called
to
hoddan
they
ride
for
ghek
castle
hoddan
said
angrily
put
out
that
light
do
you
want
to
advertise
how
few
we
are
and
what
we
doing
here
ride
close
thal
flung
down
the
torch
and
horses
trod
it
underfoot
as
the
knot
of
men
rode
on
thal
boomed
the
pickings
should
be
good
eh
why
do
you
want
me
you
got
to
learn
something
snapped
hoddan
here
this
is
a
it
set
for
firing
only
you
hold
it
so
with
your
finger
along
this
rod
you
point
your
finger
at
a
man
and
pull
this
trigger
the
pistol
will
buzz
briefly
you
let
the
trigger
loose
and
point
at
another
man
and
pull
the
trigger
again
understand
do
try
to
use
it
over
ten
yards
you
no
marksman
there
on
a
galloping
horse
beside
hoddan
in
the
darkness
thal
zestfully
repeated
his
lesson
show
another
man
and
send
him
to
me
for
a
pistol
hoddan
commanded
curtly
i
be
showing
others
he
turned
to
the
man
who
rode
too
close
to
his
left
before
he
had
fully
instructed
that
man
another
clamored
for
a
weapon
on
his
right
this
was
hardly
adequate
training
in
the
use
of
modern
weapons
for
that
matter
hoddan
was
hardly
qualified
to
give
military
instruction
only
gone
on
two
pirate
voyages
himself
but
little
boys
on
zan
played
at
pirate
in
dutiful
emulation
of
their
parents
at
least
the
possibilities
of
were
envisioned
in
their
childish
games
so
hoddan
knew
more
about
how
to
fight
with
than
somebody
who
knew
nothing
at
all
the
band
of
pursuing
horsemen
pounded
through
the
dark
night
under
strangely
patterned
stars
hoddan
held
on
to
his
saddle
and
barked
out
instructions
to
teach
darthians
how
to
shoot
he
felt
very
queer
he
began
to
worry
with
the
lights
of
don
loris
castle
long
vanished
behind
he
began
to
realize
how
very
small
his
troop
was
thal
had
said
something
about
horses
being
hamstrung
there
must
then
have
been
two
attacking
parties
one
swarmed
into
the
stables
to
draw
all
defending
retainers
there
then
the
other
poured
over
a
wall
or
in
through
a
and
rushed
for
the
lady
apartments
the
point
was
that
the
attackers
had
made
sure
there
could
be
only
a
token
pursuit
they
knew
they
were
many
times
stronger
than
any
who
might
come
after
them
it
would
be
absurd
for
them
to
flee
hoddan
kicked
his
horse
and
got
up
to
the
front
of
the
column
of
riders
in
the
night
thal
he
snapped
they
be
idiots
if
they
keep
on
running
away
now
they
too
far
off
to
worry
about
men
on
foot
they
stop
and
wait
for
us
most
of
them
anyhow
we
riding
into
an
ambush
good
pickings
eh
said
thal
idiot
yelped
hoddan
these
men
know
you
you
know
what
i
can
do
with
tell
them
we
riding
into
ambush
they
to
follow
close
behind
us
two
tell
them
they
not
to
shoot
at
anybody
more
than
five
yards
off
and
not
coming
at
them
and
if
any
man
stops
to
plunder
i
kill
him
personally
thal
gaped
at
him
not
stop
to
plunder
ghek
wo
snapped
hoddan
he
take
fani
on
to
his
castle
leaving
most
of
his
men
behind
to
massacre
us
thal
reined
aside
and
hoddan
pounded
on
at
the
head
of
the
tiny
troop
this
was
the
second
time
in
his
life
he
been
on
a
horse
it
was
two
too
many
this
adventure
was
not
exhilarating
it
came
into
his
mind
depressingly
that
supposedly
stirring
action
like
this
was
really
no
more
satisfying
than
piracy
fani
had
tricked
him
into
a
fix
in
which
he
had
to
fight
ghek
or
be
disgraced
and
to
be
disgraced
on
darth
was
equivalent
to
suicide
his
horse
came
to
a
gentle
rise
in
the
ground
it
grew
steeper
the
horse
slacked
in
its
galloping
the
incline
grew
steeper
still
the
horse
slowed
to
a
walk
which
it
pursued
with
a
rhythmically
tossing
head
it
was
only
less
uncomfortable
than
a
gallop
the
dim
outline
of
trees
appeared
overhead
perfect
place
for
an
ambush
hoddan
reflected
dourly
he
got
out
a
he
set
the
stud
for
continuous
fire
something
he
had
dared
trust
to
the
others
his
horse
breasted
the
rise
there
was
a
yell
ahead
and
dim
figures
plunged
toward
him
he
painstakingly
made
ready
to
swing
his
from
his
extreme
right
across
the
space
before
him
and
all
the
way
to
the
extreme
left
the
pistol
should
be
capable
of
continuous
fire
for
four
seconds
but
it
was
operating
on
stored
charge
he
did
dare
count
on
more
than
three
he
pulled
the
trigger
the
hummed
though
its
noise
was
inaudible
through
the
yells
of
the
charging
partisans
of
the
lord
ghek
illustration
v
hoddan
swore
from
the
depths
of
a
very
considerable
vocabulary
you
censored
deleted
omitted
unprintability
he
roared
get
back
up
on
your
horse
or
i
blast
you
and
leave
you
for
ghek
men
to
handle
when
they
able
to
move
about
again
get
back
on
that
horse
one
two
the
man
got
back
on
the
horse
now
go
on
ahead
rasped
hoddan
all
of
you
i
going
to
count
you
the
dozen
horsemen
from
don
loris
stronghold
rode
reluctantly
on
ahead
he
did
count
them
he
rode
on
shepherding
them
before
him
ghek
he
told
them
in
a
tone
has
a
bigger
prize
than
any
cash
you
plunder
from
one
of
his
retainers
he
got
the
lady
fani
he
wo
stop
before
he
has
her
behind
castle
walls
we
got
to
catch
up
with
him
do
you
want
to
try
to
climb
into
his
castle
by
your
fingernails
you
do
it
if
he
gets
there
first
the
horses
moved
a
little
faster
thal
said
with
surprising
humility
if
we
force
our
horses
too
much
they
be
exhausted
before
we
can
catch
up
figure
it
out
snapped
hoddan
we
have
to
catch
up
he
settled
down
to
more
of
the
acute
discomfort
that
riding
was
to
him
he
did
not
think
again
of
the
ambush
it
had
happened
and
it
had
failed
of
the
raiding
party
that
had
fought
its
way
into
don
loris
stronghold
and
out
again
had
been
waiting
for
pursuers
atop
a
certain
bit
of
rising
ground
they
known
their
pursuers
must
come
this
way
there
were
certain
passes
through
the
low
but
rugged
hills
one
went
this
way
or
that
but
no
other
their
blood
already
warmed
by
past
fighting
when
hoddan
and
his
dozen
seemed
to
ride
right
into
destruction
they
flung
themselves
into
a
charge
but
hoddan
had
a
set
for
continuous
fire
he
used
it
like
a
hose
or
a
machine
gun
painstakingly
sweeping
it
across
the
night
before
him
neither
too
fast
nor
too
slowly
it
affected
the
rushing
followers
of
lord
ghek
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
an
oversized
they
went
down
only
three
men
remained
in
their
saddles
they
probably
been
sheltered
by
the
bodies
of
men
ahead
hoddan
attended
to
those
three
with
individual
personalized
bolts
and
immediately
had
trouble
with
his
men
who
wanted
to
dismount
and
plunder
their
fallen
enemies
he
would
even
let
them
collect
the
horses
of
the
men
now
out
of
action
it
would
cost
time
and
ghek
would
be
losing
any
that
he
could
help
with
a
raging
trembling
girl
as
prisoner
most
men
would
want
to
get
her
behind
battlements
as
soon
as
possible
but
hoddan
knew
that
his
party
was
slowed
down
by
him
presently
he
began
to
feel
bitterly
sure
that
ghek
would
reach
his
castle
before
he
was
overtaken
this
place
he
heading
for
he
said
discouragedly
to
thal
any
chance
of
our
rushing
it
oh
no
said
thal
dolefully
ten
men
could
hold
it
against
a
thousand
then
ca
we
make
better
time
thal
said
resignedly
ghek
probably
had
fresh
horses
waiting
so
he
could
keep
on
at
top
speed
in
his
flight
i
doubt
we
will
catch
him
now
the
lady
fani
said
hoddan
bitterly
has
put
me
in
a
fix
so
if
i
do
fight
him
i
ruined
disgraced
corrected
thal
he
said
mournfully
it
the
same
thing
gloom
descended
on
the
whole
party
as
it
filled
their
leaders
insensibly
the
pace
of
the
horses
slackened
still
more
they
had
done
well
but
a
horse
that
can
cover
fifty
miles
a
day
at
its
own
gait
can
be
exhausted
in
ten
or
less
if
pushed
by
the
time
hoddan
and
his
men
were
within
two
miles
of
ghek
castle
their
mounts
were
extremely
reluctant
to
move
faster
than
a
walk
at
a
mile
they
were
kept
in
motion
only
by
kicks
the
route
they
followed
was
specific
there
was
no
choice
of
routes
here
in
the
hills
they
could
only
follow
every
twist
and
turn
of
the
trail
among
steep
and
minor
peaks
but
suddenly
they
came
to
a
clear
wide
valley
yellow
cressets
burned
at
its
upper
end
no
more
than
half
a
mile
distant
they
showed
a
castle
gate
open
with
the
last
of
a
party
of
horsemen
filing
into
it
even
as
hoddan
swore
the
gate
closed
faint
shouts
of
triumph
came
from
inside
the
castle
walls
to
the
completely
frustrated
pursuers
without
i
have
bet
on
this
said
hoddan
miserably
stop
here
thal
pick
out
a
couple
of
your
more
characters
and
fix
them
up
with
their
hands
apparently
tied
behind
their
backs
we
take
a
breather
for
five
minutes
no
more
he
would
not
let
any
man
dismount
he
shifted
himself
about
on
his
own
saddle
trying
to
find
a
comfortable
way
to
sit
he
failed
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
gave
orders
there
were
still
shouts
occasionally
from
within
ghek
castle
they
had
that
unrhythmic
frequency
which
suggested
that
they
were
responses
to
a
speech
ghek
was
making
a
fine
dramatic
spectacle
of
his
capture
of
an
unwilling
bride
he
was
addressing
his
retainers
and
saying
that
through
their
fine
loyalty
and
willingness
to
risk
all
for
their
chieftain
they
now
had
the
lady
fani
to
be
their
chatelaine
he
thanked
them
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
they
were
invited
to
the
official
wedding
which
would
take
place
sometime
tomorrow
most
likely
before
the
speech
was
quite
finished
however
hoddan
and
his
weary
following
rode
up
into
the
patch
of
light
cast
by
the
cressets
outside
the
walls
thal
bellowed
to
the
battlements
prisoners
he
roared
according
to
instructions
from
hoddan
we
caught
some
prisoners
in
the
ambush
they
got
fancy
news
tell
lord
ghek
he
better
get
their
story
right
off
no
time
to
waste
urgent
hoddan
played
the
part
of
one
prisoner
just
in
case
anybody
noticed
from
above
that
one
man
rode
as
if
either
entirely
unskilled
in
riding
or
else
injured
in
a
fight
he
heard
shoutings
over
the
walls
he
glared
at
his
men
and
they
drooped
in
their
saddles
the
gate
creaked
open
and
the
horsemen
from
don
loris
castle
filed
inside
they
showed
no
elation
because
hoddan
had
promised
to
ram
a
its
full
length
down
the
throat
of
any
man
who
gave
away
his
stratagem
ahead
of
time
the
gate
closed
behind
them
men
appeared
to
take
their
horses
this
could
have
revealed
that
the
newcomers
were
strangers
but
ghek
would
have
recruited
new
and
extra
retainers
for
the
emergency
of
tonight
there
would
be
many
strange
faces
in
his
castle
just
now
good
fight
eh
bellowed
an
ancient
retainer
with
a
wine
bottle
in
his
hand
good
fight
agreed
thal
good
plunder
eh
bellowed
the
ancient
above
the
heads
of
younger
men
like
the
good
old
days
better
boomed
thal
at
just
this
instant
the
young
lord
ghek
appeared
there
were
scratches
on
his
cheek
acquired
during
the
ride
with
fani
across
his
saddlebow
he
looked
thrilled
by
his
victory
but
uneasy
about
his
prize
what
this
about
prisoners
with
fancy
news
he
demanded
what
is
it
don
loris
whooped
thal
long
live
the
lady
fani
hoddan
painstakingly
opened
fire
with
the
stud
of
this
pistol
his
third
tonight
pressed
down
the
merrymakers
in
the
courtyard
wavered
and
went
down
in
windrows
thal
opened
fire
with
a
the
others
bellowed
and
began
to
fling
bolts
at
every
living
thing
they
saw
to
the
lady
fani
rasped
hoddan
getting
off
his
horse
with
as
many
creakings
as
the
castle
gate
his
followers
now
rushed
dismounting
where
they
had
to
they
fired
with
reckless
abandon
a
which
does
not
kill
imposes
few
restraints
upon
its
user
if
you
shoot
somebody
who
does
need
to
be
shot
he
may
not
like
it
but
he
is
permanently
harmed
so
the
twelve
who
followed
hoddan
poured
in
what
would
have
been
a
murderous
fire
if
they
been
shooting
bullets
but
was
no
worse
than
devastating
as
matters
stood
there
were
screams
and
flight
and
utterly
hopeless
defiances
by
and
men
in
instants
hoddan
went
limping
into
the
castle
with
thal
by
his
side
searching
for
fani
ghek
had
not
fallen
at
the
first
fire
he
vanished
and
the
castle
was
plainly
fallen
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
lead
resistance
against
its
invaders
men
went
raging
happily
through
corridors
and
halls
as
they
came
to
them
they
used
their
with
zest
and
at
such
close
quarters
with
considerable
effect
hoddan
heard
fani
scream
angrily
and
he
and
thal
went
swiftly
to
see
they
came
upon
the
young
lord
ghek
trying
to
let
fani
down
out
of
a
window
on
a
rope
he
undoubtedly
intended
to
follow
her
and
complete
his
abduction
on
the
run
but
fani
bit
him
and
hoddan
said
vexedly
look
here
it
seems
that
i
disgraced
if
i
do
fight
you
somehow
the
young
lord
ghek
rushed
him
sword
out
eyes
blazing
in
a
fine
frenzy
of
despair
hoddan
brought
him
down
with
a
buzz
of
the
one
of
hoddan
followers
came
hunting
for
him
sir
he
sputtered
we
got
the
garrison
cornered
in
their
quarters
and
we
been
picking
them
off
through
the
windows
and
they
think
they
dropping
dead
and
want
to
surrender
shall
we
let
by
all
means
hoddan
said
irritably
and
thal
go
get
something
heavier
than
a
nightgown
for
the
lady
fani
to
wear
and
then
do
what
plundering
is
practical
but
i
want
to
be
out
of
here
in
half
an
hour
understand
i
attend
to
the
costume
said
the
lady
fani
vengefully
you
cut
his
throat
while
i
getting
dressed
she
nodded
at
the
unconscious
lord
ghek
on
the
pavement
she
disappeared
through
a
door
nearby
hoddan
could
guess
that
ghek
would
have
prepared
something
elaborate
in
the
way
of
a
trousseau
for
the
bride
he
was
to
carry
screaming
from
her
home
somehow
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
a
darthian
would
do
now
fani
would
enjoyably
attire
herself
in
the
best
of
it
while
thal
said
hoddan
help
me
get
this
character
into
a
closet
somewhere
he
not
to
be
killed
i
do
like
him
but
at
this
moment
i
do
like
anybody
very
much
and
i
wo
play
favorites
thal
dragged
the
insensible
young
nobleman
into
the
next
room
hoddan
locked
the
door
and
pocketed
the
key
as
fani
came
into
view
again
she
was
splendidly
attired
now
in
brocade
and
jewels
ghek
had
evidently
hoped
to
placate
her
after
marriage
by
things
of
that
sort
and
had
spent
lavishly
for
them
now
throughout
the
castle
there
were
many
and
diverse
noises
sometimes
not
often
there
was
still
the
crackling
hum
of
a
there
were
many
more
exuberant
shoutings
they
apparently
had
to
do
with
loot
there
were
some
squealings
in
female
voices
but
many
more
gigglings
i
need
not
say
said
the
lady
fani
with
dignity
that
i
thank
you
very
much
but
i
do
say
so
you
quite
welcome
said
hoddan
politely
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
imagine
said
hoddan
that
we
go
down
into
the
courtyard
where
our
horses
are
i
gave
my
men
half
an
hour
to
loot
in
during
that
half
hour
i
shall
sit
down
on
something
which
will
i
hope
remain
perfectly
still
and
i
may
he
added
morbidly
eat
an
apple
i
had
nothing
to
eat
since
i
landed
on
darth
people
do
want
to
commit
themselves
to
not
cutting
my
throat
but
after
half
an
hour
we
leave
the
lady
fani
looked
sympathetic
but
the
castle
surrendered
to
you
she
protested
you
hold
it
are
you
going
to
try
to
keep
it
there
are
a
good
many
unpleasant
characters
out
yonder
said
hoddan
waving
his
hand
at
the
great
outdoors
who
reason
to
dislike
me
very
much
they
be
anxious
to
express
their
emotions
when
they
feel
up
to
it
i
want
to
dodge
them
and
presently
the
people
in
this
castle
will
realize
that
even
ca
keep
on
shooting
indefinitely
here
i
do
want
to
be
around
when
it
occurs
to
them
he
offered
his
arm
with
a
reasonably
grand
air
and
went
limping
with
her
down
to
the
courtyard
just
inside
the
gate
two
of
don
loris
retainers
staggered
into
view
as
they
arrived
piling
up
plunder
which
ranged
from
a
quarter
keg
of
wine
to
a
mass
of
frothy
stuff
which
must
be
female
garments
they
went
away
and
other
men
arrived
loaded
down
with
their
own
accumulations
of
loot
some
of
the
local
inhabitants
looked
on
with
uneasy
indignation
hoddan
found
a
bench
and
sat
down
he
conspicuously
displayed
one
of
the
weapons
which
had
captured
the
castle
ghek
defeated
retainers
looked
at
him
darkly
bring
me
something
to
eat
commanded
hoddan
then
if
you
bring
fresh
horses
for
my
men
and
one
extra
for
each
to
carry
his
plunder
on
take
them
away
i
even
throw
in
the
lord
ghek
who
is
now
unharmed
but
with
his
life
in
the
balance
otherwise
he
moved
the
pistol
suggestively
the
normal
inhabitants
of
castle
moved
away
discussing
the
situation
in
subdued
voices
the
lady
fani
sat
down
proudly
on
the
bench
beside
him
you
are
wonderful
she
said
with
conviction
i
used
to
cherish
that
illusion
myself
said
hoddan
but
nobody
before
in
all
darthian
history
has
ever
fought
twenty
men
and
then
thirty
men
and
destroyed
an
ambush
and
captured
a
castle
all
in
one
day
and
without
a
meal
said
hoddan
darkly
and
with
a
lot
of
blisters
he
considered
somebody
came
running
with
bread
and
cheese
and
wine
he
bit
into
the
bread
and
cheese
after
a
moment
he
said
his
mouth
full
i
once
saw
a
man
perform
the
unparalleled
feat
of
jumping
over
nine
barrels
placed
in
a
row
it
had
never
been
done
before
but
i
envy
him
i
never
wanted
to
jump
over
nine
barrels
in
a
row
in
the
same
way
i
never
especially
wanted
to
fight
other
men
or
break
up
ambushes
or
capture
castles
i
want
to
do
what
i
want
to
do
not
what
other
people
happen
to
admire
then
what
do
you
want
to
do
she
asked
admiringly
i
not
sure
now
said
hoddan
gloomily
he
took
a
fresh
bite
but
a
little
while
ago
i
wanted
to
do
some
interesting
and
useful
things
in
electronics
and
get
reasonably
rich
and
marry
a
delightful
girl
and
become
a
prominent
citizen
on
walden
i
think
i
settle
for
another
planet
now
my
father
will
make
you
rich
said
the
girl
proudly
you
saved
me
from
being
married
to
ghek
hoddan
shook
his
head
i
got
my
doubts
he
said
he
had
a
scheme
to
import
a
lot
of
and
arm
his
retainers
with
them
then
he
meant
to
rush
the
spaceport
and
have
me
set
up
a
unit
that
keep
them
charged
all
the
time
then
he
sit
back
and
enjoy
life
holding
the
spaceport
nobody
else
could
get
and
nobody
could
resist
his
retainers
who
had
so
he
be
top
man
on
darth
he
have
exactly
as
much
power
as
he
chose
to
seize
i
think
he
cherished
that
little
idea
and
i
given
advance
publicity
to
now
he
has
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
pulling
it
off
i
afraid
he
be
displeased
with
me
i
can
take
care
of
that
said
fani
confidently
she
did
not
question
that
her
father
would
be
displeased
maybe
you
can
said
hoddan
but
though
he
kept
a
daughter
he
lost
a
dream
and
that
bereavement
i
know
horses
came
plodding
into
the
courtyard
with
ghek
retainers
driving
them
they
were
anxious
to
get
rid
of
their
conquerors
hoddan
men
came
trickling
back
with
armsful
of
plunder
to
add
to
the
piles
previously
gathered
thal
took
charge
commanding
the
exchange
of
saddles
from
tired
to
fresh
horses
and
that
the
booty
be
packed
on
the
extra
mounts
it
was
time
nine
of
the
dozen
looters
were
at
work
on
the
task
when
there
was
a
tumult
back
in
the
castle
yellings
and
the
clash
of
steel
hoddan
shook
his
head
bad
somebody
pistol
went
empty
and
the
local
boys
found
it
out
now
we
have
to
fight
some
more
no
he
beckoned
to
a
listening
tense
resentful
inhabitant
of
the
castle
he
held
up
the
key
of
the
room
in
which
he
locked
young
ghek
now
open
the
castle
gate
he
commanded
and
fetch
out
my
last
three
men
and
we
leave
without
setting
fire
to
anything
the
lord
ghek
would
like
it
that
way
he
locked
up
in
a
room
that
particularly
inflammable
the
last
statement
was
a
guess
only
but
ghek
retainer
looked
horrified
he
bellowed
there
was
a
subtle
change
in
the
bitterly
hostile
atmosphere
men
came
angrily
to
help
load
the
spare
horses
hoddan
last
three
men
came
out
of
a
corridor
wiping
blood
from
various
scratches
and
complaining
plaintively
that
their
pistols
had
shot
empty
and
they
had
to
defend
themselves
with
knives
three
minutes
later
the
cavalcade
rode
out
of
the
castle
gate
and
away
into
the
darkness
hoddan
had
arrived
here
when
ghek
was
inside
with
fani
as
his
prisoner
when
there
were
only
a
dozen
men
without
and
at
least
a
hundred
inside
to
defend
the
walls
and
the
castle
was
considered
impregnable
in
half
an
hour
hoddan
followers
had
taken
the
castle
rescued
fani
looted
it
superficially
gotten
fresh
horses
for
themselves
and
spare
ones
for
their
plunder
and
were
headed
away
again
in
only
one
respect
were
they
worse
off
than
when
they
arrived
some
were
empty
hoddan
searched
the
sky
and
pieced
together
the
he
noted
before
hold
it
he
said
sharply
to
thal
we
do
go
back
the
same
way
we
came
the
gang
that
ambushed
us
will
be
stirring
around
again
and
we
have
got
full
now
we
make
a
wide
circle
around
those
characters
why
demanded
thal
there
are
only
so
many
passes
the
only
other
one
is
three
times
as
long
and
it
is
disgraceful
to
avoid
a
fight
thal
snapped
an
icy
voice
from
beside
hoddan
you
have
an
order
obey
it
even
in
the
darkness
hoddan
could
see
thal
jump
yes
my
lady
fani
said
thal
shakily
but
we
go
a
long
distance
roundabout
the
direction
of
motion
through
the
night
now
changed
the
long
line
of
horses
moved
in
deepest
darkness
lessened
only
by
the
light
of
many
stars
even
so
in
time
one
eyes
grew
accustomed
and
it
was
a
glamorous
spectacle
beasts
moving
through
dark
defiles
and
over
steep
passes
among
the
rugged
ragged
hills
from
any
one
spot
they
seemed
at
once
to
swagger
and
to
slink
swaying
as
they
moved
on
and
vanished
into
obscurity
the
small
wild
things
in
the
night
paused
affrightedly
in
their
scurryings
until
they
had
gone
far
away
illustration
fani
said
in
a
soft
voice
this
is
nice
what
nice
about
it
demanded
hoddan
riding
like
this
said
fani
enthusiastically
with
men
who
have
fought
for
me
to
guard
me
in
the
darkness
with
the
leader
who
has
rescued
me
by
my
side
underneath
the
stars
it
a
delicious
feeling
you
used
to
riding
horseback
said
hoddan
dourly
he
rode
on
while
mountains
stabbed
skyward
and
the
pass
they
followed
wound
this
way
and
that
and
he
knew
that
it
was
a
very
roundabout
way
indeed
and
he
had
unpleasing
prospects
to
make
it
seem
less
satisfying
even
than
it
would
have
been
otherwise
but
they
came
at
last
to
a
narrow
defile
which
opened
out
before
them
and
there
were
no
more
mountains
ahead
but
only
foothills
and
there
far
and
far
away
they
could
see
the
sky
as
vaguely
brighter
as
they
went
on
indeed
a
glory
of
red
and
golden
colorings
appeared
at
the
horizon
and
out
of
that
magnificence
three
bright
lights
suddenly
darted
in
strict
they
flashed
from
the
sunrise
toward
the
west
they
went
overhead
more
brilliant
than
the
brightest
stars
and
when
partway
down
to
the
horizon
they
suddenly
winked
out
what
on
earth
are
they
demanded
fani
i
never
saw
anything
like
that
before
they
spaceships
in
orbit
said
hoddan
he
was
as
astounded
as
the
girl
but
for
a
different
reason
i
thought
they
be
landed
by
now
it
changed
everything
he
could
not
see
what
the
change
amounted
to
but
change
there
was
for
one
thing
we
going
to
the
spaceport
he
told
thal
curtly
we
recharge
our
there
i
thought
those
ships
had
landed
they
have
now
we
see
if
we
can
keep
them
aloft
how
far
to
the
landing
grid
you
insisted
complained
thal
that
we
not
go
back
to
don
castle
by
the
way
we
left
it
there
are
only
so
many
passes
through
the
hills
the
only
other
one
is
very
long
we
are
only
four
miles
then
we
head
there
right
now
snapped
hoddan
and
we
step
up
the
speed
he
barked
commands
to
his
followers
thal
puzzled
but
in
dread
of
acid
comment
from
fani
bustled
up
and
down
the
line
of
men
insisting
on
a
faster
pace
and
the
members
of
the
cavalcade
had
not
pushed
these
animals
as
they
had
their
first
even
the
lead
horses
loaded
with
loot
managed
to
get
up
to
a
respectable
ambling
trot
the
sunrise
proceeded
dew
upon
the
straggly
grass
became
visible
separate
drops
appeared
as
gems
upon
the
grass
blades
and
then
began
gradually
to
vanish
as
the
sun
disk
showed
itself
then
the
angular
metal
framework
of
the
landing
grid
rose
dark
against
the
sunrise
sky
when
they
rode
up
to
it
hoddan
reflected
that
it
was
the
only
really
civilized
structure
on
the
planet
architecturally
it
was
surely
the
least
pleasing
it
had
been
built
when
darth
was
first
settled
on
and
when
ideas
of
commerce
and
interstellar
trade
seemed
reasonable
it
was
half
a
mile
high
and
built
of
massive
metal
beams
it
loomed
hugely
overhead
when
the
double
file
of
shaggy
horses
trotted
under
its
lower
arches
and
across
the
space
within
it
hoddan
headed
purposefully
for
the
control
shed
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
anywhere
the
steeply
gabled
roofs
of
the
nearby
town
showed
only
the
fluttering
of
tiny
birds
no
smoke
rose
from
chimneys
yet
the
slanting
morning
sunshine
was
bright
as
hoddan
actually
reached
the
control
shed
he
saw
a
sleepy
man
in
the
act
of
putting
a
key
in
the
door
he
dismounted
within
feet
of
that
man
who
turned
and
blinked
sleepily
at
him
and
then
immediately
looked
the
reverse
of
cordial
it
was
the
man
he
stung
with
a
the
day
before
i
come
back
said
hoddan
for
a
few
more
kilowatts
the
man
swore
angrily
hush
said
hoddan
gently
the
lady
fani
is
with
us
the
man
jerked
his
head
around
and
paled
thal
glowered
at
him
others
of
don
loris
retainers
shifted
their
positions
significantly
to
make
their
oversized
handier
we
come
in
said
hoddan
thal
collect
the
pistols
and
bring
them
inside
fani
swung
lightly
to
the
ground
and
followed
him
in
she
looked
curiously
at
the
cables
and
instrument
boards
and
switches
inside
on
one
wall
a
red
light
pulsed
and
went
out
and
pulsed
again
the
man
looked
at
it
you
being
called
said
hoddan
do
answer
it
the
man
scowled
thal
came
in
with
an
armful
of
in
various
stages
of
discharge
hoddan
briskly
broke
the
butt
of
one
of
his
own
and
presented
it
to
the
terminals
he
used
the
day
before
he
not
to
touch
anything
thal
said
hoddan
to
the
man
he
observed
i
suspect
that
call
been
coming
in
all
night
something
was
in
orbit
at
sundown
you
closed
up
shop
and
went
home
early
eh
why
not
rasped
the
man
there
only
one
ship
a
month
sometimes
said
hoddan
there
are
specials
but
i
commend
your
negligence
it
was
probably
good
for
me
he
charged
one
pistol
and
snapped
its
butt
shut
and
snapped
open
another
and
charged
it
there
was
no
difficulty
of
course
in
minutes
all
the
pistols
he
brought
from
walden
were
ready
for
use
again
he
tucked
away
as
many
as
he
could
conveniently
carry
on
his
person
he
handed
the
rest
to
thal
he
went
competently
to
the
pulsing
he
put
headphones
to
his
ears
he
listened
his
expression
became
extremely
strange
as
if
he
did
not
quite
understand
nor
wholly
believe
what
he
heard
odd
he
said
mildly
he
considered
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
rummaged
around
in
the
drawers
of
desks
he
found
wire
clips
he
began
to
snip
wires
in
half
the
man
started
forward
automatically
take
care
of
him
thal
said
hoddan
he
cut
the
microwave
receiver
free
of
its
wires
and
cables
he
lifted
it
experimentally
and
opened
part
of
its
case
to
make
sure
the
thermo
battery
that
would
power
it
in
an
emergency
was
there
and
in
working
order
it
was
put
this
on
a
horse
thal
commanded
hoddan
we
taking
it
up
to
don
loris
the
man
mouth
dropped
open
he
said
stridently
hey
you
ca
do
that
hoddan
turned
upon
him
and
he
said
sourly
all
right
you
can
i
not
trying
to
stop
you
with
all
those
hard
cases
outside
you
can
build
another
in
a
week
said
hoddan
kindly
you
must
have
spare
parts
thal
carried
the
communicator
outside
hoddan
opened
a
cabinet
threw
switches
and
painstakingly
cut
and
snipped
and
snipped
at
a
tangle
of
wires
within
just
your
instrumentation
he
explained
to
the
appalled
man
you
wo
use
the
grid
until
you
got
this
fixed
too
a
few
days
of
harder
work
than
you
used
to
that
all
he
led
the
way
out
again
and
on
the
way
explained
to
fani
pretty
job
this
grid
they
make
simpler
ones
nowadays
they
be
able
to
repair
it
though
in
time
now
we
go
back
to
your
father
castle
he
may
not
be
pleased
but
he
should
be
mollified
he
saw
fani
mount
lightly
into
her
own
saddle
and
shook
his
head
gloomily
he
climbed
clumsily
into
his
own
they
moved
off
to
return
to
don
loris
stronghold
hoddan
suffered
they
reached
the
castle
before
noon
and
the
sight
of
the
lady
fani
riding
beside
a
hoddan
was
productive
of
enthusiasm
and
loud
cheers
the
loot
displayed
by
the
returned
wayfarers
increased
the
rejoicing
there
was
envy
among
the
men
who
had
stayed
behind
there
were
respectfully
admiring
looks
cast
upon
hoddan
he
had
displayed
in
furnishing
opportunities
for
plunder
the
quality
a
leader
of
feudal
fighting
men
could
show
the
lady
fani
beamed
as
she
and
thal
and
hoddan
all
very
dusty
and
presented
themselves
to
her
father
in
the
castle
great
hall
here
your
daughter
sir
said
hoddan
and
yawned
i
hope
there
wo
be
any
further
trouble
with
ghek
we
took
his
castle
and
looted
it
a
little
and
brought
back
some
extra
horses
then
we
went
to
the
spaceport
i
recharged
my
and
put
the
landing
grid
out
of
order
for
the
time
being
i
brought
away
the
communicator
there
he
yawned
again
there
something
highly
improper
going
on
up
just
beyond
atmosphere
there
are
three
ships
up
there
in
orbit
and
they
were
trying
to
call
the
spaceport
in
nonregulation
fashion
and
possible
that
some
of
your
neighbors
would
be
interested
so
i
postponed
everything
until
i
could
get
some
sleep
it
seemed
to
me
that
when
better
skulduggeries
are
concocted
that
don
loris
and
his
associates
ought
to
concoct
them
and
if
you
excuse
me
he
moved
away
practically
dead
on
his
feet
if
he
had
been
accustomed
to
horseback
riding
he
would
have
been
so
exhausted
but
now
he
yawned
and
yawned
and
thal
took
him
to
a
room
quite
different
from
the
to
which
he
been
taken
the
night
before
he
noted
that
the
door
this
time
opened
inward
he
braced
chairs
against
it
to
make
sure
that
nobody
could
open
it
from
without
he
lay
down
and
slept
heavily
he
was
waked
by
loud
poundings
he
roused
himself
enough
to
say
sleepily
whaddyawant
the
lights
in
the
sky
cried
fani
voice
outside
the
door
the
ones
you
say
are
spaceships
it
sunset
again
and
i
just
saw
them
but
there
are
three
now
now
there
are
nine
all
right
said
hoddan
he
lay
down
his
head
again
and
thrust
it
into
his
pillow
then
he
was
suddenly
very
wide
awake
indeed
he
sat
up
with
a
start
nine
spaceships
that
was
possible
that
would
be
a
space
fleet
and
there
were
no
space
fleets
walden
would
certainly
have
never
sent
more
than
one
ship
to
demand
his
surrender
to
its
police
the
space
patrol
never
needed
more
than
one
ship
anywhere
commerce
would
cause
ships
to
travel
in
company
piracy
there
could
be
a
pirate
fleet
never
be
enough
loot
anywhere
to
keep
it
in
operation
nine
spaceships
at
one
time
traveling
in
orbit
around
a
primitive
planet
like
darth
a
fleet
of
spaceships
it
could
happen
hoddan
could
conceive
of
such
a
thing
but
a
recently
developed
pessimism
suggested
that
since
everything
else
to
date
had
been
to
his
disadvantage
this
was
probably
a
catastrophe
also
he
groaned
and
lay
down
to
sleep
again
vi
when
frantic
bangings
on
the
door
awakened
him
next
morning
he
confusedly
imagined
that
they
were
noises
in
the
communicator
headphones
and
until
he
heard
his
name
called
tried
drearily
to
make
sense
of
them
but
suddenly
he
opened
his
eyes
somebody
banged
on
the
door
once
more
a
voice
cried
angrily
bron
hoddan
wake
up
or
i
go
away
and
let
whatever
happens
to
you
happen
wake
up
it
was
the
voice
of
the
lady
fani
at
once
indignant
and
tearful
and
solicitous
and
angry
he
rolled
out
of
bed
and
found
himself
dressed
he
had
slept
the
full
night
at
one
time
he
could
rest
for
thinking
about
the
sounds
in
the
communicator
when
he
listened
at
the
spaceport
he
listened
again
and
what
he
heard
made
him
get
his
clothes
on
for
action
that
was
when
he
heard
a
distinctly
waldenian
voice
speaking
communications
speech
with
crisp
distinctness
calling
the
landing
grid
the
other
voices
were
not
waldenian
ones
and
he
grew
dizzy
trying
to
figure
them
out
but
he
was
clothed
and
ready
to
do
whatever
proved
necessary
when
he
realized
that
he
had
the
landing
grid
receiver
that
there
would
be
no
reception
even
of
the
waldenian
call
until
the
landing
grid
crew
had
built
another
out
of
spare
parts
in
store
and
even
then
could
do
much
until
painfully
sorted
out
and
all
the
tangled
wires
that
hoddan
had
cut
that
had
to
be
done
before
the
grid
could
be
used
again
he
gone
back
to
sleep
while
he
tried
to
make
sense
of
things
now
long
after
daybreak
he
shook
himself
and
made
sure
a
was
handy
then
he
said
hello
i
awake
what
up
why
all
the
noise
come
out
of
there
cried
fani
voice
simultaneously
exasperated
and
filled
with
anxiety
things
are
happening
somebody
here
from
walden
they
want
you
hoddan
could
not
believe
it
it
was
too
unlikely
but
he
opened
the
door
and
thal
came
in
and
fani
followed
good
morning
said
hoddan
automatically
thal
said
mournfully
a
bad
morning
bron
hoddan
a
bad
morning
men
from
walden
came
riding
over
the
hills
how
many
two
said
fani
angrily
a
fat
man
in
a
uniform
and
a
young
man
who
looks
like
he
wants
to
cry
they
had
an
escort
of
retainers
from
one
of
my
father
neighbors
they
were
stopped
at
the
gate
of
course
and
they
sent
a
written
message
in
to
my
father
and
he
had
them
brought
inside
right
away
hoddan
shook
his
head
they
probably
said
that
i
a
criminal
and
that
i
should
be
sent
back
to
walden
how
they
get
down
the
landing
grid
is
working
fani
said
viciously
they
landed
in
something
that
used
rockets
it
came
down
close
to
a
castle
over
that
way
only
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
spaceport
they
asked
for
you
they
said
you
have
landed
from
the
last
liner
from
walden
and
because
you
and
thal
fought
so
splendidly
why
talking
about
you
so
the
chieftain
over
there
accepted
a
present
of
money
from
them
and
gave
them
horses
as
a
return
gift
and
sent
them
here
with
a
guard
thal
talked
to
the
guards
the
men
from
walden
have
promised
huge
gifts
of
money
if
they
help
take
you
back
to
the
thing
that
uses
rockets
i
suspect
said
hoddan
that
it
would
be
a
spaceboat
a
lifeboat
yes
with
a
cell
to
keep
me
from
telling
anybody
how
to
make
he
stopped
and
grimaced
if
they
had
time
to
build
one
in
that
certain
they
take
me
to
the
spaceport
in
a
can
and
i
be
hauled
back
to
walden
in
it
fine
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
fani
anxiously
hoddan
ideas
were
not
clear
but
darth
was
not
a
healthy
place
for
him
it
was
extremely
likely
for
example
that
don
loris
would
feel
that
the
very
bad
jolt
he
given
that
astute
schemer
plans
by
using
at
the
spaceport
had
been
neatly
canceled
out
by
his
rescue
of
fani
he
would
regard
hoddan
with
a
mingled
gratitude
and
aversion
that
would
amount
to
calm
detachment
don
loris
could
not
be
counted
on
as
a
really
warm
personal
friend
on
the
other
hand
the
social
system
of
darth
was
not
favorable
to
a
stranger
with
an
already
lurid
reputation
for
fighting
but
whose
weapons
would
be
useless
unless
frequently
recharged
and
who
count
on
that
as
a
steady
thing
as
a
practical
matter
his
best
bet
was
probably
to
investigate
the
nine
inexplicable
ships
overhead
they
had
with
the
waldenians
it
could
be
inferred
that
no
confidential
relationship
existed
up
there
it
was
possible
that
the
nine
ships
and
the
waldenians
did
even
know
of
each
other
presence
there
is
a
lot
of
room
in
space
if
both
called
on
and
listened
on
they
would
not
have
picked
up
each
others
summons
to
the
ground
you
got
to
do
something
insisted
fani
i
saw
father
talking
to
them
he
looked
happy
and
he
never
looks
happy
unless
he
planning
some
skulduggery
i
think
said
hoddan
that
i
have
some
breakfast
if
i
may
as
soon
as
i
fasten
up
my
ship
bag
thal
said
mournfully
if
anything
happens
to
you
something
will
happen
to
me
too
because
i
helped
you
breakfast
first
said
hoddan
that
as
i
understand
it
should
make
it
disgraceful
for
your
father
to
have
my
throat
cut
but
beyond
that
he
said
gloomily
thal
get
a
couple
of
horses
outside
the
wall
we
may
need
to
ride
somewhere
i
very
much
afraid
we
will
but
first
i
like
to
have
some
breakfast
fani
said
disappointedly
but
are
you
going
to
face
them
the
men
from
walden
you
could
shoot
them
hoddan
shook
his
head
it
would
solve
anything
anyhow
a
practical
man
like
your
father
wo
sell
me
out
before
he
sure
i
ca
pay
off
better
i
bet
on
a
conference
with
me
before
he
makes
a
deal
fani
stamped
her
foot
outrageous
think
what
you
saved
me
from
but
she
did
not
question
the
possibility
hoddan
observed
a
practical
man
can
always
make
what
he
wants
to
do
look
like
a
noble
sacrifice
of
personal
inclinations
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
decided
that
i
got
to
be
practical
myself
and
that
one
of
the
rules
how
about
breakfast
he
strapped
the
ship
bag
shut
on
the
his
pockets
would
not
hold
he
made
a
minor
adjustment
to
the
space
communicator
it
was
not
ruined
but
nobody
else
could
use
it
without
much
labor
finding
out
what
he
done
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
his
grandfather
on
zan
would
have
advised
his
grandfather
views
were
explicit
helping
one
neighbor
he
said
frequently
in
hoddan
hearing
while
hoddan
was
a
youth
is
all
right
as
a
job
but
maybe
laying
for
you
you
get
a
chance
to
fix
him
so
he
ca
do
you
no
harm
and
you
a
lot
better
off
and
he
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
neighbor
this
was
definitely
true
of
the
men
from
walden
hoddan
guessed
that
derec
was
one
of
them
the
other
would
represent
the
police
or
the
planetary
government
it
was
probably
just
as
true
of
don
loris
and
others
hoddan
found
himself
disapproving
of
the
way
the
cosmos
was
designed
even
though
presently
he
sat
at
breakfast
high
up
on
the
battlements
and
fani
looked
at
him
with
interesting
anxiety
he
was
filled
with
forebodings
the
future
looked
dark
yet
what
he
asked
of
fate
and
chance
was
so
simple
he
asked
only
a
career
and
riches
and
a
delightful
girl
to
marry
and
the
admiration
of
his
trivial
things
but
it
looked
like
he
have
to
do
battle
for
even
such
minor
gifts
of
destiny
fani
watched
him
breakfast
i
do
understand
you
she
complained
anybody
else
would
be
proud
of
what
he
done
and
angry
with
my
father
or
do
you
think
he
act
ungratefully
of
course
i
do
said
hoddan
then
why
are
you
angry
i
hungry
said
hoddan
and
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
want
to
be
properly
grateful
said
fani
in
one
breath
and
yet
you
have
shown
the
least
appreciation
of
my
getting
two
horses
over
in
that
patch
of
woodland
yonder
she
pointed
and
hoddan
nodded
and
having
thal
there
with
orders
to
serve
you
faithfully
she
stopped
short
don
loris
appeared
beaming
at
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
here
from
the
great
hall
where
conferences
took
place
he
regarded
hoddan
benignly
this
is
a
very
bad
business
my
dear
fellow
he
said
benevolently
has
fani
told
you
of
the
people
who
arrived
from
walden
in
search
of
you
they
tell
me
terrible
things
about
you
yes
said
hoddan
he
prepared
a
roll
for
biting
he
said
one
of
them
i
think
is
named
derec
he
to
identify
me
so
good
money
wasted
paying
for
the
wrong
man
the
other
man
police
is
he
he
reflected
a
moment
if
i
were
you
i
start
talking
at
a
million
credits
you
might
get
half
that
he
bit
into
the
roll
as
don
loris
looked
shocked
do
you
think
he
asked
indignantly
that
i
would
give
up
the
rescuer
of
my
daughter
to
emissaries
from
a
foreign
planet
to
be
locked
in
a
dungeon
for
life
not
in
those
words
conceded
hoddan
but
after
all
despite
your
deep
gratitude
to
me
there
are
such
things
as
one
duty
to
humanity
as
a
whole
and
while
it
would
cause
you
bitter
anguish
if
someone
dear
to
you
represented
a
danger
to
millions
of
innocent
women
and
children
still
under
such
circumstances
you
might
feel
it
necessary
to
do
violence
to
your
own
emotions
don
loris
looked
at
him
with
abrupt
suspicion
hoddan
waved
the
roll
moreover
he
observed
gratitude
for
actions
done
on
darth
does
not
entitle
you
to
judge
of
my
actions
on
walden
while
you
might
and
even
should
feel
obliged
to
defend
me
in
all
things
i
have
done
on
darth
your
obligation
to
me
does
not
let
you
deny
that
i
may
have
acted
less
defensibly
on
walden
don
loris
looked
extremely
uneasy
i
may
have
thought
something
like
that
he
admitted
but
so
that
said
hoddan
while
your
debt
to
me
can
not
and
should
not
be
overlooked
nevertheless
hoddan
put
the
roll
into
his
mouth
and
spoke
less
clearly
you
feel
that
you
should
give
consideration
to
the
claims
of
walden
to
inquire
into
my
actions
while
there
he
chewed
and
swallowed
and
said
gravely
and
can
i
make
deathrays
don
loris
brightened
he
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
he
said
complainingly
i
do
see
why
you
so
sarcastic
yes
that
is
a
rather
important
question
you
see
on
walden
they
do
know
how
to
they
say
you
do
they
very
anxious
that
nobody
should
be
able
to
but
while
in
unscrupulous
hands
such
an
instrument
of
destruction
would
be
most
unfortunate
ah
under
proper
control
yours
said
hoddan
say
ours
said
don
loris
hopefully
with
my
experience
of
men
and
affairs
and
my
loyal
and
devoted
retainers
and
cozy
dungeons
said
hoddan
he
wiped
his
mouth
no
don
loris
started
violently
no
what
no
deathrays
said
hoddan
i
ca
make
nobody
can
if
they
could
be
made
some
star
somewhere
would
be
turning
them
out
or
some
natural
phenomenon
would
let
them
loose
from
time
to
time
if
there
were
such
things
as
deathrays
all
living
things
would
have
died
or
else
would
have
adjusted
to
their
weaker
manifestations
and
developed
immunity
so
they
would
be
deathrays
any
longer
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
probably
been
the
case
some
time
in
the
past
so
far
as
the
gadget
goes
that
they
talking
about
it
been
in
use
for
half
a
century
in
the
cetis
cluster
nobody
died
of
it
yet
don
loris
looked
bitterly
disappointed
that
the
truth
he
asked
unhappily
honestly
that
your
last
word
on
it
much
said
hoddan
much
as
i
hate
to
spoil
the
prospects
of
profitable
skulduggery
that
my
last
word
and
it
true
but
those
men
from
walden
are
very
anxious
protested
don
loris
there
was
no
ship
available
so
their
government
got
a
liner
that
normally
would
stop
here
to
take
an
extra
lifeboat
aboard
it
came
out
of
overdrive
in
this
solar
system
let
out
the
lifeboat
and
went
on
its
way
again
those
two
men
are
extremely
anxious
ambitious
maybe
said
hoddan
they
prepared
to
pay
to
overcome
your
sense
of
gratitude
to
me
naturally
you
want
all
the
traffic
will
bear
i
think
you
can
get
half
a
million
don
loris
looked
suspicious
again
you
do
seem
worried
he
said
fretfully
i
do
understand
you
i
have
a
secret
said
hoddan
what
is
it
it
will
develop
said
hoddan
don
loris
hesitated
essayed
to
speak
and
thought
better
of
it
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
slowly
back
to
the
flight
of
stone
steps
he
descended
the
lady
fani
started
to
wring
her
hands
then
she
said
hopefully
what
your
secret
that
your
father
thinks
i
have
one
said
hoddan
thanks
for
the
breakfast
should
i
walk
out
the
gate
or
it
closed
said
the
lady
fani
forlornly
but
i
have
a
rope
for
you
you
can
go
down
over
the
wall
thanks
said
hoddan
it
been
a
pleasure
to
rescue
you
illustration
will
you
fani
hesitated
i
never
known
anybody
like
you
before
will
you
ever
come
back
hoddan
shook
his
head
at
her
once
you
asked
me
if
i
fight
for
you
and
look
what
it
got
me
into
no
commitments
he
glanced
along
the
battlements
there
was
a
fairly
large
coil
of
rope
in
view
he
picked
up
his
bag
and
went
over
to
it
he
checked
the
fastening
of
one
end
and
tumbled
the
other
over
the
wall
ten
minutes
later
he
trudged
up
to
thal
waiting
in
the
nearby
woodland
with
two
horses
the
lady
fani
he
said
has
the
kind
of
brains
i
like
she
pulled
up
the
rope
again
thal
did
not
comment
he
watched
morosely
as
hoddan
made
the
perpetually
present
ship
bag
fast
to
his
saddle
and
then
distastefully
climbed
aboard
the
horse
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
thal
unhappily
i
did
make
a
to
don
loris
so
i
be
disgraced
if
he
finds
out
i
helped
you
and
i
do
know
where
to
take
you
where
asked
hoddan
did
those
characters
from
walden
come
down
thal
told
him
at
the
castle
of
a
considerable
feudal
chieftain
on
the
plain
some
four
miles
from
the
mountain
range
and
six
miles
this
side
of
the
spaceport
we
ride
there
said
hoddan
liberty
is
said
to
be
sweet
but
the
man
who
said
that
did
have
blisters
from
a
saddle
let
go
they
rode
away
there
would
be
no
immediate
pursuit
and
possibly
none
at
all
don
loris
had
left
hoddan
at
breakfast
on
the
battlements
the
lady
fani
would
make
as
much
confusion
over
his
disappearance
as
she
could
but
there
be
no
search
for
him
until
don
loris
had
made
his
deal
hoddan
was
sure
that
fani
father
would
have
an
enjoyable
morning
he
would
relish
the
bargaining
session
he
explain
in
great
detail
how
valuable
had
been
hoddan
service
to
him
in
rescuing
fani
from
an
abductor
who
would
have
been
an
intolerable
he
grow
almost
tearful
as
he
described
his
affection
for
hoddan
how
he
loved
his
daughter
as
he
observed
grievedly
that
they
were
asking
him
to
betray
the
man
who
had
saved
for
him
the
solace
of
his
old
age
he
would
mention
also
that
the
price
they
offered
was
an
affront
to
his
paternal
affection
and
his
dignity
as
prince
of
this
baron
of
that
lord
of
the
other
thing
and
claimant
to
the
dukedom
of
either
they
come
up
or
the
deal
was
off
but
meanwhile
hoddan
and
thal
rode
industriously
toward
the
place
from
which
those
emissaries
had
come
all
was
tranquil
all
was
calm
once
they
saw
a
dust
cloud
and
thal
turned
aside
to
a
providential
wooded
copse
in
which
they
remained
while
a
cavalcade
went
by
thal
explained
that
it
was
a
feudal
chieftain
on
his
way
to
the
spaceport
town
it
was
simple
discretion
for
them
not
to
be
observed
said
thal
because
they
had
great
reputations
as
fighting
men
whoever
defeated
them
would
become
prominent
at
once
so
somebody
might
try
to
pick
a
quarrel
under
one
of
the
finer
points
of
etiquette
when
it
would
be
disgrace
to
use
anything
but
standard
darthian
implements
for
massacre
hoddan
admitted
that
he
did
not
feel
quarrelsome
they
rode
on
after
a
time
and
in
late
afternoon
the
towers
and
battlements
of
the
castle
they
sought
appeared
the
ground
here
was
only
gently
rolling
they
approached
it
with
caution
following
the
reverse
slope
of
hills
and
dry
and
at
last
penetrating
brush
to
the
point
where
they
could
see
it
clearly
if
hoddan
had
been
a
student
of
early
terrestrial
history
he
might
have
remarked
upon
the
of
ancient
architectural
forms
to
match
the
revival
of
primitive
social
systems
as
it
was
he
noted
in
this
feudal
castle
the
use
of
bastions
for
flanking
fire
upon
attackers
he
recognized
the
value
of
battlements
for
the
protection
of
defenders
while
allowing
them
to
shoot
and
the
tricky
positioning
of
sally
ports
he
even
grasped
the
reason
for
the
massive
stark
unornamented
keep
but
his
eyes
did
not
stay
on
the
castle
for
long
he
saw
the
spaceboat
in
which
derec
and
his
more
authoritative
companion
had
arrived
it
lay
on
the
ground
a
half
mile
from
the
castle
walls
it
was
a
clumsy
obese
flattened
shape
some
forty
feet
long
and
nearly
fifteen
wide
the
ground
about
it
was
scorched
where
it
had
descended
upon
its
rocket
flames
there
were
several
horses
tethered
near
it
and
men
who
were
plainly
retainers
of
the
nearby
castle
reposed
in
its
shade
hoddan
reined
in
here
we
part
he
told
thal
when
we
first
met
i
enabled
you
to
pick
the
pockets
of
a
good
many
of
your
i
never
asked
for
my
split
of
the
take
i
expect
you
to
remember
me
with
affection
thal
clasped
both
of
hoddan
hands
in
his
if
you
ever
return
he
said
with
mournful
warmth
i
am
your
friend
hoddan
nodded
and
rode
out
of
the
brushwood
toward
the
spaceboat
the
lifeboat
that
had
landed
the
emissaries
from
walden
that
it
landed
so
close
to
the
spaceport
of
course
was
no
accident
it
was
known
on
walden
that
hoddan
had
taken
space
passage
to
darth
he
have
landed
only
two
days
before
his
pursuers
could
reach
the
planet
and
on
a
roadless
primitive
world
like
darth
he
could
have
gotten
far
from
the
spaceport
so
his
pursuers
would
have
landed
close
by
also
but
it
must
have
taken
considerable
courage
when
the
landing
grid
failed
to
answer
it
must
have
seemed
likely
that
hoddan
deathrays
had
been
at
work
here
and
now
though
there
was
no
uneasiness
hoddan
rode
heavily
without
haste
through
the
slanting
sunshine
he
was
seen
from
a
distance
and
watched
without
apprehension
by
the
loafing
guards
about
the
boat
he
looked
hot
and
thirsty
he
was
both
so
the
posted
guard
merely
looked
at
him
without
too
much
interest
when
he
brought
his
dusty
mount
up
to
the
shadow
the
lifeboat
cast
and
apparently
decided
that
there
was
room
to
get
into
it
he
grunted
a
greeting
and
looked
at
them
speculatively
those
two
characters
from
walden
he
observed
sent
me
to
get
something
from
this
thing
here
don
loris
told
i
was
a
very
honest
man
he
painstakingly
looked
like
a
very
honest
man
after
a
moment
there
were
responsive
grins
if
there
anything
missing
when
i
start
back
said
hoddan
i
imagine
how
it
happened
none
of
you
would
take
anything
oh
no
i
bet
you
blame
it
on
me
he
shook
his
head
and
said
tsk
one
of
the
guards
sat
up
and
said
appreciatively
but
it
locked
good
being
an
honest
man
said
hoddan
amiably
they
told
me
how
to
unlock
it
he
got
off
his
horse
he
removed
the
bag
from
his
saddle
he
went
into
the
grateful
shadow
of
the
metal
hull
he
paused
and
mopped
his
face
and
then
went
to
the
entrance
port
he
put
his
hand
on
the
turning
bar
then
he
painstakingly
pushed
in
the
with
his
other
hand
of
course
the
handle
turned
the
boat
port
opened
the
two
from
walden
would
have
thought
everything
safe
because
it
was
under
guard
on
walden
that
protection
would
have
been
enough
on
darth
the
spaceboat
had
not
been
looted
simply
because
locks
there
were
not
made
with
separate
to
keep
vibration
from
loosening
them
on
spaceboats
such
a
precaution
was
usual
give
me
two
minutes
said
hoddan
over
his
shoulder
i
have
to
get
what
they
sent
me
for
after
that
everybody
starts
even
he
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
then
he
locked
it
by
the
nature
of
things
it
is
as
needful
to
be
able
to
lock
a
spaceboat
from
the
inside
as
it
is
unnecessary
to
lock
it
from
without
he
looked
things
over
standard
equipment
everywhere
he
checked
everything
even
to
the
fuel
supply
there
were
knockings
on
the
port
he
continued
to
inspect
he
turned
on
the
visionscreens
which
provided
the
control
room
indeed
all
the
boat
with
an
unobstructed
view
in
all
directions
he
was
satisfied
the
knocks
became
bangings
something
approaching
indignation
could
be
deduced
the
guards
around
the
spaceboat
felt
that
hoddan
was
taking
an
unfair
amount
of
time
to
pick
the
cream
of
the
loot
inside
he
got
a
glass
of
water
it
was
excellent
a
second
the
bangings
became
violent
hammerings
hoddan
seated
himself
leisurely
in
the
pilot
seat
and
turned
small
knobs
he
waited
he
touched
a
button
there
was
a
mildly
thunderous
bang
outside
and
the
lifeboat
reacted
as
if
to
a
slight
shock
the
visionscreens
showed
a
cloud
of
dust
at
the
spaceboat
stern
roused
by
a
deliberate
explosion
in
the
rocket
tubes
it
also
showed
the
retainers
in
full
flight
he
waited
until
they
were
in
safety
and
made
the
standard
preparations
a
horrific
roaring
started
up
outside
he
touched
controls
and
a
monstrous
weight
pushed
him
back
in
his
seat
the
rocket
swung
and
lifted
and
shot
skyward
with
greater
acceleration
than
before
it
went
up
at
a
lifeboat
full
rate
of
climb
leaving
a
trail
of
flame
behind
it
all
the
surface
of
darth
seemed
to
contract
swiftly
below
him
the
spaceport
and
the
town
rushed
toward
a
spot
beneath
the
spaceboat
tail
they
shrank
and
shrank
he
saw
other
places
mountains
castles
he
saw
don
loris
stronghold
higher
he
saw
the
sea
the
sky
turned
purple
it
went
black
with
specks
of
starshine
in
it
hoddan
swung
to
a
westward
course
and
continued
to
rise
watching
the
as
they
shifted
on
the
screens
the
image
of
the
sun
of
course
was
automatically
diminished
so
that
it
was
not
dazzling
the
rockets
continued
to
roar
though
in
a
minor
fashion
because
there
was
no
longer
air
outside
in
which
a
bellow
could
develop
hoddan
painstakingly
made
use
of
those
methods
of
astrogation
which
his
piratical
forebears
had
developed
and
which
a
boy
on
zan
absorbed
without
being
aware
he
wanted
an
orbit
around
darth
he
did
want
to
take
time
to
try
to
compute
it
so
he
watched
the
ahead
and
astern
if
the
stars
ahead
rose
above
the
edge
faster
than
those
behind
sank
down
below
it
he
would
be
climbing
if
the
stars
behind
sank
down
faster
than
those
ahead
rose
up
he
would
be
descending
if
all
the
stars
rose
equally
he
be
climbing
straight
up
and
if
they
all
dropped
equally
he
be
moving
straight
down
it
was
not
a
complex
method
and
it
worked
presently
he
relaxed
he
sped
swiftly
back
past
midday
and
toward
the
sunrise
line
on
darth
this
was
the
reverse
of
a
normal
orbit
but
it
was
the
direction
followed
by
the
ships
up
here
he
hoped
his
orbit
was
lower
than
theirs
if
it
was
he
overtake
them
from
behind
if
he
were
higher
they
overtake
him
he
turned
on
the
space
phone
its
was
piously
placed
at
ground
he
shifted
it
to
space
so
that
it
would
pick
up
calls
going
planetward
instead
of
listening
vainly
for
replies
from
the
nonoperative
landing
grid
instantly
voices
boomed
in
his
ears
many
voices
an
impossibly
large
number
of
voices
many
many
many
more
than
nine
transmitters
were
in
operation
now
said
a
voice
in
quiet
passion
off
or
you
get
in
our
a
voice
said
and
group
two
take
position
somebody
bellowed
why
do
they
answer
and
another
voice
still
said
formally
group
five
but
four
ships
are
staying
behind
with
toya
is
having
stabilizer
trouble
hoddan
eyes
opened
very
wide
he
turned
down
the
sound
while
he
tried
to
think
but
there
was
anything
to
think
he
come
aloft
to
scout
three
ships
that
had
turned
to
nine
because
he
was
in
such
a
fix
on
darth
that
anything
strange
might
be
changed
into
something
useful
but
this
was
more
than
nine
ships
itself
an
impossibly
large
space
fleet
there
was
no
reason
why
ships
of
space
should
ever
travel
together
there
were
innumerable
reasons
why
they
should
there
was
a
limit
to
the
number
of
ships
that
could
be
accommodated
at
any
spaceport
in
the
galaxy
there
was
no
point
no
profit
no
purpose
in
a
number
of
ships
traveling
together
darth
appeared
far
ahead
the
lifeboat
would
soon
cease
to
be
a
bright
light
in
the
sky
now
the
sun
image
vanished
from
the
rear
screens
the
boat
went
hurtling
onward
through
the
blackness
of
the
planet
shadow
while
voices
squabbled
and
wrangled
and
formally
reported
and
now
and
again
one
admonished
disputants
to
a
proper
discipline
of
language
during
the
period
of
darkness
hoddan
racked
his
brains
for
the
vaguest
of
ideas
on
why
so
many
ships
should
appear
about
an
obscure
and
unimportant
world
like
darth
presently
the
sunset
line
appeared
ahead
and
far
away
he
saw
moving
lights
which
were
the
hulls
of
the
volubly
communicating
vessels
he
stared
blankly
there
were
tens
scores
he
was
forced
to
guess
at
the
stark
impossibility
of
more
than
a
hundred
spacecraft
in
view
as
the
boat
rushed
onward
he
had
to
raise
the
guess
it
could
be
but
he
turned
on
the
outside
telescope
and
the
image
on
its
screen
was
more
incredible
than
the
voices
and
the
existence
of
the
fleet
itself
the
scope
focused
first
on
a
bulging
monster
antiquated
freighter
of
a
design
that
had
not
been
built
for
a
hundred
years
the
second
view
was
of
a
passenger
liner
with
the
elaborate
ornamentation
that
in
past
generations
was
considered
suitable
for
space
there
was
a
ship
with
no
emergency
rockets
at
all
and
crews
quarters
in
long
blisters
built
outside
the
gigantic
tank
which
was
the
ship
itself
there
was
a
space
yacht
more
freighters
with
streaks
of
rust
on
their
sides
where
they
had
lain
aground
for
tens
of
years
the
fleet
was
an
anomaly
and
each
of
its
component
parts
was
separately
a
freak
it
was
a
of
all
the
outmoded
and
obsolete
hulks
and
monstrosities
of
space
one
would
have
to
scavenge
half
the
galaxy
to
bring
together
so
many
crazy
derelicts
that
should
have
been
in
junk
yards
then
hoddan
drew
an
explosive
deep
breath
it
was
suddenly
clear
what
the
fleet
was
and
what
its
reason
must
be
why
it
stopped
here
could
not
yet
be
guessed
but
hoddan
watched
absorbedly
he
could
know
what
was
toward
but
there
was
some
emergency
it
could
be
in
the
line
of
what
an
electronic
engineer
could
handle
if
so
why
it
could
mean
an
opportunity
to
accomplish
great
things
and
grow
rich
and
probably
marry
some
delightful
girl
and
be
a
great
man
somewhere
an
assortment
of
ambitions
one
could
not
easily
gratify
on
zan
or
walden
or
darth
vii
the
spaceboat
floated
on
upon
a
with
the
arriving
fleet
that
would
not
mean
of
course
actual
contact
with
any
of
the
improbable
vessels
themselves
crowded
as
the
sunlit
specks
might
seem
from
darth
shadow
they
were
sufficiently
separated
it
was
more
than
likely
that
even
with
intervals
the
ships
would
be
considered
much
too
crowded
but
they
came
pouring
out
of
emptiness
to
go
into
a
swirling
plainly
orbit
about
the
planet
from
which
hoddan
had
risen
less
than
an
hour
before
there
was
inevitable
confusion
though
and
the
spacephone
proved
it
there
were
disputes
between
freakish
ships
when
craft
with
the
astrogational
qualities
of
washtubs
tried
to
keep
assigned
positions
and
failed
and
there
were
squabbles
when
ships
had
to
pass
close
together
one
had
to
shut
off
its
to
keep
from
blowing
the
fuses
of
both
but
there
were
some
ships
which
proceeded
quietly
to
their
positions
and
others
which
did
the
same
after
tumult
amounting
to
rebellion
and
naturally
there
were
a
few
others
which
seemed
incapable
of
with
anybody
they
went
careening
through
the
other
ships
paths
in
what
must
have
seemed
to
the
planet
sunset
area
like
a
most
unlikely
dancing
of
stars
it
was
a
gigantic
traffic
tangle
and
hoddan
boat
drifted
toward
and
into
it
he
counted
a
hundred
ships
long
before
his
count
now
passed
two
hundred
and
continued
before
he
gave
up
he
numbered
two
hundred
swarming
to
make
a
whirling
band
a
ring
around
the
planet
darth
he
was
fairly
sure
that
he
knew
what
they
were
now
but
he
could
not
possibly
guess
where
they
came
from
and
most
mysterious
of
all
was
the
question
of
why
they
come
out
of
drive
to
make
of
themselves
a
celestial
feature
about
a
planet
which
had
practically
nothing
to
offer
to
anybody
presently
the
spaceboat
was
in
the
very
thick
of
the
fleet
his
communicator
spouted
voices
whose
tones
ranged
from
basso
profundo
to
high
tenor
and
whose
ideas
of
proper
astrogation
seemed
to
vary
more
widely
still
there
boomed
a
voice
with
deafening
volume
in
our
sheer
off
the
volume
of
a
signal
in
space
varies
as
the
square
of
the
distance
this
voice
was
thunderous
it
came
apparently
from
a
nearby
tripper
ship
of
really
ancient
vintage
rows
of
ports
in
its
sides
had
been
welded
over
it
had
rocket
tubes
whose
size
was
indicative
of
the
kind
of
fuel
on
which
it
once
had
operated
slenderer
nozzles
peered
out
of
the
original
ones
now
it
had
been
adapted
to
modern
propellants
by
simply
welding
modern
rockets
inside
the
old
ones
it
was
only
half
a
mile
away
hoddan
spaceboat
floated
on
the
relative
position
of
the
two
ships
changed
slowly
another
voice
said
indignantly
the
same
thing
that
missed
us
by
less
than
a
mile
you
there
stop
acting
like
a
squig
get
on
your
own
course
a
third
voice
boat
that
i
do
recognize
it
i
thought
i
knew
all
the
freaks
in
this
fleet
too
a
fourth
voice
said
sharply
not
one
of
us
look
at
the
design
that
not
us
other
voices
broke
in
there
was
babbling
then
a
harsh
voice
roared
i
order
it
there
was
silence
the
harsh
voice
said
heavily
the
image
to
there
was
a
pause
the
same
voice
said
grimly
is
not
of
our
fleet
you
stranger
identify
yourself
who
are
you
and
why
do
you
slip
secretly
among
us
hoddan
pushed
the
transmit
button
my
name
is
bron
hoddan
he
said
i
came
up
to
find
out
why
three
ships
and
then
nine
ships
went
into
orbit
around
darth
it
was
somewhat
alarming
our
landing
grid
disabled
anyhow
and
it
seemed
wisest
to
look
you
over
before
we
communicated
and
possibly
told
you
something
you
might
not
believe
but
you
surely
do
expect
to
land
all
this
fleet
actually
we
ca
land
any
the
harsh
voice
said
as
grimly
as
before
come
from
the
planet
below
us
darth
why
is
your
ship
so
small
the
smallest
of
ours
is
this
is
a
lifeboat
said
hoddan
pleasantly
it
supposed
to
be
carried
on
larger
ships
in
case
of
emergency
you
will
come
to
our
leading
said
the
voice
will
answer
all
your
questions
i
will
have
a
smoke
flare
set
off
to
guide
hoddan
said
to
himself
no
threats
and
no
offers
i
can
guess
why
there
are
no
threats
but
they
should
offer
something
he
waited
there
was
a
sudden
huge
eruption
of
vapor
in
space
some
two
hundred
miles
away
perhaps
an
ounce
of
explosive
had
been
introduced
into
a
rocket
tube
and
fired
the
smoke
particles
naturally
ionized
added
their
to
the
expansiveness
of
the
gases
a
cauliflowerlike
shape
of
filmy
whiteness
appeared
and
grew
larger
and
thinner
hoddan
drove
toward
the
spot
with
very
light
touches
of
rocket
power
he
swung
the
boat
around
and
killed
its
relative
velocity
the
leading
ship
was
a
sort
of
gigantic
shapeless
utterly
preposterous
thing
hoddan
could
neither
imagine
a
purpose
for
which
it
could
have
been
used
nor
a
time
when
men
would
have
built
anything
like
it
its
huge
sides
seemed
to
be
made
exclusively
of
great
doorways
now
tightly
closed
one
of
those
doorways
suddenly
gaped
wide
it
would
have
admitted
a
modern
ship
a
nervous
voice
essayed
to
give
hoddan
directions
for
getting
the
spaceboat
inside
what
was
plainly
an
enormous
hold
now
pumped
empty
of
air
he
grunted
and
made
the
attempt
it
was
tricky
he
sweated
when
he
cut
off
his
power
but
he
felt
fairly
safe
rocket
flames
would
burn
down
such
a
door
if
necessary
he
could
work
havoc
if
hostilities
began
the
great
cargo
door
swung
shut
the
needle
swung
sharply
and
stopped
at
thirty
centimeters
of
mercury
pressure
there
was
a
clanging
a
smaller
door
evidently
opened
somewhere
lights
came
on
glow
tubes
then
figures
appeared
through
a
door
leading
to
some
other
part
of
this
ship
hoddan
nodded
to
himself
the
costume
was
odd
it
was
awkward
it
was
even
primitive
but
not
in
the
fashion
of
the
soiled
but
gaudily
colored
garments
of
darth
these
men
wore
unrelieved
black
with
gray
shirts
there
was
no
touch
of
color
about
them
even
the
younger
ones
wore
beards
and
of
all
unnecessary
things
they
wore
hats
in
a
spaceship
hoddan
opened
the
boat
door
and
said
politely
good
morning
i
bron
hoddan
you
were
talking
to
me
just
now
the
oldest
and
most
fiercely
bearded
of
the
men
said
harshly
i
am
the
leader
here
we
are
the
people
of
colin
he
frowned
when
hoddan
expression
remained
unchanged
the
people
of
colin
he
repeated
more
loudly
the
people
whose
forefathers
settled
that
planet
and
brought
it
to
be
a
world
of
peace
and
plenty
and
then
foolishly
welcomed
strangers
to
their
midst
too
bad
said
hoddan
he
knew
what
these
people
were
doing
he
believed
but
putting
a
name
to
where
they
come
from
told
him
nothing
of
what
they
wanted
of
darth
we
made
it
a
fair
world
said
the
bearded
man
fiercely
but
it
was
my
who
destroyed
it
he
believed
that
we
should
share
it
it
was
he
who
persuaded
the
synod
to
allow
strangers
to
settle
among
us
believing
that
they
would
become
like
us
hoddan
nodded
expectantly
these
people
were
in
some
sort
of
trouble
or
they
would
have
come
out
of
overdrive
but
they
talked
about
it
until
it
had
become
an
emotionalized
obsession
that
could
be
summarized
when
they
encountered
a
stranger
they
had
to
picture
their
predicament
passionately
and
at
length
this
bearded
man
looked
at
hoddan
with
burning
eyes
when
he
went
on
it
was
with
gestures
as
if
he
were
making
a
speech
but
it
was
a
special
sort
of
speech
the
first
sentence
told
what
kind
they
clung
to
their
sins
said
the
bearded
man
bitterly
they
did
not
adopt
our
ways
our
example
went
for
naught
they
brought
others
of
their
kind
to
colin
after
a
little
they
laughed
at
us
in
a
little
more
they
outnumbered
us
then
they
ruled
that
the
laws
of
our
synod
should
not
govern
them
and
they
lured
our
young
people
to
imitate
them
frivolous
sinful
riotous
folk
that
they
were
hoddan
nodded
again
there
were
elderly
people
on
zan
who
talked
like
this
not
his
grandfather
if
you
listened
long
enough
they
come
to
some
point
or
other
but
they
had
arranged
their
thoughts
so
solidly
that
any
attempt
to
get
quickly
at
their
meaning
would
only
produce
confusion
twenty
years
since
said
the
bearded
man
with
an
angry
gesture
we
made
a
bargain
we
held
a
third
of
all
the
land
of
the
planet
but
our
young
men
were
falling
away
from
the
ways
of
their
fathers
we
made
a
bargain
with
the
newcomers
we
had
cherished
we
would
trade
our
lands
our
cities
our
farms
our
highways
for
ships
to
take
us
to
a
new
world
with
food
for
the
journey
and
machines
for
the
taming
of
the
planet
we
would
select
we
sent
of
our
number
to
find
a
world
to
which
we
could
move
ten
years
back
they
returned
they
had
found
it
the
planet
thetis
again
hoddan
had
no
reaction
the
name
meant
nothing
we
began
to
prepare
said
the
old
man
his
eyes
flashing
five
years
since
we
were
ready
but
we
had
to
wait
three
more
before
the
bargainers
were
ready
to
complete
the
trade
they
had
to
buy
and
collect
the
ships
they
had
to
design
and
build
the
machinery
we
would
need
they
had
to
collect
the
food
supplies
two
years
ago
we
moved
our
animals
into
the
ships
and
loaded
our
food
and
our
furnishings
and
took
our
places
we
set
out
for
two
years
we
have
journeyed
toward
thetis
hoddan
felt
an
instinctive
respect
for
people
who
would
undertake
to
move
themselves
the
third
of
the
population
of
a
planet
over
a
distance
that
meant
years
of
voyaging
they
might
have
tastes
in
costume
that
he
did
not
share
and
they
might
go
in
for
elaborate
oratory
instead
of
statements
but
they
had
courage
yes
sir
said
hoddan
i
take
it
this
brings
us
up
to
the
present
no
said
the
old
man
his
eyes
flashing
six
months
ago
we
considered
that
we
might
well
begin
to
train
the
operators
of
the
machines
we
would
use
on
thetis
we
uncrated
machines
we
found
ourselves
cheated
illustration
hoddan
found
that
he
could
make
a
fairly
dispassionate
guess
of
what
advantage
say
nedda
father
would
take
of
people
who
would
not
check
on
his
good
faith
for
two
years
and
until
they
were
two
years
journey
away
the
business
men
on
krim
would
have
some
sort
of
code
determining
how
completely
one
could
swindle
a
customer
don
loris
now
how
badly
were
you
cheated
asked
hoddan
of
our
lives
said
the
angry
old
man
do
you
know
machinery
some
kinds
admitted
hoddan
come
said
the
leader
of
the
fleet
with
a
sort
of
dignity
that
was
theatrical
only
because
he
was
aware
of
it
the
leader
of
the
people
of
colin
showed
the
way
hoddan
had
been
admitted
with
his
spaceboat
into
one
gigantic
cargo
hold
he
was
now
escorted
to
the
next
it
was
packed
tightly
with
cases
of
machinery
one
huge
crate
had
been
opened
and
its
contents
fully
disclosed
others
had
been
hacked
at
enough
to
show
their
contents
the
uncrated
machine
was
a
jungle
plow
it
was
a
powerful
piece
of
equipment
which
would
attack
jungle
on
a
front
knock
down
all
vegetation
up
to
trees
of
diameter
shred
it
loosen
and
sift
the
soil
to
a
depth
and
leave
behind
it
smoothed
broken
pulverized
dirt
mixed
with
vegetation
ready
to
break
down
into
humus
such
a
machine
would
clear
tens
of
acres
in
a
day
and
night
turning
jungle
into
farmland
ready
for
terrestrial
crops
we
ran
this
for
five
minutes
said
the
bearded
man
fiercely
as
hoddan
nodded
approval
he
lifted
a
motor
hood
the
motors
were
burned
out
worthless
insulation
gears
were
splintered
and
smashed
metal
castings
assembly
bolts
had
parted
tractor
treads
were
bent
and
cracked
it
was
not
a
machine
except
in
shape
it
was
a
in
worthless
materials
which
probably
cost
its
maker
the
twentieth
part
of
what
an
honest
jungle
plow
would
cost
to
build
hoddan
felt
the
anger
any
man
feels
when
he
sees
betrayal
of
that
honor
a
competent
machine
represents
it
not
all
like
this
he
said
incredulously
some
is
worse
said
the
old
man
with
dignity
there
are
crates
which
are
marked
to
contain
turbines
their
contents
are
ancient
machines
there
are
crates
marked
to
contain
generators
they
are
filled
with
corroded
irrigation
pipe
and
broken
castings
we
have
shiploads
of
rusted
trimmings
we
have
been
cheated
of
our
lives
hoddan
found
himself
sick
with
honest
fury
the
population
of
of
a
planet
packed
into
spaceships
for
two
years
and
more
would
be
appropriate
subjects
for
sympathy
at
the
best
of
times
but
it
was
only
accident
that
had
kept
these
people
from
landing
on
thetis
by
rocket
since
none
of
their
ships
would
be
expected
ever
to
rise
again
and
from
having
their
men
go
out
and
joyfully
hack
at
an
alien
jungle
to
make
room
for
their
machines
to
land
and
then
find
out
brought
scrap
metal
for
some
thousands
of
to
no
purpose
they
have
starved
outright
in
fact
they
were
in
not
much
better
case
right
now
because
there
was
nowhere
else
that
they
could
go
there
was
no
new
colony
which
could
absorb
so
many
people
with
only
their
bare
hands
for
equipment
to
live
by
there
was
no
civilized
settled
world
which
could
admit
so
many
paupers
without
starving
its
own
population
there
was
nowhere
for
these
people
to
go
hoddan
anger
took
on
the
feeling
of
guilt
he
could
do
nothing
and
something
had
to
be
done
why
why
did
you
come
to
darth
he
asked
what
can
you
gain
by
orbiting
here
you
ca
expect
the
old
man
faced
him
we
are
beggars
he
said
with
bitter
dignity
we
stopped
here
to
ask
for
charity
for
the
old
and
machines
the
people
of
darth
can
spare
us
we
will
be
grateful
for
even
a
single
rusty
plow
because
we
have
to
go
on
we
can
do
nothing
else
we
will
land
on
thetis
and
one
plow
can
mean
that
a
few
of
us
will
live
who
otherwise
would
die
with
with
the
most
of
us
hoddan
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
this
was
not
his
trouble
but
he
could
not
thrust
it
from
him
but
again
why
darth
he
asked
helplessly
why
not
stop
at
a
world
with
riches
to
spare
darth
a
poor
place
because
it
is
the
poor
who
are
generous
said
the
bearded
man
evenly
the
rich
might
give
us
what
they
could
spare
but
simple
people
close
to
the
soil
will
give
us
what
they
need
themselves
they
will
share
what
they
have
and
accept
a
share
of
our
need
hoddan
paced
up
and
down
the
ancient
flooring
of
this
compartment
in
an
ancient
ship
presently
he
said
jerkily
with
all
the
good
will
in
the
world
darth
is
it
has
no
industries
it
has
no
technology
it
has
not
even
roads
it
is
a
planet
of
little
villages
and
tiny
towns
a
ship
from
elsewhere
stops
here
only
once
a
month
ground
communications
are
almost
nonexistent
to
spread
the
word
of
your
need
over
darth
would
require
months
but
to
collect
what
might
be
given
without
roads
or
even
wheeled
vehicles
no
it
impossible
and
i
have
the
only
space
vessel
on
the
planet
and
it
not
fit
for
a
journey
between
suns
the
bearded
man
waited
with
a
sort
of
implacable
despair
but
said
hoddan
grimly
i
have
an
idea
i
ah
have
contacts
on
walden
the
government
of
walden
does
not
regard
charity
with
favor
the
need
for
charity
seems
a
ah
a
criticism
of
the
waldenian
standard
of
living
the
bearded
man
said
coldly
i
can
understand
that
the
hearts
of
the
rich
are
hardened
the
existence
of
the
poor
is
a
reproach
to
them
but
hoddan
began
suddenly
to
see
real
possibilities
this
was
not
a
direct
move
toward
the
realization
of
his
personal
ambitions
but
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
movement
away
from
them
hoddan
suddenly
remembered
an
oration
he
heard
his
grandfather
give
many
many
times
in
the
past
straight
thinkin
the
old
man
had
said
obstinately
is
a
delusion
you
think
things
out
clear
and
simple
and
you
can
see
yourself
ruined
and
your
family
starving
any
day
but
real
things
ai
simple
they
ai
clear
any
time
you
try
to
figure
things
out
so
they
simple
and
straightforward
you
goin
against
nature
and
you
going
to
get
mixed
up
so
when
something
happens
and
you
in
a
straightforward
hopeless
fix
why
you
go
along
with
nature
make
it
as
complicated
as
you
can
and
the
people
who
want
you
in
trouble
will
get
hopeless
confused
and
you
can
get
out
hoddan
adverted
to
his
grandfather
wisdom
not
making
it
the
reason
for
doing
what
he
could
but
accepting
that
it
not
impossibly
might
apply
he
saw
one
possibility
right
away
it
looked
fairly
good
after
a
minute
examination
it
looked
better
it
was
astonishing
how
plausible
he
said
i
have
planned
work
of
my
own
as
you
may
have
guessed
i
am
here
because
of
ah
people
on
walden
if
i
could
make
a
quick
trip
to
walden
my
present
position
might
let
me
help
you
i
can
not
promise
very
much
but
if
i
can
borrow
even
the
smallest
of
your
ships
for
the
journey
my
spaceboat
ca
make
why
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
much
more
than
can
be
done
on
darth
the
bearded
man
looked
at
his
companions
he
seems
frank
he
said
forbiddingly
and
we
can
lose
nothing
we
have
stopped
our
journey
and
are
in
orbit
we
can
wait
but
our
people
should
not
go
to
walden
fleshpots
i
can
find
a
crew
said
hoddan
cheerfully
inwardly
he
was
tremendously
relieved
if
you
say
the
word
i
go
down
to
ground
and
come
back
with
them
er
i
want
a
very
small
ship
it
will
be
said
the
old
man
we
thank
you
get
it
inboard
here
suggested
hoddan
so
i
can
come
inside
as
before
transfer
my
crew
without
spacesuits
and
leave
my
boat
in
your
care
until
i
come
back
it
shall
be
done
said
the
old
man
firmly
he
added
gravely
you
must
have
had
an
excellent
upbringing
young
man
to
be
willing
to
live
among
the
people
you
describe
and
to
be
willing
to
go
so
far
to
help
strangers
like
ourselves
eh
then
hoddan
said
enigmatically
what
lessons
i
shall
apply
to
your
affairs
i
learned
at
the
knee
of
my
beloved
grandfather
of
course
his
grandfather
was
head
of
the
most
notorious
gang
of
pirates
on
the
disreputable
planet
zan
but
hoddan
found
himself
increasingly
respecting
the
old
gentleman
as
he
gained
experience
of
various
worlds
he
went
briskly
back
to
his
spaceboat
on
the
way
he
made
verbal
arrangements
for
the
enterprise
he
envisioned
so
swiftly
it
was
remarkable
how
two
sets
of
troubles
could
provide
suggestions
for
their
joint
alleviation
he
actually
saw
possible
achievement
before
him
even
in
electronics
by
the
time
the
cargo
space
was
again
pumped
empty
and
the
great
door
opened
to
the
vastness
of
space
hoddan
had
a
very
broad
view
of
things
he
said
that
same
day
to
fani
that
a
practical
man
can
always
make
what
he
wants
to
do
look
like
a
sacrifice
of
his
personal
inclinations
to
others
welfare
he
began
to
suspect
now
that
the
welfare
of
others
can
often
coincide
with
one
own
he
needed
some
rather
extensive
changes
in
the
relationship
of
the
cosmos
to
himself
walden
was
prepared
to
pay
bribes
for
him
don
loris
felt
it
necessary
to
have
him
confined
somewhere
there
were
a
number
of
darthian
gentlemen
who
would
assuredly
like
to
slaughter
him
if
he
was
kept
out
of
their
reach
in
some
cozy
dungeon
but
up
to
now
there
had
been
not
even
a
practical
way
to
leave
darth
to
act
upon
walden
or
even
to
change
his
status
in
the
eyes
of
darthians
he
backed
out
of
the
big
ship
and
consulted
the
charts
of
the
lifeboat
they
had
been
consulted
before
of
course
to
locate
the
landing
grid
which
did
not
answer
calls
he
found
its
position
he
began
to
compare
the
chart
with
what
he
saw
from
out
here
in
orbit
above
darth
he
identified
a
small
ocean
with
darth
highest
mountain
chain
just
beyond
its
eastern
limit
he
identified
a
emptying
into
that
sea
and
here
he
began
to
get
rid
of
his
excess
velocity
because
the
landing
grid
was
not
very
far
distant
some
fifteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
miles
to
a
scientific
pilot
his
maneuvering
from
that
time
on
would
have
been
a
complex
task
the
advantage
of
computation
over
astrogation
by
ear
however
is
largely
a
matter
of
saving
fuel
a
perfectly
computed
course
for
landing
will
get
down
to
ground
with
the
use
of
the
least
number
of
centigrams
of
fuel
possible
but
maneuvers
are
rarely
ones
hoddan
had
the
time
or
the
data
for
computation
he
swung
the
spaceboat
end
for
end
very
judgmatically
used
rocket
power
to
slow
himself
to
a
suitable
velocity
and
at
the
last
and
proper
instant
applied
for
deceleration
and
went
down
practically
like
a
stone
one
can
not
really
learn
this
it
has
to
be
absorbed
through
the
pores
of
one
skin
that
was
the
way
hoddan
had
absorbed
it
on
zan
within
minutes
then
the
stronghold
of
don
loris
was
startled
by
a
roaring
mutter
in
the
sky
high
overhead
helmeted
sentries
on
the
battlements
stared
upward
the
mutter
rose
to
a
howl
and
the
howl
to
the
volume
of
thunder
and
the
thunder
to
a
very
great
noise
which
made
loose
pebbles
dance
and
quiver
then
there
was
a
speck
of
white
cloudiness
in
the
late
afternoon
sky
it
grew
swiftly
in
size
and
a
winking
light
appeared
in
its
center
that
light
grew
brighter
and
the
noise
managed
somehow
to
increase
and
presently
the
ruddy
sunlight
was
diluted
by
light
from
the
rockets
with
considerably
more
blue
in
it
secondary
pallid
shadows
appeared
then
abruptly
the
rockets
cut
off
and
something
dark
plunged
downward
and
the
rockets
flamed
again
and
a
vast
mass
of
steam
arose
from
scorched
ground
and
the
spaceboat
lay
in
a
circle
of
wildly
smoking
carbonized
darthian
soil
the
return
of
tranquility
after
so
much
of
tumult
was
startling
absolutely
nothing
happened
hoddan
unstrapped
himself
from
the
seat
examined
his
surroundings
thoughtfully
and
turned
off
the
vision
apparatus
he
went
back
and
examined
the
feeding
arrangements
of
the
boat
he
had
nothing
to
eat
since
breakfast
in
this
same
the
food
in
store
was
extremely
easy
to
prepare
and
not
especially
appetizing
he
ate
with
great
deliberation
continuing
to
make
plans
which
linked
the
necessities
of
the
emigrants
from
colin
to
his
relationship
to
the
government
of
walden
the
brief
visit
he
made
to
krim
the
ship
the
emigrants
would
lend
him
and
his
unpopularity
with
don
loris
on
darth
he
also
thought
very
respectfully
about
his
grandfather
opinions
on
many
subjects
including
hoddan
found
himself
much
more
in
agreement
with
his
grandfather
than
believed
possible
outside
the
boat
birds
which
had
dived
to
ground
and
cowered
there
during
the
boat
descent
now
flew
about
again
their
terror
forgotten
horses
which
had
galloped
wildly
in
their
pastures
or
kicked
in
panic
in
the
castle
stalls
returned
to
their
oats
and
hay
and
there
were
human
reactions
don
loris
had
been
in
an
excessively
fretful
state
of
mind
since
the
conclusion
of
his
deal
with
the
pair
from
walden
hoddan
had
estimated
that
he
ought
to
get
a
credits
for
hoddan
delivered
to
derec
and
the
waldenian
police
been
unable
to
get
the
police
official
derec
merely
sat
miserably
by
and
said
nothing
to
promise
more
than
half
so
much
but
he
closed
the
deal
and
sent
for
hoddan
and
hoddan
was
gone
now
the
landing
of
this
spaceboat
roused
a
lively
uneasiness
in
don
loris
it
might
be
new
bargainers
for
hoddan
it
might
be
anything
hoddan
had
said
he
had
a
secret
this
might
be
it
don
loris
vexedly
tried
to
contrive
some
useful
skulduggery
without
the
information
to
base
it
on
fani
looked
at
the
spaceboat
with
bright
eyes
thal
was
back
at
the
castle
he
told
her
of
hoddan
riding
up
to
the
spaceboat
near
another
chieftain
castle
entering
it
and
that
then
it
had
taken
to
the
skies
in
an
aura
of
flames
and
smoke
and
thunder
fani
hoped
that
he
might
have
returned
here
in
it
but
she
worried
while
she
waited
for
him
to
do
something
hoddan
did
nothing
the
spaceboat
gave
no
sign
of
life
the
sun
set
and
the
sky
twinkled
with
darting
lights
which
flew
toward
the
west
and
vanished
twilight
followed
and
more
lights
flashed
across
the
heavens
as
if
pursuing
the
sun
fani
had
learned
to
associate
three
and
then
nine
such
lights
with
spacecraft
but
she
could
not
dream
of
a
fleet
of
hundreds
she
dismissed
the
lights
from
her
mind
being
much
more
concerned
with
hoddan
he
would
be
in
as
bad
a
fix
as
ever
if
he
came
out
of
the
boat
twilight
remained
a
fairy
in
which
all
things
looked
much
more
charming
than
they
really
were
and
don
loris
reduced
to
peevish
sputtering
by
pure
mystery
summoned
thal
to
him
it
should
be
remembered
that
don
loris
knew
nothing
of
the
disappearance
of
the
spaceboat
from
his
neighbor
land
he
knew
nothing
of
thal
journey
with
hoddan
but
he
did
remember
that
hoddan
had
seemed
unworried
at
breakfast
and
explained
his
calm
by
saying
that
he
had
a
secret
the
feudal
chieftain
worried
lest
this
spaceboat
be
it
thal
said
don
loris
peevishly
sitting
beside
the
great
fireplace
in
the
enormous
draughty
hall
you
know
this
bron
hoddan
better
than
anybody
else
thal
breathed
heavily
he
turned
pale
where
is
he
demanded
don
loris
i
do
know
said
thal
it
was
true
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
hoddan
had
vanished
into
the
sky
what
does
he
plan
to
do
demanded
don
loris
i
do
know
said
thal
helplessly
where
does
that
that
thing
outside
the
castle
come
from
i
do
know
said
thal
don
loris
drummed
on
the
arm
of
his
intricately
carved
chair
i
do
like
people
who
do
know
things
he
said
fretfully
there
must
be
somebody
in
that
thing
why
do
they
show
themselves
what
are
they
here
for
why
did
they
come
down
especially
here
because
of
bron
hoddan
i
do
know
said
thal
humbly
then
go
find
out
snapped
don
loris
take
a
reasonable
guard
with
you
the
thing
must
have
a
door
knock
on
it
and
ask
who
inside
and
why
they
came
here
tell
them
i
sent
you
to
ask
thal
saluted
with
his
teeth
tending
to
chatter
he
gathered
a
of
his
fellows
and
went
tramping
out
the
castle
gate
some
of
the
half
dozen
had
been
involved
in
the
rescue
of
the
lady
fani
from
ghek
they
were
still
in
a
happy
mood
because
of
the
plunder
brought
back
it
was
much
more
than
a
mere
retainer
could
usually
hope
for
in
a
year
what
this
all
about
thal
demanded
one
of
them
as
thal
arranged
them
in
two
lines
to
make
a
proper
military
appearance
spears
dressed
upright
and
on
their
left
arms
frrrrd
barked
thal
and
they
swung
into
motion
two
three
four
two
three
four
two
three
the
cadence
was
established
thal
said
gloomily
don
loris
said
to
find
out
who
landed
that
thing
out
yonder
and
he
keeps
asking
me
about
bron
hoddan
too
he
strode
in
step
with
the
others
the
seven
men
made
an
impressively
soldierly
group
tramping
away
from
the
castle
wall
what
happened
to
him
asked
a
man
he
marched
on
eyes
front
chest
out
swinging
splendidly
in
time
with
his
marching
that
lad
has
a
nose
for
loot
do
take
it
himself
though
if
he
set
up
in
business
as
a
chieftain
now
two
three
four
muttered
thal
two
three
don
loris
a
hard
chieftain
growled
the
man
in
the
second
file
plenty
of
grub
and
beer
but
no
fighting
and
no
loot
i
get
to
go
with
you
characters
the
other
day
but
what
you
brought
back
was
half
of
what
was
there
mourned
a
man
was
half
those
pistols
he
issued
got
shot
out
and
we
had
to
get
outta
there
fast
here
this
thing
thal
what
do
we
do
with
it
hrrrmp
barked
thal
he
stared
at
the
motionless
seemingly
lifeless
shapeless
spaceboat
he
seen
one
like
it
earlier
today
that
one
spouted
fire
and
went
up
out
of
sight
he
was
wary
of
this
one
he
grumbled
those
pipes
in
the
back
of
it
steer
clear
of
they
spit
fire
no
door
on
this
side
don
loris
said
knock
on
the
door
we
go
around
the
front
frrrrd
two
three
four
two
three

turn
here
and
mind
those
rocks
don
loris
give
us
hell
if
somebody
fell
down
left
turn
again
two
three
four
the
seven
men
tramped
splendidly
around
the
front
of
the
lifeboat
on
the
far
side
its
bulk
hid
even
don
loris
castle
from
view
the
six
spearmen
with
thal
came
to
a
second
halt
here
goes
rumbled
thal
i
tell
you
boys
if
she
starts
to
spit
fire
you
get
the
hell
away
he
marched
up
to
the
spaceboat
port
he
knocked
on
it
there
was
no
response
he
knocked
again
hoddan
opened
the
door
he
nodded
cheerfully
to
thal
thal
glad
to
see
you
i
been
hoping
you
come
over
this
way
who
with
you
he
peered
through
the
semidarkness
some
of
the
boys
eh
come
in
he
beckoned
and
said
casually
lean
your
spears
against
the
hull
there
thal
hesitated
and
was
lost
the
others
obeyed
there
were
clatterings
as
the
steel
spearheads
came
to
rest
against
the
metal
hull
six
of
don
loris
retainers
followed
thal
admiringly
into
the
spaceboat
interior
to
gaze
at
it
and
that
bron
hoddan
who
so
recently
had
given
three
of
them
and
nearly
half
a
score
of
their
fellows
the
chance
to
loot
a
nearby
castle
sit
down
said
hoddan
cordially
if
you
want
to
feel
what
a
spaceboat
really
like
clasp
the
seat
belts
around
you
you
feel
exactly
like
you
about
to
make
a
journey
out
of
atmosphere
it
lean
back
you
notice
there
are
no
viewports
in
the
hull
because
we
use
these
visionscreens
to
see
around
with
he
flicked
on
the
screens
thal
and
his
companions
were
charmed
to
see
the
landscape
outside
portrayed
on
screens
hoddan
shifted
the
toward
infra
red
and
details
came
out
that
would
have
been
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
with
the
boatport
closed
said
hoddan
like
this
the
port
clanged
shut
and
grumbled
for
half
a
second
as
the
went
home
we
all
set
for
i
need
only
get
into
the
pilot
seat
he
did
so
and
throw
on
the
fuel
pump
a
tiny
humming
sounded
and
we
move
when
i
advance
this
throttle
he
pressed
the
there
was
a
roar
there
was
a
terrific
pressure
the
seven
men
from
don
loris
stronghold
were
pressed
back
in
their
seats
with
an
overwhelming
irresistible
pressure
which
held
them
absolutely
helpless
their
mouths
dropped
open
appalled
protests
tried
to
come
out
but
were
pushed
back
by
the
seemingly
acceleration
the
screens
showing
the
outside
displayed
a
great
and
confused
tumult
of
smoke
and
fumes
and
dust
to
rearward
they
showed
only
stars
ahead
those
stars
grew
brighter
and
brighter
as
the
roar
of
the
rockets
diminished
to
a
merely
deafening
sound
suddenly
the
disk
of
the
local
sun
appeared
rising
above
the
horizon
to
the
west
the
spaceboat
naturally
overtook
it
as
it
rose
into
an
orbit
headed
east
to
west
instead
of
the
other
way
about
presently
hoddan
turned
off
the
fuel
pump
he
turned
to
look
thoughtfully
at
the
seven
men
they
were
very
pale
they
sat
unanimously
very
still
because
they
could
see
in
the
vision
plates
that
a
strange
mottled
surface
flowed
past
them
with
an
appalling
velocity
they
were
very
much
afraid
that
they
knew
what
it
was
they
did
it
was
the
surface
of
the
planet
darth
well
below
them
i
glad
you
boys
came
along
said
hoddan
we
catch
up
with
the
fleet
in
a
moment
or
two
the
pirate
fleet
you
know
i
very
pleased
with
you
not
many
groundlings
would
volunteer
for
not
even
with
the
loot
there
is
in
it
thal
choked
slightly
but
no
one
else
made
a
sound
no
one
even
protested
protests
would
have
been
no
use
there
were
looks
of
anguish
but
nothing
else
because
hoddan
was
the
only
one
in
the
spaceboat
who
had
the
least
idea
of
how
to
get
it
down
again
his
passengers
had
to
go
along
for
the
ride
he
taken
them
for
no
matter
where
it
led
numbly
they
waited
for
what
would
befall
viii
hoddan
did
not
worry
about
his
followers
captives
noting
the
obsolescence
of
the
space
fleet
into
which
they
presently
drifted
ancient
hulks
and
impractical
oddities
did
not
seem
antique
or
freakish
to
them
they
had
no
standards
in
such
matters
the
planet
darth
seemed
slightly
off
to
one
side
in
space
at
some
times
and
at
others
it
seemed
underfoot
while
at
others
it
looked
directly
overhead
at
all
times
it
moved
visibly
while
the
spaceboat
and
the
ships
in
orbit
seemed
merely
to
float
in
nearly
fixed
positions
when
the
dark
part
of
darth
appeared
to
roll
toward
the
spaceboat
again
all
the
bright
specks
which
were
ships
about
them
winked
out
of
sight
and
there
were
only
faraway
stars
and
a
vast
blackness
off
to
one
side
like
nothingness
made
visible
illustration
the
spearmen
were
wholly
subdued
when
there
was
light
once
more
and
eccentric
shapes
around
them
there
was
a
the
hull
like
a
metal
wheel
with
a
huge
tire
with
pipe
passages
from
the
tire
part
to
the
hub
where
the
control
room
was
located
it
seemed
unbelievable
that
such
a
relic
could
still
exist
dating
as
it
did
from
the
period
before
could
be
put
into
spacecraft
it
would
have
provided
a
crazy
sort
of
gravity
by
spinning
as
it
limped
from
one
place
to
another
whoever
had
collected
this
fleet
for
the
emigrants
from
colin
must
have
required
only
one
thing
that
there
be
a
hull
given
something
that
would
hold
air
a
lawlor
drive
a
and
air
apparatus
would
turn
it
into
a
ship
that
could
go
into
overdrive
and
hence
cross
the
galaxy
at
need
those
who
bargained
with
the
emigrants
had
been
content
to
furnish
nothing
more
than
that
but
this
could
not
be
appreciated
by
hoddan
involuntary
crew
the
spaceboat
drew
up
alongside
the
gigantic
hulk
which
was
the
leader
the
seven
darthians
were
still
numbed
by
their
kidnaping
and
the
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
they
looked
with
dull
eyes
at
the
mountainous
object
they
approached
it
had
actually
been
designed
as
a
of
space
intended
to
carry
smaller
craft
to
fight
nonexistent
warships
under
conditions
which
never
came
about
it
must
have
been
sold
for
scrap
a
couple
of
hundred
years
since
and
patched
up
for
this
emigration
hoddan
waited
for
the
huge
door
to
open
it
did
he
headed
into
the
opening
noticing
as
he
did
so
that
an
object
two
or
three
times
the
size
of
the
spaceboat
was
already
there
it
cut
down
the
room
for
maneuvering
but
a
thing
once
done
is
easier
thereafter
hoddan
got
the
boat
inside
and
there
was
a
very
small
scraping
and
the
great
door
closed
before
the
boat
could
drift
out
again
hoddan
turned
to
his
companions
followers
victims
once
the
spaceboat
was
still
this
he
said
in
a
manner
which
could
only
be
described
as
one
of
smiling
ferocity
is
a
pirate
ship
belonging
to
the
pirate
fleet
we
passed
through
on
the
way
here
it
manned
by
characters
so
murderous
that
their
leaders
do
dare
land
anywhere
away
from
their
home
or
all
the
galaxy
would
combine
against
them
to
exterminate
them
or
be
exterminated
you
joined
that
fleet
going
to
get
out
of
this
boat
and
march
over
that
ship
yonder
then
you
going
to
be
space
pirates
under
me
they
quivered
but
did
not
protest
i
try
you
for
one
voyage
he
told
them
there
will
be
plunder
there
will
be
pirate
revels
if
you
serve
faithfully
and
fight
well
i
return
you
to
don
loris
stronghold
with
your
loot
after
the
one
voyage
if
you
do
he
grinned
mirthlessly
at
them
out
the
air
lock
with
you
to
float
forever
between
the
stars
understand
the
last
was
pure
savagery
they
cringed
the
meter
went
up
to
normal
hoddan
turned
off
the
visionscreens
so
ending
any
view
of
the
interior
of
the
hold
he
opened
the
port
and
went
out
sitting
in
something
like
continued
paralysis
in
their
seats
the
seven
spearmen
of
darth
heard
his
voice
in
conversation
outside
the
boat
they
could
catch
no
words
but
hoddan
tone
was
strictly
businesslike
he
came
back
all
right
he
said
shortly
thal
march
over
thal
gulped
he
loosened
his
seat
belt
the
enlistment
of
the
seven
in
the
pirate
fleet
was
tacitly
acknowledged
they
were
unarmed
save
for
the
conventional
large
knives
at
their
belts
frrrd
rasped
thal
with
a
lump
in
his
throat
two
three
four
two
three
four
seven
men
marched
dismally
out
of
the
spaceboat
and
down
to
the
floor
of
the
huge
hold
eyes
front
chests
out
throats
dry
they
marched
to
the
larger
but
still
small
vessel
that
shared
this
hold
compartment
they
marched
into
that
ship
thal
barked
and
they
stopped
they
waited
hoddan
came
in
very
only
moments
later
he
closed
the
entrance
port
so
sealing
the
ship
he
nodded
approvingly
you
can
break
ranks
now
he
said
there
food
and
such
stuff
around
the
ship
yours
but
do
turn
knobs
or
push
buttons
until
asked
me
what
for
he
went
forward
and
a
door
closed
behind
him
he
looked
at
the
control
board
and
could
have
done
with
a
little
information
himself
when
the
ship
was
built
generations
ago
been
controls
installed
which
would
be
quite
useless
now
when
the
present
working
instruments
were
installed
it
had
been
done
so
hastily
that
the
wires
and
relays
behind
them
were
not
concealed
and
it
was
these
that
gave
him
the
clues
to
understand
them
the
space
ark
door
opened
hoddan
backed
his
ship
out
its
rockets
had
surprising
power
he
reflected
that
the
lawlor
drive
would
have
been
designed
for
this
present
ship
either
there
probably
been
a
quantity
order
for
so
many
lawlor
drives
and
they
been
installed
on
whatever
needed
a
modern
which
was
every
ship
in
the
fleet
but
since
this
was
one
of
the
smallest
craft
in
the
lot
with
its
low
mass
it
should
be
fast
we
see
he
said
to
nobody
in
particular
out
in
emptiness
but
naturally
sharing
the
orbit
of
the
ship
from
which
it
had
just
come
hoddan
tried
it
out
tentatively
he
got
the
feel
of
it
then
as
a
matter
of
simple
astrogation
he
got
from
a
low
orbit
to
a
height
where
the
lawlor
drive
would
take
hold
by
mere
touches
of
rocket
power
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
stretching
the
orbit
to
extreme
eccentricity
as
all
the
ships
went
round
the
planet
after
the
fourth
go
round
he
was
fully
five
diameters
out
at
aphelion
he
touched
the
lawlor
drive
button
and
everybody
had
that
very
peculiar
disturbance
of
all
their
senses
which
accompanies
going
into
overdrive
the
small
craft
sped
through
emptiness
at
a
high
multiple
of
the
speed
of
light
hoddan
knowledge
of
astrogation
was
strictly
practical
he
went
over
his
ship
from
a
look
at
it
outside
he
guessed
that
it
once
had
been
a
yacht
various
touches
inside
verified
that
idea
there
were
two
staterooms
all
the
was
for
living
and
supplies
none
was
for
cargo
he
nodded
there
was
a
faint
mustiness
about
it
but
there
been
a
time
when
it
was
some
rich
man
pride
he
went
back
to
the
control
room
to
make
an
estimate
from
the
seat
one
could
see
a
speck
of
brightness
directly
ahead
infinitesimal
dots
of
brightness
appeared
grew
swiftly
brighter
and
then
darted
outward
as
they
darted
they
disappeared
because
their
motion
became
too
swift
to
follow
there
were
of
course
methods
of
measuring
this
phenomenon
so
that
one
could
get
an
accurate
measure
of
one
speed
in
overdrive
hoddan
had
no
instrument
for
the
purpose
but
he
had
the
feel
of
things
this
was
a
very
fast
ship
indeed
at
full
lawlor
thrust
presently
he
went
out
to
the
central
cabin
his
followers
had
found
provisions
there
were
novelties
hydroponic
fruit
for
instance
and
they
gloomily
stuffed
themselves
they
were
almost
resigned
now
memory
of
the
loot
he
led
other
men
to
at
ghek
castle
inclined
them
to
be
hopeful
but
they
looked
uneasy
when
he
stopped
where
they
were
gathered
well
he
said
sharply
thal
swallowed
we
have
been
companions
bron
hoddan
he
said
unhappily
we
fought
together
in
great
battles
two
against
fifty
and
we
plundered
the
slain
true
enough
agreed
hoddan
if
thal
wanted
to
edit
his
memories
of
the
fighting
at
the
spaceport
that
was
all
right
with
him
now
headed
for
something
much
better
but
what
asked
thal
miserably
here
we
are
high
above
our
native
world
oh
no
said
hoddan
you
could
even
pick
out
its
sun
from
where
we
are
now
thal
gulped
i
do
not
understand
what
you
want
with
us
he
protested
we
are
not
experienced
in
space
we
are
simple
men
you
pirates
now
hoddan
told
him
with
a
sort
of
genial
bloodthirstiness
you
do
what
i
tell
you
until
we
fight
then
fight
well
or
die
that
all
you
need
to
know
he
left
them
when
men
are
to
be
led
it
is
rarely
wise
to
discuss
policy
or
tactics
with
them
most
men
work
best
when
they
know
only
what
is
expected
of
them
then
they
ca
get
confused
and
they
do
not
get
ideas
of
how
to
do
things
better
hoddan
inspected
the
yacht
more
carefully
there
were
still
traces
of
decorative
features
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
but
the
mere
antiquity
of
the
ship
made
hoddan
hunt
more
carefully
he
found
a
small
compartment
packed
solidly
with
supplies
a
did
not
belong
where
it
was
he
hauled
out
stuff
to
make
sure
it
was
it
had
been
a
machine
shop
in
miniature
in
the
early
days
before
spacephones
were
devices
a
yacht
or
a
ship
that
went
beyond
orbital
distance
was
strictly
on
its
own
if
there
were
a
breakdown
it
was
strictly
private
it
had
to
repair
itself
or
else
so
all
early
spacecraft
carried
amazingly
complete
equipment
for
repairs
only
liners
are
equipped
that
way
in
recent
generations
and
it
is
almost
for
their
tool
shops
to
be
used
but
there
was
the
remnant
of
a
shop
on
the
yacht
that
hoddan
had
in
hand
for
his
errand
to
walden
he
told
the
emigrant
leaders
that
he
went
to
ask
for
charity
he
just
assured
his
followers
that
their
journey
was
for
piracy
now
he
began
to
empty
the
cubbyhole
of
all
the
items
that
had
been
packed
into
it
for
storage
it
had
been
very
ingenious
this
miniature
repair
shop
the
lathe
was
built
in
with
of
the
walls
as
part
of
its
structure
the
drill
press
was
recessed
the
welding
apparatus
had
its
coils
and
condensers
under
the
floor
the
briefest
of
examinations
showed
the
condensers
to
be
in
bad
shape
and
the
coils
might
be
hopeless
but
there
was
good
material
used
in
the
old
days
hoddan
began
to
have
quite
unreasonable
hopes
he
went
back
to
the
control
room
to
meditate
he
had
a
reasonably
sound
plan
of
action
for
the
pirating
of
a
even
though
he
had
no
weapons
mounted
on
the
ship
nor
anything
more
deadly
than
for
his
reluctant
crew
but
he
considered
it
likely
that
he
could
make
the
same
sort
of
landing
with
this
yacht
that
he
already
done
with
the
spaceboat
which
should
be
enough
if
he
waited
off
walden
until
a
liner
went
down
to
the
planet
great
spaceport
he
could
try
it
he
would
go
into
a
close
orbit
around
walden
which
would
bring
him
very
low
over
the
landing
grid
within
an
hour
or
so
of
the
liner
landing
he
turn
the
yacht
end
for
end
and
apply
full
rocket
power
for
deceleration
the
yacht
would
drop
like
a
stone
into
the
landing
grid
everything
would
happen
too
quickly
for
the
grid
crew
to
think
of
clapping
a
force
field
on
it
or
for
them
to
manage
it
if
they
tried
he
be
aground
before
they
realized
it
the
rest
was
simply
fast
action
hoddan
and
seven
darthians
humming
would
tumble
out
of
the
yacht
and
dash
for
the
control
room
of
the
grid
hoddan
would
smash
the
controls
then
rush
the
landed
liner
seize
it
shoot
down
anybody
who
tried
to
oppose
them
and
seal
up
the
ship
and
then
they
take
off
on
the
liner
rockets
which
were
carried
for
emergency
landing
only
but
could
be
used
for
a
single
after
one
such
use
they
be
exhausted
and
with
the
grid
controls
smashed
nobody
could
even
try
to
stop
them
it
was
a
bad
idea
he
had
a
good
deal
of
confidence
in
it
it
was
the
reason
for
his
darthian
crew
nobody
expect
such
a
thing
to
be
tried
so
it
almost
certainly
could
be
done
but
it
did
have
the
drawback
that
the
yacht
would
have
to
be
left
behind
a
dead
loss
when
the
liner
was
seized
hoddan
thought
it
over
soberly
long
before
he
reached
walden
of
course
he
could
have
his
own
crew
so
terrified
that
they
fight
like
fiends
for
fear
of
what
he
might
do
to
them
if
they
did
but
if
he
could
keep
the
also
he
nodded
gravely
he
liked
the
new
possibility
if
it
did
work
there
was
the
first
plan
in
reserve
in
any
case
he
get
a
modern
and
a
suitable
cargo
to
present
to
the
emigrants
of
colin
and
afterward
there
were
certain
electronic
circuits
which
were
akin
the
lawlor
drive
unit
formed
a
force
field
a
stress
in
space
into
which
a
nearby
ship
necessarily
moved
the
angle
came
from
the
fact
that
it
worked
like
a
donkey
trotting
after
a
carrot
held
in
front
of
him
by
a
stick
the
ship
moving
into
the
stressed
area
moved
the
stress
the
force
fields
of
a
landing
grid
were
similar
a
tuning
principle
was
involved
but
basically
a
landing
grid
clamped
an
area
of
stress
around
a
spaceship
and
the
ship
could
move
out
of
it
when
the
landing
grid
moved
the
stressed
area
up
or
down
why
that
was
it
all
this
was
known
to
everybody
but
a
third
trick
had
been
evolved
on
zan
it
was
based
on
the
fact
that
ball
lightning
could
be
generated
by
a
circuit
fundamentally
akin
to
the
other
two
ball
lightning
was
an
area
of
space
so
stressed
that
its
could
leak
out
only
very
slowly
unless
it
made
contact
with
a
conductor
when
all
bets
were
off
it
blew
and
the
zan
pirates
used
ball
lightning
to
force
the
surrender
of
their
victims
hoddan
began
to
draw
diagrams
the
lawlor
had
been
installed
long
after
the
yacht
was
built
it
would
be
modern
with
no
nonsense
about
it
with
of
its
electronic
components
cut
out
and
other
ones
cut
in
it
would
become
a
perfectly
practical
ball
lightning
generator
capable
of
placing
bolts
wherever
one
wanted
them
this
was
standard
zan
practice
hoddan
grandfather
had
used
it
for
years
it
had
the
advantage
that
it
could
be
used
inside
a
gravity
field
where
a
lawlor
drive
could
not
it
had
the
other
advantage
that
commercial
spacecraft
could
not
mount
such
gadgets
for
defense
because
the
insurance
companies
objected
to
meddling
with
lawlor
drive
installations
hoddan
set
to
work
with
the
remnants
of
a
tool
shop
on
the
ancient
yacht
and
some
antique
coils
and
condensers
and
such
he
became
filled
with
zest
he
almost
forgot
that
he
was
the
skipper
of
an
elderly
craft
which
should
have
been
scrapped
before
he
was
born
but
even
he
grew
hungry
and
he
realized
that
nobody
offered
him
food
he
went
indignantly
into
the
yacht
central
saloon
and
found
his
seven
snoring
stertorously
sprawled
in
stray
places
here
and
there
he
woke
them
with
great
sternness
he
set
them
furiously
to
work
on
that
housekeeping
including
meals
which
can
be
neglected
in
a
feudal
castle
because
strong
outside
winds
blow
smells
away
and
dry
up
smelly
objects
but
which
must
be
practiced
in
a
spaceship
he
went
back
to
work
suddenly
he
stopped
and
meditated
afresh
and
ceased
his
actual
labor
to
draw
a
diagram
which
he
regarded
with
great
affection
he
returned
to
his
adaptation
of
the
lawlor
drive
to
the
production
of
ball
lightning
it
was
possible
to
wind
coils
a
certain
percentage
of
the
old
condensers
held
a
charge
he
tapped
the
for
brazing
current
and
the
became
a
device
for
small
parts
he
built
up
the
elements
of
a
vacuum
tube
such
as
is
normally
found
only
in
a
landing
grid
control
room
he
set
up
a
arrangement
in
the
base
of
a
large
glass
jar
he
put
that
jar
in
the
boat
air
lock
bled
the
air
to
emptiness
and
flashed
the
tube
quaint
elements
he
brought
it
back
and
went
out
of
overdrive
while
he
hooked
the
entire
new
assembly
into
the
with
and
switches
to
be
operated
from
the
yacht
instrument
board
finished
he
examined
the
stars
the
nearby
suns
were
totally
strange
in
their
arrangement
but
the
coalsack
area
was
a
good
for
half
a
sector
of
the
galaxy
there
was
a
condensation
in
the
nearer
rim
for
a
second
bearing
and
a
certain
calcium
cloud
with
a
behind
it
was
as
good
as
a
highway
sign
for
locating
one
self
he
lined
up
the
yacht
again
and
went
into
overdrive
once
more
two
days
later
he
came
out
again
surveyed
the
cosmos
again
went
into
overdrive
again
came
out
once
more
made
a
hop
in
travel
and
he
was
in
the
solar
system
of
which
walden
was
the
ornament
and
pride
he
used
the
telescope
and
contemplated
walden
on
its
screen
the
space
yacht
moved
briskly
toward
it
his
seven
darthian
crewmen
aware
of
coming
action
dolefully
sharpened
their
knives
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
but
they
were
far
from
happy
hoddan
shared
their
depression
such
gloomy
anticipations
before
stirring
events
are
proof
that
a
man
is
not
a
fool
hoddan
grandfather
had
been
known
to
observe
that
when
a
man
can
imagine
all
kinds
of
troubles
and
risks
and
disasters
ahead
of
him
he
is
usually
right
hoddan
shared
that
view
but
it
would
not
do
to
back
out
now
he
examined
walden
painstakingly
while
the
yacht
sped
on
he
saw
an
ocean
come
out
of
the
twilight
zone
of
dawn
by
the
charts
the
capital
city
and
the
spaceport
should
be
on
that
ocean
western
shore
after
a
suitable
and
very
long
interval
the
site
of
the
capital
city
came
around
the
edge
of
the
planet
from
a
bare
hundred
thousand
miles
hoddan
stepped
up
magnification
to
its
limit
and
looked
again
then
walden
more
than
filled
the
field
he
could
see
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
planet
surface
he
had
to
hunt
before
he
found
the
capital
city
again
then
it
was
very
clear
he
saw
the
curving
lines
of
its
highways
and
the
pattern
of
its
streets
buildings
as
such
however
did
not
show
but
he
made
out
the
spaceport
and
the
shadow
of
the
landing
grid
and
in
the
very
center
of
that
grid
there
was
something
silvery
which
cast
a
shadow
of
its
own
a
ship
a
liner
there
was
a
tap
on
the
door
thal
anything
happening
he
asked
uneasily
i
just
sighted
the
ship
we
going
to
take
said
hoddan
thal
looked
unhappy
he
withdrew
hoddan
plotted
out
the
extremely
roundabout
course
he
must
take
to
end
up
with
the
liner
and
the
yacht
traveling
in
the
same
direction
and
the
same
speed
so
capture
would
be
possible
he
put
the
yacht
on
the
line
required
he
threw
on
full
power
actually
he
headed
partly
away
from
his
intended
victim
the
little
yacht
plunged
forward
nothing
seemed
to
happen
time
passed
hoddan
had
nothing
to
do
but
worry
he
worried
thal
tapped
on
the
door
again
about
time
to
get
ready
to
fight
he
asked
dolefully
not
yet
said
hoddan
i
running
away
from
our
victim
now
another
half
hour
the
course
changed
the
yacht
was
around
behind
walden
the
whole
planet
lay
between
it
and
its
intended
prey
the
course
of
the
small
ship
curved
now
it
would
pass
almost
close
enough
to
clip
the
topmost
tips
of
walden
atmosphere
there
was
nothing
for
hoddan
to
do
but
think
morbid
thoughts
he
thought
them
the
lawlor
drive
began
to
burble
he
cut
it
off
he
sat
gloomily
in
the
control
room
occasionally
glancing
at
the
nearing
expanse
of
rushing
mottled
surface
presented
by
the
planet
its
attraction
bent
the
path
of
the
yacht
it
was
now
a
parabolic
curve
presently
the
surface
diminished
a
little
the
yacht
was
increasing
its
distance
from
it
hoddan
used
the
telescope
he
searched
the
space
ahead
with
field
he
found
the
liner
it
rose
steadily
the
grid
still
thrust
it
upward
with
an
even
continuous
acceleration
it
had
to
be
not
less
than
forty
thousand
miles
out
before
it
could
take
to
overdrive
but
at
that
distance
it
would
have
an
outward
velocity
which
would
take
it
on
out
indefinitely
at
ten
thousand
miles
certainly
the
would
let
go
they
did
hoddan
could
tell
because
the
liner
had
been
pointed
base
down
toward
the
planet
when
the
force
fields
picked
it
up
now
it
wabbled
slightly
it
was
free
it
was
no
longer
held
solidly
from
now
on
it
floated
up
on
momentum
hoddan
nibbled
at
his
fingernails
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
forty
minutes
more
presently
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
thirty
for
twenty
ten
five
three
two
the
liner
was
barely
twenty
miles
away
when
hoddan
fired
his
rockets
they
made
a
colossal
cloud
of
vapor
in
emptiness
the
yacht
stirred
faintly
shifted
deftly
lost
just
a
suitable
amount
of
velocity
which
now
was
nearly
straight
up
from
the
planet
and
moved
with
precision
and
directness
toward
the
liner
hoddan
stirred
his
controls
and
swung
the
whole
small
ship
here
obviously
he
could
not
use
the
for
its
proper
purpose
but
a
switch
cut
out
certain
elements
of
the
lawlor
unit
and
cut
in
those
others
which
made
the
modified
into
a
ball
lightning
projector
a
flaming
speck
of
pure
incandescence
sped
from
the
yacht
through
emptiness
it
would
miss
no
hoddan
swerved
it
it
struck
the
hull
it
would
momentarily
paralyze
every
bit
of
electric
equipment
in
the
ship
it
would
definitely
not
go
unnoticed
calling
liner
said
hoddan
painfully
into
a
microphone
calling
liner
we
are
pirates
attacking
your
ship
you
have
ten
seconds
to
get
into
your
lifeboats
or
we
will
hull
you
he
settled
back
again
nibbling
at
his
fingernails
he
was
acutely
disturbed
at
the
end
of
ten
seconds
the
distance
between
the
two
ships
was
perceptibly
less
he
flung
a
second
ball
lightning
bolt
across
the
diminished
space
he
sent
it
whirling
round
and
round
the
liner
in
a
tight
spiral
he
ended
by
having
it
touch
the
liner
bow
liquid
light
ran
over
the
entire
hull
your
ten
seconds
are
up
he
said
worriedly
if
you
do
get
out
but
then
he
relaxed
a
on
the
liner
opened
the
boat
did
not
release
itself
it
could
not
possibly
take
on
its
complement
of
passengers
and
crew
in
so
short
a
time
the
opening
of
the
blister
was
a
sign
of
surrender
the
two
first
ball
lightning
bolts
were
miniatures
hoddan
now
projected
a
ball
it
glittered
viciously
in
emptiness
the
necessary
for
its
existence
furnishing
a
medium
for
radiation
it
sped
toward
the
liner
and
hung
off
its
side
menacingly
the
yacht
from
darth
moved
steadily
closer
five
miles
two
all
out
said
hoddan
regretfully
we
ca
wait
any
longer
a
boat
darted
away
from
the
liner
a
second
a
third
and
fourth
and
fifth
the
last
boat
lingered
desperately
the
yacht
was
less
than
a
mile
away
when
it
broke
free
and
plunged
frantically
toward
the
planet
it
had
left
a
little
while
before
the
other
boats
were
already
streaking
downward
trails
of
expanding
behind
them
the
crew
of
the
landing
grid
would
pick
them
up
for
safe
and
gentle
landing
hoddan
sighed
in
relief
he
played
delicately
upon
the
he
carefully
maneuvered
the
very
last
of
the
novelties
he
had
built
into
an
originally
simple
lawlor
the
two
ships
came
together
with
a
distinct
clanking
sound
it
seemed
horribly
loud
thal
jerked
open
the
door
hit
something
do
we
fight
hoddan
said
ruefully
i
forgot
the
fighting
over
but
bring
your
stay
behind
but
somebody
might
have
gotten
left
he
rose
to
take
over
the
captured
ship
illustration
ix
normally
at
overdrive
cruising
speed
it
would
be
a
week
journey
from
walden
to
the
planet
krim
hoddan
made
it
in
five
days
there
was
reason
he
wanted
to
beat
the
news
of
his
piracy
to
krim
he
could
endure
suspicion
and
he
would
mind
doubt
but
he
did
not
want
certainty
of
his
nefarious
behavior
to
interfere
with
the
purposes
of
his
call
the
space
yacht
sealed
tightly
floated
in
an
orbit
far
out
in
emptiness
the
big
ship
went
down
alone
by
landing
grid
it
glittered
brightly
as
it
descended
when
it
touched
ground
and
the
grid
force
fields
cut
off
it
looked
very
modern
and
very
crisp
and
strictly
businesslike
actually
the
capture
of
this
particular
liner
was
a
bit
of
luck
for
hoddan
it
was
not
one
of
the
giant
ships
which
make
runs
of
thousands
of
and
deign
to
stop
only
at
very
major
planets
it
was
a
medium
ship
of
five
thousand
tons
burden
designed
for
service
in
the
horsehead
nebula
region
it
was
and
on
the
way
from
its
builders
to
its
owners
when
hoddan
interfered
naturally
though
it
carried
cargo
on
its
maiden
voyage
hoddan
spoke
curtly
to
the
control
room
of
the
grid
i
he
explained
new
ship
i
got
a
freak
charter
party
over
on
walden
and
i
have
to
get
rid
of
my
cargo
how
about
shifting
me
to
a
delay
space
until
i
can
talk
to
some
brokers
the
force
fields
came
on
again
and
the
liner
moved
very
delicately
to
a
position
at
the
side
of
the
grid
central
space
there
it
would
be
out
of
the
way
hoddan
dressed
himself
carefully
in
garments
found
in
the
skipper
cabin
he
found
thal
wearing
an
apron
and
an
embittered
expression
he
ceased
to
wield
a
mop
as
hoddan
halted
before
him
i
going
ashore
said
hoddan
crisply
you
in
charge
until
i
get
back
in
charge
of
what
demanded
thal
bitterly
of
a
bunch
of
male
housemaids
i
run
a
mop
and
me
a
darthian
gentleman
i
thought
i
was
being
a
pirate
what
do
i
do
i
scrub
floors
i
wash
paint
i
stencil
cases
in
cargo
holds
i
paint
over
names
and
put
others
in
their
places
me
a
darthian
gentleman
no
said
hoddan
a
pirate
if
i
do
get
back
you
and
the
others
ca
work
this
ship
and
presently
the
police
of
krim
will
ask
why
they
recheck
my
careful
forgeries
and
you
all
be
hung
for
piracy
so
do
let
anybody
in
do
talk
to
anybody
if
you
do
he
drew
his
finger
across
his
throat
and
nodded
and
went
cheerfully
out
the
crew
in
the
very
base
of
the
ship
he
went
across
the
tarmac
and
out
between
two
of
the
gigantic
steel
arches
of
the
grid
he
hired
a
ground
vehicle
where
asked
the
driver
said
hoddan
there
a
firm
of
lawyers
i
ca
remember
the
name
there
millions
of
said
the
driver
this
is
a
special
one
explained
hoddan
it
so
dignified
they
talk
to
you
unless
you
a
of
a
client
they
so
ethical
they
wo
touch
a
case
of
under
a
million
credits
they
got
about
nineteen
names
in
the
firm
title
and
oh
said
the
driver
that
be
hell
i
ca
remember
the
name
either
but
i
take
you
there
he
drove
out
into
traffic
hoddan
relaxed
then
he
tensed
again
he
had
not
been
in
a
city
since
he
stopped
briefly
in
this
on
the
way
to
darth
the
traffic
was
abominable
and
he
who
been
in
various
pitched
battles
on
darth
and
had
only
lately
captured
a
ship
in
space
hoddan
grew
apprehensive
as
his
charged
into
the
thick
of
hooting
rushing
squealing
vehicles
when
the
car
came
to
a
stop
he
was
relieved
it
yonder
said
the
driver
you
find
the
name
on
the
directory
hoddan
paid
and
went
inside
the
gigantic
building
he
looked
at
the
directory
and
shrugged
he
went
to
the
downstairs
guard
he
explained
that
he
was
looking
for
a
firm
of
lawyers
whose
name
was
not
on
the
directory
list
they
were
extremely
conservative
and
of
the
highest
possible
reputation
they
did
seek
clients
and
said
the
guard
frowning
i
ai
supposed
to
give
it
out
but
floors
hoddan
went
up
he
was
unknown
a
receptionist
looked
at
him
with
surprised
aversion
i
have
a
case
of
space
piracy
said
hoddan
polite
a
member
of
the
firm
please
ten
minutes
later
he
eased
himself
into
the
easiest
of
a
man
of
infinite
dignity
said
well
i
am
said
hoddan
modestly
a
pirate
i
have
a
ship
in
the
spaceport
with
very
convincing
papers
and
a
cargo
of
rigellian
furs
jewelry
from
the
cetis
planets
and
a
rather
large
quantity
of
bulk
melacynth
i
want
to
dispose
of
the
cargo
and
invest
a
considerable
part
of
the
proceeds
in
conservative
stocks
on
krim
the
lawyer
frowned
he
looked
shocked
then
he
said
carefully
you
made
two
statements
one
was
that
you
are
a
pirate
taken
by
itself
that
is
not
my
concern
the
other
is
that
you
wish
to
dispose
of
certain
cargo
and
invest
in
reputable
businesses
on
krim
i
assume
that
there
is
no
connection
between
the
two
observations
he
paused
hoddan
said
nothing
the
lawyer
went
on
with
dignity
of
course
our
firm
is
not
in
the
brokerage
business
however
we
can
represent
you
in
your
dealing
with
local
brokers
and
obviously
we
can
advise
you
i
also
wish
to
buy
said
hoddan
a
complete
shipload
of
agricultural
machinery
a
microfilm
technical
library
machine
tools
technical
instructors
and
libraries
of
tape
for
them
generators
and
such
things
said
the
lawyer
i
will
send
one
of
our
clerks
to
examine
your
cargo
so
he
can
deal
properly
with
the
brokers
you
will
tell
him
in
detail
what
you
wish
to
buy
hoddan
stood
up
i
take
him
to
the
ship
now
he
was
mildly
surprised
at
the
smoothness
with
which
matters
proceeded
he
took
a
young
clerk
to
the
ship
he
showed
him
the
ship
papers
as
edited
by
himself
he
took
him
through
the
cargo
holds
he
discussed
in
some
detail
what
he
wished
to
buy
when
the
clerk
left
thal
came
to
complain
again
look
here
he
said
bitterly
we
scrubbed
this
ship
from
one
end
to
the
other
there
not
a
speck
or
a
fingermark
on
it
and
we
still
scrubbing
we
captured
this
ship
is
this
pirate
revels
hoddan
said
there
money
coming
i
let
you
boys
ashore
with
some
cash
in
your
pockets
presently
brokers
came
escorted
by
the
lawyer
clerk
they
squabbled
furiously
with
him
but
the
dignity
of
the
firm
he
represented
was
extreme
there
was
no
suspicion
no
overt
suspicion
anyhow
and
the
furs
went
the
clerk
painstakingly
informed
hoddan
that
he
could
draw
so
much
more
brokers
came
the
jewelry
went
the
lawyer
clerk
jotted
down
figures
and
told
hoddan
the
net
the
bulk
melacynth
was
taken
over
by
a
group
of
brokers
none
of
whom
could
handle
it
alone
hoddan
drew
cash
and
sent
his
darthians
ashore
with
a
thousand
credits
apiece
with
bright
and
shining
faces
they
headed
for
the
nearest
bars
as
soon
as
my
ship
loaded
hoddan
told
the
clerk
i
want
to
get
them
out
of
jail
the
clerk
nodded
he
brought
salesmen
of
agricultural
machinery
representatives
of
microfilm
libraries
manufacturers
of
generators
instructors
and
allied
lines
hoddan
bought
painstakingly
delivery
was
promised
for
the
next
day
now
said
the
clerk
about
the
investments
you
wish
to
make
with
the
balance
i
want
a
reasonable
sum
in
cash
said
hoddan
reflectively
but
well
i
been
told
that
insurance
is
a
fine
conservative
business
as
i
understand
it
most
insurance
organizations
are
divided
into
divisions
which
are
separately
incorporated
there
will
be
a
division
a
casualty
division
and
so
on
is
that
right
and
one
may
invest
in
any
of
them
separately
the
clerk
said
impassively
i
was
given
to
understand
sir
that
you
are
interested
in
perhaps
especially
covering
piracy
i
was
given
quotations
on
the
divisions
of
all
krim
companies
of
course
those
are
not
very
active
stocks
but
if
there
were
a
rumor
of
a
pirate
ship
acting
in
this
part
of
the
galaxy
one
might
anticipate
i
do
said
hoddan
let
see
my
cargo
brought
so
much
my
purchases
will
come
to
so
much
my
legal
fees
of
course
i
mentioned
a
sum
in
cash
yes
this
will
be
the
balance
more
or
less
which
you
will
put
in
the
stocks
you
named
but
since
i
anticipate
activity
in
them
i
want
to
leave
some
special
instructions
he
gave
a
detailed
thoughtful
account
of
what
he
anticipated
might
be
found
in
news
reports
of
later
dates
the
clerk
noted
it
all
down
impassively
hoddan
added
instructions
yes
sir
said
the
clerk
without
intonation
when
he
was
through
if
you
will
come
to
the
office
in
the
morning
sir
the
papers
will
be
drawn
up
and
matters
can
be
concluded
your
new
cargo
can
hardly
be
delivered
before
then
and
if
i
may
say
so
sir
your
crew
wo
be
ready
i
estimate
two
hours
of
festivity
for
each
man
and
fourteen
hours
for
recovery
thank
you
said
hoddan
i
see
you
in
the
morning
he
sealed
up
the
ship
when
the
lawyer
clerk
departed
then
he
felt
lonely
he
was
the
only
living
thing
in
the
ship
his
footsteps
echoed
hollowly
there
was
nobody
to
speak
to
not
even
anybody
to
threaten
he
done
a
lot
of
threatening
lately
he
went
forlornly
to
the
cabin
once
occupied
by
the
liner
former
skipper
his
loneliness
increased
he
began
to
feel
those
daunting
such
as
plague
the
most
unselfish
and
conscientious
people
his
actions
to
date
of
course
did
not
trouble
him
today
actions
were
the
ones
which
bothered
his
conscience
he
felt
that
they
were
not
quite
adequate
the
balance
left
in
the
lawyer
hands
would
not
be
nearly
enough
to
cover
a
certain
deficit
which
in
justice
he
felt
himself
bound
to
make
up
it
had
been
his
thought
to
make
this
enterprise
everybody
concerned
making
a
profit
including
the
owners
of
the
ship
and
cargo
he
had
pirated
but
he
sure
he
reflected
that
his
grandfather
would
not
have
been
disturbed
about
such
a
matter
that
elderly
pirate
would
have
felt
wholly
at
ease
it
was
his
conviction
that
piracy
was
an
essential
part
of
the
working
of
the
galaxy
economic
system
hoddan
indeed
could
remember
him
saying
precisely
snipping
off
the
ends
of
his
words
as
he
spoke
i
tell
y
piracy
what
keeps
the
galaxy
business
thriving
everybody
knows
business
suffers
when
retail
trade
slacks
down
it
backs
up
the
movement
of
inventories
they
get
too
big
that
backs
up
orders
to
the
factories
they
lay
off
men
and
when
men
are
laid
off
they
have
money
to
spend
so
retail
trade
slacks
off
some
more
and
that
backs
up
inventories
some
more
and
that
backs
up
orders
to
factories
and
makes
unemployment
and
hurts
retail
trade
again
it
a
see
it
was
hoddan
grandfather
custom
at
this
point
to
stare
shrewdly
at
each
of
his
listeners
in
turn
but
suppose
somebody
pirates
a
ship
the
owners
do
lose
insured
they
order
another
ship
built
right
away
men
get
hired
to
build
it
and
they
paid
money
to
spend
in
retail
trade
and
that
moves
inventories
and
industry
picks
up
that
more
people
insure
against
piracy
insurance
companies
hire
more
clerks
and
bookkeepers
they
get
more
money
for
retail
trade
and
to
move
inventories
and
keep
factories
going
and
get
more
people
hired
it
piracy
that
keeps
business
in
this
galaxy
goin
hoddan
had
known
doubts
about
this
but
it
could
not
be
entirely
wrong
he
put
a
good
part
of
the
proceeds
of
his
piracy
in
stocks
and
he
counted
on
them
to
make
all
his
actions
as
benevolent
to
everybody
concerned
as
his
intentions
had
been
and
were
but
it
might
not
be
true
enough
it
might
be
less
than
well
sufficiently
true
in
a
particular
instance
and
therefore
then
he
saw
how
things
could
be
worked
out
so
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
began
to
work
out
the
details
he
drifted
off
to
sleep
in
the
act
of
composing
a
letter
in
his
head
to
his
grandfather
on
the
pirate
planet
zan
when
morning
came
on
krim
catawheel
trucks
came
bringing
gigantic
agricultural
machines
of
a
sort
that
would
normally
never
be
shipped
by
space
freight
there
came
generators
and
turbines
and
tanks
of
plastic
and
instructors
and
great
boxes
full
of
tape
for
them
there
were
machine
tools
and
cutting
tips
these
last
in
vast
quantity
and
very
many
items
that
the
emigrants
of
colin
probably
would
not
expect
and
might
not
even
recognize
the
cargo
holds
of
the
liner
filled
illustration
he
went
to
the
office
of
his
attorneys
he
read
and
signed
papers
in
an
atmosphere
of
great
dignity
and
ethical
purpose
the
lawyer
clerk
attended
him
to
the
police
office
where
seven
dreary
darthians
with
oversized
hangovers
tried
dismally
to
cheer
themselves
by
memories
of
how
they
got
that
way
he
got
them
out
and
to
the
ship
the
clerk
produced
a
rather
weighty
if
small
box
with
an
air
of
extreme
solemnity
the
currency
you
wanted
sir
thank
you
said
hoddan
that
the
last
of
our
business
yes
sir
said
the
clerk
he
hesitated
and
for
the
first
time
showed
a
trace
of
human
curiosity
could
i
ask
a
question
sir
about
piracy
why
not
asked
hoddan
go
ahead
when
you
ah
captured
this
ship
sir
said
the
clerk
hopefully
did
you
ah
shoot
the
men
and
keep
the
women
hoddan
sighed
much
he
said
regretfully
as
i
hate
to
spoil
an
enlivening
theory
no
these
are
modern
days
efficiency
has
invaded
even
the
pirate
business
i
used
my
crew
for
and
cookery
he
closed
the
ship
port
gently
and
went
up
to
the
control
room
to
call
the
landing
grid
operators
in
minutes
the
captured
liner
loaded
down
again
lifted
toward
the
stars
and
all
the
journey
back
to
darth
was
as
anticlimactic
as
that
there
was
no
trouble
finding
the
space
yacht
in
its
remote
orbit
hoddan
sent
out
an
unlocking
signal
and
a
keyed
transmitter
began
to
send
a
signal
on
which
to
home
when
the
liner
nudged
alongside
it
hoddan
last
contrivance
operated
and
the
yacht
clung
fast
to
the
larger
ship
hull
there
were
four
days
in
overdrive
there
were
three
or
four
pauses
for
the
on
krim
had
cost
some
delay
but
hoddan
arrived
back
at
a
positive
sight
of
darth
sun
within
a
day
or
so
of
standard
space
drive
direct
from
walden
then
there
was
little
or
no
time
lost
in
getting
into
orbit
with
the
junk
yard
space
fleet
of
the
emigrants
shortly
thereafter
he
called
the
leader
ship
with
only
mild
worries
about
possible
disasters
that
might
have
happened
while
he
was
away
calling
the
leader
ship
he
said
crisply
calling
the
ship
this
is
bron
hoddan
reporting
back
from
walden
with
a
ship
and
machinery
contributed
for
your
use
the
harsh
voice
of
the
bearded
old
leader
of
the
emigrants
seemed
somehow
broken
when
he
replied
he
called
down
blessings
on
hoddan
who
could
use
them
then
there
was
the
matter
of
getting
emigrants
on
board
the
new
ship
they
did
know
how
to
use
the
lifeboat
tubes
hoddan
had
to
demonstrate
but
shortly
after
there
were
twenty
thirty
fifty
of
the
folk
from
colin
feverishly
searching
the
ship
and
incredulously
reporting
what
they
found
it
impossible
said
the
old
man
it
impossible
i
would
say
that
said
hoddan
it
unlikely
but
it
happened
i
only
afraid
it
not
enough
it
is
many
times
what
we
hoped
said
the
old
man
humbly
only
he
stopped
we
are
more
grateful
than
we
can
say
hoddan
took
a
deep
breath
i
like
to
take
my
crew
back
home
he
explained
and
come
back
and
well
perhaps
i
can
be
useful
explaining
things
and
i
like
to
ask
a
great
favor
of
you
for
my
own
work
but
naturally
said
the
old
man
of
course
we
will
await
your
return
naturally
and
perhaps
we
can
we
can
arrange
something
hoddan
was
relieved
there
did
seem
a
slightly
strange
limitation
to
the
happiness
of
the
emigrants
they
were
passionately
rejoiceful
over
the
agricultural
machinery
but
they
seemed
rather
dutifully
than
truly
happy
over
the
microfilm
library
the
instructors
were
the
objects
of
polite
comment
only
hoddan
felt
a
vague
discomfort
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
secret
desperation
in
the
atmosphere
which
they
would
not
admit
or
mention
but
he
was
coming
back
of
course
he
brought
the
spaceboat
over
to
the
new
liner
he
hooked
onto
a
lifeboat
blister
and
his
seven
darthians
crawled
through
the
lifeboat
tube
hoddan
pulled
away
quickly
before
somebody
thought
to
ask
why
there
were
no
lifeboats
in
the
places
so
plainly
made
for
them
he
headed
downward
when
the
landmarks
on
darth
surface
told
him
that
don
loris
castle
would
shortly
come
over
the
horizon
he
was
just
touching
atmosphere
when
it
did
the
boat
had
been
refilled
and
he
burned
fuel
recklessly
to
make
a
dramatic
landing
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
battlements
where
fani
had
once
thoughtfully
had
a
coil
of
rope
ready
for
him
heads
peered
at
the
lifeboat
over
those
same
battlements
now
but
the
gate
was
closed
it
stayed
closed
there
was
somehow
an
atmosphere
of
suspicion
amounting
to
enmity
hoddan
felt
unwelcome
all
right
boys
he
said
resignedly
out
with
you
and
to
the
castle
you
got
your
loot
from
the
voyage
he
counted
out
for
each
of
them
rather
more
actual
cash
than
any
of
them
really
believed
in
and
i
want
you
to
take
this
box
to
don
loris
it
a
gift
from
me
and
i
want
to
consult
with
him
about
between
the
two
of
us
in
ah
some
plans
i
have
ask
if
i
may
come
and
talk
to
him
his
seven
former
spearmen
tumbled
out
they
marched
gleefully
to
the
castle
gate
hoddan
saw
them
tantalizingly
displaying
large
sums
in
cash
to
the
watchers
above
them
thal
held
up
the
box
for
don
loris
it
was
the
box
the
lawyer
clerk
had
turned
over
to
him
with
a
tidy
sum
in
cash
in
it
the
sum
was
partly
depleted
now
hoddan
had
paid
off
his
involuntary
crew
with
it
had
paid
them
in
fact
as
if
they
done
the
fighting
they
expected
and
he
thought
would
be
necessary
but
there
was
still
more
in
it
than
don
loris
would
have
gotten
from
walden
for
selling
him
out
the
castle
gate
opened
as
if
grudgingly
the
seven
went
in
with
the
box
time
passed
much
time
hoddan
went
over
the
arguments
he
meant
to
use
on
don
loris
he
needed
to
make
up
a
very
great
sum
and
it
could
be
done
but
required
occasional
piratical
raids
which
called
for
pirate
crews
and
if
don
loris
would
encourage
his
retainers
he
could
have
gone
to
another
darthian
chieftain
of
course
but
he
knew
what
kind
of
scoundrel
don
loris
was
he
have
to
find
out
about
another
man
nearly
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
castle
gate
opened
again
two
files
of
spearmen
marched
out
there
were
eight
men
with
a
sergeant
in
command
hoddan
did
not
recognize
any
of
them
they
came
to
the
spaceboat
the
sergeant
formally
presented
an
official
message
don
loris
would
admit
bron
hoddan
to
his
presence
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
hoddan
felt
excessively
uncomfortable
waiting
he
thought
about
that
secret
despair
in
the
emigrant
fleet
he
worried
about
it
he
was
concerned
because
don
loris
had
not
welcomed
him
with
cordiality
now
that
he
brought
back
his
retainers
in
good
working
order
in
a
sudden
gloomy
premonition
he
checked
his
they
needed
charging
he
managed
it
from
the
lifeboat
unit
he
went
forebodingly
toward
the
castle
with
the
eight
spearmen
surrounding
him
as
cops
had
once
surrounded
him
on
walden
he
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
it
he
frowned
to
himself
as
he
went
in
the
castle
gate
and
along
a
long
stone
passage
and
up
stone
stairs
into
the
great
hall
of
state
don
loris
as
once
before
sat
peevishly
by
the
huge
fireplace
this
time
he
was
almost
inside
it
with
its
hood
and
mantel
actually
over
his
head
the
lady
fani
sat
there
with
him
don
loris
seemed
to
put
aside
his
peevishness
only
a
little
to
greet
hoddan
my
dear
fellow
he
said
complainingly
i
do
like
to
welcome
you
with
reproaches
but
do
you
know
that
when
you
absconded
with
that
spaceboat
you
made
a
mortal
enemy
for
me
it
a
fact
my
neighbor
on
whose
land
the
boat
descended
was
deeply
hurt
he
considered
it
his
property
he
had
summoned
his
retainers
for
a
fight
over
it
when
i
heard
of
his
resentment
and
partly
soothed
him
with
apologies
and
presents
but
he
still
considers
that
i
should
return
it
to
him
whenever
you
appear
here
with
it
oh
said
hoddan
that
too
bad
things
looked
ominous
the
lady
fani
looked
at
him
strangely
as
if
she
tried
to
tell
him
something
without
speaking
it
she
looked
as
if
she
had
wept
lately
to
be
sure
said
don
loris
fretfully
you
gave
me
a
very
pretty
present
just
now
but
my
retainers
tell
me
that
you
came
back
with
a
ship
a
very
fine
ship
what
became
of
it
the
landing
grid
has
been
repaired
at
last
and
you
could
have
landed
it
what
happened
to
it
i
gave
it
away
said
hoddan
he
saw
what
fani
was
trying
to
tell
him
one
corridor
no
two
leading
toward
the
great
hall
was
filled
with
spearmen
his
tone
turned
sardonic
i
gave
it
to
a
poor
old
man
don
loris
shook
his
head
that
not
right
hoddan
that
fleet
overhead
now
if
they
are
pirates
and
want
some
of
my
men
for
crews
they
should
come
to
me
i
do
take
kindly
to
the
idea
of
your
kidnaping
my
men
and
carrying
them
off
on
piratical
excursions
they
must
be
profitable
but
if
you
can
afford
to
give
me
presents
like
that
and
be
so
lavish
with
my
retainers
why
i
do
see
why
hoddan
grimaced
i
came
to
arrange
a
deal
on
that
order
he
observed
i
do
think
i
like
it
said
don
loris
peevishly
i
prefer
to
deal
with
people
direct
i
arrange
about
the
landing
grid
and
for
a
regular
recruiting
service
which
i
will
conduct
of
course
but
you
you
are
irresponsible
i
wish
you
well
but
when
you
carry
my
men
off
for
pirates
and
make
my
neighbors
into
my
enemies
and
infect
my
daughter
with
strange
notions
and
the
government
of
a
friendly
planet
asks
me
in
so
many
words
not
to
shelter
you
any
longer
why
the
end
hoddan
so
with
great
regret
the
regret
is
mine
said
hoddan
thoughtfully
he
aimed
a
at
a
slowly
opening
door
he
pulled
the
trigger
yells
followed
its
humming
because
not
everybody
it
hit
was
knocked
out
nor
did
it
hit
everybody
in
the
corridor
men
came
surging
out
of
one
door
and
then
two
to
require
the
attention
of
his
weapons
then
a
spear
went
past
hoddan
face
and
missed
him
only
by
inches
it
buried
its
point
in
the
floor
a
whirling
knife
spun
past
his
nose
he
glanced
up
there
were
balconies
all
around
the
great
hall
and
men
popped
up
from
behind
the
railings
and
threw
things
at
him
they
popped
down
out
of
sight
instantly
there
was
no
rhythm
involved
he
could
not
anticipate
their
rising
nor
shoot
them
through
the
balcony
front
and
more
men
infiltrated
the
hall
getting
behind
heavy
chairs
and
tables
to
push
toward
him
behind
them
as
shovable
shields
more
spears
and
knives
flew
bron
cried
the
lady
fani
throatily
he
thought
she
had
an
exit
for
him
he
sprang
to
her
side
i
i
did
want
you
to
come
she
wept
there
was
a
singular
pause
in
the
clangings
and
clashings
of
weapons
on
the
floor
for
a
second
the
noises
continued
then
they
stopped
then
one
man
popped
up
and
hurled
a
knife
the
clang
of
its
fall
was
a
very
lonely
one
don
loris
fairly
howled
at
him
idiot
think
of
the
lady
fani
the
lady
fani
suddenly
smiled
tremulously
wonderful
she
said
they
do
dare
do
anything
while
you
as
close
to
me
as
this
do
you
suppose
asked
hoddan
i
could
count
on
that
i
certain
of
it
said
fani
and
i
think
you
better
then
excuse
me
said
hoddan
with
great
politeness
he
swung
her
up
and
over
his
shoulder
with
a
in
his
free
hand
he
headed
down
the
hall
outside
she
said
zestfully
get
out
the
side
door
and
turn
left
and
nobody
can
jump
down
on
your
neck
then
left
again
to
the
gate
he
obeyed
now
and
again
he
got
in
a
with
his
pistol
don
loris
had
turned
the
castle
into
a
very
pretty
trap
the
lady
fani
said
plaintively
this
is
terribly
undignified
and
i
ca
see
where
we
going
where
are
we
now
almost
at
the
gate
panted
hoddan
at
it
now
he
swung
out
of
the
massive
entrance
to
don
loris
stronghold
i
can
put
you
down
now
i
would
said
the
lady
fani
in
spite
of
the
end
of
me
uppermost
i
think
you
better
make
for
the
spaceboat
exactly
as
we
are
again
hoddan
obeyed
racing
across
the
open
ground
howls
of
fury
followed
him
it
was
evidently
the
opinion
of
the
castle
that
the
lady
fani
was
to
be
abducted
in
the
place
of
the
seven
returned
spearmen
hoddan
breathing
hard
reached
the
spaceboat
he
put
fani
down
and
said
anxiously
you
all
right
i
very
much
in
your
debt
i
was
in
a
spot
then
he
nodded
toward
the
castle
they
are
upset
are
they
they
must
think
i
mean
to
kidnap
you
the
lady
fani
beamed
it
would
be
terrible
if
you
did
she
said
hopefully
i
could
do
a
thing
to
stop
you
and
a
successful
public
abduction
a
legal
marriage
on
darth
would
it
be
terrible
hoddan
mopped
his
face
and
patted
her
reassuringly
on
the
shoulder
do
worry
he
said
warmly
you
just
got
me
out
of
an
awful
fix
you
my
friend
and
anyhow
i
going
to
marry
a
girl
on
walden
named
nedda
fani
keep
clear
of
the
rocket
blast
he
went
into
the
boatport
turned
to
beam
paternally
back
at
her
and
shut
the
port
behind
him
seconds
later
the
spaceboat
took
off
it
left
behind
clouds
of
rocket
smoke
and
though
hoddan
had
the
faintest
idea
of
it
it
left
behind
the
maddest
girl
in
several
solar
systems
x
it
is
the
custom
of
all
men
everywhere
to
be
obtuse
where
women
are
concerned
hoddan
went
skyward
in
the
spaceboat
with
feelings
of
warm
gratitude
toward
the
lady
fani
he
had
not
the
slightest
inkling
that
she
who
had
twice
spoiled
her
father
skulduggery
so
far
as
it
affected
him
felt
any
but
the
friendliest
of
feelings
toward
him
he
remembered
that
he
had
kept
her
from
the
necessity
of
adjusting
to
matrimony
with
the
lord
ghek
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
most
girls
intend
to
adjust
to
marriage
with
somebody
anyhow
and
he
did
not
even
suspect
that
it
is
a
feminine
instinct
to
make
a
highly
dramatic
and
romantic
production
of
their
marriage
so
they
have
something
to
be
sentimental
about
in
later
years
as
hoddan
drove
on
up
and
up
the
sky
became
deep
purple
and
then
black
velvet
set
with
flecks
of
fire
he
was
relieved
by
the
welcome
received
earlier
today
from
the
emigrants
but
he
remained
slightly
puzzled
by
a
very
faint
impression
of
desperation
remaining
he
felt
very
virtuous
on
the
whole
however
and
his
plans
for
the
future
were
specific
he
already
composed
a
letter
to
his
grandfather
which
ask
the
emigrant
fleet
to
deliver
he
had
another
letter
in
his
mind
a
form
letter
practically
a
circular
which
he
hoped
to
whip
into
shape
before
the
emigrants
got
too
anxious
to
be
on
their
way
he
considered
that
he
needed
to
earn
a
little
more
of
their
gratitude
so
he
could
make
everything
come
out
even
everybody
satisfied
and
happy
but
himself
for
himself
he
anticipated
only
the
deep
satisfaction
of
accomplishment
he
wanted
to
do
great
things
since
he
was
a
small
boy
and
in
electronics
since
his
adolescence
when
he
found
textbooks
in
the
libraries
of
looted
spaceships
he
gone
to
walden
in
the
hope
of
achievement
there
of
course
he
failed
because
in
a
free
economy
industrialists
consider
that
freedom
is
the
privilege
to
be
stupid
without
penalty
in
other
than
free
economies
of
course
stupidity
is
held
to
be
the
duty
of
administrators
but
hoddan
now
believed
himself
in
the
fascinating
situation
of
having
knowledge
and
abilities
which
were
needed
by
people
who
knew
their
need
it
was
only
when
he
made
contact
with
the
fleet
and
was
in
the
act
of
maneuvering
toward
a
on
the
liner
he
brought
back
that
doubts
again
assailed
him
he
had
done
a
few
things
accomplished
a
little
he
devised
a
receptor
and
a
microwave
projector
and
he
turned
a
lawlor
drive
into
a
ball
lightning
projector
and
worked
out
a
few
little
things
like
that
but
the
first
had
been
invented
before
by
somebody
in
the
cetis
cluster
and
the
second
could
have
been
made
by
anybody
and
the
third
was
standard
practice
on
zan
he
still
had
to
do
something
significant
when
he
made
fast
to
the
liner
and
crawled
through
the
to
its
hull
he
was
in
a
state
of
doubt
which
passed
very
well
for
modesty
the
bearded
old
man
received
him
in
the
skipper
quarters
which
hoddan
himself
had
occupied
for
a
few
days
he
looked
very
weary
he
seemed
to
have
aged
in
hours
we
grow
more
astounded
by
the
minute
he
told
hoddan
heavily
by
what
you
have
brought
us
ten
shiploads
like
this
and
we
would
be
better
equipped
than
we
believed
ourselves
in
the
beginning
it
looks
as
if
some
thousands
of
us
will
now
be
able
to
survive
our
colonization
of
the
planet
thetis
hoddan
gaped
at
him
the
old
man
put
his
hand
on
hoddan
shoulder
we
are
grateful
he
said
with
a
pathetic
attempt
at
warmth
please
do
not
doubt
that
it
is
only
that
that
you
had
to
accept
what
was
given
for
our
use
but
i
can
not
help
wishing
very
desperately
that
that
instead
of
unfamiliar
tools
for
and
machines
with
tapes
which
show
pictures
i
wish
that
even
one
more
had
been
included
hoddan
jaw
dropped
the
people
of
colin
wanted
machinery
they
wanted
it
so
badly
that
they
did
not
want
anything
else
they
could
not
even
see
that
anything
else
had
any
value
at
all
most
of
them
could
only
look
forward
to
starvation
when
the
ship
supplies
were
exhausted
because
not
enough
ground
could
be
broken
and
cultivated
early
enough
to
grow
food
enough
in
time
would
it
asked
the
old
man
desperately
be
possible
to
exchange
these
useless
machines
for
others
that
will
be
useful
l
let
me
talk
to
your
mechanics
sir
said
hoddan
unhappily
maybe
something
can
be
done
he
restrained
himself
from
tearing
his
hair
as
he
went
to
where
mechanics
of
the
fleet
looked
over
their
he
come
up
to
the
fleet
again
to
gloat
and
do
great
things
for
people
who
needed
him
and
knew
it
but
he
faced
the
hopelessness
of
people
to
whom
his
utmost
effort
seemed
mockery
because
it
was
so
far
from
being
enough
he
gathered
together
the
men
who
tried
to
keep
the
fleet
ships
in
working
order
during
their
flight
they
were
competent
men
of
course
they
were
resolute
but
now
they
had
given
up
hope
hoddan
began
to
lecture
them
they
needed
machines
he
had
brought
the
machines
they
wanted
perhaps
but
he
brought
the
machines
to
make
them
with
here
were
automatic
shapers
turret
lathes
dicers
here
were
for
machines
these
machines
could
make
to
make
the
machines
the
colony
on
thetis
would
require
he
brought
these
because
they
had
the
raw
material
they
had
their
ships
themselves
even
some
of
the
junk
they
carried
in
crates
was
good
metal
merely
worn
out
in
its
present
form
they
could
make
anything
they
needed
with
what
he
brought
them
for
example
he
show
them
how
to
make
say
a
lumber
saw
he
showed
them
how
to
make
a
lumber
saw
slender
rapierlike
revolving
tool
with
which
a
man
stabbed
a
tree
and
cut
outward
with
the
speed
of
a
knife
cutting
hot
butter
and
one
could
mount
it
so
and
cut
out
planks
and
beams
for
temporary
bridges
and
such
constructions
they
watched
baffled
they
gave
no
sign
of
hope
they
did
not
want
lumber
saws
they
wanted
machinery
i
brought
you
everything
he
insisted
you
got
a
civilization
compact
on
this
ship
you
got
life
instead
of
starvation
look
at
this
i
make
a
water
pump
to
irrigate
your
fields
before
their
eyes
he
turned
out
an
irrigation
pump
on
an
automatic
shaper
he
showed
them
that
the
shaper
went
on
by
itself
making
other
pumps
without
further
instructions
than
the
control
of
the
tools
that
formed
the
first
the
mechanics
stirred
uneasily
they
had
watched
without
comprehension
now
they
listened
without
enthusiasm
their
eyes
were
like
those
of
children
who
watch
marvels
without
comprehension
he
made
a
sledge
whose
runners
slid
on
air
between
themselves
and
whatever
object
would
otherwise
have
touched
them
it
was
practically
frictionless
he
made
a
machine
to
make
nails
utterly
simple
he
made
a
power
hammer
which
hummed
and
pushed
nails
into
any
object
that
needed
to
be
nailed
he
made
he
stopped
abruptly
and
sat
down
with
his
head
in
his
hands
the
people
of
the
fleet
faced
so
overwhelming
a
catastrophe
that
they
could
not
see
into
it
they
could
only
experience
it
as
their
leader
would
have
been
unable
to
answer
questions
about
the
fleet
predicament
before
poured
out
the
tale
in
the
form
it
had
taken
in
his
mind
now
these
mechanics
were
unable
to
see
ahead
they
were
paralyzed
by
the
completeness
of
the
disaster
before
them
they
could
live
until
the
supplies
of
the
fleet
gave
out
they
could
not
grow
fresh
supplies
without
machinery
they
had
to
have
machinery
they
could
not
imagine
wanting
anything
less
than
machinery
hoddan
raised
his
head
the
mechanics
looked
dully
at
him
you
men
do
maintenance
he
asked
you
repair
things
when
they
wear
out
on
the
ships
have
you
run
out
of
some
materials
you
need
for
repairs
after
a
long
time
a
man
said
slowly
on
the
ship
i
come
from
we
having
trouble
our
hydroponic
garden
keeps
the
air
fresh
but
the
pipes
are
gone
rusted
through
we
have
got
any
pipe
to
fix
them
with
we
have
to
keep
the
water
moving
with
buckets
hoddan
got
up
he
looked
about
him
he
had
brought
pipe
supplies
and
there
was
no
raw
material
he
took
a
pair
of
power
snips
and
cut
away
a
section
of
cargo
space
he
cut
it
into
strips
he
asked
the
diameter
of
the
pipe
before
their
eyes
he
made
pipe
spirally
wound
around
a
mandril
and
to
solidity
i
need
some
of
that
on
my
ship
said
another
man
the
bearded
man
said
heavily
we
make
some
and
send
it
to
the
ships
that
need
it
no
said
hoddan
we
send
the
tools
to
make
it
we
can
make
the
tools
here
there
must
be
other
kinds
of
repairs
that
ca
be
made
with
the
machines
i
brought
we
make
the
tools
to
make
the
repairs
machines
have
reels
that
show
exactly
how
to
do
it
illustration
it
was
a
new
idea
the
mechanics
had
other
and
immediate
problems
beside
the
overall
disaster
of
the
fleet
pumps
that
did
not
work
motors
that
heated
up
they
could
envision
the
meeting
of
those
problems
and
they
could
envision
the
obtaining
of
but
they
could
not
imagine
anything
in
between
they
were
capable
of
learning
how
to
make
tools
for
repairs
hoddan
taught
them
in
one
day
there
were
five
ships
being
brought
into
better
operating
condition
for
ultimate
futility
because
of
what
brought
two
days
three
mechanics
began
to
come
to
the
liner
those
who
learned
first
pompously
passed
on
what
they
knew
on
the
fourth
day
somebody
began
to
use
a
machine
to
get
information
on
a
fine
point
in
welding
on
the
fifth
day
there
were
lines
of
men
waiting
to
use
them
on
the
sixth
day
a
mechanic
on
what
had
been
a
luxury
passenger
liner
on
the
other
side
of
the
galaxy
but
it
was
scores
of
years
ago
asked
to
talk
to
hoddan
by
spacephone
he
been
working
feverishly
at
the
minor
repairs
he
been
unable
to
make
for
so
long
to
get
material
he
pulled
a
crate
off
one
of
the
junk
machines
supplied
the
fleet
he
looked
it
over
he
believed
that
if
this
piece
were
made
new
and
that
replaced
with
sound
metal
the
machine
might
be
usable
hoddan
had
him
come
to
the
liner
which
was
now
the
flagship
of
the
fleet
discussion
began
shaping
such
large
pieces
of
metal
which
could
be
taken
from
here
or
there
shaping
such
large
pieces
of
metal
hoddan
began
to
draw
diagrams
they
were
not
clear
he
drew
more
abruptly
he
stared
at
what
he
outlined
electronics
he
saw
something
remarkable
if
one
applied
a
perfectly
bit
of
information
that
nobody
bothered
with
he
finished
the
diagram
and
a
vast
soothing
satisfaction
came
over
him
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
he
said
not
enough
room
he
looked
about
him
insensibly
as
he
talked
to
the
first
man
on
the
fleet
to
show
imagination
other
men
had
gathered
around
they
were
now
absorbed
i
think
said
hoddan
that
we
can
make
an
electronic
field
soften
the
cementite
between
the
crystals
of
steel
without
heating
up
anything
else
if
it
works
we
can
make
and
with
plastic
dies
and
then
that
useless
junk
you
got
can
be
rebuilt
they
listened
gravely
nodding
as
he
talked
they
did
not
quite
understand
everything
but
they
had
the
habit
of
believing
him
now
he
needed
this
and
that
in
the
huge
cargo
spaces
of
the
ship
the
leader
had
formerly
used
said
hoddan
how
about
duplicating
these
machines
and
sending
them
over
they
looked
estimatingly
at
the
equipment
it
could
be
made
to
duplicate
itself
the
new
machine
shop
in
the
ancient
ark
of
space
made
another
machine
shop
for
another
ship
in
the
other
ship
that
tool
shop
would
make
another
for
another
ship
which
in
turn
by
then
hoddan
had
a
in
operation
it
was
very
large
it
drew
on
the
big
ship
drive
unit
for
power
one
put
a
rough
mass
of
steel
in
place
between
plastic
dies
one
turned
on
the
power
for
the
tenth
of
a
second
no
longer
the
steel
was
soft
as
putty
then
it
stiffened
and
was
warm
but
in
that
tenth
of
a
second
it
had
been
shaped
with
precision
it
took
two
days
to
duplicate
the
hoddan
had
first
been
shown
in
new
sound
metal
but
after
the
first
one
worked
triumphantly
they
made
forty
of
each
part
at
a
time
and
turned
out
equipment
enough
for
the
subjugation
of
all
thetis
forests
there
were
other
enterprises
on
hand
of
course
a
mechanic
who
stuttered
horribly
had
an
idea
he
could
not
explain
it
or
diagram
it
so
he
made
it
it
was
an
electric
motor
very
far
ahead
of
those
in
the
machines
of
colin
hoddan
waked
from
a
cat
nap
with
a
diagram
in
his
head
he
drew
it
and
later
looked
and
found
that
his
unconscious
mind
had
designed
a
system
which
made
look
rather
primitive
during
the
first
six
days
hoddan
did
not
sleep
to
speak
of
and
after
that
he
merely
when
he
could
but
he
finally
agreed
with
the
emigrants
leader
now
no
longer
fierce
but
fiercely
triumphant
that
he
thought
they
could
go
on
and
he
would
ask
a
favor
he
propped
his
eyelids
open
with
his
fingers
and
wrote
the
letter
to
his
grandfather
that
he
composed
in
his
mind
in
the
liner
on
krim
he
managed
to
make
one
copy
unaddressed
of
the
letter
that
he
worked
out
at
the
same
time
he
put
it
through
a
facsimile
machine
and
managed
to
address
each
of
fifty
copies
then
he
yawned
uncontrollably
he
still
yawned
when
he
went
to
take
leave
of
the
leader
of
the
people
of
colin
that
person
regarded
him
with
warm
eyes
i
think
everything
all
right
said
hoddan
exhaustedly
you
got
a
dozen
machine
shops
and
they
are
multiplying
themselves
and
you
have
got
some
enthusiastic
mechanics
now
who
drinking
in
the
stuff
and
finding
out
more
than
they
guessed
there
was
and
thinking
now
and
then
for
themselves
i
think
you
make
out
the
bearded
man
said
humbly
i
have
waited
until
you
said
all
was
well
will
you
come
with
us
said
hoddan
he
yawned
again
i
got
my
work
here
an
obligation
i
have
to
meet
it
must
be
very
admirable
work
said
the
old
man
wistfully
i
wish
we
had
some
young
men
like
you
among
us
you
have
said
hoddan
they
will
be
giving
you
trouble
presently
the
old
man
shook
his
head
looking
at
hoddan
very
affectionately
indeed
we
will
deliver
your
letters
he
said
warmly
first
to
krim
and
then
to
walden
then
we
will
go
on
and
let
down
your
letter
and
gift
to
your
grandfather
on
zan
then
we
will
go
on
toward
thetis
our
mechanics
will
work
at
building
machines
while
we
are
in
overdrive
but
also
they
will
build
new
tool
shops
and
train
new
mechanics
so
that
every
so
often
we
will
need
to
come
out
of
overdrive
to
transfer
the
tools
and
the
men
to
new
ships
hoddan
nodded
exhaustedly
this
was
right
so
said
the
old
man
contentedly
we
will
simply
make
those
transfers
in
orbit
about
the
planets
for
which
we
have
your
letters
but
you
will
pardon
us
if
we
only
let
down
your
letters
and
do
not
visit
those
planets
we
have
prejudices
perfectly
satisfactory
said
hoddan
so
i
the
mechanics
you
have
trained
said
the
old
man
proudly
have
made
a
little
ship
ready
for
you
it
is
not
much
larger
than
your
spaceboat
but
it
is
fit
for
travel
between
suns
which
will
be
convenient
for
your
work
i
hope
you
will
accept
it
there
is
even
a
tiny
tool
shop
on
it
hoddan
would
have
been
more
touched
if
he
had
known
about
it
but
one
of
the
men
entrusted
with
the
job
had
harassedly
asked
him
for
advice
he
knew
what
he
was
getting
it
was
the
space
yacht
he
used
before
refurbished
and
fitted
with
everything
the
emigrants
could
provide
he
affected
great
surprise
and
expressed
unfeigned
appreciation
barely
an
hour
later
he
transferred
to
it
with
the
spaceboat
in
tow
he
watched
the
emigrant
fleet
swing
out
to
emptiness
and
resume
its
valiant
journey
but
it
was
not
a
hopeless
journey
now
in
fact
the
colony
on
thetis
ought
to
start
out
than
most
settled
planets
and
he
went
to
sleep
he
nothing
urgent
to
do
except
allow
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
pass
before
he
did
anything
he
was
exhausted
he
slept
the
clock
around
and
waked
and
ate
sluggishly
and
went
back
to
sleep
again
on
the
whole
the
cosmos
did
not
notice
the
difference
stars
flamed
in
emptiness
and
planets
rotated
sedately
on
their
axes
comets
flung
out
gossamer
veils
or
retracted
them
and
space
liners
went
about
upon
their
lawful
occasions
and
lovers
swore
by
stars
and
moons
often
quite
different
stars
and
moons
and
various
things
happened
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
hoddan
but
when
he
waked
again
he
was
rested
and
he
reviewed
all
his
actions
and
his
situation
it
appeared
that
matters
promised
fairly
well
on
the
emigrant
fleet
now
gone
forever
they
would
remember
hoddan
with
affection
for
a
year
or
so
and
dimly
after
that
but
settling
a
new
world
would
be
enthralling
and
important
work
nobody
think
of
him
at
all
after
a
certain
length
of
time
but
he
had
to
think
of
an
obligation
he
assumed
on
their
account
he
considered
his
own
affairs
he
told
fani
he
was
going
to
marry
nedda
the
way
things
looked
that
was
no
longer
so
probable
of
course
in
a
year
or
two
or
a
few
years
he
might
be
out
from
under
the
obligations
he
now
considered
due
in
time
even
the
waldenian
government
would
realize
that
deathrays
do
exist
and
a
lawyer
might
be
able
to
clear
things
for
his
return
to
walden
but
nedda
was
a
nice
girl
he
frowned
that
was
it
she
was
a
remarkably
nice
girl
but
hoddan
suddenly
doubted
if
she
were
a
delightful
one
he
found
himself
questioning
that
she
was
exactly
and
perfectly
what
his
ambitions
described
he
tried
to
imagine
spending
his
declining
years
with
nedda
he
could
quite
picture
it
as
exciting
she
did
tend
to
be
a
little
insipid
presently
gloomy
and
a
trifle
dogged
about
it
he
brought
the
spaceboat
around
to
the
modernized
boatport
of
the
yacht
he
got
into
it
leaving
the
yacht
in
orbit
he
headed
down
toward
darth
now
that
he
rested
he
had
work
to
do
which
could
not
be
neglected
to
carry
out
that
work
he
needed
a
crew
able
and
willing
to
pass
for
pirates
for
a
pay
and
there
were
innumerable
castles
on
darth
with
quite
as
many
shiftly
noblemen
and
certainly
no
fewer
darthian
gentlemen
hanging
around
them
but
don
loris
castle
had
one
real
advantage
and
one
which
existed
only
in
hoddan
mind
don
loris
retainers
did
know
that
hoddan
had
led
their
companions
to
loot
large
loot
he
have
less
trouble
and
more
enthusiastic
support
from
don
loris
retainers
than
any
other
this
was
true
the
illusion
was
that
the
lady
fani
was
his
firm
personal
friend
with
no
nonsense
about
her
this
was
a
very
great
mistake
he
landed
for
the
fourth
time
outside
don
loris
castle
this
time
he
had
no
men
to
march
to
the
castle
and
act
as
heralds
of
his
presence
the
spaceboat
visionscreens
showed
don
loris
stronghold
as
immense
dark
and
menacing
banners
flew
from
its
turrets
their
colors
bright
in
the
ruddy
light
of
the
gate
remained
closed
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
sign
that
his
landing
had
been
noted
then
there
was
movement
on
the
battlements
and
a
figure
began
to
descend
outside
the
wall
it
was
lowered
to
the
ground
by
a
long
rope
it
reached
the
ground
and
shook
itself
it
marched
toward
the
spaceboat
through
the
red
and
nearly
level
rays
of
the
dying
sun
hoddan
watched
with
a
frown
on
his
face
this
was
a
retainer
of
don
loris
it
assuredly
was
fani
he
could
even
make
out
its
gender
until
the
figure
was
very
near
then
he
looked
astonished
it
was
his
old
friend
derec
arrived
on
darth
a
long
while
since
in
the
spaceboat
hoddan
had
been
using
ever
since
derec
had
been
his
boon
companion
in
the
days
when
he
expected
to
become
rich
by
splendid
exploits
in
electronics
derec
was
also
the
character
who
conscientiously
told
the
cops
on
hoddan
when
they
found
his
sneaked
into
a
station
and
a
stray
corpse
coincidentally
outside
he
opened
the
boatport
and
stood
in
the
opening
derec
had
been
a
guest
anyhow
an
inhabitant
of
don
loris
castle
for
a
good
long
while
now
hoddan
wondered
if
he
considered
his
quarters
cozy
evening
derec
said
hoddan
cordially
you
looking
well
i
do
feel
it
said
derec
dismally
i
feel
like
a
fool
in
the
castle
yonder
and
the
high
police
official
i
came
here
with
has
gotten
grumpy
and
snaps
when
i
try
to
speak
to
him
hoddan
said
gravely
i
sure
the
lady
fani
a
tigress
said
derec
bitterly
we
do
get
along
looking
at
derec
hoddan
found
himself
able
to
understand
why
derec
was
the
sort
of
friend
one
might
make
on
walden
for
lack
of
something
better
he
was
he
might
be
capable
of
splendid
things
even
heroism
but
he
was
horribly
terribly
appallingly
civilized
well
well
said
hoddan
kindly
and
what
on
your
mind
derec
i
came
said
derec
dismally
to
plead
with
you
again
bron
you
must
surrender
there
nothing
else
to
do
people
ca
have
deathrays
bron
above
all
you
must
tell
the
pirates
how
to
make
them
hoddan
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
he
realized
that
information
about
the
fleet
came
from
the
spearmen
he
brought
back
loaded
down
with
cash
derec
had
noticed
the
absence
of
the
flashing
lights
at
sunset
or
had
realized
that
they
meant
the
fleet
was
gone
away
said
hoddan
why
do
you
think
i
already
done
it
because
they
have
killed
you
said
derec
don
loris
pointed
that
out
he
does
believe
you
know
how
to
make
deathrays
he
says
not
a
secret
anybody
would
be
willing
for
anybody
else
to
know
but
you
know
the
truth
bron
you
killed
that
poor
man
back
on
walden
you
got
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
humanity
you
be
treated
kindly
hoddan
shook
his
head
it
seemed
somehow
very
startling
for
derec
to
be
harping
on
that
same
idea
after
so
many
things
had
happened
to
hoddan
but
he
did
think
derec
would
actually
expect
him
to
yield
to
persuasion
there
must
be
something
else
derec
might
even
have
nerved
himself
up
to
something
quite
desperate
what
did
you
really
come
here
for
derec
to
beg
you
to
then
in
one
instant
derec
made
an
hysterical
gesture
and
hummed
a
small
object
left
derec
hand
as
his
muscles
convulsed
from
the
bolt
it
did
not
fly
quite
true
it
fell
a
foot
or
so
to
one
side
of
the
boatport
instead
of
inside
it
exploded
luridly
as
derec
crumpled
from
the
pistol
bolt
there
was
thick
strangling
smoke
hoddan
disappeared
when
the
thickest
smoke
drifted
away
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
derec
lying
on
the
ground
and
thinner
smoke
drifting
out
of
the
boatport
nearly
half
an
hour
later
figures
came
very
cautiously
toward
the
spaceboat
thal
was
their
leader
his
expression
was
mournful
and
depressed
other
brawny
retainers
came
uncertainly
behind
him
at
a
nod
from
thal
two
of
them
picked
up
derec
and
carted
him
off
toward
the
castle
i
guess
he
got
it
said
thal
dismally
he
peered
in
he
shook
his
head
wounded
maybe
and
crawled
off
to
die
he
peered
in
again
and
shook
his
head
once
more
no
sign
of
a
spearman
just
behind
thal
said
dirty
trick
i
was
with
him
to
walden
and
he
paid
off
good
a
good
man
shoulda
been
a
chieftain
good
man
thal
entered
the
spaceboat
gingerly
he
wrinkled
his
nose
at
the
faint
smell
of
explosive
still
inside
another
man
came
in
another
say
said
one
of
them
in
a
conspiratorial
voice
we
got
our
share
of
that
loot
from
walden
but
he
hadda
share
too
what
he
do
with
it
he
could
kept
it
in
this
boat
here
we
could
take
a
quick
look
what
don
loris
do
know
do
hurt
him
i
going
to
find
hoddan
first
said
thal
with
dignity
we
have
to
carry
him
outside
so
don
loris
knows
we
looking
for
loot
but
i
going
to
find
him
first
there
were
other
men
in
the
spaceboat
now
a
full
dozen
of
them
their
spears
were
very
much
in
the
way
the
boat
door
closed
quietly
don
loris
retainers
stared
at
each
other
the
grumbled
for
half
a
second
sealing
the
door
tightly
don
loris
retainers
began
to
babble
protestingly
there
was
a
roaring
outside
the
spaceboat
stirred
the
roaring
rose
to
thunder
the
boat
lurched
it
flung
the
spearmen
into
a
sprawling
swearing
terrified
heap
at
the
rear
end
of
the
boat
interior
the
boat
went
on
out
to
space
again
in
the
control
room
hoddan
said
dourly
to
himself
i
in
a
rut
i
got
to
figure
out
some
way
to
ship
a
pirate
crew
without
having
to
kidnap
them
this
is
getting
monotonous
xi
there
was
a
disturbing
air
which
was
shared
by
all
the
members
of
hoddan
crew
on
the
way
to
walden
it
was
not
exactly
reluctance
because
there
was
enthusiasm
over
the
idea
of
making
a
pirate
voyage
under
him
so
far
as
past
enterprises
were
concerned
hoddan
as
a
leader
was
the
answer
to
a
darthian
gentleman
prayer
the
partial
looting
of
ghek
castle
alone
would
have
made
him
a
desirable
leader
but
a
crew
of
seven
returned
from
space
had
displayed
currency
which
amounted
to
the
wealth
of
fabled
ind
nobody
knew
what
ind
was
any
longer
but
it
was
a
synonym
for
fabulous
and
uncountable
riches
when
men
went
off
with
hoddan
they
came
back
rich
but
nevertheless
there
was
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
atmosphere
in
the
renovated
yacht
they
transshipped
from
the
spaceboat
to
the
yacht
through
lifeboat
tubes
and
they
were
quite
docile
about
it
because
none
of
them
knew
how
to
get
back
to
ground
hoddan
left
the
spaceboat
with
a
triggerable
set
for
use
on
his
return
he
done
a
similar
thing
off
krim
he
drove
the
little
yacht
well
out
until
darth
was
only
a
spotted
ball
with
visible
clouds
and
ice
caps
then
he
lined
up
for
walden
direct
and
went
into
overdrive
within
hours
he
noted
the
disturbing
feel
of
things
his
followers
were
not
happy
they
moped
they
sat
in
corners
and
submerged
themselves
in
misery
large
massive
men
with
drooping
blond
mustaches
ideal
characters
for
the
roles
of
pirates
tended
to
squeeze
tears
out
of
their
eyes
at
odd
moments
when
the
ship
was
twelve
hours
on
its
way
the
atmosphere
inside
it
was
funereal
the
spearmen
did
not
even
gorge
themselves
on
the
food
with
which
the
yacht
was
stocked
and
when
a
darthian
gentleman
lost
his
appetite
something
had
to
be
wrong
he
called
thal
into
the
control
room
what
the
matter
with
the
gang
he
demanded
vexedly
they
look
at
me
as
if
i
broken
all
their
hearts
do
they
want
to
go
back
thal
heaved
a
sigh
indicating
depression
beside
which
suicidal
mania
would
be
hilarity
he
said
pathetically
we
can
not
go
back
we
can
not
ever
return
to
darth
we
are
lost
men
doomed
to
wander
forever
among
strangers
or
to
float
as
corpses
between
the
stars
what
happened
demanded
hoddan
i
taking
you
on
a
pirate
cruise
where
the
loot
should
be
a
lot
better
than
last
time
thal
wept
hoddan
astonishedly
regarded
his
whiskery
countenance
contorted
with
grief
and
dampened
with
tears
it
happened
at
the
castle
said
thal
miserably
the
man
derec
from
walden
had
thrown
a
bomb
at
you
you
seemed
to
be
dead
but
don
loris
was
not
sure
he
fretted
as
he
does
he
wished
to
send
someone
to
make
sure
the
lady
fani
said
will
make
sure
she
called
me
to
her
and
said
will
you
fight
for
me
and
there
was
don
loris
suddenly
nodding
beside
her
so
i
said
my
lady
fani
then
she
said
you
i
am
troubled
by
bron
hoddan
so
what
could
i
do
she
said
the
same
thing
to
each
of
us
and
each
of
us
had
to
say
that
he
would
fight
for
her
to
each
she
said
that
she
was
troubled
by
you
then
don
loris
sent
us
out
to
look
at
your
body
and
now
we
are
disgraced
hoddan
mouth
opened
and
closed
and
opened
again
he
remembered
this
item
of
darthian
etiquette
if
a
girl
asked
a
man
if
he
would
fight
for
her
and
he
agreed
then
within
a
day
and
a
night
he
had
to
fight
the
man
she
sent
him
to
fight
or
else
he
was
disgraced
and
disgrace
on
darth
meant
that
the
shamed
man
could
be
plundered
or
killed
by
anybody
who
chose
to
do
so
but
he
would
be
hanged
by
indignant
authority
if
he
resisted
it
was
a
great
deal
worse
than
outlawry
it
included
scorn
and
contempt
and
opprobrium
it
meant
dishonor
and
humiliation
and
admitted
degradation
a
disgraced
man
was
despicable
in
his
own
eyes
and
hoddan
had
kidnaped
these
men
who
been
forced
to
engage
themselves
to
fight
him
and
if
they
killed
him
they
would
obviously
die
in
space
and
if
they
did
they
be
ashamed
to
stay
alive
the
moral
tone
on
darth
was
probably
not
elevated
but
etiquette
was
a
force
hoddan
thought
it
over
he
looked
up
suddenly
some
of
them
he
said
wryly
probably
figure
there
nothing
to
do
but
go
through
with
it
eh
yes
said
thal
dismally
then
we
will
all
die
said
hoddan
the
obligation
is
to
fight
if
you
fail
to
kill
me
that
not
your
fault
is
it
if
you
conquered
you
in
the
clear
thal
said
miserably
true
too
true
when
a
man
is
conquered
he
is
conquered
his
conqueror
may
plunder
him
when
the
matter
is
finished
or
he
can
spare
him
when
he
may
never
fight
his
conqueror
again
draw
your
knife
said
hoddan
come
at
me
thal
bewilderedly
made
the
gesture
hoddan
leveled
a
and
said
you
conquered
you
came
at
me
with
your
knife
and
i
shot
you
with
my
it
all
over
right
thal
gaped
at
him
then
he
beamed
he
expanded
he
gloated
he
frisked
he
practically
wagged
a
nonexistent
tail
in
his
exuberance
he
been
shown
an
out
when
he
could
see
none
send
in
the
others
one
by
one
said
hoddan
i
take
care
of
them
but
thal
why
did
the
lady
fani
want
me
killed
thal
had
no
idea
but
he
did
not
care
hoddan
did
care
he
was
bewildered
and
inclined
to
be
indignant
a
noble
friendship
like
theirs
a
spearman
came
in
and
saluted
hoddan
went
through
a
symbolic
duel
which
was
plainly
the
way
the
thing
would
have
happened
in
reality
others
came
in
and
went
through
the
same
process
two
of
them
did
not
quite
grasp
that
it
was
a
ritual
and
he
had
to
shoot
them
in
the
knife
arm
then
he
hunted
in
the
ship
supplies
for
ointment
for
the
blisters
that
would
appear
from
bolts
at
such
short
range
as
he
bandaged
the
places
he
again
tried
to
find
out
why
the
lady
fani
had
tried
to
get
him
carved
up
by
the
knives
all
darthian
gentlemen
wore
nobody
could
enlighten
him
but
the
atmosphere
improved
remarkably
since
each
theoretic
fight
had
taken
place
in
private
nobody
was
obliged
to
admit
a
compromise
with
etiquette
hoddan
followers
ceased
to
brood
they
developed
huge
appetites
those
who
had
been
aground
on
krim
told
zestfully
of
the
monstrous
hangovers
they
acquired
there
it
appeared
that
hoddan
was
revered
for
the
size
of
the
benders
he
enabled
his
followers
to
hang
on
but
there
remained
the
fact
that
the
lady
fani
had
tried
to
get
him
massacred
he
puzzled
over
it
the
little
yacht
sped
through
space
toward
walden
he
tried
to
think
how
he
offended
fani
he
could
think
of
nothing
he
set
to
work
on
a
new
electronic
setup
which
would
make
still
another
modification
of
the
lawlor
possible
in
the
others
groups
of
electronic
components
were
cut
out
and
others
substituted
in
rather
tricky
fashion
from
the
control
board
this
was
trickiest
of
all
it
required
the
vacuum
tube
to
burn
steadily
when
in
use
but
it
was
a
very
simple
idea
lawlor
drive
and
landing
grid
force
fields
were
formed
by
not
dissimilar
generators
and
ball
lightning
force
fields
were
in
the
same
general
family
of
phenomena
suppose
one
made
the
field
generator
that
had
to
be
on
a
ship
if
it
was
to
drive
at
all
capable
of
all
those
allied
associated
similar
force
fields
if
a
ship
could
make
the
fields
that
landing
grids
did
it
should
be
useful
to
pirates
hoddan
present
errand
was
neither
pure
nor
simple
piracy
but
piracy
it
would
be
the
more
he
considered
the
obligation
he
taken
on
himself
when
he
helped
the
the
more
he
doubted
that
he
could
lift
it
without
long
struggle
he
was
preparing
to
carry
on
that
struggle
for
a
long
time
he
more
or
less
resigned
himself
to
the
postponement
of
his
personal
desires
nedda
for
example
he
quite
sure
perhaps
after
all
but
time
passed
and
he
finished
his
electronic
job
he
came
out
of
overdrive
and
made
his
observations
and
corrected
his
course
finally
there
came
a
moment
when
the
fiery
ball
which
was
walden
sun
shone
brightly
in
the
vision
plates
it
writhed
and
spun
in
the
vast
silence
of
emptiness
illustration
hoddan
drove
to
a
point
still
above
the
limit
of
walden
he
interestedly
switched
on
the
control
which
made
his
manufacture
force
fields
he
groped
for
walden
and
felt
the
peculiar
rigidity
of
the
ship
when
the
field
took
hold
somewhere
underground
he
made
an
adjustment
and
felt
the
ship
respond
instead
of
pulling
a
ship
to
ground
in
the
setup
he
made
the
new
fields
pulled
the
ground
toward
the
ship
when
he
reversed
the
adjustment
instead
of
pushing
the
ship
away
to
empty
space
the
new
field
pushed
the
planet
there
was
no
practical
difference
of
course
the
effect
was
simply
that
the
space
yacht
now
carried
its
own
landing
grid
it
could
descend
anywhere
and
ascend
from
anywhere
without
using
rockets
moreover
it
could
hover
without
using
power
hoddan
was
pleased
he
took
the
yacht
down
to
a
bare
altitude
he
stopped
it
there
it
was
highly
satisfactory
he
made
quite
certain
that
everything
worked
as
it
should
then
he
made
a
call
on
the
space
communicator
calling
ground
said
hoddan
calling
ground
pirate
ship
calling
ground
he
waited
for
an
answer
now
he
find
out
the
result
of
very
much
effort
and
planning
he
was
apprehensive
of
course
there
was
much
responsibility
on
his
shoulders
there
was
the
liner
he
captured
and
looted
and
given
to
the
emigrants
there
were
his
followers
on
the
yacht
now
enthusiastically
sharpening
their
knife
blades
in
expectation
of
loot
he
owed
these
people
something
for
an
instant
he
thought
of
the
lady
fani
and
wondered
how
he
could
make
reparation
to
her
for
whatever
had
hurt
her
feelings
so
she
try
to
get
his
throat
cut
a
whining
bitterly
unhappy
voice
came
to
him
ship
said
the
voice
plaintively
received
the
warning
please
state
where
you
intend
to
descend
and
we
will
take
measures
to
prevent
disorder
repeat
please
state
where
you
intend
to
descend
and
we
will
take
measures
to
prevent
disorder
hoddan
drew
a
sharp
breath
of
relief
he
named
a
spot
a
residential
small
city
some
forty
miles
from
the
planetary
capital
he
set
his
controls
for
a
very
gradual
descent
he
went
out
to
where
his
followers
made
grisly
zinging
noises
where
they
honed
their
knives
we
land
said
hoddan
sternly
in
about
of
an
hour
you
will
go
ashore
and
loot
in
parties
of
not
less
than
three
thal
you
will
be
ship
guard
and
receive
the
plunder
and
make
sure
that
nobody
from
walden
gets
on
board
you
will
not
waste
time
committing
atrocities
on
the
population
he
went
back
to
the
control
room
he
turned
to
bands
and
listened
to
the
broadcasts
down
below
emergency
bulletin
boomed
a
voice
are
landing
in
the
city
of
ensfield
forty
miles
from
walden
city
the
population
is
instructed
to
evacuate
immediately
leaving
all
action
to
the
police
repeat
the
population
will
evacuate
ensfield
leaving
all
action
to
the
police
take
nothing
with
you
take
nothing
with
you
leave
at
hoddan
nodded
approvingly
the
voice
boomed
again
emergency
bulletin
pirates
are
landing
evacuate
take
nothing
with
you
leave
at
once
he
turned
to
another
channel
an
excited
voice
barked
seems
to
be
only
the
one
pirate
ship
which
has
been
located
hovering
in
an
unknown
manner
over
ensfield
we
are
rushing
camera
crews
to
the
spot
and
will
try
to
give
coverage
of
the
landing
of
pirates
on
walden
their
looting
of
the
city
of
ensfield
and
the
traffic
jams
inevitable
in
the
departure
of
the
citizens
before
the
pirate
ship
touches
ground
for
background
information
on
this
the
most
exciting
event
in
planetary
history
i
take
you
to
our
editorial
another
voice
took
over
instantly
will
be
remembered
that
some
days
since
the
gigantic
pirate
fleet
then
overhead
sent
down
a
communication
to
the
planetary
government
warning
that
single
ships
would
appear
to
loot
and
giving
notice
that
any
resistance
hoddan
felt
a
contented
glow
the
emigrant
fleet
had
most
faithfully
carried
out
its
leader
promise
to
let
down
a
letter
from
space
while
in
orbit
around
walden
the
emigrants
of
course
did
not
know
the
contents
of
the
letter
they
would
not
send
anybody
down
to
ground
because
of
the
temptations
to
sin
in
societies
other
than
their
own
blithely
and
cheerfully
and
dutifully
they
would
give
the
appearance
of
monstrous
piratical
strength
they
would
awe
walden
thoroughly
and
then
they
go
on
faithfully
leaving
similar
letters
and
similar
impressions
on
krim
and
lohala
and
tralee
and
famagusta
and
throughout
the
coalsack
stars
until
the
stock
of
addressed
missives
ran
out
they
would
perform
this
kindly
act
out
of
gratitude
to
hoddan
and
every
planet
they
visited
would
be
left
with
the
impression
that
the
fleet
overhead
was
that
of
bloodthirsty
who
would
presently
send
single
ships
to
collect
loot
which
must
be
yielded
without
resistance
such
looting
expeditions
were
to
be
looked
for
regularly
and
must
be
submitted
to
under
penalty
of
unthinkable
retribution
from
the
monster
fleet
of
space
now
as
the
yacht
descended
on
walden
it
represented
that
mythical
but
impressive
piratical
empire
of
hoddan
contrivance
he
listened
with
genuine
pleasure
to
the
broadcasts
when
low
enough
he
even
picked
up
the
pictures
of
highways
thronged
with
fugitives
from
the
town
he
saw
waldenian
police
directing
the
traffic
of
flight
he
saw
other
traffic
heading
toward
the
city
walden
was
the
most
highly
civilized
planet
in
the
nurmi
cluster
and
its
citizens
had
had
no
worries
at
all
except
about
tranquilizers
to
enable
them
to
stand
it
when
something
genuinely
exciting
turned
up
they
wanted
to
be
there
to
see
it
the
yacht
descended
below
the
clouds
hoddan
turned
on
an
emergency
flare
to
make
a
landing
by
sitting
in
the
control
room
he
saw
his
own
ship
as
the
broadcast
cameras
picked
it
up
and
relayed
it
to
millions
of
homes
he
was
impressed
it
was
a
glaring
eye
of
fierce
light
descending
deliberately
with
a
dark
and
mysterious
spacecraft
behind
it
he
heard
the
chattered
news
accounts
of
the
happening
he
saw
the
people
who
had
not
left
ensfield
joined
by
avid
visitors
he
saw
all
of
them
held
back
by
police
who
frantically
shepherded
them
away
from
the
area
in
which
the
pirates
should
begin
their
horrid
work
hoddan
even
watched
pleasurably
from
his
control
room
as
the
broadcast
cameras
daringly
showed
the
actual
of
the
ship
the
dramatic
slow
opening
of
its
entrance
port
the
appearance
of
authentic
pirates
in
the
opening
armed
to
the
teeth
bristling
ferociously
glaring
about
them
at
the
streets
of
the
city
left
to
their
mercy
it
was
a
splendid
broadcast
hoddan
would
have
liked
to
stay
and
watch
all
of
it
but
he
had
work
to
do
he
had
to
supervise
the
pirate
raid
it
was
as
it
turned
out
simple
enough
looting
parties
of
three
pirates
each
moved
skulking
about
seeking
plunder
quaking
cameramen
dared
to
ask
them
in
shaking
voices
to
pose
for
the
news
cameras
it
was
a
request
no
darthian
gentleman
even
in
an
act
of
piracy
could
possibly
refuse
they
posed
making
pictures
of
malignant
ruffianism
commentators
adding
informed
comment
to
delectably
thrilling
pictures
observed
that
the
pirates
wore
darthian
costume
but
observed
crisply
that
this
did
not
mean
that
darth
as
an
entity
had
turned
pirate
but
only
that
some
of
her
citizens
had
joined
the
pirate
fleet
the
camera
crews
then
asked
apologetically
if
they
would
permit
themselves
to
be
broadcast
in
the
act
of
looting
growling
savagely
for
their
public
and
occasionally
adding
even
a
fiendish
ha
they
obliged
the
camera
crews
helped
pick
out
good
places
to
loot
for
the
sake
of
good
pictures
the
pirates
in
fine
dramatic
style
millions
watching
vision
sets
all
over
the
planet
shivered
in
delicious
horror
as
the
pirates
went
about
their
nefarious
enterprise
presently
the
press
of
onlookers
could
not
be
held
back
by
the
police
they
surrounded
the
pirates
some
greatly
daring
asked
for
autographs
girls
watched
them
with
round
frightened
fascinated
eyes
younger
men
found
it
vastly
thrilling
to
carry
burdens
of
loot
back
to
the
pirate
ship
for
them
thal
complained
hoarsely
that
the
ship
was
getting
overloaded
hoddan
ordered
greater
discrimination
but
his
pirates
by
this
time
were
in
the
position
of
directors
rather
than
looters
themselves
romantic
waldenian
admirers
smashed
windows
and
brought
them
treasure
for
the
reward
of
a
scowling
acceptance
hoddan
had
to
call
it
off
the
pirate
ship
was
loaded
it
was
then
the
center
of
an
agitated
excited
enthusiastic
crowd
he
called
back
his
men
one
party
of
three
did
not
return
he
took
two
others
and
fought
his
way
through
the
mob
he
found
the
trio
backed
against
a
wall
while
hysterically
adoring
girls
struggled
to
seize
scraps
of
their
garments
for
mementos
of
real
live
pirates
looting
a
waldenian
town
but
hoddan
got
them
back
to
the
ship
in
confusion
tending
toward
the
blushful
their
clothes
were
shreds
he
fought
a
way
clear
for
them
to
get
into
the
ship
he
fought
his
way
in
cheers
rose
from
the
onlookers
he
got
the
landing
port
shut
only
by
the
help
of
police
who
kept
pirate
fans
from
having
their
fingers
caught
in
its
closing
then
the
piratical
space
yacht
rose
swiftly
toward
the
stars
an
hour
later
there
was
barely
any
diminution
of
the
excitement
inside
the
ship
darthian
gentlemen
all
hoddan
followers
still
gazed
and
floated
over
the
plunder
tucked
everywhere
it
crowded
the
living
quarters
it
threatened
to
interfere
with
the
astrogation
of
the
ship
hoddan
came
out
of
the
control
room
and
was
annoyed
break
it
up
he
snapped
pack
that
stuff
away
somewhere
what
do
you
think
this
is
thal
gazed
at
him
abstractedly
not
quite
able
to
tear
his
mind
and
thoughts
from
this
completely
unimaginable
mass
of
plunder
then
intelligence
came
into
his
eyes
as
much
as
could
appear
there
he
grinned
suddenly
he
slapped
his
thigh
boys
he
gurgled
he
do
know
what
we
got
for
him
one
man
looked
up
two
they
beamed
they
got
to
their
feet
dripping
jewelry
thal
went
ponderously
to
one
of
the
two
owners
staterooms
the
yacht
contained
at
the
door
he
turned
expansively
she
came
to
the
port
he
said
exuberantly
and
said
we
were
clothes
like
they
wore
on
darth
did
we
come
from
there
i
said
we
did
then
she
said
did
we
know
somebody
named
bron
hoddan
on
darth
and
i
said
we
did
and
if
she
step
inside
the
ship
she
meet
you
and
here
she
is
he
unfastened
the
stateroom
door
which
had
been
barred
from
without
he
opened
it
he
looked
in
and
grabbed
and
pulled
at
something
hoddan
went
sick
with
apprehension
he
groaned
as
the
something
inside
the
stateroom
sobbed
and
yielded
thal
brought
nedda
out
into
the
saloon
of
the
yacht
her
nose
and
eyes
were
red
from
terrified
weeping
she
gazed
about
her
in
purest
despairing
horror
she
did
not
see
hoddan
for
a
moment
her
eyes
were
filled
with
the
brawny
mustachioed
piratical
figures
who
were
darthian
gentlemen
and
who
grinned
at
her
in
what
she
took
for
evil
gloating
she
wailed
hoddan
swallowed
with
much
difficulty
and
said
sickly
it
all
right
nedda
it
was
a
mistake
nothing
will
happen
to
you
you
quite
and
he
knew
with
desperate
certainty
that
it
was
true
safe
with
me
and
she
was
xii
hoddan
stopped
off
at
krim
by
landing
grid
to
consult
his
lawyers
he
felt
a
certain
amount
of
hope
of
good
results
from
his
raid
on
walden
but
he
was
desperate
about
nedda
once
she
was
confident
of
her
safety
under
his
protection
she
took
over
the
operation
of
the
spaceship
she
displayed
an
overwhelming
saccharinity
that
was
appalling
she
was
sweetness
and
light
among
criminals
who
respectfully
did
not
harm
her
and
she
sweetened
and
lightened
the
atmosphere
of
the
space
yacht
until
hoddan
followers
were
close
to
mutiny
it
ai
that
i
mind
her
being
a
nice
girl
one
of
his
mustachioed
darthians
explained
almost
tearfully
to
hoddan
but
she
wants
to
make
a
nice
girl
out
of
me
hoddan
himself
cringed
from
her
society
he
could
gladly
have
put
her
ashore
on
krim
with
ample
funds
to
return
to
walden
but
she
was
prettily
reproachfully
helpless
if
he
did
put
her
ashore
she
would
confide
her
kidnaping
and
the
lovely
behavior
of
the
pirates
until
nobody
would
believe
in
them
any
more
which
would
be
fatal
he
went
to
his
lawyers
brooding
the
news
astounded
him
the
emigrant
fleet
had
appeared
over
krim
on
the
way
to
walden
before
it
appeared
hoddan
affairs
had
been
prosperous
enough
right
after
his
previous
visit
news
had
come
of
the
daring
piratical
raid
which
captured
a
ship
off
walden
this
was
the
liner
hoddan
brought
in
to
krim
all
merchants
and
ship
owners
immediately
insured
all
vessels
and
goods
in
space
transit
at
much
higher
valuations
the
stocks
bought
on
hoddan
account
had
multiplied
in
value
obeying
his
instructions
his
lawyers
had
sold
them
out
and
held
a
pleasing
fortune
in
trust
for
hoddan
then
came
the
fleet
over
krim
with
its
letter
threatening
planetary
destruction
if
resistance
was
offered
to
single
ships
which
would
land
and
loot
later
on
it
seemed
that
all
commerce
was
at
the
mercy
of
space
marauders
companies
had
undertaken
to
indemnify
the
owners
of
ships
and
freight
in
emptiness
now
that
an
unprecedented
pirate
fleet
ranged
and
doubtless
ravaged
the
skyways
the
insurance
companies
ought
to
go
bankrupt
owners
of
stock
in
them
dumped
it
at
any
price
to
get
rid
of
it
in
accordance
with
hoddan
instructions
though
his
lawyers
had
faithfully
if
distastefully
bought
it
in
to
use
up
the
funds
available
they
had
to
buy
up
not
only
all
the
stock
of
all
the
companies
of
krim
but
all
stock
in
all
companies
owned
by
investors
on
krim
then
time
passed
and
ships
in
space
arrived
unmolested
in
port
cargoes
were
delivered
intact
insurers
observed
that
the
companies
had
not
collapsed
and
could
still
pay
off
if
necessary
they
continued
their
insurance
risk
companies
appeared
financially
sound
once
more
they
had
more
business
than
ever
and
no
more
claims
than
usual
suddenly
their
stocks
went
up
or
rather
what
people
were
willing
to
pay
for
them
went
up
because
hoddan
had
forbidden
the
sale
of
any
stock
after
the
pirate
fleet
appeared
now
he
asked
hopefully
if
he
could
reimburse
the
owners
of
the
ship
captured
off
walden
he
could
could
he
pay
them
even
the
profit
have
made
between
the
loss
of
their
ship
and
the
arrival
of
a
replacement
he
could
could
he
pay
off
the
shippers
of
rigellian
furs
and
jewelry
from
the
cetis
stars
and
the
owners
of
the
bulk
that
had
brought
so
good
a
price
on
krim
he
could
in
fact
he
had
the
insurance
companies
he
now
owned
lock
stock
and
barrel
had
already
paid
the
claims
on
the
ship
and
its
cargo
and
it
would
be
rather
officious
to
add
to
that
reimbursement
hoddan
was
abruptly
appalled
he
insisted
on
a
bonus
being
paid
regardless
which
his
lawyers
had
some
trouble
finding
a
legal
fiction
to
fit
then
he
brooded
over
his
position
he
was
a
business
man
he
had
expected
to
make
out
so
well
he
thought
to
have
to
labor
for
years
perhaps
to
make
good
the
injury
he
done
the
ship
owners
and
merchants
in
order
to
help
the
emigrants
from
colin
but
it
was
all
done
and
here
he
was
with
a
fortune
and
the
framework
of
a
burgeoning
financial
empire
he
did
like
it
gloomily
he
explained
matters
to
his
attorneys
they
pointed
out
that
he
had
a
duty
an
obligation
from
the
nature
of
his
unexpected
success
if
he
let
things
go
now
the
currently
thriving
business
of
risk
insurance
would
return
to
its
former
unimportance
his
companies
had
taken
on
extra
help
more
bookkeepers
and
accountants
worked
for
him
this
week
than
last
more
mail
clerks
secretaries
janitors
and
scrubwomen
even
more
vice
presidents
he
would
administer
a
serious
blow
to
the
economy
of
krim
if
he
caused
a
slackening
of
employment
by
letting
his
companies
go
to
pot
a
slackening
of
employment
would
cause
a
drop
in
retail
trade
an
increase
in
inventories
a
depression
in
industry
hoddan
thought
gloomily
of
his
grandfather
he
written
to
the
old
gentleman
and
the
emigrant
fleet
would
have
delivered
the
letter
he
could
disappoint
his
grandfather
he
morbidly
accepted
his
attorneys
advice
and
they
arranged
immediately
to
take
over
the
as
well
as
the
floors
of
the
building
their
offices
were
in
commerce
would
march
on
and
hoddan
headed
for
darth
he
had
to
return
his
crew
and
there
was
something
else
several
something
elses
he
arrived
in
that
and
put
his
yacht
in
a
listening
for
the
the
spaceboat
should
give
for
him
to
home
on
he
found
it
deep
within
the
of
darth
he
maneuvered
to
come
alongside
and
there
was
blinding
light
everywhere
alarms
rang
lights
went
out
instruments
registered
impossibilities
the
rockets
fired
crazily
and
the
whole
ship
reeled
then
a
voice
roared
out
of
the
communicator
and
deliver
surrender
and
y
be
allowed
to
go
to
ground
but
if
hesitate
i
hull
ye
and
heave
ye
out
to
space
without
a
spacesuit
hoddan
winced
stray
sparks
had
flown
about
everywhere
inside
the
space
yacht
a
ball
lightning
bolt
even
of
only
warning
size
makes
things
uncomfortable
when
it
strikes
hoddan
fingers
tingled
as
if
been
asleep
he
threw
on
the
transmitter
switch
and
said
annoyedly
hello
grandfather
this
is
bron
have
you
been
waiting
for
me
long
he
heard
his
grandfather
swear
disgustedly
not
long
later
a
badly
battered
blackened
scuffed
old
spacecraft
came
rolling
up
on
and
stopped
with
a
billowing
of
rocket
fumes
hoddan
threw
a
switch
and
used
the
landing
grid
field
he
used
on
walden
in
another
fashion
the
ships
came
together
with
fine
precision
to
he
heard
his
grandfather
swear
in
amazement
that
a
little
trick
i
worked
out
grandfather
said
hoddan
into
the
transmitter
come
aboard
i
pass
it
on
his
grandfather
presently
appeared
scowling
and
suspicious
his
eyes
shrewdly
examined
everything
including
the
loot
tucked
in
every
available
space
he
snorted
all
honestly
come
by
said
hoddan
morbidly
it
seems
i
got
a
license
to
steal
i
not
sure
what
to
do
with
it
his
grandfather
stared
at
a
placard
on
the
wall
it
said
archly
a
lady
is
present
nedda
had
put
it
up
said
his
grandfather
what
a
woman
doing
on
a
pirate
ship
that
what
your
letter
talked
about
they
get
on
said
hoddan
wincing
like
mice
you
had
mice
on
a
ship
have
you
come
in
the
control
room
and
i
explain
he
did
explain
up
to
the
point
where
his
arrangements
to
pay
back
for
a
ship
and
cargo
he
given
away
turned
into
a
runaway
success
and
now
he
was
responsible
for
the
employment
of
innumerable
bookkeepers
and
clerks
and
such
in
the
insurance
companies
he
come
to
own
there
was
also
the
fact
that
as
the
emigrant
fleet
went
on
some
fifty
more
planets
in
all
would
require
the
attention
of
pirate
ships
from
time
to
time
or
there
would
be
disillusionment
and
injury
to
the
economic
system
organization
said
his
grandfather
does
wonders
for
a
tender
conscience
like
you
got
what
else
hoddan
explained
the
matter
of
his
darthian
crew
don
loris
might
affect
to
consider
them
disgraced
because
they
had
cut
his
throat
hoddan
had
to
take
care
of
the
matter
and
there
was
nedda
fani
came
into
the
story
somehow
too
hoddan
grandfather
grunted
at
the
end
we
go
down
and
talk
to
this
don
loris
he
said
pugnaciously
dealt
with
his
kind
before
while
we
down
your
cousin
oliver
take
a
look
at
this
new
job
we
put
it
on
my
ship
how
about
the
time
down
below
never
land
long
after
daybreak
early
in
the
morning
people
ai
at
their
best
hoddan
looked
at
darth
rotating
deliberately
below
him
it
not
too
late
sir
he
said
will
you
follow
me
down
his
grandfather
nodded
briskly
took
another
comprehensive
look
at
the
loot
from
walden
and
crawled
back
through
the
tube
to
his
own
ship
so
it
was
not
too
long
after
dawn
in
that
when
a
sentry
on
the
battlements
of
don
loris
castle
felt
a
shadow
over
his
head
he
jumped
a
foot
and
stared
upward
then
his
hair
stood
up
on
end
and
almost
threw
his
steel
helmet
off
he
stared
unable
to
move
a
muscle
there
was
a
ship
above
him
it
was
not
a
large
ship
but
he
could
not
judge
of
such
matters
it
was
not
supported
by
rockets
it
should
have
been
falling
horribly
to
smash
him
under
its
weight
it
was
instead
it
floated
on
with
very
fine
precision
like
a
ship
being
landed
by
grid
and
settled
delicately
to
the
ground
some
fifty
yards
from
the
base
of
the
castle
wall
immediately
thereafter
there
was
a
muttering
roar
it
grew
to
a
howl
a
bellow
it
became
thunder
it
increased
from
that
to
a
noise
so
stupendous
that
it
ceased
altogether
to
be
heard
and
was
only
felt
as
a
battering
at
one
chest
when
it
ended
there
was
a
second
ship
resting
in
the
middle
of
a
very
large
scorched
place
close
by
the
first
neither
of
these
ships
was
a
spaceboat
the
silently
landed
vessel
which
was
the
smaller
of
the
two
was
several
times
the
sizes
of
the
only
spacecraft
ever
seen
on
darth
outside
the
spaceport
its
design
was
somehow
suggestive
of
a
yacht
the
other
larger
ship
was
blunt
and
soiled
and
with
patches
on
its
plating
here
and
there
a
landing
ramp
dropped
down
from
the
battered
craft
it
neatly
spanned
the
scorched
and
patch
of
soil
a
port
opened
men
came
out
following
a
jaunty
small
figure
with
belligerent
gray
whiskers
they
dragged
an
enigmatic
object
behind
them
hoddan
came
out
of
the
yacht
his
grandfather
said
waspishly
this
the
castle
he
waved
at
the
massive
pile
of
cut
gray
stone
with
walls
twenty
feet
thick
and
sixty
high
yes
sir
said
hoddan
snorted
his
grandfather
looks
flimsy
to
me
he
waved
his
hand
again
you
remember
your
cousins
familiar
nods
came
from
the
men
of
the
battered
ship
hoddan
had
seen
any
of
them
for
years
but
they
were
his
kin
they
wore
commonplace
workaday
garments
but
carried
weapons
slung
negligently
over
their
shoulders
they
dragged
the
cryptic
object
behind
them
without
particular
formation
or
apparent
discipline
but
somehow
they
looked
capable
hoddan
and
his
grandfather
strolled
to
the
castle
gate
their
companions
a
little
to
their
rear
they
came
to
the
gate
nothing
happened
nobody
challenged
there
was
the
feel
of
peevish
refusal
to
associate
with
persons
who
landed
in
spaceships
illustration
shall
we
hail
asked
hoddan
nah
snorted
his
grandfather
i
know
his
kind
make
him
make
the
advances
he
waved
to
his
descendents
open
it
up
somebody
casually
pulled
back
a
cover
and
reached
in
and
threw
switches
found
a
power
broadcast
unit
grunted
hoddan
grandfather
on
a
ship
we
took
hooked
it
to
the
ship
when
use
the
you
still
got
power
your
cousin
oliver
whipped
this
thing
up
to
use
it
the
enigmatic
object
made
a
spiteful
noise
the
castle
gate
shuddered
and
fell
halfway
from
its
hinges
the
thing
made
a
second
noise
stones
splintered
and
began
to
collapse
hoddan
admired
three
more
unpleasing
but
not
violently
loud
sounds
half
the
wall
on
either
side
of
the
gate
was
rubble
collapsing
partly
inside
and
partly
outside
the
proper
boundary
figures
began
to
wave
hysterically
from
the
battlements
grandfather
yawned
slightly
i
always
like
to
talk
to
people
he
observed
when
they
about
what
i
likely
to
do
to
them
instead
of
what
maybe
they
can
do
to
me
figures
appeared
on
the
ground
level
they
come
out
of
a
sally
port
to
one
side
they
were
even
extravagantly
cordial
when
hoddan
grandfather
admitted
that
it
might
be
convenient
to
talk
over
his
business
inside
the
castle
where
there
would
be
an
to
sit
in
presently
they
sat
beside
the
fireplace
in
the
great
hall
don
loris
jittering
shivered
next
to
hoddan
grandfather
the
lady
fani
appeared
and
defiant
she
walked
with
frigid
dignity
to
a
place
beside
her
father
hoddan
grandfather
regarded
her
with
a
wicked
estimating
gaze
not
bad
he
said
brightly
not
bad
at
all
then
he
turned
to
hoddan
those
retainers
coming
on
the
way
said
hoddan
he
was
not
happy
the
lady
fani
had
passed
her
eyes
over
him
exactly
as
if
he
did
not
exist
there
was
a
murmurous
noise
the
dozen
spearmen
came
marching
into
the
great
hall
they
carried
loot
it
dripped
on
the
floor
and
they
blandly
ignored
such
things
as
stray
golden
coins
rolling
off
away
from
them
inhabitants
of
the
castle
gazed
at
them
in
joyous
wonderment
nedda
came
with
them
the
lady
fani
made
a
very
slight
almost
imperceptible
movement
hoddan
said
desperately
fani
i
know
you
hate
me
though
i
ca
guess
why
but
here
a
thing
that
has
to
be
taken
care
of
we
made
a
raid
on
walden
where
the
loot
came
from
and
my
men
kidnaped
this
girl
her
name
is
nedda
and
brought
her
on
the
ship
as
a
present
to
me
because
she
admitted
that
she
knew
me
nedda
in
an
awful
fix
fani
alone
and
friendless
and
somebody
has
to
take
care
of
her
her
father
come
for
her
eventually
no
doubt
but
somebody
got
to
take
care
of
her
in
the
meantime
and
i
ca
do
it
hoddan
felt
hysterical
at
the
bare
idea
i
ca
the
lady
fani
looked
at
nedda
and
nedda
wore
the
brave
look
of
a
girl
so
determinedly
sweet
that
nobody
could
possibly
bear
it
i
very
sorry
said
nedda
bravely
that
i
been
the
cause
of
poor
bron
turning
pirate
and
getting
into
such
dreadful
trouble
i
cry
over
it
every
night
before
i
go
to
sleep
he
treated
me
as
if
i
were
his
sister
and
the
other
men
were
so
gentle
and
respectful
that
i
i
think
it
will
break
my
heart
when
they
are
punished
when
i
think
of
them
being
executed
with
all
that
dreadful
hopeless
formality
on
darth
said
the
lady
fani
practically
we
not
very
formal
about
such
things
just
cutting
somebody
throat
is
usually
enough
but
he
treated
you
like
a
sister
did
he
thal
thal
swallowed
he
been
beaming
a
moment
before
with
his
arms
full
of
silver
plate
jewelry
laces
and
other
bits
of
booty
from
the
town
of
ensfield
but
now
he
said
desperately
yes
lady
fani
but
not
the
way
treated
my
sister
my
sisters
lady
fani
bit
me
when
they
were
little
slapped
me
when
they
were
bigger
and
scorned
me
when
i
grew
up
i
fond
of
but
if
one
of
my
sisters
ever
lectured
me
because
i
was
refined
or
shook
a
finger
at
me
because
i
was
gentlemanly
lady
fani
strangled
her
there
was
a
certain
gleam
in
the
lady
fani
eye
as
she
said
warmly
to
hoddan
of
course
i
take
care
of
the
poor
thing
i
let
her
sleep
with
my
maids
and
i
sure
one
of
them
can
spare
clothes
for
her
to
wear
and
i
take
care
of
her
until
a
space
liner
comes
along
and
she
can
be
shipped
back
to
her
family
and
you
can
come
to
see
her
whenever
you
please
to
make
sure
she
all
right
hoddan
eyes
tended
to
grow
wild
his
grandfather
cleared
his
throat
loudly
hoddan
said
doggedly
you
fani
asked
each
of
my
men
if
they
fight
for
you
they
said
yes
you
sent
them
to
cut
my
throat
they
did
but
they
not
disgraced
i
want
that
clear
they
good
men
they
not
disgraced
for
failing
to
assassinate
me
of
course
they
are
conceded
the
lady
fani
sweetly
whoever
heard
of
such
a
thing
hoddan
wiped
his
forehead
don
loris
opened
his
mouth
fretfully
hoddan
grandfather
forestalled
him
you
heard
about
that
big
pirate
fleet
that
been
floating
around
these
parts
eh
it
my
grandson
i
run
a
squadron
of
it
for
him
wonderful
boy
my
grandson
bloodthirsty
crews
on
those
ships
but
they
love
that
boy
very
don
loris
caught
his
breath
very
interesting
he
likes
your
men
confided
hoddan
grandfather
used
them
twice
says
they
make
nice
pirates
he
going
to
give
them
and
cannon
like
the
one
that
smashed
your
gate
only
men
on
darth
with
guns
like
that
seize
the
spaceport
and
put
in
power
broadcast
and
make
sure
nobody
else
gets
run
the
country
your
men
love
it
love
that
boy
too
follow
him
anywhere
loot
don
loris
quivered
it
was
horribly
plausible
he
had
the
scheme
of
the
only
force
on
darth
himself
he
knew
his
men
tended
to
revere
hoddan
because
of
the
plunder
his
followers
seemed
always
to
acquire
don
loris
was
in
a
very
very
uncomfortable
situation
bored
men
from
the
battered
spacecraft
stood
about
his
great
hall
they
were
unimpressed
he
knew
that
they
at
least
were
casually
sure
that
they
could
bring
his
castle
down
about
his
ears
in
minutes
if
they
chose
but
if
my
men
don
loris
quavered
what
about
me
minor
problem
said
hoddan
grandfather
blandly
the
usual
thing
would
be
cut
your
throat
he
rose
decide
that
later
no
doubt
yes
bron
i
brought
back
my
men
growled
hoddan
and
nedda
taken
care
of
we
through
here
he
headed
abruptly
for
the
great
hall
farthest
door
his
grandfather
followed
him
briskly
and
the
negligent
armed
men
who
were
mostly
hoddan
first
and
second
cousins
came
after
them
outside
the
castle
hoddan
said
angrily
why
did
you
tell
such
a
preposterous
story
grandfather
it
not
preposterous
said
his
grandfather
sounds
like
fun
to
me
you
tired
now
bron
lots
of
responsibilities
and
such
take
a
rest
you
and
your
cousin
oliver
get
together
and
fix
those
new
gadgets
on
my
ship
i
take
the
other
boys
for
a
run
over
to
this
spaceport
town
the
boys
need
a
run
ashore
and
there
might
be
some
loot
your
grandmother
fond
of
homespun
i
try
to
pick
some
up
for
her
hoddan
shrugged
his
grandfather
was
a
law
unto
himself
hoddan
saw
his
cousins
bringing
horses
from
the
castle
stables
and
a
very
casual
group
went
riding
away
as
if
on
a
pleasure
excursion
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
thal
guided
them
for
the
rest
of
that
morning
and
part
of
the
afternoon
hoddan
and
his
cousin
oliver
worked
at
the
battered
ship
lawlor
drive
hoddan
was
pleased
with
his
cousin
respect
for
his
device
he
unfeignedly
admired
the
cannon
his
cousin
had
designed
presently
they
reminisced
about
their
childhood
it
was
pleasant
to
renew
family
ties
like
this
the
riders
came
back
about
sunset
there
were
extra
horses
with
loads
there
were
cheerful
shoutings
his
grandfather
came
into
hoddan
ship
brought
back
some
company
he
said
spaceliner
landed
while
we
were
there
friend
of
yours
on
it
congenial
fellow
bron
thinks
well
of
you
too
a
large
figure
followed
his
grandfather
in
a
large
figure
with
hair
the
amiable
and
relaxed
interstellar
ambassador
to
walden
horses
hoddan
he
said
wryly
i
want
a
chair
and
a
drink
i
traveled
a
good
many
to
see
you
and
it
necessary
after
all
i
been
talking
to
your
grandfather
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
hoddan
reservedly
his
cousin
oliver
brought
glasses
and
the
ambassador
buried
his
nose
in
his
and
said
in
satisfaction
that
good
capable
man
your
grandfather
i
watched
him
loot
that
town
beautifully
professional
job
he
got
some
homespun
sheets
for
your
grandmother
but
about
you
hoddan
sat
down
his
grandfather
puffed
and
was
silent
his
cousins
effaced
themselves
the
ambassador
waved
a
hand
i
started
here
he
observed
because
it
looked
to
me
like
you
were
running
wild
that
spacefleet
now
i
know
something
of
your
ability
i
thought
you
contrived
some
way
to
fake
it
i
knew
there
could
be
such
a
fleet
not
really
that
was
a
sound
job
you
did
with
the
emigrants
by
the
way
most
praiseworthy
and
the
point
was
that
if
you
ran
hogwild
with
a
faked
fleet
sooner
or
later
the
space
patrol
would
have
to
cut
you
down
to
size
and
you
were
doing
much
too
good
work
to
be
stopped
hoddan
blinked
satisfaction
said
the
ambassador
is
well
enough
but
satiety
is
death
walden
was
dying
on
its
feet
nobody
could
imagine
a
greater
satisfaction
than
curling
up
with
a
good
tranquilizer
you
ended
that
i
left
walden
the
day
after
your
ensfield
raid
young
men
were
already
trying
to
grow
mustaches
the
textile
mills
were
making
colored
felt
for
garments
jewelers
were
turning
out
pins
for
ornaments
darthian
knives
for
brooches
and
the
song
writers
had
eight
new
tunes
on
the
air
about
pirate
lovers
pirate
queens
and
dark
ships
that
roam
the
lanes
of
night
three
new
series
were
to
start
that
same
night
with
as
their
theme
and
one
of
them
claimed
to
be
based
on
your
life
better
make
them
pay
for
that
hoddan
in
short
walden
had
rediscovered
the
pleasure
to
be
had
by
taking
pains
to
make
a
fool
of
one
self
people
who
watched
that
raid
on
visionscreens
had
thrills
they
never
swap
for
tranquilizers
and
the
ones
who
actually
mixed
in
with
the
pirate
raiders
you
deserve
well
of
the
republic
hoddan
hoddan
said
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
said
now
your
grandfather
and
i
have
canvassed
the
situation
thoroughly
this
good
work
must
be
continued
diplomatic
service
has
been
worried
all
along
the
line
now
we
something
to
work
up
your
grandfather
will
expand
his
facilities
and
snatch
ships
land
and
loot
and
keep
piracy
flying
your
job
is
to
carry
on
the
insurance
business
the
ships
that
will
be
snatched
will
be
your
ships
of
course
no
interference
with
legitimate
commerce
the
will
be
paid
for
by
the
interplanetary
insurance
companies
you
in
time
probably
have
to
get
writers
to
do
scripts
for
them
but
not
right
away
you
continue
to
get
rich
but
there
no
harm
in
that
so
long
as
you
romance
and
adventure
and
to
a
galaxy
headed
for
decline
savages
will
not
invent
themselves
if
there
are
plenty
of
heroic
characters
of
your
making
to
slap
them
down
hoddan
said
painfully
i
like
working
on
electronic
gadgets
my
cousin
oliver
and
i
have
some
things
we
want
to
work
on
together
his
grandfather
snorted
one
of
the
cousins
came
in
from
outside
the
yacht
thal
followed
him
glowing
he
reported
the
looting
of
the
spaceport
town
and
don
loris
had
gone
into
a
tantrum
of
despair
because
nobody
seemed
able
to
make
headway
against
these
strangers
now
turned
about
and
issued
a
belated
invitation
to
hoddan
and
his
grandfather
and
their
guest
the
interstellar
ambassador
of
whom
learned
from
thal
to
dinner
at
the
castle
they
could
bring
their
own
guards
hoddan
would
have
refused
but
the
ambassador
and
his
grandfather
were
insistent
ultimately
he
found
himself
seated
drearily
at
a
long
table
in
a
room
lighted
by
very
smoky
torches
don
loris
jittering
displayed
a
sort
of
professional
conversational
charm
he
was
making
an
urgent
effort
to
overcome
the
bad
effect
of
past
actions
by
conversational
brilliance
the
lady
fani
sat
quietly
with
jewels
at
her
throat
she
looked
most
often
at
her
plate
the
talk
of
the
oldsters
became
profound
they
talked
administration
they
talked
practical
politics
they
talked
economics
the
lady
fani
looked
very
bored
as
the
talk
went
on
after
the
meal
was
over
don
loris
said
brightly
to
her
my
dear
we
must
be
tedious
young
hoddan
looks
uninterested
too
why
do
you
two
walk
on
the
battlements
and
talk
about
such
things
as
persons
your
age
find
interesting
hoddan
rose
gloomily
the
lady
fani
with
a
sigh
of
polite
resignation
rose
to
accompany
him
the
ambassador
said
suddenly
hoddan
i
forgot
to
tell
you
they
found
out
what
killed
that
man
outside
the
power
station
when
hoddan
showed
no
comprehension
the
ambassador
explained
the
man
your
friend
derec
thought
was
killed
by
deathrays
it
develops
that
he
gotten
a
terrific
load
on
drunk
you
know
and
climbed
a
tree
to
escape
the
pink
purple
and
green
he
thought
were
chasing
him
to
gore
him
he
climbed
too
high
a
branch
broke
and
he
fell
and
was
killed
i
take
it
up
with
the
court
when
i
get
back
to
walden
no
reason
to
lock
you
up
any
more
you
know
you
might
even
sell
the
power
board
on
using
your
receptor
now
thanks
said
hoddan
politely
he
added
don
loris
has
that
derec
and
a
cop
from
walden
here
now
tell
them
that
and
they
may
go
home
he
accompanied
the
lady
fani
to
the
battlements
the
stars
were
very
bright
they
strolled
remembering
his
darthians
he
felt
very
unpopular
what
was
that
the
ambassador
told
you
she
asked
he
explained
without
zest
he
added
morbidly
that
it
did
matter
he
could
go
back
to
walden
now
and
if
the
ambassador
was
right
he
could
even
accomplish
things
in
electronics
there
but
he
was
interested
it
was
odd
that
he
once
thought
such
things
would
make
him
happy
i
thought
said
the
lady
fani
in
gentle
melancholy
that
i
would
be
happier
with
you
dead
you
had
made
me
very
angry
no
no
matter
how
but
i
found
it
was
not
so
hoddan
fumbled
for
her
meaning
it
was
quite
an
apology
for
trying
to
get
him
killed
but
at
least
it
was
a
disclaimer
of
future
intentions
in
that
direction
and
speaking
of
happiness
she
added
in
a
different
tone
this
nedda
he
shuddered
and
she
said
i
talked
to
her
so
then
i
sent
for
ghek
we
on
perfectly
good
terms
again
you
know
i
introduced
him
to
nedda
she
was
vanilla
ice
cream
with
meringue
and
maple
syrup
on
it
he
loved
it
she
gazed
at
him
with
pretty
sadness
and
told
him
how
terrible
it
was
of
him
to
kidnap
me
he
said
humbly
that
he
never
had
her
ennobling
influence
nor
dreamed
that
she
existed
and
she
loved
that
they
go
together
like
strawberries
and
cream
i
had
to
leave
or
stop
being
a
lady
i
think
i
made
a
match
then
she
said
tranquilly
but
seriously
you
ought
to
be
perfectly
happy
you
everything
you
ever
said
you
wanted
except
a
delightful
girl
to
marry
hoddan
squirmed
we
old
friends
said
fani
kindly
and
you
did
me
a
great
favor
once
i
return
it
i
round
up
some
really
delightful
girls
for
you
to
look
over
i
leaving
said
hoddan
alarmed
the
only
thing
is
i
do
know
what
type
you
like
nedda
is
it
hoddan
shuddered
nor
i
said
fani
what
type
would
you
say
i
was
delightful
said
hoddan
hoarsely
the
lady
fani
stopped
and
looked
up
at
him
she
said
approvingly
i
hoped
that
word
would
occur
to
you
one
day
er
what
does
a
man
usually
do
when
he
discovers
a
girl
is
delightful
hoddan
thought
it
over
he
started
he
put
his
arms
around
her
with
singularly
little
skill
he
kissed
her
at
first
as
if
amazed
at
himself
and
then
with
enthusiasm
there
were
scraping
sounds
on
the
stone
nearby
footsteps
don
loris
appeared
gazing
uncertainly
about
fani
he
said
plaintively
hoddan
our
guests
are
going
to
the
spaceships
i
want
to
speak
privately
to
hoddan
yes
said
hoddan
don
loris
peered
blindly
about
he
kissed
fani
again
i
been
thinking
said
don
loris
fretfully
i
made
some
mistakes
my
dear
boy
and
i
given
you
excellent
reason
to
dislike
me
but
at
bottom
i
always
thought
a
great
deal
of
you
and
ah
there
seems
to
be
only
one
way
in
which
i
can
properly
express
how
much
i
admire
you
ah
how
would
you
like
to
marry
my
daughter
hoddan
looked
down
at
fani
she
did
not
try
to
move
away
what
do
you
think
of
the
idea
fani
he
asked
how
about
marrying
me
tomorrow
morning
of
course
not
said
fani
indignantly
i
would
think
of
such
a
thing
i
could
possibly
get
married
before
tomorrow
