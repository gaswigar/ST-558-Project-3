part
i
i
in
the
days
when
new
york
traffic
moved
at
the
pace
of
the
drooping
when
society
applauded
christine
nilsson
at
the
academy
of
music
and
basked
in
the
sunsets
of
the
hudson
river
school
on
the
walls
of
the
national
academy
of
design
an
inconspicuous
shop
with
a
single
was
intimately
and
favourably
known
to
the
feminine
population
of
the
quarter
bordering
on
stuyvesant
square
it
was
a
very
small
shop
in
a
shabby
basement
in
a
already
doomed
to
decline
and
from
the
miscellaneous
display
behind
the
and
the
brevity
of
the
sign
surmounting
it
merely
bunner
sisters
in
blotchy
gold
on
a
black
ground
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
the
uninitiated
to
guess
the
precise
nature
of
the
business
carried
on
within
but
that
was
of
little
consequence
since
its
fame
was
so
purely
local
that
the
customers
on
whom
its
existence
depended
were
almost
congenitally
aware
of
the
exact
range
of
goods
to
be
found
at
bunner
sisters
the
house
of
which
bunner
sisters
had
annexed
the
basement
was
a
private
dwelling
with
a
brick
front
green
shutters
on
weak
hinges
and
a
sign
in
the
window
above
the
shop
on
each
side
of
its
modest
three
stories
stood
higher
buildings
with
fronts
of
brown
stone
cracked
and
blistered
balconies
and
behind
twisted
railings
these
houses
too
had
once
been
private
but
now
a
cheap
lunchroom
filled
the
basement
of
one
while
the
other
announced
itself
above
the
knotty
wistaria
that
clasped
its
central
balcony
as
the
mendoza
family
hotel
it
was
obvious
from
the
chronic
cluster
of
at
its
and
the
blurred
surface
of
its
curtainless
windows
that
the
families
frequenting
the
mendoza
hotel
were
not
exacting
in
their
tastes
though
they
doubtless
indulged
in
as
much
fastidiousness
as
they
could
afford
to
pay
for
and
rather
more
than
their
landlord
thought
they
had
a
right
to
express
these
three
houses
fairly
exemplified
the
general
character
of
the
street
which
as
it
stretched
eastward
rapidly
fell
from
shabbiness
to
squalor
with
an
increasing
frequency
of
projecting
and
of
swinging
doors
that
softly
shut
or
opened
at
the
touch
of
men
and
pale
little
girls
with
broken
jugs
the
middle
of
the
street
was
full
of
irregular
depressions
well
adapted
to
retain
the
long
swirls
of
dust
and
straw
and
twisted
paper
that
the
wind
drove
up
and
down
its
sad
untended
length
and
toward
the
end
of
the
day
when
traffic
had
been
active
the
fissured
pavement
formed
a
mosaic
of
coloured
lids
of
old
shoes
and
banana
skins
cemented
together
by
a
layer
of
mud
or
veiled
in
a
powdering
of
dust
as
the
state
of
the
weather
determined
the
sole
refuge
offered
from
the
contemplation
of
this
depressing
waste
was
the
sight
of
the
bunner
sisters
window
its
panes
were
always
and
though
their
display
of
artificial
flowers
bands
of
scalloped
flannel
wire
and
jars
of
preserves
had
the
undefinable
greyish
tinge
of
objects
long
preserved
in
the
of
a
museum
the
window
revealed
a
background
of
orderly
counters
and
walls
in
pleasant
contrast
to
the
adjoining
dinginess
the
bunner
sisters
were
proud
of
the
neatness
of
their
shop
and
content
with
its
humble
prosperity
it
was
not
what
they
had
once
imagined
it
would
be
but
though
it
presented
but
a
shrunken
image
of
their
earlier
ambitions
it
enabled
them
to
pay
their
rent
and
keep
themselves
alive
and
out
of
debt
and
it
was
long
since
their
hopes
had
soared
higher
now
and
then
however
among
their
greyer
hours
there
came
one
not
bright
enough
to
be
called
sunny
but
rather
of
the
silvery
twilight
hue
which
sometimes
ends
a
day
of
storm
it
was
such
an
hour
that
ann
eliza
the
elder
of
the
firm
was
soberly
enjoying
as
she
sat
one
january
evening
in
the
back
room
which
served
as
bedroom
kitchen
and
parlour
to
herself
and
her
sister
evelina
in
the
shop
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
down
the
counters
cleared
and
the
wares
in
the
window
lightly
covered
with
an
old
sheet
but
the
remained
unlocked
till
evelina
who
had
taken
a
parcel
to
the
dyer
should
come
back
in
the
back
room
a
kettle
bubbled
on
the
stove
and
ann
eliza
had
laid
a
cloth
over
one
end
of
the
centre
table
and
placed
near
the
sewing
lamp
two
two
plates
a
and
a
piece
of
pie
the
rest
of
the
room
remained
in
a
greenish
shadow
which
discreetly
veiled
the
outline
of
an
mahogany
bedstead
surmounted
by
a
chromo
of
a
young
lady
in
a
who
clung
with
eyes
to
a
crag
described
in
illuminated
letters
as
the
rock
of
ages
and
against
the
unshaded
windows
two
and
a
were
silhouetted
on
the
dusk
ann
eliza
her
small
and
habitually
anxious
face
smoothed
to
unusual
serenity
and
the
streaks
of
pale
hair
on
her
veined
temples
shining
glossily
beneath
the
lamp
had
seated
herself
at
the
table
and
was
tying
up
with
her
usual
fumbling
deliberation
a
knobby
object
wrapped
in
paper
now
and
then
as
she
struggled
with
the
string
which
was
too
short
she
fancied
she
heard
the
click
of
the
and
paused
to
listen
for
her
sister
then
as
no
one
came
she
straightened
her
spectacles
and
entered
into
renewed
conflict
with
the
parcel
in
honour
of
some
event
of
obvious
importance
she
had
put
on
her
and
black
silk
age
while
bestowing
on
this
garment
a
patine
worthy
of
a
renaissance
bronze
had
deprived
it
of
whatever
curves
the
wearer
figure
had
once
been
able
to
impress
on
it
but
this
stiffness
of
outline
gave
it
an
air
of
sacerdotal
state
which
seemed
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
occasion
seen
thus
in
her
sacramental
black
silk
a
wisp
of
lace
turned
over
the
collar
and
fastened
by
a
mosaic
brooch
and
her
face
smoothed
into
harmony
with
her
apparel
ann
eliza
looked
ten
years
younger
than
behind
the
counter
in
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
it
would
have
been
as
difficult
to
guess
her
approximate
age
as
that
of
the
black
silk
for
she
had
the
same
worn
and
glossy
aspect
as
her
dress
but
a
faint
tinge
of
pink
still
lingered
on
her
like
the
reflection
of
sunset
which
sometimes
colours
the
west
long
after
the
day
is
over
when
she
had
tied
the
parcel
to
her
satisfaction
and
laid
it
with
furtive
accuracy
just
opposite
her
sister
plate
she
sat
down
with
an
air
of
indifference
in
one
of
the
near
the
window
and
a
moment
later
the
opened
and
evelina
entered
the
younger
bunner
sister
who
was
a
little
taller
than
her
elder
had
a
more
pronounced
nose
but
a
weaker
slope
of
mouth
and
chin
she
still
permitted
herself
the
frivolity
of
waving
her
pale
hair
and
its
tight
little
ridges
stiff
as
the
tresses
of
an
assyrian
statue
were
flattened
under
a
dotted
veil
which
ended
at
the
tip
of
her
nose
in
her
scant
jacket
and
skirt
of
black
cashmere
she
looked
singularly
nipped
and
faded
but
it
seemed
possible
that
under
happier
conditions
she
might
still
warm
into
relative
youth
why
ann
eliza
she
exclaimed
in
a
thin
voice
pitched
to
chronic
fretfulness
what
in
the
world
you
got
your
best
silk
on
for
ann
eliza
had
risen
with
a
blush
that
made
her
spectacles
incongruous
why
evelina
why
should
i
i
like
to
know
ai
it
your
birthday
dear
she
put
out
her
arms
with
the
awkwardness
of
habitually
repressed
emotion
evelina
without
seeming
to
notice
the
gesture
threw
back
the
jacket
from
her
narrow
shoulders
oh
pshaw
she
said
less
peevishly
i
guess
we
better
give
up
birthdays
much
as
we
can
do
to
keep
christmas
you
had
oughter
say
that
evelina
we
ai
so
badly
off
as
all
that
i
guess
you
cold
and
tired
set
down
while
i
take
the
kettle
off
it
right
on
the
she
pushed
evelina
toward
the
table
keeping
a
sideward
eye
on
her
sister
listless
movements
while
her
own
hands
were
busy
with
the
kettle
a
moment
later
came
the
exclamation
for
which
she
waited
why
ann
eliza
evelina
stood
transfixed
by
the
sight
of
the
parcel
beside
her
plate
ann
eliza
tremulously
engaged
in
filling
the
teapot
lifted
a
look
of
hypocritical
surprise
sakes
evelina
what
the
matter
the
younger
sister
had
rapidly
untied
the
string
and
drawn
from
its
wrappings
a
round
nickel
clock
of
the
kind
to
be
bought
for
a
oh
ann
eliza
how
could
you
she
set
the
clock
down
and
the
sisters
exchanged
agitated
glances
across
the
table
well
the
elder
retorted
ai
it
your
birthday
yes
but
well
and
ai
you
had
to
run
round
the
corner
to
the
square
every
morning
rain
or
shine
to
see
what
time
it
was
ever
since
we
had
to
sell
mother
watch
last
july
ai
you
evelina
yes
but
there
ai
any
buts
we
always
wanted
a
clock
and
now
we
got
one
that
all
there
is
about
it
ai
she
a
beauty
evelina
ann
eliza
putting
back
the
kettle
on
the
stove
leaned
over
her
shoulder
to
pass
an
approving
hand
over
the
circular
rim
of
the
clock
hear
how
loud
she
ticks
i
was
afraid
you
hear
her
soon
as
you
come
no
i
was
thinking
murmured
evelina
well
ai
you
glad
now
ann
eliza
gently
reproached
her
the
rebuke
had
no
acerbity
for
she
knew
that
evelina
seeming
indifference
was
alive
with
unexpressed
scruples
i
real
glad
sister
but
you
had
oughter
we
could
have
got
on
well
enough
evelina
bunner
just
you
sit
down
to
your
tea
i
guess
i
know
what
i
oughter
and
what
i
had
oughter
just
as
well
as
you
do
i
old
enough
you
real
good
ann
eliza
but
i
know
you
given
up
something
you
needed
to
get
me
this
what
do
i
need
i
like
to
know
ai
i
got
a
best
black
silk
the
elder
sister
said
with
a
laugh
full
of
nervous
pleasure
she
poured
out
evelina
tea
adding
some
condensed
milk
from
the
jug
and
cutting
for
her
the
largest
slice
of
pie
then
she
drew
up
her
own
chair
to
the
table
the
two
women
ate
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
before
evelina
began
to
speak
again
the
clock
is
perfectly
lovely
and
i
do
say
it
ai
a
comfort
to
have
it
but
i
hate
to
think
what
it
must
have
cost
no
it
did
neither
ann
eliza
retorted
i
got
it
dirt
cheap
if
you
want
to
know
and
i
paid
for
it
out
of
a
little
extra
work
i
did
the
other
night
on
the
machine
for
the
there
i
knew
it
you
swore
to
me
you
buy
a
new
pair
of
shoes
with
that
well
and
i
did
want
what
then
i
patched
up
the
old
ones
as
good
as
new
and
i
do
declare
evelina
bunner
if
you
ask
me
another
question
you
go
and
spoil
all
my
very
well
i
wo
said
the
younger
sister
they
continued
to
eat
without
farther
words
evelina
yielded
to
her
sister
entreaty
that
she
should
finish
the
pie
and
poured
out
a
second
cup
of
tea
into
which
she
put
the
last
lump
of
sugar
and
between
them
on
the
table
the
clock
kept
up
its
sociable
tick
where
you
get
it
ann
eliza
asked
evelina
fascinated
where
you
why
right
round
here
over
acrost
the
square
in
the
queerest
little
store
you
ever
laid
eyes
on
i
saw
it
in
the
window
as
i
was
passing
and
i
stepped
right
in
and
asked
how
much
it
was
and
the
he
was
real
pleasant
about
it
he
was
just
the
nicest
man
i
guess
he
a
german
i
told
him
i
could
give
much
and
he
said
well
he
knew
what
hard
times
was
too
his
name
ramy
herman
ramy
i
saw
it
written
up
over
the
store
and
he
told
me
he
used
to
work
at
oh
for
years
in
the
and
three
years
ago
he
took
sick
with
some
kinder
fever
and
lost
his
place
and
when
he
got
well
they
engaged
somebody
else
and
did
want
him
and
so
he
started
this
little
store
by
himself
i
guess
he
real
smart
and
he
spoke
quite
like
an
educated
man
but
he
looks
evelina
was
listening
with
absorbed
attention
in
the
narrow
lives
of
the
two
sisters
such
an
episode
was
not
to
be
what
you
say
his
name
was
she
asked
as
ann
eliza
paused
herman
how
old
is
he
well
i
could
exactly
tell
you
he
looked
so
sick
but
i
he
much
over
by
this
time
the
plates
had
been
cleared
and
the
teapot
emptied
and
the
two
sisters
rose
from
the
table
ann
eliza
tying
an
apron
over
her
black
silk
carefully
removed
all
traces
of
the
meal
then
after
washing
the
cups
and
plates
and
putting
them
away
in
a
cupboard
she
drew
her
to
the
lamp
and
sat
down
to
a
heap
of
mending
evelina
meanwhile
had
been
roaming
about
the
room
in
search
of
an
for
the
clock
a
rosewood
with
ornamental
hung
on
the
wall
beside
the
devout
young
lady
in
dishabille
and
after
much
weighing
of
alternatives
the
sisters
decided
to
dethrone
a
broken
china
vase
filled
with
dried
grasses
which
had
long
stood
on
the
top
shelf
and
to
put
the
clock
in
its
place
the
vase
after
farther
consideration
being
relegated
to
a
small
table
covered
with
blue
and
white
beadwork
which
held
a
bible
and
and
an
illustrated
copy
of
longfellow
poems
given
as
a
to
their
father
this
change
having
been
made
and
the
effect
studied
from
every
angle
of
the
room
evelina
languidly
put
her
on
the
table
and
sat
down
to
the
monotonous
work
of
pinking
a
heap
of
black
silk
flounces
the
strips
of
stuff
slid
slowly
to
the
floor
at
her
side
and
the
clock
from
its
commanding
altitude
kept
time
with
the
dispiriting
click
of
the
instrument
under
her
fingers
ii
the
purchase
of
evelina
clock
had
been
a
more
important
event
in
the
life
of
ann
eliza
bunner
than
her
younger
sister
could
divine
in
the
first
place
there
had
been
the
demoralizing
satisfaction
of
finding
herself
in
possession
of
a
sum
of
money
which
she
need
not
put
into
the
common
fund
but
could
spend
as
she
chose
without
consulting
evelina
and
then
the
excitement
of
her
stealthy
trips
abroad
undertaken
on
the
rare
occasions
when
she
could
trump
up
a
pretext
for
leaving
the
shop
since
as
a
rule
it
was
evelina
who
took
the
bundles
to
the
dyer
and
delivered
the
purchases
of
those
among
their
customers
who
were
too
genteel
to
be
seen
carrying
home
a
bonnet
or
a
bundle
of
pinking
so
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
excuse
of
having
to
see
teething
baby
ann
eliza
would
hardly
have
known
what
motive
to
allege
for
deserting
her
usual
seat
behind
the
counter
the
infrequency
of
her
walks
made
them
the
chief
events
of
her
life
the
mere
act
of
going
out
from
the
monastic
quiet
of
the
shop
into
the
tumult
of
the
streets
filled
her
with
a
subdued
excitement
which
grew
too
intense
for
pleasure
as
she
was
swallowed
by
the
engulfing
roar
of
broadway
or
third
avenue
and
began
to
do
timid
battle
with
their
incessant
of
humanity
after
a
glance
or
two
into
the
great
she
usually
allowed
herself
to
be
swept
back
into
the
shelter
of
a
and
finally
regained
her
own
roof
in
a
state
of
breathless
bewilderment
and
fatigue
but
gradually
as
her
nerves
were
soothed
by
the
familiar
quiet
of
the
little
shop
and
the
click
of
evelina
certain
sights
and
sounds
would
detach
themselves
from
the
torrent
along
which
she
had
been
swept
and
she
would
devote
the
rest
of
the
day
to
a
mental
reconstruction
of
the
different
episodes
of
her
walk
till
finally
it
took
shape
in
her
thought
as
a
consecutive
and
experience
from
which
for
weeks
afterwards
she
would
detach
some
fragmentary
recollection
in
the
course
of
her
long
dialogues
with
her
sister
but
when
to
the
unwonted
excitement
of
going
out
was
added
the
intenser
interest
of
looking
for
a
present
for
evelina
ann
agitation
sharpened
by
concealment
actually
preyed
upon
her
rest
and
it
was
not
till
the
present
had
been
given
and
she
had
unbosomed
herself
of
the
experiences
connected
with
its
purchase
that
she
could
look
back
with
anything
like
composure
to
that
stirring
moment
of
her
life
from
that
day
forward
however
she
began
to
take
a
certain
tranquil
pleasure
in
thinking
of
ramy
small
shop
not
unlike
her
own
in
its
countrified
obscurity
though
the
layer
of
dust
which
covered
its
counter
and
shelves
made
the
comparison
only
superficially
acceptable
still
she
did
not
judge
the
state
of
the
shop
severely
for
ramy
had
told
her
that
he
was
alone
in
the
world
and
lone
men
she
was
aware
did
not
know
how
to
deal
with
dust
it
gave
her
a
good
deal
of
occupation
to
wonder
why
he
had
never
married
or
if
on
the
other
hand
he
were
a
widower
and
had
lost
all
his
dear
little
children
and
she
scarcely
knew
which
alternative
seemed
to
make
him
the
more
interesting
in
either
case
his
life
was
assuredly
a
sad
one
and
she
passed
many
hours
in
speculating
on
the
manner
in
which
he
probably
spent
his
evenings
she
knew
he
lived
at
the
back
of
his
shop
for
she
had
caught
on
entering
a
glimpse
of
a
dingy
room
with
a
tumbled
bed
and
the
pervading
smell
of
cold
fry
suggested
that
he
probably
did
his
own
cooking
she
wondered
if
he
did
not
often
make
his
tea
with
water
that
had
not
boiled
and
asked
herself
almost
jealously
who
looked
after
the
shop
while
he
went
to
market
then
it
occurred
to
her
as
likely
that
he
bought
his
provisions
at
the
same
market
as
evelina
and
she
was
fascinated
by
the
thought
that
he
and
her
sister
might
constantly
be
meeting
in
total
unconsciousness
of
the
link
between
them
whenever
she
reached
this
stage
in
her
reflexions
she
lifted
a
furtive
glance
to
the
clock
whose
loud
staccato
tick
was
becoming
a
part
of
her
inmost
being
the
seed
sown
by
these
long
hours
of
meditation
germinated
at
last
in
the
secret
wish
to
go
to
market
some
morning
in
evelina
stead
as
this
purpose
rose
to
the
surface
of
ann
eliza
thoughts
she
shrank
back
shyly
from
its
contemplation
a
plan
so
steeped
in
duplicity
had
never
before
taken
shape
in
her
crystalline
soul
how
was
it
possible
for
her
to
consider
such
a
step
and
besides
she
did
not
possess
sufficient
logic
to
mark
the
downward
trend
of
this
besides
what
excuse
could
she
make
that
would
not
excite
her
sister
curiosity
from
this
second
query
it
was
an
easy
descent
to
the
third
how
soon
could
she
manage
to
go
it
was
evelina
herself
who
furnished
the
necessary
pretext
by
awaking
with
a
sore
throat
on
the
day
when
she
usually
went
to
market
it
was
a
saturday
and
as
they
always
had
their
bit
of
steak
on
sunday
the
expedition
could
not
be
postponed
and
it
seemed
natural
that
ann
eliza
as
she
tied
an
old
stocking
around
evelina
throat
should
announce
her
intention
of
stepping
round
to
the
butcher
oh
ann
eliza
they
cheat
you
so
her
sister
wailed
ann
eliza
brushed
aside
the
imputation
with
a
smile
and
a
few
minutes
later
having
set
the
room
to
rights
and
cast
a
last
glance
at
the
shop
she
was
tying
on
her
bonnet
with
fumbling
haste
the
morning
was
damp
and
cold
with
a
sky
full
of
sulky
clouds
that
would
not
make
room
for
the
sun
but
as
yet
dropped
only
an
occasional
in
the
early
light
the
street
looked
its
meanest
and
most
neglected
but
to
ann
eliza
never
greatly
troubled
by
any
untidiness
for
which
she
was
not
responsible
it
seemed
to
wear
a
singularly
friendly
aspect
a
few
minutes
walk
brought
her
to
the
market
where
evelina
made
her
purchases
and
where
if
he
had
any
sense
of
topographical
fitness
ramy
must
also
deal
ann
eliza
making
her
way
through
the
outskirts
of
and
flabby
fish
found
no
one
in
the
shop
but
the
butcher
who
stood
in
the
background
cutting
chops
as
she
approached
him
across
the
tesselation
of
blood
and
he
laid
aside
his
cleaver
and
not
unsympathetically
asked
sister
sick
oh
not
very
jest
a
cold
she
answered
as
guiltily
as
if
illness
had
been
feigned
we
want
a
steak
as
usual
please
and
my
sister
said
you
was
to
be
sure
to
give
me
jest
as
good
a
cut
as
if
it
was
her
she
added
with
candour
oh
that
all
the
butcher
picked
up
his
weapon
with
a
grin
your
sister
knows
a
cut
as
well
as
any
of
us
he
remarked
in
another
moment
ann
eliza
reflected
the
steak
would
be
cut
and
wrapped
up
and
no
choice
left
her
but
to
turn
her
disappointed
steps
toward
home
she
was
too
shy
to
try
to
delay
the
butcher
by
such
conversational
arts
as
she
possessed
but
the
approach
of
a
deaf
old
lady
in
an
antiquated
bonnet
and
mantle
gave
her
her
opportunity
wait
on
her
first
please
ann
eliza
whispered
i
ai
in
any
the
butcher
advanced
to
his
new
customer
and
ann
eliza
palpitating
in
the
back
of
the
shop
saw
that
the
old
lady
hesitations
between
liver
and
pork
chops
were
likely
to
be
indefinitely
prolonged
they
were
still
unresolved
when
she
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
blowsy
irish
girl
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
the
newcomer
caused
a
momentary
diversion
and
when
she
had
departed
the
old
lady
who
was
evidently
as
intolerant
of
interruption
as
a
professional
insisted
on
returning
to
the
beginning
of
her
complicated
order
and
weighing
anew
with
an
anxious
appeal
to
the
butcher
arbitration
the
relative
advantages
of
pork
and
liver
but
even
her
hesitations
and
the
intrusion
on
them
of
two
or
three
other
customers
were
of
no
avail
for
ramy
was
not
among
those
who
entered
the
shop
and
at
last
ann
eliza
ashamed
of
staying
longer
reluctantly
claimed
her
steak
and
walked
home
through
the
thickening
snow
even
to
her
simple
judgment
the
vanity
of
her
hopes
was
plain
and
in
the
clear
light
that
disappointment
turns
upon
our
actions
she
wondered
how
she
could
have
been
foolish
enough
to
suppose
that
even
if
ramy
i
did
go
to
that
particular
market
he
would
hit
on
the
same
day
and
hour
as
herself
there
followed
a
colourless
week
unmarked
by
farther
incident
the
old
stocking
cured
evelina
throat
and
hawkins
dropped
in
once
or
twice
to
talk
of
her
baby
teeth
some
new
orders
for
pinking
were
received
and
evelina
sold
a
bonnet
to
the
lady
with
puffed
sleeves
the
lady
with
puffed
sleeves
a
resident
of
the
square
whose
name
they
had
never
learned
because
she
always
carried
her
own
parcels
home
was
the
most
distinguished
and
interesting
figure
on
their
horizon
she
was
youngish
she
was
elegant
as
the
title
they
had
given
her
implied
and
she
had
a
sweet
sad
smile
about
which
they
had
woven
many
histories
but
even
the
news
of
her
return
to
town
it
was
her
first
apparition
that
year
failed
to
arouse
ann
eliza
interest
all
the
small
daily
happenings
which
had
once
sufficed
to
fill
the
hours
now
appeared
to
her
in
their
deadly
insignificance
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
long
years
of
drudgery
she
rebelled
at
the
dullness
of
her
life
with
evelina
such
fits
of
discontent
were
habitual
and
openly
proclaimed
and
ann
eliza
still
excused
them
as
one
of
the
prerogatives
of
youth
besides
evelina
had
not
been
intended
by
providence
to
pine
in
such
a
narrow
life
in
the
original
plan
of
things
she
had
been
meant
to
marry
and
have
a
baby
to
wear
silk
on
sundays
and
take
a
leading
part
in
a
church
circle
hitherto
opportunity
had
played
her
false
and
for
all
her
superior
aspirations
and
carefully
crimped
hair
she
had
remained
as
obscure
and
unsought
as
ann
eliza
but
the
elder
sister
who
had
long
since
accepted
her
own
fate
had
never
accepted
evelina
once
a
pleasant
young
man
who
taught
in
had
paid
the
younger
miss
bunner
a
few
shy
visits
that
was
years
since
and
he
had
speedily
vanished
from
their
view
whether
he
had
carried
with
him
any
of
evelina
illusions
ann
eliza
had
never
discovered
but
his
attentions
had
clad
her
sister
in
a
halo
of
exquisite
possibilities
ann
eliza
in
those
days
had
never
dreamed
of
allowing
herself
the
luxury
of
it
seemed
as
much
a
personal
right
of
evelina
as
her
elaborately
crinkled
hair
but
now
she
began
to
transfer
to
herself
a
portion
of
the
sympathy
she
had
so
long
bestowed
on
evelina
she
had
at
last
recognized
her
right
to
set
up
some
lost
opportunities
of
her
own
and
once
that
dangerous
precedent
established
they
began
to
crowd
upon
her
memory
it
was
at
this
stage
of
ann
eliza
transformation
that
evelina
looking
up
one
evening
from
her
work
said
suddenly
my
she
ann
eliza
raising
her
eyes
from
a
brown
merino
seam
followed
her
sister
glance
across
the
room
it
was
a
monday
and
they
always
wound
the
clock
on
sundays
are
you
sure
you
wound
her
yesterday
evelina
jest
as
sure
as
i
live
she
must
be
broke
i
go
and
evelina
laid
down
the
hat
she
was
trimming
and
took
the
clock
from
its
shelf
there
i
knew
it
she
wound
jest
as
tight
what
you
happened
to
her
ann
eliza
i
dunno
i
sure
said
the
elder
sister
wiping
her
spectacles
before
proceeding
to
a
close
examination
of
the
clock
with
anxiously
bent
heads
the
two
women
shook
and
turned
it
as
though
they
were
trying
to
revive
a
living
thing
but
it
remained
unresponsive
to
their
touch
and
at
length
evelina
laid
it
down
with
a
sigh
seems
like
somethin
dead
do
it
ann
eliza
how
still
the
room
is
yes
ai
it
well
i
put
her
back
where
she
belongs
evelina
continued
in
the
tone
of
one
about
to
perform
the
last
offices
for
the
departed
and
i
guess
she
added
you
have
to
step
round
to
ramy
and
see
if
he
can
fix
ann
eliza
face
burned
i
yes
i
guess
i
have
to
she
stammered
stooping
to
pick
up
a
spool
of
cotton
which
had
rolled
to
the
floor
a
sudden
stretched
the
seams
of
her
flat
alpaca
bosom
and
a
pulse
leapt
to
life
in
each
of
her
temples
that
night
long
after
evelina
slept
ann
eliza
lay
awake
in
the
unfamiliar
silence
more
acutely
conscious
of
the
nearness
of
the
crippled
clock
than
when
it
had
volubly
told
out
the
minutes
the
next
morning
she
woke
from
a
troubled
dream
of
having
carried
it
to
ramy
and
found
that
he
and
his
shop
had
vanished
and
all
through
the
day
occupations
the
memory
of
this
dream
oppressed
her
it
had
been
agreed
that
ann
eliza
should
take
the
clock
to
be
repaired
as
soon
as
they
had
dined
but
while
they
were
still
at
table
a
little
girl
in
a
black
apron
stabbed
with
innumerable
pins
burst
in
on
them
with
the
cry
oh
miss
bunner
for
mercy
sake
miss
mellins
has
been
took
miss
mellins
was
the
upstairs
and
the
child
one
of
her
youthful
apprentices
ann
eliza
started
from
her
seat
i
come
at
once
quick
evelina
the
cordial
by
this
euphemistic
name
the
sisters
designated
a
bottle
of
cherry
brandy
the
last
of
a
dozen
inherited
from
their
grandmother
which
they
kept
locked
in
their
cupboard
against
such
emergencies
a
moment
later
cordial
in
hand
ann
eliza
was
hurrying
upstairs
behind
the
child
miss
mellins
turn
was
sufficiently
serious
to
detain
ann
eliza
for
nearly
two
hours
and
dusk
had
fallen
when
she
took
up
the
depleted
bottle
of
cordial
and
descended
again
to
the
shop
it
was
empty
as
usual
and
evelina
sat
at
her
in
the
back
room
ann
eliza
was
still
agitated
by
her
efforts
to
restore
the
but
in
spite
of
her
preoccupation
she
was
struck
as
soon
as
she
entered
by
the
loud
tick
of
the
clock
which
still
stood
on
the
shelf
where
she
had
left
it
why
she
going
she
gasped
before
evelina
could
question
her
about
miss
mellins
did
she
start
up
again
by
herself
oh
no
but
i
could
stand
not
knowing
what
time
it
was
i
got
so
accustomed
to
having
her
round
and
just
after
you
went
upstairs
hawkins
dropped
in
so
i
asked
her
to
tend
the
store
for
a
minute
and
i
clapped
on
my
things
and
ran
right
round
to
ramy
it
turned
out
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
her
nothin
a
speck
of
dust
in
the
works
and
he
fixed
her
for
me
in
a
minute
and
i
brought
her
right
back
ai
it
lovely
to
hear
her
going
again
but
tell
me
about
miss
mellins
quick
for
a
moment
ann
eliza
found
no
words
not
till
she
learned
that
she
had
missed
her
chance
did
she
understand
how
many
hopes
had
hung
upon
it
even
now
she
did
not
know
why
she
had
wanted
so
much
to
see
the
again
i
it
because
nothing
ever
happened
to
me
she
thought
with
a
twinge
of
envy
for
the
fate
which
gave
evelina
every
opportunity
that
came
their
way
she
had
the
teacher
too
ann
eliza
murmured
to
herself
but
she
was
in
the
arts
of
renunciation
and
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
pause
she
plunged
into
a
detailed
description
of
the
evelina
when
her
curiosity
was
roused
was
an
insatiable
questioner
and
it
was
before
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
enquiries
about
miss
mellins
but
when
the
two
sisters
had
seated
themselves
at
their
evening
meal
ann
eliza
at
last
found
a
chance
to
say
so
she
had
a
speck
of
dust
in
evelina
understood
at
once
that
the
reference
was
not
to
miss
mellins
yes
at
least
he
thinks
so
she
answered
helping
herself
as
a
matter
of
course
to
the
first
cup
of
tea
to
think
murmured
ann
eliza
but
he
is
sure
evelina
continued
absently
pushing
the
teapot
toward
her
sister
it
may
be
something
wrong
with
the
i
forget
what
he
called
it
anyhow
he
said
he
call
round
and
see
day
after
after
who
said
gasped
ann
eliza
why
ramy
of
course
i
think
he
real
nice
ann
eliza
and
i
do
believe
he
forty
but
he
does
look
sick
i
guess
he
pretty
lonesome
all
by
himself
in
that
store
he
as
much
as
told
me
so
and
somehow
evelina
paused
and
bridled
i
kinder
thought
that
maybe
his
saying
he
call
round
about
the
clock
was
just
an
excuse
he
said
it
just
as
i
was
going
out
of
the
store
what
you
think
ann
eliza
oh
i
do
to
save
herself
ann
eliza
could
produce
nothing
warmer
well
i
do
pretend
to
be
smarter
than
other
folks
said
evelina
putting
a
conscious
hand
to
her
hair
but
i
guess
herman
ramy
would
be
sorry
to
pass
an
evening
here
of
spending
it
all
alone
in
that
poky
little
place
of
her
irritated
ann
eliza
i
guess
he
got
plenty
of
friends
of
his
own
she
said
almost
harshly
no
he
ai
either
he
got
hardly
did
he
tell
you
that
too
even
to
her
own
ears
there
was
a
faint
sneer
in
the
interrogation
yes
he
did
said
evelina
dropping
her
lids
with
a
smile
he
seemed
to
be
just
crazy
to
talk
to
somebody
somebody
agreeable
i
mean
i
think
the
man
unhappy
ann
so
do
i
broke
from
the
elder
sister
he
seems
such
an
educated
man
too
he
was
reading
the
paper
when
i
went
in
ai
it
sad
to
think
of
his
being
reduced
to
that
little
store
after
being
years
at
and
one
of
the
head
men
in
their
he
told
you
all
that
why
yes
i
think
he
a
told
me
everything
ever
happened
to
him
if
i
had
the
time
to
stay
and
listen
i
tell
you
he
dead
lonely
ann
yes
said
ann
eliza
iii
two
days
afterward
ann
eliza
noticed
that
evelina
before
they
sat
down
to
supper
pinned
a
crimson
bow
under
her
collar
and
when
the
meal
was
finished
the
younger
sister
who
seldom
concerned
herself
with
the
clearing
of
the
table
set
about
with
nervous
haste
to
help
ann
eliza
in
the
removal
of
the
dishes
i
hate
to
see
food
mussing
about
she
grumbled
ai
it
hateful
having
to
do
everything
in
one
room
oh
evelina
i
always
thought
we
was
so
comfortable
ann
eliza
protested
well
so
we
are
comfortable
enough
but
i
do
suppose
there
any
harm
in
my
saying
i
wisht
we
had
a
parlour
is
there
anyway
we
might
manage
to
buy
a
screen
to
hide
the
ann
eliza
coloured
there
was
something
vaguely
embarrassing
in
evelina
suggestion
i
always
think
if
we
ask
for
more
what
we
have
may
be
taken
from
us
she
ventured
well
whoever
took
it
would
get
much
evelina
retorted
with
a
laugh
as
she
swept
up
the
a
few
moments
later
the
back
room
was
in
its
usual
flawless
order
and
the
two
sisters
had
seated
themselves
near
the
lamp
ann
eliza
had
taken
up
her
sewing
and
evelina
was
preparing
to
make
artificial
flowers
the
sisters
usually
relegated
this
more
delicate
business
to
the
long
leisure
of
the
summer
months
but
evelina
had
brought
out
the
box
which
lay
all
winter
under
the
bed
and
spread
before
her
a
bright
array
of
muslin
petals
yellow
stamens
and
green
corollas
and
a
tray
of
little
implements
curiously
suggestive
of
the
dental
art
ann
eliza
made
no
remark
on
this
unusual
proceeding
perhaps
she
guessed
why
for
that
evening
her
sister
had
chosen
a
graceful
task
presently
a
knock
on
the
outer
door
made
them
look
up
but
evelina
the
first
on
her
feet
said
promptly
sit
still
i
see
who
it
ann
eliza
was
glad
to
sit
still
the
baby
petticoat
that
she
was
stitching
shook
in
her
fingers
sister
here
ramy
come
to
look
at
the
clock
said
evelina
a
moment
later
in
the
high
drawl
she
cultivated
before
strangers
and
a
shortish
man
with
a
pale
bearded
face
and
upturned
came
stiffly
into
the
room
ann
eliza
let
her
work
fall
as
she
stood
up
you
very
welcome
sure
ramy
it
real
kind
of
you
to
nod
ad
all
a
tendency
to
illustrate
grimm
law
in
the
interchange
of
his
consonants
betrayed
the
clockmaker
nationality
but
he
was
evidently
used
to
speaking
english
or
at
least
the
particular
branch
of
the
vernacular
with
which
the
bunner
sisters
were
familiar
i
do
like
to
led
any
clock
go
out
of
my
store
without
being
sure
it
gives
satisfaction
he
added
oh
but
we
were
satisfied
ann
eliza
assured
him
but
i
was
you
see
said
ramy
looking
slowly
about
the
room
nor
i
wo
be
not
till
i
see
that
clock
going
all
may
i
assist
you
off
with
your
coat
ramy
evelina
interposed
she
could
never
trust
ann
eliza
to
remember
these
opening
ceremonies
thank
you
he
replied
and
taking
his
and
shabby
hat
she
laid
them
on
a
chair
with
the
gesture
she
imagined
the
lady
with
the
puffed
sleeves
might
make
use
of
on
similar
occasions
ann
eliza
social
sense
was
roused
and
she
felt
that
the
next
act
of
hospitality
must
be
hers
wo
you
suit
yourself
to
a
seat
she
suggested
my
sister
will
reach
down
the
clock
but
i
sure
she
all
right
again
she
went
beautiful
ever
since
you
fixed
dat
good
said
ramy
his
lips
parted
in
a
smile
which
showed
a
row
of
yellowish
teeth
with
one
or
two
gaps
in
it
but
in
spite
of
this
disclosure
ann
eliza
thought
his
smile
extremely
pleasant
there
was
something
wistful
and
conciliating
in
it
which
agreed
with
the
pathos
of
his
sunken
cheeks
and
prominent
eyes
as
he
took
the
lamp
the
light
fell
on
his
bulging
forehead
and
wide
skull
thinly
covered
with
grayish
hair
his
hands
were
pale
and
broad
with
knotty
joints
and
square
rimmed
with
grime
but
his
touch
was
as
light
as
a
woman
well
ladies
dat
clock
all
right
he
pronounced
i
sure
we
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
evelina
throwing
a
glance
at
her
sister
oh
ann
eliza
murmured
involuntarily
answering
the
admonition
she
selected
a
key
from
the
bunch
that
hung
at
her
waist
with
her
scissors
and
fitting
it
into
the
lock
of
the
cupboard
brought
out
the
cherry
brandy
and
three
glasses
engraved
with
it
a
very
cold
night
she
said
and
maybe
you
like
a
sip
of
this
cordial
it
was
made
a
great
while
ago
by
our
it
looks
fine
said
ramy
bowing
and
ann
eliza
filled
the
glasses
in
her
own
and
evelina
she
poured
only
a
few
drops
but
she
filled
their
guest
to
the
brim
my
sister
and
i
seldom
take
wine
she
explained
with
another
bow
which
included
both
his
hostesses
ramy
drank
off
the
cherry
brandy
and
pronounced
it
excellent
evelina
meanwhile
with
an
assumption
of
industry
intended
to
put
their
guest
at
ease
had
taken
up
her
instruments
and
was
twisting
a
into
shape
you
make
artificial
flowers
i
see
said
ramy
with
interest
it
very
pretty
work
i
had
a
in
shermany
dat
used
to
make
he
put
out
a
square
to
touch
the
petal
evelina
blushed
a
little
you
left
germany
long
ago
i
suppose
dear
me
yes
a
goot
while
ago
i
was
only
ninedeen
when
i
come
to
the
after
this
the
conversation
dragged
on
intermittently
till
ramy
peering
about
the
room
with
the
glance
of
his
race
said
with
an
air
of
interest
you
pleasantly
fixed
here
it
looks
real
the
note
of
wistfulness
in
his
voice
was
obscurely
moving
to
ann
eliza
oh
we
live
very
plainly
said
evelina
with
an
affectation
of
grandeur
deeply
impressive
to
her
sister
we
have
very
simple
you
look
real
comfortable
anyhow
said
ramy
his
bulging
eyes
seemed
to
muster
the
details
of
the
scene
with
a
gentle
envy
i
wisht
i
had
as
good
a
store
but
i
guess
no
blace
seems
when
always
alone
in
for
some
minutes
longer
the
conversation
moved
on
at
this
desultory
pace
and
then
ramy
who
had
been
obviously
nerving
himself
for
the
difficult
act
of
departure
took
his
leave
with
an
abruptness
which
would
have
startled
anyone
used
to
the
subtler
gradations
of
intercourse
but
to
ann
eliza
and
her
sister
there
was
nothing
surprising
in
his
abrupt
retreat
the
agonies
of
preparing
to
leave
and
the
subsequent
dumb
plunge
through
the
door
were
so
usual
in
their
circle
that
they
would
have
been
as
much
embarrassed
as
ramy
if
he
had
tried
to
put
any
fluency
into
his
adieux
after
he
had
left
both
sisters
remained
silent
for
a
while
then
evelina
laying
aside
her
unfinished
flower
said
i
go
and
lock
iv
intolerably
monotonous
seemed
now
to
the
bunner
sisters
the
treadmill
routine
of
the
shop
colourless
and
long
their
evenings
about
the
lamp
aimless
their
habitual
interchange
of
words
to
the
weary
accompaniment
of
the
sewing
and
pinking
machines
it
was
perhaps
with
the
idea
of
relieving
the
tension
of
their
mood
that
evelina
the
following
sunday
suggested
inviting
miss
mellins
to
supper
the
bunner
sisters
were
not
in
a
position
to
be
lavish
of
the
humblest
hospitality
but
two
or
three
times
in
the
year
they
shared
their
evening
meal
with
a
friend
and
miss
mellins
still
flushed
with
the
importance
of
her
turn
seemed
the
most
interesting
guest
they
could
invite
as
the
three
women
seated
themselves
at
the
embellished
by
the
unwonted
addition
of
pound
cake
and
sweet
pickles
the
sharp
swarthy
person
stood
out
vividly
between
the
sisters
miss
mellins
was
a
small
woman
with
a
glossy
yellow
face
and
a
frizz
of
black
hair
bristling
with
imitation
pins
her
sleeves
had
a
fashionable
cut
and
half
a
dozen
metal
bangles
rattled
on
her
wrists
her
voice
rattled
like
her
bangles
as
she
poured
forth
a
stream
of
anecdote
and
ejaculation
and
her
round
black
eyes
jumped
with
acrobatic
velocity
from
one
face
to
another
miss
mellins
was
always
having
or
hearing
of
amazing
adventures
she
had
surprised
a
burglar
in
her
room
at
midnight
though
how
he
got
there
what
he
robbed
her
of
and
by
what
means
he
escaped
had
never
been
quite
clear
to
her
auditors
she
had
been
warned
by
anonymous
letters
that
her
grocer
a
rejected
suitor
was
putting
poison
in
her
tea
she
had
a
customer
who
was
shadowed
by
detectives
and
another
a
very
wealthy
lady
who
had
been
arrested
in
a
department
store
for
kleptomania
she
had
been
present
at
a
spiritualist
seance
where
an
old
gentleman
had
died
in
a
fit
on
seeing
a
materialization
of
his
she
had
escaped
from
two
fires
in
her
and
at
the
funeral
of
her
first
cousin
the
horses
attached
to
the
hearse
had
run
away
and
smashed
the
coffin
precipitating
her
relative
into
an
open
before
the
eyes
of
his
distracted
family
a
sceptical
observer
might
have
explained
miss
mellins
proneness
to
adventure
by
the
fact
that
she
derived
her
chief
mental
nourishment
from
the
police
gazette
and
the
fireside
weekly
but
her
lot
was
cast
in
a
circle
where
such
insinuations
were
not
likely
to
be
heard
and
where
the
in
drama
had
long
been
her
recognized
right
yes
she
was
now
saying
her
emphatic
eyes
on
ann
eliza
you
may
not
believe
it
miss
bunner
and
i
do
know
i
should
myself
if
anybody
else
was
to
tell
me
but
over
a
year
before
ever
i
was
born
my
mother
she
went
to
see
a
gypsy
that
was
exhibited
in
a
tent
on
the
battery
with
the
lady
though
her
father
warned
her
not
to
and
what
you
she
told
her
why
she
told
her
these
very
words
says
she
next
child
be
a
girl
with
curls
and
she
suffer
from
spasms
mercy
murmured
ann
eliza
a
ripple
of
sympathy
running
down
her
spine
ever
have
spasms
before
miss
mellins
evelina
asked
yes
the
declared
and
where
you
suppose
i
had
why
at
my
cousin
emma
mcintyre
wedding
her
that
married
the
apothecary
over
in
jersey
city
though
her
mother
appeared
to
her
in
a
dream
and
told
her
she
rue
the
day
she
done
it
but
as
emma
said
she
got
more
advice
than
she
wanted
from
the
living
and
if
she
was
to
listen
to
spectres
too
she
never
be
sure
what
she
ought
to
do
and
what
she
ought
but
i
will
say
her
husband
took
to
drink
and
she
never
was
the
same
woman
after
her
fust
baby
well
they
had
an
elegant
church
wedding
and
what
you
i
saw
as
i
was
walkin
up
the
aisle
with
the
wedding
percession
well
ann
eliza
whispered
forgetting
to
thread
her
needle
why
a
coffin
to
be
sure
right
on
the
top
step
of
the
chancel
folks
is
and
she
would
have
a
church
wedding
though
his
mother
raised
a
terrible
rumpus
over
it
well
there
it
set
right
in
front
of
where
the
minister
stood
that
was
going
to
marry
a
coffin
covered
with
a
black
velvet
pall
with
a
gold
fringe
and
a
in
white
camellias
atop
of
goodness
said
evelina
starting
there
a
knock
who
can
it
be
shuddered
ann
eliza
still
under
the
spell
of
miss
mellins
hallucination
evelina
rose
and
lit
a
candle
to
guide
her
through
the
shop
they
heard
her
turn
the
key
of
the
outer
door
and
a
gust
of
night
air
stirred
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
back
room
then
there
was
a
sound
of
vivacious
exclamations
and
evelina
returned
with
ramy
ann
eliza
heart
rocked
like
a
boat
in
a
heavy
sea
and
the
eyes
distended
with
curiosity
sprang
eagerly
from
face
to
face
i
just
thought
i
call
in
again
said
ramy
evidently
somewhat
disconcerted
by
the
presence
of
miss
mellins
just
to
see
how
the
clock
behaving
he
added
with
his
smile
oh
she
behaving
beautiful
said
ann
eliza
but
we
real
glad
to
see
you
all
the
same
miss
mellins
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
the
tossed
back
her
head
and
dropped
her
lids
in
condescending
recognition
of
the
stranger
presence
and
ramy
responded
by
an
awkward
bow
after
the
first
moment
of
constraint
a
renewed
sense
of
satisfaction
filled
the
consciousness
of
the
three
women
the
bunner
sisters
were
not
sorry
to
let
miss
mellins
see
that
they
received
an
occasional
evening
visit
and
miss
mellins
was
clearly
enchanted
at
the
opportunity
of
pouring
her
latest
tale
into
a
new
ear
as
for
ramy
he
adjusted
himself
to
the
situation
with
greater
ease
than
might
have
been
expected
and
evelina
who
had
been
sorry
that
he
should
enter
the
room
while
the
remains
of
supper
still
lingered
on
the
table
blushed
with
pleasure
at
his
offer
to
help
her
glear
the
table
cleared
ann
eliza
suggested
a
game
of
cards
and
it
was
after
eleven
when
ramy
rose
to
take
leave
his
adieux
were
so
much
less
abrupt
than
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
that
evelina
was
able
to
satisfy
her
sense
of
etiquette
by
escorting
him
candle
in
hand
to
the
outer
door
and
as
the
two
disappeared
into
the
shop
miss
mellins
playfully
turned
to
ann
eliza
well
well
miss
bunner
she
murmured
jerking
her
chin
in
the
direction
of
the
retreating
figures
i
no
idea
your
sister
was
keeping
company
to
think
ann
eliza
roused
from
a
state
of
dreamy
beatitude
turned
her
timid
eyes
on
the
oh
you
mistaken
miss
mellins
we
do
know
miss
mellins
smiled
incredulously
you
go
miss
bunner
i
guess
there
be
a
wedding
somewheres
round
here
before
spring
and
i
be
real
offended
if
i
ai
asked
to
make
the
dress
i
always
seen
her
in
a
gored
satin
with
ann
eliza
made
no
answer
she
had
grown
very
pale
and
her
eyes
lingered
searchingly
on
evelina
as
the
younger
sister
the
room
evelina
cheeks
were
pink
and
her
blue
eyes
glittered
but
it
seemed
to
ann
eliza
that
the
coquettish
tilt
of
her
head
regrettably
emphasized
the
weakness
of
her
receding
chin
it
was
the
first
time
that
ann
eliza
had
ever
seen
a
flaw
in
her
sister
beauty
and
her
involuntary
criticism
startled
her
like
a
secret
disloyalty
that
night
after
the
light
had
been
put
out
the
elder
sister
knelt
longer
than
usual
at
her
prayers
in
the
silence
of
the
darkened
room
she
was
offering
up
certain
dreams
and
aspirations
whose
brief
blossoming
had
lent
a
transient
freshness
to
her
days
she
wondered
now
how
she
could
ever
have
supposed
that
ramy
visits
had
another
cause
than
the
one
miss
mellins
suggested
had
not
the
sight
of
evelina
first
inspired
him
with
a
sudden
solicitude
for
the
welfare
of
the
clock
and
what
charms
but
evelina
could
have
induced
him
to
repeat
his
visit
grief
held
up
its
torch
to
the
frail
fabric
of
ann
illusions
and
with
a
firm
heart
she
watched
them
shrivel
into
ashes
then
rising
from
her
knees
full
of
the
chill
joy
of
renunciation
she
laid
a
kiss
on
the
crimping
pins
of
the
sleeping
evelina
and
crept
under
the
bedspread
at
her
side
v
during
the
months
that
followed
ramy
visited
the
sisters
with
increasing
frequency
it
became
his
habit
to
call
on
them
every
sunday
evening
and
occasionally
during
the
week
he
would
find
an
excuse
for
dropping
in
unannounced
as
they
were
settling
down
to
their
work
beside
the
lamp
ann
eliza
noticed
that
evelina
now
took
the
precaution
of
putting
on
her
crimson
bow
every
evening
before
supper
and
that
she
had
refurbished
with
a
bit
of
carefully
washed
lace
the
black
silk
which
they
still
called
new
because
it
had
been
bought
a
year
after
ann
eliza
ramy
as
he
grew
more
intimate
became
less
conversational
and
after
the
sisters
had
blushingly
accorded
him
the
privilege
of
a
pipe
he
began
to
permit
himself
long
stretches
of
meditative
silence
that
were
not
without
charm
to
his
hostesses
there
was
something
at
once
fortifying
and
pacific
in
the
sense
of
that
tranquil
male
presence
in
an
atmosphere
which
had
so
long
quivered
with
little
feminine
doubts
and
distresses
and
the
sisters
fell
into
the
habit
of
saying
to
each
other
in
moments
of
uncertainty
we
ask
ramy
when
he
comes
and
of
accepting
his
verdict
whatever
it
might
be
with
a
fatalistic
readiness
that
relieved
them
of
all
responsibility
when
ramy
drew
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
became
in
his
turn
confidential
the
acuteness
of
their
sympathy
grew
almost
painful
to
the
sisters
with
passionate
participation
they
listened
to
the
story
of
his
early
struggles
in
germany
and
of
the
long
illness
which
had
been
the
cause
of
his
recent
misfortunes
the
name
of
the
hochmuller
an
old
comrade
widow
who
had
nursed
him
through
his
fever
was
greeted
with
reverential
sighs
and
an
inward
pang
of
envy
whenever
it
recurred
in
his
biographical
monologues
and
once
when
the
sisters
were
alone
evelina
called
a
responsive
flush
to
ann
eliza
brow
by
saying
suddenly
without
the
mention
of
any
name
i
wonder
what
she
like
one
day
toward
spring
ramy
who
had
by
this
time
become
as
much
a
part
of
their
lives
as
the
or
the
milkman
ventured
the
suggestion
that
the
ladies
should
accompany
him
to
an
exhibition
of
stereopticon
views
which
was
to
take
place
at
chickering
hall
on
the
following
evening
after
their
first
breathless
oh
of
pleasure
there
was
a
silence
of
mutual
consultation
which
ann
eliza
at
last
broke
by
saying
you
better
go
with
ramy
evelina
i
guess
we
do
both
want
to
leave
the
store
at
evelina
with
such
protests
as
politeness
demanded
acquiesced
in
this
opinion
and
spent
the
next
day
in
trimming
a
white
chip
bonnet
with
of
her
own
making
ann
eliza
brought
out
her
mosaic
brooch
a
cashmere
scarf
of
their
mother
was
taken
from
its
linen
cerements
and
thus
adorned
evelina
blushingly
departed
with
ramy
while
the
elder
sister
sat
down
in
her
place
at
the
it
seemed
to
ann
eliza
that
she
was
alone
for
hours
and
she
was
surprised
when
she
heard
evelina
tap
on
the
door
to
find
that
the
clock
marked
only
ten
it
must
have
gone
wrong
again
she
reflected
as
she
rose
to
let
her
sister
in
the
evening
had
been
brilliantly
interesting
and
several
striking
stereopticon
views
of
berlin
had
afforded
ramy
the
opportunity
of
enlarging
on
the
marvels
of
his
native
city
he
said
he
love
to
show
it
all
to
me
evelina
declared
as
ann
eliza
conned
her
glowing
face
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
silly
i
know
which
way
to
ann
eliza
received
this
confidence
with
a
sympathetic
murmur
my
bonnet
is
becoming
is
it
evelina
went
on
irrelevantly
smiling
at
her
reflection
in
the
cracked
glass
above
the
chest
of
drawers
you
jest
lovely
said
ann
eliza
spring
was
making
itself
unmistakably
known
to
the
distrustful
new
yorker
by
an
increased
harshness
of
wind
and
prevalence
of
dust
when
one
day
evelina
entered
the
back
room
at
with
a
cluster
of
jonquils
in
her
hand
i
was
just
that
foolish
she
answered
ann
eliza
wondering
glance
i
could
help
buyin
i
felt
as
if
i
must
have
something
pretty
to
look
at
right
oh
sister
said
ann
eliza
in
trembling
sympathy
she
felt
that
special
indulgence
must
be
conceded
to
those
in
evelina
state
since
she
had
had
her
own
fleeting
vision
of
such
mysterious
longings
as
the
words
betrayed
evelina
meanwhile
had
taken
the
bundle
of
dried
grasses
out
of
the
broken
china
vase
and
was
putting
the
jonquils
in
their
place
with
touches
that
lingered
down
their
smooth
stems
and
leaves
ai
they
pretty
she
kept
repeating
as
she
gathered
the
flowers
into
a
starry
circle
seems
as
if
spring
was
really
here
do
it
ann
eliza
remembered
that
it
was
ramy
evening
when
he
came
the
teutonic
eye
for
anything
that
blooms
made
him
turn
at
once
to
the
jonquils
ai
dey
pretty
he
said
seems
like
as
if
de
spring
was
really
do
it
evelina
exclaimed
thrilled
by
the
coincidence
of
their
thought
it
just
what
i
was
saying
to
my
ann
eliza
got
up
suddenly
and
moved
away
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
wound
the
clock
the
day
before
evelina
was
sitting
at
the
table
the
jonquils
rose
slenderly
between
herself
and
ramy
oh
she
murmured
with
vague
eyes
how
i
love
to
get
away
somewheres
into
the
country
this
very
minute
somewheres
where
it
was
green
and
quiet
seems
as
if
i
could
stand
the
city
another
but
ann
eliza
noticed
that
she
was
looking
at
ramy
and
not
at
the
flowers
i
guess
we
might
go
to
cendral
park
some
sunday
their
visitor
suggested
do
you
ever
go
there
miss
evelina
no
we
do
very
often
leastways
we
ai
been
for
a
good
she
sparkled
at
the
prospect
it
would
be
lovely
would
it
ann
eliza
why
yes
said
the
elder
sister
coming
back
to
her
seat
well
why
do
we
go
next
sunday
ramy
continued
and
invite
miss
mellins
too
that
make
a
gosy
little
that
night
when
evelina
undressed
she
took
a
jonquil
from
the
vase
and
pressed
it
with
a
certain
ostentation
between
the
leaves
of
her
ann
eliza
covertly
observing
her
felt
that
evelina
was
not
sorry
to
be
observed
and
that
her
own
acute
consciousness
of
the
act
was
somehow
regarded
as
magnifying
its
significance
the
following
sunday
broke
blue
and
warm
the
bunner
sisters
were
habitual
but
for
once
they
left
their
on
the
and
ten
found
them
gloved
and
bonneted
awaiting
miss
mellins
knock
miss
mellins
presently
appeared
in
a
glitter
of
jet
sequins
and
spangles
with
a
tale
of
having
seen
a
strange
man
prowling
under
her
windows
till
he
was
called
off
at
dawn
by
a
whistle
and
shortly
afterward
came
ramy
his
hair
brushed
with
more
than
usual
care
his
broad
hands
encased
in
gloves
of
kid
the
little
party
set
out
for
the
nearest
and
a
flutter
of
mingled
gratification
and
embarrassment
stirred
ann
eliza
bosom
when
it
was
found
that
ramy
intended
to
pay
their
fares
nor
did
he
fail
to
live
up
to
this
opening
liberality
for
after
guiding
them
through
the
mall
and
the
ramble
he
led
the
way
to
a
rustic
restaurant
where
also
at
his
expense
they
fared
idyllically
on
milk
and
after
this
they
resumed
their
walk
strolling
on
with
the
slowness
of
unaccustomed
from
one
path
to
another
through
budding
shrubberies
past
sprinkled
with
lilac
crocuses
and
under
rocks
on
which
the
forsythia
lay
like
sudden
sunshine
everything
about
her
seemed
new
and
miraculously
lovely
to
ann
eliza
but
she
kept
her
feelings
to
herself
leaving
it
to
evelina
to
exclaim
at
the
hepaticas
under
the
shady
ledges
and
to
miss
mellins
less
interested
in
the
vegetable
than
in
the
human
world
to
remark
significantly
on
the
probable
history
of
the
persons
they
met
all
the
alleys
were
thronged
with
promenaders
and
obstructed
by
perambulators
and
miss
running
commentary
threw
a
glare
of
lurid
possibilities
over
the
placid
family
groups
and
their
romping
progeny
ann
eliza
was
in
no
mood
for
such
interpretations
of
life
but
knowing
that
miss
mellins
had
been
invited
for
the
sole
purpose
of
keeping
her
company
she
continued
to
cling
to
the
side
letting
ramy
lead
the
way
with
evelina
miss
mellins
stimulated
by
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
grew
more
and
more
discursive
and
her
ceaseless
talk
and
the
kaleidoscopic
whirl
of
the
crowd
were
unspeakably
bewildering
to
ann
eliza
her
feet
accustomed
to
the
slippered
ease
of
the
shop
ached
with
the
unfamiliar
effort
of
walking
and
her
ears
with
the
din
of
the
anecdotes
but
every
nerve
in
her
was
aware
of
evelina
enjoyment
and
she
was
determined
that
no
weariness
of
hers
should
curtail
it
yet
even
her
heroism
shrank
from
the
significant
glances
which
miss
mellins
presently
began
to
cast
at
the
couple
in
front
of
them
ann
eliza
could
bear
to
connive
at
evelina
bliss
but
not
to
acknowledge
it
to
others
at
length
evelina
feet
also
failed
her
and
she
turned
to
suggest
that
they
ought
to
be
going
home
her
flushed
face
had
grown
pale
with
fatigue
but
her
eyes
were
radiant
the
return
lived
in
ann
eliza
memory
with
the
persistence
of
an
evil
dream
the
were
packed
with
the
returning
throng
and
they
had
to
let
a
dozen
go
by
before
they
could
push
their
way
into
one
that
was
already
crowded
ann
eliza
had
never
before
felt
so
tired
even
miss
mellins
flow
of
narrative
ran
dry
and
they
sat
silent
wedged
between
a
negro
woman
and
a
man
with
a
bandaged
head
while
the
car
rumbled
slowly
down
a
squalid
avenue
to
their
corner
evelina
and
ramy
sat
together
in
the
forward
part
of
the
car
and
ann
eliza
could
catch
only
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
bonnet
and
the
shiny
but
when
the
little
party
got
out
at
their
corner
the
crowd
swept
them
together
again
and
they
walked
back
in
the
effortless
silence
of
tired
children
to
the
bunner
basement
as
miss
mellins
and
ramy
turned
to
go
their
various
ways
evelina
mustered
a
last
display
of
smiles
but
ann
eliza
crossed
the
threshold
in
silence
feeling
the
stillness
of
the
little
shop
reach
out
to
her
like
consoling
arms
that
night
she
could
not
sleep
but
as
she
lay
cold
and
rigid
at
her
sister
side
she
suddenly
felt
the
pressure
of
evelina
arms
and
heard
her
whisper
oh
ann
eliza
war
it
heavenly
vi
for
four
days
after
their
sunday
in
the
park
the
bunner
sisters
had
no
news
of
ramy
at
first
neither
one
betrayed
her
disappointment
and
anxiety
to
the
other
but
on
the
fifth
morning
evelina
always
the
first
to
yield
to
her
feelings
said
as
she
turned
from
her
untasted
tea
i
thought
you
oughter
take
that
money
out
by
now
ann
ann
eliza
understood
and
reddened
the
winter
had
been
a
fairly
prosperous
one
for
the
sisters
and
their
slowly
accumulated
savings
had
now
reached
the
handsome
sum
of
two
hundred
dollars
but
the
satisfaction
they
might
have
felt
in
this
unwonted
opulence
had
been
clouded
by
a
suggestion
of
miss
mellins
that
there
were
dark
rumours
concerning
the
savings
bank
in
which
their
funds
were
deposited
they
knew
miss
mellins
was
given
to
vain
alarms
but
her
words
by
the
sheer
force
of
repetition
had
so
shaken
ann
eliza
peace
that
after
long
hours
of
midnight
counsel
the
sisters
had
decided
to
advise
with
ramy
and
on
ann
eliza
as
the
head
of
the
house
this
duty
had
devolved
ramy
when
consulted
had
not
only
confirmed
the
report
but
had
offered
to
find
some
safe
investment
which
should
give
the
sisters
a
higher
rate
of
interest
than
the
suspected
savings
bank
and
ann
eliza
knew
that
evelina
alluded
to
the
suggested
transfer
why
yes
to
be
sure
she
agreed
mr
ramy
said
if
he
was
us
he
would
want
to
leave
his
money
there
any
he
could
it
was
over
a
week
ago
he
said
it
evelina
reminded
her
i
know
but
he
told
me
to
wait
till
he
found
out
for
sure
about
that
other
investment
and
we
ai
seen
him
since
ann
eliza
words
released
their
secret
fear
i
wonder
what
happened
to
him
evelina
said
you
do
suppose
he
could
be
sick
i
was
wondering
too
ann
eliza
rejoined
and
the
sisters
looked
down
at
their
plates
i
should
think
you
oughter
do
something
about
that
money
pretty
soon
evelina
began
again
well
i
know
i
oughter
what
would
you
do
if
you
was
me
if
i
was
you
said
her
sister
with
perceptible
emphasis
and
a
rising
blush
i
go
right
round
and
see
if
ramy
was
sick
you
the
words
pierced
ann
eliza
like
a
blade
yes
that
so
she
said
it
would
only
seem
friendly
if
he
really
is
sick
if
i
was
you
i
go
evelina
continued
and
after
dinner
ann
eliza
went
on
the
way
she
had
to
leave
a
parcel
at
the
dyer
and
having
performed
that
errand
she
turned
toward
ramy
shop
never
before
had
she
felt
so
old
so
hopeless
and
humble
she
knew
she
was
bound
on
a
of
evelina
and
the
knowledge
seemed
to
dry
the
last
drop
of
young
blood
in
her
veins
it
took
from
her
too
all
her
faded
virginal
shyness
and
with
a
brisk
composure
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
but
as
she
entered
her
heart
began
to
tremble
for
she
saw
ramy
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
sitting
behind
the
counter
in
an
attitude
of
strange
dejection
at
the
click
of
the
latch
he
looked
up
slowly
fixing
a
lustreless
stare
on
ann
eliza
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
did
not
know
her
oh
you
sick
she
exclaimed
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
seemed
to
recall
his
wandering
senses
why
if
it
ai
miss
bunner
he
said
in
a
low
thick
tone
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
move
and
she
noticed
that
his
face
was
the
colour
of
yellow
ashes
you
are
sick
she
persisted
emboldened
by
his
evident
need
of
help
mr
ramy
it
was
real
unfriendly
of
you
not
to
let
us
he
continued
to
look
at
her
with
dull
eyes
i
ai
been
sick
he
said
leastways
not
very
only
one
of
my
old
he
spoke
in
a
slow
laboured
way
as
if
he
had
difficulty
in
getting
his
words
together
rheumatism
she
ventured
seeing
how
unwillingly
he
seemed
to
move
well
somethin
like
maybe
i
could
hardly
put
a
name
to
if
it
was
anything
like
rheumatism
my
grandmother
used
to
make
a
tea
ann
eliza
began
she
had
forgotten
in
the
warmth
of
the
moment
that
she
had
only
come
as
evelina
messenger
at
the
mention
of
tea
an
expression
of
uncontrollable
repugnance
passed
over
ramy
face
oh
i
guess
i
getting
on
all
right
i
just
got
a
headache
ann
eliza
courage
dropped
at
the
note
of
refusal
in
his
voice
i
sorry
she
said
gently
my
sister
and
me
have
been
glad
to
do
anything
we
could
for
thank
you
kindly
said
ramy
wearily
then
as
she
turned
to
the
door
he
added
with
an
effort
maybe
i
step
round
we
be
real
glad
ann
eliza
repeated
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
dusty
bronze
clock
in
the
window
she
was
unaware
of
looking
at
it
at
the
time
but
long
afterward
she
remembered
that
it
represented
a
newfoundland
dog
with
his
paw
on
an
open
book
when
she
reached
home
there
was
a
purchaser
in
the
shop
turning
over
hooks
and
eyes
under
evelina
supervision
ann
eliza
passed
hastily
into
the
back
room
but
in
an
instant
she
heard
her
sister
at
her
side
quick
i
told
her
i
was
goin
to
look
for
some
smaller
hooks
how
is
he
evelina
gasped
he
ai
been
very
well
said
ann
eliza
slowly
her
eyes
on
eager
face
but
he
says
he
be
sure
to
be
round
he
will
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
why
evelina
bunner
oh
i
do
care
cried
the
younger
recklessly
rushing
back
into
the
shop
ann
eliza
stood
burning
with
the
shame
of
evelina
she
was
shocked
that
even
to
her
evelina
should
lay
bare
the
nakedness
of
her
emotion
and
she
tried
to
turn
her
thoughts
from
it
as
though
its
recollection
made
her
a
sharer
in
her
sister
debasement
the
next
evening
ramy
reappeared
still
somewhat
sallow
and
but
otherwise
his
usual
self
ann
eliza
consulted
him
about
the
investment
he
had
recommended
and
after
it
had
been
settled
that
he
should
attend
to
the
matter
for
her
he
took
up
the
illustrated
volume
of
longfellow
for
as
the
sisters
had
learned
his
culture
soared
beyond
the
newspapers
and
read
aloud
with
a
fine
confusion
of
consonants
the
poem
on
evelina
lowered
her
lids
while
he
read
it
was
a
very
beautiful
evening
and
ann
eliza
thought
afterward
how
different
life
might
have
been
with
a
companion
who
read
poetry
like
ramy
vii
during
the
ensuing
weeks
ramy
though
his
visits
were
as
frequent
as
ever
did
not
seem
to
regain
his
usual
spirits
he
complained
frequently
of
headache
but
rejected
ann
eliza
tentatively
proffered
remedies
and
seemed
to
shrink
from
any
prolonged
investigation
of
his
symptoms
july
had
come
with
a
sudden
ardour
of
heat
and
one
evening
as
the
three
sat
together
by
the
open
window
in
the
back
room
evelina
said
i
dunno
what
i
would
give
a
night
like
this
for
a
breath
of
real
country
so
would
i
said
ramy
knocking
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
i
like
to
be
setting
in
an
arbour
dis
very
oh
would
it
be
lovely
i
always
think
it
real
cool
here
we
be
heaps
hotter
up
where
miss
mellins
is
said
ann
eliza
oh
i
daresay
but
we
be
heaps
cooler
somewhere
else
her
sister
snapped
she
was
not
infrequently
exasperated
by
ann
eliza
furtive
attempts
to
mollify
providence
a
few
days
later
ramy
appeared
with
a
suggestion
which
enchanted
evelina
he
had
gone
the
day
before
to
see
his
friend
hochmuller
who
lived
in
the
outskirts
of
hoboken
and
hochmuller
had
proposed
that
on
the
following
sunday
he
should
bring
the
bunner
sisters
to
spend
the
day
with
her
she
got
a
real
garden
you
know
ramy
explained
wid
trees
and
a
real
to
set
in
and
hens
and
chickens
too
and
it
an
elegant
sail
over
on
de
the
proposal
drew
no
response
from
ann
eliza
she
was
still
oppressed
by
the
recollection
of
her
interminable
sunday
in
the
park
but
obedient
to
evelina
imperious
glance
she
finally
faltered
out
an
acceptance
the
sunday
was
a
very
hot
one
and
once
on
the
ann
eliza
revived
at
the
touch
of
the
salt
breeze
and
the
spectacle
of
the
crowded
waters
but
when
they
reached
the
other
shore
and
stepped
out
on
the
dirty
wharf
she
began
to
ache
with
anticipated
weariness
they
got
into
a
and
were
jolted
from
one
mean
street
to
another
till
at
length
ramy
pulled
the
conductor
sleeve
and
they
got
out
again
then
they
stood
in
the
blazing
sun
near
the
door
of
a
crowded
waiting
for
another
car
to
come
and
that
carried
them
out
to
a
thinly
settled
district
past
vacant
lots
and
narrow
brick
houses
standing
in
unsupported
solitude
till
they
finally
reached
an
almost
rural
region
of
scattered
cottages
and
low
wooden
buildings
that
looked
like
village
here
the
car
finally
stopped
of
its
own
accord
and
they
walked
along
a
rutty
road
past
a
yard
with
a
high
fence
tapestried
with
theatrical
advertisements
to
a
little
red
house
with
green
blinds
and
a
garden
paling
really
ramy
had
not
deceived
them
clumps
of
dielytra
and
bloomed
behind
the
paling
and
a
crooked
elm
hung
romantically
over
the
gable
of
the
house
at
the
gate
hochmuller
a
broad
woman
in
merino
met
them
with
nods
and
smiles
while
her
daughter
linda
a
girl
with
mottled
red
cheeks
and
a
sidelong
stare
hovered
inquisitively
behind
her
hochmuller
leading
the
way
into
the
house
conducted
the
bunner
sisters
the
way
to
her
bedroom
here
they
were
invited
to
spread
out
on
a
mountainous
white
featherbed
the
cashmere
mantles
under
which
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
had
compelled
them
to
swelter
and
when
they
had
given
their
black
silks
the
necessary
twitch
of
readjustment
and
evelina
had
fluffed
out
her
hair
before
a
framed
in
work
their
hostess
led
them
to
a
stuffy
parlour
smelling
of
gingerbread
after
another
ceremonial
pause
broken
by
polite
enquiries
and
shy
ejaculations
they
were
shown
into
the
kitchen
where
the
table
was
already
spread
with
and
stewed
fruits
and
where
they
presently
found
themselves
seated
between
hochmuller
and
ramy
while
the
staring
linda
bumped
back
and
forth
from
the
stove
with
steaming
dishes
to
ann
eliza
the
dinner
seemed
endless
and
the
rich
fare
strangely
unappetizing
she
was
abashed
by
the
easy
intimacy
of
her
voice
and
eye
with
ramy
hochmuller
was
almost
flippantly
familiar
and
it
was
only
when
ann
eliza
pictured
her
generous
form
bent
above
his
that
she
could
forgive
her
for
tersely
addressing
him
as
during
one
of
the
pauses
of
the
meal
hochmuller
laid
her
knife
and
fork
against
the
edges
of
her
plate
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
face
said
accusingly
you
hat
one
of
dem
turns
again
i
dunno
as
i
had
he
returned
evasively
evelina
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
mr
ramy
has
been
sick
she
said
at
length
as
though
to
show
that
she
also
was
in
a
position
to
speak
with
authority
he
complained
very
frequently
of
ho
i
know
him
said
hochmuller
with
a
laugh
her
eyes
still
on
the
ai
you
ashamed
of
yourself
ramy
ramy
who
was
looking
at
his
plate
said
suddenly
one
word
which
the
sisters
could
not
understand
it
sounded
to
ann
eliza
like
hochmuller
laughed
again
my
my
she
said
would
you
think
he
be
ashamed
to
go
and
be
sick
and
never
dell
me
me
that
nursed
him
troo
dat
awful
fever
yes
i
should
said
evelina
with
a
spirited
glance
at
ramy
but
he
was
looking
at
the
sausages
that
linda
had
just
put
on
the
table
when
dinner
was
over
hochmuller
invited
her
guests
to
step
out
of
the
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
green
enclosure
half
garden
half
orchard
grey
hens
followed
by
golden
broods
clucked
under
the
twisted
a
cat
dozed
on
the
edge
of
an
old
well
and
from
tree
to
tree
ran
the
network
of
that
denoted
hochmuller
calling
beyond
the
apple
trees
stood
a
yellow
festooned
with
scarlet
runners
and
below
it
on
the
farther
side
of
a
rough
fence
the
land
dipped
down
holding
a
bit
of
woodland
in
its
hollow
it
was
all
strangely
sweet
and
still
on
that
hot
sunday
afternoon
and
as
she
moved
across
the
grass
under
the
ann
eliza
thought
of
quiet
afternoons
in
church
and
of
the
hymns
her
mother
had
sung
to
her
when
she
was
a
baby
evelina
was
more
restless
she
wandered
from
the
well
to
the
and
back
she
tossed
crumbs
to
the
chickens
and
disturbed
the
cat
with
arch
caresses
and
at
last
she
expressed
a
desire
to
go
down
into
the
wood
i
guess
you
got
to
go
round
by
the
road
then
said
hochmuller
my
linda
she
goes
troo
a
hole
in
de
fence
but
i
guess
you
tear
your
dress
if
you
was
to
i
help
you
said
ramy
and
guided
by
linda
the
pair
walked
along
the
fence
till
they
reached
a
narrow
gap
in
its
boards
through
this
they
disappeared
watched
curiously
in
their
descent
by
the
grinning
linda
while
hochmuller
and
ann
eliza
were
left
alone
in
the
hochmuller
looked
at
her
guest
with
a
confidential
smile
i
guess
dey
be
gone
quite
a
while
she
remarked
jerking
her
double
chin
toward
the
gap
in
the
fence
folks
like
dat
do
never
remember
about
de
and
she
drew
out
her
knitting
ann
eliza
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
your
sister
she
thinks
a
great
lot
of
him
do
she
her
hostess
continued
ann
eliza
cheeks
grew
hot
ai
you
a
teeny
bit
lonesome
away
out
here
sometimes
she
asked
i
should
think
you
be
scared
nights
all
alone
with
your
oh
no
i
ai
said
hochmuller
you
see
i
take
in
washing
dat
my
business
and
it
a
lot
cheaper
doing
it
out
here
dan
in
de
city
where
i
get
a
like
dis
in
hobucken
and
den
it
safer
for
linda
too
it
geeps
her
outer
de
oh
said
ann
eliza
shrinking
she
began
to
feel
a
distinct
aversion
for
her
hostess
and
her
eyes
turned
with
involuntary
annoyance
to
the
form
of
linda
still
inquisitively
suspended
on
the
fence
it
seemed
to
ann
eliza
that
evelina
and
her
companion
would
never
return
from
the
wood
but
they
came
at
length
ramy
brow
pearled
with
perspiration
evelina
pink
and
conscious
a
drooping
bunch
of
ferns
in
her
hand
and
it
was
clear
that
to
her
at
least
the
moments
had
been
winged
suppose
they
revive
she
asked
holding
up
the
ferns
but
ann
eliza
rising
at
her
approach
said
stiffly
we
better
be
getting
home
mercy
me
ai
you
going
to
take
your
coffee
first
hochmuller
protested
and
ann
eliza
found
to
her
dismay
that
another
long
gastronomic
ceremony
must
intervene
before
politeness
permitted
them
to
leave
at
length
however
they
found
themselves
again
on
the
water
and
sky
were
grey
with
a
dividing
gleam
of
sunset
that
sent
sleek
opal
waves
in
the
boat
wake
the
wind
had
a
cool
tarry
breath
as
though
it
had
travelled
over
miles
of
shipping
and
the
hiss
of
the
water
about
the
paddles
was
as
delicious
as
though
it
had
been
splashed
into
their
tired
faces
ann
eliza
sat
apart
looking
away
from
the
others
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
ramy
had
proposed
to
evelina
in
the
wood
and
she
was
silently
preparing
herself
to
receive
her
sister
confidence
that
evening
but
evelina
was
apparently
in
no
mood
for
confidences
when
they
reached
home
she
put
her
faded
ferns
in
water
and
after
supper
when
she
had
laid
aside
her
silk
dress
and
the
bonnet
she
remained
silently
seated
in
her
near
the
open
window
it
was
long
since
ann
eliza
had
seen
her
in
so
uncommunicative
a
mood
the
following
saturday
ann
eliza
was
sitting
alone
in
the
shop
when
the
door
opened
and
ramy
entered
he
had
never
before
called
at
that
hour
and
she
wondered
a
little
anxiously
what
had
brought
him
has
anything
happened
she
asked
pushing
aside
the
basketful
of
buttons
she
had
been
sorting
not
i
know
of
said
ramy
tranquilly
but
i
always
close
up
the
store
at
two
saturdays
at
this
season
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
call
round
and
see
i
real
glad
i
sure
said
ann
eliza
but
evelina
i
know
dat
ramy
answered
i
met
her
round
de
corner
she
told
me
she
got
to
go
to
dat
new
dyer
up
in
street
she
wo
be
back
for
a
couple
of
hours
will
she
ann
eliza
looked
at
him
with
rising
bewilderment
no
i
guess
not
she
answered
her
instinctive
hospitality
prompting
her
to
add
wo
you
set
down
jest
the
same
ramy
sat
down
on
the
stool
beside
the
counter
and
ann
eliza
returned
to
her
place
behind
it
i
ca
leave
the
store
she
explained
well
i
guess
we
very
well
ann
eliza
had
become
suddenly
aware
that
ramy
was
looking
at
her
with
unusual
intentness
involuntarily
her
hand
strayed
to
the
thin
streaks
of
hair
on
her
temples
and
thence
descended
to
straighten
the
brooch
beneath
her
collar
you
looking
very
well
miss
bunner
said
ramy
following
her
gesture
with
a
smile
oh
said
ann
eliza
nervously
i
always
well
in
health
she
added
i
guess
you
healthier
than
your
sister
even
if
you
are
less
oh
i
do
know
evelina
a
mite
nervous
sometimes
but
she
ai
a
bit
she
eats
heartier
than
you
do
but
that
do
mean
nothing
said
ramy
ann
eliza
was
silent
she
could
not
follow
the
trend
of
his
thought
and
she
did
not
care
to
commit
herself
farther
about
evelina
before
she
had
ascertained
if
ramy
considered
nervousness
interesting
or
the
reverse
but
ramy
spared
her
all
farther
indecision
well
miss
bunner
he
said
drawing
his
stool
closer
to
the
counter
i
guess
i
might
as
well
tell
you
fust
as
last
what
i
come
here
for
i
want
to
get
ann
eliza
in
many
a
prayerful
midnight
hour
had
sought
to
strengthen
herself
for
the
hearing
of
this
avowal
but
now
that
it
had
come
she
felt
pitifully
frightened
and
unprepared
ramy
was
leaning
with
both
elbows
on
the
counter
and
she
noticed
that
his
nails
were
clean
and
that
he
had
brushed
his
hat
yet
even
these
signs
had
not
prepared
her
at
last
she
heard
herself
say
with
a
dry
throat
in
which
her
heart
was
hammering
mercy
me
ramy
i
want
to
get
married
he
repeated
i
too
lonesome
it
ai
good
for
a
man
to
live
all
alone
and
eat
noding
but
cold
meat
every
no
said
ann
eliza
softly
and
the
dust
fairly
beats
oh
the
dust
i
know
ramy
stretched
one
of
his
hands
toward
her
i
wisht
you
take
still
ann
eliza
did
not
understand
she
rose
hesitatingly
from
her
seat
pushing
aside
the
basket
of
buttons
which
lay
between
them
then
she
perceived
that
ramy
was
trying
to
take
her
hand
and
as
their
fingers
met
a
flood
of
joy
swept
over
her
never
afterward
though
every
other
word
of
their
interview
was
stamped
on
her
memory
beyond
all
possible
forgetting
could
she
recall
what
he
said
while
their
hands
touched
she
only
knew
that
she
seemed
to
be
floating
on
a
summer
sea
and
that
all
its
waves
were
in
her
ears
me
me
she
gasped
i
guess
so
said
her
suitor
placidly
you
suit
me
right
down
to
the
ground
miss
bunner
dat
the
a
woman
passing
along
the
street
paused
to
look
at
the
and
ann
eliza
half
hoped
she
would
come
in
but
after
a
desultory
inspection
she
went
on
maybe
you
do
fancy
me
ramy
suggested
discountenanced
by
ann
eliza
silence
a
word
of
assent
was
on
her
tongue
but
her
lips
refused
it
she
must
find
some
other
way
of
telling
him
i
do
say
well
i
always
kinder
thought
we
was
suited
to
one
another
ramy
continued
eased
of
his
momentary
doubt
i
always
liked
de
quiet
style
no
fuss
and
airs
and
not
afraid
of
he
spoke
as
though
dispassionately
cataloguing
her
charms
ann
eliza
felt
that
she
must
make
an
end
but
ramy
you
understand
i
never
thought
of
ramy
looked
at
her
in
surprise
why
not
well
i
do
know
she
moistened
her
twitching
lips
the
fact
is
i
ai
as
active
as
i
look
maybe
i
could
stand
the
care
i
ai
as
spry
as
evelina
nor
as
young
she
added
with
a
last
great
effort
but
you
do
most
of
de
work
here
anyways
said
her
suitor
doubtfully
oh
well
that
because
evelina
busy
outside
and
where
there
only
two
women
the
work
do
amount
to
much
besides
i
the
oldest
i
have
to
look
after
things
she
hastened
on
half
pained
that
her
simple
ruse
should
so
readily
deceive
him
well
i
guess
you
active
enough
for
me
he
persisted
his
calm
determination
began
to
frighten
her
she
trembled
lest
her
own
should
be
less
staunch
no
no
she
repeated
feeling
the
tears
on
her
lashes
i
could
ramy
i
could
marry
i
so
surprised
i
always
thought
it
was
evelina
always
and
so
did
everybody
else
she
so
bright
and
pretty
it
seemed
so
well
you
was
all
mistaken
said
ramy
obstinately
i
so
he
rose
pushing
back
his
chair
you
better
think
it
over
he
said
in
the
large
tone
of
a
man
who
feels
he
may
safely
wait
oh
no
no
it
ai
any
sorter
use
ramy
i
do
never
mean
to
marry
i
get
tired
so
easily
i
be
afraid
of
the
work
and
i
have
such
awful
she
paused
racking
her
brain
for
more
convincing
infirmities
headaches
do
you
said
ramy
turning
back
my
yes
awful
ones
that
i
have
to
give
right
up
to
evelina
has
to
do
everything
when
i
have
one
of
them
headaches
she
has
to
bring
me
my
tea
in
the
well
i
sorry
to
hear
it
said
ramy
thank
you
kindly
all
the
same
ann
eliza
murmured
and
please
do
do
she
stopped
suddenly
looking
at
him
through
her
tears
oh
that
all
right
he
answered
do
you
fret
miss
gunner
folks
have
got
to
suit
she
thought
his
tone
had
grown
more
resigned
since
she
had
spoken
of
her
headaches
for
some
moments
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
hesitating
eye
as
though
uncertain
how
to
end
their
conversation
and
at
length
she
found
courage
to
say
in
the
words
of
a
novel
she
had
once
read
i
want
this
should
make
any
difference
between
oh
my
no
said
ramy
absently
picking
up
his
hat
you
come
in
just
the
same
she
continued
nerving
herself
to
the
effort
we
miss
you
awfully
if
you
did
evelina
she
she
paused
torn
between
her
desire
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
evelina
and
the
dread
of
prematurely
disclosing
her
sister
secret
do
miss
evelina
have
no
headaches
ramy
suddenly
asked
my
no
never
well
not
to
speak
of
anyway
she
ai
had
one
for
ages
and
when
evelina
is
sick
she
wo
never
give
in
to
it
ann
eliza
declared
making
some
hurried
adjustments
with
her
conscience
i
would
have
thought
that
said
ramy
i
guess
you
do
know
us
as
well
as
you
thought
you
well
no
that
so
maybe
i
do
i
wish
you
good
day
miss
bunner
and
ramy
moved
toward
the
door
good
day
ramy
ann
eliza
answered
she
felt
unutterably
thankful
to
be
alone
she
knew
the
crucial
moment
of
her
life
had
passed
and
she
was
glad
that
she
had
not
fallen
below
her
own
ideals
it
had
been
a
wonderful
experience
and
in
spite
of
the
tears
on
her
cheeks
she
was
not
sorry
to
have
known
it
two
facts
however
took
the
edge
from
its
perfection
that
it
had
happened
in
the
shop
and
that
she
had
not
had
on
her
black
silk
she
passed
the
next
hour
in
a
state
of
dreamy
ecstasy
something
had
entered
into
her
life
of
which
no
subsequent
empoverishment
could
rob
it
she
glowed
with
the
same
rich
sense
of
possessorship
that
once
as
a
little
girl
she
had
felt
when
her
mother
had
given
her
a
gold
locket
and
she
had
sat
up
in
bed
in
the
dark
to
draw
it
from
its
beneath
her
at
length
a
dread
of
evelina
return
began
to
mingle
with
these
musings
how
could
she
meet
her
younger
sister
eye
without
betraying
what
had
happened
she
felt
as
though
a
visible
glory
lay
on
her
and
she
was
glad
that
dusk
had
fallen
when
evelina
entered
but
her
fears
were
superfluous
evelina
always
had
of
late
lost
all
interest
in
the
simple
happenings
of
the
shop
and
ann
eliza
with
mingled
mortification
and
relief
perceived
that
she
was
in
no
danger
of
being
as
to
the
events
of
the
afternoon
she
was
glad
of
this
yet
there
was
a
touch
of
humiliation
in
finding
that
the
portentous
secret
in
her
bosom
did
not
visibly
shine
forth
it
struck
her
as
dull
and
even
slightly
absurd
of
evelina
not
to
know
at
last
that
they
were
equals
part
ii
viii
ramy
after
a
decent
interval
returned
to
the
shop
and
ann
eliza
when
they
met
was
unable
to
detect
whether
the
emotions
which
seethed
under
her
black
alpaca
found
an
echo
in
his
bosom
outwardly
he
made
no
sign
he
lit
his
pipe
as
placidly
as
ever
and
seemed
to
relapse
without
effort
into
the
unruffled
intimacy
of
old
yet
to
ann
eliza
initiated
eye
a
change
became
gradually
perceptible
she
saw
that
he
was
beginning
to
look
at
her
sister
as
he
had
looked
at
her
on
that
momentous
afternoon
she
even
discerned
a
secret
significance
in
the
turn
of
his
talk
with
evelina
once
he
asked
her
abruptly
if
she
should
like
to
travel
and
ann
eliza
saw
that
the
flush
on
evelina
cheek
was
reflected
from
the
same
fire
which
had
scorched
her
own
so
they
drifted
on
through
the
sultry
weeks
of
july
at
that
season
the
business
of
the
little
shop
almost
ceased
and
one
saturday
morning
ramy
proposed
that
the
sisters
should
lock
up
early
and
go
with
him
for
a
sail
down
the
bay
in
one
of
the
coney
island
boats
ann
eliza
saw
the
light
in
evelina
eye
and
her
resolve
was
instantly
taken
i
guess
i
wo
go
thank
you
kindly
but
i
sure
my
sister
will
be
happy
she
was
pained
by
the
perfunctory
phrase
with
which
evelina
urged
her
to
accompany
them
and
still
more
by
ramy
silence
no
i
guess
i
wo
go
she
repeated
rather
in
answer
to
herself
than
to
them
it
dreadfully
hot
and
i
got
a
kinder
oh
well
i
would
then
said
her
sister
hurriedly
you
better
jest
set
here
quietly
and
yes
i
rest
ann
eliza
assented
at
two
ramy
returned
and
a
moment
later
he
and
evelina
left
the
shop
evelina
had
made
herself
another
new
bonnet
for
the
occasion
a
bonnet
ann
eliza
thought
almost
too
youthful
in
shape
and
colour
it
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
occurred
to
her
to
criticize
taste
and
she
was
frightened
at
the
insidious
change
in
her
attitude
toward
her
sister
when
ann
eliza
in
later
days
looked
back
on
that
afternoon
she
felt
that
there
had
been
something
prophetic
in
the
quality
of
its
solitude
it
seemed
to
distill
the
triple
essence
of
loneliness
in
which
all
her
was
to
be
lived
no
purchasers
came
not
a
hand
fell
on
the
and
the
tick
of
the
clock
in
the
back
room
ironically
emphasized
the
passing
of
the
empty
hours
evelina
returned
late
and
alone
ann
eliza
felt
the
coming
crisis
in
the
sound
of
her
footstep
which
wavered
along
as
if
not
knowing
on
what
it
trod
the
elder
sister
affection
had
so
passionately
projected
itself
into
her
junior
fate
that
at
such
moments
she
seemed
to
be
living
two
lives
her
own
and
evelina
and
her
private
longings
shrank
into
silence
at
the
sight
of
the
other
hungry
bliss
but
it
was
evident
that
evelina
never
acutely
alive
to
the
emotional
atmosphere
about
her
had
no
idea
that
her
secret
was
suspected
and
with
an
assumption
of
unconcern
that
would
have
made
ann
eliza
smile
if
the
pang
had
been
less
piercing
the
younger
sister
prepared
to
confess
herself
what
are
you
so
busy
about
she
said
impatiently
as
ann
eliza
beneath
the
fumbled
for
the
matches
ai
you
even
got
time
to
ask
me
if
i
had
a
pleasant
day
ann
eliza
turned
with
a
quiet
smile
i
guess
i
do
have
to
seems
to
me
it
pretty
plain
you
well
i
do
know
i
do
know
how
i
feel
it
all
so
queer
i
almost
think
i
like
to
i
guess
you
no
i
ai
it
not
that
but
it
all
happened
so
suddenly
and
the
boat
was
so
crowded
i
thought
everybody
hear
what
he
was
ann
eliza
she
broke
out
why
on
earth
do
you
ask
me
what
i
talking
about
ann
eliza
with
a
last
effort
of
heroism
feigned
a
fond
incomprehension
what
are
you
why
i
engaged
to
be
married
so
there
now
it
out
and
it
happened
right
on
the
boat
only
to
think
of
it
of
course
i
was
exactly
surprised
i
known
right
along
he
was
going
to
sooner
or
later
somehow
i
did
think
of
its
happening
i
thought
he
never
get
up
his
courage
he
said
he
was
so
i
say
no
that
what
him
so
long
from
asking
me
well
i
ai
said
yes
yet
leastways
i
told
him
i
have
to
think
it
over
but
i
guess
he
knows
oh
ann
eliza
so
happy
she
hid
the
blinding
brightness
of
her
face
ann
eliza
just
then
would
only
let
herself
feel
that
she
was
glad
she
drew
down
evelina
hands
and
kissed
her
and
they
held
each
other
when
evelina
regained
her
voice
she
had
a
tale
to
tell
which
carried
their
vigil
far
into
the
night
not
a
syllable
not
a
glance
or
gesture
of
ramy
was
the
elder
sister
spared
and
with
unconscious
irony
she
found
herself
comparing
the
details
of
his
proposal
to
her
with
those
which
evelina
was
imparting
with
merciless
prolixity
the
next
few
days
were
taken
up
with
the
embarrassed
adjustment
of
their
new
relation
to
ramy
and
to
each
other
ann
eliza
ardour
carried
her
to
new
heights
of
and
she
invented
late
duties
in
the
shop
in
order
to
leave
evelina
and
her
suitor
longer
alone
in
the
back
room
later
on
when
she
tried
to
remember
the
details
of
those
first
days
few
came
back
to
her
she
knew
only
that
she
got
up
each
morning
with
the
sense
of
having
to
push
the
leaden
hours
up
the
same
long
steep
of
pain
ramy
came
daily
now
every
evening
he
and
his
betrothed
went
out
for
a
stroll
around
the
square
and
when
evelina
came
in
her
cheeks
were
always
pink
he
kissed
her
under
that
tree
at
the
corner
away
from
the
ann
eliza
said
to
herself
with
sudden
insight
into
unconjectured
things
on
sundays
they
usually
went
for
the
whole
afternoon
to
the
central
park
and
ann
eliza
from
her
seat
in
the
mortal
hush
of
the
back
room
followed
step
by
step
their
long
slow
beatific
walk
there
had
been
as
yet
no
allusion
to
their
marriage
except
that
evelina
had
once
told
her
sister
that
ramy
wished
them
to
invite
hochmuller
and
linda
to
the
wedding
the
mention
of
the
laundress
raised
a
fear
in
ann
eliza
and
she
said
in
a
tone
of
tentative
appeal
i
guess
if
i
was
you
i
would
want
to
be
very
great
friends
with
evelina
glanced
at
her
compassionately
i
guess
if
you
was
me
want
to
do
everything
you
could
to
please
the
man
you
loved
lucky
she
added
with
glacial
irony
that
i
not
too
grand
for
herman
oh
ann
eliza
protested
that
ai
what
i
mean
and
you
know
it
ai
only
somehow
the
day
we
saw
her
i
did
think
she
seemed
like
the
kinder
person
you
want
for
a
i
guess
a
married
woman
the
best
judge
of
such
matters
evelina
replied
as
though
she
already
walked
in
the
light
of
her
future
state
ann
eliza
after
that
kept
her
own
counsel
she
saw
that
evelina
wanted
her
sympathy
as
little
as
her
admonitions
and
that
already
she
counted
for
nothing
in
her
sister
scheme
of
life
to
ann
eliza
idolatrous
acceptance
of
the
cruelties
of
fate
this
exclusion
seemed
both
natural
and
just
but
it
caused
her
the
most
lively
pain
she
could
not
divest
her
love
for
evelina
of
its
passionate
motherliness
no
breath
of
reason
could
lower
it
to
the
cool
temperature
of
sisterly
affection
she
was
then
passing
as
she
thought
through
the
novitiate
of
her
pain
preparing
in
a
hundred
experimental
ways
for
the
solitude
awaiting
her
when
evelina
left
it
was
true
that
it
would
be
a
tempered
loneliness
they
would
not
be
far
apart
evelina
would
run
in
daily
from
the
they
would
doubtless
take
supper
with
her
on
sundays
but
already
ann
eliza
guessed
with
what
growing
perfunctoriness
her
sister
would
fulfill
these
obligations
she
even
foresaw
the
day
when
to
get
news
of
evelina
she
should
have
to
lock
the
shop
at
nightfall
and
go
herself
to
ramy
door
but
on
that
contingency
she
would
not
dwell
they
can
come
to
me
when
they
want
to
they
always
find
me
here
she
simply
said
to
herself
one
evening
evelina
came
in
flushed
and
agitated
from
her
stroll
around
the
square
ann
eliza
saw
at
once
that
something
had
happened
but
the
new
habit
of
reticence
checked
her
question
she
had
not
long
to
wait
oh
ann
eliza
to
think
what
he
says
the
pronoun
stood
exclusively
for
ramy
i
declare
i
so
upset
i
thought
the
people
in
the
square
would
notice
me
do
i
look
queer
he
wants
to
get
married
right
off
this
very
next
next
week
yes
so
we
can
move
out
to
louis
right
him
and
you
move
out
to
louis
well
i
do
know
as
it
would
be
natural
for
him
to
want
to
go
out
there
without
me
evelina
simpered
but
it
all
so
sudden
i
know
what
to
think
he
only
got
the
letter
this
morning
i
do
i
look
queer
ann
eliza
her
eye
was
roving
for
the
mirror
no
you
do
said
ann
eliza
almost
harshly
well
it
a
mercy
evelina
pursued
with
a
tinge
of
disappointment
it
a
regular
miracle
i
did
faint
right
out
there
in
the
square
herman
so
thoughtless
he
just
put
the
letter
into
my
hand
without
a
word
it
from
a
big
firm
out
there
the
of
louis
he
says
it
is
offering
him
a
place
in
their
seems
they
heard
of
him
through
a
german
friend
of
his
that
settled
out
there
it
a
splendid
opening
and
if
he
gives
satisfaction
they
raise
him
at
the
end
of
the
she
paused
flushed
with
the
importance
of
the
situation
which
seemed
to
lift
her
once
for
all
above
the
dull
level
of
her
former
life
then
you
have
to
go
came
at
last
from
ann
eliza
evelina
stared
you
would
have
me
interfere
with
his
prospects
would
you
no
no
i
meant
has
it
got
to
be
so
soon
right
away
i
tell
you
next
week
ai
it
awful
blushed
the
bride
well
this
was
what
happened
to
mothers
they
bore
it
ann
eliza
mused
so
why
not
she
ah
but
they
had
their
own
chance
first
she
had
had
no
chance
at
all
and
now
this
life
which
she
had
made
her
own
was
going
from
her
forever
had
gone
already
in
the
inner
and
deeper
sense
and
was
soon
to
vanish
in
even
its
outward
nearness
its
of
voice
and
eye
at
that
moment
even
the
thought
of
evelina
happiness
refused
her
its
consolatory
ray
or
its
light
if
she
saw
it
was
too
remote
to
warm
her
the
thirst
for
a
personal
and
inalienable
tie
for
pangs
and
problems
of
her
own
was
parching
ann
eliza
soul
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
never
again
gather
strength
to
look
her
loneliness
in
the
face
the
trivial
obligations
of
the
moment
came
to
her
aid
nursed
in
idleness
her
grief
would
have
mastered
her
but
the
needs
of
the
shop
and
the
back
room
and
the
preparations
for
evelina
marriage
kept
the
tyrant
under
miss
mellins
true
to
her
anticipations
had
been
called
on
to
aid
in
the
making
of
the
wedding
dress
and
she
and
ann
eliza
were
bending
one
evening
over
the
breadths
of
cashmere
which
in
spite
of
the
prophetic
vision
of
gored
satin
had
been
judged
most
suitable
when
evelina
came
into
the
room
alone
ann
eliza
had
already
had
occasion
to
notice
that
it
was
a
bad
sign
when
ramy
left
his
affianced
at
the
door
it
generally
meant
that
evelina
had
something
disturbing
to
communicate
and
ann
eliza
first
glance
told
her
that
this
time
the
news
was
grave
miss
mellins
who
sat
with
her
back
to
the
door
and
her
head
bent
over
her
sewing
started
as
evelina
came
around
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
mercy
miss
evelina
i
declare
i
thought
you
was
a
ghost
the
way
you
crep
in
i
had
a
customer
once
up
in
street
a
lovely
young
woman
with
a
bust
and
a
waist
you
could
ha
put
into
her
wedding
ring
and
her
husband
he
crep
up
behind
her
that
way
jest
for
a
joke
and
frightened
her
into
a
fit
and
when
she
come
to
she
was
a
raving
maniac
and
had
to
be
taken
to
bloomingdale
with
two
doctors
and
a
nurse
to
hold
her
in
the
carriage
and
a
lovely
baby
six
weeks
old
and
there
she
is
to
this
day
poor
i
did
mean
to
startle
you
said
evelina
she
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
as
the
fell
on
her
face
ann
eliza
saw
that
she
had
been
crying
you
do
look
miss
mellins
resumed
after
a
pause
of
scrutiny
i
guess
ramy
lugs
you
round
that
square
too
often
you
walk
your
legs
off
if
you
ai
careful
men
do
never
consider
they
all
alike
why
i
had
a
cousin
once
that
was
engaged
to
a
maybe
we
better
put
away
the
work
for
miss
mellins
ann
eliza
interposed
i
guess
what
evelina
wants
is
a
good
night
that
so
assented
the
have
you
got
the
back
breadths
run
together
miss
bunner
here
the
sleeves
i
pin
she
drew
a
cluster
of
pins
from
her
mouth
in
which
she
seemed
to
secrete
them
as
squirrels
stow
away
nuts
there
she
said
rolling
up
her
work
you
go
right
away
to
bed
miss
evelina
and
we
set
up
a
little
later
night
i
guess
you
a
mite
nervous
ai
you
i
know
when
my
turn
comes
i
be
scared
to
with
this
arch
forecast
she
withdrew
and
ann
eliza
returning
to
the
back
room
found
evelina
still
listlessly
seated
by
the
table
true
to
her
new
policy
of
silence
the
elder
sister
set
about
folding
up
the
bridal
dress
but
suddenly
evelina
said
in
a
harsh
unnatural
voice
there
ai
any
use
in
going
on
with
the
folds
slipped
from
ann
eliza
hands
evelina
bunner
what
you
mean
jest
what
i
say
it
put
put
off
what
put
off
our
getting
married
he
ca
take
me
to
louis
he
ai
got
money
she
brought
the
words
out
in
the
monotonous
tone
of
a
child
reciting
a
lesson
ann
eliza
picked
up
another
breadth
of
cashmere
and
began
to
smooth
it
out
i
do
understand
she
said
at
length
well
it
plain
enough
the
journey
fearfully
expensive
and
got
to
have
something
left
to
start
with
when
we
get
out
there
counted
up
and
he
ai
got
the
money
to
do
it
that
but
i
thought
he
was
going
right
into
a
splendid
so
he
is
but
the
salary
pretty
low
the
first
year
and
board
very
high
in
louis
he
jest
got
another
letter
from
his
german
friend
and
he
been
figuring
it
out
and
he
afraid
to
chance
it
he
have
to
go
but
there
your
money
have
you
forgotten
that
the
hundred
dollars
in
the
evelina
made
an
impatient
movement
of
course
i
ai
forgotten
it
it
ai
enough
it
would
all
have
to
go
into
buying
furniture
and
if
he
was
took
sick
and
lost
his
place
again
we
would
have
a
cent
left
he
says
he
got
to
lay
by
another
hundred
dollars
before
he
be
willing
to
take
me
out
for
a
while
ann
eliza
pondered
this
surprising
statement
then
she
ventured
seems
to
me
he
might
have
thought
of
it
in
an
instant
evelina
was
aflame
i
guess
he
knows
what
right
as
well
as
you
or
me
i
sooner
die
than
be
a
burden
to
ann
eliza
made
no
answer
the
clutch
of
an
unformulated
doubt
had
checked
the
words
on
her
lips
she
had
meant
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
to
give
evelina
the
other
half
of
their
common
savings
but
something
warned
her
not
to
say
so
now
the
sisters
undressed
without
farther
words
after
they
had
gone
to
bed
and
the
light
had
been
put
out
the
sound
of
evelina
weeping
came
to
ann
eliza
in
the
darkness
but
she
lay
motionless
on
her
own
side
of
the
bed
out
of
contact
with
her
sister
shaken
body
never
had
she
felt
so
coldly
remote
from
evelina
the
hours
of
the
night
moved
slowly
ticked
off
with
wearisome
insistence
by
the
clock
which
had
played
so
prominent
a
part
in
their
lives
evelina
sobs
still
stirred
the
bed
at
gradually
lengthening
intervals
till
at
length
ann
eliza
thought
she
slept
but
with
the
dawn
the
eyes
of
the
sisters
met
and
ann
eliza
courage
failed
her
as
she
looked
in
evelina
face
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
put
out
a
pleading
hand
do
cry
so
dearie
oh
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
bear
it
evelina
moaned
ann
eliza
stroked
her
quivering
shoulder
do
do
she
repeated
if
you
take
the
other
hundred
wo
that
be
enough
i
always
meant
to
give
it
to
you
i
did
want
to
tell
you
till
your
wedding
ix
evelina
marriage
took
place
on
the
appointed
day
it
was
celebrated
in
the
evening
in
the
chantry
of
the
church
which
the
sisters
attended
and
after
it
was
over
the
few
guests
who
had
been
present
repaired
to
the
bunner
sisters
basement
where
a
wedding
supper
awaited
them
ann
eliza
aided
by
miss
mellins
and
hawkins
and
consciously
supported
by
the
sentimental
interest
of
the
whole
street
had
expended
her
utmost
energy
on
the
decoration
of
the
shop
and
the
back
room
on
the
table
a
vase
of
white
chrysanthemums
stood
between
a
dish
of
oranges
and
bananas
and
an
iced
wreathed
with
of
the
own
making
autumn
leaves
studded
with
paper
roses
festooned
the
and
the
chromo
of
the
rock
of
ages
and
a
wreath
of
yellow
immortelles
was
twined
about
the
clock
which
evelina
revered
as
the
mysterious
agent
of
her
happiness
at
the
table
sat
miss
mellins
profusely
spangled
and
bangled
her
head
a
pale
young
thing
who
had
helped
with
evelina
outfit
and
hawkins
with
johnny
their
eldest
boy
and
hochmuller
and
her
daughter
hochmuller
large
blonde
personality
seemed
to
pervade
the
room
to
the
effacement
of
the
less
guests
it
was
rendered
more
impressive
by
a
dress
of
crimson
poplin
that
stood
out
from
her
in
folds
and
linda
whom
ann
eliza
had
remembered
as
an
uncouth
child
with
a
sly
look
about
the
eyes
surprised
her
by
a
sudden
blossoming
into
feminine
grace
such
as
sometimes
follows
on
a
gawky
girlhood
the
hochmullers
in
fact
struck
the
dominant
note
in
the
entertainment
beside
them
evelina
unusually
pale
in
her
grey
cashmere
and
white
bonnet
looked
like
a
faintly
washed
sketch
beside
a
brilliant
chromo
and
ramy
doomed
to
the
traditional
insignificance
of
the
bridegroom
part
made
no
attempt
to
rise
above
his
situation
even
miss
mellins
sparkled
and
jingled
in
vain
in
the
shadow
of
hochmuller
crimson
bulk
and
ann
eliza
with
a
sense
of
vague
foreboding
saw
that
the
wedding
feast
centred
about
the
two
guests
she
had
most
wished
to
exclude
from
it
what
was
said
or
done
while
they
all
sat
about
the
table
she
never
afterward
recalled
the
long
hours
remained
in
her
memory
as
a
whirl
of
high
colours
and
loud
voices
from
which
the
pale
presence
of
evelina
now
and
then
emerged
like
a
drowned
face
on
a
sea
the
next
morning
ramy
and
his
wife
started
for
louis
and
ann
eliza
was
left
alone
outwardly
the
first
strain
of
parting
was
tempered
by
the
arrival
of
miss
mellins
hawkins
and
johnny
who
dropped
in
to
help
in
the
ungarlanding
and
tidying
up
of
the
back
room
ann
eliza
was
duly
grateful
for
their
kindness
but
the
talking
over
on
which
they
had
evidently
counted
was
dead
sea
fruit
on
her
lips
and
just
beyond
the
familiar
warmth
of
their
presences
she
saw
the
form
of
solitude
at
her
door
ann
eliza
was
but
a
small
person
to
harbour
so
great
a
guest
and
a
trembling
sense
of
insufficiency
possessed
her
she
had
no
high
musings
to
offer
to
the
new
companion
of
her
hearth
every
one
of
her
thoughts
had
hitherto
turned
to
evelina
and
shaped
itself
in
homely
easy
words
of
the
mighty
speech
of
silence
she
knew
not
the
earliest
syllable
everything
in
the
back
room
and
the
shop
on
the
second
day
after
evelina
going
seemed
to
have
grown
coldly
unfamiliar
the
whole
aspect
of
the
place
had
changed
with
the
changed
conditions
of
ann
eliza
life
the
first
customer
who
opened
the
startled
her
like
a
ghost
and
all
night
she
lay
tossing
on
her
side
of
the
bed
sinking
now
and
then
into
an
uncertain
doze
from
which
she
would
suddenly
wake
to
reach
out
her
hand
for
evelina
in
the
new
silence
surrounding
her
the
walls
and
furniture
found
voice
frightening
her
at
dusk
and
midnight
with
strange
sighs
and
stealthy
whispers
ghostly
hands
shook
the
window
shutters
or
rattled
at
the
outer
latch
and
once
she
grew
cold
at
the
sound
of
a
step
like
evelina
stealing
through
the
dark
shop
to
die
out
on
the
threshold
in
time
of
course
she
found
an
explanation
for
these
noises
telling
herself
that
the
bedstead
was
warping
that
miss
mellins
trod
heavily
overhead
or
that
the
thunder
of
passing
shook
the
but
the
hours
leading
up
to
these
conclusions
were
full
of
the
floating
terrors
that
harden
into
fixed
foreboding
worst
of
all
were
the
solitary
meals
when
she
absently
continued
to
set
aside
the
largest
slice
of
pie
for
evelina
and
to
let
the
tea
grow
cold
while
she
waited
for
her
sister
to
help
herself
to
the
first
cup
miss
mellins
coming
in
on
one
of
these
sad
repasts
suggested
the
acquisition
of
a
cat
but
ann
eliza
shook
her
head
she
had
never
been
used
to
animals
and
she
felt
the
vague
shrinking
of
the
pious
from
creatures
divided
from
her
by
the
abyss
of
soullessness
at
length
after
ten
empty
days
evelina
first
letter
came
my
dear
sister
she
wrote
in
her
pinched
spencerian
hand
it
seems
strange
to
be
in
this
great
city
so
far
from
home
alone
with
him
i
have
chosen
for
life
but
marriage
has
its
solemn
duties
which
those
who
are
not
can
never
hope
to
understand
and
happier
perhaps
for
this
reason
life
for
them
has
only
simple
tasks
and
pleasures
but
those
who
must
take
thought
for
others
must
be
prepared
to
do
their
duty
in
whatever
station
it
has
pleased
the
almighty
to
call
them
not
that
i
have
cause
to
complain
my
dear
husband
is
all
love
and
devotion
but
being
absent
all
day
at
his
business
how
can
i
help
but
feel
lonesome
at
times
as
the
poet
says
it
is
hard
for
they
that
love
to
live
apart
and
i
often
wonder
my
dear
sister
how
you
are
getting
along
alone
in
the
store
may
you
never
experience
the
feelings
of
solitude
i
have
underwent
since
i
came
here
we
are
boarding
now
but
soon
expect
to
find
rooms
and
change
our
place
of
residence
then
i
shall
have
all
the
care
of
a
household
to
bear
but
such
is
the
fate
of
those
who
join
their
lot
with
others
they
can
not
hope
to
escape
from
the
burdens
of
life
nor
would
i
ask
it
i
would
not
live
alway
but
while
i
live
would
always
pray
for
strength
to
do
my
duty
this
city
is
not
near
as
large
or
handsome
as
new
york
but
had
my
lot
been
cast
in
a
wilderness
i
hope
i
should
not
repine
such
never
was
my
nature
and
they
who
exchange
their
independence
for
the
sweet
name
of
wife
must
be
prepared
to
find
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
nor
i
would
not
expect
like
you
to
drift
down
the
stream
of
life
unfettered
and
serene
as
a
summer
cloud
such
is
not
my
fate
but
come
what
may
will
always
find
in
me
a
resigned
and
prayerful
spirit
and
hoping
this
finds
you
as
well
as
it
leaves
me
i
remain
my
dear
sister
yours
truly
evelina
ann
eliza
had
always
secretly
admired
the
oratorical
and
impersonal
tone
of
evelina
letters
but
the
few
she
had
previously
read
having
been
addressed
to
or
distant
relatives
had
appeared
in
the
light
of
literary
compositions
rather
than
as
records
of
personal
experience
now
she
could
not
but
wish
that
evelina
had
laid
aside
her
swelling
periods
for
a
style
more
suited
to
the
chronicling
of
homely
incidents
she
read
the
letter
again
and
again
seeking
for
a
clue
to
what
her
sister
was
really
doing
and
thinking
but
after
each
reading
she
emerged
impressed
but
unenlightened
from
the
labyrinth
of
eloquence
during
the
early
winter
she
received
two
or
three
more
letters
of
the
same
kind
each
enclosing
in
its
loose
husk
of
rhetoric
a
smaller
kernel
of
fact
by
dint
of
patient
interlinear
study
ann
eliza
gathered
from
them
that
evelina
and
her
husband
after
various
costly
experiments
in
boarding
had
been
reduced
to
a
flat
that
living
in
louis
was
more
expensive
than
they
had
supposed
and
that
ramy
was
kept
out
late
at
night
why
at
a
jeweller
ann
eliza
wondered
and
found
his
position
less
satisfactory
than
he
had
been
led
to
expect
toward
february
the
letters
fell
off
and
finally
they
ceased
to
come
at
first
ann
eliza
wrote
shyly
but
persistently
entreating
for
more
frequent
news
then
as
one
appeal
after
another
was
swallowed
up
in
the
mystery
of
evelina
protracted
silence
vague
fears
began
to
assail
the
elder
sister
perhaps
evelina
was
ill
and
with
no
one
to
nurse
her
but
a
man
who
could
not
even
make
himself
a
cup
of
tea
ann
eliza
recalled
the
layer
of
dust
in
ramy
shop
and
pictures
of
domestic
disorder
mingled
with
the
more
poignant
vision
of
her
sister
illness
but
surely
if
evelina
were
ill
ramy
would
have
written
he
wrote
a
small
neat
hand
and
epistolary
communication
was
not
an
insuperable
embarrassment
to
him
the
too
probable
alternative
was
that
both
the
unhappy
pair
had
been
prostrated
by
some
disease
which
left
them
powerless
to
summon
her
for
summon
her
they
surely
would
ann
eliza
with
unconscious
cynicism
reflected
if
she
or
her
small
economies
could
be
of
use
to
them
the
more
she
strained
her
eyes
into
the
mystery
the
darker
it
grew
and
her
lack
of
initiative
her
inability
to
imagine
what
steps
might
be
taken
to
trace
the
lost
in
distant
places
left
her
benumbed
and
helpless
at
last
there
floated
up
from
some
depth
of
troubled
memory
the
name
of
the
firm
of
louis
jewellers
by
whom
ramy
was
employed
after
much
hesitation
and
considerable
effort
she
addressed
to
them
a
timid
request
for
news
of
her
and
sooner
than
she
could
have
hoped
the
answer
reached
her
dear
madam
in
reply
to
yours
of
the
ult
we
beg
to
state
the
party
you
refer
to
was
discharged
from
our
employ
a
month
ago
we
are
sorry
we
are
unable
to
furnish
you
wish
his
address
yours
respectfully
ludwig
and
ann
eliza
read
and
the
curt
statement
in
a
stupor
of
distress
she
had
lost
her
last
trace
of
evelina
all
that
night
she
lay
awake
revolving
the
stupendous
project
of
going
to
louis
in
search
of
her
sister
but
though
she
pieced
together
her
few
financial
possibilities
with
the
ingenuity
of
a
brain
used
to
fitting
odd
scraps
into
quilts
she
woke
to
the
cold
daylight
fact
that
she
could
not
raise
the
money
for
her
fare
her
wedding
gift
to
evelina
had
left
her
without
any
resources
beyond
her
daily
earnings
and
these
had
steadily
dwindled
as
the
winter
passed
she
had
long
since
renounced
her
weekly
visit
to
the
butcher
and
had
reduced
her
other
expenses
to
the
narrowest
measure
but
the
most
systematic
frugality
had
not
enabled
her
to
put
by
any
money
in
spite
of
her
dogged
efforts
to
maintain
the
prosperity
of
the
little
shop
her
sister
absence
had
already
told
on
its
business
now
that
ann
eliza
had
to
carry
the
bundles
to
the
dyer
herself
the
customers
who
called
in
her
absence
finding
the
shop
locked
too
often
went
elsewhere
moreover
after
several
stern
but
unavailing
efforts
she
had
had
to
give
up
the
trimming
of
bonnets
which
in
evelina
hands
had
been
the
most
lucrative
as
well
as
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
business
this
change
to
the
passing
female
eye
robbed
the
shop
window
of
its
chief
attraction
and
when
painful
experience
had
convinced
the
regular
customers
of
the
bunner
sisters
of
ann
eliza
lack
of
millinery
skill
they
began
to
lose
faith
in
her
ability
to
curl
a
feather
or
even
freshen
up
a
bunch
of
flowers
the
time
came
when
ann
eliza
had
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
to
the
lady
with
puffed
sleeves
who
had
always
looked
at
her
so
kindly
and
had
once
ordered
a
hat
of
evelina
perhaps
the
lady
with
puffed
sleeves
would
be
able
to
get
her
a
little
plain
sewing
to
do
or
she
might
recommend
the
shop
to
friends
ann
eliza
with
this
possibility
in
view
rummaged
out
of
a
drawer
the
remainder
of
the
business
cards
which
the
sisters
had
ordered
in
the
first
flush
of
their
commercial
adventure
but
when
the
lady
with
puffed
sleeves
finally
appeared
she
was
in
deep
mourning
and
wore
so
sad
a
look
that
ann
eliza
dared
not
speak
she
came
in
to
buy
some
spools
of
black
thread
and
silk
and
in
the
doorway
she
turned
back
to
say
i
am
going
away
for
a
long
time
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
and
the
door
shut
on
her
one
day
not
long
after
this
it
occurred
to
ann
eliza
to
go
to
hoboken
in
quest
of
hochmuller
much
as
she
shrank
from
pouring
her
distress
into
that
particular
ear
her
anxiety
had
carried
her
beyond
such
reluctance
but
when
she
began
to
think
the
matter
over
she
was
faced
by
a
new
difficulty
on
the
occasion
of
her
only
visit
to
hochmuller
she
and
evelina
had
suffered
themselves
to
be
led
there
by
ramy
and
ann
eliza
now
perceived
that
she
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
laundress
suburb
much
less
that
of
the
street
in
which
she
lived
but
she
must
have
news
of
evelina
and
no
obstacle
was
great
enough
to
thwart
her
though
she
longed
to
turn
to
some
one
for
advice
she
disliked
to
expose
her
situation
to
miss
mellins
searching
eye
and
at
first
she
could
think
of
no
other
confidant
then
she
remembered
hawkins
or
rather
her
husband
who
though
ann
eliza
had
always
thought
him
a
dull
uneducated
man
was
probably
gifted
with
the
mysterious
masculine
faculty
of
finding
out
people
addresses
it
went
hard
with
ann
eliza
to
trust
her
secret
even
to
the
mild
ear
of
hawkins
but
at
least
she
was
spared
the
to
which
the
would
have
subjected
her
the
accumulating
pressure
of
domestic
cares
had
so
crushed
in
hawkins
any
curiosity
concerning
the
affairs
of
others
that
she
received
her
visitor
confidence
with
an
almost
masculine
indifference
while
she
rocked
her
teething
baby
on
one
arm
and
with
the
other
tried
to
check
the
acrobatic
impulses
of
the
next
in
age
my
my
she
simply
said
as
ann
eliza
ended
keep
still
now
arthur
miss
bunner
do
want
you
to
jump
up
and
down
on
her
foot
and
what
are
you
gaping
at
johnny
run
right
off
and
play
she
added
turning
sternly
to
her
eldest
who
because
he
was
the
least
naughty
usually
bore
the
brunt
of
her
wrath
against
the
others
well
perhaps
hawkins
can
help
you
hawkins
continued
meditatively
while
the
children
after
scattering
at
her
bidding
returned
to
their
previous
pursuits
like
flies
settling
down
on
the
spot
from
which
an
exasperated
hand
has
swept
them
i
send
him
right
round
the
minute
he
comes
in
and
you
can
tell
him
the
whole
story
i
would
wonder
but
what
he
can
find
that
hochmuller
address
in
the
i
know
they
got
one
where
he
i
be
real
thankful
if
he
could
ann
eliza
murmured
rising
from
her
seat
with
the
factitious
sense
of
lightness
that
comes
from
imparting
a
dread
x
hawkins
proved
himself
worthy
of
his
wife
faith
in
his
capacity
he
learned
from
ann
eliza
as
much
as
she
could
tell
him
about
hochmuller
and
returned
the
next
evening
with
a
scrap
of
paper
bearing
her
address
beneath
which
johnny
the
family
scribe
had
written
in
a
large
round
hand
the
names
of
the
streets
that
led
there
from
the
ferry
ann
eliza
lay
awake
all
that
night
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
directions
hawkins
had
given
her
he
was
a
kind
man
and
she
knew
he
would
willingly
have
gone
with
her
to
hoboken
indeed
she
read
in
his
timid
eye
the
intention
of
offering
to
accompany
her
but
on
such
an
errand
she
preferred
to
go
alone
the
next
sunday
accordingly
she
set
out
early
and
without
much
trouble
found
her
way
to
the
ferry
nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
her
previous
visit
to
hochmuller
and
a
chilly
april
breeze
smote
her
face
as
she
stepped
on
the
boat
most
of
the
passengers
were
huddled
together
in
the
cabin
and
ann
eliza
shrank
into
its
obscurest
corner
shivering
under
the
thin
black
mantle
which
had
seemed
so
hot
in
july
she
began
to
feel
a
little
bewildered
as
she
stepped
ashore
but
a
paternal
policeman
put
her
into
the
right
car
and
as
in
a
dream
she
found
herself
retracing
the
way
to
hochmuller
door
she
had
told
the
conductor
the
name
of
the
street
at
which
she
wished
to
get
out
and
presently
she
stood
in
the
biting
wind
at
the
corner
near
the
where
the
sun
had
once
beat
down
on
her
so
fiercely
at
length
an
empty
car
appeared
its
yellow
flank
emblazoned
with
the
name
of
hochmuller
suburb
and
ann
eliza
was
presently
jolting
past
the
narrow
brick
houses
islanded
between
vacant
lots
like
giant
piles
in
a
desolate
lagoon
when
the
car
reached
the
end
of
its
journey
she
got
out
and
stood
for
some
time
trying
to
remember
which
turn
ramy
had
taken
she
had
just
made
up
her
mind
to
ask
the
when
he
shook
the
reins
on
the
backs
of
his
lean
horses
and
the
car
still
empty
jogged
away
toward
hoboken
ann
eliza
left
alone
by
the
roadside
began
to
move
cautiously
forward
looking
about
for
a
small
red
house
with
a
gable
overhung
by
an
but
everything
about
her
seemed
unfamiliar
and
forbidding
one
or
two
surly
looking
men
slouched
past
with
inquisitive
glances
and
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
stop
and
speak
to
them
at
length
a
boy
came
out
of
a
swinging
door
suggestive
of
illicit
conviviality
and
to
him
ann
eliza
ventured
to
confide
her
difficulty
the
offer
of
five
cents
fired
him
with
an
instant
willingness
to
lead
her
to
hochmuller
and
he
was
soon
trotting
past
the
yard
with
ann
eliza
in
his
wake
another
turn
in
the
road
brought
them
to
the
little
red
house
and
having
rewarded
her
guide
ann
eliza
unlatched
the
gate
and
walked
up
to
the
door
her
heart
was
beating
violently
and
she
had
to
lean
against
the
to
compose
her
twitching
lips
she
had
not
known
till
that
moment
how
much
it
was
going
to
hurt
her
to
speak
of
evelina
to
hochmuller
as
her
agitation
subsided
she
began
to
notice
how
much
the
appearance
of
the
house
had
changed
it
was
not
only
that
winter
had
stripped
the
elm
and
blackened
the
the
house
itself
had
a
debased
and
deserted
air
the
were
cracked
and
dirty
and
one
or
two
shutters
swung
dismally
on
loosened
hinges
she
rang
several
times
before
the
door
was
opened
at
length
an
irish
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
a
baby
in
her
arms
appeared
on
the
threshold
and
glancing
past
her
into
the
narrow
passage
ann
eliza
saw
that
hochmuller
neat
abode
had
deteriorated
as
much
within
as
without
at
the
mention
of
the
name
the
woman
stared
mrs
who
did
ye
say
mrs
hochmuller

is
surely
her
house
no

said
the
woman
turning
away

eliza
entreated

hochmuller
who

the
baby
who

mouth
for
a
howl

knees
grew
weak

somewhere

woman

an
irate

oh
please

ann
eliza
insisted
you
see
i
must
find
why
do
ye
go
and
look
for
her
thin
the
woman
returned
slamming
the
door
in
her
face
she
stood
motionless
on
the
dazed
by
the
immensity
of
her
disappointment
till
a
burst
of
loud
voices
inside
the
house
drove
her
down
the
path
and
out
of
the
gate
even
then
she
could
not
grasp
what
had
happened
and
pausing
in
the
road
she
looked
back
at
the
house
half
hoping
that
hochmuller
once
detested
face
might
appear
at
one
of
the
grimy
windows
she
was
roused
by
an
icy
wind
that
seemed
to
spring
up
suddenly
from
the
desolate
scene
piercing
her
thin
dress
like
gauze
and
turning
away
she
began
to
retrace
her
steps
she
thought
of
enquiring
for
hochmuller
at
some
of
the
neighbouring
houses
but
their
look
was
so
unfriendly
that
she
walked
on
without
making
up
her
mind
at
which
door
to
ring
when
she
reached
the
terminus
a
car
was
just
moving
off
toward
hoboken
and
for
nearly
an
hour
she
had
to
wait
on
the
corner
in
the
bitter
wind
her
hands
and
feet
were
stiff
with
cold
when
the
car
at
length
loomed
into
sight
again
and
she
thought
of
stopping
somewhere
on
the
way
to
the
ferry
for
a
cup
of
tea
but
before
the
region
of
was
reached
she
had
grown
so
sick
and
dizzy
that
the
thought
of
food
was
repulsive
at
length
she
found
herself
on
the
in
the
soothing
stuffiness
of
the
crowded
cabin
then
came
another
interval
of
shivering
on
a
another
long
jolting
journey
in
a
car
that
smelt
of
damp
straw
and
tobacco
and
lastly
in
the
cold
spring
dusk
she
unlocked
her
door
and
groped
her
way
through
the
shop
to
her
fireless
bedroom
the
next
morning
hawkins
dropping
in
to
hear
the
result
of
the
trip
found
ann
eliza
sitting
behind
the
counter
wrapped
in
an
old
shawl
why
miss
bunner
you
sick
you
must
have
fever
your
face
is
just
as
red
it
nothing
i
guess
i
caught
cold
yesterday
on
the
ann
eliza
acknowledged
and
it
jest
like
a
vault
in
here
hawkins
rebuked
her
let
me
feel
your
hand
it
burning
now
miss
bunner
you
got
to
go
right
to
bed
this
very
oh
but
i
ca
ann
eliza
attempted
a
wan
smile
you
forget
there
ai
nobody
but
me
to
tend
the
i
guess
you
wo
tend
it
long
neither
if
you
ai
careful
hawkins
grimly
rejoined
beneath
her
placid
exterior
she
cherished
a
morbid
passion
for
disease
and
death
and
the
sight
of
ann
suffering
had
roused
her
from
her
habitual
indifference
there
so
many
folks
comes
to
the
store
anyhow
she
went
on
with
unconscious
cruelty
and
i
go
right
up
and
see
if
miss
mellins
ca
spare
one
of
her
ann
eliza
too
weary
to
resist
allowed
hawkins
to
put
her
to
bed
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
over
the
stove
while
miss
mellins
always
responsive
to
any
appeal
for
help
sent
down
the
little
girl
to
deal
with
hypothetical
customers
ann
eliza
having
so
far
abdicated
her
independence
sank
into
sudden
apathy
as
far
as
she
could
remember
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
been
taken
care
of
instead
of
taking
care
and
there
was
a
momentary
relief
in
the
surrender
she
swallowed
the
tea
like
an
obedient
child
allowed
a
poultice
to
be
applied
to
her
aching
chest
and
uttered
no
protest
when
a
fire
was
kindled
in
the
rarely
used
grate
but
as
hawkins
bent
over
to
settle
her
pillows
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
to
whisper
oh
hawkins
hochmuller
war
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
war
there
has
she
moved
over
two
months
ago
and
they
do
know
where
she
gone
oh
what
i
do
hawkins
there
there
miss
bunner
you
lay
still
and
do
fret
i
ask
hawkins
soon
as
ever
he
comes
ann
eliza
murmured
her
gratitude
and
hawkins
bending
down
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
do
you
fret
she
repeated
in
the
voice
with
which
she
soothed
her
children
for
over
a
week
ann
eliza
lay
in
bed
faithfully
nursed
by
her
two
neighbours
while
the
child
and
the
pale
sewing
girl
who
had
helped
to
finish
evelina
wedding
dress
took
turns
in
minding
the
shop
every
morning
when
her
friends
appeared
ann
eliza
lifted
her
head
to
ask
is
there
a
letter
and
at
their
gentle
negative
sank
back
in
silence
hawkins
for
several
days
spoke
no
more
of
her
promise
to
consult
her
husband
as
to
the
best
way
of
tracing
hochmuller
and
dread
of
fresh
disappointment
kept
ann
eliza
from
bringing
up
the
subject
but
the
following
sunday
evening
as
she
sat
for
the
first
time
bolstered
up
in
her
near
the
stove
while
miss
mellins
studied
the
police
gazette
beneath
the
lamp
there
came
a
knock
on
the
and
hawkins
entered
ann
eliza
first
glance
at
his
plain
friendly
face
showed
her
he
had
news
to
give
but
though
she
no
longer
attempted
to
hide
her
anxiety
from
miss
mellins
her
lips
trembled
too
much
to
let
her
speak
good
evening
miss
bunner
said
hawkins
in
his
dragging
voice
i
been
over
to
hoboken
all
day
looking
round
for
oh
hawkins
you
have
i
made
a
thorough
search
but
i
sorry
to
say
it
was
no
use
left
hoboken
moved
clear
away
and
nobody
seems
to
know
it
was
real
good
of
you
ann
eliza
voice
struggled
up
in
a
faint
whisper
through
the
submerging
tide
of
her
disappointment
hawkins
in
his
embarrassed
sense
of
being
the
bringer
of
bad
news
stood
before
her
uncertainly
then
he
turned
to
go
no
trouble
at
all
he
paused
to
assure
her
from
the
doorway
she
wanted
to
speak
again
to
detain
him
to
ask
him
to
advise
her
but
the
words
caught
in
her
throat
and
she
lay
back
silent
the
next
day
she
got
up
early
and
dressed
and
bonneted
herself
with
twitching
fingers
she
waited
till
the
child
appeared
and
having
laid
on
her
minute
instructions
as
to
the
care
of
the
shop
she
slipped
out
into
the
street
it
had
occurred
to
her
in
one
of
the
weary
watches
of
the
previous
night
that
she
might
go
to
tiffany
and
make
enquiries
about
ramy
past
possibly
in
that
way
she
might
obtain
some
information
that
would
suggest
a
new
way
of
reaching
evelina
she
was
guiltily
aware
that
hawkins
and
miss
mellins
would
be
angry
with
her
for
venturing
out
of
doors
but
she
knew
she
should
never
feel
any
better
till
she
had
news
of
evelina
the
morning
air
was
sharp
and
as
she
turned
to
face
the
wind
she
felt
so
weak
and
unsteady
that
she
wondered
if
she
should
ever
get
as
far
as
union
square
but
by
walking
very
slowly
and
standing
still
now
and
then
when
she
could
do
so
without
being
noticed
she
found
herself
at
last
before
the
jeweller
great
glass
doors
it
was
still
so
early
that
there
were
no
purchasers
in
the
shop
and
she
felt
herself
the
centre
of
innumerable
unemployed
eyes
as
she
moved
forward
between
long
lines
of
glittering
with
diamonds
and
silver
she
was
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
without
having
to
approach
one
of
the
impressive
gentlemen
who
paced
the
empty
aisles
when
she
attracted
the
attention
of
one
of
the
most
impressive
of
the
number
the
formidable
benevolence
with
which
he
enquired
what
he
could
do
for
her
made
her
almost
despair
of
explaining
herself
but
she
finally
disentangled
from
a
flurry
of
wrong
beginnings
the
request
to
be
shown
to
the
the
gentleman
considered
her
thoughtfully
may
i
ask
what
style
of
clock
you
are
looking
for
would
it
be
for
a
or
the
irony
of
the
allusion
filled
ann
eliza
veins
with
sudden
strength
i
do
want
to
buy
a
clock
at
all
i
want
to
see
the
head
of
the
mr
loomis
his
stare
still
weighed
her
then
he
seemed
to
brush
aside
the
problem
she
presented
as
beneath
his
notice
oh
certainly
take
the
elevator
to
the
second
floor
next
aisle
to
the
he
waved
her
down
the
endless
perspective
of
ann
eliza
followed
the
line
of
his
lordly
gesture
and
a
swift
ascent
brought
her
to
a
great
hall
full
of
the
buzzing
and
booming
of
thousands
of
clocks
whichever
way
she
looked
clocks
stretched
away
from
her
in
glittering
interminable
vistas
clocks
of
all
sizes
and
voices
from
the
giant
of
the
hallway
to
the
chirping
toy
tall
clocks
of
mahogany
and
brass
with
cathedral
chimes
clocks
of
bronze
glass
porcelain
of
every
possible
size
voice
and
configuration
and
between
their
serried
ranks
along
the
polished
floor
of
the
aisles
moved
the
languid
forms
of
other
gentlemanly
waiting
for
their
duties
to
begin
one
of
them
soon
approached
and
ann
eliza
repeated
her
request
he
received
it
affably
mr
loomis
go
right
down
to
the
office
at
the
other
he
pointed
to
a
kind
of
box
of
ground
glass
and
highly
polished
panelling
as
she
thanked
him
he
turned
to
one
of
his
companions
and
said
something
in
which
she
caught
the
name
of
loomis
and
which
was
received
with
an
appreciative
chuckle
she
suspected
herself
of
being
the
object
of
the
pleasantry
and
straightened
her
thin
shoulders
under
her
mantle
the
door
of
the
office
stood
open
and
within
sat
a
man
at
a
desk
he
looked
up
kindly
and
again
she
asked
for
loomis
i
loomis
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
was
much
less
portentous
than
the
others
though
she
guessed
him
to
be
above
them
in
authority
and
encouraged
by
his
tone
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
he
waved
her
to
i
hope
you
excuse
my
troubling
you
sir
i
came
to
ask
if
you
could
tell
me
anything
about
herman
ramy
he
was
employed
here
in
the
two
or
three
years
loomis
showed
no
recognition
of
the
name
ramy
when
was
he
discharged
i
do
know
he
was
very
sick
and
when
he
got
well
his
place
had
been
filled
he
married
my
sister
last
october
and
they
went
to
louis
i
ai
had
any
news
of
them
for
over
two
months
and
she
my
only
sister
and
i
most
crazy
worrying
about
i
loomis
reflected
in
what
capacity
was
ramy
employed
here
he
asked
after
a
moment
he
he
told
us
that
he
was
one
of
the
heads
of
the
ann
eliza
stammered
overswept
by
a
sudden
doubt
that
was
probably
a
slight
exaggeration
but
i
can
tell
you
about
him
by
referring
to
our
books
the
name
again
ramy
herman
there
ensued
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
the
flutter
of
leaves
as
loomis
turned
over
his
ledgers
presently
he
looked
up
keeping
his
finger
between
the
pages
here
it
is
herman
ramy
he
was
one
of
our
ordinary
workmen
and
left
us
three
years
and
a
half
ago
last
on
account
of
sickness
ann
eliza
faltered
loomis
appeared
to
hesitate
then
he
said
i
see
no
mention
of
ann
eliza
felt
his
compassionate
eyes
on
her
again
perhaps
i
better
tell
you
the
truth
he
was
discharged
for
a
capable
workman
but
we
could
keep
him
straight
i
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
this
but
it
seems
fairer
since
you
say
you
anxious
about
your
the
polished
sides
of
the
office
vanished
from
ann
eliza
sight
and
the
cackle
of
the
innumerable
clocks
came
to
her
like
the
yell
of
waves
in
a
storm
she
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
tried
to
get
to
her
feet
but
the
floor
was
gone
i
very
sorry
loomis
repeated
closing
the
ledger
i
remember
the
man
perfectly
now
he
used
to
disappear
every
now
and
then
and
turn
up
again
in
a
state
that
made
him
useless
for
as
she
listened
ann
eliza
recalled
the
day
when
she
had
come
on
ramy
sitting
in
abject
dejection
behind
his
counter
she
saw
again
the
blurred
unrecognizing
eyes
he
had
raised
to
her
the
layer
of
dust
over
everything
in
the
shop
and
the
green
bronze
clock
in
the
window
representing
a
newfoundland
dog
with
his
paw
on
a
book
she
stood
up
slowly
thank
you
i
sorry
to
have
troubled
it
was
no
trouble
you
say
ramy
married
your
sister
last
october
yes
sir
and
they
went
to
louis
right
afterward
i
do
know
how
to
find
her
i
thought
maybe
somebody
here
might
know
about
well
possibly
some
of
the
workmen
might
leave
me
your
name
and
send
you
word
if
i
get
on
his
he
handed
her
a
pencil
and
she
wrote
down
her
address
then
she
walked
away
blindly
between
the
clocks
xi
loomis
true
to
his
word
wrote
a
few
days
later
that
he
had
enquired
in
vain
in
the
for
any
news
of
ramy
and
as
she
folded
this
letter
and
laid
it
between
the
leaves
of
her
bible
ann
eliza
felt
that
her
last
hope
was
gone
miss
mellins
of
course
had
long
since
suggested
the
mediation
of
the
police
and
cited
from
her
favourite
literature
convincing
instances
of
the
supernatural
ability
of
the
pinkerton
detective
but
hawkins
when
called
in
council
dashed
this
project
by
remarking
that
detectives
cost
something
like
twenty
dollars
a
day
and
a
vague
fear
of
the
law
some
vision
of
evelina
in
the
clutch
of
a
officer
kept
ann
eliza
from
invoking
the
aid
of
the
police
after
the
arrival
of
loomis
note
the
weeks
followed
each
other
uneventfully
ann
eliza
cough
clung
to
her
till
late
in
the
spring
the
reflection
in
her
grew
more
bent
and
meagre
and
her
forehead
sloped
back
farther
toward
the
twist
of
hair
that
was
fastened
above
her
parting
by
a
comb
of
black
toward
spring
a
lady
who
was
expecting
a
baby
took
up
her
abode
at
the
mendoza
family
hotel
and
through
the
friendly
intervention
of
miss
mellins
the
making
of
some
of
the
was
entrusted
to
ann
eliza
this
eased
her
of
anxiety
for
the
immediate
future
but
she
had
to
rouse
herself
to
feel
any
sense
of
relief
her
personal
welfare
was
what
least
concerned
her
sometimes
she
thought
of
giving
up
the
shop
altogether
and
only
the
fear
that
if
she
changed
her
address
evelina
might
not
be
able
to
find
her
kept
her
from
carrying
out
this
plan
since
she
had
lost
her
last
hope
of
tracing
her
sister
all
the
activities
of
her
lonely
imagination
had
been
concentrated
on
the
possibility
of
evelina
coming
back
to
her
the
discovery
of
secret
filled
her
with
dreadful
fears
in
the
solitude
of
the
shop
and
the
back
room
she
was
tortured
by
vague
pictures
of
sufferings
what
horrors
might
not
be
hidden
beneath
her
silence
ann
eliza
great
dread
was
that
miss
mellins
should
worm
out
of
her
what
she
had
learned
from
loomis
she
was
sure
miss
mellins
must
have
abominable
things
to
tell
about
things
she
did
not
have
the
strength
to
hear
the
very
word
was
satanic
she
could
hear
miss
mellins
roll
it
on
her
tongue
but
ann
eliza
own
imagination
left
to
itself
had
begun
to
people
the
long
hours
with
evil
visions
sometimes
in
the
night
she
thought
she
heard
herself
called
the
voice
was
her
sister
but
faint
with
a
nameless
terror
her
most
peaceful
moments
were
those
in
which
she
managed
to
convince
herself
that
evelina
was
dead
she
thought
of
her
then
mournfully
but
more
calmly
as
thrust
away
under
the
neglected
mound
of
some
unknown
cemetery
where
no
headstone
marked
her
name
no
mourner
with
flowers
for
another
grave
paused
in
pity
to
lay
a
blossom
on
hers
but
this
vision
did
not
often
give
ann
eliza
its
negative
relief
and
always
beneath
its
hazy
lines
lurked
the
dark
conviction
that
evelina
was
alive
in
misery
and
longing
for
her
so
the
summer
wore
on
ann
eliza
was
conscious
that
hawkins
and
miss
mellins
were
watching
her
with
affectionate
anxiety
but
the
knowledge
brought
no
comfort
she
no
longer
cared
what
they
felt
or
thought
about
her
her
grief
lay
far
beyond
touch
of
human
healing
and
after
a
while
she
became
aware
that
they
knew
they
could
not
help
her
they
still
came
in
as
often
as
their
busy
lives
permitted
but
their
visits
grew
shorter
and
hawkins
always
brought
arthur
or
the
baby
so
that
there
should
be
something
to
talk
about
and
some
one
whom
she
could
scold
the
autumn
came
and
the
winter
business
had
fallen
off
again
and
but
few
purchasers
came
to
the
little
shop
in
the
basement
in
january
ann
eliza
pawned
her
mother
cashmere
scarf
her
mosaic
brooch
and
the
rosewood
on
which
the
clock
had
always
stood
she
would
have
sold
the
bedstead
too
but
for
the
persistent
vision
of
evelina
returning
weak
and
weary
and
not
knowing
where
to
lay
her
head
the
winter
passed
in
its
turn
and
march
reappeared
with
its
galaxies
of
yellow
jonquils
at
the
windy
street
corners
reminding
ann
eliza
of
the
spring
day
when
evelina
had
come
home
with
a
bunch
of
jonquils
in
her
hand
in
spite
of
the
flowers
which
lent
such
a
premature
brightness
to
the
streets
the
month
was
fierce
and
stormy
and
ann
eliza
could
get
no
warmth
into
her
bones
nevertheless
she
was
insensibly
beginning
to
take
up
the
healing
routine
of
life
little
by
little
she
had
grown
used
to
being
alone
she
had
begun
to
take
a
languid
interest
in
the
one
or
two
new
purchasers
the
season
had
brought
and
though
the
thought
of
evelina
was
as
poignant
as
ever
it
was
less
persistently
in
the
foreground
of
her
mind
late
one
afternoon
she
was
sitting
behind
the
counter
wrapped
in
her
shawl
and
wondering
how
soon
she
might
draw
down
the
blinds
and
retreat
into
the
comparative
cosiness
of
the
back
room
she
was
not
thinking
of
anything
in
particular
except
perhaps
in
a
hazy
way
of
the
lady
with
the
puffed
sleeves
who
after
her
long
eclipse
had
reappeared
the
day
before
in
sleeves
of
a
new
cut
and
bought
some
tape
and
needles
the
lady
still
wore
mourning
but
she
was
evidently
lightening
it
and
ann
eliza
saw
in
this
the
hope
of
future
orders
the
lady
had
left
the
shop
about
an
hour
before
walking
away
with
her
graceful
step
toward
fifth
avenue
she
had
wished
ann
eliza
good
day
in
her
usual
affable
way
and
ann
eliza
thought
how
odd
it
was
that
they
should
have
been
acquainted
so
long
and
yet
that
she
should
not
know
the
lady
name
from
this
consideration
her
mind
wandered
to
the
cut
of
the
lady
new
sleeves
and
she
was
vexed
with
herself
for
not
having
noted
it
more
carefully
she
felt
miss
mellins
might
have
liked
to
know
about
it
ann
powers
of
observation
had
never
been
as
keen
as
evelina
when
the
latter
was
not
too
to
exert
them
as
miss
mellins
always
said
evelina
could
take
patterns
with
her
eyes
she
could
have
cut
that
new
sleeve
out
of
a
folded
newspaper
in
a
trice
musing
on
these
things
ann
eliza
wished
the
lady
would
come
back
and
give
her
another
look
at
the
sleeve
it
was
not
unlikely
that
she
might
pass
that
way
for
she
certainly
lived
in
or
about
the
square
suddenly
ann
eliza
remarked
a
small
neat
handkerchief
on
the
counter
it
must
have
dropped
from
the
lady
purse
and
she
would
probably
come
back
to
get
it
ann
eliza
pleased
at
the
idea
sat
on
behind
the
counter
and
watched
the
darkening
street
she
always
lit
the
gas
as
late
as
possible
keeping
the
box
of
matches
at
her
elbow
so
that
if
any
one
came
she
could
apply
a
quick
flame
to
the
at
length
through
the
deepening
dusk
she
distinguished
a
slim
dark
figure
coming
down
the
steps
to
the
shop
with
a
little
warmth
of
pleasure
about
her
heart
she
reached
up
to
light
the
gas
i
do
believe
i
ask
her
name
this
time
she
thought
she
raised
the
flame
to
its
full
height
and
saw
her
sister
standing
in
the
door
there
she
was
at
last
the
poor
pale
shade
of
evelina
her
thin
face
blanched
of
its
faint
pink
the
stiff
ripples
gone
from
her
hair
and
a
mantle
shabbier
than
ann
eliza
drawn
about
her
narrow
shoulders
the
glare
of
the
gas
beat
full
on
her
as
she
stood
and
looked
at
ann
eliza
sister
oh
evelina
i
knowed
you
come
ann
eliza
had
caught
her
close
with
a
long
moan
of
triumph
vague
words
poured
from
her
as
she
laid
her
cheek
against
evelina
trivial
inarticulate
endearments
caught
from
hawkins
long
discourses
to
her
baby
for
a
while
evelina
let
herself
be
passively
held
then
she
drew
back
from
her
sister
clasp
and
looked
about
the
shop
i
dead
tired
ai
there
any
fire
she
asked
of
course
there
is
ann
eliza
holding
her
hand
fast
drew
her
into
the
back
room
she
did
not
want
to
ask
any
questions
yet
she
simply
wanted
to
feel
the
emptiness
of
the
room
brimmed
full
again
by
the
one
presence
that
was
warmth
and
light
to
her
she
knelt
down
before
the
grate
scraped
some
bits
of
coal
and
kindling
from
the
bottom
of
the
and
drew
one
of
the
up
to
the
weak
flame
there
that
blaze
up
in
a
minute
she
said
she
pressed
evelina
down
on
the
faded
cushions
of
the
and
kneeling
beside
her
began
to
rub
her
hands
you
ai
you
just
sit
still
and
warm
yourself
while
i
run
and
get
the
kettle
i
got
something
you
always
used
to
fancy
for
she
laid
her
hand
on
evelina
shoulder
do
talk
oh
talk
yet
she
implored
she
wanted
to
keep
that
one
frail
second
of
happiness
between
herself
and
what
she
knew
must
come
evelina
without
a
word
bent
over
the
fire
stretching
her
thin
hands
to
the
blaze
and
watching
ann
eliza
fill
the
kettle
and
set
the
supper
table
her
gaze
had
the
dreamy
fixity
of
a
child
ann
eliza
with
a
smile
of
triumph
brought
a
slice
of
custard
pie
from
the
cupboard
and
put
it
by
her
sister
plate
you
do
like
that
do
you
miss
mellins
sent
it
down
to
me
this
morning
she
had
her
aunt
from
brooklyn
to
dinner
ai
it
funny
it
just
so
happened
i
ai
hungry
said
evelina
rising
to
approach
the
table
she
sat
down
in
her
usual
place
looked
about
her
with
the
same
wondering
stare
and
then
as
of
old
poured
herself
out
the
first
cup
of
tea
where
the
gone
to
she
suddenly
asked
ann
eliza
set
down
the
teapot
and
rose
to
get
a
spoon
from
the
cupboard
with
her
back
to
the
room
she
said
the
why
you
see
dearie
living
here
all
alone
by
myself
it
only
made
one
more
thing
to
dust
so
i
sold
evelina
eyes
were
still
travelling
about
the
familiar
room
though
it
was
against
all
the
traditions
of
the
bunner
family
to
sell
any
household
possession
she
showed
no
surprise
at
her
sister
answer
and
the
clock
the
clock
gone
oh
i
gave
that
away
i
gave
it
to
hawkins
she
kep
awake
so
nights
with
that
last
i
wish
you
never
bought
it
said
evelina
harshly
ann
eliza
heart
grew
faint
with
fear
without
answering
she
crossed
over
to
her
sister
seat
and
poured
her
out
a
second
cup
of
tea
then
another
thought
struck
her
and
she
went
back
to
the
cupboard
and
took
out
the
cordial
in
evelina
absence
considerable
draughts
had
been
drawn
from
it
by
invalid
neighbours
but
a
glassful
of
the
precious
liquid
still
remained
here
drink
this
right
off
it
warm
you
up
quicker
than
anything
ann
eliza
said
evelina
obeyed
and
a
slight
spark
of
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
she
turned
to
the
custard
pie
and
began
to
eat
with
a
silent
voracity
distressing
to
watch
she
did
not
even
look
to
see
what
was
left
for
ann
eliza
i
ai
hungry
she
said
at
last
as
she
laid
down
her
fork
i
only
so
dead
tired
that
the
then
you
better
get
right
into
bed
here
my
old
plaid
you
remember
it
do
you
ann
eliza
laughed
recalling
evelina
ironies
on
the
subject
of
the
antiquated
garment
with
trembling
fingers
she
began
to
undo
her
sister
cloak
the
dress
beneath
it
told
a
tale
of
poverty
that
ann
eliza
dared
not
pause
to
note
she
drew
it
gently
off
and
as
it
slipped
from
evelina
shoulders
it
revealed
a
tiny
black
bag
hanging
on
a
ribbon
about
her
neck
evelina
lifted
her
hand
as
though
to
screen
the
bag
from
ann
eliza
and
the
elder
sister
seeing
the
gesture
continued
her
task
with
lowered
eyes
she
undressed
evelina
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
wrapping
her
in
the
plaid
put
her
to
bed
and
spread
her
own
shawl
and
her
sister
cloak
above
the
blanket
where
the
old
red
comfortable
evelina
asked
as
she
sank
down
on
the
pillow
the
comfortable
oh
it
was
so
hot
and
heavy
i
never
used
it
after
you
went
so
i
sold
that
too
i
never
could
sleep
under
much
she
became
aware
that
her
sister
was
looking
at
her
more
attentively
i
guess
you
been
in
trouble
too
evelina
said
me
in
trouble
what
do
you
mean
evelina
you
had
to
pawn
the
things
i
suppose
evelina
continued
in
a
weary
unmoved
tone
well
i
been
through
worse
than
that
i
been
to
hell
and
oh
evelina
do
say
it
sister
ann
eliza
implored
shrinking
from
the
unholy
word
she
knelt
down
and
began
to
rub
her
sister
feet
beneath
the
bedclothes
i
been
to
hell
and
back
if
i
am
back
evelina
repeated
she
lifted
her
head
from
the
pillow
and
began
to
talk
with
a
sudden
feverish
volubility
it
began
right
away
less
than
a
month
after
we
were
married
i
been
in
hell
all
that
time
ann
she
fixed
her
eyes
with
passionate
intentness
on
ann
eliza
face
he
took
opium
i
find
it
out
till
long
afterward
at
first
when
he
acted
so
strange
i
thought
he
drank
but
it
was
worse
much
worse
than
oh
sister
do
say
it
do
say
it
yet
it
so
sweet
just
to
have
you
here
with
me
i
must
say
it
evelina
insisted
her
flushed
face
burning
with
a
kind
of
bitter
cruelty
you
do
know
what
life
like
you
do
know
anything
about
it
setting
here
safe
all
the
while
in
this
peaceful
oh
evelina
why
did
you
write
and
send
for
me
if
it
was
like
that
that
why
i
could
write
did
you
guess
i
was
ashamed
how
could
you
be
ashamed
to
write
to
ann
eliza
evelina
raised
herself
on
her
thin
elbow
while
ann
eliza
bending
over
drew
a
corner
of
the
shawl
about
her
shoulder
do
lay
down
again
you
catch
your
my
death
that
do
frighten
me
you
do
know
what
i
been
and
sitting
upright
in
the
old
mahogany
bed
with
flushed
cheeks
and
chattering
teeth
and
ann
eliza
trembling
arm
clasping
the
shawl
about
her
neck
evelina
poured
out
her
story
it
was
a
tale
of
misery
and
humiliation
so
remote
from
the
elder
sister
innocent
experiences
that
much
of
it
was
hardly
intelligible
to
her
dreadful
familiarity
with
it
all
her
fluency
about
things
which
ann
eliza
and
quickly
shuddered
back
from
seemed
even
more
alien
and
terrible
than
the
actual
tale
she
told
it
was
one
thing
and
heaven
knew
it
was
bad
enough
to
learn
that
one
sister
husband
was
a
it
was
another
and
much
worse
thing
to
learn
from
that
sister
pallid
lips
what
vileness
lay
behind
the
word
evelina
unconscious
of
any
distress
but
her
own
sat
upright
shivering
in
ann
eliza
hold
while
she
piled
up
detail
by
detail
her
dreary
narrative
the
minute
we
got
out
there
and
he
found
the
job
was
as
good
as
he
expected
he
changed
at
first
i
thought
he
was
sick
i
used
to
try
to
keep
him
home
and
nurse
him
then
i
saw
it
was
something
different
he
used
to
go
off
for
hours
at
a
time
and
when
he
came
back
his
eyes
kinder
had
a
fog
over
them
sometimes
he
did
know
me
and
when
he
did
he
seemed
to
hate
me
once
he
hit
me
she
touched
her
breast
do
you
remember
ann
eliza
that
time
he
did
come
to
see
us
for
a
week
the
time
after
we
all
went
to
central
park
together
and
you
and
i
thought
he
must
be
sick
ann
eliza
nodded
well
that
was
the
trouble
he
been
at
it
then
but
nothing
like
as
bad
after
we
been
out
there
about
a
month
he
disappeared
for
a
whole
week
they
took
him
back
at
the
store
and
gave
him
another
chance
but
the
second
time
they
discharged
him
and
he
drifted
round
for
ever
so
long
before
he
could
get
another
job
we
spent
all
our
money
and
had
to
move
to
a
cheaper
place
then
he
got
something
to
do
but
they
hardly
paid
him
anything
and
he
did
stay
there
long
when
he
found
out
about
the
baby
the
baby
ann
eliza
faltered
it
dead
it
only
lived
a
day
when
he
found
out
about
it
he
got
mad
and
said
he
had
any
money
to
pay
doctors
bills
and
i
better
write
to
you
to
help
us
he
had
an
idea
you
had
money
hidden
away
that
i
did
know
she
turned
to
her
sister
with
remorseful
eyes
it
was
him
that
made
me
get
that
hundred
dollars
out
of
hush
hush
i
always
meant
it
for
you
yes
but
i
would
have
taken
it
if
he
had
been
at
me
the
whole
time
he
used
to
make
me
do
just
what
he
wanted
well
when
i
said
i
would
write
to
you
for
more
money
he
said
i
better
try
and
earn
some
myself
that
was
when
he
struck
me
oh
you
do
know
what
talking
about
yet
i
tried
to
get
work
at
a
milliner
but
i
was
so
sick
i
could
stay
i
was
sick
all
the
time
i
wisht
i
ha
died
ann
no
no
yes
i
do
it
kept
getting
worse
and
worse
we
pawned
the
furniture
and
they
turned
us
out
because
we
could
pay
the
rent
and
so
then
we
went
to
board
with
ann
eliza
pressed
her
closer
to
dissemble
her
own
tremor
mrs
hochmuller
did
you
know
she
was
out
there
she
moved
out
a
month
after
we
did
she
was
bad
to
me
and
i
think
she
tried
to
keep
him
straight
but
linda
linda
well
when
i
kep
getting
worse
and
he
was
always
off
for
days
at
a
time
the
doctor
had
me
sent
to
a
a
hospital
sister
sister
it
was
better
than
being
with
him
and
the
doctors
were
real
kind
to
me
after
the
baby
was
born
i
was
very
sick
and
had
to
stay
there
a
good
while
and
one
day
when
i
was
laying
there
hochmuller
came
in
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
told
me
him
and
linda
had
gone
off
together
and
taken
all
her
money
that
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
she
broke
off
with
a
laugh
and
began
to
cough
again
ann
eliza
tried
to
persuade
her
to
lie
down
and
sleep
but
the
rest
of
her
story
had
to
be
told
before
she
could
be
soothed
into
consent
after
the
news
of
ramy
flight
she
had
had
brain
fever
and
had
been
sent
to
another
hospital
where
she
stayed
a
long
time
how
long
she
remember
dates
and
days
meant
nothing
to
her
in
the
shapeless
ruin
of
her
life
when
she
left
the
hospital
she
found
that
hochmuller
had
gone
too
she
was
penniless
and
had
no
one
to
turn
to
a
lady
visitor
at
the
hospital
was
kind
and
found
her
a
place
where
she
did
housework
but
she
was
so
weak
they
could
keep
her
then
she
got
a
job
as
waitress
in
a
but
one
day
she
fainted
while
she
was
handing
a
dish
and
that
evening
when
they
paid
her
they
told
her
she
need
come
again
after
that
i
begged
in
the
streets
ann
eliza
grasp
again
grew
tight
and
one
afternoon
last
week
when
the
matinees
was
coming
out
i
met
a
man
with
a
pleasant
face
something
like
hawkins
and
he
stopped
and
asked
me
what
the
trouble
was
i
told
him
if
he
give
me
five
dollars
i
have
money
enough
to
buy
a
ticket
back
to
new
york
and
he
took
a
good
look
at
me
and
said
well
if
that
was
what
i
wanted
go
straight
to
the
station
with
me
and
give
me
the
five
dollars
there
so
he
did
and
he
bought
the
ticket
and
put
me
in
the
evelina
sank
back
her
face
a
sallow
wedge
in
the
white
cleft
of
the
pillow
ann
eliza
leaned
over
her
and
for
a
long
time
they
held
each
other
without
speaking
they
were
still
clasped
in
this
dumb
embrace
when
there
was
a
step
in
the
shop
and
ann
eliza
starting
up
saw
miss
mellins
in
the
doorway
my
sakes
miss
bunner
what
in
the
land
are
you
doing
miss
evelina
ramy
it
ai
you
miss
mellins
eyes
bursting
from
their
sockets
sprang
from
pallid
face
to
the
disordered
supper
table
and
the
heap
of
worn
clothes
on
the
floor
then
they
turned
back
to
ann
eliza
who
had
placed
herself
on
the
defensive
between
her
sister
and
the
my
sister
evelina
has
come
back
come
back
on
a
visit
she
was
taken
sick
in
the
cars
on
the
way
home
i
guess
she
caught
cold
so
i
made
her
go
right
to
bed
as
soon
as
ever
she
got
ann
eliza
was
surprised
at
the
strength
and
steadiness
of
her
voice
fortified
by
its
sound
she
went
on
her
eyes
on
miss
mellins
baffled
countenance
mr
ramy
has
gone
west
on
a
trip
a
trip
connected
with
his
business
and
evelina
is
going
to
stay
with
me
till
he
comes
xii
what
measure
of
belief
her
explanation
of
evelina
return
obtained
in
the
small
circle
of
her
friends
ann
eliza
did
not
pause
to
enquire
though
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
told
a
lie
before
she
adhered
with
rigid
tenacity
to
the
consequences
of
her
first
lapse
from
truth
and
fortified
her
original
statement
with
additional
details
whenever
a
questioner
sought
to
take
her
unawares
but
other
and
more
serious
burdens
lay
on
her
startled
conscience
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
dimly
faced
the
awful
problem
of
the
inutility
of
hitherto
she
had
never
thought
of
questioning
the
inherited
principles
which
had
guided
her
life
for
the
good
of
others
had
always
seemed
to
her
both
natural
and
necessary
but
then
she
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
it
implied
the
securing
of
that
good
now
she
perceived
that
to
refuse
the
gifts
of
life
does
not
ensure
their
transmission
to
those
for
whom
they
have
been
surrendered
and
her
familiar
heaven
was
unpeopled
she
felt
she
could
no
longer
trust
in
the
goodness
of
god
and
there
was
only
a
black
abyss
above
the
roof
of
bunner
sisters
but
there
was
little
time
to
brood
upon
such
problems
the
care
of
evelina
filled
ann
eliza
days
and
nights
the
hastily
summoned
doctor
had
pronounced
her
to
be
suffering
from
pneumonia
and
under
his
care
the
first
stress
of
the
disease
was
relieved
but
her
recovery
was
only
partial
and
long
after
the
doctor
visits
had
ceased
she
continued
to
lie
in
bed
too
weak
to
move
and
seemingly
indifferent
to
everything
about
her
at
length
one
evening
about
six
weeks
after
her
return
she
said
to
her
sister
i
do
feel
if
i
ever
get
up
ann
eliza
turned
from
the
kettle
she
was
placing
on
the
stove
she
was
startled
by
the
echo
the
words
woke
in
her
own
breast
do
you
talk
like
that
evelina
i
guess
you
tired
out
and
yes
i
disheartened
evelina
murmured
a
few
months
earlier
ann
eliza
would
have
met
the
confession
with
a
word
of
pious
admonition
now
she
accepted
it
in
silence
maybe
you
brighten
up
when
your
cough
gets
better
she
suggested
yes
or
my
cough
get
better
when
i
brighten
up
evelina
retorted
with
a
touch
of
her
old
tartness
does
your
cough
keep
on
hurting
you
jest
as
much
i
do
see
there
much
well
i
guess
i
get
the
doctor
to
come
round
again
ann
eliza
said
trying
for
the
tone
in
which
one
might
speak
of
sending
for
the
plumber
or
the
it
ai
any
use
sending
for
the
doctor
and
who
going
to
pay
him
i
am
answered
the
elder
sister
here
your
tea
and
a
mite
of
toast
do
that
tempt
you
already
in
the
watches
of
the
night
ann
eliza
had
been
tormented
by
that
same
question
who
was
to
pay
the
doctor
and
a
few
days
before
she
had
temporarily
silenced
it
by
borrowing
twenty
dollars
of
miss
mellins
the
transaction
had
cost
her
one
of
the
bitterest
struggles
of
her
life
she
had
never
borrowed
a
penny
of
any
one
before
and
the
possibility
of
having
to
do
so
had
always
been
classed
in
her
mind
among
those
shameful
extremities
to
which
providence
does
not
let
decent
people
come
but
nowadays
she
no
longer
believed
in
the
personal
supervision
of
providence
and
had
she
been
compelled
to
steal
the
money
instead
of
borrowing
it
she
would
have
felt
that
her
conscience
was
the
only
tribunal
before
which
she
had
to
answer
nevertheless
the
actual
humiliation
of
having
to
ask
for
the
money
was
no
less
bitter
and
she
could
hardly
hope
that
miss
mellins
would
view
the
case
with
the
same
detachment
as
herself
miss
mellins
was
very
kind
but
she
not
unnaturally
felt
that
her
kindness
should
be
rewarded
by
according
her
the
right
to
ask
questions
and
bit
by
bit
ann
eliza
saw
miserable
secret
slipping
into
the
possession
when
the
doctor
came
she
left
him
alone
with
evelina
busying
herself
in
the
shop
that
she
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
alone
on
his
way
out
to
steady
herself
she
began
to
sort
a
trayful
of
buttons
and
when
the
doctor
appeared
she
was
reciting
under
her
breath
horn
two
and
a
half
cards
fancy
pearl
she
saw
at
once
that
his
look
was
grave
he
sat
down
on
the
chair
beside
the
counter
and
her
mind
travelled
miles
before
he
spoke
miss
bunner
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
let
me
get
a
bed
for
your
sister
at
the
hospital
come
now
you
above
that
sort
of
prejudice
are
you
the
doctor
spoke
in
the
tone
of
one
who
coaxes
a
spoiled
child
i
know
how
devoted
you
are
but
ramy
can
be
much
better
cared
for
there
than
here
you
really
have
time
to
look
after
her
and
attend
to
your
business
as
well
there
be
no
expense
you
understand
ann
eliza
made
no
answer
you
think
my
sister
going
to
be
sick
a
good
while
then
she
asked
well
yes
you
think
she
very
sick
well
yes
she
very
his
face
had
grown
still
graver
he
sat
there
as
though
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
hurry
ann
eliza
continued
to
separate
the
pearl
and
horn
buttons
suddenly
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
is
she
going
to
die
the
doctor
laid
a
kindly
hand
on
hers
we
never
say
that
miss
bunner
human
skill
works
wonders
and
at
the
hospital
ramy
would
have
every
what
is
it
what
she
dying
of
the
doctor
hesitated
seeking
to
substitute
a
popular
phrase
for
the
scientific
terminology
which
rose
to
his
lips
i
want
to
know
ann
eliza
persisted
yes
of
course
i
understand
well
your
sister
has
had
a
hard
time
lately
and
there
is
a
complication
of
causes
resulting
in
consumption
rapid
consumption
at
the
hospital
i
keep
her
here
said
ann
eliza
quietly
after
the
doctor
had
gone
she
went
on
for
some
time
sorting
the
buttons
then
she
slipped
the
tray
into
its
place
on
a
shelf
behind
the
counter
and
went
into
the
back
room
she
found
evelina
propped
upright
against
the
pillows
a
flush
of
agitation
on
her
cheeks
ann
eliza
pulled
up
the
shawl
which
had
slipped
from
her
sister
shoulders
how
long
you
been
what
he
been
saying
oh
he
went
long
ago
he
stopped
to
give
me
a
prescription
i
was
sorting
out
that
tray
of
buttons
miss
mellins
girl
got
them
all
mixed
she
felt
evelina
eyes
upon
her
he
must
have
said
something
what
was
it
why
he
said
you
have
to
be
careful
and
stay
in
bed
and
take
this
new
medicine
he
given
did
he
say
i
was
going
to
get
well
why
evelina
what
the
use
ann
eliza
you
ca
deceive
me
i
just
been
up
to
look
at
myself
in
the
glass
and
i
saw
plenty
of
in
the
hospital
that
looked
like
me
they
did
get
well
and
i
ai
going
her
head
dropped
back
it
do
much
matter
i
about
tired
one
thing
ann
eliza
the
elder
sister
drew
near
to
the
bed
there
one
thing
i
ai
told
you
i
did
want
to
tell
you
yet
because
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
sorry
but
if
he
says
i
going
to
die
i
got
to
say
she
stopped
to
cough
and
to
ann
eliza
it
now
seemed
as
though
every
cough
struck
a
minute
from
the
hours
remaining
to
her
do
talk
now
you
i
be
tireder
i
guess
and
i
want
you
should
know
sit
down
close
to
me
ann
eliza
sat
down
in
silence
stroking
her
shrunken
hand
i
a
roman
catholic
ann
evelina
oh
evelina
bunner
a
roman
catholic
you
oh
evelina
did
he
make
you
evelina
shook
her
head
i
guess
he
did
have
no
religion
he
never
spoke
of
it
but
you
see
hochmuller
was
a
catholic
and
so
when
i
was
sick
she
got
the
doctor
to
send
me
to
a
roman
catholic
hospital
and
the
sisters
was
so
good
to
me
there
and
the
priest
used
to
come
and
talk
to
me
and
the
things
he
said
kep
me
from
going
crazy
he
seemed
to
make
everything
oh
sister
how
could
you
ann
eliza
wailed
she
knew
little
of
the
catholic
religion
except
that
papists
believed
in
it
in
itself
a
sufficient
indictment
her
spiritual
rebellion
had
not
freed
her
from
the
formal
part
of
her
religious
belief
and
apostasy
had
always
seemed
to
her
one
of
the
sins
from
which
the
pure
in
mind
avert
their
thoughts
and
then
when
the
baby
was
born
evelina
continued
he
christened
it
right
away
so
it
could
go
to
heaven
and
after
that
you
see
i
had
to
be
a
i
do
see
do
i
have
to
be
where
the
baby
is
i
could
ever
ha
gone
there
if
i
had
been
made
a
catholic
do
you
understand
that
ann
eliza
sat
speechless
drawing
her
hand
away
once
more
she
found
herself
shut
out
of
evelina
heart
an
exile
from
her
closest
affections
i
got
to
go
where
the
baby
is
evelina
feverishly
insisted
ann
eliza
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
she
could
only
feel
that
evelina
was
dying
and
dying
as
a
stranger
in
her
arms
ramy
and
the
baby
had
parted
her
forever
from
her
sister
evelina
began
again
if
i
get
worse
i
want
you
to
send
for
a
priest
miss
mellins
know
where
to
send
she
got
an
aunt
that
a
catholic
promise
me
faithful
you
i
promise
said
ann
eliza
after
that
they
spoke
no
more
of
the
matter
but
ann
eliza
now
understood
that
the
little
black
bag
about
her
sister
neck
which
she
had
innocently
taken
for
a
memento
of
ramy
was
some
kind
of
sacrilegious
amulet
and
her
fingers
shrank
from
its
contact
when
she
bathed
and
dressed
evelina
it
seemed
to
her
the
diabolical
instrument
of
their
estrangement
xiii
spring
had
really
come
at
last
there
were
leaves
on
the
that
evelina
could
see
from
her
bed
gentle
clouds
floated
over
it
in
the
blue
and
now
and
then
the
cry
of
a
sounded
from
the
street
one
day
there
was
a
shy
knock
on
the
door
and
johnny
hawkins
came
in
with
two
yellow
jonquils
in
his
fist
he
was
getting
bigger
and
squarer
and
his
round
freckled
face
was
growing
into
a
smaller
copy
of
his
father
he
walked
up
to
evelina
and
held
out
the
flowers
they
blew
off
the
cart
and
the
fellow
said
i
could
keep
but
you
can
have
he
announced
ann
eliza
rose
from
her
seat
at
the
and
tried
to
take
the
flowers
from
him
they
ai
for
you
they
for
her
he
sturdily
objected
and
evelina
held
out
her
hand
for
the
jonquils
after
johnny
had
gone
she
lay
and
looked
at
them
without
speaking
ann
eliza
who
had
gone
back
to
the
machine
bent
her
head
over
the
seam
she
was
stitching
the
click
click
click
of
the
machine
sounded
in
her
ear
like
the
tick
of
ramy
clock
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
life
had
gone
backward
and
that
evelina
radiant
and
foolish
had
just
come
into
the
room
with
the
yellow
flowers
in
her
hand
when
at
last
she
ventured
to
look
up
she
saw
that
her
sister
head
had
drooped
against
the
pillow
and
that
she
was
sleeping
quietly
her
relaxed
hand
still
held
the
jonquils
but
it
was
evident
that
they
had
awakened
no
memories
she
had
dozed
off
almost
as
soon
as
johnny
had
given
them
to
her
the
discovery
gave
ann
eliza
a
startled
sense
of
the
ruins
that
must
be
piled
upon
her
past
i
do
believe
i
could
have
forgotten
that
day
though
she
said
to
herself
but
she
was
glad
that
evelina
had
forgotten
evelina
disease
moved
on
along
the
usual
course
now
lifting
her
on
a
brief
wave
of
elation
now
sinking
her
to
new
depths
of
weakness
there
was
little
to
be
done
and
the
doctor
came
only
at
lengthening
intervals
on
his
way
out
he
always
repeated
his
first
friendly
suggestion
about
sending
evelina
to
the
hospital
and
ann
eliza
always
answered
i
guess
we
can
the
hours
passed
for
her
with
the
fierce
rapidity
that
great
joy
or
anguish
lends
them
she
went
through
the
days
with
a
sternly
smiling
precision
but
she
hardly
knew
what
was
happening
and
when
released
her
from
the
shop
and
she
could
carry
her
work
to
bedside
the
same
sense
of
unreality
accompanied
her
and
she
still
seemed
to
be
accomplishing
a
task
whose
object
had
escaped
her
memory
once
when
evelina
felt
better
she
expressed
a
desire
to
make
some
artificial
flowers
and
ann
eliza
deluded
by
this
awakening
interest
got
out
the
faded
bundles
of
stems
and
petals
and
the
little
tools
and
spools
of
wire
but
after
a
few
minutes
the
work
dropped
from
hands
and
she
said
i
wait
until
she
never
again
spoke
of
the
but
one
day
after
watching
ann
eliza
laboured
attempt
to
trim
a
spring
hat
for
hawkins
she
demanded
impatiently
that
the
hat
should
be
brought
to
her
and
in
a
trice
had
galvanized
the
lifeless
bow
and
given
the
brim
the
twist
it
needed
these
were
rare
gleams
and
more
frequent
were
the
days
of
speechless
lassitude
when
she
lay
for
hours
silently
staring
at
the
window
shaken
only
by
the
hard
incessant
cough
that
sounded
to
ann
eliza
like
the
hammering
of
nails
into
a
coffin
at
length
one
morning
ann
eliza
starting
up
from
the
mattress
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
hastily
called
miss
mellins
down
and
ran
through
the
smoky
dawn
for
the
doctor
he
came
back
with
her
and
did
what
he
could
to
give
evelina
momentary
relief
then
he
went
away
promising
to
look
in
again
before
night
miss
mellins
her
head
still
covered
with
disappeared
in
his
wake
and
when
the
sisters
were
alone
evelina
beckoned
to
ann
eliza
you
promised
she
whispered
grasping
her
sister
arm
and
ann
eliza
understood
she
had
not
yet
dared
to
tell
miss
mellins
of
change
of
faith
it
had
seemed
even
more
difficult
than
borrowing
the
money
but
now
it
had
to
be
done
she
ran
upstairs
after
the
and
detained
her
on
the
landing
miss
mellins
can
you
tell
me
where
to
send
for
a
priest
a
roman
catholic
priest
a
priest
miss
bunner
yes
my
sister
became
a
roman
catholic
while
she
was
away
they
were
kind
to
her
in
her
sickness
and
now
she
wants
a
ann
eliza
faced
miss
mellins
with
unflinching
eyes
my
aunt
dugan
know
i
run
right
round
to
her
the
minute
i
get
my
papers
off
the
promised
and
ann
eliza
thanked
her
an
hour
or
two
later
the
priest
appeared
ann
eliza
who
was
watching
saw
him
coming
down
the
steps
to
the
and
went
to
meet
him
his
expression
was
kind
but
she
shrank
from
his
peculiar
dress
and
from
his
pale
face
with
its
bluish
chin
and
enigmatic
smile
ann
eliza
remained
in
the
shop
miss
mellins
girl
had
mixed
the
buttons
again
and
she
set
herself
to
sort
them
the
priest
stayed
a
long
time
with
evelina
when
he
again
carried
his
enigmatic
smile
past
the
counter
and
ann
eliza
rejoined
her
sister
evelina
was
smiling
with
something
of
the
same
mystery
but
she
did
not
tell
her
secret
after
that
it
seemed
to
ann
eliza
that
the
shop
and
the
back
room
no
longer
belonged
to
her
it
was
as
though
she
were
there
on
sufferance
indulgently
tolerated
by
the
unseen
power
which
hovered
over
evelina
even
in
the
absence
of
its
minister
the
priest
came
almost
daily
and
at
last
a
day
arrived
when
he
was
called
to
administer
some
rite
of
which
ann
eliza
but
dimly
grasped
the
sacramental
meaning
all
she
knew
was
that
it
meant
that
evelina
was
going
and
going
under
this
alien
guidance
even
farther
from
her
than
to
the
dark
places
of
death
when
the
priest
came
with
something
covered
in
his
hands
she
crept
into
the
shop
closing
the
door
of
the
back
room
to
leave
him
alone
with
evelina
it
was
a
warm
afternoon
in
may
and
the
crooked
rooted
in
a
fissure
of
the
opposite
pavement
was
a
fountain
of
tender
green
women
in
light
dresses
passed
with
the
languid
step
of
spring
and
presently
there
came
a
man
with
a
full
of
pansy
and
geranium
plants
who
stopped
outside
the
window
signalling
to
ann
eliza
to
buy
an
hour
went
by
before
the
door
of
the
back
room
opened
and
the
priest
reappeared
with
that
mysterious
covered
something
in
his
hands
ann
eliza
had
risen
drawing
back
as
he
passed
he
had
doubtless
divined
her
antipathy
for
he
had
hitherto
only
bowed
in
going
in
and
out
but
to
day
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
compassionately
i
have
left
your
sister
in
a
very
beautiful
state
of
mind
he
said
in
a
low
voice
like
a
woman
she
is
full
of
spiritual
ann
eliza
was
silent
and
he
bowed
and
went
out
she
hastened
back
to
evelina
bed
and
knelt
down
beside
it
evelina
eyes
were
very
large
and
bright
she
turned
them
on
ann
eliza
with
a
look
of
inner
illumination
i
shall
see
the
baby
she
said
then
her
eyelids
fell
and
she
dozed
the
doctor
came
again
at
nightfall
administering
some
last
palliatives
and
after
he
had
gone
ann
eliza
refusing
to
have
her
vigil
shared
by
miss
mellins
or
hawkins
sat
down
to
keep
watch
alone
it
was
a
very
quiet
night
evelina
never
spoke
or
opened
her
eyes
but
in
the
still
hour
before
dawn
ann
eliza
saw
that
the
restless
hand
outside
the
had
stopped
its
twitching
she
stooped
over
and
felt
no
breath
on
her
sister
lips
the
funeral
took
place
three
days
later
evelina
was
buried
in
calvary
cemetery
the
priest
assuming
the
whole
care
of
the
necessary
arrangements
while
ann
eliza
a
passive
spectator
beheld
with
stony
indifference
this
last
negation
of
her
past
a
week
afterward
she
stood
in
her
bonnet
and
mantle
in
the
doorway
of
the
little
shop
its
whole
aspect
had
changed
counter
and
shelves
were
bare
the
window
was
stripped
of
its
familiar
miscellany
of
artificial
flowers
wire
and
limp
garments
from
the
dyer
and
against
the
glass
pane
of
the
doorway
hung
a
sign
this
store
to
ann
eliza
turned
her
eyes
from
the
sign
as
she
went
out
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
evelina
funeral
had
been
very
expensive
and
ann
eliza
having
sold
her
and
the
few
articles
of
furniture
that
remained
to
her
was
leaving
the
shop
for
the
last
time
she
had
not
been
able
to
buy
any
mourning
but
miss
mellins
had
sewed
some
crape
on
her
old
black
mantle
and
bonnet
and
having
no
gloves
she
slipped
her
bare
hands
under
the
folds
of
the
mantle
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
and
the
air
was
full
of
a
warm
sunshine
that
had
coaxed
open
nearly
every
window
in
the
street
and
summoned
to
the
the
sickly
plants
nurtured
indoors
in
winter
ann
way
lay
westward
toward
broadway
but
at
the
corner
she
paused
and
looked
back
down
the
familiar
length
of
the
street
her
eyes
rested
a
moment
on
the
blotched
bunner
sisters
above
the
empty
window
of
the
shop
then
they
travelled
on
to
the
overflowing
foliage
of
the
square
above
which
was
the
church
tower
with
the
dial
that
had
marked
the
hours
for
the
sisters
before
ann
eliza
had
bought
the
nickel
clock
she
looked
at
it
all
as
though
it
had
been
the
scene
of
some
unknown
life
of
which
the
vague
report
had
reached
her
she
felt
for
herself
the
only
remote
pity
that
busy
people
accord
to
the
misfortunes
which
come
to
them
by
hearsay
she
walked
to
broadway
and
down
to
the
office
of
the
to
whom
she
had
entrusted
the
of
the
shop
she
left
the
key
with
one
of
his
clerks
who
took
it
from
her
as
if
it
had
been
any
one
of
a
thousand
others
and
remarked
that
the
weather
looked
as
if
spring
was
really
coming
then
she
turned
and
began
to
move
up
the
great
thoroughfare
which
was
just
beginning
to
wake
to
its
multitudinous
activities
she
walked
less
rapidly
now
studying
each
shop
window
as
she
passed
but
not
with
the
desultory
eye
of
enjoyment
the
watchful
fixity
of
her
gaze
overlooked
everything
but
the
object
of
its
quest
at
length
she
stopped
before
a
small
window
wedged
between
two
mammoth
buildings
and
displaying
behind
its
shining
festooned
with
muslin
a
varied
assortment
of
painted
calendars
and
other
specimens
of
feminine
industry
in
a
corner
of
the
window
she
had
read
on
a
slip
of
paper
pasted
against
the
pane
wanted
a
saleslady
and
after
studying
the
display
of
fancy
articles
beneath
it
she
gave
her
mantle
a
twitch
straightened
her
shoulders
and
went
in
behind
a
counter
crowded
with
and
other
needlework
trifles
a
plump
young
woman
with
smooth
hair
sat
sewing
bows
of
ribbon
on
a
scrap
basket
the
little
shop
was
about
the
size
of
the
one
on
which
ann
eliza
had
just
closed
the
door
and
it
looked
as
fresh
and
gay
and
thriving
as
she
and
evelina
had
once
dreamed
of
making
bunner
sisters
the
friendly
air
of
the
place
made
her
pluck
up
courage
to
speak
saleslady
yes
we
do
want
one
have
you
any
one
to
recommend
the
young
woman
asked
not
unkindly
ann
eliza
hesitated
disconcerted
by
the
unexpected
question
and
the
other
cocking
her
head
on
one
side
to
study
the
effect
of
the
bow
she
had
just
sewed
on
the
basket
continued
we
ca
afford
more
than
thirty
dollars
a
month
but
the
work
is
light
she
would
be
expected
to
do
a
little
fancy
sewing
between
times
we
want
a
bright
girl
stylish
and
pleasant
manners
you
know
what
i
mean
not
over
thirty
anyhow
and
will
you
write
down
the
name
ann
eliza
looked
at
her
confusedly
she
opened
her
lips
to
explain
and
then
without
speaking
turned
toward
the
door
ai
you
going
to
leave
the
the
young
woman
called
out
after
her
ann
eliza
went
out
into
the
thronged
street
the
great
city
under
the
fair
spring
sky
seemed
to
throb
with
the
stir
of
innumerable
beginnings
she
walked
on
looking
for
another
shop
window
with
a
sign
in
it
the
end
