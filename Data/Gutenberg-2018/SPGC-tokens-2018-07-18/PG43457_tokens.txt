the
popular
story
of
blue
beard
a
long
time
ago
and
at
a
considerable
distance
from
any
town
there
lived
a
gentleman
who
was
not
only
in
possession
of
great
riches
but
of
the
largest
estates
in
that
part
of
the
country
although
he
had
some
very
elegant
neat
mansions
on
his
estates
he
generally
resided
in
a
magnificent
castle
beautifully
situated
on
a
rising
ground
surrounded
with
groves
of
the
finest
evergreens
and
other
choice
trees
and
shrubs
the
inside
of
this
fine
castle
was
even
more
beautiful
than
the
outside
for
the
rooms
were
all
hung
with
the
richest
damask
curiously
ornamented
the
chairs
and
sofas
were
covered
with
the
finest
velvet
fringed
with
gold
and
his
and
plates
were
either
of
silver
or
gold
finished
in
the
most
elegant
style
his
carriages
and
horses
might
have
served
a
king
and
perhaps
were
finer
than
any
monarch
of
the
present
day
the
gentleman
appearance
however
did
not
altogether
correspond
to
his
wealth
for
to
a
fierce
disagreeable
countenance
was
added
an
ugly
blue
beard
which
made
him
an
object
of
fear
and
disgust
in
the
neighbourhood
where
he
usually
went
by
the
name
of
blue
beard
there
resided
at
some
considerable
distance
from
blue
beard
castle
an
old
lady
and
her
two
daughters
who
were
people
of
some
rank
but
by
no
means
wealthy
the
two
young
ladies
were
very
pretty
and
the
fame
of
their
beauty
having
reached
blue
beard
he
determined
to
ask
one
of
them
in
marriage
having
ordered
a
carriage
he
called
at
their
house
where
he
saw
the
two
young
ladies
and
was
very
politely
received
by
their
mother
with
whom
he
begged
a
few
moments
conversation
illustration
after
the
two
young
ladies
left
the
room
he
began
by
describing
his
immense
riches
and
then
told
her
the
purport
of
his
visit
begging
she
would
use
her
interest
in
his
favour
they
were
both
so
lovely
he
said
that
he
would
be
happy
to
get
either
of
them
for
his
wife
and
would
therefore
leave
it
to
their
own
choice
to
determine
upon
the
subject
and
immediately
took
his
leave
when
the
proposals
of
blue
beard
were
mentioned
to
the
young
ladies
by
their
mother
both
miss
anne
and
her
sister
fatima
protested
that
they
would
never
marry
an
ugly
man
and
particularly
one
with
such
a
frightful
blue
beard
because
although
he
possessed
immense
riches
it
was
reported
in
the
country
that
he
had
married
several
beautiful
ladies
and
nobody
could
tell
what
had
become
of
them
their
mother
said
that
the
gentleman
was
agreeable
in
his
conversation
and
manners
that
the
ugliness
of
his
face
and
the
blue
beard
were
defects
which
they
would
soon
be
reconciled
to
from
habit
that
his
immense
riches
would
procure
them
every
luxury
their
heart
could
desire
and
he
was
so
civil
that
she
was
certain
the
scandalous
reports
about
his
wives
must
be
entirely
without
foundation
the
two
young
ladies
were
as
civil
as
they
possibly
could
be
in
order
to
conceal
the
disgust
they
felt
at
blue
beard
and
to
soften
their
refusal
replied
to
this
effect
that
at
present
they
had
no
desire
to
change
their
situation
but
if
they
had
the
one
sister
could
never
think
of
depriving
the
other
of
so
good
a
match
and
that
they
did
not
wish
to
be
separated

having
called
next
day
the
old
lady
told
him
what
her
daughters
had
said
on
which
he
sighed
deeply
and
pretended
to
be
very
much
disappointed
but
as
he
had
the
mother
on
his
side
he
still
continued
his
visits
to
the
family

the
attractions
that

furniture

fine
entertainments
have

the

two
daughters
and
two
or
three
other
ladies

on
a
visit
to
them

spend
a
day
or
two

was
accepted
and
having
spent
a
considerable
time
in
arranging
their
wardrobe
and
in
adorning
their
persons
they
all
set
out
for
the
splendid
mansion
of
blue
beard
on
coming
near
the
castle
although
they
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
the
taste
and
expense
that
had
been
employed
in
decorating
it
they
were
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
trees
that
overshadowed
the
walks
through
which
they
passed
and
with
the
fragrancy
of
the
flowers
which
perfumed
the
air
when
they
reached
the
castle
blue
beard
attended
by
a
number
of
his
servants
in
splendid
dresses
received
them
with
the
most
polite
courtesy

conducted
them
to

elegant
repast

ready

to
which
they
adjourned

they
were
again
astonished
by
the
grandeur
of
the
apartment
and
the
elegance
of
the
entertainment
and
they
felt
so
happy
that
the
evening
passed
away
before
they
were
aware

day
after
they
had
finished
breakfast
the
ladies
proceeded
to
examine
the
pictures
and
furniture

the
rooms

were
open
and
were
truly
astonished
at
the
magnificence

time
rolled
pleasantly
away
amidst
a
succession
of
the
most
agreeable
amusements

of
hunting

and
banquets
where
the
richest
wines
and
most
tempting
delicacies
in
most
luxurious
profusion
presented
themselves
in
every
direction
the
party
felt
so
agreeable
amidst
these
scenes
of
festivity
that
they
continued
at
the
castle
several
days
during
which
the
cunning
blue
beard
by
every
obsequious
service
tried
to
gain
the
favour
of
his
fair
guests

attentions
even
although
paid
us
by
an
ugly
creature
seldom
fail
to
make
a
favourable
impression
it
was
therefore
no
wonder
that
fatima
the
youngest
of
the
two
sisters
began
to
think

very
polite

and
civil
gentleman
and
that

beard
which
she
and

sister
had
been
so
much
afraid
of

time
after
her
return
home
fatima
who
was
delighted
with
the
attention
which
had
been
paid
her
at
the
castle
told
her
mother
that
she
did
not
now
feel
any
objections
to
accept
of

told
his

few
weeks

she
promised
him
implicit
obedience
to
his
orders
and
then
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
where

after
saluting
her
in
a
tender
manner
stepped
into
the
coach
and
drove
away
when

beard
was
gone
fatima
sent
a
kind
invitation
to
her
friends
to
come
immediately
to
the
castle
and
ordered
a
grand
entertainment
to
be
prepared
for

also
sent
a
messenger
to
her
two
brothers
both
officers
in

army
who
were
quartered
about
forty
miles
distant
requesting
they
would

of
which
they
had
heard
so
much
that
in
less
than
two
hours
after
receiving
notice
the
whole
company
were
assembled
with
the
exception
of
her
brothers
who
were
not
expected
till
the
following
day
as
her
guests
had
arrived
long
before
the
time
appointed
them
for
the
entertainment
fatima
took
them
thro
every
apartment
in
the
castle
and
displayed
all
the
wealth
she
had
acquired
by
her
marriage
with
blue
beard
they
went
from
room
to
room
and
from
wardrobe
to
wardrobe
expressing
fresh
wonder
and
delight
at
every
new
object
they
came
to
but
their
surprise
was
increased
when
they
entered
the
and
saw
the
grandeur
of
the
furniture
during
the
day
fatima
was
so
much
engaged
that
she
never
once
thought
of
the
blue
closet
which
blue
beard
had
ordered
her
not
to
open
but
when
all
the
visitors
were
gone
she
felt
a
great
curiosity
to
know
its
contents
she
took
out
the
key
which
was
made
of
the
finest
gold
and
went
to
consult
with
her
sister
on
the
subject
anne
used
every
argument
she
could
think
of
to
dissuade
fatima
from
her
purpose
and
reminded
her
of
the
threats
of
blue
beard
but
all
in
vain
for
fatima
was
now
bent
on
gratifying
her
curiosity
she
therefore
in
spite
of
all
her
sister
could
do
seized
one
of
the
candles
and
hurried
down
stairs
to
the
fatal
closet
on
reaching
the
door
she
stopped
and
began
to
reason
with
herself
on
the
propriety
of
her
conduct
but
her
curiosity
at
length
overcame
every
other
consideration
and
with
a
trembling
hand
she
applied
the
key
to
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
she
had
only
advanced
a
few
steps
when
the
most
frightful
scene
met
her
view
and
struck
with
horror
and
dismay
she
dropped
the
key
of
the
closet
she
was
in
the
midst
of
blood
and
the
heads
bodies
and
mutilated
limbs
of
murdered
ladies
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
these
ladies
had
all
been
married
to
blue
beard
and
had
suffered
for
their
imprudent
curiosity
the
key
which
was
the
gift
of
a
fairy
always
betraying
their
fatal
disobedience
illustration
the
terror
of
fatima
was
not
diminished
on
observing
these
dreadful
words
on
the
wall
reward
of
disobedience
and
imprudent
curiosity
she
trembled
violently
but
on
recovering
a
little
she
snatched
up
the
key
and
having
again
locked
the
door
left
this
abode
of
horror
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
sister
chamber
she
related
the
whole
of
her
horrid
adventure
they
then
examined
the
key
but
it
was
all
covered
with
blood
and
they
both
turned
pale
with
fear
they
spent
a
good
part
of
the
night
in
trying
to
clean
off
the
blood
from
the
key
but
it
was
without
effect
for
though
they
washed
and
scoured
it
with
brick
dust
and
sand
no
sooner
was
the
blood
removed
from
one
side
than
it
appeared
on
the
other
fatigued
with
their
exertions
they
at
last
retired
to
bed
where
they
passed
a
sleepless
and
anxious
night
fatima
rose
at
a
late
hour
next
day
and
consulted
with
her
sister
how
she
ought
to
proceed
she
thought
first
of
escaping
from
the
castle
but
as
her
brothers
were
expected
in
an
hour
or
two
she
resolved
to
wait
their
arrival
a
loud
knock
at
the
gate
made
her
almost
leap
for
joy
and
she
cried
they
are
come
they
are
come
but
what
was
her
consternation
when
blue
beard
hastily
opened
the
door
and
entered
it
was
impossible
for
fatima
to
conceal
her
agitation
although
she
pretended
to
be
very
happy
at
his
sudden
and
unexpected
return
blue
beard
who
guessed
what
she
had
been
about
requested
the
keys
in
order
as
he
said
that
he
might
change
his
dress
she
went
to
her
chamber
and
soon
returned
with
the
keys
all
except
the
one
belonging
to
the
blue
closet
he
took
the
keys
from
her
with
seeming
indifference
and
after
glancing
at
them
minutely
said
rather
sternly
how
is
this
fatima
i
do
not
see
the
key
of
the
blue
closet
here
go
and
bring
it
to
me
instantly
the
poor
girl
feeling
the
crisis
of
her
fate
approaching
said
i
will
go
and
search
for
it
and
left
the
apartment
in
tears
she
went
straight
to
her
sister
chamber
where
they
again
tried
but
in
vain
to
remove
the
blood
from
the
key
the
voice
of
blue
beard
again
calling
for
her
she
was
forced
to
return
and
reluctantly
to
give
him
the
fatal
key
illustration
on
examining
the
key
blue
beard
burst
into
a
terrible
rage
pray
madam
said
he
how
came
this
blood
to
be
here
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
replied
she
trembling
and
turning
pale
what
do
you
not
know
cried
blue
beard
in
a
voice
like
thunder
which
made
poor
fatima
start
with
fear
but
i
know
well
you
have
been
in
the
forbidden
blue
closet
and
since
you
are
so
fond
of
prying
into
secrets
you
shall
take
up
your
abode
with
the
ladies
you
saw
there
illustration
almost
expiring
with
fear
and
terror
the
trembling
fatima
sunk
upon
her
knees
and
implored
him
in
the
most
piteous
manner
to
forgive
her
but
the
cruel
blue
beard
deaf
to
her
intreaties
drew
his
dreadful
scymetar
and
bid
her
prepare
for
immediate
death
blue
beard
had
raised
his
arm
to
give
the
fatal
blow
when
a
dreadful
shriek
from
her
sister
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
apartment
arrested
his
attention
she
entreated
him
to
spare
the
life
of
fatima
but
he
was
deaf
to
her
intercession
and
would
only
grant
her
one
quarter
of
an
hour
that
she
might
make
her
peace
with
heaven
before
he
put
her
to
death
blue
beard
then
dragged
her
up
to
a
large
hall
in
the
top
of
the
tower
of
the
castle
to
prevent
her
groans
being
heard
to
which
they
were
followed
by
her
sister
he
then
told
her
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
time
as
she
might
expect
his
return
the
moment
it
elapsed
and
immediately
left
the
place
when
alone
with
her
sister
fatima
felt
her
dreadful
situation
and
again
burst
into
tears
only
fifteen
minutes
between
her
and
the
most
cruel
death
without
the
least
chance
of
escape
for
blue
beard

secured
the
door
when
he
retired
and
the

battlements
fatima
thoughts
were
now
turned
to
her
brothers
whom
she
expected
that
day
and
she
requested
her
sister
to
ascend
to
the
top
of
the
tower
to
see
if
there
was
any
appearance
of
them
fatima
sister
immediately
ascended
to
the
top
of
the
battlements
while
the
poor
trembling
girl
below
every
minute
cried
out
sister
anne
my
dear
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
yet
her
sister
always
replied
there
is
not
a
human
being
in
view
and
i
see
nothing
but
the
sun
and
the
grass
she
was
upon
her
knees
bewailing
her
fate
when
blue
beard
in
a
tremendous
voice
cried
out
are
you
ready
the
time
is
expired
and
she
heard
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
approaching
she
again
supplicated
him
to
allow
her
five
minutes
longer
to
finish
her
prayers
which
he
knowing
she
was
completely
within
his
power
granted
her
and
again
left
her
fatima
again
renewed
her
inquiries
to
her
sister
do
you
see
any
one
coming
yet
her
sister
replied
there
is
not
a
human
being
within
sight
when
the
five
minutes
were
elapsed
the
voice
of
blue
beard
was
heard
bawling
out
are
you
ready
yet
she
again
beseeched
him
to
allow
her
only
two
minutes
more
and
then
addressed
her
sister
dear
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
yet
illustration
i
see
said
her
sister
a
cloud
of
dust
rising
a
little
to
the
left
in
breathless
agitation
she
cried
do
you
think
it
is
my
brothers
alas
no
my
dearest
fatima
returned
her
sister
it
is
only
a
flock
of
sheep
again
the
voice
of
blue
beard
was
heard
and
she
begged
for
one
minute
longer
she
then
called
out
for
the
last
time
sister
anne
do
you
see
no
one
coming
yet
her
sister
quickly
answered
i
see
two
men
on
horseback
but
they
are
still
a
great
way
off
thank
heaven
exclaimed
fatima
i
shall
yet
be
saved
for
it
must
be
my
two
brothers
my
dearest
sister
make
every
signal
in
your
power
to
hasten
them
forward
or
they
will
be
too
late
blue
beard
patience
being
now
exhausted
he
burst
open
the
door
in
a
rage
and
made
a
blow
at
the
wretched
fatima
with
the
intention
of
striking
off
her
head
but
she
sprang
close
to
him
and
evaded
it
furious
at
being
foiled
in
his
aim
he
threw
her
from
him
and
then
seizing
her
by
the
hair
of
the
head
was
in
the
act
of
striking
her
a
blow
with
his
scymetar
when
the
noise
of
persons
approaching
with
hasty
steps
arrested
the
progress
of
his
sanguinary
arm
blue
beard
had
not
time
to
conjecture
who
the
intruders
might
be
when
the
door
opened
and
two
officers
with
their
swords
drawn
rushed
into
the
apartment
illustration
struck
with
terror
the
guilty
wretch
released
his
wife
from
his
grasp
and
without
attempting
to
resist
he
tried
to
effect
his
escape
from
the
resentment
of
her
brothers
but
they
pursued
and
seized
him
before
he
had
got
above
twenty
paces
from
the
place
after
reproaching
blue
beard
with
his
cruelty
they
dragged
him
back
to
the
spot
where
he
intended
to
have
murdered
their
sister
and
there
stabbing
him
to
the
heart
with
their
swords
he
expired
uttering
the
most
horrid
oaths
and
execrations
fatima
who
had
fallen
to
the
ground
at
the
time
blue
beard
quitted
his
hold
of
her
still
lay
in
the
same
situation
insensible
for
the
appearance
of
her
brothers
at
the
moment
she
expected
certain
death
had
thrown
her
into
a
faint
which
continued
during
the
whole
of
the
time
they
were
engaged
in
despatching
her
husband
the
two
young
officers
now
turned
their
attention
to
their
sister
whom
they
raised
from
the
ground
but
she
could
hardly
be
persuaded
of
her
safety
till
they
pointed
to
where
blue
beard
lay
extended
and
lifeless
fatima
on
recovering
a
little
tenderly
embraced
her
deliverers
and
the
appearance
of
their
sister
anne
who
had
come
down
from
the
top
of
the
battlements
added
to
their
happiness
illustration
as
all
those
horrid
murders
which
had
been
committed
by
blue
beard
were
unknown
to
his
domestics
on
whose
credulity
he
imposed
by
falsehoods
which
they
had
no
means
of
detecting
fatima
and
her
brothers
thought
the
most
prudent
way
to
act
was
to
assemble
them
together
and
then
disclose
the
wickedness
of
their
late
master
by
the
direction
of
fatima
her
two
brothers
conducted
all
the
servants
to
the
dreadful
scene
of
her
husband
cruelties
and
then
showing
them
his
dead
body
related
the
whole
occurrences
which
had
taken
place
they
all
said
that
his
punishment
was
not
adequate
to
what
he
deserved
and
begged
that
they
might
be
continued
in
the
service
of
their
mistress
as
blue
beard
had
no
relations
fatima
was
sole
heir
to
the
whole
of
his
immense
property
and
mistress
of
the
castle
in
the
possession
of
which
she
was
confirmed
by
the
laws
of
the
country
she
then
sent
notice
to
all
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
death
of
her
husband
and
the
horrid
proofs
of
his
cruelty
were
laid
open
for
two
days
to
all
who
chose
to
inspect
them
he
was
then
buried
privately
along
with
all
the
bodies
of
the
ladies
he
had
murdered
and
the
fatal
closet
underwent
a
complete
repair
which
removed
every
trace
of
his
barbarity
soon
after
this
fatima
gave
a
magnificent
entertainment
to
all
her
friends
where
happiness
was
seen
in
every
face
and
on
this
occasion
the
poor
who
were
assembled
for
many
miles
round
partook
most
liberally
of
her
bounty
though
possessed
of
riches
almost
inexhaustible
fatima
disposed
of
them
with
so
much
discretion
that
she
gained
the
esteem
of
every
one
who
knew
her
she
bestowed
handsome
fortunes
on
her
two
brothers
and
to
her
sister
who
was
married
about
two
months
after
she
gave
a
very
large
dowry
the
beauty
riches
and
amiable
conduct
of
fatima
attracted
a
number
of
admirers
and
among
others
a
young
nobleman
of
very
high
rank
who
to
a
handsome
person
added
every
quality
calculated
to
make
a
good
husband
and
after
a
reasonable
time
spent
in
courtship
their
marriage
was
celebrated
with
great
rejoicings
