preface
the
past
may
be
forgotten
but
it
never
dies
the
elements
which
in
the
most
remote
times
have
entered
into
a
nation
s
composition
endure
through
all
its
history
and
help
to
mould
that
history
and
to
stamp
the
character
and
genius
of
the
people
the
examination
therefore
of
these
elements
and
the
recognition
as
far
as
possible
of
the
part
they
have
actually
contributed
to
the
warp
and
weft
of
a
nation
s
life
must
be
a
matter
of
no
small
interest
and
importance
to
those
who
realise
that
the
present
is
the
child
of
the
past
and
the
future
of
the
present
who
will
not
regard
themselves
their
kinsfolk
and
their
as
mere
transitory
phantoms
hurrying
from
darkness
into
darkness
but
who
know
that
in
them
a
vast
historic
stream
of
national
life
is
passing
from
its
distant
and
mysterious
origin
towards
a
future
which
is
largely
conditioned
by
all
the
past
wanderings
of
that
human
stream
but
which
is
also
in
no
small
degree
what
they
by
their
courage
their
patriotism
their
knowledge
and
their
understanding
choose
to
make
it
the
part
played
by
the
celtic
race
as
a
formative
influence
in
the
history
the
literature
and
the
art
of
the
people
inhabiting
the
british
people
which
from
that
centre
has
spread
its
dominions
over
so
vast
an
area
of
the
earth
s
been
unduly
obscured
in
popular
thought
for
this
the
current
use
of
the
term
applied
to
the
british
people
as
a
designation
of
race
is
largely
responsible
historically
the
term
is
quite
misleading
there
is
nothing
to
justify
this
singling
out
of
two
tribes
when
we
wish
to
indicate
the
of
the
british
people
the
use
of
it
leads
to
such
absurdities
as
that
which
the
writer
noticed
not
long
ago
when
the
proposed
elevation
by
the
pope
of
an
irish
bishop
to
a
cardinalate
was
described
in
an
english
newspaper
as
being
prompted
by
the
desire
of
the
head
of
the
catholic
church
to
pay
a
compliment
to
the
the
true
term
for
the
population
of
these
islands
and
for
the
typical
and
dominant
part
of
the
population
of
north
america
is
not
but
it
is
precisely
in
this
blend
of
germanic
and
celtic
elements
that
the
british
people
are
is
precisely
this
blend
which
gives
to
this
people
the
fire
the
and
in
literature
and
art
the
sense
of
style
colour
drama
which
are
not
common
growths
of
german
soil
while
at
the
same
time
it
gives
the
deliberateness
and
depth
the
reverence
for
ancient
law
and
custom
and
the
passion
for
personal
freedom
which
are
more
or
less
strange
to
the
romance
nations
of
the
south
of
europe
may
they
never
become
strange
to
the
british
islands
nor
is
the
celtic
element
in
these
islands
to
be
regarded
as
contributed
wholly
or
even
very
predominantly
by
the
populations
of
the
celtic
it
is
now
well
known
to
ethnologists
that
the
saxons
did
not
by
any
means
exterminate
the
celtic
or
celticised
populations
whom
they
found
in
possession
of
great
britain
nicholson
librarian
of
the
bodleian
writes
in
his
important
work
keltic
researches
names
which
have
not
been
purposely
invented
to
describe
race
must
never
be
taken
as
proof
of
race
but
only
as
proof
of
community
of
language
or
community
of
political
organisation
we
call
a
man
who
speaks
english
lives
in
england
and
bears
an
obviously
english
name
such
as
freeman
or
newton
an
englishman
yet
from
the
statistics
of
relative
nigrescence
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
lancashire
west
yorkshire
staffordshire
worcestershire
warwickshire
leicestershire
rutland
cambridgeshire
wiltshire
somerset
and
part
of

are
as

and
north

that
cheshire
shropshire
herefordshire
monmouthshire
gloucestershire
devon
dorset
northamptonshire
huntingdonshire
and
bedfordshire
are
more
equal
to
north
wales
and
leinster
while
buckinghamshire
and
hertfordshire
exceed
even
this
degree
and
are
on
a
level
with
south
wales
and
it
is
then
for
an
not
an
people
that
this
account
of
the
early
history
the
religion
and
the
mythical
and
romantic
literature
of
the
celtic
race
is
written
it
is
hoped
that
that
people
will
find
in
it
things
worthy
to
be
remembered
as
contributions
to
the
general
stock
of
european
culture
but
worthy
above

to

chapter
i
the
celts
in
ancient
history
in
the
chronicles
of
the
classical
nations
for
about
five
hundred
years
previous
to
the
christian
era
there
are
frequent
references
to
a
people
associated
with
these
nations
sometimes
in
peace
sometimes
in
war
and
evidently
occupying
a
position
of
great
strength
and
influence
in
the
terra
incognita
of
this
people
is
called
by
the
greeks
the
hyperboreans
or
celts
the
latter
term
being
first
found
in
the
geographer
hecatæsus
about
herodotus
about
half
a
century
later
speaks
of
the
celts
as
dwelling
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules
in
also
of
the
danube
as
rising
in
their
country
aristotle
knew
that
they
dwelt
beyond
spain
that
they
had
captured
rome
and
that
they
set
great
store
by
warlike
power
references
other
than
geographical
are
occasionally
met
with
even
in
early
writers
hellanicus
of
lesbos
an
historian
of
the
fifth
century
describes
the
celts
as
practising
justice
and
righteousness
ephorus
about
has
three
lines
of
verse
about
the
celts
in
which
they
are
described
as
using
the
same
customs
as
the
greeks
that
may
being
on
the
friendliest
terms
with
that
people
who
established
guest
friendships
among
them
plato
however
in
the
laws
classes
the
celts
among
the
races
who
are
drunken
and
combative
and
much
barbarity
is
attributed
to
them
on
the
occasion
of
their
irruption
into
greece
and
the
sacking
of
delphi
in
the
year
their
attack
on
rome
and
the
sacking
of
that
city
by
them
about
a
century
earlier
is
one
of
the
landmarks
of
ancient
history
the
history
of
this
people
during
the
time
when
they
were
the
dominant
power
in
has
to
be
divined
or
reconstructed
from
scattered
references
and
from
accounts
of
episodes
in
their
dealings
with
greece
and
rome
very
much
as
the
figure
of
a
primæval
monster
is
reconstructed
by
the
zoologist
from
a
few
fossilised
bones
no
chronicles
of
their
own
have
come
down
to
us
no
architectural
remains
have
survived
a
few
coins
and
a
few
ornaments
and
weapons
in
bronze
decorated
with
enamel
or
with
subtle
and
beautiful
designs
in
chased
or
repoussé
and
the
names
which
often
cling
in
strangely
altered
forms
to
the
places
where
they
dwelt
from
the
euxine
to
the
british
islands
are
all
the
visible
traces
which
this
once
mighty
power
has
left
us
of
its
civilisation
and
dominion
yet
from
these
and
from
the
accounts
of
classical
writers
much
can
be
deduced
with
certainty
and
much
more
can
be
conjectured
with
a
very
fair
measure
of
probability
the
great
celtic
scholar
whose
loss
we
have
recently
had
to
deplore
d
arbois
de
jubainville
has
on
the
available
data
drawn
a
convincing
outline
of
celtic
history
for
the
period
prior
to
their
emergence
into
full
historical
light
with
the
conquests
of
cæsar
and
it
is
this
outline
of
which
the
main
features
are
reproduced
here
true
celtic
to
begin
with
we
must
dismiss
the
idea
that
celtica
was
ever
inhabited
by
a
single
pure
and
homogeneous
race
the
true
celts
if
we
accept
on
this
point
the
carefully
studied
and
elaborately
argued
conclusion
of
rice
holmes
supported
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
antiquity
were
a
tall
fair
race
warlike
and
masterful
whose
place
of
origin
as
far
as
we
can
trace
them
was
somewhere
about
the
sources
of
the
danube
and
who
spread
their
dominion
both
by
conquest
and
by
peaceful
infiltration
over
gaul
spain
and
the
british
islands
they
did
not
exterminate
the
original
prehistoric
inhabitants
of
these
and
neolithic
races
and
workers
in
they
imposed
on
them
their
language
their
arts
and
their
traditions
taking
no
doubt
a
good
deal
from
them
in
return
especially
as
we
shall
see
in
the
important
matter
of
religion
among
these
races
the
true
celts
formed
an
aristocratic
and
ruling
caste
in
that
capacity
they
stood
alike
in
gaul
in
spain
in
britain
and
in
ireland
in
the
forefront
or
armed
opposition
to
foreign
invasion
they
bore
the
worst
brunt
of
war
of
confiscations
and
of
banishment
they
never
lacked
valour
but
they
were
not
strong
enough
or
united
enough
to
prevail
and
they
perished
in
far
greater
proportion
than
the
earlier
populations
whom
they
had
themselves
subjugated
but
they
disappeared
also
by
mingling
their
blood
with
these
inhabitants
whom
they
impregnated
with
many
of
their
own
noble
and
virile
qualities
hence
it
comes
that
the
characteristics
of
the
peoples
called
celtic
in
the
present
day
and
who
carry
on
the
celtic
tradition
and
language
are
in
some
respects
so
different
from
those
of
the
celts
of
classical
history
and
the
celts
who
produced
the
literature
and
art
of
ancient
ireland
and
in
others
so
strikingly
similar
to
take
a
physical
characteristic
alone
the
more
celtic
districts
of
the
british
islands
are
at
present
marked
by
darkness
of
complexion
hair
they
are
not
very
dark
but
they
are
darker
than
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
but
the
true
celts
were
certainly
fair
even
the
irish
celts
of
the
twelfth
century
are
described
by
giraldus
cambrensis
as
a
fair
race
age
of
the
but
we
are
anticipating
and
must
return
to
the
period
of
the
origins
of
celtic
history
as
astronomers
have
discerned
the
existence
of
an
unknown
planet
by
the
perturbations
which
it
has
caused
in
the
courses
of
those
already
under
direct
observation
so
we
can
discern
in
the
fifth
and
fourth
centuries
before
christ
the
presence
of
a
great
power
and
of
mighty
movements
going
on
behind
a
veil
which
will
never
be
lifted
now
this
was
the
golden
age
of
celtdom
in
continental
europe
during
this
period
the
celts
waged
three
great
and
successful
wars
which
had
no
little
influence
on
the
course
of
south
european
history
about
they
conquered
spain
from
the
carthaginians
a
century
later
we
find
them
engaged
in
the
conquest
of
northern
italy
from
the
etruscans
they
settled
in
large
numbers
in
the
territory
afterwards
known
as
cisalpine
gaul
where
many
names
such
as
milan
adda
verduno
and
perhaps
garlic
testify
still
to
their
occupation
they
left
a
greater
memorial
in
the
chief
of
latin
poets
whose
name
vergil
appears
to
bear
evidence
of
his
celtic
ancestry
towards
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
they
overran
pannonia
conquering
the
illyrians
with
the
all
these
wars
were
undertaken
in
alliance
with
the
greeks
with
whom
the
celts
were
at
this
period
on
the
friendliest
terms
by
the
war
with
the
carthaginians
the
monopoly
held
by
that
people
of
the
trade
in
tin
with
britain
and
in
silver
with
the
miners
of
spain
was
broken
down
and
the
overland
route
across
france
to
britain
for
the
sake
of
which
the
phocæans
had
in
created
the
port
of
marseilles
was
definitely
secured
to
greek
trade
greeks
and
celts
were
at
this
period
allied
against
phœnicians
and
persians
the
defeat
of
hamilcar
by
gelon
at
himera
in
sicily
took
place
in
the
same
year
as
that
of
xerxes
at
salamis
the
carthaginian
army
in
that
expedition
was
made
up
of
mercenaries
from
half
a
dozen
different
nations
but
not
a
celt
is
found
in
the
carthaginian
ranks
and
celtic
hostility
must
have
counted
for
much
in
preventing
the
carthaginians
from
lending
help
to
the
persians
for
the
overthrow
of
their
common
enemy
these
facts
show
that
celtica
played
no
small
part
in
preserving
the
greek
type
of
civilisation
from
being
overwhelmed
by
the
despotisms
of
the
east
and
thus
in
keeping
alive
in
europe
the
priceless
seed
of
freedom
and
humane
culture
the
when
the
of
hellas
against
the
east
began
under
alexander
the
great
we
find
the
celts
again
appearing
as
a
factor
of
importance
in
the
fourth
century
macedon
was
attacked
and
almost
obliterated
by
thracian
and
illyrian
hordes
king
amyntas
ii
was
defeated
and
driven
into
exile
his
son
perdiccas
ii
was
killed
in
battle
when
philip
a
younger
brother
of
perdiccas
came
to
the
obscure
and
tottering
throne
which
he
and
his
successors
were
to
make
the
seat
of
a
great
empire
he
was
powerfully
aided
in
making
head
against
the
illyrians
by
the
conquests
of
the
celts
in
the
valleys
of
the
danube
and
the
po
the
alliance
was
continued
and
rendered
perhaps
more
formal
in
the
days
of
alexander
when
about
to
undertake
his
conquest
of
asia
alexander
first
made
a
compact
with
the
celts
who
dwelt
by
the
ionian
gulf
in
order
to
secure
his
greek
dominions
from
attack
during
his
absence
the
episode
is
related
by
ptolemy
soter
in
his
history
of
the
wars
of
alexander
it
has
a
vividness
which
stamps
it
as
a
bit
of
authentic
history
and
another
singular
testimony
to
the
truth
of
the
narrative
has
been
brought
to
light
by
de
jubainville
as
the
celtic
envoys
who
are
described
as
men
of
haughty
bearing
and
great
stature
their
mission
concluded
were
drinking
with
the
king
he
asked
them
it
is
said
what
was
the
thing
they
the
celts
most
feared
the
envoys
replied
we
fear
no
man
there
is
but
one
thing
that
we
fear
namely
that
the
sky
should
fall
on
us
but
we
regard
nothing
so
much
as
the
friendship
of
a
man
such
as
alexander
bade
them
farewell
and
turning
to
his
nobles
whispered
what
a
vainglorious
people
are
these
celts
yet
the
answer
for
all
its
celtic
bravura
and
flourish
was
not
without
both
dignity
and
courtesy
the
reference
to
the
falling
of
the
sky
seems
to
give
a
glimpse
of
some
primitive
belief
or
myth
of
which
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
discover
the
meaning
the
national
oath
by
which
the
celts
bound
themselves
to
the
observance
of
their
covenant
with
alexander
is
remarkable
if
we
observe
not
this
engagement
they
said
may
the
sky
fall
on
us
and
crush
us
may
the
earth
gape
and
swallow
us
up
may
the
sea
burst
out
and
overwhelm
de
jubainville
draws
attention
most
appositely
to
a
passage
from
the
táin
bo
cuailgne
in
the
book
of
leinster
where
the
ulster
heroes
declare
to
their
king
who
wished
to
leave
them
in
battle
in
order
to
meet
an
attack
in
another
part
of
the
field
heaven
is
above
us
and
earth
beneath
us
and
the
sea
is
round
about
us
unless
the
sky
shall
fall
with
its
showers
of
stars
on
the
ground
where
we
are
camped
or
unless
the
earth
shall
be
rent
by
an
earthquake
or
unless
the
waves
of
the
blue
sea
come
over
the
forests
of
the
living
world
we
shall
not
give
this
survival
of
a
peculiar
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
and
its
reappearance
after
being
first
heard
of
among
the
celts
of
in
a
mythical
romance
of
ireland
is
certainly
most
curious
and
with
other
facts
which
we
shall
note
hereafter
speaks
strongly
for
the
community
and
persistence
of
celtic
culture
sack
of
we
have
mentioned
two
of
the
great
wars
of
the
continental
celts
we
come
now
to
the
third
that
with
the
etruscans
which
ultimately
brought
them
into
conflict
with
the
greatest
power
of
pagan
europe
and
led
to
their
proudest
feat
of
arms
the
sack
of
rome
about
the
year
the
celtic
empire
seems
to
have
reached
the
height
of
its
power
under
a
king
named
by
livy
ambicatus
who
was
probably
the
head
of
a
dominant
tribe
in
a
military
confederacy
like
the
german
emperor
in
the
present
day
the
celts
seem
to
have
been
welded
into
a
considerable
degree
of
political
unity
and
to
have
followed
a
consistent
policy
attracted
by
the
rich
land
of
northern
italy
they
poured
down
through
the
passes
of
the
alps
and
after
hard
fighting
with
the
etruscan
inhabitants
they
maintained
their
ground
there
at
this
time
the
romans
were
pressing
on
the
etruscans
from
below
and
roman
and
celt
were
acting
in
definite
concert
and
alliance
but
the
romans
despising
perhaps
the
northern
barbarian
warriors
had
the
rashness
to
play
them
false
at
the
siege
of
clusium
a
place
which
the
romans
regarded
as
one
of
the
bulwarks
of
latium
against
the
north
the
celts
recognised
romans
who
had
come
to
them
in
the
sacred
character
of
ambassadors
fighting
in
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
the
events
which
followed
are
as
they
have
come
down
to
us
much
mingled
with
legend
but
there
are
certain
touches
of
dramatic
vividness
in
which
the
true
character
of
the
celts
appears
distinctly
recognisable
they
applied
we
are
told
to
rome
for
satisfaction
for
the
treachery
of
the
envoys
who
were
three
sons
of
fabius
ambustus
the
chief
pontiff
the
romans
refused
to
listen
to
the
claim
and
elected
the
fabii
military
tribunes
for
the
ensuing
year
then
the
celts
abandoned
the
siege
of
clusium
and
marched
straight
on
rome
the
army
showed
perfect
discipline
there
was
no
indiscriminate
plundering
and
devastation
no
city
or
fortress
was
assailed
we
are
bound
for
rome
was
their
cry
to
the
guards
upon
the
walls
of
the
provincial
towns
who
watched
the
host
in
wonder
and
fear
as
it
rolled
steadily
to
the
south
at
last
they
reached
the
river
allia
a
few
miles
from
rome
where
the
whole
available
force
of
the
city
was
ranged
to
meet
them
the
battle
took
place
on
july
that
which
long
perpetuated
in
the
roman
calendar
the
memory
of
the
deepest
shame
the
republic
had
ever
known
the
celts
turned
the
flank
of
the
roman
army
and
annihilated
it
in
one
tremendous
charge
three
days
later
they
were
in
rome
and
for
nearly
a
year
they
remained
masters
of
the
city
or
of
its
ruins
till
a
great
fine
had
been
exacted
and
full
vengeance
taken
for
the
perfidy
at
clusium
for
nearly
a
century
after
the
treaty
thus
concluded
there
was
peace
between
the
celts
and
the
romans
and
the
breaking
of
that
peace
when
certain
celtic
tribes
allied
themselves
with
their
old
enemy
the
etruscans
in
the
third
samnite
war
was
coincident
with
the
breaking
up
of
the
celtic
empire
two
questions
must
now
be
considered
before
we
can
leave
the
historical
part
of
this
introduction
first
of
all
what
are
the
evidences
for
the
widespread
diffusion
of
celtic
power
in
during
this
period
secondly
where
were
the
germanic
peoples
and
what
was
their
position
in
regard
to
the
celts
in
to
answer
these
questions
fully
would
take
us
for
the
purposes
of
this
volume
too
deeply
into
philological
discussions
which
only
the
celtic
scholar
can
fully
appreciate
the
evidence
will
be
found
fully
set
forth
in
de
jubainville
s
work
already
frequently
referred
to
the
study
of
european
forms
the
basis
of
the
argument
take
the
celtic
name
composed
of
two
celtic
words
the
adjective
meaning
new
and
irish
a
field
or
plain
there
were
nine
places
of
this
name
known
in
antiquity
six
were
in
france
among
them
the
places
now
called
noyon
in
oise
nijon
in
vosges
nyons
in
drôme
three
outside
of
france
were
nimègue
in
belgium
neumagen
in
the
rhineland
and
one
at
speyer
in
the
palatinate
the
word
so
often
traceable
in
gaelic
in
the
present
day
dundalk
dunrobin
and
meaning
fortress
or
castle
is
another
typically
celtic
element
in
european
it
occurred
very
frequently
in
lyons
verdun
it
is
also
found
in
moudon
yverdon
in
the
netherlands
where
the
famous
city
of
leyden
goes
back
to
a
celtic
in
great
britain
the
celtic
term
was
often
changed
by
simple
translation
into
thus
became
colchester
brancaster
in
spain
and
portugal
eight
names
terminating
in
are
mentioned
by
classical
writers
in
germany
the
modern
names
kempton
karnberg
liegnitz
go
back
respectively
to
the
celtic
forms
and
we
find
a
now
belgrade
in
servia
a
now
isaktscha
in
roumania
a
in
south
russia
near
the
dniester
and
another
in
croatia
now
pitsmeza
now
rodez
in
france
turns
up
also
in
bavaria
wurzburg
and
in
england
now
wallsend
in
northumberland
and
the
first
term
is
traceable
in
segorbe
in
spain
is
a
celtic
word
the
origin
of
the
german
and
equivalent
in
meaning
to
one
more
example
the
word
a
plain
which
is
very
frequent
as
an
element
of
irish
is
found
abundantly
in
france
and
outside
of
france
in
countries
no
longer
celtic
it
appears
in
switzerland
now
promasens
in
the
rhineland
brumath
in
the
netherlands
as
already
noted
nimègue
in
lombardy
several
times
and
in
austria
the
examples
given
are
by
no
means
exhaustive
but
they
serve
to
indicate
the
wide
diffusion
of
the
celts
in
europe
and
their
identity
of
language
over
their
vast
territory
celtic
the
relics
of
ancient
celtic
tell
the
same
story
in
the
year
a
great
necropolis
was
discovered
at
hallstatt
near
salzburg
in
austria
it
contains
relics
believed
by
arthur
evans
to
date
from
about
to
these
relics
betoken
in
some
cases
a
high
standard
of
civilisation
and
considerable
commerce
amber
from
the
baltic
is
there
phoenician
glass
and
of
oriental
workmanship
iron
swords
are
found
whose
hilts
and
sheaths
are
richly
decorated
with
gold
ivory
and
amber
the
celtic
culture
illustrated
by
the
remains
at
hallstatt
developed
later
into
what
is
called
the
la
tène
culture
la
tène
was
a
settlement
at
the
end
of
the
lake
of
neuchâtel
and
many
objects
of
great
interest
have
been
found
there
since
the
site
was
first
explored
in
these
antiquities
represent
according
to
evans
the
culminating
period
of
gaulish
civilisation
and
date
from
round
about
the
third
century
the
type
of
art
here
found
must
be
judged
in
the
light
of
an
observation
recently
made
by
romilly
allen
in
his
celtic
art
the
great
difficulty
in
understanding
the
evolution
of
celtic
art
lies
in
the
fact
that
although
the
celts
never
seem
to
have
invented
any
new
ideas
they
possessed
an
extraordinary
aptitude
for
picking
up
ideas
from
the
different
peoples
with
whom
war
or
commerce
brought
them
into
contact
and
once
the
celt
had
borrowed
an
idea
from
his
neighbours
he
was
able
to
give
it
such
a
strong
celtic
tinge
that
it
soon
became
something
so
different
from
what
it
was
originally
as
to
be
almost
now
what
the
celt
borrowed
in
the
which
on
the
continent
culminated
in
the
la
tène
relics
were
certain
originally
naturalistic
motives
for
greek
ornaments
notably
the
palmette
and
the
meander
motives
but
it
was
characteristic
of
the
celt
that
he
avoided
in
his
art
all
imitation
of
or
even
approximation
to
the
natural
forms
of
the
plant
and
animal
world
he
reduced
everything
to
pure
decoration
what
he
enjoyed
in
decoration
was
the
alternation
of
long
sweeping
curves
and
undulations
with
the
concentrated
energy
of
spirals
or
bosses
and
with
these
simple
elements
and
with
the
suggestion
of
a
few
motives
derived
from
greek
art
he
elaborated
a
most
beautiful
subtle
and
varied
system
of
decoration
applied
to
weapons
ornaments
and
to
toilet
and
household
appliances
of
all
kinds
in
gold
bronze
wood
and
stone
and
possibly
if
we
had
the
means
of
judging
to
textile
fabrics
also
one
beautiful
feature
in
the
decoration
of
seems
to
have
entirely
originated
in
celtica
enamelling
was
unknown
to
the
classical
nations
till
they
learned
from
the
celts
so
late
as
the
third
century
it
was
still
strange
to
the
classical
world
as
we
learn
from
the
reference
of
philostratus
they
say
that
the
barbarians
who
live
in
the
ocean
britons
pour
these
colours
upon
heated
brass
and
that
they
adhere
become
hard
as
stone
and
preserve
the
designs
that
are
made
upon
anderson
writes
in
the
proceedings
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
of
scotland
the
gauls
as
well
as
the
the
same
celtic
before
the
roman
conquest
the
enamel
workshops
of
bibracte
with
their
furnaces
crucibles
moulds
and
with
the
crude
enamels
in
their
various
stages
of
preparation
have
been
recently
excavated
from
the
ruins
of
the
city
destroyed
by
caesar
and
his
legions
but
the
bibracte
enamels
are
the
work
of
mere
dabblers
in
the
art
compared
with
the
british
examples
the
home
of
the
art
was
britain
and
the
style
of
the
pattern
as
well
as
the
association
in
which
the
objects
decorated
with
it
were
found
demonstrated
with
certainty
that
it
had
reached
its
highest
stage
of
indigenous
development
before
it
came
in
contact
with
the
roman
the
national
museum
in
dublin
contains
many
superb
examples
of
irish
decorative
art
in
gold
bronze
and
enamels
and
the
strong
celtic
tinge
of
which
romilly
allen
speaks
is
as
clearly
observable
there
as
in
the
relics
of
hallstatt
or
la
tène
everything
then
speaks
of
a
community
of
culture
an
identity
of
existing
over
the
vast
territory
known
to
the
ancient
world
as
and
but
as
we
have
said
before
this
territory
was
by
no
means
inhabited
by
the
celt
alone
in
particular
we
have
to
ask
who
and
where
were
the
germans
the
tribes
who
eventually
took
the
place
of
the
celts
as
the
great
northern
menace
to
classical
civilisation
they
are
mentioned
by
pytheas
the
eminent
greek
traveller
and
geographer
about
but
they
play
no
part
in
history
till
under
the
name
of
cimbri
and
teutones
they
descended
on
italy
to
be
vanquished
by
marius
at
the
close
of
the
second
century
the
ancient
greek
geographers
prior
to
pytheas
know
nothing
of
them
and
assign
all
the
territories
now
known
as
germanic
to
various
celtic
tribes
the
explanation
given
by
de
jubainville
and
based
by
him
on
various
philological
considerations
is
that
the
germans
were
a
subject
people
comparable
to
those
tribes
who
existed
in
gaul
and
in
ancient
ireland
they
lived
under
the
celtic
dominion
and
had
no
independent
political
existence
de
jubainville
finds
that
all
the
words
connected
with
law
and
government
and
war
which
are
common
both
to
the
celtic
and
teutonic
languages
were
borrowed
by
the
latter
from
the
former
chief
among
them
are
the
words
represented
by
the
modern
german
empire
office
and
the
gothic
a
king
all
of
which
are
of
unquestioned
celtic
origin
de
jubainville
also
numbers
among
loan
words
from
celtic
the
words
an
order
free
a
hostage
an
inheritance
value
sacred
a
slave
gothic
a
wife
old
high
german
a
slave
gothic
battle
old
german
a
hero
from
the
same
root
as
the
word
celt
an
army
celtic
victory
booty
a
castle
and
many
others
the
etymological
history
of
some
of
these
words
is
interesting
for
instance
that
word
of
so
much
significance
in
modern
german
administration
goes
back
to
an
ancient
celtic
which
is
compounded
of
the
words
about
and
a
past
participle
derived
from
the
celtic
root
meaning
to
act
now
descends
from
the
primitive
where
the
initial
is
a
kind
of
vowel
afterwards
represented
in
sanscrit
by
this
vowel
became
in
those
germanic
words
which
derive
directly
from
the
primitive
tongue
but
the
word
which
is
now
represented
by
appears
in
its
earliest
germanic
form
as
thus
making
plain
its
descent
from
the
celtic
again
the
word
is
found
in
its
earliest
germanic
form
as
which
comes
from
the
primitive
the
word
here
does
not
however
mean
free
it
means
beloved
sanscrit
in
the
celtic
language
however
we
find
dropping
its
initial
difficulty
in
pronouncing
this
letter
was
a
marked
feature
in
ancient
celtic
it
changed
according
to
a
regular
rule
into
and
appears
in
modern
welsh
as
the
meaning
persists
in
the
germanic
languages
in
the
name
of
the
and
in
the
word
friend
peace
the
sense
borne
by
the
word
in
the
sphere
of
civil
right
is
traceable
to
a
celtic
origin
and
in
that
sense
appears
to
have
been
a
loan
from
celtic
the
german
booty
plunder
has
had
an
instructive
history
there
was
a
gaulish
word
found
in
compounds
such
as
the
segobodium
seveux
and
various
personal
and
tribal
names
including
boudicca
better
known
to
us
as
the
british
warrior
queen
boadicea
this
word
meant
anciently
but
the
fruits
of
victory
are
spoil
and
in
this
material
sense
the
word
was
adopted
in
german
in
french
in
norse
and
the
welsh
on
the
other
hand
the
word
preserved
its
elevated
significance
in
irish
in
the
irish
translation
of
chronicles
xxix
where
the
vulgate
original
has
tua
est
domine
magnificentia
et
potentia
et
gloria
et
victoria
the
word
is
rendered
by
the
irish
and
as
de
jubainville
remarks
ce
n
est
pas
de
butin
qu
il
s
he
goes
on
to
say
has
preserved
in
irish
thanks
to
a
vigorous
and
persistent
literary
culture
the
high
meaning
which
it
bore
in
the
tongue
of
the
gaulish
aristocracy
the
material
sense
of
the
word
was
alone
perceived
by
the
lower
classes
of
the
population
and
it
is
the
tradition
of
this
lower
class
which
has
been
preserved
in
the
german
the
french
and
the
cymric
two
things
however
the
celts
either
could
not
or
would
not
impose
on
the
subjugated
german
language
and
their
religion
in
these
two
great
factors
of
and
pride
lay
the
seeds
of
the
ultimate
german
uprising
and
overthrow
of
the
celtic
supremacy
the
names
of
the
german
are
different
from
those
of
the
celtic
deities
their
funeral
customs
with
which
are
associated
the
deepest
religious
conceptions
of
primitive
races
are
different
the
celts
or
at
least
the
dominant
section
of
them
buried
their
dead
regarding
the
use
of
fire
as
a
humiliation
to
be
inflicted
on
criminals
or
upon
slaves
or
prisoners
in
those
terrible
human
sacrifices
which
are
the
greatest
stain
on
their
native
culture
the
germans
on
the
other
hand
burned
their
illustrious
dead
on
pyres
like
the
early
a
pyre
could
not
be
afforded
for
the
whole
body
the
noblest
parts
such
as
the
head
and
arms
were
burned
and
the
rest
buried
of
the
celtic
what
exactly
took
place
at
the
time
of
the
german
revolt
we
shall
never
know
certain
it
is
however
that
from
about
the
year
onward
the
celts
appear
to
have
lost
whatever
political
cohesion
and
common
purpose
they
had
possessed
rent
asunder
as
it
were
by
the
upthrust
of
some
mighty
subterranean
force
their
tribes
rolled
down
like
to
the
south
east
and
west
of
their
original
home
some
found
their
way
into
northern
greece
where
they
committed
the
outrage
which
so
scandalised
their
former
friends
and
allies
in
the
sack
of
the
shrine
of
delphi
others
renewed
with
worse
fortune
the
old
struggle
with
rome
and
perished
in
vast
numbers
at
sentinum
and
lake
vadimo
one
detachment
penetrated
into
asia
minor
and
founded
the
celtic
state
of
galatia
where
as
jerome
attests
a
celtic
dialect
was
still
spoken
in
the
fourth
century
others
enlisted
as
mercenary
troops
with
carthage
a
tumultuous
war
of

against
scattered
german
tribes

against

conquest

on

over

when
this

practically
the
sole

of
the
celtic

the
commencement
of

era
gaul
and
britain
had
fallen
under
the
yoke
of
rome
and
their
complete
romanisation
was
only
a
question
of
time
historical
position
of
ireland
alone
was
never
even
visited
much
less
subjugated
by
the
roman
legionaries
and
maintained
its
independence
against
all
comers
nominally
until
the
close
of
the
twelfth
century
but
for
all
practical
purposes
a
good
three
hundred
years
longer
ireland
has
therefore
this
unique
feature
of
interest
that
it
carried
an
indigenous
celtic
civilisation
celtic
institutions
art
and
literature
and
the
oldest
surviving
form
of
the
celtic
language
right
across
the
chasm
which
separates
the
antique
from
the
modern
world
the
pagan
from
the
christian
world
and
on
into
the
full
light
of
modern
history
and
observation
celtic
the
moral
no
less
than
the
physical
characteristics
attributed
by
classical
writers
to
the
celtic
peoples
show
a
remarkable
distinctness
and
consistency
much
of
what
is
said
about
them
might
as
we
should
expect
be
said
of
any
primitive
and
unlettered
people
but
there
remains
so
much
to
differentiate
them
among
the
races
of
mankind
that
if
these
ancient
references
to
the
celts
could
be
read
aloud
without
mentioning
the
name
of
the
race
to
whom
they
referred
to
any
person
acquainted
with
it
through
modern
history
alone
he
would
i
think
without
hesitation
name
the
celtic
peoples
as
the
subject
of
the
description
which
he
had
heard
some
of
these
references
have
already
been
quoted
and
we
need
not
repeat
the
evidence
derived
from
plato
ephorus
or
arrian
but
an
observation
of
porcius
cato
on
the
gauls
may
be
adduced
there
are
two
things
he
says
to
which
the
gauls
are
art
of
war
and
subtlety
of
speech
rem
militarem
et
argute
loqui
s
cæsar
has
given
us
a
careful
and
critical
account
of
them
as
he
knew
them
in
gaul
they
were
he
says
eager
for
battle
but
easily
dashed
by
reverses
they
were
extremely
superstitious
submitting
to
their
druids
in
all
public
and
private
affairs
and
regarding
it
as
the
worst
of
punishments
to
be
excommunicated
and
forbidden
to
approach
thu
ceremonies
of
religion
they
who
are
thus
interdicted
for
refusing
to
obey
a
druidical
sentence
are
reckoned
in
the
number
of
the
vile
and
wicked
all
persons
avoid
and
fly
their
company
and
discourse
lest
they
should
receive
any
infection
by
contagion
they
are
not
permitted
to
commence
a
suit
neither
is
any
post
entrusted
to
them
the
druids
are
generally
freed
from
military
service
nor
do
they
pay
taxes
with
the
rest
encouraged
by
such
rewards
many
of
their
own
accord
come
to
their
schools
and
are
sent
by
their
friends
and
relations
they
are
said
there
to
get
by
heart
a
great
number
of
verses
some
continue
twenty
years
in
their
education
neither
is
it
held
lawful
to
commit
these
things
the
druidic
doctrines
to
writing
though
in
almost
all
public
transactions
and
private
accounts
they
use
the
greek
the
gauls
were
eager
for
news
besieging
merchants
and
travellers
for
gossip
easily
influenced
sanguine
credulous
fond
of
change
and
wavering
in
their
counsels
they
were
at
the
same
time
remarkably
acute
and
intelligent
very
quick
to
seize
upon
and
to
imitate
any
contrivance
they
found
useful
their
ingenuity
in
baffling
the
novel
siege
apparatus
of
the
roman
armies
is
specially
noticed
by
cæsar
of
their
courage
he
speaks
with
great
respect
attributing
their
scorn
of
death
in
some
degree
at
least
to
their
firm
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
a
people
who
in
earlier
days
had
again
and
again
annihilated
roman
armies
had
sacked
rome
and
who
had
more
than
once
placed
cæsar
himself
in
positions
of
the
utmost
anxiety
and
peril
were
evidently
no
weaklings
whatever
their
religious
beliefs
or
practices
cæsar
is
not
given
to
sentimental
admiration
of
his
foes
but
one
episode
at
the
siege
of
avaricum
moves
him
to
immortalise
the
valour
of
the
defence
a
wooden
structure
or
had
been
raised
by
the
romans
to
overtop
the
walls
which
had
proved
impregnable
to
the
assaults
of
the
the
gauls
contrived
to
set
this
on
fire
it
was
of
the
utmost
moment
to
prevent
the
besiegers
from
extinguishing
the
flames
and
a
gaul
mounted
a
portion
of
the
wall
above
the
throwing
down
upon
it
balls
of
tallow
and
pitch
which
were
handed
up
to
him
from
within
he
was
soon
struck
down
by
a
missile
from
a
roman
catapult
immediately
another
stepped
over
him
as
he
lay
and
continued
his
comrade
s
task
he
too
fell
but
a
third
instantly
took
his
place
and
a
fourth
nor
was
this
post
ever
deserted
until
the
legionaries
at
last
extinguished
the
flames
and
forced
the
defenders
back
into
the
town
which
was
finally
captured
on
the
following
day
on
the
the
geographer
and
traveller
strabo
who
died
and
was
therefore
a
little
later
than
cæsar
has
much
to
tell
us
about
the
celts
he
notices
that
their
country
in
this
case
gaul
is
thickly
inhabited
and
well
is
no
waste
of
natural
resources
the
women
are
prolific
and
notably
good
mothers
he
describes
the
men
as
warlike
passionate
disputatious
easily
provoked
but
generous
and
unsuspicious
and
easily
vanquished
by
stratagem
they
showed
themselves
eager
for
culture
and
greek
letters
and
science
had
spread
rapidly
among
them
from
massilia
public
education
was
established
in
their
towns
they
fought
better
on
horseback
than
on
foot
and
in
strabo
s
time
formed
the
flower
of
the
roman
cavalry
they
dwelt
in
great
houses
made
of
arched
timbers
with
walls
of
doubt
plastered
with
clay
and
lime
as
in
thickly
thatched
towns
of
much
importance
were
found
in
gaul
and
cæsar
notes
the
strength
of
their
walls
built
of
stone
and
timber
both
cæsar
and
strabo
agree
that
there
was
a
very
sharp
division
between
the
nobles
and
priestly
or
educated
class
on
the
one
hand
and
the
common
people
on
the
other
the
latter
being
kept
in
strict
subjection
the
social
division
corresponds
roughly
no
doubt
to
the
race
distinction
between
the
true
celts
and
the
aboriginal
populations
subdued
by
them
while
cæsar
tells
us
that
the
druids
taught
the
immortality
of
the
soul
strabo
adds
that
they
believed
in
the
indestructibility
which
implies
in
some
sense
the
divinity
of
the
material
universe
the
celtic
warrior
loved
display
everything
that
gave
brilliance
and
the
sense
of
drama
to
life
appealed
to
him
his
weapons
were
richly
ornamented
his
were
wrought
in
bronze
and
enamel
of
design
as
exquisite
as
any
relic
of
mycenean
or
cretan
art
his
raiment
was
embroidered
with
gold
the
scene
of
the
surrender
of
vercingetorix
when
his
heroic
struggle
with
rome
had
come
to
an
end
on
the
fall
of
alesia
is
worth
recording
as
a
typically
celtic
blend
of
chivalry
and
of
what
appeared
to
the
romans
childish
ostentation
when
he
saw
that
the
cause
was
lost
he
summoned
a
tribal
council
and
told
the
assembled
chiefs
whom
he
had
led
through
a
glorious
though
unsuccessful
war
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
himself
for
his
still
faithful
might
send
his
head
to
cæsar
if
they
liked
or
he
would
voluntarily
surrender
himself
for
the
sake
of
getting
easier
terms
for
his
countrymen
the
latter
alternative
was
chosen
vercingetorix
then
armed
himself
with
his
most
splendid
weapons
decked
his
horse
with
its
richest
trappings
and
after
riding
thrice
round
the
roman
camp
went
before
cæsar
and
laid
at
his
feet
the
sword
which
was
the
sole
remaining
defence
of
gallic
independence
cæsar
sent
him
to
rome
where
he
lay
in
prison
for
six
years
and
was
finally
put
to
death
when
cæsar
celebrated
his
triumph
but
the
celtic
love
of
splendour
and
of
art
were
mixed
with
much
barbarism
strabo
tells
us
how
the
warriors
rode
home
from
victory
with
the
heads
of
fallen
foemen
dangling
from
their
horses
necks
just
as
in
the
irish
saga
the
ulster
hero
cuchulain
is
represented
as
driving
back
to
emania
from
a
foray
into
connacht
with
the
heads
of
his
enemies
hanging
from
his
their
domestic
arrangements
were
rude
they
lay
on
the
ground
to
sleep
sat
on
couches
of
straw
and
their
women
worked
in
the
fields
a
characteristic
scene
from
the
battle
of
clastidium
is
recorded
by
polybius
the
gæsati
he
tells
us
who
were
in
the
forefront
of
the
celtic
army
stripped
naked
for
the
fight
and
the
sight
of
these
warriors
with
their
great
stature
and
their
fair
skins
on
which
glittered
the
collars
and
bracelets
of
gold
so
loved
as
an
adornment
by
all
the
celts
filled
the
roman
legionaries
with
awe
yet
when
the
day
was
over
those
golden
ornaments
went
in
cartloads
to
deck
the
capitol
of
rome
and
the
final
comment
of
polybius
on
the
character
of
the
celts
is
that
they
i
say
not
usually
but
always
in
everything
they
attempt
are
driven
headlong
by
their
passions
and
never
submit
to
the
laws
of
as
might
be
expected
the
chastity
for
which
the
germans
were
noted
was
never
until
recent
times
a
celtic
characteristic
diodorus
siculus
a
contemporary
of
julius
cæsar
and
augustus
who
had
travelled
in
gaul
confirms
in
the
main
the
accounts
of
cæsar
and
strabo
but
adds
some
interesting
details
he
notes
in
particular
the
gallic
love
of
gold
even
cuirasses
were
made
of
it
this
is
also
a
very
notable
trait
in
celtic
ireland
where
an
astonishing
number
of
prehistoric
gold
relics
have
been
found
while
many
more
now
lost
are
known
to
have
existed
the
temples
and
sacred
places
say
posidonius
and
diodorus
were
full
of
unguarded
offerings
of
gold
which
no
one
ever
touched
he
mentions
the
great
reverence
paid
to
the
bards
and
like
cato
notices
something
peculiar
about
the
kind
of
speech
which
the
educated
gauls
cultivated
they
are
not
a
talkative
people
and
are
fond
of
expressing
themselves
in
enigmas
so
that
the
hearer
has
to
divine
the
most
part
of
what
they
would
this
exactly
answers
to
the
literary
language
of
ancient
ireland
which
is
curt
and
allusive
to
a
degree
the
druid
was
regarded
as
the
prescribed
intermediary
between
god
and
one
could
perform
a
religious
act
without
his
assistance
ammianus
marcellinus
who
wrote
much
later
in
the
latter
half
of
the
fourth
century
had
also
visited
gaul
which
was
then
of
course
much
romanised
he
tells
us
however
like
former
writers
of
the
great
stature
fairness
and
arrogant
bearing
of
the
gallic
warrior
he
adds
that
the
people
especially
in
aquitaine
were
singularly
clean
and
proper
in
their
one
was
to
be
seen
in
rags
the
gallic
woman
he
describes
as
very
tall
and
singularly
beautiful
but
a
certain
amount
of
awe
is
mingled
with
his
evident
admiration
for
he
tells
us
that
while
it
was
dangerous
enough
to
get
into
a
fight
with
a
gallic
man
your
case
was
indeed
desperate
if
his
wife
with
her
huge
snowy
arms
which
could
strike
like
catapults
came
to
his
assistance
one
is
irresistibly
reminded
of
the
gallery
of
vigorous
independent
women
like
maeve
grania
findabair
deirdre
and
the
historic
boadicea
who
figure
in
the
myths
and
in
the
history
of
the
british
islands
holmes
on
the
the
following
passage
from
rice
holmes
cæsar
s
conquest
of
gaul
may
be
taken
as
an
admirable
summary
of
the
social
physiognomy
of
that
part
of
celtica
a
little
before
the
time
of
the
christian
era
and
it
corresponds
closely
to
all
that
is
known
of
the
native
irish
civilisation
the
gallic
peoples
had
risen
far
above
the
condition
of
savages
and
the
celticans
of
the
interior
many
of
whom
had
already
fallen
under
roman
influence
had
attained
a
certain
degree
of
civilisation
and
even
of
luxury
their
trousers
from
which
the
province
took
its
name
of
gallia
bracata
and
their
tartan
skirts
and
cloaks
excited
the
astonishment
of
their
conquerors
the
chiefs
wore
rings
and
bracelets
and
necklaces
of
gold
and
when
these
tall
warriors
rode
forth
to
battle
with
their
helmets
wrought
in
the
shape
of
some
fierce
beast
s
head
and
surmounted
by
nodding
plumes
their
chain
armour
their
long
bucklers
and
their
huge
clanking
swords
they
made
a
splendid
show
walled
towns
or
large
villages
the
strongholds
of
the
various
tribes
were
conspicuous
on
numerous
hills
the
plains
were
dotted
by
scores
of
oper
hamlets
the
houses
built
of
timber
and
wickerwork
were
large
and
well
thatched
the
fields
in
summer
were
yellow
with
corn
roads
ran
from
town
to
town
rude
bridges
spanned
the
rivers
and
barges
laden
with
merchandise
floated
along
them
ships
clumsy
indeed
but
larger
than
any
that
were
seen
on
the
mediterranean
braved
the
storms
of
the
bay
of
biscay
and
carried
cargoes
between
the
ports
of
brittany
and
the
coast
of
britain
tolls
were
exacted
on
the
goods
which
were
transported
on
the
great
waterways
and
it
was
from
the
farming
of
these
dues
that
the
nobles
derived
a
large
part
of
their
wealth
every
tribe
had
its
coinage
and
the
knowledge
of
writing
in
greek
and
roman
characters
was
not
confined
to
the
priests
the
æduans
were
familiar
with
the
plating
of
copper
and
of
tin
the
miners
of
aquitaine
of
auvergne
and
of
the
berri
were
celebrated
for
their
skill
indeed
in
all
that
belonged
to
outward
prosperity
the
peoples
of
gaul
had
made
great
strides
since
their
kinsmen
first
came
into
contact
with
of
the
celtic
yet
this
native
celtic
civilisation
in
many
respects
so
attractive
and
so
promising
had
evidently
some
defect
or
disability
which
prevented
the
celtic
peoples
from
holding
their
own
either
against
the
ancient
civilisation
of
the
world
or
against
the
rude
young
vigour
of
the
teutonic
races
let
us
consider
what
this
was
classical
at
the
root
of
the
success
of
classical
nations
lay
the
conception
of
the
civic
community
the
the
as
a
kind
of
divine
entity
the
foundation
of
blessing
to
men
venerable
for
its
age
yet
renewed
in
youth
with
every
generation
a
power
which
a
man
might
joyfully
serve
knowing
that
even
if
not
remembered
in
its
records
his
faithful
service
would
outlive
his
own
petty
life
and
go
to
exalt
the
life
of
his
motherland
or
city
for
all
future
time
in
this
spirit
socrates
when
urged
to
evade
his
death
sentence
by
taking
the
means
of
escape
from
prison
which
his
friends
offered
him
rebuked
them
for
inciting
him
to
an
impious
violation
of
his
country
s
laws
for
a
man
s
country
he
says
is
more
holy
and
venerable
than
father
or
mother
and
he
must
quietly
obey
the
laws
to
which
he
has
assented
by
living
under
them
all
his
life
or
incur
the
just
wrath
of
their
great
brethren
the
laws
of
the
underworld
before
whom
in
the
end
he
must
answer
for
his
conduct
on
earth
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
this
exalted
conception
of
the
state
formed
the
practical
religion
of
every
man
among
the
classical
nations
of
antiquity
and
gave
to
the
state
its
cohesive
power
its
capability
of
endurance
and
of
progress
with
the
teuton
the
cohesive
force
was
supplied
by
another
motive
one
which
was
destined
to
mingle
with
the
civic
motive
and
to
form
in
union
with
often
in
predominance
over
main
political
factor
in
the
development
of
the
european
nations
this
was
the
sentiment
of
what
the
germans
called
the
personal
fidelity
to
a
chief
which
in
very
early
times
extended
itself
to
a
royal
dynasty
a
sentiment
rooted
profoundly
in
the
teutonic
nature
and
one
which
has
never
been
surpassed
by
any
other
human
impulse
as
the
source
of
heroic
no
human
influences
are
ever
found
pure
and
unmixed
the
sentiment
of
personal
fidelity
was
not
unknown
to
the
classical
nations
the
sentiment
of
civic
patriotism
though
of
slow
growth
among
the
teutonic
races
did
eventually
establish
itself
there
neither
sentiment
was
unknown
to
the
celt
but
there
was
another
force
which
in
his
case
overshadowed
and
dwarfed
them
and
supplied
what
it
could
of
the
political
inspiration
and
unifying
power
which
the
classical
nations
got
from
patriotism
and
the
teutons
from
loyalty
this
was
religion
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
codified
in
dogma
and
administered
by
a
priestly
caste
the
druids
as
we
have
seen
from
cæsar
whose
observations
are
entirely
confirmed
by
strabo
and
by
references
in
irish
legends
were
the
really
sovran
power
in
celtica
all
affairs
public
and
private
were
subject
to
their
authority
and
the
penalties
which
they
could
inflict
for
any
assertion
of
lay
independence
though
resting
for
their
efficacy
like
the
mediæval
interdicts
of
the
catholic
church
on
popular
superstition
alone
were
enough
to
quell
the
proudest
spirit
here
lay
the
real
weakness
of
the
celtic
polity
there
is
perhaps
no
law
written
more
conspicuously
in
the
teachings
of
history
than
that
nations
who
are
ruled
by
priests
drawing
their
authority
from
supernatural
sanctions
are
just
in
the
measure
that
they
are
so
ruled
incapable
of
true
national
progress
the
free
healthy
current
of
secular
life
and
thought
is
in
the
very
nature
of
things
incompatible
with
priestly
rule
be
the
creed
what
it
may
druidism
islam
judaism
christianity
or
fetichism
a
priestly
caste
claiming
authority
in
temporal
affairs
by
virtue
of
sanctions
is
inevitably
the
enemy
of
that
spirit
of
criticism
of
that
influx
of
new
ideas
of
that
growth
of
secular
thought
of
human
and
rational
authority
which
are
the
elementary
conditions
of
national
development
cursing
of
a
singular
and
very
cogent
illustration
of
this
truth
can
be
drawn
from
the
history
of
the
early
celtic
world
in
the
sixth
century
a
little
over
a
hundred
years
after
the
preaching
of
christianity
by
patrick
a
king
named
dermot
mackerval
ruled
in
ireland
he
was
the
ard
righ
or
high
king
of
that
country
whose
seat
of
government
was
at
tara
in
meath
and
whose
office
with
its
nominal
and
legal
superiority
to
the
five
provincial
kings
represented
the
impulse
which
was
moving
the
irish
people
towards
a
true
national
unity
the
first
condition
of
such
a
unity
was
evidently
the
establishment
of
an
effective
central
authority
such
an
authority
as
we
have
said
the
high
king
in
theory
represented
now
it
happened
that
one
of
his
officers
was
murdered
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
by
a
chief
named
hugh
guairy
guairy
was
the
brother
of
a
bishop
who
was
related
by
fosterage
to
ruadan
of
lorrha
and
when
king
dermot
sent
to
arrest
the
murderer
these
clergy
found
him
a
dermot
however
caused
a
search
to
be
made
haled
him
forth
from
under
the
roof
of
ruadan
and
brought
him
to
tara
for
trial
immediately
the
ecclesiastics
of
ireland
made
common
cause
against
the
lay
ruler
who
had
dared
to
execute
justice
on
a
criminal
under
clerical
protection
they
assembled
at
tara
fasted
against
the
king
and
laid
their
solemn
malediction
upon
him
and
the
seat
of
his
government
then
the
chronicler
tells
us
that
dermot
s
wife
had
a
prophetic
dream
upon
tara
s
green
was
a
vast
and
tree
and
eleven
slaves
hewing
at
it
but
every
chip
that
they
knocked
from
it
would
return
into
its
place
again
and
there
adhere
instantly
till
at
last
there
came
one
man
that
dealt
the
tree
but
a
stroke
and
with
that
single
cut
laid
it
the
fair
tree
was
the
irish
monarchy
the
twelve
hewers
were
the
twelve
saints
or
apostles
of
ireland
and
the
one
who
laid
it
low
was
ruadan
the
plea
of
the
king
for
his
country
whose
fate
he
saw
to
be
hanging
in
the
balance
is
recorded
with
moving
force
and
insight
by
the
irish
chronicler
alas
he
said
for
the
iniquitous
contest
that
ye
have
waged
against
me
seeing
that
it
is
ireland
s
good
that
i
pursue
and
to
preserve
her
discipline
and
royal
right
but
tis
ireland
s
unpeace
and
murderousness
that
ye
endeavour
but
ruadan
said
desolate
be
tara
for
ever
and
ever
and
the
popular
awe
of
the
ecclesiastical
malediction
prevailed
the
criminal
was
surrendered
tara
was
abandoned
and
except
for
a
brief
space
when
a
strong
usurper
brian
boru
fought
his
way
to
power
ireland
knew
no
effective
secular
government
till
it
was
imposed
upon
her
by
a
conqueror
the
last
words
of
the
historical
tract
from
which
we
quote
are
dermot
s
cry
of
despair
woe
to
him
that
with
the
clergy
of
the
churches
battle
this
remarkable
incident
has
been
described
at
some
length
because
it
is
typical
of
a
factor
whose
profound
influence
in
moulding
the
history
of
the
celtic
peoples
we
can
trace
through
a
succession
of
critical
events
from
the
time
of
julius
caesar
to
the
present
day
how
and
whence
it
arose
we
shall
consider
later
here
it
is
enough
to
call
attention
to
it
it
is
a
factor
which
forbade
the
national
development
of
the
celts
in
the
sense
in
which
we
can
speak
of
that
of
the
classical
or
the
teutonic
peoples
europe
owes
to
the
yet
to
suppose
that
on
this
account
the
celt
was
not
a
force
of
any
real
consequence
in
europe
would
be
altogether
a
mistake
his
contribution
to
the
culture
of
the
western
world
was
a
very
notable
one
for
some
four
to
was
the
refuge
of
learning
and
the
source
of
literary
and
philosophic
culture
for
half
europe
the
of
celtic
poetry
have
probably
played
the
main
part
in
determining
the
structure
of
all
modern
verse
the
myths
and
legends
of
the
gaelic
and
cymric
peoples
kindled
the
imagination
of
a
host
of
continental
poets
true
the
celt
did
not
himself
create
any
great
architectural
work
of
literature
just
as
he
did
not
create
a
stable
or
imposing
national
polity
his
thinking
and
feeling
were
essentially
lyrical
and
concrete
each
object
or
aspect
of
life
impressed
him
vividly
and
stirred
him
profoundly
he
was
sensitive
impressionable
to
the
last
degree
but
did
not
see
things
in
their
larger
and
more
relations
he
had
little
gift
for
the
establishment
or
institutions
for
the
service
of
principles
but
he
was
and
is
an
indispensable
and
assertor
of
humanity
as
against
the
tyranny
of
principles
the
coldness
and
barrenness
of
institutions
the
institutions
of
royalty
and
of
civic
patriotism
are
both
very
capable
of
being
fossilised
into
barren
formulae
and
thus
of
fettering
instead
of
inspiring
the
soul
but
the
celt
has
always
been
a
rebel
against
anything
that
has
not
in
it
the
breath
of
life
against
any
unspiritual
and
purely
external
form
of
domination
it
is
too
true
that
he
has
been
to
enjoy
the
fine
fruits
of
life
without
the
long
and
patient
preparation
for
the
harvest
but
he
has
done
and
will
still
do
infinite
service
to
the
modern
world
in
insisting
that
the
true
fruit
of
life
is
a
spiritual
reality
never
without
pain
and
loss
to
be
obscured
or
forgotten
amid
the
vast
mechanism
of
a
material
civilisation
chapter
ii
the
religion
of
the
celts
and
the
celtic
we
have
said
that
the
irish
among
the
celtic
peoples
possess
the
unique
interest
of
having
carried
into
the
light
of
modern
historical
research
many
of
the
features
of
a
native
celtic
civilisation
there
is
however
one
thing
which
they
did
not
carry
across
the
gulf
which
divides
us
from
the
ancient
this
was
their
religion
it
was
not
merely
that
they
changed
it
they
left
it
behind
them
so
entirely
that
all
record
of
it
is
lost
patrick
himself
a
celt
who
apostolised
ireland
during
the
fifth
century
has
left
us
an
autobiographical
narrative
of
his
mission
a
document
of
intense
interest
and
the
earliest
extant
record
of
british
christianity
but
in
it
he
tells
us
nothing
of
the
doctrines
he
came
to
supplant
we
learn
far
more
of
celtic
religious
beliefs
from
julius
cæsar
who
approached
them
from
quite
another
side
the
copious
legendary
literature
which
took
its
present
form
in
ireland
between
the
seventh
and
the
twelfth
centuries
though
often
manifestly
going
back
to
sources
shows
us
beyond
a
belief
in
magic
and
a
devotion
to
certain
ceremonial
or
chivalric
observances
practically
nothing
resembling
a
religious
or
even
an
ethical
system
we
know
that
certain
chiefs
and
bards
offered
a
long
resistance
to
the
new
faith
and
that
this
resistance
came
to
the
arbitrament
of
battle
at
moyrath
in
the
sixth
century
but
no
echo
of
any
intellectual
controversy
no
matching
of
one
doctrine
against
another
such
as
we
find
for
instance
in
the
records
of
the
controversy
of
celsus
with
origen
has
reached
us
from
this
period
of
change
and
strife
the
literature
of
ancient
ireland
as
we
shall
see
embodied
many
ancient
myths
and
traces
appear
in
it
of
beings
who
must
at
one
time
have
been
gods
or
elemental
powers
but
all
has
been
emptied
of
religious
significance
and
turned
to
romance
and
beauty
yet
not
only
was
there
as
cæsar
tells
us
a
very
religious
system
among
the
gauls
but
we
learn
on
the
same
authority
that
the
british
islands
were
the
authoritative
centre
of
this
system
they
were
so
to
speak
the
rome
of
the
celtic
religion
what
this
religion
was
like
we
have
now
to
consider
as
an
introduction
to
the
myths
and
tales
which
more
or
less
remotely
sprang
from
it
popular
religion
of
the
but
first
we
must
point
out
that
the
celtic
religion
was
by
no
means
a
simple
affair
and
can
not
be
summed
up
as
what
we
call
beside
the
official
religion
there
was
a
body
of
popular
superstitions
and
observances
which
came
from
a
deeper
and
older
source
than
druidism
and
was
destined
long
to
outlive
it
is
far
from
dead
even
yet
megalithic
the
religions
of
primitive
peoples
mostly
centre
on
or
take
their
rise
from
rites
and
practices
connected
with
the
burial
of
the
dead
the
earliest
people
inhabiting
celtic
territory
in
the
west
of
europe
of
whom
we
have
any
distinct
knowledge
are
a
race
without
name
or
known
history
but
by
their
sepulchral
monuments
of
which
so
many
still
exist
we
can
learn
a
great
deal
about
them
they
were
the
megalithic
people
the
builders
of
dolmens
cromlechs
and
chambered
tumuli
of
which
more
than
three
thousand
have
been
counted
in
france
alone
dolmens
are
found
from
scandinavia
southwards
all
down
the
western
lands
of
europe
to
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
round
by
the
mediterranean
coast
of
spain
they
occur
in
some
of
the
western
islands
of
the
mediterranean
and
are
found
in
greece
where
in
mycenæ
an
ancient
dolmen
yet
stands
beside
the
magnificent
of
the
atreidae
roughly
if
we
draw
a
line
from
the
mouth
of
the
rhone
northward
to
varanger
fiord
one
may
say
that
except
for
a
few
mediterranean
examples
all
the
dolmens
in
europe
lie
to
the
west
of
that
line
to
the
east
none
are
found
till
we
come
into
asia
but
they
cross
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
are
found
all
along
the
north
african
littoral
and
thence
eastwards
through
arabia
india
and
as
far
as
japan
cromlechs
and
dolmen
at
proleek
ireland
dolmen
at
proleek
ireland
after
borlase
a
dolmen
it
may
be
here
explained
is
a
kind
of
chamber
composed
of
upright
unhewn
stones
and
roofed
generally
with
a
single
huge
stone
they
are
usually
in
plan
and
traces
of
a
porch
or
vestibule
can
often
be
noticed
the
primary
intention
of
the
dolmen
was
to
represent
a
house
or
for
the
dead
a
cromlech
often
confused
in
popular
language
with
the
dolmen
is
properly
a
circular
arrangement
of
standing
stones
often
with
a
dolmen
in
their
midst
it
is
believed
that
most
if
not
all
of
the
now
exposed
dolmens
were
originally
covered
with
a
great
mound
of
earth
or
of
smaller
stones
sometimes
as
in
the
illustration
we
give
from
carnac
in
brittany
great
avenues
or
alignments
are
formed
of
single
upright
stones
and
these
no
doubt
had
some
purpose
connected
with
the
ritual
of
worship
carried
on
in
the
locality
the
later
megalithic
monuments
as
at
stonehenge
may
be
of
dressed
stone
but
in
all
cases
their
rudeness
of
construction
the
absence
of
any
sculpturing
except
for
patterns
or
symbols
incised
on
the
surface
the
evident
aim
at
creating
a
powerful
impression
by
the
brute
strength
of
huge
monolithic
masses
as
well
as
certain
subsidiary
features
in
their
design
which
shall
be
described
later
on
give
these
megalithic
monuments
a
curious
family
likeness
and
mark
them
out
from
the
chambered
tombs
of
the
early
greeks
of
the
egyptians
and
of
other
more
advanced
races
the
dolmens
proper
gave
place
in
the
end
to
great
chambered
mounds
or
tumuli
as
at
new
grange
which
we
also
reckon
as
belonging
to
the
megalithic
people
they
are
a
natural
development
of
the
dolmen
the
early
were
in
the
neolithic
stage
of
culture
their
weapons
were
of
polished
stone
but
in
the
tumuli
not
only
stone
but
also
bronze
and
even
iron
instruments
are
first
evidently
importations
but
afterwards
of
local
manufacture
of
the
megalithic
prehistoric
tumulus
at
new
grange
prehistoric
tumulus

photograph
by
welch
belfast
the
language
originally
spoken
by
this
people
can
only
be
conjectured
by
the
traces
of
it
left
in
that
of
their
conquerors
the
celts
but
a
map
of
the
distribution
or
their
monuments
irresistibly
suggests
the
idea
that
their
builders
were
of
north
african
origin
that
they
were
not
at
first
accustomed
to
traverse
the
sea
for
any
great
distance
that
they
migrated
westwards
along
north
africa
crossed
into
europe
where
the
mediterranean
at
gibraltar
narrows
to
a
strait
of
a
few
miles
in
width
and
thence
spread
over
the
western
regions
of
europe
including
the
british
islands
while
on
the
eastward
they
penetrated
by
arabia
into
asia
it
must
however
be
borne
in
mind
that
while
originally
no
doubt
a
distinct
race
the
megalithic
people
came
in
the
end
to
represent
not
a
race
but
a
culture
the
human
remains
found
in
these
sepulchres
with
their
wide
divergence
in
the
shape
of
the
skull
clearly
prove
this
these
and
other
relics
testify
to
the
in
general
as
representing
a
superior
and
type
acquainted
with
agriculture
pasturage
and
to
some
extent
with
seafaring
the
monuments
themselves
which
are
often
of
imposing
size
and
imply
much
thought
and
organised
effort
in
their
construction
show
unquestionably
the
existence
at
this
period
of
a
priesthood
charged
with
the
care
of
funeral
rites
and
capable
of
controlling
large
bodies
of
men
their
dead
were
as
a
rule
not
burned
but
buried
greater
monuments
marking
no
doubt
the
sepulchres
of
important
personages
while
the
common
people
were
buried
in
tombs
of
which
no
traces
now
exist
celts
of
the
de
jubainville
in
his
account
of
the
early
history
of
the
celts
takes
account
of
two
main
groups
celts
and
the
megalithic
people
but
bertrand
in
his
very
valuable
work
la
religion
des
gaulois
distinguishes
two
elements
among
the
celts
themselves
there
are
besides
the
megalithic
people
the
two
groups
of
lowland
celts
and
mountain
celts
the
lowland
celts
according
to
his
view
started
from
the
danube
and
entered
gaul
probably
about
they
were
the
founders
of
the
in
switzerland
in
the
danube
valley
and
in
ireland
they
knew
the
use
of
metals
and
worked
in
gold
in
tin
in
bronze
and
towards
the
end
of
their
period
in
iron
unlike
the
megalithic
people
they
spoke
a
celtic
tongue
though
bertrand
seems
to
doubt
their
genuine
racial
affinity
with
the
true
celts
they
were
perhaps
celticised
rather
than
actually
celtic
they
were
not
warlike
a
quiet
folk
of
herdsmen
tillers
and
artificers
they
did
not
bury
but
burned
their
dead
at
a
great
settlement
of
theirs
golasecca
in
cisalpine
gaul
interments
were
found
in
each
case
the
body
had
been
burned
there
was
not
a
single
burial
without
previous
burning
this
people
entered
gaul
not
according
to

we
have
a

followed
closely

it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
century
that
it
first
made
its
appearance
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
while
bertrand
calls
the
second
group
celtic
these
he
styles
galatic
and
identifies
them
with
the
galatæ
of
the
greeks
and
the
galli
and
belgæ
of
the
romans
the
second
group
as
we
have
said
were
celts
of
the
plains
the
third
were
celts
of
the
mountains
the
earliest
home
in
which
we
know
them
was
the

of
the
balkans
and
carpathians
their
organisation
was
that

who
fought
for

for

in

and

from
the

of

from
the
sharp
dividing

which
it
drew
between
the
classes

even
there
a
reflexion
of
the
state
of

in

found
even
there
we
find

they
had
also

and

they
were

of
its

but
on
that
of
its
their
bane
and
their
submission
to
it
was
their
fatal
weakness
the
culture
of
these
mountain
celts
differed
markedly
from
that
of
the
lowlanders
their
age
was
the
age
of

not

their
dead
were
not
burned
which
they
considered
a
disgrace

there
were
three
peoples
said
cæsar
inhabiting
gaul
when
his
conquest
began
they
differ
from
each
other
in
language
in
customs
and
in
these
people
he
named
respectively
the
belgæ
the
celtæ
and
the
aquitani
he
locates
them
roughly
the
belgæ
in
the
north
and

the
celtæ
in
the
middle
and
the
aquitani
in
the
west
and
south
the
belgæ
are
the
galatæ
of
bertrand
the
celtæ
are
the
celts
and
the
aquitani
are
the
megalithic
people
they
had
of
course
all
been
more
or
less
brought
under
celtic
influences
and
the
differences
of
language
which
cæsar
noticed
need
not
have
been
great
still
it
is
noteworthy
and
quite
in
accordance
with
bertrand
s
views
that
strabo
speaks
of
the
aquitani
as
differing
markedly
from
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
and
as
resembling
the
iberians
the
language
of
the
other
gaulish
peoples
he
expressly
adds
were
merely
dialects
of
the
same
tongue
religion
of
this
triple
division
is
reflected
more
or
less
in
all
the
celtic
countries
and
must
always
be
borne
in
mind
when
we
speak
of
celtic
ideas
and
celtic
religion
and
try
to
estimate
the
contribution
of
the
celtic
peoples
to
european
culture
the
mythical
literature
and
the
art
of
the
celt
have
probably
sprung
mainly
from
the
section
represented
by
the
lowland
celts
of
bertrand
but
this
literature
of
song
and
saga
was
produced
by
a
bardic
class
for
the
pleasure
and
instruction
of
a
proud
chivalrous
and
warlike
aristocracy
and
would
thus
inevitably
be
moulded
by
the
ideas
of
this
aristocracy
but
it
would
also
have
been
coloured
by
the
profound
influence
of
the
religious
beliefs
and
observances
entertained
by
the
megalithic
which
are
only
now
fading
slowly
away
in
the
spreading
daylight
of
science
these
beliefs
may
be
summed
up
in
the
one
term
magic
the
nature
of
this
religion
of
magic
must
now
be
briefly
discussed
for
it
was
a
potent
element
in
the
formation
of
the
body
of
myths
and
legends
with
which
we
have
afterwards
to
deal
and
as
professor
bury
remarked
in
his
inaugural
lecture
at
cambridge
in
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
that
most
difficult
of
all
inquiries
the
ethnical
problem
the
part
played
by
race
in
the
development
of
peoples
and
the
effects
of
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
celtic
world
commands
one
of
the
chief
portals
of
ingress
into
that
mysterious
foreworld
from
which
it
may
well
be
that
we
modern
europeans
have
inherited
far
more
than
we
the
ultimate
root
of
the
word
magic
is
unknown
but
proximately
it
is
derived
from
the
magi
or
priests
of
chaldea
and
media
in
and
times
who
were
the
great
exponents
of
this
system
of
thought
so
strangely
mingled
of
superstition
philosophy
and
scientific
observation
the
fundamental
conception
of
magic
is
that
of
the
spiritual
vitality
of
all
nature
this
spiritual
vitality
was
not
as
in
polytheism
conceived
as
separated
from
nature
in
distinct
divine
personalities
it
was
implicit
and
immanent
in
nature
obscure
undefined
invested
with
all
the
awfulness
of
a
power
whose
limits
and
nature
are
enveloped
in
impenetrable
mystery
in
its
remote
origin
it
was
doubtless
as
many
facts
appear
to
show
associated
with
the
cult
of
the
dead
for
death
was
looked
upon
as
the
resumption
into
nature
and
as
the
investment
with
vague
and
uncontrollable
powers
of
a
spiritual
force
formerly
embodied
in
the
concrete
limited
manageable
and
therefore
less
awful
form
of
a
living
human
personality
yet
these
powers
were
not
altogether
uncontrollable
the
desire
for
control
as
well
as
the
suggestion
of
the
means
for
achieving
it
probably
arose
from
the
first
rude
practices
of
the
art
of
healing
medicine
of
some
sort
was
one
of
the
earliest
necessities
of
man
and
the
power
of
certain
natural
substances
mineral
or
vegetable
to
produce
bodily
and
mental
effects
often
of
a
most
startling
character
would
naturally
be
taken
as
signal
evidence
of
what
we
may
call
the
magical
conception
of
the
universe
the
first
magicians
were
those
who
attained
a
special
knowledge
of
healing
or
poisonous
herbs
but
virtue
of
some
sort
being
attributed
to
every
natural
object
and
phenomenon
a
kind
of
magical
science
partly
the
child
of
true
research
partly
of
poetic
imagination
partly
of
priestcraft
would
in
time
spring
up
would
be
codified
into
rites
and
formulas
attached
to
special
places
and
objects
and
represented
by
symbols
the
whole
subject
has
been
treated
by
pliny
in
a
remarkable
passage
which
deserves
quotation
at
length
on
the
religion
of
magic
is
one
of
the
few
things
which
it
is
important
to
discuss
at
some
length
were
it
only
because
being
the
most
delusive
of
all
the
arts
it
has
everywhere
and
at
all
times
been
most
powerfully
credited
nor
need
it
surprise
us
that
it
has
obtained
so
vast
an
influence
for
it
has
united
in
itself
the
three
arts
which
have
wielded
the
most
powerful
sway
over
the
spirit
of
man
springing
in
the
first
instance
from
fact
which
no
one
can
under
cover
of
a
solicitude
for
our
health
it
has
glided
into
the
mind
and
taken
the
form
of
another
medicine
more
holy
and
more
profound
in
the
second
place
bearing
the
most
seductive
and
flattering
promises
it
has
enlisted
the
motive
of
religion
the
subject
on
which
even
at
this
day
mankind
is
most
in
the
dark
to
crown
all
it
has
had
recourse
to
the
art
of
astrology
and
every
man
is
eager
to
know
the
future
and
convinced
that
this
knowledge
is
most
certainly
to
be
obtained
from
the
heavens
thus
holding
the
minds
of
men
enchained
in
this
triple
bond
it
has
extended
its
sway
over
many
nations
and
the
kings
of
kings
obey
it
in
the
east
in
the
east
doubtless
it
was
persia
and
by
zoroaster
all
the
authorities
agree
in
this
but
has
there
not
been
more
than
one
zoroaster
i
have
noticed
that
in
ancient
times
and
indeed
almost
always
one
finds
men
seeking
in
this
science
the
climax
of
literary
least
pythagoras
empedocles
democritus
and
plato
crossed
the
seas
exiles
in
truth
rather
than
travellers
to
instruct
themselves
in
this
returning
to
their
native
land
they
vaunted
the
claims
of
magic
and
maintained
its
secret
doctrine
in
the
latin
nations
there
are
early
traces
of
it
as
for
instance
in
our
laws
of
the
twelve
tables
and
other
monuments
as
i
have
said
in
a
former
book
in
fact
it
was
not
until
the
year
after
the
foundation
of
rome
under
the
consulate
of
cornelius
lentulus
crassus
that
it
was
forbidden
by
a
to
sacrifice
human
beings
a
fact
which
proves
that
up
to
this
date
these
horrible
sacrifices
were
made
the
gauls
have
been
captivated
by
it
and
that
even
down
to
our
own
times
for
it
was
the
emperor
tiberius
who
suppressed
the
druids
and
all
the
herd
of
prophets
and
but
what
is
the
use
of
launching
prohibitions
against
an
art
which
has
thus
traversed
the
ocean
and
penetrated
even
to
the
confines
of
nature
xxx
pliny
adds
that
the
first
person
whom
he
can
ascertain
to
have
written
on
this
subject
was
osthanes
who
accompanied
xerxes
in
his
war
against
the
greeks
and
who
propagated
the
germs
of
his
monstrous
art
wherever
he
went
in
europe
magic
was
pliny
either
in
greece
or
in
italy
but
was
so
much
at
home
in
britain
and
conducted
with
such
elaborate
ritual
that
pliny
says
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
it
was
they
who
had
taught
it
to
the
persians
not
the
persians
to
them
of
magic
in
megalithic
the
imposing
relics
of
their
cult
which
the
megalithic
people
have
left
us
are
full
of
indications
of
their
religion
take
for
instance
the
remarkable
tumulus
of
oeck
in
brittany
this
monument
was
explored
in
by
rené
galles
who
describes
it
as
absolutely
surface
of
the
earth
unbroken
and
everything
as
the
builders
left
it
at
the
entrance
to
the
rectangular
chamber
was
a
sculptured
slab
on
which
was
graven
a
mysterious
sign
perhaps
the
totem
of
a
chief
immediately
on
entering
the
chamber
was
found
a
beautiful
pendant
in
green
jasper
about
the
size
of
an
egg
on
the
floor
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
was
a
most
singular
arrangement
consisting
of
a
large
ring
of
jadite
slightly
oval
in
shape
with
a
magnificent
also
of
jadite
its
point
resting
on
the
ring
the
axe
was
a
symbol
of
power
or
godhead
and
is
frequently
found
in
of
the
bronze
age
as
well
as
in
egyptian
hieroglyphs
minoan
carvings
at
a
little
distance
from
these
there
lay
two
large
pendants
of
jasper
then
an
in
white
jade
then
another
jasper
pendant
all
these
objects
were
ranged
with
evident
intention
forming
a
straight
line
which
coincided
exactly
with
one
of
the
diagonals
of
the
chamber
running
from
to
in
one
of
the
corners
of
the
chamber
were
found
in
jade
jadite
and
fibrolite
there
were
no
traces
of
bones
or
cinders
no
funerary
urn
the
structure
was
a
cenotaph
are
we
not
here
asks
bertrand
in
presence
of
some
ceremony
relating
to
the
practices
of
magic
at
gavr
in
connexion
with
the
great
sepulchral
monument
of
gavr
inis
a
very
curious
observation
was
made
by
albert
maitre
an
inspector
of
the
musée
des
antiquités
nationales
there
were
found
commonly
in
other
megalithic
monuments
in
ireland
and
number
of
stones
sculptured
with
a
singular
and
characteristic
design
in
waving
and
concentric
lines
now
if
the
curious
lines
traced
upon
the
human
hand
at
the
roots
and
tips
of
the
fingers
be
examined
under
a
lens
it
will
be
found
that
they
bear
an
exact
resemblance
to
these
designs
of
megalithic
sculpture
one
seems
almost
like
a
cast
of
the
other
these
lines
on
the
human
hand
are
so
distinct
and
peculiar
that
as
is
well
known
they
have
been
adopted
as
a
method
of
identification
of
criminals
can
this
resemblance
be
the
result
of
chance
nothing
like
these
peculiar
assemblages
of
sculptured
lines
has
ever
been
found
except
in
connexion
with
these
monuments
have
we
not
here
a
reference
to
magical
art
much
practised
in
ancient
and
even
in
modern
times
the
hand
as
a
symbol
of
power
was
a
magical
emblem
and
has
entered
largely
even
into
christian
for
instance
the
great
hand
sculptured
on
the
under
side
of
one
of
the
arms
of
the
cross
of
muiredach
at
monasterboice

after
gailhabaud
another
singular
and
as
yet
unexplained
feature
which
appears
in
many
of
these
monuments
from
western
europe
to
india
is
the
presence
of
a
small
hole
bored
through
one
of
the
stones
composing
the
chamber
was
it
an
aperture
intended
for
the
spirit
of
the
dead
or
for
offerings
to
them
or
the
channel
through
which
revelations
from
the
were
supposed
to
come
to
a
priest
or
magician
or
did
it
partake
of
all
these
characters
holed
stones
not
forming

of
a
dolmen
are
of
course
among
the
commonest
relics
of
the
ancient
cult
and
are
still
venerated
and
used
in
practices
connected
with
here
we
are
doubtless
to
interpret
the
emblem
as
a
symbol
of
sex
dolmens
in
the
deccan
india
dolmens
in
the
deccan
india
after
besides
the
heavenly
bodies
we
find
that
rivers
trees
mountains
and
stones
were
all
objects
of
veneration
among
this
primitive
people
was
particularly
common
and
is
not
so
easily
explained
as
the
worship
directed
toward
objects
possessing
movement
and
vitality
possibly
an
explanation
of
the
veneration
attaching
to
great
and
isolated
masses
of
unhewn
stone
may
be
found
in
their
resemblance
to
the
artificial
dolmens
and
cromlechs
no
superstition
has
proved
more
enduring
in
we
find
the
synod
of
arles
denouncing
those
who
venerate
trees
and
wells
and
stones
and
the
denunciation
was
repeated
by
charlemagne
and
by
numerous
synods
and
councils
down
to
recent
times
yet
a
drawing
here
reproduced
which
was
lately
made
on
the
spot
by
arthur
bell
shows
this
very
act
of
worship
still
in
full
force
in
brittany
and
shows
the
symbols
and
the
sacerdotal
organisation
of
christianity
actually
pressed
into
the
service
of
this
immemorial
paganism
according
to
bell
the
clergy
take
part
in
these
performances
with
much
reluctance
but
are
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
force
of
local
opinion
holy
wells
the
water
of
which
is
supposed
to
cure
diseases
are
still
very
common
in
ireland
and
the
cult

on
the

of
a
cylindrical
stone
known
as
the
triumphal

is
carved
a
central
cup
with
nine
concentric
circles
round
it
and
a

cut
straight
from
the

through
all
the
circles
to
the
rim
except
that
the
design
here
is
richly
decorated
and
accurately
drawn
it
closely
resembles
a
typical
european
marking
that
these
markings
mean
something
and
that
wherever
they
are
found
they
mean
the
same
thing
can
hardly
be
doubted
but
what
that
meaning
is
remains
yet
a
puzzle
to
antiquarians
the
guess
may
perhaps
be
hazarded
that
they
are
diagrams
or
plans
of
a
megalithic
sepulchre
the
central
hollow
represents
the
actual
the
circles
are
the
standing
stones
fosses
and
ramparts
which
often
surrounded
it
and
the
line
or
duct
drawn
from
the
centre
outwards
represents
the
subterranean
approach
to
the
sepulchre
the
apparent
avenue
intention
of
the
duct
is
clearly
brought
out
in
the
varieties
given
below
which
i
take
from
simpson
as
the
sepulchre
was
also
a
holy
place
or
shrine
the
occurrence
of
a
representation
of
it
among
other
carvings
of
a
sacred
character
is
natural
enough
it
would
seem
symbolically
to
indicate
that
the
place
was
holy
ground
how
far
this
suggestion
might
apply
to
the
mexican
example

tumulus
at
new
one
of
the
most
important
and
richly
sculptured
of
european
megalithic
monuments
is
the
great
chambered
tumulus
of
new
grange
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
boyne
in
ireland
this
tumulus
and
the
others
which
occur
in
its
neighbourhood
appear
in
ancient
irish
mythical
literature
in
two
different
characters
the
union
of
which
is
significant
they
are
regarded
on
the
one
hand
as
the
of
the
pronounced
shee
or
fairy
folk
who
represent
probably
the
deities
of
the
ancient
irish
and
they
are
also
traditionally
the
of
the
celtic
high
kings
of
pagan
ireland
the
story
of
the
burial
of
king
cormac
who
was
supposed
to
have
heard
of
the
christian
faith
long
before
it
was
actually
preached
in
ireland
by
patrick
and
who
ordered
that
he
should
not
be
buried
at
the
royal
cemetery
by
the
boyne
on
account
of
its
pagan
associations
points
to
the
view
that
this
place
was
the
centre
of
a
pagan
cult
involving
more
than
merely
the
interment
of
royal
personages
in
its
precincts
unfortunately
these
monuments
are
not
intact
they
were
opened
and
plundered
by
the
danes
in
the
ninth
century
but
enough
evidence
remains
to
show
that
they
were
sepulchral
in
their
origin
and
were
also
associated
with
the
cult
of
a
primitive
religion
the
most
important
of
them
the
tumulus
of
new
grange
has
been
thoroughly
explored
and
described
by
george
coffey
keeper
of
the
collection
of
celtic
antiquities
in
the
national
museum
dublin
it
appears
from
the
outside
like
a
large
mound
or
knoll
now
overgrown
with
bushes
it
measures
about
feet
across
at
its
greatest
diameter
and
is
about
feet
in
height
outside
it
there
runs
a
wide
circle
of
standing
stones
originally
it
would
seem
in
number
inside
this
circle
is
a
ditch
and
rampart
and
on
top
of
this
rampart
was
laid
a
circular
curb
of
great
stones
to
feet
long
laid
on
edge
and
confining
what
has
proved
to
be
a
huge
mound
of
loose
stones
now
overgrown
as
we
have
said
with
grass
and
bushes
it
is
in
the
interior
of
this
mound
that
the
interest
of
the
monument
lies
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
some
workmen
who
were
getting
from
the
mound
came
across
the
entrance
to
a
passage
which
led
into
the
interior
and
was
marked
by
the
fact
that
the
boundary
stone
below
it
is
richly
carved
with
spirals
and
lozenges
this
entrance
faces
exactly
the
passage
is
formed
of
upright
slabs
of
unhewn
stone
roofed
with
similar
slabs
and
varies
from
nearly
feet
to
feet
inches
in
height
it
is
about
feet
wide
and
runs
for
feet
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
mound
here
it
ends
in
a
cruciform
chamber
feet
high
the
roof
a
kind
of
dome
being
formed
of
large
flat
stones
overlapping
inwards
till
they
almost
meet
at
the
top
where
a
large
flat
stone
covers
all
in
each
of
the
three
recesses
of
the
cruciform
chamber
there
stands
a
large
stone
basin
or
rude
sarcophagus
but
not
traces
of
any
burial
now
remains
carvings
at
new
the
stones
are
all
raw
and
undressed
and
were
selected
for
their
purpose
from
the
and
elsewhere
close
by
on
their
flat
surfaces
obtained
by
splitting
slabs
from
the
original
quarries
are
found
the
carvings
which
form
the
unique
interest
of
this
strange
monument
except
for
the
large
stone
with
spiral
carvings
and
one
other
at
the
entrance
to
the
mound
the
intention
of
these
sculptures
does
not
appear
to
have
been
decorative
except
in
a
very
rude
and
primitive
sense
there
is
no
attempt
to
cover
a
given
surface
with
a
system
of
ornament
appropriate
to
its
size
and
shape
the
designs
are
as
it
were
scribbled
upon
the
walls
anyhow
and
anywhere
among
them
everywhere
the
spiral
is
prominent
the
resemblance
of
some
of
these
carvings
to
the
supposed
of
the
stones
at
gavr
inis
is
very
remarkable
triple
and
double
spiral
are
also
found
as
well
as
lozenges
and
zigzags
a
singular
carving
representing
what
looks
like
a
or
is
found
in
the
west
recess
the
drawing
of
this
object
is
naturalistic
and
it
is
hard
to
interpret
it
as
coffey
is
inclined
to
do
as
merely
a
piece
of
pattern
a
similar
design
but
with
the
ribs
arranged
at
right
angles
to
the
central
axis
is
found
in
the
neighbouring
tumulus
of
dowth
at
loughcrew
and
in
combination
with
a

as

goes
unusual
figure
is
found
sculptured
in
the

at

it
has
been
interpreted
by
various
critics
as
a
mason
s
mark
a
piece
of
phoenician
writing
a
group
of
numerals
and
finally
and
no
doubt
correctly
by
george
coffey
as
a
rude
representation
of
a
ship
with
men
on
board
and
uplifted
sail
it
is
noticeable
that
just
above
it
is
a
small
circle
forming
apparently
part
of
the
design

occurs
at

the
significance
of
this
marking
as
we
shall
see
is
possibly
very
great
it
has
been
discovered
that
on
certain
stones
in
the
tumulus
of
locmariaker
in
brittany
there
occur
a
number
of
very
similar
figures
one
of
them
showing
the
circle
in
much
the
same
relative
position
as
at
new
grange
the
axe
an
egyptian
hieroglyph
for
godhead
and
a
magical
emblem
is
also
represented
on
this
stone
again
in
a
brochure
by
oscar
montelius
on
the
of
sweden
we
find
a
reproduction
also
given
in
du
chaillu
s
viking
age
of
a
rude
showing
a
number
of
ships
with
men
on
board
and
the
circle
quartered
by
a
a
solar
above
one
of
them
that
these
ships
which
like
the
irish
example
are
often
so
summarily
represented
as
to
be
mere
symbols
which
no
one
could
identifiy
as
a
ship
were
the
clue
not
given
by
other
and
more
elaborate
representations
were
drawn
so
frequently
in
conjunction
with
the
solar
disk
merely
for
amusement
or
for
a
purely
decorative
object
seems
to
me
most
improbable
in
the
days
of
the
megalithic
folk
a
sepulchral
monument
the
very
focus
of
religious
ideas
would
hardly
have
been
covered
with
idle
and
meaningless
scrawls
man
as
sir
simpson
has
well
said
has
ever
conjoined
together
things
sacred
and
things
nor
do
these
scrawls
in
the
majority
of
instances
show
any
glimmering
of
a
decorative
intention
but
if
they
had
a
symbolic
intention
what
is
it
that
they
symbolise

symbol
in
now
this
symbol
of
the
ship
with
or
without
the
actual
portrayal
of
the
solar
emblem
is
of
very
ancient
and
very
common
occurrence
in
the
sepulchral
art
of
egypt
it
is
connected
with
the
worship
of
rā
which
came
in
fully
years
its
meaning
as
an
egyptian
symbol
is
well
known
the
ship
was
called
the
boat
of
the
sun
it
was
the
vessel
in
which
the
performed
his
journeys
in
particular
the
journey
which
he
made
nightly
to
the
shores
of
the
bearing
with
him
in
his
bark
the
souls
of
the
beatified
dead
the
rā
is
sometimes
represented
by
a
disk
sometimes
by
other
emblems
hovering
above
the
vessel
or
contained
within
it
any
one
who
will
look
over
the
painted
or
sculptured
sarcophagi
in
the
british
museum
will
find
a
host
of
examples
sometimes
he
will
find
representations
of
the
rays
of
rā
pouring
down
upon
the
boat
and
its
occupants
now
in
one
of
the
swedish
of

at
backa

given
by
montelius
a

crowded
with

shown

that

is
close
to

is
entirely
of
the

obviously

the

is
sometimes
represented
as
containing

sometimes
it
contains
the
figure
of

sometimes
it
contains
a

of
passengers
representing
human
souls
and
sometimes
the
figure

the
megalithic
carvings
also
sometimes
show
the
solar
emblem
and
sometimes
not
the
boats
are
sometimes
filled
with
figures
and
are
sometimes
empty
when
a
symbol
has
once
been
accepted
and
understood
any
conventional
or
summary
representation
of
it
is
sufficient
i
take
it
that
the
complete
form
of
the
megalithic
symbol
is
that
of
a
boat
with
figures
in
it
and
with
the
solar
emblem
overhead
these
figures
assuming
the
foregoing
interpretation
of
the
design
to
be
correct
must
clearly
be
taken
for
representations
of
the
dead
on
their
way
to
the
they
can
not
be
deities
for
representations
of
the
divine
powers
under
human
aspect
were
quite
unknown
to
the
megalithic
people
even
after
the
coming
of
the
first
occur
in
gaul
under
roman
influence
but
if
these
figures
represent
the
dead
then
we
have
clearly
before
us
the
origin
of
the
celtic
doctrine
of
immortality
the
carvings
in
question
are
they
are
found
where
no
celts
ever
penetrated
yet
they
point
to
the
existence
of
just
that
doctrine
which
from
the
time
of
cæsar
downwards
has
been
associated
with
celtic
druidism
and
this
doctrine
was

in
connexion
with
this
subject
i
may
draw
attention
to
the
theory
of
borlase
that
the
typical
design
of
an
irish
dolmen
was
intended
to
represent
a
ship
in
minorca
there
are
analogous
structures
there
popularly
called
ships
so
distinct
is
the
resemblance
but
he
adds
long
before
the
caves
and
of
minorca
were
known
to
me
i
had
formed
the
opinion
that
what
i
have
so
frequently
spoken
of
as
the
observable
so
universally
in
the
of
dolmens
was
due
to
an
original
conception
of
a
ship
from
sepulchral
tumuli
in
scandinavia
we
know
actual
vessels
have
on
several
occasions
been
disinterred
in
cemeteries
of
the
iron
age
in
the
same
country
as
well
as
on
the
more
southern
baltic
coasts
the
ship
was
a
recognised
form
of
sepulchral
if
borlase
s
view
is
correct
we
have
here
a
very
strong
corroboration
of
the
symbolic
intention
which
i
attribute
to
the
solar
of
the
megalithic
people
ship
symbol
in
the
ship
symbol
it
may
be
remarked
can
be
traced
to
about
in
babylonia
where
every
deity
had
his
own
special
ship
that
of
the
god
sin
was
called
the
ship
of
light
his
image
being
carried
in
procession
on
a
litter
formed
like
a
ship
this
is
thought
by
jastrow
to
have
originated
at
a
time
when
the
sacred
cities
of
babylonia
were
situated
on
the
persian
gulf
and
when
religious
processions
were
often
carried
out
by
water
symbol
of
the
yet
there
is
reason
to
think
that
some
of
these
symbols
were
earlier
than
any
known
mythology
and
were
so
to
say
mythologised
differently
by
different
peoples
who
got
hold
of
them
from
this
now
unknown
source
a
remarkable
instance
is
that
of
the
symbol
of
the
two
feet
in
egypt
the
feet
of
osiris
formed
one
of
the
portions
into
which
his
body
was
cut
up
in
the
myth
they
were
a
symbol
of
possession
or
of
visitation
i
have
come
upon
earth
says
the
book
of
the
dead
ch
xvii
and
with
my
two
feet
have
taken
possession
i
am
now
this
symbol
of
the
feet
or
footprint
is
very
widespread
it
is
found
in
india
as
the
print
of
the
foot
of
buddha
it
is
found
sculptured
on
dolmens
in
brittany
and
it
occurs
in
in
scandinavia
in
ireland
it
passes
for
the
footprints
of
patrick
or
columba
strangest
of
all
it
is
found
unmistakably
in
mexico
tyler
in
his
primitive
culture
ii
refers
to
the
aztec
ceremony
at
the
second
festival
of
the
sun
god
tezcatlipoca
when
they
sprinkled
maize
flour
before
his
sanctuary
and
his
high
priest
watched
till
he
beheld
the

footprints
and
then
shouted
to
announce
our
great
god
is
the
two
feet
symbol
the
two
feet
symbol
on
megalithic
there
is
very
strong
evidence
of
the
connexion
of
the
megalithic
people
with
north
africa
thus
as
sergi
points
out
many
signs
probably

on

in
the
cemetery
at

discovered
by

several
later
egyptian
hieroglyphic

including
the
famous
or
the
symbol
of
vitality
or
resurrection
are
also
found
in
megalithic
carvings
from
these
correspondences
letourneau
drew
the
conclusion
that
the
builders
of
our
megalithic
monuments
came
from
the
south
and
were
related
to
the
races
of
north
the

from
approaching
the

from

rhys

find
that
the
african
least
the
primitive
population
of
great
britain
and
ireland
is
strongly
suggested
it
is
here
shown
that
the
celtic
languages
preserve
in
their
syntax
the
hamitic
and
especially
the
egyptian
type
and
ideas
of
the
facts
at
present
known
do
not
i
think
justify
us
in
framing
any
theory
as
to
the
actual
historical
relation
of
the
of
western
europe
with
the
people
who
created
the
wonderful
religion
and
civilisation
of
ancient
egypt
but
when
we
consider
all
the
lines
of
evidence
that
converge
in
this
direction
it
seems
clear
that
there
was
such
a
relation
egypt
was
the
classic
land
of
religious
symbolism
it
gave
to
europe
the
most
beautiful
and
most
popular
of
all
its
religious
symbols
that
of
the
divine
mother
and
child
i
believe
that
it
also
gave
to
the
primitive
inhabitants
of
western
europe
the
profound
symbol
of
the
voyaging
spirits
guided
to
the
world
of
the
dead
by
the
god
of
light
the
religion
of
egypt
above
that
of
any
people
whose
ideas
we
know
to
have
been
developed
in
times
so
ancient
centred
on
the
doctrine
of
a
future
life
the
palatial
and
stupendous
tombs
the
elaborate
ritual
the
imposing
mythology
the
immense
exaltation
of
the
priestly
caste
all
these
features
of
egyptian
culture
were
intimately
connected
with
their
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
to
the
egyptian
the
disembodied
soul
was
no
shadowy
simulacrum
as
the
classical
nations
future
life
was
a
mere
prolongation
of
the
present
the
just
man
when
he
had
won
his
place
in
it
found
himself
among
his
relatives
his
friends
his
workpeople
with
tasks
and
enjoyments
very
much
like
those
of
earth
the
doom
of
the
wicked
was
annihilation
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
invisible
monster
called
the
eater
of
the
dead
now
when
the
classical
nations
first
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
ideas
of
the
celts
the
thing
that
principally
struck
them
was
the
celtic
belief
in
immortality
which
the
gauls
said
was
handed
down
by
the
the
classical
nations
believed
in
immortality
but
what
a
picture
does
homer
the
bible
of
the
greeks
give
of
the
lost
degraded
dehumanised
creatures
which
represented
the
departed
souls
of
men
take
as
one
example
the
description
of
the
spirits
of
the
suitors
slain
by
odysseus
as
hermes
conducts
them
to
the
underworld
now
were
summoned
the
souls
of
the
dead
by
cyllenian
hermes
touched
by
the
wand
they
awoke
and
obeyed
him
and
followed
him
squealing
even
as
bats
in
the
dark
mysterious
depths
of
a
cavern
squeal
as
they
flutter
around
should
one
from
the
cluster
be
fallen
where
from
the
rock
suspended
they
hung
all
clinging
together
so
did
the
souls
flock
squealing
behind
him
as
hermes
the
helper
guided
them
down
to
the
gloom
through
dank
and
mouldering
the
classical
writers
felt
rightly
that
the
celtic
idea
of
immortality
was
something
altogether
different
from
this
it
was
both
loftier
and
more
realistic
it
implied
a
true
persistence
of
the
living
man
as
he
was
at
present
in
all
his
human
relations
they
noted
with
surprise
that
the
celt
would
lend
money
on
a
promissory
note
for
repayment
in
the
next
world
that
is
an
absolutely
egyptian
conception
and
this
very
analogy
occurred
to
diodorus
in
writing
of
the
celtic
idea
of
was
like
nothing
that
he
knew
of
out
of
egypt
doctrine
of
many
ancient
writers
assert
that
the
celtic
idea
of
immortality
embodied
the
oriental
conception
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
and
to
account
for
this
the
hypothesis
was
invented
that
they
had
learned
the
doctrine
from
pythagoras
who
represented
it
in
classical
antiquity
thus
cæsar
the
principal
point
of
their
the
druids
teaching
is
that
the
soul
does
not
perish
and
that
after
death
it
passes
from
one
body
into
and
diodorus
among
them
the
doctrine
of
pythagoras
prevails
according
to
which
the
souls
of
men
are
immortal
and
after
a
fixed
term
recommence
to
live
taking
upon
themselves
a
new
now
traces
of
this
doctrine
certainly
do
appear
in
irish
legend
thus
the
irish
chieftain
mongan
who
is
an
historical
personage
and
whose
death
is
recorded
about
is
said
to
have
made
a
wager
as
to
the
place
of
death
of
a
king
named
fothad
slain
in
a
battle
with
the
mythical
hero
finn
mac
cumhal
in
the
third
century
he
proves
his
case
by
summoning
to
his
aid
a
from
the
keelta
who
was
the
actual
slayer
of
fothad
and
who
describes
correctly
where
the
tomb
is
to
be
found
and
what
were
its
contents
he
begins
his
tale
by
saying
to
mongan
we
were
with
thee
and
then
turning
to
the
assembly
he
continues
we
were
with
finn
coming
from
alba
hush
says
mongan
it
is
wrong
of
thee
to
reveal
a
the
secret
is
of
course
that
mongan
was
a
reincarnation
of
finn
but
the
evidence
on
the
whole
shows
that
the
celts
did
not
hold
this
doctrine
at
all
in
the
same
way
as
pythagoras
and
the
orientals
did
transmigration
was
not
with
them
part
of
the
order
of
things
it
happen
but
in
general
it
did
not
the
new
body
assumed
by
the
dead
clothed
them
in
another
not
in
this
world
and
so
far
as
we
can
learn
from
any
ancient
authority
there
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
idea
of
moral
retribution
connected
with
this
form
of
the
future
life
it
was
not
so
much
an
article
of
faith
as
an
idea
which
haunted
the
imagination
and
which
as
mongan
s
caution
indicates
ought
not
to
be
brought
into
clear
light
however
it
may
have
been
conceived
it
is
certain
that
the
belief
in
immortality
was
the
basis
of
celtic
druidism
caesar
affirms
this
distinctly
and
declares
the
doctrine
to
have
been
fostered
by
the
druids
rather
for
the
promotion
of
courage
than
for
purely
religious
reasons
an
intense
faith
such
as
that
held
by
the
celts
is
certainly
one
of
the
mightiest
of
agencies
in
the
hands
of
a
priesthood
who
hold
the
keys
of
that
world
now
druidism
existed
in
the
british
islands
in
gaul
and
in
fact
so
far
as
we
know
wherever
there
was
a
celtic
race
amid
a
population
of
there
were
celts
in
cisalpine
gaul
but
there
were
no
dolmens
there
and
there
were
no
druids
what
is
quite
clear
is
that
when
the
celts
got
to
western
europe
they
found
there
a
people
with
a
powerful
priesthood
a
ritual
and
imposing
religious
monuments
a
people
steeped
in
magic
and
mysticism
and
the
cult
of
the
underworld
the
inferences
as
i
read
the
facts
seem
to
be
that
druidism
in
its
essential
features
was
imposed
upon
the
imaginative
and
sensitive
nature
of
the
celt
with
his
extraordinary
aptitude
for
picking
up
the
earlier
population
of
western
europe
the
megalithic
people
while
as
held
by
these
it
stands
in
some
historical
relation
which
i
am
not
able
to
pursue
in
further
detail
with
the
religious
culture
of
ancient
egypt
much
obscurity
still
broods
over
the
question
and
perhaps
will
always
do
so
but
if
these
suggestions
have
anything
in
them
then
the
megalithic
people
have
been
brought
a
step
or
two
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
uncanny
mystery
which
has
surrounded
them
and
they
are
shown
to
have
played
a
very
important
part
in
the
religious
development
of
western
europe
and
in
preparing
that
part
of
the
world
for
the
rapid
extension
of
the
special
type
of
christianity
which
took
place
in
it
bertrand
in
his
most
interesting
chapter
on
l
irlande
celtique
points
out
that
very
soon
after
the
conversion
of
ireland
to
christianity
we
find
the
country
covered
with
monasteries
whose
complete
organisation
seems
to
indicate
that
they
were
really
druidic
colleges
transformed
cæsar
has
told
us
what
these
colleges
were
like
in
gaul
they
were
very
numerous
in
spite
of
the
severe
study
and
discipline
involved
crowds
flocked
into
them
for
the
sake
of
the
power
wielded
by
the
druidic
order
and
the
civil
immunities
which
its
members
of
all
grades
enjoyed
arts
and
sciences
were
studied
there
and
thousands
of
verses
enshrining
the
teachings
of
druidism
were
committed
to
memory
all
this
is
very
like
what
we
know
of
irish
druidism
such
an
organisation
would
pass
into
christianity
of
the
type
established
in
ireland
with
very
little
difficulty
the
belief
in
magical
rites
would
irish
christianity
as
its
copious
hagiography
plainly
shows
was
as
steeped
in
magical
ideas
as
ever
was
druidic
paganism
the
belief
in
immortality
would
remain
as
before
the
cardinal
doctrine
of
religion
above
all
the
supremacy
of
the
sacerdotal
order
over
the
temporal
power
would
remain
unimpaired
it
would
still
be
true
as
dion
chrysostom
said
of
the
druids
that
it
is
they
who
command
and
kings
on
thrones
of
gold
dwelling
in
splendid
palaces
are
but
their
ministers
and
the
servants
of
their
on
the
druidic
the
religious
philosophic
and
scientific
culture
superintended
by
the
druids
is
spoken
of
by
cæsar
with
much
respect
they
discuss
and
impart
to
the
youth
he
writes
many
things
respecting
the
stars
and
their
motions
respecting
the
extent
of
the
universe
and
of
our
earth
respecting
the
nature
of
things
respecting
the
power
and
the
majesty
of
the
immortal
gods
bk
vi
we
would
give
much
to
know
some
particulars
of
the
teaching
here
described
but
the
druids
though
well
acquainted
with
letters
strictly
forbade
the
committal
of
their
doctrines
to
writing
an
extremely
sagacious
provision
for
not
only
did
they
thus
surround
their
teaching
with
that
atmosphere
of
mystery
which
exercises
so
potent
a
spell
over
the
human
mind
but
they
ensured
that
it
could
never
be
effectively
controverted
sacrifices
in
in
strange
discord
however
with
the
lofty
words
of
cæsar
stands
the
abominable
practice
of
human
sacrifice
whose
prevalence
he
noted
among
the
celts
prisoners
and
criminals
or
if
these
failed
even
innocent
victims
probably
children
were
encased
numbers
at
a
time
in
huge
frames
of
wickerwork
and
there
burned
alive
to
win
the
favour
of
the
gods
the
practice
of
human
sacrifice
is
of
course
not
specially
is
found
in
all
parts
both
of
the
old
and
of
the
new
world
at
a
certain
stage
of
culture
and
was
doubtless
a
survival
from
the
time
of
the
megalithic
people
the
fact
that
it
should
have
continued
in
celtic
lands
after
an
otherwise
fairly
high
state
of
civilisation
and
religious
culture
had
been
attained
can
be
paralleled
from
mexico
and
carthage
and
in
both
cases
is
due
no
doubt
to
the
uncontrolled
dominance
of
a
priestly
caste
sacrifices
in
bertrand
endeavours
to
dissociate
the
druids
from
these
practices
of
which
he
says
strangely
there
is
no
trace
in
ireland
although
there
as
elsewhere
in
celtica
druidism
was
there
is
little
doubt
however
that
in
ireland
also
human
sacrifices
at
one
time
prevailed
in
a
very
ancient
tract
the
dinnsenchus
preserved
in
the
book
of
leinster
it
is
stated
that
on
moyslaught
the
plain
of
adoration
there
stood
a
great
gold
idol
crom
cruach
the
bloody
crescent
to
it
the
gaels
used
to
sacrifice
children
when
praying
for
fair
weather
and
it
was
milk
and
corn
they
asked
from
it
in
exchange
for
their
great
was
their
horror
and
their
moaning
in
in
egypt
where
the
national
character
was
markedly
and
little
capable
of
fanatical
exaltation
we
find
no
record
of
any
such
cruel
rites
in
the
monumental
inscriptions
and
paintings
copious
as
is
the
information
which
they
give
us
on
all
features
of
the
national
life
and
religion
manetho
indeed
the
egyptian
historian
who
wrote
in
the
third
century
tells
us
that
human
sacrifices
were
abolished
by
amasis
so
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
xviii
but
the
complete
silence
of
the
other
records
shows
us
that
even
if
we
are
to
believe
manetho
the
practice
must
in
historic
times
have
been
very
rare
and
must
have
been
looked
on
with
repugnance
names
of
celtic
what
were
the
names
and
the
attributes
of
the
celtic
deities
here
we
are
very
much
in
the
dark
the
megalithic
people
did
not
imagine
their
deities
under
concrete
personal
form
stones
rivers
wells
trees
and
other
natural
objects
were
to
them
the
adequate
symbols
or
were
half
symbols
half
actual
embodiments
of
the
supernatural
forces
which
they
venerated
but
the
imaginative
mind
of
the
aryan
celt
was
not
content
with
this
the
existence
of
personal
gods
with
distinct
titles
and
attributes
is
reported
to
us
by
caesar
who
equates
them
with
various
figures
in
the
roman
apollo
mars
and
so
forth
lucan
mentions
a
triad
of
deities
æsus
teutates
and
taranus
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
in
these
names
we
seem
to
be
in
presence
of
a
true
celtic
aryan
tradition
thus
æsus
is
derived
by
belloguet
from
the
aryan
root
meaning
to
be
which
furnished
the
name
of
esprit
to
the
persians
æsun
to
the
umbrians
asa
divine
being
to
the
scandinavians
teutates
comes
from
a
celtic
root
meaning
valiant
warlike
and
indicates
a
deity
equivalent
to
mars
taranus
thor
according
to
de
jubainville
is
a
god
of
the
lightning
in
welsh
cornish
and
breton
is
the
word
for
thunderbolt
votive
inscriptions
to
these
gods
have
been
found
in
gaul
and
britain
other
inscriptions
and
sculptures
bear
testimony
to
the
existence
in
gaul
of
a
host
of
minor
and
local
deities
who
are
mostly
mere
names
or
not
even
names
to
us
now
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
them
these
conceptions
bear
clear
traces
of
roman
influence
the
sculptures
are
rude
copies
of
the
roman
style
of
religious
art
but
we
meet
among
them
figures
of
much
wilder
and
stranger
with
triple
faces
gods
with
branching
antlers
on
their
brows
serpents
and
other
now
unintelligible
symbols
of
the
older
faith
very
notable
is
the
frequent
occurrence
of
the
buddha
attitude
so
prevalent
in
the
religious
art
of
the
east
and
of
mexico
and
also
the
tendency
so
well
known
in
egypt
to
group
the
gods
in
triads
on
the
celtic
caesar
who
tries
to
fit
the
gallic
religion
into
the
framework
of
roman
was
exactly
what
the
gauls
themselves
did
after
the
they
held
mercury
to
be
the
chief
of
the
gods
and
looked
upon
him
as
the
inventor
of
all
the
arts
as
the
presiding
deity
of
commerce
and
as
the
guardian
of
roads
and
guide
of
travellers
one
may
conjecture
that
he
was
particularly
to
the
gauls
as
to
the
romans
the
guide
of
the
dead
of
travellers
to
the
many
bronze
statues
to
mercury
of
gaulish
origin
still
remain
the
name
being
adopted
by
the
gauls
as
many
still
testify
apollo
was
regarded
as
the
deity
of
medicine
and
healing
minerva
was
the
initiator
of
arts
and
crafts
jupiter
governed
the
sky
and
mars
presided
over
war
cæsar
is
here
no
doubt
classifying
under
five
types
and
by
roman
names
a
large
number
of
gallic
divinities
god
of
the
according
to
cæsar
a
most
notable
deity
of
the
gauls
was
in
roman
nomenclature
dis
or
pluto
the
god
of
the
underworld
inhabited
by
the
dead
from
him
all
the
gauls
claimed
to
be
descended
and
on
this
account
says
cæsar
they
began
their
reckoning
of
the
hours
of
the
day
with
the
oncoming
of
night
the
name
of
this
deity
is
not
given
d
arbois
de
jubainville
considers
that
together
with
æsus
teutates
taranus
and
in
irish
mythology
balor
and
the
fomorians
he
represents
the
powers
of
darkness
death
and
evil
and
celtic
mythology
is
thus
interpreted
as
a
variant
of
the
universal
solar
myth
embodying
the
conception
of
the
eternal
conflict
between
day
and
night
god
of
the
god
of
light
appears
in
gaul
and
in
ireland
as
lugh
or
lugus
who
has
left
his
traces
in
many
such
as
leyden
lyons
lugh
appears
in
irish
legend
with
distinctly
solar
attributes
when
he
meets
his
army
before
the
great
conflict
with
the
fomorians
they
feel
says
the
saga
as
if
they

the
rising
of
the
sun
yet
he
is
also
as
we
shall
see
a
god
of
the
underworld
belonging
on
the
side
of
his
mother
ethlinn
daughter
of
balor
to
the
powers
of
darkness
celtic
conception
of
the
fact
is
that
the
celtic
conception
of
the
realm
of
death
differed
altogether
from
that
of
the
greeks
and
romans
and
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
resembled
that
of
egyptian
religion
the
was
not
a
place
of
gloom
and
suffering
but
of
light
and
liberation
the
sun
was
as
much
the
god
of
that
world
as
he
was
or
this
evil
pain
and
gloom
there
were
no
doubt
and
no
doubt
these
principles
were
embodied
by
the
irish
celts
in
their
myths
of
balor
and
the
fomorians
of
which
we
shall
hear
anon
but
that
they
were
particularly
associated
with
the
idea
of
death
is
i
think
a
false
supposition
founded
on
misleading
analogies
drawn
from
the
ideas
of
the
classical
nations
here
the
celts
followed
north
african
or
asiatic
conceptions
rather
than
those
of
the
aryans
of
europe
it
is
only
by
realising
that
the
celts
as
we
know
them
in
history
from
the
of
the
celtic
empire
onwards
formed
a
singular
blend
of
aryan
with
characteristics
that
we
shall
arrive
at
a
true
understanding
of
their
contribution
to
european
history
and
their
influence
in
european
culture
five
factors
in
ancient
celtic
to
sum
up
the
conclusions
indicated
we
can
i
think
distinguish
five
distinct
factors
in
the
religious
and
intellectual
culture
of
celtic
lands
as
we
find
them
prior
to
the
influx
of
classical
or
of
christian
influences
first
we
have
before
us
a
mass
of
popular
superstitions
and
of
magical
observances
including
human
sacrifice
these
varied
more
or
less
from
place
to
place
centring
as
they
did
largely
on
local
features
which
were
regarded
as
embodiments
or
vehicles
of
divine
or
of
diabolic
power
secondly
there
was
certainly
in
existence
a
thoughtful
and
philosophic
creed
having
as
its
central
object
of
worship
the
sun
as
an
emblem
of
divine
power
and
constancy
and
as
its
central
doctrine
the
immortality
of
the
soul
thirdly
there
was
a
worship
of
personified
deities
æsus
teutates
lugh
and
others
conceived
as
representing
natural
forces
or
as
guardians
of
social
laws
fourthly
the
romans
were
deeply
impressed
with
the
existence
among
the
druids
of
a
body
of
teaching
of
a
nature
about
natural
phenomena
and
the
constitution
of
the
universe
of
the
details
of
which
we
unfortunately
know
practically
nothing
lastly
we
have
to
note
the
prevalence
of
a
sacerdotal
organisation
which
administered
the
whole
system
of
religious
and
of
secular
learning
and
literature
which
carefully
confined
this
learning
to
a
privileged
caste
and
which
by
virtue
of
its
intellectual
supremacy
and
of
the
atmosphere
of
religious
awe
with
which
it
was
surrounded
became
the
sovran
power
social
political
and
religious
in
every
celtic
country
i
have
spoken
of
these
elements
as
distinct
and
we
can
indeed
distinguish
them
in
thought
but
in
practice
they
were
inextricably
intertwined
and
the
druidic
organisation
pervaded
and
ordered
all
can
we
now
it
may
be
asked
distinguish
among
them
what
is
of
celtic
and
what
of
and
probably
origin
this
is
a
more
difficult
task
yet
looking
at
all
the
analogies
and
probabilities
i
think
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
in
assigning
to
the
megalithic
people
the
special
doctrines
the
ritual
and
the
sacerdotal
organisation
of
druidism
and
to
the
celtic
element
the
personified
deities
with
the
zest
for
learning
and
for
speculation
while
the
popular
superstitions
were
merely
the
local
form
assumed
by
conceptions
as
widespread
as
the
human
race
celts
of
in
view
of
the
undeniably
mixed
character
of
the
populations
called
celtic
at
the
present
day
it
is
often
urged
that
this
designation
has
no
real
relation
to
any
ethnological
fact
the
celts
who
fought
with
caesar
in
gaul
and
with
the
english
in
ireland
are
it
is
said
no
have
perished
on
a
thousand
battlefields
from
alesia
to
the
boyne
and
an
older
racial
stratum
has
come
to
the
surface
in
their
place
the
true
celts
according
to
this
view
are
only
to
be
found
in
the
tall
ruddy
highlanders
of
perthshire
and
scotland
and
in
a
few
families
of
the
old
ruling
race
still
surviving
in
ireland
and
in
wales
in
all
this
i
think
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
a
large
measure
of
truth
yet
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
descendants
of
the
megalithic
people
at
the
present
day
are
on
the
physical
side
deeply
impregnated
with
celtic
blood
and
on
the
spiritual
with
celtic
traditions
and
ideals
nor
again
in
discussing
these
questions
of
and
its
origin
must
it
ever
be
assumed
that
the
character
of
a
people
can
be
analysed
as
one
analyses
a
chemical
compound
fixing
once
for
all
its
constituent
parts
and
determining
its
future
behaviour
and
destiny
potent
and
enduring
though
it
be
is
not
a
dead
thing
cast
in
an
iron
mould
and
thereafter
incapable
of
change
and
growth
it
is
part
of
the
living
forces
of
the
world
it
is
plastic
and
vital
it
has
hidden
potencies
which
a
variety
of
causes
such
as
a
felicitous
cross
with
a
different
but
not
too
different
stock
another
adoption
of
a
new
religious
or
social
ideal
may
at
any
time
unlock
and
bring
into
action
of
one
thing
i
personally
feel
the
problem
of
the
ethical
social
and
intellectual
development
of
the
people
constituting
what
is
called
the
celtic
fringe
in
europe
ought
to
be
worked
for
on
celtic
lines
by
the
maintenance
of
the
celtic
tradition
celtic
literature
celtic
encouragement
in
short
of
all
those
celtic
affinities
of
which
this
mixed
race
is
now
the
sole
conscious
inheritor
and
guardian
to
these
it
will
respond
by
these
it
can
be
deeply
moved
nor
has
the
harvest
ever
failed
those
who
with
courage
and
faith
have
driven
their
plough
into
this
rich
field
on
the
other
hand
if
this
work
is
to
be
done
with
success
it
must
be
done
in
no
pedantic
narrow
intolerant
spirit
there
must
be
no
clinging
to
the
outward
forms
of
the
past
simply
because
the
celtic
spirit
once
found
utterance
in
them
let
it
be
remembered
that
in
the
early
middle
ages
celts
from
ireland
were
the
most
notable
explorers
the
most
notable
pioneers
of
religion
science
and
speculative
thought
in
europe
modern
investigators
have
traced
their
footprints
of
light
over
half
the
heathen
continent
and
the
schools
of
ireland
were
thronged
with
foreign
pupils
who
could
get
learning
nowhere
else
the
celtic
spirit
was
then
playing
its
true
part
in
the
and
a
greater
it
has
never
played
the
legacy
of
these
men
should
be
cherished
indeed
but
not
as
a
museum
curiosity
nothing
could
be
more
opposed
to
their
free
bold
adventurous
spirit
than
to
let
that
legacy
petrify
in
the
hands
of
those
who
claim
the
heirship
or
their
name
and
fame
mythical
after
the
sketch
contained
in
this
and
the
foregoing
chapter
of
the
early
history
of
the
celts
and
of
the
forces
which
have
moulded
it
we
shall
now
turn
to
give
an
account
of
the
mythical
and
legendary
literature
in
which
their
spirit
most
truly
lives
and
shines
we
shall
not
here
concern
ourselves
with
any
literature
which
is
not
celtic
with
all
that
other
peoples
have
in
the
arthurian
myths
and
tales
originally
celtic
we
have
here
nothing
to
do
no
one
can
now
tell
how
much
is
celtic
in
them
and
how
much
is
not
and
in
matters
of
this
kind
it
is
generally
the
final
recasting
that
is
of
real
importance
and
value
whatever
we
give
then
we
give
without
addition
or
reshaping
stories
of
course
have
often
to
be
summarised
but
there
shall
be
nothing
in
them
that
did
not
come
direct
from
the
celtic
mind
and
that
does
not
exist
in
some
variety
gaelic
or
cymric
of
the
celtic
tongue
chapter
iii
the
irish
invasion
myths
celtic
among
those
secret
doctrines
about
the
nature
of
things
which
as
cæsar
tells
us
the
druids
never
would
commit
to
writing
was
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
cosmogony
any
account
of
the
origin
of
the
world
and
of
man
there
surely
was
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
alone
among
the
races
of
the
world
the
celts
had
no
the
spectacle
of
the
universe
with
all
its
vast
and
mysterious
phenomena
in
heaven
and
on
earth
has
aroused
first
the
imagination
afterwards
the
speculative
reason
in
every
people
which
is
capable
of
either
the
celts
had
both
in
abundance
yet
except
for
that
one
phrase
about
the
indestructibility
of
the
world
handed
down
to
us
by
strabo
we
know
nothing
of
their
early
imaginings
or
their
reasonings
on
this
subject
ireland
possesses
a
copious
legendary
literature
all
of
this
no
doubt
assumed
its
present
form
in
christian
times
yet
so
much
essential
paganism
has
been
allowed
to
remain
in
it
that
it
would
be
strange
if
christian
influences
had
led
to
the
excision
of
everything
in
these
ancient
texts
that
pointed
to
a
conception
of
the
origin
of
christian
editors
and
transmitters
had
never
given
us
even
the
least
glimmer
of
the
existence
of
such
a
conception
yet
the
fact
is
that
they
do
not
give
it
there
is
nothing
in
the
most
ancient
legendary
literature
of
the
irish
gaels
which
is
the
oldest
celtic
literature
in
existence
corresponding
to
the
babylonian
conquest
of
chaos
or
the
wild
norse
myth
of
the
making
of
midgard
out
of
the
corpse
of
ymir
or
the
egyptian
creation
of
the
universe
out
of
the
primeval
water
by
thoth
the
word
of
god
or
even
to
the
primitive
folklore
conceptions
found
in
almost
every
savage
tribe
that
the
druids
had
some
doctrine
on
this
subject
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
but
by
resolutely
confining
it
to
the
initiated
and
forbidding
all
lay
speculation
on
the
subject
they
seem
to
have
completely
stifled
the
mythmaking
instinct
in
regard
to
questions
of
cosmogony
among
the
people
at
large
and
ensured
that
when
their
own
order
perished
their
teaching
whatever
it
was
should
die
with
them
in
the
early
irish
accounts
therefore
of
the
beginnings
of
things
we
find
that
it
is
not
with
the
world
that
the
narrators
make
their
is
simply
with
their
own
country
with
ireland
it
was
the
practice
indeed
to
prefix
to
these
narratives
of
early
invasions
and
colonisations
the
scriptural
account
of
the
making
of
the
world
and
man
and
this
shows
that
something
of
the
kind
was
felt
to
be
required
but
what
took
the
place
of
the
biblical
narrative
in
days
we
do
not
know
and
unfortunately
are
now
never
likely
to
know
cycles
of
irish
irish
mythical
and
legendary
literature
as
we
have
it
in
the
most
ancient
form
may
be
said
to
fall
into
four
main
divisions
and
to
these
we
shall
adhere
in
our
presentation
of
it
in
this
volume
they
are
in
chronological
order
the
mythological
cycle
or
cycle
of
the
invasions
the
ultonian
or
conorian
cycle
the
ossianic
or
fenian
cycle
and
a
multitude
of
miscellaneous
tales
and
legends
which
it
is
hard
to
fit
into
any
historical
framework
mythological
the
mythological
cycle
comprises
the
following
sections
the
coming
of
partholan
into
ireland
the
coming
of
nemed
into
ireland
the
coming
of
the
firbolgs
into
ireland
the
invasion
of
the
de
or
people
of
the
god
dana
the
invasion
of
the
milesians
sons
of
miled
from
spain
and
their
conquest
of
the
people
of
dana
with
the
milesians
we
begin
to
come
into
something
resembling
represent
in
irish
legend
the
celtic
race
and
from
them
the
ruling
families
of
ireland
are
supposed
to
be
descended
the
people
of
dana
are
evidently
gods
the
settlers
or
invaders
are
huge
figures
which
loom
vaguely
through
the
mists
of
tradition
and
have
little
definite
characterisation
the
accounts
which
are
given
of
them
are
many
and
conflicting
and
out
of
these
we
can
only
give
here
the
more
ancient
narratives
coming
of
the
celts
as
we
have
learned
from
caesar
believed
themselves
to
be
descended
from
the
god
of
the
underworld
the
god
of
the
dead
partholan
is
said
to
have
come
into
ireland
from
the
west
where
beyond
the
vast
unsailed
atlantic
ocean
the
irish
fairyland
the
land
of
the
the
land
of
the
happy
was
placed
his
father
s
name
was
sera
the
west
he
came
with
his
queen
dalny
and
a
number
of
companions
of
both
sexes
this
is
an
imaginative
touch
intended
to
suggest
extreme
then
a
different
country
physically
from
what
it
is
now
there
were
then
but
three
lakes
in
ireland
nine
rivers
and
only
one
plain
others
were
added
gradually
during
the
reign
of
the
partholanians
one
lake
rury
was
said
to
have
burst
out
as
a
grave
was
being
dug
for
rury
son
of
partholan
the
partholanians
it
is
said
had
to
do
battle
with
a
strange
race
called
the
fomorians
of
whom
we
shall
hear
much
in
later
sections
of
this
book
they
were
a
huge
misshapen
violent
and
cruel
people
representing
we
may
believe
the
powers
of
evil
one
of
these
was
surnamed
which
means
the
footless
and
thus
appears
to
be
related
to
vitra
the
god
of
evil
in
vedantic
mythology
who
had
neither
feet
nor
hands
with
a
host
of
these
demons
partholan
fought
for
the
lordship
of
ireland
and
drove
them
out
to
the
northern
seas
whence
they
occasionally
harried
the
country
under
its
later
rulers
the
end
of
the
race
of
partholan
was
that
they
were
afflicted
by
pestilence
and
having
gathered
together
on
the
old
plain
senmag
for
convenience
of
burying
their
dead
they
all
perished
there
and
ireland
once
more
lay
empty
for
reoccupation
legend
of
tuan
mac
who
then
told
the
tale
this
brings
us
to
the
mention
of
a
very
curious
and
interesting
of
the
numerous
legendary
narratives
in
which
these
tales
of
the
mythical
period
have
come
down
to
us
it
is
found
in
the
book
of
the
dun
cow
a
manuscript
of
about
the
year
and
is
entitled
the
legend
of
tuan
mac
finnen
an
irish
abbot
of
the
sixth
century
is
said
to
have
gone
to
seek
hospitality
from
a
chief
named
tuan
mac
carell
who
dwelt
not
far
from
finnen
s
monastery
at
moville
donegal
tuan
refused
him
admittance
the
saint
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
of
the
chief
and
fasted
for
a
whole
sunday
upon
which
the
surly
pagan
warrior
opened
the
door
to
him
good
relations
were
established
between
them
and
the
saint
returned
to
his
monks
tuan
is
an
excellent
man
said
he
to
them
he
will
come
to
you
and
comfort
you
and
tell
you
the
old
stories
of
this
humane
interest
in
the
old
myths
and
legends
of
the
country
is
it
may
here
be
observed
a
feature
as
constant
as
it
is
pleasant
in
the
literature
of
early
irish
christianity
tuan
came
shortly
afterwards
to
return
the
visit
of
the
saint
and
invited
him
and
his
disciples
to
his
fortress
they
asked
him
of
his
name
and
lineage
and
he
gave
an
astounding
reply
i
am
a
man
of
ulster
he
said
my
name
is
tuan
son
of
carell
but
once
i
was
called
tuan
son
of
starn
son
of
sera
and
my
father
starn
was
the
brother
of
tell
us
the
history
of
ireland
then
said
finnen
and
tuan
began
partholan
he
said
was
the
first
of
men
to
settle
in
ireland
after
the
great
pestilence
already
narrated
he
alone
survived
for
there
is
never
a
slaughter
that
one
man
does
not
come
out
of
it
to
tell
the
tuan
was
alone
in
the
land
and
he
wandered
about
from
one
vacant
fortress
to
another
from
rock
to
rock
seeking
shelter
from
the
wolves
for
years
he
lived
thus
alone
dwelling
in
waste
places
till
at
last
he
fell
into
extreme
decrepitude
and
old
age
then
nemed
son
of
agnoman
took
possession
of
ireland
he
agnoman
was

father

brother
i
saw
him
from
the
cliffs
and
kept
avoiding
him
i
was
clawed
decrepit
grey
naked
wretched
miserable
then
one
evening
i
fell
asleep
and
when
i
woke
again
on
the
morrow
i
was
changed
into
a
stag
i
was
young
again
and
glad
of
heart
then
i
sang
of
the
coming
of
nemed
and
of
his
race
and
of
my
own
transformation
i
have
put
on
a
new
form
a
skin
rough
and
grey
victory
and
joy
are
easy
to
me
a
little
while
ago
i
was
weak
and
tuan
is
then
king
of
all
the
deer
of
ireland
and
so
remained
all
the
days
of
nemed
and
his
race
he
tells
how
the
nemedians
sailed
for
ireland
in
a
fleet
of
barks
in
each
bark
thirty
persons
they
went
astray
on
the
seas
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
most
of
them
perished
of
hunger
and
thirst
or
of
shipwreck
nine
only
himself
with
four
men
and
four
women
these
landed
in
ireland
and
increased
their
numbers
in
the
course
of
time
till
they
were
men
and
women
then
all
of
them
mysteriously
died
again
old
age
and
decrepitude
fell
upon
tuan
but
another
transformation
awaited
him
once
i
was
standing
at
the
mouth
of
my
still
remember
it
i
knew
that
my
body
changed
into
another
form
i
was
a
wild
boar
and
i
sang
this
song
about
it
i
am
a
boar
time
was
when
i
sat
in
the
assembly
that
gave
the
judgments
of
partholan
it
was
sung
and
all
praised
the
melody
how
pleasant
was
the
strain
of
my
brilliant
judgment
how
pleasant
to
the
comely
young
women
my
chariot
went
along
in
majesty
and
beauty
my
voice
was
grave
and
sweet
my
step
was
swift
and
firm
in
battle
my
face
was
full
of
charm
lo
i
am
changed
into
a
black
that
is
what
i
said
yea
of
a
surety
i
was
a
wild
boar
then
i
became
young
again
and
i
was
glad
i
was
king
of
the
in
ireland
and
faithful
to
any
custom
i
went
the
rounds
of
my
abode
when
i
returned
into
the
lands
of
ulster
at
the
times
old
age
and
wretchedness
came
upon
me
for
it
was
always
there
that
my
transformations
took
place
and
that
is
why
i
went
back
thither
to
await
the
renewal
of
my
tuan
then
goes
on
to
tell
how
semion
son
of
stariat
settled
in
ireland
from
whom
descended
the
firbolgs
and
two
other
tribes
who
persisted
into
historic
times
again
old
age
comes
on
his
strength
fails
him
and
he
undergoes
another
transformation
he
becomes
a
great
eagle
of
the
sea
and
once
more
rejoices
in
renewed
youth
and
vigour
he
then
tells
how
the
people
of
dana
came
in
gods
and
false
gods
from
whom
every
one
knows
the
irish
men
of
learning
are
after
these
came
the
sons
of
miled
who
conquered
the
people
of
dana
all
this
time
tuan
kept
the
shape
of
the
till
one
day
finding
himself
about
to
undergo
another
transformation
he
fasted
nine
days
then
sleep
fell
upon
me
and
i
was
changed
into
a
he
rejoices
in
his
new
life
escaping
for
many
years
the
snares
of
the
fishermen
till
at
last
he
is
captured
by
one
of
them
and
brought
to
the
wife
of
carell
chief
of
the
country
the
woman
desired
me
and
ate
me
by
herself
whole
so
that
i
passed
into
her
he
is
born
again
and
passes
for
tuan
son
of
carell
but
the
memory
of
his
and
all
his
transformations
and
all
the
history
of
ireland
that
he
witnessed
since
the
days
of
partholan
still
abides
with
him
and
he
teaches
all
these
things
to
the
christian
monks
who
carefully
preserve
them
this
wild
tale
with
its
atmosphere
of
grey
antiquity
and
of
childlike
wonder
reminds
us
of
the
transformations
of
the
welsh
taliessin
who
also
became
an
eagle
and
points
to
that
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
the
soul
which
as
we
have
seen
haunted
the
imagination
of
the
celt
we
have
now
to
add
some
details
to
the
sketch
of
the
successive
colonisations
of
ireland
outlined
by
tuan
mac
carell
the
nemedians
as
we
have
seen
were
akin
to
the
partholanians
both
of
them
came
from
the
mysterious
regions
of
the
dead
though
later
irish
accounts
which
endeavoured
to
reconcile
this
mythical
matter
with
christianity
invented
for
them
a
descent
from
scriptural
patriarchs
and
an
origin
in
earthly
lands
such
as
spain
or
scythia
both
of
them
had
to
do
constant
battle
with
the
fomorians
whom
the
later
legends
make
out
to
be
pirates
from
oversea
but
who
are
doubtless
divinities
representing
the
powers
of
darkness
and
evil
there
is
no
legend
of
the
fomorians
coming
into
ireland
nor
were
they
regarded
as
at
any
time
a
regular
portion
of
the
population
they
were
coeval
with
the
world
itself
nemed
fought
victoriously
against
them
in
four
great
battles
but
shortly
afterwards
died
of
a
plague
which
carried
off
of
his
people
with
him
the
fomorians
were
then
enabled
to
establish
their
tyranny
over
ireland
they
had
at
this
period
two
kings
morc
and
conann
the
stronghold
of
the
formorian
power
was
on
tory
island
which
uplifts
its
wild
cliffs
and
precipices
in
the
atlantic
off
the
coast
of
fit
home
for
this
race
of
mystery
and
horror
they
extracted
a
crushing
tribute
from
the
people
of
ireland
of
all
the
milk
and
of
the
children
of
the
land
at
last
the
nemedians
rise
in
revolt
led
by
three
chiefs
they
land
on
tory
island
capture
conann
s
tower
and
conann
himself
falls
by
the
hand
of
the
nemedian
chief
fergus
but
morc
at
this
moment
comes
into
the
battle
with
a
fresh
host
and
utterly
routs
the
nemedians
who
are
all
slain
but
thirty
the
men
of
erin
were
all
at
the
battle
after
the
fomorians
came
all
of
them
the
sea
engulphed
save
only
three
times
by
eochy
o
flann
the
thirty
survivors
leave
ireland
in
despair
according
to
the
most
ancient
belief
they
perished
utterly
leaving
no
descendants
but
later
accounts
which
endeavour
to
make
sober
history
out
of
all
these
myths
represent
one
family
that
of
the
chief
britan
as
settling
in
great
britain
and
giving
their
name
to
that
country
while
two
others
returned
to
ireland
after
many
wanderings
as
the
firbolgs
and
people
of
dana
coming
of
the
who
were
the
firbolgs
and
what
did
they
represent
in
irish
legend
the
name
appears
to
mean
men
of
the
bags
and
a
legend
was
in
later
times
invented
to
account
for
it
it
was
said
that
after
settling
in
greece
they
were
oppressed
by
the
people
of
that
country
who
set
them
to
carry
earth
from
the
fertile
valleys
up
to
the
rocky
hills
so
as
to
make
arable
ground
of
the
latter
they
did
their
task
by
means
of
leathern
bags
but
at
last
growing
weary
of
the
oppression
they
made
boats
or
coracles
out
of
their
bags
and
set
sail
in
them
for
ireland
nennius
however
says
they
came
from
spain
for
according
to
him
all
the
various
races
that
inhabited
ireland
came
originally
from
spain
and
spain
with
him
is
a
rationalistic
rendering
of
the
celtic
words
designating
the
land
of
the
dead
they
came
in
three
groups
the
the
and
the
galioin
who
are
all
generally
designated
as
firbolgs
they
play
no
great
part
in
irish
mythical
history
and
a
certain
character
of
servility
and
inferiority
appears
to
attach
to
them
throughout
one
of
their
kings
eochy
mac
erc
took
in
marriage
taltiu
or
telta
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
great
plain
the
land
of
the
dead
telta
had
a
palace
at
the
place
now
called
after
her
telltown
properly
teltin
there
she
died
and
there
even
in
mediæval
ireland
a
great
annual
assembly
or
fair
was
held
in
her
honour
coming
of
the
people
of
we
now
come
to
by
far
the
most
interesting
and
important
of
the
mythical
invaders
and
colonisers
of
ireland
the
people
of
dana
the
name
de
means
literally
the
folk
of
the
god
whose
mother
is
dana
also
sometimes
bears
another
name
that
of
brigit
a
goddess
held
in
much
honour
by
pagan
ireland
whose
attributes
are
in
a
great
measure
transferred
in
legend
to
the
christian
brigit
of
the
sixth
century
her
name
is
also
found
in
gaulish
inscriptions
as
brigindo
and
occurs
in
several
british
inscriptions
as
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
supreme
head
of
the
people
of
dana
the
god
dagda
the
she
had
three
sons
who
are
said
to
have
had
in
common
one
only
son
named
is
to
say
knowledge
or
ecne
then
may
be
said
to
be
the
god
whose
mother
was
dana
and
the
race
to
whom
she
gave
her
name
are
the
clearest
representatives
we
have
in
irish
myths
of
the
powers
of
light
and
knowledge
it
will
be
remembered
that
alone
among
all
these
mythical
races
tuan
mac
carell
gave
to
the
people
of
dana
the
name
of
yet
it
is
not
as
gods
that
they
appear
in
the
form
in
which
irish
legends
about
them
have
now
come
down
to
us
christian
influences
reduced
them
to
the
rank
of
fairies
or
identified
them
with
the
fallen
angels
they
were
conquered
by
the
milesians
who
are
conceived
as
an
entirely
human
race
and
who
had
all
sorts
of
relations
of
love
and
war
with
them
until
quite
recent
times
yet
even
in
the
later
legends
a
certain
splendour
and
exaltation
appears
to
invest
the
people
of
dana
recalling
the
high
estate
from
which
they
had
been
dethroned
popular
and
the
bardic
nor
must
it
be
overlooked
that
the
popular
conception
of
the
danaan
deities
was
probably
at
all
times
something
different
from
the
bardic
and
druidic
or
in
other
words
the
scholarly
conception
the
latter
as
we
shall
see
represents
them
as
the
presiding
deities
of
science
and
poetry
this
is
not
a
popular
idea
it
is
the
product
of
the
celtic
the
aryan
imagination
inspired
by
a
strictly
intellectual
conception
the
common
people
who
represented
mainly
the
megalithic
element
in
the
population
appear
to
have
conceived
their
deities
as
as
they
are
explicitly
called
in
the
book
of
armagh
not
over
science
and
poetry
but
rather
agriculture
controlling
the
fecundity
of
the
earth
and
water
and
dwelling
in
hills
rivers
and
lakes
in
the
bardic
literature
the
aryan
idea
is
prominent
the
other
is
to
be
found
in
innumerable
and
popular
observances
but
of
course
in
each
case
a
considerable
amount
of
interpenetration
of
the
two
conceptions
is
to
be
met
sharp
dividing
line
was
drawn
between
them
in
ancient
times
and
none
can
be
drawn
now
treasures
of
the
tuan
mac
carell
says
they
came
to
ireland
out
of
this
is
embroidered
in
later
tradition
into
a
narrative
telling
how
they
sprang
from
four
great
cities
whose
very
names
breathe
of
fairydom
and
gorias
finias
and
murias
here
they
learned
science
and
craftsmanship
from
great
sages
one
of
whom
was
enthroned
in
each
city
and
from
each
they
brought
with
them
a
magical
treasure
from
falias
came
the
stone
called
the
or
stone
of
destiny
on
which
the
of
ireland
stood
when
they
were
crowned
and
which
was
supposed
to
confirm
the
election
of
a
rightful
monarch
by
roaring
under
him
as
he
took
his
place
on
it
the
actual
stone
which
was
so
used
at
the
inauguration
of
a
reign
did
from
immemorial
times
exist
at
tara
and
was
sent
thence
to
scotland
early
in
the
sixth
century
for
the
crowning
of
fergus
the
great
son
of
erc
who
begged
his
brother
murtagh
mac
erc
king
of
ireland
for
the
loan
of
it
an
ancient
prophecy
told
that
wherever
this
stone
was
a
king
of
the
scotic
race
should
reign
this
is
the
famous
stone
of
scone
which
never
came
back
to
ireland
but
was
removed
to
england
by
edward
in
and
is
now
the
coronation
stone
in
westminster
abbey
nor
has
the
old
prophecy
been
falsified
since
through
the
stuarts
and
fergus
mac
erc
the
descent
of
the
british
royal
family
can
be
traced
from
the
historic
kings
of
milesian
ireland
the
second
treasure
of
the
danaans
was
the
invincible
sword
of
lugh
of
the
long
arm
of
whom
we
shall
hear
later
and
this
sword
came
from
the
city
of
gorias
from
finias
came
a
magic
spear
and
from
murias
the
cauldron
of
the
dagda
a
vessel
which
had
the
property
that
it
could
feed
a
host
of
men
without
ever
being
emptied
with
these
possessions
according
to
the
version
given
in
the
book
of
invasions
the
people
of
dana
came
into
ireland
danaans
and
the
they
were
wafted
into
the
land
in
a
magic
cloud
making
their
first
appearance
in
western
connacht
when
the
cloud
cleared
away
the
firbolgs
discovered
them
in
a
camp
which
they
had
already
fortified
at
moyrein
the
firbolgs
now
sent
out
one
of
their
warriors
named
sreng
to
interview
the
mysterious
and
the
people
of
dana
on
their
side
sent
a
warrior
named
bres
to
represent
them
the
two
ambassadors
examined
each
other
s
weapons
with
great
interest
the
spears
of
the
danaans
we
are
told
were
light
and
those
of
the
firbolgs
were
heavy
and
blunt
to
contrast
the
power
of
science
with
that
of
brute
force
is
here
the
evident
intention
of
the
legend
and
we
are
reminded
of
the
greek
myth
of
the
struggle
of
the
olympian
deities
with
the
titans
bres
proposed
to
the
firbolg
that
the
two
races
should
divide
ireland
equally
between
them
and
join
to
defend
it
against
all
comers
for
the
future
they
then
exchanged
weapons
and
returned
each
to
his
own
camp
first
battle
of
the
firbolgs
however
were
not
impressed
with
the
superiority
of
the
danaans
and
decided
to
refuse
their
offer
the
battle
was
joined
on
the
plain
of
moytura
in
the
south
of
mayo
near
the
spot
now
called
cong
the
firbolgs
were
led
by
their
king
mac
erc
and
the
danaans
by
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
who
got
his
name
from
an
incident
in
this
battle
his
hand
it
is
said
was
cut
off
in
the
fight
and
one
of
the
skilful
artificers
who
abounded
in
the
ranks
of
the
danaans
made
him
a
new
one
of
silver
by
their
magical
and
healing
arts
the
danaans
gained
the
victory
and
the
firbolg
king
was
slain
but
a
reasonable
agreement
followed
the
firbolgs
were
allotted
the
province
of
connacht
for
their
territory
while
the
danaans
took
the
rest
of
ireland
so
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
the
annalist
mac
firbis
discovered
that
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
connacht
traced
their
descent
to
these
same
firbolgs
probably
they
were
a
veritable
historic
race
and
the
conflict
between
them
and
the
people
of
dana
may
be
a
piece
of
actual
history
invested
with
some
of
the
features
of
a
myth
expulsion
of
king
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
should
now
have
been
ruler
of
the
danaans
but
his
mutilation
forbade
it
for
no
blemished
man
might
be
a
king
in
ireland
the
danaans
therefore
chose
bres
who
was
the
son
of
a
danaan
woman
named
eri
but
whose
father
was
unknown
to
reign
over
them
instead
this
was
another
bres
not
the
envoy
who
had
treated
with
the
firbolgs
and
who
was
slain
in
the
battle
of
moytura
now
bres
although
strong
and
beautiful
to
look
on
had
no
gift
of
kingship
for
he
not
only
allowed
the
enemy
of
ireland
the
fomorians
to
renew
their
oppression
and
taxation
in
the
land
but
he
himself
taxed
his
subjects
heavily
too
and
was
so
niggardly
that
he
gave
no
hospitality
to
chiefs
and
nobles
and
harpers
lack
of
generosity
and
hospitality
was
always
reckoned
the
worst
of
vices
in
an
irish
prince
one
day
it
is
said
that
there
came
to
his
court
the
poet
corpry
who
found
himself
housed
in
a
small
dark
chamber
without
fire
or
furniture
where
after
long
delay
he
was
served
with
three
dry
cakes
and
no
ale
in
revenge
he
composed
a
satirical
quatrain
on
his
churlish
host
without
food
quickly
served
without
a
cow
s
milk
whereon
a
calf
can
grow
without
a
dwelling
fit
for
a
man
under
the
gloomy
night
without
means
to
entertain
a
bardic
company
let
such
be
the
condition
of
poetic
satire
in
ireland
was
supposed
to
have
a
kind
of
magical
power
kings
dreaded
it
even
rats
could
be
exterminated
by
it
this
quatrain
of
corpry
s
was
repeated
with
delight
among
the
people
and
bres
had
to
lay
down
his
sovranty
this
was
said
to
be
the
first
satire
ever
made
in
ireland
meantime
because
nuada
had
got
his
silver
hand
through
the
art
of
his
physician
diancecht
or
because
as
some
versions
of
the
legend
say
a
still
greater
healer
the
son
of
diancecht
had
made
the
veritable
hand
grow
again
to
the
stump
he
was
chosen
to
be
king
in
place
of
bres
the
latter
now
betook
himself
in
wrath
and
resentment
to
his
mother
eri
and
begged
her
to
give
him
counsel
and
to
tell
him
of
his
lineage
eri
then
declared
to
him
that
his
father
was
elatha
a
king
of
the
fomorians
who
had
come
to
her
secretly
from
over
sea
and
when
he
departed
had
given
her
a
ring
bidding
her
never
bestow
it
on
any
man
save
him
whose
finger
it
would
fit
she
now
brought
forth
the
ring
and
it
fitted
the
finger
of
bres
who
went
down
with
her
to
the
strand
where
the
fomorian
lover
had
landed
and
they
sailed
together
for
his
father
s
home
tyranny
of
the
elatha
recognised
the
ring
and
gave
his
son
an
army
wherewith
to
reconquer
ireland
and
also
sent
him
to
seek
further
aid
from
the
greatest
of
the
fomorian
kings
balor
now
balor
was
surnamed
of
the
evil
eye
because
the
gaze
of
his
one
eye
could
slay
like
a
thunderbolt
those
on
whom
he
looked
in
anger
he
was
now
however
so
old
and
feeble
that
the
vast
eyelid
drooped
over
the
eye
and
had
to
be
lifted
up
by
his
men
with
ropes
and
pulleys
when
the
time
came
to
turn
it
on
his
foes
nuada
could
make
no
more
head
against
him
than
bres
had
done
when
king
and
the
country
still
groaned
under
the
oppression
of
the
fomorians
and
longed
for
a
champion
and
redeemer
coming
of
a
new
figure
now
comes
into
the
myth
no
other
than
lugh
son
of
kian
the
of
all
celtica
whose
name
we
can
still
identify
in
many
historic
sites
on
the
continent
to
explain
his
appearance
we
must
desert
for
a
moment
the
ancient
manuscript
authorities
which
are
here
incomplete
and
have
to
be
supplemented
by
a
which
was
fortunately
discovered
and
taken
down
orally
so
late
as
the
nineteenth
century
by
the
great
irish
antiquary
o
donovan
in
this
the
names
of
balor
and
his
daughter
ethlinn
the
latter
in
the
form
ethnea
are
preserved
as
well
as
those
of
some
other
mythical
personages
but
that
of
the
father
of
lugh
is
faintly
echoed
in
mackineely
lugh
s
own
name
is
forgotten
and
the
death
of
balor
is
given
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
ancient
myth
in
the
story
as
i
give
it
here
the
antique
names
and
mythical
outline
are
preserved
but
are
supplemented
where
required
from
the
omitting
from
the
latter
those
modern
features
which
are
not
reconcilable
with
the
myth
the
story
then
goes
that
balor
the
fomorian
king
heard
in
a
druidic
prophecy
that
he
would
be
slain
by
his
grandson
his
only
child
was
an
infant
daughter
named
ethlinn
to
avert
the
doom
he
like
acrisios
father
of
danae
in
the
greek
myth
had
her
imprisoned
in
a
high
tower
which
he
caused
to
be
built
on
a
precipitous
headland
the
tor
mōr
in
tory
island
he
placed
the
girl
in
charge
of
twelve
matrons
who
were
strictly
charged
to
prevent
her
from
ever
seeing
the
face
of
man
or
even
learning
that
there
were
any
beings
of
a
different
sex
from
her
own
in
this
seclusion
ethlinn
grew
all
sequestered
princesses
a
maiden
of
surpassing
beauty
now
it
happened
that
there
were
on
the
mainland
three
brothers
namely
kian
sawan
and
goban
the
smith
the
great
armourer
and
artificer
of
irish
myth
who
corresponds
to
wayland
smith
in
germanic
legend
kian
had
a
magical
cow
whose
milk
was
so
abundant
that
every
one
longed
to
possess
her
and
he
had
to
keep
her
strictly
under
protection
balor
determined
to
possess
himself
of
this
cow
one
day
kian
and
sawan
had
come
to
the
forge
to
have
some
weapons
made
for
them
bringing
fine
steel
for
that
purpose
kian
went
into
the
forge
leaving
sawan
in
charge
of
the
cow
balor
now
appeared
on
the
scene
taking
on
himself
the
form
of
a
little
redheaded
boy
and
told
sawan
that
he
had
overheard
the
brothers
inside
the
forge
concocting
a
plan
for
using
all
the
fine
steel
for
their
own
swords
leaving
but
common
metal
for
that
of
sawan
the
latter
in
a
great
rage
gave
the
cow
s
halter
to
the
boy
and
rushed
into
the
forge
to
put
a
stop
to
this
nefarious
scheme
balor
immediately
carried
off
the
cow
and
dragged
her
across
the
sea
to
tory
island
kian
now
determined
to
avenge
himself
on
balor
and
to
this
end
sought
the
advice
of
a
druidess
named
birōg
dressing
himself
in
woman
s
garb
he
was
wafted
by
magical
spells
across
the
sea
where
birōg
who
accompanied
him
represented
to
ethlinn
s
guardians
that
they
were
two
noble
ladies
cast
upon
the
shore
in
escaping
from
an
abductor
and
begged
for
shelter
they
were
admitted
kian
found
means
to
have
access
to
the
princess
ethlinn
while
the
matrons
were
laid
by
birōg
under
the
spell
of
an
enchanted
slumber
and
when
they
awoke
kian
and
the
druidess
had
vanished
as
they
came
but
ethlinn
had
given
kian
her
love
and
soon
her
guardians
found
that
she
was
with
child
fearing
balor
s
wrath
the
matrons
persuaded
her
that
the
whole
transaction
was
but
a
dream
and
said
nothing
about
it
but
in
due
time
ethlinn
was
delivered
of
three
sons
at
a
birth
news
of
this
event
came
to
balor
and
in
anger
and
fear
he
commanded
the
three
infants
to
be
drowned
in
a
whirlpool
off
the
irish
coast
the
messenger
who
was
charged
with
this
command
rolled
up
the
children
in
a
sheet
but
in
carrying
them
to
the
appointed
place
the
pin
of
the
sheet
came
loose
and
one
of
the
children
dropped
out
and
fell
into
a
little
bay
called
to
this
day
na
or
the
haven
of
the
pin
the
other
two
were
duly
drowned
and
the
servant
reported
his
mission
accomplished
but
the
child
who
had
fallen
into
the
bay
was
guarded
by
the
druidess
who
wafted
it
to
the
home
of
its
father
kian
and
kian
gave
it
in
fosterage
to
his
brother
the
smith
who
taught
the
child
his
own
trade
and
made
it
skilled
in
every
manner
of
craft
and
handiwork
this
child
was
lugh
when
he
was
grown
to
a
youth
the
danaans
placed
him
in
charge
of
duach
the
dark
king
of
the
great
plain
fairyland
or
the
land
of
the
living
which
is
also
the
land
of
the
dead
and
here
he
dwelt
till
he
reached
manhood
lugh
was
of
course
the
appointed
redeemer
of
the
danaan
people
from
their
servitude
his
coming
is
narrated
in
a
story
which
brings
out
the
solar
attributes
of
universal
power
and
shows
him
like
apollo
as
the
presiding
deity
of
all
human
knowledge
and
of
all
artistic
and
medicinal
skill
he
came
it
is
told
to
take
service
with
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
and
when
the
doorkeeper
at
the
royal
palace
of
tara
asked
him
what
he
could
do
he
answered
that
he
was
a
carpenter
we
are
in
no
need
of
a
carpenter
said
the
doorkeeper
we
have
an
excellent
one
in
luchta
son
of
i
am
a
smith
too
said
lugh
we
have
a
said
the
doorkeeper
then
i
am
a
warrior
said
lugh
we
do
not
need
one
said
the
doorkeeper
while
we
have
lugh
goes
on
to
name
all
the
occupations
and
arts
he
can
think
is
a
poet
a
harper
a
man
of
science
a
physician
a
spencer
and
so
forth
always
receiving
the
answer
that
a
man
of
supreme
accomplishment
in
that
art
is
already
installed
at
the
court
of
nuada
then
ask
the
king
said
lugh
if
he
has
in
his
service
any
one
man
who
is
accomplished
in
every
one
of
these
arts
and
if
he
have
i
shall
stay
here
no
longer
nor
seek
to
enter
his
upon
this
lugh
is
received
and
the
surname
ildánach
is
conferred
upon
him
meaning
the
prince
of
all
the
sciences
while
another
name
that
he
commonly
bore
was
lugh
lamfada
or
lugh
of
the
long
arm
we
are
reminded
here
as
de
jubainville
points
out
of
the
gaulish
god
whom
caesar
identifies
with
mercury
inventor
of
all
the
arts
and
to
whom
the
gauls
put
up
many
statues
the
irish
myth
supplements
this
information
and
tells
us
the
celtic
name
of
this
deity
when
lugh
came
from
the
land
of
the
living
he
brought
with
him
many
magical
gifts
there
was
the
boat
of
mananan
son
of
lir
the
sea
god
which
knew
a
man
s
thoughts
and
would
travel
whithersoever
he
would
and
the
horse
of
mananan
that
could
go
alike
over
land
and
sea
and
a
terrible
sword
named
the
answerer
that
could
cut
through
any
mail
so
equipped
he
appeared
one
day
before
an
assembly
of
the
danaan
chiefs
who
were
met
to
pay
their
tribute
to
the
envoys
of
the
fomorian
oppressors
and
when
the
danaans
saw
him
they
felt
it
is
said
as
if
they
beheld
the
rising
of
the
sun
on
a
dry
summer
s
day
instead
of
paying
the
tribute
they
under
lugh
s
leadership
attacked
the
fomorians
all
of
whom
were
slain
but
nine
men
and
these
were
sent
back
to
tell
balor
that
the
danaans
defied
him
and
would
pay
no
tribute
henceforward
balor
then
made
him
ready
for
battle
and
bade
his
captains
when
they
had
subdued
the
danaans
make
fast
the
island
by
cables
to
their
ships
and
tow
it
far
northward
to
the
fomorian
regions
of
ice
and
gloom
where
it
would
trouble
them
no
longer
quest
of
the
sons
of
lugh
on
his
side
also
prepared
for
the
final
combat
but
to
ensure
victory
certain
magical
instruments
were
still
needed
for
him
and
these
had
now
to
be
obtained
the
story
of
the
quest
of
these
objects
which
incidentally
tells
us
also
of
the
end
of
lugh
s
father
kian
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
curious
in
irish
legend
and
formed
one
of
a
triad
of
mythical
tales
which
were
reckoned
as
the
flower
of
irish
romance
kian
the
story
goes
was
sent
northward
by
lugh
to
summon
the
fighting
men
of
the
danaans
in
ulster
to
the
hosting
against
the
fomorians
on
his
way
as
he
crosses
the
plain
of
murthemney
near
dundalk
he
meets
with
three
brothers
brian
iuchar
and
iucharba
sons
of
turenn
between
whose
house
and
that
of
kian
there
was
a
he
seeks
to
avoid
them
by
changing
into
the
form
of
a
pig
and
joining
a
herd
which
is
rooting
in
the
plain
but
the
brothers
detect
him
and
brian
wounds
him
with
a
cast
from
a
spear
kian
knowing
that
his
end
is
come
begs
to
be
allowed
to
change
back
into
human
form
before
he
is
slain
i
had
liefer
kill
a
man
than
a
pig
says
brian
who
takes
throughout
the
leading
part
in
all
the
brothers
adventures
kian
then
stands
before
them
as
a
man
with
the
blood
from
brian
s
spear
trickling
from
his
breast
i
have
outwitted
ye
he
cries
for
if
ye
had
slain
a
pig
ye
would
have
paid
but
the
eric
of
a
pig
but
now
ye
shall
pay
the
eric
of
a
man
never
was
greater
eric
than
that
which
ye
shall
pay
and
the
weapons
ye
slay
me
with
shall
tell
the
tale
to
the
avenger
of
then
you
shall
be
slain
with
no
weapons
at
all
says
brian
and
he
and
the
brothers
stone
him
to
death
and
bury
him
in
the
ground
as
deep
as
the
height
of
a
man
but
when
lugh
shortly
afterwards
passes
that
way
the
stones
on
the
plain
cry
out
and
tell
him
of
his
father
s
murder
at
the
hands
of
the
sons
of
turenn
he
uncovers
the
body
and
vowing
vengeance
returns
to
tara
here
he
accuses
the
sons
of
turenn
before
the
high
king
and
is
permitted
to
have
them
executed
or
to
name
the
eric
he
will
accept
in
remission
of
that
sentence
lugh
chooses
to
have
the
eric
and
he
names
it
as
follows
concealing
things
of
vast
price
and
involving
toils
under
the
names
of
common
objects
three
apples
the
skin
of
a
pig
a
spear
a
chariot
with
two
horses
seven
swine
a
hound
a
and
finally
to
give
three
shouts
on
a
hill
the
brothers
bind
themselves
to
pay
the
fine
and
lugh
then
declares
the
meaning
of
it
the
three
apples
are
those
which
grow
in
the
garden
of
the
sun
the
is
a
magical
skin
which
heals
every
wound
and
sickness
if
it
can
be
laid
on
the
sufferer
and
it
is
a
possession
of
the
king
of
greece
the
spear
is
a
magical
weapon
owned
by
the
king
of
persia
these
names
of
course
are
mere
fanciful
appellations
for
places
in
the
mysterious
world
of
faëry
the
seven
swine
belong
to
king
asal
of
the
golden
pillars
and
may
be
killed
and
eaten
every
night
and
yet
be
found
whole
next
day
the
spit
belongs
to
the
of
the
sunken
island
of
finchory
and
the
three
shouts
are
to
be
given
on
the
hill
of
a
fierce
warrior
mochaen
who
with
his
sons
are
under
vows
to
prevent
any
man
from
raising
his
voice
on
that
hill
to
fulfil
any
one
of
these
enterprises
would
be
an
all
but
impossible
task
and
the
brothers
must
accomplish
them
all
before
they
can
clear
themselves
of
the
guilt
and
penalty
of
kian
s
death
the
story
then
goes
on
to
tell
how
with
infinite
daring
and
resource
the
sons
of
turenn
accomplish
one
by
one
all
their
tasks
but
when
all
are
done
save
the
capture
of
the
and
the
three
shouts
on
the
hill
of
mochaen
lugh
by
magical
arts
causes
forgetfulness
to
fall
upon
them
and
they
return
to
ireland
with
their
treasures
these
especially
the
spear
and
the
are
just
what
lugh
needs
to
help
him
against
the
fomorians
but
his
vengeance
is
not
complete
and
after
receiving
the
treasures
he
reminds
the
brothers
of
what
is
yet
to
be
won
they
in
deep
dejection
now
begin
to
understand
how
they
are
played
with
and
go
forth
sadly
to
win
if
they
can
the
rest
of
the
eric
after
long
wandering
they
discover
that
the
island
of
finchory
is
not
above
but
under
the
sea
brian
in
a
magical
goes
down
to
it
sees
the
thrice
fifty
nymphs
in
their
palace
and
seizes
the
golden
spit
from
their
hearth
the
ordeal
of
the
hill
of
mochaen
is
the
last
to
be
attempted
after
a
desperate
combat
which
ends
in
the
slaying
of
mochaen
and
his
sons
the
brothers
mortally
wounded
uplift
their
voices
in
three
faint
cries
and
so
the
eric
is
fulfilled
the
life
is

when
they
return
to
ireland
and
their
aged
father
turenn
implores
lugh
for
the
loan
of
the
magic
to
heal
them
but
the
implacable
lugh
refuses
and
the
brothers
and
their
father
die
together
so
ends
the
tale
second
battle
of
the
second
battle
of
moytura
took
place
on
a
plain
in
the
north
of
sligo
which
is
remarkable
for
the
number
of
sepulchral
monuments
still
scattered
over
it
the
first
battle
of
course
was
that
which
the
danaans
had
waged
with
the
firbolgs
and
the
moytura
there
referred
to
was
much
further
south
in
mayo
the
battle
with
the
fomorians
is
related
with
an
astounding
wealth
of
marvellous
incident
the
craftsmen
of
the
danaans
goban
the
smith
credné
the
artificer
or
goldsmith
and
luchta
the
carpenter
keep
repairing
the
broken
weapons
of
the
danaans
with
magical
blows
of
goban
s
hammer
make
a
spear
or
sword
luchta
flings
a
handle
at
it
and
it
sticks
on
at
once
and
credné
jerks
the
rivets
at
it
with
his
tongs
as
fast
as
he
makes
them
and
they
fly
into
their
places
the
wounded
are
healed
by
the
magical
the
plain
resounds
with
the
clamour
of
battle
fearful
indeed
was
the
thunder
which
rolled
over
the
battlefield
the
shouts
of
the
warriors
the
breaking
of
the
shields
the
flashing
and
clashing
of
the
swords
of
the
straight
swords
the
music
and
harmony
of
the
and
the
sighing
and
winging
of
the
spears
and
death
of
the
fomorians
bring
on
their
champion
balor
before
the
glance
of
whose
terrible
eye
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
and
others
of
the
danaans
go
down
but
lugh
seizing
an
opportunity
when
the
eyelid
drooped
through
weariness
approached
close
to
balor
and
as
it
began
to
lift
once
more
he
hurled
into
the
eye
a
great
stone
which
sank
into
the
brain
and
balor
lay
dead
as
the
prophecy
had
foretold
at
the
hand
of
his
grandson
the
fomorians
were
then
totally
routed
and
it
is
not
recorded
that
they
ever
again
gained
any
authority
or
committed
any
extensive
depredations
in
ireland
lugh
the
ildánach
was
then
enthroned
in
place
of
nuada
and
the
myth
of
the
victory
of
the
solar
hero
over
the
powers
of
darkness
and
brute
force
is
complete
harp
of
the
a
curious
little
incident
bearing
on
the
power
which
the
danaans
could
exercise
by
the
spell
of
music
may
here
be
inserted
the
flying
fomorians
it
is
told
had
made
prisoner
the
harper
of
the
dagda
and
carried
him
off
with
them
lugh
the
dagda
and
the
warrior
ogma
followed
them
and
came
unknown
into
the
of
the
fomorian
camp
there
they
saw
the
harp
hanging
on
the
wall
the
dagda
called
to
it
and
immediately
it
flew
into
his
hands
killing
nine
men
of
the
fomorians
on
its
way
the
dagda
s
invocation
of
the
harp
is
very
singular
and
not
a
little
puzzling
come
murmurer
he
cries
come
frame
of
harmony
come
summer
come
winter
from
the
mouths
of
harps
and
bags
and
the
allusion
to
summer
and
winter
suggests
the
practice
in
indian
music
of
allotting
certain
musical
modes
to
the
different
seasons
of
the
year
and
even
to
different
times
of
day
and
also
an
egyptian
legend
referred
to
in
burney
s
history
of
music
where
the
three
strings
of
the
lyre
were
supposed
to
answer
respectively
to
the
three
seasons
spring
summer
and
winter
when
the
dagda
got
possession
of
the
harp
the
tale
goes
on
he
played
on
it
the
three
noble
strains
which
every
great
master
of
the
harp
should
command
namely
the
strain
of
lament
which
caused
the
hearers
to
weep
the
strain
of
laughter
which
made
them
merry
and
the
strain
of
slumber
or
lullaby
which
plunged
them
all
in
a
profound
sleep
and
under
cover
of
that
sleep
the
danaan
champion
stole
out
and
escaped
it
may
be
observed
that
throughout
the
whole
of
the
legendary
literature
of
ireland
skill
in
music
the
art
whose
influence
most
resembles
that
of
a
mysterious
spell
or
gift
of
faëry
is
the
prerogative
of
the
people
of
dana
and
their
descendants
thus
in
the
colloquy
of
the
ancients
a
collection
of
tales
made
about
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
century
patrick
is
introduced
to
a
minstrel
cascorach
a
handsome
youth
who
plays
so
sweet
a
strain
that
the
saint
and
his
retinue
all
fall
asleep
cascorach
we
are
told
was

of

that
thou

said
patrick
but
for
a
twang
of
the
fairy

that
infests

which
nothing
could
more
nearly
resemble

some
of
the
most
beautiful
of

traditionally
supposed
to
have
been
overheard
by
mortal
harpers
at
the
revels
of
the
fairy
folk
and
characteristics
of
the
danaan
i
may
conclude
this
narrative
of
the
danaan
conquest
with
some
account
of
the
principal
danaan
gods
and
their
attributes
which
will
be
useful
to
readers
of
the
subsequent
pages
the
best
with
which
i
am
acquainted
is
to
be
found
in
standish
o
grady
s
critical
history
of
this
work
is
no
less
remarkable
for
its
critical
was
published
in
when
scientific
study
of
the
celtic
mythology
was
little
heard
for
the
true
bardic
imagination
kindred
to
that
of
the
ancient
themselves
which
recreates
the
dead
forms
of
the
past
and
dilates
them
with
the
breath
of
life
the
broad
outlines
in
which
o
grady
has
laid
down
the
typical
characteristics
of
the
chief
personages
in
the
danaan
cycle
hardly
need
any
correction
at
this
day
and
have
been
of
much
use
to
me
in
the
following
summary
of
the
subject
the
dagda
mōr
was
the
father
and
chief
of
the
people
of
dana
a
certain
conception
of
vastness
attaches
to
him
and
to
his
doings
in
the
second
battle
of
moytura
his
blows
sweep
down
whole
ranks
of
the
enemy
and
his
spear
when
he
trails
it
on
the
march
draws
a
furrow
in
the
ground
like
the
fosse
which
marks
the
mearing
of
a
province
an
element
of
grotesque
humour
is
present
in
some
of
the
records
about
this
deity
when
the
fomorians
give
him
food
on
his
visit
to
their
camp
the
porridge
and
milk
are
poured
into
a
great
pit
in
the
ground
and
he
eats
it
with
a
spoon
big
enough
it
was
said
for
a
man
and
a
woman
to
lie
together
in
it
with
this
spoon
he
scrapes
the
pit
when
the
porridge
is
done
and
shovels
earth
and
gravel
unconcernedly
down
his
throat
we
have
already
seen
that
like
all
the
danaans
he
is
a
master
of
music
as
well
as
of
other
magical
endowments
and
owns
a
harp
which
comes
flying
through
the
air
at
his
call
the
tendency
to
attribute
life
to
inanimate
things
is
apparent
in
the
homeric
literature
but
exercises
a
very
great
influence
in
the
mythology
of
this
country
the
living
fiery
spear
of
lugh
the
magic
ship
of
mananan
the
sword
of
conary
mōr
which
sang
cuchulain
s
sword
which
spoke
the
lia
fail
stone
of
destiny
which
roared
for
joy
beneath
the
feet
of
rightful
kings
the
waves
of
the
ocean
roaring
with
rage
and
sorrow
when
such
kings
are
in
jeopardy
the
waters
of
the
avon
dia
holding
back
for
fear
at
the
mighty
duel
between
cuchulain
and
ferdia
are
but
a
few
out
of
many
a
legend
of
later
times
tells
how
once
at
the
death
of
a
great
scholar
all
the
books
in
ireland
fell
from
their
shelves
upon
the
floor
angus
ōg
angus
the
young
son
of
the
dagda
by
boanna
the
river
boyne
was
the
irish
god
of
love
his
palace
was
supposed
to
be
at
new
grange
on
the
boyne
four
bright
birds
that
ever
hovered
about
his
head
were
supposed
to
be
his
kisses
taking
shape
in
this
lovely
form
and
at
their
singing
love
came
springing
up
in
the
hearts
of
youths
and
maidens
once
he
fell
sick
of
love
for
a
maiden
whom
he
had
seen
in
a
dream
he
told
the
cause
of
his
sickness
to
his
mother
boanna
who
searched
all
ireland
for
the
girl
but
could
not
find
her
then
the
dagda
was
called
in
but
he
too
was
at
a
loss
till
he
called
to
his
aid
bōv
the
red
king
of
the
danaans
of
same
whom
we
have
met
with
in
the
tale
of
the
children
of
lir
and
who
was
skilled
in
all
mysteries
and
enchantments
bōv
undertook
the
search
and
after
a
year
had
gone
by
declared
that
he
had
found
the
visionary
maiden
at
a
lake
called
the
lake
of
the
dragon
s
mouth
angus
goes
to
bōv
and
after
being
entertained
by
him
three
days
is
brought
to
the
lake
shore
where
he
sees
thrice
fifty
maidens
walking
in
couples
each
couple
linked
by
a
chain
of
gold
but
one
of
them
is
taller
than
the
rest
by
a
head
and
shoulders
that
is
she
cries
angus
tell
us
by
what
name
she
is
bōv
answers
that
her
name
is
caer
daughter
of
ethal
anubal
a
prince
of
the
danaans
of
connacht
angus
laments
that
he
is
not
strong
enough
to
carry
her
off
from
her
companions
but
on
bōv
s
advice
betakes
himself
to
ailell
and
maev
the
mortal
king
and
queen
of
connacht
for
assistance
the
dagda
and
angus
then
both
repair
to
the
palace
of
ailell
who
feasts
them
for
a
week
and
then
asks
the
cause
of
their
coming
when
it
is
declared
he
answers
we
have
no
authority
over
ethal
they
send
a
message
to
him
however
asking
for
the
hand
of
caer
for
angus
but
ethal
refuses
to
give
her
up
in
the
end
he
is
besieged
by
the
combined
forces
of
ailell
and
the
dagda
and
taken
prisoner
when
caer
is
again
demanded
of
him
he
declares
that
he
can
not
comply
for
she
is
more
powerful
than
he
explains
that
she
lives
alternately
in
the
form
of
a
maiden
and
of
a
swan
year
and
year
about
and
on
the
first
of
november
next
he
says
you
will
see
her
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
other
swans
at
the
lake
of
the
dragon
s
angus
goes
there
at
the
appointed
time
and
cries
to
her
oh
come
and
speak
to
me
who
calls
me
asks
caer
angus
explains
who
he
is
and
then
finds
himself
transformed
into
a
swan
this
is
an
indication
of
consent
and
he
plunges
in
to
join
his
love
in
the
lake
after
that
they
fly
together
to
the
palace
on
the
boyne
uttering
as
they
go
a
music
so
divine
that
all
hearers
are
lulled
to
sleep
for
three
days
and
nights
angus
is
the
special
deity
and
friend
of
beautiful
youths
and
maidens
dermot
of
the
a
follower
of
finn
mac
cumhal
and
lover
of
grania
of
whom
we
shall
hear
later
was
bred
up
with
angus
in
the
palace
on
the
boyne
he
was
the
typical
lover
of
irish
legend
when
he
was
slain
by
the
wild
boar
of
ben
bulben
angus
revives
him
and
carries
him
off
to
share
his
immortality
in
his
fairy
palace
of
of
bōv
the
red
brother
of
the
dagda
we
have
already
heard
he
had
it
is
said
a
goldsmith
named
len
who
gave
their
ancient
name
to
the
lakes
of
killarney
once
known
as
locha
lein
the
lakes
of
len
of
the
many
hammers
here
by
the
lake
he
wrought
surrounded
by
rainbows
and
showers
of
fiery
lugh
has
already
been
described
he
has
more
distinctly
solar
attributes
than
any
other
celtic
deity
and
as
we
know
his
worship
was
spread
widely
over
continental
celtica
in
the
tale
of
the
quest
of
the
sons
of
turenn
we
are
told
that
lugh
approached
the
fomorians
from
the
west
then
bres
son
of
balor
arose
and
said
i
wonder
that
the
sun
is
rising
in
the
west
and
in
the
east
every
other
would
it
were
so
said
his
druids
why
what
else
but
the
sun
is
it
said
bres
it
is
the
radiance
of
the
face
of
lugh
of
the
long
arm
they
replied
lugh
was
the
father
by
the
milesian
maiden
dectera
of
cuchulain
the
most
heroic
figure
in
irish
legend
in
whose
story
there
is
evidently
a
strong
element
of
the
solar
myth
the
midir
the
proud
is
a
son
of
the
dagda
his
fairy
palace
is
at
or
slieve
callary
in
longford
he
frequently
appears
in
legends
dealing
partly
with
human
partly
with
danaan
personages
and
is
always
represented
as
a
type
of
splendour
in
his
apparel
and
in
personal
beauty
when
he
appears
to
king
eochy
on
the
hill
of
tara
he
is
thus
described
it
chanced
that
eochaid
airemm
the
king
of
tara
arose
upon
a
certain
fair
day
in
the
time
of
summer
and
he
ascended
the
high
ground
of
tara
to
behold
the
plain
of
breg
beautiful
was
the
colour
of
that
plain
and
there
was
upon
it
excellent
blossom
glowing
with
all
hues
that
are
known
and
as
the
aforesaid
eochy
looked
about
and
around
him
he
saw
a
young
strange
warrior
upon
the
high
ground
at
his
side
the
tunic
that
the
warrior
wore
was
purple
in
colour
his
hair
was
of
a
golden
yellow
and
of
such
length
that
it
reached
to
the
edge
of
his
shoulders
the
eyes
of
the
young
warrior
were
lustrous
and
grey
in
the
one
hand
he
held
a
fine
pointed
spear
in
the
other
a
shield
with
a
white
central
boss
and
with
gems
of
gold
upon
it
and
eochaid
held
his
peace
for
he
knew
that
none
such
had
been
in
tara
on
the
night
before
and
the
gate
that
led
into
the
had
not
at
that
time
been
thrown
and
lir
as
o
grady
remarks
appears
in
two
distinct
forms
in
the
first
he
is
a
vast
impersonal
presence
commensurate
with
the
sea
in
fact
the
greek
oceanus
in
the
second
he
is
a
separate
person
dwelling
invisibly
on
slieve
fuad
in
armagh
we
hear
little
of
him
in
irish
legend
where
the
attributes
of
the
are
mostly
conferred
on
his
son
mananan
this
deity
is
one
of
the
most
popular
in
irish
mythology
he
was
lord
of
the
sea
beyond
or
under
which
the
land
of
youth
or
islands
of
the
dead
were
supposed
to
lie
he
therefore
was
the
guide
of
man
to
this
country
he
was
master
of
tricks
and
illusions
and
owned
all
kinds
of
magical
boat
named
which
obeyed
the
thought
of
those
who
sailed
in
it
and
went
without
oar
or
sail
the
steed
aonbarr
which
could
travel
alike
on
sea
or
land
and
the
sword
named
the
answerer
which
no
armour
could
resist
waves
were
called
the
horses
of
mananan
and
it
was
forbidden
for
the
solar
hero
cuchulain
to
perceive
indicated
the
daily
death
of
the
sun
at
his
setting
in
the
western
waves
mananan
wore
a
great
cloak
which
was
capable
of
taking
on
every
kind
of
colour
like
the
widespread
field
of
the
sea
as
looked
on
from
a
height
and
as
the
protector
of
the
island
of
erin
it
was
said
that
when
any
hostile
force
invaded
it
they
heard
his
thunderous
tramp
and
the
flapping
of
his
mighty
cloak
as
he
marched
angrily
round
and
round
their
camp
at
night
the
isle
of
man
seen
dimly
from
the
irish
coast
was
supposed
to
be
the
throne
of
mananan
and
to
take
its
name
from
this
deity
goddess
the
greatest
of
the
danaan
goddesses
was
dana
mother
of
the
irish
gods
as
she
is
called
in
an
early
text
she
was
daughter
of
the
dagda
and
like
him
associated
with
ideas
of
fertility
and
blessing
according
to
d
arbois
de
jubainville
she
was

to
have
been

but
one
person
in
the
usual
irish
fashion
of
conceiving
the
divine
power
in
triads
the
name
of
brian
who
takes
the
lead
in
all
the
exploits
of
the
brethren
is
a
derivation
from
a
more
ancient
form
brenos
and
under
this
form
was
the
god
to
whom
the
celts
attributed
their
victories
at
the
allia
and
at
delphi
mistaken
by
roman
and
greek
chroniclers
for
an
earthly
leader
there
was
also
an
extraordinary
goddess
named
the
morrigan
who
appears
to
embody
all
that
is
perverse
and
horrible
among
supernatural
powers
she
delighted
in
setting
men
at
war
and
fought
among
them
herself
changing
into
many
frightful
shapes
and
often
hovering
above
fighting
armies
in
the
aspect
of
a
crow
she
met
cuchulain
once
and
proffered
him
her
love
in
the
guise
of
a
human
maid
he
refused
it
and
she
persecuted
him
thenceforward
for
the
most
of
his
life
warring
with
him
once
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
she
turned
herself
into
a
and
then
into
a
mass
of
seeking
to
entangle
and
drown
him
but
he
conquered
and
wounded
her
and
she
afterwards
became
his
friend
before
his
last
battle
she
passed
through
emain
macha
at
night
and
broke
the
pole
of
his
chariot
as
a
warning
s
one
of
the
most
notable
landmarks
of
ireland
was
the
or
wave
of
cleena
on
the
seashore
at
glandore
bay
in
cork
the
story
about
cleena
exists
in
several
versions
which
do
not
agree
with
each
other
except
in
so
far
as
she
seems
to
have
been
a
danaan
maiden
once
living
in
mananan
s
country
the
land
of
youth
beyond
the
sea
escaping
thence
with
a
mortal
lover
as
one
of
the
versions
tells
she
landed
on
the
southern
coast
of
ireland
and
her
lover
keevan
of
the
curling
locks
went
off
to
hunt
in
the
woods
cleena
who
remained
on
the
beach
was
lulled
to
sleep
by
fairy
music
played
by
a
minstrel
of
mananan
when
a
great
wave
of
the
sea
swept
up
and
carried
her
back
to
fairyland
leaving
her
lover
desolate
hence
the
place
was
called
the
strand
of
cleena
s
wave
goddess
another
topical
goddess
was
ainé
the
patroness
of
munster
who
is
still
venerated
by
the
people
of
that
county
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
danaan
owel
a
of
mananan
and
a
druid
she
is
in
some
sort
a
continually
inspiring
mortals
with
passion
she
was
ravished
it
was
said
by
ailill
olum
king
of
munster
who
was
slain
in
consequence
by
her
magic
arts
and
the
story
is
repeated
in
far
later
times
about
another
mortal
lover
who
was
not
however
slain
a
fitzgerald
to
whom
she
bore
the
famous
wizard
earl
many
of
the
aristocratic
families
of

claimed
descent
from
this
union
her
name
still
clings
to
the
hill
of
ainé
knockainey
near
loch
gur
in
munster
all
the
danaan
deities
in
the
popular
imagination
were
associated
with
ideas
of
fertility
and
increase
ainé

not
heard
much
of
in
the
bardic
literature
but
she
is
very
prominent
in
the
of
the
neighbourhood
at
the
bidding
of
her
son
earl
gerald
she
planted
all
knockainey
with
pease
in
a
single
night
she
was
and
perhaps
still
is
worshipped
on
midsummer
eve
by
the
peasantry
who
carried
torches
of
hay
and
straw
tied
on
poles
and
lighted
round
her
hill
at
night
afterwards
they
dispersed
themselves
among
their
cultivated
fields
and
pastures
waving
the
torches
over
the
crops
and
the
cattle
to
bring
luck
and
increase
for
the
following
year
on
one
night
as
told
by
fitzgerald
who
has
collected
the
local
traditions
about
her
the
ceremony
was
omitted
owing
to
the
death
of
one
of
the
neighbours
yet
the
peasantry
at
night
saw
the
torches
in
greater
number
than
ever
circling
the
hill
and
ainé
herself
in
front
directing
and
ordering
the
procession
on
another
john
s
night
a
number
of
girls
had
stayed
late
on
the
hill
watching
the
torches
and
joining
in
the
games
suddenly
ainé
appeared
among
them
thanked
them
for
the
honour
they
had
done
her
but
said
she
now
wished
them
to
go
home
as
wanted
the
hill
to
she
let
them
understand
whom
she
meant
by
for
calling
some
of
the
girls
she
made
them
look
through
a
ring
when
behold
the
hill
appeared
crowded
with
people
before
here
observed
alfred
nutt
we
have
the
antique
ritual
carried
out
on
a
spot
hallowed
to
one
of
the
antique
powers
watched
over
and
shared
in
by
those
powers
themselves
nowhere
save
in
gaeldom
could
be
found
such
a
pregnant
illustration
of
the
identity
of
the
fairy
class
with
the
venerable
powers
to
ensure
whose
goodwill
rites
and
sacrifices
originally
fierce
and
bloody
now
a
mere
simulacrum
of
their
pristine
form
have
been
performed
for
countless
and
the
well
of
there
is
a
singular
myth
which
while
intended
to
account
for
the
name
of
the
river
shannon
expresses
the
celtic
veneration
for
poetry
and
science
combined
with
the
warning
that
they
may
not
be
approached
without
danger
the
goddess
sinend
it
was
said
daughter
of
lodan
son
of
lir
went
to
a
certain
well
named
connla
s
well
which
is
under
the
in
the
land
of
youth
in
fairyland
that
is
a
well
says
the
bardic
narrative
at
which
are
the
hazels
of
wisdom
and
inspirations
that
is
the
hazels
of
the
science
of
poetry
and
in
the
same
hour
their
fruit
and
their
blossom
and
their
foliage
break
forth
and
then
fall
upon
the
well
in
the

shower
which
raises
upon
the
water
a
royal
surge
of
when
sinend
came
to
the
well
we
are
not
told
what
rites
or
preparation
she
had
omitted
but
the
angry
waters
broke
forth
and
overwhelmed
her
and
washed
her
up
on
the
shannon
shore
where
she
died
giving
to
the
river
its
name
this
myth
of
the
hazels
of
inspiration
and
knowledge
and
their
association
with
springing
water
runs
through
all
irish
legend
and
has
been
finely
treated
by
a
living
irish
poet
russell
in
the
following
verses
a
cabin
on
the
hid
in
a
grassy
nook
with
door
and
window
open
wide
where
friendly
stars
may
look
the
rabbit
shy
may
patter
in
the
winds
may
enter
free
who
roam
around
the
mountain
throne
in
living
ecstasy
and
when
the
sun
sets
dimmed
in
eve
and
purple
fills
the
air
i
think
the
sacred
is
dropping
berries
there
from
starry
fruitage
waved
aloft
where
connla
s
well
o
erflows
for
sure
the
immortal
waters
run
through
every
wind
that
blows
i
think
when
night
towers
up
aloft
and
shakes
the
trembling
dew
how
every
high
and
lonely
thought
that
thrills
my
spirit
through
is
but
a
shining
berry
dropped
down
through
the
purple
air
and
from
the
magic
tree
of
life
the
fruit
falls
coming
of
the
after
the
second
battle
of
moytura
the
danaans
held
rule
in
ireland
until
the
coming
of
the
milesians
the
sons
of
miled
these
are
conceived
in
irish
legend
as
an
entirely
human
race
yet
in
their
origin
they
like
the
other
invaders
of
ireland
go
back
to
a
divine
and
mythical
ancestry
miled
whose
name
occurs
as
a
god
in
a
celtic
inscription
from
hungary
is
represented
as
a
son
of
bilé
bilé
like
balor
is
one
of
the
names
of
the
god
of
death
of
the
underworld
they
come
from
spain
usual
term
employed
by
the
later
rationalising
historians
for
the
land
of
the
dead
the
manner
of
their
coming
into
ireland
was
as
follows
ith
the
grandfather
of
miled
dwelt
in
a
great
tower
which
his
father
bregon
had
built
in
one
clear
winter
s
day
when
looking
out
westwards
from
this
lofty
tower
he
saw
the
coast
of
ireland
in
the
distance
and
resolved
to
sail
to
the
unknown
land
he
embarked
with
ninety
warriors
and
took
land
at
corcadyna
in
the
in
connexion
with
this
episode
i
may
quote
a
passage
of
great
beauty
and
interest
from
de
jubainville
s
irish
mythological
cycle
according
to
an
unknown
writer
cited
by
plutarch
who
died
about
the
year
of
the
present
era
and
also
by
procopius
who
wrote
in
the
sixth
century
the
land
of
the
dead
is
the
western
extremity
of
great
britain
separated
from
the
eastern
by
an
impassable
wall
on
the
northern
coast
of
gaul
says
the
legend
is
a
populace
of
mariners
whose
business
is
to
carry
the
dead
across
from
the
continent
to
their
last
abode
in
the
island
of
britain
the
mariners
awakened
in
the
night
by
the
whisperings
of
some
mysterious
voice
arise
and
go
down
to
the
shore
where
they
find
ships
awaiting
them
which
are
not
their
own
and
in
these
invisible
beings
under
whose
weight
the
vessels
sink
almost
to
the
gunwales
they
go
on
board
and
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
oar
says
one
text
in
one
hour
says
another
they
arrive
at
their
destination
though
with
their
own
vessels
aided
by
sails
it
would
have
taken
them
at
least
a
day
and
a
night
to
reach
the
coast
of
britain
when
they
come
to
the
other
shore
the
invisible
passengers
land
and
at
the
same
time
the
unloaded
ships
are
seen
to
rise
above
the
waves
and
a
voice
is
heard
announcing
the
names
of
the
new
arrivals
who
have
just
been
added
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
the
dead
one
stroke
of
the
oar
one
hour
s
voyage
at
most
suffices
for
the
midnight
journey
which
transfers
the
dead
from
the
gaulish
continent
to
their
final
abode
some
mysterious
law
indeed
brings
together
in
the
night
the
great
spaces
which
divide
the
domain
of
the
living
from
that
of
the
dead
in
daytime
it
was
the
same
law
which
enabled
ith
one
fine
winter
evening
to
perceive
from
the
tower
of
bregon
in
the
land
of
the
dead
the
shores
of
ireland
or
the
land
of
the
living
the
phenomenon
took
place
in
winter
for
winter
is
a
sort
of
night
winter
like
night
lowers
the
barriers
between
the
regions
of
death
and
those
of
life
like
night
winter
gives
to
life
the
semblance
of
death
and
suppresses
as
it
were
the
dread
abyss
that
lies
between
the
at
this
time
it
is
said
ireland
was
ruled
by
three
danaan
kings
grandsons
of
the
dagda
their
names
were
maccuill
maccecht
and
macgrené
and
their
wives
were
named
respectively
banba
fohla
and
eriu
the
celtic
habit
of
conceiving
divine
persons
in
triads
is
here
illustrated
these
triads
represent
one
person
each
and
the
mythical
character
of
that
personage
is
evident
from
the
name
of
one
of
them
macgrené
son
of
the
sun
the
names
of
the
three
goddesses
have
each
at
different
times
been
applied
to
ireland
but
that
of
the
third
eriu
has
alone
persisted
and
in
the
dative
form
erinn
is
a
poetic
name
for
the
country
to
this
day
that
eriu
is
the
wife
of
macgrené
means
as
de
jubainville
observes
that
the
the
god
of
day
life
and
science
has
wedded
the
land
and
is
reigning
over
it
ith
on
landing
finds
that
the
danaan
king
neit
has
just
been
slain
in
a
battle
with
the
fomorians
and
the
three
sons
maccuill
and
the
others
are
at
the
fortress
of
aileach
in
donegal
arranging
for
a
division
of
the
land
among
themselves
at
first
they
welcome
ith
and
ask
him
to
settle
their
inheritance
ith
gives
his
judgment
but
in
concluding
his
admiration
for
the
newly
discovered
country
breaks
out
act
he
says
according
to
the
laws
of
justice
for
the
country
you
dwell
in
is
a
good
one
it
is
rich
in
fruit
and
honey
in
wheat
and
in
fish
and
in
heat
and
cold
it
is
from
this
panegyric
the
danaans
conclude
that
has
designs
upon
their
land
and
they
seize
him
and
put
him
to
death
his
companions
however
recover
his
body
and
bear
it
back
with
them
in
their
ships
to
spain
when
the
children
of
miled
resolve
to
take
vengeance
for
the
outrage
and
prepare
to
invade
ireland
they
were
commanded
by
chiefs
each
having
his
own
ship
with
his
family
and
his
followers
two
of
the
company
are
said
to
have
perished
on
the
way
one
of
the
sons
of
miled
having
climbed
to
the
masthead
of
his
vessel
to
look
out
for
the
coast
of
ireland
fell
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned
the
other
was
skena
wife
of
the
poet
amergin
son
of
miled
who
died
on
the
way
the
milesians
buried
her
when
they
landed
and
called
the
place
inverskena
after
her
this
was
the
ancient
name
of
the
kenmare
river
in
kerry
it
was
on
a
thursday
the
first
of
may
and
the
seventeenth
day
of
the
moon
that
the
sons
of
miled
arrived
in
ireland
partholan
also
landed
in
ireland
on
the
first
of
may
but
on
a
different
day
of
the
week
and
of
the
moon
and
it
was
on
the
first
day
of
may
too
that
the
pestilence
came
which
in
the
space
of
one
week
destroyed
utterly
his
race
the
first
of
may
was
sacred
to
beltené
one
of
the
names
of
the
god
of
death
the
god
who
gives
life
to
men
and
takes
it
away
from
them
again
thus
it
was
on
the
feast
day
of
this
god
that
the
sons
of
miled
began
their
conquest
of
poet
when
the
poet
amergin
set
foot
upon
the
soil
of
ireland
it
is
said
that
he
chanted
a
strange
and
mystical
lay
i

i

observes
upon
this
strange
utterance
there
is
a
lack
of
order
in
this
composition
the
ideas
fundamental
and
subordinate
are
jumbled
together
without
method
but
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
the
poet
is
the
word
of
science
he
is
the
god
who
gives
to
man
the
fire
of

to
be
fairly
theirs
by
right
of
battle
the
milesians
submit
to
this
decision
and
embark
on
their
ships
but
no
sooner
have
they
drawn
for
this
mystical
distance
of
the
nine
waves
than
a
mist
and
storm
are
raised
by
the
sorceries
of
the
coast
of
ireland
is
hidden
from
their
sight
and
they
wander
dispersed
upon
the
ocean
to
ascertain
if
it
is
a
natural
or
a
druidic
tempest
which
afflicts
them
a
man
named
aranan
is
sent
up
to
the
masthead
to
see
if
the
wind
is
blowing
there
also
or
not
he
is
flung
from
the
swaying
mast
but
as
he
falls
to
his
death
he
cries
his
message
to
his
shipmates
there
is
no
storm
amergin
who
as
is
to
say
the
lead
in
all
critical
situations
thereupon
chants
his
incantation
to
the
land
of
erin
the
wind
falls
and
they
turn
their
prows
rejoicing
towards
the
shore
but
one
of
the
milesian
lords
eber
donn
exults
in
brutal
rage
at
the
prospect
of
putting
all
the
dwellers
in
ireland
to
the
sword
the
tempest
immediately
springs
up
again
and
many
of
the
milesian
ships
founder
eber
donn
s
being
among
them
at
last
a
remnant
of
the
milesians
find
their
way
to
shore
and
land
in
the
estuary
of
the
boyne
defeat
of
the
a
great
battle
with
the
danaans
at
telltown
then
follows
the
three
kings
and
three
queens
of
the
danaans
with
many
of
their
people
are
slain
and
the
children
of
last
of
the
mythical
invaders
of
upon
the
sovranty
of
ireland
but
the
people
of
dana
do
not
withdraw
by
their
magic
art
they
cast
over
themselves
a
veil
of
invisibility
which
they
can
put
on
or
off
as
they
choose
there
are
two
irelands
henceforward
the
spiritual
and
the
earthly
the
danaans
dwell
in
the
spiritual
ireland
which
is
portioned
out
among
them
by
their
great
overlord
the
dagda
where
the
human
eye
can
see
but
green
mounds
and
ramparts
the
relics
of
ruined
fortresses
or
sepulchres
there
rise
the
fairy
palaces
of
the
defeated
divinities
there
they
hold
their
revels
in
eternal
sunshine
nourished
by
the
magic
meat
and
ale
that
give
them
undying
youth
and
beauty
and
thence
they
come
forth
at
times
to
mingle
with
mortal
men
in
love
or
in
war
the
ancient
mythical
literature
conceives
them
as
heroic
and
splendid
in
strength
and
beauty
in
later
times
and
as
christian
influences
grew
stronger
they
dwindle
into
fairies
the
people
of
the
sidhe
but
they
have
never
wholly
perished
to
this
day
the
land
of
youth
and
its
inhabitants
live
in
the
imagination
of
the
irish
peasant
meaning
of
the
danaan
all
myths
constructed
by
a
primitive
people
are
symbols
and
if
we
can
discover
what
it
is
that
they
symbolise
we
have
a
valuable
clue
to
the
spiritual
character
and
sometimes
even
to
the
history
of
the
people
from
whom
they
sprang
now
the
meaning
of
the
danaan
myth
as
it
appears
in
the
bardic
literature
though
it
has
undergone
much
distortion
before
it
reached
us
is
perfectly
clear
the
danaans
represent
the
celtic
reverence
for
science
poetry
and
artistic
skill
blended
of
course
with
the
earlier
conception
of
the
divinity
of
the
powers
of
light
in
their
combat
with
the
firbolgs
the
victory
of
the
intellect
over
dulness
and
ignorance
is
plainly
comparison
of
the
heavy
blunt
weapon
of
the
firbolgs
with
the
light
and
penetrating
spears
of
the
people
of
dana
is
an
indication
which
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
again
in
their
struggle
with
a
far
more
powerful
and
dangerous
enemy
the
fomorians
we
are
evidently
to
see
the
combat
of
the
powers
of
light
with
evil
of
a
more
positive
kind
than
that
represented
by
the
firbolgs
the
fomorians
stand
not
for
mere
dulness
or
stupidity
but
for
the
forces
of
tyranny
cruelty
and
moral
rather
than
for
intellectual
darkness
meaning
of
the
milesian
but
the
myth
of
the
struggle
of
the
danaans
with
the
sons
of
miled
is
more
difficult
to
interpret
how
does
it
come
that
the
lords
of
light
and
beauty
wielding
all
the
powers
of
thought
represented
by
magic
and
sorcery
succumbed
to
a
human
race
and
were
dispossessed
by
them
of
their
inheritance
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
shrinking
of
their
powers
which
at
once
took
place
when
the
milesians
came
on
the
scene
the
milesians
were
not
on
the
side
of
the
powers
of
darkness
they
were
guided
by
amergin
a
clear
embodiment
of
the
idea
of
poetry
and
thought
they
were
regarded
with
the
utmost
veneration
and
the
dominant
families
of
ireland
all
traced
their
descent
to
them
was
the
kingdom
of
light
then
divided
against
itself
or
if
not
to
what
conception
in
the
irish
mind
are
we
to
trace
the
myth
of
the
milesian
invasion
and
victory
the
only
answer
i
can
see
to
this
puzzling
question
is
to
suppose
that
the
milesian
myth
originated
at
a
much
later
time
than
the
others
and
was
in
its
main
features
the
product
of
christian
influences
the
people
of
dana
were
in
possession
of
the
country
but
they
were
pagan
could
not
stand
for
the
progenitors
of
a
christian
ireland
they
had
somehow
or
other
to
be
got
rid
of
and
a
race
of
less
embarrassing
antecedents
substituted
for
them
so
the
milesians
were
fetched
from
spain
and
endowed
with
the
main
characteristics
only
more
humanised
of
the
people
of
dana
but
the
latter
in
contradistinction
to
the
usual
attitude
of
early
christianity
are
treated
very
tenderly
in
the
story
of
their
overthrow
one
of
them
has
the
honour
of
giving
her
name
to
the
island
the
brutality
of
one
of
the
conquerors
towards
them
is
punished
with
death
and
while
dispossessed
of
the
lordship
of
the
soil
they
still
enjoy
life
in
the
fair
world
which
by
their
magic
art
they
have
made
invisible
to
mortals
they
are
no
longer
gods
but
they
are
more
than
human
and
frequent
instances
occur
in
which
they
are
shown
as
coming
forth
from
their
fairy
world
being
embraced
in
the
christian
fold
and
entering
into
heavenly
bliss
with
two
cases
of
this
redemption
of
the
danaans
we
shall
close
this
chapter
on
the
invasion
myths
of
ireland
the
first
is
the
strange
and
beautiful
tale
of
the
transformation
of
the
children
of
lir
children
of
lir
was
a
danaan
divinity
the
father
of
the
mananan
who
continually
occurs
in
magical
tales
of
the
milesian
cycle
he
had
married
in
succession
two
sisters
the
second
of
whom
was
named
aoife
she
was
childless
but
the
former
wife
of
lir
had
left
him
four
children
a
girl
named
fionuala
and
three
boys
the
intense
love
of
lir
for
the
children
made
the
stepmother
jealous
and
she
ultimately
resolved
on
their
destruction
it
will
be
observed
by
the
way
that
the
people
of
dana
though
conceived
as
unaffected
by
time
and
naturally
immortal
are
nevertheless
subject
to
violent
death
either
at
the
hands
of
each
other
or
even
of
mortals
with
her
guilty
object
in
view
aoife
goes
on
a
journey
to
a
neighbouring
danaan
king
bōv
the
red
taking
the
four
children
with
her
arriving
at
a
lonely
place
by
lake
derryvaragh
in
westmeath
she
orders
her
attendants
to
slay
the
children
they
refuse
and
rebuke
her
then
she
resolves
to
do
it
herself
but
says
the
legend
her
womanhood
overcame
her
and
instead
of
killing
the
children
she
transforms
them
by
spells
of
sorcery
into
four
white
swans
and
lays
on
them
the
following
doom
three
hundred
years
they
are
to
spend
on
the
waters
of
lake
derryvaragh
three
hundred
on
the
straits
of
moyle
between
ireland
and
scotland
and
three
hundred
on
the
atlantic
by
erris
and
inishglory
after
that
when
the
woman
of
the
south
is
mated
with
the
man
of
the
north
the
enchantment
is
to
have
an
end
when
the
children
fail
to
arrive
with
aoife
at
the
palace
of
bōv
her
guilt
is
discovered
and
bōv
changes
her
into
a
demon
of
the
she
flies
forth
shrieking
and
is
heard
of
no
more
in
the
tale
but
lir
and
bōv
seek
out
the
and
find
that
they
have
not
only
human
speech
but
have
preserved
the
characteristic
danaan
gift
of
making
wonderful
music
from
all
parts
of
the
island
companies
of
the
danaan
folk
resort
to
lake
derryvaragh
to
hear
this
wondrous
music
and
to
converse
with
the
swans
and
during
that
time
a
great
peace
and
gentleness
seemed
to
pervade
the
land
but
at
last
the
day
came
for
them
to
leave
the
fellowship
of
their
kind
and
take
up
their
life
by
the
wild
cliffs
and
ever
angry
sea
of
the
northern
coast
here
they
knew
the
worst
of
loneliness
cold
and
storm
forbidden
to
land
their
feathers
froze
to
the
rocks
in
the
winter
nights
and
they
were
often
buffeted
and
driven
apart
by
storms
as
fionuala
sings
cruel
to
us
was
aoife
who
played
her
magic
upon
us
and
drove
us
out
on
the
four
wonderful
swans
our
bath
is
the
frothing
brine
in
bays
by
red
rocks
guarded
for
mead
at
our
father
s
table
we
drink
of
the
salt
blue
sea
three
sons
and
a
single
daughter
in
clefts
of
the
cold
rocks
dwelling
the
hard
rocks
cruel
to
we
are
full
of
keening
fionuala
the
eldest
of
the
four
takes
the
lead
in
all
their
doings
and
mothers
the
younger
children
most
tenderly
wrapping
her
plumage
round
them
on
nights
of
frost
at
last
the
time
comes
to
enter
on
the
third
and
last
period
of
their
doom
and
they
take
flight
for
the
western
shores
of
mayo
here
too
they
suffer
much
hardship
but
the
milesians
have
now
come
into
the
land
and
a
young
farmer
named
evric
dwelling
on
the
shores
of
erris
bay
finds
out
who
and
what
the
swans
are
and
befriends
them
to
him
they
tell
their
story
and
through
him
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
preserved
and
handed
down
when
the
final
period
of
their
suffering
is
close
at
hand
they
resolve
to
fly
towards
the
palace
of
their
father
lir
who
dwells
we
are
told
at
the
hill
of
the
white
field
in
armagh
to
see
how
things
have
fared
with
him
they
do
so
but
not
knowing
what
has
happened
on
the
coming
of
the
milesians
they
are
shocked
and
bewildered
to
find
nothing
but
green
mounds
and
and
nettles
where
once
still
stands
only
that
they
can
not
see
palace
of
their
father
their
eyes
are
holden
we
are
to
understand
because
a
higher
destiny
was
in
store
for
them
than
to
return
to
the
land
of
youth
on
erris
bay
they
hear
for
the
first
time
the
sound
of
a
christian
bell
it
comes
from
the
chapel
of
a
hermit
who
has
established
himself
there
the
swans
are
at
first
startled
and
terrified
by
the
thin
dreadful
sound
but
afterwards
approach
and
make
themselves
known
to
the
hermit
who
instructs
them
in
the
faith
and
they
join
him
in
singing
the
offices
of
the
church
now
it
happens
that
a
princess
of
munster
deoca
the
woman
of
the
south
became
betrothed
to
a
connacht
chief
named
lairgnen
and
begged
him
as
a
wedding
gift
to
procure
for
her
the
four
wonderful
singing
swans
whose
fame
had
come
to
her
he
asks
them
of
the
hermit
who
refuses
to
give
them
up
whereupon
the
man
of
the
north
seizes
them
violently
by
the
silver
chains
with
which
the
hermit
had
coupled
them
and
drags
them
off
to
deoca
this
is
their
last
trial
arrived
in
her
presence
an
awful
transformation
befalls
them
the
swan
plumage
falls
off
and
reveals
not
indeed
the
radiant
forms
of
the
danaan
divinities
but
four
withered
and
miserable
human
beings
shrunken
in
the
decrepitude
of
their
vast
old
age
lairgnen
flies
from
the
place
in
horror
but
the
hermit
prepares
to
administer
baptism
at
once
as
death
is
rapidly
approaching
them
lay
us
in
one
grave
says
fionuala
and
place
conn
at
my
right
hand
and
fiachra
at
my
left
and
hugh
before
my
face
for
there
they
were
wont
to
be
when
i
sheltered
them
many
a
winter
night
upon
the
seas
of
and
so
it
was
done
and
they
went
to
heaven
but
the
hermit
it
is
said
sorrowed
for
them
to
the
end
of
his
earthly
days
in
all
celtic
legend
there
is
no
more
tender
and
beautiful
tale
than
this
of
the
children
of
lir
tale
of
but
the
imagination
of
the
celtic
bard
always
played
with
delight
on
the
subjects
of
these
transition
tales
where
the
reconciling
of
the
pagan
order
with
the
christian
was
the
theme
the
same
conception
is
embodied
in
the
tale
of
ethné
which
we
have
now
to
tell
it
is
said
that
mananan
mac
lir
had
a
daughter
who
was
given
in
fosterage
to
the
danaan
prince
angus
whose
fairy
palace
was
at
brugh
na
boyna
this
is
the
great
sepulchral
tumulus
now
called
new
grange
on
the
boyne
at
the
same
time
the
steward
of
angus
had
a
daughter
born
to
him
whose
name
was
ethné
and
who
was
allotted
to
the
young
princess
as
her
handmaiden
ethné
grew
up
into
a
lovely
and
gentle
maiden
but
it
was
discovered
one
day
that
she
took
no
nourishment
of
any
kind
although
the
rest
of
the
household
fed
as
usual
on
the
magic
swine
of
mananan
which
might
be
eaten
and
were
alive
again
for
the
feast
mananan
was
called
in
to
penetrate
the
mystery
and
the
following
curious
story
came
to
light
one
of
the
chieftains
of
the
danaans
who
had
been
on
a
visit
with
angus
smitten
by
the
girl
s
beauty
had
endeavoured
to
possess
her
by
force
this
woke
in
ethné
s
pure
spirit
the
moral
nature
which
is
proper
to
man
and
which
the
danaan
divinities
know
not
as
the
tale
says
her
guardian
demon
left
her
and
an
angel
of
the
true
god
took
its
place
after
that
event
she
abstained
altogether
from
the
food
of
faëry
and
was
miraculously
nourished
by
the
will
of
god
after
a
time
however
mananan
and
angus
who
had
been
on
a
voyage
to
the
east
brought
back
thence
two
cows
whose
milk
never
ran
dry
and
as
they
were
supposed
to
have
come
from
a
sacred
land
ethné
lived
on
their
milk
thenceforward
all
this
is
supposed
to
have
happened
during
the
reign
of
eremon
the
first
milesian
king
of
all
ireland
who
was
contemporary
with
king
david
at
the
time
of
the
coming
of
patrick
therefore
ethné
would
have
been
about
fifteen
hundred
years
of
age
the
danaan
folk
grow
up
from
childhood
to
maturity
but
then
they
abide
unaffected
by
the
lapse
of
time
now
it
happened
one
summer
day
that
the
danaan
princess
whose
handmaid
ethné
was
went
down
with
all
her
maidens
to
bathe
in
the
river
boyne
when
arraying
themselves
afterwards
ethné
discovered
to
her
this
incident
was
of
course
an
instance
of
divine
interest
in
her
she
had
lost
the
veil
of
invisibility
conceived
here
as
a
magic
charm
worn
on
the
person
which
gave
her
the
entrance
to
the
danaan
fairyland
and
hid
her
from
mortal
eyes
she
could
not
find
her
way
back
to
the
palace
of
angus
and
wandered
up
and
down
the
banks
of
the
river
seeking
in
vain
for
her
companions
and
her
home
at
last
she
came
to
a
walled
garden
and
looking
through
the
gate
saw
inside
a
stone
house
of
strange
appearance
and
a
man
in
a
long
brown
robe
the
man
was
a
christian
monk
and
the
house
was
a
little
church
or
oratory
he
beckoned
her
in
and
when
she
had
told
her
story
to
him
he
brought
her
to
patrick
who
completed
her
adoption
into
the
human
family
by
giving
her
the
rite
of
baptism
now
comes
in
a
strangely
pathetic
episode
which
reveals
the
tenderness
almost
the
regret
with
which
early
irish
christianity
looked
back
on
the
lost
world
of
paganism
as
ethné
was
one
day
praying
in
the
little
church
by
the
boyne
she
heard
suddenly
a
rushing
sound
in
the
air
and
innumerable
voices
as
it
seemed
from
a
great
distance
lamenting
and
calling
her
name
it
was
her
danaan
kindred
who
were
still
seeking
for
her
in
vain
she
sprang
up
to
reply
but
was
so
overcome
with
emotion
that
she
fell
in
a
swoon
on
the
floor
she
recovered
her
senses
after
a
while
but
from
that
day
she
was
struck
with
a
mortal
sickness
and
in
no
long
time
she
died
with
her
head
upon
the
breast
of
patrick
who
administered
to
her
the
last
rites
and
ordained
that
the
church
should
be
named
after
her
kill
name
doubtless
borne
at
the
time
the
story
was
composed
by
some
real
church
on
the
banks
of
boyne
and
paganism
in
these
taken
together
with
numerous
other
legendary
incidents
which
might
be
quoted
illustrate
well
the
attitude
of
the
early
celtic
christians
in
ireland
at
least
towards
the
divinities
of
the
older
faith
they
seem
to
preclude
the
idea
that
at
the
time
of
the
conversion
of
ireland
the
pagan
religion
was
associated
with
cruel
and
barbarous
practices
on
which
the
national
memory
would
look
back
with
horror
and
detestation
chapter
iv
the
early
milesian
kings
danaans
after
the
milesian
the
kings
and
heroes
of
the
milesian
race
now
fill
the
foreground
of
the
stage
in
irish
legendary
history
but
as
we
have
indicated
the
danaan
divinities
are
by
no
means
forgotten
the
fairyland
in
which
they
dwell
is
ordinarily
inaccessible
to
mortals
yet
it
is
ever
near
at
hand
the
invisible
barriers
may
be
and
often
are
crossed
by
mortal
men
and
the
danaans
themselves
frequently
come
forth
from
them
mortals
may
win
brides
of
faëry
who
mysteriously
leave
them
after
a
while
and
women
bear
glorious
children
of
supernatural
fatherhood
yet
whatever
the
danaans
may
have
been
in
the
original
conceptions
of
the
celtic
irish
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
they
figure
in
the
legends
as
these
have
now
come
down
to
us
in
the
light
of
gods
as
we
understand
this
term
they
are
for
the
most
part
radiantly
beautiful
they
are
immortal
with
limitations
and
they
wield
mysterious
powers
of
sorcery
and
enchantment
but
no
sort
of
moral
governance
of
the
world
is
ever
for
a
moment
ascribed
to
them
nor
in
the
bardic
literature
is
any
act
of
worship
paid
to
them
they
do
not
die
naturally
but
they
can
be
slain
both
by
each
other
and
by
mortals
and
on
the
whole
the
mortal
race
is
the
stronger
their
strength
when
they
come
into
conflict
as
frequently
happens
with
men
lies
in
stratagem
and
illusion
when
the
issue
can
be
fairly
knit
between
the
rival
powers
it
is
the
human
that
conquers
the
early
kings
and
heroes
of
the
milesian
race
are
indeed
often
represented
as
so
mightily
endowed
with
supernatural
power
that
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
clear
distinction
between
them
and
the
people
of
dana
in
this
respect
the
danaans
are
much
nobler
and
more
exalted
beings
as
they
figure
in
the
bardic
literature
than
the
fairies
into
which
they
ultimately
degenerated
in
the
popular
imagination
they
may
be
said
to
hold
a
position
intermediate
between
these
and
the
greek
deities
as
portrayed
in
homer
but
the
true
worship
of
the
celts
in
ireland
as
elsewhere
seems
to
have
been
paid
not
to
these
poetical
personifications
of
their
ideals
of
power
and
beauty
but
rather
to
elemental
forces
represented
by
actual
natural
rivers
the
sun
the
wind
the
sea
the
most
binding
of
oaths
was
to
swear
by
the
wind
and
sun
or
to
invoke
some
other
power
of
nature
no
name
of
any
danaan
divinity
occurs
in
an
irish
oath
formula
when
however
in
the
later
stages
of
the
bardic
literature
and
still
more
in
the
popular
conceptions
the
danaan
deities
had
begun
to
sink
into
fairies
we
find
rising
into
prominence
a
character
probably
older
than
that
ascribed
to
them
in
the
literature
and
in
a
way
more
august
in
the
literature
it
is
evident
that
they
were
originally
representatives
of
science
and
intellectual
powers
of
man
but
in
the
popular
mind
they
represented
probably
at
all
times
and
certainly
in
later
christian
times
not
intellectual
powers
but
those
associated
with
the
fecundity
of
earth
they
were
as
a
passage
in
the
book
of
armagh
names
them
and
were
and
are
still
invoked
by
the
peasantry
to
yield
increase
and
fertility
the
literary
conception
of
them
is
plainly
druidic
in
origin
the
other
popular
and
the
popular
and
doubtless
older
conception
has
proved
the
more
enduring
but
these
features
of
irish
mythology
will
appear
better
in
the
actual
tales
than
in
any
critical
discussion
of
them
and
to
the
tales
let
us
now
return
milesian
settlement
of
the
milesians
had
three
leaders
when
they
set
out
for
the
conquest
of
donn
brown
eber
eber
finn
fair
eber
and
eremon
of
these
the
as
we
have
seen
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
perished
as
a
punishment
for
his
brutality
when
the
victory
over
the
danaans
was
secure
the
two
remaining
brothers
turned
to
the
druid
amergin
for
a
judgment
as
to
their
respective
titles
to
the
sovranty
eremon
was
the
elder
of
the
two
but
eber
refused
to
submit
to
him
thus
irish
history
begins
alas
with
dissension
and
jealousy
amergin
decided
that
the
land
should
belong
to
eremon
for
his
life
and
pass
to
eber
after
his
death
but
eber
refused
to
submit
to
the
award
and
demanded
an
immediate
partition
of
the
territory
this
was
agreed
to
and
eber
took
the
southern
half
of
ireland
from
the
boyne
to
the
wave
of
cleena
while
eremon
occupied
the
north
but
even
so
the
brethren
could
not
be
at
peace
and
after
a
short
while
war
broke
out
between
them
eber
was
slain
and
eremon
became
sole
king
of
ireland
which
he
ruled
from
tara
the
traditional
seat
of
that
central
authority
which
was
always
a
dream
of
the
irish
mind
but
never
a
reality
of
irish
history
and
crom
of
the
kings
who
succeeded
eremon
and
the
battles
they
fought
and
the
forests
they
cleared
away
and
the
rivers
and
lakes
that
broke
out
in
their
reign
there
is
little
of
note
to
record
till
we
come
to
the
reign
of
tiernmas
fifth
in
succession
from
eremon
he
is
said
to
have
introduced
into
ireland
the
worship
of
crom
cruach
on
moyslaught
the
plain
of
adoration
and
to
have
perished
himself
with
of
his
people
while
worshipping
this
idol
on
november
eve
the
period
when
the
reign
of
winter
was
inaugurated
crom
cruach
was
no
doubt
a
solar
deity
but
no
figure
at
all
resembling
him
can
be
identified
among
the
danaan
divinities
tiernmas
also
it
is
said
found
the
first
in
ireland
and
introduced
variegated
colours
into
the
clothing
of
the
people
a
slave
might
wear
but
one
colour
a
peasant
two
a
soldier
three
a
wealthy
landowner
four
a
provincial
chief
five
and
an
ollav
or
royal
person
six
ollav
was
a
term
applied
to
a
certain
druidic
rank
it
meant
much
the
same
as
doctor
in
the
sense
of
a
learned
master
of
science
it
is
a
characteristic
trait
that
the
ollav
is
endowed
with
a
distinction
equal
to
that
of
a
king
the
most
distinguished
ollav
of
ireland
was
also
a
king
the
celebrated
ollav
fōla
who
is
supposed
to
have
been
eighteenth
from
eremon
and
to
have
reigned
about
he
was
the
lycurgus
or
solon
of
ireland
giving
to
the
country
a
code
of
legislature
and
also
subdividing
it
under
the
high
king
at
tara
among
the
provincial
chiefs
to
each
of
whom
his
proper
rights
and
obligations
were
allotted
to
ollav
fōla
is
also
attributed
the
foundation
of
an
institution
which
whatever
its
origin
became
of
great
importance
in
great
triennial
fair
or
festival
at
tara
where
the
and
chiefs
bards
historians
and
musicians
from
all
parts
of
ireland
assembled
to
make
up
the
genealogical
records
of
the
clan
chieftainships
to
enact
laws
hear
disputed
cases
settle
succession
and
so
forth
all
these
political
and
legislative
labours
being
lightened
by
song
and
feast
it
was
a
stringent
law
that
at
this
season
all
enmities
must
be
laid
aside
no
man
might
lift
his
hand
against
another
or
even
institute
a
legal
process
while
the
assembly
at
tara
was
in
progress
of
all
political
and
national
institutions
of
this
kind
ollav
fōla
was
regarded
as
the
traditional
founder
just
as
goban
the
smith
was
the
founder
of
artistry
and
handicraft
and
amergin
of
poetry
but
whether
the
milesian
king
had
any
more
objective
reality
than
the
other
more
obviously
mythical
figures
it
is
hard
to
say
he
is
supposed
to
have
been
buried
in
the
great
tumulus
at
loughcrew
in
westmeath
and
the
founding
of
emain
with
kimbay
about
we
come
to
a
landmark
in
history
all
the
historical
records
of
the
irish
prior
to
kimbay
were
dubious
with
remarkable
critical
acumen
for
his
age
wrote
the
historian
tierna
of
clonmacnois
there
is
much
that
is
dubious
in
those
that
follow
but
we
are
certainly
on
firmer
historical
ground
with
the
reign
of
kimbay
one
great
fact
emerges
into
light
we
have
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of
ulster
at
its
centre
emain
macha
a
name
redolent
to
the
irish
student
of
legendary
splendour
and
heroism
emain
macha
is
now
represented
by
the
grassy
ramparts
of
a
great
close
to
ard
macha
armagh
according
to
one
of
the
derivations
offered
in
keating
s
history
of
ireland
is
derived
from
a
bodkin
and
the
neck
the
word
being
thus
equivalent
to
brooch
and
emain
macha
means
the
brooch
of
macha
an
irish
brooch
was
a
large
circular
wheel
of
gold
or
bronze
crossed
by
a
long
pin
and
the
great
circular
rampart
surrounding
a
celtic
fortress
might
well
be
imaginatively
likened
to
the
brooch
or
a
giantess
guarding
her
cloak
or
territory
the
legend
of
macha
tells
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
red
hugh
an
ulster
prince
who
had
two
brothers
dithorba
and
kimbay
they
agreed
to
enjoy
each
in
turn
the
sovranty
of
ireland
red
hugh
came
first
but
on
his
death
macha
refused
to
give
up
the
realm
and
fought
dithorba
for
it
whom
she
conquered
and
slew
she
then
in
equally
masterful
manner
compelled
kimbay
to
wed
her
and
ruled
all
ireland
as
queen
i
give
the
rest
of
the
tale
in
the
words
of
standish
o
grady
the
five
sons
of
dithorba
having
been
expelled
out
of
ulster
fled
across
the
shannon
and
in
the
west
of
the
kingdom
plotted
against
macha
then
the
queen
went
down
alone
into
connacht
and
found
the
brothers
in
the
forest
where
wearied
with
the
chase
they
were
cooking
a
wild
boar
which
they
had
slain
and
were
carousing
before
a
fire
which
they
had
kindled
she
appeared
in
her
grimmest
aspect
as
the
red
all
over
terrible
and
hideous
as
war
itself
but
with
bright
and
flashing
eyes
one
by
one
the
brothers
were
inflamed
by
her
sinister
beauty
and
one
by
one
she
overpowered
and
bound
them
then
she
lifted
her
burthen
of
champions
upon
her
back
and
returned
with
them
into
the
north
with
the
spear
of
her
brooch
she
marked
out
on
the
plain
the
circuit
of
the
city
of
emain
macha
whose
ramparts
and
trenches
were
constructed
by
the
captive
princes
labouring
like
slaves
under
her
the
underlying
idea
of
all
this
class
of
legend
remarks
o
grady
is
that
if
men
can
not
master
war
war
will
master
them
and
that
those
who
aspired
to
the
of
all
erin
must
have
the
on
their
macha
is
an
instance
of
the
intermingling
of
the
attributes
of
the
danaan
with
the
human
race
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
and
the
next
king
who
comes
into
legendary
prominence
is
ugainy
the
great
who
is
said
to
have
ruled
not
only
all
ireland
but
a
great
part
of
western
europe
and
to
have
wedded
a
gaulish
princess
named
kesair
he
had
two
sons
laery
and
covac
the
former
inherited
the
kingdom
but
covac
consumed
and
sick
with
envy
sought
to
slay
him
and
asked
the
advice
of
a
druid
as
to
how
this
could
be
managed
since
laery
justly
suspicious
never
would
visit
him
without
an
armed
escort
the
druid
bade
him
feign
death
and
have
word
sent
to
his
brother
that
he
was
on
his
bier
ready
for
burial
this
covac
did
and
when
laery
arrived
and
bent
over
the
supposed
corpse
covac
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
and
slew
also
one
of
his
sons
ailill
who
attended
him
then
covac
ascended
the
throne
and
straightway
his
illness
left
him
of
maon
son
of
he
did
a
brutal
deed
however
upon
a
son
of
ailill
s
named
maon
about
whom
a
number
of
legends
cluster
maon
as
a
child
was
brought
into
covac
s
presence
and
was
there
compelled
says
keating
to
swallow
a
portion
of
his
father
s
and
grandfather
s
hearts
and
also
a
mouse
with
her
young
from
the
disgust
he
felt
the
child
lost
his
speech
and
seeing
him
dumb
and
therefore
innocuous
covac
let
him
go
the
boy
was
then
taken
into
munster
to
the
kingdom
of
feramorc
of
which
scoriath
was
king
and
remained
with
him
some
time
but
afterwards
went
to
gaul
his
kesair
s
country
where
his
guards
told
the
king
that
he
was
heir
to
the
throne
of
ireland
and
he
was
treated
with
great
honour
and
grew
up
into
a
noble
youth
but
he
left
behind
him
in
the
heart
of
moriath
daughter
of
the
king
of
feramorc
a
passion
that
could
not
be
stilled
and
she
resolved
to
bring
him
back
to
ireland
she
accordingly
equipped
her
father
s
harper
craftiny
with
many
rich
gifts
and
wrote
for
him
a
in
which
her
passion
for
maon
was
set
forth
and
to
which
craftiny
composed
an
enchanting
melody
arrived
in
france
craftiny
made
his
way
to
the
king
s
court
and
found
occasion
to
pour
out
his
lay
to
maon
so
deeply
stirred
was
he
by
the
beauty
and
passion
of
the
song
that
his
speech
returned
to
him
and
he
broke
out
into
praises
of
it
and
was
thenceforth
dumb
no
more
the
king
of
gaul
then
equipped
him
with
an
armed
force
and
sent
him
to
ireland
to
regain
his
kingdom
learning
that
covac
was
at
a
place
near
at
hand
named
dinrigh
maon
and
his
body
of
gauls
made
a
sudden
attack
upon
him
and
slew
him
there
and
then
with
all
his
nobles
and
guards
after
the
slaughter
a
druid
of
covac
s
company
asked
one
of
the
gauls
who
their
leader
was
the
mariner
replied
the
gaul
meaning
the
captain
of
the
maon
can
he
speak
inquired
the
druid
who
had
begun
to
suspect
the
truth
he
does
speak
said
the
man
and
henceforth
the
name
labra
the
mariner
clung
to
maon
son
of
ailill
nor
was
he
known
by
any
other
he
then
sought
out
moriath
wedded
her
and
reigned
over
ireland
ten
years
from
this
invasion
of
the
gauls
the
name
of
the
province
of
leinster
is
traditionally
derived
they
were
armed
with
spears
having
broad
iron
heads
called
pronounced
lyna
and
as
they
were
allotted
lands
in
leinster
and
settled
there
the
province
was
called
in
irish
after
province
of
the
spearmen
of
labra
the
mariner
after
his
accession
a
curious
tale
is
told
he
was
accustomed
it
is
said
to
have
his
hair
cropped
but
once
a
year
and
the
man
to
do
this
was
chosen
by
lot
and
was
immediately
afterwards
put
to
death
the
reason
of
this
was
that
like
king
midas
in
the
similar
greek
myth
he
had
long
ears
like
those
of
a
horse
and
he
would
not
have
this
deformity
known
once
it
fell
however
that
the
person
chosen
to
crop
his
hair
was
the
only
son
of
a
poor
widow
by
whose
tears
and
entreaties
the
king
was
prevailed
upon
to
let
him
live
on
condition
that
he
swore
by
the
wind
and
sun
to
tell
no
man
what
he
might
see
the
oath
was
taken
and
the
young
man
returned
to
his
mother
but
the
secret
so
preyed
on
his
mind
that
he
fell
into
a
sore
sickness
and
was
near
to
death
when
a
wise
druid
was
called
in
to
heal
him
it
is
the
secret
that
is
killing
him
said
the
druid
and
he
will
never
be
well
till
he
reveals
it
let
him
therefore
go
along
the
till
he
come
to
a
place
where
four
roads
meet
let
him
there
turn
to
the
right
and
the
first
tree
he
shall
meet
on
the
road
let
him
tell
his
secret
to
that
and
he
shall
be
rid
of
it
and
so
the
youth
did
and
the
first
tree
was
a
willow
he
laid
his
lips
close
to
the
bark
whispered
his
secret
to
it
and
went
home
as
of
old
but
it
chanced
that
shortly
after
this
the
harper
craftiny
broke
his
harp
and
needed
a
new
one
and
as
luck
would
have
it
the
first
suitable
tree
he
came
to
was
the
willow
that
had
the
king
s
secret
he
cut
it
down
made
his
harp
from
it
and
performed
that
night
as
usual
in
the
king
s
hall
when
to
the
amazement
of
all
as
soon
as
the
harper
touched
the
strings
the
assembled
guests
heard
them
chime
the
words
two
horse
s
ears
hath
labra
the
the
king
then
seeing
that
the
secret
was
out
plucked
off
his
hood
and
showed
himself
plainly
nor
was
any
man
put
to
death
again
on
account
of
this
mystery
we
have
seen
that
the
compelling
power
of
craftiny
s
music
had
formerly
cured
labra
s
dumbness
the
sense
of
something
magical
in
music
as
though
supernatural
powers
spoke
through
it
is
of
constant
recurrence
in
irish
legend
of
conary
we
now
come
to
a
cycle
of
legends
centering
on
or
rather
closing
with
the
wonderful
figure
of
the
high
king
conary
cycle
so
charged
with
splendour
mystery
and
romance
that
to
do
it
justice
would
require
far
more
space
than
can
be
given
to
it
within
the
limits
of
this
work
in
the
preliminary
events
of
the
cycle
are
transacted
in
the
land
of
youth
the
mystic
country
of
the
people
of
dana
after
their
dispossession
by
the
children
of
miled
midir
the
proud
son
of
the
dagda
a
danaan
prince
dwelling
on
slieve
callary
had
a
wife
named
fuamnach
after
a
while
he
took
to
himself
another
bride
etain
whose
beauty
and
grace
were
beyond
compare
so
that
as
fair
as
etain
became
a
proverbial
comparison
for
any
beauty
that
exceeded
all
other
standards
fuamnach
therefore
became
jealous
of
her
rival
and
having
by
magic
art
changed
her
into
a
butterfly
she
raised
a
tempest
that
drove
her
forth
from
the
palace
and
kept
her
for
seven
years
buffeted
hither
and
thither
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
erin
at
last
however
a
chance
gust
of
wind
blew
her
through
a
window
of
the
fairy
palace
of
angus
on
the
boyne
the
immortals
can
not
be
hidden
from
each
other
and
angus
knew
what
she
was
unable
to
release
her
altogether
from
the
spell
of
fuamnach
he
made
a
sunny
bower
for
her
and
planted
round
it
all
manner
of
choice
and
flowers
on
which
she
lived
as
long
as
she
was
with
him
while
in
the
secrecy
of
the
night
he
restored
her
to
her
own
form
and
enjoyed
her
love
in
time
however
her
refuge
was
discovered
by
fuamnach
again
the
magic
tempest
descended
upon
her
and
drove
her
forth
and
this
time
a
singular
fate
was
hers
blown
into
the
palace
of
an
ulster
chieftain
named
etar
she
fell
into
the
of
etar
s
wife
just
as
the
latter
was
about
to
drink
she
was
swallowed
in
the
draught
and
in
due
time
having
passed
into
the
womb
of
etar
s
wife
she
was
born
as
an
apparently
mortal
child
and
grew
up
to
maidenhood
knowing
nothing
of
her
real
nature
and
ancestry
and
about
this
time
it
happened
that
the
high
king
of
ireland
eochy
being
wifeless
and
urged
by
the
nobles
of
his
land
to
take
a
for
without
thou
do
so
they
said
we
will
not
bring
our
wives
to
the
assembly
at
tara
forth
to
inquire
for
a
fair
and
noble
maiden
to
share
his
throne
the
messengers
report
that
etain
daughter
of
etar
is
the
fairest
maiden
in
ireland
and
the
king
journeys
forth
to
visit
her
a
piece
of
description
here
follows
which
is
one
of
the
most
highly
wrought
and
splendid
in
celtic
or
perhaps
in
any
literature
eochy
finds
etain
with
her
maidens
by
a
spring
of
water
whither
she
had
gone
forth
to
wash
her
hair
a
clear
comb
of
silver
was
held
in
her
hand
the
comb
was
adorned
with
gold
and
near
her
as
for
washing
was
a
bason
of
silver
whereon
four
birds
had
been
chased
and
there
were
little
bright
gems
of
carbuncles
on
the
rims
of
the
bason
a
bright
purple
mantle
waved
round
her
and
beneath
it
was
another
mantle
ornamented
with
silver
fringes
the
outer
mantle
was
clasped
over
her
bosom
with
a
golden
brooch
a
tunic
she
wore
with
a
long
hood
that
might
cover
her
head
attached
to
it
it
was
stiff
and
glossy
with
green
silk
beneath
red
embroidery
of
gold
and
was
clasped
over
her
breasts
with
marvellously
wrought
clasps
of
silver
and
gold
so
that
men
saw
the
bright
gold
and
the
green
silk
flashing
against
the
sun
on
her
head
were
two
tresses
of
golden
hair
and
each
tress
had
been
plaited
into
four
strands
at
the
end
of
each
strand
was
a
little
ball
of
gold
and
there
was
that
maiden
undoing
her
hair
that
she
might
wash
it
her
two
arms
out
through
the
armholes
of
her
smock
each
of
her
two
arms
was
as
white
as
the
snow
of
a
single
night
and
each
of
her
cheeks
was
as
rosy
as
the
foxglove
even
and
small
were
the
teeth
in
her
head
and
they
shone
like
pearls
her
eyes
were
as
blue
as
a
hyacinth
her
lips
delicate
and
crimson
very
high
soft
and
white
were
her
shoulders
tender
polished
and
white
were
her
wrists
her
fingers
long
and
of
great
whiteness
her
nails
were
beautiful
and
pink
white
as
snow
or
the
foam
of
a
wave
was
her
neck
long
was
it
slender
and
as
soft
as
silk
smooth
and
white
were
her
thighs
her
knees
were
round
and
firm
and
white
her
ankles
were
as
straight
as
the
rule
of
a
carpenter
her
feet
were
slim
and
as
white
as
the
ocean
s
foam
evenly
set
were
her
eyes
her
eyebrows
were
of
a
bluish
black
such
as
you
see
upon
the
shell
of
a
beetle
never
a
maid
fairer
than
she
or
more
worthy
of
love
was
till
then
seen
by
the
eyes
of
men
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
she
must
be
one
of
those
that
have
come
from
the
fairy
the
king
wooed
her
and
made
her
his
wife
and
brought
her
back
to
tara
of
it
happened
that
the
king
had
a
brother
named
ailill
who
on
seeing
etain
was
so
smitten
with
her
beauty
that
he
fell
sick
of
the
intensity
of
his
passion
and
wasted
almost
to
death
while
he
was
in
this
condition
eochy
had
to
make
a
royal
progress
through
ireland
he
left
his
cause
of
whose
malady
none
etain
s
care
bidding
her
do
what
she
could
for
him
and
if
he
died
to
bury
him
with
due
ceremonies
and
erect
an
ogham
stone
above
his
grave
etain
goes
to
visit
the
brother
she
inquires
the
cause
of
his
illness
he
speaks
to
her
in
enigmas
but
at
last
moved
beyond
control
by
her
tenderness
he
breaks
out
in
an
avowal
of
his
passion
his
description
of
the
yearning
of
hopeless
love
is
a
lyric
of
extraordinary
intensity
it
is
closer
than
the
skin
he
cries
it
is
like
a
battle
with
a
spectre
it
overwhelms
like
a
flood
it
is
a
weapon
under
the
sea
it
is
a
passion
for
an
by
a
weapon
under
the
sea
the
poet
means
that
love
is
like
one
of
the
secret
treasures
of
the
in
the
kingdom
of
wonderful
and
as
unattainable
etain
is
now
in
some
perplexity
but
she
decides
with
a
kind
of
naïve
that
although
she
is
not
in
the
least
in
love
with
ailill
she
can
not
see
a
man
die
of
longing
for
her
and
she
promises
to
be
his
possibly
we
are
to
understand
here
that
she
was
prompted
by
the
fairy
nature
ignorant
of
good
and
evil
and
alive
only
to
pleasure
and
to
suffering
it
must
be
said
however
that
in
the
irish
myths
in
general
this
as
we
may
call
it
fairy
view
of
morality
is
the
one
generally
prevalent
both
among
danaans
and
alike
strike
one
as
morally
irresponsible
etain
now
arranges
a
tryst
with
ailill
in
a
house
outside
of
she
will
not
do
what
she
calls
her
glorious
crime
in
the
king
s
palace
but
ailill
on
the
eve
of
the
appointed
day
falls
into
a
profound
slumber
and
misses
his
appointment
a
being
in
his
shape
does
however
come
to
etain
but
merely
to
speak
coldly
and
sorrowfully
of
his
malady
and
departs
again
when
the
two
meet
once
more
the
situation
is
altogether
changed
in
ailill
s
enchanted
sleep
his
unholy
passion
for
the
queen
has
passed
entirely
away
etain
on
the
other
hand
becomes
aware
that
behind
the
visible
events
there
are
mysteries
which
she
does
not
understand
the
the
explanation
soon
follows
the
being
who
came
to
her
in
the
shape
of
ailill
was
her
danaan
husband
midir
the
proud
he
now
comes
to
woo
her
in
his
true
shape
beautiful
and
nobly
apparelled
and
entreats
her
to
fly
with
him
to
the
land
of
youth
where
she
can
be
safe
henceforward
since
her
persecutor
fuamnach
is
dead
he
it
was
who
shed
upon
ailill
s
eyes
the
magic
slumber
his
description
of
the
fairyland
to
which
he
invites
her
is
given
in
verses
of
great
beauty
land
of
o
woman
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
marvellous
land
full
of
music
where
the
hair
is
and
the
body
white
as
snow
there
none
speaks
of
mine
or
thine
are
the
teeth
and
black
the
brows
eyes
flash
with
lights
and
the
hue
of
the
foxglove
is
on
every
cheek
pleasant
to
the
eye
are
the
plains
of
erin
but
they
are
a
desert
to
the
great
plain
heady
is
the
ale
of
erin
but
the
ale
of
the
great
plain
is
headier
it
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
that
land
that
youth
does
not
change
into
age
smooth
and
sweet
are
the
streams
that
flow
through
it
mead
and
wine
abound
of
every
kind
there
men
are
all
fair
without
blemish
there
women
conceive
without
sin
we
see
around
us
on
every
side
yet
no
man
seeth
us
the
cloud
of
the
sin
of
adam
hides
us
from
their
observation
o
lady
if
thou
wilt
come
to
my
strong
people
the
purest
of
gold
shall
be
on
thy
meat
shall
be
swine
s
flesh
unsalted
new
milk
and
mead
shall
thou
drink
with
me
there
o
woman
i
have
given
this
remarkable
lyric
at
length
because
though
christian
and
ascetic
ideas
are
obviously
discernible
in
it
it
represents
on
the
whole
the
pagan
and
mythical
conception
of
the
land
of
youth
the
country
of
the
dead
etain
however
is
by
no
means
ready
to
go
away
with
a
stranger
and
to
desert
the
high
king
for
a
man
without
name
or
midir
tells
her
who
he
is
and
all
her
own
history
of
which
in
her
present
incarnation
she
knows
nothing
and
he
adds
that
it
was
one
thousand
and
twelve
years
from
etain
s
birth
in
the
land
of
youth
till
she
was
born
a
mortal
child
to
the
wife
of
etar
ultimately
etain
agrees
to
return
with
midir
to
her
ancient
home
but
only
on
condition
that
the
king
will
agree
to
their
severance
and
with
this
midir
has
to
be
content
for
the
time
game
of
shortly
afterwards
he
appears
to
king
eochy
as
already
related
on
the
hill
of
tara
he
tells
the
king
that
he
has
come
to
play
a
game
of
chess
with
him
and
produces
a
chessboard
of
silver
with
pieces
of
gold
studded
with
jewels
to
be
a
skilful
was
a
necessary
accomplishment
of
kings
and
nobles
in
ireland
and
eochy
enters
into
the
game
with
zest
midir
allows
him
to
win
game
after
game
and
in
payment
for
his
losses
he
performs
by
magic
all
kinds
of
tasks
for
eochy
reclaiming
land
clearing
forests
and
building
causeways
across
we
have
a
touch
of
the
popular
conception
of
the
danaans
as
earth
deities
associated
with
agriculture
and
fertility
at
last
having
excited
eochy
s
cupidity
and
made
him
believe
himself
the
better
player
he
proposes
a
final
game
the
stakes
to
be
at
the
pleasure
of
the
victor
after
the
game
is
over
eochy
is
now
defeated
my
stake
is
forfeit
to
thee
said
eochy
had
i
wished
it
it
had
been
forfeit
long
ago
said
midir
what
is
it
that
thou
desirest
me
to
grant
said
eochy
that
i
may
hold
etain
in
my
arms
and
obtain
a
kiss
from
her
said
midir
the
king
was
silent
for
a
while
then
he
said
one
month
from
thou
shalt
come
and
the
thing
thou
desirest
shall
be
granted
and
eochy
s
mind
foreboded
evil
and
when
the
appointed
day
came
he
caused
the
palace
of
tara
to
be
surrounded
by
a
great
host
of
armed
men
to
keep
midir
out
all
was
in
vain
however
as
the
king
sat
at
the
feast
while
etain
handed
round
the
wine
midir
more
glorious
than
ever
suddenly
stood
in
their
midst
holding
his
spears
in
his
left
hand
he
threw
his
right
around
etain
and
the
couple
rose
lightly
in
the
air
and
disappeared
through
a
in
the
palace
angry
and
bewildered
the
king
and
his
warriors
rushed
out
of
doors
but
all
they
could
see
was
two
white
swans
that
circled
in
the
air
above
the
palace
and
then
departed
in
long
steady
flight
towards
the
fairy
mountain
of
slievenamon
and
thus
queen
etain
rejoined
her
kindred
with
eochy
however
would
not
accept
defeat
and
now
ensues
what
i
think
is
the
earliest
recorded
war
with
fairyland
since
the
first
dispossession
of
the
danaans
after
searching
ireland
for
his
wife
in
vain
he
summoned
to
his
aid
the
druid
dalan
dalan
tried
for
a
year
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
find
out
where
she
was
at
last
he
made
what
seems
to
have
been
an
operation
of
wizardry
of
special
he
made
three
wands
of
yew
and
upon
the
wands
he
wrote
an
ogham
and
by
the
keys
of
wisdom
that
he
had
and
by
the
ogham
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
etain
was
in
the
fairy
mound
of
and
that
midir
had
borne
her
eochy
then
assembled
his
forces
to
storm
and
destroy
the
fairy
mound
in
which
was
the
palace
of
midir
it
is
said
that
he
was
nine
years
digging
up
one
mound
after
another
while
midir
and
his
folk
repaired
the
devastation
as
fast
as
it
was
made
at

one
of

us
for
the

to
the

institution

plays
henceforward
a
very
important
part
in
irish
legend
the

observance
of

must
therefore
delay
a

doubtless
an

they
were

from

married
cormac

she
bore
her
husband
no
children
save
one
daughter
only
embittered
by
her
barrenness
and
his
want
of
an
heir
the
king
put
away
etain
and
ordered
her
infant
to
be
abandoned
and
thrown
into
a
pit
then
his
two
thralls
take
her
to
a
pit
and
she
smiles
a
laughing
smile
at
them
as
they
were
putting
her
into
after
that
they
can
not
leave
her
to
die
and
they
carry
her
to
a
cowherd
of
eterskel
king
of
tara
by
whom
she
is
fostered
and
taught
till
she
became
a
good
embroidress
and
there
was
not
in

a
king

daughter
dearer

hence
the

she
bore

which
means
the

for
fear
of
her
being
discovered
the
cowherds
keep
the
maiden
in
a
house
of

having
only
a

one
of
king
eterskel
s
folk
has
the
curiosity
to
climb
up
and
look
in
and
sees
there
the
fairest
maiden
in
ireland
he
bears
word
to
the
king
who
orders
an
opening
to
be
made
in
the
wall
and
the
maiden
fetched
forth
for
the
king
was
childless
and
it
had
been
prophesied
to
him
by
his
druid
that
a
woman
of
unknown
race
would
bear
him
a
son
then
said
the
king
this
is
the
woman
that
has
been
prophesied
to
and
birth
of
before
her
release
however
she
is
visited
by
a
denizen
from
the
land
of
youth
a
great
bird
comes
down
through
her
on
the
floor
of
the
hut
his
falls
from
him
and
reveals
a
glorious
youth
like
danaë
like
leda
like
ethlinn
daughter
of
balor
she
gives
her
love
to
the
god
ere
they
part
he
tells
her
that
she
will
be
taken
to
the
king
but
that
she
will
bear
to
her
danaan
lover
a
son
whose
name
shall
be
conary
and
that
it
shall
be
forbidden
to
him
to
go
after
birds
so
conary
was
born
and
grew
up
into
a
wise
and
noble
youth
and
he
was
fostered
with
a
lord
named
desa
whose
three
grew
up
with
him
from
childhood
their
names
were
ferlee
and
fergar
and
ferrogan

conary
it
is
said
loved
them
well
and
taught
them
his
wisdom
the
high
then
king
eterskel
died
and
a
successor
had
to
be
appointed
in
ireland
the
eldest
son
did
not
succeed
to
the
throne
or
chieftaincy
as
a
matter
of
right
but
the
ablest
and
best
of
the
family
at
the
time
was
supposed
to
be
selected
by
the
clan
in
this
tale
we
have
a
curious
account
of
this
selection
by
means
of
divination
a
was
a
bull
was
slain
and
the
diviner
would
eat
his
fill
and
drink
its
broth
then
he
went
to
bed
where
a
spell
was
chanted
over
him
whoever
he
saw
in
his
dream
would
be
king
so
at
ægira
in
achæa
as
whitley
stokes
points
out
the
priestess
of
earth
drank
the
fresh
blood
of
a
bull
before
descending
into
the
cave
to
prophesy
the
dreamer
cried
in
his
sleep
that
he
saw
a
naked
man
going
towards
tara
with
a
stone
in
his
sling
the
was
held
at
tara
but
conary
was
then
with
his
three
playing
a
game
on
the
plains
of
liffey
they
separated
conary
going
towards
dublin
where
he
saw
before
him
a
flock
of
great
birds
wonderful
in
colour
and
beauty
he
drove
after
them
in
his
chariot
but
the
birds
would
go
a
in
front
and
light
and
fly
on
again
never
letting
him
come
up
with
them
till
they
reached
the
then
he
lighted
down
from
his
chariot
and
took
out
his
sling
to
cast
at
them
whereupon
they
changed
into
armed
men
and
turned
on
him
with
spears
and
swords
one
of
them
however
protected
him
and
said
i

entered
upon
his
reign
which
was
marked
by
the
fair
seasons
and
bounteous
harvests
always
associated
in
the
irish

with
the
reign
of
a
good
king

of
the
disturbance
however
came
from
another
source
conary
had
put
down
all

and
rapine
and
his
three
who
were
born
reavers
took
it
ill
they
pursued
their
evil
ways
in
pride
and
wilfulness
and
were
at

captured
conary
would
not
condemn
them
to
death
as
the
people
begged
him
to
do
but
spared
them
for
the
sake
of
his
kinship
in
fosterage
they
were
however
banished
from
erin
and
bidden
to
go
raiding
overseas
if

they
must
on

met
another
exiled
chief

the
son
of

joining
forces
with
him
they
attacked
the
fortress
in

ingcel

father
mother
and
brothers
were
guests
at
the
time
and
all
were
destroyed
in
a
single
night
it
was
then
the
turn
of
ingcel
to
ask
their
help
in
raiding
the
land
of
erin
and
gathering
a
host
of
other
outlawed
men
including
the
seven

lured
by

a

between
two
of
his

travelling
back
to

they
see
the
country
around
it
lit
with
the
glare
of
fires
and
wrapped
in
clouds
of

from

conary

have
to
turn
round

then
round
the
plain
of

but
the
smoke
and

were
an
illusion
made
by
the
fairy
folk
who
are
now
drawing
the

closer
round
the
doomed
king
on
his
way
past

chases
the
evil
beasts
of
cerna

but
he
saw
it
not
till
the
chase
was
derga
s
hostel
and
the
three
conary
had
now
to
find
a
for
the
night
and
he
recollects
that
he
is
not
far
from
the
hostel
of
the
leinster
lord
da
derga
which
gives
its
name
to
this
bardic
tale
conary
had
been
generous
to
him
when
da
derga
came
visiting
to

and
he
determined
to
seek
his
hospitality
for
the
night
da
derga
dwelt
in
a
vast
hall
with
seven
doors
near
to
the
present
town
of
dublin
probably
at
donnybrook
on
the
to
the
south
as
the

are
journeying
thither
an
ominous
incident
marks
in
front
of
them
on
the
road
three
horsemen
clad
all
in
red
and
riding
on
red
horses
he
remembers
his
about
the
three
reds
and
sends
a
messenger
forward
to
bid
them
fall
behind
but
however
the
messenger
lashes
his
horse
he
fails
to
get
nearer
than
the
length
of
a
to
the
three
red
riders
he
shouts
to
them
to
turn
back
and
follow
the
king
but
one
of
them
looking
over
his
shoulder
bids
him
ironically
look
out
for
great
news
from
a
again
and
again
the
messenger
is
sent
to
them
with
promises
of
great
reward
if
they
will
fall
behind
instead
of
preceding
conary
at
last
one
of
them
chants
a
mystic
and
terrible
strain
lo
my

the
news
weary
are
the

they
ride
forward

alighting
from

fasten
them
at

of

sit
down

therefore
been

red
horsemen
to
the
house

all
my

remarks
forebodingly
have
seized
me
of
the
from
this
point
the
story
of
conary
mōr
takes
on
a
character
of
supernatural
vastness
and
mystery
the
imagination
of
the
bardic
narrator
dilating
as
it
were
with
the
approach
of
the
crisis
night
has
fallen
and
the
pirate
host
of
ingcel
is
encamped
on
the

of

hear
the

royal
cavalcade
and
a

is
sent
out
to
discover
what
it
is
he
brings
back
word
of
the
glittering
and
multitudinous
host
which
has
followed
conary
to
the

a
crashing
noise

ingcel
reminds
them
of

them
the

they
can
not
refuse
to
stand
by
him
in
the
attack

meditates
on
conary
in
the

a
glare
of
the
fire
lit
by

now
perceived
by
the
pirate

shining
through
the

are
drawn
up
around
the
open
doors
of
the

another
of

and
his

now
proceed
to
build
a

cairn
of

contributing
one

so
that

may
be
a

removes

mac

i

there
says
the

for
horror
and

he
persuades
her
to
come
and
says
i

not
whether
it
is
a

or
gnat
or
an
ant
that
nips
me
in
the
the
woman
looked
and
saw
a
hairy
wolf
buried
as
far
as
the
two
shoulders
in
the
wound
she
seized
it
by
the
tail
and
dragged
it
forth
and
it
took
the
full

its
jaws
out
of

says
the
woman
this
is
an
ant
of

mac
cecht
took
it
by

throat
and
smote
it
on
the
forehead
so
that
it
died

the
tale
ends
in
a
truly
heroic
strain

of
the
centre
of
interest
in
irish
legend
now
shifts
from
tara
to
ulster
and
a
multitude
of
heroic
tales
gather
round
the
ulster
king
conor
mac
nessa
round
cuchulain
his
great
vassal
and
the
red
branch
order
of
chivalry
which
had
its
seat
in
emain
macha
the
legend
of
the
foundation
of
emain
macha
has
already
been
told
but
macha
who
was
no
mere
woman
but
a
supernatural
being
appears
again
in
connexion
with
the
history
of
ulster
in
a
very
curious
tale
which
was
supposed
to
account
for
the
strange
debility
or
helplessness
that
at
critical
moments
sometimes
fell
it
was
believed
upon
the
warriors
of
the
province
the
legend
tells
that
a
wealthy
ulster
farmer
named
crundchu
son
of
agnoman
dwelling
in
a
solitary
place
among
the
hills
found
one
day
in
his
dūn
a
young
woman
of
great
beauty
and
in
splendid
array
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
crundchu
we
are
told
was
a
widower
his
wife
having
died
after
bearing
him
four
sons
the
strange
woman
without
a
word
set
herself
to
do
the
houshold
tasks
prepared
dinner
milked
the
cow
and
took
on
herself
all
the
duties
of
the
mistress
of
the
household
at
night
she
lay
down
at
crundchu
s
side
and
thereafter
dwelt
with
him
as
his
wife
and
they
loved
each
other
dearly
her
name
was
macha
one
day
crundchu
prepared
himself
to
go
to
a
great
fair
or
assembly
of
the
ultonians
where
there
would
be
feasting
and
tournaments
and
music
and
merrymaking
of
all
kinds
macha
begged
her
husband
not
to
go
he
persisted
then
she
said
at
least
do
not
speak
of
me
in
the
assembly
for
i
may
dwell
with
you
only
so
long
as
i
am
not
spoken
it
has
been
observed
that
we
have
here
the
earliest
appearance
in
european
literature
of
the
motive
of
the
fairy
bride
who
can
stay
with
her
mortal
lover
only
so
long
as
certain
conditions
are
observed
such
as
that
he
shall
not
spy
upon
her
her
or
ask
of
her
origin
crundchu
promised
to
obey
the
injunction
and
went
to
the
festival
here
the
two
horses
of
the
king
carried
off
prize
after
prize
in
the
racing
and
the
people
cried
there
is
not
in
ireland
a
swifter
than
the
king
s
pair
of
i
have
a
wife
at
home
said
crundchu
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
who
can
run
quicker
than
these
seize
that
man
said
the
angry
king
and
hold
him
till
his
wife
be
brought
to
the
so
messengers
went
for
macha
and
she
was
brought
before
the
assembly
and
she
was
with
child
the
king
bade
her
prepare
for
the
race
she
pleaded
her
condition
i
am
close
upon
my
hour
she
said
then
hew
her
man
in
pieces
said
the
king
to
his
guards
macha
turned
to
the
bystanders
help
me
she
cried
for
a
mother
hath
borne
each
of
you
give
me
but
a
short
delay
till
i
am
but
the
king
and
all
the
crowd
in
their
savage
lust
for
sport
would
hear
of
no
delay
then
bring
up
the
horses
said
macha
and
because
you
have
no
pity
a
heavier
infamy
shall
fall
upon
so
she
raced
against
the
horses
and
outran
them
but
as
she
came
to
the
goal
she
gave
a
great
cry
and
her
travail
seized
her
and
she
gave
birth
to
twin
children
as
she
uttered
that
cry
however
all
the
spectators
felt
themselves
seized
with
pangs
like
her
own
and
had
no
more
strength
than
a
woman
in
her
travail
and
macha
prophesied
from
this
hour
the
shame
you
have
wrought
on
me
will
fall
upon
each
man
of
ulster
in
the
hours
of
your
greatest
need
ye
shall
be
weak
and
helpless
as
women
in
childbirth
and
this
shall
endure
for
five
days
and
four
the
ninth
generation
the
curse
shall
be
upon
and
so
it
came
to
pass
and
this
is
the
cause
of
the
debility
of
the
ultonians
that
was
wont
to
afflict
the
warriors
of
the
province
mac
the
chief
occasion
on
which
this
debility
was
manifested
was
when
maev
queen
of
connacht
made
the
famous
of
quelgny
bo
which
forms
the
subject
of
the
greatest
tale
in
irish
literature
we
have
now
to
relate
the
preliminary
history
leading
up
to
this
epic
tale
and
introducing
its
chief
characters
fachtna
the
giant
king
of
ulster
had
to
wife
nessa
daughter
of
echid
and
she
bore
him
a
son
named
conor
but
when
fachtna
died
fergus
son
of
roy
his
succeeded
him
conor
being
then
but
a
youth
now
fergus
loved
nessa
and
would
have
wedded
her
but
she
made
conditions
let
my
son
conor
reign
one
year
she
said
so
that
his
posterity
may
be
the
descendants
of
a
king
and
i
fergus
agreed
and
young
conor
took
the
throne
but
so
wise
and
prosperous
was
his
rule
and
so
sagacious
his
judgments
that
at
the
year
s
end
the
people
as
nessa
foresaw
would
have
him
remain
king
and
fergus
who
loved
the
feast
and
the
chase
better
than
the
toils
of
kingship
was
content
to
have
it
so
and
remained
at
conor
s
court
for
a
time
great
honoured
and
happy
but
king
no
longer
red
in
his
time
was
the
glory
of
the
red
branch
in
ulster
who
were
the
offspring
of
ross
the
red
king
of
ulster
with
collateral
relatives
and
allies
forming
ultimately
a
kind
of
warlike
order
most
of
the
red
branch
heroes
appear
in
the
ultonian
cycle
of
legend
so
that
a
statement
of
their
names
and
relationships
may
be
usefully
placed
here
before
we
proceed
to
speak
of
their
doings
it
is
noticeable
that
they
have
a
partly
supernatural
ancestry
ross
the
red
it
is
said
wedded
a
danaan
woman
maga
daughter
of
angus
ōg
as
a
second
wife
he
wedded
a
maiden
named
roy
his
descendants
are
as
follows
maga
ross
the
red
roy
fachtna
nessa
fergus
mac
roy
the
giant
conor
mac
nessa
but
maga
was
also
wedded
to
the
druid
cathbad
and
by
him
had
three
daughters
whose
descendants
played
a
notable
part
in
the
ultonian
legendary
cycle
cathbad
maga
dectera
lugh
elva
usna
finchoom
amorgin
cuchulain
naisi
ainlé
ardan
conall
of
the
victories
dectera
also
had
a
mortal
husband
sualtam
who
passed
as
cuchulain
s
father
of
it
was
during
the
reign
of
conor
mac
nessa
that
the
birth
of
the
mightiest
hero
of
the
celtic
race
cuchulain
came
about
and
this
was
the
manner
of
it
the
maiden
dectera
daughter
of
cathbad
with
fifty
young
girls
her
companions
at
the
court
of
conor
one
day
disappeared
and
for
three
years
no
searching
availed
to
discover
their
or
their
fate
at
last
one
summer
day
a
flock
of
birds
descended
on
the
fields
about
emain
macha
and
began
to
destroy
the
crops
and
fruit
the
king
with
fergus
and
others
of
his
nobles
went
out
against
them
with
slings
but
the
birds
flew
only
a
little
way
off
luring
the
party
on
and
on
till
at
last
they
found
themselves
near
the
fairy
mound
of
angus
on
the
river
boyne
night
fell
and
the
king
sent
fergus
with
a
party
to
discover
some
habitation
where
they
might
sleep
a
hut
was
found
where
they
betook
themselves
to
rest
but
one
of
them
exploring
further
came
to
a
noble
mansion
by
the
river
and
on
entering

the
part
of
ulster
from

southward
to

allotted
for
his
inheritance
and
in
later
days

was
in

is
said
that
the
druid

when

enough
the
boy

went
to
the
court
of
conor
to
be
brought
up
and
instructed
along
with
the
other
sons
of
princes
and
chieftains
it
was
now
that
the
event
occurred
from
which
he
got
the
name
of
cuchulain
by
which
he
was
hereafter
to
be
known
one
afternoon
king
conor
and
his
nobles
were
going
to
a
feast
to
which
they
were
bidden
at
the
dūn
of
a
wealthy
smith
named
cullan
in
quelgny
where
they
also
meant
to
spend
the
night
setanta
was
to
accompany
them
but
as
the
cavalcade
set
off
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
game
of
hurley
with
his
companions
and
bade
the
king
go
forward
saying
he
would
follow
later
when
his
play
was
done
the
royal
company
arrived
at
their
destination
as
night
began
to
fall
cullan
received
them
hospitably
and
in
the
great
hall
they
made
merry
over
meat
and
wine
while
the
lord
of
the
house
barred
the
gates
of
his
fortress
and
let
loose
outside
a
huge
and
ferocious
dog
which
every
night
guarded
the
lonely
mansion
and
under
whose
protection
it
was
said
cullan
feared
nothing
less
than
the
onset
of
an
army
but
they
had
forgotten
setanta
in
the
middle
of
the
laughter
and
music
of
the
feast
a
terrible
sound
was
heard
which
brought
every
man
to
his
feet
in
an
instant
it
was
the
tremendous
baying
of
the
hound
of
cullan
giving
tongue
as
it
saw
a
stranger
approach
soon
the
noise
changed
to
the
howls
of
a
fierce
combat
but
on
rushing
to
the
gates
they
saw
in
the
glare
of
the
lanterns
a
young
boy
and
the
hound
lying
dead
at
his
feet
when
it
flew
at
him
he
had
seized
it
by
the
throat
and
dashed
its
life
out
against
the
of
the
gate
the
warriors
bore
in
the
lad
with
rejoicing
and
wonder
but
soon
the
triumph
ceased
for
there
stood
their
host
silent
and
sorrowful
over
the
body
of
his
faithful
friend
who
had
died
for
the
safety
of
his
house
and
would
never
guard
it
more
give
me
then
said
the
lad
setanta
a
whelp
of
that
hound
o
cullan
and
i
will
train
him
to
be
all
to
you
that
his
sire
was
and
until
then
give
me
shield
and
spear
and
i
will
myself
guard
your
house
never
hound
guarded
it
better
than
i
and
all
the
company
shouted
applause
at
the
generous
pledge
and
on
the
spot
as
a
commemoration
of
his
first
deed
of
valour
they
named
the
lad
cuchulain
the
hound
of
cullan
and
by
that
name
he
was
known
until
he
died
assumes
when
he
was
older
and
near
the
time
when
he
might
assume
the
weapons
of
manhood
it
chanced
one
day
that
he
passed
close
by
where
cathbad
the
druid
was
teaching
to
certain
of
his
pupils
the
art
of
divination
and
augury
one
of
them
asked
of
cathbad
for
what
kind
of
enterprise
that
same
day
might
be
favourable
and
cathbad
having
worked
a
spell
of
divination
said
the
youth
who
should
take
up
arms
on
this
day
would
become
of
all
men
in
erin
most
famous
for
great
deeds
yet
will
his
life
be
short
and
cuchulain
passed
on
as
though
he
marked
it
not
and
he
came
before
the
king
what
wilt
thou
asked
conor
to
take
the
arms
of
manhood
said
cuchulain
so
be
it
said
the
king
and
he
gave
the
lad
two
great
spears
but
cuchulain
shook
them
in
his
hand
and
the
staves
splintered
and
broke
and
so
he
did
with
many
others
and
the
chariots
in
which
they
set
him
to
drive
he
broke
to
pieces
with
stamping
of
his
foot
until
at
last
the
king
s
own
chariot
of
war
and
his
two
spears
and
sword
were
brought
to
the
lad
and
these
he
could
not
break
do
what
he
would
so
this
equipment
he
retained
courtship
of
the
young
cuchulain
was
by
this
grown
so
fair
and
noble
a
youth
that
every
maid
or
matron
on
whom
he
looked
was
bewitched
by
him
and
the
men
of
ulster
bade
him
take
a
wife
of
his
own
but
none
were
pleasing
to
him
till
at
last
he
saw
the
lovely
maiden
emer
daughter
of
forgall
the
lord
of
lusca
and
he
resolved
to
woo
her
for
his
bride
so
he
bade
harness
his
chariot
and
with
laeg
his
friend
and
charioteer
he
journeyed
to
dūn
forgall
as
he
drew
near
the
maiden
was
with
her
companions
daughters
of
the
vassals
of
forgall
and
she
was
teaching
them
embroidery
for
in
that
art
she
excelled
all
women
she
had
the
six
gifts
of
gift
of
beauty
the
gift
of
voice
the
gift
of
sweet
speech
the
gift
of
needlework
the
gift
of
wisdom
and
the
gift
of
hearing
the
thunder
of
and
the
clangour
of
the
chariot
from
afar
she
bade
one
of
the
maidens
go
to
the
rampart
of
the
dūn
and
tell
her
what
she
saw
a
chariot
is
coming
on
said
the
maiden
drawn
by
two
steeds
with
tossing
heads
fierce
and
powerful
one
is
grey
the
other
black
they
breathe
fire
from
their
jaws
and
the
clods
of
turf
they
throw
up
behind
them
as
they
race
are
like
a
flock
of
birds
that
follow
in
their
track
in
the
chariot
is
a
dark
sad
man
comeliest
of
the
men
of
erin
he
is
clad
in
a
crimson
cloak
with
a
brooch
of
gold
and
on
his
back
is
a
crimson
shield
with
a
silver
rim
wrought
with
figures
of
beasts
with
him
as
his
charioteer
is
a
tall
slender
freckled
man
with
curling
red
hair
held
by
a
fillet
of
bronze
with
plates
of
gold
at
either
side
of
his
face
with
a
goad
of
red
gold
he
urges
the
when
the
chariot
drew
up
emer
went
to
meet
cuchulain
and
saluted
him
but
when
he
urged
his
love
upon
her
she
told
him
of
the
might
and
the
wiliness
of
her
father
forgall
and
of
the
strength
of
the
champions
that
guarded
her
lest
she
should
wed
against
his
will
and
when
he
pressed
her
more
she
said
i
may
not
marry
before
my
sister
fial
who
is
older
than
i
she
is
with
me
is
excellent
in
it
is
not
fial
whom
i
love
said
cuchulain
then
as
they
were
conversing
he
saw
the
breast
of
the
maiden
over
the
bosom
of
her
smock
and
said
to
her
fair
is
this
plain
the
plain
of
the
noble
none
comes
to
this
plain
said
she
who
has
not
slain
his
hundreds
and
thy
deeds
are
still
to
so
cuchulain
then
left
her
and
drove
back
to
emain
macha
in
the
land
of
next
day
cuchulain
bethought
himself
how
he
could
prepare
himself
for
war
and
for
the
deeds
of
heroism
which
emer
had
demanded
of
him
now
he
had
heard
of
a
mighty
named
skatha
who
dwelt
in
the
land
of
shadows
and
who
could
teach
to
young
heroes
who
came
to
her
wonderful
feats
of
arms
so
cuchulain
went
overseas
to
find
her
and
many
dangers
he
had
to
meet
black
forests
and
desert
plains
to
traverse
before
he
could
get
tidings
of
skatha
and
her
land
at
last
he
came
to
the
plain
of
where
he
could
not
cross
without
being
mired
in
its
bottomless
bogs
or
sticky
clay
and
while
he
was
debating
what
he
should
do
he
saw
coming
towards
him
a
young
man
with
a
face
that
shone
like
the
sun
and
whose
very
look
put
cheerfulness
and
hope
into
his
heart
the
young
man
gave
him
a
wheel
and
told
him
to
roll
it
before
him
on
the
plain
and
to
follow
it
whithersoever
it
went
so
cuchulain
set
the
wheel
rolling
and
as
it
went
it
blazed
with
light
that
shot
like
rays
from
its
rim
and
the
heat
of
it
made
a
firm
path
across
the
quagmire
where
cuchulain
followed
safely
when
he
had
passed
the
plain
of
and
escaped
the
beasts
of
the
perilous
glen
he
came
to
the
bridge
of
the
leaps
beyond
which
was
the
country
of
skatha
here
he
found
on
the
hither
side
many
sons
of
the
princes
of
ireland
who
were
come
to
learn
feats
of
war
from
skatha
and
they
were
playing
at
hurley
on
the
green
and
among
them
was
his
friend
ferdia
son
of
the
firbolg
daman
and
they
all
asked
him
of
the
news
from
ireland
when
he
had
told
them
all
he
asked
ferdia
how
he
should
pass
to
the
dūn
of
skatha
now
the
bridge
of
leaps
was
very
narrow
and
very
high
and
it
crossed
a
gorge
where
far
below
swung
the
tides
of
a
boiling
sea
in
which
ravenous
monsters
could
be
seen
swimming
not
one
of
us
has
crossed
that
bridge
said
ferdia
for
there
are
two
feats
that
skatha
teaches
last
and
one
is
the
leap
across
the
bridge
and
the
other
the
thrust
of
the
gae
bolg
for
if
a
man
step
upon
one
end
of
that
bridge
the
middle
straightway
rises
up
and
flings
him
back
and
if
he
leap
upon
it
he
may
chance
to
miss
his
footing
and
fall
into
the
gulf
where
the
are
waiting
for
but
cuchulain
waited
till
evening
when
he
had
recovered
his
strength
from
his
long
journey
and
then
essayed
the
crossing
of
the
bridge
three
times
he
ran
towards
it
from
a
distance
gathering
all
his
powers
together
and
strove
to
leap
upon
the
middle
but
three
times
it
rose
against
him
and
flung
him
back
while
his
companions
jeered
at
him
because
he
would
not
wait
for
the
help
of
skatha
but
at
the
fourth
leap
he
lit
fairly
on
the
centre
of
the
bridge
and
with
one
leap
more
he
was
across
it
and
stood
before
the
strong
fortress
of
skatha
and
she
wondered
at
his
courage
and
vigour
and
admitted
him
to
be
her
pupil
for
a
year
and
a
day
cuchulain
abode
with
skatha
and
all
the
feats
she
had
to
teach
he
learned
easily
and
last
of
all
she
taught
him
the
use
of
the
gae
bolg
and
gave
him
that
dreadful
weapon
which
she
had
deemed
no
champion
before
him
good
enough
to
have
and
the
manner
of
using
the
gae
bolg
was
that
it
was
thrown
with
the
foot
and
if
it
entered
an
enemy
s
body
it
filled
every
limb
and
crevice
of
him
with
its
barbs
while
cuchulain
dwelt
with
skatha
his
friend
above
all
friends
and
his
rival
in
skill
and
valour
was
ferdia
and
ere
they
parted
they
vowed
to
love
and
help
one
another
as
long
as
they
should
live
and
now
whilst
cuchulain
was
in
the
land
of
the
shadows
it
chanced
that
skatha
made
war
on
the
people
of
the
princess
aifa
who
was
the
fiercest
and
strongest
of
the
of
the
world
so
that
even
skatha
feared
to
meet
her
in
arms
on
going
forth
to
the
war
therefore
skatha
mixed
with
cuchulain
s
drink
a
sleepy
herb
so
that
he
should
not
wake
for
hours
by
which
time
the
host
would
be
far
on
its
way
for
she
feared
lest
evil
should
come
to
him
ere
he
had
got
his
full
strength
but
the
potion
that
would
have
served
another
man
for
a
day
and
a
night
only
held
cuchulain
for
one
hour
and
when
he
waked
up
he
seized
his
arms
and
followed
the
host
by
its
till
he
came
up
with
them
then
it
is
said
that
skatha
uttered
a
sigh
for
she
knew
that
he
would
not
be
restrained
from
the
war
when
the
armies
met
cuchulain
and
the
two
sons
of
skatha
wrought
great
deeds
on
the
foe
and
slew
six
of
the
mightiest
of
aifa
s
warriors
then
aifa
sent
word
to
skatha
and
challenged
her
to
single
combat
but
cuchulain
declared
that
he
would
meet
the
fair
fury
in
place
of
skatha
and
he
asked
first
of
all
what
were
the
things
she
most
valued
what
aifa
loves
most
said
skatha
are
her
two
horses
her
chariot
and
her
then
the
pair
met
in
single
combat
and
every
champion
s
feat
which
they
knew
they
tried
on
each
other
in
vain
till
at
last
a
blow
of
aifa
s
shattered
the
sword
of
cuchulain
to
the
hilt
at
this
cuchulain
cried
out
ah
me
behold
the
chariot
and
horses
of
aifa
fallen
into
the
glen
aifa
glanced
round
and
cuchulain
rushing
in
seized
her
round
the
waist
and
slung
her
over
his
shoulder
and
bore
her
back
to
the
camp
of
skatha
there
he
flung
her
on
the
ground
and
put
his
knife
to
her
throat
she
begged
for
her
life
and
cuchulain
granted
it
on
condition
that
she
made
a
lasting
peace
with
skatha
and
gave
hostages
for
her
fulfilment
of
the
pledge
to
this
she
agreed
and
cuchulain
and
she
became
not
only
friends
but
lovers
tragedy
of
cuchulain
and
before
cuchulain
left
the
land
of
shadows
he
gave
aifa
a
golden
ring
saying
that
if
she
should
bear
him
a
son
he
was
to
be
sent
to
seek
his
father
in
erin
so
soon
as
he
should
have
grown
so
that
his
finger
would
fit
the
ring
and
cuchulain
said
charge
him
under
that
he
shall
not
make
himself
known
that
he
never
turn
out
of
the
way
for
any
man
nor
ever
refuse
a
combat
and
be
his
name
called
in
later
years
it
is
narrated
that
one
day
when
king
conor
of
ulster
and
the
lords
of
ulster
were
at
a
festal
gathering
on
the
strand
of
the
footprints
they
saw
coming
towards
them
across
the
sea
a
little
boat
of
bronze
and
in
it
a
young
lad
with
gilded
oars
in
his
hands
in
the
boat
was
a
heap
of
stones
and
ever
and
anon
the
lad
would
put
one
of
these
stones
into
a
sling
and
cast
it
at
a
flying
in
such
fashion
that
it
would
bring
down
the
bird
alive
to
his
feet
and
many
other
wonderful
feats
of
skill
he
did
then
conor
said
as
the
boat
drew
nearer
if
the
grown
men
of
that
lad
s
country
came
here
they
would
surely
grind
us
to
powder
woe
to
the
land
into
which
that
boy
shall
come
when
the
boy
came
to
land
a
messenger
condery
was
sent
to
bid
him
be
off
i
will
not
turn
back
for
thee
said
the
lad
and
condery
repeated
what
he
had
said
to
the
king
then
conall
of
the
victories
was
sent
against
him
but
the
lad
slung
a
great
stone
at
him
and
the
whizz
and
wind
of
it
knocked
him
down
and
the
lad
sprang
upon
him
and
bound
his
arms
with
the
strap
of
his
shield
and
so
man
after
man
was
served
some
were
bound
and
some
were
slain
but
the
lad
defied
the
whole
power
of
ulster
to
turn
him
back
nor
would
he
tell
his
name
or
lineage
send
for
cuchulain
then
said
king
conor
and
they
sent
a
messenger
to
dundalk
where
cuchulain
was
with
emer
his
wife
and
bade
him
come
to
do
battle
against
a
stranger
boy
whom
conall
of
the
victories
could
not
overcome
emer
threw
her
arm
round
cuchulain
s
neck
do
not
go
she
entreated
surely
this
is
the
son
of
aifa
slay
not
thine
only
but
cuchulain
said
forbear
woman
were
it
connla
himself
i
would
slay
him
for
the
honour
of
ulster
and
he
bade
yoke
his
chariot
and
went
to
the
strand
here
he
found
the
boy
tossing
up
his
weapons
and
doing
marvellous
feats
with
them
delightful
is
thy
play
boy
said
cuchulain
who
art
thou
and
whence
dost
thou
come
i
may
not
reveal
that
said
the
lad
then
thou
shalt
die
said
cuchulain
so
be
it
said
the
lad
and
then
they
fought
with
swords
for
a
while
till
the
lad
delicately
shore
off
a
lock
of
cuchulain
s
hair
enough
of
trifling
said
cuchulain
and
they
closed
with
each
other
but
the
lad
planted
himself
on
a
rock
and
stood
so
firm
that
cuchulain
could
not
move
him
and
in
the
stubborn
wrestling
they
had
the
lad
s
two
feet
sank
deep
into
the
stone
and
made
the
footprints
whence
the
strand
of
the
footprints
has
its
name
at
last
they
both
fell
into
the
sea
and
cuchulain
was
near
being
drowned
till
he
bethought
himself
of
the
gae
bolg
and
he
drove
that
weapon
against
the
lad
and
it
ripped
up
his
belly
that
is
what
skatha
never
taught
me
cried
the
lad
woe
is
me
for
i
am
cuchulain
looked
at
him
and
saw
the
ring
on
his
finger
it
is
true
he
said
and
he
took
up
the
boy
and
bore
him
on
shore
and
laid
him
down
before
conor
and
the
lords
of
ulster
here
is
my
son
for
you
men
of
ulster
he
said
and
the
boy
said
it
is
true
and
if
i
had
five
years
to
grow
among
you
you
would
conquer
the
world
on
every
side
of
you
and
rule
as
far
as
rome
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
point
out
to
me
the
famous
warriors
that
are
here
that
i
may
know
them
and
take
leave
of
them
before
i
then
one
after
another
they
were
brought
to
him
and
he
kissed
them
and
took
leave
of
his
father
and
he
died
and
the
men
of
ulster
made
his
grave
and
set
up
his
with
great
mourning
this
was
the
only
son
cuchulain
ever
had
and
this
son
he
slew
this
tale
as
i
have
given
it
here
dates
from
the
ninth
century
and
is
found
in
the
yellow
book
of
there
are
many
other
gaelic
versions
of
it
in
poetry
and
prose
it
is
one
of
the
earliest
extant
appearances
in
literature
of
the
since
theme
of
the
slaying
of
a
heroic
son
by
his
father
the
persian
rendering
of
it
in
the
tale
of
sohrab
and
rustum
has
been
made
familiar
by
matthew
arnold
s
fine
poem
in
the
irish
version
it
will
be
noted
that
the
father
is
not
without
a
suspicion
of
the
identity
of
his
antagonist
but
he
does
battle
with
him
under
the
stimulus
of
that
passionate
sense
of
loyalty
to
his
prince
and
province
which
was
cuchulain
s
most
signal
characteristic
to
complete
the
story
of
aifa
and
her
son
we
have
anticipated
events
and
now
turn
back
to
take
up
the
thread
again
s
first
after
a
year
and
a
day
of
training
in
warfare
under
skatha
cuchulain
returned
to
erin
eager
to
test
his
prowess
and
to
win
emer
for
his
wife
so
he
bade
harness
his
chariot
and
drove
out
to
make
a
foray
upon
the
fords
and
marches
of
connacht
for
between
connacht
and
ulster
there
was
always
an
angry
surf
of
fighting
along
the
borders
and
first
he
drove
to
the
white
cairn
which
is
on
the
highest
of
the
mountains
of
mourne
and
surveyed
the
land
of
ulster
spread
out
smiling
in
the
sunshine
far
below
and
bade
his
charioteer
tell
him
the
name
of
every
hill
and
plain
and
dūn
that
he
saw
then
turning
southwards
he
looked
over
the
plains
of
bregia
and
the
charioteer
pointed
out
to
him
tara
and
teltin
and
brugh
na
boyna
and
the
great
dūn
of
the
sons
of
nechtan
are
they
asked
cuchulain
those
sons
of
nechtan
of
whom
it
is
said
that
more
of
the
men
of
ulster
have
fallen
by
their
hands
than
are
yet
living
on
the
earth
the
same
said
the
charioteer
then
let
us
drive
thither
said
cuchulain
so
much
unwilling
the
charioteer
drove
to
the
fortress
of
the
sons
of
nechtan
and
there
on
the
green
before
it
they
found
a
and
round
it
a
collar
of
bronze
having
on
it
writing
in
ogham
this
cuchulain
read
and
it
declared
that
any
man
of
age
to
bear
arms
who
should
come
to
that
green
should
hold
it
for
him
to
depart
without
having
challenged
one
of
the
dwellers
in
the
dūn
to
single
combat
then
cuchulain
flung
his
arms
round
the
stone
and
swaying
it
backwards
and
forwards
heaved
it
at
last
out
of
the
earth
and
flung
it
collar
and
all
into
the
river
that
ran
hard
by
surely
said
the
charioteer
thou
art
seeking
for
a
violent
death
and
now
thou
wilt
find
it
without
then
foill
son
of
nechtan
came
forth
from
the
dūn
and
seeing
cuchulain
whom
he
deemed
but
a
lad
he
was
annoyed
but
cuchulain
bade
him
fetch
his
arms
for
i
slay
not
drivers
nor
messengers
nor
unarmed
men
and
foill
went
back
into
the
dūn
thou
canst
not
slay
him
then
said
the
charioteer
for
he
is
invulnerable
by
magic
power
to
the
point
or
edge
of
any
but
cuchulain
put
in
his
sling
a
ball
of
tempered
iron
and
when
foill
appeared
he
slung
at
him
so
that
it
struck
his
forehead
and
went
clean
through
brain
and
skull
and
cuchulain
took
his
head
and
bound
it
to
his
and
other
sons
of
nechtan
issuing
forth
he
fought
with
and
slew
by
sword
or
spear
and
then
he
fired
the
dūn
and
left
it
in
a
blaze
and
drove
on
exultant
and
on
the
way
he
saw
a
flock
of
wild
swans
and
sixteen
of
them
he
brought
down
alive
with
his
sling
and
tied
them
to
the
chariot
and
seeing
a
herd
of
wild
deer
which
his
horses
could
not
overtake
he
lighted
down
and
chased
them
on
foot
till
he
caught
two
great
stags
and
with
thongs
and
ropes
he
made
them
fast
to
the
chariot
but
at
emain
macha
a
scout
of
king
conor
came
running
in
to
give
him
news
behold
a
solitary
chariot
is
approaching
swiftly
over
the
plain
wild
white
birds
flutter
round
it
and
wild
stags
are
tethered
to
it
it
is
decked
all
round
with
the
bleeding
heads
of
and
conor
looked
to
see
who
was
approaching
and
he
saw
that
cuchulain
was
in
his
and
would
deal
death
around
him
whomsoever
he
met
so
he
hastily
gave
order
that
a
troop
of
the
women
of
emania
should
go
forth
to
meet
him
and
having
stripped
off
their
clothing
should
stand
naked
in
the
way
this
they
did
and
when
the
lad
saw
them
smitten
with
shame
he
bowed
his
head
upon
the
then
conor
s
men
instantly
seized
him
and
plunged
him
into
a
vat
of
cold
water
which
had
been
made
ready
but
the
water
boiled
around
him
and
the
staves
and
hoops
of
the
vat
were
burst
asunder
this
they
did
again
and
yet
again
and
at
last
his
fury
left
him
and
his
natural
form
and
aspect
were
restored
then
they
clad
him
in
fresh
raiment
and
bade
him
in
to
the
feast
in
the
king
s
winning
of
next
day
he
went
to
the
dūn
of
forgall
the
wily
father
of
emer
and
he
leaped
the
hero
s
salmon
leap
that
he
had
learned
of
skatha
over
the
high
ramparts
of
the
dūn
then
the
mighty
men
of
forgall
set
on
him
and
he
dealt
but
three
blows
and
each
blow
slew
eight
men
and
forgall
himself
fell
lifeless
in
leaping
from
the
rampart
of
the
dūn
to
escape
cuchulain
so
he
carried
off
emer
and
her
and
two
loads
of
gold
and
silver
but
outside
the
dūn
the
sister
of
forgall
raised
a
host
against
him
and
his
came
on
him
and
furious
were
the
blows
he
dealt
so
that
the
ford
of
glondath
ran
blood
and
the
turf
on
crofot
was
trampled
into
bloody
mire
a
hundred
he
slew
at
every
ford
from
olbiny
to
the
boyne
and
so
was
emer
won
as
she
desired
and
he
brought
her
to
emain
macha
and
made
her
his
wife
and
they
were
not
parted
again
until
he
died
champion
of
a
lord
of
ulster
named
briccriu
of
the
poisoned
tongue
once
made
a
feast
to
which
he
bade
king
conor
and
all
the
heroes
of
the
red
branch
and
because
it
was
always
his
delight
to
stir
up
strife
among
men
or
women
he
set
the
heroes
contending
among
themselves
as
to
who
was
the
champion
of
the
land
of
erin
at
last
it
was
agreed
that
the
championship
must
lie
among
three
of
them
namely
cuchulain
and
conall
of
the
victories
and
laery
the
triumphant
to
decide
between
these
three
a
demon
named
the
terrible
was
summoned
from
a
lake
in
the
depth
of
which
he
dwelt
he
proposed
to
the
heroes
a
test
of
courage
any
one
of
them
he
said
might
cut
off
his
head
provided
that
he
the
claimant
of
the
championship
would
lay
down
his
own
head
for
the
axe
conall
and
laery
shrank
from
the
test
but
cuchulain
accepted
it
and
after
reciting
a
charm
over
his
sword
he
cut
off
the
head
of
the
demon
who
immediately
rose
and
taking
the
bleeding
head
in
one
hand
and
his
axe
in
the
other
plunged
into
the
lake
next
day
he
reappeared
whole
and
sound
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
the
bargain
cuchulain
quailing
but
resolute
laid
his
head
on
the
block
stretch
out
your
neck
wretch
cried
the
demon
tis
too
short
for
me
to
strike
cuchulain
does
as
he
is
bidden
the
demon
swings
his
axe
thrice
over
his
victim
brings
down
the
butt
with
a
crash
on
the
block
and
then
bids
cuchulain
rise
unhurt
champion
of
ireland
and
her
boldest
man
and
the
sons
of
we
have
now
to
turn
to
a
story
in
which
cuchulain
takes
no
part
it
is
the
chief
of
the
preliminary
tales
to
the
of
quelgny
there
was
among
the
lords
of
ulster
it
is
said
one
named
felim
son
of
dall
who
on
a
certain
day
made
a
great
feast
for
the
king
and
the
king
came
with
his
druid
cathbad
and
fergus
mac
roy
and
many
heroes
of
the
red
branch
and
while
they
were
making
merry
over
the
roasted
flesh
and
wheaten
cakes
and
greek
wine
a
messenger
from
the
women
s
apartments
came
to
tell
felim
that
his
wife
had
just
borne
him
a
daughter
so
all
the
lords
and
warriors
drank
health
to
the
infant
and
the
king
bade
cathbade
perform
divination
in
the
manner
of
the
druids
and
foretell
what
the
future
would
have
in
store
for
felim
s
babe
cathbad
gazed
upon
the
stars
and
drew
the
horoscope
of
the
child
and
he
was
much
troubled
and
at
length
he
said
the
infant
shall
be
fairest
among
the
women
of
erin
and
shall
wed
a
king
but
because
of
her
shall
death
and
ruin
come
upon
the
province
of
then
the
warriors
would
have
put
her
to
death
upon
the
spot
but
conor
forbade
them
i
will
avert
the
doom
he
said
for
she
shall
wed
no
foreign
king
but
she
shall
be
my
own
mate
when
she
is
of
so
he
took
away
the
child
and
committed
it
to
his
nurse
levarcam
and
the
name
they
gave
it
was
deirdre
and
conor
charged
levarcam
that
the
child
should
be
brought
up
in
a
strong
dūn
in
the
solitude
of
a
great
wood
and
that
no
young
man
should
see
her
or
she
him
until
she
was
of
marriageable
age
for
the
king
to
and
there
she
dwelt
seeing
none
but
her
nurse
and
cathbad
and
sometimes
the
king
now
growing
an
aged
man
who
would
visit
the
dūn
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
well
with
the
folk
there
and
that
his
commands
were
observed
one
day
when
the
time
for
the
marriage
of
deirdre
and
conor
was
drawing
near
deirdre
and
levarcam
looked
over
the
rampart
of
their
dūn
it
was
winter
a
heavy
snow
had
fallen
in
the
night
and
in
the
still
frosty
air
the
trees
stood
up
as
if
wrought
in
silver
and
the
green
before
the
dūn
was
a
sheet
of
unbroken
white
save
that
in
one
place
a
scullion
had
killed
a
calf
for
their
dinner
and
the
blood
of
the
calf
lay
on
the
snow
and
as
deirdre
looked
a
raven
lit
down
from
a
tree
hard
by
and
began
to
sip
the
blood
o
nurse
cried
deirdre
suddenly
such
and
not
like
conor
would
be
the
man
that
i
would
hair
like
the
raven
s
wing
and
in
his
cheek
the
hue
of
blood
and
his
skin
as
white
as
thou
hast
pictured
a
man
of
conor
s
household
said
the
nurse
who
is
he
asked
deirdre
he
is
naisi
son
of
usna
a
champion
of
the
red
branch
said
the
nurse
thereupon
deirdre
entreated
levarcam
to
bring
her
to
speak
with
naisi
and
because
the
old
woman
loved
the
girl
and
would
not
have
her
wedded
to
the
aged
king
she
at
last
agreed
deirdre
implored
naisi
to
save
her
from
conor
but
he
would
not
till
at
last
her
entreaties
and
her
beauty
won
him
and
he
vowed
to
be
hers
then
secretly
one
night
he
came
with
his
two
brethren
ardan
and
ainlé
and
bore
away
deirdre
with
levarcam
and
they
escaped
the
king
s
pursuit
and
took
ship
for
scotland
where
naisi
took
service
with
the
king
of
the
picts
yet
here
they
could
not
rest
for
the
king
got
sight
of
deirdre
and
would
have
taken
her
from
naisi
but
naisi
with
his
brothers
escaped
and
in
the
solitude
of
glen
etive
they
made
their
dwelling
by
the
lake
and
there
lived
in
the
wild
wood
by
hunting
and
fishing
seeing
no
man
but
themselves
and
their
servants
and
the
years
went
by
and
conor
made
no
sign
but
he
did
not
forget
and
his
spies
told
him
of
all
that
befell
naisi
and
deirdre
at
last
judging
that
naisi
and
his
brothers
would
have
tired
of
solitude
he
sent
the
bosom
friend
of
naisi
fergus
son
of
roy
to
bid
them
return
and
to
promise
them
that
all
would
be
forgiven
fergus
went
joyfully
and
joyfully
did
naisi
and
his
brothers
hear
the
message
but
deirdre
foresaw
evil
and
would
fain
have
sent
fergus
home
alone
but
naisi
blamed
her
for
her
doubt
and
suspicion
and
bade
her
mark
that
they
were
under
the
protection
of
fergus
whose
safeguard
no
king
in
ireland
would
dare
to
violate
and
they
at
last
made
ready
to
go
on
landing
in
ireland
they
were
met
by
baruch
a
lord
of
the
red
branch
who
had
his
dūn
close
by
and
he
bade
fergus
to
a
feast
he
had
prepared
for
him
that
night
i
may
not
stay
said
fergus
for
i
must
first
convey
deirdre
and
the
sons
of
usna
safely
to
emain
nevertheless
said
baruch
thou
must
stay
with
me
for
it
is
a
for
thee
to
refuse
a
deirdre
implored
him
not
to
leave
them
but
fergus
was
tempted
by
the
feast
and
feared
to
break
his
and
he
bade
his
two
sons
illan
the
fair
and
buino
the
red
take
charge
of
the
party
in
his
place
and
he
himself
abode
with
baruch
and
so
the
party
came
to
emain
macha
and
they
were
lodged
in
the
house
of
the
red
branch
but
conor
did
not
receive
them
after
the
evening
meal
as
he
sat
drinking
heavily
and
silently
he
sent
a
messenger
to
bid
levarcam
come
before
him
how
is
it
with
the
sons
of
usna
he
said
to
her
it
is
well
she
said
thou
hast
got
the
three
most
valorous
champions
in
ulster
in
thy
court
truly
the
king
who
has
those
three
need
fear
no
is
it
well
with
deirdre
he
asked
she
is
well
said
the
nurse
but
she
has
lived
many
years
in
the
wildwood
and
toil
and
care
have
changed
of
her
beauty
of
old
now
remains
to
her
o
then
the
king
dismissed
her
and
sat
drinking
again
but
after
a
while
he
called
to
him
a
servant
named
trendorn
and
bade
him
go
to
the
red
branch
house
and
mark
who
was
there
and
what
they
did
but
when
trendorn
came
the
place
was
bolted
and
barred
for
the
night
and
he
could
not
get
an
entrance
and
at
last
he
mounted
on
a
ladder
and
looked
in
at
a
high
window
and
there
he
saw
the
brothers
of
naisi
and
the
sons
of
fergus
as
they
talked
or
cleaned
their
arms
or
made
them
ready
for
slumber
and
there
sat
naisi
with
a
before
him
and
playing
chess
with
him
was
the
fairest
of
women
that
he
had
ever
seen
but
as
he
looked
in
wonder
at
the
noble
pair
suddenly
one
caught
sight
of
him
and
rose
with
a
cry
pointing
to
the
face
at
the
window
and
naisi
looked
up
and
saw
it
and
seizing
a
chessman
from
the
board
he
hurled
it
at
the
face
of
the
spy
and
it
struck
out
his
eye
then
trendorn
hastily
descended
and
went
back
with
his
bloody
face
to
the
king
i
have
seen
them
he
cried
i
have
seen
the
fairest
woman
of
the
world
and
but
that
naisi
had
struck
my
eye
out
i
had
been
looking
on
her
then
conor
arose
and
called
for
his
guards
and
bade
them
bring
the
sons
of
usna
before
him
for
maiming
his
messenger
and
the
guards
went
but
first
buino
son
of
fergus
with
his
retinue
met
them
and
at
the
sword
s
point
drove
them
back
but
naisi
and
deirdre
continued
quietly
to
play
chess
for
said
naisi
it
is
not
seemly
that
we
should
seek
to
defend
ourselves
while
we
are
under
the
protection
of
the
sons
of
but
conor
went
to
buino
and
with
a
great
gift
of
lands
he
bought
him
over
to
desert
his
charge
then
illan
took
up
the
defence
of
the
red
branch
hostel
but
the
two
sons
of
conor
slew
him
and
then
at
last
naisi
and
his
brothers
seized
their
weapons
and
rushed
amid
the
foe
and
many
were
they
who
fell
before
the
onset
then
conor
entreated
cathbad
the
druid
to
cast
spells
upon
them
lest
they
should
get
away
and
become
the
enemies
of
the
province
and
he
vowed
to
do
them
no
hurt
if
they
were
taken
alive
so
cathbad
conjured
up
as
it
were
a
lake
of
slime
that
seemed
to
be
about
the
feet
of
the
sons
of
usna
and
they
could
not
tear
their
feet
from
it
and
naisi
caught
up
deirdre
and
put
her
on
his
shoulder
for
they
seemed
to
be
sinking
in
the
slime
then
the
guards
and
servants
of
conor
seized
and
bound
them
and
brought
them
before
the
king
and
the
king
called
upon
man
after
man
to
come
forward
and
slay
the
sons
of
usna
but
none
would
obey
him
till
at
last
owen
son
of
duracht
and
prince
of
ferney
came
and
took
the
sword
of
naisi
and
with
one
sweep
he
shore
off
the
heads
of
all
three
and
so
they
died
then
conor
took
deirdre
perforce
and
for
a
year
she
abode
with
him
in
the
palace
in
emain
macha
but
during
all
that
time
she
never
smiled
at
length
conor
said
what
is
it
that
you
hate
most
of
all
on
earth
deirdre
and
she
said
thou
thyself
and
owen
son
of
duracht
and
owen
was
standing
by
then
thou
shalt
go
to
owen
for
a
year
said
conor
but
when
deirdre
mounted
the
chariot
behind
owen
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
for
she
would
not
look
on
those
who
thus
tormented
her
and
conor
said
taunting
her
deirdre
the
glance
of
thee
between
me
and
owen
is
the
glance
of
a
ewe
between
two
then
deirdre
started
up
and
flinging
herself
head
foremost
from
the
chariot
she
dashed
her
head
against
a
rock
and
fell
dead
and
when
they
buried
her
it
is
said
there
grew
from
her
grave
and
from
naisi
s
two
whose
tops
when
they
were
met
each
other
over
the
roof
of
the
great
church
of
armagh
and
intertwined
together
and
none
could
part
them
rebellion
of
when
fergus
mac
roy
came
home
to
emain
macha
after
the
feast
to
which
baruch
bade
him
and
found
the
sons
of
usna
slain
and
one
of
his
own
sons
dead
and
the
other
a
traitor
he
broke
out
against
conor
in
a
storm
of
wrath
and
cursing
and
vowed
to
be
avenged
on
him
with
fire
and
sword
and
he
went
off
straightway
to
connacht
to
take
service
of
arms
with
ailell
and
maev
who
were
king
and
queen
of
that
country
but
though
ailell
was
king
maev
was
the
ruler
in
truth
and
ordered
all
things
as
she
wished
and
took
what
husbands
she
wished
and
dismissed
them
at
pleasure
for
she
was
as
fierce
and
strong
as
a
goddess
of
war
and
knew
no
law
but
her
own
wild
will
she
was
tall
it
is
said
with
a
long
pale
face
and
masses
of
hair
yellow
as
ripe
corn
when
fergus
came
to
her
in
her
palace
at
rathcroghan
in
roscommon
she
gave
him
her
love
as
she
had
given
it
to
many
before
and
they
plotted
together
how
to
attack
and
devastate
the
province
of
ulster
brown
bull
of
now
it
happened
that
maev
possessed
a
famous
red
bull
with
white
front
and
horns
named
finnbenach
and
one
day
when
she
and
ailell
were
counting
up
their
respective
possessions
and
matching
them
against
each
other
he
taunted
her
because
the
finnbenach
would
not
stay
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
but
had
attached
himself
to
ailell
s
herd
so
maev
in
vexation
went
to
her
steward
mac
roth
and
asked
of
him
if
there
were
anywhere
in
erin
a
bull
as
fine
as
the
finnbenach
truly
said
the
steward
there
the
brown
bull
of
quelgny
that
belongs
to
dara
son
of
fachtna
is
the
mightiest
beast
that
is
in
and
after
that
maev
felt
as
if
she
had
no
flocks
and
herds
that
were
worth
anything
at
all
unless
she
possessed
the
brown
bull
of
quelgny
but
this
was
in
ulster
and
the
ulstermen
knew
the
treasure
they
possessed
and
maev
knew
that
they
would
not
give
up
the
bull
without
fighting
for
it
so
she
and
fergus
and
ailell
agreed
to
make
a
foray
against
ulster
for
the
brown
bull
and
thus
to
enter
into
war
with
the
province
for
fergus
longed
for
vengeance
and
maev
for
fighting
for
glory
and
for
the
bull
and
ailell
to
satisfy
maev
here
let
us
note
that
this
contest
for
the
bull
which
is
the
ostensible
theme
of
the
greatest
of
celtic
legendary
tales
the
tain
bo
cuailgné
has
a
deeper
meaning
than
appears
on
the
surface
an
ancient
piece
of
aryan
mythology
is
embedded
in
it
the
brown
bull
is
the
celtic
counterpart
of
the
hindu
indra
represented
in
hindu
myth
as
a
mighty
bull
whose
roaring
is
the
thunder
and
who
lets
loose
the
rains
like
cows
streaming
forth
to
the
advance
of
the
western
connacht
host
for
the
capture
of
this
bull
is
emblematic
of
the
onset
of
night
the
bull
is
defended
by
the
solar
hero
cuchulain
who
however
is
ultimately
overthrown
and
the
bull
is
captured
for
a
season
the
two
animals
in
the
celtic
legend
probably
typify
the
sky
in
different
aspects
they
are
described
with
a
pomp
and
circumstance
which
shows
that
they
are
no
common
beasts
once
we
are
told
they
were
swineherds
of
the
people
of
dana
they
had
been
successively
transformed
into
two
ravens
two
two
warriors
two
demons
two
worms
or
animalculae
and
finally
into
two
the
brown
bull
is
described
as
having
a
back
broad
enough
for
fifty
children
to
play
on
when
he
is
angry
with
his
keeper
he
stamps
the
man
thirty
feet
into
the
ground
he
is
likened
to
a
sea
wave
to
a
bear
to
a
dragon
a
lion
the
writer
heaping
up
images
of
strength
and
savagery
we
are
therefore
concerned
with
no
ordinary
but
with
a
myth
the
features
of
which
are
discernible
under
the
dressing
given
it
by
the
fervid
imagination
of
the
unknown
celtic
bard
who
composed
the
tain
although
the
exact
meaning
of
every
detail
may
be
difficult
to
ascertain
the
first
attempt
of
maev
to
get
possession
of
the
bull
was
to
send
an
embassy
to
dara
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
him
for
a
year
the
recompense
offered
being
fifty
heifers
besides
the
bull
himself
back
and
if
dara
chose
to
settle
in
connacht
he
should
have
as
much
land
there
as
he
now
possessed
in
ulster
and
a
chariot
worth
thrice
seven
with
the
patronage
and
friendship
of
maev
dara
was
at
first
delighted
with
the
prospect
but
tales
were
borne
to
him
of
the
chatter
of
maev
s
messengers
and
how
they
said
that
if
the
bull
was
not
yielded
willingly
it
would
be
taken
by
force
and
he
sent
back
a
message
of
refusal
and
defiance
twas
known
said
maev
the
bull
will
not
be
yielded
by
fair
means
he
shall
now
be
won
by
and
so
she
sent
messengers
around
on
every
side
to
summon
her
hosts
for
the
raid
hosting
of
queen
and
there
came
all
the
mighty
men
of
the
seven
mainés
sons
of
ailell
and
maev
each
with
his
retinue
and
ket
and
anluan
sons
of
maga
with
thirty
hundreds
of
armed
men
and
ferdia
with
his
company
of
firbolgs
boisterous
giants
who
delighted
in
war
and
in
strong
ale
and
there
came
also
the
allies
of
host
of
the
men
of
leinster
who
so
excelled
the
rest
in
warlike
skill
that
they
were
broken
up
and
distributed
among
the
companies
of
connacht
lest
they
should
prove
a
danger
to
the
host
and
cormac
son
of
conor
with
fergus
mac
roy
and
other
exiles
from
ulster
who
had
revolted
against
conor
for
his
treachery
to
the
sons
of
usna
under
the
but
before
the
host
set
forth
towards
ulster
maev
sent
her
spies
into
the
land
to
tell
her
of
the
preparations
there
being
made
and
the
spies
brought
back
a
wondrous
tale
and
one
that
rejoiced
the
heart
of
maev
for
they
said
that
the
debility
of
the
ultonians
had
descended
on
the
province
conor
the
king
lay
in
pangs
at
emain
macha
and
his
son
cuscrid
in
his
and
owen
prince
of
ferney
was
helpless
as
a
child
celtchar
the
huge
grey
warrior
son
of
uthecar
hornskin
and
even
conall
of
the
victories
lay
moaning
and
writhing
on
their
beds
and
there
was
no
hand
in
ulster
that
could
lift
a
spear
nevertheless
maev
went
to
her
chief
druid
and
demanded
of
him
what
her
own
lot
in
the
war
should
be
and
the
druid
said
only
whoever
comes
hack
in
safety
or
comes
not
thou
thyself
shalt
but
on
her
journey
back
she
saw
suddenly
standing
before
her
a
young
maiden
with
tresses
of
yellow
hair
that
fell
below
her
knees
and
clad
in
a
mantle
of
green
and
with
a
shuttle
of
gold
she
wove
a
fabric
upon
a
loom
who
art
thou
girl
said
maev
and
what
dost
thou
i
am
the
prophetess
fedelma
from
the
fairy
mound
of
croghan
said
the
maid
and
i
weave
the
four
provinces
of
ireland
together
for
the
foray
into
how
seest
thou
our
host
asked
maev
i
see
them
all
red
replied
the
prophetess
yet
the
ulster
heroes
are
all
in
their
is
none
that
can
lift
a
spear
against
us
said
maev
i
see
the
host
all
becrimsoned
said
fedelma
i
see
a
man
of
small
stature
but
the
hero
s
light
is
on
his
stripling
young
and
modest
but
in
battle
a
dragon
he
is
like
unto
cuchulain
of
murthemney
he
doth
wondrous
feats
with
his
weapons
by
him
your
slain
shall
lie
at
this
the
vision
of
the
weaving
maiden
vanished
and
maev
drove
homewards
to
rathcroghan
wondering
at
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
puts
the
host
under
on
the
morrow
the
host
set
forth
fergus
mac
roy
leading
them
and
as
they
neared
the
confines
of
ulster
he
bade
them
keep
sharp
watch
lest
cuchulain
of
murthemney
who
guarded
the
passes
of
ulster
to
the
south
should
fall
upon
them
unawares
now
cuchulain
and
his
father
sualtam
were
on
the
borders
of
the
province
and
cuchulain
from
a
warning
fergus
had
sent
him
suspected
the
approach
of
a
great
host
and
bade
sualtam
go
northwards
to
emania
and
warn
the
men
of
ulster
but
cuchulain
himself
would
not
stay
there
for
he
said
he
had
a
tryst
to
keep
with
a
handmaid
of
the
wife
of
laery
the
farmer
so
he
went
into
the
forest
and
there
standing
on
one
leg
and
using
only
one
hand
and
one
eye
he
cut
an
oak
sapling
and
twisted
it
into
a
circular
withe
on
this
he
cut
in
ogham
characters
how
the
withe
was
made
and
he
put
the
host
of
maev
under
not
to
pass
by
that
place
till
one
of
them
had
under
similar
conditions
made
a
similar
withe
and
i
except
my
friend
fergus
mac
roy
he
added
and
wrote
his
name
at
the
end
then
he
placed
the
withe
round
the
of
ardcullin
and
went
his
way
to
keep
his
tryst
with
the
handmaid
when
the
host
of
maev
came
to
ardcullin
the
withe
upon
the
was
found
and
brought
to
fergus
to
decipher
it
there
was
none
amongst
the
host
who
could
emulate
the
feat
of
cuchulain
and
so
they
went
into
the
wood
and
encamped
for
the
night
a
heavy
snowfall
took
place
and
they
were
all
in
much
distress
but
next
day
the
sun
rose
gloriously
and
over
the
white
plain
they
marched
away
into
ulster
counting
the
prohibition
as
extending
only
for
one
night
ford
of
the
forked
cuchulain
now
followed
hard
on
their
track
and
as
he
went
he
estimated
by
the
tracks
they
had
left
the
number
of
the
host
at
eighteen
men
circling
round
the
host
he
now
met
them
in
front
and
soon
came
upon
two
chariots
containing
scouts
sent
ahead
by
maev
these
he
slew
each
man
with
his
driver
and
having
with
one
sweep
of
his
sword
cut
a
forked
pole
of
four
prongs
from
the
wood
he
drove
the
pole
deep
into
a
at
the
place
called
athgowla
and
impaled
on
each
prong
a
bloody
head
when
the
host
came
up
they
wondered
and
feared
at
the
sight
and
fergus
declared
that
they
were
under
not
to
pass
that
ford
till
one
of
them
had
plucked
out
the
pole
even
as
it
was
driven
in
with
the
fingertips
of
one
hand
so
fergus
drove
into
the
water
to
essay
the
feat
and
seventeen
chariots
were
broken
under
him
as
he
tugged
at
the
pole
but
at
last
he
tore
it
out
and
as
it
was
now
late
the
host
encamped
upon
the
spot
these
devices
of
cuchulain
were
intended
to
delay
the
invaders
until
the
ulster
men
had
recovered
from
their
debility
in
the
epic
as
given
in
the
book
of
leinster
and
other
ancient
sources
a
long
interlude
now
takes
place
in
which
fergus
explains
to
maev
who
it
my
little
pupil
setanta
is
thus
harrying
the
host
and
his
boyish
deeds
some
of
which
have
been
already
told
in
this
narrative
are
recounted
charioteer
of
the
host
proceeded
on
its
way
next
day
and
the
next
encounter
with
cuchulain
shows
the
hero
in
a
kindlier
mood
he
hears
a
noise
of
timber
being
cut
and
going
into
a
wood
he
finds
there
a
charioteer
belonging
to
a
son
of
ailell
and
maev
cutting
down
of
holly
for
says
he
we
have
damaged
our
chariots
sadly
in
chasing
that
famous
deer
it
must
be
remembered
was
at
ordinary
times
a
slight
and
unimposing
figure
though
in
battle
he
dilated
in
size
and
underwent
a
fearful
distortion
symbolic
of
berserker
the
driver
in
his
work
shall
i
he
asks
cut
the
poles
or
trim
them
for
thee
do
thou
the
trimming
says
the
driver
cuchulain
takes
the
poles
by
the
tops
and
draws
them
against
the
set
of
the
branches
through
his
toes
and
then
runs
his
fingers
down
them
the
same
way
and
gives
them
over
as
smooth
and
polished
as
if
they
were
planed
by
a
carpenter
the
driver
stares
at
him
i
doubt
this
work
i
set
thee
to
is
not
thy
proper
work
he
says
who
art
thou
then
at
all
i
am
that
cuchulain
of
whom
thou
spakest
but
surely
i
am
but
a
dead
man
says
the
driver
nay
replies
cuchulain
i
slay
not
drivers
nor
messengers
nor
men
unarmed
but
run
tell
thy
master
orlam
that
cuchulain
is
about
to
visit
the
driver
runs
off
but
cuchulain
outstrips
him
meets
orlam
first
and
strikes
off
his
head
for
a
moment
the
host
of
maev
see
him
as
he
shakes
this
bloody
trophy
before
them
then
he
disappears
from
is
the
first
glimpse
they
have
caught
of
their
persecutor
of
a
number
of
scattered
episodes
now
follow
the
host
of
maev
spreads
out
and
devastates
the
territories
of
bregia
and
of
murthemney
but
they
can
not
advance
further
into
ulster
cuchulain
hovers
about
them
continually
slaying
them
by
twos
and
threes
and
no
man
knows
where
he
will
swoop
next
maev
herself
is
awed
when
by
the
bullets
of
an
unseen
slinger
a
squirrel
and
a
pet
bird
are
killed
as
they
sit
upon
her
shoulders
afterwards
as
cuchulain
s
wrath
grows
fiercer
he
descends
with
supernatural
might
upon
whole
companies
of
the
connacht
host
and
hundreds
fall
at
his
onset
the
characteristic
distortion
or
which
seized
him
in
his
is
then
described
he
became
a
fearsome
and
multiform
creature
such
as
never
was
known
before
every
particle
of
him
quivered
like
a
bulrush
in
a
running
stream
his
calves
and
heels
and
hams
shifted
to
the
front
and
his
feet
and
knees
to
the
back
and
the
muscles
of
his
neck
stood
out
like
the
head
of
a
young
child
one
eye
was
engulfed
deep
in
his
head
the
other
protruded
his
mouth
met
his
ears
foam
poured
from
his
jaws
like
the
fleece
of
a
wether
the
beats
of
his
heart
sounded
like
the
roars
of
a
lion
as
he
rushes
on
his
prey
a
light
blazed
above
his
head
and
his
hair
became
tangled
about
as
it
had
been
the
branches
of
a
red
stuffed
into
the
gap
of
a
fence
taller
thicker
more
rigid
longer
than
the
mast
of
a
great
ship
was
the
perpendicular
jet
of
dusky
blood
which
out
of
his
scalp
s
very
central
point
shot
upwards
and
was
there
scattered
to
the
four
cardinal
points
whereby
was
formed
a
magic
mist
of
gloom
resembling
the
smoky
pall
that
drapes
a
regal
dwelling
what
time
a
king
at
nightfall
of
a
winter
s
day
draws
near
to
such
was
the
imagery
by
which
gaelic
writers
conveyed
the
idea
of
superhuman
frenzy
at
the
sight
of
cuchulain
in
his
paroxysm
it
is
said
that
once
a
hundred
of
maev
s
warriors
fell
dead
from
horror
compact
of
the
maev
now
tried
to
tempt
him
by
great
largesse
to
desert
the
cause
of
ulster
and
had
a
colloquy
with
him
the
two
standing
on
opposite
sides
of
a
glen
across
which
they
talked
she
scanned
him
closely
and
was
struck
by
his
slight
and
boyish
appearance
she
failed
to
move
him
from
his
loyalty
to
ulster
and
death
descends
more
thickly
than
ever
upon
the
connacht
host
the
men
are
afraid
to
move
out
for
plunder
save
in
twenties
and
thirties
and
at
night
the
stones
from
cuchulain
s
sling
whistle
continually
through
the
camp
braining
or
maiming
at
last
through
the
mediation
of
fergus
an
agreement
was
come
to
cuchulain
undertook
not
to
harry
the
host
provided
they
would
only
send
against
him
one
champion
at
a
time
whom
cuchulain
would
meet
in
battle
at
the
ford
of
the
river
dee
which
is
now
called
the
ford
of
ferdia
while
each
fight
was
in
progress
the
host
might
move
on
but
when
it
was
ended
they
must
encamp
till
the
morrow
morning
better
to
lose
one
man
a
day
than
a
hundred
said
maev
and
the
pact
was
made
and
several
single
combats
are
then
narrated
in
which
cuchulain
is
always
a
victor
maev
even
persuades
fergus
to
go
against
him
but
fergus
and
cuchulain
will
on
no
account
fight
each
other
and
cuchulain
by
agreement
with
fergus
pretends
to
fly
before
him
on
fergus
s
promise
that
he
will
do
the
same
for
cuchulain
when
required
how
this
pledge
was
kept
we
shall
see
later
of
the
brown
during
one
of
cuchulain
s
duels
with
a
famous
champion
natchrantal
maev
with
a
third
of
her
army
makes
a
sudden
foray
into
ulster
and
penetrates
as
far
as
dunseverick
on
the
northern
coast
plundering
and
ravaging
as
they
go
the
brown
bull
who
was
originally
at
quelgny
down
has
been
warned
at
an
earlier
stage
by
the
morrigan
to
withdraw
himself
and
he
has
taken
refuge
with
his
herd
of
cows
in
a
glen
of
slievegallion
armagh
the
raiders
of
maev
find
him
there
and
drive
him
off
with
the
herd
in
triumph
passing
cuchulain
as
they
return
cuchulain
slays
the
leader
of
the
son
of
can
not
rescue
the
bull
and
this
it
is
said
was
the
greatest
affront
put
on
cuchulain
during
the
course
of
the
the
raid
ought
now
to
have
ceased
for
its
object
has
been
attained
but
by
this
time
the
hostings
of
the
four
southern
provinces
had
gathered
together
under
maev
for
the
plunder
of
ulster
and
cuchulain
remained
still
the
solitary
warder
of
the
marches
nor
did
maev
keep
her
agreement
for
bands
of
twenty
warriors
at
a
time
were
loosed
against
him
and
he
had
much
ado
to
defend
himself
the
curious
episode
of
the
fight
with
the
morrigan
now
occurs
a
young
woman
clad
in
a
mantle
of
many
colours
appears
to
cuchulain
telling
him
that
she
is
a
king
s
daughter
attracted
by
the
tales
of
his
great
exploits
and
she
has
come
to
offer
him
her
love
cuchulain
tells
her
rudely
that
he
is
worn
and
harassed
with
war
and
has
no
mind
to
concern
himself
with
women
it
shall
go
hard
with
thee
then
said
the
maid
when
thou
hast
to
do
with
men
and
i
shall
be
about
thy
feet
as
an
eel
in
the
bottom
of
the
then
she
and
her
chariot
vanished
from
his
sight
and
he
saw
but
a
crow
sitting
on
a
branch
of
a
tree
and
he
knew
that
he
had
spoken
with
the
morrigan
fight
with
the
next
champion
sent
against
him
by
maev
was
loch
son
of
mofebis
to
meet
this
hero
it
is
said
that
cuchulain
had
to
stain
his
chin
with
blackberry
juice
so
as
to
simulate
a
beard
lest
loch
should
disdain
to
do
combat
with
a
boy
so
they
fought
in
the
ford
and
the
morrigan
came
against
him
in
the
guise
of
a
white
heifer
with
red
ears
but
cuchulain
fractured
her
eye
with
a
cast
of
his
spear
then
she
came
swimming
up
the
river
like
a
black
eel
and
twisted
herself
about
his
legs
and
ere
he
could
rid
himself
of
her
loch
wounded
him
then
she
attacked
him
as
a
grey
wolf
and
again
before
he
could
subdue
her
he
was
wounded
by
loch
at
this
his
took
hold
of
him
and
he
drove
the
gae
bolg
against
loch
splitting
his
heart
in
two
suffer
me
to
rise
said
loch
that
i
may
fall
on
my
face
on
thy
side
of
the
ford
and
not
backward
toward
the
men
of
it
is
a
warrior
s
boon
thou
askest
said
cuchulain
and
it
is
so
loch
died
and
a
great
despondency
it
is
said
now
fell
upon
cuchulain
for
he
was
outwearied
with
continued
fighting
and
sorely
wounded
and
he
had
never
slept
since
the
beginning
of
the
raid
save
leaning
upon
his
spear
and
he
sent
his
charioteer
laeg
to
see
if
he
could
rouse
the
men
of
ulster
to
come
to
his
aid
at
last
the
but
as
he
lay
at
evening
by
the
grave
mound
of
lerga
in
gloom
and
dejection
watching
the
of
the
vast
army
encamped
over
against
him
and
the
glitter
of
their
innumerable
spears
he
saw
coming
through
the
host
a
tall
and
comely
warrior
who
strode
impetuously
forward
and
none
of
the
companies
through
which
he
passed
turned
his
head
to
look
at
him
or
seemed
to
see
him
he
wore
a
tunic
of
silk
embroidered
with
gold
and
a
green
mantle
fastened
with
a
silver
brooch
in
one
hand
was
a
black
shield
bordered
with
silver
and
two
spears
in
the
other
the
stranger
came
to
cuchulain
and
spoke
gently
and
sweetly
to
him
of
his
long
toil
and
waking
and
his
sore
wounds
and
said
in
the
end
sleep
now
cuchulain
by
the
grave
in
lerga
sleep
and
slumber
deeply
for
three
days
and
for
that
time
i
will
take
thy
place
and
defend
the
ford
against
the
host
of
then
cuchulain
sank
into
a
profound
slumber
and
trance
and
the
stranger
laid
healing
balms
of
magical
power
to
his
wounds
so
that
he
awoke
whole
and
refreshed
and
for
the
time
that
cuchulain
slept
the
stranger
held
the
ford
against
the
host
and
cuchulain
knew
that
this
was
lugh
his
father
who
had
come
from
among
the
people
of
dana
to
help
his
son
through
his
hour
of
gloom
and
despair
sacrifice
of
the
boy
but
still
the
men
of
ulster
lay
helpless
now
there
was
at
emain
macha
a
band
of
thrice
fifty
boys
the
sons
of
all
the
chieftains
of
the
provinces
who
were
there
being
bred
up
in
arms
and
in
noble
ways
and
these
suffered
not
from
the
curse
of
macha
for
it
fell
only
on
grown
men
but
when
they
heard
of
the
sore
straits
in
which
cuchulain
their
playmate
not
long
ago
was
lying
they
put
on
their
light
armour
and
took
their
weapons
and
went
forth
for
the
honour
of
ulster
under
conor
s
young
son
follaman
to
aid
him
and
follaman
vowed
that
he
would
never
return
to
emania
without
the
diadem
of
ailell
as
a
trophy
three
times
they
drove
against
the
host
of
maev
and
thrice
their
own
number
fell
before
them
but
in
the
end
they
were
overwhelmed
and
slain
not
one
escaping
alive
carnage
of
this
was
done
as
cuchulain
lay
in
his
trance
and
when
he
awoke
refreshed
and
well
and
heard
what
had
been
done
his
frenzy
came
upon
him
and
he
leaped
into
his
and
drove
furiously
round
and
round
the
host
of
maev
and
the
chariot
ploughed
the
earth
till
the
ruts
were
like
the
ramparts
of
a
fortress
and
the
scythes
upon
its
wheels
caught
and
mangled
the
bodies
of
the
crowded
host
till
they
were
piled
like
a
wall
around
the
camp
and
as
cuchulain
shouted
in
his
wrath
the
demons
and
goblins
and
wild
things
in
erin
yelled
in
answer
so
that
with
the
terror
and
the
uproar
the
host
of
men
heaved
and
surged
hither
and
thither
and
many
perished
from
each
other
s
weapons
and
many
from
horror
and
fear
and
this
was
the
great
carnage
called
the
carnage
of
murthemney
that
cuchulain
did
to
avenge
the
of
emania
six
score
and
ten
princes
were
then
slain
of
the
host
of
maev
besides
horses
and
women
and
and
common
folk
without
number
it
is
said
that
lugh
mac
ethlinn
fought
there
by
his
son
clan
next
the
men
of
erin
resolved
to
send
against
cuchulain
in
single
combat
the
clan
calatin
now
calatin
was
a
wizard
and
he
and
his
sons
formed
as
it
were
but
one
being
the
sons
being
organs
of
their
father
and
what
any
one
of
them
did
they
all
did
alike
they
were
all
poisonous
so
that
any
weapon
which
one
of
them
used
would
kill
in
nine
days
the
man
who
was
but
grazed
by
it
when
this
multiform
creature
met
cuchulain
each
hand
of
it
hurled
a
spear
at
once
but
cuchulain
caught
the
spears
on
his
shield
and
not
one
of
them
drew
blood
then
he
drew
his
sword
to
lop
off
the
spears
that
bristled
from
his
shield
but
as
he
did
so
the
clan
calatin
rushed
upon
him
and
flung
him
down
thrusting
his
face
into
the
gravel
at
this
cuchulain
gave
a
great
cry
of
distress
at
the
unequal
combat
and
one
of
the
ulster
exiles
fiacha
son
of
firaba
who
was
with
the
host
of
maev
and
was
looking
on
at
the
fight
could
not
endure
to
see
the
plight
of
the
champion
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
with
one
stroke
he
lopped
off
the
hands
that
were
grinding
the
face
of
cuchulain
into
the
gravel
of
the
ford
then
cuchulain
arose
and
hacked
the
clan
calatin
into
fragments
so
that
none
survived
to
tell
maev
what
fiacha
had
done
else
had
he
and
his
thirty
hundred
followers
of
clan
rury
been
given
by
maev
to
the
edge
of
the
sword
to
the
cuchulain
had
now
overcome
all
the
mightiest
of
maev
s
men
save
only
the
mightiest
of
them
all
after
fergus
ferdia
son
of
daman
and
because
ferdia
was
the
old
friend
and
fellow
pupil
of
cuchulain
he
had
never
gone
out
against
him
but
now
maev
begged
him
to
go
and
he
would
not
then
she
offered
him
her
daughter
findabair
of
the
fair
eyebrows
to
wife
if
he
would
face
cuchulain
at
the
ford
but
he
would
not
at
last
she
bade
him
go
lest
the
poets
and
satirists
of
erin
should
make
verses
on
him
and
put
him
to
open
shame
and
then
in
wrath
and
sorrow
he
consented
to
go
and
bade
his
charioteer
make
ready
for
s
fray
then
was
gloom
among
all
his
people
when
they
heard
of
that
for
they
knew
that
if
cuchulain
and
their
master
met
one
of
them
would
return
alive
no
more
very
early
in
the
morning
ferdia
drove
to
the
ford
and
lay
down
there
on
the
cushions
and
skins
of
the
chariot
and
slept
till
cuchulain
should
come
not
till
it
was
full
daylight
did
ferdia
s
charioteer
hear
the
thunder
of
cuchulain
s
approaching
and
then
he
woke
his
master
and
the
two
friends
faced
each
other
across
the
ford
and
when
they
had
greeted
each
other
cuchulain
said
it
is
not
thou
o
ferdia
who
shouldst
have
come
to
do
battle
with
me
when
we
were
with
skatha
did
we
not
go
side
by
side
in
every
battle
through
every
wood
and
wilderness
were
we
not
comrades
in
the
feast
and
the
assembly
did
we
not
share
one
bed
and
one
deep
slumber
but
ferdia
replied
o
cuchulain
thou
of
the
wondrous
feats
though
we
have
studied
poetry
and
science
together
and
though
i
have
heard
thee
recite
our
deeds
of
friendship
yet
it
is
my
hand
that
shall
wound
thee
i
bid
thee
remember
not
our
comradeship
o
hound
of
ulster
it
shall
not
avail
thee
it
shall
not
avail
they
then
debated
with
what
weapons
they
should
begin
the
fight
and
ferdia
reminded
cuchulain
of
the
art
of
casting
small
javelins
that
they
had
learned
from
skatha
and
they
agreed
to
begin
with
these
backwards
and
forwards
then
across
the
ford
hummed
the
light
javelins
like
bees
on
a
summer
s
day
but
when
noonday
had
come
not
one
weapon
had
pierced
the
defence
of
either
champion
then
they
took
to
the
heavy
missile
spears
and
now
at
last
blood
began
to
flow
for
each
champion
wounded
the
other
time
and
again
at
last
the
day
came
to
its
close
let
us
cease
now
said
ferdia
and
cuchulain
agreed
each
then
threw
his
arms
to
his
charioteer
and
the
friends
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
three
times
and
went
to
their
rest
their
horses
were
in
the
same
paddock
their
drivers
warmed
themselves
over
the
same
fire
and
the
heroes
sent
each
other
food
and
drink
and
healing
herbs
for
their
wounds
next
day
they
betook
themselves
again
to
the
ford
and
this
time
because
ferdia
had
the
choice
of
weapons
the
day
before
he
bade
cuchulain
take
it
now
cuchulain
chose
then
the
heavy
spears
for
close
fighting
and
with
them
they
fought
from
the
chariots
till
the
sun
went
down
and
drivers
and
horses
were
weary
and
the
body
of
each
hero
was
torn
with
wounds
then
at
last
they
gave
over
and
threw
away
their
weapons
and
they
kissed
each
other
as
before
and
as
before
they
shared
all
things
at
night
and
slept
peacefully
till
the
morning
when
the
third
day
of
the
combat
came
ferdia
wore
an
evil
and
lowering
look
and
cuchulain
reproached
him
for
coming
out
in
battle
against
his
comrade
for
the
bribe
of
a
fair
maiden
even
findabair
whom
maev
had
offered
to
every
champion
and
to
cuchulain
himself
if
the
ford
might
be
won
thereby
but
ferdia
said
noble
hound
had
i
not
faced
thee
when
summoned
my
troth
would
be
broken
and
there
would
be
shame
on
me
in
it
is
now
the
turn
of
ferdia
to
choose
the
weapons
and
they
betake
themselves
to
their
heavy
swords
and
though
they
hew
from
each
other
s
thighs
and
shoulders
great
cantles
of
flesh
neither
can
prevail
over
the
other
and
at
last
night
ends
the
combat
this
time
they
parted
from
each
other
in
heaviness
and
gloom
and
there
was
no
interchange
of
friendly
acts
and
their
drivers
and
horses
slept
apart
the
passions
of
the
warriors
had
now
risen
to
a
grim
sternness
of
on
the
fourth
day
ferdia
knew
the
contest
would
be
decided
and
he
armed
himself
with
especial
care
next
his
skin
was
a
tunic
of
striped
silk
bordered
with
golden
spangles
and
over
that
hung
an
apron
of
brown
leather
upon
his
belly
he
laid
a
flat
stone
large
as
a
millstone
and
over
that
a
strong
deep
apron
of
iron
for
he
dreaded
that
cuchulain
would
use
the
gae
bolg
that
day
and
he
put
on
his
head
his
crested
helmet
studded
with
carbuncle
and
inlaid
with
enamels
and
girt
on
his
sword
and
on
his
left
arm
hung
his
broad
shield
with
its
fifty
bosses
of
bronze
thus
he
stood
by
the
ford
and
as
he
waited
he
tossed
up
his
weapons
and
caught
them
again
and
did
many
wonderful
feats
playing
with
his
mighty
weapons
as
a
juggler
plays
with
apples
and
cuchulain
watching
him
said
to
laeg
his
driver
if
i
give
ground
do
thou
reproach
and
mock
me
and
spur
me
on
to
valour
and
praise
and
hearten
me
if
i
do
well
for
i
shall
have
need
of
all
my
o
ferdia
said
cuchulain
when
they
met
what
shall
be
our
weapons
it
is
thy
choice
said
ferdia
then
let
it
be
all
or
any
said
cuchulain
and
ferdia
was
cast
down
at
hearing
this
but
he
said
so
be
it
and
thereupon
the
fight
began
till
midday
they
fought
with
spears
and
none
could
gain
any
advantage
over
the
other
then
cuchulain
drew
his
sword
and
sought
to
smite
ferdia
over
the
rim
of
his
shield
but
the
giant
firbolg
flung
him
off
thrice
cuchulain
leaped
high
into
the
air
seeking
to
strike
ferdia
over
his
shield
but
each
time
as
he
descended
ferdia
caught
him
upon
the
shield
and
flung
him
off
like
a
little
child
into
the
ford
and
laeg
mocked
him
crying
he
casts
thee
off
as
a
river
flings
its
foam
he
grinds
thee
as
a
millstone
grinds
a
corn
of
wheat
thou
elf
never
call
thyself
a
then
at
last
cuchulain
s
frenzy
came
upon
him
and
he
dilated
till
he
overtopped
ferdia
and
the
blazed
about
his
head
in
close
contact
the
two
were
interlocked
whirling
and
trampling
while
the
demons
and
goblins
and
unearthly
things
of
the
glens
screamed
from
the
edges
of
their
swords
and
the
waters
of
the
ford
recoiled
in
terror
from
them
so
that
for
a
while
they
fought
on
dry
land
in
the
midst
of
the
riverbed
and
now
ferdia
found
cuchulain
a
moment
off
his
guard
and
smote
him
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
and
it
sank
deep
into
his
flesh
and
all
the
river
ran
red
with
his
blood
and
he
pressed
cuchulain
sorely
after
that
hewing
and
thrusting
so
that
cuchulain
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
he
shouted
to
laeg
to
fling
him
the
gae
bolg
when
ferdia
heard
that
he
lowered
his
shield
to
guard
himself
from
below
and
cuchulain
drove
his
spear
over
the
rim
of
the
shield
and
through
his
breastplate
into
his
chest
and
ferdia
raised
his
shield
again
but
in
that
moment
cuchulain
seized
the
gae
bolg
in
his
toes
and
drove
it
upward
against
ferdia
and
it
pierced
through
the
iron
apron
and
burst
in
three
the
millstone
that
guarded
him
and
deep
into
his
body
it
passed
so
that
every
crevice
and
cranny
of
him
was
filled
with
its
barbs
tis
enough
cried
ferdia
i
have
my
death
of
that
it
is
an
ill
deed
that
i
fall
by
thy
hand
o
cuchulain
seized
him
as
he
fell
and
carried
him
northward
across
the
ford
that
he
might
die
on
the
further
side
of
it
and
not
on
the
side
of
the
men
of
erin
then
he
laid
him
down
and
a
faintness
seized
cuchulain
and
he
was
falling
when
laeg
cried
rise
up
cuchulain
for
the
host
of
erin
will
be
upon
us
no
single
combat
will
they
give
after
ferdia
has
but
cuchulain
said
why
should
i
rise
again
o
my
servant
now
he
that
lieth
here
has
fallen
by
my
hand
and
he
fell
in
a
swoon
like
death
and
the
host
of
maev
with
tumult
and
rejoicing
with
tossing
of
spears
and
shouting
of
poured
across
the
border
into
ulster
but
before
they
left
the
ford
they
took
the
body
of
ferdia
and
laid
it
in
a
grave
and
built
a
mound
over
him
and
set
up
a
with
his
name
and
lineage
in
ogham
and
from
ulster
came
certain
of
the
friends
of
cuchulain
and
they
bore
him
away
into
murthemney
where
they
washed
him
and
bathed
his
wounds
in
the
streams
and
his
kin
among
the
danaan
folk
cast
magical
herbs
into
the
rivers
for
his
healing
but
he
lay
there
in
weakness
and
in
stupor
for
many
days
rousing
of
now
sualtam
the
father
of
cuchulain
had
taken
his
son
s
horse
the
grey
of
macha
and
ridden
off
again
to
see
if
by
any
means
he
might
rouse
the
men
of
ulster
to
defend
the
province
and
he
went
crying
abroad
the
men
of
ulster
are
being
slain
the
women
carried
captive
the
kine
driven
yet
they
stared
on
him
stupidly
as
though
they
knew
not
of
what
he
spake
at
last
he
came
to
emania
and
there
were
cathbad
the
druid
and
conor
the
king
and
all
their
nobles
and
lords
and
sualtam
cried
aloud
to
them
the
men
of
ulster
are
being
slain
the
women
carried
captive
the
kine
driven
and
cuchulain
alone
holds
the
gap
of
ulster
against
the
four
provinces
of
erin
arise
and
defend
yourselves
but
cathbad
only
said
death
were
the
due
of
him
who
thus
disturbs
the
king
and
conor
said
yet
it
is
true
what
the
man
says
and
the
lords
of
ulster
wagged
their
heads
and
murmured
true
indeed
it
then
sualtam
wheeled
round
his
horse
in
anger
and
was
about
to
depart
when
with
a
start
which
the
grey
made
his
neck
fell
against
the
sharp
rim
of
the
shield
upon
his
back
and
it
shore
off
his
head
and
the
head
fell
on
the
ground
yet
still
it
cried
its
message
as
it
lay
and
at
last
conor
bade
put
it
on
a
pillar
that
it
might
be
at
rest
but
it
still
went
on
crying
and
exhorting
and
at
length
into
the
clouded
mind
of
the
king
the
truth
began
to
penetrate
and
the
glazed
eyes
of
the
warriors
began
to
glow
and
slowly
the
spell
of
macha
s
curse
was
lifted
from
their
minds
and
bodies
then
conor
arose
and
swore
a
mighty
oath
saying
the
heavens
are
above
us
and
the
earth
beneath
us
and
the
sea
is
round
about
us
and
surely
unless
the
heavens
fall
on
us
and
the
earth
gape
to
swallow
us
up
and
the
sea
overwhelm
the
earth
i
will
restore
every
woman
to
her
hearth
and
every
cow
to
its
his
druid
proclaimed
that
the
hour
was
propitious
and
the
king
bade
his
messengers
go
forth
on
every
side
and
summon
ulster
to
arms
and
he
named
to
them
warriors
long
dead
as
well
as
the
living
for
the
cloud
of
the
curse
still
lingered
in
his
brain
with
the
curse
now
departed
from
them
the
men
of
ulster
flocked
joyfully
to
the
summons
and
on
every
hand
there
was
grinding
of
spears
and
swords
and
buckling
on
of
armour
and
harnessing
of
for
the
of
the
province
one
host
came
under
conor
the
king
and
keltchar
son
of
uthecar
hornskin
from
emania
southwards
and
another
from
the
west
along
the
very
track
of
the
host
of
maev
and
conor
s
host
fell
upon
eight
score
of
the
men
of
erin
in
meath
who
were
carrying
away
a
great
booty
of
and
they
slew
every
man
of
the
eight
score
and
rescued
the
women
maev
and
her
host
then
fell
back
toward
connacht
but
when
they
reached
slemon
midi
the
hill
of
slane
in
meath
the
ulster
bands
joined
each
other
there
and
prepared
to
give
battle
maev
sent
her
messenger
mac
roth
to
view
the
ulster
host
on
the
plain
of
garach
and
report
upon
it
mac
roth
came
back
with
an
description
of
what
he
beheld
when
he
first
looked
he
saw
the
plain
covered
with
deer
and
other
wild
beasts
these
explains
fergus
had
been
driven
out
of
the
forests
by
the
advancing
host
of
the
ulster
men
the
second
time
mac
roth
looked
he
saw
a
mist
that
filled
the
valleys
the
standing
above
it
like
islands
out
of
the
mist
there
came
thunder
and
flashes
of
light
and
a
wind
that
nearly
threw
him
off
his
feet
what
is
this
asks
maev
and
fergus
tells
her
that
the
mist
is
the
deep
breathing
of
the
warriors
as
they
march
and
the
light
is
the
flashing
of
their
eyes
and
the
thunder
is
the
clangour
of
their
and
the
clash
of
their
weapons
as
they
go
to
the
fight
they
think
they
will
never
reach
it
says
fergus
we
have
warriors
to
meet
them
says
maev
you
will
need
that
says
fergus
for
in
all
ireland
nay
in
all
the
western
world
to
greece
and
scythia
and
the
tower
of
bregon
and
the
island
of
gades
there
live
not
who
can
face
the
men
of
ulster
in
their
a
long
passage
then
follows
describing
the
appearance
and
equipment
of
each
of
the
ulster
chiefs
battle
of
the
battle
was
joined
on
the
plain
of
garach
in
meath
fergus
wielding
a
sword
the
sword
which
it
was
said
when
swung
in
battle
made
circles
like
the
arch
of
a
rainbow
swept
down
whole
ranks
of
the
ulster
men
at
each
blow
and
the
fierce
maev
charged
thrice
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
fergus
met
conor
the
king
and
smote
him
on
his
shield
but
cormac
the
king
s
son
begged
for
his
father
s
life
fergus
then
turned
on
conall
of
the
victories
too
hot
art
thou
said
conall
against
thy
people
and
thy
race
for
a
fergus
then
turned
from
slaying
the
ulstermen
but
in
his
he
smote
among
the
hills
with
his
and
struck
off
the
tops
of
the
three
of
meath
so
that
they
are
to
this
day
cuchulain
in
his
stupor
heard
the
crash
of
fergus
s
blows
and
coming
slowly
to
himself
he
asked
of
laeg
what
it
meant
it
is
the
of
fergus
said
laeg
then
he
sprang
up
and
his
body
dilated
so
that
the
wrappings
and
swathings
that
had
been
bound
on
him
flew
off
and
he
armed
himself
and
rushed
into
the
battle
here
he
met
fergus
turn
hither
fergus
he
shouted
i
will
wash
thee
as
foam
in
a
pool
i
will
go
over
thee
as
the
tail
goes
over
a
cat
i
will
smite
thee
as
a
mother
smites
her
who
speaks
thus
to
me
cried
fergus
cuchulain
mac
sualtam
and
now
do
thou
avoid
me
as
thou
art
i
have
promised
even
that
said
fergus
and
then
went
out
of
the
battle
and
with
him
the
men
of
leinster
and
the
men
of
munster
leaving
maev
with
her
seven
sons
and
the
hosting
of
connacht
alone
it
was
midday
when
cuchulain
came
into
the
fight
when
the
evening
sun
was
shining
through
the
leaves
of
the
trees
his
was
but
two
wheels
and
a
handful
of
shattered
ribs
and
the
host
of
connacht
was
in
full
flight
towards
the
border
cuchulain
overtook
maev
who
crouched
under
her
chariot
and
entreated
grace
i
am
not
wont
to
slay
women
said
cuchulain

the

quickly
slew

tossed
his
fragments
about
the
land
so
that
pieces
of

were
strewn
from

to

then
careered
madly

it
was

out
in

of

in

year
by
the
hand
of

mac
gorman

a

on

as

stands
here
and
shall
not
give
it
in
any

in
one
of
the
strangest
tales
in
celtic
legend
tells
how
cuchulain
as
he
lay
asleep
after
hunting
against
a
had
a
vision
of
two
danaan
women
who
came
to
him
armed
with
rods
and
alternately
beat
him
till
he
was
all
but
dead
and
he
could
not
lift
a
hand
to
defend
himself
next
day
and
for
a
year
thereafter
he
lay
in
sore
sickness
and
none
could
heal
him
then
a
man
whom
none
knew
came
and
told
him
to
go
to
the
where
he
had
seen
the
vision
and
he
would
learn
what
was
to
be
done
for
his
recovery
there
he
found
a
danaan
woman
in
a
green
mantle
one
of
those
who
had
chastised
him
and
she
told
him
that
fand
the
pearl
of
beauty
wife
of
mananan
the
had
set
her
love
on
him
and
she
was
at
enmity
with
her
husband
mananan
and
her
realm
was
besieged
by
three
demon
kings
against
whom
cuchulain
s
help
was
sought
and
the
price
of
his
help
would
be
the
love
of
fand
laeg
the
charioteer
was
then
sent
by
cuchulain
to
report
upon
fand
and
her
message
he
entered
fairyland
which
lies
beyond
a
lake
across
which
he
passed
in
a
magic
boat
of
bronze
and
came
home
with
a
report
of
fand
s
surpassing
beauty
and
the
wonders
of
the
kingdom
and
cuchulain
then
betook
himself
thither
here
he
had
a
battle
in
a
dense
mist
with
the
demons
who
are
described
as
resembling
doubt
we
are
to
understand
that
they
are
the
folk
of
the
angry
husband
mananan
then
he
abode
with
fand
enjoying
all
the
delights
of
fairyland
for
a
month
after
which
he
bade
her
farewell
and
appointed
a
on
earth
the
strand
of
the
yew
tree
where
she
was
to
meet
him
emer
and
but
emer
heard
of
the
tryst
and
though
not
commonly
disturbed
at
cuchulain
s
numerous
infidelities
she
came
on
this
occasion
with
fifty
of
her
maidens
armed
with
sharp
knives
to
slay
fand
cuchulain
and
fand
perceive
their
chariots
from
afar
and
the
armed
angry
women
with
golden
clasps
shining
on
their
breasts
and
he
prepares
to
protect
his
mistress
he
addresses
emer
in
a
curious
poem
describing
the
beauty
and
skill
and
magical
powers
of
there
is
nothing
the
spirit
can
wish
for
that
she
has
not
emer
replies
in
good
sooth
the
lady
to
whom
thou
dost
cling
seems
in
no
way
better
than
i
am
but
the
new
is
ever
sweet
and
the
is
sour
thou
hast
all
the
wisdom
of
the
time
cuchulain
once
we
dwelled
in
honour
together
and
still
might
dwell
if
i
could
find
favour
in
thy
by
my
word
thou
dost
said
cuchulain
and
shalt
find
it
so
long
as
i
give
me
up
then
said
fand
but
emer
said
nay
it
is
more
fitting
that
i
be
the
deserted
not
so
said
fand
it
is
i
who
must
and
an
eagerness
for
lamentation
seized
upon
fand
and
her
soul
was
great
within
her
for
it
was
shame
for
her
to
be
deserted
and
straightway
to
return
to
her
home
moreover
the
mighty
love
that
she
bore
to
cuchulain
was
tumultuous
in
but
mananan
the
son
of
the
sea
knew
of
her
sorrow
and
her
shame
and
he
came
to
her
aid
none
seeing
him
but
she
alone
and
she
welcomed
him
in
a
mystic
song
wilt
thou
return
to
me
said
mananan
or
abide
with
cuchulain
in
truth
said
fand
neither
of
ye
is
better
or
nobler
than
the
other
but
i
will
go
with
thee
mananan
for
thou
hast
no
other
mate
worthy
of
thee
but
that
cuchulain
has
in
so
she
went
to
mananan
and
cuchulain
who
did
not
see
the
god
asked
laeg
what
was
happening
fand
he
replied
is
going
away
with
the
son
of
the
sea
since
she
hath
not
been
pleasing
in
thy
then
cuchulain
bounded
into
the
air
and
fled
from
the
place
and
lay
a
long
time
refusing
meat
and
drink
until
at
last
the
druids
gave
him
a
draught
of
forgetfulness
and
mananan
it
is
said
shook
his
cloak
between
cuchulain
and
fand
so
that
they
might
meet
no
more
throughout
eternity
vengeance
of
though
maev
made
peace
with
ulster
after
the
battle
of
garech
she
vowed
the
death
of
cuchulain
for
all
the
shame
and
loss
he
had
brought
upon
her
and
on
her
province
and
she
sought
how
she
might
take
her
vengeance
upon
him
now
the
wife
of
the
wizard
calatin
whom
cuchulain
slew
at
the
ford
brought
forth
after
her
husband
s
death
six
children
at
a
birth
namely
three
sons
and
three
daughters
misshapen
hideous
poisonous
born
for
evil
were
they
and
maev
hearing
of
these
sent
them
to
learn
the
arts
of
magic
not
in
ireland
only
but
in
alba
and
even
as
far
as
babylon
they
went
to
seek
for
hidden
knowledge
and
they
came
back
mighty
in
their
craft
and
she
loosed
them
against
cuchulain
and
besides
the
clan
calatin
cuchulain
had
also
other
foes
namely
ere
the
king
of
ireland
son
to
cairpre
whom
cuchulain
had
slain
in
battle
and
lewy
son
of
curoi
king
of
munster
for
curoi
s
wife
blanid
had
set
her
love
on
cuchulain
and
she
bade
him
come
and
take
her
from
curoi
s
dūn
and
watch
his
time
to
attack
the
dūn
when
he
would
see
the
stream
that
flowed
from
it
turn
white
so
cuchulain
and
his
men
waited
in
a
wood
hard
by
till
blanid
judged
that
the
time
was
fit
and
she
then
poured
into
the
stream
the
milk
of
three
cows
then
cuchulain
attacked
the
dūn
and
took
it
by
surprise
and
slew
curoi
and
bore
away
the
woman
but
fercartna
the
bard
of
curoi
went
with
them
and
showed
no
sign
till
finding
himself
near
blanid
as
she
stood
near
the
of
beara
he
flung
his
arms
round
her
and
leaped
with
her
over
the
cliff
and
so
they
perished
and
curoi
was
avenged
upon
his
wife
all
these
now
did
maev
by
secret
messages
and
by
taunts
and
exhortations
arouse
against
cuchulain
and
they
waited
till
they
heard
that
the
curse
of
macha
was
again
heavy
on
the
men
of
ulster
and
then
they
assembled
a
host
and
marched
to
the
plain
of
murthemney
madness
of
and
first
the
children
of
calatin
caused
a
horror
and
a
despondency
to
fall
upon
the
mind
of
cuchulain
and
out
of
the
hooded
thistles
and
and
fluttering
leaves
of
the
forest
they
made
the
semblance
of
armed
battalions
marching
against
murthemney
and
cuchulain
seemed
to
see
on
every
side
the
smoke
of
burning
dwellings
going
up
and
for
two
days
he
did
battle
with
the
phantoms
till
he
was
sick
and
wearied
out
then
cathbad
and
the
men
of
ulster
persuaded
him
to
retire
to
a
solitary
glen
where
fifty
of
the
princesses
of
ulster
and
among
them
niam
wife
of
his
faithful
friend
conall
of
the
victories
tended
him
and
niam
made
him
vow
that
he
would
not
leave
the
dūn
where
he
was
until
she
gave
him
leave
but
still
the
children
of
calatin
filled
the
land
with
apparitions
of
war
and
smoke
and
flames
went
up
and
wild
cries
and
wailings
with
chattering
goblin
laughter
and
the
braying
of
trumpets
and
horns
were
borne
upon
the
winds
and
bave
calatin
s
daughter
went
into
the
glen
and
taking
the
form
of
a
handmaid
of
niam
she
beckoned
her
away
and
led
her
to
a
distance
among
the
woods
and
put
a
spell
of
straying
on
her
so
that
she
was
lost
and
could
find
her
way
home
no
more
bave
then
went
in
the
form
of
niam
to
cuchulain
and
bade
him
up
and
rescue
ulster
from
the
hosts
that
were
harrying
it
and
the
morrigan
came
in
the
form
of
a
great
crow
where
cuchulain
sat
with
the
women
and
croaked
of
war
and
slaughter
then
cuchulain
sprang
up
and
called
laeg
to
harness
his
chariot
but
when
laeg
sought
for
the
grey
of
macha
to
harness
him
the
horse
fled
from
him
and
resisted
and
only
with
great
difficulty
could
laeg
yoke
him
in
the
chariot
while
large
tears
of
dark
blood
trickled
down
his
face
then
cuchulain
having
armed
himself
drove
forth
and
on
every
side
shapes
and
sounds
of
dread
assailed
him
and
clouded
his
mind
and
then
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
saw
a
great
smoke
lit
with
bursts
of
red
flame
over
the
ramparts
of
emain
macha
and
he
thought
he
saw
the
corpse
of
emer
tossed
out
over
the
ramparts
but
when
he
came
to
his
dūn
at
murthemney
there
was
emer
living
and
she
entreated
him
to
leave
the
phantoms
alone
but
he
would
not
listen
to
her
and
he
bade
her
farewell
then
he
bade
farewell
to
his
mother
dectera
and
she
gave
him
a
goblet
of
wine
to
drink
but
ere
he
could
drink
it
the
wine
turned
to
blood
and
he
flung
it
away
saying
my
life
s
end
is
near
this
time
i
shall
not
return
alive
from
the
and
dectera
and
cathbad
besought
him
to
await
the
coming
of
conall
of
the
victories
who
was
away
on
a
journey
but
he
would
not
washer
at
the
when
he
came
to
the
ford
upon
the
plain
of
emania
he
saw
there
kneeling
by
the
stream
as
it
were
a
young
maiden
weeping
and
wailing
and
she
washed
a
heap
of
bloody
raiment
and
warlike
arms
in
the
stream
and
when
she
raised
a
dripping
vest
or
corselet
from
the
water
cuchulain
saw
that
they
were
his
own
and
as
they
crossed
the
ford
she
vanished
from
their
sight
calatin
then
having
taken
his
leave
of
conor
and
of
the
womenfolk
in
emania
he
turned
again
towards
murthemney
and
the
foe
but
on
his
way
he
saw
by
the
roadside
three
old
crones
each
blind
of
one
eye
hideous
and
wretched
and
they
had
made
a
little
fire
of
sticks
and
over
it
they
were
roasting
a
dead
dog
on
spits
of
rowan
wood
as
cuchulain
passed
they
called
to
him
to
alight
and
stay
with
them
and
share
their
food
that
will
i
not
in
sooth
said
he
had
we
a
great
feast
they
said
thou
wouldst
soon
have
stayed
it
doth
not
become
the
great
to
despise
the
then
cuchulain
because
he
would
not
be
thought
discourteous
to
the
wretched
lighted
down
and
he
took
a
piece
of
the
roast
and
ate
it
and
the
hand
with
which
he
took
it
was
stricken
up
to
the
shoulder
so
that
its
former
strength
was
gone
for
it
was
to
cuchulain
to
approach
a
cooking
hearth
and
take
food
from
it
and
it
was
to
him
to
eat
of
his
namesake
of
near
to
slieve
fuad
south
of
armagh
cuchulain
found
the
host
of
his
enemies
and
drove
furiously
against
them
plying
the
champion
s
upon
them
until
the
plain
was
strewn
with
their
dead
then
a
satirist
urged
on
by
lewy
came
near
him
and
demanded
his
spear
have
it
then
said
cuchulain
and
flung
it
at
him
with
such
force
that
it
went
clean
through
him
and
killed
nine
men
beyond
a
king
will
fall
by
that
spear
said
the
children
of
calatin
to
lewy
and
lewy
seized
it
and
flung
it
at
cuchulain
but
it
smote
laeg
the
king
of
charioteers
so
that
his
bowels
fell
out
on
the
cushions
of
the
chariot
and
he
bade
farewell
to
his
master
and
he
died
then
another
satirist
demanded
the
spear
and
cuchulain
said
i
am
not
bound
to
grant
more
than
one
request
on
one
but
the
satirist
said
then
i
will
revile
ulster
for
thy
default
and
cuchulain
flung
him
the
spear
as
before
and
ere
now
got
it
and
this
time
in
flying
back
it
struck
the
grey
of
macha
with
a
mortal
wound
cuchulain
drew
out
the
spear
from
the
horse
s
side
and
they
bade
each
other
farewell
and
the
grey
galloped
away
with
half
the
yoke
hanging
to
its
neck
and
a
third
time
cuchulain
flung
the
spear
to
a
satirist
and
lewy
took
it
again
and
flung
it
back
and
it
struck
cuchulain
and
his
bowels
fell
out
in
the
chariot
and
the
remaining
horse
black
sainglend
broke
away
and
left
him
i
would
fain
go
as
far
as
to
that
to
drink
said
cuchulain
knowing
the
end
was
come
and
they
suffered
him
to
go
when
he
had
promised
to
return
to
them
again
so
he
gathered
up
his
bowels
into
his
breast
and
went
to
the
and
drank
and
bathed
himself
and
came
forth
again
to
die
now
there
was
close
by
a
tall
that
stood
westwards
of
the
loch
and
he
went
up
to
it
and
slung
his
girdle
over
it
and
round
his
breast
so
that
he
might
die
in
his
standing
and
not
in
his
lying
down
and
his
blood
ran
down
in
a
little
stream
into
the
loch
and
an
otter
came
out
of
the
loch
and
lapped
it
and
the
host
gathered
round
but
feared
to
approach
him
while
the
life
was
still
in
him
and
the
shone
above
his
brow
then
came
the
grey
of
macha
to
protect
him
scattering
his
foes
with
biting
and
kicking
and
then
came
a
crow
and
settled
on
his
shoulder
lewy
when
he
saw
this
drew
near
and
pulled
the
hair
of
cuchulain
to
one
side
over
his
shoulder
and
with
his
sword
he
smote
off
his
head
and
the
sword
fell
from
cuchulain
s
hand
and
smote
off
the
hand
of
lewy
as
it
fell
they
took
the
hand
of
cuchulain
in
revenge
for
this
and
bore
the
head
and
hand
south
to
tara
and
there
buried
them
and
over
them
they
raised
a
mound
but
conall
of
the
victories
hastening
to
cuchulain
s
side
on
the
news
of
the
war
met
the
grey
of
macha
streaming
with
blood
and
together
they
went
to
the
and
saw
him
headless
and
bound
to
the
and
the
horse
came
and
laid
its
head
on
his
breast
conall
drove
southwards
to
avenge
cuchulain
and
he
came
on
lewy
by
the
river
liffey
and
because
lewy
had
but
one
hand
conall
tied
one
of
his
behind
his
back
and
for
half
the
day
they
fought
but
neither
could
prevail
then
came
conall
s
horse
the
and
tore
a
piece
out
of
lewy
s
side
and
conall
slew
him
and
took
his
head
and
returned
to
emain
macha
but
they
made
no
show
of
triumph
in
entering
the
city
for
cuchulain
the
hound
of
ulster
was
no
more
recovery
of
the
the
history
of
the
tain
or
cattle
raid
of
quelgny
was
traditionally
supposed
to
have
been
written
by
no
other
than
fergus
mac
roy
but
for
a
long
time
the
great
lay
or
saga
was
lost
it
was
believed
to
have
been
written
out
in
ogham
characters
on
staves
of
wood
which
a
bard
who
possessed
them
had
taken
with
him
into
italy
whence
they
never
returned
the
recovery
of
the
tain
was
the
subject
of
a
number
of
legends
which
sir
ferguson
in
his
lays
of
the
western
gael
has
combined
in
a
poem
of
so
much
power
so
much
insight
into
the
spirit
of
gaelic
myth
that
i
venture
to
reproduce
much
of
it
here
in
telling
this
singular
and
beautiful
story
it
is
said
that
after
the
loss
of
the
tain
sanchan
torpest
chief
bard
of
ireland
was
once
taunted
at
a
feast
by
the
high
king
guary
on
his
inability
to
recite
the
most
famous
and
splendid
of
gaelic
poems
this
touched
the
bard
to
the
quick
and
he
resolved
to
recover
the
lost
treasure
far
and
wide
through
erin
and
through
alba
he
searched
for
traces
of
the
lay
but
could
only
recover
scattered
fragments
he
would
have
conjured
up
by
magic
arts
the
spirit
of
fergus
to
teach
it
to
him
even
at
the
cost
of
his
own
such
it
seems
would
have
been
the
price
demanded
for
the
intervention
and
help
of
the
the
place
of
fergus
s
grave
where
the
spells
must
be
said
could
not
be
discovered
at
last
sanchan
sent
his
son
murgen
with
his
younger
brother
eimena
to
journey
to
italy
and
endeavour
to
discover
there
the
fate
of
the
the
brothers
set
off
on
their
journey
eastward
breadthwise
over
erin
straightway
travell

the
twain

with

by

breathed
the

of

and
sound
then
interlacing
lo
the
signs
took
form
of
speech
and
with
joy
and
wonder
mainly
thrilling
part
with
fear
murgen
read
the
legend
plainly
fergus
son
of
roy
is
murgen
then
though
he
knew
the
penalty
appealed
to
fergus
to
pity
a
son
s
distress
and
vowed
for
the
sake
of
the
recovery
of
the
tain
to
give
his
life
and
abandon
his
kin
and
friends
and
the
maiden
he
loves
so
that
his

might
no
more

gave
no

with

round
the
fragments
that
phantom
chariot
of
cuchulain
however
makes
an
impressive
reappearance
in
a
much
later
legend
of
christian
origin
found
in
the
book
of
the
dun
he
was
summoned
from
hell
we
are
told
by
patrick
to
prove
the
truths
of
christianity
and
the
horrors
of
damnation
to
the
pagan
monarch
laery
mac
neill
king
of
ireland
laery
with
benen
a
companion
of
patrick
are
standing
on
the
plain
of
mac
indoc
when
a
blast
of
icy
wind
nearly
takes
them
off
their
feet
it
is
the
wind
of
hell
benen
explains
after
its
opening
before
cuchulain
then
a
dense
mist
covers
the
plain
and
anon
a
huge
phantom
chariot
with
galloping
horses
a
grey
and
a
black
loom
up
through
the
mist
within
it
are
the
famous
two
cuchulain
and
his
charioteer
giant
figures
armed
with
all
the
splendour
of
the
gaelic
warrior
cuchulain
then
talks
to
laery
and
urges
him
to
believe
in
god
and
in
holy
patrick
for
it
is
not
a
demon
that
has
come
to
thee
but
cuchulain
son
of
to
prove
his
identity
he
recounts
his
famous
deeds
of
arms
and
ends
by
a
piteous
description
of
his
present
state
what
i
suffered
of
trouble
o
laery
by
sea
and
yet
more
severe
was
a
single
night
when
the
demon
was
wrathful
great
as
was
my
heroism
hard
as
was
my
sword
the
devil
crushed
me
with
one
finger
into
the
red
charcoal
he
ends
by
beseeching
patrick
that
heaven
may
be
granted
to
him
and
the
legend
tells
that
the
prayer
was
granted
and
that
laery
believed
of
conor
mac
christian
ideas
have
also
gathered
round
the
end
of
cuchulain
s
lord
king
conor
of
ulster
the
manner
of
his
death
was
as
follows
an
unjust
and
cruel
attack
had
been
made
by
him
on
mesgedra
king
of
leinster
in
which
that
monarch
met
his
death
at
the
hand
of
conall
of
the
victories
conall
took
out
the
brains
of
the
dead
king
and
mingled
them
with
lime
to
make
a
brain
balls
as
they
were
called
being
accounted
the
most
deadly
of
missiles
this
ball
was
laid
up
in
the
king
s
at
emain
macha
where
the
connacht
champion
ket
son
of
maga
found
it
one
day
when
prowling
in
disguise
through
ulster
ket
took
it
away
and
kept
it
always
by
him
not
long
thereafter
the
connacht
men
took
a
spoil
of
cattle
from
ulster
and
the
ulster
men
under
conor
overtook
them
at
a
still
called
athnurchar
the
ford
of
the
in
westmeath
a
battle
was
imminent
and
many
of
the
ladies
of
connacht
came
to
their
side
of
the
river
to
view
the
famous
ultonian
warriors
and
especially
conor
the
stateliest
man
of
his
time
conor
was
willing
to
show
himself
and
seeing
none
but
women
on
the
other
bank
he
drew
near
them
but
ket
who
was
lurking
in
ambush
now
rose
and
slung
the
at
conor
striking
him
full
in
the
forehead
conor
fell
and
was
carried
off
by
his
routed
followers
when
they
got
him
home
still
living
to
emain
macha
his
physician
fingen
pronounced
that
if
the
ball
were
extracted
from
his
head
he
must
die
it
was
accordingly
sewn
up
with
golden
thread
and
the
king
was
bidden
to
keep
himself
from
and
from
all
vehement
passion
and
exertion
and
he
would
do
well
seven
years
afterwards
conor
saw
the
sun
darken
at
noonday
and
he
summoned
his
druid
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
the
portent
the
druid
in
a
magic
trance
tells
him
of
a
hill
in
a
distant
land
on
which
stand
three
crosses
with
a
human
form
nailed
to
each
of
them
and
one
of
them
is
like
the
immortals
is
he
a
malefactor
then
asks
conor
nay
says
the
druid
but
the
son
of
the
living
god
and
he
relates
to
the
king
the
story
of
the
death
of
christ
conor
breaks
out
in
fury
and
drawing
his
sword
he
hacks
at
the
in
the
sacred
grove
crying
thus
would
i
deal
with
his
enemies
when
with
the
excitement
and
exertion
the
bursts
from
his
head
and
he
falls
dead
and
thus
was
the
vengeance
of
mesgedra
fulfilled
with
conor
and
with
cuchulain
the
glory
of
the
red
branch
and
the
dominance
of
ulster
passed
away
the
next
or
ossianic
cycle
of
irish
legend
brings
upon
the
scene
different
characters
different
physical
surroundings
and
altogether
different
ideals
of
life
and
the
boar
of
mac
the
connacht
champion
ket
whose
main
exploit
was
the
wounding
of
king
conor
at
ardnurchar
figures
also
in
a
very
dramatic
tale
entitled
the
carving
of
mac
datho
s
the
story
runs
as
follows
once
upon
a
time
there
dwelt
in
the
province
of
leinster
a
wealthy
hospitable
lord
named
mesroda
son
of
datho
two
possessions
had
he
namely
a
hound
which
could
outrun
every
other
hound
and
every
wild
beast
in
erin
and
a
boar
which
was
the
finest
and
greatest
in
size
that
man
had
ever
beheld
now
the
fame
of
this
hound
was
noised
all
about
the
land
and
many
were
the
princes
and
lords
who
longed
to
possess
it
and
it
came
to
pass
that
conor
king
of
ulster
and
maev
queen
of
connacht
sent
messengers
to
mac
datho
to
ask
him
to
sell
them
the
hound
for
a
price
and
both
the
messengers
arrived
at
the
dūn
of
mac
datho
on
the
same
day
said
the
connacht
messenger
we
will
give
thee
in
exchange
for
the
hound
six
hundred
milch
cows
and
a
chariot
with
two
horses
the
best
that
are
to
be
found
in
connacht
and
at
the
end
of
a
year
thou
shalt
have
as
much
and
the
messenger
of
king
conor
said
we
will
give
no
less
than
connacht
and
the
friendship
and
alliance
of
ulster
and
that
will
be
better
for
thee
than
the
friendship
of
then
mesroda
mac
datho
fell
silent
and
for
three
days
he
would
not
eat
or
drink
nor
could
he
sleep
o
nights
but
tossed
restlessly
on
his
bed
his
wife
observed
his
condition
and
said
to
him
thy
fast
hath
been
long
mesroda
though
good
food
is
by
thee
in
plenty
and
at
night
thou
turnest
thy
face
to
the
wall
and
well
i
know
thou
dost
not
sleep
what
is
the
cause
of
thy
trouble
there
is
a
saying
replied
mac
datho
trust
not
a
thrall
with
money
nor
a
woman
with
a
when
should
a
man
talk
to
a
woman
said
his
wife
but
when
something
were
amiss
what
thy
mind
can
not
solve
perchance
another
s
then
mac
datho
told
his
wife
of
the
request
for
his
hound
both
from
ulster
and
from
connacht
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
whichever
of
them
i
deny
he
said
they
will
harry
my
cattle
and
slay
my
then
hear
my
counsel
said
the
woman
give
it
to
both
of
them
and
bid
them
come
and
fetch
it
and
if
there
be
any
harrying
to
be
done
let
them
even
harry
each
other
but
in
no
way
mayest
thou
keep
the
mac
datho
followed
this
wise
counsel
and
bade
both
ulster
and
connacht
to
a
great
feast
on
the
same
day
saying
to
each
of
them
that
they
could
have
the
hound
afterwards
so
on
the
appointed
day
conor
of
ulster
and
maev
and
their
retinues
of
princes
and
mighty
men
assembled
at
the
dūn
of
mac
datho
there
they
found
a
great
feast
set
forth
and
to
provide
the
chief
dish
mac
datho
had
killed
his
famous
boar
a
beast
of
enormous
size
the
question
now
arose
as
to
who
should
have
the
honourable
task
of
carving
it
and
bricriu
of
the
poisoned
tongue
characteristically
for
the
sake
of
the
strife
which
he
loved
suggested
that
the
warriors
of
ulster
and
connacht
should
compare
their
principal
deeds
of
arms
and
give
the
carving
of
the
boar
to
him
who
seemed
to
have
done
best
in
the
which
was
always
going
on
between
the
provinces
after
much
bandying
of
words
and
of
taunts
ket
son
of
maga
arises
and
stands
over
the
boar
knife
in
hand
challenging
each
of
the
ulster
lords
to
match
his
deeds
of
valour
one
after
another
they
arise
cuscrid
son
of
conor
keltchar
moonremur
laery
the
triumphant
and
is
not
introduced
in
this
in
each
case
ket
has
some
biting
tale
to
tell
of
an
encounter
in
which
he
has
come
off
better
than
they
and
one
by
one
they
sit
down
shamed
and
silenced
at
last
a
shout
of
welcome
is
heard
at
the
door
of
the
hall
and
the
ulstermen
grow
jubilant
conall
of
the
victories
has
appeared
on
the
scene
he
strides
up
to
the
boar
and
ket
and
he
greet
each
other
with
chivalrous
courtesy
and
now
welcome
to
thee
o
conall
thou
of
the
iron
heart
and
fiery
blood
keen
as
the
glitter
of
ice
chieftain
hail
mighty
son
of
finnchoom
said
ket
and
conall
said
hail
to
thee
ket
flower
of
heroes
lord
of
chariots
a
raging
sea
in
battle
a
strong
majestic
bull
hail
son
of
maga
and
now
went
on
conall
rise
up
from
the
boar
and
give
me
why
so
replied
ket
dost
thou
seek
a
contest
from
me
said
conall
verily
thou
shalt
have
it
by
the
gods
of
my
nation
i
swear
that
since
i
first
took
weapons
in
my
hand
i
have
never
passed
one
day
that
i
did
not
slay
a
connacht
man
nor
one
night
that
i
did
not
make
a
foray
on
them
nor
have
i
ever
slept
but
i
had
the
head
of
a
connacht
man
under
my
i
confess
then
said
ket
that
thou
art
a
better
man
than
i
and
i
yield
thee
the
boar
but
if
anluan
my
brother
were
here
he
would
match
thee
deed
for
deed
and
sorrow
and
shame
it
is
that
he
is
anluan
is
here
shouted
conall
and
with
that
he
drew
from
his
girdle
the
head
of
anluan
and
dashed
it
in
the
face
of
ket
then
all
sprang
to
their
feet
and
a
wild
shouting
and
tumult
arose
and
the
swords
flew
out
of
themselves
and
battle
raged
in
the
hall
of
mac
datho
soon
the
hosts
burst
out
through
the
doors
of
the
dūn
and
smote
and
slew
each
other
in
the
open
field
until
the
connacht
host
were
put
to
flight
the
hound
of
mac
datho
pursued
the
chariot
of
king
ailell
of
connacht
till
the
charioteer
smote
off
its
head
and
so
the
cause
of
contention
was
won
by
neither
party
and
mac
datho
lost
his
hound
but
saved
his
lands
and
life
death
of
the
death
of
ket
is
told
in
keating
s
history
of
returning
from
a
foray
in
ulster
he
was
overtaken
by
conall
at
the
place
called
the
ford
of
ket
and
they
fought
long
and
desperately
at
last
ket
was
slain
but
conall
of
the
victories
was
in
little
better
case
and
lay
bleeding
to
death
when
another
connacht
champion
named
beälcu
found
him
kill
me
said
conall
to
him
that
it
be
not
said
i
fell
at
the
hand
of
connacht
but
beälcu
said
i
will
not
slay
a
man
at
the
point
of
death
but
i
will
bring
thee
home
and
heal
thee
and
when
thy
strength
is
come
again
thou
shalt
fight
with
me
in
single
then
beälcu
put
conall
on
a
litter
and
brought
him
home
and
had
him
tended
till
his
wounds
were
healed
the
three
sons
of
beälcu
however
when
they
saw
what
the
ulster
champion
was
like
in
all
his
might
resolved
to
assassinate
him
before
the
combat
should
take
place
by
a
stratagem
conall
contrived
that
they
slew
their
own
father
instead
and
then
taking
the
heads
of
the
three
sons
he
went
back
victoriously
as
he
was
wont
to
ulster
death
of
the
tale
of
the
death
of
queen
maev
is
also
preserved
by
keating
fergus
mac
roy
having
been
slain
by
ailell
with
a
cast
of
a
spear
as
he
bathed
in
a
lake
with
maev
and
ailell
having
been
slain
by
conall
maev
retired
to
an
island
on
loch
ryve
where
she
was
wont
to
bathe
early
every
morning
in
a
pool
near
to
the
forbay
son
of
conor
mac
nessa
having
discovered
this
habit
of
the
queen
s
found
means
one
day
to
go
unperceived
to
the
pool
and
to
measure
the
distance
from
it
to
the
shore
of
the
mainland
then
he
went
back
to
emania
where
he
measured
out
the
distance
thus
obtained
and
placing
an
apple
on
a
pole
at
one
end
he
shot
at
it
continually
with
a
sling
until
he
grew
so
good
a
marksman
at
that
distance
that
he
never
missed
his
aim
then
one
day
watching
his
opportunity
by
the
shores
of
loch
ryve
he
saw
maev
enter
the
water
and
putting
a
bullet
in
his
sling
he
shot
at
her
with
so
good
an
aim
that
he
smote
her
in
the
centre
of
the
forehead
and
she
fell
dead
the
great
had
reigned
in
connacht
it
was
said
for
years
she
is
a
signal
example
of
the
kind
of
women
whom
the
gaelic
bards
delighted
to
portray
gentleness
and
modesty
were
by
no
means
their
usual
characteristics
but
rather
a
fierce
overflowing
life
like
skatha
and
aifa
are
frequently
met
with
and
one
is
reminded
of
the
gaulish
women
with
their
mighty
arms
so
dangerous
to
provoke
of
whom
classical
writers
tell
us
the
gaelic
bards
who
in
so
many
ways
anticipated
the
ideas
of
chivalric
romance
did
not
do
so
in
setting
women
in
a
place
apart
from
men
women
were
judged
and
treated
like
men
neither
as
drudges
nor
as
goddesses
and
we
know
that
well
into
historic
times
they
went
with
men
into
battle
a
practice
only
ended
in
the
sixth
century
mac
leda
and
the
wee
of
the
stories
of
the
ultonian
cycle
which
do
not
centre
on
the
figure
of
cuchulain
one
of
the
most
interesting
is
that
of
fergus
mac
leda
and
the
king
of
the
wee
folk
in
this
tale
fergus
appears
as
king
of
ulster
but
as
he
was
contemporary
with
conor
mac
nessa
and
in
the
cattle
raid
of
quelgny
is
represented
as
following
him
to
war
we
must
conclude
that
he
was
really
a
like
cuchulain
or
owen
of
ferney
the
tale
opens
in
faylinn
or
the
land
of
the
wee
folk
a
race
of
elves
presenting
an
amusing
parody
of
human
institutions
on
a
reduced
scale
but
endowed
like
dwarfish
people
generally
in
the
literature
of
primitive
races
with
magical
powers
iubdan
the
king
of
faylinn
when
flushed
with
wine
at
a
feast
is
bragging
of
the
greatness
of
his
power
and
the
invincibility
of
his
armed
they
not
the
strong
man
glower
who
with
his
axe
has
been
known
to
hew
down
a
thistle
at
a
stroke
but
the
king
s
bard
eisirt
has
heard
something
of
a
giant
race
oversea
in
a
land
called
ulster
one
man
of
whom
would
annihilate
a
whole
battalion
of
the
wee
folk
and
he
incautiously
allows
himself
to
hint
as
much
to
the
boastful
monarch
he
is
immediately
clapped
into
prison
for
his
audacity
and
only
gets
free
by
promising
to
go
immediately
to
the
land
of
the
mighty
men
and
bring
back
evidence
of
the
truth
of
his
incredible
story
so
off
he
goes
and
one
fine
day
king
fergus
and
his
lords
find
at
the
gate
of
their
dūn
a
tiny
little
fellow
magnificently
clad
in
the
robes
of
a
royal
bard
who
demands
entrance
he
is
borne
in
upon
the
hand
of
æda
the
king
s
dwarf
and
bard
and
after
charming
the
court
by
his
wise
and
witty
sayings
and
receiving
a
noble
largesse
which
he
at
once
distributes
among
the
poets
and
other
court
attendants
of
ulster
he
goes
off
home
taking
with
him
as
a
guest
the
dwarf
æda
before
whom
the
wee
folk
fly
as
a
fomorian
giant
although
as
eisirt
explains
the
average
man
of
ulster
can
carry
him
like
a
child
iubdan
is
now
convinced
but
eisirt
puts
him
under
the
bond
of
chivalry
which
no
irish
chieftain
can
repudiate
without
being
shamed
to
go
himself
as
eisirt
has
done
to
the
palace
of
fergus
and
taste
the
king
s
porridge
iubdan
after
he
has
seen
æda
is
much
dismayed
but
he
prepares
to
go
and
bids
bebo
his
wife
accompany
him
you
did
an
ill
deed
she
says
when
you
condemned
eisirt
to
prison
but
surely
there
is
no
man
under
the
sun
that
can
make
thee
hear
so
off
they
go
and
iubdan
s
fairy
steed
bears
them
over
the
sea
till
they
reach
ulster
and
by
midnight
they
stand
before
the
king
s
palace
let
us
taste
the
porridge
as
we
were
bound
says
bebo
and
make
off
before
they
steal
in
and
find
the
to
the
rim
of
which
iubdan
can
only
reach
by
standing
on
his
horse
s
back
in
straining
downwards
to
get
at
the
porridge
he
overbalances
himself
and
falls
in
there
in
the
thick
porridge
he
sticks
fast
and
there
fergus
s
scullions
find
him
at
the
break
of
day
with
the
faithful
bebo
lamenting
they
bear
him
off
to
fergus
who
is
amazed
at
finding
another
wee
man
with
a
woman
too
in
his
palace
he
treats
them
hospitably
but
refuses
all
appeals
to
let
them
go
the
story
now
recounts
in
a
spirit
of
broad
humour
several
rabelaisian
adventures
in
which
bebo
is
concerned
and
gives
a
charming
poem
supposed
to
have
been
uttered
by
iubdan
in
the
form
of
advice
to
fergus
s
as
to
the
merits
for
burning
of
different
kinds
of
timber
the
following
are
extracts
burn
not
the
sweet
of
drooping
branches
of
the
white
blossoms
to
whose
gracious
head
each
man
puts
forth
his
burn
not
the
noble
willow
the
unfailing
ornament
of
poems
bees
drink
from
its
blossoms
all
delight
in
the
graceful
the
delicate
airy
tree
of
the
druids
the
rowan
with
its
berries
this
burn
but
avoid
the
weak
tree
burn
not
the
slender
the
of
the
black
buds
burn
that
speeds
the
wheel
that
yields
the
rider
his
switch
the
ashen
spear
is
the
of
at
last
the
wee
folk
come
in
a
great
multitude
to
beg
the
release
of
iubdan
on
the
king
s
refusal
they
visit
the
country
with
various
plagues
snipping
off
the
ears
of
corn
letting
the
calves
suck
all
the
cows
dry
defiling
the
wells
and
so
forth
but
fergus
is
obdurate
in
their
quality
as
they
promise
to
make
the
plains
before
the
palace
of
fergus
stand
thick
with
corn
every
year
without
ploughing
or
sowing
but
all
is
vain
at
last
however
fergus
agrees
to
ransom
iubdan
against
the
best
of
his
fairy
treasures
so
iubdan
recounts
cauldron
that
can
never
be
emptied
the
harp
that
plays
of
itself
and
finally
he
mentions
a
pair
of
wearing
which
a
man
can
go
over
or
under
water
as
freely
as
on
dry
land
fergus
accepts
the
shoes
and
iubdan
is
released
blemish
of
but
it
is
hard
for
a
mortal
to
get
the
better
of
touch
of
hidden
malice
lurks
in
magical
gifts
and
so
it
proved
now
fergus
was
never
tired
of
exploring
the
depths
of
the
lakes
and
rivers
of
ireland
but
one
day
in
loch
rury
he
met
with
a
hideous
monster
the
or
which
inhabited
that
lake
and
from
which
he
barely
saved
himself
by
flying
to
the
shore
with
the
terror
of
this
encounter
his
face
was
twisted
awry
but
since
a
blemished
man
could
not
hold
rule
in
ireland
his
queen
and
nobles
took
pains
on
some
pretext
to
banish
all
mirrors
from
the
palace
and
kept
the
knowledge
of
his
condition
from
him
one
day
however
he
smote
a
bondmaid
with
a
switch
for
some
negligence
and
the
maid
indignant
cried
out
it
were
better
for
thee
fergus
to
avenge
thyself
on
the
that
hath
twisted
thy
face
than
to
do
brave
deeds
on
women
fergus
bade
fetch
him
a
mirror
and
looked
in
it
it
is
true
he
said
the
of
loch
rury
has
done
this
of
the
conclusion
may
be
given
in
the
words
of
sir
samuel
ferguson
s
fine
poem
on
this
theme
fergus
donned
the
magic
shoes
took
sword
in
hand
and
went
to
loch
rury
for
a
day
and
night
beneath
the
waves
he
rested
out
of
sight
but
all
the
ultonians
on
the
bank
who
stood
saw
the
loch
boil
and
redden
with
his
blood
when
next
at
sunrise
skies
grew
also
red
he
in
his
hand
the
head
gone
was
the
blemish
on
his
goodly
face
each
trait
symmetric
had
resumed
its
place
and
they
who
saw
him
marked
in
all
his
mien
a
king
s
composure
ample
and
serene
he
smiled
he
cast
his
trophy
to
the
bank
said
i
survivor
ulstermen
and
sank
this
fine
tale
has
been
published
in
full
from
an
egerton
by
standish
hayes
o
grady
in
his
silva
the
humorous
treatment
of
the
fairy
element
in
the
story
would
mark
it
as
belonging
to
a
late
period
of
irish
legend
but
the
tragic
and
noble
conclusion
unmistakably
signs
it
as
belonging
to
the
ulster
bardic
literature
and
it
falls
within
the
same
order
of
ideas
if
it
were
not
composed
within
the
same
period
as
the
tales
of
cuchulain
of
irish
before
leaving
this
great
cycle
of
legendary
literature
let
us
notice
what
has
already
perhaps
attracted
the
attention
of
some
extent
to
which
its
chief
characters
and
episodes
have
been
commemorated
in
the
still
surviving
of
the
country
this
is
true
of
irish
legend
in
is
especially
so
of
the
ultonian
cycle
faithfully
indeed
through
many
a
century
of
darkness
and
forgetting
have
these
names
pointed
to
the
hidden
treasures
of
heroic
romance
which
the
labours
of
our
own
day
are
now
restoring
to
light
the
name
of
the
little
town
of
ardee
as
we
have
seen
commemorates
the
tragic
death
of
ferdia
at
the
hand
of
his
heart
companion
the

perhaps
no

and

are
there
still
closely

lies
ready
to

an
agency
for

for

tales
of

cycle
fianna
of
as
the
tales
of
the
ultonian
cycle
cluster
round
the
heroic
figure
of
the
hound
of
cullan
so
do
those
of
the
ossianic
cycle
round
that
of
finn
mac
cumhal
whose
son
oisīn
or
ossian
as
macpherson
called
him
in
the
pretended
translations
from
the
gaelic
which
first
introduced
him
to
the
world
was
a
poet
as
well
as
a
warrior
and
is
the
traditional
author
of
most
of
them
the
events
of
the
ultonian
cycle
are
supposed
to
have
taken
place
about
the
time
of
the
birth
of
christ
those
of
the
ossianic
cycle
fell
mostly
in
the
reign
of
cormac
mac
art
who
lived
in
the
third
century
during
his
reign
the
fianna
of
erin
who
are
represented
as
a
kind
of
military
order
composed
mainly
of
the
members
of
two
clans
clan
bascna
and
clan
morna
and
who
were
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
high
king
and
to
the
repelling
of
foreign
invaders
reached
the
height
of
their
renown
under
the
captaincy
of
finn
the
annalists
of
ancient
ireland
treated
the
story
of
finn
and
the
fianna
in
its
main
outlines
as
sober
history
this
it
can
hardly
be
ireland
had
no
foreign
invaders
during
the
period
when
the
fianna
are
supposed
to
have
flourished
and
the
tales
do
not
throw
a
ray
of
light
on
the
real
history
of
the
country
they
are
far
more
concerned
with
a
fairyland
populated
by
supernatural
beings
beautiful
or
terrible
than
with
any
tract
of
real
earth
inhabited
by
real
men
and
women
the
modern
critical
reader
of
these
tales
will
soon
feel
that
it
would
be
idle
to
seek
for
any
basis
of
fact
in
this
glittering
mirage
but
the
mirage
was
created
by
poets
and
storytellers
of
such
rare
gifts
for
this
kind
of
literature
that
it
took
at
once
an
extraordinary
hold
on
the
imagination
of
the
irish
and
scottish
gael
ossianic
the
earliest
tales
of
this
cycle
now
extant
are
found
in
manuscripts
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
and
were
composed
probably
a
couple
of
centuries
earlier
but
the
cycle
lasted
in
a
condition
of
vital
growth
for
a
thousand
years
right
down
to
michael
comyn
s
lay
of
oisin
in
the
land
of
youth
which
was
composed
about
and
which
ended
the
long
history
of
gaelic
literature
it
has
been
estimated
that
if
all
the
tales
and
poems
of
the
ossianic
cycle
which
still
remain
could
be
printed
they
would
fill
some
volumes
the
size
of
this
moreover
a
very
great
proportion
of
this
literature
even
if
there
were
no
manuscripts
at
all
could
during
the
last
and
the
preceding
centuries
have
been
recovered
from
the
lips
of
what
has
been
absurdly
called
an
illiterate
peasantry
in
the
highlands
and
in
the
parts
or
ireland
it
can
not
but
interest
us
to
study
the
character
of
the
literature
which
was
capable
of
exercising
such
a
spell
with
the
ultonian
let
us
begin
by
saying
that
the
reader
will
find
himself
in
an
altogether
different
atmosphere
from
that
in
which
the
heroes
of
the
ultonian
cycle
live
and
move
everything
speaks
of
a
later
epoch
when
life
was
gentler
and
softer
when
men
lived
more
in
settlements
and
towns
when
the
danaan
folk
were
more
distinctly
fairies
and
less
deities
when
in
literature
the
elements
of
wonder
and
romance
predominated
and
the
iron
string
of
heroism
and
was
more
rarely
sounded
there
is
in
the
ossianic
literature
a
conscious
delight
in
wild
nature
in
scenery
in
the
song
of
birds
the
music
of
the
chase
through
the
woods
in
mysterious
and
romantic
adventure
which
speaks
unmistakably
of
a
time
when
the
free
life
under
the
greenwood
tree
is
looked
back
on
and
idealised
but
no
longer
habitually
lived
by
those
who
celebrate
it
there
is
also
a
significant
change
of
the
conorian
tales
were
the
product
of
a
literary
movement
having
its
sources
among
the
bleak
hills
or
on
the
stern
coasts
of
ulster
in
the
ossianic
cycle
we
find
ourselves
in
the
midlands
or
south
of
ireland
much
of
the
action
takes
place
amid
the
soft
witchery
of
the
killarney
landscape
and
the
difference
between
the
two
regions
is
reflected
in
the
ethical
temper
of
the
tales
in
the
ultonian
cycle
it
will
have
been
noticed
that
however
extravagantly
the
supernatural
element
may
be
employed
the
final
significance
of
almost
every
tale
the
end
to
which
all
the
supernatural
machinery
is
worked
is
something
real
and
human
something
that
has
to
do
with
the
virtues
or
vices
the
passions
or
the
duties
or
men
and
women
in
the
ossianic
cycle
broadly
speaking
this
is
not
so
the
nobler
vein
of
literature
seems
to
have
been
exhausted
and
we
have
now
beauty
for
the
sake
of
beauty
romance
for
the
sake
of
romance
horror
or
mystery
for
the
sake
of
the
excitement
they
arouse
the
ossianic
tales
are
at
their
best
lovely
apparitions
sent
to
be
a
moment
s
they
lack
that
something
found
in
the
noblest
art
as
in
the
noblest
personalities
which
has
power
to
warn
to
comfort
and
coming
of
king
cormac
mac
art
was
certainly
a
historical
character
which
is
more
perhaps
than
we
can
say
of
conor
mac
nessa
whether
there
is
any
real
personage
behind
the
glorious
figure
of
his
great
captain
finn
it
is
more
difficult
to
say
but
for
our
purpose
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
this
question
he
was
a
creation
of
the
celtic
mind
in
one
land
and
in
one
stage
of
its
development
and
our
part
here
is
to
show
what
kind
of
character
the
irish
mind
liked
to
idealise
and
make
stories
about
finn
like
most
of
the
irish
heroes
had
a
partly
danaan
ancestry
his
mother
murna
of
the
white
neck
was
of
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
who
had
wedded
that
ethlinn
daughter
of
balor
the
fomorian
who
bore
the
lugh
to
kian
cumhal
son
of
trenmōr
was
finn
s
father
he
was
chief
of
the
clan
bascna
who
were
contending
with
the
clan
morna
for
the
leadership
of
the
fianna
and
was
overthrown
and
slain
by
these
at
the
battle
of
knock
among
the
clan
morna
was
a
man
named
lia
the
lord
of
luachar
in
connacht
who
was
treasurer
of
the
fianna
and
who
kept
the
treasure
bag
a
bag
made
of
crane
s
skin
and
having
in
it
magic
weapons
and
jewels
of
great
price
that
had
come
down
from
the
days
of
the
danaans
and
he
became
treasurer
to
the
clan
morna
and
still
kept
the
bag
at
rath
luachar
murna
after
the
defeat
and
death
of
cumhal
took
refuge
in
the
forests
of
slieve
bloom
and
there
she
bore
a
whom
she
named
demna
for
fear
that
the
clan
morna
would
find
him
out
and
slay
him
she
gave
him
to
be
nurtured
in
the
wildwood
by
two
aged
women
and
she
herself
became
wife
to
the
king
of
kerry
but
demna
when
he
grew
up
to
be
a
lad
was
called
finn
or
the
fair
one
on
account
of
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
and
his
golden
hair
and
by
this
name
he
was
always
known
thereafter
his
first
deed
was
to
slay
lia
who
had
the
treasure
bag
of
the
fianna
which
he
took
from
him
he
then
sought
out
his
uncle
crimmal
who
with
a
few
other
old
men
survivors
of
the
chiefs
of
clan
bascna
had
escaped
the
sword
at
castleknock
and
were
living
in
much
penury
and
affliction
in
the
recesses
of
the
forests
of
connacht
these
he
furnished
with
a
retinue
and
guard
from
among
a
body
of
youths
who
followed
his
fortunes
and
gave
them
the
treasure
bag
he
himself
went
to
learn
the
accomplishments
of
poetry
and
science
from
an
ancient
sage
and
druid
named
finegas
who
dwelt
on
the
river
boyne
here
in
a
pool
of
this
river
under
boughs
of
hazel
from
which
dropped
the
nuts
of
knowledge
on
the
stream
lived
fintan
the
salmon
of
knowledge
which
whoso
ate
of
him
would
enjoy
all
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
finegas
had
sought
many
a
time
to
catch
this
salmon
but
failed
until
finn
had
come
to
be
his
pupil
then
one
day
he
caught
it
and
gave
it
to
finn
to
cook
bidding
him
eat
none
of
it
himself
but
to
tell
him
when
it
was
ready
when
the
lad
brought
the
salmon
finegas
saw
that
his
countenance
was
changed
hast
thou
eaten
of
the
salmon
he
asked
nay
said
finn
but
when
i
turned
it
on
the
spit
my
thumb
was
burnt
and
i
put
it
to
my
take
the
salmon
of
knowledge
and
eat
it
then
said
finegas
for
in
thee
the
prophecy
is
come
true
and
now
go
hence
for
i
can
teach
thee
no
after
that
finn
became
as
wise
as
he
was
strong
and
bold
and
it
is
said
that
whenever
he
wished
to
divine
what
would
befall
or
what
was
happening
at
a
distance
he
had
but
to
put
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
and
bite
it
and
the
knowledge
he
wished
for
would
be
his
and
the
at
this
time
goll
son
of
morna
was
the
captain
of
the
fianna
of
erin
but
finn
being
come
to
man
s
estate
wished
to
take
the
place
of
his
father
cumhal
so
he
went
to
tara
and
during
the
great
assembly
when
no
man
might
raise
his
hand
against
any
other
in
the
precincts
of
tara
he
sat
down
among
the
king
s
warriors
and
the
fianna
at
last
the
king
marked
him
as
a
stranger
among
them
and
bade
him
declare
his
name
and
lineage
i
am
finn
son
of
cumhal
said
he
and
i
am
come
to
take
service
with
thee
o
king
as
my
father
the
king
accepted
him
gladly
and
finn
swore
loyal
service
to
him
no
long
time
after
that
came
the
period
of
the
year
when
tara
was
troubled
by
a
goblin
or
demon
that
came
at
nightfall
and
blew
against
the
royal
city
setting
it
in
flames
and
none
could
do
battle
with
him
for
as
he
came
he
played
on
a
harp
a
music
so
sweet
that
each
man
who
heard
it
was
lapped
in
dreams
and
forgot
all
else
on
earth
for
the
sake
of
listening
to
that
music
when
this
was
told
to
finn
he
went
to
the
king
and
said
shall
i
if
i
slay
the
goblin
have
my
father
s
place
as
captain
of
the
fianna
yea
surely
said
the
king
and
he
bound
himself
to
this
by
an
oath
now
there
were
among
the
an
old
follower
of
finn
s
father
cumhal
who
possessed
a
magic
spear
with
a
head
of
bronze
and
rivets
of
arabian
gold
the
head
was
kept
laced
up
in
a
leathern
case
and
it
had
the
property
that
when
the
naked
blade
was
laid
against
the
forehead
of
a
man
it
would
fill
him
with
a
strength
and
a
that
would
make
him
invincible
in
every
combat
this
spear
the
man
fiacha
gave
to
finn
and
taught
him
how
to
use
it
and
with
it
he
awaited
the
coming
of
the
goblin
on
the
ramparts
of
tara
as
night
fell
and
mists
began
to
gather
in
the
wide
plain
around
the
hill
he
saw
a
shadowy
form
coming
swiftly
towards
him
and
heard
the
notes
of
the
magic
harp
but
laying
the
spear
to
his
brow
he
shook
off
the
spell
and
the
phantom
fled
before
him
to
the
fairy
mound
of
slieve
fuad
and
there
finn
overtook
and
slew
him
and
bore
back
his
head
to
tara
then
cormac
the
king
set
finn
before
the
fianna
and
bade
them
all
either
swear
obedience
to
him
as
their
captain
or
seek
service
elsewhere
and
first
of
all
goll
mac
morna
swore
service
and
then
all
the
rest
followed
and
finn
became
captain
of
the
fianna
of
erin
and
ruled
them
till
he
died
s
chief
men
conan
mac
with
the
coming
of
finn
the
fianna
of
erin
came
to
their
glory
and
with
his
life
their
glory
passed
away
for
he
ruled
them
as
no
other
captain
ever
did
both
strongly
and
wisely
and
never
bore
a
grudge
against
any
but
freely
forgave
a
man
all
offences
save
disloyalty
to
his
lord
thus
it
is
told
that
conan
son
of
the
lord
of
luachar
him
who
had
the
treasure
bag
and
whom
finn
slew
at
rath
luachar
was
for
seven
years
an
outlaw
and
marauder
harrying
the
fians
and
killing
here
a
man
and
there
a
hound
and
firing
dwellings
and
raiding
their
cattle
at
last
they
ran
him
to
a
corner
at
carn
lewy
in
munster
and
when
he
saw
that
he
could
escape
no
more
he
stole
upon
finn
as
he
sat
down
after
a
chase
and
flung
his
arms
round
him
from
behind
holding
him
fast
and
motionless
finn
knew
who
held
him
thus
and
said
what
wilt
thou
conan
conan
said
to
make
a
covenant
of
service
and
fealty
with
thee
for
i
may
no
longer
evade
thy
so
finn
laughed
and
said
be
it
so
conan
and
if
thou
prove
faithful
and
valiant
i
also
will
keep
conan
served
him
for
thirty
years
and
no
man
of
all
the
fianna
was
keener
and
hardier
in
fight
mac
there
was
also
another
conan
namely
mac
morna
who
was
big
and
bald
and
unwieldy
in
manly
exercises
but
whose
tongue
was
bitter
and
scurrilous
no
high
or
brave
thing
was
done
that
conan
the
bald
did
not
mock
and
belittle
it
is
said
that
when
he
was
stripped
he
showed
down
his
back
and
buttocks
a
black
sheep
s
fleece
instead
of
a
man
s
skin
and
this
is
the
way
it
came
about
one
day
when
conan
and
certain
others
of
the
fianna
were
hunting
in
the
forest
they
came
to
a
stately
dūn
with
coloured
thatching
on
the
roof
and
they
entered
it
to
seek
hospitality
but
when
they
were
within
they
found
no
man
but
a
great
empty
hall
with
pillars
of
and
silken
hangings
about
it
like
the
hall
of
a
wealthy
lord
in
the
midst
there
was
a
table
set
forth
with
a
sumptuous
feast
of
boar
s
flesh
and
venison
and
a
great
vat
of
full
of
red
wine
and
cups
of
gold
and
silver
so
they
set
themselves
gaily
to
eat
and
drink
for
they
were
hungry
from
the
chase
and
talk
and
laughter
were
loud
around
the
board
but
one
of
them
ere
long
started
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
fear
and
wonder
and
they
all
looked
round
and
saw
before
their
eyes
the
tapestried
walls
changing
to
rough
wooden
beams
and
the
ceiling
to
foul
sooty
thatch
like
that
of
a
herdsman
s
hut
so
they
knew
they
were
being
entrapped
by
some
enchantment
of
the
fairy
folk
and
all
sprang
to
their
feet
and
made
for
the
doorway
that
was
no
longer
high
and
stately
but
was
shrinking
to
the
size
of
a
fox
but
conan
the
bald
who
was
gluttonously
devouring
the
good
things
on
the
table
and
heeded
nothing
else
then
they
shouted
to
him
and
as
the
last
of
them
went
out
he
strove
to
rise
and
follow
but
found
himself
limed
to
the
chair
so
that
he
could
not
stir
so
two
of
the
fianna
seeing
his
plight
rushed
back
and
seized
his
arms
and
tugged
with
all
their
might
and
as
they
dragged
him
away
they
left
the
most
part
of
his
raiment
and
his
skin
sticking
to
the
chair
then
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
him
in
his
sore
plight
they
clapped
upon
his
back
the
nearest
thing
they
could
find
which
was
the
skin
of
a
black
sheep
that
they
took
from
a
peasant
s
flock
hard
by
and
it
grew
there
and
conan
wore
it
till
his
death
though
conan
was
a
coward
and
rarely
adventured
himself
in
battle
with
the
fianna
it
is
told
that
once
a
good
man
fell
by
his
hand
this
was
on
the
day
of
the
great
battle
with
the
pirate
horde
on
the
hill
of
slaughter
in
kerry
for
liagan
one
of
the
invaders
stood
out
before
the
hosts
and
challenged
the
bravest
of
the
fians
to
single
combat
and
the
fians
in
mockery
thrust
conan
forth
to
the
fight
when
he
appeared
liagan
laughed
for
he
had
more
strength
than
wit
and
he
said
silly
is
thy
visit
thou
bald
old
and
as
conan
still
approached
liagan
lifted
his
hand
fiercely
and
conan
said
truly
thou
art
in
more
peril
from
the
man
behind
than
from
the
man
in
liagan
looked
round
and
in
that
instant
conan
swept
off
his
head
and
then
threw
his
sword
and
ran
for
shelter
to
the
ranks
of
the
laughing
fians
but
finn
was
very
wroth
because
he
had
won
the
victory
by
a
trick
o
and
one
of
the
chiefest
of
the
friends
of
finn
was
dermot
of
the
love
spot
he
was
so
fair
and
noble
to
look
on
that
no
woman
could
refuse
him
love
and
it
was
said
that
he
never
knew
weariness
but
his
step
was
as
light
at
the
end
of
the
longest
day
of
battle
or
the
chase
as
it
was
at
the
beginning
between
him
and
finn
there
was
great
love
until
the
day
when
finn
then
an
old
man
was
to
wed
grania
daughter
of
cormac
the
high
king
but
grania
bound
dermot
by
the
sacred
ordinances
of
the
fian
chivalry
to
fly
with
her
on
her
wedding
night
which
thing
sorely
against
his
will
he
did
and
thereby
got
his
death
but
grania
went
back
to
finn
and
when
the
fianna
saw
her
they
laughed
through
all
the
camp
in
bitter
mockery
for
they
would
not
have
given
one
of
the
dead
man
s
fingers
for
twenty
such
as
grania
mac
ronan
and
another
of
the
chief
men
that
finn
had
was
keelta
mac
ronan
who
was
one
of
his
and
a
strong
warrior
as
well
as
a
reciter
of
tales
and
poems
and
there
was
oisīn
the
son
of
finn
the
greatest
poet
of
the
gael
of
whom
more
shall
be
told
hereafter
oisīn
had
a
son
oscar
who
was
the
fiercest
fighter
in
battle
among
all
the
fians
he
slew
in
his
maiden
battle
three
kings
and
in
his
fury
he
also
slew
by
mischance
his
own
friend
and
condisciple
linné
his
wife
was
the
fair
aideen
who
died
of
grief
after
oscar
s
death
in
the
battle
of
gowra
and
oisīn
buried
her
on
ben
edar
howth
and
raised
over
her
the
great
dolmen
which
is
there
to
this
day
oscar
appears
in
this
literature
as
a
type
of
hard
strength
with
a
heart
like
twisted
horn
sheathed
in
steel
a
character
made
as
purely
for
war
as
a
sword
or
spear
mac
another
good
man
that
finn
had
was
geena
the
son
of
luga
his
mother
was
the
of
finn
and
his
father
was
a
near
kinsman
of
hers
he
was
nurtured
by
a
woman
that
bore
the
name
of
fair
mane
who
had
brought
up
many
of
the
fianna
to
manhood
when
his
time
to
take
arms
was
come
he
stood
before
finn
and
made
his
covenant
of
fealty
and
finn
gave
him
the
captaincy
of
a
band
but
mac
luga
proved
slothful
and
selfish
for
ever
vaunting
himself
and
his
and
never
training
his
men
to
the
chase
of
deer
or
boar
and
he
used
to
beat
his
hounds
and
his
at
last
the
fians
under
him
came
with
their
whole
company
to
finn
at
loch
lena
in
killarney
and
there
they
laid
their
complaint
against
mac
luga
and
said
choose
now
o
finn
whether
you
will
have
us
or
the
son
of
luga
by
then
finn
sent
to
mac
luga
and
questioned
him
but
mac
luga
could
say
nothing
to
the
point
as
to
why
the
fianna
would
none
of
him
then
finn
taught
him
the
things
befitting
a
youth
of
noble
birth
and
a
captain
of
men
and
they
were
these
of
the
son
of
luga
if

o
son
of
and
the
son
of
luga
it
is
written
heeded
these
counsels
and
gave
up
his
bad
ways
and
he
became
one
of
the
best
of
finn
s
men
of
suchlike
things
also
finn
taught
to
all
his
followers
and
the
best
of
them
became
like
himself
in
valour
and
gentleness
and
generosity
each
of
them
loved
the
repute
of
his
comrades
more
than
his
own
and
each
would
say
that
for
all
noble
qualities
there
was
no
man
in
the
breadth
of
the
world
worthy
to
be
thought
of
beside
finn
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
gave
away
gold
as
if
it
were
the
leaves
of
the
woodland
and
silver
as
if
it
were
the
foam
of
the
sea
and
that
whatever
he
had
bestowed
upon
any
man
if
he
fell
out
with
him
afterwards
he
was
never
known
to
bring
it
against
him
the
poet
oisīn
once
sang
of
him
to
patrick
these
are
the
things
that
were
dear
to
the
din
of
battle
the
banquet
s
glee
the
bay
of
his
hounds
through
the
rough
glen
ringing
and
the
blackbird
singing
in
letter
lee
the
shingle
grinding
along
the
shore
when
they
dragged
his
down
to
sea
the
dawn
wind
whistling
his
spears
among
and
the
magic
song
of
his
minstrels
of
the
in
the
time
of
finn
no
one
was
ever
permitted
to
be
one
of
the
fianna
of
erin
unless
he
could
pass
through
many
severe
tests
of
his
worthiness
he
must
be
versed
in
the
twelve
books
of
poetry
and
must
himself
be
skilled
to
make
verse
in
the
rime
and
metre
of
the
masters
of
gaelic
poesy
then
he
was
buried
to
his
middle
in
the
earth
and
must
with
a
shield
and
a
hazel
stick
there
defend
himself
against
nine
warriors
casting
spears
at
him
and
if
he
were
wounded
he
was
not
accepted
then
his
hair
was
woven
into
braids
and
he
was
chased
through
the
forest
by
the
fians
if
he
were
overtaken
or
if
a
braid
of
his
hair
were
disturbed
or
if
a
dry
stick
cracked
under
his
foot
he
was
not
accepted
he
must
be
able
to
leap
over
a
lath
level
with
his
brow
and
to
run
at
full
speed
under
one
level
with
his
knee
and
he
must
be
able
while
running
to
draw
out
a
thorn
from
his
foot
and
never
slacken
speed
he
must
take
no
dowry
with
a
wife
and
it
was
said
that
one
of
the
fians
namely
keelta
lived
on
to
a
great
age
and
saw
patrick
by
whom
he
was
baptized
into
the
faith
of
the
christ
and
to
whom
he
told
many
tales
of
finn
and
his
men
which
patrick
s
scribe
wrote
down
and
once
patrick
asked
him
how
it
was
that
the
fianna
became
so
mighty
and
so
glorious
that
all
ireland
sang
of
their
deeds
as
ireland
has
done
ever
since
keelta
answered
truth
was
in
our
hearts
and
strength
in
our
arms
and
what
we
said
that
we
this
was
also
told
of
keelta
after
he
had
seen
patrick
and
received
the
faith
he
chanced
to
be
one
day
by
leyney
in
connacht
where
the
fairy
folk
of
the
mound
of
duma
were
wont
to
be
sorely
harassed
and
spoiled
every
year
by
pirates
from
oversea
they
called
keelta
to
their
aid
and
by
his
counsel
and
valour
the
invaders
were
overcome
and
driven
home
but
keelta
was
sorely
wounded
then
keelta
asked
that
owen
the
seer
of
the
fairy
folk
might
foretell
him
how
long
he
had
to
live
for
he
was
already
a
very
aged
man
owen
said
it
will
be
seventeen
years
o
keelta
of
fair
fame
till
thou
fall
by
the
pool
of
tara
and
grievous
that
will
be
to
all
the
king
s
even
so
did
my
chief
and
lord
my
guardian
and
loving
protector
finn
foretell
to
me
said
keelta
and
now
what
fee
will
ye
give
me
for
my
rescue
of
you
from
the
worst
affliction
that
ever
befell
you
a
great
reward
said
the
fairy
folk
even
youth
for
by
our
art
we
shall
change
you
into
a
young
man
again
with
all
the
strength
and
activity
of
your
nay
god
forbid
said
keelta
that
i
should
take
upon
me
a
shape
of
sorcery
or
any
other
than
that
which
my
maker
the
true
and
glorious
god
hath
bestowed
upon
and
the
fairy
folk
said
it
is
the
word
of
a
true
warrior
and
hero
and
the
thing
that
thou
sayest
is
so
they
healed
his
wounds
and
every
bodily
evil
that
he
had
and
he
wished
them
blessing
and
victory
and
went
his
way
birth
of
one
day
as
finn
and
his
companions
and
dogs
were
returning
from
the
chase
to
their
dūn
on
the
hill
of
allen
a
beautiful
fawn
started
up
on
their
path
and
the
chase
swept
after
her
she
taking
the
way
which
led
to
their
home
soon
all
the
pursuers
were
left
far
behind
save
only
finn
himself
and
his
two
hounds
bran
and
skolawn
now
these
hounds
were
of
strange
breed
for
tyren
sister
to
murna
the
mother
of
finn
had
been
changed
into
a
hound
by
the
enchantment
of
a
woman
of
the
fairy
folk
who
loved
tyren
s
husband
ullan
and
the
two
hounds
of
finn
were
the
children
of
tyren
born
to
her
in
that
shape
of
all
hounds
in
ireland
they
were
the
best
and
finn
loved
them
much
so
that
it
was
said
he
wept
but
twice
in
his
life
and
once
was
for
the
death
of
bran
at
last
as
the
chase
went
on
down
a
finn
saw
the
fawn
stop
and
lie
down
while
the
two
hounds
began
to
play
round
her
and
to
lick
her
face
and
limbs
so
he
gave
commandment
that
none
should
hurt
her
and
she
followed
them
to
the
dūn
of
allen
playing
with
the
hounds
as
she
went
the
same
night
finn
awoke
and
saw
standing
by
his
bed
the
fairest
woman
his
eyes
had
ever
beheld
i
am
saba
o
finn
she
said
and
i
was
the
fawn
ye
chased
because
i
would
not
give
my
love
to
the
druid
of
the
fairy
folk
who
is
named
the
dark
he
put
that
shape
upon
me
by
his
sorceries
and
i
have
borne
it
these
three
years
but
a
slave
of
his
pitying
me
once
revealed
to
me
that
if
i
could
win
to
thy
great
dūn
of
allen
o
finn
i
should
be
safe
from
all
enchantments
and
my
natural
shape
would
come
to
me
again
but
i
feared
to
be
torn
in
pieces
by
thy
dogs
or
wounded
by
thy
hunters
till
at
last
i
let
myself
be
overtaken
by
thee
alone
and
by
bran
and
skolawn
who
have
the
nature
of
man
and
would
do
me
no
have
no
fear
maiden
said
finn
we
the
fianna
are
free
and
our
are
free
there
is
none
who
shall
put
compulsion
on
you
so
saba
dwelt
with
finn
and
he
made
her
his
wife
and
so
deep
was
his
love
for
her
that
neither
the
battle
nor
the
chase
had
any
delight
for
him
and
for
months
he
never
left
her
side
she
also
loved
him
as
deeply
and
their
joy
in
each
other
was
like
that
of
the
immortals
in
the
land
of
youth
but
at
last
word
came
to
finn
that
the
warships
of
the
northmen
were
in
the
bay
of
dublin
and
he
summoned
his
heroes
to
the
fight
for
said
he
to
saba
the
men
of
erin
give
us
tribute
and
hospitality
to
defend
them
from
the
foreigner
and
it
were
shame
to
take
it
from
them
and
not
to
give
that
to
which
we
on
our
side
are
and
he
called
to
mind
that
great
saying
of
goll
mac
morna
when
they
were
once
sore
bestead
by
a
mighty
host
a
man
said
goll
lives
after
his
life
but
not
after
his
seven
days
was
finn
absent
and
he
drove
the
northmen
from
the
shores
of
erin
but
on
the
eighth
day
he
returned
and
when
he
entered
his
dūn
he
saw
trouble
in
the
eyes
of
his
men
and
of
their
fair
womenfolk
and
saba
was
not
on
the
rampart
expecting
his
return
so
he
bade
them
tell
him
what
had
chanced
and
they
said
whilst
thou
our
father
and
lord
wert
afar
off
smiting
the
foreigner
and
saba
looking
ever
down
the
pass
for
thy
return
we
saw
one
day
as
it
were
the
likeness
of
thee
approaching
and
bran
and
skolawn
at
thy
heels
and
we
seemed
also
to
hear
the
notes
of
the
fian
blown
on
the
wind
then
saba
hastened
to
the
great
gate
and
we
could
not
stay
her
so
eager
was
she
to
rush
to
the
phantom
but
when
she
came
near
she
halted
and
gave
a
loud
and
bitter
cry
and
the
shape
of
thee
smote
her
with
a
hazel
wand
and
lo
there
was
no
woman
there
any
more
but
a
deer
then
those
hounds
chased
it
and
ever
as
it
strove
to
reach
again
the
gate
of
the
dūn
they
turned
back
we
all
now
seized
what
arms
we
could
and
ran
out
to
drive
away
the
enchanter
but
when
we
reached
the
place
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
only
still
we
heard
the
rushing
of
flying
feet
and
the
baying
of
dogs
and
one
thought
it
came
from
here
and
another
from
there
till
at
last
the
uproar
died
away
and
all
was
still
what
we
could
do
o
finn
we
did
saba
is
finn
then
struck
his
hand
on
his
breast
but
spoke
no
word
and
he
went
to
his
own
chamber
no
man
saw
him
for
the
rest
of
that
day
nor
for
the
day
after
then
he
came
forth
and
ordered
the
matters
of
the
fianna
as
of
old
but
for
seven
years
thereafter
he
went
searching
for
saba
through
every
remote
glen
and
dark
forest
and
cavern
of
ireland
and
he
would
take
no
hounds
with
him
save
bran
and
skolawn
but
at
last
he
renounced
all
hope
of
finding
her
again
and
went
hunting
as
of
old
one
day
as
he
was
following
the
chase
on
ben
bulban
in
sligo
he
heard
the
musical
bay
of
the
dogs
change
of
a
sudden
to
a
fierce
growling
and
yelping
as
though
they
were
in
combat
with
some
beast
and
running
hastily
up
he
and
his
men
beheld
under
a
great
tree
a
naked
boy
with
long
hair
and
around
him
the
hounds
struggling
to
seize
him
but
bran
and
skolawn
fighting
with
them
and
keeping
them
off
and
the
lad
was
tall
and
shapely
and
as
the
heroes
gathered
round
he
gazed
undauntedly
on
them
never
heeding
the
rout
of
dogs
at
his
feet
the
fians
beat
off
the
dogs
and
brought
the
lad
home
with
them
and
finn
was
very
silent
and
continually
searched
the
lad
s
countenance
with
his
eyes
in
time
the
use
of
speech
came
to
him
and
the
story
that
he
told
was
this
he
had
known
no
father
and
no
mother
save
a
gentle
hind
with
whom
he
lived
in
a
most
green
and
pleasant
valley
shut
in
on
every
side
by
towering
cliffs
that
could
not
be
scaled
or
by
deep
chasms
in
the
earth
in
the
summer
he
lived
on
fruits
and
suchlike
and
in
the
winter
store
of
provisions
was
laid
for
him
in
a
cave
and
there
came
to
them
sometimes
a
tall
man
who
spoke
to
his
mother
now
tenderly
and
now
in
loud
menace
but
she
always
shrank
away
in
fear
and
the
man
departed
in
anger
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
the
dark
man
spoke
very
long
with
his
mother
in
all
tones
of
entreaty
and
of
tenderness
and
of
rage
but
she
would
still
keep
aloof
and
give
no
sign
save
of
fear
and
abhorrence
then
at
length
the
dark
man
drew
near
and
smote
her
with
a
hazel
wand
and
with
that
he
turned
and
went
his
way
but
she
this
time
followed
him
still
looking
back
at
her
son
and
piteously
complaining
and
he
when
he
strove
to
follow
found
himself
unable
to
move
a
limb
and
crying
out
with
rage
and
desolation
he
fell
to
the
earth
and
his
senses
left
him
when
he
came
to
himself
he
was
on
the
on
ben
bulban
where
he
remained
some
days
searching
for
that
green
and
hidden
valley
which
he
never
found
again
and
after
a
while
the
dogs
found
him
but
of
the
hind
his
mother
and
of
the
dark
druid
there
is
no
man
knows
the
end
finn
called
his
name
oisīn
little
fawn
and
he
became
a
warrior
of
fame
but
far
more
famous
for
the
songs
and
tales
that
he
made
so
that
of
all
things
to
this
day
that
are
told
of
the
fianna
of
erin
men
are
wont
to
say
thus
sang
the
bard
oisīn
son
of
and
it
happened
that
on
a
misty
summer
morning
as
finn
and
oisīn
with
many
companions
were
hunting
on
the
shores
of
loch
lena
they
saw
coming
towards
them
a
maiden
beautiful
exceedingly
riding
on
a
steed
she
wore
the
garb
of
a
queen
a
crown
of
gold
was
on
her
head
and
a
mantle
of
silk
set
with
stars
of
red
gold
fell
around
her
and
trailed
on
the
ground
silver
shoes
were
on
her
horse
s
hoofs
and
a
crest
of
gold
nodded
on
his
head
when
she
came
near
she
said
to
finn
from
very
far
away
i
have
come
and
now
at
last
i
have
found
thee
finn
son
of
then
finn
said
what
is
thy
land
and
race
maiden
and
what
dost
thou
seek
from
me
my
name
she
said
is
niam
of
the
golden
hair
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
land
of
youth
and
that
which
has
brought
me
here
is
the
love
of
thy
son
then
she
turned
to
oisīn
and
she
spoke
to
him
in
the
voice
of
one
who
has
never
asked
anything
but
it
was
granted
to
her
wilt
thou
go
with
me
oisīn
to
my
father
s
land
and
oisīn
said
that
will
i
and
to
the
world
s
end
for
the
fairy
spell
had
so
wrought
upon
his
heart
that
he
cared
no
more
for
any
earthly
thing
but
to
have
the
love
of
niam
of
the
head
of
gold
then
the
maiden
spoke
of
the
land
oversea
to
which
she
had
summoned
her
lover
and
as
she
spoke
a
dreamy
stillness
fell
on
all
things
nor
did
a
horse
shake
his
bit
nor
a
hound
bay
nor
the
least
breath
of
wind
stir
in
the
forest
trees
till
she
had
made
an
end
and
what
she
said
seemed
sweeter
and
more
wonderful
as
she
spoke
it
than
anything
they
could
afterwards
remember
to
have
heard
but
so
far
as
they
could
remember
it
it
was
this
delightful
is
the
land
beyond
all
dreams
fairer
than
aught
thine
eyes
have
ever
seen
there
all
the
year
the
fruit
is
on
the
tree
and
all
the
year
the
bloom
is
on
the
flower
there
with
wild
honey
drip
the
forest
trees
the
stores
of
wine
and
mead
shall
never
fail
nor
pain
nor
sickness
knows
the
dweller
there
death
and
decay
come
near
him
never
more
the
feast
shall
cloy
not
nor
the
chase
shall
tire
nor
music
cease
for
ever
through
the
hall
the
gold
and
jewels
of
the
land
of
youth
outshine
all
splendours
ever
dreamed
by
man
thou
shalt
have
horses
of
the
fairy
breed
thou
shalt
have
hounds
that
can
outrun
the
wind
a
hundred
chiefs
shall
follow
thee
in
war
a
hundred
maidens
sing
thee
to
thy
sleep
a
crown
of
sovranty
thy
brow
shall
wear
and
by
thy
side
a
magic
blade
shall
hang
and
thou
shalt
be
lord
of
all
the
land
of
youth
and
lord
of
niam
of
the
head
of
as
the
magic
song
ended
the
fians
beheld
oisīn
mount
the
fairy
steed
and
hold
the
maiden
in
his
arms
and
ere
they
could
stir
or
speak
she
turned
her
horse
s
head
and
shook
the
ringing
bridle
and
down
the
forest
glade
they
fled
as
a
beam
of
light
flies
over
the
land
when
clouds
drive
across
the
sun
and
never
did
the
fianna
behold
oisīn
son
of
finn
on
earth
again
yet
what
befell
him
afterwards
is
known
as
his
birth
was
strange
so
was
his
end
for
he
saw
the
wonders
of
the
land
of
youth
with
mortal
eyes
and
lived
to
tell
them
with
mortal
lips
journey
to
when
the
white
horse
with
its
riders
reached
the
sea
it
ran
lightly
over
the
waves
and
soon
the
green
woods
and
headlands
of
erin
faded
out
of
sight
and
now
the
sun
shone
fiercely
down
and
the
riders
passed
into
a
golden
haze
in
which
oisīn
lost
all
knowledge
of
where
he
was
or
if
sea
or
dry
land
were
beneath
his
horse
s
hoofs
but
strange
sights
sometimes
appeared
to
them
in
the
mist
for
towers
and
palace
gateways
loomed
up
and
disappeared
and
once
a
hornless
doe
bounded
by
them
chased
by
a
white
hound
with
one
red
ear
and
again
they
saw
a
young
maid
ride
by
on
a
brown
steed
bearing
a
golden
apple
in
her
hand
and
close
behind
her
followed
a
young
horseman
on
a
white
steed
a
purple
cloak
floating
at
his
back
and
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
oisīn
would
have
asked
the
princess
who
and
what
these
apparitions
were
but
niam
bade
him
ask
nothing
nor
seem
to
notice
any
phantom
they
might
see
until
they
were
come
to
the
land
of
youth
s
the
story
goes
on
to
tell
how
oisīn
met
with
various
adventures
in
the
land
of
youth
including
the
rescue
of
an
imprisoned
princess
from
a
fomorian
giant
but
at
last
after
what
seemed
to
him
a
sojourn
of
three
weeks
in
the
land
of
youth
he
was
satiated
with
delights
of
every
kind
and
longed
to
visit
his
native
land
again
and
to
see
his
old
comrades
he
promised
to
return
when
he
had
done
so
and
niam
gave
him
the
white
fairy
steed
that
had
borne
him
across
the
sea
to
fairyland
but
charged
him
that
when
he
had
reached
the
land
of
erin
again
he
must
never
alight
from
its
back
nor
touch
the
soil
of
the
earthly
world
with
his
foot
or
the
way
of
return
to
the
land
of
youth
would
be
barred
to
him
for
ever
oisīn
then
set
forth
and
once
more
crossed
the
mystic
ocean
finding
himself
at
last
on
the
western
shores
of
ireland
here
he
made
at
once
for
the
hill
of
allen
where
the
dūn
of
finn
was
wont
to
be
but
marvelled
as
he
traversed
the
woods
that
he
met
no
sign
of
the
fian
hunters
and
at
the
small
size
of
the
folk
whom
he
saw
tilling
the
ground
at
length
coming
from
the
forest
path
into
the
great
clearing
where
the
hill
of
allen
was
wont
to
rise
broad
and
green
with
its
rampart
enclosing
many
dwellings
and
the
great
hall
towering
high
in
the
midst
he
saw
but
grassy
mounds
overgrown
with
rank
weeds
and
whin
bushes
and
among
them
pastured
a
peasant
s
kine
then
a
strange
horror
fell
upon
him
and
he
thought
some
enchantment
from
the
land
of
faëry
held
his
eyes
and
mocked
him
with
false
visions
he
threw
his
arms
abroad
and
shouted
the
names
of
finn
and
oscar
but
none
replied
and
he
thought
that
perchance
the
hounds
might
hear
him
so
he
cried
upon
bran
and
skolawn
and
strained
his
ears
if
they
might
catch
the
faintest
rustle
or
whisper
of
the
world
from
the
sight
of
which
his
eyes
were
holden
but
he
heard
only
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
whins
then
he
rode
in
terror
from
that
place
setting
his
face
towards
the
eastern
sea
for
he
meant
to
traverse
ireland
from
side
to
side
and
end
to
end
in
search
of
some
escape
from
his
enchantment
broken
but
when
he
came
near
to
the
eastern
sea
and
was
now
in
the
place
which
is
called
the
valley
of
the
thrushes
he
saw
in
a
field
upon
the
hillside
a
crowd
of
men
striving
to
roll
aside
a
great
boulder
from
their
tilled
land
and
an
overseer
directing
them
towards
them
he
rode
meaning
to
ask
them
concerning
finn
and
the
fianna
as
he
came
near
they
all
stopped
their
work
to
gaze
upon
him
for
to
them
he
appeared
like
a
messenger
of
the
fairy
folk
or
an
angel
from
heaven
taller
and
mightier
he
was
than
the
they
knew
with
eyes
and
brown
ruddy
cheeks
in
his
mouth
as
it
were
a
shower
of
pearls
and
bright
hair
clustered
beneath
the
rim
of
his
helmet
and
as
oisīn
looked
upon
their
puny
forms
marred
by
toil
and
care
and
at
the
stone
which
they
feebly
strove
to
heave
from
its
bed
he
was
filled
with
pity
and
thought
to
himself
not
such
were
even
the
churls
of
erin
when
i
left
them
for
the
land
of
youth
and
he
stooped
from
his
saddle
to
help
them
he
set
his
hand
to
the
boulder
and
with
a
mighty
heave
he
lifted
it
from
where
it
lay
and
set
it
rolling
down
the
hill
and
the
men
raised
a
shout
of
wonder
and
applause
but
their
shouting
changed
in
a
moment
into
cries
of
terror
and
dismay
and
they
fled
jostling
and
overthrowing
each
other
to
escape
from
the
place
of
fear
for
a
marvel
horrible
to
see
had
taken
place
for
oisīn
s
had
burst
as
he
heaved
the
stone
and
he
fell
headlong
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
the
white
steed
had
vanished
from
their
eyes
like
a
wreath
of
mist
and
that
which
rose
feeble
and
staggering
from
the
ground
was
no
youthful
warrior
but
a
man
stricken
with
extreme
old
age
and
withered
who
stretched
out
groping
hands
and
moaned
with
feeble
and
bitter
cries
and
his
crimson
cloak
and
yellow
silken
tunic
were
now
but
coarse
homespun
stuff
tied
with
a
hempen
girdle
and
the
sword
was
a
rough
oaken
staff
such
as
a
beggar
carries
who
wanders
the
roads
from
farmer
s
house
to
house
when
the
people
saw
that
the
doom
that
had
been
wrought
was
not
for
them
they
returned
and
found
the
old
man
prone
on
the
ground
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
arms
so
they
lifted
him
up
and
asked
who
he
was
and
what
had
befallen
him
oisīn
gazed
round
on
them
with
dim
eyes
and
at
last
he
said
i
was
oisīn
the
son
of
finn
and
i
pray
ye
tell
me
where
he
dwells
for
his
dūn
on
the
hill
of
allen
is
now
a
desolation
and
i
have
neither
seen
him
nor
heard
his
from
the
western
to
the
eastern
then
the
men
gazed
strangely
on
each
other
and
on
oisīn
and
the
overseer
asked
of
what
finn
dost
thou
speak
for
there
be
many
of
that
name
in
erin
oisīn
said
surely
of
finn
mac
cumhal
mac
trenmōr
captain
of
the
fianna
of
then
the
overseer
said
thou
art
daft
old
man
and
thou
hast
made
us
daft
to
take
thee
for
a
youth
as
we
did
a
while
agone
but
we
at
least
have
now
our
wits
again
and
we
know
that
finn
son
of
cumhal
and
all
his
generation
have
been
dead
these
three
hundred
years
at
the
battle
of
gowra
fell
oscar
son
of
oisīn
and
finn
at
the
battle
of
brea
as
the
historians
tell
us
and
the
lays
of
oisīn
whose
death
no
man
knows
the
manner
of
are
sung
by
our
harpers
at
great
men
s
feasts
but
now
the
talkenn
patrick
has
come
into
ireland
and
has
preached
to
us
the
one
god
and
christ
his
son
by
whose
might
these
old
days
and
ways
are
done
away
with
and
finn
and
his
fianna
with
their
feasting
and
hunting
and
songs
of
war
and
of
love
have
no
such
reverence
among
us
as
the
monks
and
virgins
of
holy
patrick
and
the
psalms
and
prayers
that
go
up
daily
to
cleanse
us
from
sin
and
to
save
us
from
the
fire
of
but
oisīn
replied
only
half
hearing
and
still
less
comprehending
what
was
said
to
him
if
thy
god
have
slain
finn
and
oscar
i
would
say
that
god
is
a
strong
then
they
all
cried
out
upon
him
and
some
picked
up
stones
but
the
overseer
bade
them
let
him
be
until
the
talkenn
had
spoken
with
him
and
till
he
should
order
what
was
to
be
done
and
so
they
brought
him
to
patrick
who
treated
him
gently
and
hospitably
and
to
patrick
he
told
the
story
of
all
that
had
befallen
him
but
patrick
bade
his
scribes
write
all
carefully
down
that
the
memory
of
the
heroes
whom
oisīn
had
known
and
of
the
joyous
and
free
life
they
had
led
in
the
woods
and
glens
and
wild
places
of
erin
should
never
be
forgotten
among
men
this
remarkable
legend
is
known
only
in
the
modern
irish
poem
written
by
michael
comyn
about
a
poem
which
may
be
called
the
of
irish
literature
doubtless
comyn
worked
on
earlier
traditional
material
but
though
the
ancient
ossianic
poems
tell
us
of
the
prolongation
of
oisīn
s
life
so
that
he
could
meet
patrick
and
tell
him
stories
of
the
fianna
the
episodes
of
niam
s
courtship
and
the
sojourn
in
the
land
of
youth
are
known
to
us
at
present
only
in
the
poem
of
michael
comyn
enchanted
this
tale
which
i
take
from
o
grady
s
edition
in
silva
gadelica
relates
that
finn
once
made
a
great
hunting
in
the
district
of
corann
in
northern
connacht
which
was
ruled
over
by
one
conaran
a
lord
of
the
danaan
folk
angered
at
the
intrusion
of
the
fianna
in
his
he
sent
his
three
to
take
vengeance
on
the
mortals
finn
it
is
said
and
conan
the
bald
with
finn
s
two
favourite
hounds
were
watching
the
hunt
from
the
top
of
the
hill
of
keshcorran
and
listening
to
the
cries
of
the
beaters
and
the
notes
of
the
horn
and
the
baying
of
the
dogs
when
in
moving
about
on
the
hill
they
came
upon
the
mouth
of
a
great
cavern
before
which
sat
three
hags
of
evil
and
revolting
aspect
on
three
crooked
sticks
of
holly
they
had
twisted
hanks
of
yarn
and
were
spinning
with
these
when
finn
and
his
followers
arrived
to
view
them
more
closely
the
warriors
drew
near
when
they
found
themselves
suddenly
entangled
in
strands
of
the
yarn
which
the
hags
had
spun
about
the
place
like
the
web
of
a
spider
and
deadly
faintness
and
trembling
came
over
them
so
that
they
were
easily
bound
fast
by
the
hags
and
carried
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
cave
others
of
the
party
then
arrived
looking
for
finn
all
suffered
the
same
lost
all
their
pith
and
valour
at
the
touch
of
the
bewitched
yarn
and
were
bound
and
carried
into
the
cave
until
the
whole
party
were
laid
in
bonds
with
the
dogs
baying
and
howling
outside
the
witches
now
seized
their
sharp
swords
and
were
about
to
fall
on
the
captives
and
slay
them
but
first
they
looked
round
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
to
see
if
there
was
any
straggler
whom
they
had
not
yet
laid
hold
of
at
this
moment
goll
mac
morna
the
raging
lion
the
torch
of
onset
the
great
of
soul
came
up
and
a
desperate
combat
ensued
which
ended
by
goll
cleaving
two
of
the
hags
in
twain
and
then
subduing
and
binding
the
third
whose
name
was
irnan
she
as
he
was
about
to
slay
her
begged
for
surely
it
were
better
for
thee
to
have
the
fianna
whole
he
gave
her
her
life
if
she
would
release
the
prisoners
into
the
cave
they
went
and
one
by
one
the
captives
were
unbound
beginning
with
the
poet
fergus
truelips
and
the
men
of
science
and
they
all
sat
down
on
the
hill
to
recover
themselves
while
fergus
sang
a
chant
of
praise
in
honour
of
the
rescuer
goll
and
irnan
disappeared
ere
long
a
monster
was
seen
approaching
them
a
gnarled
hag
with
blazing
bloodshot
eyes
a
yawning
mouth
full
of
ragged
fangs
nails
like
a
wild
beast
s
and
armed
like
a
warrior
she
laid
finn
under
to
provide
her
with
single
combat
from
among
his
men
until
she
should
have
her
fill
of
it
it
was
no
other
than
the
third
sister
irnan
whom
goll
had
spared
finn
in
vain
begged
oisīn
oscar
keelta
and
the
other
prime
warriors
of
the
fianna
to
meet
her
they
all
pleaded
inability
after
the
and
contumely
they
had
received
at
last
as
finn
himself
was
about
to
do
battle
with
her
goll
said
o
finn
combat
with
a
crone
beseems
thee
not
and
he
drew
sword
for
a
second
battle
with
this
horrible
enemy
at
last
after
a
desperate
combat
he
ran
her
through
her
shield
and
through
her
heart
so
that
the
blade
stuck
out
at
the
far
side
and
she
fell
dead
the
fianna
then
sacked
the
dūn
of
conaran
and
took
possession
of
all
the
treasure
in
it
while
finn
bestowed
on
goll
mac
morna
his
own
daughter
keva
of
the
white
skin
and
leaving
the
dūn
a
heap
of
glowing
embers
they
returned
to
the
hill
of
allen
chase
of
this
fine
story
which
is
given
in
poetical
form
as
if
narrated
by
oisīn
in
the
ossianic
society
s
transactions
tells
how
cullan
the
smith
here
represented
as
a
danaan
divinity
who
dwelt
on
or
near
the
mountains
of
slievegallion
in
armagh
had
two
daughters
ainé
and
milucra
each
of
whom
loved
finn
mac
cumhal
they
were
jealous
of
each
other
and
on
ainé
once
happening
to
say
that
she
would
never
have
a
man
with
grey
hair
milucra
saw
a
means
of
securing
finn
s
love
entirely
for
herself
so
she
assembled
her
friends
among
the
danaans
round
the
little
grey
lake
that
lies
on
the
top
of
slievegallion
and
they
charged
its
waters
with
enchantments
this
introduction
it
may
be
observed
bears
strong
signs
of
being
a
later
addition
to
the
original
tale
made
in
a
less
understanding
age
or
by
a
less
thoughtful
class
into
whose
hands
the
legend
had
descended
the
real
meaning
of
the
transformation
which
it
narrates
is
probably
much
deeper
the
story
goes
on
to
say
that
not
long
after
this
the
hounds
of
finn
bran
and
skolawn
started
a
fawn
near
the
hill
of
allen
and
ran
it
northwards
till
the
chase
ended
on
the
top
of
slievegallion
a
mountain
which
like
slievenamon
in
the
south
was
in
ancient
ireland
a
veritable
focus
of
danaan
magic
and
legendary
lore
finn
followed
the
hounds
alone
till
the
fawn
disappeared
on
the
in
searching
for
it
finn
at
last
came
on
the
little
lake
which
lies
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
saw
by
its
brink
a
lady
of
wonderful
beauty
who
sat
there
lamenting
and
weeping
finn
asked
her
the
cause
of
her
grief
she
explained
that
a
gold
ring
which
she
dearly
prized
had
fallen
from
her
finger
into
the
lake
and
she
charged
finn
by
the
bonds
of
that
he
should
plunge
in
and
find
it
for
her
finn
did
so
and
after
diving
into
every
recess
of
the
lake
he
discovered
the
ring
and
before
leaving
the
water
gave
it
to
the
lady
she
immediately
plunged
into
the
lake
and
disappeared
finn
then
surmised
that
some
enchantment
was
being
wrought
on
him
and
ere
long
he
knew
what
it
was
for
on
stepping
forth
on
dry
land
he
fell
down
from
sheer
weakness
and
arose
again
a
tottering
and
feeble
old
man
and
withered
so
that
even
his
faithful
hounds
did
not
know
him
but
ran
round
the
lake
searching
for
their
lost
master
meantime
finn
was
missed
from
his
palace
on
the
hill
of
allen
and
a
party
soon
set
out
on
the
track
on
which
he
had
been
seen
to
chase
the
deer
they
came
to
the
on
slievegallion
and
found
there
a
wretched
and
palsied
old
man
whom
they
questioned
but
who
could
do
nothing
but
beat
his
breast
and
moan
at
last
beckoning
keelta
to
come
near
the
aged
man
whispered
faintly
some
words
into
his
ear
and
lo
it
was
finn
himself
when
the
fianna
had
ceased
from
their
cries
of
wonder
and
lamentation
finn
whispered
to
keelta
the
tale
of
his
enchantment
and
told
them
that
the
author
of
it
must
be
the
daughter
of
cullan
the
smith
who
dwelt
in
the
fairy
mound
of
slievegallion
the
fianna
bearing
finn
on
a
litter
immediately
went
to
the
mound
and
began
to
dig
fiercely
for
three
days
and
nights
they
dug
at
the
fairy
mound
and
at
last
penetrated
to
its
inmost
recesses
when
a
maiden
suddenly
stood
before
them
holding
a
of
red
gold
it
was
given
to
finn
he
drank
from
it
and
at
once
his
beauty
and
form
were
restored
to
him
but
his
hair
still
remained
white
as
silver
this
too
would
have
been
restored
by
another
draught
but
finn
let
it
stay
as
it
was
and
his
hair
remained
to
the
day
of
his
death
the
tale
has
been
made
the
subject
of
a
very
striking
allegorical
drama
the
masque
of
finn
by
standish
o
grady
who
rightly
no
doubt
interprets
the
story
as
symbolising
the
acquisition
of
wisdom
and
understanding
through
suffering
a
leader
of
men
must
descend
into
the
lake
of
tears
and
know
feebleness
and
despair
before
his
spirit
can
sway
them
to
great
ends
there
is
an
antique
sepulchral
monument
on
the
which
the
peasantry
of
the
district
still
did
in
the
days
before
board
the
abode
of
the
witch
of
the
lake
and
a
mysterious
beaten
path
which
was
never
worn
by
the
passage
of
human
feet
and
which
leads
from
the
rock
sepulchre
to
the
is
ascribed
to
the
going
to
and
fro
of
this
supernatural
being
of
the
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
attractive
of
the
relics
of
ossianic
literature
is
the
colloquy
of
the
ancients
na
a
long
narrative
piece
dating
from
about
the
thirteenth
century
it
has
been
published
with
a
translation
in
o
grady
s
silva
it
is
not
so
much
a
story
as
a
collection
of
stories
skilfully
set
in
a
mythical
framework
the
colloquy
opens
by
presenting
us
with
the
figures
of
keelta
mac
ronan
and
oisīn
son
of
finn
each
accompanied
by
eight
warriors
all
that
are
left
of
the
great
fellowship
of
the
fianna
after
the
battle
of
gowra
and
the
subsequent
dispersion
of
the
order
a
vivid
picture
is
given
us
of
the
grey
old
warriors
who
had
outlived
their
epoch
meeting
for
the
last
time
at
the
dūn
of
a
once
famous
chieftainess
named
camha
and
of
their
melancholy
talk
over
bygone
days
till
at
last
a
long
silence
settled
on
them
meets
finally
keelta
and
oisīn
resolve
to
part
oisīn
of
whom
we
hear
little
more
going
to
the
fairy
mound
where
his
danaan
mother
here
called
blai
has
her
dwelling
while
keelta
takes
his
way
over
the
plains
of
meath
till
he
comes
to
drumderg
where
he
lights
on
patrick
and
his
monks
how
this
is
chronologically
possible
the
writer
does
not
trouble
himself
to
explain
and
he
shows
no
knowledge
of
the
legend
of
oisīn
in
the
land
of
youth
the
clerics
says
the
story
saw
keelta
and
his
band
draw
near
them
and
fear
fell
on
them
before
the
tall
men
with
the
huge
that
accompanied
them
for
they
were
not
people
of
one
epoch
or
of
one
time
with
the
patrick
then
sprinkles
the
heroes
with
holy
water
whereat
legions
of
demons
who
had
been
hovering
over
them
fly
away
into
the
hills
and
glens
and
the
enormous
men
sat
patrick
after
inquiring
the
name
of
his
guest
then
says
he
has
a
boon
to
crave
of
wishes
to
find
a
well
of
pure
water
with
which
to
baptize
the
folk
of
bregia
and
of
meath
well
of
keelta
who
knows
every
brook
and
hill
and
rath
and
wood
in
the
country
thereon
takes
patrick
by
the
hand
and
leads
him
away
till
as
the
writer
says
right
in
front
of
them
they
saw
a
sparkling
and
translucid
the
size
and
thickness
of
the
cress
and
of
the
or
brooklime
that
grew
on
it
was
a
wonderment
to
then
keelta
began
to
tell
of
the
fame
and
qualities
of
the
place
and
uttered
an
exquisite
little
lyric
in
praise
of
it
o
well
of
the
strand
of
the
two
women
beautiful
are
thy
cresses
luxuriant
branching
since
thy
produce
is
neglected
on
thee
thy
brooklime
is
not
suffered
to
grow
forth
from
thy
banks
thy
trout
are
to
be
seen
thy
wild
swine
in
the
wilderness
the
deer
of
thy
fair
hunting
thy
dappled
and
fawns
thy
mast
all
hanging
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
thy
fish
in
estuaries
of
the
rivers
lovely
the
colours
of
thy
purling
streams
o
thou
that
art
and
again
green
with
reflections
of
surrounding
patrick
and
irish
after
the
warriors
have
been
entertained
patrick
asks
was
he
finn
mac
cumhal
a
good
lord
with
whom
ye
were
keelta
praises
the
generosity
of
finn
and
goes
on
to
describe
in
detail
the
glories
of
his
household
whereon
patrick
says
were
it
not
for
us
an
impairing
of
the
devout
life
an
occasion
of
neglecting
prayer
and
of
deserting
converse
with
god
we
as
we
talked
with
thee
would
feel
the
time
pass
quickly
warrior
keelta
goes
on
with
another
tale
of
the
fianna
and
patrick
now
fairly
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
enchanter
cries
success
and
benediction
attend
thee
keelta
this
is
to
me
a
lightening
of
spirit
and
mind
and
now
tell
us
another
so
ends
the
exordium
of
the
as
usual
in
the
openings
of
irish
tales
nothing
could
be
better
contrived
the
touch
is
so
light
there
is
so
happy
a
mingling
of
pathos
poetry
and
humour
and
so
much
dignity
in
the
sketching
of
the
human
characters
introduced
the
rest
of
the
piece
consists
in
the
exhibition
of
a
vast
amount
of
topographical
and
legendary
lore
by
keelta
attended
by
the
invariable
success
and
benediction
attend
thee
of
patrick
they
move
together
the
warrior
and
the
saint
on
patrick
s
journey
to
tara
and
whenever
patrick
or
some
one
else
in
the
company
sees
a
hill
or
a
fort
or
a
well
he
asks
keelta
what
it
is
and
keelta
tells
its
name
and
a
fian
legend
to
account
for
it
and
so
the
story
wanders
on
through
a
maze
of
legendary
lore
until
they
are
met
by
a
company
from
tara
with
the
king
at
its
head
who
then
takes
up
the
of
questioner
the
colloquy
as
we
have
it
now
breaks
off
abruptly
as
the
story
how
the
was
carried
off
from
ireland
is
about
to
be
narrated
the
interest
of
the
colloquy
lies
in
the
tales
of
keelta
and
the
lyrics
introduced
in
the
course
of
them
of
the
tales
there
are
about
a
hundred
telling
of
fian
raids
and
battles
and
and
feastings
but
the
greater
number
of
them
have
to
do
with
the
intercourse
between
the
fairy
folk
and
the
fianna
with
these
folk
the
fianna
have
constant
relations
both
of
love
and
of
war
some
of
the
tales
are
of
great
elaboration
wrought
out
in
the
highest
style
of
which
the
writer
was
capable
one
of
the
best
is
that
of
the
fairy
or
mansion
of
slievenamon
which
patrick
and
keelta
chance
to
pass
by
and
of
which
keelta
tells
the
following
history
brugh
of
one
day
as
finn
and
keelta
and
five
other
champions
of
the
fianna
were
hunting
at
torach
in
the
north
they
roused
a
beautiful
fawn
which
fled
before
them
they
holding
it
in
chase
all
day
till
they
reached
the
mountain
of
slievenamon
towards
evening
when
the
fawn
suddenly
seemed
to
vanish
underground
a
chase
like
this
in
the
ossianic
literature
is
the
common
prelude
to
an
adventure
in
fairyland
night
now
fell
rapidly
and
with
it
came
heavy
snow
and
storm
and
searching
for
shelter
the
fianna
discovered
in
the
wood
a
great
illuminated
or
mansion
where
they
sought
admittance
on
entering
they
found
themselves
in
a
spacious
hall
full
of
light
with
warriors
and
as
many
fair
and
maidens
one
of
the
latter
seated
on
a
chair
of
crystal
and
making
wonderful
music
on
a
harp
after
the
fian
warriors
have
been
entertained
with
the
finest
of
viands
and
liquors
it
is
explained
to
them
that
their
hosts
are
donn
son
of
midir
the
proud
and
his
brother
and
that
they
are
at
war
with
the
rest
of
the
danaan
folk
and
have
to
do
battle
with
them
thrice
yearly
on
the
green
before
the
at
first
each
of
the
had
a
thousand
warriors
under
him
now
all
are
slain
except
those
present
and
the
survivors
have
sent
out
one
of
their
maidens
in
the
shape
of
a
fawn
to
entice
the
fianna
to
their
fairy
palace
and
to
gain
their
aid
in
the
battle
that
must
be
delivered
we
have
in
fact
a
variant
of
the
theme
of
the
rescue
of
fairyland
finn
and
his
companions
are
always
ready
for
a
fray
and
a
desperate
battle
ensues
which
lasts
from
evening
till
morning
for
the
fairy
host
attack
at
night
the
assailants
are
beaten
off
losing
over
a
thousand
of
their
number
but
oscar
dermot
and
mac
luga
are
sorely
wounded
they
are
healed
by
magical
herbs
and
more
fighting
and
other
adventures
follow
until
after
a
year
has
passed
finn
compels
the
enemy
to
make
peace
and
give
hostages
when
the
fianna
return
to
earth
and
rejoin
their
fellows
no
sooner
has
keelta
finished
his
tale
standing
on
the
very
spot
where
they
had
found
the
fairy
palace
on
the
night
of
snow
than
a
young
warrior
is
seen
approaching
them
he
is
thus
described
a
shirt
of
royal
satin
was
next
his
skin
over
and
outside
it
a
tunic
of
the
same
fabric
and
a
fringed
crimson
mantle
confined
with
a
bodkin
of
gold
upon
his
breast
in
his
hand
a
sword
and
a
golden
helmet
on
his
a
delight
in
the
colour
and
material
splendour
of
life
is
a
very
marked
feature
in
all
this
literature
this
splendid
figure
turns
out
to
be
donn
mac
midir
one
of
the
whom
finn
had
succoured
and
he
comes
to
do
homage
for
himself
and
his
people
to
patrick
who
accepts
entertainment
from
him
for
the
night
for
in
the
colloquy
the
relations
of
the
church
and
of
the
fairy
world
are
very
cordial
three
young
nowhere
in
celtic
literature
does
the
love
of
wonder
and
mystery
find
such
remarkable
expression
as
in
the
the
writer
of
this
piece
was
a
master
of
the
touch
that
makes
as
it
were
the
solid
framework
of
things
translucent
and
shows
us
through
it
gleams
of
another
world
mingled
with
ours
yet
distinct
and
having
other
laws
and
characteristics
we
never
get
a
clue
as
to
what
these
laws
are
the
celt
did
not
in
ireland
at
least
systematise
the
unknown
but
let
it
shine
for
a
moment
through
the
opaqueness
of
this
earth
and
then
withdrew
the
gleam
before
we
understood
what
we
had
seen
take
for
instance
this
incident
in
keelta
s
account
of
the
fianna
three
young
warriors
come
to
take
service
with
finn
accompanied
by
a
gigantic
hound
they
make
their
agreement
with
him
saying
what
services
they
can
render
and
what
reward
they
expect
and
they
make
it
a
condition
that
they
shall
camp
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
host
and
that
when
night
has
fallen
no
man
shall
come
near
them
or
see
them
finn
asks
the
reason
for
this
prohibition
and
it
is
this
of
the
three
warriors
one
has
to
die
each
night
and
the
other
two
must
watch
him
therefore
they
would
not
be
disturbed
there
is
no
explanation
of
this
the
writer
simply
leaves
us
with
the
thrill
of
the
mystery
upon
us
fair
again
let
us
turn
to
the
tale
of
the
fair
giantess
one
day
finn
and
his
warriors
while
resting
from
the
chase
for
their
midday
meal
saw
coming
towards
them
a
towering
shape
it
proved
to
be
a
young
giant
maiden
who
gave
her
name
as
vivionn
bebhionn
daughter
of
treon
from
the
land
of
maidens
the
gold
rings
on
her
fingers
were
as
thick
as
an
ox
s
yoke
and
her
beauty
was
dazzling
when
she
took
off
her
gilded
helmet
all
bejewelled
her
fair
curling
golden
hair
broke
out
in
seven
score
tresses
and
finn
cried
great
gods
whom
we
adore
a
huge
marvel
cormac
and
ethné
and
the
women
of
the
fianna
would
esteem
it
to
see
vivionn
the
blooming
daughter
of
the
maiden
explained
that
she
had
been
betrothed
against
her
will
to
a
suitor
named
æda
son
of
a
neighbouring
king
and
that
hearing
from
a
fisherman
who
had
been
blown
to
her
shores
of
the
power
and
nobleness
of
finn
she
had
come
to
seek
his
protection
while
she
was
speaking
suddenly
the
fianna
were
aware
of
another
giant
form
close
at
hand
it
was
a
young
man
and
of
surpassing
beauty
who
bore
a
red
shield
and
a
huge
spear
without
a
word
he
drew
near
and
before
the
wondering
fianna
could
accost
him
he
thrust
his
spear
through
the
body
of
the
maiden
and
passed
away
finn
enraged
at
this
violation
of
his
protection
called
on
his
chiefs
to
pursue
and
slay
the
murderer
keelta
and
others
chased
him
to
the
and
followed
him
into
the
surf
but
he
strode
out
to
sea
and
was
met
by
a
great
galley
which
bore
him
away
to
unknown
regions
returning
discomfited
to
finn
they
found
the
girl
dying
she
distributed
her
gold
and
jewels
among
them
and
the
fianna
buried
her
under
a
great
mound
and
raised
a
pillar
stone
over
her
with
her
name
in
ogham
letters
in
the
place
since
called
the
ridge
of
the
dead
woman
in
this
tale
we
have
besides
the
element
of
mystery
that
of
beauty
it
is
an
association
of
frequent
occurrence
in
this
period
of
celtic
literature
and
to
this
perhaps
is
due
the
fact
that
although
these
tales
seem
to
come
from
nowhither
and
to
lead
nowhither
but
move
in
a
where
there
is
no
chase
but
seems
to
end
in
fairyland
and
no
combat
that
has
any
relation
to
earthly
needs
or
objects
where
all
realities
are
apt
to
dissolve
in
a
magic
light
and
to
change
their
shapes
like
morning
mist
yet
they
linger
in
the
memory
with
that
haunting
charm
which
has
for
many
centuries
kept
them
alive
by
the
fireside
of
the
gaelic
peasant
patrick
oisīn
and
before
we
leave
the
colloquy
another
interesting
point
must
be
mentioned
in
connexion
with
it
to
the
general
public
probably
the
things
in
ossianic
refer
of
course
to
the
true
gaelic
poetry
which
goes
under
that
name
not
to
the
of
those
dialogues
in
which
the
pagan
and
the
christian
ideals
are
contrasted
often
in
a
spirit
of
humorous
exaggeration
or
of
satire
the
earliest
of
these
pieces
are
found
in
the
manuscript
called
the
dean
of
lismore
s
book
in
which
james
macgregor
dean
of
lismore
in
argyllshire
wrote
down
some
time
before
the
year
all
he
could
remember
or
discover
of
traditional
gaelic
poetry
in
his
time
it
may
be
observed
that
up
to
this
period
and
indeed
long
after
it
scottish
and
irish
gaelic
were
one
language
and
one
literature
the
great
written
monuments
of
which
were
in
ireland
though
they
belonged
just
as
much
to
the
highland
celt
and
the
two
branches
of
the
gael
had
an
absolutely
common
stock
of
poetic
tradition
these
dialogues
are
found
in
abundance
both
in
ireland
and
in
the
highlands
though
as
i
have
said
the
dean
of
lismore
s
book
is
their
first
written
record
now
extant
what
relation
then
do
these
dialogues
bear
to
the
dialogues
with
which
we
make
acquaintance
in
the
colloquy
the
questions
which
really
came
first
where
they
respectively
originated
and
what
current
of
thought
or
sentiment
each
represented
constitute
as
alfred
nutt
has
pointed
out
a
literary
problem
of
the
greatest
interest
and
one
which
no
critic
has
yet
attempted
to
solve
or
indeed
until
quite
lately
even
to
call
attention
to
for
though
these
two
attempts
to
represent
in
imaginative
and
artistic
form
the
contact
of
paganism
with
christianity
are
nearly
identical
in
machinery
and
framework
save
that
one
is
in
verse
and
the
other
in
prose
yet
they
differ
widely
in
their
point
of
view
in
the
oisīn
dialogues
there
is
a
great
deal
of
rough
humour
and
of
crude
theology
resembling
those
of
an
english
rather
than
any
celtic
product
that
i
am
acquainted
with
patrick
in
these
ballads
as
nutt
remarks
is
a
sour
and
stupid
fanatic
harping
with
wearisome
monotony
on
the
damnation
of
finn
and
all
his
comrades
a
hard
taskmaster
to
the
poor
old
blind
giant
to
whom
he
grudges
food
and
upon
whom
he
plays
shabby
tricks
in
order
to
terrify
him
into
acceptance
of
now
in
the
colloquy
there
is
not
one
word
of
all
this
keelta
embraces
christianity
with
a
wholehearted
reverence
and
salvation
is
not
denied
to
the
friends
and
companions
of
his
youth
patrick
indeed
assures
keelta
of
the
salvation
of
several
of
them
including
finn
himself
one
of
the
danaan
folk
who
has
been
bard
to
the
fianna
delighted
patrick
with
his
minstrelsy
brogan
the
scribe
whom
patrick
is
employing
to
write
down
the
fian
legends
says
if
music
there
is
in
heaven
why
should
there
not
be
on
earth
wherefore
it
is
not
right
to
banish
patrick
made
answer
neither
say
i
any
such
thing
and
in
fact
the
minstrel
is
promised
heaven
for
his
art
such
are
the
pleasant
relations
that
prevail
in
the
colloquy
between
the
representatives
of
the
two
epochs
keelta
represents
all
that
is
courteous
dignified
generous
and
valorous
in
paganism
and
patrick
all
that
is
benign
and
gracious
in
christianity
and
instead
of
the
two
epochs
standing
over
against
each
other
in
violent
antagonism
and
separated
by
an
impassable
gulf
all
the
finest
traits
in
each
are
seen
to
harmonise
with
and
to
supplement
those
of
the
other
of
a
number
of
curious
legends
centre
on
dermot
o
dyna
who
has
been
referred
to
as
one
of
finn
mac
cumhal
s
most
notable
followers
he
might
be
described
as
a
kind
of
gaelic
adonis
a
type
of
beauty
and
attraction
the
hero
of
innumerable
love
tales
and
like
adonis
his
death
was
caused
by
a
wild
boar
boar
of
ben
the
boar
was
no
common
beast
the
story
of
its
origin
was
as
follows
dermot
s
father
donn
gave
the
child
to
be
nurtured
by
angus
ōg
in
his
palace
on
the
boyne
his
mother
who
was
unfaithful
to
donn
bore
another
child
to
roc
the
steward
of
angus
donn
one
day
when
the
steward
s
child
ran
between
his
knees
to
escape
from
some
hounds
that
were
fighting
on
the
floor
of
the
hall
gave
him
a
squeeze
with
his
two
knees
that
killed
him
on
the
spot
and
he
then
flung
the
body
among
the
hounds
on
the
floor
when
the
steward
found
his
son
dead
and
discovered
with
finn
s
aid
the
cause
of
it
he
brought
a
druid
rod
and
smote
the
body
with
it
whereupon
in
place
of
the
dead
child
there
arose
a
huge
boar
without
ears
or
tail
and
to
it
he
spake
i
charge
you
to
bring
dermot
o
dyna
to
his
death
and
the
boar
rushed
out
from
the
hall
and
roamed
in
the
forests
of
ben
bulben
in
sligo
till
the
time
when
his
destiny
should
be
fulfilled
but
dermot
grew
up
into
a
splendid
youth
tireless
in
the
chase
undaunted
in
war
beloved
by
all
his
comrades
of
the
fianna
whom
he
joined
as
soon
as
he
was
of
age
to
do
so
dermot
got
the
love
he
was
called
dermot
of
the
love
spot
and
a
curious
and
beautiful
recorded
by
douglas
hyde
tells
how
he
got
this
appellation
with
three
comrades
goll
conan
and
oscar
he
was
hunting
one
day
and
late
at
night
they
sought
a
they
soon
found
a
hut
in
which
were
an
old
man
a
young
girl
a
wether
sheep
and
a
cat
here
they
asked
for
hospitality
and
it
was
granted
to
them
but
as
usual
in
these
tales
it
was
a
house
of
mystery
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
the
wether
got
up
and
mounted
on
the
table
one
after
another
the
fianna
strove
to
throw
it
off
but
it
shook
them
down
on
the
floor
at
last
goll
succeeded
in
flinging
it
off
the
table
but
him
too
it
vanquished
in
the
end
and
put
them
all
under
its
feet
then
the
old
man
bade
the
cat
lead
the
wether
back
and
fasten
it
up
and
it
did
so
easily
the
four
champions
overcome
with
shame
were
for
leaving
the
house
at
once
but
the
old
man
explained
that
they
had
suffered
no
wether
they
had
been
fighting
with
was
the
world
and
the
cat
was
the
power
that
would
destroy
the
world
itself
namely
death
at
night
the
four
heroes
went
to
rest
in
a
large
chamber
and
the
young
maid
came
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
and
it
is
said
that
her
beauty
made
a
light
on
the
walls
of
the
room
like
a
candle
one
after
another
the
fianna
went
over
to
her
couch
but
she
repelled
them
all
i
belonged
to
you
once
she
said
to
each
and
i
never
will
last
of
all
dermot
went
o
dermot
she
said
you
also
i
belonged
to
once
and
i
never
can
again
for
i
am
youth
but
come
here
and
i
will
put
a
mark
on
you
so
that
no
woman
can
ever
see
you
without
loving
then
she
touched
his
forehead
and
left
the
love
spot
there
and
that
drew
the
love
of
women
to
him
as
long
as
he
lived
chase
of
the
hard
the
chase
of
the
gilla
dacar
is
another
fian
tale
in
which
dermot
plays
a
leading
part
the
fianna
the
story
goes
were
hunting
one
day
on
the
hills
and
through
the
woods
of
munster
and
as
finn
and
his
captains
stood
on
a
hillside
listening
to
the
baying
of
the
hounds
and
the
notes
of
the
fian
from
the
dark
wood
below
they
saw
coming
towards
them
a
huge
ugly
misshapen
churl
dragging
along
by
a
halter
a
great
mare
he
announced
himself
as
wishful
to
take
service
with
finn
the
name
he
was
called
by
he
said
was
the
gilla
dacar
the
hard
gilly
because
he
was
the
hardest
servant
ever
a
lord
had
to
get
service
or
obedience
from
in
spite
of
this
unpromising
beginning
finn
whose
principle
it
was
never
to
refuse
any
suitor
took
him
into
service
and
the
fianna
now
began
to
make
their
uncouth
comrade
the
butt
of
all
sorts
of
rough
jokes
which
ended
in
thirteen
of
them
including
conan
the
bald
all
mounting
up
on
the
gilla
dacar
s
steed
on
this
the
newcomer
complained
that
he
was
being
mocked
and
he
shambled
away
in
great
discontent
till
he
was
over
the
ridge
of
the
hill
when
he
tucked
up
his
skirts
and
ran
westwards
faster
than
any
march
wind
toward
the
in
kerry
thereupon
at
once
the
steed
which
had
stood
still
with
drooping
ears
while
the
thirteen
riders
in
vain
belaboured
it
to
make
it
move
suddenly
threw
up
its
head
and
started
off
in
a
furious
gallop
after
its
master
the
fianna
ran
alongside
as
well
as
they
could
for
laughter
while
conan
in
terror
and
rage
reviled
them
for
not
rescuing
him
and
his
comrades
at
last
the
thing
became
serious
the
gilla
dacar
plunged
into
the
sea
and
the
mare
followed
him
with
her
thirteen
riders
and
one
more
who
managed
to
cling
to
her
tail
just
as
she
left
the
shore
and
all
of
them
soon
disappeared
towards
the
fabled
region
of
the
west
at
the
finn
and
the
remaining
fianna
now
took
counsel
together
as
to
what
should
be
done
and
finally
decided
to
fit
out
a
ship
and
go
in
search
of
their
comrades
after
many
days
of
voyaging
they
reached
an
island
guarded
by
precipitous
cliffs
dermot
o
dyna
as
the
most
agile
of
the
party
was
sent
to
climb
them
and
to
discover
if
he
could
some
means
of
helping
up
the
rest
of
the
party
when
he
arrived
at
the
top
he
found
himself
in
a
delightful
land
full
of
the
song
of
birds
and
the
humming
of
bees
and
the
murmur
of
streams
but
with
no
sign
of
habitation
going
into
a
dark
forest
he
soon
came
to
a
well
by
which
hung
a
curiously
wrought
as
he
filled
it
to
drink
a
low
threatening
murmur
came
from
the
well
but
his
thirst
was
too
keen
to
let
him
heed
it
and
he
drank
his
fill
in
no
long
time
there
came
through
the
wood
an
armed
warrior
who
violently
upbraided
him
for
drinking
from
his
well
the
knight
of
the
well
and
dermot
then
fought
all
the
afternoon
without
either
of
them
prevailing
over
the
other
when
as
evening
drew
on
the
knight
suddenly
leaped
into
the
well
and
disappeared
next
day
the
same
thing
happened
on
the
third
however
dermot
as
the
knight
was
about
to
take
his
leap
flung
his
arms
round
him
and
both
went
down
together
rescue
of
dermot
after
a
moment
of
darkness
and
trance
now
found
himself
in
fairyland
a
man
of
noble
appearance
roused
him
and
led
him
away
to
the
castle
of
a
great
king
where
he
was
hospitably
entertained
it
was
explained
to
him
that
the
services
of
a
champion
like
himself
were
needed
to
do
combat
against
a
rival
monarch
of
faëry
it
is
the
same
motive
which
we
find
in
the
adventures
of
cuchulain
with
fand
and
which
so
frequently
turns
up
in
celtic
fairy
lore
finn
and
his
companions
finding
that
dermot
did
not
return
to
them
found
their
way
up
the
cliffs
and
having
traversed
the
forest
entered
a
great
cavern
which
ultimately
led
them
out
to
the
same
land
as
that
in
which
dermot
had
arrived
there
too
they
are
informed
are
the
fourteen
fianna
who
had
been
carried
off
on
the
mare
of
the
hard
gilly
he
of
course
was
the
king
who
needed
their
services
and
who
had
taken
this
method
of
decoying
some
thirty
of
the
flower
of
irish
fighting
men
to
his
side
finn
and
his
men
go
into
the
battle
with
the
best
of
goodwill
and
scatter
the
enemy
like
chaff
oscar
slays
the
son
of
the
rival
king
who
is
called
the
king
of
greece
finn
wins
the
love
of
his
daughter
tasha
of
the
white
arms
and
the
story
closes
with
a
delightful
mixture
of
gaiety
and
mystery
what
reward
wilt
thou
have
for
thy
good
services
asks
the
fairy
king
of
finn
thou
wert
once
in
service
with
me
replies
finn
and
i
mind
not
that
i
gave
thee
any
recompense
let
one

stand
against
the
never
shall
i
agree
to
that
cries
conan
the
bald
shall
i
have
nought
for
being
carried
off
on
thy
wild
mare
and
haled
oversea
what
wilt
thou
have
asks
the
fairy
king
none
of
thy
gold
or
goods
replies
conan
but
mine
honour
hath
suffered
and
let
mine
honour
be
appeased
set
thirteen
of
thy
fairest
womenfolk
on
the
wild
mare
o
king
and
thine
own
wife
clinging
to
her
tail
and
let
them
be
transported
to
erin
in
like
manner
as
we
were
dragged
here
and
i
shall
deem
the
indignity
we
have
suffered
fitly
atoned
on
this
the
king
smiled
and
turning
to
finn
said
o
finn
behold
thy
finn
turned
to
look
at
them
but
when
he
looked
round
again
the
scene
had
fairy
king
and
his
host
and
all
the
world
of
faëry
had
disappeared
and
he
found
himself
with
his
companions
and
the
tasha
standing
on
the
beach
of
the
little
bay
in
kerry
whence
the
hard
gilly
and
the
mare
had
taken
the
water
and
carried
off
his
men
and
then
all
started
with
cheerful
hearts
for
the
great
standing
camp
of
the
fianna
on
the
hill
of
allen
to
celebrate
the
wedding
feast

finn

tasha
of
christianity
on
the
development
of
irish
this
tale
with
its
fascinating
mixture
of
humour
romance
magic
and
love
of
wild
nature
may
be
taken
as
a
typical
specimen
of
the
fian
legends
at
their
best
as
compared
with
the
conorian
legends
they
show
as
i
have
pointed
out
a
characteristic
lack
of
any
heroic
or
serious
element
that
nobler
strain
died
out
with
the
growing
predominance
of
christianity
which
appropriated
for
definitely
religious
purposes
the
more
serious
and
lofty
side
of
the
celtic
genius
leaving
for
secular
literature
only
the
elements
of
wonder
and
romance
so
completely
was
this
carried
out
that
while
the
finn
legends
have
survived
to
this
day
among
the
population
and
were
a
subject
of
literary
treatment
as
long
as
gaelic
was
written
at
all
the
earlier
cycle
perished
almost
completely
out
of
the
popular
remembrance
or
survived
only
in
distorted
forms
and
but
for
the
early
manuscripts
in
which
the
tales
are
fortunately
enshrined
such
a
work
as
the
tain
bo
cuailgné
greatest
thing
undoubtedly
which
the
celtic
genius
ever
produced
in
now
be
irrecoverably
lost
tales
of
deirdre
and
of
nothing
can
better
illustrate
the
difference
between
the
two
cycles
than
a
comparison
of
the
tale
of
deirdre
with
that
with
which
we
have
now
to
tale
of
dermot
and
grania
the
latter
from
one
point
of
view
reads
like
an
echo
of
the
former
so
close
is
the
resemblance
between
them
in
the
outline
of
the
plot
take
the
following
skeleton
story
a
fair
maiden
is
betrothed
to
a
renowned
and
mighty
suitor
much
older
than
herself
she
turns
from
him
to
seek
a
younger
lover
and
fixes
her
attention
on
one
of
his
followers
a
gallant
and
beautiful
youth
whom
she
persuades
in
spite
of
his
reluctance
to
fly
with
her
after
evading
pursuit
they
settle
down
for
a
while
at
a
distance
from
the
defrauded
lover
who
bides
his
time
till
at
last
under
cover
of
a
treacherous
reconciliation
he
procures
the
death
of
his
younger
rival
and
retakes
possession
of
the
were
a
student
of
celtic
legend
asked
to
listen
to
the
above
synopsis
and
to
say
to
what
irish
tale
it
referred
he
would
certainly
reply
that
it
must
be
either
the
tale
of
the
pursuit
of
dermot
and
grania
or
that
of
the
fate
of
the
sons
of
usna
but
which
of
them
it
was
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
tell
yet
in
tone
and
temper
the
two
stories
are
as
wide
apart
as
the
poles
and
grania
in
the
fian
story
is
the
daughter
of
cormac
mac
art
high
king
of
ireland
she
is
betrothed
to
finn
mac
cumhal
whom
we
are
to
regard
at
this
period
as
an
old
and
but
still
mighty
warrior
the
famous
captains
of
the
fianna
all
assemble
at
tara
for
the
wedding
feast
and
as
they
sit
at
meat
grania
surveys
them
and
asks
their
names
of
her
father
s
druid
dara
it
is
a
wonder
she
says
that
finn
did
not
ask
me
for
oisīn
rather
than
for
oisīn
would
not
dare
to
take
thee
says
dara
grania
after
going
through
all
the
company
asks
who
is
that
man
with
the
spot
on
his
brow
with
the
sweet
voice
with
curling
dusky
hair
and
ruddy
cheek
that
is
dermot
o
dyna
replies
the
druid
the
of
the
lightsome
countenance
in
all
the
world
the
best
lover
of
women
and
grania
now
prepares
a
sleepy
draught
which
she
places
in
a
and
passes
round
by
her
handmaid
to
the
king
to
finn
and
to
all
the
company
except
the
chiefs
of
the
fianna
when
the
draught
has
done
its
work
she
goes
to
oisīn
wilt
thou
receive
courtship
from
me
oisīn
she
asks
that
will
i
not
says
oisīn
nor
from
any
woman
that
is
betrothed
to
grania
who
knew
very
well
what
oisīn
s
answer
would
be
now
turns
to
her
real
mark
dermot
he
at
first
refuses
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
i
put
thee
under
bonds
o
dermot
that
thou
take
me
out
of
tara
evil
are
these
bonds
grania
says
dermot
and
wherefore
hast
thou
put
them
on
me
before
all
the
kings
sons
that
feast
at
this
table
grania
then
explains
that
she
has
loved
dermot
ever
since
she
saw
him
years
ago
from
her
sunny
bower
take
part
in
and
win
a
great
hurling
match
on
the
green
at
tara
dermot
still
very
reluctant
pleads
the
merits
of
finn
and
urges
also
that
finn
has
the
keys
of
the
royal
fortress
so
that
they
can
not
pass
out
at
night
there
is
a
secret
in
my
bower
says
grania
i
am
under
not
to
pass
through
any
replies
dermot
still
struggling
against
his
destiny
grania
will
have
none
of
these
fian
warrior
she
has
been
told
can
leap
over
a
palisade
with
the
aid
of
his
spear
as
a
and
she
goes
off
to
make
ready
for
the
elopement
dermot
in
great
perplexity
appeals
to
oisīn
oscar
keelta
and
the
others
as
to
what
he
should
do
they
all
bid
him
keep
his
bonds
that
grania
had
laid
on
him
to
succour
he
takes
leave
of
them
with
tears
outside
the
he
again
begs
grania
to
return
it
is
certain
that
i
will
not
go
back
says
grania
nor
part
from
thee
till
death
part
then
go
forward
o
grania
says
dermot
after
they
had
gone
a
mile
i
am
truly
weary
o
grandson
of
dyna
says
grania
it
is
a
good
time
to
be
weary
says
dermot
making
a
last
effort
to
rid
himself
of
the
entanglement
and
return
now
to
thy
household
again
for
i
pledge
the
word
of
a
true
warrior
that
i
will
never
carry
thee
nor
any
other
woman
to
all
there
is
no
need
replies
grania
and
she
directs
him
where
to
find
horses
and
a
chariot
and
dermot
now
finally
accepting
the
inevitable
yokes
them
and
they
proceed
on
their
way
to
the
ford
of
luan
on
the
shannon
next
day
finn
burning
with
rage
sets
out
with
his
warriors
on
their
track
he
traces
out
each
of
their
and
finds
the
hut
of
wattles
which
dermot
has
made
for
their
shelter
and
the
bed
of
soft
rushes
and
the
remains
of
the
meal
they
had
eaten
and
at
each
place
he
finds
a
piece
of
unbroken
bread
or
uncooked
s
subtle
message
to
finn
that
he
has
respected
the
rights
of
his
lord
and
treated
grania
as
a
sister
but
this
delicacy
of
dermot
s
is
not
at
all
to
crania
s
mind
and
she
conveys
her
wishes
to
him
in
a
manner
which
is
curiously
paralleled
by
an
episode
in
the
tale
of
tristan
and
iseult
of
brittany
as
told
by
heinrich
von
freiberg
they
are
passing
through
a
piece
of
wet
ground
when
a
splash
of
water
strikes
grania
she
turns
to
her
companion
thou
art
a
mighty
warrior
o
dermot
in
battle
and
sieges
and
forays
yet
meseems
that
this
drop
of
water
is
bolder
than
this
hint
that
he
was
keeping
at
too
respectful
a
distance
was
taken
by
dermot
the
die
is
now
cast
and
he
will
never
again
meet
finn
and
his
old
comrades
except
at
the
point
of
the
spear
the
tale
now
loses
much
of
the
originality
and
charm
of
its
opening
scene
and
recounts
in
a
somewhat
mechanical
manner
a
number
of
episodes
in
which
dermot
is
attacked
or
besieged
by
the
fianna
and
rescues
himself
and
his
lady
by
miracles
of
boldness
or
dexterity
or
by
aid
of
the
magical
devices
of
his
angus
ōg
they
are
chased
all
over
ireland
and
the
dolmens
in
that
country
are
popularly
associated
with
them
being
called
in
the
traditions
of
the
peasantry
beds
of
dermot
and
grania
s
character
is
drawn
throughout
with
great
consistency
she
is
not
an
heroic
are
not
the
simple
ardent
impulses
and
unwavering
devotion
of
a
deirdre
the
latter
is
far
more
primitive
grania
is
a
curiously
modern
and
what
would
be
called
neurotic
restless
passionate
but
full
of
feminine
fascination
and
finn
make
after
sixteen
years
of
outlawry
peace
is
at
last
made
for
dermot
by
the
mediation
or
angus
with
king
cormac
and
with
finn
dermot
receives
his
proper
patrimony
the
cantred
of
o
dyna
and
other
lands
far
away
in
the
west
and
cormac
gives
another
of
his
daughters
to
finn
peaceably
they
abode
a
long
time
with
each
other
and
it
was
said
that
no
man
then
living
was
richer
in
gold
and
silver
in
flocks
and
herds
than
dermot
o
dyna
nor
one
that
made
more
grania
bears
to
dermot
four
sons
and
a
daughter
but
grania
is
not
satisfied
until
the
two
best
men
that
are
in
erin
namely
cormac
son
of
art
and
finn
son
of
cumhal
have
been
entertained
in
her
house
and
how
do
we
know
she
adds
but
our
daughter
might
then
get
a
fitting
husband
dermot
agrees
with
some
misgiving
the
king
and
finn
accept
the
invitation
and
they
and
their
retinues
are
feasted
for
a
year
at
rath
grania
vengeance
of
then
one
night
towards
the
end
of
the
year
of
feasting
dermot
is
awakened
from
sleep
by
the
baying
of
a
hound
he
starts
up
so
that
grania
caught
him
and
threw
her
two
arms
about
him
and
asked
him
what
he
had
it
is
the
voice
of
a
hound
says
dermot
and
i
marvel
to
hear
it
in
the
save
and
protect
thee
says
grania
it
is
the
danaan
folk
that
are
at
work
on
thee
lay
thee
down
but
three
times
the
hound
s
voice
awakens
him
and
on
the
morrow
he
goes
forth
armed
with
sword
and
sling
and
followed
by
his
own
hound
to
see
what
is
afoot
on
the
mountain
of
ben
bulben
in
sligo
he
comes
across
finn
with
a
of
the
fianna
they
are
not
now
hunting
however
they
are
being
hunted
for
they
have
roused
up
the
enchanted
boar
without
ears
or
tail
the
boar
of
ben
bulben
which
has
slain
thirty
of
them
that
morning
and
do
thou
come
away
says
finn
knowing
well
that
dermot
will
never
retreat
from
a
danger
for
thou
art
under
not
to
hunt
how
is
that
says
dermot
and
finn
then
tells
him
the
weird
story
of
the
death
of
the
steward
s
son
and
his
revivification
in
the
form
of
this
boar
with
its
mission
of
vengeance
by
my
word
quoth
dermot
it
is
to
slay
me
that
thou
hast
made
this
hunt
o
finn
and
if
it
be
here
that
i
am
fated
to
die
i
have
no
power
now
to
shun
the
beast
then
appears
on
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
dermot
slips
the
hound
at
him
but
the
hound
flies
in
terror
dermot
then
slings
a
stone
which
strikes
the
boar
fairly
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
but
does
not
even
scratch
his
skin
the
beast
is
close
on
him
now
and
dermot
strikes
him
with
his
sword
but
the
weapon
flies
in
two
and
not
a
bristle
of
the
boar
is
cut
in
the
charge
of
the
boar
dermot
falls
over
him
and
is
carried
for
a
space
clinging
to
his
back
but
at
last
the
boar
shakes
him
off
to
the
ground
and
making
an
eager
exceeding
mighty
spring
upon
him
rips
out
his
bowels
while
at
the
same
time
with
the
hilt
of
the
sword
still
in
his
hand
dermot
dashes
out
the
brains
of
the
beast
and
it
falls
dead
beside
him
of
the
implacable
finn
then
comes
up
and
stands
over
dermot
in
his
agony
it
likes
me
well
to
see
thee
in
that
plight
o
dermot
he
says
and
i
would
that
all
the
women
in
ireland
saw
thee
now
for
thy
excellent
beauty
is
turned
to
ugliness
and
thy
choice
form
to
dermot
reminds
finn
of
how
he
once
rescued
him
from
deadly
peril
when
attacked
during
a
feast
at
the
house
of
derc
and
begs
him
to
heal
him
with
a
draught
of
water
from
his
hands
for
finn
had
the
magic
gift
of
restoring
any
wounded
man
to
health
with
a
draught
of
drawn
in
his
two
hands
here
is
no
well
says
finn
that
is
not
true
says
dermot
for
nine
paces
from
you
is
the
best
well
of
pure
water
in
the
finn
at
last
on
the
entreaty
of
oscar
and
the
fianna
and
after
the
recital
of
many
deeds
done
for
his
sake
by
dermot
in
old
days
goes
to
the
well
but
ere
he
brings
the
water
to
dermot
s
side
he
lets
it
fall
through
his
fingers
a
second
time
he
goes
and
a
second
time
he
lets
the
water
fall
having
thought
upon
grania
and
dermot
gave
a
sigh
of
anguish
on
seeing
it
oscar
then
declares
that
if
finn
does
not
bring
the
water
promptly
either
he
or
finn
shall
never
leave
the
hill
alive
and
finn
goes
once
more
to
the
well
but
it
is
now
too
late
dermot
is
dead
before
the
healing
draught
can
reach
his
lips
then
finn
takes
the
hound
of
dermot
the
chiefs
of
the
fianna
lay
their
cloaks
over
the
dead
man
and
they
return
to
rath
grania
grania
seeing
the
hound
led
by
finn
conjectures
what
has
happened
and
swoons
upon
the
rampart
of
the
rath
oisīn
when
she
has
revived
gives
her
the
hound
against
finn
s
will
and
the
fianna
troop
away
leaving
her
to
her
sorrow
when
the
people
of
grania
s
household
go
out
to
fetch
in
the
body
of
dermot
they
find
there
angus
ōg
and
his
company
of
the
people
of
dana
who
after
raising
three
bitter
and
terrible
cries
bear
away
the
body
on
a
gilded
bier
and
angus
declares
that
though
he
can
not
restore
the
dead
to
life
i
will
send
a
soul
into
him
so
that
he
may
talk
with
me
each
end
of
to
a
tale
like
this
modern
taste
demands
a
romantic
and
sentimental
ending
and
such
has
actually
been
given
to
it
in
the
retelling
by
joyce
in
his
old
celtic
romances
as
it
has
to
the
tale
of
deirdre
by
almost
every
modern
writer
who
has
handled
it
but
the
celtic
felt
differently
the
tale
of
the
end
of
deirdre
is
horribly
cruel
that
of
grania
cynical
and
mocking
neither
is
in
the
least
sentimental
grania
is
at
first
enraged
with
finn
and
sends
her
sons
abroad
to
learn
feats
of
arms
so
that
they
may
take
vengeance
upon
him
when
the
time
is
ripe
but
finn
wily
and
as
he
is
portrayed
in
this
tale
knows
how
to
forestall
this
danger
when
the
tragedy
on
ben
bulben
has
begun
to
grow
a
little
faint
in
the
shallow
soul
of
grania
he
betakes
himself
to
her
and
though
met
at
first
with
scorn
and
indignation
he
woos
her
so
sweetly
and
with
such
tenderness
that
at
last
he
brings
her
to
his
will
and
he
bears
her
back
as
a
bride
to
the
hill
of
allen
when
the
fianna
see
the
pair
coming
towards
them
in
this
loving
guise
they
burst
into
a
shout
of
laughter
and
derision
so
that
grania
bowed
her
head
in
we
trow
o
finn
cries
oisīn
that
thou
wilt
keep
grania
well
from
so
grania
made
peace
between
finn
and
her
sons
and
dwelt
with
finn
as
his
wife
until
he
died
streams
of
fian
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
this
legend
finn
does
not
appear
as
a
sympathetic
character
our
interest
is
all
on
the
side
of
dermot
in
this
aspect
of
it
the
tale
is
typical
of
a
certain
class
of
fian
stories
just
as
there
were
two
rival
clans
within
the
fian
clan
bascna
and
the
clan
sometimes
came
to
blows
for
the
supremacy
so
there
are
two
streams
of
legends
seeming
to
flow
respectively
from
one
or
other
of
these
sources
in
one
of
which
finn
is
glorified
while
in
the
other
he
is
belittled
in
favour
of
goll
mac
morna
or
any
other
hero
with
whom
he
comes
into
conflict
of
the
the
story
of
the
end
of
the
fianna
is
told
in
a
number
of
pieces
some
prose
some
poetry
all
of
them
however
agreeing
in
presenting
this
event
as
a
piece
of
sober
history
without
any
of
the
supernatural
and
mystical
atmosphere
in
which
nearly
all
the
fian
legends
are
steeped
after
the
death
of
cormac
mac
art
his
son
cairbry
came
to
the
of
ireland
he
had
a
fair
daughter
named
light
of
beauty
who
was
asked
in
marriage
by
a
son
of
the
king
of
the
decies
the
marriage
was
arranged
and
the
fianna
claimed
a
ransom
or
tribute
of
twenty
ingots
of
gold
which
it
is
said
was
customarily
paid
to
them
on
these
occasions
it
would
seem
that
the
fianna
had
now
grown
to
be
a
distinct
power
within
the
state
and
an
oppressive
one
exacting
heavy
tributes
and
burdensome
privileges
from
kings
and
all
over
ireland
cairbry
resolved
to
break
them
and
he
thought
he
had
now
a
good
opportunity
to
do
so
he
therefore
refused
payment
of
the
ransom
and
summoned
all
the
provincial
kings
to
help
him
against
the
fianna
the
main
body
of
whom
immediately
went
into
rebellion
for
what
they
deemed
their
rights
the
old
feud
between
clan
bascna
and
clan
morna
now
broke
out
afresh
the
latter
standing
by
the
high
king
while
clan
bascna
aided
by
the
king
of
munster
and
his
forces
who
alone
took
their
side
marched
against
cairbry
battle
of
all
this
sounds
very
and
probable
but
how
much
real
history
there
may
be
in
it
it
is
very
hard
to
say
the
decisive
battle
of
the
war
which
ensued
took
place
at
gowra
gabhra
the
name
of
which
survives
in
garristown
dublin
the
rival
forces
when
drawn
up
in
battle
array
knelt
and
kissed
the
sacred
soil
of
erin
before
they
charged
the
story
of
the
battle
in
the
poetical
versions
one
of
which
is
published
in
the
ossianic
society
s
transactions
and
another
and
finer
one
in
campbell
s
the
fians
is
supposed
to
be
related
by
oisīn
to
patrick
he
lays
great
stress
on
the
feats
of
his
son
oscar
my
son
urged
his
course
through
the
battalions
of
tara
like
a
hawk
through
a
flock
of
birds
or
a
rock
descending
a
death
of
the
fight
was
and
the
slaughter
on
both
sides
tremendous
none
but
old
men
and
boys
it
is
said
were
left
in
erin
after
that
fight
the
fianna
were
in
the
end
almost
entirely
exterminated
and
oscar
slain
he
and
the
king
of
ireland
cairbry
met
in
single
combat
and
each
of
them
slew
the
other
while
oscar
was
still
breathing
though
there
was
not
a
palm
s
breadth
on
his
body
without
a
wound
his
father
found
him
i
found
my
own
son
lying
down
on
his
left
elbow
his
shield
by
his
side
his
right
hand
clutched
the
sword
the
blood
poured
through
his
mail
oscar
gazed
up
at
woe
to
me
was
that
sight
he
stretched
out
his
two
arms
to
me
endeavouring
to
rise
to
meet
me
i
grasped
the
hand
of
my
son
and
sat
down
by
his
left
side
and
since
i
sat
by
him
there
i
have
recked
nought
of
the
when
finn
in
the
scottish
version
comes
to
bewail
his
grandson
he
cries
woe
that
it
was
not
i
who
fell
in
the
fight
of
bare
sunny
gavra
and
you
were
east
and
west
marching
before
the
fians
but
oscar
replies
were
it
you
that
fell
in
the
fight
of
bare
sunny
gavra
one
sigh
east
or
west
would
not
be
heard
for
you
from
oscar
no
man
ever
knew
a
heart
of
flesh
was
in
my
breast
but
a
heart
of
the
twisted
horn
and
a
sheath
of
steel
over
it
but
the
howling
of
dogs
beside
me
and
the
wail
of
the
old
heroes
and
the
weeping
of
the
women
by
turns
tis
that
vexes
my
oscar
dies
after
thanking
the
gods
for
his
father
s
safety
and
oisīn
and
keelta
raise
him
on
a
bier
of
spears
and
carry
him
off
under
his
banner
the
terrible
sheaf
for
burial
on
the
field
where
he
died
and
where
a
great
green
burial
mound
is
still
associated
with
his
name
finn
takes
no
part
in
the
battle
he
is
said
to
have
come
in
a
ship
to
view
the
field
afterwards
and
he
wept
over
oscar
a
thing
he
had
never
done
save
once
before
for
his
hound
bran
whom
he
himself
killed
by
accident
possibly
the
reference
to
the
ship
is
an
indication
that
he
had
by
this
time
passed
away
and
came
to
revisit
the
earth
from
the
oversea
kingdom
of
death
there
is
in
this
tale
of
the
battle
of
gowra
a
melancholy
grandeur
which
gives
it
a
place
apart
in
the
ossianic
literature
it
is
a
fitting
dirge
for
a
great
legendary
epoch
campbell
tells
us
that
the
scottish
crofters
and
shepherds
were
wont
to
put
off
their
bonnets
when
they
recited
it
he
adds
a
strange
and
thrilling
piece
of
modern
bearing
on
it
two
men
it
is
said
were
out
at
night
probably
or
on
some
other
predatory
occupation
and
telling
fian
tales
as
they
went
when
they
observed
two
giant
and
shadowy
figures
talking
to
each
other
across
the
glen
one
of
the
apparitions
said
to
the
other
do
you
see
that
man
down
below
i
was
the
second
of
battle
on
the
day
of
gowra
and
that
man
there
knows
all
about
it
better
than
end
of
as
to
finn
himself
it
is
strange
that
in
all
the
extant
mass
of
the
ossianic
literature
there
should
be
no
complete
narrative
of
his
death
there
are
references
to
it
in
the
poetic
legends
and
annalists
even
date
it
but
the
references
conflict
with
each
other
and
so
do
the
dates
there
is
no
clear
light
to
be
obtained
on
the
subject
from
either
annalists
or
poets
finn
seems
to
have
melted
into
the
magic
mist
which
enwraps
so
many
of
his
deeds
in
life
yet
a
popular
tradition
says
that
he
and
his
great
companions
oscar
and
keelta
and
oisīn
and
the
rest
never
died
but
lie
like
kaiser
barbarossa
in
an
enchanted
cave
where
they
await
the
appointed
time
to
reappear
in
glory
and
redeem
their
land
from
tyranny
and
wrong
chapter
vii
the
voyage
of
maeldūn
besides
the
legends
which
cluster
round
great
heroic
names
and
have
or
at
least
pretend
to
have
the
character
of
history
there
are
many
others
great
and
small
which
tell
of
adventures
lying
purely
in
regions
of
romance
and
out
of
earthly
space
and
time
as
a
specimen
of
these
i
give
here
a
summary
of
the
voyage
of
maeldūn
a
most
curious
and
brilliant
piece
of
invention
which
is
found
in
the
manuscript
entitled
the
book
of
the
dun
cow
about
and
other
early
sources
and
edited
with
a
translation
to
which
i
owe
the
following
extracts
by
whitley
stokes
in
the
revue
celtique
for
and
it
is
only
one
of
a
number
of
such
found
in
ancient
irish
literature
but
it
is
believed
to
have
been
the
earliest
of
them
all
and
model
for
the
rest
and
it
has
had
the
distinction
in
the
abridged
and
modified
form
given
by
joyce
in
his
old
celtic
romances
of
having
furnished
the
theme
for
the
voyage
of
maeldune
to
tennyson
who
made
it
into
a
wonderful
creation
of
rhythm
and
colour
embodying
a
kind
of
allegory
of
irish
history
it
will
be
noticed
at
the
end
that
we
are
in
the
unusual
position
of
knowing
the
name
of
the
author
of
this
piece
of
primitive
literature
though
he
does
not
claim
to
have
composed
but
only
to
have
put
in
order
the
incidents
of
the
unfortunately
we
can
not
tell
when
he
lived
but
the
tale
as
we
have
it
probably
dates
from
the
ninth
century
its
atmosphere
is
entirely
christian
and
it
has
no
mythological
significance
except
in
so
far
as
it
teaches
the
lesson
that
the
oracular
injunctions
of
wizards
should
be
obeyed
no
adventure
or
even
detail
of
importance
is
omitted
in
the
following
summary
of
the
story
which
is
given
thus
fully
because
the
reader
may
take
it
as
representing
a
large
and
important
section
of
irish
legendary
romance
apart
from
the
source
to
which
i
am
indebted
the
revue
celtique
i
know
no
other
faithful
reproduction
in
english
of
this
wonderful
tale
the
voyage
of
maeldūn
begins
as
irish
tales
often
do
by
telling
us
of
the
conception
of
its
hero
there
was
a
famous
man
of
the
sept
of
the
owens
of
aran
named
ailill
who
went
with
his
king
on
a
foray
into
another
territory
they
encamped
one
night
near
a
church
and
convent
of
nuns
at
midnight
ailill
who
was
near
the
church
saw
a
certain
nun
come
out
to
strike
the
bell
for
nocturns
and
caught
her
by
the
hand
in
ancient
ireland
religious
persons
were
not
much
respected
in
time
of
war
and
ailill
did
not
respect
her
when
they
parted
she
said
to
him
whence
is
thy
race
and
what
is
thy
name
said
the
hero
ailill
of
the
is
my
name
and
i
am
of
the
owenacht
of
aran
in
not
long
afterwards
ailill
was
slain
by
reavers
from
leix
who
burned
the
church
of
doocloone
over
his
head
in
due
time
a
son
was
born
to
the
woman
and
she
called
his
name
maeldūn
he
was
taken
secretly
to
her
friend
the
queen
of
the
territory
and
by
her
maeldūn
was
reared
beautiful
indeed
was
his
form
and
it
is
doubtful
if
there
hath
been
in
flesh
any
one
so
beautiful
as
he
so
he
grew
up
till
he
was
a
young
warrior
and
fit
to
use
weapons
great
then
was
his
brightness
and
his
gaiety
and
his
playfulness
in
his
play
he
outwent
all
his
comrades
in
throwing
balls
and
in
running
and
leaping
and
putting
stones
and
racing
one
day
a
proud
young
warrior
who
had
been
defeated
by
him
taunted
him
with
his
lack
of
knowledge
of
his
kindred
and
descent
maeldūn
went
to
his
the
queen
and
said
i
will
not
eat
nor
drink
till
thou
tell
me
who
are
my
mother
and
my
i
am
thy
mother
said
the
queen
for
none
ever
loved
her
son
more
than
i
love
but
maeldūn
insisted
on
knowing
all
and
the
queen
at
last
took
him
to
his
own
mother
the
nun
who
told
him
thy
father
was
ailill
of
the
owens
of
then
maeldūn
went
to
his
own
kindred
and
was
well
received
by
them
and
with
him
he
took
as
guests
his
three
beloved
sons
of
the
king
and
queen
who
had
brought
him
up
after
a
time
maeldūn
happened
to
be
among
a
company
of
young
warriors
who
were
contending
at
putting
the
stone
in
the
graveyard
of
the
ruined
church
of
doocloone
maeldūn
s
foot
was
planted
as
he
heaved
the
stone
on
a
scorched
and
blackened
flagstone
and
one
who
was
by
a
monk
named
briccne
said
to
him
it
were
better
for
thee
to
avenge
the
man
who
was
burnt
there
than
to
cast
stones
over
his
burnt
who
was
that
asked
maeldūn
ailill
thy
father
they
told
him
who
slew
him
said
he
reavers
from
leix
they
said
and
they
destroyed
him
on
this
then
maeldūn
threw
down
the
stone
he
was
about
to
cast
and
put
his
mantle
round
him
and
went
home
and
he
asked
the
way
to
leix
they
told
him
he
could
only
go
there
by
sea
at
the
advice
of
a
druid
he
then
built
him
a
boat
or
coracle
of
skins
lapped
threefold
one
over
the
other
and
the
wizard
also
told
him
that
seventeen
men
only
must
accompany
him
and
on
what
day
he
must
begin
the
boat
and
on
what
day
he
must
put
out
to
sea
so
when
his
company
was
ready
he
put
out
and
hoisted
the
sail
but
had
gone
only
a
little
way
when
his
three
came
down
to
the
beach
and
entreated
him
to
take
them
get
you
home
said
maeldūn
for
none
but
the
number
i
have
may
go
with
but
the
three
youths
would
not
be
separated
from
maeldūn
and
they
flung
themselves
into
the
sea
he
turned
back
lest
they
should
be
drowned
and
brought
them
into
his
boat
all
as
we
shall
see
were
punished
for
this
transgression
and
maeldūn
condemned
to
wandering
until
expiation
had
been
made
irish
bardic
tales
excel
in
their
openings
in
this
case
as
usual
the
is
admirably
contrived
the
narrative
which
follows
tells
how
after
seeing
his
father
s
slayer
on
an
island
but
being
unable
to
land
there
maeldūn
and
his
party
are
blown
out
to
sea
where
they
visit
a
great
number
of
islands
and
have
many
strange
adventures
on
them
the
tale
becomes
in
fact
a
of
stories
and
incidents
some
not
very
interesting
while
in
others
as
in
the
adventure
of
the
island
of

the
island

or
that
where
the

takes
place

sense
of
beauty
romance
and
mystery
find
an
expression
unsurpassed
perhaps
in
literature
in
the
following
rendering
i
have
omitted
the
verses
given
by
joyce
at
the
end
of

merely
recapitulate
the

not
found

of
the
maeldūn
and
his
crew
had
rowed
all
day
and
half
the
night
when
they
came
to
two
small
bare
islands
with
two
forts
in
them
and
a
noise
was
heard
from
them

the
rhymer
cried
that
god
had
guided
them
to
the
spot
where
they
would
be
but
a
great
wind
arose
suddenly
and
blew
them
off
into
the
boundless
ocean
and
maeldūn
said
to
his
ye
have
caused
this
to
be
casting
yourselves
on
board
in
spite
of
the
words
of
the
and
they
had
no
answer
save
only
to
be
silent
for
a
little
space
island
of
the
they
drifted
three
days
and
three
nights
not
knowing
whither
to
row
when
at
the
dawn
of
the
third
day
they
heard
the
noise
of
breakers
and
came
to
an
island
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
up
here
ere
they
could
land
they
met
a
swarm
of
ferocious
ants
each
the
size
of
a
foal
that
came
down
the
strand
and
into
the
sea
to
get
at
them
so
they
made
off
quickly
and
saw
no
land
for
three
days
more
island
of
the
great
this
was
a
terraced
island
with
trees
all
round
it
and
great
birds
sitting
on
the
trees
maeldūn
landed
first
alone
and
carefully
searched
the
island
for
any
evil
thing
but
finding
none
the
rest
followed
him
and
killed
and
ate
many
of
the
birds
bringing
others
on
board
their
boat
island
of
the
fierce
a
great
sandy
island
was
this
and
on
it
a
beast
like
a
horse
but
with
clawed
feet
like
a
hound
s
he
flew
at
them
to
devour
them
but
they
put
off
in
time
and
were
pelted
by
the
beast
with
pebbles
from
the
shore
as
they
rowed
away
island
of
the
giant
a
great
flat
island
which
it
fell
by
lot
to
germān
and
diuran
to
explore
first
they
found
a
vast
green
racecourse
on
which
were
the
marks
of
horses
hoofs
each
as
big
as
the
sail
of
a
ship
and
the
shells
of
nuts
of
monstrous
size
were
lying
about
and
much
plunder
so
they
were
afraid
and
took
ship
hastily
again
and
from
the
sea
they
saw
a
in
progress
and
heard
the
shouting
of
a
great
multitude
cheering
on
the
white
horse
or
the
brown
and
saw
the
giant
horses
running
swifter
than
the
wind
so
they
rowed
away
with
all
their
might
thinking
they
had
come
upon
an
assembly
of
demons
island
of
the
stone
a
full
week
passed
and
then
they
found
a
great
high
island
with
a
house
standing
on
the
shore
a
door
with
a
valve
of
stone
opened
into
the
sea
and
through
it
the
kept
hurling
salmon
into
the
house
maeldūn
and
his
party
entered
and
found
the
house
empty
of
folk
but
a
great
bed
lay
ready
for
the
chief
to
whom
it
belonged
and
a
bed
for
each
three
of
his
company
and
meat
and
drink
beside
each
bed
maeldūn
and
his
party
ate
and
drank
their
fill
and
then
sailed
off
again
island
of
the
by
the
time
they
had
come
here
they
had
been
a
long
time
voyaging
and
food
had
failed
them
and
they
were
hungry
this
island
had
precipitous
sides
from
which
a
wood
hung
down
and
as
they
passed
along
the
cliffs
maeldūn
broke
off
a
twig
and
held
it
in
his
hand
three
days
and
nights
they
coasted
the
cliff
and
found
no
entrance
to
the
island
but
by
that
time
a
cluster
of
three
apples
had
grown
on
the
end
of
maeldūn
s
rod
and
each
apple
sufficed
the
crew
for
forty
days
island
of
the
wondrous
this
island
had
a
fence
of
stone
round
it
and
within
the
fence
a
huge
beast
that
raced
round
and
round
the
island
and
anon
it
went
to
the
top
of
the
island
and
then
performed
a
marvellous
feat
it
turned
its
body
round
and
round
inside
its
skin
the
skin
remaining
unmoved
while
again
it
would
revolve
its
skin
round
and
round
the
body
when
it
saw
the
party
it
rushed
at
them
but
they
escaped
pelted
with
stones
as
they
rowed
away
one
of
the
stones
pierced
through
maeldūn
s
shield
and
lodged
in
the
keel
of
the
boat
island
of
the
biting
here
were
many
great
beasts
resembling
horses
that
tore
continually
pieces
of
flesh
from
each
other
s
sides
so
that
all
the
island
ran
with
blood
they
rowed
hastily
away
and
were
now
disheartened
and
full
of
complaints
for
they
knew
not
where
they
were
nor
how
to
find
guidance
or
aid
in
their
quest
island
of
the
fiery
with
great
weariness
hunger
and
thirst
they
arrived
at
the
tenth
island
which
was
full
of
trees
loaded
with
golden
apples
under
the
trees
went
red
beasts
like
fiery
swine
that
kicked
the
trees
with
their
legs
when
the
apples
fell
and
the
beasts
consumed
them
the
beasts
came
out
at
morning
only
when
a
multitude
of
birds
left
the
island
and
swam
out
to
sea
till
nones
when
they
turned
and
swam
inward
again
till
vespers
and
ate
the
apples
all
night
maeldūn
and
his
comrades
landed
at
night
and
felt
the
soil
hot
under
their
feet
from
the
fiery
swine
in
their
caverns
underground
they
collected
all
the
apples
they
could
which
were
good
both
against
hunger
and
thirst
and
loaded
their
boat
with
them
and
put
to
sea
once
more
refreshed
island
of
the
little
the
apples
had
failed
them
when
they
came
hungry
and
thirsting
to
the
eleventh
island
this
was
as
it
were
a
tall
white
tower
of
chalk
reaching
up
to
the
clouds
and
on
the
rampart
about
it
were
great
houses
white
as
snow
they
entered
the
largest
of
them
and
found
no
man
in
it
but
a
small
cat
playing
on
four
stone
pillars
which
were
in
the
midst
of
the
house
leaping
from
one
to
the
other
it
looked
a
little
on
the
irish
warriors
but
did
not
cease
from
its
play
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
there
were
three
rows
of
objects
hanging
up
one
row
of
brooches
of
gold
and
silver
and
one
of
of
gold
and
silver
each
as
big
as
the
hoop
of
a
cask
and
one
of
great
swords
with
gold
and
silver
hilts
quilts
and
shining
garments
lay
in
the
room
and
there
also
were
a
roasted
ox
and
a
flitch
of
bacon
and
abundance
of
liquor
hath
this
been
left
for
us
said
maeldūn
to
the
cat
it
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
continued
its
play
so
there
they
ate
and
drank
and
slept
and
stored
up
what
remained
of
the
food
next
day
as
they
made
to
leave
the
house
the
youngest
of
maeldūn
s
took
a
necklace
from
the
wall
and
was
bearing
it
out
when
the
cat
suddenly
leaped
through
him
like
a
fiery
arrow
and
he
fell
a
heap
of
ashes
on
the
floor
thereupon
maeldūn
who
had
forbidden
the
theft
of
the
jewel
soothed
the
cat
and
replaced
the
necklace
and
they
strewed
the
ashes
of
the
dead
youth
on
the
and
put
to
sea
again
island
of
the
black
and
the
white
this
had
a
brazen
palisade
dividing
it
in
two
and
a
flock
of
black
sheep
on
one
side
and
of
white
sheep
on
the
other
between
them
was
a
big
man
who
tended
the
flocks
and
sometimes
he
put
a
white
sheep
among
the
black
when
it
became
black
at
once
or
a
black
sheep
among
the
white
when
it
immediately
turned
white
by
way
of
an
experiment
maeldūn
flung
a
peeled
white
wand
on
the
side
of
the
black
sheep
it
at
once
turned
black
whereat
they
left
the
place
in
terror
and
without
landing
island
of
the
giant
a
great
and
wide
island
with
a
herd
of
huge
swine
on
it
they
killed
a
small
pig
and
roasted
it
on
the
spot
as
it
was
too
great
to
carry
on
board
the
island
rose
up
into
a
very
high
mountain
and
diuran
and
germān
went
to
view
the
country
from
the
top
of
it
on
their
way
they
met
a
broad
river
to
try
the
depth
of
the
water
germān
dipped
in
the
haft
of
his
spear
which
at
once
was
consumed
as
with
liquid
fire
on
the
other
bank
was
a
huge
man
guarding
what
seemed
a
herd
of
oxen
he
called
to
them
not
to
disturb
the
calves
so
they
went
no
further
and
speedily
sailed
away
island
of
the
here
they
found
a
great
and
mill
and
a
giant
miller
grinding
corn
in
it
half
the
corn
of
your
country
he
said
is
ground
here
here
comes
to
be
ground
all
that
men
begrudge
to
each
heavy
and
many
were
the
loads
they
saw
going
to
it
and
all
that
was
ground
in
it
was
carried
away
westwards
so
they
crossed
themselves
and
sailed
away
island
of
the
black
an
island
full
of
black
people
continually
weeping
and
lamenting
one
of
the
two
remaining
landed
on
it
and
immediately
turned
black
and
fell
to
weeping
like
the
rest
two
others
went
to
fetch
him
the
same
fate
befell
them
four
others
then
went
with
their
heads
wrapped
in
cloths
that
they
should
not
look
on
the
land
or
breathe
the
air
of
the
place
and
they
seized
two
of
the
lost
ones
and
brought
them
away
perforce
but
not
the
the
two
rescued
ones
could
not
explain
their
conduct
except
by
saying
that
they
had
to
do
as
they
saw
others
doing
about
them

gave
them
food
like

that
tasted
to
each
man
as
he
wished
it
to
be
and
an
intoxicating
liquor
that
put
them
asleep
for
three
days
when
they
awoke
they
were
at
sea
in
their
boat
and
of
the
island
and
its
inhabitants
nothing
was
to
be
seen
the
island
of
the
glass
bridge
here
we
come
to
one
of
the
most
elaborately
wrought
and
picturesque
of
all
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
the
island
they
now
reached
had
on
it
a
fortress
with
a
brazen
door
and
a
bridge
of
glass
leading
to
it
when
they
sought
to
cross
the
bridge
it
threw
them
backward
a
woman
came
out
of
the
fortress
with
a
pail
in
her
hand
and
lifting
from
the
bridge
a
slab
of
glass
she
let
down
her
pail
into
the
water
beneath
and
returned
to
the
fortress
they
struck
on
the
brazen
portcullis
before
them
to
gain
admittance
but
the
melody
given
forth
by
the
smitten
metal
plunged
them
in
slumber
till
the
morrow
morn
thrice
over
this
happened
the
woman
each
time
making
an
ironical
speech
about
maeldūn
on
the
fourth
day
however
she
came
out
to
them
over
the
bridge
wearing
a
white
mantle
with
a
circlet
of
gold
on
her
hair
two
silver
sandals
on
her
rosy
feet
and
a
filmy
silken
smock
next
her
skin
my
welcome
to
thee
o
maeldūn
she
said
and
she
welcomed
each
man
of
the
crew
by
his
own
name
then
she
took
them
into
the
great
house
and
allotted
a
couch
to
the
chief
and
one
for
each
three
of
his
men
she
gave
them
abundance
of
food
and
drink
all
out
of
her
one
pail
each
man
finding
in
it
what
he
most
desired
when
she
had
departed
they
asked
maeldūn
if
they
should
woo
the
maiden
for
him
how
would
it
hurt
you
to
speak
with
her
says
maeldūn
they
do
so
and
she
replies
i
know
not
nor
have
ever
known
what
sin
twice
over
this
is
repeated
she
says
at
last
you
shall
have
your
when
the
morning
breaks
however
they
find
themselves
once
more
at
sea
with
no
sign
of
the
island
or
fortress
or
lady
island
of
the
shouting
they
hear
from
afar
a
great
cry
and
chanting
as
it
were
a
singing
of
psalms
and
rowing
for
a
day
and
night
they
come
at
last
to
an
island
full
of
birds
black
brown
and
speckled
all
shouting
and
speaking
they
sail
away
without
landing
island
of
the
here
they
found
a
wooded
island
full
of
birds
and
on
it
a
solitary
man
whose
only
clothing
was
his
hair
they
asked
him
of
his
country
and
kin
he
tells
them
that
he
was
a
man
of
ireland
who
had
put
to
sea
with
a
sod
of
his
native
country
under
his
feet
god
had
turned
the
sod
into
an
island
adding
a
foot
s
breadth
to
it
and
one
tree
for
every
year
the
birds
are
his
kith
and
kin
and
they
all
wait
there
till
doomsday
miraculously
nourished
by
angels
he
entertained
them
for
three
nights
and
then
they
sailed
away
island
of
the
miraculous
this
island
had
a
golden
rampart
and
a
soft
white
soil
like
down
in
it
they
found
another
anchorite
clothed
only
in
his
hair
there
was
a
fountain
in
it
which
yields
whey
or
water
on
fridays
and
wednesdays
milk
on
sundays
and
feasts
of

island
of
the
as
they
approached
this
they
heard
from
afar
as
it
were
the
clanging
of
a
tremendous
smithy
and
heard
men
talking
of
themselves
little
boys
they
seem
said
one
in
a
little
trough
they
rowed
hastily
away
but
did
not
turn
their
boat
so
as
not
to
seem
to
be
flying
but
after
a
while
a
giant
smith
came
out
of
the
forge
holding
in
his
tongs
a
huge
mass
of
glowing
iron
which
he
cast
after
them
and
all
the
sea
boiled
round
it
as
it
fell
astern
of
their
boat
sea
of
clear
after
that
they
voyaged
until
they
entered
a
sea
that
resembled
green
glass
such
was
its
purity
that
the
gravel
and
the
sand
of
the
sea
were
clearly
visible
through
it
and
they
saw
no
monsters
or
beasts
therein
among
the
crags
but
only
the
pure
gravel
and
the
green
sand
for
a
long
space
of
the
day
they
were
voyaging
in
that
sea
and
great
was
its
splendour
and
its
beauty
undersea
they
next
found
themselves
in
a
sea
thin
like
mist
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
not
support
their
boat
in
the
depths
they
saw
roofed
fortresses
and
a
fair
land
around
them
a
monstrous
beast
lodged
in
a
tree
there
with
droves
of
cattle
about
it
and
beneath
it
an
armed
warrior
in
spite
of
the
warrior
the
beast
ever
and
anon
stretched
down
a
long
neck
and
seized
one
of
the
cattle
and
devoured
it
much
dreading
lest
they
should
sink
through
that
sea
they
sailed
over
it
and
away
island
of
the
when
they
arrived
here
they
found
the
water
rising
in
high
cliffs
round
the
island
and
looking
down
saw
on
it
a
crowd
of
people
who
screamed
at
them
it
is
they
it
is
they
till
they
were
out
of
breath
then
came
a
woman
and
pelted
them
from
below
with
large
nuts
which
they
gathered
and
took
with
them
as
they
went
they
heard
the
folk
crying
to
each
other
where
are
they
now
they
are
gone
they
are
it
is
likely
says
the
tale
that
there
was
some
one
concerning
whom
the
islanders
had
a
prophecy
that
he
would
ruin
their
country
and
expel
them
from
their
island
of
the
spouting
here
a
great
stream
spouted
out
of
one
side
of
the
island
and
arched
over
it
like
a
rainbow
falling
on
the
strand
at
the
further
side
and
when
they
thrust
their
spears
into
the
stream
above
them
they
brought
out
salmon
from
it
as
much
as
they
would
and
the
island
was
filled
with
the
stench
of
those
they
could
not
carry
away
island
of
the
silvern
the
next
wonder
to
which
they
came
forms
one
of
the
most
striking
and
imaginative
episodes
of
the
voyage
it
was
a
great
silvern
column
rising
from
the
sea
each
of
its
four
sides
was
as
wide
as
two
of
the
boat
not
a
sod
of
earth
was
at
its
foot
but
it
rose
from
the
boundless
ocean
and
its
summit
was
lost
in
the
sky
from
that
summit
a
huge
silver
net
was
flung
far
away
into
the
sea
and
through
a
mesh
of
that
net
they
sailed
as
they
did
so
diuran
hacked
away
a
piece
of
the
net
destroy
it
not
said
maeldūn
for
what
we
see
is
the
work
of
mighty
diuran
said
for
the
praise
of
god
s
name
i
do
this
that
our
tale
may
be
believed
and
if
i
reach
ireland
again
this
piece
of
silver
shall
be
offered
by
me
on
the
high
altar
of
two
ounces
and
a
half
it
weighed
when
it
was
measured
afterwards
in
armagh
and
then
they
heard
a
voice
from
the
summit
of
yonder
pillar
mighty
clear
and
distinct
but
they
knew
not
the
tongue
it
spake
or
the
words
it
island
of
the
the
next
island
stood
on
a
foot
or
pedestal
which
rose
from
the
sea
and
they
could
find
no
way
of
access
to
it
in
the
base
of
the
pedestal
was
a
door
closed
and
locked
which
they
could
not
open
so
they
sailed
away
having
seen
and
spoken
with
no
one
island
of
the
here
they
found
the
rampart
of
a
mighty
dūn
enclosing
a
mansion
they
landed
to
look
on
it
and
sat
on
a
hillock
near
by
within
the
dūn
they
saw
seventeen
maidens
busy
at
preparing
a
great
bath
in
a
little
while
a
rider
richly
clad
came
up
swiftly
on
a
racehorse
and
lighted
down
and
went
inside
one
of
the
girls
taking
the
horse
the
rider
then
went
into
the
bath
when
they
saw
that
it
was
a
woman
shortly
after
that
one
of
the
maidens
came
out
and
invited
them
to
enter
saying
the
queen
invites
they
went
into
the
fort
and
bathed
and
then
sat
down
to
meat
each
man
with
a
maiden
over
against
him
and
maeldūn
opposite
to
the
queen
and
maeldūn
was
wedded
to
the
queen
and
each
of
the
maidens
to
one
of
his
men
and
at
nightfall
canopied
chambers
were
allotted
to
each
of
them
on
the
morrow
morn
they
made
ready
to
depart
but
the
queen
would
not
have
them
go
and
said
stay
here
and
old
age
will
never
fall
on
you
but
ye
shall
remain
as
ye
are
now
for
ever
and
ever
and
what
ye
had
last
night
ye
shall
have
always
and
be
no
longer
from
island
to
island
on
the
she
then
told
maeldūn
that
she
was
the
mother
of
the
seventeen
girls
they
had
seen
and
her
husband
had
been
king
of
the
island
he
was
now
dead
and
she
reigned
in
his
place
each
day
she
went
into
the
great
plain
in
the
interior
of
the
island
to
judge
the
folk
and
returned
to
the
dūn
at
night
so
they
remained
there
for
three
months
of
winter
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
it
seemed
they
had
been
there
three
years
and
the
men
wearied
of
it
and
longed
to
set
forth
for
their
own
country
what
shall
we
find
there
said
maeldūn
that
is
better
than
this
but
still
the
people
murmured
and
complained
and
at
last
they
said
great
is
the
love
which
maeldūn
has
for
his
woman
let
him
stay
with
her
alone
if
he
will
but
we
will
go
to
our
own
but
maeldūn
would
not
be
left
after
them
and
at
last
one
day
when
the
queen
was
away
judging
the
folk
they
went
on
board
their
bark
and
put
out
to
sea
before
they
had
gone
far
however
the
queen
came
riding
up
with
a
clew
of
twine
in
her
hand
and
she
flung
it
after
them
maeldūn
caught
it
in
his
hand
and
it
clung
to
his
hand
so
that
he
could
not
free
himself
and
the
queen
holding
the
other
end
drew
them
back
to
land
and
they
stayed
on
the
island
another
three
months
twice
again
the
same
thing
happened
and
at
last
the
people
averred
that
maeldūn
held
the
clew
on
purpose
so
great
was
his
love
for
the
woman
so
the
next
time
another
man
caught
the
clew
but
it
clung
to
his
hand
as
before
so
diuran
smote
off
his
hand
and
it
fell
with
the
clew
into
the
sea
when
she
saw
that
she
at
once
began
to
wail
and
shriek
so
that
all
the
land
was
one
cry
wailing
and
and
thus
they
escaped
from
the
island
of
the
women
island
of
the
red
on
this
island
were
trees
with
great
red
berries
which
yielded
an
intoxicating
and
slumbrous
juice
they
mingled
it
with
water
to
moderate
its
power
and
filled
their
casks
with
it
and
sailed
away
island
of
the
a
large
island
with
woods
of
oak
and
yew
on
one
side
of
it
and
on
the
other
a
plain
whereon
were
herds
of
sheep
and
a
little
lake
in
it
and
there
also
they
found
a
small
church
and
a
fort
and
an
ancient
grey
cleric
clad
only
in
his
hair
maeldūn
asked
him
who
he
was
i
am
the
fifteenth
man
of
the
monks
of
brennan
of
birr
he
said
we
went
on
our
pilgrimage
into
the
ocean
and
they
have
all
died
save
me
he
showed
them
the
tablet
calendar
of
the
holy
brennan
and
they
prostrated
themselves
before
it
and
maeldūn
kissed
it
they
stayed
there
for
a
season
feeding
on
the
sheep
of
the
island
one
day
they
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
cloud
coming
up
from
the
as
it
drew
near
however
they
saw
the
waving
of
pinions
and
perceived
that
it
was
an
enormous
bird
it
came
into
the
island
and
alighting
very
wearily
on
a
hill
near
the
lake
it
began
eating
the
red
berries
like
grapes
which
grew
on
a
huge
as
big
as
a
oak
that
it
had
brought
with
it
and
the
juice
and
fragments
of
the
berries
fell
into
the
lake
reddening
all
the
water
fearful
that
it
would
seize
them
in
its
talons
and
bear
them
out
to
sea
they
lay
hid
in
the
woods
and
watched
it
after
a
while
however
maeldūn
went
out
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
but
the
bird
did
him
no
harm
and
then
the
rest
followed
cautiously
behind
their
shields
and
one
of
them
gathered
the
berries
off
the
branch
which
the
bird
held
in
its
talons
but
it
did
them
no
evil
and
regarded
them
not
at
all
and
they
saw
that
it
was
very
old
and
its
plumage
dull
and
decayed
at
the
hour
of
noon
two
eagles
came
up
from
the
and
alit
in
front
of
the
great
bird
and
after
resting
awhile
they
set
to
work
picking
off
the
insects
that
infested
its
jaws
and
eyes
and
ears
this
they
continued
till
vespers
when
all
three
ate
of
the
berries
again
at
last
on
the
following
day
when
the
great
bird
had
been
completely
cleansed
it
plunged
into
the
lake
and
again
the
two
eagles
picked
and
cleansed
it
till
the
third
day
the
great
bird
remained
preening
and
shaking
its
pinions
and
its
feathers
became
glossy
and
abundant
and
then
soaring
upwards
it
flew
thrice
round
the
island
and
away
to
the
quarter
whence
it
had
come
and
its
flight
was
now
swift
and
strong
whence
it
was
manifest
to
them
that
this
had
been
its
renewal
from
old
age
to
youth
according
as
the
prophet
said
youth
is
renewed
like
the
eagle
then
diuran
said
let
us
bathe
in
that
lake
and
renew
ourselves
where
the
bird
hath
been
nay
said
another
for
the
bird
hath
left
his
venom
in
but
diuran
plunged
in
and
drank
of
the
water
from
that
time
so
long
as
he
lived
his
eyes
were
strong
and
keen
and
not
a
tooth
fell
from
his
jaw
nor
a
hair
from
his
head
and
he
never
knew
illness
or
infirmity
thereafter
they
bade
farewell
to
the
anchorite
and
fared
forth
on
the
ocean
once
more
island
of
the
laughing
here
they
found
a
great
company
of
men
laughing
and
playing
incessantly
they
drew
lots
as
to
who
should
enter
and
explore
it
and
it
fell
to
maeldūn
s
but
when
he
set
foot
on
it
he
at
once
began
to
laugh
and
play
with
the
others
and
could
not
leave
off
nor
would
he
come
back
to
his
comrades
so
they
left
him
and
sailed
away
island
of
the
flaming
they
now
came
in
sight
of
an
island
which
was
not
large
and
it
had
about
it
a
rampart
of
flame
that
circled
round
and
round
it
continually
in
one
part
of
the
rampart
there
was
an
opening
and
when
this
opening
came
opposite
to
them
they
saw
through
it
the
whole
island
and
saw
those
who
dwelt
therein
even
men
and
women
beautiful
many
and
wearing
adorned
garments
with
vessels
of
gold
in
their
hands
and
the
festal
music
which
they
made
came
to
the
ears
of
the
wanderers
for
a
long
time
they
lingered
there
watching
this
marvel
and
they
deemed
it
delightful
to
island
of
the
monk
of
far
off
among
the
waves
they
saw
what
they
took
to
be
a
white
bird
on
the
water
drawing
near
to
it
they
found
it
to
be
an
aged
man
clad
only
in
the
white
hair
of
his
body
and
he
was
throwing
himself
in
prostrations
on
a
broad
rock
from
torach
i
have
come
hither
he
said
and
there
i
was
reared
i
was
cook
in
the
monastery
there
and
the
food
of
the
church
i
used
to
sell
for
myself
so
that
i
had
at
last
much
treasure
of
raiment
and
brazen
vessels
and
books
and
all
that
man
desires
great
was
my
pride
and
arrogance
one
day
as
i
dug
a
grave
in
which
to
bury
a
churl
who
had
been
brought
on
to
the
island
a
voice
came
from
below
where
a
holy
man
lay
buried
and
he
said
put
not
the
corpse
of
a
sinner
on
me
a
holy
pious
person
after
a
dispute
the
monk
buried
the
corpse
elsewhere
and
was
promised
an
eternal
reward
for
doing
so
not
long
thereafter
he
put
to
sea
in
a
boat
with
all
his
accumulated
treasures
meaning
apparently
to
escape
from
the
island
with
his
plunder
a
great
wind
blew
him
far
out
to
sea
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
of
land
the
boat
stood
still
in
one
place
he
saw
near
him
a
man
angel
sitting
on
the
wave
whither
goest
thou
said
the
man
on
a
pleasant
way
whither
i
am
now
looking
said
the
monk
it
would
not
be
pleasant
to
thee
if
thou
knewest
what
is
around
thee
said
the
man
so
far
as
eye
can
see
there
is
one
crowd
of
demons
all
gathered
around
thee
because
of
thy
covetousness
and
pride
and
theft
and
other
evil
deeds
thy
boat
hath
stopped
nor
will
it
move
until
thou
do
my
will
and
the
fires
of
hell
shall
get
hold
of
he
came
near
to
the
boat
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
fugitive
who
promised
to
do
his
will
fling
into
the
sea
he
said
all
the
wealth
that
is
in
thy
it
is
a
pity
said
the
monk
that
it
should
go
to
it
shall
in
nowise
go
to
loss
there
will
be
one
man
whom
thou
wilt
the
monk
thereupon
flung
everything
into
the
sea
save
one
little
wooden
cup
and
he
cast
away
oars
and
rudder
the
man
gave
him
a
provision
of
whey
and
seven
cakes
and
bade
him
abide
wherever
his
boat
should
stop
the
wind
and
waves
carried
him
hither
and
thither
till
at
last
the
boat
came
to
rest
upon
the
rock
where
the
wanderers
found
him
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
bare
rock
but
remembering
what
he
was
bidden
he
stepped
out
upon
a
little
ledge
over
which
the
waves
washed
and
the
boat
immediately
left
him
and
the
rock
was
enlarged
for
him
there
he
remained
seven
years
nourished
by
otters
which
brought
him
salmon
out
of
the
sea
and
even
flaming
firewood
on
which
to
cook
them
and
his
cup
was
filled
with
good
liquor
every
day
and
neither
wet
nor
heat
nor
cold
affects
me
in
this
at
the
noon
hour
miraculous
nourishment
was
brought
for
the
whole
crew
and
thereafter
the
ancient
man
said
to
them
ye
will
all
reach
your
country
and
the
man
that
slew
thy
father
o
maeldūn
ye
will
find
him
in
a
fortress
before
you
and
slay
him
not
but
forgive
him
because
god
hath
saved
you
from
manifold
great
perils
and
ye
too
are
men
deserving
of
then
they
bade
him
farewell
and
went
on
their
accustomed
way
island
of
the
this
is
uninhabited
save
for
herds
of
sheep
and
oxen
they
land
on
it
and
eat
their
fill
and
one
of
them
sees
there
a
large
falcon
this
falcon
he
says
is
like
the
falcons
of
watch
it
says
maeldūn
and
see
how
it
will
go
from
it
flew
off
to
the
and
they
rowed
after
it
all
day
till
vespers
at
nightfall
they
sighted
a
land
like
ireland
and
soon
came
to
a
small
island
where
they
ran
their
prow
ashore
it
was
the
island
where
dwelt
the
man
who
had
slain
ailill
they
went
up
to
the
dūn
that
was
on
the
island
and
heard
men
talking
within
it
as
they
sat
at
meat
one
man
said
it
would
be
ill
for
us
if
we
saw
maeldūn

it
is
he
who
shall
waken
you
from

said
a

he

said

what
should
we
do
not
hard
to
answer
that
said
the
chief
of

great
welcome
should
he
have
if
he
were
to

for
he
hath
been
a

then
maeldūn
smote
with
the
wooden

against
the

who
is
there
asked
the
doorkeeper
maeldūn
is
here
said
he
they
entered
the
house
in
peace
and
great
welcome
was
made
for
them
and
they
were
arrayed
in
new
garments
and
then
they
told
the
story
of
all
the
marvels
that
god
had
shown
them
according
to
the
words
of
the
sacred
poet
who
said
olim
meminisse
then
maeldūn
went
to
his
own
home
and
kindred
and
diuran
the
rhymer
took
with
him
the
piece
of
silver
that
he
had
hewn
from
the
net
of
the
pillar
and
laid
it
on
the
high
altar
of
armagh
in
triumph
and
exultation
at
the
miracles
that
god
had
wrought
for
them
and
they
told
again
the
story
of
all
that
had
befallen
them
and
all
the
marvels
they
had
seen
by
sea
and
land
and
the
perils
they
had
endured
the
story
ends
with
the
following
words
now
aed
the
fair
aed
finn
chief
sage
of
ireland
arranged
this
story
as
it
standeth
here
and
he
did
so
for
a
delight
to
the
mind
and
for
the
folks
of
ireland
after
chapter
viii
myths
and
tales
of
the
cymry
the
absence
in
early
celtic
literature
of
any
or
any
philosophic
account
of
the
origin
and
constitution
of
things
was
noticed
at
the
opening
of
our
third
chapter
in
gaelic
literature
there
is
as
far
as
i
know
nothing
which
even
pretends
to
represent
early
celtic
thought
on
this
subject
it
is
otherwise
in
wales
here
there
has
existed
for
a
considerable
time
a
body
of
teaching
purporting
to
contain
a
portion
at
any
rate
of
that
ancient
druidic
thought
which
as
caesar
tells
us
was
communicated
only
to
the
initiated
and
never
written
down
this
teaching
is
principally
to
be
found
in
two
volumes
entitled
barddas
a
compilation
made
from
materials
in
his
possession
by
a
welsh
bard
and
scholar
named
llewellyn
sion
of
glamorgan
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
edited
with
a
translation
by
williams
ap
ithel
for
the
welsh
society
modern
celtic
scholars
pour
contempt
on
the
pretensions
of
works
like
this
to
enshrine
any
really
antique
thought
thus
ivor
john
all
idea
of
a
bardic
esoteric
doctrine
involving
mythic
philosophy
must
be
utterly
and
again
the
nonsense
talked
upon
the
subject
is
largely
due
to
the
uncritical
invention
of
of
the
sixteenth
to
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
still
the
bardic
order
was
certainly
at
one
time
in
possession
of
such
a
doctrine
that
order
had
a
fairly
continuous
existence
in
wales
and
though
no
critical
thinker
would
build
with
any
confidence
a
theory
of
doctrine
on
a
document
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
does
not
seem
wise
to
scout
altogether
the
possibility
that
some
fragments
of
antique
lore
may
have
lingered
even
so
late
as
that
in
bardic
tradition
at
any
rate
barddas
is
a
work
of
considerable
philosophic
interest
and
even
if
it
represents
nothing
but
a
certain
current
of
cymric
thought
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
is
not
unworthy
of
attention
by
the
student
of
things
celtic
purely
druidic
it
does
not
even
profess
to
be
for
christian
personages
and
episodes
from
christian
history
figure
largely
in
it
but
we
come
occasionally
upon
a
strain
of
thought
which
whatever
else
it
may
be
is
certainly
not
christian
and
speaks
of
an
independent
philosophic
system
in
this
system
two
primary
existences
are
contemplated
god
and
cythrawl
who
stand
respectively
for
the
principle
of
energy
tending
towards
life
and
the
principle
of
destruction
tending
towards
nothingness
cythrawl
is
realised
in
annwn
which
may
be
rendered
the
abyss
or
chaos
in
the
beginning
there
was
nothing
but
god
and
annwn
organised
life
began
by
the
pronounced
his
ineffable
name
and
the
manred
was
formed
the
manred
was
the
primal
substance
of
the
universe
it
was
conceived
as
a
multitude
of
minute
indivisible
in
being
a
microcosm
for
god
is
complete
in
each
of
them
while
at
the
same
time
each
is
a
part
of
god
the
whole
the
totality
of
being
as
it
now
exists
is
represented
by
three
concentric
circles
the
innermost
of
them
where
life
sprang
from
annwn
is
called
abred
and
is
the
stage
of
struggle
and
contest
of
life
with
cythrawl
the
next
is
the
circle
of
gwynfyd
or
purity
in
which
life
is
manifested
as
a
pure
rejoicing
force
having
attained
its
triumph
over
evil
the
last
and
outermost
circle
is
called
ceugant
or
infinity
here
all
predicates
fail
us
and
this
circle
represented
graphically
not
by
a
bounding
line
but
by
divergent
rays
is
inhabited
by
god
alone
the
following
extract
from
barddas
in
which
the
alleged
bardic
teaching
is
conveyed
in
catechism
form
will
serve
to
show
the
order
of
ideas
in
which
the
writer
s
mind
moved
the
circles
of
being
the
circles
of
being
q
whence
didst
thou
proceed
a
i
came
from
the
great
world
having
my
beginning
in
annwn
q
where
art
thou
now
and
how
camest
thou
to
what
thou
art
a
i
am
in
the
little
world
whither
i
came
having
traversed
the
circle
of
abred
and
now
i
am
a
man
at
its
termination
and
extreme
limits
q
what
wert
thou
before
thou
didst
become
a
man
in
the
circle
of
abred
a
i
was
in
annwn
the
least
possible
that
was
capable
of
life
and
the
nearest
possible
to
absolute
death
and
i
came
in
every
form
and
through
every
form
capable
of
a
body
and
life
to
the
state
of
man
along
the
circle
of
abred
where
my
condition
was
severe
and
grievous
during
the
age
of
ages
ever
since
i
was
parted
in
annwn
from
the
dead
by
the
gift
of
god
and
his
great
generosity
and
his
unlimited
and
endless
love
q
through
how
many
different
forms
didst
thou
come
and
what
happened
unto
thee
a
through
every
form
capable
of
life
in
water
in
earth
in
air
and
there
happened
unto
me
every
severity
every
hardship
every
evil
and
every
suffering
and
but
little
was
the
goodness
or
gwynfyd
before
i
became
a
man
gwynfyd
can
not
be
obtained
without
seeing
and
knowing
everything
but
it
is
not
possible
to
see
or
to
know
everything
without
suffering
everything
and
there
can
be
no
full
and
perfect
love
that
does
not
produce
those
things
which
are
necessary
to
lead
to
the
knowledge
that
causes
every
being
we
are
told
shall
attain
to
the
circle
of
gwynfyd
at
last
there
is
much
here
that
reminds
us
of
gnostic
or
oriental
thought
it
is
certainly
very
unlike
christian
orthodoxy
of
the
sixteenth
century
as
a
product
of
the
cymric
mind
of
that
period
the
reader
may
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
without
troubling
himself
either
with
antiquarian
theories
or
with
their
refutations
let
us
now
turn
to
the
really
ancient
work
which
is
not
philosophic
but
creative
and
imaginative
produced
by
british
bards
and
fabulists
of
the
middle
ages
but
before
we
go
on
to
set
forth
what
we
shall
find
in
this
literature
we
must
delay
a
moment
to
discuss
one
thing
which
we
shall
not
arthurian
for
the
majority
of
modern
readers
who
have
not
made
any
special
study
of
the
subject
the
mention
of
early
british
legend
will
inevitably
call
up
the
glories
of
the
arthurian
will
think
of
the
fabled
palace
at
the
knights
of
the
round
table
riding
forth
on
chivalrous
adventure
the
quest
of
the
grail
the
guilty
love
of
lancelot
flower
of
knighthood
for
the
queen
the
last
great
battle
by
the
northern
sea
the
voyage
of
arthur
sorely
wounded
but
immortal
to
the
mystic
valley
of
avalon
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
will
find
in
the
native
literature
of
mediæval
wales
little
or
nothing
of
all
round
table
no
lancelot
no
no
isle
of
avalon
until
the
welsh
learned
about
them
from
abroad
and
though
there
was
indeed
an
arthur
in
this
literature
he
is
a
wholly
different
being
from
the
arthur
of
what
we
now
call
the
arthurian
saga
the
earliest
extant
mention
of
arthur
is
to
be
found
in
the
work
of
the
british
historian
nennius
who
wrote
his
historia
britonum
about
the
year
he
derives
his
authority
from
various
monuments
and
writings
of
britain
and
of
ireland
in
connexion
with
the
latter
country
he
records
the
legend
of
partholan
roman
annals
and
chronicles
of
saints
especially
germanus
he
presents
a
fantastically
romanised
and
christianised
view
of
british
history
deriving
the
britons
from
a
trojan
and
roman
ancestry
his
account
of
arthur
however
is
both
sober
and
brief
arthur
who
according
to
nennius
lived
in
the
sixth
century
was
not
a
king
his
ancestry
was
less
noble
than
that
of
many
other
british
chiefs
who
nevertheless
for
his
great
talents
as
a
military
or
chose
him
for
their
leader
against
the
saxons
whom
he
defeated
in
twelve
battles
the
last
being
at
mount
badon
arthur
s
office
was
doubtless
a
relic
of
roman
military
organisation
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
his
historical
existence
however
impenetrable
may
be
the
veil
which
now
obscures
his
valiant
and
often
triumphant
battlings
for
order
and
civilisation
in
that
disastrous
age
of
next
we
have
geoffrey
of
monmouth
bishop
of
asaph
who
wrote
his
historia
regum
britaniæ
in
south
wales
in
the
early
part
of
the
twelfth
century
this
work
is
an
audacious
attempt
to
make
sober
history
out
of
a
mass
of
mythical
or
legendary
matter
mainly
derived
if
we
are
to
believe
the
author
from
an
ancient
book
brought
by
his
uncle
walter
archdeacon
of
oxford
from
brittany
the
mention
of
brittany
in
this
connexion
is
as
we
shall
see
very
significant
geoffrey
wrote
expressly
to
commemorate
the
exploits
of
arthur
who
now
appears
as
a
king
son
of
uther
pendragon
and
of
igerna
wife
of
gorlois
duke
of
cornwall
to
whom
uther
gained
access
in
the
shape
of
her
husband
through
the
magic
arts
of
merlin
he
places
the
beginning
of
arthur
s
reign
in
the
year
recounts
his
wars
against
the
saxons
and
says
he
ultimately
conquered
not
only
all
britain
but
ireland
norway
gaul
and
dacia
and
successfully
resisted
a
demand
for
tribute
and
homage
from
the
romans
he
held
his
court
at
while
he
was
away
on
the
continent
carrying
on
his
struggle
with
rome
his
nephew
modred
usurped
his
crown
and
wedded
his
wife
guanhumara
arthur
on
this
returned
and
after
defeating
the
traitor
at
winchester
slew
him
in
a
last
battle
in
cornwall
where
arthur
himself
was
sorely
wounded
the
queen
retired
to
a
convent
at
caerleon
before
his
death
arthur
conferred
his
kingdom
on
his
kinsman
constantine
and
was
then
carried
off
mysteriously
to
the
isle
of
avalon
to
be
cured
and
the
rest
is
arthur
s
magic
sword
caliburn
welsh
see
note
is
mentioned
by
geoffrey
and
described
as
having
been
made
in
avalon
a
word
which
seems
to
imply
some
kind
of
fairyland
a
land
of
the
dead
and
may
be
related
to
the
norse
it
was
not
until
later
times
that
avalon
came
to
be
identified
with
an
actual
site
in
britain
glastonbury
in
geoffrey
s
narrative
there
is
nothing
about
the
holy
grail
or
lancelot
or
the
round
table
and
except
for
the
allusion
to
avalon
the
mystical
element
of
the
arthurian
saga
is
absent
like
nennius
geoffrey
finds
a
fantastic
classical
origin
for
the
britons
his
history
is
perfectly
worthless
as
a
record
of
fact
but
it
has
proved
a
veritable
mine
for
poets
and
chroniclers
and
has
the
distinction
of
having
furnished
the
subject
for
the
earliest
english
tragic
drama
gorboduc
as
well
as
for
shakespeare
s
king
lear
and
its
author
may
be
described
as
the
least
on
its
the
arthurian
saga
which
he
made
up
partly
out
of
records
of
the
historical
of
nennius
and
partly
out
of
poetical
amplifications
of
these
records
made
in
brittany
by
the
descendants
of
exiles
from
wales
many
of
whom
fled
there
at
the
very
time
when
arthur
was
waging
his
wars
against
the
heathen
saxons
geoffrey
s
book
had
a
wonderful
success
it
was
speedily
translated
into
french
by
wace
who
wrote
li
romans
de
brut
about
with
added
details
from
breton
sources
and
translated
from
wace
s
french
into
by
layamon
who
thus
anticipated
malory
s
adaptations
of
late
french
prose
romances
except
a
few
scholars
who
protested
unavailingly
no
one
doubted
its
strict
historical
truth
and
it
had
the
important
effect
of
giving
to
early
british
history
a
new
dignity
in
the
estimation
of
continental
and
of
english
princes
to
sit
upon
the
throne
of
arthur
was
regarded
as
in
itself
a
glory
by
plantagenet
monarchs
who
had
not
a
trace
of
arthur
s
or
of
any
british
blood
saga
in
brittany
marie
de
the
breton
sources
must
next
be
considered
unfortunately
not
a
line
of
ancient
breton
literature
has
come
down
to
us
and
for
our
knowledge
of
it
we
must
rely
on
the
appearances
it
makes
in
the
work
of
french
writers
one
of
the
earliest
of
these
is
the
poetess
who
called
herself
marie
de
france
and
who
wrote
about
and
afterwards
she
wrote
among
other
things
a
number
of
lais
or
tales
which
she
explicitly
and
repeatedly
tells
us
were
translated
or
adapted
from
breton
sources
sometimes
she
claims
to
have
rendered
a
writer
s
original
exactly
les

selunc

l
little
is
actually
said
about
arthur
in
these
tales
but
the
events
of
them
are
placed
in
his
cel
tems
tint
artus
la
the
allusions
which
include
a
mention
of
the
round
table
evidently
imply
a
general
knowledge
of
the
subject
among
those
to
whom
these
breton
lais
were
addressed
lancelot
is
not
mentioned
but
there
is
a
lai
about
one
lanval
who
is
beloved
by
arthur
s
queen
but
rejects
her
because
he
has
a
fairy
mistress
in
the
isle
d
gawain
is
mentioned
and
an
episode
is
told
in
the
lai
de
chevrefoil
about
tristan
and
iseult
whose
maid
brangien
is
referred
to
in
a
way
which
assumes
that
the
audience
knew
the
part
she
had
played
on
iseult
s
bridal
night
in
short
we
have
evidence
here
of
the
existence
in
brittany
of
a
and
body
of
chivalric
legend
gathered
about
the
personality
of
arthur
the
legends
are
so
well
known
that
mere
allusions
to
characters
and
episodes
in
them
are
as
well
understood
as
references
to
tennyson
s
idylls
would
be
among
us
the
lais
of
marie
de
france
therefore
point
strongly
to
brittany
as
the
true
cradle
of
the
arthurian
saga
on
its
chivalrous
and
romantic
side
they
do
not
however
mention
the
grail
de
lastly
and
chiefly
we
have
the
work
of
the
french
poet
chrestien
de
troyes
who
began
in
to
translate
breton
lais
like
marie
de
france
and
who
practically
brought
the
arthurian
saga
into
the
poetic
literature
of
europe
and
gave
it
its
main
outline
and
character
he
wrote
a
tristan
now
lost
he
if
not
walter
map
introduced
lancelot
of
the
lake
into
the
story
he
wrote
a
del
in
which
the
grail
legend
and
perceval
make
their
first
appearance
though
he
left
the
story
unfinished
and
does
not
tell
us
what
the
grail
really
was
he
also
wrote
a
long
d
entitled
erec
containing
the
story
of
geraint
and
enid
these
are
the
earliest
poems
we
possess
in
which
the
arthur
of
chivalric
legend
comes
prominently
forward
what
were
the
sources
of
chrestien
no
doubt
they
were
largely
breton
troyes
is
in
champagne
which
had
been
united
to
blois
in
by
eudes
count
of
blois
and
reunited
again
after
a
period
of
dispossession
by
count
theobald
de
blois
in
marie
countess
of
champagne
was
chrestien
s
patroness
and
there
were
close
connexions
between
the
ruling
princes
of
blois
and
of
brittany
alain
a
duke
of
brittany
had
in
the
tenth
century
married
a
sister
of
the
count
de
blois
and
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
jean
of
brittany
married
blanche
de
champagne
while
their
daughter
alix
married
jean
de
chastillon
count
of
blois
in
it
is
highly
probable
therefore
that
through
minstrels
who
attended
their
breton
lords
at
the
court
of
blois
from
the
middle
of
the
tenth
century
onward
a
great
many
breton
lais
and
legends
found
their
way
into
french
literature
during
the
eleventh
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
but
it
is
also
certain
that
the
breton
legends
themselves
had
been
strongly
affected
by
french
influences
and
that
to
the
de
as
it
was
called
by
mediæval
writers
the
legends
of
charlemagne
and
his
owe
the
table
round
and
the
chivalric
institutions
ascribed
to
arthur
s
court
at
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
as
miss
jessie
weston
has
emphasised
in
her
invaluable
studies
on
the
arthurian
saga
gautier
de
denain
the
earliest
of
the
continuators
or
of
chrestien
de
troyes
mentions
as
his
authority
for
stories
of
gawain
one
bleheris
a
poet
born
and
bred
in
this
forgotten
bard
is
believed
to
be
identical
with
ille
fabulator
bledhericus
mentioned
by
giraldus
cambrensis
and
with
the
bréris
quoted
by
thomas
of
brittany
as
an
authority
for
the
tristan
story
as
to
the
origin
of
the
arthurian
in
the
absence
however
of
any
information
as
to
when
or
exactly
what
bleheris
wrote
the
opinion
must
i
think
hold
the
field
that
the
arthurian
saga
as
we
have
it
now
is
not
of
welsh
nor
even
of
pure
breton
origin
the
welsh
exiles
who
colonised
part
of
brittany
about
the
sixth
century
must
have
brought
with
them
many
stories
of
the
historical
arthur
they
must
also
have
brought
legends
of
the
celtic
deity
artaius
a
god
to
whom
altars
have
been
found
in
france
these
personages
ultimately
blended
into
one
even
as
in
ireland
the
christian
brigit
blended
with
the
pagan
goddess
brigindo
we
thus
get
a
mythical
figure
combining
something
of
the
exaltation
of
a
god
with
a
definite
habitation
on
earth
and
a
place
in
history
an
arthur
saga
thus
arose
which
in
its
breton
though
not
its
welsh
form
was
greatly
enriched
by
material
drawn
in
from
the
legends
of
charlemagne
and
his
peers
while
both
in
brittany
and
in
wales
it
became
a
centre
round
which
clustered
a
mass
of
floating
legendary
matter
relating
to
various
celtic
personages
human
and
divine
chrestien
de
troyes
working
on
breton
material
ultimately
gave
it
the
form
in
which
it
conquered
the
world
and
in
which
it
became
in
the
twelfth
and
the
thirteenth
centuries
what
the
faust
legend
was
in
later
times
the
accepted
vehicle
for
the
ideals
and
aspirations
of
an
epoch
saga
in
from
the
continent
and
especially
from
brittany
the
story
of
arthur
came
back
into
wales
transformed
and
glorified
the
late
heinrich
zimmer
in
one
of
his
luminous
studies
of
the
subject
remarks
that
in
welsh
literature
we
have
definite
evidence
that
the
prince
rhys
ap
tewdwr
who
had
been
in
brittany
brought
from
thence
in
the
year
the
knowledge
of
arthur
s
round
table
to
wales
where
of
course
it
had
been
hitherto
and
many
breton
lords
are
known
to
have
followed
the
banner
of
william
the
conqueror
into
england
the
introducers
of
the
saga
into
wales
found
however
a
considerable
body
of
arthurian
matter
of
a
very
different
character
already
in
existence
there
besides
the
traditions
of
the
historical
arthur
the
of
nennius
there
was
the
celtic
deity
artaius
it
is
probably
a
reminiscence
of
this
deity
whom
we
meet
with
under
the
name
of
arthur
in
the
only
genuine
welsh
arthurian
story
we
possess
the
story
of
kilhwch
and
olwen
in
the
much
of
the
arthurian
saga
derived
from
chrestien
and
other
continental
writers
was
translated
and
adapted
in
wales
as
in
other
european
countries
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
made
a
later
and
a
lesser
impression
in
wales
than
almost
anywhere
else
it
conflicted
with
existing
welsh
traditions
both
historical
and
mythological
it
was
full
of
matter
entirely
foreign
to
the
welsh
spirit
and
it
remained
always
in
wales
something
alien
and
unassimilated
into
ireland
it
never
entered
at
all
these
few
introductory
remarks
do
not
of
course
profess
to
contain
a
discussion
of
the
arthurian
vast
subject
with
myriad
ramifications
historical
mythological
mystical
and
what
are
merely
intended
to
indicate
the
relation
of
that
saga
to
genuine
celtic
literature
and
to
explain
why
we
shall
hear
so
little
of
it
in
the
following
accounts
of
cymric
myths
and
legends
it
was
a
great
spiritual
myth
which
arising
from
the
composite
source
above
described
overran
all
the
continent
as
its
hero
was
supposed
to
have
done
in
armed
conquest
but
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
special
possession
of
the
celtic
race
nor
is
it
at
present
extant
except
in
the
form
of
translation
or
adaptation
in
any
celtic
tongue
and
cymric
legend
the
myths
and
legends
of
the
celtic
race
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
the
welsh
language
are
in
some
respects
of
a
different
character
from
those
which
we
possess
in
gaelic
the
welsh
material
is
nothing
like
as
full
as
the
gaelic
nor
so
early
the
tales
of
the
mabinogion
are
mainly
drawn
from
the
manuscript
entitled
the
red
book
of
one
of
them
the
romance
of
taliesin
came
from
another
source
a
manuscript
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
four
oldest
tales
in
the
mabinogion
are
supposed
by
scholars
to
have
taken
their
present
shape
in
the
tenth
or
eleventh
century
while
several
irish
tales
like
the
story
of
etain
and
midir
or
the
death
of
conary
go
back
to
the
seventh
or
eighth
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
story
of
the
invasion
of
partholan
was
known
to
nennius
who
wrote
about
the
year
as
one
might
therefore
expect
the
mythological
elements
in
the
welsh
romances
are
usually
much
more
confused
and
harder
to
decipher
than
in
the
earlier
of
the
irish
tales
the
mythic
interest
has
grown
less
the
story
interest
greater
the
object
of
the
bard
is
less
to
hand
down
a
sacred
text
than
to
entertain
a
prince
s
court
we
must
remember
also
that
the
influence
of
the
continental
romances
of
chivalry
is
clearly
perceptible
in
the
welsh
tales
and
in
fact
comes
eventually
to
govern
them
completely
and
continental
in
many
respects
the
irish
celt
anticipated
the
ideas
of
these
romances
the
lofty
courtesy
shown
to
each
other
by
enemies
the
fantastic
pride
which
forbade
a
warrior
to
take
advantage
of
a
wounded
adversary
the
extreme
punctilio
with
which
the
duties
or
observances
proper
to
each
man
s
caste
or
station
were
observed
this
tone
of
thought
and
feeling
which
would
seem
so
strange
to
us
if
we
met
an
instance
of
it
in
classical
literature
would
seem
quite
familiar
and
natural
in
continental
romances
of
the
twelfth
and
later
centuries
centuries
earlier
than
that
it
was
a
marked
feature
in
gaelic
literature
yet
in
the
irish
romances
whether
ultonian
or
ossianic
the
element
which
has
since
been
considered
the
most
essential
motive
in
a
romantic
tale
is
almost
entirely
lacking
this
is
the
element
of
love
or
rather
of
the
continental
fabulist
felt
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
this
motive
of
action
but
the
of
the
english
french
or
german
knight
whose
favour
he
wore
for
whose
grace
he
endured
infinite
hardship
and
peril
does
not
meet
us
in
gaelic
literature
it
would
have
seemed
absurd
to
the
irish
celt
to
make
the
plot
of
a
serious
story
hinge
on
the
kind
of
passion
with
which
the
mediaeval
dulcinea
inspired
her
faithful
knight
in
the
two
most
famous
and
popular
of
gaelic
the
tale
of
deirdre
and
the
pursuit
of
dermot
and
grania
the
women
are
the
wooers
and
the
men
are
most
reluctant
to
commit
what
they
know
to
be
the
folly
of
yielding
to
them
now
this
romantic
chivalric
kind
of
love
which
idealised
woman
into
a
goddess
and
made
the
service
of
his
lady
a
sacred
duty
to
the
knight
though
it
never
reached
in
wales
the
height
which
it
did
in
continental
and
english
romances
is
yet
clearly
discernible
there
we
can
trace
it
in
kilhwch
and
olwen
which
is
comparatively
an
ancient
tale
it
is
well
developed
in
later
stories
like
peredur
and
the
lady
of
the
it
is
a
symptom
of
the
extent
to
which
in
comparison
with
the
irish
welsh
literature
had
lost
its
pure
celtic
strain
and
become
do
not
of
course
say
to
its
foreign
influences
and
cymric
mythology
the
oldest
of
the
welsh
tales
those
called
the
four
branches
of
the
mabinogi
are
the
richest
in
mythological
elements
but
these
occur
in
more
or
less
recognisable
form
throughout
nearly
all
the
mediaeval
tales
and
even
after
many
transmutations
in
malory
we
can
clearly
discern
certain
mythological
figures
common
to
all
celtica
we
meet
for
instance
a
personage
called
nudd
or
lludd
evidently
a
solar
deity
a
temple
dating
from
roman
times
and
dedicated
to
him
under
the
name
of
nodens
has
been
discovered
at
lydney
by
the
severn
on
a
bronze
plaque
found
near
the
spot
is
a
representation
of
the
god
he
is
encircled
by
a
halo
and
accompanied
by
flying
spirits
and
by
tritons
we
are
reminded
of
the
danaan
deities
and
their
close
connexion
with
the
sea
and
when
we
find
that
in
welsh
legend
an
epithet
is
attached
to
nudd
meaning
of
the
silver
hand
though
no
extant
welsh
legend
tells
the
meaning
of
the
epithet
we
have
no
difficulty
in
identifying
this
nudd
with
nuada
of
the
silver
hand
who
led
the
danaans
in
the
battle
of
moytura
under
his
name
lludd
he
is
said
to
have
had
a
temple
on
the
site
of
paul

in
london
the

to

find
a

personage
named

with
a

named

playing
a
prominent
part
in

we
may
safely

his

now
leicester

a

finally
we
may
point
to
a
character
in
the

or
tale
entitled
māth
son
of
the
name
of
this
character
is
given
as
llew
llaw
gyffes
which
the
welsh
fabulist
interprets
as
the
lion
of
the

hand
and
a
tale
which
we
shall
recount
later
on
is
told
to
account
for
the
name
but
when
we
find
that
this
hero
exhibits
characteristics
which
point
to
his
being
a
solar
deity
such
as
an
amazingly
rapid
growth
from
childhood
into
manhood
and
when
we
are
told
moreover
by
professor
rhys
that
gyffes
originally
meant
not
steady
or
sure
but
long
it
becomes
evident
that
we
have
here
a
dim
and
broken
reminiscence
of
the
deity
whom
the
gaels
called
lugh
of
the
long
arm
lamh
the
misunderstood
name
survived
and
round
the
misunderstanding
legendary
matter
floating
in
the
popular
mind
crystallised
itself
in
a
new
story
these
correspondences
might
be
pursued
in
much
further
detail
it
is
enough
here
to
point
to
their
existence
as
evidence
of
the
original
community
of
gaelic
and
cymric
mythology
we
are
in
each
literature
in
the
same
circle
of
mythological
ideas
in
wales
however
these
ideas
are
harder
to
discern
the
figures
and
their
relationships
in
the
welsh
olympus
are
less
accurately
defined
and
more
fluctuating
it
would
seem
as
if
a
number
of
different
tribes
embodied
what
were
fundamentally
the
same
conceptions
under
different
names
and
wove
different
legends
about
them
the
bardic
literature
as
we
have
it
now
bears
evidence
sometimes
of
the
prominence
of
one
of
these
tribal
cults
sometimes
of
another
to
reduce
these
varying
accounts
to
unity
is
altogether
impossible
still
we
can
do
something
to
afford
the
reader
a
clue
to
the
maze
houses
of
dōn
and
of
two
great
divine
houses
or
families
are
of
dōn
a
representing
the
gaelic
dana
whose
husband
is
beli
the
irish
bilé
god
of
death
and
whose
descendants
are
the
children
of
light
and
the
house
of
llyr
the
gaelic
lir
who
here
represents
not
a
danaan
deity
but
something
more
like
the
irish
fomorians
as
in
the
case
of
the
irish
myth
the
two
families
are
allied
by
a
daughter
of
dōn
is
wedded
to
llyr
dōn
herself
has
a
brother
māth
whose
name
signifies
wealth
or
treasure
greek
pluton
and
they
descend
from
a
figure
indistinctly
characterised
called
māthonwy
house
of
into
the
pantheon
of
deities
represented
in
the
four
ancient
mabinogi
there
came
at
a
later
time
from
some
other
tribal
source
another
group
headed
by
arthur
the
god
artaius
he
takes
the
place
of
gwydion
son
of
dōn
and
the
other
deities
of
his
circle
fall
more
or
less
accurately
into
the
places
of
others
of
the
earlier
circle
the
accompanying
genealogical
plans
are
intended
to
help
the
reader
to
a
general
view
of
the
relationships
and
attributes
of
these
personages
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
these
tabular
arrangements
necessarily
involve
an
appearance
of
precision
and
consistency
which
is
not
reflected
in
the
fluctuating
character
of
the
actual
myths
taken
as
a
whole
still
as
a
of
a
very
intricate
and
obscure
region
they
may
help
the
reader
who
enters
it
for
the
first
time
to
find
his
bearings
in
it
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
they
propose
to
serve
ap
the
deity
named
gwyn
ap
nudd
is
said
like
finn
in
gaelic
legend
to
have
impressed
himself
more
deeply
and
lastingly
on
the
welsh
popular
imagination
than
any
of
the
other
divinities
a
mighty
warrior
and
huntsman
he
glories
in
the
crash
of
breaking
spears
and
like
odin
assembles
the
souls
of
dead
heroes
in
his
shadowy
kingdom
for
although
he
belongs
to
the
kindred
of
the
hades
is
his
special
domain
the
combat
between
him
and

holds
in
arthur
s
mythological
cycle
the
place
of
the
and
nudd
one
of
the
welsh
triads
tells
us
that
britain
before
it
was
inhabited
was
called
myrddin
s
enclosure
one
is
reminded
of
the
irish
fashion
of
calling
any
favoured
spot
a
of
the
sun
name
is
applied
by
deirdre
to
her
beloved
scottish
home
in
glen
etive
professor
rhys
suggests
that
myrddin
was
the
deity
specially
worshipped
at
stonehenge
which
according
to
british
tradition
as
reported
by
geoffrey
of
monmouth
was
erected
by
merlin
the
enchanter
who
represents
the
form
into
which
myrddin
had
dwindled
under
christian
influences
we
are
told
that
the
abode
of
merlin
was
a
house
of
glass
or
a
bush
of
whitethorn
laden
with
bloom
or
a
sort
of
smoke
or
mist
in
the
air
or
a
close
neither
of
iron
nor
steel
nor
timber
nor
of
stone
but
of
the
air
without
any
other
thing
by
enchantment
so
strong
that
it
may
never
be
undone
while
the
world
finally
he
descended
upon
bardsey
island
off
the
extreme
westernmost
point
of
carnarvonshire
into
it
he
went
with
nine
attendant
bards
taking
with
him
the
thirteen
treasures
of
britain
thenceforth
lost
to
professor
rhys
points
out
that
a
greek
traveller
named
demetrius
who
is
described
as
having
visited
britain
in
the
first
century
mentions
an
island
in
the
west
where
kronos
was
supposed
to
be
imprisoned
with
his
attendant
deities
and
briareus
keeping
watch
over
him
as
he
slept
for
sleep
was
the
bond
forged
for
doubtless
we
have
here
a
version
hellenised
as
was
the
wont
of
classical
writers
on
barbaric
myths
of
a
british
story
of
the
descent
of
the
into
the
western
sea
and
his
imprisonment
there
by
the
powers
of
darkness
with
the
possessions
and
magical
potencies
belonging
to
light
and
life
and
the
two
personages
called
nynniaw
and
peibaw
who
figure
in
the
genealogical
table
play
a
very
slight
part
in
cymric
mythology
but
one
story
in
which
they
appear
is
interesting
in
itself
and
has
an
excellent
moral
they
are
represented
as
two
brothers
kings
of
britain
who
were
walking
together
one
starlight
night
see
what
a
fine
field
i
have
said
nynniaw
where
is
it
asked
peibaw
there
aloft
and
as
far
as
you
can
see
said
nynniaw
pointing
to
the
sky
but
look
at
all
my
cattle
grazing
in
your
field
said
peibaw
where
are
they
said
nynniaw
all
the
golden
stars
said
peibaw
with
the
moon
for
their
they
shall
not
graze
on
my
field
cried
nynniaw
i
say
they
shall
returned
peibaw
they
shall
they
and
so
they
went
on
first
they
quarrelled
with
each
other
and
then
went
to
war
and
armies
were
destroyed
and
lands
laid
waste
till
at
last
the
two
brothers
were
turned
into
oxen
as
a
punishment
for
their
stupidity
and
quarrelsomeness
we
now
come
to
the
work
in
which
the
chief
treasures
of
cymric
myth
and
legend
were
collected
by
lady
charlotte
guest
sixty
years
ago
and
given
to
the
world
in
a
translation
which
is
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
english
literature
the
title
of
this
work
the
mabinogion
is
the
plural
form
of
the
word
which
means
a
story
belonging
to
the
equipment
of
an
such
a
story
as
every
bard
had
necessarily
to
learn
as
part
of
his
training
whatever
more
he
might
afterwards
add
to
his
strictly
speaking
the
in
the
volume
are
only
the
four
tales
given
first
in
alfred
nutt
s
edition
which
were
entitled
the
four
branches
of
the
mabinogi
and
which
form
a
connected
whole
they
are
among
the
oldest
relics
of
welsh
mythological
saga
head
of
the
first
of
them
is
the
story
of
pwyll
prince
of
dyfed
and
relates
how
that
prince
got
his
title
of
or
head
of
hades
being
the
term
under
which
we
identify
in
welsh
literature
the
celtic
land
of
the
dead
or
fairyland
it
is
a
story
with
a
mythological
basis
but
breathing
the
purest
spirit
of
chivalric
honour
and
nobility
pwyll
it
is
said
was
hunting
one
day
in
the
woods
of
glyn
cuch
when
he
saw
a
pack
of
hounds
not
his
own
running
down
a
stag
these
hounds
were
in
colour
with
red
ears
if
pwyll
had
had
any
experience
in
these
matters
he
would
have
known
at
once
what
kind
of
hunt
was
up
for
these
are
the
colours
of
man
the
hound
are
always
associated
with
magic
pwyll
however
drove
off
the
strange
hounds
and
was
setting
his
own
on
the
quarry
when
a
horseman
of
noble
appearance
came
up
and
reproached
him
for
his
discourtesy
pwyll
offered
to
make
amends
and
the
story
now
develops
into
the
familiar
theme
of
the
rescue
of
fairyland
the
stranger
s
name
is
arawn
a
king
in
annwn
he
is
being
harried
and
dispossessed
by
a
rival
havgan
and
he
seeks
the
aid
of
pwyll
whom
he
begs
to
meet
havgan
in
single
combat
a
year
hence
meanwhile
he
will
put
his
own
shape
on
pwyll
who
is
to
rule
in
his
kingdom
till
the
eventful
day
while
arawn
will
go
in
pwyll
s
shape
to
govern
dyfed
he
instructs
pwyll
how
to
deal
with
the
foe
havgan
must
be
laid
low
with
a
single
another
is
given
to
him
he
immediately
revives
again
as
strong
as
ever
pwyll
agreed
to
follow
up
the
adventure
and
accordingly
went
in
arawn
s
shape
to
the
kingdom
of
annwn
here
he
was
placed
in
an
unforeseen
difficulty
the
beautiful
wife
of
arawn
greeted
him
as
her
husband
but
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
retire
to
rest
he
set
his
face
to
the
wall
and
said
no
word
to
her
nor
touched
her
at
all
until
the
morning
broke
then
they
rose
up
and
pwyll
went
to
the
hunt
and
ruled
his
kingdom
and
did
all
things
as
if
he
were
monarch
of
the
land
and
whatever
affection
he
showed
to
the
queen
in
public
during
the
day
he
passed
every
night
even
as
this
first
at
last
the
day
of
battle
came
and
like
the
chieftains
in
gaelic
story
pwyll
and
havgan
met
each
other
in
the
midst
of
a
they
fought
and
at
the
first
clash
havgan
was
hurled
a
spear
s
length
over
the
crupper
of
his
horse
and
fell
mortally
wounded
for
the
love
of
heaven
said
he
slay
me
and
complete
thy
i
may
yet
repent
that
said
pwyll
slay
thee
who
may
i
will
then
havgan
knew
that
his
end
was
come
and
bade
his
nobles
bear
him
off
and
pwyll
with
all
his
army
overran
the
two
kingdoms
of
annwn
and
made
himself
master
of
all
the
land
and
took
homage
from
its
princes
and
lords
then
he
rode
off
alone
to
keep
his
tryst
in
glyn
cuch
with
arawn
as
they
had
appointed
arawn
thanked
him
for
all
he
had
done
and
added
when
thou
comest
thyself
to
thine
own
dominions
thou
wilt
see
what
i
have
done
for
they
exchanged
shapes
once
more
and
each
rode
in
his
own
likeness
to
take
possession
of
his
own
land
at
the
court
of
annwn
the
day
was
spent
in
joy
and
feasting
though
none
but
arawn
himself
knew
that
anything
unusual
had
taken
place
when
night
came
arawn
kissed
and
caressed
his
wife
as
of
old
and
she
pondered
much
as
to
what
might
be
the
cause
of
his
change
towards
her
and
of
his
previous
change
a
year
and
a
day
before
and
as
she
was
thinking
over
these
things
arawn
spoke
to
her
twice
or
thrice
but
got
no
answer
he
then
asked
her
why
she
was
silent
i
tell
thee
she
said
that
for
a
year
i
have
not
spoken
so
much
in
this
did
not
we
speak
continually
he
said
nay
said
she
but
for
a
year
back
there
has
been
neither
converse
nor
tenderness
between
good
heaven
thought
arawn
a
man
as
faithful
and
firm
in
his
friendship
as
any
have
i
found
for
a
then
he
told
his
queen
what
had
passed
thou
hast
indeed
laid
hold
of
a
faithful
friend
she
said
and
pwyll
when
he
came
back
to
his
own
land
called
his
lords
together
and
asked
them
how
they
thought
he
had
sped
in
his
kingship
during
the
past
year
lord
said
they
thy
wisdom
was
never
so
great
and
thou
wast
never
so
kind
and
free
in
bestowing
thy
gifts
and
thy
justice
was
never
more
worthily
seen
than
in
this
pwyll
then
told
them
the
story
of
his
adventure
verily
lord
said
they
render
thanks
unto
heaven
that
thou
hast
such
a
fellowship
and
withhold
not
from
us
the
rule
which
we
have
enjoyed
for
this
year
i
take
heaven
to
witness
that
i
will
not
withhold
it
said
pwyll
so
the
two
kings
made
strong
the
friendship
that
was
between
them
and
sent
each
other
rich
gifts
of
horses
and
hounds
and
jewels
and
in
memory
of
the
adventure
pwyll
bore
thenceforward
the
title
of
lord
of
wedding
of
pwyll
and
near
to
the
castle
of
narberth
where
pwyll
had
his
court
there
was
a
mound
called
the
mound
of
arberth
of
which
it
was
believed
that
whoever
sat
upon
it
would
have
a
strange
adventure
either
he
would
receive
blows
and
wounds
or
he
would
see
a
wonder
one
day
when
all
his
lords
were
assembled
at
narberth
for
a
feast
pwyll
declared
that
he
would
sit
on
the
mound
and
see
what
would
befall
he
did
so
and
after
a
little
while
saw
approaching
him
along
the
road
that
led
to
the
mound
a
lady
clad
in
garments
that
shone
like
gold
and
sitting
on
a
pure
white
horse
is
there
any
among
you
said
pwyll
to
his
men
who
knows
that
lady
there
is
not
said
they
then
go
to
meet
her
and
learn
who
she
but
as
they
rode
towards
the
lady
she
moved
away
from
them
and
however
fast
they
rode
she
still
kept
an
even
distance
between
her
and
them
yet
never
seemed
to
exceed
the
quiet
pace
with
which
she
had
first
approached
several
times
did
pwyll
seek
to
have
the
lady
overtaken
and
questioned
but
all
was
in
could
draw
near
to
her
next
day
pwyll
ascended
the
mound
again
and
once
more
the
fair
lady
on
her
white
steed
drew
near
this
time
pwyll
himself
pursued
her
but
she
flitted
away
before
him
as
she
had
done
before
his
servants
till
at
last
he
cried
o
maiden
for
the
sake
of
him
thou
best
lovest
stay
for
i
will
stay
gladly
said
she
and
it
were
better
for
thy
horse
had
thou
asked
it
long
pwyll
then
questioned
her
as
to
the
cause
of
her
coming
and
she
said
i
am
rhiannon
the
daughter
of
hevydd
hēn
and
they
sought
to
give
me
to
a
husband
against
my
will
but
no
husband
would
i
have
and
that
because
of
my
love
for
thee
neither
will
i
yet
have
one
if
thou
reject
by
heaven
said
pwyll
if
i
might
choose
among
all
the
ladies
and
damsels
of
the
world
thee
would
i
they
then
agree
that
in
a
twelvemonth
from
that
day
pwyll
is
to
come
and
claim
her
at
the
palace
of
hevydd
hēn
pwyll
kept
his
tryst
with
a
following
of
a
hundred
knights
and
found
a
splendid
feast
prepared
for
him
and
he
sat
by
his
lady
with
her
father
on
the
other
side
as
they
feasted
and
talked
there
entered
a
tall
youth
of
royal
bearing
clad
in
satin
who
saluted
pwyll
and
his
knights
pwyll
invited
him
to
sit
down
nay
i
am
a
suitor
to
thee
said
the
youth
to
crave
a
boon
am
i
whatever
thou
wilt
thou
shalt
have
said
pwyll
unsuspiciously
if
it
be
in
my
ah
cried
rhiannon
wherefore
didst
thou
give
that
answer
hath
he
not
given
it
before
all
these
nobles
said
the
youth
and
now
the
boon
i
crave
is
to
have
thy
bride
rhiannon
and
the
feast
and
the
banquet
that
are
in
this
pwyll
was
silent
be
silent
as
long
as
thou
wilt
said
rhiannon
never
did
man
make
worse
use
of
his
wits
than
thou
hast
she
tells
him
that
the
young
man
is
gwawl
son
of
clud
and
is
the
suitor
to
escape
from
whom
she
had
fled
to
pwyll
pwyll
is
bound
in
honour
by
his
word
and
rhiannon
explains
that
the
banquet
can
not
be
given
to
gwawl
for
it
is
not
in
pwyll
s
power
but
that
she
herself
will
be
his
bride
in
a
twelvemonth
gwawl
is
to
come
and
claim
her
then
and
a
new
bridal
feast
will
be
prepared
for
him
meantime
she
concerts
a
plan
with
pwyll
and
gives
him
a
certain
magical
bag
which
he
is
to
make
use
of
when
the
time
shall
come
a
year
passed
away
gwawl
appeared
according
to
the
compact
and
a
great
feast
was
again
set
forth
in
which
he
and
not
pwyll
had
the
place
of
honour
as
the
company
were
making
merry
however
a
beggar
clad
in
rags
and
shod
with
clumsy
old
shoes
came
into
the
hall
carrying
a
bag
as
beggars
are
wont
to
do
he
humbly
craved
a
boon
of
gwawl
it
was
merely
that
the
full
of
his
bag
of
food
might
be
given
him
from
the
banquet
gwawl
cheerfully
consented
and
an
attendant
went
to
fill
the
bag
but
however
much
they
put
into
it
it
never
got
degrees
all
the
good
things
on
the
tables
had
gone
in
and
at
last
gwawl
cried
my
soul
will
thy
bag
never
be
full
it
will
not
i
declare
to
heaven
answered
he
of
course
was
the
disguised
beggar
unless
some
man
wealthy
in
lands
and
treasure
shall
get
into
the
bag
and
stamp
it
down
with
his
feet
and
declare
enough
has
been
put
rhiannon
urged
gwawl
to
check
the
voracity
of
the
bag
he
put
his
two
feet
into
it
pwyll
immediately
drew
up
the
sides
of
the
bag
over
gwawl
s
head
and
tied
it
up
then
he
blew
his
horn
and
the
knights
he
had
with
him
who
were
concealed
outside
rushed
in
and
captured
and
bound
the
followers
of
gwawl
what
is
in
the
bag
they
cried
and
others
answered
a
badger
and
so
they
played
the
game
of
badger
in
the
bag
striking
it
and
kicking
it
about
the
hall
at
last
a
voice
was
heard
from
it
lord
cried
gwawl
if
thou
wouldst
but
hear
me
i
merit
not
to
be
slain
in
a
he
speaks
truth
said
hevydd
hēn
so
an
agreement
was
come
to
that
gwawl
should
provide
means
for
pwyll
to
satisfy
all
the
suitors
and
minstrels
who
should
come
to
the
wedding
and
abandon
rhiannon
and
never
seek
to
have
revenge
for
what
had
been
done
to
him
this
was
confirmed
by
sureties
and
gwawl
and
his
men
were
released
and
went
to
their
own
territory
and
pwyll
wedded
rhiannon
and
dispensed
gifts
royally
to
all
and
sundry
and
at
last
the
pair
when
the
feasting
was
done
journeyed
down
to
the
palace
of
narberth
in
dyfed
where
rhiannon
gave
rich
gifts
a
bracelet
and
a
ring
or
a
precious
stone
to
all
the
lords
and
ladies
of
her
new
country
and
they
ruled
the
land
in
peace
both
that
year
and
the
next
but
the
reader
will
find
that
we
have
not
yet
done
with
gwawl
penance
of
now
pwyll
was
still
without
an
heir
to
the
throne
and
his
nobles
urged
him
to
take
another
wife
grant
us
a
year
longer
said
he
and
if
there
be
no
heir
after
that
it
shall
be
as
you
before
the
year
s
end
a
son
was
born
to
them
in
narberth
but
although
six
women
sat
up
to
watch
the
mother
and
the
infant
it
happened
towards
the
morning
that
they
all
fell
asleep
and
rhiannon
also
slept
and
when
the
women
awoke
behold
the
boy
was
gone
we
shall
be
burnt
for
this
said
the
women
and
in
their
terror
they
concocted
a
horrible
plot
they
killed
a
cub
of
a
staghound
that
had
just
been
littered
and
laid
the
bones
by
rhiannon
and
smeared
her
face
and
hands
with
blood
as
she
slept
and
when
she
woke
and
asked
for
her
child
they
said
she
had
devoured
it
in
the
night
and
had
overcome
them
with
furious
strength
when
they
would
have
prevented
for
all
she
could
say
or
do
the
six
women
persisted
in
this
story
when
the
story
was
told
to
pwyll
he
would
not
put
away
rhiannon
as
his
nobles
now
again
begged
him
to
do
but
a
penance
was
imposed
on
that
she
was
to
sit
every
day
by
the
at
the
gate
of
the
castle
and
tell
the
tale
to
every
stranger
who
came
and
offer
to
carry
them
on
her
back
into
the
castle
and
this
she
did
for
part
of
a
year
finding
of
now
at
this
time
there
lived
a
man
named
teirnyon
of
gwent
is
coed
who
had
the
most
beautiful
mare
in
the
world
but
there
was
this
misfortune
attending
her
that
although
she
foaled
on
the
night
of
every
first
of
may
none
ever
knew
what
became
of
the
colts
at
last
teirnyon
resolved
to
get
at
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
the
next
night
on
which
the
mare
should
foal
he
armed
himself
and
watched
in
the
stable
so
the
mare
foaled
and
the
colt
stood
up
and
teirnyon
was
admiring
its
size
and
beauty
when
a
great
noise
was
heard
outside
and
a
long
clawed
arm
came
through
the
window
of
the
stable
and
laid
hold
of
the
colt
teirnyon
immediately
smote
at
the
arm
with
his
sword
and
severed
it
at
the
elbow
so
that
it
fell
inside
with
the
colt
and
a
great
wailing
and
tumult
was
heard
outside
he
rushed
out
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
but
could
see
nothing
because
of
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
he
followed
the
noise
a
little
way
then
he
came
back
and
behold
at
the
door
he
found
an
infant
in
and
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
satin
he
took
up
the
child
and
brought
it
to
where
his
wife
lay
sleeping
she
had
no
children
and
she
loved
the
child
when
she
saw
it
and
next
day
pretended
to
her
women
that
she
had
borne
it
as
her
own
and
they
called
its
name
gwri
of
the
golden
hair
for
its
hair
was
yellow
as
gold
and
it
grew
so
mightily
that
in
two
years
it
was
as
big
and
strong
as
a
child
of
six
and
ere
long
the
colt
that
had
been
foaled
on
the
same
night
was
broken
in
and
given
him
to
ride
while
these
things
were
going
on
teirnyon
heard
the
tale
of
rhiannon
and
her
punishment
and
as
the
lad
grew
up
he
scanned
his
face
closely
and
saw
that
he
had
the
features
of
pwyll
prince
of
dyfed
this
he
told
to
his
wife
and
they
agreed
that
the
child
should
be
taken
to
narberth
and
rhiannon
released
from
her
penance
as
they
drew
near
to
the
castle
teirnyon
and
two
knights
and
the
child
riding
on
his
colt
there
was
rhiannon
sitting
by
the
chieftains
said
she
go
not
further
thus
i
will
bear
every
one
of
you
into
the
palace
and
this
is
my
penance
for
slaying
my
own
son
and
devouring
but
they
would
not
be
carried
and
went
in
pwyll
rejoiced
to
see
teirnyon
and
made
a
feast
for
him
afterwards
teirnyon
declared
to
pwyll
and
rhiannon
the
adventure
of
the
man
and
the
colt
and
how
they
had
found
the
boy
and
behold
here
is
thy
son
lady
said
teirnyon
and
whoever
told
that
lie
concerning
thee
has
done
all
who
sat
at
table
recognised
the
lad
at
once
as
the
child
of
pwyll
and
rhiannon
cried
i
declare
to
heaven
that
if
this
be
true
there
is
an
end
to
my
and
a
chief
named
pendaran
said
well
hast
thou
named
thy
son
pryderi
trouble
and
well
becomes
him
the
name
of
pryderi
son
of
pwyll
lord
of
it
was
agreed
that
his
name
should
be
pryderi
and
so
he
was
called
thenceforth
teirnyon
rode
home
overwhelmed
with
thanks
and
love
and
gladness
and
pwyll
offered
him
rich
gifts
of
horses
and
jewels
and
dogs
but
he
would
take
none
of
them
and
pryderi
was
trained
up
as
befitted
a
king
s
son
in
all
noble
ways
and
accomplishments
and
when
his
father
pwyll
died
he
reigned
in
his
stead
over
the
seven
cantrevs
of
dyfed
and
he
added
to
them
many
other
fair
dominions
and
at
last
he
took
to
wife
kicva
daughter
of
gwynn
gohoyw
who
came
of
the
lineage
of
prince
casnar
of
britain
tale
of
bran
and
bendigeid
vran
or
bran
the
blessed
by
which
latter
name
we
shall
designate
him
here
when
he
had
been
made
king
of
the
isle
of
the
mighty
britain
was
one
time
in
his
court
at
harlech
and
he
had
with
him
his
brother
manawyddan
son
of
llyr
and
his
sister
branwen
and
the
two
sons
nissyen
and
evnissyen
that
penardun
his
mother
bore
to
eurosswyd
now
nissyen
was
a
youth
of
gentle
nature
and
would
make
peace
among
his
kindred
and
cause
them
to
be
friends
when
their
wrath
was
at
its
highest
but
evnissyen
loved
nothing
so
much
as
to
turn
peace
into
contention
and
strife
one
afternoon
as
bran
son
of
llyr
sat
on
the
rock
of
harlech
looking
out
to
sea
he
beheld
thirteen
ships
coming
rapidly
from
ireland
before
a
fair
wind
they
were
gaily
furnished
bright
flags
flying
from
the
masts
and
on
the
foremost
ship
when
they
came
near
a
man
could
be
seen
holding
up
a
shield
with
the
point
upwards
in
sign
of
peace
when
the
strangers
landed
they
saluted
bran
and
explained
their
business
matholwch
king
of
ireland
was
with
them
his
were
the
ships
and
he
had
come
to
ask
for
the
hand
in
marriage
of
bran
s
sister
branwen
so
that
ireland
and
britain
might
be
leagued
together
and
both
become
more
powerful
now
branwen
was
one
of
the
three
chief
ladies
of
the
island
and
she
was
the
fairest
damsel
in
the
the
irish
were
hospitably
entertained
and
after
taking
counsel
with
his
lords
bran
agreed
to
give
his
sister
to
matholwch
the
place
of
the
wedding
was
fixed
at
aberffraw
and
the
company
assembled
for
the
feast
in
tents
because
no
house
could
hold
the
giant
form
of
bran
they
caroused
and
made
merry
in
peace
and
amity
and
branwen
became
the
bride
or
the
irish
king
next
day
evnissyen
came
by
chance
to
where
the
horses
of
matholwch
were
ranged
and
he
asked
whose
they
were
they
are
the
horses
of
matholwch
who
is
married
to
thy
and
is
it
thus
said
he
they
have
done
with
a
maiden
such
as
she
and
moreover
my
sister
bestowing
her
without
my
consent
they
could
offer
me
no
greater
thereupon
he
rushed
among
the
horses
and
cut
off
their
lips
at
the
teeth
and
their
ears
to
their
heads
and
their
tails
close
to
the
body
and
where
he
could
seize
the
eyelids
he
cut
them
off
to
the
bone
when
matholwch
heard
what
had
been
done
he
was
both
angered
and
bewildered
and
bade
his
people
put
to
sea
bran
sent
messengers
to
learn
what
had
happened
and
when
he
had
been
informed
he
sent
manawyddan
and
two
others
to
make
atonement
matholwch
should
have
sound
horses
for
every
one
that
was
injured
and
in
addition
a
staff
of
silver
as
large
and
as
tall
as
himself
and
a
plate
of
gold
the
size
of
his
face
and
let
him
come
and
meet
me
he
added
and
we
will
make
peace
in
any
way
he
may
but
as
for
evnissyen
he
was
the
son
of
bran
s
mother
and
therefore
bran
could
not
put
him
to
death
as
he
deserved
magic
matholwch
accepted
these
terms
but
not
very
cheerfully
and
bran
now
offered
another
treasure
namely
a
magic
cauldron
which
had
the
property
that
if
a
slain
man
were
cast
into
it
he
would
come
forth
well
and
sound
only
he
would
not
be
able
to
speak
matholwch
and
bran
then
talked
about
the
cauldron
which
originally
it
seems
came
from
ireland
there
was
a
lake
in
that
country
near
to
a
mound
doubtless
a
fairy
mound
which
was
called
the
lake
of
the
cauldron
here
matholwch
had
once
met
a
tall
and
fellow
with
a
wife
bigger
than
himself
and
the
cauldron
strapped
on
his
back
they
took
service
with
matholwch
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
six
weeks
the
wife
gave
birth
to
a
son
who
was
a
warrior
fully
armed
we
are
apparently
to
understand
that
this
happened
every
six
weeks
for
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
strange
pair
who
seem
to
be
a
and
goddess
had
several
children
whose
continual
bickering
and
the
outrages
they
committed
throughout
the
land
made
them
hated
at
last
to
get
rid
of
them
matholwch
had
a
house
of
iron
made
and
enticed
them
into
it
he
then
barred
the
door
and
heaped
coals
about
the
chamber
and
blew
them
into
a
white
heat
hoping
to
roast
the
whole
family
to
death
as
soon
however
as
the
iron
walls
had
grown
and
soft
the
man
and
his
wife
burst
through
them
and
got
away
but
the
children
remained
behind
and
were
destroyed
bran
then
took
up
the
story
the
man
who
was
called
llassar
llaesgyvnewid
and
his
wife
kymideu
kymeinvoll
come
across
to
britain
where
bran
took
them
in
and
in
return
for
his
kindness
they
gave
him
the
cauldron
and
since
then
they
had
filled
the
land
with
their
descendants
who
prospered
everywhere
and
dwelt
in
strong
fortified
burgs
and
had
the
best
weapons
that
ever
were
seen
so
matholwch
received
the
cauldron
along
with
his
bride
and
sailed
back
to
ireland
where
branwen
entertained
the
lords
and
ladies
of
the
land
and
gave
to
each
as
he
or
she
took
leave
either
a
clasp
or
a
ring
or
a
royal
jewel
to
keep
such
as
it
was
honourable
to
be
seen
departing
and
when
the
year
was
out
branwen
bore
a
son
to
matholwch
whose
name
was
called
gwern
punishment
of
there
occurs
now
an
unintelligible
place
in
the
story
in
the
second
year
it
appears
and
not
till
then
the
men
of
ireland
grew
indignant
over
the
insult
to
their
king
committed
by
evnissyen
and
took
revenge
for
it
by
having
branwen
degraded
to
the
position
of
a
cook
and
they
caused
the
butcher
every
day
to
give
her
a
blow
on
the
ears
they
also
forbade
all
ships
and
to
cross
to
cambria
and
any
who
came
thence
into
ireland
were
imprisoned
so
that
news
of
branwen
s
might
not
come
to
the
ears
of
bran
but
branwen
reared
up
a
young
starling
in
a
corner
of
her
and
one
day
she
tied
a
letter
under
its
wing
and
taught
it
what
to
do
it
flew
away
towards
britain
and
finding
bran
at
caer
seiont
in
arvon
it
lit
on
his
shoulder
ruffling
its
feathers
and
the
letter
was
found
and
read
bran
immediately
prepared
a
great
hosting
for
ireland
and
sailed
thither
with
a
fleet
of
ships
leaving
his
land
of
britain
under
his
son
caradawc
and
six
other
chiefs
invasion
of
soon
there
came
messengers
to
matholwch
telling
him
of
a
wondrous
sight
they
had
seen
a
wood
was
growing
on
the
sea
and
beside
the
wood
a
mountain
with
a
high
ridge
in
the
middle
of
it
and
two
lakes
one
at
each
side
and
wood
and
mountain
moved
towards
the
shore
of
ireland
branwen
is
called
up
to
explain
if
she
could
what
this
meant
she
tells
them
the
wood
is
the
masts
and
yards
of
the
fleet
of
britain
and
the
mountain
is
bran
her
brother
coming
into
shoal
water
for
no
ship
can
contain
him
the
ridge
is
his
nose
the
lakes
his
two
eyes
the
king
of
ireland
and
his
lords
at
once
took
counsel
together
how
they
might
meet
this
danger
and
the
plan
they
agreed
upon
was
as
follows
a
huge
hall
should
be
built
big
enough
to
hold
it
was
hoped
would
placate
should
be
a
great
feast
made
there
for
himself
and
his
men
and
matholwch
should
give
over
the
kingdom
of
ireland
to
him
and
do
homage
all
this
was
done
by
branwen
s
advice
but
the
irish
added
a
crafty
device
of
their
own
from
two
brackets
on
each
of
the
hundred
pillars
in
the
hall
should
be
hung
two
leather
bags
with
an
armed
warrior
in
each
of
them
ready
to
fall
upon
the
guests
when
the
moment
should
arrive
evnissyen
however
wandered
into
the
hall
before
the
rest
of
the
host
and
scanning
the
arrangements
with
fierce
and
savage
looks
he
saw
the
bags
which
hung
from
the
pillars
what
is
in
this
bag
said
he
to
one
of
the
irish
meal
good
soul
said
the
irishman
evnissyen
laid
his
hand
on
the
bag
and
felt
about
with
his
fingers
till
he
came
to
the
head
of
the
man
within
it
then
he
squeezed
the
head
till
he
felt
his
fingers
meet
together
in
the
brain
through
the
he
went
to
the
next
bag
and
asked
the
same
question
meal
said
the
irish
attendant
but
evnissyen
crushed
this
warrior
s
head
also
and
thus
he
did
with
all
the
two
hundred
bags
even
in
the
case
of
one
warrior
whose
head
was
covered
with
an
iron
helm
then
the
feasting
began
and
peace
and
concord
reigned
and
matholwch
laid
down
the
sovranty
of
ireland
which
was
conferred
on
the
boy
gwern
and
they
all
fondled
and
caressed
the
fair
child
till
he
came
to
evnissyen
who
suddenly
seized
him
and
flung
him
into
the
blazing
fire
on
the
hearth
branwen
would
have
leaped
after
him
but
bran
held
her
back
then
there
was
arming
apace
and
tumult
and
shouting
and
the
irish
and
british
hosts
closed
in
battle
and
fought
until
the
fall
of
night
of
but
at
night
the
irish
heated
the
magic
cauldron
and
threw
into
it
the
bodies
of
their
dead
who
came
out
next
day
as
good
as
ever
but
dumb
when
evnissyen
saw
this
he
was
smitten
with
remorse
for
having
brought
the
men
of
britain
into
such
a
strait
evil
betide
me
if
i
find
not
a
deliverance
so
he
hid
himself
among
the
irish
dead
and
was
flung
into
the
cauldron
with
the
rest
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
when
he
stretched
himself
out
so
that
he
rent
the
cauldron
into
four
pieces
and
his
own
heart
burst
with
the
effort
and
he
died
wonderful
in
the
end
all
the
irishmen
were
slain
and
all
but
seven
of
the
british
besides
bran
who
was
wounded
in
the
foot
with
a
poisoned
arrow
among
the
seven
were
pryderi
and
manawyddan
bran
then
commanded
them
to
cut
off
his
head
and
take
it
with
you
he
said
to
london
and
there
bury
it
in
the
white
mount
looking
towards
france
and
no
foreigner
shall
invade
the
land
while
it
is
there
on
the
way
the
head
will
talk
to
you
and
be
as
pleasant
company
as
ever
in
life
in
harlech
ye
will
be
feasting
seven
years
and
the
birds
of
rhiannon
will
sing
to
you
and
at
gwales
in
penvro
ye
will
be
feasting
fourscore
years
and
the
head
will
talk
to
you
and
be
uncorrupted
till
ye
open
the
door
looking
towards
cornwall
after
that
ye
may
no
longer
tarry
but
set
forth
to
london
and
bury
the
then
the
seven
cut
off
the
head
of
bran
and
went
forth
and
branwen
with
them
to
do
his
bidding
but
when
branwen
came
to
land
at
aber
alaw
she
cried
woe
is
me
that
i
was
ever
born
two
islands
have
been
destroyed
because
of
and
she
uttered
a
loud
groan
and
her
heart
broke
they
made
her
a
grave
on
the
banks
of
the
alaw
and
the
place
was
called
to
this
day
the
seven
found
that
in
the
absence
of
bran
caswallan
son
of
beli
had
conquered
britain
and
slain
the
six
captains
of
caradawc
by
magic
art
he
had
thrown
on
caradawc
the
veil
of
illusion
and
caradawc
saw
only
the
sword
which
slew
and
slew
but
not
him
who
wielded
it
and
his
heart
broke
for
grief
at
the
sight
they
then
went
to
harlech
and
remained
there
seven
years
listening
to
the
singing
of
the
birds
of
all
the
songs
they
had
ever
heard
were
unpleasant
compared
then
they
went
to
gwales
in
penvro
and
found
a
fair
and
spacious
hall
overlooking
the
ocean
when
they
entered
it
they
forgot
all
the
sorrow
of
the
past
and
all
that
had
befallen
them
and
remained
there
fourscore
years
in
joy
and
mirth
the
wondrous
head
talking
to
them
as
if
it
were
alive
and
bards
call
this
the
entertaining
of
the
noble
three
doors
were
in
the
hall
and
one
of
them
which
looked
to
cornwall
and
to
aber
henvelyn
was
closed
but
the
other
two
were
open
at
the
end
of
the
time
heilyn
son
of
gwyn
said
evil
betide
me
if
i
do
not
open
the
door
to
see
if
what
was
said
is
and
he
opened
it
and
at
once
remembrance
and
sorrow
fell
upon
them
and
they
set
forth
at
once
for
london
and
buried
the
head
in
the
white
mount
where
it
remained
until
arthur
dug
it
up
for
he
would
not
have
the
land
defended
but
by
the
strong
arm
and
this
was
the
third
fatal
disclosure
in
britain
so
ends
this
wild
tale
which
is
evidently
full
of
mythological
elements
the
key
to
which
has
long
been
lost
the
touches
of
northern
ferocity
which
occur
in
it
have
made
some
critics
suspect
the
influence
of
norse
or
icelandic
literature
in
giving
it
its
present
form
the
character
of
evnissyen
would
certainly
lend
countenance
to
this
conjecture
the
typical
of
course
occurs
in
purely
celtic
sagas
but
not
commonly
in
combination
with
the
heroic
strain
shown
in
evnissyen
s
end
nor
does
the
irish
ascend
to
anything
like
the
same
height
of
daimonic
malignity
tale
of
pryderi
and
after
the
events
of
the
previous
tales
pryderi
and
manawyddan
retired
to
the
dominions
of
the
former
and
manawyddan
took
to
wife
rhiannon
the
mother
of
his
friend
there
they
lived
happily
and
prosperously
till
one
day
while
they
were
at
the
gorsedd
or
mound
near
narberth
a
peal
of
thunder
was
heard
and
a
thick
mist
fell
so
that
nothing
could
be
seen
all
round
when
the
mist
cleared
away
behold
the
land
was
bare
before
houses
nor
people
nor
cattle
nor
crops
were
to
be
seen
but
all
was
desert
and
uninhabited
the
palace
of
narberth
was
still
standing
but
it
was
empty
and
remained
except
pryderi
and
manawyddan
and
their
wives
kicva
and
rhiannon
two
years
they
lived
on
the
provisions
they
had
and
on
the
prey
they
killed
and
on
wild
honey
and
then
they
began
to
be
weary
let
us
go
into
lloegyr
then
said
manawyddan
and
seek
out
some
craft
to
support
so
they
went
to
hereford
and
settled
there
and
manawyddan
and
pryderi
began
to
make
saddles
and
housings
and
manawyddan
decorated
them
with
blue
enamel
as
he
had
learned
from
a
great
craftsman
llasar
llaesgywydd
after
a
time
however
the
other
saddlers
of
hereford
finding
that
no
man
would
purchase
any
but
the
work
of
manawyddan
conspired
to
kill
them
and
pryderi
would
have
fought
with
them
but
manawyddan
held
it
better
to
withdraw
elsewhere
and
so
they
did
they
settled
then
in
another
city
where
they
made
shields
such
as
never
were
seen
and
here
too
in
the
end
the
rival
craftsmen
drove
them
out
and
this
happened
also
in
another
town
where
they
made
shoes
and
at
last
they
resolved
to
go
back
to
dyfed
then
they
gathered
their
dogs
about
them
and
lived
by
hunting
as
before
one
day
they
started
a
wild
white
boar
and
chased
him
in
vain
until
he
led
them
up
to
a
vast
and
lofty
castle
all
newly
built
in
a
place
where
they
had
never
seen
a
building
before
the
boar
ran
into
the
castle
the
dogs
followed
him
and
pryderi
against
the
counsel
of
manawyddan
who
knew
there
was
magic
afoot
went
in
to
seek
for
the
dogs
he
found
in
the
centre
of
the
court
a
marble
fountain
beside
which
stood
a
golden
bowl
on
a
marble
slab
and
being
struck
by
the
rich
workmanship
of
the
bowl
he
laid
hold
of
it
to
examine
it
when
he
could
neither
withdraw
his
hand
nor
utter
a
single
sound
but
he
remained
there
transfixed
and
dumb
beside
the
fountain
manawyddan
went
back
to
narberth
and
told
the
story
to
rhiannon
an
evil
companion
hast
thou
been
said
she
and
a
good
companion
hast
thou
next
day
she
went
herself
to
explore
the
castle
she
found
pryderi
still
clinging
to
the
bowl
and
unable
to
speak
she
also
then
laid
hold
of
the
bowl
when
the
same
fate
befell
her
and
immediately
afterwards
came
a
peal
of
thunder
and
a
heavy
mist
fell
and
when
it
cleared
off
the
castle
had
vanished
with
all
that
it
contained
including
the
two
wanderers
manawyddan
then
went
back
to
narberth
where
only
kicva
pryderi
s
wife
now
remained
and
when
she
saw
none
but
herself
and
manawyddan
in
the
place
she
sorrowed
so
that
she
cared
not
whether
she
lived
or
when
manawyddan
saw
this
he
said
to
her
thou
art
in
the
wrong
if
through
fear
of
me
thou
grievest
thus
i
declare
to
thee
were
i
in
the
dawn
of
youth
i
would
keep
my
faith
unto
pryderi
and
unto
thee
also
will
i
keep
heaven
reward
thee
she
said
and
that
is
what
i
deemed
of
and
thereupon
she
took
courage
and
was
glad
kicva
and
manawyddan
then
again
tried
to
support
themselves
by
shoemaking
in
lloegyr
but
the
same
hostility
drove
them
back
to
dyfed
this
time
however
manawyddan
took
back
with
him
a
load
of
wheat
and
he
sowed
it
and
he
prepared
three
crofts
for
a
wheat
crop
thus
the
time
passed
till
the
fields
were
ripe
and
he
looked
at
one
of
the
crofts
and
said
i
will
reap
this
but
on
the
morrow
when
he
went
out
in
the
grey
dawn
he
found
nothing
there
but
bare
ear
had
been
cut
off
from
the
stalk
and
carried
away
next
day
it
was
the
same
with
the
second
croft
but
on
the
following
night
he
armed
himself
and
sat
up
to
watch
the
third
croft
to
see
who
was
plundering
him
at
midnight
as
he
watched
he
heard
a
loud
noise
and
behold
a
mighty
host
of
mice
came
pouring
into
the
croft
and
they
climbed
up
each
on
a
stalk
and
nibbled
off
the
ears
and
made
away
with
them
he
chased
them
in
anger
but
they
fled
far
faster
than
he
could
run
all
save
one
which
was
slower
in
its
movements
and
this
he
barely
managed
to
overtake
and
he
bound
it
into
his
glove
and
took
it
home
to
narberth
and
told
kicva
what
had
happened
he
said
i
will
hang
the
robber
i
have
caught
but
kicva
thought
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
take
vengeance
on
a
mouse
next
day
he
went
up
to
the
mound
of
narberth
and
set
up
two
forks
for
a
gallows
on
the
highest
part
of
the
hill
as
he
was
doing
this
a
poor
scholar
came
towards
him
and
he
was
the
first
person
manawyddan
had
seen
in
dyfed
except
his
own
companions
since
the
enchantment
began
the
scholar
asked
him
what
he
was
about
and
begged
him
to
let
go
the
ill
doth
it
become
a
man
of
thy
rank
to
touch
such
a
reptile
as
i
will
not
let
it
go
by
heaven
said
manawyddan
and
by
that
he
abode
although
the
scholar
offered
him
a
pound
of
money
to
let
it
go
free
i
care
not
said
the
scholar
except
that
i
would
not
see
a
man
of
rank
touching
such
a
reptile
and
with
that
he
went
his
way
as
manawyddan
was
placing
the
on
the
two
forks
of
his
gallows
a
priest
came
towards
him
riding
on
a
horse
with
trappings
and
the
same
conversation
ensued
the
priest
offered
three
pounds
for
the
mouse
s
life
but
manawyddan
refused
to
take
any
price
for
it
willingly
lord
do
thy
good
pleasure
said
the
priest
and
he
too
went
his
way
then
manawyddan
put
a
noose
about
the
mouse
s
neck
and
was
about
to
draw
it
up
when
he
saw
coming
towards
him
a
bishop
with
a
great
retinue
of
and
attendants
and
he
stayed
his
work
and
asked
the
bishop
s
blessing
heaven
s
blessing
be
unto
thee
said
the
bishop
what
work
art
thou
upon
hanging
a
thief
replied
manawyddan
the
bishop
offered
seven
pounds
rather
than
see
a
man
of
thy
rank
destroying
so
vile
a
manawyddan
refused
pounds
was
then
offered
and
then
as
much
again
then
all
the
bishop
s
horses
and
in
vain
since
for
this
thou
wilt
not
said
the
bishop
do
it
at
whatever
price
thou
i
will
do
so
said
manawyddan
i
will
that
rhiannon
and
pryderi
be
that
thou
shalt
have
said
the
pretended
bishop
then
manawyddan
demands
that
the
enchantment
and
illusion
be
taken
off
for
ever
from
the
seven
cantrevs
of
dyfed
and
finally
insists
that
the
bishop
shall
tell
him
who
the
mouse
is
and
why
the
enchantment
was
laid
on
the
country
i
am
llwyd
son
of
kilcoed
replies
the
enchanter
and
the
mouse
is
my
wife
but
that
she
is
pregnant
thou
hadst
never
overtaken
he
goes
on
with
an
explanation
which
takes
us
back
to
the
first
of
the
wedding
of
rhiannon
the
charm
was
cast
on
the
land
to
avenge
the
ill
that
was
done
llwyd
s
friend
gwawl
son
of
clud
with
whom
pryderi
s
father
and
his
knights
had
played
badger
in
the
bag
at
the
court
of
hevydd
hēn
the
mice
were
the
lords
and
ladies
of
llwyd
s
court
the
enchanter
is
then
made
to
promise
that
no
further
vengeance
shall
be
taken
on
pryderi
rhiannon
or
manawyddan
and
the
two
captives
having
been
restored
the
mouse
is
released
then
llwyd
struck
her
with
a
magic
wand
and
she
was
changed
into
a
young
woman
the
fairest
ever
and
on
looking
round
manawyddan
saw
all
the
land
tilled
and
peopled
as
in
its
best
state
and
full
of
herds
and
dwellings
what
bondage
he
asks
has
there
been
upon
pryderi
and
rhiannon
pryderi
has
had
the
knockers
of
the
gate
of
my
palace
about
his
neck
and
rhiannon
has
had
the
collars
of
the
asses
after
they
have
been
carrying
hay
about
her
and
such
had
been
their
bondage
tale
of
māth
son
of
the
previous
tale
was
one
of
magic
and
illusion
in
which
the
mythological
element
is
but
faint
in
that
which
we
have
now
to
consider
we
are
however
in
a
distinctly
mythological
region
the
central
motive
of
the
tale
shows
us
the
powers
of
light
contending
with
those
of
the
for
the
prized
possessions
of
the
latter
in
this
case
a
herd
of
magic
swine
we
are
introduced
in
the
beginning
of
the
story
to
the
deity
māth
of
whom
the
bard
tells
us
that
he
was
unable
to
exist
unless
his
feet
lay
in
the
lap
of
a
maiden
except
when
the
land
was
disturbed
by
war
māth
is
represented
as
lord
of
gwynedd
while
pryderi
rules
over
the
cantrevs
of
the
south
with
māth
were
his
nephews
gwydion
and
gilvaethwy
sons
of
dōn
who
went
the
circuit
of
the
land
in
his
stead
while
māth
lay
with
his
feet
in
the
lap
of
the
fairest
maiden
of
the
land
and
time
goewin
daughter
of
pebin
of
dōl
pebin
in
arvon
and
the
swine
of
gilvaethwy
fell
sick
of
love
for
goewin
and
confided
the
secret
to
his
brother
gwydion
who
undertook
to
help
him
to
his
desire
so
he
went
to
māth
one
day
and
asked
his
leave
to
go
to
pryderi
and
beg
from
him
the
gift
for
māth
of
a
herd
of
swine
which
had
been
bestowed
on
him
by
arawn
king
of
annwn
they
are
beasts
he
said
such
as
never
were
known
in
this
island
before
their
flesh
is
better
than
the
flesh
of
māth
bade
him
go
and
he
and
gilvaethwy
started
with
ten
companions
for
dyfed
they
came
to
pryderi
s
palace
in
the
guise
of
bards
and
gwydion
after
being
entertained
at
a
feast
was
asked
to
tell
a
tale
to
the
court
after
delighting
every
one
with
his
discourse
he
begged
for
a
gift
of
the
swine
but
pryderi
was
under
a
compact
with
his
people
neither
to
sell
nor
give
them
until
they
had
produced
double
their
number
in
the
land
thou
mayest
exchange
them
though
said
gwydion
and
thereupon
he
made
by
magic
arts
an
illusion
of
twelve
horses
magnificently
caparisoned
and
twelve
hounds
and
gave
them
to
pryderi
and
made
off
with
the
swine
as
fast
as
possible
for
said
he
to
his
companions
the
illusion
will
not
last
but
from
one
hour
to
the
same
the
intended
result
came
to
invaded
the
land
to
recover
his
swine
māth
went
to
meet
him
in
arms
and
gilvaethwy
seized
his
opportunity
and
made
goewin
his
wife
although
she
was
unwilling
of
the
war
was
decided
by
a
single
combat
between
gwydion
and
pryderi
and
by
force
of
strength
and
fierceness
and
by
the
magic
and
charms
of
gwydion
pryderi
was
slain
and
at
maen
tyriawc
above
melenryd
was
he
buried
and
there
is
his
penance
of
gwydion
and
when
māth
came
back
he
found
what
gilvaethwy
had
done
and
he
took
goewin
to
be
his
queen
but
gwydion
and
gilvaethwy
went
into
outlawry
and
dwelt
on
the
borders
of
the
land
at
last
they
came
and
submitted
themselves
for
punishment
to
māth
ye
can
not
compensate
me
my
shame
setting
aside
the
death
of
pryderi
he
said
but
since
ye
come
hither
to
be
at
my
will
i
shall
begin
your
punishment
so
he
turned
them
both
into
deer
and
bade
them
come
hither
again
in
a
twelvemonth
they
came
at
the
appointed
time
bringing
with
them
a
young
fawn
and
the
fawn
was
brought
into
human
shape
and
baptized
and
gwydion
and
gilvaethwy
were
changed
into
two
wild
swine
at
the
next
year
s
end
they
came
back
with
a
young
one
who
was
treated
as
the
fawn
before
him
and
the
brothers
were
made
into
wolves
another
year
passed
they
came
back
again
with
a
young
wolf
as
before
and
this
time
their
penance
was
deemed
complete
and
their
human
nature
was
restored
to
them
and
māth
gave
orders
to
have
them
washed
and
anointed
and
nobly
clad
as
was
befitting
children
of
arianrod
the
question
then
arose
of
appointing
another
virgin
and
gwydion
suggests
his
sister
arianrod
she
attends
for
the
purpose
and
māth
asks
her
if
she
is
a
virgin
i
know
not
lord
other
than
that
i
am
she
says
but
she
failed
in
a
magical
test
imposed
by
māth
and
gave
birth
to
two
sons
one
of
these
was
named
dylan
son
of
the
wave
evidently
a
cymric
so
soon
as
he
was
baptized
he
plunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
as
well
as
the
best
fish
that
was
therein
beneath
him
no
wave
ever
a
wild
hangs
about
his
name
in
welsh
legend
on
his
death
which
took
place
it
is
said
at
the
hand
of
his
uncle
govannon
all
the
waves
of
britain
and
ireland
wept
for
him
the
roar
of
the
incoming
tide
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
conway
is
still
called
the
of
llaw
the
other
infant
was
seized
by
gwydion
and
brought
up
under
his
protection
like
other
solar
heroes
he
grew
very
rapidly
when
he
was
four
he
was
as
big
as
if
he
were
eight
and
the
comeliest
youth
that
ever
was
seen
one
day
gwydion
took
him
to
visit
his
mother
arianrod
she
hated
the
children
who
had
exposed
her
false
pretensions
and
upbraided
gwydion
for
bringing
the
boy
into
her
sight
what
is
his
name
she
asked
verily
said
gwydion
he
has
not
yet
a
then
i
lay
this
destiny
upon
him
said
arianrod
that
he
shall
never
have
a
name
till
one
is
given
him
by
on
this
gwydion
went
forth
in
wrath
and
remained
in
his
castle
of
caer
dathyl
that
night
though
the
fact
does
not
appear
in
this
tale
it
must
be
remembered
that
gwydion
is
in
the
older
mythology
the
father
of
arianrod
s
children
llew
got
his
he
was
resolved
to
have
a
name
for
his
son
next
day
he
went
to
the
strand
below
caer
arianrod
bringing
the
boy
with
him
here
he
sat
down
by
the
beach
and
in
his
character
of
a
master
of
magic
he
made
himself
look
like
a
shoemaker
and
the
boy
like
an
apprentice
and
he
began
to
make
shoes
out
of
sedges
and
seaweed
to
which
he
gave
the
semblance
of
cordovan
leather
word
was
brought
to
arianrod
of
the
wonderful
shoes
that
were
being
made
by
a
strange
cobbler
and
she
sent
her
measure
for
a
pair
gwydion
made
them
too
large
she
sent
it
again
and
he
made
them
too
small
then
she
came
herself
to
be
fitted
while
this
was
going
on
a
wren
came
and
lit
on
the
boat
s
mast
and
the
boy
taking
up
a
bow
shot
an
arrow
that
transfixed
the
leg
between
the
sinew
and
the
bone
arianrod
admired
the
brilliant
shot
verily
she
said
with
a
steady
hand
did
the
lion
hit
no
thanks
to
thee
cried
gwydion
now
he
has
got
a
name
llew
llaw
gyffes
shall
he
be
called
we
have
seen
that
the
name
really
means
the
same
thing
as
the
gaelic
lugh
lamfada
lugh
light
of
the
long
arm
so
that
we
have
here
an
instance
of
a
legend
growing
up
round
a
misunderstood
name
inherited
from
a
mythology
llew
took
the
shoes
went
back
immediately
to
sedges
and
seaweed
again
and
arianrod
angry
at
being
tricked
laid
a
new
curse
on
the
boy
he
shall
never
bear
arms
till
i
invest
him
with
but
gwydion
going
to
caer
arianrod
with
the
boy
in
the
semblance
of
two
bards
makes
by
magic
art
the
illusion
of
a
foray
of
armed
men
round
the
castle
arianrod
gives
them
weapons
to
help
in
the
defence
and
thus
again
finds
herself
tricked
by
the
superior
craft
of
gwydion
of
next
she
said
he
shall
never
have
a
wife
of
the
race
that
now
inhabits
this
this
raised
a
difficulty
beyond
the
powers
of
even
gwydion
and
he
went
to
māth
the
supreme
master
of
magic
well
said
māth
we
will
seek
i
and
thou
to
form
a
wife
for
him
out
of
so
they
took
the
blossoms
of
the
oak
and
the
blossoms
of
the
broom
and
the
blossoms
of
the
and
produced
from
them
a
maiden
the
fairest
and
most
graceful
that
man
ever
saw
and
they
baptized
her
and
gave
her
the
name
of
blodeuwedd
or
they
wedded
her
to
llew
and
gave
them
the
cantrev
of
dinodig
to
reign
over
and
there
llew
and
his
bride
dwelt
for
a
season
happy
and
beloved
by
all
of
but
blodeuwedd
was
not
worthy
of
her
beautiful
name
and
origin
one
day
when
llew
was
away
on
a
visit
with
māth
a
lord
named
gronw
pebyr
came
by
the
palace
of
llew
and
blodeuwedd
loved
him
from
the
moment
she
looked
upon
him
that
night
they
slept
together
and
the
next
and
the
next
and
then
they
planned
how
to
be
rid
of
llew
for
ever
but
llew
like
the
gothic
solar
hero
siegfried
is
invulnerable
except
under
special
circumstances
and
blodeuwedd
has
to
learn
from
him
how
he
may
be
slain
this
she
does
under
pretence
of
care
for
his
welfare
the
problem
is
a
hard
one
llew
can
only
be
killed
by
a
spear
which
has
been
a
year
in
making
and
has
only
been
worked
on
during
the
sacrifice
of
the
host
on
sundays
furthermore
he
can
not
be
slain
within
a
house
or
without
on
horseback
or
on
foot
the
only
way
in
fact
is
that
he
should
stand
with
one
foot
on
a
dead
buck
and
the
other
in
a
cauldron
which
is
to
be
used
for
a
bath
and
thatched
with
a
he
is
wounded
while
in
this
position
with
a
spear
made
as
directed
the
wound
may
be
fatal
not
otherwise
after
a
year
during
which
gronw
wrought
at
the
spear
blodeuwedd
begged
llew
to
show
her
more
fully
what
she
must
guard
against
and
he
took
up
the
required
position
to
please
her
gronw
lurking
in
a
wood
hard
by
hurled
the
deadly
spear
and
the
head
which
was
poisoned
sank
into
llew
s
body
but
the
shaft
broke
off
then
llew
changed
into
an
eagle
and
with
a
loud
scream
he
soared
up
into
the
air
and
was
no
more
seen
and
gronw
took
his
castle
and
lands
and
added
them
to
his
own
these
tidings
at
last
reached
gwydion
and
māth
and
gwydion
set
out
to
find
llew
he
came
to
the
house
of
a
vassal
of
his
from
whom
he
learned
that
a
sow
that
he
had
disappeared
every
day
and
could
not
be
traced
but
it
came
home
duly
each
night
gwydion
followed
the
sow
and
it
went
far
away
to
the
brook
since
called
nant
y
llew
where
it
stopped
under
a
tree
and
began
feeding
gwydion
looked
to
see
what
it
ate
and
found
that
it
fed
on
putrid
flesh
that
dropped
from
an
eagle
sitting
aloft
on
the
tree
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
eagle
was
llew
gwydion
sang
to
it
and
brought
it
gradually
down
the
tree
till
it
came
to
his
knee
when
he
struck
it
with
his
magic
wand
and
restored
it
to
the
shape
of
llew
but
worn
to
skin
and
no
one
ever
saw
a
more
piteous
healing
of
when
llew
was
healed
he
and
gwydion
took
vengeance
on
their
foes
blodeuwedd
was
changed
into
an
owl
and
bidden
to
shun
the
light
of
day
and
gronw
was
slain
by
a
cast
of
the
spear
of
llew
that
passed
through
a
slab
of
stone
to
reach
him
and
the
slab
with
the
hole
through
it
made
by
the
spear
of
llew
remains
by
the
bank
of
the
river
cynvael
in
ardudwy
to
this
day
and
llew
took
possession
for
the
second
time
of
his
lands
and
ruled
them
prosperously
all
his
days
the
four
preceding
tales
are
called
the
four
branches
of
the
mabinogi
and
of
the
collection
called
the
mabinogion
they
form
the
most
ancient
and
important
part
dream
of
maxen
following
the
order
of
the
tales
in
the
mabinogion
as
presented
in
nutt
s
edition
we
come
next
to
one
which
is
a
pure
work
of
invention
with
no
mythical
or
legendary
element
at
all
it
recounts
how
maxen
wledig
emperor
of
rome
had
a
vivid
dream
in
which
he
was
led
into
a
strange
country
where
he
saw
a
king
in
an
ivory
chair
carving
chessmen
with
a
steel
file
from
a
rod
of
gold
by
him
on
a
golden
throne
was
the
fairest
of
maidens
he
had
ever
beheld
waking
he
found
himself
in
love
with
the
and
sent
messengers
far
and
wide
to
discover
if
they
could
the
country
and
people
that
had
appeared
to
him
they
were
found
in
britain
thither
went
maxen
and
wooed
and
wedded
the
maiden
in
his
absence
a
usurper
laid
hold
of
his
empire
in
rome
but
with
the
aid
of
his
british
friends
he
reconquered
his
dominions
and
many
of
them
settled
there
with
him
while
others
went
home
to
britain
the
latter
took
with
them
foreign
wives
but
it
is
said
cut
out
their
tongues
lest
they
should
corrupt
the
speech
of
the
britons
thus
early
and
thus
powerful
was
the
devotion
to
their
tongue
of
the
cymry
of
whom
the
mythical
bard
taliesin
prophesied
their
god
they
will
praise
their
speech
they
will
keep
their
land
they
will
lose
except
wild
story
of
lludd
and
this
tale
is
associated
with
the
former
one
in
the
section
entitled
romantic
british
history
it
tells
how
lludd
son
of
beli
and
his
brother
llevelys
ruled
respectively
over
britain
and
france
and
how
lludd
sought
his
brother
s
aid
to
stay
the
three
plagues
that
were
harassing
the
land
these
three
plagues
were
first
the
presence
of
a
demoniac
race
called
the
coranians
secondly
a
fearful
scream
that
was
heard
in
every
home
in
britain
on
every
and
scared
the
people
out
of
their
senses
thirdly
the
unaccountable
disappearance
of
all
provisions
in
the
king
s
court
every
night
so
that
nothing
that
was
not
consumed
by
the
household
could
be
found
the
next
morning
lludd
and
llevelys
talked
over
these
matters
through
a
brazen
tube
for
the
coranians
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
if
once
the
winds
got
hold
of
property
also
attributed
to
māth
son
of
māthonwy
llevelys
destroyed
the
coranians
by
giving
to
lludd
a
quantity
of
poisonous
insects
which
were
to
be
bruised
up
and
scattered
over
the
people
at
an
assembly
these
insects
would
slay
the
coranians
but
the
people
of
britain
would
be
immune
to
them
the
scream
llevelys
explained
as
proceeding
from
two
dragons
which
fought
each
other
once
a
year
they
were
to
be
slain
by
being
intoxicated
with
mead
which
was
to
be
placed
in
a
pit
dug
in
the
very
centre
of
britain
which
was
found
on
measurement
to
be
at
oxford
the
provisions
said
llevelys
were
taken
away
by
a
giant
wizard
for
whom
lludd
watched
as
directed
and
overcame
him
in
combat
and
made
him
his
faithful
vassal
thenceforward
thus
lludd
and
llevelys
freed
the
island
from
its
three
plagues
of
we
next
come
to
five
arthurian
tales
one
of
which
the
tale
of
kilhwch
and
olwen
is
the
only
native
arthurian
legend
which
has
come
down
to
us
in
welsh
literature
the
rest
as
we
have
seen
are
more
or
less
reflections
from
the
arthurian
literature
as
developed
by
foreign
hands
on
the
continent
and
kilhwch
was
son
to
kilydd
and
his
wife
goleuddydd
and
is
said
to
have
been
cousin
to
arthur
his
mother
having
died
kilydd
took
another
wife
and
she
jealous
of
her
stepson
laid
on
him
a
quest
which
promised
to
be
long
and
dangerous
i
declare
she
said
that
it
is
thy
destiny
gael
would
have
said
not
to
be
suited
with
a
wife
till
thou
obtain
olwen
daughter
of
yspaddaden
and
kilhwch
reddened
at
the
name
and
love
of
the
maiden
diffused
itself
through
all
his
by
his
father
s
advice
he
set
out
to
arthur
s
court
to
learn
how
and
where
he
might
find
and
woo
her
a
brilliant
passage
then
describes
the
youth
in
the
flower
of
his
beauty
on
a
noble
steed
caparisoned
with
gold
and
accompanied
by
two
brindled
greyhounds
with
collars
of
rubies
setting
forth
on
his
journey
to
king
arthur
and
the
blade
of
grass
bent
not
beneath
him
so
light
was
his
courser
s
at
arthur
s
after
some
difficulties
with
the
porter
and
with
arthur
s
seneschal
kai
who
did
not
wish
to
admit
the
lad
while
the
company
were
sitting
at
meat
kilhwch
was
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
king
and
declared
his
name
and
his
desire
i
seek
this
boon
he
said
from
thee
and
likewise
at
the
hands
of
thy
warriors
and
he
then
enumerates
an
immense
list
full
of
mythological
personages
and
gwyn
ap
nudd
kai
manawyddan
geraint
and
many
others
including
morvran
son
of
tegid
whom
no
one
struck
at
in
the
battle
of
camlan
by
reason
of
his
ugliness
all
thought
he
was
a
devil
and
sandde
bryd
angel
whom
no
one
touched
with
a
spear
in
the
battle
of
camlan
because
of
his
beauty
all
thought
he
was
a
ministering
the
list
extends
to
many
scores
of
names
and
includes
many
women
as
for
instance
creiddylad
the
daughter
of
lludd
of
the
silver
was
the
most
splendid
maiden
in
the
three
islands
of
the
mighty
and
for
her
gwythyr
the
son
of
greidawl
and
gwyn
the
son

son
kilhwch
adjure
to
obtain
his

however
had
never
heard
of

nor
of

kindred
he
promised
to
seek
for
her
but
at
the
end
of
a
year
no
tidings
of
her
could
be
found
and
kilhwch
declared
that
he
would
depart
and
leave
arthur

and
bedwyr
with
the
guide
kynddelig
are
at
last
bidden
to
go
forth
on
the
quest
of
these
personages
are
very
different
from
those
who
are
called
by
the
same
names
in
malory
or
tennyson
kai
it
is
said
could
go
nine
days
under
water
he
could
render
himself
at
will
as
tall
as
a
forest
tree
so
hot
was
his
physical
constitution
that
nothing
he
bore
in
his
hand
could
get
wetted
in
the
heaviest
rain
very
subtle
was
as
for
later
sir
are
told
that
none
equalled
him
in
swiftness
and
that
though
he
was
a
match
for
any
three
warriors
on
the
field
of
battle
his
lance
made
a
wound
equal
to
those
of
nine
besides
these
three
there
went
also
on
the
quest
gwrhyr
who
knew
all
tongues
and
gwalchmai
son
of
arthur
s
sister
gwyar
and
menw
who
could
make
the
party
invisible
by
magic
spells
the
party
journeyed
till
at
last
they
came
to
a
great
castle
before
which
was
a
flock
of
sheep
kept
by
a
shepherd
who
had
by
him
a
mastiff
big
as
a
horse
the
breath
of
this
shepherd
we
are
told
could
burn
up
a
tree
he
let
no
occasion
pass
without
doing
some
hurt
or
however
he
received
the
party
well
told
them
that
he
was
custennin
brother
of
yspaddaden
whose
castle
stood
before
them
and
brought
them
home
to
his
wife
the
wife
turned
out
to
be
a
sister
of
kilhwch
s
mother
goleuddydd
and
she
was
rejoiced
at
seeing
her
nephew
but
sorrowful
at
the
thought
that
he
had
come
in
search
of
olwen
for
none
ever
returned
from
that
quest
custennin
and
his
family
it
appears
have
suffered
much
at
the
hands
of
their
sons
but
one
being
slain
because
yspaddaden
envied
his
brother
his
share
of
their
patrimony
so
they
associated
themselves
with
the
heroes
in
their
quest
of
the
white
next
day
olwen
came
down
to
the
herdsman
s
house
as
usual
for
she
was
wont
to
wash
her
hair
there
every
saturday
and
each
time
she
did
so
she
left
all
her
rings
in
the
vessel
and
never
sent
for
them
again
she
is
described
in
one
of
those
pictorial
passages
in
which
the
celtic
passion
for
beauty
has
found
such
exquisite
utterance
the
maiden
was
clothed
in
a
robe
of
silk
and
about
her
neck
was
a
collar
of
ruddy
gold
on
which
were
precious
emeralds
and
rubies
more
yellow
was
her
head
than
the
flower
of
the
broom
and
her
skin
was
whiter
than
the
foam
of
the
wave
and
fairer
were
her
hands
and
her
fingers
than
the
blossoms
of
the
amidst
the
spray
of
the
meadow
fountain
the
eye
of
the
trained
hawk
the
glance
of
the
falcon
was
not
brighter
than
hers
her
bosom
was
more
snowy
than
the
breast
of
the
white
swan
her
cheek
was
redder
than
the
reddest
roses
whoso
beheld
her
was
filled
with
her
love
four
white
trefoils
sprang
up
wherever
she
trod
and
therefore
was
she
called
kilhwch
and
she
conversed
together
and
loved
each
other
and
she
bade
him
go
and
ask
her
of
her
father
and
deny
him
nothing
that
he
might
demand
she
had
pledged
her
faith
not
to
wed
without
his
will
for
his
life
would
only
last
till
the
time
of
her
espousals
next
day
the
party
went
to
the
castle
and
saw
yspaddaden
he
put
them
off
with
various
excuses
and
as
they
left
flung
after
them
a
poisoned
dart
bedwyr
caught
it
and
flung
it
back
wounding
him
in
the
knee
and
yspaddaden
cursed
him
in
language
of
extraordinary
vigour
the
words
seem
to
crackle
and
spit
like
flame
thrice
over
this
happened
and
at
last
yspaddaden
declared
what
must
be
done
to
win
olwen
tasks
of
a
long
series
of
tasks
follows
a
vast
hill
is
to
be
ploughed
sown
and
reaped
in
one
day
only
amathaon
son
of
dōn
can
do
it
and
he
will
not
govannon
the
smith
is
to
rid
the
ploughshare
at
each
headland
and
he
will
not
do
it
the
two
dun
oxen
of
gwlwlyd
are
to
draw
the
plough
and
he
will
not
lend
them
honey
nine
times
sweeter
than
that
of
the
bee
must
be
got
to
make
bragget
for
the
wedding
feast
a
magic
cauldron
a
magic
basket
out
of
which
comes
any
meat
that
a
man
desires
a
magic
horn
the
sword
of
gwrnach
the
these
must
be
won
and
many
other
secret
and
difficult
things
some
forty
in
all
before
kilhwch
can
call
olwen
his
own
the
most
difficult
quest
is
that
of
obtaining
the
comb
and
scissors
that
are
between
the
two
ears
of
twrch
trwyth
a
king
transformed
into
a
monstrous
boar
to
hunt
the
boar
a
number
of
other
quests
must
be

of
greid
son
of

to
be
won
and
a
certain
leash
to
hold
him
and
a
certain
collar
for
the
leash
and
a
chain
for
the
collar
and
mabon
son
of
modron
for
the
huntsman
and
the
horse
of
gweddw
to
carry
mabon
and
gwyn
son
of
nudd
to
help
whom
god
placed
over
the
brood
of
devils
in
annwn
he
will
never
be
spared
them
and
so
forth
to
an
extent
which
makes
the
famous
of
the
sons
of
turenn
seem
trifling
by
comparison
difficulties
shalt
thou
meet
with
and
nights
without
sleep
in
seeking
this
bride
price
and
if
thou
obtain
it
not
neither
shalt
thou
have
my
kilhwch
has
one
answer
for
every
demand
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
accomplish
this
although
thou
mayest
think
that
it
will
not
be
easy
and
i
shall
gain
thy
daughter
and
thou
shalt
lose
thy
so
they
depart
on
their
way
to
fulfil
the
tasks
and
on
their
way
home
they
fall
in
with
gwrnach
the
giant
whose
sword
kai
pretending
to
be
a
obtains
by
a
stratagem
on
reaching
arthur
s
court
again
and
telling
the
king
what
they
have
to
do
he
promises
his
aid
first
of
the
marvels
they
accomplished
was
the
discovery
and
liberation
of
mabon
son
of
modron
who
was
taken
from
his
mother
when
three
nights
old
and
it
is
not
known
where
he
is
now
nor
whether
he
is
living
or
gwrhyr
inquires
of
him
from
the
ousel
of
cilgwri
who
is
so
old
that
a
smith
s
anvil
on
which
he
was
wont
to
peck
has
been
worn
to
the
size
of
a
nut
yet
he
has
never
heard
of
mabon
but
he
takes
them
to
a
beast
older
still
the
stag
of
redynvre
and
so
on
to
the
owl
of
cwm
cawlwyd
and
the
eagle
of
gwern
abwy
and
the
salmon
of
llyn
llyw
the
oldest
of
living
things
and
at
last
they
find
mabon
imprisoned
in
the
stone
dungeon
of
gloucester
and
with
arthur
s
help
they
release
him
and
so
the
second
task
is
fulfilled
in
one
way
or
another
by
stratagem
or
valour
or
magic
art
every
achievement
is
accomplished
including
the
last
and
most
perilous
one
that
of
obtaining
the
blood
of
the
black
witch
orddu
daughter
of
the
white
witch
orwen
of
penn
nart
govid
on
the
confines
of
the
combat
here
is
very
like
that
of
finn
in
the
cave
of
keshcorran
but
arthur
at
last
cleaves
the
hag
in
twain
and
kaw
of
north
britain
takes
her
blood
so
then
they
set
forth
for
the
castle
of
yspaddaden
again
and
he
acknowledges
defeat
goreu
son
of
custennin
cuts
off
his
head
and
that
night
olwen
became
the
happy
bride
of
kilhwch
and
the
hosts
of
arthur
dispersed
every
man
to
his
own
land
dream
of
rhonabwy
was
a
under
madawc
son
of
maredudd
whose
brother
iorwerth
rose
in
rebellion
against
him
and
rhonabwy
went
with
the
troops
of
madawc
to
put
him
down
going
with
a
few
companions
into
a
mean
hut
to
rest
for
the
night
he
lies
down
to
sleep
on
a
yellow
by
the
fire
while
his
friends
lie
on
filthy
couches
of
straw
and
twigs
on
the
he
has
a
wonderful
dream
he
sees
before
him
the
court
and
camp
of
the

neither
the
legendary
deity
of
the
former
tale
nor
the
arthur
of
the
french
chivalrous
he
moves
towards
mount
badon
for
his
great
battle
with
the
heathen
a
character
named
iddawc

his
guide
to
the

smiles
at
rhonabwy
and
his

asks
where
iddawc
didst
thou
find
these
little
men
i
found
them
lord
up
yonder
on
the
it
pitieth
me
said
arthur
that
men
of
such
stature
as
these
should
have
the
island
in
their
keeping
after
the
men
that
guarded
it
of
rhonabwy
has
his
attention
directed
to
a
stone
in
the
king
s
ring
it
is
one
of
the
properties
of
that
stone
to
enable
thee
to
remember
that
which
thou
seest
here
and
hadst
thou
not
seen
the
stone
thou
wouldst
never
have
been
able
to
remember
aught
the
different
heroes
and
companions
that
compose
arthur
s
army
are
minutely
described
with
all
the
brilliant
colour
and
delicate
detail
so
beloved
by
the
celtic
fabulist
the
chief
incident
narrated
is
a
game
of
chess
that
takes
place
between
arthur
and
the
knight
owain
son
of
urien
while
the
game
goes
on
first
the
knights
of
arthur
harry
and
disturb
the
ravens
of
owain
but
arthur
when
owain
complains
only
says
play
thy
afterwards
the
ravens
have
the
better
of
it
and
it
is
owain
s
turn
to
bid
arthur
attend
to
his
game
then
arthur
took
the
golden
chessmen
and
crushed
them
to
dust
in
his
hand
and
besought
owain
to
quiet
his
ravens
which
was
done
and
peace
reigned
again
rhonabwy
it
is
said
slept
three
days
and
nights
on
the
before
awaking
from
his
wondrous
dream
an
epilogue
declares
that
no
bard
is
expected
to
know
this
tale
by
heart
and
without
a
book
because
of
the
various
colours
that
were
upon
the
horses
and
the
many
wondrous
colours
of
the
arms
and
of
the
panoply
and
of
the
precious
scarfs
and
of
the
the
dream
of
rhonabwy
is
rather
a
gorgeous
vision
of
the
past
than
a
story
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
lady
of
the
we
have
here
a
welsh
reproduction
of
the
entitled
le
chevalier
au
lion
of
chrestien
de
troyes
the
principal
personage
in
the
tale
is
owain
son
of
urien
who
appears
in
a
character
as
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
celtic
legend
as
it
was
familiar
on
the
continent
that
of
adventure
of
we
are
told
in
the
introduction
that
kymon
a
knight
of
arthur
s
court
had
a
strange
and
unfortunate
adventure
riding
forth
in
search
of
some
deed
of
chivalry
to
do
he
came
to
a
splendid
castle
where
he
was
hospitably
received
by
damsels
of
whom
the
least
lovely
was
more
lovely
than
gwenhwyvar
the
wife
of
arthur
when
she
has
appeared
loveliest
at
the
offering
on
the
day
of
the
nativity
or
at
the
feast
of
with
them
was
a
noble
lord
who
after
kymon
had
eaten
asked
of
his
business
kymon
explained
that
he
was
seeking
for
his
match
in
combat
the
lord
of
the
castle
smiled
and
bade
him
proceed
as
follows
he
should
take
the
road
up
the
valley
and
through
a
forest
till
he
came
to
a
glade
with
a
mound
in
the
midst
of
it
on
the
mound
he
would
see
a
black
man
of
huge
stature
with
one
foot
and
one
eye
bearing
a
mighty
iron
club
he
was
of
that
forest
and
would
have
thousands
of
wild
animals
stags
serpents
and
what
not
feeding
around
him
he
would
show
kymon
what
he
was
in
quest
of
kymon
followed
the
instructions
and
the
black
man
directed
him
to
where
he
should
find
a
fountain
under
a
great
tree
by
the
side
of
it
would
be
a
silver
bowl
on
a
slab
of
marble
kymon
was
to
take
the
bowl
and
throw
a
bowlful
of
water
on
the
slab
when
a
terrific
storm
of
hail
and
thunder
would
there
would
break
forth
an
enchanting
music
of
singing
would
appear
a
knight
in
black
armour
riding
on
a
horse
with
a
black
pennon
upon
his
lance
and
if
thou
dost
not
find
trouble
in
that
adventure
thou
needst
not
seek
it
during
the
rest
of
thy
character
of
welsh
here
let
us
pause
for
a
moment
to
point
out
how
clearly
we
are
in
the
region
of
mediæval
romance
and
how
far
from
that
of
celtic
mythology
perhaps
the
celtic
land
of
youth
may
have
remotely
suggested
those
regions
of
beauty
and
mystery
into
which
the
arthurian
knight
rides
in
quest
of
adventure
but
the
scenery
the
motives
the
incidents
are
altogether
different
and
how
beautiful
they
steeped
in
the
magic
light
of
romance
the
colours
live
and
glow
the
forest
murmurs
in
our
ears
the
breath
of
that
springtime
of
our
modern
world
is
about
us
as
we
follow
the
lonely
rider
down
the
grassy
track
into
an
unknown
world
of
peril
and
delight
while
in
some
respects
the
continental
tales
are
greater
than
the
welsh
more
thoughtful
more
profound
they
do
not
approach
them
in
the
exquisite
artistry
with
which
the
exterior
aspect
of
things
is
rendered
the
atmosphere
of
enchantment
maintained
and
the
reader
led
with
interest
from
point
to
point
in
the
development
of
the
tale
nor
are
these
welsh
tales
a
whit
behind
in
the
noble
and
chivalrous
spirit
which
breathes
through
them
a
finer
school
of
character
and
of
manners
could
hardly
be
found
in
literature
how
strange
that
for
many
centuries
this
treasure
beyond
all
price
should
have
lain
unnoticed
in
our
midst
and
how
deep
must
be
our
gratitude
to
the
nameless
bards
whose
thought
created
it
and
to
the
nobly
inspired
hand
which
first
made
it
a
possession
for
all
the
world
of
but
to
resume
our
story
kymon
did
as
he
was
bidden
the
black
knight
appeared
silently
they
set
lance
in
rest
and
charged
kymon
was
flung
to
earth
while
his
enemy
not
bestowing
one
glance
upon
him
passed
the
shaft
of
his
lance
through
the
rein
of
kymon
s
horse
and
rode
off
with
it
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
kymon
went
back
afoot
to
the
castle
where
none
asked
him
how
he
had
sped
but
they
gave
him
a
new
horse
a
dark
bay
palfrey
with
nostrils
as
red
as
scarlet
on
which
he
rode
home
to
caerleon
and
the
black
owain
was
of
course
fired
by
the
tale
of
kymon
and
next
morning
at
the
dawn
of
day
he
rode
forth
to
seek
for
the
same
adventure
all
passed
as
it
had
done
in
kymon
s
case
but
owain
wounded
the
black
knight
so
sorely
that
he
turned
his
horse
and
fled
owain
pursuing
him
hotly
they
came
to
a
vast
and
resplendent
across
the
drawbridge
they
rode
the
outer
portcullis
of
which
fell
as
the
black
knight
passed
it
but
so
close
at
his
heels
was
owain
that
the
portcullis
fell
behind
him
cutting
his
horse
in
two
behind
the
saddle
and
he
himself
remained
imprisoned
between
the
outer
gate
of
the
drawbridge
and
the
inner
while
he
was
in
this
predicament
a
maiden
came
to
him
and
gave
him
a
ring
when
he
wore
it
with
the
stone
reversed
and
clenched
in
his
hand

would
become
invisible
and
when
the
servants
of
the
lord
of
the
castle
came
for
him
he
was
to
elude
them
and
follow
her
this
she
did
knowing
apparently
who
he
was
for
as
a
friend
thou
art
the
most
sincere
and
as
a
lover
the
most
owain
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
the
maiden
concealed
him
in
that
night
a
great
lamentation
was
heard
in
the
lord
had
died
of
the
wound
which
owain
had
given
him
soon
afterwards
owain
got
sight
of
the
mistress
of
the
castle
and
love
of
her
took
entire
possession
of
him
luned
the
maiden
who
had
rescued
him
wooed
her
for
him
and
he
became
her
husband
and
lord
of
the
castle
of
the
fountain
and
all
the
dominions
of
the
black
knight
and
he
then
defended
the
fountain
with
lance
and
sword
as
his
forerunner
had
done
and
made
his
defeated
antagonists
ransom
themselves
for
great
sums
which
he
bestowed
among
his
barons
and
knights
thus
he
abode
for
three
years

for
after
this
time
arthur
with
his
nephew
gwalchmai
and
with
kymon
for
guide
rode
forth
at
the
head
of
a
host
to
search
for
tidings
of
owain
they
came
to
the
fountain
and
here
they
met
owain
neither
knowing
the
other
as
their
helms
were
down
and
first
kai
was
overthrown
and
then
gwalchmai
and
owain
fought
and
after
a
while
gwalchmai
was
unhelmed
owain
said
my
lord
gwalchmai
i
did
not
know
thee
take
my
sword
and
my
said
gwalchmai
thou
owain
art
the
victor
take
thou
my
arthur
ended
the
contention
in
courtesy
by
taking
the
swords
of
both
and
then
they
all
rode
to
the
castle
of
the
fountain
where
owain
entertained
them
with
great
joy
and
he
went
back
with
arthur
to
caerleon
promising
to
his
countess
that
he
would
remain
there
but
three
months
and
then
return
forgets
his
but
at
the
court
of
arthur
he
forgot
his
love
and
his
duty
and
remained
there
three
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
noble
lady
came
riding
upon
a
horse
caparisoned
with
gold
and
she
sought
out
owain
and
took
the
ring
from
his
hand
thus
she
said
shall
be
treated
the
deceiver
the
traitor
the
faithless
the
disgraced
and
the
then
she
turned
her
horse
s
head
and
departed
and
owain
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
remorse
fled
from
the
sight
of
men
and
lived
in
a
desolate
country
with
wild
beasts
till
his
body
wasted
and
his
hair
grew
long
and
his
clothing
rotted
away
and
the
in
this
guise
when
near
to
death
from
exposure
and
want
he
was
taken
in
by
a
certain
widowed
countess
and
her
maidens
and
restored
to
strength
by
magic
balsams
and
although
they
besought
him
to
remain
with
them
he
rode
forth
again
seeking
for
lonely
and
desert
lands
here
he
found
a
lion
in
battle
with
a
great
serpent
owain
slew
the
serpent
and
the
lion
followed
him
and
played
about
him
as
if
it
had
been
a
greyhound
that
he
had
reared
and
it
fed
him
by
catching
deer
part
of
which
owain
cooked
for
himself
giving
the
rest
to
his
lion
to
devour
and
the
beast
kept
watch
over
him
by
night
of
owain
next
finds
an
imprisoned
damsel
whose
sighs
he
hears
though
he
can
not
see
her
nor
she
him
being
questioned
she
told
him
that
her
name
was
was
the
handmaid
of
a
countess
whose
husband
had
left
her
and
he
was
the
friend
i
loved
best
in
the
two
of
the
pages
of
the
countess
had
traduced
him
and
because
she
defended
him
she
was
condemned
to
be
burned
if
before
a
year
was
out
he
namely
owain
son
of
urien
had
not
appeared
to
deliver
her
and
the
year
would
end
on
the
next
day
owain
met
the
two
youths
leading
luned
to
execution
and
did
battle
with
them
with
the
help
of
the
lion
he
overcame
them
rescued
luned
and
returned
to
the
castle
of
the
fountain
where
he
was
reconciled
with
his
love
and
he
took
her
with
him
to
arthur
s
court
and
she
was
his
wife
there
as
long
as
she
lived
lastly
comes
an
adventure
in
which
still
aided
by
the
lion
he
vanquishes
a
black
giant
and
releases
noble
ladies
and
the
giant
vows
to
give
up
his
evil
ways
and
keep
a
hospice
for
wayfarers
as
long
as
he
should
live
and
thenceforth
owain
dwelt
at
arthur
s
court
greatly
beloved
as
the
head
of
his
household
until
he
went
away
with
his
followers
and
these
were
the
army
of
three
hundred
ravens
which
kenverchyn
had
left
him
and
wherever
owain
went
with
these
he
was
victorious
and
this
is
the
tale
of
the
lady
of
the
tale
of
enid
and
in
this
tale
which
appears
to
be
based
on
the
erec
of
chrestien
de
troyes
the
main
interest
is
neither
mythological
nor
adventurous
but
sentimental
how
geraint
found
and
wooed
his
love
as
the
daughter
of
a
great
lord
fallen
on
evil
days
how
he
jousted
for
her
with
edeyrn
son
of
cymric
deity
transformed
into
the
knight
of
the
sparrowhawk
how
lapped
in
love
of
her
he
grew
careless
of
his
fame
and
his
duty
how
he
misunderstood
the
words
she
murmured
over
him
as
she
deemed
him
sleeping
and
doubted
her
faith
how
despitefully
he
treated
her
and
in
how
many
a
bitter
test
she
proved
her
love
and
these
things
have
been
made
so
familiar
to
english
readers
in
tennyson
s
enid
that
they
need
not
detain
us
here
tennyson
in
this
instance
has
followed
his
original
very
closely
legends
of
the
grail
the
tale
of
peredur
the
tale
of
peredur
is
one
of
great
interest
and
significance
in
connexion
with
the
origin
of
the
grail
legend
peredur
corresponds
to
the
perceval
of
chrestien
de
troyes
to
whom
we
owe
the
earliest
extant
poem
on
the
grail
but
that
writer
left
his
grail
story
unfinished
and
we
never
learn
from
him
what
exactly
the
grail
was
or
what
gave
it
its
importance
when
we
turn
for
light
to
peredur
which
undoubtedly
represents
a
more
ancient
form
of
the
legend
we
find
ourselves
baffled
for
peredur
may
be
described
as
the
grail
story
without
the
grail
the
strange
personages
objects
and
incidents
which
form
the
usual
setting
for
the
entry
upon
the
scene
of
this
mystic
treasure
are
all
here
we
breathe
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
grail
castle
but
of
the
grail
itself
there
is
no
word
the
story
is
concerned
simply
with
the
vengeance
taken
by
the
hero
for
the
slaying
of
a
kinsman
and
for
this
end
only
are
the
mysteries
of
the
castle
of
wonders
displayed
to
him
we
learn
at
the
opening
of
the
tale
that
peredur
was
in
the
significant
position
of
being
a
seventh
son
to
be
a
seventh
son
was
in
this
world
of
mystical
romance
equivalent
to
being
marked
out
by
destiny
for
fortunes
high
and
strange
his
father
evrawc
an
earl
of
the
north
and
his
six
brothers
had
fallen
in
fight
peredur
s
mother
therefore
fearing
a
similar
fate
for
her
youngest
child
brought
him
up
in
a
forest
keeping
from
him
all
knowledge
of
chivalry
or
warfare
and
of
such
things
as
or
weapons
here
he
grew
up
a
simple
rustic
in
manner
and
in
knowledge
but
of
an
amazing
bodily
strength
and
activity
goes
forth
in
quest
of
one
day
he
saw
three
knights
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
they
were
all
of
arthur
s
geneir
and
owain
entranced
by
the
sight
he
asked
his
mother
what
these
beings
were
they
are
angels
my
son
said
she
by
my
faith
said
peredur
i
will
go
and
become
an
angel
with
he
goes
to
meet
them
and
soon
learns
what
they
are
owain
courteously
explains
to
him
the
use
of
a
saddle
a
shield
a
sword
all
the
accoutrements
of
warfare
and
peredur
that
evening
picked
out
a
bony
piebald
and
dressed
him
up
in
a
saddle
and
trappings
made
of
twigs
and
imitated
from
those
he
had
seen
seeing
that
he
was
bent
on
going
forth
to
deeds
of
chivalry
his
mother
gave
him
her
blessing
and
sundry
instructions
and
bade
him
seek
the
court
of
arthur
there
there
are
the
best
and
the
boldest
and
the
most
beautiful
of
first
feat
of
peredur
mounted
his
rosinante
took
for
weapons
a
handful
of
stakes
and
rode
forth
to
arthur
s
court
here
the
steward
kai
rudely
repulsed
him
for
his
rustic
appearance
but
a
dwarf
and
dwarfess
who
had
been
a
year
at
the
court
without
speaking
one
word
to
any
one
there
cried
goodly
peredur
son
of
evrawc
the
welcome
of
heaven
be
unto
thee
flower
of
knights
and
light
of
kai
chastised
the
dwarfs
for
breaking
silence
by
lauding
such
a
fellow
as
peredur
and
when
the
latter
demanded
to
be
brought
to
arthur
bade
him
first
go
and
overcome
a
stranger
knight
who
had
just
challenged
the
whole
court
by
throwing
a
goblet
of
wine
into
the
face
of
gwenhwyvar
and
whom
all
shrank
from
meeting
peredur
went
out
promptly
to
where
the
ruffian
knight
was
swaggering
up
and
down
awaiting
an
opponent
and
in
the
combat
that
ensued
pierced
his
skull
with
one
of
his
sharp
stakes
and
slew
him
owain
then
came
out
and
found
peredur
dragging
his
fallen
enemy
about
what
art
thou
doing
there
said
owain
this
iron
coat
said
peredur
will
never
come
off
from
him
not
by
my
efforts
at
any
so
owain
showed
him
how
to
unfasten
the
armour
and
peredur
took
it
and
the
knight
s
weapons
and
horse
and
rode
forth
to
seek
what
further
adventures
might
befall
here
we
have
the
character
of
reine
the
valiant
and
simpleton
clearly
and
vividly
drawn
peredur
on
leaving
arthur
s
court
had
many
encounters
in
which
he
triumphed
with
ease
sending
the
beaten
knights
to
with
the
message
that
he
had
overthrown
them
for
the
honour
of
arthur
and
in
his
service
but
that
he
peredur
would
never
come
to
the
court
again
till
he
had
avenged
the
insult
to
the
dwarfs
upon
kai
who
was
accordingly
reproved
by
arthur
and
was
greatly
grieved
thereat
castle
of
we
now
come
into
what
the
reader
will
immediately
recognise
as
the
atmosphere
of
the
grail
legend
peredur
came
to
a
castle
beside
a
lake
where
he
found
a
venerable
man
with
attendants
about
him
who
were
fishing
in
the
lake
as
peredur
approached
the
aged
man
rose
and
went
into
the
castle
and
peredur
saw
that
he
was
lame
peredur
entered
and
was
hospitably
received
in
a
great
hall
the
aged
man
asked
him
when
they
had
done
their
meal
if
he
knew
how
to
fight
with
the
sword
and
promised
to
teach
him
all
knightly
accomplishments
and
the
manners
and
customs
of
different
countries
and
courtesy
and
gentleness
and
noble
and
he
added
i
am
thy
uncle
thy
mother
s
finally
he
bade
him
ride
forth
and
remember
whatever
he
saw
that
might
cause
him
wonder
not
to
ask
the
meaning
of
it
if
no
one
had
the
courtesy
to
inform
him
this
is
the
test
of
obedience
and
on
which
the
rest
of
the
adventure
turns
on
next
riding
forth
peredur
came
to
a
vast
desert
wood
beyond
which
he
found
a
great
castle
the
castle
of
wonders
he
entered
it
by
the
open
door
and
found
a
stately
man
sitting
in
a
great
hall
with
many
pages
about
him
who
received
peredur
honourably
at
meat
peredur
sat
beside
the
lord
of
the
castle
who
asked
him
when
they
had
done
if
he
could
fight
with
a
sword
were
i
to
receive
instruction
said
peredur
i
think
i
the
lord
then
gave
peredur
a
sword
and
bade
him
strike
at
a
great
iron
staple
that
was
in
the
floor
peredur
did
so
and
cut
the
staple
in
two
but
the
sword
also
flew
into
two
parts
place
the
two
parts
together
said
the
lord
peredur
did
so
and
they
became
one
again
both
sword
and
staple
a
second
time
this
was
done
with
the
same
result
the
third
time
neither
sword
nor
staple
would
reunite
thou
hast
arrived
said
the
lord
at
of
thy
he
then
declared
that
he
also
was
peredur
s
uncle
and
brother
to
the
with
whom
peredur
had
lodged
on
the
previous
night
as
they
discoursed
two
youths
entered
the
hall
bearing
a
spear
of
mighty
size
from
the
point
of
which
three
streams
of
blood
dropped
upon
the
ground
and
all
the
company
when
they
saw
this
began
wailing
and
lamenting
with
a
great
outcry
but
the
lord
took
no
notice
and
did
not
break
off
his
discourse
with
peredur
next
there
came
in
two
maidens
carrying
between
them
a
large
salver
on
which
amid
a
profusion
of
blood
lay
a
man
s
head
thereupon
the
wailing
and
lamenting
began
even
more
loudly
than
before
but
at
last
they
fell
silent
and
peredur
was
led
off
to
his
chamber
mindful
of
the
injunction
of
the
he
had
shown
no
surprise
at
what
he
saw
nor
had
he
asked
the
meaning
of
it
he
then
rode
forth
again
in
quest
of
other
adventures
which
he
had
in
bewildering
abundance
and
which
have
no
particular
relation
to
the
main
theme
the
mystery
of
the
castle
is
not
revealed
till
the
last
pages
of
the
story
the
head
in
the
silver
dish
was
that
of
a
cousin
of
peredur
s
the
lance
was
the
weapon
with
which
he
was
slain
and
with
which
also
the
uncle
of
peredur
the
had
been
lamed
peredur
had
been
shown
these
things
to
incite
him
to
avenge
the
wrong
and
to
prove
his
fitness
for
the
task
the
nine
sorceresses
of
gloucester
are
said
to
have
been
those
who
worked
these
evils
on
the
relatives
of
peredur
on
learning
these
matters
peredur
with
the
help
of
arthur
attacked
the
sorceresses
who
were
slain
every
one
and
the
vengeance
was
accomplished
conte
del
the
tale
of
chrestien
de
troyes
called
the
conte
del
graal
or
perceval
le
gallois
launched
the
story
in
european
literature
it
was
written
about
the
year
it
agrees
in
the
introductory
portion
with
peredur
the
hero
being
here
called
perceval
he
is
trained
in
knightly
accomplishments
by
an
aged
knight
named
gonemans
who
warns
him
against
talking
overmuch
and
asking
questions
when
he
comes
to
the
castle
of
wonders
the
objects
brought
into
the
hall
are
a
lance
a
graal
accompanied
by
two
candlesticks
the
light
of
which
is
put
out
by
the
shining
of
the
graal
a
silver
plate
and
sword
the
last
of
which
is
given
to
perceval
the
bleeding
head
of
the
welsh
story
does
not
appear
nor
are
we
told
what
the
graal
was
next
day
when
perceval
rode
forth
he
met
a
maiden
who
upbraided
him
fiercely
for
not
having
asked
the
meaning
of
what
he
he
done
so
the
lame
king
who
is
here
identical
with
the
lord
of
the
castle
of
wonders
would
have
been
made
whole
again
perceval
s
sin
in
quitting
his
mother
against
her
wish
was
the
reason
why
he
was
withholden
from
asking
the
question
which
would
have
broken
the
spell
this
is
a
very
crude
piece
of
invention
for
it
was
manifestly
peredur
s
destiny
to
take
arms
and
achieve
the
adventure
of
the
grail
and
he
committed
no
sin
in
doing
so
later
on
in
the
story
perceval
is
met
by
a
damsel
of
hideous
appearance
who
curses
him
for
his
omission
to
ask
concerning
the
lance
and
the
other
he
done
so
the
king
would
have
been
restored
and
would
have
ruled
his
land
in
peace
but
now
maidens
will
be
put
to
shame
knights
will
be
slain
widows
and
orphans
will
be
made
this
conception
of
the
question
episode
seems
to
me
radically
different
from
that
which
was
adopted
in
the
welsh
version
it
is
characteristic
of
peredur
that
he
always
does
as
he
is
told
by
proper
authority
the
question
was
a
test
of
obedience
and
and
he
succeeded
in
the
ordeal
in
fairy
literature
one
is
often
punished
for
curiosity
but
never
for
discretion
and
reserve
the
welsh
tale
here
preserves
i
think
the
original
form
of
the
story
but
the
french
writers
mistook
the
omission
to
ask
questions
for
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
hero
and
invented
a
shallow
and
incongruous
theory
of
the
episode
and
its
consequences
strange
to
say
however
the
french
view
found
its
way
into
later
versions
of
the
welsh
tale
and
such
a
version
is
that
which
we
have
in
the
peredur
towards
the
end
of
the
story
meets
with
a
hideous
damsel
the
terrors
of
whose
aspect
are
vividly
described
and
who
rebukes
him
violently
for
not
having
asked
the
meaning
of
the
marvels
at
the
castle
hadst
thou
done
so
the
king
would
have
been
restored
to
health
and
his
dominions
to
peace
whereas
from
henceforth
he
will
have
to
endure
battles
and
conflicts
and
his
knights
will
perish
and
wives
will
be
widowed
and
maidens
will
be
left
portionless
and
all
this
is
because
of
i
regard
this
loathly
damsel
as
an
obvious
interpolation
in
the
welsh
tale
she
came
into
it
straight
out
of
the
pages
of
chrestien
that
she
did
not
originally
belong
to
the
story
of
peredur
seems
evident
from
the
fact
that
in
this
tale
the
lame
lord
who
bids
peredur
refrain
from
asking
questions
is
according
to
the
damsel
the
very
person
who
would
have
benefited
by
his
doing
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
peredur
never
does
ask
the
question
and
it
plays
no
part
in
the
conclusion
of
the
story
chrestien
s
unfinished
tale
tells
us
some
further
adventures
of
perceval
and
of
his
friend
and
gauvain
but
never
explains
the
significance
of
the
mysterious
objects
seen
at
the
castle
his
continuators
of
whom
gautier
was
the
first
tell
us
that
the
graal
was
the
cup
of
the
last
supper
and
the
lance
that
which
had
pierced
the
side
of
christ
at
the
crucifixion
and
that
peredur
ultimately
makes
his
way
back
to
the
castle
asks
the
necessary
question
and
succeeds
his
uncle
as
lord
of
the
castle
and
guardian
of
its
treasures
von
in
the
story
as
given
by
wolfram
von
eschenbach
who
wrote
about
the
year
twenty
years
later
than
chrestien
de
troyes
with
whose
work
he
was
meet
with
a
new
and
unique
conception
of
the
grail
he
says
of
the
knights
of
the
grail

was
originally
brought
down
from
heaven
by
a
flight
of
angels
and
deposited
in
anjou
as
the
worthiest
region
for
its
reception
its
power
is
sustained
by
a
dove
which
every
good
friday
comes
from
heaven
and
lays
on
the
grail
a
consecrated
host
it
is
preserved
in
the
castle
of
munsalväsche
montsalvat
and
guarded
by
four
hundred
knights
who
are
all
except
their
king
vowed
to
virginity
the
king
may
marry
and
is
indeed
in
order
to
maintain
the
succession
commanded
to
do
so
by
the
grail
which
conveys
its
messages
to
mankind
by
writing
which
appears
upon
it
and
which
fades
away
when
deciphered
in
the
time
of
parzival
the
king
is
anfortas
he
can
not
die
in
presence
of
the
grail
but
he
suffers
from
a
wound
which
because
he
received
it
in
the
cause
of
worldly
pride
and
in
seeking
after
illicit
love
the
influence
of
the
grail
can
not
heal
until
the
destined
deliverer
shall
break
the
spell
this
parzival
should
have
done
by
asking
the
question
what
aileth

uncle
the
french
version
makes
perceval
fail
in
conceives
the
failure
as
one
in
sympathy
he
fails
at
any
rate
and
next
morning
finds
the
castle
empty
and
his
horse
standing
ready
for
him
at
the
gate
as
he
departs
he
is
mocked
by
servitors
who
appear
at
the
windows
of
the
towers
after
many
adventures
which
are
quite
unlike
those

in
chrestien
s
conte
del

or
in

wolfram
tells
us
that
he
had
the
substance
of
the
tale
from
the
provençal
poet
kyot
or
kyot
der
meister
wol
bekannt
in
his
this
probably
is
a
mere
piece
of
romantic
to
have
found
it
in
an
arabic
book
in
toledo
written
by
a
heathen
named
flegetanis
continuators
of
what
exactly
may
have
been
the
material
before
chrestien
de
troyes
we
can
not
tell
but
his
various
and
continuators
notably
manessier
all
dwell
on
the
christian
character
of
the
objects
shown
to
perceval
in
the
castle
and
the
question
arises
how
did
they
come
to
acquire
this
character
the
welsh
story
certainly
the
most
archaic
form
of
the
legend
shows
that
they
did
not
have
it
from
the
beginning
an
indication
in
one
of
the
french
continuations
to
chrestien
s
conte
may
serve
to
put
us
on
the
track
gautier
the
author
of
this
continuation
tells
us
of
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
gauvain
sir
gawain
to
achieve
the
adventure
of
the
grail
he
partially
succeeds
and
this
has
the
effect
of
restoring
the
lands
about
the
castle
which
were
desert
and
untilled
to
blooming
fertility
the
grail
therefore
besides
its
other
characters

a
talismanic
power
in
promoting
increase
wealth
and
rejuvenation

a
talisman
of
the
character
of
a
cornucopia

and

clings
closely
to
the
grail
in
all
versions
of
the
legend
even
in
the
loftiest
and
most
spiritual
of
these
the
parzival
of
wolfram
von
eschenbach
this
quality
is
very
strongly
marked
a
sick

man
who
looked
on
it

not

within

this

the
name

which
originated
in
the
french
versions
was
supposed
to
be
derived
it
was
the
satisfaction
of
all
desires
in
wolfram
s
poem
the
grail
though
connected
with
the
eucharist
was
as
we
have
seen
a
stone
not
a
cup
it
thus
appears
as
a
relic
of
ancient
it
is
remarkable
that
a
similar
stone
of
abundance
occurs
also
in
the
welsh
peredur
though
not
as
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
castle
it
was
guarded
by
a
black
serpent
which
peredur
slew
and
he
gave
the
stone
to
his
friend
etlyn
celtic
cauldron
of
now
the
reader
has
by
this
time
become
well
acquainted
with
an
object
having
the
character
of
a
talisman
of
abundance
and
rejuvenation
in
celtic
myth
as
the
cauldron
of
the
dagda
it
came
into
ireland
with
the
danaans
from
their
mysterious
in
welsh
legend
bran
the
blessed
got
it
from
ireland
whither
it
returned
again
as
part
of
branwen
s
dowry
in
a
strange
and
mystic
poem
by
taliesin
it
is
represented
as
part
of
the
spoils
of
hades
or
annwn
brought
thence
by
arthur
in
a
tragic
adventure
not
otherwise
recorded
it
is
described
by
taliesin
as
lodged
in
caer
pedryvan
the
castle
of
pwyll
the
fire
that
heated
it
was
fanned
by
the
breath
of
nine
maidens
its
edge
was
rimmed
with
pearls
and
it
would
not
cook
the
food
of
a
coward
or
man
forsworn
am
i
not
a
candidate
for
fame
to
be
heard
in
song
in
caer
pedryvan
four
times
revolving
the
first
word
from
the
cauldron
when
was
it
spoken
by
the
breath
of
nine
maidens
it
was
gently
warmed
is
it
not
the
cauldron
of
the
chief
of
annwn
what
is
its
fashion
a
rim
of
pearls
is
round
its
edge
it
will
not
cook
the
food
of
a
coward
or
one
forsworn
a
sword
flashing
bright
will
be
raised
to
him
and
left
in
the
hand
of
lleminawg
and
before
the
door
of
the
gate
of
uffern
the
lamp
was
burning
when
we
went
with
splendid
except
seven
none
returned
from
caer
vedwyd
more
remotely
still
the
cauldron
represents
the
sun
which
appears
in
the
earliest
myths
as
a
golden
vessel
which
pours
forth
light
and
heat
and
fertility
the
lance
is
the
of
the
thunder
god
indra
appearing
in
norse
mythology
as
the
hammer
of
thor
the
quest
for
these
objects
represents
the
ideas
of
the
restoration
by
some
divine
champion
of
the
wholesome
order
of
the
seasons
disturbed
by
some
temporary
derangement
such
as
those
which
to
this
day
bring
famine
and
desolation
to
india
now
in
the
welsh
peredur
we
have
clearly
an
outline
of
the
original
celtic
tale
but
the
grail
does
not
appear
in
it
we
may
conjecture
however
from
gautier
s
continuation
of
chrestien
s
poem
that
a
talisman
of
abundance
figured
in
early
continental
probably
breton
versions
of
the
legend
in
one
version
at
on
which
wolfram
based
his
parzival
talisman
was
a
stone
but
usually
it
would
have
been
not
a
stone
but
a
cauldron
or
vessel
of
some
kind
endowed
with
the
usual
attributes
of
the
magic
cauldron
of
celtic
myth
this
vessel
was
associated
with
a
lance
here
were
the
suggestive
elements
from
which
some
unknown
singer
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
transformed
the
ancient
tale
of
vengeance
and
redemption
into
the
mystical
romance
which
at
once
took
possession
of
the
heart
and
soul
of
christendom
the
magic
cauldron
became
the
cup
of
the
eucharist
the
lance
was
invested
with
a
more
tremendous
guilt
than
that
of
the
death
of
peredur
s
kinsman
celtic
poetry
german
mysticism
christian
chivalry
and
ideas
of
magic
which
still
cling
to
the
rude
stone
monuments
of
western
these
combined
to
make
the
story
of
the
grail
and
to
endow
it
with
the
strange
attraction
which
has
led
to
its
by
artist
after
artist
for
seven
hundred
years
and
who
even
now
can
say
that
its
course
is
run
at
last
and
the
towers
of
montsalvat
dissolved
into
the
mist
from
which
they
sprang
tale
of
alone
of
the
tales
in
the
collection
called
by
lady
charlotte
guest
the
mabinogion
the
story
of
the
birth
and
adventures
of
the
mythical
bard
taliesin
the
amergin
of
cymric
legend
is
not
found
in
the
manuscript
entitled
the
red
book
of
it
is
taken
from
a
manuscript
of
the
late
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
century
and
never
appears
to
have
enjoyed
much
popularity
in
wales
much
of
the
very
obscure
poetry
attributed
to
taliesin
is
to
be
found
in
it
and
this
is
much
older
than
the
prose
the
object
of
the
tale
indeed
as
nutt
has
pointed
out
in
his
edition
of
the
mabinogion
is
rather
to
provide
a
sort
of
framework
for
stringing
together
scattered
pieces
of
verse
supposed
to
be
the
work
of
taliesin
than
to
tell
a
connected
story
about
him
and
his
doings
the
story
of
the
birth
of
the
hero
is
the
most
interesting
thing
in
the
tale
there
lived
it
was
said
in
the
time
of
arthur
of
the
round
table
a
man
named
tegid
voel
of
penllyn
whose
wife
was
named
ceridwen
they
have
a
son
named
avagddu
who
was
the
most
man
in
the
world
to
compensate
for
his
lack
of
beauty
his
mother
resolved
to
make
him
a
sage
so
according
to
the
art
of
the
books
of
feryllt
she
had
recourse
to
the
great
celtic
source
of
magical
cauldron
she
began
to
boil
a
cauldron
of
inspiration
and
science
for
her
son
that
his
reception
might
be
honourable
because
of
his
knowledge
of
the
mysteries
of
the
future
state
of
the
the
cauldron
might
not
cease
to
boil
for
a
year
and
a
day
and
only
in
three
drops
of
it
were
to
be
found
the
magical
grace
of
the
brew
she
put
gwion
bach
the
son
of
gwreang
of
llanfair
to
stir
the
cauldron
and
a
blind
man
named
morda
to
keep
the
fire
going
and
she
made
incantations
over
it
and
put
in
magical
herbs
from
time
to
time
as
feryllt
s
book
directed
but
one
day
towards
the
end
of
the
year
three
drops
of
the
magic
liquor
flew
out
of
the
cauldron
and
lighted
on
the
finger
of
gwion
like
finn
mac
cumhal
on
a
similar
occasion
he
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
immediately
became
gifted
with
supernatural
insight
he
saw
that
he
had
got
what
was
intended
for
avagddu
and
he
saw
also
that
ceridwen
would
destroy
him
for
it
if
she
could
so
he
fled
to
his
own
land
and
the
cauldron
deprived
of
the
sacred
drops
now
contained
nothing
but
poison
the
power
of
which
burst
the
vessel
and
the
liquor
ran
into
a
stream
hard
by
and
poisoned
the
horses
of
gwyddno
garanhir
which
drank
of
the
water
whence
the
stream
is
called
the
poison
of
the
horses
of
gwyddno
from
that
time
forth
ceridwen
now
came
on
the
scene
and
saw
that
her
year
s
labour
was
lost
in
her
rage
she
smote
morda
with
a
billet
of
firewood
and
struck
out
his
eye
and
she
then
pursued
after
gwion
bach
he
saw
her
and
changed
himself
into
a
hare
she
became
a
greyhound
he
leaped
into
a
river
and
became
a
fish
and
she
chased
him
as
an
otter
he
became
a
bird
and
she
a
hawk
then
he
turned
himself
into
a
grain
of
wheat
and
dropped
among
the
other
grains
on
a
and
she
became
a
black
hen
and
swallowed
him
nine
months
afterwards
she
bore
him
as
an
infant
and
she
would
have
killed
him
but
could
not
on
account
of
his
beauty
so
she
wrapped
him
in
a
leathern
bag
and
cast
him
into
the
sea
to
the
mercy
of
luck
of
now
gwyddno
of
the
poisoned
horses
had
a
salmon
weir
on
the
strand
between
dyvi
and
aberystwyth
and
his
son
elphin
a
needy
and
luckless
lad
one
day
fished
out
the
leathern
bag
as
it
stuck
on
the
weir
they
opened
it
and
found
the
infant
within
behold
a
radiant
brow
said
gwyddno
taliesin
be
he
called
said
elphin
and
they
brought
the
child
home
very
carefully
and
reared
it
as
their
own
and
this
was
taliesin
prime
bard
of
the
cymry
and
the
first
of
the
poems
he
made
was
a
lay
of
praise
to
elphin
and
promise
of
good
fortune
for
the
future
and
this
was
fulfilled
for
elphin
grew
in
riches
and
honour
day
after
day
and
in
love
and
favour
with
king
arthur
but
one
day
as
men
praised
king
arthur
and
all
his
belongings
above
measure
elphin
boasted
that
he
had
a
wife
as
virtuous
as
any
at
arthur
s
court
and
a
bard
more
skilful
than
any
of
the
king
s
and
they
flung
him
into
prison
until
they
should
see
if
he
could
make
good
his
boast
and
as
he
lay
there
with
a
silver
chain
about
his
feet
a
graceless
fellow
named
rhun
was
sent
to
court
the
wife
of
elphin
and
to
bring
back
proofs
of
her
folly
and
it
was
said
that
neither
maid
nor
matron
with
whom
rhun
conversed
but
was
of
taliesin
then
bade
his
mistress
conceal
herself
and
she
gave
her
raiment
and
jewels
to
one
of
the
kitchenmaids
who
received
rhun
as
if
she
were
mistress
of
the
household
and
after
supper
rhun
plied
the
maid
with
drink
and
she
became
intoxicated
and
fell
in
a
deep
sleep
whereupon
rhun
cut
off
one
of
her
fingers
on
which
was
the
of
elphin
that
he
had
sent
his
wife
a
little
while
before
rhun
brought
the
finger
and
the
ring
on
it
to
arthur
s
court
next
day
elphin
was
fetched
out
of
prison
and
shown
the
finger
and
the
ring
whereupon
he
said
with
thy
leave
mighty
king
i
can
not
deny
the
ring
but
the
finger
it
is
on
was
never
my
wife
s
for
this
is
the
little
finger
and
the
ring
fits
tightly
on
it
but
my
wife
could
barely
keep
it
on
her
thumb
and
my
wife
moreover
is
wont
to
pare
her
nails
every
saturday
night
but
this
nail
hath
not
been
pared
for
a
month
and
thirdly
the
hand
to
which
this
finger
belonged
was
kneading
within
three
days
past
but
my
wife
has
never
kneaded
since
my
wife
she
has
then
the
king
was
angry
because
his
test
had
failed
and
he
ordered
elphin
back
to
prison
till
he
could
prove
what
he
had
affirmed
about
his
bard
prime
bard
of
then
taliesin
went
to
court
and
one
high
day
when
the
king
s
bards
and
minstrels
should
sing
and
play
before
him
taliesin
as
they
passed
him
sitting
quietly
in
a
corner
pouted
his
lips
and
played
blerwm
blerwm
with
his
finger
on
his
mouth
and
when
the
bards
came
to
perform
before
the
king
lo
a
spell
was
on
them
and
they
could
do
nothing
but
bow
before
him
and
play
blerwm
blerwm
with
their
fingers
on
their
lips
and
the
chief
of
them
heinin
said
o
king
we
be
not
drunken
with
wine
but
are
dumb
through
the
influence
of
the
spirit
that
sits
in
yon
corner
under
the
form
of
a
then
taliesin
was
brought
forth
and
they
asked
him
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
and
he
sang
as

when

i
was
in

birth

i
was
at

place
of

of

three
periods
in

it

then

i
for
nine
months
in
the
womb
of
the

ceridwen
i
was
originally
little
gwion
and
at
length
i
am
while
taliesin
sang
a
great
storm
of
wind
arose
and
the
castle
shook
with
the
force
of
it
then
the
king
bade
elphin
be
brought
in
before
him
and
when
he
came
at
the
music
of
taliesin
s
voice
and
harp
the
chains
fell
open
of
themselves
and
he
was
free
and
many
other
poems
concerning
secret
things
of
the
past
and
future
did
taliesin
sing
before
the
king
and
his
lords
and
he
foretold
the
coming
of
the
saxon
into
the
land
and
his
oppression
of
the
cymry
and
foretold
also
his
passing
away
when
the
day
of
his
destiny
should
come
here
we
end
this
long
survey
of
the
legendary
literature
of
the
celt
the
material
is
very
abundant
and
it
is
of
course
not
practicable
in
a
volume
of
this
size
to
do
more
than
trace
the
main
current
of
the
development
of
the
legendary
literature
down
to
the
time
when
the
mythical
and
legendary
element
entirely
faded
out
and
free
literary
invention
took
its
place
the
reader
of
these
pages
will
however
it
is
hoped
have
gained
a
general
conception
of
the
subject
which
will
enable
him
to
understand
the
significance
of
such
tales
as
we
have
not
been
able
to
touch
on
here
and
to
fit
them
into
their
proper
places
in
one
or
other
of
the
great
cycles
of
celtic
legend
it
will
be
noticed
that
we
have
not
entered
upon
the
vast
region
of
celtic
has
not
been
regarded
as
falling
within
the
scope
of
the
present
work
may
sometimes
represent
degraded
mythology
and
sometimes
mythology
in
the
making
in
either
case
it
is
its
special
characteristic
that
it
belongs
to
and
issues
from
a
class
whose
daily
life
lies
close
to
the
earth
toilers
in
the
field
and
in
the
forest
who
render
with
simple
directness
in
tales
or
charms
their
impressions
of
natural
or
supernatural
forces
with
which
their
own
lives
are
environed
mythology
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
appears
only
where
the
intellect
and
the
imagination
have
reached
a
point
of
development
above
that
which
is
ordinarily
possible
to
the
peasant
men
have
begun
to
their
scattered
impressions
and
have
felt
the
impulse
to
shape
them
into
poetic
creations
embodying
universal
ideas
it
is
not
of
course
pretended
that
a
line
can
always
be
drawn
between
mythology
and
still
the
distinction
seems
to
me
a
valid
one
and
i
have
tried
to
observe
it
in
these
pages
after
the
two
historical
chapters
with
which
our
study
has
begun
the
object
of
the
book
has
been
literary
rather
than
scientific
i
have
however
endeavoured
to
give
as
the
opportunity
arose
such
results
of
recent
critical
work
on
the
relics
of
celtic
myth
and
legend
as
may
at
least
serve
to
indicate
to
the
reader
the
nature
of
the
critical
problems
connected
therewith
i
hope
that
this
may
have
added
somewhat
to
the
value
of
the
work
for
students
while
not
impairing
its
interest
for
the
general
reader
furthermore
i
may
claim
that
the
book
is
in
this
sense
scientific
that
as
far
as
possible
it
avoids
any
adaptation
of
its
material
for
the
popular
taste
such
adaptation
when
done
for
an
avowed
artistic
purpose
is
of
course
entirely
legitimate
if
it
were
not
we
should
have
to
condemn
half
the
great
poetry
of
the
world
but
here
the
object
has
been
to
present
the
myths
and
legends
of
the
celt
as
they
actually
are
crudities
have
not
been
refined
away
things
painful
or
monstrous
have
not
been
suppressed
except
in
some
few
instances
where
it
has
been
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
volume
appeals
to
a
wider
audience
than
that
of
scientific
students
alone
the
reader
may
i
think
rely
upon
it
that
he
has
here
a
substantially
fair
and
not
account
of
the
celtic
outlook
upon
life
and
the
world
at
a
time
when
the
celt
still
had
a
free
independent
natural
life
working
out
his
conceptions
in
the
celtic
tongue
and
taking
no
more
from
foreign
sources
than
he
could
assimilate
and
make
his
own
the
legendary
literature
thus
presented
is
the
oldest
literature
of
europe
this
alone
is
sufficient
i
think
to
give
it
a
strong
claim
on
our
attention
as
to
what
other
claims
it
may
have
many
pages
might
be
filled
with
quotations
from
the
discerning
praises
given
to
it
by
critics
not
of
celtic
nationality
from
matthew
arnold
downwards
but
here
let
it
speak
for
itself
it
will
tell
us
i
believe
that
as
maeldūn
said
of
one
of
the
marvels
he
met
with
in
his
voyage
into
fairyland
what
we
see
here
was
a
work
of
mighty
glossary
and
index
the
pronunciation
of
celtic
names
to
render
these
names
accurately
without
the
living
voice
is
impossible
but
with
the
phonetic
renderings
given
where
required
in
the
following
index
and
with
attention
to
the
following
general
rules
the
reader
will
get
as
near
to
the
correct
pronunciation
as
it
is
at
all
necessary
for
him
to
do
gaelic
vowels
are
pronounced
as
in
french
or
german
thus
long
is
like
long
like
in
date
long
like
a
stroke
over
a
letter
signifies
length
thus
dūn
is
pronounced
doon
not
dewn
is
a
guttural
as
in
the
word
it
is
never
pronounced
with
a
sound
as
in
english
is
always
like
is
silent
as
in
english
ii
cymric
when
a
consonant
is
pronounced
as
in
english
when
a
vowel
like
when
long
is
like
when
short
like
in
and
as
in
gaelic
is
like
in
breathe
is
like
english
the
sound
of
is
perhaps
better
not
attempted
by
the
english
reader
it
is
a
thickened
something
between
and
vowels
as
in
gaelic
but
note
that
there
are
strictly
no
diphthongs
in
welsh
in
combinations
of
vowels
each
is

the
ancients
were
not
very
close
observers
of
physical
characteristics
they
describe
the
celts
in
almost
exactly
the
same
terms
as
those
which
they
apply
to
the
germanic
races
rice
holmes
is
of
opinion
that
the
real
difference
physically
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
fairness
of
the
germans
was
blond
and
that
of
the
celts
red
in
an
interesting
passage
of
the
work
already
quoted
he
observes
that
making
every
allowance
for
the
admixture
of
other
blood
which
must
have
considerably
modified
the
type
of
the
original
celtic
or
gallic
invaders
of
these
islands
we
are
struck
by
the
fact
that
among
all
our
fellow
subjects
there
are
to
be
found
numerous
specimens
of
a
type
which
also
exists
in
those
parts
of
brittany
which
were
colonised
by
british
invaders
and
in
those
parts
of
gaul
in
which
the
gallic
invaders
appear
to
have
settled
most
thickly
as
well
as
in
northern
italy
where
the
celtic
invaders
were
once
dominant
and
also
by
the
fact
that
this
type
among
the
more
blond
representatives
of
it
is
strikingly
different
to
the
casual
as
well
as
to
the
scientific
observer
from
that
of
the
purest
representatives
of
the
ancient
the
picture
of
sir
david
wilkie
reading
of
the
waterloo
gazette
illustrates
as
daniel
wilson
remarked
the
difference
between
the
two
types
put
a
perthshire
highlander
side
by
side
with
a
sussex
farmer
both
will
be
fair
but
the
red
hair
and
beard
of
the
scot
will
be
in
marked
contrast
with
the
fair
hair
of
the
englishman
and
their
features
will
differ
still
more
markedly
i
remember
teeing
two
gamekeepers
in
a
railway
carriage
running
from
inverness
to
lairey
they
were
tall
athletic
fair
men
evidently
belonging
to
the
scandinavian
type
which
as
beddoe
says
is
so
common
in
the
extreme
north
of
scotland
but
both
in
colouring
and
in
general
aspect
they
were
utterly
different
from
the
tall
fair
highlanders
whom
i
had
seen
in
perthshire
there
was
not
a
trace
of
red
in
their
hair
their
long
beards
being
absolutely
yellow
the
prevalence
of
red
among
the
people
is
it
seems
to
me
a
most
striking
characteristic
not
only
do
we
find
eleven
men
in
every
hundred
whose
hair
is
absolutely
red
but
underlying
the
blacks
and
the
dark
browns
the
lame
tint
is
to
be

map
of

nigrescence
given

however
the
bretons
are
not
a
dark
race
relatively
to
the
rest
of
the
population
they
are
composed
partly
of
the
ancient
gallic
peoples
and
partly

is

history
tells
of
various
conflicts
with

are
almost
entirely
mythical

irish
is
probably
an
older
form
of
celtic
speech
than
welsh
this
is
shown
by
many
philological
peculiarities
of
the
irish
language
of
which
one
of
the
most
interesting
may
here
be
briefly
referred
to
the
goidelic
or
gaelic
celts
who
according
to
the
usual
theory
first
colonised
the
british
islands
and
who
were
forced
by
successive
waves
of
invasion
by
their
continental
kindred
to
the
extreme
west
had
a
peculiar
dislike
to
the
pronunciation
of
the
letter
thus
the
particle
represented
by
greek
beside
or
close
to
becomes
in
early
celtic
as
in
the
name

armoricans

who

the
place
beside
the
clota
clyde
now
dumbarton
in
germany
near
the
taunus
mountains
when
this
letter
was
not
simply
dropped
it
was
usually
changed
into
k
g
but
about
the
sixth
century
a
remarkable
change
passed
over
the
language
of
the
continental
celts
they
gained
in
some
unexplained
way
the
faculty
for
pronouncing
and
even
substituted
it
for
existing
sounds
thus
the
original
became
britain
the
numeral
four
became
and
so
forth
celtic
in
spain
show
that
this
change
must
have
taken
place
before
the
celtic
conquest
of
that
country
now
a
comparison
of
many
irish
and
welsh
words
shows
distinctly
this
avoidance
of
on
the
irish
side
and
lack
of
any
objection
to
it

the
welsh

the
conclusion
that
irish
must
represent
the
older
form
of
the
language
seems
obvious
it
is
remarkable
that
even
to
a
comparatively
late
date
the
irish
preserved
their
dislike
to
thus
they
turned
the
latin
easter
to
purple
to
through

to
it
must
be
noted
however
that
nicholson
in
his
keltic
researches
endeavours
to
show
that
the
is
standing
alone
and
uncombined
with
another
pronounced
by
the
goidelic
celts
at
an
early
period
the
subject
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
cleared
up

by

let
it
be
added
that
the
aristocratic
celts
were
like
the
teutons
is
to
say
they
had
heads
long
in
proportion
to
their
breadth
this
is
proved
by
remains

populated

them

here
we
have
evidently
a
reminiscence

of

poisoned
tongue
the
of
the
ultonians
the

three
islands
at
the
entrance
of

are
a
perfect
museum
of
mysterious
ruins
pronounced
ghermawn

was
a
particular
delight
to
the
ancient
irish
and
is
mentioned
in
a
poem
in
praise
of
may
as
one
of
the
attractions
of
that
month
the
name
of
the
month
of

given

ancient
gaulish
calendar

the

recorded
as
being
witnessed
by

tale
of

we
are
to
understand
that
he
was
an
anchorite
seeking
for
an
islet
on
which
to
dwell
in
solitude

contemplation
the
western
islands
of

abound
in
the
ruins

the

we
see
here
that
we
have
got
far
from
primitive
celtic
legend
the

fight
like
mediaeval
knights
on

tilting
at

other
with
spears
not
in
chariots

on

not
with

epithet
generally
implying

hoary
antiquity
associated

pronounced
evidently
this
was
the
triangular

shield
not
the
round
or
oval
celtic
one
it
has
already
been
noticed
that
in
these
welsh
tales
the
knights
when
they
fight
tilt
at
each
other
with
spears
the
reader
may
pronounce
this
compare
the
description
of
mac
cecht
in
the
tale
of
the
hostel
of

where
the

is
a

to

no

is
from

small

chalice
a
similar
selective
action
is
ascribed
to
the
grail
by
wolfram
it
can
only
be
lifted
by
a
pure
maiden
when
carried
into
the
hall
and
a
heathen
can
not
see
it
or
be
benefited
by
it
the
same
idea
is
also
strongly
marked
in
the
story
narrating
the
early
history
of
the

by
robert
de
borron
about
the
impure
and
sinful

the
combination
of
objects
at

castle
is
very
significant
they
were
a
sword
a
