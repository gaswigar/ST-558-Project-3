conclusion
biographical
sketch
the
excellent
man
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
this
book
has
described
himself
with
so
much
charm
nature
and
truth
the
principal
events
of
his
life
have
been
recorded
in
such
an
agreeable
and
faithful
manner
that
very
few
words
will
suffice
to
finish
the
story
brillat
savarin
anthelme
counsel
of
the
court
of
cassation
member
of
the
legion
of
honor
member
of
the
society
for
the
encouragement
of
national
industry
of
the
antiquarian
society
of
france
of
the
philoselic
society
of
bourg
was
born
of
april
at
belley
a
little
alpine
city
not
far
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
which
at
this
place
separates
france
from
savoy
like
his
forefathers
who
had
been
for
several
generations
devoted
to
the
bar
the
profession
which
pleased
him
in
consequence
of
his
possession
of
great
eloquence
he
practised
with
great
success
in
the
unanimous
vote
of
his
fellow
citizens
deputed
him
to
the
constituent
assembly
composed
of
all
that
was
most
brilliant
in
the
youth
of
france
at
that
day
less
attached
in
practice
to
the
philosophy
of
zeno
than
that
of
epicurus
his
name
does
not
figure
very
conspicuously
but
always
appears
at
epochs
which
show
that
he
acted
with
the
good
and
moderate
his
legislative
functions
being
determined
by
the
expiration
of
the
constituent
assembly
he
was
first
appointed
president
of
the
superior
civil
court
of
the
department
of
ain
and
subsequently
a
justice
of
the
court
of
cassation
newly
instituted
a
man
of
talent
perfectly
incorruptible
and
unhesitating
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
he
would
have
been
precisely
calculated
for
the
place
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
had
the
warmth
of
political
discussion
made
practicable
the
advice
either
of
moderation
or
of
prudence
in
he
was
mayor
of
belley
and
passed
in
anxiety
there
the
season
of
the
reign
of
terror
whence
he
was
forced
to
fly
to
switzerland
for
an
asylum
against
the
revolutionary
movement
nothing
can
better
man
without
a
personal
enemy
should
be
forced
to
pass
in
a
foreign
land
the
days
he
purposed
to
devote
to
the
improvement
of
his
country
this
is
the
point
when
the
character
of
brillat
savarin
assumes
its
grandest
proportions
proscribed
a
fugitive
and
often
without
pecuniary
resources
frequently
unable
to
provide
for
his
personal
safety
he
was
always
able
to
console
his
companions
in
exile
and
set
them
an
example
of
honest
industry
as
time
rolled
on
and
his
situation
became
more
painful
he
sought
to
find
in
the
new
world
a
repose
which
europe
denied
him
he
came
from
europe
and
in
boston
new
york
philadelphia
and
hartford
passed
two
years
teaching
the
french
language
and
for
a
time
playing
the
first
violin
in
the
orchestra
of
the
park
theatre
like
many
other
emigres
brillat
savarin
ever
sought
to
make
the
pleasant
and
the
useful
coincide
he
always
preserved
very
pleasant
recollection
of
this
period
of
his
life
in
which
he
enjoyed
with
moderate
labor
all
that
is
necessary
for
happiness
liberty
sweetened
by
honest
toil
he
might
say
all
is
well
and
to
be
able
to
enjoy
the
breath
of
my
native
land
would
alone
increase
my
happiness
he
fancied
that
he
saw
brighter
days
with
the
commencement
of
vendemiaire
year
corresponding
to
september
of
appointed
by
the
directory
as
secretary
of
the
general
in
chief
of
the
republican
armies
in
germany
then
commisary
of
the
government
in
the
department
of
the
seine
and
oise
this
appointment
he
held
at
the
epoch
of
the
brumaire
in
which
france
fancied
she
exchanged
liberty
for
repose
sustained
by
the
senate
and
the
court
brillat
savarin
passed
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
respected
by
his
inferiors
loved
by
his
equals
and
honored
by
all
a
man
of
mind
a
pleasant
guest
with
a
deep
fund
of
humor
he
delighted
every
body
his
judicial
labors
did
not
at
all
interfere
with
the
composition
of
this
book
which
he
esteemed
the
great
one
of
his
life
to
the
very
facility
of
its
composition
the
physiology
of
the
taste
owes
its
success
one
would
form
a
very
erroneous
opinion
of
it
were
he
to
estimate
it
at
all
as
we
do
montaigue
writings
on
the
gueule
savarin
was
naturally
a
thoughtful
man
the
simplest
meal
satisfied
him
all
he
required
was
that
it
should
be
prepared
artistically
and
he
maintained
that
the
art
of
cookery
consisted
in
exciting
the
taste
he
used
to
say
to
excite
a
stomach
of
papier
mache
and
enliven
vital
powers
almost
ready
to
depart
a
cook
needs
more
talent
than
he
who
has
solved
the
infintesimal
calculus
the
world
was
much
surprised
by
finding
in
a
book
by
brillat
savarin
a
man
it
had
always
looked
upon
as
simply
a
very
pleasant
person
such
a
vast
collection
of
general
information
after
his
laborious
profession
he
had
always
seemed
to
expend
the
rest
of
his
time
with
the
muses
and
graces
and
none
could
divine
where
he
obtained
so
much
information
as
almost
to
recall
the
story
of
some
sage
of
greece
he
had
however
already
composed
more
than
one
work
unrecognised
if
we
except
the
two
opuscula
critical
and
historical
essay
on
duel
with
relation
to
our
legislation
and
morals
and
a
work
on
judicial
practice
they
were
successful
but
he
was
just
then
attacked
by
a
violent
cold
contracted
by
being
present
at
the
annual
ceremony
footnote
not
only
brillat
savarin
but
robert
de
vincent
and
attorney
general
marchangy
contracted
their
death
in
consequence
of
the
same
ceremonial
the
of
january
at
the
church
of
dennis
in
spite
of
every
care
and
attention
on
the
of
february
he
died
for
many
years
gifted
with
robust
health
and
athletic
constitution
made
the
more
remarkable
by
his
tall
stature
brillat
savarin
had
a
presentiment
of
the
approach
of
death
this
feeling
however
did
not
influence
the
tenor
of
his
life
for
his
habitual
gaity
was
maintained
unimpaired
when
the
fatal
point
was
reached
he
died
tanquam
convivia
satur
not
without
regret
certainly
for
he
left
many
kind
friends
to
whom
his
memory
could
not
but
be
dear
aphorisms
of
the
professor
to
serve
as
prolegomena
to
his
work
and
eternal
basis
to
the
science
i
the
universe
would
be
nothing
were
it
not
for
life
and
all
that
lives
must
be
fed
ii
animals
fill
themselves
man
eats
the
man
of
mind
alone
knows
how
to
eat
iii
the
destiny
of
nations
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
they
are
fed
iv
tell
me
what
kind
of
food
you
eat
and
i
will
tell
you
what
kind
of
man
you
are
the
creator
when
he
obliges
man
to
eat
invites
him
to
do
so
by
appetite
and
rewards
him
by
pleasure
vi
gourmandise
is
an
act
of
our
judgment
in
obedience
to
which
we
grant
a
preference
to
things
which
are
agreeable
over
those
which
nave
not
that
quality
vii
the
pleasure
of
the
table
belongs
to
all
ages
to
all
conditions
to
all
countries
and
to
all
aeras
it
mingles
with
all
other
pleasures
and
remains
at
last
to
console
us
for
their
departure
viii
the
table
is
the
only
place
where
one
does
not
suffer
from
ennui
during
the
first
hour
ix
the
discovery
of
a
new
dish
confers
more
happiness
on
humanity
than
the
discovery
of
a
new
star
x
those
persons
who
suffer
from
indigestion
or
who
become
drunk
are
utterly
ignorant
of
the
true
principles
of
eating
and
drinking
xi
the
order
of
food
is
from
the
most
substantial
to
the
lightest
xii
the
order
of
drinking
is
from
the
mildest
to
the
most
foamy
and
perfumed
xiii
to
say
that
we
should
not
change
our
drinks
is
a
heresy
the
tongue
becomes
saturated
and
after
the
third
glass
yields
but
an
obtuse
sensation
xiv
a
dessert
without
cheese
is
like
a
beautiful
woman
who
has
lost
an
eye
xv
a
cook
may
be
taught
but
a
man
who
can
roast
is
born
with
the
faculty
xvi
the
most
indispensable
quality
of
a
good
cook
is
promptness
it
should
also
be
that
of
the
guests
xvii
to
wait
too
long
for
a
dilatory
guest
shows
disrespect
to
those
who
are
punctual
xviii
he
who
receives
friends
and
pays
no
attention
to
the
repast
prepared
for
them
is
not
fit
to
have
friends
xix
the
mistress
of
the
house
should
always
be
certain
that
the
coffee
be
excellent
the
master
that
his
liquors
be
of
the
first
quality
xx
to
invite
a
person
to
your
house
is
to
take
charge
of
his
happiness
as
long
as
he
be
beneath
your
roof
dialogue
between
the
author
and
his
friend
after
the
usual
salutations
friend
as
my
wife
and
myself
were
at
breakfast
this
morning
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
you
should
print
as
soon
as
possible
your
gastronomical
observations
author
what
the
wife
wishes
god
wills
in
six
words
that
is
the
charta
of
paris
i
though
am
not
subject
to
that
law
for
i
am
an
unmarried
man
friend
bachelors
though
are
as
subject
to
the
law
as
others
are
sometimes
much
to
our
injury
single
blessedness
here
however
will
not
save
you
my
wife
says
she
has
a
right
to
order
because
you
began
your
book
at
her
author
you
know
dear
doctor
how
i
defer
to
the
ladies
more
than
once
you
have
found
my
submission
to
their
orders
you
also
were
one
of
those
who
said
i
would
make
an
excellent
husband
i
will
not
however
print
my
book
friend
why
not
author
because
being
devoted
from
the
nature
of
my
profession
to
serious
studies
i
fear
that
those
who
only
know
the
title
of
my
book
will
think
that
i
devote
myself
to
trifles
friend
a
panic
terror
years
of
constant
toil
and
labor
for
the
public
have
made
you
a
reputation
besides
my
wife
and
i
think
every
body
would
read
you
author
indeed
friend
the
learned
will
read
your
book
to
ascertain
what
you
have
to
tell
author
perhaps
friend
women
will
read
your
book
because
they
will
see
author
my
dear
friend
i
am
old
i
am
attacked
by
a
fit
of
wisdom
miserere
mei
friend
gourmands
will
read
you
because
you
do
them
justice
and
assign
them
their
suitable
rank
in
society
author
well
that
is
true
it
is
strange
that
they
have
so
long
been
misunderstood
i
look
on
the
dear
gourmands
with
paternal
affection
they
are
so
kind
and
their
eyes
are
so
bright
friend
besides
did
you
not
tell
me
such
a
book
was
needed
in
every
library
author
i
did
it
is
the
truth
and
i
would
die
sooner
than
deny
it
friend
ah
you
are
convinced
you
will
come
home
with
me
author
not
so
if
there
be
flowers
in
the
author
path
there
are
also
thorns
the
latter
i
leave
to
my
heirs
friend
but
then
you
disinherit
your
friends
acquaintances
and
cotemporaries
dare
you
do
so
author
my
heirs
my
heirs
i
have
heard
that
shades
of
the
departed
are
always
flattered
by
the
praise
of
the
living
this
is
a
state
of
beatitude
i
wish
to
reserve
myself
for
the
other
world
friend
but
are
you
sure
that
the
praise
you
love
so
will
come
to
the
right
address
are
you
sure
of
the
exactness
of
your
heirs
author
i
have
no
reason
to
think
they
will
neglect
a
duty
in
consideration
of
which
i
have
excused
them
the
neglect
of
so
many
others
friend
will
they
can
they
have
for
your
book
the
paternal
love
the
author
attention
without
which
every
work
always
comes
awkwardly
before
the
public
author
my
manuscript
will
be
corrected
written
out
distinctly
and
in
all
respects
prepared
they
will
only
have
to
print
it
friend
and
the
chapter
of
events
alas
such
circumstances
have
caused
the
loss
of
many
precious
books
among
which
was
that
of
the
famous
lecat
on
the
state
of
the
body
during
sleep
the
work
of
his
whole
life
author
this
doubtless
was
a
great
loss
but
i
anticipate
no
such
regrets
for
my
book
friend
believe
me
your
friends
will
have
enough
to
arrange
matters
with
the
church
with
the
law
and
with
the
medical
faculty
so
that
if
they
had
the
will
they
would
not
have
the
time
to
devote
to
the
various
cares
which
precede
accompany
and
follow
the
publication
of
a
book
however
small
the
volume
may
be
author
but
my
friend
what
a
title
think
of
the
ridicule
friend
the
word
gastronomy
makes
every
ear
attentive
the
subject
is
a
la
mode
and
those
who
laugh
are
as
great
votaries
of
the
science
as
any
others
are
this
should
satisfy
you
do
you
remember
too
that
the
greatest
men
have
sometimes
written
books
on
very
trivial
subjects
for
example
footnote
de
monjucla
known
as
the
author
of
an
excellent
history
of
mathematics
made
a
dictionary
of
gourmand
geography
he
showed
me
portions
of
it
during
my
residence
at
versailles
it
is
said
that
of
legal
practice
has
written
a
romance
in
several
volumes
on
the
subject
author
quickly
on
my
word
that
is
true
he
wrote
the
temple
of
gnidus
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
sustain
that
there
is
more
real
utility
in
meditating
on
what
is
at
once
a
necessity
a
pleasure
and
an
occupation
every
day
of
our
lives
than
in
telling
what
was
done
and
said
a
thousand
years
ago
by
two
mad
people
one
of
whom
pursued
through
the
woods
of
greece
the
other
who
had
not
the
least
disposition
to
escape
friend
ah
ha
now
you
yield
author
not
i
the
ass
ear
of
the
author
only
was
shown
and
this
recalls
to
my
memory
a
scene
of
english
comedy
which
amused
me
very
much
it
is
i
think
in
the
play
called
the
natural
daughter
you
shall
see
however
for
yourself
footnote
the
reader
will
observe
that
my
friend
permits
me
to
be
familiar
with
him
without
taking
advantage
of
it
the
reason
is
that
the
difference
between
our
ages
is
that
of
a
father
and
a
son
and
that
though
now
a
man
of
great
note
and
importance
in
every
respect
he
would
be
completely
overcome
with
grief
if
i
changed
my
bearing
towards
him
the
subject
relates
to
the
quakers
that
sect
which
uses
thee
and
thou
to
everybody
which
dresses
simply
never
go
to
war
never
swear
or
act
with
passion
and
who
never
get
angry
the
hero
of
this
piece
is
a
young
and
handsome
quaker
who
appears
on
the
scene
in
a
brown
coat
a
hat
and
slick
hair
all
this
though
does
not
keep
him
from
being
in
love
a
fool
who
is
his
rival
emboldened
by
his
exterior
ridicules
and
outrages
him
so
that
the
young
man
gradually
becoming
excited
and
finally
made
furious
gives
his
assailant
a
severe
thrashing
having
done
this
he
at
once
resumes
his
habitual
deportment
and
says
sadly
alas
the
flesh
is
too
mighty
for
the
spirit
thus
say
i
and
after
a
brief
hesitation
resume
my
first
opinion
friend
that
is
impossible
you
have
shown
your
ear
you
are
a
prize
and
i
will
take
you
to
my
bookseller
i
will
tell
you
who
has
gotten
wind
of
your
secret
author
do
not

would
speak
of
yourself
and
who
knows
what
i
would
say

what
could

not

when

at

me
of
a
difficulty
he
had
the
day
before
with
the
count
de

cessac
then
a
high
officer
of
the
ministry
of
war
about
a
certain
economy
which
the
latter
proposed
as
a
means
of
paying
his
court
napoleon
the
economy
consisted
in
retrenching
the
allowances
of
hospital
so
as
to
restrict
men
who
had
wounds
from
the
comforts
they
were
entitled
to
doctor
coste
said
such
measures
were
abominable
and
he
became
angry
i
do
not
know
what
the
result
was
but
only
that
the
sick
soldiers
had
their
usual
allowances
and
that
no
change
was
made
he
was
appointed
professor
of
the
faculty
of

his
style
was
simple
and
his
addresses
were
plain
and
fruitful
honors
were
crowded

him

was
appointed
physician
to
the
empress
marie
louise
he
did
not
however
fill
that
place

my

will
pardon
this
digression
of
an
old
man
who
during
an
absence
of
thirty
years
has
neither
forgotten
his
country
nor
his
countrymen
i
could
not
however
omit
all
those
physicians
the
memory
of
whom
is
yet
preserved
in
their
place
and
who
though
not
conspicuous
had
not
on
that
account
the
less
merit
or
worth
footnote
the
translator
thinks
several
have
made
names
preface
in
offering
to
the
public
the
work
i
now
produce
i
have
undertaken
no
great
labor
i
have
only
put
in
order
materials
i
had
collected
long
ago
the
occupation
was
an
amusing
one
which
i
reserved
for
my
old
age
when
i
thought
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
under
every
point
of
view
i
saw
that
something
better
than
a
common
cookery
book
could
be
made
out
of
it
and
that
much
might
be
said
about
essential
and
continuous
things
which
have
a
direct
influence
on
health
happiness
and
even
on
business
when
i
had
once
gotten
hold
of
the
idea
all
the
rest
came
naturally
i
looked
around
took
notes
and
amidst
the
most
sumptuous
festivals
looked
at
the
guests
thus
i
escaped
many
of
the
dangers
of
conviviality
to
do
what
i
have
undertaken
one
need
not
be
a
physician
chemist
physiologist
or
even
a
savant
all
i
learned
i
learned
without
the
least
idea
that
i
would
ever
be
an
author
i
was
impressed
by
a
laudable
curiosity
by
the
fear
of
remaining
behind
my
century
and
by
an
anxiety
to
be
able
to
sit
at
table
on
equal
terms
with
the
savants
i
used
to
meet
i
am
essentially
an
amateur
medecin
and
this
to
me
is
almost
a
mania
among
the
happiest
days
of
my
life
when
with
the
professors
i
went
to
hear
the
thesis
of
doctor
cloquet
i
was
delighted
when
i
heard
the
murmur
of
the
students
voices
each
of
whom
asked
who
was
the
foreign
professor
who
honored
the
college
with
his
presence
one
other
day
is
i
think
almost
as
dear
to
me
i
refer
to
the
meeting
of
the
society
for
the
encouragement
of
national
industry
when
i
presented
the
irrorator
an
instrument
of
my
own
invention
which
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
forcing
pump
filled
with
perfumes
i
had
an
apparatus
fully
charged
in
my
pocket
i
turned
the
cock
and
thence
pressed
out
a
perfume
which
filled
the
whole
room
then
i
saw
with
inexpressible
pleasure
the
wisest
heads
of
the
capital
bend
beneath
my
irrigation
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
those
who
received
most
were
the
happiest
thinking
sometimes
of
the
grave
lucubrations
to
which
i
was
attracted
by
my
subject
i
really
as
afraid
that
i
would
be
troublesome
i
have
often
read
very
stupid
books
i
did
all
that
i
could
to
escape
this
reproach
i
have
merely
hovered
over
subjects
which
presented
themselves
to
me
i
have
filled
my
book
with
anecdotes
some
of
which
to
a
degree
are
personal
i
have
omitted
to
mention
many
strange
and
singular
things
which
critical
judgment
induced
me
to
reject
and
i
recalled
popular
attention
to
certain
things
which
savants
seemed
to
have
reserved
to
themselves
if
in
spite
of
all
these
efforts
i
have
not
presented
to
my
readers
a
science
rarely
understood
i
shall
sleep
just
as
calmly
being
certain
that
the
majority
will
acquit
me
of
all
evil
intention
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
sometimes
i
wrote
too
rapidly
and
that
sometimes
i
became
garrulous
is
it
my
fault
that
i
am
old
is
it
my
fault
that
like
ulysses
i
have
seen
the
manners
and
customs
of
many
cities
am
i
therefore
blamable
for
writing
a
little
bit
of
autobiography
let
the
reader
however
remember
that
i
do
not
inflict
my
political
memoirs
on
him
which
he
would
have
to
read
as
he
has
many
others
since
during
the
last
thirty
years
i
have
been
exactly
in
the
position
to
see
great
men
and
great
things
let
no
one
assign
me
a
place
among
compilers
had
i
been
reduced
thus
low
i
would
have
laid
down
my
pen
and
would
not
have
lived
less
happily
i
said
like
juvenal
semper
ego
auditor
tantum
nunquamne
reponam
and
those
who
know
me
will
easily
see
that
used
to
the
tumult
of
society
and
to
the
silence
of
the
study
i
had
to
take
advantage
of
both
one
and
the
other
of
these
positions
i
did
too
many
things
which
pleased
me
particularly
i
was
able
to
mention
many
friends
who
did
not
expect
me
to
do
so
and
recalled
some
pleasant
memories
i
seized
on
others
which
would
have
escaped
and
as
we
say
familiarly
took
my
coffee
it
may
be
a
single
reader
may
in
some
category
exclaim
i
wished
to
know
if
what
was
he
thinking
of
etc
i
am
sure
though
the
others
will
make
him
be
silent
and
receive
with
kindness
the
effusions
of
a
praiseworthy
sentiment
i
have
something
to
say
about
my
style
which
as
buffon
says
is
all
the
man
let
none
think
i
come
to
ask
for
a
favor
which
is
never
granted
to
those
who
need
it
i
wish
merely
to
make
an
explanation
i
should
write
well
for
voltaire
jean
jacques
fenelon
buffon
and
cochin
and
aguesseau
were
my
favorite
authors
i
knew
them
by
heart
it
may
be
though
that
the
gods
ordered
otherwise
if
so
this
is
the
cause
of
the
will
of
the
gods
i
know
five
languages
which
now
are
spoken
which
gives
me
an
immense
refectory
of
words
when
i
need
a
word
and
do
not
find
it
in
french
i
select
it
from
other
tongues
and
the
reader
has
either
to
understand
or
translate
me
such
is
my
fate
i
could
have
acted
otherwise
but
was
prevented
by
a
kind
of
system
to
which
i
was
invincibly
attached
i
am
satisfied
that
the
french
language
which
i
use
is
comparatively
poor
what
could
i
do
either
borrow
or
steal
i
did
neither
for
such
borrowings
can
not
be
restored
though
to
steal
words
is
not
punishable
by
the
penal
code
any
one
may
form
an
idea
of
my
audacity
when
i
say
i
applied
the
spanish
word
volante
to
any
one
i
had
sent
on
an
errand
and
that
i
had
determined
to
gallicise
the
english
word
to
sip
which
means
to
drink
in
small
quantities
i
however
dug
out
the
french
word
siroter
which
expresses
nearly
the
same
thing
i
am
aware
the
purists
will
appeal
to
bosseux
to
fenelon
raceri
boilleau
pascal
and
others
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
i
fancy
i
hear
their
clamor
to
all
this
i
reply
distinctly
that
i
do
not
depreciate
the
merit
of
those
authors
but
what
follows
nothing
except
that
if
they
played
well
on
an
inferior
instrument
how
much
better
would
they
have
done
on
a
superior
one
therefore
we
may
believe
that
tartini
would
have
played
on
the
violin
far
better
than
he
did
if
his
bow
had
been
long
as
that
of
baillot
i
do
not
belong
to
the
neologues
or
even
to
the
romanticists
the
last
are
discoverers
of
hidden
treasures
the
former
are
like
sailors
who
go
about
to
search
for
provisions
they
need
the
people
of
the
north
and
especially
the
english
have
in
this
respect
an
immense
advantage
over
us
genius
is
never
restricted
by
the
want
of
expression
which
is
either
made
or
created
thus
it
is
that
of
all
subjects
which
demand
depth
and
energy
our
translations
make
but
pale
and
dull
infusions
once
i
heard
at
the
institute
a
pleasant
discourse
on
the
danger
of
neologism
and
on
the
necessity
of
maintaining
our
language
as
it
was
when
the
authors
of
the
great
century
wrote
like
a
chemist
i
sifted
the
argument
and
ascertained
that
it
meant
we
have
done
so
well
that
we
neither
need
nor
can
do
better
now
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
know
that
each
generation
has
done
as
much
and
that
each
one
laughs
at
his
grandfather
besides
words
must
change
when
manners
and
ideas
undergo
perpetual
modifications
if
we
do
things
as
the
ancients
did
we
do
not
do
them
in
the
same
manner
there
are
whole
pages
in
many
french
books
which
can
not
be
translated
into
latin
or
greek
all
languages
had
their
birth
their
apogee
and
decline
none
of
those
which
have
been
famous
from
the
days
of
sesostris
to
that
of
philip
augustus
exist
except
as
monuments
the
french
will
have
the
same
fate
and
in
the
year
if
read
will
be
read
with
a
dictionary
i
once
had
a
terrible
argument
on
this
matter
with
the
famous
andrieux
at
the
academie
francaise
i
made
my
assault
in
good
array
i
attacked
him
vigorously
and
would
have
beaten
him
had
he
not
made
a
prompt
retreat
to
which
i
opposed
no
obstacle
fortunately
for
him
as
he
was
making
one
letter
of
the
new
lexicon
i
end
by
one
important
observation
for
that
reason
i
have
kept
it
till
the
last
when
i
write
of
me
in
the
singular
i
gossip
with
my

he
may

or

first
the
senses
the
senses
are
the
organs
by
which
man
places
himself
in
connexion
with
exterior
objects
number
of
the
senses
they
are
at
least
six
sight
which
embraces
space
and
tells
us
by
means
of
light
of
the
existence
and
of
the
colors
of
the
bodies
around
us
hearing
which
by
the
motion
of
the
air
informs
us
of
the
motion
of
sounding
or
vibrating
bodies
scent
by
means
of
which
we
are
made
aware
of
the
odors
bodies
possess
taste
which
enables
us
to
distinguish
all
that
has
a
flavor
from
that
which
is
insipid
touch
informs
us
of
the
consistency
and
resistance
of
bodies
the
last
is
genesiac
or
physical
love
which
attracts
the
sexes
to
each
other
and
the
object
of
which
is
the
reproduction
of
the
species
it
is
astonishing
that
almost
to
the
days
of
buffon
so
important
a
sense
was
misunderstood
and
was
confounded
with
the
touch
yet
the
sensation
of
which
it
is
the
seat
has
nothing
in
common
with
touch
it
resides
in
an
apparatus
as
complete
as
the
mouth
or
the
eyes
and
what
is
singular
is
that
each
sex
has
all
that
is
needed
to
experience
the
sensation
it
is
necessary
that
the
two
should
be
united
to
reach
nature
object
if
the
taste
the
object
of
which
is
the
preservation
of
the
individual
be
incontestibly
a
sense
the
same
title
must
indubitably
be
preserved
on
the
organs
destined
to
the
preservation
of
the
species
let
us
then
assign
to
the
genesiac
the
sensual
place
which
can
not
be
refused
to
it
and
let
us
leave
to
posterity
the
assignment
of
its
peculiar
rank
action
of
the
senses
if
we
were
permitted
even
in
imagination
to
refer
to
the
first
moments
of
the
existence
of
the
human
race
we
would
believe
that
the
first
sensations
were
direct
that
is
to
say
that
all
saw
confusedly
and
indirectly
smelled
without
care
ate
without
tasting
etc
the
centre
of
all
these
sensations
however
being
the
soul
the
sensual
attribute
of
humanity
and
active
cause
of
perfectibility
they
are
reflected
compared
and
judged
by
it
the
other
senses
then
come
to
the
assistance
of
each
other
for
the
utility
and
of
the
sensitive
one
or
individual
thus
touch
rectifies
the
errors
of
sight
sound
by
means
of
articulate
speech
becomes
the
interpreter
of
every
sentiment
taste
is
aided
by
sight
and
smell
hearing
compares
sounds
appreciates
distance
and
the
genesiac
sense
takes
possession
of
the
organs
of
all
the
senses
the
torrent
of
centuries
rolling
over
the
human
race
has
continually
brought
new
perfections
the
cause
of
which
ever
active
though
unseen
is
found
in
the
demands
made
by
our
senses
which
always
in
their
turns
demand
to
be
occupied
sight
thus
gave
birth
to
painting
to
sculpture
and
to
spectacles
of
every
kind
sound
to
melody
harmony
to
the
dance
and
to
music

all
its
branches
and

taste
to
the
production
choice
and

of
all
that
is
used
for
food
touch
to
all
art
trades
and
occupations
the
genesiac
sense
to
all
which
prepares
or
embellishes
the
reunion
of
senses
and
subsequently
to
the
days
of
francois
to
romantic
love
to
coquetry
which
originated
in
france
and
obtained
its
name
there
and
from
which
the
elite
of
the
world
collected
in
the
capital
of
the
universe
take
their
lessons
every
day
this
proposition
strange
as
it
seems
is
very
susceptible
of
demonstration
we
can
not
express
with
clearness
in
any
ancient
language
ideas
about
these
three
great
motives
of
actual
society
i
had
written
a
dialogue
on
this
subject
but
suppressed
it
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
reader
each
in
his
own
way
to
think
of
the
matter
for
himself
there
is
enough
to
occupy
the
mind
and
display
intelligence
and
erudition
during
a
whole
evening
we
said
above
that
the
genesiac
sense
took
possession
of
the
organs
of
all
the
others
the
influence
it
has
exerted
over
all
sciences
is
not
less
when
we
look
closer
we
will
find
that
all
that
is
most
delicate
and
ingenious
is
due
to
the
desire
to
hope
or
to
gratitude
in
connexion
with
the
union
of
the
sexes
such
is
indeed
the
genealogy
of
the
senses
even
the
most
abstract
ones
all
being
the
immediate
result
of
continuous
efforts
made
to
gratify
our
senses
perfectness
of
the
senses
these
senses
our
favorites
are
far
from
being
perfect
and
i
will
not
pause
to
prove
it
i
will
only
observe
that
that
ethereal
sense
sight
and
touch
which
is
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
scale
have
from
time
acquired
a
very
remarkable
additional
power
by
means
of
spectacles
the
eye
so
to
say
escapes
from
the
decay
of
age
which
troubles
almost
all
the
other
organs
the
telescope
has
discovered
stars
hitherto
unknown
and
inaccessible
to
all
our
means
of
mensuration
it
has
penetrated
distances
so
great
that
luminous
and
necessarily
immense
bodies
present
themselves
to
us
only
like
nebulous
and
almost
imperceptible
spots
the
microscope
has
made
us
acquainted
with
the
interior
configuration
of
bodies
or
has
shown
the
existence
of
a
vegetation
and
of
plants
the
existence
of
which
we
were
ignorant
of
animals
a
hundred
thousand
times
smaller
than
any
visible
with
the
naked
eye
have
been
discovered
these
animalculae
however
move
feed
and
multiply
establishing
the
existence
of
organs
of
inconceivable
tenuity
mechanics
have
multiplied
our
power
man
has
executed
all
that
he
could
conceive
of
and
has
moved
weights
nature
made
inaccessible
to
his
weakness
by
means
of
arms
and
of
the
lever
man
has
conquered
all
nature
he
has
subjected
it
to
his
pleasure
wants
and
caprices
he
has
overturned
its
surfaces
and
a
feeble
biped
has
become
king
of
creation
sight
and
touch
being
thus
increased
in
capacity
might
belong
to
some
species
far
superior
to
man
or
rather
the
human
species
would
be
far
different
had
all
the
senses
been
thus
improved
we
must
in
the
meantime
remark
that
if
touch
has
acquired
a
great
development
as
a
muscular
power
civilization
has
done
almost
nothing
for
it
as
an
organ
of
sensation
we
must
however
despair
of
nothing
but
remember
that
the
human
race
is
yet
young
and
that
only
after
a
long
series
of
years
can
the
senses
aggrandise
their
domain
for
instance
harmony
was
only
discovered
about
four
centuries
ago
and
that
celestial
science
is
to
sound
what
painting
is
to
colors
certainly
the
ancients
used
to
sing
and
accompany
themselves
in
unison
their
knowledge
however
ended
there
they
knew
neither
how
to
decompose
sounds
nor
to
appreciate
their
relations
footnote
we
are
aware
that
the
contrary
has
been
maintained
the
idea
though
can
not
be
supported
had
the
ancients
been
acquainted
with
harmony
their
writings
would
have
preserved
some
precise
notion
on
the
matter
instead
of
a
few
obscure
phrases
which
may
be
tortured
to
mean
anything
besides
we
can
not
follow
the
birth
and
progress
of
harmony
in
the
monuments
left
to
us
this
obligation
we
owe
to
the
arabs
who
made
us
a
present
of
the
organ
which
produces
at
one
time
many
continuous
sounds
and
thus
created
harmony
tone
was
only
reduced
to
system
and
accords
measured
in
the
fifteenth
century
only
then
it
was
used
to
sustain
the
voice
and
to
reinforce
the
expression
of
sentiments
this
discovery
made
at
so
late
a
day
yet
so
natural
doubled
the
hearing
and
has
shown
the
existence
of
two
somewhat
independent
faculties
one
of
which
receives
sound
and
the
other
appreciates
resonance
the
german
doctors
say
that
persons
sensible
of
harmony
have
one
sense
more
than
others
of
those
persons
to
whom
music
is
but
a
confused
mass
of
sounds
we
may
remark
that
almost
all
sing
false
we
are
forced
to
think
that
they
have
the
auditory
apparatus
so
made
as
to
receive
but
brief
and
short
undulation
or
that
the
two
ears
not
being
on
the
same
diapason
the
difference
in
length
and
sensibility
of
these
constituent
parts
causes
them
to
transmit
to
the
brain
only
an
obscure
and
undetermined
sensation
like
two
instruments
played
in
neither
the
same
key
nor
the
same
measure
and
which
can
produce
no
continuous
melody
the
centuries
last
passed
have
also
given
the
taste
important
extension
the
discovery
of
sugar
and
its
different
preparations
of
alcoholic
liquors
of
wine
ices
vanilla
tea
and
coffee
have
given
us
flavors
hitherto
unknown
who
knows
if
touch
will
not
have
its
day
and
if
some
fortuitous
circumstance
will
not
open
to
us
thence
some
new
enjoyments
this
is
especially
probable
as
tactile
sensitiveness
exists
every
where
in
the
body
and
consequently
can
every
where
be
excited
we
have
seen
that
physical
love
has
taken
possession
of
all
the
sciences
in
this
respect
it
acts
with
its
habitual
tyranny
the
taste
is
a
more
prudent
measure
but
not
less
active
faculty
taste
we
say
has
accomplished
the
same
thing
with
a
slowness
which
ensures
its
success
elsewhere
we
will
consider
the
march
we
may
however
observe
that
he
who
has
enjoyed
a
sumptuous
banquet
in
a
hall
decked
with
flowers
mirrors
paintings
and
statues
embalmed
in
perfume
enriched
with
pretty
women
filled
with
delicious
harmony
will
not
require
any
great
effort
of
thought
to
satisfy
himself
that
all
sciences
have
been
put
in
requisition
to
exalt
and
to
enhance
the
pleasures
of
taste
object
of
the
action
of
the
senses
let
us
now
glance
at
the
system
of
our
senses
considered
together
and
we
will
see
that
the
author
of
creation
had
two
objects
one
of
which
is
the
consequence
of
the
other
the
preservation
of
the
individual
and
the
duration
of
the
species
such
is
the
destiny
of
man
considered
as
a
sensitive
being
all
his
actions
have
reference
to
this
double
purpose
the
eye
perceives
external
objects
reveals
the
wonders
by
which
a
man
is
surrounded
and
tells
him
he
is
a
portion
of
the
great
whole
hearing
perceives
sounds
not
only
as
an
agreeable
sensation
but
as
warnings
of
the
movement
of
bodies
likely
to
endanger
us
the
sense
of
touch
watches
to
warn
us
by
pain
of
any
immediate
lesion
that
faithful
servant
the
hand
has
prepared
his
defence
assured
his
steps
but
has
from
instinct
seized
objects
it
thought
needed
to
repair
losses
caused
by
the
use
of
life
the
sense
of
smell
explores
deleterious
substances
almost
always
have
an
unpleasant
smell
the
taste
decides
the
teeth
are
put
in
action
the
tongue
unites
with
the
palate
in
tasting
and
the
stomach
soon
commences
the
process
of
assimilation
in
this
state
a
strange
languor
is
perceived
objects
seem
discolored
the
body
bends
the
eyes
close
all
disappears
and
the
senses
are
in
absolute
repose
when
he
awakes
man
sees
that
nothing
around
him
has
changed
a
secret
fire
ferments
in
his
bosom
a
new
organ
is
developed
he
feels
that
he
wishes
to
divide
his
existence
this
active
unquiet
and
imperious
sentiment
is
common
to
both
sexes
it
attracts
them
together
and
unites
them
and
when
the
germ
of
a
new
being
is
fecundated
the
individuals
can
sleep
in
peace
they
have
fulfilled
the
holiest
of
their
duties
by
assuring
the
duration
of
the
species
footnote
buffon
describes
with
all
the
charms
of
the
most
brilliant
eloquence
the
first
moments
of
existence
called
on
to
describe
almost
the
same
subject
we
have
drawn
but
one
feature
the
reader
will
complete
the
picture
such
are
the
general
and
philosophical
principles
i
wished
to
place
before
my
readers
to
lead
them
naturally
to
the
examination
of
the
organ
of
taste
meditation
ii
taste
definition
of
taste
taste
is
the
sense
which
communicates
to
us
a
knowledge
of
vapid
bodies
by
means
of
the
sensations
which
they
excite
taste
which
has
as
its
excitement
appetite
hunger
and
thirst
is
the
basis
of
many
operations
the
result
of
which
is
that
the
individual
believes
developes
preserves
and
repairs
the
losses
occasioned
by
vital
evaporation
organized
bodies
are
not
sustained
in
the
same
manner
the
author
of
creation
equally
varied
in
causes
and
effects
has
assigned
them
different
modes
of
preservation
vegetables
which
are
the
lowest
in
the
scale
of
living
things
are
fed
by
roots
which
implanted
in
the
native
soil
select
by
the
action
of
a
peculiar
mechanism
different
subjects
which
serve
to
increase
and
to
nourish
them
as
we
ascend
the
scale
we
find
bodies
gifted
with
animal
life
and
deprived
of
locomotion
they
are
produced
in
a
medium
which
favors
their
existence
and
have
special
and
peculiar
organs
which
extract
all
that
is
necessary
to
sustain
the
portion
and
duration
of
life
allotted
them
they
do
not
seek
food
which
on
the
contrary
comes
to
seek
them
another
mode
has
been
appointed
for
animals
endowed
with
locomotion
of
which
man
is
doubtless
the
most
perfect
a
peculiar
instinct
warns
him
of
the
necessity
of
food
he
seeks
and
seizes
the
things
which
he
knows
are
necessary
to
satisfy
his
wants
he
eats
renovates
himself
and
thus
during
his
life
passes
through
the
whole
career
assigned
to
him
taste
may
be
considered
in
three
relations
in
physical
man
it
is
the
apparatus
by
means
of
which
he
appreciates
flavors
in
moral
man
it
is
the
sensation
which
the
organ
impressed
by
any
savorous
centre
impresses
on
the
common
centre
considered
as
a
material
cause
taste
is
the
property
which
a
body
has
to
impress
the
organ
and
to
create
a
sensation
taste
seems
to
have
two
chief
uses
it
invites
us
by
pleasure
to
repair
the
losses
which
result
from
the
use
of
life
it
assists
us
to
select
from
among
the
substances
offered
by
nature
those
which
are
alimentary
in
this
choice
taste
is
powerfully
aided
by
the
sense
of
smell
as
we
will
see
hereafter
as
a
general
principle
it
may
be
laid
down
that
nutritious
substances
are
repulsive
neither
to
the
taste
nor
to
the
smell
it
is
difficult
to
say
in
exactly
what
the
faculty
of
taste
consists
it
is
more
complicated
than
it
appears
the
tongue
certainly
plays
a
prominent
part
in
the
mechanism
of
degustation
for
being
endued
with
great
muscular
power
it
enfolds
turns
presses
and
swallows
food
also
by
means
of
the
more
or
less
numerous
pores
which
cover
it
it
becomes
impregnated
with
the
sapid
and
soluble
portions
of
the
bodies
which
it
is
placed
in
contact
with
yet
all
this
does
not
suffice
for
many
adjacent
parts
unite
in
completing
the
sensation
viz
jaws
palate
and
especially
the
nasal
tube
to
which
physiologists
have
perhaps
not
paid
attention
enough
the
jaws
furnish
saliva
as
necessary
to
mastication
as
to
the
formation
of
the
digestible
mass
they
like
the
palate
are
gifted
with
a
portion
of
the
appreciative
faculties
i
do
not
know
that
in
certain
cases
the
nose
does
not
participate
and
if
but
for
the
odor
which
is
felt
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
sensation
of
taste
would
not
be
obtuse
and
imperfect
persons
who
have
no
tongue
or
who
have
lost
it
yet
preserve
the
sensation
of
taste
all
the
books
mention
the
first
case
the
second
was
explained
to
me
by
an
unfortunate
man
whose
tongue
had
been
cut
out
by
the
algerines
for
having
with
several
of
his
companions
formed
a
plot
to
escape
from
captivity
i
met
this
man
at
amsterdam
where
he
was
a
kind
of
broker
he
was
a
person
of
education
and
by
writing
was
perfectly
able
to
make
himself
understood
observing
that
his
whole
tongue
to
the
very
attachment
had
been
cut
away
i
asked
him
if
he
yet
preserved
any
sense
of
taste
when
he
ate
and
if
the
sense
of
taste
had
survived
the
cruel
operation
he
had
undergone
he
told
me
his
greatest
annoyance
was
in
swallowing
which
indeed
was
difficult
that
he
had
a
full
appreciation
of
tastes
and
flavors
but
that
acid
and
bitter
substances
produced
intense
pain
he
told
me
the
abscission
of
the
tongue
was
very
common
in
the
african
kingdoms
and
was
made
use
of
most
frequently
to
punish
those
thought
to
be
the
leaders
of
any
plot
and
that
they
had
peculiar
instruments
to
affect
it
with
i
wished
him
to
describe
them
but
he
showed
such
painful
reluctance
in
this
matter
that
i
did
not
insist
i
reflected
on
what
he
said
and
ascending
to
the
centuries
of
ignorance
when
the
tongues
of
blasphemers
were
cut
and
pierced
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
these
punishments
were
of
moorish
origin
and
were
imported
by
the
crusaders
we
have
seen
above
that
the
sensation
of
taste
resided
chiefly
in
the
pores
and
feelers
of
the
tongue
anatomy
tells
us
that
all
tongues
are
not
exactly
alike
there
being
three
times
as
many
feelers
in
some
tongues
as
in
others
this
circumstance
will
explain
why
one
of
two
guests
sitting
at
the
same
table
is
delighted
while
the
other
seems
to
eat
from
constraint
the
latter
has
a
tongue
but
slightly
provided
these
are
recognized
in
the
empire
of
the
taste
both
deaf
and
dumb
sensation
of
taste
five
or
six
opinions
have
been
advanced
as
to
the
modus
operandi
of
the
sensation
of
taste
i
have
mine
viz
the
sensation
of
taste
is
a
chemical
operation
produced
by
humidity
that
is
to
say
the
savorous
particles
must
be
dissolved
in
some
fluid
so
as
to
be
subsequently
absorbed
by
the
nervous
tubes
feelers
or
tendrils
which
cover
the
interior
of
the
gastatory
apparatus
this
system
whether
true
or
not
is
sustained
by
physical
and
almost
palpable
proofs
pure
water
creates
no
sensation
because
it
contains
no
sapid
particle
dissolve
however
a
grain
of
salt
or
infuse
a
few
drops
of
vinegar
and
there
will
be
sensation
other
drinks
on
the
contrary
create
sensation
because
they
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
liquids
filled
with
appreciable
particles
it
would
be
in
vain
for
the
mouth
to
fill
itself
with
the
divided
particles
of
an
insoluble
body
the
tongue
would
feel
by
touch
the
sensation
of
their
presence
but
not
that
of
taste
in
relation
to
solid
and
savorous
bodies
it
is
necessary
in
the
first
place
for
the
teeth
to
divide
them
that
the
saliva
and
other
tasting
fluids
to
imbibe
them
and
that
the
tongue
press
them
against
the
palate
so
as
to
express
a
juice
which
when
sufficiently
saturated
by
the
degastory
tendrils
deliver
to
the
substance
the
passport
it
requires
for
admission
into
the
stomach
this
system
which
will
yet
receive
other
developments
replies
without
effort
to
the
principal
questions
which
may
present
themselves
if
we
demand
what
is
understood
by
sapid
bodies
we
reply
that
it
is
every
thing
that
has
flavor
which
is
soluble
and
fit
to
be
absorbed
by
the
organ
of
taste
if
asked
how
a
sapid
body
acts
we
reply
that
it
acts
when
it
is
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
dissolution
that
it
enters
the
cavities
made
to
receive
it
in
a
word
nothing
is
sapid
but
what
is
already
or
nearly
dissolved
flavors
the
number
of
flavors
is
infinite
for
every
soluble
body
has
a
peculiar
flavor
like
none
other
flavors
are
also
modified
by
their
simple
double
or
multiple
aggregation
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
description
either
of
the
most
pleasant
or
of
the
most
unpleasant
of
the
raspberry
or
of
colocynth
all
who
have
tried
to
do
so
have
failed
this
result
should
not
amaze
us
for
being
gifted
with
an
infinite
variety
of
simple
flavors
which
mixture
modifies
to
such
a
number
and
to
such
a
quantity
a
new
language
would
he
needed
to
express
their
effects
and
mountains
of
folios
to
describe
them
numerical
character
alone
could
label
them
now
as
yet
no
flavor
has
ever
been
appreciated
with
rigorous
exactness
we
have
been
forced
to
be
satisfied
with
a
limited
number
of
expressions
such
as
sweet
sugary
acid
bitter
and
similar
ones
which
when
ultimately
analyzed
are
expressed
by
the
two
following
agreeable
and
disagreeable
which
suffice
to
make
us
understood
and
indicate
the
flavor
of
the
sapid
substances
referred
to
those
who
come
after
us
will
know
more
for
doubtless
chemistry
will
reveal
the
causes
or
primitive
elements
of
flavors
influence
of
smelling
on
the
taste
the
order
i
marked
out
for
myself
has
insensibly
led
me
to
the
moment
to
render
to
smell
the
rights
which
belong
to
it
and
to
recognise
the
important
services
it
renders
to
taste
and
the
application
of
flavors
among
the
authors
i
have
met
with
i
recognise
none
as
having
done
full
justice
to
it
for
my
own
part
i
am
not
only
persuaded
that
without
the
interposition
of
the
organs
of
smell
there
would
be
no
complete
degustation
and
that
the
taste
and
the
sense
of
smell
form
but
one
sense
of
which
the
mouth
is
the
laboratory
and
the
nose
the
chimney
or
to
speak
more
exactly
that
one
tastes
tactile
substances
and
the
other
exhalations
this
may
be
vigorously
defended
yet
as
i
do
not
wish
to
establish
a
school
i
venture
on
it
only
to
give
my
readers
a
subject
of
thought
and
to
show
that
i
have
carefully
looked
over
the
subject
of
which
i
write
now
i
continue
my
demonstration
of
the
importance
of
the
sense
of
smell
if
not
as
a
constituent
portion
of
taste
at
least
as
a
necessary
adjunct
all
sapid
bodies
are
necessarily
odorous
and
therefore
belong
as
well
to
the
empire
of
the
one
as
of
the
other
sense
we
eat
nothing
without
seeing
this
more
or
less
plainly
the
nose
plays
the
part
of
sentinel
and
always
cries
who
goes
there
close
the
nose
and
the
taste
is
paralyzed
a
thing
proved
by
three
experiments
any
one
can
make
when
the
nasal
membrane
is
irritated
by
a
violent
coryza
cold
in
the
head
the
taste
is
entirely
obliterated
there
is
no
taste
in
anything
we
swallow
yet
the
tongue
is
in
its
normal
state
if
we
close
the
nose
when
we
eat
we
are
amazed
to
see
how
obscure
and
imperfect
the
sense
of
touch
is
the
most
disgusting
medicines
thus
are
swallowed
almost
without
taste
the
same
effect
is
observed
if
as
soon
as
we
have
swallowed
instead
of
restoring
the
tongue
to
its
usual
place
it
be
kept
detached
from
the
palate
thus
the
circulation
of
the
air
is
intercepted
the
organs
of
smell
are
not
touched
and
there
is
no
taste
these
effects
have
the
same
cause
from
the
fact
that
the
sense
of
smell
does
not
with
the
taste
the
sapid
body
is
appreciated
only
on
account
of
the
juice
and
not
for
the
odorous
gas
which
emanates
from
it
analysis
of
the
sensation
of
taste
principles
being
thus
determined
i
look
on
it
as
certain
that
taste
has
given
place
to
sensations
of
three
different
orders
viz
direct
complete
and
reflected
direct
sensation
is
the
first
perception
emanating
from
the
intermediate
organs
of
the
mouth
during
the
time
that
the
sapid
body
rests
on
the
tongue
complete
sensation
is
that
composed
of
the
first
impression
which
is
created
when
the
food
abandons
this
first
position
passes
into
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
impresses
all
the
organ
with
both
taste
and
perfume
reflected
sensation
is
the
judgment
which
conveys
to
the
soul
the
impressions
transmitted
to
it
by
the
organ
let
us
put
this
system
in
action
by
observing
what
takes
place
when
a
man
either
eats
or
drinks
let
a
man
for
instance
eat
a
peach
and
he
will
first
be
agreeably
impressed
by
the
odor
which
emanates
from
it
he
places
it
in
his
mouth
and
acid
and
fresh
flavors
induce
him
to
continue
not
though
until
he
has
swallowed
it
does
the
perfume
reveal
itself
nor
does
he
till
then
discover
the
peculiar
flavor
of
every
variety
some
time
is
necessary
for
any
gourmet
footnote
any
gentleman
or
lady
who
may
please
is
at
perfect
liberty
to
translate
the
word
gourmet
into
any
other
tongue
i
can
not
as
much
may
be
said
of
to
say
it
is
good
passable
or
bad
it
is
chambertin
or
something
else
it
may
then
be
seen
that
in
obedience
to
principles
and
practice
well
understood
true
amateurs
sip
their
wine
every
mouthful
thus
gives
them
the
sum
total
of
pleasure
which
they
would
not
have
enjoyed
had
they
swallowed
it
at
once
the
same
thing
takes
place
with
however
much
more
energy
when
the
taste
is
disagreeably
affected
just
look
at
the
patient
of
some
doctor
who
prescribes
immense
doses
of
black
medicine
such
as
were
given
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
the
sense
of
smell
like
a
faithful
counsellor
foretells
its
character
the
eyes
expand
as
they
do
at
the
approach
of
danger
disgust
is
on
the
lips
and
the
stomach
at
once
rebells
he
is
however
besought
to
take
courage
gurgles
his
throat
with
brandy
closes
his
nose
and
swallows
as
long
as
the
odious
compound
fills
the
mouth
and
stuns
the
organ
it
is
tolerable
but
when
it
has
been
swallowed
the
after
drops
develop
themselves
nauseous
odors
arise
and
every
feature
of
the
patient
expresses
horror
and
disgust
which
the
fear
of
death
alone
could
induce
him
to
bear
if
the
draught
be
on
the
contrary
merely
insipid
as
for
instance
a
glass
of
water
there
is
neither
taste
nor
after
taste
nothing
is
felt
nothing
is
experienced
it
is
swallowed
and
all
is
over
order
of
the
impressions
of
taste
taste
is
not
so
richly
endowed
as
the
hearing
the
latter
can
appreciate
and
compare
many
sounds
at
once
the
taste
on
the
contrary
is
simple
in
its
action
that
is
to
say
it
can
not
be
sensible
to
two
flavors
at
once
it
may
though
be
doubled
and
multipled
by
succession
that
is
to
say
that
in
the
act
of
swallowing
there
may
be
a
second
and
even
a
third
sensation
each
of
which
gradually
grows
weaker
and
weaker
and
which
are
designated
by
the
words
perfume
or
fragrance
thus
when
a
chord
is
struck
one
ear
exercises
and
discharges
many
series
of
consonances
the
number
of
which
is
not
as
yet
perfectly
known
those
who
eat
quickly
and
without
attention
do
not
discern
impressions
of
the
second
degree
they
belong
only
to
a
certain
number
of
the
elect
and
by
the
means
of
these
second
sensations
only
can
be
classed
the
different
substances
submitted
to
their
examination
these
fugitive
shadows
for
a
long
time
vibrate
in
the
organ
of
taste
the
professors
beyond
doubt
always
assume
an
appropriate
position
and
when
they
give
their
opinions
they
always
do
so
with
expanded
nostrils
and
with
their
necks
protruded
far
as
they
can
go
enjoyments
due
to
the
taste
let
us
now
look
philosophically
at
the
pleasure
and
pain
occasioned
by
taste
the
first
thing
we
become
convinced
of
is
that
man
is
organized
so
as
to
be
far
more
sensible
of
pain
than
of
pleasure
in
fact
the
imbibing
of
acid
or
bitter
substances
subjects
us
to
sensations
more
or
less
painful
according
to
their
degree
it
is
said
that
the
cause
of
the
rapid
effects
of
hydrocyanic
acid
is
that
the
pain
is
so
great
as
to
be
unbearable
by
the
powers
of
vitality
the
scale
of
agreeable
sensations
on
the
other
hand
is
very
limited
and
if
there
be
a
sensible
difference
between
the
insipid
and
that
which
flatters
the
taste
the
interval
is
not
so
great
between
the
good
and
the
excellent
the
following
example
proves
this
first
term
a
bouilli
dry
and
hard
second
term
a
piece
of
veal
third
term
a
pheasant
done
to
a
turn
of
all
the
senses
though
with
which
we
have
been
endowed
by
nature
the
taste
is
the
one
which
all
things
considered
procures
us
the
most
enjoyments
because
the
pleasure
of
eating
is
the
only
one
when
moderately
enjoyed
not
followed
by
fatigue
it
belongs
to
all
aeras
ages
and
ranks
because
it
necessarily
returns
once
a
day
and
may
without
inconvenience
be
twice
or
thrice
repeated
in
the
same
day
it
mingles
with
all
other
pleasures
and
even
consoles
us
for
their
absence
because
the
impressions
it
receives
are
durable
and
dependant
on
our
will
because
when
we
eat
we
receive
a
certain
indefinable
and
peculiar
impression
of
happiness
originating
in
instinctive
conscience
when
we
eat
too
we
repair
our
losses
and
prolong
our
lives
this
will
be
more
carefully
explained
in
the
chapter
we
devote
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
considered
as
it
has
been
advanced
by
civilization
supremacy
of
man
we
were
educated
in
the
pleasant
faith
that
of
all
things
that
walk
swim
crawl
or
fly
man
has
the
most
perfect
taste
this
faith
is
liable
to
be
shaken
gall
relying
on
i
know
not
what
examinations
says
there
are
many
animals
with
the
gustatory
apparatus
more
developed
and
extended
than
man
this
does
not
sound
well
and
looks
like
heresy
man
jure
divino
king
of
all
nature
for
the
benefit
of
whom
the
world
was
peopled
must
necessarily
be
supplied
with
an
organ
which
places
him
in
relation
to
all
that
is
sapid
in
his
subjects
the
tongue
of
animals
does
not
exceed
their
intelligence
in
fishes
the
tongue
is
but
a
movable
bone
in
birds
it
is
usually
a
membranous
cartilage
and
in
quadrupeds
it
is
often
covered
with
scales
and
asperities
and
has
no
circumflex
motion
the
tongue
of
man
on
the
contrary
from
the
delicacy
of
its
texture
and
the
different
membranes
by
which
it
is
surrounded
and
which
are
near
to
it
announces
the
sublimity
of
the
operations
to
which
it
is
destined
i
have
at
least
discovered
three
movements
unknown
to
animals
which
i
call
spication
rotation
and
verration
from
the
latin
verb
verro
i
sweep
the
first
is
when
the
tongue
like
a
pike
comes
beyond
the
lips
which
repress
it
the
second
is
when
the
tongue
rotates
around
all
the
space
between
the
interior
of
the
jaws
and
the
palate
the
third
is
when
the
tongue
moves
up
and
down
and
gathers
the
particles
which
remain
in
the
half
circular
canal
formed
by
the
lips
and
gums
animals
are
limited
in
their
taste
some
live
only
on
vegetables
others
on
flesh
others
feed
altogether
on
grain
none
know
anything
of
composite
flavors
man
is
omnivorous
all
that
is
edible
is
subjected
to
his
vast
appetite
a
thing
which
causes
gustatory
powers
proportionate
to
the
use
he
has
to
make
of
them
the
apparatus
of
taste
is
a
rare
perfection
of
man
and
we
have
only
to
see
him
use
it
to
be
satisfied
of
it
as
soon
as
any
esculent
body
is
introduced
into
the
mouth
it
is
confiscated
hopelessly
gas
juice
and
all
the
lips
prevent
its
retrogression
the
teeth
take
possession
of
it
and
crush
it
the
salva
imbibes
it
the
tongue
turns
it
over
and
over
an
aspiration
forces
it
to
the
thorax
the
tongue
lifts
it
up
to
suffer
it
to
pass
the
sense
of
smell
perceives
it
en
route
and
it
is
precipitated
into
the
stomach
to
undergo
ulterior
transformations
without
the
most
minute
fragment
during
the
whole
of
this
escaping
every
drop
every
atom
has
been
appreciated
in
consequence
of
this
perfection
gourmandise
is
the
exclusive
apanage
of
man
this
gourmandise
is
even
contagious
and
we
impart
it
without
difficulty
to
the
animals
we
have
appropriated
to
our
use
and
which
in
a
manner
associate
with
us
such
as
elephants
dogs
cats
and
parrots
even
besides
taste
requiring
to
be
estimated
only
by
the
value
of
the
sensation
it
communicates
to
the
common
centre
the
impression
received
by
the
animal
can
not
be
compared
to
that
imparted
to
man
the
latter
is
more
precise
and
clear
and
necessarily
supposes
a
superior
quality
in
the
organ
which
transmits
it
in
fine
what
can
we
desire
in
a
faculty
susceptible
of
such
perfection
that
the
gourmands
of
rome
were
able
to
distinguish
the
flavors
of
fish
taken
above
and
below
the
bridge
have
we
not
seen
in
our
own
time
that
gourmands
can
distinguish
the
flavor
of
the
thigh
on
which
the
partridge
lies
down
from
the
other
are
we
not
surrounded
by
gourmets
who
can
tell
the
latitude
in
which
any
wine
ripened
as
surely
as
one
of
biot
or
arago
disciples
can
foretell
an
eclipse
the
consequence
then
is
that
we
must
render
to
caesar
the
things
which
are
caesar
and
proclaim
man
the
great
gourmand
of
nature
and
not
be
surprised
if
the
good
doctor
does
sometimes
as
homer
did
much
zumeilen
ichlafert
der
gute
method
of
the
author
as
yet
we
have
treated
the
taste
only
from
the
physical
point
of
view
and
in
some
anatomical
details
which
none
will
regret
we
have
remained
pari
passu
with
science
this
does
not
however
conclude
the
task
we
have
imposed
on
ourselves
for
from
its
usual
attributes
especially
does
this
reparatory
sense
derive
its
importance
we
have
then
arranged
in
analytical
order
the
theories
and
facts
which
compose
the
ensemble
of
this
history
so
that
instruction
without
fatigue
will
result
from
it
thus
in
the
following
chapters
we
will
often
show
how
sensations
by
repetition
and
reflection
have
perfected
the
organs
and
extended
the
sphere
of
our
powers
how
the
want
of
food
once
a
mere
instinct
has
become
a
passion
which
has
assumed
a
marked
ascendency
of
all
that
belongs
to
society
we
will
also
say
how
all
sciences
which
have
to
do
with
the
composition
of
substances
have
agreed
to
place
in
a
separate
category
all
those
appreciable
to
the
taste
and
how
travellers
have
followed
in
the
same
pathway
when
they
placed
before
us
substances
nature
apparently
never
meant
us
to
see
we
will
follow
chemistry
to
the
very
moment
when
it
penetrated
our
subterraneous
laboratories
to
enlighten
our
preparers
to
establish
principles
to
create
methods
and
to
unveil
causes
which
had
remained
occult
in
fine
we
will
see
by
the
combined
power
of
time
and
experience
that
a
new
science
has
all
at
once
appeared
which
feeds
nourishes
restores
preserves
persuades
consoles
and
not
content
with
strewing
handsfull
of
flowers
over
the
individual
contributes
much
to
the
power
and
prosperity
of
empires
if
amid
the
grave
lucubrations
a
piquante
anecdote
or
an
agreeable
reminiscence
of
a
stormy
life
drips
from
my
pen
we
will
let
it
remain
to
enable
the
attention
to
rest
for
a
moment
so
that
our
readers
the
number
of
whom
does
not
alarm
us
may
have
time
to
breathe
we
would
like
to
chat
with
them
if
they
be
men
we
know
they
are
indulgent
as
they
are
well
informed
if
women
they
must
be
charming
footnote

the
professor
full
of
his

suffers
his

gastronomy
origin
of
sciences
the
sciences
are
not
like
minerva
who
started
ready
armed
from
the
brain
of
jupiter
they
are
children
of
time
and
are
formed
insensibly
by
the
collection
of
the
methods
pointed
out
by
experience
and
at
a
later
day
by
the
principles
deduced
from
the
combination
of
these
methods
thus
old
men
the
prudence
of
whom
caused
them
to
be
called
to
the
of
invalids
whose
compassion
taught
to
cure
wounds
were
the
first
physicians
the
shepherds
of
egypt
who
observed
that
certain
stars
after
the
lapse
of
a
certain
period
of
time
met
in
the
heavens
were
the
first
astronomers
the
person
who
first
uttered
in
simple
language
the
truth
created
mathematics
that
mighty
science
which
really
placed
man
on
the
throne
of
the
universe
in
the
course
of
the
last
sixty
years
many
new
sciences
have
taken
their
place
in
the
category
of
our
knowledge
among
which
is
stereotomy
descriptive
geometry
and
the
chemistry
of
gas
all
sciences
cultivated
for
a
long
time
must
advance
especially
as
the
art
of
printing
makes
retrogression
impossible
who
knows
for
instance
if
the
chemistry
of
gases
will
not
ultimately
overcome
those
as
yet
rebellious
substances
mingle
and
combine
them
in
proportions
not
as
yet
tempted
and
thence
obtain
substances
and
effects
which
would
remove
many
restrictions
in
our
powers
origin
of
gastronomy
gastronomy
has
at
last
appeared
and
all
the
sister
sciences
have
made
a
way
for
it
well
what
could
be
refused
to
that
which
sustains
us
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
which
increases
the
gratifications
of
love
and
the
confidence
of
friendship
which
disarms
hatred
and
offers
us
in
the
short
passage
of
our
lives
the
only
pleasure
which
not
being
followed
by
fatigue
makes
us
weary
of
all
others
certainly
as
long
as
it
was
confided
to
merely
hired
attendants
as
long
as
the
secret
was
kept
in
cellars
and
where
dispensaries
were
written
the
results
were
but
the
products
of
an
art
at
last
too
late
perhaps
savants
drew
near
they
examined
analyzed
and
classified
alimentary
substances
and
reduced
them
to
simple
elements
they
measured
the
mysteries
of
assimilation
and
following
most
matter
in
all
its
metamorphoses
saw
how
it
became
vivified
they
watched
diet
in
its
temporary
and
permanent
effects
for
days
months
and
lives
they
even
estimated
its
influence
and
thought
to
ascertain
if
the
savor
he
impressed
by
the
organs
or
if
it
acts
without
them
from
all
this
they
deduced
a
lofty
theory
which
embraces
all
mankind
and
all
that
portion
of
creation
which
may
be
animalized
while
all
this
was
going
on
in
the
studies
of
savants
it
was
said
in
that
the
science
which
fed
man
was
at
least
as
valuable
as
that
which
killed
him

the

they
presented
such
were
the
circumstances
which
preceded
the
invention
of
gastronomy
definition
of
gastronomy
gastronomy
is
a
scientific
definition
of
all
that
relates
to
man
as
a
feeding
animal
its
object
is
to
watch
over
the
preservation
of
man
by
means
of
the
best
possible
food
it
does
so
by
directing
according
to
certain
principles
all
those
who
procure
search
for
or
prepare
things
which
may
be
converted
into
food
to
tell
the
truth
this
is
what
moves
cultivators
fishermen
huntsmen
and
the
immense
family
of
cooks
whatever
title
or
qualification
they
bear
to
the
preparation
of
food
gastronomy
is
a
chapter
of
natural
history
for
the
fact
that
it
makes
a
classification
of
alimentary
substances
of
physics
for
it
examines
their
properties
and
qualities
of
chemistry
from
the
various
analysis
and
decomposition
to
which
it
subjects
them
of
cookery
from
the
fact
that
it
prepares
food
and
makes
it
agreeable
of
commerce
from
the
fact
that
it
purchases
at
as
low
a
rate
as
possible
what
it
consumes
and
displays
to
the
greatest
advantage
what
it
offers
for

rules
all

of
the

for
the

of

the

man

with
some
degree

the

is
all

the

gastronomy
considers
taste
in
its
pleasures
and
in
its
pains
it
has
discovered
the
gradual
excitements
of
which
it
is
susceptible
it
regularizes
its
action
and
has
fixed
limits
which
a
man
who
respects
himself
will
never
pass
it
also
considers
the
action
of
food
or
aliments
on
the
moral
of
man
on
his
imagination
his
mind
his
judgment
his
courage
and
his
perceptions
whether
he
is
awake
sleeps
acts
or
reposes
gastronomy
determines
the
degree
of
esculence
of
every
alimentary
subject
all
are
not
presentable
under
the
same
circumstances
some
can
be
eaten
until
they
are
entirely
developed
such
like
as
capres
asparagus
sucking
pigs
squabs
and
other
animals
eaten
only
when
they
are
young
others
as
soon
as
they
have
reached
all
the
perfection
to
which
they
are
destined
like
melons
fruit
mutton
beef
and
grown
animals
others
when
they
begin
to
decompose
such
as
snipe
cock
and
pheasant
others
not
until
cooking
has
destroyed
all
their
injurious
properties
such
as
the
potato
manioc
and
other
substances
gastronomy
classifies
all
of
these
substances
according
to
their
qualities
and
indicates
those
which
will
mingle
and
measuring
the
quantity
of
nourishment
they
contain
distinguishes
those
which
should
make
the
basis
of
our
repast
from
those
which
are
only
accessories
and
others
which
though
not
necessary
are
an
agreeable
relief

become
the
obligato
accompaniment
of
convivial
gossip
it
takes
no
less
interest
in
the
beverages
intended
for
us
according
to
time
place
and

it
teaches
their
preparation

and
especially
presents
them
in
an
order
so
exactly
calculated
that
the
pleasure
perpetually
increases
until

ends
and

begins
gastronomy
examines

for
the
purpose
of
transporting
from

utility
of

gastronomical
knowledge
is
necessary
to
all

for
it
tends
to
augment
the
sum
of

this
utility
becomes
the
greater
in
proportion
as
it
is
used
by
the
more
comfortable
classes
of

it
is
indispensable
to

either
because
in
this
respect
they
discharge
an
obligation
follow
their

they
have

special
advantage
that
they
take

their

the

was
fifty

said
the

i

you
must
be

fifty

do
you
intend
to
feast
my

no
prince
there
will
be
but
one
on

and
the

i
need
for
my

my
blonds

bertrand
you
are
robbing

this

will
not

said
the

you
do
not

me
give
the
order
and
i
will
put
those
fifty
hams
in
a
chrystal
flask
no
longer
than
my
thumb
what
could
be
said
to
such
a
positive
operation
the
prince
smiled
and
the
hams
were
passed
influence
of
gastronomy
in
business
in
men
not
far
removed
from
a
state
of
nature
it
is
well
known
that
all
important
affairs
are
discussed
at
their
feasts
amid
their
festivals
savages
decide
on
war
and
peace
we
need
not
go
far
to
know
that
villages
decide
on
all
public
affairs
at
the
cabinet
this
observation
has
not
escaped
those
to
whom
the
weightiest
affairs
are
often
confided
they
saw
that
a
full
stomached
individual
was
very
different
from
a
fasting
one
that
the
table
established
a
kind
of
alliance
between
the
parties
and
made
guests
more
apt
to
receive
certain
impressions
and
submit
to
certain
influences
this
was
the
origin
of
political
gastronomy
entertainments
have
become
governmental
measures
and
the
fate
of
nations
is
decided
on
in
a
banquet
this
is
neither
a
paradox
nor
a
novelty
but
a
simple
observation
of
fact
open
every
historian
from
the
time
of
herodotus
to
our
own
days
and
it
will
be
seen
that
not
even
excepting
conspiracies
no
great
event
ever
took
place
not
conceived
prepared
and
arranged
at
a
festival
gastronomical
academy
such
at
the
first
glance
appears
to
be
the
domain
of
gastronomy
a
realm
fertile
in
results
of
every
kind
and
which
is
aggrandized
by
the
discoveries
and
inventions
of
those
who
cultivate
it
it
is
certain
that
before
the
lapse
of
many
years
gastronomy
will
have
its
academicians
courses
professors
and
premiums
at
first
some
rich
and
zealous
gastronomer

definition

motion

occasion
in
the
animal
portion
of
all
that
lives
a
constant
loss
of
substance
and
the
human
body
that
most
complicated
machine
would
soon
be
unfit
for
use
did
not
providence
provide
it
with
a
mark
to
inform
it
of
the
very
moment
when
its
power
is
no
longer
in
equilibrium
with
its
wants
this
monitor
is
appetite
by
this
word
we
understand
the
first
impression
of
the
want
of
food
appetite
declares
itself
by
languor
in
the
stomach
and
a
slight
sensation
of
fatigue
the
soul
at
the
same
time
busies
itself
with
things
analogous
to
its
wants
memory
recalls
food
that
has
flattered
its
taste
imagination
fancies
that
it
sees
them
and
something
like
a
dream
takes
place
this
state
is
not
without
pleasure
and
we
have
heard
many
adepts
say
with
joy
in
their
heart
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
have
a
good
appetite
when
we
are
certain
of
a
good
meal
the
whole
nutritive
apparatus
is
moved
the
stomach
becomes
sensible
the
gastric
juices
are
moved
and
displace
themselves
with
noise
the
mouth
becomes
moist
and
all
the
digestive
powers
are
under
arms
like
soldiers
awaiting
the
word
of
command
after
a
few
moments
there
will
be
spasmodic
motion
pain
and
hunger
every
shade
of
these
gradations
may
be
observed
in
every
room
when
dinner
is
delayed
they
are
such
in
nature
that
the
most
exquisite
politeness
can
not
disguise
the
symptoms
from
this
fact
i
deduced
the
apothegm
the
most
indispensable
quality
of
a
good
cook
is
promptness
anecdote
i
will
sustain
this
grave
maxim
by
the
details
of
an
observate
made
at
an
entertainment
where
i
was
quorum
magna
pars
fui
and
where
the
pleasures
of
observation
preserved
me
from
the
anguish
of
misery
i
was
invited
to
dine
with
a
high
public
functionary
the
hour
was
half
past
five
and
at
the
appointed
time
all
were
present
we
knew
he
liked
exactness
and
always
scolded
the
dilatory
i
was
amazed
when
i
came
at
the
consternation
which
pervaded
the
party
people
whispered
together
and
looked
into
the
through
the
window
all
betokened
something
extraordinary
i
approached
the
one
of
the
guests
i
thought
best
able
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
and
asked
him
what
the
news
was
alas
said
they
monsieur
has
been
sent
for
to
the
council
of
state
he
has
just
gone
and
none
know
when
he
will
return
is
that
all
said
i
be
of
good
cheer
we
will
be
detained
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
something
particular
has
happened
all
know
is
his
regular
dinner
and
we
will
not
have
to
fast
i
was
not
however
easy
and
wished
i
was
away
the
first
hour
passed
well
enough
and
those
who
were
intimate
sat
together
common
places
were
exhausted
and
conjectures
were
formed
as
to
what
could
have
called
the
prince
to
the
tuilleries
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
hour
there
were
many
signs
of
impatience
people
looked
anxiously
at
each
other
and
the
first
who
murmured
were
three
or
four
guests
who
finding
no
place
to
sit
in
were
not
in
a
convenient
position
to
wait
at
the
third
hour
the
discontent
became
general
and
every
symptom
became
exaggerated
when
will
he
return
said
one
what
can
he
be
thinking
of
said
another
this
is
death
said
a
third
this
question
was
then
put
but
not
determined
shall
we
go
or
not
at
the
fourth
hour
every
symptom
became
aggravated
people
stretched
out
their
arms
without
the
slightest
regard
whether
they
interrupted
their
neighbors
or
not
unpleasant
sounds
were
heard
from
all
parts
of
the
room
and
everywhere
the
faces
of
the
guests
bore
the
marks
of
concentration
no
one
listened
to
me
when
i
remarked
that
beyond
doubt
our
absent
amphytrion
was
more
unhappy
than
any
one
of
us
our
attention
was
for
a
moment
arrested
by
an
apparition
one
of
the
guests
better
acquainted
with
the
house
than
the
others
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
and
returned
panting
his
face
looked
as
if
the
day
of
judgment
had
come
and
in
an
almost
inarticulate
voice
which
announced
at
once
both
the
fear
of
making
a
noise
and
of
not
being
heard
monsigneur
went
away
without
giving
any
orders
and
happen
what
may
dinner
will
not
be
served
until
his
return
the
terror
caused
by
what
he
said
could
not
be
exceeded
by
that
to
be
expected
at
the
last
trump
among
the
martyrs
the
most
unfortunate
was
whom
all
paris
knew
his
whole
body
seemed
to
suffer
and
the
agony
of
laocoon
was
marked
on
his
face
pale
terrified
he
saw
nothing
but
sank
in
a
chair
grasped
his
hands
on
his
round
stomach
and
closed
his
eyes
not
to
sleep
but
to
die
he
did
not
though
about
ten
a
carriage
drove
into
the
yard
all
were
on
the
and
a
arose
spontaneously
hilarity
succeeded
suffering
and
in
five
minutes
we
were
at
the
table
appetite
however
was
gone
all
seemed
amazed
to
sit
down
to
dinner
at
such
an
unusual
hour
the
jaws
had
not
that
isochronous
measure
which
announces
a
regular
business
i
know
many
were
sufferers
thus
the
course
to
be
taken
is
not
to
eat
immediately
after
the
obstacle
has
ceased
but
to
drink
a
glass
of
or
take
a
plate
of
soup
to
sustain
the
stomach
and
then
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
to
begin
dinner
to
prevent
the
stomach
being
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
the
aliments
with
which
it
is
surcharged
great
appetites
when
we
see
in
early
books
a
description
of
the
preparations
made
to
receive
two
or
three
persons
and
the
enormous
masses
served
up
to
a
single
guest
we
can
not
refuse
to
think
that
those
who
lived
in
early
ages
were
gifted
with
great
appetites
the
appetite
was
thought
to
increase
in
direct
ratio
to
the
dignity
of
the
personage
he
to
whom
the
saddle
of
a
five
year
old
ox
would
be
served
was
expected
to
drink
from
a
cup
he
could
scarcely
lift
some
individuals
have
existed
who
testified
to
what
once
passed
and
have
collected
details
of
almost
incredible
variety
which
included
even
the
foulest
objects
i
will
not
inflict
these
disgusting
details
on
my
readers
and
prefer
to
tell
them
two
particular
circumstances
which
i
witnessed
and
which
do
not
require
any
great
exertion
of
faith
about
forty
years
ago
i
made
a
short
visit
to
the
cure
at
bregnier
a
man
of
immense
stature
and
who
had
a
fearful
appetite
though
it
was
scarcely
noon
i
found
him
at
the
table
soup
and
bouilli
had
been
brought
on
to
these
two
indispensables
had
succeeded
a
leg
of
mutton
a
la
royale
a
capon
and
a
salad
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
ordered
a
plate
which
i
refused
and
rightly
too
without
any
assistance
he
got
rid
of
every
thing
viz
he
picked
the
bone
of
mutton
and
ate
up
all
the
salad
they
brought
him
a
large
white
cheese
into
which
he
made
an
angular
breach
measured
by
an
arc
of
ninety
degrees
he
washed
down
all
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
glass
of
water
after
which
he
laid
down
what
pleased
me
was
to
see
that
during
the
whole
of
this
business
the
venerable
pastor
did
not
seem
busy
the
large
mouthfulls
he
swallowed
did
not
prevent
him
either
from
laughing
or
talking
he
dispatched
all
that
was
put
before
him
easily
as
he
would
have
a
pair
of
birds
so
it
was
with
general
bisson
who
drank
eight
bottles
of
wine
at
dinner
every
day
and
who
never
appeared
the
worse
for
it
he
had
a
glass
larger
than
usual
and
emptied
it
oftener
he
did
not
care
for
that
though
for
after
having
swallowed
six
ounces
of
fluids
he
could
jest
and
give
his
orders
as
if
he
had
only
swallowed
a
thimble
full
this
anecdote
recalls
to
me
my
townsman
general
sibuet
long
the
chief
aide
of
napoleon
and
who
was
killed
in
at
the
passage
of
the
bober
he
was
eighteen
years
old
and
had
at
that
time
the
appetite
by
which
nature
announces
that
its
possessor
is
a
perfect
man
and
went
one
night
into
the
kitchen
of
genin
an
inn
keeper
of
belley
where
the
old
men
of
the
town
used
to
meet
to
eat
chestnuts
and
drink
the
new
white
wine
called
in
the
country
vin
bourru
the
old
men
were
not
hungry
and
paid
no
attention
to
him
his
digestive
powers
were
not
shaken
though
and
he
said
i
have
just
left
the
table
but
i
will
bet
that
i
eat
a
whole
turkey
if
you
eat
it
i
will
pay
for
it

bouvier

rich
farmer
who
was
present

you
do
not

the

cut
off
a
wing
he
ate
it
at
two
mouthfulls
and
cleaned
his
teeth
by
gnawing
the
bone
and
drank
a
glass
of

an
interlude

then
went
into

ate

kingdoms
are
those
which
until
now
have
furnished
food
to
the
human
race
since
analytical
chemistry
has
become
a

science
much
progress
has
been
made
into
the
double
nature
of
the
elements
of
which
our
body
is
composed
and
of
the
substances
which
nature
appears
to
have
intended
to
repair
their

man

a
great

composed
both
of

on

feed
and
was
also
forced
to
look
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
for
affinities
susceptible
of
animalization
in
these
two
walks
the
most
praiseworthy
efforts
have
been
made
always
as
minute
as
possible
and
the
curious
have
followed
either
the
human
body
or
the
food
which
invigorates
it
first
to
their
secondary
principles
and
then
to
their
elements
beyond
which
we
have
not
been
permitted
to
penetrate
here
i
intended
to
have
given
a
little
treatise
on
alimentary
chemistry
and
to
tell
my
readers
to
how
many
thousands
of
hydrogen
carbon
may
be
reduced
the
dishes
that
sustain
us
i
did
not
do
so
however
because
i
remembered
i
would
only
have
to
copy
many
excellent
treatises
on
chemistry
in
the
hands
of
every
body
i
feared
too
that
i
would
relapse
into
very
barren
details
and
limited
myself
to
a
very
reasonable
nomenclature
which
will
only
require
the
explanation
of
a
small
number
of
very
usual
terms
osmazome
the
greatest
service
chemistry
has
rendered
to
alimentary
science
is
the
discovery
of
osmazome
or
rather
the
determination
of
what
it
was
osmazome
is
the
purely
sapid
portion
of
flesh
soluble
in
cold
water
and
separated
from
the
extractive
portion
which
is
only
soluble
in
boiling
water
osmazome
is
the
most
meritorious
ingredient
of
all
good
soups
this
portion
of
the
animal
forms
the
red
portion
of
flesh
and
the
solid
parts
of
roasts
it
gives
game
and
venison
its
peculiar
flavor
osmazome
is
most
abundant
in
grown
animals
which
have
red
or
black
hair
it
is
scarcely
found
at
all
in
the
lamb
sucking
pig
chicken
and
the
white
meat
of
the
largest
fowls
for
this
reason
true
connoisseurs
always
prefer
the
second
joint
instinct
with
them
was
the
precursor
of
science
thus
a
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
osmazome
caused
so
many
cooks
to
be
dismissed
who
insisted
on
always
throwing
away
the
first
bouillon
made
from
meat
this
made
the
reputation
of
the
soupe
des
primes
and
induced
the
canon
chevrier
to
invent
his
locked
kettles
the
abbe

the
person
who
never
would
eat

friday

had
not
been

unknown

maxim

may
be
considered
an

not
a

thing
as
it
contains
nearly
the

elements
as
sugar
vegetable
gelatine
extracted
from
many
kinds
of
fruits
especially
from
apples
quinces
and
some
others
may
also
be
considered
a
food
it
is
more
nutritious
when
united
with
sugar
but
it
is
far
inferior
in
that
respect
to
what
is
extracted
from
bones
horns
calves
feet
and
fish

is
in

therefore
dispute
about
it
difference
between
fat
and
lean
next
to
the

as
we
have
said
is
composed
of
asmazome

extractus
there
are
found
in

substances
which
also
exist
in
land
animals
such
as
fibrine
gelatine
albumen
so
that
we
may
really
say
juice
distinguishes
the
flesh
diet
from
what
the
church
calls
maigre
the
latter
too
has
another
peculiarity
fish
contains
a
large
quantity
of
phosphorus
and
hydrogen
that
is
to
say
of
the
two
most
combustible
things
in
nature
fish
therefore
is
a
most
heating
diet
this
might
legitimate
the
praise
once
bestowed
on
certain
religious
orders
the
regime
of
whom
was
directly
opposed
to
the
commonly
esteemed
most
fragile
individual
instance
i
will
say
no
more
on
this
physiological
fact
but
will
not
omit
an
instance
which
may
be
easily
verified
some
years
ago
i
went
to
a
country
house
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
and
on
the
seine
near
denis
near
a
hamlet
composed
chiefly
of
fishing
huts
i
was
amazed
at
the
crowd
of
huts
i
saw
swarming
in
the
road
i
remarked
it
with
amazement
to
the
boatman
who
took
me
across
the
river
monsieur
said
he
we
have
eight
families
here
have
three
children
among
whom
are
girls
and
four
boys
that
one
is
mine
as
he
spoke
he
pointed
triumphantly
to
a
little
whelp
of
about
five
years
of
age
who
was
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
eating
raw
from
this
observation
i
made
ten
years
ago
and
others
i
could
easily
recall
i
have
been
led
to
think
that
the
genesiac
sense
is
moved
by
and
that
it
is
rather
irritating
than
plethoric
and
substantial
i
am
inclined
to
maintain
this
opinion
the
more
because
doctor
bailly
has
recently
proved
by
many
instances
that
when
ever
the
number
of
female
children
exceeds
the
male
the
circumstance
is
due
to
some
debilitating
circumstances
this
will
account
to
us
for
the
jests
made
from
the
beginning
of
time
whenever
a
man
wife
bears
him
a
daughter
instead
of
a
son
i
might
say
much
about
aliments
considered
as
a
tout
ensemble
and
about
the
various
modifications
they
undergo
by
mixing
etc
i
hope
though
that
the
preceding
will
suffice
to
the
majority
of
readers
i
recommend
all
others
to
read
some
book
ex
professo
and
will
end
with
the
things
which
are
not
without
interest
the
first
is
that
animalization
is
affected
almost
as
vegetation
is
that
is
that
the
reparative
current
formed
by
digestion
is
inhaled
in
various
manners
by
the
tubes
with
which
the
organs
are
provided
and
becomes
flesh
nails
hair
precisely
as
earth
watered
by
the
same
fluid
becomes
radish
lettuce
potato
as
the
gardener
pleases
the
second
is
that
in
the
organization
of
life
the
same
elements
which
chemistry
produces
are
not
obtained
the
organs
destined
to
produce
life
and
motion
only
act
on
what
is
subjected
to
them

to
wrap
herself
in
veils
and
to
stop
us
at
every
advance

has
concealed
the
laboratory
where
new
transformations
are
affected
it
is
difficult
to
explain
how
having
determined
that
the
human
body
contained
lime
sulphur
and
phosphorous
iron
and
the
other

all
this
can
be

a
portion

to
serious

during
this
interval
of

much
of
my
matter
has
escaped
my
memory

been
wrested
from
me
elementary

have
been
put
into
the
hands

every

things

have
so
condensed
it
that
it
is
reduced
to
a
few
elementary
principles
to
theories
which
can
not
be
too
widely
propagated

to
sundry
observations

fruits
of

i

enrich

to
deck
our

quail

the
turkey
whenever
we
find
a
fowl
of
this
class
we
are
sure
to
find
too
light
aliment
full
of
flavor
and
just
as
fit
for
the
convalescent
as
for
the
man
of
the
most
robust
health
which
one
of
us
condemned
to
the
fare
of
the
fathers
of
the

would
not
have
smiled
at
the
idea
of
a
chicken
wing
announcing
his
rapid
rendition
to
civilized
life
we
are
not
satisfied
with
the
flavor
nature
has
given
to
gallinaceous
fowls
art
has
taken
possession
of
them
and
under
the
pretext
of
ameliorating
has
made
martyrs
of
them
they
have
not
only
been
deprived
of
the
means
of
reproduction
but
they
have
been
kept
in
solitude
and
darkness
and
forced
to
eat
until
they
were
led
to
an
unnatural
state
of
fatness
it
is
very
true
that
this
unnatural
grease
is
very
delicious
and
that
this
damnable
skill
gives
them
the
fineness
and
succulence
which
are
the
delight
of
our
best
tables
thus
ameliorated

the
turkey
the
turkey
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
glorious
presents
made
by
the
new
world
to
the
old
those
persons
who
always
wish
to
know
more
than
others
say
that
the
turkey
was
known
to
the
ancients
and
was
served
up
at
the
wedding
feast
of
charlemagne
they
say
it
is
an
error
to
attribute
the
importation
to
the
jesuits
to
these
paradoxes
but
two
things
can
be
opposed
the
name
of
the
bird
proves
its
origin
for
at
one
time
america
was
called
the
west
indies
the
form
of
the
bird
is
altogether
foreign
a
well
informed
man
can
not
be
mistaken
about
it
though
already
perfectly
satisfied
i
made
much
deep
research
in
the
matter
i
will
not
inflict
my
studies
on
my
readers
but
will
only
give
them
the
results
the
turkey
appeared
in
europe
about
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
it
was
imported
by
the
jesuits
who
sent
a
large
number
especially
to
a
farm
they
had
near
bouges
that
thence
they
spread
gradually
over
france
and
in
many
localities
a
turkey
to
this
day
is
called
a
jesuit
only
in
america
has
the
turkey
been
found
in
a
wild
state
it
is
unknown
in
africa
that
in
the
farms
of
north
america
where
it
is
very
common
it
has
two
origins
either
from
eggs
which
have
been
found
and
hatched
or
from
young
turkeys
caught
in
the
woods
the
consequence
is
they
are
in
a
state
of
nature
and
preserve
almost
all
their
original
plumage
overcome
by
this
evidence
i
bestow
on
the
good
fathers
a
double
portion
of
gratitude
for
they
imported
the
quinquina
yet
known
as
jesuit
bark
the
same
researches
informed
us
that
the
turkey
gradually
became
acclimated
in
france
well
informed
observers
have
told
me
that
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
of
twenty
young
turkeys
scarcely
ten
lived
while
now
fourteen
out
of
every
twenty

the
spring
rains
are
most
unfortunate

large

the
turkey
is
the
largest
and
if
not
the
finest
at
least
the
most
highly
flavored
of
the
gallinaceous
family
it
has
also
the
advantage
of
collecting
around
it
every
class
of
society
when
the
virgin
dresses
and
farmers
of
our

wish
to
regale
themselves

do
they
roast
before
the

of

which
the

when
the
mechanic
when
the

collects
a
few

to
enjoy
a
relief

is
the
more
grateful

public
fortune
and
occasioned
a
very
considerable
commerce
by
raising
turkeys
the
farmers
were
able
the
more

to
pay
their
rents
young
girls
often
acquired
a
very
sufficient
dowry
and
who
wished
to
eat
them
had
to
pay

them
in
a
purely
financial
point
of

turkeys
demand
much
attention
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
between
the
first
of
november
and
the
end
of
february
three
hundred
dindon

are
consumed
per
diem
the
sum
total
is
turkeys
the
price
of
every
turkey
in
that
condition
is
at
least
twenty
francs
and
the
sum
of
the
whole
is
not
less
than
francs
a
very
pretty
sum
of
money
one
must
add
a
similar
sum
for
the
fowls
pheasants
pullets
and
partridges

of
the
professor
while
i
was
living
at

i
was
lucky
enough
to
kill
a

complaisance

the

an

invited

he
also
permitted
me
to
bring
a
friend
or
two
if
i
pleased
one
fine
day
in
october
therefore
with
a
friend
i
set
out
with
the
hope
of
reaching
the
farm
of
bulow
five
mortal
leagues
from
hartford
before
night
though
the
road
was
hardly
traced
we
arrived
there
without
accident
and
were
received
with
that
cordial
hospitality
expressed
by
acts
for
before
we
had
been
five
minutes
on
the
farm
dogs
horses
and
men
were
all
suitably
taken
care
of
about
two
hours
were
consumed
in
the
examination
of
the
farm
and
its
dependencies
i
would
describe
all
this
if
i
did
not
prefer
to
display
to
the
reader
the
four
buxom
daughters
of
bulow
to
whom
our
arrival
was
a
great
event
their
ages
were
from
sixteen
to
and
there
was
so
much
simplicity
in
their
persons
so
much
activity
and
abandon
that
every
motion
seemed
full
of
grace
after
our
return
from
walking
we
sat
around
a
well
furnished
table
a
superb
piece
of
corned
beef
a
stewed
goose
and
a
magnificent
leg
of
mutton
besides
an
abundance
of
vegetables
and
two
large
jugs
of
cider
one
at
each
end
of
the
table
made
up
our
bill
of
fare
when
we
had
proven
to
our
host
that
in
appetite
at
least
we
were
true
huntsmen
we
began
to
make
arrangements
for
our
sport
he
told
us
where
we
would
find
game
and
gave
us
to
guide
us
on
our
return
not
forgetting
where
we
could
obtain
refreshments
during
this
conversation
the
ladies
had
prepared
excellent
tea
of
which
we
drank
several
cups
and
were
then
shown
into
a
room
with
two
beds
where
exercise
and
fatigue
procured
us
a
sound
sleep
on
the
next
day
we
set
out
rather
late
and
having
come
to
the
end
of
the
clearings
made
by
bulow
i
found
myself
in
a
virgin
forest
for
the
first
time
the
sound
of
the
axe
had
never
been
heard
there
i
walked
about
with
delight
observing
the
blessings
and
ravages
of
time
which
creates
and
destroys
and
i
amused
myself
by
tracing
all
the
periods
on
the
life
of
an
oak
since
the
moment
when
its
two
leaves
start
from
the
ground
until
it
leaves
but
a
long
black
mark
which
is
the
dust
of
its
heart
my
companion
king
reproached
me
for
my
moodiness
and
we
began
the
hunt
we
killed
first
some
of
those
pretty
grey
partridges
which
are
so
round
and
so
tender
we
then
knocked
down
six
or
seven
grey
squirrels
highly
esteemed
in
america
and
at
last
were
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
flock
of
turkeys
they
rose
one
after
the
other
flying
rapidly
and
crying
loudly
king
fired
on
the
first
and
ran
after
it
the
others
were
soon
out
of
shot
the
most
sluggish
of
all
arose
at
last
not
ten
paces
from
me
it
flew
through
an
opening
i
fired
and
it
fell
dead
one
must
be
a
sportsman
to
conceive
the
extreme
pleasure
this
shot
caused
me
i
siezed
on
the
superb
bird
and
turned
it
over
and
over
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
until
i
heard
my
companion
voice
calling
for
assistance
i
hurried
to
him
and
found
that
he
called
me
to
aid
him
in
looking
for
a
turkey
he
claimed
to
have
killed
but
which
had
disappeared
i
put
my
dog
on
the
scent
but
he
led
us
into
an
under
growth
so
thick
and
thorny
that
a
snake
could
scarcely
penetrate
it
i
had
then
to
give
up
the
search
and
my
companion
was
in
a
bad
humor
all
day
long
the
rest
of
the
day
scarcely
deserves
the
honors
of
printing
on
our
return
we
lost
ourselves
in
boundless
woods
and
we
were
in
not
a
little
danger
of
having
to
stay
out
all
night
when
the
silvery
tones
of
bulow
daughters
and
the
deep
bass
of
their
father
who
had
come
to
look
for
us
guided
us
home
the
four
sisters
were
fully
armed
with
clean
dresses
new
ribbons
pretty
hats
and
so
carefully
shod
that
it
was
evident
that
they
had
formed
a
high
opinion
of
us
i
tried
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
the
one
of
the
ladies
who
took
my
arm
a
thing
she
did
as
naturally
as
if
it
had
belonged
to
her
jure
conjugali
when
we
reached
the
farm
supper
was
ready
but
before
we
sat
down
to
the
table
we
drew
near
to
a
bright
and
brilliant
fire
which
had
been
lighted
for
us
though
the
season
did
not
indicate
that
such
a
a
precaution
was
necessary
we
found
it
very
comfortable
fatigued
as
we
were
and
were
rested
as
if
by
enchantment
this
custom
doubtless
comes
from
the
indians
who
always
have
a
fire
in
their
huts
it
may
be
this
is
a
tradition
of
francis
de
sales
who
said
that
fire
was
good
eleven
months
of
the
year
non
liquet
we
ate
as
if
we
were
famished
a
large
bowl
of
punch
enabled
us
to
finish
the
evening
and
a
conversation
which
our
host
made
perfectly
free
led
us
far
into
the
night
we
spoke
of
the
war
of
independence
in
which
bulow
footnote
the
bulow
of

is
none
other
than
lieut
bellows
of
the
connecticut
line
many
of
whose
relations
yet
remain
in
the
valley
of
the
connecticut
had
served
as
a
field
officer
of
de
la
fayette
who
every
day
becomes
greater
in
the
eyes
of
the
americans
who
always
designate
him
as
the
marquis
of
agriculture
which
at
that
time
enriched
the
united
states
and
finally
of
my
native
land
which
i
loved
the
more
because
i
was
forced
to
leave
it
when
wearied
of
conversation
the
father
would
say
to
his
eldest
daughter
maria
give
us
a
song
she
without
any
embarrassment
sung
the
american
national
airs
the
complaints
of
mary
stuart
and
of
andre
all
popular
in
america
maria
had
taken
a
few
lessons
and
in
that
remote
country
passed
for
a
virtuosa
her
singing
though
derived
its
charm
from
the
quality
of
her
voice
which
was
at
once
clear
fresh
and
accentuated
on
the
next
day
in
spite
of
bulow
persuasions
we
set
out
i
had
duties
to
discharge
and
while
the
horses
were
being
prepared
bulow
took
me
aside
and
used
these
remarkable
words
you
see
in
me
sir
a
happy
man
if
there
be
one
under
heaven
all
that
you
see
here
is
derived
from
my
own
property
my
stockings
were
knit
by
my
daughters
and
my
cloths
were
furnished
by
my
flocks
they
also
with
my
garden
furnish
me
with
an
abundance
of
healthy
food
the
greatest
eulogium
of
our
government
is
that
in
the
state
of
connecticut
there
are
a
thousand
farmers
as
well
satisfied
as
i
am
the
doors
of
whom
have
no
locks
taxes
are
almost
nothing
and
as
long
as
they
be
paid
any
one
can
sleep
calmly
congress
favors
national
industry
as
much
as
it
can
and
merchants
are
always
ready
to
take
from
us
whatever
we
wish
to
sell
i
have
ready
money
for
a
long
time
for
i
have
just
sold
at
dollars
a
barrel
flour
i
usually
receive
eight
for
all
this
is
derived
from
the
liberty
we
have
acquired
and
established
on
good
laws
i
am
master
of
my
own
house
and
you
will
not
be
astonished
when
you
know
that
we
never
fear
the
sound
of
the
drum
and
except
on
the
of
july
the
glorious
anniversary
of
our
independence
neither
soldiers
uniforms
nor
bayonets
are
seen
on
my
way
back
i
seemed
absorbed
by
profound
reflection
perhaps
the
reader
may
think
i
mused
on
my
host
parting
words
i
had
very
different
thoughts
however
for
i
was
studying
how
i
should
cook
my
turkey
i
was
in
some
trouble
for
i
feared
i
would
not
find
all
i
needed
at
hartford
and
wished
to
make
a
trophy
of
my
spolia
opima
i
make
a
painful
sacrifice
in
suppressing
the
details
of
the
profound
science
i
exhibited
in
the
preparation
of
an
entertainment
to
which
i
invited
several
friends
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
partridge
wings
were
served
en
papillote
and
the
grey
squirrels
stewed
in
madeira
the
turkey
which
was
our
only
roast
dish
was
charming
to
the
sight
flattering
to
the
sense
of
smell
and
delicious
to
taste
therefore
until
the
last
fragment
was
eaten
there
were
heard
around
the
table
very
good
exceedingly
good
dear
sir
what
a
nice
piece
footnote
the
flesh
of
the
wild
turkey
is
more
highly
colored
and
more
perfumed
than
the
domestic
fowl
i
am
glad
to
learn
that
my
amiable
colleague
bosc
had
killed
many
in
carolina
which
he
found
excellent
and
far
better
than
those
in
europe
he
therefore
recommends
that
they
be
allowed
the
largest
liberty
that
they
be
driven
into
the
woods
and
fields
to
enhance
the
flavor
and
bring
it
as
nearly
as
possible
back
to
the
original

by
game
we
mean
all
wild
animals
which
are
fit
to
eat
and
live
in
a
state
of
natural
liberty
we
say
fit
to
eat
because
many
animals
which
are
in
a
state
of
nature
are
not
fit
to
eat
such
as
foxes
crows

etc
they
are
called

vermin
game
is
divided
into
three
series
the
first
contains
all
birds
from
the
grive
to
the
smallest
of
the
feathered
tribe
the
second
ascends
from
the
rail
to
the
snipe
partridge
and
pheasant
including
the
rabbit
and
the
hare
it
is
divided
into
three
categories
of
the
marsh
hairy
and
feathered
the
third
which
bears
the
name
of
venison
is
composed
of
the
kid
and
all
other
cattle
game
is
one
of
the
great
luxuries
of
our
tables
it
is
a
healthy
warm
and
high
tasted
flesh
easily
digested
whenever
one
is
hungry
these
qualities
however
are
not
so
inherent
as
not
to
a
certain
degree
to
depend
on
the
skill
of
the
cook
put
some
water
salt
and
beef
into
a
pot
and
you
can
obtain
from
them
a
very
good
soup
substitute
venison
for
the
beef
and
the
result
will
not
be
fit
to
eat
butcher
meat
in
this
respect
has
the
advantage
under
the
manipulation
however
of
a
skilful
cook
game
undergoes
various
modifications
and
transformations
and
furnishes
the
greater
portions
of
the
dishes
of
the
transcendental
kitchen
game
derives
also
a
great
portion
of
its
value
from
the
soil
on
which
it
is
fed
the
taste
of
a
perigord
partridge
is
very
different
from
that
of
one
from
sologne
and
the
hare
killed
in
the
vicinity
of
paris
is
a
very
different
dish
from
one
shot
on
the
hills
of
valromey
or
upper
dauphiny
the
latter
is
probably
the
most
perfumed
of
all
beasts
among
small
birds
beyond
all
doubt
the
best
is
the
beccafico
it
becomes
at
least
as
fat
as
the
or
the
ortolan
and
nature
has
besides
given
it
a
slight
bitterness
and
a
peculiar
and
exquisite
perfume
which
enables
it
to
fill
and
delight
all
the
gustatory
organs
were
the
beccafico
as
large
as
a
pheasant
an
acre
of
land
would
be
paid
for
it
it
is
a
pity
this
bird
is
so
rare
that
few
others
than
those
who
live
in
the
southern
departments
of
france
know
what
it
is
footnote
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
bird
is
utterly
unknown

people
know
how
to
eat

birds
the

method
was
imparted
confidentially

me
by

a
gourmand

a

thirty

folly
is
committed
because
its
perfume
is
very
volatile

when
ever
in

its
flavor
is
dissolved
and
lost
the
snipe
is
a
charming
bird
but
few
people
know
all
its
charms
it
is
in
its
glory
only
when
it
has
been
cooked
under
the
huntsman
eyes
and
the
huntsman
must
have
killed
it

the
roast
is
perfected

should
be
placed

in
the
art
of
seasoning
fish
esteemed
it
very
highly
and
were
so
delicate
that
they
could
even
tell
where
it
had
been
taken
large
fish
ponds
were
maintained
and
the
cruelty
of
vellius
pollis
who
fed
his
lampreys
on
the
bodies
of
slaves
he
caused
to
be
slain
is
well
known
this
cruelty
domitian
disapproved
of
but
should
have
punished
there
has
been
much
discussion
as
to
which
is
the
best
fish
the
question
will
never
be
decided
for
as
the
spanish
proverb
says
sobre
los
gustos
no
hai
disputa
every
one
is
effected
in
his
own
way
these
fugitive
sensations
can
be
expressed
by
no
known
character
and
there
is
no
scale
to
measure
if
a
a
sole
or
a
turbot
are
better
than
a
salmon
trout
pike
or
even
tench
of
six
or
seven
pounds
it
is
well
understood
that
fish
is
less
nourishing
than
meat
because
it
contains
no
osmazome
because
it
is
lighter
in
weight
and
contains
less
weight
in
the
same
volume
and
especially
oysters
furnish
little
nutrition
so
that
one
can
eat
a
great
many
without
injury
it
will
be
remembered
that
not
long
ago
any
well
arranged
entertainment
began
with
oysters
and
that
many
guests
never
paused
without
swallowing
a
gross
i
was
anxious
to
know
the
weight
of
this
advance
guard
and
i
ascertained
that
a
dozen
oysters
fluid
included
weighed
four
ounces
averdupois
now
look
on
it
as
certain
that
the
same
persons
who
did
not
make
a
whit
the
worse
dinner
on
account
of
the
oysters
would
have
been
completely
satisfied
if
they
had
eaten
the
same
weight
of
flesh
or
of
chicken
anecdote
in
i
was
at
versailles
as
a
commissary
of
the
directory
and
frequently
met
laperte
greffier
of
the
count
of
the
department
he
was
very
fond
of
oysters
and
used
to
complain
that
he
had
never
had
enough
i
resolved
to
procure
him
this
satisfaction
and
invited
him
to
dine
with
me
on
the
next
day
he
came
i
kept
company
with
him
to
the
tenth
dozen
after
which
i
let
him
go
on
alone
he
managed
to
eat
dozen
within
an
hour
for
the
person
who
opened
them
was
not
very
skilful
in
the
interim
i
was
idle
and
as
that
is
always
a
painful
state
at
the
table
i
stopped
him
at
the
moment
when
he
was
in
full
swing
mon
cher
said
i
you
will
not
eat
as
many
oysters
as
you
meant
let
us
dine
we
did
so
and
he
acted
as
if
he
had
fasted
for
a
week
the
ancients
extracted
from
fish
two
highly
flavored
seasonings
muria
and
garum
the
first
was
the
juice
of
the
thuny
or
to
speak
more
precisely
the
liquid
substance
which
salt
causes
to
flow
from
the
fish
garum
was
dearer
and
we
know
much
less
of
it
it
is
thought
that
it
was
extracted
by
pressure
from
the
entrailles
of
the
scombra
or
mackerel
but
this
supposition
does
not
account
for
its
high
price
there
is
reason
to
believe
it
was
a
foreign
sauce
and
was
nothing
else
but
the
indian
soy
which
we
know
to
be
only
fish
fermented
with
mushrooms
certainly
people
from
their
locality
are
forced
to
live
almost
entirely
upon
fish
they
also
feed
their
working
animals
with
it
and
the
latter
from
custom
gradually
grow
to
like
this
strange
food
they
also
manure
the
soil
with
it
yet
always
receive
the
same
quantity
from
the
sea
which
surrounds
them
it
has
been
observed
that
such
nations
are
not
so
courageous
as
those
that
eat
flesh
they
are
pale
a
thing
not
surprising
for
the
elements
of
fish
must
rather
repair
the
lymph
than
the
blood
among
ichthyophages
remarkable
instances
of
longevity
are
observed
either
because
light
food
preserves
them
from
plethora
or
that
the
juices
it
contains
being
formed
by
nature
only
to
constitute
cartilages
which
never
bears
long
duration
their
use
retards
the
solidification
of
the
parts
of
the
body
which
after
all
is
the
cause
of
death
be
this
as
it
may
fish
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
cook
is
an
inexhaustible
source
of
enjoyment
it
is
served
up
whole
in
pieces
truncated
with
water
oil
vinegar
warm
cold
and
is
always
well
received
it
is
however
never
better
than
when
dressed
en
matilotte
this
ragout
though
made
a
necessary
dish
to
the
boatmen
on
our
rivers
and
made
in
perfection
only
by
the
keepers
of
cobarets
on
their
banks
is
incomparably
good
lovers
of
fish
never
see
it
without
expressing
their
gratification
either
on
account
of
its
freshness
of
taste
or
because
they
can
without
difficulty
eat
an
indefinite
quantity
without
any
fear
of
satiety
or
indigestion
analytical
gastronomy
has
sought
to
ascertain
what
are
the
effects
of
a
fish
diet
on
the
animal
system
unanimous
observation
leads
us
to
think
that
it
has
great
influence
on
the
genesiac
sense
and
awakens
the
instinct
of
reproduction
in
the
two
sexes
this
effect
being
once
known
two
causes
were
at
once
assigned
for
it
the
different
manner
of
preparing
fish
all
the
seasoning
for
it
being
irritating
such
as
carar
hering
thon
marine
etc
the
various
juices
the
fish
imbibes
which
are
highly
inflammable
and
oxigenise
in
digestion
profound
analysis
has
discovered
a
yet
more
powerful
cause
the
presence
of
phosphorous
in
all
the
portions
and
which
decomposition
soon
developes
these
physical
truths
were
doubtless
unknown
to
the
ecclesiastical
legislators
who
imposed
the
lenten
diet
on
different
communities
of
monks
such
as
chartreux
recollets
trappists
and
the
carmelites
reformed
by
saint
theresa
no
one
thinks
that
they
wished
to
throw
a
new
difficulty
into
the
way
of
the
observance
of
the
already
most
vow
of
chastity
in
this
state
of
affairs
beyond
doubt
glorious
victories
were
won
and
rebellious
senses
were
subjected
there
were
however
many
lapses
and
defeats
they
must
have
been
well
averred
for
the
result
was
the
religious
orders
had
ultimately
a
reputation
like
that
of
hercules
and
the
daughters
of
danaus
or
marshal
saxe
with
lecouvreur
they
might
also
have
been
delighted
by
an
anecdote
so
old
as
to
date
from
the
crusades
sultan
saladin
being
anxious
to
measure
the
continence
of
devises
took
two
into
his
palace
and
for
a
long
time
fed
them
on
the
most
succulent
food
soon
all
traces
of
fasting
began
to
disappear
and
they
reached
a
very
comfortable
embonpoint
at
that
time
they
were
given
as
companions
two
odalisques
of
great
beauty
all
of
whose
directed
attacks
failed
and
they
came
from
the
ordeal
pure
as
the
diamond
of
visapor
the
sultan
kept
them
in
his
palace
and
to
celebrate
their
triumph
fed
them
for
several
weeks
on
fish
alone
after
a
few
days
they
were
again
submitted
to
the
ordeal
of
the
odalisques
and
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
it
is
probable
that
if
the
course
of
events
were
to
establish
any
monastic
order
the
superiors
would
adopt
some
regimen
better
calculated
to
maintain
its
objects
philosophical
reflection
fish
considered
in
general
is
an
inexhaustible
source
of
reflection
to
the
philosopher
the
varied
forms
of
these
strange
animals
the
senses
they
are
deprived
of
and
the
limited
nature
of
those
they
have
their
various
modes
of
existence
the
influence
exerted
over
them
by
the
medium
in
which
they
live
move
and
breathe
extend
the
range
of
our
ideas
and
the
indefinite
modifications
which
result
from
their
nature
motions
and
lives
for
my
part
i
entertain
to
them
a
sentiment
very
like
respect
resulting
from
my
belief
that
they
belong
to
antediluvian
races
the
great
convulsion
which
doomed
our
ancestors
in
the
eighteenth
century
of
the
world
to
fish
was
a
season
of
joy
triumph
and
festivity
section
vii
truffles
who
ever
says
truffle
pronounces
a
great
word
which
awakens
eratic
and
gourmand
ideas
both
in
the
sex
dressed
in
petticoats
and
in
the
bearded
portion
of
humanity
this
honorable
duplication
results
from
the
fact
that
the
tubercle
is
not
only
delicious
to
the
taste
but
that
it
excites
a
power
the
exercise
of
which
is
accompanied
by
the
most
delicious
pleasures
the
origin
of
the
truffle
is
unknown
they
are
found
but
none
know
how
they
vegetate
the
most
learned
men
have
sought
to
ascertain
the
secret
and
fancied
they
discovered
the
seed
their
promises
however
were
vain
and
no
planting
was
ever
followed
by
a
harvest
this
perhaps
is
all
right
for
as
one
of
the
great
values
of
truffles
is
their
dearness
perhaps
they
would
be
less
highly
esteemed
if
they
were
cheaper
rejoice
my
friend
said
i
a
superb
lace
is
about
to
be
manufactured
at
a
very
low
price
ah
replied
she
think
you
if
it
be
cheap
that
any
one
would
wear
it
eratic
virtue
of
truffles
the
romans
were
well
acquainted
with
the
truffle
but
i
do
not
think
they
were
acquainted
with
the
french
variety
those
which
were
their
delight
were
obtained
from
greece
and
africa
and
especially
from
libia
the
substance
was
pale
tinged
with
rose
and
the
libian
truffles
were
sought
for
as
being
far
the
most
delicate
and
highly
perfumed
gustus
elementa
per
omnia
quaerunt
juvenal
from
the
romans
to
our
own
time
there
was
a
long
interregnum
and
the
resurrection
of
truffles
is
an
event
of
recent
occurrence
i
have
read
many
old
books
in
which
there
is
no
allusion
to
them
the
generation
for
which
i
write
may
almost
be
said
to
witness
its
resurrection
about
truffles
were
very
rare
in
paris
and
they
were
to
be
had
only
in
small
quantities
at
the
hotel
des
americans
and
at
the
hotel
de
province
a
dindon
truffee
was
a
luxury
only
seen
at
the
tables
of
great
nobles
and
of
kept
women
we
owe
their
abundance
to
dealers
in
comestibles
the
number
of
whom
has
greatly
increased
and
who
seeing
that
their
merchandise
was
popular
had
it
sought
for
throughout
the
kingdom
sending
for
it
by
either
the
mail
or
by
couriers
they
made
its
search
general
as
truffles
can
not
be
planted
careful
search
alone
can
obtain
it
at
the
time
i
write
the
glory
of
the
truffle
is
at
its
apogee
let
no
one
ever
confess
that
he
dined
where
truffles
were
not
however
good
any
entree
may
be
it
seems
bad
unless
enriched
by
truffles
who
has
not
felt
his
mouth
water
when
any
allusion
was
made
to
truffles
a
la
provincale
a
saute
of
truffles
is
a
dish
the
honors
of
which
the
mistress
of
the
house
reserves
to
herself
in
fine
the
truffle
is
the
diamond
of
the
kitchen
i
sought
the
reason
of
this
preference
it
seemed
to
me
that
many
other
substances
had
an
equal
right
to
the
honor
and
i
became
satisfied
that
the
cause
was
that
the
truffle
was
supposed
to
excite
the
genesiac
sense
this
i
am
sure
is
the
chief
quality
of
its
perfection
and
the
predilection
and
preference
evinced
for
it
so
powerful
is
our
servitude
to
this
tyrannical
and
capricious
sense
this
discovery
led
me
to
seek
to
ascertain
if
the
effect
were
real
or
imaginary
the
translator
here
has
thought
it
best
to
omit
a
very
broad
dialogue
which
introduced
into
his
book
i
made
ulterior
researches
collected
my
ideas
and
consulted
the
men
who
were
most
likely
to
know
with
all
of
whom
i
was
intimate
i
united
them
into
a
tribunal
a
senate
a
sanhedrim
an
areopagus
and
we
gave
the
following
decision
to
be
commented
upon
by
the
litterateures
of
the
century
the
truffle
is
a
positive
aphrodisiac
and
under
certain
circumstances
makes
women
kinder
and
men
more
amiable
in
piedmont
white
truffles
are
met
with
which
are
very
highly
esteemed
they
have
a
slight
flavor
not
injurious
to
their
perfection
because
it
gives
no
disagreable
return
the
best
truffles
of
france
come
from
perigord
and
upper
provence
about
the
month
of
january
they
have
their
highest
perfume
those
from
bugey
also
have
a
high
flavor
but
can
not
be
preserved
those
of
burgundy
and
dauphiny
are
of
inferior
quality
they
are
hard
and
are
deficient
in
farinacious
matter
thus
there
are
many
kinds
of
truffles
to
find
truffles
dogs
and
hogs
are
used
that
have
been
trained
to
the
purpose
there
are
men
however
with
such
practised
eyes
that
by
the
inspection
of
the
soil
they
can
say
whether
it
contains
truffles
or
not
and
what
is
their
quality
are
truffles
indigestibles
we
have
only
to
ascertain
if
the
truffle
be
indigestible
or
not
we
say
no
this
decision
is
ex
cathedra
and
well
sustained
by
the
nature
of
the
substance
the
truffle
is
easily
masticated
is
light
and
has
nothing
hard
nor
cartilaginous
in
its
composition
during
our
observations
for
fifty
years
we
have
never
known
any
indigestion
to
result
from
truffles
footnote
the
translator
has
known
several
such
indigestions
he
once
nearly
became
a
martyr
to
a
galatine
de
perdrix
truffee
at
the
restaurant
of
the
late
m
dandurand
the
attestation
of
the
most
eminent
of
the
faculty
of
paris
a
city
eminently
gourmande
and
trufflivorous
sustains
this
idea
from
the
daily
conduct
of
the
doctors
of
the
law
who
caeteris
paribus
consume
more
truffles
than
any
other
class
of
citizens
doctor
malonet
used
to
eat
enough
to
give
an
elephant
the
indigestion
he
however
lived
to
be
we
may
therefore
look
on
it
as
certain
that
the
truffle
is
a
food
healthy
as
it
is
agreeable
and
that
when
taken
in
moderation
it
passes
through
the
system
as
a
letter
does
through
the
post
office
one
may
easily
be
indisposed
after
a
great
dinner
where
other
things
than
truffles
have
been
eaten
such
accidents
however
only
happen
to
those
who
after
the
first
service
were
already
stuffed
like
canons
and
who
failed
in
the
second
leaving
the
luxuries
offered
them
untouched
this
is
not
then
the
fault
of
truffles
and
we
may
be
sure
they
had
swallowed
so
many
glasses
of
pure
water
or
eaten
the
same
number
of
potatoes
let
us
conclude
by
a
circumstance
which
shows
how
easily
we
may
be
mistaken
without
careful
observation
one
day
i
invited
s
a
very
pleasant
old
man
to
dine
with
me
he
was
also
a
gourmand
of
the
highest
grade
either
because
i
knew
his
tastes
or
to
satisfy
all
my
guests
that
i
wished
to
make
them
happy
i
was
not
sparing
in
truffles
and
they
appeared
under
the
egis
of
young
turkeys
most
carefully
stuffed
s
ate
with
energy
and
as
i
knew
he
could
not
injure
himself
i
left
him
alone
persuading
him
not
to
hurry
himself
because
no
one
would
attack
the
property
he
had
acquired
all
passed
off
very
well
and
we
separated
at
a
very
late
hour
when
we
reached
home
however
s
was
attacked
by
a
violent
cholic
a
disposition
to
vomit
convulsive
cramp
and
general
indisposition
this
state
of
things
lasted
some
time
and
all
said
he
suffered
from
the
indigestion
caused
by
truffles
at
last
nature
came
to
the
patient
aid
and
s
opened
his
mouth
and
threw
up
a
single
truffle
which
struck
the
wall
and
rebounded
luckily
without
injury
to
the
all
unpleasant
symptoms
at
once
disappeared
tranquility
was
restored
digestion
recommenced
its
course
the
patient
went
to
sleep
and
awoke
in
the
morning
perfectly
well
the
cause
was
easily
understood
s
had
been
eating
a
long
time
and
his
teeth
were
unable
to
sustain
the
labor
imposed
on
them
he
had
lost
many
of
those
precious
members
and
those
he
had
left
did
not
always
meet
together
a
truffle
had
thus
escaped
mastication
and
almost
whole
had
been
swallowed
digestion
had
carried
it
to
the
pylorus
where
it
was
momentarily
detained
and
this
mechanical
detention
had
caused
all
his
trouble
as
expulsion
had
cured
it
thus
there
was
no
indigestion
but
merely
the
interposition
of
a
foreign
body
this
was
decided
on
by
the
consulting
body
which
saw
the
corpus
delicti
and
which
selected
me
as
its
reporter
s
did
not
on
this
account
remain
a
whit
less
fond
of
truffles
he

sugar
in
the
present
state
of
science
we
understand
by
sugar
a
substance
mild
to
the
taste
crystalizable
and
which
by
fermentation
resolves
itself
into
carbonic
acid
and
alcohol
by

once
was
understood
only
the
crystalized
juice
of
the
cane
arundo
saccharifera
a
few
pages
of
old
authors
would
induce
us
to
think
the
ancients
had
observed
in
certain
arundines
a

and
extractible
portion

advanced
to
accomplish

sugar
really
originated
in
the
colonies
of
the
new

the
cane
was
imported
thither
two
centuries
ago
and
prospered
and
effort
was
made
to
utilize
the
juice
which
flowed
from
it
and
by
gradual
experiments
they
accomplished
the
manufacture
of
all
the
variety
of
its
productions

of
the

it
is
a

to

also
to
the

having
made
sugar
scarce
and
consequently
dear
the
government
made
it
an
object
for
savants
to
look
for
it
the
idea
was
successful
and
it
was
ascertained
that
sugar
was
found
in
the
whole
vegetable
kingdom
that
it
existed
in
the
grape
chestnut
potato
and
in
the

especially
this
last
plant
became
an
object
of

proved
that
in
this
respect
the
old
world
could
do
without
the
new
france
was
covered
with
manufactories
which
worked
with
different
success
and
the
manufacture
of
sugar
became
naturalized
the
art
was
a
new
one
which
may
any
day
be
recalled
among
the
various
manufactories
the
most
prominent
was
that
established
at
passy
near

by

a
citizen
the
name
of
whom
is
always
connected
with
the
good
and
useful
by
means
of
a
series
of
extensive
operations
he
got
rid
of
all
that
was
doubtful
in
the
practice
and
made
no
mystery
of
his
plan
of
procedure
even
to
those
who
were
his
rivals
he
was
visited
by
the
head
of
the
government
and
was
ordered
to
furnish
all
that
was
needed
at
the
tuilleries
new
circumstances
the
restoration
of

having
again
reduced
colonial
sugar
to
a
lower
price
the
french
manufacturers
lost
the
advantages
they
had
gained
many
however
yet
prosper
and
delassert
makes
some
thousands
every
year
this
also
enables
him
to
preserve
his
processes
until
the
time
comes
when
they
may
again
he
useful
footnote
we
may
add
that
at
the
session
for
the
general
encouragement
of

a

was
ordered
to
be
presented
to
crespel
a
manufacturer
of

who
manufactures
every

one

fifty
thousand
pounds
of

sugar
which
he
sells
at
a
profit
even
when

the
reason
is
that
the
refuse
is
used
for
distillation
and
subsequently
fed
out
to
cattle
when
beet
sugar
was
in
the
market
party
men
and
fools
took
it
into
their
heads
that
its
flavor
was
unpleasant
and
some
even
said
it
was
unhealthy
many
experiments
have
proved
the
contrary
and
the
count
de

there
was
a

like

to

said
that

that

ix
origin
of
coffee
the
first
coffee
tree
was
found
in
arabia
and
in
spite
of
the
various
transplantations
it
has
undergone
the
best
coffee
is
yet
obtained
there
an
old
tradition
states
that
coffee
was
discovered
by
a
shepherd
of
old
who
saw
that
his
flock
was
always
in
the
greatest
state
of
excitement
and
hilarity
when
they
browsed
on
the
leaves
of
the
coffee
tree
though
this
may
be
but
an
old
story
the
honor
of
the
discovery
belongs
only
in
part
to
the
the
rest
belongs
to
him
who
first
made
use
of
the
bean
and
boiled
it
a
mere
decoction
of
green
coffee
is
a
most
insipid
drink
but
carbonization
develops
the
aroma
and
forms
an
oil
which
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
coffee
we
drink
and
which
would
have
been
eternally
unknown
but
for
the
intervention
of
heat
the
turks
excel
us
in
this
they
employ
no
mill
to
torturate
the
coffee
but
beat
it
with
wooden
pestles
in
mortars
when
the
pestles
have
been
long
used
they
become
precious
and
are
sold
at
great
prices
i
had
to
examine
and
determine
whether
in
the
result
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
methods
be
preferable
consequently
i
burned
carefully
a
pound
of
good
mocha
and
separated
it
into
two
equal
portions
the
one
of
which
was
passed
through
the
mill
and
the
other
beaten
turkish
fashion
in
a
mortar
i
made
coffee
of
each
taking
equal
weights
of
each
poured
on
an
equal
weight
of
boiling
water
and
treated
them
both
precisely
alike
i
tasted
this
coffee
myself
and
caused
others
who
were
competent
judges
to
do
so
the
unanimous
opinion
was
that
coffee
which
had
been
beaten
in
a
mortar
was
far
better
than
that
which
had
been
ground
any
one
may
repeat
the
experiment
in
the
interim
i
will
tell
you
a
strange
anecdote
of
the
influence
of
one
or
the
other
kind
of
manipulation
monsieur
said
napoleon
one
day
to
laplace
how
comes
it
that
a
glass
of
water
into
which
i
put
a
lump
of
loaf
sugar
tastes
more
pleasantly
than
if
i
had
put
in
the
same
quantity
of
crushed
sugar
sire
said
the
philosophic
senator
there
are
three
substances
the
constituents
of
which
are
identical
sugar
gum
and
amidon
they
differ
only
in
certain
conditions
the
secret
of
which
nature
has
preserved
i
think
it
possible
that
in
the
effect
produced
by
the
pestle
some
saccharine
particles
become
either
gum
or
amidon
and
cause
the
difference
this
remark
became
public
and
ulterior
observations
has
confirmed
it
different
modes
of
preparing
coffee
some
years
ago
all
directed
their
attention
to
the
mode
of
preparing
coffee
the
reason
doubtless
was
that
the
head
of
the
government
was
fond
of
it
some
proposed
not
to
burn
nor
to
powder
it
to
boil
it
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
strain
it
i
have
tried
this
and
all
the
methods
which
have
been
suggested
from
day
to
day
and
prefer
that
known
as
a
la
dubelloy
which
consists
in
pouring
boiling
water
on
coffee
placed
in
a
porcelain
or
silver
vessel
pierced
with
a
number
of
very
minute
holes
this
first
decoction
should
be
taken
and
brought
to
the
boiling
point
then
passed
through
the
strainer
again
and
a
coffee
will
be
obtained
clear
and
strong
as
possible
i
have
also
tried
to
make
coffee
in
a
high
pressure
boiling
apparatus
all
i
obtained
however
was
a
fluid
intensely
bitter
and
strong
enough
to
take
the
skin
from
the
throat
of
a
cossack
effects
of
coffee
doctors
have
differed
in
relation
to
the
sanitary
properties
of
coffee
we
will
omit
all
this
and
devote
ourselves
to
the
more
important
point
its
influence
on
the
organs
of
thought
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
coffee
greatly
excites
the
cerebral
faculties
any
man
who
drinks
it
for
the
first
time
is
almost
sure
to
pass
a
sleepless
night
sometimes
the
effect
is
softened
or
modified
by
custom
but
there
are
many
persons
on
whom
it
always
produces
this
effect
and
who
consequently
can
not
use
coffee
i
have
said
that
the
effect
was
modified
by
use
a
circumstance
which
does
not
prevent
its
having
effect
in
another
manner
i
have
observed
persons
whom
coffee
did
not
prevent
from
sleeping
at
night
need
it
to
keep
them
awake
during
the
day
and
never
failed
to
slumber
when
they
had
taken
it
for
dinner
there
are
others
who
are

day
when
they
have
not
taken
their

voltaire
and
buffon
used
a
great
deal
of
coffee
perchance
the
latter
was
indebted
to
it
for
the
admirable
clearness
we
observe
in
his
works
and
the
second
for
the
harmonious
enthusiasm
of
his
style
it
is
evident
that
many
pages
of
the
treatise
on
man
the
dog
the
tiger
lion
and
horse
were
written
under
a
strange
cerebral
excitement
the
loss
of
sleep
caused
by
coffee
is
not
painful
for
the
perceptions
are
very
clear
and
one
has
no
disposition
to
sleep
one
is
always
excited
and
unhappy
when
wakefulness
comes
from
any
other
cause
this
however
does
prevent
such
an
excitement
when
carried
too
far
from
being
very
injurious
formerly
only
persons
of
mature
age
took
coffee
now
every
one
takes
it
and
perhaps
it
is
the
taste
which
forces
onward
the
immense
crowd
that
besiege
all
the
avenues
of
the
olympus
and
of
the
temple
of

the
cordwainer
author
of
the
tragedy
of

all

heard

years
ago
drank
much
coffee

that
reason
he
excelled

cabinetmaker
of

was

a
drunkard
coffee
is
a
more
powerful
fluid
than

generally
think

health
may
drink
two
bottles
of

a
day

a
long
time
and
sustain
his

if
he
drank
that
quantity
of
coffee
he
would
become
imbecile

die
of

i
saw
at

a
man

coffee
had
made
a
cripple
he
had
ceased
to
suffer
and
then
drank

should
make

people

are
not

one
of
those
who
have
been
obliged
to
give
up

the

called
on

for
an
opinion
about

wished
to
be
careful
and
for
which
he
had
allowed
me
but
a
very
short
time
i
determined
then
to
sit
up
all
night
and
to
enable
me
to
do
so
took
two
large
cups
of
strong
and
highly
flavored
coffee
i
went
home
at
seven
to
get
the
papers
which
had
been
promised
me
but
found
a
note
telling
me
i
would
not
get
them
until
the
next
day
thus
in
every
respect
disappointed
i
returned
to
the
house
where
i
had
dined
and
played
a
game
of
piquet
without
any
of
the
moody
fits
to
which
i
was
ordinarily
subject
i
did
justice
to
the
coffee
but
i
was
not
at
ease
as
to
how
i
would
pass
the
night
i
went
to
bed
at
my
usual
hour
thinking
that
if
i
did
not
get
my
usual
allowance
i
would
at
least
get
four
or
five
hours
sufficient
to
carry
me
through
the
day
i
was
mistaken
i
had
been
two
hours
in
bed
and
was
wider
awake
than
ever
i
was
in
intense
mental
agitation
and
fancied
my
brain
a
mill
the
wheels
of
which
revolved
grinding
nothing
the
idea
came
to
me
to
turn
this
fancy
to
account
and
i
did
so
amusing
myself
by
putting
into
verse
a
story
i
had
previously
read
in
an
english
paper
i
did
so
without
difficulty
and
as
i
did
not
sleep
i
undertook
another
but
in
vain
a
dozen
verses
had
exhausted
my
poetic
faculty
and
i
gave
it
up
i
passed
the
night
without
sleep
and
without
even
being
stupified
for
a
moment
i
arose
and
passed
the
day
in
the
same
manner
when
on
the
next
night
i
went
to
bed
at
my
usual
hour
i
made
a
calculation
and
found
out
that
i
had
not
slept
for
forty
hours

in

economy
was

unborn
the
spaniards
found
then
the
precious

an
almost
sterile
discovery
for
they
decreased

abundant
we
have
other
and
better
ways
to
increase

in
those
regions
however
where
a
genial
sun
confers
immense
fruitfulness
on
the
soil
the
cultivation
of
sugar
and
coffee
was
found
advantageous
the

indigo
vanilla
guano
cocoa
were
also
discovered
these

its

if
these

took
place
in

of
the
barriers
opposed
to
curiosity
by
a
jealous
nation
we
may
reasonably
hope
that
they
will
be
multiplied
in
the

of
the
years
to
come
and
that
the
explorations
of
the

of

will
enrich
the

with
a
multitude

which
will
give

call
chocolate
the

burnt
with
sugar

the
bark
of
the

this
is
the
technical

sugar
is
the

for

the
compound
is
cocoa
and

thus
is
obtained
the

the

tree
is
a
native
of
south
america

is
found
both
in
the
islands

on
the
continent
it
has
been
confessed

that
the
best

is
produced
by
the
trees
which
grow
on
the
banks
of
moracaibo
in
the
valleys
of
caracas
and
in
the
province
of
sokomusko
the
fruit
is
larger
the
sugar
less
bitter
and
the
taste
higher
since
these
regions
have
become
accessible
a
comparison
may
be
made
every
day
and
the
palate
will
never
be
deceived
the
spanish
women
of
the
new
world
are
passionately
fond
of
chocolate
and
not
satisfied
with
taking
it
two
or
three
times
a
day
have
it
even
sent
after
them
to
church
this
sensuality
has
often
drawn
down
the
censure
of
their
bishops
who
however
gradually
closed
their
eyes
to
it
the
reverend
father
escobar
the
metaphysics
of
whom
was
subtle
as
his
morals
were
accommodating
used
to
declare
that
chocolate
made
with
water
did
not
break
a
fast
thus
for
the
use
of
his
penitents
reproducing
the
old
adage
liquidum
non
frangit
jejunium
chocolate
was
brought
to
spain
about
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
use
became
at
once
common
women
especially
showed
great
fondness
for
it
manners
have
not
changed
in
this
particular
as
yet
and
now
throughout
all
the
peninsula
chocolate
is
presented
on
all
occasions
when
it
is
usual
to
offer
any
refreshment
chocolate
crossed
the
mountains
with
anne
of
austria
the
daughter
of
philip
and
wife
of
louis

the
spanish
monks
also
made
it
known
by
presents
to
their
brethren
in
france
the
spanish
ambassadors
also
made
it
popular
and
during
the
regency
it
was
more
universally
used
than
coffee
because
it
was
taken
as
an
agreeable
food
while
coffee
was
esteemed
a
luxury
linnaeus
calls
the
cocoa
cacao
theobroma
cocoa
the
drink
of
the

a
cause
for
this
name
has
been
sought
some
assign
his
passionate
fondness
for
it
and
the
other
his
desire
to
please
his
confessor
there
are
those
who
attribute
it
to
gallantry
a
queen
having
first
introduced
it
incertum
properties
of
chocolate
chocolate
has
given
occasion
to
profound
dissertations
with
the
object
of
determining
its
nature
and
properties
and
to
place
it
in
the
category
of
warm
cold
or
temperate
drinks
we
must
own
all
their
lucubrations
have
contributed
but
slightly
to
the
elucidation
of
truth
it
was
left
for
time
and
experience
those
two
great
masters
to
show
that
chocolate
prepared
with
care
is
as
healthful
as
it
is
agreeable
that
it
is
nourishing
easily
digested
and
is
not
so
injurious
to
beauty
as
coffee
said
to
be
it
is
very
suitable
to
persons
who
have
much
mental
toil
to
professors
and
lawyers
especially
to
lawyers
it
also
suits
certain
feeble
stomachs
and
has
been
thought
most
advantageous
in
chronic
diseases
it
is
the
last
resource
in
affections
of
the
pylorus
these
various
properties
chocolate
owes
to
nothing
but
an
eloesaccharum
few
substances
contain
in
the
same
volume
more
nutrition
it
becomes
almost
entirely
animalised
during
the
war
cocoa
was
rare
and
very
dear
substitutes
were
sought
for
but
all
efforts
were
vain
one
of
the
blessings
of
peace
was
that
it
rid
us
of
all
those
humbugs
one
was
forced
to
taste
but
which
were
no
more
chocolate
than
chicory
is
mocha
some
persons
complain
that
they
can
not
digest
chocolate
others
say
that
it
does
not
nourish
them
and
that
it
passes
away
too
quickly
the
probability
is
that
the
first
have
only
to
blame
themselves
and
that
the
chocolate
they
use
is
of
bad
quality
good
and
well
made
chocolate
can
be
digested
even
by
the
weakest
stomach
the
others
have
an
easy
remedy
and
they
need
only
strengthen
their
stomachs
by
a
pate
a
cotelette
or
a
jerked
kidney
then
let
them
take
a
bowl
of
sokomusko
and
thank
god
for
such
a
powerful
stomach
here
i
have
an
opportunity
to
give
two
examples
the
correctness
of
which
may
be
relied
on
after
a
good
breakfast
one
may
drink
a
full
bowl
of
chocolate
and
digestion
in
three
hours
will
be
perfect
so
that
one
may
dine
at
any
hour
that
is
pleasant
in
zeal
for
the
advancement
of
the
science
i
tried
this
experiment
on
many
ladies
who
assured
me
they
would
die
they
did
not
though
and
lived
to
glorify
the
professor
those
who
use
chocolate
ordinarily
enjoy
the
most
perfect
health
and
are
the
least
subject
to
the
multitude
of
ailments
which
destroy
life
their
embonpoint
is
stationary
these
two
examples
any
one
can
verify
in
society
by
a
scrutiny
of
those
the
regimen
of
whom
is
known
this
is
the
true
place
to
speak
of
the
properties
of
chocolate
which
i
have
verified
by
many
examples
and
experiments
which
i
am
delighted
to
exhibit
to
my
readers
see
varieties
at
the
end
of
the
volume
now
then
let
any
man
who
has
indulged
too
much
in
the
cup
of
volupte
let
every
man
who
has
passed
in
toil
too
much
of
the
time
when
he
should
have
slept
let
every
man
of
mind
who
finds
his
faculties
temporarily
decay
every
man
who
finds
the
air
humid
and
the
atmosphere
painful
to
breathe
let
every
man
who
has
a
fixed
idea
which
would
deprive
him
of
the
liberty
of
thought
let
them
each
take
a
demi
litre
of
chocolate
ambre
sixty
grains
of
amber
to
the
kilogramme
and
they
will
see
wonders
in
my
way
of
distinguishing
things
i
have
called
this
chocolate
des
affliges
because
in
all
the
conditions
i
have
referred
to
there
is
something
very
like
affliction
very
good
chocolate
is
made
in
spain
one
is
indisposed
to
send
thither
for
it
for
all
manufacturers
are
not
equally
skillful
and
when
it
comes
it
has
to
be
used
as
it
is
italian
chocolates
do
not
suit
the
french
for
the
cocoa
is
burned
too
much
this
makes
the
chocolate
bitter
and
deprives
it
of
its
nourishment
a
portion
of
the
bean
has
been
reduced
to
carbon
chocolate
having
become
common
in
france
all
sought
to
learn
how
to
make
it
few
however
approximated
to
perfection
for
the
art
is
not
easy
in
the
first
place
it
was
necessary
to
know
good
cocoa
and
to
use
it
in
all
its
purity
there
is
no
first
quality
case
that
has
not
its
inferiorities
and
a
mistaken
interest
often
causes
damaged
beans
to
be
put
in
which
should
have
been
rejected
the
roasting
of
the
cocoa
is
also
a
delicate
operation
and
requires
a
tact
very
like
inspiration
some
have
the
faculty
naturally
and
are
never
mistaken
a
peculiar
talent
is
necessary
to
regulate
the
quantity
of
sugar
which
enters
into
the
composition
it
is
not
invariable
and
a
matter
of
course
but
varies
in
proportion
to
the
aroma
of
the
bean
and
the
degree
of
torrefaction
the
trituration
and
mixture
do
not
demand
less
care
and
on
them
depends
the
greater
or
less
digestibility
of
chocolate
other
considerations
should
also
preside
over
the
choice
and
quantity
of
aromas
which
should
not
be
the
same
with
chocolate
made
for
food
and
those
taken
as
luxuries
it
should
also
be
varied
according
if
the
mass
is
intended
to
receive
vanilla
or
not
in
fine
to
make
good
chocolate
a
number
of
very
subtle
equations
must
be
resolved
and
which
we
take
advantage
of
without
suspecting
that
they
ever
took
place
for
a
long
time
machines
have
been
employed
for
the
manufacture
of
chocolate
we
think
this
does
not
add
at
all
to
its
perfection
but
it
diminishes
manipulation
very
materially
so
that
those
who
have
adopted
it
should
be
able
to
sell
chocolate
at
a
very
low
rate
footnote
one
of
those
machines
is
now
in
operation
in
a
window
in
broadway
new
york
it
is
a
model
of
mechanical
appropriateness
they
however
usually
sell
it
more
dearly
and
this
fact
demonstrates
that
the
true
spirit
of
commerce
has
not
yet
entered
france
the
use
of
machines
should
be
as
advantageous
to
the

transcendental
chemistry
has
taught
us
that
it
should
neither
be
rasped
with
the
knife
nor
bruised
with
a
pestle
because
thus
a
portion
of
the
sugar
is
converted
into
starch

the

made

thus
to

chocolate

is
to
say
to
make
it
fit

use
about
an
ounce

half

meditation
viii
on
thirst
thirst
is
the
internal
feeling
of
a
wish
to
drink
a
heat
of
about
degrees
reaumur
constantly
vaporizing
the
different
fluids
the
circulation
of
which
sustains
life
the
diminution
they
undergo
would
unfit
them
for
their
purposes
if
they
were
not
renewed
and
refreshed
the
necessity
of
this
renewal
is
what
we
call
thirst
we
think
the
seat
of
thirst
is
in
the
digestive
system
when
athirst
we
have
often
felt
the
sensation
when
hunting
we
feel
distinctly
that
all
the
inhaling
portions
of
the
nostrils
mouth
and
throat
are
benumbed
and
hardened
and
that
if
thirst
be
sometimes
appeased
by
the
application
of
fluids
to
other
parts
of
the
body
as
in
the
bath
the
reason
is
that
as
soon
as
they
are
absorbed
they
hurry
rapidly
to
the
seat
of
the
evil
and
become
remedies
varieties
of
thirst
looking
at
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
we
may
count
three
varieties
of
thirst
latent
factitious
and
permanent
latent
or
habitual
thirst
is
the
insensible
equilibrium
established
between
transpiratory
vaporization
and
the
necessity
of
supplying
what
is
lost
thus
though
we
experience
no
pain
we
are
invited
to
drink
while
we
eat
and
are
able
to
drink
at
almost
every
moment
of
the
day
this
thirst
accompanies
us
every
where
and
is
almost
a
portion
of
our
existence
factitious
thirst
is
peculiar
to
man
and
results
from
the
instinct
which
impels
him
to
seek
in
drink
the
strength
he
needs
it
is
an
artificial
enjoyment
rather
than
a
natural
want
this
thirst
is
really
governless
because
the
fluids
we
take
have
the
faculty
of
reviving
it
and
this
thirst
becomes
habitual
makes
drunkards
in
every
country
the
consequence
is
that
they
drink
as
long
as
liquor
lasts
or
until
they
are
utterly
overcome
when
on
the
other
hand
thirst
is
appeased
by
pure
water
which
seems
the
most
natural
remedy
we
never
drink
more
than
we
actually
need
hardening
thirst
is
the
result
of
the
increase
of
the
want
and
of
the
impossibility
to
satisfy
latent
thirst
it
is
so
called
because
it
is
accompanied
by
hardness
of
the
tongue
dryness
of
the
palate
and
a
devouring
heat
in
all
the
body
the
sensation
of
thirst
is
so
intense
that
in
all
tongues
it
is
synonymous
with
excessive
desire
and
irrepressible
longing
thus
we
thirst
for
gold
wealth
power
science
expressions
which
never
would
have
become
common
had
men
not
have
been
athirst
and
aware
of
their
vengeance
appetite
is
pleasant
when
it
does
not
reach
the
point
of
hunger
thirst
is
not
so
and
as
soon
as
we
feel
it
we
are
uncomfortable
and
anxious
when
there
is
no
possibility
of
appeasing
it
the
state
of
mind
is
terrible
to
compensate
us
for
this
the
sense
of
thirst
procures
us
great
pleasure
and
when
great
thirst
is
appeased
or
a
delicious
drink
is
offered
to
one
moderately
athirst
the
whole
papillary
system
is
aroused
from
the
tip
of
the
tongue
to
the
extremity
of
the
stomach
we
die
of
thirst
more
rapidly
than
of
hunger
men
with
an
abundance
of
water
have
lived
for
eight
days
without
bread
without
water
the
system
succumbs
on
the
fifth
the
reason
is
that
in
starving
man
dies
more
of
weakness
in
thirst
of
a
burning
fever
people
are
not
always
able
to
resist
thirst
so
long
in
one
of
the
hundred
swiss
of
louis
died
from
having
been
four
hours
without
drink
he
was
at
a
cabaret
with
some
of
his
comrades
and
as
he
was
about
to
carry
his
glass
to
his
lips
he
was
reproached
with
drinking
oftener
than
the
rest
and
with
not
being
able
to
do
a
moment
without
it
he
then
made
a
bet
of
ten
bottles
of
wine
that
he
would
not
drink
for
hours
he
ceased
at
once
and
sat
by
for
two
hours
seeing
the
others
drink
the
night
passed
well
enough
but
at
dawn
he
found
it
difficult
to
do
without
his
habitual
glass
of
brandy
all
the
morning
he
was
uneasy
and
troubled
he
went
hither
and
thither
without
reason
and
seemed
not
to
know
what
he
was
about
at
one
he
laid
down
fancying
he
would
be
calmer
he
was
really
sick
but
those
about
him
could
not
induce
him
to
drink
he
said
he
could
get
on
till
evening
he
wished
to
gain
his
bet
and
it
is
probable
also
that
some
military
pride
was
mingled
in
the
matter
which
prevented
him
from
yielding
to
pain
he
kept
up
until
seven
but
at
seven
was
very
sick
and
soon
died
without
being
able
to
swallow
a
glass
of
wine
which
was
presented
to
him
i
was
informed
of
all
these
details
that
very
night

causes
of
thirst
many
circumstances
either
united
or
separate
contribute
to
thirst
we
shall
mention
some
which
are
not
without
influence
on
our
habits
heat
augments
thirst
whence
comes
the
disposition
men
have
always
had
to
build
their
habitations
near
the
sea
corporeal
labor
augments
thirst
persons
who
employ
labourers
always
gratify
them
by
drink
hence
the
proverb
that
wine
given
them
is
always
well
sold
dancing
increases
thirst
and
for
this
reason
the
is
always
supplied
with
invigorating
drinks
declamation
also
increases
thirst
which
accounts
for
the
glass
of
water
readers
always
seek
to
drink
with
grace
and
which
is
always
beside
the
white
handkerchief
on
the
desk
genesiac
pleasure
excites
thirst
and
accounts
for
the
poetical
descriptions
of
cyprus
amathonte
gnidus
and
other
homes
of
venus
in
which
there
are
always
shady
groves
and
murmuring
streamlets
song
augments
thirst
and
therefore
all
vocalists
are
said
to
be
such
huge
drinkers
a
musician
myself
i
protest
against
this
assertion
which
has
neither
rhyme
nor
reason
the
artists
in
our
saloons
drink
with
as
much
prudence
as
sagacity
what
they
lose
in
this
however
they
atone
for
on
the
other
side
if
not
given
to
drink
they
are
untiring
gourmands
so
much
so
that
i
am
told
at
the
circle
of
transcendental
harmony
footnote

well
known
musical
society

festivals

cecile
lasted
hours
example
exposure
to
a
rapid
current
of
air
causes
a
rapid
augmentation
of
thirst
and
i
think
the
following
observations
will
be
read
with
pleasure
by
all
the
lovers
of
the
chase
it
is
well
known
that
quail
are
fond
of
huge
mountains
where
their
broods
are
in
more
safety
from
the
fact
that
the
harvests
are
later
when
the
rye
is
cut
they
go
into
the
barley
and
oats
and
when
the
latter
is
being
harvested
they
go
into
that
portion
which
is
less
matured
this
is
the
time
to
shoot
them
because
in
a
small
number
of
acres
are
found
all
the
birds
which
a
few
months
before
were
strewn
through
a
whole
commune
and
are
at
that
time
fat
as
possible
i
went
with
some
friends
for
the
purpose
of
shooting
to
a
mountain
in
the
arrondissiment
of
nantua
in
the
canton
known
as
plan
where
we
were
about
to
commence
the
day
work
under
a
brighter
sun
than
any
parisian
badaud
ever
saw
while
we
were
at
breakfast
a
violent
north
wind
arose
which
was
much
in
the
way
of
our
sport
we
however
continued
we
had
scarcely
been
out
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
most
effeminate
of
the
party
said
he
was
thirsty
we
now
doubtless
would
have
laughed
at
him
had
we
not
all
experienced
the
same
sensation
we
all
drank
for
an
ass
loaded
with
refreshments
followed
us
but
the
relief
afforded
was
of
brief
duration
the
thirst
soon
appeared
with
increased
intensity
so
that
some
fancied
themselves
sick
and
others
were
becoming
so
and
all
talked
of
returning
to
do
so
was
to
have
travelled
ten
leagues
for
no
purpose
i
had
time
to
collect
my
ideas
and
saw
the
reason
of
this
strange
thirst
and
told
them
we
suffered
from
the
effects
of
three
causes
the
dimunition
of
atmospheric
pressure
made
our
circulation
more
rapid
the
sun
heated
us
and
walking
had
increased
transpiration
more
than
all
these
the
wind
dried
up
this
transpiration
and
prevented
all
moistness
of
the
skin
i
told
them
that
there
was
no
danger
that
the
enemy
was
known
and
that
we
must
oppose
it
precaution
however
was
ineffectual
for
their
thirst
was
quenchless
water
wine
and
water
and
brandy
all
were
powerless
we
suffered
from
thirst
even
while
we
drank
and
were
uncomfortable
all

we
got

the
day
however
the
owner
of
the
domain

us
joining
the
provisions
we
had
to
his
own
stores
we
dined
very
well
and
got
into
the
where
we
slept
soundly
the
next
day
experience
showed
my
theory
to
be
true
the
wind
lulled
the
sun
was
not
so
warm
and
we
experienced
no
inconvenience
from
thirst
but
a
great
misfortune
had
befallen
us
we

very
prudently
filled
our
canteens
but
they
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
many
assaults
made
on
them
they
were
bodies
without
souls
and
we
all
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
we
had
to
come
to
that
point
not
however
without
murmuring
i
addressed
an
allocution
full

i
can
establish
this
theory
by
a
very
remarkable
circumstance
i
received
from
my
nephew
colonel
guigard
a
man
not
disposed
to
tell
long
stories
all
may
rely
upon
the
accuracy
of
what
he
has
said
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
detachment
returning
from
the
siege
of
jaffa
and
was
but
a
few
hundred
paces
from
the
place
where
he
expected
to
find
water
and
where
he
met
many
of
the
advanced
guard
already
dead
with
heat
among
the
victims
of
this
burning
climate
was
a
carabinier
who
was
known
to
many
persons
of
the
detachment
many
of
his
comrades
who
approached
him
for
the
last
time
either
to
inherit
what
he
had
left
or
to
bid
him
adieu
were
amazed
to
find
his
limbs
flexible
and
something
flexible
around
his
heart

him
a
drop
of
sacre

the
lustig
of
the
troupe
if
he
is
not
too
far
gone
into
the
other
world
he
will
come
back
to
taste
it
at
the
reception
of
the
first
spoonful
of
spirits
he
opened
his
eyes
they
then
rubbed
his
temples
and
gave
him
a
drop
or
two
after
about
an
hour
he
was
able
to
sit
up
in
the

was
taken
to

during
the
night

carefully
attended

is
one
thing
very
worthy
of
attention
the
instinct
which
leads
us
to
look

dates
to
an
age
far
beyond

all
men
even
those
we
call
savages
have
been
so
tormented
by
the
passion
for
strong
drinks
that
limited
as
their
capacities
were
they
were
yet
able
to
manufacture
them
they
made
the
milk
of
their
domestic
animals
sour
they
extracted
the
juice
of
many
animals
and
many
fruits
in
which
they
suspected
the
idea
of
fermentation
to
exist
wherever
men
are
found
strong
liquors
are
met
with
and
are
used
in
festivities
sacrifices
marriages
funeral
rites
and
on
all
solemn
occasions
for
many
centuries
wine
was
drank
and
sung
before
any
persons
had
an
idea
that
it
was
possible
to
extract
the
spirituous
portion
which
is
the
essence
of
its
power
the
arabs
however
taught
us
the
art
of
distillation
invented
by
them
to
extract
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
especially
of
the
rose
so
celebrated
in
their
poems
then
persons
began
to
fancy
that
in
wine
a
source
of
excitement
might
be
found
to
give
taste
a
peculiar
exaltation
by
gradual
experiments
alcohol
spirits
of
wine
and
brandy
were
discovered
alcohol
is
the
monarch
of
liquids
and
takes
possession
of
the
extreme
tastes
of
the
palate
its
various
preparations
offer
us
countless
new
flavors
and
to
certain
medicinal
remedies
it
gives
an
energy
they
could
not
well
do
without
it
has
even
become
a
formidable
weapon

been
more
utterly
destroyed
by
brandy
than
by
gunpowder
the
method
by
which
alcohol
was
discovered
has
led
to
yet
more
important
results
as
it
consisted
in
the
separation
and
exhibition
of
the
constituent
parts
of
a
body
it
became
a
guide
to
those
engaged
in
analogous
pursuits
and
made
us
acquainted
with
new
substances
such
as
quinine
morphine
strychnine
and
other
similar
ones
be
this
as
it
may
the
thirst
for
a
liquid
which
nature
has
shrouded
in
veils
the
extraordinary
appetite
acting
on
all
races
of
men
under
all
climates
and
temperatures
is
well
calculated
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
observer
i
have
often
been
inclined
to
place
the
passion
for
spirituous
liquors
utterly
unknown
to
animals
side
by
side
with
anxiety
for
the
future
equally
strange
to
them
and
to
look
on
the
one
and
the
other
as
distinctive
attributes
of
the
last
sublunary
revolution
meditation
x
an
episode
on
the
end
of
the
world
i
said
last
sublunary
revolution
and
this
idea
awakened
many
strange
ideas
many
things
demonstrate
to
us
that
our
globe
has
undergone
many
changes
each
of
which
was
so
to
say
an
end
of
the
world
some
instinct
tells
us
many
other
changes
are
to
follow
more
than
once
we
have
thought
these
revolutions
likely
to
come
and
the
comet
of
jerome
lalande
has
sent
many
persons
to
the
confessional
the
effect
of
all
this
has
been
that
every
one
is
disposed
to
surround
this
catastrophe
with
vengeance
exterminating
angels
trumps
and
other
accessories
alas
there
is
no
use
to
take
so
much
trouble
to
ruin
us
we
are
not
worth
so
much
display
and
if
god
please
he
can
change
the
surface
of
the
globe
without
any
trouble
let
us
for
a
moment
suppose
that
one
of
those
wandering
stars
the
route
and
mission
of
which
none
know
and
the
appearance
of
which
is
always
accompanied
by
some
traditional
terror
let
us
suppose
that
it
passes
near
enough
to
the
sun
to
be
charged
with
a
superabundance
of
caloric
and
approach
near
enough
to
us
to
create
a
heat
of
sixty
degrees
reaumur
over
the
whole
earth
as
hot
again
as
the
temperature
caused
by
the
comet
of
all
vegetation
would
die
all
sounds
would
cease
the
earth
would
revolve
in
silence
until
other
circumstances
had
evolved
other
germs
yet
the
cause
of
this
disaster
would
have
remained
lost
in
the
vast
fields
of
air
and
would
never
have
approached
us
nearer
than
some
millions
of
leagues
this
event
which
in
the
main
has
ever
seemed
to
me
a
fit
subject
for
reverie
and
i
never
ceased
for
a
moment
to
dwell
on
it
this
ascending
heat
is
curious
to
be
looked
after
and
it
is
not
uninteresting
to
follow
its
effects
expansion
action
and
to
ask
how
great
it
was
during
the
first
second
and
subsequent
days
what
effect
it
had
on
the
earth
and
water
and
on
the
formation
and
mingling
and
detonation
of
gasses
what
influence
it
had
on
men
as
far
as
age
sex
strength
and
weakness
are
concerned
what
influence
it
has
on
obedience
to
the
laws
submission
to
authority
and
respect
to
persons
and
property
what
one
should
do
to
escape
from
danger
what
influence
it
has
on
love
friendship
parental
affection
and
devotion
what
is
its
influence
on
the
religious
sentiments
faith
resignation
and
hope
history
can
furnish
us
a
few
facts
on
its
moral
influence
for
the
end
of
the
world
has
more
than
once
been
predicted
and
determined
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
can
not
tell
my
readers
how
i
settled
all
this
but
i
will
not
rob
them
of
the
pleasure
of
thinking
of
the
matter
themselves
this
may
somewhat
shorten
some
of
their
sleepless
hours
and
ensure
them
a
few
siestas
during
the
day
great
danger
dissolves
all
bonds
when
the
yellow
fever
was
in
philadelphia
in
husbands
closed
the
doors
on
their

children
deserted
their

and

similar

meditation
xi
on
gourmandise
i
have
looked
through
various
dictionaries
for
the
word
gourmandise
and
have
found
no
translation
that
suited
me
it
is
described
as
a
sort
of
confusion
of
gluttony
and
voracity
whence
i
have
concluded
that
lexicographers
though
very
pleasant
people
in
other
respects
are
not
the
sort
of
men
to
swallow
a
partridge
wing
gracefully
with
one
hand
with
a
glass
of
laffitte
or
clos
de
vougeot
in
the
other
they
were
completely
oblivious
of
social
gourmandise
which
unites
athenian
elegance
roman
luxury
and
french
delicacy
which
arranges
wisely
flavors
energetically
and
judges
profoundly
this
is
a
precious
quality
which
might
be
a
virtue
and
which
is
certainly
the
source
of
many
pure
enjoyments
definitions
let
us
understand
each
other
gourmandise
is
a
passionate
preference
well
determined
and
satisfied
for
objects
which
flatter
our
taste
gourmandise
is
hostile
to
all
excesses
any
man
who
becomes
drunk
or
suffers
from
indigestion
is
likely
to
be
expunged
from
the
lists
gourmandise
also
comprehends
friandise
passion
for
light
delicacies
for
pastry
comfitures
etc
this
is
a
modification
introduced
for
the
special
benefit
of
women
and
men
like
the
other
sex
look
at
gourmandise
under
any
aspect
you
please
and
it
deserves
praise
physically
it
is
a
demonstration
of
the
healthy
state
of
the
organs
of
nutrition
morally
it
is
implicit
resignation
to
the
orders
of
god
who
made
us
eat
to
live
invites
us
to
do
so
by
appetite
sustains
us
by
flavor
and
rewards
us
by
pleasure
advantages
of
gourmandise
considered
from
the
points
of
view
of
political
economy
gourmandise
is
the
common
bond
which
unites
the
people
in
reciprocal
exchanges
of
the
articles
needed
for
daily
consumption
this
is
the
cause
of
voyages
from
one
pole
to
the
other
for
brandy
spices
sugars
seasonings
and
provisions
of
every
kind
even
eggs
and
melons
this
it
is
which
gives
a
proportional
price
to
things
either
mediocres
good
or
excellent
whether
the
articles
derive
them
out
of
or
from
nature
this
it
is
that
sustains
the
emulation
of
the
crowd
of
fishermen
huntsmen
gardeners
and
others
who
every
day
fill
the
wealthiest
kitchens
with
the
result
of
their
labours
this
it
is
which
supports
the
multitude
of
cooks
confectioners
who
employ
workmen
of
every
kind
and
who
perpetually
put
in
circulation
an
amount
of
money
which
the
shrewdest
calculator
can
not
imagine
let
us
observe
that
the
trades
and
occupations
dependent
on
gourmandise
have
this
great
advantage
that
on
one
hand
it
is
sustained
by
great
misfortunes
and
on
the
other
by
accidents
which
happen
from
day
to
day
in
the
state
of
society
we
now
have
reached
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
people
subsisting
merely
on
bread
and
vegetables
such
a
nation
if
it
existed
would
certainly
be
subjected
by
carnivorous
enemies
as
the
hindoos
were
to
all
who
ever
chose
to
attack
them
if
not
it
would
be
converted
by
the
cooks
of
its
neighbors
as
the
beotiens
were
after
the
battle
of
leuctres
sequel
gourmandise
offers
great
resources
to
fiscality
for
it
increases
customs
imports
etc
all
we
consume
pays
tribute
in
one
degree
or
another
and
there
is
no
source
of
public
revenue
to
which
gourmands
do
not
contribute
let
us
speak
for
a
moment
of
that
crowd
of
preparers
who
every
year
leave
france
to
instruct
foreign
nations
in
gourmandise
the
majority
succeed
and
obedient
to
the
unfasting
instinct
of
a
frenchman
fever
return
to
their
country
with
the
fruits
of
their
economy
this
return
is
greater
than
one
would
think
were
nations
grateful
to
what
rather
than
to
gourmandise
should
france
erect
a
monument
power
of
gourmandise
in
the
treaty
of
the
month
of
november
imposed
on
france
the
necessity
of
paying
the
allies
in
three
years
francs
added
to
this
was
the
necessity
of
meeting
the
demands
of
individuals
of
various
nations
for
whom
the
allied
sovereigns
had
stipulated
to
the
amount
of
more
than
to
this
must
be
added
requisitions
of
all
kinds
by
the
generals
of
the
enemies
who
loaded
whole
wagons
which
they
sent
towards
the
frontier
and
which
the
treasury
ultimately
had
to
pay
for
the
total
was
more
than
francs
one
might
one
almost
should
have
feared
that
such
large
payments
collected
from
day
to
day
would
have
produced
want
in
the
treasury
a
deprecation
of
all
fictitious
values
and
consequently
all
the
evils
which
befall
a
country
that
has
no
money
while
it
owes
much
alas
said
the
rich
as
they
saw
the
wagon
going
to
the
rue
vivienne
for
its
load
all
our
money
is
emigrating
next
year
we
will
bow
down
to
a
crown
we
are
utterly
ruined
all
our
undertakings
will
fail
and
we
will
not
be
able
to
borrow
there
will
be
nothing
but
ruin
and
civil
death
the
result
contradicted
all
these
fears
the
payments
to
the
amazement
of
financiers
were
made
without
trouble
public
credit
increased
and
all
hurried
after
loans
during
the
period
of
this
superpurgation
the
course
of
exchange
an
infallible
measure
of
the
circulating
of
money
was
in
our
favor
this
was
an
arithmetical
proof
that
more
money
came
into
france
than
left
it
what
power
came
to
our
aid
what
divinity
operated
this
miracle
gourmandise
when
the
britons
germans
teutons
cimmerians
and
scythes
made
an
irruption
into
france
they
came
with
extreme
voracity
and
with
stomachs
of
uncommon
capacity
they
were
not
long
contented
with
the
cheer
furnished
them
by
a
forced
hospitality
but
aspired
to
more
delicate
enjoyments
the
queen
city
ere
long
became
one
immense
refectory
the
new
comers
ate
in
shops
cafes
restaurants
and
even
in
the
streets
they
gorged
themselves
with
meat
fish
game
truffles
pastry
and
fruit
they
drank
with
an
avidity
quite
equal
to
their
appetite
and
always
called
for
the
most
costly
wine
expecting
in
those
unknown
enjoyments
pleasures
they
did
not
meet
with
superficial
observers
could
not
account
for
this
eating
without
hunger
which
seemed
limitless
all
true
frenchmen
however
rubbed
their
hands
and
said
they
are
under
the
charm
they
have
spent
this
evening
more
money
than
they
took
from
the
treasury
in
the
morning
this
epoch
was
favorable
to
all
those
who
contributed
to
the
gratification
of
the
taste
very

his

achard

the

in

effect
yet
lasts
for

crowd
to
paris
from
all
parts
of
europe
to
rest
from
the
fatigues
of
war
our
public
monuments
it
may
be
are
not
so
attractive
as
the
pleasures
of
gourmandise
everywhere
elaborated
in
paris
a
city
essentially
gourmand
a
lady
gourmand
gourmandise
is
not
unbecoming
to
women
it
suits
the
delicacy
of
their
organs
and
recompenses
them
for
some
pleasures
they
can
not
enjoy
and
for
some
evils
to
which
they
are
doomed
nothing
is
more
pleasant
than
to
see
a
pretty
woman
her
napkin
well
placed
under
her
arms
one
of
her
hands
on
the
table
while
the
other
carries
to
her
mouth
the
choice
piece
so
elegantly
carved
her
eyes
become
brilliant
her
lips
glow
her
conversation
is
agreeable
and
all
her
motions
become
graceful
with
so
many
advantages
she
is
irresistible
and
even
cato
the
censor
would
feel
himself
moved
anecdote
i
will
here
record
what
to
me
is
a
bitter
reflection
i
was
one
day
most
commodiously
fixed
at
table
by
the
side
of
the
pretty
madame
m
d
and
was
inwardly
rejoicing
at
having
obtained
such
an
advantageous
position
when
she
said
your
health
i
immediately
began
a
complimentary
phrase
which
however
i
did
not
finish
for
turning
to
her
neighbor
on
the
right
she
said
trinquons
they
touched
each
others
glasses
this
quick
transition
seemed
a
perfidy
and
the
passage
of
many
years
have
not
made
me
forget
it
are
women
gourmands
the
penchant
of
the
fair
sex
for
gourmandise
is
not
unlike
instinct
for
gourmandise
is
favorable
to
beauty
a
series
of
exact
and
rigorous
examinations
has
shown
that
a
succulent
and
delicate
person
on
careful
diet
keeps
the
appearance
of
old
age
long
absent
it
makes
the
eyes
more
brilliant
and
the
color
more
fresh
it
makes
the
muscles
stronger
and
as
the
depression
of
the
muscles
causes
wrinkles
those
terrible
enemies
of
beauty
it
is
true
that
other
things
being
equal
those
who
know
how
to
eat
are
ten
years
younger
than
those
ignorant
of
that
science
painters
and
sculptors
are
well
aware
of
this
for
they
never
represent
those
to
whom
abstinence
is
a
matter
of
duty
such
as
anchorites
and
misers
except
as
pale
thin
and
wrinkled
the
effects
of
gourmandise
on
sociability
gourmandise
is
one
of
the
principle
bonds
of
society
it
gradually
extends
that
spirit
of
conviviality
which
every
day
unites
different
professions
mingles
them
together
and
diminishes
the
angles
of
conviviality
this
it
is
which
induces
every
amphitryon
to
receive
his
guests
well
and
also
excites
the
gratitude
of
the
latter
when
they
see
themselves
well
taken
care
of
here
is
the
place
to
reprobate
those
stupid
masticators
who
with
the
most
guilty
indifference
to
the
greatest
luxuries
and
who
with
sacrilegious
indifference
inhale
the
odorous
perfume
of
nectar
general
every
display
of
high
intelligence
makes
explicit
praise
necessary
delicate
praise
is
necessary
wherever
a
wish
to
please
is
evident
influence
of
gourmandise
on
conjugal
happiness
when
gourmandise
is
shared
with
another
it
has
the
greatest
influence
on
conjugal
happiness
a
gourmand
couple
have
at
least
once
a
day
a
pleasant
occasion
to
meet
for
even
those
who
sleep
apart
and
there
are
many
dine
together
they
talk
of
what
they
have
eaten
of
what
they
have
seen
elsewhere
of
fashionable
dishes
and
of
new
inventions
etc
we
all
know
how
full
of
charms
this
chit
chat
is
music
doubtless
has
many
charms
for
those
who
love
it
but
to
succeed
one
must
make
a
business
of
it
besides
sometimes
one
has
a
cold
misplaces
the
score
has
the
sick
headache
or
feels
inert
one
necessity
calls
each
of
the
couple
to
the
table
where
the
same
feeling
retains
them
they
exhibit
naturally
slight
attentions
to
each
other
which
evinces
a
desire
to
please
and
the
manner
in
which
they
act
to
each
other
speaks
loudly
of
the
manner
of
their
lives
this
observation
though
new
in
france
has
not
escaped
the
attention
of
the
english
novelist
fielding
who
in
pamela
gives
the
instance
of
the
manner
in
which
the
heroine
and
her
husband
lived
on
the
one
hand
and
the
more
magnificent
but
unhappy
life
of
the
elder
brother
and
his
wife
honour
then
to
gourmandise
as
we
present
it
to
our
readers
inasmuch
as
it
diverts
man
neither
from
occupation
nor
from
duty
for
as
the
dissoluteness
of
sardanapulus
did
not
cause
the
world
to
look
on
woman
with
horror
neither
did
vitellius
excesses
induce
the
world
to
turn
aside
from
a
entertainment
when
gourmandise
becomes
gluttony
voracity
or
debauchery
it
loses
its
name
and
attributes
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
moralist
who
will
treat
it
by
advice
or
the
medical
man
who
will
treat
it
by
remedy
gourmandise
as
the
professor
has
described
it
has
a
name
only
in
french
neither
the
latin
gula
english
gluttony
nor
german
lusternheit
expresses
it
and
we
recommend
all
who
attempt
a
translation
of
this
instructive
book
to
preserve
the
word
changing
the
article
which
produces
it
only
thus
they
did
with
coquetterie
note
of
a
patriot
gastronomer
i
observe
with
pride
that
gourmandise
and
coquettery
the
two
great
modifications
which
society
has
effected
in
our
imperious
wants
are
both
of

gourmands
all
who
wish
to
be

not
gourmands
there
are
individuals
to

nature
has

of
organs
and
a
degree
of
attention
without
which
the

unfortunate
men
who
are
badly
provided
with
the
means
of
appreciating
flavors
and
tastes
such
persons
have
but
an
obtuse
sensation
for
to
them
taste
is
what
light
is
to
the
blind
the
second
of
these
varieties
is
composed
of

minded
men
of
ambitious
persons
and
others
who
wish
to
attend
to
two
things
at
once
and
who
eat
only
to
eat
napoleon
such
was
napoleon
he
was
irregular
in
his
meals
and
ate
quickly
when
hungry
his
appetite
had
to
be
satisfied
at
once
and
he
was
so
completely
served
that
at
any
hour
he
could

gourmands
by
destiny
there
is
however
a
privileged
class
which
organic
and
material
organization
invites
to
the
enjoyments
of
the
taste
i
was
always
a
disciple
of
lavater
and
gall
and
believe
in
innate
ideas
as
persons
have
been
born
who
see
walk
and
hear
badly
because
they
are
lame
or
deaf
why
may
there
not
be
others
inclined
to
peculiar
sensations
to
the
most
careless
observer
there
will
ever
be
presented
faces
which
bear
the
undeniable
expression
of
some
dominant
sentiment
such
as
disdainful
impertinence
misanthropy
sensuality
a
very
meaningless
face
may
express
all
this
but
when
the
face
has
a
determined
expression
one
is
rarely
mistaken
passions
agitate
the
muscles
and
often
when
a
man
is
silent
the
various
feelings
which
agitate
him
may
be
read
on
his
face
this
tension
though
habitual
leave
sensible
traces
and
give
the
face
a
permanent
and
well
defined
character
sensual
predestination
the
persons
predestined
to
gourmandise
are
in
general
of
medium
stature
their
faces
are
either
round
or
square
and
small
their
noses
short
and
their
chins
rounded
the
women
are
rather
pretty
than
beautiful
and
they
have
a
slight
tendency
to
obesity
those
who
are
fondest
of
friandises
have
delicate
features
smaller
and
are
distinguished
by
a
peculiar
expression
of
the
mouth
agreeable
guests
should
be
sought
for
among
those
who
have
this
appearance
they
receive
all
that
is
offered
them
eat
slowly
and
taste
advisedly
they
do
not
seek
to
leave
places
too
quickly
where
they
have
been
kindly
received
they
are
always
in
for
all
the
evening
for
they
know
all
games
and
all
that
is
neccessary
for
a
gastronomical
soiree
those
on
the
contrary
to
whom
nature
has
refused
a
desire
for
the
gratifications
of
taste
have
a
long
nose
and
face
whatever
be
their
statures
the
face
seems
out
of
order
their
hair
is
dark
and
flat
and
they
have
no
embonpoint
they
invented
pantaloons
women
whom
nature
has
thus
afflicted
are
very
angulous
are
uncomfortable
at
the
table
and
live
on
lenten
fare
this
physiological
theory
will
i
trust
meet
with
not
many
contradictions
any
one
may
verify
the
matter
i
will
however
rely
on
facts
i
was
sitting
one
day
at
a
great
entertainment
and
saw
opposite
to
me
a
very
pretty
woman
with
a
very
sensual
face
i
leaned
towards
my
neighbor
and
said
that
the
lady
with
such
features
must
be
gourmande
bah
said
he
she
is
not
more
than
fifteen
she
is
not
old
enough
let
us
see
though
the
beginning
was
not
favorable
and
i
was
afraid
of
being
compromised
during
the
first
two
courses
the
young
woman
ate
with
a
discretion
which
really
amazed
me
the
dessert
came
it
was
brilliant
as
it
was
abundant
and
gave
me
some
hopes
i
was
not
deceived
for
she
not
only
ate
what
was
set
before
her
but
sent
for
dishes
which
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
she
tasted
every
thing
and
we
were
surprised
that
so
small
a
stomach
could
contain
so
much
my
diagnostics
succeeded
and
science
triumphed
two
years
after
i
met
this
same
lady
who
had
been
married
a
week
she
had
become
far
more
beautiful
was
something
of
a
coquette
for
fashion
permitted
her
to
exhibit
her
charms
her
husband
was
a
man
worth
looking
at
but
he
was
like
one
of
those
ventriloquists
who
laugh
on
one
side
of
the
face
and
weep
on
the
other
he
was
very
fond
of
his
wife
but
when
any
one
spoke
to
her
quivered
with
jealousy
the
latter
sentiment
prevailed
for
he
took
his
wife
to
one
of
the
most
remote
departments
of
france
and
i
at
least
can
write
no
more
of
her
biography
i
made
a
similar
observation
about
the
duke
of
decres
long
minister
of
marine
we
knew
that
he
was
large
short
dark
and
square
that
his
face
was
round
that
his
chin
protruded
that
his
lips
were
thick
and
that
he
had
a
giant
mouth
i
therefore
had
no
hesitation
in
proclaiming
him
fond
of
good
cheer
and
of
women
this
physiognomical
remark
i
whispered
to
a
woman
i
thought
very
pretty
and
very
discreet
i
was
mistaken
though
for
she
was
a
daughter
of
eve
and
my
secret
was
made
known
one
evening
his
excellency
was
informed
of
the
idea
i
had
deduced
from
his
face
i
ascertained
this
the
next
day
by
a
pleasant
letter
which
i
received
from
the
duke
in
which
he
insisted
that
he
had
not
the
two
qualities
i
had
attributed
to
him
i
confessed
myself
beaten
i
replied
that
nature
does
nothing
in
vain
that
she
had
evidently
formed
him
for
certain
duties
and
that
if
he
did
not
fulfil
them
he
contradicted
his
appearance
that
besides
i
had
no
right
to
expect
such
confidence
etc
there
the
correspondence
terminated
but
a
few
days
after
all
paris
was
amused
by
the
famous
encounter
between
the
minister
and
his
cook
in
which
his
excellency
did
not
get
the
best
of
the
matter
if
after
such
an
affair
the
cook
was
not
dismissed
and
he
was
not
i
may
conclude
that
the
duke
was
completely
overcome
by
the
artist
talents
and
that
he
could
not
find
another
one
to
suit
his
taste
so
exactly
otherwise
he
would
have
gotten
rid
of
so
warlike
a
servant
as
i
wrote
these
lines
during
a
fine
winter
evening
cartier
once
first
violinist
of
the
opera
entered
my
room
and
sat
by
the
fire
i
was
full
of
my
subject
and
looked
attentively
at
him
i
said
my
dear
professor
how
comes
it
that
you
who
have
every
feature
of
gourmandise
are
not
a
gourmand
i
am
said
he
but
i
make
abstinence
a
duty
is
that
an
act
of
prudence
he
did
not
reply
but
he
uttered
a
sigh
a
la
walter
scott
gourmands
by
profession
if
there
be
gourmands
by
predestination
there
are
also
gourmands
by
profession
there
are
four
classes
of
these
financiers
men
of
letters
doctors
and
devotees
financiers
financiers
are
the
heroes
of
gourmandise
hero
is
here
the
proper
name
for
there
was
some
contention
and
the
men
who
had
titles
crowd
all
others
beneath
their
titles
and
escutcheons
they
would
have
triumphed
but
for
the
wealth
of
those
they
opposed
cooks
contended
with
genealogists
and
though
dukes
did
not
fail
to
laugh
at
their
amphitryon
they
came
to
the
dinner
and
that
was
enough
those
persons
who
make
money
easily
must
be
gourmands
the
inequality
of
wealth
produces
inequality
of
wants
he
who
can
pay
every
day
for
a
dinner
fit
for
an
hundred
persons
is
often
satisfied
after
having
eaten
the
thigh
of
a
chicken
art
then
must
use
well
its
resources
to
revive
appetite
thus
mondar
became
a
gourmand
and
others
with
the
same
tastes
collects
around
him
physicians
causes
of
another
nature
though
far
less
baneful
act
on
physicians
who
from
the
nature
of
things
are
gourmands
to
resist
the
attractions
set
before
them
they
must
necessarily
be
made
of
bronze
one
day
i
ventured
to
say
doctor
corvisart
was
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
time
was
about
you
are
said
i
with
the
air
of
an
inspired
puritan
the
last
remnant
of
a
composition
which
once
covered
all
france
the
members
of
it
are
either
annihilated
or
dispersed
no
longer
do
we
see
farmers
general
abbes
chevaliers
bear
the
burden
they
have
bequeathed
to
you
even
if
you
take
the
three
hundred
spartans
who
died
at
thermopylae
such
a
fate
should
be
yours
nobody
contradicted
me
at
dinner
i
made
a
remark
which
was
worthy
of
notice
doctor
corvisart
was
a
very
pleasant
man
when
he
pleased
and
was
very
fond
of
iced
champagne
for
this
reason
while
all
the
rest
of
the
company
were
dull
and
idle
he
dealt
in
anecdotes
and
stories
on
the
contrary
when
the
dessert
was
put
on
and
conversation
became
animated
he
became
serious
and
almost
morose
from
this
and
other
observations
i
deduced
the
following
conclusion
champagne
the
first
effect
of
which
is
exhilarating
in
the
result
is
stupefying
on
account
of
the
excessant
carbonic
gases
it
contains
objugation
as
i
measure
doctors
by
their
diplomatu
i
will
not
reproach
them
for
the
severity
with
which
they
treat
their
invalids
as
soon
as
one
has
the
misfortune
to
fall
into
their
hands
one
has
to
give
up
all
we
have
previously
thought
agreeable
i
look
on
the
majority
of
these
prohibitions
as
useless
i
say
useless
because
patients
never
desire
what
is
injurious
to
them
a
reasonable
physician
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
natural
tendency
of
our
inclinations
nor
forget
to
ascertain
if
our
penchants
are
painful
in
themselves
or
improving
to
health
a
little
wine
or
a
few
drops
of
liquor
brings
the
smiles
to
the
most
hypochondriac
faces
besides
they
know
that
their
severe
prescriptions
are
almost
always
without
effect
and
the
patient
seeks
to
avoid
him
those
who
are
around
him
never
are
in
want
of
a
reason
to
gratify
him
people
however
will
die
the
ration
of
a
sick
russian
in
would
have
made
a
porter
drunk
there
was
no
retrenchment
to
be
made
for
military
inspectors
ran
from
day
to
day
through
the
hospitals
and
watched
over
the
furnishment
and
the
service
of
the
various
houses
i
express
my
opinions
with
the
more
confidence
because
it
is
sustained
by
much
experience
and
that
the
most
fortunate
practitioners
rely
on
my
system
the
canon
rollet
who
died
about
fifty
years
ago
was
a
great
drinker
and
the
first
physician
he
employed
forbid
him
to
use
wine
at
all
when
however
he
came
again
the
doctor
found
his
patient
in
bed
and
before
him
the
corpus
delicti
a
table
covered
with
a
white
cloth
a
chrystal
cup
a
handsome
bottle
and
a
napkin
to
wipe
his
lips
with
the
doctor
at
once
became
enraged
and
was
about
to
withdraw
when
the
canon
said
in
a
lamentable
voice
doctor
remember
if
you
forbade
my
drinking
you
did
not
prohibit
my
looking
at
the
bottle
the
physician
who
attended
montlusin
de
point
de
veyle
was
far
more
cruel
for
he
not
only
forbid
his
patient
to
touch
wine
but
made
him
drink
large
quantities
of
water
a
short
time
after
the
doctor
had
left
mme
de
montlusin
anxious
to
fulfil
the
requisition
of
the
prescription
and
contribute
to
her
husband
recovery
gave
him
a
great
glass
of
water
pure
and
limpid
as
possible
the
patient
received
it
kindly
and
sought
to
drink
it
with
resignation
at
the
first
swallow
however
he
stopped
and
giving
the
glass
back
to
his
wife
said
take
this
dear
and
keep
it
for
the
next
dose
i
have
always
heard
one
should
never
trifle
with
remedies
men
of
letters
in
the
world
of
gastronomy
have
a
place
nearly
equal
to
that
of
men
of
medical
faculty
under
the
reign
of
louis
men
of
letters
were
all
given
to
drink
they
conformed
to
fashion
and
the
memoirs
of
the
day
in
this
respect
are
very
defying
they
are
now
gourmands
a
great
amelioration
i
am
far
from
agreeing
with
the
cynic
geoffroy
who
used
to
say
that
modern
works
were
deficient
in
power
because
authors
now
drank
only
eau
sucree
i
think
he
made
two
mistakes
both
in
the
fact
and
the
consequences
the
age
we
live
in
is
rich
in
talents
they
injure
each
other
perhaps
by
their
multitude
but
posterity
judging
with
more
calmness
will
see
much
to
admire
thus
we
do
justice
to
the
great
productions
of
racine
and
moliere
which
when
written
were
coldly
received
the
social
position
of
men
of
letters
was
never
more
agreeable
they
no
longer
live
in
the
garrets
they
used
to
inhabit
for
the
field
of
literature
has
become
fertile
the
stream
of
hippocrene
rolls
down
golden
sands
equals
of
all
they
never
hear
the
language
of
protection
and
gourmandise
overwhelms
them
with
its
choicest
favours
men
of
letters
are
courted
on
account
of
their
talent
and
because
their
conversation
is
in
general
piquant
and
because
it
has
for
some
time
been
established
that
every
society
should
have
its
man
of
letters
these
gentlemen
always
come
a
little
too
late
they
are
not
however
received
the
most
on
that
account
for
they
have
been
anxiously
expected
they
are
petted
up
to
induce
them
to
come
again
are
flattered
to
make
them
brilliant
and
as
they
find
all
this
very
natural
they
grow
used
to
it
and
become
genuine
gourmands
devotees
among
the
friends
of
gourmandise
are
many
very
devout
persons
by
the
word
devotee
we
understand
what
louis
xiv
and
moliere
did
persons
the
piety
of
whom
consists
in
external
observances
pious
and
charitable
persons
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
class
let
us
see
how
they
effect
this
among
those
who
work
out
their
salvation
the
greatest
number
seek
the
mildest
method
those
who
avoid
society
sleep
on
the
ground
and
wear
hair
cloth
are
always
exceptions
now
there
are
to
them
certain
damnable
things
never
to
be
permitted
such
as
balls
plays
and
other
amusements
while
they
and
those
who
enjoy
them
are
abominated
gourmandise
assumes
an
altogether
different
aspect
and
becomes
almost
theological
jure
divino
man
is
the
king
of
nature
and
all
that
earth
creates
was
produced
for
him
for
him
the
quail
becomes
fat
the
mocha
has
its
perfume
and
sugar
becomes
beneficial
to
the
health
why
then
should
we
not
use
with
suitable
moderation
the
goods
which
providence
offers
us
especially
as
we
continue
to
look
on
them
as
perishable
things
and
as
they
exalt
our
appreciation
of
the
creator
other
not
less
weighty
reasons
strengthen
these
can
we
receive
too
kindly
those
persons
who
take
charge
of
our
souls
should
we
not
make
a
meeting
with
them
pleasant
and
agreeable
sometimes
the
gifts
of
comus
come
unexpectedly
an
old
college
companion
an
old
friend
a
penitent
who
humbles
himself
a
kinsman
who
makes
himself
known
or
a
protege
recalls
them
this
has
ever
been
the
case
convents
were
the
true
of
the
most
adorable
delacies
for
that
reason
they
have
been
so
much
regretted

was

the
table
with
more
care
and
reached
out
their
hands
as
the
cat
snatches
chestnuts
from
the
fire
their
faces
were
all
enjoyment
and
there
was
a
concentration
about
their
looks
more
easy
to
conceive
of
than
to
describe
as
of
the
present
generation
have
seen
nothing
like
either
the
abbes
or
chevaliers
and
as
it
is
necessary
to
understand
them
to
be
able
to
appreciate
many
books
written
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
will
borrow
from
the
author
of
the
historical
treatise
on
duels
a
few
pages
which
will
fully
satisfy
all
persons
about
this
subject
see
varieties
no
longevity
of
gourmands
i
am
happy
i
can
not
be
more
so
to
inform
my
readers
that
good
cheer
is
far
from
being
injurious
and
that
all
things
being
equal
gourmands
live
longer
than
other
people
this
was
proved
by
a
scientific
dissertation
recently
read
at
the
academy
by
doctor
villermet
he
compares
the
different
states
of
society
in
which
good
cheer
is
attended
to
with
those
where
no
attention
is
paid
to
it
and
has
passed
through
every
scale
of
the
ladder
he
has
compared
the
various
portions
of
paris
in
which
people
were
more
or
less
comfortable
all
know
that
in
this
respect
there
is
extreme
difference
as
for
instance
between
the
faubourg
antoine
and
the
chaussee
d
antin
the
doctor
extended
his
research
to
the
departments
of
france
and
compared
the
most
sterile
and
fertile
together
and
always
obtained
a
general
result
in
favor
of
the
diminution
of
mortality
in
proportion
universally
as
the
means
of
subsistence
improve
those
who
can
not
well
sustain
themselves
will
be
at
least
wise
to
know
that
death
will
deliver
them
soon
the
two
extremes
of
this
progression
are
that
in
the
most
highly
favored
ranks
of
life
but
one
individual
in
fifty
dies
while
of
those
who
are
poorer
four
do
those
who
indulge
in
good
cheer
are
rarely
or
never
sick
alas
they
often
fall
into
the
domain
of
the
faculty
who
call
them
good
patients
as
however
they
have
no
great
degree
of
vitality
and
all
portions
of
their
organization
are
better
sustained
nature
has
more
resources
and
the
body
incomparably
resists
destruction
this
physiological
truth
may
be
also
sustained
by
history
which
tells
us
that
as
often
as
impervious
circumstances
such
as
war
sieges
the
derangement
of
seasons
diminish
the
means
of
subsistence
such
times
have
ever
been
accompanied
by
contagious
disease
and
a
great
increase
of
mortality
the
idea
of
lafarge
would
beyond
a
doubt
have
succeeded
in
paris
if
those
who
had
advanced
it
had
introduced
into
their
calculations
the
truths
developed
by
doctor
villermet
they
calculated
mortality
according
to
buffoon
tables
and
those
of
parcieux
and
others
all
of
which
were
based
on
the
aggregate
of
all
classes
and
conditions
those
who
made
the
estimate
however
forgot
the
dangers
of
infancy
indulged
in
general
calculations
and
the
speculation
failed
this
may
not
have
been
the
only
hut
it
was
the
principal
cause
for
this
observation
we
are
indebted
to
the
professor
pardessus
de
belloy
archbishop
of
paris
had
a
slight
appetite
but
a
very
distinct
one
he
loved
good
cheer
and
i
have
often
seen
his
patriarchal
face
lighten
up
at
the
appearance
of
any
choice
dish
napoleon
always
on
such
occasions
paid
him
deference
and
respect

xiii
gastronomical
tests
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
seen
that
the
distinctive
characteristics
of
those
who
have
more
pretension
than
right
to
the
honors
of
gourmandise
consists
in
the
fact
that
at
the
best
spread
table
their
eyes
are
dull
and
their
face
inanimate
they
are
not
worthy
of
having
treasures
when
they
do
not
appreciate
what
is
exhibited
to
them
it
however
was
very
interesting
for
us
to
point
them
out
and
we
have
sought
every
where
for
information
on
so
important
a
matter
as
who
should
be
our
guests
and
our
hosts
we
set
about
this
with
an
anxiety
which
ensures
success
and
in
consequence
of
our
perseverance
we
are
able
to
present
to
the
corps
of
amphitryon
gastronomical
tests
a
discovery
which
will
do
honor
to
the
nineteenth
century
by
gastronomical
tests
we
mean
dishes
of
so
delicious
a
flavor
that
their
very
appearance
excites
the
gustatory
organs
of
every
healthy
man
the
consequence
is
that
all
those
who
do
not
evince
desire
and
the
radiancy
of
ecstasy
may
very
properly
be
set
down
as
unworthy
of
the
honours
of
the
society
and
the
pleasures
attached
to
them
the
method
of
tests
duly
deliberated
on
and
examined
in
the
great
council
has
been
described
in
the
golden
book
in
words
of
an
unchangeable
tongue
as
follows
utcumque
ferculum
eximii
et
bene
noti
saporis
appositum
fuerit
fiat
autopsia
convivoe
et
nisi
facies
ejus
ae
oculi
vertantur
ad
ecstasim
notetur
ut
indignus
this
was
rendered
into
the
vernacular
by
the
translator
of
the
grand
council
as
follows
whenever
a
dish
of
a
distinguished
and
good
flavor
is
served
the
guests
should
be
attentively
watched
and
those
the
faces
of
whom
do
not
express
pleasure
should
be
marked
as
unworthy
tests
are
relative
and
should
be
proportioned
to
the
various
classes
of
society
all
things
considered
it
should
be
arranged
so
as
to
create
admiration
and
surprise
it
is
a
dynameter
the
power
of
which
should
increase
as
we
ascend
in
society
the
test
for
a
householder
in
la
rue
coquenard
would
not
suit
a
second
clerk
and
would
be
unnoticed
at
the
table
of
a
financier
or
a
minister
in
the
enumeration
of
the
dishes
we
think
worthy
of
being
considered
as
tests
we
will
begin
at
the
lowest
grade
and
will
gradually
ascend
so
as
to
elucidate
the
theory
so
that
all
may
not
only
use
it
with
benefit
but
also
invent
a
new
series
calculated
for
the
sphere
in
which
they
chance
to
be
placed
we
will
now
give
a
list
of
the
dishes
we
think
fit
to
be
served
as
tests
we
have
divided
them
into
three
series
of
gradual
ascents
following
the
order
indicated
above

meditation
xiv
on
the
pleasures
of
the
table
man
of
all
the
animals
who
live
on
the
earth
is
beyond
doubt
the
one
who
experiences
most
suffering
nature
condemned
him
to
suffering
by
robbing
him
of
hair
by
giving
him
such
a
peculiar
formation
of
his
feet
also
by
the
instinct
of
destruction
and
of
war
which
has
followed
man
every
where
animals
have
never
been
stricken
with
this
curse
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
contests
caused
by
the
instinct
of
reproduction
harm
would
be
absolutely
unknown
to
the
lower
animals
of
creation
man
though
he
can
not
appreciate
pleasure
except
by
a
small
number
of
organs
may
yet
be
liable
to
intense
agony
this
decree
of
destiny
was
engraved
by
a
crowd
of
maladies
which
originated
in
the
social
system
the
result
is
that
the
most
intense
pleasure
one
can
imagine
can
not
atone
for
certain
pains
such
as
the
gout
the
acute
rheumatisms
strictures
and
many
other
diseases
we
might
mention
this
practical
fear
of
pain
has
had
the
effect
that
without
even
perceiving
it
man
has
rushed
into
an
opposite
direction
and
has
devoted
himself
to
the
small
number
of
pleasures
nature
has
placed
at
his
disposal
origin
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
meals
as
we
understand
the
word
began
at
the
second
stage
of
the
history
of
humanity
that
is
to
say
as
soon
as
we
ceased
to
live
on
fruits
alone
the
preparation
and
distribution
of
food
made
the
union
of
the
family
a
necessity
at
least
once
a
day
the
heads
of
families
then
distributed
the
produce
of
the
chase
and
grown
children
did
as
much
for
their
parents
these
collections
limited
at
first
to
near
relations
were
ultimately
extended
to
neighbors
and
friends
at
a
later
day
when
the
human
species
was
more
widely
extended
the
weary
traveler
used
to
sit
at
such
boards
and
tell
what
he
had
seen
in
foreign
lands
thus
hospitality
was
produced
and
its
rights
were
recognized
everywhere
there
was
never
any
one
so
ferocious
as
not
to
respect
him
who
had
partaken
of
his
bread
and
salt
difference
between
the
pleasure
of
eating
and
the
pleasures
of
the
table
such
from
the
nature
of
things
should
be
the
elements
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
which
where
eating
is
a
necessity
of
course
takes
the
precedence
the
pleasure
of
eating
is
a
peculiar
sensation
directed
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
necessity
the
pleasures
of
the
table
is
a
reflected
sensation
originating
in
various
facts
places
things
and
persons
we
share
with
animals
in
the
pleasure
of
eating
they
and
we
have
hunger
which
must
he
satisfied
it
is
peculiar
to
the
human
race
for
it
supposes
a
predisposition
for
food
for
the
place
of
meeting
and
for
guests
the
pleasures
of
the
table
exact
if
not
hunger
at
least
appetite
the
table
is
often
independent
of
hoth
the
one
and
the
other
this
we
may
see
at
every
entertainment
at
the
first
course
every
one
eats
and
pays
no
attention
to
conversation
all
ranks
and
grades
are
forgotten
together
in
the
great
manufacture
of
life
when
however
hunger
begins
to
be
satisfied
reflection
begins
and
conversation
commences
the
person
who
hitherto
had
been
a
mere
consumer
becomes
an
amiable
guest
in
proportion
as
the
master
of
all
things
provides
him
with
the
means
of
gratification
effects
the
pleasures
of
the
table
afford
neither
ravishing
pleasure
ecstasy
nor
transport
but
it
gains
in
intensity
what
it
loses
in
duration
it
is
the
more
valuable
because
it
exposes
us
to
all
other
gratifications
and
even
consoles
us
for
their
loss
after
a
good
dinner
body
and
soul
enjoy
a
peculiar
happiness
physically
as
the
brain
becomes
refreshed
the
face
lightens
up
the
colors
become
heightened
and
a
glow
spreads
over
the
whole
system
morally
the
mind
becomes
sharpened
witticisms
circulate
if
la
farre
and
saint
aulaire
descend
to
posterity
with
the
reputation
of
spiritual
authors
they
owe
it
especially
to
the
fact
that
they
were
pleasant
guests
besides
there
are
often
found
collected
around
the
same
table
all
the
modifications
of
society
which
extreme
sociability
has
introduced
among
us
love
friendship
business
speculation
power
ambition
and
intrigue
all
enhance
conviviality
thus
it
is
that
it
produces
fruits
of
all
imaginable
flavors
accessories
an
immediate
consequence
of
all
these
antecedents
is
that
human
industry
has
toiled
to
augment
the
duration
of
the
gratifications
of
the
table
poets
complain
that
the
throat
is
too
short
for
the
uses
of
degustation
and
others
lament
the
want
of
capacity
of
the
stomach
some
even
regret
that
digestion
is
accomplished
in
a
single
act
and
not
divided
into
two
this
was
but
an
extreme
effort
to
amplify
the
enjoyments
of
taste
in
this
respect
however
it
is
impossible
to
exceed
the
limits
imposed
by
nature
and
an
appeal
was
made
to
accessories
which
offered
more
latitude
vases
and
goblets
were
crowned
with
flowers
crowns
were
distributed
to
the
guests
and
dinners
served
beneath
the
vault
of
heaven
in
groves
and
amid
all
the
wonders
of
nature
music
and
song
were
made
to
increase
the
pleasures
of
the
table
thus
while
the
king
of
the
pheacians
ate
the
singer
phemius
sang
the
praises
of
the
wars
and
warriors
of
other
days
often
dancers
and
pantomimists
of
both
sexes
in
all
possible
costumes
occupied
the
attention
without
injuring
the
pleasure
of
the
meal
the
most
exquisite
perfumes
were
diffused
in
the
air
and
guests
were
often
waited
on
by
unveiled
beauty
so
that
every
sense
was
appealed
to
i
might
consume
many
pages
in
proving
what
i
advance
the
greek
authors
and
our
old
chroniclers
only
need
to
be
copied
these
researches
however
only
need
to
be
made
to
be
evident
and
my
erudition
would
be
of
little
value
the
and
century
we
have
adopted
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
various
methods
of
enjoyment
and
have
by
new
discoveries
somewhat
enhanced
the
number
the
delicacy
of
our
tastes
would
not
permit
the
vomitoria
of
the
romans
to
remain
we
did
better
however
and
accomplished
the
same
object
in
a
more
pleasant
manner
dishes
of
such
an
attractive
flavor
have
been
increased
that
they
perpetually
reproduce
the
appetite
they
are
so
light
that
they
flatter
the
appetite
without
loading
the
stomach
seneca
would
have
called
them
nubes
esculentas
we
have
advanced
so
far
in
alimentation
that
if
business
called
us
from
the
table
or
if
it
became
necessary
for
us
to
sleep
the
duration
of
the
meal
would
have
been
almost
indeterminable
one
must
not
however
believe
that
all
of
these
accessories
are
indispensable
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
pleasure
is
enjoyed
in
almost
all
its
extent
when
the
following
conditions
are
united
good
cheer
good
wine
a
pleasant
company
and
time
i
have
often
therefore
wished
to
have
been
present
at
one
of
those
pleasant
repasts
which
horace
invited
one
of
his
neighbors
to
share
viz
a
good
chicken
a
lamb
doubtless
fat
and
as
a
desert
grapes
figs
and
nuts
uniting
these
to
wine
made
when
manlius
was
consul
and
the
delicious
conversation
of
the

have

let
those
of
the
second
be
as
pleasant
and
as
highly
perfumed
as
possible
let
the
coffee
be
hot
and
let
the
master
select
his
own
wines
let
the
be
large
enough
to
permit
those
who
can
not
do
without
the
amusement
to
make
up
a
card
party
and
also
for
little
coteries
of
conversation
let
the
guests
be
retained
by
the
pleasures
of
society
and
by
the
hope
that
the
evening
will
not
pass
without
some
ulterior
enjoyment
the
tea
should
not
be
too
strong
the
roast
dishes
should
be
loaded
artistically
and
the
punch
made
carefully
none
should
begin
to
retire
before
eleven
and
at
midnight
all
should
have
gone
to
bed
if
any
one
has
been
present
at
an
entertainment
uniting
all
these
conditions
he
may
boast
of
having
witnessed
his
own
apotheosis
he
will
enjoy
it
the
more
because
many
other
apotheosis
have
been
forgotten
or
mistaken
i
have
said
that
the
pleasure
of
the
table
as
i
have
described
it
was
susceptible
of
long
duration
and
i
am
about
to
prove
it
by
the
history
of
the
longest
meal
i
ever
was
present
at
it
is
a
bonbon
i
give
the
reader
as
a
reward
for
patient
attention
to
me
here
it
is
i
had
a
family
of
kinsfolk
in
the
rue
de
bac
constituted
as
follows
a
doctor
who
was
a
captain
who
was
and
their
sister
jeannette
who
was
i
used
to
visit
them
sometimes
and
they
always
received
me
kindly
parbleu
said
doctor
dubois
rising
on
his
toes
one
day
to
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
you
have
a
long
time
been
bragging
about
your
fondues
eggs
and
cheese
and
you
always
make
our
mouths
water
the
captain
and
i
will
come
to
dine
with
you
and
we
will
see
what
your
famous
dish
is
this
took
place
about
willingly
said
i
and
to
enable
you
to
see
it
in
all
its
glory
i
will
cook
it
myself
i
am
delighted
with
your
proposition
and
wish
you
to
come
punctually
at
ten
at
the
appointed
time
my
guests
came
clean
shaved
and
with
their
heads
powdered
they
were
two
little
old
men
yet
fresh
however
and
well
they
smiled
with
pleasure
when
they
saw
the
table
ready
set
with
three
covers
and
with
two
dozen
oysters
by
each
plate
at
the
two
ends
of
the
table
were
bottles
of
sauterne
carefullly
wiped
except
the
cork
which
indicated
that
it
had
been
long
bottled
alas
i
have
gradually
seen
oysters
disappear
from
breakfast
though
they
were
once
so
common
they
disappeared
with
the
abbes
who
never
ate
less
than
a
gross
and
the
chevaliers
who
ate
quite
as
many
i
regret
them
but
as
a
philosopher
if
time
modifies
governments
how
great
must
be
its
influence
over
simple
usages
after
the
oysters
which
were
very
good
grilled
kidneys
a
pate
of
foie
gras
with
truffles
and
then
the
fondue
the
elements
had
been
put
in
a
and
brought
to
the
table
with
spirits
of
wine
i
set
at
once
to
work
and
my
two
cousins
watched
every
motion
i
made
they
were
delighted
and
asked
for
the
recipe
which
i
promised
telling
them
two
anecdotes
which
the
reader
will
perhaps
meet
with
elsewhere
after
the
fondue
we
had
the
various
fruits
which
were
in
season
and
a
cup
of
real
mocha
made
a
la
du
belloy
which
was
then
becoming
fashionable
we
ended
with
two
kinds
of
liqueurs
breakfast
being
over
i
invited
my
two
kinsmen
to
take
a
little
exercise
and
to
accompany
me
through
my
lodgings
which
are
far
from
being
elegant
and
which
my
friends
in
consequence
of
their
size
and
splendor
prefer
to
the
gilding
and
or
molu
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
i
showed
them
the
original
bust
of
my
pretty
cousin
mme
recamier
by
chinard
and
her
miniature
by
augustin
they
were
so
much
pleased
that
the
doctor
kissed
the
latter
with
his
thick
lips
and
the
captain
took
a
liberty
with
the
bust
of
the
first
for
which
i
reproved
him
were
all
the
admirers
of
the
original
to
do
as
he
did
the
bust
would
soon
be
in
the
condition
of
the
famous
statue
of
peter
at
borne
which
the
kisses
of
pilgrims
have
worn
away
i
showed
them
afterwards
casts
of
old
statuary
some
pictures
which
are
not
without
merit
my
guns
my
musical
instruments
and
several
fine
editions
of
the
french
and
foreign
classics
they
did
not
forget
the
kitchen
in
their
voyage
of
discovery
i
showed
them
my
economical
furnace
my
turnspit
by
my
roasting
apparatus
and
my
vaporiser
they
were
much
surprised
as
every
thing
in
their
house
was
done
in
the
style
of
the
regency
just
as
we
were
about
to
enter
the
room
the
clock
struck
two
peste
said
the
doctor
the
dinner
time
and
jeannette
awaits
us
we
must
go
not
because
i
wish
to
eat
but
i
must
have
my
bowl
of
soup
like
titus
diem
perdidi
my
dear
doctor
said
i
why
go
so
far
what
is
here
send
some
to
my
cousin
and
remain
here
if
you
will
and
accept
my
apology
for
a
somewhat
hasty
dinner
and
you
will
delight
me
there
was
an
ocular
consultation
on
the
matter
between
the
two
brothers
and
i
at
once
sent
a
messenger
to
the
faubourg
germain
i
also
told
my
cook
what
i
wished
after
a
time
in
part
with
his
own
resources
and
from
the
neighboring
restaurants
he
served
us
up
a
very
comfortable
little
dinner
it
was
a
great
gratification
to
me
to
see
the
sang
froid
and
quiet
nerve
with
which
my
kinsmen
sat
down
unfolded
their
napkins
and
began
they
met
with
two
surprises
which
i
did
not
anticipate
i
gave
them
parmesan
with
soup
and
a
glass
of
dry
madeira
these
two
novelties
had
just
been
introduced
by
de
tallyrand
the
first
of
our
diplomatists
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
so
many
shrewd
expressive
words
and
whom
public
attention
has
always
followed
with
marked
interest
even
when
he
had
retired
dinner
passed
very
comfortably
and
as
far
as
the
substantiate
and
the
accessories
were
concerned
my
friends
were
as
agreeable
as
they
were
merry
after
dinner
i
proposed
a
game
of
piquet
which
they
refused
preferring
as
the
captain
said
il
far
niente
of
the
italians
and
we
sat
around
the
fireplace
in
spite
of
the
pleasures
of
the
far
niente
i
have
often
thought
that
nothing
enlivens
conversation
more
than
any
occupation
which
distracts
but
does
not
absorb
all
coversation
tea
was
a
novelty
to
the
french
at
that
time
they
however
took
it
i
made
it
in
their
presence
and
they
took
it
with
greater
pleasure
because
hitherto
they
had
only
looked
on
it
as
a
remedy
long
observation
had
informed
me
that
one
piece
of
complaisance
ever
brings
on
another
and
that
after
one
step
there
is
no
choice
but
to
continue
in
the
same
route
you
will
kill
me
said
the
doctor
you
will
make
me
drunk
said
the
captain
i
made
no
reply
but
rang
for
rum
sugar
and
lemons
i
made
some
punch
and
while
i
was
preparing
some
excellent
well
buttered
toast
was
also
prepared
my
cousins
protested
that
they
could
not
eat
a
morsel
more
but
as
i
was
familliar
with
the
attraction
of
this
simple
preparation
i
insisted
and
the
captain
having
taken
the
first
slice
i
had
no
hesitation
in
ordering
more
time
rolled
on
and
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
eight
let
us
go
said
the
worthies
for
we
must
eat
a
salad
with
our
sister
who
has
not
seen
us
to
day
i
did
not
object
and
accompanied
the
two
pleasant
old
men
to
their
carriage
and
saw
them
leave
perhaps
the
question
may
be
asked
if
their
long
visit
did
not
annoy
me
i
answer
no
the
attention
of
my
guests
was
sustained
by
the
preparation
of
the
fondue
by
their
examination
of
my
rooms
by
a
few
novelties
after
dinner
by
the
tea
and
especially
by
the
punch
which
was
the
best
they
had
ever
tasted
the
doctor
too
knew
all
the
genealogy
and
history
of
the
people
of
paris
the
captain
had
passed
a
portion
of
his
life
in
italy
either
as
a
soldier
or
as
envoy
to
the
court
of
parma
i
had
travelled
much
and
conversation
pursued
its
natural
bent
under
such
circumstances
time
could
not
but
fly
rapidly
on
the
next
day
a
letter
from
the
doctor
informed
me
that
their
little
debauch
had
done
them
no
harm
but
that
after
a
quiet
night
rest
they
awoke
convinced
that
they
could
go
over
the
whole
matter
again
meditation
xv
haltes
de
chasse
amid
all
the
circumstances
in
life
when
eating
is
considered
valuable
one
of
the
most
agreeable
is
doubtless
when
there
is
a
pause
in
the
chase
it
alone
may
be
prolonged
the
most
without
ennui
after
a
few
hours
exercise
the
most
eager
huntsman
feels
a
necessity
for
rest
his
face
needs
caressing
by
the
morning
breeze
he
halts
however
not
from
necessity
but
by
that
instinctive
impulse
which
tells
him
that
his
activity
is
not
indefinite
shade
attracts
him
the
turf
receives
him
the
murmur
of
the
rivulet
advises
him
to
open
the
flask
he
has
brought
to
revive
himself
i
with
footnote
for
such
purposes
i
prefer
white

it
resists

better
than
any
other

overcome

they
are
two
friends
and
the
servant
is
at
once
happy
and
proud
to
be
the
guest
of
his
master
it
is
an
appetite
equally
unknown
to
the
worldly

not

if

catch
a

the

then
spread

i
am
sure
so

so

les
haltes
de
la

are
a
yet
virgin

we
have
only
touched
we
leave
the
subject
to
any
one
who
pleases
to
take
a
fancy
to
it
meditation
xvi
on
digestion
we
never
see
what
we
eat
says
an
old
adage
except
what
we
digest
how
few
however
know
what
digestion
is
though
it
is
a
necessity
equalizing
rich
and
poor
the
shepherd
and
the
king
the
majority
of
persons
who
like
jourdan
talked
prose
without
knowing
it
digest
without
knowing
how
for
them
i
make
a
popular
history
of
digestion
being
satisfied
that
jourdan
was
much
better
satisfied
when
his
master
told
him
that
he
wrote
prose
to
he
fully
acquainted
with
digestion
one
must
know
hoth
its
antecedents
and
consequents
ingestion
appetite
hunger
and
thirst
warn
us
that
the
hody
needs
restoration
pain
that
universal
monitor
never
ceases
to
torment
us
if
we
do
not
obey
it
then
comes
eating
and
drinking
which
are
ingestion
an
operation
which
begins
as
soon
as
the
food
is
in
the
mouth
and
enters
the
oesophagus
during
its
passage
through
a
space
of
a
few
inches
much
takes
place
the
teeth
divide
solid
food
the
glands
which
line
the
inside
of
the
mouth
moisten
it
the
tongue
mingles
the
food
presses
it
against
the
palate
so
as
to
force
out
the
juice
and
then
collects
the
elements
in
the
centre
of
the
mouth
after
which
resting
on
the
lower
jaw
it
lifts
up
the
central
portion
forming
a
kind
of
inclined
plane
to
the
lower
portion
of
the
mouth
where
they
are
received
by
the
pharynx
which
itself
contracting
forces
them
into
the
oesophagus
one
mouthful
having
thus
been
treated
a
second
is
managed
in
the
same
way
and
deglutition
continues
until
appetite
informs
us
that
it
is
time
to
stop
it
is
rarely
though
that
it
stops
here
for
as
it
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
man
to
drink
without
thirst
cooks
have
taught
him
to
eat
without
hunger
to
ensure
every
particle
of
food
reaching
the
stomach
two
dangers
must
be
avoided
it
must
not
pass
into
the
passage
behind
the
nose
which
luckily
is
covered
by
a
veil
the
second
is
that
it
must
not
enter
the
trachea
this
is
a
serious
danger
for
any
particle
passing
into
the
trachea
would
cause
a
convulsive
cough
which
would
last
until
it
was
expelled
an
admirable
mechanism
however
closes
the
glottis
while
we
swallow
and
we
have
a
certain
instinct
which
teaches
us
not
to
breathe
during
deglutition
in
general
therefore
we
may
say
that
in
spite
of
this
strange
conformation
food
passes
easily
into
the
stomach
where
the
exercise
of
the
will
ceases
and
digestion
begins
duty
of
the
stomach
digestion
is
a
purely
mechanical
operation
and
the
digestive
apparatus
may
be
considered
as
a
winnowing
mill
the
effect
of
which
is
to
extract
all
that
is
nutritious
and
to
get
rid
of
the
chaff
the
manner
in
which
digestion
is
effcted
has
been
so
long
a
question
for
argument
and
persons
have
sought
to
ascertain
if
it
were
effected
by
coction
fermentation
solution
chemical
or
vital
action
all
of
these
modes
have
their
influence
and
the
only
error
was
that
many
causes
were
sought
to
be
attributed
to
one
in
fact
food
impregnated
by
all
fluids
which
fill
the
mouth
and
oesophagus
reaches
the
stomach
where
it
is
impregnated
by
the
gastric
juices
which
always
fill
it
it
is
then
subjected
for
several
hours
to
a
heat
of
degrees
reaumer
it
is
mingled
by
the
organic
motion
of
the
stomach
which
their
presence
excites
they
act
on
each
other
by
the
effect
of
this
juxtaposition
and
fermentation
must
take
place
all
that
is
nourishing
ferments
in
consequence
of
all
of
these
operations
chyle
is
elaborated
and
spread
over
the
food
which
then
passes
the
pylorus
and
enters
the
intestines
portion
after
portion
succeeds
until
the
stomach
is
empty
thus
evacuating
itself
as
it
was
filled
the
pylorus
is
a
kind
of
chamber
between
the
stomach
and
the
intestines
so
constructed
that
food
once
in
it
can
ascend
only
with
great
difficulty
this
viscera
is
sometimes
obstructed
when
the
sufferer
after
long
and
intense
agony
dies
of
hunger
the
next
intestine
beyond
the
pylorus
is
the
duodenum
it
is
so
called
because
it
is
twelve
fingers
long
when
chyle
reaches
the
duodenum
it
receives
a
new
elaboration
by
being
mingled
with
bile
and
the
panchreatic
juice
it
loses
the
grey
color
and
acidity
it
previously
possessed
becomes
yellow
and
commences
to
assume
a
stercoral
odor
which
increases
as
it
advances
to
the
rectum
the
various
substances
act
reciprocally
on
each
other
there
must
consequently
be
many
analagous
gasses
produced
the
impulse
which
ejected
chyle
from
the
stomach
continues
and
forces
the
food
towards
the
lower
intestines
there
the
chyle
separates
itself
and
is
absorbed
by
organs
intended
for
the
purpose
whence
it
proceeds
to
the
liver
to
mingle
with
the
blood
which
it
revives
and
thus
repairs
the
losses
of
the
vital
organs
and
of
transpiration
it
is
difficult
to
explain
how
chyle
which
is
a
light
and
almost
insipid
fluid
can
be
extracted
from
a
mass
the
color
of
which
and
the
taste
are
so
deeply
pronounced
be
that
as
it
may
the
preparation
of
chyle
appears
to
be
the
true
object
of
digestion
and
as
soon
as
it
mingles
with
the
circulation
the
individual
becomes
aware
of
a
great
increase
of
physical
power
the
digestion
of
fluids
is
less
complicated
than
that
of
solids
and
can
be
explained
in
a
few
words
the
purely
liquid
portion
is
absorbed
by
the
stomach
and
thrown
into
circulation
thence
it
is
taken
to
the
veins
by
the
arteries
and
filtered
by
urethras
footnote
these
urethras
are
conduits
of
the
size
of
a
pea
which
start
from
the
kidneys
and
end
at
the
upper
neck
of
the
bladder
which
pass
them
as
urine
to
the
bladder
when
in
this
last
receptacle
and
though
restrained
by
the
spinchter
muscle
the
urine
remains
there
but
a
brief
time
its
exciting
nature
causes
a
desire
to
avoid
it
and
soon
voluntary
constriction
emits
it
through
canals
which
common
consent
does
not
permit
us
to
name
digestion
varies
in
the
time
it
consumes
according
to
the
temperament
of
individuals
the
mean
time
however
is
seven
hours
three
hours
for
the
stomach
and
the
rest
of
the
time
for
the
lower
intestines
from
this
expose
which
i
have
selected
from
the
most
reliable
authors
i
have
separated
all
anatomical
rigidities
and
scientific
abstractions
my
readers
will
thence
be
able
to
judge
where
the
last
meal
they
ate
is
during
the
first
three
hours
in
the
stomach
later
in
the
intestinal
canal
and
after
seven
hours
awaiting
expulsion
influence
of
digestion
of
all
corporeal
operations
digestion
is
the
one
which
has
the
closest
connection
with
the
moral
condition
of
man
this
assertion
should
amaze
no
one
things
can
not
be
otherwise
the
principles
of
physiology
tells
us
that
the
soul
is
liable
to
impressions
only
in
proportion
as
the
organs
subjected
to
it
have
relation
to
external
objects
whence
it
follows
that
when
these
organs
are
badly
preserved
badly
restored
or
irritated
this
state
of
degradation
exerts
a
necessary
influence
on
sensations
which
are
the
intermediates
of
mental
operations
thus
the
habitual
manner
in
which
digestion
is
performed
or
affected
makes
us
either
sad
gay
taciturn
gossiping
morose
or
melancholy
without
our
being
able
to
doubt
the
fact
or
to
resist
it
for
a
moment
in
this
respect
humanity
may
be
arranged
under
three
categories
the
regular
the
reserved
and
the
uncertain
each
of
the
persons
who
belong
to
each
of
the
series
not
only
have
similar
dispositions
and
propensities
but
there
is
something
analagous
and
similar
in
the
manner
in
which
they
fulfill
the
mission
from
which
chance
during
their
lives
has
separated
them
to
exhibit
an
example
i
will
go
into
the
vast
field
of
literature
i
think
men
of
letters
frequently
owe
all
their
characteristics
to
their
peculiar
mode
of
life
comic
poets
must
be
of
one
kind
tragic
poets
of
another
and
elegiac
of
the
uncertain
class
the
most
elegiac
and
the
most
comic
are
only
separated
by
a
variety
of
digestive
functions
by
an
application
of
this
principle
to
courage
when
prince
eugene
of
savoy
was
doing
the
greatest
injury
to
france
some
one
said
ah
why
can
i
not
send
him
a
pate
de
foie
gras
three
times
a
week
i
would
make
him
the
greatest
sluggard
of
europe
let
us
hurry
our
men
into
action
while
a
little
beef
is
left
in
their
bowels
said
an
english
general
digestion
in
the
young
is
very
often
accompanied
by
a
slight
chill
and
in
the
old
by
a
great
wish
to
sleep
in
the
first
case
nature
extracts
the
coloric
from
the
surface
to
use
it
in
its
laboratory
in
the
second
the
same
power
debilitated
by
age
can
not
at
once
satisfy
both
digestion
and
the
excitement
of
the
senses
when
digestion
has
just
begun
it
is
dangerous
to
yield
to
a
disposition
for
mental
work
one
of
the
greatest
causes
of
mortality
is
that
some
men
after
having
dined
and
perhaps
too
well
dined
can
neither
close
their
eyes
nor
their
ears
this
observation
contains
a
piece
of
advice
which
should
even
attract
the
most
careless
youth
usually
attentive
to
nothing
it
should
also
arrest
the
attention
of
grown
men
who
forget
nothing
not
even
that
time
never
pauses
and
which
is
a
penal
law
to
those
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
some
persons
are
fretful
while
digestion
is
going
on
at
that
time
nothing
should
be
suggested
to
and
no
favors
asked
of
them
among
these
was
marshal
augereau
who
during
the
first
hour
after
dinner
slaughtered
friends
and
enemies
indiscriminately
i
have
heard
it
said
that
there
were
two
persons
in
the
army
whom
the
always
wished
to
have
shot
the
and
the
head
of
his
general
staff
they
were
both
present
cherin
the
chief
of
staff
talked
back
to
him
and
the
commissary
though
he
said
nothing
did
not
think
a
bit
the
less
at
that
time
i
was
attached
to
his
general
staff
and
always
had
a
plate
at
his
table
i
used
however
to
go
thither
rarely
being
always
afraid
of
his
periodical
outbreaks
and
that
he
would
send
me
to
dinner
to
finish
my
digestion
i
met
him
afterwards
at
paris
and
as
he
testified
his
regret
that
he
had
not
seen
me
oftener
i
did
not
conceal
the
reason
we
laughed
over
the
matter
and
he
confessed
that
i
was
not
wrong
we
were
then
at
offenbourg
and
a
complaint
was
made
by
the
staff
that
we
ate
no
game
nor
fish
this
complaint
was
well
founded
for
it
is
a
maxim
of
public
law
that
the
conquerors
should
always
live
at
the
expense
of
the
conquered
on
that
very
day
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
master
of
the
forests
to
point
out
a
remedy
this
official
was
an
old
trooper
who
doubtless
was
unwilling
to
treat
us
kindly
lest
we
should
take
root
in
this
territory
his
answer
was
negative
and
evasive
the
game
keepers
afraid
of
our
soldiers
had
gone
the
fishermen
were
insubordinate
the
water
muddy
etc
to
all
this
i
said
nothing
but
i
sent
him
ten
grenadiers
to
be
lodged
and
fed
until
further
orders
the
remedy
was
effective
for
early
on
the
next
day
after
i
saw
a
heavily
loaded
wagon
come
the
had
come
back
the
fishermen
were
submissive
we
had
game
and
fish
enough
to
last
for
a
week
we
had
kid
snipe
lark
pike
etc
when
i
received
the
offering
i
freed
the
superintendent
from
his
troublesome
guests
and
during
the
whole
time
we
remained
in
that
part
of
the
country
we
had
nothing
to
complain
of
meditation
xvii
repose
man
is
not
made
to
enjoy
an
indefinite
activity
nature
has
destined
him
to
a
variable
existence
and
his
perceptions
must
end
after
a
certain
time
this
time
of
activity
may
be
prolonged
by
varying
the
nature
of
the
perceptions
to
be
experienced
and
a
continuity
of
life
brings
about
a
desire
for
repose
repose
leads
to
sleep
and
sleep
produces
dreams
here
we
find
ourselves
on
the
very
verge
of
humanity
for
the
man
who
sleeps
is
something
more
than
a
mere
social
being
the
law
protects
but
does
not
command
him
here
a
very
singular
fact
told
me
by
dom
duhaget
once
prior
of
the
chartreuse
convent
of
pierre
chatel
presents
itself
dom
duhaget
was
a
member
of
a
very
good
family
in
gascogne
and
had
served
with
some
distinction
as
a
captain
of
infantry
he
was
a
knight
of
st
louis
i
never
knew
any
one
the
conversation
of
whom
was
more
pleasant
there
was
said
he
before
i
went
to
pierre
chatel
a
monk
of
a
very
melancholy
humor
whose
character
was
very
sombre
and
who
was
looked
upon
as
a
somnambulist
he
used
often
to
leave
his
cell
and
when
he
went
astray
people
were
forced
to
guide
him
back
again
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
cure
him
but
in
vain
one
evening
i
had
not
gone
to
bed
at
the
usual
hour
but
was
in
my
office
looking
over
several
papers
when
i
saw
this
monk
enter
in
a
perfect
state
of
somnambulism
his
eyes
were
open
but
fixed
and
he
was
clad
in
the
tunic
in
which
he
should
have
gone
to
bed
but
he
had
a
huge
knife
in
his
hand
he
came
at
once
to
my
bed
the
position
of
which
he
was
familiar
with
and
after
having
felt
my
hand
struck
three
blows
which
penetrated
the
mattrass
on
which
i
laid
as
he
passed
in
front
of
me
his
brows
were
knit
and
i
saw
an
expression
of
extreme
gratification
pervaded
his
face
the
light
of
two
lamps
on
my
desk
made
no
impression
and
he
returned
as
he
had
come
opening
the
doors
which
led
to
his
cell
and
i
soon
became
satisfied
that
he
had
quietly
gone
to
bed
you
may
said
the
prior
fancy
my
state
after
this
terrible
apparition
i
trembled
at
the
danger
i
had
escaped
and
gave
thanks
to
providence
my
emotion
however
was
so
great
that
during
the
balance
of
the
night
i
could
not
sleep
on
the
next
day
i
sent
for
the
somnambulist
and
asked
him
what
he
had
dreamed
of
during
the
preceding
night
when
i
asked
the
question
he
became
troubled
said
he
had
so
strange
a
dream
that
it
really
annoys
me
i
fear
almost
to
tell
you
for
i
am
sure
the
devil
has
had
his
hand
in
it
order
you
to
tell
me
said
i
are
involuntary
and
this
may
only
be
an
illusion
speak
sincerely
to
me
said
he
i
had
scarcely
gone
to
sleep
when
i
dreamed
that
you
had
killed
my
mother
and
when
her
bloody
shadow
appeared
to
demand
vengeance
i
hurried
into
your
cell
and
as
i
thought
stabbed
you
not
long
after
i
arose
covered
with
perspiration
and
thanked
god
that
i
had
not
committed
the
crime
i
had
meditated
has
been
more
nearly
committed
said
i
with
a
kind
voice
you
think
i
then
told
him
what
had
passed
and
pointed
out
to
him
the
blows
he
had
aimed
at
me
he
cast
himself
at
my
feet
and
all
in
tears
wept
over
the
involuntary
crime
he
had
thought
to
commit
and
besought
me
to
inflict
any
penance
i
might
think
fit
said
i
will
not
punish
you
for
an
involuntary
act
henceforth
though
i
excuse
you
from
the
service
of
the
night
i
inform
you
that
your
cell
will
be
locked
on
the
outside
and
never
be
opened
except
to
permit
you
to
attend
to
the
first
mass
if
in
this
instance
from
which
a
miracle
only
saved
him
the
prior
had
been
killed
the
monk
would
not
have
suffered
for
he
would
have
committed
a
homicide
not
a
murder
time
of
rest
the
general
laws
of
the
globe
we
inhabit
have
an
influence
on
the
human
race
the
alternatives
of
day
and
night
are
felt
with
certain
varieties
over
the
whole
globe
but
the
result
of
all
this
is
the
indication
of
a
season
of
quiet
and
repose
probably
we
would
not
have
been
the
same
persons
had
we
lived
all
our
lives
without
any
change
of
day
or
night
be
this
as
it
may
when
one
has
enjoyed
for
a
certain
length
of
time
a
plentitude
of
life
a
time
comes
when
he
can
enjoy
nothing
his
impressibility
gradually
decreases
and
the
effects
on
each
of
his
senses
are
badly
arranged
the
organs
are
dull
and
the
soul
becomes
obtuse
it
is
easy
to
see
that
we
have
had
social
man
under
consideration
surrounded
by
all
the
attractions
of
civilization
the
necessity
of
this
is
peculiarly
evident
to
all
who
are
buried
either
in
the
studio
travel
as
soldiers
or
in
any
other
manner
in
repose
our
mother
nature
especially
luxuriates
the
man
who
really
reposes
enjoys
a
happiness
which
is
as
general
as
it
is
indefinable
his
arms
sink
by
their
own
weight
his
fibres
distend
his
brain
becomes
refreshed
his
senses
become
calm
and
his
sensations
obtuse
he
wishes
for
nothing
he
does
not
reflect
a
veil
of
gauze
is
spread
before
his
eyes
and
in
a
few
moments
he
will
sink
to
sleep
meditation
xviii
sleep
though
some
men
be
organized
that
they
may
be
said
not
to
sleep
yet
the
great
necessity
of
the
want
of
sleep
is
well
defined
as
is
hunger
or
thirst
the
advanced
sentinels
of
the
army
used
often
to
sleep
though
they
filled
their
eyes
with
snuff
definition
sleep
is
a
physical
condition
during
which
man
separates
himself
from
external
objects
by
the
inactivity
of
his
senses
and
has
only
a
mechanical
life
sleep
like
night
is
preceded
and
followed
by
two
twilights
the
one
leads
to
inertion
the
other
to
activity
let
us
seek
to
elucidate
these
phenomena
when
sleep
begins
the
organs
of
the
senses
fall
almost
into
inactivity
taste
first
disappears
then
the
sight
and
smell
the
ear
still
is
on
the
alert
and
touch
never
slumbers
it
ever
warns
us
of
danger
to
which
the
body
is
liable
sleep
is
always
preceded
by
a
more
or
less
voluptuous
sensation
the
body
yields
to
it
with
pleasure
being
certain
of
a
prompt
restoration
the
soul
gives
up
to
it
with
confidence
hoping
that
its
means
of
fiction
will
he
retempered
from
the
fact
of
their
not
appreciating
this
sensation
savants
of
high
rank
have
compared
sleep
to
death
which
all
living
beings
resist
as
much
as
possible
and
which
even
animals
show
a
horror
of
like
all
pleasures
sleep
becomes
a
passion
persons
have
been
known
to
sleep
away
of
their
life
like
all
other
passions
it
then
exerts
the
worst
influences
producing
idleness
indolence
sloth
and
death
the
school
of
salernum
granted
only
seven
hours
to
sleep
without
distinction
to
sex
or
age
this
maxim
was
too
severe
for
more
time
is
needed
by
children
and
more
should
from
complaisance
be
granted
to
women
though
whenever
more
than
ten
hours
is
passed
in
bed
there
is
abuse
in
the
early
hours
of
crepuscular
sleep
will
yet
exists
we
can
rouse
ourselves
and
the
eye
has
not
yet
lost
all
its
power
non
omnibus
dormio
said
mecenes
and
in
this
state
more
than
one
husband
has
acquired
a
sad
certainty
some
ideas
yet
originate
but
are
incoherent
there
are
doubtful
lights
and
see
indistinct
forms
flit
around
this
condition
does
not
last
long
for
sleep
soon
becomes
absolute
what
does
the
soul
do
in
the
interim
it
lives
in
itself
and
like
a
pilot
in
a
calm
like
a
mirror
at
night
a
lute
that
no
one
touches
awakes
new
excitement
some
psycologists
among
others
the
count
of
redern
say
that
the
soul
always
acts
the
evidence
is
that
a
man
aroused
from
sleep
always
preserves
a
memory
of
his
dreams
there
is
something
in
this
observation
which
deserves
verification
this
state
of
annihilation
however
is
of
brief
duration
never
exceeding
more
than
five
or
six
hours
losses
are
gradually
repaired
an
obscure
sense
of
existence
manifests
itself
and
the
sleeper
passes
into
the
empire
of
dreams
meditation
xix
dreams
dreams
are
material
impressions
on
the
soul
without
the
intervention
of
external
objects
these
phenomena
so
common
in
ordinary
times
are
yet
little
known
the
fault
resides
with
the
savants
who
did
not
allow
us
a
sufficiently
great
number
of
instances
time
will
however
remedy
this
and
the
double
nature
of
man
will
be
better
known
in
the
present
state
of
science
it
must
be
taken
for
granted
that
there
exists
a
fluid
subtle
as
it
is
powerful
which
transmits
to
the
brain
the
impressions
received
by
the
senses
this
excitement
is
the
cause
of
ideas
absolute
sleep
is
the
deperdition
or
inertia
of
this
fluid
we
must
believe
that
the
labors
of
digestion
and
assimulation
do
not
cease
during
sleep
but
repair
losses
so
that
there
is
a
time
when
the
individual
having
already
all
the
necessities
of
action
is
not
excited
by
external
objects
thus
the
nervous
fluid
movable
from
its
nature
passes
to
the
brain
through
the
nervous
conduits
it
insinuates
itself
into
the
same
places
and
follows
the
old
road
it
produces
the
same
but
less
intense
effects
i
could
easily
ascertain
the
reason
of
this
when
man
is
impressed
by
an
external
object
sensation
is
sudden
precise
and
involuntary
the
whole
organ
is
in
motion
when
on
the
contrary
the
same
impression
is
received
in
sleep
the
posterior
portion
of
the
nerves
only
is
in
motion
and
the
sensation
is
in
consequence
less
distinct
and
positive
to
make
ourselves
more
easily
understood
we
will
say
that
when
the
man
is
awake
the
whole
system
is
impressed
while
in
sleep
only
that
portion
near
the
brain
is
affected
we
know
however
that
in
voluptuous
dreams
nature
is
almost
as
much
gratified
as
by
our
waking
sensations
there
is
however
this
difference
in
the
organs
for
each
sex
has
all
the
elements
of
gratification
when
the
nervous
fluid
is
taken
to
our
brain
it
is
always
collected
in
vats
so
to
say
intended
for
the
use
of
one
of
our
senses
and
for
that
reason
a
certain
series
of
ideas
preferable
to
others
are
aroused
thus
we
see
when
the
optic
nerve
is
excited
and
hear
when
those
of
the
ear
are
moved
let
us
here
remark
that
taste
and
smell
are
rarely
experienced
in
dreams
we
dream
of
flowers
but
not
of
their
perfume
we
see
a
magnificently
arranged
table
but
have
no
perception
of
the
flavor
of
the
dishes
this
is
a
subject
of
enquiry
worthy
of
the
most
distinguished
science
we
mean
to
ascertain
why
certain
senses
are
lost
in
sleep
while
others
preserve
almost
their
full
activity
no
physiologist
has
ever
taken
care
of
this
matter
let
us
remark
that
the
influences
we
are
subject
to
when
we
sleep
are
internal
thus
sensual
ideas
are
nothing
after
the
anguish
we
suffer
at
a
dream
of
the
death
of
a
loved
child
at
such
moments
we
awake
to
find
ourselves
weeping
bitterly
nature
of
dreams
whimsical
as
some
of
the
ideas
which
visit
us
in
dreams
may
be
we
will
on
examination
find
they
are
either
recollections
or
combinations
of
memory
i
am
inclined
to
say
that
dreams
are
the
memory
of
sensations
their
strangeness
exists
only
in
the
oddity
of
association
which
rejects
all
idea
of
law
and
of
chronology
of
propriety
and
time
no
one
however
ever
dreamed
of
any
thing
absolutely
unknown
to
him
no
one
will
be
amazed
at
the
strangeness
of
our
dreams
when
we
remember
that
when
awake
our
senses
are
on
the
alert
and
respectively
rectify
each
other
when
a
man
sleeps
however
every
sensation
is
left
to
his
own
resources
i
am
inclined
to
compare
these
two
conditions
of
the
brain
to
a
piano
at
which
some
great
musician
sits
and
who
as
he
throws
his
fingers
over
the
keys
recalls
some
melody
which
he
might
harmonize
if
he
use
all
his
power
this
comparison
may
be
extended
yet
further
when
we
remember
that
reflection
is
to
ideas
what
harmony
is
to
sounds
that
certain
ideas
contain
others
as
a
principle
sound
contains
the
others
which
follow
it
etc
etc
system
of
gall
having
followed
thus
far
a
subject
which
is
not
without
interest
i
have
come
to
the
confines
of
the
system
of
gall
who
sustains
the
multiformity
of
the
organs
of
the
brain
i
can
not
go
farther
nor
pass
the
limits
i
have
imposed
on
myself
yet
from
the
love
of
science
to
which
it
may
be
seen
i
am
no
stranger
i
can
not
refrain
from
making
known
two
observations
i
made
with
care
and
which
are
the
more
important
as
many
persons
will
be
able
to
verify
them
first
observation
about
there
was
in
a
little
village
called
gevrin
in
the
arrondissement
of
belley
a
very
shrewd
tradesman
named
landot
who
had
amassed
a
very
pretty
fortune
all
at
once
he
was
stricken
with
paralysis
the
doctors
came
to
his
assistance
and
preserved
his
life
not
however
without
loss
for
all
of
his
faculties
especially
memory
was
gone
he
however
got
on
well
enough
resumed
his
appetite
and
was
able
to
attend
to
his
business
when
seen
to
be
in
this
state
all
those
with
whom
he
ever
had
dealings
thought
the
time
for
his
revenge
was
come
and
under
the
pretext
of
amusing
him
offered
all
kinds
of
bargains
exchanges
etc
they
found
themselves
mistaken
and
had
to
relinquish
their
hopes
the
old
man
had
lost
none
of
his
commercial
faculties
though
he
forgot
his
own
name
and
those
of
his
servants
he
was
always
familiar
with
the
and
knew
the
exact
value
of
every
acre
and
vineyard
in
the
vicinity
in
this
respect
his
judgment
had
be
en
uninjured
and
the
consequence
was
that
many
of
the
assailants
were
taken
in
their
own
snares
second
observation
at
belley
there
was
a
chirol
who
had
served
for
a
long
time
in
the
gardes
du
corps
of
louis
xv
and
xvi
he
had
just
sense
enough
for
his
profession
but
he
was
passionately
fond
of
all
kinds
of
games
playing
piquet
whist
and
any
new
game
that
from
time
to
time
might
be
introduced
chirol
also
became
apoplectic
and
fell
into
a
state
of
almost
absolute
insensibility
two
things
however
were
spared
his
faculty
for
digestion
and
his
passion
for
play
he
used
to
go
every
day
to
a
house
he
had
been
used
to
frequent
sat
in
a
corner
and
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
any
thing
that
passed
around
him
when
the
time
came
to
arrange
the
card
parties
they
used
to
invite
him
to
take
a
hand
then
it
became
evident
that
the
malady
which
had
prostrated
the
majority
of
his
faculties
had
not
affected
his
play
not
long
before
he
died
chirol
gave
a
striking
proof
that
this
faculty
was
uninjured
there
came
to
belley
a
banker
from
paris
the
name
of
whom
i
think
was
delins
he
had
letters
of
introduction
he
was
a
parisian
and
that
was
enough
in
a
small
city
to
induce
all
to
seek
to
make
his
time
pass
agreeably
as
possible
delins
was
a
gourmand
and
was
fond
of
play
in
one
point
of
view
he
was
easily
satisfied
for
they
used
to
keep
him
every
day
five
or
six
hours
at
the
table
it
was
difficult
however
to
amuse
his
second
faculty
he
was
fond
of
piquet
and
used
to
talk
of
six
francs
a
fiche
far
heavier
play
than
we
indulged
in
to
overcome
this
obstacle
a
company
was
formed
in
which
each
one
risked
something
some
said
that
the
people
of
paris
knew
more
than
we
and
others
that
all
parisians
were
inclined
to
boasting
the
company
was
however
formed
and
the
game
was
assigned
to
chirol
when
the
parisian
banker
saw
the
long
pale
face
and
limping
form
opposed
to
him
he
fancied
at
first
that
he
was
the
butt
of
joke
when
however
he
saw
the
artistic
manner
with
which
the
spectre
handled
the
cards
he
began
to
think
he
had
an
adversary
worthy
of
him
for
once
he
was
not
slow
in
being
convinced
that
the
faculty
yet
existed
for
not
only
in
that
but
in
many
other
games
was
delins
so
beaten
that
he
had
to
pay
more
than
six
hundred
francs
to
the
company
which
was
carefully
divided
result
the
consequences
of
these
two
observations
are
easily
deduced
it
seems
clear
that
in
each
case
the
blow
which
deranged
the
brain
had
spared
for
a
long
time
that
portion
of
the
organ
employed
in
commerce
and
in
gaming
it
had
resisted
it
beyond
doubt
because
exercise
had
given
it
great
power
and
because
deeply
worked
impressions
hatf
exerted
great
influence
on
it
age
age
has
great
influence
on
the
nature
of
dreams
in
infancy
we
dream
of
games
gardens
flowers
and
other
smiling
objects
at
a
later
date
we
dream
of
pleasure
love
battles
and
marriages
later
still
we
dream
of
princely
favors
of
business
trouble
and
long
departed
pleasures
phenomena
of
dreams
certain
strange
phenomena
accompany
sleep
and
dreams
their
study
may
perhaps
account
for
anthropomania
and
for
this
reason
i
record
here
three
observations
selected
from
a
great
many
made
by
myself
during
the
silence
of
night
first
observation
i
dreamed
one
night
that
i
had
discovered
a
means
to
get
rid
of
the
laws
of
gravitation
so
that
it
became
as
easy
to
ascend
as
descend
and
that
i
could
do
either
as
i
pleased
this
estate
seemed
delicious
to
me
perhaps
many
persons
may
have
had
similar
dreams
one
curious
thing
however
occurs
to
me
which
i
remember
i
explained
very
distinctly
to
myself
the
means
which
led
me
to
such
a
result
and
they
seemed
so
simple
that
i
was
surprised
i
had
not
discovered
it
sooner
as
i
awoke
the
whole
explanation
escaped
my
mind
but
the
conclusion
remained
since
then
i
will
ever
be
persuaded
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
second
observation
a
few
months
ago
while
asleep
i
experienced
a
sensation
of
great
gratification
it
consisted
in
a
kind
of
delicious
tremor
of
all
the
organs
of
which
my
body
was
composed
a
violet
flame
played
over
my
brow
lambere
flamma
comas
et
circum
temporo
pasci
i
think
this
physical
state
did
not
last
more
than
twenty
seconds
and
i
awoke
with
a
sensation
of
something
of
terror
mingled
with
surprise
this
sensation
i
can
yet
remember
very
distinctly
and
from
various
observations
have
deduced
the
conclusion
that
the
limits
of
pleasure
are
not
as
yet
either
known
or
defined
and
that
we
do
not
know
how
far
the
body
may
be
beatified
i
trust
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
centuries
physiology
will
explain
these
sensations
and
recall
them
at
will
as
sleep
is
produced
by
opium
and
that
posterity
will
be
rewarded
by
them
for
the
atrocious
agony
they
often
suffer
from
when
sleeping
the
proposition
i
have
announced
to
a
degree
is
sustained
by
analogy
for
i
have
already
remarked
that
the
power
of
harmony
which
procures
us
such
acute
enjoyments
was
totally
unknown
to
the
romans
this
discovery
is
only
about
five
hundred
years
old
third
observation
in
the
year
viii
i
went
to
bed
as
usual
and
woke
up
about
one
as
i
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
i
found
myself
in
a
strange
state
of
cerebral
excitement
my
preception
was
keen
my
thoughts
profound
the
sphere
of
my
intelligence
seemed
increased
i
sat
up
and
my
eyes
were
affected
with
a
pale
vaporous
uncertain
light
which
however
did
not
enable
me
to
distinguish
objects
accurately
did
i
only
consult
the
crowd
of
ideas
which
succeeded
so
rapidly
i
might
have
fancied
that
this
state
lasted
many
hours
i
am
satisfied
however
that
it
did
not
last
more
than
half
an
hour
an
external
accident
unconnected
with
volition
however
aroused
me
from
it
and
i
was
recalled
to
the
things
of
earth
when
the
luminous
apparition
disappeared
i
became
aware
of
a
sense
of
dryness
and
in
fact
regained
my
waking
faculties
as
i
was
now
wide
awake
my
memory
retained
a
portion
of
the
ideas
indistinctly
which
crossed
my
mind
the
first
ideas
had
time
as
their
subject
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
past
present
and
future
became
identical
were
narrowed
down
to
a
point
so
that
it
was
as
easy
to
look
forward
into
the
future
as
back
into
the
past
this
is
all
i
remember
of
this
first
intuition
which
was
almost
effaced
by
subsequent
ones
attention
was
then
directed
to
the
senses
which
i
followed
in
the
order
of
their
perfection
and
fancying
that
those
should
be
examined
which
were
internal
as
well
as
external
i
began
to
follow
them
out
i
found
three
and
almost
four
when
i
fell
again
to
earth
compassion
is
a
sensation
we
feel
about
the
heart
when
we
see
another
suffer
predilection
is
a
feeling
which
attracts
us
not
only
to
an
object
but
to
all
connected
with
it
sympathy
is
the
feeling
which
attracts
two
beings
together
from
the
first
aspect
one
might
believe
that
these
two
sentiments
are
one
and
the
same
they
can
not
however
be
confounded
for
predilection
is
not
always
reciprocal
while
sympathy
must
be
while
thinking
of
compassion
i
was
led
to
a
deduction
i
think
very
just
and
which
at
another
time
i
would
have
overlooked
it
is
the
theory
on
which
all
legislation
is
founded
do
as
you
will
be
done
by
alteri
ne
facias
quod
tibi
fieri
non
vis
such
is
an
idea
of
the
state
in
which
i
was
and
to
enjoy
it
again
i
would
willingly
relinquish
a
month
of
my
life
in
bed
we
sleep
comfortably
in
a
horizontal
position
and
with
the
head
warm
thoughts
and
ideas
come
quickly
and
abundantly
expressions
follow
and
as
to
write
one
has
to
get
up
we
take
off
the
night
cap
and
go
to
the
desk
things
all
at
once
seem
to
change
the
examination
becomes
cold
the
thread
of
our
ideas
is
broken
we
are
forced
to
look
with
trouble
for
what
was
found
so
easily
and
we
are
often
forced
to
postpone
study
to
another
day
all
this
is
easily
explained
by
the
effect
produced
on
the
brain
by
a
change
of
position
the
influence
of
the
physic
and
moral
is
here
experienced
following
out
this
observation
i
have
perhaps
gone
rather
far
but
i
have
been
induced
to
think
that
the
excitability
of
oriental
nations
was
in
a
manner
due
to
the
fact
that
in
obedience
to
the
religion
of
mahomet
they
used
to
keep
the
head
warm
for
a
reason
exactly
contrary
to
that
which
induced
all
monastic
legislators
to
enjoin
shaven
crowns

whether

or

is
yet
subject
to
the
laws
of
nutrition
and
to
gastronomy
theory
and

and

of

have
a
great

effects
of

on

a
man
who
is
badly
fed
can
not
bear
for
a
long
time
the
fatigues
of
prolonged
labor
his
strength
even
abandons
him
and
to
him
rest
is
only
loss
of
power
if
his
labor
be
mental
his
ideas
are
crude
and
undecided
reflection
contributes
nothing
to
them
nor
does
judgment
analyze
them
the
brain
exhausts
itself
in
vain
efforts
and
the

i
always
thought
that
the
suppers
of
auteuil
and

of
the
hotels
of
rambouillet
and
soissons
formed
many
of
the
authors
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
geoffrey
was
not
far
wrong
when
he
characterised
the
authors
of
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
as
eau
sucree
that
was
their
habitual
beverage
according
to
these
principles
i
have
examined
the
works
of
certain
well
known
authors
said
to
have
been
poor
and
suffering
and
i
never
found
any
energy
in
them
except
when
they
were
stimulated
by
badly
conceived
envy
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
boulogne
the
emperor
napoleon
fasted
for
thirty
hours
both
with
his
council
and
with
the
various
depositories
of
his
power
without
any
refreshment
other
than
two
very
brief
meals
and
a
few
cups
of
coffee
brown
mentions
an
admiralty
clerk
who
having
lost
his
memorandum
without
which
he
could
not
carry
on
his
duty
passed
consecutive
hours
in
preparing
them
again
without
due
regimen
he
never
could
have
borne
the
fatigue
and
sustained
himself
as
follows
at
first
he
drank
water
then
wine
and
ultimately
took
opium
i
met
one
day
a
courier
whom
i
had
known
in
the
army
on
his
way
from
spain
whither
he
had
been
sent
with
a
government
dispatch
correo
ganando
horas
he
made
the
trip
in
twelve
days
having
halted
only
four
hours
in
madrid
to
drink
a
few
glasses
of
wine
and
to
take
some
soup
this
was
all
the
nourishment
he
took
during
this
long
series
of
sleepless
nights
and
fatigues
he
said
that
more
solid
sustenance
would
have
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
continue
his
journey
dreams
diet
has
no
trifling
influence
on
sleep
and
dreams
a
hungry
man
can
not
sleep
for
the
pain
he
suffers
keeps
him
awake
if
weakness
or
exhaustion
overcome
him
his
slumber
is
light
uneasy
and
broken
a
person
however
who
has
eaten
too
much
sinks
at
once
to
sleep
if
he
dreams
he
remembers
nothing
of
it
for
the
nervous
fluid
has
been
intercepted
in
the
passages
he
awakes
quickly
and
when
awake
is
very
sensible
of
the
pains
of
digestion
we
may
then
lay
down
as
a
general
rule
that
coffee
rejects
sleep
custom
weakens
and
even
causes
this
inconvenience
entirely
to
disappear
europeans
whenever
they
yield
to
it
always
feel
its
power
some
food
however
gently
invites
sleep
such
as
that
which
contains
milk
the
whole
family
of
letuces
etc
consequence
experience
relying
on
a
multitude
of
observations
has
informed
us
that
diet
has
an
influence
on
dreams
in
general
all
stimullkt
food
excites
dreams
such
as
flock
game
ducks
venison
and
hare
this
quality
is
recognised
in
asparagus
celery
truffles
perfume
confectioneries
and
vanilla
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
think
that
we
should
banish
from
our
tables
all
somniferous
articles
the
dreams
they
produce
are
in
general
agreeable
light
and
prolong
our
existence
even
when
it
is
suspended
there
are
persons
to
whom
sleep
is
a
life
apart
and
whose
dreams
are
serial
so
that
they
end
in
one
night
a
dream
begun
on
the
night
before
while
asleep
they
distinguish
faces
they
remember
to
have
seen
but
which
they
never
met
with
in
the
real
world
result
a
person
who
reflects
on
his
physical
life
and
who
does
so
according
to
the
principles
we
develop
is
the
one
who
prepares
sagaciously
for
rest
sleep
and
dreams
he
distributes
his
labor
so
that
he
never
himself
he
lightens
it
and
refreshes
himself
by
brief
intervals
of
rest
which
relieve
him
without
interrupting
its
continuity
sometimes
a
duty
if
longer
rest
is
required
during
the
day
he
indulges
in
it
only
in
a
sitting
attitude
he
refuses
sleep
unless
he
be
forced
irresistibly
to
use
it
and
is
careful
not
to
make
it
habitual
when
night
brings
about
the
hour
of
repose
he
retires
to
an
airy
room
does
not
wrap
himself
up
in
curtains
which
make
him
breathe
the
same
air
again
and
again
and
never
closes
the
blinds
so
that
when
he
wakes
he
will
meet
with
at
least
one
ray
of
light
he
rests
in
a
bed
with
the
head
slightly
higher
than
the
feet
his
pillow
is
of
hair
his
night
cap
of
cloth
and
his
breast
unincumbered
by
a
mass
of
coverings
he
is
careful
however
to
keep
his
feet
warm
he
eats
with
discretion
and
never
refuses
good
and
excellent
cheer
he
drinks
prudently
even
the
best
wine
at
dessert
he
talks
of
gallantry
more
than
of
politics
makes
more
madrigals
than
epigrams
he
takes
his
coffee
if
it
suits
his
constitution
and
afterwards
swallows
a
spoonful
of
liquor
though
it
he
only
to
perfume
his
breath
he
is
in
all
respects
a
good
guest
and
yet
never
exceeds
the
limits
of
discretion
in
this
state
satisfied
with
himself
and
others
he
lies
down
and
sinks
to
sleep
mysterious
dreams
then
give
an
agreeable
life
he
sees
those
he
loves
indulges
in
his
favorite
occupations
and
visits
places
which
please
him
then
he
feels
his
slumber
gradually
pass
away
and
does
not
regret
the
time
he
has
lost
because
even
in
his
sleep
he
has
enjoyed
unmixed
pleasure
and
an
activity
without
a
particle
of
fatigue
meditation

were
i
a
physician
with
a
diploma
i
would
have
written
a
whole
book
on
obesity
thus
i
would
have
acquired
a
domicil
in
the
domain
of
science
and
would
have
had
the
double
satisfaction
of
having
as
patients
persons
who
were
perfectly
well
and
of
being
besieged
by
the
fairer
portion
of
humanity
to
have
exactly
fat
enough
not
a
bit
too
much
or
too
little
is
the
great
study
of

of

rank

i

done
some
other

will
do

in
the

i
intend
to
prepare
the
way
for
him
a
chapter
on
obesity
is
a
necessary
concomitant
of
a
book
which
relates
so
exclusively
to
eating
obesity
is
that
state
of
greasy
congestion
in
which
without
the
sufferer
being
sick
the
limbs
gradually
increase
in
volume
and
lose
their
form
and
harmony
one
kind
of
obesity
is
restricted
to
the
stomach
and
i
have
never
observed
it
in
women
their
fibres
are
generally
softer
and
when
attacked
with
obesity
nothing
is
spared
i
call
this
variety
of
obesity
gastrophoria
those
attacked
by
it
i
call
gastrophorous
i
belong
to
this
category
yet
though
my
stomach
is
rather
prominent
i
have
a
round
and
well
turned
leg
my
sinews
are
like
those
of
an
arab
horse
i
always
however
looked
on
my
stomach
as
a
formidable
enemy
i
gradually
subdued
it
but
after
a
long
contest
i
am
indebted
for
all
this
to
a
strife
of
thirty
years
i
will
begin
my
treatise
by
an
extract
from
a
collection
of
more
than
five
hundred
dialogues
which
at
various
times
i
have
had
with
persons
menaced
with
obesity
an
what
delicious
bread
where
do
you
get
it
from
limet
in
the
rue
richelieu
baker
to
their
royal
highness
the
due
and
the
prince
de
conde
i
took
it
from
him
because
he
was
my
neighbour
and
have
kept
to
him
because
he
is
the
best
bread
maker
in
the
world
i
will
remember
the
address
i
eat
a
great
deal
of
bread
and
with
such
as
this
could
do
without
any
dinner
obese
no
what
are
you
about
you
are
eating
your
soup
but
set
aside
the
carolina
rice
it
contains
ah
that
it
is
a
regimen
i
subject
myself
to
it
is
a
bad
regimen
i
am
fond
of
rice
pates
and
all
such
things
nothing
is
more
nourishing
an
immense
do
me
the
favor
to
pass
me
the
potatoes
before
you
they
go
so
fast
that
i
fear
i
shall
not
be
in
time
there
they
are
sir
but
you
will
take
some
there
are
enough
for
two
and
after
us
the
deluge
not
i
look
on
the
potatoe
as
a
great
preservative
against
famine
nothing
however
seems
to
me
so
fade
that
is
a
gastronomical
heresy
nothing
is
better
than
the
potatoe
i
eat
them
in
every
way
an
obese
be
pleased
to
send
me
the
soissons
haricots
i
see
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
having
obeyed
the
order
hummed
in
a
low
tone
the
well
known
air
les

do
not
laugh
it
is
a
real
treasure
for
this
country
paris
gains
immensely
by
it
i
will
thank
you
to
pass
me
the
english
peas
when
young
they
are
food
fit
for
the
gods
i
anathema
on
beans
and
peas
bah
for
your
anathema
you
talk
as
if
you
were
a
whole
council
to
another
i
congratulate
you
on
your
good
health
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
fattened
somewhat
since
i
last
saw
you
i
probably
owe
it
to
a
change
of
diet
how
so
for
some
time
i
eat
a
rich
soup
for
breakfast
and
so
thick
that
the
spoon
would
stand
up
in
it
to
another
madame
if
i
do
not
mistake
you
will
accept
a
portion
of
this
charlotte
i
will
attack
it
no
sir
i
have
two
things
which
i
prefer
this
gateau
of
rice
and
that
savoy
biscuit
i
am
very
fond
of
sweet
things
while
they
talk
politics
madame
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
will
you
take
a
piece
of
this
tourte
a
la
frangipane
yes
i
like
nothing
better
than
pastry
we
have
a
cook
in
our
house
as
a
lodger
and
i
think
my
daughter
and
i
eat
up
all
his
rent
looking
at
the
daughter
you
both
are
benefitted
by
the
diet
your
daughter
is
a
fine
looking
young
woman
obese
yes
but
there
are
persons
who
say
she
is
too
fat
ah
those
who
do
so
are
envious
etc
by
this
and
similar
conversations
i
elucidate
a
theory
i
have
formed
about
the
human
race
viz
greasy
corpulence
always
has
as
its
first
cause
a
diet
with
too
much
farinacious
or
feculent
substance
i
am
sure
the
same
regime
will
always
have
the
same
effect
carniverous
animals
never
become
fat
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
wolf
jackal
lion
eagle
etc
herbiverous
animals
do
not
either
become
fat
until
age
has
made
repose
a
necessity
they
however
fatten
quickly
when
fed
on
potatoes
farinacious
grain
etc
obesity
is
rarely
met
with
among
savage
nations
or
in
that
class
of
persons
who
eat
to
live
instead
of
living
to
eat
causes
of
obesity
from
the
preceding
observation
the
causes
of
which
any
one
may
verify
it
is
easy
to
ascertain
the
principle
causes
of
obesity
the
first
is
the
nature
of
the
individual
almost
all
men
are
born
with
predispositions
the
impress
of
which
is
borne
by
their
faces
of
every
hundred
persons
who
die
of
diseases
of
the
chest
ninety
have
dark
hair
long
faces
and
sharp
noses
of
every
hundred
obese
persons
ninety
have
short
faces
blue
eyes
and
pug
noses
then
there
are
beyond
doubt
persons
predestined
to
obesity
the
digestive
powers
of
whom
elaborate
a
great
quantity
of
grease
this
physical
fact
of
the
truth
of
which
i
am
fully
satisfied
exerts
a
most
important
influence
on
our
manner
of
looking
at
things
when
we
meet
in
society
a
short
fat
rosy
individual
with
round
limbs
short
feet
all
pronounce
her
charming
better
informed
than
others
however
i
anticipate
the
ravages
which
ten
years
will
have
effected
on
her
and
sigh
over
evils
which
as
yet
do
not
exist
this
anticipated
compassion
is
a
painful
sentiment
and
proves
that
a
prescience
of
the
future
would
only
make
man
more
unhappy
the
second
of
the
causes
of
obesity
is
the
fact
that
farinacious
and
feculaferous
matter
is
the
basis
of
our
daily
food
we
have
already
said
that
all
animals
that
live
on
farinaceous
substances
become
fat
man
obeys
the
common
law
the
fecula
is
more
prompt
in
its
action
when
it
is
mingled
with
sugar
sugar
and
grease
are
alike
in
containing
large
quantities
of
hydrogen
and
are
both
inflammable
this
combination
is
the
more
powerful
from
the
fact
that
it
flatters
the
taste
and
that
we
never
eat
sweet
things
until
the
appetite
is
already
satisfied
so
that
we
are
forced
to
court
the
luxury
of
eating
by
every
refinement
of
temptation
the
fecula
is
not
less
fattening
when
in
solution
as
in
beer
and
other
drinks
of
the
same
kind
the
nations
who
indulge
the
most
in
them
are
those
who
have
the
most
huge
stomachs
some
parisian
families
who
in
drank
beer
habitually
because
of
the
dearness
of
wine
were
rewarded
by
a
degree
of
embonpoint
they
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
sequel
another
cause
of
obesity
is
found
in
the
prolongation
of
sleep
and
want
of
exercise
the
human
body
repairs
itself
much
during
sleep
and
at
the
same
time
loses
nothing
because
muscular
action
is
entirely
suspended
the
acquired
superfluity
must
then
be
evaporated
by
exercise
another
consequence
is
that
persons
who
sleep
soundly
always
refuse
every
thing
that
looks
the
least
like
fatigue
the
excess
of
assimilation
is
then
borne
away
by
the
torrent
of
circulation
it
takes
possession
by
a
process
the
secret
of
which
nature
has
reserved
to
herself
of
some
hundredths
of
hydrogen
and
fat
is
formed
to
be
deposited
in
the
tubes
of
the
cellular
tissue
sequel
the
last
cause
of
obesity
is
excess
of
eating
and
drinking
there
was
justice
in
the
assertion
that
one
of
the
privileges
of
the
human
race
is
to
eat
without
hunger
and
drink
without
thirst
animals
can
not
have
it
for
it
arises
from
reflection
on
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
a
desire
to
prolong
its
duration
this
double
passion
has
been
found
wherever
man
exists
we
know
savages
eat
to
the
very
acme
of
brutality
whenever
they
have
an
opportunity
cosmopolites
as
citizens
of
two
hemispheres
we
fancy
ourselves
at
the
very
apogee
of
civilization
yet
we
are
sure
we
eat
too
much
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
few
who
from
avarice
or
want
of
power
live
alone
the
first
are
delighted
at
the
idea
that
they
amass
money
and
others
distressed
that
they
do
not
it
is
the
case
however
with
those
around
us
for
all
whether
hosts
or
guests
offer
and
accept
with
complaisance
this
cause
almost
always
present
acts
differently
according
to
the
constitution
of
individuals
and
in
those
who
have
badly
organized
stomachs
produces
indigestion
but
not
obesity
anecdote
this
one
instance
which
all
paris
will
remember
lang
had
one
of
the
most
splendid
establishments
of
the
capital
his
table
especially
was
excellent
but
his
digestion
was
bad
as
his
gourmandise
was
great
he
did
the
honors
with
perfect
taste
and
ate
with
a
resolution
worthy
of
a
better
fate
all
used
to
go
on
very
well
till
coffee
was
introduced
but
the
stomach
soon
refused
the
labor
to
which
it
had
been
subjected
and
the
unfortunate
gastronomer
was
forced
to
throw
himself
on
the
sofa
and
remain
in
agony
until
the
next
day
in
expiation
of
the
brief
pleasure
he
had
enjoyed
it
is
very
strange
that
he
never
corrected
this
fault
as
long
as
he
lived
he
was
subjected
to
this
alternative
yet
the
sufferings
of
the
evening
never
had
any
influence
on
the
next
days
meal
persons
with
active
digestion
fare
as
was
described
in
the
preceding
article
all
is
digested
and
what
is
not
needed
for
nutrition
is
fixed
and
turned
into
fat
others
have
a
perpetual
indigestion
and
food
is
passed
without
having
left
any
nourishment
those
who
do
not
understand
the
matter
are
amazed
that
so
many
good
things
do
not
produce
a
better
effect
it
may
be
seen
that
i
do
not
go
very
minutely
into
the
matter
for
from
our
habits
many
secondary
causes
arise
due
to
our
habits
condition
inclinations
pleasures
etc
i
leave
all
this
to
the
successor
i
pointed
out
in
the
commencement
of
this
work
and
satisfy
myself
merely
with
the
prelibation
the
right
of
the
first
comer
to
every
sacrifice
intemperance
has
long
attracted
the
attention
of
observers
princes
have
made
sumptuary
laws
religion
has
moralized
for
gourmandise
but
alas
a
mouthfull
less
was
never
eaten
and
the
best
of
eating
every
day
becomes
more
flourishing
i
would
perhaps
be
fortunate
in
the
adoption
of
a
new
course
and
in
the
exposition
of
the
physical
causes
of
obesity
preservation
would
perhaps
be
more
powerful
than
morals
or
persuasive
than
reason
have
more
influence
than
laws
and
i
think
the
fair
sex
would
open
their
eyes
to
the
light
inconvenience
of
obesity
obesity
has
a
lamentable
influence
on
the
two
sexes
inasmuch
as
it
is
most
injurious
to
strength
and
beauty
it
lessens
strength
because
it
increases
the
weight
to
be
moved
while
the
motive
power
is
unchanged
it
injures
respiration
and
makes
all
labor
requiring
prolonged
muscular
power
impossible
obesity
destroys
beauty
by
annihilating
the
harmony
of
primitive
proportions
for
all
the
limbs
do
not
proportionately
fatten
it
destroys
beauty
by
filling
up
cavities
nature
hand
itself
designed
nothing
is
so
common
as
to
see
faces
once
very
interesting
made
by
obesity
the
head
of
the
last
government
did
not
escape
this
law
towards
the
latter
portion
of
his
life
he
napoleon
became
bloated
and
his
eyes
lost
a
great
portion
of
their
expression
obesity
produces
a
distaste
for
dancing
walking
riding
and
an
inaptitude
for
those
amusements
which
require
skill
or
agility
it
also
creates
a
disposition
to
certain
diseases
such
as
apoplexy
dropsy
ulcers
in
the
legs
and
makes
all
diseases
difficult
to
cure
examples
of
obesity
i
can
remember
no
corpulent
heroes
except
marius
and
john
sobieski
marius
was
short
and
was
about
as
broad
as
he
was
long
that
probably
frightened
the
cimber
who
was
about
to
kill
him
the
obesity
of
the
king
of
poland
had
nearly
been
fatal
to
him
for
having
stumbled
on
a
squadron
of
turkish
cavalry
from
which
he
had
to
fly
he
would
certainly
have
been
massacred
if
his
aids
had
not
sustained
him
almost
fainting
from
fatigue
on
his
horse
while
others
generously
sacrificed
themselves
to
protect
him
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
duc
de
vendome
a
worthy
son
of
henry
was
also
very
corpulent
he
died
at
an
inn
deserted
by
all
and
preserved
consciousness
just
long
enough
to
see
a
servant
snatch
away
a
pillow
on
which
his
head
was
resting
there
are
many
instances
of
remarkable
obesity
i
will
only
speak
however
of
my
own
observations
rameau
a
fellow
student
of
mine
and
maire
of
chaleur
was
about
five
feet
two
inches
high
but
weighed
five
hundred
pounds
the
duc
de
luynes
beside
whom
i
often
sat
became
enormous
fat
had
effaced
his
handsome
features
and
he
slept
away
the
best
portion
of
his
life
the
most
remarkable
case
though
i
saw
in
new
york
and
many
persons
now
in
paris
will
remember
to
have
seen
at
the
door
of
a
cafe
in
broadway
a
person
seated
in
an
immense
with
legs
stout
enough
to
have
sustained
a
church
footnote
many
persons
in
new
york
remember
the
person
referred
to
the
translator
has
heard
that
as
late
as
he
was
frequently
to
be
seen
at
the
door
of
a
house
near
where
the
atheneum
hotel
was
brillat
savarin
is
said
scarcely
to
exaggerate
edward
was
at
least
five
feet
ten
inches
and
was
about
eight
feet
french
in
circumference
his
fingers
were
like
those
of
the
roman
emperor
who
used
to
wear
his
wife
bracelets
as
rings
his
arms
and
legs
were
nearly
as
thick
as
the
waist
of
a
man
of
medium
size
and
his
feet
were
elephantine
covered
by
fat
pendant
from
his
legs
the
fat
on
his
cheek
had
weighed
down
his
lower
and
three
hanging
chins
made
his
face
horrible
to
behold
he
passed
his
life
near
a
window
which
looked
out
on
the
street
and
drank
from
time
to
time
a
glass
of
ale
from
a
huge
pitcher
he
kept
by
his
side
his
strange
appearance
used
to
attract
the
attention
of
passers
whom
he
used
always
to
put
to
flight
by
saying
in
a
sepulchral
tone
what
are
you
staring
at
like
wild
cats
go
about
your
business
you
blackguards
etc
having
spoken
to
him
one
day
he
told
me
that
he
was
not
at
all
annoyed
and
that
if
death
did
not
interrupt
him
he
would
be
glad
to
live
till
the
day
of
judgment
from
the
preceding
it
appears
that
if
obesity
be
not
a
disease
it
is
at
least
a
very
troublesome
predisposition
into
which
we
fall
from
our
own
fault
the
result
is
that
we
should
all
seek
to
preserve
ourselves
from
it
before
we
are
attacked
and
to
cure
ourselves
when
it
befalls
us
for
the
sake
of
the
unfortunate
we
will
examine
what
resources
science
presents
us
meditation
xxii
preservative
treatment
and
cure
of
obesity
footnote
about
twenty
years
ago
i
began
a
treatise
ex
professo
on
obesity
my
readers
must
especially
regret
the
preface
which
was
of
dramatic
form
i
averred
to
a
physician
that
a
fever
is
less
dangerous
than
a
law
suit
for
the
latter
after
having
made
a
man
run
fatigue
and
worry
himself
strips
him
of
pleasure
money
and
life
this
is
a
statement
which
might
be
propagated
as
well
as
any
other
i
will
begin
by
a
fact
which
proves
that
courage
is
needed
not
only
to
prevent
but
to
cure
obesity
louis
greffulhe
whom
his
majesty
afterwards
honored
with
the
title
of
count
came
one
morning
to
see
me
saying
that
he
had
understood
that
i
had
paid
great
attention
to
obesity
and
asked
me
for
advice
monsieur
said
i
not
being
a
doctor
with
a
diploma
i
might
refuse
you
but
i
will
not
provided
you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
for
one
month
you
will
rigorously
obey
my
directions
greffulhe
made
the
promise
i
required
and
gave
me
his
hand
on
the
next
day
i
gave
him
my
directions
the
first
article
of
which
demanded
that
he
should
at
once
get
himself
weighed
so
that
the
result
might
be
made
mathematically
after
a
month
he
came
to
see
me
again
and
spoke
to
me
nearly
thus
monsieur
said
he
i
followed
your
prescription
as
if
my
life
depended
on
it
and
during
the
month
i
am
satisfied
that
i
have
lost
three
pounds
and
more
but
have
for
that
purpose
to
violate
all
my
tastes
and
habits
so
completely
that
while
i
thank
you
for
your
advice
i
must
decline
to
follow
it
and
await
quietly
the
fate
god
ordains
for
me
i
heard
this
resolution
with
pain
greffulhe
became
every
day
fatter
and
subject
to
all
the
inconveniences
of
extreme
obesity
and
died
of
suffocation
when
he
was
about
forty
generalities
the
cure
of
obesity
should
begin
with
three
precepts
of
absolute
theory
discretion
in
eating
moderation
in
sleep
and
exercise
on
foot
or
horseback
these
are
the
first
resources
presented
to
us
by
science
i
however
have
little
faith
in
them
for
i
know
men
and
things
enough
to
be
aware
that
any
prescription
not
literally
followed
has
but
a
light
effect
now
imprimus
it
needs
much
courage
to
be
able
to
leave
the
table
hungry
as
long
as
the
want
of
food
is
felt
one
mouthful
makes
the
succeeding
one
more
palatable
and
in
general
as
long
as
we
are
hungry
we
eat
in
spite
of
doctors
though
in
that
respect
we
follow
their
example
in
the
second
place
to
ask
obese
persons
to
rise
early
is
to
stab
them
to
the
heart
they
will
tell
you
that
their
health
will
not
suffer
them
that
when
they
rise
early
they
are
good
for
nothing
all
day
women
will
plead
exhaustion
will
consent
to
sit
up
late
and
wish
to
fatten
on
the
morning
nap
they
lose
thus
this
resource
in
the
third
place
riding
as
an
exercise
is
expensive
and
does
not
suit
every
rank
and
fortune
propose
this
to
a
female
patient
and
she
will
consent
with
joy
provided
she
have
a
gentle
but
active
horse
a
riding
dress
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
and
in
the
third
place
a
squire
who
is
young
and
handsome
it
is
difficult
to
fill
these
three
requisites
and
riding
is
thus
given
up
exercise
on
foot
is
liable
to
many
other
objections
it
is
fatiguing
produces
perspiration
and
pleurisy
dust
soils
the
shoes
and
stockings
and
it
is
given
up
if
too
the
patient
have
the
least
headache
if
a
single
shot
though
no
larger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
pierce
the
skin
it
is
all
charged
to
the
exercise
the
consequence
is
that
all
who
wish
to
diminish
embonpoint
should
eat
moderately
sleep
little
and
take
as
much
exercise
as
possible
seeking
to
accomplish
the
purpose
in
another
manner
this
method
based
on
the
soundest
principles
of
physics
and
chemistry
consists
in
a
diet
suited
to
the
effects
sought
for
of
all
medical
powers
diet
is
the
most
important
for
it
is
constant
by
night
and
day
whether
waking
or
sleeping
its
effect
is
renewed
at
every
meal
and
gradually
exerts
its
influence
on
every
portion
of
the
individual
the
antiobesic
regimen
is
therefore
indicated
by
the
most
common
causes
of
the
diseases
and
by
the
fact
that
it
has
been
shown
that
farina
or
fecula
form
fat
in
both
men
and
animals
in
the
latter
the
case
is
evident
every
day
and
from
it
we
may
deduce
the
conclusion
that
obtaining
from
farinaceous
food
will
be
beneficial
but
my
readers
of
both
sexes
will
exclaim
oh
my
god
how
cruel
the
professor
is
he
has
at
once
prescribed
all
we
like
the
white
rolls
of
limet
the
biscuit
of
achard
the
cakes
of
and
all
the
good
things
made
with
sugar
eggs
and
farina
he
will
spare
neither
potatoes
nor
macaroni
who
would
have
expected
it
from
a
man
fond
of
everything
good
what
is
that
said
i
putting
on
my
stern
look
which
i
call
up
but
once
a
year
well
eat
and
grow
fat
become
ugly
asthmatic
and
die
of
melted
fat
i
will
make
a
note
of
your
case
and
you
shall
figure
in
my
second
edition
ah
i
see
one
phrase
has
overcome
you
and
you
beg
me
to
suspend
the
thunderbolt
be
easy
i
will
prescribe
your
diet
and
prove
how
much
pleasure
is
in
the
grasp
of
one
who
lives
to
eat
you
like
bread
well
eat
the
admirable
cadet
de
vaux
long
ago
extolled
its
virtues
it
is
not
so
nourishing
and
not
so
agreeable
the
precept
will
then
be
more
easily
complied
with
to
be
sure
one
should
resist
temptation
remember
this
which
is
a
principle
of
sound
morality
you
like
soup
eat
julienne
then
with
green
vegetables
with
cabbage
and
roots
i
prohibit
soup
au
pain
pates
and
purees
eat
what
you
please
at
the
first
course
except
rice
aux
volailles
and
the
crust
of
pates
eat
well
but
circumspectly
the
second
course
will
call
for
all
your
philosophy
avoid
everything
farinacious
under
whatever
form
it
appears
you
have
yet
the
roasts
salads
and
herbacious
vegetables
now
for
the
dessert
this
is
a
new
danger
but
if
you
have
acted
prudently
so
far
you
may
survive
it
avoid
the
head
of
the
table
where
things
that
are
dangerous
to
you
are
most
apt
to
appear
do
not
look
at
either
biscuits
or
macaronies
you
have
fruits
of
all
kinds
confitures
and
much
else
that
you
may
safely
indulge
in
according
to
my
principles
after
dinner
i
prescribe
coffee
permit
you
liqueurs
and
advise
you
to
take
tea
and
punch
at
breakfast
is
a
necessity
and
take
chocolate
rather
than
coffee
i
however
permit
strong
cafe
au
lait
one
can
not
breakfast
too
soon
when
we
breakfast
late
dinner
time
comes
before
your
digestion
is
complete
you
eat
though
and
eating
without
appetite
is
often
a
great
cause
of
obesity
when
we
do
so
too
often
sequel
of
the
regimen
so
far
i
have
like
a
tender
father
marked
out
a
regimen
which
will
prevent
obesity
let
us
add
a
few
remarks
about
its
cure
drink
every
summer
thirty
bottles
of
seltzer
water
a
large
glass
in
the
morning
two
before
breakfast
and
another
at
drink
light
white
acid
wines
like
those
of
anjon
avoid
beer
as
you
would
the
plague
eat
radishes
artichokes
asparagus
etc
eat
lamb
and
chicken
in
preference
to
other
animal
food
eat
only
the
crust
of
bread
and
employ
a
doctor
who
follows
my
principles
and
as
soon
as
you
begin
you
will
find
yourself
fresher
prettier
and
better
in
every
respect
having
thus
placed
you
ashore
i
must
point
out
the
shoals
lest
in
excess
or
zeal
you
overleap
the
mark
the
shoal
i
wish
to
point
out
is
the
habitual
use
made
by
some
stupid
people
of
acids
the
bad
effects
of
which
experience
has
demonstrated
dangers
of
acids
there
is
a
current
opinion
among
women
which
every
year
causes
the
death
of
many
young
women
that
acids
especially
vinegar
are
preventives
of
obesity
beyond
all
doubts
acids
have
the
effect
of
destroying
obesity
but
they
also
destroy
health
and
freshness
lemonade
is
of
all
acids
the
most
harmless
but
few
stomachs
can
resist
it
long
the
truth
i
wish
to
announce
can
not
be
too
public
and
almost
all
of
my
readers
can
bring
forward
some
fact
to
sustain
it
i
knew
in
at
dijon
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
to
whom
i
was
attached
by
bonds
of
friendship
great
almost
as
those
of
love
one
day
when
she
had
for
some
time
gradually
grown
pale
and
thin
previously
she
had
a
delicious
embonpoint
she
told
me
in
confidence
that
as
her
young
friends
had
ridiculed
her
for
being
too
fat
she
had
to
counteract
the
tendency
been
in
the
habit
every
day
of
drinking
a
large
glass
of
vinaigre
i
shuddered
at
the
confession
and
made
every
attempt
to
avoid
the
danger
i
informed
her
mother
of
the
state
of
things
the
next
day
and
as
she
adored
her
daughter
she
was
as
much
alarmed
as
i
was
the
doctors
were
sent
for
but
in
vain
for
before
the
cause
of
her
malady
was
suspected
it
was
incurable
and
hopeless
thus
in
consequence
of
having
followed
imprudent
advice
our
amiable
louise
was
led
to
the
terrible
condition
of
marasmus
and
sank
when
scarcely
eighteen
years
old
to
sleep
forever
she
died
casting
longing
looks
towards
a
future
which
to
her
would
have
no
existence
and
the
idea
that
she
had
involuntarily
attempted
her
own
life
made
her
existence
more
prompt
and
painful
i
have
never
seen
any
one
else
die
she
breathed
her
last
in
my
arms
as
i
lifted
her
up
to
enable
her
to
see
the
day
eight
days
after
her
death
her
broken
hearted
mother
wished
me
to
visit
with
her
the
remains
of
her
daughter
and
we
saw
an
extatic
appearance
which
had
not
hitherto
been
visible
i
was
amazed
but
extracted
some
consolation
from
the
fact
this
however
is
not
strange
for
lavater
tells
of
many
such
in
his
history
of
physiogomy
antiobesic
belt
all
antiobesic
tendencies
should
be
accompanied
by
a
precaution
i
had
forgotten
it
consists
in
wearing
night
and
day
a
girdle
to
repress
the
stomach
by
moderately
clasping
it
to
cause
the
necessity
of
it
to
be
perceived
we
must
remember
that
the
vertebral
column
forming
one
of
the
walls
in
the
cavity
containing
the
intestines
is
firm
and
inflexible
whence
it
follows
that
the
excess
of
weight
which
intestines
acquire
as
soon
as
obesity
causes
them
to
deviate
from
the
vertical
line
rests
on
the
envelopes
which
compose
the
skin
of
the
stomach
the
latter
being
susceptible
of
almost
infinite
distention
would
be
unable
to
replace
themselves
when
this
effort
diminishes
if
they
did
not
have
a
mechanical
art
which
resting
on
the
dorsal
column
becomes
an
antagonist
and
restores
equilibrium
this
belt
has
therefore
the
effect
of
preventing
the
intestines
from
yielding
to
their
actual
weight
and
gives
a
power
to
contract
when
pressure
is
diminished
it
should
never
be
laid
aside
or
the
benefit
it

in
the
night
it
is
not
however
in
the
least
troublesome
and
one
soon
becomes
used
to
it
the
belt
also
shows
when
we
have
eaten
enough
and
it
should
be
made
with
great
care
and
so
contrived
as
to
diminish
as
the
embonpoint
decreases
one
is
not
forced
to
wear
it
all
life
long
and
it
may
be
laid
aside
when
the
inconvenience
is
sufficiently
reduced

suitable

however
should
be
maintained

not

six
years
quinquina
one
substance
i
think
decidedly
antiobesic
many
observations
have
induced
me
to
think
so
yet
i
leave
the
matter
in
doubt
and
submit
it
to
physicians
this
is
quinquina
ten
or
twelve
persons
that
i
know
have
had
long
intermittent
fevers
some
were
cured
by
old
women
remedies
powders
etc
others
by
the
continued
use
of
quinquina
which
is
always
effective
all
those
persons
of
the
same
category
gradually
regained
their
obesity
those
of
the
second
lost
their
embonpoint
a
circumstance
which
leaves
me
to
think
the
quinquina
which
produced
the
last
result
had
the
effect
i
speak
of
rational
theory
is
not
opposed
to
this
deduction
for
quinquina
exciting
all
the
vital
powers
may
give
the
circulation
an
impetus
which
troubles
all
and
dissipates
the
gas
destined
to
become
fat
it
is
also
shown
that
quinquina
contains
a
portion
of
tannin
which
is
powerful
enough
to
close
the
cells
which
contain
grease
it
is
possible
that
these
two
effects
sustain
each
other
these
two
ideas
the
truth
of
which
any
one
may
understand
induce
me
to
recommend
quinquina
to
all
those
who
wish
to
get
rid
of
troublesome
embonpoint
thus
dummodo

i
think
that
after
the
first
month
of
any
regimen
the
person
who
wishes
to
get
rid
of
fat
should
take
every
day
before
breakfast
a
glass
of
white
wine
in
which
was
placed
a
spoonful
of
coffee
and
red
quinquina
such
are
the
means
i
suggest
to
overcome
a
very
troublesome
affection
i
have
accommodated
them
to
human
weakness
and
to
our
manners
in
this
respect
the
experimental
truth
is
relied
on
which
teaches
that
in
proportion
as
a
regime
is
vigorous
it
is
dangerous
for
he
who
does
not
follow
it
literally
does
not
follow
it
all
great
efforts
are
rare
and
if
one
wishes
to
be
followed
men
must
be

xxiii
thinness
definition
thinness
is
the
state
of
that
individual
the
muscular
frame
of
whom
is
not
filled
up
by
strength
and
who
exhibits
all
angles
of
the
long
scaffolding
varieties
there
are
two
kinds
of
thinness
the
first
is
the
result
of
the
primitive
disposition
of
the
body
and
is
accompanied
by
health
and
a
full
use
of
the
organic
functions
of
the
body
the
second
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
some
of
the
organs
are
more
defective
than
others
and
give
the
individual
an
unhappy
and
miserable
appearance
i
once
knew
young
woman
of
moderate
stature
who
only
weighed
pounds
effects
of
thinness
thinness
is
a
matter
of
no
great
trouble
to
men
they
have
no
less
strength
and
are
far
more
active
the
father
of
the
young
woman
i
spoke
of
though
very
thin
could
seize
a
chair
by
his
teeth
and
throw
it
over
his
head
it
is
however
a
terrible
misfortune
to
women
to
whom
beauty
is
more
important
than
life
and
the
beauty
of
whom
consists
in
the
roundness
and
graceful
contour
of
their
forms
the
most
careful
toilette
the
most
sublime
can
not
hide
certain
deficiencies
it
has
been
said
that
whenever
a
pin
is
taken
from
a
thin
woman
beautiful
as
she
may
be
she
loses
some
charm
the
thin
have
therefore
no
remedy
except
from
the
interference
of
the
faculty
the
regimen
must
be
so
long
that
the
cure
must
be
slow
women
however
who
are
thin
and
who
have
a
good
stomach
are
found
to
be
as
susceptible
of
fat
as
chickens
a
little
time
only
is
necessary
for
the
stomach
of
chickens
is
comparatively
smaller
and
they
can
not
be
submitted
to
as
regular
a
diet
as
chickens
are
this
is
the
most
gentle
comparison
which
suggested
itself
to
me
i
needed
one
and
ladies
will
excuse
me
for
the
reason
for
which
i
wrote
this
chapter
natural
predestination
nature
varies
its
works
and
has
remedies
for
thinness
as
it
has
for
obesity
persons
intended
to
be
thin
are
long
drawn
out
they
have
long
hands
and
feet
legs
thin
and
the
os
coxigis
retroceding
their
sides
are
strongly
marked
their
noses
prominent
large
mouths
sharp
chins
and
brown
hair
this
is
the
general
type
the
individual
elements
may
sometimes
vary
this
however
happens
rarely
thin
people
sometimetimes
eat
a
great
deal
all
i
ever
even
talked
with
confess
that
they
digest
badly
that
is
the
reason
they
remain
thin
they
are
of
every
class
and
temperament
some
have
nothing
salient
either
in
feature
or
in
form
their
eyes
are
inexpressive
their
lips
pale
and
every
feature
denotes
a
want
of
energy
weakness
and
something
like
suffering
one
might
almost
say
they
seemed
to
be
incomplete
and
that
the
torch
of
their
lives
had
not
been
well
lighted
fattening
regimen
all
thin
women
wish
to
be
fat
this
is
a
wish
we
have
heard
expressed
a
thousand
times
to
render
then
this
last
homage
to
the
powerful
sex
we
seek
to
replace
by
folds
of
silk
and
cotton
exposed
in
fashion
shops
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
severe
who
turn
aside
and
look
away
from
them
as
they
would
from
chimeras
more
carefully
than
if
the
reality
presented
themselves
to
their
eyes
the
whole
secret
of
embonpoint
consists
in
a
suitable
diet
one
need
only
eat
and
select
suitable
food
with
this
regimen
our
disposition
to
sleep
is
almost
unimportant
if
you
do
not
take
exercise
you
will
be
exposed
to
fatness
if
you
do
you
will
yet
grow
fat
if
you
sleep
much
you
will
grow
fat
if
you
sleep
little
your
digestion
will
increase
and
you
will
eat
more
we
have
then
only
to
speak
of
the
manner
they
who
wish
to
grow
fat
should
live
this
will
not
be
difficult
according
to
the
many
directions
we
have
laid
down
to
resolve
this
problem
we
must
offer
to
the
stomach
food
which
occupies
but
does
not
fatigue
it
and
displays
to
the
assimilant
power
things
they
can
turn
into
fat
let
us
seek
to
trace
out
the
daily
diet
of
a
sylph
or
a
sylph
disposed
to
materialize
itself
general
rule
much
fresh
bread
will
be
eaten
during
the
day
and
particular
care
will
be
taken
not
to
throw
away
the
crumbs
before
eight
in
the
morning
soup
au
pain
or
aux
pates
will
be
taken
and
afterwards
a
cup
of
good
chocolate
at
eleven
breakfast
on
fresh
broiled
eggs
petit
pates
cotelettes
and
what
you
please
have
eggs
coffee
will
do
no
harm
dinner
hour
should
be
so
arranged
that
one
should
have
thoroughly
digested
before
the
time
comes
to
sit
down
at
the
table
the
eating
of
one
meal
before
another
is
digested
is
an
abuse
after
dinner
there
should
be
some
exercise
men
as
much
as
they
can
women
should
go
into
the
tuilleries
or
as
they
say
in
america
go
shopping
we
are
satisfied
that
the
little
gossip
and
conversation
they
maintain
is
very
healthful
at
times
all
should
take
as
much
soup
potage
fish
and
also
meat
cooked
with
rice
and
macaronies
pastry
creams
etc
at
dessert
such
persons
should
eat
savoy
biscuits
and
other
things
made
up
of
eggs
fecula
and
sugar
this
regimen
though
apparently
circumscribed
is
yet
susceptible
of
great
variety
it
admits
the
whole
animal
kingdom
and
great
care
is
necessarily
taken
in
the
seasoning
and
preparation
of
the
food
presented
the
object
of
this
is
to
prevent
disgust
which
prevents
any
amelioration
beer
should
be
preferred
if
not
beer
wines
from
bourdeaux
or
from
the
south
of
france
one
should
avoid
all
acids
except
salads
as
much
sugar
as
possible
should
be
put
on
fruits
and
all
should
avoid
cold
baths
one
should
seek
as
long
as
possible
to
breathe
the
pure
country
air
eat
many
grapes
when
they
are
in
season
and
never
go
to
the
ball
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
dancing
ordinarily
one
should
go
to
bed
about
eleven
and
never
under
any
circumstances
sit
up
more
than
an
hour
later
following
this
regime
resolutely
all
the
distractions
of
nature
will
soon
be
repaired
health
and
beauty
will
both
be
advanced
and
accents
of
gratitude
will
ring
in
the
ears
of
the
professor
sheep
are
fattened
as
are
oxen
lobsters
and
oysters
hence
i
deduce
the
general
maxim
viz
he
that
eats
may
be
made
fat
provided
that
the
food
be
chosen
correctly
and
according
to
the
physiology
of
the
animal

fattened

xxiv
fasting
definition
fasting
is
a
moral
abstinence
from
food
from
some
religious
or
moral
influence
though
contrary
to
our
tastes
and
habits
it
is
yet
of
the
greatest
antiquity
origin
authors
explain
the
matter
thus
in
individual
troubles
when
a
father
mother
or
beloved
child
have
died
all
the
household
is
in
mourning
the
body
is
washed
perfumed
enbalmed
and
buried
as
it
should
be
none
then
think
of
eating
but
all
fast
in
public
calamites
when
a
general
drought
appears
and
cruel
wars
or
contagious
maladies
come
we
humble
ourselves
before
the
power
that
sent
them
and
mortify
ourselves
by
abstinence
misfortune
ceases
we
become
satisfied
that
the
reason
was
that
we
fasted
and
we
continue
to
have
reference
to
such
conjectures
thus
it
is
men
afflicted
with
public
calamities
or
private
ones
always
yield
to
sadness
fail
to
take
food
and
in
the
end
make
a
voluntary
act
a
religious
one
they
fancied
they
should
macerate
their
body
when
their
soul
was
oppressed
that
they
could
excite
the
pity
of
the
gods
this
idea
seized
on
all
nations
and
filled
them
with
the
idea
of
mourning
prayers
sacrifice
abstinence
mortification
etc
christ
came
and
sanctified
fasting
all
christian
sects
since
then
have
adopted
fasting
more
or
less
as
an
obligation
how
people
used
to
fast
the
practice
of
fasting
i
am
sorry
to
say
has
become
very
rare
and
whether
for
the
education
of
the
wicked
or
for
their
conversion
i
am
glad
to
tell
how
we
fast
now
in
the
xviii
century
ordinarily
we
breakfast
before
nine
on
bread
cheese
fruit
and
cold
meats
between
one
and
two
we
take
soup
or
pot
au
feu
according
to
our
positions
about
four
there
is
a
little
lunch
kept
up
for
the
benefit
of
those
people
who
belong
to
other
ages
and
for
children
about
eight
there
was
a
regular
supper
with
entrees
roti
entremets
dessert
all
shared
in
it
and
then
went
to
bed
in
paris
there
are
always
more
magnificent
suppers
which
begin
just
after
the
play
the
persons
who
usually
attend
them
are
pretty
women
admirable
actresses
financiers
and
men
about
town
there
the
events
of
the
day
were
talked
of
the
last
new
song
was
sung
and
politics
literature
were
discussed
all
persons
devoted
themselves
especially
to
making
love
let
us
see
what
was
done
on
fast
days
no
body
breakfasted
and
therefore
all
were
more
hungry
than
usual
all
dined
as
well
as
possible
but
fish
and
vegetables
are
soon
gone
through
with
at
five
all
were
furiously
hungry
looked
at
their
watches
and
became
enraged
though
they
were
securing
their
soul
salvation
at
eight
they
had
not
a
good
supper
but
a
collation
a
word
derived
from
cloister
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
monks
used
to
assemble
to
comment
on
the
works
of
the
fathers
after
which
they
were
allowed
a
glass
of
wine
neither
butter
eggs
nor
any
thing
animal
was
served
at
these
collations
they
had
to
be
satisfied
with
salads
confitures
and
meats
a
very
unsatisfactory
food
to
such
appetites
at
that
time
they
went
to
bed
however
and
lived
in
hope
as
long
as
the
fast
lasted
those
who
ate
these
little
suppers
i
am
assured
never
fasted
the
of
a
kitchen
of
those
days
i
am
assured
was
a
strictly
apostolic
collation
which
however
was
very
like
a
good
supper
science
soon
resolved
this
problem
by
the
recognition
of
fish
soups
and
pastry
made
with
oil
the
observing
of
fasting
gave
rise
to
an
unknown
pleasure
that
of
the
easter
celebration
a
close
observation
shows
that
the
elements
of
our
enjoyment
are
difficult
privation
desire
and
gratification
all
of
these
are
found
in
the
breaking
of
abstinence
i
have
seen
two
of
my
grand
uncles
very
excellent
men
too
almost
faint
with
pleasure
when
on
the
day
after
easter
they
saw
a
ham
or
a
pate
brought
on
the
table
a
degenerate
race
like
the
present
experiences
no
such
sensation
origin
of
the
removal
of
restriction
in
fasting
i
witnessed
the
rise
of
this
it
advanced
by
almost
insensible
degrees
young
persons
of
a
certain
age
were
not
forced
to
fast
nor
were
pregnant
women
or
those
who
thought
themselves
so
when
in
that
condition
a
soup
a
very
great
temptation
to
those
who
were
well
was
served
to
them
then
people
began
to
find
out
that
fasting
disagreed
with
them
and
kept
them
awake
all
the
little
accidents
man
is
subject
to
were
then
attributed
to
it
so
that
people
did
not
fast
because
they
thought
themselves
sick
or
that
they
would
be
so
collations
thus
gradually
became
rarer
this
was
not
all
some
winters
were
so
severe
that
people
began
to
fear
a
scarcity
of
vegetables
and
the
ecclesiastical
power
officially
relaxed
its
rigor
the
duty
however
was
recognised
and
permission
was
always
asked
the
priests
were
refused
it
but
enjoined
the
necessity
of
extra
alms
giving
the
revolution
came
which
occupied
the
minds
of
all
that
none
thought
of
priests
who
were
looked
on
as
enemies
to
the
state
this
cause
does
not
exist
but
a
new
one
has
intervened
the
hour
of
our
meals
is
totally
changed
we
do
not
eat
so
often
and
a
totally
different
household
arrangement
would
be
required
for
fasting
this
is
so
true
that
i
think
i
may
safely
say
though
i
visit
none
but
the
best
regulated
houses
that
except
at
home
i
have
not
seen
a
lenten
table
or
a
collation
ten
times
in
five
years
we
will
not
finish
this
chapter
without
observing
the
new
direction
popular
taste
has
taken
thousands
of
men
who
forty
years
ago
would
have
passed
their
evenings
in
cabarets
now
pass
them
at
the
theatres
economy
certainly
does
not
gain
by
this
but
morality
does
manners
are
improved
at
the
play
and
at
cafes
one
sees
the
journals
one
certainly
escapes
the
quarrels
diseases
and
degradation
which
infallibly
result
from
the
habit
of
frequenting
cabarets

exhaustion
by
exhaustion
a
state
of
weakness
languor
or
depression
caused
by
previous
circumstances
is
understood
rendering
the
exercise
of
the
vital
functions
more
difficult
there
are
various
kinds
of
exhaustion
caused
by
mental
labor
bodily
toil
and
the
abuse
of
certain
faculties
one
great
remedy
is
to
lay
aside
the
acts
which
have
produced
this
state
which
if
not
a
disease
approximates
closely
to
one
treatment
after
these
indispensable
preliminaries
gastronomy
is
ready
with
its
resources
when
a
man
is
overcome
by
too
long
fatigue
it
offers
him
a
good
soup
generous
wine
flesh
and
sleep
to
a
savant
led
into
debility
by
a
too
great
exercise
of
his
mental
faculties
it
prescribes
fresh
air
a
bath
fowl
and
vegetables
the
following
observation
will
explain
how
i
effected
a
cure
of
another
kind
of
exhaustion
the
translator
thinks
it
best
not
to
translate
this
anecdote
but
merely
to
append
the
original
cure
by
the
professor
un

perire
god
has
subjected
man
to
six
great
necessities
birth
action
eating
sleep
reproduction
and
death
death
is
the
absolute
interruption
of
the
sensual
relations
and
the
absolute
annihilation
of
the
vital
powers
which
abandons
the
body
to
the
laws
of
decomposition
these
necessities
are
all
accompanied
and
softened
by
a
sensation
of
pleasure
and
even
death
when
j
natural
is
not
without
charms
we
mean
when
a
man
has
passed
through
the
different
phases
of
growth
virility
old
age
and
decrepitude
had
i
not
determined
to
make
this
chapter
very
short
i
would
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
physicians
who
have
observed
every
shade
of
the
transition
of
a
living
to
an
inert
body
i
would
quote
philosophers
kings
men
of
letters
men
who
while
on
the
verge
of
eternity
had
pleasant
thoughts
they
decked
in
the
graces
i
would
recall
the
dying
answer
of
fontinelle
who
being
asked
what
he
felt
said
nothing
but
the
pain
of
life
i
prefer
however
merely
to
express
my
opinion
founded
on
analogy
as
sustained
by
many
instances
of
which
the
following
is
the
last
i
had
a
great
aunt
aged
when
she
died
though
she
had
long
been
confined
to
her
bed
she
preserved
all
her
faculties
and
the
approach
of
death
was
perceived
by
the
feebleness
of
her
voice
and
the
failing
of
her
appetite
she
had
always
exhibited
great
devotion
to
me
and
i
sat
by
her
anxious
to
attend
on
her
this
however
did
not
prevent
my
observing
her
with
most
philosophic
attention
are
you
there
nephew
said
she
in
an
almost
inaudible
voice
yes
aunt
i
think
you
would
be
better
if
you
would
take
a
little
old
wine
give
it
to
me
liquids
always
run
down
i
hastened
to
lift
her
up
and
gave
her
half
a
glass
of
my
best
and
oldest
wine
she
revived
for
a
moment
and
said
i
thank
you
if
you
live
as
long
as
i
have
lived
you
will
find
that
death
like
sleep
is
a
necessity
these
were
her
last
words
and
in
half
an
hour
she
had
sank
to
sleep
forever
richerand
has
described
with
so
much
truth
the
gradations
of
the
human
body
and
the
last
moments
of
the
individual
that
my
readers
will
be
obliged
to
me
for
this
passage
thus
the
intellectual
faculties
are
decomposed
and
pass
away
reason
the
attribute
of
which
man
pretends
to
be
the
exclusive
possessor
first
deserts
him
he
then
loses
the
power
of
combining
his
judgment
and
soon
after
that
of
comparing
assembling
combining
and
joining
together
many
ideas
they
say
then
that
the
invalid
loses
his
mind
that
he
is
delirious
all
this
usually
rests
on
ideas
familiar
to
the
individual
the
dominant
passion
is
easily
recognized
the
miser
talks
most
wildly
about
his
treasures
and
another
person
is
besieged
by
religious
terrors
after
reasoning
and
judgment
the
faculty
of
association
becomes
lost
this
takes
place
in
the
cases
known
as
defaillances
to
which
i
have
myself
been
liable
i
was
once
talking
with
a
friend
and
met
with
an
insurmountable
difficulty
in
combining
two
ideas
from
which
i
wished
to
make
up
an
opinion
the
syncopy
was
not
however
complete
for
memory
and
sensation
remained
i
heard
the
persons
around
me
say
distinctly
he
is
fainting
and
sought
to
arouse
me
from
this
condition
which
was
not
without
pleasure
memory
then
becomes
extinct
the
patient
who
in
his
delirium
recognized
his
friends
now
fails
even
to
know
those
with
whom
he
had
been
on
terms
of
the
greatest
intimacy
he
then
loses
sensation
but
the
senses
go
out
in
a
successive
and
determinate
order
taste
and
smell
give
no
evidence
of
their
existence
the
eyes
become
covered
with
a
mistful
veil
and
the
ear
ceases
to
execute
its
functions
for
that
reason
the
ancients
to
be
sure
of
the
reality
of
death
used
to
utter
loud
cries
in
the
ears
of
the
dying
he
neither
tastes
sees
nor
hears
he
yet
retains
the
sense
of
touch
moves
in
his
bed
changes
the
position
of
the
arms
and
body
every
moment
and
has
motions
analogous
to
those
of
the
foetus
in
the
womb
death
affects
him
with
no
terror
for
he
has
no
ideas
and
he
ends

he

philosophical
history
of
the
kitchen
cookery
is
the
most
ancient
of
arts
for
adam
must
have
been
born
hungry
and
the
cries
of
the
infant
are
only
soothed
by
the
mother
breast
of
all
the
arts
it
is
the
one
which
has
rendered
the
greatest
service
in
civil
life
the
necessities
of
the
kitchen
taught
us
the
use
of
fire
by
which
man
has
subdued
nature
looking
carefully
at
things
three
kinds
of
cuisine
may
be
discovered
the
first
has
preserved
its
primitive
name
the
second
analyzes
and
looks
after
elements
it
is
called
chemistry
the
third
is
the
cookery
of
separation
and
is
called
pharmacy
though
different
objects
they
are
all
united
by
the
fact
that
they
use
fire
furnaces
at
the
same
time
thus
a
morsel
of
beef
which
the
cook
converts
into
potage
or
bouilli
the
chemist
uses
to
ascertain
into
how
many
substances
it
may
be
resolved
order
of
alimentation
man
is
an
omnivorous
animal
he
has
incisors
to
divide
fruits
molar
teeth
to
crush
grain
and
canine
teeth
for
flesh
let
it
he
remarked
however
that
as
man
approaches
the
savage
state
the
canine
teeth
are
more
easily
distinguishable
the
probability
was
that
the
human
race
for
a
long
time
lived
on
fruit
for
it
is
the
most
ancient
food
of
the
human
race
and
his
means
of
attack
until
he
had
acquired
the
use
of
arms
are
very
limited
the
instinct
of
perfection
attached
to
his
nature
however
soon
became
developed
and
the
sentiment
attached
to
his
instinct
was
soon
exhibited
and
he
made
weapons
for
himself
to
this
he
was
impelled
by
a
carniverous
instinct
and
he
began
to
make
prey
of
the
animals
that
surrounded
him
this
instinct
of
destruction
yet
exists
children
always
kill
the
animals
that
surround
them
and
if
they
were
hungry
would
devour
them
it
is
not
strange
that
man
seeks
to
feed
on
flesh
he
has
too
small
a
stomach
and
fruit
has
not
nourishment
enough
to
renovate
him
he
could
subsist
on
vegetables
but
their
preparation
requires
an
art
only
reached
after
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
man
first
weapons
were
the
branches
of
trees
and
subsequently
bows
and
arrows
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
wherever
we
find
man
in
all
climates
and
latitudes
he
has
been
found
with
and
arrows
none
can
see
how
this
idea
presented
itself
to
individuals
so
differently
placed
it
must
be
hidden
by
the
veil
of
centuries
raw
flesh
has
but
one
inconvenience
its
viscousness
attaches
itself
to
the
teeth
it
is
not
however
disagreeable
when
seasoned
with
salt
it
is
easily
digested
and
must
be
digestible
a
croat
captain
whom
i
invited
to
dinner
in
was
amazed
at
my
preparations
he
said
to
me
when
in
campaign
and
we
become
hungry
we
knock
over
the
first
animal
we
find
cut
off
a
steak
powder
it
with
salt
which
we
always
have
in
the
sabretasche
put
it
under
the
saddle
gallop
over
it
for
half
a
mile
and
then
dine
like
princes
when
the
huntsmen
of
dauphiny
go
out
in
septemher
to
shoot
they
take
both
pepper
and
salt
with
them
if
they
kill
a
very
fat
bird
they
pluck
season
it
carry
it
some
time
in
their
caps
and
eat
it
they
say
it
is
the
best
way
to
serve
it
up
if
our
ancestors
ate
raw
food
we
have
not
entirely
gotten
rid
of
the
habit
the
most
delicate
palates
like
aries
sausages
which
have
never
been
cooked
but
which
are
not
on
that
account
the
less
appetising
discovery
of
fire
subsequently
to
the
croat
mode
fire
was
discovered
this
was
an
accident
for
fire
is
not
spontaneous
many
savage
nations
have
been
found
utterly
ignorant
of
it
baking
fire
having
been
discovered
it
was
made
use
of
to
perfect
food
at
first
it
was
made
use
of
to
dry
it
and
then
to
cook
it
meat
thus
treated
was
found
better
than
when
raw
it
had
more
firmness
was
eaten
with
less
difficulty
and
the
osmazome
as
it
was
condensed
by
carbonization
gave
it
a
pleasing
perfume
they
began
however
to
find
out
that
flesh
cooked
on
the
coals
became
somewhat
befouled
for
certain
portions
of
coal
will
adhere
to
it
this
was
remedied
by
passing
spits
through
it
and
placing
it
above
burning
coals
at
a
suitable
height
thus
grillades
were
invented
and
they
have
a
flavor
as
rich
as
it
is
simple
all
grilled
meat
is
highly
flavored
for
it
must
be
partially
distilled
things
in
homer
time
had
not
advanced
much
further
and
all
will
be
pleased
here
to
read
the
account
of
achilles
reception
of
the
three
leading
greeks
one
of
whom
was
royal
i
dedicate
this
story
to
the
ladies
for
achilles
was
the
handsomest
of
all
the
greeks
and
his
pride
did
not
prevent
his
weeping
when
briseis
was
taken
from
him
viz
verse
in
greek
the
following
is
a
translation
by
pope
patroclus
crown
a
larger
bowl
mix
purer
wine
and
open
every
soul
of
all
the
warriors
yonder
host
can
send
thy
friend
most
honours
these
and
these
thy
friend
he
said
patroclus
the
blazing
fire
heaps
in
a
brazen
vase
three
chines
entire
the
brazen
vase
automedon
sustains
flesh
of
porket
sheep
and
goat
contains
achilles
at
the
genial
feast
presides
the
parts
transfixes
and
with
skill
divides
meanwhile
patroclus
sweats
the
fire
to
raise
the
tent
is
brightened
with
the
rising
blaze
then
when
the
languid
flames
at
length
subside
he
strews
a
bed
of
glowing
embers
wide
above
the
coals
the
smoking
fragments
turns
and
sprinkles
sacred
salt
from
lifted
urns
with
bread
the
glittering
canisters
they
load
which
round
the
board
son
bestow
himself
opposed
to
ulysses
full
in
sight
each
portion
parts
and
orders
every
rite
the
first
fat
offerings
to
the
immortals
due
amid
the
greedy
patroclus
threw
then
each
indulging
in
the
social
feast
his
thirst
and
hunger
soberly
repress
that
done
to
phoenix
ajax
gave
the
sign
not
unperceived
ulysses
crown
with
wine
the
foaming
bowl
and
instant
thus
began
his
speech
addressing
to
the
godlike
man
health
to
achilles
thus
then
a
king
a
son
of
a
king
and
three
grecian
leaders
dined
very
comfortably
on
bread
wine
and
broiled
meat
we
can
not
but
think
that
achilles
and
patroclus
themselves
prepared
the
entertainment
if
only
to
do
honor
to
the
distinguished
guests
they
received
ordinarily
the
kitchen
business
was
abandoned
to
slaves
and
women
as
homer
tells
us
in
odyssey
when
he
refers
to
the
entertainment
of
the
heralds
the
entrails
of
animals
stuffed
with
blood
were
at
that
time
looked
on
as
very
great
delicacies
at
that
time
and
long
before
beyond
doubt
poetry
and
music
were
mingled
with
meals
famous
minstrels
sang
the
wonders
of
nature
the
loves
of
the
gods
and
warlike
deeds
of
man
theirs
was
a
kind
of
priesthood
and
it
is
probable
that
the
divine
homer
himself
was
sprung
from
one
of
those
men
favored
by
heaven
he
would
not
have
been
so
eminent
had
not
his
poetical
studies
begun
in
his
childhood
madame
dacier
observes
that
homer
does
not
speak
of
boiled
meat
anywhere
in
his
poems
the
jews
had
made
much
greater
progress
in
consequence
of
their
captivity
in
egypt
they
had
kettles
mess
of
potage
must
have
been
made
thus
for
this
he
sold
his
birthright
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
men
learned
the
use
of
metals
tubal
cain
it
is
said
was
the
inventor
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
we
use
one
metal
to
manufacture
another
we
overcome
them
with
iron
pincers
cut
them
with
steel
files
but
i
never
met
with
any
one
who
could
tell
me
who
made
the
first
file
or
pair
of
pincers
oriental
grecian
cookery
made
great
advances
we
are
ignorant
however
of
its
utensils
whether
of
iron
pottery
or
of
tin
material
the
oldest
books
we
know
of
make
honorable
mention
of
oriental
festivals
it
is
not
difficult
to
believe
that
monarchs
who
ruled
such
glorious
realms
abounded
in
all
that
was
grateful
we
only
know
that
cadmus
who
introduced
writing
into
greece
was
cook
of
the
king
of
sidon
the
idea
of
surrounding
the
table
with
couches
originated
from
this
voluptuous
prince
cookery
and
its
flavors
were
then
highly
esteemed
by
the
athenians
a
people
fond
of
all
that
was
new
from
what
we
read
in
their
histories
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
their
festivals
were
true
feasts
the
wines
of
greece
which
even
now
we
find
excellent
have
been
estimated
by
scientific
gourmands
the
most
delicious
that
were
the
most
beautiful
women
that
ever
came
to
adorn
our
entertainments
were
greeks
or
of
grecian
origin
the
wisest
men
of
old
were
anxious
to
display
the
luxury
of
such
enjoyments
plato
atheneus
and
many
others
have
preserved
their
names
the
works
of
all
of
them
however
are
lost
and
if
any
remember
them
it
is
only
those
who
have
heard
of
a
long
forgotten
and
lost
book
the
gastronomy
greek
word
the
friend
of
one
of
the
sons
of
pericles
such
was
the
cookery
of
greece
which
sent
forth
a
few
men
who
first
established
themselves
in
the
tiber
and
then
took
possession
of
the
world
roman
festivals
good
cheer
was
unknown
to
the
romans
as
long
as
they
thought
to
preserve
their
independence
or
to
overcome
their
neighbors
who
were
poor
as
they
were
their
generals
therefore
lived
on
vegetables
historians
have
never
failed
to
praise
these
times
when
frugality
was
a
matter
of
honor
when
however
their
conquests
had
extended
into
africa
sicily
and
hellas
when
they
had
to
live
as
people
did
where
civilization
was
more
advanced
they
brought
back
to
rome
the
tastes
which
had
attended
them
in
foreign
lands
the
romans
sent
to
athens
a
deputation
charged
to
bring
back
the
laws
of
solon
they
also
sent
them
thither
to
study
belles
lettres
and
philosophy
while
their
manners
became
polished
they
became
aware
of
the
attractions
of
festivals
and
poets
philosophers
orators
all
came
to
rome
at
once
as
time
advanced
and
as
the
series
of
events
attracted
to
rome
almost
all
the
riches
of
the
world
the
luxury
of
the
table
became
incredible
every
thing
was
eaten
the
and
the
ostrich
the
squirrel
and
the
all
imaginable
vegetables
were
put
in
requisition
armies
and
travellers
put
all
the
world
in
requisition
the
most
distinguished
roman
citizens
took
pleasure
not
only
in
the
cultivation
of
fruits
once
known
such
as
pears
apples
but
sought
out
things
lucullus
never
dreamed
of
these
importations
which
naturally
had
a
great
influence
prove
at
least
that
the
impulse
was
general
that
each
one
sought
to
contribute
to
the
enjoyment
of
those
around
him
our
drinks
were
not
the
object
of
less
attention
nor
of
less
attentive
cares
the
romans
were
delighted
with
the
wines
of
italy
greece
and
sicily
as
they
estimated
their
value
from
the
year
in
which
they
were
made
we
may
understand
cicero
much
abused
line
oh
tortuna

roman
this
was
not
all
in
consequence
of
an
instinct
hitherto
referred
to
an
effort
was
made
to
make
them
more
highly
perfumed
and
flowers
aromatics
were
infused
such
things
which
the
romans
called
condita
must
have
had
a
very
bad
effect
on
the
stomach
thus
the
romans
came
to
dream
of
alcohol
which
was
not
discovered
until
long
after
they
were
born
resurrection
of
lucullus
the
glorious
days
of
old
might
arise
again
and
nothing
but
a
lucullus
is
needed
to
bring
this
about
let
us
fancy
that
any
man
known
to
be
rich
should
wish
to
celebrate
any
great
act
and
give
in
this
manner
an
occasion
for
a
famous
entertainment
let
us
suppose
that
he
appeals
to
every
one
to
adorn
his
entertainment
and
orders
every
possible
resource
to
be
prepared
let
him
make
every
imaginable
preparation
and
lucullus
would
be
as
nothing
compared
with
the
civilized
world
as
it
is
both
the
romans
and
the
athenians
had
beds
to
eat
on
they
achieved
the
purpose
but
indirectly
at
first
they
used
beds
only
for
the
sacred
festivals
offered
to
the
gods
the
magistrates
and
principal
men
adopted
the
custom
and
ere
long
it
became
general
and
was
preserved
until
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
these
couches
were
at
first
only
boxes
filled
with
straw
and
covered
with
skins
gradually
however
they
became
more
luxurious
and
were
made
of
the
most
precious
woods
inlaid
with
ivory
and
sometimes
with
gems
their
cushions
were
soft
and
their
covers
magnificently
embroidered
people
only
laid
down
on
the
left
elbow
three
usually
slept
together
this
the
romans
called
lectisternium
it
is
not
a
very
bad
name
in
a
physical
point
of
view
incubitation
demands
a
certain
exhibition
of
power
to
preserve
equlibrium
and
is
not
without
a
degree
of
pain
the
elbow
supporting
an
undue
proportion
of
the
weight
of
the
body
in
a
physiological
point
of
view
something
also
is
to
be
said
imbuccation
swallowing
is
effected
in
a
less
natural
manner
the
food
is
passed
with
more
difficulty
into
the
stomach
the
ingestion
of
liquids
or
drinking
is
yet
more
difficult
it
required
particular
attention
not
to
spill
the
wine
from
the
large
cups
on
the
tables
of
the
great
thence
came
the
proverb
between
the
cup
and
lip
there
is
often
time
a
slip
none
could
eat
comfortably
when
reclining
especially
when
we
remember
that
many
of
the
guests
had
long
beards
and
that
fingers
or
at
least
only
knives
were
used
forks
are
an
invention
of
modern
times
for
none
were
found
at
herculaeneum
some
violations
of
modesty
must
also
have
occurred
at
repasts
which
frequently
exceeded
the
bounds
of
temperance
and
where
the
two
sexes
have
fallen
asleep
and
were
mingled
together
a
poet
says
nam
pransus
jaceo
et
satur
supinus
pertimdo
tunicamque
palliumque
when
christianity
had
acquired
some
power
its
priests
lifted
up
their
voices
against
intemperance
they
declaimed
against
the
length
of
meals
which
violated
all
prudence
by
surrounding
persons
by
every
species
of
voluptuousness
devoted
by
choice
to
an
austere
regimen
they
placed
gourmandise
in
the
list
of
capital
sins
and
rigidly
commented
on
the
mingling
of
sexes
and
the
use
of
beds
a
habit
which
they
said
produced
the
luxury
they
deplored
their
menacing
voice
was
heard
couches
disappeared
and
the
old
habit
of
eating
sitting
was
restored
fortunately
this
did
not
violate
the
demands
of
pleasure
poetry
convivial
poetry
then
underwent
a
new
modification

xxviii
restaurateurs
a
restaurateur
is
one
the
business
of
whom
is
to
offer
a
dinner
always
ready
and
with
prices
to
suit
those
that
consume
them
of
all
those
who
frequent
restaurants
few
persons
can
not
understand
that
a
restorateur
is
not
necessarily
a
man
of
genius
we
shall
follow
out
the
affiliation
of
ideas
which
has
led
to
the
present
state
of
affairs
establishment
about
after
the
glorious
days
of
louis
and
the
frolics
and
tranquility
of
the
regency
of
cardinal
fleury
foreigners
had
few
means
of
good
cheer
they
were
forced
to
have
recourse
to
the
cookery
of
whom
was
generally
very
bad
a
few
hotels
kept
a
table
which
generally
contained
only
what
was
very
necessary
and
which
was
always
ready
at
an
appointed
hour
the
people
we
speak
of
only
ordered
whole
joints
or
dishes
and
consequently
such
an
order
of
things
could
not
last
at
last
a
man
of
sense
arose
who
thought
that
an
active
cause
must
have
its
effect
that
as
the
same
want
sent
people
every
day
to
his
house
consumers
would
come
whenever
they
were
satisfied
that
they
would
be
served
they
saw
that
if
a
wing
was
cut
from
a
fowl
for
one
person
some
one
would
be
sure
to
taste
the
thigh
the
separation
of
one
limb
would
not
injure
the
flavor
of
the
rest
of
the
animal
more
pay
the
least
attention
to
the
increase
of
prices
when
one
considers
the
prompt
service
of
what
was
served
this
man
thought
of
many
things
which
we
may
now
easily
devise
the
one
who
did
so
was
the
first
restaurateur
and
the
inventor
of
a
business
which
is
a
fortune
to
all
who
exercise
it
promptly
and
honorably
the
translator
here
omits
a
whole
chapter
from
the
examination
of
the
bills
of
fare
of
different
restaurants
any
one
who
sets
down
at
the
table
has
the
choice
of
the
following
dishes
soups
side
dishes
or
preparations
of
beef
of
mutton
of
fowl
or
game
or
of
veal
of
pastry
of
fish
roasts
side
dishes
desserts
besides
the
fortunate
gastronomer
has
thirty
kinds
of
wine
to
select
from
passing
over
the
whole
scale
from
burgundy
to
tokay
and
constantia
and
twenty
various
kinds
of
essences
without
taking
into
consideration
such
mixed
drinks
as
punch
negus
sillabubs
and
the
like
of
the
various
parts
of
a
good
dinner
many
are
indigenous
such
as
butcher
meat
fowl
and
fruits
others
for
instance
the
stake
welch
punch
were
invented
in
england
germany
spain
italy
holland
all
contribute
as
does
india
persia
arabia
and
each
pay
their
quota
in
raisins
parmera
bolognas
curacao
rice
sago
soy
potatoes
etc
the
consequence
is
that
a
parisian
dinner
is
perfectly
cosmopolitan
the
translator
here
omits
two
meditations
which
refer
exclusively
to
paris
is
few
frenchmen
now
would
understand
them
and
none
but
a
frenchman
could

part
second
transition
if
i
have
been
read
with
the
attention
i
wished
all
must
have
seen
that
i
had
a
double
purpose
in
view
the
first
was
to
establish
the
theoretical
basis
of
gastronomy
so
as
to
place
it
among
sciences
where
it
should
doubtless
be
the
second
was
to
define
gourmandise
and
to
separate
this
social
character
as
free
from
gluttony
and
intemperance
with
which
it
is
often
confounded
this
equivoque
has
been
introduced
by
intolerant
moralists
who
deceived
by
too
much
zeal
saw
excesses
where
there
was
only
innocent
enjoyment
the
treasures
of
creation
were
not
made
to
be
trodden
under
the
feet
it
was
afterwards
propagated
by
grammarians
who
defined
it
as
blind
men
do
and
who
swore
in
verba
magistri
it
is
time
that
such
an
error
should
cease
for
now
all
the
world
understand
each
other
this
is
true
for
there
never
was
a
person
who
would
not
confess
to
some
tincture
of
gourmandise
and
even
would
not
boast
of
it
none
however
would
not
look
on
gluttony
as
an
insult
just
as
they
do
on
intemperance
and
voracity
about
these
two
cardinal
points
it
seems
that
what
i
have
described
should
satisfy
all
those
who
do
not
refuse
conviction
i
might
then
lay
down
my
pen
and
look
on
the
task
i
have
imposed
on
myself
as
finished
as
however
i
approached
those
subjects
which
belong
to
every
thing
i
remembered
many
things
which
it
did
not
seem
to
me
fit
to
write
such
as
anecdotes
bon
mots
recipes
and
other
odd
things
had
they
been
put
in
the
theoretical
portion
of
the
book
they
would
have
taken
the
connection
place
them
all
together
they
will
not
be
disadvantageous
because
they
contain
some
experimental
truths
and
useful
explanations
i
have
also
inserted
personal
biography
but
when
i
read
them
over
i
feel
to
a
degree
uneasy
this
anxiety
originated
in
my
last
lectures
and
glossaries
which
are
in
the
hands
of
every
body
i
think
however
that
i
may
be
tranquil
having
sheltered
myself
under
the
mantle
of
philosophy
i
insist
that
my
enemies
have
uneasy
consciences
and
sleep
badly
varieties
du
cure
all
know
that
twenty
years
ago
madame
r
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
paris
all
know
that
she
was
very
charitable
and
took
an
interest
in
the
various
enterprises
the
object
of
which
was
the
alleviation
of
misery
perhaps
greater
in
the
capital
than
elsewhere
having
business
with
the
cure
of
she
went
thither
about
five
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
at
dinner
she
believed
that
every
body
dined
at
six
and
was
not
aware
that
ecclesiastics
dined
earlier
from
the
fact
that
they
were
used
to
take
light
collations
madame
r
wished
to
retire
but
the
cure
would
not
permit
her
to
do
so
either
because
the
matter
under
discussion
would
not
interrupt
conversation
or
that
a
pretty
woman
never
disturbs
any
entertainment
the
table
was
very
well
arranged
old
wine
sparkled
in
a
chrystal
flagon
and
the
porcelain
was
faultless
the
plates
were
kept
hot
by
boiling
water
and
an
old
housekeeper
was
in
attendance
the
meal
was
half
way
between
luxury
and
abstinence
a
soup
of
ecrevisses
was
removed
and
a
salmon
trout
an
omelette
and
a
salad
were
placed
on
the
table
my
dinner
tells
you
said
the
priest
what
you
do
not
know
that
to
day
is
a
fast
day
my
friend
assented
with
a
blush
they
began
with
the
trout
the
shoulders
of
which
were
soon
eaten
the
sauce
was
made
by
a
competent
person
and
the
pastor
brow
was
irradiated
with
joy
then
the
omelette
which
was
round
and
done
to
a
point
was
attached
as
soon
as
the
spoon
touched
it
the
odor
and
perfume
it
contained
escaped
and
my
friend
owns
that
it
made
her
mouth
water
the
curel
had
a
sympathetic
movement
for
he
was
used
to
watch
my
passions
in
reply
to
a
question
he
saw
madame
r
was
about
to
ask
he
said
it
is
an
omelette

my
cook
understands
them
simply
and
few
people
ever
taste
them
without
complimenting
her
i
am
not
amazed
said
his
lady
guest
for
i
never
ate
anything
so
delightful
then
came
the
salad
i
recommend
it
to
those
who
have
confidence
in
me
it
refreshes
without
exciting
i
think
it
makes
people
younger
dinner
did
not
interrupt
conversation
they
talked
of
the
affair
which
had
occasioned
the
visit
of
the
war
of
business
of
other
things
which
made
a
bad
dinner
passably
good
the
dessert
came
it
consisted
of
septmoncel
cheese
of
apples
and
preserves
at

the
brought
forward
a
little
round

such
as
once
was

passed

to
subject
but
i
as
a
philosopher
thought
the
secret
of
the
preparation
of
such
a
dish
must
be
valuable
i
ordered
my
cook
to
obtain
the
recipe
in
its
most
minute
details
i
publish
it
the
more
willingly
now
because
i
never

footnote
the
translator
has
followed
this
recipe
with
shad
pike
pickerel
and
can
recommend
it
with
a
quiet
conscience
any
fish
is
a
substitute
for
tunny
and
steep
them
for
a
few
minutes
in
salt
water
just
below
boiling
point
put
in
also
a
fresh
tunny
about
as
large
as
an
egg
to
which
you
must
add
a
charlotte
minced
mix
the
tunny
and
the
roes
together
and
put
the
whole
in
a
kettle
with
a
portion
of
good
butter
and
keep
it
on
the
fire
until
the
butter
has
melted
this
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
omelette
take
then
another
piece
of
butter
and
mix
it
with
parsely
and
sage
put
it
in
the
dish
intended
to
receive
the
omelette
cover
it
with
lemon
juice
and
put
it
on
hot
coals
then
beat
twelve
eggs
fresh
as
possible
pour
in
the
fish
and
roe
so
that
all
may
be
perfectly
mixed
then
cook
the
omelette
as
usual
making
it
thin
and
firm
serve
it
up
hot
this
dish
should
be
reserved
for
breakfasts
where
all
the
guests
are
connoisseurs
it
is
caviare
to
the
vulgar
observations
the
roes
and
fish
should
be
warmed
not
boiled
they
will
thus
mingle
more
easily
with
the
eggs
the
plate
should
be
deep
it
should
be
warm
for
a
cold
porcelain
plate
would
extract
the
caloric
of
the
omelette
and
make
it
insipid
ii
a
national
victory
when
i
lived
in
new
york
i
used
every
once
in
a
while
to
pass
the
evening
in
a
kind
of
tavern
kept
by
a
man
named
little
the
old
lank
coffee
house
where
one
could
always
get
turtle
soup
and
all
the
dishes
common
in
the
united
states
i
often
went
thither
with
the
vicomte
de
la
massue
and
fehr
an
old
broker
of
marsailles
all
three
of
us
were
emigrants
and
we
used
to
drink
ale
and
cider
and
pass
the
evening
very
pleasantly
together
there
i
became
acquainted
with
a
wilkinson
who
was
a
native
of
jamaica
and
a
person
he
was
very
intimate
with
for
he
never
left
him
the
latter
the
name
of
whom
i
do
not
remember
was
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
men
i
ever
met
he
had
a
square
face
keen
eyes
and
appeared
to
look
attentively
at
everything
though
his
features
were
motionless
as
those
of
a
blind
man
when
he
laughed
it
was
with
what
the
english
call
a
and
immediately
resumed
his
habitual
taciturnity
wilkinson
seemed
about
forty
and
in
manner
and
appearance
seemed
to
be
a
gentleman
the
englishman
seemed
to
like
our
company
and
more
than
once
shared
the
frugal
entertainment
i
offered
my
friends
when
wilkinson
took
me
one
evening
aside
and
said
he
intended
to
ask
us
all
to
dine
with
him
i
accepted
the
invitation
for
three
on
the
third
day
after
the
evening
passed
quietly
enough
but
when
i
was
about
to
leave
a
waiter
came
to
me
and
said
that
the
west
indian
had
ordered
a
magnificent
dinner
thinking
their
invitation
a
challenge
the
man
with
the
had
undertaken
to
drink
us
frenchmen
drunk
this
intelligence
would
have
induced
me
if
possible
to
decline
the
banquet
it
was
however
impossible
and
following
the
advice
of
the
marshal
de
saxe
we
determined
as
the
wine
was
uncorked
to
drink
it
i
had
some
anxiety
but
being
satisfied
that
my
constitution
was
young
healthy
and
sound
i
could
easily
get
the
better
of
the
west
indian
who
probably
was
unused
to
liquors
i
however
went
to
see
fehr
and
massue
and
in
an
occular
allocution
told
them
of
my
plans
i
advised
them
to
drink
as
little
as
possible
and
to
avoid
too
many
glasses
while
i
talked
to
our
antagonists
above
all
things
i
advised
them
to
keep
up
some
appetite
telling
them
that
food
had
the
effect
of
moderating
the
fumes
of
wine
thus
physically
and
morally
armed
we
went
to
the
old
bank
coffee
house
where
we
found
our
friends
dinner
was
soon
ready
it
consisted
of
a
huge
piece
of
beef
a
roasted
turkey
plain
boiled
vegetables
a
salad
and
pastry
wine
was
put
on
the
table
it
was
claret
very
good
and
cheaper
than
it
then
was
in
france
wilkinson
did
the
honors
perfectly
asking
us
to
eat
and
setting
us
an
example
while
his
friend
who
seemed
busy
with
his
plate
did
nothing
but
laugh
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
my
countrymen
delighted
me
by
their
discretion
after
the
claret
came
the
port
and
madeira
to
the
latter
we
paid
great
attention
then
came
the
dessert
composed
of
butter
cheese
and
hickory
nuts
then
came
the
time
for
toasts
and
we
drank
to
our
kings
to
human
liberty
and
to
wilkinson
daughter
maria
who
was
as
he
said
the
prettiest
woman
in
jamaica
then
came
spirits
rum
brandy
etc
then
came
songs
and
i
saw
things
were
getting
warm
i
was
afraid
of
brandy
and
asked
for
punch
little
brought
a
bowl
which
doubtless
he
had
prepared
before
it
held
enough
for
forty
people
and
was
larger
than
any
we
have
in
france
this
gave
me
courage
i
ate
five
or
six
well
buttered
rolls
and
i
felt
my
strength
revive
i
looked
around
the
table
and
saw
my
compatriots
apparently
fresh
enough
while
the
jamaican
began
to
grow
red
in
the
face
and
seemed
uneasy
his
friend
said
nothing
but
seemed
so
overcome
that
i
saw
the
catastrophe
would
soon
happen
i
can
not
well
express
the
amazement
caused
by
this
denouement
and
from
the
burden
of
which
i
felt
myself
relieved
i
rang
the
bell
little
came
up
i
said
see
these
gentlemen
well
taken
care
of
we
drank
a
glass
to
their
health
at
last
the
waiter
came
and
bore
off
the
defeated
party
feet
foremost
wilkinson
friend
was
motionless
and
our
host
would
insist
on
singing
rule
britannia
footnote
the
translator
is
sorry
to
say
that
at
the
time
savarin
speaks
of
rule
britannia
was
not
written
the
new
york
papers
told
the
story
the
next
day
and
added
that
the
englishman
had
died
this
was
not
so
for
wilkinson
had
only
a
slight
attack
of
the
gout
iii
mystification
of
the
professor
and
defeat
of
a
general
several
years
ago
the
newspapers
told
us
of
the
discovery
of
a
new
perfume
called
the
emerocallis
a
bulbous
plant
which
has
an
odor
not
unlike
the
jasmin
i
am
very
curious
and
was
therefore
induced
in
all
probability
to
go
to
the
foubourg
germain
where
i
could
find
the
perfume
i
was
suitably
received
and
a
little
flask
very
well
wrapped
up
was
handed
me
which
seemed
to
contain
about
two
ounces
in
exchange
for
it
i
left
three
francs
an
etourdi
would
at
once
have
opened
smelled
and
tasted
it
a
professor
however
acts
differently
and
i
thought
modesty
would
become
me
i
took
the
flagon
then
and
went
quietly
home
sat
on
my
sofa
and
prepared
to
experience
a
new
sensation
i
took
the
package
from
my
pocket
and
untied
the
wrappings
which
surrounded
it
they
were
three
different
descriptions
of
the
emerocallis
and
referred
to
its
natural
history
its
flower
and
its
exquisite
perfume
either
in
the
shape
of
pastilles
in
the
kitchen
or
in
ices
i
read
each
of
the
wrappings
to
indemnify
myself
as
well
as
i
could
for
the
price
i
have
spoken
of
above
to
prepare
myself
for
an
appreciation
of
the
new
and
valuable
extract
i
have
spoken
of
i
then
opened
with
reverence
the
box
i
supposed
full
of
pastilles
to
my
surprise
however
i
found
three
other
copies
of
the
edition
i
had
so
carefully
read
inside
i
found
about
two
dozen
of
the
cubes
i
had
gone
so
far
for
i
tasted
them
and
must
say
that
i
found
them
very
agreeable
i
was
sorry
though
that
they
were
so
few
in
number
and
the
more
i
thought
of
the
matter
the
more
i
became
mystified
i
then
arose
with
the
intention
of
carrying
the
box
back
to
its
manufacturer
just
then
however
i
thought
of
my
grey
hairs
laughed
at
my
vivacity
and
sat
down
a
particular
circumstance
also
recurred
to
me
i
had
to
deal
with
a
druggist
and
only
four
days
ago
i
had
a
specimen
of
one
of
that
calling
i
had
one
day
to
visit
my
friend
bouvier
des
eclats
i
found
him
strolling
in
a
most
excited
state
up
and
down
the
room
and
crushing
in
his
hands
a
piece
of
poetry
i
thought
a
song
he
gave
it
to
me
and
said
look
at
this
you
know
all
about
it
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
an
apothecary
bill
i
was
not
consulted
as
a
poet
but
as
a
pharmaceutist
i
knew
what
the
trade
was
and
was
advising
him
to
be
quiet
when
the
door
opened
and
we
saw
a
man
of
about
enter
he
was
of
moderate
stature
and
his
whole
appearance
would
have
been
stern
had
there
not
been
something
sardonic
about
his
lips
he
approached
the
refused
to
sit
down
and
i
heard
the
following
dialogue
i
have
faithfully
recorded
monsieur
said
the
general
you
sent
me
a
regular
bill
the
man
in
black
said
that
he
was
not
an
apothecary
what
then
are
you
said
the
general
sir
i
am
a
pharmaceutist
well
said
the
general
your
boy
sir
i
have
no
boy
who
then
was
the
young
man
you
sent
thither
my
pupil
i
wish
to
say
sir
that
your
drugs
sir
i
do
not
sell
drugs
what
then
do
you
sell
remedies
the
general
at
once
became
ashamed
at
having
committed
so
many
solicisms
in
a
few
moments
and
paid
the
bill
iv
the
snare
the
chevalier
de
langeac
was
rich
but
his
fortune
was
dispensed
as
is
the
fortune
of
all
rich
men
he
funded
the
remnants
and
aided
by
a
little
pension
from
the
government
he
contrived
to
lead
a
very
pleasant
life
though
naturally
very
gallant
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
women
as
his
other
powers
passed
away
his
gourmandise
increased
he
became
a
professor
and
received
more
invitations
than
he
could
accept
lyons
is
a
pleasant
city
for
there
one
can
get
vin
de
bourdeaux
hermitage
and
burgundy
the
game
of
the
neighborhood
is
very
good
and
unexceptionable
fish
is
taken
from
the
lakes
in
the
vicinity
every
body
loves
bresse
chickens
langeac
was
therefore
welcome
at
all
the
best
tables
of
the
city
but
took
especial
delight
in
that
of
a
certain
a
in
the
winter
of
the
chevalier
received
a
letter
inviting
him
to
sup
ten
days
after
date
at
that
time
i
know
there
were
suppers
and
the
chevalier
quivered
with
emotion
at
the
idea
he
at
the
appointed
time
made
his
appearance
and
found
ten
guests
there
was
at
that
time
no
such
a
grand
dinner
was
soon
served
consisting
of
fish
flesh
and
fowl
all
was
very
good
but
the
chevalier
was
not
satisfied
with
the
hopes
he
had
entertained
another
thing
amazed
him
his
guests
did
not
seem
to
eat
the
chevalier
was
amazed
to
see
that
so
many
persons
had
been
collected
and
thinking
that
he
had
to
do
justice
to
all
these
fasting
people
set
to
work
at
once
the
second
service
was
solid
as
the
first
a
huge
turkey
was
dressed
plain
flavored
by
salads
and
macaroni
au
parmesan
when
he
saw
this
the
chevalier
felt
his
strength
revive
all
the
other
guests
were
overpowered
excited
by
the
changes
of
wines
he
triumphed
over
their
impotence
and
drank
their
health
again
and
again
every
time
he
drank
their
health
he
took
a
slice
from
the
turkey
due
attention
was
paid
to
the
and
the
chevalier
stuck
to
business
longer
than
any
one
would
have
thought
possible
he
only
revived
when
the
becfigues
appeared
and
became
fully
aroused
when
truffles
were
put
on
the
table
the
turbot
discord
one
day
sought
to
effect
an
entrance
into
one
of
the
most
harmonious
houses
of
paris
a
turbot
was
to
be
cooked
the
fish
was
on
the
next
day
to
be
served
to
a
company
of
which
i
was
one
it
was
fresh
fat
and
glorious
but
was
so
large
that
no
dish
in
the
house
could
hold
it
let
us
cut
it
in
half
said
the
husband
would
you
thus
dishonor
it
said
the
wife
we
must
my
dear
well
bring
the
knife
we
will
soon
do
it
wait
though
our
cousin
who
is
a
professor
will
soon
be
here
he
will
relieve
us
from
the
dilemma
the
gordian
knot
was
about
to
be
released
when
i
came
in
hungry
as
a
man
always
is
at
seven
when
i
came
in
i
tried
in
vain
to
make
the
usual
compliments
no
one
listened
and
for
that
reason
no
one
replied
to
me
the
subject
in
discussion
was
at
once
submitted
to
me
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
went
to
the
kitchen
found
a
kettle
large
enough
to
boil
the
whole
fish
and
did
so
there
was
a
procession
composed
of
the
master
mistress
servants
and
company
but
they
all
approved
of
what
i
did
with
the
fish
we
boiled
bulbous
root
and
other
vegetables
footnote
from
the
above
it
is
very
clear
that
brillat
savarin
made
what
the
late
webster
called
a
chowder
when
the
fish
was
cooked
we
sat
down
at
the
table
our
ideas
being
somewhat
sharpened
by
the
delay
and
sought
anxiously
for
the
time
of
which
homer
speaks
when
abundance
expells
hunger
the
translator
here
omits
a
very
excellent
recipe
for
a
everybody
knows
it
vi
pheasants
none
but
adepts
know
what
a
pheasant
is
they
only
can
appreciate
it
everything
has
its
apogee
of
excellence
some
of
which
like
capers
asparagus
partridges
are
eatable
only
when
they
are
young
others
are
edible
only
when
they
obtain
the
perfection
of
their
existence
such
as
melons
and
fruits
and
the
majority
of
the
beasts
which
furnish
us
with
animal
food
others
are
not
good
until
decomposition
begins
such
as
the
snipe
and
pheasant
when
the
pheasant
is
eaten
only
three
days
after
its
death
it
has
no
peculiarity
it
has
not
the
flavor
of
a
pullet
nor
the
perfume
of
a
quail
it
is
however
a
highly
flavored
dish
about
half
way
between
chicken
and
venison
it
is
especially
good
when
the
pheasant
begins
to
be
decomposed
an
aroma
and
exciting
oil
is
then
produced
like
coffee
only
produced
by
torrefaction
this
becomes
evident
by
a
slight
smell
and
change
of
color
persons
possessed
however
of
the
instincts
of
gourmandise
see
it
at
once
just
as
a
good
cook
knows
whether
he
should
take
his
bird
from
the
spit
or
give
it
a
turn
or
two
more
when
the
pheasant
is
in
that
condition
it
should
he
plucked
and
not
before
the
bird
should
then
he
stuffed
and
in
the
following
manner
take
two
snipe
and
draw
them
so
as
to
put
the
birds
on
one
plate
and
the
livers
on
another
take
the
flesh
and
mingle
it
with
beef
lard
and
herbes
fines
adding
also
salt
and
truffles
enough
to
fill
the

and
cover
it
with

liver
and
a

truffles
an

and
a

put
the

on
this
preparation

when
it
is
boiled
surround
it
with

not

uneasy
about
your
dinner
drink
burgundy
after
this
dish
for
long
experience
has
taught
me
that
it
is
the
proper
wine
a
pheasant
served
in
this
way
is
a
fit
dish
for
angels
if
they
visited
the
world
as
they
did
in
lot
day
what
i
say
experience
has
already
proved
a
pheasant
thus
stuffed
by
picard
at
la
grange
footnote

he
refer
to
la
estate
was
brought
on
the
table
by
the
cook
himself
it
was
looked
on
by
the
ladies
as
they
would
have
looked
at
one
of
mary
herbault
hats
it
was
scientifically
tasted
and
in
the
interim
the
ladies
eyes
shone
like
stars
and
their
lips
became
coral
i
did
more
than
this
i
gave
a
similar
proof
to
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
they
are
aware
that
the
toga
is
sometimes
to
be
laid
aside
and
i
was
able
to
show
to
several
that
good
cheer
was
a
fit
companion
and
reward
for
the
labors
of
the
senate
after
a
few
moments
the
oldest
judge
uttered
the
word
excellent
all
bowed
and
the
court
adopted
the
decision
i
had
observed
that
the
venerable
old
men
seemed
to
take
great
delight
in
smelling
the
dish
and
that
their
august
brows
were
agitated
by
expressions
of
extreme
serenity
something
like
a
half
smile
hanging
on
their
lips
all
this
thing
however
is
naturally
accounted
for
the
pheasant
itself
a
very
good
bird
had
imbibed
the
dressing
and
the
flavor
of
the
truffle
and
snipe
it
thus
becomes
thrice
better
thus
of
all
the
good
things
collected
every
atom
is
appreciated
and
the
consequence
is
i
think
the
pheasant
fit
for
the
table
of
a
prince

iii
in
a
chapter
written
for
the
purpose
the
advantages
france
derived
from
gourmandise
in
were
fully
explained
this
was
not
less
useful
to
emigres
all
those
who
had
any
alimentary
resources
received
much
benefit
from
it
when
i
passed
through
boston
i
taught
a
cook
named
julien
who
in
was
in
his
glory
how
to
serve
eggs
with
cheese
julien
was
a
skilful
lad
and
had
he
said
been
employed
by
the
archbishop
of
bourdeaux
this
was
to
the
americans
a
new
dish
and
julien
in
return
sent
me
a
beautiful
deer
he
had
received
from
canada
which
those
i
invited
to
do
honour
to
it
thought
admirable
captain
collet
also
in
and
earned
much
money
by
the
manufacture
of
ices
and
sherbets
women
always
take
care
to
enjoy
any
pleasures
which
are
new
to
them
none
can
form
an
idea
of
their
surprise
they
could
not
understand
how
it
could
remain
so
cold
when
the
thermometer
was
at
degrees
reaumur
when
i
was
at
cologne
i
found
a
breton
nobleman
who
thought
himself
very
fortunate
as
the
keeper
of
a
public
house
and
i
might
multiply
these
examples
indefinitely
i
prefer
however
to
tell
of
a
frenchman
who
became
very
rich
at
london
from
the
skill
he
displayed
in
making
salad
he
was
a
limousin
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
was
named
aubignac
or
albignac
poor
as
he
was
he
went
however
one
day
to
dine
at
one
of
the
first
restaurants
of
london
he
could
always
make
a
good
dinner
on
a
single
good
dish
while
he
was
discussing
a
piece
of
roast
beef
five
or
six
dandies
sat
at
the
next
table
and
one
of
them
advanced
and
said
sir
they
say
your
people
excel
in
the
art
of
making
a
salad
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
oblige
us
after
some
hesitation
consented
and
having
set
seriously
to
work
did
his
best
while
he
was
making
his
mixture
he
replied
frankly
to
questions
about
his
condition
and
my
friend
owned
not
without
a
little
blushing
that
he
received
the
aid
of
the
english
government
a
circumstance
which
doubtless
induced
one
of
the
young
men
to
slip
a
ten
pound
bank
bill
into
his
hand
he
gave
them
his
address
and
not
long
after
was
much
surprised
to
receive
a
letter
inviting
him
to
come
to
dress
a
salad
at
one
of
the
best
houses
in
grosvenor
square
began
to
see
that
he
might
draw
considerable
benefit
from
it
and
did
not
hesitate
to
accept
the
offer
he
took
with
him
various
preparations
which
he
fancied
would
make
his
salad
perfect
as
possible
he
took
more
pains
in
this
second
effort
and
succeeded
better
than
he
had
at
first
on
this
occasion
so
large
a
sum
was
handed
to
him
that
he
could
not
with
justice
to
himself
refuse
to
accept
it
the
young
men
he
met
first
had
exaggerated
the
salad
he
had
prepared
for
them
and
the
second
entertainment
was
yet
louder
in
its
praise
he
became
famous
as
the
fashionable
and
those
who
knew
anything
of
satirical
poetry
remembered
desir
do
nonne
est
un
feu
pui
devore
desir
est
cent
fois
piri
encore
like
a
man
of
sense
took
advantage
of
the
excitement
and
soon
obtained
a
carriage
that
he
might
travel
more
rapidly
from
one
part
of
the
town
to
the
other
he
had
in
a
mahogany
case
all
the
ingredients
he
required
subsequently
he
had
similar
cases
prepared
and
filled
which
he
used
to
sell
by
the
hundred
ultimately
he
made
a
fortune
of
francs
which
he
took
to
france
when
times
became
more
peaceful
when
he
had
returned
to
france
he
did
not
hurry
to
paris
but
with
laudable
precaution
placed
francs
in
the
funds
and
with
the
rest
purchased
a
little
estate
on
which
for
aught
i
know
he
now
lives
happily
his
funded
money
paid
him
fifty
per
cent
these
facts
were
imparted
to
me
by
a
friend
who
had
known

in
london
and
who
had
met
him
after
his
return
viii
recollections
of
the
emigration
the
weaver
in
de
rostaing
my
cousin
and
friend
now
military
intendant
at
lyons
a
man
of
great
talent
and
ability
and
myself
were
in
switzerland
we
went
to
mondon
where
i
had
many
relations
and
was
kindly
received
by
the
family
of
troillet
i
will
never
forget
their
hospitality
i
was
there
shown
a
young
french
officer
who
was
a
weaver
and
who
became
one
thus
this
young
man
a
member
of
a
very
good
family
was
passing
through
mondon
to
join
condes
army
and
chanced
to
meet
an
old
man
with
one
of
the
animated
heads
usually
attributed
by
painters
to
the
companions
of
the
famous
tell
at
their
dessert
the
officer
did
not
conceal
his
situation
and
received
much
sympathy
from
his
new
friend
the
latter
complained
that
at
such
an
age
he
had
now
to
renounce
all
that
was
pleasant
and
that
every
man
should
as
jean
jacques
says
have
some
trade
to
support
themselves
in
adversity
the
conversation
paused
there
and
a
short
time
after
he
joined
the
army
of
conde
from
what
he
saw
there
however
he
saw
he
never
could
expect
to
enter
france
in
that
way
then
he
remembered
the
words
of
the
weaver
and
finally
making
up
his
mind
left
the
army
returned
to
mondon
and
begged
the
weaver
to
receive
him
as
an
apprentice
on
the
next
day
the
officer
set
to
work
dining
and
sleeping
with
the
weaver
and
was
so
assiduous
that
after
six
months
his
master
told
him
he
had
nothing
to
teach
him
thought
himself
repaid
for
the
care
he
had
bestowed
and
that
all
he
earned
henceforth
was
his
own
profit
when
i
was
at
mondon
the
new
artisan
had
earned
money
enough
to
purchase
a
shop
and
a
bed
he
worked
with
great
assiduity
and
such
interest
was
taken
in
him
that
some
of
the
first
houses
of
the
city
enquired
after
him
every
day
on
sunday
he
wore
his
uniform
and
resumed
his
social
rights
as
he
was
very
well
read
all
took
pleasure
in
his
company
and
he
did
not
seem
discontented
with
his
fate
the
starving
to
this
picture
of
the
advantage
of
industry
i
am
about
to
add
an
altogether
different
one
i
met
at
lausanne
an
emigre
from
lyons
who
to
avoid
work
used
to
eat
but
twice
a
week
he
would
have
died
beyond
a
doubt
if
a
merchant
in
the
city
had
not
promised
to
pay
for
his
dinner
every
sunday
and
wednesday
of
the
week
the
emigre
came
always
at
the
appointed
time
and
always
took
away
a
large
piece
of
bread
he
had
been
living
in
this
manner
some
three
months
when
i
met
him
he
had
not
been
sick
but
he
was
so
pale
that
it
was
sad
to
see
him
i
was
amazed
that
he
would
suffer
such
pain
rather
than
work
i
asked
him
once
to
dine
with
me
but
did
not
repeat
the
invitation
because
i
believe
in
obeying
that
divine
precept
by
the
sweat
of
thy
brow
shalt
thou
earn
thy
bread
sojourn
in
america
from
switzerland
i
went
to
america
asparagus
passing
one
day
in
february
by
the
palais
royal
i
paused
before
the
shop
of
mme
chevet
the
largest
dealer
in
comestibles
in
paris
who
always
wished
me
well
seeing
a
large
box
of
asparagus
the
smallest
of
which
was
large
as
my
finger
i
asked
the
price
forty
francs
said
she
they
are
very
fine
but
only
a
king
or
prince
could
eat
at
such
a
rate
you
are
wrong
sir
said
she
such
things
never
go
to
palaces
but
i
will
sell
the
asparagus
there
are
now
in
this
city
at
least
three
hundred
rich
men
capitalists
and
financiers
retained
at
home
by
gout
colds
and
doctors
they
are
always
busy
to
ascertain
what
will
revive
them
and
send
their
valets
out
on
voyages
of
discovery
some
one
of
them
will
remark
this
asparagus
and
it
will
be
bought
it
may
be
some
pretty
woman
will
pass
with
her
lover
and
say
fine
asparagus
how
well
my
servant
dresses
it
the
lover
then
does
not
hesitate
and
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
that
dear
things
are
sold
more
easily
than
cheap
ones
as
she
spoke
two
fat
englishmen
passed
us
they
seemed
struck
at
once
one
seized
hold
of
the
asparagus
and
without
asking
the
price
paid
for
it
and
as
he
walked
away
whistled
god
save
the
king
monsieur
said
madame
chevet
a
thousand
things
like
this
happen
every
day
fondue
fondue
is
a
soup
dish
and
consists
only
in
frying
eggs
in
cheese
in
proportions
revealed
by
experience
i
will
give
the
recipe
it
is
a
pleasant
dish
quickly
made
and
easily
prepared
for
unexpected
guests
i
refer
to
it
here
only
for
my
peculiar
pleasure
and
because
it
preserves
the
memory
of
things
which
the
old
men
of
belley
recollect
towards
the
end
of
the
century
madot
became
bishop
of
belley
and
took
possession
of
the
diocese
those
to
whom
his
reception
had
been
confided
had
provided
an
entertainment
worthy
of
the
occasion
and
made
use
of
all
the
preparations
then
known
in
the
kitchen
to
welcome
my
lord
there
was
an
immense
fondue
to
which
the
prelate
paid
great
attention
to
the
surprise
of
all
he
ate
it
with
a
spoon
instead
of
a
fork
as
people
had
been
used
to
do
all
the
guests
looked
at
each
other
with
a
perceptible
smile
on
every
face
a
bishop
from
paris
however
must
know
how
to
eat
on
the
next
day
there
was
a
great
deal
of
gossip
and
people
that
met
at
the
corners
said
well
did
you
see
how
our
bishop
ate
his
fondue
i
heard
from
a
person
who
was
present
that
he
used
a
spoon
the
bishop
had
some
followers
innovators
who
preferred
the
spoon
but
the
majority
preferred
the
fork
and
an
old
of
mine
used
to
laugh
as
if
he
would
die
as
he
told
how
de
madot
ate
fondue
with
a
spoon
recipe
for
fondue
copied
from

papers
of

disappointment
all
one
day
was
quiet
at
the
ecu
de
france
between
bourg
and
bresse
when
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
and
a
superb
english
berline
drove
up
on
the
box
of
which
were
two
pretty
abigails
wrapped
in
blue
and
red
cloths
at
the
sight
which
announced
a
nobleman
on
his
travels
chicot
that
was
his
name
hurried
to
the
door
of
the
equipage
the
wife
stood
at
the
door
the
girls
near
by
while
the
boys
from
the
stable
hurried
forward
satisfied
that
they
would
receive
a
handsome
gratuity
the
women
were
unpacked
and
there
came
from
the
berline
a
fat
englishman
two
thin
pale
girls
and
a
lady
apparently
in
the
first
stage
of
consumption
the
last
spoke
landlord
said
she
take
care
of
the
horses
give
us
a
room
and
the
women
refreshments
all
must
cost
only
six
francs
act
accordingly
chicot
put
on
his
bonnet
madame
went
into
the
house
and
the
girls
to
their
garrets
the
horses
were
however
put
into
the
stable
the
englishman
read
the
papers
and
the
women
had
a
pitcher
of
pure
water
the
ladies
went
up
stairs
the
six
francs
were
received
as
a
poor
compensation
for
the
trouble
caused
wonderful
effects
of
a
classical
dinner
alas
how
much
i
am
to
be
pitied
said
the
elegiac
voice
of
a
gastronomer
of
the
royal
court
of
the
seine
hoping
to
be
soon
able
to
return
home
i
left
my
cook
there
business
detains
me
at
paris
and
i
have
to
depend
on
an
old
women
the
preparations
of
whom
make
me
sick
anything
satisfies
my
wife
and
children
but
i
am
made
a
martyr
of
the
spit
and
pot
luckily
a
friend
heard
the
complaint
who
said
you
will
not
my
friend
be
a
martyr
deign
to
accept
a
classical
dinner
and
after
a
game
of
piquet
we
will
bury
all
in
the
abyss
of
the
past
the
invitation
was
accepted
the
mystery
was
solved
and
since
the
june
the
professor
has
been
delighted
at
having
one
of
his
best
friends
in
royal
court
effect
and
danger
of
strong
drinks
the
artificial
thirst
we
previously
alluded
to
is
that
which
for
the
moment
appeals
to
strong
drinks
as
a
momentary
relief
it
gradually
becomes
so
habitual
that
those
who
grow
used
to
it
can
not
do
without
it
even
through
the
night
and
have
to
leave
their
bed
to
appease
it
this
thirst
then
becomes
a
real
disease
and
when
he
has
reached
that
point
it
may
safely
be
said
that
he
has
not
two
years
to
live
i
travelled
in
holland
with
a
rich
dantzick
merchant
who
had
for
fifty
years
kept
the
principal
house
for
the
sale
of
brandy
monsieur
said
he
none
in
france
are
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
trade
in
brandy
which
for
nearly
a
century
my
father
and
myself
have
carried
on
i
have
watched
with
attention
the
workmen
who
yield
to
it
as
too
many
germans
do
and
they
generally
die
in
the
same
manner
at
first
they
take
simply
a
glass
in
the
morning
and
for
many
years
this
suffices
it
is
a
common
habit
with
all
workmen
and
any
one
who
did
not
indulge
in
it
would
be
ridiculed
by
his
companions
then
they
double
the
dose
that
is
to
say
take
a
glass
at
morning
and
night
thus
things
continue
about
three
years
when
they
begin
to
drink
three
times
a
day
and
will
only
taste
spirits
in
which
highly
scented
herbs
have
been
infused
having
reached
that
point
one
may
be
sure
they
have
not
more
than
six
months
to
live
for
they
go
to
the
hospital
and
are
seen
no
more
chevaliers
and
abbes
i
have
already
referred
to
these
categories
of
gourmandise
destroyed
by
time
as
they
disappeared
thirty
years
since
few
of
the
present
generation
ever
saw
them
about
the
end
of
the
century
they
will
probably
reappear
but
as
such
a
phenomenon
demand
the
coincidence
of
many
future
contingencies
i
think
few
who
live
will
ever
witness
this
palingenesia
as
a
painter
of
manners
i
must
give
the
last
touch
to
my
portrait
and
will
borrow
the
following
passage
from
an
author
who
i
know
will
refuse
me
nothing
the
title
of
chevalier
was
only
correctly
granted
to
persons
who
had
been
decorated
or
to
the
younger
sons
of
noble
houses
many
of
the
chevaliers
of
other
families
would
take
the
title
for
themselves
and
if
they
had
education
and
good
manners
none
doubted
the
accolade
they
were
generally
young
wore
the
sword
vertically
and
kept
a
stiff
upper
lip
they
gamed
and
fought
and
were
a
portion
of
the
train
of
any
fashionable
beauty
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
many
of
the
chevaliers
joined
the
army
of
the
emigres
enlisted
or
dispersed
the
few
who
survive
can
yet
be
recognized
by
their
military
air
almost
all
of
them
however
have
the
gout
when
any
noble
family
had
many
children
one
was
dedicated
to
the
church
at
first
some
benefice
barely
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
expenses
of
education
was
obtained
and
ultimately
he
became
prince
abbe
or
bishop
as
circumstances
dictated
this
was
the
real
abbe
but
many
young
men
who
disliked
the
perils
of
the
chevalier
called
themselves
abbes
when
they
came
to
paris
nothing
was
so
convenient
for
with
a
slight
change
of
dress
they
could
appear
as
priests
and
the
equals
of
anybody
there
was
a
great
advantage
in
this
for
every
house
had
its
abbe
they
were
generally
small
round
well
dressed
and
agreeable
they
were
gourmands
active
and
pleasant
the
few
that
remain
have
became
very
devout
and
very
fat
none
could
be
more
comfortable
than
a
rich
prior
or
abbot
they
had
no
superiors
and
nothing
to
do
if
there
be
a
long
peace
the
priors
will
turn
up
again
but
unless
there
be
a
great
change
in
the
ecclesiastical
organization
the
abbes
are
lost
for
ever
wine
monsieur
said
an
old
marquise
to
me
one
day
which
do
you
like
best
burgundy
or
bordeaux
madame
said
i
i
have
such
a
passion
for
examining
into
the
matter
that
i
always
postpone
the
decision
a
week
strawberries
the
count
de
la
place
recommends
that
strawberries
should
always
be
dressed
with
orange
juice
judgment
he
is
not
a
man
of
mind
said
the
count
de

why
ah
he
does
not
eat
pudding
a
la
richelieu
nor
cutlets
a
la
soubise
raisins
take
a
raisin
no
i
thank
you
i
do
not
like
wine
in
pills
a
day
with
the
bernardines
it
was
about
one
on
a
fine
summer
night
and
i
set
out
after
having
been
serenaded
by
many
who
took
an
interest
in
us
this
was
about
i
then
was
the
chief
of
a
troop
of
amateur
musicians
all
of
whom
were
young
and
healthy
monsieur
said
the
abbe
of
saint
sulpice
to
me
one
day
and
he
drew
me
into
a
window
recess
you
would
enjoy
yourself
very
much
if
you
come
some
day
to
play
for
us
at
saint
bernard
the
saints
would
be
delighted
i
accepted
the
offer
at
once
for
it
seemed
to
promise
us
an
agreeable
evening
i
nodded
assent
and
all
were
amazed
annuit
et
totum
nutu
tremefecit
olympum
every
precaution
had
previously
been
taken
for
we
had
yet
to
go
four
leagues
a
distance
sufficient
to
terrify
the
persons
who
had
ascended
mont
martre
the
monastery
was
in
a
valley
enclosed
on
the
west
side
by
a
mountain
and
on
the
east
by
a
hill
that
was
not
so
high
the
eastern
peak
was
crowned
by
a
forest
of
immense
pines
the
valley
was
one
vast
prairie
and
the
beech
grows
much
like
the
arrangements
of
an
english
garden
we
came
about
evenfall
and
were
received
by
the
cellarer
who
had
a
nose
very
an
obelisk
gentlemen
said
he
our
abbe
will
be
glad
when
he
hears
you
have
come
he
is
yet
in
bed
but
come
with
me
and
you
will
see
whether
we
have
expected
you
or
not
we
followed
him
and
besought
him
to
take
us
to
the
refectory
amid
the
display
of
the
table
arose
a
pate
like
a
cathedral
on
one
side
was
a
quarter
of
cold
veal
artichokes
were
also
on
the
eastern
range
there
were
various
kinds
of
fruits
napkins
knives
and
plate
at
the
foot
of
the
table
were
many
attentive
servants
at
one
corner
of
the
refrectory
was
seen
more
than
an
hundred
bottles
kept
cool
by
a
natural
fountain
we
could
snuff
the
aroma
of
mocha
though
in
those
venerable
days
none
ever
drank
mocha
so
early
in
the
morning
the
reverend
cellarer
for
a
time
laughed
at
our
emotion
and
then
spoke
to
us
as
follows
gentlemen
said
he
i
would
be
pleased
to
keep
you
company
but
as
yet
i
have
not
kept
my
mass
i
ought
to
ask
you
to
drink
but
the
mountain
air
dispenses
the
necessity
receive
then
what
we
offer
you
i
must
to
matins
he
went
to
matins
we
did
our
best
to
eat
up
the
abbe
dinner
but
could
not
people
from
sirius
might
but
it
was
too
much
for
us
after
dinner
we
dispersed
i
crept
into
a
good
bed
until
mass
like
the
heroes
of
rocroy
who
slept
until
the
battle
began
i
was
aroused
by
a
great
fat
friar
who
had
nearly
pulled
my
arm
out
of
its
socket
and
went
to
the
church
where
i
found
all
at
their
posts
we
played
a
symphony
at
the
offertory
and
sung
a
motet
at
the
elevation
concluding
with
four
wind
instruments
we
contrived
in
spite
of
the
jests
usually
expended
on
amateurs
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
very
well
we
received
with
great
benignity
the
praises
heaped
on
us
and
having
received
the
abbot
thanks
went
to
the
table
the
dinner
was
such
as
people
used
to
eat
in
the
fifteenth
century
there
were
few
superfluities
but
the
choice
of
dishes
was
admirable
we
had
plain
honest
substantial
stews
good
meats
and
dishes
of
vegetables
which
made
one
regret
they
were
not
more
general
the
dessert
was
the
more
remarkable
as
it
was
composed
of
fruits
not
produced
at
that
altitude
the
gardens
of
machuras
of
morflent
and
other
places
had
contributed
there
was
no
want
of
liqueurs
but
coffee
needs
a
particular
reference
it
was
clear
perfumed
and
strong
but
was
not
served
in
what
are
called
tasses
on
the
seine
but
in
huge
bowls
into
which
the
monks
dipped
their
lips
and
smacked
them
with
delight
after
dinner
we
went
to
vespers
and
between
the
psalms
executed
antiphones
i
prepared
for
the
purpose
that
style
of
music
was
then
fashionable
i
can
not
say
if
mine
was
good
or
bad
our
day
being
over
my
orchestra
was
enabled
to
look
and
walk
around
on
my
return
the
abbe
said
i
am
about
to
leave
you
and
will
suffer
you
to
finish
the
night
i
do
not
think
my
presence
at
all
importunate
to
the
fathers
but
i
wish
them
to
do
as
they
please
when
the
abbot
had
left
the
monks
drew
more
closely
together
and
a
thousand
jokes
were
told
not
the
less
funny
because
the
world
knows
nothing
of
them
about
nine
a
glorious
supper
was
served
long
in
advance
of
the
dinner
they
laughed
sang
told
stories
and
one
of
the
fathers
recited
some
very
good
verses
he
had
himself
composed
at
last
a
monk
arose
and
said
father
cellarer
what
have
you
to
say
true
said
the
father
i
am
not
cellarer
for
nothing
he
left
and
soon
returned
with
three
servitors
the
first
of
whom
brought
some
glorious
fresh
buttered
toast
the
others
had
a
table
on
which
was
a
sweetened
preparation
of
brandy
and
water
vulgo
punch
the
new
comers
were
received
with
acclamation
the
company
ate
the
toasts
drank
the
toddy
and
when
the
abbey
clock
struck
twelve
all
went
to
their
cells
to
enjoy
a
repose
they
had
richly
earned
prosperity
en
route
one
day
i
rode
a
horse
i
called
la
joie
through
the
it
was
at
the
worst
era
of
the
revolution
and
i
went
to
see
prot
to
obtain
a
passport
which
probably
might
save
me
from
prison
or
the
scaffold
at
about
i
reached
a
little
bourg
or
village
called
mont
vaudrey
and
having
first
attended
to
my
horse
was
struck
by
a
spectacle
no
traveller
ever
saw
without
delight
before
a
fire
was
a
spit
covered
with
cock
quails
and
the
rails
that
are
always
so
fat
all
the
juice
from
the
quails
fell
on
an
immense
rotie
so
built
up
that
the
huntsman
hand
was
apparent
then
came
one
of
those
leverets
the
perfume
of
which
parisians
have
no
faith
in
though
they
fill
the
room
ah
ha
said
i
providence
has
not
entirely
deserted
me
let
us
scent
this
perfume
and
die
afterwards
speaking
to
the
landlord
who
while
i
was
making
my
examinations
walked
up
and
down
the
room
i
said
mon
cher
what
can
you
give
us
for
dinner
nothing
very
good
monsieur
you
can
have
potatoes
the
beans
are
awful
i
never
had
a
worse
dinner
the
landlord
seemed
to
suspect
the
cause
of
my
disappointment
i
said
however
for
whom
is
all
this
game
kept
alas
monsieur
said
he
it
is
not
mine
but
belongs
to
some
lawyers
and
judges
who
have
been
here
several
days
on
a
business
which
concerns
a
very
rich
old
lady
they
finished
yesterday
and
wish
to
celebrate
the
event
by
a
revolt
monsieur
said
i
be
pleased
to
say
that
a
gentleman
asks
the
favor
of
being
permitted
to
dine
with
them
that
he
will
pay
his
portion
of
the
expense
and
also
be
much
obliged
to
them
he
left
me
and
did
not
return
but
after
a
few
minutes
a
little
fat
man
entered
who
hovered
around
the
kitchen
lifted
up
the
covers
and
disappeared
ah
ha
said
i
the
tiler
has
come
to
look
at
me
i
began
to
hope
for
i
knew
my
appearance
was
not
repulsive
my
heart
beat
quickly
as
a
candidate
does
after
the
is
opened
and
before
he
knows
the
result
when
the
landlord
told
me
the
gentlemen
only
waited
for
me
to
sit
down
i
went
at
once
and
was
received
in
the
most
flattering
manner
the
dinner
was
glorious
i
will
not
describe
it
but
only
refer
to
an
admirable
fricassee
of
chicken
not
often
seen
in
such
perfection
in
the
country
it
had
so
many
truffles
that
it
would
have
revived
an
old
titan
we
sang
danced
and
passed
the
evening
pleasantly
the
translator
here
omits
half
a
dozen
songs
which
are
essentially
french
and
which
no
one
can
do
justice
to
in
another
tongue
de
p
i
believe
i
am
the
first
person
who
ever
conceived
the
idea
of
a
gastronomical
academy
i
am
afraid
however
i
was
a
little
in
advance
of
the
day
as
people
may
judge
by
what
took
place
fifteen
years
afterwards
the
president
de
the
ideas
of
whom
braved
every
age
and
era
speaking
to
three
of
the
most
enlightened
men
of
his
age
laplace
chaptal
and
berthollet
said
i
look
in
the
history
of
the
discovery
of
a
new
dish
which
prolongs
our
pleasures
as
far
more
important
than
the
discovery
of
a
new
star
i
shall
never
think
science
sufficiently
honored
until
i
see
a
cook
in
the
first
class
of
the
institute
the
good
old
president
was
always
delighted
when
he
thought
of
his
labor
he
always
wished
to
furnish
me
an
epigraph
not
like
that
which
made
montesquieu
a
member
of
the
academy
i
therefore
wrote
several
verses
about
it
but
to
be
copied

my

yet
i
am
not

i

is

those
who

will
