the

the
piece
was
a
west
end
success
so
brilliant
that
even
if
you
belonged
to
the
intellectual
despisers
of
the
british
theatre
you
could
not
hold
up
your
head
in
the
world
unless
you
had
seen
it
even
for
such
as
you
it
was
undeniably
a
success
of
curiosity
at
least
the
stage
scene
flamed
extravagantly
with
crude
orange
and
viridian
light
a
rectangle
of
bedazzling
illumination
on
the
boards
in
the
midst
of
great
width
with
great
depth
behind
them
and
arching
height
above
tiny
squeaking
figures
ogled
the
primeval
passion
in
gesture
and
innuendo
from
the
arc
of
the
upper
circle
convergent
beams
of
light
pierced
through
gloom
and
broke
violently
on
this
group
of
the
lovely
and
the
swathed
grotesque
the
group
did
not
quail
in
fullest
publicity
it
was
licensed
to
say
that
which
in
private
could
not
be
said
where
men
and
women
meet
and
that
which
could
not
be
printed
it
gave
a
voice
to
the
silent
appeal
of
pictures
and
posters
and
illustrated
weeklies
all
over
the
town
it
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
most
secret
groves
in
the
vast
undiscovered
hearts
of
men
and
women
young
and
old
the
lovely
were
protected
from
the
satyrs
in
the
audience
by
an
impalpable
screen
made
of
light
and
of
ascending
music
in
which
strings
brass
and
concussion
exemplified
the
naïve
sensuality
of
lyrical
niggers
the
guffaw
which
occasionally
leaping
sharply
out
of
the
dim
mysterious
auditorium
surged
round
the
silhouetted
conductor
and
drove
like
a
cyclone
between
the
barriers
of
plush
and
gilt
and
fat
cupids
on
to
the
stage
this
huge
guffaw
seemed
to
indicate
what
might
have
happened
if
the
magic
protection
of
the
impalpable
screen
had
not
been
there
behind
the
audience
came
the
restless
promenade
where
was
the
reality
which
the
stage
reflected
there
it
was
multitudinous
obtainable
seizable
dumbly
imploring
to
be
carried
off
the
stage
very
daring
yet
dared
no
more
than
hint
at
the
existence
of
the
bright
and
joyous
reality
but
there
it
was
under
the
same
roof
christine
entered
with
madame
larivaudière
between
shoulders
and
broad
hats
as
through
a
telescope
she
glimpsed
in
the
far
distance
the
illusive
glowing
oblong
of
the
stage
then
the
silhouetted
conductor
and
the
tops
of
instruments
then
the
dark
curved
concentric
rows
of
spectators
lastly
she
took
in
the
promenade
in
which
she
stood
she
surveyed
the
promenade
with
a
professional
eye
it
instantly
shocked
her
not
as
it
might
have
shocked
one
ignorant
of
human
nature
and
history
but
by
reason
of
its
frigidity
its
constraint
its
solemnity
its
pretence
in
one
glance
she
embraced
all
the
figures
moving
or
stationary
against
the
hedge
of
shoulders
in
front
and
against
the
mirrors
behind
all
of
them
the

as
well
as
the
vivid

and
their
clientèle
in
black
tweed
or
khaki
with
scarcely
an
exception
they
all
had
the
same
strange
look
the
same
absence
of
gesture
they
were
northern
blond
terribly
impassive
christine
impulsively
exclaimed
and
the
faint
cry
was
dragged
out
of
her
out
of
the
bottom
of
her
heart
by
what
she
saw
my
god
how
mournful
it
is

larivaudière
a
stout
and
benevolent
bruxelloise
agreed
with
uncomprehending
indulgence
the
two
chatted
together
for
a
few
moments
each
ceremoniously
addressing
the
other
as
madame

then
they

measureless
as
the
future
and
the
past
surrounded
her
with
the
unknown
but
she
had
not
been
afraid
because
of
her
conviction
that
men
were
much
the
same
everywhere
and
that
she
had
power
over
them
she
did
not
exercise
this
power
consciously
she
had
merely
to
exist
and
it
exercised
itself
for
her
this
power
was
the
mystical
central
fact
of
the
universe
now
however
as
she
stood
in
the
promenade
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
uncanny
had
happened
to
the
universe
surely
it
had
shifted
from
its
pivot
her
basic
conviction
trembled
men
were
not
the
same
everywhere
and
her
power
over
them
was
a
delusion
englishmen
were
incomprehensible
they
were
not
human
they
were
apart
the
memory
of
the
hundreds
of
englishmen
who
had
yielded
to
her
power
in
paris
for
she
had
specialised
in
travelling
englishmen
could
not
her
conviction
as
to
the
sameness
of
men
the
presence
of
her
professed
rivals
of
various
nationalities
in
the
promenade
could
not
restore
it
either
the
promenade
in
its
cold
prim
languor
was
the
very
negation
of
desire
she
was
afraid
she
foresaw
ruin
for
herself
in
this
london
inclement
misty
and
inscrutable
and
then
she
noticed
a
man
looking
at
her
and
she
was
herself
again
and
the
universe
was
itself
again
she
had
a
sensation
of
warmth
and
heavenly
reassurance
just
as
though
she
had
drunk
an
anisette
or
a
crême
de
menthe
her
features
took
on
an
innocent
expression
the
characteristic
puckering
of
the
brows
denoted
not
discontent
but
a
gentle
concern
for
the
whole
world
and
also
virginal
curiosity
the
man
passed
her
she
did
not
stir
presently
he
emerged
afresh
out
of
the
moving
knots
of
promenaders
and
discreetly
approached
her
she
did
not
smile
but
her
eyes
lighted
with
a
faint
amiable
benevolence
scarcely
perceptible
doubtful
deniable
even
but
enough
the
man
stopped
she
at
once
gave
a
frank
kind
smile
which
changed
all
her
face
he
raised
his
hat
an
inch
or
so
she
liked
men
to
raise
their
hats
clearly
he
was
a
gentleman
of
means
though
in
morning
dress
his
cigar
had
a
very
fine
aroma
she
classed
him
in
half
a
second
and
was
happy
he
spoke
to
her
in
french
with
a
slight
unmistakable
english
accent
but
very
good
easy
conversational
french
french
french
she
responded
almost
ecstatically
ah
you
speak
french
she
was
too
excited
to
play
the
usual
comedy
so
flattering
to
most
englishmen
of
pretending
that
she
thought
from
his
speech
that
he
was
a
frenchman
the
french
so
well
spoken
from
a
man
mouth
in
london
most
marvellously
enheartened
her
and
encouraged
her
in
the
perilous
enterprise
of
her
career
she
was
candidly
grateful
to
him
for
speaking
french
he
said
after
a
moment
you
have
not
at
all
a
fatigued
air
but
would
it
not
be
preferable
to
sit
down
a
man
of
the
world
he
could
phrase
his
politeness
ah
there
were
none
like
an
englishman
of
the
world
frenchmen
delightfully
courteous
up
to
a
point
were
unsatisfactory
past
that
point
frenchmen
of
the
south
were
detestable
and
she
hated
them
you
have
not
been
in
london
long
said
the
man
leading
her
away
to
the
lounge
she
observed
then
that
despite
his
national
phlegm
he
was
in
a
state
of
rather
intense
excitation
luck
enormous
luck
and
also
an
augury
for
the
future
she
was
professing
in
london
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
not
been
in
the
promenade
for
five
minutes
and
lo
the
ideal
admirer
for
he
was
not
young
what
a
fine
omen
for
her
profound
mysticism
and
superstitiousness
chapter
the
flat
her
flat
was
in
cork
street
as
soon
as
they
entered
it
the
man
remarked
on
its
warmth
and
its
cosiness
so
agreeable
after
the
november
streets
christine
only
smiled
it
was
a
long
narrow
flat
a
small
with
a
piano
and
a
sideboard
opening
into
a
larger
bedroom
shaped
like
a
thick
the
short
top
of
the
l
not
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
room
was
installed
as
a
de
but
it
had
a
divan
from
the
divan
behind
which
was
a
heavily
curtained
window
you
could
see
right
through
the
flat
to
the
curtained
window
of
the
all
the
lights
were
softened
by
paper
shades
of
a
peculiar
hot
tint
between
indian
red
and
carmine
giving
a
rich
romantic
effect
to
the
gleaming
pale
enamelled
furniture
and
to
the
voluptuous
engravings
after
sir
frederick
leighton
and
the
sweet
sentimental
engravings
after
marcus
stone
and
to
the
assorted
knicknacks
the
flat
had
homogeneity
for
everything
in
it
except
the
stove
had
been
bought
at
one
shop
in
tottenham
court
road
by
a
landlord
who
knew
his
business
the
stove
which
was
large
stood
in
the
bedroom
fireplace
and
thence
radiated
celestial
comfort
and
security
throughout
the
home
the
stove
was
the
divinity
of
the
home
and
christine
the
priestess
she
had
herself
bought
the
stove
and
she
understood
its
personality
it
was
one
of
your
finite
gods
will
you
take
something
she
asked
the
hostess
whisky
and
a
siphon
and
glasses
were
on
the
sideboard
oh
no
thanks
not
even
a
cigarette
holding
out
the
box
and
looking
up
at
him
she
appealed
with
a
long
anxious
glance
that
he
should
honour
her
cigarettes
thank
you
he
said
i
should
like
a
cigarette
very
much
she
lit
a
match
for
him
but
you
do
you
not
smoke
yes
sometimes
try
one
of
mine
for
a
change
he
produced
a
long
thin
gold
stuffed
with
cigarettes
she
lit
a
cigarette
from
his
oh
she
cried
after
a
few
violent
puffs
i
like
enormously
your
cigarettes
where
are
they
to
be
found
look
said
he
i
will
put
these
few
in
your
box
and
he
poured
twenty
cigarettes
into
an
empty
compartment
of
the
box
which
was
divided
into
two
not
all
she
protested
yes
but
i
say
no
she
insisted
with
a
gesture
suddenly
firm
and
put
a
single
cigarette
back
into
his
case
and
shut
the
case
with
a
snap
and
herself
returned
it
to
his
pocket
one
ought
never
to
be
without
a
cigarette
he
said
you
understand
life
how
nice
it
is
here
he
looked
about
and
then
sighed
but
why
do
you
sigh
sigh
of
content
i
was
just
thinking
this
place
would
be
something
else
if
an
english
girl
had
it
it
is
curious
lamentable
that
english
girls
understand
nothing
certainly
not
love
as
for
that
i
always
heard
so
they
understand
nothing
not
even
warmth
one
is
cold
in
their
rooms
as
for
that
i
mean
warmth
one
may
say
that
i
understand
it
i
do
you
understand
more
than
warmth
what
is
your
name
christine
she
was
the
accidental
daughter
of
a
daughter
of
joy
the
mother
as
frequently
happens
in
these
cases
dreamed
of
perfect
respectability
for
her
child
and
kept
christine
in
the
country
far
away
in
paris
meaning
to
provide
a
good
dowry
in
due
course
at
she
had
not
got
the
dowry
together
nor
even
begun
to
get
it
together
and
she
was
feckless
dilatory
and
extravagant
she
saw
as
in
a
vision
her
own
shortcomings
and
how
they
might
involve
disaster
for
christine
christine
she
perceived
was
a
girl
imperfectly
educated
for
in
the
affair
of
christine
education
the
mother
had
not
aimed
high
enough
indolent
but
economical
affectionate
and
with
a
very
great
deal
of
temperament
actuated
by
deep
maternal
solicitude
she
brought
her
daughter
back
to
paris
and
had
her
inducted
into
the
profession
under
the
most
decent
auspices
at
nineteen
christine
second
education
was
complete
most
of
it
the
mother
had
left
to
others
from
a
sense
of
propriety
but
she
herself
had
instructed
christine
concerning
the
five
great
plagues
of
the
profession
and
also
she
had
adjured
her
never
to
drink
alcohol
save
professionally
never
to
invest
in
anything
save
bonds
of
the
city
of
paris
never
to
seek
celebrity
which
according
to
the
mother
meant
ultimate
ruin
never
to
mix
intimately
with
other
women
she
had
expounded
the
great
theory
that
generosity
towards
men
in
small
things
is
always
repaid
by
generosity
in
big
things
and
if
it
is
not
the
loss
is
so
slight
and
she
taught
her
the
fundamental
differences
between
nationalities
with
a
russian
you
had
to
eat
drink
and
listen
with
a
german
you
had
to
flatter
and
yet
adroitly
insert
do
not
imagine
that
i
am
here
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
with
an
italian
you
must
begin
with
finance
with
a
frenchman
you
must
discuss
finance
before
it
is
too
late
with
an
englishman
you
must
talk
for
he
will
not
but
in
no
circumstances
touch
finance
until
he
has
mentioned
it
in
each
case
there
was
a
risk
but
the
risk
should
be
faced
the
course
of
instruction
finished
christine
mother
had
died
with
a
clear
conscience
and
a
mind
consoled
said
christine
conversational
putting
the
question
that
lips
seemed
then
to
articulate
of
themselves
in
obedience
to
its
imperious
demand
for
utterance
how
long
do
you
think
the
war
will
last
the
man
answered
with
serenity
the
war
has
not
begun
yet
how
english
you
are
but
all
the
same
i
ask
myself
whether
you
would
say
that
if
you
had
seen
belgium
i
came
here
from
ostend
last
month
the
man
gazed
at
her
with
new
vivacious
interest
so
it
is
like
that
that
you
are
here
but
do
not
let
us
talk
about
it
she
added
quickly
with
a
mournful
smile
no
no
he
agreed
i
see
you
have
a
piano
i
expect
you
are
fond
of
music
ah
she
exclaimed
in
a
fresh
relieved
tone
am
i
fond
of
it
i
adore
it
quite
simply
do
play
for
me
play
a
boston
a
i
ca
he
said
but
you
play
i
am
sure
of
it
and
you
he
parried
she
made
a
sad
negative
sign
well
i
play
something
out
of
ah
but
you
are
a
she
amiably
scrutinised
him
and
yet
no
smiling
he
too
made
a
sad
negative
sign
the
waltz
out
of
eh
oh
yes
a
waltz
i
prefer
waltzes
to
anything
as
soon
as
he
had
played
a
few
bars
she
passed
demurely
out
of
the
through
the
main
part
of
the
bedroom
into
the
de
she
moved
about
in
the
de
thinking
that
the
waltz
out
of
was
divinely
exciting
the
delicate
sound
of
her
movements
and
the
plash
of
water
came
to
him
across
the
bedroom
as
he
played
he
threw
a
glance
at
her
now
and
then
he
could
see
well
enough
but
not
very
well
because
the
smoke
of
the
shortening
cigarette
was
in
his
eyes
she
returned
at
length
into
the
carrying
a
small
silk
bag
about
five
inches
by
three
the
waltz
finished
but
you
take
cold
he
murmured
no
at
home
i
never
take
cold
besides
smiling
at
him
as
he
swung
round
on
the
she
undid
the
bag
and
drew
from
it
some
folded
stuff
which
she
slowly
shook
out
rather
in
the
manner
of
a
conjurer
until
it
was
revealed
as
a
kimono
she
laughed
is
it
not
marvellous
it
is
that
is
what
i
wear
in
the
way
of
chiffons
it
is
the
only
fantasy
i
have
bought
up
to
the
present
in
london
of
course
clothes
i
have
been
forced
to
buy
clothes
it
matches
exquisitely
the
stockings
eh
she
slid
her
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
the
transparency
she
was
a
pretty
and
highly
developed
girl
of
short
still
lissom
but
with
the
fear
of
corpulence
in
her
heart
she
had
beautiful
hair
and
beautiful
eyes
and
she
had
that
pucker
of
the
forehead
denoting
according
to
circumstances
either
some
kindly
grave
preoccupation
or
a
benevolent
perplexity
about
something
or
other
she
went
near
him
and
clasped
hands
round
his
neck
and
whispered
your
waltz
was
adorable
you
are
an
artist
and
with
her
shoulders
she
seemed
to
sketch
the
movements
of
dancing
chapter
confidence
after
putting
on
his
thick
overcoat
and
one
glove
he
had
suddenly
darted
to
the
for
his
watch
which
he
was
forgetting
christine
face
showed
sympathetic
satisfaction
that
he
had
remembered
in
time
simultaneously
implying
that
even
if
he
had
not
remembered
the
watch
would
have
been
perfectly
safe
till
he
called
for
it
the
hour
was
five
minutes
to
midnight
he
was
just
going
christine
had
dropped
a
little
batch
of
black
and
red
treasury
notes
on
to
the
with
an
indifferent
if
not
perhaps
an
impatient
air
as
though
she
held
these
financial
sequels
to
be
a
stain
on
the
ideal
a
tedious
necessary
a
nuisance
or
simply
negligible
she
kissed
him
goodbye
and
felt
agreeably
fragile
and
soft
within
the
embrace
of
his
huge
rough
overcoat
and
she
breathed
winningly
delicately
apologetically
into
his
ear
thou
wilt
give
something
to
the
servant
her
soft
eyes
seemed
to
say
it
is
not
for
myself
that
i
am
asking
is
it
he
made
an
easy
philanthropic
gesture
to
indicate
that
the
servant
would
have
no
reason
to
regret
his
passage
he
opened
the
door
into
the
little
hall
where
the
fat
italian
maid
was
yawning
in
an
atmosphere
comparatively
cold
and
then
in
a
change
of
purpose
he
shut
the
door
again
you
do
not
know
how
i
knew
you
could
not
have
been
in
london
very
long
he
said
confidentially
no
because
i
saw
you
in
paris
one
night
in
july
at
the
marigny
theatre
not
at
the
marigny
yes
the
marigny
it
is
true
i
recall
it
i
wore
white
and
a
yellow
stole
yes
you
stood
on
the
seat
at
the
back
of
the
promenade
to
see
a
contortionist
girl
better
and
then
you
jumped
down
i
thought
you
were
delicious
quite
delicious
thou
flatterest
me
thou
sayest
that
to
flatter
me
no
no
i
assure
you
i
went
to
the
marigny
every
night
for
five
nights
afterwards
in
order
to
find
you
but
the
marigny
is
not
my
regular
olympia
is
my
regular
i
went
to
olympia
and
all
the
other
halls
too
each
night
ah
yes
then
i
must
have
left
paris
but
why
my
poor
friend
why
didst
thou
not
speak
to
me
at
the
marigny
i
was
alone
i
do
know
i
hesitated
i
suppose
i
was
afraid
thou
so
i
was
terribly
content
to
meet
you
when
i
saw
that
it
was
really
you
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
she
understood
now
his
agitation
on
first
accosting
her
in
the
promenade
the
affair
very
pleasantly
grew
more
serious
for
her
she
liked
him
he
had
nice
eyes
he
was
fairly
tall
and
broadly
built
but
not
a
bit
stout
neither
dark
nor
blond
not
handsome
and
yet
beneath
a
certain
superficial
freedom
he
was
reserved
he
had
beautiful
manners
he
was
refined
and
he
was
refined
in
love
and
yet
he
knew
something
she
very
highly
esteemed
refinement
in
a
man
she
had
never
met
a
refined
woman
and
was
convinced
that
few
such
existed
of
course
he
was
rich
she
could
be
quite
sure
from
his
way
of
handling
money
that
he
was
accustomed
to
handling
money
she
would
swear
he
was
a
bachelor
merely
on
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
yes
the
affair
had
lovely
possibilities
afraid
to
speak
to
her
and
then
ran
round
paris
after
her
for
five
nights
had
he
then
had
the
from
her
it
appeared
so
and
why
not
she
was
not
like
other
girls
and
this
she
had
always
known
she
did
precisely
the
same
things
as
other
girls
did
true
but
somehow
subtly
inexplicably
when
she
did
them
they
were
not
the
same
things
the
proof
he
so
refined
and
distinguished
himself
had
felt
the
difference
she
became
very
tender
to
think
she
murmured
that
only
on
that
one
night
in
all
my
life
did
i
go
to
the
marigny
and
you
saw
me
the
coincidence
frightened
her
she
might
have
missed
this
nice
dependable
admiring
creature
for
ever
but
the
coincidence
also
delighted
her
strengthening
her
superstition
the
hand
of
destiny
was
obviously
in
this
affair
was
it
not
astounding
that
on
one
night
of
all
nights
he
should
have
been
at
the
marigny
was
it
not
still
more
astounding
that
on
one
night
of
all
nights
he
should
have
been
in
the
promenade
in
leicester
square
the
affair
was
ordained
since
before
the
beginning
of
time
therefore
it
was
serious
ah
my
friend
she
said
if
only
you
had
spoken
to
me
that
night
at
the
marigny
you
might
have
saved
me
from
troubles
frightful
fantastic
how
he
had
confided
in
her
and
at
the
right
moment
with
her
human
lore
she
could
not
have
respected
a
man
who
had
begun
by
admitting
to
a
strange
and
unproved
woman
that
for
five
days
and
nights
he
had
gone
mad
about
her
to
do
so
would
have
been
folly
on
his
part
but
having
withheld
his
wild
secret
he
had
charmingly
showed
by
the
gesture
of
opening
and
then
shutting
the
door
that
at
last
it
was
too
strong
for
his
control
such
candour
deserved
candour
in
return
despite
his
age
he
looked
just
then
attractively
sympathetically
boyish
he
was
a
benevolent
creature
the
responsive
kindliness
of
his
enquiring
how
was
beyond
question
genuine
once
more
in
the
warm
and
comfort
of
her
home
the
contrast
between
the
masculine
thick
rough
overcoat
and
the
feminine
diaphanous
useless
kimono
appealed
to
her
soul
it
seemed
to
justify
even
to
call
for
confidence
from
her
to
him
the
italian
woman
behind
the
door
coughed
impatiently
and
was
not
heard
chapter
ostend
in
july
she
had
gone
to
ostend
with
an
american
a
gentleman
but
mad
one
of
those
men
with
a
fixed
idea
that
everything
would
always
be
all
right
and
that
nothing
really
and
permanently
uncomfortable
could
possibly
happen
a
very
fair
man
with
red
hair
and
radiating
wrinkles
all
round
his
eyes
phenomenon
due
to
his
humorous
outlook
on
the
world
he
laughed
at
her
because
she
travelled
with
all
her
bonds
of
the
city
of
paris
on
her
person
he
had
met
her
one
night
and
the
next
morning
suggested
the
ostend
excursion
too
sudden
too
capricious
of
course
but
she
had
always
desired
to
see
the
cosmopolitanism
of
ostend
trouville
she
did
not
like
as
you
had
sand
with
every
meal
if
you
lived
near
the
front
hotel
astoria
at
ostend
complete
flat
in
the
hotel
very
chic
the
one
the
had
broad
ideas
very
broad
ideas
of
what
was
due
to
a
woman
in
fact
one
might
say
that
he
carried
generosity
in
details
to
excess
but
naturally
with
americans
it
was
necessary
to
be
surprised
at
nothing
the
said
steadily
that
war
would
not
break
out
he
said
so
until
the
day
on
which
it
broke
out
he
then
became
a
turk
yes
a
turk
he
assumed
rights
over
her
the
rights
of
protection
but
very
strange
rights
he
would
not
let
her
try
to
return
to
paris
he
said
the
germans
might
get
to
paris
but
to
ostend
never
because
of
the
english
difficult
to
believe
but
he
had
locked
her
up
in
the
complete
flat
the
ostend
season
had
collapsed
pluff
like
that
the
hotel
staff
vanished
almost
entirely
one
or
two
old
fat
belgian
women
on
the
bedroom
floors
that
seemed
to
be
all
the
was
exquisitely
polite
but
very
firm
in
fine
he
was
a
master
it
was
astonishing
what
he
did
they
were
the
sole
remaining
guests
in
the
astoria
and
they
remained
because
he
refused
to
permit
the
management
to
turn
him
out
weeks
passed
yes
weeks
english
forces
came
to
ostend
marvellous
among
nations
there
was
none
like
the
english
she
did
not
see
them
herself
she
was
ill
the
had
told
her
that
she
was
ill
when
she
was
not
ill
but
lo
the
next
day
she
was
ill
oh
a
long
time
the
told
her
the
news
battle
of
the
marne
and
all
species
of
glorious
deeds
an
old
fat
belgian
told
her
a
different
kind
of
news
the
stories
of
the
fall
of
liége
namur
brussels
antwerp
the
massacres
at
aerschot
at
louvain
terrible
stories
that
travelled
from
mouth
to
mouth
among
women
there
was
always
rape
and
blood
and
filth
mingled
stories
of
a
frightful
fascination
unrepeatable
ah
the
had
informed
her
one
day
that
the
belgian
government
had
come
to
ostend
proof
enough
according
to
him
that
ostend
could
not
be
captured
by
the
germans
after
that
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
belgian
government
for
many
days
and
then
one
day
he
had
informed
her
casually
that
the
belgian
government
was
about
to
leave
ostend
by
steamer
but
days
earlier
the
old
fat
woman
had
told
her
that
the
german
staff
had
ordered
rooms
at
the
hôtel
des
postes
at
ghent
rooms
and
that
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
ghent
had
become
a
city
of
the
dead
thousands
of
refugees
in
ostend
thousands
of
escaped
virgins
thousands
of
wounded
soldiers
often
the
sound
of
guns
all
day
and
all
night
and
in
the
daytime
occasionally
a
sharp
sound
very
loud
that
meant
that
a
german
aeroplane
was
over
the
town
killing
plenty
to
kill
ostend
was
always
full
behind
the
digue
and
yet
people
were
always
leaving
by
steamer
steamers
taken
by
assault
at
first
there
had
been
formalities
permits
passports
but
when
one
steamer
had
been
taken
by
assault
no
more
formalities
in
trying
to
board
the
steamers
people
were
drowned
they
fell
into
the
water
and
nobody
troubled
so
said
the
old
woman
christine
was
better
desired
to
rise
the
said
no
not
yet
he
would
believe
naught
and
now
he
believed
one
thing
and
it
filled
his
mind
that
german
submarines
sank
all
refugee
ships
in
the
north
sea
proof
of
the
folly
of
leaving
ostend
yet
immediately
afterwards
he
came
and
told
her
to
get
up
that
is
to
say
she
had
been
up
for
several
days
but
not
outside
he
told
her
to
come
away
come
away
she
had
only
summer
clothes
and
it
was
what
a
climate
ostend
in
october
the
old
woman
said
that
thousands
of
parcels
of
clothes
for
refugees
had
been
sent
by
generous
england
she
got
a
parcel
she
had
means
of
getting
it
she
opened
it
with
pride
in
the
bedroom
of
the
flat
it
contained
eight
corsets
and
a
a
droll
race
all
the
same
the
english
had
they
no
imagination
but
no
doubt
society
women
were
the
same
everywhere
it
was
notorious
that
in
france
christine
went
forth
in
her
summer
clothes
the
had
got
an
old
he
gave
her
much
american
money
or
rather
cheques
which
true
enough
she
had
since
cashed
with
no
difficulty
in
london
they
had
to
leave
the
carriage
the
station
square
was
full
of
guns
and
women
and
children
and
bundles
yes
together
with
a
few
men
she
spent
the
whole
night
in
the
station
square
with
the
in
her
summer
clothes
and
his
overcoat
at
six
in
the
evening
it
was
already
dark
a
night
interminable
babies
crying
one
heard
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
square
a
baby
had
been
born
she
christine
sat
next
to
a
young
mother
with
a
baby
both
mother
and
baby
had
the
right
arm
bandaged
they
had
both
been
shot
through
the
arm
with
the
same
bullet
it
was
near
aerschot
the
young
woman
also
told
her
no
she
could
not
relate
that
to
an
englishman
happily
it
did
not
rain
but
the
wind
and
the
cold
in
the
morning
the
put
her
on
to
a
she
had
nothing
but
her
bonds
of
the
city
of
paris
and
her
american
cheques
the
crush
was
frightful
the
captain
of
the
however
comprehended
what
discipline
was
he
made
much
money
the
would
not
come
he
said
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
had
all
his
papers
for
the
rest
the
captain
would
not
let
him
come
though
doubtless
the
captain
could
have
been
bribed
as
they
left
the
harbour
with
other
trawlers
they
could
see
the
quays
all
covered
with
the
disappointed
waiting
somebody
in
the
boat
said
that
the
germans
had
that
morning
reached
she
forgot
the
name
of
the
place
but
it
was
the
next
village
to
ostend
on
the
bruges
road
thus
christine
parted
from
the
mad
always
wrong
even
about
the
german
submarines
but
truly
what
a
voyage
what
adventures
with
the
charitable
people
in
england
people
who
resembled
nothing
else
on
earth
people
who
did
not
understand
what
life
was
no
understanding
of
that
which
it
is
life
in
fine
however
she
should
stay
in
england
it
was
the
only
country
in
which
one
could
have
confidence
she
was
trying
to
sell
the
furniture
of
her
flat
in
paris
complications
under
the
emergency
law
she
was
not
obliged
to
pay
her
rent
to
the
landlord
but
if
she
removed
her
furniture
then
she
would
have
to
pay
the
rent
what
did
it
matter
though
besides
she
might
not
be
able
to
sell
her
furniture
after
all
remarkably
few
women
in
paris
at
that
moment
were
in
a
financial
state
to
buy
furniture
ah
no
but
i
have
not
told
you
the
tenth
part
said
christine
terrible
terrible
murmured
the
man
all
the
heavy
sorrow
of
the
world
lay
on
her
puckered
brow
and
floated
in
her
dark
glistening
eyes
then
she
smiled
sadly
but
with
courage
i
will
come
to
see
you
again
said
the
man
comfortingly
are
you
here
in
the
afternoons
every
afternoon
naturally
well
i
will
come
not
the
day
after
already
long
before
interrupting
the
buttoning
of
his
collar
she
had
whispered
softly
persuasively
clingingly
in
the
classic
manner
thou
art
content
thou
wilt
return
and
he
had
said
that
goes
without
saying
but
not
with
quite
the
same
conviction
as
he
now
used
in
speaking
definitely
of
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
the
fact
was
he
was
moved
she
too
she
had
been
right
not
to
tell
the
story
earlier
and
equally
right
to
tell
it
before
he
departed
some
men
most
men
hated
to
hear
any
tale
of
real
misfortune
at
any
moment
from
a
woman
because
of
course
it
diverted
their
thoughts
in
thus
departing
at
once
the
man
showed
characteristic
tact
her
recital
left
nothing
to
be
said
they
kissed
again
rather
like
comrades
christine
was
still
the
vessel
of
the
heavy
sorrow
of
the
world
but
in
the
kiss
and
in
their
glances
was
an
implication
that
the
effective
triumphant
antidote
to
sorrow
might
be
found
in
a
mutual
trust
he
opened
the
door
the
italian
woman
yawning
and
with
her
hand
open
was
tenaciously
waiting
alone
carefully
refolding
the
kimono
in
its
original
creases
christine
wondered
what
the
man
name
was
she
felt
that
the
mysterious
future
might
soon
disclose
a
germ
of
happiness
chapter
the
albany
hoape
he
was
usually
addressed
as
by
his
friends
and
always
referred
to
as
by
both
friends
and
acquaintances
woke
up
finally
in
the
bedroom
of
his
flat
with
the
thought
i
shall
see
her
he
inhabited
one
of
the
three
flats
at
the
extreme
northern
end
of
the
albany
piccadilly
the
flat
was
strangely
planned
its
shape
as
a
whole
was
that
of
a
cube
imagine
the
cube
to
be
divided
perpendicularly
into
two
very
unequal
parts
the
larger
part
occupying
nearly
of
the
entire
cubic
space
was
the
a
noble
chamber
large
and
lofty
the
smaller
part
was
cut
horizontally
into
two
storeys
the
lower
storey
comprised
a
very
small
hall
a
fair
bathroom
the
tiniest
staircase
in
london
and
very
small
bedroom
the
upper
storey
comprised
a
very
small

kitchen
and
servants
quarters
the
door
between
the
bedroom
and
the
drawing
room
left
open
in
the
night
for
ventilation
had
been
softly
closed
as
usual
during
final
sleep
and
the
bedroom
was
in
absolute
darkness
save
for
a
faint
grey
gleam
over
the
valance
of
the
window
curtains
could
think
he
wondered
whether
he
was
in
love
he
hoped
he
was
in
love
and
the
fact
that
the
woman
who
attracted
him
was
a
courtesan
did
not
disturb
him
in
the
least
he
was
nearing
fifty
years
of
age
he
had
casually
known
hundreds
of
courtesans
in
sundry
capitals
a
few
of
them
very
agreeable
also
a
number
of
women
calling
themselves
sometimes
correctly
actresses
all
of
whom
for
various
reasons
which
need
not
be
given
had
proved
very
unsatisfactory
but
he
had
never
loved
unless
it
might
be
mildly
concepcion
and
concepcion
was
now
a
war
bride
he
wanted
to
love
he
had
never
felt
about
any
woman
not
even
about
concepcion
as
he
felt
about
the
woman
seen
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
marigny
theatre
and
then
for
five
successive
nights
vainly
searched
for
in
all
the
chief
of
paris
a
nice
name
christine
it
suited
her
he
had
given
her
up
never
expected
to
catch
sight
of
her
again
but
she
had
remained
a
steadfast
memory
sad
and
charming
the
encounter
in
the
promenade
in
leicester
square
was
such
a
piece
of
heavenly
and
incredible
luck
that
it
had
at
the
moment
positively
made
him
giddy
the
first
visit
to
christine
flat
had
beatified
and
stimulated
him
would
the
second
anyhow
she
was
the
most
alluring
woman
and
yet
apparently
of
dependable
character
he
had
ever
met
no
other
consideration
counted
with
him
there
was
a
soft
knock
the
door
was
pushed
and
wavy
reflections
of
the
fire
played
on
the
corner
of
the
bedroom
ceiling
braiding
came
in
had
known
it
was
she
by
the
caressing
quality
of
the
knock
braiding
was
his
cook
and
the
wife
of
his
man
it
was
not
her
place
to
come
in
but
occasionally
because
something
had
happened
to
braiding
she
did
come
in
she
drew
the
curtains
apart
and
the
day
of
vigo
street
pale
dirty
morose
feebly
and
perfunctorily
took
possession
of
the
bedroom
braiding
having
drawn
the
curtains
returned
to
the
door
and
from
the
doorway
said
breakfast
is
practically
ready
sir
perceived
that
this
was
one
of
her
brave
resigned
mornings
since
august
she
had
borne
the
entire
weight
of
the
war
on
her
back
and
sometimes
the
burden
would
overpower
her
but
never
quite
switched
on
the
light
arose
from
his
bed
assumed
his
and
gazing
with
accustomed
pleasure
round
the
bedroom
saw
that
it
was
perfect
he
had
furnished
his
flat
in
the
regency
style
of
the
first
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
matured
by
george
smith
upholder
extraordinary
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
of
wales
the
pavilion
at
brighton
had
given
the
original
idea
to
who
saw
in
it
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
combining
the
somewhat
massive
dignity
suitable
to
a
bachelor
of
middling
age
with
the
bright
unconquerable
colours
which
the
eternal
twilight
of
london
demands
his
dome
bed
was
yellow
as
to
its
upper
works
with
crimson
valances
above
and
yellow
valances
below
the
crimson
curtains
of
course
never
closed
had
green
cords
and
tassels
and
the
counterpane
was
yellow
this
bed
was
a
modest
sample
of
the
careful
and
uncompromising
reconstitution
of
a
period
which
he
had
everywhere
carried
out
in
his
abode
the
with
its
moulded
ceiling
and
huge
recessed
window
had
presented
an
admirable
field
for
connoisseurship
here
the
clash
of
rich
primary
colours
the
perpendiculars
which
began
with
bronze
girls
heads
and
ended
with
bronze
girls
feet
or
animals
claws
the
vast
flat
surfaces
of
furniture
the
stiff
curves
of
wood
and
a
drapery
the
morbid
rage
for
solidity
which
would
employ
a
candelabrum
weighing
five
hundredweight
to
hold
a
single
wax
candle
produced
a
real
and
imposing
effect
of
style
it
was
a
style
debased
a
style
which
was
shedding
the
last
graces
of
french
empire
in
order
soon
to
appeal
to
a
victoria
determined
to
be
utterly
english
and
good
but
it
was
a
style
and
had
scamped
no
detail
even
the
pictures
were
hung
with
thick
tasselled
cords
of
the
regency
the
was
a
triumph
do
not
conceive
that
had
lost
his
head
about
furniture
and
that
his
notion
of
paradise
was
an
endless
series
of
shops
he
had
an
admirable
balance
and
he
held
that
a
man
might
make
a
faultless
interior
for
himself
and
yet
not
necessarily
lose
his
balance
he
resented
being
called
a
specialist
in
furniture
he
regarded
himself
as
an
amateur
of
life
and
if
a
specialist
in
anything
as
a
specialist
in
friendships
yet
he
was
a
solitary
man
liking
solitude
without
knowing
that
he
liked
it
and
in
the
midst
of
the
perfections
which
he
had
created
he
sometimes
gloomily
thought
what
in
the
name
of
god
am
i
doing
on
this
earth
he
went
into
the
and
there
by
the
fire
and
in
front
of
a
formidable
blue
chair
whose
arms
developed
into
the
grinning
heads
of
bronze
lions
stood
the
lacquered
table
consecrated
to
his
breakfast
tray
and
his
breakfast
tray
with
newspaper
and
correspondence
had
been
magically
placed
thereon
as
though
by
invisible
hands
and
on
one
arm
of
the
lay
the
rug
which
because
a
does
not
button
all
the
way
down
he
put
over
his
knees
while
breakfasting
in
winter
yes
he
admitted
with
pleasure
that
he
was
well
served
before
eating
he
opened
the
piano
a
modern
instrument
concealed
in
an
ingeniously
confected
regency
case
and
played
with
taste
a
bach
prelude
and
fugue
his
was
not
the
standardised
and
habituated
kind
of
musical
culture
which
takes
a
bach
prelude
and
fugue
every
morning
before
breakfast
with
or
without
a
glass
of
lithia
water
or
fizzy
saline
he
did
however
customarily
begin
the
day
at
the
piano
and
on
this
particular
morning
he
happened
to
play
a
bach
prelude
and
fugue
and
as
he
played
he
congratulated
himself
on
not
having
gone
to
seek
christine
in
the
promenade
on
the
previous
night
as
impatience
had
tempted
him
to
do
such
a
procedure
would
have
been
an
error
in
worldliness
and
bad
from
every
point
of
view
he
had
wisely
rejected
the
temptation
in
the
deep
blue
with
the
rug
over
his
knees
and
one
hand
on
a
lion
head
he
glanced
first
at
the
opened
because
of
the
war
among
the
few
letters
was
one
with
the
heading
of
the
reveille
motor
horn
company
like
his
father
had
been
a
solicitor
when
he
was
his
father
a
widower
had
died
and
left
him
a
respectable
fortune
and
a
very
good
practice
he
sold
half
the
practice
to
an
incoming
partner
and
four
years
later
he
sold
the
other
half
of
the
practice
to
the
same
man
at
thirty
he
was
free
and
this
result
had
been
attained
through
his
frank
negative
answer
to
the
question
the
law
bores
me
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
let
it
continue
to
bore
me
there
was
no
reason
instead
of
the
law
he
took
up
life
of
business
preoccupations
naught
remained
but
his
investments
he
possessed
a
gift
for
investing
money
he
had
helped
the
man
who
had
first
put
the
reveille
motor
horn
on
the
market
he
had
had
a
mighty
holding
of
shares
in
the
reveille
syndicate
limited
which
had
so
successfully
promoted
the
reveille
motor
horn
company
limited
and
in
the
latter
too
he
held
many
shares
the
reveille
motor
horn
company
had
prospered
and
had
gone
into
the
manufacture
of
speedometers
illuminating
outfits
and
all
manner
of
accessories
on
the
outbreak
of
war
had
given
himself
up
for
lost
this
is
the
end
he
had
said
as
a
member
of
the
investing
public
he
had
felt
sick
under
the
region
of
the
heart
in
particular
he
had
feared
for
his
reveille
shares
no
one
would
want
to
buy
expensive
motor
horns
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
war
that
the
world
etc
still
the
reveille
company
after
sustaining
the
shock
had
somehow
continued
to
do
a
pretty
good
business
it
had
patriotically
offered
its
plant
and
services
to
the
war
office
and
had
been
repulsed
with
contumely
and
ignominy
the
war
office
had
most
caustically
intimated
to
the
reveille
company
that
it
had
no
use
and
never
under
any
conceivable
circumstances
could
have
any
use
whatever
for
the
reveille
company
and
that
the
reveille
company
was
a
forward
and
tedious
jackanapes
unworthy
even
of
an
articulate
rebuff
now
the
autograph
letter
with
the
reveille
was
written
by
the
managing
director
who
represented
interests
on
the
board
and
it
stated
that
the
war
office
had
been
to
the
reveille
company
and
implored
it
to
enlarge
itself
and
given
it
vast
orders
at
grand
prices
for
all
sorts
of
things
that
it
had
never
made
before
the
profits
of
would
be
doubled
if
not
trebled
perhaps
quadrupled
was
relieved
uplifted
and
he
sniggered
at
his
terrible
forebodings
of
august
and
september
ruin
he
was
actually
going
to
make
money
out
of
the
greatest
war
that
the
world
etc
etc
and
why
not
somebody
had
to
make
money
and
somebody
had
to
pay
for
the
war
in
income
tax
for
the
first
time
the
incubus
of
the
war
seemed
lighter
upon
and
also
he
need
feel
no
slightest
concern
about
the
financial
aspect
of
any
possible
developments
of
the
christine
adventure
he
had
a
very
clear
and
undeniable
sensation
of
positive
happiness
chapter
for
the
empire
braiding
came
into
the
and
he
wondered
paternally
why
she
was
so
fidgety
and
why
her
tranquillising
mate
had
not
appeared
to
the
careless
observer
she
was
a
cheerful
woman
but
the
temple
of
her
brightness
was
reared
over
a
dark
and
frightful
crypt
in
which
the
demons
of
doubt
anxiety
and
despair
year
after
year
dragged
at
their
chains
intimidating
hope
slender
small
and
neat
she
passed
her
life
in
bravely
fronting
the
shapes
of
disaster
with
an
earnest
vivacious
upturned
face
she
was
and
her
aspect
recalled
the
pretty
respected
which
she
had
been
before
braiding
got
her
and
knocked
some
nonsense
out
of
her
and
turned
her
into
a
wife
still
paternally
but
firmly
took
her
up
at
once
i
say
braiding
what
about
this
he
lifted
the
article
of
which
the
copper
was
beginning
to
show
through
the
sheffield
plating
yes
sir
it
does
look
rather
impoverished
does
it
but
i
told
braiding
to
use
the
new
i
bought
last
week
but
one
did
you
sir
i
was
very
happy
about
the
new
one
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
but
braiding
never
gave
me
your
instructions
in
regard
to
it
she
glanced
at
the
cabinet
in
which
the
new
reposed
with
other
antique
braiding
been
rather
upset
this
last
few
days
sir
what
about
this
recruiting
sir
of
course
you
are
aware
he
decided
on
it
i
not
aware
of
anything
of
the
sort
said
rather
roughly
perhaps
to
hide
his
sudden
emotion
perhaps
to
express
his
irritation
at
braiding
strange
habit
of
pretending
that
the
most
startling
pieces
of
news
were
matters
of
common
knowledge
well
sir
of
course
you
were
out
most
of
yesterday
and
you
dined
at
the
club
braiding
attended
at
a
recruiting
office
yesterday
sir
he
stood
three
hours
in
the
crowd
outside
because
there
was
no
room
inside
and
then
he
stood
over
two
hours
in
a
passage
inside
before
his
turn
came
and
nothing
to
eat
all
day
or
drink
either
and
when
his
turn
came
and
they
asked
him
his
age
he
said
and
the
person
was
very
angry
and
said
he
had
any
time
to
waste
and
braiding
had
better
go
outside
again
and
consider
whether
he
made
a
mistake
about
his
age
so
braiding
went
outside
and
considered
that
his
age
was
only
after
all
but
he
could
get
in
again
not
by
any
means
so
he
just
came
back
here
and
i
gave
him
a
good
tea
and
he
needed
it
sir
but
he
saw
me
last
night
and
he
never
said
anything
yes
sir
braiding
admitted
with
pain
i
asked
him
if
he
had
told
you
and
he
said
he
had
and
that
i
must
where
is
he
now
he
went
off
early
sir
so
as
to
get
a
good
place
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
he
in
the
army
by
this
time
i
know
it
not
the
right
way
of
going
about
things
and
braiding
only
excuse
is
for
the
empire
when
it
a
question
of
the
empire
sir
at
that
instant
the
white
man
burden
was
braiding
and
the
glance
of
her
serious
face
showed
what
the
crushing
strain
of
it
was
i
think
he
might
have
told
me
well
sir
i
very
sorry
very
sorry
but
you
know
what
braiding
is
felt
that
that
was
just
what
he
did
not
know
or
at
any
rate
had
not
hitherto
known
he
was
hurt
by
braiding
conduct
he
had
always
treated
braiding
as
a
friend
they
had
daily
discussed
the
progress
of
the
war
on
the
previous
night
braiding
in
all
the
customary
sedateness
of
black
coat
and
faintly
striped
trousers
had
behaved
just
as
usual
it
was
astounding
began
to
incline
towards
the
views
of
certain
of
his
friends
about
the
utter
incomprehensibility
of
the
servile
classes
views
which
he
had
often
annoyed
them
by
traversing
yes
it
was
astounding
all
this
martial
imperialism
seething
in
the
depths
of
braiding
and
never
suspecting
the
ferment
exceedingly
difficult
to
conceive
braiding
as
a
soldier
he
was
the
albany
valet
and
albany
valets
were
albany
valets
and
naught
else
braiding
continued
it
very
inconsiderate
to
you
sir
that
a
point
that
is
appreciated
by
both
braiding
and
i
but
let
us
fervently
hope
it
be
for
long
sir
the
consensus
of
opinion
seems
to
be
we
shall
be
in
berlin
in
the
spring
and
in
the
meantime
i
think
she
smiled
an
appeal
i
can
manage
for
you
by
myself
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
oh
it
not
that
said
carelessly
i
expect
you
can
manage
all
right
oh
cried
she
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
sir
and
i
very
sorry
and
at
best
it
bound
to
be
highly
inconvenient
for
a
gentleman
like
yourself
sir
i
said
to
braiding
taking
advantage
of
hoape
good
nature
that
what
i
said
to
braiding
and
he
could
deny
it
however
sir
if
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
try
what
i
can
do
by
myself
i
tell
you
that
be
all
right
he
stopped
her
braiding
his
mainstay
was
irrevocably
gone
he
realised
that
and
it
was
a
severe
blow
he
must
accept
it
as
for
braiding
managing
she
would
manage
in
a
kind
of
way
but
the
risks
to
regency
furniture
and
china
would
be
grave
she
did
not
understand
regency
furniture
and
china
as
braiding
did
no
woman
could
braiding
had
been
as
much
a
find
as
the
dome
bed
or
the
unique
bookcase
which
bore
the
names
of
homer
and
virgil
in
bronze
characters
on
its
outer
wings
also
had
a
hundred
little
ways
about
neckties
and
about
which
he
would
have
to
teach
braiding
still
the
war
when
she
was
gone
he
stood
up
and
brushed
the
crumbs
from
his
and
emitted
a
short
harsh
laugh
he
was
laughing
at
himself
regency
furniture
and
china
neckties
in
the
next
room
was
a
youngish
woman
whose
minstrel
boy
to
the
war
had
gone
gone
though
he
might
be
only
in
the
next
street
and
had
she
said
a
word
about
her
feelings
as
a
wife
not
a
word
but
dozens
of
words
about
the
inconvenience
to
the
employer
she
had
apologised
to
him
because
braiding
had
departed
to
save
the
empire
without
first
asking
his
permission
it
was
not
merely
astounding
it
flabbergasted
he
had
always
felt
that
there
was
something
fundamentally
wrong
in
the
social
fabric
and
he
had
long
had
a
preoccupation
to
the
effect
that
it
was
his
business
his
to
take
a
share
in
finding
out
what
was
wrong
and
in
discovering
and
applying
a
cure
this
preoccupation
had
worried
him
scarcely
perceptibly
like
the
delicate
oncoming
of
neuralgia
there
must
be
something
wrong
when
a
member
of
one
class
would
behave
to
a
member
of
another
class
as
braiding
behaved
to
him
without
protest
from
him
mrs
braiding
he
called
out
yes
sir
she
almost
ran
back
into
the
when
shall
you
be
seeing
your
husband
at
least
he
would
remind
her
that
she
had
a
husband
i
have
an
idea
sir
well
when
you
do
tell
him
that
i
want
to
speak
to
him
and
you
can
tell
him
i
shall
pay
you
half
his
wages
in
addition
to
your
own
her
gratitude
filled
him
with
secret
fury
he
said
to
himself
futile
these
grand
gestures
about
wages
chapter
boots
in
the
very
small
hall
gazed
at
himself
in
the
mirror
that
was
nearly
as
large
as
the
bathroom
door
to
which
it
was
attached
and
which
it
ingeniously
masked
although
braiding
was
present
holding
his
ebony
stick
he
carefully
examined
his
face
and
appearance
without
the
slightest
nor
did
braiding
demeanour
indicate
that
in
her
opinion
was
behaving
in
a
manner
eccentric
or
incorrect
he
was
dressed
in
mourning
honestly
he
did
not
believe
that
he
looked
anywhere
near
fifty
his
face
was
worn
by
the
friction
of
the
world
especially
under
the
eyes
but
his
eyes
were
youthful
and
his
hair
and
moustache
and
short
fine
beard
scarcely
tinged
with
grey
his
features
showed
benevolence
with
a
certain
firmness
and
they
had
the
refinement
which
comes
of
half
a
century
instinctive
avoidance
of
excess
still
he
was
beginning
to
feel
his
age
he
moved
more
slowly
he
sat
down
instead
of
standing
up
at
the
and
he
was
beginning
also
to
take
a
pride
in
mentioning
these
changes
and
in
the
fact
that
he
would
be
fifty
on
his
next
birthday
and
when
talking
to
men
under
thirty
or
even
under
forty
he
would
say
in
a
tone
mingling
condescension
and
envy
but
of
course
you
young
he
departed
remarking
that
he
should
not
be
in
for
lunch
and
might
not
be
in
for
dinner
and
he
walked
down
the
covered
way
to
the
albany
courtyard
and
was
approved
by
the
albany
porters
as
a
resident
handsomely
conforming
to
the
traditional
high
standard
set
by
the
albany
for
its
residents
he
crossed
piccadilly
and
as
he
did
so
he
saw
a
couple
of
jolly
fine
girls
handsome
stylish
independent
of
carriage
swinging
freely
along
and
intimately
talking
with
that
mien
of
experience
and
which
some
girls
manage
to
wear
in
the
streets
one
of
them
in
particular
appealed
to
him
he
thought
how
different
they
were
from
christine
he
had
dreamt
of
just
such
girls
as
they
were
and
yet
now
christine
filled
the
whole
of
his
mind
you
ca
foresee
he
thought
he
dipped
down
into
the
extraordinary
rectangle
of
james
where
he
was
utterly
at
home
a
strange
architecture
parsimoniously
plain
on
the
outside
indeed
carrying
the
oriental
scorn
for
merely
external
effect
to
a
point
only
reachable
by
a
race
at
once
hypocritical
and
madly
proud
the
shabby
plainness
of
wren
church
well
typified
all
the
parochial
parsimony
the
despairing
architect
had
been
so
pinched
by
his
employers
in
the
matter
of
ornament
that
on
the
whole
of
the
northern
facade
there
was
only
one
of
his
favourite
cherub
heads
what
a
parish
it
was
a
parish
of
flat
brick
walls
and
brass
and
brass
plates
and
the
first
commandment
was
to
polish
every
brass
and
every
brass
plate
every
morning
what
happened
in
the
way
of
disfigurement
by
polishing
paste
to
the
surrounding
brick
or
wood
had
no
importance
the
conventions
of
the
parish
had
no
eye
save
for
brass
and
brass
plates
which
were
maintained
daily
in
effulgence
by
a
vast
population
recruiting
offices
casualty
lists
the
rumour
of
peril
and
of
glory
could
do
nothing
to
diminish
the
high
urgency
of
the
polishing
of
those
brass
and
those
brass
plates
the
shops
and
offices
seemed
to
show
that
the
wants
of
customers
were
few
and
simple
grouse
moors
fisheries
yachts
valuations
hosiery
neckties
insurance
assurance
antique
china
antique
pictures
boots
and
above
all
eastern
cigarettes
the
was
evidently
eastern
cigarettes
the
few
provision
shops
were
marmoreal
and
majestic
catering
as
they
did
chiefly
for
the
multifarious
palatial
male
clubs
which
dominated
the
parish
and
protected
and
justified
the
innumerable
bachelor
suites
that
hung
forth
signs
in
every
street
the
parish
in
effect
was
first
an
immense
monastery
where
the
monks
determined
to
do
themselves
extremely
well
in
dignified
peace
had
made
a
prodigious
and
not
entirely
unsuccessful
effort
to
keep
out
the
excitable
sex
and
second
it
was
an
excusable
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
intensely
respectable
tradesmen
and
stewards
to
force
the
sex
to
pay
the
highest
possible
price
for
the
privilege
of
doing
the
correct
thing
passed
through
the
cardiac
region
of
james
the
square
itself
where
knights
baronets
barons
brewers
viscounts
marquesses
hereditary
marshals
and
chief
butlers
dukes
bishops
banks
librarians
and
government
departments
gaze
throughout
the
four
seasons
at
the
statue
of
a
dutchman
and
then
he
found
himself
at
his
bootmaker
now
his
bootmaker
was
one
of
the
three
first
bootmakers
in
the
west
end
bearing
a
name
famous
from
peru
to
hong
kong
an
untidy
interior
full
of
old
boots
and
the
hides
of
various
animals
a
dirty
girl
was
writing
in
a
dirty
tome
and
a
young
man
was
knotting
together
two
pieces
of
string
in
order
to
tie
up
a
parcel
such
was
the
note
of
the
house
the
girl
smiled
the
young
man
bowed
in
an
instant
the
manager
appeared
and
was
invested
with
the
attributes
of
god
he
informed
the
manager
with
pain
and
the
manager
heard
with
deep
pain
that
the
left
boot
of
the
new
pair
he
then
wore
was
not
quite
comfortable
in
the
toes
the
manager
simply
could
not
understand
it
just
as
he
simply
could
not
have
understood
a
failure
in
the
working
of
the
law
of
gravity
and
if
god
had
not
told
him
he
would
not
have
believed
it
he
knelt
and
felt
he
would
send
for
the
boots
he
would
make
the
boots
comfortable
or
he
would
make
a
new
pair
expense
was
nothing
trouble
was
nothing
incidentally
he
remarked
with
a
sigh
that
the
enormous
demand
for
military
boots
was
rendering
it
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
give
to
old
patrons
that
prompt
and
plenary
attention
which
he
would
desire
to
give
however
god
in
any
case
should
not
suffer
he
noticed
that
the
boots
were
not
quite
well
polished
and
he
ventured
to
charge
god
with
hints
for
god
personal
attendant
then
he
went
swiftly
across
to
a
and
snapped
polisher
a
opened
in
the
floor
of
the
shop
and
a
horrible
pallid
weak
cringing
man
came
up
out
of
the
earth
of
james
and
knelt
before
god
far
more
submissively
than
even
the
manager
had
knelt
he
had
brushes
and
blacking
and
he
blacked
and
he
brushed
and
breathed
alternately
undoing
continually
with
his
breath
or
his
filthy
hand
what
he
had
done
with
his
brush
he
never
looked
up
never
spoke
when
he
had
made
the
boots
like
mirrors
he
gathered
together
his
implements
and
vanished
silent
and
dutifully
bent
through
the
back
into
the
earth
of
james
and
because
the
had
not
shut
properly
the
manager
stamped
on
it
and
stamped
down
the
pale
man
definitely
into
the
darkness
underneath
and
then
was
wafted
out
of
the
shop
with
smiles
and
bows
chapter
the
club
the
vast
of
the
monumental
club
among
clubs
for
its
architecture
was
on
the
whole
tonically
chilly
but
as
one
of
the
high
windows
stood
open
and
there
were
two
fires
fluttering
beneath
the
lovely
marble
mantelpieces
between
the
fires
and
the
window
every
gradation
of
temperature
could
be
experienced
by
the
curious
on
each
wall
rose
to
the
carved
and
gilded
ceiling
the
furlongs
of
shelves
were
fitted
with
majestic
volumes
containing
all
the
statutes
all
the
parliamentary
debates
and
all
the
reports
of
royal
commissions
ever
printed
to
narcotise
the
conscience
of
a
nation
these
works
were
not
in
fact
read
but
the
magnificent
pretence
of
their
usefulness
was
completed
by
carpeted
mahogany
ladders
which
leaned
here
and
there
against
the
shelfing
in
accord
with
the
theory
that
some
studious
member
some
day
might
yearn
and
aspire
to
some
upper
shelf
on
and
on
huge
mahogany
tables
were
disposed
the
countless
newspapers
of
great
britain
and
ireland
europe
and
america
and
also
the
files
of
such
newspapers
the
apparatus
of
information
was
complete
entered
the
splendid
apartment
like
a
discoverer
it
was
empty
not
a
member
not
a
servant
it
waited
content
to
be
inhabited
equally
content
with
its
own
solitude
this
apartment
had
made
an
adjunct
even
of
the
war
the
function
of
the
war
in
this
apartment
was
to
render
it
more
impressive
to
increase
if
possible
its
importance
for
nowhere
else
could
the
war
be
studied
so
minutely
day
by
day
a
strange
thing
sense
of
duty
to
himself
had
been
quickened
by
the
defection
of
his
valet
he
felt
that
he
had
been
failing
to
comprehend
in
detail
the
cause
and
the
evolution
of
the
war
and
that
even
his
general
ideas
as
to
it
were
inexcusably
vague
and
he
had
determined
to
go
every
morning
to
the
club
at
whatever
inconvenience
for
the
especial
purpose
of
studying
and
getting
the
true
hang
of
the
supreme
topic
as
he
sat
down
he
was
aware
of
the
solemnity
of
the
great
room
last
fastness
of
the
old
strict
decorum
in
the
club
you
might
not
smoke
in
it
until
after
two
other
members
came
in
immediately
one
after
the
other
the
first
a
little
very
old
and
very
natty
man
began
to
read
at
a
stand
the
second
old
too
but
of
larger
and
firmer
build
with
a
long
upper
lip
such
as
is
only
developed
at
the
bar
on
the
bench
and
in
provincial
circles
of
noncomformity
took
an
and
another
copy
of
a
few
moments
elapsed
and
then
the
little
old
man
glanced
round
and
assuming
surprise
that
he
had
not
noticed
earlier
nodded
to
him
with
a
very
bright
and
benevolent
smile
said
well
sir
francis
what
your
opinion
of
this
ypres
business
seems
pretty
complicated
does
it
sir
francis
answered
in
a
tone
whose
mild
and
bland
benevolence
matched
his
smile
i
dare
say
the
complications
escape
me
i
see
the
affair
quite
simply
we
are
holding
on
but
we
can
not
continue
to
hold
on
the
germans
have
more
men
far
more
guns
and
infinitely
more
ammunition
they
certainly
have
not
less
genius
for
war
what
can
be
the
result
i
am
told
by
respectable
people
that
the
germans
lost
the
war
at
the
marne
i
do
appreciate
it
i
am
told
that
the
germans
do
realise
the
marne
i
think
they
realise
the
marne
at
least
as
well
as
we
realise
tannenberg
the
slightly
trembling
slightly
mincing
voice
of
sir
francis
denoted
such
detachment
such
politeness
such
kindliness
that
the
opinion
it
emitted
seemed
to
impose
itself
on
with
extraordinary
authority
there
was
a
brief
pause
and
sir
francis
ejaculated
what
your
view
bob
the
other
old
man
now
consisted
of
a
newspaper
two
seamy
hands
and
a
pair
of
grey
legs
his
grim
voice
came
from
behind
the
newspaper
which
did
not
move
we
no
adequate
means
of
judging
true
said
sir
francis
now
another
thing
i
told
is
that
the
war
office
was
perfectly
ready
for
the
war
on
the
scale
agreed
upon
for
ourselves
with
france
and
russia
i
do
appreciate
that
either
no
war
office
can
be
said
to
be
perfectly
ready
for
any
war
until
it
has
organised
its
relations
with
the
public
which
it
serves
my
belief
is
that
the
war
office
had
never
thought
for
one
moment
about
the
military
importance
of
public
opinion
and
the
press
at
any
rate
it
has
most
carefully
left
nothing
undone
to
alienate
both
the
public
and
the
press
my
has
the
misfortune
to
own
seven
newspapers
and
the
tales
he
tells
about
the
antics
of
the
press
bureau
sir
francis
smiled
the
rest
of
the
sentence
let
me
see
they
offered
the
press
bureau
to
you
did
they
bob
fell
disclosing
bob
whose
long
upper
lip
grew
longer
they
did
he
said
i
made
a
few
inquiries
and
found
it
was
nothing
but
a
shuttlecock
of
the
departments
i
should
have
had
no
real
power
but
unlimited
quantities
of
responsibility
so
i
respectfully
refused
sir
francis
remarked
your
hearing
much
better
bob
it
is
answered
bob
the
fact
is
i
got
hold
of
a
marvellous
feller
at
birmingham
he
laughed
sardonically
i
hope
to
go
down
to
history
as
the
first
judge
that
ever
voluntarily
retired
because
of
deafness
and
now
thanks
to
this
feller
at
birmingham
i
can
hear
better
than
per
cent
of
the
bench
the
lord
chancellor
gave
me
a
hint
i
might
care
to
return
and
so
save
a
pension
to
the
nation
i
told
him
i
begin
to
think
about
that
when
he
persuaded
the
board
of
works
to
ventilate
my
old
court
he
laughed
again
and
now
i
see
the
press
bureau
is
enunciating
the
principle
that
it
wo
permit
criticism
that
might
in
any
way
weaken
the
confidence
of
the
people
in
the
administration
of
affairs
bob
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
kept
it
open
sir
francis
with
no
diminution
of
the
mild
and
bland
benevolence
of
his
detachment
said
the
voice
is
the
press
bureau
voice
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
the
war
office
can
we
reasonably
hope
to
win
or
not
to
lose
with
such
a
mentality
at
the
head
i
can
not
admit
that
the
war
office
has
changed
in
the
slightest
degree
in
a
hundred
years
from
time
to
time
a
brainy
civilian
walks
in
like
cardwell
or
haldane
and
saves
it
from
becoming
patently
ridiculous
but
it
never
really
alters
when
i
was
war
secretary
in
a
transient
government
it
was
precisely
the
same
as
it
had
been
in
the
reign
of
the
duke
of
cambridge
and
it
is
still
precisely
the
same
i
am
told
that
haldane
succeeded
in
teaching
our
generals
the
value
of
staff
work
as
distinguished
from
dashing
cavalry
charges
i
do
appreciate
that
the
staffs
are
still
wide
open
to
men
with
social
influence
and
still
closed
to
men
without
social
influence
my
grandson
is
full
of
great
modern
notions
about
tactics
he
may
have
talent
for
all
i
know
he
got
a
staff
appointment
because
he
came
to
me
and
i
spoke
ten
words
to
an
old
friend
of
mine
with
oak
leaves
in
the
club
next
door
but
one
no
questions
asked
i
mean
no
serious
questions
it
was
done
to
oblige
me
the
very
existence
of
the
empire
being
at
stake
according
to
all
accounts
so
that
i
venture
to
doubt
whether
we
going
to
hold
ypres
or
anything
else
bob
unimpressed
by
the
speech
burst
out
you
got
the
perspective
wrong
obviously
the
centre
of
gravity
is
no
longer
in
the
west
it
in
the
east
in
the
west
roughly
equilibrium
has
been
established
hence
poland
is
the
decisive
field
and
the
measure
of
the
russian
success
or
failure
is
the
measure
of
the
allied
success
or
failure
sir
francis
inquired
with
gentle
joy
then
we
all
right
the
russians
have
admittedly
recovered
from
tannenberg
if
there
is
any
truth
in
a
map
they
are
doing
excellently
they
more
brilliant
than
potsdam
and
they
can
put
two
men
into
the
field
to
the
germans
one
two
and
a
half
in
fact
bob
fiercely
rumbled
i
do
think
we
all
right
this
habit
of
thinking
in
men
is
dangerous
what
are
men
without
munitions
and
without
a
clean
administration
nothing
but
a
rabble
it
is
notorious
that
the
russians
are
running
short
of
munitions
and
that
the
administration
from
top
to
bottom
consists
of
outrageous
rascals
moreover
i
see
a
report
that
the
germans
have
won
a
big
victory
at
kutno
been
expecting
that
that
the
beginning
mark
me
yes
sir
francis
cheerfully
agreed
yes
we
spending
one
million
a
day
and
now
income
tax
is
doubled
the
country
can
not
stand
it
indefinitely
and
since
our
only
hope
lies
in
our
being
able
to
stand
it
indefinitely
there
is
no
hope
at
any
rate
for
unbiased
minds
facts
are
facts
i
fear
bob
cried
impatiently
unbiased
be
damned
i
do
want
to
be
unbiased
i
wo
be
i
had
enough
of
being
unbiased
when
i
was
on
the
bench
and
i
do
care
what
any
of
you
unbiased
people
say
i
believe
we
shall
win
suddenly
saw
a
boy
in
the
old
man
and
suddenly
he
too
became
boyish
remembering
what
he
had
said
to
christine
about
the
war
not
having
begun
yet
and
with
fervour
he
concurred
so
do
i
he
rose
moved
relieved
after
a
tension
which
he
had
not
noticed
until
it
was
broken
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
the
two
old
men
were
recalled
to
the
fact
of
his
presence
bob
raised
the
newspaper
again
sir
francis
asked
are
you
going
to
the
er
affair
in
the
city
yes
said
with
careful
unconcern
i
had
thought
of
going
my
granddaughter
worried
me
till
i
consented
to
take
her
i
got
two
tickets
but
no
sooner
had
i
arrayed
myself
this
morning
than
she
rang
me
up
to
say
that
her
baby
was
teething
and
she
could
leave
it
in
view
of
this
important
indisposition
i
sent
the
tickets
back
to
the
dean
and
changed
my
clothes
have
to
be
philosophers
i
say
hoape
they
tell
me
you
play
uncommonly
good
auction
bridge
i
play
said
modestly
but
no
better
than
i
ought
you
might
care
to
make
a
fourth
this
afternoon
in
the
i
should
have
been
delighted
to
but
i
got
one
of
these
at
six
again
he
spoke
with
careful
unconcern
masking
a
considerable
chapter
the
mission
the
great
dim
place
was
full
but
crowding
had
not
been
permitted
with
a
few
exceptions
in
the
outlying
parts
everybody
had
a
seat
was
favourably
placed
for
seeing
the
whole
length
of
the
interior
accustomed
to
the
restaurants
of
fashionable
hotels
theatrical
the
haunts
of
sport
clubs
and
courts
of
justice
he
soon
perceived
from
the
numerous
samples
which
he
himself
was
able
to
identify
that
all
the
london
worlds
were
fully
represented
in
the
multitude
the
official
world
the
political
the
clerical
the
legal
the
municipal
the
military
the
artistic
the
literary
the
dilettante
the
financial
the
sporting
and
the
world
whose
sole
object
in
life
apparently
is
to
be
observed
and
recorded
at
all
gatherings
to
which
admittance
is
gained
by
privilege
and
influence
alone
there
were
in
particular
women
the
names
and
countenances
and
family
history
of
whom
were
familiar
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
readers
even
in
the
most
distant
counties
and
who
never
missed
what
was
called
a
function
whether
brilliant
exclusive
or
merely
scandalous
at
murder
trials
at
the
sales
of
art
collections
at
the
birth
of
musical
comedies
at
boxing
matches
at
historic
debates
at
receptions
in
honour
of
the
renowned
at
luscious
divorce
cases
they
were
surely
present
and
the
entire
press
surely
noted
that
they
were
present
and
if
executions
had
been
public
they
would
in
the
same
religious
spirit
have
attended
executions
rousing
their
maids
at
milkmen
hours
in
order
that
they
might
assume
the
right
cunning
frock
to
fit
the
occasion
and
they
were
here
and
no
one
could
divine
why
or
how
or
to
what
eternal
end
hated
them
and
he
hated
the
solemn
that
brooded
over
the
haughty
faces
of
the
throng
he
hated
himself
for
having
accepted
a
ticket
from
the
friend
in
the
war
office
who
was
now
sitting
next
to
him
and
yet
he
was
pleased
too
a
disturbed
conscience
could
not
defeat
the
instinct
which
bound
him
to
the
whole
fashionable
and
powerful
assemblage
for
ever
afterwards
to
his
dying
hour
he
could
say
casually
modestly
as
a
matter
of
course
but
he
could
still
say
that
he
had
been
there
the
lord
mayor
and
sheriffs
tradesmen
glittering
like
oriental
potentates
passed
slowly
across
his
field
of
vision
he
thought
with
contempt
of
the
city
living
ghoulish
on
the
buried
past
and
obstinately
and
humanly
refusing
to
make
a
pile
of
its
putrefying
interests
set
fire
to
it
and
perish
thereon
the
music
began
it
was
the
dead
march
in
the
drums
suddenly
rent
the
soul
and
destroyed
every
base
and
petty
thought
that
was
there
clergy
headed
by
a
bishop
were
walking
down
the
cathedral
at
the
huge
doors
nearly
lost
in
the
heavy
twilight
of
november
noon
they
stopped
turned
and
came
back
the
coffin
swayed
into
view
covered
with
the
sacred
symbolic
bunting
and
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
eight
sergeants
of
the
old
regiments
of
the
dead
man
then
followed
the
five
five
full
generals
and
two
admirals
aged
men
and
some
of
them
had
reached
the
highest
dignity
without
giving
a
single
gesture
that
had
impressed
itself
on
the
national
mind
nonentities
apotheosised
by
seniority
and
some
showed
traces
of
the
bitter
rain
that
was
falling
in
the
fog
outside
then
the
primate
then
the
king
who
had
supervened
from
nowhere
the
magic
production
of
chamberlains
and
comptrollers
the
procession
headed
by
the
clergy
moved
slowly
amid
the
vistas
ending
in
the
dull
burning
of
stained
glass
through
the
congregation
in
mourning
and
in
khaki
through
the
lines
of
candelabra
towards
the
crowd
of
scarlet
under
the
dome
the
summit
of
the
dome
was
hidden
in
soft
mist
the
music
became
insupportable
in
its
sublimity
was
afraid
and
he
did
not
immediately
know
why
he
was
afraid
the
procession
came
nearer
it
was
upon
him
he
knew
why
he
was
afraid
and
he
averted
sharply
his
gaze
from
the
coffin
he
was
afraid
for
his
composure
if
he
had
continued
to
watch
the
coffin
he
would
have
burst
into
loud
sobs
only
by
an
extraordinary
effort
did
he
master
himself
many
other
people
lowered
their
faces
in
the
searchers
after
new
and
violent
sensations
were
having
the
time
of
their
lives
the
dead
march
with
its
intolerable
genius
had
ceased
the
coffin
guarded
by
flickering
candles
lay
on
the
lofty
catafalque
the
eight
sergeants
were
pretending
that
their
strength
had
not
been
in
the
least
degree
taxed
princes
the
illustrious
the
champions
of
allied
might
dark
indians
adventurers
even
germans
surrounded
the
catafalque
in
the
gloom
sympathised
with
the
man
in
the
coffin
the
simple
little
man
whose
mission
had
in
spite
of
him
grown
political
he
regretted
horribly
that
once
he
who
protested
that
he
belonged
to
no
party
had
said
of
the
dead
man
roberts
of
course
but
senile
yet
a
trifle
what
did
it
matter
and
how
he
loathed
to
think
that
the
name
of
the
dead
man
was
now
befouled
by
the
calculating
and
impure
praise
of
schemers
another
trifle
as
the
service
proceeded
was
overwhelmed
and
lost
in
the
grandeur
and
terror
of
existence
there
he
sat
grizzled
dignified
with
the
great
world
looking
as
though
he
belonged
to
the
great
world
and
he
felt
like
a
boy
like
a
child
like
a
helpless
infant
before
the
enormities
of
destiny
he
wanted
help
because
of
his
futility
he
could
do
nothing
or
so
little
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
training
himself
for
twenty
years
in
order
to
be
futile
at
a
crisis
requiring
crude
action
and
he
could
not
undo
twenty
years
the
war
loomed
about
him
with
existence
itself
he
thought
of
the
sergeant
who
as
recounted
that
morning
in
the
papers
had
led
a
victorious
storming
party
been
decorated
and
died
of
wounds
and
similar
deeds
were
being
done
at
that
moment
and
the
simple
little
man
in
the
coffin
was
being
tilted
downwards
from
the
catafalque
into
the
grave
close
by
wanted
surcease
were
it
but
for
an
hour
he
longed
acutely
unbearably
to
be
for
an
hour
with
christine
in
her
warm
stuffy
exciting
languorous
enervating
room
hermetically
sealed
against
the
war
then
he
remembered
the
tones
of
her
voice
as
she
had
told
her
belgian
adventures
was
it
love
was
it
tenderness
was
it
sensuality
the
difference
was
indiscernible
it
had
no
importance
against
the
stark
background
of
infinite
existence
all
human
beings
were
alike
and
all
their
passions
were
alike
the
gaunt
ruthless
autocrat
of
the
war
office
and
the
frail
crowned
descendant
of
kings
fronted
each
other
across
the
open
grave
and
the
coffin
sank
between
them
and
was
gone
from
the
choir
there
came
the
chanted
and
soothing
words
on
the
ear
the
distant
just
caught
them
clear
among
much
that
was
incomprehensible
an
intense
patriotism
filled
him
he
could
do
nothing
but
he
could
keep
his
head
keep
his
balance
practise
magnanimity
uphold
the
truth
amid
prejudice
and
superstition
and
be
kind
such
at
that
moment
seemed
to
be
his
mission
he
looked
round
and
pitied
instead
of
hating
the
searchers
after
sensations
a
being
called
the
garter
king
of
arms
stepped
forward
and
in
a
loud
voice
recited
the
earthly
titles
and
honours
of
the
simple
little
dead
man
and
although
few
qualities
are
commoner
than
physical
courage
the
whole
catalogue
seemed
ridiculous
and
tawdry
until
the
being
came
to
the
two
words
victoria
cross
the
being
having
lived
his
glorious
moments
withdrew
the
funeral
march
of
chopin
tramped
with
its
excruciating
dragging
tread
across
the
ruins
of
the
soul
and
finally
the
cathedral
was
startled
by
the
sudden
trumpets
of
the
last
post
and
the
ceremony
ended
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
said
the
young
officer
next
to
i
have
got
to
be
back
till
and
i
want
to
talk
music
for
a
change
do
you
know
i
putting
in
ninety
hours
a
week
at
the
ca
replied
with
an
affectation
of
jauntiness
i
engaged
for
lunch
sorry
who
you
lunching
with
mrs
smith
the
staff
officer
exclaimed
aghast
conception
yes
why
dear
heart
my
dear
chap

do
know
carlos
smith
been
killed
does
know
yet
i
only
heard
by
chance
news
came
through
just
as
i
left
nobody
knows
except
a
chap
or
two
in
casualties
they
wo
be
sending
out
wires
until
two
or
three
terrified
and
at
a
loss
murmured
what
am
i
to
do
then
you
know
her
extremely
well
do
you
you
ought
to
go
and
prepare
her
but
how
can
i
prepare
her
i
do
know
how
do
people
prepare
people
poor
thing
fought
against
the
incredible
fact
of
death
but
he
only
went
out
six
days
ago
they
have
been
married
three
weeks
the
central
hardness
of
the
other
disclosed
itself
as
he
said
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
what
does
it
matter
if
he
went
out
six
days
ago
or
six
weeks
ago
he
killed
well
of
course
you
must
go
indicate
a
rumour
tell
her
it
probably
false
but
you
thought
you
owed
it
to
her
to
warn
her
only
for
sake
do
mention
me
we
not
supposed
to
say
anything
you
know
seemed
to
see
his
mission
and
it
challenged
him
chapter
the
telegram
as
soon
as
had
been
let
into
the
abode
by
concepcion
venerable
the
voice
of
concepcion
came
down
to
him
from
above
who
is
your
oldest
and
dearest
friend
he
replied
marvellously
schooling
his
voice
to
a
similar
tone
of
cheerful
abruptness
difficult
to
say
not
at
all
it
your
beard
that
was
her
greeting
to
him
he
knew
she
was
recalling
an
old
declined
suggestion
of
hers
that
he
should
part
with
his
beard
the
practised
an
admirable
deafness
faithfully
to
confirm
concepcion
who
always
presumed
deafness
in
all
servants
looked
up
the
narrow
well
of
the
staircase
he
could
vaguely
see
concepcion
on
high
leaning
over
the
banisters
he
thought
she
was
rather
fluffilly
dressed
for
her
concepcion
inhabited
an
upper
part
in
a
street
largely
devoted
to
the
sale
of
grand
pianos
her
front
door
was
immediately
at
the
top
of
a
long
straight
narrow
stairway
so
that
whoever
opened
the
door
stood
one
step
higher
than
the
person
desiring
entrance
within
the
abode
which
was
fairly
spacious
more
and
more
stairs
went
up
and
up
my
motto
is
she
would
say
room
one
staircase
the
life
of
the
abode
was
on
the
busy
stairs
she
called
it
also
her
alpine
club
she
had
made
in
that
street
popular
among
the
select
and
had
therefore
caused
rents
to
rise
in
the
she
had
hung
a
horrible
enlarged
photographic
portrait
of
herself
with
a
mount
the
whole
framed
in
german
gilt
and
under
it
she
had
inscribed
presented
to
miss
concepcion
iquist
by
the
grateful
landlords
of
the
neighbourhood
as
a
slight
token
of
esteem
and
regard
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
iquist
brother
who
had
had
a
business
and
a
palace
at
lima
at
the
age
of
eighteen
her
last
surviving
parent
being
dead
she
had
come
to
london
and
started
to
keep
house
for
the
bachelor
iquist
who
at
that
very
moment
owing
to
a
fortunate
change
in
the
ministry
had
humorously
entered
the
cabinet
these
two
had
immediately
become
the
most
pair
in
london
london
in
this
phrase
signifying
the
few
thousand
people
who
do
talk
about
the
doings
of
other
people
unknown
to
them
and
being
neither
kings
princes
statesmen
artistes
artists
jockeys
nor
poisoners
the
iquists
had
led
the
set
which
had
ousted
the
old
quite
unintelligent
set
from
the
first
place
in
the
curiosity
of
the
everlasting
public
concepcion
had
wit
it
was
stated
that
she
furnished
her
uncle
with
the
finest
of
his
when
iquist
died
of
course
poor
concepcion
had
retired
to
the
upper
part
whence
though
her
position
was
naturally
weakened
she
still
took
a
hand
in
leading
the
set
had
grown
friendly
and
appreciative
of
her
for
the
simple
reason
that
she
had
singled
him
out
and
always
tried
to
please
him
even
when
taking
liberties
with
him
he
liked
her
because
she
was
different
from
her
set
she
had
a
masculine
mind
whereas
many
even
of
the
males
of
her
set
had
a
feminine
mind
she
was
exceedingly
well
educated
she
had
ideas
on
everything
and
she
never
failed
in
catching
an
allusion
she
would
criticise
her
set
very
honestly
her
attitude
to
it
and
to
herself
seemed
to
be
that
of
an
impartial
and
yet
indulgent
philosopher
withal
she
could
be
intensely
loyal
to
fools
and
worse
who
were
friends
as
for
the
public
she
was
apparently
convinced
of
the
sincerity
of
her
scorn
for
it
while
admitting
that
she
enjoyed
publicity
which
had
become
indispensable
to
her
as
a
drug
may
become
indispensable
moreover
there
was
her
wit
and
her
candid
queer
respect
for
yes
he
had
greatly
admired
her
for
her
qualities
he
did
not
however
greatly
admire
her
physique
she
was
tall
with
a
head
scarcely
large
enough
for
her
body
she
had
a
nice
snub
nose
which
in
another
woman
might
have
been
irresistible
she
possessed
very
little
physical
charm
and
showed
very
little
taste
in
her
neat
prim
frocks
not
merely
had
she
a
masculine
mind
but
she
was
somewhat
hard
a
egoist
she
swore
like
the
set
using
about
one
damn
or
one
bloody
to
every
four
cigarettes
of
which
she
smoked
perhaps
fifty
a
day
including
some
in
taxis
she
discussed
the
sexual
vagaries
of
her
friends
and
her
enemies
with
a
freedom
and
an
apparent
learning
which
were
remarkable
in
a
virgin
in
the
end
she
had
married
carlos
smith
and
characteristically
had
received
him
into
her
own
home
instead
of
going
to
his
as
a
fact
he
had
none
having
been
a
parent
darling
london
had
only
just
recovered
from
the
excitations
of
the
wedding
had
regarded
the
marriage
with
benevolence
perhaps
with
relief
anybody
else
coming
to
lunch
he
discreetly
inquired
of
his
familiar
the
she
breathed
a
negative
he
had
guessed
it
concepcion
had
meant
to
be
alone
with
him
having
married
for
love
and
her
husband
being
rapt
away
by
the
war
she
intended
to
resume
her
old
honest
relations
with
a
reliable
and
experienced
bachelor
is
always
useful
to
a
young
and
moreover
the
attendant
hopeless
adorer
nourishes
her
hungry
egotism
as
nobody
else
can
thought
these
thoughts
clearly
and
callously
in
the
same
moment
as
mounting
the
next
flight
of
stairs
he
absolutely
trembled
with
sympathetic
anguish
for
concepcion
his
errand
was
an
impossible
one
he
feared
or
rather
he
hoped
that
the
very
look
on
his
face
might
betray
the
dreadful
news
to
that
undeceivable
intuition
which
women
were
supposed
to
possess
he
hesitated
on
the
stairs
he
recoiled
from
the
top
step
she
had
coquettishly
withdrawn
herself
into
the
room
he
had
the
slightest
idea
how
to
begin
yes
the
errand
was
an
impossible
one
and
yet
such
errands
had
to
be
performed
by
somebody
were
daily
being
performed
by
somebodies
then
he
had
the
idea
of
telephoning
privily
to
fetch
her
cousin
sara
he
would
open
by
remarking
casually
to
concepcion
i
say
can
i
use
your
telephone
a
minute
he
found
a
strange
concepcion
in
the
this
was
his
first
sight
of
carlos
smith
since
the
wedding
she
wore
a
dress
such
as
he
had
never
seen
on
her
a
and
for
lunch
it
could
be
called
neither
neat
nor
prim
but
it
was
voluptuous
her
complexion
had
bloomed
the
curves
of
her
face
were
softer
her
gestures
more
abandoned
her
gaze
full
of
a
bold
and
yet
shamed
her
dark
hair
looser
he
stood
close
to
her
he
stood
within
the
aura
of
her
recently
aroused
temperament
and
felt
it
he
thought
could
not
help
thinking
perhaps
she
bears
within
her
the
legacy
of
new
life
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
her
name
he
took
her
hot
hand
she
said
nothing
but
just
looked
at
him
he
then
said
jauntily
i
say
can
i
use
your
telephone
a
minute
fortunately
the
telephone
was
in
the
bedroom
he
went
farther
upstairs
and
shut
himself
in
the
bedroom
and
saw
naught
but
the
telephone
surrounded
by
the
mysterious
influences
of
inanimate
things
in
the
gay
crowded
room
is
that
you
trevise
it
speaking
hoape
yes
listen
i
at
concepcion
for
lunch
and
i
want
you
to
come
over
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
got
very
bad
news
indeed
the
worst
possible
carlos
has
been
killed
at
the
front
what
yes
awful
is
it
she
does
know
i
have
the
job
of
telling
her
now
that
the
words
had
been
spoken
in
concepcion
abode
the
reality
of
carlos
smith
death
seemed
more
horribly
convincing
than
before
and
speaker
of
the
words
felt
almost
as
guilty
as
though
he
himself
were
responsible
for
the
death
when
he
had
rung
off
he
stood
motionless
in
the
room
until
the
opening
of
the
door
startled
him
concepcion
appeared
if
you
done
corrupting
my
innocent
telephone
she
said
lunch
is
cooling
he
felt
a
murderer
at
the
she
might
have
been
a
genuine
south
american
nobody
could
be
less
like
christine
than
she
was
and
yet
in
those
instants
she
incomprehensibly
reminded
him
of
christine
then
she
started
to
talk
in
her
old
manner
of
a
professional
and
renowned
talker
listened
attentively
they
ate
it
was
astounding
that
he
could
eat
and
it
was
rather
surprising
that
she
did
not
cry
out
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
but
she
went
on
talking
evenly
and
she
made
him
recount
his
doings
he
related
the
conversation
at
the
club
and
especially
what
bob
the
retired
judge
had
said
about
equilibrium
on
the
western
front
she
did
not
want
to
hear
anything
as
to
the
funeral
we
have
champagne
she
said
suddenly
to
the
who
was
about
to
offer
some
red
wine
and
while
the
was
out
of
the
room
she
said
to
there
is
a
country
in
europe
where
champagne
is
not
a
symbol
and
we
must
conform
a
symbol
of
what
ah
the
unusual
and
what
is
there
unusual
he
almost
asked
but
did
not
ask
it
would
of
course
have
been
utterly
monstrous
to
put
such
a
question
knowing
what
he
knew
he
thought
i
not
a
bit
nearer
telling
her
than
i
was
when
i
came
after
the
had
poured
out
the
champagne
concepcion
picked
up
her
glass
and
absently
glanced
through
it
and
said
you
know
i
should
be
in
the
least
surprised
to
hear
that
carly
was
killed
out
there
i
should
really
in
amazement
ceased
to
eat
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
she
said
i
quite
serious
one
may
as
well
face
the
risks
does
of
course
they
all
heroes
there
are
millions
of
heroes
but
i
do
honestly
believe
that
my
carly
would
be
braver
than
anyone
by
the
way
did
i
ever
tell
you
he
was
considered
the
best
shot
in
cheshire
no
but
i
knew
answered
feebly
he
would
have
expected
her
to
be
a
little
condescending
towards
carlos
to
whom
in
brains
she
was
infinitely
superior
but
no
carlos
had
mastered
her
and
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
mastering
her
he
had
taught
her
in
three
weeks
more
than
she
had
learnt
on
two
continents
in
thirty
years
she
talked
of
him
precisely
as
any
wee
wifie
might
have
talked
of
the
and
she
called
him
carly
neither
of
them
had
touched
the
champagne
decided
that
he
would
postpone
any
attempt
to
tell
her
until
her
cousin
arrived
her
cousin
might
arrive
at
any
moment
now
while
the
presented
potatoes
concepcion
deliberately
ignored
her
and
said
dryly
to
i
ca
eat
any
more
i
think
i
ought
to
run
along
to
debenham
and
freebody
at
once
you
might
come
too
and
be
sure
to
bring
your
good
taste
with
you
he
was
alarmed
by
her
tone
debenham
and
freebody
what
for
to
order
mourning
of
course
to
have
it
ready
you
know
a
precaution
you
know
she
laughed
he
saw
that
she
was
becoming
hysterical
the
special
liability
of
the
for
whom
the
curtain
has
been
lifted
and
falls
exasperatingly
enragingly
too
soon
you
think
i
a
bit
hysterical
she
questioned
half
menacingly
and
stood
up
i
think
you
better
sit
down
to
begin
with
he
said
firmly
the
blushing
slightly
left
the
room
oh
all
right
concepcion
agreed
carelessly
and
sat
down
but
you
may
as
well
read
that
she
drew
a
telegram
from
the
low
neck
of
her
gown
and
carefully
unfolded
it
and
placed
it
in
front
of
him
it
was
a
war
office
telegram
announcing
that
carlos
had
been
killed
it
came
ten
minutes
before
you
she
said
why
did
you
tell
me
at
once
he
murmured
frightfully
shocked
he
was
actually
reproaching
her
she
stood
up
again
she
lived
her
breast
rose
and
fell
her
gown
had
the
same
voluptuousness
her
temperament
was
still
emanating
the
same
aura
she
was
the
same
new
concepcion
strange
and
yet
profoundly
known
to
him
but
ineffable
tragedy
had
marked
her
down
and
the
sight
of
her
parched
the
throat
she
said
could
besides
i
had
to
see
if
i
could
stand
it
because
i
got
to
stand
it
and
moreover
in
our
set
it
a
sacred
duty
to
be
original
she
snatched
the
telegram
tore
it
in
two
and
pushed
the
pieces
back
into
her
gown
wounded
name
she
murmured
bosom
as
a
bed
shall
lodge
thee
the
next
moment
she
fell
to
the
floor
at
full
length
on
her
back
sprang
to
her
kneeling
on
her
rich
outspread
gown
and
tried
to
lift
her
no
no
she
protested
faintly
dreamily
with
a
feeble
frown
on
her
pale
forehead
let
me
lie
equilibrium
has
been
established
on
the
western
front
this
was
her
greatest
chapter
rendezvous
when
the
italian
woman
having
recognised
him
with
a
discreet
smile
introduced
into
the
of
the
cork
street
flat
he
saw
christine
lying
on
the
sofa
by
the
fire
she
too
was
in
a
she
said
do
not
be
vexed
i
have
my
migraine
am
good
for
nothing
but
i
gave
the
order
that
thou
shouldst
be
admitted
she
lifted
her
arms
and
the
long
sleeves
fell
away
bent
down
and
kissed
her
she
joined
her
hands
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
with
this
leverage
raised
her
whole
body
for
an
instant
like
a
child
smiling
then
dropped
back
with
a
fatigued
sigh
also
like
a
child
he
found
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
she
was
laid
aside
it
was
providential
it
set
him
right
with
himself
for
to
put
the
thing
crudely
he
had
left
the
tragic
concepcion
to
come
to
christine
a
woman
picked
up
in
a
promenade
true
sara
trevise
had
agreed
with
him
that
he
could
accomplish
no
good
by
staying
at
concepcion
concepcion
had
withdrawn
from
the
vision
of
men
true
it
could
make
no
difference
to
concepcion
whether
he
retired
to
his
flat
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
saw
no
one
or
whether
having
changed
his
ceremonious
clothes
there
he
went
out
again
on
his
own
affairs
true
he
had
promised
christine
to
see
her
that
afternoon
and
a
promise
was
a
promise
and
christine
was
a
woman
who
had
behaved
well
to
him
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
send
her
an
excuse
since
he
did
not
know
her
surname
these
apparently
excellent
arguments
were
specious
and
worthless
he
would
anyhow
have
gone
to
christine
the
call
was
imperious
within
him
and
took
no
heed
of
grief
nor
propriety
nor
the
secret
decencies
of
sympathy
the
primitive
man
in
him
would
have
gone
to
christine
he
sat
down
with
a
profound
and
exquisite
relief
the
entrance
to
the
house
was
nearly
opposite
the
entrance
to
a
prim
but
fashionable
and
expensive
hotel
to
ring
and
ring
the
right
bell
and
wait
at
christine
door
almost
under
the
eyes
of
the
hotel
was
an
ordeal
the
fat
and
untidy
italian
had
opened
the
door
and
shut
it
again
quick
he
was
in
another
world
saved
safe
on
the
dark
staircase
the
image
of
concepcion
with
her
temperament
roused
and
condemned
to
everlasting
hunger
the
unconquerable
concepcion
blasted
in
an
instant
of
destiny
this
image
faded
she
would
she
ought
to
and
now
he
was
in
christine
warm
room
and
christine
temporary
invalid
reclined
before
his
eyes
the
lights
were
turned
on
the
blinds
drawn
the
stove
replenished
the
fire
replenished
he
was
enclosed
with
christine
in
a
little
world
with
no
law
and
no
conventions
except
its
own
and
no
shames
nor
pretences
he
was
as
it
were
in
the
east
and
the
immanence
of
a
third
person
the
italian
accepting
naturally
and
completely
the
code
of
the
little
world
only
added
to
the
charm
the
italian
was
like
a
slave
from
whom
it
is
necessary
to
hide
nothing
and
never
to
blush
a
stuffy
little
world
with
a
perceptible
odour
ordinarily
he
had
the
common
insular
appetite
for
ventilation
but
now
stuffiness
appealed
to
him
he
scented
it
almost
voluptuously
the
ugliness
of
the
wallpaper
of
the
furniture
of
everything
in
the
room
was
naught
christine
profession
was
naught
who
could
positively
say
that
her
profession
was
on
her
face
in
her
gestures
in
her
talk
admirable
as
was
his
knowledge
of
french
it
was
not
enough
to
enable
him
to
criticise
her
speech
her
gestures
were
delightful
her
face
her
face
was
soft
her
puckered
brow
was
touching
in
its
ingenuousness
she
had
a
kind
and
a
trustful
eye
it
was
a
lewd
eye
indicative
of
her
incomparable
endowment
but
had
he
not
encountered
the
lewd
eye
in
the
very
arcana
of
the
respectability
of
the
world
outside
on
the
sofa
open
and
leaves
downward
lay
a
book
with
a
glistening
coloured
cover
entitled
it
was
the
seventh
volume
of
an
interminable
romance
which
for
years
had
had
a
tremendous
vogue
among
the
concierges
the
workgirls
the
clerks
and
the
of
paris
an
unreadable
affair
not
even
indecent
which
nevertheless
had
enchanted
a
whole
generation
to
be
able
to
enjoy
it
was
an
absolute
demonstration
of
lack
of
taste
but
did
not
some
of
his
best
friends
enjoy
books
no
better
and
could
he
not
any
day
in
any
see
martyred
books
dropped
open
and
leaves
downwards
in
a
manner
to
raise
the
gorge
of
a
person
of
any
bookish
sensibility
thou
wilt
play
for
me
she
suggested
but
the
headache
it
will
do
me
good
i
adore
music
such
music
as
thou
playest
he
was
flattered
the
draped
piano
was
close
to
him
stretching
out
his
hand
he
took
a
little
pile
of
music
from
the
top
of
it
but
you
play
then
he
exclaimed
pleased
no
no
i
tap
only
and
very
little
he
glanced
through
the
pieces
of
music
they
were
all
without
exception
waltzes
by
the
once
popular
of
paris
and
vienna
including
several
by
the
king
of
kings
berger
he
seated
himself
at
the
piano
and
opened
the
first
waltz
that
came
oh
i
adore
the
waltzes
of
berger
she
murmured
there
is
only
he
you
do
think
so
he
said
he
had
never
heard
any
of
this
music
then
he
played
every
piece
for
her
he
tried
to
see
what
it
was
in
this
music
that
so
pleased
the
simple
and
he
saw
it
or
he
thought
he
saw
it
he
abandoned
himself
to
the
music
yielding
to
it
accepting
its
ideals
interpreting
it
as
though
it
moved
him
until
in
the
end
it
did
produce
in
him
a
sort
of
factitious
emotion
after
all
it
was
no
worse
than
much
of
the
music
he
was
forced
to
hear
in
very
refined
circles
she
said
ravished
you
decipher
music
like
an
angel
and
hummed
a
fragment
of
the
waltz
from
which
he
had
played
for
her
two
evenings
earlier
he
glanced
round
sharply
had
she
then
real
taste
it
is
like
that
is
it
she
questioned
and
hummed
it
again
flattered
by
the
look
on
his
face
while
at
her
invitation
he
repeated
the
waltz
on
the
piano
whose
strings
might
have
been
made
of
zinc
he
heard
a
ring
at
the
outer
door
and
then
the
muffled
sound
of
a
colloquy
between
a
male
voice
and
the
voice
of
the
italian
of
course
he
admitted
philosophically
she
has
other
clients
already
such
a
woman
was
bound
to
have
other
clients
he
felt
no
jealousy
nor
even
discomfort
from
the
fact
that
she
lent
herself
to
any
male
with
sufficient
money
and
a
respectable
appearance
the
colloquy
expired
ring
please
she
requested
after
thanking
him
he
hoped
that
she
was
not
going
to
interrogate
the
italian
in
his
presence
surely
she
would
be
incapable
of
such
clumsiness
still
women
without
imagination
and
the
majority
of
women
were
without
imagination
did
do
the
most
astounding
things
there
was
no
immediate
answer
to
the
bell
but
in
a
few
minutes
the
italian
entered
with
a
christine
sat
up
i
will
pour
the
tea
said
she
and
to
the
italian
marthe
where
is
the
evening
paper
and
when
marthe
returned
with
a
newspaper
damp
from
the
press
christine
said
to
monsieur
not
a
word
of
curiosity
as
to
the
unknown
visitor
was
amply
confirmed
in
his
original
opinion
of
christine
she
was
one
in
a
hundred
to
provide
the
evening
paper
it
was
nothing
but
it
was
enormous
sit
by
my
side
she
said
she
made
just
a
little
space
for
him
on
the
sofa
barely
enough
so
that
he
had
to
squeeze
in
the
afternoon
tea
was
correct
save
for
the
extraordinary
thickness
of
the
but
said
to
himself
that
the
french
did
not
understand
and
the
italians
still
less
to
compensate
for
the
defects
of
the
there
was
a
box
of
fine
chocolates
i
perfect
my
english
she
said
tea
was
finished
they
were
smoking
the
spread
between
them
over
the
she
articulated
with
a
strong
french
accent
the
words
of
some

must
be
celebrated
there
was
a
portrait
of
the
illustrious
concepcion

with
some
sympathetic
remarks
about
her

conceived
very
differently

answered
vaguely
i
do
not
like
too
much
these
society
women
they
are
worse
than
us
and
they
cost
you
more
ah
if
the
truth
were
known
christine
spoke
with
a
queer
restrained
surprising
bitterness
then
she
added
softly
relenting
however
it
is
sad
for
her
who
was
he
this
monsieur
replied
that
he
was
nobody
in
particular
so
far
as
his
knowledge
went
ah
one
of
those
who
are
husbands
of
their
wives
said
christine
acidly
the
disturbing
intuition
of
women
a
little
later
he
said
that
he
must
depart
but
why
i
feel
better
i
have
a
committee
a
committee
it
is
a
work
of
charity
for
the
french
wounded
ah
in
that
case
but
beloved
yes
she
lowered
her
voice
how
dost
thou
call
thyself
gilbert
thou
knowest
i
have
a
fancy
for
thee
her
tone
was
delicious
its
sincerity
absolutely
convincing
too
amiable
no
no
it
is
true
say
return
return
after
thy
committee
take
me
out
to
dinner
some
gentle
little
restaurant
discreet
there
must
be
many
of
them
in
a
city
like
london
it
is
a
city
so
romantic
oh
the
little
corners
of
london
but
of
course
i
should
be
enchanted
well
then
he
was
standing
she
raised
her
smiling
seductive
face
she
was
young
younger
than
concepcion
less
battered
by
the
world
contacts
than
concepcion
she
had
the
inexpressible
virtue
and
power
of
youth
he
was
nearing
fifty
and
she
perhaps
half
his
age
had
confessed
his
charm
and
say
my
gilbert
bring
me
a
few
flowers
i
have
not
been
able
to
go
out
something
very
simple
i
detest
that
one
should
squander
money
on
flowers
for
me
then
said
he
and
you
will
be
ready
i
shall
be
very
exact
thou
wilt
tell
me
all
that
concerns
thy
committee
that
interests
me
the
english
are
extraordinary
chapter
in

within
the
hotel
the
glowing
gold
hall
whose
lincrusta
walton
panels
dated
it
was
nearly
empty
of
the
hundred
small
round
tables
only
one
was
occupied
a
bald
head
and
a
large
green
hat
were
almost
meeting
over
the
top
of
this
table
but
there
was
nothing
on
it
except
an
ashtray
a
waiter
wandered
about
amid
the
thick
plushy
silence
and
the
stagnant
pools
of
electric
light
meditating
upon
the
curse
which
had
befallen
the
world
of
hotels
the
red
lips
beneath
the
green
hat
discernibly
moved
but
no
faintest
murmur
therefrom
reached
the
entrance
the
hot
still
place
seemed
to
be
enchanted
the
sight
of
the
hotel
recessed
on
the
left
reminded
of
christine
desire
forty
thousand
skilled
women
had
been
put
out
of
work
in
england
because
luxury
was
scared
by
the
sudden
vista
of
war
but
the
girl
entrenched
in
her
mahogany
bower
was
still
earning
some
sort
of
a
livelihood
in
a
moment
wakened
out
of
her
terrible
boredom
into
an
alert
smile
she
had
sold
to
a
bunch
of
expensive
chrysanthemums
whose
yellow
petals
were
like
long
curly
locks
thoughtless
he
had
meant
to
have
the
flowers
delivered
at
once
to
christine
flat
it
would
not
do
it
would
be
indiscreet
and
somehow
in
the
absence
of
braiding
it
would
be
equally
indiscreet
to
have
them
delivered
at
his
own
flat
i
shall
be
leaving
the
hotel
in
about
an
hour
i
take
them
away
myself
then
he
said
and
inquired
for
the
headquarters
of
the
lechford
french
hospitals
committee
committee
repeated
the
girl
vaguely
i
expect
the
onyx
hall
what
you
want
she
pointed
up
a
corridor
and
gave
change
discovered
the
onyx
hall
which
had
its
own
entrance
from
the
street
and
which
in
other
days
had
been
a
café
lounge
the
precious
pavement
was
now
half
hidden
by
wooden
trestles
wooden
cubicles
and
cheap
chairs
temporary
flexes
brought
down
electric
light
from
a
stained
glass
dome
to
illuminate
and
and
piles
of
letters
notices
in
french
and
flemish
were
suspended
from
the
ornate
onyx
pilasters
old
countrywomen
and
children
in
rough
foreign
clothes
smart
officers
in
strange
uniforms
privates
in
shabby
blue
gentlemen
in
morning
coats
and
spats
and
untidy
englishwomen
with
eyes
romantic
hard
or
wistful
were
mixed
together
in
the
onyx
hall
where
there
was
no
enchantment
and
little
order
save
that
good
french
seemed
to
be
regularly
spoken
on
one
side
of
the
trestles
and
regularly
assassinated
on
the
other
mystified
caught
the
grey
eye
of
a
youngish
woman
with
a
tired
and
fretful
expression
and
you
she
inquired
perfunctorily
he
demanded
with
hesitation
is
this
the
lechford
committee
the
what
committee
the
lechford
committee
headquarters
he
thought
she
might
be
rather
an
attractive
little
thing
at
say
an
evening
party
she
gave
him
a
sardonic
look
and
answered
not
rudely
but
with
large
tolerance
ca
you
read
by
means
of
gesture
scarcely
perceptible
she
directed
his
attention
to
an
immense
linen
sign
stretched
across
the
back
of
the
big
room
and
he
saw
that
he
was
in
the
of
some
belgian
committee
so
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
he
apologised
i
suppose
you
happen
to
know
where
the
lechford
committee
sits
never
heard
of
it
said
she
with
cheerful
disdain
then
she
smiled
and
he
smiled
you
know
the
hotel
simply
hums
with
committees
but
this
is
the
biggest
by
a
long
way
they
ca
let
their
rooms
so
it
costs
them
nothing
to
lend
them
for
patriotic
purposes
he
liked
the
chit
presently
with
a
he
was
ascending
in
a
lift
through
storey
after
storey
of
silent
carpeted
desert
light
alternated
with
darkness
winking
like
a
succession
of
days
and
nights
as
seen
by
a
god
the
infant
showed
him
into
a
private
parlour
furnished
and
decorated
in
almost
precisely
the
same
taste
as
where
a
number
of
men
and
women
sat
close
together
at
a
long
deal
table
whose
pale
classic
simplicity
clashed
with
the
rest
of
the
apartment
a
thin
dark
man
of
austere
visage
bowed
to
him
from
the
head
of
the
table
somebody
else
indicated
a
chair
which
with
a
hideous
noisy
scraping
over
the
bare
floor
he
modestly
insinuated
between
two
occupied
chairs
a
third
person
offered
a
typewritten
sheet
containing
the
agenda
of
the
meeting
a
blonde
girl
was
reading
in
earnest
timid
tones
the
minutes
of
the
previous
meeting
the
affair
had
just
begun
as
soon
as
the
minutes
had
been
passed
the
austere
chairman
turned
and
said
evenly
i
am
sure
i
am
expressing
the
feelings
of
the
committee
in
welcoming
among
us
hoape
who
has
so
kindly
consented
to
join
us
and
give
us
the
benefit
of
his
help
and
advice
in
our
labours
sympathetic
murmurs
converged
upon
from
the
four
sides
of
the
table
and
nervously
murmured
a
few
incomprehensible
words
feeling
both
foolish
and
pleased
he
had
never
sat
on
a
committee
and
as
his
troubled
him
more
and
more
daily
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
start
work
which
might
placate
it
indeed
he
had
seized
upon
the
request
to
join
the
committee
as
a
swimmer
in
difficulties
clasps
the
gunwale
of
a
dinghy
a
man
who
kept
his
gaze
steadily
on
the
table
cleared
his
throat
and
said
the
matter
is
not
in
order
chairman
but
i
am
sure
i
am
expressing
the
feelings
of
the
committee
in
proposing
a
vote
of
condolence
to
yourself
on
the
terrible
loss
which
you
have
sustained
in
the
death
of
your
son
at
the
front
i
beg
to
second
that
said
a
lady
quickly
our
chairman
has
given
his
only
son
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
appeal
for
help
there
were
hear
hears
and
more
sympathetic
murmurs
the
proposer
with
his
gaze
still
steadily
fixed
on
the
table
said
i
beg
to
put
the
resolution
to
the
meeting
yes
said
the
chairman
with
calm
in
the
course
of
his
acknowledgment
and
if
i
had
ten
sons
i
would
willingly
give
them
all
for
the
cause
and
his
firm
hard
glance
appeared
to
challenge
any
member
of
the
committee
to
assert
that
this
profession
of
parental
and
patriotic
generosity
of
heart
was
not
utterly
sincere
however
nobody
had
the
air
of
doubting
that
if
the
chairman
had
had
ten
sons
or
as
many
sons
as
solomon
he
would
have
sacrificed
them
all
with
the
most
admirable
and
eager
heroism
the
agenda
was
opened
had
little
but
newspaper
knowledge
of
the
enterprises
of
the
committee
and
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
waste
the
time
of
so
numerous
a
company
in
enlightening
him
the
custom
evidently
was
that
new
members
should
pick
up
the
threads
as
they
went
along
honestly
tried
to
do
so
but
he
was
preoccupied
with
the
personalities
of
the
committee
he
soon
saw
that
the
whole
body
was
effectively
divided
into
two
classes
the
chairmen
of
the
various
and
the
rest
few
members
were
interested
in
any
particular
subject
those
who
were
not
interested
either
stared
at
the
walls
or
at
the
agenda
paper
or
laboriously
drew
intricate
and
meaningless
designs
on
the
agenda
paper
or
folded
up
the
agenda
paper
into
fantastic
shapes
until
when
someone
in
authority
brought
out
the
formula
i
think
the
view
of
the
committee
will
be
a
resolution
was
put
and
the
issue
settled
by
the
mechanical
raising
of
hands
on
the
fulcrum
of
the
elbow
and
at
each
raising
of
hands
everybody
felt
that
something
positive
had
indeed
been
accomplished
the
new
member
was
a
little
discouraged
he
had
the
illusion
that
the
two
hospitals
run
in
france
for
french
soldiers
by
the
lechford
committee
were
an
illusion
that
they
did
not
really
exist
that
the
committee
was
discussing
an
abstraction
nevertheless
each
problem
as
it
was
presented
the
drains
postponed
the
repairs
to
the
the
ordering
of
a
new
apparatus
the
dilatoriness
of
a
french
minister
in
dealing
with
correspondence
the
cost
per
day
per
patient
the
relations
with
the
french
civil
authorities
and
the
french
military
authorities
the
appointment
of
a
new
matron
who
could
keep
the
peace
with
the
senior
doctor
and
the
great
principle
involved
in
deducting
five
francs
fifty
centimes
for
excess
luggage
from
a
nurse
account
for
travelling
expenses
each
problem
helped
to
demonstrate
that
the
hospitals
did
exist
and
that
men
and
women
were
toiling
therein
and
that
french
soldiers
in
grave
need
were
being
magnificently
cared
for
and
even
saved
from
death
and
it
was
plain
too
that
none
of
these
excellent
things
could
have
come
to
pass
or
could
continue
to
occur
if
the
committee
did
not
regularly
sit
round
the
table
and
at
short
intervals
perform
the
rite
of
raising
hands
attention
wandered
he
could
not
keep
his
mind
off
the
thought
that
he
should
soon
be
seeing
christine
again
sitting
at
the
table
with
a
mien
of
intelligent
interest
he
had
a
waking
dream
of
christine
he
saw
her
just
as
she
was
ingenuous
and
ignorant
if
you
like
except
that
she
was
pure
her
purity
though
had
not
cooled
her
temperament
and
thus
she
combined
in
herself
the
characteristics
of
at
least
two
different
women
both
of
whom
were
necessary
to
his
happiness
and
she
was
his
wife
and
they
lived
in
a
roomy
house
in
hyde
park
gardens
and
the
war
was
over
and
she
adored
him
and
he
was
passionately
fond
of
her
and
she
was
always
having
children
she
enjoyed
having
children
she
demanded
children
she
had
a
child
every
year
and
there
was
never
any
trouble
and
he
never
admired
her
more
poignantly
than
at
the
periods
just
before
his
children
were
born
when
she
had
the
vast
exquisitely
swelling
figure
of
the
french
renaissance
virgin
in
marble
that
stood
on
a
console
in
his
at
the
albany
such
was
dream
as
he
assisted
in
the
control
of
the
lechford
hospitals
emerging
from
it
he
looked
along
the
table
quite
half
the
members
were
dreaming
too
and
he
wondered
what
thoughts
were
moving
secretly
within
them
but
the
chairman
was
not
dreaming
he
never
loosed
his
grasp
of
the
matter
in
hand
nor
did
the
earnest
young
blonde
by
the
chairman
side
who
took
down
in
stenography
the
decisions
of
the
committee
chapter
queen
then
lady
queenie
paulle
entered
rather
hurriedly
filling
the
room
with
a
distinguished
scent
all
the
men
rose
in
haste
and
there
was
a
frightful
scraping
of
on
the
floor
lady
queenie
cheerfully
apologised
for
being
late
and
begging
no
one
to
disturb
himself
took
a
modest
place
between
the
chairman
and
the
secretary
and
a
little
behind
them
lady
queenie
obviously
had
what
is
called
race
the
renown
of
her
family
went
back
far
far
beyond
its
special
victorian
vogue
which
had
transformed
an
earldom
into
a
marquisate
and
which
incidentally
was
responsible
for
the
new
family
christian
name
that
queenie
herself
bore
she
was
young
tall
slim
and
pale
and
dressed
with
the
utmost
smartness
in
black
her
having
gloriously
lost
his
life
in
september
she
nodded
to
the
secretary
who
blushed
with
pleasure
and
she
nodded
to
several
members
including
being
accustomed
to
publicity
and
to
seeing
herself
nearly
every
week
in
either
or
she
was
perfectly
at
ease
in
the
room
and
the
fact
that
nearly
the
whole
company
turned
to
her
as
plants
to
the
sun
did
not
in
the
least
disturb
her
the
attention
which
she
received
was
her
due
for
she
had
few
rivals
as
a
she
was
connected
with
the
queen
work
for
women
fund
queen
mary
needlework
guild
the
three
arts
fund
the
emergency
corps
and
many
minor
organisations
she
had
joined
a
women
suffrage
society
because
such
societies
were
being
utilised
by
the
government
she
had
had
ten
lessons
in
first
aid
in
ten
days
had
donned
the
red
cross
and
gone
to
france
with
two
and
a
staff
and
a
french
maid
in
order
to
help
in
the
great
national
work
of
nursing
wounded
heroes
and
she
might
still
have
been
in
france
had
not
an
unsympathetic
and
audacious
colonel
of
the
insisted
on
her
being
shipped
back
to
england
she
had
done
practically
everything
that
a
patriotic
girl
could
do
for
the
war
except
perhaps
join
a
voluntary
aid
detachment
and
wash
dishes
and
scrub
floors
for
fifteen
hours
a
day
and
thirteen
and
a
half
days
a
fortnight
it
was
from
her
mother
that
she
had
inherited
the
passion
for
public
service
the
marchioness
of
lechford
had
been
the
cause
of
more
philanthropic
work
in
others
than
any
woman
in
the
whole
history
of
philanthropy
lady
lechford
had
said
let
there
be
lechford
hospitals
in
france
and
lo
there
were
lechford
hospitals
in
france
when
troublesome
complications
arose
lady
lechford
had
with
true
surrendered
the
establishments
to
a
thoroughly
competent
committee
and
while
retaining
a
seat
on
the
committee
for
herself
and
another
for
queenie
had
curved
tirelessly
away
to
the
inauguration
of
fresh
and
more
exciting
schemes
mamma
was
very
sorry
she
could
come
this
afternoon
said
lady
queenie
addressing
the
chairman
the
formula
of
those
with
authority
in
deciding
now
became
i
do
know
exactly
what
lady
lechford
view
is
but
i
venture
to
think
then
suddenly
the
demeanour
of
every
member
of
the
committee
was
quickened
everybody
listened
intently
to
everything
that
was
said
a
couple
of
members
would
speak
together
and
the
manufacture
of
paper
ships
chains
and
flowers
ceased
it
was
as
though
a
tonic
had
been
mysteriously
administered
to
each
individual
in
the
enervating
room
the
cause
of
the
change
was
a
recommendation
from
the
hospitals
management
that
it
be
an
instruction
to
the
new
matron
of
the
smaller
hospital
to
forbid
any
nurse
and
any
doctor
to
go
out
alone
together
in
the
evening
scandal
was
insinuated
nothing
really
wrong
but
a
bad
impression
produced
upon
the
civilians
of
the
tiny
town
who
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
the
holy
innocence
which
underlies
the
superficial
license
of
manners
the
personal
characters
and
strange
idiosyncrasies
of
every
doctor
and
every
nurse
were
discussed
broad
principles
of
conduct
were
enunciated
together
with
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
those
opposite
poles
discipline
and
freedom
the
argument
continually
expanded
branching
forth
like
the
timber
of
a
great
from
the
trunk
and
the
minds
of
the
committee
ran
about
the
tree
like
monkeys
the
interest
was
endless
a
quiet
delegate
who
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
tiny
town
completely
blasted
one
part
of
the
argument
by
asserting
that
the
hospital
bore
a
blameless
reputation
among
the
citizens
but
new
arguments
were
instantly
constructed
by
the
adherents
of
the
idea
of
discipline
the
committee
had
plainly
split
into
two
even
parties
began
to
resent
the
harshness
of
the
disciplinarians
i
think
we
should
remember
he
said
in
his
modest
voice
i
think
we
should
remember
that
we
are
dealing
with
adult
men
and
women
the
libertarians
at
once
took
him
for
their
own
the
disciplinarians
gave
him
to
understand
with
their
eyes
that
it
might
have
been
better
if
he
as
a
new
member
attending
his
first
meeting
had
kept
silence
the
discussion
was
inflamed
one
or
two
people
glanced
surreptitiously
at
their
watches
the
hour
had
long
passed
six
thirty
grew
anxious
about
his
rendezvous
with
christine
he
had
enjoined
exactitude
upon
christine
but
the
main
body
of
the
excited
and
happy
committee
had
no
thought
of
the
flight
of
time
the
amusements
of
the
tiny
town
came
up
for
review
as
a
fact
there
was
only
one
amusement
the
cinema
the
whole
town
went
to
the
cinema
cinemas
were
always
darkened
human
nature
was
human
nature
had
an
extraordinarily
realistic
vision
of
the
hospital
staff
slaving
through
its
long
and
heavy
day
and
its
everlasting
week
and
preparing
in
sections
to
amuse
itself
on
certain
evenings
and
thinking
with
pleasant
anticipation
of
the
ecstasies
of
the
cinema
and
pathetically
unsuspicious
that
its
fate
was
being
decided
by
a
council
of
omnipotent
deities
in
the
heaven
of
a
london
hotel
mamma
has
never
mentioned
the
subject
to
me
said
lady
queenie
in
response
to
a
question
looking
at
her
rich
muff
this
is
a
question
of
principle
said
somebody
sharply
implying
that
at
last
individual
consciences
were
involved
and
that
the
opinions
of
the
marchioness
of
lechford
had
ceased
to
weigh
i
afraid
it
getting
late
said
the
impassive
chairman
we
must
come
to
some
decision
in
the
voting
lady
queenie
after
hesitation
raised
her
hand
with
the
disciplinarians
by
one
vote
the
libertarians
were
defeated
and
the
dalliance
of
the
hospital
staff
in
leisure
hours
received
a
severe
check
she
of
course
breathed
a
little
woman
in
the
chair
next
but
one
to
gazing
inimically
at
the
lax
mouth
and
cynical
eyes
of
lady
queenie
who
for
four
years
had
been
the
subject
of
universal
whispering
and
some
shouting
and
one
or
two
ferocious
battles
in
london
scraped
people
rose
here
and
there
to
go
as
they
rise
in
a
music
hall
after
the
scottish
comedian
has
retired
bowing
from
his
final
encore
they
protested
urgent
appointments
elsewhere
the
chairman
remarked
that
other
important
decisions
yet
remained
to
be
taken
but
his
voice
had
no
insistence
because
he
had
already
settled
the
decisions
in
his
own
mind
seized
the
occasion
to
depart
hoape
the
chairman
detained
him
a
moment
the
committee
hope
you
will
allow
yourself
to
be
nominated
to
the
accounts
we
understand
that
you
are
by
way
of
being
an
expert
the
meets
on
wednesday
mornings
at
eleven
does
it
sir
charles
said
sir
charles
oh
somewhat
surprised
to
learn
of
his
expertise
in
accountancy
consented
to
the
suggestion
which
renewed
his
resolution
impaired
somewhat
by
the
experience
of
the
meeting
to
be
of
service
in
the
world
you
will
receive
the
notice
of
course
said
the
chairman
down
below
just
as
was
getting
away
with
chrysanthemums
in
their
tissue
paper
lady
queenie
darted
out
of
the
lift
opposite
it
was
she
who
at
concepcion
instigation
had
had
him
put
in
the
committee
i
say
queen
he
said
with
a
casual
air
on
account
of
the
flowers
who
been
telling
i
know
about
accounts
i
did
why
why
she
said
maliciously
do
you
keep
an
account
of
every
penny
you
spend
it
was
true
here
was
a
fair
example
of
her
sardonic
and
unscrupulous
humour
a
humour
not
of
words
but
of
acts
simply
tossed
his
head
aware
of
the
futility
of
expostulation
she
went
on
in
a
different
tone
you
were
the
first
to
see
connie
yes
he
said
sadly
she
has
lain
in
my
arms
all
afternoon
lady
queenie
burst
out
her
voice
liquid
and
now
i
going
straight
back
to
her
she
looked
at
him
with
the
strangest
triumphant
expression
then
her
large
equivocal
blue
eyes
fell
from
his
face
to
the
flowers
and
their
expression
simultaneously
altered
to
disdainful
amusement
full
of
mischievous
implications
she
ran
off
without
another
word
the
glazed
entrance
doors
revolved
and
he
saw
her
nip
into
an
electric
brougham
which
before
he
had
time
to
button
his
overcoat
vanished
like
an
apparition
in
the
rainy
mist
chapter
evening
out
he
found
christine
exactly
as
he
had
left
her
in
the
same
and
the
same
posture
and
on
the
same
sofa
but
a
small
table
had
been
put
by
the
sofa
and
on
this
table
was
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
in
a
saucer
and
a
pen
she
was
studying
some
kind
of
official
form
the
pucker
between
the
eyes
was
very
marked
already
she
exclaimed
as
if
amazed
but
there
is
not
a
clock
that
goes
and
i
had
not
the
least
idea
of
the
hour
besides
i
was
splitting
my
head
to
fill
up
this
form
such
was
her
notion
of
being
exact
he
had
abandoned
an
important
meeting
of
a
committee
which
was
doing
untold
mercies
to
her
compatriots
in
order
to
keep
his
appointment
with
her
and
she
whose
professional
business
it
was
that
evening
to
charm
him
and
harmonise
with
him
had
merely
flouted
the
appointment
nevertheless
her
gestures
and
smile
as
she
rose
and
came
towards
him
were
so
utterly
exquisite
that
immediately
he
also
flouted
the
appointment
what
after
all
could
it
matter
whether
they
dined
at
eight
nine
or
even
ten
thou
wilt
pardon
me
monster
she
murmured
kissing
him
no
woman
had
ever
put
her
chin
up
to
his
as
she
did
nor
with
a
glance
expressed
so
unreserved
a
surrender
to
his
masculinity
she
went
on
twining
languishingly
round
him
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ought
to
go
out
i
am
yet
far
from
it
is
perhaps
imprudent
absurd
he
protested
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
not
dining
with
him
he
knew
too
well
the
desolation
of
a
solitary
dinner
absurd
we
go
in
a
taxi
the
restaurant
is
warm
we
return
in
a
taxi
to
please
thee
then
what
is
that
form
it
is
for
the
telephone
thou
understandest
how
it
is
necessary
that
i
have
the
telephone
me
but
i
comprehend
nothing
of
this
form
she
passed
him
the
form
she
had
written
her
name
in
the
space
allotted
christine
dubois
a
fair
calligraphy
but
what
a
name
the
french
equivalent
of
smith
nothing
could
be
less
distinguished
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
concepcion
name
also
was
smith
i
will
fill
it
up
for
you
it
is
quite
simple
it
is
possible
that
it
is
simple
when
one
is
english
but
english
that
is
as
if
to
say
chinese
everything
contrary
here
is
a
pen
no
i
have
my
he
hated
a
cheap
pen
and
still
more
a
penny
bottle
of
ink
but
somehow
this
particular
penny
bottle
of
ink
seemed
touching
in
its
simple
ugliness
she
was
eminently
teachable
he
would
teach
her
his
own
attitude
towards
penny
bottles
of
ink
of
course
she
would
need
the
telephone
that
could
not
be
denied
as
christine
was
signing
the
form
marthe
entered
with
the
chrysanthemums
which
he
had
handed
over
to
her
she
had
arranged
them
in
a
horrible
blue
glass
vase
cheaply
gilded
and
while
marthe
was
putting
the
vase
on
the
small
table
there
was
a
ring
at
the
outer
door
marthe
hurried
off
christine
said
kissing
him
again
tenderly
thou
art
a
squanderer
fine
for
me
to
tell
thee
not
to
buy
costly
flowers
thou
has
spent
at
least
ten
shillings
for
these
with
ten
shillings
no
no
he
interrupted
her
five
it
was
a
fib
he
had
paid
half
a
guinea
for
the
few
flowers
but
he
could
not
confess
it
they
could
hear
a
powerful
voice
indistinctly
booming
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
two
callers
on
one
afternoon
reflected
and
yet
she
had
told
him
she
went
out
for
the
first
time
only
the
day
before
yesterday
he
scarcely
liked
it
but
his
reason
rescued
him
from
the
puerility
of
a
grievance
against
her
on
this
account
and
why
not
she
is
bound
to
be
a
marked
success
marthe
returned
to
the
and
shut
the
door
madame
she
began
slightly
agitated
speak
then
christine
urged
catching
her
agitation
it
is
the
police
had
a
shock
he
knew
many
of
the
policemen
who
lurked
in
the
dark
doorways
of
piccadilly
at
night
had
little
friendly
talks
with
them
held
them
for
excellent
fellows
but
a
policeman
invading
the
flat
of
a
courtesan
and
himself
in
the
flat
seemed
a
different
being
from
the
honest
stalwarts
who
threw
the
beams
of
lanterns
on
the
of
jewellers
shops
christine
steeled
herself
to
meet
the
crisis
with
she
pointedly
did
not
appeal
to
the
male
well
what
is
it
that
he
wants
he
talks
of
the
chimney
it
appears
this
morning
there
was
a
chimney
on
fire
but
since
we
burn
only
anthracite
and
gas
he
knows
name
there
was
a
pause
christine
asked
sharply
and
mysteriously
how
much
do
you
think
if
madame
gave
five
pounds
having
regard
to
the
of
the
quarter
christine
rushed
into
the
bedroom
and
came
back
with
a
note
here
chuck
that
at
him
politely
tell
him
we
are
very
sorry
yes
madame
but
he
never
take
it
you
ca
treat
the
london
police
like
that
could
not
help
expostulating
as
soon
as
marthe
had
gone
he
feared
some
trouble
my
poor
friend
christine
replied
patronisingly
thou
art
not
up
in
these
things
marthe
knows
her
affair
a
woman
very
experienced
in
london
he
will
take
it
thy
policeman
and
if
i
do
not
deceive
myself
no
more
chimneys
will
burn
for
about
a
year
ah
the
police
do
not
wipe
their
noses
with
broken
bottles
she
meant
that
the
police
knew
their
way
about
i
no
more
than
they
i
do
not
wipe
my
nose
with
broken
bottles
she
was
moved
indignant
stoutly
defensive
grew
moreover
her
slang
disturbed
him
it
was
the
first
slang
he
had
heard
her
use
and
in
using
it
her
voice
had
roughened
but
he
remembered
that
concepcion
also
used
slang
and
advanced
slang
upon
occasion
the
booming
ceased
a
door
closed
marthe
returned
once
more
well
he
is
gone
he
was
very
nice
madame
i
told
him
about
madame
that
madame
was
very
discreet
marthe
finished
in
a
murmur
so
much
the
better
now
help
me
to
dress
quick
quick
monsieur
will
be
impatient
was
ashamed
of
the
innocence
he
had
displayed
and
ashamed
too
of
the
whole
metropolitan
police
force
admirable
though
it
was
in
stopping
traffic
for
a
perambulator
to
cross
the
road
five
pounds
these
ladies
were
bled
five
pounds
wanted
earning
it
was
a
good
sign
though
that
she
had
not
so
far
asked
him
to
contribute
and
he
felt
sure
that
she
would
not
come
in
then
poltroon
she
cooed
softly
and
encouragingly
from
the
bedroom
where
marthe
was
busy
with
her
the
door
between
the
bedroom
and
the
was
open
humming
obeyed
the
invitation
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
between
two
heaps
of
clothes
christine
was
very
gay
she
was
like
a
child
she
had
apparently
quite
forgotten
her
migraine
and
also
the
incident
of
the
policeman
she
snatched
the
cigarette
from
mouth
took
a
puff
and
put
it
back
again
then
she
sat
in
front
of
the
large
mirror
and
did
her
hair
while
marthe
buttoned
her
boots
her
corset
fitted
beautifully
and
as
she
raised
her
arms
above
her
head
under
the
shaded
lamp
could
study
the
marvellous
articulation
of
the
arms
at
the
bare
shoulders
the
close
atmosphere
was
drenched
with
femininity
the
two
women
one
so
stylish
and
the
other
by
contrast
piquantly
a
heavy
slattern
hid
nothing
whatever
from
him
bestowing
on
him
with
perfect
tranquillity
the
right
to
be
there
and
to
watch
at
his
ease
every
mysterious
transaction
the
most
convincing
proof
that
christine
was
authentically
young
and
had
the
illusion
again
that
he
was
in
the
orient
and
it
was
extraordinarily
agreeable
the
recollection
of
the
scene
of
the
lechford
committee
amused
him
like
a
pantomime
witnessed
afar
off
through
a
gauze
curtain
it
had
no
more
reality
than
that
but
he
thought
better
of
the
committee
now
he
perceived
the
wonderful
goodness
of
it
and
of
its
work
it
really
was
running
those
real
hospitals
it
had
a
real
interest
in
them
he
meant
to
do
his
very
best
in
the
accounts
department
after
all
he
had
been
a
lawyer
and
knew
the
routine
of
an
office
and
the
minutest
phenomena
of
a
ledger
he
was
eager
to
begin
how
findest
thou
me
she
stood
for
inspection
she
was
ready
except
the
gloves
the
angle
of
her
hat
the
provocation
of
her
veil
these
things
would
have
quickened
the
pulse
of
a
patagonian
perfume
pervaded
the
room
he
gave
the
classic
response
that
nothing
could
render
trite
es
she
raised
her
veil
just
above
her
mouth
in
the
she
hesitated
and
then
settled
down
on
the
like
a
bird
alighting
and
played
a
few
bars
from
the
waltz
he
was
thunderstruck
for
she
had
got
not
only
the
air
but
some
of
the
accompaniment
right
go
on
go
on
he
urged
her
marvelling
she
turned
smiling
and
shook
her
head
that
is
all
that
i
can
recall
to
myself
the
obvious
sincerity
of
his
appreciation
delighted
her
she
is
really
musical
he
thought
and
was
convinced
that
while
looking
for
a
bit
of
coloured
glass
he
had
picked
up
an
emerald
marthe
produced
his
overcoat
and
when
he
was
ready
for
the
street
christine
gazed
at
him
and
said
for
the
true
there
are
only
englishmen
in
the
taxi
she
proved
to
him
by
delicate
effronteries
the
genuineness
of
her
confessed
fancy
for
him
and
she
poured
out
slang
he
began
to
be
afraid
for
this
excursion
was
an
experiment
such
as
he
had
never
tried
before
in
london
in
paris
of
course
the
code
was
otherwise
but
as
soon
as
the
commissionaire
of
the
restaurant
at
victoria
approached
the
door
of
the
taxi
her
manner
changed
she
walked
up
the
long
interior
with
the
demureness
of
a
young
wife
out
for
the
evening
from
putney
hill
he
thought
relieved
she
is
the
embodiment
of
common
sense
at
the
end
of
the
vista
of
white
tables
the
restaurant
opened
out
to
the
left
in
a
far
corner
they
were
comfortably
secure
from
observation
they
sat
down
a
waiter
beamed
his
flatteries
upon
them
was
serenely
aware
of
his
own
skilled
faculty
for
ordering
a
dinner
he
looked
over
the
menu
card
at
christine
nobody
could
possibly
tell
that
she
was
a
professed
enemy
of
society
these
french
women
are
astounding
he
thought
he
intensely
admired
her
he
was
mad
about
her
his
bliss
was
extreme
he
could
not
keep
it
within
bounds
meet
for
the
great
he
was
happy
as
for
quite
ten
years
he
had
never
hoped
to
be
yes
he
grieved
for
concepcion
but
somehow
grief
could
not
mingle
with
nor
impair
the
happiness
he
felt
and
was
not
concepcion
lying
in
the
affectionate
arms
of
queenie
paulle
christine
glancing
about
her
contentedly
reverted
to
one
of
her
leading
ideas
truly
it
is
very
romantic
thy
london
chapter
the
virgin
christine
went
into
the
oratory
of
philip
at
brompton
on
a
sunday
morning
in
the
following
january
dipped
her
finger
into
one
of
the
italian
basins
at
the
entrance
and
signed
herself
with
the
holy
water
she
was
dressed
in
black
she
had
the
face
of
a
pretty
martyr
her
brow
was
crumpled
by
the
world
sorrow
she
looked
and
actually
was
at
the
moment
intensely
religious
she
had
months
earlier
chosen
the
brompton
oratory
for
her
devotions
partly
because
of
the
name
of
philip
which
had
been
murmured
in
accents
of
affection
by
her
dying
mother
and
partly
because
it
lay
on
a
direct
comprehensible
from
piccadilly
you
got
into
the
opposite
the
end
of
the
burlington
arcade
and
in
about
six
minutes
it
dropped
you
in
front
of
the
oratory
and
you
could
not
possibly
lose
yourself
in
the
topographical
intricacies
of
the
unknown
city
christine
never
took
a
taxi
except
when
on
business
the
interior
was
gloomy
with
the
winter
forenoon
the
broad
renaissance
arches
showed
themselves
only
faintly
above
on
every
side
there
were
little
archipelagos
of
light
made
by
groups
of
candles
in
front
of
great
pale
images
the
church
was
comparatively
empty
and
most
of
the
people
present
were
kneeling
in
the
chapels
for
christine
had
purposely
come
as
she
always
did
at
the
slack
hour
between
the
seventh
and
last
of
the
early
morning
low
masses
and
the
high
mass
at
eleven
she
went
up
the
right
aisle
and
stopped
before
the
miraculous
infant
jesus
of
prague
a
charming
and
naive
little
figure
about
eighteen
inches
high
in
a
stiff
embroidered
cloak
and
a
huge
symbol
upon
his
curly
head
she
had
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
the
miraculous
infant
jesus
of
prague
she
liked
him
he
was
a
change
from
the
virgin
and
he
stood
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
whole
interior
behind
the
black
statue
of
peter
with
protruding
toe
and
within
the
deep
shadow
made
by
the
overhead
also
he
had
a
motto
in
french
plus
vous
plus
je
vous
favoriserai
christine
hesitated
and
then
left
the
miraculous
infant
jesus
of
prague
without
even
a
transient
genuflexion
she
was
afraid
to
devote
herself
to
him
that
morning
of
course
she
had
been
brought
up
strictly
in
the
roman
catholic
faith
and
in
her
own
esteem
she
was
still
an
honest
catholic
for
years
she
had
not
confessed
and
therefore
had
not
communicated
for
years
she
had
had
a
desire
to
cast
herself
down
at
a
but
she
had
not
done
so
because
of
one
of
the
questions
in
the
which
she
used
péché
par
pensée
parole
ou
action
contre
la
pureté
ou
la
modestie
and
because
also
of
the
preliminary
injunction
maintenant
essayez
de
vous
rappeler
vos
péchés
combien
de
fois
vous
les
avez
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
that
once
she
had
confessed
a
great
deal
to
a
priest
at
sens
but
he
had
treated
her
too
lightly
his
lightness
with
her
had
indeed
been
shameful
since
then
she
had
never
confessed
further
she
knew
herself
to
be
in
a
state
of
mortal
sin
by
reason
of
her
frequent
wilful
neglect
of
the
holy
offices
and
occasionally
at
the
most
inconvenient
moments
the
conviction
that
if
she
died
she
was
damned
would
triumph
over
her
complacency
but
on
the
whole
she
had
hopes
for
the
future
though
she
had
sinned
her
sin
was
mysteriously
not
like
other
people
sin
of
exactly
the
same
kind
and
finally
there
was
the
virgin
mary
the
sweet
and
dependable
goddess
she
had
been
neglecting
the
very
clement
virgin
mary
in
favour
of
the
miraculous
infant
jesus
of
prague
a
whim
a
thoughtless
caprice
which
she
had
paid
for
the
virgin
mary
had
withdrawn
her
defending
shield
at
least
that
was
the
interpretation
which
christine
was
bound
to
put
upon
the
terrible
incident
of
the
previous
night
in
the
promenade
she
had
quite
innocently
been
involved
in
a
drunken
row
in
the
lounge
two
military
officers
one
of
whom
unnoticed
by
christine
was
intoxicated
and
two
women
madame
larivaudière
and
christine
the
belgian
had
been
growing
more
and
more
jealous
of
christine
the
row
had
flamed
up
in
the
tenth
of
a
second
like
an
explosion
the
two
officers
then
the
two
women
the
bright
silvery
sound
of
glass
shattered
on
marble
high
voices
deep
voices
half
the
promenade
had
rushed
vulgarly
into
the
lounge
panting
with
a
gross
appetite
to
witness
a
vulgar
scene
and
as
the
belgian
was
jealous
of
the
french
girl
so
were
the
english
girls
horribly
jealous
of
all
the
foreign
girls
and
scornful
too
nothing
but
the
overwhelming
desire
of
the
management
to
maintain
the
perfect
respectability
of
its
promenade
had
prevented
a
between
the
officers
as
for
madame
larivaudière
she
had
been
ejected
and
told
never
to
return
christine
had
fled
to
the
where
she
had
remained
for
half
an
hour
and
thence
had
vanished
away
solitary
by
the
side
entrance
it
was
precisely
such
an
episode
as
christine
mother
would
have
deprecated
in
horror
and
as
christine
herself
intensely
loathed
and
she
could
never
assuage
the
moral
wound
of
it
by
confiding
the
affair
to
gilbert
she
was
mad
about
gilbert
she
thrilled
to
be
his
slave
she
had
what
seemed
an
immeasurable
confidence
in
him
and
yet
never
never
could
she
mention
another
individual
man
to
him
much
less
tell
him
of
the
public
shame
that
had
fallen
upon
her
in
the
exercise
of
her
profession
why
had
fate
been
thus
hard
on
her
the
answer
was
surely
to
be
found
in
the
displeasure
of
the
virgin
and
so
she
did
not
dare
to
stay
with
the
miraculous
infant
jesus
of
prague
nor
even
to
murmur
the
prayer
beginning
adorable
jésus
divin
modèle
de
la
perfection
she
glanced
round
the
great
church
considering
what
were
to
her
the
major
and
minor
gods
and
goddesses
on
their
ornate
thrones
antony
joseph
sebastian
philip
the
sacred
heart
cecilia
peter
wilfrid
mary
magdelene
ah
not
at
that
altar
could
she
be
seen
patrick
veronica
francis
john
baptist
teresa
our
lady
our
lady
of
good
counsel
no
there
was
only
one
goddess
possible
for
her
our
lady
of
vii
dolours
she
crossed
the
wide
nave
to
the
severe
black
and
white
marble
chapel
of
the
vii
dolours
the
aspect
of
the
shrine
suited
her
on
one
side
she
read
the
english
words
of
your
charity
pray
for
the
soul
of
flora
duchess
of
norfolk
who
put
up
this
altar
to
the
mother
of
sorrows
that
they
who
mourn
may
be
comforted
and
the
very
words
were
romantic
to
her
and
she
thought
of
flora
duchess
of
norfolk
as
a
figure
inexpressibly
more
romantic
than
the
illustrious
female
figures
of
french
history
the
virgin
of
the
vii
dolours
was
enigmatically
gazing
at
her
waiting
no
doubt
to
be
placated
the
virgin
was
painted
gigantic
in
oil
on
canvas
but
on
her
breast
stood
out
a
heart
made
in
three
dimensions
of
real
silver
and
pierced
by
the
swords
of
the
seven
dolours
three
to
the
left
and
four
to
the
right
and
in
front
was
a
tiny
gold
figure
of
jesus
crucified
on
a
gold
cross
christine
cast
herself
down
and
prayed
to
the
painted
image
and
the
hammered
heart
she
prayed
to
the
goddess
whom
the
middle
ages
had
perfected
and
who
in
the
minds
of
the
simple
and
the
savage
has
survived
the
renaissance
and
still
triumphantly
flourishes
the
queen
of
heaven
the
tyrant
of
heaven
the
woman
in
heaven
who
was
so
venerated
that
even
her
sweat
is
exhibited
as
a
relic
who
was
softer
than
christ
as
christ
was
softer
than
the
father
who
in
becoming
a
goddess
had
increased
her
humanity
who
put
living
roses
for
a
sign
into
the
mouths
of
fornicators
when
they
died
if
only
they
had
been
faithful
to
her
who
told
the
amorous
sacristan
to
kiss
her
face
and
not
her
feet
who
questioned
lovers
about
their
mistresses
is
she
as
pretty
as
i
who
fell
like
a
pestilence
on
the
nuptial
chambers
of
young
men
who
professing
love
for
her
had
taken
another
bride
who
enjoyed
being
amused
who
admitted
a
weakness
for
artists
tumblers
soldiers
and
the
common
herd
who
had
visibly
led
both
opponents
on
every
battlefield
for
centuries
who
impersonated
absent
disreputable
nuns
and
did
their
work
for
them
until
they
returned
repentant
to
be
forgiven
by
her
who
acted
always
on
her
instinct
and
never
on
her
reason
who
cared
nothing
for
legal
principles
who
openly
used
her
feminine
influence
with
the
trinity
who
filled
heaven
with
and
who
had
never
on
any
pretext
driven
a
soul
out
of
heaven
christine
made
peace
with
this
jealous
and
divine
creature
she
felt
unmistakably
that
she
was
forgiven
for
her
infidelity
due
to
the
infant
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
opposite
aisle
the
face
of
the
lady
of
vii
dolours
miraculously
smiled
at
her
the
silver
heart
miraculously
shed
its
tarnish
and
glittered
beneficent
lightnings
doubtless
she
knew
somewhere
in
her
mind
that
no
physical
change
had
occurred
in
the
picture
or
the
heart
but
her
mind
was
a
complex
and
like
nearly
all
minds
could
disbelieve
and
believe
simultaneously
just
as
high
mass
was
beginning
she
rose
and
in
grave
solace
left
the
oratory
she
would
not
endanger
her
new
peace
with
the
virgin
mary
by
any
devotion
to
other
gods
she
was
solemn
but
happy
the
conductor
who
took
her
penny
in
the
never
suspected
that
on
the
pane
before
her
where
some
agency
had
caused
to
be
printed
in
colour
the
words
seek
ye
the
she
saw
in
addition
to
the
amazing
oddness
of
the
race
a
dangerous
incitement
to
unfaith
she
kept
her
thoughts
passionately
on
the
virgin
and
by
the
time
the
bus
had
reached
hyde
park
corner
she
was
utterly
sure
that
the
horrible
adventure
of
the
promenade
was
purged
of
its
evil
potentialities
in
the
house
in
cork
street
she
took
out
her
placidly
opened
the
door
and
entered
smiling
at
the
solitude
marthe
who
also
had
a
soul
in
need
of
succour
would
in
the
ordinary
course
have
gone
forth
to
a
smaller
church
and
a
late
mass
but
on
this
particular
morning
fat
marthe
in
déshabille
came
running
to
her
from
the
little
kitchen
oh
madame
there
is
someone
he
is
drunk
her
voice
was
outraged
she
pointed
fearfully
to
the
bedroom
christine
courageous
walked
straight
in
an
officer
in
khaki
was
lying
on
the
bed
his
muddy
spurred
boots
had
soiled
the
white
lace
coverlet
he
was
asleep
and
snoring
she
looked
at
him
and
recognising
her
acquaintance
of
the
previous
night
wondered
what
the
very
clement
virgin
could
be
about
chapter
sunday
afternoon
what
is
madame
going
to
do
whispered
marthe
still
alarmed
and
shocked
when
they
had
both
stepped
back
out
of
the
bedroom
and
she
added
he
has
never
been
here
before
marthe
was
a
woman
of
immense
experience
but
little
brains
and
when
phenomena
passed
beyond
her
experience
she
became
rather
like
a
foolish
raw
girl
she
had
often
dealt
with
drunken
men
she
had
often
especially
in
her
younger
days
satisfactorily
explained
a
situation
to
visitors
who
happened
to
call
when
her
mistress
for
the
time
being
was
out
but
only
on
the
very
rarest
occasions
had
she
known
a
client
commit
the
awful
solecism
of
calling
before
lunch
and
that
a
newcomer
even
intoxicated
should
commit
this
solecism
staggered
her
and
left
her
trembling
what
am
i
going
to
do
nothing
answered
christine
let
him
sleep
christine
too
was
dismayed
but
marthe
weakness
gave
her
strength
and
she
would
not
show
her
fright
moreover
christine
had
some
force
of
character
though
it
did
not
often
show
itself
as
sudden
firmness
she
condescended
to
marthe
she
also
condescended
to
the
officer
because
he
was
unconscious
because
he
had
put
himself
in
a
false
position
because
sooner
or
later
he
would
look
extremely
silly
she
regarded
the
officer
intrusion
as
tiresome
but
she
did
not
gravely
resent
it
after
all
he
was
drunk
and
before
the
row
in
the
promenade
he
had
asked
her
for
her
card
saying
that
he
was
engaged
that
night
but
would
like
to
know
where
she
lived
of
course
she
had
protested
as
what
woman
in
her
place
would
not
against
the
theory
that
he
was
engaged
that
night
and
she
had
been
in
a
fair
way
to
convince
him
that
he
was
not
really
engaged
that
night
except
morally
to
her
since
he
had
accosted
her
when
the
quarrel
had
supervened
and
it
had
dawned
on
her
that
he
had
been
in
the
taciturn
and
cautious
stage
of
acute
inebriety
he
had
it
now
seemed
probably
been
drinking
through
the
night
there
were
men
as
she
knew
who
simply
had
to
have
bouts
whose
only
method
to
peace
was
to
drown
the
demon
within
them
she
would
never
knowingly
touch
a
drunken
man
or
even
a
partially
intoxicated
man
if
she
could
help
it
she
was
not
a
bit
like
the
polite
young
lady
above
who
seemed
to
specialise
in
noisy
tipplers
her
way
with
the
was
to
leave
them
to
recover
in
tranquillity
no
other
way
was
safe
nevertheless
in
the
present
instance
she
did
venture
again
into
the
bedroom
the
plight
of
the
lace
coverlet
troubled
her
and
practically
drove
her
into
the
bedroom
she
got
a
little
towel
gently
lifted
the
sleeper
left
foot
and
tied
the
towel
round
his
boot
then
she
did
the
same
to
his
other
foot
the
man
did
not
stir
but
if
later
he
should
stir
neither
his
boots
nor
his
spurs
could
do
further
harm
to
the
lace
coverlet
his
cane
and
gloves
were
on
the
floor
she
picked
them
up
his
overcoat
apparently
of
excellent
quality
was
still
on
his
back
and
the
cap
had
not
quite
departed
from
his
head
christine
had
learned
enough
about
english
military
signs
and
symbols
to
enable
her
to
perceive
that
he
belonged
to
the
artillery
but
how
will
madame
change
her
dress
marthe
demanded
in
the
madame
always
changed
her
dress
immediately
on
returning
from
church
for
that
which
is
suitable
for
mass
may
not
be
proper
to
other
ends
i
shall
not
change
said
christine
it
is
well
madame
christine
was
not
deterred
from
changing
by
the
fact
that
the
bedroom
was
occupied
she
retained
her
church
dress
because
she
foresaw
the
great
advantage
she
would
derive
from
it
in
the
encounter
which
must
ultimately
occur
with
the
visitor
she
would
not
even
take
her
hat
off
the
two
women
lunched
mainly
on
macaroni
with
some
cheese
and
an
apple
christine
had
coffee
ah
she
must
always
have
her
coffee
as
for
a
cigarette
she
never
smoked
when
alone
because
she
did
not
really
care
for
smoking
marthe
however
enjoyed
smoking
and
christine
gave
her
a
cigarette
which
she
lighted
while
clearing
the
table
one
was
mistress
the
other
servant
but
the
two
women
were
constantly
meeting
on
the
plane
of
equality
neither
of
them
could
avoid
it
or
consistently
tried
to
avoid
it
although
marthe
did
not
eat
with
christine
if
a
meal
was
in
progress
she
generally
came
into
the
with
her
mouth
more
or
less
full
of
food
their
repasts
were
trifles
passovers
unceremonious
and
irregular
peckings
begun
and
finished
in
a
few
moments
and
if
marthe
was
always
untidy
in
her
person
christine
up
till
three
in
the
afternoon
was
also
untidy
they
went
about
the
flat
in
a
wonderful
state
of
unkempt
and
insecure
slovenliness
and
sometimes
marthe
might
be
lolling
in
the
over
the
illustrations
in
vie
which
was
part
of
the
apparatus
of
the
flat
while
christine
was
in
the
tiny
kitchen
washing
gloves
as
she
alone
could
wash
them
the
flat
lapsed
into
at
any
rate
a
superficial
calm
marthe
seeing
that
fate
had
deprived
her
of
the
usual
consolations
of
religion
determined
to
reward
herself
by
remaining
a
perfect
slattern
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
would
not
change
at
all
she
would
not
wash
up
either
the
breakfast
things
or
the
lunch
things
leaving
a
small
ring
of
gas
alight
in
the
gas
stove
she
sat
down
all
dirty
on
a
hard
chair
in
front
of
it
and
fell
into
a
luxurious
catalepsy
in
the
christine
sat
upright
on
the
sofa
and
read
lusciously
a
french
translation
of
she
was
in
no
hurry
for
the
man
to
waken
her
sense
of
time
was
very
imperfect
she
was
never
pricked
by
the
thought
that
life
is
short
and
that
many
urgent
things
demand
to
be
done
before
the
grave
opens
nor
was
she
apprehensive
of
unpleasant
complications
the
man
was
in
the
flat
but
it
was
her
flat
her
law
ran
in
the
flat
and
the
door
was
fast
against
invasion
still
the
gentle
snore
of
the
man
rising
and
falling
dominated
the
flat
and
the
fact
of
his
presence
preoccupied
the
one
woman
in
the
kitchen
and
the
other
in
the
christine
noticed
that
the
thickness
of
the
pages
read
had
imperceptibly
increased
to
of
an
inch
while
the
thickness
of
the
unread
pages
had
diminished
to
a
quarter
of
an
inch
and
she
also
noticed
on
the
open
page
another
phenomenon
it
was
the
failing
of
the
day
the
faintest
shadow
on
the
page
with
incredible
transience
another
of
those
brief
interruptions
of
darkness
which
in
london
in
winter
are
called
days
was
ending
she
rose
and
went
to
the
window
and
conscious
of
the
extreme
propriety
of
her
appearance
boldly
pulled
aside
the
curtain
and
looked
across
through
naked
glass
at
the
hotel
nearly
opposite
there
was
not
a
sound
not
a
movement
in
cork
street
cork
street
the
flat
the
hotel
the
city
the
universe
lay
entranced
and
stupefied
beneath
the
grey
vapours
of
the
sabbath
the
sensation
to
christine
was
melancholy
but
it
was
exquisitely
melancholy
the
solid
hotel
dissolved
and
in
its
place
christine
saw
the
interesting
pathetic
phantom
of
her
own
existence
a
stern
serious
existence
full
of
disappointments
and
not
free
from
dangerous
episodes
an
existence
which
entailed
much
solitude
and
loss
of
liberty
but
the
verdict
upon
it
was
that
in
the
main
it
might
easily
have
been
more
unsatisfactory
than
it
was
with
her
indolence
and
her
unappeasable
temperament
what
other
vocation
indeed
save
that
of
marriage
could
she
have
taken
up
and
her
temperament
would
have
rendered
any
marriage
an
impossible
prison
for
her
she
was
a
modest
success
her
mother
had
always
counselled
her
against
ambition
but
she
was
a
success
her
magic
power
was
at
its
height
she
continued
to
save
money
and
had
become
a
fairly
regular
frequenter
of
the
west
end
branch
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
incidentally
she
had
come
to
an
arrangement
with
her
paris
landlord
but
more
important
than
money
she
was
saving
her
health
and
especially
her
complexion
the
source
of
money
her
complexion
could
still
survive
the
minutest
examination
she
achieved
this
supreme
end
by
plenty
of
sleep
and
by
keeping
to
the
minimum
of
alcohol
of
course
she
had
to
drink
professionally
clients
insisted
some
of
them
were
exhilarated
by
the
spectacle
of
a
girl
tipsy
but
she
was
very
ingenious
in
avoiding
alcohol
when
invited
to
supper
she
would
respond
with
an
air
of
restrained
eagerness
oh
yes
with
pleasure
and
then
carelessly
add
unless
you
would
prefer
to
come
quietly
home
with
me
my
maid
is
an
excellent
cook
and
one
is
very
comfortable
and
often
the
prospect
thus
sketched
would
piquantly
allure
a
client
nevertheless
at
intervals
she
could
savour
a
fashionable
restaurant
as
well
as
any
minx
there
her
secret
fear
was
still
obesity
she
was
capable
of
imagining
herself
at
fat
as
marthe
and
ruined
for
though
a
few
peculiar
amateurs
appreciated
solidity
the
great
majority
of
men
did
not
however
she
was
not
getting
stouter
she
had
a
secret
sincere
respect
for
certain
of
her
own
qualities
and
if
women
of
the
world
condemned
certain
other
qualities
in
her
well
she
despised
women
of
the
world
selfish
idlers
who
did
nothing
who
contributed
nothing
to
the
sum
of
life
whereas
she
was
a
useful
and
indispensable
member
of
society
despite
her
admitted
indolence
in
this
summary
way
she
comforted
herself
in
her
loss
of
caste
without
gilbert
of
course
her
existence
would
have
been
fatally
dull
and
she
might
have
been
driven
to
terrible
remedies
against
ennui
and
emptiness
the
depth
and
violence
of
her
feeling
for
gilbert
were
indescribable
at
any
rate
by
her
she
turned
again
from
the
darkening
window
to
the
sofa
and
sat
down
and
tried
to
recall
the
figures
of
the
dozens
of
men
who
had
sat
there
and
she
could
recall
at
most
six
or
eight
and
gilbert
alone
was
real
what
a
paragon
her
scorn
for
girls
who
succumbed
to
was
measureless
as
a
fact
she
had
met
few
who
did
she
would
have
liked
to
beautify
her
flat
for
gilbert
but
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
wish
to
spend
money
on
it
in
the
second
place
she
was
too
indolent
to
buckle
to
the
enterprise
and
in
the
third
place
if
she
beautified
it
she
would
be
doing
so
not
for
gilbert
but
for
the
monotonous
procession
of
her
clients
her
flat
was
a
public
resort
and
so
she
would
do
nothing
to
it
besides
she
did
not
care
a
fig
about
the
look
of
furniture
the
feel
of
furniture
alone
interested
her
she
wanted
softness
and
warmth
and
no
more
she
moved
across
to
the
piano
remembering
that
she
had
not
practised
that
day
and
that
she
had
promised
gilbert
to
practise
every
day
he
was
teaching
her
at
the
beginning
she
had
dreamt
of
acquiring
brilliance
such
as
his
on
the
piano
but
she
had
soon
seen
the
futility
of
the
dream
and
had
moderated
her
hopes
accordingly
even
with
terrific
efforts
she
could
not
make
her
hands
do
the
things
that
his
did
quite
easily
at
the
first
attempt
she
had
for
example
abandoned
the
waltz
having
never
succeeded
in
struggling
through
more
than
about
ten
bars
of
it
and
those
the
simplest
but
her
french
dances
she
had
notably
improved
in
she
knew
some
of
them
by
heart
and
could
patter
them
off
with
a
very
tasteful
vivacity
instead
of
practising
she
now
played
gently
through
a
slow
waltz
from
memory
if
the
snoring
man
was
wakened
so
much
the
worse
or
so
much
the
better
she
went
on
playing
and
evening
continued
to
fall
until
she
could
scarcely
see
the
notes
then
she
heard
movements
in
the
bedroom
a
sigh
a
bump
some
english
words
that
she
did
not
comprehend
she
still
by
force
of
resolution
went
on
playing
to
protect
herself
to
give
herself
countenance
at
length
she
saw
a
dim
male
figure
against
the
pale
oblong
of
the
doorway
between
the
two
rooms
and
behind
the
figure
a
point
of
glowing
red
in
the
stove
i
say
what
time
is
it
she
recognised
the
heavy
resonant
vibrating
voice
she
had
stopped
playing
because
she
was
making
so
many
mistakes
late
late
she
murmured
timidly
the
next
moment
the
figure
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
and
her
left
hand
had
been
seized
in
a
hot
hand
and
kissed
respectfully
forgive
me
you
beautiful
creature
begged
the
deep
imploring
voice
i
know
i
do
deserve
it
but
forgive
me
i
worship
women
honestly
assuredly
she
had
not
expected
this
development
she
thought
is
he
not
sober
yet
but
the
query
had
no
conviction
in
it
she
wanted
to
believe
that
he
was
sober
at
any
rate
he
had
removed
the
absurd
towels
from
his
boots
chapter
the
mystic
say
you
forgive
me
the
officer
insisted
but
there
is
nothing
say
you
forgive
me
she
had
counted
on
a
scene
of
triumph
with
him
when
he
woke
up
anticipating
that
he
was
bound
to
cut
a
ridiculous
appearance
he
knelt
dimly
there
without
a
sign
of
or
false
shame
she
forgave
him
great
baby
her
hand
was
kissed
again
and
loosed
she
detected
a
faint
sad
smile
on
his
face
ah
he
rose
towering
above
her
i
know
i
a
drunken
sot
he
said
it
was
only
because
i
knew
i
was
drunk
that
i
did
want
to
come
with
you
last
night
and
i
called
this
morning
to
apologise
i
did
really
i
no
other
thought
in
my
poor
old
head
i
wanted
you
to
understand
why
i
tried
to
hit
that
chap
the
other
woman
had
spoken
to
me
earlier
and
i
suppose
she
was
jealous
seeing
me
with
you
she
said
something
to
him
about
you
and
he
laughed
and
i
had
to
hit
him
for
laughing
i
could
hit
her
if
i
caught
him
an
upper
cut
with
my
left
he
have
gone
down
and
he
would
have
got
up
by
himself
warrant
you
what
did
she
say
christine
interrupted
not
comprehending
the
technical
idiom
and
not
interested
in
it
i
dunno
but
he
laughed
anyhow
he
smiled
christine
turned
on
the
light
and
then
went
quickly
to
the
window
to
draw
the
curtains
take
off
your
overcoat
she
commanded
him
kindly
he
obeyed
blinking
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
raising
her
arms
drew
the
pins
from
her
hat
and
put
it
on
the
table
she
motioned
him
to
sit
down
too
and
left
him
a
narrow
space
between
herself
and
the
arm
of
the
sofa
so
that
they
were
very
close
together
then
with
puckered
brow
she
examined
him
i
better
tell
you
he
said
it
does
me
good
to
confess
to
you
you
beautiful
thing
i
had
a
bottle
of
whisky
upstairs
in
my
room
at
the
grosvenor
night
before
last
when
i
arrived
there
i
could
get
to
sleep
in
the
bed
had
been
used
to
a
bed
for
so
long
you
know
i
had
to
turn
out
and
roll
myself
up
in
a
blanket
on
the
floor
and
last
night
i
spent
drinking
by
myself
yes
by
myself
somehow
i
do
mind
telling
this
morning
i
must
have
been
worse
than
i
thought
i
was
he
stopped
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
little
thing
let
me
kiss
your
eyes
no
i
respect
you
i
worship
you
you
the
nicest
little
woman
i
ever
saw
and
i
a
brute
but
let
me
kiss
your
eyes
she
held
her
face
seriously
even
frowning
somewhat
and
he
kissed
her
eyes
gently
one
after
the
other
and
she
smelt
his
contaminated
breath
he
was
a
spare
man
with
a
rather
thin
ingenuous
mysterious
romantic
appealing
face
it
was
true
that
her
eyes
had
moistened
she
was
touched
by
his
look
and
his
tone
as
he
told
her
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
lie
on
the
floor
of
his
bedroom
in
order
to
sleep
there
seemed
to
be
an
infinite
pathos
in
that
trifle
he
was
one
of
the
fighters
he
had
fought
he
was
come
from
the
horrors
of
the
battle
a
man
of
power
he
had
killed
and
he
was
probably
ten
or
a
dozen
years
her
senior
nevertheless
she
felt
herself
to
be
older
than
he
was
wiser
more
experienced
she
almost
wanted
to
nurse
him
and
for
her
he
was
too
the
protected
of
the
very
clement
virgin
inquiries
from
marthe
showed
that
he
must
have
entered
the
flat
at
the
moment
when
she
was
kneeling
at
the
altar
and
when
the
lady
of
vii
dolours
had
miraculously
granted
to
her
pardon
and
peace
he
was
part
of
the
miracle
she
had
a
duty
to
him
and
her
duty
was
to
brighten
his
destiny
to
give
him
joy
not
to
let
him
go
without
a
charming
memory
of
her
soft
womanly
acquiescences
at
the
same
time
her
temperament
was
aroused
by
his
personality
and
she
did
not
forget
she
had
a
living
to
earn
but
still
her
chief
concern
was
his
satisfaction
not
her
own
and
her
overmastering
sentiment
one
of
dutiful
nay
religious
surrender
french
gratitude
of
the
english
fighter
and
a
mystic
fearful
allegiance
to
the
very
clement
virgin
these
things
inspired
her
ah
he
sighed
my
throat
like
leather
and
seeing
that
she
did
not
follow
he
added
thirsty
he
stretched
his
arms
she
went
to
the
sideboard
and
half
filled
a
tumbler
with
soda
water
from
the
siphon
drink
she
said
as
if
to
a
child
just
a
dash
the
tiniest
dash
he
pleaded
in
his
rich
voice
with
a
glance
at
the
whisky
you
do
know
how
it
pull
me
together
you
do
know
how
i
need
it
but
she
did
know
and
she
humoured
him
shaking
her
head
disapprovingly
he
drank
and
smacked
his
lips
ah
he
breathed
voluptuously
and
then
said
in
changed
playful
accents
your
french
accent
is
exquisite
it
makes
english
sound
quite
beautiful
and
you
the
daintiest
little
thing
daintiest
what
is
that
i
have
much
to
learn
in
english
but
it
is
something
nice
daintiest
it
is
a
compliment
she
somehow
understood
then
that
despite
appearances
he
was
not
really
a
devotee
of
her
sex
that
he
was
really
a
solitary
that
he
would
never
die
of
love
and
that
her
was
a
minor
in
his
existence
and
she
accepted
the
fact
with
humility
with
enthusiasm
with
ardour
quite
ready
to
please
and
to
be
forgotten
in
playing
the
slave
to
him
she
had
the
fierce
french
illusion
of
killing
germans
suddenly
she
noticed
that
he
was
wearing
two
one
close
to
the
other
on
his
left
arm
and
she
remarked
on
the
strange
fact
the
officer
face
changed
have
you
got
a
he
demanded
no
silently
he
unfastened
one
of
the
watches
and
then
said
hold
out
your
beautiful
arm
she
did
so
he
fastened
the
watch
on
her
arm
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
a
lady
watch
the
black
strap
was
deeply
scratched
she
privately
reconstructed
the
history
of
the
watch
and
decided
that
it
must
be
a
gift
returned
after
a
quarrel
and
perhaps
the
scratches
on
the
strap
had
something
to
do
with
the
quarrel
i
beg
you
to
accept
it
he
said
i
particularly
wish
you
to
accept
it
it
really
a
lovely
watch
she
exclaimed
how
kind
you
are
she
rewarded
him
with
a
warm
kiss
i
have
always
wanted
a
and
now
they
are
so
in
fact
one
must
have
one
moving
her
arm
about
she
admired
the
watch
at
different
angles
it
is
going
and
what
more
it
wo
go
he
said
ah
she
politely
murmured
no
but
do
you
know
why
i
give
you
that
watch
why
because
it
is
a
mascot
true
absolutely
a
mascot
it
belonged
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
dead
ah
a
lady
no
not
a
lady
a
man
he
gave
it
me
a
few
minutes
before
he
died
and
he
was
wearing
it
and
he
told
me
to
take
it
off
his
arm
as
soon
as
he
was
dead
i
did
so
christine
was
somewhat
alarmed
but
if
he
was
wearing
it
when
he
died
how
can
it
be
a
mascot
that
was
what
made
it
a
mascot
believe
me
i
know
about
these
things
i
would
deceive
you
and
i
would
tell
you
it
was
a
mascot
unless
i
was
quite
certain
he
spoke
with
a
quiet
initiated
authority
that
reassured
her
entirely
and
gave
her
the
most
perfect
confidence
and
why
was
your
friend
wearing
a
lady
watch
i
can
not
tell
you
you
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
but
i
know
that
watch
is
a
mascot
was
it
at
the
front
all
this
the
man
nodded
he
was
wounded
killed
your
friend
no
no
not
wounded
he
was
in
my
battery
we
were
galloping
some
guns
to
a
new
position
he
came
off
his
horse
the
horse
was
shot
under
him
he
himself
fell
in
front
of
a
gun
of
course
the
drivers
dared
not
stop
and
there
was
no
room
to
swerve
hence
they
had
to
drive
right
over
him
later
i
came
back
to
him
they
had
got
him
as
far
as
the
advanced
he
died
in
less
than
an
hour
solemnity
fell
between
christine
and
her
client
she
said
softly
but
if
it
is
a
mascot
do
you
not
need
it
you
at
the
front
it
is
wrong
for
me
to
take
it
i
have
my
own
mascot
nothing
can
touch
me
except
my
great
enemy
and
he
is
not
german
with
an
austere
gesture
he
indicated
the
glass
his
deep
voice
was
sad
but
very
firm
christine
felt
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
an
adept
of
mysticism
the
virgin
had
sent
this
man
to
her
and
the
man
had
given
her
the
watch
clearly
the
heavenly
power
had
her
in
its
holy
charge
ah
yes
said
the
man
in
a
new
tone
as
if
realising
the
solemnity
and
its
inappropriateness
and
trying
to
dissipate
it
ah
yes
once
we
had
the
day
of
our
lives
together
he
and
i
we
got
a
day
off
to
go
and
see
a
new
trench
mortar
and
we
did
have
a
time
trench
mortar
what
is
that
he
explained
but
tell
me
how
it
works
she
insisted
not
because
she
had
the
slightest
genuine
interest
in
the
technical
details
of
war
for
she
had
not
but
because
she
desired
to
help
him
to
change
the
mood
of
the
scene
well
it
not
so
easy
you
know
it
was
a
four
and
a
half
pound
shell
filled
with
slabs
and
shrapnel
bullets
packed
in
sawdust
the
charge
was
black
powder
in
a
paper
bag
and
you
stuck
it
at
the
bottom
end
of
the
pipe
and
put
a
bit
of
fuse
into
the
but
of
course
you
must
take
care
it
penetrates
the
charge
the
has
a
pinner
with
a
detonator
with
the
right
length
of
fuse
shoved
into
it
you
wrap
some
clay
round
the
end
of
the
fuse
to
stop
the
flash
of
the
charge
from
detonating
the
shell
well
then
you
load
the
shell
she
comprehended
simply
nothing
and
the
man
professionally
absorbed
seemed
to
have
no
perception
that
she
was
comprehending
nothing
she
scarcely
even
listened
her
face
was
set
in
a
courteous
formal
smile
but
all
the
time
she
was
thinking
that
the
man
in
spite
of
his
qualities
must
be
lacking
in
character
to
give
a
watch
away
to
a
woman
to
whom
he
had
not
been
talking
for
ten
minutes
his
lack
of
character
was
shown
also
in
his
unshamed
confession
concerning
his
real
enemy
some
men
would
bare
their
souls
to
a
in
a
fashion
that
was
flattering
neither
to
themselves
nor
to
the
and
christine
never
really
respected
such
men
she
did
not
really
respect
this
man
but
respected
and
stood
in
awe
of
his
mysticism
and
further
her
instinct
to
satisfy
him
to
make
a
spoiled
boy
of
him
was
not
in
the
least
weakened
then
just
as
the
man
was
in
the
middle
of
his
description
of
the
functioning
of
the
trench
mortar
the
rang
and
christine
excused
herself
the
telephone
was
in
the
bedroom
not
by
the
bedside
for
such
a
situation
had
its
inconveniences
but
in
the
farthest
corner
between
the
window
and
the
washstand
as
she
went
to
the
telephone
she
was
preoccupied
by
one
of
the
major
worries
of
her
vocation
the
worry
of
keeping
clients
out
of
each
other
sight
she
wondered
who
could
be
telephoning
to
her
on
sunday
evening
not
gilbert
for
gilbert
never
telephoned
on
sunday
except
in
the
morning
she
insisted
of
course
on
his
telephoning
to
her
daily
or
almost
daily
she
did
this
to
several
of
her
more
reliable
friends
for
there
was
no
surer
way
of
convincing
them
of
the
genuineness
of
her
regard
for
them
than
to
vituperate
them
when
they
failed
to
keep
her
informed
of
their
health
their
spirits
and
their
doings
in
the
case
of
gilbert
however
her
insistence
had
entirely
ceased
to
be
a
professional
device
she
adored
him
violently
the
telephoner
was
gilbert
he
made
an
amazing
suggestion
he
asked
her
to
come
across
to
his
flat
where
she
had
never
been
and
where
he
had
never
asked
her
to
go
it
had
been
tacitly
and
quite
amiably
understood
between
them
that
he
was
not
one
who
invited
young
ladies
to
his
own
apartments
christine
cautiously
answered
that
she
was
not
sure
whether
she
could
come
are
you
alone
he
asked
pleasantly
yes
quite
well
i
will
come
and
fetch
you
she
decided
exactly
what
she
would
do
no
no
i
will
come
i
will
come
now
i
shall
be
enchanted
purposely
she
spoke
without
conviction
maintaining
a
mysterious
reserve
she
returned
to
the
and
the
other
man
fortunately
the
conversation
on
the
telephone
had
been
in
french
see
she
said
speaking
and
feeling
as
though
they
were
intimates
i
have
a
lady
friend
who
is
ill
i
am
called
to
see
her
i
shall
not
be
long
i
swear
to
you
i
shall
not
be
long
wait
will
you
wait
yes
he
replied
gazing
at
her
put
yourself
at
your
ease
she
was
relieved
to
find
that
she
could
so
easily
reconcile
her
desire
to
please
gilbert
with
her
pleasurable
duty
towards
the
protégé
of
the
very
clement
virgin
chapter
the
visit
in
the
doorway
of
his
flat
christine
kissed
vehemently
but
with
a
certain
preoccupation
she
was
looking
about
her
very
curious
the
way
in
which
she
raised
her
veil
and
raised
her
face
mysteriously
glanced
at
him
puckered
her
kind
brow
these
things
thrilled
him
she
said
you
are
quite
alone
of
course
she
said
it
nicely
even
benevolently
nevertheless
he
seemed
to
hear
her
saying
you
are
quite
alone
or
of
course
you
would
have
let
me
come
i
suppose
it
through
here
she
murmured
and
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
she
passed
direct
into
the
lighted
and
stood
there
observant
he
followed
her
they
were
both
nervous
in
the
midst
of
the
interior
which
he
was
showing
her
for
the
first
time
and
which
she
was
silently
estimating
for
him
she
made
an
exquisite
figure
in
the
she
was
so
correct
in
her
so
modest
prim
and
demure
and
her
appearance
clashed
excitingly
with
his
absolute
knowledge
of
her
secret
temperament
he
had
often
hesitated
in
his
judgment
of
her
was
she
good
enough
or
was
she
not
but
now
he
thought
more
highly
of
her
than
ever
she
was
ideal
divine
the
realisation
of
a
dream
and
he
felt
extraordinarily
pleased
with
himself
because
after
much
cautious
indecision
he
had
invited
her
to
visit
him
by
heaven
she
was
young
physically
and
yet
she
knew
everything
her
miraculous
youthfulness
rejuvenated
him
as
a
fact
he
was
essentially
younger
than
he
had
been
for
years
not
only
she
but
his
war
work
had
him
he
had
developed
into
a
considerable
personage
on
the
lechford
committee
he
was
chairman
of
a
he
bore
responsibilities
and
had
worries
and
for
a
climax
the
committee
had
sent
him
out
to
france
to
report
on
the
accountancy
of
the
hospitals
he
had
received
a
special
passport
he
had
had
glimpses
of
the
immense
and
growing
military
organisation
behind
the
front
he
had
chatted
in
his
fluent
and
idiomatic
french
with
authorities
military
and
civil
he
had
been
ceremoniously
complimented
on
behalf
of
his
committee
and
country
by
high
officials
of
the
service
de
santé
a
wondrous
experience
from
which
he
had
returned
to
england
with
a
greatly
increased
and
a
sharper
apprehension
of
the
significance
of
the
war
life
in
london
was
proceeding
much
as
usual
if
on
the
one
hand
the
treasury
had
startlingly
put
an
embargo
upon
capital
issues
on
the
other
hand
the
king
had
resumed
his
patronage
of
the
theatre
and
the
town
talked
of
a
new
lady
teazle
and
a
british
had
been
inaugurated
but
behind
the
thin
gauze
of
social
phenomena
now
more
and
more
realistically
perceived
and
conceived
the
dark
shape
of
the
war
as
a
vast
moving
entity
he
kept
concurrently
in
his
mind
each
in
its
place
the
most
diverse
factors
and
events
not
merely
the
flemish
and
the
french
battles
but
the
intervention
of
roumania
the
defeat
of
the
austrians
by
servia
the
menace
of
a
new
austrian
attack
on
servia
the
rise
in
prices
the
russian
move
north
of
the
vistula
the
raid
on
yarmouth
the
divulgence
of
the
german
axioms
about
frightfulness
the
rumour
of
a
definite
german
submarine
policy
the
terrible
storm
that
had
disorganised
the
entire
english
and
the
dim
distant
italian
earthquake
whose
of
thousands
had
produced
no
emotion
whatever
on
a
globe
monopolised
by
one
sole
interest
and
he
had
had
private
early
telephonic
information
of
a
naval
victory
in
the
north
sea
in
which
big
german
cruisers
had
been
chased
to
their
ignominious
lairs
and
one
sunk
christine
could
not
possibly
know
of
this
grand
affair
for
the
sunday
night
extras
were
not
yet
on
the
streets
he
had
it
ready
for
her
eagerly
waiting
to
pour
it
into
her
delicious
lap
along
with
the
inexhaustible
treasures
of
his
heart
at
that
moment
he
envisaged
the
victory
as
a
shining
jewel
specially
created
in
order
to
give
her
a
throb
of
joy
it
seems
they
picked
up
a
lot
of
survivors
from
the
he
finished
his
narration
rather
proudly
she
retorted
quietly
but
terribly
scornful
you
english
are
so
naive
why
save
them
why
not
let
them
drown
do
they
not
deserve
to
drown
look
what
they
have
done
those
boches
and
you
save
them
why
did
the
german
ships
run
away
they
had
set
a
trap
that
sees
itself
in
addition
to
being
cowards
you
save
them
and
you
think
you
have
made
a
fine
gesture
but
you
are
nothing
but
simpletons
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
inarticulate
disdain
christine
attitude
towards
the
war
was
uncomplicated
by
any
subtleties
disregarding
all
but
the
utmost
spectacular
military
events
she
devoted
her
whole
soul
to
hatred
of
the
germans
and
all
the
germans
she
believed
them
to
be
damnably
cleverer
than
any
other
people
on
earth
and
especially
than
the
english
she
believed
them
to
be
capable
of
all
villainies
whatsoever
she
believed
every
charge
brought
against
them
never
troubling
about
evidence
she
would
have
imprisoned
on
bread
and
water
all
germans
and
all
persons
with
german
names
in
england
she
was
really
shocked
by
the
transparent
idiocy
of
britons
who
opposed
the
retirement
of
prince
louis
of
battenberg
from
the
navy
for
weeks
she
had
remained
happily
in
the
delusion
that
prince
louis
had
been
shot
in
the
tower
and
when
the
awakening
came
she
had
instantly
decided
that
the
sinister
influence
of
lord
haldane
and
naught
else
must
have
saved
prince
louis
from
a
just
retribution
she
had
a
vision
of
england
as
overrun
with
innumerable
german
spies
who
moved
freely
at
inexpressible
speed
about
the
country
in
grey
automobiles
with
dazzling
headlights
while
the
marvellously
stupid
and
blind
british
police
touched
their
hats
to
them
smiled
at
her
in
silence
aware
by
experience
of
the
futility
of
argument
he
knew
quite
a
lot
of
women
who
had
almost
precisely
christine
attitude
towards
the
war
and
quite
a
lot
of
men
too
but
he
could
have
wished
the
charming
creature
to
be
as
desirable
for
her
intelligence
as
for
her
physical
and
her
strange
spiritual
charm
he
could
have
wished
her
not
to
be
providing
yet
another
specimen
of
the
phenomena
of
woman
repeating
herself
so
monotonously
in
the
various
worlds
of
london
the
simpleton
of
fifty
made
in
his
soul
an
effort
to
be
superior
and
failed
what
is
it
that
binds
me
to
her
he
reflected
imagining
himself
to
be
on
the
edge
of
a
divine
mystery
and
never
expecting
that
he
and
christine
were
the
huge
contrivances
of
certain
active
spermatozoa
for
producing
other
active
spermatozoa
christine
did
not
wonder
what
bound
her
to
she
knew
though
she
had
never
heard
such
a
word
as
spermatozoa
she
had
a
violent
passion
for
him
it
would
she
feared
be
eternal
whereas
his
passion
for
her
could
not
last
more
than
a
few
years
she
knew
what
the
passions
of
men
were
so
she
said
to
herself
superiorly
her
passion
for
him
was
in
her
smile
as
she
smiled
back
at
his
silent
smile
but
in
her
smile
there
was
also
a
convinced
apostleship
for
she
alone
was
the
repository
of
the
truth
concerning
germans
which
truth
she
preached
to
an
unheeding
world
and
there
was
something
else
in
her
baffling
smile
namely
a
quiet
resigned
resentment
against
the
richness
of
his
home
he
had
treated
her
always
with
generosity
and
at
any
rate
with
rather
more
than
fairness
he
had
not
attempted
to
conceal
that
he
was
a
man
of
means
she
had
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
financially
and
yet
she
did
reproach
him
for
having
been
too
modest
she
had
a
pretty
sure
instinct
for
the
price
of
things
and
she
knew
that
this
albany
interior
must
have
been
very
costly
further
it
displayed
what
she
deemed
to
be
the
taste
of
an
exclusive
aristocrat
she
saw
that
she
had
been
undervaluing
her
gilbert
the
proprietor
of
this
flat
would
be
entitled
to
seek
relations
of
higher
standing
than
herself
in
the
ranks
of
he
would
be
justified
in
spending
far
more
money
on
a
girl
than
he
had
spent
on
her
he
was
indeed
something
of
a
fraud
with
his
exaggerated
english
horror
of
parade
and
he
lived
by
himself
save
for
servants
he
was
utterly
free
and
yet
for
two
months
he
had
kept
her
out
of
these
splendours
prevented
her
from
basking
in
the
glow
of
these
chandeliers
and
lounging
on
these
extraordinary
sofas
and
beholding
herself
in
these
terrific
mirrors
even
now
he
was
ashamed
to
let
his
servants
see
her
was
it
altogether
nice
of
him
her
verdict
on
him
had
not
the
slightest
importance
even
for
herself
in
kissing
other
men
she
generally
kissed
him
to
cheat
her
appetite
she
was
at
his
mercy
whatever
he
was
he
was
useful
to
her
and
kind
to
her
he
might
be
the
fount
of
very
important
future
advantages
but
he
was
more
than
that
he
was
indispensable
to
her
she
walked
exploringly
into
the
little
glittering
bedroom
beneath
the
fantastic
dome
of
the
bed
the
sheets
were
turned
down
and
a
suit
of
pyjamas
laid
out
on
a
chinese
tray
on
a
lacquered
table
by
the
bed
was
a
and
kettle
and
a
box
of
matches
in
an
embroidered
case
with
one
match
sticking
out
ready
to
be
seized
and
struck
she
gazed
and
left
the
bedroom
saying
nothing
and
wandered
elsewhere
the
stairs
were
so
infinitesimal
and
dear
and
delicious
that
they
drew
from
her
a
sharp
exclamation
of
delight
she
ran
up
them
like
a
child
turned
switches
in
the
little
glittering
a
little
cold
repast
was
laid
for
two
on
an
inlaid
table
covered
with
a
sheet
of
glass
christine
gazed
saying
nothing
and
wandered
again
to
the
floor
while
hovered
attendant
she
went
to
the
vast
regency
desk
idly
fingering
papers
and
laid
hold
of
a
document
it
was
his
report
on
the
accountacy
of
the
lechford
hospitals
in
france
she
scrutinised
it
carefully
murmuring
sentences
from
it
aloud
in
her
french
accent
at
length
she
dropped
it
she
did
not
put
it
down
she
dropped
it
and
murmured
all
that
what
good
does
it
do
to
wounded
men
true
i
comprehend
nothing
of
it
i
then
she
sat
to
the
piano
whose
gorgeous
and
fantastic
case
might
well
have
intimidated
even
a
professional
musician
dare
i
she
took
off
her
gloves
as
she
began
to
play
her
best
waltz
she
looked
round
at
and
said
i
adore
thy
staircase
and
that
was
all
she
did
say
about
the
flat
still
her
demeanour
mystifying
as
it
might
be
was
benign
benevolent
with
a
remarkable
appearance
of
genuine
humility
while
she
played
discreetly
picked
up
the
telephone
and
got
the
marlborough
club
he
spoke
low
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
waltz
which
christine
in
her
nervousness
was
stumbling
over
i
want
to
speak
to
montague
ryper
yes
yes
he
is
in
the
club
i
spoke
to
him
about
an
hour
ago
and
he
is
waiting
for
me
to
ring
him
up
that
you
monty
well
dear
heart
i
find
i
sha
be
able
to
come
after
all
i
should
like
to
awfully
but
i
got
these
things
i
absolutely
must
finish
you
understand
no
no
is
she
by
jove
old
thing
when
christine
had
pettishly
banged
the
last
chord
of
the
coda
he
came
close
to
her
and
said
with
an
appreciative
smile
in
english
charming
my
little
girl
she
shook
her
head
gazing
at
the
front
of
the
piano
he
murmured
it
was
almost
a
whisper
take
your
things
off
she
looked
round
and
up
at
him
and
the
light
diffused
from
a
thousand
lustres
fell
on
her
mysterious
and
absorbed
face
my
little
rabbit
i
can
not
stay
with
thee
the
words
though
he
did
not
by
any
means
take
them
as
final
seriously
shocked
him
for
five
days
he
had
known
that
braiding
subject
to
his
convenience
was
going
down
to
bramshott
to
see
the
defender
of
the
empire
for
four
days
he
had
hesitated
whether
or
not
he
should
tell
her
that
she
might
stay
away
for
the
night
in
the
end
he
had
told
her
to
stay
away
he
had
insisted
that
she
should
stay
he
had
protested
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
look
after
himself
for
a
night
and
a
morning
she
had
gone
unwillingly
having
first
arranged
a
meal
which
he
said
he
was
to
share
with
a
friend
naturally
for
braiding
a
male
friend
she
had
wanted
him
to
dine
at
the
club
but
he
had
explained
to
braiding
that
he
would
be
busy
upon
hospital
work
and
that
another
member
of
the
committee
would
be
coming
to
help
him
the
friend
of
course
even
when
he
had
contrived
this
elaborate
and
perfect
plot
he
had
still
hesitated
about
the
bold
step
of
inviting
christine
to
the
flat
the
plan
was
extremely
attractive
but
it
held
dangers
well
he
had
invited
her
if
she
had
not
been
at
home
or
if
she
had
been
unwilling
to
come
he
would
not
have
felt
desolated
he
would
have
accepted
the
fact
as
perhaps
providential
but
she
was
at
home
she
was
willing
she
had
come
she
was
with
him
she
had
put
him
into
an
ecstasy
of
satisfaction
and
anticipation
one
evening
alone
with
her
in
his
own
beautiful
flat
what
a
frame
for
her
and
for
love
and
now
she
said
that
she
would
not
stay
it
was
incredible
it
could
not
be
permitted
but
why
not
we
are
happy
together
i
have
just
refused
a
dinner
because
of
this
did
you
hear
me
on
the
thou
wast
wrong
she
smiled
i
am
not
worth
a
dinner
it
is
essential
that
i
should
return
home
i
am
tired
tired
it
is
sunday
night
and
i
have
sworn
to
myself
that
i
will
pass
this
evening
at
home
alone
exasperating
maddening
creature
he
thought
i
fancied
i
knew
her
and
i
do
know
her
i
only
just
beginning
to
know
her
he
stared
steadily
at
her
soft
serious
worried
enchanting
face
and
tried
to
see
through
it
into
the
arcana
of
her
queer
little
brain
he
could
not
the
sweet
face
foiled
him
then
why
come
because
i
wished
to
be
nice
to
thee
to
prove
to
thee
how
nice
i
am
she
seized
her
gloves
he
saw
that
she
meant
to
go
his
demeanour
changed
he
was
aware
of
his
power
over
her
and
he
would
use
it
she
was
being
subtle
but
he
could
be
subtle
too
far
subtler
than
christine
true
he
had
not
penetrated
her
face
nevertheless
his
instinct
and
his
male
gift
of
ratiocination
informed
him
that
beneath
her
gentle
politeness
she
was
vexed
hurt
because
he
had
got
rid
of
braiding
before
receiving
her
she
had
her
feelings
and
despite
her
softness
she
could
resent
still
her
feelings
must
not
be
they
must
not
be
permitted
to
make
a
fool
of
her
he
said
rather
teasingly
but
firmly
i
know
why
she
refuses
to
stay
she
cried
plaintive
it
is
not
that
i
have
another
rendezvous
no
but
naturally
thou
thinkest
it
is
that
he
shook
his
head
not
at
all
the
little
silly
wants
to
go
back
home
because
she
finds
there
is
no
servant
here
she
is
insulted
in
her
pride
i
noticed
it
in
her
first
words
when
she
came
in
and
yet
she
ought
to
know
christine
gave
a
loud
laugh
that
really
disconcerted
him
au
revoir
my
old
one
embrace
me
she
dropped
the
veil
no
he
could
play
a
game
of
pretence
longer
than
she
could
she
moved
with
dignity
towards
the
door
but
never
would
she
depart
like
that
he
knew
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
she
was
at
the
mercy
of
her
passion
for
him
she
had
confessed
the
tyranny
of
her
passion
as
such
victims
foolishly
will
moreover
he
had
perceived
it
for
himself
he
followed
her
to
the
door
at
the
door
she
would
relent
and
sure
enough
at
the
door
she
leapt
at
him
and
clasped
his
neck
with
fierceness
and
fiercely
kissed
him
through
her
veil
and
exclaimed
bitterly
ah
thou
dost
not
love
me
but
i
love
thee
but
the
next
instant
she
had
managed
to
open
the
door
and
she
was
gone
he
sprang
out
to
the
landing
she
was
running
down
the
stone
stairs
christine
she
did
not
stop
might
be
marvellously
subtle
but
he
could
not
be
subtle
enough
to
divine
that
on
that
night
christine
happened
to
be
the
devotee
of
the
most
clement
virgin
and
that
her
demeanour
throughout
the
visit
had
been
contrived
half
unconsciously
to
enable
her
to
perform
a
deed
of
superb
and
renunciation
in
the
service
of
the
dread
goddess
he
ate
most
miserably
alone
facing
an
empty
chair
the
desolate
solitude
of
the
evening
was
terrible
he
lacked
the
force
to
go
seeking
succour
in
clubs
chapter
mascot
a
single
light
burned
in
christine
bedroom
it
stood
low
on
the
pedestal
by
the
wide
bed
and
was
heavily
shaded
so
that
only
one
half
of
the
bed
christine
half
was
exempt
from
the
general
gloom
of
the
chamber
the
officer
had
thus
ordained
things
the
white
plump
arm
of
christine
was
imprisoned
under
his
neck
he
had
ordered
that
too
he
was
asleep
christine
watched
him
on
her
return
from
the
albany
she
had
found
him
apparently
just
as
she
had
left
him
except
that
he
was
much
less
talkative
indeed
though
unswervingly
polite
even
punctilious
with
her
he
had
grown
quite
taciturn
and
very
obstinate
and
finicking
in
there
was
no
detail
as
to
which
he
did
not
formulate
a
definite
wish
yet
not
until
by
chance
her
eye
fell
on
the
whisky
decanter
did
she
perceive
that
in
her
absence
he
had
been
copiously
drinking
again
he
was
not
however
drunk
remorseful
at
her
defection
she
constituted
herself
his
slave
she
covered
him
with
acquiescences
she
drank
his
tippler
breath
and
he
was
not
particularly
responsive
he
had
all
his
own
ideas
he
ought
for
example
to
have
been
hungry
but
his
idea
was
that
he
was
not
hungry
therefore
he
had
refused
her
dishes
she
knew
him
better
now
save
on
one
subject
discussed
in
the
afternoon
he
was
a
dull
narrow
direct
man
especially
in
love
he
had
no
fancy
no
humour
no
resilience
possibly
he
worshipped
women
as
he
had
said
perhaps
devoutly
but
his
worship
of
the
individual
girl
tended
more
to
ritualism
than
to
ecstasy
the
parisian
devotee
was
thrown
away
on
him
and
she
felt
it
but
not
with
bitterness
on
the
contrary
she
liked
him
to
be
as
he
was
she
liked
to
be
herself
unappreciated
neglected
bored
she
thought
of
the
delights
which
she
had
renounced
in
the
rich
and
voluptuous
of
the
albany
she
gazed
under
the
reddish
illumination
at
the
tedious
eternal
on
which
she
exposed
her
wares
and
which
in
tottenham
court
road
went
by
the
name
of
bedstead
and
she
gathered
nausea
and
painful
longing
to
her
breast
as
the
virgin
gathered
the
swords
of
the
dolours
at
the
oratory
and
was
mystically
happy
in
the
ennui
of
serving
the
miraculous
envoy
of
the
virgin
and
when
marthe
uneasy
stole
into
the
christine
the
door
being
ajar
most
faintly
transmitted
to
her
a
command
in
french
to
tranquillise
herself
and
go
away
and
outside
a
boy
broke
the
vast
lull
of
the
sunday
night
with
a
shattering
cry
of
victory
in
the
north
sea
possibly
it
was
this
cry
that
roused
the
officer
out
of
his
doze
he
sat
up
looked
unseeing
at
christine
bright
smile
and
at
the
black
gauze
that
revealed
the
reality
of
her
youth
and
then
reached
for
his
tunic
which
hung
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
you
asked
about
my
mascot
he
said
drawing
from
a
pocket
a
small
envelope
of
oilskin
here
it
is
now
that
is
a
mascot
he
had
wakened
under
the
spell
of
his
original
theme
of
his
sole
genuine
subject
he
spoke
with
assurance
as
one
inspired
his
eyes
as
they
masterfully
encountered
christine
eyes
had
a
strange
violent
religious
expression
christine
eyes
yielded
to
his
and
her
smile
vanished
in
seriousness
he
undid
the
envelope
and
displayed
an
oval
piece
of
red
cloth
with
a
picture
of
christ
his
bleeding
heart
surrounded
by
flames
and
thorns
and
a
great
cross
in
the
background
that
said
the
officer
will
bring
anybody
safe
home
again
christine
was
too
awed
even
to
touch
the
red
cloth
the
vision
of
the
dishevelled
inspired
man
in
khaki
shirt
collar
and
tie
holding
the
magic
saviour
in
his
thin
veined
aristocratic
hand
powerfully
impressed
her
and
she
neither
moved
nor
spoke
have
you
seen
the
mascot
he
asked
she
signified
a
negative
and
then
nervously
fingered
her
gauze
no
it
a
mascot
sort
of
tiny
imp
sort
of
thing
with
a
huge
head
glittering
eyes
a
khaki
cap
of
and
crossed
legs
in
gold
and
silver
i
hear
that
tens
of
thousands
of
them
are
sold
but
there
is
nothing
like
my
mascot
where
have
you
got
it
christine
asked
in
her
queer
but
improving
english
where
did
i
get
it
just
after
mons
on
the
road
in
a
house
have
you
been
in
the
retreat
i
was
and
the
angels
have
you
seen
them
he
paused
and
then
said
with
solemnity
was
it
an
angel
i
saw
i
was
lying
doggo
by
myself
in
a
hole
and
bullets
whizzing
over
me
all
the
time
it
was
nearly
dark
and
a
figure
in
white
came
and
stood
by
the
hole
he
stood
quite
still
and
the
german
bullets
went
on
just
the
same
suddenly
i
saw
he
was
wounded
in
the
hand
it
was
bleeding
i
said
to
him
hit
in
the
hand
he
said
he
had
a
most
beautiful
voice
is
an
old
wound
it
has
reopened
lately
i
have
another
wound
in
the
other
hand
and
he
showed
me
the
other
hand
and
that
was
bleeding
too
then
the
firing
ceased
and
he
pointed
and
although
i
eaten
nothing
at
all
that
day
and
was
i
got
up
and
ran
the
way
he
pointed
and
in
five
minutes
i
ran
into
what
remained
of
my
unit
the
officer
sonorous
tones
ceased
he
shut
his
lips
tightly
as
though
clinching
the
testimony
and
the
life
of
the
bedroom
was
suspended
in
absolute
silence
that
what
saw
and
with
the
lack
of
food
my
brain
was
absolutely
clear
christine
on
her
back
trembled
the
officer
replaced
his
mascot
then
he
said
waving
the
little
bag
of
course
there
are
fellows
who
do
need
mascots
fellows
that
if
their
name
is
written
on
a
bullet
or
a
piece
of
shrapnel
it
reach
them
any
more
than
a
letter
not
addressed
to
you
would
reach
you
now
my
colonel
for
instance
it
was
he
who
told
me
how
good
my
mascot
was
well
he
can
stop
shells
turn
back
yes
he
just
got
the
and
he
said
to
me
he
said
do
deserve
it
i
got
it
by
inspiration
and
so
he
did
what
time
that
the
gilded
swiss
clock
in
the
was
striking
its
tiny
gong
nine
the
officer
looked
dully
at
his
which
not
having
been
wound
on
the
previous
night
had
inconsiderately
stopped
then
i
ca
catch
my
train
at
victoria
he
spoke
in
a
changed
voice
lifeless
and
sank
back
on
the
bed
train
what
train
nothing
only
the
leave
train
my
leave
is
up
i
ought
to
have
been
back
in
the
trenches
but
you
have
told
me
nothing
of
it
if
you
had
told
me
but
not
one
word
my
dear
when
one
is
with
a
woman
he
seemed
gloomily
and
hopelessly
to
reproach
her
chapter
the
what
your
train
but
you
can
catch
it
you
must
catch
it
he
shook
his
head
it
fate
he
muttered
bitterly
resigned
what
is
written
is
written
christine
sprang
to
the
floor
shuffled
off
the
black
gauze
in
almost
a
single
movement
and
seized
some
of
her
clothes
quick
you
shall
catch
your
train
the
clock
is
wrong
the
clock
is
too
soon
she
implored
him
with
positive
desperation
she
shook
him
and
dragged
him
energised
in
an
instant
by
the
overwhelming
idea
that
for
him
to
miss
his
train
would
be
fatal
to
him
and
to
her
also
she
could
and
did
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
mascots
against
bullets
and
shrapnel
and
bayonets
but
the
traditions
of
a
country
of
conscripts
were
ingrained
in
her
childhood
and
youth
and
she
had
not
the
slightest
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
no
matter
what
mascot
to
protect
from
the
consequences
of
indiscipline
and
already
during
her
short
career
in
london
she
had
had
good
reason
to
learn
the
sacredness
of
the
fantastic
tales
she
had
heard
of
capital
executions
for
what
seemed
trifling
laxities
tales
whispered
half
proudly
by
the
army
in
the
rooms
of
horrified
courtesans
tales
in
which
the
remote
and
ruthless
imagined
figure
of
the
grand
rivalled
that
of
god
himself
and
moreover
if
this
man
fell
into
misfortune
through
her
she
would
eternally
lose
the
grace
of
the
most
clement
virgin
who
had
confided
him
to
her
and
who
was
capable
of
terrible
revenges
she
secretly
called
on
the
virgin
nay
she
became
the
virgin
she
found
a
miraculous
strength
and
furiously
pulled
the
poor
sot
out
of
bed
the
fibres
of
his
character
had
been
soaked
away
and
she
mystically
replaced
them
with
her
own
intimidated
and
as
it
were
mesmerised
he
began
to
dress
she
rushed
as
she
was
to
the
door
marthe
marthe
madame
replied
the
fat
woman
in
alarm
run
for
a
taxi
but
madame
it
is
raining
terribly
run
for
a
taxi
turning
back
into
the
room
she
repeated
the
clock
is
too
soon
but
she
knew
that
it
was
not
nearly
nude
she
put
on
a
hat
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
do
not
worry
i
come
with
you
she
took
a
skirt
and
a
jersey
and
then
threw
a
cloak
over
everything
he
was
very
slow
he
could
find
nothing
he
could
button
nothing
she
helped
him
but
when
he
began
to
finger
his
leggings
with
the
endless
laces
and
the
innumerable
eyelets
she
snatched
them
from
him
those
in
the
taxi
she
said
but
there
is
no
taxi
there
will
be
a
taxi
i
have
sent
the
maid
at
the
last
moment
as
she
was
hurrying
him
on
to
the
staircase
she
grasped
her
handbag
they
stumbled
one
after
the
other
down
the
dark
stairs
he
had
now
caught
the
infection
of
her
tremendous
anxiety
she
opened
the
front
door
the
glistening
street
was
absolutely
empty
the
rain
pelted
on
the
pavements
and
the
roadway
each
drop
falling
like
a
missile
and
raising
a
separate
splash
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
flood
on
the
earth
was
leaping
up
to
meet
the
flood
from
the
sky
come
she
said
with
hysterical
impatience
we
can
not
wait
there
will
be
a
taxi
in
piccadilly
i
know
simultaneously
a
taxi
swerved
round
the
corner
of
burlington
street
marthe
stood
on
the
step
next
to
the
driver
as
the
taxi
halted
she
jumped
down
her
drenched
white
apron
was
over
her
head
and
she
was
wet
to
the
skin
in
the
taxi
while
the
officer
struck
matches
christine
knelt
and
fastened
his
leggings
he
could
not
have
performed
the
nice
operation
for
himself
and
all
the
time
she
was
doing
something
else
she
was
pushing
forward
the
whole
taxi
till
her
muscles
ached
with
the
effort
then
she
sat
back
on
the
seat
smoothed
her
hair
under
the
hat
unclasped
the
bag
and
patted
her
features
delicately
with
the
neither
knew
the
exact
time
and
in
vain
they
tried
to
discern
the
faces
of
clocks
that
flew
past
them
in
the
heavy
rain
christine
sighed
and
said
these
tempests
this
rain
they
say
it
is
because
of
the
big
cannons
which
break
the
clouds
the
officer
who
had
the
air
of
being
in
a
dream
suddenly
bent
towards
her
and
replied
with
a
most
strange
solemnity
it
is
to
wash
away
the
blood
she
had
not
thought
of
that
of
course
it
was
she
sighed
again
as
they
neared
victoria
the
officer
said
my
it
at
the
hotel
shall
i
have
time
to
pay
my
bill
and
get
it
the
grosvenor
next
to
the
station
you
know
she
answered
unhesitatingly
you
will
go
direct
to
the
train
i
will
try
the
hotel
drive
round
to
the
grosvenor
entrance
like
hell
he
instructed
the
driver
when
the
taxi
stopped
in
the
station
yard
in
the
hotel
she
would
never
have
got
the
bag
owing
to
her
difficulties
in
explaining
the
situation
in
english
to
a
haughty
had
not
a
waiter
been
standing
by
she
flung
imploring
french
sentences
at
the
waiter
like
a
stream
from
a
hydrant
the
bill
was
produced
in
less
than
half
a
minute
she
put
down
money
of
her
own
to
pay
for
it
for
she
had
refused
to
wait
at
the
station
while
the
officer
fished
in
the
obscurities
of
his
purse
the
bag
into
which
a
menial
had
crammed
a
kit
probably
scattered
about
the
bedroom
arrived
unfastened
once
more
at
the
station
she
gave
the
cabman
all
the
change
which
she
had
received
at
the
hotel
counter
by
a
miracle
she
made
a
porter
understand
what
was
needed
and
how
urgently
it
was
needed
he
said
the
train
was
just
going
and
ran
she
ran
after
him
the
at
the
platform
gate
allowed
the
porter
to
pass
but
raised
an
implacable
arm
to
prevent
her
from
following
she
had
no
platform
ticket
and
she
could
not
possibly
be
travelling
by
the
train
then
she
descried
her
officer
standing
at
an
open
carriage
door
in
conversation
with
another
officer
and
tapping
his
leggings
with
his
cane
how
aristocratic
and
disdainful
and
the
pair
looked
they
existed
in
a
world
utterly
different
from
hers
they
were
the
triumphant
and
negligent
males
she
endeavoured
to
direct
the
porter
with
her
pointing
hand
and
then
hysterical
again
she
screamed
out
the
one
identifying
word
she
knew
edgar
it
was
lost
in
the
resounding
echoes
of
the
immense
vault
edgar
certainly
did
not
hear
it
but
he
caught
the
great
black
initials
on
the
as
the
porter
staggered
along
and
stopped
the
aimless
man
and
the
was
thrown
into
the
apartment
doors
were
now
banging
christine
saw
edgar
take
out
his
purse
and
fumble
at
it
but
edgar
companion
pushed
edgar
into
the
train
and
himself
gave
a
tip
which
caused
the
porter
to
salute
extravagantly
the
porter
at
any
rate
had
been
rewarded
christine
began
to
cry
not
from
chagrin
but
with
relief
women
on
the
platform
waved
absurd
little
white
handkerchiefs
heads
and
khaki
shoulders
stuck
out
of
the
carriage
windows
of
the
shut
train
a
small
green
flag
waved
arms
waved
like
semaphores
the
train
ought
to
have
been
gliding
away
but
something
delayed
it
and
it
was
held
as
if
spellbound
under
the
high
dim
semicircle
of
black
glass
amid
the
noises
of
steam
the
hissing
of
electric
globes
the
horrible
rattle
of
luggage
trucks
the
patter
of
feet
and
the
vast
murmuring
gloom
christine
saw
edgar
leaning
from
a
window
and
gazing
anxiously
about
the
little
handkerchiefs
were
still
courageously
waving
and
she
too
waved
a
little
wisp
but
he
did
not
see
her
he
was
not
looking
in
the
right
place
for
her
she
thought
why
did
he
not
stay
near
the
gate
for
me
but
she
thought
again
because
he
feared
to
miss
the
train
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
close
to
his
compartment
he
knows
he
is
not
quite
sober
she
wondered
whether
he
had
any
relatives
or
any
relations
with
another
woman
he
seemed
to
be
as
solitary
as
she
was
on
the
same
side
of
the
as
herself
a
very
tall
slim
dandy
of
an
officer
was
bending
over
a
girl
smiling
at
her
and
whispering
suddenly
the
girl
turned
from
him
with
a
disdainful
toss
of
the
head
and
said
in
a
loud
clear
cockney
voice
you
ca
tell
the
tale
to
me
young
man
this
is
my
second
time
on
earth
christine
heard
the
words
but
was
completely
puzzled
the
train
moved
at
first
almost
imperceptibly
the
handkerchiefs
showed
extreme
agitation
then
a
raucous
song
floated
from
the
train
john
brown
baby
got
a
pimple
on
his
john
brown
baby
got
a
pimple
on
his
john
brown
baby
got
a
pimple
on
his
and
we
all
went
marching
home
glory
glory
alleluia
glory
glory
the
rails
showed
empty
where
the
train
had
been
and
the
sound
of
the
song
faded
and
died
some
of
the
women
were
crying
christine
felt
that
she
was
in
a
land
of
which
she
understood
nothing
but
the
tears
she
also
felt
very
cold
in
the
legs
chapter
getting
on
with
the
war
the
floors
of
the
reynolds
galleries
were
covered
with
some
hundreds
of
very
and
very
women
and
some
scores
of
men
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
loan
collection
of
drawings
and
etchings
english
and
french
but
chiefly
english
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
pictures
were
portraits
of
women
done
by
a
select
group
of
very
expensive
painters
in
the
highest
vogue
these
portraits
were
the
main
attraction
of
the
elegant
crowd
which
included
many
of
the
sitters
as
for
the
latter
they
failed
to
hide
under
an
unconvincing
mask
of
indifference
their
curiosity
as
to
their
own
effectiveness
in
a
frame
the
portraits
for
the
most
part
had
every
quality
save
that
of
sincerity
they
were
transcendantly
adroit
and
they
reeked
of
talent
they
were
luxurious
refined
sensual
titillating
exquisite
tender
compact
of
striking
poses
and
subtle
new
tones
and
while
the
heads
were
well
finished
and
instantly
recognisable
as
likenesses
the
impressionism
of
the
hands
and
of
the
provocative
draperies
showed
that
the
artists
had
fully
realised
the
necessity
of
being
modern
the
mischief
and
the
damnation
were
that
the
sitters
liked
them
because
they
produced
in
the
sitters
the
illusion
that
the
sitters
were
really
what
the
sitters
wanted
to
be
and
what
indeed
nearly
every
woman
in
the
galleries
wanted
to
be
and
the
ideal
of
the
sitters
was
a
low
ideal
the
portraits
flattered
but
only
a
few
guessed
that
they
flattered
ignobly
scarcely
any
even
of
the
artists
guessed
that
the
portraits
were
a
success
the
exhibition
was
a
success
and
all
the
people
at
the
private
view
justly
felt
that
they
were
part
of
and
contributing
to
the
success
and
though
seemingly
the
aim
of
everybody
was
to
prove
to
everybody
else
that
no
war
not
the
greatest
war
could
disturb
the
appearances
of
social
life
in
london
yet
many
were
properly
serious
and
proud
in
their
seriousness
it
was
the
autumn
of
british
troops
were
triumphantly
on
the
road
to
kut
and
british
forces
were
approaching
decisive
victory
in
gallipoli
the
russians
had
turned
on
their
pursuers
the
french
had
initiated
in
champagne
an
offensive
so
dramatic
that
it
was
regarded
as
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
the
british
on
their
left
in
the
taking
of
loos
and
hill
had
achieved
what
might
have
been
regarded
as
the
greatest
success
on
the
western
front
had
it
not
been
for
the
rumour
current
among
the
informed
personages
at
the
reynolds
galleries
that
recent
bulletins
had
been
reticent
to
the
point
of
deception
and
that
in
fact
hill
had
ceased
to
be
ours
a
week
earlier
further
zeppelins
had
raided
london
and
killed
and
wounded
numerous
londoners
and
all
present
in
the
reynolds
galleries
were
aware
from
positive
statements
in
the
newspapers
that
whereas
german
morale
was
crumbling
all
londoners
including
themselves
had
behaved
with
the
most
marvellous
stoic
calm
in
the
ordeal
of
the
zeppelins
the
assembly
had
a
further
and
particular
reason
for
serious
pride
it
was
getting
on
with
the
war
and
in
a
most
novel
way
private
views
are
customarily
views
gratis
but
the
entry
to
this
private
view
cost
a
guinea
and
there
was
absolutely
no
free
list
the
guineas
were
going
to
the
support
of
the
lechford
hospitals
in
france
the
happy
idea
was
own
and
lady
queenie
paulle
and
her
mother
had
taken
the
right
influential
measures
to
ensure
its
grandiose
execution
a
queen
had
visited
the
private
view
for
half
an
hour
thus
all
the
very
and
very
women
and
all
the
men
who
admired
and
desired
them
as
they
moved
in
voluptuous
perfection
amid
dazzling
pictures
with
the
soft
illumination
of
screened
skylights
above
and
the
reflections
in
polished
parquet
below
all
of
both
sexes
were
comfortably
conscious
of
virtue
in
the
undoubted
fact
that
they
were
helping
to
support
two
renowned
hospitals
where
at
that
very
moment
dissevered
legs
and
arms
were
being
thrown
into
buckets
in
a
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
galleries
was
a
small
but
choice
collection
of
the
etchings
of
félicien
rops
a
collection
for
connoisseurs
as
the
critics
were
to
point
out
in
the
newspapers
the
next
morning
for
rops
though
he
had
an
undeniable
partiality
for
subjects
in
which
ugly
and
prurient
women
displayed
themselves
in
nothing
but
the
inessentials
of
costume
was
a
classic
before
whom
it
was
necessary
to
bow
the
head
in
homage
was
in
this
room
in
company
with
a
young
and
handsome
staff
officer
lieutenant
molder
home
on
convalescent
leave
from
suvla
bay
molder
had
left
oxford
in
order
to
join
the
army
he
had
behaved
admirably
and
well
earned
the
red
which
pure
accident
had
given
him
he
was
a
youth
of
artistic
and
literary
tastes
with
genuine
ambitions
quite
other
than
military
and
after
a
year
of
horrible
existence
in
which
he
had
hungered
for
the
arts
more
than
for
anything
he
was
solacing
and
renewing
himself
in
the
contemplation
of
all
the
masterpieces
that
london
could
show
he
greatly
esteemed
connoisseurship
and
had
taken
him
in
hand
at
the
close
of
a
conscientious
and
highly
critical
round
of
the
galleries
they
had
at
length
reached
the
rops
room
and
they
were
discussing
every
aspect
of
rops
except
his
lubricity
when
lady
queenie
paulle
approached
them
from
behind
molder
was
the
first
to
notice
her
and
turn
he
blushed
well
queen
said
who
had
already
had
several
conversations
with
her
in
the
galleries
that
day
and
on
the
previous
days
of
preparation
she
replied
well
i
hope
you
satisfied
with
the
results
of
your
beautiful
idea
the
young
woman
slim
and
pale
had
long
since
gone
out
of
mourning
she
was
most
brilliantly
attired
and
no
detail
lacked
to
the
perfection
of
her
modish
outfit
indeed
just
as
she
was
she
would
have
made
a
marvellous
mannequin
except
for
the
fact
that
mannequins
are
not
usually
allowed
to
perfume
themselves
in
business
hours
her
thin
rather
high
voice
which
somehow
matched
her
complexion
and
carriage
had
its
customary
tone
of
amiable
insolence
and
her
tired
drooping
eyes
their
equivocal
glance
as
she
faced
the
bearded
and
grave
bachelor
and
the
handsome
muscular
boy
even
the
boy
was
older
than
queen
yet
she
seemed
to
condescend
to
them
as
if
she
were
an
immortal
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
and
could
teach
both
of
them
all
sorts
of
useful
things
about
life
nobody
could
have
guessed
from
that
serene
demeanour
that
her
was
marred
by
any
untoward
detail
whatever
yet
it
was
all
her
frocks
were
designed
to
conceal
a
serious
defect
which
seriously
disturbed
her
she
was
said
bluntly
may
i
present
mr
molder
lady
queenie
paulle
and
he
said
to
himself
secretly
annoyed
dash
the
infernal
chit
that
what
she
come
for
now
she
got
it
she
gave
the
slightest
dubious
nod
to
molder
who
having
faced
fighting
turks
with
an
equanimity
equal
to
queenie
own
was
yet
considerably
flurried
by
the
presence
and
the
gaze
of
this
legendary
girl
queenie
enjoying
his
agitation
but
affecting
to
ignore
him
began
to
talk
quickly
in
the
vein
of
exclusive
gossip
she
mentioned
in
a
few
seconds
the
topics
of
the
imminent
entry
of
bulgaria
into
the
war
the
maturing
salonika
expedition
the
confidential
terrible
utterances
of
on
recruiting
and
of
course
the
misfortune
due
to
causes
which
queenie
had
at
her
round
about
loos
then
in
regard
to
the
last
she
suddenly
added
quite
unjustifiably
implying
that
the
two
phenomena
were
connected
you
know
mother
hospitals
are
frightfully
full
just
now
but
of
course
you
do
know
why
i
so
specially
glad
such
a
success
thus
in
a
moment
and
with
no
more
than
ten
phrases
she
had
conveyed
the
suggestion
that
while
mere
soldiers
ageing
and
the
ingenuous
mass
of
the
public
might
and
did
foolishly
imagine
the
war
to
be
a
simple
affair
she
herself
by
reason
of
her
intelligence
and
her
private
sources
of
knowledge
had
a
full
unique
apprehension
of
its
extremely
complex
and
various
formidableness
resented
the
familiar
attitude
and
he
resented
queenie
very
appearance
and
the
appearance
of
the
entire
opulent
scene
in
his
head
at
that
precise
instant
were
not
only
the
statistics
of
mortality
and
major
operations
at
the
lechford
hospitals
but
also
the
astounding
desolating
tales
of
the
handsome
boy
about
folly
ignorance
stupidity
and
martyrdoms
at
suvla
he
said
with
the
peculiar
polite
restraint
that
in
him
masked
emotion
and
acrimony
yes
i
glad
it
a
success
but
the
machinery
of
it
is
perhaps
just
slightly
out
of
proportion
to
the
results
if
people
had
given
to
the
hospitals
what
they
have
spent
on
clothes
to
come
here
and
what
they
paid
painters
so
that
they
could
see
themselves
on
the
walls
we
should
have
made
twenty
times
as
much
as
we
have
made
a
hundred
times
as
much
why
good
god
queen
the
whole
afternoon
takings
would
buy
what
you
wearing
now
to
say
nothing
of
the
five
hundred
other
women
here
his
eye
rested
on
the
badge
of
her
regiment
which
she
had
had
reproduced
in
diamonds
at
this
juncture
he
heard
himself
addressed
in
a
hearty
heavy
voice
as
old
soul
an
officer
with
the
solitary
crown
on
his
sleeve
bald
stoutish
but
probably
not
more
than
touched
him
much
gentler
than
he
spoke
on
the
shoulder
craive
my
son
you
back
well
it
startling
to
see
you
at
a
anyhow
the
major
saluting
lady
queenie
as
a
distant
acquaintance
retorted
morally
you
owe
me
a
guinea
my
dear
i
called
at
the
flat
and
the
young
woman
there
told
me
you
surely
be
here
while
they
were
talking
could
hear
queenie
paulle
and
molder
where
are
you
back
from
suvla
lady
queenie
you
must
be
oozing
with
interest
and
actuality
tell
to
bring
you
to
tea
one
day
quite
quite
soon
will
you
tell
him
and
molder
murmured
something
fatuously
conventional
showed
decorously
that
he
had
caught
his
own
name
whereupon
lady
queenie
instead
of
naming
a
day
for
tea
addressed
him
almost
bitterly
what
come
over
you
what
in
the
name
of
pan
do
you
suppose
all
you
males
are
fighting
each
other
for
she
paused
effectively
good
god
if
i
began
to
dress
like
a
housemaid
the
germans
would
be
in
london
in
a
month
our
job
as
women
is
quite
delicate
enough
without
you
making
it
worse
by
any
damned
sentimental
superficiality
i
want
you
to
bring
molder
to
tea
and
if
you
ca
come
he
must
come
alone
with
a
last
strange
look
at
molder
she
retired
into
the
glitter
of
the
crowded
larger
room
she
been
driving
any
fresh
men
to
suicide
lately
major
craive
demanded
acidly
under
his
breath
raised
his
eyebrows
then
that
not
frankie
said
the
major
with
a
start
of
recognition
towards
the
staff
lieutenant
yes
sir
said
molder
they
shook
hands
at
the
previous
christmas
they
had
lain
out
together
on
the
cliffs
of
the
east
coast
in
wild
weather
waiting
to
repel
a
phantom
army
of
thirty
thousand
germans
it
was
the
red
hat
put
me
off
the
major
explained
not
my
fault
sir
molder
smiled
devilish
glad
to
see
you
my
boy
murmured
to
molder
you
do
want
to
go
and
have
tea
with
her
do
you
and
molder
answered
with
the
somewhat
fatuous
grin
that
no
amount
of
intelligence
can
keep
out
of
the
face
of
a
fellow
who
knows
that
he
has
made
an
impression
well
i
do
know
raised
his
eyebrows
again
but
with
indulgence
and
winked
at
craive
the
major
shut
his
lips
tight
then
stood
with
his
mouth
open
for
a
second
or
two
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
suddenly
receiving
the
onset
of
a
great
and
original
idea
she
right
hang
it
all
he
exclaimed
she
right
of
course
she
is
why
what
all
this
he
waved
an
arm
at
the
whole
scene
all
this
but
sex
look
at
and
look
at
their
portraits
you
going
to
tell
me
what
the
good
of
pretending
hang
it
all
when
my
own
aunt
comes
down
to
breakfast
in
a
blouse
that
would
have
given
her
fits
even
in
the
evening
ten
years
ago
and
jolly
fine
too
i
all
for
it
the
more
of
it
the
merrier
that
what
i
say
and
do
any
of
you
go
trying
to
alter
it
if
you
do
i
retire
and
you
can
defend
your
own
bally
front
craive
said
affectionately
until
you
and
queen
came
along
molder
and
i
really
thought
we
were
at
a
picture
exhibition
and
we
still
think
so
do
we
molder
the
lieutenant
nodded
now
as
you
here
just
let
me
show
you
one
or
two
things
oh
breathed
the
major
have
pity
it
not
any
canvas
woman
that
i
want
by
jove
he
caught
sight
of
an
invention
of
félicien
rops
a
pig
on
the
end
of
a
string
leading
or
being
driven
by
a
woman
who
wore
nothing
but
stockings
boots
and
a
hat
what
do
you
call
that
my
dear
fellow
that
one
of
the
most
famous
etchings
in
the
world
is
it
the
major
said
well
i
not
surprised
there
more
in
this
business
than
i
imagined
he
set
himself
to
examine
all
the
exhibits
by
rops
and
when
he
had
finished
he
turned
to
listen
here
we
going
to
make
a
night
of
it
i
decided
on
that
sorry
dear
heart
said
i
engaged
with
molder
we
shall
have
some
private
at
my
rooms
just
for
ourselves
you
ought
to
come
much
better
for
your
health
what
time
will
the
din
be
over
about
eleven
now
i
say
again
listen
here
let
talk
business
i
come
to
your
i
been
before
and
survived
and
i
come
again
but
afterwards
you
come
with
me
to
the
but
my
dear
chap
i
ca
throw
molder
out
into
vigo
street
at
eleven
protested
startled
by
the
blunt
mention
of
the
notorious
in
the
young
man
presence
naturally
you
ca
he
come
along
with
us
frankie
and
i
have
nearly
fallen
into
the
north
sea
or
german
ocean
together
have
we
frankie
it
be
my
show
and
i
turn
up
with
the
stuff
one
two
or
three
pretty
ladies
according
as
your
worship
wishes
was
now
more
than
startled
he
was
shocked
he
felt
his
cheeks
reddening
it
was
the
presence
of
molder
that
confused
him
never
had
he
talked
to
molder
on
any
subjects
but
the
arts
and
if
they
had
once
or
twice
lighted
on
the
topic
of
women
it
was
only
in
connection
with
the
arts
he
was
really
interested
in
and
admired
molder
unusual
aesthetic
intelligence
and
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
foster
it
and
he
immensely
appreciated
molder
youthful
esteem
for
himself
moreover
he
was
easily
old
enough
to
be
molder
father
it
seemed
to
him
that
though
two
generations
might
properly
mingle
in
anything
else
they
ought
not
to
mingle
in
licence
craive
crudity
was
extraordinary
see
here
craive
went
on
serious
and
determined
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
i
come
from
i
got
four
days
unexpected
i
had
to
run
down
to
my
uncle
the
old
things
would
have
died
if
i
had
i
go
back
this
is
my
last
night
i
have
had
a
scratch
up
to
now
but
my
turn
coming
you
bet
next
week
i
may
be
in
heaven
or
hell
or
anywhere
or
blind
for
life
or
without
my
legs
or
any
damn
thing
you
please
but
i
going
to
have
and
you
going
to
join
in
saw
the
look
of
simple
appeal
that
sometimes
came
into
craive
rather
ingenuous
face
he
well
knew
that
look
and
it
always
touched
him
he
remembered
certain
descriptive
letters
which
he
had
received
from
craive
at
the
front
they
corresponded
faithfully
he
could
not
have
explained
the
intimacy
of
his
relations
with
craive
they
had
begun
at
a
club
over
cards
the
two
had
little
in
common
craive
was
a
stockbroker
when
did
not
happen
to
be
in
progress
but
greatly
liked
him
because
with
all
his
crudity
he
was
such
a
decent
natural
fellow
so
so
fresh
and
unassuming
and
craive
on
his
part
had
developed
an
admiration
for
which
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
one
clue
to
the
origin
of
the
mysterious
attachment
between
them
had
been
a
naive
phrase
which
he
had
once
overheard
craive
utter
to
a
mutual
acquaintance
old
so
subtle
is
he
said
to
himself
reconsidering
the
proposal
and
why
on
earth
not
and
then
aloud
soothingly
to
craive
all
right
all
right
the
major
brightened
and
said
to
molder
you
come
of
course
oh
rather
answered
molder
quite
simply
and
again
to
himself
said
i
am
a
simpleton
the
major
pleading
and
the
spectacle
of
the
two
officers
with
their
precarious
hold
on
life
humiliated
as
well
as
touched
him
and
if
only
in
order
to
avoid
the
momentary
humiliation
he
would
have
been
well
content
to
be
able
to
roll
back
his
existence
and
to
have
had
a
military
training
and
to
be
with
them
in
the
sacred
and
proud
uniform
now
listen
here
said
the
major
about
the
aforesaid
pretty
ladies
there
they
stood
together
in
the
corner
hiding
several
of
eccentricities
ostensibly
discussing
art
charity
the
strategy
of
war
the
casualty
lists
chapter
the
call
christine
found
the
night
at
the
rather
dull
the
garish
and
tawdry
in
its
decorations
was
functioning
as
usual
the
round
tables
and
the
square
tables
the
tables
large
and
the
tables
small
were
well
occupied
with
mixed
parties
and
couples
each
table
had
its
own
yellow
illumination
and
the
upper
portion
of
the
room
with
a
certain
empty
space
in
the
centre
of
it
was
bafflingly
shadowed
between
two
high
straight
falling
curtains
could
be
seen
a
section
of
the
very
bright
against
the
curtains
with
the
figures
of
dancers
whose
bodies
seemed
to
be
glued
to
each
other
pale
to
black
or
pale
to
khaki
passing
slowly
and
rhythmically
across
the
music
over
a
sort
of
of
syncopated
surged
through
the
curtains
like
a
tide
of
the
sea
of
aphrodite
and
bathed
everyone
at
the
in
a
mysterious
aphrodisiacal
fluid
the
waiters
alone
were
insensible
to
its
influence
they
moved
to
and
fro
with
the
impassivity
and
disdain
of
eunuchs
separated
for
ever
from
the
world
temptations
loud
laughs
or
shrill
little
shrieks
exploded
at
intervals
from
the
sinister
melancholy
of
the
interior
on
christine
left
at
a
round
table
in
a
corner
sat
on
her
right
the
handsome
boy
molder
on
molder
right
miss
aida
altown
spread
her
amplitude
and
on
left
was
a
young
girl
known
to
the
company
as
alice
major
craive
the
host
the
splendid
quality
of
whose
hospitality
was
proved
by
the
flowers
the
fruit
the
bottles
the
and
the
on
the
table
sat
between
alice
and
aida
altown
the
three
women
on
principle
despised
and
scorned
each
other
with
false
warm
smiles
and
sudden
outbursts
of
compliment
christine
knew
that
the
other
two
detested
her
as
being
one
of
those
french
girls
who
under
the
protection
of
free
trade
came
to
london
and
by
their
lack
of
scruple
and
decency
took
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
nice
modest
respectable
english
girls
she
on
her
side
disdained
both
of
them
not
merely
because
they
were
courtesans
which
somehow
christine
considered
she
really
was
not
but
also
for
their
characteristic
insipidity
lackadaisicalness
and
ignorance
of
the
technique
of
the
profession
they
expected
to
be
paid
for
doing
nothing
aida
altown
she
knew
by
sight
as
belonging
to
a
great
rival
promenade
aida
had
reached
the
purgatory
of
obesity
which
christine
always
feared
despite
the
largeness
of
her
mass
she
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
the
english
manner
blonde
soft
idle
without
a
trace
of
temperament
and
incomparably
dull
and
stupid
but
she
was
ageing
she
had
been
favourably
known
in
the
west
end
continuously
save
for
a
brief
escapade
in
new
york
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
century
she
was
at
the
period
when
such
as
she
realise
with
flaccid
alarm
that
they
have
no
future
and
when
they
are
ready
to
risk
grave
imprudences
for
youths
who
feel
flattered
by
their
extreme
maturity
christine
gazed
calmly
at
her
supercilious
and
secure
in
the
immense
advantage
of
at
least
fifteen
years
to
the
good
and
if
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
aida
for
being
too
old
christine
did
the
same
at
alice
for
being
too
young
alice
was
truly
a
girl
probably
not
more
than
seventeen
her
pert
pretty
infantile
face
was
an
outrage
against
the
code
she
was
a
mere
amateur
with
everything
to
learn
absurdly
presuming
upon
the
very
quality
which
would
vanish
first
and
she
was
a
fool
she
obviously
had
no
sense
not
even
the
beginnings
of
sense
she
was
wearing
an
impudently
expensive
frock
which
must
have
cost
quite
five
times
as
much
as
christine
own
though
the
latter
in
the
opinion
of
the
wearer
was
by
far
the
more
authentically
and
she
talked
proudly
at
large
about
her
losses
on
the
turf
and
of
the
swindles
practised
upon
her
christine
admitted
that
the
girl
could
make
plenty
of
money
and
would
continue
to
make
money
for
a
long
long
time
bar
accidents
but
her
final
conclusion
about
alice
was
she
will
end
on
straw
the
supper
was
over
the
conversation
had
never
been
vivacious
and
now
it
was
in
champagne
the
girls
had
wanted
to
hear
about
the
war
but
the
major
who
had
arrived
in
a
rather
dogmatic
mood
put
an
absolute
ban
on
shop
alice
had
then
kept
the
talk
such
as
it
was
upon
her
favourite
topic
revues
she
was
an
encyclopaedia
of
knowledge
concerning
revues
past
present
and
to
come
she
had
once
indeed
figured
for
a
few
grand
weeks
in
a
revue
chorus
thereby
acquiring
unique
status
in
her
world
the
topic
palled
upon
both
aida
and
christine
and
christine
had
said
to
herself
they
are
aware
of
nothing
those
two
for
aida
and
alice
had
proved
to
be
equally
and
utterly
ignorant
of
the
superlative
social
event
of
the
afternoon
the
private
view
at
the
reynolds
galleries
at
which
indeed
christine
had
not
assisted
but
of
which
she
had
learnt
all
the
intimate
details
from
what
christine
demanded
be
done
with
such
a
pair
of
ninnies
she
might
have
been
excused
for
abandoning
all
attempt
to
behave
as
a
woman
of
the
world
should
at
a
supper
party
nevertheless
she
continued
and
conscientiously
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
to
charm
to
divert
and
to
enliven
after
all
the
ladies
were
there
to
captivate
the
males
and
if
aida
and
alice
dishonestly
flouted
obligations
christine
would
not
she
would
at
any
rate
show
them
how
to
behave
she
especially
attended
to
who
having
drunk
little
was
taciturn
and
preoccupied
in
his
amiabilities
she
divined
that
something
was
the
matter
but
she
could
not
divine
that
his
thoughts
were
saddened
by
the
recollection
at
the
of
the
lovely
music
which
he
had
heard
earlier
in
his
and
by
the
memory
of
the
letters
and
of
what
the
major
had
said
at
the
reynolds
galleries
about
the
past
and
the
possibilities
of
the
future
the
major
was
very
benevolently
intoxicated
and
at
short
intervals
he
raised
his
glass
to
who
did
not
once
fail
to
respond
with
an
affectionate
smile
which
christine
had
never
before
seen
on
face
suddenly
alice
who
had
been
lounging
with
an
extinct
cigarette
in
her
jewelled
fingers
sat
up
and
said
in
the
uncertain
voice
of
an
inexperienced
girl
who
has
ceased
to
count
the
number
of
glasses
emptied
shall
i
recite
i
been
trained
you
know
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
she
stood
and
recited
with
a
surprisingly
correct
and
sure
pronunciation
of
difficult
words
to
show
that
she
had
in
fact
received
some
training
helen
thy
beauty
is
to
me
like
those
nicean
barks
of
yore
that
gently
a
perfumed
sea
the
weary
wayworn
wanderer
bore
to
his
own
native
shore
on
desperate
seas
long
wont
to
roam
thy
hyacinth
hair
thy
classic
face
thy
naiad
airs
have
brought
me
home
to
the
glory
that
was
greece
to
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
lo
in
your
brilliant
window
niche
how
i
see
thee
stand
the
agate
lamp
within
thy
hand
ah
psyche
from
the
regions
which
are
holy
land
the
uncomprehended
marvellous
poem
having
startled
the
whole
room
ceased
and
the
resumed
its
sway
a
drunken
bravo
came
from
one
table
a
cheer
from
another
young
alice
nodded
an
acknowledgment
and
sank
loosely
into
her
chair
exhausted
by
her
last
effort
against
the
spell
of
champagne
and
liqueurs
and
the
naive
big
major
bewitched
by
the
child
subsided
into
soft
contact
with
her
and
they
almost
tearfully
embraced
a
waiter
sedately
replaced
a
glass
which
alice
drooping
negligent
hand
had
and
wiped
the
cloth
was
silent
the
whole
table
was
silent
de
la
grande
asked
christine
of
who
did
not
reply
christine
though
she
condemned
alice
as
now
disgusting
had
been
taken
aback
and
in
spite
of
herself
much
impressed
by
the
surprising
display
of
elocution
said
molder
in
his
clipped
oxford
french
two
couples
from
other
tables
were
dancing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
molder
demanded
leaning
towards
her
i
say
do
you
dance
but
certainly
said
christine
i
learnt
at
the
convent
and
she
spoke
of
her
convent
education
a
triumphant
subject
with
her
though
she
had
actually
spent
less
than
a
year
in
the
convent
after
a
few
moments
they
both
rose
and
christine
bending
over
whispered
lovingly
in
his
ear
dear
thou
wilt
not
be
jealous
if
i
dance
one
turn
with
thy
young
friend
she
was
addressing
the
wrong
person
already
throughout
the
supper
aida
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
whole
structure
of
civilised
society
is
based
on
the
rule
that
at
a
meal
a
man
must
talk
first
to
the
lady
on
his
right
and
then
to
the
lady
on
his
left
and
so
on
infinitely
had
secretly
taken
exception
to
the
periodic
intercourse
and
particularly
the
intercourse
in
french
between
christine
and
molder
who
was
officially
hers
that
these
two
should
go
off
and
dance
together
was
the
supreme
insult
to
her
by
she
had
not
sufficient
physical
command
of
herself
christine
felt
that
molder
would
have
danced
better
two
hours
earlier
but
still
he
danced
beautifully
their
bodies
fitted
like
two
parts
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
that
have
discovered
each
other
she
realised
that
was
and
regret
tinctured
the
ecstasy
of
the
dance
then
suddenly
she
heard
a
loud
imploring
cry
in
her
ear
christine
she
looked
round
pale
still
dancing
but
only
by
inertia
nobody
was
near
her
the
four
people
at
the
major
table
gave
no
sign
of
agitation
or
even
of
interest
the
major
still
had
alice
more
or
less
in
his
arms
what
was
that
she
asked
wildly
what
was
what
said
molder
at
a
loss
to
understand
her
extraordinary
demeanour
and
she
heard
the
cry
again
and
then
again
christine
christine
she
recognised
the
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
the
officer
whom
she
had
taken
to
victoria
station
one
sunday
night
months
and
months
ago
excuse
me
she
said
slipping
from
molder
hold
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
to
the
ladies
got
her
wraps
and
ran
past
the
watchful
guardian
through
the
dark
dubious
portico
of
the
club
into
the
street
the
thing
was
done
in
a
moment
and
why
she
did
it
she
could
not
tell
she
knew
simply
that
she
must
do
it
and
that
she
was
under
the
dominion
of
those
unseen
powers
in
whom
she
had
always
believed
she
forgot
the
as
completely
as
though
it
had
been
a
phenomenon
with
her
chapter
the
soldier
but
outside
she
lost
faith
half
a
dozen
were
slumbering
in
a
row
near
the
door
of
the
and
they
all
stirred
monstrously
yet
scarcely
perceptibly
at
the
sight
of
the
figure
solitary
fragile
and
pale
in
the
darkness
they
seemed
for
an
instant
to
lust
for
her
and
then
recognising
that
she
was
not
their
prey
to
sink
back
into
the
torpor
of
their
inexhaustible
patience
the
sight
of
them
was
prejudicial
to
the
dominion
of
the
unseen
powers
christine
admitted
to
herself
that
she
had
drunk
a
lot
that
she
was
demented
that
her
only
proper
course
was
to
return
dutifully
to
the
she
wondered
what
if
she
did
not
so
return
she
could
possibly
say
to
justify
herself
to
nevertheless
she
went
on
down
the
street
hurrying
automatic
and
reached
the
main
thoroughfare
it
was
dark
with
the
new
protective
darkness
the
central
hooded
lamps
showed
like
poor
candles
making
a
series
of
rings
of
feeble
illumination
on
the
vast
invisible
floor
of
the
road
nobody
was
afoot
not
a
soul
the
last
of
the
that
went
about
killing
and
maiming
people
in
the
new
protective
darkness
had
long
since
reached
its
yard
the
seductive
dim
violet
bulbs
were
all
extinguished
on
the
entrances
of
the
theatres
and
save
for
a
thread
of
light
at
some
lofty
window
here
and
there
the
curving
facades
of
the
street
were
as
undecipherable
as
the
heavens
above
or
as
the
asphalte
beneath
then
christine
ear
detected
a
faint
roar
it
grew
louder
it
became
terrific
and
a
long
succession
of
huge
loaded
army
waggons
with
peering
thundered
past
at
full
speed
one
close
behind
the
next
shaking
the
very
avenue
the
slightest
misjudgment
by
the
leading
waggon
in
the
confusion
of
light
and
darkness
and
the
whole
convoy
would
have
pitched
itself
together
in
a
mass
of
iron
flesh
blood
and
ordnance
but
the
convoy
went
ruthlessly
and
safely
forward
till
its
final
red
swung
round
a
corner
and
vanished
the
avenue
ceased
to
shake
the
thunder
died
away
and
there
was
silence
again
whence
and
why
the
convoy
came
and
at
whose
dread
omnipotent
command
whither
it
was
bound
what
it
carried
no
answer
in
the
darkness
to
these
enigmas
and
christine
was
afraid
of
england
she
remembered
people
in
ostend
saying
that
england
would
never
go
to
war
she
too
had
said
it
bitterly
and
now
she
was
in
the
midst
of
the
unmeasured
city
which
had
darkened
itself
for
war
and
she
was
afraid
of
an
unloosed
might
what
madness
was
she
doing
she
did
not
even
know
the
man
name
she
knew
only
that
he
was
edgar
she
would
have
liked
to
be
his
according
to
the
french
custom
but
he
had
never
written
to
her
he
was
still
in
her
debt
for
the
hotel
bill
and
the
taxi
fare
he
had
not
even
kissed
her
at
the
station
she
tried
to
fancy
that
she
heard
his
voice
calling
christine
with
frantic
supplication
in
her
ears
but
she
could
not
she
turned
into
another
side
street
and
saw
a
lighted
doorway
two
soldiers
were
standing
in
the
veiled
radiance
she
could
just
read
the
lower
half
of
the
painted
notice
all
service
men
welcome
beds
meals
writing
and
reading
rooms
always
open
she
passed
on
one
of
the
soldiers
a
officer
of
mature
years
solemnly
winked
at
her
without
moving
an
unnecessary
muscle
she
looked
modestly
down
twenty
yards
further
on
she
described
near
a
a
tall
soldier
whose
somewhat
bent
body
seemed
to
be
clustered
over
with
pots
pans
tins
bags
valises
satchels
and
weapons
like
the
figure
of
some
military
father
christmas
on
his
surreptitious
rounds
she
knew
that
he
must
be
a
poor
benighted
fellow
just
back
from
the
trenches
he
was
staring
up
at
the
place
where
the
ought
to
have
been
he
glanced
at
her
and
said
in
a
fatigued
gloomy
aristocratic
voice
pardon
me
madam
is
this
denman
street
i
want
to
find
the
denman
hostel
christine
looked
into
his
face
a
sacred
dew
suffused
her
from
head
to
foot
she
trembled
with
an
intimidated
joy
she
felt
the
mystic
influences
of
all
the
unseen
powers
she
knew
herself
with
holy
dread
to
be
the
chosen
of
the
very
clement
virgin
and
the
channel
of
a
miraculous
intervention
it
was
the
most
marvellous
sweetest
thing
that
had
ever
happened
it
was
humanly
incredible
but
it
had
happened
is
it
you
she
murmured
in
a
soft
breaking
voice
the
man
stooped
and
examined
her
face
she
said
while
he
gazed
at
her
edgar
see
the
wrist
watch
and
held
up
her
arm
from
which
the
wide
sleeve
of
her
mantle
slipped
away
and
the
man
said
is
it
you
she
said
come
with
me
i
will
look
after
you
the
man
answered
glumly
i
have
no
money
at
least
not
enough
for
you
and
i
owe
you
a
lot
of
money
already
you
are
an
angel
i
ashamed
what
do
you
mean
christine
protested
do
you
forget
that
you
gave
me
a
note
it
was
more
than
enough
to
pay
the
hotel
as
for
the
rest
let
us
not
speak
of
it
come
with
me
did
i
muttered
the
man
she
could
feel
the
very
clement
virgin
smiling
approval
of
her
fib
it
was
exactly
such
a
fib
as
the
virgin
herself
would
have
told
in
a
quandary
of
charity
and
when
a
taxi
came
round
the
corner
she
knew
that
the
virgin
disguised
as
a
was
steering
it
and
she
hailed
it
with
a
firm
and
yet
loving
gesture
the
taxi
stopped
she
opened
the
door
and
in
her
sombre
mantle
and
bright
trailing
frock
and
glinting
pale
shoes
she
got
in
and
the
military
father
christmas
with
much
difficulty
and
jingling
and
clinking
insinuated
himself
after
her
into
the
vehicle
and
banged
to
the
door
and
at
the
same
moment
one
of
the
soldiers
from
the
hostel
ran
up
here
mate
what
do
you
want
to
take
his
money
from
him
for
you
damned
w
but
the
taxi
drove
off
christine
had
not
understood
and
had
she
understood
she
would
not
have
cared
she
had
a
divine
mission
she
was
in
bliss
you
did
not
seem
surprised
to
meet
me
she
said
taking
rough
hand
no
had
you
called
out
my
name
no
you
are
sure
yes
perhaps
you
were
thinking
of
me
i
was
thinking
of
you
perhaps
i
do
know
but
i
never
surprised
you
must
be
very
tired
yes
but
why
are
you
like
that
all
these
things
you
are
not
an
officer
now
no
i
had
to
resign
my
commission
just
after
i
saw
you
he
paused
and
added
drily
whisky
his
deep
rich
voice
filled
the
taxi
with
the
resigned
philosophy
of
fatalism
and
then
of
course
i
joined
up
again
at
once
he
said
casually
i
soon
got
out
to
the
front
now
i
on
leave
that
mere
luck
she
burst
into
tears
she
was
so
touched
by
his
curt
story
and
by
the
grotesquerie
of
his
appearance
in
the
faint
light
from
the
exterior
lamp
which
lit
the
dial
of
the
taximeter
that
she
lost
control
of
herself
and
the
man
gave
a
sob
or
possibly
it
was
only
a
gulp
to
hide
a
sob
and
she
leaned
against
him
in
her
thin
garments
and
he
clinked
and
jingled
and
his
breath
smelt
of
beer
chapter
the
ring
the
flat
was
in
darkness
except
for
the
little
lamp
by
the
bedside
the
soldier
lay
asleep
in
his
flannel
shirt
in
the
wide
bed
and
christine
lay
awake
next
him
his
clothes
were
heaped
on
a
chair
his
eighty
pounds
weight
of
kit
were
deposited
in
a
corner
of
the
on
the
table
in
the
were
the
remains
of
a
meal
christine
was
thinking
carelessly
and
without
apprehension
of
what
she
should
say
to
she
would
tell
him
that
she
had
suddenly
felt
unwell
no
that
would
be
silly
she
would
tell
him
that
he
really
had
not
the
right
to
ask
her
to
meet
such
women
as
aida
and
alice
had
he
no
respect
for
her
or
she
would
tell
him
that
aida
had
obviously
meant
to
attack
her
and
that
the
dance
with
lieutenant
molder
was
simply
a
device
to
enable
her
to
get
away
quietly
and
avoid
all
scandal
in
a
resort
where
scandal
was
intensely
deprecated
she
could
tell
him
fifty
things
and
he
would
have
to
accept
whatever
she
chose
to
tell
him
she
was
mystically
happy
in
the
incomparable
marvel
of
the
miracle
and
in
her
care
of
the
dull
unresponding
man
her
heart
yearned
thankfully
devotedly
passionately
to
the
virgin
of
the
vii
dolours
in
the
profound
nocturnal
silence
broken
only
by
the
man
slow
regular
breathing
she
heard
a
sudden
ring
it
was
the
bell
ringing
in
the
kitchen
the
bell
rang
again
and
again
obstinately
party
was
over
then
and
he
had
arrived
to
make
inquiries
she
smiled
and
did
not
move
after
a
few
moments
she
could
hear
marthe
stirring
she
sprang
up
and
then
cunningly
considerate
slipped
from
under
the
as
noiselessly
and
as
smoothly
as
a
snake
so
that
the
man
should
not
be
disturbed
the
two
women
met
in
the
little
hall
christine
in
the
immodesty
of
a
lacy
and
diaphanous
garment
and
marthe
in
a
coarse
cotton
nightgown
covered
with
a
shawl
the
bell
rang
once
more
loudly
close
to
their
ears
are
you
mad
christine
whispered
with
fierceness
go
back
to
bed
let
him
ring
chapter
the
return
it
was
afternoon
in
april
rang
the
right
bell
at
the
entrance
of
the
london
home
of
the
lechfords
lechford
house
designed
about
by
an
englishman
of
genius
who
in
this
rare
instance
had
found
a
patron
with
the
wit
to
let
him
alone
was
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
domestic
architecture
in
the
west
end
inspired
by
the
formidable
palaces
of
rome
and
florence
the
artist
had
conceived
a
building
in
the
style
of
the
italian
renaissance
but
modified
softened
chastened
civilised
to
express
the
bland
and
yet
haughty
sobriety
of
the
english
climate
and
the
english
peerage
people
without
an
eye
for
the
perfect
would
have
correctly
described
it
as
a
large
plain
house
in
grey
stone
of
three
storeys
with
a
width
of
four
windows
on
either
side
of
its
black
front
door
a
jutting
cornice
and
rather
elaborate
chimneys
it
was
however
a
masterpiece
for
the
connoisseur
and
foreign
architects
sometimes
came
with
cards
of
admission
to
pry
into
it
professionally
the
blinds
of
its
principal
windows
were
down
not
because
of
the
war
they
were
often
down
for
at
least
four
other
houses
disputed
with
lechford
house
the
honour
of
sheltering
the
marquis
and
his
wife
and
their
sole
surviving
child
above
the
roof
a
wire
platform
for
the
catching
of
bombs
had
given
the
mansion
a
somewhat
ridiculous
appearance
but
otherwise
lechford
house
managed
to
look
as
though
it
had
never
heard
of
the
european
war
one
half
of
the
black
entrance
swung
open
and
a
gentleman
dressed
like
lord
lechford
stockbroker
but
who
was
in
reality
his
butler
said
in
answer
to
enquiry
lady
queenie
is
not
at
home
sir
but
it
is
five
protested
suddenly
sick
of
impudent
unreliability
and
i
have
an
appointment
with
her
at
five
the
butler
face
relaxed
ever
so
little
from
its
occupational
inhumanity
of
a
suet
pudding
the
spirit
of
compassion
seemed
to
inform
it
for
an
instant
her
ladyship
went
out
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
sir
when
think
she
be
back
the
suet
pudding
was
restored
that
i
could
not
say
sir
damn
the
girl
said
to
himself
and
aloud
please
tell
her
ladyship
that
i
called
hoape
is
it
not
sir
it
is
by
the
force
of
his
raisin
eyes
the
butler
held
as
he
turned
to
descend
the
steps
there
nobody
at
home
sir
except
carlos
smith
carlos
smith
is
in
lady
queenie
apartments
carlos
smith
exclaimed
who
had
not
seen
concepcion
for
some
seventeen
months
nor
heard
from
her
for
nearly
as
long
nor
heard
of
her
since
the
previous
year
yes
sir
ask
her
if
she
can
see
me
will
you
said
impetuously
after
a
slight
pause
he
stepped
on
to
the
tessellated
pavement
of
the
outer
hall
on
the
raised
tessellated
pavement
of
the
inner
hall
stood
two
meditative
youngish
footmen
possibly
musing
upon
the
problems
of
the
intensification
of
the
military
service
act
which
were
then
exciting
journalists
and
statesmen
beyond
was
the
renowned
staircase
which
rising
with
insubstantial
grace
lost
itself
in
silvery
altitude
like
the
way
to
heaven
presently
was
mounting
the
staircase
and
passing
statues
by
canova
and
thorwaldsen
and
portraits
of
which
the
heads
had
been
painted
by
lawrence
and
the
hands
and
draperies
by
lawrence
hireling
and
huger
canvasses
on
which
the
heads
and
breasts
had
been
painted
by
rubens
and
everything
else
by
regiment
of
hirelings
the
guiding
footman
preceded
him
through
a
great
chamber
which
he
recognised
as
the
in
its
winding
sheet
and
then
up
a
small
and
insignificant
staircase
and
was
on
ground
strange
to
him
for
never
till
then
had
he
been
higher
than
the
in
lechford
house
lady
queenie
apartments
did
violence
to
sensibilities
as
an
upholder
of
traditionalism
in
all
the
arts
of
the
theory
that
every
sound
movement
in
any
art
must
derive
from
its
predecessor
some
months
earlier
he
had
met
for
a
few
minutes
the
creative
leader
of
the
newest
development
in
internal
decoration
and
he
vividly
remembered
a
saying
of
the
man
at
the
present
day
the
only
people
in
the
world
with
really
vital
perceptions
about
decoration
are
african
niggers
and
the
only
inspiring
productions
are
the
coloured
cotton
stuffs
designed
for
the
african
native
market
the
remark
had
amused
and
stimulated
him
but
he
had
never
troubled
to
go
in
search
of
examples
of
the
inspiring
influence
of
african
taste
on
london
domesticity
he
now
saw
perhaps
the
supreme
instance
lodged
in
lechford
house
like
a
new
and
truculent
state
within
a
great
empire
lady
queenie
had
imposed
terms
on
her
family
and
under
threats
of
rupture
of
separation
of
scandal
lady
queenie
exotic
nest
had
come
into
existence
in
the
very
fortress
of
unchangeable
british
convention
the
phenomenon
was
a
war
phenomenon
due
to
the
war
begotten
by
the
war
for
lady
queenie
had
said
that
if
she
was
to
do
without
disaster
to
her
sanity
she
must
have
the
right
environment
thus
the
putting
together
of
lady
queenie
nest
had
proceeded
concurrently
with
the
building
of
national
projectile
factories
and
of
square
miles
of
offices
for
the
girl
clerks
of
ministries
and
departments
of
government
the
footman
left
alone
in
a
room
designated
the
boudoir
resented
the
boudoir
because
it
was
like
nothing
that
he
had
ever
witnessed
the
walls
were
irregularly
covered
with
rhombuses
rhomboids
lozenges
diamonds
triangles
and
parallelograms
the
carpet
was
treated
likewise
and
also
the
upholstery
and
the
cushions
the
colourings
of
the
scene
in
their
excessive
brightness
crudity
and
variety
surpassed
conception
of
the
possible
he
had
learned
the
value
of
colour
before
queen
was
born
and
in
the
albany
had
translated
principle
into
practice
but
the
hues
of
the
boudoir
made
the
gaudiest
effects
of
regency
furniture
appear
sombre
the
place
resembled
a
gigantic
and
glittering
kaleidoscope
deranged
and
arrested
glance
ran
round
the
room
like
a
hunted
animal
seeking
escape
and
found
no
escape
he
was
as
disturbed
as
he
might
have
been
disturbed
by
drinking
a
liqueur
on
the
top
of
a
cocktail
nevertheless
he
had
to
admit
that
some
of
the
contrasts
of
pure
colour
were
rather
beautiful
even
impressive
and
he
hated
to
admit
it
he
was
aware
of
a
terrible
apprehension
that
he
would
never
be
the
same
man
again
and
that
henceforth
his
own
abode
would
be
eternally
stricken
for
him
with
the
curse
of
insipidity
regaining
somewhat
his
nerve
he
looked
for
pictures
there
were
no
pictures
but
every
piece
of
furniture
was
painted
with
primitive
sketches
of
human
figures
or
of
flowers
or
of
vessels
or
of
animals
on
the
front
of
the
mantelpiece
were
perversely
but
brilliantly
depicted
with
a
high
degree
of
finish
two
nude
crouching
women
who
gazed
longingly
at
each
other
across
the
impassable
semicircular
abyss
of
the
fireplace
and
just
above
their
heads
on
a
scroll
ran
these
words
the
ways
of
god
are
strange
he
heard
movements
and
a
slight
cough
in
the
next
room
the
door
leading
to
which
was
ajar
concepcion
cough
he
thought
he
recognised
it
five
minutes
ago
he
had
had
no
notion
of
seeing
her
now
he
was
about
to
see
her
and
he
felt
excited
and
troubled
as
much
by
the
sudden
violence
of
life
as
by
the
mere
prospect
of
the
meeting
after
her
husband
death
concepcion
had
soon
withdrawn
from
london
a
large
engineering
firm
on
the
clyde
one
of
the
heads
of
which
happened
to
be
constitutionally
a
pioneer
was
establishing
a
canteen
for
its
workmen
and
concepcion
the
tentacles
of
whose
influence
would
stretch
to
any
length
had
decided
that
she
ought
to
take
up
canteen
work
and
in
particular
the
canteen
work
of
just
that
firm
but
first
of
all
to
strengthen
her
prestige
and
acquire
new
prestige
she
had
gone
to
the
united
states
with
a
powerful
introduction
to
sears
roebuck
and
company
of
chicago
in
order
to
study
industrial
canteenism
in
its
most
advanced
and
intricate
manifestations
portraits
of
concepcion
in
splendid
furs
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
in
the
act
of
preparing
to
study
industrial
canteenism
in
its
most
advanced
and
intricate
manifestations
had
appeared
in
the
illustrated
weeklies
the
luxurious
trip
had
cost
several
hundreds
of
pounds
but
it
was
war
expenditure
and
moreover
concepcion
had
come
into
considerable
sums
of
money
through
her
deceased
husband
her
return
to
britain
had
never
been
published
advertisements
of
concepcion
ceased
only
a
few
friends
knew
that
she
was
in
the
most
active
retirement
on
the
clyde
had
written
to
her
twice
but
had
obtained
no
replies
one
fact
he
knew
that
she
had
not
had
a
child
lady
queenie
had
not
mentioned
her
it
was
understood
that
the
inseparables
had
quarrelled
in
the
heroic
manner
and
separated
for
ever
she
entered
the
boudoir
slowly
grew
as
it
were
because
she
was
still
the
martyr
of
destiny
and
he
was
not
she
wore
a
gown
of
queen
he
knew
it
was
queen
because
he
had
seen
precisely
such
a
gown
on
queen
and
there
could
not
possibly
be
another
gown
precisely
like
that
very
challenging
gown
it
suited
queen
but
it
did
not
suit
concepcion
she
looked
older
she
was
and
might
have
been
taken
for
she
was
very
pale
with
immense
fatigued
eyes
but
her
ridiculous
nose
had
preserved
all
its
originality
and
she
had
the
same
slightly
masculine
air
perhaps
somewhat
intensified
with
an
added
dignity
and
thought
she
is
as
mysterious
and
unfathomable
as
i
am
myself
and
he
was
impressed
and
perturbed
with
a
faint
sardonic
smile
glancing
at
him
as
a
physical
equal
from
her
unusual
height
she
was
as
tall
as
lady
queenie
she
said
abruptly
and
casually
am
i
changed
no
he
replied
as
abruptly
and
casually
clasping
almost
inimically
her
ringed
hand
she
was
wearing
queenie
rings
but
you
tired
the
journey
i
suppose
it
not
that
we
sat
up
till
five
this
morning
talking
who
queen
and
i
what
did
you
do
that
for
well
you
see
we
had
the
devil
own
row
she
stopped
leaving
his
imagination
to
complete
the
picture
of
the
meeting
and
the
night
talk
he
smiled
awkwardly
tried
to
be
paternal
and
failed
what
about
she
never
wanted
me
to
leave
london
i
came
back
last
night
with
only
a
handbag
just
as
she
was
going
out
to
dinner
she
did
go
out
to
dinner
queen
is
a
white
woman
nobody
knows
how
white
queen
is
i
did
know
myself
until
last
night
there
was
a
pause
said
i
had
an
appointment
here
with
the
white
woman
on
business
yes
i
know
said
concepcion
negligently
she
be
home
soon
something
infinitesimally
malicious
in
the
voice
and
gaze
sent
the
singular
idea
shooting
through
his
mind
that
queen
had
gone
out
on
purpose
so
that
concepcion
might
have
him
alone
for
a
while
and
he
was
wary
of
both
of
them
as
he
might
have
been
of
two
pagan
goddesses
whom
he
a
poor
defiant
mortal
suspected
of
having
laid
an
eye
on
him
for
their
own
ends
changed
anyhow
said
concepcion
older
no
harder
he
was
startled
not
displeased
how
harder
more
sure
of
yourself
said
concepcion
with
a
trace
of
the
old
harsh
egotism
in
her
tone
it
appears
you
a
perfect
tyrant
on
the
lechford
committee
now
you
and
all
the
more
footling
members
dread
the
days
when
you
in
the
chair
it
appears
also
that
you
really
overthrown
two
chairmen
and
yet
wo
take
the
situation
yourself
he
was
still
more
startled
but
now
positively
flattered
by
the
world
estimate
of
his
activities
and
individuality
he
saw
himself
in
a
new
light
this
what
you
were
talking
about
until
five
the
butler
entered
shall
i
serve
tea
madam
concepcion
looked
at
the
man
scornfully
yes
one
of
the
minor
stalwarts
entered
and
arranged
a
table
and
the
other
followed
with
a
glittering
steaming
tray
in
his
hands
while
the
butler
hovered
like
a
winged
hippopotamus
over
the
operation
concepcion
half
sat
down
by
the
table
and
then
altering
her
mind
dropped
on
to
a
vast
as
wide
as
a
bed
and
covered
with
as
many
cushions
as
would
have
stocked
a
cushion
shop
which
occupied
the
principal
place
in
front
of
the
hearth
the
hem
of
her
rich
gown
just
touched
the
floor
could
see
that
she
was
wearing
the
transparent
stockings
that
queen
wore
with
the
transparent
lavender
gown
her
right
shoulder
rose
high
from
the
mass
of
the
body
and
her
head
was
sunk
between
two
cushions
her
voice
came
smothered
from
the
cushions
damn
it
do
look
at
me
like
that
he
was
standing
near
the
mantelpiece
why
he
exclaimed
what
the
matter
con
there
was
no
answer
he
lit
a
cigarette
the
ebullient
kettle
kept
lifting
its
lid
in
growing
impatience
but
concepcion
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
tea
had
a
thought
distinct
like
a
bubble
on
a
sea
of
thoughts
that
if
the
tea
was
already
made
as
no
doubt
it
was
it
would
soon
be
stewed
concepcion
said
the
matter
is
that
i
a
ruined
woman
and
queen
ca
understand
and
in
the
bewildering
voluptuous
brightness
and
luxury
of
the
room
had
the
sensation
of
being
a
poor
baffled
ghost
groping
in
the
night
of
existence
concepcion
left
arm
slipped
over
the
edge
of
the
and
hung
limp
and
pale
the
curved
fingers
touching
the
carpet
chapter
the
clyde
she
was
sitting
up
on
the
and
had
poured
out
the
tea
he
had
pushed
the
towards
the
and
she
was
talking
in
an
ordinary
tone
just
as
though
she
had
not
immodestly
bared
her
spirit
to
him
and
as
though
she
knew
not
that
he
realised
she
had
done
so
she
was
talking
at
length
as
one
who
in
the
past
had
been
well
accustomed
to
giving
monologues
and
to
holding
in
subjection
while
she
chattered
and
to
making
feel
glad
that
they
had
consented
to
subjection
she
was
saying
you
no
idea
what
the
valley
of
the
clyde
is
now
you
ca
have
it
filled
with
girls
and
they
come
into
it
every
morning
by
train
to
huge
stations
specially
built
for
them
and
they
make
the
most
ghastly
things
for
killing
other
girls
lovers
all
day
and
they
go
back
by
train
at
night
only
some
of
them
work
all
night
i
had
to
leave
my
own
works
to
organise
the
canteen
of
a
new
filling
factory
five
thousand
girls
in
that
factory
it
frightfully
dangerous
they
have
to
wear
special
clothing
they
have
to
take
off
every
stitch
from
their
bodies
in
one
room
and
run
in
their
innocence
and
nothing
else
to
another
room
where
the
special
clothing
is
that
the
only
way
to
prevent
the
whole
place
being
blown
up
one
beautiful
day
but
five
thousand
of
them
you
ca
imagine
it
you
like
to
but
you
ca
however
i
did
stay
there
very
long
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
my
own
place
i
was
adored
at
my
own
place
of
course
the
men
adored
me
they
used
to
fight
about
me
sometimes
terrific
men
nothing
ever
made
me
happier
than
that
or
so
happy
but
the
girls
were
more
interesting
two
thousand
of
them
there
you
never
guess
it
because
they
were
hidden
in
thickets
of
machinery
but
see
them
rush
out
endlessly
to
the
canteen
for
tea
all
sorts
lots
of
devils
and
cats
some
lovely
creatures
heavenly
creatures
as
fine
as
a
queen
they
adored
me
too
they
did
at
first
some
of
them
but
they
soon
tumbled
to
it
that
i
was
the
modern
woman
and
that
they
never
seen
me
before
and
it
was
a
great
discovery
absurdly
easy
to
raise
yourself
to
be
the
idol
of
a
crowd
that
fancies
itself
canny
incredibly
easy
i
used
to
take
their
part
against
the
as
often
as
i
could
he
was
a
fiend
he
hated
me
but
then
i
was
a
fiend
too
and
i
hated
him
more
i
used
often
to
come
on
at
six
in
the
morning
when
they
did
and
on
it
is
really
signing
on
now
at
all
there
a
clock
dial
and
a
whole
machine
for
catching
you
out
they
loved
to
see
me
doing
that
and
i
worked
the
lathes
sometimes
just
for
a
bit
just
to
show
that
i
was
ashamed
to
work
etc
all
that
sentimental
twaddle
it
pleased
them
and
if
any
really
girl
had
dared
to
say
it
was
sentimental
twaddle
there
would
have
been
a
crucifixion
or
something
of
the
sort
in
the
the
mob
always
the
same
but
what
pleased
them
far
more
than
anything
was
me
knowing
them
by
their
christian
names
not
all
of
course
still
hundreds
of
them
marvellous
feats
of
memorising
i
did
i
used
to
go
about
muttering
under
my
breath
wart
on
left
hand
winnie
wart
on
left
hand
wart
on
left
hand
winnie
you
see
and
i
sworn
at
them
not
often
it
do
naturally
but
there
was
scarcely
a
woman
there
that
i
simply
blast
in
two
seconds
if
i
felt
like
it
on
the
other
hand
i
assure
you
i
could
be
very
tender
i
was
surprised
how
tender
i
could
be
now
and
then
in
my
little
office
they
tell
me
anything
sounds
sentimental
but
they
would
and
some
of
them
had
no
more
notion
that
there
such
a
thing
on
earth
as
propriety
than
a
monkey
has
i
thought
i
knew
everything
before
i
went
to
the
clyde
valley
well
i
did
concepcion
looked
at
you
know
you
very
innocent
compared
to
me
i
should
hope
so
said
impenetrably
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
she
demanded
in
a
fresh
tone
leaning
a
little
towards
him
he
replied
i
impressed
he
was
in
fact
very
profoundly
impressed
but
he
had
to
illustrate
the
hardness
in
himself
which
she
had
revealed
to
him
he
wondered
whether
the
members
of
the
lechford
committee
really
did
credit
him
with
having
dethroned
a
couple
of
chairmen
the
idea
was
new
to
his
modesty
perhaps
he
had
been
underestimating
his
own
weight
on
the
committee
no
doubt
he
had
all
constraint
was
now
dissipated
between
concepcion
and
himself
they
were
behaving
to
each
other
as
though
their
intimacy
had
never
been
interrupted
for
a
single
week
she
amazed
him
sitting
there
in
the
purple
stockings
and
the
affronting
gown
and
he
admired
her
material
achievement
alone
was
prodigious
he
pictured
her
as
she
rose
in
the
winter
dark
and
in
the
summer
dawn
to
go
to
the
works
and
wrestle
with
so
much
incalculable
human
nature
and
so
many
complex
questions
of
organisation
day
after
day
week
after
week
month
after
month
for
nearly
eighteen
months
she
had
kept
it
up
that
was
the
point
she
had
shown
what
she
was
made
of
and
what
she
was
made
of
was
unquestionably
marvellous
he
would
have
liked
to
know
about
various
things
to
which
she
had
made
no
reference
did
she
live
in
a
frowsy
near
the
great
works
what
kind
of
food
did
she
get
what
did
she
do
with
her
evenings
and
her
sundays
was
she
bored
was
she
miserable
or
exultant
had
she
acquaintances
external
interests
or
did
she
immerse
herself
completely
inclusively
in
the
huge
smoking
whirring
foul
perilous
hell
which
she
had
described
the
contemplation
of
the
horror
of
the
hell
gave
him
and
her
too
he
thought
a
curious
feeling
which
was
not
unpleasurable
it
had
savour
he
would
not
however
inquire
from
her
concerning
details
he
preferred
on
reflection
to
keep
the
details
mysterious
as
mysterious
as
her
individuality
and
as
the
impression
of
her
worn
eyes
the
setting
of
mystery
in
his
mind
suited
her
he
said
but
of
course
your
relations
with
those
girls
were
artificial
after
all
no
they
were
i
tell
you
the
girls
were
perfectly
open
there
was
the
slightest
artificiality
yes
but
were
you
open
to
them
did
you
ever
tell
them
anything
about
yourself
for
instance
oh
no
did
they
ever
ask
you
to
no
they
would
have
thought
of
doing
so
that
what
i
call
artificiality
by
the
way
how
have
you
been
ruined
who
ruined
you
was
it
the
hated
there
had
been
no
change
in
his
tone
he
spoke
with
the
utmost
detachment
i
was
coming
to
that
answered
concepcion
apparently
with
a
detachment
equal
to
his
last
week
but
one
in
one
of
the
shops
there
was
a
girl
standing
in
front
of
a
machine
with
her
back
to
it
about
you
must
see
her
in
your
mind
about
nice
chestnut
hair
cap
over
it
of
course
that
the
rule
khaki
overalls
and
trousers
rather
boots
they
fancy
themselves
thank
god
and
a
bit
of
lace
showing
out
of
the
khaki
at
the
neck
red
cheeks
she
was
fairly
new
to
the
works
do
you
see
her
she
meant
to
be
one
of
the
devils
earning
two
pounds
a
week
nearly
and
eagerly
spending
it
all
fully
awake
to
all
the
possibilities
of
her
body
i
was
in
the
shop
i
said
something
to
her
and
she
hear
at
first
the
noise
of
some
of
the
shops
is
shattering
i
went
close
to
her
and
repeated
it
she
laughed
out
of
mere
vivacity
and
threw
back
her
head
as
people
do
when
they
laugh
the
machine
behind
her
must
have
caught
some
hair
that
was
under
her
cap
all
her
hair
was
dragged
from
under
the
cap
and
in
no
time
all
her
hair
was
torn
out
and
the
whole
of
her
scalp
ripped
clean
off
in
a
second
or
two
i
got
her
on
to
a
trolley
i
did
it
and
threw
an
overall
over
her
and
ran
her
to
the
close
to
the
main
office
entrance
there
was
a
car
there
one
of
the
directors
was
just
driving
off
i
stopped
him
it
was
a
case
for
our
in
three
minutes
i
had
her
at
the
hospital
three
minutes
the
car
was
soaked
in
blood
but
she
did
lose
consciousness
that
child
did
dead
now
she
buried
her
body
that
she
meant
to
use
so
profusely
for
her
own
delights
is
squeezed
up
in
the
little
black
box
in
the
dark
and
the
silence
down
below
where
the
spring
ca
get
at
it
i
had
no
sleep
for
two
nights
on
the
second
day
a
doctor
at
the
hospital
said
that
i
must
take
at
least
three
months
holiday
he
said
i
had
a
nervous
breakdown
i
did
know
i
had
and
i
do
know
now
i
said
i
would
take
any
holiday
and
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
why
con
because
i
sworn
absolutely
sworn
to
myself
to
stick
that
job
till
the
war
was
over
you
understand
i
sworn
it
well
they
let
me
on
to
the
works
and
yesterday
one
of
the
directors
brought
me
up
to
town
himself
he
was
very
kind
in
his
clyde
way
now
you
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
i
ruined
i
ruined
with
myself
you
see
i
did
stick
it
i
could
but
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
girls
who
saw
the
accident
they
sticking
it
yes
he
said
in
a
voice
soft
and
moved
i
understand
and
while
he
spoke
thus
aloud
though
his
emotion
was
genuine
and
his
desire
to
comfort
and
sustain
her
genuine
and
his
admiration
for
her
genuine
he
thought
to
himself
how
theatrically
she
told
it
every
effect
was
studied
nearly
every
word
well
she
ca
help
it
but
does
she
imagine
i
ca
see
that
all
the
casualness
was
deliberately
part
of
the
effect
she
lit
a
cigarette
and
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
and
curved
her
ringed
fingers
which
had
withstood
time
and
fatigue
much
better
than
her
face
and
then
she
reclined
again
on
the
on
her
back
and
sent
up
smoke
perpendicularly
and
through
the
smoke
seemed
to
be
trying
to
decipher
the
enigmas
of
the
ceiling
rose
and
stood
over
her
in
silence
at
last
she
went
on
the
work
those
girls
do
is
excruciating
hellish
and
they
realise
it
that
the
worst
of
it
they
never
be
the
same
again
they
ruining
their
health
and
what
more
important
their
looks
you
can
see
them
changing
under
your
eyes
ours
was
the
best
factory
on
the
clyde
and
the
conditions
were
unspeakable
in
spite
of
canteens
and
and
libraries
and
sanitation
and
all
this
damned
fancy
a
girl
chained
up
for
twelve
hours
every
day
to
a
thundering
whizzing
iron
machine
that
never
gets
tired
the
machine
just
as
fresh
at
six
at
night
as
it
was
at
six
in
the
morning
and
just
as
anxious
to
maim
her
if
she
look
out
for
herself
more
anxious
the
whole
thing
still
going
on
they
at
it
now
this
very
minute
you
interested
in
a
factory
are
you
yes
he
answered
gently
but
looked
with
seemingly
callous
firmness
down
at
her
the
reveille
company
or
some
such
name
yes
making
tons
of
money
i
hear
yes
you
a
profiteer
i
not
long
since
i
decided
i
must
give
away
all
my
extra
profits
ever
go
and
look
at
your
factory
no
any
nice
young
girls
working
there
i
do
know
if
there
are
are
they
decently
treated
do
know
that
either
why
do
you
go
and
see
it
no
business
of
mine
yes
it
is
are
you
making
yourself
glorious
as
a
philanthropist
out
of
the
thing
i
tell
you
it
no
business
of
mine
he
insisted
evenly
i
do
anything
if
i
went
i
no
status
rotten
system
possibly
but
systems
ca
be
altered
like
that
systems
alter
themselves
and
they
are
in
a
hurry
about
it
this
system
new
though
it
new
to
you
you
people
in
london
do
know
what
work
is
and
what
about
your
clyde
strikes
retorted
well
all
that
settled
now
said
concepcion
rather
uneasily
like
a
champion
who
foresees
a
fight
but
lacks
confidence
yes
but
suddenly
altered
his
tone
to
the
persuasive
you
must
know
all
about
those
strikes
what
was
the
real
cause
we
understand
them
here
if
you
really
want
to
know
nerves
she
said
earnestly
and
triumphantly
nerves
overwork
no
rest
no
change
everlasting
punishment
the
one
incomprehensible
thing
to
me
is
that
the
whole
of
glasgow
did
go
on
strike
and
stay
out
for
ever
there
just
as
much
overwork
in
london
as
there
is
on
the
clyde
there
a
lot
more
talking
parliament
cabinet
committees
you
should
hear
what
they
say
about
it
in
glasgow
con
he
said
kindly
you
do
suspect
it
but
you
childish
it
the
job
of
one
part
of
london
to
talk
if
that
part
of
london
did
talk
your
tribes
on
the
clyde
could
work
because
they
would
know
what
to
do
nor
how
to
do
it
talking
has
to
come
before
working
and
let
me
tell
you
it
more
difficult
and
it
more
killing
because
it
more
responsible
excuse
this
common
sense
made
easy
for
beginners
but
you
brought
it
on
yourself
she
frowned
and
what
do
you
do
do
you
talk
or
work
she
smiled
i
tell
you
this
said
he
smiling
candidly
and
benevolently
it
took
me
a
dickens
of
a
time
really
to
myself
into
anything
that
meant
steady
effort
i
lost
the
habit
natural
enough
and
i
not
going
into
sackcloth
about
it
however
i
improving
i
going
to
take
on
the
secretaryship
of
the
lechford
committee
some
of
may
want
me
but
they
have
to
have
me
and
when
they
got
me
they
have
to
look
out
all
of
them
including
queen
and
her
mother
will
it
take
the
whole
of
your
time
yes
i
doing
three
days
a
week
now
i
suppose
you
think
you
beaten
me
con
i
do
ask
you
not
to
be
a
child
but
i
am
a
child
why
do
you
humour
me
you
know
i
had
a
nervous
breakdown
you
used
to
humour
me
he
shook
his
head
humouring
you
wo
do
nervous
breakdown
any
good
it
might
some
women
but
not
yours
you
shall
humour
me
she
cried
i
have
told
you
half
my
ruin
do
you
know
i
meant
to
love
carly
all
my
life
i
felt
sure
i
should
well
i
ca
it
gone
all
that
feeling
already
in
less
than
two
years
and
now
i
only
sorry
for
him
and
sorry
for
myself
is
it
horrible
is
it
horrible
try
not
to
think
he
murmured
she
sat
up
impetuously
do
talk
such
damned
nonsense
not
to
think
why
my
frightful
unhappiness
is
the
one
thing
that
keeps
me
alive
yes
yielded
it
was
nonsense
she
sank
back
he
saw
moisture
in
her
eyes
and
felt
it
in
his
own
chapter
salome
lady
queenie
arrived
in
haste
as
though
relentless
time
had
pursued
her
up
the
stairs
why
you
in
the
dark
here
she
exclaimed
impatiently
and
impatiently
switched
on
several
lights
sorry
i
late
she
said
perfunctorily
without
taking
any
trouble
to
put
conviction
into
her
voice
how
have
you
two
been
getting
on
she
looked
at
concepcion
and
in
a
peculiar
way
inquisitorial
and
implicatory
then
towards
the
door
come
in
come
in
dialin
a
young
soldier
with
the
stripe
of
a
entered
slightly
nervous
and
slightly
defiant
and
you
miss
a
young
woman
entered
she
had
very
red
lips
and
very
high
heels
and
was
both
more
nervous
and
more
defiant
than
the
young
soldier
this
is
dialin
you
know
con
second
at
the
ottoman
i
met
him
by
sheer
marvellous
chance
he
only
got
ten
minutes
he
has
really
got
that
but
he
going
to
see
me
do
my
salome
dance
lady
queenie
made
no
attempt
to
introduce
miss
who
of
her
own
accord
took
a
chair
with
a
curious
dashed
effrontery
it
appeared
that
she
was
attached
to
dialin
lady
queenie
cast
off
rapidly
gloves
hat
and
coat
and
then
having
rushed
to
the
bell
and
rung
it
fiercely
several
times
came
back
to
the
and
gazed
at
it
and
at
the
surrounding
floor
would
you
mind
con
concepcion
rose
lady
queenie
rushing
off
again
pushed
several
more
switches
and
from
a
thick
cluster
of
bulbs
in
front
of
a
large
mirror
at
the
end
of
the
room
there
fell
dazzling
sheets
of
light
a
footman
presented
himself
push
the
right
away
towards
the
window
she
commanded
the
footman
inclined
and
obeyed
and
the
superiorly
helped
him
then
the
footman
was
told
to
energise
the
gramophone
which
in
its
specially
designed
case
stood
in
a
corner
the
footman
seemed
to
be
on
intimate
terms
with
the
gramophone
meanwhile
lady
queenie
with
a
was
fastening
the
back
hem
of
her
short
skirt
to
the
front
between
the
knees
still
bending
she
took
her
shoes
off
her
scent
impregnated
the
room
you
see
it
will
be
barefoot
she
explained
to
dialin
the
walls
of
london
were
already
billed
with
an
early
announcement
of
the
marvels
of
the
pageant
of
terpsichore
which
was
to
occur
at
the
albert
hall
under
the
superintendence
of
the
greatest
modern
english
painters
in
aid
of
a
fund
for
soldiers
disabled
by
deafness
the
performers
were
all
ladies
of
the
upper
world
ladies
bearing
names
for
the
most
part
as
familiar
as
the
names
of
streets
and
not
a
among
them
amateurism
was
to
be
absolutely
untainted
by
professionalism
in
the
prodigious
affair
therefore
the
prices
of
tickets
ruled
high
and
queens
had
conferred
their
patronage
lady
queenie
removed
several
bracelets
and
a
necklace
and
seizing
a
plate
deposited
it
on
the
carpet
that
piece
of
she
said
is
the
head
of
my
beloved
john
the
clever
footman
started
the
gramophone
and
lady
queenie
began
to
dance
the
walked
round
her
surveying
her
at
all
angles
watching
her
like
a
tiger
imitating
movements
suggesting
movements
sketching
emotions
with
his
arm
raising
himself
at
intervals
on
the
toes
of
his
thick
boots
after
a
few
moments
concepcion
glanced
at
conveying
to
him
a
passionate
adoring
admiration
of
queen
talent
startled
by
her
brightened
eyes
so
suddenly
full
of
temperament
nodded
to
please
her
but
the
fact
was
that
he
saw
naught
to
admire
in
the
beautiful
and
brazen
amateur
performance
he
wondered
that
she
could
not
have
discovered
something
more
original
than
to
follow
the
footsteps
of
maud
allan
in
a
scene
which
years
ago
had
become
stale
he
wondered
that
at
any
rate
concepcion
should
not
perceive
the
poor
pretentious
quality
of
the
girlish
exhibition
and
as
he
looked
at
the
mincing
dialin
he
pictured
the
helping
to
serve
a
gun
and
as
he
looked
at
the
youthful
lithe
queenie
posturing
in
the
of
rays
amid
the
blazing
chromatic
fantasy
of
the
room
and
his
nostrils
twitched
to
her
pungent
perfume
he
pictured
the
reverberating
on
the
clyde
where
girls
had
their
scalps
torn
off
by
unappeasable
machinery
and
the
where
five
thousand
girls
stripped
themselves
naked
in
order
to
lessen
the
danger
of
being
blown
to
bits
after
a
climax
of
capering
queen
fell
full
length
on
her
stomach
upon
the
carpet
her
soft
chin
accurately
adjusted
to
the
edge
of
the
plate
the
music
ceased
the
gramophone
gnashed
on
the
disc
until
the
footman
lifted
its
fang
miss
raised
both
her
feet
from
the
floor
stuck
her
legs
out
in
a
straight
slanting
line
and
condescendingly
clapped
then
seeing
that
queen
was
worrying
the
piece
of
with
her
teeth
she
exclaimed
in
agitation
ow
my
dialin
assisted
the
breathless
queen
to
rise
and
they
went
off
into
a
corner
and
he
talked
to
her
in
low
tones
soon
he
looked
at
his
and
caught
the
summoning
eye
of
miss
but
it
pretty
all
right
is
it
said
queen
oh
yes
oh
yes
he
soothed
her
with
an
expert
casualness
naturally
you
want
to
work
it
up
you
fell
beautifully
now
you
go
and
see
crevelli
he
the
man
i
shall
get
him
to
come
here
what
his
address
i
do
know
he
just
moved
but
you
see
it
in
the
april
number
of
dancing
as
the
footman
was
about
to
escort
dialin
and
his
urgent
lady
downstairs
queen
ordered
bring
me
up
a
it
splendid
queen
said
concepcion
enthusiastically
when
the
two
were
alone
with
i
so
glad
you
think
so
darling
how
are
you
darling
she
kissed
the
older
woman
affectionately
fondly
on
the
lips
and
then
gave
a
challenging
glance
oh
she
exclaimed
and
called
out
very
loud
robin
i
want
you
at
once
the
secretarial
miss
robinson
carrying
a
appeared
like
magic
from
the
inner
room
get
me
the
april
number
of
dancing
corrected
well
it
all
the
same
and
write
to
opson
and
say
that
we
really
must
have
proper
accommodation
it
most
important
yes
your
ladyship

ladyship
has
the
as
to
entrance
arrangements
for
the
public
at
six
i
sha
go
telephone
to
them
i
got
quite
enough
to
do
without
that
i
utterly
exhausted
do
forget
about
dancing
and
to
write
to
mr
opson
yes
your
ladyship
said
queen
after
robin
had
gone
you
are
a
pig
if
you
go
on
that
as
to
entrance
arrangements
you
know
what
the
albert
hall
is
they
make
a
horrible
mess
of
it
and
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
do
better
than
anybody
yes
but
a
pig
i
am
answered
firmly
then
he
added
i
tell
you
how
you
might
have
avoided
all
these
complications
how
by
having
no
pageant
and
simply
going
round
collecting
subscriptions
nobody
would
have
refused
you
and
there
have
been
no
expenses
to
come
off
the
total
lady
queenie
put
her
lips
together
has
he
been
behaving
in
this
style
to
you
con
a
little
now
and
then
said
concepcion
later
when
the
and
queen
shoes
had
been
replaced
and
the
and
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
taken
away
and
all
the
lights
extinguished
save
one
over
the
mantelpiece
and
lady
queenie
had
nearly
finished
the
and
nothing
remained
of
the
rehearsal
except
the
between
lady
queenie
knees
was
still
waiting
for
her
to
bethink
herself
of
the
hospitals
subject
upon
which
he
had
called
by
special
request
and
appointment
to
see
her
he
took
oath
not
to
mention
it
first
shortly
afterwards
stiff
in
his
resolution
he
departed
in
three
minutes
he
was
in
the
of
his
club
warming
himself
at
a
fine
old
huge
wasteful
grate
in
which
burned
such
a
coal
fire
as
could
not
have
been
seen
in
france
italy
germany
austria
russia
nor
anywhere
on
the
continent
of
europe
the
war
had
as
yet
changed
nothing
in
the
impregnable
club
unless
it
was
that
ordinary
matches
had
recently
been
substituted
for
the
giant
matches
on
which
the
club
had
hitherto
prided
itself
the
hour
lay
neglected
midway
between
tea
and
dinner
and
there
were
only
two
other
members
in
the
vast
room
solitaries
each
before
his
own
grand
fire
took
up
which
his
duties
had
prevented
him
from
reading
at
large
in
the
morning
he
wandered
with
a
sense
of
ease
among
its
multifarious
pages
and
in
full
leisure
brought
his
information
up
to
date
concerning
the
state
of
the
war
and
of
the
country
by
zeppelins
were
frequent
and
some
authorities
talked
magniloquently
about
the
defence
of
london
hundreds
of
people
had
paid
immense
sums
for
pictures
and
objects
of
art
at
the
red
cross
sale
at
christie
one
of
the
most
successful
social
events
of
the
year
the
house
of
commons
was
inquisitive
about
mesopotamia
as
a
whole
and
one
british
army
was
still
trying
to
relieve
another
british
army
besieged
in
kut
german
submarine
successes
were
obviously
disquieting
the
supply
of
beer
was
reduced
there
were
to
be
forty
principal
aristocratic
dancers
in
the
pageant
of
terpsichore
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
had
budgeted
for
five
hundred
millions
and
was
very
proud
the
best
people
were
at
once
proud
and
scared
of
the
new
income
tax
at
in
the
they
expressed
the
fear
that
such
a
tax
would
kill
income
or
send
it
to
america
the
theatrical
profession
was
quite
sure
that
the
amusements
tax
would
involve
utter
ruin
for
the
theatrical
profession
and
the
match
trade
was
quite
sure
that
the
match
tax
would
put
an
end
to
matches
and
some
unnamed
modest
individuals
had
apparently
decided
that
the
travel
tax
must
and
forthwith
would
be
dropped
the
story
of
the
evacuation
of
gallipoli
had
grown
old
and
tedious
cranks
were
still
vainly
trying
to
prove
to
the
blunt
john
bullishness
of
the
prime
minister
that
the
daylight
saving
bill
was
not
a
piece
of
mere
freak
legislation
the
whole
of
the
west
end
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
country
houses
in
britain
had
discovered
a
new
deity
in
australia
and
spent
all
their
spare
time
and
lungs
in
asserting
that
all
other
deities
were
false
and
futile
his
earthly
name
was
hughes
jan
smuts
was
fighting
in
the
primeval
forests
of
east
africa
the
germans
were
discussing
their
war
aims
and
on
the
verdun
front
they
had
reached
mort
homme
in
the
usual
way
that
was
according
to
the
london
press
by
sacrificing
more
men
than
any
place
could
possibly
be
worth
still
they
had
reached
mort
homme
and
though
our
losses
and
the
french
losses
were
everywhere
one
might
assert
so
to
speak
negligible
nevertheless
the
steadfast
band
of
thinkers
and
who
held
a
monopoly
of
true
patriotism
were
extremely
anxious
to
extend
the
military
service
act
so
as
to
rope
into
the
army
every
fit
male
in
the
island
except
themselves
the
pages
of
grew
and
descried
concepcion
moving
mysteriously
in
a
mist
behind
them
only
then
did
he
begin
effectively
to
realise
her
experiences
and
her
achievement
and
her
ordeal
on
the
distant
romantic
clyde
he
said
to
himself
i
could
never
have
stood
what
she
has
stood
she
was
a
terrific
woman
but
because
she
was
such
a
mixture
of
the
and
the
he
rather
condescended
to
her
she
lacked
what
he
was
sure
he
possessed
and
what
he
prized
beyond
everything
poise
and
had
she
truly
had
a
nervous
breakdown
or
was
that
fancy
did
she
truly
despair
of
herself
as
a
ruined
woman
doubly
ruined
or
was
she
acting
a
part
as
much
in
order
to
impress
herself
as
in
order
to
impress
others
he
thought
the
country
and
particularly
its
press
was
somewhat
like
concepcion
as
a
complex
he
condescended
to
queenie
also
not
bitterly
but
with
sardonic
pity
there
she
was
unalterable
by
any
war
instinctively
and
ruthlessly
working
out
her
soul
and
her
destiny
the
country
was
somewhat
like
queenie
too
but
of
course
comparison
between
queenie
and
concepcion
was
absurd
he
had
had
to
defend
himself
to
concepcion
and
had
he
not
defended
himself
true
he
had
begun
perhaps
too
slowly
to
work
for
the
war
however
he
had
begun
what
else
could
he
have
done
beyond
what
he
had
done
become
a
special
constable
grotesque
he
simply
could
not
see
himself
as
a
special
constable
and
if
the
country
could
not
employ
him
more
usefully
than
in
standing
on
guard
over
an
electricity
works
or
a
railway
bridge
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
country
deserved
to
lose
his
services
become
a
volunteer
even
more
grotesque
was
he
a
man
turned
fifty
to
dress
up
and
fall
flat
on
the
ground
at
the
word
of
some
fantastic
jackanapes
or
stare
into
vacancy
while
some
inspecting
general
examined
his
person
as
though
it
were
a
mannikin
he
had
tried
several
times
to
get
into
a
government
department
which
would
utilise
his
brains
but
without
success
and
the
club
hummed
with
the
unimaginable
stories
related
by
disappointed
and
dignified
men
whose
too
eager
patriotism
had
been
rendered
ridiculous
by
the
vicious
foolery
of
government
departments
no
he
had
some
work
to
do
and
he
was
doing
it
people
were
looking
to
him
for
decision
for
sagacity
for
initiative
he
supplied
these
things
his
work
might
grow
even
beyond
his
expectations
but
if
it
did
not
he
should
not
worry
he
felt
that
unfatigued
he
could
and
would
contribute
to
the
mass
of
the
national
resolution
in
the
latter
and
more
racking
half
of
the
war
morally
he
was
profiting
by
the
war
nay
more
in
a
deep
sense
he
was
enjoying
it
the
immensity
of
it
the
terror
of
it
the
idiocy
of
it
the
splendour
of
it
its
unique
grandeur
as
an
illustration
of
human
nature
thrilled
the
spectator
in
him
he
had
little
fear
for
the
result
the
nations
had
measured
themselves
the
factors
of
the
equation
were
known
britain
conceivably
might
not
win
but
she
could
never
lose
and
he
did
not
accept
the
singular
theory
that
unless
she
won
this
war
another
war
would
necessarily
follow
he
had
in
spite
of
all
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
mankind
and
would
not
exaggerate
its
capacity
for
lunatic
madness
the
worst
was
over
when
paris
was
definitely
saved
suffering
would
sink
and
die
like
a
fire
privations
were
paid
for
day
by
day
in
the
cash
of
fortitude
taxes
would
always
be
met
a
whole
generation
including
himself
would
rapidly
vanish
and
the
next
would
stand
in
its
place
and
at
worst
the
path
of
evolution
was
unchangeably
appointed
a
harsh
callous
philosophy
perhaps
what
impressed
him
and
possibly
intimidated
him
beyond
anything
else
whatever
was
the
onset
of
the
next
generation
he
thought
of
queenie
of
dialin
of
miss
of
lieutenant
molder
how
unconsciously
sure
of
themselves
and
arrogant
in
their
years
how
strong
how
unapprehensive
and
yet
he
had
just
been
taking
credit
for
his
own
freedom
from
apprehensiveness
they
were
young
and
he
was
so
no
longer
pooh
a
brave
pooh
he
was
wiser
than
they
he
had
acquired
the
supreme
and
subtly
enjoyable
faculty
which
they
had
yet
painfully
to
acquire
of
nice
sure
discriminating
judgment
concepcion
had
divested
herself
of
youth
and
christine
since
he
knew
her
had
never
had
any
youthfulness
save
the
physical
there
were
only
these
two
said
a
voice
behind
him
you
dining
here
i
am
shall
we
crack
a
bottle
together
it
was
astonishing
and
deplorable
how
clichés
survived
in
the
best
clubs
by
all
means
the
voice
spoke
lower
that
bollinger
all
gone
at
last
you
were
fearing
the
worst
the
last
time
i
saw
you
said
auction
afterwards
the
voice
suggested
afraid
i
ca
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
shall
have
to
leave
early
chapter
the
streets
after
dinner
walked
a
little
eastwards
from
the
club
and
entering
leicester
square
from
the
south
crossed
it
and
then
turned
westwards
again
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
leading
to
piccadilly
circus
it
was
about
the
time
when
christine
usually
went
from
her
flat
to
her
promenade
without
admitting
a
definite
resolve
to
see
christine
that
evening
he
had
said
to
himself
that
he
would
rather
like
to
see
her
or
that
he
would
mind
seeing
her
and
that
he
might
if
the
mood
took
him
call
at
cork
street
and
catch
her
before
she
left
having
advanced
thus
far
in
the
sketch
of
his
intentions
he
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
take
precautions
to
encounter
her
in
the
street
assuming
that
she
had
already
started
but
had
not
reached
the
theatre
the
chance
of
meeting
her
on
her
way
was
exceedingly
small
nevertheless
he
would
not
miss
it
hence
his
roundabout
route
and
hence
his
selection
of
the
chaste
as
against
the
unchaste
pavement
of
coventry
street
he
knew
very
little
of
christine
professional
arrangements
but
he
did
know
from
occasional
remarks
of
hers
that
owing
to
the
need
for
economy
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
taxis
she
now
always
walked
to
the
promenade
on
dry
nights
and
that
from
a
motive
of
she
always
took
the
south
side
of
piccadilly
and
the
south
side
of
coventry
street
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
of
ever
being
mistaken
for
something
which
she
was
not
it
was
a
dry
night
but
very
cloudy
points
of
faint
illumination
mysteriously
travelling
across
the
heavens
and
revealing
the
otherwise
invisible
cushioned
surface
of
the
clouds
alone
showed
that
searchlights
were
at
their
work
of
watching
over
the
heedless
town
entertainments
had
drawn
in
the
people
from
the
streets
were
half
empty
implacable
with
thin
exhausted
boys
scarcely
descried
on
their
rear
perches
forced
the
more
fragile
traffic
to
yield
place
to
them
footfarers
were
few
except
on
the
north
side
of
coventry
street
where
officers
soldiers
civilians
police
and
courtesans
marched
eternally
to
and
fro
peering
at
one
another
in
the
thick
gloom
that
except
in
the
immediate
region
of
a
lamp
put
all
girls
the
young
and
the
ageing
the
pretty
and
the
ugly
the
and
the
grasping
on
a
sinister
enticing
equality
and
they
were
all
men
and
women
and
vehicles
phantoms
flitting
and
murmuring
and
hooting
in
the
darkness
and
the
violet
that
hung
in
front
of
theatres
and
cinemas
seemed
to
mark
the
entrances
to
unimaginable
fastnesses
and
the
side
streets
seemed
to
lead
to
the
precipitous
edges
of
the
universe
where
nothing
was
recognised
christine
just
beyond
the
knot
of
loiterers
at
the
piccadilly
tube
the
improbable
had
happened
she
was
walking
at
what
was
for
her
a
rather
quick
pace
purposeful
and
preoccupied
for
an
instant
the
recognition
was
not
mutual
he
liked
the
uninviting
stare
that
she
gave
him
as
he
stopped
it
is
thou
she
exclaimed
and
her
face
softened
suddenly
into
a
delighted
adoring
smile
he
was
moved
by
the
passion
which
she
still
had
for
him
he
felt
vaguely
and
yet
acutely
an
undischarged
obligation
in
regard
to
her
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
met
her
in
such
circumstances
a
constraint
fell
between
them
in
five
minutes
she
would
have
been
in
her
promenade
engaged
upon
her
highly
technical
business
displaying
her
attractions
while
appearing
to
protect
herself
within
a
virginal
timidity
for
this
was
her
natural
method
in
any
case
even
had
he
not
set
forth
on
purpose
to
find
her
he
could
scarcely
have
accompanied
her
to
the
doors
of
the
theatre
and
there
left
her
to
the
night
routine
they
both
hesitated
and
then
without
a
word
he
turned
aside
and
she
followed
close
acquiescent
by
training
and
by
instinct
knowing
his
sure
instinct
for
what
was
proper
she
knew
at
once
that
hazard
had
saved
her
from
the
night
routine
and
she
was
full
of
quiet
triumph
he
of
course
though
absolutely
loyal
to
her
had
for
dignity
sake
to
practise
the
duplicity
of
pretending
to
make
up
his
mind
what
he
should
do
they
went
through
the
tube
station
and
were
soon
in
one
of
the
withdrawn
streets
between
coventry
street
and
pall
mall
east
the
episode
had
somehow
the
air
of
an
adventure
he
looked
at
her
the
hat
was
possibly
rather
large
but
in
truth
she
was
the
image
of
refinement
delicacy
virtue
virtuous
surrender
he
thought
it
was
marvellous
that
there
should
exist
such
a
woman
as
she
and
he
thought
how
marvellous
was
the
protective
vastness
of
the
town
beneath
whose
shield
he
was
free
free
to
live
different
lives
simultaneously
to
make
his
own
laws
to
maintain
indefinitely
exciting
and
delicious
secrecies
not
half
a
mile
off
were
concepcion
and
queen
and
his
amour
was
as
safe
from
them
as
if
he
had
hidden
it
in
the
depths
of
some
hareemed
asiatic
city
christine
said
politely
but
i
detain
thee
as
for
that
he
replied
what
does
that
matter
after
all
thou
knowest
she
said
in
a
new
tone
i
am
all
that
is
most
worried
in
this
london
they
are
never
willing
to
leave
you
in
peace
what
is
it
my
poor
child
he
asked
benevolently
they
talk
of
closing
the
promenade
she
answered
never
he
murmured
easily
reassuringly
he
remembered
the
night
years
earlier
when
as
a
protest
against
some
restrictive
action
of
a
county
council
the
theatre
of
varieties
whose
promenade
rivalled
throughout
the
whole
world
even
the
promenade
of
the
shut
its
doors
and
darkened
its
blazing
facade
and
the
entire
west
end
seemed
to
go
into
a
kind
of
shocked
mourning
but
the
next
night
the
theatre
had
reopened
as
usual
and
the
promenade
had
been
packed
close
the
promenades
absurd
not
the
full
bench
of
archbishops
and
bishops
could
close
the
promenades
the
thing
was
inconceivable
especially
in
when
human
nature
was
so
human
but
it
is
quite
serious
she
cried
everyone
speaks
of
it
what
idiots
what
frightful
lack
of
imagination
and
how
unjust
what
do
they
suppose
we
are
going
to
do
we
other
women
do
they
intend
to
put
respectable
women
like
me
on
to
the
pavement
it
is
a
fantastic
idea
fantastic
and
the
closing
too
there
is
always
the
other
place
the
ottoman
do
not
speak
to
me
of
the
ottoman
moreover
that
also
will
be
suppressed
they
are
all
mad
she
gave
a
great
sigh
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
to
leave
paris
after
all
in
paris
they
know
what
it
is
life
however
i
weary
thee
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
she
controlled
her
agitation
the
subject
was
excessively
delicate
and
that
she
should
have
expressed
herself
so
violently
on
it
showed
the
powerful
reality
of
the
emotion
it
had
aroused
in
her
unquestionably
the
decency
of
her
livelihood
was
at
stake
she
had
convinced
him
of
the
peril
but
what
could
he
say
he
could
not
say
do
not
despair
you
are
indispensable
therefore
you
will
not
be
dispensed
with
these
crises
have
often
arisen
before
and
they
always
end
in
the
same
manner
and
are
there
not
the
big
hotels
the
chic
cinemas
certain
restaurants
not
to
mention
the
clientèle
which
you
must
have
made
for
yourself
such
remarks
were
impossible
but
not
more
impossible
than
the
very
basis
of
his
relations
with
her
he
was
aware
again
of
the
weight
of
an
undischarged
obligation
to
her
his
behaviour
towards
her
had
always
been
perfection
and
yet
was
she
not
his
creditor
he
had
a
conscience
and
it
was
illogical
and
extremely
inconvenient
at
that
moment
a
young
man
flew
along
the
silent
shadowed
street
and
as
he
passed
them
shouted
somewhat
hysterically
the
one
word
zepps
christine
clutched
his
arm
they
stood
still
do
not
be
frightened
said
with
perfect
tranquillity
but
i
hear
guns
she
protested
he
too
heard
the
distant
sounds
of
guns
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
sounds
had
begun
earlier
while
they
were
talking
i
expect
it
only
practice
he
replied
i
seem
to
remember
seeing
a
warning
in
the
paper
about
there
being
practice
one
of
these
nights
christine
increasing
the
pressure
on
his
arm
and
apparently
trying
to
drag
him
away
complained
they
ought
to
give
warning
of
raids
that
is
elementary
this
country
is
so
bizarre
oh
said
full
of
wisdom
and
standing
his
ground
that
would
never
do
warnings
would
make
panics
and
they
would
help
in
the
least
we
are
just
as
safe
here
as
anywhere
even
supposing
there
is
an
the
chance
of
any
particular
spot
being
hit
must
be
several
million
to
one
against
and
i
do
think
for
a
moment
there
is
an
why
well
i
do
answered
with
calm
superiority
the
fact
was
that
he
did
not
know
why
he
thought
there
was
not
an
to
assume
that
there
was
not
an
in
the
absence
of
proof
positive
of
the
existence
of
an
was
with
him
constitutional
a
state
of
mind
precisely
as
illogical
biased
and
credulous
as
the
alarmist
mood
which
he
disdained
in
others
also
he
was
lacking
in
candour
for
after
a
few
seconds
the
suspicion
crept
into
his
mind
that
there
might
indeed
be
an
and
he
would
not
utter
it
in
any
case
said
christine
they
always
give
warning
in
paris
he
thought
i
better
get
this
woman
home
and
said
aloud
come
along
but
is
it
safe
she
asked
anxiously
he
saw
that
she
was
the
primeval
woman
exactly
like
concepcion
and
queen
first
she
wanted
to
run
and
then
when
he
was
ready
to
run
she
asked
is
it
safe
and
he
felt
very
indulgent
and
comfortably
masculine
he
admitted
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
expect
the
conduct
of
a
frightened
christine
to
be
governed
by
the
operations
of
reason
he
was
not
annoyed
because
personally
he
simply
did
not
care
a
whit
whether
they
moved
or
not
while
they
were
hesitating
a
group
of
people
came
round
the
corner
these
people
were
talking
loudly
and
as
they
approached
discerned
that
one
of
them
was
pointing
to
the
sky
there
she
is
there
she
is
shouted
an
eager
voice
seeing
more
human
society
in
and
christine
the
group
stopped
near
them
gazed
in
the
indicated
direction
and
lo
there
was
a
point
of
light
in
the
sky
and
then
guns
suddenly
began
to
sound
much
nearer
what
did
i
tell
you
said
another
voice
i
told
you
they
cleared
the
corner
at
the
bottom
of
james
street
for
a
gun
now
got
her
going
good
for
us
they
shooting
southwards
christine
was
shaking
on
arm
it
all
right
it
all
right
he
murmured
compassionately
and
she
tightened
her
clutch
on
him
in
thanks
he
looked
hard
at
the
point
of
light
which
might
have
been
anything
the
changing
forms
of
thin
clouds
continually
baffled
the
vision
by
god
shouted
the
first
voice
she
hit
see
her
stagger
hit
she
blaze
up
in
a
moment
one
down
last
week
another
this
look
at
her
now
she
afire
the
group
gave
a
weak
cheer
then
the
clouds
cleared
for
an
instant
and
revealed
a
crescent
said
that
the
moon
you
idiots
it
not
a
zeppelin
even
as
he
spoke
he
wondered
and
regretted
that
he
should
be
calling
them
idiots
they
were
complete
strangers
to
him
the
group
vanished
crestfallen
round
another
corner
laughed
to
christine
then
the
noise
of
guns
was
multiplied
that
he
was
with
christine
in
the
midst
of
an
authentic
could
no
longer
be
doubted
he
was
conscious
of
the
wine
he
had
drunk
at
the
club
he
had
the
sensation
of
human
beings
men
like
himself
who
ate
and
drank
and
laced
their
boots
being
actually
at
that
moment
up
there
in
the
sky
with
intent
to
kill
him
and
christine
it
was
a
marvellous
sensation
terrible
but
exquisite
and
he
had
the
sensation
of
other
human
beings
beyond
the
sea
giving
deliberate
orders
in
german
for
murder
murdering
for
their
lives
and
they
too
were
like
himself
and
ate
and
drank
and
either
laced
their
boots
or
had
them
laced
daily
and
the
staggering
apprehension
of
the
miraculous
lunacy
of
war
swept
through
his
soul
chapter
the
child
arm
you
see
he
said
to
christine
it
was
not
a
zeppelin
we
shall
be
quite
safe
here
but
in
that
last
phrase
he
had
now
confessed
to
her
the
existence
of
an
he
knew
that
he
was
not
behaving
with
the
maximum
of
sagacity
there
were
for
example
hotels
with
subterranean
close
by
and
there
were
similar
refuges
where
danger
would
be
less
than
in
the
street
though
the
street
was
narrow
and
might
be
compared
to
a
trench
and
yet
he
had
said
we
shall
be
quite
safe
here
in
others
he
would
have
condemned
such
an
attitude
now
however
he
realised
that
he
was
very
like
others
an
inactive
fatalism
had
seized
him
he
was
too
proud
too
idle
too
negligent
too
curious
to
do
the
wise
thing
he
and
christine
were
in
the
and
in
it
they
should
remain
he
had
just
the
senseless
monkeyish
curiosity
of
the
staring
crowd
so
lyrically
praised
by
the
london
press
he
was
afraid
but
his
curiosity
and
inertia
were
stronger
than
his
fear
then
came
a
most
tremendous
explosion
the
loudest
sound
the
most
formidable
physical
phenomenon
that
had
ever
experienced
in
his
life
the
earth
under
their
feet
trembled
christine
gave
a
squeal
and
seemed
to
subside
to
the
ground
but
he
pulled
her
up
again
not
in
calm
but
by
the
sheer
automatism
of
instinct
a
spasm
of
horrible
fright
shot
through
him
he
thought
in
awe
and
stupefaction
a
bomb
he
thought
about
death
and
maiming
and
blood
the
relations
between
him
and
those
everyday
males
aloft
in
the
sky
seemed
to
be
appallingly
close
after
the
explosion
perfect
silence
no
screams
no
noise
of
crumbling
perfect
silence
and
yet
the
explosion
seemed
still
to
dominate
the
air
ears
ached
and
sang
something
must
be
done
all
theories
of
safety
had
been
smashed
to
atoms
in
the
explosion
dragged
christine
along
the
street
he
knew
not
why
the
street
was
unharmed
not
the
slightest
trace
in
it
so
far
as
could
tell
in
the
gloom
of
destruction
but
where
the
explosion
had
been
whether
east
west
south
or
north
he
could
not
guess
except
for
the
disturbance
in
his
ears
the
explosion
might
have
been
a
hallucination
suddenly
he
saw
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
wide
thoroughfare
and
he
could
not
be
sure
what
thoroughfare
it
was
two
passed
the
end
of
the
street
at
mad
speed
then
two
taxis
then
a
number
of
people
men
and
women
running
hard
useless
and
silly
to
risk
the
perils
of
that
wide
thoroughfare
he
turned
back
with
christine
he
got
her
to
run
in
the
thick
gloom
he
looked
for
an
open
door
or
a
porch
but
there
was
none
the
houses
were
like
the
houses
of
the
dead
he
made
more
than
one
right
angle
turn
christine
gave
a
sign
that
she
could
go
no
farther
he
ceased
trying
to
drag
her
he
was
recovering
himself
once
more
he
heard
the
guns
childishly
feeble
after
the
explosion
of
the
bomb
after
all
one
spot
was
as
safe
as
another
the
outline
of
a
building
seemed
familiar
it
was
an
abandoned
chapel
he
knew
he
was
in
martin
street
he
was
about
to
pull
christine
into
the
shelter
of
the
front
of
the
chapel
when
something
happened
for
which
he
could
not
find
a
name
true
it
was
an
explosion
but
the
previous
event
had
been
an
explosion
and
this
one
was
a
thousandfold
more
intimidating
the
earth
swayed
up
and
down
the
sound
alone
of
the
immeasurable
cataclysm
annihilated
the
universe
the
sound
and
the
concussion
transcended
what
had
been
conceivable
both
the
sound
and
the
concussion
seemed
to
last
for
a
long
time
then
like
an
afterthought
succeeded
the
awful
noise
of
falling
masses
and
the
innumerable
crystal
tinkling
of
shattered
glass
this
noise
ceased
and
began
again
was
now
in
a
strange
condition
of
mild
wonder
there
was
silence
in
the
dark
solitude
of
martin
street
then
the
sound
of
guns
supervened
once
more
but
they
were
distant
guns
discovered
that
he
was
not
holding
christine
and
also
that
instead
of
being
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
was
leaning
against
the
door
of
a
house
he
called
faintly
christine
no
reply
in
a
moment
he
said
to
himself
i
must
go
out
and
look
for
her
but
i
am
not
quite
ready
yet
he
had
a
slight
pain
in
his
side
it
was
naught
it
was
naught
especially
in
comparison
with
the
strange
conviction
of
weakness
and
confusion
he
thought
we
not
won
this
war
yet
and
he
had
qualms
one
poor
lamp
burned
in
the
street
he
started
to
walk
slowly
and
uncertainly
towards
it
near
by
he
saw
a
hat
on
the
ground
it
was
his
own
he
put
it
on
suddenly
the
street
lamp
went
out
he
walked
on
and
stepped
into
broken
glass
then
the
road
was
clear
again
he
halted
not
a
sign
of
christine
he
decided
that
she
must
have
run
away
and
that
she
would
run
blindly
and
finding
herself
either
in
leicester
square
or
lower
regent
street
would
by
instinct
run
home
at
any
rate
she
could
not
be
blown
to
atoms
for
they
were
together
at
the
instant
of
the
explosion
she
must
exist
and
she
must
have
had
the
power
of
motion
he
remembered
that
he
had
had
a
stick
he
had
it
no
longer
he
turned
back
and
taking
from
his
pocket
the
electric
torch
which
had
lately
come
into
fashion
he
examined
the
road
for
his
stick
the
sole
object
of
interest
which
the
torch
revealed
was
a
child
severed
arm
with
a
fragment
of
brown
frock
on
it
and
a
tinsel
ring
on
one
of
the
fingers
of
the
dirty
little
hand
the
blood
from
the
other
end
had
stained
the
ground
abruptly
switched
off
the
torch
nausea
overcame
him
and
then
a
feeling
of
the
most
intense
pity
and
anger
overcame
the
nausea
a
month
elapsed
before
he
could
mention
his
discovery
of
the
child
arm
to
anyone
at
all
the
arm
lay
there
as
if
it
had
been
thrown
there
whence
had
it
come
no
doubt
it
had
come
from
over
the
housetops
he
smelt
gas
and
then
he
felt
cold
water
in
his
boots
water
was
advancing
in
a
flood
along
the
street
broken
mains
of
course
he
said
to
himself
and
was
rather
pleased
with
the
promptness
of
his
explanation
at
the
elbow
of
martin
street
where
a
new
dim
vista
opened
up
he
saw
policemen
then
firemen
then
he
heard
the
beat
of
a
upon
whose
brass
glinted
the
reflection
of
flames
that
were
flickering
in
a
gap
between
two
buildings
a
huge
pile
of
debris
encumbered
the
middle
of
the
road
the
vista
was
closed
by
a
barricade
beyond
which
was
a
pressing
crowd
stand
clear
there
said
a
policeman
to
him
roughly
there
a
wall
going
to
fall
there
any
minute
he
walked
off
hurrying
with
relief
from
the
scene
of
busy
dim
silhouettes
he
could
scarcely
understand
it
and
he
was
incapable
of
replying
to
the
policeman
he
wanted
to
be
alone
and
to
ponder
himself
back
into
perfect
composure
at
the
elbow
again
he
halted
afresh
and
as
he
stood
figures
in
couples
bearing
stretchers
strode
past
him
the
stretchers
were
covered
with
cloths
that
hung
down
not
the
faintest
sound
came
from
beneath
the
cloths
after
a
time
he
went
on
the
other
exit
of
martin
street
was
being
barricaded
as
he
reached
it
a
large
crowd
had
assembled
and
there
was
a
sound
of
talking
like
steady
rain
he
pushed
grimly
through
the
crowd
he
was
set
apart
from
the
idle
crowd
he
would
tell
the
crowd
nothing
in
a
minute
he
was
going
westwards
on
the
left
side
of
coventry
street
again
the
other
side
was
as
populous
with
saunterers
as
ever
the
violet
still
burned
in
front
of
the
theatres
and
cinemas
swept
by
taxis
swept
by
parcels
vans
swept
by
hooting
a
newsman
was
selling
papers
at
the
corner
was
he
in
a
dream
now
or
had
he
been
in
a
dream
in
street
the
vast
capacity
of
the
capital
for
digesting
experience
seemed
to
endanger
his
reason
save
for
the
fragments
of
eager
conversation
everywhere
overheard
there
was
not
a
sign
of
disturbance
of
the
town
habitual
life
and
he
was
within
four
hundred
yards
of
the
child
arm
and
of
the
spot
where
the
procession
of
had
passed
one
thought
gradually
gained
ascendancy
in
his
mind
i
am
saved
it
became
exultant
i
might
have
been
blown
to
bits
but
i
am
saved
despite
the
world
anguish
and
the
besetting
imminence
of
danger
life
and
the
city
which
he
inhabited
had
never
seemed
so
enchanting
so
lovely
as
they
did
then
he
hurried
towards
cork
street
hopeful
chapter
romance
at
two
periods
of
the
day
marthe
with
great
effort
and
for
professional
purposes
achieved
some
degree
of
personal
tidiness
the
first
period
began
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
by
six
or
she
had
slipped
back
into
the
sloven
the
second
period
began
at
about
ten
at
night
it
was
more
brilliant
while
it
lasted
but
owing
to
the
accentuation
of
characteristics
by
fatigue
it
seldom
lasted
more
than
an
hour
when
marthe
opened
the
door
to
she
was
at
her
proudest
intensely
conscious
of
being
clean
and
neat
and
unwilling
to
stand
any
nonsense
from
anybody
of
course
she
was
polite
to
as
the
chief
friend
of
the
establishment
and
a
giver
of
good
tips
but
she
deprecated
calls
by
gentlemen
in
the
evening
for
unless
they
were
made
by
appointment
the
risk
of
complications
at
once
arose
the
mention
of
an
rendered
her
definitely
inimical
formerly
marthe
had
been
more
than
average
nervous
in
but
she
had
grown
used
to
them
and
now
defied
them
as
she
kept
all
windows
closed
on
principle
she
heard
less
of
raids
than
some
people
did
not
explain
the
circumstances
he
simply
asked
if
madame
had
returned
no
madame
had
not
returned
true
marthe
had
not
been
unaware
of
guns
and
things
but
there
was
no
need
to
worry
madame
must
have
arrived
at
the
theatre
long
before
the
guns
started
marthe
really
could
not
be
bothered
with
these
unnecessary
apprehensions
she
had
her
duties
to
attend
to
like
other
folks
and
they
were
heavy
and
she
washed
her
hands
of
she
accepted
no
responsibility
for
them
for
her
within
the
flat
they
did
not
exist
and
the
whole
german
was
thereby
foiled
was
on
the
point
of
a
full
explanation
but
he
checked
himself
a
recital
of
the
circumstances
would
not
immediately
help
and
it
might
hinder
concealing
his
astonishment
at
the
excesses
of
which
unimaginative
stolidity
is
capable
even
in
an
italian
he
turned
down
the
stairs
again
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
stairs
because
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
he
seemed
to
lack
force
for
decisions
no
harm
could
have
happened
to
christine
she
had
run
off
that
was
certain
and
yet
had
he
not
often
heard
of
the
impish
tricks
of
explosions
of
one
person
being
taken
and
another
left
was
it
not
possible
that
christine
had
been
blown
to
the
other
end
of
the
street
and
was
now
lying
there
no
either
she
was
on
her
way
home
or
automatically
she
had
scurried
to
the
theatre
which
was
close
to
street
and
been
too
fearful
to
venture
forth
again
perhaps
she
was
looking
somewhere
for
yet
she
might
be
dead
in
any
case
what
could
he
do
ring
up
the
police
it
was
too
soon
he
decided
that
he
would
wait
in
cork
street
for
half
an
hour
this
plan
appealed
to
him
for
the
mere
reason
that
it
was
negative
as
he
opened
the
front
door
he
saw
a
taxi
standing
outside
the
had
taken
one
of
the
lamps
from
its
bracket
and
was
looking
into
the
interior
of
the
cab
which
was
ornate
with
and
artificial
flowers
to
indicate
to
the
world
that
he
was
an
and
understood
life
hearing
the
noise
of
the
door
he
turned
his
head
he
was
wearing
a
bowler
hat
and
a
smart
white
muffler
and
said
to
with
respect
for
a
gentleman
this
is
no
is
it
sir
yes
the
jerked
his
head
to
draw
attention
to
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
christine
was
half
on
the
seat
and
half
on
the
floor
unconscious
with
shut
eyes
instantly
was
conscious
of
making
a
complete
recovery
from
all
the
effects
physical
and
moral
of
the
just
help
me
to
get
her
out
will
you
he
said
in
a
casual
tone
and
i
carry
her
upstairs
where
did
you
pick
the
lady
up
strand
sir
nearly
opposite
romano
the
dickens
you
did
shock
from
i
suppose
sir
probably
she
did
seem
a
little
upset
when
she
hailed
me
or
i
should
have
taken
her
i
was
off
home
and
i
only
took
her
to
oblige
the
ran
quickly
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
cab
and
entered
it
by
the
behind
christine
together
the
men
lifted
her
up
i
can
manage
her
said
calmly
excuse
me
sir
you
have
to
get
hold
lower
down
so
as
her
waist
be
nearly
as
high
as
your
shoulder
my
brother
a
fireman
right
said
by
the
way
what
the
fare
holding
christine
across
his
shoulder
with
the
right
arm
he
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
with
his
left
hand
and
took
out
change
from
his
trouser
pocket
for
the
driver
you
might
pull
the
door
to
after
me
he
said
in
response
to
the
driver
expression
of
thanks
certainly
sir
the
door
banged
he
was
alone
with
christine
on
the
long
dark
inclement
stairs
he
felt
the
contours
of
her
body
through
her
clothes
she
was
limp
helpless
she
was
a
featherweight
she
was
nothing
at
all
inexpressibly
girlish
pathetic
dear
never
had
felt
as
he
felt
then
he
mounted
the
stairs
rather
quickly
with
firm
disdaining
steps
and
despite
his
being
a
little
out
of
breath
he
had
a
tremendous
triumph
over
the
stolidity
of
marthe
when
she
answered
his
ring
marthe
screamed
and
in
the
scream
readjusted
her
views
concerning
it
queer
this
swoon
lasting
such
a
long
time
he
reflected
when
christine
had
been
deposited
on
the
sofa
in
the
and
the
common
remedies
and
tricks
tried
without
result
and
marthe
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
to
make
hot
water
hotter
he
had
established
absolute
empire
over
marthe
he
had
insisted
on
marthe
not
being
silly
and
yet
though
he
had
already
been
silly
himself
in
his
absurd
speculations
as
to
the
possibility
of
christine
death
he
was
now
in
danger
of
being
silly
again
did
ordinary
swoons
ever
continue
as
this
one
was
continuing
would
christine
ever
come
out
of
it
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
and
her
head
and
shoulders
were
right
under
him
so
that
he
looked
almost
perpendicularly
down
upon
them
her
face
was
as
pale
as
ivory
every
drop
of
blood
seemed
to
have
left
it
the
same
with
her
neck
and
bosom
her
limbs
had
dropped
anyhow
in
disarray
a
fur
jacket
was
untidily
cast
over
her
black
muslin
dress
but
her
waved
hair
fresh
from
the
weekly
visit
of
the
professional
coiffeur
remained
in
the
most
perfect
order
looked
round
the
room
it
was
getting
very
shabby
its
pale
enamelled
shabbiness
and
the
tawdry
ugliness
of
nearly
every
object
in
it
had
never
repelled
and
saddened
him
as
they
did
then
the
sole
agreeable
item
was
a
large
photograph
of
the
mistress
in
a
rich
silver
frame
which
he
had
given
her
she
would
not
let
him
buy
knicknacks
or
draperies
for
her
she
preferred
other
presents
and
now
that
she
lay
in
the
room
but
with
no
power
to
animate
it
he
knew
what
the
room
really
looked
like
it
looked
like
a
except
that
no
dentist
would
expose
copies
of
vie
to
the
view
of
clients
it
had
no
more
individuality
than
a
dentist
indeed
it
was
a
dentist
he
remembered
that
he
had
had
similar
ideas
about
the
room
at
the
beginning
of
his
acquaintance
with
christine
but
he
had
partially
forgotten
them
and
moreover
they
had
not
by
any
means
been
so
clear
and
desolating
as
in
that
moment
he
looked
from
the
photograph
to
her
face
the
face
was
like
the
photograph
but
in
the
swoon
its
wistfulness
became
unbearable
and
it
was
so
young
what
was
she
she
could
not
be
no
age
a
girl
and
talk
about
experience
she
had
had
scarcely
any
experience
save
one
kind
of
experience
the
monotony
and
narrowness
of
her
life
was
terrifying
to
him
he
had
fifty
interests
but
she
had
only
one
all
her
days
were
alike
she
had
no
change
and
no
holiday
no
past
and
no
future
no
family
no
intimate
friends
unless
marthe
was
an
intimate
friend
no
horizons
no
prospects
she
witnessed
life
in
london
through
the
distorting
mystifying
veil
of
a
foreign
language
imperfectly
understood
she
was
the
most
solitary
girl
in
london
or
she
would
have
been
were
there
not
a
hundred
thousand
or
so
others
in
nearly
the
same
case
stay
once
she
had
delicately
allowed
him
to
divine
that
she
had
been
to
bournemouth
with
a
gentleman
for
a
he
could
recall
nothing
else
nightly
or
almost
nightly
she
listened
to
the
same
insufferably
tedious
jokes
in
the
same
insufferably
tedious
revue
but
the
authorities
were
soon
going
to
deprive
her
of
the
opportunity
of
doing
that
and
then
she
would
cease
to
receive
even
the
education
that
revues
can
furnish
and
in
her
mind
no
images
would
survive
but
images
connected
with
the
material
arts
of
love
for
after
all
what
had
they
truly
in
common
he
and
she
but
a
periodical
transient
excitation
when
next
he
looked
at
her
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
a
flush
was
coming
as
imperceptibly
as
the
dawn
into
her
cheeks
he
took
her
hands
again
and
rubbed
them
marthe
returned
and
christine
drank
she
gazed
in
weak
silence
first
at
marthe
and
then
at
after
a
few
moments
no
one
spoke
marthe
took
off
christine
boots
and
rubbed
her
stockinged
feet
and
then
kissed
them
violently
madame
should
go
to
bed
i
am
better
marthe
left
the
room
seeming
resentful
what
has
passed
christine
murmured
without
smiling
a
faint
in
the
taxi
my
poor
child
that
was
all
said
calmly
but
how
is
it
that
i
find
myself
here
i
carried
thee
upstairs
in
my
arms
thou
why
not
he
spoke
lightly
with
careful
negligence
it
appears
that
thou
wast
in
the
strand
was
i
i
lost
thee
something
tore
thee
from
me
i
ran
i
ran
till
i
could
not
run
i
was
sure
that
never
more
should
i
see
thee
alive
oh
my
gilbert
what
terrible
moments
what
a
catastrophe
never
shall
i
forget
those
moments
said
with
bland
supremacy
but
it
is
necessary
that
thou
shouldst
forget
them
master
thyself
thou
knowst
now
what
it
is
an
it
was
an
ordinary
there
have
been
many
like
it
there
will
be
many
more
for
once
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
raid
by
chance
but
we
are
safe
that
is
enough
but
the
deaths
he
shook
his
head
but
there
must
have
been
many
deaths
i
do
not
know
there
will
have
been
deaths
there
usually
are
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
christine
sat
up
and
gave
a
little
screech
ah
she
burst
out
her
features
suddenly
transformed
by
enraged
protest
why
wilt
thou
act
thy
cold
man
he
was
amazed
at
the
sudden
nervous
strength
she
showed
but
my
little
one
she
cried
why
wilt
thou
act
thy
cold
man
i
shall
become
mad
in
this
sacred
england
i
shall
become
totally
mad
you
are
all
the
same
all
all
men
and
women
you
are
marvels
let
it
be
so
but
you
are
not
human
do
you
then
wish
to
be
taken
for
always
you
are
pretending
something
pretending
that
you
have
no
sentiments
and
you
are
soaked
in
sentimentality
but
no
you
will
not
show
it
you
will
not
applaud
your
soldiers
in
the
streets
you
will
not
salute
your

you
will
not
salute
even
a
corpse
you
have
only
one
phrase

nothing
if
you
win
a

if
you
lose

nothing
if
you

if
you

outright
and
could
yet

you
would
say
with
your
eternal
sneer
is
nothing
you
other
men
you

love
with
the
air
of
turning
on
a
tap
as
for

god
knows
but
i
have
a
horror
of
englishwomen
prudes
but
wantons
can
i
not
guess
always
hypocrites
always
holding
themselves
in
my
god
that
pinched
smile
and
your
women
of
the
world
especially
have
they
a
natural
gesture
yet
does
not
everyone
know
that
they
are
rotten
with
vice
and
perversity
and
your
actresses
and
they
talk

ah
well
for
me
i
can
say
that
i
earn
my
living
honestly
every
son
of
it
for
all
that
i
receive
i
give
and
they
would
throw
me
on
to

to
starve
me
whose
function
in
society
she
collapsed
in
sobs
and
with
averted
face
held
out
her
arms
in
appeal
at
once
admiring
and
stricken
with
compassion
bent
and
clasped
her
neck
and
kissed
her
and
kept
his
mouth
on
hers
her
tears
dropped
freely
on
his
cheeks
her
sobs
shook
both
of
them
gradually
the
sobs
decreased
in
violence
and
frequency
in
an
broken
voice
she
murmured
into
his
mouth
my
wolf
is
it
true
that
thou
didst
carry
me
here
in
thy
arms
i
am
so
proud
he
was
not
in
the
slightest
degree
irritated
or
grieved
by
her
tirade
but
the
childlike
changeableness
and
facility
of
her
emotions
touched
him
he
savoured
her
youth
and
himself
felt
curiously
young
it
was
the
fact
that
within
the
last
year
he
had
grown
younger
he
thought
of
great
intellectuals
artists
men
of
action
princes
kings
historical
figures
in
whom
courtesans
had
inspired
immortal
passion
he
thought
of
the
illustrious
courtesans
who
had
made
themselves
heroic
in
legend
women
whose
loves
were
countless
and
often
venal
and
yet
whose
renown
had
come
down
to
posterity
as
gloriously
as
that
of
supreme
poets
he
thought
of
lifelong
passionate
attachments
which
to
the
world
were
inexplicable
and
which
the
world
never
tired
of
leniently
discussing
he
overheard
people
saying
yes
picked
her
up
somewhere
in
a
promenade
she
worships
him
and
he
adores
her
do
know
where
he
hides
her
you
see
them
about
together
sometimes
at
concerts
for
instance
creature
she
is
plays
the
part
very
well
too
strange
affair
but
of
course
there
no
accounting
for
these
things
the
role
attracted
him
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
she
did
worship
him
utterly
he
did
not
analyse
his
feeling
for
her
perhaps
could
not
she
satisfied
something
in
him
that
was
profound
she
never
offended
his
sensibilities
nor
wearied
him
her
manners
were
excellent
her
gestures
full
of
grace
and
modesty
her
temperament
extreme
a
unique
combination
and
if
the
tie
between
them
was
not
real
and
secure
why
should
he
have
yearned
for
her
company
that
night
after
the
scenes
with
concepcion
and
queen
those
women
challenged
him
discomposed
him
fretted
him
fought
him
left
his
nerves
raw
she
soothed
why
should
he
not
in
the
french
phrase
put
her
among
her
own
furniture
in
a
proper
artistic
environment
an
environment
created
by
himself
of
taste
and
moderate
luxury
she
would
be
exquisite
she
would
blossom
and
she
would
blossom
for
him
alone
she
would
live
for
his
footstep
on
her
threshold
and
when
he
was
not
there
she
would
dream
amid
cushions
like
a
cat
in
the
right
environment
she
would
become
another
being
that
was
to
say
the
same
being
but
orchidised
and
when
he
was
old
when
he
was
she
would
still
be
young
still
be
under
forty
and
seductive
and
the
publishing
of
his
last
will
and
testament
under
which
she
inherited
all
would
render
her
famous
throughout
all
the
west
end
and
the
word
romance
would
spring
to
every
lip
he
searched
in
his
mind
for
the
location
of
suitable
flats
is
it
true
that
thou
didst
carry
me
in
thine
arms
repeated
christine
he
murmured
into
her
mouth
is
it
true
can
she
doubt
the
proof
then
and
he
picked
her
up
as
though
she
had
been
a
doll
and
carried
her
into
the
bedroom
as
she
lay
on
the
bed
she
raised
her
arm
and
looked
at
the
broken
and
sighed
my
mascot
it
is
not
a
my
mascot
shortly
afterwards
she
began
to
cry
again
at
first
gently
then
sobs
supervened
she
must
sleep
he
said
firmly
she
shook
her
head
i
can
not
i
have
been
too
upset
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
sleep
she
must
go
and
buy
me
a
drug
if
i
go
and
buy
her
a
drug
will
she
undress
and
get
into
bed
while
i
am
away
she
nodded
calling
marthe
and
taking
the
of
the
he
went
to
his
chemist
in
dover
street
and
bought
some
potassium
bromide
and
sal
volatile
when
he
came
back
marthe
whispered
to
him
she
sleeps
she
has
told
me
everything
as
i
undressed
her
the
poor
child
chapter
braiding
went
home
at
once
partly
so
that
christine
should
not
be
disturbed
partly
because
he
desired
solitude
in
order
to
examine
and
compose
his
mind
braiding
had
left
an
agreeable
modest
fire
fit
for
cold
april
in
the
he
had
just
sat
down
in
front
of
it
and
was
tranquillising
himself
in
the
familiar
harmonious
beauty
of
the
apartment
which
however
did
seem
rather
insipid
after
the
decorative
excesses
of
queen
room
when
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
little
stairway
from
the
upper
floor
braiding
entered
the
this
was
a
braiding
very
different
from
the
braiding
of
a
shameless
creature
of
more
rounded
contours
than
of
old
and
not
quite
so
spick
and
span
as
of
old
she
was
carrying
in
her
arms
that
which
before
the
war
she
could
not
have
conceived
herself
as
carrying
the
being
was
invisible
in
wraps
but
it
was
there
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
shame
for
it
seemed
indeed
to
be
proud
of
it
and
defiant
about
it
braiding
military
career
had
been
full
of
surprises
he
had
expected
within
a
few
months
of
joining
the
colours
to
be
dashing
gloriously
and
homicidally
at
germans
across
the
plains
of
flanders
to
be
in
fact
saving
the
empire
at
the
muzzle
of
rifle
and
the
point
of
bayonet
in
truth
he
found
that
for
interminable
innumerable
weeks
his
job
was
to
save
the
empire
by
cleaning
harness
on
the
east
coast
of
england
for
under
advice
he
had
transferred
to
the
artillery
later
when
his
true
qualifications
were
discovered
he
had
to
save
the
empire
by
polishing
the
buttons
and
serving
the
morning
tea
and
buying
the
cigarettes
of
a
major
who
in
had
been
a
lawyer
by
profession
and
a
soldier
only
for
fun
the
major
talked
too
much
and
to
the
wrong
people
he
became
lyric
concerning
the
talents
of
braiding
to
a
dandiacal
divisional
general
at
colchester
and
soon
by
the
actuating
of
mysterious
forces
and
the
filling
up
of
many
army
forms
braiding
was
removed
to
colchester
and
had
to
save
the
empire
by
valeting
the
divisonal
general
foiled
in
one
direction
braiding
advanced
in
another
by
tradition
when
a
valet
marries
a
lady
maid
the
effect
on
the
is
naught
and
it
is
certain
that
but
for
the
war
braiding
would
not
have
permitted
himself
to
act
as
he
did
the
empire
however
needed
citizens
the
first
rumour
that
braiding
had
done
what
in
him
lay
to
meet
the
need
spread
through
the
kitchens
of
the
albany
like
a
new
gospel
incredible
and
stupefying
but
which
imposed
itself
the
albany
was
never
the
same
again
all
the
kitchens
were
agreed
that
hoape
would
soon
be
stranded
the
spectacle
of
braiding
as
she
slipped
out
of
a
morning
past
the
porter
lodge
mesmerised
beholders
at
last
when
things
had
reached
the
limit
braiding
slipped
out
and
did
not
come
back
meanwhile
a
much
younger
sister
of
hers
had
been
introduced
into
the
flat
but
when
braiding
went
the
virgin
went
also
the
flat
was
more
or
less
closed
and
hoape
had
slept
at
his
club
for
weeks
at
length
the
flat
was
reopened
but
whereas
three
had
left
it
four
returned
that
a
bachelor
of
hoape
fastidiousness
should
tolerate
in
his
home
a
woman
with
a
tiny
baby
was
remarkable
it
was
as
astounding
perhaps
as
any
phenomenon
of
the
war
and
a
sublime
proof
that
hoape
realised
that
the
empire
was
fighting
for
its
life
it
arose
from
the
fact
that
both
and
braiding
were
men
of
considerable
sagacity
braiding
had
issued
an
order
after
seeing
that
his
wife
should
not
leave
service
and
braiding
too
had
her
sense
of
duty
she
was
very
proud
of
and
would
have
thought
it
disloyal
to
leave
him
in
the
lurch
and
so
possibly
prejudice
the
especially
as
she
was
convinced
that
he
would
never
get
anybody
else
comparable
to
herself
at
first
she
had
been
a
little
apologetic
and
diffident
about
her
offspring
but
soon
the
had
established
an
important
position
in
the
flat
and
though
he
was
generally
invisible
his
individuality
pervaded
the
whole
place
had
easily
got
accustomed
to
the
new
inhabitant
he
tolerated
and
then
liked
the
babe
he
had
never
nursed
it
for
such
an
act
would
have
been
excessive
but
he
had
once
stuck
his
finger
in
its
mouth
and
he
had
given
it
a
perambulator
that
folded
up
he
did
venture
secretly
to
hope
that
braiding
would
not
imagine
it
to
be
his
duty
to
provide
further
for
the
needs
of
the
empire
that
braiding
had
grown
rather
shameless
in
motherhood
was
shown
by
her
quite
casual
demeanour
as
she
now
came
into
the
with
the
baby
for
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
come
into
the
with
the
baby
knowing
her
august
master
to
be
there
braiding
said
that
child
ought
to
be
asleep
he
is
asleep
sir
said
the
woman
glancing
into
the
mysteries
of
the
immortal
package
but
maria
has
been
able
to
get
back
yet
because
of
the
raid
and
i
did
want
to
leave
him
upstairs
alone
with
the
cat
he
slept
all
through
the
raid
it
seems
some
of
you
have
made
the
cellar
quite
comfortable
oh
yes
sir
particularly
now
with
the
oilstove
and
the
carpet
perhaps
one
night
you
come
down
sir
i
may
have
to
i
should
have
been
much
surprised
to
find
some
damage
here
they
been
very
close
you
know
near
leicester
square
he
could
not
be
troubled
to
say
more
than
that
have
they
really
sir
it
just
like
them
said
braiding
and
she
then
continued
in
exactly
the
same
tone
lady
queenie
paulle
has
just
been
telephoning
from
lechford
house
sir
she
still
despite
her
marvellous
experiences
impishly
loved
to
make
extraordinary
announcements
as
if
they
were
nothing
at
all
and
she
felt
an
uplifted
satisfaction
in
having
talked
to
lady
queenie
paulle
herself
on
the
telephone
what
does
want
asked
impatiently
and
not
at
all
in
a
voice
proper
for
the
mention
of
a
lady
queenie
to
a
braiding
he
was
annoyed
he
resented
any
disturbance
of
the
repose
which
he
so
acutely
needed
braiding
showed
that
she
was
a
little
shocked
the
old
harassed
look
of
bearing
up
against
complex
anxieties
came
into
her
face
her
ladyship
wished
to
speak
to
you
sir
on
a
matter
of
importance
i
did
know
you
were
sir
that
last
phrase
was
always
used
by
braiding
when
she
wished
to
imply
that
she
could
guess
where
had
been
he
did
not
suppose
that
she
was
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
his
amour
but
he
had
a
suspicion
amounting
to
conviction
that
she
had
conjectured
it
as
men
of
science
from
certain
derangements
in
their
calculations
will
conjecture
the
existence
of
a
star
that
no
telescope
has
revealed
well
better
leave
lady
queenie
alone
for
i
promised
her
ladyship
that
i
would
ring
her
up
again
in
any
case
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
was
approximately
ten
minutes
ago
he
could
not
say
be
hanged
to
your
promises
reluctantly
he
went
to
the
telephone
himself
and
learnt
from
lady
queenie
who
always
knew
everything
that
the
raiders
were
expected
to
return
in
about
half
an
hour
and
that
she
and
concepcion
desired
his
presence
at
lechford
house
he
replied
coldly
that
he
was
too
tired
to
come
and
was
indeed
practically
in
bed
but
you
must
come
you
understand
we
want
you
said
lady
queenie
autocratically
adding
and
do
forget
that
business
about
the
hospitals
we
did
attend
to
it
this
afternoon
you
know
he
said
to
himself
and
whose
fault
was
that
and
went
off
angrily
wondering
what
mysterious
power
of
convention
it
was
that
compelled
him
to
respond
to
the
whim
of
a
girl
whom
he
scarcely
even
respected
chapter
the
roof
the
main
door
of
lechford
house
was
ajar
and
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
marble
of
the
porch
it
opened
robin
the
secretary
stood
at
the
threshold
evidently
she
had
been
set
to
wait
for
him
the
are
all
in
the
cellars
said
she
perkily
retorted
with
sardonic
bitterness
and
quite
right
too
i
glad
someone
got
some
sense
left
yet
he
did
not
really
admire
the
for
being
in
the
cellars
somehow
it
seemed
mean
of
them
not
to
be
ready
to
take
any
risks
however
unnecessary
robin
hiding
her
surprise
and
confusion
in
a
nervous
snigger
banged
the
heavy
door
and
led
him
through
the
halls
and
up
the
staircases
as
she
went
forward
she
turned
on
electric
lamps
here
and
there
in
advance
turning
them
off
by
the
alternative
switches
after
she
had
passed
them
so
that
in
the
vast
shadowed
echoing
interior
the
two
appeared
to
be
preceded
by
light
and
pursued
by
a
tide
of
darkness
she
was
mincingly
feminine
and
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
was
a
fine
gentleman
in
the
afternoon
and
again
at
first
he
had
taken
her
for
a
mere
girl
but
as
she
halted
under
a
lamp
to
hold
a
door
for
him
at
the
entrance
to
the
upper
stairs
he
perceived
that
it
must
have
been
a
long
time
since
she
was
a
girl
often
had
he
warned
himself
that
the
fashion
of
short
skirts
and
revealed
stockings
gave
a
deceiving
youthfulness
to
the
and
yet
nearly
every
day
he
had
to
learn
the
lesson
afresh
he
was
just
expecting
to
be
shown
into
the
boudoir
when
robin
stopped
at
a
very
small
door
her
ladyship
and
carlos
smith
are
out
on
the
roof
this
is
the
ladder
she
said
and
illuminated
the
ladder
had
no
choice
but
to
mount
luckily
he
had
kept
his
hat
he
put
it
on
as
he
climbed
he
felt
a
slight
recurrence
of
the
pain
in
his
side
which
he
had
noticed
in
martin
street
the
roof
was
a
very
strange
tempestuous
place
and
insecure
he
had
an
impression
similar
to
that
of
being
at
sea
for
the
wind
which
he
had
scarcely
observed
in
the
street
made
melancholy
noises
in
the
new
protective
that
stretched
over
his
head
this
contrivance
fastened
on
thick
iron
stanchions
formed
a
sort
of
second
roof
and
was
a
very
solid
and
elaborate
affair
which
must
have
cost
much
money
the
upstreaming
light
from
the
was
suddenly
extinguished
he
could
see
nobody
and
the
loneliness
was
uncomfortable
somehow
when
robin
had
announced
that
the
ladies
were
on
the
roof
he
had
imagined
the
roof
as
a
large
flat
expanse
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
so
far
as
he
could
distinguish
in
the
deep
gloom
it
had
leaden
pathways
but
on
either
hand
it
sloped
sharply
up
or
sharply
down
he
might
have
fallen
sheer
into
a
chasm
or
stumbled
against
the
leaden
side
of
a
slant
he
descried
a
lofty
construction
of
carved
masonry
with
an
iron
ladder
clamped
into
it
far
transcending
the
net
not
immediately
did
he
comprehend
that
it
was
merely
one
of
the
famous
lechford
looming
gigantic
in
the
night
he
walked
cautiously
onward
and
came
to
a
precipice
and
drew
back
startled
and
took
another
pathway
at
right
angles
to
the
first
one
presently
the
protective
netting
stopped
and
he
was
exposed
to
heaven
he
had
reached
the
roof
of
the
servants
quarters
towards
the
back
of
the
house
he
stood
still
and
gazed
accustoming
himself
to
the
night
the
moon
was
concealed
but
there
were
patches
of
dim
stars
he
could
make
out
across
the
empty
green
park
the
huge
silhouette
of
buckingham
palace
and
beyond
that
the
tower
of
westminster
cathedral
to
his
left
he
could
see
part
of
a
courtyard
or
small
square
with
a
black
figure
no
doubt
a
policeman
carrying
a
the
mall
seemed
to
be
utterly
deserted
but
piccadilly
showed
a
line
of
faint
stationary
lights
and
still
fainter
moving
lights
a
mild
hum
and
the
sounds
of
and
came
from
piccadilly
where
people
were
abroad
in
ignorance
that
the
raid
was
not
really
over
all
the
heavens
were
continually
restless
with
long
shifting
rays
from
the
stations
but
the
rays
served
only
to
prove
the
power
of
darkness
then
he
heard
quick
smooth
footsteps
two
figures
one
behind
the
other
approached
him
almost
running
eagerly
girlishly
with
little
cries
the
first
was
queen
who
wore
a
white
skirt
and
a
very
black
jersey
concepcion
also
wore
a
white
skirt
and
a
very
black
jersey
but
with
a
long
mantle
hung
loosely
from
the
shoulders
both
were
bareheaded
is
it
splendid
queen
burst
out
enthusiastically
again
had
the
sensation
of
being
at
sea
perhaps
on
the
deck
of
a
yacht
he
felt
that
rain
ought
to
have
been
beating
on
the
face
of
the
excited
and
careless
girl
before
answering
he
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
overcoat
then
he
said
wo
you
catch
a
chill
i
never
cold
said
queen
it
was
true
i
shall
always
come
up
here
for
raids
in
future
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
it
i
love
it
i
love
it
i
only
thought
of
it
it
the
next
best
thing
to
being
a
man
and
being
at
the
front
it
being
at
the
front
her
face
was
little
more
than
a
pale
featureless
oval
to
him
in
the
gloom
but
he
could
divine
from
the
vibrations
of
her
voice
that
she
was
as
ecstatic
as
a
young
maid
at
her
first
dance
and
what
about
that
business
interview
that
you
just
asked
for
on
the
acidly
demanded
oh
we
come
to
that
later
we
wanted
a
man
here
not
to
save
us
only
to
save
us
from
ourselves
and
you
were
the
best
we
could
think
of
was
he
con
but
you
not
heard
about
my
next
bazaar
have
you
i
thought
it
was
a
pageant
i
mean
after
that
a
bazaar
i
do
know
yet
what
it
will
be
for
but
i
got
lots
of
the
most
topping
ideas
for
it
for
instance
going
to
have
a
station
what
for
casualties
queen
scorned
his
obtuseness
pouring
out
a
cataract
of
swift
sentences
no
to
lovely
complexions
help
for
distressed
beauties
i
shall
get
roger
fry
to
design
the
station
and
the
costumes
of
my
attendants
it
will
be
marvellous
and
i
tell
you
there
always
be
a
queue
waiting
for
admittance
i
shall
have
all
the
latest
dodges
in
the
sublime
and
fatal
art
of
and
if
any
of
the
bond
street
gang
refuse
to
help
me
i
damn
well
ruin
them
but
they
wo
refuse
because
they
know
what
i
do
gontran
is
coming
in
with
his
new
steaming
process
for
waving
con
you
must
try
that
it
a
miracle
waving
no
good
for
my
style
of
coiffure
but
it
would
suit
you
you
always
would
wave
but
you
got
to
now
my
seraph
the
electric
heater
works
in
sections
no
danger
no
inconvenience
to
the
poor
old
scalp
the
waves
will
last
for
six
months
or
more
it
has
to
be
seen
to
be
believed
and
even
then
you
ca
believe
it
its
only
fault
is
that
it
too
natural
to
be
natural
but
who
wants
to
be
natural
this
modern
craze
for
naturalness
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
unwholesome
not
to
say
perverted
what
she
seized
arm
convulsively
concepcion
had
said
nothing
sought
her
eyes
in
the
darkness
but
did
not
find
them
so
much
for
the
bazaar
he
said
queen
suddenly
cried
aloud
what
is
it
robin
has
captain
brickly
telephoned
yes
my
lady
came
a
voice
faintly
across
the
gloom
from
the
region
of
the
they
coming
they
be
here
directly
exclaimed
queen
loosing
and
clapping
her
hands
thought
of
robin
affixed
to
the
telephone
and
some
officer
at
the
war
office
quitting
duty
for
the
telephone
in
order
to
keep
the
capricious
girl
informed
of
military
movements
simply
because
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
be
her
daughter
and
in
so
doing
had
acquired
the
right
to
treat
the
imperial
machine
as
one
of
her
nursery
toys
and
he
became
unreasonably
annoyed
i
suppose
you
were
cowering
in
your
club
during
the
first
act
she
said
with
vivacity
yes
briefly
answered
once
more
he
was
aware
of
a
strong
instinctive
disinclination
to
relate
what
had
happened
to
him
he
was
too
proud
to
explain
and
perhaps
too
tired
you
ought
to
have
been
up
here
they
dropped
two
bombs
close
to
the
national
gallery
pity
they
could
have
destroyed
a
landseer
or
two
while
they
were
so
near
there
were
either
seven
or
eight
killed
and
eighteen
wounded
so
far
as
is
known
but
there
were
probably
more
there
was
quite
a
fire
too
but
that
was
soon
got
under
we
saw
it
all
except
the
explosion
of
the
bombs
we
were
looking
in
the
right
place
no
luck
however
we
saw
the
zepp
what
a
shame
the
disappeared
again
listen
listen
ca
you
hear
the
engines
shrugged
his
shoulders
nothing
could
be
heard
above
the
faint
hum
of
piccadilly
the
wind
seemed
to
have
diminished
to
a
chill
fitful
zephyr
concepcion
had
sat
down
on
a
coping
look
she
exclaimed
in
a
startled
whisper
and
sprang
erect
to
the
south
down
among
the
trees
a
red
light
flashed
and
was
gone
the
faint
irregular
hum
of
piccadilly
persisted
for
a
couple
of
seconds
and
then
was
drowned
in
the
loud
report
which
seemed
to
linger
and
wander
in
the
great
open
spaces
flesh
crept
he
comprehended
the
mad
ecstasy
of
queen
and
because
he
comprehended
it
his
anger
against
her
increased
can
you
see
the
zepp
murmured
queen
as
it
were
ferociously
it
must
be
within
range
or
they
would
have
fired
look
along
the
lines
of
the
searchlights
one
of
them
at
any
rate
must
have
got
on
to
it
we
saw
it
before
ca
you
see
it
i
can
hear
the
engines
i
think
another
flash
was
followed
by
another
resounding
report
more
guns
spoke
in
the
distance
then
a
glare
arose
on
the
southern
horizon
incendiary
bomb
muttered
queen
she
stood
with
her
mouth
open
entranced
the
zeppelin
or
the
zeppelins
remained
invisible
and
inaudible
yet
they
must
be
aloft
there
somewhere
amid
the
of
the
unresting
searchlights
waited
powerfully
impressed
incapable
of
any
direct
action
gazing
blankly
now
at
the
women
and
now
at
the
huge
undecipherable
heaven
and
earth
and
receiving
the
chill
zephyr
on
his
face
the
nearmost
gun
had
ceased
to
fire
occasionally
there
was
perfect
silence
for
no
faintest
hum
came
from
piccadilly
and
nothing
seemed
to
move
there
the
further
guns
recommenced
and
then
the
group
heard
a
new
sound
rather
like
the
sound
of
a
taxi
accelerating
before
changing
gear
it
grew
gradually
louder
it
grew
very
loud
it
seemed
to
be
ripping
the
envelope
of
the
air
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
last
for
ever
till
it
finished
with
a
gigantic
and
intimidating
quite
near
the
front
of
lechford
house
queen
said
shrapnel
and
a
big
lump
could
see
the
quick
heave
of
her
bosom
imprisoned
in
the
black
she
was
breathing
through
her
nostrils
come
downstairs
into
the
house
he
said
sharply
more
than
sharply
brutally
where
in
the
name
of
god
is
the
sense
of
stopping
up
here
are
you
both
mad
queen
laughed
lightly
oh
how
funny
you
are
i
really
surprised
you
have
left
london
for
good
before
now
by
rights
you
ought
to
belong
to
the
brigade
do
you
know
what
they
do
they
take
a
ticket
to
any
station
north
or
west
and
when
they
get
out
of
the
train
they
run
to
the
nearest
house
and
interview
the
tenant
has
he
any
accommodation
to
let
will
he
take
them
in
as
boarders
will
he
take
them
as
paying
guests
will
he
let
the
house
furnished
will
he
let
it
unfurnished
will
he
allow
them
to
camp
out
in
the
stables
will
he
sell
the
blooming
house
so
there
is
a
house
to
be
had
on
the
north
western
nearer
than
leighton
buzzard
are
you
going
because
i
am
said
concepcion
murmured
do
go
i
shall
go
and
so
will
you
both
of
you
queen
mocked
him
you
in
a
funk
i
got
courage
enough
to
go
anyhow
said
he
and
that
more
than
you
have
you
losing
your
temper
as
a
fact
he
was
he
grabbed
at
queen
but
she
easily
escaped
him
he
saw
the
whiteness
of
her
skirt
in
the
distance
of
the
roof
dimly
rising
she
was
climbing
the
ladder
up
the
side
of
the
chimney
she
stood
on
the
top
of
the
chimney
and
laughed
again
a
gun
sounded
said
no
more
using
his
he
found
his
way
to
the
and
descended
he
was
in
the
warm
and
sheltered
interior
of
the
house
he
was
in
another
and
a
saner
world
robin
was
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
she
blinked
under
his
lamp
i
had
enough
of
that
he
said
and
followed
her
to
the
illuminated
boudoir
where
after
a
certain
hesitation
she
left
him
alone
in
the
boudoir
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
very
shamed
and
futile
person
and
he
was
still
extremely
angry
the
next
moment
concepcion
entered
the
boudoir
ah
he
murmured
curiously
appeased
you
quite
right
said
concepcion
simply
he
said
can
you
give
me
any
reason
con
why
we
should
make
a
present
of
ourselves
to
the
hun
concepcion
repeated
you
quite
right
is
she
coming
concepcion
made
a
negative
sign
she
does
know
what
fear
is
queen
does
she
does
know
what
sense
is
she
ought
to
be
whipped
and
if
i
got
hold
of
her
i
whip
her
she
like
nothing
better
said
concepcion
removed
his
overcoat
and
sat
down
chapter
in
the
boudoir
we
are
so
desperately
safe
even
here
said
firmly
pursuing
the
moral
triumph
which
concepcion
very
surprising
and
comforting
descent
from
the
roof
had
given
him
do
go
to
extremes
she
answered
no
i
wo
he
thought
of
the
valetry
in
the
cellars
and
the
impossible
humiliation
of
joining
them
and
added
i
merely
state
then
after
a
moment
of
silence
by
the
way
was
it
only
idea
that
i
should
come
along
or
did
the
command
come
from
both
of
you
the
suspicion
of
some
dark
feminine
conspiracy
revisited
him
it
was
queen
idea
oh
well
i
do
quite
understand
the
psychology
of
it
surely
that
plain
it
is
in
the
least
plain
concepcion
loosed
and
dropped
her
cloak
and
not
even
glancing
at
went
to
the
fire
and
teased
it
with
the
poker
bending
down
with
one
hand
on
the
graphic
and
didactic
mantelpiece
and
staring
into
the
fire
she
said
queen
in
love
with
you
of
course
the
words
were
a
genuine
shock
to
his
sarcastic
and
rather
embittered
and
bullying
mood
was
he
to
believe
them
the
vibrant
uttering
voice
was
convincing
enough
was
he
to
show
the
conventional
incredulity
proper
to
such
an
occasion
or
was
he
to
be
natural
brutally
natural
he
was
drawn
first
to
one
course
and
then
to
the
other
and
finally
spoke
at
random
by
instinct
what
have
i
been
doing
to
deserve
this
concepcion
replied
still
looking
into
the
fire
as
far
as
i
can
gather
it
must
be
your
masterful
ways
at
the
hospital
committee
that
have
impressed
her
and
especially
your
tyrannical
methods
with
her
august
mother
i
see
thanks
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
treated
the
marchioness
tyrannically
he
treated
her
like
anybody
else
he
now
perceived
that
this
was
to
treat
her
tyrannically
his
imagination
leapt
forward
as
he
gazed
round
the
weird
and
exciting
room
which
queen
had
brought
into
existence
for
the
illustration
of
herself
and
as
he
pictured
the
slim
pale
figure
outside
clinging
in
the
night
to
the
vast
chimney
and
as
he
listened
to
the
faint
intermittent
thud
of
guns
he
had
a
spasm
of
delicious
temptation
he
was
tempted
by
connections
and
her
prospective
wealth
if
anybody
was
to
possess
millions
after
the
war
queen
would
one
day
possess
millions
her
family
and
her
innumerable
powerful
relatives
would
be
compelled
to
accept
him
without
the
slightest
reserve
for
queen
issued
edicts
and
through
all
those
big
people
he
would
acquire
immense
prestige
and
influence
which
he
could
use
greatly
ambition
flared
up
in
him
ambition
to
impress
himself
on
his
era
and
he
reflected
with
satisfaction
on
the
strangeness
of
the
fact
that
such
an
opportunity
should
have
come
to
him
the
son
of
a
lawyer
solely
by
virtue
of
his
own
individuality
he
thought
of
christine
and
poor
little
christine
was
shrunk
to
nothing
at
all
she
was
scarcely
even
an
object
of
compassion
she
was
a
prostitute
but
far
more
than
by
queen
connections
and
prospective
wealth
he
was
tempted
by
her
youth
and
beauty
he
saw
her
beautiful
and
girlish
and
he
was
sexually
tempted
most
of
all
he
was
tempted
by
the
desire
to
master
her
he
saw
again
the
foolish
elegant
brilliant
thing
on
the
chimney
pretending
to
defy
him
and
mock
at
him
and
he
heard
himself
commanding
sharply
come
down
come
down
and
acknowledge
your
ruler
come
down
and
be
whipped
for
had
he
not
been
told
that
she
would
like
nothing
better
and
he
heard
the
west
end
of
london
and
all
the
saying
she
obeys
like
a
slave
he
conceived
a
new
and
dazzling
environment
for
himself
and
it
was
undeniable
that
he
needed
something
of
the
kind
for
he
was
growing
lonely
before
the
war
he
had
lived
intensely
in
his
younger
friends
but
the
war
had
taken
nearly
all
of
them
away
from
him
many
of
them
for
ever
then
he
said
in
a
voice
almost
resentfully
satiric
and
wondered
why
such
a
tone
should
come
from
his
lips
another
of
her
caprices
no
doubt
what
do
you
mean
another
of
her
caprices
said
concepcion
straightening
herself
and
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
he
had
noticed
only
a
moment
earlier
on
the
mantelpiece
a
large
photograph
of
the
handsome
molder
with
some
writing
under
it
well
what
about
that
for
example
he
pointed
concepcion
glanced
at
him
for
the
first
time
and
her
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
his
finger
that
i
do
know
anything
about
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
while
you
were
gossiping
till
five
this
morning
you
two
she
did
mention
it
she
did
went
right
on
murmuring
wants
to
do
something
unusual
wants
to
astonish
the
town
no
no
then
you
seriously
tell
me
she
fallen
in
love
with
me
con
i
have
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
did
she
say
so
there
was
a
sound
outside
the
door
they
both
started
like
plotters
in
danger
and
tried
to
look
as
if
they
had
been
discussing
the
weather
or
the
war
but
no
interruption
occurred
well
she
did
i
know
i
shall
be
thought
mischievous
if
she
had
the
faintest
notion
i
breathed
the
least
hint
to
you
she
quarrel
with
me
eternally
of
course
i
could
bear
another
quarrel
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
but
you
i
would
have
said
a
word
but
different
from
anybody
else
and
i
could
help
it
you
do
know
what
queen
is
queen
a
white
woman
so
you
said
this
afternoon
and
so
she
is
she
has
the
most
curious
and
interesting
brain
and
she
as
straight
as
a
man
i
never
noticed
it
but
i
know
i
know
and
she
an
exquisite
companion
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
i
expect
the
scheme
is
that
i
am
to
make
love
to
her
and
be
worried
out
of
my
life
and
then
propose
to
her
and
she
accept
me
the
word
scheme
brought
up
again
his
suspicion
of
a
conspiracy
evidently
there
was
no
conspiracy
but
there
was
a
plot
of
one
a
nervous
breakdown
was
concepcion
merely
under
an
illusion
that
she
had
had
a
nervous
breakdown
or
had
she
in
truth
had
one
and
was
this
singular
interview
a
result
of
it
concepcion
continued
with
surprising
calm
magnanimity
i
know
her
mind
is
strange
but
it
lovely
no
one
but
me
has
ever
seen
into
it
she
following
her
instinct
unconsciously
as
we
all
do
you
know
and
her
instinct
right
in
spite
of
everything
her
instinct
telling
her
just
now
that
she
needs
a
master
and
exactly
what
she
does
need
we
must
remember
she
very
young
yes
interrupted
bursting
out
with
a
kind
of
savagery
that
he
could
not
explain
yes
she
young
and
she
finds
even
my
age
spicy
there
be
something
quite
amusingly
piquant
for
her
in
marrying
a
man
nearly
thirty
years
her
senior
concepcion
advanced
towards
him
there
she
stood
in
front
of
him
quite
close
to
his
chair
gazing
down
at
him
in
her
tight
black
jersey
and
short
white
skirt
she
was
wearing
black
stockings
now
her
serious
face
was
perfectly
unruffled
and
in
her
worn
face
was
all
her
experience
all
the
nights
and
days
on
the
clyde
were
in
her
face
the
scalping
of
the
young
glasgow
girl
was
in
her
face
and
the
failure
to
endure
either
in
work
or
in
love
there
was
complete
silence
within
and
without
not
the
echo
of
an
echo
of
a
gun
felt
as
though
he
were
at
bay
she
said
people
like
you
and
queen
do
want
to
bother
about
age
neither
of
you
has
any
age
and
i
not
imploring
you
to
have
her
i
only
telling
you
that
she
there
for
you
if
you
want
her
but
she
attract
you
is
she
positively
irresistible
she
added
with
poignancy
i
know
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
find
her
irresistible
just
so
a
look
of
sacrifice
came
into
concepcion
eyes
as
she
finished
i
do
anything
anything
to
make
queen
happy
yes
you
would
retorted
icily
carried
away
by
a
ruthless
and
inexorable
impulse
you
do
anything
to
make
her
happy
even
for
three
months
yes
to
make
her
happy
for
three
weeks
you
be
ready
to
ruin
my
whole
life
i
know
you
and
queen
and
the
mild
image
of
christine
formed
in
his
mind
soothingly
infinitely
desirable
what
balm
after
the
contact
of
these
incalculable
creatures
concepcion
retired
with
a
gesture
of
the
arm
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
you
terrible
she
said
wistfully
queen
would
be
thrown
away
on
you
but
you
be
thrown
away
on
her
i
admit
it
i
think
you
had
it
in
you
i
never
saw
a
man
develop
as
you
have
marriage
is
for
you
you
ought
to
roam
in
the
primeval
forest
and
take
and
kill
not
a
bit
said
appeased
once
more
not
a
bit
but
the
new
relations
of
the
sexes
are
in
my
line
my
poor
boy
are
you
so
ingenuous
after
all
there
nothing
very
new
in
the
relations
of
the
sexes
that
i
know
of
they
much
what
they
were
in
the
garden
of
eden
what
do
you
know
of
the
garden
of
eden
i
get
my
information
from
milton
she
replied
cheerfully
as
though
much
relieved
have
you
read
then
con
i
read
it
all
through
in
my
lodgings
and
it
really
rather
good
in
fact
the
remarks
of
raphael
to
adam
in
the
eighth
book
i
think
it
is
are
still
just
about
the
last
word
on
the
relations
of
the
sexes
nothing
profits
more
than
grounded
on
just
and
right
of
that
skill
the
more
thou
the
more
she
will
acknowledge
thee
her
head
to
realities
yield
all
her
marvelling
exclaimed
with
sudden
enthusiasm
by
jove
you
an
astounding
woman
con
you
do
me
good
there
was
a
fresh
noise
beyond
the
door
and
the
door
opened
and
robin
rushed
in
blanched
and
hysterical
and
with
her
seemed
to
rush
in
terror
oh
madame
she
cried
as
there
was
no
more
firing
i
went
on
to
the
roof
and
her
ladyship
she
covered
her
face
and
sobbed
jumped
up
go
and
see
said
concepcion
in
a
blank
voice
not
moving
i
ca
it
the
message
straight
from
potsdam
that
arrived
chapter
queen
dead
emerged
from
the
crowded
and
malodorous
coroner
court
with
a
deep
sense
of
the
rigour
and
the
thoroughness
of
british
justice
and
especially
of
its
stolidity
there
had
been
four
inquests
all
upon
the
bodies
of
victims
a
his
wife
an
orphan
baby
all
belonging
to
the
thick
central
mass
of
the
proletariat
for
a
west
end
slum
had
received
a
bomb
full
in
the
face
and
lady
queenie
paulle
the
policemen
were
stolid
the
reporters
were
stolid
the
proletariat
was
stolid
the
majority
of
the
witnesses
were
stolid
and
in
particular
the
representatives
of
various
philanthropic
agencies
who
gave
the
most
minute
evidence
about
the
habits
and
circumstances
of
the
slum
and
the
jurymen
were
very
stolid
and
never
more
so
than
when
with
stubby
fingers
holding
ancient
pens
they
had
to
sign
quantities
of
blue
forms
under
the
strict
guidance
of
a
bareheaded
policeman
the
world
of
queenie
acquaintances
made
a
strange
vivid
contrast
to
this
grey
grim
blockish
world
and
the
two
worlds
regarded
each
other
with
the
wonder
and
the
suspicious
resentment
of
foreigners
queen
world
came
expecting
to
behave
as
at
a
cause
célèbre
of
for
example
divorce
its
representatives
were
quite
ready
to
tolerate
unpleasing
contacts
and
long
stretches
of
tedium
in
return
for
some
glimpse
of
the
squalid
and
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
say
that
they
had
been
present
at
the
inquest
but
most
of
them
had
arrived
rather
late
and
they
had
reckoned
without
the
coroner
and
comparatively
few
obtained
even
admittance
the
coroner
had
arrived
on
the
stroke
of
the
hour
in
a
silk
hat
and
frock
coat
with
a
black
bag
and
had
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
begun
to
rule
the
proceedings
with
an
absolutism
that
no
high
court
judge
would
have
attempted
he
was
autocrat
in
a
small
close
sordid
room
but
he
was
autocrat
he
had
already
shown
his
quality
in
some
indirect
collisions
with
the
marquis
of
lechford
the
marquis
felt
that
he
could
not
stomach
the
exposure
of
his
daughter
corpse
in
a
common
mortuary
with
other
corpses
of
he
knew
not
whom
long
experience
of
the
marquisate
had
taught
him
to
believe
that
everything
could
be
arranged
he
found
however
that
this
matter
could
not
be
arranged
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
ukase
of
the
coroner
then
he
wished
to
be
excused
from
giving
evidence
since
his
evidence
could
have
no
direct
bearing
on
the
death
but
he
was
informed
by
a
mere
clerk
who
had
knowledge
of
the
coroner
ways
that
if
he
did
not
attend
the
inquest
would
probably
be
adjourned
for
his
attendance
the
fact
was
the
coroner
had
appreciated
as
well
as
anybody
that
heaven
and
the
war
had
sent
him
a
cause
célèbre
of
the
he
saw
himself
the
supreme
being
of
a
unique
assize
he
saw
his
remarks
reproduced
verbatim
in
the
papers
for
though
localities
might
not
be
mentioned
there
was
no
censor
ban
upon
the
of
coroners
his
idiosyncrasy
was
that
he
hid
all
his
enjoyment
in
his
own
breast
even
had
he
had
the
use
of
a
bench
instead
of
a
mere
chair
he
would
never
have
allowed
titled
ladies
in
mirific
black
hats
to
share
it
with
him
he
was
an
icy
radical
sincere
competent
conscientious
and
vain
he
would
be
no
respecter
of
persons
but
he
was
a
disrespecter
of
persons
above
a
certain
social
rank
he
said
open
that
window
and
that
window
was
opened
regardless
of
the
identity
of
the
person
who
might
be
sitting
under
it
he
said
this
court
is
unhealthily
full
admit
no
more
and
no
more
could
be
admitted
though
the
entire
peerage
waited
without
the
marquis
had
considered
that
the
inquest
on
his
daughter
might
be
taken
first
the
other
three
cases
were
taken
first
and
even
taken
concurrently
they
occupied
an
immense
period
of
time
all
the
bodies
were
of
course
viewed
together
and
the
absence
of
the
jury
seemed
to
the
marquis
interminable
he
thought
the
despicable
tradesmen
were
gloating
unduly
over
the
damaged
face
of
his
daughter
the
coroner
had
been
marvellously
courteous
to
the
procession
of
humble
witnesses
he
could
not
have
been
more
courteous
to
the
exalted
and
he
was
not
in
the
sight
of
the
coroner
all
men
were
equal
encountered
him
first
i
did
my
best
to
persuade
her
ladyship
to
come
down
said
very
formally
i
am
quite
sure
you
did
said
the
coroner
with
the
dryest
politeness
and
you
failed
the
policeman
had
related
events
from
the
moment
when
had
fetched
him
in
from
the
street
the
policeman
could
remember
everything
what
everybody
had
said
the
positions
of
all
objects
the
characteristics
and
extent
of
the
the
exact
posture
of
the
deceased
girl
the
exact
minute
of
his
visit
he
and
the
coroner
played
to
each
other
like
actors
carlos
smith
ordeal
was
very
brief
and
the
coroner
dismissed
her
with
an
expression
of
sympathy
that
seemed
to
issue
from
his
mouth
like
carved
granite
with
the
doctor
alone
the
coroner
had
become
human
the
coroner
also
was
a
doctor
the
doctor
had
talked
about
a
relatively
slight
extravasation
of
blood
and
said
that
death
had
been
instantaneous
said
the
coroner
the
body
was
found
on
the
it
had
fallen
from
the
chimney
in
your
opinion
was
the
fall
a
contributory
cause
of
death
the
doctor
said
no
in
your
opinion
death
was
due
to
an
extremely
small
piece
of
shrapnel
which
struck
the
deceased
head
slightly
above
the
left
ear
entering
the
brain
the
doctor
said
yes
the
marquis
of
lechford
had
to
answer
questions
as
to
his
parental
relations
with
his
daughter
how
long
had
he
been
away
in
the
country
how
long
had
the
deceased
been
living
in
lechford
house
practically
alone
how
old
was
his
daughter
had
he
given
any
order
to
the
effect
that
nobody
was
to
be
on
the
roof
of
his
house
during
an
had
he
given
any
orders
at
all
as
to
conduct
during
an
the
coroner
sympathised
deeply
with
his
lordship
position
and
felt
sure
that
his
lordship
understood
that
but
his
lordship
would
also
understand
that
the
policy
of
heads
of
households
in
regard
to
had
more
than
a
domestic
interest
it
had
one
might
say
a
national
interest
and
the
force
of
prominent
example
was
one
of
the
forces
upon
which
the
government
counted
and
had
the
right
to
count
for
help
in
the
regulation
of
public
conduct
in
these
great
crises
of
the
most
gigantic
war
that
the
world
had
ever
seen
now
as
to
the
had
said
the
coroner
leaving
the
subject
of
the
force
of
example
he
had
a
perfect
plan
of
the
in
his
mind
he
understood
that
the
rose
higher
than
the
and
that
the
went
round
the
at
a
distance
of
a
foot
or
more
leaving
room
so
that
a
person
might
climb
up
the
perpendicular
ladder
if
a
person
fell
from
the
top
of
the
it
was
a
chance
whether
that
person
fell
on
the
or
through
the
space
between
the
and
the
chimney
on
to
the
roof
itself
the
jury
doubtless
understood
the
jury
however
at
that
instant
had
been
engaged
in
examining
the
bit
of
shrapnel
which
had
been
extracted
from
the
brain
of
the
only
daughter
of
a
marquis
the
coroner
understood
that
the
did
not
extend
over
the
whole
of
the
house
it
extends
over
all
the
main
part
of
the
house
his
lordship
had
replied
but
not
over
the
back
part
of
the
house
his
lordship
agreed
the
quarters
probably
his
lordship
nodded
the
coroner
had
said
the
does
not
extend
over
the
servants
quarters
in
a
very
even
voice
a
faint
hiss
in
court
had
been
extinguished
by
the
sharp
glare
of
the
coroner
eyes
his
lordship
a
thin
antique
figure
in
a
long
cloak
that
none
but
himself
would
have
ventured
to
wear
had
stepped
down
helpless
there
had
been
much
signing
of
depositions
the
coroner
had
spoken
of
the
hague
convention
mentioning
one
article
by
its
number
the
jury
as
to
the
first
three
cases
in
which
the
victims
had
been
killed
by
bombs
had
returned
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
the
kaiser
the
coroner
suppressing
the
applause
had
agreed
heartily
with
the
verdict
he
told
the
jury
that
the
fourth
case
was
different
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
death
from
shrapnel
they
gave
their
sympathy
to
all
the
relatives
and
added
a
rider
about
the
inadvisability
of
running
unnecessary
risks
and
the
coroner
once
more
agreeing
heartily
had
thereon
made
an
effective
little
speech
to
a
hushed
assenting
audience
there
were
several
outside
signalled
across
the
street
to
the
who
telephoned
every
morning
to
him
for
orders
he
had
never
owned
a
and
because
he
had
no
ambition
to
drive
himself
had
never
felt
the
desire
to
own
one
the
experienced
some
delay
in
starting
his
engine
lit
a
cigarette
concepcion
came
out
alone
he
had
expected
her
to
be
with
the
marquis
with
whom
she
had
arrived
she
was
dressed
in
mourning
only
on
that
day
and
once
before
on
the
day
of
her
husband
funeral
had
he
seen
her
in
mourning
she
looked
now
like
the
widow
she
was
nevertheless
he
had
not
quite
accustomed
himself
to
the
sight
of
her
in
mourning
i
wonder
whether
i
can
get
a
taxi
she
asked
you
can
have
mine
said
he
where
do
you
want
to
go
she
named
a
disconcerting
address
near
shepherd
market
at
that
moment
a
pressman
with
a
camera
came
boldly
up
and
snapped
her
the
man
had
the
brazen
demeanour
of
a
racecourse
tout
but
concepcion
seemed
not
to
mind
at
all
and
remembered
that
she
was
deeply
inured
to
publicity
her
portrait
had
already
appeared
in
the
picture
papers
along
with
that
of
queen
but
the
papers
had
deemed
it
necessary
to
remind
a
forgetful
public
that
carlos
smith
was
the
same
lady
as
the
concepcion
iquist
the
hesitated
for
an
instant
on
hearing
the
address
but
only
for
an
instant
he
had
earned
the
esteem
and
regular
patronage
of
by
a
curious
hazard
one
night
had
hailed
him
and
the
man
had
said
in
a
flash
without
waiting
for
the
fare
to
speak
the
albany
is
it
sir
i
drove
you
home
about
two
months
ago
thenceforward
he
had
been
for
the
perfect
in
the
taxi
concepcion
said
not
a
word
and
did
not
disturb
her
beneath
his
superficial
melancholy
he
was
sustained
by
the
mere
joy
of
being
alive
the
common
phenomena
of
the
streets
were
beautiful
to
him
concepcion
calm
and
grieved
vitality
seemed
mysteriously
exquisite
he
had
had
similar
sensations
while
walking
along
coventry
street
after
his
escape
from
the
explosion
of
the
bomb
fatigue
and
annoyance
and
sorrow
had
extinguished
them
for
a
time
but
now
that
the
episode
of
queen
tragedy
was
closed
they
were
born
anew
queen
the
pathetic
victim
of
the
indiscipline
of
her
own
impulses
was
gone
but
he
had
escaped
he
lived
and
life
was
an
affair
miraculous
and
lovely
i
think
i
been
here
before
said
he
when
they
got
out
of
the
taxi
in
a
short
untidy
indeterminate
street
that
was
a
the
prospect
ended
in
a
garage
near
which
two
women
chauffeurs
were
discussing
a
topic
that
interested
them
a
was
playing
close
by
and
a
few
ragged
children
stared
at
the
on
the
end
of
which
a
baby
was
cradled
the
fact
that
the
street
was
midway
between
curzon
street
and
piccadilly
and
almost
within
sight
of
the
monumental
new
mansion
of
an
american
duchess
explained
the
existence
of
the
building
in
front
of
which
the
taxi
had
stopped
the
entrance
to
the
flats
was
mean
and
soiled
it
repelled
but
concepcion
unapologetically
led
up
a
flight
of
four
stone
steps
and
round
a
curve
into
a
little
corridor
she
halted
at
a
door
on
the
ground
floor
yes
said
with
admirable
calm
i
do
believe
you
got
the
very
flat
i
once
looked
at
with
a
friend
of
mine
if
i
remember
it
did
fill
the
bill
because
the
tenant
would
it
unfurnished
when
did
you
get
hold
of
this
yesterday
afternoon
concepcion
answered
quick
work
but
these
feats
can
be
accomplished
i
only
taken
it
for
a
month
hotels
seem
to
be
all
full
i
could
open
my
own
place
at
a
moment
notice
and
i
did
mean
to
stay
on
at
lechford
house
even
if
they
asked
me
to
notion
of
the
vastness
and
safety
of
london
had
received
a
shock
he
was
now
a
very
busy
man
and
would
quite
sincerely
have
told
anybody
who
questioned
him
on
the
point
that
he
had
a
moment
to
call
his
own
nevertheless
on
the
previous
morning
he
had
spent
a
considerable
time
in
searching
for
a
nest
in
which
to
hide
his
christine
and
create
romance
and
he
had
come
to
this
very
flat
more
there
had
been
two
flats
to
let
in
the
block
he
had
declined
them
the
better
one
because
of
the
furniture
the
worse
because
it
was
impossibly
small
and
both
because
of
the
propinquity
of
the
garage
but
supposing
that
he
had
taken
one
and
concepcion
the
other
he
recoiled
at
the
thought
concepcion
new
home
if
not
impossibly
small
was
small
and
the
immensity
and
abundance
of
the
furniture
made
it
seem
smaller
than
it
actually
was
each
little
room
had
the
air
of
having
been
furnished
out
of
a
huge
and
expensive
emporium
no
single
style
prevailed
there
were
big
carved
and
inlaid
antique
cabinets
and
chests
big
hanging
crystal
candelabra
and
big
pictures
some
of
them
apparently
family
portraits
the
rest
in
big
gilt
frames
with
a
multiplicity
of
occasional
tables
and
gilt
predominated
the
ornate
cornices
were
gilded
human
beings
had
to
move
about
like
dwarfs
on
the
tiny
free
spaces
of
carpet
between
frowning
cabinetry
the
taste
and
the
aim
of
the
author
of
this
home
defied
deduction
in
the
first
room
a
charwoman
was
cleaning
concepcion
greeted
her
like
a
sister
in
the
next
room
whose
window
gave
on
to
a
blank
wall
tea
was
laid
for
one
in
front
of
a
concepcion
reached
down
a
cup
and
saucer
from
a
glazed
cupboard
and
put
a
match
to
the
under
the
kettle
let
me
see
the
bedroom
up
here
is
it
said
pointing
along
a
passage
that
was
like
a
tunnel
concepcion
yielding
to
his
curiosity
turned
on
lights
everywhere
and
preceded
him
the
passage
hung
with
massive
canvases
had
scarcely
more
than
width
enough
for
shoulders
the
tiny
bedroom
was
muslined
in
every
conceivable
manner
it
had
a
colossal
bed
surpassing
even
christine
a
muslined
maid
was
bending
over
some
boxes
on
the
floor
and
removing
garments
therefrom
concepcion
greeted
her
like
a
sister
do
let
me
disturb
you
emily
she
said
and
to
emily
was
poor
queenie
maid
and
she
has
come
to
me
for
a
little
while
amicably
nodded
tears
came
suddenly
into
the
maid
eyes
looked
away
and
saw
the
bathroom
which
also
well
muslined
was
completely
open
to
the
bedroom
whose
this
marvellous
home
he
added
when
they
had
gone
back
to
the
i
think
the
original
tenant
is
the
wife
of
somebody
who
interned
how
simple
the
explanation
is
said
but
i
should
never
have
guessed
it
they
started
the
tea
in
a
strange
silence
after
a
minute
or
two
said
i
must
stay
long
neither
must
i
concepcion
smiled
got
to
go
out
yes
there
was
another
silence
then
concepcion
said
i
going
to
sarah
churcher
and
as
i
know
she
has
her
pageant
committee
at
i
better
not
arrive
later
than
five
had
i
what
is
there
between
you
and
lady
churcher
well
i
going
to
offer
to
take
queen
place
on
the
organising
committee
con
he
exclaimed
impulsively
you
are
in
an
instant
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
airless
apartment
was
charged
with
a
fluid
that
no
physical
chemistry
could
have
traced
concepcion
said
mildly
i
am
i
owe
it
to
queen
memory
to
take
her
place
if
i
can
of
course
i
no
dancer
but
in
other
things
i
expect
i
can
make
myself
useful
replied
with
equal
mildness
you
are
going
to
mix
yourself
up
with
that
crowd
again
after
all
you
been
through
the
pageant
business
is
good
enough
for
you
con
and
you
know
it
you
know
it
odious
she
murmured
i
feel
it
my
duty
i
feel
i
owe
it
to
queen
it
a
sort
of
religion
with
me
i
expect
each
person
has
his
own
religion
and
i
doubt
if
one
more
dogmatic
than
another
he
was
grieved
he
had
a
sense
almost
of
outrage
he
hated
to
picture
concepcion
subduing
herself
to
the
horrible
environment
of
the
pageant
enterprise
but
he
said
nothing
more
the
silence
resumed
they
might
have
conversed
with
care
about
the
inquest
or
about
the
funeral
which
was
to
take
place
at
the
castle
in
cheshire
silence
however
suited
them
best
also
i
thought
you
needed
repose
said
when
concepcion
broke
the
melancholy
enchantment
by
rising
to
look
for
cigarettes
i
must
be
allowed
to
work
she
answered
after
a
pause
putting
a
cigarette
between
her
teeth
i
must
have
something
to
do
unless
of
course
you
want
me
to
go
to
the
bad
altogether
it
was
a
remarkable
saying
but
it
seemed
to
admit
that
he
was
legitimately
entitled
to
his
critical
interest
in
her
if
i
known
that
he
said
suddenly
inspired
i
should
have
asked
you
to
take
on
something
for
he
waited
she
made
no
response
and
he
continued
i
secretary
of
my
small
affair
since
yesterday
the
paid
secretary
a
nice
enough
little
thing
has
just
run
off
to
the
women
auxiliary
corps
in
france
and
left
me
utterly
in
the
lurch
just
like
domestic
servants
these
earnest
are
when
it
comes
to
the
point
no
imagination
wanted
to
wear
khaki
and
no
doubt
thought
she
was
doing
a
splendid
thing
never
occurred
to
her
the
mess
i
should
be
in
i
have
asked
you
to
step
into
the
breach
you
have
been
frightfully
useful
but
i
no
concepcion
gently
and
carelessly
protested
well
she
was
either
i
should
have
wanted
you
to
be
a
typist
we
have
a
typist
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
job
needed
a
bit
more
brains
than
she
got
however
another
silence
rose
to
depart
concepcion
did
not
stir
she
said
softly
i
do
think
anybody
realises
what
queen
death
is
to
me
not
even
you
on
her
face
was
the
look
of
sacrifice
which
had
seen
there
as
they
talked
together
in
queen
boudoir
during
the
raid
he
thought
amazed
and
they
only
had
about
hours
together
and
part
of
that
must
have
been
spent
in
making
up
their
quarrel
then
aloud
i
quite
agree
people
ca
realise
what
they
have
had
to
go
through
i
understood
that
ever
since
i
read
in
the
paper
the
day
before
yesterday
that
bombs
fell
close
together
and
one
immediately
after
the
other
in
a
certain
quarter
of
the
west
end
that
was
all
the
paper
said
about
those
two
bombs
why
what
do
you
mean
and
i
understood
it
when
poor
old
queen
gave
me
some
similar
information
on
the
roof
what
you
mean
i
was
between
those
two
bombs
when
they
fell
one
of
blew
me
against
a
house
i
been
to
look
at
the
place
since
and
i
dashed
if
i
myself
could
realise
then
what
i
been
through
she
gave
a
little
cry
her
face
pleased
him
and
you
were
hurt
i
had
a
pain
in
my
side
but
it
gone
he
said
laconically
and
you
never
said
anything
to
us
why
not
well
there
were
so
many
other
things
you
astounding
no
i
not
i
just
myself
and
has
it
upset
your
nerves
not
as
far
as
i
can
judge
of
course
one
never
knows
but
i
think
not
what
do
you
think
she
offered
no
response
at
length
she
spoke
with
queer
emotion
you
remember
that
night
i
said
it
was
a
message
direct
from
potsdam
well
naturally
it
was
but
do
you
know
the
thought
that
tortures
me
supposing
the
shrapnel
that
killed
queen
was
out
of
a
shell
made
at
my
place
in
glasgow
it
might
have
been
supposing
it
was
con
he
said
firmly
i
simply
wo
listen
to
that
kind
of
talk
there
no
excuse
for
it
shall
i
tell
you
what
more
than
anything
else
has
made
me
respect
you
since
queen
was
killed
women
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
managed
to
remind
me
quite
illogically
and
quite
inexcusably
that
i
was
saying
hard
things
about
poor
old
queen
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
lying
dead
on
the
roof
you
did
you
knew
i
was
very
sorry
about
queen
but
you
knew
that
my
feelings
as
to
her
death
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
what
i
happened
to
be
saying
when
she
was
killed
you
knew
the
difference
between
sentiment
and
sentimentality
for
god
sake
do
start
wondering
where
the
shell
was
made
she
looked
up
at
him
saying
nothing
and
he
savoured
the
intelligence
of
her
weary
fine
alert
comprehending
face
he
did
not
pretend
to
himself
to
be
able
to
fathom
the
enigmas
of
that
long
glance
he
had
again
the
feeling
of
the
splendour
of
what
it
was
to
be
alive
to
have
survived
just
as
he
was
leaving
she
said
casually
very
well
i
do
what
you
want
what
i
want
i
wo
go
to
sarah
churcher
you
mean
you
come
as
assistant
secretary
she
nodded
only
i
do
need
to
be
paid
and
he
too
fell
into
a
casual
tone
that
excellent
thus
by
this
nonchalance
they
conspired
to
hide
from
themselves
the
seriousness
of
that
which
had
passed
between
them
the
grotesque
pretentious
little
apartment
was
mysteriously
humanised
it
was
no
longer
the
of
a
furnished
flat
by
chance
hired
for
a
month
they
had
lived
in
it
she
finished
eagerly
smiling
i
can
practise
my
religion
just
as
much
with
you
as
with
sarah
churcher
ca
i
queen
was
on
your
committee
too
yes
i
sha
be
deserting
her
the
remark
disquieted
his
triumph
that
aspect
of
the
matter
had
not
occurred
to
him
chapter
collapse
late
of
that
same
afternoon
in
the
absence
of
the
chairman
presided
as
honorary
secretary
over
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
lechford
hospitals
in
the
course
of
the
war
the
committee
had
changed
its
habitation
more
than
once
the
hotel
which
had
at
first
given
it
a
home
had
long
ago
been
commandeered
by
the
government
for
a
new
government
department
and
its
hundreds
of
chambers
were
now
full
of
the
clicking
of
typewriters
and
the
dictation
of
officially
phrased
correspondence
and
the
conferences
which
precede
decisions
and
the
untamed
footsteps
of
and
the
making
of
tea
and
chatter
about
cinemas
blouses
and
headaches
afterwards
the
committee
had
been
the
guest
of
a
bank
and
of
a
trust
company
and
had
for
a
period
even
paid
rent
to
a
common
landlord
but
its
object
was
always
to
escape
the
formality
of
and
it
was
now
lodged
in
an
untenanted
mansion
belonging
to
a
viscount
in
a
great
belgravian
square
its
sign
was
spread
high
across
the
facade
its
posters
were
in
the
windows
and
on
the
door
was
a
notice
such
as
in
nobody
had
ever
expected
to
see
in
that
quadrangle
of
guarded
sacred
castles
turn
the
handle
and
walk
in
the
mansion
though
much
later
in
date
was
built
precisely
on
the
lines
of
a
typical
bloomsbury
it
had
the
same
basement
the
same
general
disposition
of
rooms
the
same
abundance
of
stairs
and
paucity
of
baths
the
same
chilly
draughts
and
primeval
devices
for
heating
and
the
same
superb
disregard
for
the
convenience
of
servants
the
patrons
of
domestic
architecture
had
permitted
architects
to
learn
nothing
in
seventy
years
except
that
must
be
constructed
so
that
they
could
be
cleaned
without
exposing
sooty
infants
to
the
danger
of
suffocation
or
incineration
the
committee
sat
on
the
first
floor
in
the
back
whose
furniture
consisted
of
a
deal
table
windsor
chairs
a
row
of
a
wooden
box
containing
coal
half
a
poker
two
unshaded
lights
the
walls
from
which
all
the
paper
had
been
torn
off
were
decorated
with
lists
of
posters
and
rows
of
figures
scrawled
here
and
there
in
pencil
the
room
was
divided
from
the
main
by
the
usual
the
smaller
apartment
had
been
chosen
in
the
winter
because
it
was
somewhat
easier
to
keep
warm
than
the
other
one
in
the
main
the
honorary
secretary
camped
himself
at
a
desk
near
the
fireplace
when
the
clock
struck
one
of
whose
monastic
weaknesses
was
a
ritualistic
regard
for
punctuality
was
in
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
the
table
well
filled
with
members
for
the
honorary
secretary
harmless
foible
was
known
and
admitted
the
table
and
the
chairs
the
scraping
of
the
on
the
bare
floor
the
agenda
papers
and
the
ornamentation
thereof
by
pens
were
the
same
as
in
the
committee
youth
but
the
personnel
of
the
committee
had
greatly
changed
and
it
was
enlarged
as
its
scope
had
been
enlarged
the
two
lechford
hospitals
behind
the
french
lines
were
now
only
a
part
of
the
committee
responsibilities
it
had
a
special
hospital
in
paris
two
convalescent
homes
in
england
and
an
important
medical
unit
somewhere
in
italy
finance
was
becoming
its
chief
anxiety
for
the
reason
that
though
soldiers
had
not
abandoned
in
disgust
the
practice
of
being
wounded
philanthropists
were
unquestionably
showing
signs
of
fatigue
it
had
collected
money
by
postal
appeals
by
advertisements
by
selling
flags
by
competing
with
drapers
shops
by
intimidation
by
ruse
and
guile
and
by
all
the
other
recognised
methods
of
late
it
had
depended
largely
upon
the
very
wealthy
and
to
a
less
extent
upon
who
having
gradually
constituted
the
committee
his
hobby
had
contributed
some
thousands
of
pounds
from
his
share
of
the
magic
profits
of
the
reveille
company
everybody
was
aware
of
the
immense
importance
of
help
never
showed
it
in
his
demeanour
but
the
others
continually
showed
it
in
theirs
he
had
acquired
authority
he
had
also
acquired
the
sure
manner
of
one
accustomed
to
preside
before
we
begin
on
the
agenda
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
a
late
member
crept
apologetically
in
and
tiptoed
to
the
heavily
charged
i
would
like
to
mention
about
miss
trewas
some
of
you
know
that
through
an
admirable
but
somewhat
disordered
sense
of
patriotism
she
has
left
us
at
a
moment
notice
i
am
glad
to
say
that
my
friend
carlos
smith
who
i
may
tell
you
has
had
a
very
considerable
experience
of
organisation
has
very
kindly
agreed
subject
of
course
to
the
approval
of
the
committee
to
step
temporarily
into
the
breach
she
will
be
an
honorary
worker
like
all
of
us
here
and
i
am
sure
that
the
committee
will
feel
as
grateful
to
her
as
i
do
as
there
had
been
smiles
at
the
turn
of
his
phrase
about
miss
trewas
so
now
there
were
fervent
almost
emotional
smith
will
you
please
read
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
concepcion
was
sitting
at
his
left
hand
he
kept
thinking
i
one
of
those
who
get
things
done
two
hours
ago
and
the
idea
of
enlisting
her
had
not
even
occurred
to
him
and
already
he
had
taken
her
out
of
her
burrow
brought
her
to
the
offices
coached
her
in
the
preliminaries
of
her
allotted
task
and
introduced
several
important
members
of
the
committee
to
her
it
was
an
achievement
never
had
the
minutes
been
listened
to
with
such
attention
as
they
obtained
that
day
concepcion
was
apparently
not
in
the
least
nervous
and
she
read
very
well
far
better
than
the
deserter
miss
trewas
who
could
not
open
her
mouth
without
bridling
concepcion
held
the
room
those
who
had
not
seen
before
the
celebrated
concepcion
iquist
now
saw
her
and
sated
their
eyes
upon
her
she
had
been
less
a
woman
than
a
legend
the
romance
of
south
america
enveloped
her
and
the
romance
of
her
famous
and
notorious
uncle
of
her
triumph
over
the
west
end
her
startling
marriage
and
swift
widowing
her
journey
to
america
and
her
complete
disappearance
her
attachment
to
lady
queenie
and
now
her
dramatic
reappearance
and
the
sharp
condiment
to
all
this
was
the
general
knowledge
of
the
bachelor
long
intimacy
with
her
and
of
their
having
both
been
at
lechford
house
on
the
night
of
the
raid
and
both
been
at
the
inquest
on
the
body
of
lady
queenie
paulle
on
that
very
day
but
nobody
could
have
guessed
from
their
placid
and
demeanour
that
either
of
them
had
just
emerged
from
a
series
of
ordeals
they
won
a
deep
and
full
respect
still
some
people
ventured
to
have
their
own
ideas
and
an
ingenuous
few
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
legend
was
only
a
woman
after
all
and
a
rather
worn
woman
not
indeed
very
recognisable
from
her
innumerable
portraits
nevertheless
the
respect
for
the
pair
was
even
increased
when
broached
the
first
item
on
the
agenda
a
resolution
of
respectful
sympathy
with
the
marquis
and
marchioness
of
lechford
in
their
bereavement
of
profound
appreciation
of
the
services
of
lady
queenie
on
the
committee
and
of
an
intention
to
send
by
the
chairman
to
the
funeral
a
wreath
to
be
subscribed
for
by
the
members
proposed
the
resolution
himself
and
it
was
seconded
by
a
lady
and
supported
by
a
gentleman
whose
speeches
gave
no
hint
that
lady
queenie
had
again
and
again
by
her
caprices
nearly
driven
the
entire
committee
into
a
lunatic
asylum
and
had
caused
several
individual
resignations
put
the
resolution
without
a
tremor
it
was
impressively
carried
and
concepcion
wrote
down
the
terms
of
it
quite
calmly
in
her
secretarial
notes
the
performance
of
the
pair
was
marvellous
and
worthy
of
the
english
race
then
arrived
sir
stephen
bradern
sir
stephen
was
chairman
of
the
french
hospitals
management
said
sir
stephen
you
are
just
too
late
for
the
resolution
as
to
lady
queenie
paulle
i
deeply
apologise
chairman
replied
the
aged
but
active
sir
stephen
nervously
stroking
his
rather
long
beard
i
hope
however
that
i
may
be
allowed
to
associate
myself
very
closely
with
the
resolution
after
a
suitable
pause
and
general
silence
he
went
on
i
been
detained
by
that
nurse
smaith
that
my
been
having
trouble
with
you
find
when
you
come
to
them
that
she
on
my
minutes
i
just
had
an
interview
with
her
and
she
says
she
wants
to
see
the
executive
i
do
know
what
you
think
chairman
he
stopped
smiled
i
should
have
her
brought
in
said
the
lady
who
had
previously
spoken
if
i
might
suggest
she
added
a
boy
scout
who
seemed
to
have
long
ago
grown
out
of
his
uniform
entered
with
a
note
for
somebody
he
was
told
to
bring
in
nurse
smaith
she
proved
to
be
a
rather
short
and
rather
podgy
woman
with
a
reddish
not
rosy
complexion
and
red
hair
the
ugly
cape
of
the
british
red
cross
did
not
suit
her
better
than
it
suited
any
other
wearer
she
was
in
full
strict
starched
uniform
and
prominently
wore
medals
on
her
plenteous
breast
she
looked
as
though
if
she
had
a
sister
that
sister
might
be
employed
in
a
large
shop
at
brixton
or
islington
in
saying
gid
ahfternoon
she
revealed
the
purity
of
a
cockney
accent
undefiled
by
continental
experiences
she
sat
down
in
a
manner
sternly
defensive
she
was
nervous
and
abashed
but
evidently
dangerous
she
belonged
to
the
type
which
is
courageous
in
spite
of
fear
she
had
resolved
to
interview
the
committee
and
though
the
ordeal
frightened
her
she
desperately
and
triumphantly
welcomed
it
now
nurse
smaith
said
diplomatically
we
are
always
very
glad
to
see
our
nurses
even
when
our
time
is
limited
will
you
kindly
tell
the
committee
as
briefly
as
possible
just
what
your
claim
is
and
the
nurse
replied
with
medals
shaking
i
claiming
as
i
said
before
two
weeks
salary
in
loo
of
notice
and
my
fare
home
from
france
francs
salary
and
francs
expenses
and
i
sy
nothing
of
excess
luggage
but
you
did
home
i
have
come
home
though
one
of
those
members
whose
destiny
it
is
always
to
put
a
committee
in
the
wrong
remarked
but
surely
nurse
you
left
our
employ
nearly
a
year
ago
why
you
claim
before
i
been
at
you
for
two
months
at
least
and
i
was
ill
for
six
months
in
turin
they
had
to
put
me
off
the
train
there
said
nurse
smaith
getting
as
i
understand
said
you
left
us
in
order
to
join
a
serbian
unit
of
another
society
and
you
only
returned
to
england
in
february
i
did
leave
you
sir
that
is
i
mean
i
left
you
but
i
was
told
to
go
who
told
you
to
go
matron
sir
stephen
benevolently
put
in
but
the
matron
had
always
informed
us
that
it
was
you
who
said
you
would
stay
another
minute
we
have
it
in
the
correspondence
that
what
says
but
i
say
different
and
i
can
prove
it
said
there
must
be
some
misunderstanding
we
have
every
confidence
in
the
matron
and
she
still
with
us
then
i
sorry
for
you
he
turned
warily
to
another
aspect
of
the
subject
do
i
gather
that
you
went
straight
from
paris
to
serbia
yes
the
unit
was
passing
through
and
i
joined
it
but
how
did
you
obtain
your
passport
you
had
no
certificate
from
us
nurse
smaith
tossed
her
perilous
red
hair
oh
no
difficulty
about
that
i
am
not
friends
as
you
may
say
some
of
the
committee
looked
up
suspiciously
aware
that
the
matron
had
in
her
report
hinted
at
mysterious
relations
between
nurse
smaith
and
certain
authorities
the
doctor
in
charge
of
the
serbian
unit
was
only
too
glad
to
have
me
of
course
if
you
going
to
believe
everything
matron
says
her
tone
was
becoming
coarser
but
the
committee
could
neither
turn
her
out
nor
cure
her
natural
coarseness
nor
indicate
to
her
that
she
was
not
using
the
demeanour
of
she
was
firmly
lodged
among
them
and
she
went
from
bad
to
worse
of
course
if
you
going
to
swallow
everything
matron
says
it
is
as
if
i
was
the
only
one
may
i
ask
if
you
are
at
present
employed
i
do
see
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
said
nurse
smaith
still
gaining
ground
certainly
not
nothing
nothing
at
all
i
was
only
hoping
that
these
visits
here
are
not
inconvenient
to
you
well
as
it
seems
so
important
i
sy
i
going
out
to
salonika
next
week
and
that
why
i
want
this
business
settled
she
stopped
and
as
the
committee
remained
diffidently
and
apprehensively
silent
she
went
on
it
is
as
if
i
was
the
only
one
why
when
we
were
in
the
retreat
of
the
serbian
army
owver
the
mahntains
i
came
across
by
chance
if
you
call
it
chance
another
nurse
that
knew
all
about
been
under
her
in
bristol
for
a
year
a
young
member
pricking
up
asked
were
you
in
the
serbian
retreat
nurse
if
i
had
been
i
should
be
here
now
said
nurse
smaith
entirely
recovered
from
her
and
entirely
pleased
to
be
there
then
i
lost
all
i
had
at
ypek
all
i
took
was
my
medals
and
them
i
did
take
there
were
fifty
of
us
british
french
and
russians
we
had
nearly
three
weeks
in
the
mahntains
we
slept
rough
all
together
in
one
room
when
there
was
a
room
and
when
there
was
we
slept
in
stables
we
had
nothing
but
black
bread
and
that
froze
in
the
haversacks
and
if
we
took
our
boots
off
we
had
to
thaw
them
the
next
morning
before
we
could
put
them
on
if
we
had
had
three
saucepans
we
should
have
died
when
we
went
dahn
the
hills
two
of
us
had
to
hold
every
horse
by
his
head
and
tail
to
keep
them
from
falling
however
nearly
all
the
horses
died
and
then
we
took
the
packs
off
them
and
tried
to
drag
the
packs
along
by
hand
but
we
soon
stopped
that
all
the
were
littered
with
dead
horses
and
oxen
and
when
we
came
up
with
the
serbian
army
we
saw
soldiers
just
drop
down
and
die
in
the
snow
i
read
in
the
paper
there
were
no
children
in
the
retreat
but
i
saw
lots
of
children
strapped
to
their
mother
backs
yes
and
they
fell
down
together
and
froze
to
death
then
we
got
to
scutari
and
glad
i
was
she
glanced
round
defiantly
but
not
otherwise
moved
at
the
committee
the
hitherto
invisible
gods
of
hospitals
and
medical
units
the
nipping
wind
of
reality
had
blown
into
the
back
the
committee
was
daunted
but
some
of
its
members
less
daunted
than
the
rest
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
wonder
why
it
seemed
strange
and
strangely
chilling
that
a
rather
coarse
stout
woman
with
a
cockney
accent
and
little
social
refinement
should
have
passed
through
and
emerged
so
successfully
from
the
unimaginable
retreat
if
nurse
smaith
had
been
beautiful
and
slim
and
of
elegant
manners
they
could
not
have
controlled
their
chivalrous
enthusiasm
very
interesting
said
someone
glancing
at
nurse
smaith
proceeded
you
sy
i
did
come
home
but
the
money
for
my
journey
was
due
to
me
that
what
i
sy
francs
for
two
weeks
wages
and
francs
journey
money
as
regards
the
journey
money
observed
sir
stephen
blandly
never
paid
so
much
if
my
recollection
serves
me
and
of
course
we
have
to
remember
that
we
dealing
with
public
funds
nurse
smaith
sprang
up
looking
fixedly
at
concepcion
concepcion
had
thrown
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
her
face
was
so
drawn
that
it
was
no
more
the
same
face
even
if
it
is
public
funds
concepcion
shrieked
ca
you
give
francs
in
memory
of
those
three
saucepans
then
she
relapsed
on
to
the
table
her
head
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
violently
very
violently
the
sobs
rose
and
fell
in
the
scale
and
the
whole
body
quaked
jumped
to
his
feet
half
the
shocked
and
alarmed
committee
was
on
its
feet
nurse
smaith
had
run
round
to
concepcion
and
had
seized
her
with
a
persuasive
soothing
gesture
concepcion
quite
submissively
allowed
herself
to
be
led
out
of
the
room
by
nurse
smaith
and
sir
stephen
her
sobs
weakened
and
when
the
door
was
closed
could
no
longer
be
heard
a
lady
member
had
followed
the
three
the
committee
was
positively
staggered
by
the
unprecedented
affair
very
pale
said
smith
is
in
competent
hands
we
ca
do
anything
i
think
we
had
better
sit
down
he
was
obeyed
a
second
doctor
on
the
committee
remarked
with
a
curious
slight
smile
i
said
to
myself
when
i
first
saw
her
this
afternoon
that
smith
had
some
of
the
symptoms
of
a
nervous
breakdown
yes
concurred
i
very
much
regret
that
i
allowed
smith
to
come
but
she
was
determined
to
work
and
she
seemed
perfectly
calm
and
collected
i
very
much
regret
it
then
to
hide
his
constraint
he
pulled
towards
him
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
concepcion
had
been
making
notes
and
remembering
that
a
list
of
members
present
had
always
to
be
kept
he
began
to
write
down
names
he
was
extremely
angry
with
himself
he
had
tried
concepcion
too
high
he
ought
to
have
known
that
all
women
were
the
same
he
had
behaved
like
an
impulsive
fool
he
had
been
ridiculous
before
the
committee
what
should
have
been
a
triumph
was
a
disaster
the
committee
would
bind
their
two
names
together
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meeting
news
of
the
affairs
would
radiate
from
the
offices
in
every
direction
throughout
london
and
he
had
been
unfair
to
concepcion
their
relations
would
be
endlessly
complicated
by
the
episode
he
foresaw
trying
scenes
in
which
she
would
make
all
the
excuses
between
her
and
himself
perhaps
it
would
be
simpler
if
we
decided
to
admit
nurse
claim
said
a
timid
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
murmured
coldly
gazing
at
the
agenda
paper
and
yet
dominating
his
committee
the
question
will
come
up
on
the
minutes
of
the
hospitals
management
we
had
better
deal
with
it
then
the
next
business
on
the
agenda
is
the
letter
from
the
paris
service
de
santé
he
was
thinking
how
is
she
now
ought
i
to
go
out
and
see
and
the
majority
of
the
committee
was
vaguely
thinking
not
without
a
certain
pleasurable
malice
these
society
women
they
all
queer
chapter
the
invisible
powers
several
times
already
the
rumour
had
spread
in
the
promenade
that
the
promenade
would
be
closed
on
a
certain
date
and
the
promenade
had
not
been
closed
but
it
was
stated
that
the
promenade
would
be
closed
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
everybody
concerned
knew
that
the
prophecy
would
come
true
no
official
notice
was
issued
no
person
who
repeated
the
tale
could
give
a
reliable
authority
for
it
nevertheless
for
some
mysterious
reason
it
convinced
the
rival
promenade
had
already
passed
away
the
high
invisible
powers
who
ruled
the
world
of
pleasure
were
moving
at
the
behest
of
powers
still
higher
than
themselves
and
the
attendants
in
their
frivolous
tiny
aprons
shared
murmuringly
behind
plush
portières
in
the
woe
of
the
ladies
with
large
hats
the
revue
being
a
failure
the
auditorium
was
more
than
half
empty
in
the
promenade
to
each
man
there
were
at
least
five
pretty
ladies
and
the
ladies
looked
gloomily
across
many
rows
of
vacant
seats
at
the
bright
proscenium
where
jocularities
of
an
exacerbating
tedium
were
being
enacted
not
that
the
jocularities
were
inane
beyond
the
usual
but
failure
made
them
seem
so
none
had
the
slightest
idea
why
the
revue
had
failed
for
precisely
similar
revues
concocted
according
to
the
same
recipe
and
full
of
the
same
jocularities
executed
by
the
same
players
at
the
same
salaries
had
crowded
the
theatre
for
many
months
together
it
was
an
incomprehensible
universe
christine
suddenly
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
walked
out
what
use
in
staying
to
the
end
it
was
long
after
ten
and
an
exquisite
faint
light
lingering
in
the
sky
still
revealed
the
features
of
the
people
in
the
streets
the
man
who
had
devoted
half
a
life
to
the
ingenious
project
of
lengthening
the
summer
days
by
altering
clocks
was
in
his
disappointed
grave
but
victory
had
come
to
him
there
for
statesmen
had
at
last
proved
the
possibility
of
that
which
they
had
always
maintained
to
be
impossible
and
the
wisdom
of
that
which
they
had
always
maintained
to
be
idiotic
the
voluptuous
divine
melancholy
of
evening
june
descended
upon
the
city
from
the
sky
and
even
sounds
were
beautifully
sad
the
happy
progress
of
the
war
could
not
exorcise
this
soft
omnipotent
melancholy
yet
the
progress
of
the
war
was
nearly
all
that
could
be
desired
verdun
was
held
and
if
fort
vaux
had
been
lost
there
had
been
compensation
in
the
fact
that
the
enemy
through
the
gesture
of
the
crown
prince
in
allowing
the
captured
commander
of
the
fort
to
retain
his
sword
had
done
something
to
rehabilitate
themselves
in
the
esteem
of
mankind
lord
kitchener
was
drowned
but
the
discovery
had
been
announced
that
he
was
not
indispensable
indeed
there
were
those
who
said
that
it
was
better
thus
the
easter
rebellion
was
well
in
hand
order
was
understood
to
reign
in
an
ireland
hidden
behind
the
black
veil
of
the
censorship
the
mighty
naval
battle
of
jutland
had
quickly
transformed
itself
from
a
defeat
into
a
brilliant
triumph
the
disturbing
prices
of
food
were
about
to
be
reduced
by
means
of
a
committee
in
america
the
republican
forces
were
preparing
to
eject
president
wilson
in
favour
of
another
hughes
who
could
be
counted
upon
to
realise
the
of
the
united
states
an
economic
conference
was
assembling
in
paris
with
the
object
of
cutting
germany
off
from
the
rest
of
the
human
race
after
the
war
and
in
eleven
days
the
russians
had
made
prisoners
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
austrians
and
brusiloff
had
just
said
this
is
only
the
beginning
lastly
the
close
prospect
of
the
resistless
allied
western
offensive
which
would
deracinate
prussian
militarism
was
uplifting
men
minds
christine
walked
nonchalantly
and
uninvitingly
through
the
streets
quite
unresponsive
to
the
exhilaration
of
events
marthe
she
called
when
she
had
let
herself
into
the
flat
contrary
to
orders
the
little
hall
was
in
darkness
there
was
no
answer
she
lit
the
hall
and
passed
into
the
kitchen
lighting
it
also
there
in
the
terrible
and
incurable
squalor
of
marthe
own
kitchen
apron
was
thrown
untidily
across
the
back
of
the
solitary
windsor
chair
she
knew
then
that
marthe
had
gone
out
and
in
truth
although
very
annoyed
she
was
not
altogether
surprised
marthe
had
a
mysterious
love
affair
it
was
astonishing
in
view
of
the
intensely
aphrodisiacal
atmosphere
in
which
she
lived
that
marthe
did
not
continually
have
love
affairs
but
the
day
of
love
had
seemed
for
marthe
to
be
over
and
christine
found
great
difficulty
in
getting
her
ever
to
leave
the
flat
save
on
necessary
household
errands
on
the
other
hand
it
was
astonishing
that
any
man
should
be
attracted
by
the
fat
slattern
the
moth
now
fluttering
round
her
was
an
italian
waiter
as
to
whom
christine
had
learnt
that
he
was
being
unjustly
hunted
by
the
italian
military
authorities
hence
the
mystery
necessarily
attaching
to
the
love
affair
being
french
christine
despised
him
he
called
marthe
by
her
right
name
of
marta
and
christine
had
more
than
once
heard
the
pair
gabbling
in
the
kitchen
in
italian
just
as
though
she
had
been
a
conventional
christine
now
accused
marthe
of
ingratitude
because
the
woman
was
subordinating
christine
convenience
to
the
supreme
exigencies
of
fate
a
man
freedom
might
be
in
the
balance
marthe
future
might
be
in
the
balance
but
supposing
that
christine
had
come
home
with
a
gallant
and
no
de
to
do
service
she
walked
about
the
flat
shut
the
windows
drew
the
blinds
removed
her
hat
removed
her
gloves
stretched
them
put
her
things
away
she
gazed
at
the
two
principal
rooms
at
the
soiled
numbers
of
vie
and
the
cracked
in
the
at
the
rent
in
the
lace
bedcover
and
the
foul
mess
of
toilet
apparatus
in
the
bedroom
the
forlorn
emptiness
of
the
place
appalled
her
she
had
been
quite
fairly
successful
in
her
london
career
hundreds
of
men
had
caressed
her
and
paid
her
with
compliments
and
sweets
and
money
she
had
been
really
admired
the
flat
had
had
gay
hours
unmistakable
aristocrats
had
yielded
to
her
and
she
had
escaped
the
five
scourges
of
her
profession
it
was
all
over
the
chapter
was
closed
she
saw
nothing
in
front
of
her
but
decline
and
ruin
she
had
escaped
the
five
scourges
of
her
profession
but
part
of
the
price
of
this
immunity
was
that
through
keeping
herself
to
herself
she
had
not
a
friend
despite
her
profession
and
because
of
the
prudence
with
which
she
exercised
it
she
was
a
solitary
a
recluse
yes
of
course
she
had
gilbert
she
could
count
upon
gilbert
to
a
certain
extent
to
a
considerable
extent
but
he
would
not
be
eternal
and
his
fancy
for
her
would
not
be
eternal
once
before
easter
she
had
had
the
idea
that
he
meant
to
suggest
to
her
an
exclusive
liaison
foolish
nothing
less
than
nothing
had
come
of
it
he
would
not
be
such
an
imbecile
as
to
suggest
such
a
thing
to
her
miracles
did
not
happen
at
any
rate
not
that
kind
of
miracle
in
the
midst
of
her
desolation
an
old
persistent
dream
revisited
her
the
dream
of
a
small
country
cottage
in
france
with
a
dog
a
faithful
servant
respectability
good
name
works
of
charity
her
own
in
the
village
church
she
moved
to
the
wardrobe
and
unlocked
one
of
the
drawers
beneath
the
wide
doors
and
rummaging
under
the
linen
and
under
the
photographs
under
the
linen
she
drew
forth
a
package
and
spread
its
contents
on
the
table
in
the
her
securities
her
bonds
of
the
city
of
paris
ever
increasing
gilbert
had
tried
to
induce
her
to
accept
more
attractive
investments
but
she
would
not
never
these
were
her
consols
part
of
her
religion
bonds
of
the
city
of
paris
had
fallen
in
value
but
not
in
her
dogmatic
esteem
the
passionate
little
miser
that
was
in
her
surveyed
them
with
pleasure
even
with
assurance
but
they
were
still
far
too
few
to
stand
for
the
realisation
of
her
dream
and
she
might
have
to
sell
some
of
them
soon
in
order
to
live
she
replaced
them
carefully
in
the
drawer
with
dejection
unabated
when
she
glanced
at
the
table
again
she
saw
an
envelope
inexplicably
she
had
not
noticed
it
before
she
seized
it
in
hope
and
recognised
in
the
address
the
curious
hand
of
her
landlord
it
contained
a
notice
to
quit
the
tenancy
of
the
flat
was
weekly
this
was
the
last
blow
all
the
invisible
powers
of
london
were
conspiring
together
to
shatter
the
profession
what
in
the
name
of
the
holy
virgin
had
come
over
the
astounding
incomprehensible
city
then
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
marthe
no
marthe
would
never
ring
she
had
a
key
and
she
would
creep
in
a
lover
a
rich
spendthrift
kind
lover
hope
flickered
anew
in
her
desolated
heart
it
was
the
other
pretty
lady
a
newcomer
who
lived
in
the
house
a
rather
stylish
woman
of
about
unusually
fair
with
regular
features
and
a
very
dignified
carriage
indeed
not
unimposing
they
had
met
once
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
christine
was
not
sure
of
her
name
she
proclaimed
herself
to
be
russian
but
christine
doubted
the
assertion
her
french
had
no
trace
of
a
foreign
accent
and
in
view
of
the
of
the
russian
army
ladies
were
finding
it
advantageous
to
be
of
russian
blood
still
she
had
a
fine
cosmopolitan
air
to
which
christine
could
not
pretend
they
engaged
each
other
in
glances
i
hope
i
do
not
disturb
you
madame
not
at
all
madame
i
am
obliged
to
open
the
door
myself
because
my
servant
is
out
i
thought
i
heard
you
come
in
and
so
no
interrupted
christine
determined
not
to
admit
the
defeat
of
having
returned
from
the
promenade
alone
i
have
not
been
out
probably
it
was
my
servant
you
heard
ah
without
doubt
will
you
give
yourself
the
trouble
to
enter
madame
ah
exclaimed
the
russian
in
the
you
will
excuse
me
madame
but
what
a
beautiful
photograph
you
are
too
amiable
madame
a
friend
had
it
done
for
me
they
sat
down
you
are
deliciously
installed
here
said
the
russian
perfunctorily
looking
round
now
madame
i
have
been
here
only
three
weeks
and
i
receive
a
notice
to
quit
shall
i
be
indiscreet
if
i
ask
if
you
have
received
a
similar
notice
this
very
evening
said
christine
in
secret
still
more
disconcerted
by
this
further
proof
of
a
general
plot
against
human
nature
she
was
about
to
add
i
found
it
here
on
my
return
home
but
remembering
her
fib
managed
to
stop
in
time
well
madame
i
know
little
of
london
without
doubt
you
know
london
to
the
bottom
is
it
serious
this
notice
i
think
so
quite
serious
christine
said
you
see
there
is
a
crisis
it
is
the
war
that
in
london
has
led
to
the
discovery
that
men
have
desires
of
course
it
will
pass
but
oh
of
course
but
it
is
grotesque
this
crisis
it
is
perfectly
grotesque
christine
agreed
you
do
not
by
hazard
know
where
one
can
find
flats
to
let
i
hear
speak
of
bloomsbury
and
of
long
acre
but
it
seems
to
me
that
those
quarters
i
am
in
london
since
now
more
than
eighteen
months
said
christine
and
as
for
all
those
things
i
know
little
i
have
lived
here
in
this
flat
all
the
time
and
i
go
out
so
rarely
the
russian
put
in
with
eagerness
oh
i
also
i
go
out
so
to
speak
not
at
all
i
thought
i
had
seen
you
once
in
the
promenade
at
the
yes
it
is
true
interrupted
the
russian
quickly
i
went
from
curiosity
for
distraction
you
see
since
the
war
i
have
lived
in
dublin
i
had
there
a
friend
very
highly
placed
in
the
administration
he
married
one
lived
terrible
hours
during
the
revolt
i
decided
to
come
to
london
especially
as
however
i
do
not
wish
to
fatigue
you
with
all
that
christine
said
nothing
the
irish
rebellion
did
not
interest
her
she
was
in
no
mood
for
talking
about
the
irish
rebellion
she
had
convinced
herself
that
all
sinn
feiners
were
in
german
pay
and
naught
else
mattered
never
she
thought
had
the
british
government
carried
ingenuousness
further
than
in
this
affair
given
a
free
hand
christine
with
her
strong
direct
common
sense
would
have
settled
the
irish
question
in
hours
the
russian
after
a
little
pause
continued
i
merely
wished
to
ask
you
whether
the
notice
to
quit
was
serious
not
a
trick
for
raising
the
rent
christine
shook
her
head
to
the
last
clause
and
then
if
the
notice
was
quite
serious
whether
you
knew
of
any
flats
not
too
dear
not
that
i
mind
a
good
rent
if
one
receives
the
value
of
it
and
is
left
tranquil
the
conversation
might
at
this
point
have
taken
a
more
useful
turn
if
christine
had
not
felt
bound
to
hold
herself
up
against
the
high
tone
of
indifference
to
expenditure
the
russian
in
demanding
tranquillity
had
admitted
that
she
regularly
practised
the
profession
or
as
english
girls
strangely
called
it
the
business
and
christine
could
have
followed
her
lead
into
the
region
of
gossiping
and
intimate
realism
where
detailed
confidences
are
enlighteningly
exchanged
but
the
tone
about
money
was
a
challenge
i
should
have
been
enchanted
to
be
of
service
to
you
said
christine
but
i
know
nothing
i
go
out
less
and
less
as
for
this
notice
i
smile
at
it
i
have
a
friend
upon
whom
i
can
count
for
everything
i
have
only
to
tell
him
and
he
will
put
me
among
my
own
furniture
at
once
he
has
indeed
already
suggested
it
so
that
i
also
said
the
russian
my
new
friend
he
is
a
colonel
sent
from
dublin
to
london
has
insisted
upon
putting
me
among
my
own
furniture
but
i
have
refused
so
far
because
one
likes
to
know
more
of
a
gentleman
does
not
one
before
truly
murmured
christine
and
there
is
always
paris
said
the
russian
but
i
thought
you
were
from
petrograd
yes
but
i
know
paris
well
ah
there
is
only
paris
paris
is
a
second
home
to
me
can
one
get
a
passport
easily
for
paris
i
mean
supposing
the
grew
too
dangerous
again
why
not
madame
if
one
has
one
papers
to
get
a
passport
from
paris
to
london
that
would
be
another
thing
i
admit
i
see
that
you
play
the
russian
added
rising
with
a
gesture
towards
the
piano
i
have
heard
you
play
you
play
with
true
taste
i
know
for
when
a
girl
i
played
much
you
flatter
me
not
at
all
i
think
your
friend
plays
too
ah
said
christine
he
it
is
an
artist
that
one
they
turned
over
the
music
exchanged
views
about
waltzes
became
enthusiastic
laughed
and
parted
amid
manifestations
of
good
breeding
and
goodwill
as
soon
as
christine
was
alone
she
sat
down
and
wept
she
could
not
longer
contain
her
distress
paris
gleamed
before
her
but
no
it
was
a
false
gleam
she
could
not
make
a
new
start
in
paris
during
the
war
the
adventure
would
be
too
perilous
the
adventure
might
end
in
a
licensed
house
and
yet
in
london
what
was
there
in
london
but
ultimately
the
pavement
and
the
pavement
meant
complications
with
the
police
with
prowlers
with
other
women
it
meant
all
the
scourges
of
the
profession
including
probably
alcoholism
it
meant
prostitution
to
which
she
had
never
sunk
she
wished
she
had
been
killed
outright
in
the
she
had
an
idea
of
going
to
the
oratory
the
next
morning
and
perhaps
choosing
a
new
virgin
and
soliciting
favour
of
the
image
thereof
she
sobbed
and
sobbing
suddenly
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
telephone
and
even
as
she
gave
gilbert
number
she
broke
it
in
the
middle
with
a
sob
after
all
there
was
gilbert
chapter
the
victory
get
back
into
bed
said
having
silently
opened
the
window
in
the
he
spoke
with
courteous
persuasion
but
his
peculiar
intense
politeness
and
restraint
somewhat
dismayed
christine
by
experience
she
knew
that
they
were
a
sure
symptom
of
annoyance
she
often
though
not
on
this
occasion
wished
that
he
would
yield
to
anger
and
make
a
scene
but
he
never
did
and
she
would
hate
him
for
not
doing
so
the
fact
was
that
under
the
agreement
which
ruled
their
relations
she
had
no
right
to
telephone
to
him
save
in
grave
and
instant
emergency
and
even
then
it
was
her
duty
to
say
first
when
she
got
the
communication
pringle
wants
to
speak
to
mr
hoape
she
had
omitted
in
her
disquiet
to
fulfil
this
formality
recognising
his
voice
she
had
begun
passionately
without
preliminary
oh
beloved
thou
canst
not
imagine
what
has
happened
to
me
etc
still
he
had
come
he
had
cut
her
short
but
he
had
left
whatever
he
was
doing
and
had
amazingly
walked
over
at
once
and
in
the
meantime
she
had
hurriedly
undressed
and
put
on
a
new
peignoir
and
slipped
into
bed
of
course
she
had
had
to
open
the
door
herself
she
obeyed
his
command
like
an
intelligent
little
mouse
and
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
might
inspire
foreboding
alarm
even
terror
but
he
was
in
the
flat
he
was
the
saviour
man
in
the
flat
and
his
coming
was
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
he
might
have
been
out
he
might
have
been
entertaining
he
might
have
been
engaged
he
might
well
have
said
that
he
could
not
come
until
the
next
day
never
before
had
she
made
such
a
request
and
he
had
acceded
to
it
immediately
her
mood
was
one
of
frightened
triumph
he
was
being
most
damnably
himself
his
demeanour
was
as
faultless
as
his
dress
she
could
not
even
complain
that
he
had
forgotten
to
kiss
her
he
said
nothing
about
her
transgression
of
the
rule
as
to
telephoning
he
was
waiting
with
his
exasperating
sense
of
justice
and
until
she
had
acquainted
him
with
her
case
instead
of
referring
coldly
and
disapprovingly
to
the
matter
of
the
telephone
he
said
in
a
judicious
amicable
voice
i
doubt
whether
your
coiffeur
is
all
that
he
ought
to
be
i
see
you
had
your
hair
waved
yes
why
you
should
tell
the
fellow
to
give
you
the
new
method
of
steaming
with
electric
heaters
or
else
go
where
you
can
get
it
new
method
repeated
christine
the
tory
doubtfully
and
then
with
sudden
sexual
suspicion
who
told
you
about
it
oh
i
heard
of
it
months
ago
he
said
carelessly
besides
it
in
the
papers
in
the
advertisements
it
lasts
longer
much
longer
and
it
more
artistic
she
felt
sure
that
he
had
been
discussing
with
some
woman
she
thought
of
all
her
grievances
against
him
the
lechford
house
episode
rankled
in
her
mind
he
had
given
her
the
details
but
she
said
to
herself
that
he
had
given
her
the
details
only
because
he
had
foreseen
that
she
would
hear
about
the
case
from
others
or
read
about
it
in
the
newspapers
she
had
not
been
able
to
stomach
that
he
should
be
at
lechford
house
alone
late
at
night
with
two
women
of
the
class
she
hated
and
feared
and
the
very
night
of
her
dreadful
experience
with
him
in
the
no
explanations
could
make
that
seem
proper
or
fair
naturally
she
had
never
disclosed
her
feelings
further
the
frequenting
of
such
a
house
as
lechford
house
was
more
proof
of
his
social
importance
and
incidentally
of
his
riches
the
spectacle
of
his
flat
showed
her
long
ago
that
previously
she
had
been
underestimating
his
situation
in
the
world
the
revelations
as
to
lechford
house
had
seemed
to
show
her
that
she
was
still
underestimating
it
she
resented
his
modesty
she
was
inclined
to
attribute
his
modesty
to
a
desire
to
pay
her
as
little
as
he
reasonably
could
however
she
could
not
in
sincerity
do
so
he
treated
her
handsomely
considering
her
pretensions
but
considering
his
position
he
had
no
pretensions
not
handsomely
she
had
had
an
irrational
idea
that
having
permitted
her
to
see
the
splendour
of
his
flat
he
ought
to
have
increased
her
emoluments
that
indeed
she
should
be
paid
not
according
to
her
original
environment
but
according
to
his
she
also
resented
that
he
had
never
again
asked
her
to
his
flat
her
behaviour
on
that
sole
visit
had
apparently
decided
him
not
to
invite
her
any
more
she
resented
his
perfectly
hidden
resentment
what
disturbed
her
more
than
anything
else
was
a
notion
in
her
mind
possibly
a
wrong
notion
that
she
cared
for
him
less
madly
than
of
old
she
had
always
said
to
herself
and
more
than
once
sadly
to
him
that
his
fancy
for
her
would
not
and
could
not
last
but
that
hers
for
him
should
decline
puzzled
her
and
added
to
her
grievances
against
him
she
looked
at
him
from
the
little
nest
made
by
her
head
between
two
pillows
did
she
in
truth
care
for
him
less
madly
than
of
old
she
wondered
she
had
only
one
gauge
the
physical
she
began
to
talk
despairingly
about
marthe
whom
of
course
she
had
had
to
mention
at
the
door
he
said
quietly
but
it
not
because
of
marthe
caprices
that
i
asked
to
come
down
i
suppose
she
told
him
about
the
closing
of
the
promenade
in
a
tone
of
absolute
resigned
certainty
that
admitted
of
no
facile
or
reassurances
and
then
glancing
sidelong
at
the
where
the
lamp
burned
she
extended
her
arm
and
picked
up
the
landlord
notice
and
gave
it
to
him
to
read
watching
him
read
it
she
inwardly
trembled
as
though
she
had
started
on
some
perilous
enterprise
the
end
of
which
might
be
black
desperation
as
though
she
had
cast
off
from
the
shore
and
was
afloat
amid
the
waves
of
a
vast
swollen
river
waves
that
often
hid
the
distant
further
bank
she
felt
somehow
that
she
was
playing
for
all
or
nothing
and
though
she
had
had
immense
experience
of
men
though
it
was
her
special
business
to
handle
men
she
felt
herself
to
be
unskilled
and
incompetent
the
common
ruses
feints
devices
guiles
chicaneries
were
familiar
to
her
she
could
employ
them
as
well
as
any
and
better
than
most
they
succeeded
marvellously
and
absurdly
in
the
common
embarrassments
and
emergencies
because
they
had
not
to
stand
the
test
of
time
their
purpose
was
temporary
and
when
the
purpose
had
been
accomplished
it
did
not
matter
whether
they
were
unmasked
or
not
for
the
who
in
any
event
was
better
treated
than
he
deserved
either
had
gone
for
ever
or
would
soon
forget
or
was
too
proud
to
murmur
or
philosophically
accepted
a
certain
amount
of
wile
as
part
of
the
price
of
ecstasy
but
this
embarrassment
and
this
emergency
were
not
common
they
were
a
supreme
crisis
the
other
lady
has
had
notice
too
she
said
and
went
on
it
the
same
everywhere
in
this
quarter
i
know
not
if
it
is
the
same
in
other
districts
but
quite
probably
it
is
it
is
the
end
she
saw
by
the
lifting
of
his
eyebrows
that
he
was
impressed
that
he
secretly
admitted
the
justifiability
of
her
summons
to
him
and
instantly
she
took
a
reasonable
wise
calm
tone
it
is
a
little
serious
is
it
not
i
do
not
frighten
myself
but
it
is
serious
above
all
i
do
not
wish
to
trouble
thee
i
know
all
thy
anxieties
and
i
am
a
woman
who
understands
but
except
thee
i
have
not
a
friend
as
i
have
often
told
thee
in
my
heart
there
is
a
place
only
for
one
i
have
a
horror
of
all
those
women
they
weary
me
i
am
not
like
them
as
thou
well
knowest
thus
my
existence
is
solitary
i
have
no
relations
not
one
see
go
into
no
matter
what
interior
and
there
are
photographs
but
here
not
one
yes
one
my
own
i
am
forced
to
regard
my
own
portrait
what
would
i
not
give
to
be
able
to
put
on
my
thy
portrait
but
i
can
not
do
not
deceive
thyself
i
am
not
complaining
i
comprehend
perfectly
it
is
impossible
that
a
woman
like
me
should
have
thy
photograph
on
her
she
smiled
smoothing
for
a
moment
the
pucker
out
of
her
brow
and
lately
i
see
thee
so
little
thou
comest
less
frequently
and
when
thou
comest
well
one
embraces
a
little
music
and
then
thou
art
gone
is
it
not
so
he
said
but
thou
knowest
the
reason
i
am
terribly
busy
i
have
all
the
preoccupations
in
the
world
my
committee
it
is
not
all
smooth
my
committee
everything
and
everybody
depends
on
me
and
in
the
committee
i
have
enemies
too
the
fact
is
i
have
become
a
beast
of
burden
i
dream
about
it
and
there
are
others
in
worse
case
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
third
year
of
the
war
we
must
not
forget
that
my
little
rabbit
she
replied
very
calmly
and
reasonably
and
caressingly
do
not
imagine
to
thyself
that
i
blame
thee
i
do
not
blame
thee
i
comprehend
too
well
all
that
thou
dost
all
that
thou
art
worth
in
every
way
thou
art
stronger
than
me
i
am
ten
times
nothing
i
know
it
i
have
no
grievance
against
thee
thou
hast
always
given
me
what
thou
couldst
and
i
on
my
part
have
never
demanded
too
much
say
have
i
been
excessive
at
this
hour
i
make
no
claim
on
thee
i
have
done
all
that
to
me
was
possible
to
make
thee
happy
in
my
soul
i
have
always
been
faithful
to
thee
i
do
not
praise
myself
for
that
i
did
not
choose
it
these
things
are
not
chosen
they
come
to
pass
that
is
all
and
it
arrived
that
i
was
bound
to
go
mad
about
thee
and
to
remain
so
what
wouldst
thou
speak
not
of
the
war
is
it
not
because
of
the
war
that
i
am
in
exile
and
that
i
am
ruined
i
have
always
worked
honestly
for
my
living
and
there
is
not
on
earth
an
officer
who
has
encountered
me
who
can
say
that
i
have
not
been
particularly
nice
to
him
because
he
was
an
officer
thou
wilt
excuse
me
if
i
speak
of
such
matters
i
know
i
am
wrong
it
is
contrary
to
my
habit
but
what
wouldst
thou
i
also
have
done
what
i
could
for
the
war
but
it
is
my
ruin
oh
my
gilbert
tell
me
what
i
must
do
i
ask
nothing
from
thee
but
advice
it
was
for
that
that
i
dared
to
telephone
thee
answered
casually
i
see
nothing
to
worry
about
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
another
flat
that
is
all
but
i
i
know
nothing
of
london
one
tells
me
that
it
is
in
future
impossible
for
women
who
live
alone
like
me
to
find
a
flat
that
is
to
say
respectable
absurd
i
will
find
a
flat
i
know
precisely
where
there
is
a
flat
but
will
they
let
it
to
me
they
will
let
it
to
i
suppose
said
he
still
casually
a
pause
ensued
she
said
in
a
voice
trembling
thou
art
not
going
to
say
to
me
that
thou
wilt
put
me
among
my
own
furniture
the
flat
is
furnished
but
it
is
the
same
thing
do
not
let
such
a
hope
shine
before
me
me
who
saw
before
me
only
the
pavement
thou
art
not
serious
i
never
was
more
serious
for
whom
dost
thou
take
me
one
she
cried
oh
you
english
you
are
you
make
love
as
you
go
to
war
like
one
word
it
is
decided
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
ah
you
english
she
had
almost
screamed
shuddering
under
the
shock
of
his
decision
for
which
she
had
impossibly
hoped
but
whose
reality
overwhelmed
her
he
sat
there
in
front
of
her
elegant
impeccably
dressed
distinguished
aristocratic
rich
in
the
full
wisdom
of
his
years
and
in
the
strength
of
his
dominating
will
and
in
the
righteousness
of
his
heart
one
could
absolutely
trust
such
as
him
to
do
the
right
thing
and
to
do
it
generously
and
to
do
it
all
the
time
and
she
had
won
him
he
had
recognised
her
qualities
she
had
denied
any
claim
upon
him
but
by
his
decision
he
had
admitted
a
claim
a
claim
that
no
money
could
satisfy
after
all
for
eighteen
months
she
had
been
more
to
him
than
any
other
woman
he
had
talked
freely
to
her
he
had
concealed
naught
from
her
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
his
discouragements
and
his
weaknesses
he
had
had
no
shame
before
her
by
her
acquiescences
her
skill
her
warmth
her
adaptability
her
intense
womanliness
she
had
created
between
them
a
bond
stronger
than
anything
that
could
keep
them
apart
the
bond
existed
it
could
not
during
the
whole
future
be
broken
save
by
a
disloyalty
a
disloyalty
she
divined
would
irrevocably
destroy
it
but
she
had
no
fear
on
that
score
for
she
knew
her
own
nature
his
decision
did
more
than
fill
her
with
a
dizzy
sense
of
relief
a
mad
intolerable
happiness
it
her
no
ordinary
woman
handicapped
as
she
was
could
have
captured
this
fastidious
and
shy
paragon
and
the
notion
that
her
passion
for
him
had
dwindled
was
utterly
ridiculous
like
the
notion
that
he
would
tire
of
her
she
was
saved
she
burst
into
wild
tears
ah
pardon
me
she
sobbed
i
am
quite
calm
really
but
since
the
thou
knowest
i
have
not
been
quite
the
same
thou
thou
art
different
nothing
could
disturb
thy
calm
ah
if
thou
wert
a
general
at
the
front
what
what
presence
of
mind
but
i
he
bent
towards
her
and
she
suddenly
sprang
up
and
seized
him
round
the
neck
and
ate
his
lips
and
while
she
strangled
and
consumed
him
she
kept
muttering
to
him
hope
not
that
i
shall
thank
thee
i
can
not
i
can
not
the
words
with
which
i
could
thank
thee
do
not
exist
but
i
am
thine
thine
all
of
me
is
thine
humiliate
me
demand
of
me
impossible
things
i
am
thy
slave
thy
creature
ah
let
me
kiss
thy
beautiful
grey
hairs
i
love
thy
hair
and
thy
ears
the
thought
of
her
insatiable
temperament
flashed
through
her
as
she
held
him
and
of
his
northern
sobriety
and
of
the
profound
unchangeable
difference
between
these
two
she
would
discipline
her
temperament
she
would
subjugate
it
women
were
capable
of
miracles
and
women
alone
and
she
was
capable
of
miracles
a
strange
muffled
noise
came
to
them
across
the
darkness
of
the
and
raised
his
head
slightly
to
listen
repose
repose
thyself
in
the
arms
of
thy
little
mother
she
breathed
softly
it
is
nothing
it
is
but
the
wind
blowing
the
blind
against
the
curtains
and
later
when
she
had
distilled
the
magic
of
the
hour
and
was
tranquillised
she
said
and
where
is
it
this
flat
chapter
idyll
christine
said
to
marie
otherwise
la
mère
gaston
the
new
servant
in
the
new
flat
who
was
holding
in
her
hand
a
telegram
addressed
to
hoape
albany
give
it
to
me
i
will
put
it
in
front
of
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
she
lodged
it
among
the
gilt
cupids
that
supported
the
clock
on
the
fringed
mantelpiece
in
the
she
did
so
with
a
little
gesture
of
childlike
glee
expressing
her
satisfaction
in
the
flat
as
a
whole
the
flat
was
dark
she
did
not
object
loving
artificial
light
the
rooms
were
all
very
small
she
loved
cosiness
there
was
a
garage
close
by
which
might
have
disturbed
her
nights
but
it
did
not
the
bathroom
was
open
to
the
bedroom
no
arrangement
could
be
better
in
enumerating
the
disadvantages
of
the
flat
had
said
also
that
it
was
too
much
and
too
heavily
furnished
not
at
all
she
adored
the
cumbrous
and
rich
furniture
she
did
not
want
in
her
flat
the
empty
spaces
of
a
she
wanted
to
feel
that
she
was
within
an
interior
inside
something
she
gloried
in
the
flat
she
preferred
it
even
to
her
memory
of
flat
in
the
albany
its
golden
ornateness
flattered
her
the
glittering
cornices
and
the
big
carved
frames
of
the
pictures
of
impossible
flowers
and
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
historic
coiffures
and
costumes
appeared
marvellous
to
her
she
had
never
seen
and
certainly
had
never
hoped
to
inhabit
anything
like
it
but
then
gilbert
was
always
better
than
his
word
he
had
been
quite
frank
telling
her
that
he
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
flat
simply
because
it
had
been
occupied
for
a
brief
time
by
the
carlos
smith
of
whom
she
had
heard
and
read
and
who
had
had
to
leave
it
on
account
of
health
she
did
not
remind
him
that
once
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
when
she
had
noticed
the
name
and
portrait
of
carlos
smith
in
the
paper
he
sitting
by
her
side
had
concealed
from
her
that
he
knew
carlos
smith
judiciously
she
had
never
made
the
slightest
reference
to
that
episode
though
she
detested
the
unknown
carlos
smith
she
admired
and
envied
her
for
a
great
illustrious
personage
and
was
secretly
very
proud
of
succeeding
carlos
smith
in
the
tenancy
and
when
gilbert
told
her
that
he
had
had
his
eye
on
the
flat
for
her
before
carlos
smith
took
it
and
had
hesitated
on
account
of
its
drawbacks
she
was
even
more
proud
and
reassured
also
for
this
detail
was
a
proof
that
gilbert
had
really
had
the
intention
to
put
her
among
her
own
furniture
long
before
the
night
of
the
supreme
appeal
to
him
only
he
was
always
so
cautious
and
gilbert
was
the
discoverer
of
la
mère
gaston
too
and
as
frank
about
her
as
about
the
flat
la
mère
gaston
was
the
widow
of
a
french
soldier
domiciled
in
london
previous
to
the
war
who
had
died
of
wounds
in
one
of
the
lechford
hospitals
and
it
was
through
the
lechford
committee
that
gilbert
had
come
across
her
a
few
weeks
earlier
than
the
beginning
of
the
formal
liaison
braiding
had
fallen
ill
for
a
space
and
madame
gaston
had
been
summoned
as
charwoman
to
aid
braiding
young
sister
in
the
albany
flat
with
excellent
judgment
gilbert
had
chosen
her
to
succeed
marthe
whom
he
himself
had
reproachfully
dismissed
from
cork
street
he
was
amazingly
clever
was
gilbert
for
he
had
so
arranged
things
that
christine
had
been
able
to
cut
off
her
cork
street
career
as
with
a
knife
she
had
departed
from
cork
street
with
two
trunks
and
a
few
cardboard
boxes
her
stove
was
abandoned
to
the
landlord
and
vanished
into
london
and
left
no
trace
except
gilbert
nobody
who
knew
her
in
cork
street
was
aware
of
her
new
address
and
nobody
who
knew
her
in
mayfair
knew
that
she
had
come
from
cork
street
her
ancient
acquaintances
in
cork
street
would
ring
the
bell
there
in
vain
madame
gaston
was
a
neat
plump
woman
of
perhaps
forty
not
looking
her
years
she
had
a
comprehending
eye
after
three
words
from
gilbert
she
had
mastered
the
situation
and
as
she
perfectly
realised
where
her
interest
lay
she
could
be
relied
upon
for
discretion
in
all
delicate
matters
only
her
eye
talked
she
was
a
protestant
and
went
to
the
french
church
in
soho
square
which
she
called
the
temple
christine
and
she
had
had
but
one
sunday
together
and
christine
had
gone
with
her
to
the
temple
the
fact
was
that
christine
had
decided
to
be
a
protestant
she
needed
a
religion
and
catholicism
had
an
inconvenience
confession
she
had
regularised
her
position
so
much
so
that
by
comparison
with
the
past
she
was
now
perfectly
respectable
yet
if
she
had
been
candid
in
the
confessional
the
priest
would
still
have
convicted
her
of
mortal
sin
which
would
have
been
very
unfair
and
she
could
not
in
view
of
her
respectability
have
remained
a
catholic
without
confessing
however
infrequently
madame
gaston
as
soon
as
she
was
sure
of
her
convert
referred
to
catholicism
as
idolatry
put
your
apron
on
marie
said
christine
monsieur
will
be
here
directly
ah
yes
madame
have
you
opened
the
to
take
away
the
smell
of
cooking
yes
madame
am
i
all
right
marie
madame
gaston
surveyed
her
mistress
who
turned
round
yes
madame
i
think
that
monsieur
will
much
like
that
she
departed
to
don
the
apron
between
these
two
it
was
continually
monsieur
monsieur
he
was
seldom
there
but
he
was
always
there
always
being
consulted
placated
invoked
revered
propitiated
magnified
he
was
the
giver
of
all
good
and
there
was
no
other
allah
and
he
had
two
prophets
christine
sang
she
twittered
she
pirouetted
out
of
sheer
youthful
joy
she
had
forgotten
care
and
forgotten
promiscuity
good
fortune
had
washed
her
pure
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
massive
bevelled
mirror
and
saw
that
she
was
fresh
and
young
and
lithe
and
graceful
and
she
felt
triumphant
gilbert
had
expressed
the
fear
that
she
might
get
lonely
and
bored
he
had
even
said
that
occasionally
he
might
bring
along
a
man
and
that
perhaps
the
man
would
have
a
very
nice
woman
friend
she
had
not
very
heartily
responded
she
was
markedly
sympathetic
towards
englishmen
but
towards
english
women
no
and
especially
she
did
not
want
to
know
any
english
women
in
the
same
situation
as
herself
lonely
impossible
bored
impossible
she
had
an
establishment
she
had
a
civil
list
her
days
passed
like
an
arabian
dream
she
never
had
an
unfilled
moment
and
when
each
day
was
over
she
always
remembered
little
things
which
she
had
meant
to
do
and
had
not
found
time
to
do
she
was
a
superb
sleeper
and
arose
at
noon
three
usually
struck
before
her
day
had
fairly
begun
unless
of
course
she
happened
to
be
very
busy
in
which
case
she
would
be
ready
for
contact
with
the
world
at
the
her
main
occupation
was
to
charm
allure
and
gratify
a
man
for
that
she
lived
her
distractions
were
music
the
reading
of
novels
and
grandes
and
for
the
war
she
knitted
in
her
new
situation
it
was
essential
that
she
should
do
something
for
the
war
therefore
she
knitted
being
a
good
knitter
and
her
knitting
generally
lay
about
she
popped
into
the
to
see
if
the
table
was
well
set
for
dinner
it
was
but
in
order
to
show
that
marie
did
not
know
everything
she
rearranged
somewhat
the
flowers
in
the
central
bowl
then
she
returned
to
the
and
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
waited
the
instant
of
arrival
approached
gilbert
punctuality
was
absolute
always
had
been
sometimes
it
alarmed
her
she
could
not
have
to
wait
more
than
a
minute
or
two
according
to
the
inexactitude
of
her
clock
the
bell
rang
and
simultaneously
she
began
to
play
a
exercise
often
in
the
old
life
she
had
executed
upon
him
this
innocent
subterfuge
to
make
him
think
she
practised
the
piano
to
a
greater
extent
than
she
actually
did
that
indeed
she
was
always
practising
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
was
not
deceived
hear
marie
fly
to
the
front
door
see
christine
face
see
her
body
as
in
her
pale
bright
gown
she
peeps
round
the
door
of
the
she
lives
then
her
eyes
sparkle
for
the
giver
of
all
good
for
the
adored
and
her
brow
is
puckered
for
him
and
the
jewels
on
her
hand
burn
for
him
and
every
pleat
of
her
garments
visible
and
invisible
is
pleated
for
him
she
is
a
child
she
has
snatched
up
a
chocolate
and
put
it
between
her
teeth
and
so
she
offers
the
half
of
it
to
him
smiling
silent
she
is
a
child
but
she
is
also
a
woman
intensely
skilled
in
her
art
monster
she
said
come
this
way
and
she
led
him
down
the
tunnel
to
the
bedroom
there
in
a
corner
of
the
bathroom
stood
an
antique
closed
such
as
was
used
by
men
in
the
days
before
splashing
and
sousing
were
invented
she
had
removed
it
from
the
open
it
she
commanded
he
obeyed
its
little
compartments
which
had
been
empty
were
filled
with
a
man
toilet
instruments
brushes
file
scissors
his
own
brand
a
the
set
was
complete
she
had
known
exactly
the
requirements
it
is
a
little
present
from
thy
woman
she
said
in
future
thou
wilt
have
no
excuse
sit
down
marie
madame
take
off
the
boots
of
monsieur
marie
knelt
christine
found
the
new
slippers
and
now
this
she
said
after
he
had
washed
and
used
the
new
brushes
producing
a
black
with
velvet
collar
and
cuffs
how
tired
thou
must
be
after
thy
day
she
murmured
patting
him
with
tiny
pats
thou
knowest
my
little
one
she
said
pointing
to
the
in
the
bedroom
fireplace
for
the
other
rooms
a
i
am
indifferent
but
the
bedroom
is
something
else
the
bedroom
is
sacred
i
could
not
tolerate
a
in
the
bedroom
a
coal
fire
is
necessary
to
me
you
do
not
think
so
yes
he
said
you
are
quite
right
it
shall
be
seen
to
can
i
give
the
order
thou
permittest
me
to
give
the
order
certainly
in
the
she
cushioned
him
well
in
the
best
and
sitting
down
on
a
pouf
near
him
began
to
knit
like
an
industrious
wife
who
understands
the
seriousness
of
war
nothing
escaped
the
attention
of
that
man
he
espied
the
telegram
what
that
ah
she
cried
springing
up
and
giving
it
to
him
stupid
that
i
am
i
forgot
he
looked
at
the
address
how
did
this
come
here
he
asked
mildly
marie
brought
it
from
the
albany
oh
he
opened
the
telegram
and
read
it
having
dropped
the
envelope
into
the
gilded
basket
by
the
fender
it
is
nothing
serious
she
questioned
no
business
he
might
have
shown
it
to
her
he
had
shown
her
telegrams
before
but
he
stuck
it
into
his
pocket
then
without
a
word
to
christine
he
rang
the
bell
and
marie
appeared
marie
the
telegram
why
did
you
bring
it
here
monsieur
it
was
like
this
i
went
to
monsieur
flat
to
fetch
two
aprons
that
i
had
left
there
the
telegram
was
on
the
console
in
the
knowing
that
monsieur
was
to
come
direct
here
i
brought
it
does
braiding
know
you
brought
it
ah
as
for
braiding
monsieur
marie
stopped
disclaiming
any
responsibility
for
braiding
of
whom
she
was
somewhat
jealous
i
thought
to
do
well
i
am
sure
of
it
but
surely
you
can
see
you
have
been
indiscreet
do
do
it
again
no
monsieur
i
ask
pardon
of
monsieur
immediately
afterwards
he
said
to
christine
in
a
gay
careless
tone
and
this
here
is
it
all
right
have
we
tried
it
let
us
try
it
the
weather
is
warm
dearest
but
just
to
try
it
i
always
like
to
satisfy
myself
in
time
fusser
she
exclaimed
and
ignited
the
stove
he
gazed
at
it
absently
then
picked
up
a
cigarette
and
taking
the
telegram
from
his
pocket
folded
it
into
a
spill
and
with
it
lit
the
cigarette
yes
he
said
meditatively
it
seems
not
a
bad
stove
and
he
held
the
spill
till
it
had
burnt
to
his
then
he
extinguished
the
stove
she
said
to
herself
he
has
burned
the
telegram
on
purpose
but
how
cleverly
he
did
it
ah
that
man
there
is
none
but
him
she
was
disquieted
about
the
telegram
she
feared
it
her
superstitiousness
was
awakened
she
thought
of
her
apostasy
from
catholicism
to
protestantism
she
thought
of
a
holy
virgin
angered
and
throughout
the
evening
and
throughout
the
night
amid
her
smiles
and
teasings
and
coaxings
and
caresses
and
ecstasies
and
all
her
accomplished
voluptuous
girlishness
the
image
of
a
resentful
holy
virgin
flitted
before
her
why
should
he
burn
a
business
telegram
also
was
he
not
at
intervals
a
little
chapter
the
window
sat
on
the
seat
of
the
large
overhanging
open
below
him
was
the
river
tributary
of
the
severn
in
front
the
old
bridge
with
an
ancient
street
rising
beyond
and
above
that
the
silhouette
of
the
roofs
of
wrikton
surmounted
by
the
spire
of
its
vast
church
to
the
left
was
the
weir
and
the
cliffs
were
there
also
and
the
last
tints
of
the
sunset
somebody
came
into
the
looked
round
hoping
that
it
might
after
all
be
concepcion
but
it
was
concepcion
maid
emily
an
imitative
young
woman
who
seemed
to
have
caught
from
her
former
employer
the
quality
of
strange
sinister
provocativeness
she
paused
a
moment
before
speaking
her
thin
figure
was
somewhat
indistinct
in
the
twilight
smith
wishes
me
to
say
that
she
will
certainly
be
well
enough
to
take
you
to
the
station
in
the
morning
sir
said
she
in
her
specious
tones
but
she
hopes
you
will
be
able
to
stay
till
the
afternoon
train
i
sha
he
shook
his
head
very
well
sir
and
after
another
moment
pause
emily
apparently
with
a
challenging
reluctance
receded
through
the
shadows
of
the
room
and
vanished
was
extremely
depressed
and
somewhat
indignant
he
gazed
down
bitterly
at
the
water
following
with
his
eye
the
incredibly
long
branches
of
the
tree
that
from
the
height
of
the
buttresses
drooped
perpendicularly
into
the
water
he
had
had
an
astounding
and
for
having
responded
to
concepcion
telegram
for
having
taken
the
telegram
seriously
he
had
deserved
what
he
got
thus
he
argued
she
had
met
him
on
the
hot
saturday
afternoon
in
a
ford
car
she
did
not
look
she
looked
as
if
she
had
fairly
recovered
from
her
acute
neurasthenia
she
was
smartly
and
carelessly
dressed
in
a
summer
sporting
costume
and
had
made
a
strong
contrast
to
every
other
human
being
on
the
platform
of
the
small
provincial
station
the
car
drove
not
to
the
famous
principal
hotel
but
to
a
small
hotel
just
beyond
the
bridge
she
had
given
him
tea
in
the
and
taken
him
out
again
on
foot
showing
him
the
town
the
houses
the
immense
castle
the
the
spacious
residences
the
multiplicity
of
solicitors
banks
and
surveyors
the
bursting
provision
shops
with
imposing
fractions
of
animals
and
expensive
pies
and
the
drapers
with
ladies
blouses
at
then
she
had
conducted
him
to
an
organ
recital
in
the
vast
church
where
amid
faint
and
beadles
and
stalls
and
stained
glass
and
holiness
and
centuries
of
history
and
the
high
respectability
of
the
town
she
had
whispered
sibilantly
and
other
people
had
whispered
in
the
long
intervals
of
the
organ
she
had
removed
him
from
the
church
before
the
collection
for
the
red
cross
and
when
they
had
eaten
a
sort
of
dinner
she
had
borne
him
away
to
the
russian
dancers
in
the
moot
hall
she
said
she
had
seen
the
russian
dancers
once
already
and
that
they
were
richly
worth
to
him
a
train
journey
the
posters
of
the
russian
dancers
were
rather
daring
and
seductive
the
russian
dancers
themselves
were
the
most
desolating
stage
spectacle
that
had
ever
witnessed
the
troupe
consisted
of
intensely
english
girls
of
various
ages
and
the
costumes
had
obviously
been
fabricated
by
the
artistes
the
artistes
could
neither
dance
pose
group
make
an
entrance
make
an
exit
nor
even
smile
the
ballets
obviously
fabricated
by
the
same
persons
as
the
costumes
had
no
plot
no
beginning
and
no
end
crude
amateurishness
was
the
characteristic
of
these
honest
and
professionals
who
somehow
contrived
to
be
neither
men
nor
women
and
assuredly
not
epicene
but
who
travelled
from
country
town
to
country
town
in
a
glamour
of
posters
exciting
the
towns
in
spite
of
a
perfect
lack
of
sex
because
they
were
the
fabled
russian
dancers
the
moot
hall
was
crammed
with
adults
and
their
cackling
offspring
who
heartily
applauded
the
show
which
indeed
was
billed
as
a
return
visit
due
to
terrific
success
on
a
previous
occasion
is
it
not
too
marvellous
concepcion
had
said
he
had
admitted
that
it
was
but
the
boredom
had
been
excruciating
in
the
street
they
had
bought
an
evening
paper
of
which
he
had
never
before
heard
the
name
to
learn
news
of
the
war
the
war
however
seemed
very
far
off
it
had
grown
unreal
we
talk
concepcion
had
said
and
gone
abruptly
to
bed
still
he
had
slept
well
in
the
soft
climate
to
the
everlasting
murmur
of
the
weir
then
the
sunday
she
was
indisposed
could
not
come
down
to
breakfast
but
hoped
to
come
down
to
lunch
could
not
come
down
to
lunch
but
hoped
to
come
down
to
tea
could
not
come
down
to
tea
and
so
on
to
nightfall
the
sunday
had
been
like
a
thousand
years
to
him
he
had
learnt
the
town
and
the
suburbs
of
it
the
streets
the
main
thoroughfares
and
the
slums
by
the
afternoon
he
was
recognising
familiar
faces
in
the
town
he
had
twice
made
the
classic
round
along
the
cliffs
over
the
new
bridge
which
was
an
antique
up
the
hill
to
the
castle
through
the
down
the
high
street
to
the
old
bridge
he
had
explored
the
brain
of
the
landlord
who
could
not
grapple
with
a
and
who
spent
most
of
the
time
during
closed
hours
in
patiently
bolting
the
front
door
which
was
continually
opening
he
had
talked
to
the
old
customer
who
whenever
the
house
was
open
sat
at
a
table
in
the
garden
over
a
mug
of
cider
he
had
played
through
all
the
musical
comedies
dance
albums
and
pianoforte
albums
that
littered
the
piano
he
had
read
the
same
sunday
papers
that
he
read
in
the
albany
and
he
had
learnt
the
of
the
sole
servant
a
very
young
agreeable
woman
with
a
and
a
baby
which
baby
she
carried
about
with
her
when
serving
at
table
her
husband
was
in
france
she
said
that
as
soon
as
she
had
received
his
permission
to
do
so
she
should
leave
as
she
really
could
not
get
through
all
the
work
of
the
hotel
and
mind
and
feed
a
baby
she
said
also
that
she
played
the
piano
herself
and
she
regretted
that
baby
and
pressure
of
work
had
deprived
her
of
a
sight
of
the
russian
dancers
because
she
had
heard
so
much
about
them
and
was
sure
they
were
beautiful
this
detail
touched
heart
to
a
mysterious
and
sweet
and
almost
intolerable
melancholy
he
had
not
made
the
acquaintance
of
for
there
were
none
save
concepcion
and
emily
and
in
the
evening
as
in
the
morning
the
weir
placidly
murmured
and
the
river
slipped
smoothly
between
the
huge
jutting
buttresses
of
the
old
bridge
and
the
thought
of
the
perpetuity
of
the
river
in
whose
mirror
the
venerable
town
was
a
mushroom
obsessed
him
mastered
him
and
made
him
as
old
as
the
river
he
was
and
by
life
and
by
his
own
life
and
by
the
incomprehensible
and
angering
fantasy
of
concepcion
his
took
on
the
appearance
of
the
monstrous
then
the
door
opened
again
and
concepcion
entered
in
a
white
gown
the
antithesis
of
her
sporting
costume
of
the
day
before
she
approached
through
the
thickening
shadows
of
the
room
and
the
vague
whiteness
of
her
gown
reminded
him
of
the
whiteness
of
the
form
climbing
the
on
the
roof
of
lechford
house
in
the
raid
knowing
her
he
ought
to
have
known
that
having
made
him
believe
that
she
would
not
come
down
she
would
certainly
come
down
he
restrained
himself
showed
no
untoward
emotion
and
said
in
a
calm
genial
voice
oh
i
so
glad
you
were
well
enough
to
come
down
she
sat
opposite
to
him
in
the
rather
sideways
so
that
her
skirt
was
pulled
close
round
her
left
thigh
and
flowed
free
over
the
right
he
could
see
her
still
plainly
in
the
dusk
i
never
yet
apologised
to
you
for
my
style
of
behaviour
at
the
committee
of
yours
she
began
abruptly
in
a
soft
kind
reasonable
voice
i
know
i
let
you
down
horribly
yes
yes
i
did
and
i
ought
to
apologise
to
you
for
too
but
i
do
think
i
apologise
to
you
for
bringing
you
to
wrikton
and
this
place
they
not
real
you
know
they
an
illusion
there
is
no
such
place
as
wrikton
and
this
river
and
this
window
there
could
be
could
there
queen
and
i
motored
over
here
once
from
paulle
it
not
so
very
far
and
we
agreed
that
it
did
really
exist
i
never
forgot
it
i
was
determined
to
come
here
again
some
time
and
that
why
i
chose
this
very
spot
when
half
harley
street
stood
up
and
told
me
i
must
go
away
somewhere
after
my
cure
and
be
by
myself
far
from
the
pernicious
influence
of
friends
i
think
i
gave
you
a
very
fair
idea
of
the
town
yesterday
but
i
did
show
you
the
funniest
thing
in
it
the
inside
of
a
solicitor
office
you
remember
the
large
grey
stone
house
in
mill
street
the
grass
street
you
know
with
and
on
the
brass
plate
and
the
strip
of
green
felt
nailed
all
round
the
front
door
to
keep
the
wind
out
in
winter
well
it
all
in
the
same
key
inside
and
i
do
know
which
is
the
funniest
the
russian
dancers
or
the
green
felt
round
the
front
door
or
simpover
or
the
other
simpover
i
sure
neither
of
those
men
is
real
though
they
both
somehow
have
children
you
remember
the
yellow
cards
that
you
see
in
so
many
of
the
windows
man
has
gone
from
this
house
to
fight
for
king
and
country
the
elder
simpover
thinks
it
would
be
rather
boastful
to
put
the
card
in
the
window
so
he
keeps
it
on
the
mantelpiece
in
his
private
office
it
for
his
son
and
yet
i
assure
you
the
father
is
real
he
is
like
the
town
he
simply
could
be
real
what
have
been
up
to
in
the
private
office
asked
lightly
making
my
will
what
for
is
it
the
proper
thing
to
do
i
left
everything
to
you
you
have
con
he
protested
there
was
absolutely
no
tranquillity
about
this
woman
with
her
the
disconcerting
unexpected
happened
every
five
minutes
did
you
suppose
i
was
going
to
send
any
of
my
possessions
back
to
my
tropical
relatives
in
south
america
i
left
everything
to
you
to
do
what
you
like
with
squander
it
if
you
like
but
i
expect
you
give
it
to
war
charities
anyhow
i
thought
it
would
be
safest
in
your
hands
he
retorted
in
a
tone
quietly
and
sardonically
challenging
but
i
was
under
the
impression
you
were
cured
of
my
neurasthenia
yes
i
believe
i
am
i
gained
thirteen
pounds
in
the
nursing
home
and
slept
like
a
greengrocer
in
fact
the
treatment
with
modern
improvements
of
course
enjoyed
a
marvellous
triumph
in
my
case
but
that
not
the
point
i
know
you
think
i
behaved
very
childishly
yesterday
and
that
i
deserved
to
be
ill
for
what
i
did
yesterday
and
i
admit
you
a
saint
for
not
saying
so
but
i
was
really
childish
and
i
have
really
been
ill
only
been
in
a
devil
of
a
dilemma
i
wanted
to
tell
you
something
i
telegraphed
for
you
so
that
i
could
tell
you
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
was
afraid
to
tell
you
not
afraid
but
i
could
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
or
not
i
lain
in
bed
all
day
trying
to
decide
the
point
i
decided
i
ought
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
just
now
i
became
an
automaton
and
put
on
some
things
and
here
i
am
telling
you
she
paused
kept
silence
then
she
continued
in
a
voice
in
which
persuasiveness
was
added
to
calm
engaging
reasonableness
now
you
must
get
rid
of
all
your
conventional
ideas
because
you
rather
conventional
you
must
be
completely
straight
i
mean
intellectually
otherwise
i
ca
treat
you
as
an
intellectual
equal
and
i
want
to
you
must
be
a
realist
if
any
man
can
be
she
spoke
almost
with
tenderness
he
felt
mysteriously
shy
and
with
a
brusque
movement
of
the
head
shifted
his
glance
from
her
to
the
river
well
he
questioned
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
water
that
continually
slipped
in
large
swirling
glinting
sheets
under
the
bridge
i
going
to
kill
myself
at
first
the
words
made
no
impression
on
him
he
replied
you
were
right
when
you
said
this
place
was
an
illusion
it
is
and
then
he
began
to
be
afraid
did
she
mean
it
she
was
capable
of
anything
and
he
was
involved
in
her
inescapably
yes
he
was
afraid
nevertheless
as
she
kept
silence
he
went
on
with
bravado
and
how
do
you
intend
to
do
it
that
will
be
my
affair
but
i
venture
to
say
that
my
way
of
doing
it
will
make
wrikton
historic
she
said
curiously
gentle
trust
you
he
exclaimed
suddenly
looking
at
her
con
why
you
always
be
so
theatrical
she
changed
her
posture
for
an
easier
one
half
reclining
her
face
and
demeanour
seemed
to
have
the
benign
masculinity
of
a
man
i
sorry
she
answered
i
ought
to
have
said
that
at
any
rate
to
you
i
ought
to
have
had
more
respect
for
your
feelings
he
said
you
are
cured
that
evident
all
this
is
physical
of
course
it
physical
she
agreed
with
an
intonation
of
astonishment
that
he
should
be
guilty
of
an
utterance
so
obvious
and
banal
did
you
ever
know
anything
that
was
did
you
ever
even
conceive
anything
that
was
if
you
can
show
me
how
to
conceive
spirit
except
in
terms
of
matter
i
like
to
listen
to
you
it
against
nature
to
kill
yourself
oh
she
murmured
i
quite
used
to
that
charge
you
are
by
any
means
the
first
to
accuse
me
of
being
against
nature
but
can
you
tell
me
where
nature
ends
that
another
thing
i
like
to
know
my
dear
friend
you
being
conventional
and
you
are
being
realistic
you
must
know
perfectly
well
in
your
heart
that
there
no
reason
why
i
should
kill
myself
if
i
want
to
you
are
going
to
talk
to
me
about
the
ten
commandments
i
suppose
are
you
a
risk
of
course
on
the
other
side
shore
but
perhaps
it
worth
taking
you
are
in
a
position
to
say
it
is
worth
taking
and
at
worst
the
other
shore
must
be
marvellous
it
may
possibly
be
terrible
if
you
arrive
too
soon
and
without
being
asked
but
it
must
be
marvellous
naturally
i
believe
in
immortality
if
i
did
the
thing
would
be
worth
doing
oh
i
should
hate
to
be
extinguished
but
to
change
one
existence
for
another
if
the
fancy
takes
you
that
seems
to
me
the
greatest
proof
of
real
independence
that
anybody
can
give
it
tremendous
you
playing
chess
with
fate
and
winning
and
you
knock
up
the
and
fate
has
to
begin
all
over
again
ca
you
see
how
tremendous
it
is
and
how
tempting
it
is
the
temptation
is
terrific
i
can
see
all
that
said
he
was
surprised
by
a
sudden
sense
of
esteem
for
the
mighty
volition
hidden
behind
those
calm
worn
gracious
features
but
concepcion
body
was
younger
than
her
face
he
perceived
as
it
were
for
the
first
time
that
concepcion
was
immeasurably
younger
than
himself
and
yet
she
had
passed
far
beyond
him
in
experience
but
what
the
origin
of
all
this
what
do
you
want
to
do
it
for
what
happened
then
you
believe
i
mean
to
do
it
yes
he
replied
sincerely
and
as
naturally
as
he
could
that
the
tone
i
like
to
hear
said
she
smiling
i
felt
sure
i
could
count
on
you
not
to
indulge
in
too
much
nonsense
well
going
to
try
the
next
avatar
just
to
remind
fate
of
my
existence
i
think
fate
forgotten
me
and
i
can
stand
anything
but
that
lost
carly
and
i
lost
queen
oh
is
it
awful
to
think
that
when
i
offered
you
queen
she
already
gone
and
it
was
only
her
dead
body
i
was
offering
you
and
i
lost
my
love
and
failed
and
i
shall
never
be
any
more
good
here
i
swore
i
would
see
a
certain
thing
through
and
i
have
seen
it
through
and
i
ca
but
i
told
you
all
this
before
what
left
even
my
unhappiness
is
leaving
me
unless
i
kill
myself
i
shall
cease
to
exist
do
you
understand
yes
you
do
after
a
marked
pause
she
added
and
i
may
overtake
queen
there
one
thing
i
do
understand
he
said
as
we
being
frank
with
each
other
why
do
you
tell
me
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
you
really
making
me
a
party
to
this
scheme
of
yours
he
spoke
with
a
perfectly
benevolent
detachment
deriving
from
hers
and
as
he
spoke
he
thought
of
a
man
whom
he
had
once
known
and
who
had
committed
suicide
and
of
all
that
he
had
read
about
suicides
and
what
he
had
thought
of
them
suicides
had
been
incomprehensible
to
him
and
either
despicable
or
pitiable
and
he
said
to
himself
here
is
one
of
them
or
is
it
an
illusion
but
she
has
made
all
my
notions
of
suicide
seem
ridiculous
she
answered
his
spoken
question
with
vivacity
why
do
i
tell
you
i
do
know
that
the
point
i
been
arguing
to
myself
all
night
and
all
day
not
telling
you
something
me
is
forcing
me
to
tell
you
perhaps
it
much
more
important
that
you
should
comprehend
me
than
that
you
should
be
spared
the
passing
worry
that
i
causing
you
by
showing
you
the
inside
of
my
head
you
the
only
friend
i
have
left
i
knew
you
before
i
knew
carly
i
practically
committed
suicide
from
my
particular
world
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
i
was
going
back
to
my
particular
world
you
remember
in
that
little
furnished
flat
i
was
going
back
to
it
but
you
would
let
me
it
was
you
who
definitely
cut
me
off
from
my
past
i
might
have
been
gadding
about
safely
with
sarah
churcher
and
her
lot
at
this
very
hour
but
you
would
have
it
otherwise
and
so
i
finished
up
with
neurasthenia
you
commanded
and
i
obeyed
well
he
said
ignoring
all
her
utterance
except
the
last
words
obey
me
again
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
she
demanded
wistfully
and
yet
defiantly
her
features
were
tending
to
disappear
in
the
tide
of
night
but
she
happened
to
sit
up
and
lean
forward
and
bring
them
a
little
closer
to
him
you
no
right
to
stop
me
from
doing
what
i
want
to
do
what
right
have
you
to
stop
me
besides
you
ca
stop
me
nothing
can
stop
me
it
is
settled
everything
is
arranged
he
too
sat
up
and
leaned
forward
in
a
voice
rendered
soft
by
the
realisation
of
the
fact
that
he
had
indeed
known
her
before
carlos
smith
knew
her
and
had
imagined
himself
once
to
be
in
love
with
her
and
of
the
harshness
of
her
destiny
and
the
fading
of
her
glory
he
said
simply
and
yet
in
spite
of
himself
insinuatingly
no
i
do
claim
any
right
to
stop
you
i
understand
better
perhaps
than
you
think
but
let
me
come
down
again
next
do
let
me
he
insisted
still
more
softly
even
while
he
was
speaking
he
expected
her
to
say
you
only
suggesting
that
in
order
to
gain
time
but
she
said
how
can
you
be
sure
it
would
be
my
inquest
and
funeral
i
should
be
you
come
down
to
he
replied
i
could
trust
you
a
delicate
charged
with
the
scent
of
some
plant
came
in
at
the
open
window
and
deranged
ever
so
slightly
a
glistening
lock
on
her
forehead
peering
at
her
saw
the
masculinity
melt
from
her
face
he
saw
the
mysterious
resurrection
of
the
girl
in
her
and
felt
in
himself
the
sudden
exciting
outflow
from
her
of
that
temperamental
fluid
whose
springs
had
been
dried
up
since
the
day
when
she
learnt
of
her
widowhood
she
flushed
he
looked
away
into
the
dark
water
as
though
he
had
profanely
witnessed
that
which
ought
not
to
be
witnessed
earlier
in
the
interview
she
had
inspired
him
with
shyness
he
was
now
stirred
agitated
thrilled
overwhelmed
by
the
effect
on
her
of
his
own
words
and
his
own
voice
he
was
afraid
of
his
power
as
a
prophet
might
be
afraid
of
his
power
he
had
worked
a
miracle
a
miracle
infinitely
more
convincing
than
anything
that
had
led
up
to
it
the
miracle
had
brought
back
the
reign
of
reality
very
well
she
quivered
and
there
was
a
movement
and
she
was
gone
he
glanced
quickly
behind
him
but
the
room
lay
black
a
transient
pallor
on
the
blackness
and
the
door
banged
he
sat
a
long
time
solemn
gazing
at
the
serrated
silhouette
of
the
town
against
a
sky
that
obstinately
held
the
wraith
of
daylight
and
listening
to
the
everlasting
murmur
of
the
invisible
weir
not
a
sound
came
from
the
town
not
the
least
sound
when
at
length
he
stumbled
out
he
saw
the
figure
of
the
landlord
smoking
the
pipe
of
philosophy
and
waiting
with
a
landlord
fatalism
for
the
last
guest
to
go
to
bed
and
they
talked
of
the
weather
chapter
the
envoy
the
next
night
having
been
hailed
by
an
acquaintance
was
talking
at
the
top
of
the
steps
beneath
the
portal
of
a
club
in
piccadilly
it
was
after
ten
by
the
clocks
and
nearly
but
not
quite
dark
a
warm
rather
heavy
evening
shower
had
ceased
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
great
macintosh
epoch
of
the
war
when
the
paucity
of
the
means
of
vehicular
locomotion
had
rendered
macintoshes
permissible
even
for
women
with
pretensions
to
smartness
and
at
intervals
stylish
girls
on
their
way
home
from
unaccustomed
overtime
passed
the
doors
in
transparent
macintoshes
of
pink
yellow
or
green
as
scornful
as
military
officers
of
the
effeminate
umbrella
whose
use
was
being
confined
to
clubmen
and
old
dowdies
the
acquaintance
sought
advice
from
about
the
shutting
up
of
households
for
belgian
refugees
answered
absently
not
concealing
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
had
in
fact
been
held
up
within
three
minutes
of
the
scene
of
his
secret
idyll
and
was
anxious
to
arrive
there
he
had
promised
himself
this
surprise
visit
to
christine
as
some
sort
of
recompense
and
narcotic
for
the
immense
disturbance
of
spirit
which
he
had
suffered
at
wrikton
that
morning
concepcion
had
been
invisible
but
at
his
early
breakfast
he
had
received
a
note
from
her
a
brief
but
masterly
composition
if
ever
so
slightly
theatrical
he
was
conscious
of
tenderness
for
concepcion
of
sympathy
with
her
of
a
desire
to
help
to
restore
her
to
that
which
by
misfortune
she
had
lost
but
the
first
of
these
sentiments
he
resolutely
put
aside
he
was
determined
to
change
his
mood
towards
her
for
the
sake
of
his
own
tranquillity
and
he
had
convinced
himself
that
his
wise
calm
common
sense
was
capable
of
saving
her
from
any
tragic
and
fatal
folly
he
had
her
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
but
if
she
was
expecting
too
much
from
him
she
would
be
gradually
disappointed
he
must
have
peace
he
could
not
allow
a
bomb
to
be
thrown
into
his
habits
he
was
a
bachelor
of
over
fifty
whose
habits
had
the
value
of
inestimable
jewels
and
whose
perfect
independence
was
the
most
precious
thing
in
the
world
at
his
age
he
could
not
marry
a
volcano
a
revolution
a
new
element
exhibiting
properties
which
were
an
enigma
to
social
science
concepcion
would
turn
his
existence
into
an
endless
drama
of
which
she
alone
with
her
devilish
talent
for
the
sensational
would
always
choose
the
setting
as
she
had
chosen
the
window
and
the
weir
no
he
must
not
mistake
affectionate
sympathy
for
tenderness
nor
tolerate
the
sexual
exploitation
of
his
pity
as
he
listened
and
talked
to
the
acquaintance
his
inner
mind
shifted
with
relief
to
the
vision
of
christine
contented
and
simple
and
compliant
in
her
nest
christine
at
once
restful
and
exciting
christine
the
exquisite
symbol
of
acquiescence
and
response
what
a
contrast
to
concepcion
it
had
been
a
bold
and
sudden
stroke
to
lift
christine
to
another
plane
but
a
stroke
well
justified
and
entirely
successful
fulfilling
his
dream
at
this
moment
he
noticed
a
figure
pass
the
doorway
in
whose
shadow
he
was
and
he
exclaimed
within
himself
incredulously
that
is
christine
in
the
shortest
possible
delay
he
said
to
his
acquaintance
and
jumped
down
the
steps
and
followed
eastwards
the
figure
he
followed
warily
for
already
the
strange
and
distressing
idea
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
must
not
overtake
her
if
she
it
was
it
was
she
he
caught
sight
of
her
again
in
the
thick
obscurity
by
the
of
devonshire
house
he
recognised
the
peculiar
brim
of
the
new
hat
and
the
new
military
umbrella
held
on
the
wrist
by
a
thong
what
was
she
doing
abroad
she
could
not
be
going
to
a
theatre
she
had
not
a
friend
in
london
he
was
her
london
and
la
mère
gaston
was
not
with
her
theoretically
of
course
she
was
free
he
had
laid
down
no
law
but
it
had
been
clearly
understood
between
them
that
she
should
never
emerge
at
night
alone
she
herself
had
promulgated
the
rule
for
she
had
a
sense
of
propriety
and
a
strong
sense
of
reality
she
had
belonged
to
the
class
which
respectable
broadminded
women
when
they
bantered
always
called
the
pretty
ladies
and
as
a
postulant
for
respectability
she
had
for
her
own
satisfaction
to
mind
her
p
and
q
she
could
not
afford
not
to
keep
herself
above
suspicion
she
had
been
a
courtesan
did
she
look
like
one
as
an
individual
figure
in
repose
no
none
could
have
said
that
she
did
he
had
long
since
learnt
that
to
decide
always
correctly
by
appearance
and
apart
from
environment
and
gesture
whether
an
unknown
woman
was
or
was
not
a
wanton
presented
a
task
beyond
the
powers
of
even
the
completest
experience
but
christine
was
walking
in
piccadilly
at
night
and
he
soon
perceived
that
she
was
discreetly
showing
the
demeanour
of
a
courtesan
at
her
profession
she
who
had
hated
and
feared
the
pavement
he
knew
too
well
the
signs
the
waverings
the
turns
of
the
head
the
variations
in
speed
the
scarcely
perceptible
hesitations
the
unmistakable
air
of
wandering
with
no
definite
objective
near
dover
street
he
hastened
through
the
thin
reflecting
mire
amid
beams
of
light
and
illuminated
numbers
that
advanced
upon
him
in
both
directions
thundering
or
purring
and
crossed
piccadilly
and
hurried
ahead
of
her
to
watch
her
in
safety
from
the
other
side
of
the
thoroughfare
he
could
hardly
see
her
she
was
only
a
moving
shadow
but
still
he
could
see
her
and
in
the
long
stretch
of
gloom
beneath
the
facade
of
the
royal
academy
he
saw
the
shadow
pause
in
front
of
a
military
figure
which
by
a
flank
movement
avoided
the
shadow
and
went
resolutely
forward
he
lost
her
in
front
of
the
piccadilly
hotel
and
found
her
again
at
the
corner
of
air
street
she
swerved
into
air
street
and
crossed
regent
street
he
was
following
in
denman
street
close
to
shaftesbury
avenue
she
stood
still
in
front
of
another
military
figure
a
common
soldier
as
it
proved
who
also
rebuffed
her
the
thing
was
flagrant
he
halted
and
deliberately
let
her
go
from
his
sight
she
vanished
into
the
dark
crowds
of
the
avenue
in
horrible
humiliation
in
atrocious
disgust
he
said
to
himself
never
will
i
set
eyes
on
her
again
never
never
why
was
she
doing
it
not
for
money
she
could
only
be
doing
it
from
the
nostalgia
of
adventurous
debauch
she
was
the
slave
of
her
temperament
as
the
drunkard
is
the
slave
of
his
thirst
he
had
told
her
that
he
would
be
out
of
town
for
the
week
end
on
committee
business
he
had
distinctly
told
her
that
she
must
on
no
account
expect
him
on
the
monday
night
and
her
temperament
had
roused
itself
from
the
obscene
groves
of
her
subconsciousness
like
a
tiger
and
come
up
and
driven
her
forth
how
easy
for
her
to
escape
from
la
mère
gaston
if
she
chose
and
yet
would
she
dare
even
at
the
bidding
of
the
tiger
to
introduce
a
stranger
into
the
flat
unnecessary
he
reflected
there
were
a
hundred
accommodating
dubious
interiors
between
shaftesbury
avenue
and
leicester
square
he
understood
he
neither
accused
nor
pardoned
but
he
was
utterly
revolted
and
wounded
not
merely
in
his
soul
but
in
the
most
sensitive
part
of
his
soul
his
pride
he
called
himself
by
the
worst
epithet
of
opprobrium
simpleton
the
bold
and
sudden
stroke
had
now
become
the
fatuous
caprice
of
a
damned
fool
had
he
at
his
age
been
capable
of
overlooking
the
elementary
axiom
once
a
wrong
always
a
wrong
had
he
believed
in
reclamation
he
laughed
out
his
disgust
no
he
did
not
blame
her
to
blame
her
would
have
been
ridiculous
she
was
only
what
she
was
and
not
worth
blame
she
was
nothing
at
all
how
right
how
cursedly
right
were
the
respectable
dames
in
the
accent
of
amused
indifference
which
they
employed
for
their
precious
phrase
the
pretty
ladies
well
he
would
treat
her
generously
but
through
his
lawyer
and
in
the
desolation
the
dismay
the
disillusion
the
nausea
which
ravaged
him
he
was
unwillingly
conscious
of
fragments
of
thoughts
that
flickered
like
transient
flames
far
below
in
the
deep
mines
of
his
being
you
are
an
astounding
woman
con
do
you
want
me
to
go
to
the
bad
altogether
in
offering
him
queen
had
not
concepcion
made
the
supreme
double
sacrifice
of
attempting
to
bring
together
at
the
price
of
her
own
separation
from
both
of
them
the
two
beings
to
whom
she
was
most
profoundly
attached
it
was
a
marvellous
deed
worry
volcanoes
revolutions
was
he
afraid
of
them
were
they
not
the
very
essence
of
life
a
figure
of
nobility
sitting
there
now
by
the
window
over
the
river
listening
to
the
weir
i
shall
never
be
any
more
good
but
she
never
had
a
gesture
that
was
not
superb
was
he
really
encrusted
in
habits
really
like
men
whom
he
knew
and
despised
at
his
club
she
loved
him
and
what
rich
flattering
love
was
her
love
compared
to
she
was
young
tenderness
such
were
the
flames
of
dim
promise
that
nickered
immeasurably
beneath
the
dark
devastation
of
his
mind
he
ignored
them
but
he
could
not
ignore
them
he
extinguished
them
but
they
were
continually
relighted
a
wedding
what
sort
of
a
wedding
poor
carlos
pathetically
buried
under
the
ruthless
happiness
of
others
what
a
shame
poor
carlos
nice
enough
little
cocotte
nothing
else
but
of
course
incurable
he
remembered
all
her
crimes
now
how
she
had
been
late
in
dressing
for
their
first
dinner
her
inexplicable
vanishing
from
the
never
explained
but
easily
explicable
now
perhaps
and
so
on
and
so
on
simpleton
ass
he
had
walked
heedless
of
direction
he
was
near
lechford
house
many
of
its
windows
were
lit
the
great
front
doors
were
open
a
commissionaire
stood
on
guard
in
front
of
them
to
the
railings
was
affixed
a
notice
no
person
will
be
allowed
to
enter
these
premises
without
a
pass
to
this
rule
there
is
no
exception
lechford
house
had
been
taken
over
in
its
entirety
by
a
government
department
that
believed
in
the
virtue
of
mystery
and
of
long
hours
he
looked
up
at
the
higher
windows
he
could
not
distinguish
the
chimney
amid
the
stars
he
thought
of
queen
the
white
woman
evidently
he
had
never
understood
queen
for
if
concepcion
admired
her
she
was
worth
admiration
concepcion
never
made
a
mistake
in
assessing
fundamental
character
the
complete
silent
absorption
of
lechford
house
into
the
rather
dismayed
him
he
had
seen
not
a
word
as
to
the
affair
in
the
newspapers
and
lechford
house
was
one
of
the
final
strongholds
of
privilege
he
strolled
on
into
the
quietness
of
the
park
of
which
one
of
the
said
to
him
that
it
would
be
shutting
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
solitude
and
surrounded
by
london
he
stood
still
and
the
vast
sea
of
war
seemed
to
be
closing
over
him
the
war
was
growing
or
the
sense
of
its
measureless
scope
was
growing
it
had
sprung
not
out
of
this
crime
or
that
but
out
of
the
secret
invisible
roots
of
humanity
and
it
was
widening
to
the
limits
of
evolution
itself
it
transcended
judgment
it
defied
conclusions
and
rendered
equally
impossible
both
hope
and
despair
his
pride
in
his
country
was
intensified
as
months
passed
his
faith
in
his
country
was
not
lessened
and
yet
wherein
was
the
efficacy
of
grim
words
about
british
tenacity
the
great
new
somme
offensive
was
not
succeeding
in
the
north
was
victory
possible
was
victory
deserved
in
his
daily
labour
he
was
brought
into
contact
with
too
many
instances
of
official
selfishness
folly
ignorance
stupidity
and
sloth
french
as
well
as
british
not
to
marvel
at
times
that
the
conflict
had
not
come
to
an
ignominious
end
long
ago
through
simple
lack
of
imagination
he
knew
that
he
himself
had
often
failed
in
devotion
in
rectitude
in
sheer
grit
the
supreme
lesson
of
the
war
was
its
revelation
of
what
human
nature
actually
was
and
the
solace
of
the
lesson
the
hope
for
triumph
lay
in
the
fact
that
human
nature
must
be
substantially
the
same
throughout
the
world
if
we
were
humanly
imperfect
so
at
least
was
the
enemy
perhaps
the
frame
of
society
was
about
to
collapse
perhaps
queen
deliberately
courting
destruction
and
being
destroyed
was
the
symbol
of
society
what
matter
perhaps
civilisation
by
its
nobility
and
its
elements
of
reason
and
by
the
favour
of
destiny
would
be
saved
from
disaster
after
frightful
danger
and
concepcion
was
its
symbol
all
he
knew
was
that
he
had
a
heavy
day
work
before
him
on
the
morrow
and
in
relief
from
pain
and
insoluble
problems
he
turned
to
face
that
work
thankful
thankful
that
owing
originally
to
queen
he
had
discovered
in
the
war
a
task
which
suited
his
powers
which
was
genuinely
useful
and
which
would
only
finish
with
the
war
thankful
for
the
prospect
of
meeting
concepcion
at
the
and
exploring
with
her
the
marvellous
provocative
potentialities
that
now
drew
them
together
thankful
too
that
he
had
a
balanced
and
sagacious
mind
and
could
judge
justly
yes
he
was
already
forgetting
his
bitter
condemnation
of
himself
as
a
simpleton
how
in
his
human
could
he
be
expected
to
know
that
he
had
judged
the
negligible
christine
unjustly
was
he
divine
that
he
could
see
in
the
figure
of
the
wanton
who
peered
at
soldiers
in
the
street
a
mystic
envoy
of
the
most
clement
virgin
an
envoy
passionately
repentant
after
apostasy
bound
at
all
costs
to
respond
to
an
imagined
voice
long
unheard
and
seeking
though
in
vain
this
second
time
the
protégé
of
the
virgin
so
that
she
might
once
more
succour
and
assuage
his
affliction
