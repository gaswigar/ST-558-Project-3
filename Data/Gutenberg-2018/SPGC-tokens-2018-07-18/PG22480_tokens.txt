the
prussian
officer
i
they
had
marched
more
than
thirty
kilometres
since
dawn
along
the
white
hot
road
where
occasional
thickets
of
trees
threw
a
moment
of
shade
then
out
into
the
glare
again
on
either
hand
the
valley
wide
and
shallow
glittered
with
heat
dark
green
patches
of
rye
pale
young
corn
fallow
and
meadow
and
black
pine
woods
spread
in
a
dull
hot
diagram
under
a
glistening
sky
but
right
in
front
the
mountains
ranged
across
pale
blue
and
very
still
snow
gleaming
gently
out
of
the
deep
atmosphere
and
towards
the
mountains
on
and
on
the
regiment
marched
between
the
rye
fields
and
the
meadows
between
the
scraggy
fruit
trees
set
regularly
on
either
side
the
high
road
the
burnished
dark
green
rye
threw
on
a
suffocating
heat
the
mountains
drew
gradually
nearer
and
more
distinct
while
the
feet
of
the
soldiers
grew
hotter
sweat
ran
through
their
hair
under
their
helmets
and
their
knapsacks
could
burn
no
more
in
contact
with
their
shoulders
but
seemed
instead
to
give
off
a
cold
prickly
sensation
he
walked
on
and
on
in
silence
staring
at
the
mountains
ahead
that
rose
sheer
out
of
the
land
and
stood
fold
behind
fold
half
earth
half
heaven
the
heaven
the
banner
with
slits
of
soft
snow
in
the
pale
bluish
peaks
he
could
now
walk
almost
without
pain
at
the
start
he
had
determined
not
to
limp
it
had
made
him
sick
to
take
the
first
steps
and
during
the
first
mile
or
so
he
had
compressed
his
breath
and
the
cold
drops
of
sweat
had
stood
on
his
forehead
but
he
had
walked
it
off
what
were
they
after
all
but
bruises
he
had
looked
at
them
as
he
was
getting
up
deep
bruises
on
the
backs
of
his
thighs
and
since
he
had
made
his
first
step
in
the
morning
he
had
been
conscious
of
them
till
now
he
had
a
tight
hot
place
in
his
chest
with
suppressing
the
pain
and
holding
himself
in
there
seemed
no
air
when
he
breathed
but
he
walked
almost
lightly
the
captain
hand
had
trembled
at
taking
his
coffee
at
dawn
his
orderly
saw
it
again
and
he
saw
the
fine
figure
of
the
captain
wheeling
on
horseback
at
the
ahead
a
handsome
figure
in
pale
blue
uniform
with
facings
of
scarlet
and
the
metal
gleaming
on
the
black
helmet
and
the
and
dark
streaks
of
sweat
coming
on
the
silky
bay
horse
the
orderly
felt
he
was
connected
with
that
figure
moving
so
suddenly
on
horseback
he
followed
it
like
a
shadow
mute
and
inevitable
and
damned
by
it
and
the
officer
was
always
aware
of
the
tramp
of
the
company
behind
the
march
of
his
orderly
among
the
men
the
captain
was
a
tall
man
of
about
forty
grey
at
the
temples
he
had
a
handsome
finely
knit
figure
and
was
one
of
the
best
horsemen
in
the
west
his
orderly
having
to
rub
him
down
admired
the
amazing
of
his
loins
for
the
rest
the
orderly
scarcely
noticed
the
officer
any
more
than
he
noticed
himself
it
was
rarely
he
saw
his
master
face
he
did
not
look
at
it
the
captain
had
stilt
hair
that
he
wore
short
upon
his
skull
his
moustache
was
also
cut
short
and
bristly
over
a
full
brutal
mouth
his
face
was
rather
rugged
the
cheeks
thin
perhaps
the
man
was
the
more
handsome
for
the
deep
lines
in
his
face
the
irritable
tension
of
his
brow
which
gave
him
the
look
of
a
man
who
fights
with
life
his
fair
eyebrows
stood
bushy
over
light
blue
eyes
that
were
always
flashing
with
cold
fire
he
was
a
prussian
aristocrat
haughty
and
overbearing
but
his
mother
had
been
a
polish
countess
having
made
too
many
gambling
debts
when
he
was
young
he
had
ruined
his
prospects
in
the
army
and
remained
an
infantry
captain
he
had
never
married
his
position
did
not
allow
of
it
and
no
woman
had
ever
moved
him
to
it
his
time
he
spent
he
rode
one
of
his
own
horses
at
the
at
the
officers
club
now
and
then
he
took
himself
a
mistress
but
after
such
an
event
he
returned
to
duty
with
his
brow
still
more
tense
his
eyes
still
more
hostile
and
irritable
with
the
men
however
he
was
merely
impersonal
though
a
devil
when
roused
so
that
on
the
whole
they
feared
him
but
had
no
great
aversion
from
him
they
accepted
him
as
the
inevitable
to
his
orderly
he
was
at
first
cold
and
just
and
indifferent
he
did
not
fuss
over
trifles
so
that
his
servant
knew
practically
nothing
about
him
except
just
what
orders
he
would
give
and
how
he
wanted
them
obeyed
that
was
quite
simple
then
the
change
gradually
came
the
orderly
was
a
youth
of
about
of
medium
height
and
well
built
he
had
strong
heavy
limbs
was
swarthy
with
a
soft
black
young
moustache
there
was
something
altogether
warm
and
young
about
him
he
had
firmly
marked
eyebrows
over
dark
expressionless
eyes
that
seemed
never
to
have
thought
only
to
have
received
life
direct
through
his
senses
and
acted
straight
from
instinct
gradually
the
officer
had
become
aware
of
his
servant
young
vigorous
unconscious
presence
about
him
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
sense
of
the
youth
person
while
he
was
in
attendance
it
was
like
a
warm
flame
upon
the
older
man
tense
rigid
body
that
had
become
almost
unliving
fixed
there
was
something
so
free
and
about
him
and
something
in
the
young
fellow
movement
that
made
the
officer
aware
of
him
and
this
irritated
the
prussian
he
did
not
choose
to
be
touched
into
life
by
his
servant
he
might
easily
have
changed
his
man
but
he
did
not
he
now
very
rarely
looked
direct
at
his
orderly
but
kept
his
face
averted
as
if
to
avoid
seeing
him
and
yet
as
the
young
soldier
moved
unthinking
about
the
apartment
the
elder
watched
him
and
would
notice
the
movement
of
his
strong
young
shoulders
under
the
blue
cloth
the
bend
of
his
neck
and
it
irritated
him
to
see
the
soldier
young
brown
shapely
peasant
hand
grasp
the
loaf
or
the
sent
a
flash
of
hate
or
of
anger
through
the
elder
man
blood
it
was
not
that
the
youth
was
clumsy
it
was
rather
the
blind
instinctive
sureness
of
movement
of
an
unhampered
young
animal
that
irritated
the
officer
to
such
a
degree
once
when
a
bottle
of
wine
had
gone
over
and
the
red
gushed
out
on
to
the
tablecloth
the
officer
had
started
up
with
an
oath
and
his
eyes
bluey
like
fire
had
held
those
of
the
confused
youth
for
a
moment
it
was
a
shock
for
the
young
soldier
he
felt
something
sink
deeper
deeper
into
his
soul
where
nothing
had
ever
gone
before
it
left
him
rather
blank
and
wondering
some
of
his
natural
completeness
in
himself
was
gone
a
little
uneasiness
took
its
place
and
from
that
time
an
undiscovered
feeling
had
held
between
the
two
men
henceforward
the
orderly
was
afraid
of
really
meeting
his
master
his
subconsciousness
remembered
those
steely
blue
eyes
and
the
harsh
brows
and
did
not
intend
to
meet
them
again
so
he
always
stared
past
his
master
and
avoided
him
also
in
a
little
anxiety
he
waited
for
the
three
months
to
have
gone
when
his
time
would
be
up
he
began
to
feel
a
constraint
in
the
captain
presence
and
the
soldier
even
more
than
the
officer
wanted
to
be
left
alone
in
his
neutrality
as
servant
he
had
served
the
captain
for
more
than
a
year
and
knew
his
duty
this
he
performed
easily
as
if
it
were
natural
to
him
the
officer
and
his
commands
he
took
for
granted
as
he
took
the
sun
and
the
rain
and
he
served
as
a
matter
of
course
it
did
not
implicate
him
personally
but
now
if
he
were
going
to
be
forced
into
a
personal
interchange
with
his
master
he
would
be
like
a
wild
thing
caught
he
felt
he
must
get
away
but
the
influence
of
the
young
soldier
being
had
penetrated
through
the
officer
stiffened
discipline
and
perturbed
the
man
in
him
he
however
was
a
gentleman
with
long
fine
hands
and
cultivated
movements
and
was
not
going
to
allow
such
a
thing
as
the
stirring
of
his
innate
self
he
was
a
man
of
passionate
temper
who
had
always
kept
himself
suppressed
occasionally
there
had
been
a
duel
an
outburst
before
the
soldiers
he
knew
himself
to
be
always
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
but
he
kept
himself
hard
to
the
idea
of
the
service
whereas
the
young
soldier
seemed
to
live
out
his
warm
full
nature
to
give
it
off
in
his
very
movements
which
had
a
certain
zest
such
as
wild
animals
have
in
free
movement
and
this
irritated
the
officer
more
and
more
in
spite
of
himself
the
captain
could
not
regain
his
neutrality
of
feeling
towards
his
orderly
nor
could
he
leave
the
man
alone
in
spite
of
himself
he
watched
him
gave
him
sharp
orders
tried
to
take
up
as
much
of
his
time
as
possible
sometimes
he
flew
into
a
rage
with
the
young
soldier
and
bullied
him
then
the
orderly
shut
himself
off
as
it
were
out
of
earshot
and
waited
with
sullen
flushed
face
for
the
end
of
the
noise
the
words
never
pierced
to
his
intelligence
he
made
himself
protectively
impervious
to
the
feelings
of
his
master
he
had
a
scar
on
his
left
thumb
a
deep
seam
going
across
the
knuckle
the
officer
had
long
suffered
from
it
and
wanted
to
do
something
to
it
still
it
was
there
ugly
and
brutal
on
the
young
brown
hand
at
last
the
captain
reserve
gave
way
one
day
as
the
orderly
was
smoothing
out
the
tablecloth
the
officer
pinned
down
his
thumb
with
a
pencil
asking
how
did
you
come
by
that
the
young
man
winced
and
drew
back
at
attention
a
wood
axe
herr
hauptmann
he
answered
the
officer
waited
for
further
explanation
none
came
the
orderly
went
about
his
duties
the
elder
man
was
sullenly
angry
his
servant
avoided
him
and
the
next
day
he
had
to
use
all
his
willpower
to
avoid
seeing
the
scarred
thumb
he
wanted
to
get
hold
of
it
a
hot
flame
ran
in
his
blood
he
knew
his
servant
would
soon
be
free
and
would
be
glad
as
yet
the
soldier
had
held
himself
off
from
the
elder
man
the
captain
grew
madly
irritable
he
could
not
rest
when
the
soldier
was
away
and
when
he
was
present
he
glared
at
him
with
tormented
eyes
he
hated
those
fine
black
brows
over
the
unmeaning
dark
eyes
he
was
infuriated
by
the
free
movement
of
the
handsome
limbs
which
no
military
discipline
could
make
stiff
and
he
became
harsh
and
cruelly
bullying
using
contempt
and
satire
the
young
soldier
only
grew
more
mute
and
expressionless
what
cattle
were
you
bred
by
that
you
ca
keep
straight
eyes
look
me
in
the
eyes
when
i
speak
to
you
and
the
soldier
turned
his
dark
eyes
to
the
other
face
but
there
was
no
sight
in
them
he
stared
with
the
slightest
possible
cast
holding
back
his
sight
perceiving
the
blue
of
his
master
eyes
but
receiving
no
look
from
them
and
the
elder
man
went
pale
and
his
reddish
eyebrows
twitched
he
gave
his
order
barrenly
once
he
flung
a
heavy
military
glove
into
the
young
soldier
face
then
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
black
eyes
flare
up
into
his
own
like
a
blaze
when
straw
is
thrown
on
a
fire
and
he
had
laughed
with
a
little
tremor
and
a
sneer
but
there
were
only
two
months
more
the
youth
instinctively
tried
to
keep
himself
intact
he
tried
to
serve
the
officer
as
if
the
latter
were
an
abstract
authority
and
not
a
man
all
his
instinct
was
to
avoid
personal
contact
even
definite
hate
but
in
spite
of
himself
the
hate
grew
responsive
to
the
officer
passion
however
he
put
it
in
the
background
when
he
had
left
the
army
he
could
dare
acknowledge
it
by
nature
he
was
active
and
had
many
friends
he
thought
what
amazing
good
fellows
they
were
but
without
knowing
it
he
was
alone
now
this
solitariness
was
intensified
it
would
carry
him
through
his
term
but
the
officer
seemed
to
be
going
irritably
insane
and
the
youth
was
deeply
frightened
the
soldier
had
a
sweetheart
a
girl
from
the
mountains
independent
and
primitive
the
two
walked
together
rather
silently
he
went
with
her
not
to
talk
but
to
have
his
arm
round
her
and
for
the
physical
contact
this
eased
him
made
it
easier
for
him
to
ignore
the
captain
for
he
could
rest
with
her
held
fast
against
his
chest
and
she
in
some
unspoken
fashion
was
there
for
him
they
loved
each
other
the
captain
perceived
it
and
was
mad
with
irritation
he
kept
the
young
man
engaged
all
the
evenings
long
and
took
pleasure
in
the
dark
look
that
came
on
his
face
occasionally
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
those
of
the
younger
sullen
and
dark
doggedly
unalterable
those
of
the
elder
sneering
with
restless
contempt
the
officer
tried
hard
not
to
admit
the
passion
that
had
got
hold
of
him
he
would
not
know
that
his
feeling
for
his
orderly
was
anything
but
that
of
a
man
incensed
by
his
stupid
perverse
servant
so
keeping
quite
justified
and
conventional
in
his
consciousness
he
let
the
other
thing
run
on
his
nerves
however
were
suffering
at
last
he
slung
the
end
of
a
belt
in
his
servant
face
when
he
saw
the
youth
start
back
the
in
his
eyes
and
the
blood
on
his
mouth
he
had
felt
at
once
a
thrill
of
deep
pleasure
and
of
shame
but
this
he
acknowledged
to
himself
was
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
the
fellow
was
too
exasperating
his
own
nerves
must
be
going
to
pieces
he
went
away
for
some
days
with
a
woman
it
was
a
mockery
of
pleasure
he
simply
did
not
want
the
woman
but
he
stayed
on
for
his
time
at
the
end
of
it
he
came
back
in
an
agony
of
irritation
torment
and
misery
he
rode
all
the
evening
then
came
straight
in
to
supper
his
orderly
was
out
the
officer
sat
with
his
long
fine
hands
lying
on
the
table
perfectly
still
and
all
his
blood
seemed
to
be
corroding
at
last
his
servant
entered
he
watched
the
strong
easy
young
figure
the
fine
eyebrows
the
thick
black
hair
in
a
week
time
the
youth
had
got
back
his
old
the
hands
of
the
officer
twitched
and
seemed
to
be
full
of
mad
flame
the
young
man
stood
at
attention
unmoving
shut
on
the
meal
went
in
silence
but
the
orderly
seemed
eager
he
made
a
clatter
with
the
dishes
are
you
in
a
hurry
asked
the
officer
watching
the
intent
warm
face
of
his
servant
the
other
did
not
reply
will
you
answer
my
question
said
the
captain
yes
sir
replied
the
orderly
standing
with
his
pile
of
deep
army
plates
the
captain
waited
looked
at
him
then
asked
again
are
you
in
a
hurry
yes
sir
came
the
answer
that
sent
a
flash
through
the
listener
for
what
i
was
going
out
i
want
you
this
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
the
officer
had
a
curious
stiffness
of
countenance
yes
sir
replied
the
servant
in
his
throat
i
want
you
tomorrow
evening
fact
you
may
consider
your
evenings
occupied
unless
i
give
you
the
mouth
with
the
young
moustache
set
close
yes
sir
answered
the
orderly
loosening
his
lips
for
a
moment
he
again
turned
to
the
door
and
why
have
you
a
piece
of
pencil
in
your
ear
the
orderly
hesitated
then
continued
on
his
way
without
answering
he
set
the
plates
in
a
pile
outside
the
door
took
the
stump
of
pencil
from
his
ear
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
had
been
copying
a
verse
for
his
sweetheart
birthday
card
he
returned
to
finish
clearing
the
table
the
officer
eyes
were
dancing
he
had
a
little
eager
smile
why
have
you
a
piece
of
pencil
in
your
ear
he
asked
the
orderly
took
his
hands
full
of
dishes
his
master
was
standing
near
the
great
green
stove
a
little
smile
on
his
face
his
chin
thrust
forward
when
the
young
soldier
saw
him
his
heart
suddenly
ran
hot
he
felt
blind
instead
of
answering
he
turned
dazedly
to
the
door
as
he
was
crouching
to
set
down
the
dishes
he
was
pitched
forward
by
a
kick
from
behind
the
pots
went
in
a
stream
down
the
stairs
he
clung
to
the
pillar
of
the
banisters
and
as
he
was
rising
he
was
kicked
heavily
again
and
again
so
that
he
clung
sickly
to
the
post
for
some
moments
his
master
had
gone
swiftly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
the
downstairs
looked
up
the
staircase
and
made
a
mocking
face
at
the
crockery
disaster
the
officer
heart
was
plunging
he
poured
himself
a
glass
of
wine
part
of
which
he
spilled
on
the
floor
and
gulped
the
remainder
leaning
against
the
cool
green
stove
he
heard
his
man
collecting
the
dishes
from
the
stairs
pale
as
if
intoxicated
he
waited
the
servant
entered
again
the
captain
heart
gave
a
pang
as
of
pleasure
seeing
the
young
fellow
bewildered
and
uncertain
on
his
feet
with
pain
schöner
he
said
the
soldier
was
a
little
slower
in
coming
to
attention
yes
sir
the
youth
stood
before
him
with
pathetic
young
moustache
and
fine
eyebrows
very
distinct
on
his
forehead
of
dark
marble
i
asked
you
a
yes
the
officer
tone
bit
like
acid
why
had
you
a
pencil
in
your
ear
again
the
servant
heart
ran
hot
and
he
could
not
breathe
with
dark
strained
eyes
he
looked
at
the
officer
as
if
fascinated
and
he
stood
there
sturdily
planted
unconscious
the
withering
smile
came
into
the
captain
eyes
and
he
lifted
his
foot
forgot
panted
the
soldier
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
the
other
man
dancing
blue
ones
what
was
it
doing
there
he
saw
the
young
man
breast
heaving
as
he
made
an
effort
for
words
i
had
been
writing
what
again
the
soldier
looked
him
up
and
down
the
officer
could
hear
him
panting
the
smile
came
into
the
blue
eyes
the
soldier
worked
his
dry
throat
but
could
not
speak
suddenly
the
smile
lit
like
a
name
on
the
officer
face
and
a
kick
came
heavily
against
the
orderly
thigh
the
youth
moved
a
pace
sideways
his
face
went
dead
with
two
black
staring
eyes
well
said
the
officer
the
orderly
mouth
had
gone
dry
and
his
tongue
rubbed
in
it
as
on
dry
he
worked
his
throat
the
officer
raised
his
foot
the
servant
went
stiff
some
poetry
sir
came
the
crackling
unrecognizable
sound
of
his
voice
poetry
what
poetry
asked
the
captain
with
a
sickly
smile
again
there
was
the
working
in
the
throat
the
captain
heart
had
suddenly
gone
down
heavily
and
he
stood
sick
and
tired
for
my
girl
sir
he
heard
the
dry
inhuman
sound
oh
he
said
turning
away
clear
the
click
went
the
soldier
throat
then
again
click
and
then
the
yes
the
young
soldier
was
gone
looking
old
and
walking
heavily
the
officer
left
alone
held
himself
rigid
to
prevent
himself
from
thinking
his
instinct
warned
him
that
he
must
not
think
deep
inside
him
was
the
intense
gratification
of
his
passion
still
working
powerfully
then
there
was
a
a
horrible
breaking
down
of
something
inside
him
a
whole
agony
of
reaction
he
stood
there
for
an
hour
motionless
a
chaos
of
sensations
but
rigid
with
a
will
to
keep
blank
his
consciousness
to
prevent
his
mind
grasping
and
he
held
himself
so
until
the
worst
of
the
stress
had
passed
when
he
began
to
drink
drank
himself
to
an
intoxication
till
he
slept
obliterated
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
he
was
shaken
to
the
base
of
his
nature
but
he
had
fought
off
the
realization
of
what
he
had
done
he
had
prevented
his
mind
from
taking
it
in
had
suppressed
it
along
with
his
instincts
and
the
conscious
man
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
felt
only
as
after
a
bout
of
intoxication
weak
but
the
affair
itself
all
dim
and
not
to
be
recovered
of
the
drunkenness
of
his
passion
he
successfully
refused
remembrance
and
when
his
orderly
appeared
with
coffee
the
officer
assumed
the
same
self
he
had
had
the
morning
before
he
refused
the
event
of
the
past
it
had
ever
was
successful
in
his
denial
he
had
not
done
any
such
he
himself
whatever
there
might
be
lay
at
the
door
of
a
stupid
insubordinate
servant
the
orderly
had
gone
about
in
a
stupor
all
the
evening
he
drank
some
beer
because
he
was
parched
but
not
much
the
alcohol
made
his
feeling
come
back
and
he
could
not
bear
it
he
was
dulled
as
if
of
the
ordinary
man
in
him
were
inert
he
crawled
about
disfigured
still
when
he
thought
of
the
kicks
he
went
sick
and
when
he
thought
of
the
threat
of
more
kicking
in
the
room
afterwards
his
heart
went
hot
and
faint
and
he
panted
remembering
the
one
that
had
come
he
had
been
forced
to
say
for
my
he
was
much
too
done
even
to
want
to
cry
his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
like
an
idiot
he
felt
vacant
and
wasted
so
he
wandered
at
his
work
painfully
and
very
slowly
and
clumsily
fumbling
blindly
with
the
brushes
and
finding
it
difficult
when
he
sat
down
to
summon
the
energy
to
move
again
his
limbs
his
jaw
were
slack
and
nerveless
but
he
was
very
tired
he
got
to
bed
at
last
and
slept
inert
relaxed
in
a
sleep
that
was
rather
stupor
than
slumber
a
dead
night
of
stupefaction
shot
through
with
gleams
of
anguish
in
the
morning
were
the
manœuvres
but
he
woke
even
before
the
bugle
sounded
the
painful
ache
in
his
chest
the
dryness
of
his
throat
the
awful
steady
feeling
of
misery
made
his
eyes
come
awake
and
dreary
at
once
he
knew
without
thinking
what
had
happened
and
he
knew
that
the
day
had
come
again
when
he
must
go
on
with
his
round
the
last
bit
of
darkness
was
being
pushed
out
of
the
room
he
would
have
to
move
his
inert
body
and
go
on
he
was
so
young
and
had
known
so
little
trouble
that
he
was
bewildered
he
only
wished
it
would
stay
night
so
that
he
could
lie
still
covered
up
by
the
darkness
and
yet
nothing
would
prevent
the
day
from
coming
nothing
would
save
him
from
having
to
get
up
and
saddle
the
captain
horse
and
make
the
captain
coffee
it
was
there
inevitable
and
then
he
thought
it
was
impossible
yet
they
would
not
leave
him
free
he
must
go
and
take
the
coffee
to
the
captain
he
was
too
stunned
to
understand
it
he
only
knew
it
was
however
long
he
lay
inert
at
last
after
heaving
at
himself
for
he
seemed
to
be
a
mass
of
inertia
he
got
up
but
he
had
to
force
every
one
of
his
movements
from
behind
with
his
will
he
felt
lost
and
dazed
and
helpless
then
he
clutched
hold
of
the
bed
the
pain
was
so
keen
and
looking
at
his
thighs
he
saw
the
darker
bruises
on
his
swarthy
flesh
and
he
knew
that
if
he
pressed
one
of
his
fingers
on
one
of
the
bruises
he
should
faint
but
he
did
not
want
to
did
not
want
anybody
to
know
no
one
should
ever
know
it
was
between
him
and
the
captain
there
were
only
the
two
people
in
the
world
and
the
captain
slowly
economically
he
got
dressed
and
forced
himself
to
walk
everything
was
obscure
except
just
what
he
had
his
hands
on
but
he
managed
to
get
through
his
work
the
very
pain
revived
his
dull
senses
the
worst
remained
yet
he
took
the
tray
and
went
up
to
the
room
the
officer
pale
and
heavy
sat
at
the
table
the
orderly
as
he
saluted
felt
himself
put
out
of
existence
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
submitting
to
his
own
nullification
then
he
gathered
himself
seemed
to
regain
himself
and
then
the
captain
began
to
grow
vague
unreal
and
the
younger
soldier
heart
beat
up
he
clung
to
this
the
captain
did
not
that
he
himself
might
live
but
when
he
saw
his
officer
hand
tremble
as
he
took
the
coffee
he
felt
everything
falling
shattered
and
he
went
away
feeling
as
if
he
himself
were
coming
to
pieces
disintegrated
and
when
the
captain
was
there
on
horseback
giving
orders
while
he
himself
stood
with
rifle
and
knapsack
sick
with
pain
he
felt
as
if
he
must
shut
his
if
he
must
shut
his
eyes
on
everything
it
was
only
the
long
agony
of
marching
with
a
parched
throat
that
filled
him
with
one
single
intention
to
save
himself
ii
he
was
getting
used
even
to
his
parched
throat
that
the
snowy
peaks
were
radiant
among
the
sky
that
the
twisted
through
its
pale
shoals
in
the
valley
below
seemed
almost
supernatural
but
he
was
going
mad
with
fever
and
thirst
he
plodded
on
uncomplaining
he
did
not
want
to
speak
not
to
anybody
there
were
two
gulls
like
flakes
of
water
and
snow
over
the
river
the
scent
of
green
rye
soaked
in
sunshine
came
like
a
sickness
and
the
march
continued
monotonously
almost
like
a
bad
sleep
at
the
next
which
stood
low
and
broad
near
the
high
road
tubs
of
water
had
been
put
out
the
soldiers
clustered
round
to
drink
they
took
off
their
helmets
and
the
steam
mounted
from
their
wet
hair
the
captain
sat
on
horseback
watching
he
needed
to
see
his
orderly
his
threw
a
dark
shadow
over
his
light
fierce
eyes
but
his
moustache
and
mouth
and
chin
were
distinct
in
the
sunshine
the
orderly
must
move
under
the
presence
of
the
figure
of
the
horseman
it
was
not
that
he
was
afraid
or
cowed
it
was
as
if
he
was
disembowelled
made
empty
like
an
empty
shell
he
felt
himself
as
nothing
a
shadow
creeping
under
the
sunshine
and
thirsty
as
he
was
he
could
scarcely
drink
feeling
the
captain
near
him
he
would
not
take
off
his
helmet
to
wipe
his
wet
hair
he
wanted
to
stay
in
shadow
not
to
be
forced
into
consciousness
starting
he
saw
the
light
heel
of
the
officer
prick
the
belly
of
the
horse
the
captain
cantered
away
and
he
himself
could
relapse
into
vacancy
nothing
however
could
give
him
back
his
living
place
in
the
hot
bright
morning
he
felt
like
a
gap
among
it
all
whereas
the
captain
was
prouder
overriding
a
hot
flash
went
through
the
young
servant
body
the
captain
was
firmer
and
prouder
with
life
he
himself
was
empty
as
a
shadow
again
the
flash
went
through
him
dazing
him
out
but
his
heart
ran
a
little
firmer
the
company
turned
up
the
hill
to
make
a
loop
for
the
return
below
from
among
the
trees
the
clanged
he
saw
the
labourers
mowing
barefoot
at
the
thick
grass
leave
off
their
work
and
go
downhill
their
scythes
hanging
over
their
shoulders
like
long
bright
claws
curving
down
behind
them
they
seemed
like
as
if
they
had
no
relation
to
himself
he
felt
as
in
a
blackish
dream
as
if
all
the
other
things
were
there
and
had
form
but
he
himself
was
only
a
consciousness
a
gap
that
could
think
and
perceive
the
soldiers
were
tramping
silently
up
the
glaring
hillside
gradually
his
head
began
to
revolve
slowly
rhythmically
sometimes
it
was
dark
before
his
eyes
as
if
he
saw
this
world
through
a
smoked
glass
frail
shadows
and
unreal
it
gave
him
a
pain
in
his
head
to
walk
the
air
was
too
scented
it
gave
no
breath
all
the
lush
seemed
to
be
issuing
its
sap
till
the
air
was
deathly
sickly
with
the
smell
of
greenness
there
was
the
perfume
of
clover
like
pure
honey
and
bees
then
there
grew
a
faint
acrid
were
near
the
beeches
and
then
a
queer
clattering
noise
and
a
suffocating
hideous
smell
they
were
passing
a
flock
of
sheep
a
shepherd
in
a
black
smock
holding
his
crook
why
should
the
sheep
huddle
together
under
this
fierce
sun
he
felt
that
the
shepherd
would
not
see
him
though
he
could
see
the
shepherd
at
last
there
was
the
halt
they
stacked
rifles
in
a
conical
stack
put
down
their
kit
in
a
scattered
circle
around
it
and
dispersed
a
little
sitting
on
a
small
knoll
high
on
the
hillside
the
chatter
began
the
soldiers
were
steaming
with
heat
but
were
lively
he
sat
still
seeing
the
blue
mountains
rising
upon
the
land
twenty
kilometres
away
there
was
a
blue
fold
in
the
ranges
then
out
of
that
at
the
foot
the
broad
pale
bed
of
the
river
stretches
of
water
between
shoals
among
the
dark
pine
woods
there
it
was
spread
out
a
long
way
off
and
it
seemed
to
come
downhill
the
river
there
was
a
raft
being
steered
a
mile
away
it
was
a
strange
country
nearer
a
broad
farm
with
white
base
and
square
dots
of
windows
crouched
beside
the
wall
of
beech
foliage
on
the
wood
edge
there
were
long
strips
of
rye
and
clover
and
pale
green
corn
and
just
at
his
feet
below
the
knoll
was
a
darkish
bog
where
globe
flowers
stood
breathless
still
on
their
slim
stalks
and
some
of
the
pale
gold
bubbles
were
burst
and
a
broken
fragment
hung
in
the
air
he
thought
he
was
going
to
sleep
suddenly
something
moved
into
this
coloured
mirage
before
his
eyes
the
captain
a
small
and
scarlet
figure
was
trotting
evenly
between
the
strips
of
corn
along
the
level
brow
of
the
hill
and
the
man
making
was
coming
on
proud
and
sure
moved
the
horseman
figure
the
quick
bright
thing
in
which
was
concentrated
all
the
light
of
this
morning
which
for
the
rest
lay
a
fragile
shining
shadow
submissive
apathetic
the
young
soldier
sat
and
stared
but
as
the
horse
slowed
to
a
walk
coming
up
the
last
steep
path
the
great
flash
flared
over
the
body
and
soul
of
the
orderly
he
sat
waiting
the
back
of
his
head
felt
as
if
it
were
weighted
with
a
heavy
piece
of
fire
he
did
not
want
to
eat
his
hands
trembled
slightly
as
he
moved
them
meanwhile
the
officer
on
horseback
was
approaching
slowly
and
proudly
the
tension
grew
in
the
orderly
soul
then
again
seeing
the
captain
ease
himself
on
the
saddle
the
flash
blazed
through
him
the
captain
looked
at
the
patch
of
light
blue
and
scarlet
and
dark
heads
scattered
closely
on
the
hillside
it
pleased
him
the
command
pleased
him
and
he
was
feeling
proud
his
orderly
was
among
them
in
common
subjection
the
officer
rose
a
little
on
his
stirrups
to
look
the
young
soldier
sat
with
averted
dumb
face
the
captain
relaxed
on
his
seat
his
beautiful
horse
brown
as
a
beech
nut
walked
proudly
uphill
the
captain
passed
into
the
zone
of
the
atmosphere
a
hot
smell
of
men
of
sweat
of
leather
he
knew
it
very
well
after
a
word
with
the
lieutenant
he
went
a
few
paces
higher
and
sat
there
a
dominant
figure
his
horse
swishing
its
tail
while
he
looked
down
on
his
men
on
his
orderly
a
nonentity
among
the
crowd
the
young
soldier
heart
was
like
fire
in
his
chest
and
he
breathed
with
difficulty
the
officer
looking
downhill
saw
three
of
the
young
soldiers
two
pails
of
water
between
them
staggering
across
a
sunny
green
field
a
table
had
been
set
up
under
a
tree
and
there
the
slim
lieutenant
stood
importantly
busy
then
the
captain
summoned
himself
to
an
act
of
courage
he
called
his
orderly
the
name
leapt
into
the
young
soldier
throat
as
he
heard
the
command
and
he
rose
blindly
stifled
he
saluted
standing
below
the
officer
he
did
not
look
up
but
there
was
the
flicker
in
the
captain
voice
go
to
the
inn
and
fetch
me
the
officer
gave
his
commands
quick
he
added
at
the
last
word
the
heart
of
the
servant
leapt
with
a
flash
and
he
felt
the
strength
come
over
his
body
but
he
turned
in
mechanical
obedience
and
set
on
at
a
heavy
run
downhill
looking
almost
like
a
bear
his
trousers
bagging
over
his
military
boots
and
the
officer
watched
this
blind
plunging
run
all
the
way
but
it
was
only
the
outside
of
the
orderly
body
that
was
obeying
so
humbly
and
mechanically
inside
had
gradually
accumulated
a
core
into
which
all
the
energy
of
that
young
life
was
compact
and
concentrated
he
executed
his
commisssion
and
plodded
quickly
back
uphill
there
was
a
pain
in
his
head
as
he
walked
that
made
him
twist
his
features
unknowingly
but
hard
there
in
the
centre
of
his
chest
was
himself
himself
firm
and
not
to
be
plucked
to
pieces
the
captain
had
gone
up
into
the
wood
the
orderly
plodded
through
the
hot
powerfully
smelling
zone
of
the
company
atmosphere
he
had
a
curious
mass
of
energy
inside
him
now
the
captain
was
less
real
than
himself
he
approached
the
green
entrance
to
the
wood
there
in
the
he
saw
the
horse
standing
the
sunshine
and
the
tuckering
shadow
of
leaves
dancing
over
his
brown
body
there
was
a
clearing
where
timber
had
lately
been
felled
here
in
the
shade
beside
the
brilliant
cup
of
sunshine
stood
two
figures
blue
and
pink
the
bits
of
pink
showing
out
plainly
the
captain
was
talking
to
his
lieutenant
the
orderly
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
bright
clearing
where
great
trunks
of
trees
stripped
and
glistening
lay
stretched
like
naked
bodies
chips
of
wood
littered
the
trampled
floor
like
splashed
light
and
the
bases
of
the
felled
trees
stood
here
and
there
with
their
raw
level
tops
beyond
was
the
brilliant
sunlit
green
of
a
beech
then
i
will
ride
forward
the
orderly
heard
his
captain
say
the
lieutenant
saluted
and
strode
away
he
himself
went
forward
a
hot
flash
passed
through
his
belly
as
he
tramped
towards
his
officer
the
captain
watched
the
rather
heavy
figure
of
the
young
soldier
stumble
forward
and
his
veins
too
ran
hot
this
was
to
be
man
to
man
between
them
he
yielded
before
the
solid
stumbling
figure
with
bent
head
the
orderly
stooped
and
put
the
food
on
a
the
captain
watched
the
glistening
naked
hands
he
wanted
to
speak
to
the
young
soldier
but
could
not
the
servant
propped
a
bottle
against
his
thigh
pressed
open
the
cork
and
poured
out
the
beer
into
the
mug
he
kept
his
head
bent
the
captain
accepted
the
mug
hot
he
said
as
if
amiably
the
flame
sprang
out
of
the
orderly
heart
nearly
suffocating
him
yes
sir
he
replied
between
shut
teeth
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
captain
drinking
and
he
clenched
his
fists
such
a
strong
torment
came
into
his
wrists
then
came
the
faint
clang
of
the
closing
of
the
he
looked
up
the
captain
was
watching
him
he
glanced
swiftly
away
then
he
saw
the
officer
stoop
and
take
a
piece
of
bread
from
the
again
the
flash
of
flame
went
through
the
young
soldier
seeing
the
stiff
body
stoop
beneath
him
and
his
hands
jerked
he
looked
away
he
could
feel
the
officer
was
nervous
the
bread
fell
as
it
was
being
broken
the
officer
ate
the
other
piece
the
two
men
stood
tense
and
still
the
master
laboriously
chewing
his
bread
the
servant
staring
with
averted
face
his
fist
clenched
then
the
young
soldier
started
the
officer
had
pressed
open
the
lid
of
the
mug
again
the
orderly
watched
the
lid
of
the
mug
and
the
white
hand
that
clenched
the
handle
as
if
he
were
fascinated
it
was
raised
the
youth
followed
it
with
his
eyes
and
then
he
saw
the
thin
strong
throat
of
the
elder
man
moving
up
and
down
as
he
drank
the
strong
jaw
working
and
the
instinct
which
had
been
jerking
at
the
young
wrists
suddenly
jerked
free
he
jumped
feeling
as
if
it
were
rent
in
two
by
a
strong
flame
the
spur
of
the
officer
caught
in
a
he
went
down
backwards
with
a
crash
the
middle
of
his
back
thudding
sickeningly
against
a
the
pot
flying
away
and
in
a
second
the
orderly
with
serious
earnest
young
face
and
between
his
teeth
had
got
his
knee
in
the
officer
chest
and
was
pressing
the
chin
backward
over
the
farther
edge
of
the
pressing
with
all
his
heart
behind
in
a
passion
of
relief
the
tension
of
his
wrists
exquisite
with
relief
and
with
the
base
of
his
palms
he
shoved
at
the
chin
with
all
his
might
and
it
was
pleasant
too
to
have
that
chin
that
hard
jaw
already
slightly
rough
with
beard
in
his
hands
he
did
not
relax
one
hair
breadth
but
all
the
force
of
all
his
blood
exulting
in
his
thrust
he
shoved
back
the
head
of
the
other
man
till
there
was
a
little
cluck
and
a
crunching
sensation
then
he
felt
as
if
his
head
went
to
vapour
heavy
convulsions
shook
the
body
of
the
officer
frightening
and
horrifying
the
young
soldier
yet
it
pleased
him
too
to
repress
them
it
pleased
him
to
keep
his
hands
pressing
back
the
chin
to
feel
the
chest
of
the
other
man
yield
in
expiration
to
the
weight
of
his
strong
young
knees
to
feel
the
hard
twitchings
of
the
prostrate
body
jerking
his
own
whole
frame
which
was
pressed
down
on
it
but
it
went
still
he
could
look
into
the
nostrils
of
the
other
man
the
eyes
he
could
scarcely
see
how
curiously
the
mouth
was
pushed
out
exaggerating
the
full
lips
and
the
moustache
bristling
up
from
them
then
with
a
start
he
noticed
the
nostrils
gradually
filled
with
blood
the
red
brimmed
hesitated
ran
over
and
went
in
a
thin
trickle
down
the
face
to
the
eyes
it
shocked
and
distressed
him
slowly
he
got
up
the
body
twitched
and
sprawled
there
inert
he
stood
and
looked
at
it
in
silence
it
was
a
pity
it
was
broken
it
represented
more
than
the
thing
which
had
kicked
and
bullied
him
he
was
afraid
to
look
at
the
eyes
they
were
hideous
now
only
the
whites
showing
and
the
blood
running
to
them
the
face
of
the
orderly
was
drawn
with
horror
at
the
sight
well
it
was
so
in
his
heart
he
was
satisfied
he
had
hated
the
face
of
the
captain
it
was
extinguished
now
there
was
a
heavy
relief
in
the
orderly
soul
that
was
as
it
should
be
but
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
long
military
body
lying
broken
over
the
the
fine
fingers
crisped
he
wanted
to
hide
it
away
quickly
busily
he
gathered
it
up
and
pushed
it
under
the
felled
which
rested
their
beautiful
smooth
length
either
end
on
logs
the
face
was
horrible
with
blood
he
covered
it
with
the
helmet
then
he
pushed
the
limbs
straight
and
decent
and
brushed
the
dead
leaves
off
the
fine
cloth
of
the
uniform
so
it
lay
quite
still
in
the
shadow
under
there
a
little
strip
of
sunshine
ran
along
the
breast
from
a
chink
between
the
logs
the
orderly
sat
by
it
for
a
few
moments
here
his
own
life
also
ended
then
through
his
daze
he
heard
the
lieutenant
in
a
loud
voice
explaining
to
the
men
outside
the
wood
that
they
were
to
suppose
the
bridge
on
the
river
below
was
held
by
the
enemy
now
they
were
to
march
to
the
attack
in
such
and
such
a
manner
the
lieutenant
had
no
gift
of
expression
the
orderly
listening
from
habit
got
muddled
and
when
the
lieutenant
began
it
all
again
he
ceased
to
hear
he
knew
he
must
go
he
stood
up
it
surprised
him
that
the
leaves
were
glittering
in
the
sun
and
the
chips
of
wood
reflecting
white
from
the
ground
for
him
a
change
had
come
over
the
world
but
for
the
rest
it
had
seemed
the
same
only
he
had
left
it
and
he
could
not
go
back
it
was
his
duty
to
return
with
the
and
the
bottle
he
could
not
he
had
left
all
that
the
lieutenant
was
still
hoarsely
explaining
he
must
go
or
they
would
overtake
him
and
he
could
not
bear
contact
with
anyone
now
he
drew
his
fingers
over
his
eyes
trying
to
find
out
where
he
was
then
he
turned
away
he
saw
the
horse
standing
in
the
path
he
went
up
to
it
and
mounted
it
hurt
him
to
sit
in
the
saddle
the
pain
of
keeping
his
seat
occupied
him
as
they
cantered
through
the
wood
he
would
not
have
minded
anything
but
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
sense
of
being
divided
from
the
others
the
path
led
out
of
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
pulled
up
and
stood
watching
there
in
the
spacious
sunshine
of
the
valley
soldiers
were
moving
in
a
little
swarm
every
now
and
then
a
man
harrowing
on
a
strip
of
fallow
shouted
to
his
oxen
at
the
turn
the
village
and
the
church
was
small
in
the
sunshine
and
he
no
longer
belonged
to
sat
there
beyond
like
a
man
outside
in
the
dark
he
had
gone
out
from
everyday
life
into
the
unknown
and
he
could
not
he
even
did
not
want
to
go
back
turning
from
the
valley
he
rode
deep
into
the
wood
like
people
standing
grey
and
still
took
no
notice
as
he
went
a
doe
herself
a
moving
bit
of
sunshine
and
shadow
went
running
through
the
flecked
shade
there
were
bright
green
rents
in
the
foliage
then
it
was
all
pine
wood
dark
and
cool
and
he
was
sick
with
pain
he
had
an
intolerable
great
pulse
in
his
head
and
he
was
sick
he
had
never
been
ill
in
his
life
he
felt
lost
quite
dazed
with
all
this
trying
to
get
down
from
the
horse
he
fell
astonished
at
the
pain
and
his
lack
of
balance
the
horse
shifted
uneasily
he
jerked
its
bridle
and
sent
it
cantering
jerkily
away
it
was
his
last
connection
with
the
rest
of
things
but
he
only
wanted
to
lie
down
and
not
be
disturbed
stumbling
through
the
trees
he
came
on
a
quiet
place
where
beeches
and
pine
trees
grew
on
a
slope
immediately
he
had
lain
down
and
closed
his
eyes
his
consciousness
went
racing
on
without
him
a
big
pulse
of
sickness
beat
in
him
as
if
it
throbbed
through
the
whole
earth
he
was
burning
with
dry
heat
but
he
was
too
busy
too
tearingly
active
in
the
incoherent
race
of
delirium
to
observe
iii
he
came
to
with
a
start
his
mouth
was
dry
and
hard
his
heart
beat
heavily
but
he
had
not
the
energy
to
get
up
his
heart
beat
heavily
where
was
he
home
there
was
something
knocking
and
making
an
effort
he
looked
and
litter
of
greenery
and
reddish
night
still
pieces
of
sunshine
on
the
floor
he
did
not
believe
he
was
himself
he
did
not
believe
what
he
saw
something
was
knocking
he
made
a
struggle
towards
consciousness
but
relapsed
then
he
struggled
again
and
gradually
his
surroundings
fell
into
relationship
with
himself
he
knew
and
a
great
pang
of
fear
went
through
his
heart
somebody
was
knocking
he
could
see
the
heavy
black
rags
of
a
fir
tree
overhead
then
everything
went
black
yet
he
did
not
believe
he
had
closed
his
eyes
he
had
not
out
of
the
blackness
sight
slowly
emerged
again
and
someone
was
knocking
quickly
he
saw
the
face
of
his
captain
which
he
hated
and
he
held
himself
still
with
horror
yet
deep
inside
him
he
knew
that
it
was
so
the
captain
should
be
dead
but
the
physical
delirium
got
hold
of
him
someone
was
knocking
he
lay
perfectly
still
as
if
dead
with
fear
and
he
went
unconscious
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
started
seeing
something
creeping
swiftly
up
a
it
was
a
little
bird
and
the
bird
was
whistling
overhead
was
the
small
quick
bird
rapping
the
with
its
beak
as
if
its
head
were
a
little
round
hammer
he
watched
it
curiously
it
shifted
sharply
in
its
creeping
fashion
then
like
a
mouse
it
slid
down
the
bare
trunk
its
swift
creeping
sent
a
flash
of
revulsion
through
him
he
raised
his
head
it
felt
a
great
weight
then
the
little
bird
ran
out
of
the
shadow
across
a
still
patch
of
sunshine
its
little
head
bobbing
swiftly
its
white
legs
twinkling
brightly
for
a
moment
how
neat
it
was
in
its
build
so
compact
with
pieces
of
white
on
its
wings
there
were
several
of
them
they
were
so
they
crept
like
swift
erratic
mice
running
here
and
there
among
the
he
lay
down
again
exhausted
and
his
consciousness
lapsed
he
had
a
horror
of
the
little
creeping
birds
all
his
blood
seemed
to
be
darting
and
creeping
in
his
head
and
yet
he
could
not
move
he
came
to
with
a
further
ache
of
exhaustion
there
was
the
pain
in
his
head
and
the
horrible
sickness
and
his
inability
to
move
he
had
never
been
ill
in
his
life
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
or
what
he
was
probably
he
had
got
sunstroke
or
what
else
had
silenced
the
captain
for
time
a
long
time
ago
there
had
been
blood
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
had
turned
upwards
it
was
all
right
somehow
it
was
peace
but
now
he
had
got
beyond
himself
he
had
never
been
here
before
was
it
life
or
not
life
he
was
by
himself
they
were
in
a
big
bright
place
those
others
and
he
was
outside
the
town
all
the
country
a
big
bright
place
of
light
and
he
was
outside
here
in
the
darkened
open
beyond
where
each
thing
existed
alone
but
they
would
all
have
to
come
out
there
sometime
those
others
little
and
left
behind
him
they
all
were
there
had
been
father
and
mother
and
sweetheart
what
did
they
all
matter
this
was
the
open
land
he
sat
up
something
scuffled
it
was
a
little
brown
squirrel
running
in
lovely
undulating
bounds
over
the
floor
its
red
tail
completing
the
undulation
of
its
then
as
it
sat
up
furling
and
unfurling
he
watched
it
pleased
it
ran
on
friskily
enjoying
itself
it
flew
wildly
at
another
squirrel
and
they
were
chasing
each
other
and
making
little
scolding
chattering
noises
the
soldier
wanted
to
speak
to
them
but
only
a
hoarse
sound
came
out
of
his
throat
the
squirrels
burst
flew
up
the
trees
and
then
he
saw
the
one
peeping
round
at
him
up
a
a
start
of
fear
went
through
him
though
in
so
far
as
he
was
conscious
he
was
amused
it
still
stayed
its
little
keen
face
staring
at
him
halfway
up
the
its
little
ears
pricked
up
its
clawey
little
hands
clinging
to
the
bark
its
white
breast
reared
he
started
from
it
in
panic
struggling
to
his
feet
he
lurched
away
he
went
on
walking
walking
looking
for
something
for
a
drink
his
brain
felt
hot
and
inflamed
for
want
of
water
he
stumbled
on
then
he
did
not
know
anything
he
went
unconscious
as
he
walked
yet
he
stumbled
on
his
mouth
open
when
to
his
dumb
wonder
he
opened
his
eyes
on
the
world
again
he
no
longer
tried
to
remember
what
it
was
there
was
thick
golden
light
behind
glitterings
and
tall
shafts
and
darknesses
further
off
surrounding
him
growing
deeper
he
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
arrival
he
was
amid
the
reality
on
the
real
dark
bottom
but
there
was
the
thirst
burning
in
his
brain
he
felt
lighter
not
so
heavy
he
supposed
it
was
newness
the
air
was
muttering
with
thunder
he
thought
he
was
walking
wonderfully
swiftly
and
was
coming
straight
to
was
it
to
water
suddenly
he
stood
still
with
fear
there
was
a
tremendous
flare
of
gold
a
few
dark
trunks
like
bars
between
him
and
it
all
the
young
level
wheat
was
burnished
gold
glaring
on
its
silky
green
a
woman
a
black
cloth
on
her
head
for
was
passing
like
a
block
of
shadow
through
the
glistening
green
corn
into
the
full
glare
there
was
a
farm
too
pale
blue
in
shadow
and
the
timber
black
and
there
was
a
church
spire
nearly
fused
away
in
the
gold
the
woman
moved
on
away
from
him
he
had
no
language
with
which
to
speak
to
her
she
was
the
bright
solid
unreality
she
would
make
a
noise
of
words
that
would
confuse
him
and
her
eyes
would
look
at
him
without
seeing
him
she
was
crossing
there
to
the
other
side
he
stood
against
a
tree
when
at
last
he
turned
looking
down
the
long
bare
grove
whose
flat
bed
was
already
filling
dark
he
saw
the
mountains
in
a
not
far
away
and
radiant
behind
the
soft
grey
ridge
of
the
nearest
range
the
further
mountains
stood
golden
and
pale
grey
the
snow
all
radiant
like
pure
soft
gold
so
still
gleaming
in
the
sky
fashioned
pure
out
of
the
ore
of
the
sky
they
shone
in
their
silence
he
stood
and
looked
at
them
his
face
illuminated
and
like
the
golden
lustrous
gleaming
of
the
snow
he
felt
his
own
thirst
bright
in
him
he
stood
and
gazed
leaning
against
a
tree
and
then
everything
slid
away
into
space
during
the
night
the
lightning
fluttered
perpetually
making
the
whole
sky
white
he
must
have
walked
again
the
world
hung
livid
round
him
for
moments
fields
a
level
sheen
of
light
trees
in
dark
bulk
and
the
range
of
clouds
black
across
a
white
sky
then
the
darkness
fell
like
a
shutter
and
the
night
was
whole
a
faint
mutter
of
a
world
that
could
not
quite
leap
out
of
the
darkness
there
again
stood
a
sweep
of
pallor
for
the
land
dark
shapes
looming
a
range
of
clouds
hanging
overhead
the
world
was
a
ghostly
shadow
thrown
for
a
moment
upon
the
pure
darkness
which
returned
ever
whole
and
complete
and
the
mere
delirium
of
sickness
and
fever
went
on
inside
brain
opening
and
shutting
like
the
sometimes
convulsions
of
terror
from
something
with
great
eyes
that
stared
round
a
the
long
agony
of
the
march
and
the
sun
decomposing
his
the
pang
of
hate
for
the
captain
followed
by
a
pang
of
tenderness
and
ease
but
everything
was
distorted
born
of
an
ache
and
resolving
into
an
ache
in
the
morning
he
came
definitely
awake
then
his
brain
flamed
with
the
sole
horror
of
thirstiness
the
sun
was
on
his
face
the
dew
was
steaming
from
his
wet
clothes
like
one
possessed
he
got
up
there
straight
in
front
of
him
blue
and
cool
and
tender
the
mountains
ranged
across
the
pale
edge
of
the
morning
sky
he
wanted
wanted
them
wanted
to
leave
himself
and
be
identified
with
them
they
did
not
move
they
were
still
and
soft
with
white
gentle
markings
of
snow
he
stood
still
mad
with
suffering
his
hands
crisping
and
clutching
then
he
was
twisting
in
a
paroxysm
on
the
grass
he
lay
still
in
a
kind
of
dream
of
anguish
his
thirst
seemed
to
have
separated
itself
from
him
and
to
stand
apart
a
single
demand
then
the
pain
he
felt
was
another
single
self
then
there
was
the
clog
of
his
body
another
separate
thing
he
was
divided
among
all
kinds
of
separate
beings
there
was
some
strange
agonized
connection
between
them
but
they
were
drawing
further
apart
then
they
would
all
split
the
sun
drilling
down
on
him
was
drilling
through
the
bond
then
they
would
all
fall
fall
through
the
everlasting
lapse
of
space
then
again
his
consciousness
reasserted
itself
he
roused
on
to
his
elbow
and
stared
at
the
gleaming
mountains
there
they
ranked
all
still
and
wonderful
between
earth
and
heaven
he
stared
till
his
eyes
went
black
and
the
mountains
as
they
stood
in
their
beauty
so
clean
and
cool
seemed
to
have
it
that
which
was
lost
in
him
iv
when
the
soldiers
found
him
three
hours
later
he
was
lying
with
his
face
over
his
arm
his
black
hair
giving
off
heat
under
the
sun
but
he
was
still
alive
seeing
the
open
black
mouth
the
young
soldiers
dropped
him
in
horror
he
died
in
the
hospital
at
night
without
having
seen
again
the
doctors
saw
the
bruises
on
his
legs
behind
and
were
silent
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
lay
together
side
by
side
in
the
mortuary
the
one
white
and
slender
but
laid
rigidly
at
rest
the
other
looking
as
if
every
moment
it
must
rouse
into
life
again
so
young
and
unused
from
a
slumber
the
thorn
in
the
flesh
i
a
wind
was
running
so
that
occasionally
the
poplars
whitened
as
if
a
flame
flew
up
them
the
sky
was
broken
and
blue
among
moving
clouds
patches
of
sunshine
lay
on
the
level
fields
and
shadows
on
the
rye
and
the
vineyards
in
the
distance
very
blue
the
cathedral
bristled
against
the
sky
and
the
houses
of
the
city
of
metz
clustered
vaguely
below
like
a
hill
among
the
fields
by
the
lime
trees
stood
the
barracks
upon
bare
dry
ground
a
collection
of
huts
of
corrugated
iron
where
the
soldiers
nasturtiums
climbed
brilliantly
there
was
a
tract
of
vegetable
garden
at
the
side
with
the
soldiers
yellowish
lettuces
in
rows
and
at
the
back
the
big
hard
surrounded
by
a
wire
fence
at
this
time
in
the
afternoon
the
huts
were
deserted
all
the
beds
pushed
up
the
soldiers
were
lounging
about
under
the
lime
trees
waiting
for
the
call
to
drill
bachmann
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
shade
that
smelled
sickly
with
blossom
pale
green
wrecked
lime
flowers
were
scattered
on
the
ground
he
was
writing
his
weekly
post
card
to
his
mother
he
was
a
fair
long
limber
youth
good
looking
he
sat
very
still
indeed
trying
to
write
his
post
card
his
blue
uniform
sagging
on
him
as
he
sat
bent
over
the
card
disfigured
his
youthful
shape
his
sunburnt
hand
waited
motionless
for
the
words
to
come
dear
mother
all
he
had
written
then
he
scribbled
mechanically
many
thanks
for
your
letter
with
what
you
sent
everything
is
all
right
with
me
we
are
just
off
to
drill
on
the
here
he
broke
off
and
sat
suspended
oblivious
of
everything
held
in
some
definite
suspense
he
looked
again
at
the
card
but
he
could
write
no
more
out
of
the
knot
of
his
consciousness
no
word
would
come
he
signed
himself
and
looked
up
as
a
man
looks
to
see
if
anyone
has
noticed
him
in
his
privacy
there
was
a
strain
in
his
blue
eyes
and
a
pallor
about
his
mouth
where
the
young
fair
moustache
glistened
he
was
almost
girlish
in
his
good
looks
and
his
grace
but
he
had
something
of
military
consciousness
as
if
he
believed
in
the
discipline
for
himself
and
found
satisfaction
in
delivering
himself
to
his
duty
there
was
also
a
trace
of
youthful
swagger
and
about
his
mouth
and
his
limber
body
but
this
was
in
suppression
now
he
put
the
post
card
in
the
pocket
of
his
tunic
and
went
to
join
a
group
of
his
comrades
who
were
lounging
in
the
shade
laughing
and
talking
grossly
today
he
was
out
of
it
he
only
stood
near
to
them
for
the
warmth
of
the
association
in
his
own
consciousness
something
held
him
down
presently
they
were
summoned
to
ranks
the
sergeant
came
out
to
take
command
he
was
a
strongly
built
rather
heavy
man
of
forty
his
head
was
thrust
forward
sunk
a
little
between
his
powerful
shoulders
and
the
strong
jaw
was
pushed
out
aggressively
but
the
eyes
were
smouldering
the
face
hung
slack
and
sodden
with
drink
he
gave
his
orders
in
brutal
barking
shouts
and
the
little
company
moved
forward
out
of
the
yard
to
the
open
road
marching
rhythmically
raising
the
dust
bachmann
one
of
the
inner
file
of
four
deep
marched
in
the
airless
ranks
half
suffocated
with
heat
and
dust
and
enclosure
through
the
moving
of
his
comrades
bodies
he
could
see
the
small
vines
dusty
by
the
roadside
the
poppies
among
the
tares
fluttering
and
blown
to
pieces
the
distant
spaces
of
sky
and
fields
all
free
with
air
and
sunshine
but
he
was
bound
in
a
very
dark
enclosure
of
anxiety
within
himself
he
marched
with
his
usual
ease
being
healthy
and
well
adjusted
but
his
body
went
on
by
itself
his
spirit
was
clenched
apart
and
ever
the
few
soldiers
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
town
ever
the
consciousness
of
the
youth
became
more
gripped
and
separate
his
body
worked
by
a
kind
of
mechanical
intelligence
a
mere
presence
of
mind
they
diverged
from
the
high
road
and
passed
in
single
file
down
a
path
among
trees
all
was
silent
and
green
and
mysterious
with
shadow
of
foliage
and
long
green
undisturbed
grass
then
they
came
out
in
the
sunshine
on
a
moat
of
water
which
wound
silently
between
the
long
flowery
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
earthworks
that
rose
in
front
in
terraces
walled
smooth
on
the
face
but
all
soft
with
long
grass
at
the
top
marguerite
daisies
and
glimmered
white
and
gold
in
the
lush
grass
preserved
here
in
the
intense
peace
of
the
fortifications
thickets
of
trees
stood
round
about
occasionally
a
puff
of
mysterious
wind
made
the
flowers
and
the
long
grass
that
crested
the
earthworks
above
bow
and
shake
as
with
signals
of
oncoming
alarm
the
group
of
soldiers
stood
at
the
end
of
the
moat
in
their
light
blue
and
scarlet
uniforms
very
bright
the
sergeant
was
giving
them
instructions
and
his
shout
came
sharp
and
alarming
in
the
intense
untouched
stillness
of
the
place
they
listened
finding
it
difficult
to
make
the
effort
of
understanding
then
it
was
over
and
the
men
were
moving
to
make
preparations
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
the
ramparts
rose
smooth
and
clear
in
the
sun
sloping
slightly
back
along
the
summit
grass
grew
and
tall
daisies
stood
ledged
high
like
magic
against
the
dark
green
of
the
behind
the
noise
of
the
town
the
running
of
was
heard
distinctly
but
it
seemed
not
to
penetrate
this
still
place
the
water
of
the
moat
was
motionless
in
silence
the
practice
began
one
of
the
soldiers
took
a
scaling
ladder
and
passing
along
the
narrow
ledge
at
the
foot
of
the
earthworks
with
the
water
of
the
moat
just
behind
him
tried
to
get
a
fixture
on
the
slightly
sloping
there
he
stood
small
and
isolated
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
trying
to
get
his
ladder
settled
at
last
it
held
and
the
clumsy
groping
figure
in
the
baggy
blue
uniform
began
to
clamber
up
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
stood
and
watched
occasionally
the
sergeant
barked
a
command
slowly
the
clumsy
blue
figure
clambered
higher
up
the
bachmann
stood
with
his
bowels
turned
to
water
the
figure
of
the
climbing
soldier
scrambled
out
on
to
the
terrace
up
above
and
moved
blue
and
distinct
among
the
bright
green
grass
the
officer
shouted
from
below
the
soldier
tramped
along
fixed
the
ladder
in
another
spot
and
carefully
lowered
himself
on
to
the
rungs
bachmann
watched
the
blind
foot
groping
in
space
for
the
ladder
and
he
felt
the
world
fall
away
beneath
him
the
figure
of
the
soldier
clung
cringing
against
the
face
of
the
wall
cleaving
groping
downwards
like
some
unsure
insect
working
its
way
lower
and
lower
fearing
every
movement
at
last
sweating
and
with
a
strained
face
the
figure
had
landed
safely
and
turned
to
the
group
of
soldiers
but
still
it
had
a
stiffness
and
a
blank
mechanical
look
was
something
less
than
human
bachmann
stood
there
heavy
and
condemned
waiting
for
his
own
turn
and
betrayal
some
of
the
men
went
up
easily
enough
and
without
fear
that
only
showed
it
could
be
done
lightly
and
made
bachmann
case
more
bitter
if
only
he
could
do
it
lightly
like
that
his
turn
came
he
knew
intuitively
that
nobody
knew
his
condition
the
officer
just
saw
him
as
a
mechanical
thing
he
tried
to
keep
it
up
to
carry
it
through
on
the
face
of
things
his
inside
gripped
tight
as
yet
under
control
he
took
the
ladder
and
went
along
under
the
wall
he
placed
his
ladder
with
quick
success
and
wild
quivering
hope
possessed
him
then
blindly
he
began
to
climb
but
the
ladder
was
not
very
firm
and
at
every
hitch
a
great
sick
melting
feeling
took
hold
of
him
he
clung
on
fast
if
only
he
could
keep
that
grip
on
himself
he
would
get
through
he
knew
this
in
agony
what
he
could
not
understand
was
the
blind
gush
of
fear
that
came
with
great
force
whenever
the
ladder
swerved
and
which
almost
melted
his
belly
and
all
his
joints
and
left
him
powerless
if
once
it
melted
all
his
joints
and
his
belly
he
was
done
he
clung
desperately
to
himself
he
knew
the
fear
he
knew
what
it
did
when
it
came
he
knew
he
had
only
to
keep
a
firm
hold
he
knew
all
this
yet
when
the
ladder
swerved
and
his
foot
missed
there
was
the
great
blast
of
fear
blowing
on
his
heart
and
bowels
and
he
was
melting
weaker
and
weaker
in
a
horror
of
fear
and
lack
of
control
melting
to
fall
yet
he
groped
slowly
higher
and
higher
always
staring
upwards
with
desperate
face
and
always
conscious
of
the
space
below
but
all
of
him
body
and
soul
was
growing
hot
to
fusion
point
he
would
have
to
let
go
for
very
relief
sake
suddenly
his
heart
began
to
lurch
it
gave
a
great
sickly
swoop
rose
and
again
plunged
in
a
swoop
of
horror
he
lay
against
the
wall
inert
as
if
dead
inert
at
peace
save
for
one
deep
core
of
anxiety
which
knew
that
it
was
not
all
over
that
he
was
still
high
in
space
against
the
wall
but
the
chief
effort
of
will
was
gone
there
came
into
his
consciousness
a
small
foreign
sensation
he
woke
up
a
little
what
was
it
then
slowly
it
penetrated
him
his
water
had
run
down
his
leg
he
lay
there
clinging
still
with
shame
half
conscious
of
the
echo
of
the
sergeant
voice
thundering
from
below
he
waited
in
depths
of
shame
beginning
to
recover
himself
he
had
been
shamed
so
deeply
then
he
could
go
on
for
his
fear
for
himself
was
conquered
his
shame
was
known
and
published
he
must
go
on
slowly
he
began
to
grope
for
the
rung
above
when
a
great
shock
shook
through
him
his
wrists
were
grasped
from
above
he
was
being
hauled
out
of
himself
up
up
to
the
safe
ground
like
a
sack
he
was
dragged
over
the
edge
of
the
earthworks
by
the
large
hands
and
landed
there
on
his
knees
grovelling
in
the
grass
to
recover
command
of
himself
to
rise
up
on
his
feet
shame
blind
deep
shame
and
ignominy
overthrew
his
spirit
and
left
it
writhing
he
stood
there
shrunk
over
himself
trying
to
obliterate
himself
then
the
presence
of
the
officer
who
had
hauled
him
up
made
itself
felt
upon
him
he
heard
the
panting
of
the
elder
man
and
then
the
voice
came
down
on
his
veins
like
a
fierce
whip
he
shrank
in
tension
of
shame
put
up
your
front
shouted
the
enraged
sergeant
and
mechanically
the
soldier
obeyed
the
command
forced
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
the
sergeant
the
brutal
hanging
face
of
the
officer
violated
the
youth
he
hardened
himself
with
all
his
might
from
seeing
it
the
tearing
noise
of
the
sergeant
voice
continued
to
lacerate
his
body
suddenly
he
set
back
his
head
rigid
and
his
heart
leapt
to
burst
the
face
had
suddenly
thrust
itself
close
all
distorted
and
showing
the
teeth
the
eyes
smouldering
into
him
the
breath
of
the
barking
words
was
on
his
nose
and
mouth
he
stepped
aside
in
revulsion
with
a
scream
the
face
was
upon
him
again
he
raised
his
arm
involuntarily
in
a
shock
of
horror
went
through
him
as
he
felt
his
forearm
hit
the
face
of
the
officer
a
brutal
blow
the
latter
staggered
swerved
back
and
with
a
curious
cry
reeled
backwards
over
the
ramparts
his
hands
clutching
the
air
there
was
a
second
of
silence
then
a
crash
to
water
bachmann
rigid
looked
out
of
his
inner
silence
upon
the
scene
soldiers
were
running
you
better
clear
said
one
young
excited
voice
to
him
and
with
immediate
instinctive
decision
he
started
to
walk
away
from
the
spot
he
went
down
the
path
to
the
high
road
where
the
trams
ran
to
and
from
the
town
in
his
heart
was
a
sense
of
vindication
of
escape
he
was
leaving
it
all
the
military
world
the
shame
he
was
walking
away
from
it
officers
on
horseback
rode
sauntering
down
the
street
soldiers
passed
along
the
pavement
coming
to
the
bridge
bachmann
crossed
over
to
the
town
that
heaped
before
him
rising
from
the
flat
picturesque
french
houses
down
below
at
the
water
edge
up
a
jumble
of
roofs
and
chasms
of
streets
to
the
lovely
dark
cathedral
with
its
myriad
pinnacles
making
points
at
the
sky
he
felt
for
the
moment
quite
at
peace
relieved
from
a
great
strain
so
he
turned
along
by
the
river
to
the
public
gardens
beautiful
were
the
heaped
purple
lilac
trees
upon
the
green
grass
and
wonderful
the
walls
of
the
trees
lighted
like
an
altar
with
white
flowers
on
every
ledge
officers
went
by
elegant
and
all
coloured
women
and
girls
sauntered
in
the
chequered
shade
beautiful
it
was
he
walked
in
a
vision
free
ii
but
where
was
he
going
he
began
to
come
out
of
his
trance
of
delight
and
liberty
deep
within
him
he
felt
the
steady
burning
of
shame
in
the
flesh
as
yet
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
but
there
it
was
submerged
beneath
his
attention
the
raw
shame
it
behoved
him
to
be
intelligent
as
yet
he
dared
not
remember
what
he
had
done
he
only
knew
the
need
to
get
away
away
from
everything
he
had
been
in
contact
with
but
how
a
great
pang
of
fear
went
through
him
he
could
not
bear
his
shamed
flesh
to
be
put
again
between
the
hands
of
authority
already
the
hands
had
been
laid
upon
him
brutally
upon
his
nakedness
ripping
open
his
shame
and
making
him
maimed
crippled
in
his
own
control
fear
became
an
anguish
almost
blindly
he
was
turning
in
the
direction
of
the
barracks
he
could
not
take
the
responsibility
of
himself
he
must
give
himself
up
to
someone
then
his
heart
obstinate
in
hope
became
obsessed
with
the
idea
of
his
sweetheart
he
would
make
himself
her
responsibility
blenching
as
he
took
courage
he
mounted
the
small
tram
that
ran
out
of
the
town
in
the
direction
of
the
barracks
he
sat
motionless
and
composed
static
he
got
out
at
the
terminus
and
went
down
the
road
a
wind
was
still
running
he
could
hear
the
faint
whisper
of
the
rye
and
the
stronger
swish
as
a
sudden
gust
was
upon
it
no
one
was
about
feeling
detached
and
impersonal
he
went
down
a
between
the
low
vines
many
little
vine
trees
rose
up
in
spires
holding
out
tender
pink
shoots
waving
their
tendrils
he
saw
them
distinctly
and
wondered
over
them
in
a
field
a
little
way
off
men
and
women
were
taking
up
the
hay
the
stood
by
on
the
path
the
men
in
their
blue
shirts
the
women
with
white
cloths
over
their
heads
carried
hay
in
their
arms
to
the
cart
all
brilliant
and
distinct
upon
the
shorn
glowing
green
acres
he
felt
himself
looking
out
of
darkness
on
to
the
glamorous
brilliant
beauty
of
the
world
around
him
outside
him
the
baron
house
where
emilie
was
maidservant
stood
square
and
mellow
among
trees
and
garden
and
fields
it
was
an
old
french
grange
the
barracks
was
quite
near
bachmann
walked
drawn
by
a
single
purpose
towards
the
courtyard
he
entered
the
spacious
shadowy
place
the
dog
seeing
a
soldier
only
jumped
and
whined
for
greeting
the
pump
stood
peacefully
in
a
corner
under
a
lime
tree
in
the
shade
the
kitchen
door
was
open
he
hesitated
then
walked
in
speaking
shyly
and
smiling
involuntarily
the
two
women
started
but
with
pleasure
emilie
was
preparing
the
tray
for
afternoon
coffee
she
stood
beyond
the
table
drawn
up
startled
and
challenging
and
glad
she
had
the
proud
timid
eyes
of
some
wild
animal
some
proud
animal
her
black
hair
was
closely
banded
her
grey
eyes
watched
steadily
she
wore
a
peasant
dress
of
blue
cotton
sprigged
with
little
red
roses
that
buttoned
tight
over
her
strong
maiden
breasts
at
the
table
sat
another
young
woman
the
nursery
governess
who
was
picking
cherries
from
a
huge
heap
and
dropping
them
into
a
bowl
she
was
young
pretty
freckled
good
day
she
said
pleasantly
the
emilie
did
not
speak
the
flush
came
in
her
dark
cheek
she
still
stood
watching
between
fear
and
a
desire
to
escape
and
on
the
other
hand
joy
that
kept
her
in
his
presence
yes
he
said
bashful
and
strained
while
the
eyes
of
the
two
women
were
upon
him
i
got
myself
in
a
mess
this
what
asked
the
nursery
governess
dropping
her
hands
in
her
lap
emilie
stood
rigid
bachmann
could
not
raise
his
head
he
looked
sideways
at
the
glistening
ruddy
cherries
he
could
not
recover
the
normal
world
i
knocked
sergeant
huber
over
the
fortifications
down
into
the
moat
he
said
it
was
an
and
he
grasped
at
the
cherries
and
began
to
eat
them
unknowing
hearing
only
emilie
little
exclamation
you
knocked
him
over
the
fortifications
echoed
fräulein
hesse
in
horror
how
spitting
the
into
his
hand
mechanically
absorbedly
he
told
them
ach
exclaimed
emilie
sharply
and
how
did
you
get
here
asked
fräulein
hesse
i
ran
off
he
said
there
was
a
dead
silence
he
stood
putting
himself
at
the
mercy
of
the
women
there
came
a
hissing
from
the
stove
and
a
stronger
smell
of
coffee
emilie
turned
swiftly
away
he
saw
her
flat
straight
back
and
her
strong
loins
as
she
bent
over
the
stove
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
said
fräulein
hesse
aghast
i
do
know
he
said
grasping
at
more
cherries
he
had
come
to
an
end
you
better
go
to
the
barracks
she
said
we
get
the
herr
baron
to
come
and
see
about
emilie
was
swiftly
and
quietly
preparing
the
tray
she
picked
it
up
and
stood
with
the
glittering
china
and
silver
before
her
impassive
waiting
for
his
reply
bachmann
remained
with
his
head
dropped
pale
and
obstinate
he
could
not
bear
to
go
back
i
going
to
try
to
get
into
france
he
said
yes
but
they
catch
you
said
fräulein
hesse
emilie
watched
with
steady
watchful
grey
eyes
i
can
have
a
try
if
i
could
hide
till
tonight
he
said
both
women
knew
what
he
wanted
and
they
all
knew
it
was
no
good
emilie
picked
up
the
tray
and
went
out
bachmann
stood
with
his
head
dropped
within
himself
he
felt
the
dross
of
shame
and
incapacity
you
never
get
away
said
the
governess
i
can
try
he
said
today
he
could
not
put
himself
between
the
hands
of
the
military
let
them
do
as
they
liked
with
him
tomorrow
if
he
escaped
today
they
were
silent
he
ate
cherries
the
colour
flushed
bright
into
the
cheek
of
the
young
governess
emilie
returned
to
prepare
another
tray
he
could
hide
in
your
room
the
governess
said
to
her
the
girl
drew
herself
away
she
could
not
bear
the
intrusion
that
is
all
i
can
think
of
that
is
safe
from
the
children
said
fräulein
hesse
emilie
gave
no
answer
bachmann
stood
waiting
for
the
two
women
emilie
did
not
want
the
close
contact
with
him
you
could
sleep
with
me
fräulein
hesse
said
to
her
emilie
lifted
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
young
man
direct
clear
reserving
herself
do
you
want
that
she
asked
her
strong
virginity
proof
against
him
he
said
uncertainly
destroyed
by
shame
she
put
back
her
head
yes
she
murmured
to
herself
quickly
she
filled
the
tray
and
went
out
but
you
ca
walk
over
the
frontier
in
a
night
said
fräulein
hesse
i
can
cycle
he
said
emilie
returned
a
restraint
a
neutrality
in
her
bearing
i
see
if
it
all
right
said
the
governess
in
a
moment
or
two
bachmann
was
following
emilie
through
the
square
hall
where
hung
large
maps
on
the
walls
he
noticed
a
child
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
on
the
peg
and
it
reminded
him
of
emilie
walking
holding
the
hand
of
the
youngest
child
whilst
he
watched
sitting
under
the
lime
tree
already
this
was
a
long
way
off
that
was
a
sort
of
freedom
he
had
lost
changed
for
a
new
immediate
anxiety
they
went
quickly
fearfully
up
the
stairs
and
down
a
long
corridor
emilie
opened
her
door
and
he
entered
ashamed
into
her
room
i
must
go
down
she
murmured
and
she
departed
closing
the
door
softly
it
was
a
small
bare
neat
room
there
was
a
little
dish
for
a
picture
of
the
sacred
heart
a
crucifix
and
a
the
small
bed
lay
white
and
untouched
the
bowl
of
red
earth
stood
on
a
bare
table
there
was
a
little
mirror
and
a
small
chest
of
drawers
that
was
all
feeling
safe
in
sanctuary
he
went
to
the
window
looking
over
the
courtyard
at
the
shimmering
afternoon
country
he
was
going
to
leave
this
land
this
life
already
he
was
in
the
unknown
he
drew
away
into
the
room
the
curious
simplicity
and
severity
of
the
little
roman
catholic
bedroom
was
foreign
but
restoring
to
him
he
looked
at
the
crucifix
it
was
a
long
lean
peasant
christ
carved
by
a
peasant
in
the
black
forest
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
bachmann
saw
the
figure
as
a
human
thing
it
represented
a
man
hanging
there
in
helpless
torture
he
stared
at
it
closely
as
if
for
new
knowledge
within
his
own
flesh
burned
and
smouldered
the
restless
shame
he
could
not
gather
himself
together
there
was
a
gap
in
his
soul
the
shame
within
him
seemed
to
displace
his
strength
and
his
manhood
he
sat
down
on
his
chair
the
shame
the
roused
feeling
of
exposure
acted
on
his
brain
made
him
heavy
unutterably
heavy
mechanically
his
wits
all
gone
he
took
off
his
boots
his
belt
his
tunic
put
them
aside
and
lay
down
heavy
and
fell
into
a
kind
of
drugged
sleep
emilie
came
in
a
little
while
and
looked
at
him
but
he
was
sunk
in
sleep
she
saw
him
lying
there
inert
and
terribly
still
and
she
was
afraid
his
shirt
was
unfastened
at
the
throat
she
saw
his
pure
white
flesh
very
clean
and
beautiful
and
he
slept
inert
his
legs
in
the
blue
uniform
trousers
his
feet
in
the
coarse
stockings
lay
foreign
on
her
bed
she
went
away
iii
she
was
uneasy
perturbed
to
her
last
fibre
she
wanted
to
remain
clear
with
no
touch
on
her
a
wild
instinct
made
her
shrink
away
from
any
hands
which
might
be
laid
on
her
she
was
a
foundling
probably
of
some
gipsy
race
brought
up
in
a
roman
catholic
rescue
home
a
naïve
paganly
religious
being
she
was
attached
to
the
baroness
with
whom
she
had
served
for
seven
years
since
she
was
fourteen
she
came
into
contact
with
no
one
unless
it
were
with
ida
hesse
the
governess
ida
was
a
calculating
not
very
straightforward
flirt
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
country
doctor
having
gradually
come
into
connection
with
emilie
more
an
alliance
than
an
attachment
she
put
no
distinction
of
grade
between
the
two
of
them
they
worked
together
sang
together
walked
together
and
went
together
to
the
rooms
of
franz
brand
ida
sweetheart
there
the
three
talked
and
laughed
together
or
the
women
listened
to
franz
who
was
a
forester
playing
on
his
violin
in
all
this
alliance
there
was
no
personal
intimacy
between
the
young
women
emilie
was
naturally
secluded
in
herself
of
a
reserved
native
race
ida
used
her
as
a
kind
of
weight
to
balance
her
own
flighty
movement
but
the
quick
shifty
governess
occupied
always
in
her
dealings
with
admirers
did
all
she
could
to
move
the
violent
nature
of
emilie
towards
some
connection
with
men
but
the
dark
girl
primitive
yet
sensitive
to
a
high
degree
was
fiercely
virgin
her
blood
flamed
with
rage
when
the
common
soldiers
made
the
long
sucking
kissing
noise
behind
her
as
she
passed
she
hated
them
for
their
almost
jeering
offers
she
was
well
protected
by
the
baroness
and
her
contempt
of
the
common
men
in
general
was
ineffable
but
she
loved
the
baroness
and
she
revered
the
baron
and
she
was
at
her
ease
when
she
was
doing
something
for
the
service
of
a
gentleman
her
whole
nature
was
at
peace
in
the
service
of
real
masters
or
mistresses
for
her
a
gentleman
had
some
mystic
quality
that
left
her
free
and
proud
in
service
the
common
soldiers
were
brutes
merely
nothing
her
desire
was
to
serve
she
held
herself
aloof
when
on
sunday
afternoon
she
had
looked
through
the
windows
of
the
reichshalle
in
passing
and
had
seen
the
soldiers
dancing
with
the
common
girls
a
cold
revulsion
and
anger
had
possessed
her
she
could
not
bear
to
see
the
soldiers
taking
off
their
belts
and
pulling
open
their
tunics
dancing
with
their
shirts
showing
through
the
open
sagging
tunic
their
movements
gross
their
faces
transfigured
and
sweaty
their
coarse
hands
holding
their
coarse
girls
under
the
drawing
the
female
up
to
their
breasts
she
hated
to
see
them
clutched
breast
to
breast
the
legs
of
the
men
moving
grossly
in
the
dance
at
evening
when
she
had
been
in
the
garden
and
heard
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
the
sexual
inarticulate
cries
of
the
girls
in
the
embraces
of
the
soldiers
her
anger
had
been
too
much
for
her
and
she
had
cried
loud
and
cold
what
are
you
doing
there
in
the
hedge
she
would
have
had
them
whipped
but
bachmann
was
not
quite
a
common
soldier
fräulein
hesse
had
found
out
about
him
and
had
drawn
him
and
emilie
together
for
he
was
a
handsome
blond
youth
erect
and
walking
with
a
kind
of
pride
unconscious
yet
clear
moreover
he
came
of
a
rich
farming
stock
rich
for
many
generations
his
father
was
dead
his
mother
controlled
the
moneys
for
the
time
being
but
if
bachmann
wanted
a
hundred
pounds
at
any
moment
he
could
have
them
by
trade
he
with
one
of
his
brothers
was
a
the
family
had
the
farming
smithy
and
of
their
village
they
worked
because
that
was
the
form
of
life
they
knew
if
they
had
chosen
they
could
have
lived
independent
upon
their
means
in
this
way
he
was
a
gentleman
in
sensibility
though
his
intellect
was
not
developed
he
could
afford
to
pay
freely
for
things
he
had
moreover
his
native
fine
breeding
emilie
wavered
uncertainly
before
him
so
he
became
her
sweetheart
and
she
hungered
after
him
but
she
was
virgin
and
shy
and
needed
to
be
in
subjection
because
she
was
primitive
and
had
no
grasp
on
civilized
forms
of
living
nor
on
civilized
purposes
iv
at
six
came
the
inquiry
of
the
soldiers
had
anything
been
seen
of
bachmann
fräulein
hesse
answered
pleased
to
be
playing
a
rôle
no
i
not
seen
him
since
you
emilie
no
i
have
seen
him
said
emilie
and
her
awkwardness
was
construed
as
bashfulness
ida
hesse
stimulated
asked
questions
and
played
her
part
but
it
has
killed
sergeant
huber
she
cried
in
consternation
no
he
fell
into
the
water
but
it
gave
him
a
bad
shock
and
smashed
his
foot
on
the
side
of
the
moat
he
in
hospital
it
a
bad
for
emilie
implicated
and
captive
stood
looking
on
she
was
no
longer
free
working
with
all
this
regulated
system
which
she
could
not
understand
and
which
was
almost
to
her
she
was
put
out
of
her
place
bachmann
was
in
her
room
she
was
no
longer
the
faithful
in
service
serving
with
religious
surety
her
situation
was
intolerable
to
her
all
evening
long
the
burden
was
upon
her
she
could
not
live
the
children
must
be
fed
and
put
to
sleep
the
baron
and
baroness
were
going
out
she
must
give
them
light
refreshment
the
was
coming
in
to
supper
after
returning
with
the
carriage
and
all
the
while
she
had
the
insupportable
feeling
of
being
out
of
the
order
bewildered
the
control
of
her
life
should
come
from
those
above
her
and
she
should
move
within
that
control
but
now
she
was
out
of
it
uncontrolled
and
troubled
more
than
that
the
man
the
lover
bachmann
who
was
he
what
was
he
he
alone
of
all
men
contained
for
her
the
unknown
quantity
which
terrified
her
beyond
her
service
oh
she
had
wanted
him
as
a
distant
sweetheart
not
close
like
this
casting
her
out
of
her
world
when
the
baron
and
baroness
had
departed
and
the
young
had
gone
out
to
enjoy
himself
she
went
upstairs
to
bachmann
he
had
wakened
up
and
sat
dimly
in
the
room
out
in
the
open
he
heard
the
soldiers
his
comrades
singing
the
sentimental
songs
of
the
nightfall
the
drone
of
the
concertina
rising
in
accompaniment
wenn
ich
zu
mei
nem
kinde
geh
in
seinem
au
g
die
mutter
seh
but
he
himself
was
removed
from
it
now
only
the
sentimental
cry
of
young
unsatisfied
desire
in
the
soldiers
singing
penetrated
his
blood
and
stirred
him
subtly
he
let
his
head
hang
he
had
become
gradually
roused
and
he
waited
in
concentration
in
another
world
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
where
the
man
sat
alone
waiting
intensely
the
thrill
passed
through
her
she
died
in
terror
and
after
the
death
a
great
flame
gushed
up
obliterating
her
he
sat
in
trousers
and
shirt
on
the
side
of
the
bed
he
looked
up
as
she
came
in
and
she
shrank
from
his
face
she
could
not
bear
it
yet
she
entered
near
to
him
do
you
want
anything
to
eat
she
said
yes
he
answered
and
as
she
stood
in
the
twilight
of
the
room
with
him
he
could
only
hear
his
heart
beat
heavily
he
saw
her
apron
just
level
with
his
face
she
stood
silent
a
little
distance
off
as
if
she
would
be
there
for
ever
he
suffered
as
if
in
a
spell
she
waited
standing
motionless
and
looming
there
he
sat
rather
crouching
on
the
side
of
the
bed
a
second
will
in
him
was
powerful
and
dominating
she
drew
gradually
nearer
to
him
coming
up
slowly
as
if
unconscious
his
heart
beat
up
swiftly
he
was
going
to
move
as
she
came
quite
close
almost
invisibly
he
lifted
his
arms
and
put
them
round
her
waist
drawing
her
with
his
will
and
desire
he
buried
his
face
into
her
apron
into
the
terrible
softness
of
her
belly
and
he
was
a
flame
of
passion
intense
about
her
he
had
forgotten
shame
and
memory
were
gone
in
a
whole
furious
flame
of
passion
she
was
quite
helpless
her
hands
leapt
fluttered
and
closed
over
his
head
pressing
it
deeper
into
her
belly
vibrating
as
she
did
so
and
his
arms
tightened
on
her
his
hands
spread
over
her
loins
warm
as
flame
on
her
loveliness
it
was
intense
anguish
of
bliss
for
her
and
she
lost
consciousness
when
she
recovered
she
lay
translated
in
the
peace
of
satisfaction
it
was
what
she
had
had
no
inkling
of
never
known
could
be
she
was
strong
with
eternal
gratitude
and
he
was
there
with
her
instinctively
with
an
instinct
of
reverence
and
gratitude
her
arms
tightened
in
a
little
embrace
upon
him
who
held
her
thoroughly
embraced
and
he
was
restored
and
completed
close
to
her
that
little
twitching
momentary
clasp
of
acknowledgment
that
she
gave
him
in
her
satisfaction
roused
his
pride
unconquerable
they
loved
each
other
and
all
was
whole
she
loved
him
he
had
taken
her
she
was
given
to
him
it
was
right
he
was
given
to
her
and
they
were
one
complete
warm
with
a
glow
in
their
hearts
and
faces
they
rose
again
modest
but
transfigured
with
happiness
i
will
get
you
something
to
eat
she
said
and
in
joy
and
security
of
service
again
she
left
him
making
a
curious
little
homage
of
departure
he
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
escaped
liberated
wondering
and
happy
v
soon
she
came
again
with
the
tray
followed
by
fräulein
hesse
the
two
women
watched
him
eat
watched
the
pride
and
wonder
of
his
being
as
he
sat
there
blond
and
naïf
again
emilie
felt
rich
and
complete
ida
was
a
lesser
thing
than
herself
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
fräulein
hesse
jealous
i
must
get
away
he
said
but
words
had
no
meaning
for
him
what
did
it
matter
he
had
the
inner
satisfaction
and
liberty
but
you
want
a
bicycle
said
ida
hesse
yes
he
said
emilie
sat
silent
removed
and
yet
with
him
connected
with
him
in
passion
she
looked
from
this
talk
of
bicycles
and
escape
they
discussed
plans
but
in
two
of
them
was
the
one
will
that
bachmann
should
stay
with
emilie
ida
hesse
was
an
outsider
it
was
arranged
however
that
ida
lover
should
put
out
his
bicycle
leave
it
at
the
hut
where
he
sometimes
watched
bachmann
should
fetch
it
in
the
night
and
ride
into
france
the
hearts
of
all
three
beat
hot
in
suspense
driven
to
thought
they
sat
in
a
fire
of
agitation
then
bachmann
would
get
away
to
america
and
emilie
would
come
and
join
him
they
would
be
in
a
fine
land
then
the
tale
burned
up
again
emilie
and
ida
had
to
go
round
to
franz
brand
lodging
they
departed
with
slight
bachmann
sat
in
the
dark
hearing
the
bugle
for
retreat
sound
out
of
the
night
then
he
remembered
his
post
card
to
his
mother
he
slipped
out
after
emilie
gave
it
her
to
post
his
manner
was
careless
and
victorious
hers
shining
and
trustful
he
slipped
back
to
shelter
there
he
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
thinking
again
he
went
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
remembering
his
own
anguish
of
apprehension
because
he
had
known
he
could
not
climb
the
wall
without
fainting
with
fear
still
a
flush
of
shame
came
alight
in
him
at
the
memory
but
he
said
to
himself
what
does
it
matter
ca
help
it
well
then
i
ca
if
i
go
up
a
height
i
get
absolutely
weak
and
ca
help
again
memory
came
over
him
and
a
gush
of
shame
like
fire
but
he
sat
and
endured
it
it
had
to
be
endured
admitted
and
accepted
i
not
a
coward
for
all
that
he
continued
i
not
afraid
of
danger
if
i
made
that
way
that
heights
melt
me
and
make
me
let
go
my
water
was
torture
for
him
to
pluck
at
this
if
i
made
like
that
i
shall
have
to
abide
by
it
that
all
it
is
all
of
he
thought
of
emilie
and
was
satisfied
what
i
am
i
am
and
let
it
be
enough
he
thought
having
accepted
his
own
defect
he
sat
thinking
waiting
for
emilie
to
tell
her
she
came
at
length
saying
that
franz
could
not
arrange
about
his
bicycle
this
night
it
was
broken
bachmann
would
have
to
stay
over
another
day
they
were
both
happy
emilie
confused
before
ida
who
was
excited
and
prurient
came
again
to
the
young
man
she
was
stiff
and
dignified
with
an
agony
of
unusedness
but
he
took
her
between
his
hands
and
uncovered
her
and
enjoyed
almost
like
madness
her
helpless
virgin
body
that
suffered
so
strongly
and
that
took
its
joy
so
deeply
while
the
moisture
of
torment
and
modesty
was
still
in
her
eyes
she
clasped
him
closer
and
closer
to
the
victory
and
the
deep
satisfaction
of
both
of
them
and
they
slept
together
he
in
repose
still
satisfied
and
peaceful
and
she
lying
close
in
her
static
reality
vi
in
the
morning
when
the
bugle
sounded
from
the
barracks
they
rose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
she
loved
his
body
that
was
proud
and
blond
and
able
to
take
command
and
he
loved
her
body
that
was
soft
and
eternal
they
looked
at
the
faint
grey
vapour
of
summer
steaming
off
from
the
greenness
and
ripeness
of
the
fields
there
was
no
town
anywhere
their
look
ended
in
the
haze
of
the
summer
morning
their
bodies
rested
together
their
minds
tranquil
then
a
little
anxiety
stirred
in
both
of
them
from
the
sound
of
the
bugle
she
was
called
back
to
her
old
position
to
realize
the
world
of
authority
she
did
not
understand
but
had
wanted
to
serve
but
this
call
died
away
again
from
her
she
had
all
she
went
downstairs
to
her
work
curiously
changed
she
was
in
a
new
world
of
her
own
that
she
had
never
even
imagined
and
which
was
the
land
of
promise
for
all
that
in
this
she
moved
and
had
her
being
and
she
extended
it
to
her
duties
she
was
curiously
happy
and
absorbed
she
had
not
to
strive
out
of
herself
to
do
her
work
the
doing
came
from
within
her
without
call
or
command
it
was
a
delicious
outflow
like
sunshine
the
activity
that
flowed
from
her
and
put
her
tasks
to
rights
bachmann
sat
busily
thinking
he
would
have
to
get
all
his
plans
ready
he
must
write
to
his
mother
and
she
must
send
him
money
to
paris
he
would
go
to
paris
and
from
thence
quickly
to
america
it
had
to
be
done
he
must
make
all
preparations
the
dangerous
part
was
the
getting
into
france
he
thrilled
in
anticipation
during
the
day
he
would
need
a
of
the
trains
going
to
would
need
to
think
it
gave
him
delicious
pleasure
using
all
his
wits
it
seemed
such
an
adventure
this
one
day
and
he
would
escape
then
into
freedom
what
an
agony
of
need
he
had
for
absolute
imperious
freedom
he
had
won
to
his
own
being
in
himself
and
emilie
he
had
drawn
the
stigma
from
his
shame
he
was
beginning
to
be
himself
and
now
he
wanted
madly
to
be
free
to
go
on
a
home
his
work
and
absolute
freedom
to
move
and
to
be
in
her
with
her
this
was
his
passionate
desire
he
thought
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
living
an
hour
of
painful
intensity
suddenly
he
heard
voices
and
a
tramping
of
feet
his
heart
gave
a
great
leap
then
went
still
he
was
taken
he
had
known
all
along
a
complete
silence
filled
his
body
and
soul
a
silence
like
death
a
suspension
of
life
and
sound
he
stood
motionless
in
the
bedroom
in
perfect
suspension
emilie
was
busy
passing
swiftly
about
the
kitchen
preparing
the
children
breakfasts
when
she
heard
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
voice
of
the
baron
the
latter
had
come
in
from
the
garden
and
was
wearing
an
old
green
linen
suit
he
was
a
man
of
middle
stature
quick
finely
made
and
of
whimsical
charm
his
right
hand
had
been
shot
in
the
war
and
now
as
always
when
he
was
much
agitated
he
shook
it
down
at
his
side
as
if
it
hurt
he
was
talking
rapidly
to
a
young
stiff
two
private
soldiers
stood
bearishly
in
the
doorway
emilie
shocked
out
of
herself
stood
pale
and
erect
recoiling
yes
if
you
think
so
we
can
look
the
baron
was
hastily
and
irascibly
saying
emilie
he
said
turning
to
the
girl
did
you
put
a
post
card
to
the
mother
of
this
bachmann
in
the
box
last
evening
emilie
stood
erect
and
did
not
answer
yes
said
the
baron
sharply
yes
herr
baron
replied
emilie
neutral
the
baron
wounded
hand
shook
rapidly
in
exasperation
the
lieutenant
drew
himself
up
still
more
stiffly
he
was
right
and
do
you
know
anything
of
the
fellow
asked
the
baron
looking
at
her
with
his
blazing
eyes
the
girl
looked
back
at
him
steadily
dumb
but
her
whole
soul
naked
before
him
for
two
seconds
he
looked
at
her
in
silence
then
in
silence
ashamed
and
furious
he
turned
away
go
up
he
said
with
his
fierce
peremptory
command
to
the
young
officer
the
lieutenant
gave
his
order
in
military
cold
confidence
to
the
soldiers
they
all
tramped
across
the
hall
emilie
stood
motionless
her
life
suspended
the
baron
marched
swiftly
upstairs
and
down
the
corridor
the
lieutenant
and
the
common
soldiers
followed
the
baron
flung
open
the
door
of
emilie
room
and
looked
at
bachmann
who
stood
watching
standing
in
shirt
and
trousers
beside
the
bed
fronting
the
door
he
was
perfectly
still
his
eyes
met
the
furious
blazing
look
of
the
baron
the
latter
shook
his
wounded
hand
and
then
went
still
he
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
soldier
steadily
he
saw
the
same
naked
soul
exposed
as
if
he
looked
really
into
the
man
and
the
man
was
helpless
the
more
helpless
for
his
singular
nakedness
ha
he
exclaimed
impatiently
turning
to
the
approaching
lieutenant
the
latter
appeared
in
the
doorway
quickly
his
eyes
travelled
over
the
youth
he
recognized
him
as
his
object
he
gave
the
brief
command
to
dress
bachmann
turned
round
for
his
clothes
he
was
very
still
silent
in
himself
he
was
in
an
abstract
motionless
world
that
the
two
gentlemen
and
the
two
soldiers
stood
watching
him
he
scarcely
realized
they
could
not
see
him
soon
he
was
ready
he
stood
at
attention
but
only
the
shell
of
his
body
was
at
attention
a
curious
silence
a
blankness
like
something
eternal
possessed
him
he
remained
true
to
himself
the
lieutenant
gave
the
order
to
march
the
little
procession
went
down
the
stairs
with
careful
respectful
tread
and
passed
through
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
there
emilie
stood
with
her
face
uplifted
motionless
and
expressionless
bachmann
did
not
look
at
her
they
knew
each
other
they
were
themselves
then
the
little
file
of
men
passed
out
into
the
courtyard
the
baron
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
the
four
figures
in
uniform
pass
through
the
chequered
shadow
under
the
lime
trees
bachmann
was
walking
neutralized
as
if
he
were
not
there
the
lieutenant
went
brittle
and
long
the
two
soldiers
lumbered
beside
they
passed
out
into
the
sunny
morning
growing
smaller
going
towards
the
barracks
the
baron
turned
into
the
kitchen
emilie
was
cutting
bread
so
he
stayed
the
night
here
he
said
the
girl
looked
at
him
scarcely
seeing
she
was
too
much
herself
the
baron
saw
the
dark
naked
soul
of
her
body
in
her
unseeing
eyes
what
were
you
going
to
do
he
asked
he
was
going
to
america
she
replied
in
a
still
voice
pah
you
should
have
sent
him
straight
back
fired
the
baron
emilie
stood
at
his
bidding
untouched
he
done
for
now
he
said
but
he
could
not
bear
the
dark
deep
nakedness
of
her
eyes
that
scarcely
changed
under
this
suffering
nothing
but
a
fool
he
repeated
going
away
in
agitation
and
preparing
himself
for
what
he
could
do
daughters
of
the
vicar
i
mr
lindley
was
first
vicar
of
aldecross
the
cottages
of
this
tiny
hamlet
had
nestled
in
peace
since
their
beginning
and
the
country
folk
had
crossed
the
lanes
and
two
or
three
miles
to
the
parish
church
at
greymeed
on
the
bright
sunday
mornings
but
when
the
pits
were
sunk
blank
rows
of
dwellings
started
up
beside
the
high
roads
and
a
new
population
skimmed
from
the
floating
scum
of
workmen
was
filled
in
the
cottages
and
the
country
people
almost
obliterated
to
suit
the
convenience
of
these
new
a
church
must
be
built
at
aldecross
there
was
not
too
much
money
and
so
the
little
building
crouched
like
a
humped
mouse
with
two
little
turrets
at
the
west
corners
for
ears
in
the
fields
near
the
cottages
and
the
apple
trees
as
far
as
possible
from
the
dwellings
down
the
high
road
it
had
an
uncertain
timid
look
about
it
and
so
they
planted
ivy
to
hide
its
shrinking
newness
so
that
now
the
little
church
stands
buried
in
its
greenery
stranded
and
sleeping
among
the
fields
while
the
brick
houses
elbow
nearer
and
nearer
threatening
to
crush
it
down
it
is
already
obsolete
the
reverend
ernest
lindley
aged
and
newly
married
came
from
his
curacy
in
suffolk
to
take
charge
of
his
church
he
was
just
an
ordinary
young
man
who
had
been
to
cambridge
and
taken
orders
his
wife
was
a
young
woman
daughter
of
a
cambridgeshire
rector
her
father
had
spent
the
whole
of
his
thousand
a
year
so
that
mrs
lindley
had
nothing
of
her
own
thus
the
young
married
people
came
to
aldecross
to
live
on
a
stipend
of
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
and
to
keep
up
a
superior
position
they
were
not
very
well
received
by
the
new
raw
disaffected
population
of
colliers
being
accustomed
to
farm
labourers
mr
lindley
had
considered
himself
as
belonging
indisputably
to
the
upper
or
ordering
classes
he
had
to
be
humble
to
the
county
families
but
still
he
was
of
their
kind
whilst
the
common
people
were
something
different
he
had
no
doubts
of
himself
he
found
however
that
the
collier
population
refused
to
accept
this
arrangement
they
had
no
use
for
him
in
their
lives
and
they
told
him
so
callously
the
women
merely
said
they
were
throng
or
else
oh
it
no
good
you
coming
here
we
the
men
were
quite
so
long
as
he
did
not
touch
them
too
nigh
they
were
cheerfully
contemptuous
of
him
with
a
preconceived
contempt
he
was
powerless
against
at
last
passing
from
indignation
to
silent
resentment
even
if
he
dared
have
acknowledged
it
to
conscious
hatred
of
the
majority
of
his
flock
and
unconscious
hatred
of
himself
he
confined
his
activities
to
a
narrow
round
of
cottages
and
he
had
to
submit
he
had
no
particular
character
having
always
depended
on
his
position
in
society
to
give
him
position
among
men
now
he
was
so
poor
he
had
no
social
standing
even
among
the
common
vulgar
tradespeople
of
the
district
and
he
had
not
the
nature
nor
the
wish
to
make
his
society
agreeable
to
them
nor
the
strength
to
impose
himself
where
he
would
have
liked
to
be
recognized
he
dragged
on
pale
and
miserable
and
neutral
at
first
his
wife
raged
with
mortification
she
took
on
airs
and
used
a
high
hand
but
her
income
was
too
small
the
wrestling
with
bills
was
too
pitiful
she
only
met
with
general
callous
ridicule
when
she
tried
to
be
impressive
wounded
to
the
quick
of
her
pride
she
found
herself
isolated
in
an
indifferent
callous
population
she
raged
indoors
and
out
but
soon
she
learned
that
she
must
pay
too
heavily
for
her
outdoor
rages
and
then
she
only
raged
within
the
walls
of
the
rectory
there
her
feeling
was
so
strong
that
she
frightened
herself
she
saw
herself
hating
her
husband
and
she
knew
that
unless
she
were
careful
she
would
smash
her
form
of
life
and
bring
catastrophe
upon
him
and
upon
herself
so
in
very
fear
she
went
quiet
she
hid
bitter
and
beaten
by
fear
behind
the
only
shelter
she
had
in
the
world
her
gloomy
poor
parsonage
children
were
born
one
every
year
almost
mechanically
she
continued
to
perform
her
maternal
duty
which
was
forced
upon
her
gradually
broken
by
the
suppressing
of
her
violent
anger
and
misery
and
disgust
she
became
an
invalid
and
took
to
her
couch
the
children
grew
up
healthy
but
unwarmed
and
rather
rigid
their
father
and
mother
educated
them
at
home
made
them
very
proud
and
very
genteel
put
them
definitely
and
cruelly
in
the
upper
classes
apart
from
the
vulgar
around
them
so
they
lived
quite
isolated
they
were
and
had
that
curiously
clean
look
of
the
genteel
isolated
poor
gradually
mr
and
mrs
lindley
lost
all
hold
on
life
and
spent
their
hours
weeks
and
years
merely
haggling
to
make
ends
meet
and
bitterly
repressing
and
pruning
their
children
into
gentility
urging
them
to
ambition
weighting
them
with
duty
on
sunday
morning
the
whole
family
except
the
mother
went
down
the
lane
to
church
the
girls
in
skimpy
frocks
the
boys
in
black
coats
and
long
grey
unfitting
trousers
they
passed
by
their
father
parishioners
with
mute
clear
faces
childish
mouths
closed
in
pride
that
was
like
a
doom
to
them
and
childish
eyes
already
unseeing
miss
mary
the
eldest
was
the
leader
she
was
a
long
slim
thing
with
a
fine
profile
and
a
proud
pure
look
of
submission
to
a
high
fate
miss
louisa
the
second
was
short
and
plump
and
she
had
more
enemies
than
ideals
she
looked
after
the
lesser
children
miss
mary
after
the
elder
the
collier
children
watched
this
pale
distinguished
procession
of
the
family
pass
mutely
by
and
they
were
impressed
by
the
air
of
gentility
and
distance
they
made
mock
of
the
trousers
of
the
small
sons
they
felt
inferior
in
themselves
and
hate
stirred
their
hearts
in
her
time
miss
mary
received
as
governess
a
few
little
daughters
of
tradesmen
miss
louisa
managed
the
house
and
went
among
her
giving
lessons
on
the
piano
to
the
colliers
daughters
at
thirteen
shillings
for
lessons
ii
one
winter
morning
when
his
daughter
mary
was
about
twenty
years
old
mr
lindley
a
thin
unobtrusive
figure
in
his
black
overcoat
and
his
wideawake
went
down
into
aldecross
with
a
packet
of
white
papers
under
his
arm
he
was
delivering
the
parish
almanacs
a
rather
pale
neutral
man
of
middle
age
he
waited
while
the
train
thumped
over
the
going
up
to
the
pit
which
rattled
busily
just
along
the
line
a
man
hobbled
to
open
the
gate
mr
lindley
passed
on
just
at
his
left
hand
below
the
road
and
the
railway
was
the
red
roof
of
a
cottage
showing
through
the
bare
twigs
of
apple
trees
mr
lindley
passed
round
the
low
wall
and
descended
the
worn
steps
that
led
from
the
highway
down
to
the
cottage
which
crouched
darkly
and
quietly
away
below
the
rumble
of
passing
trains
and
the
clank
of
in
a
quiet
little
of
its
own
snowdrops
with
buds
were
hanging
very
still
under
the
bare
currant
bushes
the
clergyman
was
just
going
to
knock
when
he
heard
a
clinking
noise
and
turning
saw
through
the
open
door
of
a
black
shed
just
behind
him
an
elderly
woman
in
a
black
lace
cap
stooping
among
reddish
big
cans
pouring
a
very
bright
liquid
into
a
tundish
there
was
a
smell
of
paraffin
the
woman
put
down
her
can
took
the
tundish
and
laid
it
on
a
shelf
then
rose
with
a
tin
bottle
her
eyes
met
those
of
the
clergyman
oh
is
it
you
mr
she
said
in
a
complaining
tone
go
the
minister
entered
the
house
in
the
hot
kitchen
sat
a
big
elderly
man
with
a
great
grey
beard
taking
snuff
he
grunted
in
a
deep
muttering
voice
telling
the
minister
to
sit
down
and
then
took
no
more
notice
of
him
but
stared
vacantly
into
the
fire
mr
lindley
waited
the
woman
came
in
the
ribbons
of
her
black
lace
cap
or
bonnet
hanging
on
her
shawl
she
was
of
medium
stature
everything
about
her
was
tidy
she
went
up
a
step
out
of
the
kitchen
carrying
the
paraffin
tin
feet
were
heard
entering
the
room
up
the
step
it
was
a
little
haberdashery
shop
with
parcels
on
the
shelves
of
the
walls
a
big
sewing
machine
with
tailor
work
lying
round
it
in
the
open
space
the
woman
went
behind
the
counter
gave
the
child
who
had
entered
the
paraffin
bottle
and
took
from
her
a
jug
my
mother
says
shall
yer
put
it
down
said
the
child
and
she
was
gone
the
woman
wrote
in
a
book
then
came
into
the
kitchen
with
her
jug
the
husband
a
very
large
man
rose
and
brought
more
coal
to
the
already
hot
fire
he
moved
slowly
and
sluggishly
already
he
was
going
dead
being
a
tailor
his
large
form
had
become
an
encumbrance
to
him
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
great
dancer
and
boxer
now
he
was
taciturn
and
inert
the
minister
had
nothing
to
say
so
he
sought
for
his
phrases
but
john
durant
took
no
notice
existing
silent
and
dull
mrs
durant
spread
the
cloth
her
husband
poured
himself
beer
into
a
mug
and
began
to
smoke
and
drink
shall
you
have
some
he
growled
through
his
beard
at
the
clergyman
looking
slowly
from
the
man
to
the
jug
capable
of
this
one
idea
no
thank
you
replied
mr
lindley
though
he
would
have
liked
some
beer
he
must
set
the
example
in
a
drinking
parish
we
need
a
drop
to
keep
us
going
said
mrs
durant
she
had
rather
a
complaining
manner
the
clergyman
sat
on
uncomfortably
while
she
laid
the
table
for
the
ten
lunch
her
husband
drew
up
to
eat
she
remained
in
her
little
round
armchair
by
the
fire
she
was
a
woman
who
would
have
liked
to
be
easy
in
her
life
but
to
whose
lot
had
fallen
a
rough
and
turbulent
family
and
a
slothful
husband
who
did
not
care
what
became
of
himself
or
anybody
so
her
rather
square
face
was
peevish
she
had
that
air
of
having
been
compelled
all
her
life
to
serve
unwillingly
and
to
control
where
she
did
not
want
to
control
there
was
about
her
too
that
masterful
aplomb
of
a
woman
who
has
brought
up
and
ruled
her
sons
but
even
them
she
had
ruled
unwillingly
she
had
enjoyed
managing
her
little
riding
in
the
carrier
cart
to
nottingham
going
through
the
big
warehouses
to
buy
her
goods
but
the
fret
of
managing
her
sons
she
did
not
like
only
she
loved
her
youngest
boy
because
he
was
her
last
and
she
saw
herself
free
this
was
one
of
the
houses
the
clergyman
visited
occasionally
mrs
durant
as
part
of
her
regulation
had
brought
up
all
her
sons
in
the
church
not
that
she
had
any
religion
only
it
was
what
she
was
used
to
mr
durant
was
without
religion
he
read
the
fervently
evangelical
life
of
john
wesley
with
a
curious
pleasure
getting
from
it
a
satisfaction
as
from
the
warmth
of
the
fire
or
a
glass
of
brandy
but
he
cared
no
more
about
john
wesley
in
fact
than
about
john
milton
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
mrs
durant
took
her
chair
to
the
table
i
do
feel
like
eating
she
sighed
you
well
asked
the
clergyman
patronizing
it
is
that
she
sighed
she
sat
with
shut
straight
mouth
i
know
what
going
to
become
of
but
the
clergyman
had
ground
himself
down
so
long
that
he
could
not
easily
sympathize
have
you
any
trouble
he
asked
ay
have
i
any
trouble
cried
the
elderly
woman
i
shall
end
my
days
in
the
the
minister
waited
unmoved
what
could
she
know
of
poverty
in
her
little
house
of
plenty
i
hope
not
he
said
and
the
one
lad
as
i
wanted
to
keep
by
she
lamented
the
minister
listened
without
sympathy
quite
neutral
and
the
lad
as
would
have
been
a
support
to
my
old
age
what
is
going
to
become
of
us
she
said
the
clergyman
justly
did
not
believe
in
the
cry
of
poverty
but
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
son
has
anything
happened
to
alfred
he
asked
we
got
word
he
gone
for
a
queen
sailor
she
said
sharply
he
has
joined
the
navy
exclaimed
mr
lindley
i
think
he
could
scarcely
have
done
serve
his
queen
and
country
on
the
sea
he
is
wanted
to
serve
me
she
cried
and
i
wanted
my
lad
at
alfred
was
her
baby
her
last
whom
she
had
allowed
herself
the
luxury
of
spoiling
you
will
miss
him
said
mr
lindley
that
is
certain
but
this
is
no
regrettable
step
for
him
to
have
the
that
easy
for
you
to
say
mr
lindley
she
replied
tartly
do
you
think
i
want
my
lad
climbing
ropes
at
another
man
bidding
like
a
there
is
no
dishonour
surely
in
serving
in
the
navy
dishonour
this
dishonour
that
cried
the
angry
old
woman
he
goes
and
makes
a
slave
of
himself
and
he
rue
her
angry
scornful
impatience
nettled
the
clergyman
and
silenced
him
for
some
moments
i
do
not
see
he
retorted
at
last
white
at
the
gills
and
inadequate
that
the
queen
service
is
any
more
to
be
called
slavery
than
working
in
a
at
home
he
was
at
home
and
his
own
master
i
know
he
find
a
it
may
be
the
making
of
him
said
the
clergyman
it
will
take
him
away
from
bad
companionship
and
some
of
the
durants
sons
were
notorious
drinkers
and
alfred
was
not
quite
steady
and
why
indeed
should
he
have
his
glass
cried
the
mother
he
picks
no
man
pocket
to
pay
for
it
the
clergyman
stiffened
at
what
he
thought
was
an
allusion
to
his
own
profession
and
his
unpaid
bills
with
all
due
consideration
i
am
glad
to
hear
he
has
joined
the
navy
he
said
me
with
my
old
age
coming
on
and
his
father
working
very
little
thank
you
to
be
glad
about
something
else
besides
that
mr
the
woman
began
to
cry
her
husband
quite
impassive
finished
his
lunch
of
and
drank
some
beer
then
he
turned
to
the
fire
as
if
there
were
no
one
in
the
room
but
himself
i
shall
respect
all
men
who
serve
god
and
their
country
on
the
sea
mrs
durant
said
the
clergyman
stubbornly
that
is
very
well
when
they
not
your
sons
who
are
doing
the
dirty
work
it
makes
a
difference
she
replied
tartly
i
should
be
proud
if
one
of
my
sons
were
to
enter
the
not
all
of
us
made
the
minister
rose
he
put
down
a
large
folded
paper
i
brought
the
almanac
he
said
mrs
durant
unfolded
it
i
do
like
a
bit
of
colour
in
things
she
said
petulantly
the
clergyman
did
not
reply
there
that
envelope
for
the
organist
said
the
old
woman
and
rising
she
took
the
thing
from
the
mantelpiece
went
into
the
shop
and
returned
sealing
it
up
which
is
all
i
can
afford
she
said
mr
lindley
took
his
departure
in
his
pocket
the
envelope
containing
mrs
durant
offering
for
miss
louisa
services
he
went
from
door
to
door
delivering
the
almanacs
in
dull
routine
jaded
with
the
monotony
of
the
business
and
with
the
repeated
effort
of
greeting
people
he
felt
barren
and
rather
irritable
at
last
he
returned
home
in
the
was
a
small
fire
mrs
lindley
growing
very
stout
lay
on
her
couch
the
vicar
carved
the
cold
mutton
miss
louisa
short
and
plump
and
rather
flushed
came
in
from
the
kitchen
miss
mary
dark
with
a
beautiful
white
brow
and
grey
eyes
served
the
vegetables
the
children
chattered
a
little
but
not
exuberantly
the
very
air
seemed
starved
i
went
to
the
durants
said
the
vicar
as
he
served
out
small
portions
of
mutton
it
appears
alfred
has
run
away
to
join
the
do
him
good
came
the
rough
voice
of
the
invalid
miss
louisa
attending
to
the
youngest
child
looked
up
in
protest
why
has
he
done
that
asked
mary
low
musical
voice
he
wanted
some
excitement
i
suppose
said
the
vicar
shall
we
say
grace
the
children
were
arranged
all
bent
their
heads
grace
was
pronounced
at
the
last
word
every
face
was
being
raised
to
go
on
with
the
interesting
subject
he
just
done
the
right
thing
for
once
came
the
rather
deep
voice
of
the
mother
save
him
from
becoming
a
drunken
sot
like
the
rest
of
they
not
all
drunken
mama
said
miss
louisa
stubbornly
it
no
fault
of
their
upbringing
if
they
not
walter
durant
is
a
standing
as
i
told
mrs
durant
said
the
vicar
eating
hungrily
it
is
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
it
will
take
him
away
from
temptation
during
the
most
dangerous
years
of
his
old
is
twenty
said
miss
louisa
twenty
repeated
the
vicar
it
will
give
him
wholesome
discipline
and
set
before
him
some
sort
of
standard
of
duty
and
could
have
been
better
for
him
we
shall
miss
him
from
the
choir
said
miss
louisa
as
if
taking
opposite
sides
to
her
parents
that
is
as
it
may
be
said
the
vicar
i
prefer
to
know
he
is
safe
in
the
navy
than
running
the
risk
of
getting
into
bad
ways
was
he
getting
into
bad
ways
asked
the
stubborn
miss
louisa
you
know
louisa
he
was
quite
what
he
used
to
be
said
miss
mary
gently
and
steadily
miss
louisa
shut
her
rather
heavy
jaw
sulkily
she
wanted
to
deny
it
but
she
knew
it
was
true
for
her
he
had
been
a
laughing
warm
lad
with
something
kindly
and
something
rich
about
him
he
had
made
her
feel
warm
it
seemed
the
days
would
be
colder
since
he
had
gone
quite
the
best
thing
he
could
do
said
the
mother
with
emphasis
i
think
so
said
the
vicar
but
his
mother
was
almost
abusive
because
i
suggested
he
spoke
in
an
injured
tone
what
does
she
care
for
her
children
welfare
said
the
invalid
their
wages
is
all
her
i
suppose
she
wanted
him
at
home
with
her
said
miss
louisa
yes
she
the
expense
of
his
learning
to
be
a
drunkard
like
the
rest
of
them
retorted
her
mother
george
durant
does
drink
defended
her
daughter
because
he
got
burned
so
badly
when
he
was
the
that
frightened
him
the
navy
is
a
better
remedy
than
that
at
certainly
said
the
vicar
and
to
this
miss
louisa
agreed
yet
she
could
not
but
feel
angry
that
he
had
gone
away
for
so
many
years
she
herself
was
only
nineteen
iii
it
happened
when
miss
mary
was
years
old
that
mr
lindley
was
very
ill
the
family
was
exceedingly
poor
at
the
time
such
a
lot
of
money
was
needed
so
little
was
forthcoming
neither
miss
mary
nor
miss
louisa
had
suitors
what
chance
had
they
they
met
no
eligible
young
men
in
aldecross
and
what
they
earned
was
a
mere
drop
in
a
void
the
hearts
were
chilled
and
hardened
with
fear
of
this
perpetual
cold
penury
this
narrow
struggle
this
horrible
nothingness
of
their
lives
a
clergyman
had
to
be
found
for
the
church
work
it
so
happened
the
son
of
an
old
friend
of
mr
lindley
was
waiting
three
months
before
taking
up
his
duties
he
would
come
and
officiate
for
nothing
the
young
clergyman
was
keenly
expected
he
was
not
more
than
a
master
of
arts
of
oxford
had
written
his
thesis
on
roman
law
he
came
of
an
old
cambridgeshire
family
had
some
private
means
was
going
to
take
a
church
in
northamptonshire
with
a
good
stipend
and
was
not
married
mrs
lindley
incurred
new
debts
and
scarcely
regretted
her
husband
illness
but
when
mr
massy
came
there
was
a
shock
of
disappointment
in
the
house
they
had
expected
a
young
man
with
a
pipe
and
a
deep
voice
but
with
better
manners
than
sidney
the
eldest
of
the
lindleys
there
arrived
instead
a
small
chétif
man
scarcely
larger
than
a
boy
of
twelve
spectacled
timid
in
the
extreme
without
a
word
to
utter
at
first
yet
with
a
certain
inhuman
what
a
little
abortion
was
mrs
lindley
exclamation
to
herself
on
first
seeing
him
in
his
clerical
coat
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
days
she
was
profoundly
thankful
to
god
that
all
her
children
were
decent
specimens
he
had
not
normal
powers
of
perception
they
soon
saw
that
he
lacked
the
full
range
of
human
feelings
but
had
rather
a
strong
philosophical
mind
from
which
he
lived
his
body
was
almost
unthinkable
in
intellect
he
was
something
definite
the
conversation
at
once
took
a
balanced
abstract
tone
when
he
participated
there
was
no
spontaneous
exclamation
no
violent
assertion
or
expression
of
personal
conviction
but
all
cold
reasonable
assertion
this
was
very
hard
on
mrs
lindley
the
little
man
would
look
at
her
after
one
of
her
pronouncements
and
then
give
in
his
thin
voice
his
own
calculated
version
so
that
she
felt
as
if
she
were
tumbling
into
thin
air
through
a
hole
in
the
flimsy
floor
on
which
their
conversation
stood
it
was
she
who
felt
a
fool
soon
she
was
reduced
to
a
hardy
silence
still
at
the
back
of
her
mind
she
remembered
that
he
was
an
unattached
gentleman
who
would
shortly
have
an
income
altogether
of
six
or
seven
hundred
a
year
what
did
the
man
matter
if
there
were
pecuniary
ease
the
man
was
a
trifle
thrown
in
after
years
her
sentimentality
was
ground
away
and
only
the
millstone
of
poverty
mattered
to
her
so
she
supported
the
little
man
as
a
representative
of
a
decent
income
his
most
irritating
habit
was
that
of
a
sneering
little
giggle
all
on
his
own
which
came
when
he
perceived
or
related
some
illogical
absurdity
on
the
part
of
another
person
it
was
the
only
form
of
humour
he
had
stupidity
in
thinking
seemed
to
him
exquisitely
funny
but
any
novel
was
unintelligibly
meaningless
and
dull
and
to
an
irish
sort
of
humour
he
listened
curiously
examining
it
like
mathematics
or
else
simply
not
hearing
in
normal
human
relationship
he
was
not
there
quite
unable
to
take
part
in
simple
everyday
talk
he
padded
silently
round
the
house
or
sat
in
the
looking
nervously
from
side
to
side
always
apart
in
a
cold
rarefied
little
world
of
his
own
sometimes
he
made
an
ironic
remark
that
did
not
seem
humanly
relevant
or
he
gave
his
little
laugh
like
a
sneer
he
had
to
defend
himself
and
his
own
insufficiency
and
he
answered
questions
grudgingly
with
a
yes
or
no
because
he
did
not
see
their
import
and
was
nervous
it
seemed
to
miss
louisa
he
scarcely
distinguished
one
person
from
another
but
that
he
liked
to
be
near
her
or
to
miss
mary
for
some
sort
of
contact
which
stimulated
him
unknown
apart
from
all
this
he
was
the
most
admirable
workman
he
was
unremittingly
shy
but
perfect
in
his
sense
of
duty
as
far
as
he
could
conceive
christianity
he
was
a
perfect
christian
nothing
that
he
realized
he
could
do
for
anyone
did
he
leave
undone
although
he
was
so
incapable
of
coming
into
contact
with
another
being
that
he
could
not
proffer
help
now
he
attended
assiduously
to
the
sick
man
investigated
all
the
affairs
of
the
parish
or
the
church
which
mr
lindley
had
in
control
straightened
out
accounts
made
lists
of
the
sick
and
needy
padded
round
with
help
and
to
see
what
he
could
do
he
heard
of
mrs
lindley
anxiety
about
her
sons
and
began
to
investigate
means
of
sending
them
to
cambridge
his
kindness
almost
frightened
miss
mary
she
honoured
it
so
and
yet
she
shrank
from
it
for
in
it
all
mr
massy
seemed
to
have
no
sense
of
any
person
any
human
being
whom
he
was
helping
he
only
realized
a
kind
of
mathematical
working
out
solving
of
given
situations
a
calculated
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
accepted
the
christian
tenets
as
axioms
his
religion
consisted
in
what
his
scrupulous
abstract
mind
approved
of
seeing
his
acts
miss
mary
must
respect
and
honour
him
in
consequence
she
must
serve
him
to
this
she
had
to
force
herself
shuddering
and
yet
desirous
but
he
did
not
perceive
it
she
accompanied
him
on
his
visiting
in
the
parish
and
whilst
she
was
cold
with
admiration
for
him
often
she
was
touched
with
pity
for
the
little
padding
figure
with
bent
shoulders
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
in
his
overcoat
she
was
a
handsome
calm
girl
tall
with
a
beautiful
repose
her
clothes
were
poor
and
she
wore
a
black
silk
scarf
having
no
furs
but
she
was
a
lady
as
the
people
saw
her
walking
down
aldecross
beside
mr
massy
they
said
my
word
miss
mary
got
a
catch
did
ever
you
see
such
a
sickly
little
shrimp
she
knew
they
were
talking
so
and
it
made
her
heart
grow
hot
against
them
and
she
drew
herself
as
it
were
protectively
towards
the
little
man
beside
her
at
any
rate
she
could
see
and
give
honour
to
his
genuine
goodness
he
could
not
walk
fast
or
far
you
have
not
been
well
she
asked
in
her
dignified
way
i
have
an
internal
he
was
not
aware
of
her
slight
shudder
there
was
silence
whilst
she
bowed
to
recover
her
composure
to
resume
her
gentle
manner
towards
him
he
was
fond
of
miss
mary
she
had
made
it
a
rule
of
hospitality
that
he
should
always
be
escorted
by
herself
or
by
her
sister
on
his
visits
in
the
parish
which
were
not
many
but
some
mornings
she
was
engaged
then
miss
louisa
took
her
place
it
was
no
good
miss
louisa
trying
to
adopt
to
mr
massy
an
attitude
of
queenly
service
she
was
unable
to
regard
him
save
with
aversion
when
she
saw
him
from
behind
thin
and
looking
like
a
sickly
lad
of
thirteen
she
disliked
him
exceedingly
and
felt
a
desire
to
put
him
out
of
existence
and
yet
a
deeper
justice
in
mary
made
louisa
humble
before
her
sister
they
were
going
to
see
mr
durant
who
was
paralysed
and
not
expected
to
live
miss
louisa
was
crudely
ashamed
at
being
admitted
to
the
cottage
in
company
with
the
little
clergyman
mrs
durant
was
however
much
quieter
in
the
face
of
her
real
trouble
how
is
mr
durant
asked
louisa
he
is
no
we
do
expect
him
to
be
was
the
reply
the
little
clergyman
stood
looking
on
they
went
upstairs
the
three
stood
for
some
time
looking
at
the
bed
at
the
grey
head
of
the
old
man
on
the
pillow
the
grey
beard
over
the
sheet
miss
louisa
was
shocked
and
afraid
it
is
so
dreadful
she
said
with
a
shudder
it
is
how
i
always
thought
it
would
be
replied
mrs
durant
then
miss
louisa
was
afraid
of
her
the
two
women
were
uneasy
waiting
for
mr
massy
to
say
something
he
stood
small
and
bent
too
nervous
to
speak
has
he
any
understanding
he
asked
at
length
maybe
said
mrs
durant
can
you
hear
john
she
asked
loudly
the
dull
blue
eye
of
the
inert
man
looked
at
her
feebly
yes
he
understands
said
mrs
durant
to
mr
massy
except
for
the
dull
look
in
his
eyes
the
sick
man
lay
as
if
dead
the
three
stood
in
silence
miss
louisa
was
obstinate
but
under
the
load
of
unlivingness
it
was
mr
massy
who
kept
her
there
in
discipline
his
will
dominated
them
all
then
they
heard
a
sound
below
a
man
footsteps
and
a
man
voice
called
subduedly
are
you
upstairs
mother
mrs
durant
started
and
moved
to
the
door
but
already
a
quick
firm
step
was
running
up
the
stairs
i
a
bit
early
mother
a
troubled
voice
said
and
on
the
landing
they
saw
the
form
of
the
sailor
his
mother
came
and
clung
to
him
she
was
suddenly
aware
that
she
needed
something
to
hold
on
to
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
bent
over
her
kissing
her
he
not
gone
mother
he
asked
anxiously
struggling
to
control
his
voice
miss
louisa
looked
away
from
the
mother
and
son
who
stood
together
in
the
gloom
on
the
landing
she
could
not
bear
it
that
she
and
mr
massy
should
be
there
the
latter
stood
nervously
as
if
ill
at
ease
before
the
emotion
that
was
running
he
was
a
witness
nervous
unwilling
but
dispassionate
to
miss
louisa
hot
heart
it
seemed
all
all
wrong
that
they
should
be
there
mrs
durant
entered
the
bedroom
her
face
wet
there
miss
louisa
and
the
vicar
she
said
out
of
voice
and
quavering
her
son
and
slender
drew
himself
up
to
salute
but
miss
louisa
held
out
her
hand
then
she
saw
his
hazel
eyes
recognize
her
for
a
moment
and
his
small
white
teeth
showed
in
a
glimpse
of
the
greeting
she
used
to
love
she
was
covered
with
confusion
he
went
round
to
the
bed
his
boots
clicked
on
the
plaster
floor
he
bowed
his
head
with
dignity
how
are
you
dad
he
said
laying
his
hand
on
the
sheet
faltering
but
the
old
man
stared
fixedly
and
unseeing
the
son
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
few
minutes
then
slowly
recoiled
miss
louisa
saw
the
fine
outline
of
his
breast
under
the
sailor
blue
blouse
as
his
chest
began
to
heave
he
does
know
me
he
said
turning
to
his
mother
he
gradually
went
white
no
my
boy
cried
the
mother
pitiful
lifting
her
face
and
suddenly
she
put
her
face
against
his
shoulder
he
was
stooping
down
to
her
holding
her
against
him
and
she
cried
aloud
for
a
moment
or
two
miss
louisa
saw
his
sides
heaving
and
heard
the
sharp
hiss
of
his
breath
she
turned
away
tears
streaming
down
her
face
the
father
lay
inert
upon
the
white
bed
mr
massy
looked
queer
and
obliterated
so
little
now
that
the
sailor
with
his
sunburned
skin
was
in
the
room
he
stood
waiting
miss
louisa
wanted
to
die
she
wanted
to
have
done
she
dared
not
turn
round
again
to
look
shall
i
offer
a
prayer
came
the
frail
voice
of
the
clergyman
and
all
kneeled
down
miss
louisa
was
frightened
of
the
inert
man
upon
the
bed
then
she
felt
a
flash
of
fear
of
mr
massy
hearing
his
thin
detached
voice
and
then
calmed
she
looked
up
on
the
far
side
of
the
bed
were
the
heads
of
the
mother
and
son
the
one
in
the
black
lace
cap
with
the
small
white
nape
of
the
neck
beneath
the
other
with
brown
hair
too
close
and
wiry
to
allow
of
a
parting
and
neck
tanned
firm
bowed
as
if
unwillingly
the
great
grey
beard
of
the
old
man
did
not
move
the
prayer
continued
mr
massy
prayed
with
a
pure
lucidity
that
they
all
might
conform
to
the
higher
will
he
was
like
something
that
dominated
the
bowed
heads
something
dispassionate
that
governed
them
inexorably
miss
louisa
was
afraid
of
him
and
she
was
bound
during
the
course
of
the
prayer
to
have
a
little
reverence
for
him
it
was
like
a
foretaste
of
inexorable
cold
death
a
taste
of
pure
justice
that
evening
she
talked
to
mary
of
the
visit
her
heart
her
veins
were
possessed
by
the
thought
of
alfred
durant
as
he
held
his
mother
in
his
arms
then
the
break
in
his
voice
as
she
remembered
it
again
and
again
was
like
a
flame
through
her
and
she
wanted
to
see
his
face
more
distinctly
in
her
mind
ruddy
with
the
sun
and
his
eyes
kind
and
careless
strained
now
with
a
natural
fear
the
fine
nose
tanned
hard
by
the
sun
the
mouth
that
could
not
help
smiling
at
her
and
it
went
through
her
with
pride
to
think
of
his
figure
a
straight
fine
jet
of
life
he
is
a
handsome
lad
said
she
to
miss
mary
as
if
he
had
not
been
a
year
older
than
herself
underneath
was
the
deeper
dread
almost
hatred
of
the
inhuman
being
of
mr
massy
she
felt
she
must
protect
herself
and
alfred
from
him
when
i
felt
mr
massy
there
she
said
i
almost
hated
him
what
right
had
he
to
be
there
surely
he
had
all
right
said
miss
mary
after
a
pause
he
is
really
a
he
seems
to
me
nearly
an
imbecile
said
miss
louisa
miss
mary
quiet
and
beautiful
was
silent
for
a
moment
oh
no
she
said
not
well
reminds
me
of
a
six
months
a
five
if
he
did
have
time
to
get
developed
enough
before
he
was
yes
said
miss
mary
slowly
there
is
something
lacking
but
there
is
something
wonderful
in
him
and
he
is
really
yes
said
miss
louisa
it
does
seem
right
that
he
should
be
what
right
has
that
to
be
called
goodness
but
it
is
goodness
persisted
mary
then
she
added
with
a
laugh
and
come
you
would
deny
that
as
there
was
a
doggedness
in
her
voice
she
went
about
very
quietly
in
her
soul
she
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
she
knew
that
mr
massy
was
stronger
than
she
and
that
she
must
submit
to
what
he
was
her
physical
self
was
prouder
stronger
than
he
her
physical
self
disliked
and
despised
him
but
she
was
in
the
grip
of
his
moral
mental
being
and
she
felt
the
days
allotted
out
to
her
and
her
family
watched
iv
a
few
days
after
old
mr
durant
died
miss
louisa
saw
alfred
once
more
but
he
was
stiff
before
her
now
treating
her
not
like
a
person
but
as
if
she
were
some
sort
of
will
in
command
and
he
a
separate
distinct
will
waiting
in
front
of
her
she
had
never
felt
such
utter
separation
from
anyone
it
puzzled
her
and
frightened
her
what
had
become
of
him
and
she
hated
the
military
was
antagonistic
to
it
now
he
was
not
himself
he
was
the
will
which
obeys
set
over
against
the
will
which
commands
she
hesitated
over
accepting
this
he
had
put
himself
out
of
her
range
he
had
ranked
himself
inferior
subordinate
to
her
and
that
was
how
he
would
get
away
from
her
that
was
how
he
would
avoid
all
connection
with
her
by
fronting
her
impersonally
from
the
opposite
camp
by
taking
up
the
abstract
position
of
an
inferior
she
went
brooding
steadily
and
sullenly
over
this
brooding
and
brooding
her
fierce
obstinate
heart
could
not
give
way
it
clung
to
its
own
rights
sometimes
she
dismissed
him
why
should
he
inferior
trouble
her
then
she
relapsed
to
him
and
almost
hated
him
it
was
his
way
of
getting
out
of
it
she
felt
the
cowardice
of
it
his
calmly
placing
her
in
a
superior
class
and
placing
himself
inaccessibly
apart
in
an
inferior
as
if
she
the
sensient
woman
who
was
fond
of
him
did
not
count
but
she
was
not
going
to
submit
dogged
in
her
heart
she
held
on
to
him
v
in
six
months
time
miss
mary
had
married
mr
massy
there
had
been
no
nobody
had
made
any
remark
but
everybody
was
tense
and
callous
with
expectation
when
one
day
mr
massy
asked
for
mary
hand
mr
lindley
started
and
trembled
from
the
thin
abstract
voice
of
the
little
man
mr
massy
was
very
nervous
but
so
curiously
absolute
i
shall
be
very
glad
said
the
vicar
but
of
course
the
decision
lies
with
mary
and
his
still
feeble
hand
shook
as
he
moved
a
bible
on
his
desk
the
small
man
keeping
fixedly
to
his
idea
padded
out
of
the
room
to
find
miss
mary
he
sat
a
long
time
by
her
while
she
made
some
conversation
before
he
had
readiness
to
speak
she
was
afraid
of
what
was
coming
and
sat
stiff
in
apprehension
she
felt
as
if
her
body
would
rise
and
fling
him
aside
but
her
spirit
quivered
and
waited
almost
in
expectation
she
waited
almost
wanting
him
and
then
she
knew
he
would
speak
i
have
already
asked
mr
lindley
said
the
clergyman
while
suddenly
she
looked
with
aversion
at
his
little
knees
if
he
would
consent
to
my
he
was
aware
of
his
own
disadvantage
but
his
will
was
set
she
went
cold
as
she
sat
and
impervious
almost
as
if
she
had
become
stone
he
waited
a
moment
nervously
he
would
not
persuade
her
he
himself
never
even
heard
persuasion
but
pursued
his
own
course
he
looked
at
her
sure
of
himself
unsure
of
her
and
said
will
you
become
my
wife
mary
still
her
heart
was
hard
and
cold
she
sat
proudly
i
should
like
to
speak
to
mama
first
she
said
very
well
replied
mr
massy
and
in
a
moment
he
padded
away
mary
went
to
her
mother
she
was
cold
and
reserved
mr
massy
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
mama
she
said
mrs
lindley
went
on
staring
at
her
book
she
was
cramped
in
her
feeling
well
and
what
did
you
say
they
were
both
keeping
calm
and
cold
i
said
i
would
speak
to
you
before
answering
this
was
equivalent
to
a
question
mrs
lindley
did
not
want
to
reply
to
it
she
shifted
her
heavy
form
irritably
on
the
couch
miss
mary
sat
calm
and
straight
with
closed
mouth
your
father
thinks
it
would
not
be
a
bad
match
said
the
mother
as
if
casually
nothing
more
was
said
everybody
remained
cold
and
miss
mary
did
not
speak
to
miss
louisa
the
reverend
ernest
lindley
kept
out
of
sight
at
evening
miss
mary
accepted
mr
massy
yes
i
will
marry
you
she
said
with
even
a
little
movement
of
tenderness
towards
him
he
was
embarrassed
but
satisfied
she
could
see
him
making
some
movement
towards
her
could
feel
the
male
in
him
something
cold
and
triumphant
asserting
itself
she
sat
rigid
and
waited
when
miss
louisa
knew
she
was
silent
with
bitter
anger
against
everybody
even
against
mary
she
felt
her
faith
wounded
did
the
real
things
to
her
not
matter
after
all
she
wanted
to
get
away
she
thought
of
mr
massy
he
had
some
curious
power
some
unanswerable
right
he
was
a
will
that
they
could
not
a
flush
started
in
her
if
he
had
come
to
her
she
would
have
flipped
him
out
of
the
room
he
was
never
going
to
touch
her
and
she
was
glad
she
was
glad
that
her
blood
would
rise
and
exterminate
the
little
man
if
he
came
too
near
to
her
no
matter
how
her
judgment
was
paralysed
by
him
no
matter
how
he
moved
in
abstract
goodness
she
thought
she
was
perverse
to
be
glad
but
glad
she
was
i
would
just
flip
him
out
of
the
room
she
said
and
she
derived
great
satisfaction
from
the
open
statement
nevertheless
perhaps
she
ought
still
to
feel
that
mary
on
her
plane
was
a
higher
being
than
herself
but
then
mary
was
mary
and
she
was
louisa
and
that
also
was
inalterable
mary
in
marrying
him
tried
to
become
a
pure
reason
such
as
he
was
without
feeling
or
impulse
she
shut
herself
up
she
shut
herself
rigid
against
the
agonies
of
shame
and
the
terror
of
violation
which
came
at
first
she
would
not
feel
and
she
would
not
feel
she
was
a
pure
will
acquiescing
to
him
she
elected
a
certain
kind
of
fate
she
would
be
good
and
purely
just
she
would
live
in
a
higher
freedom
than
she
had
ever
known
she
would
be
free
of
mundane
care
she
was
a
pure
will
towards
right
she
had
sold
herself
but
she
had
a
new
freedom
she
had
got
rid
of
her
body
she
had
sold
a
lower
thing
her
body
for
a
higher
thing
her
freedom
from
material
things
she
considered
that
she
paid
for
all
she
got
from
her
husband
so
in
a
kind
of
independence
she
moved
proud
and
free
she
had
paid
with
her
body
that
was
henceforward
out
of
consideration
she
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
she
had
bought
her
position
in
the
henceforth
was
taken
for
granted
there
remained
only
the
direction
of
her
activity
towards
charity
and
living
she
could
scarcely
bear
other
people
to
be
present
with
her
and
her
husband
her
private
life
was
her
shame
but
then
she
could
keep
it
hidden
she
lived
almost
isolated
in
the
rectory
of
the
tiny
village
miles
from
the
railway
she
suffered
as
if
it
were
an
insult
to
her
own
flesh
seeing
the
repulsion
which
some
people
felt
for
her
husband
or
the
special
manner
they
had
of
treating
him
as
if
he
were
a
case
but
most
people
were
uneasy
before
him
which
restored
her
pride
if
she
had
let
herself
she
would
have
hated
him
hated
his
padding
round
the
house
his
thin
voice
devoid
of
human
understanding
his
bent
little
shoulders
and
rather
incomplete
face
that
reminded
her
of
an
abortion
but
rigorously
she
kept
to
her
position
she
took
care
of
him
and
was
just
to
him
there
was
also
a
deep
craven
fear
of
him
something
there
was
not
much
fault
to
be
found
with
his
behaviour
he
was
scrupulously
just
and
kind
according
to
his
lights
but
the
male
in
him
was
cold
and
and
utterly
domineering
weak
insufficient
little
thing
as
he
was
she
had
not
expected
this
of
him
it
was
something
in
the
bargain
she
had
not
understood
it
made
her
hold
her
head
to
keep
still
she
knew
vaguely
that
she
was
murdering
herself
after
all
her
body
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
get
rid
of
and
this
manner
of
disposing
of
sometimes
she
felt
she
must
rise
and
bring
about
death
lift
her
hand
for
utter
denial
of
everything
by
a
general
destruction
he
was
almost
unaware
of
the
conditions
about
him
he
did
not
fuss
in
the
domestic
way
she
did
as
she
liked
in
the
house
indeed
she
was
a
great
deal
free
of
him
he
would
sit
obliterated
for
hours
he
was
kind
and
almost
anxiously
considerate
but
when
he
considered
he
was
right
his
will
was
just
blindly
male
like
a
cold
machine
and
on
most
points
he
was
logically
right
or
he
had
with
him
the
right
of
the
creed
they
both
accepted
it
was
so
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
go
against
then
she
found
herself
with
child
and
felt
for
the
first
time
horror
afraid
before
god
and
man
this
also
she
had
to
go
was
the
right
when
the
child
arrived
it
was
a
bonny
healthy
lad
her
heart
hurt
in
her
body
as
she
took
the
baby
between
her
hands
the
flesh
that
was
trampled
and
silent
in
her
must
speak
again
in
the
boy
after
all
she
had
to
was
not
so
simple
after
all
nothing
was
finished
completely
she
looked
and
looked
at
the
baby
and
almost
hated
it
and
suffered
an
anguish
of
love
for
it
she
hated
it
because
it
made
her
live
again
in
the
flesh
when
she
could
not
live
in
the
flesh
she
could
not
she
wanted
to
trample
her
flesh
down
down
extinct
to
live
in
the
mind
and
now
there
was
this
child
it
was
too
cruel
too
racking
for
she
must
love
the
child
her
purpose
was
broken
in
two
again
she
had
to
become
amorphous
purposeless
without
real
being
as
a
mother
she
was
a
fragmentary
ignoble
thing
mr
massy
blind
to
everything
else
in
the
way
of
human
feeling
became
obsessed
by
the
idea
of
his
child
when
it
arrived
suddenly
it
filled
the
whole
world
of
feeling
for
him
it
was
his
obsession
his
terror
was
for
its
safety
and
it
was
something
new
as
if
he
himself
had
been
born
a
naked
infant
conscious
of
his
own
exposure
and
full
of
apprehension
he
who
had
never
been
aware
of
anyone
else
all
his
life
now
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
child
not
that
he
ever
played
with
it
or
kissed
it
or
tended
it
he
did
nothing
for
it
but
it
dominated
him
it
filled
and
at
the
same
time
emptied
his
mind
the
world
was
all
baby
for
him
this
his
wife
must
also
bear
his
question
what
is
the
reason
that
he
cries
reminder
at
the
first
sound
mary
that
is
the
child
restlessness
if
the
were
five
minutes
past
she
had
bargained
for
she
must
stand
by
her
bargain
vi
miss
louisa
at
home
in
the
dingy
vicarage
had
suffered
a
great
deal
over
her
sister
wedding
having
once
begun
to
cry
out
against
it
during
the
engagement
she
had
been
silenced
by
mary
quiet
i
agree
with
you
about
him
louisa
i
want
to
marry
then
miss
louisa
had
been
angry
deep
in
her
heart
and
therefore
silent
this
dangerous
state
started
the
change
in
her
her
own
revulsion
made
her
recoil
from
the
hitherto
undoubted
mary
i
beg
the
streets
barefoot
first
said
miss
louisa
thinking
of
mr
massy
but
evidently
mary
could
perform
a
different
heroism
so
she
louisa
the
practical
suddenly
felt
that
mary
her
ideal
was
questionable
after
all
how
could
she
be
can
not
be
dirty
in
act
and
spiritual
in
being
louisa
distrusted
mary
high
spirituality
it
was
no
longer
genuine
for
her
and
if
mary
were
spiritual
and
misguided
why
did
not
her
father
protect
her
because
of
the
money
he
disliked
the
whole
affair
but
he
backed
away
because
of
the
money
and
the
mother
frankly
did
not
care
her
daughters
could
do
as
they
liked
her
pronouncement
whatever
happens
to
him
mary
is
safe
for
life
evidently
and
shallowly
a
calculation
incensed
louisa
i
rather
be
safe
in
the
workhouse
she
cried
your
father
will
see
to
that
replied
her
mother
brutally
this
speech
in
its
indirectness
so
injured
miss
louisa
that
she
hated
her
mother
deep
deep
in
her
heart
and
almost
hated
herself
it
was
a
long
time
resolving
itself
out
this
hate
but
it
worked
and
worked
and
at
last
the
young
woman
said
they
are
are
all
wrong
they
have
ground
out
their
souls
for
what
is
worth
anything
and
there
is
a
grain
of
love
in
them
anywhere
and
i
will
have
love
they
want
us
to
deny
it
they
never
found
it
so
they
want
to
say
it
does
exist
but
i
will
have
it
i
will
is
my
birthright
i
will
love
the
man
i
is
all
i
care
so
miss
louisa
stood
isolated
from
everybody
she
and
mary
had
parted
over
mr
massy
in
louisa
eyes
mary
was
degraded
married
to
mr
massy
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
lofty
spiritual
sister
degraded
in
the
body
like
this
mary
was
wrong
wrong
wrong
she
was
not
superior
she
was
flawed
incomplete
the
two
sisters
stood
apart
they
still
loved
each
other
they
would
love
each
other
as
long
as
they
lived
but
they
had
parted
ways
a
new
solitariness
came
over
the
obstinate
louisa
and
her
heavy
jaw
set
stubbornly
she
was
going
on
her
own
way
but
which
way
she
was
quite
alone
with
a
blank
world
before
her
how
could
she
be
said
to
have
any
way
yet
she
had
her
fixed
will
to
love
to
have
the
man
she
loved
vii
when
her
boy
was
three
years
old
mary
had
another
baby
a
girl
the
three
years
had
gone
by
monotonously
they
might
have
been
an
eternity
they
might
have
been
brief
as
a
sleep
she
did
not
know
only
there
was
always
a
weight
on
top
of
her
something
that
pressed
down
her
life
the
only
thing
that
had
happened
was
that
mr
massy
had
had
an
operation
he
was
always
exceedingly
fragile
his
wife
had
soon
learned
to
attend
to
him
mechanically
as
part
of
her
duty
but
this
third
year
after
the
baby
girl
had
been
born
mary
felt
oppressed
and
depressed
christmas
drew
near
the
gloomy
unleavened
christmas
of
the
rectory
where
all
the
days
were
of
the
same
dark
fabric
and
mary
was
afraid
it
was
as
if
the
darkness
were
coming
upon
her
edward
i
should
like
to
go
home
for
christmas
she
said
and
a
certain
terror
filled
her
as
she
spoke
but
you
ca
leave
baby
said
her
husband
blinking
we
can
all
he
thought
and
stared
in
his
collective
fashion
why
do
you
wish
to
go
he
asked
because
i
need
a
change
a
change
would
do
me
good
and
it
would
be
good
for
the
he
heard
the
will
in
his
wife
voice
and
was
at
a
loss
her
language
was
unintelligible
to
him
and
while
she
was
breeding
either
about
to
have
a
child
or
nursing
he
regarded
her
as
a
special
sort
of
being
would
it
hurt
baby
to
take
her
by
the
train
he
said
no
replied
the
mother
why
should
it
they
went
when
they
were
in
the
train
it
began
to
snow
from
the
window
of
his
carriage
the
little
clergyman
watched
the
big
flakes
sweep
by
like
a
blind
drawn
across
the
country
he
was
obsessed
by
thought
of
the
baby
and
afraid
of
the
draughts
of
the
carriage
sit
right
in
the
corner
he
said
to
his
wife
and
hold
baby
close
she
moved
at
his
bidding
and
stared
out
of
the
window
his
eternal
presence
was
like
an
iron
weight
on
her
brain
but
she
was
going
partially
to
escape
for
a
few
days
sit
on
the
other
side
jack
said
the
father
it
is
less
draughty
come
to
this
he
watched
the
boy
in
anxiety
but
his
children
were
the
only
beings
in
the
world
who
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
him
look
mother
look
cried
the
boy
they
fly
right
in
my
face
meant
the
snowflakes
come
into
this
corner
repeated
his
father
out
of
another
world
he
jumped
on
this
one
back
mother
an
they
riding
to
the
bottom
cried
the
boy
jumping
with
glee
tell
him
to
come
on
this
side
the
little
man
bade
his
wife
jack
kneel
on
this
cushion
said
the
mother
putting
her
white
hand
on
the
place
the
boy
slid
over
in
silence
to
the
place
she
indicated
waited
still
for
a
moment
then
almost
deliberately
stridently
cried
look
at
all
those
in
the
corner
mother
making
a
heap
and
he
pointed
to
the
cluster
of
snowflakes
with
finger
pressed
dramatically
on
the
pane
and
he
turned
to
his
mother
a
bit
ostentatiously
all
in
a
heap
she
said
he
had
seen
her
face
and
had
her
response
and
he
was
somewhat
assured
vaguely
uneasy
he
was
reassured
if
he
could
win
her
attention
they
arrived
at
the
vicarage
at
two
not
having
had
lunch
how
are
you
edward
said
mr
lindley
trying
on
his
side
to
be
fatherly
but
he
was
always
in
a
false
position
with
his
frustrated
before
him
therefore
as
much
as
possible
he
shut
his
eyes
and
ears
to
him
the
vicar
was
looking
thin
and
pale
and
he
had
gone
quite
grey
he
was
however
still
haughty
but
since
the
of
his
children
it
was
a
brittle
haughtiness
that
might
break
at
any
moment
and
leave
the
vicar
only
an
impoverished
pitiable
figure
mrs
lindley
took
all
the
notice
of
her
daughter
and
of
the
children
she
ignored
her
miss
louisa
was
clucking
and
laughing
and
rejoicing
over
the
baby
mr
massy
stood
aside
a
bent
persistent
little
figure
oh
a
pretty
little
pretty
oh
a
cold
little
pretty
come
in
a
miss
louisa
was
cooing
to
the
infant
crouching
on
the
hearthrug
opening
the
white
woollen
wraps
and
exposing
the
child
to
the
fireglow
mary
said
the
little
clergyman
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
give
baby
a
warm
bath
she
may
take
a
i
think
it
is
not
necessary
said
the
mother
coming
and
closing
her
hand
judiciously
over
the
rosy
feet
and
hands
of
the
mite
she
is
not
not
a
bit
cried
miss
louisa
she
not
caught
i
go
and
bring
her
flannels
said
mr
massy
with
one
idea
i
can
bath
her
in
the
kitchen
then
said
mary
in
an
altered
cold
tone
you
ca
the
girl
is
scrubbing
there
said
miss
louisa
besides
she
does
want
a
bath
at
this
time
of
she
better
have
one
said
mary
quietly
out
of
submission
miss
louisa
gorge
rose
and
she
was
silent
when
the
little
man
padded
down
with
the
flannels
on
his
arm
mrs
lindley
asked
had
you
better
take
a
hot
bath
edward
but
the
sarcasm
was
lost
on
the
little
clergyman
he
was
absorbed
in
the
preparations
round
the
baby
the
room
was
dull
and
threadbare
and
the
snow
outside
seemed
by
comparison
so
white
on
the
lawn
and
tufted
on
the
bushes
indoors
the
heavy
pictures
hung
obscurely
on
the
walls
everything
was
dingy
with
gloom
except
in
the
fireglow
where
they
had
laid
the
bath
on
the
hearth
mrs
massy
her
black
hair
always
smoothly
coiled
and
queenly
kneeled
by
the
bath
wearing
a
rubber
apron
and
holding
the
kicking
child
her
husband
stood
holding
the
towels
and
the
flannels
to
warm
louisa
too
cross
to
share
in
the
joy
of
the
baby
bath
was
laying
the
table
the
boy
was
hanging
on
the
wrestling
with
it
to
get
out
his
father
looked
round
come
away
from
the
door
jack
he
said
ineffectually
jack
tugged
harder
at
the
knob
as
if
he
did
not
hear
mr
massy
blinked
at
him
he
must
come
away
from
the
door
mary
he
said
there
will
be
a
draught
if
it
is
jack
come
away
from
the
door
dear
said
the
mother
dexterously
turning
the
shiny
wet
baby
on
to
her
towelled
knee
then
glancing
round
go
and
tell
auntie
louisa
about
the
louisa
also
afraid
to
open
the
door
was
watching
the
scene
on
the
hearth
mr
massy
stood
holding
the
baby
flannel
as
if
assisting
at
some
ceremonial
if
everybody
had
not
been
subduedly
angry
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
i
want
to
see
out
of
the
window
jack
said
his
father
turned
hastily
do
you
mind
lifting
him
on
to
a
chair
louisa
said
mary
hastily
the
father
was
too
delicate
when
the
baby
was
flannelled
mr
massy
went
upstairs
and
returned
with
four
pillows
which
he
set
in
the
fender
to
warm
then
he
stood
watching
the
mother
feed
her
child
obsessed
by
the
idea
of
his
infant
louisa
went
on
with
her
preparations
for
the
meal
she
could
not
have
told
why
she
was
so
sullenly
angry
mrs
lindley
as
usual
lay
silently
watching
mary
carried
her
child
upstairs
followed
by
her
husband
with
the
pillows
after
a
while
he
came
down
again
what
is
mary
doing
why
does
she
come
down
to
eat
asked
mrs
lindley
she
is
staying
with
baby
the
room
is
rather
cold
i
will
ask
the
girl
to
put
in
a
he
was
going
absorbedly
to
the
door
but
mary
has
had
nothing
to
eat
it
is
she
who
will
catch
cold
said
the
mother
exasperated
mr
massy
seemed
as
if
he
did
not
hear
yet
he
looked
at
his
and
answered
i
will
take
her
he
went
out
mrs
lindley
shifted
on
her
couch
with
anger
miss
louisa
glowered
but
no
one
said
anything
because
of
the
money
that
came
to
the
vicarage
from
mr
massy
louisa
went
upstairs
her
sister
was
sitting
by
the
bed
reading
a
scrap
of
paper
wo
you
come
down
and
eat
the
younger
asked
in
a
moment
or
two
mary
replied
in
a
quiet
reserved
voice
that
forbade
anyone
to
approach
her
it
was
this
that
made
miss
louisa
most
furious
she
went
downstairs
and
announced
to
her
mother
i
am
going
out
i
may
not
be
home
to
viii
no
one
remarked
on
her
exit
she
put
on
her
fur
hat
that
the
village
people
knew
so
well
and
the
old
norfolk
jacket
louisa
was
short
and
plump
and
plain
she
had
her
mother
heavy
jaw
her
father
proud
brow
and
her
own
grey
brooding
eyes
that
were
very
beautiful
when
she
smiled
it
was
true
as
the
people
said
that
she
looked
sulky
her
chief
attraction
was
her
glistening
heavy
hair
which
shone
and
gleamed
with
a
richness
that
was
not
entirely
foreign
to
her
where
am
i
going
she
said
to
herself
when
she
got
outside
in
the
snow
she
did
not
hesitate
however
but
by
mechanical
walking
found
herself
descending
the
hill
towards
old
aldecross
in
the
valley
that
was
black
with
trees
the
colliery
breathed
in
stertorous
pants
sending
out
high
conical
columns
of
steam
that
remained
upright
whiter
than
the
snow
on
the
hills
yet
shadowy
in
the
dead
air
louisa
would
not
acknowledge
to
herself
whither
she
was
making
her
way
till
she
came
to
the
railway
crossing
then
the
bunches
of
snow
in
the
twigs
of
the
apple
tree
that
leaned
towards
the
fence
told
her
she
must
go
and
see
mrs
durant
the
tree
was
in
mrs
durant
garden
alfred
was
now
at
home
again
living
with
his
mother
in
the
cottage
below
the
road
from
the
highway
hedge
by
the
railway
crossing
the
snowy
garden
sheered
down
steeply
like
the
side
of
a
hole
then
dropped
straight
in
a
wall
in
this
depth
the
house
was
snug
its
chimney
just
level
with
the
road
miss
louisa
descended
the
stone
stairs
and
stood
below
in
the
little
backyard
in
the
dimness
and
the
a
big
tree
leaned
overhead
above
the
paraffin
hut
louisa
felt
secure
from
all
the
world
down
there
she
knocked
at
the
open
door
then
looked
round
the
tongue
of
garden
narrowing
in
from
the
quarry
bed
was
white
with
snow
she
thought
of
the
thick
fringes
of
snowdrops
it
would
show
beneath
the
currant
bushes
in
a
month
time
the
ragged
fringe
of
pinks
hanging
over
the
garden
brim
behind
her
was
whitened
now
with
that
in
summer
held
white
blossom
to
louisa
face
it
was
pleasant
she
thought
to
gather
flowers
that
stooped
to
one
face
from
above
she
knocked
again
peeping
in
she
saw
the
scarlet
glow
of
the
kitchen
red
firelight
falling
on
the
brick
floor
and
on
the
bright
chintz
cushions
it
was
alive
and
bright
as
a
she
crossed
the
scullery
where
still
an
almanac
hung
there
was
no
one
about
mrs
durant
called
louisa
softly
mrs
she
went
up
the
brick
step
into
the
front
room
that
still
had
its
little
shop
counter
and
its
bundles
of
goods
and
she
called
from
the
then
she
knew
mrs
durant
was
out
she
went
into
the
yard
to
follow
the
old
woman
footsteps
up
the
garden
path
she
emerged
from
the
bushes
and
raspberry
canes
there
was
the
whole
quarry
bed
a
wide
garden
white
and
dimmed
brindled
with
dark
bushes
lying
half
submerged
on
the
left
overhead
the
little
colliery
train
rumbled
by
right
away
at
the
back
was
a
mass
of
trees
louisa
followed
the
open
path
looking
from
right
to
left
and
then
she
gave
a
cry
of
concern
the
old
woman
was
sitting
rocking
slightly
among
the
ragged
snowy
cabbages
louisa
ran
to
her
found
her
whimpering
with
little
involuntary
cries
whatever
have
you
done
cried
louisa
kneeling
in
the
snow
was
pulling
a
tore
inside
me
i
had
a
pain
the
old
woman
wept
from
shock
and
suffering
gasping
between
her
i
had
a
pain
long
she
panted
pressed
her
hand
on
her
side
leaned
as
if
she
would
faint
looking
yellow
against
the
snow
louisa
supported
her
do
you
think
you
could
walk
now
she
asked
yes
gasped
the
old
woman
louisa
helped
her
to
her
feet
get
the
want
it
for
alfred
dinner
panted
mrs
durant
louisa
picked
up
the
stalk
of
and
with
difficulty
got
the
old
woman
indoors
she
gave
her
brandy
laid
her
on
the
couch
saying
i
going
to
send
for
a
just
a
the
young
woman
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
a
few
yards
away
the
landlady
was
astonished
to
see
miss
louisa
will
you
send
for
a
doctor
at
once
to
mrs
durant
she
said
with
some
of
her
father
in
her
commanding
tone
is
something
the
matter
fluttered
the
landlady
in
concern
louisa
glancing
out
up
the
road
saw
the
grocer
cart
driving
to
eastwood
she
ran
and
stopped
the
man
and
told
him
mrs
durant
lay
on
the
sofa
her
face
turned
away
when
the
young
woman
came
back
let
me
put
you
to
bed
louisa
said
mrs
durant
did
not
resist
louisa
knew
the
ways
of
the
working
people
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
dresser
she
found
dusters
and
flannels
with
the
old
she
snatched
out
the
oven
shelves
wrapped
them
up
and
put
them
in
the
bed
from
the
son
bed
she
took
a
blanket
and
running
down
set
it
before
the
fire
having
undressed
the
little
old
woman
louisa
carried
her
upstairs
you
drop
me
you
drop
me
cried
mrs
durant
louisa
did
not
answer
but
bore
her
burden
quickly
she
could
not
light
a
fire
because
there
was
no
in
the
bedroom
and
the
floor
was
plaster
so
she
fetched
the
lamp
and
stood
it
lighted
in
one
corner
it
will
air
the
room
she
said
yes
moaned
the
old
woman
louisa
ran
with
more
hot
flannels
replacing
those
from
the
oven
shelves
then
she
made
a
and
laid
it
on
the
woman
side
there
was
a
big
lump
on
the
side
of
the
abdomen
i
felt
it
coming
a
long
time
moaned
the
old
lady
when
the
pain
was
easier
but
i
not
said
anything
i
did
want
to
upset
our
louisa
did
not
see
why
our
alfred
should
be
spared
what
time
is
it
came
the
plaintive
voice
a
quarter
to
oh
wailed
the
old
lady
he
be
here
in
half
an
hour
and
no
dinner
ready
for
let
me
do
it
said
louisa
gently
there
that
you
find
the
meat
in
the
an
apple
pie
you
can
hot
up
but
do
you
do
who
will
then
asked
louisa
i
do
know
moaned
the
sick
woman
unable
to
consider
louisa
did
it
the
doctor
came
and
gave
serious
examination
he
looked
very
grave
what
is
it
doctor
asked
the
old
lady
looking
up
at
him
with
old
pathetic
eyes
in
which
already
hope
was
dead
i
think
you
torn
the
skin
in
which
a
tumour
hangs
he
replied
ay
she
murmured
and
she
turned
away
you
see
she
may
die
any
it
may
be
swaled
away
said
the
old
doctor
to
louisa
the
young
woman
went
upstairs
again
he
says
the
lump
may
be
swaled
away
and
you
may
get
quite
well
again
she
said
ay
murmured
the
old
lady
it
did
not
deceive
her
presently
she
asked
is
there
a
good
fire
i
think
so
answered
louisa
he
want
a
good
fire
the
mother
said
louisa
attended
to
it
since
the
death
of
durant
the
widow
had
come
to
church
occasionally
and
louisa
had
been
friendly
to
her
in
the
girl
heart
the
purpose
was
fixed
no
man
had
affected
her
as
alfred
durant
had
done
and
to
that
she
kept
in
her
heart
she
adhered
to
him
a
natural
sympathy
existed
between
her
and
his
rather
hard
materialistic
mother
alfred
was
the
most
lovable
of
the
old
woman
sons
he
had
grown
up
like
the
rest
however
headstrong
and
blind
to
everything
but
his
own
will
like
the
other
boys
he
had
insisted
on
going
into
the
pit
as
soon
as
he
left
school
because
that
was
the
only
way
speedily
to
become
a
man
level
with
all
the
other
men
this
was
a
great
chagrin
to
his
mother
who
would
have
liked
to
have
this
last
of
her
sons
a
gentleman
but
still
he
remained
constant
to
her
his
feeling
for
her
was
deep
and
unexpressed
he
noticed
when
she
was
tired
or
when
she
had
a
new
cap
and
he
bought
little
things
for
her
occasionally
she
was
not
wise
enough
to
see
how
much
he
lived
by
her
at
the
bottom
he
did
not
satisfy
her
he
did
not
seem
manly
enough
he
liked
to
read
books
occasionally
and
better
still
he
liked
to
play
the
piccolo
it
amused
her
to
see
his
head
nod
over
the
instrument
as
he
made
an
effort
to
get
the
right
note
it
made
her
fond
of
him
with
tenderness
almost
pity
but
not
with
respect
she
wanted
a
man
to
be
fixed
going
his
own
way
without
knowledge
of
women
whereas
she
knew
alfred
depended
on
her
he
sang
in
the
choir
because
he
liked
singing
in
the
summer
he
worked
in
the
garden
attended
to
the
fowls
and
pigs
he
kept
pigeons
he
played
on
saturday
in
the
cricket
or
football
team
but
to
her
he
did
not
seem
the
man
the
independent
man
her
other
boys
had
been
he
was
her
whilst
she
loved
him
for
it
she
was
a
little
bit
contemptuous
of
him
there
grew
up
a
little
hostility
between
them
then
he
began
to
drink
as
the
others
had
done
but
not
in
their
blind
oblivious
way
he
was
a
little
over
it
she
saw
this
and
she
pitied
it
in
him
she
loved
him
most
but
she
was
not
satisfied
with
him
because
he
was
not
free
of
her
he
could
not
quite
go
his
own
way
then
at
twenty
he
ran
away
and
served
his
time
in
the
navy
this
made
a
man
of
him
he
had
hated
it
bitterly
the
service
the
subordination
for
years
he
fought
with
himself
under
the
military
discipline
for
his
own
struggling
through
blind
anger
and
shame
and
a
cramping
sense
of
inferiority
out
of
humiliation
and
he
rose
into
a
sort
of
inner
freedom
and
his
love
for
his
mother
whom
he
idealised
remained
the
fact
of
hope
and
of
belief
he
came
home
again
nearly
thirty
years
old
but
naïve
and
inexperienced
as
a
boy
only
with
a
silence
about
him
that
was
new
a
sort
of
dumb
humility
before
life
a
fear
of
living
he
was
almost
quite
chaste
a
strong
sensitiveness
had
kept
him
from
women
sexual
talk
was
all
very
well
among
men
but
somehow
it
had
no
application
to
living
women
there
were
two
things
for
him
the
idea
of
women
with
which
he
sometimes
debauched
himself
and
real
women
before
whom
he
felt
a
deep
uneasiness
and
a
need
to
draw
away
he
shrank
and
defended
himself
from
the
approach
of
any
woman
and
then
he
felt
ashamed
in
his
innermost
soul
he
felt
he
was
not
a
man
he
was
less
than
the
normal
man
in
genoa
he
went
with
an
under
officer
to
a
drinking
house
where
the
cheaper
sort
of
girl
came
in
to
look
for
lovers
he
sat
there
with
his
glass
the
girls
looked
at
him
but
they
never
came
to
him
he
knew
that
if
they
did
come
he
could
only
pay
for
food
and
drink
for
them
because
he
felt
a
pity
for
them
and
was
anxious
lest
they
lacked
good
necessities
he
could
not
have
gone
with
one
of
them
he
knew
it
and
was
ashamed
looking
with
curious
envy
at
the
swaggering
italian
whose
body
went
to
a
woman
by
instinctive
impersonal
attraction
they
were
men
he
was
not
a
man
he
sat
feeling
short
feeling
like
a
leper
and
he
went
away
imagining
sexual
scenes
between
himself
and
a
woman
walking
wrapt
in
this
indulgence
but
when
the
ready
woman
presented
herself
the
very
fact
that
she
was
a
palpable
woman
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
touch
her
and
this
incapacity
was
like
a
core
of
rottenness
in
him
so
several
times
he
went
drunk
with
his
companions
to
the
licensed
prostitute
houses
abroad
but
the
sordid
insignificance
of
the
experience
appalled
him
it
had
not
been
anything
really
it
meant
nothing
he
felt
as
if
he
were
not
physically
but
spiritually
impotent
not
actually
impotent
but
intrinsically
so
he
came
home
with
this
secret
never
changing
burden
of
his
unknown
unbestowed
self
torturing
him
his
navy
training
left
him
in
perfect
physical
condition
he
was
sensible
of
and
proud
of
his
body
he
bathed
and
used
and
kept
himself
fit
he
played
cricket
and
football
he
read
books
and
began
to
hold
fixed
ideas
which
he
got
from
the
fabians
he
played
his
piccolo
and
was
considered
an
expert
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
was
always
this
canker
of
shame
and
incompleteness
he
was
miserable
beneath
all
his
healthy
cheerfulness
he
was
uneasy
and
felt
despicable
among
all
his
confidence
and
superiority
of
ideas
he
would
have
changed
with
any
mere
brute
just
to
be
free
of
himself
to
be
free
of
this
shame
of
he
saw
some
collier
lurching
straight
forward
without
misgiving
pursuing
his
own
satisfactions
and
he
envied
him
anything
he
would
have
given
anything
for
this
spontaneity
and
this
blind
stupidity
which
went
to
its
own
satisfaction
direct
ix
he
was
not
unhappy
in
the
pit
he
was
admired
by
the
men
and
well
enough
liked
it
was
only
he
himself
who
felt
the
difference
between
himself
and
the
others
he
seemed
to
hide
his
own
stigma
but
he
was
never
sure
that
the
others
did
not
really
despise
him
for
a
ninny
as
being
less
a
man
than
they
were
only
he
pretended
to
be
more
manly
and
was
surprised
by
the
ease
with
which
they
were
deceived
and
being
naturally
cheerful
he
was
happy
at
his
work
he
was
sure
of
himself
there
naked
to
the
waist
hot
and
grimy
with
labour
they
squatted
on
their
heels
for
a
few
minutes
and
talked
seeing
each
other
dimly
by
the
light
of
the
safety
lamps
while
the
black
coal
rose
jutting
round
them
and
the
props
of
wood
stood
like
little
pillars
in
the
low
black
very
dark
temple
then
the
pony
came
and
the
with
a
message
from
number
or
with
a
bottle
of
water
from
the
or
some
news
of
the
world
above
the
day
passed
pleasantly
enough
there
was
an
ease
a
about
the
day
underground
a
delightful
camaraderie
of
men
shut
off
alone
from
the
rest
of
the
world
in
a
dangerous
place
and
a
variety
of
labour
holing
loading
timbering
and
a
glamour
of
mystery
and
adventure
in
the
atmosphere
that
made
the
pit
not
unattractive
to
him
when
he
had
again
got
over
his
anguish
of
desire
for
the
open
air
and
the
sea
this
day
there
was
much
to
do
and
durant
was
not
in
humour
to
talk
he
went
on
working
in
silence
through
the
afternoon
came
and
they
tramped
to
the
bottom
the
whitewashed
underground
office
shone
brightly
men
were
putting
out
their
lamps
they
sat
in
dozens
round
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
down
which
black
heavy
drops
of
water
fell
continuously
into
the
sump
the
electric
lights
shone
away
down
the
main
underground
road
is
it
raining
asked
durant
snowing
said
an
old
man
and
the
younger
was
pleased
he
liked
to
go
up
when
it
was
snowing
it
just
come
right
for
christmas
said
the
old
man
ay
replied
durant
a
green
christmas
a
fat
churchyard
said
the
other
sententiously
durant
laughed
showing
his
small
rather
pointed
teeth
the
cage
came
down
a
dozen
men
lined
on
durant
noticed
tufts
of
snow
on
the
perforated
arched
roof
of
the
chain
and
he
was
pleased
he
wondered
how
it
liked
its
excursion
underground
but
already
it
was
getting
soppy
with
black
water
he
liked
things
about
him
there
was
a
little
smile
on
his
face
but
underlying
it
was
the
curious
consciousness
he
felt
in
himself
the
upper
world
came
almost
with
a
flash
because
of
the
glimmer
of
snow
hurrying
along
the
bank
giving
up
his
lamp
at
the
office
he
smiled
to
feel
the
open
about
him
again
all
glimmering
round
him
with
snow
the
hills
on
either
side
were
pale
blue
in
the
dusk
and
the
hedges
looked
savage
and
dark
the
snow
was
trampled
between
the
railway
lines
but
far
ahead
beyond
the
black
figures
of
miners
moving
home
it
became
smooth
again
spreading
right
up
to
the
dark
wall
of
the
coppice
to
the
west
there
was
a
pinkness
and
a
big
star
hovered
half
revealed
below
the
lights
of
the
pit
came
out
crisp
and
yellow
among
the
darkness
of
the
buildings
and
the
lights
of
old
aldecross
twinkled
in
rows
down
the
bluish
twilight
durant
walked
glad
with
life
among
the
miners
who
were
all
talking
animatedly
because
of
the
snow
he
liked
their
company
he
liked
the
white
dusky
world
it
gave
him
a
little
thrill
to
stop
at
the
garden
gate
and
see
the
light
of
home
down
below
shining
on
the
silent
blue
snow
x
by
the
big
gate
of
the
railway
in
the
fence
was
a
little
gate
that
he
kept
locked
as
he
unfastened
it
he
watched
the
kitchen
light
that
shone
on
to
the
bushes
and
the
snow
outside
it
was
a
candle
burning
till
night
set
in
he
thought
to
himself
he
slid
down
the
steep
path
to
the
level
below
he
liked
making
the
first
marks
in
the
smooth
snow
then
he
came
through
the
bushes
to
the
house
the
two
women
heard
his
heavy
boots
ring
outside
on
the
scraper
and
his
voice
as
he
opened
the
door
how
much
worth
of
oil
do
you
reckon
to
save
by
that
candle
mother
he
liked
a
good
light
from
the
lamp
he
had
just
put
down
his
bottle
and
and
was
hanging
his
coat
behind
the
scullery
door
when
miss
louisa
came
upon
him
he
was
startled
but
he
smiled
his
eyes
began
to
his
face
went
suddenly
straight
and
he
was
afraid
your
mother
had
an
accident
she
said
how
he
exclaimed
in
the
garden
she
answered
he
hesitated
with
his
coat
in
his
hands
then
he
hung
it
up
and
turned
to
the
kitchen
is
she
in
bed
he
asked
yes
said
miss
louisa
who
found
it
hard
to
deceive
him
he
was
silent
he
went
into
the
kitchen
sat
down
heavily
in
his
old
chair
and
began
to
pull
off
his
boots
his
head
was
small
rather
finely
shapen
his
brown
hair
close
and
crisp
would
look
jolly
whatever
happened
he
wore
heavy
moleskin
trousers
that
gave
off
the
stale
exhausted
scent
of
the
pit
having
put
on
his
slippers
he
carried
his
boots
into
the
scullery
what
is
it
he
asked
afraid
something
internal
she
replied
he
went
upstairs
his
mother
kept
herself
calm
for
his
coming
louisa
felt
his
tread
shake
the
plaster
floor
of
the
bedroom
above
what
have
you
done
he
asked
it
nothing
my
lad
said
the
old
woman
rather
hard
it
nothing
you
need
fret
my
boy
it
nothing
more
the
matter
with
me
than
i
had
yesterday
or
last
week
the
doctor
said
i
done
nothing
what
were
you
doing
asked
her
son
i
was
pulling
up
a
cabbage
and
i
suppose
i
pulled
too
hard
for
was
such
a
her
son
looked
at
her
quickly
she
hardened
herself
but
who
does
have
a
sudden
pain
sometimes
my
boy
we
all
and
what
it
done
i
do
know
she
said
but
i
do
suppose
it
the
big
lamp
in
the
corner
was
screened
with
a
dark
green
so
that
he
could
scarcely
see
her
face
he
was
strung
tight
with
apprehension
and
many
emotions
then
his
brow
knitted
what
did
you
go
pulling
your
inside
out
at
cabbages
for
he
asked
and
the
ground
frozen
you
go
on
dragging
and
dragging
if
you
killed
somebody
got
to
get
them
she
said
you
need
do
yourself
but
they
had
reached
futility
miss
louisa
could
hear
plainly
downstairs
her
heart
sank
it
seemed
so
hopeless
between
them
are
you
sure
it
nothing
much
mother
he
asked
appealing
after
a
little
silence
ay
it
nothing
said
the
old
woman
rather
bitter
i
do
want
you
be
go
an
get
your
dinner
she
said
she
knew
she
was
going
to
die
moreover
the
pain
was
torture
just
then
they
only
cosseting
me
up
a
bit
because
i
an
old
woman
miss
louisa
very
she
have
got
your
dinner
ready
so
you
better
go
and
eat
he
felt
stupid
and
ashamed
his
mother
put
him
off
he
had
to
turn
away
the
pain
burned
in
his
bowels
he
went
downstairs
the
mother
was
glad
he
was
gone
so
that
she
could
moan
with
pain
he
had
resumed
the
old
habit
of
eating
before
he
washed
himself
miss
louisa
served
his
dinner
it
was
strange
and
exciting
to
her
she
was
strung
up
tense
trying
to
understand
him
and
his
mother
she
watched
him
as
he
sat
he
was
turned
away
from
his
food
looking
in
the
fire
her
soul
watched
him
trying
to
see
what
he
was
his
black
face
and
arms
were
uncouth
he
was
foreign
his
face
was
masked
black
with
she
could
not
see
him
she
could
not
even
know
him
the
brown
eyebrows
the
steady
eyes
the
coarse
small
moustache
above
the
closed
were
the
only
familiar
indications
what
was
he
as
he
sat
there
in
his
she
could
not
see
him
and
it
hurt
her
she
ran
upstairs
presently
coming
down
with
the
flannels
and
the
to
heat
them
because
the
pain
was
on
again
he
was
through
his
dinner
he
put
down
the
fork
suddenly
nauseated
they
will
soothe
the
wrench
she
said
he
watched
useless
and
left
out
is
she
bad
he
asked
i
think
she
is
she
answered
it
was
useless
for
him
to
stir
or
comment
louisa
was
busy
she
went
upstairs
the
poor
old
woman
was
in
a
white
cold
sweat
of
pain
louisa
face
was
sullen
with
suffering
as
she
went
about
to
relieve
her
then
she
sat
and
waited
the
pain
passed
gradually
the
old
woman
sank
into
a
state
of
coma
louisa
still
sat
silent
by
the
bed
she
heard
the
sound
of
water
downstairs
then
came
the
voice
of
the
old
mother
faint
but
unrelaxing
alfred
washing
want
his
back
louisa
listened
anxiously
wondering
what
the
sick
woman
wanted
he
ca
bear
if
his
back
is
the
old
woman
persisted
in
a
cruel
attention
to
his
needs
louisa
rose
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
the
yellowish
brow
i
will
go
down
she
said
soothingly
if
you
would
murmured
the
sick
woman
louisa
waited
a
moment
mrs
durant
closed
her
eyes
having
discharged
her
duty
the
young
woman
went
downstairs
herself
or
the
man
what
did
they
matter
only
the
suffering
woman
must
be
considered
alfred
was
kneeling
on
the
hearthrug
stripped
to
the
waist
washing
himself
in
a
large
panchion
of
earthenware
he
did
so
every
evening
when
he
had
eaten
his
dinner
his
brothers
had
done
so
before
him
but
miss
louisa
was
strange
in
the
house
he
was
mechanically
rubbing
the
white
lather
on
his
head
with
a
repeated
unconscious
movement
his
hand
every
now
and
then
passing
over
his
neck
louisa
watched
she
had
to
brace
herself
to
this
also
he
bent
his
head
into
the
water
washed
it
free
of
soap
and
pressed
the
water
out
of
his
eyes
your
mother
said
you
would
want
your
back
washing
she
said
curious
how
it
hurt
her
to
take
part
in
their
fixed
routine
of
life
louisa
felt
the
almost
repulsive
intimacy
being
forced
upon
her
it
was
all
so
common
so
like
herding
she
lost
her
own
distinctness
he
ducked
his
face
round
looking
up
at
her
in
what
was
a
very
comical
way
she
had
to
harden
herself
how
funny
he
looks
with
his
face
upside
down
she
thought
after
all
there
was
a
difference
between
her
and
the
common
people
the
water
in
which
his
arms
were
plunged
was
quite
black
the
was
darkish
she
could
scarcely
conceive
him
as
human
mechanically
under
the
influence
of
habit
he
groped
in
the
black
water
fished
out
soap
and
flannel
and
handed
them
backward
to
louisa
then
he
remained
rigid
and
submissive
his
two
arms
thrust
straight
in
the
panchion
supporting
the
weight
of
his
shoulders
his
skin
was
beautifully
white
and
unblemished
of
an
opaque
solid
whiteness
gradually
louisa
saw
it
this
also
was
what
he
was
it
fascinated
her
her
feeling
of
separateness
passed
away
she
ceased
to
draw
back
from
contact
with
him
and
his
mother
there
was
this
living
centre
her
heart
ran
hot
she
had
reached
some
goal
in
this
beautiful
clear
male
body
she
loved
him
in
a
white
impersonal
heat
but
the
reddish
neck
and
ears
they
were
more
personal
more
curious
a
tenderness
rose
in
her
she
loved
even
his
queer
ears
a
intimate
being
he
was
to
her
she
put
down
the
towel
and
went
upstairs
again
troubled
in
her
heart
she
had
only
seen
one
human
being
in
her
that
was
mary
all
the
rest
were
strangers
now
her
soul
was
going
to
open
she
was
going
to
see
another
she
felt
strange
and
pregnant
he
be
more
comfortable
murmured
the
sick
woman
abstractedly
as
louisa
entered
the
room
the
latter
did
not
answer
her
own
heart
was
heavy
with
its
own
responsibility
mrs
durant
lay
silent
awhile
then
she
murmured
plaintively
you
must
mind
miss
why
should
i
replied
louisa
deeply
moved
it
what
we
used
to
said
the
old
woman
and
louisa
felt
herself
excluded
again
from
their
life
she
sat
in
pain
with
the
tears
of
disappointment
distilling
her
heart
was
that
all
alfred
came
upstairs
he
was
clean
and
in
his
he
looked
a
workman
now
louisa
felt
that
she
and
he
were
foreigners
moving
in
different
lives
it
dulled
her
again
oh
if
she
could
only
find
some
fixed
relations
something
sure
and
abiding
how
do
you
feel
he
said
to
his
mother
it
a
bit
better
she
replied
wearily
impersonally
this
strange
putting
herself
aside
this
abstracting
herself
and
answering
him
only
what
she
thought
good
for
him
to
hear
made
the
relations
between
mother
and
son
poignant
and
cramping
to
miss
louisa
it
made
the
man
so
ineffectual
so
nothing
louisa
groped
as
if
she
had
lost
him
the
mother
was
real
and
was
not
very
actual
it
puzzled
and
chilled
the
young
woman
i
better
fetch
mrs
harrison
he
said
waiting
for
his
mother
to
decide
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
have
somebody
she
replied
miss
louisa
stood
by
afraid
to
interfere
in
their
business
they
did
not
include
her
in
their
lives
they
felt
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
except
as
a
help
from
outside
she
was
quite
external
to
them
she
felt
hurt
and
powerless
against
this
unconscious
difference
but
something
patient
and
unyielding
in
her
made
her
say
i
will
stay
and
do
the
nursing
you
ca
be
the
other
two
were
shy
and
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
wes
manage
to
get
somebody
said
the
old
woman
wearily
she
did
not
care
very
much
what
happened
now
i
will
stay
until
tomorrow
in
any
case
said
louisa
then
we
can
i
sure
you
no
right
to
trouble
yourself
moaned
the
old
woman
but
she
must
leave
herself
in
any
hands
miss
louisa
felt
glad
that
she
was
admitted
even
in
an
official
capacity
she
wanted
to
share
their
lives
at
home
they
would
need
her
now
mary
had
come
but
they
must
manage
without
her
i
must
write
a
note
to
the
vicarage
she
said
alfred
durant
looked
at
her
inquiringly
for
her
service
he
had
always
that
intelligent
readiness
to
serve
since
he
had
been
in
the
navy
but
there
was
a
simple
independence
in
his
willingness
which
she
loved
she
felt
nevertheless
it
was
hard
to
get
at
him
he
was
so
deferential
quick
to
take
the
slightest
suggestion
of
an
order
from
her
implicitly
that
she
could
not
get
at
the
man
in
him
he
looked
at
her
very
keenly
she
noticed
his
eyes
were
golden
brown
with
a
very
small
pupil
the
kind
of
eyes
that
can
see
a
long
way
off
he
stood
alert
at
military
attention
his
face
was
still
rather
do
you
want
pen
and
paper
he
asked
with
deferential
suggestion
to
a
superior
which
was
more
difficult
for
her
than
reserve
yes
please
she
said
he
turned
and
went
downstairs
he
seemed
to
her
so
so
utterly
sure
in
his
movement
how
was
she
to
approach
him
for
he
would
take
not
one
step
towards
her
he
would
only
put
himself
entirely
and
impersonally
at
her
service
glad
to
serve
her
but
keeping
himself
quite
removed
from
her
she
could
see
he
felt
real
joy
in
doing
anything
for
her
but
any
recognition
would
confuse
him
and
hurt
him
strange
it
was
to
her
to
have
a
man
going
about
the
house
in
his
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
his
throat
bare
waiting
on
her
he
moved
well
as
if
he
had
plenty
of
life
to
spare
she
was
attracted
by
his
completeness
and
yet
when
all
was
ready
and
there
was
nothing
more
for
him
to
do
she
quivered
meeting
his
questioning
look
as
she
sat
writing
he
placed
another
candle
near
her
the
rather
dense
light
fell
in
two
places
on
the
overfoldings
of
her
hair
till
it
glistened
heavy
and
bright
like
a
dense
golden
plumage
folded
up
then
the
nape
of
her
neck
was
very
white
with
fine
down
and
pointed
wisps
of
gold
he
watched
it
as
it
were
a
vision
losing
himself
she
was
all
that
was
beyond
him
of
revelation
and
exquisiteness
all
that
was
ideal
and
beyond
him
she
was
he
was
lost
to
himself
in
looking
at
her
she
had
no
connection
with
him
he
did
not
approach
her
she
was
there
like
a
wonderful
distance
but
it
was
a
treat
having
her
in
the
house
even
with
this
anguish
for
his
mother
tightening
about
him
he
was
sensible
of
the
wonder
of
living
this
evening
the
candles
glistened
on
her
hair
and
seemed
to
fascinate
him
he
felt
a
little
awe
of
her
and
a
sense
of
uplifting
that
he
and
she
and
his
mother
should
be
together
for
a
time
in
the
strange
unknown
atmosphere
and
when
he
got
out
of
the
house
he
was
afraid
he
saw
the
stars
above
ringing
with
fine
brightness
the
snow
beneath
just
visible
and
a
new
night
was
gathering
round
him
he
was
afraid
almost
with
obliteration
what
was
this
new
night
ringing
about
him
and
what
was
he
he
could
not
recognize
himself
nor
any
of
his
surroundings
he
was
afraid
to
think
of
his
mother
and
yet
his
chest
was
conscious
of
her
and
of
what
was
happening
to
her
he
could
not
escape
from
her
she
carried
him
with
her
into
an
unformed
unknown
chaos
xi
he
went
up
the
road
in
an
agony
not
knowing
what
it
was
all
about
but
feeling
as
if
a
iron
were
gripped
round
his
chest
without
thinking
he
shook
two
or
three
tears
on
to
the
snow
yet
in
his
mind
he
did
not
believe
his
mother
would
die
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
greater
consciousness
as
he
sat
in
the
hall
of
the
vicarage
waiting
whilst
mary
put
things
for
louisa
into
a
bag
he
wondered
why
he
had
been
so
upset
he
felt
abashed
and
humbled
by
the
big
house
he
felt
again
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
rank
and
file
when
miss
mary
spoke
to
him
he
almost
saluted
an
honest
man
thought
mary
and
the
patronage
was
applied
as
salve
to
her
own
sickness
she
had
station
so
she
could
patronize
it
was
almost
all
that
was
left
to
her
but
she
could
not
have
lived
without
having
a
certain
position
she
could
never
have
trusted
herself
outside
a
definite
place
nor
respected
herself
except
as
a
woman
of
superior
class
as
alfred
came
to
the
he
felt
the
grief
at
his
heart
again
and
saw
the
new
heavens
he
stood
a
moment
looking
northward
to
the
plough
climbing
up
the
night
and
at
the
far
glimmer
of
snow
in
distant
fields
then
his
grief
came
on
like
physical
pain
he
held
tight
to
the
gate
biting
his
mouth
whispering
mother
it
was
a
fierce
cutting
physical
pain
of
grief
that
came
on
in
bouts
as
his
mother
pain
came
on
in
bouts
and
was
so
acute
he
could
scarcely
keep
erect
he
did
not
know
where
it
came
from
the
pain
nor
why
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
thoughts
almost
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
only
it
gripped
him
and
he
must
submit
the
whole
tide
of
his
soul
gathering
in
its
unknown
towards
this
expansion
into
death
carried
him
with
it
helplessly
all
the
fritter
of
his
thought
and
consciousness
caught
up
as
nothing
the
heave
passing
on
towards
its
breaking
taking
him
further
than
he
had
ever
been
when
the
young
man
had
regained
himself
he
went
indoors
and
there
he
was
almost
gay
it
seemed
to
excite
him
he
felt
in
high
spirits
he
made
whimsical
fun
of
things
he
sat
on
one
side
of
his
mother
bed
louisa
on
the
other
and
a
certain
gaiety
seized
them
all
but
the
night
and
the
dread
was
coming
on
alfred
kissed
his
mother
and
went
to
bed
when
he
was
half
undressed
the
knowledge
of
his
mother
came
upon
him
and
the
suffering
seized
him
in
its
grip
like
two
hands
in
agony
he
lay
on
the
bed
screwed
up
tight
it
lasted
so
long
and
exhausted
him
so
much
that
he
fell
asleep
without
having
the
energy
to
get
up
and
finish
undressing
he
awoke
after
midnight
to
find
himself
stone
cold
he
undressed
and
got
into
bed
and
was
soon
asleep
again
at
a
quarter
to
six
he
woke
and
instantly
remembered
having
pulled
on
his
trousers
and
lighted
a
candle
he
went
into
his
mother
room
he
put
his
hand
before
the
candle
flame
so
that
no
light
fell
on
the
bed
mother
he
whispered
yes
was
the
reply
there
was
a
hesitation
should
i
go
to
work
he
waited
his
heart
was
beating
heavily
i
think
i
go
my
his
heart
went
down
in
a
kind
of
despair
you
want
me
to
he
let
his
hand
down
from
the
candle
flame
the
light
fell
on
the
bed
there
he
saw
louisa
lying
looking
up
at
him
her
eyes
were
upon
him
she
quickly
shut
her
eyes
and
half
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
her
back
turned
to
him
he
saw
the
rough
hair
like
bright
vapour
about
her
round
head
and
the
two
plaits
flung
coiled
among
the
bedclothes
it
gave
him
a
shock
he
stood
almost
himself
determined
louisa
cowered
down
he
looked
and
met
his
mother
eyes
then
he
gave
way
again
and
ceased
to
be
sure
ceased
to
be
himself
yes
go
to
work
my
boy
said
the
mother
all
right
replied
he
kissing
her
his
heart
was
down
at
despair
and
bitter
he
went
away
alfred
cried
his
mother
faintly
he
came
back
with
beating
heart
what
mother
you
always
do
what
right
alfred
the
mother
asked
beside
herself
in
terror
now
he
was
leaving
her
he
was
too
terrified
and
bewildered
to
know
what
she
meant
yes
he
said
she
turned
her
cheek
to
him
he
kissed
her
then
went
away
in
bitter
despair
he
went
to
work
xii
by
midday
his
mother
was
dead
the
word
met
him
at
the
as
he
had
known
inwardly
it
was
not
a
shock
to
him
and
yet
he
trembled
he
went
home
quite
calmly
feeling
only
heavy
in
his
breathing
miss
louisa
was
still
at
the
house
she
had
seen
to
everything
possible
very
succinctly
she
informed
him
of
what
he
needed
to
know
but
there
was
one
point
of
anxiety
for
her
you
did
half
expect
not
come
as
a
blow
to
you
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
her
eyes
were
dark
and
calm
and
searching
she
too
felt
lost
he
was
so
dark
and
inchoate
i
he
said
stupidly
he
looked
aside
unable
to
endure
her
eyes
on
him
i
could
not
bear
to
think
you
might
not
have
guessed
she
said
he
did
not
answer
he
felt
it
a
great
strain
to
have
her
near
him
at
this
time
he
wanted
to
be
alone
as
soon
as
the
relatives
began
to
arrive
louisa
departed
and
came
no
more
while
everything
was
arranging
and
a
crowd
was
in
the
house
whilst
he
had
business
to
settle
he
went
well
enough
with
only
those
uncontrollable
paroxysms
of
grief
for
the
rest
he
was
superficial
by
himself
he
endured
the
fierce
almost
insane
bursts
of
grief
which
passed
again
and
left
him
calm
almost
clear
just
wondering
he
had
not
known
before
that
everything
could
break
down
that
he
himself
could
break
down
and
all
be
a
great
chaos
very
vast
and
wonderful
it
seemed
as
if
life
in
him
had
burst
its
bounds
and
he
was
lost
in
a
great
bewildering
flood
immense
and
unpeopled
he
himself
was
broken
and
spilled
out
amid
it
all
he
could
only
breathe
panting
in
silence
then
the
anguish
came
on
again
when
all
the
people
had
gone
from
the
quarry
cottage
leaving
the
young
man
alone
with
an
elderly
housekeeper
then
the
long
trial
began
the
snow
had
thawed
and
frozen
a
fresh
fall
had
whitened
the
grey
this
then
began
to
thaw
the
world
was
a
place
of
loose
grey
slosh
alfred
had
nothing
to
do
in
the
evenings
he
was
a
man
whose
life
had
been
filled
up
with
small
activities
without
knowing
it
he
had
been
centralized
polarized
in
his
mother
it
was
she
who
had
kept
him
even
now
when
the
old
housekeeper
had
left
him
he
might
still
have
gone
on
in
his
old
way
but
the
force
and
balance
of
his
life
was
lacking
he
sat
pretending
to
read
all
the
time
holding
his
fists
clenched
and
holding
himself
in
enduring
he
did
not
know
what
he
walked
the
black
and
sodden
miles
of
till
he
was
tired
out
but
all
this
was
only
running
away
from
whence
he
must
return
at
work
he
was
all
right
if
it
had
been
summer
he
might
have
escaped
by
working
in
the
garden
till
bedtime
but
now
there
was
no
escape
no
relief
no
help
he
perhaps
was
made
for
action
rather
than
for
understanding
for
doing
than
for
being
he
was
shocked
out
of
his
activities
like
a
swimmer
who
forgets
to
swim
for
a
week
he
had
the
force
to
endure
this
suffocation
and
struggle
then
he
began
to
get
exhausted
and
knew
it
must
come
out
the
instinct
of
became
strongest
but
there
was
the
question
where
was
he
to
go
the
really
meant
nothing
to
him
it
was
no
good
going
there
he
began
to
think
of
emigration
in
another
country
he
would
be
all
right
he
wrote
to
the
emigration
offices
on
the
sunday
after
the
funeral
when
all
the
durant
people
had
attended
church
alfred
had
seen
miss
louisa
impassive
and
reserved
sitting
with
miss
mary
who
was
proud
and
very
distant
and
with
the
other
lindleys
who
were
people
removed
alfred
saw
them
as
people
remote
he
did
not
think
about
it
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
life
after
service
louisa
had
come
to
him
and
shaken
hands
my
sister
would
like
you
to
come
to
supper
one
evening
if
you
would
be
so
he
looked
at
miss
mary
who
bowed
out
of
kindness
mary
had
proposed
this
to
louisa
disapproving
of
herself
even
as
she
did
so
but
she
did
not
examine
herself
closely
yes
said
durant
awkwardly
i
come
if
you
want
but
he
vaguely
felt
that
it
was
misplaced
you
come
tomorrow
evening
then
about
he
went
miss
louisa
was
very
kind
to
him
there
could
be
no
music
because
of
the
babies
he
sat
with
his
fists
clenched
on
his
thighs
very
quiet
and
unmoved
lapsing
among
all
those
people
into
a
kind
of
muse
or
daze
there
was
nothing
between
him
and
them
they
knew
it
as
well
as
he
but
he
remained
very
steady
in
himself
and
the
evening
passed
slowly
mrs
lindley
called
him
young
man
will
you
sit
here
young
man
he
sat
there
one
name
was
as
good
as
another
what
had
they
to
do
with
him
mr
lindley
kept
a
special
tone
for
him
kind
indulgent
but
patronizing
durant
took
it
all
without
criticism
or
offence
just
submitting
but
he
did
not
want
to
troubled
him
to
have
to
eat
in
their
presence
he
knew
he
was
out
of
place
but
it
was
his
duty
to
stay
yet
awhile
he
answered
precisely
in
monosyllables
when
he
left
he
winced
with
confusion
he
was
glad
it
was
finished
he
got
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
he
wanted
still
more
intensely
to
go
right
away
to
canada
miss
louisa
suffered
in
her
soul
indignant
with
all
of
them
with
him
too
but
quite
unable
to
say
why
she
was
indignant
xiii
two
evenings
after
louisa
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
quarry
cottage
at
six
he
had
finished
dinner
the
woman
had
washed
up
and
gone
away
but
still
he
sat
in
his
pit
dirt
he
was
going
later
to
the
new
inn
he
had
begun
to
go
there
because
he
must
go
somewhere
the
mere
contact
with
other
men
was
necessary
to
him
the
noise
the
warmth
the
forgetful
flight
of
the
hours
but
still
he
did
not
move
he
sat
alone
in
the
empty
house
till
it
began
to
grow
on
him
like
something
unnatural
he
was
in
his
pit
dirt
when
he
opened
the
door
i
have
been
wanting
to
thought
i
would
she
said
and
she
went
to
the
sofa
he
wondered
why
she
would
use
his
mother
round
armchair
yet
something
stirred
in
him
like
anger
when
the
housekeeper
placed
herself
in
it
i
ought
to
have
been
washed
by
now
he
said
glancing
at
the
clock
which
was
adorned
with
butterflies
and
cherries
and
the
name
of
t
brooks
he
laid
his
black
hands
along
his
mottled
dirty
arms
louisa
looked
at
him
there
was
the
reserve
and
the
simple
neutrality
towards
her
which
she
dreaded
in
him
it
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
approach
him
i
am
afraid
she
said
that
i
was
kind
in
asking
you
to
i
not
used
to
it
he
said
smiling
with
his
mouth
showing
the
interspaced
white
teeth
his
eyes
however
were
steady
and
unseeing
it
not
that
she
said
hastily
her
repose
was
exquisite
and
her
dark
grey
eyes
rich
with
understanding
he
felt
afraid
of
her
as
she
sat
there
as
he
began
to
grow
conscious
of
her
how
do
you
get
on
alone
she
asked
he
glanced
away
to
the
fire
he
answered
shifting
uneasily
not
finishing
his
answer
her
face
settled
heavily
how
close
it
is
in
this
room
you
have
such
immense
fires
i
will
take
off
my
coat
she
said
he
watched
her
take
off
her
hat
and
coat
she
wore
a
cream
cashmir
blouse
embroidered
with
gold
silk
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
fine
garment
fitting
her
throat
and
wrists
close
it
gave
him
a
feeling
of
pleasure
and
cleanness
and
relief
from
himself
what
were
you
thinking
about
that
you
did
get
washed
she
asked
half
intimately
he
laughed
turning
aside
his
head
the
whites
of
his
eyes
showed
very
distinct
in
his
black
face
oh
he
said
i
could
tell
there
was
a
pause
are
you
going
to
keep
this
house
on
she
asked
he
stirred
in
his
chair
under
the
question
i
hardly
know
he
said
i
very
likely
going
to
her
spirit
became
very
quiet
and
attentive
what
for
she
asked
again
he
shifted
restlessly
on
his
seat
well
said
to
try
the
but
which
life
there
various
or
lumbering
or
mining
i
do
mind
much
what
it
and
is
that
what
you
want
he
did
not
think
in
these
times
so
he
could
not
answer
i
do
know
he
said
till
i
she
saw
him
drawing
away
from
her
for
ever
are
you
sorry
to
leave
this
house
and
garden
she
asked
i
do
know
he
answered
reluctantly
i
suppose
our
fred
would
come
what
he
you
do
want
to
settle
down
she
asked
he
was
leaning
forward
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
he
turned
to
her
her
face
was
pale
and
set
it
looked
heavy
and
impassive
her
hair
shone
richer
as
she
grew
white
she
was
to
him
something
steady
and
immovable
and
eternal
presented
to
him
his
heart
was
hot
in
an
anguish
of
suspense
sharp
twitches
of
fear
and
pain
were
in
his
limbs
he
turned
his
whole
body
away
from
her
the
silence
was
unendurable
he
could
not
bear
her
to
sit
there
any
more
it
made
his
heart
go
hot
and
stifled
in
his
breast
were
you
going
out
tonight
she
asked
only
to
the
new
inn
he
said
again
there
was
silence
she
reached
for
her
hat
nothing
else
was
suggested
to
her
she
had
to
go
he
sat
waiting
for
her
to
be
gone
for
relief
and
she
knew
that
if
she
went
out
of
that
house
as
she
was
she
went
out
a
failure
yet
she
continued
to
pin
on
her
hat
in
a
moment
she
would
have
to
go
something
was
carrying
her
then
suddenly
a
sharp
pang
like
lightning
seared
her
from
head
to
foot
and
she
was
beyond
herself
do
you
want
me
to
go
she
asked
controlled
yet
speaking
out
of
a
fiery
anguish
as
if
the
words
were
spoken
from
her
without
her
intervention
he
went
white
under
his
dirt
why
he
asked
turning
to
her
in
fear
compelled
do
you
want
me
to
go
she
repeated
why
he
asked
again
because
i
wanted
to
stay
with
you
she
said
suffocated
with
her
lungs
full
of
fire
his
face
worked
he
hung
forward
a
little
suspended
staring
straight
into
her
eyes
in
torment
in
an
agony
of
chaos
unable
to
collect
himself
and
as
if
turned
to
stone
she
looked
back
into
his
eyes
their
souls
were
exposed
bare
for
a
few
moments
it
was
agony
they
could
not
bear
it
he
dropped
his
head
whilst
his
body
jerked
with
little
sharp
twitchings
she
turned
away
for
her
coat
her
soul
had
gone
dead
in
her
her
hands
trembled
but
she
could
not
feel
any
more
she
drew
on
her
coat
there
was
a
cruel
suspense
in
the
room
the
moment
had
come
for
her
to
go
he
lifted
his
head
his
eyes
were
like
agate
expressionless
save
for
the
black
points
of
torture
they
held
her
she
had
no
will
no
life
any
more
she
felt
broken
do
you
want
me
she
said
helplessly
a
spasm
of
torture
crossed
his
eyes
which
held
her
fixed
he
began
but
he
could
not
speak
something
drew
him
from
his
chair
to
her
she
stood
motionless
spellbound
like
a
creature
given
up
as
prey
he
put
his
hand
tentatively
uncertainly
on
her
arm
the
expression
of
his
face
was
strange
and
inhuman
she
stood
utterly
motionless
then
clumsily
he
put
his
arms
round
her
and
took
her
cruelly
blindly
straining
her
till
she
nearly
lost
consciousness
till
he
himself
had
almost
fallen
then
gradually
as
he
held
her
gripped
and
his
brain
reeled
round
and
he
felt
himself
falling
falling
from
himself
and
whilst
she
yielded
up
swooned
to
a
kind
of
death
of
herself
a
moment
of
utter
darkness
came
over
him
and
they
began
to
wake
up
again
as
if
from
a
long
sleep
he
was
himself
after
a
while
his
arms
slackened
she
loosened
herself
a
little
and
put
her
arms
round
him
as
he
held
her
so
they
held
each
other
close
and
hid
each
against
the
other
for
assurance
helpless
in
speech
and
it
was
ever
her
hands
that
trembled
more
closely
upon
him
drawing
him
nearer
into
her
with
love
and
at
last
she
drew
back
her
face
and
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
wet
and
shining
with
light
his
heart
which
saw
was
silent
with
fear
he
was
with
her
she
saw
his
face
all
sombre
and
inscrutable
and
he
seemed
eternal
to
her
and
all
the
echo
of
pain
came
back
into
the
rarity
of
bliss
and
all
her
tears
came
up
i
love
you
she
said
her
lips
drawn
and
sobbing
he
put
down
his
head
against
her
unable
to
hear
her
unable
to
bear
the
sudden
coming
of
the
peace
and
passion
that
almost
broke
his
heart
they
stood
together
in
silence
whilst
the
thing
moved
away
a
little
at
last
she
wanted
to
see
him
she
looked
up
his
eyes
were
strange
and
glowing
with
a
tiny
black
pupil
strange
they
were
and
powerful
over
her
and
his
mouth
came
to
hers
and
slowly
her
eyelids
closed
as
his
mouth
sought
hers
closer
and
closer
and
took
possession
of
her
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
too
much
mixed
up
with
passion
and
grief
and
death
to
do
anything
but
hold
each
other
in
pain
and
kiss
with
long
hurting
kisses
wherein
fear
was
transfused
into
desire
at
last
she
disengaged
herself
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
were
hurt
but
glad
and
he
scarcely
dared
look
at
her
i
glad
she
said
also
he
held
her
hands
in
passionate
gratitude
and
desire
he
had
not
yet
the
presence
of
mind
to
say
anything
he
was
dazed
with
relief
i
ought
to
go
she
said
he
looked
at
her
he
could
not
grasp
the
thought
of
her
going
he
knew
he
could
never
be
separated
from
her
any
more
yet
he
dared
not
assert
himself
he
held
her
hands
tight
your
face
is
black
she
said
he
laughed
yours
is
a
bit
smudged
he
said
they
were
afraid
of
each
other
afraid
to
talk
he
could
only
keep
her
near
to
him
after
a
while
she
wanted
to
wash
her
face
he
brought
her
some
warm
water
standing
by
and
watching
her
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
say
that
he
dared
not
he
watched
her
wiping
her
face
and
making
tidy
her
hair
they
see
your
blouse
is
dirty
he
said
she
looked
at
her
sleeves
and
laughed
for
joy
he
was
sharp
with
pride
what
shall
you
do
he
asked
how
she
said
he
was
awkward
at
a
reply
about
me
he
said
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
she
laughed
he
put
his
hand
out
slowly
to
her
what
did
it
matter
but
make
yourself
clean
she
said
xiv
as
they
went
up
the
hill
the
night
seemed
dense
with
the
unknown
they
kept
close
together
feeling
as
if
the
darkness
were
alive
and
full
of
knowledge
all
around
them
in
silence
they
walked
up
the
hill
at
first
the
street
lamps
went
their
way
several
people
passed
them
he
was
more
shy
than
she
and
would
have
let
her
go
had
she
loosened
in
the
least
but
she
held
firm
then
they
came
into
the
true
darkness
between
the
fields
they
did
not
want
to
speak
feeling
closer
together
in
silence
so
they
arrived
at
the
vicarage
gate
they
stood
under
the
naked
tree
i
wish
you
did
have
to
go
he
said
she
laughed
a
quick
little
laugh
come
tomorrow
she
said
in
a
low
tone
and
ask
she
felt
his
hand
close
on
hers
she
gave
the
same
sorrowful
little
laugh
of
sympathy
then
she
kissed
him
sending
him
home
at
home
the
old
grief
came
on
in
another
paroxysm
obliterating
louisa
obliterating
even
his
mother
for
whom
the
stress
was
raging
like
a
burst
of
fever
in
a
wound
but
something
was
sound
in
his
heart
xv
the
next
evening
he
dressed
to
go
to
the
vicarage
feeling
it
was
to
be
done
not
imagining
what
it
would
be
like
he
would
not
take
this
seriously
he
was
sure
of
louisa
and
this
marriage
was
like
fate
to
him
it
filled
him
also
with
a
blessed
feeling
of
fatality
he
was
not
responsible
neither
had
her
people
anything
really
to
do
with
it
they
ushered
him
into
the
little
study
which
was
fireless
by
and
by
the
vicar
came
in
his
voice
was
cold
and
hostile
as
he
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
young
man
he
knew
already
without
asking
durant
looked
up
at
him
again
like
a
sailor
before
a
superior
he
had
the
subordinate
manner
yet
his
spirit
was
clear
i
wanted
mr
he
began
respectfully
then
all
the
colour
suddenly
left
his
face
it
seemed
now
a
violation
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
what
was
he
doing
there
but
he
stood
on
because
it
had
to
be
done
he
held
firmly
to
his
own
independence
and
he
must
not
be
indecisive
he
must
put
himself
aside
the
matter
was
bigger
than
just
his
personal
self
he
must
not
feel
this
was
his
highest
duty
you
said
the
vicar
durant
mouth
was
dry
but
he
answered
with
steadiness
miss
to
marry
you
asked
miss
louisa
if
she
would
marry
corrected
the
vicar
durant
reflected
he
had
not
asked
her
this
if
she
would
marry
me
sir
i
hope
he
smiled
he
was
a
man
and
the
vicar
could
not
help
seeing
it
and
my
daughter
was
willing
to
marry
you
said
mr
lindley
yes
said
durant
seriously
it
was
pain
to
him
nevertheless
he
felt
the
natural
hostility
between
himself
and
the
elder
man
will
you
come
this
way
said
the
vicar
he
led
into
the
where
were
mary
louisa
and
mrs
lindley
mr
massy
sat
in
a
corner
with
a
lamp
this
young
man
has
come
on
your
account
louisa
said
mr
lindley
yes
said
louisa
her
eyes
on
durant
who
stood
erect
in
discipline
he
dared
not
look
at
her
but
he
was
aware
of
her
you
do
want
to
marry
a
collier
you
little
fool
cried
mrs
lindley
harshly
she
lay
obese
and
helpless
upon
the
couch
swathed
in
a
loose
gown
oh
hush
mother
cried
mary
with
quiet
intensity
and
pride
what
means
have
you
to
support
a
wife
demanded
the
vicar
wife
roughly
i
durant
replied
starting
i
think
i
can
earn
well
and
how
much
came
the
rough
voice
seven
and
six
a
day
replied
the
young
man
and
will
it
get
to
be
any
more
i
hope
and
are
you
going
to
live
in
that
poky
little
house
i
think
so
said
durant
if
it
all
he
took
small
offence
only
was
upset
because
they
would
not
think
him
good
enough
he
knew
that
in
their
sense
he
was
not
then
she
a
fool
i
tell
you
if
she
marries
you
cried
the
mother
roughly
casting
her
decision
after
all
mama
it
is
louisa
affair
said
mary
distinctly
and
we
must
as
she
makes
her
bed
she
must
she
repent
it
interrupted
mrs
lindley
and
after
all
said
mr
lindley
louisa
can
not
quite
hold
herself
free
to
act
entirely
without
consideration
for
her
what
do
you
want
papa
asked
louisa
sharply
i
mean
that
if
you
marry
this
man
it
will
make
my
position
very
difficult
for
me
particularly
if
you
stay
in
this
parish
if
you
were
moving
quite
away
it
would
be
simpler
but
living
here
in
a
cottage
under
my
nose
as
it
would
be
almost
unseemly
i
have
my
position
to
maintain
and
a
position
which
may
not
be
taken
come
over
here
young
man
cried
the
mother
in
her
rough
voice
and
let
us
look
at
durant
flushing
went
over
and
quite
at
attention
so
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
miss
louisa
was
angry
to
see
him
standing
there
obedient
and
acquiescent
he
ought
to
show
himself
a
man
ca
you
take
her
away
and
live
out
of
sight
said
the
mother
both
of
you
be
better
yes
we
can
go
away
he
said
do
you
want
to
asked
miss
mary
clearly
he
faced
round
mary
looked
very
stately
and
impressive
he
flushed
i
do
if
it
going
to
be
a
trouble
to
anybody
he
said
for
yourself
you
would
rather
stay
said
mary
it
my
home
he
said
and
that
the
house
i
was
born
then
turned
clearly
to
her
parents
i
really
do
see
how
you
can
make
the
conditions
papa
he
has
his
own
rights
and
if
louisa
wants
to
marry
louisa
louisa
cried
the
father
impatiently
i
can
not
understand
why
louisa
should
not
behave
in
the
normal
way
i
can
not
see
why
she
should
only
think
of
herself
and
leave
her
family
out
of
count
the
thing
is
enough
in
itself
and
she
ought
to
try
to
ameliorate
it
as
much
as
possible
and
but
i
love
the
man
papa
said
louisa
and
i
hope
you
love
your
parents
and
i
hope
you
want
to
spare
them
as
much
of
loss
of
prestige
as
we
can
go
away
to
live
said
louisa
her
face
breaking
to
tears
at
last
she
was
really
hurt
oh
yes
easily
durant
replied
hastily
pale
distressed
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
i
think
it
would
really
be
better
murmured
the
vicar
mollified
very
likely
it
would
said
the
invalid
though
i
think
we
ought
to
apologize
for
asking
such
a
thing
said
mary
haughtily
no
said
durant
it
will
be
best
all
he
was
glad
there
was
no
more
bother
and
shall
we
put
up
the
banns
here
or
go
to
the
registrar
he
asked
clearly
like
a
challenge
we
will
go
to
the
registrar
replied
louisa
decidedly
again
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
well
if
you
will
have
your
own
way
you
must
go
your
own
way
said
the
mother
emphatically
all
the
time
mr
massy
had
sat
obscure
and
unnoticed
in
a
corner
of
the
room
at
this
juncture
he
got
up
saying
there
is
baby
mary
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
stately
her
little
husband
padded
after
her
durant
watched
the
fragile
small
man
go
wondering
and
where
asked
the
vicar
almost
genial
do
you
think
you
will
go
when
you
are
married
durant
started
i
was
thinking
of
emigrating
he
said
to
canada
or
where
i
think
to
yes
that
would
be
very
again
there
was
a
pause
we
sha
see
much
of
you
then
as
a
said
the
mother
roughly
but
amicably
not
much
he
said
then
he
took
his
leave
louisa
went
with
him
to
the
gate
she
stood
before
him
in
distress
you
wo
mind
them
will
you
she
said
humbly
i
do
mind
them
if
they
do
mind
me
he
said
then
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
let
us
be
married
soon
she
murmured
in
tears
all
right
he
said
i
go
tomorrow
to
a
fragment
of
stained
glass
beauvale
is
or
was
the
largest
parish
in
england
it
is
thinly
populated
only
just
netting
the
stragglers
from
shoals
of
houses
in
three
large
mining
villages
for
the
rest
it
holds
a
great
tract
of
woodland
fragment
of
old
sherwood
a
few
hills
of
pasture
and
arable
land
three
collieries
and
finally
the
ruins
of
a
cistercian
abbey
these
ruins
lie
in
a
still
rich
meadow
at
the
foot
of
the
last
fall
of
woodland
through
whose
oaks
shines
a
blue
of
hyacinths
like
water
in
maytime
of
the
abbey
there
remains
only
the
east
wall
of
the
chancel
standing
a
wild
thick
mass
of
ivy
weighting
one
shoulder
while
pigeons
perch
in
the
tracery
of
the
lofty
window
this
is
the
window
in
question
the
vicar
of
beauvale
is
a
bachelor
of
years
quite
early
in
life
some
illness
caused
a
slight
paralysis
of
his
right
side
so
that
he
drags
a
little
and
so
that
the
right
corner
of
his
mouth
is
twisted
up
into
his
cheek
with
a
constant
grimace
unhidden
by
a
heavy
moustache
there
is
something
pathetic
about
this
twist
on
the
countenance
his
eyes
are
so
shrewd
and
sad
it
would
be
hard
to
get
near
to
mr
colbran
indeed
now
his
soul
had
some
of
the
twist
of
his
face
so
that
when
he
is
not
ironical
he
is
satiric
yet
a
man
of
more
complete
tolerance
and
generosity
scarcely
exists
let
the
boors
mock
him
he
merely
smiles
on
the
other
side
and
there
is
no
malice
in
his
eyes
only
a
quiet
expression
of
waiting
till
they
have
finished
his
people
do
not
like
him
yet
none
could
bring
forth
an
accusation
against
him
save
that
you
never
can
tell
when
he
having
i
dined
the
other
evening
with
the
vicar
in
his
study
the
room
scandalizes
the
neighbourhood
because
of
the
statuary
which
adorns
it
a
laocoön
and
other
classic
copies
with
bronze
and
silver
italian
renaissance
work
for
the
rest
it
is
all
dark
and
tawny
mr
colbran
is
an
archaeologist
he
does
not
take
himself
seriously
however
in
his
hobby
so
that
nobody
knows
the
worth
of
his
opinions
on
the
subject
here
you
are
he
said
to
me
after
dinner
i
found
another
paragraph
for
my
great
what
that
i
asked
have
i
told
you
i
was
compiling
a
bible
of
the
english
bible
of
their
exclamations
in
presence
of
the
unknown
i
found
a
fragment
at
home
a
jump
at
god
from
where
i
asked
startled
the
vicar
closed
his
eyes
whilst
looking
at
me
only
on
parchment
he
said
then
slowly
he
reached
for
a
yellow
book
and
read
translating
as
he
went
then
while
we
chanted
came
a
crackling
at
the
window
at
the
great
east
window
where
hung
our
lord
on
the
cross
it
was
a
malicious
covetous
devil
wrathed
by
us
rended
the
lovely
image
of
the
glass
we
saw
the
iron
clutches
of
the
fiend
pick
the
window
and
a
face
flaming
red
like
fire
in
a
basket
did
glower
down
on
us
our
hearts
melted
away
our
legs
broke
we
thought
to
die
the
breath
of
the
wretch
filled
the
chapel
but
our
dear
saint
came
hastening
down
heaven
to
defend
us
the
fiend
began
to
groan
and
was
daunted
and
beat
off
when
the
sun
uprose
and
it
was
morning
some
went
out
in
dread
upon
the
thin
snow
there
the
figure
of
our
saint
was
broken
and
thrown
down
whilst
in
the
window
was
a
wicked
hole
as
from
the
holy
wounds
the
blessed
blood
was
run
out
at
the
touch
of
the
fiend
and
on
the
snow
was
the
blood
sparkling
like
gold
some
gathered
it
up
for
the
joy
of
this
house
interesting
i
said
where
it
from
beauvale
beauvale
abbey
i
said
they
were
only
very
few
the
monks
what
frightened
them
i
i
wonder
he
repeated
somebody
climbed
up
i
supposed
and
attempted
to
get
what
he
exclaimed
smiling
well
what
do
you
think
pretty
much
the
same
he
replied
i
glossed
it
out
for
my
your
great
work
tell
he
put
a
shade
over
the
lamp
so
that
the
room
was
almost
in
darkness
am
i
more
than
a
voice
he
asked
i
can
see
your
hand
i
replied
he
moved
entirely
from
the
circle
of
light
then
his
voice
began
sardonic
i
was
a
serf
in
rollestoun
newthorpe
manor
master
of
the
stables
i
was
one
day
a
horse
bit
me
as
i
was
grooming
him
he
was
an
old
enemy
of
mine
i
fetched
him
a
blow
across
the
nose
then
when
he
got
a
chance
he
lashed
out
at
me
and
caught
me
a
gash
over
the
mouth
i
snatched
at
a
hatchet
and
cut
his
head
he
yelled
fiend
as
he
was
and
strained
for
me
with
all
his
teeth
bare
i
brought
him
down
for
killing
him
they
flogged
me
till
they
thought
i
was
dead
i
was
sturdy
because
we
got
plenty
to
eat
i
was
sturdy
but
they
flogged
me
till
i
did
not
move
the
next
night
i
set
fire
to
the
stables
and
the
stables
set
fire
to
the
house
i
watched
and
saw
the
red
flame
rise
and
look
out
of
the
window
i
saw
the
folk
running
each
for
himself
master
no
more
than
one
of
a
frightened
party
it
was
freezing
but
the
heat
made
me
sweat
i
saw
them
all
turn
again
to
watch
all
rimmed
with
red
they
cried
all
of
them
when
the
roof
went
in
when
the
sparks
splashed
up
at
rebound
they
cried
then
like
dogs
at
the
bagpipes
howling
master
cursed
me
till
i
laughed
as
i
lay
under
a
bush
quite
near
as
the
fire
went
down
i
got
frightened
i
ran
for
the
woods
with
fire
blazing
in
my
eyes
and
crackling
in
my
ears
for
hours
i
was
all
fire
then
i
went
to
sleep
under
the
bracken
when
i
woke
it
was
evening
i
had
no
mantle
was
frozen
stiff
i
was
afraid
to
move
lest
all
the
sores
of
my
back
should
be
broken
like
thin
ice
i
lay
still
until
i
could
bear
my
hunger
no
longer
i
moved
then
to
get
used
to
the
pain
of
movement
when
i
began
to
hunt
for
food
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
but
hips
after
wandering
about
till
i
was
faint
i
dropped
again
in
the
bracken
the
boughs
above
me
creaked
with
frost
i
started
and
looked
round
the
branches
were
like
hair
among
the
starlight
my
heart
stood
still
again
there
was
a
creak
creak
and
suddenly
a
whoop
that
whistled
in
fading
i
fell
down
in
the
bracken
like
dead
wood
yet
by
the
peculiar
whistling
sound
at
the
end
i
knew
it
was
only
the
ice
bending
or
tightening
in
the
frost
i
was
in
the
woods
above
the
lake
only
two
miles
from
the
manor
and
yet
when
the
lake
whooped
hollowly
again
i
clutched
the
frozen
soil
every
one
of
my
muscles
as
stiff
as
the
stiff
earth
so
all
the
night
long
i
dare
not
move
my
face
but
pressed
it
flat
down
and
taut
i
lay
as
if
pegged
down
and
braced
when
morning
came
still
i
did
not
move
i
lay
still
in
a
dream
by
afternoon
my
ache
was
such
it
enlivened
me
i
cried
rocking
my
breath
in
the
ache
of
moving
then
again
i
became
fierce
i
beat
my
hands
on
the
rough
bark
to
hurt
them
so
that
i
should
not
ache
so
much
in
such
a
rage
i
was
i
swung
my
limbs
to
torture
till
i
fell
sick
with
pain
yet
i
fought
the
hurt
fought
it
and
fought
by
twisting
and
flinging
myself
until
it
was
overcome
then
the
evening
began
to
draw
on
all
day
the
sun
had
not
loosened
the
frost
i
felt
the
sky
chill
again
towards
afternoon
then
i
knew
the
night
was
coming
and
remembering
the
great
space
i
had
just
come
through
horrible
so
that
it
seemed
to
have
made
me
another
man
i
fled
across
the
wood
but
in
my
running
i
came
upon
the
oak
where
hanged
five
bodies
there
they
must
hang
night
after
night
it
was
a
terror
worse
than
any
turning
blundering
through
the
forest
i
came
out
where
the
trees
thinned
where
only
hawthorns
ragged
and
shaggy
went
down
to
the
lake
edge
the
sky
across
was
red
the
ice
on
the
water
glistened
as
if
it
were
warm
a
few
wild
geese
sat
out
like
stones
on
the
sheet
of
ice
i
thought
of
martha
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
miller
at
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
her
hair
was
red
like
beech
leaves
in
a
wind
when
i
had
gone
often
to
the
mill
with
the
horses
she
had
brought
me
food
thought
said
i
to
her
a
squirrel
sat
on
your
shoulder
is
your
hair
fallen
loose
call
me
the
fox
she
said
i
were
your
dog
said
i
she
would
bring
me
bacon
and
good
bread
when
i
called
at
the
mill
with
the
horses
the
thought
of
cakes
of
bread
and
of
bacon
made
me
reel
as
if
drunk
i
had
torn
at
the
rabbit
holes
i
had
chewed
wood
all
day
in
such
a
dimness
was
my
head
that
i
felt
neither
the
soreness
of
my
wounds
nor
the
cuts
of
thorns
on
my
knees
but
stumbled
towards
the
mill
almost
past
fear
of
man
and
death
panting
with
fear
of
the
darkness
that
crept
behind
me
from
trunk
to
trunk
coming
to
the
gap
in
the
wood
below
which
lay
the
pond
i
heard
no
sound
always
i
knew
the
place
filled
with
the
buzz
of
water
but
now
it
was
silent
in
fear
of
this
stillness
i
ran
forward
forgetting
myself
forgetting
the
frost
the
wood
seemed
to
pursue
me
i
fell
just
in
time
down
by
a
shed
wherein
were
housed
the
few
wintry
pigs
the
miller
came
riding
in
on
his
horse
and
the
barking
of
dogs
was
for
him
i
heard
him
curse
the
day
curse
his
servant
curse
me
whom
he
had
been
out
to
hunt
in
his
rage
of
wasted
labour
curse
all
as
i
lay
i
heard
inside
the
shed
a
sucking
then
i
knew
that
the
sow
was
there
and
that
the
most
of
her
sucking
pigs
would
be
already
killed
for
christmas
the
miller
from
forethought
to
have
young
at
that
time
made
profit
by
his
sucking
pigs
that
were
sold
for
the
feast
when
in
a
moment
all
was
silent
in
the
dusk
i
broke
the
bar
and
came
into
the
shed
the
sow
grunted
but
did
not
come
forth
to
discover
me
by
and
by
i
crept
in
towards
her
warmth
she
had
but
three
young
left
which
now
angered
her
she
being
too
full
of
milk
every
now
and
again
she
slashed
at
them
and
they
squealed
busy
as
she
was
with
them
i
in
the
darkness
advanced
towards
her
i
trembled
so
that
scarce
dared
i
trust
myself
near
her
for
long
dared
not
put
my
naked
face
towards
her
shuddering
with
hunger
and
fear
i
at
last
fed
of
her
guarding
my
face
with
my
arm
her
own
full
young
tumbled
squealing
against
me
but
she
feeling
her
ease
lay
grunting
at
last
i
too
lay
drunk
swooning
i
was
roused
by
the
shouting
of
the
miller
he
angered
by
his
daughter
who
wept
abused
her
driving
her
from
the
house
to
feed
the
swine
she
came
bowing
under
a
yoke
to
the
door
of
the
shed
finding
the
pin
broken
she
stood
afraid
then
as
the
sow
grunted
she
came
cautiously
in
i
took
her
with
my
arm
my
hand
over
her
mouth
as
she
struggled
against
my
breast
my
heart
began
to
beat
loudly
at
last
she
knew
it
was
i
clasped
her
she
hung
in
my
arms
turning
away
her
face
so
that
i
kissed
her
throat
the
tears
blinded
my
eyes
i
know
not
why
unless
it
were
the
hurt
of
my
mouth
wounded
by
the
horse
was
keen
will
kill
you
she
whispered
i
answered
and
she
wept
softly
she
took
my
head
in
her
arms
and
kissed
me
wetting
me
with
her
tears
brushing
me
with
her
keen
hair
warming
me
through
will
not
go
away
from
here
i
said
me
a
knife
and
i
will
defend
myself
she
wept
no
when
she
went
i
lay
down
pressing
my
chest
where
she
had
rested
on
the
earth
lest
being
alone
were
worse
emptiness
than
hunger
later
she
came
again
i
saw
her
bend
in
the
doorway
a
lanthorn
hanging
in
front
as
she
peered
under
the
redness
of
her
falling
hair
i
was
afraid
of
her
but
she
came
with
food
we
sat
together
in
the
dull
light
sometimes
still
i
shivered
and
my
throat
would
not
swallow
said
i
eat
all
this
you
have
brought
me
i
shall
sleep
till
somebody
finds
me
then
she
took
away
the
rest
of
the
meat
said
i
i
not
eat
she
looked
at
me
in
tears
of
fear
i
said
but
still
she
had
no
answer
i
kissed
her
and
the
hurt
of
my
wounded
mouth
angered
me
there
is
my
blood
said
i
your
mouth
wiping
her
smooth
hand
over
her
lips
she
looked
thereat
then
at
me
me
i
said
am
tired
she
rose
to
leave
me
bring
a
knife
i
said
then
she
held
the
lanthorn
near
my
face
looking
as
at
a
picture
look
to
me
she
said
a
stirk
that
is
roped
for
the
axe
your
eyes
are
dark
but
they
are
wide
open
i
will
sleep
said
i
will
not
wake
too
late
not
stay
here
she
said
will
not
sleep
in
the
wood
i
answered
and
it
was
my
heart
that
spoke
i
am
afraid
i
had
better
be
afraid
of
the
voice
of
man
and
dogs
than
the
sounds
in
the
woods
bring
me
a
knife
and
in
the
morning
i
will
go
alone
will
i
not
go
now
searchers
will
take
you
she
said
me
a
knife
i
answered
go
she
wept
will
with
that
she
lifted
the
lanthorn
lit
up
her
own
face
and
mine
her
blue
eyes
dried
of
tears
then
i
took
her
to
myself
knowing
she
was
mine
will
come
again
she
said
she
went
and
i
folded
my
arms
lay
down
and
slept
when
i
woke
she
was
rocking
me
wildly
to
rouse
me
dreamed
said
i
a
great
heap
as
if
it
were
a
hill
lay
on
me
and
above
me
she
put
a
cloak
over
me
gave
me
a
and
a
wallet
of
food
and
other
things
i
did
not
note
then
under
her
own
cloak
she
hid
the
lanthorn
us
go
she
said
and
blindly
i
followed
her
when
i
came
out
into
the
cold
someone
touched
my
face
and
my
hair
i
cried
then
she
swiftly
clung
to
me
hushed
me
has
touched
me
i
said
aloud
still
dazed
with
sleep
hush
she
wept
snowing
the
dogs
within
the
house
began
to
bark
she
fled
forward
i
after
her
coming
to
the
ford
of
the
stream
she
ran
swiftly
over
but
i
broke
through
the
ice
then
i
knew
where
i
was
snowflakes
fine
and
rapid
were
biting
at
my
face
in
the
wood
there
was
no
wind
nor
snow
said
i
to
her
for
i
am
locked
up
with
sleep
hear
roaring
overhead
she
answered
hear
in
the
trees
like
great
bats
squeaking
me
your
hand
said
i
we
heard
many
noises
as
we
passed
once
as
there
uprose
a
whiteness
before
us
she
cried
aloud
said
i
not
untie
thy
hand
from
mine
and
soon
we
were
crossing
fallen
snow
but
ever
and
again
she
started
back
from
fear
you
draw
back
my
arm
i
said
angry
loosen
a
weal
on
my
shoulder
thereafter
she
ran
by
my
side
like
a
fawn
beside
its
mother
will
cross
the
valley
and
gain
the
stream
i
said
will
lead
us
on
its
ice
as
on
a
path
deep
into
the
forest
there
we
can
join
the
outlaws
the
wolves
are
driven
from
this
part
they
have
followed
the
driven
deer
we
came
directly
on
a
large
gleam
that
shaped
itself
up
among
flying
grains
of
snow
she
cried
and
she
stood
amazed
then
i
thought
we
had
gone
through
the
bounds
into
faery
realm
and
i
was
no
more
a
man
how
did
i
know
what
eyes
were
gleaming
at
me
between
the
snow
what
cunning
spirits
in
the
draughts
of
air
so
i
waited
for
what
would
happen
and
i
forgot
her
that
she
was
there
only
i
could
feel
the
spirits
whirling
and
blowing
about
me
whereupon
she
clung
upon
me
kissing
me
lavishly
and
were
dogs
or
men
or
demons
come
upon
us
at
that
moment
she
had
let
us
be
stricken
down
nor
heeded
not
so
we
moved
forward
to
the
shadow
that
shone
in
colours
upon
the
passing
snow
we
found
ourselves
under
a
door
of
light
which
shed
its
colours
mixed
with
snow
this
martha
had
never
seen
nor
i
this
door
open
for
a
red
and
brave
issuing
like
fires
we
wondered
is
faery
she
said
and
after
a
while
one
catch
ah
no
through
the
snow
shone
bunches
of
red
and
blue
one
have
such
a
little
light
like
a
red
a
little
like
a
scarlet
on
one
breast
one
were
singled
out
as
our
lady
i
flung
off
my
cloak
and
my
burden
to
climb
up
the
face
of
the
shadow
standing
on
rims
of
stone
then
in
pockets
of
snow
i
reached
upward
my
hand
was
red
and
blue
but
i
could
not
take
the
stuff
like
colour
of
a
moth
wing
it
was
on
my
hand
it
flew
on
the
increasing
snow
i
stood
higher
on
the
head
of
a
frozen
man
reached
higher
my
hand
then
i
felt
the
bright
stuff
cold
i
could
not
pluck
it
off
down
below
she
cried
to
me
to
come
again
to
her
i
felt
a
rib
that
yielded
i
struck
at
it
with
my
knife
there
came
a
gap
in
the
redness
looking
through
i
saw
below
as
it
were
white
stunted
angels
with
sad
faces
lifted
in
fear
two
faces
they
had
each
and
round
rings
of
hair
i
was
afraid
i
grasped
the
shining
red
i
pulled
then
the
cold
man
under
me
sank
so
i
fell
as
if
broken
on
to
the
snow
soon
i
was
risen
again
and
we
were
running
downwards
towards
the
stream
we
felt
ourselves
eased
when
the
smooth
road
of
ice
was
beneath
us
for
a
while
it
was
resting
to
travel
thus
evenly
but
the
wind
blew
round
us
the
snow
hung
upon
us
we
leaned
us
this
way
and
that
towards
the
storm
i
drew
her
along
for
she
came
as
a
bird
that
stems
lifting
and
swaying
against
the
wind
by
and
by
the
snow
came
smaller
there
was
not
wind
in
the
wood
then
i
felt
nor
labour
nor
cold
only
i
knew
the
darkness
drifted
by
on
either
side
that
overhead
was
a
lane
of
paleness
where
a
moon
fled
us
before
still
i
can
feel
the
moon
fleeing
from
me
can
feel
the
trees
passing
round
me
in
slow
dizzy
reel
can
feel
the
hurt
of
my
shoulder
and
my
straight
arm
torn
with
holding
her
i
was
following
the
moon
and
the
stream
for
i
knew
where
the
water
peeped
from
its
burrow
in
the
ground
there
were
shelters
of
the
outlaw
but
she
fell
without
sound
or
sign
i
gathered
her
up
and
climbed
the
bank
there
all
round
me
hissed
the
larchwood
dry
beneath
and
laced
with
its
cords
for
a
little
way
i
carried
her
into
the
trees
then
i
laid
her
down
till
i
cut
flat
hairy
boughs
i
put
her
in
my
bosom
on
this
dry
bed
so
we
swooned
together
through
the
night
i
laced
her
round
and
covered
her
with
myself
so
she
lay
like
a
nut
within
its
shell
again
when
morning
came
it
was
pain
of
cold
that
woke
me
i
groaned
but
my
heart
was
warm
as
i
saw
the
heap
of
red
hair
in
my
arms
as
i
looked
at
her
her
eyes
opened
into
mine
she
out
of
her
smile
came
fear
as
if
in
a
trap
she
pressed
back
her
head
have
no
flint
said
i
the
wallet
flint
and
steel
and
tinder
box
she
answered
yield
you
blessing
i
said
in
a
place
a
little
open
i
kindled
a
fire
of
larch
boughs
she
was
afraid
of
me
hovering
near
yet
never
crossing
a
space
said
i
us
eat
this
food
face
she
said
smeared
with
blood
i
opened
out
my
cloak
come
said
i
are
frosted
with
cold
i
took
a
handful
of
snow
in
my
hand
wiping
my
face
with
it
which
then
i
dried
on
my
cloak
face
is
no
longer
painted
with
blood
you
are
no
longer
afraid
of
me
come
here
then
sit
by
me
while
we
eat
but
as
i
cut
the
cold
bread
for
her
she
clasped
me
suddenly
kissing
me
she
fell
before
me
clasped
my
knees
to
her
breast
weeping
she
laid
her
face
down
to
my
feet
so
that
her
hair
spread
like
a
fire
before
me
i
wondered
at
the
woman
i
cried
at
that
she
lifted
her
face
to
me
from
below
i
cried
feeling
my
tears
fall
with
her
head
on
my
breast
my
own
tears
rose
from
their
source
wetting
my
cheek
and
her
hair
which
was
wet
with
the
rain
of
my
eyes
then
i
remembered
and
took
from
my
bosom
the
coloured
light
of
that
night
before
i
saw
it
was
black
and
rough
said
i
is
magic
black
stone
she
wondered
is
the
red
light
of
the
night
before
i
said
is
magic
she
answered
i
throw
it
said
i
lifting
the
stone
i
throw
it
away
for
fear
shines
she
cried
looking
up
shines
like
the
eye
of
a
creature
at
night
the
eye
of
a
wolf
in
the
doorway
magic
i
said
me
throw
it
from
us
but
nay
she
held
my
arm
is
red
and
shining
she
cried
is
a
bloodstone
i
answered
will
hurt
us
we
shall
die
in
blood
give
it
to
me
she
answered
is
red
of
blood
i
said
give
it
to
me
she
called
is
my
blood
i
said
it
she
commanded
low
is
my
i
said
it
me
she
pleaded
gave
it
her
she
held
it
up
she
smiled
she
smiled
in
my
face
lifting
her
arms
to
me
i
took
her
with
my
mouth
her
mouth
her
white
throat
nor
she
ever
shrank
but
trembled
with
happiness
what
woke
us
when
the
woods
were
filling
again
with
shadow
when
the
fire
was
out
when
we
opened
our
eyes
and
looked
up
as
if
drowned
into
the
light
which
stood
bright
and
thick
on
the
what
woke
us
was
the
sound
of
wolves
nay
said
the
vicar
suddenly
rising
they
lived
happily
ever
no
i
said
the
shades
of
spring
i
it
was
a
mile
nearer
through
the
wood
mechanically
syson
turned
up
by
the
forge
and
lifted
the
the
blacksmith
and
his
mate
stood
still
watching
the
trespasser
but
syson
looked
too
much
a
gentleman
to
be
accosted
they
let
him
go
in
silence
across
the
small
field
to
the
wood
there
was
not
the
least
difference
between
this
morning
and
those
of
the
bright
springs
six
or
eight
years
back
white
and
fowls
still
scratched
round
the
gate
littering
the
earth
and
the
field
with
feathers
and
rubbish
between
the
two
thick
holly
bushes
in
the
was
the
hidden
gap
whose
fence
one
climbed
to
get
into
the
wood
the
bars
were
scored
just
the
same
by
the
keeper
boots
he
was
back
in
the
eternal
syson
was
extraordinarily
glad
like
an
uneasy
spirit
he
had
returned
to
the
country
of
his
past
and
he
found
it
waiting
for
him
unaltered
the
hazel
still
spread
glad
little
hands
downwards
the
bluebells
here
were
still
wan
and
few
among
the
lush
grass
and
in
shade
of
the
bushes
the
path
through
the
wood
on
the
very
brow
of
a
slope
ran
winding
easily
for
a
time
all
around
were
twiggy
oaks
just
issuing
their
gold
and
floor
spaces
diapered
with
woodruff
with
patches
of
and
tufts
of
hyacinth
two
fallen
trees
still
lay
across
the
track
syson
jolted
down
a
steep
rough
slope
and
came
again
upon
the
open
land
this
time
looking
north
as
through
a
great
window
in
the
wood
he
stayed
to
gaze
over
the
level
fields
of
the
at
the
village
which
strewed
the
bare
upland
as
if
it
had
tumbled
off
the
passing
waggons
of
industry
and
been
forsaken
there
was
a
stiff
modern
grey
little
church
and
blocks
and
rows
of
red
dwellings
lying
at
random
at
the
back
the
twinkling
headstocks
of
the
pit
and
the
looming
all
was
naked
and
not
a
tree
it
was
quite
unaltered
syson
turned
satisfied
to
follow
the
path
that
sheered
downhill
into
the
wood
he
was
curiously
elated
feeling
himself
back
in
an
enduring
vision
he
started
a
keeper
was
standing
a
few
yards
in
front
barring
the
way
where
might
you
be
going
this
road
sir
asked
the
man
the
tone
of
his
question
had
a
challenging
twang
syson
looked
at
the
fellow
with
an
impersonal
observant
gaze
it
was
a
young
man
of
four
or
five
and
twenty
ruddy
and
well
favoured
his
dark
blue
eyes
now
stared
aggressively
at
the
intruder
his
black
moustache
very
thick
was
cropped
short
over
a
small
rather
soft
mouth
in
every
other
respect
the
fellow
was
manly
and
he
stood
just
above
middle
height
the
strong
forward
thrust
of
his
chest
and
the
perfect
ease
of
his
erect
body
gave
one
the
feeling
that
he
was
taut
with
animal
life
like
the
thick
jet
of
a
fountain
balanced
in
itself
he
stood
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
on
the
ground
looking
uncertainly
and
questioningly
at
syson
the
dark
restless
eyes
of
the
trespasser
examining
the
man
and
penetrating
into
him
without
heeding
his
office
troubled
the
keeper
and
made
him
flush
where
is
naylor
have
you
got
his
job
syson
asked
you
not
from
the
house
are
you
inquired
the
keeper
it
could
not
be
since
everyone
was
away
no
i
not
from
the
house
the
other
replied
it
seemed
to
amuse
him
then
might
i
ask
where
you
were
making
for
said
the
keeper
nettled
where
i
am
making
for
syson
repeated
i
am
going
to
this
is
the
i
think
so
down
this
path
past
the
well
and
out
by
the
white
but
that
not
the
public
i
suppose
not
i
used
to
come
so
often
in
naylor
time
i
had
forgotten
where
is
he
by
the
way
crippled
with
rheumatism
the
keeper
answered
reluctantly
is
he
syson
exclaimed
in
pain
and
who
might
you
be
asked
the
keeper
with
a
new
intonation
john
adderley
syson
i
used
to
live
in
cordy
used
to
court
hilda
millership
syson
eyes
opened
with
a
pained
smile
he
nodded
there
was
an
awkward
silence
and
are
you
asked
syson
arthur
my
uncle
said
the
other
you
live
here
in
nuttall
i
lodgin
at
my
i
see
did
you
say
you
was
goin
down
to
asked
the
keeper
there
was
a
pause
of
some
moments
before
the
keeper
blurted
courtin
hilda
the
young
fellow
looked
at
the
intruder
with
a
stubborn
defiance
almost
pathetic
syson
opened
new
eyes
are
you
he
said
astonished
the
keeper
flushed
dark
she
and
me
are
keeping
company
he
said
i
did
know
said
syson
the
other
man
waited
uncomfortably
what
is
the
thing
settled
asked
the
intruder
how
settled
retorted
the
other
sulkily
are
you
going
to
get
married
soon
and
all
that
the
keeper
stared
in
silence
for
some
moments
impotent
i
suppose
so
he
said
full
of
resentment
ah
syson
watched
closely
i
married
myself
he
added
after
a
time
you
are
said
the
other
incredulously
syson
laughed
in
his
brilliant
unhappy
way
this
last
fifteen
months
he
said
the
keeper
gazed
at
him
with
wide
wondering
eyes
apparently
thinking
back
and
trying
to
make
things
out
why
did
you
know
asked
syson
no
i
did
said
the
other
sulkily
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
ah
well
said
syson
i
will
go
on
i
suppose
i
the
keeper
stood
in
silent
opposition
the
two
men
hesitated
in
the
open
grassy
space
set
around
with
small
sheaves
of
sturdy
bluebells
a
little
open
platform
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
syson
took
a
few
indecisive
steps
forward
then
stopped
i
say
how
beautiful
he
cried
he
had
come
in
full
view
of
the
downslope
the
wide
path
ran
from
his
feet
like
a
river
and
it
was
full
of
bluebells
save
for
a
green
winding
thread
down
the
centre
where
the
keeper
walked
like
a
stream
the
path
opened
into
azure
shallows
at
the
levels
and
there
were
pools
of
bluebells
with
still
the
green
thread
winding
through
like
a
thin
current
of
through
blue
lakes
and
from
under
the
of
the
bushes
swam
the
shadowed
blue
as
if
the
flowers
lay
in
flood
water
over
the
woodland
ah
is
it
lovely
syson
exclaimed
this
was
his
past
the
country
he
had
abandoned
and
it
hurt
him
to
see
it
so
beautiful
cooed
overhead
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
brightness
of
birds
singing
if
you
married
what
do
you
keep
writing
to
her
for
and
sending
her
poetry
books
and
things
asked
the
keeper
syson
stared
at
him
taken
aback
and
humiliated
then
he
began
to
smile
well
he
said
i
did
not
know
about
you
again
the
keeper
flushed
darkly
but
if
you
are
he
charged
i
am
answered
the
other
cynically
then
looking
down
the
blue
beautiful
path
syson
felt
his
own
humiliation
what
right
have
i
to
hang
on
to
her
he
thought
bitterly
she
knows
i
married
and
all
that
he
said
but
you
keep
sending
her
books
challenged
the
keeper
syson
silenced
looked
at
the
other
man
quizzically
half
pitying
then
he
turned
good
day
he
said
and
was
gone
now
everything
irritated
him
the
two
sallows
one
all
gold
and
perfume
and
murmur
one
and
bristly
reminded
him
that
here
he
had
taught
her
about
pollination
what
a
fool
he
was
what
folly
it
all
was
ah
well
he
said
to
himself
the
poor
devil
seems
to
have
a
grudge
against
me
i
do
my
best
for
he
grinned
to
himself
in
a
very
bad
temper
ii
the
farm
was
less
than
a
hundred
yards
from
the
wood
edge
the
wall
of
trees
formed
the
fourth
side
to
the
open
quadrangle
the
house
faced
the
wood
with
tangled
emotions
syson
noted
the
plum
blossom
falling
on
the
profuse
coloured
primroses
which
he
himself
had
brought
here
and
set
how
they
had
increased
there
were
thick
tufts
of
scarlet
and
pink
and
pale
purple
primroses
under
the
plum
trees
he
saw
somebody
glance
at
him
through
the
kitchen
window
heard
men
voices
the
door
opened
suddenly
very
womanly
she
had
grown
he
felt
himself
going
pale
you
she
exclaimed
and
stood
motionless
who
called
the
farmer
voice
men
low
voices
answered
those
low
voices
curious
and
almost
jeering
roused
the
tormented
spirit
in
the
visitor
smiling
brilliantly
at
her
he
waited
not
he
said
the
flush
burned
very
deep
on
her
cheek
and
throat
we
are
just
finishing
dinner
she
said
then
i
will
stay
he
made
a
motion
to
show
that
he
would
sit
on
the
red
earthenware
pipkin
that
stood
near
the
door
among
the
daffodils
and
contained
the
drinking
water
oh
no
come
in
she
said
hurriedly
he
followed
her
in
the
doorway
he
glanced
swiftly
over
the
family
and
bowed
everyone
was
confused
the
farmer
his
wife
and
the
four
sons
sat
at
the
coarsely
laid
the
men
with
arms
bare
to
the
elbows
i
am
sorry
i
come
at
said
syson
hello
addy
said
the
farmer
assuming
the
old
form
of
address
but
his
tone
cold
how
are
you
and
he
shook
hands
shall
you
have
a
bit
he
invited
the
young
visitor
but
taking
for
granted
the
offer
would
be
refused
he
assumed
that
syson
was
become
too
refined
to
eat
so
roughly
the
young
man
winced
at
the
imputation
have
you
had
any
dinner
asked
the
daughter
no
replied
syson
it
is
too
early
i
shall
be
back
at
you
call
it
lunch
do
you
asked
the
eldest
son
almost
ironical
he
had
once
been
an
intimate
friend
of
this
young
man
we
give
addy
something
when
we
finished
said
the
mother
an
invalid
deprecating
trouble
i
do
want
to
give
you
any
trouble
said
syson
you
could
allus
live
on
fresh
air
an
scenery
laughed
the
youngest
son
a
lad
of
nineteen
syson
went
round
the
buildings
and
into
the
orchard
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
daffodils
all
along
the
hedgerow
swung
like
yellow
ruffled
birds
on
their
perches
he
loved
the
place
extraordinarily
the
hills
ranging
round
with
woods
covering
their
giant
shoulders
and
small
red
farms
like
brooches
clasping
their
garments
the
blue
streak
of
water
in
the
valley
the
bareness
of
the
home
pasture
the
sound
of
which
went
mostly
unheard
to
his
last
day
he
would
dream
of
this
place
when
he
felt
the
sun
on
his
face
or
saw
the
small
handfuls
of
snow
between
the
winter
twigs
or
smelt
the
coming
of
spring
hilda
was
very
womanly
in
her
presence
he
felt
constrained
she
was
as
he
was
but
she
seemed
to
him
much
older
he
felt
foolish
almost
unreal
beside
her
she
was
so
static
as
he
was
fingering
some
shed
plum
blossom
on
a
low
bough
she
came
to
the
back
door
to
shake
the
tablecloth
fowls
raced
from
the
stackyard
birds
rustled
from
the
trees
her
dark
hair
was
gathered
up
in
a
coil
like
a
crown
on
her
head
she
was
very
straight
distant
in
her
bearing
as
she
folded
the
cloth
she
looked
away
over
the
hills
presently
syson
returned
indoors
she
had
prepared
eggs
and
curd
cheese
stewed
gooseberries
and
cream
since
you
will
dine
tonight
she
said
i
have
only
given
you
a
light
it
is
awfully
nice
he
said
you
keep
a
real
idyllic
belt
of
straw
and
ivy
still
they
hurt
each
other
he
was
uneasy
before
her
her
brief
sure
speech
her
distant
bearing
were
unfamiliar
to
him
he
admired
again
her
eyebrows
and
her
lashes
their
eyes
met
he
saw
in
the
beautiful
grey
and
black
of
her
glance
tears
and
a
strange
light
and
at
the
back
of
all
calm
acceptance
of
herself
and
triumph
over
him
he
felt
himself
shrinking
with
an
effort
he
kept
up
the
ironic
manner
she
sent
him
into
the
parlour
while
she
washed
the
dishes
the
long
low
room
was
refurnished
from
the
abbey
sale
with
chairs
upholstered
in
rep
many
years
old
and
an
oval
table
of
polished
walnut
and
another
piano
handsome
though
still
antique
in
spite
of
the
strangeness
he
was
pleased
opening
a
high
cupboard
let
into
the
thickness
of
the
wall
he
found
it
full
of
his
books
his
old
and
volumes
of
verse
he
had
sent
her
english
and
german
the
daffodils
in
the
white
shone
across
the
room
he
could
almost
feel
their
rays
the
old
glamour
caught
him
again
his
youthful
on
the
wall
no
longer
made
him
grin
he
remembered
how
fervently
he
had
tried
to
paint
for
her
twelve
years
before
she
entered
wiping
a
dish
and
he
saw
again
the
bright
beauty
of
her
arms
you
are
quite
splendid
here
he
said
and
their
eyes
met
do
you
like
it
she
asked
it
was
the
old
low
husky
tone
of
intimacy
he
felt
a
quick
change
beginning
in
his
blood
it
was
the
old
delicious
sublimation
the
thinning
almost
the
vaporizing
of
himself
as
if
his
spirit
were
to
be
liberated
aye
he
nodded
smiling
at
her
like
a
boy
again
she
bowed
her
head
this
was
the
countess
chair
she
said
in
low
tones
i
found
her
scissors
down
here
between
the
did
you
where
are
they
quickly
with
a
lilt
in
her
movement
she
fetched
her
and
together
they
examined
the
old
scissors
what
a
ballad
of
dead
ladies
he
said
laughing
as
he
fitted
his
fingers
into
the
round
loops
of
the
countess
scissors
i
knew
you
could
use
them
she
said
with
certainty
he
looked
at
his
fingers
and
at
the
scissors
she
meant
his
fingers
were
fine
enough
for
the
scissors
that
is
something
to
be
said
for
me
he
laughed
putting
the
scissors
aside
she
turned
to
the
window
he
noticed
the
fine
fair
down
on
her
cheek
and
her
upper
lip
and
her
soft
white
neck
like
the
throat
of
a
nettle
flower
and
her
bright
as
newly
blanched
kernels
he
was
looking
at
her
with
new
eyes
and
she
was
a
different
person
to
him
he
did
not
know
her
but
he
could
regard
her
objectively
now
shall
we
go
out
awhile
she
asked
yes
he
answered
but
the
predominant
emotion
that
troubled
the
excitement
and
perplexity
of
his
heart
was
fear
fear
of
that
which
he
saw
there
was
about
her
the
same
manner
the
same
intonation
in
her
voice
now
as
then
but
she
was
not
what
he
had
known
her
to
be
he
knew
quite
well
what
she
had
been
for
him
and
gradually
he
was
realizing
that
she
was
something
quite
other
and
always
had
been
she
put
no
covering
on
her
head
merely
took
off
her
apron
saying
we
will
go
by
the
as
they
passed
the
old
orchard
she
called
him
in
to
show
him
a
nest
in
one
of
the
apple
trees
and
a
sycock
in
the
hedge
he
rather
wondered
at
her
surety
at
a
certain
hardness
like
arrogance
hidden
under
her
humility
look
at
the
apple
buds
she
said
and
he
then
perceived
myriads
of
little
scarlet
balls
among
the
drooping
boughs
watching
his
face
her
eyes
went
hard
she
saw
the
scales
were
fallen
from
him
and
at
last
he
was
going
to
see
her
as
she
was
it
was
the
thing
she
had
most
dreaded
in
the
past
and
most
needed
for
her
soul
sake
now
he
was
going
to
see
her
as
she
was
he
would
not
love
her
and
he
would
know
he
never
could
have
loved
her
the
old
illusion
gone
they
were
strangers
crude
and
entire
but
he
would
give
her
her
would
have
her
due
from
him
she
was
brilliant
as
he
had
not
known
her
she
showed
him
nests
a
jenny
wren
in
a
low
bush
see
this
jinty
she
exclaimed
he
was
surprised
to
hear
her
use
the
local
name
she
reached
carefully
through
the
thorns
and
put
her
fingers
in
the
nest
round
door
five
she
said
tiny
little
she
showed
him
nests
of
robins
and
chaffinches
and
linnets
and
buntings
of
a
wagtail
beside
the
water
and
if
we
go
down
nearer
the
lake
i
will
show
you
a
kingfisher
among
the
young
fir
trees
she
said
there
a
throstle
or
a
blackie
on
nearly
every
bough
every
ledge
the
first
day
when
i
had
seen
them
all
i
felt
as
if
i
must
go
in
the
wood
it
seemed
a
city
of
birds
and
in
the
morning
hearing
them
all
i
thought
of
the
noisy
early
markets
i
was
afraid
to
go
in
my
own
she
was
using
the
language
they
had
both
of
them
invented
now
it
was
all
her
own
he
had
done
with
it
she
did
not
mind
his
silence
but
was
always
dominant
letting
him
see
her
wood
as
they
came
along
a
marshy
path
where
were
opening
in
a
rich
blue
drift
we
know
all
the
birds
but
there
are
many
flowers
we
ca
find
out
she
said
it
was
half
an
appeal
to
him
who
had
known
the
names
of
things
she
looked
dreamily
across
to
the
open
fields
that
slept
in
the
sun
i
have
a
lover
as
well
you
know
she
said
with
assurance
yet
dropping
again
almost
into
the
intimate
tone
this
woke
in
him
the
spirit
to
fight
her
i
think
i
met
him
he
is
in
without
answering
she
turned
into
a
dark
path
that
led
where
the
trees
and
undergrowth
were
very
thick
they
did
well
she
said
at
length
to
have
various
altars
to
various
gods
in
old
ah
yes
he
agreed
to
whom
is
the
new
one
there
are
no
old
ones
she
said
i
was
always
looking
for
and
whose
is
it
he
asked
i
do
know
she
said
looking
full
at
him
i
very
glad
for
your
sake
he
said
that
you
are
the
man
does
matter
so
much
she
said
there
was
a
pause
no
he
exclaimed
astonished
yet
recognizing
her
as
her
real
self
it
is
one
self
that
matters
she
said
whether
one
is
being
own
self
and
serving
one
own
there
was
silence
during
which
he
pondered
the
path
was
almost
flowerless
gloomy
at
the
side
his
heels
sank
into
soft
clay
iii
i
she
said
very
slowly
i
was
married
the
same
night
as
he
looked
at
her
not
legally
of
course
she
replied
to
the
keeper
he
said
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
she
turned
to
him
you
thought
i
could
not
she
said
but
the
flush
was
deep
in
her
cheek
and
throat
for
all
her
assurance
still
he
would
not
say
anything
you
see
was
making
an
effort
to
i
had
to
understand
and
what
does
it
amount
to
this
understanding
he
asked
a
very
great
it
not
to
you
she
replied
one
is
and
you
are
not
disappointed
far
from
it
her
tone
was
deep
and
sincere
you
love
him
yes
i
love
good
he
said
this
silenced
her
for
a
while
here
among
his
things
i
love
him
she
said
his
conceit
would
not
let
him
be
silent
it
needs
this
setting
he
asked
it
does
she
cried
you
were
always
making
me
to
be
not
he
laughed
shortly
but
is
it
a
matter
of
surroundings
he
said
he
had
considered
her
all
spirit
i
am
like
a
plant
she
replied
i
can
only
grow
in
my
own
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
undergrowth
shrank
away
leaving
a
bare
brown
space
pillared
with
the
and
purplish
trunks
of
pine
trees
on
the
fringe
hung
the
sombre
green
of
elder
trees
with
flat
flowers
in
bud
and
below
were
bright
unfurling
pennons
of
fern
in
the
midst
of
the
bare
space
stood
a
keeper
log
hut
were
lying
about
some
occupied
by
a
clucking
hen
some
empty
hilda
walked
over
the
brown
to
the
hut
took
a
key
from
among
the
eaves
and
opened
the
door
it
was
a
bare
wooden
place
with
a
carpenter
bench
and
form
carpenter
tools
an
axe
snares
straps
some
skins
pegged
down
everything
in
order
hilda
closed
the
door
syson
examined
the
weird
flat
coats
of
wild
animals
that
were
pegged
down
to
be
cured
she
turned
some
knotch
in
the
side
wall
and
disclosed
a
second
small
apartment
how
romantic
said
syson
yes
he
is
very
has
some
of
a
wild
animal
a
nice
he
is
inventive
and
not
beyond
a
certain
she
pulled
back
a
dark
green
curtain
the
apartment
was
occupied
almost
entirely
by
a
large
couch
of
heather
and
bracken
on
which
was
spread
an
ample
rug
on
the
floor
were
patchwork
rugs
of
and
a
red
while
hanging
from
the
wall
were
other
furs
hilda
took
down
one
which
she
put
on
it
was
a
cloak
of
and
of
white
fur
with
a
hood
apparently
of
the
skins
of
stoats
she
laughed
at
syson
from
out
of
this
barbaric
mantle
saying
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
congratulate
you
on
your
man
he
replied
and
look
she
said
in
a
little
jar
on
a
shelf
were
some
sprays
frail
and
white
of
the
first
honeysuckle
they
will
scent
the
place
at
night
she
said
he
looked
round
curiously
where
does
he
come
short
then
he
asked
she
gazed
at
him
for
a
few
moments
then
turning
aside
the
stars
are
the
same
with
him
she
said
you
could
make
them
flash
and
quiver
and
the
come
up
at
me
like
phosphorescence
you
could
make
things
wonderful
i
have
found
it
is
true
but
i
have
them
all
for
myself
he
laughed
saying
after
all
stars
and
are
only
luxuries
you
ought
to
make
aye
she
assented
but
i
have
them
all
again
he
laughed
bitterly
at
her
she
turned
swiftly
he
was
leaning
against
the
small
window
of
the
tiny
obscure
room
and
was
watching
her
who
stood
in
the
doorway
still
cloaked
in
her
mantle
his
cap
was
removed
so
she
saw
his
face
and
head
distinctly
in
the
dim
room
his
black
straight
glossy
hair
was
brushed
clean
back
from
his
brow
his
black
eyes
were
watching
her
and
his
face
that
was
clear
and
cream
and
perfectly
smooth
was
flickering
we
are
very
different
she
said
bitterly
again
he
laughed
i
see
you
disapprove
of
me
he
said
i
disapprove
of
what
you
have
become
she
said
you
think
we
might
glanced
at
the
have
been
like
and
i
she
shook
her
head
you
no
never
you
plucked
a
thing
and
looked
at
it
till
you
had
found
out
all
you
wanted
to
know
about
it
then
you
threw
it
away
she
said
did
i
he
asked
and
could
your
way
never
have
been
my
way
i
suppose
why
should
it
she
said
i
am
a
separate
but
surely
two
people
sometimes
go
the
same
way
he
said
you
took
me
away
from
myself
she
said
he
knew
he
had
mistaken
her
had
taken
her
for
something
she
was
not
that
was
his
fault
not
hers
and
did
you
always
know
he
asked
never
let
me
know
you
bullied
me
i
could
help
myself
i
was
glad
when
you
left
me
i
know
you
were
he
said
but
his
face
went
paler
almost
deathly
luminous
yet
he
said
it
was
you
who
sent
me
the
way
i
have
i
she
exclaimed
in
pride
you
would
have
me
take
the
grammar
school
you
would
have
me
foster
poor
little
botell
fervent
attachment
to
me
till
he
could
live
without
because
botell
was
rich
and
influential
you
triumphed
in
the
offer
to
send
me
to
cambridge
to
befriend
his
only
child
you
wanted
me
to
rise
in
the
world
and
all
the
time
you
were
sending
me
away
from
new
success
of
mine
put
a
separation
between
us
and
more
for
you
than
for
me
you
never
wanted
to
come
with
me
you
wanted
just
to
send
me
to
see
what
it
was
like
i
believe
you
even
wanted
me
to
marry
a
lady
you
wanted
to
triumph
over
society
in
and
i
am
responsible
she
said
with
sarcasm
i
distinguished
myself
to
satisfy
you
he
replied
ah
she
cried
you
always
wanted
change
change
like
a
very
well
and
i
am
a
success
and
i
know
it
and
i
do
some
good
work
thought
you
were
different
what
right
have
you
to
a
man
what
do
you
want
she
said
looking
at
him
with
wide
fearful
eyes
he
looked
back
at
her
his
eyes
pointed
like
weapons
why
nothing
he
laughed
shortly
there
was
a
rattling
at
the
outer
latch
and
the
keeper
entered
the
woman
glanced
round
but
remained
standing
in
the
inner
doorway
syson
did
not
move
the
other
man
entered
saw
and
turned
away
without
speaking
the
two
also
were
silent
pilbeam
attended
to
his
skins
i
must
go
said
syson
yes
she
replied
then
i
give
you
our
vast
and
varying
fortunes
he
lifted
his
hand
in
pledge
our
vast
and
varying
fortunes
she
answered
gravely
and
speaking
in
cold
tones
arthur
she
said
the
keeper
pretended
not
to
hear
syson
watching
keenly
began
to
smile
the
woman
drew
herself
up
arthur
she
said
again
with
a
curious
upward
inflection
which
warned
the
two
men
that
her
soul
was
trembling
on
a
dangerous
crisis
the
keeper
slowly
put
down
his
tool
and
came
to
her
yes
he
said
i
wanted
to
introduce
you
she
said
trembling
i
met
him
said
the
keeper
have
you
it
is
addy
mr
syson
whom
you
know
is
arthur
mr
pilbeam
she
added
turning
to
syson
the
latter
held
out
his
hand
to
the
keeper
and
they
shook
hands
in
silence
i
glad
to
have
met
you
said
syson
we
drop
our
correspondence
hilda
why
need
we
she
asked
the
two
men
stood
at
a
loss
is
there
no
need
said
syson
still
she
was
silent
it
is
as
you
will
she
said
they
went
all
three
together
down
the
gloomy
path
était
bleu
le
ciel
et
grand
quoted
syson
not
knowing
what
to
say
what
do
you
mean
she
said
besides
we
ca
walk
in
our
wild
never
sowed
syson
looked
at
her
he
was
startled
to
see
his
young
love
his
nun
his
botticelli
angel
so
revealed
it
was
he
who
had
been
the
fool
he
and
she
were
more
separate
than
any
two
strangers
could
be
she
only
wanted
to
keep
up
a
correspondence
with
he
of
course
wanted
it
kept
up
so
that
he
could
write
to
her
like
dante
to
some
beatrice
who
had
never
existed
save
in
the
man
own
brain
at
the
bottom
of
the
path
she
left
him
he
went
along
with
the
keeper
towards
the
open
towards
the
gate
that
closed
on
the
wood
the
two
men
walked
almost
like
friends
they
did
not
broach
the
subject
of
their
thoughts
instead
of
going
straight
to
the
gate
syson
went
along
the
wood
edge
where
the
brook
spread
out
in
a
little
bog
and
under
the
alder
trees
among
the
reeds
great
yellow
stools
and
bosses
of
marigolds
shone
threads
of
brown
water
trickled
by
touched
with
gold
from
the
flowers
suddenly
there
was
a
blue
flash
in
the
air
as
a
kingfisher
passed
syson
was
extraordinarily
moved
he
climbed
the
bank
to
the
gorse
bushes
whose
sparks
of
blossom
had
not
yet
gathered
into
a
flame
lying
on
the
dry
brown
turf
he
discovered
sprigs
of
tiny
purple
milkwort
and
pink
spots
of
lousewort
what
a
wonderful
world
it
for
ever
new
he
felt
as
if
it
were
underground
like
the
fields
of
monotone
hell
notwithstanding
inside
his
breast
was
a
pain
like
a
wound
he
remembered
the
poem
of
william
morris
where
in
the
chapel
of
lyonesse
a
knight
lay
wounded
with
the
truncheon
of
a
spear
deep
in
his
breast
lying
always
as
dead
yet
did
not
die
while
day
after
day
the
coloured
sunlight
dipped
from
the
painted
window
across
the
chancel
and
passed
away
he
knew
now
it
never
had
been
true
that
which
was
between
him
and
her
not
for
a
moment
the
truth
had
stood
apart
all
the
time
syson
turned
over
the
air
was
full
of
the
sound
of
larks
as
if
the
sunshine
above
were
condensing
and
falling
in
a
shower
amid
this
bright
sound
voices
sounded
small
and
distinct
but
if
he
married
an
quite
willing
to
drop
it
off
what
has
ter
against
it
said
the
man
voice
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
now
i
want
to
be
syson
looked
through
the
bushes
hilda
was
standing
in
the
wood
near
the
gate
the
man
was
in
the
field
loitering
by
the
hedge
and
playing
with
the
bees
as
they
settled
on
the
white
bramble
flowers
there
was
silence
for
a
while
in
which
syson
imagined
her
will
among
the
brightness
of
the
larks
suddenly
the
keeper
exclaimed
ah
and
swore
he
was
gripping
at
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
near
the
shoulder
then
he
pulled
off
his
jacket
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
absorbedly
rolled
up
his
shirt
sleeve
right
to
the
shoulder
ah
he
said
vindictively
as
he
picked
out
the
bee
and
flung
it
away
he
twisted
his
fine
bright
arm
peering
awkwardly
over
his
shoulder
what
is
it
asked
hilda
a
up
my
sleeve
he
answered
come
here
to
me
she
said
the
keeper
went
to
her
like
a
sulky
boy
she
took
his
arm
in
her
hands
here
it
the
sting
left
bee
she
picked
out
the
sting
put
her
mouth
to
his
arm
and
sucked
away
the
drop
of
poison
as
she
looked
at
the
red
mark
her
mouth
had
made
and
at
his
arm
she
said
laughing
that
is
the
reddest
kiss
you
will
ever
when
syson
next
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
voices
he
saw
in
the
shadow
the
keeper
with
his
mouth
on
the
throat
of
his
beloved
whose
head
was
thrown
back
and
whose
hair
had
fallen
so
that
one
rough
rope
of
dark
brown
hair
hung
across
his
bare
arm
no
the
woman
answered
i
am
not
upset
because
he
gone
you
understand
syson
could
not
distinguish
what
the
man
said
hilda
replied
clear
and
distinct
you
know
i
love
you
he
has
gone
quite
out
of
my
trouble
about
him
he
kissed
her
murmuring
she
laughed
hollowly
yes
she
said
indulgent
we
will
be
married
we
will
be
married
but
not
just
he
spoke
to
her
again
syson
heard
nothing
for
a
time
then
she
said
you
must
go
home
now
will
get
no
again
was
heard
the
murmur
of
the
keeper
voice
troubled
by
fear
and
passion
but
why
should
we
be
married
at
once
she
said
what
more
would
you
have
by
being
married
it
is
most
beautiful
as
it
at
last
he
pulled
on
his
coat
and
departed
she
stood
at
the
gate
not
watching
him
but
looking
over
the
sunny
country
when
at
last
she
had
gone
syson
also
departed
going
back
to
town
second
best
oh
i
tired
frances
exclaimed
petulantly
and
in
the
same
instant
she
dropped
down
on
the
turf
near
the
anne
stood
a
moment
surprised
then
accustomed
to
the
vagaries
of
her
beloved
frances
said
well
and
are
you
always
likely
to
be
tired
after
travelling
that
blessed
long
way
from
liverpool
yesterday
and
she
plumped
down
beside
her
sister
anne
was
a
wise
young
body
of
fourteen
very
buxom
brimming
with
common
sense
frances
was
much
older
about
and
whimsical
spasmodic
she
was
the
beauty
and
the
clever
child
of
the
family
she
plucked
the
buttons
from
her
dress
in
a
nervous
desperate
fashion
her
beautiful
profile
looped
above
with
black
hair
warm
with
the
complexion
of
a
pear
was
calm
as
a
mask
her
thin
brown
hand
plucked
nervously
it
not
the
journey
she
said
objecting
to
anne
obtuseness
anne
looked
inquiringly
at
her
darling
the
young
girl
in
her
practical
way
proceeded
to
reckon
up
this
whimsical
creature
but
suddenly
she
found
herself
full
in
the
eyes
of
frances
felt
two
dark
hectic
eyes
flaring
challenge
at
her
and
she
shrank
away
frances
was
peculiar
for
these
great
exposed
looks
which
disconcerted
people
by
their
violence
and
their
suddenness
what
a
matter
poor
old
duck
asked
anne
as
she
folded
the
slight
wilful
form
of
her
sister
in
her
arms
frances
laughed
shakily
and
nestled
down
for
comfort
on
the
budding
breasts
of
the
strong
girl
oh
i
only
a
bit
tired
she
murmured
on
the
point
of
tears
well
of
course
you
are
what
do
you
expect
soothed
anne
it
was
a
joke
to
frances
that
anne
should
play
elder
almost
mother
to
her
but
then
anne
was
in
her
unvexed
teens
men
were
like
big
dogs
to
her
while
frances
at
suffered
a
good
deal
the
country
was
intensely
on
the
common
everything
shone
beside
its
shadow
and
the
hillside
gave
off
heat
in
silence
the
brown
turf
seemed
in
a
low
state
of
combustion
the
leaves
of
the
oaks
were
scorched
brown
among
the
blackish
foliage
in
the
distance
shone
the
small
red
and
orange
of
the
village
the
willows
in
the
at
the
foot
of
the
common
suddenly
shook
with
a
dazzling
effect
like
diamonds
it
was
a
puff
of
wind
anne
resumed
her
normal
position
she
spread
her
knees
and
put
in
her
lap
a
handful
of
hazel
nuts
leafy
things
whose
one
cheek
was
tanned
between
brown
and
pink
these
she
began
to
crack
and
eat
frances
with
bowed
head
mused
bitterly
eh
you
know
tom
smedley
began
the
young
girl
as
she
pulled
a
tight
kernel
out
of
its
shell
i
suppose
so
replied
frances
sarcastically
well
he
gave
me
a
wild
rabbit
what
he
caught
to
keep
with
my
tame
it
that
a
good
thing
said
frances
very
detached
and
ironic
well
it
is
he
reckoned
he
take
me
to
ollerton
feast
but
he
never
did
look
here
he
took
a
servant
from
the
rectory
i
saw
so
he
ought
said
frances
no
he
ought
and
i
told
him
so
and
i
told
him
i
should
tell
i
have
click
and
snap
went
a
nut
between
her
teeth
she
sorted
out
the
kernel
and
chewed
complacently
it
does
make
much
difference
said
frances
well
it
does
but
i
was
mad
with
him
all
the
why
because
i
was
he
no
right
to
go
with
a
he
a
perfect
right
persisted
frances
very
just
and
cold
no
he
has
when
he
said
he
take
frances
burst
into
a
laugh
of
amusement
and
relief
oh
no
i
forgot
that
she
said
adding
and
what
did
he
say
when
you
promised
to
tell
me
he
laughed
and
said
wo
fret
her
fat
over
that
and
she
wo
sniffed
frances
there
was
silence
the
common
with
its
sere
thistles
its
heaps
of
silent
bramble
its
gorse
in
the
glare
of
sunshine
seemed
visionary
across
the
brook
began
the
immense
pattern
of
agriculture
white
chequering
of
barley
stubble
brown
squares
of
wheat
khaki
patches
of
pasture
red
stripes
of
fallow
with
the
woodland
and
the
tiny
village
dark
like
ornaments
leading
away
to
the
distance
right
to
the
hills
where
the
grew
smaller
and
smaller
till
in
the
blackish
haze
of
heat
far
off
only
the
tiny
white
squares
of
barley
stubble
showed
distinct
eh
i
say
here
a
rabbit
hole
cried
anne
suddenly
should
we
watch
if
one
comes
out
you
wo
have
to
fidget
you
the
two
girls
sat
perfectly
still
frances
watched
certain
objects
in
her
surroundings
they
had
a
peculiar
unfriendly
look
about
them
the
weight
of
greenish
elderberries
on
their
purpling
stalks
the
twinkling
of
the
yellowing
that
clustered
high
up
in
the
hedge
against
the
sky
the
exhausted
limp
leaves
of
the
primroses
lying
flat
in
the
all
looked
strange
to
her
then
her
eyes
caught
a
movement
a
mole
was
moving
silently
over
the
warm
red
soil
nosing
shuffling
hither
and
thither
flat
and
dark
as
a
shadow
shifting
about
and
as
suddenly
brisk
and
as
silent
like
a
very
ghost
of
joie
de
vivre
frances
started
from
habit
was
about
to
call
on
anne
to
kill
the
little
pest
but
today
her
lethargy
of
unhappiness
was
too
much
for
her
she
watched
the
little
brute
paddling
snuffing
touching
things
to
discover
them
running
in
blindness
delighted
to
ecstasy
by
the
sunlight
and
the
hot
strange
things
that
caressed
its
belly
and
its
nose
she
felt
a
keen
pity
for
the
little
creature
eh
our
fran
look
there
it
a
anne
was
on
her
feet
standing
watching
the
dark
unconscious
beast
frances
frowned
with
anxiety
it
does
run
off
does
it
said
the
young
girl
softly
then
she
stealthily
approached
the
creature
the
mole
paddled
fumblingly
away
in
an
instant
anne
put
her
foot
upon
it
not
too
heavily
frances
could
see
the
struggling
swimming
movement
of
the
little
pink
hands
of
the
brute
the
twisting
and
twitching
of
its
pointed
nose
as
it
wrestled
under
the
sole
of
the
boot
it
does
wriggle
said
the
bonny
girl
knitting
her
brows
in
a
frown
at
the
eerie
sensation
then
she
bent
down
to
look
at
her
trap
frances
could
now
see
beyond
the
edge
of
the
the
heaving
of
the
velvet
shoulders
the
pitiful
turning
of
the
sightless
face
the
frantic
rowing
of
the
flat
pink
hands
kill
the
thing
she
said
turning
away
her
face
not
laughed
anne
shrinking
you
can
if
you
i
do
like
said
frances
with
quiet
intensity
after
several
dabbling
attempts
anne
succeeded
in
picking
up
the
little
animal
by
the
scruff
of
its
neck
it
threw
back
its
head
flung
its
long
blind
snout
from
side
to
side
the
mouth
open
in
a
peculiar
oblong
with
tiny
pinkish
teeth
at
the
edge
the
blind
frantic
mouth
gaped
and
writhed
the
body
heavy
and
clumsy
hung
scarcely
moving
is
it
a
snappy
little
thing
observed
anne
twisting
to
avoid
the
teeth
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
frances
sharply
it
got
to
be
at
the
damage
they
do
i
s
take
it
home
and
let
dadda
or
somebody
kill
it
i
not
going
to
let
it
she
swaddled
the
creature
clumsily
in
her
and
sat
down
beside
her
sister
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
during
which
anne
combated
the
efforts
of
the
mole
you
not
had
much
to
say
about
jimmy
this
time
did
you
see
him
often
in
liverpool
anne
asked
suddenly
once
or
twice
replied
frances
giving
no
sign
of
how
the
question
troubled
her
and
are
you
sweet
on
him
any
more
then
i
should
think
i
not
seeing
that
he
engaged
jimmy
barrass
well
of
all
things
i
never
thought
he
get
why
not
he
as
much
right
as
anybody
else
snapped
frances
anne
was
fumbling
with
the
mole
so
she
said
at
length
but
i
never
thought
jimmy
would
why
not
snapped
frances
i
do
blessed
mole
it
not
keep
still
he
got
engaged
to
how

enough

a
doctor
of
frances
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
she
asked
i
sure
it
got
a
lot
he
want
to
feel

got

it
go
in
but
at
this
juncture
the
mole
almost
succeeded
in
wriggling
clear
it
wrestled
and
twisted
frantically
waved
its
pointed
blind
head
its
mouth
standing
open
like
a
little
shaft
its
big
wrinkled
hands
spread
out
go
in
with
you
urged
anne
poking
the
little
creature
with
her
forefinger
trying
to
get
it
back
into
the
handkerchief
suddenly
the
mouth
turned
like
a
spark
on
her
finger
oh
she
cried
he
bit
she
dropped
him
to
the
floor
dazed
the
blind
creature
fumbled
round
frances
felt
like
shrieking
she
expected
him
to
dart
away
in
a
flash
like
a
mouse
and
there
he
remained
groping
she
wanted
to
cry
to
him
to
be
gone
anne
in
a
sudden
decision
of
wrath
caught
up
her
with
one
blow
the
mole
was
dead
frances
was
startled
and
shocked
one
moment
the
little
wretch
was
fussing
in
the
heat
and
the
next
it
lay
like
a
little
bag
inert
and
a
struggle
scarce
a
quiver
it
is
dead
frances
said
breathlessly
anne
took
her
finger
from
her
mouth
looked
at
the
tiny
pinpricks
and
said
yes
he
is
and
i
glad
they
vicious
little
nuisances
moles
with
which
her
wrath
vanished
she
picked
up
the
dead
animal
has
it
got
a
beautiful
skin
she
mused
stroking
the
fur
with
her
forefinger
then
with
her
cheek
mind
said
frances
sharply
you
have
the
blood
on
your
skirt
one
ruby
drop
of
blood
hung
on
the
small
snout
ready
to
fall
anne
shook
it
off
on
to
some
harebells
frances
suddenly
became
calm
in
that
moment
i
suppose
they
have
to
be
killed
she
said
and
a
certain
rather
dreary
indifference
succeeded
to
her
grief
the
twinkling
the
glitter
of
brilliant
willows
now
seemed
to
her
trifling
scarcely
worth
the
notice
something
had
died
in
her
so
that
things
lost
their
poignancy
she
was
calm
indifference
overlying
her
quiet
sadness
rising
she
walked
down
to
the
brook
course
here
wait
for
me
cried
anne
coming
tumbling
after
frances
stood
on
the
bridge
looking
at
the
red
mud
trodden
into
pockets
by
the
feet
of
cattle
there
was
not
a
drain
of
water
left
but
everything
smelled
green
succulent
why
did
she
care
so
little
for
anne
who
was
so
fond
of
her
she
asked
herself
why
did
she
care
so
little
for
anyone
she
did
not
know
but
she
felt
a
rather
stubborn
pride
in
her
isolation
and
indifference
they
entered
a
field
where
stooks
of
barley
stood
in
rows
the
straight
blonde
tresses
of
the
corn
streaming
on
to
the
ground
the
stubble
was
bleached
by
the
intense
summer
so
that
the
expanse
glared
white
the
next
field
was
sweet
and
soft
with
a
second
crop
of
seeds
thin
straggling
clover
whose
little
pink
knobs
rested
prettily
in
the
dark
green
the
scent
was
faint
and
sickly
the
girls
came
up
in
single
file
frances
leading
near
the
gate
a
young
man
was
mowing
with
the
scythe
some
fodder
for
the
afternoon
feed
of
the
cattle
as
he
saw
the
girls
he
left
off
working
and
waited
in
an
aimless
kind
of
way
frances
was
dressed
in
white
muslin
and
she
walked
with
dignity
detached
and
forgetful
her
lack
of
agitation
her
simple
unheeding
advance
made
him
nervous
she
had
loved
the
jimmy
for
five
years
having
had
in
return
his
this
man
only
affected
her
slightly
tom
was
of
medium
stature
energetic
in
build
his
smooth
face
was
burned
red
not
brown
by
the
sun
and
this
ruddiness
enhanced
his
appearance
of
good
humour
and
easiness
being
a
year
older
than
frances
he
would
have
courted
her
long
ago
had
she
been
so
inclined
as
it
was
he
had
gone
his
uneventful
way
amiably
chatting
with
many
a
girl
but
remaining
unattached
free
of
trouble
for
the
most
part
only
he
knew
he
wanted
a
woman
he
hitched
his
trousers
just
a
trifle
as
the
girls
approached
frances
was
a
rare
delicate
kind
of
being
whom
he
realized
with
a
queer
and
delicious
stimulation
in
his
veins
she
gave
him
a
slight
sense
of
suffocation
somehow
this
morning
she
affected
him
more
than
usual
she
was
dressed
in
white
he
however
being
in
his
mind
did
not
realize
his
feeling
had
never
become
conscious
purposive
frances
knew
what
she
was
about
tom
was
ready
to
love
her
as
soon
as
she
would
show
him
now
that
she
could
not
have
jimmy
she
did
not
poignantly
care
still
she
would
have
something
if
she
could
not
have
the
whom
she
knew
to
be
something
of
a
would
have
the
second
best
tom
she
advanced
rather
indifferently
you
are
back
then
said
tom
she
marked
the
touch
of
uncertainty
in
his
voice
no
she
laughed
i
still
in
liverpool
and
the
undertone
of
intimacy
made
him
burn
this
is
you
then
he
asked
her
heart
leapt
up
in
approval
she
looked
in
his
eyes
and
for
a
second
was
with
him
why
what
do
you
think
she
laughed
he
lifted
his
hat
from
his
head
with
a
distracted
little
gesture
she
liked
him
his
quaint
ways
his
humour
his
ignorance
and
his
slow
masculinity
here
look
here
tom
smedley
broke
in
anne
a
moudiwarp
did
you
find
it
dead
he
asked
no
it
bit
me
said
anne
oh
aye
an
that
got
your
rag
out
did
it
no
it
did
anne
scolded
sharply
such
language
oh
what
up
wi
it
i
ca
bear
you
to
talk
ca
you
he
glanced
at
frances
it
is
nice
frances
said
she
did
not
care
really
the
vulgar
speech
jarred
on
her
as
a
rule
jimmy
was
a
gentleman
but
tom
manner
of
speech
did
not
matter
to
her
i
like
you
to
talk
nicely
she
added
do
you
he
replied
tilting
his
hat
stirred
and
generally
you
do
you
know
she
smiled
i
s
have
to
have
a
try
he
said
rather
tensely
gallant
what
she
asked
brightly
to
talk
nice
to
you
he
said
frances
coloured
furiously
bent
her
head
for
a
moment
then
laughed
gaily
as
if
she
liked
this
clumsy
hint
eh
now
you
mind
what
you
saying
cried
anne
giving
the
young
man
an
admonitory
pat
you
would
have
to
give
yon
mole
many
knocks
like
that
he
teased
relieved
to
get
on
safe
ground
rubbing
his
arm
no
indeed
it
died
in
one
blow
said
frances
with
a
flippancy
that
was
hateful
to
her
you
not
so
good
at
knockin
he
said
turning
to
her
i
do
know
if
i
cross
she
said
decisively
no
he
replied
with
alert
attentiveness
i
could
she
added
harder
if
it
was
he
was
slow
to
feel
her
difference
and
do
you
consider
it
is
necessary
he
asked
with
misgiving
it
she
said
looking
at
him
steadily
coldly
i
reckon
it
is
he
replied
looking
away
but
standing
stubborn
she
laughed
quickly
but
it
is
necessary
for
me
she
said
with
slight
contempt
yes
that
quite
true
he
answered
she
laughed
in
a
shaky
fashion
i
know
it
is
she
said
and
there
was
an
awkward
pause
why
would
you
like
me
to
kill
moles
then
she
asked
tentatively
after
a
while
they
do
us
a
lot
of
damage
he
said
standing
firm
on
his
own
ground
angered
well
i
see
the
next
time
i
come
across
one
she
promised
defiantly
their
eyes
met
and
she
sank
before
him
her
pride
troubled
he
felt
uneasy
and
triumphant
and
baffled
as
if
fate
had
gripped
him
she
smiled
as
she
departed
well
said
anne
as
the
sisters
went
through
the
wheat
stubble
i
do
know
what
you
two
been
jawing
about
i
do
you
laughed
frances
significantly
no
i
do
but
at
any
rate
tom
smedley
a
good
deal
better
to
my
thinking
than
jimmy
so
perhaps
he
is
said
frances
coldly
and
the
next
day
after
a
secret
persistent
hunt
she
found
another
mole
playing
in
the
heat
she
killed
it
and
in
the
evening
when
tom
came
to
the
gate
to
smoke
his
pipe
after
supper
she
took
him
the
dead
creature
here
you
are
then
she
said
did
you
catch
it
he
replied
taking
the
velvet
corpse
into
his
fingers
and
examining
it
minutely
this
was
to
hide
his
trepidation
did
you
think
i
could
she
asked
her
face
very
near
his
nay
i
did
she
laughed
in
his
face
a
strange
little
laugh
that
caught
her
breath
all
agitation
and
tears
and
recklessness
of
desire
he
looked
frightened
and
upset
she
put
her
hand
to
his
arm
shall
you
go
out
wi
me
he
asked
in
a
difficult
troubled
tone
she
turned
her
face
away
with
a
shaky
laugh
the
blood
came
up
in
him
strong
overmastering
he
resisted
it
but
it
drove
him
down
and
he
was
carried
away
seeing
the
winsome
frail
nape
of
her
neck
fierce
love
came
upon
him
for
her
and
tenderness
we
s
to
tell
your
mother
he
said
and
he
stood
suffering
resisting
his
passion
for
her
yes
she
replied
in
a
dead
voice
but
there
was
a
thrill
of
pleasure
in
this
death
the
shadow
in
the
rose
garden
a
rather
small
young
man
sat
by
the
window
of
a
pretty
seaside
cottage
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
reading
the
newspaper
it
was
about
eight
in
the
morning
outside
the
glory
roses
hung
in
the
morning
sunshine
like
little
bowls
of
fire
tipped
up
the
young
man
looked
at
the
table
then
at
the
clock
then
at
his
own
big
silver
watch
an
expression
of
stiff
endurance
came
on
to
his
face
then
he
rose
and
reflected
on
the
that
hung
on
the
walls
of
the
room
giving
careful
but
hostile
attention
to
the
stag
at
bay
he
tried
the
lid
of
the
piano
and
found
it
locked
he
caught
sight
of
his
own
face
in
a
little
mirror
pulled
his
brown
moustache
and
an
alert
interest
sprang
into
his
eyes
he
was
not
he
twisted
his
moustache
his
figure
was
rather
small
but
alert
and
vigorous
as
he
turned
from
the
mirror
a
look
of
mingled
with
his
appreciation
of
his
own
physiognomy
in
a
state
of
he
went
through
into
the
garden
his
jacket
however
did
not
look
dejected
it
was
new
and
had
a
smart
and
air
sitting
upon
a
confident
body
he
contemplated
the
tree
of
heaven
that
flourished
by
the
lawn
then
sauntered
on
to
the
next
plant
there
was
more
promise
in
a
crooked
apple
tree
covered
with
fruit
glancing
round
he
broke
off
an
apple
and
with
his
back
to
the
house
took
a
clean
sharp
bite
to
his
surprise
the
fruit
was
sweet
he
took
another
then
again
he
turned
to
survey
the
bedroom
windows
overlooking
the
garden
he
started
seeing
a
woman
figure
but
it
was
only
his
wife
she
was
gazing
across
to
the
sea
apparently
ignorant
of
him
for
a
moment
or
two
he
looked
at
her
watching
her
she
was
a
woman
who
seemed
older
than
he
rather
pale
but
healthy
her
face
yearning
her
rich
auburn
hair
was
heaped
in
folds
on
her
forehead
she
looked
apart
from
him
and
his
world
gazing
away
to
the
sea
it
irked
her
husband
that
she
should
continue
abstracted
and
in
ignorance
of
him
he
pulled
poppy
fruits
and
threw
them
at
the
window
she
started
glanced
at
him
with
a
wild
smile
and
looked
away
again
then
almost
immediately
she
left
the
window
he
went
indoors
to
meet
her
she
had
a
fine
carriage
very
proud
and
wore
a
dress
of
soft
white
muslin
i
been
waiting
long
enough
he
said
for
me
or
for
breakfast
she
said
lightly
you
know
we
said
nine
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
slept
after
the
you
know
i
always
up
at
five
and
i
could
stop
in
bed
after
six
you
might
as
well
be
in
pit
as
in
bed
on
a
morning
like
i
should
have
thought
the
pit
would
occur
to
you
she
moved
about
examining
the
room
looking
at
the
ornaments
under
glass
covers
he
planted
on
the
hearthrug
watched
her
rather
uneasily
and
grudgingly
indulgent
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
at
the
apartment
come
she
said
taking
his
arm
let
us
go
into
the
garden
till
mrs
coates
brings
the
i
hope
she
be
quick
he
said
pulling
his
moustache
she
gave
a
short
laugh
and
leaned
on
his
arm
as
they
went
he
had
lighted
a
pipe
mrs
coates
entered
the
room
as
they
went
down
the
steps
the
delightful
erect
old
lady
hastened
to
the
window
for
a
good
view
of
her
visitors
her
eyes
were
bright
as
she
watched
the
young
couple
go
down
the
path
he
walking
in
an
easy
confident
fashion
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
the
landlady
began
talking
to
herself
in
a
soft
yorkshire
accent
just
of
a
height
they
are
she
would
ha
married
a
man
less
than
herself
in
stature
i
think
though
he
not
her
equal
here
her
granddaughter
came
in
setting
a
tray
on
the
table
the
girl
went
to
the
old
woman
side
he
been
eating
the
apples
gran
she
said
has
he
my
pet
well
if
he
happy
why
not
outside
the
young
man
listened
with
impatience
to
the
chink
of
the
teacups
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
relief
the
couple
came
in
to
breakfast
after
he
had
eaten
for
some
time
he
rested
a
moment
and
said
do
you
think
it
any
better
place
than
bridlington
i
do
she
said
infinitely
besides
i
am
at
home
not
like
a
strange
seaside
place
to
how
long
were
you
here
two
he
ate
reflectively
i
should
ha
thought
you
rather
go
to
a
fresh
place
he
said
at
length
she
sat
very
silent
and
then
delicately
put
out
a
feeler
why
she
said
do
you
think
i
sha
enjoy
myself
he
laughed
comfortably
putting
the
marmalade
thick
on
his
bread
i
hope
so
he
said
she
again
took
no
notice
of
him
but
do
say
anything
about
it
in
the
village
frank
she
said
casually
do
say
who
i
am
or
that
i
used
to
live
here
nobody
i
want
to
meet
particularly
and
we
should
never
feel
free
if
they
knew
me
why
did
you
come
then
ca
you
understand
why
not
if
you
do
want
to
know
i
came
to
see
the
place
not
the
he
did
not
say
any
more
women
she
said
are
different
from
men
i
do
know
why
i
wanted
to
i
she
helped
him
to
another
cup
of
coffee
solicitously
only
she
resumed
do
talk
about
me
in
the
she
laughed
shakily
i
do
want
my
past
brought
up
against
me
you
and
she
moved
the
crumbs
on
the
cloth
with
her
he
looked
at
her
as
he
drank
his
coffee
he
sucked
his
moustache
and
putting
down
his
cup
said
phlegmatically
i
bet
you
had
a
lot
of
she
looked
with
a
little
guiltiness
that
flattered
him
down
at
the
tablecloth
well
she
said
caressive
you
wo
give
me
away
who
i
am
will
you
no
he
said
comforting
laughing
i
wo
give
you
he
was
pleased
she
remained
silent
after
a
moment
or
two
she
lifted
her
head
saying
i
got
to
arrange
with
mrs
coates
and
do
various
things
so
better
go
out
by
yourself
this
we
be
in
to
dinner
at
but
you
ca

arranging
with
mrs
coates
all

he
said
oh

letters
to
write
and
i
must
get
that
mark
out
of
my
skirt
i
got
plenty
of
little
things
to
do
this
morning
better
go
out
by
he
perceived
that
she
wanted
to
be
rid
of
him
so
that
when
she
went
upstairs
he
took
his
hat
and
lounged
out
on
to
the
cliffs
suppressedly
angry
presently
she
too
came
out
she
wore
a
hat
with
roses
and
a
long
lace
scarf
hung
over
her
white
dress
rather
nervously
she
put
up
her
sunshade
and
her
face
was
in
its
coloured
shadow
she
went
along
the
narrow
track
of
that
were
worn
hollow
by
the
feet
of
the
fishermen
she
seemed
to
be
avoiding
her
surroundings
as
if
she
remained
safe
in
the
little
obscurity
of
her
parasol
she
passed
the
church
and
went
down
the
lane
till
she
came
to
a
high
wall
by
the
wayside
under
this
she
went
slowly
stopping
at
length
by
an
open
doorway
which
shone
like
a
picture
of
light
in
the
dark
wall
there
in
the
magic
beyond
the
doorway
patterns
of
shadow
lay
on
the
sunny
court
on
the
blue
and
white
of
its
paving
while
a
green
lawn
glowed
beyond
where
a
bay
tree
glittered
at
the
edges
she
tiptoed
nervously
into
the
courtyard
glancing
at
the
house
that
stood
in
shadow
the
uncurtained
windows
looked
black
and
soulless
the
kitchen
door
stood
open
irresolutely
she
took
a
step
forward
and
again
forward
leaning
yearning
towards
the
garden
beyond
she
had
almost
gained
the
corner
of
the
house
when
a
heavy
step
came
crunching
through
the
trees
a
gardener
appeared
before
her
he
held
a
wicker
tray
on
which
were
rolling
great
dark
red
gooseberries
overripe
he
moved
slowly
the
garden
is
open
today
he
said
quietly
to
the
attractive
woman
who
was
poised
for
retreat
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
with
surprise
how
should
it
be
public
at
all
when
is
it
open
she
asked
the
rector
lets
visitors
in
on
fridays
and
she
stood
still
reflecting
how
strange
to
think
of
the
rector
opening
his
garden
to
the
public
but
everybody
will
be
at
church
she
said
coaxingly
to
the
man
there
be
nobody
here
will
there
he
moved
and
the
big
gooseberries
rolled
the
rector
lives
at
the
new
rectory
he
said
the
two
stood
still
he
did
not
like
to
ask
her
to
go
at
last
she
turned
to
him
with
a
winning
smile
might
i
have
one
peep
at
the
roses
she
coaxed
with
pretty
wilfulness
i
do
suppose
it
would
matter
he
said
moving
aside
you
stop
she
went
forward
forgetting
the
gardener
in
a
moment
her
face
became
strained
her
movements
eager
glancing
round
she
saw
all
the
windows
giving
on
to
the
lawn
were
curtainless
and
dark
the
house
had
a
sterile
appearance
as
if
it
were
still
used
but
not
inhabited
a
shadow
seemed
to
go
over
her
she
went
across
the
lawn
towards
the
garden
through
an
arch
of
crimson
ramblers
a
gate
of
colour
there
beyond
lay
the
soft
blue
sea
with
the
bay
misty
with
morning
and
the
farthest
headland
of
black
rock
jutting
dimly
out
between
blue
and
blue
of
the
sky
and
water
her
face
began
to
shine
transfigured
with
pain
and
joy
at
her
feet
the
garden
fell
steeply
all
a
confusion
of
flowers
and
away
below
was
the
darkness
of
covering
the
beck
she
turned
to
the
garden
that
shone
with
sunny
flowers
around
her
she
knew
the
little
corner
where
was
the
seat
beneath
the
yew
tree
then
there
was
the
terrace
where
a
great
host
of
flowers
shone
and
from
this
two
paths
went
down
one
at
each
side
of
the
garden
she
closed
her
sunshade
and
walked
slowly
among
the
many
flowers
all
round
were
rose
bushes
big
banks
of
roses
then
roses
hanging
and
tumbling
from
pillars
or
roses
balanced
on
the
standard
bushes
by
the
open
earth
were
many
other
flowers
if
she
lifted
her
head
the
sea
was
upraised
beyond
and
the
cape
slowly
she
went
down
one
path
lingering
like
one
who
has
gone
back
into
the
past
suddenly
she
was
touching
some
heavy
crimson
roses
that
were
soft
as
velvet
touching
them
thoughtfully
without
knowing
as
a
mother
sometimes
fondles
the
hand
of
her
child
she
leaned
slightly
forward
to
catch
the
scent
then
she
wandered
on
in
abstraction
sometimes
a
scentless
rose
would
hold
her
arrested
she
stood
gazing
at
it
as
if
she
could
not
understand
it
again
the
same
softness
of
intimacy
came
over
her
as
she
stood
before
a
tumbling
heap
of
pink
petals
then
she
wondered
over
the
white
rose
that
was
greenish
like
ice
in
the
centre
so
slowly
like
a
white
pathetic
butterfly
she
drifted
down
the
path
coming
at
last
to
a
tiny
terrace
all
full
of
roses
they
seemed
to
fill
the
place
a
sunny
gay
throng
she
was
shy
of
them
they
were
so
many
and
so
bright
they
seemed
to
be
conversing
and
laughing
she
felt
herself
in
a
strange
crowd
it
exhilarated
her
carried
her
out
of
herself
she
flushed
with
excitement
the
air
was
pure
scent
hastily
she
went
to
a
little
seat
among
the
white
roses
and
sat
down
her
scarlet
sunshade
made
a
hard
blot
of
colour
she
sat
quite
still
feeling
her
own
existence
lapse
she
was
no
more
than
a
rose
a
rose
that
could
not
quite
come
into
blossom
but
remained
tense
a
little
fly
dropped
on
her
knee
on
her
white
dress
she
watched
it
as
if
it
had
fallen
on
a
rose
she
was
not
herself
then
she
started
cruelly
as
a
shadow
crossed
her
and
a
figure
moved
into
her
sight
it
was
a
man
who
had
come
in
slippers
unheard
he
wore
a
linen
coat
the
morning
was
shattered
the
spell
vanished
away
she
was
only
afraid
of
being
questioned
he
came
forward
she
rose
then
seeing
him
the
strength
went
from
her
and
she
sank
on
the
seat
again
he
was
a
young
man
military
in
appearance
growing
slightly
stout
his
black
hair
was
brushed
smooth
and
bright
his
moustache
was
waxed
but
there
was
something
rambling
in
his
gait
she
looked
up
blanched
to
the
lips
and
saw
his
eyes
they
were
black
and
stared
without
seeing
they
were
not
a
man
eyes
he
was
coming
towards
her
he
stared
at
her
fixedly
made
unconscious
salute
and
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
seat
he
moved
on
the
bench
shifted
his
feet
saying
in
a
gentlemanly
military
voice
i
do
disturb
i
she
was
mute
and
helpless
he
was
scrupulously
dressed
in
dark
clothes
and
a
linen
coat
she
could
not
move
seeing
his
hands
with
the
ring
she
knew
so
well
upon
the
little
finger
she
felt
as
if
she
were
going
dazed
the
whole
world
was
deranged
she
sat
unavailing
for
his
hands
her
symbols
of
passionate
love
filled
her
with
horror
as
they
rested
now
on
his
strong
thighs
may
i
smoke
he
asked
intimately
almost
secretly
his
hand
going
to
his
pocket
she
could
not
answer
but
it
did
not
matter
he
was
in
another
world
she
wondered
craving
if
he
recognized
he
could
recognize
her
she
sat
pale
with
anguish
but
she
had
to
go
through
it
i
have
got
any
tobacco
he
said
thoughtfully
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
his
words
only
she
attended
to
him
could
he
recognize
her
or
was
it
all
gone
she
sat
still
in
a
frozen
kind
of
suspense
i
smoke
john
cotton
he
said
and
i
must
economize
with
it
it
is
expensive
you
know
i
not
very
well
off
while
these
lawsuits
are
going
no
she
said
and
her
heart
was
cold
her
soul
kept
rigid
he
moved
made
a
loose
salute
rose
and
went
away
she
sat
motionless
she
could
see
his
shape
the
shape
she
had
loved
with
all
her
passion
his
compact
soldier
head
his
fine
figure
now
slackened
and
it
was
not
he
it
only
filled
her
with
horror
too
difficult
to
know
suddenly
he
came
again
his
hand
in
his
jacket
pocket
do
you
mind
if
i
smoke
he
said
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
see
things
more
he
sat
down
beside
her
again
filling
a
pipe
she
watched
his
hands
with
the
fine
strong
fingers
they
had
always
inclined
to
tremble
slightly
it
had
surprised
her
long
ago
in
such
a
healthy
man
now
they
moved
inaccurately
and
the
tobacco
hung
raggedly
out
of
the
pipe
i
have
legal
business
to
attend
to
legal
affairs
are
always
so
uncertain
i
tell
my
solicitor
exactly
precisely
what
i
want
but
i
can
never
get
it
she
sat
and
heard
him
talking
but
it
was
not
he
yet
those
were
the
hands
she
had
kissed
there
were
the
glistening
strange
black
eyes
that
she
had
loved
yet
it
was
not
he
she
sat
motionless
with
horror
and
silence
he
dropped
his
tobacco
pouch
and
groped
for
it
on
the
ground
yet
she
must
wait
if
he
would
recognize
her
why
could
she
not
go
in
a
moment
he
rose
i
must
go
at
once
he
said
the
owl
is
then
he
added
confidentially
his
name
is
really
the
owl
but
i
call
him
that
i
must
go
and
see
if
he
has
she
rose
too
he
stood
before
her
uncertain
he
was
a
handsome
soldierly
fellow
and
a
lunatic
her
eyes
searched
him
and
searched
him
to
see
if
he
would
recognize
her
if
she
could
discover
him
you
do
know
me
she
asked
from
the
terror
of
her
soul
standing
alone
he
looked
back
at
her
quizzically
she
had
to
bear
his
eyes
they
gleamed
on
her
but
with
no
intelligence
he
was
drawing
nearer
to
her
yes
i
do
know
you
he
said
fixed
intent
but
mad
drawing
his
face
nearer
hers
her
horror
was
too
great
the
powerful
lunatic
was
coming
too
near
to
her
a
man
approached
hastening
the
garden
is
open
this
morning
he
said
the
deranged
man
stopped
and
looked
at
him
the
keeper
went
to
the
seat
and
picked
up
the
tobacco
pouch
left
lying
there
do
leave
your
tobacco
sir
he
said
taking
it
to
the
gentleman
in
the
linen
coat
i
was
just
asking
this
lady
to
stay
to
lunch
the
latter
said
politely
she
is
a
friend
of
the
woman
turned
and
walked
swiftly
blindly
between
the
sunny
roses
out
of
the
garden
past
the
house
with
the
blank
dark
windows
through
the
courtyard
to
the
street
hastening
and
blind
she
went
forward
without
hesitating
not
knowing
whither
directly
she
came
to
the
house
she
went
upstairs
took
off
her
hat
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
it
was
as
if
some
membrane
had
been
torn
in
two
in
her
so
that
she
was
not
an
entity
that
could
think
and
feel
she
sat
staring
across
at
the
window
where
an
ivy
spray
waved
slowly
up
and
down
in
the
sea
wind
there
was
some
of
the
uncanny
luminousness
of
the
sunlit
sea
in
the
air
she
sat
perfectly
still
without
any
being
she
only
felt
she
might
be
sick
and
it
might
be
blood
that
was
loose
in
her
torn
entrails
she
sat
perfectly
still
and
passive
after
a
time
she
heard
the
hard
tread
of
her
husband
on
the
floor
below
and
without
herself
changing
she
registered
his
movement
she
heard
his
rather
disconsolate
footsteps
go
out
again
then
his
voice
speaking
answering
growing
cheery
and
his
solid
tread
drawing
near
he
entered
ruddy
rather
pleased
an
air
of
complacency
about
his
alert
figure
she
moved
stiffly
he
faltered
in
his
approach
what
the
matter
he
asked
a
tinge
of
impatience
in
his
voice
are
you
feeling
well
this
was
torture
to
her
quite
she
replied
his
brown
eyes
became
puzzled
and
angry
what
is
the
matter
he
said
he
took
a
few
strides
and
stood
obstinately
looking
out
of
the
window
have
you
run
up
against
anybody
he
asked
nobody
who
knows
me
she
said
his
hands
began
to
twitch
it
exasperated
him
that
she
was
no
more
sensible
of
him
than
if
he
did
not
exist
turning
on
her
at
length
driven
he
asked
something
has
upset
you
has
it
no
why
she
said
neutral
he
did
not
exist
for
her
except
as
an
irritant
his
anger
rose
filling
the
veins
in
his
throat
it
seems
like
it
he
said
making
an
effort
not
to
show
his
anger
because
there
seemed
no
reason
for
it
he
went
away
downstairs
she
sat
still
on
the
bed
and
with
the
residue
of
feeling
left
to
her
she
disliked
him
because
he
tormented
her
the
time
went
by
she
could
smell
the
dinner
being
served
the
smoke
of
her
husband
pipe
from
the
garden
but
she
could
not
move
she
had
no
being
there
was
a
tinkle
of
the
bell
she
heard
him
come
indoors
and
then
he
mounted
the
stairs
again
at
every
step
her
heart
grew
tight
in
her
he
opened
the
door
dinner
is
on
the
table
he
said
it
was
difficult
for
her
to
endure
his
presence
for
he
would
interfere
with
her
she
could
not
recover
her
life
she
rose
stiffly
and
went
down
she
could
neither
eat
nor
talk
during
the
meal
she
sat
absent
torn
without
any
being
of
her
own
he
tried
to
go
on
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
but
at
last
he
became
silent
with
fury
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
she
went
upstairs
again
and
locked
the
bedroom
door
she
must
be
alone
he
went
with
his
pipe
into
the
garden
all
his
suppressed
anger
against
her
who
held
herself
superior
to
him
filled
and
blackened
his
heart
though
he
had
not
know
it
yet
he
had
never
really
won
her
she
had
never
loved
him
she
had
taken
him
on
sufference
this
had
foiled
him
he
was
only
a
labouring
electrician
in
the
mine
she
was
superior
to
him
he
had
always
given
way
to
her
but
all
the
while
the
injury
and
ignominy
had
been
working
in
his
soul
because
she
did
not
hold
him
seriously
and
now
all
his
rage
came
up
against
her
he
turned
and
went
indoors
the
third
time
she
heard
him
mounting
the
stairs
her
heart
stood
still
he
turned
the
catch
and
pushed
the
was
locked
he
tried
it
again
harder
her
heart
was
standing
still
have
you
fastened
the
door
he
asked
quietly
because
of
the
landlady
yes
wait
a
she
rose
and
turned
the
lock
afraid
he
would
burst
it
she
felt
hatred
towards
him
because
he
did
not
leave
her
free
he
entered
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
and
she
returned
to
her
old
position
on
the
bed
he
closed
the
door
and
stood
with
his
back
to
it
what
the
matter
he
asked
determinedly
she
was
sick
with
him
she
could
not
look
at
him
ca
you
leave
me
alone
she
replied
averting
her
face
from
him
he
looked
at
her
quickly
fully
wincing
with
ignominy
then
he
seemed
to
consider
for
a
moment
there
something
up
with
you
is
there
he
asked
definitely
yes
she
said
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
torment
i
do
torment
you
what
the
matter
why
should
you
know
she
cried
in
hate
and
desperation
something
snapped
he
started
and
caught
his
pipe
as
it
fell
from
his
mouth
then
he
pushed
forward
the
with
his
tongue
took
it
from
off
his
lips
and
looked
at
it
then
he
put
out
his
pipe
and
brushed
the
ash
from
his
waistcoat
after
which
he
raised
his
head
i
want
to
know
he
said
his
face
was
greyish
pale
and
set
uglily
neither
looked
at
the
other
she
knew
he
was
fired
now
his
heart
was
pounding
heavily
she
hated
him
but
she
could
not
withstand
him
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
and
turned
on
him
what
right
have
you
to
know
she
asked
he
looked
at
her
she
felt
a
pang
of
surprise
for
his
tortured
eyes
and
his
fixed
face
but
her
heart
hardened
swiftly
she
had
never
loved
him
she
did
not
love
him
now
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
again
swiftly
like
a
thing
that
tries
to
get
free
she
wanted
to
be
free
of
it
it
was
not
him
so
much
but
it
something
she
had
put
on
herself
that
bound
her
so
horribly
and
having
put
the
bond
on
herself
it
was
hardest
to
take
it
off
but
now
she
hated
everything
and
felt
destructive
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
fixed
as
if
he
would
oppose
her
eternally
till
she
was
extinguished
she
looked
at
him
her
eyes
were
cold
and
hostile
his
workman
hands
spread
on
the
panels
of
the
door
behind
him
you
know
i
used
to
live
here
she
began
in
a
hard
voice
as
if
wilfully
to
wound
him
he
braced
himself
against
her
and
nodded
well
i
was
companion
to
miss
birch
of
torril
and
the
rector
were
friends
and
archie
was
the
rector
there
was
a
pause
he
listened
without
knowing
what
was
happening
he
stared
at
his
wife
she
was
squatted
in
her
white
dress
on
the
bed
carefully
folding
and
the
hem
of
her
skirt
her
voice
was
full
of
hostility
he
was
an
he
quarrelled
with
his
colonel
and
came
out
of
the
army
at
any
rate
plucked
at
her
skirt
hem
her
husband
stood
motionless
watching
her
movements
which
filled
his
veins
with
he
was
awfully
fond
of
me
and
i
was
of
how
old
was
he
asked
the
husband
i
first
knew
him
or
when
he
went
away
when
you
first
knew
when
i
first
knew
him
he
was
i
and
he
is
nearly
three
years
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
the
opposite
wall
and
what
then
said
her
husband
she
hardened
herself
and
said
callously
we
were
as
good
as
engaged
for
nearly
a
year
though
nobody
was
open
then
he
went
he
chucked
you
said
the
husband
brutally
wanting
to
hurt
her
into
contact
with
himself
her
heart
rose
wildly
with
rage
then
yes
she
said
to
anger
him
he
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
giving
a
ph
of
rage
there
was
silence
for
a
time
then
she
resumed
her
pain
giving
a
mocking
note
to
her
words
he
suddenly
went
out
to
fight
in
africa
and
almost
the
very
day
i
first
met
you
i
heard
from
miss
birch
he
got
two
months
after
that
he
was
that
was
before
you
took
on
with
me
said
the
husband
there
was
no
answer
neither
spoke
for
a
time
he
had
not
understood
his
eyes
were
contracted
uglily
so
you
been
looking
at
your
old
courting
places
he
said
that
was
what
you
wanted
to
go
out
by
yourself
for
this
still
she
did
not
answer
him
anything
he
went
away
from
the
door
to
the
window
he
stood
with
his
hands
behind
him
his
back
to
her
she
looked
at
him
his
hands
seemed
gross
to
her
the
back
of
his
head
paltry
at
length
almost
against
his
will
he
turned
round
asking
how
long
were
you
carrying
on
with
him
what
do
you
mean
she
replied
coldly
i
mean
how
long
were
you
carrying
on
with
him
she
lifted
her
head
averting
her
face
from
him
she
refused
to
answer
then
she
said
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
carrying
on
i
loved
him
from
the
first
days
i
met
months
after
i
went
to
stay
with
miss
and
do
you
reckon
he
loved
you
he
jeered
i
know
he
how
do
you
know
if
he
have
no
more
to
do
with
you
there
was
a
long
silence
of
hate
and
suffering
and
how
far
did
it
go
between
you
he
asked
at
length
in
a
frightened
stiff
voice
i
hate
your
questions
she
cried
beside
herself
with
his
baiting
we
loved
each
other
and
we
were
were
i
do
care
what
you
think
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
it
we
were
lovers
before
ever
i
knew
he
said
white
with
fury
you
mean
you
had
your
fling
with
an
army
man
and
then
came
to
me
to
marry
you
when
you
she
sat
swallowing
her
bitterness
there
was
a
long
pause
do
you
mean
to
say
you
used
to
whole
hogger
he
asked
still
incredulous
why
what
else
do
you
think
i
mean
she
cried
brutally
he
shrank
and
became
white
impersonal
there
was
a
long
paralysed
silence
he
seemed
to
have
gone
small
you
never
thought
to
tell
me
all
this
before
i
married
you
he
said
with
bitter
irony
at
last
you
never
asked
me
she
replied
i
never
thought
there
was
any
well
then
you
should
he
stood
with
expressionless
almost
childlike
set
face
revolving
many
thoughts
whilst
his
heart
was
mad
with
anguish
suddenly
she
added
and
i
saw
him
today
she
said
he
is
not
dead
he
her
husband
looked
at
her
startled
mad
he
said
involuntarily
a
lunatic
she
said
it
almost
cost
her
her
reason
to
utter
the
word
there
was
a
pause
did
he
know
you
asked
the
husband
in
a
small
voice
no
she
said
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
at
last
he
had
learned
the
width
of
the
breach
between
them
she
still
squatted
on
the
bed
he
could
not
go
near
her
it
would
be
violation
to
each
of
them
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
the
other
the
thing
must
work
itself
out
they
were
both
shocked
so
much
they
were
impersonal
and
no
longer
hated
each
other
after
some
minutes
he
left
her
and
went
out
goose
fair
i
through
the
gloom
of
evening
and
the
flare
of
torches
of
the
night
before
the
fair
through
the
still
fogs
of
the
succeeding
dawn
came
paddling
the
weary
geese
lifting
their
poor
feet
that
had
been
dipped
in
tar
for
shoes
and
trailing
them
along
the
into
the
town
last
of
all
in
the
afternoon
a
country
girl
drove
in
her
dozen
birds
disconsolate
because
she
was
so
late
she
was
a
heavily
built
girl
fair
with
regular
features
and
yet
unprepossessing
she
needed
chiselling
down
her
contours
were
brutal
perhaps
it
was
weariness
that
hung
her
eyelids
a
little
lower
than
was
pleasant
when
she
spoke
to
her
clumsily
lagging
birds
it
was
in
a
snarling
nasal
tone
one
of
the
silly
things
sat
down
in
the
gutter
and
refused
to
move
it
looked
very
ridiculous
but
also
rather
pitiful
squat
there
with
its
head
up
refusing
to
be
urged
on
by
the
ungentle
toe
of
the
girl
the
latter
swore
heavily
then
picked
up
the
great
complaining
bird
and
fronting
her
road
stubbornly
drove
on
the
lamentable
eleven
no
one
had
noticed
her
this
afternoon
the
women
were
not
sitting
chatting
on
their
doorsteps
seaming
up
the
cotton
hose
or
swiftly
passing
through
their
fingers
the
piled
white
lace
and
in
the
high
dark
houses
the
song
of
the
hosiery
frames
was
hushed
as
she
dragged
up
hollow
stone
people
returned
from
the
fair
chaffed
her
and
asked
her
what
it
was
she
did
not
reply
her
look
was
sullen
the
lace
market
was
quiet
as
the
sabbath
even
the
great
brass
plates
on
the
doors
were
dull
with
neglect
there
seemed
an
afternoon
atmosphere
of
raw
discontent
the
girl
stopped
a
moment
before
the
dismal
prospect
of
one
of
the
great
warehouses
that
had
been
gutted
with
fire
she
looked
at
the
lean
threatening
walls
and
watched
her
white
flock
waddling
in
reckless
misery
below
and
she
would
have
laughed
out
loud
had
the
wall
fallen
flat
upon
them
and
relieved
her
of
them
but
the
wall
did
not
fall
so
she
crossed
the
road
and
walking
on
the
safe
side
hurried
after
her
charge
her
look
was
even
more
sullen
she
remembered
the
state
of
the
invidious
enemy
trade
which
thrust
out
its
hand
and
shut
the
factory
doors
and
pulled
the
stockingers
off
their
seats
and
left
the
web
on
the
frame
trade
which
mysteriously
choked
up
the
sources
of
the
rivulets
of
wealth
and
blacker
and
more
secret
than
a
pestilence
starved
the
town
through
this
morose
atmosphere
of
bad
trade
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
of
the
fair
the
girl
strode
down
to
the
poultry
with
eleven
sound
geese
and
one
lame
one
to
sell
the
frenchmen
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
so
everybody
said
though
nobody
quite
knew
how
at
any
rate
they
had
gone
to
war
with
the
prussians
and
got
beaten
and
trade
was
ruined
in
nottingham
a
little
fog
rose
up
and
the
twilight
gathered
around
then
they
flared
abroad
their
torches
in
the
fair
insulting
the
night
the
girl
still
sat
in
the
poultry
and
her
weary
geese
unsold
on
the
stones
illuminated
by
the
hissing
lamp
of
a
man
who
sold
rabbits
and
pigeons
and
assorted
ii
in
another
part
of
the
town
near
sneinton
church
another
girl
came
to
the
door
to
look
at
the
night
she
was
tall
and
slender
dressed
with
the
severe
accuracy
which
marks
the
girl
of
superior
culture
her
hair
was
arranged
with
simplicity
about
the
long
pale
cleanly
cut
face
she
leaned
forward
very
slightly
to
glance
down
the
street
listening
she
very
carefully
preserved
the
appearance
of
having
come
quite
casually
to
the
door
yet
she
lingered
and
lingered
and
stood
very
still
to
listen
when
she
heard
a
footstep
but
when
it
proved
to
be
only
a
common
man
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
and
looked
with
a
small
smile
over
his
head
he
hesitated
to
glance
into
the
open
hall
lighted
so
spaciously
with
a
lamp
and
at
the
slim
girl
in
brown
silk
lifted
up
before
the
light
but
she
she
looked
over
his
head
he
passed
on
presently
she
started
and
hung
in
suspense
somebody
was
crossing
the
road
she
ran
down
the
steps
in
a
pretty
welcome
not
effuse
saying
in
quick
but
accurately
articulated
words
will
i
began
to
think
gone
to
the
fair
i
came
out
to
listen
to
it
i
felt
almost
sure
gone
you
coming
in
are
you
she
waited
a
moment
anxiously
we
expect
you
to
dinner
you
know
she
added
wistfully
the
man
who
had
a
short
face
and
spoke
with
his
lip
curling
up
on
one
side
in
a
drawling
speech
with
ironically
exaggerated
intonation
replied
after
a
short
hesitation
i
awfully
sorry
i
am
straight
lois
it
a
shame
i
got
to
go
round
to
the
biz
man
devil
he
turned
aside
with
irony
in
the
darkness
but
surely
will
remonstrated
the
girl
keenly
disappointed
fact
lois
feel
wild
about
it
myself
but
i
got
to
go
down
to
the
works
they
may
be
getting
a
bit
warm
down
there
you
know
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
fair
if
the
lambs
get
frisky
a
bit
off
about
the
work
and
they
just
be
in
their
element
if
they
could
set
a
lighted
match
to
will
you
do
exclaimed
the
girl
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
in
the
true
fashion
of
romance
and
looking
up
at
him
earnestly
dad
not
sure
he
replied
looking
down
at
her
with
gravity
they
remained
in
this
attitude
for
a
moment
then
he
said
i
might
stop
a
bit
it
all
right
for
an
hour
i
should
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
then
said
in
tones
of
deep
disappointment
and
of
fortitude
no
will
you
must
go
you
better
it
a
shame
he
murmured
standing
a
moment
at
a
loose
end
then
glancing
down
the
street
to
see
he
was
alone
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
said
in
a
difficult
voice
how
goes
it
she
let
him
keep
her
for
a
moment
then
he
kissed
her
as
if
afraid
of
what
he
was
doing
they
were
both
uncomfortable
he
said
at
length
good
night
she
said
setting
him
free
to
go
he
hung
a
moment
near
her
as
if
ashamed
then
good
night
he
answered
and
he
broke
away
she
listened
to
his
footsteps
in
the
night
before
composing
herself
to
turn
indoors
helloa
said
her
father
glancing
over
his
paper
as
she
entered
the
what
up
then
oh
nothing
she
replied
in
her
calm
tones
will
wo
be
here
to
dinner
what
gone
to
the
fair
oh
what

him
then
lois
looked
at
her
father
and
answered
he
gone
down
to
the
factory
they
are
afraid
of
the
her
father
looked
at
her
closely
oh
aye
he
answered
undecided
and
they
sat
down
to
dinner
iii
lois
retired
very
early
she
had
a
fire
in
her
bedroom
she
drew
the
curtains
and
stood
holding
aside
a
heavy
fold
looking
out
at
the
night
she
could
see
only
the
nothingness
of
the
fog
not
even
the
glare
of
the
fair
was
evident
though
the
noise
clamoured
small
in
the
distance
in
front
of
everything
she
could
see
her
own
faint
image
she
crossed
to
the
and
there
leaned
her
face
to
the
mirror
and
looked
at
herself
she
looked
a
long
time
then
she
rose
changed
her
dress
for
a
and
took
up
sesame
and
lilies
late
in
the
night
she
was
roused
from
sleep
by
a
bustle
in
the
house
she
sat
up
and
heard
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
the
sound
of
anxious
voices
she
put
on
her
and
went
out
to
her
mother
room
seeing
her
mother
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
said
in
her
quick
clean
voice
mother

it
oh
child

me

jack

lois
returned
to
her
bedroom
and
dressed
she
coiled
her
plaited
hair
and
having
put
on
a
cloak
left
the
house
she
hurried
along
under
the
trees
towards
the
meaner
part
of
the
town
when
she
got
near
she
saw
a
glare
in
the
fog
and
closed
her
lips
tight
she
hastened
on
till
she
was
in
the
crowd
with
peaked
noble
face
she
watched
the
fire
then
she
looked
a
little
wildly
over
the
faces
in
the
crowd
and
catching
sight
of
her
father
hurried
to
him
oh
he
safe
is
will
safe
aye
why
not
you
no
business
here

here
sampson

take

place
to

will
she
asked
go
just
take
miss
lois
you
do
really
know
where
he
go
home
do
want
you
her
father
ordered
peremptorily
the
tears
sprang
to
lois
eyes
she
looked
at
the
fire
and
the
tears
were
quickly
dried
by
fear
the
flames
roared
and
struggled
upward
the
great
wonder
of
the
fire
made
her
forget
even
her
indignation
at
her
father
light
treatment
of
herself
and
of
her
lover
there
was
a
crashing
and
bursting
of
timber
as
the
first
floor
fell
in
a
mass
into
the
blazing
gulf
splashing
the
fire
in
all
directions
to
the
terror
of
the
crowd
she
saw
the
steel
of
the
machines
growing
and
twisting
like
flaming
letters
piece
after
piece
of
the
flooring
gave
way
and
the
machines
dropped
in
red
ruin
as
the
wooden
framework
burned
out
the
air
became
unbreathable
the
fog
was
swallowed
up
sparks
went
rushing
up
as
if
they
would
burn
the
dark
heavens
sometimes
cards
of
lace
went
whirling
into
the
gulf
of
the
sky
waving
with
wings
of
fire
it
was
dangerous
to
stand
near
this
great
cup
of
roaring
destruction
sampson
the
grey
old
manager
of
buxton
and
co
led
her
away
as
soon
as
she
would
turn
her
face
to
listen
to
him
he
was
a
stout
irritable
man
he
elbowed
his
way
roughly
through
the
crowd
and
lois
followed
him
her
head
high
her
lips
closed
he
led
her
for
some
distance
without
speaking
then
at
last
unable
to
contain
his
garrulous
irritability
he
broke
out
what
do
they
expect
what
can
they
expect
they
ca
expect
to
stand
a
bad
time
they
spring
up
like
mushrooms
as
big
as
a
but
there
no
stability
in
i
remember
william
selby
when
he
run
on
my
errands
yes
there
some
as
can
make
much
out
of
little
and
there
some
as
can
make
much
out
of
nothing
but
they
find
it
last
william
selby
sprung
up
in
a
day
and
he
vanish
in
a
night
you
ca
trust
to
luck
alone
maybe
he
thinks
it
a
lucky
thing
this
fire
has
come
when
things
are
looking
black
but
you
ca
get
out
of
it
as
easy
as
that
there
been
a
few
too
many
of
no
indeed
a
fire
the
last
thing
i
should
hope
to
come
very
last
lois
hurried
and
hurried
so
that
she
brought
the
old
manager
panting
in
distress
up
the
steps
of
her
home
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
talking
so
they
could
get
no
one
to
open
the
door
for
some
time
when
at
last
lois
ran
upstairs
she
found
her
mother
dressed
but
all
unbuttoned
again
lying
back
in
the
chair
in
her
daughter
room
suffering
from
palpitation
of
the
heart
with
sesame
and
lilies
crushed
beneath
her
lois
administered
brandy
and
her
decisive
words
and
movements
helped
largely
to
bring
the
good
lady
to
a
state
of
recovery
sufficient
to
allow
of
her
returning
to
her
own
bedroom
then
lois
locked
the
door
she
glanced
at
her
face
and
taking
the
flattened
ruskin
out
of
the
chair
sat
down
and
wept
after
a
while
she
calmed
herself
rose
and
sponged
her
face
then
once
more
on
that
fatal
night
she
prepared
for
rest
instead
however
or
retiring
she
pulled
a
silk
quilt
from
her
disordered
bed
and
wrapping
it
round
her
sat
miserably
to
think
it
was
two
in
the
morning
iv
the
fire
was
sunk
to
cold
ashes
in
the
grate
and
the
grey
morning
was
creeping
through
the
curtains
like
a
thing
ashamed
when
lois
awoke
it
was
painful
to
move
her
head
her
neck
was
cramped
the
girl
awoke
in
full
recollection
she
sighed
roused
herself
and
pulled
the
quilt
closer
about
her
for
a
little
while
she
sat
and
mused
a
pale
tragic
resignation
fixed
her
face
like
a
mask
she
remembered
her
father
irritable
answer
to
her
question
concerning
her
safe
not
she
knew
that
he
suspected
the
factory
of
having
been
purposely
set
on
fire
but
then
he
had
never
liked
will
and
heart
was
heavy
as
lead
she
felt
her
lover
was
guilty
and
she
felt
she
must
hide
her
secret
of
his
last
communication
to
her
she
saw
herself
being
when
did
you
last
see
this
man
but
she
would
hide
what
he
had
said
about
watching
at
the
works
how
dreary
it
how
dreadful
her
life
was
ruined
now
and
nothing
mattered
any
more
she
must
only
behave
with
dignity
and
submit
to
her
own
obliteration
for
even
if
will
were
never
accused
she
knew
in
her
heart
he
was
guilty
she
knew
it
was
over
between
them
it
was
dawn
among
the
yellow
fog
outside
and
lois
as
she
moved
mechanically
about
her
toilet
vaguely
felt
that
all
her
days
would
arrive
slowly
struggling
through
a
bleak
fog
she
felt
an
intense
longing
at
this
uncanny
hour
to
slough
the
body
trammelled
weariness
and
to
issue
at
once
into
the
new
bright
warmth
of
the
far
dawn
where
a
lover
waited
transfigured
it
is
so
easy
and
pleasant
in
imagination
to
step
out
of
the
chill
grey
dampness
of
another
terrestrial
daybreak
straight
into
the
sunshine
of
the
eternal
morning
and
who
can
escape
his
hour
so
lois
performed
the
meaningless
routine
of
her
toilet
which
at
last
she
made
meaningful
when
she
took
her
black
dress
and
fastened
a
black
jet
brooch
at
her
throat
then
she
went
downstairs
and
found
her
father
eating
a
mutton
chop
she
quickly
approached
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
then
she
retreated
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
her
father
looked
tired
even
haggard
you
are
early
he
said
after
a
while
lois
did
not
reply
her
father
continued
to
eat
for
a
few
moments
then
he
said
have
a
one
ring
for
a
hot
plate
eh
what
why
not
lois
was
insulted
but
she
gave
no
sign
she
sat
down
and
took
a
cup
of
coffee
making
no
pretence
to
eat
her
father
was
absorbed
and
had
forgotten
her
our
jack
not
come
home
yet
he
said
at
last
lois
stirred
faintly
has
he
she
said
there
was
silence
for
a
time
lois
was
frightened
had
something
happened
also
to
her
brother
this
fear
was
closer
and
more
irksome
selby
was
cleaned
out
gutted
we
had
a
near
shave
of
you
have
no
loss
dadda
nothing
to
after
another
silence
her
father
said
i
rather
be
myself
than
william
selby
of
course
it
may
merely
be
bad
do
know
but
whatever
it
was
i
would
like
to
add
one
to
the
list
of
fires
just
now
selby
was
at
the
when
it
broke
do
know
where
the
lad
father
broke
in
lois
why
do
you
talk
like
that
why
do
you
talk
as
if
will
had
done
it
she
ended
suddenly
her
father
looked
at
her
pale
mute
face
i
do
talk
as
if
will
had
done
it
he
said
i
do
even
think
feeling
she
was
going
to
cry
lois
rose
and
left
the
room
her
father
sighed
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
whistled
faintly
into
the
fire
he
was
not
thinking
about
her
lois
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
asked
lucy
the
to
go
out
with
her
she
somehow
shrank
from
going
alone
lest
people
should
stare
at
her
overmuch
and
she
felt
an
overpowering
impulse
to
go
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
to
judge
for
herself
the
churches
were
chiming
eight
when
the
young
lady
and
the
maid
set
off
down
the
street
nearer
the
fair
swarthy
men
were
pushing
barrels
of
water
towards
the
and
the
gipsy
women
with
hard
brows
and
dressed
in
tight
velvet
bodices
hurried
along
the
pavement
with
jugs
of
milk
and
great
brass
water
ewers
and
loaves
and
breakfast
parcels
people
were
just
getting
up
and
in
the
poorer
streets
was
a
continual
splash
of
flung
out
on
to
the
a
teapot
came
crashing
down
from
an
upper
story
just
behind
lois
and
she
starting
round
and
looking
up
thought
that
the
trembling
man
at
the
upper
window
who
was
stupidly
staring
after
his
pot
had
had
designs
on
her
life
and
she
went
on
her
way
shuddering
at
the
grim
tragedy
of
life
in
the
dull
october
morning
the
ruined
factory
was
black
and
ghastly
the
were
all
jagged
and
the
walls
stood
gaunt
inside
was
a
tangle
of
twisted
débris
the
iron
in
parts
red
with
bright
rust
looking
still
hot
the
charred
wood
was
black
and
satiny
from
dishevelled
heaps
sodden
with
water
a
faint
smoke
rose
dimly
lois
stood
and
looked
if
he
had
done
that
he
might
even
be
dead
there
burned
to
ash
and
lost
for
ever
it
was
almost
soothing
to
feel
so
he
would
be
safe
in
the
eternity
which
now
she
must
hope
in
at
her
side
the
pretty
sympathetic
maid
chatted
plaintively
suddenly
from
one
of
her
lapses
into
silence
she
exclaimed
why
if
there
is
mr
jack
lois
turned
suddenly
and
saw
her
brother
and
her
lover
approaching
her
both
looked
soiled
untidy
and
wan
will
had
a
black
eye
some
ten
hours
old
well
coloured
lois
turned
very
pale
as
they
approached
they
were
looking
gloomily
at
the
factory
and
for
a
moment
did
not
notice
the
girls
i
be
jiggered
if
there
ai
our
lois
exclaimed
jack
the
reprobate
swearing
under
his
breath
oh
god
exclaimed
the
other
in
disgust
jack
where
have
you
been
said
lois
sharply
in
keen
pain
not
looking
at
her
lover
her
sharp
tone
of
suffering
drove
her
lover
to
defend
himself
with
an
affectation
of
comic
recklessness
in
quod
replied
her
brother
smiling
sickly
jack
cried
his
sister
very
sharply
will
selby
shuffled
on
his
feet
and
smiled
trying
to
turn
away
his
face
so
that
she
should
not
see
his
black
eye
she
glanced
at
him
he
felt
her
boundless
anger
and
contempt
and
with
great
courage
he
looked
straight
at
her
smiling
ironically
unfortunately
his
smile
would
not
go
over
his
swollen
eye
which
remained
grave
and
lurid
do
i
look
pretty
he
inquired
with
a
hateful
twist
of
his
lip
very
she
replied
i
thought
i
did
he
replied
and
he
turned
to
look
at
his
ruined
works
and
he
felt
miserable
and
stubborn
the
girl
standing
there
so
clean
and
out
of
it
all
oh
god
he
felt
sick
he
turned
to
go
home
the
three
went
together
lois
silent
in
anger
and
resentment
her
brother
was
tired
and
overstrung
but
not
suppressed
he
chattered
on
blindly
it
was
a
lark
we
had
we
met
bob
osborne
and
freddy
mansell
coming
down
poultry
there
was
girl
with
some
geese
she
looked
a
tanger
sitting
there
all
like
statues
her
and
the
geese
it
was
will
who
began
it
he
offered
her
and
asked
her
to
begin
the
show
she
called
him
called
him
something
and
then
somebody
poked
an
old
gander
to
stir
him
up
and
somebody
squirted
him
in
the
eye
he
upped
and
squawked
and
started
off
with
his
neck
out
laugh
we
nearly
killed
ourselves
keeping
back
those
old
birds
with
squirts
and
teasers
oh
lum
those
old
geese
oh
scrimmy
they
did
know
where
to
turn
they
fairly
went
off
their
dots
coming
at
us
right
an
left
and
such
a
was
fun
you
never
knew
then
the
girl
she
got
up
and
knocked
somebody
over
the
jaw
and
we
were
right
in
for
it
well
in
the
end
billy
here
got
hold
of
her
round
the
oh
dry
it
up
exclaimed
will
bitterly
jack
looked
at
him
laughed
mirthlessly
and
continued
an
we
said
we
buy
her
birds
so
we
got
hold
of
one
goose
they
took
some
holding
i
can
tell
off
we
set
round
the
fair
billy
leading
with
the
girl
the
bloomin
geese
squawked
an
pecked
thought
i
should
a
died
well
then
we
wanted
the
girl
to
have
her
birds
then
she
fired
up
she
got
some
other
chaps
on
her
side
and
there
was
a
proper
old
row
the
girl
went
tooth
and
nail
for
will
was
dead
set
against
him
she
gave
him
a
black
eye
by
gum
and
we
went
at
it
i
can
tell
you
it
was
a
free
fight
a
beauty
an
we
got
run
in
i
do
know
what
became
of
the
lois
surveyed
the
two
men
there
was
no
glimmer
of
a
smile
on
her
face
though
the
maid
behind
her
was
sniggering
will
was
very
bitter
he
glanced
at
his
sweetheart
and
at
the
ruined
factory
how
dad
taken
it
he
asked
in
a
biting
almost
humble
tone
i
do
know
she
replied
coldly
father
in
an
awful
way
i
believe
everybody
thinks
you
set
the
place
on
lois
drew
herself
up
she
had
delivered
her
blow
she
drew
herself
up
in
cold
condemnation
and
for
a
moment
enjoyed
her
complete
revenge
he
was
despicable
abject
in
his
dishevelled
disfigured
unwashed
condition
aye
well
they
made
a
mistake
for
once
he
replied
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
curiously
enough
they
walked
side
by
side
as
if
they
belonged
to
each
other
she
was
his
she
was
far
from
forgiving
him
but
she
was
still
farther
from
letting
him
go
and
he
walked
at
her
side
like
a
boy
who
had
to
be
punished
before
he
can
be
exonerated
he
submitted
but
there
was
a
genuine
bitter
contempt
in
the
curl
of
his
lip
the
white
stocking
i
i
getting
up
teddilinks
said
mrs
whiston
and
she
sprang
out
of
bed
briskly
what
the
hanover
got
you
asked
whiston
nothing
ca
i
get
up
she
replied
animatedly
it
was
about
seven
scarcely
light
yet
in
the
cold
bedroom
whiston
lay
still
and
looked
at
his
wife
she
was
a
pretty
little
thing
with
her
fleecy
short
black
hair
all
tousled
he
watched
her
as
she
dressed
quickly
flicking
her
small
delightful
limbs
throwing
her
clothes
about
her
her
slovenliness
and
untidiness
did
not
trouble
him
when
she
picked
up
the
edge
of
her
petticoat
ripped
off
a
torn
string
of
white
lace
and
flung
it
on
the
her
careless
abandon
made
his
spirit
glow
she
stood
before
the
mirror
and
roughly
scrambled
together
her
profuse
little
mane
of
hair
he
watched
the
quickness
and
softness
of
her
young
shoulders
calmly
like
a
husband
and
appreciatively
rise
up
she
cried
turning
to
him
with
a
quick
wave
of
her
and
shine
they
had
been
married
two
years
but
still
when
she
had
gone
out
of
the
room
he
felt
as
if
all
his
light
and
warmth
were
taken
away
he
became
aware
of
the
raw
cold
morning
so
he
rose
himself
wondering
casually
what
had
roused
her
so
early
usually
she
lay
in
bed
as
late
as
she
could
whiston
fastened
a
belt
round
his
loins
and
went
downstairs
in
shirt
and
trousers
he
heard
her
singing
in
her
snatchy
fashion
the
stairs
creaked
under
his
weight
he
passed
down
the
narrow
little
passage
which
she
called
a
hall
of
the
seven
and
sixpenny
house
which
was
his
first
home
he
was
a
shapely
young
fellow
of
about
sleepy
now
and
easy
with
he
heard
the
water
drumming
into
the
kettle
and
she
began
to
whistle
he
loved
the
quick
way
she
dodged
the
supper
cups
under
the
tap
to
wash
them
for
breakfast
she
looked
an
untidy
minx
but
she
was
quick
and
handy
enough
teddilinks
she
cried
what
light
a
fire
she
wore
an
old
of
black
silk
pinned
across
her
breast
but
one
of
the
sleeves
coming
unfastened
showed
some
delightful
pink
why
do
you
sew
your
sleeve
up
he
said
suffering
from
the
sight
of
the
exposed
soft
flesh
where
she
cried
peering
round
nuisance
she
said
seeing
the
gap
then
with
light
fingers
went
on
drying
the
cups
the
kitchen
was
of
fair
size
but
gloomy
whiston
poked
out
the
dead
ashes
suddenly
a
thud
was
heard
at
the
door
down
the
passage
i
go
cried
mrs
whiston
and
she
was
gone
down
the
hall
the
postman
was
a
man
who
had
been
a
soldier
he
smiled
broadly
handing
her
some
packages
they
not
forgot
you
he
said
impudently
for
them
she
said
with
a
toss
of
the
head
but
she
was
interested
only
in
her
envelopes
this
morning
the
postman
waited
inquisitively
smiling
in
an
ingratiating
fashion
she
slowly
abstractedly
as
if
she
did
not
know
anyone
was
there
closed
the
door
in
his
face
continuing
to
look
at
the
addresses
on
her
letters
she
tore
open
the
thin
envelope
there
was
a
long
hideous
cartoon
valentine
she
smiled
briefly
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
struggling
with
the
string
of
a
packet
she
opened
a
white
cardboard
box
and
there
lay
a
white
silk
handkerchief
packed
neatly
under
the
paper
lace
of
the
box
and
her
initial
worked
in
heliotrope
fully
displayed
she
smiled
pleasantly
and
gently
put
the
box
aside
the
third
envelope
contained
another
white
a
cotton
handkerchief
neatly
folded
she
shook
it
out
it
was
a
long
white
stocking
but
there
was
a
little
weight
in
the
toe
quickly
she
thrust
down
her
arm
wriggling
her
fingers
into
the
toe
of
the
stocking
and
brought
out
a
small
box
she
peeped
inside
the
box
then
hastily
opened
a
door
on
her
left
hand
and
went
into
the
little
cold
she
had
her
lower
lip
caught
earnestly
between
her
teeth
with
a
little
flash
of
triumph
she
lifted
a
pair
of
pearl
from
the
small
box
and
she
went
to
the
mirror
there
earnestly
she
began
to
hook
them
through
her
ears
looking
at
herself
sideways
in
the
glass
curiously
concentrated
and
intent
she
seemed
as
she
fingered
the
lobes
of
her
ears
her
head
bent
on
one
side
then
the
pearl
dangled
under
her
rosy
small
ears
she
shook
her
head
sharply
to
see
the
swing
of
the
drops
they
went
chill
against
her
neck
in
little
sharp
touches
then
she
stood
still
to
look
at
herself
bridling
her
head
in
the
dignified
fashion
then
she
simpered
at
herself
catching
her
own
eye
she
could
not
help
winking
at
herself
and
laughing
she
turned
to
look
at
the
box
there
was
a
scrap
of
paper
with
this
posy
pearls
may
be
fair
but
thou
art
fairer
wear

the
she
made
a
grimace
and
a
grin
but
she
was
drawn
to
the
mirror
again
to
look
at
her
whiston
had
made
the
fire
burn
so
he
came
to
look
for
her
when
she
heard
him
she
started
round
quickly
guiltily
she
was
watching
him
with
intent
blue
eyes
when
he
appeared
he
did
not
see
much
in
his
warmth
he
gave
her
as
ever
a
feeling
of
warmth
and
slowness
his
eyes
were
very
blue
very
kind
his
manner
simple
what

asked

said
briskly
ostentatiously
turning
to
show
him

silk
handkerchief

thrust
it
under
his
nose

she
said

cried

bet

he
said

she
cried
beginning
to
shake
her
head
then
stopping
because
of
the
he
stood
still

moment
displeased
they

he
said
ted

said

cried
he
looked
round
and
saw
the
white
stocking
lying
on
a
chair
is
this
another
he
said
no
that
a
sample
she
said
there
only
a
and
she
fetched
in
the
long
cartoon
he
stretched
it
out
and
looked
at
it
solemnly
fools
he
said
and
went
out
of
the
room
she
flew
upstairs
and
took
off
the
when
she
returned
he
was
crouched
before
the
fire
blowing
the
coals
the
skin
of
his
face
was
flushed
and
slightly
pitted
as
if
he
had
had
but
his
neck
was
white
and
smooth
and
goodly
she
hung
her
arms
round
his
neck
as
he
crouched
there
and
clung
to
him
he
balanced
on
his
toes
this
fire
a
he
said
and
who
else
is
a
she
said
one
of
us
two
i
know
he
said
and
he
rose
carefully
she
remained
clinging
round
his
neck
so
that
she
was
lifted
off
her
feet
ha
me
she
cried
he
lowered
his
head
and
she
hung
in
the
air
swinging
from
his
neck
laughing
then
she
slipped
off
the
kettle
is
singing
she
sang
flying
for
the
teapot
he
bent
down
again
to
blow
the
fire
the
veins
in
his
neck
stood
out
his
shirt
collar
seemed
too
tight
doctor
wyer
blow
the
fire
puff
puff
puff
she
sang
laughing
he
smiled
at
her
she
was
so
glad
because
of
her
pearl
over
the
breakfast
she
grew
serious
he
did
not
notice
she
became
portentous
in
her
gravity
almost
it
penetrated
through
his
steady
to
irritate
him
teddy
she
said
at
last
what
he
asked
i
told
you
a
lie
she
said
humbly
tragic
his
soul
stirred
uneasily
oh
aye
he
said
casually
she
was
not
satisfied
he
ought
to
be
more
moved
yes
she
said
he
cut
a
piece
of
bread
was
it
a
good
one
he
asked
she
was
piqued
then
she
it
a
good
one
then
she
laughed
no
she
said
it
was
up
to
ah
he
said
easily
but
with
a
steady
strength
of
fondness
for
her
in
his
tone
get
it
out
it
became
a
little
more
difficult
you
know
that
white
stocking
she
said
earnestly
i
told
you
a
lie
it
was
a
sample
it
was
a
a
little
frown
came
on
his
brow
then
what
did
you
invent
it
as
a
sample
for
he
said
but
he
knew
this
weakness
of
hers
the
touch
of
anger
in
his
voice
frightened
her
i
was
afraid
you
be
cross
she
said
pathetically
i
bet
you
were
vastly
afraid
he
said
i
was
there
was
a
pause
he
was
resolving
one
or
two
things
in
his
mind
and
who
sent
it
he
asked
i
can
guess
she
said
though
there
was
a
word
with
she
ran
to
the
and
returned
with
a
slip
of
paper
pearls
may
be
fair
but
thou
art
fairer
wear
these
for
me
and
love
the
he
read
it
twice
then
a
dull
red
flush
came
on
his
face
and
who
do
you
guess
it
is
he
asked
with
a
ringing
of
anger
in
his
voice
i
suspect
it
sam
adams
she
said
with
a
little
virtuous
indignation
whiston
was
silent
for
a
moment
fool
he
said
an
what
it
got
to
do
with
pearls
how
can
he
say
these
for
me
when
there
only
one
he
has
got
the
brain
to
invent
a
proper
he
screwed
the
sup
of
paper
into
a
ball
and
flung
it
into
the
fire
i
suppose
he
thinks
it
make
a
pair
with
the
one
last
year
she
said
why
did
he
send
one
then
yes
i
thought
you
be
wild
if
you
his
jaw
set
rather
sullenly
presently
he
rose
and
went
to
wash
himself
rolling
back
his
sleeves
and
pulling
open
his
shirt
at
the
breast
it
was
as
if
his
fine
temples
and
steady
eyes
were
degraded
by
the
lower
rather
brutal
part
of
his
face
but
she
loved
it
as
she
whisked
about
clearing
the
table
she
loved
the
way
in
which
he
stood
washing
himself
he
was
such
a
man
she
liked
to
see
his
neck
glistening
with
water
as
he
swilled
it
it
amused
her
and
pleased
her
and
thrilled
her
he
was
so
sure
so
permanent
he
had
her
so
utterly
in
his
power
it
gave
her
a
delightful
mischievous
sense
of
liberty
within
his
grasp
she
could
dart
about
excitingly
he
turned
round
to
her
his
face
red
from
the
cold
water
his
eyes
fresh
and
very
blue
you
have
been
seeing
anything
of
him
have
you
he
asked
roughly
yes
she
answered
after
a
moment
as
if
caught
guilty
he
got
into
the
tram
with
me
and
he
asked
me
to
drink
a
coffee
and
a
benedictine
in
the
you
got
it
off
fine
and
glib
he
said
sullenly
and
did
you
yes
she
replied
with
the
air
of
a
traitor
before
the
rack
the
blood
came
up
into
his
neck
and
face
he
stood
motionless
dangerous
it
was
cold
and
it
was
such
fun
to
go
into
the
royal
she
said
you
go
off
with
a
nigger
for
a
packet
of
chocolate
he
said
in
anger
and
contempt
and
some
bitterness
queer
how
he
drew
away
from
her
cut
her
off
from
him
beastly
she
cried
you
know
quite
she
caught
her
lip
flushed
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
he
turned
away
to
put
on
his
necktie
she
went
about
her
work
making
a
queer
pathetic
little
mouth
down
which
occasionally
dripped
a
tear
he
was
ready
to
go
with
his
hat
jammed
down
on
his
head
and
his
overcoat
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
he
came
to
kiss
her
he
would
be
miserable
all
the
day
if
he
went
without
she
allowed
herself
to
be
kissed
her
cheek
was
wet
under
his
lips
and
his
heart
burned
she
hurt
him
so
deeply
and
she
felt
aggrieved
and
did
not
quite
forgive
him
in
a
moment
she
went
upstairs
to
her
sweet
they
looked
nestling
in
the
little
she
examined
them
with
voluptuous
pleasure
she
threaded
them
in
her
ears
she
looked
at
herself
she
posed
and
postured
and
smiled
and
looked
sad
and
tragic
and
winning
and
appealing
all
in
turn
before
the
mirror
and
she
was
happy
and
very
pretty
she
wore
her
all
morning
in
the
house
she
was
and
quite
brilliantly
winsome
when
the
baker
came
wondering
if
he
would
notice
all
the
tradesmen
left
her
door
with
a
glow
in
them
feeling
elated
and
unconsciously
favouring
the
delightful
little
creature
though
there
had
been
nothing
to
notice
in
her
behaviour
she
was
stimulated
all
the
day
she
did
not
think
about
her
husband
he
was
the
permanent
basis
from
which
she
took
these
giddy
little
flights
into
nowhere
at
night
like
chickens
and
curses
she
would
come
home
to
him
to
roost
meanwhile
whiston
a
traveller
and
confidential
support
of
a
small
firm
hastened
about
his
work
his
heart
all
the
while
anxious
for
her
yearning
for
surety
and
kept
tense
by
not
getting
it
ii
she
had
been
a
warehouse
girl
in
adams
lace
factory
before
she
was
married
sam
adams
was
her
employer
he
was
a
bachelor
of
forty
growing
stout
a
man
well
dressed
and
florid
with
a
large
brown
moustache
and
thin
hair
from
the
rest
of
his
showy
appearance
it
was
evident
his
baldness
was
a
chagrin
to
him
he
had
a
good
presence
and
some
irish
blood
in
his
veins
his
fondness
for
the
girls
or
the
fondness
of
the
girls
for
him
was
notorious
and
elsie
quick
pretty
almost
witty
little
seemed
witty
although
when
her
sayings
were
repeated
they
were
entirely
had
a
great
attraction
for
him
he
would
come
into
the
warehouse
dressed
in
a
rather
sporting
reefer
coat
of
fawn
colour
and
trousers
of
fine
check
a
cap
with
a
big
peak
and
a
scarlet
carnation
in
his
to
impress
her
she
was
only
half
impressed
he
was
too
loud
for
her
good
taste
instinctively
perceiving
this
he
sobered
down
to
navy
blue
then
a
man
florid
with
large
brown
whiskers
smart
navy
blue
suit
fashionable
boots
and
manly
hat
he
was
the
irreproachable
elsie
was
impressed
but
meanwhile
whiston
was
courting
her
and
she
made
splendid
little
gestures
before
her
bedroom
mirror
of
the
sort
true
true
till
that
was
her
song
whiston
was
made
that
way
so
there
was
no
need
to
take
thought
for
him
every
christmas
sam
adams
gave
a
party
at
his
house
to
which
he
invited
his
superior
factory
hands
and
labourers
but
those
above
he
was
a
generous
man
in
his
way
with
a
real
warm
feeling
for
giving
pleasure
two
years
ago
elsie
had
attended
this
for
the
last
time
whiston
had
accompanied
her
at
that
time
he
worked
for
sam
adams
she
had
been
very
proud
of
herself
in
her
dress
of
blue
silk
whiston
called
for
her
then
she
tripped
beside
him
holding
her
large
cashmere
shawl
across
her
breast
he
strode
with
long
strides
his
trousers
handsomely
strapped
under
his
boots
and
her
silk
shoes
bulging
the
pockets
of
his
overcoat
they
passed
through
the
park
gates
and
her
spirits
rose
above
them
the
castle
rock
loomed
grandly
in
the
night
the
naked
trees
stood
still
and
dark
in
the
frost
along
the
boulevard
they
were
rather
late
agitated
with
anticipation
in
the
she
gave
up
her
shawl
donned
her
silk
shoes
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
mirror
the
loose
bunches
of
curls
on
either
side
her
face
danced
prettily
her
mouth
smiled
she
hung
a
moment
in
the
door
of
the
brilliantly
lighted
room
many
people
were
moving
within
the
blaze
of
lamps
under
the
crystal
chandeliers
the
full
skirts
of
the
women
balancing
and
floating
the
and
white
cravats
of
the
men
bowing
above
then
she
entered
the
light
in
an
instant
sam
adams
was
coming
forward
lifting
both
his
arms
in
boisterous
welcome
there
was
a
constant
red
laugh
on
his
face
come
late
would
you
he
shouted
like
he
seized
her
hands
and
led
her
forward
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
when
he
spoke
and
the
effect
of
the
warm
dark
opening
behind
the
brown
whiskers
was
disturbing
but
she
was
floating
into
the
throng
on
his
arm
he
was
very
gallant
now
then
he
said
taking
her
card
to
write
down
the
dances
i
got
carte
blanche
have
i
mr
whiston
does
dance
she
said
i
am
a
lucky
man
he
said
scribbling
his
initials
i
was
born
with
an
amourette
in
my
he
wrote
on
quietly
she
blushed
and
laughed
not
knowing
what
it
meant
why
what
is
that
she
said
it
you
even
littler
than
you
are
dressed
in
little
wings
he
said
i
should
have
to
be
pretty
small
to
get
in
your
mouth
she
said
you
think
you
too
big
do
you
he
said
easily
he
handed
her
her
card
with
a
bow
now
i
set
up
my
darling
for
this
evening
he
said
then
quick
always
at
his
ease
he
looked
over
the
room
she
waited
in
front
of
him
he
was
ready
catching
the
eye
of
the
band
he
nodded
in
a
moment
the
music
began
he
seemed
to
relax
giving
himself
up
now
then
elsie
he
said
with
a
curious
caress
in
his
voice
that
seemed
to
lap
the
outside
of
her
body
in
a
warm
glow
delicious
she
gave
herself
to
it
she
liked
it
he
was
an
excellent
dancer
he
seemed
to
draw
her
close
in
to
him
by
some
male
warmth
of
attraction
so
that
she
became
all
soft
and
pliant
to
him
flowing
to
his
form
whilst
he
united
her
with
him
and
they
lapsed
along
in
one
movement
she
was
just
carried
in
a
kind
of
strong
warm
flood
her
feet
moved
of
themselves
and
only
the
music
threw
her
away
from
him
threw
her
back
to
him
to
his
clasp
in
his
strong
form
moving
against
her
rhythmically
deliriously
when
it
was
over
he
was
pleased
and
his
eyes
had
a
curious
gleam
which
thrilled
her
and
yet
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
yet
it
held
her
he
did
not
speak
to
her
he
only
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
with
a
curious
gleaming
look
that
disturbed
her
fearfully
and
deliriously
but
also
there
was
in
his
look
some
of
the
automatic
irony
of
the
roué
it
left
her
partly
cold
she
was
not
carried
away
she
went
driven
by
an
opposite
heavier
impulse
to
whiston
he
stood
looking
gloomy
trying
to
admit
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
enjoy
herself
apart
from
him
he
received
her
with
rather
grudging
kindliness
are
you
going
to
play
whist
she
asked
aye
he
said
i
do
wish
you
could
well
i
ca
he
said
so
you
enjoy
but
i
should
enjoy
it
better
if
i
could
dance
with
nay
you
all
right
he
said
i
not
made
that
then
you
ought
to
be
she
cried
well
it
my
fault
not
yours
you
enjoy
yourself
he
bade
her
which
she
proceeded
to
do
a
little
bit
irked
she
went
with
anticipation
to
the
arms
of
sam
adams
when
the
time
came
to
dance
with
him
it
was
so
gratifying
irrespective
of
the
man
and
she
felt
a
little
grudge
against
whiston
soon
forgotten
when
her
host
was
holding
her
near
to
him
in
a
delicious
embrace
and
she
watched
his
eyes
to
meet
the
gleam
in
them
which
gratified
her
she
was
getting
warmed
right
through
the
glow
was
penetrating
into
her
driving
away
everything
else
only
in
her
heart
was
a
little
tightness
like
conscience
when
she
got
a
chance
she
escaped
from
the
to
the
there
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
she
found
whiston
playing
cribbage
radiant
roused
animated
she
came
up
to
him
and
greeted
him
she
was
too
strong
too
vibrant
a
note
in
the
quiet
room
he
lifted
his
head
and
a
frown
knitted
his
gloomy
forehead
are
you
playing
cribbage
is
it
exciting
how
are
you
getting
on
she
chattered
he
looked
at
her
none
of
these
questions
needed
answering
and
he
did
not
feel
in
touch
with
her
she
turned
to
the
are
you
white
or
red
she
asked
he
red
replied
the
partner
then
you
losing
she
said
still
to
whiston
and
she
lifted
the
red
peg
from
the
board
up
there
you
ought
to
now
put
it
back
in
its
right
place
said
whiston
where
was
it
she
asked
gaily
knowing
her
transgression
he
took
the
little
red
peg
away
from
her
and
stuck
it
in
its
hole
the
cards
were
shuffled
what
a
shame
you
losing
said
elsie
you
better
cut
for
him
said
the
partner
she
did
so
hastily
the
cards
were
dealt
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
looking
at
his
cards
it
good
she
cried
is
it
he
did
not
answer
but
threw
down
two
cards
it
moved
him
more
strongly
than
was
comfortable
to
have
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
her
curls
dangling
and
touching
his
ears
whilst
she
was
roused
to
another
man
it
made
the
blood
flame
over
him
at
that
moment
sam
adams
appeared
florid
and
boisterous
intoxicated
more
with
himself
with
the
dancing
than
with
wine
in
his
eyes
the
curious
impersonal
light
gleamed
i
thought
i
should
find
you
here
elsie
he
cried
boisterously
a
disturbing
high
note
in
his
voice
what
made
you
think
so
she
replied
the
mischief
rousing
in
her
the
florid
man
narrowed
his
eyes
to
a
smile
i
should
never
look
for
you
among
the
ladies
he
said
with
a
kind
of
intimate
animal
call
to
her
he
laughed
bowed
and
offered
her
his
arm
madam
the
music
she
went
almost
helplessly
carried
along
with
him
unwilling
yet
delighted
that
dance
was
an
intoxication
to
her
after
the
first
few
steps
she
felt
herself
slipping
away
from
herself
she
almost
knew
she
was
going
she
did
not
even
want
to
go
yet
she
must
have
chosen
to
go
she
lay
in
the
arm
of
the
steady
close
man
with
whom
she
was
dancing
and
she
seemed
to
swim
away
out
of
contact
with
the
room
into
him
she
had
passed
into
another
denser
element
of
him
an
essential
privacy
the
room
was
all
vague
around
her
like
an
atmosphere
like
under
sea
with
a
flow
of
ghostly
dumb
movements
but
she
herself
was
held
real
against
her
partner
and
it
seemed
she
was
connected
with
him
as
if
the
movements
of
his
body
and
limbs
were
her
own
movements
yet
not
her
own
oh
delicious
he
also
was
given
up
oblivious
concentrated
into
the
dance
his
eye
was
unseeing
only
his
large
voluptuous
body
gave
off
a
subtle
activity
his
fingers
seemed
to
search
into
her
flesh
every
moment
and
every
moment
she
felt
she
would
give
way
utterly
and
sink
molten
the
fusion
point
was
coming
when
she
would
fuse
down
into
perfect
unconsciousness
at
his
feet
and
knees
but
he
bore
her
round
the
room
in
the
dance
and
he
seemed
to
sustain
all
her
body
with
his
limbs
his
body
and
his
warmth
seemed
to
come
closer
into
her
nearer
till
it
would
fuse
right
through
her
and
she
would
be
as
liquid
to
him
as
an
intoxication
only
it
was
exquisite
when
it
was
over
she
was
dazed
and
was
scarcely
breathing
she
stood
with
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
if
she
were
alone
in
a
remote
place
he
bent
over
her
she
expected
his
lips
on
her
bare
shoulder
and
waited
yet
they
were
not
alone
they
were
not
alone
it
was
cruel
was
good
was
it
my
darling
he
said
to
her
low
and
delighted
there
was
a
strange
impersonality
about
his
low
exultant
call
that
appealed
to
her
irresistibly
yet
why
was
she
aware
of
some
part
shut
off
in
her
she
pressed
his
arm
and
he
led
her
towards
the
door
she
was
not
aware
of
what
she
was
doing
only
a
little
grain
of
resistant
trouble
was
in
her
the
man
possessed
yet
with
a
superficial
presence
of
mind
made
way
to
the
as
if
to
give
her
refreshment
cunningly
working
to
his
own
escape
with
her
he
was
molten
hot
filmed
over
with
presence
of
mind
and
bottomed
with
cold
disbelief
in
the
was
whiston
carrying
coffee
to
the
plain
neglected
ladies
elsie
saw
him
but
felt
as
if
he
could
not
see
her
she
was
beyond
his
reach
and
ken
a
sort
of
fusion
existed
between
her
and
the
large
man
at
her
side
she
ate
her
custard
but
an
incomplete
fusion
all
the
while
sustained
and
contained
her
within
the
being
of
her
employer
but
she
was
growing
cooler
whiston
came
up
she
looked
at
him
and
saw
him
with
different
eyes
she
saw
his
slim
young
man
figure
real
and
enduring
before
her
that
was
he
but
she
was
in
the
spell
with
the
other
man
fused
with
him
and
she
could
not
be
taken
away
have
you
finished
your
cribbage
she
asked
with
hasty
evasion
of
him
yes
he
replied
are
you
getting
tired
of
dancing
not
a
bit
she
said
not
she
said
adams
heartily
no
girl
with
any
spirit
gets
tired
of
something
else
elsie
have
a
glass
of
sherry
with
us
whilst
they
sipped
the
wine
adams
watched
whiston
almost
cunningly
to
find
his
advantage
we
better
be
getting
the
music
he
said
see
the
women
get
something
to
eat
whiston
will
you
there
a
good
and
he
began
to
draw
away
elsie
was
drifting
helplessly
with
him
but
whiston
put
himself
beside
them
and
went
along
with
them
in
silence
they
passed
through
to
the
there
adams
hesitated
and
looked
round
the
room
it
was
as
if
he
could
not
see
a
man
came
hurrying
forward
claiming
elsie
and
adams
went
to
his
other
partner
whiston
stood
watching
during
the
dance
she
was
conscious
of
him
standing
there
observant
of
her
like
a
ghost
or
a
judgment
or
a
guardian
angel
she
was
also
conscious
much
more
intimately
and
impersonally
of
the
body
of
the
other
man
moving
somewhere
in
the
room
she
still
belonged
to
him
but
a
feeling
of
distraction
possessed
her
and
helplessness
adams
danced
on
adhering
to
elsie
waiting
his
time
with
the
persistence
of
cynicism
the
dance
was
over
adams
was
detained
elsie
found
herself
beside
whiston
there
was
something
shapely
about
him
as
he
sat
about
his
knees
and
his
distinct
figure
that
she
clung
to
it
was
as
if
he
had
enduring
form
she
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
are
you
enjoying
yourself
he
asked
ever
so
she
replied
with
a
fervent
yet
detached
tone
it
going
on
for
one
he
said
is
it
she
answered
it
meant
nothing
to
her
should
we
be
going
he
said
she
was
silent
for
the
first
time
for
an
hour
or
more
an
inkling
of
her
normal
consciousness
returned
she
resented
it
what
for
she
said
i
thought
you
might
have
had
enough
he
said
a
slight
soberness
came
over
her
an
irritation
at
being
frustrated
of
her
illusion
why
she
said
we
been
here
since
nine
he
said
that
was
no
answer
no
reason
it
conveyed
nothing
to
her
she
sat
detached
from
him
across
the
room
sam
adams
glanced
at
her
she
sat
there
exposed
for
him
you
do
want
to
be
too
free
with
sam
adams
said
whiston
cautiously
suffering
you
know
what
he
how
free
she
asked
do
want
to
have
too
much
to
do
with
she
sat
silent
he
was
forcing
her
into
consciousness
of
her
position
but
he
could
not
get
hold
of
her
feelings
to
change
them
she
had
a
curious
perverse
desire
that
he
should
not
i
like
him
she
said
what
do
you
find
to
like
in
him
he
said
with
a
hot
heart
i
do
i
like
him
she
said
she
was
immutable
he
sat
feeling
heavy
and
dulled
with
rage
he
was
not
clear
as
to
what
he
felt
he
sat
there
unliving
whilst
she
danced
and
she
distracted
lost
to
herself
between
the
opposing
forces
of
the
two
men
drifted
between
the
dances
whiston
kept
near
to
her
she
was
scarcely
conscious
she
glanced
repeatedly
at
her
card
to
see
when
she
would
dance
again
with
adams
half
in
desire
half
in
dread
sometimes
she
met
his
steady
glaucous
eye
as
she
passed
him
in
the
dance
sometimes
she
saw
the
steadiness
of
his
flank
as
he
danced
and
it
was
always
as
if
she
rested
on
his
arm
were
borne
along
upborne
by
him
away
from
herself
and
always
there
was
present
the
other
antagonism
she
was
divided
the
time
came
for
her
to
dance
with
adams
oh
the
delicious
closing
of
contact
with
him
of
his
limbs
touching
her
limbs
his
arm
supporting
her
she
seemed
to
resolve
whiston
had
not
made
himself
real
to
her
he
was
only
a
heavy
place
in
her
consciousness
but
she
breathed
heavily
beginning
to
suffer
from
the
closeness
of
strain
she
was
nervous
adams
also
was
constrained
a
tightness
a
tension
was
coming
over
them
all
and
he
was
exasperated
feeling
something
counteracting
physical
magnetism
feeling
a
will
stronger
with
her
than
his
own
intervening
in
what
was
becoming
a
vital
necessity
to
him
elsie
was
almost
lost
to
her
own
control
as
she
went
forward
with
him
to
take
her
place
at
the
dance
she
stooped
for
her
the
music
sounded
for
quadrilles
everybody
was
ready
adams
stood
with
his
body
near
her
exerting
his
attraction
over
her
he
was
tense
and
fighting
she
stooped
for
her
and
shook
it
as
she
rose
it
shook
out
and
fell
from
her
hand
with
agony
she
saw
she
had
taken
a
white
stocking
instead
of
a
handkerchief
for
a
second
it
lay
on
the
floor
a
twist
of
white
stocking
then
in
an
instant
adams
picked
it
up
with
a
little
surprised
laugh
of
triumph
that
do
for
me
he
to
take
possession
of
her
and
he
stuffed
the
stocking
in
his
trousers
pocket
and
quickly
offered
her
his
handkerchief
the
dance
began
she
felt
weak
and
faint
as
if
her
will
were
turned
to
water
a
heavy
sense
of
loss
came
over
her
she
could
not
help
herself
anymore
but
it
was
peace
when
the
dance
was
over
adams
yielded
her
up
whiston
came
to
her
what
was
it
as
you
dropped
whiston
asked
i
thought
it
was
my
taken
a
stocking
by
mistake
she
said
detached
and
muted
and
he
got
it
what
does
he
mean
by
that
she
lifted
her
shoulders
are
you
going
to
let
him
keep
it
he
asked
i
do
let
there
was
a
long
pause
am
i
to
go
and
have
it
out
with
him
he
asked
his
face
flushed
his
blue
eyes
going
hard
with
opposition
no
she
said
pale
why
do
want
to
say
anything
about
he
sat
exasperated
and
nonplussed
you
let
him
keep
it
then
he
asked
she
sat
silent
and
made
no
form
of
answer
what
do
you
mean
by
it
he
said
dark
with
fury
and
he
started
up
no
she
cried
ted
and
she
caught
hold
of
him
sharply
detaining
him
it
made
him
black
with
rage
why
he
said
then
something
about
her
mouth
was
pitiful
to
him
he
did
not
understand
but
he
felt
she
must
have
her
reasons
then
i
not
stopping
here
he
said
are
you
coming
with
me
she
rose
mutely
and
they
went
out
of
the
room
adams
had
not
noticed
in
a
few
moments
they
were
in
the
street
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
he
said
in
a
black
fury
she
went
at
his
side
in
silence
neutral
that
great
hog
an
all
he
added
then
they
went
a
long
time
in
silence
through
the
frozen
deserted
darkness
of
the
town
she
felt
she
could
not
go
indoors
they
were
drawing
near
her
house
i
do
want
to
go
home
she
suddenly
cried
in
distress
and
anguish
i
do
want
to
go
he
looked
at
her
why
do
you
he
said
i
do
want
to
go
home
was
all
she
could
sob
he
heard
somebody
coming
well
we
can
walk
a
bit
further
he
said
she
was
silent
again
they
passed
out
of
the
town
into
the
fields
he
held
her
by
the
could
not
speak
what
he
asked
at
length
puzzled
she
began
to
cry
again
at
last
he
took
her
in
his
arms
to
soothe
her
she
sobbed
by
herself
almost
unaware
of
him
tell
me
what
elsie
he
said
tell
me
what
me
he
kissed
her
wet
face
and
caressed
her
she
made
no
response
he
was
puzzled
and
tender
and
miserable
at
length
she
became
quiet
then
he
kissed
her
and
she
put
her
arms
round
him
and
clung
to
him
very
tight
as
if
for
fear
and
anguish
he
held
her
in
his
arms
wondering
ted
she
whispered
frantic
ted
what
my
love
he
answered
becoming
also
afraid
be
good
to
me
she
cried
do
be
cruel
to
no
my
pet
he
said
amazed
and
grieved
why
oh
be
good
to
me
she
sobbed
and
he
held
her
very
safe
and
his
heart
was
with
love
for
her
his
mind
was
amazed
he
could
only
hold
her
against
his
chest
that
was
with
love
and
belief
in
her
so
she
was
restored
at
last
iii
she
refused
to
go
to
her
work
at
adams
any
more
her
father
had
to
submit
and
she
sent
in
her
was
not
well
sam
adams
was
ironical
but
he
had
a
curious
patience
he
did
not
fight
in
a
few
weeks
she
and
whiston
were
married
she
loved
him
with
passion
and
worship
a
fierce
little
abandon
of
love
that
moved
him
to
the
depths
of
his
being
and
gave
him
a
permanent
surety
and
sense
of
realness
in
himself
he
did
not
trouble
about
himself
any
more
he
felt
he
was
fulfilled
and
now
he
had
only
the
many
things
in
the
world
to
busy
himself
about
whatever
troubled
him
at
the
bottom
was
surety
he
had
found
himself
in
this
love
they
spoke
once
or
twice
of
the
white
stocking
ah
whiston
exclaimed
what
does
it
matter
he
was
impatient
and
angry
and
could
not
bear
to
consider
the
matter
so
it
was
left
unresolved
she
was
quite
happy
at
first
carried
away
by
her
adoration
of
her
husband
then
gradually
she
got
used
to
him
he
always
was
the
ground
of
her
happiness
but
she
got
used
to
him
as
to
the
air
she
breathed
he
never
got
used
to
her
in
the
same
way
inside
of
marriage
she
found
her
liberty
she
was
rid
of
the
responsibility
of
herself
her
husband
must
look
after
that
she
was
free
to
get
what
she
could
out
of
her
time
so
that
when
after
some
months
she
met
sam
adams
she
was
not
quite
as
unkind
to
him
as
she
might
have
been
with
a
young
wife
new
and
exciting
knowledge
of
men
she
perceived
he
was
in
love
with
her
she
knew
he
had
always
kept
an
unsatisfied
desire
for
her
and
sportive
she
could
not
help
playing
a
little
with
this
though
she
cared
not
one
jot
for
the
man
himself
when
valentine
day
came
which
was
near
the
first
anniversary
of
her
wedding
day
there
arrived
a
white
stocking
with
a
little
amethyst
brooch
luckily
whiston
did
not
see
it
so
she
said
nothing
of
it
to
him
she
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
having
anything
to
do
with
sam
adams
but
once
a
little
brooch
was
in
her
possession
it
was
hers
and
she
did
not
trouble
her
head
for
a
moment
how
she
had
come
by
it
she
kept
it
now
she
had
the
pearl
they
were
a
more
valuable
and
a
more
conspicuous
present
she
would
have
to
ask
her
mother
to
give
them
to
her
to
explain
their
presence
she
made
a
little
plan
in
her
head
and
she
was
extraordinarily
pleased
as
for
sam
adams
even
if
he
saw
her
wearing
them
he
would
not
give
her
away
what
fun
if
he
saw
her
wearing
his
she
would
pretend
she
had
inherited
them
from
her
grandmother
her
mother
mother
she
laughed
to
herself
as
she
went
down
town
in
the
afternoon
the
pretty
drops
dangling
in
front
of
her
curls
but
she
saw
no
one
of
importance
whiston
came
home
tired
and
depressed
all
day
the
male
in
him
had
been
uneasy
and
this
had
fatigued
him
she
was
curiously
against
him
inclined
as
she
sometimes
was
nowadays
to
make
mock
of
him
and
jeer
at
him
and
cut
him
off
he
did
not
understand
this
and
it
angered
him
deeply
she
was
uneasy
before
him
she
knew
he
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
irritation
the
veins
stood
out
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
his
brow
was
drawn
stiffly
yet
she
could
not
help
goading
him
what
did
you
do
wi
that
white

he
asked

of
a
gloomy
silence
his
voice
strong
and
brutal
i
put

in

replied
flippantly
why
did
you
put
it
on
the
fire
back
he
said
harshly
what

it
up
for
i
not

up
she
said

he
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
she
unable
to
move
him
ran
away
upstairs
leaving
him
smoking
by
the
fire
again
she
tried
on
the
then
another
little
inspiration
came
to
her
she
drew
on
the
white
stockings
both
of
them
presently
she
came
down
in
them
her
husband
still
sat
immovable
and
glowering
by
the
fire
look
she
said
they
do
and
she
picked
up
her
skirts
to
her
knees
and
twisted
round
looking
at
her
pretty
legs
in
the
neat
stockings
he
filled
with
unreasonable
rage
and
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
do
they
look
nice
she
said
one
from
last
year
and
one
from
this
they
just
do
save
you
buying
a
and
she
looked
over
her
shoulders
at
her
pretty
calves
and
the
dangling
frills
of
her
knickers
put
your
skirts
down
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
he
said
why
a
fool
of
myself
she
asked
and
she
began
to
dance
slowly
round
the
room
kicking
up
her
feet
half
reckless
half
jeering
in
a
fashion
almost
fearfully
yet
in
defiance
she
kicked
up
her
legs
at
him
singing
as
she
did
so
she
resented
him
you
little
fool
ha
done
with
it
he
said
and
you
backfire
them
stockings
i
telling
he
was
angry
his
face
flushed
dark
he
kept
his
head
bent
she
ceased
to
dance
i
sha
she
said
they
come
in
very
he
lifted
his
head
and
watched
her
with
lighted
dangerous
eyes
you
put
on
the
fire
back
i
tell
you
he
said
it
was
a
war
now
she
bent
forward
in
a
fashion
and
put
her
tongue
between
her
teeth
i
sha
backfire
them
stockings
she
sang
repeating
his
words
i
sha
i
sha
i
and
she
danced
round
the
room
doing
a
high
kick
to
the
tune
of
her
words
there
was
a
real
biting
indifference
in
her
behaviour
we
see
whether
you
will
or
not
he
said
trollops
you
like
sam
adams
to
know
you
was
wearing
would

that
what
would
please
yes
i
like
him
to
see
how
nicely
they
fit
me
he
might
give
me
some
more
and
she
looked
down
at
her
pretty
legs
he
knew
somehow
that
she
would
like
sam
adams
to
see
how
pretty
her
legs
looked
in
the
white
stockings
it
made
his
anger
go
deep
almost
to
hatred
yer
nasty
trolley
he
cried
put
yer
petticoats
down
and
stop
being
so
i
not
she
said
my
legs
are
my
own
and
why
sam
adams
think
they
nice
there
was
a
pause
he
watched
her
with
eyes
glittering
to
a
point
have
you
been
havin
owt
to
do
with
him
he
asked
i
just
spoken
to
him
when
i
seen
him
she
said
he
not
as
bad
as
you
would
make
is
he
he
cried
a
certain
wakefulness
in
his
voice
them
who
has
anything
to
do
wi
him
is
too
bad
for
me
i
tell
why
what
are
you
frightened
of
him
for
she
mocked
she
was
rousing
all
his
uncontrollable
anger
he
sat
glowering
every
one
of
her
sentences
stirred
him
up
like
a
iron
soon
it
would
be
too
much
and
she
was
afraid
herself
but
she
was
neither
conquered
nor
convinced
a
curious
little
grin
of
hate
came
on
his
face
he
had
a
long
score
against
her
what
am
i
frightened
of
him
for
he
repeated
automatically
what
am
i
frightened
of
him
for
why
for
you
you
little
she
flushed
the
insult
went
deep
into
her
right
home
well
if
you
so
she
said
lowering
her
eyelids
and
speaking
coldly
haughtily
if
i
so
dull
i
break
your
neck
the
first
word
you
speak
to
him
he
said
tense
pf
she
sneered
do
you
think
i
frightened
of
you
she
spoke
coldly
detached
she
was
frightened
for
all
that
white
round
the
mouth
his
heart
was
getting
hotter
you
will
be
frightened
of
me
the
next
time
you
have
anything
to
do
with
him
he
said
do
you
think
you
ever
be
her
jeering
scorn
made
him
go
molten
he
knew
he
was
incoherent
scarcely
responsible
for
what
he
might
do
slowly
unseeing
he
rose
and
went
out
of
doors
stifled
moved
to
kill
her
he
stood
leaning
against
the
garden
fence
unable
either
to
see
or
hear
below
him
far
off
fumed
the
lights
of
the
town
he
stood
still
unconscious
with
a
black
storm
of
rage
his
face
lifted
to
the
night
presently
still
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
he
went
indoors
again
she
stood
a
small
stubborn
figure
with
lips
and
big
sullen
childish
eyes
watching
him
white
with
fear
he
went
heavily
across
the
floor
and
dropped
into
his
chair
there
was
a
silence
you
not
going
to
tell
me
everything
i
shall
do
and
everything
i
sha
she
broke
out
at
last
he
lifted
his
head
i
tell
you
this
he
said
low
and
intense
have
anything
to
do
with
sam
adams
and
i
break
your
she
laughed
shrill
and
false
how
i
hate
your
word
your
neck
she
said
with
a
grimace
of
the
mouth
it
sounds
so
common
and
beastly
ca
you
say
something
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
besides
she
said
with
a
queer
chirrup
of
mocking
laughter
what
do
you
know
about
anything
he
sent
me
an
amethyst
brooch
and
a
pair
of
pearl
he
what
said
whiston
in
a
suddenly
normal
voice
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
sent
me
a
pair
of
pearl
and
an
amethyst
brooch
she
repeated
mechanically
pale
to
the
lips
and
her
big
black
childish
eyes
watched
him
fascinated
held
in
her
spell
he
seemed
to
thrust
his
face
and
his
eyes
forward
at
her
as
he
rose
slowly
and
came
to
her
she
watched
transfixed
in
terror
her
throat
made
a
small
sound
as
she
tried
to
scream
then
quick
as
lightning
the
back
of
his
hand
struck
her
with
a
crash
across
the
mouth
and
she
was
flung
back
blinded
against
the
wall
the
shock
shook
a
queer
sound
out
of
her
and
then
she
saw
him
still
coming
on
his
eyes
holding
her
his
fist
drawn
back
advancing
slowly
at
any
instant
the
blow
might
crash
into
her
mad
with
terror
she
raised
her
hands
with
a
queer
clawing
movement
to
cover
her
eyes
and
her
temples
opening
her
mouth
in
a
dumb
shriek
there
was
no
sound
but
the
sight
of
her
slowly
arrested
him
he
hung
before
her
looking
at
her
fixedly
as
she
stood
crouched
against
the
wall
with
open
bleeding
mouth
and
eyes
and
two
hands
clawing
over
her
temples
and
his
lust
to
see
her
bleed
to
break
her
and
destroy
her
rose
from
an
old
source
against
her
it
carried
him
he
wanted
satisfaction
but
he
had
seen
her
standing
there
a
piteous
horrified
thing
and
he
turned
his
face
aside
in
shame
and
nausea
he
went
and
sat
heavily
in
his
chair
and
a
curious
ease
almost
like
sleep
came
over
his
brain
she
walked
away
from
the
wall
towards
the
fire
dizzy
white
to
the
lips
mechanically
wiping
her
small
bleeding
mouth
he
sat
motionless
then
gradually
her
breath
began
to
hiss
she
shook
and
was
sobbing
silently
in
grief
for
herself
without
looking
he
saw
it
made
his
mad
desire
to
destroy
her
come
back
at
length
he
lifted
his
head
his
eyes
were
glowing
again
fixed
on
her
and
what
did
he
give
them
you
for
he
asked
in
a
steady
unyielding
voice
her
crying
dried
up
in
a
second
she
also
was
tense
they
came
as
valentines
she
replied
still
not
subjugated
even
if
beaten
when
today
the
pearl
amethyst
brooch
last
you
had
it
a
year
she
felt
that
now
nothing
would
prevent
him
if
he
rose
to
kill
her
she
could
not
prevent
him
any
more
she
was
yielded
up
to
him
they
both
trembled
in
the
balance
unconscious
what
have
you
had
to
do
with
him
he
asked
in
a
barren
voice
i
not
had
anything
to
do
with
him
she
quavered
you
just
kept
because
they
were
jewellery
he
said
a
weariness
came
over
him
what
was
the
worth
of
speaking
any
more
of
it
he
did
not
care
any
more
he
was
dreary
and
sick
she
began
to
cry
again
but
he
took
no
notice
she
kept
wiping
her
mouth
on
her
handkerchief
he
could
see
it
the
it
made
him
only
more
sick
and
tired
of
the
responsibility
of
it
the
violence
the
shame
when
she
began
to
move
about
again
he
raised
his
head
once
more
from
his
dead
motionless
position
where
are
the
things
he
said
they
are
upstairs
she
quavered
she
knew
the
passion
had
gone
down
in
him
bring
them
down
he
said
i
wo
she
wept
with
rage
you
not
going
to
bully
me
and
hit
me
like
that
on
the
and
she
sobbed
again
he
looked
at
her
in
contempt
and
compassion
and
in
rising
anger
where
are
they
he
said
they
in
the
little
drawer
under
the
she
sobbed
he
went
slowly
upstairs
struck
a
match
and
found
the
trinkets
he
brought
them
downstairs
in
his
hand
these
he
said
looking
at
them
as
they
lay
in
his
palm
she
looked
at
them
without
answering
she
was
not
interested
in
them
any
more
he
looked
at
the
little
jewels
they
were
pretty
it
none
of
their
fault
he
said
to
himself
and
he
searched
round
slowly
persistently
for
a
box
he
tied
the
things
up
and
addressed
them
to
sam
adams
then
he
went
out
in
his
slippers
to
post
the
little
package
when
he
came
back
she
was
still
sitting
crying
you
better
go
to
bed
he
said
she
paid
no
attention
he
sat
by
the
fire
she
still
cried
i
sleeping
down
here
he
said
go
you
to
in
a
few
moments
she
lifted
her
swollen
face
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
all
forlorn
and
pathetic
a
great
flash
of
anguish
went
over
his
body
he
went
over
slowly
and
very
gently
took
her
in
his
hands
she
let
herself
be
taken
then
as
she
lay
against
his
shoulder
she
sobbed
aloud
i
never
my
little
he
cried
in
anguish
of
spirit
holding
her
in
his
arms
a
sick
collier
she
was
too
good
for
him
everybody
said
yet
still
she
did
not
regret
marrying
him
he
had
come
courting
her
when
he
was
only
nineteen
and
she
twenty
he
was
in
build
what
they
call
a
tight
little
fellow
short
dark
with
a
warm
colour
and
that
upright
set
of
the
head
and
chest
that
flaunting
way
in
movement
recalling
a
mating
bird
which
denotes
a
body
taut
and
compact
with
life
being
a
good
worker
he
had
earned
decent
money
in
the
mine
and
having
a
good
home
had
saved
a
little
she
was
a
cook
at
uplands
a
tall
fair
girl
very
quiet
having
seen
her
walk
down
the
street
horsepool
had
followed
her
from
a
distance
he
was
taken
with
her
he
did
not
drink
and
he
was
not
lazy
so
although
he
seemed
a
bit
simple
without
much
intelligence
but
having
a
sort
of
physical
brightness
she
considered
and
accepted
him
when
they
were
married
they
went
to
live
in
scargill
street
in
a
highly
respectable
house
which
they
had
furnished
between
them
the
street
was
built
up
the
side
of
a
long
steep
hill
it
was
narrow
and
rather
nevertheless
the
back
looked
out
over
the
adjoining
pasture
across
a
wide
valley
of
fields
and
woods
in
the
bottom
of
which
the
mine
lay
snugly
he
made
himself
gaffer
in
his
own
house
she
was
unacquainted
with
a
collier
mode
of
life
they
were
married
on
a
saturday
on
the
sunday
night
he
said

she
demurred

white
cloths

he
said
he
put
before
the
fire
his
moleskin
trousers
a
clean
singlet
or
sleeveless
vest
of
thick
flannel
a
pair
of
stockings
and
his
pit
boots
arranging
them
all
to
be
warm
and
ready
for
morning
now
tha
sees
that
wants
doin
ivery
punctually
at
half
past
five
he
left
her
without
any
form
of
going
downstairs
in
his
shirt
when
he
arrived
home
at
four
in
the
afternoon
his
dinner
was
ready
to
be
dished
up
she
was
startled
when
he
came
in
a
short
sturdy
figure
with
a
face
indescribably
black
and
streaked
she
stood
before
the
fire
in
her
white
blouse
and
white
apron
a
fair
girl
the
picture
of
beautiful
cleanliness
he
clommaxed
in
in
his
heavy
boots
well
how
ter
gone
on
he
asked
i
was
ready
for
you
to
come
home
she
replied
tenderly
in
his
black
face
the
whites
of
his
brown
eyes
flashed
at
her
an
i
wor
ready
for
comin
he
said
he
planked
his
tin
bottle
and
on
the
dresser
took
off
his
coat
and
scarf
and
waistcoat
dragged
his
armchair
nearer
the
fire
and
sat
down
let
a
bit
o
dinner
about
clammed
he
said
are
you
goin
to
wash
yourself
first
what
am
i
to

mysen
for
well

ca
eat
your
oh
strike
a
daisy
missis
dunna
i
eat
my
snap
i
th
pit
weshin
she
served
the
dinner
and
sat
opposite
him
his
small
bullet
head
was
quite
black
save
for
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
his
scarlet
lips
it
gave
her
a
queer
sensation
to
see
him
open
his
red
mouth
and
bare
his
white
teeth
as
he
ate
his
arms
and
hands
were
mottled
black
his
bare
strong
neck
got
a
little
fairer
as
it
settled
towards
his
shoulders
reassuring
her
there
was
the
faint
indescribable
odour
of
the
pit
in
the
room
an
odour
of
damp
exhausted
air
why
is
your
vest
so
black
on
the
shoulders
she
asked
my
singlet
that
wi
th
watter
droppin
on
us
from
th
roof
this
is
a
dry
un
as
i
put

afore
i
come
up
they
an
as
we
change
us
things
we
put
on
theer
ter
when
he
washed
himself
kneeling
on
the
stripped
to
the
waist
she
felt
afraid
of
him
again
he
was
so
muscular
he
seemed
so
intent
on
what
he
was
doing
so
intensely
himself
like
a
vigorous
animal
and
as
he
stood
wiping
himself
with
his
naked
breast
towards
her
she
felt
rather
sick
seeing
his
thick
arms
bulge
their
muscles
they
were
nevertheless
very
happy
he
was
at
a
great
pitch
of
pride
because
of
her
the
men
in
the
pit
might
chaff
him
they
might
try
to
entice
him
away
but
nothing
could
reduce
his
pride
because
of
her
nothing
could
unsettle
his
almost
infantile
satisfaction
in
the
evening
he
sat
in
his
armchair
chattering
to
her
or
listening
as
she
read
the
newspaper
to
him
when
it
was
fine
he
would
go
into
the
street
squat
on
his
heels
as
colliers
do
with
his
back
against
the
wall
of
his
parlour
and
call
to
the
in
greeting
one
after
another
if
no
one
were
passing
he
was
content
just
to
squat
and
smoke
having
such
a
fund
of
sufficiency
and
satisfaction
in
his
heart
he
was
well
married
they
had
not
been
wed
a
year
when
all
brent
and
wellwood
men
came
out
on
strike
willy
was
in
the
union
so
with
a
pinch
they
scrambled
through
the
furniture
was
not
all
paid
for
and
other
debts
were
incurred
she
worried
and
contrived
he
left
it
to
her
but
he
was
a
good
husband
he
gave
her
all
he
had
the
men
were

of

a
lad
warned

or
hesitating
she
prepared
but
when
the
ambulance
came
and
she
heard

with
pain
at
being
moved
she
was
afraid
lest
she
should

he
cried
again
he
had
never
been
ill
in
his
life
when
he
had
smashed
a
finger
he
could
look
at
the
wound
but
this
pain
came
from
inside
and
terrified
him
at
last
he
was
soothed
and
exhausted
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
undress
him
and
wash
him
he
would
let
no
other
woman
do
for
him
having
that
savage
modesty
usual
in
such
men
for
six
weeks
he
was
in
bed
suffering
much
pain
the
doctors
were
not
quite
sure
what
was
the
matter
with
him
and
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
he
could
eat
he
did
not
lose
flesh
nor
strength
yet
the
pain
continued
and
he
could
hardly
walk
at
all
in
the
sixth
week
the
men
came
out
in
the
national
strike
he
would
get
up
quite
early
in
the
morning
and
sit
by
the
window
on
wednesday
the
second
week
of
the
strike
he
sat
gazing
out
on
the
street
as
usual
a
young
man
still
but
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
hunted
fear
in
his
face
lucy
he
called
lucy
she
pale
and
worn
ran
upstairs
at
his
bidding
me
a
he
said

she
continued

he
said
with
a
little
horror
in
his
voice

replied
the
doctor
says

downhill
she
said
that

i
just
go
an
finish
your
she
left
him
the
went
by
shaking
the
houses
then
the
street
was
quiet
save
for
the
men
a
gang
of
youths
from
fifteen
to
years
old
were
playing
marbles
in
the
middle
of
the
road
other
little
groups
of
men
were
playing
on

that

hardly

men

up
the
street

struggled
with

to
prevent
his
going
to
the
stairs
when
she
escaped
from
him
he
was
shouting
and
raving
she
beckoned
to
her
neighbour
a
girl
of
who
was
cleaning
the
window
across
the
road
ethel
mellor

the
daughter
of

he
was
subsiding
when
he
sat
down
his
wife
collapsed
in
a
chair
weeping
noiselessly
the
tears
ran
down
ethel
face
he
sat
staring
out
of
the
window
then
the
old
hurt
look
came
on
his
face
what
i
been

he
asked
looking
piteously
at
his
wife

he
faltered
you

what
you

said
his
young
wife
gently
but
coldly
his
face
puckered
up
he
bit
his
lip
then
broke
into
tears
sobbing
uncontrollably
with
his
face
to
the
window
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
of
three
people
crying
bitterly
breath
caught
in
sobs
suddenly
lucy
put
away
her
tears
and
went
over
to
him
you
did
know

you

street
she
said
ethel

into
the
parlour
and

but
if

whatever
shall
we
do
the
christening
the
mistress
of
the
british
school
stepped
down
from
her
school
gate
and
instead
of
turning
to
the
left
as
usual
she
turned
to
the
right
two
women
who
were
hastening
home
to
scramble
their
husbands
dinners
was
five
minutes
to
to
look
at
her
they
stood
gazing
after
her
for
a
moment
then
they
glanced
at
each
other
with
a
woman
little
grimace
to
be
sure
the
retreating
figure
was
ridiculous
small
and
thin
with
a
black
straw
hat
and
a
rusty
cashmere
dress
hanging
full
all
round
the
skirt
for
so
small
and
frail
and
rusty
a
creature
to
sail
with
slow
deliberate
stride
was
also
absurd
hilda
rowbotham
was
less
than
thirty
so
it
was
not
years
that
set
the
measure
of
her
pace
she
had
heart
disease
keeping
her
face
that
was
small
with
sickness
but
not
uncomely
firmly
lifted
and
fronting
ahead
the
young
woman
sailed
on
past
the
like
a
black
swan
of
mournful
disreputable
plumage
she
turned
into
berryman
the
baker
the
shop
displayed
bread
and
cakes
sacks
of
flour
and
oatmeal
flitches
of
bacon
hams
lard
and
sausages
the
combination
of
scents
was
not
unpleasing
hilda
rowbotham
stood
for
some
minutes
nervously
tapping
and
pushing
a
large
knife
that
lay
on
the
counter
and
looking
at
the
tall
glittering
brass
scales
at
last
a
morose
man
with
sandy
whiskers
came
down
the
step
from
the
what
is
it
he
asked
not
apologizing
for
his
delay
will
you
give
me
of
assorted
cakes
and
put
in
some
macaroons
please
she
asked
in
remarkably
rapid
and
nervous
speech
her
lips
fluttered
like
two
leaves
in
a
wind
and
her
words
crowded
and
rushed
like
a
flock
of
sheep
at
a
gate
we
got
no
macaroons
said
the
man
churlishly
he
had
evidently
caught
that
word
he
stood
waiting
then
i
ca
have
any
mr
berryman
now
i
do
feel
disappointed
i
like
those
macaroons
you
know
and
it
not
often
i
treat
myself
one
gets
so
tired
of
trying
to
spoil
oneself
do
you
think
it
less
profitable
even
than
trying
to
spoil
somebody
she
laughed
a
quick
little
nervous
laugh
putting
her
hand
to
her
face
then
what
you
have
asked
the
man
without
the
ghost
of
an
answering
smile
he
evidently
had
not
followed
so
he
looked
more
glum
than
ever
oh
anything
you
got
replied
the
schoolmistress
flushing
slightly
the
man
moved
slowly
about
dropping
the
cakes
from
various
dishes
one
by
one
into
a
paper
bag
how
that
sister
o
yours
getting
on
he
asked
as
if
he
were
talking
to
the
flour
scoop
whom
do
you
mean
snapped
the
schoolmistress
the
youngest
answered
the
stooping
man
with
a
note
of
sarcasm
emma
oh
she
very
well
thank
you
the
schoolmistress
was
very
red
but
she
spoke
with
sharp
ironical
defiance
the
man
grunted
then
he
handed
her
the
bag
and
watched
her
out
of
the
shop
without
bidding
her
good
afternoon
she
had
the
whole
length
of
the
main
street
to
traverse
a
of
torture
with
shame
flushing
over
her
neck
but
she
carried
her
white
bag
with
an
appearance
of
steadfast
unconcern
when
she
turned
into
the
field
she
seemed
to
droop
a
little
the
wide
valley
opened
out
from
her
with
the
far
woods
withdrawing
into
twilight
and
away
in
the
centre
the
great
pit
streaming
its
white
smoke
and
chuffing
as
the
men
were
being
turned
up
a
full
moon
like
a
flamingo
flying
low
under
the
far
dusky
east
drew
out
of
the
mist
it
was
beautiful
and
it
made
her
irritable
sadness
soften
diffuse
across
the
field
and
she
was
at
home
it
was
a
new
substantial
cottage
built
with
unstinted
hand
such
a
house
as
an
old
miner
could
build
himself
out
of
his
savings
in
the
rather
small
kitchen
a
woman
of
dark
saturnine
complexion
sat
nursing
a
baby
in
a
long
white
gown
a
young
woman
of
heavy
brutal
cast
stood
at
the
table
cutting
bread
and
butter
she
had
a
downcast
humble
mien
that
sat
unnaturally
on
her
and
was
strangely
irritating
she
did
not
look
round
when
her
sister
entered
hilda
put
down
the
bag
of
cakes
and
left
the
room
not
having
spoken
to
emma
nor
to
the
baby
not
to
mrs
carlin
who
had
come
in
to
help
for
the
afternoon
almost
immediately
the
father
entered
from
the
yard
with
a
dustpan
full
of
coals
he
was
a
large
man
but
he
was
going
to
pieces
as
he
passed
through
he
gripped
the
door
with
his
free
hand
to
steady
himself
but
turning
he
lurched
and
swayed
he
began
putting
the
coals
on
the
fire
piece
by
piece
one
lump
fell
from
his
hand
and
smashed
on
the
white
hearth
emma
rowbotham
looked
round
and
began
in
a
rough
loud
voice
of
anger
look
at
you
then
she
consciously
moderated
her
tones
sweep
it
up
in
a
you
bother
you
only
be
going
head
first
into
the
her
father
bent
down
nevertheless
to
clear
up
the
mess
he
had
made
saying
articulating
his
words
loosely
and
slavering
in
his
speech
the
lousy
bit
of
a
thing
it
slipped
between
my
fingers
like
a
as
he
spoke
he
went
tilting
towards
the
fire
the
woman
cried
out
he
put
his
hand
on
the
hot
stove
to
save
himself
emma
swung
round
and
dragged
him
off
did
i
tell
you
she
cried
roughly
now
have
you
burnt
yourself
she
held
tight
hold
of
the
big
man
and
pushed
him
into
his
chair
what
the
matter
cried
a
sharp
voice
from
the
other
room
the
speaker
appeared
a
hard
woman
of
emma
do
speak
like
that
to
then
in
a
tone
not
so
cold
but
just
as
sharp
now
father
what
have
you
been
doing
emma
withdrew
to
her
table
sullenly
it
nöwt
said
the
old
man
vainly
protesting
it
nöwt
at
a
get
on
wi
what
you
i
afraid
burnt
said
the
woman
speaking
of
him
with
a
kind
of
hard
pity
as
if
he
were
a
cumbersome
child
bertha
took
the
old
man
hand
and
looked
at
it
making
a
quick
noise
of
impatience
emma
get
that
zinc
some
white
rag
she
commanded
sharply
the
younger
sister
put
down
her
loaf
with
the
knife
in
it
and
went
to
a
sensitive
observer
this
obedience
was
more
intolerable
than
the
most
hateful
discord
the
dark
woman
bent
over
the
baby
and
made
silent
gentle
movements
of
motherliness
to
it
the
little
one
smiled
and
moved
on
her
lap
it
continued
to
move
and
twist
i
believe
this
child
hungry
she
said
how
long
is
it
since
he
had
anything
just
afore
dinner
said
emma
dully
good
gracious
exclaimed
bertha
you
need
starve
the
child
now
you
got
it
once
every
two
hours
it
ought
to
be
fed
as
i
told
you
and
now
it
three
take
him
poor
little
cut
the
she
bent
and
looked
at
the
bonny
baby
she
could
not
help
herself
she
smiled
and
pressed
its
cheek
with
her
finger
and
nodded
to
it
making
little
noises
then
she
turned
and
took
the
loaf
from
her
sister
the
woman
rose
and
gave
the
child
to
its
mother
emma
bent
over
the
little
sucking
mite
she
hated
it
when
she
looked
at
it
and
saw
it
as
a
symbol
but
when
she
felt
it
her
love
was
like
fire
in
her
blood
i
should
think
canna
be
comin
said
the
father
uneasily
looking
up
at
the
clock
nonsense
clock
fast
it
but
four
fidget
bertha
continued
to
cut
the
bread
and
butter
open
a
tin
of
pears
she
said
to
the
woman
in
a
much
milder
tone
then
she
went
into
the
next
room
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
the
old
man
said
again
i
should
thought
he
been
by
now
if
he
means
emma
engrossed
did
not
answer
the
father
had
ceased
to
consider
her
since
she
had
become
humbled
come
assured
the
stranger
a
few
minutes
later
bertha
hurried
into
the
kitchen
taking
off
her
apron
the
dog
barked
furiously
she
opened
the
door
commanded
the
dog
to
silence
and
said
he
will
be
quiet
now
mr
thank
you
said
a
sonorous
voice
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
bicycle
being
propped
against
a
wall
a
clergyman
entered
a
thin
ugly
man
of
nervous
manner
he
went
straight
to
the
father
are
you
he
asked
musically
peering
down
on
the
great
frame
of
the
miner
ruined
by
locomotor
ataxy
his
voice
was
full
of
gentleness
but
he
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
see
distinctly
could
not
get
things
clear
have
you
hurt
you
hand
he
said
comfortingly
seeing
the
white
rag
it
wor
nöwt
but
a
pestered
bit
o
coal
as
dropped
an
i
put
my
hand
on
th
hub
i
thought
tha
worna
the
familiar
and
the
reproach
were
unconscious
retaliation
on
the
old
man
part
the
minister
smiled
half
wistfully
half
indulgently
he
was
full
of
vague
tenderness
then
he
turned
to
the
young
mother
who
flushed
sullenly
because
her
dishonoured
breast
was
uncovered
how
are
you
he
asked
very
softly
and
gently
as
if
she
were
ill
and
he
were
mindful
of
her
i
all
right
she
replied
awkwardly
taking
his
hand
without
rising
hiding
her
face
and
the
anger
that
rose
in
her
peered
down
at
the
baby
which
sucked
with
distended
mouth
upon
the
firm
breast
yes
he
seemed
lost
in
a
dim
musing
coming
to
he
shook
hands
unseeingly
with
the
woman
presently
they
all
went
into
the
next
room
the
minister
hesitating
to
help
his
crippled
old
deacon
i
can
go
by
myself
thank
yer
testily
replied
the
father
soon
all
were
seated
everybody
was
separated
in
feeling
and
isolated
at
table
high
tea
was
spread
in
the
middle
kitchen
a
large
ugly
room
kept
for
special
occasions
hilda
appeared
last
and
the
clumsy
clergyman
rose
to
meet
her
he
was
afraid
of
this
family
the
old
collier
and
the
brutal
children
but
hilda
was
queen
among
them
she
was
the
clever
one
and
had
been
to
college
she
felt
responsible
for
the
keeping
up
of
a
high
standard
of
conduct
in
all
the
members
of
the
family
there
was
a
difference
between
the
rowbothams
and
the
common
collier
folk
woodbine
cottage
was
a
superior
house
to
was
built
in
pride
by
the
old
man
she
hilda
was
a
schoolmistress
she
meant
to
keep
up
the
prestige
of
her
house
in
spite
of
blows
she
had
put
on
a
dress
of
green
voile
for
this
special
occasion
but
she
was
very
thin
her
neck
protruded
painfully
the
clergyman
however
greeted
her
almost
with
reverence
and
with
some
assumption
of
dignity
she
sat
down
before
the
tray
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
sat
the
broken
massive
frame
of
her
father
next
to
him
was
the
youngest
daughter
nursing
the
restless
baby
the
minister
sat
between
hilda
and
bertha
hulking
his
bony
frame
uncomfortably
there
was
a
great
spread
on
the
table
of
tinned
fruits
and
tinned
salmon
ham
and
cakes
miss
rowbotham
kept
a
keen
eye
on
everything
she
felt
the
importance
of
the
occasion
the
young
mother
who
had
given
rise
to
all
this
solemnity
ate
in
sulky
discomfort
snatching
sullen
little
smiles
at
her
child
smiles
which
came
in
spite
of
her
when
she
felt
its
little
limbs
stirring
vigorously
on
her
lap
bertha
sharp
and
abrupt
was
chiefly
concerned
with
the
baby
she
scorned
her
sister
and
treated
her
like
dirt
but
the
infant
was
a
streak
of
light
to
her
miss
rowbotham
concerned
herself
with
the
function
and
the
conversation
her
hands
fluttered
she
talked
in
little
volleys
exceedingly
nervous
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
there
came
a
pause
the
old
man
wiped
his
mouth
with
his
red
handkerchief
then
his
blue
eyes
going
fixed
and
staring
he
began
to
speak
in
a
loose
slobbering
fashion
charging
his
words
at
the
clergyman
well
axed
you
to
come
her
ter
christen
this
childt
come
an
i
sure
we

thankful
i

poor
blessed
childt
miss
baptizing
an
they
are
for

to
church
he
seemed
to
lapse
into
a
muse
so
he
resumed
axed

to
come
here
to
do
the
job
i
not
sayin
as
it
not
on
us
it
is
i
breakin

one
thing
to

thankful
for
an
we
are
thankful
for
it
they
never
need
know
the
want
of
miss
rowbotham
the
lady
of
the
family
sat
very
stiff
and
pained
during
this
discourse
she
was
sensitive
to
so
many
things
that
she
was
bewildered
she
felt
her
young
sister
shame
then
a
kind
of
swift
protecting
love
for
the
baby
a
feeling
that
included
the
mother
she
was
at
a
loss
before
her
father
religious
sentiment
and
she
felt
and
resented
bitterly
the
mark
upon
the
family
against
which
the
common
folk
could
lift
their
fingers
still
she
winced
from
the
sound
of
her
father
words
it
was
a
painful
ordeal
it
is
hard
for
you
began
the
clergyman
in
his
soft
lingering
unworldly
voice
it
is
hard
for
you
today
but
the
lord
gives
comfort
in
his
time
a
man
child
is
born
unto
us
therefore
let
us
rejoice
and
be
glad
if
sin
has
entered
in
among
us
let
us
purify
out
hearts
before
the
lord
he
went
on
with
his
discourse
the
young
mother
lifted
the
whimpering
infant
till
its
face
was
hid
in
her
loose
hair
she
was
hurt
and
a
little
glowering
anger
shone
in
her
face
but
nevertheless
her
fingers
clasped
the
body
of
the
child
beautifully
she
was
stupefied
with
anger
against
this
emotion
let
loose
on
her
account
miss
bertha
rose
and
went
to
the
little
kitchen
returning
with
water
in
a
china
bowl
she
placed
it
there
among
the
well
we
all
ready
said
the
old
man
and
the
clergyman
began
to
read
the
service
miss
bertha
was
godmother
the
two
men
godfathers
the
old
man
sat
with
bent
head
the
scene
became
impressive
at
last
miss
bertha
took
the
child
and
put
it
in
the
arms
of
the
clergyman
he
big
and
ugly
shone
with
a
kind
of
unreal
love
he
had
never
mixed
with
life
and
women
were
all
unliving
biblical
things
to
him
when
he
asked
for
the
name
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
fiercely
joseph
william
after
me
he
said
almost
out
of
breath
joseph
william
i
baptize
thee
resounded
the
strange
full
chanting
voice
of
the
clergyman
the
baby
was
quite
still
let
us
pray
it
came
with
relief
to
them
all
they
knelt
before
their
chairs
all
but
the
young
mother
who
bent
and
hid
herself
over
her
baby
the
clergyman
began
his
hesitating
struggling
prayer
just
then
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
coming
up
the
path
ceasing
at
the
window
the
young
mother
glancing
up
saw
her
brother
black
in
his
pit
dirt
grinning
in
through
the
panes
his
red
mouth
curved
in
a
sneer
his
fair
hair
shone
above
his
blackened
skin
he
caught
the
eye
of
his
sister
and
grinned
then
his
black
face
disappeared
he
had
gone
on
into
the
kitchen
the
girl
with
the
child
sat
still
and
anger
filled
her
heart
she
herself
hated
now
the
praying
clergyman
and
the
whole
emotional
business
she
hated
her
brother
bitterly
in
anger
and
bondage
she
sat
and
listened
suddenly
her
father
began
to
pray
his
familiar
loud
rambling
voice
made
her
shut
herself
up
and
become
even
insentient
folks
said
his
mind
was
weakening
she
believed
it
to
be
true
and
kept
herself
always
disconnected
from
him
we
ask
thee
lord
the
old
man
cried
to
look
after
this
childt
fatherless
he
is
but
what
does
the
earthly
father
matter
before
thee
the
childt
is
thine
he
is
thy
childt
lord
what
father
has
a
man
but
thee
lord
when
a
man
says
he
is
a
father
he
is
wrong
from
the
first
word
for
thou
art
the
father
lord
lord
take
away
from
us
the
conceit
that
our
children
are
ours
lord
thou
art
father
of
this
childt
as
is
fatherless
here
o
god

bring
him
up
for
i
have
stood
between
thee
and
my
children
i
had
my
way
with
them
lord
i
stood
between
thee
and
my
children
i
cut
off
from
thee
because
they
were
mine
and
they
grown
twisted
because
of
me
who
is
their
father
lord
but
thee
but
i
put
myself
in
the
way
they
been
plants
under
a
stone
because
of
me
lord
if
it
had
been
for
me
they
might
ha
been
trees
in
the
sunshine
let
me
own
it
lord

done
mischief
it
could
ha
been
better
if
they
never
known
no
father
no
man
is
a
father
lord
only
thou
art
they
can
never
grow
beyond
thee
but
i
hampered
them
lift
up
again
and
undo
what
i
done
to
my
children
and
let
this
young
childt
be
like
a
willow
tree
beside
the
waters
with
no
father
but
thee
o
god
aye
an
i
wish
it
had
been
so
with
my
children
that
they
had
no
father
but
thee
for
i
been
like
a
stone
upon
them
and
they
rise
up
and
curse
me
in
their
wickedness
but
let
me
go
an
lift
thou
them
up
lord
the
minister
unaware
of
the
feelings
of
a
father
knelt
in
trouble
hearing
without
understanding
the
special
language
of
fatherhood
miss
rowbotham
alone
felt
and
understood
a
little
her
heart
began
to
flutter
she
was
in
pain
the
two
younger
daughters
kneeled
unhearing
stiffened
and
impervious
bertha
was
thinking
of
the
baby
and
the
younger
mother
thought
of
the
father
of
her
child
whom
she
hated
there
was
a
clatter
in
the
scullery
there
the
youngest
son
made
as
much
noise
as
he
could
pouring
out
the
water
for
his
wash
muttering
in
deep
anger
blortin
slaverin
old
fool
and
while
the
praying
of
his
father
continued
his
heart
was
burning
with
rage
on
the
table
was
a
paper
bag
he
picked
it
up
and
read
john
pastries
then
he
grinned
with
a
grimace
the
father
of
the
baby
was
baker
man
at
berryman
the
prayer
went
on
in
the
middle
kitchen
laurie
rowbotham
gathered
together
the
mouth
of
the
bag
inflated
it
and
burst
it
with
his
fist
there
was
a
loud
report
he
grinned
to
himself
but
he
writhed
at
the
same
time
with
shame
and
fear
of
his
father
the
father
broke
off
from
his
prayer
the
party
shuffled
to
their
feet
the
young
mother
went
into
the
scullery
what
art
doin
fool
she
said
the
collier
youth
tipped
the
baby
under
the
chin
singing
baker
man
bake
me
a
cake
as
fast
as
you
can
the
mother
snatched
the
child
away
shut
thy
mouth
she
said
the
colour
coming
into
her
cheek
prick
it
and
stick
it
and
mark
it
with
p
and
put
it
i
th
oven
for
baby
an
me
he
grinned
showing
a
grimy
and
jeering
and
unpleasant
red
mouth
and
white
teeth
i
s
thee
a
dab
ower
th
mouth
said
the
mother
of
the
baby
grimly
he
began
to
sing
again
and
she
struck
out
at
him
now
what
to
do
said
the
father
staggering
in
the
youth
began
to
sing
again
his
sister
stood
sullen
and
furious
why
does
that
upset
you
asked
the
eldest
miss
rowbotham
sharply
of
emma
the
mother
good
gracious
it
has
improved
your
miss
bertha
came
in
and
took
the
bonny
baby
the
father
sat
big
and
unheeding
in
his
chair
his
eyes
vacant
his
physique
wrecked
he
let
them
do
as
they
would
he
fell
to
pieces
and
yet
some
power
involuntary
like
a
curse
remained
in
him
the
very
ruin
of
him
was
like
a
lodestone
that
held
them
in
its
control
the
wreck
of
him
still
dominated
the
house
in
his
dissolution
even
he
compelled
their
being
they
had
never
lived
his
life
his
will
had
always
been
upon
them
and
contained
them
they
were
only
the
day
after
the
christening
he
staggered
in
at
the
doorway
declaring
in
a
loud
voice
with
joy
in
life
still
the
daisies
light
up
the
earth
they
clap
their
hands
in
multitudes
in
praise
of
the
and
his
daughters
shrank
sullen
odour
of
chrysanthemums
i
the
small
locomotive
engine
number
came
clanking
stumbling
down
from
selston
with
seven
full
waggons
it
appeared
round
the
corner
with
loud
threats
of
speed
but
the
colt
that
it
startled
from
among
the
gorse
which
still
flickered
indistinctly
in
the
raw
afternoon
outdistanced
it
at
a
canter
a
woman
walking
up
the
railway
line
to
underwood
drew
back
into
the
hedge
held
her
basket
aside
and
watched
the
footplate
of
the
engine
advancing
the
trucks
thumped
heavily
past
one
by
one
with
slow
inevitable
movement
as
she
stood
insignificantly
trapped
between
the
jolting
black
waggons
and
the
hedge
then
they
curved
away
towards
the
coppice
where
the
withered
oak
leaves
dropped
noiselessly
while
the
birds
pulling
at
the
scarlet
hips
beside
the
track
made
off
into
the
dusk
that
had
already
crept
into
the
spinney
in
the
open
the
smoke
from
the
engine
sank
and
cleaved
to
the
rough
grass
the
fields
were
dreary
and
forsaken
and
in
the
marshy
strip
that
led
to
the
whimsey
a
reedy
the
fowls
had
already
abandoned
their
run
among
the
alders
to
roost
in
the
tarred
the
loomed
up
beyond
the
pond
flames
like
red
sores
licking
its
ashy
sides
in
the
afternoon
stagnant
light
just
beyond
rose
the
tapering
chimneys
and
the
clumsy
black
headstocks
of
brinsley
colliery
the
two
wheels
were
spinning
fast
up
against
the
sky
and
the
rapped
out
its
little
spasms
the
miners
were
being
turned
up
the
engine
whistled
as
it
came
into
the
wide
bay
of
railway
lines
beside
the
colliery
where
rows
of
trucks
stood
in
harbour
miners
single
trailing
and
in
groups
passed
like
shadows
diverging
home
at
the
edge
of
the
ribbed
level
of
sidings
squat
a
low
cottage
three
steps
down
from
the
cinder
track
a
large
bony
vine
clutched
at
the
house
as
if
to
claw
down
the
tiled
roof
round
the
bricked
yard
grew
a
few
wintry
primroses
beyond
the
long
garden
sloped
down
to
a
brook
course
there
were
some
twiggy
apple
trees
trees
and
ragged
cabbages
beside
the
path
hung
dishevelled
pink
chrysanthemums
like
pink
cloths
hung
on
bushes
a
woman
came
stooping
out
of
the
down
the
garden
she
closed
and
padlocked
the
door
then
drew
herself
erect
having
brushed
some
bits
from
her
white
apron
she
was
a
tall
woman
of
imperious
mien
handsome
with
definite
black
eyebrows
her
smooth
black
hair
was
parted
exactly
for
a
few
moments
she
stood
steadily
watching
the
miners
as
they
passed
along
the
railway
then
she
turned
towards
the
brook
course
her
face
was
calm
and
set
her
mouth
was
closed
with
disillusionment
after
a
moment
she
called
john
there
was
no
answer
she
waited
and
then
said
distinctly
where
are
you
here
replied
a
child
sulky
voice
from
among
the
bushes
the
woman
looked
piercingly
through
the
dusk
are
you
at
that
brook
she
asked
sternly
for
answer
the
child
showed
himself
before
the
that
rose
like
whips
he
was
a
small
sturdy
boy
of
five
he
stood
quite
still
defiantly
oh
said
the
mother
conciliated
i
thought
you
were
down
at
that
wet
you
remember
what
i
told
the
boy
did
not
move
or
answer
come
come
on
in
she
said
more
gently
it
getting
dark
your
grandfather
engine
coming
down
the
line
the
lad
advanced
slowly
with
resentful
taciturn
movement
he
was
dressed
in
trousers
and
waistcoat
of
cloth
that
was
too
thick
and
hard
for
the
size
of
the
garments
they
were
evidently
cut
down
from
a
clothes
as
they
went
slowly
towards
the
house
he
tore
at
the
ragged
wisps
of
chrysanthemums
and
dropped
the
petals
in
handfuls
along
the
path
do
do
does
look
nasty
said
his
mother
he
refrained
and
she
suddenly
pitiful
broke
off
a
twig
with
three
or
four
wan
flowers
and
held
them
against
her
face
when
mother
and
son
reached
the
yard
her
hand
hesitated
and
instead
of
laying
the
flower
aside
she
pushed
it
in
her
the
mother
and
son
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
three
steps
looking
across
the
bay
of
lines
at
the
passing
home
of
the
miners
the
trundle
of
the
small
train
was
imminent
suddenly
the
engine
loomed
past
the
house
and
came
to
a
stop
opposite
the
gate
the
a
short
man
with
round
grey
beard
leaned
out
of
the
cab
high
above
the
woman
have
you
got
a
cup
of
tea
he
said
in
a
cheery
hearty
fashion
it
was
her
father
she
went
in
saying
she
would
mash
directly
she
returned
i
did
come
to
see
you
on
sunday
began
the
little
man
i
did
expect
you
said
his
daughter
the
winced
then
reassuming
his
cheery
airy
manner
he
said
oh
have
you
heard
then
well
and
what
do
you
i
think
it
is
soon
enough
she
replied
at
her
brief
censure
the
little
man
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
said
coaxingly
yet
with
dangerous
coldness
well
what
a
man
to
do
it
no
sort
of
life
for
a
man
of
my
years
to
sit
at
my
own
hearth
like
a
stranger
and
if
i
going
to
marry
again
it
may
as
well
be
soon
as
does
it
matter
to
anybody
the
woman
did
not
reply
but
turned
and
went
into
the
house
the
man
in
the
stood
assertive
till
she
returned
with
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
on
a
plate
she
went
up
the
steps
and
stood
near
the
footplate
of
the
hissing
engine
you
need
brought
me
bread
an
butter
said
her
father
but
a
cup
of
tea
sipped
it
very
he
sipped
for
a
moment
or
two
then
i
hear
as
walter
got
another
bout
on
he
said
when
has
he
said
the
woman
bitterly
i
heered
tell
of
him
in
the
nelson
braggin
as
he
was
going
to
spend
that
afore
he
went
half
a
sovereign
that
when
asked
the
woman
a
know
that
very
likely
she
laughed
bitterly
he
gives
me
aye
it
a
nice
thing
when
a
man
can
do
nothing
with
his
money
but
make
a
beast
of
himself
said
the
man
the
woman
turned
her
head
away
her
father
swallowed
the
last
of
his
tea
and
handed
her
the
cup
aye
he
sighed
wiping
his
mouth
it
a
settler
it
he
put
his
hand
on
the
lever
the
little
engine
strained
and
groaned
and
the
train
rumbled
towards
the
crossing
the
woman
again
looked
across
the
metals
darkness
was
settling
over
the
spaces
of
the
railway
and
trucks
the
miners
in
grey
sombre
groups
were
still
passing
home
the
pulsed
hurriedly
with
brief
pauses
elizabeth
bates
looked
at
the
dreary
flow
of
men
then
she
went
indoors
her
husband
did
not
come
the
kitchen
was
small
and
full
of
firelight
red
coals
piled
glowing
up
the
chimney
mouth
all
the
life
of
the
room
seemed
in
the
white
warm
hearth
and
the
steel
fender
reflecting
the
red
fire
the
cloth
was
laid
for
tea
cups
glinted
in
the
shadows
at
the
back
where
the
lowest
stairs
protruded
into
the
room
the
boy
sat
struggling
with
a
knife
and
a
piece
of
whitewood
he
was
almost
hidden
in
the
shadow
it
was
four
they
had
but
to
await
the
father
coming
to
begin
tea
as
the
mother
watched
her
son
sullen
little
struggle
with
the
wood
she
saw
herself
in
his
silence
and
pertinacity
she
saw
the
father
in
her
child
indifference
to
all
but
himself
she
seemed
to
be
occupied
by
her
husband
he
had
probably
gone
past
his
home
slunk
past
his
own
door
to
drink
before
he
came
in
while
his
dinner
spoiled
and
wasted
in
waiting
she
glanced
at
the
clock
then
took
the
potatoes
to
strain
them
in
the
yard
the
garden
and
fields
beyond
the
brook
were
closed
in
uncertain
darkness
when
she
rose
with
the
saucepan
leaving
the
drain
steaming
into
the
night
behind
her
she
saw
the
yellow
lamps
were
lit
along
the
high
road
that
went
up
the
hill
away
beyond
the
space
of
the
railway
lines
and
the
field
then
again
she
watched
the
men
trooping
home
fewer
now
and
fewer
indoors
the
fire
was
sinking
and
the
room
was
dark
red
the
woman
put
her
saucepan
on
the
hob
and
set
a
batter
pudding
near
the
mouth
of
the
oven
then
she
stood
unmoving
directly
gratefully
came
quick
young
steps
to
the
door
someone
hung
on
the
latch
a
moment
then
a
little
girl
entered
and
began
pulling
off
her
outdoor
things
dragging
a
mass
of
curls
just
ripening
from
gold
to
brown
over
her
eyes
with
her
hat
her
mother
chid
her
for
coming
late
from
school
and
said
she
would
have
to
keep
her
at
home
the
dark
winter
days
why
mother
it
hardly
a
bit
dark
yet
the
lamp
not
lighted
and
my
father
not
no
he
is
but
it
a
quarter
to
five
did
you
see
anything
of
him
the
child
became
serious
she
looked
at
her
mother
with
large
wistful
blue
eyes
no
mother
i
never
seen
him
why
has
he
come
up
an
gone
past
to
old
brinsley
he
has
mother
i
never
saw
he
watch
that
said
the
mother
bitterly
he
take
care
as
you
did
see
him
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
seated
in
the
o
wales
he
would
be
this
the
girl
looked
at
her
mother
piteously
let
have
our
teas
mother
should
we
said
she
the
mother
called
john
to
table
she
opened
the
door
once
more
and
looked
out
across
the
darkness
of
the
lines
all
was
deserted
she
could
not
hear
the
perhaps
she
said
to
herself
he
stopped
to
get
some
ripping
they
sat
down
to
tea
john
at
the
end
of
the
table
near
the
door
was
almost
lost
in
the
darkness
their
faces
were
hidden
from
each
other
the
girl
crouched
against
the
fender
slowly
moving
a
thick
piece
of
bread
before
the
fire
the
lad
his
face
a
dusky
mark
on
the
shadow
sat
watching
her
who
was
transfigured
in
the
red
glow
i
do
think
it
beautiful
to
look
in
the
fire
said
the
child
do
you
said
her
mother
why
it
so
red
and
full
of
little
it
feels
so
nice
and
you
can
fair
smell
it
want
mending
directly
replied
her
mother
and
then
if
your
father
comes
he
carry
on
and
say
there
never
is
a
fire
when
a
man
comes
home
sweating
from
the
pit
a
is
always
warm
there
was
silence
till
the
boy
said
complainingly
make
haste
our
well
i
am
doing
i
ca
make
the
fire
do
it
no
faster

i
she

wafflin
it
about
so
to
make
slow
grumbled
the
boy
do
have
such
an
evil
imagination
child
replied
the
mother
soon
the
room
was
busy
in
the
darkness
with
the
crisp
sound
of
crunching
the
mother
ate
very
little
she
drank
her
tea
determinedly
and
sat
thinking
when
she
rose
her
anger
was
evident
in
the
stern
unbending
of
her
head
she
looked
at
the
pudding
in
the
fender
and
broke
out
it
is
a
scandalous
thing
as
a
man
ca
even
come
home
to
his
dinner
if
it
crozzled
up
to
a
cinder
i
do
see
why
i
should
care
past
his
very
door
he
goes
to
get
to
a
and
here
i
sit
with
his
dinner
waiting
for
she
went
out
as
she
dropped
piece
after
piece
of
coal
on
the
red
fire
the
shadows
fell
on
the
walls
till
the
room
was
almost
in
total
darkness
i
canna
see
grumbled
the
invisible
john
in
spite
of
herself
the
mother
laughed
you
know
the
way
to
your
mouth
she
said
she
set
the
dustpan
outside
the
door
when
she
came
again
like
a
shadow
on
the
hearth
the
lad
repeated
complaining
sulkily
i
canna
good
gracious
cried
the
mother
irritably
you
as
bad
as
your
father
if
it
a
bit
dusk
nevertheless
she
took
a
paper
spill
from
a
sheaf
on
the
mantelpiece
and
proceeded
to
light
the
lamp
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
she
reached
up
her
figure
displayed
itself
just
rounding
with
maternity
oh
exclaimed
the
girl
what
said
the
woman
suspended
in
the
act
of
putting
the
lamp
glass
over
the
flame
the
copper
reflector
shone
handsomely
on
her
as
she
stood
with
uplifted
arm
turning
to
face
her
daughter
you
got
a
flower
in
your
apron
said
the
child
in
a
little
rapture
at
this
unusual
event
goodness
me
exclaimed
the
woman
relieved
one
would
think
the
house
was
she
replaced
the
glass
and
waited
a
moment
before
turning
up
the
wick
a
pale
shadow
was
seen
floating
vaguely
on
the
floor
let
me
smell
said
the
child
still
rapturously
coming
forward
and
putting
her
face
to
her
mother
waist
go
along
silly
said
the
mother
turning
up
the
lamp
the
light
revealed
their
suspense
so
that
the
woman
felt
it
almost
unbearable
annie
was
still
bending
at
her
waist
irritably
the
mother
took
the
flowers
out
from
her
oh
take
them
out
annie
cried
catching
her
hand
and
trying
to
replace
the
sprig
such
nonsense
said
the
mother
turning
away
the
child
put
the
pale
chrysanthemums
to
her
lips
murmuring
do
they
smell
beautiful
her
mother
gave
a
short
laugh
no
she
said
not
to
me
it
was
chrysanthemums
when
i
married
him
and
chrysanthemums
when
you
were
born
and
the
first
time
they
ever
brought
him
home
drunk
he
got
brown
chrysanthemums
in
his
she
looked
at
the
children
their
eyes
and
their
parted
lips
were
wondering
the
mother
sat
rocking
in
silence
for
some
time
then
she
looked
at
the
clock
twenty
minutes
to
six
in
a
tone
of
fine
bitter
carelessness
she
continued
eh
he
not
come
now
till
they
bring
him
there
stick
but
he
need
come
rolling
in
here
in
his
for
i
wash
him
he
can
lie
on
the
eh
what
a
fool
i
been
what
a
fool
and
this
is
what
i
came
here
for
to
this
dirty
hole
rats
and
all
for
him
to
slink
past
his
very
door
twice
last
begun
she
silenced
herself
and
rose
to
clear
the
table
while
for
an
hour
or
more
the
children
played
subduedly
intent
fertile
of
imagination
united
in
fear
of
the
mother
wrath
and
in
dread
of
their
father
mrs
bates
sat
in
her
making
a
of
thick
flannel
which
gave
a
dull
wounded
sound
as
she
tore
off
the
grey
edge
she
worked
at
her
sewing
with
energy
listening
to
the
children
and
her
anger
wearied
itself
lay
down
to
rest
opening
its
eyes
from
time
to
time
and
steadily
watching
its
ears
raised
to
listen
sometimes
even
her
anger
quailed
and
shrank
and
the
mother
suspended
her
sewing
tracing
the
footsteps
that
thudded
along
the
sleepers
outside
she
would
lift
her
head
sharply
to
bid
the
children
but
she
recovered
herself
in
time
and
the
footsteps
went
past
the
gate
and
the
children
were
not
flung
out
of
their
playing
world
but
at
last
annie
sighed
and
gave
in
she
glanced
at
her
waggon
of
slippers
and
loathed
the
game
she
turned
plaintively
to
her
mother
mother
she
was
inarticulate
john
crept
out
like
a
frog
from
under
the
sofa
his
mother
glanced
up
yes
she
said
just
look
at
those
the
boy
held
them
out
to
survey
them
saying
nothing
then
somebody
called
in
a
hoarse
voice
away
down
the
line
and
suspense
bristled
in
the
room
till
two
people
had
gone
by
outside
talking
it
is
time
for
bed
said
the
mother
my
father
has
come
wailed
annie
plaintively
but
her
mother
was
primed
with
courage
never
mind
they
bring
him
when
he
does
a
she
meant
there
would
be
no
scene
and
he
may
sleep
on
the
floor
till
he
wakes
himself
i
know
he
not
go
to
work
tomorrow
after
this
the
children
had
their
hands
and
faces
wiped
with
a
flannel
they
were
very
quiet
when
they
had
put
on
their
nightdresses
they
said
their
prayers
the
boy
mumbling
the
mother
looked
down
at
them
at
the
brown
silken
bush
of
intertwining
curls
in
the
nape
of
the
girl
neck
at
the
little
black
head
of
the
lad
and
her
heart
burst
with
anger
at
their
father
who
caused
all
three
such
distress
the
children
hid
their
faces
in
her
skirts
for
comfort
when
mrs
bates
came
down
the
room
was
strangely
empty
with
a
tension
of
expectancy
she
took
up
her
sewing
and
stitched
for
some
time
without
raising
her
head
meantime
her
anger
was
tinged
with
fear
ii
the
clock
struck
eight
and
she
rose
suddenly
dropping
her
sewing
on
her
chair
she
went
to
the
stairfoot
door
opened
it
listening
then
she
went
out
locking
the
door
behind
her
something
scuffled
in
the
yard
and
she
started
though
she
knew
it
was
only
the
rats
with
which
the
place
was
overrun
the
night
was
very
dark
in
the
great
bay
of
railway
lines
bulked
with
trucks
there
was
no
trace
of
light
only
away
back
she
could
see
a
few
yellow
lamps
at
the
and
the
red
smear
of
the
burning
on
the
night
she
hurried
along
the
edge
of
the
track
then
crossing
the
converging
lines
came
to
the
stile
by
the
white
gates
whence
she
emerged
on
the
road
then
the
fear
which
had
led
her
shrank
people
were
walking
up
to
new
brinsley
she
saw
the
lights
in
the
houses
twenty
yards
further
on
were
the
broad
windows
of
the
of
wales
very
warm
and
bright
and
the
loud
voices
of
men
could
be
heard
distinctly
what
a
fool
she
had
been
to
imagine
that
anything
had
happened
to
him
he
was
merely
drinking
over
there
at
the
of
wales
she
faltered
she
had
never
yet
been
to
fetch
him
and
she
never
would
go
so
she
continued
her
walk
towards
the
long
straggling
line
of
houses
standing
blank
on
the
highway
she
entered
a
passage
between
the
dwellings
mr
rigley
did
you
want
him
no
he
not
in
at
this
the
woman
leaned
forward
from
her
dark
scullery
and
peered
at
the
other
upon
whom
fell
a
dim
light
through
the
blind
of
the
kitchen
window
is
it
mrs
bates
she
asked
in
a
tone
tinged
with
respect

an
awkward
pause
jack
never

mester
she
said
no

he
stuck
in
there
elizabeth
bates
said
this
bitterly
and
with
recklessness
she
knew
that
the
woman
across
the
yard
was
standing
at
her
door
listening
but
she
did
not
care
as
she
turned

elizabeth
bates
murmuring
a
remonstrance
stepped
inside
the
other
woman
apologized
for
the
state
of
the
room
the
kitchen
needed
apology
there
were
little
frocks
and
trousers
and
childish
undergarments
on
the
squab
and
on
the
floor
and
a
litter
of
playthings
everywhere
on
the
black
american
cloth
of
the
table

pieces
of
bread
and
cake
crusts

and
a
teapot

cold
tea

elizabeth

noting
with
faint
disapproval
the
general
untidiness
of
the
room

she
fell
to
counting
the
shoes
of
various
sizes
scattered
over
the
floor
there

sighed
and
said
to
herself

elizabeth

with

as

stumbled
up

entry
elizabeth
bates
heard
rigley
wife
run
across
the
yard
and
open
her
neighbour
door
at

the
house
was
quiet
elizabeth
bates
took
off
her
hat
and
shawl
and
rolled
back
the
rug
when
she
had
finished
she
sat
down
it
was
a
few
minutes
past
nine
she
was
startled
by
the
rapid
chuff
of
the
at
the
pit
and
the
sharp
whirr
of
the
brakes
on
the
rope
as
it
descended
again
she
felt
the
painful
sweep
of
her
blood
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
side
saying
aloud
good
gracious
only
the
nine
deputy
going
down
rebuking
herself
she
sat
still
listening
half
an
hour
of
this
and
she
was
wearied
out
what
am
i
working
myself
up
like
this
for
she
said
pitiably
to
herself
i
s
only
be
doing
myself
some
she
took
out
her
sewing
again
at
a
quarter
to
ten
there
were
footsteps
one
person
she
watched
for
the
door
to
open
it
was
an
elderly
woman
in
a
black
bonnet
and
a
black
woollen
mother
she
was
about
sixty
years
old
pale
with
blue
eyes
and
her
face
all
wrinkled
and
lamentable
she
shut
the
door
and
turned
to
her
peevishly
eh
lizzie
whatever
shall
we
do
whatever
shall
we
do
she
cried
elizabeth
drew
back
a
little
sharply
what
is
it
mother
she
said
the
elder
woman
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
i
do
know
child
i
ca
tell
you
shook
her
head
slowly
elizabeth
sat
watching
her
anxious
and
vexed
i
do
know
replied
the
grandmother
sighing
very
deeply
no
end
to
my
troubles
there
is
the
things
i
gone
through
i
sure
it
she
wept
without
wiping
her
eyes
the
tears
running
but
mother
interrupted
elizabeth
what
do
you
mean
what
is
it
the
grandmother
slowly
wiped
her
eyes
the
fountains
of
her
tears
were
stopped
by
elizabeth
directness
she
wiped
her
eyes
slowly
poor
child
eh
you
poor
thing
she
moaned
i
do
know
what
going
to
do
i
you
as
you
a
thing
it
is
indeed
elizabeth
waited
is
he
dead
she
asked
and
at
the
words
her
heart
swung
violently
though
she
felt
a
slight
flush
of
shame
at
the
ultimate
extravagance
of
the
question
her
words
sufficiently
frightened
the
old
lady
almost
brought
her
to
herself
do
say
so
elizabeth
we
hope
it
not
as
bad
as
that
no
may
the
lord
spare
us
that
elizabeth
jack
rigley
came
just
as
i
was
sittin
down
to
a
glass
afore
going
to
bed
an
said

word
afore

gone
an
i
put
my
bonnet

an
come
straight
down
lizzie
i
thought
to
myself
that
poor
blessed
child
if

an
tell
her
of
a
sudden
there
no
knowin
what
to
you
must
let
it
upset
you
you
know
what
to
expect
how
long
is
it
six
is
it
five
lizzie
ay
old
woman
shook
her
time
slips
on
it
slips
on
ay
elizabeth
thoughts
were
busy
elsewhere
if
he
was
she
be
able
to
manage
on
the
little
pension
and
what
she
could
earn
counted
up
rapidly
if
he
was
would
take
him
to
the
tiresome
he
would
be
to
nurse
perhaps
she
be
able
to
get
him
away
from
the
drink
and
his
hateful
ways
she
he
was
ill
the
tears
offered
to
come
to
her
eyes
at
the
picture
but
what
sentimental
luxury
was
this
she
was
beginning
turned
to
consider
the
children
at
any
rate
she
was
absolutely
necessary
for
them
they
were
her
business
ay
repeated
the
old
woman
it
seems
but
a
week
or
two
since
he
brought
me
his
first
wages
was
a
good
lad
elizabeth
he
was
in
his
way
i
do
know
why
he
got
to
be
such
a
trouble
i
do
he
was
a
happy
lad
at
home
only
full
of
spirits
but
there
no
mistake
been
a
handful
of
trouble
he
has
i
hope
the
lord
spare
him
to
mend
his
ways
i
hope
so
i
hope
so
you
had
a
sight
o
trouble
with
him
elizabeth
you
have
indeed
but
he
was
a
jolly
enough
lad
wi
me
he
was
i
can
assure
you
i
do
know
how
it
is
the
old
woman
continued
to
muse
aloud
a
monotonous
irritating
sound
while
elizabeth
thought
concentratedly
startled
once
when
she
heard
the
chuff
quickly
and
the
brakes
skirr
with
a
shriek
then
she
heard
the
engine
more
slowly
and
the
brakes
made
no
sound
the
old
woman
did
not
notice
elizabeth
waited
in
suspense
the
talked
with
lapses
into
silence
but
he
was
your
son
lizzie
an
it
makes
a
difference
whatever
he
was
i
remember
him
when
he
was
little
an
i
learned
to
understand
him
and
to
make
allowances
you
got
to
make
allowances
for
it
was
ten
and
the
old
woman
was
saying
but
it
trouble
from
beginning
to
end
you
never
too
old
for
trouble
never
too
old
for
when
the
gate
banged
back
and
there
were
heavy
feet
on
the
steps
i
go
lizzie
let
me
go
cried
the
old
woman
rising
but
elizabeth
was
at
the
door
it
was
a
man
in
they
bringin
missis
he
said
elizabeth
heart
halted
a
moment
then
it
surged
on
again
almost
suffocating
her
is
it
bad
she
asked
the
man
turned
away
looking
at
the
darkness
the
doctor
says
been
dead
hours
saw
i
th
the
old
woman
who
stood
just
behind
elizabeth
dropped
into
a
chair
and
folded
her
hands
crying
oh
my
boy
my
boy
hush
said
elizabeth
with
a
sharp
twitch
of
a
frown
be
still
mother
do
waken
th
children
i
would
have
them
down
for
anything
the
old
woman
moaned
softly
rocking
herself
the
man
was
drawing
away
elizabeth
took
a
step
forward
how
was
it
she
asked
well
i
could
say
for
sure
the
man
replied
very
ill
at
ease
wor
finishin
a
stint
an
th
butties
gone
an
a
lot
o
stuff
come
down
atop
and
crushed

cried
the
widow
with
a
shudder
no
said
the
man
it
fell
at
th
back
of
wor
under
th
face
an
it
niver

it
shut
in
it
seems
wor
elizabeth
shrank
back
she
heard
the
old
woman
behind
her
cry
what
did
say
it
was
the
man
replied
more
loudly
wor
smothered
then
the
old
woman
wailed
aloud
and
this
relieved
elizabeth
oh
mother
she
said
putting
her
hand
on
the
old
woman
do
waken
th
children
do
waken
th
she
wept
a
little
unknowing
while
the
old
mother
rocked
herself
and
moaned
elizabeth
remembered
that
they
were
bringing
him
home
and
she
must
be
ready
they
lay
him
in
the
parlour
she
said
to
herself
standing
a
moment
pale
and
perplexed
then
she
lighted
a
candle
and
went
into
the
tiny
room
the
air
was
cold
and
damp
but
she
could
not
make
a
fire
there
was
no
fireplace
she
set
down
the
candle
and
looked
round
the
glittered
on
the
on
the
two
vases
that
held
some
of
the
pink
chrysanthemums
and
on
the
dark
mahogany
there
was
a
cold
deathly
smell
of
chrysanthemums
in
the
room
elizabeth
stood
looking
at
the
flowers
she
turned
away
and
calculated
whether
there
would
be
room
to
lay
him
on
the
floor
between
the
couch
and
the
chiffonier
she
pushed
the
chairs
aside
there
would
be
room
to
lay
him
down
and
to
step
round
him
then
she
fetched
the
old
red
tablecloth
and
another
old
cloth
spreading
them
down
to
save
her
bit
of
carpet
she
shivered
on
leaving
the
parlour
so
from
the
she
took
a
clean
shirt
and
put
it
at
the
fire
to
air
all
the
time
her
was
rocking
herself
in
the
chair
and
moaning
you
have
to
move
from
there
mother
said
elizabeth
they
be
bringing
him
in
come
in
the
the
old
mother
rose
mechanically
and
seated
herself
by
the
fire
continuing
to
lament
elizabeth
went
into
the
pantry
for
another
candle
and
there
in
the
little
penthouse
under
the
naked
tiles
she
heard
them
coming
she
stood
still
in
the
pantry
doorway
listening
she
heard
them
pass
the
end
of
the
house
and
come
awkwardly
down
the
three
steps
a
jumble
of
shuffling
footsteps
and
muttering
voices
the
old
woman
was
silent
the
men
were
in
the
yard
then
elizabeth
heard
matthews
the
manager
of
the
pit
say
you
go
in
first
jim
mind
the
door
came
open
and
the
two
women
saw
a
collier
backing
into
the
room
holding
one
end
of
a
stretcher
on
which
they
could
see
the
nailed
of
the
dead
man
the
two
carriers
halted
the
man
at
the
head
stooping
to
the
lintel
of
the
door
wheer
will
you
have
him
asked
the
manager
a
short
man
elizabeth
roused
herself
and
came
from
the
pantry
carrying
the
unlighted
candle
in
the
parlour
she
said
in
there
jim
pointed
the
manager
and
the
carriers
backed
round
into
the
tiny
room
the
coat
with
which
they
had
covered
the
body
fell
off
as
they
awkwardly
turned
through
the
two
doorways
and
the
women
saw
their
man
naked
to
the
waist
lying
stripped
for
work
the
old
woman
began
to
moan
in
a
low
voice
of
horror
lay
th
stretcher
at
th
side
snapped
the
manager
an
put
on
th
cloths
mind
now
mind
look
you
one
of
the
men
had
knocked
off
a
vase
of
chrysanthemums
he
stared
awkwardly
then
they
set
down
the
stretcher
elizabeth
did
not
look
at
her
husband
as
soon
as
she
could
get
in
the
room
she
went
and
picked
up
the
broken
vase
and
the
flowers
wait
a
minute
she
said
the
three
men
waited
in
silence
while
she
mopped
up
the
water
with
a
duster
eh
what
a
job
what
a
job
to
be
sure
the
manager
was
saying
rubbing
his
brow
with
trouble
and
perplexity
never
knew
such
a
thing
in
my
life
never
he
no
business
to
ha
been
left
i
never
knew
such
a
thing
in
my
life
fell
over
him
clean
as
a
whistle
an
shut
him
in
not
four
foot
of
space
there
it
scarce
bruised
he
looked
down
at
the
dead
man
lying
prone
half
naked
all
grimed
with
the
doctor
said
it
is
the
most
terrible
job
i
ever
known
seems
as
if
it
was
done
o
purpose
clean
over
him
an
shut
in
like
a
made
a
sharp
descending
gesture
with
his
hand
the
colliers
standing
by
jerked
aside
their
heads
in
hopeless
comment
the
horror
of
the
thing
bristled
upon
them
all
then
they
heard
the
girl
voice
upstairs
calling
shrilly
mother
is
it
mother
who
is
it
elizabeth
hurried
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
go
to
sleep
she
commanded
sharply
what
are
you
shouting
about
go
to
sleep
at
then
she
began
to
mount
the
stairs
they
could
hear
her
on
the
boards
and
on
the
plaster
floor
of
the
little
bedroom
they
could
hear
her
distinctly
what
the
matter
now
the
matter
with
you
silly
thing
voice
was
much
agitated
with
an
unreal
gentleness
i
thought
it
was
some
men
come
said
the
plaintive
voice
of
the
child
has
he
come
yes
they
brought
him
there
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
go
to
sleep
now
like
a
good
they
could
hear
her
voice
in
the
bedroom
they
waited
whilst
she
covered
the
children
under
the
bedclothes
is
he
drunk
asked
the
girl
timidly
faintly
no
not
is
he
asleep
downstairs
do
make
a
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
the
men
heard
the
frightened
child
again
what
that
noise
it
nothing
i
tell
you
what
are
you
bothering
for
the
noise
was
the
grandmother
moaning
she
was
oblivious
of
everything
sitting
on
her
chair
rocking
and
moaning
the
manager
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
and
bade
her
the
old
woman
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
she
was
shocked
by
this
interruption
and
seemed
to
wonder
what
time
is
it
plaintive
thin
voice
of
the
child
sinking
back
unhappily
into
sleep
asked
this
last
question
ten
answered
the
mother
more
softly
then
she
must
have
bent
down
and
kissed
the
children
matthews
beckoned
to
the
men
to
come
away
they
put
on
their
caps
and
took
up
the
stretcher
stepping
over
the
body
they
tiptoed
out
of
the
house
none
of
them
spoke
till
they
were
far
from
the
wakeful
children
when
elizabeth
came
down
she
found
her
mother
alone
on
the
parlour
floor
leaning
over
the
dead
man
the
tears
dropping
on
him
we
must
lay
him
out
the
wife
said
she
put
on
the
kettle
then
returning
knelt
at
the
feet
and
began
to
unfasten
the
knotted
leather
laces
the
room
was
clammy
and
dim
with
only
one
candle
so
that
she
had
to
bend
her
face
almost
to
the
floor
at
last
she
got
off
the
heavy
boots
and
put
them
away
you
must
help
me
now
she
whispered
to
the
old
woman
together
they
stripped
the
man
when
they
arose
saw
him
lying
in
the
naïve
dignity
of
death
the
women
stood
arrested
in
fear
and
respect
for
a
few
moments
they
remained
still
looking
down
the
old
mother
whimpering
elizabeth
felt
countermanded
she
saw
him
how
utterly
inviolable
he
lay
in
himself
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
she
could
not
accept
it
stooping
she
laid
her
hand
on
him
in
claim
he
was
still
warm
for
the
mine
was
hot
where
he
had
died
his
mother
had
his
face
between
her
hands
and
was
murmuring
incoherently
the
old
tears
fell
in
succession
as
drops
from
wet
leaves
the
mother
was
not
weeping
merely
her
tears
flowed
elizabeth
embraced
the
body
of
her
husband
with
cheek
and
lips
she
seemed
to
be
listening
inquiring
trying
to
get
some
connection
but
she
could
not
she
was
driven
away
he
was
impregnable
she
rose
went
into
the
kitchen
where
she
poured
warm
water
into
a
bowl
brought
soap
and
flannel
and
a
soft
towel
i
must
wash
him
she
said
then
the
old
mother
rose
stiffly
and
watched
elizabeth
as
she
carefully
washed
his
face
carefully
brushing
the
big
blond
moustache
from
his
mouth
with
the
flannel
she
was
afraid
with
a
bottomless
fear
so
she
ministered
to
him
the
old
woman
jealous
said
let
me
wipe
him
she
kneeled
on
the
other
side
drying
slowly
as
elizabeth
washed
her
big
black
bonnet
sometimes
brushing
the
dark
head
of
her
daughter
they
worked
thus
in
silence
for
a
long
time
they
never
forgot
it
was
death
and
the
touch
of
the
man
dead
body
gave
them
strange
emotions
different
in
each
of
the
women
a
great
dread
possessed
them
both
the
mother
felt
the
lie
was
given
to
her
womb
she
was
denied
the
wife
felt
the
utter
isolation
of
the
human
soul
the
child
within
her
was
a
weight
apart
from
her
at
last
it
was
finished
he
was
a
man
of
handsome
body
and
his
face
showed
no
traces
of
drink
he
was
blonde
with
fine
limbs
but
he
was
dead
bless
him
whispered
his
mother
looking
always
at
his
face
and
speaking
out
of
sheer
terror
dear
him
she
spoke
in
a
faint
sibilant
ecstasy
of
fear
and
mother
love
elizabeth
sank
down
again
to
the
floor
and
put
her
face
against
his
neck
and
trembled
and
shuddered
but
she
had
to
draw
away
again
he
was
dead
and
her
living
flesh
had
no
place
against
his
a
great
dread
and
weariness
held
her
she
was
so
unavailing
her
life
was
gone
like
this
white
as
milk
he
is
clear
as
a
baby
bless
him
the
darling
the
old
mother
murmured
to
herself
not
a
mark
on
him
clear
and
clean
and
white
beautiful
as
ever
a
child
was
made
she
murmured
with
pride
elizabeth
kept
her
face
hidden
he
went
peaceful
as
sleep
is
he
beautiful
the
lamb
must
ha
made
his
peace
lizzie
he
made
it
all
right
lizzie
shut
in
there
he
have
time
he
would
look
like
this
if
he
had
made
his
peace
the
lamb
the
dear
lamb
eh
but
he
had
a
hearty
laugh
i
loved
to
hear
it
he
had
the
heartiest
laugh
lizzie
as
a
elizabeth
looked
up
the
man
mouth
was
fallen
back
slightly
open
under
the
cover
of
the
moustache
the
eyes
half
shut
did
not
show
glazed
in
the
obscurity
life
with
its
smoky
burning
gone
from
him
had
left
him
apart
and
utterly
alien
to
her
and
she
knew
what
a
stranger
he
was
to
her
in
her
womb
was
ice
of
fear
because
of
this
separate
stranger
with
whom
she
had
been
living
as
one
flesh
was
this
what
it
all
intact
separateness
obscured
by
heat
of
living
in
dread
she
turned
her
face
away
the
fact
was
too
deadly
there
had
been
nothing
between
them
and
yet
they
had
come
together
exchanging
their
nakedness
repeatedly
each
time
he
had
taken
her
they
had
been
two
isolated
beings
far
apart
as
now
he
was
no
more
responsible
than
she
the
child
was
like
ice
in
her
womb
for
as
she
looked
at
the
dead
man
her
mind
cold
and
detached
said
clearly
who
am
i
what
have
i
been
doing
i
have
been
fighting
a
husband
who
did
not
exist
he
existed
all
the
time
what
wrong
have
i
done
what
was
that
i
have
been
living
with
there
lies
the
reality
this
her
soul
died
in
her
for
fear
she
knew
she
had
never
seen
him
he
had
never
seen
her
they
had
met
in
the
dark
and
had
fought
in
the
dark
not
knowing
whom
they
met
nor
whom
they
fought
and
now
she
saw
and
turned
silent
in
seeing
for
she
had
been
wrong
she
had
said
he
was
something
he
was
not
she
had
felt
familiar
with
him
whereas
he
was
apart
all
the
while
living
as
she
never
lived
feeling
as
she
never
felt
in
fear
and
shame
she
looked
at
his
naked
body
that
she
had
known
falsely
and
he
was
the
father
of
her
children
her
soul
was
torn
from
her
body
and
stood
apart
she
looked
at
his
naked
body
and
was
ashamed
as
if
she
had
denied
it
after
all
it
was
itself
it
seemed
awful
to
her
she
looked
at
his
face
and
she
turned
her
own
face
to
the
wall
for
his
look
was
other
than
hers
his
way
was
not
her
way
she
had
denied
him
what
he
saw
it
now
she
had
refused
him
as
this
had
been
her
life
and
his
was
grateful
to
death
which
restored
the
truth
and
she
knew
she
was
not
dead
and
all
the
while
her
heart
was
bursting
with
grief
and
pity
for
him
what
had
he
suffered
what
stretch
of
horror
for
this
helpless
man
she
was
rigid
with
agony
she
had
not
been
able
to
help
him
he
had
been
cruelly
injured
this
naked
man
this
other
being
and
she
could
make
no
reparation
there
were
the
the
children
belonged
to
life
this
dead
man
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
he
and
she
were
only
channels
through
which
life
had
flowed
to
issue
in
the
children
she
was
a
how
awful
she
knew
it
now
to
have
been
a
wife
and
he
dead
now
how
awful
he
must
have
felt
it
to
be
a
husband
she
felt
that
in
the
next
world
he
would
be
a
stranger
to
her
if
they
met
there
in
the
beyond
they
would
only
be
ashamed
of
what
had
been
before
the
children
had
come
for
some
mysterious
reason
out
of
both
of
them
but
the
children
did
not
unite
them
now
he
was
dead
she
knew
how
eternally
he
was
apart
from
her
how
eternally
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
her
she
saw
this
episode
of
her
life
closed
they
had
denied
each
other
in
life
now
he
had
withdrawn
an
anguish
came
over
her
it
was
finished
then
it
had
become
hopeless
between
them
long
before
he
died
yet
he
had
been
her
husband
but
how
little
have
you
got
his
shirt
elizabeth
turned
without
answering
though
she
strove
to
weep
and
behave
as
her
expected
but
she
could
not
she
was
silenced
she
went
into
the
kitchen
and
returned
with
the
garment
it
is
aired
she
said
grasping
the
cotton
shirt
here
and
there
to
try
she
was
almost
ashamed
to
handle
him
what
right
had
she
or
anyone
to
lay
hands
on
him
but
her
touch
was
humble
on
his
body
it
was
hard
work
to
clothe
him
he
was
so
heavy
and
inert
a
terrible
dread
gripped
her
all
the
while
that
he
could
be
so
heavy
and
utterly
inert
unresponsive
apart
the
horror
of
the
distance
between
them
was
almost
too
much
for
was
so
infinite
a
gap
she
must
look
across
at
last
it
was
finished
they
covered
him
with
a
sheet
and
left
him
lying
with
his
face
bound
and
she
fastened
the
door
of
the
little
parlour
lest
the
children
should
see
what
was
lying
there
then
with
peace
sunk
heavy
on
her
heart
she
went
about
making
tidy
the
kitchen
she
knew
she
submitted
to
life
which
was
her
immediate
master
but
from
death
her
ultimate
master
she
winced
with
fear
and
shame
