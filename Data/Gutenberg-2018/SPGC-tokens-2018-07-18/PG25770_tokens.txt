chapter
i
the
night
of
the
storm
it
had
been
a
magnificent
afternoon
so
wonderful
that
leslie
hated
to
break
the
spell
reluctantly
she
unrolled
herself
from
the
indian
blanket
from
which
she
emerged
like
a
butterfly
from
a
cocoon
draped
it
over
her
arm
picked
up
the
book
she
had
not
once
opened
and
turned
for
a
last
lingering
look
at
the
ocean
a
lavender
haze
lay
lightly
along
the
horizon
nearer
inshore
the
blue
of
sea
and
sky
was
intense
a
line
of
breakers
raced
shoreward
their
white
manes
streaming
back
in
the
wind
best
of
all
leslie
loved
the
flawless
green
of
their
curve
at
the
instant
before
they
crashed
on
the
beach
oh
but
the
ocean
wonderful
in
october
she
murmured
aloud
i
never
had
any
idea
wonderful
i
never
saw
it
in
this
month
before
come
rags
a
english
his
name
corresponding
closely
to
his
appearance
came
racing
up
the
beach
at
her
call
did
you
find
it
hard
to
tear
yourself
away
from
the
ragsie
she
laughed
you
must
have
gobbled
down
more
than
a
hundred
it
high
time
you
left
off
she
started
to
race
along
the
deserted
beach
the
dog
leaping
ahead
of
her
and
yapping
ecstatically
twice
she
stopped
to
pick
up
some
driftwood
we
need
it
to
get
supper
rags
she
informed
the
dog
our
stock
is
getting
low
he
cocked
one
ear
at
her
intelligently
they
came
presently
to
a
couple
of
summer
bungalows
set
side
by
side
about
two
hundred
feet
from
the
ocean
edge
they
were
long
and
low
each
with
a
wide
veranda
stretching
across
the
front
there
were
no
other
houses
near
the
next
bungalow
beyond
being
about
half
a
mile
away
with
a
sigh
of
relief
leslie
deposited
the
driftwood
in
one
corner
of
the
veranda
of
the
nearest
bungalow
then
she
dropped
into
one
of
the
willow
rockers
to
rest
the
dog
panting
at
her
feet
presently
the
screen
door
opened
and
a
lady
stepped
out
oh
are
you
here
leslie
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
and
then
it
was
so
quiet
that
i
came
out
to
see
what
it
meant
every
little
noise
seems
to
startle
me
this
afternoon
i
so
sorry
aunt
marcia
i
should
have
called
to
you
said
leslie
starting
up
contritely
to
help
her
aunt
to
a
seat
i
hope
you
had
a
good
nap
and
feel
rested
but
sometimes
i
think
it
would
do
you
more
good
if
you
come
out
with
me
and
sit
by
the
ocean
than
try
to
lie
down
in
your
room
it
was
simply
glorious
miss
marcia
crane
shook
her
head
i
know
what
is
best
for
me
leslie
dear
you
do
always
understand
but
i
believe
this
place
doing
me
a
great
deal
of
good
i
confess
i
thought
crawford
insane
when
he
suggested
it
and
i
came
here
with
the
greatest
reluctance
for
a
nervous
invalid
like
myself
to
go
and
hide
away
in
such
a
forsaken
spot
as
this
is
in
october
just
you
and
i
seemed
to
me
the
wildest
piece
of
folly
but
i
must
say
it
appears
to
be
working
out
all
right
and
i
am
certainly
feeling
better
already
but
why
it
have
been
all
right
argued
leslie
i
was
always
sure
it
would
be
the
doctor
said
this
beach
was
noted
for
its
wonderfully
restful
effect
especially
after
the
summer
crowds
had
left
it
and
that
it
was
far
better
than
a
sanatorium
and
as
for
your
being
alone
with
me
why
i
sixteen
and
a
quite
competent
housekeeper
as
mother
says
and
you
do
need
a
trained
nurse
so
i
can
do
most
everything
for
you
but
your
school
objected
miss
crane
it
was
lovely
of
your
mother
to
allow
you
to
come
with
me
for
i
do
know
another
person
who
would
have
been
so
congenial
or
helpful
but
i
worry
constantly
over
the
time
you
are
losing
from
high
school
well
do
you
worry
another
bit
laughed
leslie
i
told
you
that
my
chum
elsie
is
sending
me
down
all
our
notes
and
i
study
an
hour
or
two
every
morning
and
i
probably
go
right
on
with
my
classes
when
i
go
back
besides
it
the
greatest
lark
in
the
world
for
me
to
be
here
at
the
ocean
at
this
unusual
time
of
the
year
i
never
in
all
my
life
had
an
experience
like
it
and
then
i
did
think
at
first
that
it
could
possibly
be
went
on
her
aunt
we
seem
quite
unprotected
here
we
miles
from
a
railroad
station
and
not
another
inhabited
house
around
what
would
happen
if
again
leslie
laughed
we
a
telephone
in
the
bungalow
and
can
call
up
the
village
doctor
or
the
constable
in
case
of
need
the
doctor
said
there
were
any
tramps
or
unwelcome
characters
about
and
certainly
never
seen
any
in
the
two
weeks
we
been
here
and
last
but
not
least
there
always
rags
you
know
how
extremely
unpleasant
make
it
for
any
one
who
tried
to
harm
us
no
aunt
marcia
you
have
a
ghost
of
an
excuse
for
not
feeling
perfectly
safe
but
now
i
going
in
to
start
supper
you
stay
here
and
enjoy
the
view
but
her
aunt
shivered
and
rose
when
leslie
did
no
i
prefer
to
sit
by
the
open
fire
i
started
it
a
while
ago
and
i
glad
you
brought
some
more
wood
it
was
getting
low
as
they
went
in
together
the
girl
glanced
up
at
the
faded
and
sign
over
the
door
is
it
the
most
appropriate
name
for
this
place
haven
it
is
surely
a
haven
of
rest
to
us
but
i
think
i
like
the
name
of
that
closed
cottage
next
door
even
better
what
is
it
asked
her
aunt
idly
i
never
even
had
the
curiosity
to
look
then
you
must
come
and
see
for
yourself
laughed
leslie
turning
her
aunt
about
and
gently
forcing
her
across
the
veranda
they
ploughed
their
way
across
a
stretch
of
sand
and
stepped
on
the
veranda
of
the
cottage
next
door
it
was
a
bungalow
somewhat
similar
to
their
own
but
plainly
closed
up
for
the
winter
the
windows
had
their
board
shutters
adjusted
the
door
was
padlocked
and
a
small
heap
of
sand
had
drifted
in
on
the
veranda
leslie
pointed
to
the
over
the
door
there
it
is
nest
there
something
about
the
name
that
fascinates
me
do
you
feel
so
too
aunt
marcia
i
can
imagine
all
sorts
of
curious
and
wonderful
things
about
a
house
called
nest
it
just
fairly
bristles
with
possibilities
what
a
romantic
child
you
are
leslie
smiled
her
aunt
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
you
find
you
wo
be
thinking
of
interesting
possibilities
in
a
perfectly
ordinary
summer
bungalow
it
a
pretty
enough
name
of
course
but
i
must
confess
it
does
suggest
a
single
thing
to
me
except
that
i
cold
and
want
to
get
back
to
the
fire
come
along
dearie
leslie
sighed
and
turned
back
without
another
word
to
lead
her
aunt
to
their
own
abode
one
phase
of
their
stay
she
had
been
very
very
careful
to
conceal
from
miss
marcia
she
loved
this
aunt
devotedly
all
the
more
perhaps
because
she
was
ill
and
weak
and
nervous
and
very
dependent
on
her
niece
care
but
down
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
leslie
had
to
confess
to
herself
that
she
was
lonely
horribly
lonely
for
the
companionship
of
her
parents
and
sisters
and
school
chums
the
loneliness
did
not
always
bother
her
but
it
came
over
her
at
times
like
an
overwhelming
wave
usually
when
miss
marcia
failed
to
respond
to
some
whim
or
project
or
bubbling
enthusiasm
between
them
gaped
the
abyss
of
forty
years
difference
in
age
and
more
than
a
score
of
times
leslie
had
yearned
for
some
one
of
her
own
years
to
share
the
joy
she
felt
in
her
unusual
surroundings
as
they
stepped
on
their
own
veranda
leslie
glanced
out
to
sea
with
a
start
of
surprise
why
look
how
it
clouding
up
she
exclaimed
it
was
as
clear
as
a
bell
a
few
minutes
ago
and
now
the
blue
sky
is
disappearing
rapidly
i
knew
was
a
averred
miss
marcia
i
felt
in
my
bones
that
a
storm
was
coming
we
probably
get
it
i
do
hope
the
roof
wo
leak
we
have
had
a
real
bad
storm
since
we
came
and
i
dread
the
experience
at
eight
that
evening
it
became
apparent
that
they
were
in
for
a
wild
night
the
wind
had
whipped
around
to
the
northeast
and
was
blowing
a
gale
there
was
a
persistent
crash
of
breakers
on
the
beach
to
open
a
door
or
window
was
to
admit
a
small
cyclone
of
wind
and
sand
and
rain
miss
marcia
sat
for
a
while
over
the
open
fire
bemoaning
the
fact
that
the
roof
leak
in
spots
though
fortunately
not
over
the
beds
she
was
depressed
and
nervous
and
finally
declared
she
would
go
to
bed
but
leslie
far
from
being
nervous
was
wildly
excited
and
exhilarated
by
the
conflict
of
the
elements
when
her
aunt
had
finally
retired
she
hurried
on
a
big
mackinaw
and
cap
and
slipped
out
to
the
veranda
to
enjoy
it
better
rags
whimpering
followed
her
there
was
not
much
to
see
for
the
night
was
pitch
black
but
she
enjoyed
the
feel
of
the
wind
and
rain
in
her
face
and
the
little
occasional
dashes
of
sand
wet
through
at
last
but
happy
she
crept
noiselessly
indoors
and
went
to
her
own
room
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
big
from
her
aunt
i
glad
aunt
marcia
is
on
the
other
side
she
thought
it
quieter
there
on
the
south
and
west
i
get
the
full
force
of
things
here
it
would
only
worry
her
but
i
like
it
how
lonesome
curlew
nest
seems
on
a
wild
night
like
this
she
switched
off
her
electric
light
raised
her
shade
and
looked
over
at
the
empty
bungalow
rags
who
always
slept
in
her
room
jumped
up
on
the
beside
her
the
mingled
sand
and
rain
on
the
window
prevented
her
from
seeing
anything
clearly
so
she
slipped
the
sash
quietly
open
and
heedless
for
a
moment
of
the
drenching
inrush
stood
gazing
out
only
the
wall
of
the
house
twenty
feet
away
was
visible
with
two
or
three
windows
all
tightly
shuttered
a
deserted
and
lonely
sight
she
was
just
about
to
close
her
window
when
a
curious
thing
happened
the
dog
beside
her
uttered
a
rumbling
growl
and
moved
restlessly
what
is
it
rags
she
whispered
do
you
see
or
hear
anything
i
sure
there
no
one
around
the
dog
grumbled
again
half
audibly
and
the
hair
along
his
spine
lifted
a
little
hush
rags
for
gracious
sake
do
let
aunt
marcia
hear
you
whatever
happens
it
would
upset
her
terribly
breathed
leslie
distractedly
the
dog
obediently
lay
quiet
but
he
continued
to
tremble
with
some
obscure
excitement
and
leslie
remained
stock
still
gazing
at
the
empty
house
at
length
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
unusual
she
was
about
to
close
the
window
and
turn
away
when
something
caused
her
to
lean
out
regardless
of
the
rain
and
stare
fixedly
at
a
window
in
the
opposite
wall
was
she
mistaken
did
her
eyes
deceive
her
was
it
possibly
some
freak
of
the
darkness
or
the
storm
it
had
been
only
for
an
instant
and
it
did
not
happen
again
but
in
that
instant
she
was
almost
certain
that
she
had
seen
a
faint
streak
of
light
from
a
crack
at
the
side
of
one
of
the
heavily
shuttered
windows
chapter
ii
found
on
the
beach
the
next
morning
dawned
windy
and
wet
a
heavy
northeast
gale
had
whipped
the
sea
into
gray
mountainous
waves
a
fine
drizzle
beat
in
one
face
through
the
slightest
opening
of
door
or
window
leslie
loved
the
soft
salt
tang
of
the
air
and
in
spite
of
her
aunt
rather
horrified
protests
prepared
for
a
long
excursion
out
of
doors
do
worry
about
me
auntie
dear
she
laughed
gaily
one
possibly
catch
cold
in
this
mild
beautiful
air
and
if
i
get
wet
i
can
always
get
dry
again
before
any
damage
is
done
besides
we
need
some
more
wood
for
the
fires
very
very
badly
and
they
say
you
can
simply
find
heaps
of
it
on
the
beach
after
a
storm
like
this
i
want
some
nice
fat
logs
for
our
open
fire
and
i
see
at
least
a
half
dozen
right
down
in
front
of
this
house
and
last
but
not
least
rags
needs
some
exercise
she
found
a
wealth
of
driftwood
at
the
water
edge
that
surpassed
her
wildest
dreams
again
and
again
she
filled
her
basket
and
hauled
it
up
to
the
bungalow
and
three
times
she
carried
up
a
large
log
balanced
on
her
shoulder
but
when
the
supply
at
last
appeared
ample
she
returned
to
the
beach
on
another
quest
rather
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
the
stormy
ocean
had
cast
up
many
things
beside
driftwood
articles
that
in
size
and
variety
suggested
that
there
must
have
been
a
wreck
in
the
night
yet
she
knew
that
there
had
been
no
wreck
else
the
station
less
than
a
mile
away
would
have
been
very
busy
and
she
herself
must
surely
have
heard
some
of
the
disturbance
no
there
had
been
no
wreck
yet
all
about
her
lay
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
many
past
disasters
a
broken
mast
stump
was
imbedded
upright
in
the
sand
at
one
spot
in
another
a
pair
of
stairs
suggesting
a
companionway
lay
half
out
of
the
water
sundry
casks
and
barrels
dotted
the
beach
some
empty
some
still
untouched
rusty
tins
of
canned
goods
oil
and
paint
often
intact
intermingled
with
the
debris
bottles
either
empty
or
full
of
every
conceivable
liquid
added
to
the
list
and
sprinkled
through
and
around
all
the
rest
were
broken
dishes
combs
and
other
household
and
personal
articles
in
surprising
quantities
leslie
roamed
about
among
this
varied
collection
the
salt
spray
in
her
face
the
surging
breakers
sometimes
unexpectedly
curling
around
her
rubber
boots
there
was
a
new
and
wonderful
fascination
to
her
in
examining
this
ancient
wreckage
speculating
on
the
contents
of
unopened
tins
and
searching
ever
farther
and
farther
along
the
shore
for
possible
of
even
greater
interest
or
value
why
i
find
a
chest
of
jewels
or
a
barrel
full
of
golden
coins
or
a
crammed
with
bills
rags
she
demanded
whimsically
of
the
jubilant
dog
i
sure
something
of
that
kind
must
go
down
with
every
ship
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
this
stuff
and
why
should
we
be
lucky
enough
to
find
it
but
rags
was
busy
investigating
the
contents
of
some
tin
and
had
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
respond
his
own
particular
quests
being
quite
in
another
line
and
far
more
interesting
to
him
so
leslie
continued
on
her
own
way
absorbed
in
her
own
investigations
and
thoughts
the
affair
of
the
previous
night
was
still
occupying
a
large
place
in
her
mind
nothing
further
had
occurred
though
she
had
watched
at
her
window
for
nearly
an
hour
even
rags
at
length
ceased
to
exhibit
signs
of
uneasiness
and
she
had
gone
to
bed
at
last
feeling
that
she
must
have
been
mistaken
in
imagining
anything
unusual
the
first
thing
she
had
done
this
morning
after
leaving
the
house
was
to
walk
around
curlew
nest
examining
it
carefully
for
any
sign
of
occupation
it
was
closed
and
shuttered
as
tight
as
a
drum
and
she
could
discern
no
slightest
sign
of
a
human
being
having
been
near
it
for
days
but
still
she
could
not
rid
her
mind
of
the
impression
that
there
had
been
last
night
out
of
the
ordinary
or
rags
would
not
have
behaved
as
he
did
he
was
not
the
kind
of
dog
that
unnecessarily
excited
himself
about
nothing
it
was
a
little
bit
strange
oh
dear
i
beg
your
pardon
i
awfully
sorry
exclaimed
leslie
reeling
backward
from
the
shock
of
collision
with
some
one
she
had
unseeingly
bumped
into
as
she
plowed
her
way
along
her
head
bent
to
the
wind
her
eyes
only
on
the
beach
at
her
feet
the
person
with
whom
she
had
collided
also
recovered
a
lost
balance
and
turned
to
looked
at
her
leslie
beheld
a
figure
slightly
taller
than
herself
clothed
in
yellow
slickers
and
long
rubber
boots
a
pulled
closely
over
plump
rosy
cheeks
and
big
inquiring
blue
eyes
for
a
moment
she
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
tell
whether
the
figure
was
man
or
woman
boy
or
girl
then
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
tore
the
aside
and
a
long
brown
curl
escaped
and
whipped
into
the
blue
eyes
it
was
a
girl
very
little
older
than
leslie
herself
do
mention
it
laughed
the
girl
i
did
know
there
was
another
soul
on
the
beach
beside
father
and
ted
and
myself
and
then
for
the
first
time
leslie
noticed
two
other
figures
standing
just
beyond
each
clad
similarly
to
the
girl
and
each
with
in
hand
and
a
long
line
running
out
into
the
boiling
surf
the
girl
too
held
a
rod
in
her
hand
you
just
spoiled
the
loveliest
bite
i
had
this
morning
the
girl
laughed
again
but
i
forgive
you
if
you
tell
me
who
you
are
and
how
you
come
to
be
out
here
in
this
bad
weather
it
quite
unusual
to
see
any
one
on
the
beach
at
this
season
i
leslie
crane
and
i
staying
at
rest
haven
with
my
aunt
miss
crane
who
is
not
well
and
is
trying
to
recuperate
here
according
to
the
doctor
orders
responded
leslie
feeling
somewhat
like
an
information
bureau
as
she
said
it
oh
so
you
staying
here
are
you
how
jolly
i
never
met
any
one
staying
here
at
this
season
before
i
phyllis
kelvin
and
this
is
my
father
and
my
brother
ted
father
miss
leslie
crane
ted
she
made
the
introductions
at
the
top
of
her
voice
as
the
wind
and
roar
of
the
ocean
almost
drowned
it
and
each
of
the
two
figures
responded
politely
keeping
one
eye
all
the
while
on
his
line
we
always
come
down
here
for
three
weeks
in
october
father
and
ted
and
i
for
the
fishing
phyllis
went
on
to
explain
father
adores
fishing
and
always
takes
his
vacation
late
down
here
so
that
he
can
have
the
fishing
in
peace
and
at
its
best
and
ted
and
i
come
to
keep
him
company
and
keep
house
for
him
incidentally
that
our
bungalow
right
back
there
luck
oh
i
so
glad
you
going
to
be
here
sighed
leslie
happily
been
horribly
lonesome
aunt
marcia
does
not
go
out
very
often
and
sleeps
a
great
deal
and
i
absolutely
to
talk
to
some
one
at
times
i
do
know
anything
much
about
fishing
but
i
hope
you
let
me
be
with
you
some
if
i
promise
not
to
talk
too
much
and
spoil
things
you
not
a
bit
happier
to
find
some
one
than
am
echoed
phyllis
i
love
fishing
too
but
i
not
so
crazy
about
it
as
they
are
and
often
longed
for
some
girl
chum
down
here
we
going
to
be
the
best
of
friends
i
know
and
i
call
on
you
and
your
aunt
this
very
afternoon
if
you
come
up
to
our
bungalow
now
with
me
and
help
carry
this
basket
of
driftwood
daddy
and
ted
wo
move
from
the
beach
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
but
i
like
to
stop
and
talk
with
you
i
get
tired
sooner
than
they
do
leslie
agreed
joyfully
and
together
they
tugged
a
heavy
basket
of
wood
up
to
the
one
other
bungalow
on
the
beach
beside
the
one
leslie
and
her
aunt
were
stopping
at
and
curlew
nest
she
found
fisherman
luck
a
delightful
abode
full
of
the
pleasant
intimate
touches
that
could
only
be
imparted
by
owners
who
inhabited
it
themselves
most
of
the
time
a
roaring
fire
blazed
invitingly
in
the
big
open
fireplace
in
the
come
take
off
your
things
and
stay
awhile
urged
phyllis
and
leslie
removed
her
mackinaw
and
cap
the
two
girls
sank
down
in
big
easy
chairs
before
the
fire
and
laughingly
agreeing
to
drop
formality
proceeded
as
phyllis
and
leslie
to
exchange
confidences
in
true
girl
fashion
i
must
stay
long
remarked
leslie
aunt
marcia
will
be
missing
me
and
i
must
go
back
to
see
about
lunch
but
what
a
delightful
bungalow
you
have
are
you
here
much
of
the
time
we
here
a
good
deal
in
the
off
seasons
april
to
june
and
september
through
november
father
ted
and
i
but
we
do
care
for
it
so
much
in
the
summer
season
when
the
beach
is
more
crowded
with
vacation
folks
and
that
big
hotel
farther
up
the
beach
is
full
we
have
some
cousins
who
usually
take
the
bungalow
for
july
and
august
i
never
was
at
the
ocean
in
october
before
sighed
leslie
comfortably
and
it
perfectly
heavenly
we
have
that
dear
little
bungalow
rest
haven
but
the
one
right
next
to
it
is
not
occupied
no
said
phyllis
and
it
queer
too
i
never
knew
either
of
them
to
be
occupied
at
this
season
before
they
are
both
owned
by
the
danforths
and
they
usually
shut
them
both
up
on
september
and
refuse
to
open
them
till
the
beginning
of
the
next
season
how
did
you
come
to
get
one
of
them
may
i
ask
oh
i
think
aunt
marcia
doctor
managed
it
he
happened
to
know
the
danforths
personally
and
got
them
to
break
their
rule
as
a
great
favor
to
him
we
appreciate
it
very
much
but
do
you
know
and
here
leslie
unconsciously
sank
her
voice
i
saw
such
a
queer
thing
about
that
other
bungalow
late
yesterday
evening
and
she
recounted
to
her
new
friend
a
history
of
the
previous
night
experience
oh
how
perfectly
gorgeous
sighed
phyllis
thrilled
beyond
description
by
the
narrative
do
you
suppose
it
i
heard
of
haunted
houses
but
never
of
a
haunted
now
do
laugh
at
me
what
ted
and
father
do
when
i
speak
of
such
things
for
leslie
could
not
repress
a
giggle
at
this
suggestion
phyllis
you
there
are
no
such
things
as
haunted
houses
really
she
remonstrated
well
i
not
so
sure
of
it
and
anyway
i
always
to
come
across
one
and
what
other
explanation
can
there
be
for
this
thing
anyway
but
do
me
one
favor
wo
you
leslie
let
keep
this
thing
to
ourselves
and
do
a
little
investigating
on
our
own
account
if
i
tell
father
and
ted
and
let
them
know
what
i
think
they
simply
hoot
at
me
and
go
and
spoil
it
all
by
breaking
the
place
open
and
tramping
around
it
themselves
and
scaring
away
any
possible
ghost
there
might
be
let
just
see
if
we
can
make
anything
out
of
it
ourselves
will
you
why
of
course
i
will
agreed
leslie
heartily
i
would
dare
to
let
aunt
marcia
know
there
was
anything
queer
about
the
place
she
be
scared
to
death
and
it
would
upset
all
the
doctor
plans
for
her
i
do
believe
in
the
ghost
theory
but
i
think
there
may
have
been
something
mysterious
about
it
and
it
will
be
no
end
of
a
lark
to
track
it
down
if
we
can
but
i
must
be
going
now
i
coming
with
you
announced
the
impetuous
phyllis
i
want
to
go
up
there
right
away
and
do
a
little
looking
about
myself
i
simply
wait
so
they
set
off
together
trudging
through
the
sand
at
the
edge
of
the
ocean
where
the
walking
was
easiest
all
the
way
leslie
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
rags
it
was
not
often
that
he
deserted
her
even
for
five
minutes
but
she
had
not
seen
him
since
her
encounter
with
phyllis
it
was
not
till
their
arrival
at
curlew
nest
that
she
discovered
his
whereabouts
directly
in
front
of
this
bungalow
veranda
and
about
fifty
feet
away
from
it
lay
the
remains
of
a
huge
old
half
buried
in
the
sand
almost
under
this
trunk
only
his
rear
quarters
visible
was
the
form
of
rags
digging
frantically
at
a
great
hole
in
the
wet
sand
so
deep
now
was
the
hole
that
the
dog
was
more
than
half
buried
there
rags
he
after
another
cried
leslie
i
was
wondering
where
he
could
be
they
both
raced
up
to
him
and
reached
him
just
as
he
had
apparently
attained
the
end
of
his
quest
and
backed
out
of
the
hole
why
what
has
he
got
exclaimed
phyllis
that
no
and
in
truth
it
was
not
for
out
of
the
hole
the
dog
was
dragging
a
small
burlap
sack
which
plainly
contained
some
heavy
article
in
its
folds
chapter
iii
the
mysterious
casket
both
girls
dashed
forward
to
snatch
the
dog
from
him
but
rags
had
apparently
made
up
his
mind
that
after
his
arduous
labors
he
was
going
to
have
the
privilege
of
examining
his
find
himself
at
any
rate
he
would
not
be
easily
robbed
seizing
the
burlap
bag
in
his
mouth
he
raced
to
the
water
edge
and
stood
there
guarding
his
treasure
with
mock
fierceness
phyllis
being
a
stranger
he
would
not
even
allow
to
approach
him
but
growled
ominously
if
she
came
within
ten
feet
of
his
vicinity
and
when
rags
growled
it
behooved
the
stranger
to
have
a
care
leslie
he
pretended
to
welcome
but
no
sooner
had
she
approached
near
enough
to
lay
her
hand
on
the
bag
than
he
seized
it
triumphantly
and
raced
up
the
beach
oh
do
grab
him
somehow
cried
phyllis
in
despair
he
drop
the
thing
in
the
water
and
the
next
breaker
will
wash
it
away
and
never
know
what
it
was
leslie
herself
was
no
less
anxious
to
filch
his
treasure
but
rags
had
by
now
acquired
a
decidedly
frolicsome
spirit
and
the
chase
he
led
them
was
long
and
weary
three
times
he
dropped
the
bag
directly
in
the
path
of
a
breaker
and
once
it
was
actually
washed
out
and
the
girls
groaned
in
chorus
as
they
saw
it
flung
into
the
boiling
surf
but
another
wave
washed
it
ashore
only
to
land
it
again
in
the
custody
of
rags
before
leslie
could
seize
it
finally
however
he
wearied
of
the
sport
and
sensing
the
sad
fact
that
his
prize
was
in
no
wise
edible
he
dropped
it
suddenly
to
pursue
an
unsuspecting
the
girls
fell
joyfully
upon
the
treasure
and
bore
it
to
the
veranda
of
curlew
nest
for
further
examination
what
under
the
sun
can
it
be
marveled
the
curious
phyllis
something
heavy
and
all
sewed
up
in
a
coarse
bag
like
that
it
as
good
as
a
ghost
story
let
get
at
it
right
away
they
sat
down
on
the
wet
steps
while
leslie
unrolled
the
bag
not
much
larger
than
a
big
and
tried
to
tear
an
opening
at
the
top
but
her
slender
fingers
were
not
equal
to
the
task
so
phyllis
undertook
it
let
me
try
she
urged
i
play
the
piano
a
great
deal
and
my
fingers
are
very
strong
and
sure
enough
it
did
not
take
her
more
than
a
moment
to
make
an
opening
and
thrust
her
hand
into
it
what
she
found
there
she
drew
out
and
laid
in
leslie
lap
while
the
two
girls
gasped
simultaneously
at
the
singular
object
they
had
discovered
to
begin
with
it
was
encrusted
with
sand
and
corroded
by
the
contact
of
salt
air
and
seawater
but
when
they
had
brushed
off
the
sand
and
polished
it
as
well
as
they
could
with
the
burlap
bag
it
stood
forth
in
something
of
its
original
appearance
a
small
box
or
casket
of
some
heavy
metal
either
bronze
or
copper
completely
covered
with
elaborate
carving
it
was
about
six
inches
long
three
wide
and
two
in
height
it
stood
on
four
legs
and
upon
examination
the
carving
proved
to
be
the
body
of
a
winged
serpent
of
some
kind
completely
encircling
the
box
the
head
projecting
over
the
front
edge
where
the
lock
or
fastening
of
the
cover
would
be
the
legs
of
the
receptacle
were
the
creature
claws
the
carving
was
remarkably
fine
and
delicate
in
workmanship
my
gracious
breathed
phyllis
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
strange
what
can
it
be
and
is
it
beautiful
added
leslie
what
can
that
queer
creature
be
that
carved
on
it
looks
to
me
like
the
pictures
of
dragons
that
we
used
to
have
in
books
that
just
what
it
is
you
hit
it
i
could
think
what
it
was
at
first
it
so
wound
around
the
box
cried
phyllis
but
this
thing
is
certainly
a
box
of
some
kind
and
there
must
be
some
opening
to
it
and
probably
something
in
it
let
try
now
to
get
it
open
but
that
was
easier
said
than
done
try
as
they
would
they
could
find
no
way
of
opening
the
casket
the
dragon
head
came
down
over
the
lock
or
clasp
and
there
was
no
vestige
of
keyhole
or
catch
or
spring
and
so
intricate
was
the
carving
that
there
was
not
even
any
crack
or
crevice
where
the
lid
fitted
down
over
the
body
of
the
box
into
which
they
could
insert
phyllis
penknife
blade
to
pry
it
open
by
force
the
casket
and
its
contents
was
a
baffling
mystery
and
the
wicked
looking
little
dragon
seemed
to
guard
the
secret
with
positive
glee
so
malicious
was
its
expression
phyllis
at
last
threw
down
her
knife
in
disgust
and
rattled
the
box
impatiently
something
bumps
around
in
there
she
declared
i
can
hear
it
distinctly
but
i
do
believe
we
ever
be
able
to
get
at
it
i
never
saw
such
a
queer
affair
let
try
to
break
it
with
an
ax
have
you
one
oh
do
do
cried
leslie
horrified
it
would
surely
spoil
this
beautiful
box
and
might
even
injure
what
in
it
there
must
be
other
way
of
getting
it
open
if
only
we
take
our
time
and
go
at
it
carefully
they
both
sat
for
several
moments
regarding
their
find
with
resentful
curiosity
suddenly
leslie
thoughts
took
a
new
tack
how
in
the
world
did
it
ever
come
there
buried
in
the
sand
like
that
thrown
up
on
the
beach
by
the
waves
of
course
declared
phyllis
positively
no
doubt
from
some
wreck
and
buried
in
the
sand
after
a
while
just
naturally
as
lots
of
things
are
the
explanation
was
a
very
probable
one
but
it
rather
far
from
the
water
edge
objected
leslie
oh
no
indeed
why
in
winter
the
surf
often
comes
up
right
under
the
bungalows
remarked
phyllis
in
quite
an
offhanded
way
mercy
do
ever
tell
aunt
marcia
that
or
she
go
straight
home
exclaimed
leslie
but
is
it
queer
that
it
just
happened
to
be
right
in
front
of
curlew
nest
everything
queer
seems
to
happen
right
around
that
place
that
so
i
almost
forgotten
the
other
thing
but
what
understand
is
how
your
dog
happened
to
dig
the
thing
up
oh
that
simple
he
always
chasing
it
a
great
sport
of
his
and
i
suppose
it
just
happened
that
one
dug
itself
down
in
the
sand
right
here
and
he
dug
after
it
and
then
came
across
this
phyllis
had
a
sudden
brilliant
idea
let
go
and
examine
the
hole
perhaps
there
something
else
in
it
they
both
raced
over
to
the
stump
and
leslie
thrust
her
hand
into
the
hole
there
nothing
else
in
there
she
averred
but
perhaps
it
might
be
worth
while
to
dig
around
here
and
see
if
there
might
be
some
other
article
buried
near
it
i
get
a
shovel
she
disappeared
behind
her
own
bungalow
for
a
moment
and
returned
with
a
shovel
they
dug
furiously
for
ten
minutes
and
turned
up
the
sand
all
about
the
original
hole
nothing
of
the
slightest
interest
came
to
light
however
and
they
presently
abandoned
the
attempt
and
filled
in
the
hole
again
this
is
all
there
was
that
plain
declared
phyllis
and
all
we
can
think
is
that
it
was
cast
up
from
some
wreck
and
got
buried
here
but
leslie
had
been
thinking
has
it
occurred
to
you
phyllis
that
it
have
something
to
do
with
curlew
nest
and
the
queer
thing
that
happened
here
i
wonder
how
long
it
has
been
lying
in
that
hole
they
examined
the
find
again
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
said
phyllis
if
it
had
been
in
that
sand
a
time
i
think
it
would
look
rather
different
to
begin
with
the
burlap
bag
is
in
very
good
condition
whole
and
strong
it
would
take
long
in
there
for
it
to
become
ragged
and
go
to
pieces
and
besides
that
the
box
would
look
different
you
know
that
metal
like
this
gets
badly
corroded
and
tarnished
in
a
very
little
while
when
it
exposed
even
to
this
salt
air
not
to
speak
of
the
water
too
i
know
because
we
have
some
copper
trays
at
the
bungalow
and
they
always
a
i
have
to
keep
polishing
and
polishing
them
to
make
them
look
nice
now
this
box
is
very
little
tarnished
since
we
rubbed
it
up
it
makes
me
sure
it
has
been
buried
long
well
has
there
been
a
wreck
then
very
lately
demanded
leslie
not
since
last
july
and
that
was
only
a
fishing
schooner
no
chance
in
the
world
that
such
as
would
be
aboard
of
her
then
as
far
as
i
can
see
this
box
must
have
been
buried
here
deliberately
and
very
recently
too
declared
leslie
solemnly
can
you
think
of
any
other
explanation
leslie
could
it
have
been
done
last
night
demanded
phyllis
in
an
awed
whisper
oh
i
never
thought
of
that
perhaps
it
was
perhaps
that
was
the
meaning
of
the
light
and
all
phyllis
there
some
queer
mystery
here
i
wonder
if
we
ought
to
tell
folks
about
it
oh
implored
phyllis
not
for
a
while
at
least
it
would
be
so
wonderful
to
have
this
as
a
secret
of
our
own
and
see
what
we
can
make
of
it
just
suppose
we
could
work
it
out
for
ourselves
well
it
be
a
lark
and
i
only
hope
it
all
right
but
going
to
ask
you
one
favor
phyllis
please
take
the
little
box
and
keep
it
at
your
house
for
i
do
want
aunt
marcia
to
be
worried
about
the
matter
and
she
might
come
across
it
if
i
kept
it
here
and
i
must
be
going
in
now
or
she
be
worried
and
she
thrust
the
box
into
phyllis
hand
indeed
i
keep
it
gladly
and
hide
it
safely
too
this
is
one
secret
i
wo
have
ted
meddling
in
declared
phyllis
let
call
the
box
dragon
secret
he
seems
to
be
guarding
very
successfully
i
come
back
this
afternoon
and
call
and
we
can
talk
this
over
some
more
and
she
turned
away
toward
the
direction
of
her
own
bungalow
with
the
dragon
secret
carefully
concealed
beneath
her
rainproof
coat
chapter
iv
in
the
sand
the
northeaster
lasted
three
days
then
it
blew
itself
out
the
wind
shifted
to
the
northwest
and
there
was
beautiful
sparkling
weather
for
the
rest
of
the
week
during
this
time
the
two
new
friends
came
to
know
each
other
very
well
indeed
it
was
not
only
their
little
shared
mystery
that
united
them
they
found
they
had
congenial
tastes
and
interests
in
very
many
directions
although
they
were
so
different
in
temperament
leslie
was
slight
and
dark
in
appearance
rather
timid
in
disposition
and
inclined
to
be
shy
and
hesitant
in
manner
phyllis
was
quite
the
opposite
large
and
plump
and
rosy
courageous
and
independent
jolly
and
often
headlong
and
thoughtless
in
action
her
mother
had
died
when
she
was
very
little
and
she
had
grown
up
mainly
in
the
care
of
nurses
and
servants
from
whom
she
had
imbibed
some
very
queer
notions
as
leslie
was
not
long
in
discovering
one
of
these
was
her
firm
belief
in
ghosts
and
haunted
houses
which
not
even
the
robust
and
wholesome
contempt
of
her
father
and
older
brother
ted
had
succeeded
in
changing
but
phyllis
had
a
special
gift
which
drew
the
two
girls
together
with
a
strong
attraction
she
was
a
devoted
lover
of
music
and
so
accomplished
a
pianist
as
to
be
almost
a
genius
for
one
of
her
age
the
whole
family
seemed
to
be
musical
her
father
played
the
and
ted
the
violin
but
phyllis
work
at
the
piano
far
surpassed
theirs
and
leslie
too
loved
music
devotedly
though
she
neither
sang
nor
played
any
instrument
it
was
a
revelation
to
her
when
on
the
next
rainy
afternoon
she
accompanied
phyllis
to
the
of
fisherman
luck
and
listened
to
a
recital
such
as
she
had
never
expected
to
hear
outside
of
a
oh
phyllis
it
wonderful
simply
wonderful
she
sighed
blissfully
when
the
last
liquid
ripples
of
a
chopin
waltz
had
died
away
i
see
how
you
ever
learned
to
play
like
that
but
what
in
the
world
are
you
going
to
do
now
for
phyllis
had
jumped
up
with
an
impatient
exclamation
laid
back
the
cover
of
the
grand
piano
and
was
hunting
frantically
in
the
music
cabinet
for
something
why
i
going
to
tune
the
old
thing
she
declared
this
salt
air
is
enough
to
wreck
any
piano
and
this
one
is
so
old
that
it
below
pitch
most
of
the
time
but
of
course
it
would
do
to
have
a
very
good
one
here
that
why
dad
sent
this
one
down
i
just
to
learn
to
tune
it
in
or
we
could
never
have
used
it
so
here
goes
and
to
leslie
breathless
amazement
she
proceeded
to
tune
the
instrument
with
the
most
professional
air
in
the
world
phyllis
you
amazing
murmured
leslie
at
length
but
tell
me
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
this
wonderful
gift
you
have
surely
you
make
it
your
career
or
something
like
that
well
of
course
i
to
confided
her
friend
to
be
candid
crazy
to
it
about
the
only
thing
i
think
of
but
father
wo
hear
of
it
he
says
he
will
let
me
have
all
the
advantages
he
can
for
an
amateur
but
that
all
he
willing
or
can
afford
to
do
of
course
only
seventeen
and
i
got
to
finish
high
school
at
least
but
i
wild
to
go
afterward
to
some
one
of
the
great
european
teachers
and
study
for
a
year
or
two
and
then
see
what
happens
that
however
would
cost
at
least
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
and
father
says
he
simply
afford
it
so
there
you
are
it
awful
to
have
an
ambition
and
no
way
of
encouraging
it
but
i
always
hoping
that
something
will
turn
up
and
phyllis
returned
to
her
tuning
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
would
be
a
pretty
handy
sum
to
have
laughed
leslie
i
been
rather
on
the
lookout
for
some
such
amount
myself
but
for
a
somewhat
different
reason
oh
i
warrant
you
have
an
ambition
too
now
tell
me
about
it
cried
phyllis
pouncing
on
her
and
ignoring
the
piano
yes
it
is
an
ambition
acknowledged
leslie
but
it
is
a
bit
like
you
i
hardly
think
you
could
call
it
an
ambition
just
a
you
see
it
this
way
we
rather
a
big
family
at
home
four
of
us
children
and
i
the
oldest
and
father
rather
delicate
and
has
never
been
able
to
hold
a
good
position
long
because
he
out
so
much
with
illness
we
get
along
fairly
well
all
but
little
ralph
he
my
special
pet
four
year
old
but
he
lame
had
some
hip
trouble
ever
since
he
was
a
baby
he
could
be
cured
the
doctors
say
by
a
very
expensive
operation
and
some
special
care
but
we
have
the
money
for
it
just
yet
always
hoping
something
will
turn
up
too
and
my
plan
is
to
hurry
through
high
school
and
and
then
teach
and
save
every
spare
penny
for
ralph
but
it
seems
an
awfully
long
time
to
wait
and
all
the
while
that
little
tot
is
getting
any
better
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
reached
this
point
and
the
impetuous
phyllis
hugged
her
you
darling
thing
i
think
you
too
unselfish
for
words
it
makes
me
feel
ashamed
of
my
own
selfish
foolish
little
wish
would
it
be
gorgeous
if
we
could
find
four
or
five
thousand
dollars
lying
around
on
the
beach
would
it
just
she
stopped
abruptly
what
the
matter
inquired
leslie
anything
wrong
no
something
just
occurred
to
me
what
if
that
wretched
little
dragon
of
ours
was
guarding
just
such
a
fortune
it
might
be
jewels
or
or
or
equally
valuable
i
going
to
get
it
right
away
and
make
another
try
at
opening
it
it
makes
me
furious
every
time
i
think
of
it
to
be
so
so
balked
about
getting
at
anything
but
phyllis
objected
leslie
even
if
there
any
such
thing
i
do
believe
we
have
a
right
to
keep
it
it
must
belong
to
and
we
ought
to
make
an
effort
to
find
out
who
do
you
think
so
oh
yes
if
it
any
person
i
suppose
so
admitted
phyllis
but
what
if
she
stopped
significantly
now
tell
me
it
was
hidden
there
by
and
infectious
laugh
pealed
out
oh
hush
or
ted
will
hear
he
ca
be
far
away
implored
phyllis
guiltily
of
course
i
do
say
what
or
whom
it
was
hidden
by
but
there
something
mighty
queer
to
me
about
an
empty
bungalow
being
inhabited
by
what
about
burglars
interrupted
leslie
quickly
never
such
a
thing
around
these
parts
in
any
one
experience
phyllis
hastened
to
assure
her
much
to
her
secret
relief
then
perhaps
it
the
people
who
own
the
cottage
offered
leslie
no
chance
they
all
gone
off
to
spend
the
winter
in
california
every
one
ted
had
a
letter
from
leroy
danforth
who
is
a
great
chum
of
his
last
week
well
i
there
is
some
other
explanation
besides
a
a
ghostly
one
declared
leslie
nothing
daunted
but
anyway
we
might
have
another
look
at
the
dragon
phyllis
went
and
got
it
out
from
its
in
her
trunk
and
they
spent
a
fruitless
wrestling
with
its
secret
fastening
they
broke
their
trying
to
pry
it
open
they
pressed
and
poked
every
inch
of
it
in
an
endeavor
to
find
a
possible
secret
spring
they
rattled
and
shook
it
rewarded
in
this
case
by
the
dull
thud
of
something
shifting
about
it
was
this
last
sound
only
that
kept
up
their
courage
finally
they
gave
it
up
i
believe
we
could
break
it
open
with
an
ax
perhaps
but
you
do
seem
to
approve
of
that
so
how
we
ever
going
to
find
out
i
sure
i
imagine
declared
phyllis
discouraged
do
you
know
i
think
this
metal
is
so
strong
it
would
resist
even
an
ax
leslie
soothed
her
and
we
only
damage
the
box
without
accomplishing
anything
there
must
be
some
other
way
why
not
show
it
to
ted
and
your
father
perhaps
they
could
do
what
we
ca
i
will
share
this
secret
with
ted
declared
phyllis
obstinately
he
nearly
nineteen
and
he
thinks
he
the
most
important
thing
in
creation
and
he
perfectly
insufferable
in
some
ways
now
to
have
his
advice
asked
in
this
thing
would
set
him
up
worse
than
ever
i
wo
do
it
leslie
had
to
smile
inwardly
at
this
outburst
to
her
ted
had
seemed
just
a
jolly
agreeable
and
rather
companionable
boy
with
a
very
friendly
likable
attitude
but
she
realized
that
she
had
not
had
phyllis
sisterly
experience
so
she
said
nothing
more
they
put
the
dragon
back
in
his
and
sadly
admitted
themselves
more
baffled
than
ever
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
this
however
a
strange
thing
happened
to
the
surprise
of
leslie
miss
marcia
had
been
induced
to
walk
along
the
beach
after
supper
and
stop
in
at
fisherman
luck
to
hear
a
concert
an
impromptu
one
given
by
phyllis
and
her
father
and
brother
leslie
had
learned
that
the
kelvin
family
amused
itself
in
this
fashion
every
night
when
the
fishing
was
not
particularly
good
i
love
to
hear
them
play
should
you
aunt
marcia
phyllis
is
a
wonder
just
by
herself
and
they
must
make
a
delightful
trio
she
said
this
without
any
hope
that
her
aunt
would
express
much
interest
but
to
her
astonishment
miss
marcia
replied
well
suppose
we
walk
down
there
after
tea
i
feeling
so
much
better
that
i
do
believe
it
would
hurt
me
and
i
just
hungry
to
hear
some
music
myself
leslie
joyfully
imparted
the
news
to
phyllis
and
they
planned
an
elaborate
program
it
was
an
evening
that
they
long
remembered
so
absorbed
were
they
in
the
music
that
they
all
loved
and
it
was
not
till
the
end
of
an
ensemble
rendering
of
a
bach
concerto
that
some
one
remarked
why
it
raining
no
one
had
noticed
it
until
then
miss
marcia
was
quite
aghast
for
she
seldom
ventured
out
in
the
rain
and
she
had
brought
no
adequate
wraps
but
leslie
settled
that
question
speedily
i
take
rags
and
run
up
the
beach
to
our
bungalow
and
bring
them
to
you
if
phyllis
will
lend
me
her
slickers
she
declared
no
you
must
come
with
me
ted
i
be
perfectly
safe
with
rags
and
while
i
gone
you
can
all
be
giving
that
beethoven
sonata
that
you
promised
aunt
marcia
i
wo
be
fifteen
minutes
they
finally
let
her
go
and
settled
down
to
the
music
once
more
she
was
much
more
than
fifteen
minutes
in
returning
but
no
one
noticed
it
so
deeply
immersed
were
they
in
the
rendering
of
the
sonata
at
last
however
she
was
back
breathless
and
dripping
and
with
a
curious
light
in
her
eye
that
no
one
noticed
but
phyllis
what
is
it
phyllis
managed
to
whisper
when
the
others
were
talking
and
putting
on
wraps
just
this
replied
leslie
breathlessly
and
jerkily
while
i
was
in
the
house
i
happened
to
look
out
of
my
window
as
i
often
do
no
light
in
my
room
and
i
saw
that
light
again
next
door
rags
saw
it
too
at
least
he
growled
in
that
queer
way
i
waited
and
watched
a
long
time
i
wanted
to
go
out
nearer
the
place
but
did
dare
then
it
disappeared
and
i
did
see
it
any
more
then
i
came
on
here
phyllis
listened
to
the
whispered
jerky
sentences
in
a
thrilled
silence
then
she
replied
i
coming
up
first
thing
morning
early
but
watch
out
the
rest
of
the
night
if
you
can
phyllis
was
as
good
as
her
word
better
in
fact
for
she
was
actually
knocking
at
the
door
of
rest
haven
before
leslie
was
out
of
bed
much
to
miss
marcia
astonishment
did
you
see
anything
else
was
her
first
whispered
greeting
but
leslie
shook
her
head
there
was
another
thing
happened
i
watched
nearly
all
night
till
i
fell
asleep
at
the
window
in
fact
well
something
happened
at
time
or
other
replied
phyllis
provocatively
how
do
you
know
demanded
leslie
in
a
twitter
i
seen
the
sign
of
it
come
outside
and
i
show
you
they
made
some
excuse
to
miss
marcia
for
immediately
vacating
the
house
and
hurried
outdoors
phyllis
led
the
way
to
a
certain
side
door
of
curlew
nest
on
the
opposite
side
from
rest
haven
where
a
sheltering
projection
of
roof
extended
out
for
two
or
three
feet
over
the
ground
the
hard
rain
of
the
night
before
had
beaten
out
the
sand
all
about
the
wooden
to
an
unbroken
smoothness
but
just
under
the
protecting
roof
phyllis
pointed
to
something
at
their
feet
there
it
is
she
muttered
and
leslie
staring
down
beheld
the
impression
of
a
single
footprint
a
footprint
very
different
from
either
of
their
own
in
the
sand
chapter
v
an
exploring
party
well
was
leslie
first
remark
that
proves
thing
beyond
a
doubt
what
demanded
phyllis
that
it
was
a
around
here
i
never
yet
heard
of
a
ghost
who
made
a
footprint
the
deduction
somewhat
staggered
phyllis
in
her
pet
belief
i
suppose
that
true
she
had
to
admit
i
never
did
either
but
now
the
question
is
who
did
it
and
what
did
he
want
but
leslie
had
been
carefully
examining
the
footprint
you
say
what
did
want
have
you
noticed
that
this
footprint
does
look
very
much
like
a
phyllis
stooped
over
it
you
right
it
a
woman
or
a
girl
here
the
deep
imprint
of
the
little
french
heel
and
the
narrow
pointed
toe
must
have
a
mighty
small
foot
she
measured
her
own
beside
it
still
even
mine
would
look
much
smaller
in
pumps
or
slippers
instead
of
these
comfortable
sneakers
might
be
either
a
small
woman
or
a
girl
like
ourselves
but
why
is
there
only
i
wonder
mused
leslie
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
simple
she
walked
on
this
narrow
up
from
the
back
road
probably
because
it
was
easier
or
even
perhaps
so
as
not
to
make
any
footprints
and
just
at
the
doorstep
she
may
have
stumbled
or
stepped
off
by
mistake
in
the
darkness
perhaps
she
did
even
realize
it
again
leslie
had
bent
over
the
footprint
she
was
coming
in
when
she
made
it
do
you
notice
that
it
points
toward
the
door
phyllis
stared
at
her
what
a
perfectly
dandy
detective
you
make
she
exclaimed
you
simply
take
in
everything
you
just
as
good
and
even
better
laughed
leslie
secretly
pleased
however
hurrah
for
us
cried
phyllis
we
just
a
pair
of
natural
now
here
what
i
propose
there
something
mighty
queer
going
on
here
i
believe
and
i
willing
to
give
up
my
ghost
theory
because
it
seem
silly
but
i
want
to
investigate
the
thing
pretty
thoroughly
and
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
to
get
into
that
bungalow
and
see
what
has
been
going
on
inside
but
phyllis
cried
the
shocked
leslie
you
would
break
into
some
one
else
bungalow
would
you
and
besides
how
you
pooh
declared
phyllis
in
scorn
as
if
i
did
know
this
bungalow
as
well
as
our
own
and
the
danforths
almost
as
well
as
my
own
family
too
for
that
matter
i
been
in
here
a
thousand
times
the
danforths
would
be
only
too
grateful
to
me
for
keeping
an
eye
on
their
place
for
them
they
do
the
same
for
us
and
as
for
getting
in
why
i
always
known
a
private
way
of
getting
in
when
everything
locked
up
the
danforths
themselves
showed
me
we
get
in
this
afternoon
this
morning
i
promised
ted
and
father
i
fish
with
them
awhile
but
this
afternoon
free
where
are
you
two
girls
they
heard
miss
crane
calling
from
next
door
and
they
started
guiltily
not
realizing
how
long
they
had
been
away
i
must
be
more
careful
or
aunt
marcia
will
begin
to
suspect
something
and
question
me
whispered
leslie
it
would
never
do
in
the
world
to
have
her
realize
there
was
anything
queer
going
on
so
close
to
us
pack
up
for
home
in
a
minute
her
nerves
are
still
so
uncertain
coming
aunt
marcia
that
so
agreed
phyllis
between
keeping
it
from
your
aunt
and
from
ted
and
father
we
going
to
have
some
tight
squeezes
i
foresee
well
i
be
back
after
luncheon
and
we
do
a
bit
of
investigating
it
was
between
half
past
one
and
two
that
afternoon
when
phyllis
again
appeared
at
rest
haven
a
very
auspicious
time
for
miss
marcia
was
in
her
room
taking
her
usual
long
nap
and
ted
and
his
father
had
gone
a
mile
or
more
down
the
beach
to
an
inlet
to
try
the
fishing
there
the
two
girls
had
the
whole
vicinity
to
themselves
what
shall
we
do
with
rags
questioned
phyllis
i
hardly
think
we
ought
to
take
him
in
ca
you
chain
him
up
oh
i
would
dare
he
howl
himself
sick
and
wake
aunt
marcia
you
see
he
never
chained
but
i
can
turn
him
loose
on
the
beach
and
let
him
chase
and
when
he
well
occupied
we
can
slip
away
they
strolled
down
to
the
water
edge
with
the
dog
who
was
speedily
absorbed
in
the
one
occupation
he
found
of
interest
then
they
slipped
back
to
the
bungalow
without
his
even
noticing
that
they
had
gone
it
was
only
when
they
stood
by
the
side
door
of
curlew
nest
that
leslie
noticed
something
bulky
concealed
under
phyllis
sweater
what
in
the
world
have
you
got
there
she
demanded
phyllis
produced
a
electric
torch
how
do
you
suppose
we
are
going
to
see
anything
in
that
dark
place
without
something
like
this
we
certainly
must
open
any
windows
leslie
confessed
she
had
thought
of
it
and
then
watched
with
amazement
while
phyllis
skilfully
inserted
the
blade
of
a
knife
in
the
crack
of
the
door
wiggled
it
about
a
moment
and
triumphantly
lifted
the
hook
inside
from
its
ring
and
swung
open
the
door
hurry
in
she
whispered
we
must
close
this
quickly
before
any
one
can
notice
they
shut
the
door
in
haste
and
phyllis
flashed
on
her
light
then
she
replaced
the
hook
in
its
ring
now
we
safe
you
see
this
is
a
little
like
a
pantry
where
the
is
kept
they
had
the
door
made
so
that
the
ice
need
not
be
carried
in
through
the
kitchen
but
that
a
very
poor
catch
for
the
door
just
that
little
hook
cried
leslie
i
should
think
they
have
something
more
secure
than
that
i
suppose
it
is
agreed
phyllis
and
they
often
said
so
themselves
and
yet
it
just
one
of
those
things
that
never
gets
changed
anyhow
nobody
ever
locks
anything
down
here
only
fastens
things
up
when
the
season
is
over
there
really
nothing
valuable
enough
here
to
lock
up
or
to
be
attractive
to
thieves
and
so
it
has
just
gone
on
and
i
suppose
that
hook
will
remain
there
forever
but
come
along
let
get
down
to
business
this
way
to
the
and
she
led
the
way
along
a
passage
and
into
the
big
main
room
of
the
bungalow
it
was
very
much
on
the
style
of
that
of
rest
haven
furnished
with
attractive
willow
furniture
and
with
a
large
brick
open
fireplace
at
one
side
as
phyllis
flashed
the
torch
about
in
a
general
survey
leslie
noticed
that
the
cottage
was
obviously
dismantled
for
the
winter
the
furniture
stood
huddled
against
the
walls
there
were
no
dainty
draperies
at
the
shuttered
windows
and
the
rugs
were
rolled
up
tied
and
heaped
in
one
corner
nothing
seems
out
of
the
way
here
said
phyllis
it
just
as
the
danforths
usually
leave
it
now
let
look
into
the
bedrooms
they
journeyed
through
the
four
bedrooms
with
no
different
result
each
wore
the
same
undisturbed
air
of
being
shorn
of
its
summer
drapery
with
beds
starkly
stripped
of
all
but
their
mattresses
and
these
covered
with
heavy
paper
then
on
into
the
kitchen
which
seemed
of
all
the
rooms
to
wear
more
nearly
its
normal
aspect
but
even
there
everything
apparently
appeared
as
it
should
it
was
in
the
kitchen
that
phyllis
stopped
short
and
faced
leslie
well
does
it
beat
everything
she
exclaimed
after
all
we
seen
and
heard
yes
and
there
not
a
thing
here
that
looks
as
if
a
living
soul
had
been
in
it
since
danforth
closed
it
up
now
what
do
you
make
of
it
perhaps
we
have
looked
closely
enough
let
go
over
it
again
was
all
leslie
could
offer
and
is
it
possible
that
a
person
might
come
in
here
for
some
reason
and
not
disturb
anything
yes
of
course
it
possible
but
is
it
likely
countered
phyllis
but
as
you
say
we
better
go
over
the
place
again
and
more
carefully
if
we
do
find
i
shall
certainly
go
back
to
believing
in
my
and
i
guess
you
admit
i
have
foundation
for
it
now
illustration
phyllis
flashed
the
torch
about
in
a
general
survey
i
tell
you
what
suggested
leslie
suppose
we
each
take
a
turn
with
the
and
go
over
every
room
twice
first
you
then
myself
i
noticed
that
when
you
held
the
light
i
had
to
follow
behind
and
look
over
your
shoulder
or
get
in
your
way
and
i
really
could
see
very
well
now
i
sit
in
this
chair
while
you
go
over
the
place
and
then
you
give
the
torch
to
me
how
does
that
strike
you
good
idea
you
full
of
leslie
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
before
and
while
leslie
sat
down
rather
gingerly
in
one
of
the
willow
rockers
against
the
wall
phyllis
systematically
examined
the
room
again
diving
into
all
the
nooks
and
corners
and
at
last
came
back
to
hand
the
torch
to
her
friend
no
luck
it
as
clean
as
a
whistle
of
any
clues
as
far
as
i
can
see
you
take
your
turn
when
leslie
had
completed
her
search
they
proceeded
to
treat
the
other
rooms
in
similar
fashion
and
so
had
come
to
the
last
bedroom
when
they
were
startled
by
a
sound
from
outside
the
house
what
in
the
world
is
cried
phyllis
in
a
panic
it
the
most
uncanny
sound
i
ever
heard
they
listened
again
and
caught
the
intonation
of
a
long
moan
ending
in
a
rising
note
like
a
wail
it
was
truly
a
little
in
the
closed
forsaken
spot
suddenly
leslie
giggled
oh
it
only
rags
he
missed
me
at
last
traced
me
here
and
is
probably
sitting
by
that
side
door
now
protesting
against
having
been
deserted
phyllis
was
both
relieved
at
the
explanation
and
annoyed
at
the
interruption
let
go
and
stop
him
right
away
or
he
have
all
the
neighborhood
here
they
hurried
to
the
little
side
door
in
the
pantry
and
snapped
off
their
light
rags
from
the
outside
sniffing
at
the
threshold
sensed
their
approach
and
yapped
joyously
but
how
are
you
going
to
lock
that
door
after
you
whispered
leslie
in
sudden
terror
it
is
possible
trust
me
smiled
the
capable
phyllis
do
you
suppose
i
have
unfastened
it
if
i
could
fasten
it
up
again
i
just
keep
the
hook
in
a
certain
position
with
my
knife
as
i
close
the
door
and
then
gently
drop
it
into
the
ring
through
the
crack
i
done
it
a
dozen
times
leroy
danforth
taught
us
how
leslie
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
phyllis
cautiously
opened
the
door
then
both
girls
started
back
in
genuine
dismay
sitting
in
the
sand
directly
in
front
of
the
door
and
holding
back
the
delighted
rags
by
his
collar
was
of
all
people
most
unwelcome
to
phyllis
her
grinning
brother
ted
the
consternation
of
the
guilty
pair
was
almost
ludicrous
at
least
ted
found
it
so
then
phyllis
recovered
her
and
demanded
what
are
doing
here
i
like
to
know
please
that
a
question
i
prefer
to
ask
of
you
and
with
a
great
deal
more
reason
returned
ted
of
all
the
nervy
things
i
ever
saw
it
you
prowling
around
the
danforths
closed
bungalow
and
sneaking
out
like
a
thief
when
you
thought
no
one
was
around
leslie
felt
herself
turn
red
and
uncomfortable
at
the
accusation
but
phyllis
seemed
in
no
wise
daunted
i
guess
if
i
want
to
show
the
place
to
leslie
there
is
any
particular
harm
in
it
she
been
asking
me
what
it
looked
like
in
there
and
how
it
differed
from
their
house
you
know
perfectly
well
the
danforths
would
care
a
brass
farthing
this
statement
happened
to
be
entirely
true
for
leslie
questioned
her
only
the
day
before
as
to
the
interior
arrangements
and
expressed
some
curiosity
to
see
it
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
ease
with
which
phyllis
seemed
to
be
explaining
a
rather
peculiar
situation
ted
however
seemed
only
half
convinced
if
that
so
it
mighty
queer
that
you
looked
so
guilty
and
when
you
came
out
and
saw
me
and
for
goodness
sake
how
long
have
you
been
in
there
anyway
this
rags
dog
came
running
up
the
beach
to
us
at
least
an
hour
ago
and
i
thought
of
course
you
girls
were
somewhere
about
but
when
you
did
appear
after
a
while
i
began
to
get
worried
and
rags
and
i
started
off
to
find
you
he
led
me
straight
here
good
old
chap
and
we
been
sitting
waiting
at
least
fifteen
minutes
then
he
began
to
howl
and
gave
the
game
away
now
please
explain
all
this
i
explain
nothing
further
replied
phyllis
loftily
and
trouble
you
to
tend
to
your
own
affairs
in
the
future
with
which
crushing
rejoinder
she
marched
away
dragging
the
unhappy
leslie
after
her
all
right
just
you
wait
i
dig
out
your
little
secret
he
called
after
them
and
he
will
too
muttered
phyllis
that
is
if
we
do
use
the
greatest
caution
is
it
unfortunate
that
that
wretched
dog
led
him
right
here
however
i
settled
him
for
the
present
and
now
think
about
other
things
but
it
was
not
so
easy
for
leslie
to
forget
the
unpleasantness
of
the
recent
encounter
and
the
implication
that
she
had
been
caught
trespassing
but
phyllis
settled
down
to
steady
talk
about
their
investigations
and
she
presently
forgot
the
impression
it
mighty
strange
that
in
all
our
careful
search
we
did
find
a
single
thing
that
would
indicate
a
recent
visitor
mused
phyllis
did
you
see
anything
any
little
thing
questioned
leslie
phyllis
stared
at
her
in
some
surprise
why
you
i
did
what
makes
you
ask
because
i
leslie
quietly
returned
chapter
vi
leslie
makes
some
deductions
well
of
all
things
ejaculated
the
astonished
phyllis
and
you
never
said
a
word
what
was
it
i
did
say
anything
explained
leslie
because
there
was
hardly
a
chance
it
was
just
before
we
came
out
and
but
what
was
it
never
mind
how
it
happened
cried
phyllis
impatiently
well
this
is
part
of
it
in
that
southwest
bedroom
the
one
facing
our
house
i
saw
a
tiny
string
of
beads
lying
under
the
bureau
just
by
the
front
leg
of
it
the
string
was
just
a
thread
about
three
inches
long
with
some
little
green
beads
on
it
a
few
of
the
beads
had
come
off
it
and
rolled
farther
away
i
picked
one
of
them
up
and
here
it
is
she
held
out
a
little
bead
to
phyllis
but
what
on
earth
is
there
to
exclaimed
phyllis
staring
at
it
disappointedly
i
do
see
what
an
insignificant
little
object
like
this
proves
it
was
probably
left
by
the
danforths
anyway
no
i
do
think
it
was
returned
leslie
quietly
because
the
danforths
seem
to
have
cleaned
the
place
very
thoroughly
the
rest
of
the
floor
was
spick
and
span
as
could
be
i
think
the
string
of
beads
was
part
of
a
fringe
such
as
they
wear
so
much
nowadays
to
trim
nice
dresses
it
probably
caught
in
the
leg
of
that
bureau
and
was
pulled
off
without
its
owner
realizing
it
now
did
any
of
the
danforths
as
far
as
you
know
have
any
dresses
that
they
wore
down
here
phyllis
shook
her
head
i
begin
to
see
what
you
driving
at
leslie
no
there
only
danforth
to
wear
dresses
the
rest
of
the
family
consists
of
her
husband
and
the
boys
i
perfectly
certain
i
never
saw
her
in
a
beaded
dress
and
even
if
she
had
one
i
sure
she
think
of
wearing
it
down
here
not
even
to
travel
home
in
people
bring
elaborate
clothes
to
this
place
and
she
never
been
known
to
i
believe
you
right
if
the
beads
had
been
there
when
the
place
was
cleaned
they
would
have
disappeared
they
must
have
come
there
since
the
mysterious
of
the
footprint
must
have
left
them
but
what
else
was
there
then
i
noticed
another
thing
that
was
curious
and
very
puzzling
i
confess
i
ca
make
much
out
of
it
and
yet
it
may
mean
a
great
deal
it
was
out
by
the
fireplace
in
the
did
you
happen
to
notice
that
one
of
the
bricks
in
the
floor
of
it
looked
as
if
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
pry
it
loose
or
something
the
cement
all
along
one
side
had
been
loosened
and
then
packed
down
into
place
again
and
in
the
corner
i
picked
up
she
held
up
the
blade
of
a
penknife
broken
off
halfway
no
i
had
noticed
it
at
all
exclaimed
phyllis
ruefully
the
truth
is
leslie
i
went
into
that
place
expecting
to
see
it
all
torn
up
or
upheaved
or
something
of
the
kind
something
very
definite
anyway
and
when
i
did
find
anything
of
the
sort
i
was
awfully
disappointed
and
hardly
stopped
to
notice
any
of
these
small
things
but
i
believe
what
you
found
may
be
very
important
and
i
think
you
awfully
clever
to
have
noticed
them
too
why
it
actually
sounds
like
a
regular
detective
story
and
now
that
you
found
these
things
what
do
you
make
out
of
them
have
you
any
ideas
leslie
wrinkled
her
brows
for
an
interval
in
silent
thought
at
last
she
said
yes
i
have
a
good
many
ideas
but
i
have
had
time
to
get
them
into
any
order
yet
they
all
sort
of
chaotic
oh
never
mind
cried
the
phyllis
tell
me
them
anyway
i
do
care
how
chaotic
they
are
well
to
begin
with
has
this
occurred
to
you
whoever
comes
here
selects
only
a
stormy
rainy
night
for
a
visit
now
unless
they
think
it
the
best
kind
of
time
to
escape
observation
they
just
calculate
on
few
people
going
out
or
even
out
of
their
houses
on
that
kind
of
a
night
is
that
so
it
certainly
seems
to
be
agreed
phyllis
but
what
do
you
prove
by
that
i
do
anything
but
i
drawn
a
conclusion
from
it
that
tell
you
later
then
there
the
matter
of
this
little
bead
i
know
you
rather
scorned
it
when
i
first
showed
it
to
you
but
do
you
realize
one
thing
we
may
be
able
to
identify
the
owner
by
means
of
it
phyllis
stared
at
her
incredulously
but
leslie
continued
yes
i
really
think
so
and
i
tell
you
why
this
is
an
ordinary
bead
in
the
first
place
it
a
rather
peculiar
shade
of
green
one
you
ordinarily
see
then
though
it
so
small
it
cut
in
a
different
way
too
sort
of
only
with
about
six
sides
do
you
see
on
closer
examination
phyllis
did
see
and
she
had
to
acknowledge
that
leslie
was
right
then
there
the
broken
penknife
and
the
brick
with
one
side
pried
out
went
on
leslie
it
pretty
plain
that
the
person
was
trying
to
pry
up
that
brick
with
the
penknife
and
found
it
hard
work
because
the
mortar
or
cement
is
solid
then
the
blade
of
the
knife
broke
and
the
attempt
was
probably
given
up
now
why
did
they
want
to
pry
up
that
brick
i
know
i
know
cried
phyllis
triumphantly
they
wanted
to
bury
dragon
secret
under
it
maybe
they
did
and
maybe
they
did
replied
leslie
more
cautiously
they
certainly
tried
to
pry
up
the
brick
but
perhaps
it
was
to
for
something
under
it
rather
than
to
hide
anything
however
i
rather
think
it
was
to
hide
it
and
because
they
did
succeed
they
went
out
and
buried
it
in
the
sand
instead
how
about
phyllis
sprang
up
and
hugged
her
impetuously
you
have
a
brain
like
a
regulation
she
laughed
what
else
well
this
is
what
i
ca
understand
suppose
this
person
we
sure
now
it
must
be
a
woman
came
down
here
that
first
stormy
night
with
dragon
secret
and
tried
to
hide
it
somewhere
and
finally
buried
it
in
the
sand
outside
the
question
is
what
did
she
come
for
the
time
to
get
it
again
suggested
phyllis
i
almost
absolutely
certain
not
because
if
so
all
she
would
have
had
to
do
was
to
go
outside
and
dig
of
course
she
would
have
found
it
because
we
had
it
but
she
never
went
outside
at
all
i
know
that
positively
i
passed
right
by
the
place
where
rags
dug
the
hole
on
my
way
up
from
your
bungalow
and
it
was
quite
untouched
just
as
we
left
it
after
we
filled
it
up
again
that
day
and
when
we
came
back
again
i
looked
a
second
time
and
still
it
was
the
same
and
i
watched
half
the
night
and
would
certainly
have
seen
if
any
one
had
gone
there
no
sure
it
was
for
that
but
what
was
it
for
give
it
up
advised
phyllis
at
least
for
the
present
anything
else
no
except
the
conclusion
i
drew
about
the
person
coming
on
a
stormy
night
do
you
realize
this
there
quite
a
big
chance
that
they
or
rather
will
come
again
on
the
stormy
night
perhaps
well
if
that
the
case
exclaimed
phyllis
i
drawn
a
little
conclusion
of
my
own
the
next
stormy
night
i
going
to
spend
at
your
bungalow
and
we
going
to
keep
awake
all
night
chapter
vii
a
new
development
but
the
weather
remained
quite
clear
for
several
nights
after
this
and
meantime
other
things
happened
that
gave
a
new
twist
to
the
conjectures
two
mornings
after
the
events
of
the
last
chapter
phyllis
appeared
at
rest
haven
with
a
mysterious
wrapped
parcel
in
her
hand
answering
leslie
curious
glance
she
whispered
i
want
you
to
take
this
thing
and
keep
it
here
and
hide
it
it
dragon
secret
i
do
feel
safe
a
minute
with
it
around
our
place
since
ted
performance
the
other
day
you
know
he
boasted
he
find
out
our
secret
and
he
will
certainly
make
every
effort
to
or
i
do
know
him
whether
he
succeed
or
not
depends
upon
how
clever
are
in
spoiling
his
plans
if
he
found
this
though
we
might
as
well
not
try
to
keep
the
rest
from
him
i
discovered
him
snooping
around
my
room
rather
suspiciously
yesterday
this
was
locked
up
in
my
trunk
and
he
he
was
only
hunting
for
fudge
but
anyhow
you
better
keep
it
now
if
you
can
think
of
some
safe
place
to
hide
it
i
sure
i
do
know
where
to
put
it
sighed
leslie
rather
worried
by
the
responsibility
aunt
marcia
and
i
shared
one
big
trunk
because
it
did
seem
worth
while
to
bring
two
when
one
needs
so
few
things
here
so
of
course
i
could
put
it
in
there
and
the
lock
of
my
suitcase
is
broken
there
is
a
with
a
key
in
the
whole
bungalow
so
what
am
i
going
to
do
for
a
time
phyllis
was
equally
puzzled
then
suddenly
she
had
a
bright
idea
i
tell
you
that
top
shelf
in
your
pantry
where
the
refrigerator
is
you
said
you
put
quite
a
few
kitchen
things
that
you
did
use
there
and
it
dark
and
unhandy
and
neither
your
aunt
nor
any
one
else
would
think
of
disturbing
it
would
that
be
the
best
place
really
i
guess
you
right
admitted
leslie
considerably
relieved
wait
till
aunt
marcia
has
gone
to
sit
on
the
front
veranda
and
we
can
put
it
there
the
dragon
secret
had
probably
known
some
strange
in
its
time
but
doubtless
none
stranger
than
the
one
in
which
it
now
found
itself
a
dark
rather
dusty
top
shelf
in
a
pantry
hobnobbing
with
a
few
pots
and
pans
and
discarded
but
the
girls
tucked
it
far
into
a
corner
and
wrapped
in
its
burlap
bag
it
was
as
successfully
concealed
as
it
would
have
been
in
a
and
now
there
something
i
been
wanting
to
ask
you
said
leslie
as
the
two
girls
strolled
down
to
the
beach
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
about
the
people
who
hired
curlew
nest
the
latter
part
of
this
summer
oh
yes
answered
phyllis
though
i
did
happen
to
see
them
myself
danforth
told
me
that
in
july
the
remsons
had
it
as
they
always
do
but
in
august
and
september
she
rented
it
to
an
elderly
gentleman
i
ca
think
of
his
name
just
this
minute
who
stayed
there
all
by
himself
with
only
his
man
or
valet
to
do
all
the
work
he
was
very
well
was
recovering
from
some
kind
of
a
fever
i
think
and
wanted
to
be
alone
in
some
quiet
place
you
know
danforth
herself
spent
all
summer
in
your
bungalow
and
she
said
she
saw
very
little
of
the
man
in
curlew
nest
though
they
were
such
near
neighbors
he
sat
on
his
porch
or
in
the
house
a
great
deal
or
took
long
walks
by
himself
on
the
beach
he
used
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
her
and
make
some
other
formal
remarks
but
that
was
about
all
she
was
really
rather
curious
about
him
he
seemed
so
anxious
not
to
mix
with
other
people
or
be
talked
to
but
he
left
about
the
middle
of
september
and
she
closed
up
that
bungalow
for
the
winter
that
about
all
i
know
it
too
bad
you
ca
think
of
his
name
exclaimed
leslie
why
demanded
phyllis
suddenly
curious
you
surely
do
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
affair
do
you
but
leslie
countered
that
question
by
asking
another
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
as
strange
phyllis
that
whoever
got
into
that
bungalow
lately
knew
the
little
secret
about
the
side
door
and
worked
it
so
cleverly
phyllis
eyes
grew
wide
and
she
seized
leslie
arm
in
so
muscular
a
grip
that
leslie
winced
no
it
did
you
little
but
i
see
what
you
driving
at
to
know
about
that
side
door
one
must
have
been
pretty
well
acquainted
with
that
bungalow
in
it
for
a
while
aha
no
wonder
you
curious
about
the
last
occupant
we
have
to
count
that
old
gentleman
in
on
this
yes
but
here
the
mystery
reminded
leslie
you
said
he
lived
here
alone
except
for
his
remember
please
that
the
footprint
we
saw
was
a
phyllis
tore
at
her
hair
in
mock
despair
worse
and
more
of
it
she
groaned
but
the
deeper
it
gets
the
more
determined
i
grow
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
they
strolled
on
a
while
in
silence
suddenly
phyllis
asked
rags
this
morning
he
does
seem
to
feel
very
well
something
seems
to
have
disagreed
with
him
perhaps
too
many
anyway
he
lying
around
on
the
veranda
and
seems
to
want
to
stay
near
aunt
marcia
and
sleep
she
said
she
keep
him
there
best
news
i
heard
in
an
age
exclaimed
phyllis
delightedly
that
dog
is
a
most
faithful
article
leslie
but
he
a
decided
nuisance
sometimes
and
now
i
have
a
gorgeous
idea
that
i
been
wanting
to
try
for
two
days
father
and
ted
have
gone
off
for
the
day
up
the
inlet
and
rags
is
out
of
commission
here
our
chance
do
you
realize
that
one
bedroom
in
curlew
nest
we
did
have
a
chance
to
explore
the
other
day
let
go
and
do
it
right
now
i
run
down
to
our
house
for
the
electric
torch
and
meet
you
at
the
side
door
there
not
a
soul
around
to
interfere
with
us
oh
no
phyllis
i
really
do
think
we
ought
objected
leslie
recalling
all
too
vividly
the
unpleasantness
of
their
former
experience
but
phyllis
was
off
and
far
away
while
she
was
still
expostulating
and
in
the
end
leslie
found
herself
awaiting
her
companion
in
the
vicinity
of
the
side
door
of
curlew
nest
they
entered
the
dark
bungalow
with
beating
hearts
more
aware
this
time
than
ever
that
mystery
lurked
in
the
depth
of
it
straight
to
the
unexplored
bedroom
they
proceeded
for
as
leslie
reminded
them
they
had
no
time
to
waste
rags
might
have
an
untimely
recovery
and
come
seeking
them
as
before
ted
also
might
be
prompted
by
his
evil
genius
to
descend
on
them
or
even
aunt
marcia
might
be
minded
to
hunt
them
up
the
bedroom
in
question
as
phyllis
now
recalled
was
the
southwest
one
and
the
one
danforth
said
that
the
last
tenant
had
chosen
for
his
own
therefore
it
ought
to
be
more
than
ordinarily
interesting
went
on
phyllis
i
remember
now
that
danforth
said
he
had
asked
permission
to
leave
there
as
a
little
contribution
to
the
bungalow
a
few
books
that
he
had
finished
with
and
did
not
wish
to
carry
away
she
left
them
right
where
they
were
on
a
shelf
in
his
room
instead
of
putting
them
in
the
bookcase
in
the
i
sort
of
remembering
these
things
she
told
me
piecemeal
because
danforth
is
a
great
talker
and
is
always
giving
you
a
lot
of
details
about
things
you
not
particularly
interested
in
and
you
try
to
listen
politely
but
often
find
it
an
awful
bore
then
you
try
to
forget
it
all
as
soon
as
possible
they
found
the
bedroom
in
question
somewhat
more
spacious
and
better
furnished
than
the
others
but
though
they
examined
every
nook
and
cranny
with
care
they
discovered
nothing
thrilling
or
even
enlightening
within
its
walls
till
they
came
to
the
shelf
of
books
these
with
the
exception
of
two
books
of
recent
fiction
were
all
of
travel
and
politics
in
foreign
countries
my
but
he
must
have
been
interested
in
india
and
china
and
tibet
and
those
countries
exclaimed
leslie
reading
the
titles
i
wonder
why
she
took
one
of
them
down
and
turned
the
pages
idly
as
she
did
so
something
fluttered
out
and
fell
to
the
floor
oh
she
cried
picking
it
up
and
examining
it
phyllis
this
may
prove
very
valuable
do
you
see
what
it
is
it
was
an
envelop
of
thin
paper
an
empty
envelop
forgotten
and
useless
unless
perhaps
it
had
been
employed
as
a
bookmark
but
on
it
was
a
name
the
name
no
doubt
of
the
recipient
of
the
letter
it
had
once
contained
and
also
a
foreign
address
do
you
see
what
it
says
went
on
leslie
excitedly
arthur
des
why
phyllis
that
his
name
which
you
could
remember
and
he
was
evidently
at
some
time
in
peking
but
phyllis
was
puckering
her
brows
in
an
effort
of
memory
there
some
mistake
here
i
guess
she
remarked
at
length
for
now
i
recall
that
danforth
said
his
name
was
horatio
gaines
leslie
dropped
the
envelop
back
in
the
book
the
picture
of
disappointment
it
does
seem
likely
he
have
someone
else
envelops
in
his
books
she
remarked
and
i
think
honorable
arthur
ramsay
of
peking
sounds
far
more
thrilling
than
plain
gaines
let
look
through
the
rest
of
the
books
and
see
if
we
can
discover
anything
else
they
examined
them
all
but
found
nothing
more
of
interest
and
leslie
suggested
uneasily
that
they
had
better
go
but
there
one
thing
i
must
see
first
decided
phyllis
the
beads
and
broken
penknife
you
found
i
been
wild
to
look
at
them
for
myself
come
along
we
have
time
for
that
they
made
their
way
cautiously
into
the
next
bedroom
bent
down
and
turned
the
torch
toward
the
floor
under
the
bureau
where
leslie
had
made
the
discovery
then
both
girls
simultaneously
gasped
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
beads
anywhere
to
be
seen
phyllis
breathed
leslie
in
frightened
wonder
it
gone
the
whole
string
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
come
cried
phyllis
dragging
leslie
after
her
let
go
and
see
if
the
broken
penknife
blade
is
there
yet
if
that
gone
too
something
new
has
happened
here
they
hurried
to
the
and
bent
over
the
fireplace
the
brick
was
there
as
leslie
had
described
it
but
of
the
broken
penknife
blade
in
the
corner
there
was
not
a
vestige
to
be
seen
chapter
viii
the
clue
of
the
green
bead
with
shaking
knees
and
blank
dismay
on
their
faces
they
crept
out
of
curlew
nest
and
fastened
the
door
then
they
hurried
down
to
the
water
edge
and
sat
on
a
rise
of
sand
to
talk
it
over
what
can
it
all
mean
phyllis
quavered
leslie
it
means
that
some
one
has
been
in
there
again
since
day
before
yesterday
declared
her
companion
though
it
been
bright
moonlight
for
the
past
two
nights
and
how
they
got
in
without
being
seen
i
quite
understand
you
said
you
kept
some
sort
of
watch
did
you
i
certainly
did
i
have
gone
to
bed
till
late
and
every
once
in
a
while
during
the
night
i
waked
up
and
looked
over
there
it
seem
possible
they
would
dare
to
come
with
the
moonlight
bright
as
day
all
night
long
of
course
that
side
door
is
on
the
opposite
side
from
us
and
the
only
way
i
could
tell
would
be
by
seeing
a
light
through
the
cracks
of
the
shutter
perhaps
if
they
had
had
a
very
bright
light
i
would
know
but
what
did
they
come
for
questioned
phyllis
why
that
simple
they
came
back
to
get
the
beads
and
the
probably
it
was
the
she
and
she
came
to
get
those
things
because
she
realized
they
been
left
there
and
might
be
discovered
by
some
one
else
what
else
could
it
be
of
course
you
must
be
right
agreed
phyllis
but
it
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
anyway
there
thing
the
lady
know
that
we
have
still
one
of
the
beads
i
wonder
how
she
feel
if
she
realize
it
do
you
ever
wonder
what
that
mysterious
lady
is
like
asked
leslie
i
often
try
to
picture
her
from
the
very
very
little
we
know
about
her
i
think
she
is
tall
and
dark
and
slender
and
very
very
stylishly
dressed
she
has
rather
sad
brown
eyes
and
is
quite
and
would
be
very
interesting
to
know
well
i
do
imagine
her
that
way
at
all
replied
phyllis
to
me
it
seems
as
if
she
must
be
large
and
imposing
with
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
and
very
quick
vivacious
manners
i
agree
that
she
is
no
doubt
dressed
in
a
very
style
and
is
probably
about
or
forty
years
old
i
do
know
whether
i
like
to
know
her
or
not
but
i
like
to
know
what
she
after
in
that
bungalow
so
they
continued
to
conjecture
and
imagine
till
phyllis
finally
exclaimed
why
there
are
father
and
ted
back
already
fishing
must
have
been
poor
this
morning
thank
goodness
we
got
out
of
that
place
when
we
did
but
that
reminds
me
i
ought
to
go
to
the
village
and
order
some
supplies
the
grocer
does
come
here
again
for
two
days
do
you
want
to
walk
down
with
me
it
a
gorgeous
morning
for
a
i
believe
i
will
agreed
leslie
that
is
if
aunt
marcia
can
get
along
without
me
i
have
had
a
good
walk
in
so
long
that
i
fairly
ache
for
one
i
go
and
see
if
aunt
marcia
would
like
me
to
get
her
anything
and
i
meet
you
in
five
minutes
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
morning
for
a
walk
the
crisp
october
air
was
as
clear
as
crystal
and
the
salt
meadows
back
of
the
dunes
were
still
gay
with
goldenrod
and
the
deeper
autumn
colorings
the
creek
that
wound
through
them
was
a
ribbon
of
intense
blue
and
a
thousand
twittered
and
darted
and
swooped
over
its
surface
but
the
two
girls
were
for
once
almost
blind
to
the
beauty
of
it
all
so
absorbed
were
they
in
the
topic
of
their
mystery
and
the
village
was
reached
almost
before
they
realized
they
were
in
its
vicinity
phyllis
did
her
shopping
first
in
the
general
grocery
store
then
leslie
suggested
that
they
visit
the
little
store
and
look
up
some
wool
for
miss
marcia
knitting
it
was
a
very
tiny
little
store
kept
by
a
tiny
rather
sleepy
old
lady
who
took
a
long
time
to
find
the
articles
her
customers
required
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
never
locate
the
box
with
the
right
shade
of
wool
in
it
while
they
were
waiting
not
altogether
patiently
a
handsome
automobile
drew
up
in
front
of
the
store
its
only
occupant
was
a
young
girl
scarcely
older
than
leslie
and
phyllis
and
by
the
ease
with
which
she
handled
the
car
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
she
was
an
accomplished
driver
in
another
moment
she
had
entered
the
store
and
was
standing
beside
the
two
girls
waiting
to
be
served
she
was
short
and
slender
in
build
with
a
complexion
of
marvelous
clearness
and
fluffy
hair
under
the
heavy
coat
which
she
had
unbuttoned
on
entering
the
store
could
be
seen
a
stylish
suit
of
english
tweeds
very
and
and
a
smart
tam
crowned
her
hair
after
the
pleasant
manner
of
the
villagers
and
accustomed
summer
people
phyllis
bade
her
good
morning
but
to
the
astonishment
of
both
girls
instead
of
replying
in
an
equally
pleasant
manner
she
stared
at
them
both
up
and
down
for
a
moment
then
turned
away
with
only
an
ungracious
nod
the
indignant
pair
left
her
severely
alone
after
that
except
for
a
furtive
glance
or
two
when
she
was
looking
the
other
way
but
when
they
had
at
last
ascertained
that
old
selby
had
after
all
wool
of
the
shade
required
leslie
hurried
phyllis
out
with
what
seemed
almost
unnecessary
haste
the
little
wretch
sputtered
phyllis
once
safely
outside
did
you
see
worse
manners
but
she
never
mind
about
her
manners
whispered
leslie
excitedly
did
you
notice
anything
else
noticed
that
she
was
very
smart
looking
and
quite
pretty
that
is
i
thought
so
at
first
but
after
she
acted
that
way
she
seemed
positively
no
no
i
do
mean
that
did
you
notice
anything
about
her
dress
her
clothes
oh
do
tell
me
what
you
mean
cried
phyllis
how
you
do
love
to
mystify
a
person
well
whispered
leslie
her
eyes
still
on
the
door
of
the
little
store
when
she
threw
open
her
coat
i
just
happened
to
glance
at
her
dress
and
noticed
that
it
had
a
girdle
of
some
dark
green
material
and
the
two
ends
had
fringes
of
beads
the
beads
were
just
like
the
ones
in
curlew
phyllis
simply
stared
at
her
and
incredulous
it
be
she
muttered
at
length
even
if
the
beads
were
like
the
ones
you
found
there
are
probably
more
persons
than
one
who
have
some
like
them
yes
that
true
admitted
leslie
but
the
color
and
queer
shape
everything
at
least
it
something
worth
investigating
the
first
real
clue
we
had
at
that
moment
the
girl
in
question
came
out
of
the
store
sprang
into
the
car
whirled
the
wheel
about
and
was
off
down
the
street
in
a
cloud
of
dust
they
stood
gazing
after
her
it
does
seem
possible
exclaimed
phyllis
it
just
ca
be
and
yet
tell
you
what
i
just
wondering
whether
she
staying
anywhere
around
here
or
is
just
a
casual
stranger
passing
through
the
town
go
in
and
ask
old
selby
if
she
knows
anything
about
her
if
staying
here
selby
will
positively
know
it
i
make
the
excuse
of
having
forgotten
to
buy
something
come
along
she
hustled
leslie
back
into
the
little
shop
and
soon
had
little
selby
hunting
for
a
size
and
variety
of
shell
of
which
she
had
no
need
whatever
as
she
possessed
already
a
plentiful
supply
at
home
but
it
was
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
at
the
moment
when
they
were
being
wrapped
she
asked
quite
casually
was
that
young
girl
who
just
went
out
a
stranger
here
selby
or
is
she
stopping
in
the
village
seems
to
me
i
do
recall
her
face
oh
she
ai
exactly
a
stranger
replied
selby
with
alacrity
quite
waking
up
at
the
prospect
of
retailing
a
bit
of
gossip
but
she
ai
been
around
here
so
long
only
a
couple
of
weeks
or
so
she
comes
in
here
once
in
a
while
but
she
ai
very
friendly
like
never
passes
the
time
o
day
nor
nothing
just
asks
for
what
she
wants
and
goes
out
i
never
did
quite
take
to
manners
like
that
nobody
else
here
acts
so
not
even
the
summer
folks
i
ca
think
how
she
was
brung
up
they
do
say
as
she
ai
an
american
that
she
english
or
something
but
i
do
know
for
sure
anyhow
she
do
mix
with
no
one
just
runs
around
in
that
ottymobile
all
the
time
where
she
stopping
went
on
phyllis
the
hotel
is
closed
i
thought
all
the
summer
people
but
ourselves
had
gone
oh
she
boarding
up
to
aunt
sally
blake
i
dunno
how
she
come
to
go
there
but
there
she
is
i
wonder
how
aunt
sally
gets
along
with
her
have
you
heard
what
her
name
is
pursued
phyllis
as
she
received
her
parcel
they
do
say
her
name
is
ramsay
miss
ramsay
good
morning
young
ladies
and
thank
you
come
in
again
soon
when
they
were
out
on
the
street
leslie
clutched
phyllis
spasmodically
and
her
eyes
were
almost
popping
out
of
her
head
is
there
the
least
doubt
in
your
mind
phyllis
kelvin
she
demanded
her
name
is
ramsay
the
very
same
name
that
was
on
the
envelop
in
the
book
and
phyllis
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
herself
convinced
chapter
ix
aunt
sally
adds
to
the
mystification
the
two
girls
walked
home
in
a
state
bordering
on
stupefaction
every
little
while
phyllis
would
stop
to
ejaculate
who
would
have
thought
it
the
horrid
little
snob
i
really
ca
believe
yet
that
it
is
she
leslie
our
she
i
sure
there
must
be
some
mistake
well
of
course
it
not
be
so
leslie
admitted
but
you
must
see
how
many
things
point
to
it
the
beads
are
identical
i
stood
so
near
her
that
i
had
a
fine
chance
to
see
them
closely
her
name
is
the
same
as
the
one
on
the
envelop
in
the
book
yes
but
that
is
the
name
of
the
man
who
hired
the
bungalow
objected
phyllis
that
quite
true
but
even
so
you
ca
tell
what
connection
there
may
be
with
the
other
name
it
is
exactly
a
common
one
and
that
makes
it
all
the
more
likely
that
we
may
be
right
and
then
there
the
fact
of
her
being
so
near
here
right
in
the
village
i
have
always
imagined
that
whoever
it
was
had
to
come
from
quite
a
distance
and
i
always
wondered
how
she
managed
it
so
late
at
night
but
leslie
why
on
earth
should
she
come
to
that
bungalow
in
the
dead
of
night
in
a
storm
and
hide
that
secret
what
mysterious
affair
can
she
be
mixed
up
with
anyway
leslie
however
had
no
solution
to
offer
to
this
poser
but
she
did
have
a
sudden
idea
that
made
her
stop
short
in
the
road
and
gasp
do
you
realize
phyllis
kelvin
that
we
are
doing
a
very
questionable
yes
a
thing
in
keeping
the
secret
when
it
evidently
belongs
to
this
girl
how
do
you
it
belongs
to
this
girl
countered
phyllis
you
only
that
it
may
when
all
said
and
done
you
did
see
her
hide
it
there
you
did
even
see
at
the
bungalow
we
may
be
way
off
the
track
for
all
you
know
and
we
be
a
pretty
pair
of
geese
to
go
and
meekly
hand
it
to
her
should
we
and
do
you
know
even
if
i
was
simply
it
was
hers
i
just
would
give
it
to
her
anyway
for
a
while
i
let
her
stew
and
fret
for
it
for
a
good
long
spell
after
such
hatefulness
phyllis
manner
was
so
vindictive
that
leslie
had
to
smile
in
spite
of
herself
but
oh
see
here
phyllis
went
on
have
an
idea
a
glorious
idea
it
may
help
to
clear
up
a
lot
of
things
i
know
aunt
sally
blake
very
well
and
we
go
and
see
her
this
very
afternoon
perhaps
she
can
give
us
more
light
on
the
subject
but
would
that
seem
too
plainly
like
tracking
down
this
miss
ramsay
objected
leslie
especially
as
she
does
appear
to
care
for
our
acquaintance
not
a
bit
declared
phyllis
positively
you
do
realize
how
well
know
aunt
sally
why
she
a
regular
village
institution
everybody
knows
her
and
thinks
the
world
of
her
she
a
plump
jolly
delightful
old
lady
who
lives
in
a
delightful
old
house
full
of
dear
furniture
she
keeps
a
lot
of
chickens
and
often
sells
them
and
the
fresh
eggs
and
she
does
a
little
sewing
and
sometimes
takes
a
boarder
or
two
and
goes
out
nursing
occasionally
and
oh
i
do
know
what
all
but
i
know
that
we
could
get
along
at
all
around
here
without
aunt
sally
we
go
down
to
her
house
this
afternoon
and
call
i
really
have
been
to
see
her
since
i
came
down
this
time
and
i
ask
her
if
she
has
a
nice
roasting
chicken
that
i
can
have
that
be
a
perfectly
good
excuse
and
if
our
polite
young
lady
is
around
i
try
and
get
her
to
talk
aunt
sally
loves
to
talk
but
she
is
a
gossip
like
old
selby
and
we
have
to
go
at
it
a
little
more
carefully
they
solaced
themselves
with
this
thought
and
awaited
with
more
than
a
little
impatience
the
visit
that
afternoon
surely
aunt
sally
if
any
one
would
be
able
to
solve
some
of
their
mysteries
by
afternoon
the
weather
had
turned
warm
almost
sultry
and
they
found
aunt
sally
sitting
on
her
front
porch
rocking
gently
and
humming
to
herself
over
her
sewing
she
was
delighted
to
see
phyllis
again
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
leslie
whom
phyllis
introduced
as
her
neighbor
and
very
dear
friend
when
they
had
chatted
about
topics
of
common
interest
for
a
while
phyllis
introduced
the
subject
of
the
chicken
bless
your
heart
dear
cried
aunt
sally
i
so
sorry
but
i
a
roasting
chicken
just
now
in
the
whole
yard
nothing
but
fowls
but
i
can
give
you
a
couple
of
nice
young
broilers
and
i
plenty
of
fresh
eggs
phyllis
straightway
arranged
to
have
two
broilers
ready
for
her
when
she
called
for
them
next
day
and
skilfully
changed
the
subject
oh
aunt
sally
do
show
leslie
those
begonias
you
been
raising
all
summer
i
do
think
they
are
the
most
beautiful
things
you
certainly
are
very
successful
at
making
things
grow
highly
flattered
aunt
sally
rose
to
lead
the
girls
indoors
to
the
sunny
room
where
she
kept
her
plants
while
they
were
admiring
them
she
asked
them
to
sit
down
and
rest
a
while
and
talk
an
invitation
they
accepted
with
great
alacrity
at
length
after
a
detailed
account
of
the
health
and
affairs
of
her
entire
family
phyllis
craftily
led
the
conversation
back
to
aunt
sally
herself
and
are
you
alone
now
aunt
sally
or
is
your
sister
still
with
you
i
heard
she
was
going
back
to
ohio
yes
she
gone
and
i
alone
sighed
aunt
sally
at
least
i
not
quite
alone
i
have
a
boarder
at
present
oh
you
exclaimed
phyllis
guilefully
as
if
it
were
all
news
to
her
why
that
very
nice
i
hope
the
boarder
will
stay
a
long
while
it
will
be
some
company
for
you
well
i
dunno
how
long
she
stay
and
she
ai
much
company
for
i
must
confess
admitted
aunt
sally
with
a
somewhat
worried
air
the
truth
is
i
ca
exactly
make
her
out
this
was
precisely
the
line
that
phyllis
wished
her
to
take
yet
even
now
caution
must
be
observed
or
aunt
sally
might
shy
away
from
it
oh
it
a
lady
then
remarked
the
artful
phyllis
well
no
it
ai
exactly
a
lady
it
a
young
girl
the
age
of
you
two
i
should
guess
still
i
do
see
why
she
should
be
company
for
you
even
so
argued
phyllis
quite
as
if
she
were
still
completely
in
the
dark
as
to
this
new
boarder
the
reason
she
ai
much
company
went
on
aunt
sally
is
because
well
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
say
it
but
i
guess
she
thinks
she
too
sort
of
to
with
the
person
who
keeps
her
aunt
sally
laughed
an
amused
throaty
little
chuckle
at
this
and
then
the
worried
frown
came
back
why
she
must
be
rather
horrid
i
think
commented
phyllis
with
more
heartfelt
reason
than
aunt
sally
could
guess
no
i
do
think
she
means
to
be
horrid
she
just
been
brought
up
that
way
i
guess
i
wish
she
could
be
more
friendly
i
sort
of
feel
a
responsibility
about
her
you
see
she
here
all
alone
she
was
staying
at
the
hotel
with
her
grandfather
and
he
suddenly
took
awful
sick
and
had
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
up
at
branchville
she
stayed
on
at
the
hotel
so
to
be
near
him
she
runs
up
there
every
day
in
her
car
and
then
the
hotel
had
to
close
down
for
the
season
the
manager
come
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
could
take
her
in
he
was
kind
of
sorry
for
her
her
grandfather
bein
so
ill
an
she
could
seem
to
find
no
other
place
so
i
did
but
she
worries
me
a
lot
somehow
i
do
like
to
see
a
young
girl
like
that
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
and
she
running
around
loose
in
that
auto
all
the
time
why
she
even
took
it
out
one
rainy
night
last
week
at
ten
said
she
was
worried
about
her
grandfather
but
i
did
approve
of
her
running
all
the
way
up
there
to
branchville
in
the
rain
here
phyllis
glanced
significantly
at
leslie
and
interjected
a
question
did
she
and
her
grandfather
have
one
of
the
bungalows
on
the
beach
this
summer
do
you
know
aunt
sally
why
not
that
i
know
of
she
said
she
been
visiting
some
friends
somewhere
in
maine
and
then
come
on
here
to
join
her
grandfather
just
a
few
days
before
he
was
taken
sick
i
do
think
it
likely
she
ever
stayed
in
one
of
the
bungalows
she
did
seem
to
know
anything
about
this
region
at
first
and
i
likely
have
heard
of
it
if
she
had
but
laws
i
got
biscuits
in
the
oven
and
i
clean
forgetting
them
and
with
a
whisk
of
skirts
aunt
sally
vanished
for
a
moment
into
the
kitchen
what
did
i
tell
you
whispered
leslie
went
out
in
the
rain
one
night
last
week
about
ten
i
warrant
she
did
go
to
the
hospital
or
if
she
did
it
was
after
she
visited
curlew
nest
but
aunt
sally
was
back
almost
immediately
bearing
some
hot
biscuits
and
jam
which
she
hospitably
invited
her
guests
to
try
and
while
they
were
partaking
of
this
refreshment
she
sighed
my
how
i
have
been
gossiping
about
that
poor
girl
i
sort
of
feel
for
i
could
like
her
real
well
if
she
only
let
me
she
a
sort
of
child
i
wish
she
knew
you
two
girls
i
believe
it
would
do
her
a
lot
of
good
to
be
around
with
you
there
she
is
now
she
cried
as
a
car
flashed
past
the
window
and
up
the
driveway
toward
the
barn
just
wait
till
she
comes
in
and
i
introduce
you
no
no
exclaimed
phyllis
hastily
springing
up
better
not
aunt
sally
if
she
does
care
for
you
i
sure
she
would
for
us
besides
we
must
go
right
away
remember
we
both
the
in
our
families
and
even
as
it
is
we
wo
be
back
very
early
it
a
long
walk
and
thank
you
and
i
send
for
the
broilers
and
with
leslie
in
tow
she
hurried
away
leaving
a
somewhat
bewildered
aunt
sally
gazing
after
them
well
i
guess
not
the
idea
of
trying
to
get
acquainted
a
second
time
with
that
difficult
young
person
phyllis
exploded
when
they
were
out
of
and
yet
mused
leslie
as
they
swung
along
unpleasant
as
the
thought
of
it
is
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
get
acquainted
chapter
x
at
dawn
how
do
you
mean
it
might
be
the
best
thing
to
get
acquainted
with
her
demanded
phyllis
indignantly
why
if
we
could
do
so
in
some
way
that
was
like
forcing
ourselves
on
her
it
might
lead
to
a
good
many
things
solving
our
mystery
mainly
and
then
who
knows
she
be
pleasant
when
you
come
to
know
her
better
no
chance
declared
phyllis
and
dismissed
that
subject
well
aunt
sally
did
do
much
toward
clearing
up
things
did
she
she
went
on
i
was
in
hopes
she
be
able
to
give
us
a
good
many
more
ideas
one
certain
though
that
girl
evidently
came
here
in
the
car
that
rainy
night
but
look
here
something
strange
has
just
occurred
to
me
aunt
sally
did
say
rainy
night
and
there
have
been
two
in
the
past
ten
days
i
judge
that
the
girl
must
have
been
with
her
for
at
least
a
couple
of
weeks
for
the
hotel
closed
up
more
than
two
weeks
ago
i
been
thinking
of
that
too
replied
leslie
and
do
you
know
almost
certain
aunt
sally
must
have
meant
the
one
because
she
only
said
night
if
she
meant
that
other
would
she
have
said
night
of
the
hard
storm
or
something
like
that
because
it
really
unusual
and
if
this
miss
ramsay
had
gone
out
night
i
believe
aunt
sally
would
have
been
considerably
more
shocked
and
would
have
said
so
what
do
you
make
of
it
the
only
thing
i
can
make
out
of
it
is
that
she
did
go
out
that
first
night
but
if
she
visit
curlew
nest
that
night
then
who
in
the
world
this
certainly
was
a
poser
and
neither
of
the
two
girls
could
find
an
adequate
conjecture
that
would
answer
then
this
horatio
gaines
who
hired
the
bungalow
must
be
her
grandfather
of
course
the
is
different
but
he
may
be
the
grandfather
on
her
mother
side
but
if
that
is
the
case
who
is
the
arthur
ramsay
questioned
phyllis
perhaps
her
father
or
her
other
grandfather
ventured
leslie
that
possible
but
i
wish
i
had
found
out
from
aunt
sally
if
she
knew
the
name
of
the
grandfather
who
is
that
might
explain
something
i
wish
i
had
asked
her
at
the
time
i
believe
i
go
for
the
broilers
myself
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
any
more
in
some
way
that
wo
make
her
suspect
declared
phyllis
the
next
morning
phyllis
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
went
down
to
the
village
alone
as
leslie
had
matters
that
kept
her
at
home
that
day
but
she
came
flying
back
breathless
to
impart
her
news
i
managed
to
lead
the
conversation
around
to
that
grandfather
business
again
panted
phyllis
to
leslie
when
she
had
induced
her
chum
to
come
down
to
the
beach
for
a
moment
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
that
his
name
was
now
what
do
you
make
of
if
his
name
is
ramsay
he
ca
be
the
man
who
hired
that
bungalow
and
we
all
on
the
wrong
track
no
it
does
prove
that
at
all
insisted
leslie
the
one
who
rented
the
bungalow
no
matter
what
his
name
was
certainly
had
an
envelop
in
his
possession
addressed
to
so
you
see
there
a
connection
somewhere
phyllis
had
to
admit
that
this
was
so
but
here
something
else
stranger
than
that
what
do
you
think
of
my
having
been
introduced
to
and
becoming
acquainted
with
our
young
friend
leslie
certainly
opened
her
eyes
in
astonishment
you
surely
joking
she
exclaimed
no
positive
truth
it
happened
this
way
i
was
just
about
to
leave
with
my
chickens
under
my
arm
when
in
walks
this
precious
miss
ramsay
right
into
the
room
i
could
see
she
was
prepared
to
turn
on
that
cold
stare
effect
again
but
i
never
so
much
as
noticed
her
existence
and
then
aunt
sally
bustled
in
she
been
upstairs
a
minute
and
blest
if
she
introduce
us
after
all
said
the
most
complimentary
things
about
yours
truly
and
how
i
was
staying
at
my
bungalow
on
the
beach
and
then
she
mentioned
you
too
and
told
about
you
being
in
the
bungalow
it
struck
me
that
our
young
lady
sort
of
pricked
up
her
ears
at
that
though
it
have
been
only
imagination
but
she
just
said
rather
carelessly
did
offer
to
shake
hands
or
anything
i
muttered
something
about
it
being
a
pleasant
day
and
hoping
she
was
enjoying
the
place
but
she
only
replied
thanks
with
that
awfully
english
accent
and
walked
out
of
the
room
well
anyhow
formally
acquainted
now
whether
either
one
of
us
enjoy
it
or
not
and
that
may
be
a
useful
thing
later
perhaps
it
was
still
dark
the
next
morning
when
leslie
awoke
from
a
dreamless
sleep
awoke
suddenly
with
the
distinct
impression
that
something
unusual
was
happening
she
lay
perfectly
still
for
several
moments
trying
to
localize
the
sensation
more
definitely
in
her
room
were
two
windows
a
small
one
facing
curlew
nest
and
a
large
broad
one
facing
the
sea
leslie
always
had
this
window
wide
open
and
her
bed
was
so
placed
that
she
could
easily
look
out
of
it
she
did
so
now
and
noticed
the
first
light
streak
of
dawn
along
the
east
and
a
brilliant
star
so
close
to
the
horizon
that
it
seemed
to
be
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
tossing
ocean
then
her
heart
leaped
and
felt
as
if
it
almost
turned
over
for
between
her
and
the
light
at
the
window
she
descried
the
shape
of
a
dark
head
involuntarily
leslie
sprang
up
to
a
sitting
position
then
the
tension
relaxed
and
she
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
it
was
only
rags
standing
on
his
hind
legs
at
the
window
his
great
shaggy
head
silhouetted
against
the
light
in
another
instant
he
had
uttered
his
low
rumbling
growl
of
uneasiness
what
is
it
rags
what
do
you
see
she
called
softly
to
him
he
forsook
the
window
for
a
moment
and
trotted
over
to
nuzzle
his
head
on
her
pillow
but
almost
immediately
hurried
back
to
his
post
at
the
window
there
something
worrying
him
she
thought
now
i
wonder
what
it
can
be
suppose
suppose
it
were
some
one
around
that
other
bungalow
again
i
better
get
up
and
see
she
rose
softly
slipped
on
a
warm
and
slippers
and
peered
first
out
of
the
side
window
at
curlew
nest
but
the
darkness
was
still
intense
on
this
side
there
was
no
light
in
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
and
she
was
forced
after
watching
for
several
moments
to
conclude
that
nothing
was
amiss
in
this
region
then
she
went
to
the
window
facing
the
ocean
pushed
rags
aside
a
trifle
and
cuddled
down
beside
him
on
the
the
dawn
was
growing
every
moment
brighter
the
streak
of
gray
along
the
horizon
had
grown
to
a
broad
belt
of
pink
and
very
faintly
the
objects
on
the
beach
were
beginning
to
be
visible
rags
still
rumbled
his
uneasy
growl
at
intervals
and
stared
intently
at
something
leslie
eye
could
not
yet
discern
it
was
only
by
following
the
direction
of
his
gaze
that
she
presently
realized
there
was
something
moving
on
the
beach
somewhere
in
front
of
curlew
nest
then
her
heart
actually
did
seem
to
stop
beating
for
an
instant
for
in
the
growing
light
she
at
last
could
distinguish
a
dark
form
moving
stealthily
about
by
the
old
log
where
rags
had
dug
up
the
dragon
secret
oh
who
can
it
be
and
what
are
they
doing
there
she
whispered
distractedly
to
rags
the
dog
only
reply
was
to
growl
a
little
louder
and
she
promptly
silenced
him
be
a
good
dog
rags
do
make
a
sound
it
will
rouse
aunt
marcia
and
besides
i
see
who
is
there
if
possible
rags
settled
down
again
to
a
quieter
watch
with
evident
reluctance
with
every
passing
moment
day
was
approaching
nearer
and
the
scene
out
over
the
ocean
was
one
of
surprising
beauty
had
leslie
only
been
less
occupied
and
had
time
to
observe
it
the
band
of
pink
had
melted
into
gold
and
a
thousand
rosy
little
clouds
dimpled
the
sky
above
it
was
now
so
light
that
the
dark
shape
on
the
beach
stood
out
with
comparative
clearness
it
had
been
bending
down
and
rising
up
at
intervals
and
it
took
little
guessing
on
leslie
part
to
conjecture
what
was
happening
some
one
was
digging
in
the
spot
where
the
dragon
secret
had
been
hidden
what
if
it
is
miss
ramsay
thought
leslie
oh
it
be
she
who
else
could
it
be
she
looking
for
that
box
and
she
ca
find
it
because
we
taken
it
away
oh
what
ought
i
to
do
about
it
if
only
phyllis
were
here
at
this
moment
she
realized
from
the
actions
of
the
unknown
person
that
the
search
was
evidently
abandoned
the
figure
stood
upright
struck
its
hands
together
and
threw
away
some
implement
like
a
board
with
which
the
digging
had
been
done
then
with
a
discouraged
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
hasty
glance
back
at
the
two
cottages
it
turned
and
walked
away
down
the
beach
and
was
shortly
out
of
sight
and
it
was
then
that
leslie
sank
back
on
the
window
seat
with
a
little
gasp
of
sheer
astonishment
the
figure
was
not
not
have
been
that
of
miss
ramsay
it
was
a
a
tall
burly
man
and
as
he
walked
away
his
gait
gave
evidence
of
a
decided
limp
chapter
xi
an
unexpected
visitor
so
anxious
was
leslie
to
impart
this
newest
development
to
phyllis
that
morning
that
she
ate
no
breakfast
at
all
a
departure
which
worried
miss
marcia
not
a
little
but
leslie
was
out
of
the
house
and
off
the
moment
she
had
finished
washing
the
dishes
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
locate
her
companion
as
the
kelvins
had
gone
off
early
on
a
fishing
expedition
a
short
way
up
the
inlet
having
persuaded
phyllis
to
join
them
a
thing
she
had
done
but
little
of
late
after
a
long
walk
and
much
however
leslie
sighted
their
boat
and
it
took
considerable
time
before
she
could
persuade
phyllis
to
come
ashore
as
she
could
not
very
well
impart
to
her
standing
on
the
bank
that
she
had
news
of
vital
importance
concerning
their
secret
when
phyllis
had
at
last
been
lured
ashore
and
the
two
had
walked
away
out
of
sight
she
told
the
tale
of
her
curious
experience
at
dawn
and
now
phyllis
what
do
you
make
of
it
she
demanded
wide
eyed
there
only
one
thing
to
make
of
it
returned
phyllis
gravely
and
that
is
there
some
one
else
mixed
up
in
this
some
one
we
known
about
or
counted
on
at
all
i
thought
miss
ramsay
all
along
was
the
only
one
concerned
in
it
now
we
can
only
guess
that
that
is
so
but
how
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
whole
thing
is
beyond
me
what
kind
of
a
man
did
you
say
he
was
leslie
described
him
again
of
course
it
was
still
hardly
light
and
i
could
see
him
plainly
at
all
she
ended
i
never
even
got
a
glimpse
of
his
face
nor
how
he
was
dressed
but
he
was
tall
and
and
i
think
stooped
a
little
and
walked
with
quite
a
decided
limp
that
last
fact
ought
to
help
to
identify
him
if
nothing
else
mused
phyllis
but
i
confess
i
more
at
sea
than
ever
about
the
whole
thing
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
reduced
things
to
some
kind
of
a
theory
but
this
upsets
everything
and
it
annoys
me
so
to
think
i
always
out
of
it
being
so
far
away
from
curlew
nest
i
do
believe
i
have
to
come
and
spend
my
nights
with
you
or
i
never
be
on
the
scene
of
action
at
the
most
interesting
time
oh
i
wish
you
would
urged
leslie
earnestly
i
really
beginning
to
be
quite
nervous
about
all
this
it
so
uncanny
not
being
able
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
aunt
marcia
or
any
one
being
all
alone
there
or
as
good
as
alone
when
these
queer
things
happen
do
you
suppose
we
could
arrange
it
somehow
that
you
could
come
over
and
stay
with
me
without
having
it
seem
odd
or
out
of
the
way
to
the
others
they
both
thought
hard
over
the
problem
for
a
moment
suddenly
phyllis
cried
i
have
it
i
think
i
heard
father
and
ted
planning
to
be
off
fishing
and
as
many
nights
after
as
the
conditions
are
good
they
just
adore
that
kind
of
thing
and
have
done
very
little
of
it
this
time
as
a
rule
i
do
mind
a
bit
staying
alone
at
the
bungalow
if
i
do
happen
to
go
with
them
but
i
never
before
had
the
excuse
of
having
you
here
to
be
with
it
will
seem
perfectly
natural
for
me
to
say
that
as
they
to
be
away
i
spend
the
night
with
you
how
that
oh
just
the
thing
exclaimed
leslie
enthusiastically
and
now
go
back
and
take
a
swim
it
fairly
mild
and
the
best
time
of
day
for
it
you
left
your
suit
at
our
house
last
time
so
it
very
convenient
you
wo
have
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
your
place
they
strolled
back
to
rest
haven
in
a
leisurely
fashion
and
had
just
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
come
in
sight
of
the
front
veranda
when
what
they
saw
there
almost
took
them
off
their
feet
on
the
veranda
sat
aunt
marcia
rocking
comfortably
back
and
forth
and
opposite
her
in
another
rocker
sat
could
their
eyes
have
deceived
them
who
but
the
redoubtable
ramsay
she
was
dressed
as
they
had
seen
her
in
the
village
store
and
she
was
chatting
with
an
appearance
of
the
greatest
affability
with
miss
marcia
the
two
girls
stared
at
her
in
amazement
so
in
fact
that
even
miss
marcia
noticed
it
miss
ramsay
and
i
have
been
getting
acquainted
while
we
waited
for
you
to
come
back
she
remarked
somewhat
bewildered
by
their
speechless
consternation
she
says
she
made
your
acquaintance
at
aunt
sally
in
the
village
where
she
is
boarding
oh
er
yes
stuttered
phyllis
remembering
her
manners
it
very
pleasant
to
see
you
here
miss
ramsay
i
see
you
are
acquainted
with
miss
crane
this
is
miss
leslie
crane
her
niece
leslie
bowed
and
murmured
something
inarticulate
but
miss
ramsay
was
affable
to
a
degree
i
drove
over
to
your
cottage
first
miss
kelvin
she
chatted
on
after
her
introduction
with
some
eggs
aunt
sally
promised
you
she
was
going
to
send
them
by
the
butcher
boy
but
he
did
not
stop
this
morning
so
as
i
was
going
out
i
offered
to
take
them
but
i
found
no
one
at
your
place
so
i
came
on
here
introduced
myself
to
miss
crane
and
we
been
having
a
nice
time
together
the
astonishment
of
the
girls
at
this
amazing
change
of
front
in
the
difficult
miss
ramsay
was
beyond
all
expression
her
intonation
was
slightly
english
her
manner
charming
they
had
not
dreamed
that
she
could
be
so
attractive
and
so
fresh
and
pretty
was
she
that
she
was
a
real
delight
to
look
upon
what
delightful
little
cottages
these
are
she
went
on
they
look
so
attractive
from
the
outside
i
sure
they
must
be
equally
so
from
the
inside
we
have
nothing
quite
on
this
style
in
england
where
i
came
from
would
you
like
to
go
through
ours
asked
miss
marcia
hospitably
leslie
take
miss
ramsay
through
perhaps
she
will
be
interested
to
see
the
interior
oh
i
be
delighted
exclaimed
miss
ramsay
and
rose
to
accompany
leslie
it
did
not
take
them
long
to
make
the
round
of
rest
haven
rather
to
her
hostess
astonishment
the
girl
seemed
more
enthusiastic
over
room
than
any
of
the
others
and
lingered
there
the
longest
though
it
was
by
no
means
the
most
attractive
what
a
wonderful
view
you
have
of
the
sea
she
said
and
then
she
strolled
to
the
other
window
and
looked
out
long
and
curiously
an
interesting
little
cottage
next
door
she
remarked
presently
is
it
is
it
just
like
this
one
why
no
it
larger
and
differently
arranged
and
furnished
more
elaborately
too
i
i
believe
faltered
leslie
hoping
she
had
not
appeared
to
know
too
much
about
it
i
wonder
if
we
could
go
through
it
went
on
the
visitor
i
i
just
love
to
see
what
these
little
seashore
places
look
like
they
so
different
from
ours
oh
i
hardly
think
so
cried
leslie
you
see
it
all
locked
up
for
the
winter
and
danforth
who
owns
it
has
the
key
the
girl
looked
at
her
intently
and
there
no
other
way
i
suppose
beside
the
front
door
how
should
i
know
countered
leslie
suddenly
on
her
guard
if
there
would
it
be
right
to
try
it
do
you
think
would
it
be
too
much
like
trespassing
oh
of
course
laughed
miss
ramsay
i
only
meant
that
it
would
be
fun
to
look
it
over
if
there
were
any
proper
way
of
doing
so
you
see
grandfather
and
i
might
be
here
another
summer
and
i
just
love
to
rent
a
little
cottage
like
either
one
of
these
two
she
turned
away
from
the
window
and
they
sauntered
out
of
the
room
and
back
to
the
veranda
and
now
that
you
seen
leslie
bungalow
you
must
run
over
and
see
ours
especially
as
it
was
at
ours
you
at
first
intended
to
call
said
phyllis
come
along
leslie
and
we
show
miss
ramsay
over
luck
it
struck
the
girls
that
miss
ramsay
showed
a
trifle
less
enthusiasm
about
returning
to
the
other
cottage
still
she
agreed
with
a
fair
assumption
of
polite
interest
and
they
tramped
back
along
the
beach
chatting
agreeably
but
she
showed
very
genuine
pleasure
in
the
entirely
different
appearance
of
phyllis
abode
and
a
large
surprise
at
the
presence
of
a
grand
piano
in
so
unusual
a
place
and
when
leslie
had
informed
her
of
talent
she
eagerly
demanded
that
they
be
given
an
immediate
concert
and
it
was
phyllis
sudden
whim
to
render
a
very
charming
and
touching
program
ending
with
the
chopin
berceuse
the
music
died
away
in
a
hushed
chord
and
leslie
who
had
been
gazing
out
at
the
ocean
during
its
rendering
was
astonished
when
she
looked
around
to
see
the
visitor
furtively
wiping
away
a
few
tears
i
a
perfect
goose
about
some
kinds
of
music
she
muttered
apologetically
and
then
abruptly
wo
you
two
girls
please
call
me
eileen
i
so
lonely
here
and
i
have
any
friends
and
and
i
like
to
see
you
often
and
then
the
impulsive
phyllis
put
a
comradely
arm
about
her
shoulder
just
come
as
often
as
you
like
we
always
be
delighted
to
see
you
i
sure
we
three
can
have
a
jolly
time
together
and
be
sure
to
call
us
by
our
first
names
too
thank
you
phyllis
and
leslie
she
said
simply
you
are
more
than
kind
to
me
but
i
must
be
getting
back
now
it
most
time
for
me
to
go
to
the
hospital
to
see
grandfather
he
ill
and
i
so
worried
about
him
again
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
but
i
coming
over
with
the
car
to
take
you
all
out
for
a
spin
and
she
was
gone
running
down
the
path
to
where
she
had
parked
the
car
when
they
were
alone
the
two
girls
looked
at
one
another
it
the
most
amazing
thing
i
ever
heard
of
this
change
in
her
marveled
phyllis
have
you
the
slightest
idea
what
has
caused
it
i
think
i
have
answered
leslie
and
she
told
of
the
girl
curious
conduct
when
she
was
being
shown
through
rest
haven
i
believe
she
had
a
purpose
in
coming
here
she
may
have
thought
she
could
find
out
something
from
us
and
she
certainly
thought
she
might
get
into
curlew
nest
though
i
do
believe
for
a
minute
the
reason
she
gave
was
the
only
one
i
think
she
did
particularly
want
to
go
to
see
your
place
either
but
when
she
got
here
she
liked
it
yes
and
i
like
her
strange
as
you
may
think
it
declared
phyllis
i
quite
changed
my
mind
about
her
do
you
know
i
think
that
girl
is
having
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
somehow
or
other
trouble
she
ca
tell
us
about
what
the
mystery
is
and
how
it
is
connected
with
that
cottage
i
do
see
but
i
do
believe
that
she
likes
and
if
we
ever
going
to
solve
this
mystery
at
all
it
will
probably
be
through
her
shall
we
do
you
think
we
ought
to
give
her
the
dragon
secret
faltered
leslie
i
certainly
do
at
least
not
yet
i
wait
till
i
know
a
few
things
more
before
i
make
a
move
like
that
declared
the
emphatic
phyllis
and
now
come
along
and
let
have
our
swim
chapter
xii
the
curious
behavior
of
ted
true
to
their
previous
arrangement
phyllis
spent
the
night
with
leslie
at
rest
haven
they
read
together
till
a
very
late
hour
and
then
sat
up
even
later
in
the
dark
watching
from
leslie
window
to
see
if
there
were
any
further
developments
at
curlew
nest
but
nothing
unusual
happened
is
that
exactly
my
luck
complained
phyllis
if
i
were
here
i
suppose
there
be
a
half
a
dozen
spooky
visitors
oh
no
laughed
leslie
probably
nothing
will
happen
again
for
some
time
remember
how
very
few
times
it
happened
anyway
but
it
is
provoking
just
when
we
all
ready
for
it
do
you
know
exclaimed
phyllis
suddenly
this
is
the
time
when
just
love
to
go
through
that
place
again
what
do
you
say
if
we
get
out
of
this
window
and
try
it
oh
no
no
cried
leslie
you
must
think
of
such
a
thing
ca
you
see
how
awfully
dangerous
it
would
be
just
suppose
some
one
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
visit
the
place
again
and
find
us
in
there
it
would
be
a
terrible
position
for
us
i
would
be
afraid
of
eileen
stoutly
declared
phyllis
i
rather
enjoy
meeting
her
there
it
would
give
her
something
to
explain
but
there
some
one
else
you
might
meet
there
who
might
not
be
so
amusing
the
man
with
the
limp
leslie
reminded
her
phyllis
had
to
acknowledge
that
this
was
so
and
the
subject
was
dropped
much
to
leslie
relief
next
afternoon
eileen
came
over
with
her
car
and
invited
the
girls
and
miss
marcia
to
go
for
a
long
ride
they
all
accepted
with
alacrity
enjoying
the
prospect
of
a
change
eileen
insisted
that
miss
marcia
sit
by
her
while
she
drove
and
as
she
did
this
with
remarkable
ease
she
was
able
to
converse
pleasantly
with
her
guests
most
of
the
time
she
took
them
for
a
very
long
drive
and
they
were
all
astonished
at
her
familiarity
with
the
roads
in
that
part
of
the
country
she
assured
them
that
she
had
grown
to
know
them
well
during
the
long
days
lately
when
she
had
little
else
to
do
than
to
explore
them
with
the
car
it
was
dusk
when
they
returned
at
last
to
the
beach
and
having
deposited
phyllis
first
at
her
bungalow
eileen
drove
the
others
to
theirs
they
bade
her
good
night
at
the
foot
of
the
wooden
path
that
led
up
the
slope
to
their
cottage
and
she
sat
and
watched
them
without
starting
the
car
till
they
had
disappeared
indoors
but
it
so
happened
that
leslie
turned
around
opened
the
door
and
came
out
again
almost
at
once
to
get
an
armful
of
wood
for
the
fire
from
the
bin
on
the
back
veranda
and
in
so
doing
it
happened
also
that
she
witnessed
a
curious
little
incident
eileen
seemed
to
have
had
a
slight
difficulty
in
starting
the
car
but
it
was
in
motion
now
going
slowly
and
had
advanced
only
about
as
far
as
the
path
leading
up
to
curlew
nest
leslie
stood
in
the
darkness
of
her
porch
idly
watching
its
progress
when
something
that
happened
caused
her
heart
to
leap
into
her
throat
out
from
some
thick
bushes
at
the
edge
of
the
road
there
appeared
a
dark
form
which
signaled
to
the
car
eileen
whirled
the
wheel
around
applied
the
brake
and
the
car
almost
came
to
a
stop
almost
but
not
quite
for
the
figure
leaped
into
it
while
it
was
still
going
then
eileen
stepped
on
the
accelerator
the
car
shot
forward
and
was
almost
instantly
out
of
sight
illustration
eileen
whirled
the
wheel
around
applied
the
brake
and
the
car
almost
came
to
a
stop
leslie
got
her
wood
and
went
indoors
in
a
daze
what
could
it
all
mean
what
duplicity
had
eileen
been
guilty
of
now
the
thing
certainly
looked
very
very
sinister
consider
it
how
you
would
and
she
could
breathe
no
word
of
it
to
her
aunt
who
as
leslie
entered
straightway
began
on
a
long
eulogy
of
eileen
her
delightful
manners
her
thoughtfulness
and
her
kindness
in
giving
them
an
afternoon
of
such
enjoyment
it
seemed
to
leslie
considering
what
had
just
happened
that
she
must
certainly
scream
with
nervousness
if
miss
marcia
did
not
stop
and
she
tried
vainly
several
times
to
steer
her
to
another
theme
but
miss
marcia
had
found
a
topic
that
interested
her
and
she
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
it
till
it
was
exhausted
with
all
her
strength
leslie
longed
for
the
time
to
come
when
phyllis
should
appear
for
she
had
promised
to
come
again
for
the
night
and
when
the
supper
was
eaten
and
the
dishes
had
been
disposed
of
leslie
went
outside
and
paced
and
paced
back
and
forth
on
the
front
veranda
peering
vainly
into
the
darkness
to
watch
for
her
friend
miss
marcia
indoors
with
rags
by
the
blazing
fire
called
several
times
to
her
to
come
in
and
share
the
warmth
and
comfort
but
she
felt
she
could
not
endure
the
confinement
in
the
house
and
the
peaceful
sitting
by
the
hearth
when
her
thoughts
were
so
upset
would
phyllis
never
appear
what
could
be
keeping
her
it
was
a
small
but
very
active
indignation
meeting
that
was
held
when
the
two
girls
were
at
last
together
leslie
would
not
permit
phyllis
to
go
indoors
for
a
time
after
she
arrived
though
the
night
was
rather
chilly
but
kept
her
on
the
veranda
to
explain
what
had
happened
the
deceitful
little
thing
cried
phyllis
now
i
see
exactly
what
she
took
us
all
out
for
this
afternoon
even
miss
marcia
to
get
rid
of
us
all
for
a
good
long
time
while
some
accomplice
of
hers
did
what
they
pleased
in
curlew
nest
quite
undisturbed
by
any
one
around
that
exactly
what
it
must
have
been
agreed
leslie
but
who
could
that
other
person
have
been
the
man
with
the
limp
suggested
phyllis
no
i
very
sure
it
was
not
he
this
person
sprang
into
the
car
while
it
was
still
in
motion
was
very
active
evidently
i
certain
the
man
with
the
limp
could
never
have
done
that
well
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
surely
you
could
tell
no
actually
i
could
it
was
getting
so
dark
and
the
figure
was
so
far
off
and
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
i
could
see
but
phyllis
i
horribly
disappointed
in
eileen
i
had
begun
to
think
she
was
lovely
and
that
we
had
misjudged
her
badly
and
now
she
simply
us
that
plain
agreed
phyllis
she
evidently
intended
to
do
so
from
the
first
after
she
found
out
we
were
right
on
the
spot
here
she
deliberately
came
out
to
cultivate
our
acquaintance
and
make
it
seem
natural
for
her
to
be
around
here
then
she
and
the
one
she
working
with
planned
to
get
us
away
from
here
for
the
whole
afternoon
and
have
the
field
free
for
anything
they
pleased
faugh
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
being
duped
like
that
but
after
yesterday
and
the
way
she
acted
when
you
played
chopin
and
what
she
said
about
our
friendship
and
all
that
was
genuine
at
all
not
a
thing
declared
phyllis
positively
all
put
on
to
get
a
little
farther
into
our
good
graces
well
i
never
be
caught
like
again
we
continue
to
seem
very
friendly
to
miss
eileen
ramsay
but
we
wo
be
caught
twice
by
the
way
what
made
you
so
late
questioned
leslie
suddenly
changing
the
subject
i
thought
you
never
come
oh
i
meant
to
tell
you
right
away
but
all
this
put
it
out
of
my
head
when
i
got
home
after
the
ride
i
found
only
father
there
he
said
ted
had
been
away
most
of
the
afternoon
he
gone
down
to
the
village
after
some
new
and
had
come
back
yet
i
started
in
and
got
supper
and
still
he
did
appear
then
we
began
to
get
worried
and
down
to
smithson
in
the
village
where
they
sell
tackle
to
see
if
he
could
be
there
they
said
he
been
early
in
the
afternoon
but
they
had
seen
him
since
we
called
up
every
other
place
he
could
possibly
be
but
nowhere
was
he
to
be
found
i
was
beginning
to
be
quite
upset
about
him
when
in
he
walked
he
was
very
quiet
and
uncommunicative
and
would
explain
why
he
was
so
late
and
then
presently
he
said
in
a
very
casual
manner
that
his
hand
was
hurt
and
when
he
showed
it
to
us
i
almost
screamed
for
it
was
very
badly
hurt
all
torn
and
lacerated
he
had
it
wrapped
in
his
handkerchief
but
we
made
him
undo
it
and
i
bathed
it
and
father
put
iodine
on
and
i
fixed
him
a
sling
to
wear
it
in
the
thing
about
it
was
that
he
did
seem
to
want
to
tell
us
how
it
happened
said
he
met
a
friend
who
invited
him
to
ride
in
their
car
and
had
taken
him
for
a
long
drive
and
on
the
way
home
they
had
a
little
breakdown
and
ted
had
tried
to
help
fix
it
and
had
got
his
hand
caught
in
the
machinery
somehow
but
he
was
plainly
very
anxious
not
to
be
questioned
about
it
and
father
says
that
ted
is
old
enough
now
to
be
trusted
and
should
not
be
compelled
to
speak
when
he
does
wish
to
and
so
nothing
more
was
said
but
it
all
seemed
a
little
strange
to
me
for
honestly
i
do
know
a
single
soul
in
this
village
that
ted
knows
who
owns
a
car
or
any
other
of
our
friends
who
would
be
likely
to
be
around
these
parts
just
now
they
all
home
at
their
schools
or
colleges
when
i
asked
him
whose
car
he
was
in
he
just
glared
at
me
and
said
i
always
did
ask
too
many
impertinent
questions
but
i
ca
make
much
out
of
it
and
i
hate
any
more
puzzles
to
think
about
leslie
however
could
cast
no
light
on
this
new
problem
and
she
was
somewhat
more
interested
moreover
in
their
other
puzzle
but
as
she
was
about
to
revert
to
that
subject
again
phyllis
suddenly
interrupted
oh
by
the
way
soon
after
i
got
home
aunt
sally
to
ask
if
we
were
back
from
the
ride
yet
and
when
i
said
we
been
back
some
time
she
said
she
was
quite
worried
because
eileen
had
not
yet
appeared
and
it
was
late
and
dark
i
said
perhaps
she
had
stopped
somewhere
in
the
village
as
she
had
left
us
a
good
while
before
quite
a
little
later
just
before
ted
got
in
aunt
sally
again
to
say
that
eileen
had
just
arrived
she
had
some
trouble
with
the
car
after
she
left
us
and
had
to
stop
and
fix
it
i
wonder
what
was
the
matter
suddenly
leslie
clutched
her
friend
arm
phyllis
kelvin
are
we
going
crazy
or
is
there
some
strange
connection
in
all
this
ca
you
see
ted
late
and
mixed
up
with
some
breakdown
eileen
late
and
had
trouble
with
the
machinery
and
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
some
one
jump
into
her
car
could
it
it
be
possible
that
person
was
phyllis
stared
at
her
as
if
she
thought
leslie
certainly
gone
crazy
there
not
the
slightest
chance
in
the
world
she
declared
positively
why
only
last
night
when
i
was
explaining
to
ted
about
eileen
and
how
we
become
friends
all
he
said
was
so
taken
up
with
some
other
dame
have
you
might
as
well
not
have
brought
you
down
here
all
the
good
you
are
to
this
time
have
been
fishing
with
us
more
than
twice
since
we
came
whoever
this
eileen
is
do
for
goodness
sake
have
her
around
here
if
he
known
her
he
certainly
would
have
shown
it
in
some
way
he
acted
utterly
disgusted
with
me
for
having
made
her
acquaintance
that
may
all
be
true
but
it
does
prove
that
is
not
acquainted
with
her
stubbornly
affirmed
leslie
and
phyllis
was
driven
to
acknowledge
the
force
of
the
argument
chapter
xiii
a
trap
is
set
they
went
indoors
at
last
and
tried
to
settle
down
to
reading
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
distract
their
minds
from
disturbing
thoughts
miss
marcia
retired
early
as
the
ride
had
tired
her
and
they
were
left
to
their
own
devices
at
length
they
gave
up
the
attempt
to
read
and
sat
talking
in
whispers
over
the
dying
fire
when
there
was
nothing
left
but
ashes
leslie
suggested
with
a
shiver
that
they
go
to
bed
and
they
withdrew
to
leslie
room
needless
to
say
they
did
go
to
bed
at
once
but
sat
long
by
the
side
window
staring
across
at
curlew
nest
and
it
was
then
that
phyllis
suddenly
had
her
great
idea
now
see
here
leslie
crane
i
have
an
idea
and
i
going
to
do
something
and
i
do
want
you
to
interfere
with
me
do
you
understand
what
do
you
mean
whispered
leslie
looking
alarmed
i
mean
just
this
you
going
to
stay
right
where
you
are
with
rags
and
keep
watch
and
i
going
to
get
out
of
the
window
and
go
over
and
explore
curlew
nest
by
myself
phyllis
are
you
crazy
implored
leslie
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
things
you
could
do
nothing
of
the
sort
it
safer
than
it
would
be
almost
any
other
time
because
ca
you
see
some
one
has
evidently
been
here
all
the
afternoon
when
the
coast
was
entirely
clear
and
no
doubt
done
all
they
wish
to
do
there
for
day
anyhow
there
a
better
time
than
this
very
night
for
there
not
one
chance
in
a
hundred
that
they
be
back
again
but
just
suppose
the
hundredth
chance
did
happen
what
would
you
do
argued
leslie
in
despair
do
i
shout
like
everything
to
you
to
turn
rags
loose
and
call
up
the
village
constable
and
father
or
better
yet
i
blow
this
police
whistle
which
father
always
insists
on
my
carrying
so
that
i
can
call
them
in
to
meals
when
they
down
on
the
beach
if
you
hear
just
start
things
going
that
why
i
leaving
you
and
rags
here
on
guard
oh
i
do
like
it
i
do
like
it
at
all
moaned
leslie
it
would
be
so
bad
if
you
only
met
eileen
there
but
you
ca
tell
whom
you
might
encounter
i
believe
there
something
more
dangerous
and
desperate
about
this
affair
than
either
of
us
have
guessed
i
do
know
why
i
think
so
it
just
come
to
me
lately
it
a
sort
of
presentiment
i
ca
seem
to
shake
off
nonsense
declared
phyllis
not
to
be
balked
if
i
met
any
one
there
it
could
only
be
eileen
and
she
the
one
i
crazy
to
encounter
after
the
way
she
has
treated
us
i
have
a
few
things
to
say
to
that
young
person
for
trespassing
on
danforth
property
danforth
has
always
asked
that
we
keep
an
eye
on
these
cottages
of
hers
while
here
it
an
understood
thing
between
us
so
i
be
entirely
within
my
rights
in
going
in
there
to
look
the
place
over
especially
if
i
suspected
anything
queer
and
the
other
person
would
be
quite
in
the
wrong
do
you
see
oh
yes
i
see
that
but
it
does
lessen
the
fact
that
it
may
be
dangerous
sighed
leslie
wearily
phyllis
ignored
this
if
the
hundredth
chance
should
happen
and
i
encounter
eileen
or
if
i
come
across
anything
very
unusual
and
think
you
ought
to
see
it
i
let
you
know
only
in
case
of
the
hundred
and
chance
of
real
danger
will
i
blow
this
whistle
hold
on
tight
to
rags
and
do
let
him
try
to
follow
me
see
you
later
and
before
leslie
could
expostulate
further
she
had
slipped
out
of
the
window
her
electric
torch
in
her
hand
and
was
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
of
the
neighboring
cottage
leslie
remained
half
hanging
out
of
the
window
in
an
agony
of
suspense
the
night
was
moonless
and
very
dark
added
to
that
a
heavy
hung
over
everything
like
a
blanket
and
out
of
the
gloom
the
steady
pounding
of
the
surf
came
to
her
with
ominous
insistence
the
chill
of
the
foggy
air
was
penetrating
and
she
wrapped
a
sweater
about
her
almost
without
realizing
that
she
had
done
so
rags
was
on
the
seat
beside
her
ears
alertly
cocked
there
was
not
a
sound
from
the
next
house
nor
could
she
even
see
a
single
gleam
of
light
from
the
chinks
in
the
shutters
where
could
phyllis
be
surely
there
had
been
time
enough
for
her
to
have
entered
the
place
looked
about
and
come
out
again
what
could
she
be
doing
then
her
brain
began
to
be
filled
with
horrible
pictures
of
all
the
possible
and
impossible
things
that
might
have
happened
so
beyond
all
bearing
did
this
feature
become
at
length
that
she
came
to
the
sudden
conclusion
she
would
endure
it
no
longer
she
would
get
out
of
the
window
herself
and
go
in
search
of
her
friend
if
the
worst
came
to
worst
rags
could
do
some
one
a
pretty
bit
of
damage
she
had
actually
got
as
far
as
to
put
one
foot
over
the
low
sill
when
she
quickly
pulled
it
back
again
a
dark
form
had
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
other
house
and
was
hurrying
toward
her
leslie
leslie
quick
can
you
come
here
with
me
leslie
almost
collapsed
so
swift
was
the
reaction
of
relief
at
hearing
phyllis
voice
after
all
her
terrible
imaginings
what
is
it
what
have
you
found
she
managed
to
reply
i
ca
explain
to
you
here
whispered
phyllis
it
would
take
too
long
come
along
with
me
and
see
for
yourself
it
perfectly
safe
there
not
a
soul
around
i
been
in
the
house
bring
rags
along
it
wo
hurt
there
have
been
queer
doings
here
evidently
you
can
see
it
all
in
five
minutes
do
come
in
spite
of
all
her
previous
fears
the
temptation
was
too
much
for
leslie
if
phyllis
had
examined
the
ground
and
found
it
safe
surely
there
was
no
need
for
fear
and
her
curiosity
to
see
what
her
friend
had
seen
was
now
stronger
than
she
could
resist
she
crept
softly
out
of
the
window
speaking
to
rags
in
a
whisper
and
the
dog
leaped
lightly
out
after
her
they
stole
around
the
corner
of
the
next
house
three
black
shadows
in
the
enveloping
mist
and
not
till
phyllis
had
closed
the
side
door
of
curlew
nest
behind
them
was
a
word
spoken
follow
me
into
the
she
ordered
and
if
you
do
see
something
there
that
surprises
you
i
miss
my
guess
she
switched
on
the
electric
torch
and
leslie
and
rags
followed
after
her
in
solemn
procession
from
what
she
had
said
leslie
expected
to
see
the
place
in
a
terrible
disorder
at
the
very
least
and
was
considerably
surprised
when
she
came
into
the
room
to
observe
nothing
out
of
its
place
in
some
bewilderment
she
looked
about
while
phyllis
stood
by
watching
her
why
what
wrong
she
whispered
everything
seems
to
be
just
as
it
was
look
on
the
commanded
phyllis
and
she
turned
the
torch
full
on
that
article
of
furniture
leslie
tiptoed
over
to
examine
it
then
she
uttered
a
little
cry
on
the
table
was
a
slip
of
paper
not
a
very
large
slip
and
evidently
torn
from
some
larger
sheet
and
on
this
paper
were
a
few
words
she
bent
to
read
them
it
ran
it
is
advisable
that
the
article
stolen
from
its
be
returned
to
it
as
speedily
as
possible
as
otherwise
consequences
most
serious
to
all
parties
concerned
will
result
leslie
turned
deadly
pale
as
she
read
it
and
seized
phyllis
spasmodically
by
the
arm
oh
come
out
of
here
this
moment
she
exclaimed
i
will
not
stay
in
this
house
another
instant
i
told
you
it
was
dangerous
and
she
dragged
her
friend
with
the
strength
of
terror
to
the
side
door
outside
as
the
chill
mist
struck
her
she
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
what
a
little
you
are
laughed
phyllis
what
in
the
world
were
you
frightened
about
leslie
shivered
oh
the
whole
thing
strikes
me
as
too
uncanny
for
words
some
one
has
been
in
here
and
left
that
warning
they
may
be
around
here
now
for
all
you
know
who
do
you
suppose
it
can
be
i
a
very
good
notion
who
it
was
but
it
too
chilly
to
explain
it
standing
here
go
over
to
the
house
with
rags
and
i
be
there
directly
i
want
to
go
back
a
moment
phyllis
phyllis
go
back
there
again
implored
leslie
almost
beside
herself
with
an
alarm
she
could
hardly
explain
what
do
you
want
to
do
never
mind
go
back
i
be
there
in
two
minutes
and
tearing
herself
from
leslie
grasp
phyllis
ran
back
into
the
dark
bungalow
but
leslie
would
not
return
to
her
own
house
and
desert
her
companion
though
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
enter
again
that
place
so
she
lingered
about
outside
in
a
state
of
unenviable
desperation
till
phyllis
once
more
emerged
from
the
dark
doorway
so
you
could
leave
me
after
all
phyllis
laughed
well
come
back
to
bed
now
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
they
were
chilled
through
with
the
drenching
mist
by
the
time
they
returned
and
not
till
they
were
enveloped
in
the
warm
did
phyllis
deign
to
explain
her
ideas
about
the
newest
development
in
their
mystery
you
were
mightily
scared
by
that
little
piece
of
paper
and
i
confess
that
i
was
startled
myself
for
a
minute
but
after
i
thought
it
over
it
suddenly
dawned
on
me
that
there
was
precious
little
to
be
scared
about
and
i
tell
you
why
i
perfectly
convinced
that
that
thing
was
written
and
placed
there
by
my
brother
leslie
sat
up
in
bed
with
a
jerk
you
ca
possibly
mean
it
i
certainly
do
and
here
my
reason
you
yourself
convinced
me
earlier
this
evening
that
there
was
a
chance
of
ted
being
mixed
up
in
this
thing
somehow
i
ca
imagine
how
he
got
into
it
that
a
mystery
past
my
explaining
but
it
looks
very
much
as
if
he
knew
this
eileen
and
that
he
was
poking
around
here
this
afternoon
while
we
were
away
now
he
suspects
that
are
mixed
up
in
it
too
for
he
saw
us
come
out
of
the
bungalow
that
day
well
if
eileen
has
told
him
about
the
dragon
secret
and
its
disappearance
perhaps
he
thinks
we
know
what
happened
to
it
at
any
rate
he
taken
the
chance
and
written
this
warning
for
our
inspection
the
next
time
we
happened
in
he
thinks
it
will
scare
us
i
suppose
he
presently
find
out
that
we
do
scare
for
a
cent
and
i
have
thought
of
a
scheme
as
good
as
his
do
you
know
what
i
did
when
i
went
back
there
i
took
a
pencil
and
on
the
bottom
of
that
paper
just
this
article
will
be
returned
to
its
now
here
what
i
going
to
do
next
in
my
trunk
i
have
a
little
very
much
the
size
and
shape
and
weight
of
the
secret
it
one
of
those
antimony
things
you
often
seen
covered
with
a
kind
of
carving
that
might
easily
pass
for
what
on
that
other
one
if
it
were
i
going
to
make
a
burlap
bag
just
like
the
one
we
found
and
sew
the
in
it
and
it
will
be
a
sharp
person
who
can
tell
the
difference
between
them
till
the
bag
is
opened
then
we
bury
it
in
the
place
where
rags
dug
up
the
other
some
time
when
the
coast
is
clear
after
that
we
wait
and
see
what
happens
next
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
scheme
it
sounds
splendid
to
me
admitted
leslie
then
she
added
uneasily
but
there
something
you
have
explained
yet
you
think
ted
wrote
that
thing
yet
it
is
how
do
you
explain
oh
that
simple
enough
we
have
an
old
typewriter
down
here
that
father
uses
occasionally
and
ted
frequently
practises
on
it
but
did
you
notice
the
paper
leslie
insisted
it
was
queer
thin
almost
stuff
do
you
folks
use
that
kind
or
happen
to
have
it
about
oh
i
do
know
i
suppose
he
got
it
somewhere
what
does
it
matter
anyway
answered
phyllis
sleepily
and
in
two
minutes
more
she
was
in
the
land
of
dreams
but
leslie
still
unconvinced
tossed
the
night
through
without
closing
her
eyes
chapter
xiv
the
man
with
the
limp
two
days
had
passed
to
leslie
it
was
a
constant
marvel
considering
the
secret
tension
under
which
she
lived
that
outwardly
her
life
went
on
in
the
same
peaceful
groove
she
rose
and
dressed
as
usual
prepared
the
meals
ate
and
chatted
with
aunt
marcia
walked
on
the
beach
or
down
to
the
village
fished
occasionally
with
phyllis
and
the
kelvins
took
a
dip
in
the
ocean
when
it
was
not
too
chilly
read
and
slept
and
idled
as
if
there
were
nothing
in
the
world
but
what
was
quiet
and
normal
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
aunt
marcia
suspected
nothing
even
ted
who
she
was
certain
suspected
many
things
laughed
and
chatted
with
and
teased
her
and
never
by
so
much
as
a
word
or
look
indicated
the
slightest
suspicion
of
her
interest
in
curlew
nest
and
its
affairs
with
phyllis
his
manner
was
somewhat
different
and
during
the
last
two
days
their
relations
had
seemed
occasionally
rather
strained
but
there
was
no
open
break
in
public
at
least
but
at
home
it
another
matter
phyllis
assured
her
something
come
over
him
i
ca
guess
what
he
will
hardly
speak
either
to
father
or
myself
he
does
even
want
to
play
his
violin
when
we
get
together
and
usually
he
adores
that
he
moody
and
silent
and
just
most
of
the
time
and
that
unusual
for
ted
i
give
him
credit
for
being
a
pretty
amiable
fellow
as
a
rule
i
ca
make
him
out
and
it
surely
is
queer
that
we
seen
nothing
more
of
eileen
do
you
think
so
questioned
leslie
well
no
considering
that
she
gained
her
point
and
got
us
away
all
that
afternoon
i
do
think
it
at
all
queer
she
done
with
us
now
why
should
she
try
to
keep
on
with
it
by
the
way
i
called
her
up
at
aunt
sally
last
night
she
was
there
but
aunt
sally
said
her
grandfather
has
been
rather
worse
for
the
last
two
days
and
she
been
at
the
hospital
most
of
the
time
was
there
then
all
of
which
may
or
may
not
be
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
guess
aunt
sally
knows
precious
little
of
her
doings
when
she
away
in
that
car
somehow
leslie
could
never
believe
eileen
quite
as
full
of
duplicity
as
phyllis
thought
her
while
she
had
to
admit
that
circumstances
made
the
girl
conduct
seem
almost
inexcusable
there
always
lingered
in
her
mind
a
stubborn
feeling
that
perhaps
there
was
more
back
of
it
all
than
they
know
that
eileen
herself
might
be
struggling
with
entangling
problems
and
secretly
she
still
felt
a
liking
for
the
girl
but
she
knew
it
was
useless
to
express
these
doubts
to
phyllis
so
she
wisely
kept
her
own
counsel
but
there
was
one
thing
she
did
allude
to
is
it
strange
that
eileen
never
told
us
a
word
about
her
grandfather
or
how
sick
he
was
or
what
was
the
matter
with
him
you
would
have
thought
it
natural
that
day
when
she
took
us
riding
to
say
about
it
anyway
i
hardly
see
now
how
she
could
have
avoided
it
and
yet
she
did
you
never
have
thought
she
had
such
a
thing
as
a
sick
grandfather
on
her
mind
leslie
you
certainly
are
a
trusting
soul
exclaimed
phyllis
scornfully
how
do
you
know
she
a
sick
grandfather
in
any
hospital
i
strongly
doubt
it
myself
oh
i
believe
she
not
telling
the
truth
about
cried
leslie
thoroughly
shocked
do
you
believe
anything
about
her
any
more
i
do
know
what
i
believe
or
do
believe
about
retorted
phyllis
and
what
more
there
only
one
thing
concerning
her
that
i
interested
in
just
now
whether
she
has
discovered
the
answer
to
that
note
left
in
there
and
when
she
or
any
one
else
is
going
to
make
the
attempt
to
unearth
their
treasure
again
phyllis
had
been
as
good
as
her
word
on
the
morning
after
that
night
of
the
fog
she
had
returned
to
her
bungalow
before
breakfast
and
had
reappeared
later
at
rest
haven
with
a
mysterious
bundle
when
they
had
both
retired
to
leslie
room
she
revealed
its
contents
a
piece
of
burlap
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
one
which
contained
the
secret
and
an
antimony
then
they
got
down
the
original
from
its
dusty
shelf
fashioned
a
bag
the
exact
size
and
shape
of
the
one
rags
had
unearthed
placed
the
in
it
and
sewed
it
up
when
all
was
complete
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
to
tell
the
original
from
its
duplicate
so
nearly
alike
did
they
seem
late
that
afternoon
while
ted
and
his
father
were
far
up
the
inlet
and
with
the
beach
entirely
deserted
they
buried
the
false
in
the
sand
by
the
old
log
phyllis
did
the
deed
while
leslie
scouted
the
beach
in
every
direction
investigated
every
nook
and
corner
that
could
possibly
conceal
any
one
and
made
absolutely
certain
that
they
were
not
observed
and
from
that
time
on
they
had
awaited
results
and
to
their
certain
knowledge
there
had
been
none
each
day
at
some
hour
when
there
was
least
likelihood
of
any
one
being
near
they
had
examined
the
place
only
to
find
the
buried
bag
still
in
its
untouched
at
night
they
had
taken
turns
keeping
watch
all
the
night
through
but
no
stealthy
visitor
had
come
to
curlew
nest
nor
had
there
been
any
during
the
day
of
that
they
were
absolutely
certain
the
beach
had
never
seemed
so
free
of
visitors
before
and
thus
matters
stood
on
the
second
afternoon
and
they
were
beginning
to
be
impatient
at
inaction
and
delay
then
phyllis
had
an
idea
i
know
what
the
matter
she
cried
we
keeping
too
close
a
watch
we
do
give
anybody
a
chance
to
come
within
gunshot
of
that
place
unobserved
so
how
can
we
expect
that
anything
is
going
to
happen
if
it
ted
do
you
suppose
he
sees
us
hanging
about
here
all
the
time
he
be
a
goose
to
try
anything
right
in
front
of
our
eyes
no
doubt
seen
one
or
the
other
of
us
at
the
window
all
night
too
and
if
eileen
or
any
one
else
it
the
same
thing
let
go
off
somewhere
and
give
them
a
chance
not
too
far
though
for
we
want
to
be
where
we
can
get
back
with
reasonable
speed
ourselves
so
they
went
for
a
stroll
along
the
beach
accompanied
by
rags
who
was
only
too
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
an
expedition
that
promised
some
change
it
was
a
mild
hazy
october
afternoon
an
opalescent
mist
lay
along
the
horizon
and
the
waves
rolled
in
lazily
too
lazily
to
break
with
their
accustomed
crash
every
little
while
there
would
be
a
flight
of
wild
geese
in
flying
line
far
overhead
and
their
honking
would
float
down
faintly
as
they
pushed
on
in
their
southward
course
it
was
a
golden
afternoon
and
leslie
almost
resented
the
fact
that
they
had
any
worries
or
problems
on
their
minds
why
who
in
the
world
is
that
exclaimed
phyllis
suddenly
as
they
rounded
a
slight
curve
in
the
beach
and
came
in
sight
of
a
figure
standing
at
the
water
edge
a
rod
and
long
line
in
his
hand
and
a
and
beside
him
there
has
been
a
stranger
fishing
in
this
region
in
an
age
people
generally
go
down
by
the
big
bungalow
colony
three
miles
farther
along
for
that
we
almost
never
see
any
one
here
i
wonder
what
it
means
as
they
came
nearer
they
could
see
more
plainly
what
sort
of
person
he
appeared
to
be
he
was
tall
and
stalwart
and
a
slouch
hat
was
pulled
down
to
shade
his
eyes
but
still
they
could
see
that
his
face
was
alert
and
kindly
and
placid
with
twinkling
gray
eyes
and
a
whimsical
mouth
he
was
obviously
an
adept
fisherman
as
phyllis
remarked
when
they
had
witnessed
the
clever
way
in
which
he
managed
a
catch
they
were
very
near
him
by
that
time
and
watching
breathlessly
once
his
prey
almost
eluded
him
but
with
a
skilful
manipulation
of
his
tackle
he
presently
brought
the
big
fellow
lashing
wildly
to
land
well
out
of
reach
of
the
water
great
scott
he
exclaimed
winding
up
his
line
but
that
fellow
gave
me
a
warm
ten
minutes
the
girls
had
by
this
time
reached
the
spot
and
were
admiring
the
catch
congratulations
laughed
phyllis
with
the
informal
interest
of
the
born
fisherman
i
could
have
done
it
myself
not
after
he
had
almost
escaped
he
must
weigh
five
pounds
the
stranger
looked
at
them
with
interest
so
you
fish
well
it
the
best
sport
in
the
world
this
bouncer
has
been
dodging
me
all
the
afternoon
and
i
vowed
i
get
him
before
i
left
almost
had
him
once
before
but
he
got
away
with
the
bait
would
let
me
alone
though
even
after
that
i
warned
him
he
was
flirting
with
his
fate
and
he
laughed
a
big
booming
pleasant
laugh
at
this
moment
rags
who
had
been
elsewhere
occupied
came
bounding
up
and
straightway
made
a
over
to
investigate
the
fish
hi
stop
that
exclaimed
the
stranger
i
intend
to
have
that
fish
for
my
supper
and
he
made
a
dash
for
his
cherished
trophy
but
rags
disconcerted
by
the
sudden
movement
was
on
his
guard
at
once
as
the
man
approached
he
sank
his
teeth
into
the
fish
with
a
growl
that
was
a
warning
not
to
be
ignored
oh
call
him
off
cried
the
man
anxiously
and
leslie
very
much
upset
sprang
forward
to
rescue
the
stranger
dinner
but
rags
saw
a
chance
for
a
lark
and
as
times
had
been
rather
slow
and
uninteresting
for
him
of
late
he
determined
to
make
the
most
of
it
seizing
the
fish
in
a
firm
grip
he
galloped
madly
up
the
beach
the
two
girls
wildly
pursuing
there
ensued
a
chase
very
similar
to
the
one
he
had
led
them
on
that
eventful
day
when
he
had
unearthed
the
dragon
secret
never
once
did
he
allow
them
to
lay
a
finger
on
his
prize
though
panting
and
disgusted
they
pursued
him
hither
and
yon
sometimes
so
close
that
he
was
well
within
their
reach
sometimes
with
him
far
in
advance
occasionally
he
would
lie
down
with
the
fish
between
his
paws
fairly
inviting
them
to
come
and
help
themselves
which
they
had
no
sooner
attempted
than
he
was
up
and
away
again
the
man
wisely
took
no
part
in
the
struggle
but
stood
looking
on
encouraging
them
with
remarks
at
length
leslie
had
an
inspiration
while
rags
was
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
water
panting
from
a
long
and
furious
run
the
fish
reposing
at
his
feet
she
seized
a
small
board
lying
near
called
to
him
beguilingly
and
hurled
the
board
out
into
the
sea
here
was
a
game
that
was
even
more
fascinating
rags
always
adored
it
forsaking
the
fish
he
leaped
into
the
lazy
waves
and
swam
out
toward
his
new
prize
while
the
stranger
eagerly
seized
the
fish
and
concealed
it
in
his
basket
oh
i
so
sorry
apologized
leslie
i
know
he
has
spoiled
it
now
i
hope
you
can
forgive
us
for
this
dreadful
thing
nothing
of
the
sort
laughed
the
stranger
he
has
harmed
it
a
bit
for
it
was
only
the
head
he
had
hold
of
when
it
washed
and
cooked
that
beauty
will
taste
just
as
good
as
if
it
had
never
had
the
adventure
my
but
that
a
fearsome
animal
of
yours
i
would
want
to
tackle
him
but
those
english
are
noted
for
being
wonderful
protectors
and
very
interesting
pets
besides
and
just
to
show
that
he
bore
rags
no
malice
he
picked
up
the
board
which
the
dog
had
retrieved
and
obligingly
hurled
it
into
the
surf
again
rags
ecstatically
pursued
it
once
more
dropped
it
at
the
feet
and
begged
for
another
opportunity
but
just
before
it
was
launched
a
third
time
he
spied
a
scuttling
away
almost
under
his
nose
forsook
his
latest
diversion
and
was
off
on
another
hunt
the
man
laughed
dropped
the
wet
sandy
board
dusted
off
his
hands
by
striking
them
together
picked
up
his
hung
his
over
his
arm
bade
the
girls
good
afternoon
and
strode
away
they
gazed
after
him
a
moment
and
were
about
to
turn
back
toward
their
own
part
of
the
beach
when
leslie
suddenly
seized
phyllis
arm
in
a
grip
phyllis
phyllis
do
think
me
crazy
something
has
just
come
to
me
the
way
that
man
threw
the
board
just
now
and
dusted
off
his
hands
and
then
walked
away
was
just
exactly
like
the
with
the
that
morning
at
dawn
the
action
was
identical
i
positive
i
not
mistaken
and
he
looks
just
like
him
the
same
height
and
build
and
all
as
he
walked
away
but
my
dear
child
does
cried
phyllis
conclusively
so
you
certainly
are
mistaken
i
know
he
does
but
i
do
care
he
the
same
one
i
am
absolutely
sure
of
it
maybe
he
all
over
the
limp
now
but
though
leslie
was
so
certain
phyllis
remained
unconvinced
chapter
xv
out
of
the
hurricane
with
the
fickleness
of
october
weather
which
is
often
as
freakish
as
that
of
april
the
golden
afternoon
had
turned
cloudy
and
raw
before
the
girls
returned
home
by
nightfall
it
was
raining
and
a
rising
gusty
wind
had
ruffled
the
ocean
into
lumpy
waves
at
seven
the
wind
had
increased
to
a
heavy
gale
and
was
steadily
growing
stronger
the
threatened
storm
as
usual
filled
miss
marcia
with
nervous
forebodings
and
even
leslie
experienced
some
uncomfortable
apprehensions
during
their
supper
hour
at
eight
phyllis
arrived
escorted
by
ted
my
she
exclaimed
shaking
the
raindrops
from
her
clothes
as
she
stood
on
the
porch
but
this
is
going
to
be
a
night
father
says
the
papers
have
warnings
that
we
should
probably
get
the
of
a
west
indian
hurricane
that
was
headed
this
way
and
i
guess
it
has
come
it
getting
worse
every
minute
have
you
seen
how
the
tide
is
rising
get
on
your
things
and
come
down
to
the
beach
ted
brought
me
because
i
could
hardly
stand
up
against
the
wind
he
going
back
presently
come
and
see
how
the
water
is
rising
oh
hush
implored
leslie
glancing
nervously
toward
her
aunt
no
idea
how
upset
aunt
marcia
is
already
she
whispered
she
be
distracted
if
she
gets
an
idea
there
any
danger
forgive
me
returned
phyllis
contritely
i
really
did
think
for
a
moment
father
says
there
probably
is
any
real
danger
the
tide
has
almost
never
risen
as
far
as
these
bungalows
except
in
winter
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
we
can
always
get
out
of
them
and
walk
away
but
this
threatens
to
be
the
worst
storm
of
the
kind
we
had
in
years
are
you
coming
down
to
see
the
water
if
aunt
marcia
does
mind
but
if
she
afraid
to
be
left
alone
i
wo
oh
ted
will
be
here
and
we
just
run
down
for
a
minute
or
two
really
a
great
sight
ted
very
thoughtfully
offered
to
stay
and
the
two
girls
wrapped
to
the
eyes
pushed
through
the
blinding
rain
and
wind
down
to
where
the
breakers
were
pounding
their
way
up
the
beach
spreading
when
they
broke
farther
and
farther
inland
so
terrific
was
the
impact
of
the
wind
that
the
girls
had
to
turn
their
backs
to
it
when
they
wanted
to
speak
i
brought
you
out
here
as
much
as
anything
because
i
had
something
to
say
shouted
phyllis
her
voice
scarcely
audible
to
the
girl
close
beside
her
if
the
tide
keeps
on
like
this
it
will
probably
wash
away
what
we
hidden
by
the
old
log
and
probably
others
who
are
concerned
with
that
may
be
thinking
of
the
same
thing
we
got
to
keep
a
close
watch
i
believe
things
are
going
to
happen
but
do
you
think
we
better
dig
it
up
ourselves
right
away
suggested
leslie
we
ca
very
well
go
out
to
do
it
later
when
it
may
be
necessary
and
surely
you
want
to
save
it
certainly
declared
phyllis
i
do
care
if
it
washed
away
what
i
want
is
the
fun
of
seeing
the
other
parties
breaking
their
necks
to
rescue
it
if
it
washed
away
they
think
the
real
article
has
disappeared
and
then
we
see
what
next
let
take
one
more
look
at
the
surf
and
then
go
back
they
peered
out
for
a
moment
into
the
blackness
where
an
angry
ocean
was
eating
into
the
beach
then
battling
back
against
the
wind
they
returned
to
the
house
ted
having
ascertained
that
there
was
no
further
service
he
could
render
suggested
that
he
had
better
go
back
and
help
his
father
stop
a
leak
in
the
roof
of
fisherman
luck
which
had
suddenly
proved
unseaworthy
i
so
glad
phyllis
will
be
with
us
miss
marcia
told
him
for
i
very
little
company
for
leslie
at
a
time
like
this
i
get
so
nervous
that
i
have
to
take
a
sedative
the
doctor
has
given
me
for
emergencies
and
that
generally
puts
me
pretty
soundly
to
sleep
they
sat
about
the
open
fire
after
ted
had
gone
listening
to
the
commotion
of
the
elements
outside
and
talking
fitfully
every
few
moments
miss
marcia
would
rise
go
to
the
window
and
peer
out
nervously
into
the
darkness
once
the
rang
and
every
one
jumped
leslie
hurried
to
answer
it
oh
it
aunt
sally
blake
she
exclaimed
she
wants
to
know
how
we
all
are
and
if
we
happen
to
have
seen
anything
of
eileen
she
was
at
the
hospital
all
the
afternoon
but
she
has
returned
aunt
sally
the
hospital
but
they
said
miss
ramsay
had
left
three
hours
ago
terribly
worried
about
her
thinks
she
may
have
had
an
accident
in
this
storm
she
thought
it
just
possible
eileen
might
have
come
on
out
here
i
said
no
but
would
call
her
up
later
and
see
if
she
had
news
this
latest
turn
of
affairs
added
in
no
wise
to
miss
marcia
peace
of
mind
why
do
you
take
your
powder
now
aunt
marcia
and
go
to
bed
leslie
suggested
at
last
it
only
worrying
you
to
sit
up
and
watch
this
there
no
danger
and
you
might
as
well
go
peacefully
to
sleep
and
forget
it
phyllis
and
i
will
stay
up
quite
a
while
yet
and
if
any
reason
for
it
we
will
wake
you
miss
marcia
herself
thought
well
of
the
plan
and
was
soon
in
bed
and
having
taken
her
the
good
lady
was
shortly
fast
and
dreamlessly
asleep
much
to
the
relief
of
the
girls
and
now
let
go
into
your
room
and
watch
whispered
phyllis
i
just
as
certain
as
i
can
be
that
something
is
going
to
happen
they
arranged
themselves
each
at
a
window
phyllis
at
the
one
toward
the
sea
leslie
facing
curlew
nest
and
began
an
exciting
vigil
with
the
electric
light
switched
off
it
was
so
black
both
inside
and
out
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
distinguish
anything
but
with
the
windows
shut
and
encrusted
with
sand
it
was
utterly
impossible
and
when
they
dared
to
open
them
even
a
crack
the
rain
poured
in
and
drenched
them
they
could
do
this
only
at
intervals
even
rags
seemed
to
share
the
general
uneasiness
and
could
find
no
comfortable
spot
in
which
to
dispose
himself
but
kept
hovering
between
the
two
windows
continually
it
was
leslie
who
suddenly
spoke
in
a
hushed
whisper
she
had
just
opened
her
window
the
merest
crack
and
peeped
out
then
closed
it
again
without
sound
phyllis
come
here
a
moment
look
out
when
i
open
the
window
it
struck
me
that
i
saw
something
some
dark
shape
slip
around
the
corner
of
the
house
next
door
see
if
you
can
see
it
phyllis
applied
her
eye
to
the
crack
when
the
window
was
opened
then
she
drew
her
head
back
with
a
jerk
i
certainly
did
see
something
she
whispered
excitedly
it
slipped
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
bungalow
she
peered
out
again
good
gracious
i
see
it
again
or
else
another
one
does
seem
quite
like
the
first
figure
can
there
possibly
be
two
leslie
then
becoming
impatient
demanded
a
turn
at
the
and
while
she
was
straining
her
gaze
into
the
darkness
they
were
both
electrified
by
a
light
timid
knock
at
the
door
of
the
front
veranda
who
can
be
cried
leslie
and
trembling
perhaps
it
ted
come
back
ventured
phyllis
at
any
rate
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
and
see
rags
alert
also
uttered
a
low
growl
and
leslie
silenced
him
anxiously
if
this
arouses
aunt
marcia
she
whispered
i
shall
be
awfully
worried
be
quiet
rags
they
tiptoed
into
the
switched
on
the
light
and
advanced
to
the
door
again
the
knock
came
light
but
insistent
and
without
further
hesitation
leslie
threw
the
door
open
a
muffled
dripping
figure
inquired
timidly
please
may
i
come
in
dripping
wet
and
chilled
to
the
bone
why
cried
leslie
what
are
you
doing
here
in
this
terrible
storm
i
got
lost
on
the
way
back
from
the
hospital
half
sobbed
the
and
i
must
have
motored
round
and
round
in
the
rain
and
dark
and
at
last
something
went
wrong
with
the
engine
and
i
got
out
and
left
the
car
on
the
road
and
i
walked
and
walked
trying
to
find
some
place
to
stay
and
at
last
i
found
i
was
right
near
here
so
i
came
in
she
seemed
exhausted
and
half
hysterical
and
leslie
could
not
but
believe
her
well
i
so
glad
you
found
and
here
she
cried
i
must
call
up
aunt
sally
right
away
and
tell
her
you
all
right
she
called
a
while
ago
and
was
so
anxious
about
you
leslie
went
to
the
telephone
while
phyllis
helped
eileen
to
rid
herself
of
her
wet
clothes
and
get
into
something
dry
then
they
all
sat
down
by
the
fire
in
an
uneasy
silence
presently
phyllis
suggested
that
eileen
might
like
something
warm
to
eat
and
drink
as
she
had
evidently
had
no
dinner
she
assented
to
this
eagerly
and
the
two
girls
went
to
the
kitchen
to
provide
something
for
her
i
tell
you
whispered
phyllis
i
just
ca
believe
that
hospital
and
stuff
she
came
out
here
for
some
purpose
you
mark
my
word
but
why
she
wants
to
get
in
here
is
beyond
me
just
yet
i
find
out
later
though
you
see
if
i
do
when
they
entered
the
with
a
dainty
tray
a
few
minutes
later
they
found
eileen
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
facing
the
ocean
trying
vainly
to
peer
into
the
outer
blackness
she
started
guiltily
when
she
saw
them
and
retreated
to
the
fire
murmuring
something
about
the
awful
night
but
though
she
had
seemed
so
eager
for
food
she
ate
almost
nothing
ca
you
take
a
little
of
this
hot
soup
urged
leslie
it
will
do
you
so
much
good
you
must
be
very
hungry
by
now
oh
thanks
so
much
eileen
replied
with
a
grateful
glance
you
are
very
good
to
me
i
did
really
think
i
was
hungry
at
first
but
i
so
nervous
i
just
ca
eat
she
pushed
the
tray
aside
and
began
to
roam
restlessly
about
the
room
at
every
decent
excuse
such
as
an
extra
heavy
gust
of
wind
or
a
flapping
of
the
shutters
she
would
hurry
to
the
window
and
try
to
peer
out
at
length
phyllis
made
an
excuse
to
disappear
into
leslie
room
and
was
gone
quite
a
time
suddenly
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
door
into
the
and
remarked
in
a
voice
full
of
suppressed
excitement
leslie
can
you
come
here
a
moment
leslie
excused
herself
and
ran
to
join
phyllis
what
is
it
she
whispered
breathlessly
look
out
of
the
front
window
returned
phyllis
in
a
hushed
undertone
there
something
queer
going
on
outside
by
the
old
log
leslie
opened
the
window
a
crack
the
howl
of
the
storm
and
the
lash
of
rain
was
appalling
and
it
was
two
or
three
minutes
before
she
could
accustom
her
sight
to
the
outer
blackness
but
when
she
did
manage
to
distinguish
something
she
was
startled
to
observe
not
only
one
but
dark
figures
circling
slowly
round
and
round
the
log
like
two
animals
after
the
same
prey
and
watching
each
other
cautiously
but
that
not
all
muttered
phyllis
behind
her
there
a
third
figure
standing
in
the
shadow
right
by
curlew
nest
i
saw
him
out
of
the
side
window
what
on
earth
can
it
all
mean
so
absorbed
were
they
that
neither
of
them
noticed
the
form
that
slipped
into
the
room
behind
them
and
stood
peering
over
their
shoulders
but
they
were
suddenly
startled
beyond
words
to
hear
eileen
close
behind
them
catch
her
breath
with
an
indrawn
hiss
and
mutter
involuntarily
oh
be
careful
look
out
out
chapter
xvi
rags
to
the
rescue
phyllis
whirled
about
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
say
that
she
demanded
in
a
fierce
whisper
eileen
shrank
back
evidently
appalled
by
what
she
had
unconsciously
revealed
i
i
did
mean
anything
she
stammered
you
certainly
did
phyllis
declared
you
said
something
about
who
and
what
is
going
on
outside
there
oh
i
do
know
i
not
sure
i
dreadfully
nervous
that
all
look
here
cried
phyllis
with
stern
determination
i
believe
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
you
will
acknowledge
you
said
something
about
now
i
have
a
brother
ted
and
i
reason
to
think
he
has
been
mixed
up
with
some
of
your
affairs
i
wish
you
would
kindly
explain
it
all
i
think
there
some
trouble
out
there
oh
i
ca
i
ought
eileen
moaned
when
suddenly
leslie
who
had
glanced
again
out
of
the
window
uttered
a
cry
oh
there
something
wrong
they
they
struggling
together
for
something
both
of
the
other
girls
rushed
to
the
window
and
peered
out
over
her
shoulder
there
was
indeed
something
decidedly
exciting
going
on
the
two
figures
who
had
been
circling
about
the
old
log
watching
each
other
like
a
couple
of
wild
animals
were
now
wrestling
together
in
a
fierce
encounter
how
it
had
come
about
the
girls
did
not
know
as
none
of
them
had
been
looking
out
when
it
began
but
it
was
plainly
a
struggle
for
the
possession
of
something
that
one
of
them
had
clutched
tightly
in
his
hand
vaguely
they
could
see
it
dangling
about
as
the
contest
went
on
and
each
in
her
secret
heart
knew
it
to
be
the
burlap
bag
and
its
contents
eileen
cried
phyllis
turning
sharply
upon
the
other
girl
is
one
of
those
two
my
brother
ted
answer
me
truthfully
yes
oh
yes
panted
eileen
and
is
he
in
danger
persisted
phyllis
oh
i
afraid
so
then
i
going
out
to
help
him
declared
phyllis
courageously
come
leslie
and
bring
rags
leslie
never
afterward
knew
how
it
happened
that
she
a
naturally
timid
person
should
have
walked
out
of
that
house
unhesitatingly
and
unquestioningly
to
do
battle
with
some
unknown
enemy
in
the
storm
and
the
dark
if
she
had
had
any
time
to
think
about
it
she
might
have
faltered
but
phyllis
gave
her
no
time
with
rags
at
their
heels
they
snatched
up
some
wraps
and
all
suddenly
burst
out
of
the
front
door
onto
the
veranda
phyllis
having
stopped
only
long
enough
to
take
up
her
electric
torch
from
the
table
she
switched
this
on
in
the
darkness
and
guided
by
its
light
they
plunged
into
the
storm
the
force
of
the
wind
almost
took
their
breath
away
and
as
they
plowed
along
leslie
was
horrified
to
notice
that
the
tide
had
crept
almost
up
to
the
level
of
the
old
log
and
was
within
sixty
feet
of
the
bungalow
oh
what
we
do
if
it
comes
much
higher
she
moaned
to
herself
but
from
that
moment
on
she
had
little
time
for
such
considerations
phyllis
had
plunged
ahead
with
the
light
and
the
two
other
girls
followed
her
in
the
shadow
leslie
was
somewhat
hampered
in
her
advance
as
she
was
holding
rags
by
his
collar
and
he
strongly
objected
to
the
restraint
but
she
dared
not
let
him
loose
just
then
suddenly
they
were
plunged
in
utter
darkness
phyllis
torch
had
given
out
and
the
two
others
reaching
her
side
at
that
instant
heard
her
gasp
oh
dreadful
can
anything
be
the
matter
with
this
battery
but
after
a
moment
manipulation
the
light
flashed
on
again
it
was
in
this
instant
that
they
saw
the
face
of
ted
lying
on
the
ground
and
staring
up
at
them
while
his
assailant
held
him
firmly
pinned
beneath
him
in
an
iron
grip
help
shrieked
ted
above
the
roar
of
the
wind
let
rags
loose
they
needed
no
other
signal
leslie
released
her
hold
on
the
impatient
animal
and
with
a
snarl
that
was
almost
unnerving
he
darted
straight
as
an
arrow
for
ted
assailant
the
girls
never
knew
the
whole
history
of
that
encounter
they
only
realized
that
ted
finally
emerged
from
a
whirling
medley
of
legs
and
arms
limping
but
triumphant
and
strove
to
loosen
the
dog
grip
on
a
man
who
was
begging
to
be
released
that
do
rags
old
boy
you
done
the
trick
good
old
fellow
now
you
can
let
go
he
shouted
at
the
dog
trying
to
persuade
him
to
loosen
his
hold
but
rags
was
obdurate
he
could
see
no
point
in
giving
up
the
struggle
at
this
interesting
juncture
call
him
off
ted
shouted
to
the
girls
i
ca
make
him
let
go
is
it
cried
phyllis
in
answer
we
have
to
take
a
chance
he
answered
he
half
killing
this
fellow
with
beating
heart
leslie
came
into
the
range
of
the
light
grasped
rags
by
the
collar
and
pulled
at
him
with
all
her
might
come
rags
let
go
it
all
right
the
dog
gave
way
reluctantly
and
when
he
had
at
length
loosed
his
terrible
grip
and
was
safely
in
leslie
custody
the
man
scrambled
to
his
feet
rose
held
on
to
his
arm
with
his
other
hand
and
groaned
and
despite
his
disheveled
condition
and
his
drenched
appearance
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
torch
the
girls
recognized
him
with
a
start
of
amazement
it
was
the
fisherman
of
the
afternoon
the
man
with
the
former
limp
illustration
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
torch
the
girls
recognized
him
he
turned
immediately
on
ted
with
an
angry
impatient
gesture
well
the
other
fellow
got
it
after
all
i
do
know
what
business
had
in
this
concern
but
you
spoiled
the
trick
for
me
and
did
do
yourself
any
good
and
if
that
dog
gives
me
hydrophobia
i
sue
the
whole
outfit
of
you
he
beat
it
off
in
that
direction
the
other
fellow
i
saw
that
much
i
ca
lose
any
time
though
what
i
need
is
a
doctor
and
with
another
angry
snort
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
and
the
hurricane
chapter
xvii
eileen
explains
it
was
an
amazed
bewildered
and
sheepish
group
that
faced
each
other
in
the
light
of
the
electric
torch
after
the
departure
of
the
unknown
man
phyllis
was
the
first
to
recover
well
we
might
as
well
go
indoors
she
remarked
in
her
decided
way
there
evidently
nothing
to
be
gained
by
staying
out
here
in
the
storm
the
others
still
too
benumbed
in
mind
to
have
any
initiative
of
their
own
followed
her
obediently
only
when
they
were
at
the
door
did
leslie
arouse
to
the
immediate
urgencies
do
please
be
very
quiet
and
not
wake
aunt
marcia
she
begged
afraid
the
effect
on
her
would
be
very
bad
if
she
were
to
realize
all
that
has
happened
here
they
entered
the
bungalow
on
tiptoe
removed
their
drenched
wraps
and
sank
down
in
the
nearest
chairs
by
the
dying
fire
and
now
remarked
phyllis
constituting
herself
spokesman
as
she
threw
on
a
fresh
log
and
some
smaller
sticks
we
be
awfully
obliged
to
you
ted
and
eileen
if
you
kindly
explain
what
this
mystery
is
all
about
i
do
see
why
under
the
sun
had
to
come
butting
into
it
muttered
ted
resentfully
nursing
some
bruises
he
had
sustained
in
the
recent
fray
please
remember
retorted
phyllis
that
if
i
had
come
butting
into
it
and
leslie
and
rags
you
probably
be
very
much
the
worse
for
wear
at
this
moment
that
so
forgive
me
old
girl
you
do
a
fine
piece
of
work
all
of
you
i
just
sore
because
the
thing
turned
out
so
badly
but
what
i
really
meant
was
that
i
ca
see
how
you
got
mixed
up
in
it
at
all
from
the
very
beginning
i
mean
that
precisely
what
we
think
about
laughed
phyllis
felt
all
along
as
if
it
were
affair
and
that
were
interfering
so
i
think
we
better
have
explanations
all
around
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
eileen
affair
most
of
all
so
i
think
she
better
do
her
explaining
first
ted
offered
as
a
solution
of
the
tangle
they
all
looked
toward
eileen
sitting
cowered
over
the
fire
and
she
answered
their
look
with
a
startled
gaze
of
her
own
i
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
she
faltered
turning
to
ted
do
you
think
i
ought
i
guess
you
better
he
declared
it
got
to
a
point
where
these
folks
seem
to
have
some
inside
information
of
their
own
that
perhaps
might
be
valuable
to
you
how
they
got
it
i
ca
think
at
any
rate
there
be
no
harm
done
by
it
i
can
vouch
for
that
so
just
fire
away
thus
adjured
eileen
drew
a
long
breath
and
said
hesitantly
i
i
really
do
know
just
where
to
begin
a
lot
of
it
is
just
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
i
think
you
all
have
heard
that
i
have
a
grandfather
who
is
very
ill
in
a
hospital
over
in
branchville
he
is
the
honorable
arthur
ramsay
of
norwich
england
he
has
been
for
many
years
a
traveler
and
explorer
in
china
and
india
and
tibet
early
this
year
he
had
a
severe
attack
of
indian
fever
and
could
not
seem
to
recuperate
so
he
started
for
england
coming
by
way
of
the
pacific
and
america
when
he
got
to
the
atlantic
coast
this
last
summer
some
one
recommended
that
he
should
try
staying
a
few
weeks
at
this
beach
so
he
took
a
bungalow
and
spent
part
of
the
summer
and
autumn
here
and
thought
he
was
much
benefited
do
excuse
me
for
interrupting
exclaimed
phyllis
but
was
the
bungalow
he
rented
curlew
nest
why
yes
hesitated
eileen
with
a
startled
glance
at
her
it
it
was
then
do
you
mind
telling
me
how
it
was
that
the
name
was
so
different
persisted
phyllis
danforth
understood
that
she
rented
it
to
a
horatio
gaines
oh
that
was
because
grandfather
did
want
it
in
his
own
name
because
you
see
he
a
rather
person
in
england
and
even
over
here
and
he
needed
a
complete
rest
with
no
danger
of
having
to
be
interviewed
or
called
upon
or
anything
like
that
so
he
had
his
man
geoffrey
horatio
gaines
hire
the
place
and
transact
all
the
business
here
in
name
it
saved
grandfather
a
lot
of
trouble
for
geoffrey
simply
took
charge
of
everything
and
as
grandfather
never
went
among
people
here
no
one
was
the
wiser
after
he
left
the
cottage
he
expected
to
go
to
new
york
and
remain
there
till
he
sailed
for
home
and
he
go
there
for
a
few
days
but
his
health
at
once
grew
worse
so
he
returned
to
the
beach
of
course
the
bungalow
was
closed
by
that
time
so
he
took
rooms
at
the
hotel
farther
along
it
was
there
that
i
joined
him
i
had
come
over
here
with
friends
of
mother
earlier
in
the
summer
and
had
been
visiting
at
their
summer
camp
in
the
adirondacks
until
i
should
join
grandfather
and
return
to
england
with
him
i
had
been
with
him
more
than
two
or
three
days
when
i
realized
that
something
had
gone
awfully
wrong
somehow
or
other
grandfather
was
worried
and
upset
about
something
and
he
began
to
watch
his
mail
and
be
anxious
to
avoid
meeting
any
one
he
could
or
would
explain
things
to
me
but
had
long
interviews
with
his
man
geoffrey
who
has
been
with
him
for
years
and
years
and
whom
he
trusts
completely
at
last
one
awfully
stormy
night
about
two
weeks
ago
geoffrey
disappeared
and
has
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
we
ca
imagine
what
has
become
of
him
and
the
next
day
grandfather
was
so
worried
about
him
and
the
other
troubles
that
a
cold
he
had
ran
into
a
severe
attack
of
pneumonia
of
course
it
was
feasible
for
him
to
remain
at
the
hotel
especially
as
it
was
soon
to
close
so
he
had
himself
taken
to
the
nearest
good
hospital
which
happened
to
be
this
one
at
branchville
since
he
did
have
geoffrey
to
wait
on
him
he
wanted
to
be
where
he
could
have
the
best
attention
and
nursing
and
as
i
could
run
his
car
which
geoffrey
had
always
done
i
could
get
easily
there
to
see
him
then
as
you
probably
know
the
hotel
closed
for
the
season
and
the
manager
very
kindly
found
me
a
place
to
stay
with
aunt
sally
blake
in
the
village
she
has
been
very
good
and
kind
to
me
but
i
expect
worried
her
a
lot
not
because
i
did
care
but
because
i
could
help
it
and
i
could
tell
her
about
things
but
oh
i
have
been
so
troubled
so
fairly
at
times
you
can
not
even
guess
the
awful
burden
i
had
to
bear
and
all
alone
at
least
till
i
came
quite
by
accident
to
know
your
brother
ted
he
has
helped
me
so
much
but
that
is
another
part
of
the
story
one
night
grandfather
fever
was
very
high
and
he
was
delirious
i
begged
his
nurse
to
let
me
sit
with
him
awhile
and
i
heard
him
constantly
muttering
about
the
bungalow
and
geoffrey
hiding
something
there
and
it
being
safe
at
curlew
nest
and
a
lot
more
remarks
of
that
kind
next
morning
he
was
a
little
better
and
in
his
right
mind
again
so
i
asked
him
what
he
had
meant
by
the
things
he
had
talked
about
the
night
before
and
then
he
said
i
have
to
trust
you
with
some
of
the
secret
i
believe
since
you
overheard
what
you
have
perhaps
you
may
even
be
able
to
help
and
of
course
i
can
trust
you
to
keep
your
own
counsel
absolutely
there
been
a
very
mysterious
here
and
it
involves
far
more
than
you
may
imagine
in
fact
it
might
even
become
an
affair
of
international
moment
if
something
is
not
found
and
quickly
too
the
gist
of
the
matter
is
this
while
i
was
in
china
last
year
i
had
some
informal
correspondence
with
an
official
very
high
in
government
circles
there
concerning
his
attitude
in
regard
to
the
province
of
shantung
as
he
was
inclined
to
be
very
friendly
toward
me
at
the
time
he
was
just
a
little
expansive
and
indiscreet
i
think
those
were
grandfather
words
in
regard
to
his
government
plans
later
i
think
he
regretted
this
and
made
some
overtures
to
have
his
letters
returned
but
i
pretended
not
to
understand
him
and
the
matter
was
dropped
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
thought
them
too
suggestive
and
important
to
my
own
government
to
part
with
them
it
is
these
letters
that
are
the
heart
of
the
whole
trouble
grandfather
says
he
heard
nothing
more
about
them
till
he
came
to
stay
at
the
hotel
here
then
he
received
a
very
threatening
letter
declaring
that
if
this
packet
was
not
returned
to
the
writer
serious
consequences
would
result
it
did
say
consequences
but
grandfather
suspected
they
might
even
go
as
far
as
an
attempt
on
his
life
but
he
was
determined
not
to
give
up
the
letters
you
see
they
concerned
a
matter
that
might
involve
his
own
country
with
china
and
he
felt
they
should
be
delivered
to
his
own
government
beside
that
he
is
just
stubborn
enough
not
to
be
bullied
into
anything
by
threats
his
man
geoffrey
tried
to
persuade
him
to
put
the
letters
in
a
vault
in
new
york
but
grandfather
says
he
is
in
some
things
and
does
trust
even
to
boxes
says
he
prefers
to
keep
things
he
values
in
his
own
possession
he
had
the
letters
in
a
queer
little
bronze
box
that
was
given
him
years
ago
by
the
late
empress
dowager
of
china
it
had
a
secret
lock
that
was
quite
impossible
to
open
unless
one
knew
the
trick
he
carried
this
in
his
pocket
and
slept
with
it
under
his
pillow
at
night
and
felt
perfectly
safe
about
it
here
eileen
paused
a
moment
for
breath
and
the
two
other
girls
glanced
at
each
other
guiltily
but
they
said
nothing
then
eileen
went
on
one
night
just
after
i
came
there
was
an
attempt
to
rob
him
at
the
hotel
the
attempt
failed
because
geoffrey
happened
to
be
awake
and
discovered
some
one
prowling
about
grandfather
whoever
it
was
escaped
through
the
window
without
even
his
face
being
seen
and
there
was
no
trace
of
him
later
grandfather
made
geoffrey
keep
the
thing
quiet
and
not
report
it
to
the
hotel
because
he
did
want
any
publicity
about
the
matter
but
he
decided
then
that
it
would
be
safer
to
have
the
thing
hidden
somewhere
for
a
time
in
some
place
where
no
one
would
dream
of
hunting
for
it
and
it
struck
him
that
down
at
the
bungalow
where
he
had
spent
those
quiet
weeks
and
which
he
supposed
was
all
shut
up
and
deserted
would
be
as
unlikely
a
spot
as
any
to
be
suspected
of
hiding
such
a
thing
he
supposed
that
the
one
next
door
this
one
was
closed
also
or
i
do
not
think
he
would
have
considered
that
so
the
next
night
which
happened
to
be
one
when
there
was
a
very
hard
storm
he
sent
geoffrey
down
to
the
bungalow
with
the
little
box
containing
the
letters
he
did
not
wish
him
to
take
the
car
as
it
might
be
too
conspicuous
but
had
him
go
on
foot
geoffrey
had
found
out
during
the
summer
that
one
could
get
into
that
place
through
a
door
at
the
side
by
working
at
the
hook
through
the
crack
with
a
and
he
intended
to
get
into
the
cottage
and
conceal
the
box
in
some
there
but
here
is
where
the
mystery
begins
geoffrey
set
off
that
night
but
has
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
what
has
happened
to
him
we
can
not
imagine
unless
he
was
caught
and
taken
a
prisoner
by
some
one
concerned
in
getting
those
letters
if
he
had
been
killed
we
would
surely
know
it
yet
if
he
were
alive
it
seems
as
if
we
should
have
heard
from
him
somehow
he
was
a
most
devoted
and
faithful
and
trustworthy
soul
so
we
are
sure
that
something
must
have
happened
to
him
that
he
is
being
detained
somewhere
grandfather
is
quite
certain
that
he
is
guarding
the
secret
of
that
box
somehow
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
wait
till
he
comes
back
or
sends
us
some
word
what
grandfather
asked
me
to
do
was
to
run
out
here
in
the
car
some
day
and
if
there
was
no
one
about
to
scout
around
and
see
if
i
could
discover
any
clue
to
the
mystery
without
attracting
attention
he
supposed
of
course
that
the
beach
was
by
that
time
entirely
deserted
i
came
out
the
very
next
day
but
found
to
my
disgust
that
the
cottage
next
door
was
occupied
by
you
as
i
now
know
but
i
felt
it
would
not
be
wise
to
be
seen
about
here
in
the
daytime
so
without
saying
anything
to
grandfather
who
would
be
awfully
upset
if
he
knew
it
i
determined
to
run
out
about
ten
that
night
and
scout
around
when
you
people
would
probably
be
in
bed
and
here
is
where
ted
comes
into
it
i
got
here
that
night
as
i
had
planned
found
no
one
about
and
tried
the
experiment
of
getting
into
the
side
door
as
grandfather
had
explained
but
i
found
it
very
difficult
in
fact
quite
impossible
for
and
while
i
was
fussing
with
it
i
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
low
voice
right
behind
me
inquiring
politely
what
i
was
trying
to
do
it
was
ted
here
who
had
been
out
for
a
stroll
and
happening
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
me
at
this
very
peculiar
occupation
and
naturally
thinking
i
was
a
burglar
had
come
up
unobserved
to
find
out
about
it
you
can
just
imagine
what
an
position
it
was
for
me
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
i
know
that
legally
i
had
no
business
there
and
if
he
were
inclined
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
he
could
have
me
arrested
i
literally
almost
went
out
of
my
mind
at
that
moment
but
i
guess
something
must
have
made
him
feel
that
i
was
really
a
burglar
or
anything
of
that
sort
for
he
just
said
very
kindly
you
are
in
trouble
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
did
see
how
he
could
possibly
help
me
unless
he
knew
the
whole
story
and
i
thought
i
ought
not
tell
any
one
but
unless
i
did
i
was
certainly
in
a
very
terrible
position
so
i
suddenly
made
up
my
mind
it
would
have
to
be
done
for
something
made
me
feel
he
was
honorable
and
trustworthy
and
that
the
secret
would
be
safe
with
him
what
made
me
feel
all
the
more
sure
was
that
he
mentioned
that
he
was
staying
up
the
beach
at
his
father
bungalow
and
had
happened
to
be
out
for
a
walk
and
had
seen
me
there
i
know
he
said
it
to
make
me
feel
easier
and
that
everything
was
all
right
so
i
told
him
as
much
as
i
could
of
the
story
and
when
he
had
heard
it
he
said
happen
to
know
all
about
opening
that
door
because
i
know
the
people
who
own
the
cottage
very
well
perhaps
you
had
better
let
me
try
i
said
i
be
only
too
glad
to
and
he
had
the
door
unfastened
in
a
moment
then
he
told
me
to
go
in
and
examine
the
place
all
i
wished
to
and
he
would
watch
outside
if
i
needed
any
help
i
could
call
and
he
would
come
in
and
do
what
he
could
for
me
well
i
went
in
and
examined
the
whole
place
with
my
electric
torch
but
i
could
not
discover
a
single
thing
except
that
one
of
the
bricks
in
the
fireplace
had
been
partly
loosened
and
a
broken
was
in
the
corner
of
the
it
was
the
only
thing
i
could
see
to
show
that
possibly
geoffrey
had
been
there
i
thought
the
looked
like
one
i
had
seen
him
use
but
as
i
did
see
a
sign
of
the
bronze
box
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
stay
any
longer
so
i
came
out
ted
fastened
the
door
again
went
with
me
to
the
car
which
i
had
left
down
the
road
and
offered
to
give
me
any
further
help
he
could
at
any
time
he
promised
to
keep
the
secret
from
every
one
and
said
that
he
would
make
an
even
more
thorough
search
over
curlew
nest
if
i
wished
because
he
had
much
better
opportunity
to
do
so
of
course
i
agreed
to
that
and
went
on
back
to
aunt
sally
two
days
later
ted
saw
my
car
going
along
one
of
the
back
roads
near
the
village
signaled
to
me
and
told
me
that
the
day
before
he
had
caught
you
girls
coming
out
of
curlew
nest
and
that
you
acted
rather
guilty
and
refused
to
explain
what
you
had
been
in
there
for
he
told
me
that
you
might
possibly
suspect
something
and
to
steer
clear
of
you
if
we
should
happen
to
encounter
each
other
as
it
is
always
likely
that
people
will
in
this
town
he
described
what
you
both
looked
like
so
that
i
could
fail
to
know
you
and
sure
enough
i
met
you
both
that
very
morning
in
little
store
and
i
expect
you
think
i
acted
in
a
perfectly
abominable
manner
i
just
hated
to
do
it
for
i
liked
the
looks
of
you
both
but
i
felt
i
must
take
no
chances
ted
also
told
me
that
he
had
been
in
curlew
nest
the
night
before
and
had
gone
over
the
place
very
carefully
once
more
but
had
found
nothing
except
a
string
of
beads
that
had
been
torn
from
the
fringe
of
my
girdle
that
other
night
and
had
been
lying
on
the
floor
i
remember
that
the
girdle
caught
when
i
was
looking
under
one
of
the
bureaus
he
also
gave
me
the
broken
to
keep
as
he
said
it
was
best
to
leave
nothing
around
there
that
any
one
else
could
discover
and
use
as
a
clue
a
day
or
two
later
i
met
you
phyllis
at
aunt
sally
and
she
insist
on
introducing
us
though
i
could
see
you
were
no
more
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
after
the
way
i
acted
than
i
was
but
i
encountered
ted
again
that
afternoon
and
he
said
he
had
hunted
me
up
to
tell
me
he
had
news
and
also
a
plan
that
he
wanted
to
suggest
he
said
he
had
noticed
during
the
last
two
or
three
days
a
strange
man
who
seemed
to
haunt
the
beach
just
a
short
way
off
and
out
of
sight
of
the
two
bungalows
the
man
seemed
to
be
a
very
ardent
fisherman
and
an
expert
one
too
but
ted
had
noticed
that
he
kept
a
very
sharp
lookout
toward
the
bungalows
when
he
thought
no
one
was
around
to
see
he
suspected
that
perhaps
this
man
had
something
to
do
with
the
mystery
the
plan
he
suggested
was
that
i
get
acquainted
with
you
girls
after
all
in
some
way
that
seemed
the
most
natural
but
without
letting
you
know
that
i
was
also
acquainted
with
and
when
i
had
done
so
i
had
better
offer
to
take
you
all
out
for
a
long
drive
in
the
car
and
keep
you
away
a
good
while
and
give
him
a
chance
to
see
what
this
man
was
up
to
if
anything
the
getting
acquainted
was
easy
and
you
all
know
how
i
managed
and
also
the
ride
a
day
or
two
later
when
i
was
returning
from
the
ride
that
night
at
dusk
ted
signaled
me
from
the
bushes
near
curlew
nest
jumped
into
the
car
and
told
me
what
had
happened
in
the
afternoon
he
had
gone
off
to
the
village
first
then
hurried
back
slipped
up
here
by
way
of
the
creek
and
hidden
himself
in
a
clump
of
rushes
across
the
road
just
as
he
had
suspected
he
saw
his
suspicious
fisherman
sneak
up
here
after
a
while
scout
around
the
outside
of
the
bungalow
disappear
into
it
for
a
time
by
the
side
door
come
out
apparently
stare
at
the
outside
again
for
a
long
time
and
then
at
your
bungalow
and
finally
disappear
but
that
was
not
all
he
waited
where
he
was
a
few
minutes
thinking
possibly
the
man
might
come
back
and
he
was
just
about
to
come
out
when
along
came
an
automobile
with
men
in
it
which
stopped
directly
in
front
of
curlew
nest
he
could
not
see
their
faces
for
they
had
slouch
hats
pulled
far
down
on
their
heads
they
got
out
and
walked
about
a
bit
evidently
to
see
if
any
one
was
around
then
thinking
themselves
alone
they
hurried
up
to
the
bungalow
worked
at
the
side
door
and
finally
got
in
shortly
after
they
came
out
again
and
walked
down
to
the
beach
where
he
could
not
see
them
then
they
came
back
got
into
the
car
and
drove
off
by
that
time
it
was
growing
so
late
that
he
concluded
he
would
stay
where
he
was
and
wait
for
me
to
come
back
which
he
did
before
he
left
me
we
had
a
slight
breakdown
and
in
helping
me
fix
it
he
hurt
his
hand
but
that
same
night
long
after
midnight
he
got
into
curlew
nest
again
to
see
if
he
could
find
out
what
had
happened
and
he
found
a
very
strange
message
left
on
the
table
a
warning
to
the
one
who
had
taken
the
article
as
it
was
called
from
its
to
return
it
and
underneath
a
printed
note
in
pencil
saying
it
would
be
returned
he
thought
probably
the
first
man
had
left
the
part
and
the
other
two
had
printed
the
answer
underneath
that
was
all
he
could
make
of
it
it
was
all
very
mysterious
but
while
we
could
make
much
out
of
it
at
least
it
showed
that
something
concerning
the
affair
was
going
on
and
that
the
place
must
be
closely
watched
ted
volunteered
to
keep
this
watch
meanwhile
grandfather
had
had
a
very
bad
turn
and
i
was
with
him
constantly
he
was
terribly
depressed
over
the
whole
affair
even
his
doctor
who
knows
nothing
about
this
said
he
was
evidently
worrying
about
something
and
if
the
cause
of
worry
were
not
removed
he
doubted
the
possibility
of
recovery
tonight
i
stayed
with
him
later
than
usual
and
in
returning
actually
did
lose
my
way
in
the
storm
but
when
i
at
last
discovered
where
i
was
i
knew
that
it
was
not
far
from
here
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
come
over
and
see
if
anything
was
happening
i
found
ted
also
scouting
around
and
suddenly
we
realized
that
some
one
else
was
on
the
ground
too
though
we
could
not
tell
in
the
darkness
and
rain
but
ted
thought
it
very
dangerous
for
me
to
be
out
there
so
he
made
me
come
in
here
as
i
did
and
i
need
not
tell
you
what
happened
after
that
eileen
ceased
speaking
and
phyllis
had
just
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
all
four
jumped
nervously
but
ted
got
up
and
went
to
open
it
to
their
immense
alarm
the
opened
door
revealed
the
figure
of
the
man
with
the
limp
chapter
xviii
the
dragon
gives
up
the
secret
the
man
also
started
back
at
the
sight
of
all
four
of
them
together
and
rags
who
had
been
drying
himself
quietly
by
the
fire
rose
with
a
snarl
and
leaped
toward
his
enemy
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
heavens
do
let
that
animal
loose
on
me
again
cried
the
man
backing
off
i
just
been
down
to
the
village
doctor
and
had
my
arm
cauterized
as
it
is
i
stopped
in
to
tell
you
something
you
better
know
probably
you
have
noticed
it
if
you
have
looked
out
recently
the
water
is
rising
rapidly
and
will
soon
be
very
nearly
up
to
your
bungalow
you
may
want
to
get
out
before
it
sweeps
under
it
with
a
cry
of
alarm
they
all
leaped
toward
the
door
ted
grasping
rags
firmly
by
the
collar
it
was
even
as
the
man
had
said
peering
through
the
darkness
they
could
see
the
water
spreading
inward
from
a
recent
breaker
only
about
feet
from
the
veranda
and
the
next
breaker
spread
in
even
a
few
inches
further
what
we
do
cried
leslie
aunt
marcia
will
be
frightened
to
death
if
she
knows
it
and
how
i
to
get
her
out
of
here
in
this
howling
storm
or
where
i
can
take
her
i
ca
imagine
but
ted
had
been
critically
examining
the
weather
do
worry
leslie
he
soothed
her
the
wind
is
shifting
i
noticed
just
now
that
it
seemed
to
be
around
to
the
north
and
is
getting
farther
west
also
that
means
the
storm
is
almost
over
and
the
tide
ought
to
turn
in
ten
minutes
or
so
it
practically
at
its
highest
now
ten
chances
to
one
it
wo
rise
more
than
a
foot
or
two
further
but
we
keep
watch
and
if
it
does
we
get
your
aunt
out
of
here
in
eileen
car
which
is
just
down
the
road
and
take
her
either
to
our
place
or
to
the
village
our
bungalow
is
likely
to
be
damaged
as
it
farther
up
the
dune
than
these
worry
thus
encouraged
leslie
turned
indoors
again
and
the
man
who
was
still
lingering
on
the
porch
remarked
if
it
is
too
much
trouble
friends
i
like
to
come
in
for
a
minute
or
two
and
ask
you
folks
a
few
questions
about
that
little
fracas
this
evening
and
how
you
came
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
it
all
right
and
perfectly
proper
he
hastened
to
add
seeing
their
startled
glances
i
can
show
you
my
credentials
he
opened
his
coat
and
exhibited
a
shield
on
his
vest
the
shield
of
a
detective
of
the
new
york
police
force
so
amazed
were
they
that
they
could
scarcely
reply
but
the
man
took
matters
in
his
own
hands
and
walked
into
the
house
and
leslie
never
even
thought
to
warn
him
to
speak
softly
because
of
aunt
marcia
unconsciously
they
grouped
themselves
about
him
at
the
open
fire
and
rags
now
that
the
obnoxious
stranger
had
been
admitted
to
the
house
on
a
hospitable
footing
made
no
further
demonstrations
of
enmity
my
name
is
barnes
detective
barnes
of
the
new
york
force
he
began
and
i
like
to
clear
up
one
or
two
little
puzzles
here
before
i
go
on
with
this
business
it
a
rather
peculiar
one
i
heard
this
young
gentleman
refer
to
a
car
that
was
standing
in
the
road
near
here
and
say
it
belonged
to
one
of
you
young
ladies
named
eileen
i
like
to
inform
miss
eileen
that
the
party
who
got
that
little
article
we
were
all
scrapping
for
jumped
into
her
car
when
he
got
to
the
road
tore
like
mad
in
it
to
the
station
left
it
there
and
caught
the
express
for
new
york
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
disappearing
in
it
but
of
course
had
to
walk
to
the
village
i
suspected
what
he
was
going
to
do
though
and
i
went
straight
to
the
station
and
found
the
car
standing
there
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
getting
in
it
driving
myself
to
the
village
doctor
and
then
back
out
here
you
will
find
your
car
miss
eileen
standing
just
where
you
left
it
but
i
thought
you
like
to
know
it
had
had
the
little
adventure
eileen
opened
her
mouth
to
reply
but
the
man
gave
her
no
chance
turning
immediately
to
ted
and
as
for
you
young
man
i
suppose
you
thought
you
were
doing
a
wonderful
stunt
when
you
landed
into
me
just
as
i
unearthed
the
thing
i
been
on
the
trail
of
for
a
week
but
have
to
tell
you
that
you
spoiled
one
of
the
prettiest
little
pieces
of
detective
work
i
undertaken
for
several
years
and
may
have
helped
to
precipitate
a
bit
of
international
trouble
beside
i
do
know
what
your
motive
was
i
suppose
you
thought
me
a
burglar
but
just
a
moment
cried
eileen
springing
forward
tell
me
why
are
you
concerned
in
this
my
name
is
ramsay
and
i
have
a
right
to
ask
detective
barnes
was
visibly
startled
are
you
a
relative
of
the
honorable
arthur
ramsay
he
demanded
and
when
she
had
told
him
he
exclaimed
then
you
must
know
all
about
geoffrey
gaines
and
how
he
disappeared
i
known
him
since
i
was
a
baby
she
answered
but
how
he
disappeared
is
still
an
awful
mystery
to
us
my
grandfather
is
very
ill
in
the
branchville
hospital
you
know
but
did
he
receive
my
letter
cried
barnes
i
sent
it
two
days
ago
he
has
been
too
ill
to
read
any
mail
for
the
last
two
days
replied
eileen
and
of
course
i
have
not
opened
it
well
that
explains
why
i
have
heard
from
him
the
man
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
of
relief
then
i
guess
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
that
gaines
is
alive
and
well
but
kept
a
close
prisoner
by
some
heathen
chinese
in
a
house
on
a
west
side
street
in
new
york
but
how
why
did
it
happen
the
the
night
he
came
down
here
she
ventured
i
see
you
pretty
well
informed
about
the
matter
he
remarked
cautiously
and
if
these
others
are
equally
so
i
guess
it
safe
for
me
to
go
on
and
give
you
a
history
of
the
thing
eileen
nodded
and
he
went
on
gaines
and
i
used
to
know
each
other
in
england
years
before
he
entered
your
grandfather
service
in
fact
we
had
been
schoolmates
together
then
i
came
over
to
this
country
and
entered
the
detective
service
and
he
went
into
another
walk
of
life
but
we
kept
in
touch
with
each
other
by
writing
occasionally
a
week
or
so
ago
i
was
astonished
to
receive
a
letter
from
him
written
on
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
of
paper
and
in
an
envelope
plainly
manufactured
by
himself
it
contained
some
very
singular
news
it
gave
me
first
the
history
of
those
letters
and
how
anxious
your
grandfather
was
to
keep
hold
of
them
then
it
told
how
he
gaines
had
taken
the
box
down
here
that
night
and
tried
first
to
conceal
it
in
the
bungalow
but
no
place
in
the
house
seemed
safe
enough
to
him
he
tried
to
dig
up
a
brick
in
the
fireplace
and
bury
it
there
but
gave
it
up
after
he
had
broken
his
knife
in
the
attempt
then
he
had
the
inspiration
to
bury
it
in
the
sand
somewhere
outside
and
he
described
where
he
locate
it
right
by
that
log
if
gaines
had
known
much
about
the
tides
here
he
would
have
thought
that
a
very
good
scheme
he
did
though
and
thought
he
found
an
excellent
place
he
then
turned
to
walk
back
to
the
hotel
but
had
gone
more
than
a
mile
it
was
storming
hard
if
you
remember
when
a
terrific
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
knocked
him
senseless
he
never
knew
another
thing
until
he
came
to
after
what
must
have
been
a
number
of
days
to
find
himself
a
prisoner
in
a
house
he
judged
to
be
somewhere
in
new
york
and
from
his
description
i
located
it
about
west
street
he
appeared
to
be
in
the
keeping
of
a
chinaman
who
dressed
american
fashion
and
spoke
good
english
he
was
told
that
he
was
a
prisoner
and
that
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
communicate
with
any
one
until
he
had
reported
exactly
where
and
how
those
letters
had
been
concealed
he
begged
for
a
day
or
two
to
consider
the
matter
and
was
granted
it
but
told
that
if
he
did
not
comply
with
their
wishes
he
would
disappear
for
good
and
no
one
would
ever
be
the
wiser
in
the
meantime
he
managed
to
get
together
a
few
scraps
of
paper
and
with
the
stub
of
a
pencil
he
happened
to
have
about
him
he
wrote
this
letter
to
me
describing
the
location
of
the
letters
and
how
he
had
hidden
them
in
a
bronze
box
wrapped
in
a
burlap
bag
he
urged
me
to
go
and
get
them
at
once
and
then
later
he
could
safely
describe
to
his
captors
where
he
had
hidden
them
perhaps
you
wonder
how
he
expected
to
get
this
letter
to
me
since
he
was
so
carefully
guarded
he
said
that
he
was
on
the
third
floor
front
of
the
house
near
a
corner
where
he
could
see
a
he
happened
to
have
a
solitary
stamp
in
his
pocket
which
he
put
on
the
letter
then
at
some
hour
when
he
thought
his
captors
were
busy
elsewhere
he
expected
to
attract
the
attention
of
some
children
playing
in
the
street
and
offer
to
throw
them
some
money
if
they
would
mail
the
letter
in
the
nearby
box
as
i
received
the
letter
no
doubt
his
plan
worked
successfully
at
any
rate
i
got
it
a
week
ago
and
started
on
the
trail
immediately
i
landed
out
here
one
morning
while
it
was
still
dark
and
dug
all
around
the
spot
mentioned
but
could
find
a
trace
of
the
bag
or
box
oh
i
saw
you
that
morning
cried
leslie
but
when
you
walked
away
you
seemed
to
stoop
and
had
a
bad
limp
i
do
understand
i
know
you
saw
me
he
smiled
or
at
least
that
one
did
for
as
i
happened
to
glance
back
at
this
house
it
was
growing
just
light
enough
for
me
to
realize
there
was
some
one
watching
at
the
window
so
i
adopted
that
stoop
and
limp
as
i
walked
away
just
so
you
would
not
be
likely
to
recognize
me
if
you
saw
me
again
it
is
a
ruse
i
often
practised
but
it
did
work
time
laughed
leslie
for
i
recognized
you
again
this
afternoon
by
the
way
you
dusted
the
sand
off
your
hands
and
threw
away
the
stick
well
you
are
certainly
a
more
observing
person
than
most
people
he
answered
gravely
but
to
go
on
of
course
i
was
very
much
disappointed
but
i
remained
here
staying
at
the
village
hotel
and
kept
as
close
a
watch
on
the
place
as
was
possible
pretending
all
the
time
that
i
was
here
on
a
fishing
excursion
i
tried
very
hard
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
these
bungalows
in
the
daytime
anyway
the
day
you
all
went
off
on
the
auto
ride
the
coast
seemed
clear
and
i
went
through
the
place
but
i
had
been
out
of
it
long
and
walked
down
to
the
beach
when
i
saw
the
two
men
drive
up
in
a
car
and
enter
the
bungalow
also
and
later
come
out
to
dig
by
that
old
log
of
course
they
did
see
me
about
i
took
care
of
that
and
i
knew
beyond
a
doubt
that
they
were
gaines
chinamen
come
to
find
the
booty
of
course
they
did
find
it
any
more
than
i
had
and
i
felt
sure
they
would
go
back
and
make
it
hot
for
gaines
and
i
judged
that
he
would
probably
try
to
gain
time
in
some
way
i
went
back
to
my
hotel
that
night
to
think
it
all
over
and
make
further
plans
and
did
visit
the
bungalow
again
till
next
evening
when
i
found
to
my
astonishment
a
queer
note
on
the
table
there
a
warning
that
the
article
stolen
from
its
had
better
be
returned
and
under
it
a
reply
printed
in
saying
it
would
be
returned
i
could
make
head
or
tail
of
the
business
i
judged
the
part
to
have
been
left
by
the
chinese
but
who
had
scribbled
the
other
was
a
mystery
at
any
rate
i
concluded
that
would
probably
be
the
crucial
time
and
determined
to
get
in
ahead
of
every
one
else
the
storm
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
to
me
as
it
concealed
things
so
well
and
about
nine
i
was
on
the
spot
proceeding
to
dig
down
by
the
old
log
pretty
soon
i
realized
though
that
there
was
some
one
else
around
and
just
as
i
unearthed
the
bag
which
been
mysteriously
returned
to
its
you
appeared
out
of
somewhere
young
man
fell
on
me
like
a
thousand
of
bricks
and
we
had
a
grand
old
tussle
i
give
you
credit
for
being
wrestler
but
i
was
getting
the
best
of
it
when
along
came
you
others
with
that
terrible
beast
and
did
the
business
for
me
i
thought
all
along
though
that
you
ted
were
one
of
the
chinamen
but
that
person
must
have
been
on
the
scene
also
probably
lurking
in
the
shelter
of
the
bungalow
and
watching
the
fracas
and
when
your
electric
light
blazed
on
the
scene
miss
he
turned
to
phyllis
he
no
doubt
saw
the
bag
in
my
hand
then
when
the
light
went
out
for
a
moment
he
rushed
in
and
grabbed
the
prize
and
was
off
while
we
two
were
so
busy
with
one
another
it
was
a
losing
game
all
around
while
i
was
in
the
village
i
my
department
in
new
york
to
meet
his
train
when
it
got
in
and
arrest
him
if
they
could
find
him
and
search
him
at
once
but
after
i
been
to
the
doctor
i
had
a
long
session
there
i
them
again
and
heard
that
the
train
had
been
met
but
no
one
answering
such
description
as
i
could
give
had
got
off
no
doubt
he
was
canny
enough
to
get
off
at
some
station
short
of
new
york
and
so
was
lost
to
sight
well
the
prize
is
lost
for
this
time
but
perhaps
we
can
pick
up
the
trail
again
at
any
rate
gaines
is
probably
free
for
they
promised
to
release
him
as
soon
as
the
letters
were
obtained
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
leslie
got
up
from
her
chair
and
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
when
she
returned
she
laid
a
dark
bundle
in
the
lap
of
eileen
i
guess
the
prize
was
found
some
time
ago
she
remarked
quietly
suppose
you
open
that
bag
and
see
eileen
and
amid
an
astounded
silence
eileen
fingers
managed
to
unloose
the
fastening
of
the
bag
and
insert
themselves
in
its
depths
then
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
she
drew
out
and
held
up
for
all
to
view
the
bronze
box
that
had
caused
all
the
disturbance
the
dragon
secret
the
complicated
explanations
were
all
over
at
last
and
the
curious
fragmentary
story
was
pieced
together
detective
barnes
took
up
the
little
bronze
box
and
examined
it
carefully
experimenting
as
they
all
had
done
to
find
a
way
of
opening
it
and
of
course
unsuccessfully
there
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
though
remarked
ted
about
that
queer
note
how
and
why
and
by
whom
was
it
left
originally
it
was
written
on
thin
paper
replied
the
detective
and
i
can
only
guess
that
the
foreigners
left
it
there
though
probably
not
on
their
first
trip
that
afternoon
no
doubt
they
either
went
to
the
village
or
more
likely
returned
to
the
city
to
talk
it
over
perhaps
with
gaines
and
he
supposing
i
had
long
since
captured
the
prize
and
to
put
them
off
the
scent
suggested
that
some
one
nearby
may
have
been
meddling
with
the
matter
and
that
they
leave
a
warning
for
them
i
feel
rather
certain
he
must
have
done
this
to
gain
time
for
he
knew
that
if
i
had
found
the
thing
i
would
immediately
set
about
having
him
released
and
he
must
have
wondered
why
i
had
done
so
perhaps
he
thought
i
was
having
difficulty
locating
the
house
where
they
had
him
hidden
but
great
scott
that
makes
me
think
they
must
by
this
time
have
discovered
the
trick
you
played
miss
phyllis
and
be
jumping
mad
over
having
been
so
fooled
perhaps
they
think
gaines
is
responsible
for
it
and
they
certainly
be
making
it
hot
for
i
must
get
to
the
city
immediately
and
get
him
out
of
that
hole
ought
to
waste
another
minute
if
you
can
spare
your
car
miss
eileen
i
like
to
run
up
to
the
city
with
it
as
i
know
there
are
no
more
trains
i
guarantee
to
fetch
it
and
gaines
both
back
in
the
morning
you
certainly
may
have
it
replied
eileen
and
you
may
take
me
with
you
and
leave
me
at
the
hospital
on
the
way
grandfather
must
know
of
this
at
once
i
positive
he
recover
now
since
the
worry
is
all
over
but
first
would
you
all
like
to
see
something
i
happen
to
know
the
secret
of
opening
this
box
grandfather
showed
it
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
he
used
to
let
me
play
with
it
she
took
a
pin
from
her
dress
inserted
it
into
the
carved
eye
of
the
dragon
and
pressed
it
in
a
certain
fashion
and
the
lid
of
the
bronze
box
flew
up
they
all
pressed
forward
eagerly
and
gazed
in
there
lay
the
packet
of
foreign
letters
safe
and
sound
eileen
lifted
them
and
looked
curiously
underneath
nothing
else
was
in
the
box
except
some
strange
thin
bits
of
yellow
foreign
paper
covered
with
vague
pictures
and
curious
chinese
characters
they
seemed
to
be
so
thin
and
old
as
to
be
almost
falling
to
pieces
i
do
know
what
things
are
she
remarked
but
they
probably
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
anyway
grandfather
was
always
picking
up
queer
old
things
on
his
travels
but
he
must
have
thought
them
interesting
or
he
never
would
have
kept
them
in
here
but
we
must
go
now
she
ended
closing
the
box
and
i
see
you
dear
people
all
this
has
surely
been
a
wonderful
night
but
just
as
she
was
ready
to
go
she
said
do
show
me
the
dusty
shelf
where
this
was
hidden
please
and
then
as
she
stood
gazing
up
at
it
she
exclaimed
to
think
that
it
lay
here
behind
those
old
kitchen
things
all
the
time
we
were
so
madly
hunting
for
it
but
perhaps
it
was
the
safest
place
after
all
the
two
girls
escorted
eileen
and
barnes
to
the
door
ted
offering
to
see
them
to
the
car
as
they
came
out
on
the
porch
leslie
uttered
a
little
cry
of
delight
the
storm
which
all
had
momentarily
forgotten
in
the
later
excitement
was
over
the
ragged
clouds
were
driving
by
in
a
strong
northwest
wind
and
a
few
stars
could
be
seen
peeping
through
the
rifts
while
best
of
all
the
water
had
already
retreated
several
feet
though
the
crash
of
the
breakers
was
still
tremendous
as
leslie
and
phyllis
returned
to
the
room
they
were
startled
to
see
aunt
marcia
in
a
peering
out
of
the
door
of
her
room
and
blinking
sleepily
what
on
earth
are
you
two
girls
doing
up
at
this
unearthly
hour
she
inquired
i
woke
and
thought
i
heard
voices
and
came
out
to
see
oh
we
been
talking
and
watching
the
storm
laughed
leslie
all
over
now
and
the
stars
are
shining
you
better
go
back
to
bed
aunt
marcia
the
fire
out
and
it
very
chilly
and
as
the
good
lady
turned
back
into
her
room
leslie
whispered
to
phyllis
and
she
slept
through
all
and
never
knew
how
can
i
be
thankful
enough
chapter
xix
the
biggest
surprise
of
all
phyllis
i
got
a
nibble
phyllis
i
believe
i
can
land
him
too
and
it
will
be
the
first
i
really
managed
to
catch
leslie
began
to
play
her
line
her
hands
fairly
trembling
with
excitement
the
two
girls
and
ted
stood
at
the
ocean
edge
almost
directly
in
front
of
the
bungalows
whiling
away
a
glorious
crisp
afternoon
in
striving
to
induce
the
reluctant
fish
to
bite
for
some
reason
or
other
they
seemed
remarkably
shy
that
day
leslie
nibble
had
been
the
first
suggestion
of
possible
luck
just
as
she
was
cautiously
beginning
to
reel
in
her
line
a
pair
of
hands
was
clasped
over
her
eyes
and
a
gay
voice
laughed
guess
who
eileen
cried
leslie
joyfully
forgetting
all
about
her
nibble
oh
but
it
good
to
see
you
we
missed
you
so
since
you
left
where
you
come
from
grandfather
and
i
motored
down
replied
eileen
as
they
all
crowded
round
her
to
stay
over
night
at
aunt
sally
in
the
village
he
going
to
drive
out
here
a
little
later
with
geoffrey
at
the
wheel
because
he
wants
to
see
you
people
you
know
we
sail
for
england
on
saturday
and
he
says
he
does
intend
to
leave
before
he
has
a
chance
to
greet
the
friends
who
did
so
much
for
him
you
no
idea
how
much
better
he
is
he
began
to
pick
up
the
moment
i
told
him
the
news
that
night
and
in
the
two
weeks
since
he
been
like
another
person
but
he
hates
it
in
new
york
and
it
does
agree
with
him
and
he
just
wanted
to
come
down
here
once
more
before
we
left
but
how
did
get
here
if
he
coming
later
in
the
car
demanded
phyllis
oh
i
of
course
it
was
a
glorious
day
for
it
aunt
sally
wondered
so
to
see
me
taking
the
air
in
anything
but
that
car
what
a
dear
she
is
and
how
scandalously
i
had
to
treat
her
when
i
stayed
there
before
but
the
dear
lady
never
suspected
that
i
was
in
an
agony
of
worry
and
suspense
all
the
time
and
did
dare
to
be
nice
to
her
for
fear
just
be
tempted
to
give
way
and
tell
the
whole
secret
i
used
to
long
to
throw
myself
in
her
lap
and
on
her
shoulder
i
made
it
all
up
with
her
since
though
there
grandfather
now
come
up
to
the
veranda
all
of
you
because
he
not
strong
enough
yet
to
walk
on
the
sand
they
hurried
up
to
the
house
and
got
there
in
time
for
eileen
to
make
the
introductions
they
were
all
deeply
attracted
to
the
tall
stooping
gentleman
who
greeted
them
so
cordially
as
if
they
were
old
and
valued
friends
instead
of
such
recent
acquaintances
i
going
to
ask
you
to
let
me
sit
awhile
on
your
front
veranda
he
said
i
want
to
get
a
last
impression
of
this
lovely
spot
to
carry
away
with
me
to
england
also
i
would
like
to
have
a
chat
with
you
young
folks
and
tell
you
how
much
i
appreciate
what
you
all
did
for
us
rather
embarrassed
by
his
suggestion
that
there
was
anything
to
thank
them
for
leslie
led
him
through
the
house
to
the
veranda
facing
the
ocean
here
aunt
marcia
sat
wrapped
to
the
eyes
enjoying
the
late
october
sunshine
the
invigorating
salt
air
and
the
indescribable
beauty
of
the
changeful
ocean
leslie
had
long
since
very
cautiously
and
gradually
revealed
to
her
the
story
of
their
adventure
at
curlew
nest
so
carefully
had
she
done
so
that
any
possible
alarm
miss
marcia
might
have
experienced
was
swallowed
up
in
wonder
at
the
marvelous
way
in
which
it
had
all
turned
out
leslie
now
introduced
ramsay
and
they
all
gathered
around
him
as
he
settled
himself
to
enjoy
the
view
he
chatted
a
while
with
miss
marcia
compared
notes
with
her
on
the
effect
of
the
climate
on
her
health
and
his
own
then
turned
to
the
young
folks
it
is
quite
useless
for
me
he
began
to
try
to
express
my
appreciation
of
all
you
people
have
done
for
eileen
and
myself
in
the
little
matter
of
the
bronze
box
but
we
must
tell
you
interrupted
phyllis
eagerly
that
we
going
to
sail
under
any
false
colors
we
found
that
little
box
or
rather
rags
here
found
it
and
we
did
have
a
notion
of
course
to
whom
it
could
belong
and
we
were
just
wild
to
get
it
open
and
see
what
was
in
it
when
we
could
manage
that
we
hid
it
away
in
the
safest
place
we
could
think
of
to
wait
for
what
would
happen
i
afraid
we
did
make
any
very
desperate
hunt
for
the
owner
and
when
we
suspected
that
eileen
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
i
ashamed
to
say
that
we
would
give
it
up
to
her
at
first
because
we
were
annoyed
at
the
way
she
acted
we
did
understand
of
course
but
that
does
excuse
it
all
that
you
say
may
be
true
smiled
ramsay
but
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
you
delivered
it
up
the
moment
you
discovered
the
rightful
owner
and
miss
phyllis
clever
little
ruse
of
burying
the
false
box
probably
saved
geoffrey
a
bad
time
for
if
those
fellows
found
there
that
night
they
would
certainly
have
made
it
hot
for
him
as
it
was
it
gained
us
so
much
time
that
detective
barnes
had
a
chance
to
get
my
man
out
of
their
clutches
before
they
had
done
him
any
damage
though
they
were
furious
at
being
duped
they
all
safely
in
jail
now
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
from
them
of
course
the
principal
who
hired
them
is
safe
over
in
china
but
he
did
gain
point
and
that
the
main
thing
as
for
the
letters
i
concluded
that
after
all
my
ideas
as
to
how
to
keep
them
safely
were
out
of
date
and
they
have
long
since
been
forwarded
to
washington
in
care
of
barnes
and
are
now
in
the
hands
of
my
country
representative
there
i
shall
not
concern
myself
any
further
about
their
security
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
the
little
bronze
casket
then
he
went
on
this
little
box
has
had
some
strange
adventures
in
its
day
but
nothing
stranger
than
the
one
it
has
just
passed
through
it
has
however
something
else
in
it
that
i
thought
might
be
of
interest
to
you
and
so
i
have
brought
it
along
and
will
explain
about
it
he
opened
the
box
in
the
same
way
as
eileen
had
done
and
revealed
to
their
curious
gaze
the
fragile
old
bits
of
paper
they
had
seen
on
that
eventful
night
he
took
them
out
fingered
them
thoughtfully
and
handed
one
to
each
of
the
four
young
folks
there
is
a
strange
little
adventure
connected
with
these
that
perhaps
you
may
be
interested
to
hear
he
continued
it
happened
when
i
was
passing
through
the
city
of
peking
some
years
ago
during
their
revolution
there
was
a
good
deal
of
lawlessness
rife
at
the
time
and
bands
of
natives
were
running
about
pillaging
and
looting
anything
they
thought
it
safe
to
tamper
with
one
day
in
one
of
the
open
places
of
the
city
i
happened
along
just
in
time
to
see
ten
or
a
dozen
lawless
natives
pulling
from
its
pedestal
a
great
bronze
idol
hideous
as
they
make
that
had
stood
there
probably
for
uncounted
centuries
when
they
got
it
to
the
ground
they
found
it
to
be
hollow
inside
as
most
of
the
really
ancient
ones
are
and
filled
with
all
manner
of
articles
representing
the
sacrifices
that
had
been
made
to
it
through
the
ages
and
placed
inside
it
by
their
priests
these
articles
included
everything
from
real
jewels
of
undoubted
value
to
imitations
of
food
a
device
the
chinese
often
use
in
sacrificing
to
the
idols
of
course
the
mob
made
an
immediate
grab
for
the
jewels
but
it
had
begun
to
make
my
blood
boil
to
see
them
making
off
with
so
much
unlawful
booty
so
almost
without
thinking
i
snatched
out
my
revolver
placed
myself
in
front
of
the
pile
and
shouted
to
them
that
i
would
shoot
the
first
one
who
laid
a
finger
on
the
stuff
and
in
the
same
breath
i
sent
geoffrey
hurrying
to
find
some
of
the
city
authorities
to
come
and
rescue
what
would
probably
be
some
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
gems
fortunately
i
was
armed
with
an
effective
weapon
and
they
were
not
so
i
managed
to
hold
the
fort
till
geoffrey
returned
with
the
authorities
and
on
seeing
them
the
mob
promptly
melted
away
the
mandarin
wanted
to
present
me
with
some
of
the
jewels
in
gratitude
for
my
services
but
i
had
no
wish
for
them
and
only
asked
permission
to
take
with
me
a
few
of
these
little
scraps
of
paper
which
had
been
among
the
medley
of
articles
in
the
idol
interior
of
course
they
assented
deeming
me
no
doubt
a
very
stupid
devil
to
be
so
easily
satisfied
i
have
carried
them
about
with
me
for
several
years
and
now
i
am
going
to
give
them
to
you
young
folks
one
to
each
of
you
as
a
little
token
of
my
gratitude
for
your
invaluable
help
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
smiling
benignly
while
he
watched
the
bewilderment
on
all
their
faces
ted
phyllis
and
leslie
were
striving
to
hide
this
under
a
polite
assumption
of
intense
gratitude
though
they
were
a
bit
puzzled
as
to
why
he
should
choose
of
all
people
who
had
no
very
great
interest
in
such
things
as
recipients
of
this
special
gift
but
his
own
granddaughter
was
under
less
compulsion
to
assume
what
she
did
not
feel
this
is
awfully
good
of
you
granddaddy
she
cried
but
i
honestly
see
what
the
big
idea
is
i
think
that
story
of
yours
was
ripping
but
i
do
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
this
little
bit
of
paper
it
seems
so
old
and
frail
too
that
i
almost
afraid
a
breath
will
blow
it
to
pieces
i
really
think
it
will
be
safer
in
your
care
he
was
still
smiling
indulgently
i
suspected
that
the
outspoken
eileen
would
voice
the
general
opinion
of
this
gift
i
do
mind
it
in
the
least
and
i
do
blame
you
a
bit
for
feeling
a
trifle
bewildered
about
the
matter
but
i
have
told
you
the
whole
story
yet
to
continue
as
i
said
before
i
carried
these
bits
of
paper
around
with
me
for
a
number
of
years
simply
because
they
reminded
me
of
my
little
adventure
then
one
day
early
this
past
summer
on
the
steamer
coming
across
the
pacific
i
chanced
to
meet
a
man
connected
with
the
british
museum
whom
i
soon
discovered
to
be
one
of
the
principal
experts
on
chinese
antiquities
and
it
occurred
to
me
to
show
him
these
bits
of
paper
and
ask
if
he
could
imagine
what
they
were
he
examined
them
carefully
and
then
came
to
me
in
great
delight
declaring
that
they
certainly
were
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
the
oldest
existing
specimens
of
chinese
money
and
he
added
moreover
that
the
british
museum
had
no
specimens
in
its
possession
as
old
as
these
and
declared
that
he
believed
the
museum
would
be
delighted
to
buy
them
probably
for
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
apiece
the
listening
four
gasped
and
stared
at
him
incredulously
but
he
went
on
undisturbed
i
said
i
would
think
the
matter
over
and
decide
when
i
reached
england
but
meantime
for
reasons
which
i
have
already
enlarged
upon
i
have
decided
instead
to
give
them
to
you
as
a
little
testimonial
of
my
deep
gratitude
if
by
any
chance
should
decide
that
you
would
prefer
to
have
the
money
i
will
attempt
to
negotiate
the
sale
for
you
when
i
reach
london
and
he
got
no
further
for
with
a
whoop
of
joy
ted
sprang
forward
and
laid
his
bit
in
ramsay
lap
and
the
others
followed
his
example
striving
very
inadequately
to
express
their
wonder
and
delight
but
he
interrupted
them
smilingly
i
should
like
to
inquire
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
what
form
of
investment
each
one
of
you
expects
to
make
with
the
sum
you
receive
do
think
me
too
inquisitive
please
it
just
an
old
man
curiosity
i
decided
already
cried
eileen
i
going
to
spend
mine
on
another
trip
over
here
in
the
spring
to
visit
you
girls
and
i
going
to
bring
mother
with
me
i
would
have
got
here
this
time
if
it
had
been
for
grandfather
for
daddy
simply
put
his
foot
down
and
said
he
afford
it
and
next
year
grandfather
may
be
in
timbuctoo
or
somewhere
like
it
and
i
would
have
a
chance
but
i
just
to
see
you
all
again
soon
for
you
the
best
friends
i
ever
made
and
i
going
to
save
mine
for
some
extra
expensive
courses
in
chemical
engineering
in
college
that
i
never
supposed
i
could
afford
to
take
declared
ted
i
expected
i
have
to
go
into
business
after
i
graduated
for
a
year
or
two
till
i
scraped
up
enough
but
now
i
can
go
right
on
of
course
i
get
my
music
now
cried
phyllis
and
i
the
happiest
girl
alive
well
it
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
say
that
now
little
ralph
will
have
his
chance
to
be
strong
and
well
like
other
boys
murmured
leslie
tears
of
joy
standing
in
her
eyes
then
to
ease
the
tension
of
the
almost
too
happy
strain
ramsay
continued
but
there
is
another
member
of
this
party
that
it
would
not
do
to
forget
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
handsome
leather
and
silver
called
rags
over
to
him
and
as
the
dog
ambled
up
gravely
addressed
him
kindly
accept
this
token
of
my
immense
gratitude
and
allow
me
to
clasp
it
about
your
neck
rags
submitted
gravely
while
his
old
collar
was
removed
and
the
new
one
put
in
place
and
immediately
after
began
to
make
frantic
efforts
to
get
it
off
over
his
head
but
ramsay
only
laughed
and
held
up
a
five
dollar
bill
adding
i
realize
that
you
do
not
entirely
appreciate
this
gift
at
present
in
fact
i
sympathize
with
you
in
thinking
it
a
decided
nuisance
but
here
is
something
else
that
may
soothe
your
sorrow
a
bill
to
be
devoted
exclusively
to
the
purchase
of
luscious
steaks
tender
chops
and
juicy
bones
for
your
solitary
delectation
amid
the
general
laughter
that
followed
he
added
and
now
may
i
ask
that
you
escort
me
over
to
the
veranda
of
curlew
nest
i
have
a
great
desire
to
walk
up
and
down
on
that
porch
for
a
few
moments
and
think
of
all
the
strange
adventures
of
which
that
delightful
little
bungalow
has
been
the
scene
and
accompanied
by
rags
still
striving
madly
to
scrape
off
his
new
collar
by
rubbing
it
in
the
sand
they
escorted
their
guest
to
nest
