it
was
elder
taylor
intention
to
superintend
the
publishing
of
government
of
in
person
previous
to
his
departure
for
great
salt
lake
city
last
spring
but
the
numerous
cares
attending
the
french
and
german
missions
of
which
he
was
president
the
translation
of
the
book
of
mormon
into
the
french
and
german
languages
the
establishment
of
du
at
paris
and
at
hamburg
together
with
a
multitude
of
other
business
connected
with
the
welfare
of
the
kingdom
of
god
rendered
it
impossible
the
manuscript
was
therefore
handed
to
me
by
elder
taylor
with
a
request
to
superintend
the
printing
of
the
work
which
i
have
done
to
the
best
of
my
ability
considering
the
disadvantages
arising
from
the
author
absence
during
the
reading
of
the
proofs
i
believe
it
is
as
correctly
rendered
as
was
possible
from
a
manuscript
copy
the
work
is
now
before
the
public
and
from
one
portion
at
least
it
will
meet
with
a
cordial
reception
treating
as
it
does
upon
the
theme
most
dear
to
their
hearts
the
reign
of
righteousness
and
peace
from
other
portions
it
will
meet
with
varied
reception
but
will
nevertheless
lead
the
minds
of
all
to
contemplate
the
glory
of
that
time
when
the
messiah
even
jesus
shall
come
with
all
his
holy
angels
and
sit
upon
the
throne
of
his
glory
and
govern
all
nations

the
wisdom
order
and
harmony
of
the
government
of
god
the
kingdom
of
god
is
the
government
of
god
on
the
earth
or
in
the
heavens
the
earth
and
all
the
planetary
systems
are
governed
by
the
lord
they
are
upheld
by
his
power
and
are
sustained
directed
and
controlled
by
his
will
we
are
told
that
by
him
were
all
things
created
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
visible
and
invisible
whether
they
be
thrones
or
dominions
or
principalities
or
powers
all
things
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
and
he
is
before
all
things
and
by
him
all
things
consist
a
collos
i
if
all
things
visible
and
invisible
are
made
by
and
for
him
he
governs
and
sustains
all
worlds
to
us
known
together
with
the
earth
on
which
we
live
if
he
governs
them
they
are
under
his
dominion
subject
to
his
laws
and
controlled
by
his
will
and
power
footnote
a
i
wish
here
to
be
understood
that
at
present
i
am
writing
to
believers
in
the
bible
i
may
hereafter
give
my
reasons
for
this
faith
at
the
present
i
refer
to
the
scriptures
without
this
if
the
planets
move
beautifully
and
harmoniously
in
their
several
spheres
that
beauty
and
harmony
are
the
result
of
the
intelligence
and
wisdom
that
exist
in
his
mind
if
on
this
earth
we
have
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
seed
time
and
harvest
with
the
various
changes
of
the
seasons
this
regularity
beauty
order
and
harmony
are
the
effects
of
the
wisdom
of
god
there
are
two
kinds
of
rule
on
the
earth
one
with
which
man
has
nothing
directly
to
do
another
in
which
he
is
intimately
concerned
the
first
of
these
applies
to
the
works
of
god
alone
and
his
government
and
control
of
those
works
the
second
to
the
moral
government
wherein
man
is
made
an
agent
there
is
a
very
striking
difference
between
the
two
and
the
comparison
is
certainly
not
creditable
to
man
and
however
he
may
feel
disposed
to
vaunt
himself
of
his
intelligence
when
he
reflects
he
will
feel
like
job
did
when
he
said
xlii
i
abhor
myself
and
repent
in
dust
and
ashes
in
god
government
there
is
perfect
order
harmony
beauty
magnificence
and
grandeur
in
the
government
of
man
confusion
disorder
instability
misery
discord
and
death
in
the
first
the
most
consummate
wisdom
and
power
are
manifested
in
the
second
ignorance
imbecility
and
weakness
the
first
displays
the
comprehension
light
glory
beneficence
and
intelligence
of
god
the
second
the
folly
littleness
darkness
and
incompetency
of
man
the
contemplation
of
the
first
elevates
the
mind
expands
the
capacity
produces
grateful
reflections
and
fills
the
mind
with
wonder
admiration
and
enlivening
hopes
the
contemplation
of
the
second
produces
doubt
distrust
and
uncertainty
and
fills
the
mind
with
gloomy
apprehensions
in
a
word
the
one
is
the
work
of
god
and
the
other
that
of
man
in
order
to
present
the
subject
in
a
clear
light
i
shall
briefly
point
out
some
of
the
leading
features
of
the
two
governments
the
first
then
is
that
over
which
god
has
the
sole
control
such
as
the
heavens
and
the
earth
for
he
governs
in
the
heavens
above
and
in
the
earth
beneath
it
may
be
well
here
to
say
a
few
words
on
his
moral
government
in
the
heavens
all
we
can
learn
of
that
is
very
imperfectly
set
forth
in
the
scriptures
it
would
seem
however
that
all
was
perfect
order
for
he
spake
and
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
and
he
divided
the
light
from
the
darkness
he
spake
and
the
waters
were
gathered
together
and
the
dry
land
appeared
and
in
the
creation
of
the
fish
the
fowls
the
beasts
the
creeping
things
and
man
it
was
done
in
the
councils
of
god
the
word
was
let
us
do
this
and
it
was
done
it
would
seem
then
that
that
government
is
perfect
in
its
operations
for
all
the
mandates
of
god
are
carried
out
with
the
greatest
exactitude
and
perfection
god
spake
chaos
heard
and
the
world
was
formed
we
find
also
that
transgression
is
punished
when
satan
rebelled
he
was
cast
out
of
heaven
and
with
him
those
who
sinned
here
then
in
these
things
consummate
wisdom
was
manifested
and
power
to
carry
it
out
the
plan
of
redemption
was
also
made
thousands
of
years
ago
jesus
is
spoken
of
by
the
prophets
as
being
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
creation
of
the
world
the
future
destiny
of
this
earth
is
also
spoken
of
by
prophecy
the
binding
of
satan
the
destruction
and
redemption
of
the
world
its
celestial
destiny
its
becoming
as
a
sea
of
glass
the
descent
of
the
new
jerusalem
from
heaven
the
destruction
of
iniquity
by
a
power
exercised
in
the
heavens
associated
with
one
on
the
earth
and
a
time
is
spoken
of
where
john
says
every
creature
which
is
in
heaven
and
on
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
such
as
are
in
the
sea
and
all
that
are
in
them
heard
i
saying
blessing
and
honor
and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
ever
rev
but
i
shall
let
this
pass
for
the
present
and
content
myself
with
saying
on
this
subject
that
in
the
councils
of
god
in
the
eternal
world
all
these
things
were
understood
for
if
he
gave
prophets
wisdom
to
testify
of
these
things
they
obtained
their
knowledge
from
him
and
he
could
not
impart
what
he
did
not
know
but
known
unto
god
are
all
his
works
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
acts
xv
god
then
has
a
moral
government
in
the
heavens
and
it
is
the
development
of
that
government
that
is
manifested
in
the
works
of
creation
as
paul
says
the
invisible
things
of
him
from
the
creation
of
the
world
are
clearly
seen
being
understood
by
the
things
that
are
made
even
his
eternal
power
and
godhead
romans
i
but
when
we
speak
of
the
heavens
we
mean
also
the
planetary
system
for
the
world
and
other
worlds
are
governed
by
principles
independent
of
man
the
power
that
causes
this
earth
to
roll
on
its
axis
and
regulates
the
planets
in
their
diurnal
and
annual
motions
is
beyond
man
control
their
revolutions
and
spheres
are
fixed
by
god
and
they
are
so
beautifully
arranged
and
nicely
balanced
that
an
astronomer
can
calculate
the
return
of
a
planet
scores
of
years
beforehand
with
the
greatest
precision
and
accuracy
and
who
can
contemplate
without
admiration
those
stupendous
worlds
rolling
through
the
immensity
of
space
at
such
an
amazing
velocity
moving
regularly
in
their
given
spheres
without
coming
into
collision
and
reflect
that
they
have
done
so
for
thousands
of
years
our
earth
has
its
day
and
night
summer
and
winter
and
seed
time
and
harvest
well
may
the
poet
say
that
they
proclaim
for
ever
as
they
shine
the
hand
that
made
us
is
divine
and
here
let
me
remark
how
different
is
this
to
the
works
of
man
we
see
then
the
power
of
god
manifested
in
their
preservation
and
guidance
but
when
we
reflect
a
little
further
that
while
our
planetary
system
rolls
in
perfect
order
round
the
sun
there
are
other
systems
which
perform
their
revolutions
round
their
suns
and
the
whole
of
these
our
system
with
its
centre
and
other
systems
with
their
centres
roll
round
another
grand
centre
and
the
whole
of
those
and
innumerable
others
equally
as
great
stupendous
and
magnificent
roll
round
another
more
great
glorious
and
resplendent
till
numbers
magnificence
and
glory
drown
the
thought
we
are
led
to
exclaim
with
the
prophet
o
the
depth
of
the
riches
both
of
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
god
how
unsearchable
are
his
judgements
and
his
ways
past
finding
out
romans
xi
without
referring
again
to
the
motions
of
our
earth
and
the
beautiful
regularity
and
precision
of
the
whole
of
this
elegant
machinery
we
will
turn
our
attention
a
little
to
the
works
of
creation
as
found
on
the
earth
the
make
construction
and
adaptation
of
each
for
its
proper
sphere
are
the
work
of
god
and
they
are
all
controlled
by
his
wisdom
and
power
independent
of
man
in
the
conformation
of
the
birds
the
beasts
the
fishes
the
reptiles
the
grains
herbs
plants
and
trees
we
see
a
striking
exemplification
of
this
fact
no
matter
which
way
we
turn
our
attention
the
same
order
and
intelligence
are
displayed
the
fish
in
their
organization
are
peculiarly
adapted
to
their
proper
element
the
birds
and
beasts
to
theirs
the
amphibious
animals
to
theirs
the
nicely
organized
machinery
of
their
bodies
their
bones
muscles
skins
feathers
scales
or
hair
the
formation
of
their
bodies
their
manner
of
living
together
with
the
nature
of
their
food
and
their
particular
adaptation
to
the
various
elements
and
climates
which
they
occupy
are
all
so
many
marked
evidences
of
skill
forethought
intelligence
and
power
we
will
here
notice
a
few
examples
plunge
bird
beast
or
man
into
the
water
and
let
them
remain
there
and
they
will
soon
die
take
a
fish
out
of
the
water
and
death
ensues
yet
all
are
happy
and
move
with
perfect
enjoyment
in
their
proper
spheres
elevate
a
man
beast
or
fish
into
the
air
and
let
them
fall
and
they
will
be
bruised
to
death
but
the
bird
with
its
wings
light
bones
and
fragile
body
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
aerial
element
in
which
it
moves
and
is
perfectly
at
home
while
the
brute
creation
and
men
feel
as
much
so
on
the
earth
again
their
habits
food
coatings
or
coverings
digestive
powers
and
the
organization
of
their
systems
are
all
peculiarly
adapted
to
their
several
situations
the
same
principle
is
developed
in
their
arrangement
and
position
on
the
earth
those
that
inhabit
a
southern
climate
are
peculiarly
adapted
to
that
situation
while
those
that
inhabit
a
northern
are
equally
fitted
for
theirs
take
the
reindeer
and
polar
bear
to
the
torrid
zone
and
they
would
be
out
of
their
proper
latitude
and
would
probably
die
remove
the
elephant
lion
or
tiger
to
iceland
or
greenland
and
leave
them
to
their
own
resources
and
they
would
inevitably
perish
we
will
notice
for
a
moment
the
construction
of
their
systems
each
one
is
possessed
with
muscular
strength
or
agility
according
to
its
position
wants
or
dangers
and
there
is
a
beauty
a
symmetry
and
a
perfection
about
all
god
works
which
baffle
and
defy
human
intelligence
to
copy
an
artist
is
considered
talented
if
he
can
make
after
years
of
toil
a
striking
likeness
of
any
of
those
things
either
on
canvas
or
in
marble
but
when
he
has
done
it
is
only
a
dead
outline
remove
a
little
paint
or
tear
the
canvas
and
its
beauty
is
destroyed
break
the
arm
of
a
statue
and
we
see
nothing
but
a
mutilated
stone
but
take
a
man
for
example
and
remove
the
skin
there
is
still
order
and
beauty
remove
the
flesh
there
is
still
workmanship
and
skill
and
the
bones
the
flesh
the
muscles
the
arteries
and
veins
and
the
nerves
and
the
lungs
not
to
forget
the
exquisite
fineness
of
the
sensitive
organs
manifesting
a
skill
a
forethought
a
wisdom
and
a
power
as
much
above
that
of
man
as
the
heavens
are
above
the
earth
we
see
the
power
wisdom
and
government
of
god
displayed
in
the
amazing
strength
of
some
of
the
largest
of
the
brute
creation
as
also
in
the
fineness
and
delicacy
of
the
arrangement
of
the
smaller
and
while
we
admire
the
stupendous
power
of
the
elephant
we
are
equally
struck
with
the
fineness
delicacy
and
beauty
of
some
of
the
smaller
insects
the
prescience
and
intelligence
of
god
are
as
much
manifested
in
arranging
the
bones
muscles
arteries
and
digestive
organs
of
the
smallest
animaculae
as
in
the
construction
of
the
horse
rhinoceros
elephant
or
whale
i
might
touch
upon
the
organization
of
plants
herbs
trees
and
fruits
their
various
compositions
modes
of
nourishment
manner
of
propagating
their
kind
but
enough
has
already
been
said
upon
this
subject
it
is
one
that
no
one
will
dispute
upon
jew
and
gentile
black
and
white
christian
and
heathen
philosopher
and
fool
all
have
one
faith
on
this
subject
i
have
briefly
touched
upon
it
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
in
a
clear
light
the
imbecility
and
weakness
of
man
for
wherever
we
turn
our
attention
we
see
power
wisdom
prescience
order
forethought
beauty
grandeur
and
magnificence
these
are
the
works
of
god
and
shew
his
skill
workmanship
glory
and
intelligence
they
reflect
his
divine
power
and
shew
in
unmistakeable
characters
the
wisdom
of
his
government
and
the
order
that
prevails
in
that
part
of
creation
over
which
he
has
the
sole
and
unlimited
control
we
can
perceive
very
clearly
that
what
god
has
done
is
rightly
done
it
is
not
governed
by
instability
and
disorder
but
continues
from
eternity
to
eternity
to
bear
the
impress
of
jehovah
chapter
ii
the
government
of
man
we
will
now
turn
our
attention
a
little
to
the
government
of
man
and
see
how
that
will
compare
with
the
foregoing
for
man
stands
at
the
head
of
this
beautiful
creation
he
is
endued
with
intelligence
and
capacity
for
improvement
he
is
placed
as
a
moral
agent
and
has
the
materials
put
into
his
hands
to
work
with
the
works
of
his
father
as
a
pattern
the
conduct
of
many
of
the
inferior
creation
as
an
example
and
might
make
the
earth
a
garden
a
paradise
a
place
of
uninterrupted
happiness
and
felicity
a
heaven
below
and
if
god
had
not
delegated
this
moral
agency
and
power
to
man
and
thus
given
him
the
privilege
in
part
of
being
the
arbiter
of
his
own
destiny
such
it
would
have
been
to
this
day
like
the
eden
from
which
he
was
ejected
because
of
his
transgression
for
he
had
everything
placed
within
his
power
and
was
made
lord
of
the
creation
the
beasts
birds
fish
and
fowl
were
placed
under
his
control
the
earth
yielded
plenty
for
his
wants
and
abounded
in
fruits
grain
herbs
flowers
and
trees
both
to
satisfy
his
hunger
and
to
please
the
sight
taste
and
smell
the
fields
waved
with
plenty
and
produced
a
perennial
harvest
the
fruits
teemed
forth
in
all
their
luscious
varieties
to
satisfy
his
most
capacious
desires
the
flowers
in
all
their
gaiety
beauty
and
richness
delighted
the
eye
while
their
rich
fragrance
filled
the
air
with
odoriferous
perfumes
the
feathered
tribes
with
all
their
gorgeous
plumage
and
variety
of
song
both
pleased
the
eye
and
enchanted
and
charmed
the
ear
the
horse
the
cow
and
other
animals
were
there
to
promote
his
happiness
supply
his
wants
and
make
him
comfortable
and
happy
all
were
under
his
control
to
contribute
to
his
happiness
and
comfort
supply
his
most
extended
desires
and
to
add
to
his
enjoyment
but
with
all
these
privileges
what
is
his
situation
with
celestial
blessings
within
his
reach
he
has
plunged
down
to
the
very
verge
of
hell
and
is
found
in
a
state
of
poverty
confusion
and
distress
he
found
the
earth
an
eden
a
paradise
he
has
filled
it
with
misery
and
woe
and
has
made
it
comparatively
a
howling
wilderness
and
let
us
not
blame
adam
alone
for
this
state
of
things
for
after
his
ejection
from
paradise
the
earth
was
sufficiently
fertile
to
satisfy
all
the
desires
of
man
with
moderate
industry
and
is
at
the
present
day
if
it
were
not
for
the
confusion
that
exists
and
if
men
were
properly
situated
and
its
resources
developd
but
more
of
this
anon
at
present
we
will
examine
some
of
these
evils
and
then
point
out
their
cause
and
the
remedy
we
find
the
world
split
up
and
divided
into
different
nations
having
different
interests
and
different
objects
with
their
religious
and
political
views
as
dissimilar
as
light
and
darkness
all
the
time
jealous
of
each
other
and
watching
each
other
as
so
many
thieves
and
that
man
at
the
present
day
and
it
has
been
the
case
for
ages
is
considered
the
greatest
statesman
who
with
legislation
or
diplomacy
can
make
the
most
advantageous
arrangement
with
or
coerce
by
circumstances
other
nations
into
measures
that
would
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
with
which
he
is
associated
no
matter
how
injurious
it
might
be
to
the
nation
or
nations
concerned
the
measure
that
would
yield
his
nation
an
advantage
might
plunge
another
in
irremediable
misery
while
there
is
no
one
to
act
as
father
and
parent
of
the
whole
and
god
is
lost
sight
of
what
is
it
that
the
private
ambition
of
man
has
not
done
to
satisfy
his
craving
desires
for
the
acquisition
of
territory
and
wealth
and
what
is
falsely
called
and
those
private
jarring
interests
have
kept
the
world
in
one
continual
ferment
and
commotion
from
the
commencement
until
the
present
time
and
the
history
of
the
world
is
a
history
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
nations
of
wars
commotions
and
bloodshed
of
nations
depopulated
and
cities
laid
waste
carnage
destruction
and
death
have
stalked
through
the
earth
exhibiting
their
horrible
forms
in
all
their
cadaverous
shapes
as
though
they
were
the
only
rightful
possessors
deadly
jealousy
fiendish
hate
mortal
combat
and
dying
groans
have
filled
the
earth
and
our
bulwarks
our
chronicles
our
histories
all
bear
testimony
to
this
and
even
our
most
splendid
paintings
engravings
and
statuary
are
living
memorials
of
bloodshed
carnage
and
destruction
instead
of
men
being
honoured
who
have
sought
to
promote
the
happiness
peace
and
wellbeing
of
the
human
family
and
greatness
concentrating
in
that
those
have
been
generally
esteemed
the
most
who
produced
the
most
misery
and
distress
and
were
wholesale
robbers
ravagers
and
murderers
and
from
whence
come
these
things
let
the
apostle
james
answer
from
whence
come
wars
and
fightings
among
you
come
they
not
hence
even
of
your
lusts
that
war
in
your
members
ye
lust
and
have
not
ye
kill
and
desire
to
have
and
can
not
obtain
ye
fight
and
war
yet
ye
have
not
because
ye
ask
not
ye
ask
and
receive
not
because
ye
ask
amiss
that
ye
may
consume
it
upon
your
lusts
james
iv
here
is
evidently
a
lack
of
that
consummate
wisdom
that
moral
and
physical
control
that
parental
power
which
balances
the
universe
and
directs
the
various
planets
for
let
the
same
recklessness
selfishness
individuality
and
nationality
there
be
manifested
and
we
should
see
the
wildest
confusion
man
has
come
in
contact
with
man
morally
physically
religiously
and
nationally
from
the
foundation
of
the
earth
if
god
works
had
done
so
what
tumult
and
ruin
there
would
have
been
in
the
immensity
of
space
instead
of
the
order
that
now
prevails
man
would
have
been
sometimes
frozen
to
death
and
at
other
times
burned
up
one
or
two
seasons
of
irregularity
even
in
climate
would
depopulate
the
earth
but
what
if
the
planets
irrespective
of
the
power
by
which
they
are
controlled
were
to
rush
wildly
through
space
and
with
their
mighty
impetus
dash
against
each
other
what
fearful
consequences
would
ensue
there
would
be
system
on
system
wrecked
and
world
on
world
what
terrible
destruction
and
ruin
we
have
read
of
earthquakes
destroying
countries
of
wars
depopulating
nations
of
volcanoes
overwhelming
cities
and
of
empires
in
ruin
but
what
would
the
yawning
earthquake
the
bellowing
volcano
the
clang
of
arms
or
a
nation
distress
be
in
comparison
to
a
scene
like
this
system
would
be
shattered
with
system
planet
madly
rush
on
planet
worlds
with
their
inhabitants
would
be
destroyed
and
creations
crumble
into
ruins
there
would
be
truly
a
war
of
planets
a
wreck
of
matter
and
a
crash
of
worlds
these
indeed
would
be
fearful
results
and
shew
plainly
the
distinction
between
the
beautiful
order
of
god
work
and
the
confusion
and
disorder
of
man
god
work
is
perfect
imperfect
the
one
is
the
government
of
god
and
the
other
that
of
man
we
notice
the
same
mismanagement
in
the
arrangement
of
cities
and
nations
we
have
large
cities
containing
immense
numbers
of
human
beings
pent
up
as
it
were
in
one
great
inhaling
a
foetid
unwholesome
atmosphere
impregnated
with
a
thousand
deadly
poisons
millions
of
whom
in
damp
cellars
lonely
garrets
and
pent
up
corners
drag
out
a
miserable
existence
and
their
wan
faces
haggard
countenances
and
looks
tell
but
too
plainly
the
tale
of
their
misery
and
wretchedness
a
degenerate
sickly
puny
race
tread
in
their
steps
inheriting
their
fathers
misery
and
distress
if
we
notice
the
situation
of
the
nations
of
europe
at
the
present
time
we
see
the
land
burthened
with
an
overplus
population
and
groaning
beneath
its
inhabitants
while
the
greatest
industry
perseverance
economy
and
care
do
not
suffice
to
provide
for
the
craving
wants
of
nature
and
so
fearfully
does
this
prevail
in
many
parts
that
parents
are
afraid
to
fulfil
the
first
great
law
of
god
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
by
desperate
circumstances
are
almost
forced
to
the
unnatural
wish
of
not
propagating
their
species
while
corrupted
with
a
correspondent
depravity
with
that
which
reigns
among
nations
they
are
found
using
suicidal
measures
to
prevent
an
otherwise
numerous
progeny
from
increasing
their
father
misery
and
inheriting
his
misfortunes
and
yet
while
this
is
the
case
there
are
immense
districts
of
rich
soil
covering
millions
of
square
miles
inhabited
only
by
a
few
untutored
savages
or
the
wild
beast
of
the
forest
and
such
is
the
infatuation
of
man
that
in
many
districts
of
country
which
were
once
the
seats
of
the
most
powerful
empires
and
where
flourished
the
mightiest
nations
there
is
nothing
but
desolation
and
wildness
such
are
nineveh
and
babylon
on
the
asiatic
continent
and
otolum
and
many
others
discovered
by
stephens
and
catherwood
in
central
america
and
recently
discovered
ruins
unequalled
in
the
old
world
a
little
above
the
head
of
the
california
gulf
not
only
their
cities
but
their
lands
are
desolate
deserted
and
forsaken
and
the
same
evils
that
once
existed
there
are
transferred
to
another
soil
all
bespeaking
plainly
that
we
want
a
great
governing
ruling
principle
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
the
world
and
assist
poor
feeble
erring
humanity
again
if
we
examine
some
of
the
details
of
these
evils
we
shall
see
more
clearly
the
importance
and
necessity
of
a
change
nearly
speaking
in
general
terms
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
engaged
in
a
calling
that
would
be
entirely
useless
if
the
world
were
set
right
if
men
and
nations
instead
of
being
governed
by
their
unruly
passions
covetous
desires
and
ambitious
motives
were
governed
by
the
pure
principles
of
philanthropy
virtue
purity
justice
and
honor
and
were
under
the
guidance
of
a
fatherly
and
intelligent
head
directed
by
that
wisdom
which
governs
the
universe
and
regulates
the
motions
of
the
planetary
systems
there
would
be
no
need
of
so
many
armies
navies
and
police
regulations
which
are
now
necessary
for
the
protection
of
those
several
nations
from
the
aggressions
of
each
other
and
internal
factions
let
any
one
examine
the
position
of
europe
alone
and
he
will
find
this
statement
abundantly
verified
look
at
the
armies
and
navies
of
france
and
england
and
the
confusion
of
germany
also
of
austria
turkey
russia
and
spain
not
to
mention
many
of
the
smaller
nations
and
let
their
armies
their
navies
and
police
be
gathered
together
and
what
an
abundant
host
of
persons
there
would
be
they
would
be
sufficient
to
make
one
of
the
largest
nations
in
the
world
and
what
are
they
doing
to
use
the
mildest
term
watching
each
other
as
a
person
would
watch
a
thief
for
fear
of
being
imposed
upon
and
robbed
or
killed
but
generally
strolling
around
as
the
world
banditti
robbing
plundering
and
committing
aggressions
upon
each
other
and
if
they
have
peace
acquiring
it
by
the
sword
and
if
prevented
from
aggression
and
war
it
is
generally
not
that
they
are
governed
by
just
or
virtuous
principles
but
because
they
are
afraid
that
aggression
might
lead
to
combinations
against
them
which
would
result
in
their
overthrow
and
ruin
in
the
city
of
paris
alone
at
the
present
time
and
its
immediate
environs
there
are
one
hundred
thousand
soldiers
besides
police
to
a
very
great
number
not
to
mention
the
vast
number
of
officers
and
others
suppose
we
add
to
these
their
families
where
they
have
any
and
where
they
have
not
notice
the
vast
amount
of
prostitution
misery
degradation
and
infamy
that
such
an
unnatural
state
of
things
produces
i
give
the
above
as
an
example
of
the
whole
but
here
the
navies
are
not
included
i
say
again
what
are
these
all
doing
they
do
not
raise
corn
to
supply
the
wants
of
men
nor
are
they
occupied
in
any
useful
avocation
but
they
live
and
their
wants
must
be
supplied
by
the
products
of
the
labour
of
others
there
has
to
be
an
immense
amount
of
legislation
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
thing
and
instead
of
having
one
government
of
righteousness
and
the
world
obeying
we
have
scores
of
governments
all
having
to
be
sustained
in
regal
pomp
to
be
equal
to
their
neighbouring
nations
and
all
this
magnificence
and
national
pride
having
to
be
supported
by
the
labour
of
the
people
again
all
these
legislatures
have
to
provide
immense
hosts
of
men
in
the
shape
of
excise
and
police
officers
to
carry
out
their
designs
all
of
whom
and
their
families
help
to
increase
the
burden
till
it
becomes
insupportable
that
together
with
the
unnatural
state
of
society
before
referred
to
in
regard
to
the
situation
of
the
inhabitants
of
cities
and
the
nations
plunges
millions
of
the
human
family
into
a
state
of
hopeless
destitution
misery
and
ruin
for
they
are
groaning
under
all
these
hopeless
burdens
without
having
sufficient
land
to
till
to
meet
their
demands
and
as
natural
means
fail
they
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
those
that
are
unnatural
hence
in
england
a
great
majority
of
the
inhabitants
are
made
slaves
of
virtually
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
greatest
part
of
the
world
and
are
forced
to
be
their
labourers
thousands
of
them
are
immured
in
immense
factories
little
less
than
prisons
groaning
under
a
wearisome
sickening
unhealthy
labour
deprived
of
free
wholesome
air
weak
and
emaciated
not
having
a
sufficiency
of
the
necessaries
of
life
thousands
more
from
morning
till
night
are
immured
in
pits
shut
out
from
the
light
of
day
the
carol
of
the
birds
and
the
beauty
of
nature
sickly
and
weak
in
many
instances
for
want
of
food
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
their
wretchedness
gloom
and
misery
you
will
sometimes
hear
them
trying
to
sing
in
their
dungeons
and
in
broken
dying
accents
britons
never
shall
be
slaves
i
will
here
give
as
one
example
an
iron
works
that
i
visited
lately
in
wales
one
of
the
proprietors
informed
me
that
they
employed
fifteen
thousand
persons
and
paid
them
per
week
most
of
these
people
laboured
under
ground
in
the
pits
digging
for
iron
ore
and
coal
the
remainder
were
employed
principally
about
the
furnaces
in
rolling
the
iron
at
heavy
laborious
fatiguing
work
and
who
were
they
toiling
for
principally
for
the
americans
and
russians
at
that
time
to
furnish
them
with
railroad
iron
and
what
did
they
get
for
their
labour
the
riches
of
those
countries
no
a
week
among
about
fifteen
thousand
persons
i
suppose
however
a
number
of
these
were
boys
and
girls
the
average
wages
of
men
was
from
ten
to
twelve
shillings
per
week
and
this
is
their
pay
for
that
labour
and
yet
the
masters
are
not
to
be
blamed
that
i
can
learn
for
they
are
forced
by
competition
to
this
state
of
things
and
by
the
unnatural
artificial
state
of
society
if
they
did
not
do
this
their
workmen
must
be
out
of
employ
and
ten
times
worse
off
if
that
were
possible
than
they
are
now
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
america
where
the
railroads
run
through
coal
and
iron
mines
both
they
leave
them
untouched
and
come
to
england
for
iron
to
make
the
rails
of
that
they
can
not
afford
to
make
at
home
because
of
higher
wages
and
an
to
society
which
prevents
them
from
being
coerced
into
bondage
if
the
world
was
right
the
labour
would
be
done
there
and
not
here
and
the
labour
of
carriage
saved
the
situation
of
the
peasantry
and
workmen
in
france
germany
prussia
austria
and
russia
and
in
fact
i
may
say
of
europe
generally
is
worse
even
than
that
of
the
same
class
in
england
and
wherever
we
turn
our
attention
we
see
nothing
but
poverty
distress
misery
and
confusion
for
if
men
do
not
copy
after
the
good
and
virtuous
they
generally
do
after
the
evil
when
nations
and
rulers
set
the
pattern
they
generally
find
plenty
to
follow
their
example
hence
covetousness
fraud
rapine
bloodshed
and
murder
prevail
to
an
alarming
extent
if
a
nation
is
covetous
an
individual
thinks
he
may
be
also
if
a
nation
commits
a
fraud
it
sanctions
his
acts
in
a
small
way
and
if
a
nation
engages
in
wholesale
robbery
an
individual
does
not
see
the
impropriety
of
doing
it
in
retail
if
a
strong
nation
oppresses
a

are

the

by

might
enter
into
a
detail
of
the
crimes
abominations
lusts
and
corruptions
that
exist
in
many
of
our
large
cities
but
i
shall
leave
this

and
conclude
with
the
remarks
of
the
prophet
isaiah
who
gazed
in
prophetic
vision
on
this
scene
behold
the
lord
maketh
the
earth
empty
and
maketh
it
waste
and
turneth
it
upside
down
and
scattereth
abroad
the
inhabitants
thereof
the
earth
also
is
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
because
they
have
transgressed
the
laws
changed
the
ordinances
and
broken
the
everlasting
covenant
therefore
hath
the
curse
devoured
the
earth
and
they
that
dwell
therein
are
desolate
isaiah
xxiv
and
iniquity
of
every
description
goes
hand
in
hand
vice
in
all
its
sickening
and
disgusting
forms
revels
in
the
palace
in
the
city
in
the
cottage
depravity
corruption
debauchery
and
abominations
abound
and
man
that
once
stood
proudly
erect
in
the
image
of
his
maker
pure
virtuous
holy
and
noble
is
vitiated
weak
immoral
and
degraded
and
the
earth
which
was
once
a
garden
not
only
brings
forth
briars
and
thorns
but
is
actually
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
those
great
national
evils
of
which
i
have
spoken
are
things
which
at
present
seem
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
human
agency
legislation
or
control
they
are
diseases
that
have
been
generating
for
centuries
that
have
entered
into
the
vitals
of
all
institutions
religious
and
political
that
have
prostrated
the
powers
and
energies
of
all
bodies
politic
and
left
the
world
to
groan
under
them
for
they
are
evils
that
exist
in
church
and
state
at
home
and
abroad
among
jew
and
gentile
christian
pagan
and
mahomedan
king
prince
courtier
and
peasant
like
the
deadly
simoon
they
have
paralyzed
the
energies
broken
the
spirits
damped
the
enterprize
corrupted
the
morals
and
crushed
the
hopes
of
the
world
thousands
of
men
would
desire
to
do
good
if
they
only
knew
how
but
they
see
not
the
foundation
and
extent
of
the
evil
and
opinions
customs
and
doctrines
blind
their
eyes
and
damp
their
energies
and
if
a
few
should
see
the
evil
and
try
a
remedy
what
are
a
few
in
opposition
to
the
views
power
influence
and
corruption
of
the
world
no
power
on
this
side
of
heaven
can
correct
the
evil
it
is
a
world
that
is
degenerated
and
it
requires
a

to
put
it
right
chapter
iii
on
the
incompetency
of
the
means
made
use
of
by
man
to
regenerate
the
world
i
purpose
in
this
chapter
to
shew
the
incompetency
of
the
means
made
use
of
by
man
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
purposes
of
god
the
establishment
of
his
kingdom
or
millennial
reign
now
if
it
is
the
kingdom
of
god
that
is
to
be
established
it
must
be
introduced
by
god
he
must
not
only
be
the
originator
of
it
but
the
controller
also
and
any
means
short
of
these
must
fail
of
the
object
designed
the
great
evils
that
now
exist
in
the
world
are
the
consequences
of
man
departure
from
god
this
has
introduced
this
degeneracy
and
imbecility
and
nothing
but
a
retracing
of
his
steps
and
a
return
to
god
can
bring
about
a
restitution
god
gave
to
man
a
moral
agency
as
head
of
the
world
under
himself
man
has
usurped
the
sole
authority
and
taken
upon
himself
to
reign
and
rule
without
god
the
natural
consequence
is
that
we
have
inherited
all
the
evils
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
nothing
but
the
wisdom
goodness
power
and
compassion
of
god
can
deliver
us
therefrom
restore
the
earth
to
its
pristine
excellence
and
put
man
again
in
possession
of
those
blessings
which
he
has
forfeited
by
his
transgression
emperors
kings
princes
potentates
statesmen
philosophers
and
churches
have
tried
for
ages
to
bring
this
state
of
things
about
but
they
have
all
signally
failed
not
having
derived
their
wisdom
from
the
proper
source
and
all
human
means
made
use
of
at
the
present
time
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
world
must
fail
as
all
human
means
have
always
done
there
are
some
who
suppose
that
the
influence
of
christianity
as
it
is
now
preached
and
administered
will
bring
about
a
millennial
reign
of
peace
we
will
briefly
examine
the
subject
first
we
will
take
the
greek
and
catholic
churches
as
they
have
existed
for
ages
without
an
examination
of
their
doctrines
whether
right
or
wrong
for
they
form
two
of
the
largest
branches
of
the
christian
church
they
have
more
or
less
governed
a
great
portion
of
europe
at
different
times
and
what
is
the
situation
of
the
people
and
nations
where
they
have
held
sway
we
have
noticed
the
effects
and
already
briefly
touched
upon
the
evils
that
prevail
in
those
countries
and
if
greece
and
russia
or
any
other
country
where
the
greek
church
has
held
sway
be
a
fair
specimen
of
the
influence
of
that
church
we
have
very
little
prospect
if
that
religion
were
more
widely
diffused
or
extended
that
the
results
would
be
more
beneficial
for
if
it
has
failed
in
a
few
nations
to
ameliorate
their
condition
it
would
necessarily
fail
to
benefit
the
earth
if
extended
over
it
nor
do
we
turn
with
any
better
prospect
to
the
catholic
religion
of
what
benefit
has
it
been
to
nations
where
it
has
prevailed
the
most
has
there
been
less
war
less
animosity
less
butchery
less
evil
of
any
kind
under
its
empire
it
can
not
be
said
that
it
has
been
crippled
in
its
progress
or
its
operations
it
has
held
full
sway
in
spain
rome
and
a
great
portion
of
italy
in
france
and
mexico
for
generations
not
to
mention
many
smaller
states
has
it
augmented
the
happiness
of
those
nations
of
the
world
i
need
not
here
refer
to
the
history
of
the
waldenses
and
albigenses
and
huguenots
to
that
of
the
crusades
wherein
so
many
christian
kings
engaged
nor
to
the
unhappy
differences
the
wars
and
commotions
the
bloodshed
and
carnage
that
have
existed
among
these
people
for
their
history
is
well
known
and
the
present
position
of
both
the
greek
and
roman
churches
presents
a
spectacle
that
is
anything
but
encouraging
to
lead
us
to
hope
that
if
the
world
were
under
their
influence
a
millennial
reign
of
peace
and
righteousness
would
ensue
and
let
not
any
one
say
that
these
churches
have
not
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
develop
themselves
for
their
religion
prevailed
and
was
cherished
in
those
nations
they
have
held
universal
sway
at
different
times
for
generations
the
kings
councils
and
legislatures
have
been
catholic
or
greek
in
rome
the
pope
has
ruled
supreme
and
also
for
some
time
in
lombardy
ravenna
and
other
states
in
greece
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
and
in
russia
the
emperor
is
head
of
the
church
but
methinks
i
hear
the
protestants
say
we
fully
accord
with
you
thus
far
but
we
have
placed
christianity
on
another
footing
let
us
examine
this
subject
for
a
moment
the
question
would
naturally
follow
what
have
the
reformations
of
calvin
luther
and
other
reformers
done
for
the
world
we
may
notice
that
denmark
sweden
prussia
with
a
great
part
of
germany
holland
and
switzerland
as
also
england
and
the
united
states
are
protestant
what
can
we
say
of
them
that
they
are
a
part
of
the
disorganized
world
and
have
manifested
the
same
unhappy
dispositions
as
other
portions
reform
has
not
altered
their
dispositions
or
circumstances
we
see
among
them
the
same
ambitious
grasping
reckless
disposition
manifested
and
consequently
the
same
wars
bloodshed
poverty
misery
and
distress
and
millions
of
human
beings
have
been
sacrificed
to
their
pride
ambition
and
avarice
and
thirst
for
national
fame
and
glory
the
reformation
of
the
church
of
england
is
anything
but
creditable
to
that
church
i
refer
to
henry
and
the
vacillating
course
taken
by
some
of
its
early
reformers
and
its
persecution
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
it
in
religious
faith
i
might
here
refer
to
the
religious
intolerance
of
calvin
of
geneva
and
knox
of
scotland
and
other
reformers
but
as
these
are
mere
individual
affairs
i
pass
over
them
if
we
look
at
christian
nations
as
a
whole
we
see
a
picture
that
is
truly
lamentable
a
miserable
portrait
of
poor
degenerated
fallen
humanity
we
see
christian
nations
arrayed
against
christian
nations
in
battle
with
the
christian
ministers
of
each
christian
nation
calling
upon
the
christian
god
to
give
them
each
the
victory
over
their
enemies
christians
and
worshippers
of
the
same
god
hence
christian
england
has
been
arrayed
against
christian
france
christian
russia
against
christian
prussia
christian
spain
against
christian
holland
christian
austria
against
christian
hungary
christian
england
against
christian
united
states
and
christian
united
states
against
christian
mexico
not
to
mention
the
innumerable
aggressions
and
conquests
of
some
of
the
larger
nations
not
only
upon
their
christian
brethren
but
against
other
nations
of
the
earth
before
those
several
nations
have
engaged
in
their
wars
their
ministers
have
presented
their
several
prayers
before
the
same
god
and
if
he
had
been
as
infatuated
as
they
and
listened
to
their
prayers
they
would
long
ago
have
been
destroyed
and
the
christian
world
depopulated
after
their
prayers
they
have
met
in
deadly
strife
foe
has
rushed
against
foe
with
mortal
energy
and
the
clarion
of
war
the
clang
of
arms
and
the
cannon
roar
have
been
followed
by
dying
groans
shattered
limbs
carnage
blood
and
death
and
unutterable
misery
and
distress
desolate
hearths
lonely
widows
and
fatherless
children
and
yet
these
are
all
christian
nations
christian
brethren
worshippers
of
the
same
god
christianity
has
prevailed
more
or
less
for
eighteen
hundred
years
if
it
should
still
continue
and
overspread
the
world
in
its
present
form
what
would
it
accomplish
the
redemption
and
regeneration
no
verily
its
most
staunch
supporters
and
most
strenuous
advocates
would
say
for
like
causes
always
produce
like
effects
and
if
it
has
failed
to
regenerate
the
nations
where
it
has
had
full
sway
for
generations
it
must
necessarily
fail
to
regenerate
the
world
if
it
has
failed
in
a
small
thing
how
can
it
accomplish
a
large
one
there
are
some
of
the
evangelical
churches
and
modern
reformers
who
will
tell
me
that
the
above
is
not
christianity
only
a
form
not
the
spirit
and
life
but
it
is
national
christianity
and
it
is
the
nations
the
world
and
its
redemption
that
we
are
speaking
of
but
lest
they
should
think
me
unfair
in
making
this
application
i
will
briefly
examine
their
position
which
of
the
sects
or
parties
is
it
that
is
good
evangelical
and
pure
the
church
of
england
methodists
presbyterians
independents
baptists
universalists
or
which
of
the
hundreds
of
sects
that
flood
christendom
for
they
do
not
agree
there
exists
as
much
unhappy
difference
among
them
as
there
does
among
the
nations
they
have
not
power
of
course
to
act
nationally
but
as
individual
sects
there
is
as
much
virulence
discord
division
and
strife
among
them
as
among
any
other
people
there
is
sect
against
sect
party
against
party
polemical
essay
against
polemical
essay
discussion
after
discussion
and
hard
words
bitter
feelings
angry
disputes
wrangling
hatred
and
malice
prevail
to
an
alarming
extent
and
it
is
enough
in
many
instances
for
a
member
even
of
a
family
to
be
of
a
different
religious
persuasion
no
matter
how
honest
to
cause
his
expulsion
from
the
family
in
fact
if
we
look
at
christianity
as
exhibited
among
the
evangelical
societies
of
england
and
the
united
states
where
protestantism
bears
rule
unchecked
what
do
we
see
nothing
but
a
game
at
hazard
where
a
thousand
opinions
distract
the
people
each
clamoring
for
his
own
peculiar
form
of
worship
and
like
the
athenians
clinging
with
tenacity
to
their
own
favorite
god
no
matter
how
absurd
or
ridiculous
his
pretensions
i
would
remark
however
both
to
catholic
and
protestant
that
there
is
much
good
associated
with
both
their
systems
in
the
teaching
of
morality
virtue
faith
in
god
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
there
are
thousands
of
sincere
honest
good
and
virtuous
people
among
them
as
also
among
the
nations
that
these
evils
have
been
the
growth
of
ages
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
and
the
children
teeth
have
been
set
on
edge
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
say
anything
of
missionary
societies
tract
societies
and
evangelical
societies
for
if
the
fountain
is
impure
the
stream
must
be
impure
if
the
tree
is
bad
the
fruit
will
be
bad
also
it
is
certainly
a
praiseworthy
object
to
spread
the
bible
and
all
useful
information
and
to
do
good
as
far
as
we
can
but
to
talk
of
this
evangelizing
the
world
is
folly
we
will
now
turn
our
attention
for
a
short
time
to
another
society
which
has
been
formed
lately
in
europe
called
a
peace
society
and
which
has
lately
held
several
congresses
in
london
berlin
and
elsewhere
with
representatives
from
many
of
the
european
nations
and
the
united
states
their
object
is
to
ameliorate
the
condition
of
the
world
and
bring
about
universal
peace
but
with
all
deference
to
their
feelings
and
fervent
desires
that
such
a
happy
event
might
be
consummated
i
must
beg
leave
to
differ
from
them
in
their
views
peace
is
a
desirable
thing
it
is
the
gift
of
god
and
the
greatest
gift
that
god
can
bestow
upon
mortals
what
is
more
desirable
than
peace
peace
in
nations
peace
in
cities
peace
in
families
like
the
soft
murmuring
zephyr
its
soothing
influence
calms
the
brow
of
care
dries
the
eye
of
sorrow
and
chases
trouble
from
the
bosom
and
let
it
be
universally
experienced
and
it
would
drive
sorrow
from
the
world
and
make
this
earth
a
paradise
but
peace
is
the
gift
of
god
jesus
said
to
his
disciples
peace
i
leave
with
you
my
peace
i
give
unto
you
not
as
the
world
giveth
give
i
unto
you
john

moral
suasion
is
always
good
and
the
most
happy
that
man
can
employ
but
without
the
interposition
of
god
it
will
be
useless
the
nations
of
the
world
have
corrupted
themselves
before
god
and
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
be
governed
by
those
principles
without
regeneration
if
they
were
pure
and
living
in
the
fear
of
god
it
would
be
another
thing
but
the
world
at
the
present
time
is
not
made
of
the
proper
materials
to
submit
to
a
congressional
interposition
of
a
kind
similar
to
the
one
now
established
the
materials
will
not
combine
and
no
power
short
of
the
power
of
god
can
accomplish
it
we
have
got
into
the
feet
and
toes
of
daniel
national
image
they
are
composed
of
iron
and
clay
which
will
not
mix
there
is
no
chemical
affinity
between
the
bodies
as
it
has
been
in
generations
past
the
strong
nations
feel
independent
and
capable
of
taking
care
of
their
own
affairs
and
if
the
weak
unite
it
is
to
protect
themselves
against
the
strong
the
principles
of
aggression
and
protection
still
rule
as
strong
in
the
human
bosom
as
ever
they
did
the
world
is
as
belligerent
now
as
it
ever
was
and
as
full
of
commotion
and
uncertainty
the
dispositions
of
the
nations
of
kings
rulers
and
people
are
the
same
the
late
revolutions
in
europe
and
present
uncertain
state
of
political
affairs
are
an
evident
proof
of
this
the
political
atmosphere
of
the
european
nations
is
full
of
combustion
and
only
needs
igniting
to
set
the
whole
in
one
common
blaze
talk
of

there
is
war
in

cabals
and
parties
that
now
distract
the
world
it
is
whispered
in
the
midnight
caucus
and
proclaimed
in
open
day
the
same
spirit
enters
into
the
social
circle
and
breaks
up
families
father
is
arrayed
against

and

against

against

and

against

and

against

it
presides
triumphant
at
the
assemblies
of
the
peace
society
and
spreads
confusion
discord
and
division
there
a
moral
deadly
evil
has
infused
itself
throughout
the
world
and
it
needs
a
more
powerful
restorative
than
the
one
proposed
to
ameliorate
its
condition
if
the
root
of
the
evil
be
not
eradicated
in
vain
we
regulate
the
branches
if
the
fountain
be
impure
in
vain
we
strive
to
purify
the
streams
the
means
used
are
not
adequate
to
the
end
designed
and
in
spite
of
all
those
weak
puny
efforts
the
world
will
continue
in
its
present
sickly
state
unless
a
more
powerful
antidote
be
applied
another
principle
has
many
advocates
on
the
continent
of
europe
at
the
present
time
a
principle
of
socialism
like
everything
else
it
is
possessed
of
different
phases
and
has
been
advocated
in
its
various
branches
by
fourier
robert
owen
cabet
pierre
leroux
and
proudhon
in
europe
and
fanny
wright
in
america
the
leading
object
of
many
of
these
people
is
to
have
a
community
of
goods
and
property
some
of
them
discard
christianity
altogether
and
others
leave
every
one
to
do
as
they
please
others
attach
a
little
importance
to
it
i
would
briefly
remark
on
the
first
of
those
that
if
scepticism
is
to
be
the
basis
of
the
happiness
of
man
we
shall
be
in
a
poor
situation
to
improve
the
world
it
is
practical
infidelity
that
has
placed
the
world
in
its
present
position
how
far
the
unblushing
profession
of
it
will
lead
to
restoration
and
happiness
i
must
leave
my
readers
to
judge
it
is
our
departure
from
god
that
has
brought
upon
us
all
our
misery
it
is
not
a
very
reasonable
way
to
alleviate
it
by
confirming
mankind
in
scepticism
i
am
aware
that
there
is
much
in
the
world
to
induce
doubt
and
uncertainty
on
religious
affairs
and
religious
professors
have
much
to
answer
for
but
there
is
a
very
material
difference
between
the
religion
of
god
and
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
that
of
those
who
profess
his
name
as
regards
communism
in
the
abstract
or
on
the
voluntary
principle
we
will
examine
that
briefly
pick
out
a
number
of
men
in
paris
london
berlin
or
any
other
city
associated
with
all
the
evils
and
corruptions
of
those
cities
and
organize
them
into
a
community
will
the
mere
removal
of
them
from
one
place
to
another
make
them
better
certainly
not
if
they
were
corrupt
before
they
will
be
after
their
removal
and
if
they
were
unhappy
before
they
will
be
after
this
temporary
change
will
not
make
a
difference
for
men
in
possession
of
different
religious
and
political
and
moral
views
never
can
be
united
in
harmony
the
difficulties
that
exist
in
the
world
on
a
large
scale
would
exist
there
in
miniature
and
though
prudence
forbearance
and
policy
in
smaller
circles
might
operate
for
a
time
the
evils
would
still
exist
and
though
they
might
smoulder
and
be
pent
up
like
a
volcano
they
would
only
rage
with
greater
fury
when
they
did
burst
out
i
have
conversed
with
some
who
seem
to
think
that
all
that
is
necessary
to
promote
the
happiness
of
man
is
that
he
have
sufficient
to
eat
and
drink
and
that
through
this
means
it
would
be
obtained
i
grant
that
the
comforts
and
happiness
of
men
are
in
a
great
measure
augmented
by
these
things
but
to
place
them
as
the
root
and
foundation
is
wrong
in
the
present
situation
of
europe
where
so
much
squalid
poverty
wretchedness
and
distress
abound
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
such
feelings
should
obtain
but
if
we
cast
our
eyes
abroad
in
the
world
we
shall
find
that
unhappiness
is
not
always
associated
with
the
poor
it
revels
in
the
church
and
state
among
kings
potentates
princes
and
rulers
it
follows
the
haunts
of
the
libertine
and
profligate
and
gnaws
in
many
instances
the
conscience
of
the
minister
it
rides
with
lords
and
ladies
in
their
carriages
and
chariots
and
revels
in
splendid
saloons
and
in
banquet
halls
many
a
pleasant
countenance
covers
an
aching
heart
and
many
a
gorgeous
costume
hides
the
deadly
worm
jealousy
disappointed
ambition
blasted
hopes
cold
neglect
and
conjugal
infidelity
produce
many
a
miserable
heart
and
rage
envy
malice
and
murder
lurk
in
many
instances
under
the
cover
of
pomp
splendor
competency
or
magnificence
not
to
mention
the
care
anxiety
and
trouble
of
officers
of
state
in
these
troublous
times
if
the
poor
knew
the
situation
of
many
of
those
in
different
circumstances
they
would
not
envy
their
situations
again
if
we
notice
the
position
of
some
of
the
southern
and
western
states
of
america
they
have
abundance
to
eat
and
to
drink
their
lands
bring
forth
bountifully
but
does
this
make
them
happy
verily
no
the
same
false
state
of
society
exists
there
men
are
awfully
under
the
influence
of
their
depraved
passions
men
are
frequently
put
to
death
by
what
is
called
lynch
law
without
judge
or
jury
the
pistol
the
bowie
knife
the
rifle
and
the
dirk
are
in
frequent
requisition
and
misery
and
unhappiness
prevail
in
mexico
where
they
possess
one
of
the
richest
countries
in
the
world
a
salubrious
climate
a
rich
soil
abounding
also
with
the
most
valuable
mineral
resources
yet
the
people
are
unhappy
guerillas
plunder
the
traveller
their
streets
are
crowded
with
beggars
its
men
are
without
courage
or
energy
and
the
country
is
left
a
prey
to
any
nation
who
has
covetousness
or
power
to
oppress
it
the
scriptures
say
that
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
from
the
mouth
of
god
and
as
they
do
not
exist
in
this
way
another
scripture
tells
the
story
in
plain
terms
for
it
says
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish
proverbs
xxix
there
is
also
another
political
party
who
desire
through
the
influence
of
legislation
and
coercion
to
level
the
world
to
say
the
least
it
is
a
species
of
robbery
to
some
it
may
appear
an
honorable
one
but
nevertheless
it
is
robbery
what
right
has
any
private
man
to
take
by
force
the
property
of
another
the
laws
of
all
nations
would
punish
such
a
man
as
a
thief
would
thousands
of
men
engaged
in
the
same
business
make
it
more
honorable
certainly
not
and
if
a
nation
were
to
do
it
would
a
nation
act
sanctify
a
wrong
deed
no
the
algerine
pirates
or
arabian
hordes
were
never
considered
honorable
on
account
of
their
numbers
and
a
nation
or
nations
engaging
in
this
would
only
augment
the
banditti
but
could
never
sanctify
the
deed
i
shall
not
here
enter
into
the
various
manners
of
obtaining
wealth
but
would
merely
state
that
any
unjust
acquisition
of
it
ought
to
be
punished
by
law
wealth
is
generally
the
representation
of
labour
industry
and
talent
if
one
man
is
industrious
enterprising
diligent
careful
and
saves
property
and
his
children
follow
in
his
steps
and
accumulate
wealth
and
another
man
is
careless
prodigal
and
lazy
and
his
children
inherit
his
poverty
i
can
not
conceive
upon
what
principles
of
justice
the
children
of
the
idle
and
profligate
have
a
right
to
put
their
hands
into
the
pockets
of
those
who
are
diligent
and
careful
and
rob
them
of
their
purse
let
this
principle
exist
and
all
energy
and
enterprise
would
be
crushed
men
would
be
afraid
of
again
accumulating
lest
they
should
again
be
robbed
industry
and
talent
would
have
no
stimulant
and
confusion
and
ruin
would
inevitably
follow
again
if
you
took
men
property
without
their
consent
the
natural
consequence
would
be
that
they
would
seek
to
retake
it
the
first
opportunity
and
this
state
of
things
would
only
deluge
the
world
in
blood
so
that
let
any
of
these
measures
be
carried
out
even
according
to
the
most
sanguine
hopes
of
the
parties
they
would
not
only
bring
distress
upon
others
but
also
upon
themselves
certainly
they
would
not
bring
about
the
peace
of
the
world
one
thing
more
upon
this
subject
and
i
have
done
in
europe
there
has
been
of
late
years
a
great
mania
for
revolutions
a
strong
desire
to
establish
republican
governments
but
let
me
remark
here
that
the
form
of
government
will
not
materially
affect
the
position
of
the
people
nor
add
to
the
resources
of
a
country
if
a
country
is
rich
and
prosperous
under
a
monarchy
it
will
be
so
under
a
republic
and
if
poor
under
one
it
will
be
under
another
if
nations
think
proper
to
change
their
form
of
government
they
of
course
have
a
right
to
do
so
but
to
think
that
this
will
ameliorate
their
condition
and
produce
happiness
is
altogether
a
mistake
happiness
and
peace
are
the
gifts
of
god
and
come
from
him
every
kind
of
government
has
its
good
and
evil
properties
rome
was
unhappy
under
a
kingly
government
and
also
under
a
republican
form
carthage
as
a
republic
was
no
more
happy
than
many
of
its
monarchial
contemporaries
nor
was
corinth
holland
or
venice
and
republican
genoa
has
not
manifested
anything
very
much
in
favor
of
these
principles
france
was
unhappy
under
her
emperor
she
was
unhappy
under
her
kings
and
is
unhappy
as
a
republic
america
is
perhaps
some
little
exception
to
this
but
the
difference
lies
not
so
much
in
her
government
as
in
the
extent
of
her
country
the
richness
of
her
soil
and
abundance
of
her
resources
for
as
i
have
already
mentioned
lynch
law
prevails
to
an
alarming
extent
in
the
south
and
west
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
east
there
are
mobs
painted
as
indians
resisting
the
officers
of
the
law
and
doing
it
with
impunity
and
it
is
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
persons
having
paid
for
property
shall
own
it
or
be
dispossessed
by
their
tenants
not
in
law
for
the
constitution
and
laws
are
good
but
in
practice
defective
through
popular
clamor
and
violence
i
refer
to
the
estates
of
van
ranseller
and
others
and
in
the
west
to
joseph
and
hyrum
smith
who
were
murdered
in
carthage
jail
without
any
redress
although
their
murderers
were
known
to
the
officers
of
state
and
to
the
inhabitants
of
a
city
ten
thousand
in
number
together
with
twenty
thousand
others
principally
farmers
labourers
and
mechanics
occupying
a
country
about
ten
miles
wide
and
thirty
long
most
of
which
was
well
cultivated
and
owned
by
the
occupants
who
were
all
forced
by
continual
harassing
by
lawless
mobs
to
leave
a
country
in
which
they
could
not
be
protected
and
seek
an
asylum
in
a
far
off
desert
home
there
being
no
power
in
the
government
to
give
redress
it
is
altogether
an
infatuation
to
think
that
a
change
in
government
will
mend
the
circumstances
or
increase
the
resources
when
the
whole
world
is
groaning
under
corruption
if
there
are
twenty
men
who
have
twenty
pounds
of
bread
to
divide
amongst
them
it
matters
but
little
whether
it
is
divided
by
three
ten
or
the
whole
it
will
not
increase
the
amount
i
grant
however
that
there
are
flagrant
abuses
of
which
we
have
mentioned
some
associated
with
all
kinds
of
governments
and
many
things
to
be
complained
of
justly
but
they
arise
from
the
wickedness
of
man
and
the
corrupt
and
artificial
state
of
society
do
away
with
one
set
of
rulers
and
you
have
only
the
same
materials
to
make
another
of
and
if
ever
so
honestly
disposed
they
are
surrounded
with
such
a
train
of
circumstances
over
which
they
have
no
control
that
they
can
not
mend
them
there
is
frequently
much
excitement
on
this
subject
and
many
people
ignorant
of
these
things
are
led
to
suppose
that
their
resources
will
be
increased
and
their
circumstances
bettered
but
when
they
find
after
much
contention
struggling
and
bloodshed
that
it
does
not
rain
bread
cheese
and
clothing
that
it
is
only
a
change
of
men
papers
and
parchment
chagrin
and
disappointment
naturally
follow
there
is
much
that
is
good
and
much
that
is
bad
in
all
governments
and
i
am
not
seeking
here
to
portray
a
perfect
government
but
to
show
some
of
the
evils
associated
with
them
and
the
utter
incompetency
of
all
the
plans
of
men
to
restore
a
perfect
government
and
as
all
their
plans
have
failed
so
they
will
fail
for
it
is
the
work
of
god
and
not
of
man
the
moral
agency
of
man
without
god
has
had
its
full
development
his
weakness
wickedness
and
corruption
have
placed
the
world
where
it
is
he
can
see
as
in
a
glass
his
incompetency
and
folly
and
nothing
but
the
power
of
god
can
restore
it
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
those
various
plans
should
exist
for
the
world
is
in
a
horrible
situation
jesus
prophesied
of
it
and
said
there
should
be
upon
the
earth
distress
of
nations
perplexity
hearts
failing
them
for
fear
and
for
looking
after
those
things
which
are
coming
upon
the
earth
luke
xxi
men
see
these
things
and
their
hearts
fear
confusion
disorder
misery
blood
and
ruin
seem
to
stare
them
in
the
face
and
in
the
absence
of
something
great
noble
and
magnificent
suited
to
the
exigency
of
the
case
they
try
the
foregoing
remedies
as
a
sailor
in
the
absence
of
a
boat
would
cling
with
tenacity
to
any
floating
piece
of
wreck
to
save
him
from
a
watery
grave
neither
can
men
be
blamed
for
trying
to
do
good
it
is
certainly
a
laudable
object
and
with
all
the
selfishness
ambition
and
pride
associated
with
the
foregoing
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
much
uprightness
sincerity
and
honest
zeal
there
are
very
many
philanthropists
who
would
gladly
ameliorate
the
condition
of
men
and
of
the
world
if
they
knew
how
but
the
means
employed
are
not
commensurate
with
the
end
every
grade
of
society
is
vitiated
and
corrupt
the
whole
head
is
sick
and
the
whole
heart
faint
our
systems
our
policy
our
legislation
our
education
and
philosophy
are
all
wrong
neither
can
we
be
particularly
blamed
for
these
evils
have
been
the
growth
of
ages
our
fathers
have
left
god
his
guidance
control
and
support
and
we
have
been
left
to
ourselves
and
our
present
position
is
a
manifest
proof
of
our
incompetency
to
govern
and
our
past
failures
make
it
evident
that
any
future
effort
with
the
same
means
would
be
as
useless
the
world
is
diseased
and
it
requires
a
world
remedy
chapter
iv
what
is
man
what
is
his
destiny
and
relationship
to
god
having
shewn
in
the
foregoing
chapters
that
the
rule
of
god
is
perfect
where
he
governs
alone
that
the
rule
of
man
is
imperfect
and
has
introduced
confusion
and
misery
and
that
the
plans
of
men
are
not
competent
to
restore
the
world
to
happiness
and
the
fulfilment
of
the
object
for
which
it
was
created
it
now
devolves
upon
us
to
investigate
the
way
that
this
thing
can
and
will
be
accomplished
for
there
is
a
time
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
when
there
will
be
a
reign
of
righteousness
first
then
we
will
enquire
who
and
what
is
man
and
what
is
his
destiny
and
what
his
relationship
to
god
for
before
we
can
define
government
correctly
it
will
be
necessary
to
find
out
the
nature
of
the
being
that
has
to
be
governed
what
then
is
man
is
he
a
being
temporal
and
earthly
alone
and
when
he
dies
does
he
sink
into
forgetfulness
is
he
annihilated
or
has
he
a
spirit
as
well
as
a
body
if
the
first
be
the
case
he
alone
has
a
right
to
regulate
his
own
affairs
to
frame
his
own
government
and
to
pursue
that
course
which
to
him
seems
good
if
not
the
case
is
different
i
do
not
here
wish
to
enter
into
a
philosophical
disquisition
on
the
subject
but
as
i
am
writing
at
present
to
believers
in
the
bible
i
shall
confine
myself
more
to
that
i
will
state
that
man
is
an
eternal
being
composed
of
body
and
spirit
his
spirit
existed
before
he
came
here
his
body
exists
with
the
spirit
in
time
and
after
death
the
spirit
exists
without
the
body
in
the
resurrection
both
body
and
spirit
will
finally
be
reunited
and
it
requires
both
body
and
spirit
to
make
a
perfect
man
whether
in
time
or
eternity
i
know
there
are
those
who
suppose
that
the
spirit
of
man
comes
into
existence
with
his
body
and
that
intelligence
and
spirit
are
organized
with
the
body
but
we
read
that
when
god
made
man
he
made
him
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
he
made
him
in
his
own
likeness
man
was
then
a
lifeless
body
he
afterwards
breathed
into
him
the
breath
of
life
and
man
became
a
living
soul
before
that
spirit
was
given
he
was
dead
lifeless
and
when
that
spirit
is
taken
away
he
is
again
lifeless
and
let
not
any
one
say
that
the
body
is
perfect
without
the
spirit
for
the
moment
the
spirit
leaves
the
body
no
matter
how
perfect
its
organization
may
be
the
man
is
inanimate
and
destitute
of
intelligence
and
feeling
it
is
the
spirit
that
gives
life
hence
we
find
that
when
jarius
daughter
was
dead
his
servant
came
and
told
him
saying
thy
daughter
is
dead
trouble
not
the
master
but
when
she
was
restored
it
is
said
her
spirit
and
she
arose
straightway
luke
viii
when
her
spirit
was
absent
the
body
was
dead
when
it
returned
the
body
lived
moses
spake
unto
the
lord
and
said
let
the
lord
the
god
of
spirits
of
all
set
a
man
over
the
congregation
num
xxvii
again
the
lord
in
speaking
to
jeremiah
said
before
i
formed
thee
in
the
belly
i
knew
thee
i
i
would
ask
what
part
of
jeremiah
did
he
know
it
could
not
be
his
body
for
it
was
not
in
existence
but
he
knew
his
spirit
for
he
was
the
father
of
his
spirit
the
lord
speaks
to
job
and
says
where
wast
thou
when
i
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
declare
if
thou
hast
understanding
who
hath
laid
the
measures
thereof
if
thou
knowest
or
who
hath
stretched
the
line
upon
it
whereupon
are
the
foundations
thereof
fastened
or
who
laid
the
corner
stone
thereof
when
the
morning
stars
sung
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
xxxviii
again
john
says
they
that
dwell
on
the
earth
shall
wonder
whose
names
were
not
written
in
the
book
of
life
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
rev
xvii
this
spirit
proceeds
forth
from
god
and
is
eternal
hence
solomon
says
in
speaking
of
death
then
shall
the
dust
return
to
the
earth
as
it
was
and
the
spirit
unto
god
who
gave
it
eccles
xii
that
the
spirit
is
eternal
is
very
evident
from
the
scriptures
jesus
prayed
to
his
father
and
said
o
father
glorify
thou
me
with
thine
own
self
with
the
glory
which
i
had
with
thee
the
world
john
xvii
here
jesus
speaks
of
an
existence
before
he
came
here
of
a
glory
he
had
with
his
father
before
the
world
was
christ
then
existed
before
he
came
here
and
took
a
body
again
jesus
says
i
have
manifested
thy
name
unto
the
men
which
thou
gavest
me
out
of
the
world
thine
they
were
and
thou
gavest
them
me
john
xvii
let
us
see
what
the
apostle
paul
says
on
the
subject
blessed
be
the
god
and
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
hath
blessed
us
with
all
spiritual
blessings
in
heavenly
places
in
christ
according
as
he
hath
chosen
us
in
him
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
ephes
i
christ
then
existed
with
his
father
before
the
world
was
and
the
saints
existed
in
or
with
him
what
part
their
bodies
no
their
spirits
again
man
exists
after
he
leaves
here
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
anything
about
the
life
of
the
spirit
after
the
death
of
the
body
or
of
the
resurrection
as
the
subjects
are
so
generally
known
and
believed
paul
says
if
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
christ
we
are
of
all
men
most
miserable
but
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
dead
and
become
the
first
fruits
of
them
that
slept
for
since
by
man
came
death
by
man
came
also
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
the
trumpet
shall
sound
and
the
dead
shall
be
raised
incorruptible
and
we
shall
be
changed
for
this
corruptible
must
put
on
incorruption
and
this
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
the
saying
that
is
written
death
is
swallowed
up
in
victory
cor
xv
if
man
then
is
an
eternal
being
came
from
god
exists
here
for
a
short
time
and
will
return
it
is
necessary
that
he
know
something
about
god
and
his
government
for
he
has
to
do
with
him
not
only
in
time
but
in
eternity
and
whatever
man
may
be
disposed
to
do
or
however
he
may
vaunt
himself
of
his
own
abilities
there
are
some
things
he
has
no
control
over
he
came
into
the
world
without
his
agency
he
will
have
to
leave
it
whether
he
desires
it
or
not
and
he
will
also
have
to
appear
in
another
world
he
is
destined
if
he
improves
his
opportunities
to
higher
and
greater
blessings
and
glory
than
are
associated
with
this
earth
in
its
present
state
and
hence
the
necessity
of
the
guidance
of
a
superior
power
and
intelligence
that
he
may
not
act
the
part
of
a
fool
here
and
jeopardize
his
eternal
interests
but
that
his
intelligence
may
be
commensurate
with
his
position
that
his
actions
here
may
have
a
bearing
upon
his
future
destiny
that
he
may
not
sink
into
the
slough
of
iniquity
and
degradation
and
contaminate
himself
with
corruption
that
he
may
stand
pure
virtuous
intelligent
and
honourable
as
a
son
of
god
and
seek
for
and
be
guided
and
governed
by
his
father
counsels
having
said
so
much
on
this
subject
we
will
continue
our
investigation
still
further
and
enquire
next
what
is
our
relationship
to
god
in
answering
this
i
would
briefly
remark
that
the
position
that
we
stand
in
to
him
is
that
of
a
son
adam
is
the
father
of
our
bodies
and
god
is
the
father
of
our
spirits
i
know
that
some
are
in
the
habit
of
looking
upon
god
as
a
monster
only
to
be
dreaded
known
only
in
the
earthquake
the
tempest
the
thunder
and
the
storm
and
that
there
is
something
gloomy
and
dismal
attached
to
his
service
if
there
is
it
is
the
appendage
of
man
and
not
of
god
is
there
anything
gloomy
in
the
works
that
god
has
made
turn
where
we
will
we
see
harmony
loveliness
cheerfulness
and
beauty
the
blessings
of
providence
were
made
for
man
and
his
enjoyment
he
is
placed
as
head
of
creation
for
him
the
earth
teems
with
the
richest
profusion
the
golden
grain
the
luscious
fruit
the
choicest
vines
for
him
the
herbs
and
flowers
bedeck
the
earth
shed
their
odoriferous
perfumes
and
display
their
gorgeous
beauty
for
him
the
proud
horse
yields
his
back
the
cow
gives
her
milk
and
the
bee
its
honey
for
him
the
sheep
yields
its
fleece
the
its
down
and
the
worm
its
silk
for
him
the
shrub
and
vine
bloom
and
blossom
and
nature
clothes
herself
in
her
richest
attire
the
rippling
stream
the
pure
fountain
the
crystal
river
flow
for
him
all
nature
spreads
her
richest
charms
and
invites
him
to
partake
of
her
joyousness
beauty
and
innocence
and
to
worship
her
god
talk
about
melancholy
in
the
fear
of
god
and
in
his
service
it
is
the
corruption
of
the
world
that
has
made
men
unhappy
and
the
corruption
of
religion
that
has
made
it
gloomy
these
are
the
miseries
entailed
by
men
not
the
blessings
of
god
talk
about
gloom
is
there
gloom
in
the
warbling
of
the
birds
in
the
prancing
of
the
horse
in
the
playfulness
of
the
lamb
or
kid
in
the
beauty
of
flowers
in
any
of
nature
gifts
or
rich
attire
or
in
god
that
made
them
or
in
his
service
there
are
others
again
who
would
place
the
lord
at
an
immense
distance
and
render
our
approach
to
him
almost
impossible
but
this
is
a
superstitious
idea
for
our
father
listens
to
the
cries
of
his
children
numbers
the
hairs
of
their
heads
and
the
scriptures
say
a
sparrow
can
not
fall
to
the
ground
without
his
notice
he
speaks
to
his
elect
and
says
he
that
toucheth
you
toucheth
the
apple
of
his
eye
zech
ii
he
is
our
father
and
hence
the
scriptures
tell
us
to
pray
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
paul
says
we
have
had
fathers
of
our
flesh
which
corrected
us
and
we
gave
them
reverence
shall
we
not
much
rather
be
in
subjection
unto
the
father
of
spirits
and
live
heb
xii
we
have
then
both
a
temporal
and
a
spiritual
father
and
hence
his
solicitude
for
our
welfare
and
his
desire
for
our
happiness
says
jesus
if
a
son
ask
bread
will
he
for
bread
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
if
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
to
them
that
ask
him
what
a
delightful
reflection
for
his
servants
to
draw
nigh
to
their
father
as
to
an
endearing
parent
and
ask
for
blessings
as
a
son
would
ask
for
bread
and
be
confident
of
receiving
hence
the
faithful
in
the
apostles
days
received
a
spirit
whereby
they
could
say
abba
father
or
father
father
what
an
endearing
relationship
and
if
the
world
could
comprehend
how
gladly
would
they
throw
themselves
upon
his
guardianship
seek
his
wisdom
and
government
and
claim
a
benediction
but
satan
has
blinded
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
they
know
not
the
things
which
make
for
their
peace
chapter
the
object
of
man
existence
on
the
earth
and
his
relationship
thereto
we
next
enquire
what
is
the
object
and
design
of
man
existence
on
the
earth
and
what
is
his
relationship
thereto
for
all
this
magnificent
world
with
its
creation
life
beauty
symmetry
order
and
grandeur
could
not
be
without
design
and
as
god
existed
before
man
there
must
have
been
some
object
in
man
creation
and
in
his
appearance
on
the
earth
as
i
have
before
stated
man
existed
before
he
came
here
in
a
spiritual
substance
but
had
not
a
body
when
i
speak
of
a
body
i
mean
an
earthly
one
for
i
consider
the
spirit
is
substance
but
more
elastic
subtle
and
refined
than
the
fleshy
body
that
in
the
union
of
the
spirit
and
flesh
there
is
more
perfection
than
in
the
spirit
alone
the
body
is
not
perfect
without
the
spirit
nor
the
spirit
without
the
body
it
takes
the
two
to
make
a
perfect
man
for
the
spirit
requires
a
tabernacle
to
give
it
power
to
develop
itself
and
to
exalt
it
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
both
in
time
and
eternity
one
of
the
greatest
curses
inflicted
on
satan
and
his
followers
when
they
were
cast
out
of
heaven
was
that
they
should
have
no
body
hence
when
he
appeared
before
the
lord
and
was
asked
from
whence
he
came
he
answered
from
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
from
walking
up
and
down
in
it
job
i
and
ii
for
this
reason
he
is
denominated
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
the
spirit
that
now
worketh
in
the
children
of
disobedience
ephes
ii
hence
he
exerts
an
invisible
agency
over
the
spirits
of
men
darkens
their
minds
and
uses
his
infernal
power
to
confound
corrupt
destroy
and
envelope
the
world
in
confusion
misery
and
distress
and
although
deprived
personally
of
operating
with
a
body
he
uses
his
influence
over
the
spirits
of
those
who
have
bodies
to
resist
goodness
virtue
purity
intelligence
and
the
fear
of
god
and
consequently
the
happiness
of
man
and
poor
erring
humanity
is
made
the
dupe
of
his
wiles
the
apostle
says
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
christ
who
is
the
image
of
god
should
shine
unto
them
cor
iv
but
not
content
with
the
ravages
he
has
made
the
spoliation
misery
and
distress
not
having
a
tabernacle
of
his
own
he
has
frequently
sought
to
occupy
that
of
man
in
order
that
he
might
yet
possess
greater
power
and
more
fully
accomplish
the
devastation
we
read
that
in
our
saviour
days
there
were
persons
possessed
with
devils
who
were
tormented
by
them
and
jesus
and
his
disciples
cast
them
out
mary
magdalene
was
dispossessed
of
seven
a
legion
had
entered
one
man
and
when
commanded
to
leave
rather
than
have
no
bodies
they
desired
permission
to
enter
those
of
swine
which
they
did
and
the
swine
were
destroyed
man
body
to
him
then
is
of
great
importance
and
if
he
only
knew
and
appreciated
his
privileges
he
might
live
above
the
temptation
of
satan
the
influence
of
corruption
subdue
his
lusts
overcome
the
world
and
triumph
and
enjoy
the
blessings
of
god
in
time
and
in
eternity
the
object
of
man
taking
a
body
is
that
through
the
redemption
of
jesus
christ
both
soul
and
body
may
be
exalted
in
the
eternal
world
when
the
earth
shall
be
celestial
and
to
obtain
a
higher
exaltation
than
he
would
be
capable
of
doing
without
a
body
for
when
man
was
first
made
he
was
made
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
heb
ii
but
through
the
atonement
and
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
he
is
placed
in
a
position
to
obtain
an
exaltation
higher
than
that
of
angels
says
the
apostle
know
ye
not
that
we
shall
judge
angels
cor
vi
jesus
descended
below
all
things
that
he
might
be
raised
above
all
things
he
took
upon
him
a
body
that
he
might
die
as
a
man
and
that
through
death
he
might
destroy
him
that
had
the
power
of
death
that
is
the
devil
heb
ii
having
conquered
death
then
in
his
own
dominions
burst
the
barriers
of
the
tomb
and
ascended
with
his
body
triumphant
to
the
right
hand
of
god
he
has
accomplished
a
purpose
which
god
had
decreed
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
opened
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
all
believers
hence
man
through
obedience
to
the
gospel
is
placed
in
a
position
to
be
an
adopted
son
of
god
and
have
a
legitimate
right
to
his
father
blessings
and
to
possess
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
apostle
says
that
if
the
spirit
of
him
that
raised
up
jesus
from
the
dead
dwell
in
you
he
that
raised
up
christ
from
the
dead
shall
also
quicken
your
mortal
bodies
by
his
spirit
that
dwelleth
in
you
rom
viii
thus
as
jesus
vanquished
death
so
may
we
as
he
overcame
so
may
we
and
if
faithful
sit
with
him
upon
his
throne
as
he
has
overcome
and
sat
down
upon
his
father
throne
rev
iii
thus
man
will
not
only
be
raised
from
degradation
but
will
also
be
exalted
to
a
seat
among
the
intelligences
which
surround
the
throne
of
god
this
is
one
great
object
of
our
coming
here
and
taking
bodies
another
object
that
we
came
here
for
and
took
bodies
was
to
propagate
our
species
for
if
it
is
for
our
benefit
to
come
here
it
is
also
for
the
benefit
of
others
hence
the
first
commandment
given
to
man
was
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
i
and
as
man
is
an
eternal
being
and
all
his
actions
have
a
relevancy
to
eternity
it
is
necessary
that
he
understand
his
position
well
and
thus
fulfil
the
measure
of
his
creation
for
as
he
and
his
offspring
are
destined
to
live
eternally
he
is
not
only
responsible
for
his
own
acts
but
in
a
great
measure
for
those
of
his
children
in
framing
their
minds
regulating
their
morals
setting
them
a
correct
example
and
teaching
them
correct
principles
but
more
especially
in
preserving
the
of
his
own
body
and
why
because
if
he
abuses
his
body
and
corrupts
himself
he
not
only
injures
himself
but
his
partner
and
associates
and
entails
misery
incalculable
upon
his
posterity
who
are
doomed
to
inherit
the
father
misery
and
this
is
not
only
associated
with
time
but
with
eternity
hence
the
lord
has
given
laws
regulating
marriage
and
chastity
of
the
strictest
kind
and
entailed
the
severest
punishment
upon
those
who
in
different
ages
have
abused
this
sacred
ordinance
for
example
the
curse
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
and
the
terrible
judgements
pronounced
against
those
who
should
corrupt
and
defile
their
bodies
let
any
one
read
deut
xxii
and
paul
says
know
ye
not
that
ye
are
the
temple
of
god
and
that
the
spirit
of
god
dwelleth
in
you
if
any
man
defile
the
temple
of
god
him
shall
god
destroy
cor
iii
whoremongers
and
adulterers
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
cor
vi
and
heb
xiii
and
why
because
man
being
made
a
free
agent
over
his
own
body
that
he
might
exalt
himself
and
posterity
both
in
time
and
in
eternity
if
he
abuses
that
power
he
not
only
affects
himself
but
unborn
bodies
and
spirits
corrupting
the
world
and
opening
the
flood
gates
of
vice
immorality
and
estrangement
from
god
hence
the
children
of
israel
were
told
not
to
marry
with
the
surrounding
nations
lest
their
seed
should
be
corrupted
and
the
people
turned
to
idolatry
which
would
lead
to
the
forgetfulness
of
god
to
an
ignorance
of
his
purposes
and
designs
and
cause
them
to
lose
sight
of
the
object
of
their
creation
and
corrupt
themselves
and
to
the
introduction
of
every
other
evil
as
a
natural
consequence
but
where
the
order
of
god
is
carried
out
it
places
things
in
a
lovely
position
what
is
more
amiable
and
pleasant
than
those
pure
innocent
endearing
affections
which
god
has
placed
in
the
hearts
of
the
man
and
woman
who
are
united
together
in
lawful
matrimony
with
a
love
and
confidence
pure
as
the
love
of
god
because
it
springs
from
him
and
is
his
gift
with
bodies
chaste
and
virtuous
and
an
offspring
lovely
healthy
innocent
and
uncontaminated
confiding
in
each
other
they
live
together
in
the
fear
of
god
enjoying
nature
gifts
uncorrupted
and
undefiled
as
the
driven
snow
or
the
crystal
stream
but
how
would
this
enjoyment
be
enhanced
if
they
understood
their
destiny
could
unravel
the
designs
of
god
and
contemplate
an
eternal
union
in
another
state
of
existence
a
connexion
with
their
offspring
commenced
here
to
endure
for
ever
and
all
their
ties
relationships
and
affections
strengthened
a
mother
feels
great
delight
in
beholding
her
child
and
gazing
on
its
lovely
infant
form
how
would
her
bosom
swell
with
ecstacy
at
the
contemplation
of
that
child
being
with
her
for
ever
and
if
we
only
understood
our
position
this
was
the
object
for
which
we
came
into
the
world
and
the
object
of
the
kingdom
of
god
is
to
all
those
holy
principles
chastity
and
purity
are
things
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
world
hence
the
prophet
says
because
the
lord
hath
been
witness
between
thee
and
the
wife
of
thy
youth
against
whom
thou
hast
dealt
treacherously
yet
is
she
thy
companion
and
the
wife
of
thy
covenant
and
did
not
he
make
one
yet
had
he
the
residue
of
the
spirit
and
wherefore
one
that
he
might
a
godly
therefore
take
heed
to
your
spirit
and
let
none
deal
treacherously
against
the
wife
of
his
youth
mal
ii
here
then
the
object
of
purity
is
pointed
out
clearly
and
what
is
it
that
god
might
preserve
a
godly
seed
paul
says
what
know
ye
not
that
he
who
is
joined
to
an
harlot
is
one
body
for
two
saith
he
shall
be
one
flesh
flee
fornication
every
sin
that
a
man
doeth
is
without
the
body
but
he
that
committeth
fornication
sinneth
against
his
own
body
what
know
ye
not
that
your
body
is
the
temple
of
the
holy
ghost
which
is
in
you
which
ye
have
of
god
and
ye
are
not
your
own
cor
vi
and
in
the
next
chapter
he
speaks
of
the
same
things
which
malachi
does
concerning
a
pure
seed
for
the
unbelieving
husband
is
sanctified
by
the
wife
and
the
unbelieving
wife
is
sanctified
by
the
husband
else
were
your
children
unclean
now
are
they
the
legislators
of
all
civilized
nations
have
seen
the
necessity
of
sustaining
these
things
and
consequently
have
passed
generally
very
rigid
laws
for
the
protection
of
female
virtue
and
the
support
of
the
marriage
contract
hence
acts
have
been
passed
and
enforced
disinheriting
those
who
were
not
born
in
wedlock
this
in
some
instances
has
produced
a
salutary
effect
ministers
of
the
various
churches
have
also
used
their
influence
in
a
great
measure
in
support
of
virtuous
principles
these
have
had
their
effect
in
assisting
to
stem
the
torrent
of
iniquity
but
as
the
nations
themselves
have
forsaken
god
how
can
they
expect
to
stop
this
crying
evil
for
the
very
legislators
who
pass
these
laws
are
in
many
instances
guilty
themselves
and
when
kings
princes
and
rulers
corrupt
themselves
how
can
they
expect
the
people
to
be
pure
for
no
matter
how
rigid
law
may
be
corrupt
persons
will
always
find
means
to
evade
it
and
indeed
so
far
have
these
abominations
gone
that
it
seems
to
be
an
admitted
fact
that
these
things
can
not
be
controlled
and
although
there
are
laws
relative
to
matrimonial
alliances
yet
there
are
some
nations
called
christian
who
actually
give
licence
for
prostitution
and
all
the
degradation
and
misery
associated
with
it
nor
are
these
things
connected
with
the
lower
ranks
of
life
only
wantonness
and
voluptuousness
go
hand
in
hand
and
revel
unchecked
in
courts
among
the
nobles
and
kings
of
the
earth
the
statesman
the
politician
and
the
merchant
the
mechanic
and
the
labourer
have
all
corrupted
themselves
the
world
is
full
of
adultery
intrigues
fornication
and
abominations
let
any
one
go
to
the
masked
balls
in
the
principal
theatres
in
paris
and
he
will
see
thousands
of
people
of
both
sexes
impudently
shamelessly
and
unblushingly
manifesting
their
lewd
dispositions
indeed
debauch
and
wantonness
bear
full
sway
not
to
speak
of
the
dens
of
abomination
that
exist
elsewhere
london
abounds
with
unfortunate
beings
led
on
by
example
seduction
and
misery
to
their
fallen
degraded
condition
the
same
thing
exists
throughout
england
france
the
united
states
and
all
nations
hence
millions
of
youth
corrupt
themselves
engender
the
most
loathsome
diseases
and
curse
their
posterity
with
their
sin
who
in
their
turn
rise
up
and
tread
in
the
corrupt
steps
of
their
fathers
not
to
say
anything
of
the
thousands
of
lovely
beings
whom
god
designed
for
companions
of
man
in
time
and
in
eternity
and
for
raising
up
a
pure
offspring
who
are
corrupted
degraded
polluted
fallen
poor
miserable
wretches
outcasts
of
society
insulted
oppressed
despised
and
abused
dragging
out
a
miserable
existence
led
on
from
one
degree
of
degradation
to
another
till
death
as
a
friend
closes
their
wretched
career
and
yet
without
hope
thus
man
that
was
made
pure
in
the
image
of
his
maker
that
could
stand
proudly
erect
as
the
representative
of
god
pure
and
uncontaminated
is
debased
fallen
corrupt
diseased
and
sunk
below
the
brute
creation
a
creature
of
lust
and
passion
and
a
slave
to
his
unbridled
appetites
i
write
plainly
on
this
subject
and
i
do
it
because
it
is
a
curse
to
the
world
and
god
will
have
a
reckoning
with
the
nations
for
these
things
in
vain
then
men
legislate
on
these
matters
the
nations
have
corrupted
themselves
and
these
things
are
beyond
their
control
men
must
be
governed
by
higher
and
purer
motives
than
merely
human
enactments
if
the
world
understood
its
true
position
and
the
eternal
consequences
to
them
and
their
seed
they
would
feel
different
they
would
feel
that
they
were
eternal
beings
that
they
were
responsible
to
god
both
for
their
bodies
and
spirits
nothing
but
a
knowledge
of
man
fall
and
true
position
and
the
development
of
the
kingdom
of
god
can
restore
him
to
his
proper
state
restore
the
order
and
economy
of
god
and
place
man
again
in
his
natural
position
on
the
earth
having
spoken
of
man
as
an
eternal
being
we
will
now
examine
what
relation
he
has
to
this
earth
for
it
is
the
government
of
god
that
we
wish
to
keep
our
minds
upon
this
earth
is
man
eternal
inheritance
where
he
will
exist
after
the
resurrection
for
it
is
destined
to
be
purified
and
become
celestial
i
know
that
this
position
is
considered
strange
by
many
because
it
is
generally
supposed
that
we
are
going
to
heaven
that
heaven
is
the
final
destination
of
the
righteous
and
that
when
we
leave
this
world
we
never
return
hence
wesley
says
beyond
the
bounds
of
time
and
space
look
forward
to
that
heavenly
place
the
saints
secure
abode
and
this
is
an
opinion
generally
believed
by
the
christian
world
we
shall
therefore
commence
by
enquiring
where
is
heaven
can
any
one
point
out
its
location
i
would
remark
that
it
is
a
word
of
almost
unlimited
signification
nevertheless
we
will
investigate
the
matter
a
little
we
read
that
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
furthermore
that
he
called
the
firmament
heaven
from
the
above
we
learn
that
the
heavens
were
created
by
the
lord
and
that
the
heavens
were
created
at
or
about
the
same
time
as
the
earth
and
that
the
firmament
is
called
heaven
we
are
further
told
concerning
the
firmament
that
god
separated
the
waters
that
were
below
the
firmament
from
those
that
were
above
the
firmament
hence
when
god
destroyed
the
world
with
a
flood
he
opened
the
windows
of
heaven
when
the
rain
ceased
he
shut
the
windows
of
heaven
now
a
word
on
this
firmament
where
is
it
and
god
said
let
the
waters
bring
forth
abundantly
the
moving
creature
that
hath
life
and
fowl
that
may
fly
above
the
earth
in
the
open
firmament
of
heaven
we
find
out
then
from
the
foregoing
that
the
firmament
is
called
heaven
the
heaven
associated
with
this
earth
and
that
the
firmament
is
the
place
where
the
birds
fly
and
the
rain
falls
from
heaven
and
the
scriptures
say
that
jesus
will
come
in
the
clouds
of
heaven
matt
xxiv
mark
xiii
but
there
are
other
heavens
for
god
created
this
heaven
and
this
earth
and
his
throne
existed
before
this
world
rolled
into
existence
or
the
morning
stars
sang
together
for
joy
for
heaven
is
god
throne
and
the
earth
is
his
footstool
solomon
says
the
heaven
of
heavens
can
not
contain
thee
this
heaven
is
veiled
from
mortal
vision
spirits
abound
but
we
can
not
see
them
and
angels
hover
there
but
to
us
are
invisible
and
can
only
be
known
or
seen
by
the
revelation
of
god
hence
paul
says
he
was
caught
up
into
the
heaven
stephen
saw
the
heavens
opened
and
jesus
sitting
on
the
right
hand
of
god
where
this
revelation
exists
there
exists
without
the
removal
of
the
body
a
perfect
knowledge
of
things
as
they
are
known
to
god
so
far
as
they
are
revealed
thus
when
john
was
on
the
isle
of
patmos
he
says
i
was
in
the
spirit
on
the
lord
day
and
heard
behind
me
a
great
voice
as
of
a
trumpet
saying
i
am
alpha
and
omega
the
first
and
the
last
and
what
thou
seest
write
in
a
book
rev
i
then
commenced
the
revelation
it
was
the
same
also
with
stephen
from
this
we
gather
that
there
is
a
veil
that
obscures
the
heavens
from
our
sight
but
when
that
veil
is
removed
and
our
vision
is
enlightened
by
the
spirit
of
god
then
we
can
gaze
upon
the
glories
of
the
eternal
world
and
heaven
is
opened
for
our
view
when
persons
are
taken
from
the
earth
and
hid
from
our
view
it
is
said
they
are
gone
to
heaven
hence
it
is
said
that
elijah
went
by
a
whirlwind
into
heaven
kings
ii
and
it
is
also
said
of
jesus
that
while
he
blessed
them
he
was
parted
from
them
and
carried
up
into
heaven
luke
xxiv
but
it
is
the
destination
of
the
saints
that
we
have
to
do
with
and
on
this
i
would
remark
that
there
are
many
glories
and
man
will
be
judged
according
to
his
deeds
there
is
one
glory
of
the
sun
and
another
glory
of
the
moon
and
another
glory
of
the
stars
for
as
one
star
differeth
from
another
star
in
glory
so
also
is
the
resurrection
cor
xv
it
would
not
comport
with
my
object
at
the
present
time
to
enter
into
the
whole
of
the
details
of
this
subject
i
would
briefly
remark
however
inasmuch
as
i
am
now
talking
of
man
body
that
there
is
a
place
called
paradise
to
which
the
spirits
of
the
dead
go
awaiting
the
resurrection
and
their
reunion
with
the
body
this
was
an
old
doctrine
of
the
jews
paul
too
was
caught
up
into
paradise
and
heard
unspeakable
words
cor
xii
john
says
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
grant
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
paradise
of
god
rev
ii
this
paradise
however
is
not
the
place
for
resurrected
bodies
but
for
departed
spirits
for
jesus
said
to
the
thief
on
the
cross
to
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
luke
xxiii
two
days
after
this
and
after
the
resurrection
of
his
body
mary
was
looking
for
the
lord
and
he
appeared
to
her
he
said
to
her
touch
me
not
for
i
am
not
yet
ascended
to
my
father
but
go
to
my
brethren
and
say
unto
them
i
ascend
unto
my
father
and
your
father
and
to
my
god
and
your
god
john
xx
we
learn
here
then
that
jesus
went
to
paradise
with
the
thief
on
the
cross
in
spirit
but
that
he
had
not
been
with
his
body
to
his
father
we
will
now
speak
of
heaven
as
a
place
of
reward
for
the
righteous
daniel
in
speaking
of
the
resurrection
says
many
of
them
that
sleep
in
the
dust
of
the
earth
shall
awake
some
to
everlasting
life
and
some
to
shame
and
everlasting
contempt
dan
xii
jesus
says
those
who
have
forsaken
all
and
followed
him
shall
inherit
everlasting
life
matt
xix
there
is
also
a
book
of
life
spoken
of
paul
speaks
of
some
whose
names
were
written
therein
phil
iv
john
also
refers
to
the
same
things
he
says
he
that
overcometh
the
same
shall
be
clothed
in
white
raiment
and
i
will
not
blot
out
his
name
out
of
the
book
of
life
rev
iii
again
john
in
speaking
of
the
new
jerusalem
says
there
shall
not
enter
into
it
anything
that
worketh
abomination
or
maketh
a
lie
but
they
which
are
written
in
the
lamb
book
of
life
rev
xxi
from
this
it
would
appear
that
those
who
obey
all
the
commandments
of
god
and
have
their
names
written
in
the
lamb
book
of
life
shall
finally
enter
into
the
new
jerusalem
jesus
again
says
to
him
that
overcometh
will
i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
even
as
i
also
overcame
and
am
sat
down
with
my
father
in
his
throne
rev
iii
this
then
is
the
heaven
as
far
as
i
can
conceive
that
people
expect
to
go
to
we
will
now
try
to
find
out
its
location
above
we
have
noticed
that
the
saints
are
to
have
everlasting
life
that
they
are
to
be
with
jesus
and
also
in
the
new
jerusalem
we
have
now
to
enquire
where
jesus
kingdom
will
be
and
where
will
be
the
place
of
the
new
jerusalem
daniel
says
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
one
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
and
there
was
given
him
dominion
and
glory
and
a
kingdom
that
all
people
nations
and
languages
should
serve
him
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
which
shall
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
dan
vii
here
then
we
find
jesus
coming
to
establish
a
kingdom
where
is
that
kingdom
the
scriptures
say
that
all
nations
languages
and
tongues
shall
serve
and
obey
him
where
do
those
nations
languages
and
tongues
exist
the
answer
is
on
the
earth
we
will
next
enquire
where
the
saints
will
be
daniel
says
in
the
verse
and
the
kingdom
and
dominion
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
shall
be
given
to
the
people
of
the
saints
of
the
most
high
here
then
we
find
jesus
reigning
under
the
whole
heaven
with
his
saints
and
all
nations
dominions
and
powers
serving
him
i
noticed
above
that
those
who
overcame
would
be
with
jesus
and
with
him
have
everlasting
life
zechariah
speaks
of
a
time
when
there
will
be
a
great
assemblage
of
people
against
jerusalem
after
god
ancient
people
the
jews
shall
have
been
gathered
there
and
the
lord
himself
shall
come
forth
to
their
defence
he
says
then
shall
the
lord
go
forth
and
fight
against
those
nations
as
when
he
fought
in
the
day
of
battle
and
his
feet
shall
stand
in
that
day
upon
the
mount
of
olives
which
is
before
jerusalem
on
the
east
and
the
mount
of
olives
shall
cleave
in
the
midst
thereof
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
valley
and
half
of
the
mountain
shall
remove
toward
the
north
and
half
of
it
toward
the
south
and
ye
shall
flee
to
the
valley
of
the
mountains
for
the
valley
of
the
mountains
shall
reach
unto
azal
yea
ye
shall
flee
like
as
ye
fled
from
before
the
earthquake
in
the
days
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
and
the
lord
my
god
shall
come
and
all
the
saints
with
thee
and
the
lord
shall
be
king
all
the
in
that
day
there
shall
be
one
lord
and
his
name
one
xiv
here
we
find
that
jesus
is
to
come
and
his
are
to
come
with
him
and
that
the
lord
is
to
be
king
over
the
the
question
again
arises
where
will
jesus
reign
with
his
saints
the
answer
is
the
again
we
will
refer
to
the
revelations
of
john
he
says
i
saw
the
souls
of
them
that
were
beheaded
for
the
witness
of
jesus
and
for
the
word
of
god
and
they
lived
and
reigned
with
christ
a
thousand
years
rev
xx
and
if
we
wish
to
know
where
they
will
reign
we
will
again
let
john
speak
for
thou
wast
slain
and
hast
redeemed
us
to
god
by
thy
blood
out
of
every
kindred
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation
and
hast
made
us
unto
our
god
kings
and
priests
and
we
shall
reign
the
rev
it
is
not
necessary
to
quote
more
on
this
subject
it
is
so
plain
that
he
that
runs
may
read
i
know
that
there
are
those
who
will
tell
us
that
this
is
not
the
final
destination
of
the
saints
i
would
here
remark
that
a
great
many
events
will
take
place
in
regard
to
the
renovation
of
the
earth
which
it
would
be
foreign
to
my
subject
at
the
present
time
to
detail
i
would
state
however
that
when
the
earth
shall
have
become
pure
if
people
suppose
that
they
will
then
inhabit
a
heaven
not
on
the
earth
they
are
mistaken
for
if
we
have
the
good
fortune
to
have
our
names
written
in
the
lamb
book
of
life
and
to
enter
into
the
new
jerusalem
we
shall
in
that
very
new
jerusalem
have
to
descend
to
the
earth
methinks
i
hear
persons
saying
what
shall
we
not
then
stay
in
heaven
yes
in
heaven
but
that
heaven
will
be
on
the
earth
for
john
says
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
past
away
purified
by
fire
and
become
celestial
and
there
was
no
more
sea
and
i
john
saw
the
holy
city
new
jerusalem
coming
down
from
god
out
of
heaven
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
and
i
heard
a
great
voice
out
of
heaven
saying
behold
the
tabernacle
of
god
is
with
men
and
he
will
dwell
with
them
and
they
shall
be
his
people
and
god
himself
shall
be
with
them
and
be
their
god
and
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
rev
xxi
here
then
we
find
man
final
dwelling
place
is
the
earth
and
for
this
purpose
it
was
first
created
and
it
never
will
fulfil
the
measure
of
its
creation
until
this
shall
take
place
nor
will
man
ever
attain
to
the
end
for
which
he
was
created
till
his
spirit
and
his
body
are
purified
and
he
takes
his
proper
position
on
the
earth
the
prophets
of
god
in
every
age
have
looked
forward
to
this
time
and
while
many
considered
them
to
be
fools
they
were
laying
for
themselves
an
eternal
foundation
they
looked
with
scorn
upon
the
gaudy
baubles
that
fascinated
foolish
and
corrupt
man
they
could
not
yield
to
his
chicanery
and
deception
but
with
the
fear
of
god
before
their
eyes
and
a
knowledge
of
the
future
they
stood
proudly
erect
in
a
consciousness
of
their
innocence
and
integrity
despised
alike
the
praise
and
powers
of
men
endured
afflictions
privations
and
death
wandered
in
sheep
skins
and
goat
skins
destitute
tormented
and
afflicted
for
they
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
heb
xi
hence
job
says
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
the
and
though
after
my
skin
worms
destroy
this
body
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
xix
man
naturally
clings
to
this
earth
there
seems
to
be
something
inherent
in
his
nature
that
draws
and
binds
his
affections
to
the
earth
hence
he
strives
all
that
lays
in
his
power
to
possess
as
much
land
as
he
can
reasonably
obtain
and
not
always
honestly
but
wars
have
been
waged
for
the
acquisition
of
territory
and
the
possessions
of
the
earth
but
what
avails
it
all
without
god
so
far
from
benefiting
man
it
is
an
injury
if
obtained
by
fraud
for
he
has
got
to
pass
that
test
which
none
can
avoid
and
if
circumstances
here
give
him
the
power
over
his
brother
when
he
leaves
this
world
and
appears
before
god
he
goes
to
be
judged
for
that
very
act
of
oppression
and
the
thing
that
he
so
anxiously
desired
to
obtain
in
this
world
is
his
curse
in
the
next
an
honourable
desire
for
property
is
not
wrong
but
no
man
can
have
a
lasting
claim
unless
it
is
given
him
of
god
lands
properties
possessions
and
the
blessings
of
this
life
are
of
use
only
as
they
are
sanctified
and
have
a
bearing
on
the
world
to
come
there
have
been
hereditary
laws
established
in
england
and
i
believe
in
other
countries
securing
landed
possessions
to
the
eldest
son
or
heir
this
has
originated
from
the
above
feeling
and
partly
from
the
customs
of
the
ancient
israelites
as
recorded
in
the
scriptures
and
families
through
this
means
seek
to
perpetuate
their
names
they
may
do
this
for
a
season
but
if
man
rightly
understood
his
true
position
he
would
have
a
brighter
object
in
view
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
every
good
and
perfect
gift
comes
from
god
that
a
man
can
receive
nothing
but
what
is
given
him
from
above
men
have
conquered
and
taken
bought
and
sold
the
earth
without
god
but
their
possessions
will
perish
with
them
they
may
perpetuate
them
by
law
for
a
season
to
their
descendants
but
the
saints
of
god
will
finally
inherit
the
earth
for
ever
in
time
and
in
eternity
abraham
held
his
possessions
on
a
very
different
footing
from
the
above
the
lord
appeared
unto
him
and
made
a
covenant
with
him
and
said
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
and
to
thy
seed
after
thee
the
land
wherein
thou
art
a
stranger
all
the
land
of
canaan
for
an
xvii
this
covenant
was
an
eternal
one
yet
abraham
did
not
possess
the
land
for
stephen
says
he
gave
him
none
inheritance
in
it
no
not
so
much
as
to
set
his
foot
on
acts
vii
and
paul
says
by
faith
abraham
when
he
was
called
to
go
out
into
a
place
which
he
should
after
receive
for
an
inheritance
obeyed
and
he
went
out
not
knowing
whither
he
went
by
faith
he
sojourned
in
the
land
of
promise
as
in
a
strange
country
dwelling
in
tabernacles
with
isaac
and
jacob
the
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
promise
for
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
heb
xi
here
then
we
find
land
given
to
abraham
by
promise
a
land
that
he
did
not
possess
but
he
will
do
so
for
he
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
he
looked
forward
to
the
redemption
of
his
seed
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
inheritance
of
those
blessings
eternally
if
any
one
doubts
this
let
them
read
the
xxxi
chapter
of
jeremiah
and
the
xxxvi
to
xxxix
chapters
of
ezekiel
wherein
it
is
stated
that
israel
is
to
be
gathered
to
their
own
land
that
it
is
to
become
as
the
garden
of
eden
and
to
be
no
more
desolate
ezekiel
speaks
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
coming
together
of
the
bones
flesh
sinews
and
skin
of
a
living
army
of
the
uniting
of
the
nations
of
judah
and
israel
in
one
and
in
consequence
of
the
great
development
of
the
powers
of
god
the
heathen
would
be
filled
with
astonishment
and
finally
that
god
tabernacle
should
be
planted
in
their
midst
for
evermore
then
let
them
read
from
the
xlvii
to
the
last
chapter
of
ezekiel
and
they
will
find
an
account
not
only
of
the
restoration
of
the
jews
and
ten
tribes
but
that
the
land
is
actually
divided
to
them
by
inheritance
in
their
different
tribes
according
to
the
promise
made
thousands
of
years
before
to
abraham
in
the
and
verses
of
the
xlvii
chapter
he
refers
to
this
and
says
thus
saith
the
lord
god
this
shall
be
the
border
whereby
ye
shall
inherit
the
land
according
to
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
joseph
shall
have
two
portions
and
ye
shall
inherit
it
one
as
well
as
another
concerning
the
which
lifted
up
mine
hand
to
give
it
unto
your
and
this
land
shall
fall
unto
you
for
an
inheritance
thus
we
find
that
the
promise
unto
abraham
concerning
territory
will
be
literally
fulfilled
again
i
would
refer
my
readers
to
the
fourteenth
chapter
of
zechariah
i
would
then
turn
their
attention
to
the
sealing
of
the
twelve
tribes
mentioned
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
revelations
where
there
are
twelve
thousand
out
of
every
tribe
sealed
and
then
ask
where
are
these
to
reign
the
answer
is
the
together
with
those
who
have
washed
their
robes
and
made
them
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
out
of
every
nation
and
kindred
and
people
and
tongue
jesus
says
abraham
saw
my
day
and
was
glad
what
was
he
glad
to
see
his
people
scattered
dispersed
and
peeled
jerusalem
trodden
under
foot
the
jewish
nation
temple
and
polity
destroyed
and
his
seed
cursed
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
or
was
it
the
second
coming
of
jesus
when
they
would
be
restored
satan
bound
the
promises
made
to
him
and
to
his
seed
fulfilled
and
misery
and
sorrow
done
away
for
according
to
the
testimony
of
paul
all
israel
shall
be
saved
abraham
views
concerning
land
and
possessions
were
not
the
same
as
those
entertained
by
men
in
our
day
they
were
not
only
temporal
but
eternal
and
if
the
world
was
under
the
guidance
of
the
same
god
as
abraham
they
would
be
governed
by
the
same
principle
and
anything
short
of
this
is
transient
temporary
short
lived
and
does
not
accomplish
the
purpose
of
man
creation
i
can
not
conclude
this
subject
better
than
by
giving
a
quotation
from
pratt
voice
of
warning
by
this
time
we
begin
to
understand
the
words
of
the
saviour
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
and
also
the
song
which
john
heard
in
heaven
which
ended
thus
shall
reign
on
the
earth
reader
do
not
be
startled
suppose
you
were
to
be
caught
up
into
heaven
there
to
stand
with
the
redeemed
of
every
nation
kindred
tongue
and
people
and
join
them
in
singing
and
to
your
astonishment
all
heaven
is
filled
with
joy
while
they
tune
the
immortal
lyre
in
joyful
anticipation
of
one
day
reigning
on
the
earth
a
planet
now
under
the
dominion
of
satan
the
abode
of
wretchedness
and
misery
from
which
your
glad
spirit
had
taken
its
flight
and
as
you
supposed
an
everlasting
farewell
you
might
perhaps
be
startled
for
a
moment
and
enquire
within
yourself
why
have
i
never
heard
this
theme
sung
among
the
churches
on
earth
well
my
friend
the
answer
would
be
because
you
lived
in
a
day
when
people
did
not
understand
the
scriptures
abraham
would
tell
you
you
should
have
read
the
promise
of
god
to
him
xvii
where
god
not
only
promised
the
land
of
canaan
to
his
seed
for
an
everlasting
possession
but
also
to
him
then
you
should
have
read
the
testimony
of
stephen
acts
vii
by
which
you
would
have
ascertained
that
abraham
never
had
inherited
the
things
promised
but
was
still
expecting
to
rise
from
the
dead
and
be
brought
into
the
land
of
canaan
to
inherit
them
yes
says
ezekiel
if
you
had
read
the
xxxvii
chapter
of
my
prophecies
you
would
have
found
a
positive
promise
that
god
would
open
the
graves
of
the
whole
house
of
israel
who
were
dead
and
gather
up
their
dry
bones
and
put
them
together
each
to
its
own
proper
place
and
even
clothe
them
again
with
flesh
sinews
and
skin
and
put
his
spirit
in
them
and
they
should
live
and
then
instead
of
being
caught
up
to
heaven
they
should
be
brought
into
the
land
of
canaan
which
the
lord
gave
them
and
they
should
inherit
it
but
still
astonished
you
might
turn
to
job
and
he
surprised
to
find
one
unacquainted
with
so
plain
a
subject
would
exclaim
did
you
never
read
my
xix
chapter
from
the
to
the
verses
where
i
declare
i
wish
my
words
were
printed
in
a
book
saying
that
my
redeemer
would
stand
on
the
earth
in
the
latter
day
and
that
i
should
see
him
in
the
flesh
for
myself
and
not
another
though
worms
should
destroy
this
body
even
david
the
sweet
singer
of
israel
would
call
to
your
mind
his
xxxvii
psalm
where
he
repeatedly
declares
that
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
for
ever
after
the
wicked
are
cut
off
from
the
face
thereof
and
last
of
all
to
set
the
matter
for
ever
at
rest
the
voice
of
the
saviour
would
mildly
fall
upon
your
ear
in
his
sermon
on
the
mount
declaring
emphatically
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
to
these
things
you
would
answer
i
have
read
these
passages
to
be
sure
but
was
always
taught
to
believe
that
they
did
not
mean
so
therefore
i
never
understood
them
until
now
let
me
go
and
tell
the
people
what
wonders
have
opened
to
my
view
since
my
arrival
in
heaven
merely
from
having
heard
one
short
song
it
is
true
i
have
heard
much
of
the
glories
of
heaven
described
while
on
earth
but
never
once
thought
of
their
rejoicing
in
anticipation
of
returning
to
the
earth
says
the
saviour
have
moses
and
the
prophets
if
they
will
not
believe
them
neither
would
they
believe
although
one
should
rise
from
the
dead

this
is
an
excellent
work
and
well
worthy
of
any
one
j
chapter
vi
man
accountability
to
god
this
is
a
subject
which
it
may
be
necessary
for
us
to
inquire
into
in
order
that
we
may
find
out
how
far
man
is
responsible
for
if
man
be
not
a
moral
agent
he
can
not
be
responsible
for
the
present
position
of
the
world
and
it
would
be
unjust
in
god
to
punish
him
for
acts
that
were
not
his
and
for
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
scriptures
we
shall
find
that
man
has
had
certain
powers
vested
in
his
hands
which
he
holds
subject
to
the
control
and
guidance
of
the
lord
and
that
if
he
has
acted
without
the
counsel
guidance
or
instruction
of
god
he
has
gone
beyond
the
limits
assigned
him
by
the
lord
and
is
as
much
culpable
as
a
minister
plenipotentiary
of
any
nation
would
be
who
should
exceed
the
limits
of
his
instructions
or
a
man
holding
a
farm
or
vineyard
by
a
certain
lease
if
he
should
disregard
the
conditions
of
that
lease
and
destroy
the
farm
or
vineyard
for
the
earth
is
the
lord
and
man
was
put
on
it
by
the
lord
it
is
not
man
possession
only
as
he
holds
it
from
god
man
body
was
given
him
by
god
and
also
his
spirit
for
the
purpose
heretofore
mentioned
god
had
his
object
in
view
in
the
creation
of
the
world
and
of
man
which
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
investigate
and
if
man
is
placed
as
an
agent
to
act
for
the
lord
and
also
for
himself
and
then
should
neglect
the
lord
he
would
certainly
be
held
responsible
to
his
creator
that
god
had
an
object
in
view
in
regard
to
the
creation
of
the
world
is
evident
or
why
was
there
a
consultation
in
heaven
about
it
why
the
beautiful
regulation
of
sun
moon
and
stars
why
the
provision
made
for
the
redemption
of
man
before
he
came
here
for
christ
was
the
lamb
slain
from
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
why
the
arrangement
of
the
resurrection
the
new
jerusalem
and
the
reign
of
jesus
on
the
earth
will
any
one
say
that
all
these
things
were
done
and
all
nature
organized
in
its
present
beauty
and
order
without
a
design
it
would
be
preposterous
if
god
has
a
design
in
those
things
and
man
by
his
wilfulness
wickedness
corruption
and
rebellion
should
thwart
the
design
of
god
and
yield
himself
to
another
influence
even
that
of
satan
will
he
not
be
held
responsible
and
whether
god
has
a
particular
design
or
not
does
not
affect
the
question
particularly
for
the
earth
is
the
lord
and
man
also
and
god
has
a
perfect
right
to
dictate
what
laws
he
pleases
that
the
lord
looks
upon
the
world
in
this
manner
is
evident
from
the
words
of
our
saviour
there
was
a
certain
householder
which
planted
a
vineyard
and
hedged
it
round
about
and
digged
a
in
it
and
built
a
tower
and
let
it
out
to
husbandmen
and
went
into
a
far
country
and
when
the
time
of
the
fruit
drew
near
he
sent
his
servants
to
the
husbandmen
that
they
might
receive
the
fruits
of
it
and
the
husbandmen
took
his
servants
and
beat
one
and
killed
another
and
stoned
another
again
he
sent
other
servants
more
than
the
first
and
they
did
unto
them
likewise
but
last
of
all
he
sent
unto
them
his
son
saying
they
will
reverence
my
son
but
when
the
husbandmen
saw
the
son
they
said
among
themselves
this
is
the
heir
come
let
us
kill
him
and
let
us
seize
on
his
inheritance
and
they
caught
him
and
cast
him
out
of
the
vineyard
and
slew
him
when
the
lord
therefore
of
the
vineyard
cometh
what
will
he
do
unto
those
husbandmen
they
say
unto
him
he
will
miserably
destroy
those
wicked
men
and
will
let
out
his
vineyard
unto
other
husbandmen
which
shall
render
him
the
fruits
in
their
seasons
jesus
saith
unto
them
did
ye
never
read
in
the
scriptures
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
the
same
is
become
the
head
of
the
corner
this
is
the
lord
doing
and
it
is
marvellous
in
our
eyes
therefore
say
i
unto
you
the
kingdom
of
god
shall
be
taken
from
you
and
given
to
a
nation
bringing
forth
the
fruits
thereof
and
whosoever
shall
fall
on
this
stone
shall
be
broken
but
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
will
grind
him
to
powder
matt
xxi
here
then
the
thing
is
clearly
developd
man
agency
the
abuse
of
that
agency
the
punishment
inflicted
for
that
abuse
together
with
the
awful
consequences
of
resistance
to
the
proper
authority
on
whomsoever
it
shall
fall
it
shall
grind
him
to
powder
god
never
gave
man
unlimited
control
of
the
affairs
of
this
world
but
always
speaks
of
man
as
being
under
his
guidance
inhabiting
his
territory
and
responsible
to
him
for
his
acts
the
world
is
his
vineyard
and
man
is
the
agent
hence
when
god
made
man
god
blessed
him
and
god
said
unto
him
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
earth
this
then
was
man
dominion
him
by
the
and
the
word
continues
god
gave
every
herb
bearing
seed
and
every
tree
in
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
tree
these
things
were
given
by
god
but
to
show
his
power
and
his
right
to
be
obeyed
and
in
order
to
test
man
he
forbid
his
eating
of
a
certain
tree
and
when
he
did
eat
of
it
and
thus
broke
the
commandment
of
god
he
thrust
him
out
of
the
garden
and
decreed
that
he
should
eat
his
bread
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
again
god
demanded
worship
and
sacrifices
and
when
cain
and
abel
offered
them
he
received
one
and
rejected
the
other
and
further
when
cain
was
wroth
on
account
of
his
sacrifice
not
being
accepted
the
lord
said
to
him
why
art
thou
wroth
and
why
is
thy
countenance
fallen
if
thou
doest
well
shalt
thou
not
be
accepted
and
if
thou
doest
not
well
sin
lieth
at
the
door
iv
after
the
destruction
of
the
world
which
was
in
consequence
of
the
people
sinning
against
god
he
blessed
noah
and
spake
to
him
and
gave
him
the
same
dominion
which
had
been
given
before
to
adam
and
noah
offered
sacrifices
to
him
the
same
recognition
of
the
almighty
power
and
authority
was
manifested
by
abraham
moses
the
children
of
israel
and
the
prophets
by
jesus
also
and
the
primitive
christians
man
was
left
as
a
free
agent
with
power
to
act
and
vested
with
certain
powers
by
his
father
and
responsible
to
him
for
his
acts
as
a
son
servant
or
agent
would
be
to
his
father
master
or
employer
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correctly
conveyed
thus
a
man
lets
or
rents
a
vineyard
or
farm
the
man
occupying
it
has
a
certain
agency
and
discretionary
power
vested
in
his
hands
but
always
subject
to
certain
conditions
imposed
by
the
owner
of
the
property
hence
god
made
a
covenant
with
noah
abraham
the
children
of
israel
and
the
primitive
saints
the
making
of
a
covenant
naturally
implies
two
parties
in
such
cases
god
is
one
the
people
the
other
if
the
people
fulfil
their
covenant
the
lord
is
bound
to
fulfil
his
but
if
man
transgresses
then
the
lord
is
not
bound
to
fulfil
his
engagement
for
instance
in
speaking
to
ancient
israel
he
said
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
if
thou
shalt
hearken
diligently
unto
the
voice
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
observe
and
to
do
all
the
commandments
which
i
command
thee
this
day
that
the
lord
thy
god
will
set
thee
on
high
above
all
nations
of
the
earth
deut
xxviii
he
then
describes
what
those
blessings
are
and
further
states
that
if
they
do
not
observe
his
statutes
they
shall
be
cursed
the
lord
set
before
them
blessings
and
cursings
blessings
if
they
obeyed
but
cursings
if
they
disobeyed
man
then
acts
as
a
moral
agent
to
improve
upon
the
blessings
which
god
puts
within
his
power
or
not
as
he
pleases
and
it
is
the
abuse
of
this
moral
agency
which
has
filled
the
world
with
misery
and
distress
a
footnote
a
this
part
of
the
subject
is
fully
explained
in
the
remarks
on
the
government
of
man
chap
ii
man
has
lost
sight
of
the
object
of
his
creation
and
his
future
destiny
and
losing
sight
of
his
origin
his
relationship
to
god
and
his
future
destiny
he
has
fallen
into
the
mazes
of
ignorance
superstition
and
iniquity
and
is
groping
in
the
dark
and
knows
not
how
to
conduct
himself
in
this
world
or
how
to
prepare
for
the
world
to
come
for
instead
of
being
governed
by
the
spirit
wisdom
and
revelations
of
god
he
is
governed
by
the
spirit
of
the
evil
one
the
god
of
this
world
who
rules
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
disobedience
they
have
left
god
and
submitted
themselves
to
his
evil
sway
and
used
that
agency
which
god
has
given
to
them
not
only
in
rejecting
god
but
in
obeying
satan
and
furthering
his
designs
which
are
in
opposition
to
those
of
god
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
the
salvation
of
the
world
i
know
there
are
many
who
will
ridicule
this
idea
but
it
is
a
thing
which
is
plain
in
the
scriptures
the
apostle
paul
says
the
god
of
this
world
hath
blinded
the
minds
of
them
which
believe
not
lest
the
light
of
the
glorious
gospel
of
christ
who
is
the
image
of
god
should
shine
unto
them
cor
iv
and
if
any
man
thinks
he
is
wise
he
has
his
moral
agency
and
the
world
before
him
and
if
he
can
improve
the
situation
of
the
world
without
god
he
has
ample
opportunity
to
display
his
intelligence
i
would
remark
further
that
so
far
from
satan
not
exercising
this
power
over
man
he
exercises
it
to
such
an
extent
and
he
possesses
such
an
unbounded
influence
over
the
human
family
that
god
purposes
relative
to
man
and
the
earth
never
can
be
carried
out
until
satan
is
bound
and
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
john
says
and
i
saw
an
angel
come
down
from
heaven
having
the
key
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
great
chain
in
his
hand
and
he
laid
hold
on
the
dragon
that
old
serpent
which
is
the
devil
and
satan
and
bound
him
a
thousand
years
and
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit
and
shut
him
up
and
set
a
seal
upon
him
that
he
should
deceive
the
nations
no
more
till
the
thousand
years
should
be
fulfilled
rev
xx
here
then
he
is
described
as
the
and
his
power
is
curtailed
for
a
season
that
he
shall
not
possess
it
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
persuade
men
that
they
are
deceived
because
that
very
power
that
deceives
them
inflates
the
mind
with
and
assurance
but
who
that
looks
abroad
in
the
world
and
sees
the
confusion
distress
and
misery
that
abound
will
say
that
man
has
acted
wisely
man
then
is
a
moral
agent
possessing
the
power
to
do
good
or
to
do
evil
if
he
does
well
he
fulfils
the
measure
of
his
creation
and
secures
his
happiness
in
time
and
in
eternity
if
he
does
not
well
and
is
involved
in
difficulties
and
misery
it
is
his
own
fault
and
he
may
blame
himself
there
are
many
circumstances
over
which
man
individually
has
no
control
but
i
am
speaking
more
particularly
of
nations
and
the
world
and
man
moral
agency
associated
with
them
concerning
individuals
the
lord
will
make
his
own
arrangements
the
jews
are
cursed
nationally
on
account
of
their
transgression
and
can
not
remove
that
curse
as
a
nation
until
the
time
come
as
individuals
they
can
receive
the
gospel
as
well
as
others
their
fathers
committed
grievous
national
offences
against
god
for
some
length
of
time
and
finally
filled
up
the
measure
of
their
iniquity
in
rejecting
and
crucifying
the
son
of
god
if
they
killed
the
prophets
and
stoned
those
whom
god
sent
how
could
he
treat
with
them
he
could
act
no
other
way
consistently
than
to
destroy
those
husbandmen
and
give
the
vineyard
to
others
for
if
god
be
the
proprietor
of
the
vineyard
and
has
a
right
to
confer
national
blessings
for
obedience
he
has
also
a
right
to
visit
them
with
national
curses
for
disobedience
a
nation
rejecting
god
and
his
ordinances
and
killing
his
prophets
and
still
professing
to
be
his
people
act
hypocritically
and
impose
a
great
curse
upon
posterity
and
if
men
will
not
acknowledge
god
how
can
they
expect
him
to
acknowledge
and
bless
them
again
there
are
heathen
nations
enveloped
in
idolatry
and
if
millions
of
people
came
into
the
world
in
those
places
surrounded
with
idolatry
and
superstition
it
would
be
unjust
for
them
to
be
punished
for
what
they
did
not
know
hence
if
they
have
no
law
they
will
be
judged
without
law
and
god
in
his
own
wisdom
will
regulate
their
affairs
for
it
is
their
misfortune
not
their
individual
offence
that
has
placed
them
in
their
present
position
if
however
we
could
trace
their
history
we
should
find
as
with
the
israelites
so
with
them
their
present
darkness
and
misery
originated
in
a
departure
from
god
and
as
their
fathers
did
not
desire
to
retain
god
in
their
knowledge
he
gave
them
up
to
their
present
darkness
confusion
and
wretchedness
see
paul
remarks
on
this
subject
rom
i
for
nationally
the
conduct
of
fathers
has
a
great
influence
over
their
children
as
well
as
in
a
family
capacity
hence
the
jews
will
be
blessed
as
a
nation
in
consequence
of
the
promises
made
to
abraham
for
as
i
have
said
before
these
are
eternal
principles
man
is
an
eternal
being
and
all
his
actions
have
a
relevancy
to
eternity
the
actions
of
fathers
have
a
bearing
and
influence
on
their
children
both
as
families
and
nations
in
time
and
in
eternity
and
those
great
principles
that
god
has
his
eye
upon
in
relation
to
the
nations
and
to
the
world
will
certainly
be
accomplished
hence
the
stimulus
to
excite
men
to
tread
in
the
steps
of
abraham
that
like
him
they
may
obtain
blessings
for
themselves
and
their
posterity
and
hence
the
choice
of
abraham
by
the
lord
the
lord
said
i
know
him
that
he
will
command
his
children
and
his
household
after
him
and
they
shall
keep
the
way
of
the
lord
xviii
and
why
did
the
lord
feel
anxious
about
this
because
of
his
own
purposes
in
relation
to
the
earth
and
because
of
his
parental
care
of
the
bodies
and
spirits
of
man
for
there
are
matters
of
great
importance
associated
with
these
things
as
before
referred
to
and
the
lord
has
felt
very
anxious
for
the
perpetuation
of
correct
principles
so
strong
were
his
feelings
in
relation
to
this
matter
that
he
gave
the
following
law
to
the
children
of
israel
if
thy
brother
the
son
of
thy
mother
or
thy
son
or
thy
daughter
or
the
wife
of
thy
bosom
or
thy
friend
which
is
as
thine
own
soul
entice
thee
secretly
saying
let
us
go
and
serve
other
gods
which
thou
hast
not
known
thou
nor
thy
fathers
namely
of
the
gods
of
the
people
which
are
round
about
you
nigh
unto
thee
or
far
off
from
thee
from
the
one
end
of
the
earth
even
unto
the
other
end
of
the
earth
thou
shalt
not
consent
unto
him
nor
hearken
unto
him
neither
shalt
thine
eye
pity
him
neither
shalt
thou
spare
neither
shalt
thou
conceal
him
but
thou
shalt
surely
kill
him
thine
hand
shall
be
first
upon
him
to
put
him
to
death
and
afterwards
the
hand
of
all
the
people
and
thou
shalt
stone
him
with
stones
that
he
die
because
he
hath
sought
to
thrust
thee
away
from
the
lord
thy
god
which
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
deut
xiii
here
then
it
is
stated
that
if
brother
son
wife
or
any
one
wish
to
lead
thee
from
god
thou
shalt
destroy
them
and
why
because
in
forsaking
god
they
lose
sight
of
their
eternal
existence
corrupt
themselves
and
entail
misery
on
their
posterity
hence
it
was
better
to
destroy
a
few
individuals
than
to
entail
misery
on
many
and
hence
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
world
and
of
the
cities
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
were
destroyed
because
it
was
better
for
them
to
die
and
thus
be
deprived
of
their
agency
which
they
abused
than
entail
so
much
misery
on
their
posterity
and
bring
ruin
upon
millions
of
unborn
persons
and
having
thus
deprived
them
of
their
agency
to
act
upon
the
earth
and
punished
them
for
their
transgressions
jesus
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison
which
sometime
were
disobedient
when
once
the
long
suffering
of
god
waited
in
the
days
of
noah
while
the
ark
was
a
preparing
peter
iii
it
is
upon
this
principle
that
the
world
will
be
punished
in
the
last
days
for
their
transgressions
because
they
have
abused
their
agency
and
broken
the
covenant
that
god
made
with
them
they
have
yielded
to
the
influence
of
satan
perverted
the
designs
of
jehovah
and
brought
upon
themselves
and
posterity
a
curse
misery
and
ruin
if
any
thing
further
is
desired
upon
this
subject
isaiah
has
described
it
plainly
and
has
shewn
the
awful
effects
of
an
abuse
of
this
moral
agency
and
departure
from
god
and
the
breaking
of
this
covenant
to
him
i
refer
the
reader
as
a
conclusion
on
this
subject
behold
the
lord
maketh
the
earth
empty
and
maketh
it
waste
and
turneth
it
upside
down
and
scattereth
abroad
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
it
shall
be
as
with
the
people
so
with
the
priest
as
with
the
servant
so
with
his
master
as
with
the
maid
so
with
her
mistress
as
with
the
buyer
so
with
the
seller
as
with
the
lender
so
with
the
borrower
as
with
the
taker
of
usury
so
with
the
giver
of
usury
to
him
the
land
shall
be
utterly
emptied
and
utterly
spoiled
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
this
word
the
earth
mourneth
and
fadeth
away
the
world
languisheth
and
fadeth
away
the
haughty
people
of
the
earth
do
languish
the
earth
also
is
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
because
they
have
transgressed
the
laws
changed
the
ordinance
broken
the
everlasting
covenant
therefore
hath
the
curse
devoured
the
earth
and
they
that
dwell
therein
are
desolate
therefore
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
are
burned
and
few
men
left
xxiv
chapter
vii
the
lord
course
in
the
moral
government
of
the
world
we
will
now
enquire
what
part
the
lord
has
ever
taken
in
the
moral
government
of
the
world
in
the
last
chapter
i
shewed
that
man
has
a
moral
agency
acting
under
the
lord
and
is
consequently
responsible
to
him
for
his
acts
as
a
moral
agent
but
does
he
leave
him
alone
and
unassisted
to
carry
out
his
designs
no
looking
upon
man
as
his
son
he
has
from
time
to
time
offered
his
services
and
instructions
as
a
father
he
has
given
revelations
instructing
and
warning
his
people
he
has
given
promises
to
the
obedient
and
threatened
the
disobedient
he
has
instructed
kings
rulers
and
prophets
he
has
also
protected
the
righteous
and
punished
by
judgments
the
wicked
he
has
promised
to
abraham
and
others
lands
and
possessions
he
has
held
out
promises
of
eternal
life
to
the
faithful
but
has
never
coerced
or
forced
the
human
mind
he
destroyed
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
world
because
they
had
corrupted
themselves
he
did
not
govern
their
minds
they
might
forget
god
and
every
thought
of
their
hearts
be
only
evil
and
that
continually
but
the
earth
was
the
lord
and
he
was
the
father
of
our
spirits
and
although
man
had
an
agency
to
propagate
his
species
it
was
given
him
by
god
and
if
he
was
so
blind
as
to
corrupt
himself
and
entail
misery
upon
millions
of
unborn
beings
the
god
of
the
universe
the
father
of
spirits
had
a
right
to
prevent
him
and
if
he
was
prostituting
the
use
of
those
faculties
given
him
by
god
to
the
service
of
satan
and
abusing
the
liberty
which
his
creator
had
so
liberally
given
although
the
lord
could
not
control
the
free
action
of
his
will
he
could
destroy
his
body
and
thus
prevent
him
from
cursing
posterity
hence
if
a
man
transgresses
the
laws
of
the
land
he
is
considered
a
bad
member
of
society
and
is
punished
accordingly
sometimes
imprisoned
sometimes
banished
and
sometimes
put
to
death
legislators
assign
as
a
reason
for
these
things
that
such
persons
are
injurious
to
society
that
if
crime
was
not
punished
the
virtuous
and
good
would
be
abused
the
wicked
would
triumph
character
life
and
property
would
be
insecure
and
anarchy
confusion
and
desolation
would
inevitably
ensue
i
would
here
ask
if
man
acts
upon
this
principle
has
not
god
a
right
to
do
so
with
the
affairs
of
his
government
or
should
we
arrogate
to
ourselves
privileges
that
we
will
not
allow
the
lord
to
possess
upon
this
principle
the
devil
and
his
angels
were
cast
out
of
heaven
the
devil
having
his
agency
as
well
as
man
came
here
and
sought
to
destroy
the
works
of
god
and
succeeded
so
far
as
to
obtain
an
influence
over
man
spirit
and
bring
his
body
into
subjection
to
his
agency
and
if
man
was
so
ungrateful
and
corrupt
as
to
yield
to
his
influence
and
obey
his
agency
god
had
as
much
right
to
punish
him
as
he
had
the
devil
and
as
he
cast
the
devil
and
his
angels
out
of
heaven
he
also
cut
man
off
from
the
earth
and
thus
punished
the
spirits
that
were
disobedient
in
the
days
of
noah
satan
in
heaven
had
no
power
over
those
spirits
but
when
they
came
to
earth
he
gained
an
ascendency
over
them
and
not
having
a
body
himself
made
use
of
their
bodies
to
corrupt
the
world
and
thus
thwart
the
designs
of
jehovah
they
must
therefore
bear
the
consequences
of
their
disobedience
and
if
i
am
asked
by
a
sceptic
why
god
destroyed
so
many
human
beings
i
answer
this
was
god
government
they
had
transgressed
his
laws
were
traitors
to
him
and
he
had
a
right
to
punish
them
as
i
before
stated
to
prevent
them
from
bringing
ruin
upon
others
and
perpetuating
this
misery
of
the
human
family
in
time
and
in
eternity
the
lord
has
given
laws
and
although
he
has
not
forced
man
to
keep
them
nor
coerced
his
will
yet
he
has
punished
him
for
disobedience
as
a
father
would
a
son
a
father
of
a
child
can
teach
that
child
correct
principles
but
unless
he
controls
or
confines
the
body
he
can
not
force
that
child
to
observe
them
he
can
punish
him
for
disobedience
however
and
thus
exert
a
moral
or
physical
influence
over
him
our
father
does
the
same
he
punished
the
inhabitants
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
babylon
ninevah
jerusalem
and
many
other
cities
and
will
punish
the
world
on
the
same
principle
again
he
has
offered
rewards
and
given
them
to
the
faithful
such
as
noah
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
he
protected
the
children
of
israel
and
blessed
them
with
temporal
and
national
prosperity
when
they
served
him
and
punished
their
enemies
and
he
would
have
extended
his
blessings
to
the
world
if
they
would
have
been
obedient
to
him
the
lord
has
used
these
influences
but
never
coerced
the
will
hence
jesus
said
to
the
jews
how
often
have
gathered
you
together
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
and
not
god
would
have
benefitted
them
but
they
would
not
be
benefited
again
the
prophet
says
because
have
and
ye
i
have
stretched
out
my
hand
and
no
man
regarded
but
ye
have
set
at
nought
all
my
counsel
and
would
none
of
my
reproof
i
also
will
laugh
at
your
calamity
i
will
mock
when
your
fear
cometh
prov
i
these
things
clearly
prove
that
man
is
a
free
moral
agent
and
that
god
never
has
controlled
the
human
mind
and
that
consequently
if
man
is
found
in
a
state
of
wretchedness
degradation
and
ruin
he
has
himself
to
blame
for
it
and
not
the
lord
the
lord
would
have
given
him
his
counsel
if
he
had
sought
it
for
he
instruct
men
of
god
formerly
and
gave
them
laws
and
ordinances
and
he
told
his
people
that
if
they
called
upon
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
he
would
hear
them
and
james
says
if
any
of
you
lack
wisdom
let
him
ask
of
god
who
giveth
to
all
men
liberally
and
upbraideth
not
and
it
shall
be
given
him
i
when
the
children
of
israel
served
god
and
obeyed
him
they
acknowledged
his
authority
and
said
the
lord
is
our
judge
the
lord
is
our
lawgiver
the
lord
is
our
king
he
will
save
us
isaiah
xxxiii
if
the
children
of
israel
had
been
obedient
and
this
principle
had
extended
over
the
earth
we
should
have
had
the
kingdom
of
god
established
on
the
earth
and
universal
peace
and
happiness
would
have
prevailed
but
man
corruption
and
degeneracy
have
destroyed
the
world
and
nothing
but
the
wisdom
power
and
blessings
of
god
can
restore
it
chapter
viii
whose
right
is
it
to
govern
the
world
who
has
governed
it
having
traced
out
in
the
preceding
chapters
the
nature
of
man
his
destiny
and
parentage
spiritual
and
temporal
what
his
object
is
in
being
here
what
his
relation
to
this
earth
is
his
moral
agency
and
shown
that
god
has
never
controlled
his
actions
we
will
next
enquire
a
little
about
the
earth
whose
right
it
is
to
govern
it
and
who
has
governed
it
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
say
a
great
deal
here
about
the
earth
and
its
organization
for
we
have
touched
on
this
subject
before
and
it
is
one
about
which
there
should
be
no
dispute
among
believers
in
the
bible
i
will
briefly
state
that
paul
says
for
by
him
were
all
things
created
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
visible
and
invisible
whether
they
be
thrones
or
dominions
or
principalities
or
powers
all
things
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
colos
i
this
being
the
case
without
further
investigation
we
will
examine
whose
right
it
is
to
govern
it
if
the
world
be
the
lord
he
certainly
has
a
right
to
govern
it
for
we
have
already
stated
that
man
has
no
authority
except
that
which
is
delegated
to
him
he
possesses
a
moral
power
to
govern
his
actions
subject
at
all
times
to
the
law
of
god
but
never
is
authorized
to
act
independent
of
god
much
less
is
he
authorised
to
rule
on
the
earth
without
the
call
and
direction
of
the
lord
therefore
any
rule
or
dominion
over
the
earth
which
is
not
given
by
the
lord
is
surreptitiously
obtained
and
never
will
be
sanctioned
by
him
i
am
aware
that
kings
and
queens
are
anointed
and
set
apart
by
their
different
ministers
according
to
the
different
forms
and
creeds
of
the
several
countries
over
which
they
reign
there
are
two
things
necessary
however
to
make
their
authority
legal
and
to
authorize
them
to
act
as
god
representatives
on
the
earth
the
first
is
that
they
should
be
called
of
god
and
the
second
that
the
persons
by
whom
they
are
anointed
are
duly
authorised
to
anoint
them
first
then
it
may
be
necessary
to
observe
that
if
kings
and
queens
are
of
god
selection
and
are
his
representatives
they
must
themselves
be
appointed
by
him
for
if
not
so
how
can
they
be
considered
his
representatives
the
prophet
hosea
complains
that
they
have
set
up
kings
but
not
by
me
they
have
made
princes
and
i
knew
it
not
viii
if
they
are
sent
by
him
they
must
understand
their
office
and
calling
and
the
designs
of
the
lord
concerning
the
people
whom
they
govern
the
same
as
a
governor
of
a
province
or
a
minister
plenipotentiary
receives
his
credentials
from
the
prince
or
court
whom
he
serves
if
then
we
examine
the
position
of
kings
and
their
relationship
to
their
divine
sovereign
we
shall
find
that
there
are
only
two
ways
for
this
calling
to
be
legal
it
must
have
been
given
either
by
god
through
revelation
to
the
ancestors
of
the
reigning
kings
and
handed
down
in
an
unbroken
descent
to
the
present
time
or
otherwise
given
by
direct
revelation
and
they
set
apart
by
a
prophet
of
the
lord
god
but
no
nation
kingdom
or
king
in
existence
will
acknowledge
either
of
these
ways
all
the
kingdoms
that
are
now
in
existence
were
founded
by
the
sword
without
any
respect
to
god
in
relation
to
their
anointing
the
question
would
naturally
arise
who
authorised
the
ministers
to
anoint
those
kings
and
queens
for
if
the
persons
officiating
have
not
the
authority
thus
to
anoint
and
set
them
apart
to
execute
god
law
and
reign
over
the
nations
their
anointing
will
avail
them
little
it
will
be
merely
the
anointing
of
man
without
the
direction
and
sanction
of
god
authority
to
anoint
kings
and
queens
in
order
that
they
may
be
the
anointed
of
the
lord
must
be
given
in
one
of
three
ways
it
must
first
have
been
given
by
revelation
to
the
primitive
christian
church
authorising
them
to
administer
in
this
ordinance
and
empowering
their
successors
to
do
it
secondly
by
direct
revelation
or
otherwise
it
must
have
been
transmitted
from
the
ancient
jews
through
a
lineal
descent
in
regard
to
the
first
we
find
no
such
record
in
the
new
testament
neither
jesus
nor
his
apostles
nor
any
of
the
seventies
nor
elders
ever
administered
in
this
ordinance
or
spoke
of
it
as
being
associated
with
the
powers
of
their
ministry
consequently
no
power
can
come
from
there
a
footnote
a
i
am
aware
that
the
roman
catholic
ministry
will
tell
us
that
they
have
traditionary
authority
to
anoint
kings
and
to
perform
many
ordinances
that
are
not
contained
in
the
scriptures
without
however
arguing
the
point
of
their
authority
here
i
would
briefly
remark
that
in
order
for
the
administration
to
be
legal
it
is
necessary
that
the
kings
themselves
be
called
of
god
that
this
call
is
requisite
as
well
as
the
anointing
and
that
if
they
possessed
all
the
power
they
claim
they
have
no
more
right
to
anoint
a
man
to
be
king
who
is
not
called
by
god
in
one
of
the
two
mentioned
ways
than
any
officer
of
state
would
be
authorised
to
confer
an
office
of
trust
or
honor
on
any
individual
the
gift
of
which
was
vested
in
the
king
alone
if
the
king
had
never
appointed
the
individual
all
intelligent
persons
must
see
that
either
appointment
is
illegal
and
consequently
null
and
void
the
following
from
a
french
history
is
interesting
and
needs
no
comment
it
shows
clearly
the
design
of

in
regard
to
the
second
position
all
christendom
deny
present
revelation
and
thus
from
their
own
confession
they
have
not
obtained
their
authority
from
that
source
and
in
regard
to
the
third
if
there
was
authority
associated
with
the
jews
to
ordain
kings
the
christians
certainly
could
not
claim
a
jewish
rite
for
the
jewish
nation
and
authority
were
all
destroyed
they
were
broken
off
because
of
unbelief
rom
xi
the
christians
obtained
all
their
authority
to
officiate
from
jesus
christ
and
not
from
the
jews
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
there
is
no
foundation
for
any
such
authority
and
consequently
the
anointing
is
all
a
farce
for
it
does
not
originate
with
god
but
here
let
us
enquire
a
little
further
does
god
set
up
christian
kings
to
fight
against
christian
kings
and
christian
subjects
to
destroy
christian
subjects
i
know
they
call
upon
god
but
what
to
do
in
their
wars
they
ask
him
to
destroy
one
another
this
patchwork
dominion
and
mongrel
christianity
although
they
may
be
quite
feasible
in
the
dark
yet
they
present
a
curious
spectacle
when
brought
into
the
light
of
truth
it
may
be
asked
has
not
the
lord
given
authority
to
kings
to
reign
yes
he
has
to
two
kinds
to
one
to
accomplish
certain
purposes
that
he
had
in
view
relative
to
the
nations
to
the
other
to
rule
over
his
people
these
were
legally
called
and
anointed
by
him
of
the
first
kind
was
nebuchadnezzar
he
had
a
kingdom
and
dominion
given
to
him
so
say
the
scriptures
but
certainly
not
to
govern
god
people
for
he
made
and
caused
to
be
worshipped
a
large
golden
image
and
put
shadrach
meschach
and
abednego
into
a
furnace
for
not
doing
so
what
then
was
his
calling
first
it
was
to
govern
a
wicked
and
idolatrous
people
and
secondly
to
fulfil
the
will
of
god
in
the
punishment
of
his
people
as
the
people
over
whom
he
ruled
had
given
themselves
up
to
idolatry
they
had
an
idolatrous
king
given
to
them
for
their
ruler
for
the
lord
never
having
given
up
his
right
to
govern
the
world
gives
the
people
kings
according
to
their
deserts
and
although
he
may
not
give
them
authority
as
his
yet
by
his
overruling
providence
he
places
wicked
men
in
a
position
that
they
may
have
power
over
a
wicked
nation
both
to
trouble
that
nation
and
themselves
such
was
the
case
with
pharaoh
king
of
egypt
and
also
with
salmanaser
king
of
assyria
when
he
defied
the
god
of
israel
such
was
the
case
with
some
of
the
kings
of
israel
in
the
rebellions
of
that
people
and
with
belshazzar
king
of
babylon
who
was
eating
and
drinking
with
his
wives
and
concubines
in
the
palace
at
babylon
when
the
handwriting
was
seen
on
the
walls
god
hath
numbered
thy
kingdom
and
finished
it
thou
art
weighed
in
the
balances
and
art
found
wanting
dan
babylon
was
destroyed
and
so
fully
have
the
purposes
of
god
been
accomplished
in
relation
to
that
magnificent
city
that
the
place
where
it
then
stood
is
now
a
desert
and
such
also
will
be
the
case
with
the
nations
and
kings
of
the
earth
in
the
last
day
as
spoken
of
by
zechariah
behold
the
day
of
the
lord
cometh
for
i
will
gather
all
nations
against
jerusalem
to
battle
then
shall
the
lord
go
forth
and
fight
against
those
nations
as
when
he
fought
in
the
day
of
battle
xiv
also
read
the
chapter
of
ezekiel
here
then
is
a
slaughter
the
most
terrible
that
could
be
conceived
the
armies
actually
cover
the
land
and
so
dreadful
is
the
slaughter
that
they
can
not
bury
the
dead
so
that
their
stench
shall
stop
the
noses
of
the
passers
by
the
fowls
of
the
air
are
commanded
also
to
assemble
that
they
may
eat
the
flesh
of
kings
captains
and
mighty
men
and
yet
those
kings
princes
and
rulers
will
by
the
providence
of
god
be
given
to
the
people
as
a
chastisement
that
the
lord
may
punish
both
kings
and
people
on
account
of
their
iniquities
daniel
clearly
exemplifies
this
subject
in
the
following
words
in
speaking
of
the
judgements
that
should
come
upon
nebuchadnezzar
he
states
that
these
judgements
were
to
the
intent
that
the
living
may
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
and
setteth
up
over
it
the
basest
of
men
iv
another
duty
that
wicked
kings
have
to
perform
on
the
earth
is
that
of
being
used
by
the
almighty
as
a
scourge
or
rod
to
punish
nations
that
are
corrupt
hence
when
israel
had
sinned
against
god
and
the
lord
determined
to
chastise
them
he
told
them
through
his
prophets
that
he
would
punish
them
by
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
accordingly
nebuchadnezzar
came
against
jerusalem
and
took
the
children
of
israel
captive
to
babylon
with
the
vessels
of
silver
and
gold
belonging
to
the
temple
and
god
afterwards
punished
babylon
for
its
transgressions
cyrus
king
of
persia
was
raised
up
by
the
lord
to
chastise
it
but
did
either
of
these
kings
govern
god
people
or
were
they
ordained
by
the
lord
no
only
as
his
sword
to
execute
his
judgements
on
the
nations
such
also
were
alexander
caesar
and
others
and
hence
paul
tells
the
christians
in
his
day
to
submit
themselves
to
kings
and
rulers
and
why
these
men
were
ordained
for
a
certain
purpose
and
it
was
not
for
the
christians
to
set
in
order
the
affairs
of
god
kingdom
nor
to
regulate
the
world
the
lord
would
do
that
in
his
own
time
and
way
it
was
for
them
to
wait
for
the
time
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
another
order
of
kings
were
those
that
were
anointed
to
reign
over
god
people
the
children
of
israel
such
was
saul
who
was
anointed
by
samuel
such
also
were
david
and
solomon
and
many
of
the
kings
of
israel
those
kings
that
were
anointed
and
acknowledged
of
the
lord
were
not
only
kings
but
priests
hence
saul
when
he
had
sinned
against
god
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
withdrawn
enquired
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
answered
him
not
neither
by
dreams
nor
by
urim
nor
by
prophets
sam
xxviii
david
also
acted
as
a
priest
and
could
obtain
knowledge
or
revelation
from
god
also
for
when
saul
was
rejected
and
sought
david
life
david
called
for
the
ephod
used
by
the
priests
see
exodus
xxviii
and
david
said
to
abiathar
the
priest
bring
hither
the
ephod
then
said
david
o
lord
god
of
israel
thy
servant
hath
certainly
heard
that
saul
seeketh
to
come
to
keilah
to
destroy
the
city
for
my
sake
will
the
men
of
keilah
deliver
me
up
into
his
hand
will
saul
come
down
as
thy
servant
hath
heard
o
lord
god
of
israel
i
beseech
thee
tell
thy
servant
and
the
lord
said
he
will
come
down
then
said
david
will
the
men
of
keilah
deliver
me
and
my
men
up
into
the
hand
of
saul
and
the
lord
said
they
will
deliver
thee
up
sam
xxiii
here
we
find
david
actually
enquiring
of
god
for
direction
and
obtaining
information
the
lord
had
forsaken
saul
and
would
not
answer
him
but
he
would
and
did
answer
david
see
also
the
xxiii
and
xxx
and
sam
ii
xxi
chron
xiv
from
the
whole
of
the
above
we
learn
that
david
took
no
step
without
enquiring
of
the
lord
solomon
also
acted
as
a
priest
as
well
as
a
king
and
it
is
said
of
him
that
solomon
loved
the
lord
walking
in
the
statutes
of
david
his
father
and
the
lord
gave
him
wisdom
and
instructed
him
in
the
affairs
of
his
kingdom
when
he
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
asked
of
him
wisdom
god
granted
him
the
desire
of
his
heart
and
gave
him
with
wisdom
riches
and
honor
and
judah
and
israel
dwelt
in
safety
every
man
under
his
vine
and
fig
tree
from
dan
to
beersheba
all
the
days
of
solomon
and
when
he
had
finished
the
temple
he
offered
his
sacrifices
and
acknowledged
the
god
of
israel
and
he
prayed
for
the
nation
over
which
he
ruled
not
by
proxy
but
himself
and
solomon
stood
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
in
the
presence
of
all
the
congregation
of
israel
and
spread
forth
his
hands
towards
heaven
and
then
he
uttered
a
prayer
for
himself
his
people
and
nation
see
kings
viii
and
we
read
that
afterwards
the
lord
appeared
to
him
and
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
and
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me
as
david
thy
father
walked
in
integrity
of
heart
and
in
uprightness
to
do
according
to
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
and
wilt
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgements
then
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
ever
as
i
promised
to
david
thy
father
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
upon
the
throne
of
israel
but
if
ye
shall
at
all
turn
from
following
me
ye
or
your
children
and
will
not
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
which
i
have
set
before
you
but
go
and
serve
other
gods
and
worship
them
then
will
i
cut
off
israel
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
i
have
hallowed
for
my
name
will
i
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
israel
shall
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
people
and
at
this
house
which
is
high
every
one
that
passeth
by
it
shall
be
astonished
and
shall
hiss
and
they
shall
say
why
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
and
to
this
house
and
they
shall
answer
because
they
forsook
the
lord
their
god
who
brought
forth
their
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
have
taken
hold
upon
other
gods
and
have
worshipped
them
and
served
them
therefore
hath
the
lord
brought
upon
them
all
this
evil
kings
ix
thus
then
these
men
delegated
and
appointed
of
god
acted
as
his
representatives
on
the
earth
they
received
their
kingdoms
from
him
they
were
anointed
by
prophets
of
god
who
received
the
word
of
the
lord
concerning
them
as
in
the
case
of
saul
and
david
and
if
they
departed
from
god
he
chastised
or
removed
them
as
in
the
case
of
saul
and
david
and
of
which
the
history
of
the
kings
of
israel
is
a
striking
example
and
faithful
commentary
those
that
were
faithful
among
them
sought
to
know
the
mind
of
god
and
to
carry
out
his
designs
the
greatest
most
powerful
and
prosperous
rule
that
ever
existed
among
them
as
a
nation
was
that
of
solomon
who
asked
and
obtained
wisdom
from
god
and
that
wisdom
as
a
necessary
consequence
brought
honour
happiness
security
riches
magnificence
and
power
thus
those
kings
that
were
righteous
who
received
their
kingdoms
from
the
lord
went
to
war
or
proclaimed
peace
by
his
directions
they
were
his
representatives
on
the
earth
and
governed
his
people
as
the
lord
anointed
yet
even
the
monarchy
of
the
house
of
israel
was
not
in
strict
accordance
with
the
will
of
god
but
originated
in
the
rebellion
and
pride
of
the
children
of
israel
who
wishing
to
be
like
the
nations
around
them
being
dissatisfied
with
their
judges
desired
of
the
lord
a
king
the
following
are
their
words
and
the
answer
then
all
the
elders
of
israel
gathered
themselves
together
and
came
to
samuel
unto
ramah
and
said
unto
him
behold
thou
art
old
and
thy
sons
walk
not
in
thy
ways
now
make
us
a
king
to
judge
us
like
all
the
nations
but
the
thing
displeased
samuel
when
they
said
give
us
a
king
to
judge
us
and
samuel
prayed
unto
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
unto
samuel
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
people
in
all
that
they
say
unto
thee
for
they
have
not
rejected
thee
but
they
have
rejected
me
that
i
should
not
reign
over
them
according
to
all
the
works
which
they
have
done
since
the
day
that
i
brought
them
up
out
of
egypt
even
unto
this
day
wherewith
they
have
forsaken
me
and
served
other
gods
so
do
they
also
unto
thee
now
therefore
hearken
unto
their
voice
howbeit
yet
protest
solemnly
unto
them
and
shew
them
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
them
and
samuel
told
all
the
words
of
the
lord
unto
the
people
that
asked
of
him
a
king
and
he
said
this
will
be
the
manner
of
the
king
that
shall
reign
over
you
he
will
take
your
sons
and
appoint
them
for
himself
for
his
chariots
and
to
be
his
horsemen
and
some
shall
run
before
his
chariots
and
he
will
appoint
him
captains
over
thousands
and
captains
over
fifties
and
will
set
them
to
ear
his
ground
and
to
reap
his
harvest
and
to
make
his
instruments
of
war
and
instruments
of
his
chariots
and
he
will
take
your
daughters
to
be
confectionaries
and
to
be
cooks
and
to
be
bakers
and
he
will
take
your
fields
and
your
vineyards
and
your
oliveyards
even
the
best
of
them
and
give
them
to
his
servants
and
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
seed
and
of
your
vineyards
and
give
to
his
officers
and
to
his
servants
and
he
will
take
your
menservants
and
your
maidservants
and
your
goodliest
young
men
and
your
asses
and
put
them
to
his
work
he
will
take
the
tenth
of
your
sheep
and
ye
shall
be
his
servants
and
ye
shall
cry
out
in
that
day
because
of
your
king
which
ye
shall
have
chosen
you
and
the
lord
will
not
hear
you
in
that
day
nevertheless
the
people
refused
to
obey
the
voice
of
samuel
and
they
said
nay
but
we
will
have
a
king
over
us
that
we
also
may
be
like
all
the
nations
and
that
our
king
may
judge
us
and
go
out
before
us
and
fight
our
battles
and
samuel
heard
all
the
words
of
the
people
and
he
rehearsed
them
in
the
ears
of
the
lord
and
the
lord
said
to
samuel
hearken
unto
their
voice
and
make
them
a
king
and
samuel
said
unto
the
men
of
israel
go
ye
every
man
unto
his
city
sam
viii
we
find
that
this
thing
was
displeasing
to
the
lord
they
resisted
the
counsel
of
god
but
as
they
were
the
lord
people
he
listened
to
their
requests
and
gave
according
to
their
desires
he
felt
bound
to
fulfil
his
engagements
and
if
they
would
not
walk
fully
by
the
rule
that
he
required
to
give
a
government
of
their
own
asking
which
if
not
so
good
as
the
one
he
proposed
was
nevertheless
sanctioned
by
him
and
that
order
once
established
those
kings
set
apart
and
anointed
by
him
had
a
perfect
right
to
look
to
him
for
his
guidance
which
they
did
and
inasmuch
as
they
performed
his
will
as
his
representatives
were
blessed
of
him
for
kings
could
not
be
blamed
for
the
order
that
existed
they
did
not
originate
the
government
it
was
the
people
all
they
could
do
was
to
rule
according
to
the
direction
of
the
lord
but
this
was
not
a
perfect
government
the
lord
had
his
eye
on
something
yet
more
glorious
something
in
which
the
salvation
and
happiness
of
the
world
were
concerned
a
rule
of
righteousness
when
not
only
one
nation
but
the
kingdoms
and
dominions
of
the
whole
earth
should
be
given
to
the
son
of
god
and
when
all
nations
kindreds
people
and
tongues
should
serve
and
obey
him
and
as
the
earth
belonged
to
him
and
the
people
also
that
he
should
govern
them
such
will
be
the
case
as
we
shall
hereafter
show
and
a
system
be
introduced
that
will
not
only
benefit
one
nation
but
that
will
govern
all
nations
bless
the
whole
of
the
human
family
and
exalt
and
happify
the
world
all
these
things
that
have
existed
are
merely
temporary
arrangements
adapted
to
the
weakness
ignorance
and
wickedness
of
the
human
family
in
the
times
of
darkness
and
power
of
satan
if
the
above
is
the
case
in
regard
to
the
best
of
these
governments
even
that
of
the
house
of
israel
what
is
the
situation
of
those
who
are
governing
without
even
any
pretensions
to
have
received
their
government
and
authority
from
god
it
may
be
asked
what
is
to
be
done
in
this
state
of
things
how
are
they
to
be
regulated
this
is
worthy
of
our
attention
but
as
we
shall
devote
some
time
to
this
hereafter
we
will
content
ourselves
with
saying
this
is
god
work
and
not
man
he
has
these
things
in
his
hands
and
he
must
arrange
them
confusion
revolt
rebellion
is
not
the
way
to
bring
these
things
about
for
if
the
world
is
already
evil
this
will
only
make
it
worse
besides
the
kings
and
rulers
of
the
present
day
are
no
more
responsible
than
others
they
did
not
make
the
nations
as
they
are
they
found
them
so
neither
are
they
appointed
to
govern
the
world
nor
do
any
of
them
profess
it
according
to
their
most
extended
calculation
their
power
would
be
confined
to
their
own
nations
some
of
the
kings
and
queens
of
the
earth
seem
to
be
actuated
by
a
desire
to
promote
the
happiness
of
the
nations
with
which
they
are
associated
and
over
which
they
rule
the
queen
of
england
is
almost
universally
beloved
by
her
subjects
and
that
deservedly
she
has
been
mild
and
pacific
in
her
course
and
her
rule
and
dominion
have
been
as
near
right
as
it
is
possible
for
a
government
to
be
under
existing
circumstances
if
there
are
evils
she
did
not
originate
them
she
found
them
so
she
has
kept
her
covenant
that
she
made
with
the
nation
and
sought
the
welfare
of
her
subjects
and
they
owe
her
fealty
and
ought
to
render
to
her
obedience
and
as
she
nor
no
monarch
is
set
to
build
up
the
kingdom
of
god
or
establish
universal
rule
as
a
monarchy
without
authority
from
god
it
is
perhaps
as
good
a
form
as
could
exist
the
emperor
of
russia
with
all
his
faults
of
government
nevertheless
possesses
many
good
traits
at
any
rate
he
seems
to
reverence
the
lord
some
time
ago
when
the
cholera
broke
out
in
petersburgh
the
inhabitants
supposed
that
their
wells
had
been
poisoned
a
large
number
of
people
assembled
for
the
purpose
as
they
thought
of
finding
out
and
punishing
the
aggressors
the
excitement
was
very
great
the
emperor
hearing
of
the
tumult
rushed
into
their
midst
and
said
my
children
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
that
the
wells
have
been
poisoned
and
this
is
the
cause
of
our
affliction
this
is
a
judgement
that
has
come
from
god
let
us
fall
down
before
him
and
ask
him
to
remove
his
scourge
from
our
midst
whereupon
he
fell
upon
his
knees
in
the
midst
of
the
people
and
prayed
to
the
lord
to
remove
the
plague
from
among
them
he
has
a
strong
impression
that
god
has
a
work
for
him
to
do
on
the
earth
and
in
this
he
may
be
right
although
he
is
not
delegated
to
establish
the
kingdom
of
god
he
may
nevertheless
be
appointed
as
caesar
nebuchadnezzar
and
others
as
a
scourge
to
the
nations
and
so
fulfil
his
destiny
for
as
we
are
on
the
eve
of
great
events
and
a
fearful
doom
awaits
the
nations
some
powerful
means
must
be
made
use
of
in
this
as
well
as
in
other
ages
to
bring
these
things
about
some
may
remark
on
the
foregoing
does
not
paul
say
that
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
yes
and
so
say
i
but
all
powers
that
are
ordained
of
god
do
not
rule
for
his
glory
nor
are
they
all
associated
with
his
government
and
kingdom
nebuchadnezzar
and
belshazzar
were
ordained
of
god
but
they
were
both
idolaters
cyrus
was
ordained
of
god
but
he
was
an
heathen
god
regulates
his
own
affairs
and
while
the
world
is
in
a
state
of
idolatry
apostacy
and
rebellion
he
by
his
providence
overrules
the
affairs
of
the
nation
as
daniel
says
to
the
intent
that
the
living
may
know
that
the
most
high
ruleth
in
the
kingdom
of
men
and
giveth
it
to
whomsoever
he
will
and
setteth
up
over
it
the
basest
of
men
dan
iv
but
others
will
say
that
paul
tells
us
to
be
subject
to
the
powers
that
be
so
say
i
god
will
establish
his
own
government
the
cavillings
rebellions
and
contentions
of
men
will
not
do
it
and
it
is
proper
for
well
disposed
persons
to
wait
the
lord
time
to
be
peaceable
and
quiet
and
to
pray
for
kings
governors
and
authorities
this
was
what
jeremiah
taught
the
children
of
israel
to
do
and
seek
the
peace
of
the
city
wherein
i
have
caused
you
to
be
carried
away
captives
and
pray
unto
the
lord
for
it
for
in
the
peace
thereof
shall
you
have
peace
xxix
it
is
very
evident
from
what
has
been
shown
that
there
is
no
proper
government
nor
rule
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
that
there
are
no
kings
who
are
anointed
or
legally
appointed
of
god
and
that
however
much
disposed
any
of
them
may
feel
to
benefit
the
world
it
is
out
of
their
power
it
exceeds
the
limits
of
their
jurisdiction
it
requires
a
power
spirit
and
intelligence
which
they
do
not
possess
we
see
moreover
that
tumults
commotions
rebellions
and
resistance
are
not
the
way
to
do
it
it
requires
more
wisdom
than
that
which
emperors
kings
princes
or
the
wisest
of
men
possess
to
bring
out
of
the
wild
chaos
the
misery
and
desolation
that
have
overspread
the
world
that
beautiful
order
peace
and
happiness
portrayed
by
the
prophets
as
the
reign
of
the
kingdom
of
god
chapter
ix
will
man
always
be
permitted
to
usurp
authority
over
men
and
over
the
works
of
god
will
the
world
remain
for
ever
under
a
curse
and
designs
be
frustrated
the
above
are
grave
questions
and
will
necessarily
require
examination
for
they
concern
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
their
true
solution
will
affect
man
in
time
and
in
eternity
the
world
can
not
remain
as
it
is
for
the
following
reasons
first
it
would
be
unreasonable
secondly
it
would
be
unjust
thirdly
it
would
be
unscriptural
fourthly
it
would
frustrate
the
designs
of
god
in
regard
to
the
spirits
of
the
righteous
the
dead
the
progression
of
the
world
and
its
final
exaltation
and
also
the
exaltation
of
man
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
man
to
continue
his
usurped
authority
if
god
is
interested
in
the
welfare
of
his
creatures
he
certainly
never
would
permit
without
some
just
cause
the
destruction
of
his
works
and
the
misery
of
his
creatures
and
we
have
fully
demonstrated
that
the
world
is
full
of
abominations
and
evils
and
that
those
evils
can
only
be
removed
by
the
interposition
of
the
lord
that
the
assumed
authority
of
men
and
the
devil
can
only
be
checked
by
a
superior
power
god
holds
that
power
in
his
hands
he
holds
the
life
of
the
human
family
in
his
hands
and
the
world
notwithstanding
its
rebellion
and
iniquity
has
to
be
sustained
by
him
from
day
to
day
let
him
but
withdraw
his
governing
and
controlling
power
from
the
earth
and
it
would
wander
wildly
through
space
unblest
by
the
genial
influences
of
the
sun
or
clash
against
some
other
system
involving
all
creation
in
ruin
let
some
slight
variation
take
place
in
its
diurnal
motion
and
the
sea
would
leave
its
proper
bounds
overflow
the
earth
and
millions
of
the
human
family
would
perish
let
even
some
slight
variation
take
place
in
the
atmosphere
and
the
lord
withdraw
the
sanitory
influences
that
preserve
the
earth
in
its
present
healthy
state
and
the
murky
atmosphere
would
contain
contagion
and
disease
the
pestiferous
air
would
spread
desolation
and
death
plague
and
pestilence
would
fill
the
earth
and
millions
of
foetid
loathsome
beings
would
be
living
and
dying
examples
of
man
impotency
and
weakness
even
a
small
insect
sent
to
destroy
the
grain
accompanied
with
the
blight
of
the
potatoes
such
as
has
already
been
witnessed
would
produce
incalculable
evil
let
these
things
become
more
universal
and
the
death
of
the
human
family
must
ensue
even
so
slight
a
thing
as
too
much
or
too
little
rain
would
produce
uncalculated
misery
when
we
contemplate
man
as
he
is
a
poor
worm
dependent
upon
god
for
his
daily
bread
and
upon
how
many
slight
contingencies
the
brittle
thread
of
life
is
continued
and
that
the
least
variation
in
the
economy
of
god
might
in
numberless
ways
involve
the
human
family
in
ruin
and
then
notice
his
arrogance
pride
conceit
and
rebellion
it
seems
to
us
mysterious
that
the
mercy
of
god
should
be
so
long
extended
to
him
and
we
can
only
account
for
it
upon
this
principle
that
god
is
too
great
wise
powerful
and
magnanimous
to
be
moved
to
anger
by
the
impotent
ravings
the
empty
pride
the
little
meanness
the
swelling
pusillanimity
and
the
utter
helplessness
of
the
erratic
puerile
insignificant
creature
man
he
lets
him
wallow
in
his
corruptions
gloat
in
his
misery
and
permits
him
to
become
a
prey
to
satan
for
a
season
that
he
may
feel
the
greatness
of
his
fall
the
extent
of
his
degeneracy
and
the
utter
ruin
that
his
own
course
instigated
by
the
powers
of
the
adversary
has
brought
upon
him
that
he
may
afterwards
learn
to
appreciate
the
mercies
of
god
see
and
understand
the
delusion
and
be
enabled
eternally
to
appreciate
the
mercies
and
government
of
god
after
having
first
atoned
for
his
own
acts
and
transgressions
for
like
a
wayward
and
disobedient
child
he
will
be
glad
to
return
to
his
father
house
and
friendship
and
when
the
vision
of
his
mind
shall
be
opened
which
if
not
done
in
this
world
will
be
in
the
world
to
come
he
will
be
thoroughly
disgusted
with
himself
and
his
acts
and
will
be
glad
on
any
conditions
to
find
an
asylum
with
his
father
this
state
of
things
then
is
merely
permitted
for
a
season
to
develop
the
designs
and
influences
of
satan
and
their
effects
to
develop
the
weakness
of
man
and
his
incompetency
to
rule
and
govern
himself
without
god
to
manifest
the
mercy
of
god
in
bearing
with
man
in
the
midst
of
his
rebellion
to
show
man
his
ingratitude
and
the
depth
of
his
depravity
in
order
that
he
may
appreciate
more
fully
the
mercy
and
of
god
and
the
purity
and
holiness
that
reign
in
the
eternal
world
man
has
tasted
the
misery
of
sin
and
rebellion
and
drunk
of
the
cup
of
sorrow
in
order
that
he
may
appreciate
more
fully
the
joy
and
happiness
that
spring
from
obedience
to
god
and
his
laws
but
to
think
for
a
moment
that
man
here
will
always
be
permitted
to
subvert
the
designs
of
god
and
the
world
be
for
ever
under
the
dominion
of
satan
is
the
height
of
folly
and
only
develops
more
fully
the
pride
littleness
and
emptiness
of
man
for
notwithstanding
man
is
a
weak
creature
in
comparison
to
god
yet
he
has
within
him
the
germs
of
greatness
and
immortality
god
is
his
father
and
though
now
wandering
in
darkness
sunk
degraded
and
fallen
he
is
destined
in
the
purposes
of
god
to
be
great
dignified
and
exalted
to
occupy
a
glorious
position
in
the
eternal
world
and
to
fulfil
the
object
of
his
creation
will
this
design
be
frustrated
by
the
powers
of
darkness
or
the
influence
of
wicked
and
ungodly
men
verily
no
to
suppose
such
a
thing
manifests
the
greatest
absurdity
which
can
only
be
equalled
by
the
weakness
and
ignorance
from
whence
it
springs
what
god
the
author
of
the
universe
and
of
all
created
good
suffer
his
plans
to
be
frustrated
by
the
powers
of
the
devil
shall
this
beautiful
world
and
all
its
inhabitants
become
a
prey
to
satan
and
his
influences
and
those
celestial
pure
principles
that
exist
in
the
eternal
world
be
for
ever
banished
shall
the
earth
still
be
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
when
god
is
our
father
shall
iniquity
corruption
and
depravity
always
spread
their
contaminating
influences
and
this
earth
that
ought
to
have
been
a
paradise
be
a
desolate
miserable
wreck
shall
tyranny
oppression
and
iniquity
for
ever
rule
shall
the
neck
of
the
righteous
always
be
under
the
feet
of
the
ungodly
no
says
every
principle
of
reason
for
the
almighty
god
is
its
maker
no
echoes
the
voice
of
all
the
prophets
there
shall
be
a
restitution
of
all
things
no
say
the
scriptures
of
all
truth
the
earth
shall
become
as
the
garden
of
eden
the
wicked
shall
be
rooted
out
of
it
the
time
shall
come
when
the
saints
shall
possess
the
kingdom
and
the
earth
shall
become
as
the
garden
of
the
lord
no
responds
the
voice
of
all
the
dead
saints
we
died
in
the
hope
of
better
things
etc
no
say
our
later
revelations
the
lord
hath
brought
again
zion
the
lord
hath
redeemed
his
people
israel
according
to
the
election
of
grace
which
was
brought
to
pass
by
the
faith
and
covenants
of
their
fathers
the
lord
hath
redeemed
his
people
and
satan
is
bound
and
time
is
no
longer
the
lord
hath
gathered
all
things
in
one
the
lord
hath
brought
down
zion
from
above
the
lord
hath
brought
up
zion
from
beneath
the
earth
hath
travailed
and
brought
forth
her
strength
and
truth
is
established
in
her
bowels
and
the
heavens
have
smiled
upon
her
and
she
is
clothed
with
the
glory
of
her
god
for
he
stands
in
the
midst
of
his
people
glory
and
honor
and
power
and
might
be
ascribed
to
our
god
for
he
is
full
of
mercy
justice
grace
and
truth
and
peace
for
ever
and
ever
amen
a
footnote
a
doctrine
and
covenants
section
it
is
therefore
contrary
to
every
principle
of
reason
and
intelligence
to
suppose
such
a
thing
it
would
be
unjust
and
shall
not
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
do
right
but
what
right
would
there
be
in
thus
permitting
satan
to
usurp
the
dominion
for
ever
it
would
be
giving
in
the
first
place
to
satan
that
which
belongs
to
god
this
earth
is
not
inheritance
it
is
the
lord
jesus
christ
he
is
the
rightful
owner
and
proprietor
if
satan
be
indeed
the
god
of
this
world
and
rules
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
disobedience
he
is
only
an
usurper
it
is
not
his
rightful
dominion
for
all
things
were
created
by
christ
and
for
christ
whether
they
be
principalities
or
powers
or
thrones
or
dominions
all
these
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
and
he
only
has
a
right
to
rule
but
satan
has
subverted
the
ways
of
god
deceived
the
human
family
introduced
misery
and
confusion
and
blighted
this
beautiful
creation
with
his
contaminating
curse
as
an
usurper
it
would
be
unjust
to
permit
him
to
rule
it
would
be
unjust
to
the
government
of
god
for
if
god
has
a
right
to
rule
no
other
power
can
have
that
right
unless
it
is
delegated
and
if
delegated
still
the
right
is
vested
in
the
power
that
delegates
it
is
therefore
derogatory
to
god
for
the
world
to
be
yielding
obedience
to
another
power
for
while
god
not
the
devil
provides
for
feeds
sustains
and
beautifies
the
universe
and
nourishes
the
millions
of
people
who
inhabit
the
earth
with
his
beneficent
hand
and
fatherly
care
for
him
to
be
neglected
and
despised
or
forgotten
is
the
height
of
injustice
and
the
very
climax
of
perverse
ingratitude
but
again
it
would
be
unjust
to
the
good
and
virtuous
this
earth
is
properly
the
dwelling
place
and
rightful
inheritance
of
the
saints
inasmuch
as
it
belongs
to
jesus
christ
it
also
belongs
to
his
servants
and
followers
for
we
are
told
the
earth
is
the
lord
and
the
fulness
thereof
and
that
when
things
are
in
their
proper
place
the
saints
of
the
most
high
shall
take
the
kingdom
and
possess
the
kingdom
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heaven
shall
be
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
high
dan
vii
and
it
is
therefore
their
righful
inheritance
and
the
usurpation
before
referred
to
while
it
is
unjust
to
god
is
also
as
unjust
to
his
saints
who
can
contemplate
the
position
of
the
world
as
it
has
existed
without
being
struck
with
this
fact
where
has
god
ever
had
a
people
but
they
have
been
persecuted
the
testimony
of
god
has
always
been
rejected
and
his
people
trodden
under
foot
paul
tells
us
that
they
were
tempted
tried
sawn
asunder
that
they
wandered
about
in
sheep
skins
and
goat
skins
being
destitute
afflicted
and
tormented
heb
xi
and
to
such
an
extent
had
this
prevailed
among
the
ancient
jews
that
stephen
gravely
asks
the
question
which
of
the
prophets
have
not
your
fathers
persecuted
and
they
have
slain
them
which
shewed
before
of
the
coming
of
the
just
one
of
whom
ye
have
been
now
the
betrayers
and
murderers
acts
vii
what
did
they
do
with
jesus
and
what
with
his
followers
we
may
here
ask
is
it
right
is
it
proper
is
it
just
for
this
state
of
things
to
continue
it
is
true
that
the
saints
have
had
a
hope
of
joys
to
come
and
this
state
of
trial
has
been
permitted
for
their
ultimate
good
but
although
this
is
the
case
it
does
not
make
the
thing
the
more
just
it
must
needs
be
says
jesus
that
offences
come
but
woe
to
that
man
by
whom
the
offence
cometh
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
were
hanged
about
his
neck
and
that
he
were
drowned
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
than
that
he
should
offend
one
of
those
little
ones
matt
xviii
they
that
touch
you
touch
the
apple
of
mine
eye
he
has
cried
all
along
touch
not
mine
anointed
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm
the
saints
have
suffered
and
endured
but
they
have
done
it
in
the
hopes
of
a
better
resurrection
and
as
they
have
always
looked
upon
this
earth
as
their
inheritance
to
deprive
them
of
this
would
be
to
falsify
the
promises
of
god
unto
them
disappoint
all
their
hopes
render
inutile
their
sufferings
and
fidelity
on
the
earth
and
be
to
them
an
act
not
only
of
temporary
but
also
of
eternal
injustice
for
men
of
god
in
former
days
were
just
as
much
actuated
by
the
prospect
of
a
reward
as
a
merchant
a
warrior
a
statesman
or
any
other
person
in
search
of
wealth
honor
or
fame
the
only
difference
is
the
one
sought
it
in
this
life
the
other
in
the
life
to
come
the
one
looked
for
his
reward
here
the
other
expected
it
hereafter
the
one
had
no
hope
concerning
the
future
the
other
had
the
one
was
blinded
by
the
god
of
this
world
and
knew
not
his
position
or
possessed
not
a
nobility
of
soul
sufficient
to
make
him
brook
the
world
and
the
scorn
of
men
in
search
of
a
better
inheritance
the
other
understood
by
revelation
his
relationship
to
god
the
position
of
the
world
and
his
high
calling
and
glorious
hope
he
sought
the
nearest
way
to
eternal
life
scorned
to
be
captivated
by
the
world
tinsel
show
despised
the
pleasures
offered
by
the
god
of
this
world
and
possessed
magnanimity
of
soul
sufficient
to
lead
him
to
acknowledge
the
god
of
the
universe
and
to
brook
the
scorn
of
empty
fools
and
ephemeral
philosophers
if
persecution
deadly
shafts
and
superstition
craven
hate
were
levelled
against
him
he
dared
to
brook
death
in
all
its
horrid
forms
and
live
and
die
an
honourable
man
a
true
philosopher
a
servant
of
god
and
endure
as
seeing
him
who
is
invisible
in
the
hopes
of
a
better
resurrection
deprive
him
of
this
hope
and
you
rob
the
just
of
his
reward
dishonour
god
and
perpetuate
misery
and
corruption
in
the
world
as
it
would
be
unjust
so
also
it
would
be
unscriptural
the
scriptures
are
full
and
clear
on
this
subject
they
represent
christ
as
being
the
rightful
heir
and
inheritor
of
this
world
they
represent
him
as
having
come
once
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
but
that
he
will
afterwards
come
as
its
ruler
judge
and
king
they
represent
him
as
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
the
rightful
heir
to
the
earth
and
as
having
hitherto
been
dispossessed
but
they
again
represent
him
as
coming
to
claim
his
rights
to
dispossess
the
usurpers
to
take
the
authority
to
rule
and
reign
and
to
possess
his
own
dominions
they
represent
the
earth
as
labouring
under
a
curse
but
speak
also
of
its
deliverance
therefrom
of
its
being
blighted
because
of
the
transgression
of
man
but
that
it
shall
again
yield
its
increase
and
become
as
the
garden
of
eden
they
represent
the
whole
creation
as
groaning
and
travailing
in
pain
but
that
the
creature
also
shall
be
delivered
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
all
flesh
that
the
wolf
shall
lie
down
with
the
lamb
the
lion
eat
straw
with
the
ox
and
finally
every
creature
that
is
in
the
heavens
on
the
earth
or
under
the
earth
shall
be
heard
to
say
glory
and
honor
and
power
etc
that
the
law
shall
go
forth
from
zion
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
that
jerusalem
shall
become
the
throne
of
the
lord
and
that
the
dead
saints
shall
live
and
reign
with
christ
no
longer
deprived
of
their
rightful
inheritance
but
as
jesus
said
when
here
blessed
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
if
then
the
scriptures
are
not
idle
phantoms
if
their
visions
and
prophecies
were
not
mere
phantasies
and
written
to
deceive
we
have
as
much
right
to
look
for
these
things
as
we
have
to
believe
in
any
event
that
has
taken
place
but
lest
any
of
my
readers
should
be
ignorant
of
the
scriptures
relative
to
these
subjects
i
will
give
a
few
passages
which
are
in
themselves
as
clear
and
pointed
as
any
other
portion
of
the
word
of
god
concerning
christ
being
the
rightful
heir
it
is
written
all
things
were
created
by
him
and
for
him
and
without
him
was
not
anything
made
that
is
made
he
is
the
mighty
god
the
everlasting
father
for
of
him
and
from
him
and
to
him
are
all
things
thou
sayest
that
i
am
a
king
for
this
end
was
i
born
etc
then
the
lord
shall
be
king
over
all
the
earth
the
jews
made
a
great
mistake
concerning
the
coming
of
christ
before
the
gentiles
have
made
as
great
a
mistake
in
regard
to
his
second
coming
the
jews
expected
him
to
come
as
a
temporal
deliverer
alone
and
overlooked
his
sufferings
trials
persecution
and
death
the
gentiles
having
believed
in
his
sufferings
have
lost
sight
of
his
second
coming
the
promises
of
god
made
to
the
fathers
the
redemption
of
the
earth
and
the
kingdom
of
god
both
are
wrong
both
believed
in
part
neither
in
the
whole
the
jews
in
consequence
of
their
unbelief
were
cut
off
but
when
christ
comes
again
he
will
come
in
the
way
that
their
fathers
looked
for
him
as
a
king
with
power
and
authority
the
gentiles
having
fallen
into
darkness
have
lost
sight
of
the
great
purposes
of
god
in
regard
to
the
redemption
of
man
and
of
the
world
the
restitution
of
all
things
and
the
coming
of
christ
to
reign
they
have
so
far
forgotten
themselves
that
they
are
actually
fulfilling
the
prophecy
of
peter
there
shall
come
in
the
last
days
scoffers
walking
after
their
own
lusts
and
saying
where
is
the
promise
of
his
coming
iii
but
to
return
the
scriptures
represent
christ
as
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
as
the
heir
that
was
killed
as
the
sower
of
the
seed
in
the
world
as
the
destroyer
of
the
wicked
husbandmen
as
coming
to
rule
the
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
etc
and
to
take
possession
of
the
kingdom
daniel
says
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
one
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
and
there
was
given
him
dominion
and
glory
and
a
kingdom
that
all
people
nations
and
languages
should
serve
him
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
which
shall
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
dan

zechariah
says
and
his
feet
shall
stand
in
that
day
upon
the
mount
of
olives
which
is
before
jerusalem
on
the
east
and
the
mount
of
olives
shall
cleave
in
the
midst
thereof
toward
the
east
and
toward
the
west
and
there
shall
be
a
very
great
valley
and
half
of
the
mountain
shall
remove
toward
the
north
and
half
of
it
toward
the
south
and
ye
shall
flee
to
the
valley
of
the
mountains
for
the
valley
of
the
mountains
shall
reach
unto
azal
yea
ye
shall
flee
like
as
ye
fled
from
before
the
earthquake
in
the
days
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
and
the
lord
my
god
shall
come
and
all
the
saints
with
thee
and
the
lord
shall
be
king
over
all
the
earth
in
that
day
shall
there
be
one
lord
and
his
name
one
xiv
these
and
many
other
things
must
be
fulfilled
if
the
scriptures
be
true
these
designs
of
god
which
were
the
hope
of
the
ancient
saints
and
of
which
poets
sung
and
prophets
wrote
were
the
consolation
of
all
the
faithful
saints
prophets
and
patriarchs
jews
and
christians
take
these
away
and
the
world
to
the
saints
is
a
miserable
blank
the
hope
of
the
righteous
futile
and
the
word
of
god
a
farce
it
would
frustrate
the
designs
of
god
in
regard
to
the
spirits
of
the
righteous
the
dead
the
progression
of
the
world
and
its
final
exaltation
and
also
the
exaltation
of
man
when
the
lord
created
this
world
as
we
have
already
stated
he
had
an
object
in
view
not
only
in
regard
to
the
world
and
its
future
destiny
but
also
as
it
regards
the
spirits
which
were
then
in
existence
those
great
and
eternal
purposes
which
our
heavenly
father
in
his
consummate
wisdom
had
in
view
when
he
issued
his
divine
mandate
and
this
world
was
created
can
not
be
frustrated
unless
he
cease
to
be
god
and
those
enlivening
hopes
which
cheered
his
sons
those
spirits
that
lived
with
him
when
they
saw
this
beautiful
orb
fashioned
this
earth
made
as
the
place
for
their
habitation
as
their
possession
as
the
place
where
they
should
take
bodies
where
they
should
live
rule
and
reign
not
only
in
time
but
in
eternity
must
not
can
not
be
destroyed
and
yet
what
avails
it
all
to
them
if
satan
triumph
the
wicked
rule
and
god
kingdom
be
not
established
they
could
not
have
shouted
for
joy
at
the
prospect
of
this
world
continuing
under
the
dominion
of
satan
at
the
blight
degradation
misery
and
ruin
that
have
overspread
it
but
if
we
trace
the
matter
still
further
and
look
at
the
righteous
dead
their
position
would
be
any
thing
but
enviable
under
those
circumstances
it
was
the
hopes
of
the
resurrection
that
made
them
endure
and
it
was
god
that
implanted
them
in
their
bosoms
but
if
they
are
not
raised
and
if
christ
kingdom
is
not
established
and
they
do
not
reign
with
him
their
hopes
are
vain
their
sufferings
useless
and
the
purposes
of
god
are
frustrated
in
vain
did
they
bear
a
faithful
testimony
in
opposition
to
a
depraved
world
in
vain
they
endured
as
seeing
him
that
is
invisible
in
vain
they
wandered
about
in
sheep
skins
and
in
goat
skins
in
vain
they
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
as
a
recompense
of
reward
and
false
and
deceptive
are
the
testimonies
of
all
the
prophets
who
have
testified
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
take
away
this
and
our
highest
and
most
exalted
hopes
are
blighted
we
live
like
fools
and
die
like
dogs
if
the
world
is
always
suffered
to
continue
as
it
is
then
is
the
hope
of
the
righteous
vain
the
promises
of
god
fail
satan
triumphs
and
god
purposes
are
frustrated
all
the
designs
of
god
concerning
this
world
and
the
work
of
creation
were
perfected
in
his
mind
before
this
world
rolled
into
existence
or
the
morning
stars
sang
together
for
joy
when
this
world
was
formed
god
intended
it
as
the
final
dwelling
place
of
those
bodies
which
should
inhabit
it
and
when
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
it
was
at
the
prospect
of
that
exaltation
that
they
would
be
capable
of
obtaining
in
consequence
of
this
creation
which
they
then
saw
come
into
existence
and
if
as
jesus
they
had
to
descend
below
all
things
in
order
that
they
might
be
raised
above
all
things
still
this
was
the
medium
or
channel
through
which
they
were
to
obtain
their
ultimate
exaltation
and
glorification
it
was
by
the
union
of
their
spirits
which
came
forth
from
the
father
as
the
father
of
spirits
with
earthly
bodies
that
perfect
beings
were
formed
capable
of
continued
increase
and
eternal
exaltation
that
the
spirit
quick
subtle
refined
lively
animate
energetic
and
eternal
might
have
a
body
through
which
to
operate
that
might
be
compared
to
the
steam
to
an
engine
the
electric
fluid
to
the
telegraphic
wire
for
notwithstanding
that
spirit
steam
or
electricity
are
the
powerful
quickening
energetic
principles
employed
yet
without
the
engine
the
telegraphic
wire
or
the
matter
they
would
be
comparatively
useless
these
elements
might
wander
in
empty
space
spend
their
force
at
random
or
remain
dormant
or
useless
without
those
more
tangible
material
objects
through
which
to
exercise
their
force
when
steam
was
first
applied
to
practical
purposes
when
the
operation
of
the
magnetic
needle
and
the
mode
of
communication
through
the
electric
telegraph
were
discovered
when
railroads
and
steam
boats
were
first
invented
something
of
importance
was
discovered
and
of
great
value
to
the
human
family
the
men
who
made
these
discoveries
and
applications
are
deservedly
looked
upon
at
the
present
time
as
men
of
great
genius
and
as
the
benefactors
of
the
world
but
what
was
it
they
did
they
did
not
create
the
elements
those
already
existed
steam
magnetism
electricity
iron
coals
water
existed
before
and
had
existed
from
the
beginning
of
creation
what
was
it
these
geniuses
discovered
it
was
simply
a
method
of
organizing
this
matter
the
making
use
of
gross
inanimate
materials
to
confine
the
more
subtle
refined
elastic
energetic
and
powerful
that
their
combined
power
and
energy
might
be
brought
into
effect
and
that
through
the
union
of
two
powerful
agencies
which
had
lain
dormant
their
forces
might
be
united
and
be
brought
into
active
and
powerful
operation
thus
then
was
the
body
formed
as
an
agent
for
the
spirit
it
was
made
of
grosser
materials
than
the
spirit
which
proceeded
from
god
but
was
necessary
as
an
habitation
for
it
that
it
might
be
clothed
with
a
body
perfect
in
its
organization
beautiful
in
its
structure
symmetrical
in
its
proportions
and
in
every
way
fit
for
an
eternal
intelligent
being
that
through
it
it
might
speak
act
enjoy
and
develop
its
power
its
intelligence
and
perpetuate
its
species
hence
as
the
discoveries
of
those
geniuses
already
referred
to
were
hailed
with
pleasure
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
on
account
of
the
benefits
conferred
upon
men
so
when
god
created
this
earth
and
organized
men
upon
it
the
morning
stars
sung
together
for
joy
they
looked
upon
it
as
god
looked
upon
it
as
a
work
perfect
magnificent
and
glorious
through
which
they
saw
their
way
to
exaltation
glory
thrones
principalities
powers
dominions
and
eternal
felicity
they
had
the
intelligence
before
but
now
they
saw
a
way
through
which
to
develop
it
through
the
world
great
architect
their
father
they
discovered
a
plan
fraught
with
intelligence
and
wisdom
reaching
from
eternity
to
eternity
pointing
out
a
means
whereby
through
obedience
to
celestial
laws
they
might
obtain
the
same
power
that
he
had
and
if
in
fallen
humanity
they
might
have
to
suffer
for
a
while
they
saw
a
way
back
to
god
to
eternal
exaltations
and
to
the
multiplied
and
eternally
increasing
happiness
of
innumerable
millions
of
beings
and
if
as
jesus
they
had
to
descend
below
all
things
it
was
that
they
might
be
raised
above
all
things
and
take
their
position
as
sons
of
god
in
the
eternal
world
that
overcoming
the
world
they
might
sit
down
with
christ
upon
his
throne
as
he
overcame
and
sat
down
upon
the
father
throne

but
again
this
creation
is
unlike
the
works
of
man
which
however
excellent
and
useful
all
bear
the
marks
of
humanity
all
are
more
or
less
imperfect
in
their
structure
and
liable
to
a
thousand
contingences
are
more
or
less
clumsy
cumbrous
and
unwieldy
and
must
be
governed
by
numerous
very
limited
laws
as
for
instance
you
can
convey
intelligence
but
it
must
be
exactly
on
the
line
of
the
electric
wire
you
can
not
go
beyond
its
limits
you
can
make
an
engine
work
but
it
must
be
stationary
or
if
moving
must
be
confined
to
rails
depth
of
water
and
a
thousand
other
contingences
none
of
these
things
possess
intelligence
nor
the
principles
of
life
within
themselves
neither
can
they
impart
nor
perpetuate
it
to
others
they
are
merely
machines
to
be
acted
upon
by
man
and
without
man
they
cease
to
exist
when
one
is
worn
out
or
broken
another
must
be
made
at
the
same
toil
and
labour
possessing
not
the
principles
of
life
they
can
not
impart
their
likeness
whereas
man
beasts
fish
fowl
and
all
the
animate
works
of
god
can
man
works
in
comparison
with
god
are
like
comparing
a
child
wooden
horse
to
the
beautiful
creature
god
has
made
or
rather
his
penny
whistle
to
the
music
of
heaven
or
the
larger
boy
billiards
to
the
motions
of
the
planetary
system
they
possess
no
intelligence
no
powers
no
reflection
no
agency
the
works
of
man
are
merely
made
to
be
acted
upon
are
short
lived
temporary
perishable
things
man
however
bears
the
impress
of
jehovah
is
made
after
his
image
in
his
likeness
and
possesses
the
principles
of
intelligence
within
himself
and
the
medium
of
conveying
it
to
others
he
possesses
also
power
to
perpetuate
his
species
as
also
to
communicate
his
thoughts
his
intelligence
genius
and
power
to
others
that
are
formed
like
him
he
received
his
intelligence
his
spirit
from
god
he
is
a
part
of
himself
a
spark
of
deity
struck
from
the
fire
of
his
eternal
blaze
he
came
from
god
as
his
son
he
bears
the
impress
of
jehovah
even
in
his
fallen
degenerate
corrupted
state
his
powerful
intellect
his
stately
genius
his
grasping
ambition
his
soaring
and
in
many
instances
exalted
hopes
display
though
he
be
fallen
the
mark
of
greatness
he
bears
the
impress
of
deity
and
shows
that
he
is
of
divine
origin
unlike
the
works
of
man
the
work
of
god
in
relation
to
this
earth
was
destined
to
be
eternal
not
subject
to
be
controlled
by
any
little
contingences
nor
was
it
dependent
upon
fluctuation
or
change
works
might
fluctuate
change
or
be
destroyed
but
not
so
with
god
they
were
and
are
eternal
eternal
mind
and
eternal
matter
organized
and
created
according
to
the
unsearchable
intelligence
of
that
eternal
unfathomable
mind
that
fountain
of
intelligence
forethought
wisdom
and
energy
that
dwells
with
god
and
this
earth
and
man
in
their
destination
and
all
the
works
of
this
creation
are
as
unchangeable
as
the
sun
moon
or
stars
and
as
unalterable
as
the
throne
of
god
satan
may
deceive
men
for
a
season
their
minds
may
be
blinded
by
the
god
of
this
world
but
god
purposes
will
be
unchanged
who
is
satan
a
being
powerful
energetic
deceptive
insinuating
and
yet
necessary
to
develop
the
evil
as
there
are
bitters
to
make
us
appreciate
the
sweet
darkness
to
make
us
appreciate
light
evil
and
its
sorrows
that
we
may
appreciate
the
good
error
that
we
may
be
enabled
to
appreciate
truth
misery
in
order
that
we
may
appreciate
happiness
and
as
there
are
in
the
works
of
creation
opposing
mineralogical
substances
which
in
chemical
processes
are
necessary
to
develop
certain
properties
of
matter
and
produce
certain
effects
as
fire
is
necessary
to
purify
silver
gold
and
the
precious
metals
so
it
is
necessary
to
instruct
and
prepare
man
for
his
ultimate
destiny
to
test
his
virtue
develop
his
folly
exhibit
his
weakness
and
prove
his
incompetency
without
god
to
rule
himself
or
the
earth
or
to
make
himself
happy
or
exalt
himself
in
time
or
in
eternity
but
again
who
is
satan
he
is
a
being
of
god
own
make
under
his
control
subject
to
his
will
cast
out
of
heaven
for
rebellion
and
when
his
services
can
be
dispensed
with
an
angel
will
cast
him
into
the
bottomless
pit
can
he
fight
against
and
overcome
god
verily
no
can
he
alter
the
designs
of
god
verily
no
satan
may
rage
but
the
lord
can
confine
him
within
proper
limits
he
may
instigate
rebellion
against
god
but
the
lord
can
bind
him
in
chains
shall
the
purposes
of
the
lord
be
frustrated
verily
no
the
nations
of
the
earth
may
be
drunken
and
rush
against
each
other
like
inebriates
but
the
lord
purposes
are
unchanged
thrones
may
be
cast
down
kingdoms
depopulated
and
blood
sword
and
famine
may
prevail
yet
the
lord
lives
and
will
accomplish
his
own
designs
man
may
forget
god
but
god
does
not
forget
man
man
may
be
ignorant
of
his
calling
but
not
so
with
god
man
may
not
reflect
upon
the
designs
of
god
in
relation
to
this
earth
but
god
must
and
does
and
if
in
madness
his
infidelity
his
hypocrisy
or
his
ignorance
he
can
not
find
time
here
to
reflect
upon
these
things
he
will
find
ample
leisure
hereafter
and
the
purposes
of
god
will
roll
on
and
perhaps
when
he
shall
be
preached
to
as
the
rebellious
antediluvians
after
receiving
the
punishment
of
his
deeds
he
may
know
something
more
of
the
power
justice
and
purposes
of
god
and
be
glad
to
hear
the
gospel
in
prison
which
he
rejected
on
this
earth
but
to
suppose
that
the
purposes
of
god
will
be
frustrated
in
relation
to
his
designs
in
the
formation
of
this
earth
is
altogether
folly
they
will
roll
on
as
steadily
as
the
sun
or
moon
in
their
courses
and
as
surely
as
we
look
in
the
east
for
the
rising
of
the
sun
in
the
morning
to
display
his
gorgeous
glory
light
up
the
beauties
of
creation
and
waken
sleepy
man
so
surely
will
the
sun
of
righteousness
arise
with
healing
in
his
wings
so
surely
will
the
sleeping
dead
burst
from
their
tombs
and
the
glorified
bodies
with
their
spirits
so
surely
will
a
reign
of
justice
truth
equity
and
happiness
the
reign
of
god
supersede
the
barbarous
oppression
and
corrupt
governments
of
this
world
so
surely
will
that
long
night
of
darkness
ignorance
crime
and
error
be
superseded
by
the
glorious
day
of
righteousness
and
so
surely
will
this
earth
become
as
the
garden
of
the
lord
the
kingdom
and
reign
of
god
be
established
and
the
saints
of
the
most
high
take
the
kingdom
and
possess
it
for
ever
and
ever
the
time
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
will
be
ushered
in
the
earth
resume
its
paradisiacal
glory
and
the
dead
and
the
living
saints
possess
the
full
fruition
of
those
things
for
which
they
lived
and
suffered
and
died
these
are
the
hopes
that
the
ancient
saints
enjoyed
they
possessed
hopes
that
bloomed
with
immortality
and
eternal
life
hopes
planted
there
by
the
spirit
of
god
and
conferred
by
the
ministering
of
angels
the
visions
of
the
almighty
the
opening
of
the
heavens
and
the
promises
of
god
they
lived
and
died
in
hopes
of
a
better
resurrection
how
different
to
the
narrow
conceited
grovelling
views
of
philosophers
of
sickly
religionists
and
dreaming
philanthropists
therefore
as
we
have
said
anything
short
of
this
would
render
inutile
the
hopes
of
the
saints
would
fail
to
accomplish
the
expectation
of
millions
of
spirits
and
cause
satan
to
triumph
and
frustrate
the
designs
of
god
this
earth
after
wading
through
all
the
corruptions
of
men
being
cursed
for
his
sake
and
not
permitted
to
shed
forth
its
full
lustre
and
glory
must
yet
take
its
proper
place
in
creations
be
purified
from
that
corruption
under
which
it
has
groaned
for
ages
and
become
a
fit
place
for
redeemed
men
angels
and
god
to
dwell
upon
the
lord
jesus
will
come
and
dispossess
the
usurper
take
possession
of
his
own
kingdom
introduce
a
rule
of
righteousness
and
reign
there
with
his
saints
who
together
with
him
are
the
rightful
proprietors
chapter
x
will
god
kingdom
be
a
literal
or
a
spiritual
kingdom
it
would
be
almost
unnecessary
to
answer
such
a
question
as
the
above
were
it
not
for
the
opinions
that
are
entertained
in
the
world
concerning
a
purely
spiritual
kingdom
particularly
as
in
a
preceding
chapter
i
have
clearly
pointed
out
a
literal
kingdom
rule
and
reign
but
i
have
introduced
this
merely
to
meet
some
questions
that
exist
in
the
minds
of
many
relative
to
a
spiritual
kingdom
arising
from
certain
remarks
of
our
saviour
where
he
says
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
and
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
not
meat
and
drink
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
ghost
and
again
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
or
among
you
the
kingdom
of
god
as
i
have
already
stated
is
the
government
of
god
whether
in
the
heavens
or
on
the
earth
hence
jesus
taught
his
disciples
to
pray
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
done
in
heaven
and
when
the
kingdom
of
god
is
established
on
the
earth
and
prevails
universally
then
will
the
will
of
god
be
done
on
earth
and
not
till
then
then
will
the
reign
of
god
exist
on
the
earth
as
it
now
does
in
heaven
it
is
this
reign
we
are
speaking
of
a
reign
of
righteousness
but
whenever
god
laws
are
established
or
his
kingdom
is
organized
and
officers
selected
and
men
yield
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
of
god
to
such
an
extent
does
god
kingdom
prevail
john
preached
the
kingdom
of
god
or
heaven
nigh
at
hand
jesus
said
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
within
you
jesus
compared
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
a
husbandman
who
sowed
wheat
and
when
he
went
to
his
field
he
found
tares
also
matt
xiii
now
what
was
this
field
the
field
was
the
world
or
in
other
words
rightful
possession
where
he
ought
to
govern
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
or
those
who
receive
and
obey
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
or
those
who
rebel
against
god
and
his
laws
the
tares
are
to
be
gathered
out
of
his
kingdom
and
burned
and
then
are
the
righteous
to
shine
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of
their
father
again
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
likened
unto
a
treasure
that
a
man
found
in
a
field
and
sold
all
his
possessions
in
order
that
he
might
possess
himself
of
that
field
and
treasure
and
a
pearl
of
great
price
for
which
a
man
did
likewise
thus
abraham
noah
lot
moses
and
many
of
the
prophets
purchased
this
treasure
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
things
and
why
they
discovered
the
pearl
the
treasure
and
had
respect
unto
the
recompense
of
reward
enduring
as
seeing
him
who
is
invisible
and
what
was
it
all
for
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
present
blessings
earthly
enjoyments
the
pleasures
of
sense
no
they
all
died
in
faith
received
the
promises
but
having
seen
them
afar
off
they
knew
of
the
treasure
and
sold
all
for
it
they
looked
for
a
city
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
wherefore
it
is
said
god
is
not
ashamed
to
be
called
their
god
for
he
hath
prepared
for
them
a
city
they
looked
for
a
reign
of
righteousness
the
government
of
god
they
were
inspired
with
the
same
hope
as
that
of
all
the
prophets
who
had
prophesied
since
the
world
begun
the
hope
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
john
the
baptist
and
jesus
would
have
introduced
the
kingdom
but
the
people
would
not
have
it
still
as
the
apostle
john
says
to
as
many
as
did
believe
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
god
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name
john
i
they
became
sons
of
god
yes
say
some
spiritually
and
i
say
literally
too
they
made
a
literal
covenant
with
god
to
keep
his
laws
they
were
administered
to
literally
by
officers
of
the
kingdom
of
god
they
believed
literally
were
baptised
literally
and
received
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
literally
and
became
literally
the
servants
or
sons
of
god
but
what
was
their
hope
was
it
in
this
world
yes
but
not
at
the
present
they
expected
the
promise
of
jesus
to
be
fulfilled
to
them
blessed
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
inherit
the
earth
and
they
looked
with
peter
and
all
the
ancient
saints
for
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
they
looked
with
paul
and
the
saints
to
whom
he
wrote
for
a
kingdom
not
ariel
or
visionary
but
one
which
hath
foundations
whose
builder
and
maker
is
god
the
world
as
we
have
before
stated
although
it
belongs
to
god
has
never
been
under
his
control
his
vineyard
has
brought
forth
briars
and
thorns
tares
have
been
sown
in
his
field
but
there
has
been
some
wheat
and
that
wheat
represents
the
children
of
the
kingdom
who
have
kept
his
laws
and
observed
his
ordinances
and
wheresoever
the
laws
of
his
kingdom
have
been
observed
in
the
same
proportion
has
his
kingdom
prevailed
christ
therefore
organized
his
kingdom
with
apostles
prophets
pastors
teachers
evangelists
etc
officers
and
administrators
of
his
laws
which
laws
were
given
by
the
lord
they
baptized
for
the
remission
of
sins
laid
on
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
introduced
members
into
the
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
and
as
they
were
empowered
to
bind
on
earth
and
in
heaven
to
seal
on
earth
and
in
heaven
these
persons
not
only
became
members
of
the
church
here
but
also
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
participators
in
all
its
blessings
here
and
hereafter
they
were
now
sons
of
god
but
it
did
not
fully
appear
yet
what
they
should
be
only
they
should
be
like
him
if
he
conquered
death
so
should
they
if
he
overcame
so
should
they
if
he
sat
down
upon
his
father
throne
he
would
give
to
them
that
overcame
power
to
sit
down
upon
his
throne
as
he
overcame
and
sat
down
upon
his
father
throne
and
if
jesus
comes
to
reign
on
the
earth
he
will
also
bring
his
saints
with
him
and
they
shall
live
and
reign
with
him
these
things
are
spiritual
but
they
are
literal
they
are
temporal
but
they
are
also
spiritual
and
eternal
hence
with
god
all
things
are
temporal
all
things
are
spiritual
and
all
things
are
eternal
these
are
only
our
phrases
to
specify
certain
ideas
which
ideas
in
themselves
are
very
often
incorrect
we
have
bodies
and
spirits
but
it
takes
both
to
be
a
perfect
man
we
talk
about
time
and
eternity
what
is
time
a
portion
of
eternity
eternity
was
before
time
was
and
will
continue
to
exist
when
time
shall
be
no
more
spiritual
and
temporal
things
are
only
so
as
we
form
ideas
of
them
what
is
our
body
temporal
material
yes
matter
but
the
matter
of
which
it
is
made
is
eternal
and
it
will
yet
be
spiritual
like
unto
christ
glorious
body
what
is
our
spirit
material
spiritual
and
eternal
also
but
more
subtle
and
elastic
than
our
corporeal
bodies
having
said
so
much
on
this
subject
we
now
come
to
some
of
our
questions
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
not
meat
and
drink
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
ghost
what
are
we
to
understand
by
this
that
righteousness
composes
a
kingdom
righteousness
is
an
attribute
a
principle
a
state
of
being
not
a
government
peace
and
joy
are
the
result
of
this
attribute
god
is
righteous
and
consequently
righteousness
flows
from
him
there
may
be
also
a
righteous
man
but
we
do
not
say
that
god
is
a
kingdom
or
that
a
righteous
man
is
a
kingdom
but
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
a
righteous
kingdom
you
can
say
a
righteous
kingdom
a
kingdom
of
righteousness
but
you
can
not
say
righteousness
is
a
kingdom
a
kingdom
may
be
governed
by
righteous
laws
its
laws
may
be
righteous
its
administrators
righteous
its
people
righteous
but
to
say
righteousness
is
a
kingdom
is
nonsense
the
kingdom
of
god
is
a
righteous
kingdom
it
is
made
up
of
higher
enjoyments
than
eating
and
drinking
it
is
more
refined
and
elevated
it
is
a
kingdom
of
holiness
virtue
purity
of
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
ghost
principles
that
exist
in
part
now
as
far
as
the
kingdom
extends
when
the
kingdom
of
god
is
universal
it
will
like
the
kingdom
in
the
heavens
be
all
righteousness
peace
and
joy
in
the
holy
ghost
yet
it
will
have
its
laws
officers
and
administrators
and
will
be
a
literal
tangible
thing
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
be
poured
upon
all
flesh
the
will
of
god
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
and
the
joy
and
peace
which
result
from
righteousness
will
be
experienced
by
all
the
world
what
did
jesus
mean
then
when
he
said
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
within
you
or
among
you
marginal
reading
luke
xvii
there
certainly
must
be
some
mistake
here
for
jesus
was
speaking
to
pharisees
whom
he
had
denounced
as
corrupt
men
hypocrites
whited
walls
painted
sepulchres
etc
now
who
will
say
they
had
the
kingdom
of
god
within
them
the
kingdom
of
god
was
among
them
and
it
did
not
come
with
observation
nor
with
ostentation
or
pomp
they
might
have
seen
it
but
their
eyes
were
blinded
that
they
could
not
see
their
ears
were
stopped
that
they
could
not
hear
many
of
us
suppose
that
if
we
had
lived
in
their
day
we
should
have
recognized
it
among
the
miracles
signs
and
powers
that
were
manifested
by
him
but
jesus
said
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
know
me
and
follow
me
but
others
do
not
if
any
man
do
his
will
says
jesus
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of
god
or
whether
i
speak
of
myself
john
vii
but
if
they
do
not
what
then
they
have
eyes
but
see
not
ears
but
hear
not
the
god
of
this
world
blinds
their
eyes
lest
the
light
of
the
gospel
should
shine
in
upon
them
jesus
says
except
a
man
be
born
again
he
can
not
see
the
kingdom
of
god
and
except
he
is
born
of
water
and
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
into
it
john
iii
and
it
therefore
cometh
not
with
observation
the
scriptures
are
clear
on
the
point
and
show
to
the
last
that
when
god
kingdom
shall
be
more
fully
established
on
the
earth
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
will
be
as
ignorant
of
it
as
the
jews
were
that
jesus
was
the
messiah
for
the
nations
of
the
earth
with
their
kings
will
yet
be
gathered
together
against
the
people
of
the
lord
to
battle
when
the
lord
himself
will
go
and
fight
against
them
and
there
will
be
one
of
the
most
terrible
slaughters
that
ever
took
place
on
the
earth
it
cometh
with
it
is
a
righteous
kingdom
and
righteous
men
can
see
it
and
appreciate
it
and
those
only
i
have
demonstrated
in
a
preceding
chapter
to
which
i
refer
my
readers
more
fully
on
this
subject
that
the
kingdom
of
god
would
be
literally
established
on
the
earth
it
will
not
be
an
ariel
phantom
according
to
some
visionaries
but
a
substantial
reality
it
will
be
established
as
before
said
on
a
literal
earth
and
will
be
composed
of
literal
men
women
and
children
of
living
saints
who
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
of
resurrected
bodies
who
shall
actually
come
out
of
their
graves
and
live
on
the
earth
the
lord
will
be
king
over
all
the
earth
and
all
mankind
literally
under
his
sovereignty
and
every
nation
under
the
heavens
will
have
to
acknowledge
his
authority
and
bow
to
his
sceptre
those
who
serve
him
in
righteousness
will
have
communications
with
god
and
with
jesus
will
have
the
ministering
of
angels
and
will
know
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
and
other
people
who
may
not
yield
full
obedience
to
his
laws
nor
be
fully
instructed
in
his
covenants
will
nevertheless
have
to
yield
full
obedience
to
his
government
for
it
will
be
the
reign
of
god
upon
the
earth
and
he
will
enforce
his
laws
and
command
that
obedience
from
the
nations
of
the
world
which
is
legitimately
his
right
satan
will
not
then
be
permitted
to
control
its
inhabitants
for
the
lord
god
will
be
king
over
all
the
earth
and
the
kingdom
and
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heaven
will
be
given
to
the
saints
this
may
properly
be
called
the
day
of
reckoning
the
time
when
the
accounts
will
be
settled
when
things
that
have
been
going
wrong
for
ages
will
be
put
right
when
injustice
and
misrule
will
no
more
be
permitted
when
the
usurper
shall
be
cast
out
when
the
rightful
heir
shall
possess
the
kingdom
when
unrighteousness
will
be
banished
and
justice
and
judgement
bear
sway
when
the
wicked
shall
be
rooted
out
of
the
earth
and
the
saints
possess
it
when
god
designs
shall
be
accomplished
on
the
earth
and
men
resume
their
proper
position
it
is
the
fulfilment
of
the
promises
of
the
lord
to
his
people
or
in
scriptural
words
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
when
god
will
gather
together
all
things
in
one
satan
has
had
his
dominion
and
has
deceived
corrupted
and
cursed
the
human
family
but
then
his
dominion
will
be
destroyed
and
he
will
be
cast
into
the
bottomless
pit
men
will
no
longer
be
under
the
influence
of
his
spirit
be
decoyed
by
his
wiles
or
imposed
upon
by
his
deceptions
religion
and
the
fear
of
god
will
no
longer
be
painted
in
dismal
colours
or
be
dressed
in
the
sable
drapery
of
sanctimonious
priests
or
sacerdotal
gloom
nor
yet
in
the
forbidding
costumes
of
hermits
monks
and
nuns
but
stript
of
all
this
religious
masquerade
and
superstitious
mummery
the
fear
of
god
and
the
observance
of
his
laws
will
be
looked
upon
in
their
proper
light
god
will
be
seen
feared
and
worshipped
as
our
father
friend
and
benefactor
his
laws
will
be
kept
as
being
those
framed
by
infinite
wisdom
and
the
most
conducive
to
the
happiness
of
the
human
family
virtue
truth
and
righteousness
will
appear
in
their
native
loveliness
beauty
simplicity
glory
and
magnificence
for
god
alone
will
be
exalted
in
that
day
chapter
xi
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
god
upon
the
earth
how
will
the
kingdom
of
god
be
established
we
have
already
shown
very
clearly
that
none
of
the
means
which
are
now
used
among
men
are
commensurate
with
the
object
designed
and
that
all
the
combined
wisdom
of
man
must
and
will
fail
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
that
the
present
forms
of
political
and
religious
rule
can
not
effect
it
that
philosophy
is
quite
as
impotent
and
that
as
these
have
all
failed
for
ages
as
a
natural
consequence
they
must
continue
to
fail
we
have
portrayed
the
world
broken
corrupted
fallen
degraded
and
ruined
and
shown
that
nothing
but
a
world
god
can
put
it
right
the
question
is
what
course
will
god
take
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
thing
and
as
this
is
a
matter
that
requires
more
than
human
reason
and
as
we
are
left
entirely
to
revelation
either
past
present
or
to
come
it
is
to
this
only
that
we
can
apply
we
will
enquire
therefore
what
the
scriptures
say
on
this
subject
it
is
called
the
kingdom
of
god
or
the
kingdom
of
heaven
if
therefore
it
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
must
receive
its
organization
and
from
heaven
for
if
they
were
earthly
then
would
they
be
like
those
on
the
earth
the
kingdom
of
heaven
must
therefore
be
the
government
and
laws
of
heaven
on
the
earth
if
the
government
and
laws
of
heaven
are
known
and
observed
on
the
earth
they
must
be
communicated
or
revealed
from
the
heavens
to
the
earth
these
things
are
plain
and
evident
if
we
are
to
have
any
kingdom
of
heaven
for
it
is
very
clear
that
if
it
is
not
god
rule
it
can
not
be
his
and
it
is
as
evident
that
if
it
is
not
revealed
from
heaven
it
can
not
be
the
of
that
such
a
kingdom
will
be
set
up
is
evident
from
the
following
and
in
the
days
of
these
kings
shall
the
god
of
heaven
set
up
a
kingdom
which
shall
never
be
destroyed
and
the
kingdom
shall
not
be
left
to
other
people
dan
ii
and
again
i
saw
in
the
night
visions
and
behold
one
like
the
son
of
man
came
with
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
came
to
the
ancient
of
days
and
they
brought
him
near
before
him
and
there
was
given
him
dominion
and
glory
and
a
kingdom
that
all
people
nations
and
languages
should
serve
him
his
dominion
is
an
everlasting
dominion
which
shall
not
pass
away
and
his
kingdom
that
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
dan
vii
from
the
above
we
learn
two
things
first
that
god
will
set
up
a
kingdom
which
shall
be
universal
and
that
that
kingdom
shall
not
be
given
into
the
hands
of
other
people
and
secondly
that
the
saints
of
god
shall
take
possession
of
that
kingdom
the
angel
which
announced
to
mary
the
birth
of
jesus
said
he
shall
be
great
and
shall
be
called
the
son
of
the
highest
and
the
lord
god
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
david
and
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
for
ever
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
end
luke
i
it
may
not
be
improper
here
to
notice
an
opinion
that
has
very
generally
prevailed
throughout
the
christian
world
that
kingdom
was
a
spiritual
kingdom
that
it
was
set
up
at
the
time
our
saviour
was
upon
the
earth
and
that
christianity
as
it
now
exists
is
that
kingdom
after
what
i
have
already
written
on
the
subject
of
a
literal
reign
and
kingdom
this
would
seem
superfluous
but
as
this
opinion
is
almost
universal
in
the
christian
world
my
readers
must
excuse
me
if
in
this
instance
i
digress
a
little
several
writers
in
the
catholic
church
as
well
as
the
rev
david
simpson
bishop
burnett
the
rev
john
wesley
and
many
others
among
the
protestants
have
advocated
the
above
opinion
the
substance
of
their
ideas
is
as
follows
that
daniel
by
the
figure
of
an
image
of
gold
silver
brass
iron
clay
in
chap
and
by
the
figures
of
the
four
beasts
in
chap
represented
a
spiritual
kingdom
that
this
kingdom
was
set
up
in
the
days
of
the
saviour
and
his
disciples
that
christianity
as
it
now
exists
is
that
kingdom
and
that
it
will
become
universal
over
all
the
earth
they
state
that
the
four
great
empires
the
babylonian
persian
grecian
and
roman
are
represented
by
the
head
breast
belly
and
legs
of
the
image
and
by
the
four
beasts
in
chapter
vii
and
that
the
kingdom
of
god
was
to
be
set
up
under
the
dominion
of
the
fourth
which
as
they
correctly
state
was
the
roman
they
state
moreover
that
the
declaration
and
prophecy
of
the
angel
to
mary
above
quoted
were
also
fulfilled
in
the
first
coming
of
the
messiah
in
his
preaching
in
his
gospel
and
in
the
organizing
of
the
church
etc
many
other
passages
are
made
to
bear
the
same
signification
which
it
would
be
foreign
from
my
present
purpose
to
notice
i
have
referred
to
the
above
as
some
of
the
most
prominent
now
with
all
deference
to
the
gentlemen
who
have
written
on
this
subject
and
education
respectability
and
talent
entitle
their
opinions
to
some
respect
i
must
beg
leave
to
differ
from
them
and
consider
that
in
trying
to
support
a
favorite
dogma
they
have
been
led
into
error
for
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
can
be
more
foreign
to
the
meaning
of
these
scriptures
than
the
above
interpretation
now
concerning
the
four
great
monarchies
being
represented
as
above
i
consider
it
is
perfectly
correct
but
to
state
that
the
kingdom
was
to
be
set
up
under
the
fourth
monarchy
or
under
the
dominion
of
the
fourth
beast
is
stretching
the
thing
too
far
and
putting
a
construction
upon
it
which
it
evidently
will
not
bear
the
text
reads
in
the
days
of
those
kings
shall
the
god
of
heaven
set
up
a
kingdom
the
question
is
what
kings
i
am
answered
during
the
reign
of
one
of
the
four
and
that
as
christ
came
during
the
reign
and
dominion
of
the
roman
empire
it
evidently
refers
to
that
but
let
me
again
ask
a
question
under
the
reign
of
what
kings
was
this
kingdom
to
be
set
up
under
the
reign
of
the
fourth
verily
no
let
daniel
speak
for
himself
after
describing
the
fourth
kingdom
which
was
the
roman
which
is
compared
to
iron
and
which
in
the
image
was
represented
by
the
legs
he
then
refers
to
other
kingdoms
and
powers
as
being
compared
to
iron
and
clay
there
were
also
feet
and
toes
as
well
as
a
which
were
compared
to
powers
or
kings
this
is
clearly
exemplified
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
daniel
for
after
speaking
of
the
four
kings
he
describes
ten
horns
of
which
the
ten
toes
in
the
image
above
referred
to
are
typical
those
ten
horns
he
says
are
ten
kings
it
was
then
in
the
days
of
those
kings
or
while
those
kingdoms
should
be
in
existence
that
the
god
of
heaven
should
set
up
a
kingdom
and
not
during
the
power
of
the
fourth
kingdom
to
which
with
any
degree
of
truthfulness
the
figure
could
not
apply
in
either
case
but
again
it
could
not
apply
to
the
first
coming
of
our
saviour
for
the
following
reasons
the
stone
hewn
out
of
the
mountain
without
hands
was
to
smite
the
image
on
the
toes
whereas
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
divines
before
referred
to
the
toes
were
not
yet
in
existence
for
they
state
that
this
kingdom
was
set
up
during
the
fourth
monarchy
which
was
the
roman
and
which
is
represented
in
the
legs
of
the
image
now
as
the
powers
composing
the
feet
and
toes
were
not
yet
formed
how
could
the
little
stone
smite
that
which
was
not
in
existence
for
it
will
be
observed
that
after
the
whole
image
was
made
the
stone
was
hewn
out
of
the
mountains
without
hands
which
smote
it
when
this
kingdom
is
set
up
it
is
stated
it
not
be
left
to
other
people
but
we
are
told
in
dan
vii
that
after
the
fourth
monarchy
which
was
the
time
according
to
the
aforesaid
interpretation
for
the
setting
up
of
the
kingdom
of
god
a
certain
horn
or
king
should
make
war
with
the
saints
and
prevail
against
them
and
that
he
should
think
to
change
times
and
laws
and
that
they
should
be
into
his
nothing
can
be
more
obvious
than
this
for
this
power
after
the
first
coming
of
the
messiah
not
only
thinks
to
change
times
and
laws
but
they
are
actually
given
into
his
hand
which
will
not
be
the
case
when
the
kingdom
above
referred
to
is
set
up
when
the
kingdom
of
god
was
to
be
set
up
it
was
to
be
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
high
and
all
nations
kindreds
people
and
tongues
were
to
obey
the
lord
which
has
not
taken
place
and
never
can
under
the
present
state
of
things
there
is
no
more
similarity
between
christianity
as
it
now
exists
with
all
its
superstitions
corruptions
jargons
contentions
divisions
weakness
and
imbecility
and
this
kingdom
of
god
as
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
than
there
is
between
light
and
darkness
and
it
would
no
more
compare
with
things
to
come
than
an
orange
would
compare
with
the
earth
or
a
taper
with
the
glorious
luminary
of
day
the
kingdom
of
god
as
spoken
of
by
daniel
was
to
become
universal
which
christianity
has
not
and
can
not
as
it
now
exists
the
angel
testimony
to
mary
has
not
yet
been
fulfilled
it
is
stated
that
the
lord
shall
give
unto
him
the
throne
of
his
father
david
and
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
for
ever
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
end
whereas
he
did
not
sit
upon
throne
nor
does
he
now
he
did
not
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
nor
does
he
now
for
the
ten
tribes
are
yet
outcasts
the
house
of
judah
is
scattered
and
without
a
king
and
jesus
himself
when
asked
to
divide
an
inheritance
demanded
who
made
me
a
ruler
or
king
he
indeed
was
a
king
but
in
his
humiliation
his
judgement
was
taken
away
from
the
whole
of
the
above
it
is
very
evident
that
the
kingdom
of
which
these
divines
speak
was
not
and
could
not
be
the
one
referred
to
by
daniel
or
by
the
angel
to
mary
as
we
have
before
stated
it
was
a
literal
kingdom
and
not
a
spiritual
one
only
i
would
further
remark
here
that
a
certain
power
was
to
make
war
with
the
saints
and
to
prevail
against
them
until
the
ancient
of
days
came
and
then
and
not
till
then
was
judgement
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
high
we
will
now
return
from
our
digression
and
after
stating
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
a
literal
kingdom
that
it
will
be
great
powerful
glorious
and
universal
and
that
it
will
extend
from
sea
to
sea
and
from
the
rivers
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
that
all
kingdoms
will
be
in
subjection
to
it
and
all
powers
obey
it
we
will
proceed
to
examine
how
it
will
be
established
it
is
compared
to
a
small
stone
hewn
out
of
the
mountain
without
hands
and
yet
the
god
of
heaven
is
to
set
up
this
kingdom
isaiah
in
his
eleventh
chapter
to
which
i
refer
my
readers
in
speaking
of
the
establishment
of
this
kingdom
says
in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
root
of
jesse
which
shall
stand
for
an
ensign
of
the
people
to
it
shall
the
gentiles
seek
and
his
rest
shall
be
glorious
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
the
lord
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
the
remnant
of
his
people
which
shall
be
left
from
assyria
and
from
egypt
and
from
pathros
and
from
cush
and
from
elam
and
from
shinar
and
from
hamath
and
from
the
islands
of
the
sea
and
he
shall
set
up
an
ensign
for
the
nations
and
shall
assemble
the
outcasts
of
israel
and
gather
together
the
dispersed
of
judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
from
the
above
it
would
seem
that
an
ensign
or
standard
is
to
be
raised
to
the
nations
that
the
gentiles
shall
seek
to
it
and
that
the
ten
tribes
return
as
well
as
the
jews
to
their
land
that
the
dispersed
of
judah
and
the
outcasts
of
israel
are
to
return
now
a
standard
or
ensign
is
a
nation
colours
flag
or
rallying
point
it
is
one
of
those
appendages
to
a
kingdom
that
is
always
respected
by
its
inhabitants
it
is
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
and
for
different
purposes
sometimes
by
the
emperor
king
governor
or
general
to
signify
his
presence
sometimes
by
vessels
to
specify
their
nation
and
sometimes
by
estates
cities
corporations
or
clubs
and
always
by
armies
and
navies
to
represent
whom
they
belong
to
if
a
king
had
a
proclamation
to
make
and
wished
to
rally
his
subjects
or
try
their
fidelity
he
might
send
a
flag
or
standard
and
all
that
rallied
to
it
would
be
considered
his
liege
subjects
but
here
the
god
of
heaven
sets
up
a
standard
the
world
as
we
have
before
stated
is
his
it
is
his
right
to
possess
it
satan
has
held
the
dominion
for
some
time
and
the
lord
now
comes
to
dispossess
him
to
take
possession
of
his
rightful
inheritance
and
to
rule
his
own
kingdom
in
order
to
do
this
he
issues
his
mandate
makes
a
proclamation
lifts
up
a
standard
and
invites
all
to
join
it
those
who
do
may
be
considered
as
his
servants
as
the
citizens
of
his
kingdom
those
who
do
not
as
being
in
opposition
to
him
his
government
and
laws
as
the
father
of
the
human
family
as
the
prince
and
king
he
lifts
up
an
ensign
and
calls
the
world
attention
now
the
only
rational
way
for
the
lord
to
accomplish
this
is
to
form
a
communication
with
man
and
to
make
him
acquainted
with
his
laws
we
can
not
conceive
of
him
thundering
from
the
heavens
and
terrifying
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
nor
yet
sending
angels
with
flaming
swords
to
coerce
obedience
this
would
be
using
physical
power
to
control
the
mind
but
as
man
is
a
free
agent
he
uses
other
means
to
act
upon
his
mind
his
judgement
and
his
will
and
by
the
beauty
and
loveliness
of
virtue
purity
holiness
and
the
fear
of
god
to
captivate
his
feelings
control
his
judgement
and
influence
him
to
render
that
obedience
to
god
which
is
justly
his
due
not
until
these
means
fail
will
others
be
exercised
as
the
world
are
ignorant
of
god
and
his
laws
not
having
had
any
communication
with
him
for
eighteen
hundred
years
and
as
all
those
great
and
important
events
must
transpire
and
as
the
lord
says
he
will
do
nothing
but
what
he
reveals
to
his
servants
the
prophets
it
follows
that
there
must
be
revelations
made
from
god
and
if
so
as
a
necessary
consequence
there
must
be
prophets
to
reveal
them
to
how
did
god
ever
reveal
his
will
and
purposes
to
enoch
noah
abraham
moses
the
prophets
jesus
and
his
disciples
and
they
to
the
people
god
messengers
made
known
his
will
and
the
people
obeyed
or
rejected
it
if
they
were
punished
by
floods
fire
plagues
pestilence
dispersions
death
it
was
in
consequence
of
their
disobedience
as
god
has
dealt
in
former
times
so
will
he
in
the
latter
with
this
difference
that
he
will
accomplish
his
purposes
in
the
last
days
he
will
set
up
his
kingdom
he
will
protect
the
righteous
satan
and
his
works
purge
the
earth
from
wickedness
and
bring
in
the
restitution
of
all
things
the
above
while
it
is
the
only
rational
way
is
evidently
the
only
just
and
scriptural
way
some
people
talk
about
the
world
being
burned
up
about
plagues
pestilence
famine
sword
and
ruin
and
all
these
things
being
instantaneous
now
it
would
not
be
just
for
the
lord
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
without
warning
for
if
the
world
are
ignorant
of
god
they
can
not
altogether
be
blamed
for
it
if
they
are
made
the
dupes
of
false
systems
and
false
principles
they
can
not
help
it
many
of
them
are
doing
as
well
as
they
can
while
as
we
have
before
stated
it
would
be
unjust
for
the
world
to
continue
as
it
is
it
would
at
the
same
time
be
as
unjust
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
for
things
that
they
are
ignorant
of
or
for
things
over
which
they
have
no
control
before
the
lord
destroyed
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
world
he
sent
enoch
and
noah
to
warn
them
before
the
lord
destroyed
sodom
and
gomorrah
he
sent
lot
into
their
midst
before
the
children
of
israel
were
carried
captive
to
babylon
they
were
warned
of
it
by
the
prophets
and
before
jerusalem
was
destroyed
the
inhabitants
had
the
testimony
of
our
lord
and
his
disciples
and
so
will
it
be
in
the
last
days
and
as
it
is
the
world
that
is
concerned
the
world
will
have
to
be
warned
we
will
therefore
proceed
to
examine
the
scriptural
testimony
on
this
subject
john
says
in
the
revelations
and
i
saw
another
angel
fly
in
the
midst
of
heaven
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
unto
them
that
dwell
on
the
earth
and
to
every
nation
and
kindred
tongue
and
people
saying
with
a
loud
voice
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgement
is
come
and
worship
him
that
made
heaven
and
earth
the
sea
and
the
fountains
of
waters
and
there
followed
another
angel
saying
bahylon
the
great
is
fallen
xiv
here
then
a
light
bursts
forth
from
the
heavens
a
celestial
messenger
is
deputed
to
convey
to
men
tidings
of
salvation
the
everlasting
gospel
is
again
to
be
proclaimed
to
the
children
of
men
the
proclamation
is
to
be
made
to
every
nation
kindred
people
and
tongue
associated
with
this
was
to
be
another
declaration
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgement
is
come
thus
all
were
to
have
a
fair
warning
and
afterwards
babylon
falls
not
before
from
the
above
it
is
evident
that
the
everlasting
gospel
will
be
restored
accompanied
with
a
warning
to
the
world
now
if
the
everlasting
gospel
is
restored
there
must
be
the
same
principles
laws
officers
or
administrators
and
ordinances
if
before
they
had
apostles
they
will
again
have
them
the
same
laws
and
ordinances
will
be
introduced
and
the
same
method
for
receiving
members
into
the
kingdom
they
will
also
have
prophets
pastors
teachers
and
evangelists
if
they
baptised
by
immersion
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
laid
on
hands
for
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
they
will
again
do
the
same
things
if
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
formerly
brought
things
past
to
the
saints
remembrance
led
them
into
all
truth
and
showed
them
things
to
come
it
will
do
the
same
again
for
it
is
the
everlasting
gospel
if
formerly
it
caused
men
to
dream
dreams
and
to
see
visions
it
will
do
the
same
again
if
to
one
was
given
the
gift
of
tongues
to
another
the
gift
of
healing
to
another
power
to
work
miracles
to
another
the
gift
of
wisdom
the
same
will
exist
in
latter
days
for
it
is
the
everlasting
gospel
which
is
to
be
restored
if
it
put
men
in
possession
of
a
knowledge
of
god
and
of
his
purposes
and
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
in
former
days
it
will
do
the
same
again
if
it
dispelled
the
clouds
of
darkness
unveiled
the
heavens
put
men
in
possession
of
certainty
and
gave
them
a
hope
that
bloomed
with
immortality
and
eternal
life
it
will
do
the
same
again
if
it
caused
men
to
know
the
object
of
their
creation
their
relationship
to
god
their
position
on
the
earth
and
their
final
exaltation
and
glory
it
will
do
the
same
again
for
it
is
the
everlasting
gospel
in
short
it
is
the
will
of
god
to
man
the
government
of
god
among
men
and
a
portion
of
that
light
glory
and
intelligence
which
exist
with
god
and
angels
communicated
to
mortals
and
obtained
through
obedience
to
his
laws
and
ordinances
if
the
gospel
formerly
was
to
be
proclaimed
to
all
nations
so
it
is
now
with
this
difference
associated
with
it
there
is
to
be
a
cry
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgement
is
come
from
this
then
we
may
expect
a
proclamation
to
be
made
to
all
people
messengers
to
go
forth
to
every
nation
and
the
same
principles
which
once
existed
to
be
again
restored
in
all
their
fulness
power
glory
and
blessings
the
above
is
the
way
pointed
out
in
the
scriptures
and
is
the
only
just
and
rational
way
to
deal
with
rational
intelligent
beings
for
intelligence
must
be
appealed
to
by
intelligence
and
it
would
be
unjust
to
punish
the
world
indiscriminately
without
first
appealing
to
their
reason
judgement
and
intelligence
but
not
only
will
the
everlasting
gospel
be
again
restored
and
be
preached
in
its
fulness
as
formerly
and
go
as
a
messenger
to
all
the
world
not
only
will
there
be
a
spiritual
kingdom
and
organization
but
there
will
also
be
a
literal
kingdom
a
nation
or
nations
a
zion
and
the
people
will
gather
to
that
we
will
here
insert
a
prophecy
of
david
on
this
subject
but
thou
o
lord
shalt
endure
for
ever
and
thy
remembrance
unto
all
generations
thou
shalt
arise
and
have
mercy
upon
zion
for
the
time
to
favor
her
yea
the
set
time
is
come
for
thy
servants
take
pleasure
in
her
stones
and
favor
the
dust
thereof
so
the
heathen
shall
fear
the
name
of
the
lord
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
thy
glory
when
the
lord
shall
build
up
zion
he
shall
appear
in
his
glory
he
will
regard
the
prayer
of
the
destitute
and
not
despise
their
prayer
this
shall
be
written
for
the
generation
to
come
and
the
people
which
shall
be
created
shall
praise
the
lord
for
he
hath
looked
down
from
the
height
of
his
sanctuary
from
heaven
did
the
lord
behold
the
earth
to
hear
the
groaning
of
the
prisoner
to
loose
those
that
are
appointed
to
death
to
declare
the
name
of
the
lord
in
zion
and
his
praise
in
jerusalem
when
the
people
are
gathered
together
and
the
kingdoms
to
serve
the
lord
psalm
cii
here
we
find
first
that
a
literal
zion
is
to
be
built
up
secondly
that
when
that
zion
is
built
up
the
lord
will
come
will
appear
in
his
glory
thirdly
that
it
is
something
which
concerns
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
the
whole
world
for
there
shall
the
people
be
gathered
together
and
the
kingdoms
to
serve
the
lord
it
may
be
proper
here
to
remark
that
there
will
be
two
places
of
gathering
or
zions
the
one
in
jerusalem
the
other
in
another
place
the
one
is
a
place
where
the
jews
will
gather
to
and
the
other
a
mixed
multitude
of
all
nations
concerning
the
house
of
israel
jeremiah
says
therefore
behold
the
days
come
saith
the
lord
that
it
shall
no
more
be
said
the
lord
liveth
that
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
but
the
lord
liveth
that
brought
up
the
children
of
israel
from
the
land
of
the
north
and
from
all
the
lands
whither
he
had
driven
them
and
i
will
bring
them
again
into
their
land
that
i
gave
unto
their
fathers
xvi
according
to
this
passage
and
many
others
there
will
evidently
be
a
great
display
of
the
power
of
god
manifested
towards
the
house
of
israel
in
their
restitution
to
their
former
habitations
another
scripture
says
that
jerusalem
shall
be
inhabited
in
her
own
place
even
in
jerusalem
here
i
would
remark
that
there
was
a
zion
formerly
in
jerusalem
but
there
is
also
another
spoken
of
in
the
scriptures
hence
in
the
passage
which
we
quoted
from
the
psalms
the
kingdoms
are
to
be
gathered
together
in
zion
and
the
people
to
serve
the
lord
and
not
only
the
jews
but
the
heathens
are
to
fear
the
name
of
the
lord
and
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
his
glory
the
law
is
to
issue
from
zion
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
again
the
lord
god
that
gathereth
the
outcasts
of
israel
says
yet
will
i
gather
others
unto
me
besides
these
it
is
very
evident
from
these
passages
that
there
are
two
places
of
gathering
as
well
as
from
many
others
that
might
be
quoted
for
example
joel
in
speaking
of
the
troubles
of
the
last
days
says
there
shall
in
the
last
days
be
deliverance
in
mount
zion
and
in
jerusalem
now
he
never
could
say
with
propriety
in
mount
zion
and
in
jerusalem
if
these
were
not
two
places
the
ancient
zion
was
in
jerusalem
it
would
not
be
proper
to
say
in
london
and
in
london
but
you
could
say
in
london
and
in
edinburgh
in
new
york
and
in
philadelphia
in
frankfort
and
in
brussels
and
so
you
can
say
in
zion
and
in
jerusalem
but
again
the
jews
are
to
be
gathered
to
jerusalem
in
unbelief
as
spoken
of
in
zechariah
and
when
the
messiah
appears
among
them
being
ignorant
of
jesus
they
shall
ask
what
are
these
wounds
in
thy
hands
then
he
shall
answer
those
with
which
i
was
wounded
in
the
house
of
my
friends
xiii
and
then
a
fountain
shall
be
opened
for
the
house
of
david
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
and
they
will
enter
into
the
covenant
by
baptism
xiii
but
the
people
of
zion
the
lord
will
take
them
one
of
a
city
and
two
of
a
family
and
bring
them
there
and
give
them
pastors
after
his
own
heart
that
shall
feed
them
with
knowledge
and
understanding
jer
iii
the
people
there
are
to
be
all
righteous
it
is
the
last
zion
that
we
wish
more
particularly
to
speak
of
at
present
as
associated
with
the
kingdom
of
god
and
as
we
are
now
searching
out
the
manner
in
which
the
kingdom
of
god
will
be
established
it
is
to
us
a
matter
of
great
importance
there
are
very
great
judgements
spoken
of
in
the
last
days
as
the
consequence
of
man
departure
from
god
these
we
have
already
referred
to
in
part
but
as
we
have
mentioned
the
gospel
must
again
be
preached
as
a
warning
unto
all
nations
and
accompanied
with
it
is
to
be
a
proclamation
fear
god
and
give
glory
to
him
for
the
hour
of
his
judgement
is
come
rev
xiv
but
the
people
would
very
reasonably
be
heard
to
enquire
what
can
we
do
what
hope
have
we
if
war
comes
we
can
not
either
prevent
or
avoid
it
if
plague
stalks
through
the
earth
what
guarantee
have
we
of
deliverance
you
say
you
have
come
as
messengers
of
mercy
to
us
and
as
the
messengers
of
the
nations
what
shall
we
do
let
isaiah
answer
he
has
told
the
tale
of
war
and
defined
the
remedy
this
shall
be
the
answer
of
the
messenger
of
the
nations
that
the
lord
hath
founded
zion
and
the
poor
of
his
people
shall
trust
in
it
xiv
yes
says
joel
when
this
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord
comes
there
shall
be
deliverance
in
mount
zion
and
in
jerusalem
as
the
lord
hath
said
and
in
the
remnant
whom
the
lord
shall
call
ii
yes
says
jeremiah
he
will
take
them
one
of
a
city
and
two
of
a
family
and
bring
them
to
zion
and
give
them
pastors
after
his
own
heart
that
shall
feed
them
with
knowledge
and
understanding
iii
the
proclamation
to
the
world
will
be
the
means
of
establishing
this
zion
by
gathering
together
multitudes
of
people
from
among
all
nations
for
there
are
multitudes
among
all
nations
who
are
sincerely
desirous
to
do
the
will
of
god
when
they
are
made
acquainted
with
it
but
having
been
cajoled
with
priestcraft
and
abominations
so
long
they
know
not
which
course
to
steer
and
are
jealous
of
almost
everything
as
it
was
formerly
so
will
it
be
in
the
latter
times
jesus
said
my
sheep
hear
my
voice
and
know
me
and
follow
me
and
a
stranger
they
will
not
follow
for
they
know
not
the
voice
of
strangers
those
who
love
truth
and
desire
to
be
governed
by
it
will
embrace
it
and
enter
into
the
covenant
which
the
lord
will
make
with
his
people
in
the
last
days
and
be
gathered
with
them
they
will
be
taught
of
the
lord
in
zion
will
form
his
kingdom
on
the
earth
and
will
be
prepared
for
the
lord
when
he
comes
to
take
possession
of
his
kingdom
for
when
the
lord
shall
build
up
zion
he
shall
appear
in
his
glory
and
not
before
but
if
zion
is
never
built
up
the
lord
never
will
come
for
he
must
have
a
people
and
a
place
to
come
to
the
prophets
hailed
this
day
with
pleasure
as
the
ushering
in
of
those
glorious
times
which
were
to
follow
micah
says
but
in
the
last
days
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
mountain
of
the
house
of
the
lord
shall
be
established
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
and
it
shall
be
exalted
above
the
hills
and
people
shall
flow
unto
it
and
many
nations
shall
come
and
say
come
and
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
lord
and
to
the
house
of
the
god
of
jacob
and
he
will
teach
us
of
his
ways
and
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
for
the
law
shall
go
forth
of
zion
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
iv
isaiah
with
rapture
gazed
upon
the
scene
and
in
ecstacy
cried
out
who
are
these
that
fly
as
a
cloud
and
as
the
doves
to
their
windows
surely
the
isles
shall
wait
for
me
and
the
ships
of
tarshish
first
to
bring
thy
sons
from
afar
their
silver
and
their
gold
with
them
unto
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
and
to
the
holy
one
of
israel
because
he
hath
glorified
thee
and
the
sons
of
strangers
shall
build
up
thy
walls
and
their
kings
shall
minister
unto
thee
lx
you
will
find
by
reading
the
verse
that
this
place
is
to
be
called
the
city
of
the
lord
the
zion
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
here
then
we
find
that
the
lord
will
have
a
house
built
that
it
shall
be
upon
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
be
exalted
above
the
hills
that
many
nations
shall
go
there
to
learn
the
will
of
the
lord
and
that
the
law
shall
go
forth
from
zion
that
the
people
shall
come
as
clouds
to
it
that
they
shall
take
their
silver
and
gold
with
them
that
god
worship
will
be
known
and
the
religion
of
the
lord
will
lose
its
forbidding
aspect
and
god
and
his
religion
be
popular
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
this
brings
us
to
another
means
that
will
be
made
use
of
for
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
god
for
before
this
he
will
rebuke
strong
nations
that
are
off
and
before
they
beat
their
swords
into
ploughshares
and
their
spears
into
pruning
hooks
and
nations
shall
have
war
no
a
there
will
be
a
time
of
terrible
trouble
and
distress
of
war
and
calamity
such
as
never
has
been
before
on
the
earth
having
noticed
in
the
above
that
a
standard
will
be
raised
to
the
nations
that
the
gospel
will
be
preached
again
to
all
people
and
a
proclamation
be
made
to
all
nations
that
a
literal
zion
will
be
built
that
the
righteous
will
flock
to
that
zion
and
be
taught
of
the
lord
and
be
prepared
for
his
coming
that
great
multitudes
will
flow
to
zion
and
the
blessing
of
god
dwell
there
we
now
come
to
point
out
another
way
that
the
kingdom
of
god
will
be
established
by
judgements
that
the
nations
may
be
purified
and
prepared
for
an
universal
reign
footnote
a
if
any
one
wish
further
information
on
this
subject
i
refer
them
to
pratt
new
jerusalem
liverpool
w
richards
before
the
lord
destroyed
the
old
world
he
directed
noah
to
prepare
an
ark
before
the
cities
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
were
destroyed
he
told
lot
to
flee
to
the
mountains
before
jerusalem
was
destroyed
jesus
gave
his
disciples
warning
and
told
them
to
flee
out
of
it
and
before
the
destruction
of
the
world
a
message
is
sent
after
this
the
nations
will
be
judged
for
god
is
now
preparing
his
own
kingdom
for
his
own
reign
and
will
not
be
thwarted
by
any
conflicting
influence
or
opposing
power
the
testimony
of
god
is
first
to
be
made
known
the
standard
is
to
be
raised
the
gospel
of
the
kingdom
is
to
be
preached
to
all
nations
the
world
is
to
be
warned
and
then
come
the
troubles
the
whole
world
is
in
confusion
morally
politically
and
religiously
but
a
voice
was
to
be
heard
come
out
of
her
my
people
that
you
partake
not
of
her
sins
and
that
ye
receive
not
of
her
plagues
john
saw
an
angel
having
the
everlasting
gospel
to
preach
to
every
nation
kindred
people
and
tongue
and
afterwards
there
was
another
cried
babylon
is
fallen
isaiah
after
describing
some
of
the
most
terrible
calamities
that
should
overtake
that
people
says
the
noise
of
a
multitude
in
the
mountains
like
as
of
a
great
people
a
tumultuous
noise
of
the
kingdoms
of
nations
gathered
together
the
lord
of
hosts
mustereth
the
host
of
the
battle
pangs
shall
take
hold
of
them
and
they
shall
be
in
pain
as
a
woman
that
travaileth
that
the
day
of
the
lord
cometh
cruel
both
with
wrath
and
fierce
anger
to
lay
the
land
desolate
and
shall
destroy
the
sinners
thereof
out
of
it
for
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
constellations
thereof
shall
not
give
their
light
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
in
his
going
forth
and
the
moon
shall
not
cause
her
light
to
shine
and
i
will
punish
the
world
for
their
evil
and
the
wicked
for
their
iniquity
and
i
will
cause
the
arrogancy
of
the
proud
to
cease
and
will
lay
low
the
haughtiness
of
the
terrible
i
will
make
a
man
more
precious
than
fine
gold
xiii
after
enumerating
many
other
things
concerning
babylon
and
assyria
as
types
of
things
to
come
he
says
this
is
the
purpose
that
is
purposed
upon
the
whole
earth
and
this
is
the
hand
that
is
stretched
out
upon
all
the
nations
xiv
he
says
again
behold
the
lord
maketh
the
earth
empty
and
maketh
it
waste
and
turneth
it
upside
down
and
scattereth
abroad
the
inhabitants
thereof
and
it
shall
be
as
with
the
people
so
with
the
priest
as
with
the
servant
so
with
his
master
the
land
shall
be
utterly
emptied
and
utterly
spoiled
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
this
word
the
earth
also
is
defiled
under
the
inhabitants
thereof
because
they
have
transgressed
the
laws
changed
the
ordinance
broken
the
everlasting
covenant
xxiv
from
the
above
it
would
seem
that
terrible
judgements
await
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
that
there
will
be
a
general
destruction
the
world
will
be
full
of
war
and
confusion
the
nations
of
the
earth
will
be
convulsed
and
the
wicked
hurled
out
of
it
jesus
said
when
on
the
earth
for
nation
shall
rise
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there
shall
be
famines
and
pestilences
and
earthquakes
in
divers
places
men
hearts
shall
fail
them
for
fear
of
those
things
that
are
coming
on
the
earth
jesus
came
first
as
the
babe
of
bethlehem
he
will
come
again
and
rule
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter
vessel
isaiah
says
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
jesse
and
a
branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
shall
rest
upon
him
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
shall
make
him
of
quick
understanding
in
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
he
shall
not
judge
after
the
sight
of
his
eyes
neither
reprove
after
the
hearing
of
his
ears
but
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor
and
reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
and
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
xi
the
first
of
this
was
fulfilled
when
our
saviour
came
on
this
earth
before
the
second
will
be
when
he
comes
again
he
will
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
will
he
slay
the
wicked
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
nations
and
after
rejecting
the
truth
they
will
be
left
in
darkness
to
grope
their
way
and
being
full
of
the
spirit
of
wickedness
they
will
rage
and
war
against
each
other
and
finally
after
dreadful
struggles
plagues
pestilence
famine
instigated
by
the
powers
of
darkness
there
will
be
a
great
gathering
of
the
nations
against
jerusalem
for
they
will
be
infuriated
against
its
inhabitants
and
mighty
hosts
will
assemble
so
that
they
will
be
like
a
cloud
to
cover
the
land
and
the
lord
will
appear
himself
to
the
deliverance
of
his
people
and
the
destruction
of
the
wicked
zech
xiv
let
any
one
compare
this
chapter
with
ezekiel
xxxviii
and
and
he
will
find
one
of
the
most
terrible
destructions
described
that
is
possible
to
conceive
of
and
then
turn
to
the
second
psalm
where
david
describes
the
kings
of
the
earth
taking
counsel
against
the
lord
and
against
his
anointed
he
says
he
that
sitteth
in
the
heavens
shall
laugh
the
lord
shall
have
them
in
derision
that
he
will
set
his
king
upon
his
holy
hill
in
zion
that
he
will
give
him
the
heathen
for
his
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
his
possession
that
he
will
break
them
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
dash
them
in
pieces
like
a
potter
vessel
and
then
he
concludes
by
saying
be
wise
therefore
o
ye
kings
be
instructed
ye
judges
of
the
earth
serve
the
lord
with
fear
and
rejoice
with
trembling
kiss
the
son
lest
he
be
angry
and
ye
perish
from
the
way
when
his
wrath
is
kindled
but
a
little
in
making
a
brief
summary
of
what
we
have
said
before
in
relation
to
the
means
to
be
employed
for
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
god
we
find
the
following
that
it
will
be
not
only
a
spiritual
kingdom
but
a
temporal
and
literal
one
also
that
if
it
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
must
be
revealed
from
the
heavens
that
a
standard
is
to
be
lifted
up
by
the
lord
to
the
nations
that
an
angel
is
to
come
with
the
everlasting
gospel
which
is
to
be
proclaimed
to
every
nation
kindred
people
and
tongue
that
it
is
to
be
the
same
as
the
ancient
one
and
that
the
same
powers
and
blessings
will
attend
it
that
not
only
will
the
ancient
gospel
be
preached
but
there
will
accompany
it
a
declaration
of
judgement
to
the
nations
that
there
will
be
a
literal
zion
or
gathering
of
the
saints
to
zion
as
well
as
a
gathering
of
the
jews
to
jerusalem
that
when
this
has
taken
place
the
spirit
of
god
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
nations
and
they
will
war
with
and
destroy
each
other
that
judgements
will
also
overtake
them
from
the
lord
plague
pestilence
famine
etc
that
the
nations
having
lost
the
spirit
of
god
will
assemble
to
fight
against
the
lord
people
being
full
of
the
spirit
of
unrighteousness
and
opposed
to
the
rule
and
government
of
god
that
when
they
do
the
lord
will
come
and
fight
against
them
himself
overthrow
their
armies
assert
his
own
right
rule
the
nations
with
a
rod
of
iron
root
the
wicked
out
of
the
earth
and
take
possession
of
his
own
kingdom
i
might
here
further
state
that
when
the
lord
does
come
to
exercise
judgement
upon
the
ungodly
to
make
an
end
of
sin
and
bring
in
everlasting
righteousness
he
will
establish
his
own
laws
demand
universal
obedience
and
cause
wickedness
and
misrule
to
cease
he
will
issue
his
commands
and
they
must
be
obeyed
and
if
the
nations
of
the
earth
observe
not
his
laws
they
will
have
no
rain
and
they
will
be
taught
by
more
forcible
means
than
moral
suasion
that
they
are
dependant
upon
god
for
the
lord
will
demand
obedience
and
the
scriptures
say
time
and
again
that
the
wicked
shall
be
rooted
out
of
the
land
and
the
righteous
and
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
the
lord
after
trying
man
rule
for
thousands
of
years
now
takes
the
reins
of
government
into
his
own
hands
and
makes
use
of
the
only
possible
means
of
asserting
his
rights
for
if
the
wicked
never
were
cut
off
the
righteous
never
could
rule
and
if
the
devil
was
still
suffered
to
bear
rule
god
could
not
at
the
same
time
consequently
after
long
delay
he
whose
right
it
is
takes
possession
of
the
kingdom
and
the
kingdom
and
the
greatness
of
the
kingdom
under
the
whole
heavens
shall
be
given
to
the
saints
of
the
most
high
god
and
the
world
will
assume
that
position
for
which
it
was
made
a
king
shall
rule
in
righteousness
and
princes
shall
decree
judgement
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
will
spread
and
extend
under
the
auspices
of
this
government
guided
by
his
counsels
and
under
his
direction
all
those
purposes
designed
of
him
from
the
commencement
in
relation
to
both
living
and
dead
will
be
in
a
fair
way
for
their
accomplishment
chapter
xii
the
effects
of
the
establishment
of
christ
kingdom
or
the
reign
of
god
upon
the
earth
having
said
so
much
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
we
come
to
our
last
proposition
and
enquire
what
will
be
the
effects
of
the
establishment
of
christ
kingdom
or
the
reign
of
god
on
the
earth
this
is
indeed
a
grand
and
important
question
and
requires
our
most
serious
and
calm
deliberation
if
after
all
this
distress
tribulation
war
bloodshed
and
sacrifice
of
human
life
the
condition
of
the
world
is
no
better
man
is
certainly
in
a
most
unhappy
hopeless
situation
if
it
is
nothing
more
than
some
of
the
changes
contemplated
by
man
from
one
species
of
government
to
another
and
we
must
still
have
war
bloodshed
and
disorder
and
be
subject
to
the
caprices
of
tyrants
or
the
anarchy
of
mobs
our
prospects
are
indeed
gloomy
and
our
hopes
vain
we
may
as
well
eat
and
drink
for
tomorrow
we
die
for
as
we
have
already
proven
under
the
most
improved
state
of
human
governments
we
should
still
be
subject
to
all
the
ills
which
flesh
is
heir
to
without
any
redeeming
hope
but
this
is
not
a
transient
change
it
is
something
decreed
by
god
in
relation
to
the
earth
and
man
from
before
the
commencement
of
the
world
even
the
dispossessing
of
satan
the
destruction
of
the
ungodly
and
the
reign
of
god
or
in
other
words
putting
the
moral
world
in
the
same
position
in
which
the
physical
world
is
under
the
direction
of
the
almighty
it
is
the
doing
away
with
war
bloodshed
misery
disease
and
sin
and
the
ushering
in
of
a
kingdom
of
peace
righteousness
justice
happiness
and
prosperity
it
is
the
restoration
of
the
earth
and
man
to
their
primeval
glory
and
pristine
excellence
in
fact
the
restitution
of
all
things
spoken
of
by
all
the
prophets
since
the
world
began
now
restoration
signifies
a
bringing
back
and
must
refer
to
something
which
existed
before
for
if
it
did
not
exist
before
it
could
not
be
restored
i
can
not
describe
this
better
than
parley
pratt
has
done
in
his
voice
of
warning
and
shall
therefore
make
the
following
extract
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
subjects
upon
which
the
human
mind
can
contemplate
and
one
perhaps
as
little
understood
in
the
present
age
as
any
other
now
lying
over
the
face
of
prophecy
but
however
neglected
at
the
present
time
it
was
once
the
of
the
faith
hope
and
joy
of
the
saints
it
was
a
correct
understanding
of
this
subject
and
firm
belief
in
it
that
influenced
all
their
movements
their
minds
once
fastening
upon
it
they
could
not
be
shaken
from
their
purposes
their
faith
was
firm
their
joy
constant
and
their
hope
like
an
anchor
to
the
soul
both
sure
and
stedfast
reaching
to
that
within
the
veil
it
was
this
that
enabled
them
to
rejoice
in
the
midst
of
tribulation
persecution
sword
and
flame
and
in
view
of
this
they
took
joyfully
the
spoiling
of
their
goods
and
gladly
wandered
as
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
earth
for
they
sought
a
country
a
city
and
an
inheritance
that
none
but
a
saint
ever
thought
of
understood
or
even
hoped
for
now
we
can
never
understand
precisely
what
is
meant
by
restoration
unless
we
understand
what
is
lost
or
taken
away
for
instance
when
we
offer
to
restore
any
thing
to
a
man
it
is
as
much
as
to
say
he
once
possessed
it
but
had
lost
it
and
we
propose
to
replace
or
put
him
in
possession
of
that
which
he
once
had
therefore
when
a
prophet
speaks
of
the
restoration
of
all
things
he
means
that
all
things
have
undergone
a
change
and
are
to
be
again
restored
to
their
primitive
order
even
as
they
first
existed
first
then
it
becomes
necessary
for
us
to
take
a
view
of
creation
as
it
rolled
in
purity
from
the
hand
of
its
creator
and
if
we
can
discover
the
true
state
in
which
it
then
existed
and
understand
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
since
then
we
shall
be
able
to
understand
what
is
to
be
restored
and
thus
our
minds
being
prepared
we
shall
be
looking
for
the
very
things
which
will
come
and
shall
be
in
no
danger
of
lifting
our
puny
arm
in
ignorance
to
oppose
the
things
of
god
first
then
we
will
take
a
view
of
the
earth
as
to
its
surface
local
situation
and
productions
when
god
had
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
separated
the
light
from
the
darkness
his
next
great
command
was
to
the
waters
i
god
said
let
the
waters
under
the
heaven
be
gathered
together
into
and
let
the
dry
land
appear
and
it
was
so
from
this
we
learn
a
marvellous
fact
which
very
few
have
ever
realized
or
believed
in
this
benighted
age
we
learn
that
the
waters
which
are
now
divided
into
oceans
seas
and
lakes
were
then
all
gathered
together
into
vast
ocean
and
consequently
that
the
land
which
is
now
torn
asunder
and
divided
into
continents
and
islands
almost
innumerable
was
then
vast
continent
or
body
not
separated
as
it
is
now
second
we
hear
the
lord
god
pronounce
the
earth
as
well
as
every
thing
else
very
good
from
this
we
learn
that
there
were
neither
deserts
barren
places
stagnant
swamps
rough
broken
rugged
hills
nor
vast
mountains
covered
with
eternal
snow
and
no
part
of
it
was
located
in
the
frigid
zone
so
as
to
render
its
climate
dreary
and
unproductive
subject
to
eternal
frost
or
everlasting
chains
of
ice
where
no
sweet
flowers
the
dreary
landscape
cheer
nor
plenteous
harvests
crown
the
passing
year
but
the
whole
earth
was
probably
one
vast
plain
or
interspersed
with
gently
rising
hills
and
sloping
vales
well
calculated
for
cultivation
while
its
climate
was
delightfully
varied
with
the
moderate
changes
of
heat
and
cold
of
wet
and
dry
which
only
tended
to
crown
the
varied
year
with
the
greater
variety
of
productions
all
for
the
good
of
man
animal
fowl
or
creeping
thing
while
from
the
flowery
plain
or
spicy
grove
sweet
odours
were
wafted
on
every
breeze
and
all
the
vast
creation
of
animated
being
breathed
nought
but
health
and
peace
and
joy
next
we
learn
from
i
god
said
behold
i
have
given
you
every
herb
bearing
seed
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree
in
which
is
the
fruit
of
a
tree
yielding
seed
to
you
it
shall
be
for
meat
and
to
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
to
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
to
every
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
wherein
there
is
life
i
have
given
every
green
herb
for
meat
and
it
was
so
from
these
verses
we
learn
that
the
earth
yielded
neither
nauseous
weeds
nor
poisonous
plants
nor
useless
thorns
and
thistles
indeed
every
thing
that
grew
was
just
calculated
for
the
food
of
man
beast
fowl
and
creeping
thing
and
their
food
was
all
vegetable
flesh
and
blood
were
never
sacrificed
to
glut
their
souls
or
gratify
their
appetites
the
beasts
of
the
earth
were
all
in
perfect
harmony
with
each
other
the
lion
ate
straw
like
the
ox
the
wolf
dwelt
with
the
lamb
the
leopard
lay
down
with
the
kid
the
cow
and
bear
fed
together
in
the
same
pasture
while
their
young
ones
reposed
in
perfect
security
under
the
shade
of
the
same
trees
all
was
peace
and
harmony
and
nothing
to
hurt
nor
disturb
in
all
the
holy
mountain
and
to
crown
the
whole
we
behold
man
created
in
the
image
of
god
and
exalted
in
dignity
and
power
having
dominion
over
all
the
vast
creation
of
animated
beings
which
swarmed
through
the
earth
while
at
the
same
time
he
inhabits
a
beautiful
and
garden
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
the
tree
of
life
to
which
he
had
free
access
while
he
stood
in
the
presence
of
his
maker
conversed
with
him
face
to
face
and
gazed
upon
his
glory
without
a
dimming
veil
between
o
reader
contemplate
for
a
moment
this
beautiful
creation
clothed
with
peace
and
plenty
the
earth
teeming
with
harmless
animals
rejoicing
over
all
the
plain
the
air
swarming
with
delightful
birds
whose
never
ceasing
notes
filled
the
air
with
varied
melody
and
all
in
subjection
to
their
rightful
sovereign
who
rejoiced
over
them
while
in
a
delightful
garden
the
capitol
of
creation
man
was
seated
on
the
throne
of
his
vast
empire
swaying
his
sceptre
over
all
the
earth
with
undisputed
right
while
legions
of
angels
encamped
round
about
him
and
joined
their
glad
voices
in
grateful
songs
of
praise
and
shouts
of
joy
neither
a
sigh
nor
groan
was
heard
throughout
the
vast
expanse
neither
was
there
sorrow
tears
pain
weeping
sickness
nor
death
neither
contentions
wars
nor
bloodshed
but
peace
crowned
the
seasons
as
they
rolled
and
life
joy
and
love
reigned
over
all
his
works
but
o
how
changed
the
scene
it
now
becomes
my
painful
duty
to
trace
some
of
the
important
changes
which
have
taken
place
and
the
causes
which
have
conspired
to
reduce
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
to
their
present
state
first
man
fell
from
his
standing
before
god
by
giving
heed
to
temptation
and
this
fall
affected
the
whole
creation
as
well
as
man
and
caused
various
changes
to
take
place
he
was
banished
from
the
presence
of
his
creator
and
a
veil
was
drawn
between
them
and
he
was
driven
from
the
garden
of
eden
to
till
the
earth
which
was
then
cursed
for
man
sake
and
should
begin
to
bring
forth
thorns
and
thistles
and
with
the
sweat
of
his
face
he
should
earn
his
bread
and
in
sorrow
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
his
life
and
finally
return
to
dust
but
as
to
eve
her
curse
was
a
great
multiplicity
of
sorrow
and
conception
and
between
her
seed
and
the
seed
of
the
serpent
there
was
to
be
a
constant
enmity
it
should
bruise
the
serpent
head
and
the
serpent
should
bruise
his
heel
now
reader
contemplate
the
change
this
scene
which
was
so
beautiful
a
little
before
had
now
become
the
abode
of
sorrow
and
toil
of
death
and
mourning
the
earth
groaning
with
its
production
of
accursed
thorns
and
thistles
man
and
beast
at
enmity
the
serpent
slily
creeping
away
fearing
lest
his
head
should
got
the
deadly
bruise
and
man
startling
amid
the
thorny
path
in
fear
lest
the
serpent
fangs
should
pierce
his
heel
while
the
lamb
yields
his
blood
upon
the
smoking
altar
soon
man
begins
to
persecute
hate
and
murder
his
fellow
until
at
length
the
earth
is
filled
with
violence
all
flesh
becomes
corrupt
the
powers
of
darkness
prevail
and
it
repented
noah
that
god
had
made
man
and
it
grieved
him
at
his
heart
because
the
lord
should
come
out
in
vengeance
and
cleanse
the
earth
by
water
how
far
the
flood
may
have
contributed
to
produce
the
various
changes
as
to
the
division
of
the
earth
into
broken
fragments
islands
and
continents
mountains
and
valleys
we
have
not
been
informed
the
change
must
have
been
considerable
but
after
the
flood
in
the
days
of
peleg
the
earth
was
see
x
a
short
history
to
be
sure
of
so
great
an
event
but
still
it
will
account
for
the
mighty
revolution
which
rolled
the
sea
from
its
own
place
in
the
north
and
brought
it
to
interpose
between
different
portions
of
the
earth
which
were
thus
parted
asunder
and
moved
into
something
near
their
present
form
this
together
with
the
earthquakes
revolutions
and
commotions
which
have
since
taken
place
have
all
contributed
to
reduce
the
face
of
the
earth
to
its
present
state
while
the
great
curses
which
have
fallen
upon
different
portions
because
of
the
wickedness
of
men
will
account
for
the
stagnant
swamps
the
sunken
lakes
the
dead
seas
and
great
deserts
witness
for
instance
the
denunciations
of
the
prophets
upon
babylon
how
it
was
to
become
perpetual
desolations
a
den
of
wild
beasts
a
dwelling
of
unclean
and
hateful
birds
a
place
for
owls
and
should
never
be
inhabited
but
should
lie
desolate
from
generation
to
generation
witness
also
the
plains
of
sodom
filled
with
towns
cities
and
flourishing
gardens
well
watered
but
o
how
changed
a
vast
sea
of
stagnant
water
alone
marks
the
place
witness
the
land
of
palestine
in
the
days
of
solomon
it
was
capable
of
sustaining
millions
of
people
besides
a
surplus
of
wheat
and
other
productions
which
were
exchanged
with
the
neighbouring
nations
whereas
now
it
is
desolate
and
hardly
capable
of
sustaining
a
few
miserable
inhabitants
and
when
i
cast
mine
eyes
over
our
own
land
and
see
the
numerous
swamps
lakes
and
ponds
of
stagnant
waters
together
with
the
vast
mountains
and
innumerable
rough
places
rocks
having
been
rent
and
torn
asunder
from
centre
to
circumference
i
exclaim
whence
all
this
when
i
read
the
book
of
mormon
it
informs
me
that
while
christ
was
crucified
among
the
jews
this
whole
american
continent
was
shaken
to
its
foundation
that
many
cities
were
sunk
and
waters
came
up
in
their
places
that
the
rocks
were
all
rent
in
twain
that
mountains
were
thrown
up
to
an
exceeding
height
and
other
mountains
became
vallies
the
level
roads
spoiled
and
the
whole
face
of
the
land
i
then
exclaim
these
things
are
no
longer
a
mystery
i
have
now
learned
to
account
for
the
many
wonders
which
i
everywhere
behold
throughout
our
whole
country
when
i
am
passing
a
ledge
of
rocks
and
see
they
have
all
been
rent
and
torn
asunder
while
some
huge
fragments
are
found
deeply
imbedded
in
the
earth
some
rods
from
whence
they
were
torn
i
exclaim
with
astonishment
these
were
the
groans
the
convulsive
throes
of
agonizing
nature
while
the
son
of
god
suffered
upon
the
cross
but
men
have
degenerated
and
greatly
changed
as
well
as
the
earth
the
sins
the
abominations
and
the
many
evil
habits
of
the
latter
ages
have
added
to
the
miseries
toils
and
sufferings
of
human
life
the
idleness
extravagance
pride
covetousness
drunkenness
and
other
abominations
which
are
characteristics
of
the
latter
times
have
all
combined
to
sink
mankind
to
the
lowest
state
of
wretchedness
and
degradation
while
priestcraft
and
false
doctrines
have
greatly
tended
to
lull
mankind
to
sleep
and
caused
them
to
rest
infinitely
short
of
the
powers
and
attainments
which
the
ancients
did
enjoy
and
which
are
alone
calculated
to
exalt
the
intellectual
powers
of
the
human
mind
to
establish
noble
and
generous
sentiments
to
enlarge
the
heart
and
to
expand
the
soul
to
the
utmost
extent
of
its
capacity
witness
the
ancients
conversing
with
the
great
jehovah
learning
lessons
from
the
angels
and
receiving
instruction
by
the
holy
ghost
in
dreams
by
night
and
visions
by
day
until
at
length
the
veil
is
taken
off
and
they
permitted
to
gaze
with
wonder
and
admiration
upon
all
things
past
and
future
yea
even
to
soar
aloft
amid
unnumbered
worlds
while
the
vast
expanse
of
eternity
stands
open
before
them
and
they
contemplate
the
mighty
works
of
the
great
i
am
until
they
know
as
they
are
known
and
see
as
they
are
seen
compare
this
intelligence
with
the
low
smatterings
of
education
and
worldly
wisdom
which
seem
to
satisfy
the
narrow
mind
of
man
in
our
generation
yea
behold
the
calculating
trading
overreaching
penurious
sycophant
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
dreams
of
nothing
here
but
how
to
increase
his
goods
or
take
advantage
of
his
neighbour
and
whose
only
religious
exercises
or
duties
consist
of
going
to
meeting
paying
the
priest
his
hire
or
praying
to
his
god
without
expecting
to
be
heard
or
answered
supposing
that
god
has
been
deaf
and
dumb
for
many
centuries
or
altogether
stupid
and
indifferent
like
himself
and
having
seen
the
two
contrasted
you
will
be
able
to
form
some
idea
of
the
vast
elevation
from
which
man
has
fallen
you
will
also
learn
how
infinitely
beneath
his
former
glory
and
dignity
he
is
now
living
and
your
heart
will
mourn
and
be
exceedingly
sorrowful
when
you
contemplate
him
in
his
low
estate
and
then
think
he
is
your
brother
and
you
will
be
ready
to
exclaim
with
wonder
and
astonishment
o
man
how
art
thou
fallen
once
thou
wast
the
favourite
of
heaven
thy
maker
delighted
to
converse
with
thee
and
angels
and
the
spirits
of
just
men
made
perfect
were
thy
companions
but
now
thou
art
degraded
and
brought
down
on
a
level
with
the
beasts
yea
far
beneath
them
for
they
look
with
horror
and
affright
at
your
vain
amusements
your
sports
and
your
drunkenness
and
thus
often
set
an
example
worthy
of
your
imitation
well
did
the
apostle
peter
say
of
you
that
you
know
nothing
only
what
you
know
naturally
as
brute
beasts
made
to
be
taken
and
destroyed
and
thus
you
perish
from
generation
to
generation
while
all
creation
groans
under
its
pollution
and
sorrow
and
death
mourning
and
weeping
fill
up
the
measure
of
the
days
of
man
but
o
my
soul
dwell
no
longer
on
this
awful
scene
let
it
suffice
to
have
discovered
in
some
degree
what
is
lost
let
us
turn
our
attention
to
what
the
prophets
have
said
should
be
restored
the
apostle
peter
while
preaching
to
the
jews
says
he
shall
send
jesus
christ
which
before
was
preached
unto
you
whom
the
heavens
must
receive
until
the
times
of
restitution
restoration
of
all
things
which
god
hath
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
holy
prophets
since
the
world
began
it
appears
from
the
above
that
all
the
holy
prophets
from
adam
and
those
that
follow
after
have
had
their
eyes
upon
a
certain
time
when
all
things
should
be
restored
to
their
primitive
beauty
and
excellence
we
also
learn
that
the
time
of
restitution
was
to
be
at
or
near
the
time
of
christ
second
coming
for
the
heavens
are
to
receive
him
until
the
times
of
restitution
and
then
the
father
shall
send
him
again
to
the
earth
we
will
now
proceed
to
notice
isaiah
xl
ye
comfort
ye
my
people
saith
your
god
speak
ye
comfortably
to
jerusalem
and
cry
unto
her
that
her
warfare
is
accomplished
that
her
iniquity
is
pardoned
for
she
hath
received
of
the
lord
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
the
voice
of
him
that
crieth
in
the
wilderness
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
lord
make
straight
in
the
desert
a
highway
for
our
god
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
the
rough
places
plain
and
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
from
these
verses
we
learn
first
that
the
voice
of
one
shall
be
heard
in
the
wilderness
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
just
at
the
time
when
jerusalem
has
been
trodden
down
of
the
gentiles
long
enough
to
have
received
at
the
lord
hand
double
for
all
her
sins
yea
when
the
warfare
of
jerusalem
is
accomplished
and
her
iniquities
pardoned
then
shall
this
proclamation
be
made
as
it
was
before
by
john
yea
a
second
proclamation
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
for
his
second
coming
and
about
that
time
every
valley
shall
be
exalted
and
every
mountain
and
hill
shall
be
made
low
and
the
crooked
shall
be
made
straight
and
rough
places
plain
and
then
the
glory
of
the
lord
shall
be
revealed
and
all
flesh
shall
see
it
together
for
the
mouth
of
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
thus
you
see
every
mountain
being
laid
low
and
every
valley
exalted
and
the
rough
places
being
made
plain
and
the
crooked
places
straight
that
these
mighty
revolutions
will
begin
to
restore
the
face
of
the
earth
to
its
former
beauty
but
all
this
done
we
have
not
yet
gone
through
our
restoration
there
are
many
more
great
things
to
be
done
in
order
to
restore
all
things
our
next
is
isaiah
chapter
where
we
again
read
of
the
second
coming
and
of
the
mighty
works
which
attend
it
the
barren
desert
should
abound
with
pools
and
springs
of
living
water
and
should
produce
grass
with
flowers
blooming
and
blossoming
as
the
rose
and
that
too
about
the
time
of
the
coming
of
their
god
with
vengeance
and
recompense
which
must
allude
to
his
second
coming
and
israel
is
to
come
at
the
same
time
to
zion
with
songs
of
everlasting
joy
and
sorrow
and
sighing
shall
flee
away
here
then
we
have
the
curse
taken
off
from
the
deserts
and
they
become
a
fruitful
country
we
will
now
inquire
whether
the
islands
return
again
to
the
continents
from
which
they
were
once
separated
for
this
subject
we
refer
you
to
revelation
vi
every
mountain
and
island
were
moved
out
of
their
places
from
this
we
learn
that
they
moved
somewhere
and
as
it
is
the
time
of
restoring
what
had
been
lost
they
accordingly
return
and
join
themselves
to
the
land
whence
they
came
our
next
is
isaiah
xiii
where
earth
shall
move
out
of
her
place
and
be
like
a
chased
roe
which
no
man
taketh
up
also
isaiah
lxii
shalt
no
more
be
termed
forsaken
neither
shall
thy
land
any
more
be
termed
desolate
but
thou
shalt
be
called
hephzibah
and
thy
land
beulah
for
the
lord
delighteth
in
thee
and
thy
land
shall
be
married
in
the
first
instance
we
have
the
earth
on
a
move
like
a
chased
roe
and
in
the
second
place
we
have
it
married
and
from
the
whole
and
various
scriptures
we
learn
that
the
continents
and
islands
shall
be
united
in
one
as
they
were
on
the
morn
of
creation
and
the
sea
shall
retire
and
assemble
in
its
own
place
where
it
was
before
and
all
these
scenes
shall
take
place
during
the
mighty
convulsion
of
nature
about
the
time
of
the
coming
of
the
lord
behold
the
mount
of
olives
rend
in
twain
while
on
its
top
he
sets
his
feet
again
the
islands
at
his
word
obedient
flee
while
to
the
north
he
rolls
the
mighty
sea
restores
the
earth
in
one
as
at
the
first
with
all
its
blessings
and
removes
the
curse
having
restored
the
earth
to
the
same
glorious
state
in
which
it
first
existed
levelling
the
mountains
exalting
the
valleys
smoothing
the
rough
places
making
the
deserts
fruitful
and
bringing
all
the
continents
and
islands
together
causing
the
curse
to
be
taken
off
that
it
shall
no
longer
produce
noxious
weeds
and
thorns
and
thistles
the
next
thing
is
to
regulate
and
restore
the
brute
creation
to
their
former
state
of
peace
and
glory
causing
all
enmity
to
cease
from
off
the
earth
but
this
will
never
be
done
until
there
is
a
general
destruction
poured
out
upon
man
which
will
entirely
cleanse
the
earth
and
sweep
all
wickedness
from
its
face
this
will
be
done
by
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
by
the
breath
of
his
lips
or
in
other
words
by
fire
as
universal
as
the
flood
isaiah
xi
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor
and
reprove
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
the
wolf
also
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
and
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down
together
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox
and
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrice
den
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
lord
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
thus
having
cleansed
the
earth
and
glorified
it
with
the
knowledge
of
god
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
and
having
poured
out
his
spirit
upon
all
flesh
both
man
and
beast
becoming
perfectly
harmless
as
they
were
in
the
beginning
and
feeding
on
vegetable
food
only
while
nothing
is
left
to
hurt
or
destroy
in
all
the
vast
creation
the
prophets
then
proceed
to
give
us
many
glorious
descriptions
of
the
enjoyments
of
its
inhabitants
shall
build
houses
and
inhabit
them
they
shall
plant
vineyards
and
drink
the
wine
of
them
they
shall
plant
gardens
and
eat
the
fruit
of
them
they
shall
not
build
and
another
inhabit
they
shall
not
plant
and
another
eat
for
as
the
days
of
a
tree
are
the
days
of
my
people
and
mine
elect
shall
long
enjoy
the
work
of
their
hands
they
shall
not
labour
in
vain
nor
bring
forth
in
trouble
for
they
are
the
seed
of
the
blessed
of
the
lord
and
their
offspring
with
them
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
before
they
call
i
will
answer
and
while
they
are
yet
speaking
i
will
hear
in
this
happy
state
of
existence
it
seems
that
all
people
will
live
to
the
full
age
of
a
tree
and
this
too
without
pain
or
sorrow
and
whatsoever
they
ask
will
be
immediately
answered
and
even
all
their
wants
will
be
anticipated
of
course
then
none
of
them
will
sleep
in
the
dust
for
they
will
prefer
to
be
translated
that
is
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
from
mortal
to
immortal
after
which
they
will
continue
to
reign
with
jesus
on
the
earth
pp
a
great
council
will
then
be
held
to
adjust
the
affairs
of
the
world
from
the
commencement
over
which
father
adam
will
preside
as
head
and
representative
of
the
human
family
there
have
been
in
different
ages
of
the
world
communications
opened
between
the
heavens
and
the
earth
those
powers
have
been
separated
and
have
acted
in
different
spheres
until
the
present
the
kingdom
of
god
on
the
earth
has
been
small
weak
unpopular
trampled
under
foot
of
men
and
none
but
men
of
noble
minds
firm
hopes
and
daring
resolution
have
advocated
its
principles
these
men
being
possessed
of
intelligence
from
the
heavens
by
the
ministering
of
angels
the
communications
of
the
spirits
of
the
just
and
the
manifestation
of
eternal
things
knew
of
the
approaching
day
of
glory
the
reign
of
god
on
the
earth
they
understood
their
destiny
and
lived
and
died
in
the
hopes
of
inheriting
these
things
those
communications
from
the
heavens
developd
the
purposes
of
god
to
them
and
in
all
their
moves
they
were
regulated
by
the
prospect
of
the
future
in
the
mosaic
dispensation
they
had
to
make
earthly
things
according
to
the
pattern
of
heavenly
hence
it
was
said
to
moses
see
that
thou
make
all
things
according
to
the
pattern
shewn
thee
in
the
mount
the
ark
was
made
therefore
after
a
heavenly
pattern
and
so
was
the
temple
of
jerusalem
jerusalem
was
a
figure
of
the
heavenly
the
sacrifices
of
the
aaronic
priesthood
referred
to
the
expiation
of
christ
who
appears
as
the
earthly
high
priest
of
the
jews
and
as
our
eternal
high
priest
and
intercessor
in
the
heavens
his
priesthood
was
an
eternal
one
and
is
after
the
order
of
melchisedek
and
melchisedek
was
after
his
order
and
they
both
were
after
the
order
that
exists
in
the
heavens
this
priesthood
with
the
gospel
brought
life
and
immortality
to
light
put
men
in
possession
of
certainty
and
unveiled
the
future
they
knew
the
divine
laws
and
ordinances
and
acted
with
a
reference
to
them
and
being
commissioned
of
god
they
had
power
to
bind
and
loose
etc
then
they
will
assemble
to
regulate
all
these
affairs
and
all
that
held
keys
of
authority
to
administer
will
then
represent
their
earthly
course
and
as
this
authority
has
been
handed
down
from
one
to
another
in
different
ages
and
in
different
dispensations
a
full
reckoning
will
have
to
be
made
by
all
all
who
have
held
keys
of
priesthood
will
then
have
to
give
an
account
to
those
from
whom
they
received
them
those
that
were
in
the
heavens
have
been
assisting
those
that
were
upon
the
earth
but
then
they
will
unite
together
in
a
general
council
to
give
an
account
of
their
stewardships
and
as
in
the
various
ages
men
have
received
their
power
to
administer
from
those
who
had
previously
held
the
keys
thereof
there
will
be
a
general
account
those
under
the
authorities
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
have
to
give
an
account
of
their
transactions
to
those
who
direct
them
in
the
priesthood
hence
the
elders
give
an
account
to
presidents
of
conferences
and
presidents
of
conferences
to
presidents
of
nations
those
presidents
and
the
seventies
give
an
account
to
the
twelve
apostles
the
twelve
to
the
first
presidency
and
they
to
joseph
from
whom
they
and
the
twelve
received
their
priesthood
this
will
include
the
arrangements
of
the
last
dispensation
joseph
delivers
his
authority
to
peter
who
held
the
keys
before
him
and
delivered
them
to
him
and
peter
to
moses
and
elias
who
endued
him
with
this
authority
on
the
mount
and
they
to
those
from
whom
they
received
them
and
thus
the
world
affairs
will
be
regulated
and
put
right
the
restitution
of
all
things
be
accomplished
and
the
kingdom
of
god
be
ushered
in
the
earth
will
be
delivered
from
under
the
curse
resume
its
paradisiacal
glory
and
all
things
pertaining
to
its
restoration
be
fulfilled
not
only
will
the
earth
be
restored
but
also
man
and
those
promises
which
long
ago
were
the
hope
of
the
saints
will
be
realised
the
faithful
servants
of
god
who
have
lived
in
every
age
will
then
come
forth
and
experience
the
full
fruition
of
that
joy
for
which
they
lived
and
hoped
and
suffered
and
died
the
tombs
will
deliver
up
their
captives
and
with
the
spirits
which
once
animated
vivified
cheered
and
sustained
them
while
in
this
vale
of
tears
these
bodies
will
be
like
unto
christ
glorious
body
they
will
then
rejoice
in
that
resurrection
for
which
they
lived
while
they
sojourned
below
adam
seth
enoch
and
the
faithful
who
lived
before
the
flood
will
possess
their
proper
inheritance
noah
and
melchisedek
will
stand
in
their
proper
places
abraham
with
isaac
and
jacob
heirs
with
him
of
the
same
promise
will
come
forward
at
the
head
of
innumerable
multitudes
and
possess
that
land
which
god
gave
unto
them
for
an
everlasting
inheritance
the
faithful
on
the
continent
of
america
will
also
stand
in
their
proper
place
but
as
this
will
be
the
time
of
the
restitution
of
all
things
and
all
things
will
not
be
fully
restored
at
once
there
will
be
a
distinction
between
the
resurrected
bodies
and
those
that
have
not
been
resurrected
and
as
the
scriptures
say
that
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
neither
doth
corruption
inherit
incorruption
and
although
the
world
will
enjoy
just
laws
an
equitable
administration
and
universal
peace
and
happiness
prevail
as
the
result
of
this
righteousness
yet
there
will
be
a
peculiar
habitation
for
the
resurrected
bodies
this
habitation
may
be
compared
to
paradise
from
whence
man
in
the
beginning
was
driven
when
adam
was
driven
from
the
garden
an
angel
was
placed
with
a
naming
sword
to
guard
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life
lest
man
should
eat
of
it
and
become
immortal
in
his
degenerate
state
and
thus
be
incapable
of
obtaining
that
exaltation
which
he
would
be
capable
of
enjoying
through
the
redemption
of
jesus
christ
and
the
power
of
the
resurrection
with
his
renewed
and
glorified
body
having
tasted
of
the
nature
of
the
fall
and
having
grappled
with
sin
and
misery
knowing
like
the
gods
both
good
and
evil
having
like
jesus
overcome
the
evil
and
through
the
power
of
the
atonement
having
conquered
death
hell
and
the
grave
he
regains
that
paradise
from
which
he
was
banished
not
in
the
capacity
of
ignorant
man
unacquinted
with
evil
but
like
unto
a
god
he
can
now
stretch
forth
and
partake
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
of
its
fruits
and
live
and
flourish
eternally
in
possession
of
that
immortality
which
jesus
long
ago
promised
to
the
faithful
to
him
that
overcomes
will
i
grant
to
sit
with
me
in
my
throne
and
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
which
is
in
the
midst
of
the
paradise
of
god
