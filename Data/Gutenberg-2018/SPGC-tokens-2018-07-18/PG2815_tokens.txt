democracy
an
american
novel
by
henry
adams
first
published
anonymously
march
and
soon
in
various
unauthorized
editions
it
was
until
the
edition
that
adams
was
listed
as
author
henry
adams
remarked
ironically
as
usual
the
wholesale
piracy
of
democracy
was
the
single
real
triumph
of
my
it
was
very
popular
as
readers
tried
to
guess
who
the
author
was
and
who
the
characters
really
were
chapters
xii
and
xiii
were
originally
misnumbered
chapter
i
for
reasons
which
many
persons
thought
ridiculous
lightfoot
lee
decided
to
pass
the
winter
in
washington
she
was
in
excellent
health
but
she
said
that
the
climate
would
do
her
good
in
new
york
she
had
troops
of
friends
but
she
suddenly
became
eager
to
see
again
the
very
small
number
of
those
who
lived
on
the
potomac
it
was
only
to
her
closest
intimates
that
she
honestly
acknowledged
herself
to
be
tortured
by
ennui
since
her
husband
death
five
years
before
she
had
lost
her
taste
for
new
york
society
she
had
felt
no
interest
in
the
price
of
stocks
and
very
little
in
the
men
who
dealt
in
them
she
had
become
serious
what
was
it
all
worth
this
wilderness
of
men
and
women
as
monotonous
as
the
brown
stone
houses
they
lived
in
in
her
despair
she
had
resorted
to
desperate
measures
she
had
read
philosophy
in
the
original
german
and
the
more
she
read
the
more
she
was
disheartened
that
so
much
culture
should
lead
to
nothing
nothing
after
talking
of
herbert
spencer
for
an
entire
evening
with
a
very
literary
transcendental
she
could
not
see
that
her
time
had
been
better
employed
than
when
in
former
days
she
had
passed
it
in
flirting
with
a
very
agreeable
young
indeed
there
was
an
evident
proof
to
the
contrary
for
the
flirtation
might
lead
to
something
had
in
fact
led
to
marriage
while
the
philosophy
could
lead
to
nothing
unless
it
were
perhaps
to
another
evening
of
the
same
kind
because
transcendental
philosophers
are
mostly
elderly
men
usually
married
and
when
engaged
in
business
somewhat
apt
to
be
sleepy
towards
evening
nevertheless
lee
did
her
best
to
turn
her
study
to
practical
use
she
plunged
into
philanthropy
visited
prisons
inspected
hospitals
read
the
literature
of
pauperism
and
crime
saturated
herself
with
the
statistics
of
vice
until
her
mind
had
nearly
lost
sight
of
virtue
at
last
it
rose
in
rebellion
against
her
and
she
came
to
the
limit
of
her
strength
this
path
too
seemed
to
lead
nowhere
she
declared
that
she
had
lost
the
sense
of
duty
and
that
so
far
as
concerned
her
all
the
paupers
and
criminals
in
new
york
might
henceforward
rise
in
their
majesty
and
manage
every
railway
on
the
continent
why
should
she
care
what
was
the
city
to
her
she
could
find
nothing
in
it
that
seemed
to
demand
salvation
what
gave
peculiar
sanctity
to
numbers
why
were
a
million
people
who
all
resembled
each
other
any
way
more
interesting
than
one
person
what
aspiration
could
she
help
to
put
into
the
mind
of
this
great
monster
that
would
make
it
worth
her
love
or
respect
religion
a
thousand
powerful
churches
were
doing
their
best
and
she
could
see
no
chance
for
a
new
faith
of
which
she
was
to
be
the
inspired
prophet
ambition
high
popular
ideals
passion
for
whatever
is
lofty
and
pure
the
very
words
irritated
her
was
she
not
herself
devoured
by
ambition
and
was
she
not
now
eating
her
heart
out
because
she
could
find
no
one
object
worth
a
sacrifice
was
it
ambition
real
ambition
or
was
it
mere
restlessness
that
made
lightfoot
lee
so
bitter
against
new
york
and
philadelphia
baltimore
and
boston
american
life
in
general
and
all
life
in
particular
what
did
she
want
not
social
position
for
she
herself
was
an
eminently
respectable
philadelphian
by
birth
her
father
a
famous
clergyman
and
her
husband
had
been
equally
irreproachable
a
descendant
of
one
branch
of
the
virginia
lees
which
had
drifted
to
new
york
in
search
of
fortune
and
had
found
it
or
enough
of
it
to
keep
the
young
man
there
his
widow
had
her
own
place
in
society
which
no
one
disputed
though
not
brighter
than
her
neighbours
the
world
persisted
in
classing
her
among
clever
women
she
had
wealth
or
at
least
enough
of
it
to
give
her
all
that
money
can
give
by
way
of
pleasure
to
a
sensible
woman
in
an
american
city
she
had
her
house
and
her
carriage
she
dressed
well
her
table
was
good
and
her
furniture
was
never
allowed
to
fall
behind
the
latest
standard
of
decorative
art
she
had
travelled
in
europe
and
after
several
visits
covering
some
years
of
time
had
returned
home
carrying
in
one
hand
as
it
were
a
landscape
a
remarkably
pleasing
specimen
of
corot
and
in
the
other
some
bales
of
persian
and
syrian
rugs
and
embroideries
japanese
bronzes
and
porcelain
with
this
she
declared
europe
to
be
exhausted
and
she
frankly
avowed
that
she
was
american
to
the
tips
of
her
fingers
she
neither
knew
nor
greatly
cared
whether
america
or
europe
were
best
to
live
in
she
had
no
violent
love
for
either
and
she
had
no
objection
to
abusing
both
but
she
meant
to
get
all
that
american
life
had
to
offer
good
or
bad
and
to
drink
it
down
to
the
dregs
fully
determined
that
whatever
there
was
in
it
she
would
have
and
that
whatever
could
be
made
out
of
it
she
would
manufacture
i
know
said
she
that
america
produces
petroleum
and
pigs
i
have
seen
both
on
the
steamers
and
i
am
told
it
produces
silver
and
gold
there
is
choice
enough
for
any
yet
as
has
been
already
said
lee
first
experience
was
not
a
success
she
soon
declared
that
new
york
might
represent
the
petroleum
or
the
pigs
but
the
gold
of
life
was
not
to
be
discovered
there
by
her
eyes
not
but
that
there
was
variety
enough
a
variety
of
people
occupations
aims
and
thoughts
but
that
all
these
after
growing
to
a
certain
height
stopped
short
they
found
nothing
to
hold
them
up
she
knew
more
or
less
intimately
a
dozen
men
whose
fortunes
ranged
between
one
million
and
forty
millions
what
did
they
do
with
their
money
what
could
they
do
with
it
that
was
different
from
what
other
men
did
after
all
it
is
absurd
to
spend
more
money
than
is
enough
to
satisfy
all
one
wants
it
is
vulgar
to
live
in
two
houses
in
the
same
street
and
to
drive
six
horses
abreast
yet
after
setting
aside
a
certain
income
sufficient
for
all
one
wants
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
rest
to
let
it
accumulate
was
to
own
one
failure
lee
great
grievance
was
that
it
did
accumulate
without
changing
or
improving
the
quality
of
its
owners
to
spend
it
in
charity
and
public
works
was
doubtless
praiseworthy
but
was
it
wise
lee
had
read
enough
political
economy
and
pauper
reports
to
be
nearly
convinced
that
public
work
should
be
public
duty
and
that
great
benefactions
do
harm
as
well
as
good
and
even
supposing
it
spent
on
these
objects
how
could
it
do
more
than
increase
and
perpetuate
that
same
kind
of
human
nature
which
was
her
great
grievance
her
new
york
friends
could
not
meet
this
question
except
by
falling
back
upon
their
native
commonplaces
which
she
recklessly
trampled
upon
averring
that
much
as
she
admired
the
genius
of
the
famous
traveller
gulliver
she
never
had
been
able
since
she
became
a
widow
to
accept
the
brobdingnagian
doctrine
that
he
who
made
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
only
one
grew
before
deserved
better
of
mankind
than
the
whole
race
of
politicians
she
would
not
find
fault
with
the
philosopher
had
he
required
that
the
grass
should
be
of
an
improved
quality
but
said
she
i
can
not
honestly
pretend
that
i
should
be
pleased
to
see
two
new
york
men
where
i
now
see
one
the
idea
is
too
ridiculous
more
than
one
and
a
half
would
be
fatal
to
then
came
her
boston
friends
who
suggested
that
higher
education
was
precisely
what
she
wanted
she
should
throw
herself
into
a
crusade
for
universities
and
lee
turned
upon
them
with
a
sweet
smile
do
you
know
said
she
that
we
have
in
new
york
already
the
richest
university
in
america
and
that
its
only
trouble
has
always
been
that
it
can
get
no
scholars
even
by
paying
for
them
do
you
want
me
to
go
out
into
the
streets
and
waylay
boys
if
the
heathen
refuse
to
be
converted
can
you
give
me
power
over
the
stake
and
the
sword
to
compel
them
to
come
in
and
suppose
you
can
suppose
i
march
all
the
boys
in
fifth
avenue
down
to
the
university
and
have
them
all
properly
taught
greek
and
latin
english
literature
ethics
and
german
philosophy
what
then
you
do
it
in
boston
now
tell
me
honestly
what
comes
of
it
i
suppose
you
have
there
a
brilliant
society
numbers
of
poets
scholars
philosophers
statesmen
all
up
and
down
beacon
street
your
evenings
must
be
sparkling
your
press
must
scintillate
how
is
it
that
we
new
yorkers
never
hear
of
it
we
do
go
much
into
your
society
but
when
we
do
it
does
seem
so
very
much
better
than
our
own
you
are
just
like
the
rest
of
us
you
grow
six
inches
high
and
then
you
stop
why
will
not
somebody
grow
to
be
a
tree
and
cast
a
shadow
the
average
member
of
new
york
society
although
not
unused
to
this
contemptuous
kind
of
treatment
from
his
leaders
retaliated
in
his
blind
way
what
does
the
woman
want
he
said
is
her
head
turned
with
the
tulieries
and
marlborough
house
does
she
think
herself
made
for
a
throne
why
does
she
not
lecture
for
women
rights
why
not
go
on
the
stage
if
she
can
not
be
contented
like
other
people
what
need
is
there
for
abusing
us
just
because
she
feels
herself
no
taller
than
we
are
what
does
she
expect
to
get
from
her
sharp
tongue
what
does
she
know
any
way
lee
certainly
knew
very
little
she
had
read
voraciously
and
promiscuously
one
subject
after
another
ruskin
and
taine
had
danced
merrily
through
her
mind
hand
in
hand
with
darwin
and
stuart
mill
gustave
droz
and
algernon
swinburne
she
had
even
laboured
over
the
literature
of
her
own
country
she
was
perhaps
the
only
woman
in
new
york
who
knew
something
of
american
history
certainly
she
could
not
have
repeated
the
list
of
presidents
in
their
order
but
she
knew
that
the
constitution
divided
the
government
into
executive
legislative
and
judiciary
she
was
aware
that
the
president
the
speaker
and
the
chief
justice
were
important
personages
and
instinctively
she
wondered
whether
they
might
not
solve
her
problem
whether
they
were
the
shade
trees
which
she
saw
in
her
dreams
here
then
was
the
explanation
of
her
restlessness
discontent
ambition
call
it
what
you
will
it
was
the
feeling
of
a
passenger
on
an
ocean
steamer
whose
mind
will
not
give
him
rest
until
he
has
been
in
the
and
talked
with
the
engineer
she
wanted
to
see
with
her
own
eyes
the
action
of
primary
forces
to
touch
with
her
own
hand
the
massive
machinery
of
society
to
measure
with
her
own
mind
the
capacity
of
the
motive
power
she
was
bent
upon
getting
to
the
heart
of
the
great
american
mystery
of
democracy
and
government
she
cared
little
where
her
pursuit
might
lead
her
for
she
put
no
extravagant
value
upon
life
having
already
as
she
said
exhausted
at
least
two
lives
and
being
fairly
hardened
to
insensibility
in
the
process
to
lose
a
husband
and
a
baby
said
she
and
keep
one
courage
and
reason
one
must
become
very
hard
or
very
soft
i
am
now
pure
steel
you
may
beat
my
heart
with
a
and
it
will
beat
the
back
perhaps
after
exhausting
the
political
world
she
might
try
again
elsewhere
she
did
not
pretend
to
say
where
she
might
then
go
or
what
she
should
do
but
at
present
she
meant
to
see
what
amusement
there
might
be
in
politics
her
friends
asked
what
kind
of
amusement
she
expected
to
find
among
the
illiterate
swarm
of
ordinary
people
who
in
washington
represented
constituencies
so
dreary
that
in
comparison
new
york
was
a
new
jerusalem
and
broad
street
a
grove
of
academe
she
replied
that
if
washington
society
were
so
bad
as
this
she
should
have
gained
all
she
wanted
for
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
return
precisely
the
feeling
she
longed
for
in
her
own
mind
however
she
frowned
on
the
idea
of
seeking
for
men
what
she
wished
to
see
she
thought
was
the
clash
of
interests
the
interests
of
forty
millions
of
people
and
a
whole
continent
centering
at
washington
guided
restrained
controlled
or
unrestrained
and
uncontrollable
by
men
of
ordinary
mould
the
tremendous
forces
of
government
and
the
machinery
of
society
at
work
what
she
wanted
was
power
perhaps
the
force
of
the
engine
was
a
little
confused
in
her
mind
with
that
of
the
engineer
the
power
with
the
men
who
wielded
it
perhaps
the
human
interest
of
politics
was
after
all
what
really
attracted
her
and
however
strongly
she
might
deny
it
the
passion
for
exercising
power
for
its
own
sake
might
dazzle
and
mislead
a
woman
who
had
exhausted
all
the
ordinary
feminine
resources
but
why
speculate
about
her
motives
the
stage
was
before
her
the
curtain
was
rising
the
actors
were
ready
to
enter
she
had
only
to
go
quietly
on
among
the
supernumeraries
and
see
how
the
play
was
acted
and
the
stage
effects
were
produced
how
the
great
tragedians
mouthed
and
the
swore
chapter
ii
on
the
first
of
december
lee
took
the
train
for
washington
and
before
five
that
evening
she
was
entering
her
newly
hired
house
on
lafayette
square
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
mingled
expression
of
contempt
and
grief
at
the
curious
barbarism
of
the
curtains
and
the
and
her
next
two
days
were
occupied
with
a
struggle
to
get
the
mastery
over
her
surroundings
in
this
awful
contest
the
interior
of
the
doomed
house
suffered
as
though
a
demon
were
in
it
not
a
chair
not
a
mirror
not
a
carpet
was
left
untouched
and
in
the
midst
of
the
worst
confusion
the
new
mistress
sat
calm
as
the
statue
of
andrew
jackson
in
the
square
under
her
eyes
and
issued
her
orders
with
as
much
decision
as
that
hero
had
ever
shown
towards
the
close
of
the
second
day
victory
crowned
her
forehead
a
new
era
a
nobler
conception
of
duty
and
existence
had
dawned
upon
that
benighted
and
heathen
residence
the
wealth
of
syria
and
persia
was
poured
out
upon
the
melancholy
wilton
carpets
embroidered
comets
and
woven
gold
from
japan
and
teheran
depended
from
and
covered
over
every
sad
a
strange
medley
of
sketches
paintings
fans
embroideries
and
porcelain
was
hung
nailed
pinned
or
stuck
against
the
wall
finally
the
domestic
altarpiece
the
mystical
corot
landscape
was
hoisted
to
its
place
over
the
parlour
fire
and
then
all
was
over
the
setting
sun
streamed
softly
in
at
the
windows
and
peace
reigned
in
that
redeemed
house
and
in
the
heart
of
its
mistress
i
think
it
will
do
now
sybil
said
she
surveying
the
scene
it
must
replied
sybil
you
have
a
plate
or
a
fan
or
coloured
scarf
left
you
must
send
out
and
buy
some
of
these
old
bandannas
if
you
are
going
to
cover
anything
else
what
is
the
use
do
you
suppose
any
human
being
in
washington
will
like
it
they
will
think
you
there
is
such
a
thing
as
replied
her
sister
calmly
sybil
miss
sybil
ross
was
madeleine
lee
sister
the
keenest
psychologist
could
not
have
detected
a
single
feature
quality
which
they
had
in
common
and
for
that
reason
they
were
devoted
friends
madeleine
was

sybil
madeleine
was
indescribable
sybil

transparent
madeleine
was
of
medium
height
with
a
graceful
figure
a
head

enough
hair
to
frame
a
face
full
of
varying
expression
her
eyes
were
never
for
two
consecutive
hours
of
the
same
shade
but
were
more
often
blue
than
grey
people
who
envied
her
smile
said
that
she
cultivated
a
sense
of
humour
in
order
to
show
her
teeth
perhaps
they
were
right
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
her
habit
of
talking
with
gesticulation
would
never
have
grown
upon
her
unless
she
had
known
that
her
hands
were
not
only
beautiful
but
expressive
she
dressed
as
skilfully
as
new
york
women
do
but
in
growing
older
she
began
to
show
symptoms
of
dangerous
unconventionality
she
had
been
heard
to
express
a
low
opinion
of
her
countrywomen
who
blindly
fell
down
before
the
golden
calf
of
worth
and
she
had
even
fought
a
battle
of
great
severity
while
it
lasted
with
one
of
her
friends
who
had
been
invited
and
had
gone
to
worth
afternoon
the
secret
was
that
lee
had
artistic
tendencies
and
unless
they
were
checked
in
time
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
be
the
consequence
but
as
yet
they
had
done
no
harm
indeed
they
rather
helped
to
give
her
that
sort
of
atmosphere
which
belongs
only
to
certain
women
as
indescribable
as
the
afterglow
as
impalpable
as
an
indian
summer
mist
and
except
to
people
who
feel
rather
than
reason
sybil
had
none
of
it
the
imagination
gave
up
all
attempts
to
soar
where
she
came
a
more
straightforward
downright
gay
sympathetic
shallow
sternly
practical
young
woman
has
rarely
touched
this
planet
her
mind
had
room
for
neither
nor
she
could
not
have
lived
in
the
past
or
the
future
if
she
had
spent
her
days
in
churches
and
her
nights
in
tombs
she
was
not
clever
like
madeleine
thank
madeleine
was
not
an
orthodox
member
of
the
church
sermons
bored
her
and
clergymen
never
failed
to
irritate
every
nerve
in
her
excitable
system
sybil
was
a
simple
and
devout
worshipper
at
the
ritualistic
altar
she
bent
humbly
before
the
paulist
fathers
when
she
went
to
a
ball
she
always
had
the
best
partner
in
the
room
and
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
but
then
she
always
prayed
for
one
somehow
it
strengthened
her
faith
her
sister
took
care
never
to
laugh
at
her
on
this
score
or
to
shock
her
religious
opinions
time
enough
said
she
for
her
to
forget
religion
when
religion
fails
as
for
regular
attendance
at
church
madeleine
was
able
to
reconcile
their
habits
without
trouble
she
herself
had
not
entered
a
church
for
years
she
said
it
gave
her
unchristian
feelings
but
sybil
had
a
voice
of
excellent
quality
well
trained
and
cultivated
madeleine
insisted
that
she
should
sing
in
the
choir
and
by
this
little
manoeuvre
the
divergence
of
their
paths
was
made
less
evident
madeleine
did
not
sing
and
therefore
could
not
go
to
church
with
sybil
this
outrageous
fallacy
seemed
perfectly
to
answer
its
purpose
and
sybil
accepted
it
in
good
faith
as
a
fair
working
principle
which
explained
itself
madeleine
was
sober
in
her
tastes
she
wasted
no
money
she
made
no
display
she
walked
rather
than
drove
and
wore
neither
diamonds
nor
brocades
but
the
general
impression
she
made
was
nevertheless
one
of
luxury
on
the
other
hand
her
sister
had
her
dresses
from
paris
and
wore
them
and
her
ornaments
according
to
all
the
formulas
she
was
correct
and
bent
her
round
white
shoulders
to
whatever
burden
the
parisian
autocrat
chose
to
put
upon
them
madeleine
never
interfered
and
always
paid
the
bills
before
they
had
been
ten
days
in
washington
they
fell
gently
into
their
place
and
were
carried
along
without
an
effort
on
the
stream
of
social
life
society
was
kind
there
was
no
reason
for
its
being
otherwise
lee
and
her
sister
had
no
enemies
held
no
offices
and
did
their
best
to
make
themselves
popular
sybil
had
not
passed
summers
at
newport
and
winters
in
new
york
in
vain
and
neither
her
face
nor
her
figure
her
voice
nor
her
dancing
needed
apology
politics
were
not
her
strong
point
she
was
induced
to
go
once
to
the
capitol
and
to
sit
ten
minutes
in
the
gallery
of
the
senate
no
one
ever
knew
what
her
impressions
were
with
feminine
tact
she
managed
not
to
betray
herself
but
in
truth
her
notion
of
legislative
bodies
was
vague
floating
between
her
experience
at
church
and
at
the
opera
so
that
the
idea
of
a
performance
of
some
kind
was
never
out
of
her
head
to
her
mind
the
senate
was
a
place
where
people
went
to
recite
speeches
and
she
naively
assumed
that
the
speeches
were
useful
and
had
a
purpose
but
as
they
did
not
interest
her
she
never
went
again
this
is
a
very
common
conception
of
congress
many
congressmen
share
it
her
sister
was
more
patient
and
bolder
she
went
to
the
capitol
nearly
every
day
for
at
least
two
weeks
at
the
end
of
that
time
her
interest
began
to
flag
and
she
thought
it
better
to
read
the
debates
every
morning
in
the
congressional
record
finding
this
a
laborious
and
not
always
an
instructive
task
she
began
to
skip
the
dull
parts
and
in
the
absence
of
any
exciting
question
she
at
last
resigned
herself
to
skipping
the
whole
nevertheless
she
still
had
energy
to
visit
the
senate
gallery
occasionally
when
she
was
told
that
a
splendid
orator
was
about
to
speak
on
a
question
of
deep
interest
to
his
country
she
listened
with
a
little
disposition
to
admire
if
she
could
and
whenever
she
could
she
did
admire
she
said
nothing
but
she
listened
sharply
she
wanted
to
learn
how
the
machinery
of
government
worked
and
what
was
the
quality
of
the
men
who
controlled
it
one
by
one
she
passed
them
through
her
crucibles
and
tested
them
by
acids
and
by
fire
a
few
survived
her
tests
and
came
out
alive
though
more
or
less
disfigured
where
she
had
found
impurities
of
the
whole
number
only
one
retained
under
this
process
enough
character
to
interest
her
in
these
early
visits
to
congress
lee
sometimes
had
the
company
of
john
carrington
a
washington
lawyer
about
forty
years
old
who
by
virtue
of
being
a
virginian
and
a
distant
connection
of
her
husband
called
himself
a
cousin
and
took
a
tone
of
which
lee
accepted
because
carrington
was
a
man
whom
she
liked
and
because
he
was
one
whom
life
had
treated
hardly
he
was
of
that
unfortunate
generation
in
the
south
which
began
existence
with
civil
war
and
he
was
perhaps
the
more
unfortunate
because
like
most
educated
virginians
of
the
old
washington
school
he
had
seen
from
the
first
that
whatever
issue
the
war
took
virginia
and
he
must
be
ruined
at
he
had
gone
into
the
rebel
army
as
a
private
and
carried
his
musket
modestly
through
a
campaign
or
two
after
which
he
slowly
rose
to
the
rank
of
senior
captain
in
his
regiment
and
closed
his
services
on
the
staff
of
a
always
doing
scrupulously
enough
what
he
conceived
to
be
his
duty
and
never
doing
it
with
enthusiasm
when
the
rebel
armies
surrendered
he
rode
away
to
his
family
plantation
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
for
it
was
only
a
few
miles
from
appomatox
and
at
once
began
to
study
law
then
leaving
his
mother
and
sisters
to
do
what
they
could
with
the
plantation
he
began
the
practice
of
law
in
washington
hoping
thus
to
support
himself
and
them
he
had
succeeded
after
a
fashion
and
for
the
first
time
the
future
seemed
not
absolutely
dark
lee
house
was
an
oasis
to
him
and
he
found
himself
to
his
surprise
almost
gay
in
her
company
the
gaiety
was
of
a
very
quiet
kind
and
sybil
while
friendly
with
him
averred
that
he
was
certainly
dull
but
this
dulness
had
a
fascination
for
madeleine
who
having
tasted
many
more
kinds
of
the
wine
of
life
than
sybil
had
learned
to
value
certain
delicacies
of
age
and
flavour
that
were
lost
upon
younger
and
coarser
palates
he
talked
rather
slowly
and
almost
with
effort
but
he
had
something
of
the
dignity
others
call
it
stiffness
of
the
old
virginia
school
and
twenty
years
of
constant
responsibility
and
deferred
hope
had
added
a
touch
of
care
that
bordered
closely
on
sadness
his
great
attraction
was
that
he
never
talked
or
seemed
to
think
of
himself
lee
trusted
in
him
by
instinct
he
is
a
type
said
she
he
is
my
idea
of
george
washington
at
one
morning
in
december
carrington
entered
lee
parlour
towards
noon
and
asked
if
she
cared
to
visit
the
capitol
you
will
have
a
chance
of
hearing
what
may
be
the
last
great
speech
of
our
greatest
statesman
said
he
you
should
a
splendid
sample
of
our
native
raw
material
sir
asked
she
fresh
from
a
reading
of
dickens
and
his
famous
picture
of
american
statesmanship
precisely
so
said
carrington
the
prairie
giant
of
peonia
the
favourite
son
of
illinois
the
man
who
came
within
three
votes
of
getting
the
party
nomination
for
the
presidency
last
spring
and
was
only
defeated
because
ten
small
intriguers
are
sharper
than
one
big
one
the
honourable
silas
ratcliffe
senator
from
illinois
he
will
be
run
for
the
presidency
what
does
the
stand
for
asked
sybil
i
do
remember
ever
to
have
heard
his
middle
name
said
carrington
perhaps
it
is
peonia
or
prairie
i
ca
he
is
the
man
whose
appearance
struck
me
so
much
when
we
were
in
the
senate
last
week
is
he
not
a
great
ponderous
man
over
six
feet
high
very
senatorial
and
dignified
with
a
large
head
and
rather
good
features
inquired
lee
the
same
replied
carrington
by
all
means
hear
him
speak
he
is
the
of
the
new
president
who
is
to
be
allowed
no
peace
unless
he
makes
terms
with
ratcliffe
and
so
every
one
thinks
that
the
prairie
giant
of
peonia
will
have
the
choice
of
the
state
or
treasury
department
if
he
takes
either
it
will
be
the
treasury
for
he
is
a
desperate
political
manager
and
will
want
the
patronage
for
the
next
national
lee
was
delighted
to
hear
the
debate
and
carrington
was
delighted
to
sit
through
it
by
her
side
and
to
exchange
running
comments
with
her
on
the
speeches
and
the
speakers
have
you
ever
met
the
senator
asked
she
i
have
acted
several
times
as
counsel
before
his
committees
he
is
an
excellent
chairman
always
attentive
and
generally
where
was
he
born
the
family
is
a
new
england
one
and
i
believe
respectable
he
came
i
think
from
some
place
in
the
connecticut
valley
but
whether
vermont
new
hampshire
or
massachusetts
i
do
is
he
an
educated
man
he
got
a
kind
of
classical
education
at
one
of
the
country
colleges
there
i
suspect
he
has
as
much
education
as
is
good
for
him
but
he
went
west
very
soon
after
leaving
college
and
being
then
young
and
fresh
from
that
of
abolition
he
threw
himself
into
the
movement
in
illinois
and
after
a
long
struggle
he
rose
with
the
wave
he
would
not
do
the
same
thing
why
not
he
is
older
more
experienced
and
not
so
wise
besides
he
has
no
longer
the
time
to
wait
can
you
see
his
eyes
from
here
i
call
them
yankee
do
abuse
the
yankees
said
lee
i
am
half
yankee
is
that
abuse
do
you
mean
to
deny
that
they
have
eyes
i
concede
that
there
may
be
eyes
among
them
but
virginians
are
not
fair
judges
of
their
cold
eyes
he
continued
steel
grey
rather
small
not
unpleasant
in
diabolic
in
a
passion
but
worst
when
a
little
suspicious
then
they
watch
you
as
though
you
were
a
young
to
be
killed
when
does
he
not
look
you
in
the
face
yes
but
not
as
though
he
liked
you
his
eyes
only
seem
to
ask
the
possible
uses
you
might
be
put
to
ah
the
has
given
him
the
floor
now
we
shall
have
it
hard
voice
is
it
not
like
his
eyes
hard
manner
like
his
voice
hard
all
what
a
pity
he
is
so
dreadfully
senatorial
said
lee
otherwise
i
rather
admire
now
he
is
settling
down
to
his
work
continued
carrington
see
how
he
dodges
all
the
sharp
issues
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
yankee
what
a
genius
the
fellow
has
for
leading
a
party
do
you
see
how
well
it
is
all
done
the
new
president
flattered
and
conciliated
the
party
united
and
given
a
strong
lead
and
now
we
shall
see
how
the
president
will
deal
with
him
ten
to
one
on
ratcliffe
come
there
is
that
stupid
ass
from
missouri
getting
up
let
us
as
they
passed
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
avenue
lee
turned
to
carrington
as
though
she
had
been
reflecting
deeply
and
had
at
length
reached
a
decision
mr
carrington
said
she
i
want
to
know
senator
you
will
meet
him
evening
replied
carrington
at
your
senatorial
the
senator
from
new
york
the
honourable
schuyler
clinton
was
an
old
admirer
of
lee
and
his
wife
was
a
cousin
of
hers
more
or
less
distant
they
had
lost
no
time
in
honouring
the
letter
of
credit
she
thus
had
upon
them
and
invited
her
and
her
sister
to
a
solemn
dinner
as
imposing
as
political
dignity
could
make
it
carrington
as
a
connection
of
hers
was
one
of
the
party
and
almost
the
only
one
among
the
twenty
persons
at
table
who
had
neither
an
office
nor
a
title
nor
a
constituency
senator
clinton
received
lee
and
her
sister
with
tender
enthusiasm
for
they
were
attractive
specimens
of
his
constituents
he
pressed
their
hands
and
evidently
restrained
himself
only
by
an
effort
from
embracing
them
for
the
senator
had
a
marked
regard
for
pretty
women
and
had
made
love
to
every
girl
with
any
pretensions
to
beauty
that
had
appeared
in
the
state
of
new
york
for
fully
half
a
century
at
the
same
time
he
whispered
an
apology
in
her
ear
he
regretted
so
much
that
he
was
obliged
to
forego
the
pleasure
of
taking
her
to
dinner
washington
was
the
only
city
in
america
where
this
could
have
happened
but
it
was
a
fact
that
ladies
here
were
very
great
stickiers
for
etiquette
on
the
other
hand
he
had
the
sad
consolation
that
she
would
be
the
gainer
for
he
had
allotted
to
her
lord
skye
the
british
minister
a
most
agreeable
man
and
not
married
as
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
and
on
the
other
side
i
have
ventured
to
place
senator
ratcliffe
of
illinois
whose
admirable
speech
i
saw
you
listening
to
with
such
rapt
attention
yesterday
i
thought
you
might
like
to
know
him
did
i
do
right
madeleine
assured
him
that
he
had
divined
her
inmost
wishes
and
he
turned
with
even
more
warmth
of
affection
to
her
sister
as
for
you
my
dear
dear
sybil
what
can
i
do
to
make
your
dinner
agreeable
if
i
give
your
sister
a
coronet
i
am
only
sorry
not
to
have
a
diadem
for
you
but
i
have
done
everything
in
my
power
the
first
secretary
of
the
russian
legation
count
popoff
will
take
you
in
a
charming
young
man
my
dear
sybil
and
on
your
other
side
i
have
placed
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
whom
you
and
so
after
the
due
delay
the
party
settled
themselves
at
the
and
lee
found
senator
ratcliffe
grey
eyes
resting
on
her
face
for
a
moment
as
they
sat
down
lord
skye
was
very
agreeable
and
at
almost
any
other
moment
of
her
life
lee
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
talk
with
him
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
her
dinner
tall
slender
awkward
and
stammering
with
his
elaborate
british
stammer
whenever
it
suited
his
convenience
to
do
so
a
sharp
observer
who
had
wit
which
he
commonly
concealed
a
humourist
who
was
satisfied
to
laugh
silently
at
his
own
humour
a
diplomatist
who
used
the
mask
of
frankness
with
great
effect
lord
skye
was
one
of
the
most
popular
men
in
washington
every
one
knew
that
he
was
a
ruthless
critic
of
american
manners
but
he
had
the
art
to
combine
ridicule
with
and
he
was
all
the
more
popular
accordingly
he
was
an
outspoken
admirer
of
american
women
in
everything
except
their
voices
and
he
did
not
even
shrink
from
occasionally
quizzing
a
little
the
national
peculiarities
of
his
own
countrywomen
a
sure
piece
of
flattery
to
their
american
cousins
he
would
gladly
have
devoted
himself
to
lee
but
decent
civility
required
that
he
should
pay
some
attention
to
his
hostess
and
he
was
too
good
a
diplomatist
not
to
be
attentive
to
a
hostess
who
was
the
wife
of
a
senator
and
that
senator
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
foreign
relations
the
moment
his
head
was
turned
lee
dashed
at
her
peonia
giant
who
was
then
consuming
his
fish
and
wishing
he
understood
why
the
british
minister
had
worn
no
gloves
while
he
himself
had
sacrificed
his
convictions
by
wearing
the
largest
and
whitest
pair
of
french
kids
that
could
be
bought
for
money
on
pennsylvania
avenue
there
was
a
little
touch
of
mortification
in
the
idea
that
he
was
not
quite
at
home
among
fashionable
people
and
at
this
instant
he
felt
that
true
happiness
was
only
to
be
found
among
the
simple
and
honest
sons
and
daughters
of
toil
a
certain
secret
jealousy
of
the
british
minister
is
always
lurking
in
the
breast
of
every
american
senator
if
he
is
truly
democratic
for
democracy
rightly
understood
is
the
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
benefit
of
senators
and
there
is
always
a
danger
that
the
british
minister
may
not
understand
this
political
principle
as
he
should
lord
skye
had
run
the
risk
of
making
two
blunders
of
offending
the
senator
from
new
york
by
neglecting
his
wife
and
the
senator
from
illinois
by
engrossing
the
attention
of
lee
a
young
englishman
would
have
done
both
but
lord
skye
had
studied
the
american
constitution
the
wife
of
the
senator
from
new
york
now
thought
him
most
agreeable
and
at
the
same
moment
the
senator
from
illinois
awoke
to
the
conviction
that
after
all
even
in
frivolous
and
fashionable
circles
true
dignity
is
in
no
danger
of
neglect
an
american
senator
represents
a
sovereign
state
the
great
state
of
illinois
is
as
big
as
england
with
the
convenient
omission
of
wales
scotland
ireland
canada
india
australia
and
a
few
other
continents
and
islands
and
in
short
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
lord
skye
was
not
formidable
to
him
even
in
light
society
had
not
lee
herself
as
good
as
said
that
no
position
equalled
that
of
an
american
senator
in
ten
minutes
lee
had
this
devoted
statesman
at
her
feet
she
had
not
studied
the
senate
without
a
purpose
she
had
read
with
unerring
instinct
one
general
characteristic
of
all
senators
a
boundless
and
guileless
thirst
for
flattery
engendered
by
daily
draughts
from
political
friends
or
dependents
then
becoming
a
necessity
like
a
dram
and
swallowed
with
a
heavy
smile
of
ineffable
content
a
single
glance
at
ratcliffe
face
showed
madeleine
that
she
need
not
be
afraid
of
flattering
too
grossly
her
own
not
his
was
the
only
restraint
upon
her
use
of
this
feminine
bait
she
opened
upon
him
with
an
apparent
simplicity
and
gravity
a
quiet
repose
of
manner
and
an
evident
consciousness
of
her
own
strength
which
meant
that
she
was
most
dangerous
i
heard
your
speech
yesterday
ratcliffe
i
am
glad
to
have
a
chance
of
telling
you
how
much
i
was
impressed
by
it
it
seemed
to
me
masterly
do
you
not
find
that
it
has
had
a
great
effect
i
thank
you
madam
i
hope
it
will
help
to
unite
the
party
but
as
yet
we
have
had
no
time
to
measure
its
results
that
will
require
several
days
the
senator
spoke
in
his
senatorial
manner
elaborate
condescending
and
a
little
on
his
guard
do
you
know
said
lee
turning
towards
him
as
though
he
were
a
valued
friend
and
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
do
you
know
that
every
one
told
me
i
should
be
shocked
by
the
falling
off
in
political
ability
at
washington
i
did
not
believe
them
and
since
hearing
your
speech
i
am
sure
they
are
mistaken
do
you
yourself
think
there
is
less
ability
in
congress
than
there
used
to
be
well
madam
it
is
difficult
to
answer
that
question
government
is
not
so
easy
now
as
it
was
formerly
there
are
different
customs
there
are
many
men
of
fair
abilities
in
public
life
many
more
than
there
used
to
be
and
there
is
sharper
criticism
and
more
of
was
i
right
in
thinking
that
you
have
a
strong
resemblance
to
daniel
webster
in
your
way
of
speaking
you
come
from
the
same
neighbourhood
do
you
not
lee
here
hit
on
ratcliffe
weak
point
the
outline
of
his
head
had
in
fact
a
certain
resemblance
to
that
of
webster
and
he
prided
himself
upon
it
and
on
a
distant
relationship
to
the
expounder
of
the
constitution
he
began
to
think
that
lee
was
a
very
intelligent
person
his
modest
admission
of
the
resemblance
gave
her
the
opportunity
to
talk
of
webster
oratory
and
the
conversation
soon
spread
to
a
discussion
of
the
merits
of
clay
and
calhoun
the
senator
found
that
his
neighbour
a
fashionable
new
york
woman
exquisitely
dressed
and
with
a
voice
and
manner
seductively
soft
and
gentle
had
read
the
speeches
of
webster
and
calhoun
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
him
that
she
had
persuaded
the
honest
carrington
to
bring
her
the
volumes
and
to
mark
such
passages
as
were
worth
her
reading
but
she
took
care
to
lead
the
conversation
and
she
criticised
with
some
skill
and
more
humour
the
weak
points
in
websterian
oratory
saying
with
a
little
laugh
and
a
glance
into
his
delighted
eyes
my
judgment
may
not
be
worth
much
mr
senator
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
our
fathers
thought
too
much
of
themselves
and
till
you
teach
me
better
i
shall
continue
to
think
that
the
passage
in
your
speech
of
yesterday
which
began
with
strength
lies
in
this
twisted
and
tangled
mass
of
isolated
principles
the
hair
of
the
giant
of
party
is
both
for
language
and
imagery
quite
equal
to
anything
of
the
senator
from
illinois
rose
to
this
gaudy
fly
like
a
huge
salmon
his
white
waistcoat
gave
out
a
mild
silver
reflection
as
he
slowly
came
to
the
surface
and
gorged
the
hook
he
made
not
even
a
plunge
not
one
perceptible
effort
to
tear
out
the
barbed
weapon
but
floating
gently
to
her
feet
allowed
himself
to
be
landed
as
though
it
were
a
pleasure
only
miserable
casuists
will
ask
whether
this
was
fair
play
on
madeleine
part
whether
flattery
so
gross
cost
her
conscience
no
twinge
and
whether
any
woman
can
without
be
guilty
of
such
shameless
falsehood
she
however
scorned
the
idea
of
falsehood
she
would
have
defended
herself
by
saying
that
she
had
not
so
much
praised
ratcliffe
as
depreciated
webster
and
that
she
was
honest
in
her
opinion
of
the
american
oratory
but
she
could
not
deny
that
she
had
wilfully
allowed
the
senator
to
draw
conclusions
very
different
from
any
she
actually
held
she
could
not
deny
that
she
had
intended
to
flatter
him
to
the
extent
necessary
for
her
purpose
and
that
she
was
pleased
at
her
success
before
they
rose
from
table
the
senator
had
quite
unbent
himself
he
was
talking
naturally
shrewdly
and
with
some
humour
he
had
told
her
illinois
stories
spoken
with
extraordinary
freedom
about
his
political
situation
and
expressed
the
wish
to
call
upon
lee
if
he
could
ever
hope
to
find
her
at
home
i
am
always
at
home
on
sunday
evenings
said
she
to
her
eyes
he
was
the
of
american
politics
he
was
charged
with
the
meaning
of
the
mysteries
the
clue
to
political
hieroglyphics
through
him
she
hoped
to
sound
the
depths
of
statesmanship
and
to
bring
up
from
its
oozy
bed
that
pearl
of
which
she
was
in
search
the
mysterious
gem
which
must
lie
hidden
somewhere
in
politics
she
wanted
to
understand
this
man
to
turn
him
inside
out
to
experiment
on
him
and
use
him
as
young
physiologists
use
frogs
and
kittens
if
there
was
good
or
bad
in
him
she
meant
to
find
its
meaning
and
he
was
a
western
widower
of
fifty
his
quarters
in
washington
were
in
gaunt
rooms
furnished
only
with
public
documents
and
enlivened
by
western
politicians
and
in
the
summer
he
retired
to
a
solitary
white
framehouse
with
green
blinds
surrounded
by
a
few
feet
of
grass
and
a
white
fence
its
interior
more
dreary
still
with
iron
stoves
carpets
cold
white
walls
and
one
large
engraving
of
abraham
lincoln
in
the
parlour
all
in
peonia
illinois
what
equality
was
there
between
these
two
combatants
what
hope
for
him
what
risk
for
her
and
yet
madeleine
lee
had
fully
her
match
in
silas
ratcliffe
chapter
iii
lee
soon
became
popular
her
parlour
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
certain
men
and
women
who
had
the
art
of
finding
its
mistress
at
home
an
art
which
seemed
not
to
be
within
the
powers
of
everybody
carrington
was
apt
to
be
there
more
often
than
any
one
else
so
that
he
was
looked
on
as
almost
a
part
of
the
family
and
if
madeleine
wanted
a
book
from
the
library
or
an
extra
man
at
her
carrington
was
pretty
certain
to
help
her
to
the
one
or
the
other
old
baron
jacobi
the
bulgarian
minister
fell
madly
in
love
with
both
sisters
as
he
commonly
did
with
every
pretty
face
and
neat
figure
he
was
a
witty
cynical
parisian
roué
kept
in
washington
for
years
past
by
his
debts
and
his
salary
always
grumbling
because
there
was
no
opera
and
mysteriously
disappearing
on
visits
to
new
york
a
voracious
devourer
of
french
and
german
literature
especially
of
novels
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
met
every
noted
or
notorious
personage
of
the
century
and
whose
mind
was
a
magazine
of
amusing
information
an
excellent
musical
critic
who
was
not
afraid
to
criticise
sybil
singing
a
connoisseur
in
who
laughed
at
madeleine
display
of
odds
and
ends
and
occasionally
brought
her
a
persian
plate
or
a
bit
of
embroidery
which
he
said
was
good
and
would
do
her
credit
this
old
sinner
believed
in
everything
that
was
perverse
and
wicked
but
he
accepted
the
prejudices
of
society
and
was
too
clever
to
obtrude
his
opinions
upon
others
he
would
have
married
both
sisters
at
once
more
willingly
than
either
alone
but
as
he
feelingly
said
if
i
were
forty
years
younger
mademoiselle
you
should
not
sing
to
me
so
his
friend
popoff
an
intelligent
vivacious
russian
with
very
calmuck
features
susceptible
as
a
girl
and
passionately
fond
of
music
hung
over
piano
by
the
hour
he
brought
russian
airs
which
he
taught
her
to
sing
and
if
the
truth
were
known
he
bored
madeleine
desperately
for
she
undertook
to
act
the
part
of
duenna
to
her
younger
sister
a
very
different
visitor
was
french
a
young
member
of
congress
from
connecticut
who
aspired
to
act
the
part
of
the
educated
gentleman
in
politics
and
to
purify
the
public
tone
he
had
reform
principles
and
an
unfortunately
conceited
maimer
he
was
rather
wealthy
rather
clever
rather
rather
honest
and
rather
vulgar
his
allegiance
was
divided
between
lee
and
her
sister
whom
he
infuriated
by
addressing
as
miss
sybil
with
patronising
familiarity
he
was
particularly
strong
in
what
he
called
badinaige
and
his
playful
but
ungainly
attempts
at
wit
drove
lee
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
when
in
a
solemn
mood
he
talked
as
though
he
were
practising
for
the
ear
of
a
college
debating
society
and
with
a
still
worse
effect
on
the
patience
but
with
all
this
he
was
useful
always
bubbling
with
the
latest
political
gossip
and
deeply
interested
in
the
fate
of
party
stakes
quite
another
sort
of
person
was
hartbeest
schneidekoupon
a
citizen
of
philadelphia
though
commonly
resident
in
new
york
where
he
had
fallen
a
victim
to
sybil
charms
and
made
efforts
to
win
her
young
affections
by
instructing
her
in
the
mysteries
of
currency
and
protection
to
both
which
subjects
he
was
devoted
to
forward
these
two
interests
and
to
watch
over
miss
welfare
he
made
periodical
visits
to
washington
where
he
closeted
himself
with
and
gave
expensive
dinners
to
members
of
congress
schneidekoupon
was
rich
and
about
thirty
years
old
tall
and
thin
with
bright
eyes
and
smooth
face
elaborate
manners
and
much
loquacity
he
had
the
reputation
of
turning
rapid
intellectual
somersaults
partly
to
amuse
himself
and
partly
to
startle
society
at
one
moment
he
was
artistic
and
discoursed
scientifically
about
his
own
paintings
at
another
he
was
literary
and
wrote
a
book
on
noble
living
with
a
humanitarian
purpose
at
another
he
was
devoted
to
sport
rode
a
steeplechase
played
polo
and
set
up
a
his
last
occupation
was
to
establish
in
philadelphia
the
protective
review
a
periodical
in
the
interests
of
american
industry
which
he
edited
himself
as
a
to
congress
the
cabinet
and
the
presidency
at
about
the
same
time
he
bought
a
yacht
and
heavy
bets
were
pending
among
his
sporting
friends
whether
he
would
manage
to
sink
first
his
review
or
his
yacht
but
he
was
an
amiable
and
excellent
fellow
through
all
his
eccentricities
and
he
brought
to
lee
the
simple
outpourings
of
the
amateur
politician
a
much
higher
type
of
character
was
nathan
gore
of
massachusetts
a
handsome
man
with
a
grey
beard
a
straight
sharply
cut
nose
and
a
fine
penetrating
eye
in
his
youth
a
successful
poet
whose
satires
made
a
noise
in
their
day
and
are
still
remembered
for
the
pungency
and
wit
of
a
few
verses
then
a
deep
student
in
europe
for
many
years
until
his
famous
history
of
spain
in
america
placed
him
instantly
at
the
head
of
american
historians
and
made
him
minister
at
madrid
where
he
remained
four
years
to
his
entire
satisfaction
this
being
the
nearest
approach
to
a
patent
of
nobility
and
a
government
pension
which
the
american
citizen
can
attain
a
change
of
administration
had
reduced
him
to
private
life
again
and
after
some
years
of
retirement
he
was
now
in
washington
willing
to
be
restored
to
his
old
mission
every
president
thinks
it
respectable
to
have
at
least
one
literary
man
in
his
pay
and
gore
prospects
were
fair
for
obtaining
his
object
as
he
had
the
active
support
of
a
majority
of
the
massachusetts
delegation
he
was
abominably
selfish
colossally
egoistic
and
not
a
little
vain
but
he
was
shrewd
he
knew
how
to
hold
his
tongue
he
could
flatter
dexterously
and
he
had
learned
to
eschew
satire
only
in
confidence
and
among
friends
he
would
still
talk
freely
but
lee
was
not
yet
on
those
terms
with
him
these
were
all
men
and
there
was
no
want
of
women
in
lee
parlour
but
after
all
they
are
able
to
describe
themselves
better
than
any
poor
novelist
can
describe
them
generally
two
currents
of
conversation
ran
on
together
one
round
sybil
the
other
about
madeleine
mees
ross
said
count
popoff
leading
in
a
handsome
young
foreigner
i
have
your
permission
to
present
to
you
my
friend
count
orsini
secretary
of
the
italian
legation
are
you
at
home
this
afternoon
count
orsini
sings
we
are
charmed
to
see
count
orsini
it
is
well
you
came
so
late
for
i
have
this
moment
come
in
from
making
cabinet
calls
they
were
so
queer
i
have
been
crying
with
laughter
for
an
hour
do
you
find
these
calls
amusing
asked
popoff
gravely
and
diplomatically
indeed
i
do
i
went
with
julia
schneidekoupon
you
know
madeleine
the
schneidekoupons
are
descended
from
all
the
kings
of
israel
and
are
prouder
than
solomon
in
his
glory
and
when
we
got
into
the
house
of
some
dreadful
woman
from
heaven
knows
where
imagine
my
feelings
at
overhearing
this
conversation
may
be
your
family
name
is
my
name
replies
julia
very
tall
and
straight
you
any
friends
whom
i
should
likely
know
think
not
says
julia
severely
i
do
seem
to
remember
of
ever
having
heerd
the
name
but
i
it
all
right
i
like
to
know
who
calls
i
almost
had
hysterics
when
we
got
into
the
street
but
julia
could
not
see
the
joke
at
count
orsini
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
himself
saw
the
joke
so
he
only
smiled
becomingly
and
showed
his
teeth
for
simple
childlike
vanity
and
nothing
equals
an
italian
secretary
of
legation
at
yet
conscious
that
the
effect
of
his
personal
beauty
would
perhaps
be
diminished
by
permanent
silence
he
ventured
to
murmur
presently
do
you
not
find
it
very
strange
this
society
in
america
society
laughed
sybil
with
gay
contempt
there
are
no
snakes
in
america
any
more
than
in
snakes
mademoiselle
repeated
orsini
with
the
doubtful
expression
of
one
who
is
not
quite
certain
whether
he
shall
risk
walking
on
thin
ice
and
decides
to
go
softly
snakes
indeed
they
would
rather
be
doves
i
would
call
a
kind
laugh
from
sybil
strengthened
into
conviction
his
hope
that
he
had
made
a
joke
in
this
unknown
tongue
his
face
brightened
his
confidence
returned
once
or
twice
he
softly
repeated
to
himself
not
snakes
they
would
be
doves
but
lee
sensitive
ear
had
caught
sybil
remark
and
detected
in
it
a
certain
tone
of
condescension
which
was
not
to
her
taste
the
impassive
countenances
of
these
bland
young
secretaries
of
legation
seemed
to
acquiesce
far
too
much
as
a
matter
of
course
in
the
idea
that
there
was
no
society
except
in
the
old
world
she
broke
into
the
conversation
with
an
emphasis
that
fluttered
the
society
in
america
indeed
there
is
society
in
america
and
very
good
society
too
but
it
has
a
code
of
its
own
and
seldom
understand
it
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
orsini
and
you
will
never
be
in
danger
of
making
any
mistake
in
america
means
all
the
honest
women
and
all
the
good
brave
unassuming
men
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
each
of
these
has
a
free
pass
in
every
city
and
village
for
this
generation
only
and
it
depends
on
each
to
make
use
of
this
pass
or
not
as
it
may
happen
to
suit
his
or
her
fancy
to
this
rule
there
are
no
exceptions
and
those
who
say
is
our
father
will
surely
furnish
food
for
that
humour
which
is
the
staple
product
of
our
the
alarmed
youths
who
did
not
in
the
least
understand
the
meaning
of
this
demonstration
looked
on
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
acquiescence
while
lee
brandished
her
in
the
act
of
transferring
a
lump
of
sugar
to
her
cup
quite
unconscious
of
the
slight
absurdity
of
the
gesture
while
sybil
stared
in
amazement
for
it
was
not
often
that
her
sister
waved
the
stars
and
stripes
so
energetically
whatever
their
silent
criticisms
might
be
however
lee
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
be
conscious
of
them
or
indeed
to
care
for
anything
but
what
she
was
saying
there
was
a
moment
pause
when
she
came
to
the
end
of
her
speech
and
then
the
thread
of
talk
was
quietly
taken
up
again
where
sybil
incipient
sneer
had
broken
it
carrington
came
in
what
have
you
been
doing
at
the
capitol
asked
madeleine
lobbying
was
the
reply
given
in
the
tone
of
carrington
humour
so
soon
and
congress
only
two
days
old
exclaimed
lee
madam
rejoined
carrington
with
his
quietest
malice
congressmen
are
like
birds
of
the
air
which
are
caught
only
by
the
early
good
afternoon
lee
miss
sybil
how
do
you
do
again
which
of
these
gentlemen
hearts
are
you
feeding
upon
now
this
was
the
refined
style
of
french
indulging
in
what
he
was
pleased
to
term
he
too
was
on
his
way
from
the
capitol
and
had
come
in
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
little
human
society
sybil
made
a
face
which
plainly
expressed
a
longing
to
inflict
on
french
some
grievous
personal
wrong
but
she
pretended
not
to
hear
he
sat
down
by
madeleine
and
asked
did
you
see
ratcliffe
yesterday
yes
said
madeleine
he
was
here
last
evening
with
carrington
and
one
or
two
did
he
say
anything
about
politics
not
a
word
we
talked
mostly
about
books
what
does
he
know
about
books
you
must
ask
well
this
is
the
most
ridiculous
situation
we
are
all
in
no
one
knows
anything
about
the
new
president
you
could
take
your
oath
that
everybody
is
in
the
dark
ratcliffe
says
he
knows
as
little
as
the
rest
of
us
but
it
ca
be
true
he
is
too
old
a
politician
not
to
have
wires
in
his
hand
and
only
one
of
the
pages
of
the
senate
told
my
colleague
cutter
that
a
letter
sent
off
by
him
yesterday
was
directed
to
sam
grimes
of
north
bend
who
as
every
one
knows
belongs
to
the
president
particular
why
schneidekoupon
how
do
you
do
when
did
you
come
on
thank
you
this
morning
replied
schneidekoupon
just
entering
the
room
so
glad
to
see
you
again
lee
how
do
you
and
your
sister
like
washington
do
you
know
i
have
brought
julia
on
for
a
visit
i
thought
i
should
find
her
here
she
has
just
gone
she
has
been
all
the
afternoon
with
sybil
making
calls
she
says
you
want
her
here
to
lobby
for
you
schneidekoupon
is
it
true
so
i
did
replied
he
with
a
laugh
but
she
is
precious
little
use
so
i
come
to
draft
you
into
the
me
yes
you
know
we
all
expect
senator
ratcliffe
to
be
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
keep
him
straight
on
the
currency
and
the
tariff
so
i
have
come
on
to
establish
more
intimate
relations
with
him
as
they
say
in
diplomacy
i
want
to
get
him
to
dine
with
me
at
welckley
but
as
i
know
he
keeps
very
shy
of
politics
i
thought
my
only
chance
was
to
make
it
a
ladies
dinner
so
i
brought
on
julia
i
shall
try
and
get
schuyler
clinton
and
i
depend
upon
you
and
your
sister
to
help
julia
me
at
a
lobby
dinner
is
that
proper
why
not
you
shall
choose
the
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
but
it
would
certainly
be
amusing
sybil
must
not
go
but
i
excuse
me
julia
depends
upon
miss
ross
and
will
not
go
to
table
without
well
assented
lee
hesitatingly
perhaps
if
you
get
clinton
and
if
your
sister
is
there
and
who
else
choose
your
own
i
know
no
oh
yes
here
is
french
not
quite
sound
on
the
tariff
but
good
for
what
we
want
just
now
then
we
can
get
gore
he
has
his
little
hatchet
to
grind
too
and
will
be
glad
to
help
grind
ours
we
only
want
two
or
three
more
and
i
will
have
an
extra
man
or
so
to
fill
do
ask
the
speaker
i
want
to
know
i
will
and
carrington
and
my
pennsylvania
senator
that
will
do
nobly
remember
welckley
saturday
at
meanwhile
sybil
had
been
at
the
piano
and
when
she
had
sung
for
a
time
orsini
was
induced
to
take
her
place
and
show
that
it
was
possible
to
sing
without
injury
to
one
beauty
baron
jacobi
came
in
and
found
fault
with
them
both
little
miss
dare
commonly
known
among
her
male
friends
as
little
daredevil
who
was
always
absorbed
in
some
flirtation
with
a
secretary
of
legation
came
in
quite
unaware
that
popoff
was
present
and
retired
with
him
into
a
corner
while
orsini
and
jacobi
bullied
poor
sybil
and
fought
with
each
other
at
the
piano
everybody
was
talking
with
very
little
reference
to
any
reply
when
at
last
lee
drove
them
all
out
of
the
room
we
are
quiet
people
said
she
and
we
dine
at
senator
ratcliffe
had
not
failed
to
make
his
sunday
evening
call
upon
lee
perhaps
it
was
not
strictly
correct
to
say
that
they
had
talked
books
all
the
evening
but
whatever
the
conversation
was
it
had
only
confirmed
ratcliffe
admiration
for
lee
who
without
intending
to
do
so
had
acted
a
more
dangerous
part
than
if
she
had
been
the
most
accomplished
of
coquettes
nothing
could
be
more
fascinating
to
the
weary
politician
in
his
solitude
than
the
repose
of
parlour
and
when
sybil
sang
for
him
one
or
two
simple
airs
she
said
they
were
foreign
hymns
the
senator
being
or
being
considered
orthodox
ratcliffe
heart
yearned
toward
the
charming
girl
quite
with
the
sensations
of
a
father
or
even
of
an
elder
brother
his
brother
senators
very
soon
began
to
remark
that
the
prairie
giant
had
acquired
a
trick
of
looking
up
to
the
ladies
gallery
one
day
jonathan
andrews
the
special
correspondent
of
the
new
york
sidereal
system
a
very
friendly
organ
approached
senator
schuyler
clinton
with
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
can
you
tell
me
said
he
what
has
happened
to
silas
ratcliffe
only
a
moment
ago
i
was
talking
with
him
at
his
seat
on
a
very
important
subject
about
which
i
must
send
his
opinions
off
to
new
york
when
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
stopped
short
got
up
without
looking
at
me
and
left
the
senate
chamber
and
now
i
see
him
in
the
gallery
talking
with
a
lady
whose
face
i
do
senator
clinton
slowly
adjusted
his
gold
and
looked
up
at
the
place
indicated
ah
lightfoot
lee
i
think
i
will
say
a
word
to
her
myself
and
turning
his
back
on
the
special
correspondent
he
skipped
away
with
youthful
agility
after
the
senator
from
illinois
devil
muttered
andrews
what
has
got
into
the
old
fools
and
in
a
still
less
audible
murmur
as
he
looked
up
to
lee
then
in
close
conversation
with
ratcliffe
had
i
better
make
an
item
of
that
when
young
schneidekoupon
called
upon
senator
ratcliffe
to
invite
him
to
the
dinner
at
welckley
he
found
that
gentleman
overwhelmed
with
work
as
he
averred
and
very
little
disposed
to
converse
no
he
did
not
now
go
out
to
dinner
in
the
present
condition
of
the
public
business
he
found
it
impossible
to
spare
the
time
for
such
amusements
he
regretted
to
decline
schneidekoupon
civility
but
there
were
imperative
reasons
why
he
should
abstain
for
the
present
from
social
entertainments
he
had
made
but
one
exception
to
his
rule
and
only
at
the
pressing
request
of
his
old
friend
senator
clinton
and
on
a
very
special
occasion
schneidekoupon
was
deeply
vexed
the
more
he
said
because
he
had
meant
to
beg
and
clinton
to
be
of
the
party
as
well
as
a
very
charming
lady
who
rarely
went
into
society
but
who
had
almost
consented
to
come
who
is
that
inquired
the
senator
a
lightfoot
lee
of
new
york
probably
you
do
not
know
her
well
enough
to
admire
her
as
i
do
but
i
think
her
quite
the
most
intelligent
woman
i
ever
the
senator
cold
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
young
man
open
face
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
distrust
then
he
solemnly
said
in
his
deepest
senatorial
tones
my
young
friend
at
my
time
of
life
men
have
other
things
to
occupy
them
than
women
however
intelligent
they
may
be
who
else
is
to
be
of
your
party
schneidekoupon
named
his
list
and
for
saturday
evening
at
seven
did
you
say
saturday
at
i
fear
there
is
little
chance
of
my
attending
but
i
will
not
absolutely
decline
perhaps
when
the
moment
arrives
i
may
find
myself
able
to
be
there
but
do
not
count
upon
me
do
not
count
upon
me
good
day
schneidekoupon
was
rather
a
young
man
who
saw
no
deeper
than
his
neighbours
into
the
secrets
of
the
universe
and
he
went
off
swearing
roundly
at
the
infernal
airs
these
senators
give
he
told
lee
all
the
conversation
as
indeed
he
was
compelled
to
do
under
penalty
of
bringing
her
to
his
party
under
false
pretences
just
my
luck
said
he
here
i
am
forced
to
ask
no
end
of
people
to
meet
a
man
who
at
the
same
time
says
he
shall
probably
not
come
why
under
the
stars
could
he
say
like
other
people
whether
he
was
coming
or
not
i
known
dozens
of
senators
lee
and
they
all
like
that
they
never
think
of
any
one
but
lee
smiled
rather
a
forced
smile
and
soothed
his
wounded
feelings
she
had
no
doubt
the
dinner
would
be
very
agreeable
whether
the
senator
were
there
or
not
at
any
rate
she
would
do
all
she
could
to
carry
it
off
well
and
sybil
should
wear
her
newest
dress
still
she
was
a
little
grave
and
schneidekoupon
could
only
declare
that
she
was
a
trump
that
he
had
told
ratcliffe
she
was
the
cleverest
woman
he
ever
met
and
he
might
have
added
the
most
obliging
and
ratcliffe
had
only
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
green
ape
at
all
which
lee
laughed
and
sent
him
away
as
soon
as
she
could
when
he
was
gone
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
thought
she
saw
the
meaning
of
ratcliffe
sudden
change
in
tone
she
had
no
more
doubt
of
his
coming
to
the
dinner
than
she
had
of
the
reason
why
he
came
and
was
it
possible
that
she
was
being
drawn
into
something
very
near
a
flirtation
with
a
man
twenty
years
her
senior
a
politician
from
illinois
a
huge
ponderous
bald
senator
with
a
websterian
head
who
lived
in
peonia
the
idea
was
almost
too
absurd
to
be
credited
but
on
the
whole
the
thing
itself
was
rather
amusing
i
suppose
senators
can
look
out
for
themselves
like
other
men
was
her
final
conclusion
she
thought
only
of
his
danger
and
she
felt
a
sort
of
compassion
for
him
as
she
reflected
on
the
possible
consequences
of
a
great
absorbing
love
at
his
time
of
life
her
conscience
was
a
little
uneasy
but
of
herself
she
never
thought
yet
it
is
a
historical
fact
that
elderly
senators
have
had
a
curious
fascination
for
young
and
handsome
women
had
they
looked
out
for
themselves
too
and
which
parties
most
needed
to
be
looked
after
when
madeleine
and
her
sister
arrived
at
welckley
the
next
saturday
evening
they
found
poor
schneidekoupon
in
a
temper
very
unbecoming
a
host
he
wo
come
i
told
you
he
would
come
said
he
to
madeleine
as
he
handed
her
into
the
house
if
i
ever
turn
communist
it
will
be
for
the
fun
of
murdering
a
madeleine
consoled
him
gently
but
he
continued
to
use
behind
clinton
back
language
the
most
offensive
and
improper
towards
the
senate
and
at
last
ringing
the
bell
he
sharply
ordered
the
head
waiter
to
serve
dinner
at
that
very
moment
the
door
opened
and
senator
ratcliffe
stately
figure
appeared
on
the
threshold
his
eye
instantly
caught
madeleine
and
she
almost
laughed
aloud
for
she
saw
that
the
senator
was
dressed
with
very
unsenatorial
neatness
that
he
had
actually
a
flower
in
his
and
no
gloves
after
the
enthusiastic
description
which
schneidekoupon
had
given
of
lee
charms
he
could
do
no
less
than
ask
senator
ratcliffe
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
which
he
did
without
delay
either
this
or
the
champagne
or
some
occult
influence
had
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
him
he
appeared
ten
years
younger
than
usual
his
face
was
illuminated
his
eyes
glowed
he
seemed
bent
on
proving
his
kinship
to
the
immortal
webster
by
rivalling
his
convivial
powers
he
dashed
into
the
conversation
laughed
jested
and
ridiculed
told
stories
in
yankee
and
western
dialect
gave
sharp
little
sketches
of
amusing
political
experiences
never
was
more
surprised
in
my
life
whispered
senator
krebs
of
pennsylvania
across
the
table
to
schneidekoupon
had
an
idea
that
ratcliffe
was
so
and
clinton
who
sat
by
madeleine
on
the
other
side
whispered
low
into
her
ear
i
am
afraid
my
dear
lee
that
you
are
responsible
for
this
he
never
talks
so
to
the
nay
he
even
rose
to
a
higher
flight
and
told
the
story
of
president
lincoln
with
a
degree
of
feeling
that
brought
tears
into
their
eyes
the
other
guests
made
no
figure
at
all
the
speaker
consumed
his
solitary
duck
and
his
lonely
champagne
in
a
corner
without
giving
a
sign
even
gore
who
was
not
wont
to
hide
his
light
under
any
kind
of
extinguisher
made
no
attempt
to
claim
the
floor
and
applauded
with
enthusiasm
the
conversation
of
his
opposite
neighbour
people
might
say
that
gore
saw
in
senator
ratcliffe
a
possible
secretary
of
state
be
this
as
it
may
he
certainly
said
to
clinton
in
an
aside
that
was
perfectly
audible
to
every
one
at
the
table
how
brilliant
what
an
original
mind
what
a
sensation
he
would
make
abroad
and
it
was
quite
true
apart
from
the
mere
momentary
effect
of
talk
that
there
was
a
certain
bigness
about
the
man
a
keen
practical
sagacity
a
bold
freedom
of
a
broad
way
of
dealing
with
what
he
knew
carrington
was
the
only
person
at
table
who
looked
on
with
a
perfectly
cool
head
and
who
criticised
in
a
hostile
spirit
impression
of
ratcliffe
was
perhaps
beginning
to
be
warped
by
a
shade
of
jealousy
for
he
was
in
a
peculiarly
bad
temper
this
evening
and
his
irritation
was
not
wholly
concealed
if
one
only
had
any
confidence
in
the
man
he
muttered
to
french
who
sat
by
him
this
unlucky
remark
set
french
to
thinking
how
he
could
draw
ratcliffe
out
and
accordingly
with
his
usual
happy
manner
combining
and
high
principles
he
began
to
attack
the
senator
with
some
badinaige
on
the
delicate
subject
of
civil
service
reform
a
subject
almost
as
dangerous
in
political
conversation
at
washington
as
slavery
itself
in
old
days
before
the
war
french
was
a
reformer
and
lost
no
occasion
of
impressing
his
views
but
unluckily
he
was
a
very
light
weight
and
his
manner
was
a
little
ridiculous
so
that
even
lee
who
was
herself
a
warm
reformer
sometimes
went
over
to
the
other
side
when
he
talked
no
sooner
had
he
now
shot
his
little
arrow
at
the
senator
than
that
astute
man
saw
his
opportunity
and
promised
himself
the
pleasure
of
administering
to
french
punishment
such
as
he
knew
would
delight
the
company
reformer
as
lee
was
and
a
little
alarmed
at
the
roughness
of
treatment
she
could
not
blame
the
prairie
giant
as
she
ought
who
after
knocking
poor
french
down
rolled
him
over
and
over
in
the
mud
are
you
financier
enough
french
to
know
what
are
the
most
famous
products
of
connecticut
french
modestly
suggested
that
he
thought
its
statesmen
best
answered
that
description
no
sir
even
there
you
wrong
the
showmen
beat
you
on
your
own
ground
but
every
child
in
the
union
knows
that
the
most
famous
products
of
connecticut
are
yankee
notions
nutmegs
made
of
wood
and
clocks
that
wo
go
now
your
civil
service
reform
is
just
such
another
yankee
notion
it
a
wooden
nutmeg
it
a
clock
with
a
show
case
and
sham
works
and
you
know
it
you
are
precisely
the
connecticut
peddler
you
have
gone
about
peddling
your
wooden
nutmegs
until
you
have
got
yourself
into
congress
and
now
you
pull
them
out
of
your
pockets
and
not
only
want
us
to
take
them
at
your
own
price
but
you
lecture
us
on
our
sins
if
we
do
well
we
do
mind
your
doing
that
at
home
abuse
us
as
much
as
you
like
to
your
constituents
get
as
many
votes
as
you
can
but
do
electioneer
here
because
we
know
you
intimately
and
we
all
been
a
little
in
the
wooden
nutmeg
business
senator
clinton
and
senator
krebs
chuckled
high
approval
over
this
punishment
of
poor
french
which
was
on
the
level
of
their
idea
of
wit
they
were
all
in
the
nutmeg
business
as
ratcliffe
said
the
victim
tried
to
make
head
against
them
he
protested
that
his
nutmegs
were
genuine
he
sold
no
goods
that
he
did
not
guarantee
and
that
this
particular
article
was
actually
guaranteed
by
the
national
conventions
of
both
political
parties
then
what
you
want
french
is
a
common
school
education
you
need
a
little
study
of
the
alphabet
or
if
you
wo
believe
me
ask
my
brother
senators
here
what
chance
there
is
for
your
reforms
so
long
as
the
american
citizen
is
what
he
you
not
get
much
comfort
in
my
state
french
growled
the
senator
from
pennsylvania
with
a
sneer
suppose
you
come
and
well
well
said
the
benevolent
schuyler
clinton
gleaming
benignantly
through
his
gold
spectacles
do
be
too
hard
on
french
he
means
well
perhaps
he
not
very
wise
but
he
does
good
i
know
more
about
it
than
any
of
you
and
i
do
deny
that
the
thing
is
all
bad
only
as
ratcliffe
says
the
difficulty
is
in
the
people
not
in
us
go
to
work
on
them
french
and
let
us
french
repented
of
his
attack
and
contented
himself
by
muttering
to
carrington
what
a
set
of
damned
old
reprobates
they
are
they
are
right
though
in
one
thing
was
carrington
reply
their
advice
is
good
never
ask
one
of
them
to
reform
anything
if
you
do
you
will
be
reformed
the
dinner
ended
as
brilliantly
as
it
began
and
schneidekoupon
was
delighted
with
his
success
he
had
made
himself
particularly
agreeable
to
sybil
by
confiding
in
her
all
his
hopes
and
fears
about
the
tariff
and
the
finances
when
the
ladies
left
the
table
ratcliffe
could
not
stay
for
a
cigar
he
must
get
back
to
his
rooms
where
he
knew
several
men
were
waiting
for
him
he
would
take
his
leave
of
the
ladies
and
hurry
away
but
when
the
gentlemen
came
up
nearly
an
hour
afterwards
they
found
ratcliffe
still
taking
his
leave
of
the
ladies
who
were
delighted
at
his
entertaining
conversation
and
when
at
last
he
really
departed
he
said
to
lee
as
though
it
were
quite
a
matter
of
course
you
are
at
home
as
usual
evening
madeleine
smiled
bowed
and
he
went
his
way
as
the
two
sisters
drove
home
that
night
madeleine
was
unusually
silent
sybil
yawned
convulsively
and
then
apologized
mr
schneidekoupon
is
very
nice
and
but
a
whole
evening
of
him
goes
a
long
way
and
that
horrid
senator
krebs
would
not
say
a
word
and
drank
a
great
deal
too
much
wine
though
it
could
make
him
any
more
stupid
than
he
is
i
do
think
i
care
for
then
wearily
after
a
pause
well
maude
i
do
hope
you
got
what
you
wanted
i
sure
you
must
have
had
politics
enough
have
you
got
to
the
heart
of
your
great
american
mystery
yet
pretty
near
it
i
think
said
madeleine
half
to
herself
chapter
iv
sunday
evening
was
stormy
and
some
enthusiasm
was
required
to
make
one
face
its
perils
for
the
sake
of
society
nevertheless
a
few
intimates
made
their
appearance
as
usual
at
lee
the
faithful
popoff
was
there
and
miss
dare
also
ran
in
to
pass
an
hour
with
her
dear
sybil
but
as
she
passed
the
whole
evening
in
a
corner
with
popoff
she
must
have
been
disappointed
in
her
object
carrington
came
and
baron
jacobi
schneidekoupon
and
his
sister
dined
with
lee
and
remained
after
dinner
while
sybil
and
julia
schneidekoupon
compared
conclusions
about
washington
society
the
happy
idea
also
occurred
to
gore
that
inasmuch
as
lee
house
was
but
a
step
from
his
hotel
he
might
as
well
take
the
chance
of
amusement
there
as
the
certainty
of
solitude
in
his
rooms
finally
senator
ratcliffe
duly
made
his
appearance
and
having
established
himself
with
a
cup
of
tea
by
madeleine
side
was
soon
left
to
enjoy
a
quiet
talk
with
her
the
rest
of
the
party
by
common
consent
occupying
themselves
with
each
other
under
cover
of
the
murmur
of
conversation
in
the
room
ratcliffe
quickly
became
confidential
i
came
to
suggest
that
if
you
want
to
hear
an
interesting
debate
you
should
come
up
to
the
senate
i
am
told
that
garrard
of
louisiana
means
to
attack
my
last
speech
and
i
shall
probably
in
that
case
have
to
answer
him
with
you
for
a
critic
i
shall
speak
am
i
such
an
amiable
critic
asked
madeleine
i
never
heard
that
amiable
critics
were
the
best
said
he
justice
is
the
soul
of
good
criticism
and
it
is
only
justice
that
i
ask
and
expect
from
what
good
does
this
speaking
do
inquired
she
are
you
any
nearer
the
end
of
your
difficulties
by
means
of
your
speeches
i
hardly
know
yet
just
now
we
are
in
dead
water
but
this
ca
last
long
in
fact
i
am
not
afraid
to
tell
you
though
of
course
you
will
not
repeat
it
to
any
human
being
that
we
have
taken
measures
to
force
an
issue
certain
gentlemen
myself
among
the
rest
have
written
letters
meant
for
the
president
eye
though
not
addressed
directly
to
him
and
intended
to
draw
out
an
expression
of
some
sort
that
will
show
us
what
to
oh
laughed
madeleine
i
knew
about
that
a
week
about
what
about
your
letter
to
sam
grimes
of
north
what
have
you
heard
about
my
letter
to
sam
grimes
of
north
bend
ejaculated
ratcliffe
a
little
abruptly
oh
you
do
not
know
how
admirably
i
have
organised
my
secret
service
bureau
said
she
representative
cutter
one
of
the
senate
pages
and
obliged
him
to
confess
that
he
had
received
from
you
a
letter
to
be
posted
which
letter
was
addressed
to
grimes
of
north
and
of
course
he
told
this
to
french
and
french
told
you
said
ratcliffe
i
see
if
i
had
known
this
i
would
not
have
let
french
off
so
gently
last
night
for
i
prefer
to
tell
you
my
own
story
without
his
embellishments
but
it
was
my
fault
i
should
not
have
trusted
a
page
nothing
is
a
secret
here
long
but
one
thing
that
cutter
did
not
find
out
was
that
several
other
gentlemen
wrote
letters
at
the
same
time
for
the
same
purpose
your
friend
clinton
wrote
krebs
wrote
and
one
or
two
i
suppose
i
must
not
ask
what
you
said
you
may
we
agreed
that
it
was
best
to
be
very
mild
and
conciliatory
and
to
urge
the
president
only
to
give
us
some
indication
of
his
intentions
in
order
that
we
might
not
run
counter
to
them
i
drew
a
strong
picture
of
the
effect
of
the
present
situation
on
the
party
and
hinted
that
i
had
no
personal
wishes
to
and
what
do
you
think
will
be
the
result
i
think
we
shall
somehow
manage
to
straighten
things
out
said
ratcliffe
the
difficulty
is
only
that
the
new
president
has
little
experience
and
is
suspicious
he
thinks
we
shall
intrigue
to
tie
his
hands
and
he
means
to
tie
ours
in
advance
i
do
know
him
personally
but
those
who
do
and
who
are
fair
judges
say
that
though
rather
narrow
and
obstinate
he
is
honest
enough
and
will
come
round
i
have
no
doubt
i
could
settle
it
all
with
him
in
an
hour
talk
but
it
is
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
go
to
him
unless
i
am
asked
and
to
ask
me
to
come
would
be
itself
a
what
then
is
the
danger
you
fear
that
he
will
offend
all
the
important
party
leaders
in
order
to
conciliate
unimportant
ones
perhaps
sentimental
ones
like
your
friend
french
that
he
will
make
foolish
appointments
without
taking
advice
by
the
way
have
you
seen
french
no
replied
madeleine
i
think
he
must
be
sore
at
your
treatment
of
him
last
evening
you
were
very
rude
to
not
a
bit
said
ratcliffe
these
reformers
need
it
his
attack
on
me
was
meant
for
a
challenge
i
saw
it
in
his
manner
but
is
reform
really
so
impossible
as
you
describe
it
is
it
quite
hopeless
reform
such
as
he
wants
is
utterly
hopeless
and
not
even
lee
with
much
earnestness
of
manner
still
pressed
her
question
surely
something
can
be
done
to
check
corruption
are
we
for
ever
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
thieves
and
ruffians
is
a
respectable
government
impossible
in
a
democracy
her
warmth
attracted
jacobi
attention
and
he
spoke
across
the
room
what
is
that
you
say
lee
what
is
it
about
corruption
all
the
gentlemen
began
to
listen
and
gather
about
them
i
am
asking
senator
ratcliffe
said
she
what
is
to
become
of
us
if
corruption
is
allowed
to
go
and
may
i
venture
to
ask
permission
to
hear
ratcliffe
reply
asked
the
baron
my
reply
said
ratcliffe
is
that
no
representative
government
can
long
be
much
better
or
much
worse
than
the
society
it
represents
purify
society
and
you
purify
the
government
but
try
to
purify
the
government
artificially
and
you
only
aggravate
a
very
statesmanlike
reply
said
baron
jacobi
with
a
formal
bow
but
his
tone
had
a
shade
of
mockery
carrington
who
had
listened
with
a
darkening
face
suddenly
turned
to
the
baron
and
asked
him
what
conclusion
he
drew
from
the
reply
ah
exclaimed
the
baron
with
his
wickedest
leer
what
for
is
my
conclusion
good
you
americans
believe
yourselves
to
be
excepted
from
the
operation
of
general
laws
you
care
not
for
experience
i
have
lived
years
and
all
that
time
in
the
midst
of
corruption
i
am
corrupt
myself
only
i
do
have
courage
to
proclaim
it
and
you
others
have
it
not
rome
paris
vienna
petersburg
london
all
are
corrupt
only
washington
is
pure
well
i
declare
to
you
that
in
all
my
experience
i
have
found
no
society
which
has
had
elements
of
corruption
like
the
united
states
the
children
in
the
street
are
corrupt
and
know
how
to
cheat
me
the
cities
are
all
corrupt
and
also
the
towns
and
the
counties
and
the
states
legislatures
and
the
judges
everywhere
men
betray
trusts
both
public
and
private
steal
money
run
away
with
public
funds
only
in
the
senate
men
take
no
money
and
you
gentlemen
in
the
senate
very
well
declare
that
your
great
united
states
which
is
the
head
of
the
civilized
world
can
never
learn
anything
from
the
example
of
corrupt
europe
you
are
right
quite
right
the
great
united
states
needs
not
an
example
i
do
much
regret
that
i
have
not
yet
one
hundred
years
to
live
if
i
could
then
come
back
to
this
city
i
should
find
myself
very
content
much
more
than
now
i
am
always
content
where
there
is
much
corruption
and
ma
parole
broke
out
the
old
man
with
fire
and
gesture
the
united
states
will
then
be
more
corrupt
than
rome
under
caligula
more
corrupt
than
the
church
under
leo
more
corrupt
than
france
under
the
regent
as
the
baron
closed
his
little
harangue
which
he
delivered
directly
at
the
senator
sitting
underneath
him
he
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
that
every
one
was
silent
and
listening
with
deep
attention
he
seemed
to
enjoy
annoying
the
senator
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
the
senator
was
visibly
annoyed
ratcliffe
looked
sternly
at
the
baron
and
said
with
some
curtness
that
he
saw
no
reason
to
accept
such
conclusions
conversation
flagged
and
all
except
the
baron
were
relieved
when
sybil
at
schneidekoupon
request
sat
down
at
the
piano
to
sing
what
she
called
a
hymn
so
soon
as
the
song
was
over
ratcliffe
who
seemed
to
have
been
curiously
thrown
off
his
balance
by
jacobi
harangue
pleaded
urgent
duties
at
his
rooms
and
retired
the
others
soon
afterwards
went
off
in
a
body
leaving
only
carrington
and
gore
who
had
seated
himself
by
madeleine
and
was
at
once
dragged
by
her
into
a
discussion
of
the
subject
which
perplexed
her
and
for
the
moment
threw
over
her
mind
a
net
of
irresistible
fascination
the
baron
discomfited
the
senator
said
gore
with
a
certain
hesitation
why
did
ratcliffe
let
himself
be
trampled
upon
in
that
manner
i
wish
you
would
explain
why
replied
lee
tell
me
gore
you
who
represent
cultivation
and
literary
taste
hereabouts
please
tell
me
what
to
think
about
baron
jacobi
speech
who
and
what
is
to
be
believed
ratcliffe
seems
honest
and
wise
is
he
a
corruptionist
he
believes
in
the
people
or
says
he
does
is
he
telling
the
truth
or
not
gore
was
too
experienced
in
politics
to
be
caught
in
such
a
trap
as
this
he
evaded
the
question
mr
ratcliffe
has
a
practical
piece
of
work
to
do
his
business
is
to
make
laws
and
advise
the
president
he
does
it
extremely
well
we
have
no
other
equally
good
practical
politician
it
is
unfair
to
require
him
to
be
a
crusader
no
interposed
carrington
curtly
but
he
need
not
obstruct
crusades
he
need
not
talk
virtue
and
oppose
the
punishment
of
he
is
a
shrewd
practical
politician
replied
gore
and
he
feels
first
the
weak
side
of
any
proposed
political
with
a
sigh
of
despair
madeleine
went
on
who
then
is
right
how
can
we
all
be
right
half
of
our
wise
men
declare
that
the
world
is
going
straight
to
perdition
the
other
half
that
it
is
fast
becoming
perfect
both
can
not
be
right
there
is
only
one
thing
in
life
she
went
on
laughing
that
i
must
and
will
have
before
i
die
i
must
know
whether
america
is
right
or
wrong
just
now
this
question
is
a
very
practical
one
for
i
really
want
to
know
whether
to
believe
in
ratcliffe
if
i
throw
him
overboard
everything
must
go
for
he
is
only
a
why
not
believe
in
ratcliffe
said
gore
i
believe
in
him
myself
and
am
not
afraid
to
say
carrington
to
whom
ratcliffe
now
began
to
represent
the
spirit
of
evil
interposed
here
and
observed
that
he
imagined
gore
had
other
guides
besides
and
steadier
ones
than
ratcliffe
to
believe
in
while
madeleine
with
a
certain
feminine
perspicacity
struck
at
a
much
weaker
point
in
gore
armour
and
asked
whether
he
believed
also
in
what
ratcliffe
represented
do
you
yourself
think
democracy
the
best
government
and
universal
suffrage
a
success
gore
saw
himself
pinned
to
the
wall
and
he
turned
at
bay
with
almost
the
energy
of
despair
these
are
matters
about
which
i
rarely
talk
in
society
they
are
like
the
doctrine
of
a
personal
god
of
a
future
life
of
revealed
religion
subjects
which
one
naturally
reserves
for
private
reflection
but
since
you
ask
for
my
political
creed
you
shall
have
it
i
only
condition
that
it
shall
be
for
you
alone
never
to
be
repeated
or
quoted
as
mine
i
believe
in
democracy
i
accept
it
i
will
faithfully
serve
and
defend
it
i
believe
in
it
because
it
appears
to
me
the
inevitable
consequence
of
what
has
gone
before
it
democracy
asserts
the
fact
that
the
masses
are
now
raised
to
a
higher
intelligence
than
formerly
all
our
civilisation
aims
at
this
mark
we
want
to
do
what
we
can
to
help
it
i
myself
want
to
see
the
result
i
grant
it
is
an
experiment
but
it
is
the
only
direction
society
can
take
that
is
worth
its
taking
the
only
conception
of
its
duty
large
enough
to
satisfy
its
instincts
the
only
result
that
is
worth
an
effort
or
a
risk
every
other
possible
step
is
backward
and
i
do
not
care
to
repeat
the
past
i
am
glad
to
see
society
grapple
with
issues
in
which
no
one
can
afford
to
be
and
supposing
your
experiment
fails
said
lee
suppose
society
destroys
itself
with
universal
suffrage
corruption
and
i
wish
lee
you
would
visit
the
observatory
with
me
some
evening
and
look
at
sirius
did
you
ever
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
fixed
star
i
believe
astronomers
reckon
about
twenty
millions
of
them
in
sight
and
an
infinite
possibility
of
invisible
millions
each
one
of
which
is
a
sun
like
ours
and
may
have
satellites
like
our
planet
suppose
you
see
one
of
these
fixed
stars
suddenly
increase
in
brightness
and
are
told
that
a
satellite
has
fallen
into
it
and
is
burning
up
its
career
finished
its
capacities
exhausted
curious
is
it
not
but
what
does
it
matter
just
as
much
as
the
burning
up
of
a
moth
at
your
madeleine
shuddered
a
little
i
can
not
get
to
the
height
of
your
philosophy
said
she
you
are
wandering
among
the
infinites
and
i
am
not
at
all
but
i
have
faith
not
perhaps
in
the
old
dogmas
but
in
the
new
ones
faith
in
human
nature
faith
in
science
faith
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
let
us
be
true
to
our
time
lee
if
our
age
is
to
be
beaten
let
us
die
in
the
ranks
if
it
is
to
be
victorious
let
us
be
first
to
lead
the
column
anyway
let
us
not
be
skulkers
or
grumblers
there
have
i
repeated
my
catechism
correctly
you
would
have
it
now
oblige
me
by
forgetting
it
i
should
lose
my
character
at
home
if
it
got
out
good
night
lee
duly
appeared
at
the
capitol
the
next
day
as
she
could
not
but
do
after
senator
ratcliffe
pointed
request
she
went
alone
for
sybil
had
positively
refused
to
go
near
the
capitol
again
and
madeleine
thought
that
on
the
whole
this
was
not
an
occasion
for
enrolling
carrington
in
her
service
but
ratcliffe
did
not
speak
the
debate
was
unexpectedly
postponed
he
joined
lee
in
the
gallery
however
sat
with
her
as
long
as
she
would
allow
and
became
still
more
confidential
telling
her
that
he
had
received
the
expected
reply
from
grimes
of
north
bend
and
that
it
had
enclosed
a
letter
written
by
the
to
grimes
in
regard
to
the
advances
made
by
ratcliffe
and
his
friends
it
is
not
a
handsome
letter
said
he
indeed
a
part
of
it
is
positively
insulting
i
would
like
to
read
you
one
extract
from
it
and
hear
your
opinion
as
to
how
it
should
be
taking
the
letter
from
his
pocket
he
sought
out
the
passage
and
read
as
follows
can
not
lose
sight
too
of
the
consideration
that
these
three
he
means
clinton
krebs
and
me
are
popularly
considered
to
be
the
most
influential
members
of
that
senatorial
ring
which
has
acquired
such
general
notoriety
while
i
shall
always
receive
their
communications
with
all
due
respect
i
must
continue
to
exercise
complete
freedom
of
action
in
consulting
other
political
advisers
as
well
as
these
and
i
must
in
all
cases
make
it
my
first
object
to
follow
the
wishes
of
the
people
not
always
most
truly
represented
by
their
nominal
representatives
what
say
you
to
that
precious
piece
of
presidential
manners
at
least
i
like
his
courage
said
lee
courage
is
one
thing
common
sense
is
another
this
letter
is
a
studied
insult
he
has
knocked
me
off
the
track
once
he
means
to
do
it
again
it
is
a
declaration
of
war
what
ought
i
to
do
whatever
is
most
for
the
public
said
madeleine
gravely
ratcliffe
looked
into
her
face
with
such
undisguised
delight
there
was
so
little
possibility
of
mistaking
or
ignoring
the
expression
of
his
eyes
that
she
shrank
back
with
a
certain
shock
she
was
not
prepared
for
so
open
a
demonstration
he
hardened
his
features
at
once
and
went
on
but
what
is
most
for
the
public
good
that
you
know
better
than
i
said
madeleine
only
one
thing
is
clear
to
me
if
you
let
yourself
be
ruled
by
your
private
feelings
you
will
make
a
greater
mistake
than
he
now
i
must
go
for
i
have
visits
to
make
the
next
time
i
come
ratcliffe
you
must
keep
your
word
when
they
next
met
ratcliffe
read
to
her
a
part
of
his
reply
to
grimes
which
ran
thus
it
is
the
lot
of
every
party
leader
to
suffer
from
attacks
and
to
commit
errors
it
is
true
as
the
president
says
that
i
have
been
no
exception
to
this
law
believing
as
i
do
that
great
results
can
only
be
accomplished
by
great
parties
i
have
uniformly
yielded
my
own
personal
opinions
where
they
have
failed
to
obtain
general
assent
i
shall
continue
to
follow
this
course
and
the
president
may
with
perfect
confidence
count
upon
my
disinterested
support
of
all
party
measures
even
though
i
may
not
be
consulted
in
originating
lee
listened
attentively
and
then
said
have
you
never
refused
to
go
with
your
party
never
was
ratcliffe
firm
reply
madeleine
still
more
thoughtfully
inquired
again
is
nothing
more
powerful
than
party
allegiance
nothing
except
national
allegiance
replied
ratcliffe
still
more
firmly
chapter
v
to
tie
a
prominent
statesman
to
her
train
and
to
lead
him
about
like
a
tame
bear
is
for
a
young
and
vivacious
woman
a
more
certain
amusement
than
to
tie
herself
to
him
and
to
be
dragged
about
like
an
indian
squaw
this
fact
was
madeleine
lee
first
great
political
discovery
in
washington
and
it
was
worth
to
her
all
the
german
philosophy
she
had
ever
read
with
even
a
complete
edition
of
herbert
spencer
works
into
the
bargain
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
honours
and
dignities
of
a
public
career
were
no
fair
consideration
for
its
pains
she
made
a
little
daily
task
for
herself
of
reading
in
succession
the
lives
and
letters
of
the
american
presidents
and
of
their
wives
when
she
could
find
that
there
was
a
trace
of
the
latter
existence
what
a
melancholy
spectacle
it
was
from
george
washington
down
to
the
last
incumbent
what
vexations
what
disappointments
what
grievous
mistakes
what
very
objectionable
manners
not
one
of
them
who
had
aimed
at
high
purpose
but
had
been
thwarted
beaten
and
habitually
insulted
what
a
gloom
lay
on
the
features
of
those
famous
chieftains
calhoun
clay
and
webster
what
varied
expression
of
defeat
and
unsatisfied
desire
what
a
sense
of
and
senatorial
magniloquence
what
a
craving
for
flattery
what
despair
at
the
sentence
of
fate
and
what
did
they
amount
to
after
all
they
were
practical
men
these
they
had
no
great
problems
of
thought
to
settle
no
questions
that
rose
above
the
ordinary
rules
of
common
morals
and
homely
duty
how
they
had
managed
to
befog
the
subject
what
elaborate
they
had
built
up
with
no
result
but
to
obscure
the
horizon
would
not
the
country
have
done
better
without
them
could
it
have
done
worse
what
deeper
abyss
could
have
opened
under
the
nation
feet
than
that
to
whose
verge
they
brought
it
madeleine
mind
wearied
with
the
monotony
of
the
story
she
discussed
the
subject
with
ratcliffe
who
told
her
frankly
that
the
pleasure
of
politics
lay
in
the
possession
of
power
he
agreed
that
the
country
would
do
very
well
without
him
but
here
i
am
said
he
and
here
i
mean
to
he
had
very
little
sympathy
for
thin
moralising
and
a
statesmanlike
contempt
for
philosophical
politics
he
loved
power
and
he
meant
to
be
president
that
was
enough
sometimes
the
tragic
and
sometimes
the
comic
side
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
and
sometimes
she
did
not
herself
know
whether
to
cry
or
to
laugh
washington
more
than
any
other
city
in
the
world
swarms
with
exhibitions
of
human
nature
men
and
women
curiously
out
of
place
whom
it
would
be
cruel
to
ridicule
and
ridiculous
to
weep
over
the
sadder
exhibitions
are
fortunately
seldom
seen
by
respectable
people
only
the
little
social
accidents
come
under
their
eyes
one
evening
lee
went
to
the
president
first
evening
reception
as
sybil
flatly
refused
to
face
the
crowd
and
carrington
mildly
said
that
he
feared
he
was
not
sufficiently
reconstructed
to
appear
at
home
in
that
august
presence
lee
accepted
french
for
an
escort
and
walked
across
the
square
with
him
to
join
the
throng
that
was
pouring
into
the
doors
of
the
white
house
they
took
their
places
in
the
line
of
citizens
and
were
at
last
able
to
enter
the
there
madeleine
found
herself
before
two
seemingly
mechanical
figures
which
might
be
wood
or
wax
for
any
sign
they
showed
of
life
these
two
figures
were
the
president
and
his
wife
they
stood
stiff
and
awkward
by
the
door
both
their
faces
stripped
of
every
sign
of
intelligence
while
the
right
hands
of
both
extended
themselves
to
the
column
of
visitors
with
the
mechanical
action
of
toy
dolls
lee
for
a
moment
began
to
laugh
but
the
laugh
died
on
her
lips
to
the
president
and
his
wife
this
was
clearly
no
laughing
matter
there
they
stood
automata
representatives
of
the
society
which
streamed
past
them
madeleine
seized
french
by
the
arm
take
me
somewhere
at
once
said
she
where
i
can
look
at
it
here
in
the
corner
i
had
no
conception
how
shocking
it
was
french
supposed
she
was
thinking
of
the
men
and
women
who
were
swarming
through
the
rooms
and
he
made
after
his
own
delicate
notion
of
humour
some
uncouth
jests
on
those
who
passed
by
lee
however
was
in
no
humour
to
explain
or
even
to
listen
she
stopped
him
short
there
french
now
go
away
and
leave
me
i
want
to
be
alone
for
half
an
hour
please
come
for
me
and
there
she
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
president
and
his
wife
while
the
endless
stream
of
humanity
passed
them
shaking
hands
what
a
strange
and
solemn
spectacle
it
was
and
how
the
deadly
fascination
of
it
burned
the
image
in
upon
her
mind
what
a
horrid
warning
to
ambition
and
in
all
that
crowd
there
was
no
one
besides
herself
who
felt
the
mockery
of
this
exhibition
to
all
the
others
this
task
was
a
regular
part
of
the
president
duty
and
there
was
nothing
ridiculous
about
it
they
thought
it
a
democratic
institution
this
droll
a
ping
of
monarchical
forms
to
them
the
deadly
dulness
of
the
show
was
as
natural
and
proper
as
ever
to
the
courtiers
of
the
philips
and
charleses
seemed
the
ceremonies
of
the
escurial
to
her
it
had
the
effect
of
a
nightmare
or
of
an
vision
she
felt
a
sudden
conviction
that
this
was
to
be
the
end
of
american
society
its
realisation
and
dream
at
once
she
groaned
in
spirit
yes
at
last
i
have
reached
the
end
we
shall
grow
to
be
wax
images
and
our
talk
will
be
like
the
squeaking
of
toy
dolls
we
shall
all
wander
round
and
round
the
earth
and
shake
hands
no
one
will
have
any
object
in
this
world
and
there
will
be
no
other
it
is
worse
than
anything
in
the
what
an
awful
vision
of
eternity
suddenly
as
through
a
mist
she
saw
the
melancholy
face
of
lord
skye
approaching
he
came
to
her
side
and
his
voice
recalled
her
to
reality
does
it
amuse
you
this
sort
of
thing
he
asked
in
a
vague
way
we
take
our
amusement
sadly
after
the
manner
of
our
people
she
replied
but
it
certainly
interests
they
stood
for
a
time
in
silence
watching
the
slowly
eddying
dance
of
democracy
until
he
resumed
whom
do
you
take
that
man
to
be
the
long
lean
one
with
a
long
woman
on
each
arm
that
man
she
replied
i
take
to
be
a
washington
or
perhaps
a
member
of
congress
from
iowa
with
a
wife
and
wife
sister
do
they
shock
your
nobility
he
looked
at
her
with
comical
resignation
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
they
are
quite
as
good
as
i
grant
it
my
aristocratic
spirit
is
broken
lee
i
will
even
ask
them
to
dinner
if
you
bid
me
and
if
you
will
come
to
meet
them
but
the
last
time
i
asked
a
member
of
congress
to
dine
he
sent
me
back
a
note
in
pencil
on
my
own
envelope
that
he
would
bring
two
of
his
friends
with
him
very
respectable
constituents
from
yahoo
city
or
some
such
place
noblemen
he
you
should
have
welcomed
i
did
i
wanted
to
see
two
of
nature
noblemen
and
i
knew
they
would
probably
be
pleasanter
company
than
their
representative
they
came
very
respectable
persons
one
with
a
blue
necktie
the
other
with
a
red
one
both
had
diamond
pins
in
their
shirts
and
were
carefully
brushed
in
respect
to
their
hair
they
said
nothing
ate
little
drank
less
and
were
much
better
behaved
than
i
am
when
they
went
away
they
unanimously
asked
me
to
stay
with
them
when
i
visited
yahoo
you
will
not
want
guests
if
you
always
do
i
do
know
i
think
it
was
pure
ignorance
on
their
part
they
knew
no
better
and
they
seemed
modest
enough
my
only
complaint
was
that
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
them
i
wonder
whether
their
wives
would
have
been
more
would
they
be
so
in
england
lord
skye
he
looked
down
at
her
with
eyes
and
drawled
you
know
my
countrywomen
hardly
at
then
let
us
discuss
some
less
serious
willingly
i
have
waited
for
you
to
explain
to
me
why
you
have
an
expression
of
such
is
that
quite
friendly
lee
do
i
really
look
melancholy
unutterably
as
i
feel
i
am
consumed
with
curiosity
to
know
the
the
british
minister
coolly
took
a
complete
survey
of
the
whole
room
ending
with
a
prolonged
stare
at
the
president
and
his
wife
who
were
still
mechanically
shaking
hands
then
he
looked
back
into
her
face
and
said
never
a
word
she
insisted
i
must
have
this
riddle
answered
it
suffocates
me
i
should
not
be
sad
at
seeing
these
same
people
at
work
or
at
play
if
they
ever
do
play
or
in
a
church
or
a
why
do
they
weigh
on
me
like
a
horrid
phantom
here
i
see
no
riddle
lee
you
have
answered
your
own
question
they
are
neither
at
work
nor
at
then
please
take
me
home
at
once
i
shall
have
hysterics
the
sight
of
those
two
suffering
images
at
the
door
is
too
mournful
to
be
borne
i
am
dizzy
with
looking
at
these
stalking
figures
i
do
believe
real
i
wish
the
house
would
take
fire
i
want
an
earthquake
i
wish
some
one
would
pinch
the
president
or
pull
his
wife
lee
did
not
repeat
the
experiment
of
visiting
the
white
house
and
indeed
for
some
time
afterwards
she
spoke
with
little
enthusiasm
of
the
presidential
office
to
senator
ratcliffe
she
expressed
her
opinions
strongly
the
senator
tried
in
vain
to
argue
that
the
people
had
a
right
to
call
upon
their
chief
magistrate
and
that
he
was
bound
to
receive
them
this
being
so
there
was
no
less
objectionable
way
of
proceeding
than
the
one
which
had
been
chosen
who
gave
the
people
any
such
right
asked
lee
where
does
it
come
from
what
do
they
want
it
for
you
know
better
ratcliffe
our
chief
magistrate
is
a
citizen
like
any
one
else
what
puts
it
into
his
foolish
head
to
cease
being
a
citizen
and
to
ape
royalty
our
governors
never
make
themselves
ridiculous
why
can
not
the
wretched
being
content
himself
with
living
like
the
rest
of
us
and
minding
his
own
business
does
he
know
what
a
figure
of
fun
he
is
and
lee
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
she
would
like
to
be
the
president
wife
only
to
put
an
end
to
this
folly
nothing
should
ever
induce
her
to
go
through
such
a
performance
and
if
the
public
did
not
approve
of
this
congress
might
impeach
her
and
remove
her
from
office
all
she
demanded
was
the
right
to
be
heard
before
the
senate
in
her
own
defence
nevertheless
there
was
a
very
general
impression
in
washington
that
lee
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
be
in
the
white
house
known
to
comparatively
few
people
and
rarely
discussing
even
with
them
the
subjects
which
deeply
interested
her
madeleine
passed
for
a
clever
intriguing
woman
who
had
her
own
objects
to
gain
true
it
is
beyond
peradventure
that
all
residents
of
washington
may
be
assumed
to
be
in
office
or
candidates
for
office
unless
they
avow
their
object
they
are
guilty
of
an
attempt
and
a
stupid
one
to
deceive
yet
there
is
a
small
class
of
apparent
exceptions
destined
at
last
to
fall
within
the
rule
lee
was
properly
assumed
to
be
a
candidate
for
office
to
the
washingtonians
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
lee
should
marry
silas
ratcliffe
that
he
should
be
glad
to
get
a
fashionable
and
intelligent
wife
with
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
a
year
was
not
surprising
that
she
should
accept
the
first
public
man
of
the
day
with
a
flattering
chance
for
the
presidency
a
man
still
comparatively
young
and
not
without
good
looks
was
perfectly
natural
and
in
her
undertaking
she
had
the
sympathy
of
all
washington
women
who
were
not
possible
rivals
for
to
them
the
president
wife
is
of
more
consequence
than
the
president
and
indeed
if
america
only
knew
it
they
are
not
very
far
from
the
truth
some
there
were
however
who
did
not
assent
to
this
though
worldly
view
of
the
proposed
match
these
ladies
were
severe
in
their
comments
upon
lee
conduct
and
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
their
opinion
that
she
was
the
calmest
and
most
ambitious
minx
who
had
ever
come
within
their
observation
unfortunately
it
happened
that
the
respectable
and
proper
schuyler
clinton
took
this
view
of
the
case
and
made
little
attempt
to
conceal
her
opinion
she
was
justly
indignant
at
her
cousin
gross
worldliness
and
possible
promotion
in
rank
if
madeleine
ross
marries
that
coarse
horrid
old
illinois
politician
said
she
to
her
husband
i
never
will
forgive
her
so
long
as
i
clinton
tried
to
excuse
madeleine
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
difference
of
age
was
no
greater
than
in
their
own
case
but
his
wife
trampled
ruthlessly
on
his
argument
at
any
rate
said
she
i
never
came
to
washington
as
a
widow
on
purpose
to
set
my
cap
for
the
first
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
i
never
made
a
public
spectacle
of
my
indecent
eagerness
in
the
very
galleries
of
the
senate
and
lee
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
she
is
a
heartless
unfeminine
little
victoria
dare
who
babbled
like
the
winds
and
streams
with
utter
indifference
as
to
what
she
said
or
whom
she
addressed
used
to
bring
choice
bits
of
this
gossip
to
lee
she
always
affected
a
little
stammer
when
she
said
anything
uncommonly
impudent
and
put
on
a
manner
of
languid
simplicity
she
felt
keenly
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
madeleine
charged
with
her
own
besetting
sins
for
years
all
washington
had
agreed
that
victoria
was
little
better
than
one
of
the
wicked
she
had
done
nothing
but
violate
every
rule
of
propriety
and
scandalise
every
family
in
the
city
and
there
was
no
good
in
her
yet
it
could
not
be
denied
that
victoria
was
amusing
and
had
a
sort
of
irregular
fascination
consequently
she
was
universally
tolerated
to
see
lee
thrust
down
to
her
own
level
was
an
unmixed
pleasure
to
her
and
she
carefully
repeated
to
madeleine
the
choice
bits
of
dialogue
which
she
picked
up
in
her
wanderings
your
cousin
clinton
says
you
are
a
i
do
believe
it
victoria
clinton
never
said
anything
of
the
mrs
marston
says
it
is
because
you
have
caught
a
and
senator
clinton
was
only
a
naturally
all
this
unexpected
publicity
irritated
lee
not
a
little
especially
when
short
and
vague
paragraphs
soon
followed
by
longer
and
more
positive
ones
in
regard
to
senator
ratcliffe
matrimonial
prospects
began
to
appear
in
newspapers
along
with
descriptions
of
herself
from
the
pens
of
enterprising
female
correspondents
for
the
press
who
had
never
so
much
as
seen
her
at
the
first
sight
of
one
of
these
newspaper
articles
madeleine
fairly
cried
with
mortification
and
anger
she
wanted
to
leave
washington
the
next
day
and
she
hated
the
very
thought
of
ratcliffe
there
was
something
in
the
newspaper
style
so
inscrutably
vulgar
something
so
inexplicably
revolting
to
the
sense
of
feminine
decency
that
she
shrank
under
it
as
though
it
were
a
poisonous
spider
but
after
the
first
acute
shame
had
passed
her
temper
was
roused
and
she
vowed
that
she
would
pursue
her
own
path
just
as
she
had
begun
without
regard
to
all
the
malignity
and
vulgarity
in
the
wide
united
states
she
did
not
care
to
marry
senator
ratcliffe
she
liked
his
society
and
was
flattered
by
his
confidence
she
rather
hoped
to
prevent
him
from
ever
making
a
formal
offer
and
if
not
she
would
at
least
push
it
off
to
the
last
possible
moment
but
she
was
not
to
be
frightened
from
marrying
him
by
any
amount
of
spitefulness
or
gossip
and
she
did
not
mean
to
refuse
him
except
for
stronger
reasons
than
these
she
even
went
so
far
in
her
desperate
courage
as
to
laugh
at
her
cousin
clinton
whose
venerable
husband
she
allowed
and
even
encouraged
to
pay
her
such
public
attention
and
to
express
sentiments
of
such
youthful
ardour
as
she
well
knew
would
inflame
and
exasperate
the
excellent
lady
his
wife
carrington
was
the
person
most
unpleasantly
affected
by
the
course
which
this
affair
had
taken
he
could
no
longer
conceal
from
himself
the
fact
that
he
was
as
much
m
love
as
a
dignified
virginian
could
be
with
him
at
all
events
she
had
shown
no
coquetry
nor
had
she
ever
either
flattered
or
encouraged
him
but
carrington
m
his
solitary
struggle
against
fate
had
found
her
a
warm
friend
always
ready
to
assist
where
assistance
was
needed
generous
with
her
money
in
any
cause
which
he
was
willing
to
vouch
for
full
of
sympathy
where
sympathy
was
more
than
money
and
full
of
resource
and
suggestion
where
money
and
sympathy
failed
carrington
knew
her
better
than
she
knew
herself
he
selected
her
books
he
brought
the
last
speech
or
the
last
report
from
the
capitol
or
the
departments
he
knew
her
doubts
and
her
vagaries
and
as
far
as
he
understood
them
at
all
helped
her
to
solve
them
carrington
was
too
modest
and
perhaps
too
shy
to
act
the
part
of
a
declared
lover
and
he
was
too
proud
to
let
it
be
thought
that
he
wanted
to
exchange
his
poverty
for
her
wealth
but
he
was
all
the
more
anxious
when
he
saw
the
evident
attraction
which
ratcliffe
strong
will
and
unscrupulous
energy
exercised
over
her
he
saw
that
ratcliffe
was
steadily
pushing
his
advances
that
he
flattered
all
weaknesses
by
the
confidence
and
deference
with
which
he
treated
her
and
that
in
a
very
short
time
madeleine
must
either
marry
him
or
find
herself
looked
upon
as
a
heartless
coquette
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
thinking
ill
of
senator
ratcliffe
and
he
meant
to
prevent
a
marriage
but
he
had
an
enemy
to
deal
with
not
easily
driven
from
the
path
and
quite
capable
of
routing
any
number
of
rivals
ratcliffe
was
afraid
of
no
one
he
had
not
fought
his
own
way
in
life
for
nothing
and
he
knew
all
the
value
of
a
cold
head
and
dogged
nothing
but
this
robust
americanism
and
his
strong
will
carried
him
safely
through
the
snares
and
pitfalls
of
lee
society
where
rivals
and
enemies
beset
him
on
every
hand
he
was
little
better
than
a
schoolboy
when
he
ventured
on
their
ground
but
when
he
could
draw
them
over
upon
his
own
territory
of
practical
life
he
rarely
failed
to
trample
on
his
assailants
it
was
this
practical
sense
and
cool
will
that
won
over
lee
who
was
woman
enough
to
assume
that
all
the
graces
were
well
enough
employed
in
decorating
her
and
it
was
enough
if
the
other
sex
felt
her
superiority
men
were
valuable
only
in
proportion
to
their
strength
and
their
appreciation
of
women
if
the
senator
had
only
been
strong
enough
always
to
control
his
temper
he
would
have
done
very
well
but
his
temper
was
under
a
great
strain
in
these
times
and
his
incessant
effort
to
control
it
in
politics
made
him
less
watchful
in
private
life
lee
tacit
assumption
of
superior
refinement
irritated
him
and
sometimes
made
him
show
his
teeth
like
a
at
the
cost
of
receiving
from
lee
a
quick
stroke
in
return
such
as
a
cat
administers
to
check
innocent
to
the
eye
but
drawing
blood
one
evening
when
he
was
more
than
commonly
out
of
sorts
after
sitting
some
time
in
moody
silence
he
roused
himself
and
taking
up
a
book
that
lay
on
her
table
he
glanced
at
its
title
and
turned
over
the
leaves
it
happened
by
ill
luck
to
be
a
volume
of
darwin
that
lee
had
just
borrowed
from
the
library
of
congress
do
you
understand
this
sort
of
thing
asked
the
senator
abruptly
in
a
tone
that
suggested
a
sneer
not
very
well
replied
lee
rather
curtly
why
do
you
want
to
understand
it
persisted
the
senator
what
good
will
it
do
you
perhaps
it
will
teach
us
to
be
modest
answered
madeleine
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
because
it
says
we
descend
from
monkeys
rejoined
the
senator
roughly
do
you
think
you
are
descended
from
monkeys
why
not
said
madeleine
why
not
repeated
ratcliffe
laughing
harshly
i
do
like
the
connection
do
you
mean
to
introduce
your
distant
relations
into
society
they
would
bring
more
amusement
into
it
than
most
of
its
present
members
rejoined
lee
with
a
gentle
smile
that
threatened
mischief
but
ratcliffe
would
not
be
warned
on
the
contrary
the
only
effect
of
lee
defiance
was
to
exasperate
his
and
whenever
he
lost
his
temper
he
became
senatorial
and
websterian
such
books
he
began
disgrace
our
civilization
they
degrade
and
stultify
our
divine
nature
they
are
only
suited
for
asiatic
despotisms
where
men
are
reduced
to
the
level
of
brutes
that
they
should
be
accepted
by
a
man
like
baron
jacobi
i
can
understand
he
and
his
masters
have
nothing
to
do
in
the
world
but
to
trample
on
human
rights
carrington
of
course
would
approve
those
ideas
he
believes
in
the
divine
doctrine
of
flogging
negroes
but
that
you
who
profess
philanthropy
and
free
principles
should
go
with
them
is
astonishing
it
is
incredible
it
is
unworthy
of
you
are
very
hard
on
the
monkeys
replied
madeleine
rather
sternly
when
the
senator
oration
was
ended
the
monkeys
never
did
you
any
harm
they
are
not
in
public
life
they
are
not
even
voters
if
they
were
you
would
be
enthusiastic
about
their
intelligence
and
virtue
after
all
we
ought
to
be
grateful
to
them
for
what
would
men
do
in
this
melancholy
world
if
they
had
not
inherited
gaiety
from
the
monkeys
as
well
as
ratcliffe
to
do
him
justice
took
punishment
well
at
least
when
it
came
from
lee
hands
and
his
occasional
outbursts
of
insubordination
were
sure
to
be
followed
by
improved
discipline
but
if
he
allowed
lee
to
correct
his
faults
he
had
no
notion
of
letting
himself
be
instructed
by
her
friends
and
he
lost
no
chance
of
telling
them
so
but
to
do
this
was
not
always
enough
whether
it
were
that
he
had
few
ideas
outside
of
his
own
experience
or
that
he
would
not
trust
himself
on
doubtful
ground
he
seemed
compelled
to
bring
every
discussion
down
to
his
own
level
madeleine
puzzled
herself
in
vain
to
find
out
whether
he
did
this
because
he
knew
no
better
or
because
he
meant
to
cover
his
own
ignorance
the
baron
has
amused
me
very
much
with
his
account
of
bucharest
society
lee
would
say
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
i
would
like
to
show
him
our
society
in
peonia
was
ratcliffe
reply
he
would
find
a
very
brilliant
circle
there
of
nature
true
the
baron
says
their
politicians
are
precious
sharp
chaps
added
french
oh
there
are
politicians
in
bulgaria
are
there
asked
the
senator
whose
ideas
of
the
roumanian
and
bulgarian
neighbourhood
were
vague
and
who
had
a
general
notion
that
all
such
people
lived
in
tents
wore
sheepskins
with
the
wool
inside
and
ate
curds
oh
they
have
politicians
there
i
would
like
to
see
them
try
their
sharpness
in
the
really
said
lee
think
of
attila
and
his
hordes
running
an
indiana
caucus
anyhow
cried
french
with
a
loud
laugh
the
baron
said
that
a
set
of
bigger
political
scoundrels
than
his
friends
could
be
found
in
all
did
he
say
that
exclaimed
ratcliffe
angrily
did
he
lee
but
i
do
believe
it
do
you
what
your
candid
opinion
ratcliffe
what
you
do
know
about
illinois
politics
worth
knowing
do
you
really
think
those
bulgrascals
could
run
an
illinois
state
convention
ratcliffe
did
not
like
to
be
chaffed
especially
on
this
subject
but
he
could
not
resent
french
liberty
which
was
only
a
moderate
return
for
the
wooden
nutmeg
to
get
the
conversation
away
from
europe
from
literature
from
art
was
his
great
object
and
chaff
was
a
way
of
escape
carrington
was
very
well
aware
that
the
weak
side
of
the
senator
lay
in
his
blind
ignorance
of
morals
he
flattered
himself
that
lee
must
see
this
and
be
shocked
by
it
sooner
or
later
so
that
nothing
more
was
necessary
than
to
let
ratcliffe
expose
himself
without
talking
very
much
carrington
always
aimed
at
drawing
him
out
he
soon
found
however
that
ratcliffe
understood
such
tactics
perfectly
and
instead
of
injuring
he
rather
improved
his
position
at
times
the
audacity
was
startling
and
even
when
carrington
thought
him
hopelessly
entangled
he
would
sweep
away
all
the
hunter
nets
with
a
sheer
effort
of
strength
and
walk
off
bolder
and
more
dangerous
than
ever
when
lee
pressed
him
too
closely
he
frankly
admitted
her
charges
what
you
say
is
in
great
part
true
there
is
much
in
politics
that
disgusts
and
disheartens
much
that
is
coarse
and
bad
i
grant
you
there
is
dishonesty
and
corruption
we
must
try
to
make
the
amount
as
small
as
you
should
be
able
to
tell
lee
how
she
must
go
to
work
said
carrington
you
have
had
experience
i
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
once
driven
to
very
hard
measures
against
ratcliffe
looked
at
this
compliment
and
gave
carrington
one
of
his
cold
glances
that
meant
mischief
but
he
took
up
the
challenge
on
the
spot
yes
i
was
and
am
very
sorry
for
it
the
story
is
this
lee
and
it
is
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
state
of
illinois
so
that
i
have
no
reason
for
softening
it
in
the
worst
days
of
the
war
there
was
almost
a
certainty
that
my
state
would
be
carried
by
the
peace
party
by
fraud
as
we
thought
although
fraud
or
not
we
were
bound
to
save
it
had
illinois
been
lost
then
we
should
certainly
have
lost
the
presidential
election
and
with
it
probably
the
union
at
any
rate
i
believed
the
fate
of
the
war
to
depend
on
the
result
i
was
then
governor
and
upon
me
the
responsibility
rested
we
had
entire
control
of
the
northern
counties
and
of
their
returns
we
ordered
the
returning
officers
in
a
certain
number
of
counties
to
make
no
returns
until
they
heard
from
us
and
when
we
had
received
the
votes
of
all
the
southern
counties
and
learned
the
precise
number
of
votes
we
needed
to
give
us
a
majority
we
telegraphed
to
our
northern
returning
officers
to
make
the
vote
of
their
districts
such
and
such
thereby
overbalancing
the
adverse
returns
and
giving
the
state
to
us
this
was
done
and
as
i
am
now
senator
i
have
a
right
to
suppose
that
what
i
did
was
approved
i
am
not
proud
of
the
transaction
but
i
would
do
it
again
and
worse
than
that
if
i
thought
it
would
save
this
country
from
disunion
but
of
course
i
did
not
expect
carrington
to
approve
it
i
believe
he
was
then
carrying
out
his
reform
principles
by
bearing
arms
against
the
yes
said
carrington
drily
you
got
the
better
of
me
too
like
the
old
scotchman
you
did
care
who
made
the
people
wars
provided
you
made
its
carrington
had
missed
his
point
the
man
who
has
committed
a
murder
for
his
country
is
a
patriot
and
not
an
assassin
even
when
he
receives
a
seat
in
the
senate
as
his
share
of
the
plunder
women
can
not
be
expected
to
go
behind
the
motives
of
that
patriot
who
saves
his
country
and
his
election
in
times
of
revolution
carrington
hostility
to
ratcliffe
was
however
mild
when
compared
with
that
felt
by
old
baron
jacobi
why
the
baron
should
have
taken
so
violent
a
prejudice
it
is
not
easy
to
explain
but
a
diplomatist
and
a
senator
are
natural
enemies
and
jacobi
as
an
avowed
admirer
of
lee
found
ratcliffe
in
his
way
this
prejudiced
and
immoral
old
diplomatist
despised
and
loathed
an
american
senator
as
the
type
which
to
his
bleared
european
eyes
combined
the
utmost
pragmatical
and
overbearing
temper
with
the
narrowest
education
and
the
meanest
personal
experience
that
ever
existed
in
any
considerable
government
as
baron
jacobi
country
had
no
special
relations
with
that
of
the
united
states
and
its
legation
at
washington
was
a
mere
job
to
create
a
place
for
jacobi
to
fill
he
had
no
occasion
to
disguise
his
personal
antipathies
and
he
considered
himself
in
some
degree
as
having
a
mission
to
express
that
diplomatic
contempt
for
the
senate
which
his
colleagues
if
they
felt
it
were
obliged
to
conceal
he
performed
his
duties
with
conscientious
precision
he
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
thrust
the
sharp
point
of
his
dialectic
rapier
through
the
joints
of
the
clumsy
and
senatorial
he
delighted
in
skilfully
exposing
to
madeleine
eyes
some
new
side
of
ratcliffe
ignorance
his
conversation
at
such
times
sparkled
with
historical
allusions
quotations
in
half
a
dozen
different
languages
references
to
facts
which
an
old
man
memory
could
not
recall
with
precision
in
all
their
details
but
with
which
the
honourable
senator
was
familiarly
acquainted
and
which
he
could
readily
supply
and
his
voltairian
face
leered
politely
as
he
listened
to
ratcliffe
reply
which
showed
invariable
ignorance
of
common
literature
art
and
history
the
climax
of
his
triumph
came
one
evening
when
ratcliffe
unluckily
tempted
by
some
allusion
to
molière
which
he
thought
he
understood
made
reference
to
the
unfortunate
influence
of
that
great
man
on
the
religious
opinions
of
his
time
jacobi
by
a
flash
of
inspiration
divined
that
he
had
confused
molière
with
voltaire
and
assuming
a
manner
of
extreme
suavity
he
put
his
victim
on
the
rack
and
tortured
him
with
affected
explanations
and
interrogations
until
madeleine
was
in
a
manner
forced
to
interrupt
and
end
the
scene
but
even
when
the
senator
was
not
to
be
lured
into
a
trap
he
could
not
escape
assault
the
baron
in
such
a
case
would
cross
the
lines
and
attack
him
on
his
own
ground
as
on
one
occasion
when
ratcliffe
was
defending
his
doctrine
of
party
allegiance
jacobi
silenced
him
by
sneering
somewhat
thus
your
principle
is
quite
correct
mr
senator
i
too
like
yourself
was
once
a
good
party
man
my
party
was
that
of
the
church
i
was
ultramontane
your
party
system
is
one
of
your
thefts
from
our
church
your
national
convention
is
our
oecumenic
council
you
abdicate
reason
as
we
do
before
its
decisions
and
you
yourself
ratcliffe
you
are
a
cardinal
they
are
able
men
those
cardinals
i
have
known
many
they
were
our
best
friends
but
they
were
not
reformers
are
you
a
reformer
mr
senator
ratcliffe
grew
to
dread
and
hate
the
old
man
but
all
his
ordinary
tactics
were
powerless
against
this
impenetrable
eighteenth
century
cynic
if
he
resorted
to
his
congressional
practise
of
browbeating
and
dogmatism
the
baron
only
smiled
and
turned
his
back
or
made
some
remark
in
french
which
galled
his
enemy
all
the
more
because
while
he
did
not
understand
it
he
knew
well
that
madeleine
did
and
that
she
tried
to
repress
her
smile
ratcliffe
grey
eyes
grew
colder
and
stonier
than
ever
as
he
gradually
perceived
that
baron
jacobi
was
carrying
on
a
set
scheme
with
malignant
ingenuity
to
drive
him
out
of
madeleine
house
and
he
swore
a
terrible
oath
that
he
would
not
be
beaten
by
that
foreigner
on
the
other
hand
jacobi
had
little
hope
of
success
what
can
an
old
man
do
said
he
with
perfect
sincerity
to
carrington
if
i
were
forty
years
younger
that
great
oaf
should
not
have
his
own
way
ah
i
wish
i
were
young
again
and
we
were
in
vienna
from
which
it
was
rightly
inferred
by
carrington
that
the
venerable
diplomatist
would
if
such
acts
were
still
in
fashion
have
coolly
insulted
the
senator
and
put
a
bullet
through
his
heart
chapter
vi
in
february
the
weather
became
warmer
and
in
virginia
there
comes
often
at
this
season
a
deceptive
gleam
of
summer
slipping
in
between
heavy
of
sleet
and
snow
days
and
sometimes
weeks
when
the
temperature
is
like
june
when
the
earliest
plants
begin
to
show
their
hardy
flowers
and
when
the
bare
branches
of
the
forest
trees
alone
protest
against
the
conduct
of
the
seasons
then
men
and
women
are
languid
life
seems
as
in
italy
sensuous
and
glowing
with
colour
one
is
conscious
of
walking
in
an
atmosphere
that
is
warm
palpable
radiant
with
possibilities
a
delicate
haze
hangs
over
arlington
and
softens
even
the
harsh
white
glare
of
the
capitol
the
struggle
of
existence
seems
to
abate
lent
throws
its
calm
shadow
over
society
and
youthful
diplomatists
unconscious
of
their
danger
are
lured
into
asking
foolish
girls
to
marry
them
the
blood
thaws
in
the
heart
and
flows
out
into
the
veins
like
the
rills
of
sparkling
water
that
trickle
from
every
lump
of
ice
or
snow
as
though
all
the
ice
and
snow
on
earth
and
all
the
hardness
of
heart
all
the
heresy
and
schism
all
the
works
of
the
devil
had
yielded
to
the
force
of
love
and
to
the
fresh
warmth
of
innocent
confiding
virtue
in
such
a
world
there
should
be
no
guile
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
it
notwithstanding
indeed
at
no
other
season
is
there
so
much
this
is
the
moment
when
the
two
whited
sepulchres
at
either
end
of
the
avenue
reek
with
the
thick
atmosphere
of
bargain
and
sale
the
old

is
coming
wealth
office
power
are
at
auction
who
bids

with
most
venom
who

with
most
skill
who
has
done
the
dirtiest
the
meanest
the
darkest
and
the
most
political
work
he
shall
have
his
reward
senator
ratcliffe
was
absorbed
and
ill
at
ease
a
swarm
of
applicants
for
office
dogged
his
steps
and
beleaguered
his
rooms
in
quest
of
his
endorsement
of
their
paper
characters
the
new
president
was
to
arrive
on
monday
intrigues
and
combinations
of
which
the
senator
was
the
soul
were
all
alive
awaiting
this
arrival
newspaper
correspondents
pestered
him
with
questions
brother
senators
called
him
to
conferences
his
mind
was
with
his
own
interests
one
might
have
supposed
that
at
this
instant
nothing
could
have
drawn
him
away
from
the
political
and
yet
when
lee
remarked
that
she
was
going
to
mount
vernon
on
saturday
with
a
little
party
including
the
british
minister
and
an
irish
gentleman
staying
as
a
guest
at
the
british
legation
the
senator
surprised
her
by
expressing
a
strong
wish
to
join
them
he
explained
that
as
the
political
lead
was
no
longer
in
his
hands
the
chances
were
nine
in
ten
that
if
he
stirred
at
all
he
should
make
a
blunder
that
his
friends
expected
him
to
do
something
when
in
fact
nothing
could
be
done
that
every
preparation
had
already
been
made
and
that
for
him
to
go
on
an
excursion
to
mount
vernon
at
this
moment
with
the
british
minister
was
on
the
whole
about
the
best
use
he
could
make
of
his
time
since
it
would
hide
him
for
one
day
at
least
lord
skye
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
consulting
lee
when
his
own
social
resources
were
low
and
it
was
she
who
had
suggested
this
party
to
mount
vernon
with
carrington
for
a
guide
and
gore
for
variety
to
occupy
the
time
of
the
irish
friend
whom
lord
skye
was
bravely
entertaining
this
gentleman
who
bore
the
title
of
dunbeg
was
a
dilapidated
peer
neither
wealthy
nor
famous
lord
skye
brought
him
to
call
on
lee
and
in
some
sort
put
him
under
her
care
he
was
young
not
quite
intelligent
rather
too
fond
of
facts
and
not
quick
at
humour
he
was
given
to
smiling
in
a
deprecatory
way
and
when
he
talked
he
was
either
absent
or
excited
he
made
vague
blunders
and
then
smiled
in
deprecation
of
offence
or
his
words
blocked
their
own
path
in
their
rush
perhaps
his
manner
was
a
little
ridiculous
but
he
had
a
good
heart
a
good
head
and
a
title
he
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
sybil
and
victoria
dare
who
declined
to
admit
other
women
to
the
party
although
they
offered
no
objection
to
ratcliffe
admission
as
for
lord
dunbeg
he
was
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
general
washington
and
as
he
privately
intimated
eager
to
study
phases
of
american
society
he
was
delighted
to
go
with
a
small
party
and
miss
dare
secretly
promised
herself
that
she
would
show
him
a
phase
the
morning
was
warm
the
sky
soft
the
little
steamer
lay
at
the
quiet
wharf
with
a
few
negroes
lazily
watching
her
preparations
for
departure
carrington
with
lee
and
the
young
ladies
arrived
first
and
stood
leaning
against
the
rail
waiting
the
arrival
of
their
companions
then
came
gore
neatly
attired
and
gloved
with
a
light
spring
overcoat
for
gore
was
very
careful
of
his
personal
appearance
and
not
a
little
vain
of
his
good
looks
then
a
pretty
woman
with
blue
eyes
and
blonde
hair
dressed
in
black
and
leading
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
came
on
board
and
carrington
went
to
shake
hands
with
her
on
his
return
to
side
she
asked
about
his
new
acquaintance
and
he
replied
with
a
as
though
he
were
not
proud
of
her
that
she
was
a
client
a
pretty
widow
well
known
in
washington
any
one
at
the
capitol
would
tell
you
all
about
her
she
was
the
wife
of
a
noted
lobbyist
who
died
about
two
years
ago
congressmen
can
refuse
nothing
to
a
pretty
face
and
she
was
their
idea
of
feminine
perfection
yet
she
is
a
silly
little
woman
too
her
husband
died
after
a
very
short
illness
and
to
my
great
surprise
made
me
executor
under
his
will
i
think
he
had
an
idea
that
he
could
trust
me
with
his
papers
which
were
important
and
compromising
for
he
seems
to
have
had
no
time
to
go
over
them
and
destroy
what
were
best
out
of
the
way
so
you
see
i
am
left
with
his
widow
and
child
to
look
after
luckily
they
are
well
provided
still
you
have
not
told
me
her
her
name
is
baker
sam
baker
but
they
are
casting
off
and
ratcliffe
will
be
left
behind
i
ask
the
captain
to
about
a
dozen
passengers
had
arrived
among
them
the
two
earls
with
a
footman
carrying
a
promising
and
the
planks
were
actually
hauled
in
when
a
carriage
dashed
up
to
the
wharf
and
ratcliffe
leaped
out
and
hurried
on
board
off
with
you
as
quick
as
you
can
said
he
to
the
and
in
another
moment
the
little
steamer
had
begun
her
journey
pounding
the
muddy
waters
of
the
potomac
and
sending
up
its
small
column
of
smoke
as
though
it
were
a
newly
invented
approaching
the
temple
of
the
national
deity
ratcliffe
explained
in
great
glee
how
he
had
barely
managed
to
escape
his
visitors
by
telling
them
that
the
british
minister
was
waiting
for
him
and
that
he
would
be
back
again
presently
if
they
had
known
where
i
was
going
said
he
you
would
have
seen
the
boat
swamped
with
illinois
alone
would
have
brought
you
to
a
watery
he
was
in
high
spirits
bent
upon
enjoying
his
holiday
and
as
they
passed
the
arsenal
with
its
solitary
sentry
and
the
with
its
one
unseaworthy
wooden
he
pointed
out
these
evidences
of
national
grandeur
to
lord
skye
threatening
as
the
last
terror
of
diplomacy
to
send
him
home
in
an
american
frigate
they
were
thus
indulging
in
senatorial
humour
on
one
side
of
the
boat
while
sybil
and
victoria
with
the
aid
of
gore
and
carrington
were
improving
lord
dunbeg
mind
on
the
other
miss
dare
finding
for
herself
at
last
a
convenient
seat
where
she
could
repose
and
be
mistress
of
the
situation
put
on
a
more
than
usually
demure
expression
and
waited
with
gravity
until
her
noble
neighbour
should
give
her
an
opportunity
to
show
those
powers
which
as
she
believed
would
supply
a
phase
in
his
existence
miss
dare
was
one
of
those
young
persons
sometimes
to
be
found
in
america
who
seem
to
have
no
object
in
life
and
while
apparently
devoted
to
men
care
nothing
about
them
but
find
happiness
only
in
violating
rules
she
made
no
parade
of
whatever
virtues
she
had
and
her
chief
pleasure
was
to
make
fun
of
all
the
world
and
herself
what
a
noble
river
remarked
lord
dunbeg
as
the
boat
passed
out
upon
the
wide
stream
i
suppose
you
often
sail
on
it
i
never
was
here
in
my
life
till
now
replied
the
untruthful
miss
dare
we
do
think
much
of
it
it
s
too
small
we
used
to
so
much
larger
i
am
afraid
you
would
not
like
our
english
rivers
then
they
are
mere
brooks
compared
with
are
they
indeed
said
victoria
with
an
appearance
of
vague
surprise
how
curious
i
do
think
i
care
to
be
an
englishwoman
then
i
could
not
live
without
big
lord
dunbeg
stared
and
hinted
that
this
was
almost
unreasonable
unless
i
were
a
countess
continued
victoria
meditatively
looking
at
alexandria
and
paying
no
attention
to
his
lordship
i
think
i
could
manage
if
i
were
a
it
is
such
a
pretty
title
duchess
is
commonly
thought
a
prettier
one
stammered
dunbeg
much
embarrassed
the
young
man
was
not
used
to
chaff
from
women
i
should
be
satisfied
with
countess
it
sounds
well
i
am
surprised
that
you
do
like
dunbeg
looked
about
him
uneasily
for
some
means
of
escape
but
he
was
barred
in
i
should
think
you
would
feel
an
awful
responsibility
in
selecting
a
countess
how
do
you
do
it
lord
dunbeg
nervously
joined
in
the
general
laughter
as
sybil
ejaculated
oh
victoria
but
miss
dare
continued
without
a
smile
or
any
elevation
of
her
monotonous
voice
now
sybil
do
interrupt
me
please
i
am
deeply
interested
in
lord
dunbeg
conversation
he
understands
that
my
interest
is
purely
scientific
but
my
happiness
requires
that
i
should
know
how
countesses
are
selected
lord
dunbeg
how
would
you
recommend
a
friend
to
choose
a
countess
lord
dunbeg
began
to
be
amused
by
her
impudence
and
he
even
tried
to
lay
down
for
her
satisfaction
one
or
two
rules
for
selecting
countesses
but
long
before
he
had
invented
his
first
rule
victoria
had
darted
off
to
a
new
subject
which
would
you
rather
be
lord
dunbeg
an
earl
or
george
washington
george
washington
certainly
was
the
earl
courteous
though
rather
bewildered
reply
really
she
asked
with
a
languid
affectation
of
surprise
it
is
awfully
kind
of
you
to
say
so
but
of
course
you
ca
mean
it
indeed
i
do
mean
is
it
possible
i
never
should
have
thought
why
not
miss
dare
you
have
not
the
air
of
wishing
to
be
george
may
i
again
ask
why
not
certainly
did
you
ever
see
george
washington
of
course
not
he
died
fifty
years
before
i
was
i
thought
so
you
see
you
do
know
him
now
will
you
give
us
an
idea
of
what
you
imagine
general
washington
to
have
looked
like
dunbeg
gave
accordingly
a
flattering
description
of
general
washington
compounded
of
stuart
portrait
and
greenough
statue
of
olympian
jove
with
washington
features
in
the
capitol
square
miss
dare
listened
with
an
expression
of
superiority
not
unmixed
with
patience
and
then
she
enlightened
him
as
follows
all
you
have
been
saying
is
perfect
stuff
excuse
the
vulgarity
of
the
expression
when
i
am
a
countess
i
will
correct
my
language
the
truth
is
that
general
washington
was
a
country
farmer
very
very
awkward
very
illiterate
and
very
dull
very
bad
tempered
very
profane
and
generally
tipsy
after
you
shock
me
miss
dare
exclaimed
dunbeg
oh
i
know
all
about
general
washington
my
grandfather
knew
him
intimately
and
often
stayed
at
mount
vernon
for
weeks
together
you
must
not
believe
what
you
read
and
not
a
word
of
what
carrington
will
say
he
is
a
virginian
and
will
tell
you
no
end
of
fine
stories
and
not
a
syllable
of
truth
in
one
of
them
we
are
all
patriotic
about
washington
and
like
to
hide
his
faults
if
i
were
quite
sure
you
would
never
repeat
it
i
would
not
tell
you
this
the
truth
is
that
even
when
george
washington
was
a
small
boy
his
temper
was
so
violent
that
no
one
could
do
anything
with
him
he
once
cut
down
all
his
in
a
fit
of
passion
and
then
just
because
they
wanted
to
flog
him
he
threatened
to
brain
his
father
with
the
hatchet
his
aged
wife
suffered
agonies
from
him
my
grandfather
often
told
me
how
he
had
seen
the
general
pinch
and
swear
at
her
till
the
poor
creature
left
the
room
in
tears
and
how
once
at
mount
vernon
he
saw
washington
when
quite
an
old
man
suddenly
rush
at
an
unoffending
visitor
and
chase
him
off
the
place
beating
him
all
the
time
over
the
head
with
a
great
stick
with
knots
in
it
and
all
just
because
he
heard
the
poor
man
stammer
he
never
could
abide
carrington
and
gore
burst
into
shouts
of
laughter
over
this
description
of
the
father
of
his
country
but
victoria
continued
in
her
gentle
drawl
to
enlighten
lord
dunbeg
in
regard
to
other
subjects
with
information
equally
mendacious
until
he
decided
that
she
was
quite
the
most
eccentric
person
he
had
ever
met
the
boat
arrived
at
mount
vernon
while
she
was
still
engaged
in
a
description
of
the
society
and
manners
of
america
and
especially
of
the
rules
which
made
an
offer
of
marriage
necessary
according
to
her
lord
dunbeg
was
in
imminent
peril
gentlemen
and
especially
foreigners
were
expected
in
all
the
states
south
of
the
potomac
to
offer
themselves
to
at
least
one
young
lady
in
every
city
and
i
had
only
yesterday
said
victoria
a
letter
from
a
lovely
girl
in
north
carolina
a
dear
friend
of
mine
who
wrote
me
that
she
was
right
put
out
because
her
brothers
had
called
on
a
young
english
visitor
with
shot
guns
and
she
was
afraid
he
would
recover
and
after
all
she
says
she
should
have
refused
meanwhile
madeleine
on
the
other
side
of
the
boat
undisturbed
by
the
laughter
that
surrounded
miss
dare
chatted
soberly
and
seriously
with
lord
skye
and
senator
ratcliffe
lord
skye
too
a
little
intoxicated
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
morning
broke
out
into
admiration
of
the
noble
river
and
accused
americans
of
not
appreciating
the
beauties
of
their
own
country
your
national
mind
said
he
has
no
eyelids
it
requires
a
broad
glare
and
a
beaten
road
it
prefers
shadows
which
you
can
cut
out
with
a
knife
it
does
know
the
beauty
of
this
virginia
winter
lee
resented
the
charge
america
she
maintained
had
not
worn
her
feelings
threadbare
like
europe
she
had
still
her
story
to
tell
she
was
waiting
for
her
burns
and
scott
her
wordsworth
and
byron
her
hogarth
and
turner
you
want
peaches
in
spring
said
she
give
us
our
thousand
years
of
summer
and
then
complain
if
you
please
that
our
peach
is
not
as
mellow
as
yours
even
our
voices
may
be
soft
then
she
added
with
a
significant
look
at
lord
skye
we
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
arguing
with
lee
said
he
to
ratcliffe
when
she
ends
as
counsel
she
begins
as
witness
the
famous
duchess
of
devonshire
lips
were
not
half
as
convincing
as
ratcliffe
listened
carefully
assenting
whenever
he
saw
that
lee
wished
it
he
wished
he
understood
precisely
what
tones
and
colours
and
harmonies
were
they
arrived
and
strolled
up
the
sunny
path
at
the
tomb
they
halted
as
all
good
americans
do
and
gore
in
a
tone
of
subdued
sorrow
delivered
a
short
address
it
might
be
much
worse
if
they
improved
it
he
said
surveying
its
proportions
with
the
æsthetic
eye
of
a
cultured
bostonian
as
it
stands
this
tomb
is
a
simple
misfortune
which
might
befall
any
of
us
we
should
not
grieve
over
it
too
much
what
would
our
feelings
be
if
a
congressional
committee
reconstructed
it
of
white
marble
with
gothic
and
gilded
it
inside
on
stucco
madeleine
however
insisted
that
the
tomb
as
it
stood
was
the
only
restless
spot
about
the
quiet
landscape
and
that
it
contradicted
all
her
ideas
about
repose
in
the
grave
ratcliffe
wondered
what
she
meant
they
passed
on
wandering
across
the
lawn
and
through
the
house
their
eyes
weary
of
the
harsh
colours
and
forms
of
the
city
took
pleasure
in
the
worn
wainscots
and
the
stained
walls
some
of
the
rooms
were
still
occupied
fires
were
burning
in
the
wide
all
were
tolerably
furnished
and
there
was
no
uncomfortable
sense
of
repair
or
newness
they
mounted
the
stairs
and
lee
fairly
laughed
when
she
was
shown
the
room
in
which
general
washington
slept
and
where
he
died
carrington
smiled
too
our
old
virginia
houses
were
mostly
like
this
said
he
suites
of
great
halls
below
and
these
gaunt
barracks
above
the
virginia
house
was
a
sort
of
hotel
when
there
was
a
race
or
a
wedding
or
a
dance
and
the
house
was
full
they
thought
nothing
of
packing
half
a
dozen
people
in
one
room
and
if
the
room
was
large
they
stretched
a
sheet
a
cross
to
separate
the
men
from
the
women
as
for
toilet
those
were
not
the
mornings
of
cold
baths
with
our
ancestors
a
little
washing
went
a
long
do
you
still
live
so
in
virginia
asked
madeleine
oh
no
it
is
quite
gone
we
live
now
like
other
country
people
and
try
to
pay
our
debts
which
that
generation
never
did
they
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
they
kept
a
of
horses
the
young
men
were
always
riding
about
the
country
betting
on
gambling
drinking
fighting
and
making
love
no
one
knew
exactly
what
he
was
worth
until
the
crash
came
about
fifty
years
ago
and
the
whole
thing
ran
just
what
happened
in
ireland
said
lord
dunbeg
much
interested
and
full
of
his
article
in
the
quarterly
the
resemblance
is
perfect
even
down
to
the
lee
asked
carrington
bluntly
whether
he
regretted
the
destruction
of
this
old
social
arrangement
one
ca
help
regretting
said
he
whatever
it
was
that
produced
george
washington
and
a
crowd
of
other
men
like
him
but
i
think
we
might
produce
the
men
still
if
we
had
the
same
field
for
and
would
you
bring
the
old
society
back
again
if
you
could
asked
she
what
for
it
could
not
hold
itself
up
general
washington
himself
could
not
save
it
before
he
died
he
had
lost
his
hold
on
virginia
and
his
power
was
the
party
for
a
while
separated
and
lee
found
herself
alone
in
the
great
presently
the
blonde
baker
entered
with
her
child
who
ran
about
making
more
noise
than
washington
would
have
permitted
madeleine
who
had
the
usual
feminine
love
of
children
called
the
girl
to
her
and
pointed
out
the
shepherds
and
shepherdesses
carved
on
the
white
italian
marble
of
the
fireplace
she
invented
a
little
story
about
them
to
amuse
the
child
while
the
mother
stood
by
and
at
the
end
thanked
the
with
more
enthusiasm
than
seemed
called
for
lee
did
not
fancy
her
effusive
manner
or
her
complexion
and
was
glad
when
dunbeg
appeared
at
the
doorway
how
do
you
like
general
washington
at
home
asked
she
really
i
assure
you
i
feel
quite
at
home
myself
replied
dunbeg
with
a
more
beaming
smile
than
ever
i
am
sure
general
washington
was
an
irishman
i
know
it
from
the
look
of
the
place
i
mean
to
look
it
up
and
write
an
article
about
then
if
you
have
disposed
of
him
said
madeleine
i
think
we
will
have
luncheon
and
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
order
it
to
be
served
there
a
table
had
been
improvised
and
miss
dare
was
inspecting
the
lunch
and
making
comments
upon
lord
skye
cuisine
and
cellar
i
hope
it
is
very
dry
champagne
said
she
the
taste
for
sweet
champagne
is
quite
awfully
the
young
woman
knew
no
more
about
dry
and
sweet
champagne
than
of
the
wine
of
ulysses
except
that
she
drank
both
with
equal
satisfaction
but
she
was
mimicking
a
secretary
of
the
british
legation
who
had
provided
her
with
supper
at
her
last
evening
party
lord
skye
begged
her
to
try
it
which
she
did
and
with
great
gravity
remarked
that
it
was
about
five
per
cent
she
presumed
this
too
was
caught
from
her
secretary
though
she
knew
no
more
what
it
meant
than
if
she
had
been
a
parrot
the
luncheon
was
very
lively
and
very
good
when
it
was
over
the
gentlemen
were
allowed
to
smoke
and
conversation
fell
into
a
sober
strain
which
at
last
threatened
to
become
serious
you
want
said
madeleine
to
lord
skye
are
there
not
enough
to
suit
you
on
the
walls
of
this
house
lord
skye
suggested
that
this
was
probably
owing
to
the
fact
that
washington
belonging
as
he
did
to
the
universe
was
in
his
taste
an
exception
to
local
rules
is
not
the
sense
of
rest
here
captivating
she
continued
look
at
that
quaint
garden
and
this
ragged
lawn
and
the
great
river
in
front
and
the
superannuated
fort
beyond
the
river
everything
is
peaceful
even
down
to
the
poor
old
general
little
one
would
like
to
lie
down
in
it
and
sleep
a
century
or
two
and
yet
that
dreadful
capitol
and
its
are
only
ten
miles
no
that
is
more
than
i
can
bear
broke
in
miss
victoria
in
a
stage
whisper
that
dreadful
capitol
why
not
one
of
us
would
be
here
without
that
dreadful
capitol
except
perhaps
you
would
appear
very
well
as
washington
miss
dare
has
been
so
very
obliging
as
to
give
us
her
views
of
general
washington
character
this
morning
said
dunbeg
but
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
ask
carrington
for
whatever
miss
dare
says
is
valuable
replied
carrington
but
her
strong
point
is
never
flatter
carrington
drawled
miss
dare
i
do
not
need
it
and
it
does
not
become
your
style
tell
me
lord
dunbeg
is
not
carrington
a
little
your
idea
of
general
washington
restored
to
us
in
his
prime
after
your
account
of
general
washington
miss
dare
how
can
i
agree
with
you
after
all
said
lord
skye
i
think
we
must
agree
that
miss
dare
is
in
the
main
right
about
the
charms
of
mount
vernon
even
lee
on
the
way
up
agreed
that
the
general
who
is
the
only
permanent
resident
here
has
the
air
of
being
confoundedly
bored
in
his
tomb
i
myself
love
your
dreadful
capitol
yonder
but
i
prefer
it
to
a
bucolic
life
here
and
i
account
in
this
way
for
my
want
of
enthusiasm
for
your
great
general
he
liked
no
kind
of
life
but
this
he
seems
to
have
been
greater
in
the
character
of
a
virginia
planter
than
as
general
or
president
i
forgive
him
his
inordinate
dulness
for
he
was
not
a
diplomatist
and
it
was
not
his
business
to
lie
but
he
might
once
in
a
way
have
forgotten
mount
dunbeg
here
burst
in
with
an
excited
protest
all
his
words
seemed
to
shove
each
other
aside
in
their
haste
to
escape
first
all
our
greatest
englishmen
have
been
country
squires
i
am
a
country
squire
how
interesting
said
miss
dare
under
her
breath
gore
here
joined
in
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
gentlemen
to
measure
general
washington
according
to
your
own
private
carpenter
rule
but
what
will
you
say
to
us
new
englanders
who
never
were
country
gentlemen
at
all
and
never
had
any
liking
for
virginia
what
did
washington
ever
do
for
us
he
never
even
pretended
to
like
us
he
never
was
more
than
barely
civil
to
us
i
not
finding
fault
with
him
everybody
knows
that
he
never
cared
for
anything
but
mount
vernon
for
all
that
we
idolize
him
to
us
he
is
morality
justice
duty
truth
half
a
dozen
roman
gods
with
capital
letters
he
is
austere
solitary
grand
he
ought
to
be
deified
i
hardly
feel
easy
eating
drinking
smoking
here
on
his
portico
without
his
permission
taking
liberties
with
his
house
criticising
his
bedrooms
in
his
absence
suppose
i
heard
his
horse
now
trotting
up
on
the
other
side
and
he
suddenly
appeared
at
this
door
and
looked
at
us
i
should
abandon
you
to
his
indignation
i
should
run
away
and
hide
myself
on
the
steamer
the
mere
thought
unmans
ratcliffe
seemed
amused
at
gore
notions
you
recall
to
me
said
he
my
own
feelings
when
i
was
a
boy
and
was
made
by
my
father
to
learn
the
farewell
address
by
heart
in
those
days
general
washington
was
a
sort
of
american
jehovah
but
the
west
is
a
poor
school
for
reverence
since
coming
to
congress
i
have
learned
more
about
general
washington
and
have
been
surprised
to
find
what
a
narrow
base
his
reputation
rests
on
a
fair
military
officer
who
made
many
blunders
and
who
never
had
more
men
than
would
make
a
full
under
his
command
he
got
an
enormous
reputation
in
europe
because
he
did
not
make
himself
king
as
though
he
ever
had
a
chance
of
doing
it
a
respectable
painstaking
president
he
was
treated
by
the
opposition
with
an
amount
of
deference
that
would
have
made
government
easy
to
a
baby
but
it
worried
him
to
death
his
official
papers
are
fairly
done
and
contain
good
average
sense
such
as
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
united
states
would
now
write
i
suspect
that
half
of
his
attachment
to
this
spot
rose
from
his
consciousness
of
inferior
powers
and
his
dread
of
responsibility
this
government
can
show
a
dozen
men
of
equal
abilities
but
we
do
deify
them
what
i
most
wonder
at
in
him
is
not
his
military
or
political
genius
at
all
for
i
doubt
whether
he
had
much
but
a
curious
yankee
shrewdness
in
money
matters
he
thought
himself
a
very
rich
man
yet
he
never
spent
a
dollar
foolishly
he
was
almost
the
only
virginian
i
ever
heard
of
in
public
life
who
did
not
die
during
this
long
speech
carrington
glanced
across
at
madeleine
and
caught
her
eye
ratcliffe
criticism
was
not
to
her
taste
carrington
could
see
that
she
thought
it
unworthy
of
him
and
he
knew
that
it
would
irritate
her
i
will
lay
a
little
trap
for
ratcliffe
thought
he
to
himself
we
will
see
whether
he
gets
out
of
so
carrington
began
and
all
listened
closely
for
as
a
virginian
he
was
supposed
to
know
much
about
the
subject
and
his
family
had
been
deep
in
the
confidence
of
washington
himself
the
neighbours
hereabout
had
for
many
years
and
may
have
still
some
curious
stories
about
general
washington
closeness
in
money
matters
they
said
he
never
bought
anything
by
weight
but
he
had
it
weighed
over
again
nor
by
tale
but
he
had
it
counted
and
if
the
weight
or
number
were
not
exact
he
sent
it
back
once
during
his
absence
his
steward
had
a
room
plastered
and
paid
the
plasterer
bill
on
the
return
he
measured
the
room
and
found
that
the
plasterer
had
charged
fifteen
shillings
too
much
meanwhile
the
man
had
died
and
the
general
made
a
claim
of
fifteen
shillings
on
his
estate
which
was
paid
again
one
of
his
tenants
brought
him
the
rent
the
exact
change
of
fourpence
was
required
the
man
tendered
a
dollar
and
asked
the
general
to
credit
him
with
the
balance
against
the
next
year
rent
the
general
refused
and
made
him
ride
nine
miles
to
alexandria
and
back
for
the
fourpence
on
the
other
hand
he
sent
to
a
shoemaker
in
alexandria
to
come
and
measure
him
for
shoes
the
man
returned
word
that
he
did
not
go
to
any
one
house
to
take
measures
and
the
general
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
the
nine
miles
to
him
one
of
his
rules
was
to
pay
at
taverns
the
same
sum
for
his
servants
meals
as
for
his
own
an
brought
him
a
bill
of
for
his
own
breakfast
and
three
shillings
for
his
servant
he
insisted
upon
adding
the
extra
ninepence
as
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
servant
had
eaten
as
much
as
he
what
do
you
say
to
these
anecdotes
was
this
meanness
or
not
ratcliffe
was
amused
the
stories
are
new
to
me
he
said
it
is
just
as
i
thought
these
are
signs
of
a
man
who
thinks
much
of
trifles
one
who
fusses
over
small
matters
we
do
do
things
in
that
way
now
that
we
no
longer
have
to
get
crops
from
granite
as
they
used
to
do
in
new
hampshire
when
i
was
a
carrington
replied
that
it
was
unlucky
for
virginians
that
they
had
not
done
things
in
that
way
then
if
they
had
they
would
not
have
gone
to
the
dogs
gore
shook
his
head
seriously
did
i
not
tell
you
so
said
he
was
not
this
man
an
abstract
virtue
i
give
you
my
word
i
stand
in
awe
before
him
and
i
feel
ashamed
to
pry
into
these
details
of
his
life
what
is
it
to
us
how
he
thought
proper
to
apply
his
principles
to
nightcaps
and
feather
dusters
we
are
not
his
body
servants
and
we
care
nothing
about
his
infirmities
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
that
he
carried
his
rules
of
virtue
down
to
a
pin
point
and
that
we
ought
one
and
all
to
be
on
our
knees
before
his
dunbeg
pondering
deeply
at
length
asked
carrington
whether
all
this
did
not
make
rather
a
clumsy
politician
of
the
father
of
his
country
mr
ratcliffe
knows
more
about
politics
than
i
ask
him
said
carrington
washington
was
no
politician
at
all
as
we
understand
the
word
replied
ratcliffe
abruptly
he
stood
outside
of
politics
the
thing
could
be
done
the
people
do
like
that
sort
of
royal
i
do
understand
said
lee
why
could
you
not
do
it
now
because
i
should
make
a
fool
of
myself
replied
ratcliffe
pleased
to
think
that
lee
should
put
him
on
a
level
with
washington
she
had
only
meant
to
ask
why
the
thing
could
not
be
done
and
this
little
touch
of
ratcliffe
vanity
was
inimitable
mr
ratcliffe
means
that
washington
was
too
respectable
for
our
time
interposed
carrington
this
was
deliberately
meant
to
irritate
ratcliffe
and
it
did
so
all
the
more
because
lee
turned
to
carrington
and
said
with
some
bitterness
was
he
then
the
only
honest
public
man
we
ever
had
oh
no
replied
carrington
cheerfully
there
have
been
one
or
two
if
the
rest
of
our
presidents
had
been
like
him
said
gore
we
should
have
had
fewer
ugly
blots
on
our
short
ratcliffe
was
exasperated
at
carrington
habit
of
drawing
discussion
to
this
point
he
felt
the
remark
as
a
personal
insult
and
he
knew
it
to
be
intended
public
men
he
broke
out
can
not
be
dressing
themselves
in
washington
old
clothes
if
washington
were
president
now
he
would
have
to
learn
our
ways
or
lose
his
next
election
only
fools
and
theorists
imagine
that
our
society
can
be
handled
with
gloves
or
long
poles
one
must
make
one
self
a
part
of
it
if
virtue
wo
answer
our
purpose
we
must
use
vice
or
our
opponents
will
put
us
out
of
office
and
this
was
as
true
in
washington
day
as
it
is
now
and
always
will
come
said
lord
skye
who
was
beginning
to
fear
an
open
quarrel
the
conversation
verges
on
treason
and
i
am
accredited
to
this
government
why
not
examine
the
grounds
a
kind
of
natural
sympathy
led
lord
dunbeg
to
wander
by
the
side
of
miss
dare
through
the
quaint
old
garden
his
mind
being
much
occupied
by
the
effort
of
stowing
away
the
impressions
he
had
just
received
he
was
more
than
usually
absent
in
his
manner
and
this
want
of
attention
irritated
the
young
lady
she
made
some
comments
on
flowers
she
invented
some
new
species
with
startling
names
she
asked
whether
these
were
known
in
ireland
but
lord
dunbeg
was
for
the
moment
so
vague
in
his
answers
that
she
saw
her
case
was
perilous
here
is
an
old
do
you
have
in
ireland
lord
dunbeg
yes
oh
certainly
what
oh
yes
i
assure
you
there
are
a
great
many
in
ireland
miss
i
am
so
glad
but
i
suppose
they
are
only
for
ornament
here
it
is
just
the
other
way
look
at
this
one
they
all
behave
like
that
the
wear
and
tear
of
our
sun
is
too
much
for
them
they
do
last
my
uncle
who
has
a
place
at
long
branch
had
five
in
ten
how
very
odd
but
really
now
miss
dare
i
do
see
how
a
sun
dial
could
wear
do
you
how
strange
do
you
see
they
get
soaked
with
sunshine
so
that
they
ca
hold
shadow
it
like
me
you
know
i
have
such
a
good
time
all
the
time
that
i
ca
be
unhappy
do
you
ever
read
the
burlington
hawkeye
lord
dunbeg
i
do
remember
i
think
not
is
it
an
american
serial
gasped
dunbeg
trying
hard
to
keep
pace
with
miss
dare
in
her
reckless
dashes
across
country
no
not
serial
at
all
replied
virginia
but
i
am
afraid
you
would
find
it
very
hard
reading
i
should
do
you
read
it
much
miss
dare
oh
always
i
am
not
really
as
light
as
i
seem
but
then
i
have
an
advantage
over
you
because
i
know
the
by
this
time
dunbeg
was
awake
again
and
miss
dare
satisfied
with
her
success
allowed
herself
to
become
more
reasonable
until
a
slight
shade
of
sentiment
began
to
flicker
about
their
path
the
scattered
party
however
soon
had
to
unite
again
the
boat
rang
its
bell
for
return
they
filed
down
the
paths
and
settled
themselves
in
their
old
places
as
they
steamed
away
lee
watched
the
sunny
and
the
peaceful
house
above
until
she
could
see
them
no
more
and
the
longer
she
looked
the
less
she
was
pleased
with
herself
was
it
true
as
victoria
dare
said
that
she
could
not
live
in
so
pure
an
air
did
she
really
need
the
denser
fumes
of
the
city
was
she
unknown
to
herself
gradually
becoming
tainted
with
the
life
about
her
or
was
ratcliffe
right
in
accepting
the
good
and
the
bad
together
and
in
being
of
his
time
since
he
was
in
it
why
was
it
she
said
bitterly
to
herself
that
everything
washington
touched
he
purified
even
down
to
the
associations
of
his
house
and
why
is
it
that
everything
we
touch
seems
soiled
why
do
i
feel
unclean
when
i
look
at
mount
vernon
in
spite
of
ratcliffe
is
it
not
better
to
be
a
child
and
to
cry
for
the
moon
and
stars
the
little
baker
girl
came
up
to
her
where
she
stood
and
began
playing
with
her
parasol
who
is
your
little
friend
asked
ratcliffe
lee
rather
vaguely
replied
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
that
pretty
woman
in
black
she
believed
her
name
was
baker
baker
did
you
say
repeated
ratcliffe
baker
sam
baker
at
least
so
carrington
told
me
he
said
she
was
a
client
of
in
fact
ratcliffe
soon
saw
carrington
go
up
to
her
and
remain
by
her
side
during
the
rest
of
the
trip
ratcliffe
watched
them
sharply
and
grew
more
and
more
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
as
the
boat
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
shore
carrington
was
in
high
spirits
he
thought
he
had
played
his
cards
with
unusual
success
even
miss
dare
deigned
to
acknowledge
his
charms
that
day
she
declared
herself
to
be
the
moral
image
of
martha
washington
and
she
started
a
discussion
whether
carrington
or
lord
dunbeg
would
best
suit
her
in
the
rôle
of
the
general
mr
carrington
is
exemplary
she
said
but
oh
what
joy
to
be
martha
washington
and
a
countess
too
chapter
vii
when
he
reached
his
rooms
that
afternoon
senator
ratcliffe
found
there
as
he
expected
a
choice
company
of
friends
and
admirers
who
had
beguiled
their
leisure
hours
since
noon
by
cursing
him
in
every
variety
of
profane
language
that
experience
could
suggest
and
impatience
stimulate
on
his
part
had
he
consulted
his
own
feelings
only
he
would
then
and
there
have
turned
them
out
and
locked
the
doors
behind
them
so
far
as
silent
maledictions
were
concerned
no
profanity
of
theirs
could
hold
its
own
against
the
intensity
and
deliberation
with
which
as
he
found
himself
approaching
his
own
door
he
expressed
between
his
teeth
his
views
in
respect
to
their
eternal
interests
nothing
could
be
less
suited
to
his
present
humour
than
the
society
which
awaited
him
in
his
rooms
he
groaned
in
spirit
as
he
sat
down
at
his
and
looked
about
him
dozens
of
were
besieging
the
house
men
whose
patriotic
services
in
the
last
election
called
loudly
for
recognition
from
a
grateful
country
they
brought
their
applications
to
the
senator
with
an
entreaty
that
he
would
endorse
and
take
charge
of
them
several
members
and
senators
who
felt
that
ratcliffe
had
no
reason
for
existence
except
to
fight
their
battle
for
patronage
were
lounging
about
his
room
reading
newspapers
or
beguiling
their
time
with
tobacco
in
various
forms
at
long
intervals
making
dull
remarks
as
though
they
were
more
weary
than
their
constituents
of
the
atmosphere
that
surrounds
the
grandest
government
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
several
newspaper
correspondents
eager
to
barter
their
news
for
ratcliffe
hints
or
suggestions
appeared
from
time
to
time
on
the
scene
and
dropping
into
a
chair
by
ratcliffe
desk
whispered
with
him
in
mysterious
tones
thus
the
senator
worked
on
hour
after
hour
mechanically
doing
what
was
required
of
him
signing
papers
without
reading
them
answering
remarks
without
hearing
them
hardly
looking
up
from
his
desk
and
appearing
immersed
in
labour
this
was
his
protection
against
curiosity
and
garrulity
the
pretence
of
work
was
the
curtain
he
drew
between
himself
and
the
world
behind
this
curtain
his
mental
operations
went
on
undisturbed
by
what
was
about
him
while
he
heard
all
that
was
said
and
said
little
or
nothing
himself
his
followers
respected
this
privacy
and
left
him
alone
he
was
their
prophet
and
had
a
right
to
seclusion
he
was
their
chieftain
and
while
he
sat
in
his
monosyllabic
solitude
his
ragged
tail
reclined
in
various
attitudes
about
him
and
occasionally
one
man
spoke
or
another
swore
newspapers
and
tobacco
were
their
resource
in
periods
of
absolute
silence
a
shade
of
depression
rested
on
the
faces
and
the
voices
of
clan
ratcliffe
that
evening
as
is
not
unusual
with
forces
on
the
eve
of
battle
their
remarks
came
at
longer
intervals
and
were
more
pointless
and
random
than
usual
there
was
a
want
of
elasticity
in
their
bearing
and
tone
partly
coming
from
sympathy
with
the
evident
depression
of
their
chief
partly
from
the
portents
of
the
time
the
president
was
to
arrive
within
hours
and
as
yet
there
was
no
sign
that
he
properly
appreciated
their
services
there
were
signs
only
too
unmistakeable
that
he
was
painfully
misled
and
deluded
that
his
countenance
was
turned
wholly
in
another
direction
and
that
all
their
sacrifices
were
counted
as
worthless
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
he
came
with
a
deliberate
purpose
of
making
war
upon
ratcliffe
and
breaking
him
down
of
refusing
to
bestow
patronage
on
them
and
of
bestowing
it
wherever
it
would
injure
them
most
deeply
at
the
thought
that
their
honestly
earned
harvest
of
foreign
missions
and
consulates
and
revenue
offices
postmasterships
indian
agencies
and
army
and
navy
contracts
might
now
be
wrung
from
their
grasp
by
the
selfish
greed
of
a
mere
accidental
intruder
a
man
whom
nobody
wanted
and
every
one
ridiculed
their
natures
rebelled
and
they
felt
that
such
things
must
not
be
that
there
could
be
no
more
hope
for
democratic
government
if
such
things
were
possible
at
this
point
they
invariably
became
excited
lost
their
equanimity
and
swore
then
they
fell
back
on
their
faith
in
ratcliffe
if
any
man
could
pull
them
through
he
could
after
all
the
president
must
first
reckon
with
him
and
he
was
an
uncommon
tough
customer
to
tackle
perhaps
however
even
their
faith
in
ratcliffe
might
have
been
shaken
could
they
at
that
moment
have
looked
into
his
mind
and
understood
what
was
passing
there
ratcliffe
was
a
man
vastly
their
superior
and
he
knew
it
he
lived
in
a
world
of
his
own
and
had
instincts
of
refinement
whenever
his
affairs
went
unfavourably
these
instincts
revived
and
for
the
time
swept
all
his
nature
with
them
he
was
now
filled
with
disgust
and
cynical
contempt
for
every
form
of
politics
during
long
years
he
had
done
his
best
for
his
party
he
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil
coined
his
heart
blood
toiled
with
a
dogged
persistence
that
no
ever
conceived
and
all
for
what
to
be
rejected
as
its
candidate
to
be
put
under
the
harrow
of
a
small
indiana
farmer
who
made
no
secret
of
the
intention
to
corral
him
and
as
he
elegantly
expressed
it
to
take
his
hide
and
ratcliffe
had
no
great
fear
of
losing
his
hide
but
he
felt
aggrieved
that
he
should
be
called
upon
to
defend
it
and
that
this
should
be
the
result
of
twenty
devotion
like
most
men
in
the
same
place
he
did
not
stop
to
cast
up
both
columns
of
his
account
with
the
party
nor
to
ask
himself
the
question
that
lay
at
the
heart
of
his
grievance
how
far
had
he
served
his
party
and
how
far
himself
he
was
in
no
humour
for
this
requires
more
repose
of
mind
than
he
could
then
command
as
for
the
president
from
whom
he
had
not
heard
a
whisper
since
the
insolent
letter
to
grimes
which
he
had
taken
care
not
to
show
the
senator
felt
only
a
strong
impulse
to
teach
him
better
sense
and
better
manners
but
as
for
political
life
the
events
of
the
last
six
months
were
calculated
to
make
any
man
doubt
its
value
he
was
quite
out
of
sympathy
with
it
he
hated
the
sight
of
his
satellites
with
their
hats
tipped
at
every
angle
except
the
right
one
and
their
feet
everywhere
except
on
the
floor
their
conversation
bored
him
and
their
presence
was
a
nuisance
he
would
not
submit
to
this
slavery
longer
he
would
have
given
his
senatorship
for
a
civilized
house
like
lee
with
a
woman
like
lee
at
its
head
and
twenty
thousand
a
year
for
life
he
smiled
his
only
smile
that
evening
when
he
thought
how
rapidly
she
would
rout
every
man
jack
of
his
political
following
out
of
her
parlours
and
how
meekly
they
would
submit
to
banishment
into
a
with
an
carpet
and
two
cane
chairs
he
felt
that
lee
was
more
necessary
to
him
than
the
presidency
itself
he
could
not
go
on
without
her
he
needed
human
companionship
some
christian
comfort
for
his
old
age
some
avenue
of
communication
with
that
social
world
which
made
his
present
surroundings
look
cold
and
foul
some
touch
of
that
refinement
of
mind
and
morals
beside
which
his
own
seemed
coarse
he
felt
unutterably
lonely
he
wished
lee
had
asked
him
home
to
dinner
but
lee
had
gone
to
bed
with
a
headache
he
should
not
see
her
again
for
a
week
then
his
mind
turned
back
upon
their
morning
at
mount
vernon
and
bethinking
himself
of
sam
baker
he
took
a
sheet
of
and
wrote
a
line
to
wilson
keen
at
georgetown
requesting
him
to
call
if
possible
the
next
morning
towards
one
at
the
senator
rooms
on
a
matter
of
business
wilson
keen
was
chief
of
the
secret
service
bureau
in
the
treasury
department
and
as
the
depositary
of
all
secrets
was
often
called
upon
for
assistance
which
he
was
very
in
furnishing
to
senators
especially
if
they
were
likely
to
be
secretaries
of
the
treasury
this
note
despatched
ratcliffe
fell
back
into
his
reflective
mood
which
led
him
apparently
into
still
lower
depths
of
discontent
until
with
a
muttered
oath
he
swore
he
could
stand
no
more
of
this
and
suddenly
rising
he
informed
his
visitors
that
he
was
sorry
to
leave
them
but
he
felt
rather
poorly
and
was
going
to
bed
and
to
bed
he
went
while
his
guests
departed
each
as
his
business
or
desires
might
point
him
some
to
drink
whiskey
and
some
to
repose
on
sunday
morning
ratcliffe
as
usual
went
to
church
he
always
attended
morning
service
at
the
methodist
episcopal
church
not
wholly
on
the
ground
of
religious
conviction
but
because
a
large
number
of
his
constituents
were
people
and
he
would
not
willingly
shock
their
principles
so
long
as
he
needed
their
votes
in
church
he
kept
his
eyes
closely
fixed
upon
the
clergyman
and
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
he
could
say
with
truth
that
he
had
not
heard
a
word
of
it
although
the
respectable
minister
was
gratified
by
the
attention
his
discourse
had
received
from
the
senator
from
illinois
an
attention
all
the
more
praiseworthy
because
of
the
engrossing
public
cares
which
must
at
that
moment
have
distracted
the
senator
mind
in
this
last
idea
the
minister
was
right
ratcliffe
mind
was
greatly
distracted
by
public
cares
and
one
of
his
strongest
reasons
for
going
to
church
at
all
was
that
he
might
get
an
hour
or
two
of
undisturbed
reflection
during
the
entire
service
he
was
absorbed
in
carrying
on
a
series
of
imaginary
conversations
with
the
new
president
he
brought
up
in
succession
every
form
of
proposition
which
the
president
might
make
to
him
every
trap
which
could
be
laid
for
him
every
sort
of
treatment
he
might
expect
so
that
he
could
not
be
taken
by
surprise
and
his
frank
simple
nature
could
never
be
at
a
loss
one
object
however
long
escaped
him
supposing
what
was
more
than
probable
that
the
president
opposition
to
ratcliffe
declared
friends
made
it
impossible
to
force
any
of
them
into
office
it
would
then
be
necessary
to
try
some
new
man
not
obnoxious
to
the
president
as
a
candidate
for
the
cabinet
who
should
this
be
ratcliffe
pondered
long
and
deeply
searching
out
a
man
who
combined
the
most
powerful
interests
with
the
fewest
enmities
this
subject
was
still
uppermost
at
the
moment
when
service
ended
ratcliffe
pondered
over
it
as
he
walked
back
to
his
rooms
not
until
he
reached
his
own
door
did
he
come
to
a
conclusion
carson
would
do
carson
of
pennsylvania
the
president
had
probably
never
heard
of
him
wilson
keen
was
waiting
the
senator
return
a
heavy
man
with
a
square
face
and
active
blue
eyes
a
man
of
few
words
and
those
the
interview
was
brief
after
apologising
for
breaking
in
upon
sunday
with
business
ratcliffe
excused
himself
on
the
ground
that
so
little
time
was
left
before
the
close
of
the
session
a
bill
now
before
one
of
his
committees
on
which
a
report
must
soon
be
made
involved
matters
to
which
it
was
believed
that
the
late
samuel
baker
formerly
a
in
washington
held
the
only
clue
he
being
dead
ratcliffe
wished
to
know
whether
he
had
left
any
papers
behind
him
and
in
whose
hands
these
papers
were
or
whether
any
partner
or
associate
of
his
was
acquainted
with
his
affairs
mr
keen
made
a
note
of
the
request
merely
remarking
that
he
had
been
very
well
acquainted
with
baker
and
also
a
little
with
his
wife
who
was
supposed
to
know
his
affairs
as
well
as
he
knew
them
himself
and
who
was
still
in
washington
he
thought
he
could
bring
the
information
in
a
day
or
two
as
he
then
rose
to
go
ratcliffe
added
that
entire
secrecy
was
necessary
as
the
interests
involved
in
obstructing
the
search
were
considerable
and
it
was
not
well
to
wake
them
up
mr
keen
assented
and
went
his
way
all
this
was
natural
enough
and
entirely
proper
at
least
so
far
as
appeared
on
the
surface
had
mr
keen
been
so
curious
in
other
affairs
as
to
look
for
the
particular
legislative
measure
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
ratcliffe
inquiries
he
might
have
searched
among
the
papers
of
congress
a
very
long
time
and
found
himself
greatly
puzzled
at
last
in
fact
there
was
no
measure
of
the
kind
the
whole
story
was
a
fiction
ratcliffe
had
scarcely
thought
of
baker
since
his
death
until
the
day
before
when
he
had
seen
his
widow
on
the
mount
vernon
steamer
and
had
found
her
in
relations
with
carrington
something
in
habitual
attitude
and
manner
towards
himself
had
long
struck
him
as
peculiar
and
this
connection
with
baker
had
suggested
to
the
senator
the
idea
that
it
might
be
well
to
have
an
eye
on
both
baker
was
a
silly
woman
as
he
knew
and
there
were
old
transactions
between
ratcliffe
and
baker
of
which
she
might
be
informed
but
which
ratcliffe
had
no
wish
to
see
brought
within
lee
ken
as
for
the
fiction
invented
to
set
keen
in
motion
it
was
an
innocent
one
it
harmed
nobody
ratcliffe
selected
this
particular
method
of
inquiry
because
it
was
the
easiest
safest
and
most
effectual
if
he
were
always
to
wait
until
he
could
afford
to
tell
the
precise
truth
business
would
very
soon
be
at
a
standstill
and
his
career
at
an
end
this
little
matter
disposed
of
the
senator
from
illinois
passed
his
afternoon
in
calling
upon
some
of
his
brother
senators
and
the
first
of
those
whom
he
honoured
with
a
visit
was
krebs
of
pennsylvania
there
were
many
reasons
which
now
made
the
of
that
statesman
essential
to
ratcliffe
the
strongest
of
them
was
that
the
pennsylvania
delegation
in
congress
was
well
disciplined
and
could
be
used
with
peculiar
advantage
for
purposes
of
ratcliffe
success
in
his
contest
with
the
new
president
depended
on
the
amount
of
pressure
he
could
employ
to
keep
himself
in
the
background
and
to
fling
over
the
head
of
the
raw
chief
magistrate
a
web
of
intertwined
influences
any
one
of
which
alone
would
be
useless
but
which
taken
together
were
not
to
be
broken
through
to
revive
the
lost
art
of
the
roman
retiarius
who
from
a
safe
distance
threw
his
net
over
his
adversary
before
attacking
with
the
dagger
this
was
intention
and
towards
this
he
had
been
directing
all
his
manipulation
for
weeks
past
how
much
bargaining
and
how
many
promises
he
found
it
necessary
to
make
was
known
to
himself
alone
about
this
time
lee
was
a
little
surprised
to
find
gore
speaking
with
entire
confidence
of
having
ratcliffe
support
in
his
application
for
the
spanish
mission
for
she
had
rather
imagined
that
gore
was
not
a
favourite
with
ratcliffe
she
noticed
too
that
schneidekoupon
had
come
back
again
and
spoke
mysteriously
of
interviews
with
ratcliffe
of
attempts
to
unite
the
interests
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
and
his
countenance
took
on
a
dark
and
dramatic
expression
as
he
proclaimed
that
no
sacrifice
of
the
principle
of
protection
should
be
tolerated
schneidekoupon
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
came
and
from
sybil
innocent
complaints
of
his
spirits
and
temper
lee
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
ratcliffe
clinton
and
krebs
had
for
the
moment
combined
to
sit
heavily
upon
poor
schneidekoupon
and
to
remove
his
disturbing
influence
from
the
scene
at
least
until
other
men
should
get
what
they
wanted
these
were
merely
the
trifling
incidents
that
fell
within
lee
observation
she
felt
an
atmosphere
of
bargain
and
intrigue
but
she
could
only
imagine
how
far
it
extended
even
carrington
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
it
only
laughed
and
shook
his
head
those
matters
are
private
my
dear
lee
you
and
i
are
not
meant
to
know
such
this
sunday
afternoon
ratcliffe
object
was
to
arrange
the
little
manoeuvre
about
carson
of
pennsylvania
which
had
disturbed
him
in
church
his
efforts
were
crowned
with
success
krebs
accepted
carson
and
promised
to
bring
him
forward
at
ten
minutes
notice
should
the
emergency
arise
ratcliffe
was
a
great
statesman
the
smoothness
of
his
manipulation
was
marvellous
no
other
man
in
politics
indeed
no
other
man
who
had
ever
been
in
politics
in
this
country
could
his
admirers
said
have
brought
together
so
many
hostile
interests
and
made
so
fantastic
a
combination
some
men
went
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
he
would
rope
in
the
president
himself
before
the
old
man
had
time
to
swap
knives
with
the
beauty
of
his
work
consisted
in
the
skill
with
which
he
evaded
questions
of
principle
as
he
wisely
said
the
issue
now
involved
was
not
one
of
principle
but
of
power
the
fate
of
that
noble
party
to
which
they
all
belonged
and
which
had
a
record
that
could
never
be
forgotten
depended
on
their
letting
principle
alone
their
principle
must
be
the
want
of
principles
there
were
indeed
individuals
who
said
in
reply
that
ratcliffe
had
made
promises
which
never
could
be
carried
out
and
there
were
almost
superhuman
elements
of
discord
in
the
combination
but
as
ratcliffe
shrewdly
rejoined
he
only
wanted
it
to
last
a
week
and
he
guessed
his
promises
would
hold
it
up
for
that
time
such
was
the
situation
when
on
monday
afternoon
the
arrived
in
washington
and
the
comedy
began
the
new
president
was
almost
as
much
as
abraham
lincoln
or
franklin
pierce
an
unknown
quantity
in
political
mathematics
in
the
national
convention
of
the
party
nine
months
before
after
some
dozens
of
fruitless
ballots
in
which
ratcliffe
wanted
but
three
votes
of
a
majority
his
opponents
had
done
what
he
was
now
doing
they
had
laid
aside
their
principles
and
set
up
for
their
candidate
a
plain
indiana
farmer
whose
political
experience
was
limited
to
in
his
native
state
and
to
one
term
as
governor
they
had
pitched
upon
him
not
because
they
thought
him
competent
but
because
they
hoped
by
doing
so
to
detach
indiana
from
ratcliffe
following
and
they
were
so
successful
that
within
fifteen
minutes
ratcliffe
friends
were
routed
and
the
presidency
had
fallen
upon
this
new
political
buddha
he
had
begun
his
career
as
a
in
a
quarry
and
was
not
unreasonably
proud
of
the
fact
during
the
campaign
this
incident
had
of
course
filled
a
large
space
in
the
public
mind
or
more
exactly
in
the
public
eye
the
of
the
wabash
he
was
sometimes
called
at
others
the
hoosier
quarryman
but
his
favourite
appellation
was
old
granite
although
this
last
endearing
name
owing
to
an
unfortunate
similarity
of
sound
was
seized
upon
by
his
opponents
and
distorted
into
old
he
had
been
painted
on
many
thousand
yards
of
cotton
sheeting
either
with
a
terrific
smashing
the
skulls
which
figured
as
of
his
political
opponents
or
splitting
by
gigantic
blows
a
huge
rock
typical
of
the
opposing
party
his
opponents
in
their
turn
had
paraded
illuminations
representing
the
quarryman
in
the
garb
of
a
convict
breaking
the
heads
of
ratcliffe
and
other
political
leaders
with
a
very
feeble
hammer
or
as
old
granny
in
pauper
rags
hopelessly
repairing
with
the
same
heads
the
impossible
roads
which
typified
the
and
miry
ways
of
his
party
but
these
violations
of
decency
and
good
sense
were
universally
reproved
by
the
virtuous
and
it
was
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
the
purest
and
most
highly
cultivated
newspaper
editors
on
his
side
without
excepting
those
of
boston
itself
agreed
with
one
voice
that
the
was
a
noble
type
of
man
perhaps
the
very
noblest
that
had
appeared
to
adorn
this
country
since
the
incomparable
washington
that
he
was
honest
all
admitted
that
is
to
say
all
who
voted
for
him
this
is
a
general
characteristic
of
all
new
presidents
he
himself
took
great
pride
in
his
honesty
which
is
a
quality
peculiar
to
nature
noblemen
owing
nothing
as
he
conceived
to
politicians
but
sympathising
through
every
fibre
of
his
unselfish
nature
with
the
impulses
and
aspirations
of
the
people
he
affirmed
it
to
be
his
first
duty
to
protect
the
people
from
those
vultures
as
he
called
them
those
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
those
harpies
those
hyenas
the
politicians
epithets
which
as
generally
interpreted
meant
ratcliffe
and
ratcliffe
friends
his
cardinal
principle
in
politics
was
hostility
to
ratcliffe
yet
he
was
not
vindictive
he
came
to
washington
determined
to
be
the
father
of
his
country
to
gain
a
proud
immortality
and
a
upon
this
gentleman
ratcliffe
had
let
loose
all
the
forms
of
pressure
which
could
be
set
in
motion
either
in
or
out
of
washington
from
the
moment
when
he
had
left
his
humble
cottage
in
southern
indiana
he
had
been
captured
by
ratcliffe
friends
and
smothered
in
demonstrations
of
affection
they
had
never
allowed
him
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
they
had
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
most
cordial
attachment
existed
between
him
and
his
party
on
his
arrival
in
washington
they
systematically
cut
him
off
from
contact
with
any
influences
but
their
own
this
was
not
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
for
great
as
he
was
he
liked
to
be
told
of
his
greatness
and
they
made
him
feel
himself
a
colossus
even
the
few
personal
friends
in
his
company
were
manipulated
with
the
utmost
care
and
their
weaknesses
put
to
use
before
they
had
been
in
washington
a
single
day
not
that
ratcliffe
had
anything
to
do
with
all
this
underhand
and
grovelling
intrigue
ratcliffe
was
a
man
of
dignity
and
who
left
details
to
his
subordinates
he
waited
calmly
until
the
president
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
his
journey
should
begin
to
feel
the
effect
of
a
washington
atmosphere
then
on
wednesday
morning
ratcliffe
left
his
rooms
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
on
his
way
to
the
senate
and
called
at
the
president
hotel
he
was
ushered
into
a
large
apartment
in
which
the
new
chief
magistrate
was
holding
court
although
at
sight
of
ratcliffe
the
other
visitors
edged
away
or
took
their
hats
and
left
the
room
the
president
proved
to
be
a
man
of
sixty
with
a
hooked
nose
and
thin
straight
hair
his
voice
was
rougher
than
his
features
and
he
received
ratcliffe
awkwardly
he
had
suffered
since
his
departure
from
indiana
out
there
it
had
seemed
a
mere
as
he
expressed
it
to
brush
ratcliffe
aside
but
in
washington
the
thing
was
somehow
different
even
his
own
indiana
friends
looked
grave
when
he
talked
of
it
and
shook
their
heads
they
advised
him
to
be
cautious
and
gain
time
to
lead
ratcliffe
on
and
if
possible
to
throw
on
him
the
responsibility
of
a
quarrel
he
was
therefore
like
a
brown
bear
undergoing
the
process
of
taming
very
very
rough
and
at
the
same
time
very
much
bewildered
and
a
little
frightened
ratcliffe
sat
ten
minutes
with
him
and
obtained
information
in
regard
to
pains
which
the
president
had
suffered
during
the
previous
night
in
consequence
as
he
believed
of
an
in
fresh
lobster
a
luxury
in
which
he
had
found
a
diversion
from
the
cares
of
state
so
soon
as
this
matter
was
explained
and
condoled
upon
ratcliffe
rose
and
took
leave
every
device
known
to
politicians
was
now
in
full
play
against
the
hoosier
quarryman
state
delegations
with
contradictory
requests
were
poured
in
upon
him
among
which
that
of
massachusetts
presented
as
its
only
prayer
the
appointment
of
gore
to
the
spanish
mission
difficulties
were
invented
to
embarrass
and
worry
him
false
leads
were
suggested
and
false
information
carefully
mingled
with
true
a
wild
dance
was
kept
up
under
his
eyes
from
daylight
to
midnight
until
his
brain
reeled
with
the
effort
to
follow
it
means
were
also
found
to
convert
one
of
his
personal
confidential
friends
who
had
come
with
him
from
indiana
and
who
had
more
brains
or
less
principle
than
the
others
from
him
every
word
of
the
president
was
brought
directly
to
ear
early
on
friday
morning
thomas
lord
a
rival
of
the
late
samuel
baker
and
heir
to
his
triumphs
appeared
in
ratcliffe
rooms
while
the
senator
was
consuming
his
lonely
egg
and
chop
lord
had
been
chosen
to
take
general
charge
of
the
presidential
party
and
to
direct
all
matters
connected
with
ratcliffe
interests
some
people
might
consider
this
the
work
of
a
spy
he
looked
on
it
as
a
public
duty
he
reported
that
old
granny
had
at
last
shown
signs
of
weakness
late
the
previous
evening
when
according
to
his
custom
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
company
with
his
of
followers
he
had
again
fallen
upon
the
subject
of
ratcliffe
and
with
a
volley
of
oaths
had
sworn
that
he
would
show
him
his
place
yet
and
that
he
meant
to
offer
him
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
that
would
make
him
sicker
than
a
stuck
from
this
remark
and
some
explanatory
hints
that
followed
it
seemed
that
the
quarryman
had
abandoned
his
scheme
of
putting
ratcliffe
to
immediate
political
death
and
had
now
undertaken
to
invite
him
into
a
cabinet
which
was
to
be
specially
constructed
to
thwart
and
humiliate
him
the
president
it
appeared
warmly
applauded
the
remark
of
one
counsellor
that
ratcliffe
was
safer
in
the
cabinet
than
in
the
senate
and
that
it
would
be
easy
to
kick
him
out
when
the
time
came
ratcliffe
smiled
grimly
as
lord
with
much
clever
mimicry
described
the
president
peculiarities
of
language
and
manner
but
he
said
nothing
and
waited
for
the
event
the
same
evening
came
a
note
from
the
president
private
secretary
requesting
his
attendance
if
possible
saturday
morning
at
ten
the
note
was
curt
and
cool
ratcliffe
merely
sent
back
word
that
he
would
come
and
felt
a
little
regret
that
the
president
should
not
know
enough
etiquette
to
understand
that
this
verbal
answer
was
intended
as
a
hint
to
improve
his
manners
he
did
come
accordingly
and
found
the
president
looking
blacker
than
before
this
time
there
was
no
avoiding
of
tender
subjects
the
president
meant
to
show
ratcliffe
by
the
decision
of
his
course
that
he
was
master
of
the
situation
he
broke
at
once
into
the
middle
of
the
matter
i
sent
for
you
said
he
to
consult
with
you
about
my
cabinet
here
is
a
list
of
the
gentlemen
i
intend
to
invite
into
it
you
will
see
that
i
have
got
you
down
for
the
treasury
will
you
look
at
the
list
and
say
what
you
think
of
it
ratcliffe
took
the
paper
but
laid
it
at
once
on
the
table
without
looking
at
it
i
can
have
no
objection
said
he
to
any
cabinet
you
may
appoint
provided
i
am
not
included
in
it
my
wish
is
to
remain
where
i
am
there
i
can
serve
your
administration
better
than
in
the
then
you
refuse
growled
the
president
by
no
means
i
only
decline
to
offer
any
advice
or
even
to
hear
the
names
of
my
proposed
colleagues
until
it
is
decided
that
my
services
are
necessary
if
they
are
i
shall
accept
without
caring
with
whom
i
the
president
glared
at
him
with
an
uneasy
look
what
was
to
be
done
next
he
wanted
time
to
think
but
ratcliffe
was
there
and
must
be
disposed
of
he
involuntarily
became
more
civil
mr
ratcliffe
your
refusal
would
knock
everything
on
the
head
i
thought
that
matter
was
all
fixed
what
more
can
i
do
but
ratcliffe
had
no
mind
to
let
the
president
out
of
his
clutches
so
easily
and
a
long
conversation
followed
during
which
he
forced
his
antagonist
into
the
position
of
urging
him
to
take
the
treasury
in
order
to
prevent
some
undefined
but
portentous
mischief
in
the
senate
all
that
could
be
agreed
upon
was
that
ratcliffe
should
give
a
positive
answer
within
two
days
and
on
that
agreement
he
took
his
leave
as
he
passed
through
the
corridor
a
number
of
gentlemen
were
waiting
for
interviews
with
the
president
and
among
them
was
the
whole
pennsylvania
delegation
ready
for
biz
as
tom
lord
remarked
with
a
wink
ratcliffe
drew
krebs
aside
and
they
exchanged
a
few
words
as
he
passed
out
ten
minutes
afterwards
the
delegation
was
admitted
and
some
of
its
members
were
a
little
surprised
to
hear
their
spokesman
senator
krebs
press
with
extreme
earnestness
and
in
their
names
the
appointment
of
josiah
carson
to
a
place
in
the
cabinet
when
they
had
been
given
to
understand
that
they
came
to
recommend
jared
caldwell
as
postmaster
of
philadelphia
but
pennsylvania
is
a
great
and
virtuous
state
whose
representatives
have
entire
confidence
in
their
chief
not
one
of
them
so
much
as
winked
the
dance
of
democracy
round
the
president
now
began
again
with
wilder
energy
ratcliffe
launched
his
last
bolts
his
delay
was
a
mere
cover
for
bringing
new
influences
to
bear
he
needed
no
delay
he
wanted
no
time
for
reflection
the
president
had
undertaken
to
put
him
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
either
to
force
him
into
a
hostile
and
treacherous
cabinet
or
to
throw
on
him
the
blame
of
a
refusal
and
a
quarrel
he
meant
to
embrace
one
of
the
horns
and
to
impale
the
president
on
it
and
he
felt
perfect
confidence
in
his
own
success
he
meant
to
accept
the
treasury
and
he
was
ready
to
back
himself
with
a
heavy
wager
to
get
the
government
entirely
into
his
own
hands
within
six
weeks
his
contempt
for
the
hoosier
was
unbounded
and
his
confidence
in
himself
more
absolute
than
ever
busy
as
he
was
the
senator
made
his
appearance
the
next
evening
at
lee
and
finding
her
alone
with
sybil
who
was
occupied
with
her
own
little
devices
ratcliffe
told
madeleine
the
story
of
his
experience
he
did
not
dwell
on
his
exploits
on
the
contrary
he
quite
ignored
those
elaborate
arrangements
which
had
taken
from
the
president
his
power
of
volition
his
picture
presented
himself
solitary
and
unprotected
in
the
character
of
that
honest
beast
who
was
invited
to
dine
with
the
lion
and
saw
that
all
the
footmarks
of
his
predecessors
led
into
the
cave
and
none
away
from
it
he
described
in
humorous
detail
his
interviews
with
the
indiana
lion
and
the
particulars
of
the
surfeit
of
lobster
as
given
in
the
president
dialect
he
even
repeated
to
her
the
story
told
him
by
tom
lord
without
omitting
oaths
or
gestures
he
told
her
how
matters
stood
at
the
moment
and
how
the
president
had
laid
a
trap
for
him
which
he
could
not
escape
he
must
either
enter
a
cabinet
constructed
on
purpose
to
thwart
him
and
with
the
certainty
of
ignominious
dismissal
at
the
first
opportunity
or
he
must
refuse
an
offer
of
friendship
which
would
throw
on
him
the
blame
of
a
quarrel
and
enable
the
president
to
charge
all
future
difficulties
to
the
account
of
ratcliffe
insatiable
and
now
lee
he
continued
with
increasing
seriousness
of
tone
i
want
your
advice
what
shall
i
do
even
this
half
revelation
of
the
meanness
which
distorted
politics
this
view
of
human
nature
in
its
naked
deformity
playing
pranks
with
the
interests
of
forty
million
people
disgusted
and
depressed
madeleine
mind
ratclife
spared
her
nothing
except
the
exposure
of
his
own
moral
sores
he
carefully
called
her
attention
to
every
leprous
taint
upon
his
neighbours
persons
to
every
rag
in
their
foul
clothing
to
every
slimy
and
fetid
pool
that
lay
beside
their
path
it
was
his
way
of
bringing
his
own
qualities
into
relief
he
meant
that
she
should
go
hand
in
hand
with
him
through
the
brimstone
lake
and
the
more
repulsive
it
seemed
to
her
the
more
overwhelming
would
his
superiority
become
he
meant
to
destroy
those
doubts
of
his
character
which
carrington
was
so
carefully
fostering
to
rouse
her
sympathy
to
stimulate
her
feminine
sense
of
when
he
asked
this
question
she
looked
up
at
him
with
an
expression
of
indignant
pride
as
she
spoke
i
say
again
ratcliffe
what
i
said
once
before
do
whatever
is
most
for
the
public
and
what
is
most
for
the
public
good
madeleine
half
opened
her
mouth
to
reply
then
hesitated
and
stared
silently
into
the
fire
before
her
what
was
indeed
most
for
the
public
good
where
did
the
public
good
enter
at
all
into
this
maze
of
personal
intrigue
this
wilderness
of
stunted
natures
where
no
straight
road
was
to
be
found
but
only
the
tortuous
and
aimless
tracks
of
beasts
and
things
that
crawl
where
was
she
to
look
for
a
principle
to
guide
an
ideal
to
set
up
and
to
point
at
ratcliffe
resumed
his
appeal
and
his
manner
was
more
serious
than
ever
i
am
hard
pressed
lee
my
enemies
encompass
me
about
they
mean
to
ruin
me
i
honestly
wish
to
do
my
duty
you
once
said
that
personal
considerations
should
have
no
weight
very
well
throw
them
away
and
now
tell
me
what
i
should
for
the
first
time
lee
began
to
feel
his
power
he
was
simple
straightforward
earnest
his
words
moved
her
how
should
she
imagine
that
he
was
playing
upon
her
sensitive
nature
precisely
as
he
played
upon
the
president
coarse
one
and
that
this
heavy
western
politician
had
the
instincts
of
a
wild
indian
in
their
sharpness
and
quickness
of
perception
that
he
divined
her
character
and
read
it
as
he
read
the
faces
and
tones
of
thousands
from
day
to
day
she
was
uneasy
under
his
eye
she
began
a
sentence
hesitated
in
the
middle
and
broke
down
she
lost
her
command
of
thought
and
sat
he
had
to
draw
her
out
of
the
confusion
he
had
himself
made
i
see
your
meaning
in
your
face
you
say
that
i
should
accept
the
duty
and
disregard
the
i
do
know
said
madeleine
hesitatingly
yes
i
think
that
would
be
my
and
when
i
fall
a
sacrifice
to
that
man
envy
and
intrigue
what
will
you
think
then
lee
will
you
not
join
the
rest
of
the
world
and
say
that
i
overreached
myself
and
walked
into
this
trap
with
my
eyes
open
and
for
my
own
objects
do
you
think
i
shall
ever
be
thought
better
of
for
getting
caught
here
i
do
parade
high
moral
views
like
our
friend
french
i
wo
cant
about
virtue
but
i
do
claim
that
in
my
public
life
i
have
tried
to
do
right
will
you
do
me
the
justice
to
think
so
madeleine
still
struggled
to
prevent
herself
from
being
drawn
into
indefinite
promises
of
sympathy
with
this
man
she
would
keep
him
at
arm
length
whatever
her
sympathies
might
be
she
would
not
pledge
herself
to
espouse
his
cause
she
turned
upon
him
with
an
effort
and
said
that
her
thoughts
now
or
at
any
time
were
folly
and
nonsense
and
that
the
consciousness
of
was
the
only
reward
any
public
man
had
a
right
to
expect
and
yet
you
are
a
hard
critic
lee
if
your
thoughts
are
what
you
say
your
words
are
not
you
judge
with
the
judgment
of
abstract
principles
and
you
wield
the
bolts
of
divine
justice
you
look
on
and
condemn
but
you
refuse
to
acquit
when
i
come
to
you
on
the
verge
of
what
is
likely
to
be
the
fatal
plunge
of
my
life
and
ask
you
only
for
some
clue
to
the
moral
principle
that
ought
to
guide
me
you
look
on
and
say
that
virtue
is
its
own
reward
and
you
do
not
even
say
where
virtue
i
confess
my
sins
said
madeleine
meekly
and
despondently
life
is
more
complicated
than
i
i
shall
be
guided
by
your
advice
said
ratcliffe
i
shall
walk
into
that
den
of
wild
beasts
since
you
think
i
ought
but
i
shall
hold
you
to
your
responsibility
you
can
not
refuse
to
see
me

ratcliffe
looked
at
her
a
moment
with
a
troubled
and
careworn
face
his
eyes
seemed
deep
sunk
in
their
dark
circles
and
his
voice
was
pathetic
in
its
intensity
duty
is
duty
for
you
as
well
as
for
me
i
have
a
right
to
the
help
of
all
pure
minds
you
have
no
right
to
refuse
it
how
can
you
reject
your
own
responsibility
and
hold
me
to
mine
almost
as
he
spoke
he
rose
and
took
his
departure
leaving
her
no
time
to
do
more
than
murmur
again
her
ineffectual
protest
after
he
was
gone
lee
sat
long
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
reflecting
upon
what
he
had
said
her
mind
was
bewildered
by
the
new
suggestions
which
ratcliffe
had
thrown
out
what
woman
of
thirty
with
aspirations
for
the
infinite
could
resist
an
attack
like
this
what
woman
with
a
soul
could
see
before
her
the
most
powerful
public
man
of
her
time
appealing
with
a
face
furrowed
by
anxieties
and
a
voice
vibrating
with
only
affection
to
her
for
counsel
and
sympathy
without
yielding
some
response
and
what
woman
could
have
helped
bowing
her
head
to
that
rebuke
of
her
judgment
coming
as
it
did
from
one
who
in
the
same
breath
appealed
to
that
judgment
as
final
ratcliffe
too
had
a
curious
instinct
for
human
weaknesses
no
magnetic
needle
was
ever
truer
than
his
finger
when
he
touched
the
vulnerable
spot
in
an
opponent
mind
lee
was
not
to
be
reached
by
an
appeal
to
religious
sentiment
to
ambition
or
to
affection
any
such
appeal
would
have
fallen
flat
on
her
ears
and
destroyed
its
own
hopes
but
she
was
a
woman
to
the
very
last
drop
of
her
blood
she
could
not
be
induced
to
love
ratcliffe
but
she
might
be
deluded
into
sacrificing
herself
for
him
she
atoned
for
want
of
devotion
to
god
by
devotion
to
man
she
had
a
woman
natural
tendency
towards
asceticism
all
through
life
she
had
made
painful
efforts
to
understand
and
follow
out
her
duty
ratcliffe
knew
her
weak
point
when
he
attacked
her
from
this
side
like
all
great
orators
and
advocates
he
was
an
actor
the
more
effective
because
of
a
certain
dignified
air
that
forbade
familiarity
he
had
appealed
to
her
sympathy
her
sense
of
right
and
of
duty
to
her
courage
her
loyalty
her
whole
higher
nature
and
while
he
made
this
appeal
he
felt
more
than
half
convinced
that
he
was
all
he
pretended
to
be
and
that
he
really
had
a
right
to
her
devotion
what
wonder
that
she
in
her
turn
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
admit
that
right
she
knew
him
now
better
than
carrington
or
jacobi
knew
him
surely
a
man
who
spoke
as
he
spoke
had
noble
instincts
and
lofty
aims
was
not
his
career
a
thousand
times
more
important
than
hers
if
he
in
his
isolation
and
his
cares
needed
her
assistance
had
she
an
excuse
for
refusing
it
what
was
there
in
her
aimless
and
useless
life
which
made
it
so
precious
that
she
could
not
afford
to
fling
it
into
the
gutter
if
need
be
on
the
bare
chance
of
enriching
some
fuller
existence
chapter

may
be
some

about
a

makes

when
a

the

against

the

sometimes
quail

floating

on

which
experience

long

condemned
as

have
thus
far
floated
better
by
its

than
the

ever
did

so
that
it
will
be
a
long
time
yet
before
society
repents
whether
the
new
president
and
his
chief
rival

ratcliffe
were
or
were
not
servants
of
the

of

not

here
servants
they
were
to
some
one
no
doubt
many
of
those
who
call
themselves
servants
of
the
people
are
no
better
than
wolves
in
clothing
or
asses
in
lions
skins
one
may
see
scores
of
them
any
day
in
the
capitol
when
congress
is
in
session
making
noisy
demonstrations
or
more
usefully
doing
nothing
a
wiser
generation
will
employ
them
in
manual
labour
as
it
is
they
serve
only
themselves
but
there
are
two
officers
at
least
whose
service
is
real
the
president
and
his
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
hoosier
quarryman
had
not
been
a
week
in
washington
before
he
was
heartily
for
indiana
no
in
a
cheap
was
ever
more
harassed
everyone
conspired
against
him
his
enemies
gave
him
no
peace
all
washington
was
laughing
at
his
blunders
and
ribald
sheets
published
on
a
sunday
took
delight
in
printing
the
new
chief
magistrate
sayings
and
doings
chronicled
with
outrageous
humour
and
placed
by
malicious
hands
where
the
president
could
not
but
see
them
he
was
sensitive
to
ridicule
and
it
mortified
him
to
the
heart
to
find
that
remarks
and
acts
which
to
him
seemed
sensible
enough
should
be
capable
of
such
perversion
then
he
was
overwhelmed
with
public
business
it
came
upon
him
in
a
deluge
and
he
now
in
his
despair
no
longer
tried
to
control
it
he
let
it
pass
over
him
like
a
wave
his
mind
was
muddied
by
the
innumerable
visitors
to
whom
he
had
to
listen
but
his
greatest
anxiety
was
the
inaugural
address
which
distracted
as
he
was
he
could
not
finish
although
in
another
week
it
must
be
delivered
he
was
nervous
about
his
cabinet
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
do
nothing
until
he
had
disposed
of
ratcliffe
already
thanks
to
the
president
friends
ratcliffe
had
become
indispensable
still
an
enemy
of
course
but
one
whose
hands
must
be
tied
a
sort
of
sampson
to
be
kept
in
bonds
until
the
time
came
for
putting
him
out
of
the
way
but
in
the
meanwhile
to
be
utilized
this
point
being
settled
the
president
had
in
imagination
begun
to
lean
upon
him
for
the
last
few
days
he
had
postponed
everything
till
next
week
when
i
get
my
cabinet
arranged
which
meant
when
he
got
assistance
and
he
fell
into
a
panic
whenever
he
thought
of
the
chance
that
ratcliffe
might
refuse
he
was
pacing
his
room
impatiently
on
monday
morning
an
hour
before
the
time
fixed
for
ratcliffe
visit
his
feelings
still
fluctuated
violently
and
if
he
recognized
the
necessity
of
using
ratcliffe
he
was
not
the
less
determined
to
tie
ratcliffe
hands
he
must
be
made
to
come
into
a
cabinet
where
every
other
voice
would
be
against
him
he
must
be
prevented
from
having
any
patronage
to
dispose
of
he
must
be
induced
to
accept
these
conditions
at
the
start
how
present
this
to
him
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
repel
him
at
once
all
this
was
needless
if
the
president
had
only
known
it
but
he
thought
himself
a
profound
statesman
and
that
his
hand
was
guiding
the
destinies
of
america
to
his
own
when
at
length
on
the
stroke
of
ten
ratcliffe
entered
the
room
the
president
turned
to
him
with
nervous
eagerness
and
almost
before
offering
his
hand
said
that
he
hoped
ratcliffe
had
come
prepared
to
begin
work
at
once
the
senator
replied
that
if
such
was
the
president
decided
wish
he
would
offer
no
further
opposition
then
the
president
drew
himself
up
in
the
attitude
of
an
american
cato
and
delivered
a
prepared
address
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
chosen
the
members
of
his
cabinet
with
a
careful
regard
to
the
public
interests
that
ratcliffe
was
essential
to
the
combination
that
he
expected
no
disagreement
on
principles
for
there
was
but
one
principle
which
he
should
consider
fundamental
namely
that
there
should
be
no
removals
from
office
except
for
cause
and
that
under
these
circumstances
he
counted
upon
ratcliffe
assistance
as
a
matter
of
patriotic
duty
to
all
this
ratcliffe
assented
without
a
word
of
objection
and
the
president
more
convinced
than
ever
of
his
own
masterly
statesmanship
breathed
more
freely
than
for
a
week
past
within
ten
minutes
they
were
actively
at
work
together
clearing
away
the
mass
of
accumulated
business
the
relief
of
the
quarryman
surprised
himself
ratcliffe
lifted
the
weight
of
affairs
from
his
shoulders
with
hardly
an
effort
he
knew
everybody
and
everything
he
took
most
of
the
president
visitors
at
once
into
his
own
hands
and
dismissed
them
with
great
rapidity
he
knew
what
they
wanted
he
knew
what
recommendations
were
strong
and
what
were
weak
who
was
to
be
treated
with
deference
and
who
was
to
be
sent
away
abruptly
where
a
blunt
refusal
was
safe
and
where
a
pledge
was
allowable
the
president
even
trusted
him
with
the
unfinished
manuscript
of
the
inaugural
address
which
ratcliffe
returned
to
him
the
next
day
with
such
notes
and
suggestions
as
left
nothing
to
be
done
beyond
copying
them
out
in
a
fair
hand
with
all
this
he
proved
himself
a
very
agreeable
companion
he
talked
well
and
enlivened
the
work
he
was
not
a
hard
taskmaster
and
when
he
saw
that
the
president
was
tired
he
boldly
asserted
that
there
was
no
more
business
that
could
not
as
well
wait
a
day
and
so
took
the
weary
out
to
drive
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
let
him
go
peacefully
to
sleep
in
the
carriage
they
dined
together
and
ratcliffe
took
care
to
send
for
tom
lord
to
amuse
them
for
tom
was
a
wit
and
a
humourist
and
kept
the
president
in
a
laugh
lord
ordered
the
dinner
and
chose
the
wines
he
could
be
coarse
enough
to
suit
even
the
president
palate
and
ratcliffe
was
not
behindhand
when
the
new
secretary
went
away
at
ten
that
night
his
chief
who
was
in
high
good
humour
with
his
dinner
his
champagne
and
his
conversation
swore
with
some
unnecessary
granite
oaths
that
ratcliffe
was
a
clever
fellow
anyhow
and
he
was
glad
that
job
was
the
truth
was
that
ratcliffe
had
now
precisely
ten
days
before
the
new
cabinet
could
be
set
in
motion
and
in
these
ten
days
he
must
establish
his
authority
over
the
president
so
firmly
that
nothing
could
shake
it
he
was
diligent
in
good
works
very
soon
the
court
began
to
feel
his
hand
if
a
business
letter
or
a
written
memorial
came
in
the
president
found
it
easy
to
endorse
referred
to
the
secretary
of
the
if
a
visitor
wanted
anything
for
himself
or
another
the
invariable
reply
came
to
be
just
mention
it
to
ratcliffe
or
i
guess
ratcliffe
will
see
to
before
long
he
even
made
jokes
in
a
catonian
manner
jokes
that
were
not
peculiarly
witty
but
somewhat
gruff
and
boorish
yet
significant
of
a
resigned
and
mind
one
morning
he
ordered
ratcliffe
to
take
an
ship
of
war
and
attack
the
sioux
in
montana
seeing
that
he
was
in
charge
of
the
army
and
navy
and
indians
at
once
and
jack
of
all
trades
and
again
he
told
a
naval
officer
who
wanted
a
that
he
had
better
get
ratcliffe
to
sit
on
him
for
he
was
a
whole
by
himself
that
ratcliffe
held
his
chief
in
no
less
contempt
than
before
was
probable
but
not
certain
for
he
kept
silence
on
the
subject
before
the
world
and
looked
solemn
whenever
the
president
was
mentioned
before
three
days
were
over
the
president
with
a
little
more
than
his
usual
abruptness
suddenly
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
this
fellow
carson
whom
the
pennsylvanians
were
bothering
him
to
put
in
his
cabinet
ratcliffe
was
guarded
he
scarcely
knew
the
man
carson
was
not
in
politics
he
believed
but
was
pretty
respectable
for
a
pennsylvanian
the
president
returned
to
the
subject
several
times
got
out
his
list
of
cabinet
officers
and
figured
industriously
upon
it
with
a
rather
perplexed
face
called
ratcliffe
to
help
him
and
at
last
the
slate
was
fairly
broken
and
ratcliffe
eyes
gleamed
when
the
president
caused
his
list
of
nominations
to
be
sent
to
the
senate
on
the
march
and
josiah
carson
of
pennsylvania
was
promptly
confirmed
as
secretary
of
the
interior
but
his
eyes
gleamed
still
more
humorously
when
a
few
days
afterwards
the
president
gave
him
a
long
list
of
some
two
score
names
and
asked
him
to
find
places
for
them
he
assented
with
a
remark
that
it
might
be
necessary
to
make
a
few
removals
to
provide
for
these
cases
oh
well
said
the
president
i
guess
there
just
about
as
many
as
that
had
ought
to
go
out
anyway
these
are
friends
of
mine
got
to
be
looked
after
just
stuff
in
even
he
felt
a
little
awkward
about
it
and
to
do
him
justice
this
was
the
last
that
was
heard
about
the
fundamental
rule
of
his
administration
removals
were
fast
and
furious
until
all
indiana
became
easy
in
circumstances
and
it
was
not
to
be
denied
that
by
one
means
or
another
ratcliffe
friends
did
come
into
their
fair
share
of
the
public
money
perhaps
the
president
thought
it
best
to
wink
at
such
use
of
the
treasury
patronage
for
the
present
or
was
already
a
little
overawed
by
his
secretary
ratcliffe
work
was
done
the
public
had
with
the
help
of
some
clever
intrigue
driven
its
servants
into
the
traces
even
an
indiana
could
be
taught
that
his
personal
prejudices
must
yield
to
the
public
service
what
mischief
the
selfishness
the
ambition
or
the
ignorance
of
these
men
might
do
was
another
matter
as
the
affair
stood
the
president
was
the
victim
of
his
own
schemes
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
at
some
future
day
ratcliffe
would
think
it
worth
his
while
to
strangle
his
chief
by
some
quiet
eastern
intrigue
but
the
time
had
gone
by
when
the
president
could
make
use
of
either
the
or
the
axe
upon
him
all
this
passed
while
lee
was
quietly
puzzling
her
poor
little
brain
about
her
duty
and
her
responsibility
to
ratcliffe
who
meanwhile
rarely
failed
to
find
himself
on
sunday
evenings
by
her
side
in
her
parlour
where
his
rights
were
now
so
well
established
that
no
one
presumed
to
contest
his
seat
unless
it
were
old
jacobi
who
from
time
to
time
reminded
him
that
he
was
fallible
and
mortal
occasionally
though
not
often
ratcliffe
came
at
other
times
as
when
he
persuaded
lee
to
be
present
at
the
inauguration
and
to
call
on
the
president
wife
madeleine
and
sybil
went
to
the
capitol
and
had
the
best
places
to
see
and
hear
the
inauguration
as
well
as
a
cold
march
wind
would
allow
lee
found
fault
with
the
ceremony
it
was
of
the
earth
earthy
she
said
an
elderly
western
farmer
with
silver
spectacles
new
and
glossy
evening
clothes
bony
features
and
stiff
thin
gray
hair
trying
to
address
a
large
crowd
of
people
under
the
drawbacks
of
a
piercing
wind
and
a
cold
in
his
head
was
not
a
hero
sybil
mind
was
lost
in
wondering
whether
the
president
would
not
soon
die
of
pneumonia
even
this
experience
however
was
happy
when
compared
with
that
of
the
call
upon
the
president
wife
after
which
madeleine
decided
to
leave
the
new
dynasty
alone
in
future
the
lady
who
was
somewhat
stout
and
and
whom
lee
declared
she
would
engage
as
a
cook
showed
qualities
which
seen
under
that
fierce
light
which
beats
upon
a
throne
seemed
ungracious
her
antipathy
to
ratcliffe
was
more
violent
than
her
husband
and
was
even
more
openly
expressed
until
the
president
was
quite
put
out
of
countenance
by
it
she
extended
her
hostility
to
every
one
who
could
be
supposed
to
be
ratcliffe
friend
and
the
newspapers
as
well
as
private
gossip
had
marked
out
lee
as
one
who
by
an
alliance
with
ratcliffe
was
aiming
at
supplanting
her
own
rule
over
the
white
house
hence
when
lightfoot
lee
was
announced
and
the
two
sisters
were
ushered
into
the
presidential
parlour
she
put
on
a
coldly
patronizing
air
and
in
reply
to
madeleine
hope
that
she
found
washington
agreeable
she
intimated
that
there
was
much
in
washington
which
struck
her
as
awful
wicked
especially
the
women
and
looking
at
sybil
she
spoke
of
the
style
of
dress
in
this
city
which
she
said
she
meant
to
do
what
she
could
to
put
a
stop
to
she
heard
tell
that
people
sent
to
paris
for
their
gowns
just
as
though
america
was
good
enough
to
make
one
clothes
jacob
all
presidents
wives
speak
of
their
husbands
by
their
first
names
had
promised
her
to
get
a
law
passed
against
it
in
her
town
in
indiana
a
young
woman
who
was
seen
on
the
street
in
such
clothes
would
be
spoken
to
at
these
remarks
made
with
an
air
and
in
a
temper
quite
unmistakable
madeleine
became
exasperated
beyond
measure
and
said
that
washington
would
be
pleased
to
see
the
president
do
something
in
regard
to
or
any
other
reform
and
with
this
allusion
to
the
president
reform
speeches
lee
turned
her
back
and
left
the
room
followed
by
sybil
in
convulsions
of
suppressed
laughter
which
would
not
have
been
suppressed
had
she
seen
the
face
of
their
hostess
as
the
door
shut
behind
them
and
the
energy
with
which
she
shook
her
head
and
said
see
if
i
do
reform
you
yet
you
jade
lee
gave
ratcliffe
a
lively
account
of
this
interview
and
he
laughed
nearly
as
convulsively
as
sybil
over
it
though
he
tried
to
pacify
her
by
saying
that
the
president
most
intimate
friends
openly
declared
his
wife
to
be
insane
and
that
he
himself
was
the
person
most
afraid
of
her
but
lee
declared
that
the
president
was
as
bad
as
his
wife
that
an
equally
good
president
and
president
wife
could
be
picked
up
in
any
between
the
lakes
and
the
ohio
and
that
no
inducement
should
ever
make
her
go
near
that
coarse
washerwoman
again
ratcliffe
did
not
attempt
to
change
lee
opinion
indeed
he
knew
better
than
any
man
how
presidents
were
made
and
he
had
his
own
opinions
in
regard
to
the
process
as
well
as
the
fabric
produced
nothing
lee
could
say
now
affected
him
he
threw
off
his
responsibility
and
she
found
it
suddenly
resting
on
her
own
shoulders
when
she
spoke
with
indignation
of
the
wholesale
removals
from
office
with
which
the
new
administration
marked
its
advent
to
power
he
told
her
the
story
of
the
president
fundamental
principle
and
asked
her
what
she
would
have
him
do
he
meant
to
tie
my
hands
said
ratcliffe
and
to
leave
his
own
free
and
i
accepted
the
condition
can
i
resign
now
on
such
a
ground
as
this
and
madeleine
was
obliged
to
agree
that
he
could
not
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
many
removals
he
made
in
his
own
interest
or
how
far
he
had
outwitted
the
president
at
his
own
game
he
stood
before
her
a
victim
and
a
patriot
every
step
he
had
taken
had
been
taken
with
her
approval
he
was
now
in
office
to
prevent
what
evil
he
could
not
to
be
responsible
for
the
evil
that
was
done
and
he
honestly
assured
her
that
much
worse
men
would
come
in
when
he
went
out
as
the
president
would
certainly
take
good
care
that
he
did
go
out
when
the
moment
arrived
lee
had
the
chance
now
to
carry
out
her
scheme
in
coming
to
washington
for
she
was
already
deep
in
the
mire
of
politics
and
could
see
with
every
advantage
how
the
great
machine
floundered
about
bespattering
with
mud
even
her
own
pure
garments
ratcliffe
himself
since
entering
the
treasury
had
begun
to
talk
with
a
sneer
of
the
way
in
which
laws
were
made
and
openly
said
that
he
wondered
how
government
got
on
at
all
yet
he
declared
still
that
this
particular
government
was
the
highest
expression
of
political
thought
lee
stared
at
him
and
wondered
whether
he
knew
what
thought
was
to
her
the
government
seemed
to
have
less
thought
in
it
than
one
of
sybil
gowns
for
if
they
like
the
government
were
monstrously
costly
they
were
at
least
adapted
to
their
purpose
the
parts
fitted
together
and
they
were
neither
awkward
nor
unwieldy
there
was
nothing
very
encouraging
in
all
this
but
it
was
better
than
new
york
at
least
it
gave
her
something
to
look
at
and
to
think
about
even
lord
dunbeg
preached
practical
philanthropy
to
her
by
the
hour
ratcliffe
too
was
compelled
to
drag
himself
out
of
the
rut
of
machine
politics
and
to
justify
his
right
of
admission
to
her
house
there
french
discoursed
at
great
length
until
the
fourth
of
march
sent
him
home
to
connecticut
and
he
brought
more
than
one
intelligent
member
of
congress
to
lee
parlour
underneath
the
scum
floating
on
the
surface
of
politics
madeleine
felt
that
there
was
a
sort
of
healthy
ocean
current
of
honest
purpose
which
swept
the
scum
before
it
and
kept
the
mass
pure
this
was
enough
to
draw
her
on
she
reconciled
herself
to
accepting
the
ratcliffian
morals
for
she
could
see
no
choice
she
herself
had
approved
every
step
she
had
seen
him
take
she
could
not
deny
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
a
double
standard
of
morality
but
where
was
it
ratcliffe
seemed
to
her
to
be
doing
good
work
with
as
pure
means
as
he
had
at
hand
he
ought
to
be
encouraged
not
reviled
what
was
she
that
she
should
stand
in
judgment
others
watched
her
progress
with
less
satisfaction
nathan
gore
was
one
of
these
for
he
came
in
one
evening
looking
much
out
of
temper
and
sitting
down
by
her
side
he
said
he
had
come
to
bid
and
to
thank
her
for
the
kindness
she
had
shown
him
he
was
to
leave
washington
the
next
morning
she
too
expressed
her
warm
regret
but
added
that
she
hoped
he
was
only
going
in
order
to
take
his
passage
to
madrid
he
shook
his
head
i
am
going
to
take
my
passage
said
he
but
not
to
madrid
the
fates
have
cut
that
thread
the
president
does
not
want
my
services
and
i
ca
blame
him
for
if
our
situations
were
reversed
i
should
certainly
not
want
his
he
has
an
indiana
friend
who
i
am
told
wanted
to
be
postmaster
at
indianapolis
but
as
this
did
not
suit
the
politicians
he
was
bought
off
at
the
exorbitant
price
of
the
spanish
mission
but
i
should
have
no
chance
even
if
he
were
out
of
the
way
the
president
does
not
approve
of
me
he
objects
to
the
cut
of
my
overcoat
which
is
unfortunately
an
english
one
he
also
objects
to
the
cut
of
my
hair
i
am
afraid
that
his
wife
objects
to
me
because
i
am
so
happy
as
to
be
thought
a
friend
of
madeleine
could
only
acknowledge
that
gore
case
was
a
bad
one
but
after
all
said
she
why
should
politicians
be
expected
to
love
you
literary
gentlemen
who
write
history
other
criminal
classes
are
not
expected
to
love
their
no
but
they
have
sense
enough
to
fear
them
replied
gore
vindictively
not
one
politician
living
has
the
brains
or
the
art
to
defend
his
own
cause
the
ocean
of
history
is
foul
with
the
carcases
of
such
statesmen
dead
and
forgotten
except
when
some
historian
fishes
one
of
them
up
to
gibbet
gore
was
so
much
out
of
temper
that
after
this
piece
of
extravagance
he
was
forced
to
pause
a
moment
to
recover
himself
then
he
went
on
you
are
perfectly
right
and
so
is
the
president
i
have
no
business
to
be
meddling
in
politics
it
is
not
my
place
the
next
time
you
hear
of
me
i
promise
it
shall
not
be
as
an
then
he
rapidly
changed
the
subject
saying
that
he
hoped
lee
was
soon
going
northward
again
and
that
they
might
meet
at
newport
i
do
know
replied
madeleine
the
spring
is
pleasant
here
and
we
shall
stay
till
the
warm
weather
i
gore
looked
grave
and
your
politics
said
he
are
you
satisfied
with
what
you
have
seen
i
have
got
so
far
as
to
lose
the
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
is
that
the
first
step
in
politics
gore
had
no
mind
even
for
serious
jesting
he
broke
out
into
a
long
lecture
which
sounded
like
a
chapter
of
some
future
history
but
lee
is
it
possible
that
you
do
see
what
a
wrong
path
you
are
on
if
you
want
to
know
what
the
world
is
really
doing
to
any
good
purpose
pass
a
winter
at
samarcand
at
timbuctoo
but
not
at
washington
be
a
or
a
journeyman
printer
but
not
a
congressman
here
you
will
find
nothing
but
wasted
effort
and
clumsy
do
you
think
it
a
pity
for
me
to
learn
that
asked
madeleine
when
his
long
essay
was
ended
no
replied
gore
hesitating
not
if
you
do
learn
it
but
many
people
never
get
so
far
or
only
when
too
late
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
mistress
of
it
and
have
given
up
reforming
politics
the
spaniards
have
a
proverb
that
smells
of
the
stable
but
applies
to
people
like
you
and
me
the
man
who
washes
his
donkey
head
loses
time
and
gore
took
his
leave
before
madeleine
had
time
to
grasp
all
the
impudence
of
this
last
speech
not
until
she
was
fairly
in
bed
that
night
did
it
suddenly
flash
on
her
mind
that
gore
had
dared
to
caricature
her
as
wasting
time
and
soap
on
ratcliffe
at
first
she
was
violently
angry
and
then
she
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
there
was
truth
in
the
portrait
in
secret
too
she
was
the
less
offended
because
she
half
thought
that
it
had
depended
only
on
herself
to
make
of
gore
something
more
than
a
friend
if
she
had
overheard
his
parting
words
to
carrington
she
would
have
had
still
more
reason
to
think
that
a
little
jealousy
of
ratcliffe
success
sharpened
the
barb
of
gore
enmity
take
care
of
ratcliffe
was
his
farewell
he
is
a
clever
dog
he
has
set
his
mark
on
lee
look
out
that
he
does
walk
off
with
her
a
little
startled
by
this
sudden
confidence
carrington
could
only
ask
what
he
could
do
to
prevent
it
cats
that
go
ratting
do
wear
gloves
replied
gore
who
always
carried
a
spanish
proverb
in
his
pocket
carrington
after
painful
reflection
could
only
guess
that
he
wanted
ratcliffe
enemies
to
show
their
claws
but
how
lee
not
long
afterwards
spoke
to
ratcliffe
of
her
regret
at
disappointment
and
hinted
at
his
disgust
ratcliffe
replied
that
he
had
done
what
he
could
for
gore
and
had
introduced
him
to
the
president
who
after
seeing
him
had
sworn
his
usual
granitic
oath
that
he
would
sooner
send
his
nigger
jake
to
spain
than
that
you
know
how
i
stand
added
ratcliffe
what
more
could
i
do
and
lee
implied
reproach
was
silenced
if
gore
was
little
pleased
with
ratcliffe
conduct
poor
schneidekoupon
was
still
less
so
he
turned
up
again
at
washington
not
long
after
the
inauguration
and
had
a
private
interview
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
what
passed
at
it
was
known
only
to
themselves
but
whatever
it
was
schneidekoupon
temper
was
none
the
better
for
it
from
his
conversations
with
sybil
it
seemed
that
there
was
some
question
about
appointments
in
which
his
protectionist
friends
were
interested
and
he
talked
very
openly
about
ratcliffe
want
of
good
faith
and
how
he
had
promised
everything
to
everybody
and
had
failed
to
keep
a
single
pledge
if
schneidekoupon
advice
had
been
taken
this
would
have
happened
lee
told
ratcliffe
that
schneidekoupon
seemed
out
of
temper
and
asked
the
reason
he
only
laughed
and
evaded
the
question
remarking
that
cattle
of
this
kind
were
always
complaining
unless
they
were
allowed
to
run
the
whole
government
schneidekoupon
had
nothing
to
grumble
about
no
one
had
ever
made
any
promises
to
him
but
nevertheless
schneidekoupon
confided
to
sybil
his
antipathy
to
ratcliffe
and
solemnly
begged
her
not
to
let
lee
fall
into
his
hands
to
which
sybil
answered
tartly
that
she
only
wished
schneidekoupon
would
tell
her
how
to
help
it
the
reformer
french
had
also
been
one
of
ratcliffe
backers
in
the
fight
over
the
treasury
he
remained
in
washington
a
few
days
after
the
inauguration
and
then
disappeared
leaving
cards
with
in
the
corner
at
lee
door
rumour
said
that
he
too
was
disappointed
but
he
kept
his
own
counsel
and
if
he
really
wanted
the
mission
to
belgium
he
contented
himself
with
waiting
for
it
a
respectable
proprietor
from
oregon
got
the
place
as
for
jacobi
who
was
not
disappointed
and
who
had
nothing
to
ask
for
he
was
bitterest
of
all
he
formally
offered
his
congratulations
to
ratcliffe
on
his
appointment
this
little
scene
occurred
in
lee
parlour
the
old
baron
with
his
most
suave
manner
and
his
most
voltairean
leer
said
that
in
all
his
experience
and
he
had
seen
a
great
many
court
intrigues
he
had
never
seen
anything
better
managed
than
that
about
the
treasury
ratcliffe
was
furiously
angry
and
told
the
baron
outright
that
foreign
ministers
who
insulted
the
governments
to
which
they
were
accredited
ran
a
risk
of
being
sent
home
ce
serait
toujours
un
pis
aller
said
jacobi
seating
himself
with
calmness
in
ratcliffe
favourite
chair
by
lee
side
madeleine
alarmed
as
she
was
could
not
help
interposing
and
hastily
asked
whether
that
remark
was
translatable
ah
said
the
baron
i
can
do
nothing
with
your
language
you
would
only
say
that
it
was
a
choice
of
evils
to
go
or
to
we
might
translate
it
by
saying
may
go
farther
and
fare
worse
rejoined
madeleine
and
so
the
storm
blew
over
for
the
time
and
ratcliffe
sulkily
let
the
subject
drop
nevertheless
the
two
men
never
met
in
lee
parlour
without
her
dreading
a
personal
altercation
little
by
little
what
with
jacobi
sarcasms
and
ratcliffe
roughness
they
nearly
ceased
to
speak
and
glared
at
each
other
like
quarrelsome
dogs
madeleine
was
driven
to
all
kinds
of
expedients
to
keep
the
peace
yet
at
the
same
time
she
could
not
but
be
greatly
amused
by
their
behaviour
and
as
their
hatred
of
each
other
only
stimulated
their
devotion
to
her
she
was
content
to
hold
an
even
balance
between
them
nor
were
these
all
the
awkward
consequences
of
ratcliffe
attentions
now
that
he
was
distinctly
recognized
as
an
intimate
friend
of
lee
and
possibly
her
future
husband
no
one
ventured
any
longer
to
attack
him
in
her
presence
but
nevertheless
she
was
conscious
in
a
thousand
ways
that
the
atmosphere
became
more
and
more
dense
under
the
shadow
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
spite
of
herself
she
sometimes
felt
uneasy
as
though
there
were
conspiracy
in
the
air
one
march
afternoon
she
was
sitting
by
her
fire
with
an
english
review
in
her
hand
trying
to
read
the
last
symposium
on
the
sympathies
of
eternal
punishment
when
her
servant
brought
in
a
card
and
lee
had
barely
time
to
read
the
name
of
samuel
baker
when
that
lady
followed
the
servant
into
the
room
forcing
the
countersign
in
so
effective
style
that
for
once
madeleine
was
fairly
disconcerted
her
manner
when
thus
intruded
upon
was
cool
but
in
this
case
on
carrington
account
she
tried
to
smile
courteously
and
asked
her
visitor
to
sit
down
which
baker
was
doing
without
an
invitation
very
soon
putting
her
hostess
entirely
at
her
ease
she
was
when
seen
without
her
veil
a
showy
woman
verging
on
forty
decidedly
large
tall
even
in
mourning
and
with
a
complexion
rather
fresher
than
nature
had
made
it
there
was
a
geniality
in
her
address
savouring
of
easy
washington
ways
a
fruitiness
of
smile
and
a
rich
southern
accent
that
explained
on
the
spot
her
success
in
the
lobby
she
looked
about
her
with
fine
and
approved
lee
surroundings
with
a
cordiality
so
different
from
the
northern
stinginess
of
praise
that
madeleine
was
rather
pleased
than
offended
yet
when
her
eye
rested
on
the
corot
madeleine
only
pride
she
was
evidently
perplexed
and
resorted
to
in
order
as
it
seemed
to
gain
time
for
reflection
but
she
was
not
to
be
disconcerted
even
by
corot
masterpiece
how
pretty
japanese
is
it
seen
through
a
fog
i
went
to
an
auction
yesterday
and
do
you
know
i
bought
a
with
a
picture
just
like
madeleine
inquired
with
extreme
interest
about
the
auction
but
after
learning
all
that
baker
had
to
tell
she
was
on
the
point
of
being
reduced
to
silence
when
she
bethought
herself
to
mention
carrington
baker
brightened
up
at
once
if
she
could
be
said
to
brighten
where
there
was
no
sign
of
dimness
dear
carrington
is
he
sweet
i
think
he
a
delicious
man
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
him
since
poor
baker
left
me
we
have
been
together
all
the
time
you
know
my
poor
husband
left
directions
that
all
his
papers
should
be
burned
and
though
i
would
not
say
so
unless
you
were
such
a
friend
of
carrington
i
reckon
just
as
well
for
some
people
that
he
did
i
never
could
tell
you
what
quantities
of
papers
carrington
and
i
have
put
in
the
fire
and
we
read
them
all
madeleine
asked
whether
this
was
not
dull
work
oh
dear
no
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
and
told
carrington
the
story
of
every
paper
as
we
went
on
it
was
quite
amusing
i
assure
lee
then
boldly
said
she
had
got
from
carrington
an
idea
that
baker
was
a
very
skilful
diplomatist
diplomatist
echoed
the
widow
with
her
genial
laugh
well
it
was
as
much
that
as
anything
but
there
not
many
diplomatists
wives
in
this
city
ever
did
as
much
work
as
i
used
to
do
why
i
knew
half
the
members
of
congress
intimately
and
all
of
them
by
sight
i
knew
where
they
came
from
and
what
they
liked
best
i
could
get
round
the
greater
part
of
them
sooner
or
lee
asked
what
she
did
with
all
this
knowledge
baker
shook
her
countenance
and
almost
paralysed
her
opposite
neighbour
by
a
sort
of
grande
duchesse
wink
oh
my
dear
you
are
new
here
if
you
had
seen
washington
in
and
for
a
few
years
afterwards
you
would
ask
that
we
had
more
congressional
business
than
all
the
other
agents
put
together
every
one
came
to
us
then
to
get
his
bill
through
or
his
appropriation
watched
we
were
hard
at
work
all
the
time
you
see
one
ca
keep
the
run
of
three
hundred
men
without
some
trouble
my
husband
used
to
make
lists
of
them
in
books
with
a
history
of
each
man
and
all
he
could
learn
about
him
but
i
carried
it
all
in
my
do
you
mean
that
you
could
get
them
all
to
vote
as
you
pleased
asked
madeleine
well
we
got
our
bills
through
replied
baker
but
how
did
you
do
it
did
they
take
bribes
some
of
them
did
some
of
them
liked
suppers
and
cards
and
theatres
and
all
sorts
of
things
some
of
them
could
be
led
and
some
had
to
be
driven
like
paddy
pig
who
thought
he
was
going
the
other
way
some
of
them
had
wives
who
could
talk
to
them
and
some
had
said
baker
with
a
queer
intonation
in
her
abrupt
ending
but
surely
said
lee
many
of
them
must
have
been
above
i
mean
they
must
have
had
nothing
to
get
hold
of
so
that
you
could
manage
baker
laughed
cheerfully
and
remarked
that
they
were
very
much
of
a
muchness
but
i
ca
understand
how
you
did
it
urged
madeleine
now
how
would
you
have
gone
to
work
to
get
a
respectable
senator
vote
a
man
like
ratcliffe
for
instance
ratcliffe
repeated
baker
with
a
slight
elevation
of
voice
that
gave
way
to
a
patronising
laugh
oh
my
dear
do
mention
names
i
should
get
into
trouble
senator
ratcliffe
was
a
good
friend
of
my
husband
i
guess
carrington
could
have
told
you
that
but
you
see
what
we
generally
wanted
was
all
right
enough
we
had
to
know
where
our
bills
were
and
jog
people
elbows
to
get
them
reported
in
time
sometimes
we
had
to
convince
them
that
our
bill
was
a
proper
one
and
they
ought
to
vote
for
it
only
now
and
then
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
money
and
the
vote
was
close
we
had
to
find
out
what
votes
were
worth
it
was
mostly
dining
and
talking
calling
them
out
into
the
lobby
or
asking
them
to
supper
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
things
i
have
seen
but
i
do
dare
it
would
be
safe
i
told
you
already
more
than
i
ever
said
to
any
one
else
but
then
you
are
so
intimate
with
carrington
that
i
always
think
of
you
as
an
old
thus
baker
rippled
on
while
lee
listened
with
more
and
more
doubt
and
disgust
the
woman
was
showy
handsome
in
a
coarse
style
and
perfectly
presentable
lee
had
seen
duchesses
as
vulgar
she
knew
more
about
the
practical
working
of
government
than
lee
could
ever
expect
or
hope
to
know
why
then
draw
back
from
this
interesting
lobbyist
with
such
babyish
repulsion
when
after
a
long
and
as
she
declared
a
most
charming
call
baker
wended
her
way
elsewhere
and
madeleine
had
given
the
strictest
order
that
she
should
never
be
admitted
again
carrington
entered
and
madeleine
showed
him
baker
card
and
gave
a
lively
account
of
the
interview
what
shall
i
do
with
the
woman
she
asked
must
i
return
her
card
but
carrington
declined
to
offer
advice
on
this
interesting
point
and
she
says
that
ratcliffe
was
a
friend
of
her
husband
and
that
you
could
tell
me
about
did
she
say
so
remarked
carrington
vaguely
yes
and
that
she
knew
every
one
weak
points
and
could
get
all
their
carrington
expressed
no
surprise
and
so
evidently
preferred
to
change
the
subject
that
lee
desisted
and
said
no
more
but
she
determined
to
try
the
same
experiment
on
ratcliffe
and
chose
the
very
next
chance
that
offered
in
her
most
indifferent
manner
she
remarked
that
sam
baker
had
called
upon
her
and
had
initiated
her
into
the
mysteries
of
the
lobby
till
she
had
become
quite
ambitious
to
start
on
that
career
she
said
you
were
a
friend
of
her
husband
added
madeleine
softly
ratcliffe
face
betrayed
no
sign
if
you
believe
what
those
people
tell
you
said
he
drily
you
will
be
wiser
than
the
queen
of
chapter
ix
whenever
a
man
reaches
the
top
of
the
political
ladder
his
enemies
unite
to
pull
him
down
his
friends
become
critical
and
exacting
among
the
many
dangers
of
this
sort
which
now
threatened
ratcliffe
there
was
one
that
had
he
known
it
might
have
made
him
more
uneasy
than
any
of
those
which
were
the
work
of
senators
and
congressmen
carrington
entered
into
an
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
with
sybil
it
came
about
in
this
wise
sybil
was
fond
of
riding
and
occasionally
when
carrington
could
spare
the
time
he
went
as
her
guide
and
protector
in
these
country
excursions
for
every
virginian
however
out
at
elbows
has
a
horse
as
he
has
shoes
or
a
shirt
in
a
thoughtless
moment
carrington
had
been
drawn
into
a
promise
that
he
would
take
sybil
to
arlington
the
promise
was
one
that
he
did
not
hurry
to
keep
for
there
were
reasons
which
made
a
visit
to
arlington
anything
but
a
pleasure
to
him
but
sybil
would
listen
to
no
excuses
and
so
it
came
about
that
one
lovely
march
morning
when
the
shrubs
and
the
trees
in
the
square
before
the
house
were
just
beginning
under
the
warmer
sun
to
show
signs
of
their
coming
wantonness
sybil
stood
at
the
open
window
waiting
for
him
while
her
new
kentucky
horse
before
the
door
showed
what
he
thought
of
the
delay
by
curving
his
neck
tossing
his
head
and
pawing
the
pavement
carrington
was
late
and
kept
her
waiting
so
long
that
the
mignonette
and
geraniums
which
adorned
the
window
suffered
for
his
slowness
and
the
curtain
tassels
showed
signs
of
wilful
damage
nevertheless
he
arrived
at
length
and
they
set
out
together
choosing
the
streets
least
enlivened
by
and
until
they
had
crept
through
the
great
metropolis
of
georgetown
and
come
upon
the
bridge
which
crosses
the
noble
river
just
where
its
bold
banks
open
out
to
clasp
the
city
of
washington
in
their
easy
embrace
then
reaching
the
virginia
side
they
cantered
gaily
up
the
road
with
glimpses
of
woody
defiles
each
carrying
its
trickling
stream
and
rich
in
promise
of
summer
flowers
while
from
point
to
point
they
caught
glorious
glimpses
of
the
distant
city
and
river
they
passed
the
small
military
station
on
the
heights
still
dignified
by
the
name
of
fort
though
sybil
silently
wondered
how
a
fort
was
possible
without
fortifications
and
complained
that
there
was
nothing
more
warlike
than
a
nursery
of
telegraph
the
day
was
blue
and
gold
everything
smiled
and
sparkled
in
the
crisp
freshness
of
the
morning
sybil
was
in
bounding
spirits
and
not
at
all
pleased
to
find
that
her
companion
became
moody
and
abstracted
as
they
went
on
poor
carrington
thought
she
to
herself
he
is
so
nice
but
when
he
puts
on
that
solemn
air
one
might
as
well
go
to
sleep
i
am
quite
certain
no
nice
woman
will
ever
marry
him
if
he
looks
like
that
and
her
practical
mind
ran
off
among
all
the
girls
of
her
acquaintance
in
search
of
one
who
would
put
up
with
carrington
melancholy
face
she
knew
his
devotion
to
her
sister
but
had
long
ago
rejected
this
as
a
hopeless
chance
there
was
a
simplicity
about
sybil
way
of
dealing
with
life
which
had
its
own
charm
she
never
troubled
herself
about
the
impossible
or
the
unthinkable
she
had
feelings
and
was
rather
quick
in
her
sympathies
and
sorrows
but
she
was
equally
quick
in
getting
over
them
and
she
expected
other
people
to
do
likewise
madeleine
dissected
her
own
feelings
and
was
always
wondering
whether
they
were
real
or
not
she
had
a
habit
of
taking
off
her
mental
clothing
as
she
might
take
off
a
dress
and
looking
at
it
as
though
it
belonged
to
some
one
else
and
as
though
sensations
were
manufactured
like
clothes
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
easier
ways
of
deadening
sorrow
as
though
the
mind
could
teach
itself
to
lop
off
its
feelers
sybil
particularly
disliked
this
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
understand
it
and
in
the
second
her
mind
was
all
feelers
and
amputation
was
death
she
could
no
more
analyse
a
feeling
than
doubt
its
existence
both
which
were
habits
of
her
sister
how
was
sybil
to
know
what
was
passing
in
carrington
mind
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
in
which
she
supposed
herself
interested
he
was
troubled
with
memories
of
civil
war
and
of
associations
still
earlier
belonging
to
an
age
already
vanishing
or
vanished
but
what
could
she
know
about
civil
war
who
had
been
almost
an
infant
at
the
time
at
this
moment
she
happened
to
be
interested
in
the
baffle
of
waterloo
for
she
was
reading
vanity
fair
and
had
cried
as
she
ought
for
poor
little
emmy
when
her
husband
george
osborne
lay
dead
on
the
field
there
with
a
bullet
through
his
heart
but
how
was
she
to
know
that
here
only
a
few
rods
before
her
lay
scores
and
hundreds
of
george
osbornes
or
his
betters
and
in
their
graves
the
love
and
hope
of
many
emmys
not
creatures
of
the
imagination
but
flesh
and
blood
like
herself
to
her
there
was
no
more
in
those
associations
which
made
carrington
groan
in
the
silence
of
his
thoughts
than
if
he
had
been
old
kaspar
and
she
the
little
wilhelmine
what
was
a
skull
more
or
less
to
her
what
concern
had
she
in
the
famous
victory
yet
even
sybil
was
startled
as
she
rode
through
the
gate
and
found
herself
suddenly
met
by
the
long
white
ranks
of
stretching
up
and
down
the
by
thousands
in
order
of
baffle
as
though
cadmus
had
reversed
his
myth
and
had
sown
living
men
to
come
up
dragons
teeth
she
drew
in
her
horse
with
a
shiver
and
a
sudden
impulse
to
cry
here
was
something
new
to
her
this
was
war
wounds
disease
death
she
dropped
her
voice
and
with
a
look
almost
as
serious
as
carrington
asked
what
all
these
graves
meant
when
carrington
told
her
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
catch
some
dim
notion
why
his
face
was
not
quite
as
gay
as
her
own
even
now
this
idea
was
not
very
precise
for
he
said
little
about
himself
but
at
least
she
grappled
with
the
fact
that
he
had
actually
year
after
year
carried
arms
against
these
men
who
lay
at
her
feet
and
who
had
given
their
lives
for
her
cause
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
as
a
new
thought
that
perhaps
he
himself
might
have
killed
one
of
them
with
his
own
hand
there
was
a
strange
shock
in
this
idea
she
felt
that
carrington
was
further
from
her
he
gained
dignity
in
his
rebel
isolation
she
wanted
to
ask
him
how
he
could
have
been
a
traitor
and
she
did
not
dare
carrington
a
traitor
carrington
killing
her
friends
the
idea
was
too
large
to
grasp
she
fell
back
on
the
simpler
task
of
wondering
how
he
had
looked
in
his
rebel
uniform
they
rode
slowly
round
to
the
door
of
the
house
and
dismounted
after
he
had
with
some
difficulty
found
a
man
to
hold
their
horses
from
the
heavy
brick
porch
they
looked
across
the
superb
river
to
the
raw
and
incoherent
ugliness
of
the
city
idealised
into
dreamy
beauty
by
the
atmosphere
and
the
soft
background
of
purple
hills
behind
opposite
them
with
its
crude
thus
saith
the
law
stamped
on
white
dome
and
walls
rose
the
capitol
carrington
stood
with
her
a
short
time
while
they
looked
at
the
view
then
said
he
would
rather
not
go
into
the
house
himself
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
while
she
strolled
alone
through
the
rooms
these
were
bare
and
gaunt
so
that
she
with
her
feminine
sense
of
fitness
of
course
considered
what
she
would
do
to
make
them
habitable
she
had
a
neat
fancy
for
furniture
and
distributed
her
tones
and
half
tones
and
bits
of
colour
freely
about
the
walls
and
ceilings
with
a
chair
here
a
sofa
there
and
a
table
in
the
centre
until
her
eye
was
caught
by
a
very
dirty
deal
desk
on
which
stood
an
open
book
with
an
inkstand
and
some
pens
on
the
leaf
she
read
the
last
entry
eli
grow
and
lady
thermopyle
not
even
the
graves
outside
had
brought
the
horrors
of
war
so
near
what
a
scourge
it
was
this
respectable
family
turned
out
of
such
a
lovely
house
and
all
the
pretty
old
furniture
swept
away
before
a
horde
of
coarse
invaders
with
did
the
hosts
of
attila
write
their
names
on
visiting
books
in
the
temple
of
vesta
and
the
house
of
sallust
what
a
new
terror
they
would
have
added
to
the
name
of
the
scourge
of
god
sybil
returned
to
the
portico
and
sat
down
by
carrington
on
the
steps
how
awfully
sad
it
is
said
she
i
suppose
the
house
was
prettily
furnished
when
the
lees
lived
here
did
you
ever
see
it
then
sybil
was
not
very
profound
but
she
had
sympathy
and
at
this
moment
carrington
felt
sorely
in
need
of
comfort
he
wanted
some
one
to
share
his
feelings
and
he
turned
towards
her
hungry
for
companionship
the
lees
were
old
family
friends
of
mine
said
he
i
used
to
stay
here
when
i
was
a
boy
even
as
late
as
the
spring
of
the
last
time
i
sat
here
it
was
with
them
we
were
wild
about
disunion
and
talked
of
nothing
else
i
have
been
trying
to
recall
what
was
said
then
we
never
thought
there
would
be
war
and
as
for
coercion
it
was
nonsense
coercion
indeed
the
idea
was
ridiculous
i
thought
so
too
though
i
was
a
union
man
and
did
not
want
the
state
to
go
out
but
though
i
felt
sure
that
virginia
must
suffer
i
never
thought
we
could
be
beaten
yet
now
i
am
sitting
here
a
pardoned
rebel
and
the
poor
lees
are
driven
away
and
their
place
is
a
sybil
became
at
once
absorbed
in
the
lees
and
asked
many
questions
all
which
carrington
gladly
answered
he
told
her
how
he
had
admired
and
followed
general
lee
through
the
war
we
thought
he
was
to
be
our
washington
you
know
and
perhaps
he
had
some
such
idea
himself
and
then
when
sybil
wanted
to
hear
about
the
baffles
and
the
fighting
he
drew
a
rough
map
on
the
gravel
path
to
show
her
how
the
two
lines
had
run
only
a
few
miles
away
then
he
told
her
how
he
had
carried
his
musket
day
after
day
over
all
this
country
and
where
he
had
seen
his
battles
sybil
had
everything
to
learn
the
story
came
to
her
with
all
the
animation
of
real
life
for
here
under
her
eyes
were
the
graves
of
her
own
champions
and
by
her
side
was
a
rebel
who
had
stood
under
our
fire
at
malvern
hill
and
at
south
mountain
and
who
was
telling
her
how
men
looked
and
what
they
thought
in
face
of
death
she
listened
with
breathless
interest
and
at
last
summoned
courage
to
ask
in
an
awestruck
tone
whether
carrington
had
ever
killed
any
one
himself
she
was
relieved
although
a
little
disappointed
when
he
said
that
he
believed
not
he
hoped
not
though
no
private
who
has
discharged
a
musket
in
baffle
can
be
quite
sure
where
the
bullet
went
i
never
tried
to
kill
any
one
said
he
though
they
tried
to
kill
me
then
sybil
begged
to
know
how
they
had
tried
to
kill
him
and
he
told
her
one
or
two
of
those
experiences
such
as
most
soldiers
have
had
when
he
had
been
fired
upon
and
the
balls
had
torn
his
clothes
or
drawn
blood
poor
sybil
was
quite
overcome
and
found
a
deadly
fascination
in
the
horror
as
they
sat
together
on
the
steps
with
the
glorious
view
spread
before
them
her
attention
was
so
closely
fixed
on
his
story
that
she
saw
neither
the
view
nor
even
the
carriages
of
tourists
who
drove
up
looked
about
and
departed
envying
carrington
his
occupation
with
the
lovely
girl
she
was
in
imagination
rushing
with
him
down
the
valley
of
virginia
on
the
heels
of
our
flying
army
or
gloomily
toiling
back
to
the
potomac
after
the
bloody
days
at
gettysburg
or
watching
the
last
grand
debâcle
on
the
road
from
richmond
to
appomattox
they
would
have
sat
there
till
sunset
if
carrington
had
not
at
length
insisted
that
they
must
go
and
then
she
rose
slowly
with
a
deep
sigh
and
undisguised
regret
as
they
rode
away
carrington
whose
thoughts
were
not
devoted
to
his
companion
so
entirely
as
they
should
have
been
ventured
to
say
that
he
wished
her
sister
had
come
with
them
but
he
found
that
his
hint
was
not
well
received
sybil
emphatically
rejected
the
idea
i
very
glad
she
did
come
if
she
had
you
would
have
talked
with
her
all
the
time
and
i
should
have
been
left
to
amuse
myself
you
would
have
been
discussing
things
and
i
hate
discussions
she
would
have
been
hunting
for
first
principles
and
you
would
have
been
running
about
trying
to
catch
some
for
her
besides
she
is
coming
herself
some
sunday
with
that
tiresome
ratcliffe
i
do
see
what
she
finds
in
that
man
to
amuse
her
her
taste
is
getting
to
be
demoralised
in
washington
do
you
know
carrington
i
not
clever
or
serious
like
madeleine
and
i
ca
read
laws
and
hate
politics
but
i
more
common
sense
than
she
has
and
she
makes
me
cross
with
her
i
understand
now
why
young
widows
are
dangerous
and
why
they
bumed
at
their
husband
funerals
in
india
not
that
i
want
to
have
madeleine
burned
for
she
a
dear
good
creature
and
i
love
her
better
than
anything
in
the
world
but
she
will
certainly
do
herself
some
dreadful
mischief
one
of
these
days
she
has
the
most
extravagant
notions
about
and
duty
if
she
had
luckily
thought
of
taking
charge
of
me
she
would
have
done
some
awful
thing
long
ago
and
if
i
could
only
be
a
little
wicked
she
would
be
quite
happy
all
the
rest
of
her
life
in
reforming
me
but
now
she
has
got
hold
of
that
ratcliffe
and
he
is
trying
to
make
her
think
she
can
reform
him
and
if
he
does
it
all
up
with
us
madeleine
will
just
go
and
break
her
heart
over
that
odious
great
coarse
brute
who
only
wants
her
sybil
delivered
this
little
oration
with
a
degree
of
energy
that
went
to
carrington
heart
she
did
not
often
make
such
sustained
efforts
and
it
was
clear
that
on
this
subject
she
had
exhausted
her
whole
mind
carrington
was
delighted
and
urged
her
on
i
dislike
ratcliffe
as
much
as
you
do
more
perhaps
so
does
every
one
who
knows
much
about
him
but
we
shall
only
make
the
matter
worse
if
we
interfere
what
can
we
do
that
is
just
what
i
tell
everybody
resumed
sybil
there
is
victoria
dare
always
telling
me
i
ought
to
do
something
and
schneidekoupon
too
just
as
though
i
could
do
anything
madeleine
has
done
nothing
but
get
into
mischief
here
half
the
people
think
her
worldly
and
ambitious
only
last
night
that
spiteful
old
woman
clinton
said
to
me
sister
is
quite
spoiled
by
washington
she
is
more
wild
for
power
than
any
human
being
i
ever
saw
i
was
dreadfully
angry
and
told
her
she
was
quite
mistaken
madeleine
was
not
the
least
spoiled
but
i
say
that
she
was
not
fond
of
power
for
she
is
but
not
in
the
way
clinton
meant
you
should
have
seen
her
the
other
evening
when
ratcliffe
said
about
some
matter
of
public
business
that
he
would
do
whatever
she
thought
right
she
spoke
up
quite
sharply
for
her
with
a
scornful
little
laugh
and
said
that
he
had
better
do
what
he
thought
right
he
looked
for
a
moment
almost
angry
and
muttered
something
about
women
being
incomprehensible
he
is
always
trying
to
tempt
her
with
power
she
might
have
had
long
ago
all
the
power
he
could
give
her
but
i
can
see
and
he
sees
too
that
she
always
keeps
him
at
arm
length
he
does
like
it
but
he
expects
one
of
these
days
to
find
a
bribe
that
will
answer
i
wish
we
had
never
come
to
washington
new
york
is
so
much
nicer
and
the
people
there
are
much
more
amusing
they
dance
ever
so
much
better
and
send
one
flowers
all
the
time
and
then
they
never
talk
about
first
principles
maude
had
her
hospitals
and
paupers
and
training
school
and
got
along
very
well
it
was
so
safe
but
when
i
say
so
to
her
she
only
smiles
in
a
patronising
kind
of
way
and
tells
me
that
i
shall
have
as
much
of
newport
as
i
want
just
as
though
i
were
a
child
and
not
a
woman
of
poor
maude
i
ca
stay
with
her
if
she
marries
ratcliffe
and
it
would
break
my
heart
to
leave
her
with
that
man
do
you
think
he
would
beat
her
does
he
drink
i
would
almost
rather
be
beaten
a
little
if
i
cared
for
a
man
than
be
taken
out
to
peonia
oh
carrington
you
are
our
only
hope
she
will
listen
to
you
do
let
her
marry
that
dreadful
to
all
this
pathetic
appeal
some
parts
of
which
were
as
little
calculated
to
please
carrington
as
ratcliffe
himself
carrington
answered
that
he
was
ready
to
do
all
in
his
power
but
that
sybil
must
tell
him
when
and
how
to
act
then
it
a
bargain
said
she
whenever
i
want
you
i
shall
call
on
you
for
help
and
you
shall
prevent
the
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
said
he
laughing
war
to
the
knife
on
ratcliffe
we
will
have
his
scalp
if
necessary
but
i
rather
think
he
will
soon
commit
himself
if
we
leave
him
madeleine
will
like
him
all
the
better
if
he
does
anything
japanese
replied
sybil
with
great
seriousness
i
wish
there
was
more
japanese
here
or
any
kind
of
old
pots
and
pans
to
talk
about
a
little
art
would
be
good
for
her
what
a
strange
place
this
is
and
how
people
do
stand
on
their
heads
in
it
nobody
thinks
like
anyone
else
victoria
dare
says
she
is
trying
on
principle
not
to
be
good
because
she
wants
to
keep
some
new
excitements
for
the
next
world
i
sure
she
practices
as
she
preaches
did
you
see
her
at
clinton
last
night
she
behaved
more
outrageously
than
ever
she
sat
on
the
stairs
all
through
supper
looking
like
a
demure
yellow
cat
with
two
bouquets
in
her
paws
and
i
know
lord
dunbeg
sent
one
of
them
and
she
actually
let
french
feed
her
with
from
a
spoon
she
says
she
was
showing
lord
dunbeg
a
phase
and
that
he
is
going
to
put
it
into
his
article
on
american
manners
and
customs
in
the
quarterly
but
i
think
it
nice
do
you
carrington
i
wish
madeleine
had
her
to
take
care
of
she
would
have
enough
to
do
then
i
can
tell
and
so
gently
prattling
miss
sybil
returned
to
the
city
her
alliance
with
carrington
completed
and
it
was
a
singular
fact
that
she
never
again
called
him
dull
there
was
henceforward
a
look
of
more
positive
pleasure
and
cordiality
on
her
face
when
he
made
his
appearance
wherever
she
might
be
and
the
next
time
he
suggested
a
horseback
excursion
she
instantly
agreed
to
go
although
aware
that
she
had
promised
a
younger
gentleman
of
the
diplomatic
body
to
be
at
home
that
same
afternoon
and
the
good
fellow
swore
polyglot
oaths
on
being
turned
away
from
her
door
ratcliffe
knew
nothing
of
this
conspiracy
against
his
peace
and
prospects
even
if
he
had
known
it
he
might
only
have
laughed
and
pursued
his
own
path
without
a
second
thought
yet
it
was
certain
that
he
did
not
think
carrington
enmity
a
thing
to
be
overlooked
and
from
the
moment
of
his
obtaining
a
clue
to
its
cause
he
had
begun
to
take
precautions
against
it
even
in
the
middle
of
the
contest
for
the
treasury
he
had
found
time
to
listen
to
wilson
keens
report
on
the
affairs
of
the
late
samuel
baker
mr
keen
came
to
him
with
a
copy
of
baker
will
and
with
memoranda
of
remarks
made
by
the
unsuspecting
baker
from
which
it
appears
said
he
that
baker
having
no
time
to
put
his
affairs
in
order
left
special
directions
that
his
executors
should
carefully
destroy
all
papers
that
might
be
likely
to
compromise
what
is
the
executor
name
interrupted
ratcliffe
the
executor
name
is
john
carrington
said
keen
methodically
referring
to
his
copy
of
the
will
ratcliffe
face
was
impassive
but
the
inevitable
i
knew
it
almost
sprang
to
his
lips
he
was
rather
pleased
at
the
instinct
which
had
led
him
so
directly
to
the
right
trail
keen
went
on
to
say
that
from
baker
conversation
it
was
certain
that
the
testator
directions
had
been
carried
out
and
that
the
great
bulk
of
these
papers
had
been
burned
then
it
will
be
useless
to
press
the
inquiry
further
said
ratcliffe
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
assistance
and
he
turned
the
conversation
to
the
condition
of
mr
keen
bureau
in
the
treasury
department
the
next
time
ratcliffe
saw
lee
after
his
appointment
to
the
treasury
was
confirmed
he
asked
her
whether
she
did
not
think
carrington
very
well
suited
for
public
service
and
when
she
warmly
assented
he
said
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
offer
the
place
of
solicitor
of
the
treasury
to
carrington
for
although
the
actual
salary
might
not
be
very
much
more
than
he
earned
by
his
private
practice
the
incidental
advantages
to
a
washington
lawyer
were
considerable
and
to
the
secretary
it
was
especially
necessary
to
have
a
solicitor
in
whom
he
could
place
entire
confidence
lee
was
pleased
by
this
motion
of
ratcliffe
the
more
because
she
had
supposed
that
ratcliffe
had
no
liking
for
carrington
she
doubted
whether
carrington
would
accept
the
place
but
she
hoped
that
it
might
modify
his
dislike
for
ratcliffe
and
she
agreed
to
sound
him
on
the
subject
there
was
something
a
little
compromising
in
thus
allowing
herself
to
appear
as
the
dispenser
of
patronage
but
she
dismissed
this
objection
on
the
ground
that
carrington
interests
were
involved
and
that
it
was
for
him
to
judge
whether
he
should
take
the
place
or
not
perhaps
the
world
would
not
be
so
charitable
if
the
appointment
were
made
what
then
lee
asked
herself
the
question
and
did
not
feel
quite
at
ease
so
far
as
carrington
was
concerned
she
might
have
dismissed
her
doubts
there
was
not
a
chance
of
his
taking
the
place
as
very
soon
appeared
when
she
spoke
to
him
on
the
subject
and
repeated
what
ratcliffe
had
said
his
face
flushed
and
he
sat
for
some
moments
in
silence
he
never
thought
very
rapidly
but
now
the
ideas
seemed
to
come
so
fast
as
to
bewilder
his
mind
the
situation
flashed
before
his
eyes
like
electric
sparks
his
first
impression
was
that
ratcliffe
wanted
to
buy
him
to
tie
his
tongue
to
make
him
run
like
a
fastened
dog
under
the
waggon
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
his
second
notion
was
that
ratcliffe
wanted
to
put
lee
under
obligations
in
order
to
win
her
regard
and
again
that
he
wanted
to
raise
himself
in
her
esteem
by
posing
as
a
friend
of
honest
administration
and
unassisted
virtue
then
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
scheme
was
to
make
him
appear
jealous
and
vindictive
to
put
him
in
an
attitude
where
any
reason
he
might
give
for
declining
would
bear
a
look
of
meanness
and
tend
to
separate
him
from
lee
carrington
was
so
absorbed
by
these
thoughts
and
his
mind
worked
so
slowly
that
he
failed
to
hear
one
or
two
remarks
addressed
to
him
by
lee
who
became
a
little
alarmed
under
the
impression
that
he
was
unexpectedly
paralyzed
when
at
length
he
heard
her
and
attempted
to
frame
an
answer
his
embarrassment
increased
he
could
only
stammer
that
he
was
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
decline
but
this
office
was
one
he
could
not
undertake
if
madeleine
felt
a
little
relieved
by
this
decision
she
did
not
show
it
from
her
manner
one
might
have
supposed
it
to
be
her
fondest
wish
that
carrington
should
be
solicitor
of
the
treasury
she
him
with
obstinacy
was
not
the
offer
a
good
one
and
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
it
was
were
the
duties
such
as
he
could
not
perform
not
at
all
there
was
nothing
in
the
duties
which
alarmed
him
did
he
object
to
it
because
of
his
southern
prejudices
against
the
administration
oh
no
he
had
no
political
feeling
to
stand
in
his
way
what
then
could
be
his
reason
for
refusing
carrington
resorted
again
to
silence
until
lee
a
little
impatiently
asked
whether
it
was
possible
that
his
personal
dislike
to
racliffe
could
blind
him
so
far
as
to
make
him
reject
so
fair
a
proposal
carrington
finding
himself
more
and
more
uncomfortable
rose
restlessly
from
his
chair
and
paced
the
room
he
felt
that
ratclife
had
fairly
him
and
he
was
at
his
wits
end
to
know
what
card
he
could
play
that
would
not
lead
directly
into
ratcliffe
trump
suit
to
refuse
such
an
offer
was
hard
enough
at
best
for
a
man
who
wanted
money
and
professional
advancement
as
he
did
but
to
injure
himself
and
help
ratcliffe
by
this
refusal
was
abominably
hard
nevertheless
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
he
would
rather
not
take
a
position
so
directly
under
ratcliffe
control
madeleine
said
no
more
but
he
thought
she
looked
annoyed
and
he
felt
himself
in
an
intolerably
painful
situation
he
was
not
certain
that
she
herself
might
not
have
had
some
share
in
proposing
the
plan
and
that
his
refusal
might
not
have
some
mortifying
consequences
for
her
what
must
she
think
of
him
then
at
this
very
moment
he
would
have
given
his
right
arm
for
a
word
of
real
affection
from
lee
he
adored
her
he
would
willingly
enough
have
damned
himself
for
her
there
was
no
sacrifice
he
would
not
have
made
to
bring
her
nearer
to
him
in
his
upright
quiet
simple
kind
of
way
he
immolated
himself
before
her
for
months
his
heart
had
ached
with
this
hopeless
passion
he
recognized
that
it
was
hopeless
he
knew
that
she
would
never
love
him
and
to
do
her
justice
she
never
had
given
him
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
in
her
power
to
love
him
r
any
man
and
here
he
stood
obliged
to
appear
ungrateful
and
prejudiced
mean
and
vindictive
in
her
eyes
he
took
his
seat
again
looking
so
unutterably
dejected
his
patient
face
so
tragically
mournful
that
madeleine
after
a
while
began
to
see
the
absurd
side
of
the
matter
and
presently
burst
into
a
laugh
please
do
not
look
so
frightfully
miserable
said
she
i
did
not
mean
to
make
you
unhappy
after
all
what
does
it
matter
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
refuse
and
for
my
part
i
have
not
the
least
wish
to
see
you
on
this
carrington
brightened
and
declared
that
if
she
thought
him
right
in
declining
he
cared
for
nothing
else
it
was
only
the
idea
of
hurting
her
feelings
that
weighed
on
his
mind
but
in
saying
this
he
spoke
in
a
tone
that
implied
a
deeper
feeling
and
made
lee
again
look
grave
and
sigh
ah
carrington
she
said
this
world
will
not
run
as
we
want
do
you
suppose
the
time
will
ever
come
when
every
one
will
be
good
and
happy
and
do
just
what
they
ought
i
thought
this
offer
might
possibly
take
one
anxiety
off
your
shoulders
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
let
myself
be
led
into
making
carrington
could
not
answer
her
he
dared
not
trust
his
voice
he
rose
to
go
and
as
she
held
out
her
hand
he
suddenly
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
so
left
her
she
sat
for
a
moment
with
tears
in
her
eyes
after
he
was
gone
she
thought
she
knew
all
that
was
in
his
mind
and
with
a
woman
readiness
to
explain
every
act
of
men
by
their
consuming
passions
for
her
own
sex
she
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
jealousy
was
the
whole
cause
of
carrington
hostility
to
ratcliffe
and
she
pardoned
it
with
charming
alacrity
ten
years
ago
i
could
have
loved
him
she
thought
to
herself
and
then
while
she
was
half
smiling
at
the
idea
suddenly
another
thought
flashed
upon
her
and
she
threw
her
hand
up
before
her
face
as
though
some
one
had
struck
her
a
blow
carrington
had
reopened
the
old
wound
when
ratcliffe
came
to
see
her
again
which
he
did
very
shortly
afterwards
glad
of
so
good
an
excuse
she
told
him
of
refusal
adding
only
that
he
seemed
unwilling
to
accept
any
position
that
had
a
political
character
ratcliffe
showed
no
sign
of
displeasure
he
only
said
in
a
benignant
tone
that
he
was
sorry
to
be
unable
to
do
something
for
so
good
a
friend
of
hers
thus
establishing
at
all
events
his
claim
on
her
gratitude
as
for
carrington
the
offer
which
ratcliffe
had
made
was
not
intended
to
be
accepted
and
carrington
could
not
have
more
embarrassed
the
secretary
than
by
closing
with
it
ratcliffe
object
had
been
to
settle
for
his
own
satisfaction
the
question
of
carrington
hostility
for
he
knew
the
man
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
in
any
event
he
would
act
a
perfectly
straightforward
part
if
he
accepted
he
would
at
least
be
true
to
his
chief
if
he
refused
as
ratcliffe
expected
it
would
be
a
proof
that
some
means
must
be
found
of
getting
him
out
of
the
way
in
any
case
the
offer
was
a
new
thread
in
the
net
that
ratcliffe
flattered
himself
he
was
rapidly
winding
about
the
affections
and
ambitions
of
lee
yet
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
thinking
that
carrington
more
easily
than
any
other
man
could
cut
the
meshes
of
this
net
if
he
chose
to
do
so
and
therefore
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
postpone
action
until
carrington
were
disposed
of
without
a
moment
delay
he
made
inquiries
as
to
all
the
vacant
or
eligible
offices
in
the
gift
of
the
government
outside
his
own
department
very
few
of
these
would
answer
his
purpose
he
wanted
some
temporary
law
business
that
would
for
a
time
take
its
holder
away
to
a
distance
say
to
australia
or
central
asia
the
further
the
better
it
must
be
highly
paid
and
it
must
be
given
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
excite
suspicion
that
ratcliffe
was
concerned
in
the
matter
such
an
office
was
not
easily
found
there
is
little
law
business
in
central
asia
and
at
this
moment
there
was
not
enough
to
require
a
special
agent
in
australia
carrington
could
hardly
be
induced
to
lead
an
expedition
to
the
sources
of
the
nile
in
search
of
business
merely
to
please
ratcliffe
nor
could
the
state
department
offer
encouragement
to
a
hope
that
government
would
pay
the
expenses
of
such
an
expedition
the
best
that
ratcliffe
could
do
was
to
select
the
place
of
counsel
to
the
mexican
which
was
soon
to
meet
in
the
city
of
mexico
and
which
would
require
about
six
months
absence
by
a
little
management
he
could
contrive
to
get
the
counsel
sent
away
in
advance
of
the
commission
in
order
to
work
up
a
part
of
the
case
on
the
spot
ratcliffe
acknowledged
that
mexico
was
too
near
but
he
drily
remarked
to
himself
that
if
carrington
could
get
back
in
time
to
dislodge
him
after
he
had
once
got
a
firm
hold
on
lee
he
would
never
try
to
run
another
caucus
the
point
once
settled
in
his
own
mind
ratcliffe
with
his
usual
rapidity
of
action
carried
his
scheme
into
effect
in
this
there
was
little
difficulty
he
dropped
in
at
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state
within
hours
after
his
last
conversation
with
lee
during
these
early
days
of
every
new
administration
the
absorbing
business
of
government
relates
principally
to
appointments
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
always
ready
to
oblige
his
colleagues
in
the
cabinet
by
taking
care
of
their
friends
to
any
reasonable
extent
the
secretary
of
state
was
not
less
courteous
the
moment
he
understood
that
ratcliffe
had
a
strong
wish
to
secure
the
appointment
of
a
certain
person
as
counsel
to
the
mexican
the
secretary
of
state
professed
readiness
to
gratify
him
and
when
he
heard
who
the
proposed
person
was
the
suggestion
was
hailed
with
pleasure
for
carrington
was
well
known
and
much
liked
at
the
department
and
was
indeed
an
excellent
man
for
the
place
ratcliffe
hardly
needed
to
promise
an
equivalent
the
business
was
arranged
in
ten
minutes
i
only
need
say
added
ratcliffe
that
if
my
agency
in
the
affair
is
known
carrington
will
certainly
refuse
the
place
for
he
is
one
of
your
virginia
planters
proud
as
lucifer
and
willing
to
accept
nothing
by
way
of
favour
i
will
speak
to
your
assistant
secretary
about
it
and
the
recommendation
shall
appear
to
come
from
the
very
next
day
carrington
received
a
private
note
from
his
old
friend
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
who
was
overjoyed
to
do
him
a
kindness
the
note
asked
him
to
call
at
the
department
at
his
earliest
convenience
he
went
and
the
assistant
secretary
announced
that
he
had
recommended
carrington
appointment
as
counsel
to
the
mexican
and
that
the
secretary
had
approved
the
recommendation
we
want
a
southern
man
a
lawyer
with
a
little
knowledge
of
international
law
one
who
can
go
at
once
and
above
all
an
honest
man
you
fit
the
description
to
a
hair
so
pack
your
trunk
as
soon
as
you
carrington
was
startled
coming
as
it
did
this
offer
was
not
only
unobjectionable
but
tempting
it
was
hard
for
him
even
to
imagine
a
reason
for
hesitation
from
the
first
he
felt
that
he
must
go
and
yet
to
go
was
the
very
last
thing
he
wanted
to
do
that
he
should
suspect
ratcliffe
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
scheme
of
banishment
was
a
matter
of
course
and
he
instantly
asked
whether
any
influence
had
been
used
in
his
favour
but
the
assistant
secretary
so
stoutly
averred
that
the
appointment
was
made
on
his
recommendation
alone
as
to
block
all
further
inquiry
technically
this
assertion
was
exact
and
it
made
carrington
feel
that
it
would
be
base
ingratitude
on
his
part
not
to
accept
a
favour
so
handsomely
offered
yet
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
acceptance
he
begged
four
and
twenty
hours
delay
in
order
as
he
said
to
see
whether
he
could
arrange
his
affairs
for
a
six
months
absence
although
he
knew
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
his
doing
so
he
went
away
and
sat
in
his
office
alone
gloomily
wondering
what
he
could
do
although
from
the
first
he
saw
that
the
situation
was
only
too
clear
and
there
could
not
be
the
least
dark
corner
of
a
doubt
to
crawl
into
six
months
ago
he
would
have
jumped
at
this
offer
what
had
happened
within
six
months
to
make
it
seem
a
disaster
lee
there
was
the
whole
story
to
go
away
now
was
to
give
up
lee
and
probably
to
give
her
up
to
ratcliffe
carrington
gnashed
his
teeth
when
he
thought
how
skilfully
ratcliffe
was
playing
his
cards
the
longer
he
reflected
the
more
certain
he
felt
that
ratcliffe
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
scheme
to
get
rid
of
him
and
yet
as
he
studied
the
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
after
all
it
was
possible
for
ratcliffe
to
make
a
blunder
this
illinois
politician
was
clever
and
understood
men
but
a
knowledge
of
men
is
a
very
different
thing
from
a
knowledge
of
women
carrington
himself
had
no
great
experience
in
the
article
of
women
but
he
thought
he
knew
more
than
ratcliffe
who
was
evidently
relying
most
on
his
usual
theory
of
political
corruption
as
applied
to
feminine
weaknesses
and
who
was
only
puzzled
at
finding
how
high
a
price
lee
set
on
herself
if
ratcliffe
were
really
at
the
bottom
of
the
scheme
for
separating
carrington
from
her
it
could
only
be
because
he
thought
that
six
months
or
even
six
weeks
would
be
enough
to
answer
his
purpose
and
on
reaching
this
point
in
his
reflections
carrington
suddenly
rose
lit
a
cigar
and
walked
up
and
down
his
room
steadily
for
the
next
hour
with
the
air
of
a
general
arranging
a
plan
of
campaign
or
a
lawyer
anticipating
his
line
of
argument
on
one
point
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
accept
if
ratcliffe
really
had
a
hand
in
this
move
he
should
be
gratified
if
he
had
laid
a
trap
he
should
be
caught
in
it
and
when
the
evening
came
carrington
took
his
hat
and
walked
off
to
call
upon
lee
he
found
the
sisters
alone
and
quietly
engaged
in
their
occupations
madeleine
was
dramatically
mending
an
silk
stocking
a
delicate
and
difficult
task
which
required
her
whole
mind
sybil
was
at
the
piano
as
usual
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
she
rose
when
he
came
in
and
taking
her
sat
down
to
share
in
the
conversation
she
meant
to
take
her
place
as
a
woman
henceforward
she
was
tired
of
playing
girl
carrington
should
see
that
she
was
not
a
fool
carrington
plunged
at
once
into
his
subject
and
announced
the
offer
made
to
him
at
which
madeleine
expressed
delight
and
asked
many
questions
what
was
the
pay
how
soon
must
he
go
how
long
should
he
be
away
was
there
danger
from
the
climate
and
finally
she
added
with
a
smile
what
am
i
to
say
to
ratcliffe
if
you
accept
this
offer
after
refusing
his
as
for
sybil
she
made
one
reproachful
exclamation
oh
carrington
and
sank
back
into
silence
and
consternation
her
first
experiment
at
taking
a
stand
of
her
own
in
the
world
was
not
encouraging
she
felt
betrayed
nor
was
carrington
gay
however
modest
a
man
may
be
only
an
idiot
can
forget
himself
entirely
in
pursuing
the
moon
and
the
stars
in
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
had
a
lingering
hope
that
when
he
told
his
story
madeleine
might
look
up
with
a
change
of
expression
a
glance
of
unpremeditated
regard
a
little
suffusion
of
the
eyes
a
little
trembling
of
the
voice
to
see
himself
relegated
to
mexico
with
such
cheerful
alacrity
by
the
woman
he
loved
was
not
the
experience
he
would
have
chosen
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
hopes
were
disposed
of
and
he
watched
her
with
a
painful
sinking
of
the
heart
which
did
not
lead
to
lightness
of
conversation
madeleine
herself
felt
that
her
expressions
needed
to
be
qualified
and
she
tried
to
correct
her
mistake
what
should
she
do
without
a
tutor
she
said
he
must
let
her
have
a
list
of
books
to
read
while
he
was
away
they
were
themselves
going
north
in
the
middle
of
may
and
carrington
would
be
back
by
the
time
they
returned
in
december
after
all
they
should
see
as
little
of
him
during
the
summer
if
he
were
in
virginia
as
if
he
were
in
mexico
carrington
gloomily
confessed
that
he
was
very
unwilling
to
go
that
he
wished
the
idea
had
never
been
suggested
that
he
should
be
perfectly
happy
if
for
any
reason
the
scheme
broke
down
but
he
gave
no
explanation
of
his
feeling
and
madeleine
had
too
much
tact
to
press
for
one
she
contented
herself
by
arguing
against
it
and
talking
as
vivaciously
as
she
could
her
heart
really
bled
for
him
as
she
saw
his
face
grow
more
and
more
pathetic
in
its
quiet
expression
of
disappointment
but
what
could
she
say
or
do
he
sat
till
after
ten
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
he
felt
that
this
was
the
end
of
his
pleasure
in
life
he
dreaded
the
solitude
of
his
thoughts
lee
resources
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
long
pauses
intervened
between
her
remarks
and
at
length
carrington
with
a
superhuman
effort
apologized
for
inflicting
himself
upon
her
so
unmercifully
if
she
knew
he
said
how
he
dreaded
being
alone
she
would
forgive
him
then
he
rose
to
go
and
in
taking
leave
asked
sybil
if
she
was
inclined
to
ride
the
next
day
if
so
he
was
at
her
service
sybil
face
brightened
as
she
accepted
the
invitation
lee
a
day
or
two
afterwards
did
mention
carrington
appointment
to
ratcliffe
and
she
told
carrington
that
the
secretary
certainly
looked
hurt
and
mortified
but
showed
it
only
by
almost
instantly
changing
the
subject
chapter
x
the
next
morning
carrington
called
at
the
department
and
announced
his
acceptance
of
the
post
he
was
told
that
his
instructions
would
be
ready
in
about
a
fortnight
and
that
he
would
be
expected
to
start
as
soon
as
he
received
them
in
the
meanwhile
he
must
devote
himself
to
the
study
of
a
mass
of
papers
in
the
department
there
was
no
trifling
allowable
here
carrington
had
to
set
himself
vigorously
to
work
this
did
not
however
prevent
him
from
keeping
his
appointment
with
sybil
and
at
four
they
started
together
passing
out
into
the
quiet
shadows
of
rock
creek
and
seeking
still
lanes
through
the
woods
where
their
horses
walked
side
by
side
and
they
themselves
could
talk
without
the
risk
of
criticism
from
curious
eyes
it
was
the
afternoon
of
one
of
those
sultry
and
lowering
spring
days
when
life
germinates
rapidly
but
as
yet
gives
no
sign
except
perhaps
some
new
leaf
or
flower
pushing
its
soft
head
up
against
the
dead
leaves
that
have
sheltered
it
the
two
riders
had
something
of
the
same
sensation
as
though
the
leafless
woods
and
the
laurel
thickets
the
warm
moist
air
and
the
low
clouds
were
a
protection
and
a
soft
shelter
somewhat
to
carrington
surprise
he
found
that
it
was
pleasant
to
have
sybil
company
he
felt
towards
her
as
to
a
sister
a
favourite
sister
she
at
once
attacked
him
for
abandoning
her
and
breaking
his
treaty
so
lately
made
and
he
tried
to
gain
her
sympathy
by
saying
that
if
she
knew
how
much
he
was
troubled
she
would
forgive
him
then
when
sybil
asked
whether
he
really
must
go
and
leave
her
without
any
friend
whom
she
could
speak
to
his
feelings
got
the
better
of
him
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
confide
all
his
troubles
in
her
since
there
was
no
one
else
in
whom
he
could
confide
he
told
her
plainly
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
sister
you
say
that
love
is
nonsense
miss
ross
i
tell
you
it
is
no
such
thing
for
weeks
and
months
it
is
a
steady
physical
pain
an
ache
about
the
heart
never
leaving
one
by
night
or
by
day
a
long
strain
on
nerves
like
toothache
or
rheumatism
not
intolerable
at
any
one
instant
but
exhausting
by
its
steady
drain
on
the
strength
it
is
a
disease
to
be
borne
with
patience
like
any
other
nervous
complaint
and
to
be
treated
with
my
trip
to
mexico
will
be
good
for
it
but
that
is
not
the
reason
why
i
must
then
he
told
her
all
his
private
circumstances
the
ruin
which
the
war
had
brought
on
him
and
his
family
how
of
his
two
brothers
one
had
survived
the
war
only
to
die
at
home
a
mere
wreck
of
disease
privation
and
wounds
the
other
had
been
shot
by
his
side
and
bled
slowly
to
death
in
his
arms
during
the
awful
carnage
in
the
wilderness
how
his
mother
and
two
sisters
were
struggling
for
a
bare
subsistence
on
a
wretched
virginian
farm
and
how
all
his
exertions
barely
kept
them
from
beggary
you
have
no
conception
of
the
poverty
to
which
our
southern
women
are
reduced
since
the
war
said
he
they
are
many
of
them
literally
without
clothes
or
the
fee
he
should
earn
by
going
to
mexico
would
double
his
income
this
year
could
he
refuse
had
he
a
right
to
refuse
and
poor
carrington
added
with
a
groan
that
if
he
alone
were
in
question
he
would
sooner
be
shot
than
go
sybil
listened
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
never
before
had
seen
a
man
show
suffering
the
misery
she
had
known
in
life
had
been
more
or
less
veiled
to
her
and
softened
by
falling
on
older
and
friendly
shoulders
she
now
got
for
the
first
time
a
clear
view
of
carrington
apart
from
the
quiet
exterior
in
which
the
man
was
hidden
she
felt
quite
sure
by
a
sudden
flash
of
feminine
inspiration
that
the
curious
look
of
patient
endurance
on
his
face
was
the
work
of
a
single
night
when
he
had
held
his
brother
in
his
arms
and
knew
that
the
blood
was
draining
drop
by
drop
from
his
side
in
the
dense
tangled
woods
beyond
the
reach
of
help
hour
after
hour
till
the
voice
failed
and
the
limbs
grew
stiff
and
cold
when
he
had
finished
his
story
she
was
afraid
to
speak
she
did
not
know
how
to
show
her
sympathy
and
she
could
not
bear
to
seem
unsympathetic
in
her
embarrassment
she
fairly
broke
down
and
could
only
dry
her
eyes
in
silence
having
once
got
this
weight
of
confidence
off
his
mind
carrington
felt
comparatively
gay
and
was
ready
to
make
the
best
of
things
he
laughed
at
himself
to
drive
away
the
tears
of
his
pretty
companion
and
obliged
her
to
take
a
solemn
pledge
never
to
betray
him
of
course
your
sister
knows
it
all
he
said
but
she
must
never
know
that
i
told
you
and
i
never
would
tell
any
one
but
sybil
promised
faithfully
to
keep
his
confidence
to
herself
and
she
went
on
to
defend
her
sister
you
must
not
blame
madeleine
said
she
if
you
knew
as
well
as
i
do
what
she
has
been
through
you
would
not
think
her
cold
you
do
know
how
suddenly
her
husband
died
after
only
one
day
illness
and
what
a
nice
fellow
he
was
she
was
very
fond
of
him
and
his
death
seemed
to
stun
her
we
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
it
she
was
so
quiet
and
natural
then
just
a
week
later
her
little
child
died
of
diphtheria
suffering
horribly
and
she
wild
with
despair
because
she
could
not
relieve
it
after
that
she
was
almost
insane
indeed
i
have
always
thought
she
was
quite
insane
for
a
time
i
know
she
was
excessively
violent
and
wanted
to
kill
herself
and
i
never
heard
any
one
rave
as
she
did
about
religion
and
resignation
and
god
after
a
few
weeks
she
became
quiet
and
stupid
and
went
about
like
a
machine
and
at
last
she
got
over
it
but
has
never
been
what
she
was
before
you
know
she
was
a
rather
fast
new
york
girl
before
she
married
and
cared
no
more
about
politics
and
philanthropy
than
i
do
it
was
a
very
late
thing
all
this
stuff
but
she
is
not
really
hard
though
she
may
seem
so
it
is
all
on
the
surface
i
always
know
when
she
is
thinking
about
her
husband
or
child
because
her
face
gets
rigid
she
looks
then
as
she
used
to
look
after
her
child
died
as
though
she
did
care
what
became
of
her
and
she
would
just
as
lieve
kill
herself
as
not
i
do
think
she
will
ever
let
herself
love
any
one
again
she
has
a
horror
of
it
she
is
much
more
likely
to
go
in
for
ambition
or
duty
or
they
rode
on
for
a
while
in
silence
carrington
perplexed
by
the
problem
how
two
harmless
people
such
as
madeleine
and
he
could
have
been
made
by
a
beneficent
providence
the
sport
of
such
cruel
tortures
and
sybil
equally
interested
in
thinking
what
sort
of
a
carrington
would
make
on
the
whole
she
thought
she
liked
him
better
as
he
was
the
silence
was
only
broken
by
carrington
bringing
the
conversation
back
to
its
something
must
be
done
to
keep
your
sister
out
of
ratcliffe
power
i
have
thought
about
it
till
i
am
tired
can
you
make
no
suggestion
no
sybil
was
helpless
and
dreadfully
alarmed
ratcliffe
came
to
the
house
as
often
as
he
could
and
seemed
to
tell
madeleine
everything
that
was
going
on
in
politics
and
ask
her
advice
and
madeleine
did
not
discourage
him
i
do
believe
she
likes
it
and
thinks
she
can
do
some
good
by
it
i
do
dare
speak
to
her
about
it
she
thinks
me
a
child
still
and
treats
me
as
though
i
were
fifteen
what
can
i
do
carrington
said
he
had
thought
of
speaking
to
lee
himself
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
if
he
offended
her
he
might
drive
her
directly
into
ratcliffe
arms
but
sybil
thought
she
would
not
be
offended
if
he
went
to
work
in
the
right
way
she
will
stand
more
from
you
than
from
any
one
else
tell
her
openly
that
you
that
you
love
her
said
sybil
with
a
burst
of
desperate
courage
she
ca
take
offence
at
that
and
then
you
can
say
almost
carrington
looked
at
sybil
with
more
admiration
than
he
had
ever
expected
to
feel
for
her
and
began
to
think
that
he
might
do
worse
than
to
put
himself
under
her
orders
after
all
she
had
some
practical
sense
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
she
was
handsomer
than
ever
as
she
sat
erect
on
her
horse
the
rich
colour
rushing
up
under
the
warm
skin
at
the
impropriety
of
her
speech
you
are
certainly
right
said
he
after
all
i
have
nothing
to
lose
whether
she
marries
ratcliffe
or
not
she
will
never
marry
me
i
this
speech
was
a
cowardly
attempt
to
beg
encouragement
from
sybil
and
met
with
the
fate
it
deserved
for
sybil
highly
flattered
at
carrington
implied
praise
and
bold
as
a
lioness
now
that
it
was
carrington
fingers
and
not
her
own
that
were
to
go
into
the
fire
gave
him
on
the
spot
a
feminine
view
of
the
situation
that
did
not
encourage
his
hopes
she
plainly
said
that
men
seemed
to
take
leave
of
their
senses
as
soon
as
women
were
concerned
for
her
part
she
could
not
understand
what
there
was
in
any
woman
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
she
thought
most
women
were
horrid
men
were
ever
so
much
nicer
and
as
for
madeleine
whom
all
of
you
are
ready
to
cut
each
other
throats
about
she
a
dear
good
sister
as
good
as
gold
and
i
love
her
with
all
my
heart
but
you
would
like
her
any
of
you
if
you
married
her
she
has
always
had
her
own
way
and
she
could
not
help
taking
it
she
never
could
learn
to
take
yours
both
of
you
would
be
unhappy
in
a
week
and
as
for
that
old
ratcliffe
she
would
make
his
life
a
burden
and
i
hope
she
will
concluded
sybil
with
a
spiteful
little
explosion
of
hatred
carrington
could
not
help
being
amused
by
sybil
way
of
dealing
with
affairs
of
the
heart
emboldened
by
encouragement
she
went
on
to
attack
him
pitilessly
for
going
down
on
his
knees
before
her
sister
just
as
though
you
were
not
as
good
as
she
is
and
openly
avowed
that
if
she
were
a
man
she
would
at
least
have
some
pride
men
like
this
kind
of
punishment
carrington
did
not
attempt
to
defend
himself
he
even
courted
attack
they
both
enjoyed
their
ride
through
the
bare
woods
by
the
rippling
spring
streams
under
the
languid
breath
of
the
moist
south
wind
it
was
a
small
idyll
all
the
more
pleasant
because
there
was
gloom
before
and
behind
it
sybil
irrepressible
gaiety
made
carrington
doubt
whether
after
all
life
need
be
so
serious
a
matter
she
had
animal
spirits
in
plenty
and
it
needed
an
effort
for
her
to
keep
them
down
while
carrington
spirits
were
nearly
exhausted
after
twenty
years
of
strain
and
he
required
a
greater
effort
to
hold
himself
up
there
was
every
reason
why
he
should
be
grateful
to
sybil
for
lending
to
him
from
her
superfluity
he
enjoyed
being
laughed
at
by
her
suppose
madeleine
lee
did
refuse
to
marry
him
what
of
it
pooh
said
sybil
you
men
are
all
just
alike
how
can
you
be
so
silly
madeleine
and
you
would
be
intolerable
together
do
find
some
one
who
wo
be
solemn
they
laid
out
their
little
plot
against
madeleine
and
elaborated
it
carefully
both
as
to
what
carrington
should
say
and
how
he
should
say
it
for
sybil
asserted
that
men
were
too
stupid
to
be
trusted
even
in
making
a
declaration
of
love
and
must
be
taught
like
little
children
to
say
their
prayers
carrington
enjoyed
being
taught
how
to
make
a
declaration
of
love
he
did
not
ask
where
sybil
had
learned
so
much
about
men
stupidity
he
thought
perhaps
schneidekoupon
could
have
thrown
light
on
the
subject
at
all
events
they
were
so
busily
occupied
with
their
schemes
and
lessons
that
they
did
home
till
madeleine
had
become
anxious
lest
they
had
met
with
some
accident
the
long
dusk
had
become
darkness
before
she
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
on
the
asphalt
pavement
and
she
went
down
to
the
door
to
scold
them
for
their
delay
sybil
only
laughed
at
her
and
said
it
was
all
carrington
fault
he
had
lost
his
way
and
she
had
been
forced
to
find
it
for
him
ten
days
more
passed
before
their
plan
was
carried
into
effect
april
had
come
carrington
work
was
completed
and
he
was
ready
to
start
on
his
journey
then
at
last
he
appeared
one
evening
at
lee
at
the
very
moment
when
sybil
as
chance
would
have
it
was
going
out
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
with
her
friend
victoria
dare
a
few
doors
away
carrington
felt
a
little
ashamed
as
she
went
this
kind
of
conspiracy
behind
lee
back
was
not
to
his
taste
he
resolutely
sat
down
and
plunged
at
once
into
his
subject
he
was
almost
ready
to
go
he
said
he
had
nearly
completed
his
work
in
the
department
and
he
was
assured
that
his
instructions
and
papers
would
be
ready
in
two
days
more
he
might
not
have
another
chance
to
see
lee
so
quietly
again
and
he
wanted
to
take
his
leave
now
for
this
was
what
lay
most
heavily
on
his
mind
he
should
have
gone
willingly
and
gladly
if
it
had
not
been
for
uneasiness
about
her
and
yet
he
had
till
now
been
afraid
to
speak
openly
on
the
subject
here
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
though
to
invite
some
reply
madeleine
laid
down
her
work
with
a
look
of
regret
though
not
of
annoyance
and
said
frankly
and
instantly
that
he
had
been
too
good
a
friend
to
allow
of
her
taking
offence
at
anything
he
could
say
she
would
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
him
my
affairs
she
added
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
seem
to
have
become
public
property
and
i
would
rather
have
some
voice
in
discussing
them
myself
than
to
know
they
are
discussed
behind
my
this
was
a
sharp
thrust
at
the
very
outset
but
carrington
turned
it
aside
and
went
quietly
on
you
are
frank
and
loyal
as
you
always
are
i
will
be
so
too
i
help
being
so
for
months
i
have
had
no
other
pleasure
than
in
being
near
you
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
known
what
it
is
to
forget
my
own
affairs
in
loving
a
woman
who
seems
to
me
without
a
fault
and
for
one
solitary
word
from
whom
i
would
give
all
i
have
in
life
and
perhaps
madeleine
flushed
and
bent
towards
him
with
an
earnestness
of
manner
that
repeated
itself
in
her
tone
mr
carrington
i
am
the
best
friend
you
have
on
earth
one
of
these
days
you
will
thank
me
with
your
whole
soul
for
refusing
to
listen
to
you
now
you
do
not
know
how
much
misery
i
am
saving
you
i
have
no
heart
to
give
you
want
a
young
fresh
life
to
help
yours
a
gay
lively
temperament
to
enliven
your
despondency
some
one
still
young
enough
to
absorb
herself
in
you
and
make
all
her
existence
yours
i
could
not
do
it
i
can
give
you
nothing
i
have
done
my
best
to
persuade
myself
that
some
day
i
might
begin
life
again
with
the
old
hopes
and
feelings
but
it
is
no
use
the
fire
is
burned
out
if
you
married
me
you
would
destroy
yourself
you
would
wake
up
some
day
and
find
the
universe
dust
and
carrington
listened
in
silence
he
made
no
attempt
to
interrupt
or
to
contradict
her
only
at
the
end
he
said
with
a
little
bitterness
my
own
life
is
worth
so
much
to
the
world
and
to
me
that
i
suppose
it
would
be
wrong
to
risk
it
on
such
a
venture
but
i
would
risk
it
nevertheless
if
you
gave
me
the
chance
do
you
think
me
wicked
for
tempting
providence
i
do
not
mean
to
annoy
you
with
entreaties
i
have
a
little
pride
left
and
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
you
yet
i
think
in
spite
of
all
you
have
said
or
can
say
that
one
disappointed
life
may
be
as
able
to
find
happiness
and
repose
in
another
as
to
get
them
by
sucking
the
young
of
a
fresh
to
this
speech
which
was
unusually
figurative
for
carrington
lee
could
find
no
ready
answer
she
could
only
reply
that
carrington
life
was
worth
quite
as
much
as
his
neighbour
and
that
it
was
worth
so
much
to
her
if
not
to
himself
that
she
would
not
let
him
wreck
it
carrington
went
on
forgive
my
talking
in
this
way
i
do
not
mean
to
complain
i
shall
always
love
you
just
as
much
whether
you
care
for
me
or
not
because
you
are
the
only
woman
i
have
ever
met
or
am
ever
likely
to
meet
who
seems
to
me
if
this
was
sybil
teaching
she
had
made
the
best
of
her
time
carrington
tone
and
words
pierced
through
all
lee
armour
as
though
they
were
pointed
with
the
most
ingenious
cruelty
and
designed
to
torture
her
she
felt
hard
and
small
before
him
life
for
life
his
had
been
and
was
now
far
less
bright
than
hers
yet
he
was
her
superior
he
sat
there
a
true
man
carrying
his
burden
calmly
quietly
without
complaint
ready
to
face
the
next
shock
of
life
with
the
same
endurance
he
had
shown
against
the
rest
and
he
thought
her
perfect
she
felt
humiliated
that
any
brave
man
should
say
to
her
face
that
he
thought
her
perfect
she
perfect
in
her
contrition
she
was
half
ready
to
go
down
at
his
feet
and
confess
her
sins
her
hysterical
dread
of
sorrow
and
suffering
her
narrow
sympathies
her
feeble
faith
her
miserable
selfishness
her
abject
cowardice
every
nerve
in
her
body
tingled
with
shame
when
she
thought
what
a
miserable
fraud
she
was
what
a
mass
of
pretensions
unfounded
of
deceit
ingrained
she
was
ready
to
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
she
was
disgusted
outraged
with
her
own
image
as
she
saw
it
contrasted
with
carrington
single
word
perfect
nor
was
this
the
worst
carrington
was
not
the
first
man
who
had
thought
her
perfect
to
hear
this
word
suddenly
used
again
which
had
never
been
uttered
to
her
before
except
by
lips
now
dead
and
gone
made
her
brain
reel
she
seemed
to
hear
her
husband
once
more
telling
her
that
she
was
perfect
yet
against
this
torture
she
had
a
better
defence
she
had
long
since
hardened
herself
to
bear
these
recollections
and
they
steadied
and
strengthened
her
she
had
been
called
perfect
before
now
and
what
had
come
of
it
two
graves
and
a
broken
life
she
drew
herself
up
with
a
face
now
grown
quite
pale
and
rigid
in
reply
to
carrington
she
said
not
a
word
but
only
shook
her
head
slightly
without
looking
at
him
he
went
on
after
all
it
is
not
my
own
happiness
i
am
thinking
of
but
yours
i
never
was
vain
enough
to
think
that
i
was
worth
your
love
or
that
i
could
ever
win
it
your
happiness
is
another
thing
i
care
so
much
for
that
as
to
make
me
dread
going
away
for
fear
that
you
may
yet
find
yourself
entangled
in
this
wretched
political
life
here
when
perhaps
if
i
stayed
i
might
be
of
some
do
you
really
think
then
that
i
am
going
to
fall
a
victim
to
ratcliffe
asked
madeleine
with
a
cold
smile
why
not
replied
carrington
in
a
similar
tone
he
can
put
forward
a
strong
claim
to
your
sympathy
and
help
if
not
to
your
love
he
can
offer
you
a
great
field
of
usefulness
which
you
want
he
has
been
very
faithful
to
you
are
you
quite
sure
that
even
now
you
can
refuse
him
without
his
complaining
that
you
have
trifled
with
him
and
are
you
quite
sure
added
lee
evasively
that
you
have
not
been
judging
him
much
too
harshly
i
think
i
know
him
better
than
you
he
has
many
good
qualities
and
some
high
ones
what
harm
can
he
do
me
supposing
even
that
he
did
succeed
in
persuading
me
that
my
life
could
be
best
used
in
helping
his
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
it
you
and
i
said
carrington
are
wide
apart
in
our
estimates
of
ratcliffe
to
you
of
course
he
shows
his
best
side
he
is
on
his
good
behaviour
and
knows
that
any
false
step
will
ruin
him
i
see
in
him
only
a
coarse
selfish
unprincipled
politician
who
would
either
drag
you
down
to
his
own
level
or
what
is
more
likely
would
very
soon
disgust
you
and
make
your
life
a
wretched
before
his
vulgar
ambition
or
compel
you
to
leave
him
in
either
case
you
would
be
the
victim
you
can
not
afford
to
make
another
false
start
in
life
reject
me
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
it
but
be
on
your
guard
against
giving
your
existence
up
to
why
do
you
think
so
ill
of
ratcliffe
asked
madeleine
he
always
speaks
highly
of
you
do
you
know
anything
against
him
that
the
world
does
not
his
public
acts
are
enough
to
satisfy
me
replied
carrington
evading
a
part
of
the
question
you
know
that
i
have
never
had
but
one
opinion
about
there
was
a
pause
in
the
conversation
both
parties
felt
that
as
yet
no
good
had
come
of
it
at
length
madeleine
asked
what
would
you
have
me
do
is
it
a
pledge
you
want
that
i
will
under
no
circumstances
marry
ratcliffe
certainly
not
was
the
answer
you
know
me
better
than
to
think
i
would
ask
that
i
only
want
you
to
take
time
and
keep
out
of
his
influence
until
your
mind
is
fairly
made
up
a
year
hence
i
feel
certain
that
you
will
think
of
him
as
i
then
you
will
allow
me
to
marry
him
if
i
find
that
you
are
mistaken
said
lee
with
a
marked
tone
of
sarcasm
carrington
looked
annoyed
but
he
answered
quietly
what
i
fear
is
his
influence
here
and
now
what
i
would
like
to
see
you
do
is
this
go
north
a
month
earlier
than
you
intended
and
without
giving
him
time
to
act
if
i
were
sure
you
were
safely
in
newport
i
should
feel
no
you
seem
to
have
as
bad
an
opinion
of
washington
as
gore
said
madeleine
with
a
contemptuous
smile
he
gave
me
the
same
advice
though
he
was
afraid
to
tell
me
why
i
am
not
a
child
i
am
thirty
years
old
and
have
seen
something
of
the
world
i
am
not
afraid
like
gore
of
washington
malaria
or
like
you
of
ratcliffe
influence
if
i
fall
a
victim
i
shall
deserve
my
fate
and
certainly
i
shall
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
my
friends
they
have
given
me
advice
enough
for
a
carrington
face
darkened
with
a
deeper
shade
of
regret
the
turn
which
the
conversation
had
taken
was
precisely
what
he
had
expected
and
both
sybil
and
he
had
agreed
that
madeleine
would
probably
answer
just
in
this
way
nevertheless
he
could
not
but
feel
acutely
the
harm
he
was
doing
to
his
own
interests
and
it
was
only
by
a
sheer
effort
of
the
will
that
he
forced
himself
to
a
last
and
more
earnest
attack
i
know
it
is
an
impertinence
he
said
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
show
how
much
it
costs
me
to
offend
you
this
is
the
first
time
you
ever
had
occasion
to
be
offended
if
i
were
to
yield
to
the
fear
of
your
anger
and
were
to
hold
my
tongue
now
and
by
any
chance
you
were
to
wreck
your
life
on
this
rock
i
should
never
forgive
myself
the
cowardice
i
should
always
think
i
might
have
done
something
to
prevent
it
this
is
probably
the
last
time
i
shall
have
the
chance
to
talk
openly
with
you
and
i
implore
you
to
listen
to
me
i
want
nothing
for
myself
if
i
knew
i
should
never
see
you
again
i
would
still
say
the
same
thing
leave
washington
leave
it
now
at
once
without
giving
more
than
hours
notice
leave
it
without
letting
ratcliffe
see
you
again
in
private
come
back
next
winter
if
you
please
and
then
accept
him
if
you
think
proper
i
only
pray
you
to
think
long
about
it
and
decide
when
you
are
not
madeleine
eyes
flashed
and
she
threw
aside
her
embroidery
with
an
impatient
gesture
no
carrington
i
will
not
be
dictated
to
i
will
carry
out
my
own
plans
i
do
not
mean
to
marry
ratcliffe
if
i
had
meant
it
i
should
have
done
it
before
now
but
i
will
not
run
away
from
him
or
from
myself
it
would
be
unladylike
undignified
carrington
could
say
no
more
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
lesson
a
long
silence
ensued
and
then
he
rose
to
go
are
you
angry
with
me
said
she
in
a
softer
tone
i
ought
to
ask
that
question
said
he
can
you
forgive
me
i
am
afraid
not
no
man
can
say
to
a
woman
what
i
have
said
to
you
and
be
quite
forgiven
you
will
never
think
of
me
again
as
you
would
have
done
if
i
had
not
spoken
i
knew
that
before
i
did
it
as
for
me
i
can
only
go
on
with
my
old
life
it
is
not
gay
and
will
not
be
the
gayer
for
our
talk
madeleine
relented
a
little
friendships
like
ours
are
not
so
easily
broken
she
said
do
not
do
me
another
injustice
you
will
see
me
again
before
you
go
he
assented
and
bade
lee
weary
and
disturbed
in
mind
hastened
to
her
room
when
miss
sybil
comes
in
tell
her
that
i
am
not
very
well
and
have
gone
to
bed
were
her
instructions
to
her
maid
and
sybil
thought
she
knew
the
cause
of
this
headache
but
before
carrington
departure
he
had
one
more
ride
with
sybil
and
reported
to
her
the
result
of
the
interview
at
which
both
of
them
confessed
themselves
much
depressed
carrington
expressed
some
hope
that
madeleine
meant
after
a
sort
to
give
a
kind
of
pledge
by
saying
that
she
had
no
intention
of
marrying
ratcliffe
but
sybil
shook
her
head
emphatically
how
can
a
woman
tell
whether
she
is
going
to
accept
a
man
until
she
is
asked
said
she
with
entire
confidence
as
though
she
were
stating
the
simplest
fact
in
the
world
carrington
looked
puzzled
and
ventured
to
ask
whether
women
did
not
generally
make
up
their
minds
beforehand
on
such
an
interesting
point
but
sybil
overwhelmed
him
with
contempt
what
good
will
they
do
by
making
up
their
minds
i
should
like
to
know
of
course
they
would
go
and
do
the
opposite
sensible
women
pretend
to
make
up
their
minds
carrington
but
you
men
are
so
stupid
and
you
ca
understand
in
the
carrington
gave
it
up
and
went
back
to
his
stale
question
could
sybil
suggest
any
other
resource
and
sybil
sadly
confessed
that
she
could
not
so
far
as
she
could
see
they
must
trust
to
luck
and
she
thought
it
was
cruel
tor
carrington
to
go
away
and
leave
her
alone
without
help
he
had
promised
to
prevent
the
marriage
one
thing
more
i
mean
to
do
said
carrington
and
here
everything
will
depend
on
your
courage
and
nerve
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
ratcliffe
will
offer
himself
before
you
go
north
he
does
not
suspect
you
of
making
trouble
and
he
will
not
think
about
you
in
any
way
if
you
let
him
alone
and
keep
quiet
when
he
does
offer
himself
you
will
know
it
at
least
your
sister
will
tell
you
if
she
has
accepted
him
if
she
refuses
him
point
blank
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
her
steady
if
you
see
her
hesitating
you
must
break
in
at
any
cost
and
use
all
your
influence
to
stop
her
be
bold
then
and
do
your
best
if
everything
fails
and
she
still
clings
to
him
i
must
play
my
last
card
or
rather
you
must
play
it
for
me
i
shall
leave
with
you
a
sealed
letter
which
you
are
to
give
her
if
everything
else
fails
do
it
before
she
sees
ratcliffe
a
second
time
see
that
she
reads
it
and
if
necessary
make
her
read
it
no
matter
when
or
where
no
one
else
must
know
that
it
exists
and
you
must
take
as
much
care
of
it
as
though
it
were
a
diamond
you
are
not
to
know
what
is
in
it
it
must
be
a
complete
secret
do
you
understand
sybil
thought
she
did
but
her
heart
sank
when
shall
you
give
me
this
letter
she
asked
the
evening
before
i
start
when
i
come
to
bid
probably
next
sunday
this
letter
is
our
last
hope
if
after
reading
that
she
does
not
give
him
up
you
will
have
to
pack
your
trunk
my
dear
sybil
and
find
a
new
home
for
you
can
never
live
with
he
had
never
before
called
her
by
her
first
name
and
it
pleased
her
to
hear
it
now
though
she
generally
had
a
strong
objection
to
such
familiarities
oh
i
wish
you
were
not
going
she
exclaimed
tearfully
what
shall
i
do
when
you
are
gone
at
this
pitiful
appeal
carrington
felt
a
sudden
pang
he
found
that
he
was
not
so
old
as
he
had
thought
certainly
he
had
grown
to
like
her
frank
honesty
and
sound
common
sense
and
he
had
at
length
discovered
that
she
was
handsome
with
a
very
pretty
figure
was
it
not
something
like
a
flirtation
he
had
been
carrying
on
with
this
young
person
for
the
last
month
a
glimmering
of
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
though
he
got
rid
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
for
a
man
of
his
age
and
sobriety
to
be
in
love
with
two
sisters
at
once
was
impossible
still
more
impossible
that
sybil
should
care
for
him
as
for
her
however
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
matter
she
had
grown
to
depend
upon
him
and
she
did
it
with
all
the
blind
confidence
of
youth
to
lose
him
was
a
serious
disaster
she
had
never
before
felt
the
sensation
and
she
thought
it
most
disagreeable
her
youthful
diplomatists
and
admirers
could
not
at
all
fill
carrington
place
they
danced
and
chirruped
cheerfully
on
the
hollow
crust
of
society
but
they
were
wholly
useless
when
one
suddenly
fell
through
and
found
oneself
struggling
in
the
darkness
and
dangers
beneath
young
women
too
are
apt
to
be
flattered
by
the
confidences
of
older
men
they
have
a
keen
palate
for
whatever
savours
of
experience
and
adventure
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
sybil
had
found
a
man
who
gave
some
play
to
her
imagination
one
who
had
been
a
rebel
and
had
grown
used
to
the
shocks
of
fate
so
as
to
walk
with
calmness
into
the
face
of
death
and
to
command
or
obey
with
equal
indifference
she
felt
that
he
would
tell
her
what
to
do
when
the
earthquake
came
and
would
be
at
hand
to
consult
which
is
in
a
woman
eyes
the
great
object
of
men
existence
when
trouble
comes
she
suddenly
conceived
that
washington
would
be
intolerable
without
him
and
that
she
should
never
get
the
courage
to
fight
ratcliffe
alone
or
if
she
did
she
should
make
some
fatal
mistake
they
finished
their
ride
very
soberly
she
began
to
show
a
new
interest
in
all
that
concerned
him
and
asked
many
questions
about
his
sisters
and
their
plantation
she
wanted
to
ask
him
whether
she
could
not
do
something
to
help
them
but
this
seemed
too
awkward
on
his
part
he
made
her
promise
to
write
him
faithfully
all
that
took
place
and
this
request
pleased
her
though
she
knew
his
interest
was
all
on
her
sister
account
the
following
sunday
evening
when
he
came
to
bid
it
was
still
worse
there
was
no
chance
for
private
talk
ratcliffe
was
there
and
several
diplomatists
including
old
jacobi
who
had
eyes
like
a
cat
and
saw
every
motion
of
one
face
victoria
dare
was
on
the
sofa
chattering
with
lord
dunbeg
sybil
would
rather
have
had
any
ordinary
illness
even
to
the
extent
of
a
light
case
of
scarlet
fever
or
than
let
her
know
what
was
the
matter
carrington
found
means
to
get
sybil
into
another
room
for
a
moment
and
to
give
her
the
letter
he
had
promised
then
he
bade
her
and
in
doing
so
he
reminded
her
of
her
promise
to
write
pressing
her
hand
and
looking
into
her
eyes
with
an
earnestness
that
made
her
heart
beat
faster
although
she
said
to
herself
that
his
interest
was
all
about
her
sister
as
it
was
mostly
the
thought
did
not
raise
her
spirits
but
she
went
through
with
her
performance
like
a
heroine
perhaps
she
was
a
little
pleased
to
see
that
he
parted
from
madeleine
with
much
less
apparent
feeling
one
would
have
said
that
they
were
two
good
friends
who
had
no
troublesome
sentiment
to
worry
them
but
then
every
eye
in
the
room
was
watching
this
farewell
and
speculating
about
it
ratcliffe
looked
on
with
particular
interest
and
was
a
little
perplexed
to
account
for
this
too
fraternal
cordiality
could
he
have
made
a
miscalculation
or
was
there
something
behind
he
himself
insisted
upon
shaking
hands
genially
with
carrington
and
wished
him
a
pleasant
journey
and
a
successful
one
that
night
for
the
first
time
since
she
was
a
child
sybil
actually
cried
a
little
after
she
went
to
bed
although
it
is
true
that
her
sentiment
did
not
keep
her
awake
she
felt
lonely
and
weighed
down
by
a
great
responsibility
for
a
day
or
two
afterwards
she
was
nervous
and
restless
she
would
not
ride
or
make
calls
or
see
guests
she
tried
to
sing
a
little
and
found
it
tiresome
she
went
out
and
sat
for
hours
in
the
square
where
the
spring
sun
was
shining
warm
and
bright
on
the
prancing
horse
of
the
great
andrew
jackson
she
was
a
little
cross
too
and
absent
and
spoke
so
often
about
carrington
that
at
last
madeleine
was
struck
by
sudden
suspicion
and
began
to
watch
her
with
anxious
care
tuesday
night
after
this
had
gone
on
for
two
days
sybil
was
in
madeleine
room
where
she
often
stayed
to
talk
while
her
sister
was
at
her
toilet
this
evening
she
threw
herself
listlessly
on
the
couch
and
within
five
minutes
again
quoted
carrington
madeleine
turned
from
the
glass
before
which
she
was
sitting
and
looked
her
steadily
in
the
face
sybil
said
she
this
is
the
time
you
have
mentioned
carrington
since
we
sat
down
to
dinner
i
have
waited
for
the
round
number
to
decide
whether
i
should
take
any
notice
of
it
or
not
what
does
it
mean
my
child
do
you
care
for
carrington
oh
maude
exclaimed
sybil
reproachfully
flushing
so
violently
that
even
by
that
dim
light
her
sister
could
not
but
see
it
lee
rose
and
crossing
the
room
sat
down
by
sybil
who
was
lying
on
the
couch
and
turned
her
face
away
madeleine
put
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
my
poor
poor
child
said
she
pityingly
i
never
dreamed
of
this
what
a
fool
i
have
been
how
could
i
have
been
so
thoughtless
tell
me
she
added
with
a
little
hesitation
has
he
does
he
care
for
you
no
no
cried
sybil
fairly
breaking
down
into
a
burst
of
tears
no
he
loves
you
nobody
but
you
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
me
i
care
for
him
so
very
much
she
continued
drying
her
tears
only
it
seems
so
lonely
now
he
is
lee
remained
on
the
couch
with
her
arm
round
her
neck
silent
gazing
into
vacancy
the
picture
of
perplexity
and
consternation
the
situation
was
getting
beyond
her
control
chapter
xi
in
the
middle
of
april
a
sudden
social
excitement
started
the
indolent
city
of
washington
to
its
feet
the
and
duchess
of
arrived
in
america
on
a
tour
of
pleasure
and
in
due
course
came
on
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
union
the
newspapers
hastened
to
inform
their
readers
that
the
was
a
royal
princess
of
england
and
in
the
want
of
any
other
social
event
every
one
who
had
any
sense
of
what
was
due
to
his
or
her
own
dignity
hastened
to
show
this
august
couple
the
respect
which
all
republicans
who
have
a
large
income
derived
from
business
feel
for
english
royalty
new
york
gave
a
dinner
at
which
the
most
insignificant
person
present
was
worth
at
least
a
million
dollars
and
where
the
gentlemen
who
sat
by
the
princess
entertained
her
for
an
hour
or
two
by
a
calculation
of
the
aggregate
capital
represented
new
york
also
gave
a
ball
at
which
the
princess
appeared
in
an
black
silk
dress
with
mock
lace
and
jet
ornaments
among
several
hundred
toilets
that
proclaimed
the
refined
republican
simplicity
of
their
owners
at
a
cost
of
various
hundred
thousand
dollars
after
these
hospitalities
the
pair
came
on
to
washington
where
they
became
guests
of
lord
skye
or
more
properly
lord
skye
became
their
guest
for
he
seemed
to
consider
that
he
handed
the
legation
over
to
them
and
he
told
lee
with
true
british
bluntness
of
speech
that
they
were
a
great
bore
and
he
wished
they
had
stayed
in
or
wherever
they
belonged
but
as
they
were
here
he
must
be
their
lackey
lee
was
amused
and
a
little
astonished
at
the
candour
with
which
he
talked
about
them
and
she
was
instructed
and
improved
by
his
dry
account
of
the
princess
who
it
seemed
made
herself
disagreeable
by
her
airs
of
royalty
who
had
suffered
dreadfully
from
the
voyage
and
who
detested
america
and
everything
american
but
who
was
not
without
some
show
of
reason
jealous
of
her
husband
and
endured
endless
sufferings
though
with
a
very
bad
grace
rather
than
lose
sight
of
him
not
only
was
lord
skye
obliged
to
turn
the
legation
into
an
hotel
but
in
the
full
enthusiasm
of
his
loyalty
he
felt
himself
called
upon
to
give
a
ball
it
was
he
said
the
easiest
way
of
paying
off
all
his
debts
at
once
and
if
the
princess
was
good
for
nothing
else
she
could
be
utilized
as
a
show
by
way
of
promoting
the
harmony
of
the
two
great
in
other
words
lord
skye
meant
to
exhibit
the
princess
for
his
own
diplomatic
benefit
and
he
did
so
one
would
have
thought
that
at
this
season
when
congress
had
adjourned
washington
would
hardly
have
afforded
society
enough
to
fill
a
but
this
instead
of
being
a
drawback
was
an
advantage
it
permitted
the
british
minister
to
issue
invitations
without
limit
he
asked
not
only
the
president
and
his
cabinet
and
the
judges
and
the
army
and
the
navy
and
all
the
residents
of
washington
who
had
any
claim
to
consideration
but
also
all
the
senators
all
the
representatives
in
congress
all
the
governors
of
states
with
their
staffs
if
they
had
any
all
eminent
citizens
and
their
families
throughout
the
union
and
canada
and
finally
every
private
individual
from
the
north
pole
to
the
isthmus
of
panama
who
had
ever
shown
him
a
civility
or
was
able
to
control
interest
enough
to
ask
for
a
card
the
result
was
that
baltimore
promised
to
come
in
a
body
and
philadelphia
was
equally
new
york
provided
several
scores
of
guests
and
boston
sent
the
governor
and
a
delegation
even
the
millionaire
who
represented
california
in
the
united
states
senate
was
irritated
because
his
invitation
having
been
timed
to
arrive
just
one
day
too
late
he
was
prevented
from
bringing
his
family
across
the
continent
with
a
choice
party
in
a
director
car
to
enjoy
the
smiles
of
royalty
in
the
halls
of
the
british
lion
it
is
astonishing
what
efforts
freemen
will
make
in
a
just
cause
lord
skye
himself
treated
the
whole
affair
with
easy
contempt
one
afternoon
he
strolled
into
lee
parlour
and
begged
her
to
give
him
a
cup
of
tea
he
said
he
had
got
rid
of
his
menagerie
for
a
few
hours
by
shunting
it
off
upon
the
german
legation
and
he
was
by
way
of
wanting
a
little
human
society
sybil
who
was
a
great
favourite
with
him
entreated
to
be
told
all
about
the
ball
but
he
insisted
that
he
knew
no
more
than
she
did
a
man
from
new
york
had
taken
possession
of
the
legation
but
what
he
would
do
with
it
was
not
within
the
foresight
of
the
wisest
trom
the
talk
of
the
young
members
of
his
legation
lord
skye
gathered
that
the
entire
city
was
to
be
roofed
in
and
forty
millions
of
people
expected
but
his
own
concern
in
the
affair
was
limited
to
the
flowers
he
hoped
to
receive
all
young
and
beautiful
women
said
he
to
sybil
are
to
send
me
flowers
i
prefer
jacqueminot
roses
but
will
accept
any
handsome
variety
provided
they
are
not
wired
it
is
diplomatic
etiquette
that
each
lady
who
sends
me
flowers
shall
reserve
at
least
one
dance
for
me
you
will
please
inscribe
this
at
once
upon
your
tablets
miss
to
madeleine
this
ball
was
a
godsend
for
it
came
just
in
time
to
divert
sybil
mind
from
its
troubles
a
week
had
now
passed
since
that
revelation
of
sybil
heart
which
had
come
like
an
earthquake
upon
lee
since
then
sybil
had
been
nervous
and
irritable
all
the
more
because
she
was
conscious
of
being
watched
she
was
in
secret
ashamed
of
her
own
conduct
and
inclined
to
be
angry
with
carrington
as
though
he
were
responsible
for
her
foolishness
but
she
could
not
talk
with
madeleine
on
the
subject
without
discussing
ratcliffe
and
carrington
had
expressly
forbidden
her
to
attack
ratcliffe
until
it
was
clear
that
ratcliffe
had
laid
himself
open
to
attack
this
reticence
deceived
poor
lee
who
saw
in
her
sister
moods
only
that
unrequited
attachment
for
which
she
held
herself
solely
to
blame
her
gross
negligence
in
allowing
sybil
to
be
improperly
exposed
to
such
a
risk
weighed
heavily
on
her
mind
with
a
saint
capacity
for
madeleine
wielded
the
scourge
over
her
own
back
until
the
blood
came
she
saw
the
roses
rapidly
fading
from
sybil
cheeks
and
by
the
help
of
an
active
imagination
she
discovered
a
hectic
look
and
symptoms
of
a
cough
she
became
fairly
morbid
on
the
subject
and
fretted
herself
into
a
fever
upon
which
sybil
sent
on
her
own
responsibility
for
the
medical
man
and
madeleine
was
obliged
to
dose
herself
with
quinine
in
fact
there
was
much
more
reason
for
anxiety
about
her
than
for
her
anxiety
about
sybil
who
barring
a
little
youthful
nervousness
in
the
face
of
responsibility
was
as
healthy
and
comfortable
a
young
woman
as
could
be
shown
in
america
and
whose
sentiment
never
cost
her
five
minutes
sleep
although
her
appetite
may
have
become
a
shade
more
exacting
than
before
madeleine
was
quick
to
notice
this
and
surprised
her
cook
by
making
daily
and
almost
hourly
demands
for
new
and
impossible
dishes
which
she
exhausted
a
library
of
to
discover
lord
skye
ball
and
sybil
interest
in
it
were
a
great
relief
to
madeleine
mind
and
she
now
turned
her
whole
soul
to
frivolity
never
since
she
was
seventeen
had
she
thought
or
talked
so
much
about
a
ball
as
now
about
this
ball
to
the
she
wore
out
her
own
brain
in
the
effort
to
amuse
sybil
she
took
her
to
call
on
the
princess
she
would
have
taken
her
to
call
on
the
grand
lama
had
he
come
to
washington
she
instigated
her
to
order
and
send
to
lord
skye
a
mass
of
the
handsomest
roses
new
york
could
afford
she
set
her
at
work
on
her
dress
several
days
before
there
was
any
occasion
for
it
and
this
famous
costume
had
to
be
taken
out
examined
criticised
and
discussed
with
unending
interest
she
talked
about
the
dress
and
the
princess
and
the
ball
till
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
her
brain
refused
to
act
from
morning
till
night
for
one
entire
week
she
ate
drank
breathed
and
dreamt
of
the
ball
everything
that
love
could
suggest
or
labour
carry
out
she
did
to
amuse
and
occupy
her
sister
she
knew
that
all
this
was
only
temporary
and
palliative
and
that
more
radical
measures
must
be
taken
to
secure
sybil
happiness
on
this
subject
she
thought
in
secret
until
both
head
and
heart
ached
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
was
clear
if
sybil
loved
carrington
she
should
have
him
how
madeleine
expected
to
bring
about
this
change
of
heart
in
carrington
was
known
only
to
herself
she
regarded
men
as
creatures
made
for
women
to
dispose
of
and
capable
of
being
transferred
like
checks
or
from
one
woman
to
another
as
desired
the
only
condition
was
that
he
should
first
be
completely
disabused
of
the
notion
that
he
could
dispose
of
himself
lee
never
doubted
that
she
could
make
carrington
fall
in
love
with
sybil
provided
she
could
place
herself
beyond
his
reach
at
all
events
come
what
might
even
though
she
had
to
accept
the
desperate
alternative
offered
by
ratcliffe
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
sybil
happiness
and
thus
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
lee
began
to
ask
herself
whether
it
was
not
better
to
find
the
solution
of
her
perplexities
in
marriage
would
she
ever
have
been
brought
to
this
point
without
the
violent
pressure
of
her
sister
supposed
interests
this
is
one
of
those
questions
which
wise
men
will
not
ask
because
it
is
one
which
the
wisest
man
or
woman
can
not
answer
upon
this
theme
an
army
of
ingenious
authors
have
exhausted
their
ingenuity
in
entertaining
the
public
and
their
works
are
to
be
found
at
every
they
have
decided
that
any
woman
will
under
the
right
conditions
marry
any
man
at
any
time
provided
her
higher
nature
is
properly
appealed
to
only
with
regret
can
a
writer
forbear
to
moralize
on
this
subject
beauty
and
the
beast
bluebeard
auld
robin
gray
have
the
double
charm
to
authors
of
being
very
pleasant
to
read
and
still
easier
to
dilute
with
sentiment
but
at
least
ten
thousand
modern
writers
with
lord
macaulay
at
their
head
have
so
ravaged
and
despoiled
the
region
of
and
fables
that
an
allusion
even
to
the
arabian
nights
is
no
longer
decent
the
capacity
of
women
to
make
unsuitable
marriages
must
be
considered
as
the
of
society
meanwhile
the
ball
had
in
truth
very
nearly
driven
all
thought
of
carrington
out
of
sybil
mind
the
city
filled
again
the
streets
swarmed
with
fashionable
young
men
and
women
from
the
provinces
of
new
york
philadelphia
and
boston
who
gave
sybil
abundance
of
occupation
she
received
bulletins
of
the
progress
of
affairs
the
president
and
his
wife
had
consented
to
be
present
out
of
their
high
respect
for
her
majesty
the
queen
and
their
desire
to
see
and
to
be
seen
all
the
cabinet
would
accompany
the
chief
magistrate
the
diplomatic
corps
would
appear
in
uniform
so
too
the
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
the
of
canada
was
coming
with
a
staff
lord
skye
remarked
that
the
was
a
flat
the
day
of
the
ball
was
a
day
of
anxiety
to
sybil
although
not
on
account
of
ratcliffe
or
of
carrington
who
were
of
trifling
consequence
compared
with
the
serious
problem
now
before
her
the
responsibility
of
dressing
both
her
sister
and
herself
fell
upon
sybil
who
was
the
real
author
of
all
lee
millinery
triumphs
when
they
now
occurred
except
that
madeleine
managed
to
put
character
into
whatever
she
wore
which
sybil
repudiated
on
her
own
account
on
this
day
sybil
had
reasons
for
special
excitement
all
winter
two
new
dresses
one
especially
a
triumph
of
worth
art
had
lain
in
state
upstairs
and
sybil
had
waited
in
vain
for
an
occasion
that
should
warrant
the
splendour
of
these
garments
one
afternoon
in
early
june
of
the
preceding
summer
worth
had
received
a
letter
on
the
part
of
the
reigning
favourite
of
the
king
of
dahomey
directing
him
to
create
for
her
a
that
should
annihilate
and
utterly
destroy
with
jealousy
and
despair
the
hearts
of
her
rivals
she
was
young
and
beautiful
expense
was
not
a
consideration
such
were
the
words
of
her
chamberlain
all
that
night
the
great
genius
of
the
nineteenth
century
tossed
wakefully
on
his
bed
revolving
the
problem
in
his
mind
visions
of
tints
shot
with
perturbed
his
brain
but
he
fought
against
and
dismissed
them
that
combination
would
be
commonplace
in
dahomey
when
the
first
rays
of
sunlight
showed
him
the
reflection
of
his
careworn
face
in
the
mirrored
ceiling
he
rose
and
with
an
impulse
of
despair
flung
open
the
casements
there
before
his
eyes
lay
the
pure
still
radiant
june
morning
with
a
cry
of
inspiration
the
great
man
leaned
out
of
the
casement
and
rapidly
caught
the
details
of
his
new
conception
before
ten
he
was
again
at
his
bureau
in
paris
an
imperious
order
brought
to
his
private
room
every
silk
satin
and
gauze
within
the
range
of
pale
pink
pale
crocus
pale
green
silver
and
azure
then
came
chromatic
scales
of
colour
combinations
meant
to
vulgarise
the
rainbow
sinfonies
and
fugues
the
twittering
of
birds
and
the
great
peace
of
dewy
nature
maidenhood
in
her
awakening
innocence
the
dawn
in
the
master
rested
content
a
week
later
came
an
order
from
sybil
including
an
entirely
original
unlike
any
other
sent
to
worth
pondered
hesitated
recalled
sybil
figure
the
original
pose
of
her
head
glanced
anxiously
at
the
map
and
speculated
whether
the
new
york
herald
had
a
special
correspondent
at
dahomey
and
at
last
with
a
generosity
peculiar
to
great
souls
he
duplicated
for
miss
ross
new
york
america
the
order
for
mois
de
the
schneidekoupons
and
french
who
had
reappeared
in
washington
came
to
dine
with
lee
on
the
evening
of
the
ball
and
julia
schneidekoupon
sought
in
vain
to
discover
what
sybil
was
going
to
wear
be
happy
my
dear
in
your
ignorance
said
sybil
the
pangs
of
envy
will
rankle
soon
an
hour
later
her
room
except
the
fireplace
where
a
wood
fire
was
gently
smouldering
became
an
altar
of
sacrifice
to
the
deity
of
dawn
in
june
her
bed
her
low
couch
her
little
tables
her
chintz
were
covered
with
portions
of
the
divinity
down
to
slippers
and
handkerchief
gloves
and
bunches
of
fresh
roses
when
at
length
after
a
long
effort
the
work
was
complete
lee
took
a
last
critical
look
at
the
result
and
enjoyed
a
glow
of
satisfaction
young
happy
sparkling
with
consciousness
of
youth
and
beauty
sybil
stood
hebe
anadyomene
rising
from
the
foam
of
soft
creplisse
which
swept
back
beneath
the
long
train
of
pale
tender
pink
silk
fainting
into
breadths
of
delicate
primrose
relieved
here
and
there
by
facings
of
june
green
or
was
it
the
blue
of
early
morning
or
both
suggesting
unutterable
freshness
a
modest
hint
from
her
maid
that
the
girls
as
call
each
other
in
american
households
would
like
to
offer
their
share
of
incense
at
the
shrine
was
amiably
met
and
they
were
allowed
a
glimpse
of
the
divinity
before
she
was
enveloped
in
wraps
an
admiring
group
huddled
in
the
doorway
murmured
approval
from
the
leading
girl
who
was
the
cook
a
coloured
widow
of
some
sixty
winters
whose
admiration
was
irrepressible
down
to
a
new
england
spinster
whose
anabaptist
conscience
wrestled
with
her
instincts
and
who
although
disapproving
of
french
folks
paid
in
her
heart
that
secret
homage
to
their
gowns
and
bonnets
which
her
sterner
lips
refused
the
applause
of
this
audience
has
from
generation
to
generation
cheered
the
hearts
of
myriads
of
young
women
starting
out
on
their
little
adventures
while
the
domestic
laurels
flourish
green
and
fresh
for
one
half
hour
until
they
wither
at
the
threshold
of
the
lee
toiled
long
and
earnestly
over
her
sister
toilet
for
had
not
she
herself
in
her
own
day
been
the
girl
in
new
york
at
least
she
held
that
opinion
and
her
old
instincts
came
to
life
again
whenever
sybil
was
to
be
prepared
for
any
great
occasion
madeleine
kissed
her
sister
affectionately
and
gave
her
unusual
praise
when
the
dawn
in
june
was
complete
sybil
was
at
this
moment
the
ideal
of
blooming
youth
and
lee
almost
dared
to
hope
that
her
heart
was
not
permanently
broken
and
that
she
might
yet
survive
until
carrington
could
be
brought
back
her
own
toilet
was
a
much
shorter
affair
but
sybil
was
impatient
long
before
it
was
concluded
the
carriage
was
waiting
and
she
was
obliged
to
disappoint
her
household
by
coming
down
enveloped
in
her
long
and
hurrying
away
when
at
length
the
sisters
entered
the
at
the
british
legation
lord
skye
rebuked
them
for
not
having
come
early
to
receive
with
him
his
lordship
with
a
huge
riband
across
his
breast
and
a
star
on
his
coat
condescended
to
express
himself
vigorously
on
the
subject
of
the
dawn
in
schneidekoupon
who
was
proud
of
his
easy
use
of
the
latest
artistic
jargon
looked
with
respect
at
satin
and
its
venetian
lace
the
arrangement
of
which
had
been
conscientiously
stolen
from
a
picture
in
the
louvre
and
he
murmured
audibly
nocturne
in
then
turning
to
sybil
and
you
of
course
i
see
a
song
without
words
french
came
up
and
in
his
most
fascinating
tones
exclaimed
why
lee
you
look
real
handsome
jacobi
after
a
close
scrutiny
said
that
he
took
the
liberty
of
an
old
man
in
telling
them
that
they
were
both
dressed
absolutely
without
fault
even
the
was
struck
by
sybil
and
made
lord
skye
introduce
him
after
which
ceremony
he
terrified
her
by
asking
the
pleasure
of
a
waltz
she
disappeared
from
madeleine
view
not
to
be
brought
back
again
until
dawn
met
dawn
the
ball
was
as
the
newspapers
declared
a
brilliant
success
every
one
who
knows
the
city
of
washington
will
recollect
that
among
some
scores
of
magnificent
residences
which
our
own
and
foreign
governments
have
built
for
the
comfort
of
cabinet
officers
judges
diplomatists
speakers
and
senators
the
british
legation
is
by
far
the
most
impressive
combining
in
one
harmonious
whole
the
proportions
of
the
pitti
palace
with
the
decoration
of
the
casa
and
the
dome
of
an
eastern
mosque
this
architectural
triumph
offers
extraordinary
resources
for
society
further
description
is
unnecessary
since
anyone
may
easily
refer
back
to
the
new
york
newspapers
of
the
following
morning
where
accurate
plans
of
the
house
on
the
ground
floor
will
be
found
while
the
illustrated
newspapers
of
the
same
week
contain
excellent
sketches
of
the
most
pleasing
scenic
effects
as
well
as
of
the
and
of
the
princess
smiling
graciously
from
her
throne
the
lady
just
behind
the
princess
on
her
left
is
lee
a
poor
likeness
but
easily
distinguishable
from
the
fact
that
the
artist
for
his
own
objects
has
made
her
rather
shorter
and
the
princess
rather
taller
than
was
strictly
correct
just
as
he
has
given
the
princess
a
gracious
smile
which
was
quite
different
from
her
actual
expression
in
short
the
artist
is
compelled
to
exhibit
the
world
rather
as
we
would
wish
it
to
be
than
as
it
was
or
is
or
indeed
is
like
shortly
to
become
the
strangest
part
of
his
picture
is
however
the
fact
that
he
actually
did
see
lee
where
he
has
put
her
at
the
princess
elbow
which
was
almost
the
last
place
in
the
room
where
any
one
who
knew
lee
would
have
looked
for
her
the
explanation
of
this
curious
accident
shall
be
given
immediately
since
the
facts
are
not
mentioned
in
the
public
reports
of
the
ball
which
only
said
that
close
behind
her
royal
highness
the
stood
our
charming
and
aristocratic
countrywoman
lightfoot
lee
who
has
made
so
great
a
sensation
in
washington
this
winter
and
whose
name
public
rumour
has
connected
with
that
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
her
the
princess
appeared
to
address
most
of
her
the
show
was
a
very
pretty
one
and
on
a
pleasant
april
evening
there
were
many
places
less
agreeable
to
be
in
than
this
much
ground
outside
had
been
roofed
over
to
make
a
large
as
an
with
a
daïs
and
a
sofa
in
the
centre
of
one
long
side
and
another
daïs
with
a
second
sofa
immediately
opposite
to
it
in
the
centre
of
the
other
long
side
each
daïs
had
a
canopy
of
red
velvet
one
bearing
the
lion
and
the
unicorn
the
other
the
american
eagle
the
royal
standard
was
displayed
above
the
unicorn
the
not
quite
so
effectively
waved
above
the
eagle
the
princess
being
no
longer
quite
a
child
found
gas
trying
to
her
complexion
and
compelled
lord
skye
to
illuminate
her
beauty
by
one
hundred
thousand
wax
candies
more
or
less
which
were
arranged
to
be
becoming
about
the
throne
and
to
be
showy
and
unbecoming
about
the
opposite
institution
across
the
way
the
exact
facts
were
these
it
had
happened
that
the
having
been
necessarily
brought
into
contact
with
the
president
and
particularly
with
his
wife
during
the
past
week
had
conceived
for
the
latter
an
antipathy
hardly
to
be
expressed
in
words
her
fixed
determination
was
at
any
cost
to
keep
the
presidential
party
at
a
distance
and
it
was
only
after
a
stormy
scene
that
the
and
lord
skye
succeeded
in
extorting
her
consent
that
the
president
should
take
her
to
supper
further
than
this
she
would
not
go
she
would
not
speak
to
that
woman
as
she
called
the
president
wife
nor
be
in
her
neighbourhood
she
would
rather
stay
in
her
own
room
all
the
evening
and
she
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
the
queen
would
think
of
it
for
she
was
no
subject
of
the
queen
the
case
was
a
hard
one
for
lord
skye
who
was
perplexed
to
know
from
this
point
of
view
why
he
was
entertaining
the
princess
at
all
but
with
the
help
of
the
and
lord
dunbeg
who
was
very
active
and
smiled
deprecation
with
some
success
he
found
a
way
out
of
it
and
this
was
the
reason
why
there
were
two
thrones
in
the
and
why
the
british
throne
was
lighted
with
such
careful
reference
to
the
princess
complexion
lord
skye
immolated
himself
in
the
usual
effort
of
british
and
american
ministers
to
keep
the
two
great
powers
apart
he
and
the
and
lord
dunbeg
acted
as
buffers
with
watchful
diligence
dexterity
and
success
as
one
resource
lord
skye
had
bethought
himself
of
lee
and
he
told
the
princess
the
story
of
lee
relations
with
the
president
wife
a
story
which
was
no
secret
in
washington
for
apart
from
madeleine
own
account
society
was
left
in
no
doubt
of
the
light
in
which
lee
was
regarded
by
the
mistress
of
the
white
house
whom
washington
ladles
were
now
in
the
habit
of
drawing
out
on
the
subject
of
lee
and
who
always
rose
to
the
bait
with
fresh
vivacity
to
the
amusement
and
delight
of
victoria
dare
and
other
she
will
not
trouble
you
so
long
as
you
can
keep
lee
in
your
neighbourhood
said
lord
skye
and
the
princess
accordingly
seized
upon
lee
and
brandished
her
as
though
she
were
a
charm
against
the
evil
eye
in
the
face
of
the
president
party
she
made
lee
take
a
place
just
behind
her
as
though
she
were
a
she
even
graciously
permitted
her
to
sit
down
so
near
that
their
chairs
touched
whenever
that
woman
was
within
sight
which
was
most
of
the
time
the
princess
directed
her
conversation
entirely
to
lee
and
took
care
to
make
it
evident
even
before
the
presidential
party
had
arrived
madeleine
had
fallen
into
the
princess
grasp
and
when
the
princess
went
forward
to
receive
the
president
and
his
wife
which
she
did
with
a
bow
of
stately
and
distant
dignity
she
dragged
madeleine
closely
by
her
side
lee
bowed
too
she
could
not
well
help
it
but
was
cut
dead
for
her
pains
with
a
glare
of
contempt
and
hatred
lord
skye
who
was
acting
as
cavalier
to
the
president
wife
was
and
hastened
to
march
his
democratic
potentate
away
under
pretence
of
showing
her
the
decorations
he
placed
her
at
last
on
her
own
throne
where
he
and
the
relieved
each
other
in
standing
guard
at
intervals
throughout
the
evening
when
the
princess
followed
with
the
president
she
compelled
her
husband
to
take
lee
on
his
arm
and
conduct
her
to
the
british
throne
with
no
other
object
than
to
exasperate
the
president
wife
who
from
her
elevated
platform
looked
down
upon
the
cortège
with
a
scowl
in
all
this
affair
lee
was
the
principal
sufferer
no
one
could
relieve
her
and
she
was
literally
penned
in
as
she
sat
the
princess
kept
up
an
incessant
fire
of
small
conversation
principally
complaint
and
which
no
one
dared
to
interrupt
lee
was
painfully
bored
and
after
a
time
even
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
ceased
to
amuse
her
she
had
too
the
to
make
one
or
two
remarks
which
appealed
to
some
hidden
sense
of
humour
in
the
princess
who
laughed
and
in
the
style
of
royal
personages
gave
her
to
understand
that
she
would
like
more
amusement
of
the
same
sort
of
all
things
in
life
lee
held
this
kind
of
in
contempt
for
she
was
something
more
than
republican
a
little
communistic
at
heart
and
her
only
serious
complaint
of
the
president
and
his
wife
was
that
they
undertook
to
have
a
court
and
to
ape
monarchy
she
had
no
notion
of
admitting
social
superiority
in
any
one
president
or
prince
and
to
be
suddenly
converted
into
a
to
a
small
german
was
a
terrible
blow
but
what
was
to
be
done
lord
skye
had
drafted
her
into
the
service
and
she
could
not
decently
refuse
to
help
him
when
he
came
to
her
side
and
told
her
with
his
usual
calm
directness
what
his
difficulties
were
and
how
he
counted
upon
her
to
help
him
out
the
same
play
went
on
at
supper
where
there
was
a
table
which
held
about
two
dozen
guests
and
the
two
great
ladies
presiding
as
far
apart
as
they
could
be
placed
the
and
lord
skye
on
either
side
of
the
president
wife
did
their
duty
like
men
and
were
rewarded
by
receiving
from
her
much
information
about
the
domestic
arrangements
of
the
white
house
the
president
however
who
sat
next
the
princess
at
the
opposite
end
was
evidently
depressed
owing
partly
to
the
fact
that
the
princess
in
defiance
of
all
etiquette
had
compelled
lord
dunbeg
to
take
lee
to
supper
and
to
place
her
directly
next
the
president
madeleine
tried
to
escape
but
was
stopped
by
the
princess
who
addressed
her
across
the
president
and
in
a
decided
tone
asked
her
to
sit
precisely
there
lee
looked
timidly
at
her
neighbour
who
made
no
sign
but
ate
his
supper
in
silence
only
broken
by
an
occasional
reply
to
a
rare
remark
lee
pitied
him
and
wondered
what
his
wife
would
say
when
they
reached
home
she
caught
ratcliffe
eye
down
the
table
watching
her
with
a
smile
she
tried
to
talk
fluently
with
dunbeg
but
not
until
supper
was
long
over
and
two
was
at
hand
not
until
the
presidential
party
under
all
the
proper
formalities
had
taken
their
leave
of
the
party
not
until
lord
skye
had
escorted
them
to
their
carriage
and
returned
to
say
that
they
were
gone
did
the
princess
loose
her
hold
upon
lee
and
allow
her
to
slip
away
into
obscurity
meanwhile
the
ball
had
gone
on
after
the
manner
of
balls
as
madeleine
sat
in
her
enforced
grandeur
she
could
watch
all
that
passed
she
had
seen
sybil
whirling
about
with
one
man
after
another
amid
a
swarm
of
dancers
enjoying
herself
to
the
utmost
and
occasionally
giving
a
nod
and
a
smile
to
her
sister
as
their
eyes
met
there
too
was
victoria
dare
who
never
appeared
flurried
even
when
waltzing
with
lord
dunbeg
whose
education
as
a
dancer
had
been
neglected
the
fact
was
now
fully
recognized
that
victoria
was
carrying
on
a
systematic
flirtation
with
dunbeg
and
had
undertaken
as
her
latest
duty
the
task
of
teaching
him
to
waltz
his
struggles
and
her
calmness
in
assisting
them
commanded
respect
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
by
the
republican
throne
lee
had
watched
ratcliffe
standing
by
the
president
who
appeared
unwilling
to
let
him
out
of
arm
length
and
who
seemed
to
make
to
him
most
of
his
few
remarks
schneidekoupon
and
his
sister
were
mixed
in
the
throng
dancing
as
though
england
had
never
countenanced
the
heresy
of
on
the
whole
lee
was
satisfied
if
her
own
sufferings
were
great
they
were
not
without
reward
she
studied
all
the
women
in
the
and
if
there
was
one
prettier
than
sybil
madeleine
eyes
could
not
discover
her
if
there
was
a
more
perfect
dress
madeleine
knew
nothing
of
dressing
on
these
points
she
felt
the
confidence
of
conviction
her
calm
would
have
been
complete
had
she
felt
quite
sure
that
none
of
sybil
gaiety
was
superficial
and
that
it
would
not
be
followed
by
reaction
she
watched
nervously
to
see
whether
her
face
changed
its
gay
expression
and
once
she
thought
it
became
depressed
but
this
was
when
the
came
up
to
claim
his
waltz
and
the
look
rapidly
passed
away
when
they
got
upon
the
floor
and
his
highness
began
to
wheel
round
the
room
with
a
precision
and
momentum
that
would
have
done
honour
to
a
regiment
of
life
guards
he
seemed
pleased
with
his
experiment
for
he
was
seen
again
and
again
careering
over
the
floor
with
sybil
until
lee
herself
became
nervous
for
the
princess
frowned
after
her
release
madeleine
lingered
awhile
in
the
to
speak
with
her
sister
and
to
receive
congratulations
for
half
an
hour
she
was
a
greater
belle
than
sybil
a
crowd
of
men
clustered
about
her
amused
at
the
part
she
had
played
in
the
evening
entertainment
and
full
of
compliments
upon
her
promotion
at
court
lord
skye
himself
found
time
to
offer
her
his
thanks
in
a
more
serious
tone
than
he
generally
affected
you
have
suffered
much
said
he
and
i
am
madeleine
laughed
as
she
answered
that
her
sufferings
had
seemed
nothing
to
her
while
she
watched
his
but
at
last
she
became
weary
of
the
noise
and
glare
of
the
and
accepting
the
arm
of
her
excellent
friend
count
popoff
she
strolled
with
him
back
to
the
house
there
at
last
she
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
quiet
where
the
light
was
less
strong
and
where
a
convenient
laurel
spread
its
leaves
in
front
so
as
to
make
a
bower
through
which
she
could
see
the
without
being
seen
by
them
except
with
an
effort
had
she
been
a
younger
woman
this
would
have
been
the
spot
for
a
flirtation
but
lee
never
flirted
and
the
idea
of
her
flirting
with
popoff
would
have
seemed
ludicrous
to
all
mankind
he
did
not
sit
down
but
was
leaning
against
the
angle
of
the
wall
talking
with
her
when
suddenly
ratcliffe
appeared
and
took
the
seat
by
her
side
with
such
deliberation
and
apparent
sense
of
property
that
popoff
incontinently
turned
and
fled
no
one
knew
where
the
secretary
came
from
or
how
he
learned
that
she
was
there
he
made
no
explanation
and
she
took
care
to
ask
for
none
she
gave
him
a
account
of
her
evening
service
as
which
he
matched
by
that
of
his
own
trials
as
to
the
president
who
it
seemed
had
clung
desperately
to
his
old
enemy
in
the
absence
of
any
other
rock
to
clutch
at
ratcliffe
looked
the
character
of
prime
minister
sufficiently
well
at
this
moment
he
would
have
held
his
own
at
a
pinch
in
any
court
not
merely
in
europe
but
in
india
or
china
where
dignity
is
still
expected
of
gentlemen
excepting
for
a
certain
coarse
and
animal
expression
about
the
mouth
and
an
indefinable
coldness
in
the
eye
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
still
in
his
prime
every
one
remarked
how
much
he
was
improved
since
entering
the
cabinet
he
had
dropped
his
senatorial
manner
his
clothes
were
no
longer
congressional
but
those
of
a
respectable
man
neat
and
decent
his
shirts
no
longer
protruded
in
the
wrong
places
nor
were
his
frayed
or
soiled
his
hair
did
not
stray
over
his
eyes
ears
and
coat
like
that
of
a
scotch
terrier
but
had
got
itself
cut
having
overheard
lee
express
on
one
occasion
her
opinion
of
people
who
did
not
take
a
cold
bath
every
morning
he
had
thought
it
best
to
adopt
this
reform
although
he
would
not
have
had
it
generally
known
tot
it
savoured
of
caste
he
made
an
effort
not
to
be
dictatorial
and
to
forget
that
he
had
been
the
prairie
giant
the
bully
of
the
senate
in
short
what
with
lee
influence
and
what
with
his
emancipation
from
the
senate
chamber
with
its
code
of
bad
manners
and
worse
morals
ratcliffe
was
fast
becoming
a
respectable
member
of
society
whom
a
man
who
had
never
been
in
prison
or
in
politics
might
safely
acknowledge
as
a
friend
ratcliffe
was
now
evidently
bent
upon
being
heard
after
charting
for
a
time
with
some
humour
on
the
president
successes
as
a
man
of
fashion
he
changed
the
subject
to
the
merits
of
the
president
as
a
statesman
and
little
by
little
as
he
spoke
he
became
serious
and
his
voice
sank
into
low
and
confidential
tones
he
plainly
said
that
the
president
incapacity
had
now
become
notorious
among
his
followers
that
it
was
only
with
difficulty
his
cabinet
and
friends
could
prevent
him
from
making
a
fool
of
himself
fifty
times
a
day
that
all
the
party
leaders
who
had
occasion
to
deal
with
him
were
so
thoroughly
disgusted
that
the
cabinet
had
to
pass
its
time
in
trying
to
pacify
them
while
this
state
of
things
lasted
ratcliffe
own
influence
must
be
paramount
he
had
good
reason
to
know
that
if
the
presidential
election
were
to
take
place
this
year
nothing
could
prevent
his
nomination
and
election
even
at
three
years
distance
the
chances
in
his
favour
were
at
least
two
to
one
and
after
this
exordium
he
went
on
in
a
low
tone
with
increasing
earnestness
while
lee
sat
motionless
as
the
statue
of
agrippina
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
are
happy
in
political
life
i
am
a
politician
because
i
can
not
help
myself
it
is
the
trade
i
am
fittest
for
and
ambition
is
my
resource
to
make
it
tolerable
in
politics
we
can
not
keep
our
hands
clean
i
have
done
many
things
in
my
political
career
that
are
not
defensible
to
act
with
entire
honesty
and
one
should
always
live
in
a
pure
atmosphere
and
the
atmosphere
of
politics
is
impure
domestic
life
is
the
salvation
of
many
public
men
but
i
have
for
many
years
been
deprived
of
it
i
have
now
come
to
that
point
where
increasing
responsibilities
and
temptations
make
me
require
help
i
must
have
it
you
alone
can
give
it
to
me
you
are
kind
thoughtful
conscientious
cultivated
fitted
better
than
any
woman
i
ever
saw
for
public
duties
your
place
is
there
you
belong
among
those
who
exercise
an
influence
beyond
their
time
i
only
ask
you
to
take
the
place
which
is
this
desperate
appeal
to
lee
ambition
was
a
calculated
part
of
ratcliffe
scheme
he
was
well
aware
that
he
had
marked
high
game
and
that
in
proportion
to
this
height
must
be
the
power
of
his
lure
nor
was
he
embarrassed
because
lee
sat
still
and
pale
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
her
hands
twisted
together
in
her
lap
the
eagle
that
soars
highest
must
be
longer
in
descending
to
the
ground
than
the
sparrow
or
the
partridge
lee
had
a
thousand
things
to
think
about
in
this
brief
time
and
yet
she
found
that
she
could
not
think
at
all
a
succession
of
mere
images
and
fragments
of
thought
passed
rapidly
over
her
mind
and
her
will
exercised
no
control
upon
their
order
or
their
nature
one
of
these
fleeting
reflections
was
that
in
all
the
offers
of
marriage
she
had
ever
heard
this
was
the
most
unsentimental
and
businesslike
as
for
his
appeal
to
her
ambition
it
fell
quite
dead
upon
her
ear
but
a
woman
must
be
more
than
a
heroine
who
can
listen
to
flattery
so
evidently
sincere
from
a
man
who
is
among
men
without
being
affected
by
it
to
her
however
the
great
and
overpowering
fact
was
that
she
found
herself
unable
to
retreat
or
escape
her
tactics
were
disconcerted
her
temporary
barriers
beaten
down
the
offer
was
made
what
should
she
do
with
it
she
had
thought
for
months
on
this
subject
without
being
able
to
form
a
decision
what
hope
was
there
that
she
should
be
able
to
decide
now
in
a
at
a
minute
notice
when
as
occasionally
happens
the
conflicting
sentiments
prejudices
and
passions
of
a
lifetime
are
compressed
into
a
single
instant
they
sometimes
overcharge
the
mind
and
it
refuses
to
work
lee
sat
still
and
let
things
take
their
course
a
dangerous
expedient
as
thousands
of
women
have
learned
for
it
leaves
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
strong
will
bent
upon
mastery
the
music
from
the
did
not
stop
crowds
of
persons
passed
by
their
retreat
some
glanced
in
and
not
one
of
these
felt
a
doubt
what
was
going
on
there
an
unmistakeable
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
intensity
surrounded
the
pair
ratcliffe
eyes
were
fixed
upon
lee
and
hers
on
the
ground
neither
seemed
to
speak
or
to
stir
old
baron
jacobi
who
never
failed
to
see
everything
saw
this
as
he
went
by
and
ejaculated
a
foreign
oath
of
frightful
import
victoria
dare
saw
it
and
was
devoured
by
curiosity
to
such
a
point
as
to
be
hardly
capable
of
containing
herself
after
a
silence
which
seemed
interminable
ratcliffe
went
on
i
do
not
speak
of
my
own
feelings
because
i
know
that
unless
compelled
by
a
strong
sense
of
duty
you
will
not
be
decided
by
any
devotion
of
mine
but
i
honestly
say
that
i
have
learned
to
depend
on
you
to
a
degree
i
can
hardly
express
and
when
i
think
of
what
i
should
be
without
you
life
seems
to
me
so
intolerably
dark
that
i
am
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
accept
any
conditions
that
will
keep
you
by
my
meanwhile
victoria
dare
although
deeply
interested
in
what
dunbeg
was
telling
her
had
met
sybil
and
had
stopped
a
single
second
to
whisper
in
her
ear
you
had
better
look
after
your
sister
in
the
window
behind
the
laurel
with
ratcliffe
sybil
was
on
lord
skye
arm
enjoying
herself
amazingly
though
the
night
was
far
gone
but
when
she
caught
victoria
words
the
expression
of
her
face
wholly
changed
all
the
anxieties
and
terrors
of
the
last
fortnight
came
back
upon
it
she
dragged
lord
skye
across
the
hall
and
looked
in
upon
her
sister
one
glance
was
enough
desperately
frightened
but
afraid
to
hesitate
she
went
directly
up
to
madeleine
who
was
still
sitting
like
a
statue
listening
to
last
words
as
she
hurriedly
entered
lee
looking
up
caught
sight
of
her
pale
face
and
started
from
her
seat
are
you
ill
sybil
she
exclaimed
is
anything
the
matter
a
little
fatigued
gasped
sybil
i
thought
you
might
be
ready
to
go
i
am
cried
madeleine
i
am
quite
ready
good
evening
ratcliffe
i
will
see
you
lord
skye
shall
i
take
leave
of
the
princess
the
princess
retired
half
an
hour
ago
replied
lord
skye
who
saw
the
situation
and
was
quite
ready
to
help
sybil
let
me
take
you
to
the
and
order
your
ratcliffe
found
himself
suddenly
left
alone
while
lee
hurried
away
torn
by
fresh
anxieties
they
had
reached
the
and
were
nearly
ready
to
go
home
when
victoria
dare
suddenly
dashed
in
upon
them
with
an
animation
of
manner
very
unusual
in
her
and
seizing
sybil
by
the
hand
drew
her
into
an
adjoining
room
and
shut
the
door
can
you
keep
a
secret
said
she
abruptly
what
said
sybil
looking
at
her
with
interest
you
do
mean
are
you
really
tell
me
quick
yes
said
victoria
relapsing
into
composure
i
am
engaged
to
lord
dunbeg
victoria
nodded
and
sybil
whose
nerves
were
strung
to
the
highest
pitch
by
excitement
flattery
fatigue
perplexity
and
terror
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
laughter
that
startled
even
the
calm
miss
dare
poor
lord
dunbeg
do
be
hard
on
him
victoria
she
gasped
when
at
last
she
found
breath
do
you
really
mean
to
pass
the
rest
of
your
life
in
ireland
oh
how
much
you
will
teach
them
you
forget
my
dear
said
victoria
who
had
placidly
enthroned
herself
on
the
foot
of
a
bed
that
i
am
not
a
pauper
i
am
told
that
dunbeg
castle
is
a
romantic
summer
residence
and
in
the
dull
season
we
shall
of
course
go
to
london
or
somewhere
i
shall
be
civil
to
you
when
you
come
over
do
you
think
a
coronet
will
look
well
on
me
sybil
burst
again
into
laughter
so
irrepressible
and
prolonged
that
it
puzzled
even
poor
dunbeg
who
was
impatiently
pacing
the
corridor
outside
it
alarmed
madeleine
who
suddenly
opened
the
door
sybil
recovered
herself
and
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
presented
victoria
to
her
sister
madeleine
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
the
countess
dunbeg
but
lee
was
much
too
anxious
to
feel
any
interest
in
lady
dunbeg
a
sudden
fear
struck
her
that
sybil
was
going
into
hysterics
because
victoria
engagement
recalled
her
own
disappointment
she
hurried
her
sister
away
to
the
carriage
chapter
xii
they
drove
home
in
silence
lee
disturbed
with
anxieties
and
doubts
partly
caused
by
her
sister
partly
by
ratcliffe
sybil
divided
between
amusement
at
victoria
conquest
and
alarm
at
her
own
boldness
in
meddling
with
her
sister
affairs
desperation
however
was
stronger
than
fear
she
made
up
her
mind
that
further
suspense
was
not
to
be
endured
she
would
fight
her
baffle
now
before
another
hour
was
lost
surely
no
time
could
be
better
a
few
moments
brought
them
to
their
door
lee
had
told
her
maid
not
to
wait
for
them
and
they
were
alone
the
fire
was
still
alive
on
madeleine
hearth
and
she
threw
more
wood
upon
it
then
she
insisted
that
sybil
must
go
to
bed
at
once
but
sybil
refused
she
felt
quite
well
she
said
and
not
in
the
least
sleepy
she
had
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
and
wanted
to
get
it
off
her
mind
nevertheless
her
feminine
regard
for
the
dawn
in
june
led
her
to
postpone
what
she
had
to
say
until
with
madeleine
help
she
had
laid
the
triumph
of
the
ball
carefully
aside
then
putting
on
her
and
hastily
plunging
carrington
letter
into
her
breast
like
a
concealed
weapon
she
hurried
back
to
madeleine
room
and
established
herself
in
a
chair
before
the
fire
there
after
a
pause
the
two
women
began
their
trial
of
strength
in
which
the
match
was
so
nearly
equal
as
to
make
the
result
doubtful
for
if
madeleine
were
much
the
cleverer
sybil
in
this
case
knew
much
better
what
she
wanted
and
had
a
clear
idea
how
she
meant
to
gain
it
while
madeleine
unsuspicious
of
attack
had
no
plan
of
defence
at
all
madeleine
began
sybil
solemnly
and
with
a
violent
palpitation
of
the
heart
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
is
it
my
child
said
lee
puzzled
and
yet
half
ready
to
see
that
there
must
be
some
connection
between
her
sister
coming
question
and
the
sudden
illness
at
the
ball
which
had
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
it
came
do
you
mean
to
marry
ratcliffe
poor
lee
was
quite
disconcerted
by
the
directness
of
the
attack
this
fatal
question
met
her
at
every
turn
hardly
had
she
succeeded
in
escaping
trom
it
at
the
ball
scarcely
an
hour
ago
by
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
for
which
she
now
began
to
see
she
was
indebted
to
sybil
and
here
it
was
again
presented
to
her
face
like
a
pistol
the
whole
town
then
was
asking
it
ratcliffe
offer
must
have
been
seen
by
half
washington
and
her
reply
was
awaited
by
an
immense
audience
as
though
she
were
a
political
her
disgust
was
intense
and
her
first
answer
to
sybil
was
a
quick
inquiry
why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
have
you
heard
anything
has
anyone
talked
about
it
to
you
no
replied
sybil
but
i
must
know
i
can
see
for
myself
without
being
told
that
racliffe
is
trying
to
make
you
marry
him
i
ask
out
of
curiosity
this
is
something
that
concerns
me
nearly
as
much
as
it
does
you
yourself
please
tell
me
do
treat
me
like
a
child
any
longer
let
me
know
what
you
are
thinking
about
i
am
so
tired
of
being
left
in
the
dark
you
have
no
idea
how
much
this
thing
weighs
on
me
oh
maude
i
shall
never
be
happy
again
until
you
trust
me
about
lee
felt
a
little
pang
of
conscience
and
seemed
suddenly
to
become
conscious
of
a
new
coil
tightening
about
her
in
this
wretched
complication
unable
to
see
her
way
ignorant
of
her
sister
motives
urged
on
by
the
idea
that
sybil
happiness
was
involved
she
was
now
charged
with
want
of
feeling
and
called
upon
for
a
direct
answer
to
a
plain
question
how
could
she
aver
that
she
did
not
mean
to
marry
ratcliffe
to
say
this
would
be
to
shut
the
door
on
all
the
objects
she
had
at
heart
if
a
direct
answer
must
be
given
it
was
better
to
say
yes
and
have
it
over
better
to
leap
blindly
and
see
what
came
of
it
lee
therefore
with
an
internal
gasp
but
with
no
visible
sign
of
excitement
said
as
though
she
were
in
a
dream
well
sybil
i
will
tell
you
i
would
have
told
you
long
ago
if
i
had
known
myself
yes
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
ratcliffe
sybil
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
cry
and
have
you
told
him
so
she
asked
no
you
came
and
interrupted
us
just
as
we
were
speaking
i
was
glad
you
did
come
for
it
gives
me
a
little
time
to
think
but
i
am
decided
now
i
shall
tell
him
this
was
not
said
with
the
air
or
one
whose
heart
beat
warmly
at
the
thought
of
confessing
her
love
lee
spoke
mechanically
and
almost
with
an
effort
sybil
flung
herself
with
all
her
energy
upon
her
sister
violently
excited
and
eager
to
make
herself
heard
without
waiting
for
arguments
she
broke
out
into
a
torrent
of
entreaties
oh
do
do
do
oh
please
please
do
my
dearest
dearest
maude
unless
you
want
to
break
my
heart
do
marry
that
man
you
ca
love
him
you
can
never
be
happy
with
him
he
will
take
you
away
to
peonia
and
you
will
die
there
i
shall
never
see
you
again
he
will
make
you
unhappy
he
will
beat
you
i
know
he
will
oh
if
you
care
for
me
at
all
do
marry
him
send
him
away
do
see
him
again
let
us
go
ourselves
now
in
the
morning
train
before
he
comes
back
all
ready
i
pack
everything
for
you
we
go
to
newport
to
europe
anywhere
to
be
out
of
his
reach
with
this
passionate
appeal
sybil
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
her
sister
side
and
clasping
her
arms
around
madeleine
waist
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
were
already
broken
had
carrington
seen
her
then
he
must
have
admitted
that
she
had
carried
out
his
instructions
to
the
letter
she
was
quite
honest
too
in
it
all
she
meant
what
she
said
and
her
tears
were
real
tears
that
had
been
pent
up
for
weeks
unluckily
her
logic
was
feeble
her
idea
of
ratcliffe
character
was
vague
and
biased
by
mere
theories
of
what
a
prairie
giant
of
peonia
should
be
in
his
domestic
relations
her
idea
of
peonia
too
was
indistinct
she
was
haunted
by
a
vision
of
her
sister
sitting
on
a
sofa
before
an
iron
stove
in
a
small
room
with
high
bare
white
walls
a
chromolithograph
on
each
and
at
her
side
a
table
surmounted
by
a
glass
vase
containing
funereal
dried
grasses
the
only
literature
frank
leslie
periodical
and
the
new
york
ledger
with
a
strong
smell
of
cooking
everywhere
prevalent
here
she
saw
madeleine
receiving
visitors
the
wives
of
neighbours
and
constituents
who
told
her
the
peonia
news
notwithstanding
her
ignorant
and
unreasonable
prejudice
against
western
men
and
women
western
towns
and
prairies
and
in
short
everything
western
down
to
western
politics
and
western
politicians
whom
she
perversely
asserted
to
be
tue
lowest
ot
all
western
products
there
was
still
some
common
sense
in
sybil
idea
when
that
inevitable
hour
struck
for
ratcliffe
which
strikes
sooner
or
later
for
all
politicians
and
an
ungrateful
country
permitted
him
to
pine
among
his
friends
in
illinois
what
did
he
propose
to
do
with
his
wife
did
he
seriously
suppose
that
she
who
was
bored
to
death
by
new
york
and
had
been
able
to
find
no
permanent
pleasure
in
europe
would
live
quietly
in
the
romantic
village
of
peonia
if
not
did
ratcliffe
imagine
that
they
could
find
happiness
in
the
enjoyment
of
each
other
society
and
of
income
in
the
excitements
of
washington
in
the
ardour
of
his
pursuit
ratcliffe
had
accepted
in
advance
any
conditions
which
lee
might
impose
but
if
he
really
imagined
that
happiness
and
content
lay
on
the
purple
rim
of
this
sunset
he
had
more
confidence
in
women
and
in
money
than
a
wider
experience
was
ever
likely
to
justify
whatever
might
be
ratcliffe
schemes
for
dealing
with
these
obstacles
they
could
hardly
be
such
as
would
satisfy
sybil
who
if
inaccurate
in
her
theories
about
prairie
giants
yet
understood
women
and
especially
her
sister
much
better
than
ratcliffe
ever
could
do
here
she
was
safe
and
it
would
have
been
better
had
she
said
no
more
for
lee
though
staggered
for
a
moment
by
her
sister
vehemence
was
reassured
by
what
seemed
the
absurdity
of
her
fears
madeleine
rebelled
against
this
hysterical
violence
of
opposition
and
became
more
fixed
in
her
decision
she
scolded
her
sister
in
good
set
terms
sybil
sybil
you
must
not
be
so
violent
behave
like
a
woman
and
not
like
a
spoiled
child
lee
like
most
persons
who
have
to
deal
with
spoiled
or
unspoiled
children
resorted
to
severity
not
so
much
because
it
was
the
proper
way
of
dealing
with
them
as
because
she
knew
not
what
else
to
do
she
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
and
weary
she
was
not
satisfied
with
herself
or
with
her
own
motives
doubt
encompassed
her
on
all
sides
and
her
worst
opponent
was
that
sister
whose
happiness
had
turned
the
scale
against
her
own
judgment
nevertheless
her
tactics
answered
their
object
of
checking
vehemence
her
sobs
came
to
an
end
and
she
presently
rose
with
a
quieter
air
madeleine
said
she
do
you
really
want
to
marry
ratcliffe
what
else
can
i
do
my
dear
sybil
i
want
to
do
whatever
is
for
the
best
i
thought
you
might
be
you
thought
i
might
be
pleased
cried
sybil
in
astonishment
what
a
strange
idea
if
you
had
ever
spoken
to
me
about
it
i
should
have
told
you
that
i
hate
him
and
ca
understand
how
you
can
abide
him
but
i
would
rather
marry
him
myself
than
see
you
marry
him
i
know
that
you
will
kill
yourself
with
unhappiness
when
you
have
done
it
oh
maude
please
tell
me
that
you
wo
and
sybil
began
gently
sobbing
again
while
she
caressed
her
sister
lee
was
infinitely
distressed
to
act
against
the
wishes
of
her
nearest
friends
was
hard
enough
but
to
appear
harsh
and
unfeeling
to
the
one
being
whose
happiness
she
had
at
heart
was
intolerable
yet
no
sensible
woman
after
saying
that
she
meant
to
marry
a
man
like
ratcliffe
could
throw
him
over
merely
because
another
woman
chose
to
behave
like
a
spoiled
child
sybil
was
more
childish
than
madeleine
herself
had
supposed
she
could
not
even
see
where
her
own
interest
lay
she
knew
no
more
about
ratcliffe
and
the
west
than
if
he
were
the
giant
of
a
and
lived
at
the
top
of
a
she
must
be
treated
as
a
child
with
gentleness
affection
forbearance
but
with
firmness
and
decision
she
must
be
refused
what
she
asked
for
her
own
good
thus
it
came
about
that
at
last
lee
spoke
with
an
appearance
of
decision
far
from
representing
her
internal
tremor
sybil
dear
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
marry
ratcliffe
because
there
is
no
other
way
of
making
every
one
happy
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
him
he
is
kind
and
generous
besides
i
can
take
care
of
myself
and
i
will
take
care
of
you
too
now
let
us
not
discuss
it
any
more
it
is
broad
daylight
and
we
are
both
tired
sybil
grew
at
once
perfectly
calm
and
standing
before
her
sister
as
though
their
rôles
were
henceforward
to
be
reversed
said
you
have
really
made
up
your
mind
then
nothing
i
can
say
will
change
it
lee
looking
at
her
with
more
surprise
than
ever
could
not
force
herself
to
speak
but
she
shook
her
head
slowly
and
decidedly
then
said
sybil
there
is
only
one
thing
more
i
can
do
you
must
read
this
and
she
drew
out
carrington
letter
which
she
held
before
madeleine
face
not
now
sybil
remonstrated
lee
dreading
another
long
struggle
i
will
read
it
after
we
have
had
some
rest
go
to
bed
now
i
do
not
leave
this
room
nor
will
i
ever
go
to
bed
until
you
have
read
that
letter
answered
sybil
seating
herself
again
before
the
fire
with
the
resolution
of
queen
elizabeth
not
if
i
sit
here
till
you
are
married
i
promised
carrington
that
you
should
read
it
instantly
it
all
i
can
do
with
a
sigh
lee
drew
up
the
and
in
the
gray
morning
light
sat
down
to
break
the
seal
and
read
the
following
letter
washington
april
my
dear
lee
this
letter
will
only
come
into
your
hands
in
case
there
should
be
a
necessity
for
your
knowing
its
contents
nothing
short
of
necessity
would
excuse
my
writing
it
i
have
to
ask
your
pardon
for
intruding
again
upon
your
private
affairs
in
this
case
if
i
did
not
intrude
you
would
have
cause
for
serious
complaint
against
me
you
asked
me
the
other
day
whether
i
knew
anything
against
ratcliffe
which
the
world
did
not
know
to
account
for
my
low
opinion
of
his
character
i
evaded
your
question
then
i
was
bound
by
professional
rules
not
to
disclose
facts
that
came
to
me
under
a
pledge
of
confidence
i
am
going
to
violate
these
rules
now
only
because
i
owe
you
a
duty
which
seems
to
me
to
override
all
others
i
do
know
facts
in
regard
to
ratcliffe
which
have
seemed
to
me
to
warrant
a
very
low
opinion
of
his
character
and
to
mark
him
as
unfit
to
be
i
will
not
say
your
husband
but
even
your
acquaintance
you
know
that
i
am
executor
to
samuel
baker
will
you
know
who
samuel
baker
was
you
have
seen
his
wife
she
has
told
you
herself
that
i
assisted
her
in
the
examination
and
destruction
of
all
her
private
papers
according
to
his
special
request
one
of
the
first
facts
i
learned
from
these
papers
and
her
explanations
was
the
following
just
eight
years
ago
the
great
mail
steamship
company
wished
to
extend
its
service
round
the
world
and
in
order
to
do
so
it
applied
to
congress
for
a
heavy
subsidy
the
management
of
this
affair
was
put
into
the
hands
of
baker
and
all
his
private
letters
to
the
president
of
the
company
in
press
copies
as
well
as
the
replies
came
into
my
possession
baker
letters
were
of
course
written
in
a
sort
of
cypher
several
kinds
of
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
using
he
left
among
his
papers
a
key
to
this
cypher
but
baker
could
have
explained
it
without
that
help
it
appeared
from
this
correspondence
that
the
bill
was
carried
successfully
through
the
house
and
on
reaching
the
senate
was
referred
to
the
appropriate
committee
its
ultimate
passage
was
very
doubtful
the
end
of
the
session
was
close
at
hand
the
senate
was
very
evenly
divided
and
the
chairman
of
the
committee
was
decidedly
hostile
the
chairman
of
that
committee
was
senator
ratcliffe
always
mentioned
by
baker
in
cypher
and
with
every
precaution
if
you
care
however
to
verify
the
fact
and
to
trace
the
history
of
the
subsidy
bill
through
all
its
stages
together
with
ratcliffe
report
remarks
and
votes
upon
it
you
have
only
to
look
into
the
journals
and
debates
for
that
year
at
last
baker
wrote
that
senator
ratcliffe
had
put
the
bill
in
his
pocket
and
unless
some
means
could
be
found
of
overcoming
his
opposition
there
would
be
no
report
and
the
bill
would
never
come
to
a
vote
all
ordinary
kinds
of
argument
and
influence
had
been
employed
upon
him
and
were
exhausted
in
this
exigency
baker
suggested
that
the
company
should
give
him
authority
to
see
what
money
would
do
but
he
added
that
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
to
deal
with
small
sums
unless
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
could
be
employed
it
was
better
to
leave
the
thing
alone
the
next
mail
authorized
him
to
use
any
required
amount
of
money
not
exceeding
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
two
days
later
he
wrote
that
the
bill
was
reported
and
would
pass
the
senate
within
hours
and
he
congratulated
the
company
on
the
fact
that
he
had
used
only
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
out
of
its
last
credit
the
bill
was
actually
reported
passed
and
became
law
as
he
foretold
and
the
company
has
enjoyed
its
subsidy
ever
since
baker
also
informed
me
that
to
her
knowledge
her
husband
gave
the
sum
mentioned
in
united
states
coupon
bonds
to
senator
ratcliffe
this
transaction
taken
in
connection
with
the
tortuousness
of
his
public
course
explains
the
distrust
i
have
always
expressed
for
him
you
will
however
understand
that
all
these
papers
have
been
destroyed
baker
could
never
be
induced
to
hazard
her
own
comfort
by
revealing
the
facts
to
the
public
the
officers
of
the
company
in
their
own
interests
would
never
betray
the
transaction
and
their
books
were
undoubtedly
so
kept
as
to
show
no
trace
of
it
if
i
made
this
charge
against
ratcliffe
i
should
be
the
only
sufferer
he
would
deny
and
laugh
at
it
i
could
prove
nothing
i
am
therefore
more
directly
interested
than
he
is
in
keeping
silence
in
trusting
this
secret
to
you
i
rely
firmly
upon
your
mentioning
it
to
no
one
else
not
even
to
your
sister
you
are
at
liberty
if
you
wish
to
show
this
letter
to
one
person
only
to
ratcliffe
himself
that
done
you
will
i
beg
burn
it
immediately
with
the
warmest
good
wishes
i
am
ever
most
truly
yours
john
when
lee
had
finished
reading
this
letter
she
remained
for
some
time
quite
silent
looking
out
into
the
square
below
the
morning
had
come
and
the
sky
was
bright
with
the
fresh
april
sunlight
she
threw
open
her
window
and
drew
in
the
soft
spring
air
she
needed
all
the
purity
and
quiet
that
nature
could
give
for
her
whole
soul
was
in
revolt
wounded
mortified
exasperated
against
the
sentiment
of
all
her
friends
she
had
insisted
upon
believing
in
this
man
she
had
wrought
herself
up
to
the
point
of
accepting
him
for
her
husband
a
man
who
if
law
were
the
same
thing
as
justice
ought
to
be
in
a
felon
cell
a
man
who
could
take
money
to
betray
his
trust
her
anger
at
first
swept
away
all
bounds
she
was
impatient
for
the
moment
when
she
should
see
him
again
and
tear
off
his
mask
for
once
she
would
express
all
the
loathing
she
felt
for
the
whole
pack
of
political
hounds
she
would
see
whether
the
animal
was
made
like
other
beings
whether
he
had
a
sense
of
honour
a
single
clean
spot
in
his
mind
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
after
all
there
might
be
a
mistake
perhaps
ratcliffe
could
explain
the
charge
away
but
this
thought
only
laid
bare
another
smarting
wound
in
her
pride
not
only
did
she
believe
the
charge
but
she
believed
that
ratcliffe
would
defend
his
act
she
had
been
willing
to
marry
a
man
whom
she
thought
capable
of
such
a
crime
and
now
she
shuddered
at
the
idea
that
this
charge
might
have
been
brought
against
her
husband
and
that
she
could
not
dismiss
it
with
instant
incredulity
with
indignant
contempt
how
had
this
happened
how
had
she
got
into
so
foul
a
complication
when
she
left
new
york
she
had
meant
to
be
a
mere
spectator
in
washington
had
it
entered
her
head
that
she
could
be
drawn
into
any
project
of
a
second
marriage
she
never
would
have
come
at
all
for
she
was
proud
of
her
loyalty
to
her
husband
memory
and
second
marriages
were
her
abhorrence
in
her
restlessness
and
solitude
she
had
forgotten
this
she
had
only
asked
whether
any
life
was
worth
living
for
a
woman
who
had
neither
husband
nor
children
was
the
family
all
that
life
had
to
offer
could
she
find
no
interest
outside
the
household
and
so
led
by
this
she
had
with
her
eyes
open
walked
into
the
quagmire
of
politics
in
spite
of
remonstrance
in
spite
of
conscience
she
rose
and
paced
the
room
while
sybil
lay
on
the
couch
watching
her
with
eyes
half
shut
she
grew
more
and
more
angry
with
herself
and
as
her
increased
her
anger
against
ratcliffe
faded
away
she
had
no
right
to
be
angry
with
ratcliffe
he
had
never
deceived
her
he
had
always
openly
enough
avowed
that
he
knew
no
code
of
morals
in
politics
that
if
virtue
did
not
answer
his
purpose
he
used
vice
how
could
she
blame
him
for
acts
which
he
had
repeatedly
defended
in
her
presence
and
with
her
tacit
assent
on
principles
that
warranted
this
or
any
other
villainy
the
worst
was
that
this
discovery
had
come
on
her
as
a
blow
not
as
a
reprieve
from
execution
at
this
thought
she
became
furious
with
herself
she
had
not
known
the
recesses
of
her
own
heart
she
had
honestly
supposed
that
sybil
interests
and
sybil
happiness
were
forcing
her
to
an
act
of
and
now
she
saw
that
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
very
different
motives
had
been
at
work
ambition
thirst
for
power
restless
eagerness
to
meddle
in
what
did
not
concern
her
blind
longing
to
escape
from
the
torture
of
watching
other
women
with
full
lives
and
satisfied
instincts
while
her
own
life
was
hungry
and
sad
for
a
time
she
had
actually
unconscious
as
she
was
of
the
delusion
hugged
a
hope
that
a
new
field
of
usefulness
was
open
to
her
that
great
opportunities
for
doing
good
were
to
supply
the
aching
emptiness
of
that
good
which
had
been
taken
away
and
that
here
at
last
was
an
object
for
which
there
would
be
almost
a
pleasure
in
squandering
the
rest
of
existence
even
if
she
knew
in
advance
that
the
experiment
would
fail
life
was
emptier
than
ever
now
that
this
dream
was
over
yet
the
worst
was
not
in
that
disappointment
but
in
the
discovery
of
her
own
weakness
and
worn
out
by
anxiety
excitement
and
sleeplessness
she
was
unfit
to
struggle
with
the
creatures
of
her
own
imagination
such
a
strain
could
only
end
in
a
nervous
crisis
and
at
length
it
came
oh
what
a
vile
thing
life
is
she
cried
throwing
up
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
helpless
rage
and
despair
oh
how
i
wish
i
were
dead
how
i
wish
the
universe
were
annihilated
and
she
flung
herself
down
by
sybil
side
in
a
frenzy
of
tears
sybil
who
had
watched
all
this
exhibition
in
silence
waited
quietly
for
the
excitement
to
pass
there
was
little
to
say
she
could
only
soothe
after
the
paroxysm
had
exhausted
itself
madeleine
lay
quiet
for
a
time
until
other
thoughts
began
to
disturb
her
from
reproaching
herself
about
ratcliffe
she
went
on
to
reproach
herself
about
sybil
who
really
looked
worn
and
pale
as
though
almost
overcome
by
fatigue
sybil
said
she
you
must
go
to
bed
at
once
you
are
tired
out
it
was
very
wrong
in
me
to
let
you
sit
up
so
late
go
now
and
get
some
i
am
not
going
to
bed
till
you
do
maude
replied
sybil
with
quiet
obstinacy
go
dear
it
is
all
settled
i
shall
not
marry
ratcliffe
you
need
not
be
anxious
about
it
any
are
you
very
unhappy
only
very
angry
with
myself
i
ought
to
have
taken
advice
oh
maude
exclaimed
sybil
with
a
sudden
explosion
of
energy
i
wish
you
had
taken
him
this
remark
roused
lee
to
new
interest
why
sybil
said
she
surely
you
are
not
in
earnest
indeed
i
am
replied
sybil
very
decidedly
i
know
you
think
i
am
in
love
with
carrington
myself
but
i
not
i
would
a
great
deal
rather
have
him
for
a
and
he
is
so
much
the
nicest
man
you
know
and
you
could
help
his
lee
hesitated
a
moment
for
she
was
not
quite
certain
whether
it
was
wise
to
probe
a
healing
wound
but
she
was
anxious
to
clear
this
last
weight
from
her
mind
and
she
dashed
recklessly
forward
are
you
sure
you
are
telling
the
truth
sybil
why
then
did
you
say
that
you
cared
for
him
and
why
have
you
been
so
miserable
ever
since
he
went
away
why
i
should
think
it
was
plain
enough
why
because
i
thought
as
every
one
else
did
that
you
were
going
to
marry
ratcliffe
and
because
if
you
married
ratcliffe
i
must
go
and
live
alone
and
because
you
treated
me
like
a
child
and
never
took
me
into
your
confidence
at
all
and
because
carrington
was
the
only
person
i
had
to
advise
me
and
after
he
went
away
i
was
left
all
alone
to
fight
ratcliffe
and
you
both
together
without
a
human
soul
to
help
me
in
case
i
made
a
mistake
you
would
have
been
a
great
deal
more
miserable
than
i
if
you
had
been
in
my
madeleine
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
doubt
would
this
last
did
sybil
herself
know
the
depth
of
her
own
wound
but
what
could
lee
do
now
perhaps
sybil
did
deceive
herself
a
little
when
this
excitement
had
passed
away
perhaps
carrington
image
might
recur
to
her
mind
a
little
too
often
for
her
own
comfort
the
future
must
take
care
of
itself
lee
drew
her
sister
closer
to
her
and
said
sybil
i
have
made
a
horrible
mistake
and
you
must
forgive
chapter
xiii
not
until
afternoon
did
lee
reappear
how
much
she
had
slept
she
did
not
say
and
she
hardly
looked
like
one
whose
slumbers
had
been
long
or
sweet
but
if
she
had
slept
little
she
had
made
up
for
the
loss
by
thinking
much
and
while
she
thought
the
storm
which
had
raged
so
fiercely
in
her
breast
more
and
more
subsided
into
calm
if
there
was
not
sunshine
yet
there
was
at
least
stillness
as
she
lay
hour
after
hour
waiting
for
the
sleep
that
did
not
come
she
had
at
first
the
keen
mortification
of
reflecting
how
easily
she
had
been
led
by
mere
vanity
into
imagining
that
she
could
be
of
use
in
the
world
she
even
smiled
in
her
solitude
at
the
picture
she
drew
of
herself
reforming
ratcliffe
and
krebs
and
schuyler
clinton
the
ease
with
which
ratcliffe
alone
had
twisted
her
about
his
finger
now
that
she
saw
it
made
her
writhe
and
the
thought
of
what
he
might
have
done
had
she
married
him
and
of
the
endless
succession
of
moral
somersaults
she
would
have
had
to
turn
chilled
her
with
mortal
terror
she
had
barely
escaped
being
dragged
under
the
wheels
of
the
machine
and
so
coming
to
an
untimely
end
when
she
thought
of
this
she
felt
a
mad
passion
to
revenge
herself
on
the
whole
race
of
politicians
with
ratcliffe
at
their
head
she
passed
hours
in
framing
bitter
speeches
to
be
made
to
his
face
then
as
she
grew
calmer
ratcliffe
sins
took
on
a
milder
hue
life
after
all
had
not
been
entirely
blackened
by
his
arts
there
was
even
some
good
in
her
experience
sharp
though
it
were
had
she
not
come
to
washington
in
search
of
men
who
cast
a
shadow
and
was
not
shadow
strong
enough
to
satisfy
her
had
she
not
penetrated
the
deepest
recesses
of
politics
and
learned
how
easily
the
mere
possession
of
power
could
convert
the
shadow
of
a
existing
only
in
the
brain
of
a
foolish
country
farmer
into
a
lurid
nightmare
that
convulsed
the
sleep
of
nations
the
antics
of
presidents
and
senators
had
been
amusing
so
amusing
that
she
had
nearly
been
persuaded
to
take
part
in
them
she
had
saved
herself
in
time
she
had
got
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
of
democratic
government
and
found
out
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
government
of
any
other
kind
she
might
have
known
it
by
her
own
common
sense
but
now
that
experience
had
proved
it
she
was
glad
to
quit
the
masquerade
to
return
to
the
true
democracy
of
life
her
paupers
and
her
prisons
her
schools
and
her
hospitals
as
for
ratcliffe
she
felt
no
difficulty
in
dealing
with
him
let
ratcliffe
and
his
brother
giants
wander
on
their
own
political
prairie
and
hunt
for
offices
or
other
profitable
game
as
they
would
their
objects
were
not
her
objects
and
to
join
their
company
was
not
her
ambition
she
was
no
longer
very
angry
with
ratcliffe
she
had
no
wish
to
insult
him
or
to
quarrel
with
him
what
he
had
done
as
a
politician
he
had
done
according
to
his
own
moral
code
and
it
was
not
her
business
to
judge
him
to
protect
herself
was
the
only
right
she
claimed
she
thought
she
could
easily
hold
him
at
arm
length
and
although
if
carrington
had
written
the
truth
they
could
never
again
be
friends
there
need
be
no
difficulty
in
their
remaining
acquaintances
if
this
view
of
her
duty
was
narrow
it
was
at
least
proof
that
she
had
learned
something
from
ratcliffe
perhaps
it
was
also
proof
that
she
had
yet
to
learn
ratcliffe
himself
two
had
struck
before
lee
came
down
from
her
chamber
and
sybil
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
madeleine
rang
her
bell
and
gave
orders
that
if
ratcliffe
called
she
would
see
him
but
she
was
at
home
to
no
one
else
then
she
sat
down
to
write
letters
and
to
prepare
for
her
journey
to
new
york
for
she
must
now
hasten
her
departure
in
order
to
escape
the
gossip
and
criticism
which
she
saw
hanging
like
an
avalanche
over
her
head
when
sybil
at
length
came
down
looking
much
fresher
than
her
sister
they
passed
an
hour
together
arranging
this
and
other
small
matters
so
that
both
of
them
were
again
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
sybil
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
a
number
of
visitors
came
to
the
door
that
day
some
of
them
prompted
by
friendliness
and
some
by
sheer
curiosity
for
lee
abrupt
disappearance
from
the
ball
had
excited
remark
against
all
these
her
door
was
firmly
closed
on
the
other
hand
as
the
afternoon
went
on
she
sent
sybil
away
so
that
she
might
have
the
field
entirely
to
herself
and
sybil
relieved
of
all
her
alarms
sallied
out
to
interrupt
latest
interview
with
his
countess
and
to
amuse
herself
with
last
towards
four
the
tall
form
of
ratcliffe
was
seen
to
issue
from
the
treasury
department
and
to
descend
the
broad
steps
of
its
western
front
turning
deliberately
towards
the
square
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
crossed
the
avenue
and
stopping
at
lee
door
rang
the
bell
he
was
immediately
admitted
lee
was
alone
in
her
parlour
and
rose
rather
gravely
as
he
entered
but
welcomed
him
as
cordially
as
she
could
she
wanted
to
put
an
end
to
his
hopes
at
once
and
to
do
it
decisively
but
without
hurting
his
feelings
mr
ratcliffe
said
she
when
he
was
seated
i
am
sure
you
will
be
better
pleased
by
my
speaking
instantly
and
frankly
i
could
not
reply
to
you
last
night
i
will
do
so
now
without
delay
what
you
wish
is
impossible
i
would
rather
not
even
discuss
it
let
us
leave
it
here
and
return
to
our
old
she
could
not
force
herself
to
express
any
sense
of
gratitude
for
his
affection
or
of
regret
at
being
obliged
to
meet
it
with
so
little
return
to
treat
him
with
tolerable
civility
was
all
she
thought
required
of
her
ratcliffe
felt
the
change
of
manner
he
had
been
prepared
for
a
struggle
but
not
to
be
met
with
so
blunt
a
rebuff
at
the
start
his
look
became
serious
and
he
hesitated
a
moment
before
speaking
but
when
he
spoke
at
last
it
was
with
a
manner
as
firm
and
decided
as
that
of
lee
herself
i
can
not
accept
such
an
answer
i
will
not
say
that
i
have
a
right
to
explanation
i
have
no
rights
which
you
are
bound
to
respect
but
from
you
i
conceive
that
i
may
at
least
ask
the
favour
of
one
and
that
you
will
not
refuse
it
are
you
willing
to
tell
me
your
reasons
for
this
abrupt
and
harsh
decision
i
do
not
dispute
your
right
of
explanation
ratcliffe
you
have
the
right
if
you
choose
to
use
it
and
i
am
ready
to
give
you
every
explanation
in
my
power
but
i
hope
you
will
not
insist
on
my
doing
so
if
i
seemed
to
speak
abruptly
and
harshly
it
was
merely
to
spare
you
the
greater
annoyance
of
doubt
since
i
am
forced
to
give
you
pain
was
it
not
fairer
and
more
respectful
to
you
to
speak
at
once
we
have
been
friends
i
am
very
soon
going
away
i
sincerely
want
to
avoid
saying
or
doing
anything
that
would
change
our
ratcliffe
however
paid
no
attention
to
these
words
and
gave
them
no
answer
he
was
much
too
old
a
debater
to
be
misled
by
such
trifles
when
he
needed
all
his
faculties
to
pin
his
opponent
to
the
wall
he
asked
is
your
decision
a
new
one
it
is
a
very
old
one
ratcliffe
which
i
had
let
myself
lose
sight
of
for
a
time
a
night
reflection
has
brought
me
back
to
may
i
ask
why
you
have
returned
to
it
surely
you
would
not
have
hesitated
without
strong
i
will
tell
you
frankly
if
by
appearing
to
hesitate
i
have
misled
you
i
am
honestly
sorry
for
it
i
did
not
mean
to
do
it
my
hesitation
was
owing
to
the
doubt
whether
my
life
might
not
really
be
best
used
in
aiding
you
my
decision
was
owing
to
the
certainty
that
we
are
not
fitted
for
each
other
our
lives
run
in
separate
grooves
we
are
both
too
old
to
change
ratcliffe
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
relief
your
reasons
lee
are
not
sound
there
is
no
such
divergence
in
our
lives
on
the
contrary
i
can
give
to
yours
the
field
it
needs
and
that
it
can
get
in
no
other
way
while
you
can
give
to
mine
everything
it
now
wants
if
these
are
your
only
reasons
i
am
sure
of
being
able
to
remove
madeleine
looked
as
though
she
were
not
altogether
pleased
at
this
idea
and
became
a
little
dogmatic
it
is
no
use
our
arguing
on
this
subject
ratcliffe
you
and
i
take
very
different
views
of
life
i
can
not
accept
yours
and
you
could
not
practise
on
show
me
said
ratcliffe
a
single
example
of
such
a
divergence
and
i
will
accept
your
decision
without
another
lee
hesitated
and
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
as
though
to
be
quite
sure
that
he
was
in
earnest
there
was
an
effrontery
about
this
challenge
which
surprised
her
and
if
she
did
not
check
it
on
the
spot
there
was
no
saying
how
much
trouble
it
might
give
her
then
unlocking
the
drawer
of
the
at
her
elbow
she
took
out
letter
and
handed
it
to
ratcliffe
here
is
such
an
example
which
has
come
to
my
knowledge
very
lately
i
meant
to
show
it
to
you
in
any
case
but
i
would
rather
have
ratcliffe
took
the
letter
which
she
handed
to
him
opened
it
deliberately
looked
at
the
signature
and
read
he
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
or
disturbance
no
one
would
have
imagined
that
he
had
from
the
moment
he
saw
carrington
name
as
precise
a
knowledge
of
what
was
in
this
letter
as
though
he
had
written
it
himself
his
first
sensation
was
only
one
of
anger
that
his
projects
had
miscarried
how
this
had
happened
he
could
not
at
once
understand
for
the
idea
that
sybil
could
have
a
hand
in
it
did
not
occur
to
him
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
sybil
was
a
silly
frivolous
girl
who
counted
for
nothing
in
her
sister
actions
he
had
fallen
into
the
usual
masculine
blunder
of
mixing
up
smartness
of
intelligence
with
strength
of
character
sybil
without
being
a
metaphysician
willed
anything
which
she
willed
at
all
with
more
energy
than
her
sister
did
who
was
worn
out
with
the
effort
of
life
ratcliffe
missed
this
point
and
was
left
to
wonder
who
it
was
that
had
crossed
his
path
and
how
carrington
had
managed
to
be
present
and
absent
to
get
a
good
office
in
mexico
and
to
baulk
his
schemes
in
washington
at
the
same
time
he
had
not
given
carrington
credit
for
so
much
cleverness
he
was
violently
irritated
at
the
check
another
day
he
thought
would
have
made
him
safe
on
this
side
and
possibly
he
was
right
had
he
once
succeeded
in
getting
ever
so
slight
a
hold
on
lee
he
would
have
told
her
this
story
with
his
own
colouring
and
from
his
own
point
of
view
and
he
fully
believed
he
could
do
this
in
such
a
way
as
to
rouse
her
sympathy
now
that
her
mind
was
prejudiced
the
task
would
be
much
more
difficult
yet
he
did
not
despair
for
it
was
his
theory
that
lee
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
wanted
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
white
house
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
be
there
himself
and
that
her
apparent
coyness
was
mere
feminine
indecision
in
the
face
of
temptation
his
thoughts
now
turned
upon
the
best
means
of
giving
again
the
upper
hand
to
her
ambition
he
wanted
to
drive
carrington
a
second
time
from
the
field
thus
it
was
that
having
read
the
letter
once
in
order
to
learn
what
was
in
it
he
turned
back
and
slowly
read
it
again
in
order
to
gain
time
then
he
replaced
it
in
its
envelope
and
returned
it
to
lee
who
with
equal
calmness
as
though
her
interest
in
it
were
at
an
end
tossed
it
negligently
into
the
fire
where
it
was
reduced
to
ashes
under
ratcliffe
eyes
he
watched
it
burn
for
a
moment
and
then
turning
to
her
said
with
his
usual
composure
i
meant
to
have
told
you
of
that
affair
myself
i
am
sorry
that
carrington
has
thought
proper
to
forestall
me
no
doubt
he
has
his
own
motives
for
taking
my
character
in
then
it
is
true
said
lee
a
little
more
quickly
than
she
had
meant
to
speak
true
in
its
leading
facts
untrue
in
some
of
its
details
and
in
the
impression
it
creates
during
the
presidential
election
which
took
place
eight
years
ago
last
autumn
there
was
as
you
may
remember
a
violent
contest
and
a
very
close
vote
we
believed
though
i
was
not
so
prominent
in
the
party
then
as
now
that
the
result
of
that
election
would
be
almost
as
important
to
the
nation
as
the
result
of
the
war
itself
our
defeat
meant
that
the
government
must
pass
into
the
hands
of
rebels
men
whose
designs
were
more
than
doubtful
and
who
could
not
even
if
their
designs
had
been
good
restrain
the
violence
of
their
followers
in
consequence
we
strained
every
nerve
money
was
freely
spent
even
to
an
amount
much
in
excess
of
our
resources
how
it
was
employed
i
will
not
say
i
do
not
even
know
for
i
held
myself
aloof
from
these
details
which
fell
to
the
national
central
committee
of
which
i
was
not
a
member
the
great
point
was
that
a
very
large
sum
had
been
borrowed
on
pledged
securities
and
must
be
repaid
the
members
of
the
national
committee
and
certain
senators
held
discussions
on
the
subject
in
which
i
shared
the
end
was
that
towards
the
close
of
the
session
the
head
of
the
committee
accompanied
by
two
senators
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
i
must
abandon
my
opposition
to
the
steamship
subsidy
they
made
no
open
avowal
of
their
reasons
and
i
did
not
press
for
one
their
declaration
as
the
responsible
heads
of
the
organization
that
certain
action
on
my
part
was
essential
to
the
interests
of
the
party
satisfied
me
i
did
not
consider
myself
at
liberty
to
persist
in
a
mere
private
opinion
in
regard
to
a
measure
about
which
i
recognized
the
extreme
likelihood
of
my
being
in
error
i
accordingly
reported
the
bill
and
voted
for
it
as
did
a
large
majority
of
the
party
baker
is
mistaken
in
saying
that
the
money
was
paid
to
me
if
it
was
paid
at
all
of
which
i
have
no
knowledge
except
from
this
letter
it
was
paid
to
the
representative
of
the
national
committee
i
received
no
money
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
money
further
than
as
i
might
draw
my
own
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
subsequent
payment
of
the
campaign
lee
listened
to
all
this
with
intense
interest
not
until
this
moment
had
she
really
felt
as
though
she
had
got
to
the
heart
of
politics
so
that
she
could
like
a
physician
with
his
stethoscope
measure
the
organic
disease
now
at
last
she
knew
why
the
pulse
beat
with
such
unhealthy
irregularity
and
why
men
felt
an
anxiety
which
they
could
not
or
would
not
explain
her
interest
in
the
disease
overcame
her
disgust
at
the
foulness
of
the
revelation
to
say
that
the
discovery
gave
her
actual
pleasure
would
be
doing
her
injustice
but
the
excitement
of
the
moment
swept
away
every
other
sensation
she
did
not
even
think
of
herself
not
until
afterwards
did
she
fairly
grasp
the
absurdity
of
ratcliffe
wish
that
in
the
face
of
such
a
story
as
this
she
should
still
have
vanity
enough
to
undertake
the
reform
of
politics
and
with
his
aid
too
the
audacity
of
the
man
would
have
seemed
sublime
if
she
had
felt
sure
that
he
knew
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
between
a
lie
and
the
truth
but
the
more
she
saw
of
him
the
surer
she
was
that
his
courage
was
mere
moral
paralysis
and
that
he
talked
about
virtue
and
vice
as
a
man
who
is
talks
about
red
and
green
he
did
not
see
them
as
she
saw
them
if
left
to
choose
for
himself
he
would
have
nothing
to
guide
him
was
it
politics
that
had
caused
this
atrophy
of
the
moral
senses
by
disuse
meanwhile
here
she
sat
face
to
face
with
a
moral
lunatic
who
had
not
even
enough
sense
of
humour
to
see
the
absurdity
of
his
own
request
that
she
should
go
out
to
the
shore
of
this
ocean
of
corruption
and
repeat
the
ancient
rôle
of
king
canute
or
dame
partington
with
her
mop
and
her
pail
what
was
to
be
done
with
such
an
animal
the
bystander
who
looked
on
at
this
scene
with
a
wider
knowledge
of
facts
might
have
found
entertainment
in
another
view
of
the
subject
that
is
to
say
in
the
guilelessness
ot
madeleine
lee
with
all
her
warnings
she
was
yet
a
mere
in
the
face
of
the
great
politician
she
accepted
his
story
as
true
and
she
thought
it
as
bad
as
possible
but
had
ratcliffe
associates
now
been
present
to
hear
his
version
of
it
they
would
have
looked
at
each
other
with
a
smile
of
professional
pride
and
would
have
roundly
sworn
that
he
was
beyond
a
doubt
the
ablest
man
this
country
had
ever
produced
and
next
to
certain
of
being
president
they
would
not
however
have
told
their
own
side
of
the
story
if
they
could
have
helped
it
but
in
talking
it
over
among
themselves
they
might
have
assumed
the
facts
to
have
been
nearly
as
follows
that
ratcliffe
had
dragged
them
into
an
enormous
expenditure
to
carry
his
own
state
and
with
it
his
own
to
the
senate
that
they
had
tried
to
hold
him
responsible
and
he
had
tried
to
shirk
the
responsibility
that
there
had
been
warm
discussions
on
the
subject
that
he
himself
had
privately
suggested
recourse
to
baker
had
shaped
his
conduct
accordingly
and
had
compelled
them
in
order
to
save
their
own
credit
to
receive
the
money
even
if
lee
had
heard
this
part
of
the
story
though
it
might
have
sharpened
her
indignation
against
ratcliffe
it
would
not
have
altered
her
opinions
as
it
was
she
had
heard
enough
and
with
a
great
effort
to
control
her
expression
of
disgust
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
as
ratcliffe
concluded
finding
that
she
did
not
speak
he
went
on
i
do
not
undertake
to
defend
this
affair
it
is
the
act
of
my
public
life
which
i
most
regret
not
the
doing
but
the
necessity
of
doing
i
do
not
differ
from
you
in
opinion
on
that
point
i
can
not
acknowledge
that
there
is
here
any
real
divergence
between
i
am
afraid
said
lee
that
i
can
not
agree
with
this
brief
remark
the
very
brevity
of
which
carried
a
barb
of
sarcasm
escaped
from
madeleine
lips
before
she
had
fairly
intended
it
ratcliffe
felt
the
sting
and
it
started
him
from
his
studied
calmness
of
manner
rising
from
his
chair
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
before
lee
and
broke
out
upon
her
with
an
oration
in
that
old
senatorial
voice
and
style
which
was
least
calculated
to
enlist
her
sympathies
mrs
lee
said
he
with
harsh
emphasis
and
dogmatic
tone
there
are
conflicting
duties
in
all
the
transactions
of
life
except
the
simplest
however
we
may
act
do
what
we
may
we
must
violate
some
moral
obligation
all
that
can
be
asked
of
us
is
that
we
should
guide
ourselves
by
what
we
think
the
highest
at
the
time
this
affair
occurred
i
was
a
senator
of
the
united
states
i
was
also
a
trusted
member
of
a
great
political
party
which
i
looked
upon
as
identical
with
the
nation
in
both
capacities
i
owed
duties
to
my
constituents
to
the
government
to
the
people
i
might
interpret
these
duties
narrowly
or
broadly
i
might
say
perish
the
government
perish
the
union
perish
this
people
rather
than
that
i
should
soil
my
hands
or
i
might
say
as
i
did
and
as
i
would
say
again
be
my
fate
what
it
may
this
glorious
union
the
last
hope
of
suffering
humanity
shall
be
here
he
paused
and
seeing
that
lee
after
looking
for
a
time
at
him
was
now
regarding
the
fire
lost
in
meditation
over
the
strange
vagaries
of
the
senatorial
mind
he
resumed
in
another
line
of
argument
he
rightly
judged
that
there
must
be
some
moral
defect
in
his
last
remarks
although
he
could
not
see
it
which
made
persistence
in
that
direction
useless
you
ought
not
to
blame
me
you
can
not
blame
me
justly
it
is
to
your
sense
of
justice
i
appeal
have
i
ever
concealed
from
you
my
opinions
on
this
subject
have
i
not
on
the
contrary
always
avowed
them
did
i
not
here
on
this
very
spot
when
challenged
once
before
by
this
same
carrington
take
credit
for
an
act
less
defensible
than
this
did
i
not
tell
you
then
that
i
had
even
violated
the
sanctity
of
a
great
popular
election
and
reversed
its
result
that
was
my
sole
act
in
comparison
with
it
this
is
a
trifle
who
is
injured
by
a
steamship
company
subscribing
one
or
ten
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
a
campaign
fund
whose
rights
are
affected
by
it
perhaps
its
stock
holders
receive
one
dollar
a
share
in
dividends
less
than
they
otherwise
would
if
they
do
not
complain
who
else
can
do
so
but
in
that
election
i
deprived
a
million
people
of
rights
which
belonged
to
them
as
absolutely
as
their
houses
you
could
not
say
that
i
had
done
wrong
not
a
word
of
blame
or
criticism
have
you
ever
uttered
to
me
on
that
account
if
there
was
an
offence
you
condoned
it
you
certainly
led
me
to
suppose
that
you
saw
none
why
are
you
now
so
severe
upon
the
smaller
crime
this
shot
struck
hard
lee
visibly
shrank
under
it
and
lost
her
composure
this
was
the
same
reproach
she
had
made
against
herself
and
to
which
she
had
been
able
to
find
no
reply
with
some
agitation
she
exclaimed
mr
ratcliffe
pray
do
me
justice
i
have
tried
not
to
be
severe
i
have
said
nothing
in
the
way
of
attack
or
blame
i
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
my
place
to
stand
in
judgment
over
your
acts
i
have
more
reason
to
blame
myself
than
you
and
god
knows
i
have
blamed
myself
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
these
last
words
and
her
voice
trembled
ratcliffe
saw
that
he
had
gained
an
advantage
and
sitting
down
nearer
to
her
he
dropped
his
voice
and
urged
his
suit
still
more
energetically
you
did
me
justice
then
why
not
do
it
now
you
were
convinced
then
that
i
did
the
best
i
could
i
have
always
done
so
on
the
other
hand
i
have
never
pretended
that
all
my
acts
could
be
justified
by
abstract
morality
where
then
is
the
divergence
between
us
lee
did
not
undertake
to
answer
this
last
argument
she
only
returned
to
her
old
ground
mr
ratcliffe
she
said
i
do
not
want
to
argue
this
question
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
can
overcome
me
in
argument
perhaps
on
my
side
this
is
a
matter
of
feeling
rather
than
of
reason
but
the
truth
is
only
too
evident
to
me
that
i
am
not
fitted
for
politics
i
should
be
a
drag
upon
you
let
me
be
the
judge
of
my
own
weakness
do
not
insist
upon
pressing
me
further
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
this
appeal
to
a
man
whom
she
could
not
respect
as
though
she
were
a
suppliant
at
his
mercy
but
she
feared
the
reproach
of
having
deceived
him
and
she
tried
pitiably
to
escape
it
ratcliffe
was
only
encouraged
by
her
weakness
i
must
insist
upon
pressing
it
lee
replied
he
and
he
became
yet
more
earnest
as
he
went
on
my
future
is
too
deeply
involved
in
your
decision
to
allow
of
my
accepting
your
answer
as
final
i
need
your
aid
there
is
nothing
i
will
not
do
to
obtain
it
do
you
require
affection
mine
for
you
is
boundless
i
am
ready
to
prove
it
by
a
life
of
devotion
do
you
doubt
my
sincerity
test
it
in
whatever
way
you
please
do
you
fear
being
dragged
down
to
the
level
of
ordinary
politicians
so
far
as
concerns
myself
my
great
wish
is
to
have
your
help
in
purifying
politics
what
higher
ambition
can
there
be
than
to
serve
one
country
for
such
an
end
your
sense
of
duty
is
too
keen
not
to
feel
that
the
noblest
objects
which
can
inspire
any
woman
combine
to
point
out
your
lee
was
excessively
uncomfortable
although
not
in
the
least
shaken
she
began
to
see
that
she
must
take
a
stronger
tone
if
she
meant
to
bring
this
importunity
to
an
end
and
she
answered
i
do
not
doubt
your
affection
or
your
sincerity
ratcliffe
it
is
myself
i
doubt
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
give
me
much
of
your
confidence
this
winter
and
if
i
do
not
yet
know
about
politics
all
that
is
to
be
known
i
have
learned
enough
to
prove
that
i
could
do
nothing
sillier
than
to
suppose
myself
competent
to
reform
anything
if
i
pretended
to
think
so
i
should
be
a
mere
worldly
ambitious
woman
such
as
people
think
me
the
idea
of
my
purifying
politics
is
absurd
i
am
sorry
to
speak
so
strongly
but
i
mean
it
i
do
not
cling
very
closely
to
life
and
do
not
value
my
own
very
highly
but
i
will
not
tangle
it
in
such
a
way
i
will
not
share
the
profits
of
vice
i
am
not
willing
to
be
made
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
or
to
be
put
in
a
position
where
i
am
perpetually
obliged
to
maintain
that
immorality
is
a
virtue
as
she
went
on
she
became
more
and
more
animated
and
her
words
took
a
sharper
edge
than
she
had
intended
ratcliffe
felt
it
and
showed
his
annoyance
his
face
grew
dark
and
his
eyes
looked
out
at
her
with
their
ugliest
expression
he
even
opened
his
mouth
for
an
angry
retort
but
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
and
presently
resumed
his
argument
i
had
hoped
he
began
more
solemnly
than
ever
that
i
should
find
in
you
a
lofty
courage
which
would
disregard
such
risks
if
all
the
men
and
women
were
to
take
the
tone
you
have
taken
our
government
would
soon
perish
if
you
consent
to
share
my
career
i
do
not
deny
that
you
may
find
less
satisfaction
than
i
hope
but
you
will
lead
a
mere
death
in
life
if
you
place
yourself
like
a
saint
on
a
solitary
column
i
plead
what
i
believe
to
be
your
own
cause
in
pleading
mine
do
not
sacrifice
your
life
lee
was
in
despair
she
could
not
reply
what
was
on
her
lips
that
to
marry
a
murderer
or
a
thief
was
not
a
sure
way
of
diminishing
crime
she
had
already
said
something
so
much
like
this
that
she
shrank
from
speaking
more
plainly
so
she
fell
back
on
her
old
theme
we
must
at
all
events
ratcliffe
use
our
judgments
according
to
our
own
consciences
i
can
only
repeat
now
what
i
said
at
first
i
am
sorry
to
seem
insensible
to
your
expressions
towards
me
but
i
can
not
do
what
you
wish
let
us
maintain
our
old
relations
if
you
will
but
do
not
press
me
further
on
this
ratcliffe
grew
more
and
more
sombre
as
he
became
aware
that
defeat
was
staring
him
in
the
face
he
was
tenacious
of
purpose
and
he
had
never
in
his
life
abandoned
an
object
which
he
had
so
much
at
heart
as
this
he
would
not
abandon
it
for
the
moment
so
completely
had
the
fascination
of
lee
got
the
control
of
him
he
would
rather
have
abandoned
the
presidency
itself
than
her
he
really
loved
her
as
earnestly
as
it
was
in
his
nature
to
love
anything
to
her
obstinacy
he
would
oppose
an
obstinacy
greater
still
but
in
the
meanwhile
his
attack
was
disconcerted
and
he
was
at
a
loss
what
next
to
do
was
it
not
possible
to
change
his
ground
to
offer
inducements
that
would
appeal
even
more
strongly
to
feminine
ambition
and
love
of
display
than
the
presidency
itself
he
began
again
is
there
no
form
of
pledge
i
can
give
you
no
sacrifice
i
can
make
you
dislike
politics
shall
i
leave
political
life
i
will
do
anything
rather
than
lose
you
i
can
probably
control
the
appointment
of
minister
to
england
the
president
would
rather
have
me
there
than
here
suppose
i
were
to
abandon
politics
and
take
the
english
mission
would
that
sacrifice
not
affect
you
you
might
pass
four
years
in
london
where
there
would
be
no
politics
and
where
your
social
position
would
be
the
best
in
the
world
and
this
would
lead
to
the
presidency
almost
as
surely
as
the
then
suddenly
seeing
that
he
was
making
no
headway
he
threw
off
his
studied
calmness
and
broke
out
in
an
appeal
of
almost
equally
studied
violence
mrs
lee
madeleine
i
can
not
live
without
you
the
sound
of
your
voice
the
touch
of
your
hand
even
the
rustle
of
your
dress
are
like
wine
to
me
for
god
sake
do
not
throw
me
over
he
meant
to
crush
opposition
by
force
more
and
more
vehement
as
he
spoke
he
actually
bent
over
and
tried
to
seize
her
hand
she
drew
it
back
as
though
he
were
a
reptile
she
was
exasperated
by
this
obstinate
disregard
of
her
forbearance
this
gross
attempt
to
bribe
her
with
office
this
flagrant
abandonment
of
even
a
pretence
of
public
virtue
the
mere
thought
of
his
touch
on
her
person
was
more
repulsive
than
a
loathsome
disease
bent
upon
teaching
him
a
lesson
he
would
never
forget
she
spoke
out
abruptly
and
with
evident
signs
of
contempt
in
her
voice
and
manner
mr
ratcliffe
i
am
not
to
be
bought
no
rank
no
dignity
no
consideration
no
conceivable
expedient
would
induce
me
to
change
my
mind
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
ratcliffe
had
already
been
more
than
once
during
this
conversation
on
the
verge
of
losing
his
temper
naturally
dictatorial
and
violent
only
long
training
and
severe
experience
had
taught
him
and
when
he
gave
way
to
passion
his
bursts
of
fury
were
still
tremendous
lee
evident
personal
disgust
even
more
than
her
last
sharp
rebuke
passed
the
bounds
of
his
patience
as
he
stood
before
her
even
she
as
she
was
and
not
in
a
calm
frame
of
mind
felt
a
momentary
shock
at
seeing
how
his
face
flushed
his
eyes
gleamed
and
his
hands
trembled
with
rage
ah
exclaimed
he
turning
upon
her
with
a
harshness
almost
a
savageness
of
manner
that
startled
her
still
more
i
might
have
known
what
to
expect
clinton
warned
me
early
she
said
then
that
i
should
find
you
a
heartless
coquette
mr
ratcliffe
exclaimed
madeleine
rising
from
her
chair
and
speaking
in
a
warning
voice
almost
as
passionate
as
his
own
a
heartless
coquette
he
repeated
still
more
harshly
than
before
she
said
you
would
do
just
this
that
you
meant
to
deceive
me
that
you
lived
on
flattery
that
you
could
never
be
anything
but
a
coquette
and
that
if
you
married
me
i
should
repent
it
all
my
life
i
believe
her
now
lee
temper
too
was
naturally
a
high
one
at
this
moment
she
too
was
flaming
with
anger
and
wild
with
a
passionate
impulse
to
annihilate
this
man
conscious
that
the
mastery
was
in
her
own
hands
she
could
the
more
easily
control
her
voice
and
with
an
expression
of
unutterable
contempt
she
spoke
her
last
words
to
him
words
which
had
been
ringing
all
day
in
her
ears
mr
ratcliffe
i
have
listened
to
you
with
a
great
deal
more
patience
and
respect
than
you
deserve
for
one
long
hour
i
have
degraded
myself
by
discussing
with
you
the
question
whether
i
should
marry
a
man
who
by
his
own
confession
has
betrayed
the
highest
trusts
that
could
be
placed
in
him
who
has
taken
money
for
his
votes
as
a
senator
and
who
is
now
in
public
office
by
means
of
a
successful
fraud
of
his
own
when
in
justice
he
should
be
in
a
state
prison
i
will
have
no
more
of
this
understand
once
for
all
that
there
is
an
impassable
gulf
between
your
life
and
mine
i
do
not
doubt
that
you
will
make
yourself
president
but
whatever
or
wherever
you
are
never
speak
to
me
or
recognize
me
again
he
glared
a
moment
into
her
face
with
a
sort
of
blind
rage
and
seemed
about
to
say
more
when
she
swept
past
him
and
before
he
realized
it
he
was
alone
overmastered
by
passion
but
conscious
that
he
was
powerless
ratcliffe
after
a
moment
hesitation
left
the
room
and
the
house
he
let
himself
out
shutting
the
front
door
behind
him
and
as
he
stood
on
the
pavement
old
baron
jacobi
who
had
special
reasons
for
wishing
to
know
how
lee
had
recovered
from
the
fatigue
and
excitements
of
the
ball
came
up
to
the
spot
a
single
glance
at
ratcliffe
showed
him
that
something
had
gone
wrong
in
the
career
of
that
great
man
whose
fortunes
he
always
followed
with
so
bitter
a
sneer
of
contempt
impelled
by
the
spirit
of
evil
always
at
his
elbow
the
baron
seized
this
moment
to
sound
the
depth
of
his
wound
they
met
at
the
door
so
closely
that
recognition
was
inevitable
and
jacobi
with
his
worst
smile
held
out
his
hand
saying
at
the
same
moment
with
diabolic
malignity
i
hope
i
may
offer
my
felicitations
to
your
excellency
ratcliffe
was
glad
to
find
some
victim
on
whom
he
could
vent
his
rage
he
had
a
long
score
of
humiliations
to
repay
this
man
whose
last
insult
was
beyond
all
endurance
with
an
oath
he
dashed
jacobi
hand
aside
and
grasping
his
shoulder
thrust
him
out
of
the
path
the
baron
among
whose
weaknesses
the
want
of
high
temper
and
personal
courage
was
not
recorded
had
no
mind
to
tolerate
such
an
insult
from
such
a
man
even
while
ratcliffe
hand
was
still
on
his
shoulder
he
had
raised
his
cane
and
before
the
secretary
saw
what
was
coming
the
old
man
had
struck
him
with
all
his
force
full
in
the
face
for
a
moment
ratcliffe
staggered
back
and
grew
pale
but
the
shock
sobered
him
he
hesitated
a
single
instant
whether
to
crush
his
assailant
with
a
blow
but
he
felt
that
for
one
of
his
youth
and
strength
to
attack
an
infirm
diplomatist
in
a
public
street
would
be
a
fatal
blunder
and
while
jacobi
stood
violently
excited
with
his
cane
raised
ready
to
strike
another
blow
ratcliffe
suddenly
turned
his
back
and
without
a
word
hastened
away
when
sybil
returned
not
long
afterwards
she
found
no
one
in
the
parlour
on
going
to
her
sister
room
she
discovered
madeleine
lying
on
the
couch
looking
worn
and
pale
but
with
a
slight
smile
and
a
peaceful
expression
on
her
face
as
though
she
had
done
some
act
which
her
conscience
approved
she
called
sybil
to
her
side
and
taking
her
hand
said
sybil
dearest
will
you
go
abroad
with
me
again
of
course
i
will
said
sybil
i
will
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
with
i
want
to
go
to
egypt
said
madeleine
still
smiling
faintly
democracy
has
shaken
my
nerves
to
pieces
oh
what
rest
it
would
be
to
live
in
the
great
pyramid
and
look
out
for
ever
at
the
polar
star
conclusion
sybil
to
carrington
may
new
york
my
dear
carrington
i
promised
to
write
you
and
so
to
keep
my
promise
and
also
because
my
sister
wishes
me
to
tell
you
about
our
plans
i
send
this
letter
we
have
left
washington
for
ever
i
am
afraid
and
are
going
to
europe
next
month
you
must
know
that
a
fortnight
ago
lord
skye
gave
a
great
ball
to
the
of
quite
unspellable
i
never
can
describe
things
but
it
was
all
very
fine
i
wore
a
lovely
new
dress
and
was
a
great
success
i
assure
you
so
was
madeleine
though
she
had
to
sit
most
of
the
evening
by
the
princess
such
a
dowdy
the
duke
danced
with
me
several
times
he
ca
reverse
but
that
does
seem
to
matter
in
a
well
things
came
to
a
crisis
at
the
end
of
the
evening
i
followed
your
directions
and
after
we
got
home
gave
your
letter
to
madeleine
she
says
she
has
burned
it
i
do
know
what
happened
afterwards
a
tremendous
scene
i
suspect
but
victoria
dare
writes
me
from
washington
that
every
one
is
talking
about
refusal
of
and
a
dreadful
thing
that
took
place
on
our
very
doorstep
between
and
baron
jacobi
the
day
after
the
ball
she
says
there
was
a
regular
pitched
battle
and
the
baron
struck
him
over
the
face
with
his
cane
you
know
how
afraid
madeleine
was
that
they
would
do
something
of
the
sort
in
our
parlour
i
glad
they
waited
till
they
were
in
the
street
but
it
shocking
they
say
the
baron
is
to
be
sent
away
or
recalled
or
something
i
like
the
old
gentleman
and
for
his
sake
am
glad
duelling
is
gone
out
of
fashion
though
i
do
much
believe
silas
ratcliffe
could
hit
anything
the
baron
passed
through
here
three
days
ago
on
his
summer
trip
to
europe
he
left
his
card
on
us
but
we
were
out
and
did
not
see
him
we
are
going
over
in
july
with
the
schneidekoupons
and
schneidekoupon
has
promised
to
send
his
yacht
to
the
mediterranean
so
that
we
shall
sail
about
there
after
finishing
the
nile
and
see
jerusalem
and
gibraltar
and
constantinople
i
think
it
will
be
perfectly
lovely
i
hate
ruins
but
i
fancy
you
can
buy
delicious
things
in
constantinople
of
course
after
what
has
happened
we
can
never
go
back
to
washington
i
shall
miss
our
rides
dreadfully
i
read
browning
ride
together
as
you
told
me
i
think
beautiful
and
perfectly
easy
all
but
a
little
i
never
could
understand
a
word
of
him
before
so
i
never
tried
who
do
you
think
is
engaged
victoria
dare
to
a
coronet
and
a
with
lord
dunbeg
attached
victoria
says
she
is
happier
than
she
ever
was
before
in
any
of
her
other
engagements
and
she
is
sure
this
is
the
real
one
she
says
she
has
thirty
thousand
a
year
derived
from
the
poor
of
america
which
may
just
as
well
go
to
relieve
one
of
the
poor
in
ireland
you
know
her
father
was
a
claim
agent
or
some
such
thing
and
is
said
to
have
made
his
money
by
cheating
his
clients
out
of
their
claims
she
is
perfectly
wild
to
be
a
countess
and
means
to
make
castle
dunbeg
lovely
and
entertain
us
all
there
madeleine
says
she
is
just
the
kind
to
be
a
great
success
in
london
madeleine
is
very
well
and
sends
her
kind
regards
i
believe
she
is
going
to
add
a
postscript
i
have
promised
to
let
her
read
this
but
i
do
think
a
chaperoned
letter
is
much
fun
to
write
or
receive
hoping
to
hear
from
you
soon
sincerely
yours
sybil
enclosed
was
a
thin
strip
of
paper
containing
another
message
from
sybil
privately
inserted
at
the
last
moment
unknown
to
lee
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
try
again
after
she
comes
lee
was
very
short
the
bitterest
part
of
all
this
horrid
story
is
that
nine
out
of
ten
of
our
countrymen
would
say
i
had
made
a
mistake
