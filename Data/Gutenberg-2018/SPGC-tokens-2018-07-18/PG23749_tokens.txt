medusa
how
did
medusa
do
her
hair
the
question
fills
me
with
despair
it
must
have
caused
her
sore
distress
that
head
of
curling
snakes
to
dress
whenever
after
endless
toil
she
coaxed
it
finally
to
coil
the
music
of
a
passing
band
would
cause
each
separate
hair
to
stand
on
end
and
sway
and
writhe
and
spit
she
could
do
a
thing
with
it
and
being
woman
and
aware
of
such
disaster
to
her
hair
what
she
do
but
petrify
all
whom
she
met
with
freezing
eye
illustration
the
siren
the
siren
may
be
said
to
be
the
of
the
sea
tho
mermaids
claim
her
as
their
kin
instead
of
fishy
tail
and
fin
two
shapely
feet
rejoice
the
view
with
all
that
appertains
thereto
when
to
these
other
charms
we
add
a
voice
that
drives
the
hearer
mad
who
will
dispute
her
claim
to
be
the
of
the
sea
illustration
the
dolphin
the
dolphin
was
if
you
should
wish
to
call
him
so
the
king
of
fish
though
having
neither
gills
nor
scales
his
title
prince
of
whales
while
too
small
waisted
to
provide
a
jonah
with
a
berth
inside
the
dolphin
has
been
known
to
pack
a
drowning
sailor
on
his
back
and
bear
him
safely
into
port
he
was
a
in
short
illustration
the
cockatrice
if
you
will
listen
to
advice
you
will
avoid
the
cockatrice
a
caution
i
need
hardly
say
wholly
superfluous
yet
had
you
lived
when
they
were
rife
such
warning
might
have
saved
your
life
to
meet
the
cockatrice
eye
means
certain
death
and
that
is
why
when
i
its
features
here
portray
i
make
it
look
the
other
way
o
cockatrice
were
you
so
mean
what
must
the
have
been
illustration
cerberus
dear
reader
should
you
chance
to
go
to
hades
do
not
fail
to
throw
a
sop
to
cerberus
at
the
gate
his
anger
to
propitiate
do
say
good
dog
and
hope
thereby
his
three
fierce
heads
to
pacify
what
though
he
try
to
be
polite
and
wag
his
tail
with
all
his
might
how
shall
one
amiable
tail
against
three
angry
heads
prevail
the
heads
what
puzzles
me
is
why
in
hades
there
should
be
a
watch
dog
is
i
should
surmise
the
place
one
would
burglarize
illustration
the
sphinx
she
was
half
lady
and
half
cat
what
is
so
wonderful
in
that
half
of
our
lady
friends
so
say
the
other
half
are
in
egypt
she
made
quite
a
stir
they
carved
huge
images
of
her
riddles
she
asked
of
all
she
met
and
all
who
answered
wrong
she
ate
when
oedipus
her
riddle
solved
the
minx
i
mean
the
sphinx
dissolved
in
tears
what
is
there
when
one
thinks
so
wonderful
about
the
sphinx
illustration
the
sea
serpent
o
wondrous
worm
that
won
the
height
of
fame
by
keeping
out
of
sight
never
was
known
on
land
or
sea
such
a
colossal
modesty
never
such
arrogant
pretence
of
ostentatious
diffidence
celebrity
whom
none
has
seen
save
some
post
prandial
marine
no
magazine
can
reproduce
your
oh
what
the
use
of
doing
things
when
one
may
be
so
famous
a
nonentity
illustration
the
salamander
the
salamander
made
his
bed
among
the
glowing
embers
red
a
fiery
furnace
to
his
mind
hygiene
and
luxury
combined
he
was
if
i
may
put
it
so
a
saurian
abednigo
he
loved
to
climb
with
nimble
ease
the
branches
of
the
trees
where
oft
on
chilly
winter
nights
he
rose
to
dizzy
fahrenheits
believers
in
soul
transmigration
see
in
him
the
of
those
sad
plagues
of
summer
who
ask
is
it
hot
enough
for
you
illustration
the
jinn
to
call
a
jinn
the
only
thing
one
needed
was
a
magic
ring
you
rubbed
the
ring
and
forth
there
came
a
monster
born
of
smoke
and
flame
a
thing
of
vapor
fume
and
glare
ready
to
waft
you
anywhere
the
magic
jinns
of
yesterday
the
wand
of
science
now
obey
you
ring
and
lo
with
rush
and
roar
the
panting
monster
at
the
door
a
thing
of
vapor
fume
and
glare
ready
to
take
you
anywhere

a

what

between
the
giants
jinn
and

illustration
the
mermaid
although
a
fishwife
in
a
sense
she
does
not
barter
fish
for
pence
fisher
of
men
her
golden
nets
for
foolish
sailormen
she
sets
all
day
she
combs
her
hair
and
longs
for
dimpled
feet
and
all
night
she
dreams
in
ocean
caves
of
low
tide
shoes
and
marcel
waves
and
while
the
fishwife
making
sales
may
sell
her
wares
upon
her

the

wonderful
to

must

the
unicorn
the
unicorn
a
sort
he
helps
the
lion
to
support
the
royal
arms
of
england
king
and
keep
the
throne
from
tottering
i
wonder
what
the
king
would
do
if
his
supporters
all
withdrew
perhaps
he
try
the
stage
a
throne
should
be
an
easy
to
histrionic
heights
and
who
knows
till
he
tries
what
he
can
do
the
king
with
diligence
and
care
rise
to
be
a
manager
illustration
the
satyr
the
satyr
lived
in
times
remote
a
shape
and
who
having
all
man
faults
combined
with
a
goat
nature
unrefined
was
not
what
you
would
call
a
bright
example
or
a
shining
light
far
be
it
from
me
to
condone
the
satyr
sins
yet
i
must
own
i
like
to
think
there
were
a
few
young
satyrs
who
to
heaven
flew
and
when
saint
peter
thunder
browed
seeing
them
cried
no
goats
allowed
although
the
gate
slammed
quickly
to
somehow
their
human
halves
got
through
whereat
the
kindly
saint
relented
and
that
how
cherubs
were
invented
illustration
the
gargoyle
the
gargoyle
often
makes
its
perch
on
a
cathedral
or
a
church
where
mid
ecclesiastic
style
it
smiles
an
smile
and
while
the
parson
dignified
spouts
at
his
weary
flock
inside
the
gargoyle
from
its
lofty
seat
spouts
at
the
people
in
the
street
and
like
the
parson
seems
to
say
to
those
beneath
him
let
us
spray
i
like
the
gargoyle
best
it
plays
so
cheerfully
on
rainy
days
while
parsons
no
one
can
deny
are
awful
dampers
when
they
dry
illustration
the
chimera
you
think
a
lion
or
a
snake
were
quite
enough
one
nerves
to
shake
but
in
this
classic
beast
we
find
a
lion
and
a
snake
combined
and
just
as
if
that
were
enough
a
goat
thrown
in
to
make
it
tough
let
scientists
the
breed
pooh
pooh
come
with
me
to
some
social
zoo
and
hear
the
bearded
lion
bleat
on
feet
whose
civil
leer
and
damning
praise
the
serpent
cloven
tongue
betrays
lo
lion
goat
and
snake
combined
thus
nature
doth
repeat
her
kind

the

nix
was
as
you
might
say
the
burning
question
of
his
day
the
more
he
burned
the
more
he
grew
splendiferous
in
feathers
new
and
from
his
ashes
rising
bland
did
business
at
the
same
old
stand
but
though
good
people
went
about
and
talked
they
could
not
put
him
out
a
bird
indeed
they
say
he
is
not
quite
extinct
illustration
the
gryphon
it
chanced
that
allah
looking
round
when
he
had
made
his
creatures
found
half
of
an
eagle
and
a
pair
of
extra
lion
legs
to
spare
so
hating
waste
he
took
some
glue
and
made
a
gryphon
of
the
two
but
when
his
handiwork
he
eyed
he
frowned
and
it
was
petrified
doomed
for
all
time
to
represent
impatience
on
a
monument

upon
our
path

the

led
a
double

two
natures
in
perpetual
strife

that
never

for
when

on

backed

i
saw
