the
has
restored
the
romance
of
travel
freeing
us
from
all
the
compulsions
and
contacts
of
the
railway
the
bondage
to
fixed
hours
and
the
beaten
track
the
approach
to
each
town
through
the
area
of
ugliness
and
desolation
created
by
the
railway
itself
it
has
given
us
back
the
wonder
the
adventure
and
the
novelty
which
enlivened
the
way
of
our
posting
above
all
these
recovered
pleasures
must
be
ranked
the
delight
of
taking
a
town
unawares
stealing
on
it
by
back
ways
and
unchronicled
paths
and
surprising
in
it
some
intimate
aspect
of
past
time
some
silhouette
hidden
for
half
a
century
or
more
by
the
ugly
mask
of
railway
embankments
and
the
iron
bulk
of
a
huge
station
then
the
villages
that
we
missed
and
yearned
for
from
the
windows
of
the
train
the
unseen
villages
have
been
given
back
to
us
and
nowhere
could
the
importance
of
the
recovery
have
been
more
delightfully
exemplified
than
on
a
may
afternoon
in
the
as
we
climbed
the
long
ascent
beyond
boulogne
on
the
road
to
arras
it
is
a
delightful
country
broken
into
wide
waves
of
hill
and
valley
with
high
and
leafy
enough
to
bear
comparison
with
the
kentish
hedges
among
which
our
motor
had
left
us
a
day
or
two
before
and
the
villages
the
frequent
smiling
villages
will
also
meet
successfully
the
more
serious
challenge
of
their
english
rivals
meet
it
on
other
grounds
and
in
other
ways
with
paved
and
clipped
instead
of
commons
with
soaring
belfries
instead
of
square
church
towers
with
less
of
verdure
but
more
perhaps
of
outline
certainly
of

the
country
itself
so
green
so
full
and
close
in
texture
so
pleasantly
diversified
by
clumps
of
woodland
in
the
hollows
and
by
streams
threading
the
great
fields
with
light
all
this
too
has
the
english
or
perhaps
the
flemish
quality
for
the
border
is
close
by
with
the
added
beauty
of
reach
and
amplitude
the
deliberate
gradual
flow
of
level
spaces
into
distant
slopes
till
the
land
breaks
in
a
long
blue
crest
against
the
seaward
horizon
there
was
much
beauty
of
detail
also
in
the
smaller
towns
through
which
we
passed
some
of
them
on
ridges
that
raked
the
open
country
with
old
houses
stumbling
down
at
picturesque
angles
from
the
central
others
tucked
in
the
hollows
among
orchards
and
barns
with
the
pleasant
country
industries
reaching
almost
to
the
doors
of
their
churches
in
the
little
villages
a
deep
delicious
thatch
overhangs
the
plastered
walls
of
cottages
espaliered
with
and
ducks
splash
in
ponds
fringed
with
hawthorn
and
laburnum
and
in
the
towns
there
is
almost
always
some
note
of
character
of
distinction
the
gateway
of
a
seventeenth
century
the
triple
arch
of
a
the
spring
of
an
old
mossy
apse
the
stucco
and
black
of
an
ancient
and
always
the
straight
or
trained
with
its
sharp
green
angles
and
sharp
black
shade
acquiring
a
value
positively
architectural
against
the
high
lights
of
the
paved
or
gravelled
everything
about
this
rich
juicy
land
bathed
in
blond
light
is
characteristically
flemish
even
to
the
eyes
of
the
peasants
the
bursting
red
cheeks
of
the
children
the
drowsy
grouping
of
the
cattle
in
flat
pastures
and
at
hesdin
we
felt
the
architectural
nearness
of
the
low
countries
in
the
presence
of
a
fine
of
the
late
renaissance
with
the
peculiar
movement
of
volutes
and
sculptured
ornament
against
warm
brick
that
one
associates
with
the
civic
architecture
of
belgium
a
fuller
less
sensitive
line
than
the
french
architect
permits
himself
with
more
massiveness
and
exuberance
of
detail
this
part
of
france
with
its
wide
expanse
of
agricultural
landscape
disciplined
and
cultivated
to
the
last
point
of
finish
shows
how
nature
may
be
utilized
to
the
utmost
clod
without
losing
its
freshness
and
naturalness
in
some
regions
of
this
supremely
administered
country
where
space
is
more
restricted
or
the
fortunate
accidents
of
water
and
varying
levels
are
lacking
the
minute
excessive
culture
the
endless
ranges
of
wall
and
the
long
lines
of
bordering
straight
interminable
roads
may
produce
in
the
american
traveller
a
reaction
toward
the
unkempt
a
momentary
feeling
that
ragged
and
weedy
fields
have
their
artistic
value
but
here
in
northern
france
where
agriculture
has
mated
with
poetry
instead
of
banishing
it
one
understands
the
higher
beauty
of
land
developed
humanised
brought
into
relation
to
life
and
history
as
compared
with
the
raw
material
with
which
the
greater
part
of
our
own
hemisphere
is
still
clothed
in
france
everything
speaks
of
long
familiar
intercourse
between
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
every
field
has
a
name
a
history
a
distinct
place
of
its
own
in
the
village
polity
every
blade
of
grass
is
there
by
an
old
feudal
right
which
has
long
since
dispossessed
the
worthless
aboriginal
weed
as
we
neared
arras
the
road
lost
its
pleasant
windings
and
ran
straight
across
a
great
plateau
with
an
occasional
long
dip
and
ascent
that
never
deflected
it
from
its
purpose
and
the
villages
became
rarer
as
they
always
do
on
the
high
plains
of
france
arras
however
was
full
of
compensations
for
the
dullness
of
the
approach
a
charming
old
grey
town
with
a
great
air
of
faded
opulence
in
which
one
would
have
liked
to
linger
picking
out
details
of
gateway
and
courtyard
of
sculptured
masks
and
balconies
if
only
a
brief
peep
into
the
hotel
had
not
so
promptly
quenched
the
impulse
to
spend
a
night
there
to
amiens
therefore
we
passed
on
passing
again
toward
sunset
into
a
more
broken
country
with
lights
just
beginning
to
gleam
through
the
windows
of
the
charming
villages
and
tall
black
crucifixes
rising
ghostly
at
the
and
night
was
obliterating
the
mighty
silhouette
of
the
cathedral
as
we
came
upon
it
at
length
by
a
long
descent
illustration
amiens
west
front
of
the
cathedral
it
is
always
a
loss
to
arrive
in
a
strange
town
after
dark
and
miss
those
preliminary
stages
of
acquaintance
that
are
so
much
more
likely
to
be
interesting
in
towns
than
in
people
but
the
deprivation
is
partly
atoned
for
by
the
sense
of
adventure
with
which
next
morning
one
casts
one
s
self
upon
the
unknown
there
is
no
conjectural
first
impression
to
be
modified
perhaps
got
rid
of
one
s
mind
presents
a
blank
page
for
the
town
to
write
its
name
on
at
amiens
the
autograph
consists
of
one
big
word
the
cathedral
other
fainter
writing
may
come
out
when
one
has
leisure
to
seek
for
it
but
the
predominance
of
those
mighty
characters
leaves
at
first
no
time
to
read
between
the
lines
and
here
it
may
be
noted
that
out
of
italy
it
takes
a
town
of
exceptional
strength
of
character
to
hold
its
own
against
a
cathedral
in
england
the
and
the
varied
groupings
of
buildings
constituting
the
close
which
seem
to
form
a
connecting
link
between
town
and
cathedral
do
no
more
in
reality
than
enlarge
the
skirts
of
the
monument
about
which
they
are
clustered
and
even
at
winchester
which
has
its
college
and
hospital
to
oppose
to
the
predominance
of
the
central
pile
there
is
after
all
very
little
dispersal
of
interest
so
prodigious
so
unparalleled
as
mere
feats
of
human
are
these
vast
achievements
of
the
middle
ages
in
northern
france
where
the
great
cathedrals
were
of
lay
foundation
and
consequently
sprang
up
alone
without
the
subordinate
colony
of
monastic
buildings
of
which
the
close
is
a
survival
and
where
as
far
as
monuments
of
any
importance
are
concerned
the
architectural
gap
sometimes
extends
from
louis
the
saint
to
louis
the
fourteenth
the
ascendancy
of
the
diocesan
church
is
necessarily
even
more
marked
rouen
alone
perhaps
opposes
an
effectual
defence
to
this
concentration
of
interest
will
not
for
a
moment
let
itself
be
elbowed
out
of
the
way
by
the
great
buttresses
of
its
cathedral
and
at
bourges
but
bourges
and
rouen
come
later
in
this
itinerary
and
meanwhile
here
we
are
standing
in
a
sharp
shower
under
a
doorway
and
looking
across
the
little
square
at
the
west
front
of
amiens
well
no
wonder
such
a
monument
has
silenced
all
competitors
it
would
take
a
mighty
to
make
itself
heard
against
the
surge
and
thunder
of
that
cloud
of
witnesses
choiring
forth
the
glories
of
the
church
triumphant
is
the
stage
too
crowded
is
there
a
certain
sameness
in
the
overarching
tiers
of
the
stone
hierarchy
each
figure
set
in
precise
alignment
with
its
neighbours
each
drapery
drawn
within
the
same
perpendicular
bounds
yes
perhaps
if
one
remembers
rheims
and
bourges
but
if
setting
aside
such
kindred
associations
one
surrenders
one
s
self
uncritically
to
the
total
impression
produced
if
one
lets
the
fortunate
accidents
of
time
and
weather
count
for
their
full
value
in
that
total
for
amiens
remains
mercifully
unscrubbed
and
its
armies
of
saints
have
taken
on
the
richest
that
northern
stone
can
acquire
if
one
views
the
thing
in
short
partly
as
a
symbol
and
partly
as
a
work
of
nature
which
all
ancient
monuments
by
grace
of
time
become
then
the
front
of
amiens
is
surely
one
of
the
most
splendid
spectacles
that
gothic
art
can
show
on
the
symbolic
side
especially
it
would
be
tempting
to
linger
so
strongly
does
the
contemplation
of
the
great
cathedrals
fortify
the
conviction
that
their
chief
value
to
this
later
age
is
not
so
much
æsthetic
as
moral
the
world
will
doubtless
always
divide
itself
into
two
orders
of
mind
that
which
sees
in
past
expressions
of
faith
political
religious
or
intellectual
only
the
bonds
cast
off
by
the
spirit
of
man
in
its
long
invincible
struggle
for
more
light
and
that
which
while
moved
by
the
spectacle
of
the
struggle
cherishes
also
every
sign
of
those
past
limitations
that
were
after
all
each
in
its
turn
symbols
of
the
same
effort
toward
a
clearer
vision
to
the
former
kind
of
mind
the
great
gothic
cathedral
will
be
chiefly
interesting
as
a
work
of
art
and
a
page
of
history
and
it
is
perhaps
proof
of
the
advantage
of
cultivating
the
other
the
more
complex
point
of
view
in
which
enfranchisement
of
thought
exists
in
harmony
with
atavism
of
feeling
that
it
permits
one
to
appreciate
these
archæological
values
to
the
full
yet
subordinates
them
to
the
more
impressive
facts
of
which
they
are
the
immense
and
moving
expression
to
such
minds
the
rousing
of
the
sense
of
reverence
is
the
supreme
gift
of
these
mighty
records
of
mediæval
life
reverence
for
the
persistent
forces
that
brought
them
forth
a
great
gothic
cathedral
sums
up
so
much
of
history
it
has
cost
so
much
in
faith
and
toil
in
blood
and
folly
and
saintly
abnegation
it
has
sheltered
such
a
long
succession
of
lives
given
collective
voice
to
so
many
inarticulate
and
contradictory
cravings
seen
so
much
that
was
sublime
and
terrible
or
foolish
pitiful
and
grotesque
that
it
is
like
some
mysteriously
preserved
ancestor
of
the
human
race
some
wandering
jew
grown
sedentary
and
throned
in
stony
contemplation
before
whom
the
fleeting
generations
come
and
go
illustration
amiens
ambulatory
of
the
cathedral
yes
reverence
is
the
most
precious
emotion
that
such
a
building
inspires
reverence
for
the
accumulated
experiences
of
the
past
readiness
to
puzzle
out
their
meaning
unwillingness
to
disturb
rashly
results
so
powerfully
willed
so
laboriously
arrived
at
the
desire
in
short
to
keep
intact
as
many
links
as
possible
between
yesterday
and
to
lose
in
the
ardour
of
new
experiment
the
least
that
may
be
of
the
long
rich
heritage
of
human
experience
this
at
any
rate
might
seem
to
be
the
cathedral
s
word
to
the
traveller
from
a
land
which
has
undertaken
to
get
on
without
the
past
or
to
regard
it
only
as
a
feature
of
æsthetic
interest
a
sight
to
which
one
travels
rather
than
a
light
by
which
one
lives
the
west
front
of
amiens
says
this
word
with
a
quite
peculiar
emphasis
its
grand
unity
of
structure
and
composition
witnessing
as
much
to
constancy
of
purpose
as
to
persistence
of
effort
so
steadily
so
clearly
was
this
great
thing
willed
and
foreseen
that
it
holds
the
mind
too
deeply
subject
to
its
general
conception
to
be
immediately
free
for
the
delighted
investigation
of
detail
but
within
the
building
detail
reasserts
itself
detail
within
detail
worked
out
and
multiplied
with
a
prodigality
of
enrichment
for
which
a
counterpart
must
be
sought
beyond
the
alps
the
interiors
of
the
great
french
cathedrals
are
as
a
rule
somewhat
gaunt
and
unfurnished
baring
their
structural
nakedness
sublimely
but
rather
monotonously
to
eyes
accustomed
to
the
italian
churches
all
glorious
here
at
amiens
however
the
inner
decking
of
the
shrine
has
been
piously
continued
from
generation
to
generation
and
a
quite
extraordinary
wealth
of
adornment
bestowed
on
the
choir
and
its
ambulatory
the
great
sculptured
and
painted
frieze
encircling
the
outer
side
of
the
choir
is
especially
surprising
in
a
french
church
so
seldom
were
the
stone
histories
lavished
on
the
exterior
continued
within
the
building
and
it
is
a
farther
surprise
to
find
the
same
tales
in
animating
and
enriching
the
west
walls
of
the
transepts
they
are
full
of
crowded
expressive
incidents
these
stories
of
local
saints
and
scriptural
personages
with
a
burgundian
richness
and
elaborateness
of
costume
and
a
quite
charming
childish
insistence
on
irrelevant
episode
and
detail
the
reiterated
and
so
and
then
of
the
calling
off
one
s
attention
into
innumerable
little
down
which
the
fancy
of
worshippers
must
have
strayed
with
oh
what
blessedness
of
relief
from
the
unintelligible
rites
before
the
altar
of
composition
there
is
none
it
is
necessarily
sacrificed
to
the
desire
to
stop
and
tell
everything
to
show
for
instance
in
an
interesting
parenthesis
exactly
what
herod
s
white
woolly
dog
was
about
while
salome
was
dancing
away
the
baptist
s
head
and
thus
one
is
brought
back
to
the
perpetually
recurring
fact
that
all
northern
art
is
anecdotic
and
has
always
been
so
and
that
for
instance
all
the
elaborate
theories
of
dramatic
construction
worked
out
to
explain
why
shakespeare
crowded
his
stage
with
subordinate
figures
and
unnecessary
incidents
and
would
certainly
in
relating
the
story
of
saint
john
have
included
herod
s
tray
and
sweetheart
among
the
dramatis
personæ
that
such
theories
are
but
an
unprofitable
evasion
of
the
ancient
ethnological
fact
the
goth
has
always
told
his
story
in
that
illustration
beauvais
west
front
of
the
cathedral
ii
beauvais
and
rouen
the
same
wonderful
white
road
flinging
itself
in
great
coils
and
across
the
same
spacious
landscape
swept
us
on
the
next
day
to
beauvais
if
there
seemed
to
be
fewer
memorable
incidents
by
the
way
if
the
villages
had
less
individual
character
over
and
above
their
general
charm
of
northern
thrift
and
cosiness
it
was
perhaps
because
the
first
impression
had
lost
its
edge
but
we
caught
fine
distant
reaches
of
field
and
orchard
and
wooded
hillside
giving
a
general
sense
that
it
would
be
a
good
land
to
live
in
till
all
these
minor
sensations
were
swallowed
up
and
lost
in
the
overwhelming
impression
of
beauvais
the
town
itself
almost
purposely
as
we
felt
afterward
failed
to
put
itself
forward
to
arrest
us
by
any
of
the
minor
arts
which
arras
for
instance
had
so
seductively
exerted
it
maintained
an
attitude
of
calm
aloofness
of
affected
ignorance
of
the
traveller
s
object
in
visiting
it
suffering
its
little
shuttered
streets
to
lead
us
up
tortuously
to
the
drowsiest
little
provincial
with
the
usual
and
the
usual
low
houses
across
the
way
where
suddenly
there
soared
before
us
the
great
mad
broken
dream
of
beauvais
choir
the
cathedral
without
a
nave
the
kubla
khan
of
architecture
it
seems
in
truth
like
some
climax
of
mystic
vision
miraculously
caught
in
visible
form
and
arrested
broken
off
by
the
intrusion
of
the
person
from
porlock
in
this
case
no
doubt
the
mason
crying
out
to
the
entranced
creator
we
simply
can
t
keep
it
up
and
because
it
literally
couldn
t
be
kept
up
as
one
or
two
alarming
collapses
soon
attested
it
had
to
check
there
its
great
wave
of
stone
hold
itself
for
ever
back
from
breaking
into
the
long
ridge
of
the
nave
and
flying
crests
of
buttress
spire
and
finial
it
is
easy
for
the
critic
to
point
out
its
structural
defects
and
to
cite
them
in
illustration
of
the
fact
that
your
true
artist
never
seeks
to
wrest
from
their
proper
uses
the
materials
in
which
he
works
does
not
for
instance
try
to
render
metaphysical
abstractions
in
stone
and
glass
and
lead
yet
beauvais
has
at
least
none
of
the
ungainliness
of
failure
it
is
like
a
great
hymn
interrupted
not
one
in
which
the
voices
have
flagged
and
to
the
desultory
mind
such
attempts
seem
to
deserve
a
place
among
the
fragmentary
glories
of
great
art
it
is
at
any
rate
an
example
of
what
the
gothic
spirit
pushed
to
its
logical
conclusion
strove
for
the
utterance
of
the
unutterable
and
he
who
condemns
beauvais
has
tacitly
condemned
the
whole
theory
of
art
from
which
it
issued
but
shall
we
not
have
gained
greatly
in
our
enjoyment
of
beauty
as
well
as
in
serenity
of
spirit
if
instead
of
saying
this
is
good
art
or
this
is
bad
art
we
say
this
is
classic
and
that
is
gothic
this
transcendental
that
rational
using
neither
term
as
an
epithet
of
opprobrium
or
restriction
but
content
when
we
have
performed
the
act
of
discrimination
to
note
what
forms
of
expression
each
tendency
has
worked
out
for
itself
beyond
beauvais
the
landscape
became
more
deeply
norman
more
thatched
and
green
and
though
as
far
as
the
noting
of
detail
went
we
did
not
really
get
at
all
but
travelled
on
imprisoned
in
that
tremendous
memory
till
abruptly
from
the
crest
of
a
hill
we
looked
down
a
long
green
valley
to
rouen
shining
on
its
river
belfries
spires
and
great
arched
bridges
drenched
with
a
golden
sunset
that
seemed
to
shoot
skyward
from
the
long
illuminated
reaches
of
the
seine
i
recall
only
two
such
magic
descents
on
famous
towns
that
on
orvieto
from
the
last
hill
of
the
viterbo
road
and
the
in
a
minor
key
but
full
of
a
small
ancient
majesty
the
view
of
wells
in
its
calm
valley
as
the
bath
road
gains
the
summit
of
the
mendip
hills
illustration
rouen
rue
de
l
horloge
the
poetry
of
the
descent
to
rouen
is
unhappily
dispelled
by
the
long
approach
through
sordid
interminable
outskirts
orvieto
and
wells
being
less
prosperous
do
not
subject
the
traveller
to
this
descent
into
prose
which
leaves
one
reflecting
mournfully
on
the
incompatibility
under
our
present
social
system
between
prosperity
and
beauty
as
for
rouen
itself
as
one
passes
down
its
crowded
quays
between
the
noisy
unloading
of
ships
and
the
clatter
of
innumerable
cafés
one
feels
that
the
old
gothic
town
one
used
to
know
can
not
really
exist
any
more
must
have
been
elbowed
out
of
place
by
these
spreading
commercial
activities
but
it
turns
out
to
be
there
after
all
holding
almost
intact
behind
the
dull
mask
of
modern
streets
the
surprise
of
its
rich
mediævalism
here
indeed
the
traveller
finds
himself
in
no
mere
cathedral
town
with
one
street
leading
to
saint
ouen
another
to
saint
maclou
a
third
to
the
beautiful
palais
de
justice
the
cathedral
itself
has
put
forth
the
appeal
of
all
its
accumulated
treasures
to
make
one
take
first
of
all
the
turn
to
its
doors
there
are
few
completer
impressions
in
europe
than
that
to
be
received
as
one
enters
the
lady
chapel
of
rouen
where
an
almost
italian
profusion
of
colour
and
ornament
have
been
suffered
to
accumulate
slowly
about
its
central
ornament
the
typically
northern
monument
of
the
two
cardinals
of
amboise
there
could
hardly
be
a
better
example
of
the
æsthetic
wisdom
of
living
and
letting
live
than
is
manifested
by
the
happy
way
in
which
supposedly
incompatible
artistic
ideals
have
contrived
to
make
in
this
delicious
corner
it
is
a
miracle
that
they
have
been
allowed
to
pursue
their
happy
experiment
till
now
for
there
must
have
been
moments
when
to
the
purist
of
the
renaissance
the
gothic
tomb
of
the
cardinals
seemed
unworthy
to
keep
company
with
the
sénéchal
de
brézé
s
monument
in
which
the
delicate
note
of
classicalism
reveals
a
france
so
profoundly
modified
by
italy
just
as
later
the
great
berniniesque
with
its
twisted
columns
and
exuberance
of
golden
rays
must
have
narrowly
escaped
the
axe
of
the
gothic
reactionary
but
there
they
all
are
blending
their
supposed
discords
in
a
more
complex
harmony
filling
the
privileged
little
edifice
with
an
overlapping
richness
of
hue
and
line
through
which
the
eye
perpetually
passes
back
to
the
central
splendour
of
the
cardinals
tomb
a
magnificent
monument
it
is
opposing
to
the
sober
beauty
of
germain
pilon
s
composition
its
insolence
of
varied
detail
the
this
and
this
and
this
of
the
loquacious
mediæval
craftsman
all
bound
together
by
the
pew
constructive
sense
which
has
already
learned
how
to
bring
the
topmost
bud
of
the
marble
finials
into
definite
relation
with
the
little
hooded
mourners
bowed
in
such
diversity
of
grief
in
their
niches
below
the
tomb
a
magnificent
monument
and
to
my
mind
the
finest
thing
about
it
is
the
cardinal
uncle
s
nose
the
whole
man
is
fine
in
his
sober
dignity
humbly
conscious
of
the
altar
toward
which
he
faces
arrogantly
aware
of
the
purple
on
his
shoulders
and
the
nose
is
the
epitome
of
the
man
we
live
in
the
day
of
little
noses
that
once
stately
feature
intrinsically
feudal
and
aristocratic
in
character
the
extolled
of
dante
has
shrunk
to
democratic
insignificance
like
many
another
fine
expression
of
individualism
and
so
one
must
look
to
the
old
painters
and
sculptors
to
see
what
a
nose
was
meant
to
be
the
prow
of
the
face
the
evidence
of
its
owner
s
standing
of
his
relation
to
the
world
and
his
inheritance
from
the
past
even
in
the
profile
of
the
cardinal
nephew
kneeling
a
little
way
behind
his
uncle
the
gallant
feature
is
seen
to
have
suffered
a
slight
diminution
its
spring
still
bold
is
less
commanding
it
seems
as
it
were
to
have
thrust
itself
against
a
less
yielding
element
and
so
the
deterioration
has
gone
on
from
generation
to
generation
till
the
nose
has
worn
itself
blunt
against
the
increasing
resistances
of
a
democratic
atmosphere
and
stunted
atrophied
and
amorphous
serves
only
now
to
let
us
know
when
we
have
the
influenza
with
the
revisiting
of
the
cardinal
s
nose
the
first
object
of
our
visit
to
rouen
had
been
accomplished
the
second
led
us
past
objects
of
far
greater
importance
to
the
but
dull
gallery
where
gerhard
david
s
virgin
of
the
grapes
is
to
be
seen
every
wanderer
through
the
world
has
these
pious
pilgrimages
to
perform
generally
to
shrines
of
no
great
note
how
often
for
instance
is
one
irresistibly
drawn
back
to
the
transfiguration
or
to
the
venus
of
milo
but
to
lesser
works
first
seen
perhaps
at
a
fortunate
moment
or
having
some
special
quality
of
suggestion
and
evocation
that
the
perfect
equilibrium
of
the
masterpieces
causes
them
to
lack
so
i
know
of
some
who
go
first
to
the
death
of
procris
in
the
national
gallery
to
the
little
apollo
and
marsyas
of
the
salon
carré
to
a
fantastic
allegorical
picture
subject
and
artist
unknown
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
uffizi
and
who
would
travel
more
miles
to
see
again
in
the
little
gallery
of
rimini
an
entombment
of
the
school
of
mantegna
than
to
sit
beneath
the
vault
of
the
sistine
illustration
rouen
the
façade
of
the
church
of
all
of
which
may
seem
to
imply
an
unintentional
disparagement
of
gerhard
david
s
picture
which
is
after
all
a
masterpiece
of
its
school
but
the
school
is
a
subordinate
one
and
save
to
the
student
of
flemish
art
his
is
not
a
name
one
does
not
say
for
instance
with
any
hope
of
general
recognition
ah
yes
that
reminds
me
of
such
and
such
a
bit
in
the
virgin
of
the
all
the
more
therefore
may
one
enjoy
his
picture
in
the
empty
room
of
the
rouen
gallery
with
that
gentle
sense
of
superiority
and
possessorship
to
which
the
discerner
of
obscure
merit
is
surely
entitled
how
much
of
its
charm
this
particular
painting
owes
to
its
not
having
become
the
of
the
how
much
to
its
own
intrinsic
beauty
its
grave
serenities
of
hue
and
gesture
how
much
above
all
to
the
heavenly
translucence
of
that
bunch
of
grapes
plucked
from
the
vines
of
paradise
it
is
part
of
its
very
charm
to
leave
unsettled
to
keep
among
the
mysteries
whereby
it
draws
one
back
only
one
trembles
lest
it
should
cease
to
shine
in
its
own
twilight
heaven
when
it
has
become
a
star
in
baedeker
iii
from
rouen
to
fontainebleau
the
seine
two
days
later
by
the
sweetest
curves
drew
us
on
from
rouen
to
les
andelys
past
such
bright
gardens
terraced
above
its
banks
such
moist
islands
such
low
green
promontories
deflecting
its
silver
flow
that
we
continually
checked
the
flight
of
the
motor
pausing
here
and
here
and
here
again
to
note
how
france
understands
and
enjoys
and
lives
with
her
rivers
with
her
great
past
it
seems
she
has
partly
ceased
to
live
for
ask
as
we
would
we
could
not
that
morning
learn
the
way
to
king
richard
s
château
gaillard
on
the
cliff
above
les
andelys
every
turn
from
the
route
de
paris
seemed
to
lead
straight
into
the
unknown
c
est
tout
droit
paris
was
the
invariable
answer
when
we
asked
our
way
yet
a
few
miles
off
were
two
of
the
quaintest
towns
of
france
the
little
and
great
andely
surmounted
by
a
fortress
marking
an
epoch
in
military
architecture
and
associated
with
the
fortunes
of
one
of
the
most
romantic
figures
in
history
and
we
knew
that
if
we
clung
to
the
windings
of
the
seine
they
must
lead
us
within
a
few
miles
to
the
place
we
sought
and
so
having
with
difficulty
disentangled
ourselves
from
the
route
de
paris
we
pushed
on
by
quiet
and
unknown
villages
by
of
grey
stone
peeping
through
high
thickets
of
lilac
and
laburnum
and
along
shady
where
fishermen
dozed
in
their
punts
and
cattle
in
the
beneath
the
willows
till
the
soft
slopes
broke
abruptly
into
tall
cliffs
shaggy
with
gorse
and
the
easy
flow
of
the
river
was
forced
into
a
sharp
twist
at
their
base
there
is
something
fantastic
in
this
sudden
change
of
landscape
near
les
andelys
from
the
familiar
french
to
what
might
be
one
of
piero
della
francesca
s
backgrounds
of
strangely
fretted
rock
and
scant
black
vegetation
while
the
seine
roused
from
its
progress
through
yielding
meadows
takes
a
majestic
bend
toward
the
little
andely
in
the
bay
of
the
cliffs
and
then
sweeps
out
below
the
height
on
which
planted
his
subtly
calculated
bastions
illustration
rouen
monument
of
the
cardinals
of
amboise
in
the
cathedral
ah
poor
fluttering
rag
of
a
ruin
so
thin
so
so
riddled
with
storm
and
shell
that
it
droops
on
its
rock
like
a
torn
banner
with
forgotten
victories
in
its
folds
how
much
more
eloquently
these
tottering
stones
tell
their
story
how
much
deeper
into
the
past
they
take
us
than
the
dapper
castles
pierrefonds
langeais
and
the
rest
on
which
the
has
worked
his
will
reducing
them
to
mere
museum
specimens
archæological
toys
from
which
all
the
growths
of
time
have
been
ruthlessly
stripped
the
eloquence
of
the
château
gaillard
lies
indeed
just
there
in
its
telling
us
so
discursively
so
plaintively
the
story
of
the
centuries
how
long
it
has
stood
how
much
it
has
seen
how
far
the
world
has
travelled
since
then
and
to
what
a
hoarse
cracked
whisper
the
voice
of
feudalism
and
chivalry
has
dwindled
the
town
that
once
cowered
under
the
protection
of
those
fallen
ramparts
still
groups
its
stout
old
houses
about
a
church
so
grey
and
venerable
yet
so
sturdily
planted
on
its
ancient
piers
that
one
might
fancy
its
compassionately
bidding
the
poor
ghost
of
a
fortress
come
down
and
take
shelter
beneath
its
vaultings
commune
and
castle
they
have
changed
places
with
the
shifting
fortunes
of
the
centuries
the
weak
growth
of
the
town
outstripping
the
arrogant
brief
bloom
of
the
fortress
richard
s
fair
daughter
of
one
year
which
had
called
it
arbitrarily
into
being
the
fortress
itself
is
now
no
more
than
one
of
the
of
the
muse
of
history
but
the
town
poor
little
accidental
offshoot
of
a
military
exigency
has
built
up
a
life
for
itself
become
an
abiding
centre
of
human
activities
though
by
an
accident
in
which
the
traveller
can
not
but
rejoice
it
still
keeps
in
spite
of
its
sound
masonry
and
air
of
ancient
health
that
almost
unmodernised
aspect
which
makes
some
little
french
burghs
recall
the
figure
of
a
lively
centenarian
all
his
faculties
still
active
but
wearing
the
dress
of
a
former
day
regaining
the
route
de
paris
we
passed
once
more
into
the
normal
seine
landscape
with
smiling
towns
on
its
shores
with
lilac
and
wistaria
pouring
over
high
walls
with
bright
little
cafés
on
sunny
village
squares
with
flotillas
of
moored
under
banks
never
more
vividly
than
in
this
seine
country
does
one
feel
the
amenity
of
french
manners
the
long
process
of
social
adaptation
which
has
produced
so
profound
and
general
an
intelligence
of
life
every
one
we
passed
on

philosophically
under

from
the
putting
a

of
in

appetising
window
to
the

who
had
just
come
out
to
drain
the

on
the

all
these
persons
under
which
designation

the
dog
took
their
ease
or
pursued
their
business
with
that
cheerful
activity
which
proceeds
from
an
intelligent
acceptance
of
given
conditions
they
each
had
their
established
niche
in

the
frankly
avowed
interests

which
seems
almost
as
if
it
were
a
moral
outcome
of
the
universal
french
sense
of
form
has
led
the
race
to
the
happy
the
momentous
discovery
that
good
manners
are
a
short
cut
to
one
s
goal
that
they
lubricate
the
wheels
of
life
instead
of
obstructing
them
this
discovery
the
result
as
it
strikes
one
of
the
application
of
the
finest
of
mental
instruments
to
the
muddled
process
of
living
seems
to
have
illuminated
not
only
the
social
relation
but
its
outward
concrete
expression
producing
a
finish
in
the
material
setting
of
life
a
kind
of
conformity
in
inanimate
things
forming
in
short
the
background
of
the
spectacle
through
which
we
pass
the
canvas
on
which
it
is
painted
and
expressing
itself
no
less
in
the
trimness
of
each
individual
garden
than
in
that
insistence
on
civic
dignity
and
comeliness
so
miraculously
maintained
through
every
torment
of
political
passion
every
change
of
social
conviction
by
a
people
resolutely
addressed
to
the
intelligent
enjoyment
of
living
by
vernon
with
its
trim
by
mantes
with
its
bright
gardens
and
the
graceful
church
which
dominates
its
square
we
passed
on
to
versailles
forsaking
the
course
of
the
seine
that
we
might
have
a
glimpse
of
the
country
about
fontainebleau
at
the
top
of
the
route
du
buc
which
climbs
by
sharp
windings
from
the
place
du
château
at
versailles
one
comes
upon
the
arches
of
the
aqueduct
of
buc
one
of
the
monuments
of
that
splendid
folly
which
created
the
golden
house
of
louis
xiv
and
drew
its
miraculous
groves
and
gardens
from
the
waterless
plain
of
versailles
the
aqueduct
forming
part
of
the
extravagant
scheme
of
irrigation
of
which
the
machine
de
marly
and
the
great
canal
of
maintenon
commemorate
successive
disastrous
phases
frames
in
its
useless
lofty
openings
such
charming
glimpses
of
the
country
to
the
southwest
of
versailles
that
it
takes
its
place
among
those
abortive
architectural
experiments
which
seem
after
all
to
have
been
completely
justified
by
time
illustration
le
petit
andely
view
of
the
town
and
château
gaillard
the
landscape
upon
which
the
arches
look
is
a
region
of
wood
and
vale
with
châteaux
at
the
end
of
long
green
vistas
and
old
flowery
villages
tucked
into
folds
of
the
hills
at
the
first
turn
of
the
road
above
versailles
the
suburbanism
of
the
parisian
environ
gives
way
to
the
real
look
of
the
country
and
smiling
still
but
tranquil
and
sweetly
shaded
with
big
farmyards
quiet
country
lanes
and
a
quiet
country
look
in
the
peasants
faces
in
passing
through
some
parts
of
france
one
wonders
where
the
inhabitants
of
the
châteaux
go
when
they
emerge
from
their
gates
so
interminably
beyond
those
gates
do
the
flat
fields
divided
by
straight
unshaded
roads
reach
out
to
every
point
of
the
compass
but
here
the
wooded
undulations
of
the
country
the
friendliness
of
the
villages
the
recurrence
of
big
rambling
some
apparently
the
remains
of
fortified
monastic
granges
all
suggest
the
possibility
of
something
resembling
the
english
rural
life
with
its
traditional
ties
between
park
and
fields
the
brief
journey
between
versailles
and
fontainebleau
offers
if
one
takes
the
longer
way
by
saint
and
etampes
a
succession
of
charming
impressions
more
varied
than
one
often
finds
in
a
long
day
s
through
france
and
midway
one
comes
upon
the
splendid
surprise
of
dourdan
ignorance
is
not
without
its
æsthetic
uses
and
to
drop
down
into
the
modest
old
town
without
knowing
or
having
forgotten
if
one
prefers
to
put
it
so
the
great
castle
of
philip
augustus
which
moated
dungeoned
still
possesses
its
peaceful
central
square
to
come
on
this
vigorous
bit
of
mediæval
arrogance
with
the
little
houses
of
dourdan
still
ducking
their
humble
roofs
to
it
in
an
obsequious
circle
well
to
taste
the
full
flavour
of
such
sensations
it
is
worth
while
to
be
of
a
country
where
the
last
new
or
office
building
is
the
only
monument
that
receives
homage
from
the
surrounding
architecture
dourdan
too
has
the
crowning
charm
of
an
old
inn
facing
its
such
an
inn
as
manon
and
des
grieux
dined
in
on
the
way
to
paris
where
in
a
large
courtyard
shaded
by
trees
one
may
feast
on
strawberries
and
cheese
at
a
table
enclosed
in
clipped
shrubs
with
dogs
and
pigeons
amicably
prowling
for
crumbs
and
the
host
and
hostess
their
ostlers
and
breakfasting
at
another
long
table
just
across
the
hedge
now
that
the
demands
of
the
motorist
are
introducing
modern
plumbing
and
maple
furniture
into
the
uttermost
parts
of
france
these
romantic
old
inns
where
it
is
charming
to
breakfast
if
precarious
to
sleep
are
becoming
as
rare
as
the
mediæval
keeps
with
which
they
are
in
a
way
contemporaneous
and
dourdan
is
fortunate
in
still
having
two
such
perfect
specimens
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
archæologist
etampes
our
next
considerable
town
seemed
by
contrast
rather
featureless
and
disappointing
yet
for
that
very
reason
so
typical
of
the
average
french
country
town
dry
compact
unsentimental
as
if
avariciously
hoarding
a
long
rich
past
that
its
one
straight
grey
street
and
squat
old
church
will
hereafter
always
serve
for
the
de
background
in
my
staging
of
french
fiction
beyond
etampes
as
one
approaches
fontainebleau
the
scenery
grows
extremely
picturesque
with
bold
outcroppings
of
blackened
rock
fields
of
golden
broom
groves
of
birch
and
pine
first
hints
of
the
fantastic
sandstone
scenery
of
the
forest
and
presently
the
long
green
aisles
opened
before
us
in
all
the
freshness
of
spring
verdure
tapering
away
right
and
left
to
distant
to
mossy
stone
crosses
and
obelisks
and
leading
us
toward
sunset
to
the
old
town
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
iv
the
loire
and
the
indre
fontainebleau
is
charming
in
may
and
at
no
season
do
its
glades
more
invitingly
detain
the
wanderer
but
it
belonged
to
the
familiar
the
part
of
our
itinerary
and
we
had
to
press
on
to
the
unexplored
so
after
a
day
s
roaming
of
the
forest
and
a
short
flight
to
moret
mediævally
seated
in
its
stout
walls
on
the
loing
we
started
on
our
way
to
the
loire
here
too
our
wheels
were
still
on
beaten
tracks
though
the
morning
s
flight
across
country
to
orléans
was
meant
to
give
us
a
glimpse
of
a
new
region
but
on
that
unhappy
morning
boreas
was
up
with
all
his
pack
and
hunted
us
savagely
across
the
naked
plain
now
behind
now
on
our
quarter
now
dashing
ahead
to
lie
in
ambush
behind
a
huddled
village
and
leap
on
us
as
we
rounded
its
last
house
the
plain
stretched
on
interminably
and
the
farther
it
stretched
the
harder
the
wind
raced
us
so
that
pithiviers
spite
of
dulcet
associations
appeared
to
our
shrinking
eyes
only
as
a
eagerly
striven
for
and
too
soon
gained
and
passed
and
when
at
we
beat
our
way
spent
and
wheezing
into
orléans
even
the
serried
memories
of
that
venerable
city
endeared
it
to
us
less
than
the
fact
that
it
had
an
inn
where
we
might
at
last
find
shelter
the
above
wholly
inadequate
description
of
an
interesting
part
of
france
will
have
convinced
any
rational
being
that
motoring
is
no
way
to
see
the
country
and
that
morning
it
certainly
was
not
but
then
what
of
the
afternoon
when
we
rolled
out
of
orléans
after
luncheon
both
the
day
and
the
scene
had
changed
and
what
other
form
of
travel
could
have
brought
us
into
such
communion
with
the
spirit
of
the
loire
as
our
smooth
flight
along
its
banks
in
the
bland
may
air
for
after
all
if
the
motorist
sometimes
misses
details
by
going
too
fast
he
sometimes
has
them
stamped
into
his
memory
by
an
opportune
puncture
or
a
recalcitrant
magneto
and
if
on
windy
days
he
has
to
rush
through
nature
blindfold
on
golden
afternoons
such
as
this
he
can
drain
every
drop
of
her
precious
essence
certainly
we
got
a
great
deal
of
the
loire
as
we
followed
its
windings
that
day
a
great
sense
of
the
steely
breadth
of
its
flow
the
amenity
of
its
shores
the
sweet
flatness
of
the
richly
gardened
and
vineyarded
landscape
as
of
a
highly
cultivated
but
slightly
insipid
society
an
impression
of
long
white
villages
and
of
stout
conical
towns
on
little
hills
of
old
brown
beaugency
in
its
cup
between
two
heights
and
madame
de
pompadour
s
ménars
on
its
bright
terraces
of
blois
nobly
bestriding
the
river
at
a
noble
bend
and
farther
south
of
yellow
cliffs
honeycombed
with
strange
dwellings
of
chaumont
and
amboise
crowning
their
towns
of
walled
gardens
rich
pastures
willowed
islands
and
then
toward
sunset
of
another
long
bridge
a
brace
of
fretted
and
the
widespread
roofs
of
tours
had
we
visited
by
rail
the
principal
places
named
in
this
itinerary
necessity
would
have
detained
us
longer
in
each
and
we
should
have
had
a
fuller
store
of
specific
impressions
but
we
should
have
missed
what
is
in
one
way
the
truest
initiation
of
travel
the
sense
of
continuity
of
relation
between
different
districts
of
familiarity
with
the
unnamed
unhistoried
region
stretching
between
successive
centres
of
human
history
and
exerting
in
deep
unnoticed
ways
so
persistent
an
influence
on
the
turn
that
history
takes
and
after
all
though
some
people
seem
to
doubt
the
fact
it
is
possible
to
stop
a
motor
and
get
out
of
it
and
if
on
our
way
down
the
loire
we
exercised
this
privilege
infrequently
it
was
because
here
again
we
were
in
a
land
of
old
acquaintance
of
which
the
general
topography
was
just
the
least
familiar
part
it
was
not
till
two
days
later
we
passed
out
of
tours
not
in
fact
till
we
left
to
the
northward
the
towered
pile
of
loches
that
we
found
ourselves
once
more
in
a
new
country
it
was
a
cold
day
of
high
clouds
and
flying
sunlight
just
the
sky
to
overarch
the
wide
rolling
landscape
through
which
the
turns
of
the
indre
were
leading
us
to
the
south
whither
we
were
bound
lay
the
berry
the
land
of
george
sand
while
to
the
northwest
low
acclivities
sloped
away
with
villages
shining
on
their
sides
one
arrow
of
sunlight
i
remember
transfixed
for
a
second
an
unknown
town
on
one
of
these
slopes
a
town
of
some
consequence
with
walls
and
towers
that
flashed
and
mysterious
across
the
cloudy
plain
who
has
not
been
tantalised
in
travelling
by
the
glimpse
of
such
cities
unnamed
undiscoverable
afterward
by
the
minutest
orientations
of
map
and
certainly
to
the
uninitiated
no
is
visible
on
that
particularly
level
section
of
the
map
of
france
yet
there
sloped
the
hill
there
shone
the
town
not
a
moment
s
mirage
but
the
companion
of
an
hour
s
travel
dominating
the
turns
of
our
road
beckoning
to
us
across
the
increasing
miles
and
causing
me
to
vow
as
we
lost
the
last
glimpse
of
its
towers
that
next
year
i
would
go
back
and
make
it
give
up
its
name

general
view

but
now
we
were
approaching
a
town
with
a
name
a
name
so
encrusted
and
overgrown
with
associations
that
it
was
undeniably
disappointing
as
we
reached
its
outskirts
to
find
châteauroux
aside
from
its
fine
old
château
on
the
indre
so
exactly
like
other
dull
french
towns
so
provokingly
unconscious
of
being
one
of
the
capital
cities
of
literature
and
it
seems
in
fact
literally
as
well
as
figuratively
unaware
of
its
distinction
fame
throws
its
circles
so
wide
that
it
makes
not
a
ripple
near
home
and
even
the
alert
landlady
of
the
hôtel

yet
here
was
the
northern
gate
of
the
sand
country
it
was
here
that
for
years
the
leaders
of
the
most
sedentary
profession
of
a
sedentary
race
the
de
of
france
descended
from
the
paris
express
and
took
a
diligence
on
their
pilgrimage
to
the
oracle
when
one
considers
the
fatigue
of
the
long
day
s
railway
journey
and
the
french
dread
of
the
continual
stream
of
greatness
that
paris
poured
out
upon
nohant
gives
the
measure
of
what
nohant
had
to
offer
in
return
as
we
sat
at
breakfast
in
the
inn
we
irreverently
pictured
some
of
these
great
personages

illustrious
figures
in
the
queer
dishabille
of

unwinding
strange
solicitous
for

seated
in
that
very
room
over
their
coffee
and
omelette
or
climbing
to
the
coupé
of
the
diligence
outside
and
then
we
set
out
on
the
same
road
straight
as
an
arrow
after
the
unvarying
fashion
of
the
french
government
highway
it
runs
southeast
through
vast
wheatfields
past
barns
and
farmhouses
grouped
as
in
the
vanished
of
infancy
now
touching
now
deserting
the
indre
banks
as
the
capricious
river
throws
its
loops
across
the
plain
but
presently
we
began
to
mount
insensibly
till
at
length
a
sharp
turn
and
an
abrupt
fall
of
the
land
brought
us
out
on
a
ridge
above
the
plain
of
the
berry
with
the
river
reappearing
below
and
far
far
south
a
blue
haze
of
mountains
the
road
after
that
descends
again
by
gentle
curves
acquainting
one
gradually
with
the
charming
details
of
the
foreground
copses
fields
hedged
with
hawthorn
long
lines
of
poplars
in
the
plain
while
all
the
way
the
distant
horizon
grows
richer
bluer
and
more
mysterious
it
is
a
wide
lonely
country
with
infrequent
villages
mere
hamlets
dotting
the
fields
one
sees
how
the
convivial
dudevant
coming
from
the
livelier
gascony
might
have
found
it
for
purposes
of
sociability
a
little
thinly
settled
at
one
of
these
small
lonely
villages
vicq
just
where
the
view
spreads
widest
the
road
loses
it
again
by
a
gradual
descent
of
a
mile
or
so
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
among
hawthorn
and
lilac
hedges
through
the
boughs
of
budding
trees
a
high
slate
roof
shows
to
the
left
the
roof
of
a
house
the
typical
of
the
french
no
other
house
is
in
sight
only
from
behind
the
trees
peep
two
or
three
humble
tiled
cottages
dependencies
of
the
larger
pile
there
is
nothing
to
tell
us
the
name
of
the
house
nothing
to
signalise
it
to
take
it
out
of
the
common
it
stands
there
large
placid
familiarly
related
to
the
and
the
farm
like
one
side
of
the
extraordinary
woman
it
sheltered
and
perhaps
that
fact
helps
to
suggest
its
name
to
render
almost
superfluous
our
breathless
question
to
the
pretty
knitting
under
the
hedge

pink

a
hawthorn
bud
a
kerchief
tied
about

curls
might
really
in
the
classic
phrase
of
sentimental
travel
have
stepped
out
of
one
of
the
novels
written
yonder
under
the
high
roof
to
which
she
pointed
she
had
the
honest
savour
of
the
yet
with
that
superadded
grace
that
the
author
of
the
novels
has
been
criticised
for
bestowing
on
her
peasants
she
formed
at
any
rate
a
charming
link
between
our
imagination
and
the
famous

we
presently
found
that
the
miracle
which
had
preserved
her
in
all
her

had
been
extended
to
the

privileged
spot

seemed
under
a
clear
glass

have
been
kept
intact

the

faces
diagonally
toward
the
road
from
which
a
high
wall
once
screened
it
but
it
is
written
in
the
de
ma
that
dudevant
in
a
burst
of
misdirected
activity
threw
down
several
yards
of
this
wall
and
filled
the
opening
with
a
hedge
the
hedge
is
still
there
and
thanks
to
this
impulse
of
destruction
the
traveller
obtains

in

on

grassy
place

in

would
pass
for
a
diminutive

which
under
an
ancient
stands
a
much
more
ancient

tiny

shrunken

a
few
yards
from
it
adjoining
the
court

lies
the
little
walled
graveyard

figures
so
often
in

where

described
it
now
rests
with
her
kin
the

defended

intrusion
by
a
high

a
locked

after
all
her
spirit
is
not
there

in

the

above
all
in
the
little
cluster
of
humble
old

shady
place
about

constituting
apparently
the
whole

the
these
little

surprisingly
picturesque
and
sentimental

their
mossy
roofs
their
clipped
yews

spinning
on
their
doorsteps

almost
too
ideal

and
when
at
last
excitedly
and
enchantedly
one
has
taken
in
the
quiet
perfection
of
it
all
and
turned
to
confront
the
great
question
does
a
sight
of
nohant
deepen
the
mystery
or
elucidate
it
one
can
only
answer
in
the
cautious
speech
of
the
new

casuist
for
if
it
helps
one
to
understand
one
side
of
george
sand
s
life
it
seems
actually
to
cast
a
thicker
obscurity
over
others
even
if
among
the
different
sides
contemplated
one
includes
only
those
directly
connected
with
the
place
and
not
the
innumerable
facets
that
reflected

and
majorca
the
first
surprise
is
to
find
the
place
on
the
whole
so
much
more
shall
one
say
dignified
and
decent
so
much
more
conscious
of
social
order
and
restraints
than
the
early
years
of
the
life
led
in
it
the
pictures
of
nohant
in
the
de
ma
are
unlike
any
other
description
of
french
provincial
manners
at
that
period
suggesting
rather
an
affinity
with
the
sombre
brontë
background
than
the
humdrum
but
conventional
and
orderly
existence
of
the
french
rural
gentry
when
one
recalls
the
throng
of
motley
characters
who
streamed
in
and
out
of
that
quiet
house
the
illegitimate
children
of
both
sides
living
in
harmony
with
one
another
and
with
the
child
of
wedlock
the
servants
the
peasant
playmates
the
drunken
boon
companions
when
one
turns
to
the
hogarthian
pictures
of
midnight
carouses
presided
over
by
the
uproarious
hippolyte
and
the
sombrely
tippling
dudevant
while
their
wives
sat
disgusted
but
apparently
tolerant
above
stairs
one
feels
one
s
self
in
the
sinister
gloom
of
wildfell
hall
rather
than
in
the
light
temperate
air
of
a
french
province
and
somehow
unreasonably
of
course
one
expects
the
house
to
bear
even
outwardly
some
mark
of
that
dark
disordered
period
or
if
not
then
of
the
cheerful
but
equally
incoherent
and
inconceivable
existence
led
there
when
the
timid
madame
dudevant
was
turning
into
the
great
george
sand
and
the
strange
procession
which
continued
to
stream
through
the
house
was
composed
no
longer
of
drunken
and
peasant
relations
but
of
an
almost
equally
fantastic
and
company
of
naturalists
journalists
riders
of
every
conceivable
religious
political
and
literary
hobby
among
whom
the
successive
tutors
of
the
adored
maurice
forming
in
themselves
a
line
as
long
as
the
kings
in
perhaps
take
the
palm
for
oddness
of
origin
and
adaptability
of
manners
one
expected
the
scene
of
these
confused
and
incessant
comings
and
goings
to
wear
the
injured
air
of
a
house
which
has
never
had
its
rights
respected
a
house
long
accustomed
to
jangle
its
in
vain
and
swing
its
broken
hinges
unheeded
and
instead
one
beholds
this
image
of
aristocratic
this
sober
edifice
conscious
in
every
line
of
its
place
in
the
social
scale
of
its
obligations
to
the
church
and
cottages
under
its
wing
its
rights
over
the
acres
surrounding
it
and
so
one
may
not
too
fancifully
recognise
in
it
the
image
of
those
grave
ideals
to
which
george
sand
gradually
conformed
the
passionate
experiment
of
her
life
may
even
indulge
one
s
self
by
imagining
that
an
old
house
so
marked
in
its
very
plainness
its
conformity
must
have
exerted
over
a
mind
as
sensitive
as
hers
an
unperceived
but
persistent
influence
giving
her
that
centralising
weight
of
association
and
habit
which
is
too
often
lacking
in
modern
character
and
standing
ever
before
her
as
the
shrine
of
those
household
pieties
to
which
inconsistently
enough
but
none
the
less
genuinely
the
devotion
of
her
last
years
was
paid
v
nohant
to
clermont
there
happened
to
us
on
leaving
nohant
what
had
happened
after
beauvais
the
quiet
country
house
by
the
roadside
like
the
mighty
gothic
choir
possessed
our
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
other
impressions
as
far
as
la
châtre
indeed
the
little
town
on
the
indre
where
young
madame
dudevant
spent
a
winter
to
further
her
husband
s
political
ambitions
we
were
still
within
the
nohant
radius
and
it
was
along
the
straight
road
we
were
travelling
that
poor
old
madame
dupin
de
francueil
that
she
could
hardly
make
the
round
of
the
garden
fled
in
her
slippers
on
the
fatal
night
when
her
son
returning
from
a
gay
supper
at
la
châtre
was
flung
from
his
horse
and
killed
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
these
scenes
from
the
de
ma
are
so
vivid
they
live
so
poignantly
in
memory
that
in
reliving
them
on
the
spot
one
feels
with
goncourt
how
great
their
writer
would
have
been
had
her
intrepid
pen
more
often
remained
le
la
châtre
is
a
charming
town
with
a
remarkably
picturesque
approach
on
the
nohant
side
across
an
old
bridge
out
of
which
an
old
house
with
a
steep
terraced
garden
seems
to
grow
with
the
conscious
pleasure
of
masonry
and
the
streets
beyond
have
an
air
of
ripe
experience
tempered
by
gaiety
like
that
of
those
ironic
old
faces
wherein
the
wrinkles
are
as
gay
as
dimples
southward
from
la
châtre
the
road
runs
through
a
beautiful
hilly
country
to
montluçon
on
the
cher
a
fine
old
border
town
with
a
brave
fighting
past
and
interesting
relics
of
bourbon
ascendancy
but
now
deeply
disfigured
by
hideous
factories
and
long
grimy
streets
of
operatives
houses
in
deploring
the
ravages
of
modern
industry
on
one
of
these
rare
old
towns
it
is
hard
to
remember
that
they
are
not
museum
pieces
but
settlements
of
human
beings
with
all
the
normal
desire
to
prosper
at
whatever
cost
to
the
physiognomy
of
their
birthplace
and
montluçon
in
especial
seems
to
have
been
a
very
pelican
to
the
greed
of
her
offspring
we
had
meant
to
spend
the
night
there
but
there
was
a
grimness
about
the
inn
the
special
grimness
of
which
the
commercial
travellers
hotel
in
the
french
manufacturing
town
holds
the
depressing
secret
that
forbade
even
a
glance
at
the
bedrooms
and
though
it
was
near
sunset
we
pressed
on
for
vichy
we
had
in
consequence
but
a
cold
twilight
glimpse
of
the
fine
gorge
of
montaigut
through
which
the
road
cuts
its
way
to
gannat
the
first
town
to
the
north
of
the
limagne
and
night
had
set
in
when
we
traversed
the
plain
of
the
allier
on
good
french
roads
however
a
by
night
is
not
without
its
compensations
and
our
dark
flight
through
mysterious
fields
and
woods
terminated
effectively
enough
with
the
long
descent
down
a
boulevard
into
the
inanimate
white
illustration
du
port
vichy
in
fact
had
barely
opened
the
shutters
of
its
fashionable
hotels
the
season
does
not
begin
till
june
and
in
may
only
a
few
premature
bathers
mostly
english
shiver
in
corners
of
the
marble
halls
or
disconsolately
peruse
last
year
s
news
in
the
deserted
but
even
in
this
stage
the
town
presented
itself
the
next
morning
as
that
rarest
of
spectacles
grace
triumphant
over
the
processes
of
the
toilet
only
a
pretty
woman
and
a
french
d
can
look
really
charming
in
morning
dishabille
and
the
way
in
which
vichy
accomplishes
the
feat
would
be
a
lesson
to
many
pretty
women
the
place
at
all
seasons
is
an
to
less
enlightened
municipalities
and
when
one
finds
one
s
self
vainly
wishing
that
art
and
history
and
all
the
rich
tapestry
of
the
past
might
somehow
be
brought
before
the
eyes
of
our
millions
one
might
pause
to
ask
if
the
sight
of
a
french
town
carefully
and
artistically
planned
as
a
setting
to
the
amenities
of
life
would
not
after
all
offer
the
more
salutary
and
surprising
example
vichy
even
among
french
towns
stands
out
as
a
singularly
finished
specimen
of
what
such
municipal
pride
can
accomplish
from
its
broad
flanked
by
hotels
and
by
the
arcades
of
the
casino
to
the
park
on
the
allier
and
the
wide
circumjacent
boulevards
it
wears
at
every
turn
the
same
trim
holiday
air
the
rouge
and
patches
of
smooth
gravel
bright
gay
shops
shady
benches
inviting
cafés
even
the
with
their
smart
and
victorias
drawn
by
plump
cobs
in
tinkling
harnesses
seem
part
of
a
where
all
that
is
usually
sordid
and
shabby
has
been
touched
by
the
magic
wand
of
trimness
or
where
some
utopian
millionaire
has
successfully
demonstrated
that
the
sordid
and
shabby
need
never
exist
at
all
but
to
the
american
observer
vichy
is
perhaps
most
instructive
just
because
it
is
not
the
millionaire
s
wand
which
has
worked
the
spell
because
the
town
owes
its
gaiety
and
its
elegance
not
to
the
private
villa
the
rich
man
s
showplace
but
to
wise
public
expenditure
of
the
money
which
the
bathers
annually
pour
into
its
exchequer
it
was
however
rather
for
the
sake
of
its
surroundings
than
for
the
study
of
its
unfolding
season
that
we
had
come
there
and
the
neighbouring
country
offered
the
richest
return
for
our
enterprise
from
the
plain
of
the
limagne
the
hills
slope
up
behind
vichy
in
a
succession
of
terraces
divided
by
streams
and
glens
and
connected
by
the
interlacing
of
admirable
roads
that
civilises
the
remotest
rural
districts
of
france
climbing
these
gradual
heights
to
the
of
ferrières
we
had
the
day
after
our
arrival
our
first
initiation
into
what
the
near
future
held
for
us
a
glorious
vision
across
the
plain
of
the
monts
dore
and
the
monts
de
dôme
the
blue
mountain
haze
that
had
drawn
us
steadily
southward
from
our
first
glimpse
of
it
on
the
heights
of
the
berry
now
resolved
itself
into
a
range
of
wild
volcanic
forms
some
curved
like
the
apses
of
the
churches
of
auvergne
some
slenderly
and
showing
the
hollow
rim
of
the
spent
crater
all
fantastic
individual
indescribably
differentiated
in
line
and
colour
from
mountain
forms
of
less
violent
origin
and
between
them
and
us
lay
the
richest
contrasting
landscape
the
deep
meadows
and
luxuriant
woodlands
of
the
allier
vale
with
here
and
there
a
volcanic
knoll
lifting
on
its
crest
an
old
town
or
a
castle
the
landscape
thus
viewed
presents
a
perplexing
mixture
of
suggestions
recalling
now
the
brown
of
umbria
now
the
robber
castles
of
the
swiss
rhineland
with
a
hint
again
of
the
terra
di
lavore
in
its
bare
mountain
lines
and
the
prodigal
fertility
of
their
lower
slopes
so
that
one
felt
one
s
self
moving
in
a
confusion
of
scenes
romantically
combined
as
in
the
foreground
of
a
claude
or
a
wilson
for
the
greater
pleasure
of
the
eclectic
eye
the
only
landscape
that
seems
to
have
been
excluded
from
the
composition
is
that
of
france
all
through
auvergne
we
never
felt
ourselves
in
france
but
that
is
of
course
merely
because
the
traveller
s
france
is
apt
to
be
mainly
made
up
of
bits
of
the
and
normandy
and
brittany
and
not
till
one
has
explored
the
central
and
southwestern
provinces
does
one
learn
of
the
countless
frances
within
france
and
realise
that
one
may
find
one
s
switzerland
one
s
italy
without
crossing
the
alps
to
reach
them
we
had
the
next
day
a
closer
impression
of
the
scene
we
had
looked
down
on
from
ferrières
motoring
first
along
the
high
ridge
above
the
limagne
to
the
ancient
black
of
thiers
and
thence
descending
again
to
the
plain
our
way
led
across
it
by
the
charming
castled
town
of
to
which
spreads
its
swarthy
mass
at
the
base
of
the
puy
de
dôme
that
strangest
sternest
of
cities
all
built
and
paved
in
the
black
volcanic
stone
of
volvic
and
crowned
by
the
sinister
splendour
of
its
black
cathedral
it
was
who
added
the
west
front
and
towers
to
this
high
ancient
pile
and
for
once
his
rash
hand
was
so
happily
inspired
that
at
the
first
glimpse
of
his
twin
spires
soaring
above
the
roofs
of
clermont
one
forgives
him
for
the
moment
the
wrong
he
did
to
blois
to
pierrefonds
and
vézelay
vi
in
auvergne
at
last
we
were
really
in
auvergne
on
our
balcony
at
royat
just
under
the
flank
of
the
puy
de
dôme
we
found
ourselves
in
close
communion
with
its
tossed
heights
its
black
towns
its
threatening
castles
and
royat
itself
even
the
dull
new
quarter
is
extremely
characteristic
of
the
region
hanging
in
a
cleft
of
the
great
volcanic
upheaval
with
hotels
villas
gardens
vineyards
clutching
precariously
at
every
ledge
and
fissure
as
though
just
arrested
in
their
descent
on
the
roofs
of
clermont
as
a
royat
is
not
an
ornamental
specimen
of
its
class
and
it
has
the
farther
disadvantage
of
being
connected
with
clermont
by
a
long
dusty
suburb
noisy
with
but
as
a
centre
for
excursions
it
offers
its
good
hotels
and
modern
conveniences
at
the
precise
spot
most
favourable
to
the
motorist
who
may
radiate
from
it
upon
almost
every
centre
of
interest
in
auvergne
and
return
at
night
to
digestible
food
and
clean
beds
two
requisites
for
which
in
central
france
one
is
often
doomed
to
pine
auvergne
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
hitherto
almost
the
least
known
of
the
old
french
provinces
offers
two
distinct
and
equally
striking
sides
to
the
appreciative
traveller
on
the
one
hand
its
remarkably
individual
church
architecture
and
on
the
other
the
no
less
personal
character
of
its
landscape
almost
all
its
towns
are
distinguished
by
one
of
those
ancient
swarthy
churches
with
western
narthex
great
central
tower
and
curious
incrustations
of
polychrome
lava
which
marked
in
auvergne
as
strongly
distinctive
an
architectural
impulse
as
flowered
on
a
vastly
larger
scale
and
a
century
or
more
later
in
the
gothic
of
the
ile
de
france
and
the
towns
surrounding
these
churches
on
the
crest
or
flank
of
one
of
the
volcanic
eminences
springing
from
the
plain
the
towns
themselves
with
their
narrow
perpendicular
streets
and
tall
black
houses
are
so
darkly
individual
so
plainly
akin
to
the
fierce
predatory
castles
on
the
neighbouring
hills
that
one
is
arrested
at
every
turn
by
the
desire
to
follow
up
the
obscure
threads
of
history
connecting
them
with
this
portion
of
the
rich
french
past
but
to
the
traveller
restricted
by
time
the
other
side
of
the
picture
its
background
rather
of
tormented
blue
peaks
and
forest
which
must
assert
itself
at
all
seasons
quite
as
distinctively
as
the
historic
and
architectural
character
of
the
towns
is
likely
in
may
to
carry
off
the
victory
we
had
come
at
any
rate
with
the
modest
purpose
of
taking
a
mere
bird
view
of
the
region
such
a
flight
across
the
scene
as
draws
one
back
later
to
brood
and
hover
and
our
sight
of
the
landscape
from
the
royat
balcony
confirmed
us
in
the
resolve
to
throw
as
sweeping
a
glance
as
possible
and
defer
the
study
of
details
to
our
next
our
visit
the
following
morning
therefore
we
set
out
early
for
the
heart
of
the
monts
dore
our
road
carried
us
southward
along
a
series
of
ridges
above
the
wide
allier
vale
and
then
up
and
down
over
wild
volcanic
hills
now
densely
wooded
now
desolately
bare
we
were
on
the
road
to
issoire
and
la
chaise
dieu
two
of
the
most
notable
old
towns
of
southern
auvergne
but
in
pursuit
of
scenery
we
reluctantly
turned
off
at
the
village
of
coudes
at
the
mouth
of
a
lateral
valley
and
struck
up
toward
the
western
passes
which
lead
to
the
pic
de
sancy
some
miles
up
this
valley
which
follows
the
capricious
windings
of
the
couzes
lie
the
baths
of
saint
romantically
planted
in
a
narrow
defile
beneath
the
pyramidal
romanesque
church
which
the
original
village
lifts
up
on
a
steep
splinter
of
rock
the
landscape
beyond
saint
nectaire
grows
more
rugged
and
alpine
in
character
the
pastures
have
a
swiss
look
and
the
shaggy
are
clothed
with
a
northern
growth
of
beech
and
pine
presently
at
a
turn
of
the
road
we
came
on
the
little
of
chambon
its
vivid
blueness
set
in
the
greenest
of
meadows
and
overhung
by
the
dark
basalt
cliff
which
carries
on
its
summit
the
fortified
castle
of
murols
the
situation
of
murols
lifted
on
its
shaft
of
rock
above
that
lonely
upland
valley
is
in
itself
impressive
enough
to
bring
out
the
full
value
of
such
romantic
suggestions
as
it
has
to
offer
and
the
monument
is
worthy
of
its
site
it
is
in
fact
a
very
noble
ruin
raising
its
central
keep
above
two
outer
circuits
of
battered
masonry
the
ampler
and
later
of
which
shows
the
classical
pilasters
and
large
fenestration
of
what
must
have
been
one
of
the
stateliest
specimens
of
the
last
stage
of
french
feudal
architecture
though
the
guidebooks
record
a
mention
of
murols
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
the
castle
now
standing
is
all
of
later
date
and
the
great
rectangular
exterior
is
an
interesting
example
of
the
transitional
period
when
italian
palace
architecture
began
to
be
grafted
on
the
rugged
stock
of
french
military
construction
just
beyond
the
lake
of
chambon
the
road
begins
to
mount
the
long
curves
of
the
col
de
diane
the
pass
which
leads
over
into
the
valley
of
mont
dore
as
we
rose
through
bleak
meadows
and
patches
of
scant
woodland
the
mountains
of
auvergne
unrolled
themselves
to
the
east
in
one
of
those
lonely
tossing
expanses
of
summit
and
ridge
and
chasm
that
suggest
the
mysterious
undulations
of
some
uninhabited
planet
though
the
col
de
diane
is
not
a
high
pass
it
gives
from
its
yoke
a
strangely
memorable
impression
of
distance
and
mystery
partly
perhaps
because
in
that
desert
region
there
is
neither
village
nor
house
to
break
the
labyrinth
of
peaks
but
chiefly
because
of
the
convulsed
outlines
into
which
they
have
been
tossed
by
subterranean
fires
a
cold
wind
swept
the
top
of
the
pass
and
snow
still
lay
under
the
rocks
by
the
roadside
so
that
it
was
cheering
to
the
spirits
as
well
as
to
the
eye
when
we
presently
began
our
descent
through
dark
pine
forests
into
the
vale
of
the
dordogne
the
baths
of
mont
dore
lie
directly
beneath
the
pass
at
the
mouth
of
a
valley
hollowed
out
of
the
side
of
the
pic
de
sancy
the
highest
peak
in
auvergne
in
spite
of
milder
air
and
bright
spring
foliage
we
were
still
distinctly
in
high
places
and
mont
dore
itself
not
yet
decked
for
the
entertainment
of
its
bathers
had
the
look
which
everywhere
marks
the
real
mountain
village
later
no
doubt
when
its
hotels
are
open
and
its
scanty
gardens
in
bloom
it
takes
on
a
thin
veneer
of
frivolity
but
it
must
always
be
an
village
with
its
streets
and
gaunt
stone
houses
grouped
against
a
background
of
alpine
pastures
we
were
not
sorry
therefore
that
its
few
restaurants
presented
barred
shutters
to
our
hunger
and
that
we
were
obliged
to
follow
the
first
footsteps
of
the
infant
dordogne
down
the
valley
to
the
baths
of
bourboule
the
dordogne
is
a
child
of
lusty
growth
and
at
its
very
leap
from
the
cradle
under
the
pic
de
sancy
it
rolls
a
fine
brown
torrent
beneath
steeply
wooded
banks
its
course
led
us
rapidly
down
the
mountain
glen
to
the
amiable
but
somewhat
characterless
little
of
la
bourboule
set
in
a
depression
of
the
hills
with
a
background
of
slopes
which
in
summer
might
offer
fairly
pleasant
walks
between
one
s
douches
and
here
at
a
fresh
white
hotel
with
an
affable
landlady
we
lunched
on
trout
that
must
have
leapt
straight
from
the
dordogne
into
the
illustration
orcival
the
church
after
luncheon
we
once
more
took
our
way
along
the
lively
curves
of
the
river
to
part
with
them
at
last
reluctantly
a
few
miles
down
the
valley
and
strike
out
across
a
dull
plateau
to
the
mountain
town
of
laqueille
a
gaunt
place
with
nothing
of
note
to
offer
except
its
splendid
view
from
the
dizzy
verge
of
a
high
cornice
which
overhangs
the
valley
running
south
from
the
chain
of
the
dôme
beyond
laqueille
again
we
began
to
descend
by
long
windings
and
at
last
turning
off
from
the
direct
road
to
royat
we
engaged
ourselves
in
a
series
of
wooded
gorges
in
search
of
the
remote
village
of
orcival
the
church
of
orcival
is
one
of
the
most
noted
of
that
strange
group
of
auvergnat
churches
which
some
students
of
french
romanesque
are
disposed
to
attribute
not
only
to
one
brief
period
of
time
but
to
the
hand
of
one
architect
so
closely
are
they
allied
not
alone
in
plan
and
construction
but
in
their
peculiar
and
original
decorative
details
we
had
resolved
therefore
not
to
return
to
royat
without
a
sight
of
orcival
and
spite
of
the
misleading
directions
plentifully
bestowed
on
us
by
the
way
and
resulting
in
endless
doublings
through
narrow
lonely
glens
we
finally
came
in
the
neck
of
the
last
and
narrowest
upon
a
huddled
group
of
stone
roofs
with
a
church
rising
nobly
above
them
here
it
was
at
last
and
our
first
glance
told
us
how
well
worth
the
search
we
had
made
for
it
but
a
second
made
evident
the
disturbing
fact
that
a
was
going
on
in
the
village
and
though
this
is
not
an
unusual
event
in
french
towns
or
one
calculated
in
general
to
interfere
with
the
movements
of
the
sightseer
we
soon
saw
that
owing
to
the
peculiar
position
of
orcival
which
is
jammed
into
the
head
of
its
glen
as
tightly
as
a
cork
in
a
bottle
the
occupation
of
the
square
about
the
church
formed
a
complete
check
to
circulation
and
the
square
was
fully
occupied
it
presented
as
we
descended
on
it
an
agitated
surface
of
blue
human
backs
and
dun
and
white
bovine
ones
so
closely
and
inextricably
mixed
that
any
impact
from
without
merely
sent
a
wave
across
the
mass
without
making
the
slightest
break
in
its
substance
on
its
edge
therefore
we
halted
the
church
with
its
beautiful
rounded
and
central
islanded
a
few
yards
away
across
a
horned
sea
which
divided
it
from
us
as
hopelessly
as
egypt
from
israel
and
the
waves
of
the
sea
setting
toward
us
with
somewhat
threatening
intent
at
the
least
sign
of
our
attempting
to
cross
it
there
was
therefore
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
own
ourselves
intruders
and
defer
a
sight
of
orcival
till
our
next
visit
and
with
much
backing
and
wriggling
and
some
unfavourable
comment
on
the
part
of
the
opposition
we
effected
a
crestfallen
exit
from
that
interesting
but
inhospitable
village
the
road
thence
to
royat
climbs
over
the
long
col
de
ceyssat
close
under
the
southern
side
of
the
puy
de
dôme
and
we
looked
up
longingly
at
the
bare
top
of
the
mountain
yearning
to
try
the
ascent
but
fearing
that
our
was
not
pitched
to
such
heights
that
adventure
too
was
therefore
deferred
till
our
next
visit
which
every
renunciation
of
the
kind
was
helping
to
bring
nearer
and
make
more
inevitable
and
we
pushed
on
to
royat
across
the
plain
of
laschamp
noted
in
the
records
of
motoring
as
the
of
the
perilous
d
vii
royat
to
bourges
the
term
of
our
holiday
was
upon
us
and
stern
necessity
took
us
back
the
next
day
to
vichy
we
followed
this
time
the
road
along
the
western
side
of
the
limagne
passing
through
the
old
towns
of
riom
and
aigueperse
riom
thanks
to
its
broad
boulevards
and
bright
open
squares
struck
us
as
the
most
cheerful
and
animated
place
we
had
seen
in
auvergne
and
it
has
besides
a
great
air
of
renaissance
elegance
many
of
its
old
traceried
hôtels
having
been
built
in
the
sixteenth
century
which
saw
the
chief
development
of
the
town
aigueperse
on
the
contrary
spite
of
its
situation
in
the
same
sunny
luxuriant
plain
presents
the
morose
aspect
of
the
typical
town
of
auvergne
without
many
compensating
merits
save
that
of
two
striking
pictures
of
the
italian
school
which
are
to
be
seen
in
its
modernised
cathedral
from
aigueperse
our
road
struck
eastward
across
the
limagne
to
gannat
and
thence
through
pleasant
fields
and
woods
we
returned
to
vichy
on
the
opposite
edge
of
the
plain
we
started
early
the
next
morning
on
our
journey
to
the
north
for
our
slight
experience
of
the
inns
of
central
france
made
us
anxious
to
reach
orléans
by
night
such
long
runs
can
not
be
made
without
the
sacrifice
of
much
that
charms
and
arrests
one
by
the
way
and
this
part
of
the
country
should
be
seen
at
leisure
in
the
long
summer
days
when
the
hotels
are
less
sepulchrally
damp
and
when
one
can
remain
late
out
of
doors
instead
of
having
to
shiver
through
the
evening
hours
around
a
smoky
in
a
room
which
will
not
bear
inspection
even
by
that
inadequate
light
we
suffered
i
remember
many
pangs
by
the
way
and
not
least
that
of
having
to
take
as
a
mere
parenthesis
the
charmingly
complete
little
town
of
la
palisse
on
the
bèbre
with
the
ruined
ivied
castle
of
the
comtes
de
chabannes
overhanging
a
curve
of
the
river
and
grouping
itself
in
a
memorable
composition
with
the
picturesque
houses
below
it
farther
north
again
moulins
on
the
allier
inflicted
a
still
deeper
pang
for
this
fine
old
town
has
considerable
claims
to
distinction
besides
the
great
triptych
that
made
its
name
known
through
europe
after
the
recent
exhibition
of
french
primitives
in
paris
the
virgin
of
moulins
gloriously
enthroned
in
the
cathedral
among
her
lombard
angels
remains
undoubtedly
the
crowning
ornament
of
the
town
if
only
on
account
of
the
problem
which
she
holds
out
so
inscrutably
to
explorers
of
the
baffling
annals
of
early
french
art
but
aside
from
this
preëminent
possession
and
the
interest
of
several
minor
relics
moulins
has
the
attraction
of
its
own
amiable
and
distinguished
physiognomy
with
its
streets
of
stone
its
handsome
hôtels
and
broad
it
seemed
after
the
grim
black
towns
of
the
south
a
singularly
open
and
cheerful
place
and
one
was
conscious
behind
the
handsome
stone
gateways
and
balconied
façades
of
the
existence
of
old
panelled
with
pastel
portraits
and
faded
tapestry
furniture
the
approach
to
nevers
the
old
capital
of
the
nivernais
carried
us
abruptly
back
to
the
middle
ages
but
to
an
exuberant
northern
mediævalism
far
removed
from
the
tradition
of
central
france
the
cathedral
of
nevers
with
its
ornate
portals
and
fantastically
decorated
has
in
the
old
ducal
palace
across
the
square
a
rival
more
than
capable
of
meeting
its
challenge
on
equal
grounds
a
building
of
really
gallant
exterior
with
fine
angle
towers
and
within
a
great
staircase
commemorating
in
luxuriant
sculpture
the
legendary
beginnings
of
that
ancient
house
of
cleves
which
in
the
fifteenth
century
allied
itself
by
marriage
with
the
dukes
of
burgundy
at
nevers
we
found
ourselves
once
more
on
the
loire
but
only
to
break
from
it
again
in
a
long
dash
across
country
to
bourges
at
this
point
we
left
behind
us
the
charming
diversified
scenery
which
had
accompanied
us
to
the
borders
of
the
loire
and
entered
on
a
region
of
low
monotonous
undulations
flattening
out
gradually
into
the
vast
about
bourges
but
who
would
wish
any
other
setting
for
that
memorable
silhouette
throned
from
whichever
point
of
the
compass
one
approaches
it
in
such
proud
isolation
above
the
plain
one
forgets
even
in
a
distant
view
of
bourges
that
nature
has
helped
by
an
opportune
rise
of
the
ground
to
lift
the
cathedral
to
its
singular
eminence
the
hill
and
the
town
upon
it
seem
so
merely
the
unremarked
pedestal
of
the
monument
it
is
not
till
one
climbs
the
steep
street
leading
up
from
the
place
saint
bonnet
that
one
realises
the
peculiar
topographical
advantages
of
such
a
site
advantages
which
perhaps
partly
account
for
the
overwhelming
and
not
quite
explicable
effect
of
a
first
sight
of
the
cathedral
illustration
moulins
place
de
l
and
the
jacquemart
tower
even
now
on
a
second
visit
with
the
great
monuments
of
the
ile
de
france
fresh
in
memory
we
felt
the
same
effect
and
the
same
difficulty
in
running
it
down
in
differentiating
it
from
the
richer
yet
perhaps
less
deeply
gothic
impression
produced
by
the
rival
churches
of
the
north
for
begin
as
one
will
by
admitting
by
insisting
upon
the
defects
of
bourges
its
irregular
inharmonious
façade
its
thin
piers
its
mean
outer
aisles
one
yet
ends
in
a
state
where
criticism
perforce
yields
to
sensation
where
one
surrenders
one
s
self
wholly
to
the
spell
of
its
spiritual
suggestion
certainly
it
would
be
hard
to
put
a
finger
either
within
or
without
on
the
specific
tangible
cause
of
this
feeling
is
it
to
be
found
in
the
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
five
western
portals
so
crowded
with
noble
and
pathetic
imagery
and
delicate
ornamental
detail
but
the
doors
of
chartres
surpass
even
these
is
it
then
if
one
looks
within
the
rich
blue
and
red
of
its
dense
ancient
glass
but
chartres
again
has
finer
glass
of
that
unmatched
period
is
it
the
long
clear
sweep
of
the
nave
and
aisles
uninterrupted
by
the
of
transept
or
but
if
one
recalls
the
wonderful
convolutions
of
the
ambulatory
of
canterbury
one
has
to
confess
that
gothic
art
even
in
its
conventionalised
english
form
has
created
curves
of
greater
poetry
and
mystery
produced
a
more
thrilling
sense
of
shadowy
consecrated
distances
perhaps
the
spell
of
bourges
resides
in
a
fortunate
accidental
mingling
of
many
of
the
qualities
that
predominate
in
this
or
that
more
perfect
structure
in
the
mixing
of
the
ingredients
so
that
there
rises
from
them
as
one
stands
in
one
of
the
lofty
inner
aisles
with
one
s
face
toward
the
choir
that
breath
of
mystical
devotion
which
issues
from
the
very
heart
of
mediæval
christianity
with
this
sweetness
wrote
saint
theresa
of
the
prayer
of
quiet
the
whole
inner
and
outer
man
seems
to
be
delighted
as
though
some
delicious
ointment
were
poured
into
the
soul
like
an
exquisite
perfume
as
if
we
suddenly
came
to
a
place
where
it
is
exhaled
not
only
from
one
but
from
many
things
and
we
know
not
what
it
is
or
from
which
one
of
them
it
comes
but
they
all
penetrate
us
if
amiens
in
its
harmony
of
conception
and
vigour
of
execution
seems
to
embody
the
developing
of
a
people
passionate
in
belief
and
indomitable
in
the
concrete
expression
of
their
creed
here
at
bourges
one
feels
that
other
less
expressible
side
of
the
great
ruling
influence
of
the
middle
ages
the
power
that
willed
mighty
monuments
and
built
them
yet
also
even
in
its
moments
of
most
brutal
material
ascendancy
created
the
other
houses
not
built
with
hands
where
the
spirits
of
the
saints
might
dwell
part
ii
i
paris
to
poitiers
spring
again
and
the
long
white
road
unrolling
itself
southward
from
paris
how
could
one
resist
the
call
we
answered
it
on
the
blandest
of
late
march
mornings
all
april
in
the
air
and
the
seine
fringing
itself
with
a
mist
of
yellowish
willows
as
we
rose
over
it
climbing
the
hill
to
ville
d
avray
spring
comes
soberly
inaudibly
as
it
were
in
these
temperate
european
lands
where
the
grass
holds
its
green
all
winter
and
the
foliage
of
ivy
laurel
holly
and
countless
other
evergreen
shrubs
links
the
lifeless
to
the
living
months
but
the
mere
act
of
climbing
that
southern
road
above
the
seine
meadows
seemed
as
definite
as
the
turning
of
a
leaf
the
passing
from
a
page
to
one
illuminated
and
every
day
now
would
turn
a
brighter
page
for
us
goethe
has
a
charming
verse
descriptive
it
is
supposed
of
his
first
meeting
with
christiane
vulpius
aimlessly
i
strayed
through
the
wood
it
in
my
mind
to
seek
such
precisely
was
our
state
of
mind
on
that
first
day
s
run
we
were
simply
pushing
south
toward
the
berry
through
a
more
or
less
familiar
country
and
the
real
journey
was
to
begin
for
us
on
the
morrow
with
the
run
from
châteauroux
to
poitiers
but
we
reckoned
without
our
france
it
is
easy
enough
glancing
down
the
long
page
of
the
guide
continental
to
slip
by
such
names
as
versailles
rambouillet
chartres
and
valençay
in
one
s
dash
for
the
objective
point
but
there
is
no
slipping
by
them
in
the
motor
they
lurk
there
in
one
s
path
throwing
out
great
loops
of
persuasion
arresting
one
s
flight
complicating
one
s
impressions
oppressing
bewildering
one
with
the
renewed
sense
of
the
hoarded
richness
of
france
illustration
bourges
apse
of
the
cathedral
versailles
first
unfolding
the
pillared
expanse
of
its
north
façade
to
vast
empty
perspectives
of
radiating
avenues
then
rambouillet
low
in
a
damp
little
park
with
statues
along
green
canals
and
a
look
this
moist
march
weather
of
being
somewhat
below
then
maintenon
its
rich
walls
and
delicate
stone
ornament
reflected
in
the
moat
dividing
it
from
the
village
street
both
rambouillet
and
maintenon
are
characteristically
french
in
their
way
of
keeping
company
with
their
villages
rambouillet
indeed
is
slightly
screened
by
a
tall
gate
a
wall
and
trees
but
maintenon
s
warm
red
turrets
look
across
the
moat
straight
into
the
windows
of
the
opposite
houses
with
the
simple
familiarity
of
a
time
when
class
distinctions
were
too
fixed
to
need
emphasising
our
third
château
valençay
which
for
comparison
s
sake
one
may
couple
with
the
others
though
it
lies
far
south
of
blois
valençay
bears
itself
with
greater
aloofness
bidding
the
town
keep
its
distance
down
the
hill
on
which
the
great
house
lifts
its
heavy
and
flattened
domes
a
huge
wall
enclosing
the
whole
southern
flank
of
the
hill
supports
the
terraced
gardens
before
the
château
which
to
the
north
is
divided
from
the
road
by
a
vast
d
with
a
monumental
grille
and
gateway
the
impression
is
grander
yet
less
noble
illustration
château
of
maintenon
but
france
is
never
long
content
to
repeat
her
effects
and
between
maintenon
and
valençay
she
puts
chartres
and
blois
ah
these
grey
old
cathedral
towns
with
their
narrow
clean
streets
widening
to
a
central
at
chartres
a
beautiful
oval
like
the
in
an
print
with
their
clipped
high
garden
walls
balzacian
gables
looking
out
on
sunless
lanes
under
the
flanks
of
the
granite
giant
save
in
the
church
itself
how
frugally
all
the
effects
are
produced
with
how
sober
a
use
of
greys
and
blacks
and
pale
high
lights
as
in
some
van
der
meer
interior
yet
how
intense
a
suggestion
of
thrifty
compact
traditional
life
one
gets
from
the
low
the
barred
gates
the
glimpses
of
clean
bare
courts
the
calm
yet
quick
faces
in
the
doorways
from
these
faces
again
one
gets
the
same
impression
of
remarkable
effects
produced
by
the
discreetest
means
the
french
physiognomy
if
not
vividly
beautiful
is
vividly
intelligent
but
the
long
practice
of
manners
has
so
veiled
its
keenness
with
refinement
as
to
produce
a
blending
of
vivacity
and
good
temper
nowhere
else
to
be
matched
and
in
looking
at
it
one
feels
once
more
as
one
so
often
feels
in
trying
to
estimate
french
architecture
or
the
french
landscape
how
much
of
her
total
effect
france
achieves
by
elimination
if
marked
beauty
be
absent
from
the
french
face
how
much
more
is
marked
dulness
marked
brutality
the
lumpishness
of
the
clumsily
made
and
the
unfinished
as
a
mere
piece
of
workmanship
of
finish
the
french
provincial
face
the
peasant
s
face
even
often
has
the
same
kind
of
interest
as
a
work
of
art
one
gets
after
repeated
visits
to
the
show
towns
of
france
to
feel
these
minor
characteristics
the
incidental
graces
of
the
foreground
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
the
great
official
spectacle
in
the
centre
of
the
picture
so
that
while
the
first
image
of
bourges
or
chartres
is
that
of
a
cathedral
surrounded
by
a
blur
later
memories
of
the
same
places
present
a
vividly
individual
town
with
doorways
faces
intensely
remembered
and
in
the
centre
a
great
cloudy
gothic
splendour
at
chartres
the
cloudy
splendour
is
shot
through
with
such
effulgence
of
colour
that
its
vision
evoked
by
memory
seems
to
beat
with
a
fiery
life
of
its
own
as
though
red
blood
ran
in
its
stone
veins
it
is
this
suffusion
of
heat
and
radiance
that
chiefly
to
the
untechnical
distinguishes
it
from
the
other
great
gothic
interiors
in
all
the
rest
colour
if
it
exists
at
all
burns
in
scattered
unquiet
patches
between
wastes
of
shadowy
grey
stone
and
the
wan
pallor
of
later
painted
glass
but
at
chartres
those
quivering
waves
of
unearthly
red
and
blue
flow
into
and
repeat
each
other
in
rivers
of
light
from
their
source
in
the
great
western
rose
down
the
length
of
the
vast
aisles
and
clerestory
till
they
are
gathered
up
at
last
into
the
mystical
heart
of
the
apse
a
short
afternoon
s
run
carried
us
through
dullish
country
from
chartres
to
blois
which
we
reached
at
the
fortunate
hour
when
sunset
burnishes
the
great
curves
of
the
loire
and
lays
a
bloom
on
the
slate
roofs
overlapping
the
slope
below
the
castle
there
are
few
finer
than
this
from
the
wall
at
blois
the
blue
sweep
of
gables
and
billowing
up
here
and
there
into
a
church
tower
with
its
mailed
in
slate
or
breaking
to
let
through
the
glimpse
of
a
carved
façade
or
the
blossoming
depths
of
a
hanging
garden
but
perhaps
only
the
eye
subdued
to
tin
housetops
and
iron
can
feel
the
full
poetry
of
old
roofs
coming
back
to
the
berry
six
weeks
earlier
than
on
our
last
year
s
visit
we
saw
how
much
its
wide
landscape
needs
the
relief
and
modelling
given
by
the
varied
foliage
of
may
between
bare
woods
and
scarcely
budded
hedges
the
great
meadows
looked
bleak
and
monotonous
and
only
the
village
gardens
hung
out
a
visible
promise
of
spring
but
in
the
sheltered
enclosure
at
nohant
spring
seemed
much
nearer
at
hand
already
in
clumps
of
and
violets
loosening
the
soil
in
young
red
leaves
on
the
and
the
twitter
of
birds
in
the
heavy
ivy
of
the
graveyard
wall
a
gate
leads
from
the
garden
into
the
corner
of
the
graveyard
where
george
sand
and
her
children
lie
under
an
ancient
yew
feudal
even
in
burial
they
are
walled
off
from
the
village
dead
and
the
tombstone
of
maurice
sand
as
well
as
the
monstrous
stone
chest
over
his
mother
s
grave
bears
the
name
of
dudevant
and
asserts
a
claim
to
the
barony
strange
inconsequence
of
human
desires
that
the
woman
who
had
made
her
pseudonym
illustrious
enough
to
have
it
assumed
by
her
whole
family
should
cling
in
death
to
the
obscure
name
of
a
repudiated
husband
more
inconsequent
still
that
the
descendant
of
kings
and
the
priestess
of
democracy
and
fourierism
should
insist
on
a
right
to
the
petty
title
which
was
never
hers
since
it
was
never
dudevant
s
to
give
on
the
whole
the
gravestones
at
nohant
are
disillusioning
except
indeed
that
of
the
wretched
solange
with
its
four
tragic
words
mère
de
but
the
real
meaning
of
the
place
must
be
sought
close
by
behind
the
row
of
tall
windows
opening
on
the
tangled
mossy
garden
they
lead
these
windows
straight
into
the
life
of
george
sand
into
the
big
cool
with
its
flagged
floor
and
simple
walls
and
the
adjoining
the
alas
so
radically
remodelled
in
the
unhappy
period
of
stuffed
furniture
and
centre
table
that
one
seeks
in
vain
for
a
trace
of
the
original
chatelaine
of
nohant
that
old
madame
dupin
who
still
haunts
the
panelled
and
the
garden
yet
the
has
its
special
story
to
tell
for
in
george
sand
s
culminating
time
just
such
a
long
table
with
fringed
cover
and
encircling
formed
the
centre
of
french
indoor
life
about
this
elongated
board
sat
the
great
woman
s
illustrious
visitors
prolonging
as
at
a
mental
d
that
interminable
which
still
strikes
the
hurried
as
the
typical
expression
of
french
sociability
and
here
the
different
arts
of
the
household
were
practised
the
painting
carving
and
fine
which
a
generation
managed
to
carry
on
by
the
light
of
a
single
lamp
here
one
likes
especially
to
fancy
maurice
sand
exercised
his
chisel
on
the
famous
marionettes
for
the
little
theatre
while
his
mother
fitting
their
costumes
with
skilful
fingers
listened
silent
une
to
the
dissertations
of
gautier
flaubert
or
dumas
the
earlier
life
of
the
house
still
speaks
moreover
from
the
walls
of
the
with
the
voice
of
jealously
treasured
ancestral
portraits
pictures
of
the
demoiselles
verrières
of
the
great
marshal
and
the
beautiful
aurora
strange
memorials
of
a
past
which
explains
so
much
in
the
history
of
george
sand
even
to
the
tempestuous
face
of
solange
clésinger
looking
darkly
across
the
room
at
her
simpering
unremorseful
progenitors
our
guide
a
led
us
next
by
circuitous
passages
to
the
most
interesting
corner
of
the
house
the
little
theatre
contrived
with
artless
ingenuity
out
of
what
might
have
been
a
or
one
should
rather
say
the
little
theatres
however
for
the
mistress
of
revels
had
managed
to
crowd
two
stages
into
the
limited
space
at
her
disposal
one
to
the
left
an
actual
with
scenery
for
real
actors
the
other
facing
the
the
more
celebrated
marionette
theatre
raised
a
few
feet
from
the
floor
with
miniature
proscenium
arch
and
curtain
just
such
a
as
wilhelm
meister
described
to
marianne
with
a
prolixity
which
caused
that
amiable
but
flighty
young
woman
to
fall
asleep
between
the
two
stages
about
twenty
spectators
might
have
found
seats
behind
the
front
row
of
hard
wooden
benches
reserved
for
the
châtelaine
and
her
most
distinguished
guests
a
clean
emptiness
now
pervades
this
temple
of
the
arts
an
emptiness
made
actually
pathetic
by
the
presence
on
shelves
at
the
back
of
the
room
of
the
whole
troupe
of
marionettes
brushed
spotless
well
cared
for
and
waiting
only
a
touch
on
their
wires
to
spring
into
life
and
populate
their
little
stage
there
they
stand
in
wistful
rows
the
duenna
the
chimène
the
pantaloon
columbine
and
harlequin
neapolitan
fishers
odalisques
and
peasants
brigands
and
soldiers
of
the
guard
all
carved
with
a
certain
rude
vivacity
and
dressed
ingeniously
and
thriftily
by
the
indefatigable
fingers
which
drove
the
quill
all
night
upstairs
it
brought
one
close
to
that
strange
unfathomable
life
which
only
at
nohant
grows
clear
shows
bottom
as
it
were
closer
still
to
be
told
by
the
that
monsieur
maurice
had
modelled
many
of
his
humorous
on
gens
du
closest
of
all
when
she
added
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
whether
madame
sand
had
really
made
the
little
frocks
herself
oh
yes
i
remember
seeing
her
at
work
on
them
and
helping
her
with
it
i
was
twelve
years
old
when
she
illustration
neuvy
church
of
the
precious
blood
here
then
was
an
actual
bit
of
the
nohant
tradition
before
us
in
robust
and
lively
middle
age
one
of
the
whom
george
sand
loved
and
celebrated
and
who
loved
and
served
her
in
return
for
a
moment
it
brought
nohant
within
touch
yet
the
final
effect
of
the
contact
as
one
reflected
on
the
vanished
enthusiasms
and
ideals
that
george
sand
s
name
revives
was
the
sense
that
the
world
of
beliefs
and
ideas
has
seldom
travelled
so
fast
and
far
as
in
the
years
between
indiana
and
from
la
châtre
just
south
of
nohant
we
turned
due
west
along
the
valley
of
the
creuse
through
a
country
possessing
some
local
fame
for
picturesqueness
but
which
struck
us
in
its
early
spring
nudity
as
somewhat
parched
and
without
sufficient
woodland
to
drape
its
angles
it
makes
up
however
in
architectural
interest
for
what
its
landscape
lacks
and
not
many
miles
beyond
la
châtre
the
otherwise
featureless
little
town
of
presents
one
feature
of
unusual
prominence
this
is
the
ancient
round
church
from
which
the
place
is
named
one
of
those
copies
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
at
jerusalem
with
which
the
returning
crusader
dotted
western
europe
aside
from
their
intrinsic
interest
these
sepulchre
churches
have
gained
importance
from
the
fact
that
but
three
or
four
are
still
extant
the
most
typical
that
of
saint
bénigne
at
dijon
has
been
levelled
to
a
mere
crypt
and
that
of
cambrige
deviates
from
the
type
by
reason
of
its
octagonal
dome
so
that
the
church
of
neuvy
is
of
quite
preëminent
interest
a
late
romanesque
nave
itself
sufficiently
venerable
looking
to
stir
the
imagination
in
its
own
behalf
was
appended
in
the
early
thirteenth
century
to
the
circular
shrine
but
the
latter
still
presents
to
the
dull
old
street
its
unbroken
cylindrical
wall
built
close
on
a
thousand
years
ago
and
surmounted
some
ninety
years
later
by
a
second
story
with
a
romanesque
exterior
arcade
at
this
stage
however
one
is
left
to
conjecture
with
the
aid
of
expert
suggestion
what
manner
of
covering
the
building
was
meant
to
have
the
present
small
dome
perched
on
the
inner
drum
of
the
upper
gallery
is
an
expedient
of
the
most
obvious
sort
and
the
archæologists
have
inferred
that
the
thinness
of
this
drum
may
have
made
a
more
adequate
form
of
roofing
impossible
to
the
idle
at
any
rate
the
interior
of
the
church
is
much
more
suggestive
than
its
bare
outer
shell
we
were
happy
enough
to
enter
it
toward
sunset
when
dusk
had
gathered
under
the
heavy
encircling
columns
and
lights
twinkled
yellow
on
the
central
altar
which
has
so
regrettably
replaced
the
grotto
of
the
it
was
our
added
good
fortune
that
a
small
train
of
the
faithful
headed
by
a
verger
and
a
priest
with
a
benignant
head
were
just
making
a
circuit
of
the
stations
of
the
cross
affixed
to
the
walls
of
the
aisle
and
as
we
stood
withdrawn
while
the
procession
wound
its
way
between
shining
altar
and
shadowy
columns
some
of
the
faces
of
the
peasants
seemed
to
carry
us
as
far
into
the
past
as
the
strange
symbolic
masks
on
the
capitals
above
their
heads
but
what
carries
one
farthest
of
all
is
perhaps
the
fact
well
known
to
modern
archæology
that
the
original
church
built
by
constantine
over
the
of
christ
was
not
a
round
temple
at
all
but
a
vast
basilica
with
apse
the
persians
destroyed
this
building
in
the
seventh
century
and
the
christians
who
undertook
to
restore
it
could
do
no
more
than
round
the
circle
of
the
apse
thus
at
least
covering
over
the
sacred
tomb
in
the
centre
so
swift
was
the
succession
of
demolition
and
reconstruction
in
that
confused
and
clashing
age
so
vague
and
soon
obliterated
were
the
records
of
each
previous
rule
that
when
the
crusaders
came
they
found
no
memory
of
this
earlier
transformation
and
carried
back
with
them
that
model
of
the
round
temple
which
was
henceforth
to
stand
throughout
western
europe
as
the
venerated
image
of
the
primitive
church
of
jerusalem
too
much
lingering
in
this
precious
little
building
brought
twilight
on
us
soon
after
we
joined
the
creuse
at
argenton
and
when
we
left
it
again
at
le
blanc
lights
were
in
the
windows
and
the
rest
of
our
run
to
poitiers
was
a
ghostly
flight
through
a
landscape
with
here
and
there
a
church
tower
looming
in
the
dimness
or
a
heap
of
ruined
walls
rising
mysteriously
above
the
white
bend
of
a
river
we
suffered
a
peculiar
pang
when
a
pile
towering
overhead
told
us
that
we
were
passing
the
great
benedictine
abbey
of
saint
savin
with
its
matchless
lining
of
frescoes
but
a
certain
mental
satiety
urged
us
on
to
poitiers
travellers
accustomed
to
the
marked
silhouette
of
italian
cities
to
their
immediate
proffer
of
the
picturesque
impression
often
find
the
old
french
provincial
towns
lacking
in
physiognomy
each
italian
city
whether
of
the
mountain
or
the
plain
has
an
outline
easily
recognisable
after
individual
details
have
faded
and
it
is
obviously
much
easier
to
keep
separate
one
s
memories
of
siena
and
orvieto
than
of
bourges
and
chartres
perhaps
therefore
the
few
french
towns
with
definite
physiognomies
seem
the
more
definite
from
their
infrequency
and
poitiers
is
foremost
in
this
distinguished
group
illustration
neuvy
interior
of
the
church
not
that
it
offers
the
distinctive
of
such
bold
as
angoulême
or
laon
though
a
in
fact
it
somehow
makes
next
to
nothing
of
this
advantage
and
the
late
freeman
was
justified
in
grumbling
at
the
lack
of
character
in
its
that
character
reveals
itself
in
fact
not
in
any
picturesqueness
of
distant
effect
in
no
such
crown
as
the
towers
of
laon
or
the
domes
of
périgueux
but
in
the
homogeneous
interest
of
the
old
buildings
within
the
city
the
way
they
carry
on
its
packed
romantic
history
like
the
consecutive
pages
of
a
richly
illuminated
chronicle
the
illustration
of
that
history
begins
with
the
strange
little
temple
of
saint
john
a
baptistery
of
the
fourth
century
and
accounted
the
earliest
christian
building
in
france
though
this
applies
only
to
the
lower
story
now
virtually
the
crypt
the
upper
having
been
added
some
three
hundred
years
later
when
baptism
by
aspersion
had
replaced
the
primitive
plunge
unhappily
the
ancient
temple
has
suffered
the
lot
of
the
treasured
relic
and
fenced
about
restored
and
converted
into
a
dry
little
museum
has
lost
all
that
colour
and
pathos
of
extreme
age
that
make
the
charm
of
humbler
monuments
this
charm
in
addition
to
many
others
still
clings
to
the
expressive
west
front
of
notre
dame
la
grande
the
incomparable
little
romanesque
church
holding
the
centre
of
the
built
of
a
dark
grey
stone
which
has
taken
on
and
been
suffered
to
retain
a
bloom
of
golden
lichen
like
the
trace
of
ancient
gilding
it
breaks
at
the
spring
of
its
into
a
profusion
of
serried
overlapping
sculpture
which
rises
tier
by
tier
to
the
splendid
christ
triumphant
of
the
crowning
gable
yet
never
once
crowds
out
and
smothers
the
structural
composition
as
gothic
ornament
in
its
most
exuberant
phase
was
wont
to
do
through
all
its
profusion
of
statuary
and
ornamental
carving
the
front
of
notre
dame
preserves
that
subordination
to
classical
composition
that
marks
the
romanesque
of
southern
france
but
between
the
arches
in
the
great
spandrils
of
the
doorways
up
to
the
typically
poitevin
scales
of
the

arcaded

after
such
completeness
of

as
this
little

no
less
admirable
than
the
more
striking

such
other

has
to
offer

suffer
slightly
by
comparison
saint
hilaire
le
grand
that
notable
church
with
its
triple
aisles
and
its
nave
roofed
by
cupolas
and
the
temple
of
sainte
radegonde
which
dates
from
the
merovingian
queen
from
whom
it
takes
its
name
have
both
suffered
such
repeated
alterations
that
neither
carries
the
imagination
back
with
as
direct
a
flight
as
the
slightly
less
ancient
notre
dame
and
the
cathedral
itself
which
one
somehow
comes
to
last
in
an
enumeration
of
the
poitiers
churches
is
a
singularly
charmless
building
built
in
the
twelfth
century
by
queen
eleanor
of
guyenne
at
the
interesting
moment
of
transition
from
the
round
to
the
pointed
arch
and
completed
later
by
a
gothic
front
it
gropes
after
and
fails
of
its
effect
both
without
and
within
yet
it
has
one
memorable
possession
in
its
almost
alone
of
that
date
in
france
tall
severe
seats
their
backs
formed
by
pointed
arches
with
delicate
carvings
between
the
spandrils
there
is
in
especial
one
small
bat
with
outspread
wings
so
exquisitely
fitted
into
its
allotted
space
and
with
such
delicacy
of
observation
shown
in
the
modelling
of
its
little
face
that
it
remains
in
memory
as
having
the
permanence
of
something
classical
outside
of
dates
and
styles
having
lingered
over
these
things
and
taken
in
by
the
way
an
impression
of
the
confused
and
rambling
ducal
palace
with
its
magnificent
completed
and
adorned
by
jean
de
berry
we
began
to
think
remorsefully
of
the
wonders
we
had
missed
on
our
run
from
le
blanc
to
poitiers
we
could
not
retrace
the
whole
distance
but
at
least
we
could
return
to
the
curious
little
town
of
chauvigny
of
which
we
had
caught
a
tantalising
glimpse
above
a
moonlit
curve
of
the
vienne
illustration
poitiers
the
church
of
we
found
it
by
day
no
less
suggestive
and
full
of
unsuspected
riches
of
its
two
large
romanesque
churches
the
one
in
the
lower
town
beside
the
river
is
notable
without
for
an
extremely
beautiful
arcaded
apse
and
contains
within
a
striking
fresco
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
which
christ
is
represented
followed
by
a
throng
of
the
faithful
kings
bishops
monks
and
clerks
who
help
to
carry
the
cross
the
other
and
larger
church
planted
on
the
summit
of
the
abrupt
escarpment
which
lifts
the
above
the
vienne
has
a
strange
composed
of
no
fewer
than
five
feudal
castles
huddled
so
close
together
on
the
narrow
top
of
the
cliff
that
their
outer
walls
almost
touch
the
lack
in
that
open
country
of
easily
fortified
points
doubtless
drove
the
bishops
of
poitiers
who
were
also
barons
of
chauvigny
into
this
strange
defensive
alliance
with
four
of
their
noble
neighbours
and
one
wonders
how
the
ménage
kept
the
peace
when
local
disturbances
made
it
needful
to
take
to
the
rock
the
gashed
walls
and
dungeons
of
the
rival
ruins
make
an
extraordinarily
romantic
setting
for
the
curious
church
of
saint
pierre
staunchly
seated
on
an
extreme
ledge
of
the
cliff
and
gathering
under
its
flank
the
handful
of
town
within
the
fortified
circuit
there
is
nothing
in
architecture
so
suggestive
of
extreme
age
yet
of
a
kind
of
hale
durability
as
these
romanesque
churches
with
their
prudent
vaulting
their
solid
central
towers
the
close
firm
grouping
of
their
apsidal
chapels
the
renaissance
brought
the
classic
style
into
such
permanent
relationship
to
modern
life
that
architecture
seems
remoter
than
greece
and
rome
yet
its
buildings
have
none
of
the
perilous
frailly
of
the
later
gothic
and
one
associates
the
idea
of
romance
and
ruin
rather
with
the
pointed
arch
than
with
the
round
saint
pierre
is
a
singularly
good
example
of
this
stout
old
school
which
saw
the
last
waves
of
barbarian
invasion
break
at
its
feet
and
seems
likely
to
see
the
ebb
and
flow
of
so
many
other
tides
before
its
stubborn
walls
go
under
it
is
in
their
sculptures
especially
that
these
churches
reach
back
to
a
dim
and
fearful
world
of
which
few
clues
remain
to
us
the
mysterious
baleful
creatures
peopling
their
archivolts
and
capitals
seem
to
have
come
out
of
some
fierce
vision
of
cenobite
temptation
when
the
hermits
of
the
desert
fought
with
the
painted
devils
of
the
tombs
the
apsidal
capitals
of
saint
pierre
are
a
very
menagerie
of
such
strange
demons
evil
beasts
grinning
and
mocking
among
the
stocky
saints
and
angels
who
set
forth
unconcerned
by
such
hideous
propinquity
the
story
of
the
birth
of
christ
the
animals
are
much
more
skilfully
modelled
than
the
angels
and
at
chauvigny
one
slender
monster
with
greyhound
flanks
subhuman
face
and
long
curved
tail
ending
in
a
grasping
human
hand
haunts
the
memory
as
an
embodiment
of
subtle
malevolence
ii
poitiers
to
the
pyrenees
the
road
from
poitiers
to
angoulême
carries
one
through
a
country
rolling
and
various
in
line
a
country
with
a
dash
of
normandy
in
it
but
facing
south
instead
of
west
the
villages
are
fewer
than
in
normandy
and
make
less
mark
in
the
landscape
but
the
way
passes
through
two
drowsy
little
towns
civray
and
ruffec
each
distinguished
by
the
possession
of
an
important
church
of
the
typical
romanesque
of
poitou
that
at
civray
in
particular
is
remarkable
enough
to
form
the
object
of
a
special
pilgrimage
and
to
find
it
precisely
in
one
s
path
seemed
part
of
the
general
brightness
of
the
day
here
again
are
the
sculptured
archivolt
and
the
rich
imagery
of
poitiers
one
strange
mutilated
figure
of
a
headless
horseman
dominating
the
front
from
the
great
arcade
above
the
doorway
as
at
the
church
of
the
sainte
croix
in
bordeaux
but
the
façade
of
civray
is
astonishingly
topped
by
machicolations
which
somehow
in
spite
of
their
later
date
give
it
an
air
of
greater
age
of
reaching
back
to
a
wild
warring
past
angoulême

on
a
promontory
between
charente
and
anguienne
commands
to
the
north
south
and
east
a
vast
circuit
of
meadowy
and
woody
undulations
the
interior
of
the
town
struck
one
as
dull
and
without
characteristic
detail
but
on
the
front
of
the
cathedral
perched
near
the
ledge
of
the
cliff
above
the
anguienne
detail
abounds
as
profusely
as
on
the
façade
of
notre
dame
at
poitiers
it
is
however
so
much
less
subordinate
to
the
general
conception
that
one
remembers
rather
the
garlanding
of
archivolts
the
clustering
of
figures
in
countless
niches
and
arcades
than
the
fundamental
lines
which
should
serve
to
bind
them
together
and
the
interior
roofed
with
cupolas

the
manner
of

stark
and
barren
looking
illustration
angoulême
façade
of
the
cathedral
but
when
one
has
paid
due
tribute
to
the
cathedral
one
is
called
on
from
its
doorway
to
recognize
angoulême
s
other
striking
distinction
its
splendid
natural
site
and
the
way
in
which
art
has
used
and
made
the
most
of
it
starting
from
a
long
leafy
with
private
hôtels
a
great
avenue
curves
about
the
whole
length
of
the
walls
breaking
midway
into
a
terrace
boldly
hung
above
the
valley
and
ending
in
another
leafy
beneath
which
the
slope
of
the
hill
has
been
skilfully
transformed
into
a
public
garden
angoulême
now
thrives
on
the
manufacture
of
paper
and
may
therefore
conceivably
permit
herself
such
civic
adornments
but
how
of
the
many
small
of
france
such
as
laon
or
thiers
for
instance
which
apparently
have
only
their
past
glory
to
subsist
on
yet
manage
to
lead
up
the
admiring
pilgrim
by
way
of
these
sweeping
approaches
encircling
terraces
and
symmetrically
planted
esplanades
one
can
only
salute
once
again
the
invincible
french
passion
for
form
and
fitness
and
conclude
that
towns
as
well
as
nations
somehow
always
manage
to
give
themselves
what
they
regard
as
essential
and
that
happy
is
the
race
to
whom
these
things
are
the
essentials
on
leaving
angoulême
that
afternoon
we
saw
the
first
cypresses
and
the
first
almond
blossoms
we
were
in
the
south
at
last
not
the
hot
delicately
pencilled
mediterranean
south
which
has
always
a
hint
of
the
east
in
it
but
the
temperate
aquitanian
cooled
by
the
gulf
of
gascony
as
one
nears
bordeaux
the
country
grows
less
broken
the
flatter
but
there
is
one
really
noble
impression
when
from
the
bridge
of
saint
andré
de
cubzac
one
looks
out
on
the
lordly
sweep
of
the
dordogne
just
before
it
merges
its
waters
with
the
garonne
to
form
the
great
estuary
of
the
gironde
soon
after
comes
an
endless
dusty
faubourg
then
the
long
stone
bridge
over
the
garonne
and
the
proud
of
bordeaux
a
screen
of
buildings
stretched
along
the
quay
bordeaux
thus
approached
has
indeed
as
the
says
grand
and
again
one
returns
thanks
to
the
motor
which
almost
always
avoiding
the
mean
purlieus
of
the
railway
station
gives
one
these
romantic
or
stately
first
impressions
illustration
thiers
view
of
the
town
from
the
pont
de
seychalles
this
of
bordeaux
is
really
little
more
than
the
architectural
screen
a
street
or
two
deep
of
a
bustling
bright
but
featureless
commercial
town
which
from
the
middle
ages
to
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
seems
to
have
crowded
all
its
history
along
the
curve
of
the
garonne
even
the
early
church
of
the
holy
cross
contemporaneous
with
notre
dame
la
grande
of
poitiers
lifts
its
triple
row
of
romanesque
arcades
but
a
few
yards
from
the
river
and
close
by
is
saint
michel
a
stately
example
of
late
gothic
with
the
unusual
adjunct
of
a
detached
not
set
at
an
angle
in
italian
fashion
but
facing
the
church
squarely
from
a
little
green
enclosure
across
the
street
but
these
vestiges
of
old
bordeaux
in
spite
of
their
intrinsic
interest
are
on
the
whole
less
characteristic
less
personal
than
the
of
its
long
quay
a
row
of
fine
old
hôtels
with
sculptured
pediments
and
stately
doorways
broken
midway
by
the
symmetrical
buildings
of
the
exchange
and
the
custom
house
and
extending
from
the
arch
of
triumph
opposite
the
pont
de
bordeaux
to
the
great
place
des
quinconces
with
its
rostral
columns
and
balustraded
terrace
above
the
river
to
the
modern
traveller
there
is
food
for
thought
in
the
fact
that
bordeaux
owes
this
great
decorative
composition
in
which
should
be
included
the
theatre
unfolding
its
majestic
peristyle
at
the
head
of
the
place
de
la
comédie
to
the
magnificent
taste
and
free
expenditure
of
the
intendant
tourny
who
ruled
the
province
of
guyenne
in
the
eighteenth
century
except
at
such
high
moments
of
æsthetic
sensibility
as
produced
the
monuments
of
greece
and
republican
italy
all
large
schemes
of
civic
adornment
have
been
due
to
the
initiative
of
one
man
and
executed
without
much
regard
to
the
rights
of
the
and
should
the
citizen
of
a
modern
republic
too
rashly
congratulate
himself
on
exemption
from
the
pillage
productive
of
such
results
he
might
with
equal
reason
remark
that
the
tribute
lawfully
extracted
from
him

come
back

gives

given
by
noting
precisely
what

have
survived

the

the

should
be

at

we
began
to
think
differently
when
an
hour

two
later
we
took
the
first
curve
of
the
long
climb
to

bertrand

this
atom
of

a
steep
wedge
of
rock
at
the
mouth
of

once
and
for
many
centuries
a
diocesan
seat
and
who
by
all
the
spirits
of
incongruousness
should
one
of
its
last
bishops
be
but
the
uncle
of
that
acute
and
lively
madame
de

whose
memoirs
have
recently
shed
such
light
on
the
last
days
of
the
old
régime
by
no
effort
of
imagination
can
one
project
into
the
single
perpendicular
street

topped
by
its
rugged
gothic
cathedral

gallant
figure

monseigneur

of
those
philosophical
prelates

one
instinctively
places
against

of

in
truth
the
little
town
has
too

strange
a
history

be

were
driven
back

comes
with
a

surprise
on
the
rich

carefully
tended
interior

a
brilliant
bloom
of
renaissance
decoration
has
overlaid
the
stout
gothic
framework
this
airy
curtain
masking

in
a
of
delicate
yet
hardy
has
kept
in
the
dry

all
its
sharpness
of
detail
acquiring
only
a
lustre
of
surface
that
gives
it
almost
the
texture
of

is
wonderfully
free
and
fanciful
yet
tempered
by
the
southern

form
subdued
to
the

breaking
into

was

the
famous

one

saint
maximin
owes
its
existence
or
that
part
of
it
contingent
on
possessing
so
important
a
church
to
the
ownership
of
the
bones
of
saint
mary
magdalen
whose
supposed
relics
were
formerly
venerated
in
the
great
burgundian
church
of
vézelay
but
in
the
thirteenth
century
were
officially
identified
among
the
treasures
of
the
provençal
town
as
the
penitent
saint
is
supposed
to
have
spent
her
last
years
in
a
grotto
on
the
heights
of
the
sainte
baume
it
seems
more
fitting
that
she
should
now
rest
at
its
foot
than
on
the
rock
of
the
morvan
and
one
is
glad
that
the
belief
was
early
enough
established
to
produce
the
picturesque
anomaly
of
this
fine
fragment
of
northern
art
planted
against
the
classic
slopes
of
the
maritime
alps
the
great
gothic
church
was
never
finished
without
or
within
but
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
renewal
of
devotion
to
saint
mary
magdalen
caused
the
interior
of
the
choir
to
be
clothed
with
a
magnificent
of
in
the
shape
of
recounting
in
their
sculptured

outside

interesting
traces
of

a

its

a

of

juts
from

in

of

one
s
first
feeling
is
that
nothing
else
matches
it
that
no
work
of
man
no
accumulated
appeal
of
history
can
contend
a
moment
against
this
joy
of
the
eye
so
prodigally
poured
out
the
stretch
of
coast
from
toulon
to
saint
tropez
so
much
less
familiar
to
northern
eyes
than
the
more
eastern
portion
of
the
riviera
has
a
peculiar
nobility
a
virgilian
breadth
of
composition
in
marked
contrast
to
the
precipitous
landscape
beyond
looking
out
on
it
from
the
of
costebelle
above
hyères
one
is
beset
by
classic
allusions
analogies
of
the
golden
age
so
divinely
does
the
green
plain
open
to
the
sea
between
mountain
lines
of
such
attic
purity
after
packed
weeks
of
historic
and
archæological
sensation
this
surrender
to
the
spell
of
the
landscape
tempts
one
to
indefinite
idling
it
is
the
season
when
through
the
winter
verdure
of
the
riviera
spring
breaks
with
a
hundred
tender
tints
pale
green
of
crops
white
snow
of
and
fire
of
scarlet
tulips
under
the
grey
smoke
of
from
heights
among
the
the
little
towns
huddled
about
their
feudal
keeps
blink
across
the
at
the
dazzling
indentations
of
the
coast
and
between
the
heights
mild
valleys
widen
down
valleys
with
fields
of
roses
acres
of
budding
vine
meadows
sown
with
narcissus
and
cold
streams
rushing
from
the
chestnut
forests
below
the
bald
grey
peaks
among
the
peaks
are
lonely
hermitages
ruined
remains
of
old
monastic
settlements
carthusian
and
benedictine
but
no
great
names
are
attached
to
these
fallen
shrines
and
the
little
towns
below
have
no
connection
with
the
main
lines
of
history
it
is
all
a
tranquil
backwater
thick
with
local
tradition
little
floating
fragments
of
association
and
legend
but
art
and
history
seem
to
have
held
back
from
it
as
from
some
charmed
elysian
region
too
calm
too
complete
to
be
rudely
touched
to
great
issues
it
was
the
mistral
that
drove
us
from
this
eden
poisoning
it
with
dust
and
glare
and
causing
us
to
take
refuge
north
of
the
alps
there
in
a
blander
air
and
on
a
radiant
morning
we
left
aix
behind
and
followed
the
durance
to
avignon
approaching
the
papal
city
from
the
east
one
may
get
a
memorable
impression
by
following
the
outer
circuit
of
its
walls
to
the
porte
de
l
ouille
which
opens
on
the
place
crillon
just
below
the
great
rock
of
the
palace
seen
thus
from
without
avignon
is
like
a
toy
model
of
a
mediæval
city
and
this
impression
of
artificial
completeness
is
renewed
when
from
the
terrace
below
the
palace
one
looks
out
on
the
rhone
valley
and
its
enclosing
amphitheatre
of
mountains
in
the
light
provençal
air
which
gives
a
finely
pencilled
precision
to
the
remotest
objects
the
landscape
has
an
extraordinarily
topographical
character
an
effect
of
presenting
with
a
insistence
on
detail
its
ruins
its
turreted
bridge
its
little
walled
towns
on
definite
points
of
rock
the
river
winding
through
the
foreground
holds
its
yellow
curve
between
thin
fringes
of
poplar
and
sharp
calcareous
cliffs
and
even
the
remoter
hills
have
the
clear
silhouette
of
the
blue
peaks
in
mediæval
miniatures
the
shoulder
of
the
mont
ventoux
rising
above
them
to
the
north
with
the
firmness
of
an
antique
marble
illustration
toulon
the
house
of
puget
this
southern
keenness
of
edge
gives
even
to
the
gothicism
of
the
church
and
palace
an
exotic
quality
and
makes
the
long
papal
ownership
of
avignon
lasting
it
is
well
to
remember
till
the
general
upheaval
of
a
visible
and
intelligible
fact
though
the
popes
of
avignon
were
frenchmen
avignon
is
unmistakably
almost
inexplicably
italian
its
gothic
vaguely
suggests
that
of
the
ponte
sant
angelo
of
the
fortified
arches
and
tombs
of
mediæval
rome
and
reconciles
itself
as
easily
to
the
florid
façade
of
the
papal
mint
in
the
square
below
as
to
the
delicate
classic
detail
of
the
west
door
of
the
church
rome
but
imperial
not
papal
rome
was
still
in
the
air
as
we
left
avignon
and
followed
the
rhone
valley
northward
to
orange
all
this
part
of
france
is
thick
with
history
and
in
the
ancient
principality
of
orange
the
layers
are
piled
so
deep
that
one
wonders
to
see
so
few
traces
of
successive
dominations
in
the
outward
aspect
of
its
capital
only
the
rome
of
the
emperors
has
left
a
mark
on
the
town
which
lived
with
so
vigorous
and
personal
life
from
the
days
when
it
was
a
gaulish
city
and
a
trading
station
of
massaliote
greeks
and
which
when
it
grew
too
small
for
its
adventurous
brood
sent
rulers
to
both
shores
of
the
north
sea
and
the
fact
that
the
theatre
and
the
arch
survive
while
the
orange
of
carlovingian
bishops
and
mediæval
princes
has
been
quite
wiped
out
and
even
maurice
of
nassau
s
great
fortress
razed
to
the
ground
this
permanence
of
the
imperial
monuments
rising
unshaken
through
the
blown
dust
of
nearly
a
thousand
years
gives
a
tangible
image
of
the
way
in
which
the
roman
spirit
has
persisted
through
the
fluctuations
of
history
to
learn
that
these
very
monuments
have
been
turned
to
base
uses
by
barbarous
the
arch
converted
into
a
fortified
château
de
l
arc
the
theatre
into
an
outwork
of
the
main
fortress
adds
impressiveness
to
their
mutilated
splendour
awing
one
with
the
image
of
a
whole
reconstructed
from
such
fragments
illustration
orange
the
arch
of
marius
among
these
the
theatre
now
quite
stripped
of
ornament
produces
its
effect
only
by
means
of
its
size
and
of
the
beautiful
sweep
of
its
converging
lines
but
the
great
arch
standing
alone
in
a
wide
grassy
square
keeps
on
three
sides
a
corinthian
mask
of
cornice
and
column
and
a
rich
embossing
of
fruit
and
of
sirens
trophies
and
all
this
decoration
is
typically
roman
vigorously
carved
and
somewhat
indiscriminately
applied
one
looks
in
vain
for
the
sensitive
ornament
of
the
arch
of
saint
remy
in
which
mérimée
s
keen
eye
saw
a
germ
of
the
coming
gothic
the
sculpture
of
orange
follows
the
conventional
lines
of
its
day
without
showing
a
hint
of
new
forms
but
that
very
absence
of
imaginative
suggestion
makes
it
roman
and
imperial
to
the
core
ahead
of
us
all
the
way
from
avignon
to
orange
the
mont
ventoux
lifted
into
the
pure
light
its
denuded
flanks
and
wrinkled
summit
but
at
orange
we
turned
about
its
base
and
bore
away
through
a
broken
country
rimmed
with
hills
passing
by
tulette
the
seat
of
a
cluniac
foundation
of
which
the
great
rovere
julius
was
prince
and
prior
and
by

which
under
the
popes
of
avignon
became
the
capital

fortified

suffered
its

fall
in

to
make
room
for
boulevards
as
though
eager
to
efface
all
traces
of
its
long
crowded
past
but
one
such
trace
nearer
at
hand
and
of
more
intimate
connotations
remains
in
the
hôtel

formerly
the
house
of
that
marquis
de

who
married
pauline

the
of
madame
de

this
is
the
first
reminder
that
we
are
in
the
grignan
country
and
that
a
turn
of
the
road
will
presently
bring
us
in
full
view
of
that
castle
where
the
great
of
provence
madame

dispensed
an
almost
royal
hospitably
and
ruled
with
more
than
royal
arrogance

the
comte
de

italy
has
been
in
one

at
every

tulette
it
seems
actually
to
rise
before
one
as
the
great
ruin
springing
suddenly
from
its
cliff
in
the
plain
evokes
a
not
too
audacious
comparison
with
the
rock
of
caprarola
in
france
at
least
there
is
perhaps
nothing
as
suggestive
of
the
fortified
of
italy
as
this
gallant
castle
on
the
summit
of
its
rock
with
the
town
clustering
below
and
the
vast
terrace
before
it
actually
forming
the

long
been
established
on
their
rocky
pedestal

they
built
themselves
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
magnificent
renaissance
façade
of
which
only
the
angle
towers
now
subsist

added

judging
from

to
any
of

a
fine
flight
of
double
steps

descends
to
a
garden
set
with

all
these
recollections
of
which
one
may
read
the
record
in

memoirs
no
doubt
increased
the
fury
of
the
onslaught
which
left
the
palace
of
the

a
blackened
ruin

there
are
few
spots
in

one
more
deeply
resents

of

there
are
few
where
on
second

one
so
distinctly
understands
what

the
of
madame

was
the
most
exorbitant
as
he
was
the
most
distinguished
of
his
race
and
it
was
in
him
that
the
splendour
and
disaster
of
the
family
culminated
but
probably
no
visions
of
future
retribution
disturbed
the
charming

maternal
passion

last
somewhat
melancholy
years

isolation
of

seems
in
that
day
to
have
noticed
the
swarthy
livid
animal
crouched
over
the
soil
which
he
digs
and
turns
with
invincible
obstinacy
but
who
when
he
rises
to
his
feet
a
human
certainly
he
could
not
be
visible
toiling
so
far
below
from
that
proud
terrace
of
the

which
makes
the
church
its
footstool

of
all
would

be
perceptible
to
the

of
the

gaze
when

far
enough
from

even
now

an

in

ridiculing

it
was
an
exile
after

the

haunted
by
the
wistful
figure

extol

reached
her

typical
constructive
detail
and
the
impressionist
is
likely
to
wander
out
soon
to
the
little
square
beyond
the
apse
here
stands
le
pendentif
a
curious
little
vaulted
building
of
the
renaissance
full
of
the
note
of
character
though
its
original
purpose
seems
to
be
the
subject
of
archæological
debate
like
many
buildings
of
this
part
of
the
rhone
valley
it
was
unhappily
constructed
of
a
stone
on
which
the
wear
of
the
weather
might
suggest
the
literal
action
of
the
tooth
of
time
so
scarred
and
gnawed
is
the
whole
charming
fabric
as
to
its
original
use
it
appears
to
have
been
the
mortuary
chapel
of
the
noble
family
whose
arms
are
discernible
among
the
incongruous
animals
of
its
decaying
sculpture
for
it
is
part
of
the
strangeness
of
the
little
monument
that
the
spandrils
of
its
elegant
classic
order
are
inhabited
by
a
rude
romanesque
fauna
which
combined
with
the
dusky
hue
and
ravaged
surface
of
the
stone
confers
on
it
in
contrast
to
the
rejuvenated
church
a
look
of
mysterious
antiquity
a
few
yards
off
down
a
dark
narrow
street
the
same
savour
of
the
past
is
found
in
one
of
those
minor
relics
which
let
the
observer
so
much
deeper
into
institutions
than
the
study
of
their
official
monuments
this
is
simply
an
old
private
house
of
the
early
renaissance
with
a
narrow
sculptured
courtyard
a
twisting
staircase
and
vaulted
stone
passages
and
rooms
of
singularly
robust
construction
it
is
still
appropriately
enough
inhabited
by
très
vieille
who
has
receded
so
deeply
into
the
farthest
convolution
of
her
stout
stone
shell
that
her
friendly
portress
had
leave
to
conduct
us
from
basement
to
attic
giving
us
glimpses
of
dusky
chambers
with
meagre
venerable
furniture
and
of
kitchens
and
offices
with
stone
floors
scoured
coppers
and
pots
of
herbs
all
so
saturated
with
the
old
concentrated
life
of
provincial
france
that
it
was
like
lifting
to
one
s
lips
a
glass
of
some
ancient
wine
just
at
the
of
its
perfection

ages
like
the
temple

a
christian
church
and
now
extricated
lifeless
from
this
fatal
embrace
presents
itself
as
an
impersonal
block
of
masonry
from
which
all
significance
of
detail
is
gone
the
cathedral
too
has
suffered
in
the
same
way
though
from
other
causes
in
its
early
days
it
was
savagely
mutilated
by
the
huguenots
and
since
then
the
weather
eating
deeply
into
its
friable
stone
has
wrought
such
havoc
with
the
finery
and
frippery
of
the
elaborate
west
front
that
the
exterior
attracts
attention
only
as
a
stately
outline
all
the
afternoon
we
had
followed
the
rhone
under
a
cloudy
sky
and
as
we
crossed
the
river
at
vienne
the
clouds
broke
and
we
pushed
northward
through
a
deluge
our
day
had
been
a
long
one
with
its
large
parenthesis
at
grignan
and
the
rainy
twilight
soon
closed
in
on
us
blotting
out
the
last
miles
of
the
approach
to
lyons
but
even
this
disappointment
had
its
compensations
for
in
the
darkness
we
took
a
wrong
turn
coming
out
on
a
high
suburb
of
the
west
bank
with
the
city
outspread
below
in
a
wide
network
of
lights
against
its
holy
hill
of
fourvière
lyons
passes
i
believe
for
the
most
prosaic
of
great
french
towns
but
no
one
can
so
think
of
it
who
descends
on
it
thus
through
the
night
seeing
its
majestic
bridges
link
quay
to
quay
and
the
double
sweep
of
the
river
reflecting
the
million
lights
of
its
banks
it
was
still
raining
when
we
continued
on
our
journey
the
next
day
but
the
clouds
broke
as
we
climbed
the
hill
above
lyons
and
we
had
some
fine
backward
glimpses
of
the
rhone
before
our
road
began
to
traverse
the
dull
plain
of
the
bresse
so
rest
for
ever
rest
o
princely
pair
if
the
lines
have
pursued
one
from
childhood
the
easiest
and
alas
the
most
final
way
of
laying
their
lovely
spectre
is
to
turn
aside
from
the
road
to
dijon
and
seek
out
the
church
of
brou
to
do
so
one
must
journey
for
two
or
three
hours
across
one
of
the
flat
stretches
of
central
france
and
the
first
disillusionment
comes
when
brou
itself
is
found
to
be
no
more
than
a
faubourg
of
the
old
capital
of
the
bresse
the
big
busy
town
of
bourg
sprawling
loosely
among
boundless
pastures
and
detaining
one
only
by
the
graceful
exterior
of
its
somewhat
heterogeneous
church
a
straight
road
runs
thence
through
dusty
outskirts
to
the
shrine
of
margaret
of
austria
and
the
heart
of
the
sentimentalist
sank
as
we
began
to
travel
it
here
indeed
close
to
the
roadside
stood
the
new
pile
looking
as
new
as
it
may
have
when
from
her
white
palfrey
the
widowed
duchess
watched
her
flemish
carvers
lombard
gilders
at
work
looking
in
fact
as
scrubbed
scraped
and
soaped
as
if
its
renovation
were
a
feat
daily
performed
by
the
seven
maids
with
seven
mops
on
whose
purifying
powers
the
walrus
so
ingeniously
speculated
matthew
arnold
s
poem
does
not
prepare
the
reader
for
the
unnatural
gloss
which
makes
the
unhappy
monument
look
like
a
celluloid
toy
perhaps
when
he
saw
it
the
cleansing
process
had
not
begun
but
did
he
ever
really
see
it
and
if
so
where
did
he
see
the
savoy
mountain
meadows
by
the
stream
below
the
pines
and
how
could
he
have
pictured
the
duchess
margaret
as
being
in
the
mountains
while
she
was
supervising
the
work
or
the
alpine
peasants
as
climbing
up
to
pray
at
the
completed
shrine
or
the
priest
ascending
to
it

the

the
walled
town

shall
we
when
we
pass
under
the
traceries
of
the
central
door
and
stand
beneath
the
vaulting
of
the
nave
hear
overhead
the
wind
washing
through
the
mountain

will
have
to
travel
a
long
way

make
itself

lady
mary

maligned
for
her
imaginative
pictures
of
lovere
and
lake
iseo
may
surely
be
forgiven
for
having
gilded
the
lily
for
adding
an
extra
touch
of
romance
where
the
romantic
already
so
abounded
but
it
is
less
easy
to
explain
how
the
poet
of
the
church
of
brou
could
evoke
out
of
the
dusty
plain
of
the
bresse
his
streams
and
mountains
perhaps
the
pilgrim
reflects
the
explanation
will
be
found
within
the
church
and
standing
in
the
magic
light
of
the
vast
western
window
we
too
shall
hear
the
washing

in

understand

this
hope

enter

only
to
discover
that
inside
also
the
archæological
mops
have
been
at
work
and
that
the
elaborate
lining
of
the
shrine
is
as
scoured
and
shiny
as
its
exterior
well
let
us
affront
this
last
disenchantment
and
the
little
additional
one
of
buying
a
ticket
for
the
choir
from
a
custodian
at
a
desk
in
the
nave
and
closing
our
eyes
to
the
secularised
museumised
aspect
of
the
monument
try
to
open
them
to
a
vision
of
what
it
may
have
been
before
it
was
turned
into
a
show
alas
even
this
last
effort
this
of
the
imagination
fails
to
restore
an
atmosphere
of
poetry
to
the
church
of
brou
to
put
it
in
any
other
light
than
that
of
a
kind
of
superlative
albert
memorial
in
which
regardlessness
of
cost
has
frankly
predominated
over
æsthetic
considerations
yet
it
is
manifestly
unfair
to
charge
the
duchess
margaret
with
the
indiscrimination
of
the
one
should
rather
ascribe
to
special
conditions
of
time
and
place
that
stifling
confusion
of
ornament
that
air
of
being
as
bacon
puts
it
so
terribly
daubed
with
cost
which
is
both
the
first
effect
and
the
final
outcome
of
an
inspection
of
brou
if
arnold
gave
the
rein
to
fancy
in
his
he
was
quite
exact
in
picturing
the
conditions
in
which
the
monument
was
produced
and
his
enumeration
of
the
flemish
carvers
lombard
gilders
german
masons
smiths
from
spain
who
collaborated
in
its
making
reminds
one
that
artistic
unity
could
hardly
result
from
so
random
an
association
of
talents
it
was
characteristic
of
the
time
of
the
last
of
the
heterogeneous
gothic
pot
that
this
strange
fellowship
was
not
felt
to
be
any
obstacle
to
the
production
of
a
work
of
art
one
sees
the
same
result
in
almost
all
the
monuments
of
the
period
especially
where
the
influence
has
added
a
last
touch
of
profusion
and
confusion
how
could
an
art
so
evolved
issue
in
anything
but
a
chaos
of
overdone
ornament
how
could
line
survive
in
such
a
deluge
of
detail
the
church
of
brou
is
simply
the
most
distressing
because
the
most
expensive
product
of
the
period
expiring
gothic
changed
its
outline
as
often
as
the
dying
dolphin
is
supposed
to
change
his
colours
every
ornament
suggests
a
convulsion
in
stone
and
on
all
this
extravagance
of
design
which
could
be
real
redeemed
only
by
the
lightest
touch
of
the
chisel
lies
the
heavy
hand
of
the
flemish
sculptor
is
it
possible
that
the
same
phase
of
artistic
feeling
produced
the
three
tombs
of
brou
and
those
of
the
dukes
of
burgundy
at
dijon
certainly
at
least
the
same
hand
did
not
carve
them
at
brou
the
innumerable
subordinate
figures
angels
mourners
and
the
rest
are
turned
out
with
the
unerring
facility
of
the

art
they
represent
the
highest
achievement

sugar
and
white
of

on
the
contrary
each
in

beneath

tomb
of

philip
is
a
living
sentient
creature
a
mourner
whose
grief
finds
individual
utterance
is
there
anything
in
plastic
art
that
more
vividly
expresses
the
passionate
mediæval
brooding
over
death
each
little
cowled
figure
takes
his
grief
his
sense

bent

page
of
a
stoic
one
conjectures
and
so
each
in
his
few
inches
of
marble
and
in
the
confinement
of
his
cramped
little
niche
typifies
a
special
aspect
of
the
sense
of
mortality
above
all
of
its
loneliness
the
way
it
must
be
borne
without
help
the
thought
came
to
one
the
next
day
at
dijon
the
more
vividly
by
contrast
to
the
simpering
sorrow
of
brou
the
tombs
of
the
dukes
of
burgundy
so
cruelly
torn
from
the
hallowed
twilight
of
the
chartreuse
and
exposed
to
the
cold
illumination
of
museum
windows
give
one
even
in
this
impersonal
light
a
strong
sense
of
personality
even
the
overladen
detail
of
the
period
the
aimless
striving
of
its
frets
and
finials
can
not
obscure
the
serious
purity
of
the
central
conception
and
one
is
led
to
the
conclusion
that
a
touch
of
free
artistic
emotion
will
break
through
the
strongest
armour
of
stock
formulas
one
sees
them
of
course
the
ducal
tombs
in
a
setting
in
a
certain
sense
their
own
since
this
privileged
city
in
addition
to
its
other
distinctions
has
a
mediæval
palace
for
its
museum
and
the
mailed
heels
of
the
recumbent
dukes
may
have
rung
on
the
stone
flagging
of
the
salle
des
gardes
where
they
now
lie
but
the
great
vaulted
hall
has
ceased
to
be
a
as
they
have
ceased
to
be
its
lords
and
the
trail
of
label
and
number
of
velvet
cord
and
iron
rail
is
everywhere
in
their
democratised
palace
it
is
noteworthy
therefore
that
as
the
tombs
have
retained
so
much
of
their
commemorative
value
so
the
palace
itself
has
yielded
as
little
as
might
be
of
its
private
character
to
the
encroachments
of
publicity
appearing
almost
as
one
wanders
from
one
bright
room
to
another
like
the
house
of
a
great
collector

still
lives
among

this
felicitous
impression
is
partly
due
to
the
beauty
of

and
partly
also
to
the
fact
that
it
houses
a
number
of
small
collections
the
spoils
of
local

the
impression

which

such
life
to
the
bright

persists
and
deepens
as
one
passes
from
it
into
the
town
the
astonishing
town
which
seems
to
sum
up
in
itself
almost
every
phase
of
french
art
and
history
even
the
deep
soil
of

hardly
another
spot
where
the
past
grows
so
thick
and
so
vigorously

the
ancient
growths
lift
such
hale
heads
to
the
sunlight
the
continuity
of
life
at
dijon
is
as
striking
as
its
diversity
and
its
individuality
old
dijon
is
not
an
archipelago
of
relics
in
a
sea
of
modern
houses
it
is
like
a
vascular
system
binding
the
place
together
in
its
network
of
warm
veins
and
seeming
not
to
be
kept
alive
but
to
be
keeping
life
in
the
city
it
is
to
this
vivid
synthesis
of
the
past
that
one
reverts
from
even
the
strongest
single
impressions
from
the
civic
sumptuousness
of
the
palais
de
justice
the
elegance
of
the
hôtel
de
vogué
the
mysterious
symbolism
of
the
jutting
row
of
gargoyles
on
the
west
front
of
notre
dame
suffering
them
to
merge
themselves
these
and
many
more
into
a
crowded
splendid
tapestry
the
mere
background
of
the
old
city
s
continuous
drama
of
ducal
imperial
parliamentary
life
the
same
impression
of
richness
of
deep
assimilated
experience
accompanies
one
on
the
way
north
through
the
burgundian
province
giving
to
the
trivial
motorist
the
mere
snarer
of
haphazard
impressions
so
annihilating
a
sense
of
his
inability
to
render
even
a
superficial
account
of
what
he
sees
and
beneath
the
thing
that
there
comes
a
moment
when
he
is
tempted
to
take
refuge
in
reporting
the
homely
luxury
of
the
inns
though
even
here
the
abundance
of
matter
becomes
almost
as
difficult
to
deal
with
it
is
for
this
reason
perhaps
that
after
a
morning
among
the
hills
and
valleys
of
the
morvan
in
sight
almost
continuously
of
that
astonishing
burgundian
canal
with
its
long
lines
of
symmetrical
poplars
its
massive
masonry
its
charming
all
repeating
themselves
like
successive
states
of
a
precious
etching
that
after
such
a
morning
i
seek
and
seem
to
find
its
culminating
astonishment
in
the
luncheon
which
crowned
it
in
the
grimy
of
the
at
but
was
it
an
even
and
not
rather
a
this
sandy
public
with
waggoners
and
soldiers
grouped
cheerfully
about
their
vin
while
a
flushed
in
repeated
dashes
from
the
kitchen
laid
before
us
a
succession
of
the
most
sophisticated
dishes
the
tenderest
filet
the
airiest
the
plumpest
artichokes
that
ever
bloomed
on
the
buffet
of
a
parisian
restaurant
it
corresponded
at
any
rate
to
the
kind
of
place
where
in
any
country
one
would
have
found
the
company
as
prohibitory
as
the
food
and
each
equally
a
reason
for
fleeing
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
other
so
it
is
that
may
stand
as
a
modest
symbol
of
the
excessive
amenity
of
this
mellowest
of
french
civilisations
the
more
memorably
to
one
party
of
hungry
travellers
because
it
formed
at
the
same
time
the
final
stage
of
their
pilgrimage
to
vézelay
that
thought
indeed
distracted
us
from
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
filet
and
tore
us
from
the
fragrant
coffee
that
our
panting
waitress
carried
after
us
to
the
motor
s
edge
for
more
than
half
the
short
april
day
was
over
and
we
had
still
two
hours
of
steep
hill
and
vale
between
ourselves
and
vézelay
the
remainder
of
the
way
carried
us
through
a
region
so
romantically
broken
so
studded
with
sturdy
old
villages
perched
on
high
ledges
or
lodged
in
narrow
defiles
that
but
for
the
expectation
before
us
every
mile
of
the
way
would
have
left
an
individual
impression
but
on
the
road
to
vézelay
what
can
one
see
but
vézelay
nothing
certainly
less
challenging
to
the
attention
than
the
loftily
seated
town
of
avallon
which
midway
of
our
journey
caught
and
detained
us
for
a
wondrous
hour
illustration
avallon
general
view
of
the
town
the
strain
of
our
and
the
manifold
charms
of
the
old
town
so
finely
planted
above
the
gorge
of
the
cousin
had
nearly
caused
us
to
defer
vézelay
and
end
our
day
s
journey
at
the
hôtel
du
chapeau
rouge
but
in
the
mild
air
and
on
the
extreme
verge
of
the
bright
sky
there
was
a
threat
of
rain
and
the
longing
to
see
the
great
benedictine
abbey
against
such
a
sunset
as
the
afternoon
promised
was
even
stronger
than
the
spell
of
avallon
we
carried
away
therefore
with
the
fixed
intention
of
returning
only
the
general
impression
of
a
walled
town
set
against
a
striking
background
of
cliff
and
woodland
and
one
small
vivid
vignette
of
a
deserted
square
where
aged
houses
of
incredible
picturesqueness
grouped
themselves
at
scenic
angles
about
the
sculptured
front
of
the
church
of
saint
lazare
from
avallon
to
vézelay
the
road
winds
to
the
west
between
the
leafy
banks
of
the
cousin
through
the
town
of
pontaubert
with
its
ancient
church
of
the
templars
past
the
bridge
of
the
cure
and
out
at
last
into
the
valley
dominated
by
the
conical
hill
of
vézelay
all
day
the
vision
of
the
benedictine
church
had
hung
before
us
beyond
each
bend
of
the
road
and
when
at
length
we
saw
its
mighty
buttresses
and
towers
clenched
in
the
rock
above
the
roofs
and
walls
of
the
abbatial
town
we
felt
the
impact
of
a
great
sensation
for
the
reality
was
nobler
than
the
vision
the
mere
sight
of
vézelay
from
the
valley
quite
apart
from
the
rush
of
associations
it
sets
free
produces
the
immediate
effect
of
one
of
those
perfect
achievements
in
which
art
and
nature
interpret
and
fulfil
each
other
the
church
stands
just
where
such
a
building
should
stand
and
looks
as
a
building
should
look
to
be
worthy
of
such
a
site
the
landscape
about
it
has
the
mingled
serenity
and
ruggedness
which
its
own
lines
express
and
its
outline
grows
out
of
the
without
a
break
between
the
structural
harmony
of
the
two

mounting
up

the

impression
with
the
first
effect
one
is
detained
by
the
village
of
saint
père
pierre
sous
vézelay
which
lies
just
at
the
foot
of
the
road
leading
up
to
the
abbey
here
from
a
heap
of
sordid
houses
and
among
stifling
barnyard
exhalations
rises
the
sweet
worn
old
church
of
saint
pierre
younger
in
date
than
the
abbey
church
above
but
stained
and
seamed
by
time
from
the
stone
embroideries
of
its
triple
porch
and
its
graceful
fantastic
narthex
it
might
pass
at
first
glance
for
a
more
than
usually
temperate
specimen
of
flamboyant
gothic
but
if
one
backs
away
far
enough
to
take
in
its
whole
outline
the
upper
façade
and
the
tower
reveal
themselves
as
an
exquisite
instance
of
transition
the
tower
in
particular
with
its
light
ranges
or
arcades
and
the
slender
trumpeting
angels
that
so
surprisingly
buttress
its
angles
seems
as
an
observant
traveller
has
already
noted
more
italian
than
burgundian
though
to
find
its
match
in
italy
one
would
have
to
seek
not
among
actual
but
in
the
backgrounds
of
early
tuscan
pictures
where
against
a
sky
of
such
heralds
sound
their
call
from
the
thatch
of
the
manger
after
the
mystical
vision
of
the
of
saint
père
it
is
almost
a
drop
back
to
prose
to
climb
the
hill
to
vézelay
and
stand
before
the
church
of
the
magdelen
or
rather
it
is
like
turning
from
the
raptures
of
joachim
of
flora
or
hugo
of
saint
victor
to
the
dialectic
of
saint
thomas
aquinas
this
vast
creation
of
mediæval
faith
might
indeed
be
likened
to
the
great
doctrinal
system
out
of
which
it
grew
such
a
strong
tight
complex
structure
so
studied
balanced
and
mathematically
exact
it
seems
it
has
seen
the
great
church
in
its
thousand
years
of
existence
sights
so
splendid
and
memorable
that
it
seems
at
first
a
mere
background
for
its
memories
for
the
figures
of
saint
bernard
and
becket
of
philip
augustus
and
cœur
de
lion
with
their
interminable
train
of
clerical
and
secular
dignitaries
monks
nobles
doctors
of
the
church
and
all
the
wild
impassioned
rout
of
the
second
and
third
crusades
to
have
seen
so
much
and
now
to
stand
so
far
apart
from
life
one
reflects
on
the
happier
fate
of
those
other
great
churches
of
lay
growth
the
french
cathedrals
whose
hearts
beat
warm
for
so
many
centuries
through
so
many
social
and
political
alternations
the
situation
of
the
church
of
vézelay
typifies
this
deeper
solitude
it
stands
alone
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
divided
from
the
town
below
by
a
wide
stony
square
behind
the
apse
where
the
monastic
buildings
lay
a
shady
grassy
slope
simulates
the
privacy
of
an
english
close
and
on
all
sides
are
the
blue
distances
of
the
morvan
this
loftiness
and
detachment
of
site
give
a
peculiar
majesty
to
the
building
and
conduce
no
doubt
to
the
impression
that
in
all
church
architecture
there
is
nothing
quite
like
it
nothing
in
which
the
passive
strength
of
the
elder
style
so
imperceptibly
blends
with
the
springing
grace
of
the
new
the
latter
meets
one
first
in
the
narthex
a
church
in
itself
which
precedes
the
magnificent
portals
of
the
inner
building
it
is
from
the
threshold
of
this
narthex
that
looking
down
its
lofty
vista
and
through
the
triple
doorways
to
the
vast
and
stern
perspective
of
the
romanesque
nave
one
gets
the
keenest
impression
of
the
way
in
which
in
this
incomparable
building
the
two
styles
have
been
wrought
into
an
accord
that
shows
their
essential
continuity
in
the
nave
itself
with
the
doors
of
the
narthex
closed
another
subtler
impression
awaits
one
for
here
one
seems
to
surprise
the
actual
moment
of
transition
to
see
as
nowhere
else
the
wings
of
the
stirring
under
the
older
forms
more
even
than
its
rich
mysterious
sculptures
far
more
than
its
mere
pride
of
size
and
majesty
does
this
undefinable
of
the
old
static
romanesque
lines
remain
with
one
as
the
specific
note
of
vézelay
giving
it
in
spite
of
its
desertion
in
spite
of
the
dead
and
staring
look
produced
by
indiscriminate
restoration
an
inner
thrill
of
vitality
the
promise
of
strange
futures
beautiful
and
young
such
as
the
greatest
art
alone
possesses
the
long
spring
sunset
filled
the
sky
when
we
turned
from
vézelay
and
began
to
wind
through
the
valley
of
the
cure
to
auxerre
the
day
had
been
too
rich
in
impressions
to
leave
space
for
more
than
a
deep
sense
of
changing
loveliness
as
we
followed
the
curves
of
the
river
through
meadows
by
white
and
villages
hanging
on
the
heights
but
among
these
fugitive
impressions
is
the
vivid
memory
of
a
white
railway
viaduct
so
lightly
yet
securely
flung
across
the
valley
that
in
the
golden
blur
of
sunset
it
suggested
one
of
turner
s
spanning
a
vale
of
tempe
a
notable
instance
of
the
almost
invariable
art
with
which
in
french
engineering
the
arch
is
still
employed
after
that
the
way
grew
indistinct
and
night
had
fallen
when
we
entered
auxerre
feeling
our
way
through
a
dimly
lit
suburb
seeing
the
lights
of
the
town
multiplied
in
the
quiet
waters
of
the
yonne
and
reaching
it
at
last
by
a
bridge
that
led
straight
to
the
steep
central
street
auxerre
the
next
day
even
through
the
blinding
rain
which
so
punctually
confirmed
our
forebodings
revealed
itself
as
one
of
those
individual
old
french
towns
that
are
as
expressive
as
full
of
vivacity
and
character
as
certain
french
faces
finely
massed
above
the
river
in
a
pile
culminating
with
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
and
the
detached
shaft
of
saint
jean
it
confirms
and
indeed
exceeds
on
a
nearer
view
the
promise
of
its
distant
aspect
a
town
which
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
preserve
its
walls
and
one
or
two
of
its
fortified
gates
has
always
and
more
especially
if
seated
on
a
river
the
more
obvious
opportunities
for
picturesqueness
and
at
auxerre
the
narrow
streets
rising
from
the
quay
to
the
central
group
of
buildings
contribute
many
isolated
effects
carved
door
steep
gable
or
opportune
to
the
general
distinction
of
the
scene
the
cathedral
itself
is
the
heart
of
the
charming
old
place
so
rich
in
tone
so
impressive
in
outline
so
profusely
yet
delicately
adorned
it
rose
at
the
end
of
the
long
shedding
on
it
even
through
the
grey
sheets
of
rain
the
warmth
of
its
high
tawny
masses
the
design
of
the
western
front
is
so
full
and
harmonious
that
it
effaces
from
memory
the
less
salient
impression
of
the
interior
under
a
more
favourable
light
which
would
have
brought
out
the
colours
of
the
rich
clerestory
glass
and
the
modelling
of
shafts
and
vaulting
it
would
have
seemed
no
doubt
less
austere
more
familiarly
beautiful
but
veiled
and
darkened
by
it
offered
instead
of
colour
and
detail
only
an
unfolding
of
cavernous
arches
fading
into
the
deep
shades
of
the
sanctuary
the
adjoining
bishop
s
palace
with
its
rugged
romanesque
arcades
planted
on
a
bit
of
city
wall
and
the
interesting
fragment
of
the
church
of
saint
germain
beside
the
hospital
are
among
the
other
notable
monuments
of
auxerre
but
these
too
masked
by
the
incessant
downpour
remained
in
memory
as
mere
vague
masses
of
dripping
masonry
pressed
upon
by
a
low
black
sky
the
rain
pursued
us
northward
from
auxerre
along
the
valley
of
the
yonne
lifting
a
little
toward
noon
to
leave
the
landscape
under
that
blur
through
which
the
french
have
most
persistently
seen
it
joigny
with
this
light
at
its
softest
seemed
even
after
auxerre
one
of
the
most
individual
of
ancient
french
towns
its
long
and
stately
quay
closed
by
a
fine
gate
at
each
end
of
the
town
giving
it
in
especial
a
quite
personal
character
and
one
which
presented
itself
as
a
singularly
happy
solution
of
the
problem
of
linking
a
town
to
its
river
above
the
quay
the
steep
streets
gave
many
glimpses
of
mediæval
picturesqueness
tucked
away
at
almost
inaccessible
angles
but
the
rain
closed
in
on
them
and
drove
us
on
reluctantly
to
sens
here
the
deluge
hung
a
still
denser
curtain
between
us
and
the
amenities
of
this
singularly
charming
town

of
being
like
joigny

river
and

out
with
relative
amplitude
between
roman
ramparts

into
shady
promenades
and
about
midway
of
the
town
at
the
end
of
a
long
like
that
of
auxerre
the
cathedral
rears
itself
in
such
nobility
and
strength
of
line
that
one
instantly
revises
one
s
classification
of
the
great
french
churches
to
make
room
for
this
one
near
the
top
its
beauties
develop
and
multiply
on
a
nearer
view
and
its
kinship
with
canterbury
makes
it
to
those
under
the
spell
of
that
noblest
of
english
choirs
of
peculiar
architectural
interest
but
when
one
has
done
full
justice
to
the
long
unfolding
of
the
nave
to
the
delicate
pallour
of
cousin
s
glass
and
to
the
associations
attached
to
the
altar
of
becket
behind
the
choir
one
returns
finally
to
the
external
composition
of
the
apsidal
chapels
as
the
most
memorable
and
perfect
thing
at
sens
the
development
of
the
which
romanesque
architecture
bequeathed
to
gothic
is
perhaps
the
happiest
product
of
the
latter
growth
on
french
soil
and
after
studying
so
complex
an
example
of
its
possibilities
as
the

whole
system
yet
for
that
very
reason
there
is
perhaps
more
interest
in
a
slow
progress
through
one
of
the
great
industrial
quarters
such
as
must
be
crossed
to
reach
the
country
lying
to
the
northeast
of
paris
to
start
on
a
bright
spring
morning
from
the
place
du
palais
bourbon
and
follow
the
tide
of
traffic
along
the
quays
of
the
left
bank
passing
the
splendid
masses
of
the
louvre
and
notre
dame
the
conciergerie
and
the
sainte
chapelle
to
skirt
the
blossoming
borders
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
and
cross
the
seine
at
the
pont
d
austerlitz
getting
a
long
glimpse
down
its
silver
reaches
till
they
divide
to
envelope
the
cité
and
then
to
enter
by
the
boulevard
diderot
on
the
long
stretch
of
the
avenue
daumesnil
which
leads
straight
to
the
porte
dorée
of
vincennes
to
follow
this
route
at
the
leisurely
pace
necessitated
by
the
dense
flow
of
traffic
is
to
get
a
memorable
idea
of
the
large
way
in
which
paris
deals
with
some
of
her
municipal
problems
the
avenue
daumesnil
in
particular
with
its
interminable
warehouses
and
cheap
shops
and
would
anywhere
else
be
the
prey
of
grime
and
sordidness
instead
it
is
spacious
clean
and
prosaic
only
by
contrast
to
the
elegance
of
the
thoroughfares
preceding
it
and
at
the
porte
dorée
it
gives
one
over
to
the
charming
alleys
of
a
park
as
and
far
more
beautiful
than
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
park
offering
the
luxury
of
its
romantic
lawns
and
lakes
for
the
sole
delectation
of
the
packed
industrial
quarters
that
surround
it
the
woods
of
this
wonderful
bois
de
vincennes
are
real
woods
full
of
and
lilies
of
the
valley
and
as
one
flies
through
them
in
the
freshness
of
the
may
morning
paris
seems
already
far
behind
a
mere
fading
streak
of
on
the
horizon
one
loses
all
thought
of
it
when
beyond
vincennes
the
road
crosses
the
marne
at
thence
it
passes
through
a
succession
of
bright
villages
with
glimpses
here
and
there
of
low
white
châteaux
or
of
little
grey
churches
behind
rows
of
clipped
climbing
at
length
into
an
open
hilly
country
through
which
it
follows
the
windings
of
the
marne
to
meaux
bossuet
s
diocesan
seat
is
a
town
of
somewhat
dull
exterior
with
a
gothic
cathedral
which
has
suffered
cruelly
at
the
hands
of
the
reformers
for
by
an
odd
turn
of
fate
before
becoming
the
eyrie
of
the
eagle
it
was
one
of
the
principal
centres
of
huguenot
activity
an
activity
deplorably
commemorated
in
the
ravaged
exterior
of
the
church
from
meaux
to
rheims
the
country
grows
in
charm
with
a
slightly
english
quality
in
its
rolling
spaces
and
rounded
clumps
of
trees
but
nothing
could
be
more
than
the
villages
than
the
stony
squares
bordered
by
clipped
the
granite
the
churches
with
their
pointed
one
of
these
villages
braisne
stands
out
in
memory
by
virtue
of
its
very
unusual
church
this
tall
narrow
structure
with
its
curious
western
front
so
oddly
buttressed
and
tapering
and
rising
alone
and
fragmentary
among
the
orchards
and
of
a
silent
shrunken
hamlet
is
the
pathetic
survival
of
a
powerful
abbey
once
dominating
its
surroundings
but
now
existing
only
as
the
parish
church
of
the
knot
of
sleepy
houses
about
it
a
stranger
and
less
explicable
vestige
of
the
past
is
found
not
far
off
in
the
curious
walled
village
of
bazoches
which
though
lying
in
the
plain
must
have
been
a
small
feudal
domain
since
it
still
shows
its
stout
mediæval
defences
and
tufted
with
wallflowers
and
wild
shrubs
the
distinguishing
fact
about
bazoches
is
that
it
is
not
a
dwindled
town
with
desert
spaces
between
the
walls
and
a
surviving
nucleus
of
houses
its
girdle
of
stone
fits
as
closely
as
a
and
whatever
were
its
past
glories
they
must
have
been
contained
in
the
same
small
compass
that
suffices
it
beyond
braisne
the
country
is
less
hilly
the
pastures
are
replaced
by
vineyards
and
the
road
runs
across
a
wide
plain
to
rheims
the
extent
of
the
town
and
its
modern
manufacturing
outskirts
make
its
distant
silhouette
less
characteristic
than
that
of
bourges
or
chartres
which
are
still
so
subordinated
to
the
central
mass
of
their
cathedrals
at
rheims
the
cathedral
comes
on
one
unexpectedly
in
the
centre
of
the
town
but
once
seen
it
enters
into
the
imagination
less
startlingly
but
perhaps
more
completely
more
pervasively
than
any
other
of
the
great
gothic
monuments
of
france
this
sense
of
being
possessed
by
it
subdued
to
it
is
perhaps
partly
due
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
simple
tourist
to
the
happy
the
unparalleled
fact
that
the
inn
at
rheims
stands
immediately
opposite
the
cathedral
so
that
admitted
at
once
to
full
communion
with
its
incomparable
west
front
one
returns
after
each
excursion
to
renew
and
deepen
the
relation
to
become
reabsorbed
in
it
without
any
conscious
effort
of
attention
there
are
two
ways
of
feeling
those
arts
such
as
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
which
appeal
first
to
the
eye
the
technical
and
what
must
perhaps
be
called
the
sentimental
way
the
specialist
does
not
recognise
the
validity
of
the
latter
criterion
and
derision
is
always
busy
with
the
uncritical
judgments
of
those
who
have
ventured
to
interpret
in
terms
of
another
art
the
great
plastic
achievements
the
man
in
short
who
measures
the
beauty
of
a
cathedral
not
by
its
structural
detail
consciously
analysed
but
by
its
total
effect
in
indirectly
stimulating
his
sensations
in
setting
up
a
movement
of
associated
ideas
is
classed
and
who
shall
say
unjustly
as
no
better
than
the
reader
who
should
pretend
to
rejoice
in
the
music
of
lycidas
without
understanding
the
meaning
of
its
words
there
is
hardly
a
way
of
controverting
the
axiom
that
thought
and
its
formulation
are
indivisible
or
the
deduction
that
therefore
the
only
critic
capable
of
appreciating
the
beauty
of
a
great
work
of
architecture
is
he
who
can
resolve
it
into
its
component
parts
understand
the
relation
they
bear
to
each
other
and
not
only
reconstruct
them
mentally
but
conceive
of
them
in
a
different
relation
and
visualise
the
total
result
of
such
modifications
assuredly
yet
in
those
arts
that
lie
between
the
bounds
of
thought
and
sense
and
leaning
distinctly
toward
the
latter
is
there
not
room
for
another
a
lesser
yet
legitimate
order
of
appreciation
for
the
kind
of
confused
atavistic
enjoyment
that
is
made
up
of
historical
association
of
a
sense
of
mass
and
harmony
of
the
relation
of
the
building
to
the
sky
above
it
to
the
lights
and
shadows
it
creates
about
it
deeper
than
all
of
a
blind
sense
in
the
blood
of
its
old
racial
power
the
things
it
meant
to
minds
of
which
ours
are
the
and
reconstituted
fragments
such
enjoyment
to
be
of
any
value
even
to
the
mind
that
feels
it
must
be
based
indeed
on
an
approximate
acquaintance
with
the
conditions
producing
the
building
the
structural
theories
that
led
up
to
it
their
meaning
their
evolution
their
relation
to
the
moral
and
mental
growth
of
the
builders
indeed
it
may
be
affirmed
that
this
amount
of
familiarity
with
the
past
is
necessary
to
any
genuine
æsthetic
enjoyment
but
even
this
leaves
the
enjoyment
under
the
slur
of
being
merely
amateurish
and
therefore
in
need
of
a
somewhat
courageous
defence
by
those
who
unequipped
for
technical
verdicts
have
yet
found
a
more
than
transient
satisfaction
in
impressions
of
this
mixed
and
nebulous
order
such
a
defence
is
furnished
to
a
degree
elsewhere
unmatched
by
the
exceptional
closeness
of
intercourse
to
which
propinquity
admits
the
traveller
at
rheims
here
is
the
great
presence
on
one
s
threshold
in
one
s
window
surprised
at
dawn
in
the
mystery
of
its
from
darkness
contemplated
at
in
the
distinctness
of
its
accumulated
detail
its
complex
ritual
of
stone
absorbed
into
the
mind
into
the
heart
again
at
darkness
felt
lastly
and
most
deeply
under
the
midnight
sky
as
a
mystery
of
harmony
and
order
no
less
secret
and
majestic
than
the
curves
of
the
stars
in
their
orbits
such
pleasures
at
any
rate
whatever
their
value
as
contributions
to
special
lines
of
knowledge
enrich
the
æsthetic
consciousness
prepare
it
for
fresh
and
perhaps
more
definite
impressions
enlarge
its
sense
of
the
underlying
relation
between
art
and
life
between
all
the
manifold
and
contradictory
expressions
of
human
energy
and
leave
it
thus
more
prepared
to
defend
its
own
attitude
to
see
how
in
one
sense
a
sense
not
excluding
but
in
a
way
enveloping
and
fertilising
all
the
specialised
forms
of
technical
competence
ist
it
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
this
rich
northeastern
district
that
the
traveller
may
pass
in
a
few
hours
and
through
a
region
full
of
minor
interest
to
another
great
manifestation
of
mediæval
strength
the
fortress
of
coucy
two
such
contrasting
specimens
of
the
vigour
individual
and
collective
of
that
tremendous
age
are
hardly
elsewhere
in
france
to
be
found
in
such
close
neighbourhood
and
it
adds
to
the
interest
of
both
to
know
that
coucy
was
a
fief
of
rheims
bestowed
by
its
archbishop
on
a
knight
who
had
distinguished
himself
in
the
first
crusade
it
was
a
of
this
enguerrand
de
boves
who
built
the
central
keep
and
the
walls
but
the
castle
was
farther
enlarged
and
adorned
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
it
passed
into
the
possession
of
louis
d
orléans
the
brother
of
charles
vi
it
is
doubly
interesting
to
see
coucy
after
carcassonne
because
the
two
fortresses
present
the
opposite
extremes
of
feudal
secular
architecture
carcassonne
being
the
chief
surviving
example
of
a
large
walled
town
with
a
comparatively
small
central
castle
while
at
coucy
the
castle
is
the
predominating
feature
both
in
size
and
site
and
the
town
no
more
than
a
handful
of
houses
within
the
outer
circuit
of
its
defences
both
strongholds
are
of
course
situated
on
steep
heights
and
that
of
coucy
though
it
rises
from
slopes
clad
in
foliage
and
therefore
less
stern
of
outline
than
the
dry
southern
rock
of
carcassonne
stands
no
less
superbly
than
its
rival
in
fact
there
is
perhaps
no
single
point
from
which
carcassonne
produces
quite
such
an
effect
of
concentrated
power
as
the
keep
and
of
coucy
squaring
themselves
on
their
western
ridge
yet
such
comparisons
are
unprofitable
because
the
two
fortresses
were
designed
for
purposes
so
different
and
under
such
different
conditions
that
the
one
is
necessarily
most
vigorous
where
the
other
had
the
least
need
for
a
display
of
strength
coucy
in
its
present
fallen
state
gains
incalculably
from
the
charm
of
its
surroundings
the
lovely
country
enfolding
it
in
woods
and
streams
the
shaded
walks
beneath
its
ramparts
and
above
all
the
distinct
and
exquisite
physiognomy
of
the
tiny
old
town
which
these
ramparts
enclose
the
contrast
between
the
humble
yet
stout
old
stone
houses
ranged
as
it
were
below
the
salt
and
the
castle
throned
on
its
dais
of
rock
at
one
end
of
the
enclosure
seems
to
sum
up
the
whole
social
system
of
the
middle
ages
as
luminously
and
concisely
as
taine
s
famous
category
coucy
has
the
extraordinary
archæological
value
of
a
place
that
has
never
outgrown
the
special
institutions
producing
it
the
hands
of
the
clock
have
stopped
at
the
most
characteristic
moment
of
its
existence
and
so
impressive
even
to
the
unhistorical
mind
is
its
compact
and
vivid
exteriorisation
of
a
great
phase
of
history
that
one
wonders
and
shudders
at
and
finally
almost
comes
to
admire
the
superhuman
stolidity
of
the
successful
merchant
who
has
planted
on
the
same
ledge
as
the
castle
and
almost
parallel
with
its
titanic
towers
a
neatly
turreted
suburban
villa
the
sole
attempt
of
modern
coucy
to
give
the
retort
to
its
overwhelming
past
taking
coucy
as
a
centre
the
traveller
may
within
a
few
hours
extraordinarily
vary
his
impressions
since
the
remarkable
group
of
monuments
distributed
over
the
triangular
bit
of
france
between
paris
rheims
and
saint
quentin
comprises
a
characteristic
example
of
almost
every
architectural
period
from
the
early
middle
ages
till
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
extremes
being
sometimes
in
as
close
touch
as
and
prémontré
turning
first
to
the
west
through
a
country
of
rolling
fields
and
wooded
heights
vaguely
english
in
its
freedom
from
the
devouring
agriculture
of
the
centre
one
comes
on
the
most
english
impression
in
france
the
towers
of
noyon
rising
above
a
girdle
of
orchards
and
meadows
noyon
indeed
to
the
end
maintains
in
one
this
illusion
so
softly
misted
with
verdure
so
lacking
in
the
sharp
edges
of
the
dry
stony
french
town
it
seems
by
its
old
of
and
stucco
by
the
smoothly
turfed
setting
of
the
cathedral
and
the
crowning
surprise
of
a
genuine
close
at
its
back
to
corroborate
at
every
step
the
explorer
s
first
impression
in
the
cathedral
indeed
one
is
no
longer
in
england
though
still
without
being
very
definitely
in
france
for
the
interior
of
noyon
built
at
a
time
when
northern
art
was
still
groping
for
its
specific
expression
is
a
thing
apart
in
cathedral
architecture
one
of
those
fortunate
variations
from
which
in
the
world
of
art
as
of
nature
new
forms
are
sometimes
developed
that
in
this
case
the
variation
remained
sterile
while
it
makes
no
doubt
for
a
more
exclusive
enjoyment
of
noyon
leaves
one
conjecturing
on
the
failure
to
transmit
itself
of
so
original
and
successful
an
experiment
the
deviation
consists
principally
in
the
fact
that
the
transept
ends
of
noyon
are
rounded
so
that
they
form
in
conjunction
with
the
choir
a
kind
of
apsidal
trefoil
of
the
most
studied
and
consummate
grace
the
instinctive
use
of
the
word
perhaps
explains
as
well
as
anything
the
failure
of
noyon
to
repeat
itself
save
once
in
the
south
transept
of
soissons
grace
at
the
expense
of
strength
is
especially
from
without
the
total
result
of
this
unique
blending
of
curves
this
prodigal
repetition
of
an
effect
that
to
produce
its
deepest
impression
should
be
used
singly
and
only
as
the
culmination
the
ecstatic
flowering
of
a
vigorous
assemblage
of
straight
lines
but
within
the
church
and
especially
from
the
point
where
the
sweep
of
both
transepts
may
be
seen
flowing
into
the
curves
of
the
choir
one
is
too
deeply
penetrated
by
the
grace
to
feel
in
it
any
latent
weakness
for
pure
loveliness
of
line
nothing
in
northern
church
architecture
not
even
the
long
bold
sweep
of
canterbury
choir
surpasses
the
complex
pattern
of
the
east
end
of
noyon
and
in
the
detail
of
the
interior
construction
the
free
almost
careless
mingling
of
the
round
and
the
pointed
arch
heightens
the
effect
of
noyon
as
of
something
experimental
fugitive
not
to
come
again
the
blue
flower
as
it
were
of
the
gothic
garden
an
experiment
which
seems
to
express
the
fantasy
of
a
single
mind
rather
than
such
collective
endeavour
as
brought
forth
the
great
secular
churches
of
the
middle
ages
while
noyon
offers
in
its
general
setting
and
in
certain
architectural
peculiarities
suggestions
so
specifically
english
the
type
of
its
chief
civic
monument
seems
drawn
from
that
burgundian
region
where
the
passing
of
gothic
into
renaissance
forms
found
so
rich
and
picturesque
an
expression
the
hôtel
de
ville
of
noyon
built
in
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
is
a
charming
product
of
that
transitional
moment
which
was
at
its
best
in
the
treatment
of
municipal
buildings
since
domestic
architecture
was
still
cramped
and
driven
to
an
overcrowding
of
detail
by
the
lingering
habit
of
construction
in
the
creation
of
the
the
new
art
could
throw
off
feudal
restraints
and
the
architect
of
the
graceful
ornate
yet
sober
building
at
noyon
with
its
two
façades
so
equally
composed
as
wholes
so
lingered
over
and
caressed
in
every
part
has
united
all
the
freedom
of
the
new
spirit
with
the
patient
care
for
detail
that
marked
the
old
illustration
noyon

to
the
northwest

one
s

impression
on
entering
this

is
of
coming
into
a
where
all
the
habitués
have
taken
the
same
tone
where
the
angles
of
difference
have
been
so
rubbed
down
that
personalities
are
as
hard
to
differentiate
as
in

which
unites

trait
is
found
in
the
fixed
smile
on
the
lips
of
all
the
sitters
it
is
curious
and
a
little
disconcerting
on
first
entering
to
see
faces
of
such
marked
individuality
from
the
rough
unshorn
vernezobre
to
the
mincing
camargo
overrun
by
the

simper
of

disconcerting

only
by
eliminating
the

see
the
other
features
without
it
can
one
do
justice
to
the
vigorous
and
penetrating
portraiture
of
latour
then
indeed
the
pictures
affirm
themselves
as
documents
and
the
artist
s
technical
skill
in
varying
his
methods
with
the
type
of
his
sitters
becomes
only
less
interesting
than
the
psychological
insight
of
which
after
all
it
is
a
partial
expression
one
s
attention
is
at
first
absorbed
by
the
high
personal
interest
of
the

when
this
has
been
allowed
for
the
general
conclusion
resulting
from
their
collective
study
is
that
even
in
that
day
of
feminine
ascendancy
the
man
s
face
not
only
plastically
but
psychologically
was
a
far
finer
subject
than
the

had
before
his

of

the

vast
a
sum

dull
unrewarded

have
on

but
in
a
different
and
a
milder
strain
the
short
run
from
laon
to
soissons
through
a
gently
undulating
landscape
prepares
one
for
these
softer
impressions
the
city
has
neither
the
proud
site
nor
the
defensive
outline
of
laon
it
lies
in
the
valley
of
the
aisne
in
a
circle
of
wooded
hills
with
the
river

peaceably
between
the
old
town
and
its
faubourg

through

faubourg

is
caught
in
a
maze
of
narrow
streets

lead
up
tortuously
to
the
cathedral

the
pressure
of
surrounding
houses
makes
it
difficult
to
get
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
church
but
one
receives
in
narrow
glimpses
through
the
clipped
limes
of
the
a
general
impression
of
grace
and
sobriety
that
somehow
precludes
any
strong
individual
effect
the
cathedral
of
soissons
is
indeed
chiefly
remarkable
for
its
repetition
of
the
rounded
transepts
of
noyon
though
in
this
case
for
reasons
which
it
would
be
interesting
to
learn
the
round
end
while
receiving
the
farther
development
of
an
aisle

triforium
has
been
applied
only
to
one
transept
the
thought
of
soissons
however
at
least
in
the
mind
of
the
passing
impressionist
must
remain
chiefly
associated
with
that
rarest
creation
of
the
late
gothic
of
the
the
façade
of
saint
jean
des
vignes
this
church
which
formed
part
of
a
monastic
settlement

now
almost
in

of
the

buildings

remain

admirable

house

much
later
date

complete

the
outline
of
the
beautiful

front

one
would
hardly
guess
the
ruin
of
the
nave
but
for
the
blue
sky
showing
through
the
vast
circle
of
the
central
rose
from
which
every
fragment
of
tracery
has
been
stripped
yet
one
can
pardon
even
that
inhumanity
to
the
destroyers
who
respected
the
towers
those
incomparable
towers
so
harmonious
in
their
divergences
so
typical

vertical
buttressing

at
the
level
of
the
upper
gable
into

masses
of
differing
height
and
breadth

more
boldly
tapering
the
other

massive
and

preserving

a

essential
features

horizontal
lines

unity
that
dominates
their
differences

for

is
only
a
small
sleepy
town
with
two
or
three
churches
of
minor
interest
with
that
the
might
dismiss
it
but
had
there
been
anything
in
all
our
wanderings
quite
comparable
to
the
impression
produced
by
that
little
cathedral
in
its
quiet
square
a
monument
so
compact
yet
noble
so
embroidered
with
delicate
detail
above
all
so
with
a
wonderful
golden
lichen
that
it
seems
like
a
dim
old
from
which

is

worn

converted
into

has
sunk
to
the
uses
of

storage
warehouse
in

case
access
to
the
interior
is
sometimes
hard
to
obtain
but
the
two
façades
one
so
delicate
in
its
early
gothic
reticence
the
other
so
prodigal
of
the
last
graces
of
the
style
carry
on
almost
unbrokenly
the
architectural
chronicle
which
begins
with
the
romanesque
cathedral
and
the
neglect
so
painful
to
witness
in
the
interior
has
given
them
a
almost
rich
enough
to
atone
for
the
cost
at
which
it
has
been
acquired
if
on
leaving
senlis
one
turns
westward
skirting
the
wooded
glades
of
chantilly
and
crossing
the
park
at
the
foot
of
the
canal
de
la
manche
one
comes
presently
into
the
valley
of
the
oise
and
a
few
kilomètres
farther
on
the
village
of

leu
d

lifts
its
terraced
church
above
the
river
the
site
of

leu
is
that
of
the
little
peaked
mediterranean
towns
there
is
something
defensive
defiant
in
the
way
it
grasps
its
and
lifts
its
church
up
like
a
shield
the
town
owes
this
crowning
ornament
and
doubtless
also
its
own
slender
existence
to
the
founding
here
in
the
eleventh
century
of
a
great
cluniac
abbey
of
which
certain
romanesque
arcades
and
a
fortified
gate
may
be
traced
among
the
débris
behind
the
apse
of
the
original
church
there
survives
only
a
tower
to
which
in
the
latter
half
of
the
twelfth
century
was
added
what
is
perhaps
the
most
homogeneous
and
assuredly
the
most
beautiful
early
gothic
structure
in
france
the
peculiar
interest
of
this
church
of
saint
leu
apart
from
its
intrinsic
nobility
of
design
lies
in
the
fact
of
its
being
so
curiously
the
counterpart
the
other
side
of
the
shield
of
the
church
of
vézelay
for
as
at
vézelay
one
felt
beneath
the
weight
of
the
round
openings
the
impatient
stirrings
of
the
pointed
arch
so
here
at
saint
leu
where
the
latter
form
at
last
triumphs
its
soaring
movement
is
still
held
down
by
the
romanesque
frame
of
the
church
it
is
hard
to
define
the
cause
of
this
impression
since
at
saint
leu
the
pointed
style
has
quite
freed
itself
structurally
from
romanesque
all
the
chief
elements
of
later
gothic
construction
being
blent
there
in
so
harmonious
a
composition
that
as
charles
moore
has
pointed
out
the
church
might
stand
for
a
perfect
example
of
unadorned
all
that
later
art
could
do
toward
the
elaboration
of
such
a
style
was
to
add
ornament
enlarge
openings
and
lighten
the
masses
but
by
the
doing
of
just
that
the
immense
static
value
of
the
earlier
proportions
was
lost
and
the
distinction
of
saint
leu
is
that
it
blends
in
perfect
measure
gothic
lightness
with
romanesque
tenacity
of
this
the
inside
of
the
church
is
no
less
illustrative
than
its
exterior
though
the
western
bays
of
the
nave
were
built
later
than
its
eastern
portion
they
end
in
a
narthex
on
the
lines
of
the
outer
porch
of
