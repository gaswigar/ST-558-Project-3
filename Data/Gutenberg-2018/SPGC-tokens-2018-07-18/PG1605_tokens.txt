in
the
centre
of
the
pine
wood
called
coilla
doraca
there
lived
not
long
ago
two
philosophers
they
were
wiser
than
anything
else
in
the
world
except
the
salmon
who
lies
in
the
pool
of
glyn
cagny
into
which
the
nuts
of
knowledge
fall
from
the
hazel
bush
on
its
bank
he
of
course
is
the
most
profound
of
living
creatures
but
the
two
philosophers
are
next
to
him
in
wisdom
their
faces
looked
as
though
they
were
made
of
parchment
there
was
ink
under
their
nails
and
every
difficulty
that
was
submitted
to
them
even
by
women
they
were
able
to
instantly
resolve
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
and
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
asked
them
the
three
questions
which
nobody
had
ever
been
able
to
answer
and
they
were
able
to
answer
them
that
was
how
they
obtained
the
enmity
of
these
two
women
which
is
more
valuable
than
the
friendship
of
angels
the
grey
woman
and
the
thin
woman
were
so
incensed
at
being
answered
that
they
married
the
two
philosophers
in
order
to
be
able
to
pinch
them
in
bed
but
the
skins
of
the
philosophers
were
so
thick
that
they
did
not
know
they
were
being
pinched
they
repaid
the
fury
of
the
women
with
such
tender
affection
that
these
vicious
creatures
almost
expired
of
chagrin
and
once
in
a
very
ecstacy
of
exasperation
after
having
been
kissed
by
their
husbands
they
uttered
the
fourteen
hundred
maledictions
which
comprised
their
wisdom
and
these
were
learned
by
the
philosophers
who
thus
became
even
wiser
than
before
in
due
process
of
time
two
children
were
born
of
these
marriages
they
were
born
on
the
same
day
and
in
the
same
hour
and
they
were
only
different
in
this
that
one
of
them
was
a
boy
and
the
other
one
was
a
girl
nobody
was
able
to
tell
how
this
had
happened
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
philosophers
were
forced
to
admire
an
event
which
they
had
been
unable
to
prognosticate
but
having
proved
by
many
different
methods
that
the
children
were
really
children
that
what
must
be
must
be
that
a
fact
can
not
be
controverted
and
that
what
has
happened
once
may
happen
twice
they
described
the
occurrence
as
extraordinary
but
not
unnatural
and
submitted
peacefully
to
a
providence
even
wiser
than
they
were
the
philosopher
who
had
the
boy
was
very
pleased
because
he
said
there
were
too
many
women
in
the
world
and
the
philosopher
who
had
the
girl
was
very
pleased
also
because
he
said
you
can
not
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
the
grey
woman
and
the
thin
woman
however
were
not
in
the
least
softened
by
said
that
they
had
not
bargained
for
it
that
the
children
were
gotten
under
false
presences
that
they
were
respectable
married
women
and
that
as
a
protest
against
their
wrongs
they
would
not
cook
any
more
food
for
the
philosophers
this
was
pleasant
news
for
their
husbands
who
disliked
the
women
s
cooking
very
much
but
they
did
not
say
so
for
the
women
would
certainly
have
insisted
on
their
rights
to
cook
had
they
imagined
their
husbands
disliked
the
results
therefore
the
philosophers
besought
their
wives
every
day
to
cook
one
of
their
lovely
dinners
again
and
this
the
women
always
refused
to
do
they
all
lived
together
in
a
small
house
in
the
very
centre
of
a
dark
pine
wood
into
this
place
the
sun
never
shone
because
the
shade
was
too
deep
and
no
wind
ever
came
there
either
because
the
boughs
were
too
thick
so
that
it
was
the
most
solitary
and
quiet
place
in
the
world
and
the
philosophers
were
able
to
hear
each
other
thinking
all
day
long
or
making
speeches
to
each
other
and
these
were
the
pleasantest
sounds
they
knew
of
to
them
there
were
only
two
kinds
of
sounds
anywhere
these
were
conversation
and
noise
they
liked
the
first
very
much
indeed
but
they
spoke
of
the
second
with
stern
disapproval
and
even
when
it
was
made
by
a
bird
a
breeze
or
a
shower
of
rain
they
grew
angry
and
demanded
that
it
should
be
abolished
their
wives
seldom
spoke
at
all
and
yet
they
were
never
silent
they
communicated
with
each
other
by
a
kind
of
physical
telegraphy
which
they
had
learned
among
the
cracked
their
quickly
or
slowly
and
so
were
able
to
communicate
with
each
other
over
immense
distances
for
by
dint
of
long
practice
they
could
make
great
explosive
sounds
which
were
nearly
like
thunder
and
gentler
sounds
like
the
tapping
of
grey
ashes
on
a
hearthstone
the
thin
woman
hated
her
own
child
but
she
loved
the
grey
woman
s
baby
and
the
grey
woman
loved
the
thin
woman
s
infant
but
could
not
abide
her
own
a
compromise
may
put
an
end
to
the
most
perplexing
of
situations
and
consequently
the
two
women
swapped
children
and
at
once
became
the
most
tender
and
amiable
mothers
imaginable
and
the
families
were
able
to
live
together
in
a
more
perfect
amity
than
could
be
found
anywhere
else
the
children
grew
in
grace
and
comeliness
at
first
the
little
boy
was
short
and
fat
and
the
little
girl
was
long
and
thin
then
the
little
girl
became
round
and
chubby
while
the
little
boy
grew
lanky
and
wiry
this
was
because
the
little
girl
used
to
sit
very
quiet
and
be
good
and
the
little
boy
used
not
they
lived
for
many
years
in
the
deep
seclusion
of
the
pine
wood
wherein
a
perpetual
twilight
reigned
and
here
they
were
wont
to
play
their
childish
games
flitting
among
the
shadowy
trees
like
little
quick
shadows
at
times
their
mothers
the
grey
woman
and
the
thin
woman
played
with
them
but
this
was
seldom
and
sometimes
their
fathers
the
two
philosophers
came
out
and
looked
at
them
through
spectacles
which
were
very
round
and
very
glassy
and
had
immense
circles
of
horn
all
round
the
edges
they
had
however
other
playmates
with
whom
they
could
romp
all
day
long
there
were
hundreds
of
rabbits
running
about
in
the
brushwood
they
were
full
of
fun
and
were
very
fond
of
playing
with
the
children
there
were
squirrels
who
joined
cheerfully
in
their
games
and
some
goats
having
one
day
strayed
in
from
the
big
world
were
made
so
welcome
that
they
always
came
again
whenever
they
got
the
chance
there
were
birds
also
crows
and
blackbirds
and
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
youngsters
and
visited
them
as
frequently
as
their
busy
lives
permitted
at
a
short
distance
from
their
home
there
was
a
clearing
in
the
wood
about
ten
feet
square
through
this
clearing
as
through
a
funnel
the
sun
for
a
few
hours
in
the
summer
time
blazed
down
it
was
the
boy
who
first
discovered
the
strange
radiant
shaft
in
the
wood
one
day
he
had
been
sent
out
to
collect
pine
cones
for
the
fire
as
these
were
gathered
daily
the
supply
immediately
near
the
house
was
scanty
therefore
he
had
while
searching
for
more
wandered
further
from
his
home
than
usual
the
first
sight
of
the
extraordinary
blaze
astonished
him
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
and
the
steady
unwinking
glare
aroused
his
fear
and
curiosity
equally
curiosity
will
conquer
fear
even
more
than
bravery
will
indeed
it
has
led
many
people
into
dangers
which
mere
physical
courage
would
shudder
away
from
for
hunger
and
love
and
curiosity
are
the
great
impelling
forces
of
life
when
the
little
boy
found
that
the
light
did
not
move
he
drew
closer
to
it
and
at
last
emboldened
by
curiosity
he
stepped
right
into
it
and
found
that
it
was
not
a
thing
at
all
the
instant
that
he
stepped
into
the
light
he
found
it
was
hot
and
this
so
frightened
him
that
he
jumped
out
of
it
again
and
ran
behind
a
tree
then
he
jumped
into
it
for
a
moment
and
out
of
it
again
and
for
nearly
half
an
hour
he
played
a
splendid
game
of
tip
and
tig
with
the
sunlight
at
last
he
grew
quite
bold
and
stood
in
it
and
found
that
it
did
not
burn
him
at
all
but
he
did
not
like
to
remain
in
it
fearing
that
he
might
be
cooked
when
he
went
home
with
the
pine
cones
he
said
nothing
to
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
or
to
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
or
to
the
two
philosophers
but
he
told
the
little
girl
all
about
it
when
they
went
to
bed
and
every
day
afterwards
they
used
to
go
and
play
with
the
sunlight
and
the
rabbits
and
the
squirrels
would
follow
them
there
and
join
in
their
games
with
twice
the
interest
they
had
shown
before
chapter
ii
to
the
lonely
house
in
the
pine
wood
people
sometimes
came
for
advice
on
subjects
too
recondite
for
even
those
extremes
of
elucidation
the
parish
priest
and
the
tavern
these
people
were
always
well
received
and
their
perplexities
were
attended
to
instantly
for
the
philosophers
liked
being
wise
and
they
were
not
ashamed
to
put
their
learning
to
the
proof
nor
were
they
as
so
many
wise
people
are
fearful
lest
they
should
become
poor
or
less
respected
by
giving
away
their
knowledge
these
were
favourite
maxims
with
them
you
must
be
fit
to
give
before
you
can
be
fit
to
receive
knowledge
becomes
lumber
in
a
week
therefore
get
rid
of
it
the
box
must
be
emptied
before
it
can
be
refilled
refilling
is
progress
a
sword
a
spade
and
a
thought
should
never
be
allowed
to
rust
the
grey
woman
and
the
thin
woman
however
held
opinions
quite
contrary
to
these
and
their
maxims
also
were
different
a
secret
is
a
weapon
and
a
friend
man
is
god
s
secret
power
is
man
s
secret
sex
is

secret
by
having
much
you
are
fitted
to
have
more
there
is
always
room
in

box
the
art
of
packing
is
the
last
lecture
of
wisdom
the
scalp
of
your
enemy
is
progress
holding
these
opposed
views
it
seemed
likely
that
visitors
seeking
for
advice
from
the
philosophers
might
be
astonished
and
captured
by
their
wives
but
the
women
were
true
to
their
own
doctrines
and
refused
to
part
with
information
to
any
persons
saving
only
those
of
high
rank
such
as
policemen
gombeen
men
and
district
and
county
councillors
but
even
to
these
they
charged
high
prices
for
their
information
and
a
bonus
on
any
gains
which
accrued
through
the
following
of
their
advices
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
that
their
following
was
small
when
compared
with
those
who
sought
the
assistance
of
their
husbands
for
scarcely
a
week
passed
but
some
person
came
through
the
pine
wood
with
his
brows
in
a
tangle
of
perplexity
in
these
people
the
children
were
deeply
interested
they
used
to
go
apart
afterwards
and
talk
about
them
and
would
try
to
remember
what
they
looked
like
how
they
talked
and
their
manner
of
walking
or
taking
snuff
after
a
time
they
became
interested
in
the
problems
which
these
people
submitted
to
their
parents
and
the
replies
or
instructions
wherewith
the
latter
relieved
them
long
training
had
made
the
children
able
to
sit
perfectly
quiet
so
that
when
the
talk
came
to
the
interesting
part
they
were
entirely
forgotten
and
ideas
which
might
otherwise
have
been
spared
their
youth
became
the
commonplaces
of
their
conversation
when
the
children
were
ten
years
of
age
one
of
the
philosophers
died
he
called
the
household
together
and
announced
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
bid
them
all
and
that
his
intention
was
to
die
as
quickly
as
might
be
it
was
he
continued
an
unfortunate
thing
that
his
health
was
at
the
moment
more
robust
than
it
had
been
for
a
long
time
but
that
of
course
was
no
obstacle
to
his
resolution
for
death
did
not
depend
upon
but
upon
a
multitude
of
other
factors
with
the
details
whereof
he
would
not
trouble
them
his
wife
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
applauded
this
resolution
and
added
as
an
amendment
that
it
was
high
time
he
did
something
that
the
life
he
had
been
leading
was
an
arid
and
unprofitable
one
that
he
had
stolen
her
fourteen
hundred
maledictions
for
which
he
had
no
use
and
presented
her
with
a
child
for
which
she
had
none
and
that
all
things
concerned
the
sooner
he
did
die
and
stop
talking
the
sooner
everybody
concerned
would
be
made
happy
the
other
philosopher
replied
mildly
as
he
lit
his
pipe
brother
the
greatest
of
all
virtues
is
curiosity
and
the
end
of
all
desire
is
wisdom
tell
us
therefore
by
what
steps
you
have
arrived
at
this
commendable
to
this
the
philosopher
replied
i
have
attained
to
all
the
wisdom
which
i
am
fitted
to
bear
in
the
space
of
one
week
no
new
truth
has
come
to
me
all
that
i
have
read
lately
i
knew
before
all
that
i
have
thought
has
been
but
a
recapitulation
of
old
and
wearisome
ideas
there
is
no
longer
an
horizon
before
my
eves
space
has
narrowed
to
the
petty
dimensions
of
my
thumb
time
is
the
tick
of
a
clock
good
and
evil
are
two
peas
in
the
one
pod
my
wife
s
face
is
the
same
for
ever
i
want
to
play
with
the
children
and
yet
i
do
not
want
to
your
conversation
with
me
brother
is
like
the
droning
of
a
bee
in
a
dark
cell
the
pine
trees
take
root
and
grow
and
it
s
all
bosh
his
friend
replied
brother
these
are
weighty
reflections
and
i
do
clearly
perceive
that
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
stop
i
might
observe
not
in
order
to
combat
your
views
but
merely
to
continue
an
interesting
conversation
that
there
are
still
some
knowledges
which
you
have
not
assimilated
you
do
not
yet
know
how
to
play
the
tambourine
nor
how
to
be
nice
to
your
wife
nor
how
to
get
up
first
in
the
morning
and
cook
the
breakfast
have
you
learned
how
to
smoke
strong
tobacco
as
i
do
or
can
you
dance
in
the
moonlight
with
a
woman
of
the
shee
to
understand
the
theory
which
underlies
all
things
is
not
sufficient
it
has
occurred
to
me
brother
that
wisdom
may
not
be
the
end
of
everything
goodness
and
kindliness
are
perhaps
beyond
wisdom
is
it
not
possible
that
the
ultimate
end
is
gaiety
and
music
and
a
dance
of
joy
wisdom
is
the
oldest
of
all
things
wisdom
is
all
head
and
no
heart
behold
brother
you
are
being
crushed
under
the
weight
of
your
head
you
are
dying
of
old
age
while
you
are
yet
a
brother
replied
the
other
philosopher
your
voice
is
like
the
droning
of
a
bee
in
a
dark
cell
if
in
my
latter
days
i
am
reduced
to
playing
on
the
tambourine
and
running
after
a
hag
in
the
moonlight
and
cooking
your
breakfast
in
the
grey
morning
then
it
is
indeed
time
that
i
should
die
so
saying
the
philosopher
arose
and
removed
all
the
furniture
to
the
sides
of
the
room
so
that
there
was
a
clear
space
left
in
the
centre
he
then
took
off
his
boots
and
his
coat
and
standing
on
his
toes
he
commenced
to
gyrate
with
extraordinary
rapidity
in
a
few
moments
his
movements
became
steady
and
swift
and
a
sound
came
from
him
like
the
humming
of
a
swift
saw
this
sound
grew
deeper
and
deeper
and
at
last
continuous
so
that
the
room
was
filled
with
a
thrilling
noise
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
movement
began
to
noticeably
slacken
in
another
three
minutes
it
was
quite
slow
in
two
more
minutes
he
grew
visible
again
as
a
body
and
then
he
wobbled
to
and
fro
and
at
last
dropped
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
he
was
quite
dead
and
on
his
face
was
an
expression
of
serene
beatitude
god
be
with
you
brother
said
the
remaining
philosopher
and
he
lit
his
pipe
focused
his
vision
on
the
extreme
tip
of
his
nose
and
began
to
meditate
profoundly
on
the
aphorism
whether
the
good
is
the
all
or
the
all
is
the
good
in
another
moment
he
would
have
become
oblivious
of
the
room
the
company
and
the
corpse
but
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
shattered
his
meditation
by
a
demand
for
advice
as
to
what
should
next
be
done
the
philosopher
with
an
effort
detached
his
eyes
from
his
nose
and
his
mind
from
his
maxim
chaos
said
he
is
the
first
condition
order
is
the
first
law
continuity
is
the
first
reflection
quietude
is
the
first
happiness
our
brother
is
dead
bury
so
saying
he
returned
his
eyes
to
his
nose
and
his
mind
to
his
maxim
and
lapsed
to
a
profound
reflection
wherein
nothing
sat
perched
on
insubstantiality
and
the
spirit
of
artifice
goggled
at
the
puzzle
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
her
box
and
raised
the
keen
over
her
husband
you
were
my
husband
and
you
are
dead
it
is
wisdom
that
has
killed
you
if
you
had
listened
to
my
wisdom
instead
of
to
your
own
you
would
still
be
a
trouble
to
me
and
i
would
still
be
happy
women
are
stronger
than
men
they
do
not
die
of
wisdom
they
are
better
than
men
because
they
do
not
seek
wisdom
they
are
wiser
than
men
because
they
know
less
and
understand
more
i
had
fourteen
hundred
maledictions
my
little
store
and
by
a
trick
you
stole
them
and
left
me
empty
you
stole
my
wisdom
and
it
has
broken
your
neck
i
lost
my
knowledge
and
i
am
yet
alive
raising
the
keen
over
your
body
but
it
was
too
heavy
for
you
my
little
knowledge
you
will
never
go
out
into
the
pine
wood
in
the
morning
or
wander
abroad
on
a
night
of
stars
you
will
not
sit
in
the
on
the
hard
nights
or
go
to
bed
or
rise
again
or
do
anything
at
all
from
this
day
out
who
will
gather
pine
cones
now
when
the
fire
is
going
down
or
call
my
name
in
the
empty
house
or
be
angry
when
the
kettle
is
not
boiling
now
i
am
desolate
indeed
i
have
no
knowledge
i
have
no
husband
i
have
no
more
to
if
i
had
anything
better
you
should
have
it
said
she
politely
to
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
thank
you
said
the
thin
woman
it
was
very
nice
shall
i
begin
now
my
husband
is
meditating
and
we
may
be
able
to
annoy
don
t
trouble
yourself
replied
the
other
i
am
past
enjoyment
and
am
moreover
a
respectable
that
is
no
more
than
the
truth
i
have
always
done
the
right
thing
at
the
right
i
d
be
the
last
body
in
the
world
to
deny
that
was
the
warm
response
very
well
then
said
the
grey
woman
and
she
commenced
to
take
off
her
boots
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
balanced
herself
on
her
toe
you
are
a
decent
respectable
lady
said
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
and
then
the
grey
woman
began
to
gyrate
rapidly
and
more
rapidly
until
she
was
a
very
fervour
of
motion
and
in
of
an
hour
for
she
was
very
tough
she
began
to
slacken
grew
visible
wobbled
and
fell
beside
her
dead
husband
and
on
her
face
was
a
beatitude
almost
surpassing
his
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
smacked
the
children
and
put
them
to
bed
next
she
buried
the
two
bodies
under
the
hearthstone
and
then
with
some
trouble
detached
her
husband
from
his
meditations
when
he
became
capable
of
ordinary
occurrences
she
detailed
all
that
had
happened
and
said
that
he
alone
was
to
blame
for
the
sad
bereavement
he
replied
the
toxin
generates
the
the
end
lies
concealed
in
the
beginning
all
bodies
grow
around
a
skeleton
life
is
a
petticoat
about
death
i
will
not
go
to
chapter
iii
on
the
day
following
this
melancholy
occurrence
meehawl
macmurrachu
a
small
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
came
through
the
pine
trees
with
tangled
brows
at
the
door
of
the
little
house
he
said
god
be
with
all
here
and
marched
in
the
philosopher
removed
his
pipe
from
his
god
be
with
yourself
said
he
and
he
replaced
his
pipe
meehawl
macmurrachu
crooked
his
thumb
at
space
where
is
the
other
one
said
he
ah
said
the
philosopher
he
might
be
outside
maybe
he
might
indeed
said
the
philosopher
gravely
well
it
doesn
t
matter
said
the
visitor
for
you
have
enough
knowledge
by
yourself
to
stock
a
shop
the
reason
i
came
here
was
to
ask
your
honoured
advice
about
my
wife
s
she
only
has
it
a
couple
of
years
and
the
last
time
she
used
it
was
when
she
washed
out
my
sunday
shirt
and
her
black
skirt
with
the
red
things
on
it
you
know
the
one
i
do
not
said
the
philosopher
well
anyhow
the
washboard
is
gone
and
my
wife
says
it
was
either
taken
by
the
fairies
or
by
bessie
hannigan
you
know
bessie
hannigan
she
has
whiskers
like
a
goat
and
a
lame
leg
i
do
not
said
the
philosopher
no
matter
said
meehawl
macmurrachu
she
didn
t
take
it
because
my
wife
got
her
out
yesterday
and
kept
her
talking
for
two
hours
while
i
went
through
everything
in
her
bit
of
a
house
the
washboard
wasn
t
it
wouldn
t
be
said
the
philosopher
maybe
your
honour
could
tell
a
body
where
it
is
then
maybe
i
could
said
the
philosopher
are
you
listening
i
am
said
meehawl
macmurrachu
the
philosopher
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
visitor
until
their
knees
were
jammed
together
he
laid
both
his
hands
on
meehawl
macmurrachu
s
knees
washing
is
an
extraordinary
custom
said
he
we
are
washed
both
on
coming
into
the
world
and
on
going
out
of
it
and
we
take
no
pleasure
from
the
first
washing
nor
any
profit
from
the
true
for
you
sir
said
meehawl
macmurrachu
many
people
consider
that
scourings
supplementary
to
these
are
only
due
to
habit
now
habit
is
continuity
of
action
it
is
a
most
detestable
thing
and
is
very
difficult
to
get
away
from
a
proverb
will
run
where
a
writ
will
not
and
the
follies
of
our
forefathers
are
of
greater
importance
to
us
than
is
the
of
our
i
wouldn
t
say
a
word
against
that
sir
said
meehawl
macmurrachu
cats
are
a
philosophic
and
thoughtful
race
but
they
do
not
admit
the
efficacy
of
either
water
or
soap
and
yet
it
is
usually
conceded
that
they
are
cleanly
folk
there
are
exceptions
to
every
rule
and
i
once
knew
a
cat
who
lusted
after
water
and
bathed
daily
he
was
an
unnatural
brute
and
died
ultimately
of
the
head
staggers
children
are
nearly
as
wise
as
cats
it
is
true
that
they
will
utilize
water
in
a
variety
of
ways
for
instance
the
destruction
of
a
tablecloth
or
a
pinafore
and
i
have
observed
them
greasing
a
ladder
with
soap
showing
in
the
process
a
great
knowledge
of
the
properties
of
this
why
shouldn
t
they
to
be
sure
said
meehawl
macmurrachu
have
you
got
a
match
sir
i
have
not
said
the
philosopher
sparrows
again
are
a
highly
acute
and
reasonable
folk
they
use
water
to
quench
thirst
but
when
they
are
dirty
they
take
a
dust
bath
and
are
at
once
cleansed
of
course
birds
are
often
seen
in
the
water
but
they
go
there
to
catch
fish
and
not
to
wash
i
have
often
fancied
that
fish
are
a
dirty
sly
and
unintelligent
people
this
is
due
to
their
staying
so
much
in
the
water
and
it
has
been
observed
that
on
being
removed
from
this
element
they
at
once
expire
through
sheer
ecstasy
at
escaping
from
their
prolonged
i
have
seen
them
doing
it
myself
said
meehawl
did
you
ever
hear
sir
about
the
fish
that
paudeen
macloughlin
caught
in
the
policeman
s
i
did
not
said
the
philosopher
the
first
person
who
washed
was
possibly
a
person
seeking
a
cheap
notoriety
any
fool
can
wash
himself
but
every
wise
man
knows
that
it
is
an
unnecessary
labour
for
nature
will
quickly
reduce
him
to
a
natural
and
healthy
dirtiness
again
we
should
seek
therefore
not
how
to
make
ourselves
clean
but
how
to
attain
a
more
unique
and
splendid
dirtiness
and
perhaps
the
accumulated
layers
of
matter
might
by
ordinary
geologic
compulsion
become
incorporated
with
the
human
cuticle
and
so
render
clothing
unnecessary
about
that
washboard
said
meehawl
i
was
just
going
to
say
it
doesn
t
matter
said
the
philosopher
in
its
proper
place
i
admit
the
necessity
for
water
as
a
thing
to
sail
a
ship
on
it
can
scarcely
be
surpassed
not
you
will
understand
that
i
entirely
approve
of
ships
they
tend
to
create
and
perpetuate
international
curiosity
and
the
smaller
vermin
of
different
latitudes
as
an
element
wherewith
to
put
out
a
fire
or
brew
tea
or
make
a
slide
in
winter
it
is
useful
but
in
a
tin
basin
it
has
a
repulsive
and
meagre
now
as
to
your
wife
s
washboard
good
luck
to
your
honour
said
meehawl
your
wife
says
that
either
the
fairies
or
a
woman
with
a
goat
s
leg
has
it
s
her
whiskers
said
meehawl
they
are
lame
said
the
philosopher
sternly
have
it
your
own
way
sir
i
m
not
certain
now
how
the
creature
is
you
say
that
this
unhealthy
woman
has
not
got
your
wife
s
washboard
it
remains
therefore
that
the
fairies
have
it
looks
that
way
said
meehawl
there
are
six
clans
of
fairies
living
in
this
neighbourhood
but
the
process
of
elimination
which
has
shaped
the
world
to
a
globe
the
ant
to
its
environment
and
man
to
the
captaincy
of
the
vertebrates
will
not
fail
in
this
instance
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
the
way
wasps
have
increased
this
season
said
meehawl
faith
you
can
t
sit
down
anywhere
but
your
breeches
i
did
not
said
the
philosopher
did
you
leave
out
a
pan
of
milk
on
last
tuesday
i
did
do
you
take
off
your
hat
when
you
meet
a
dust
twirl
i
wouldn
t
neglect
that
said
meehawl
did
you
cut
down
a
thorn
bush
recently
i
d
sooner
cut
my
eye
out
said
meehawl
and
go
about
as
as
lorcan
o
nualain
s
ass
i
would
that
did
you
ever
see
his
ass
sir
it
i
did
not
said
the
philosopher
did
you
kill
a
robin
redbreast
never
said
meehawl
by
the
pipers
he
added
that
old
skinny
cat
of
mine
caught
a
bird
on
the
roof
hah
cried
the
philosopher
moving
if
it
were
possible
even
closer
to
his
client
now
we
have
it
it
is
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
took
your
washboard
go
to
the
gort
at
once
there
is
a
hole
under
a
tree
in
the
of
the
field
try
what
you
will
find
in
that
i
ll
do
that
said
meehawl
did
you
i
did
not
said
the
philosopher
so
meehawl
macmurrachu
went
away
and
did
as
he
had
been
bidden
and
underneath
the
tree
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
he
found
a
little
crock
of
gold
there
s
a
power
of
washboards
in
that
said
he
by
reason
of
this
incident
the
fame
of
the
philosopher
became
even
greater
than
it
had
been
before
and
also
by
reason
of
it
many
singular
events
were
to
happen
with
which
you
shall
duly
become
acquainted
chapter
iv
it
so
happened
that
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
were
not
thankful
to
the
philosopher
for
having
sent
meehawl
macmurrachu
to
their
field
in
stealing
meehawl
s
property
they
were
quite
within
their
rights
because
their
bird
had
undoubtedly
been
slain
by
his
cat
not
alone
therefore
was
their
righteous
vengeance
nullified
but
the
crock
of
gold
which
had
taken
their
community
many
thousands
of
years
to
amass
was
stolen
a
leprecaun
without
a
pot
of
gold
is
like
a
rose
without
perfume
a
bird
without
a
wing
or
an
inside
without
an
outside
they
considered
that
the
philosopher
had
treated
them
badly
that
his
action
was
mischievous
and
unneighbourly
and
that
until
they
were
adequately
compensated
for
their
loss
both
of
treasure
and
dignity
no
conditions
other
than
those
of
enmity
could
exist
between
their
people
and
the
little
house
in
the
pine
wood
furthermore
for
them
the
situation
was
cruelly
complicated
they
were
unable
to
organise
a
direct
personal
hostility
against
their
new
enemy
because
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
would
certainly
protect
her
husband
she
belonged
to
the
shee
of
croghan
conghaile
who
had
relatives
in
every
fairy
fort
in
ireland
and
were
also
strongly
represented
in
the
forts
and
duns
of
their
immediate
neighbours
they
could
of
course
have
called
an
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
sheogs
leprecauns
and
cluricauns
and
presented
their
case
with
a
claim
for
damages
against
the
shee
of
croghan
conghaile
but
that
clann
would
assuredly
repudiate
any
liability
on
the
ground
that
no
member
of
their
fraternity
was
responsible
for
the
outrage
as
it
was
the
philosopher
and
not
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
who
had
done
the
deed
notwithstanding
this
they
were
unwilling
to
let
the
matter
rest
and
the
fact
that
justice
was
out
of
reach
only
added
fury
to
their
anger
one
of
their
number
was
sent
to
interview
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
and
the
others
concentrated
nightly
about
the
dwelling
of
meehawl
macmurrachu
in
an
endeavour
to
recapture
the
treasure
which
they
were
quite
satisfied
was
hopeless
they
found
that
meehawl
who
understood
the
customs
of
the
earth
folk
very
well
had
buried
the
crock
of
gold
beneath
a
thorn
bush
thereby
placing
it
under
the
protection
of
every
fairy
in
the
world
the
leprecauns
themselves
included
and
until
it
was
removed
from
this
place
by
human
hands
they
were
bound
to
respect
its
and
even
guarantee
its
safety
with
their
blood
they
afflicted
meehawl
with
an
extraordinary
attack
of
rheumatism
and
his
wife
with
an
equally
virulent
sciatica
but
they
got
no
lasting
pleasure
from
their
groans
the
leprecaun
who
had
been
detailed
to
visit
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
duly
arrived
at
the
cottage
in
the
pine
wood
and
made
his
complaint
the
little
man
wept
as
he
told
the
story
and
the
two
children
wept
out
of
sympathy
for
him
the
thin
woman
said
she
was
desperately
grieved
by
the
whole
unpleasant
transaction
and
that
all
her
sympathies
were
with
gort
na
cloca
mora
but
that
she
must
disassociate
herself
from
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
as
it
was
her
husband
who
was
the
culpable
person
and
that
she
had
no
control
over
his
mental
processes
which
she
concluded
was
one
of
the
seven
curious
things
in
the
world
as
her
husband
was
away
in
a
distant
part
of
the
wood
nothing
further
could
be
done
at
that
time
so
the
leprecaun
returned
again
to
his
fellows
without
any
good
news
but
he
promised
to
come
back
early
on
the
following
day
when
the
philosopher
come
home
late
that
night
the
thin
woman
was
waiting
up
for
him
woman
said
the
philosopher
you
ought
to
be
in
ought
i
indeed
said
the
thin
woman
i
d
have
you
know
that
i
ll
go
to
bed
when
i
like
and
get
up
when
i
like
without
asking
your
or
any
one
else
s
that
is
not
true
said
the
philosopher
you
get
sleepy
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
you
awaken
again
without
your
permission
being
asked
like
many
other
customs
such
as
singing
dancing
music
and
acting
sleep
has
crept
into
popular
favour
as
part
of
a
religious
ceremonial
nowhere
can
one
go
to
sleep
more
easily
than
in
a
do
you
know
said
the
thin
woman
that
a
leprecaun
came
here
i
do
not
said
the
philosopher
and
notwithstanding
the
innumerable
centuries
which
have
elapsed
since
that
first
sleeper
probably
with
extreme
difficulty
sank
into
his
religious
trance
we
can
sleep
through
a
religious
ceremony
with
an
ease
which
would
have
been
a
source
of
wealth
and
fame
to
that
prehistoric
worshipper
and
his
are
you
going
to
listen
to
what
i
am
telling
you
about
the
leprecaun
said
the
thin
woman
i
am
not
said
the
philosopher
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
go
to
sleep
at
night
because
it
is
then
too
dark
to
do
anything
else
but
owls
who
are
a
venerably
sagacious
folk
do
not
sleep
in
the
night
time
bats
also
are
a
very
race
they
sleep
in
the
broadest
day
and
they
do
it
in
a
charming
manner
they
clutch
the
branch
of
a
tree
with
their
toes
and
hang
head
downwards
a
position
which
i
consider
singularly
happy
for
the
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
consequent
on
this
inverted
position
should
engender
a
drowsiness
and
a
certain
imbecility
of
mind
which
must
either
sleep
or
will
you
never
be
done
talking
shouted
the
thin
woman
passionately
i
will
not
said
the
philosopher
in
certain
ways
sleep
is
useful
it
is
an
excellent
way
of
listening
to
an
opera
or
seeing
pictures
on
a
bioscope
as
a
medium
for
i
know
of
nothing
that
can
equal
it
as
an
accomplishment
it
is
graceful
but
as
a
means
of
spending
a
night
it
is
intolerably
ridiculous
if
you
were
going
to
say
anything
my
love
please
say
it
now
but
you
should
always
remember
to
think
before
you
speak
a
woman
should
be
seen
seldom
but
never
heard
quietness
is
the
beginning
of
virtue
to
be
silent
is
to
be
beautiful
stars
do
not
make
a
noise
children
should
always
be
in
bed
these
are
serious
truths
which
can
not
be
controverted
therefore
silence
is
fitting
as
regards
your
stirabout
is
on
the
hob
said
the
thin
woman
you
can
get
it
for
yourself
i
would
not
move
the
breadth
of
my
nail
if
you
were
dying
of
hunger
i
hope
there
s
lumps
in
it
a
leprecaun
from
gort
na
cloca
mora
was
here
they
ll
give
it
to
you
for
robbing
their
pot
of
gold
you
old
thief
you
you
lobeared
the
thin
woman
whizzed
suddenly
from
where
she
stood
and
leaped
into
bed
from
beneath
the
blanket
she
turned
a
vivid
furious
eye
on
her
husband
she
was
trying
to
give
him
rheumatism
and
toothache
and
lockjaw
all
at
once
if
she
had
been
satisfied
to
concentrate
her
attention
on
one
only
of
these
torments
she
might
have
succeeded
in
afflicting
her
husband
according
to
her
wish
but
she
was
not
able
to
do
that
finality
is
death
perfection
is
finality
nothing
is
perfect
there
are
lumps
in
it
said
the
philosopher
chapter
v
when
the
leprecaun
came
through
the
pine
wood
on
the
following
day
he
met
two
children
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
he
raised
his
open
right
hand
above
his
head
this
is
both
the
fairy
and
the
gaelic
form
of
salutation
and
would
have
passed
on
but
that
a
thought
brought
him
to
a
halt
sitting
down
before
the
two
children
he
stared
at
them
for
a
long
time
and
they
stared
back
at
him
at
last
he
said
to
the
boy
what
is
your
name
a
vic
vig
o
seumas
beg
sir
the
boy
replied
it
s
a
little
name
said
the
leprecaun
it
s
what
my
mother
calls
me
sir
returned
the
boy
what
does
your
father
call
you
was
the
next
question
seumas
roghan
maelduin
o
carbhail
mac
an
it
s
a
big
name
said
the
leprecaun
and
he
turned
to
the
little
girl
what
is
your
name
a
cailin
vig
o
brigid
beg
and
what
does
your
father
call
you
he
never
calls
me
at
all
well
seumaseen
and
breedeen
you
are
good
little
children
and
i
like
you
very
much
health
be
with
you
until
i
come
to
see
you
and
then
the
leprecaun
went
back
the
way
he
had
come
as
he
went
he
made
little
jumps
and
cracked
his
fingers
and
sometimes
he
rubbed
one
leg
against
the
other
that
s
a
nice
leprecaun
said
seumas
i
like
him
too
said
brigid
listen
said
seumas
let
me
be
the
leprecaun
and
you
be
the
two
children
and
i
will
ask
you
our
so
they
did
that
the
next
day
the
leprecaun
came
again
he
sat
down
beside
the
children
and
as
before
he
was
silent
for
a
little
time
are
you
not
going
to
ask
us
our
names
sir
said
seumas
his
sister
smoothed
out
her
dress
shyly
my
name
sir
is
brigid
beg
said
she
did
you
ever

jackstones
said
the
leprecaun
no
sir
replied
seumas
i
ll
teach
you
how
to
play
jackstones
said
the
leprecaun
and
he
picked
up
some
pine
cones
and
taught
the
children
that
game
did
you
ever
play
ball
in
the
decker
no
sir
said
seumas

seumas

leprecaun
and

and
yards

the
s
tail
and
towns
and
relievo
and
i
ll

these
games
said
the
leprecaun
and
i
ll
teach
you
how
to
play
knifey
and
and
horneys
and
robbers
is
the
best
one
to
start
with
so
i
ll
teach
it
to
you
at
once
let
you
bend
down
like
this
breedeen
and
you
bend

like
that
a
good
distance
away
seumas
now

back
and
then
i

again
and
i

breedeen

brother
and
then
you

good
bit

now
seumas

s
your
turn
you
jump
over
me
and
then
over
your
sister
and
then
you
run
on
and
bend
down
again
and
i
this
is
a
fine
game
sir
said
seumas
it
is
a
vic
vig
keep
in
your
head
said
the
leprecaun
that
s
a
good
jump
you
couldn
t
beat
that
jump
i
can
jump
better
than
brigid
already
replied
seumas
and
i
ll
jump
as
well
as
you
do
when
i
get
more
practice
keep
in
your
head
almost
without
noticing
it
they
had
passed
through
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
were
playing
into
a
rough
field
which
was
cumbered
with
big
grey
rocks
it
was
the
very
last
field
in
sight
and
behind
it
the
rough
mountain
sloped
distantly
away
to
the
skyline
there
was
a
raggedy
blackberry
hedge
all
round
the
field
and
there
were
long
tough
plants
growing
in
clumps
here
and
there
near
a
corner
of
this
field
there
was
a
broad
low
tree
and
as
they
played
they
came
near
and
nearer
to
it
the
leprecaun
gave
a
back
very
close
to
the
tree
seumas
ran
and
jumped
and
slid
down
a
hole
at
the
side
of
the
tree
then
brigid
ran
and
jumped
and
slid
down
the
same
hole
dear
me
said
brigid
and
she
flashed
out
of
sight
the
leprecaun
cracked
his
fingers
and
rubbed
one
leg
against
the
other
and
then
he
also
dived
into
the
hole
and
disappeared
from
view
when
the
time
at
which
the
children
usually
went
home
had
passed
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
became
a
little
anxious
she
had
never
known
them
to
be
late
for
dinner
before
there
was
one
of
the
children
whom
she
hated
it
was
her
own
child
but
as
she
had
forgotten
which
of
them
was
hers
and
as
she
loved
one
of
them
she
was
compelled
to
love
both
for
fear
of
making
a
mistake
and
chastising
the
child
for
whom
her
heart
secretly
yearned
therefore
she
was
equally
concerned
about
both
of
them
dinner
time
passed
and
supper
time
arrived
but
the
children
did
not
again
and
again
the
thin
woman
went
out
through
the
dark
pine
trees
and
called
until
she
was
so
hoarse
that
she
could
not
even
hear
herself
when
she
roared
the
evening
wore
on
to
the
night
and
while
she
waited
for
the
philosopher
to
come
in
she
reviewed
the
situation
her
husband
had
not
come
in
the
children
had
not
come
in
the
leprecaun
had
not
returned
as
arranged
a
light
flashed
upon
her
the
leprecaun
had
kidnapped
her
children
she
announced
a
vengeance
against
the
leprecauns
which
would
stagger
humanity
while
in
the
extreme
centre
of
her
ecstasy
the
philosopher
came
through
the
trees
and
entered
the
house
the
thin
woman
flew
to
husband
said
she
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
have
kidnapped
our
the
philosopher
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
kidnapping
said
he
has
been
for
many
centuries
a
favourite
occupation
of
fairies
gypsies
and
the
brigands
of
the
east
the
usual
procedure
is
to
attach
a
person
and
hold
it
to
ransom
if
the
ransom
is
not
paid
an
ear
or
a
finger
may
be
cut
from
the
captive
and
despatched
to
those
interested
with
the
statement
that
an
arm
or
a
leg
will
follow
in
a
week
unless
suitable
arrangements
are
entered
do
you
understand
said
the
thin
woman
passionately
that
it
is
your
own
children
who
have
been
kidnapped
i
do
not
said
the
philosopher
this
course
however
is
rarely
followed
by
the
fairy
people
they
do
not
ordinarily
steal
for
ransom
but
for
love
of
thieving
or
from
some
other
obscure
and
possibly
functional
causes
and
the
victim
is
retained
in
their
forts
or
duns
until
by
the
effluxion
of
time
they
forget
their
origin
and
become
peaceable
citizens
of
the
fairy
state
kidnapping
is
not
by
any
means
confined
to
either
humanity
or
the
fairy
monster
said
the
thin
woman
in
a
deep
voice
will
you
listen
to
me
i
will
not
said
the
philosopher
many
of
the
insectivora
also
practice
this
custom
ants
for
example
are
a
respectable
race
living
in
communities
they
have
attained
to
a
most
complex
and
artificial
civilization
and
will
frequently
adventure
far
afield
on
colonising
or
other
expeditions
from
whence
they
return
with
a
rich
booty
of
aphides
and
other
stock
who
thenceforward
become
the
servants
and
domestic
creatures
of
the
republic
as
they
neither
kill
nor
eat
their
captives
this
practice
will
be
termed
kidnapping
the
same
may
be
said
of
bees
a
hardy
and
industrious
race
living
in
hexagonal
cells
which
are
very
difficult
to
make
sometimes
on
lacking
a
queen
of
their
own
they
have
been
observed
to
abduct
one
from
a
less
powerful
neighbour
and
use
her
for
their
own
purposes
without
shame
mercy
or
will
you
not
understand
screamed
the
thin
woman
i
will
not
said
the
philosopher
apes
have
been
rumoured
to
kidnap
children
and
are
reported
to
use
them
very
tenderly
indeed
sharing
their
coconuts
yams
plantains
and
other
equatorial
provender
with
the
largest
generosity
and
conveying
their
delicate
captives
from
tree
to
tree
often
at
great
distances
from
each
other
and
from
the
ground
with
the
most
guarded
solicitude
and
i
am
going
to
bed
said
the
thin
woman
your
stirabout
is
on
the
are
there
lumps
in
it
my
dear
said
the
philosopher
i
hope
there
are
replied
the
thin
woman
and
she
leaped
into
bed
that
night
the
philosopher
was
afflicted
with
the
most
extraordinary
attack
of
rheumatism
he
had
ever
known
nor
did
he
get
any
ease
until
the
grey
morning
wearied
his
lady
into
a
reluctant
slumber
chapter
vi
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
slept
very
late
that
morning
but
when
she
did
awaken
her
impatience
was
so
urgent
that
she
could
scarcely
delay
to
eat
her
breakfast
immediately
after
she
had
eaten
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
went
through
the
pine
wood
in
the
direction
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
in
a
short
time
she
reached
the
rocky
field
and
walking
over
to
the
tree
in
the
southeast
corner
she
picked
up
a
small
stone
and
hammered
loudly
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
she
hammered
in
a
peculiar
fashion
giving
two
knocks
and
then
three
knocks
and
then
one
knock
a
voice
came
up
from
the
hole
who
is
that
please
said
the
voice
ban
na
droid
of
inis
magrath
and
well
you
know
it
was
her
reply
i
am
coming
up
noble
woman
said
the
voice
and
in
another
moment
the
leprecaun
leaped
out
of
the
hole
where
are
seumas
and
brigid
beg
said
the
thin
woman
sternly
how
would
i
know
where
they
are
replied
the
leprecaun
wouldn
t
they
be
at
home
now
if
they
were
at
home
i
wouldn
t
have
come
here
looking
for
them
was
her
reply
it
is
my
belief
that
you
have
search
me
said
the
leprecaun
opening
his
waistcoat
they
are
down
there
in
your
little
house
said
the
thin
woman
angrily
and
the
sooner
you
let
them
up
the
better
it
will
be
for
yourself
and
your
five
noble
woman
said
the
leprecaun
you
can
go
down
yourself
into
our
little
house
and
look
i
can
t
say
fairer
than
i
wouldn
t
fit
down
there
said
she
i
m
too
you
know
the
way
for
making
yourself
little
replied
the
leprecaun
but
i
mightn
t
be
able
to
make
myself
big
again
said
the
thin
woman
and
then
you
and
your
dirty
brothers
would
have
it
all
your
own
way
if
you
don
t
let
the
children
up
she
continued
i
ll
raise
the
shee
of
croghan
conghaile
against
you
you
know
what
happened
to
the
cluricauns
of
oilean
na
glas
when
they
stole
the
queen
s
baby
it
will
be
a
worse
thing
than
that
for
you
if
the
children
are
not
back
in
my
house
before
moonrise
this
night
i
ll
go
round
to
my
people
just
tell
that
to
your
five
ugly
brothers
health
with
you
she
added
and
strode
away
health
with
yourself
noble
woman
said
the
leprecaun
and
he
stood
on
one
leg
until
she
was
out
of
sight
and
then
he
slid
down
into
the
hole
again
when
the
thin
woman
was
going
back
through
the
pine
wood
she
saw
meehawl
macmurrachu
travelling
in
the
same
direction
and
his
brows
were
in
a
tangle
of
perplexity
god
be
with
you
meehawl
macmurrachu
said
she
god
and
mary
be
with
you
ma
am
he
replied
i
am
in
great
trouble
this
why
wouldn
t
you
be
said
the
thin
woman
i
came
up
to
have
a
talk
with
your
husband
about
a
particular
if
it
s
talk
you
want
you
have
come
to
a
good
house
he
s
a
powerful
man
right
enough
said
meehawl
after
a
few
minutes
the
thin
woman
spoke
again
i
can
get
the
reek
of
his
pipe
from
here
let
you
go
right
in
to
him
now
and
i
ll
stay
outside
for
a
while
for
the
sound
of
your
two
voices
would
give
me
a
pain
in
my
whatever
will
please
you
will
please
me
ma
am
said
her
companion
and
he
went
into
the
little
house
meehawl
macmurrachu
had
good
reason
to
be
perplexed
he
was
the
father
of
one
child
only
and
she
was
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
whole
world
the
pity
of
it
was
that
no
one
at
all
knew
she
was
beautiful
and
she
did
not
even
know
it
herself
at
times
when
she
bathed
in
the
eddy
of
a
mountain
stream
and
saw
her
reflection
looking
up
from
the
placid
water
she
thought
that
she
looked
very
nice
and
then
a
great
sadness
would
come
upon
her
for
what
is
the
use
of
looking
nice
if
there
is
nobody
to
see
one
s
beauty
beauty
also
is
usefulness
the
arts
as
well
as
the
crafts
the
graces
equally
with
the
utilities
must
stand
up
in
the
marketplace
and
be
judged
by
the
gombeen
men
the
only
house
near
to
her
father
s
was
that
occupied
by
bessie
hannigan
the
other
few
houses
were
scattered
widely
with
long
quiet
miles
of
hill
and
bog
between
them
so
that
she
had
hardly
seen
more
than
a
couple
of
men
beside
her
father
since
she
was
born
she
helped
her
father
and
mother
in
all
the
small
businesses
of
their
house
and
every
day
also
she
drove
their
three
cows
and
two
goats
to
pasture
on
the
mountain
slopes
here
through
the
sunny
days
the
years
had
passed
in
a
slow
warm
thoughtlessness
wherein
without
thinking
many
thoughts
had
entered
into
her
mind
and
many
pictures
hung
for
a
moment
like
birds
in
the
thin
air
at
first
and
for
a
long
time
she
had
been
happy
enough
there
were
many
things
in
which
a
child
might
be
interested
the
spacious
heavens
which
never
wore
the
same
beauty
on
any
day
the
innumerable
little
creatures
living
among
the
grasses
or
in
the
heather
the
steep
swing
of
a
bird
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
infinite
plains
below
the
little
flowers
which
were
so
contented
each
in
its
peaceful
place
the
bees
gathering
food
for
their
houses
and
the
stout
beetles
who
are
always
losing
their
way
in
the
dusk
these
things
and
many
others
interested
her
the
three
cows
after
they
had
grazed
for
a
long
time
would
come
and
lie
by
her
side
and
look
at
her
as
they
chewed
their
cud
and
the
goats
would
prance
from
the
bracken
to
push
their
heads
against
her
breast
because
they
loved
her
indeed
everything
in
her
quiet
world
loved
this
girl
but
very
slowly
there
was
growing
in
her
consciousness
an
unrest
a
disquietude
to
which
she
had
hitherto
been
a
stranger
sometimes
an
infinite
weariness
oppressed
her
to
the
earth
a
thought
was
born
in
her
mind
and
it
had
no
name
it
was
growing
and
could
not
be
expressed
she
had
no
words
wherewith
to
meet
it
to
exorcise
or
greet
this
stranger
who
more
and
more
insistently
and
pleadingly
tapped
upon
her
doors
and
begged
to
be
spoken
to
admitted
and
caressed
and
nourished
a
thought
is
a
real
thing
and
words
are
only
its
raiment
but
a
thought
is
as
shy
as
a
virgin
unless
it
is
fittingly
apparelled
we
may
not
look
on
its
shadowy
nakedness
it
will
fly
from
us
and
only
return
again
in
the
darkness
crying
in
a
thin
childish
voice
which
we
may
not
comprehend
until
with
aching
minds
listening
and
divining
we
at
last
fashion
for
it
those
symbols
which
are
its
protection
and
its
banner
so
she
could
not
understand
the
touch
that
came
to
her
from
afar
and
yet
how
intimately
the
whisper
so
aloof
and
yet
so
thrillingly
personal
the
standard
of
either
language
or
experience
was
not
hers
she
could
listen
but
not
think
she
could
feel
but
not
know
her
eyes
looked
forward
and
did
not
see
her
hands
groped
in
the
sunlight
and
felt
nothing
it
was
like
the
edge
of
a
little
wind
which
stirred
her
tresses
but
could
not
lift
them
or
the
first
white
peep
of
the
dawn
which
is
neither
light
nor
darkness
but
she
listened
not
with
her
ears
but
with
her
blood
the
fingers
of
her
soul
stretched
out
to
clasp
a
stranger
s
hand
and
her
disquietude
was
quickened
through
with
an
eagerness
which
was
neither
physical
nor
mental
for
neither
her
body
nor
her
mind
was
definitely
interested
some
dim
region
between
these
grew
alarmed
and
watched
and
waited
and
did
not
sleep
or
grow
weary
at
all
one
morning
she
lay
among
the
long
warm
grasses
she
watched
a
bird
who
soared
and
sang
for
a
little
time
and
then
it
sped
swiftly
away
down
the
steep
air
and
out
of
sight
in
the
blue
distance
even
when
it
was
gone
the
song
seemed
to
ring
in
her
ears
it
seemed
to
linger
with
her
as
a
faint
sweet
echo
coming
fitfully
with
little
pauses
as
though
a
wind
disturbed
it
and
careless
distant
eddies
after
a
few
moments
she
knew
it
was
not
a
bird
no
bird
s
song
had
that
consecutive
melody
for
their
themes
are
as
careless
as
their
wings
she
sat
up
and
looked
about
her
but
there
was
nothing
in
sight
the
mountains
sloped
gently
above
her
and
away
to
the
clear
sky
around
her
the
scattered
clumps
of
heather
were
drowsing
in
the
sunlight
far
below
she
could
see
her
father
s
house
a
little
grey
patch
near
some
then
the
music
stopped
and
left
her
wondering
she
could
not
find
her
goats
anywhere
although
for
a
long
time
she
searched
they
came
to
her
at
last
of
their
own
accord
from
behind
a
fold
in
the
hills
and
they
were
more
wildly
excited
than
she
had
ever
seen
them
before
even
the
cows
forsook
their
solemnity
and
broke
into
awkward
gambols
around
her
as
she
walked
home
that
evening
a
strange
elation
taught
her
feet
to
dance
hither
and
thither
she
flitted
in
front
of
the
beasts
and
behind
them
her
feet
tripped
to
a
wayward
measure
there
was
a
tune
in
her
ears
and
she
danced
to
it
throwing
her
arms
out
and
above
her
head
and
swaying
and
bending
as
she
went
the
full
freedom
of
her
body
was
hers
now
the
lightness
and
poise
and
certainty
of
her
limbs
delighted
her
and
the
strength
that
did
not
tire
delighted
her
also
the
evening
was
full
of
peace
and
quietude
the
mellow
dusky
sunlight
made
a
path
for
her
feet
and
everywhere
through
the
wide
fields
birds
were
flashing
and
singing
and
she
sang
with
them
a
song
that
had
no
words
and
wanted
none
the
following
day
she
heard
the
music
again
faint
and
thin
wonderfully
sweet
and
as
wild
as
the
song
of
a
bird
but
it
was
a
melody
which
no
bird
would
adhere
to
a
theme
was
repeated
again
and
again
in
the
middle
of
trills
runs
and
catches
it
recurred
with
a
strange
almost
holy
solemnity
a
hushing
slender
melody
full
of
austerity
and
aloofness
there
was
something
in
it
to
set
her
heart
beating
she
yearned
to
it
with
her
ears
and
her
lips
was
it
joy
menace
carelessness
she
did
not
know
but
this
she
did
know
that
however
terrible
it
was
personal
to
her
it
was
her
unborn
thought
strangely
audible
and
felt
rather
than
understood
on
that
day
she
did
not
see
anybody
either
she
drove
her
charges
home
in
the
evening
listlessly
and
the
beasts
also
were
very
quiet
when
the
music
came
again
she
made
no
effort
to
discover
where
it
came
from
she
only
listened
and
when
the
tune
was
ended
she
saw
a
figure
rise
from
the
fold
of
a
little
hill
the
sunlight
was
gleaming
from
his
arms
and
shoulders
but
the
rest
of
his
body
was
hidden
by
the
bracken
and
he
did
not
look
at
her
as
he
went
away
playing
softly
on
a
double
pipe
the
next
day
he
did
look
at
her
he
stood
in
greenery
fronting
her
squarely
she
had
never
seen
so
strange
a
face
before
her
eyes
almost
died
on
him
as
she
gazed
and
he
returned
her
look
for
a
long
minute
with
an
intent
expressionless
regard
his
hair
was
a
cluster
of
brown
curls
his
nose
was
little
and
straight
and
his
wide
mouth
drooped
sadly
at
the
corners
his
eyes
were
wide
and
most
mournful
and
his
forehead
was
very
broad
and
white
his
sad
eyes
and
mouth
almost
made
her
weep
when
he
turned
away
he
smiled
at
her
and
it
was
as
though
the
sun
had
shone
suddenly
in
a
dark
place
banishing
all
sadness
and
gloom
then
he
went
mincingly
away
as
he
went
he
lifted
the
slender
double
reed
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
few
careless
notes
the
next
day
he
fronted
her
as
before
looking
down
to
her
eyes
from
a
short
distance
he
played
for
only
a
few
moments
and
fitfully
and
then
he
came
to
her
when
he
left
the
bracken
the
girl
suddenly
clapped
her
hands
against
her
eyes
affrighted
there
was
something
different
terrible
about
him
the
upper
part
of
his
body
was
beautiful
but
the
lower
part
she
dared
not
look
at
him
again
she
would
have
risen
and
fled
away
but
she
feared
he
might
pursue
her
and
the
thought
of
such
a
chase
and
the
inevitable
capture
froze
her
blood
the
thought
of
anything
behind
us
is
always
terrible
the
sound
of
pursuing
feet
is
worse
than
the
murder
from
which
we
fly
so
she
sat
still
and
waited
but
nothing
happened
at
last
desperately
she
dropped
her
hands
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
a
few
paces
from
her
he
was
not
looking
at
her
but
far
away
sidewards
across
the
spreading
hill
his
legs
were
crossed
they
were
shaggy
and
hoofed
like
the
legs
of
a
goat
but
she
would
not
look
at
these
because
of
his
wonderful
sad
grotesque
face
gaiety
is
good
to
look
upon
and
an
innocent
face
is
delightful
to
our
souls
but
no
woman
can
resist
sadness
or
weakness
and
ugliness
she
dare
not
resist
her
nature
leaps
to
be
the
comforter
it
is
her
reason
it
exalts
her
to
an
ecstasy
wherein
nothing
but
the
sacrifice
of
herself
has
any
proportion
men
are
not
fathers
by
instinct
but
by
chance
but
women
are
mothers
beyond
thought
beyond
instinct
which
is
the
father
of
thought
motherliness
pity
these
are
the
charges
of
her
primal
cell
and
not
even
the
discovery
that
men
are
comedians
liars
and
egotists
will
wean
her
from
this
as
she
looked
at
the
pathos
of
his
face
she
repudiated
the
hideousness
of
his
body
the
beast
which
is
in
all
men
is
glossed
by
women
it
is
his
childishness
the
destructive
energy
inseparable
from
youth
and
high
spirits
and
it
is
always
forgiven
by
women
often
forgotten
sometimes
and
not
rarely
cherished
and
fostered
after
a
few
moments
of
this
silence
he
placed
the
reed
to
his
lips
and
played
a
plaintive
little
air
and
then
he
spoke
to
her
in
a
strange
voice
coming
like
a
wind
from
distant
places
what
is
your
name
shepherd
girl
said
he
caitilin
ingin
ni
murrachu
she
whispered
daughter
of
murrachu
said
he
i
have
come
from
a
far
place
where
there
are
high
hills
the
men
and
maidens
who
follow
their
flocks
in
that
place
know
me
and
love
me
for
i
am
the
master
of
the
shepherds
they
sing
and
dance
and
are
glad
when
i
come
to
them
in
the
sunlight
but
in
this
country
no
people
have
done
any
reverence
to
me
the
shepherds
fly
away
when
they
hear
my
pipes
in
the
pastures
the
maidens
scream
in
fear
when
i
dance
to
them
in
the
meadows
i
am
very
lonely
in
this
strange
country
you
also
although
you
danced
to
the
music
of
my
pipes
have
covered
your
face
against
me
and
made
no
i
will
do
whatever
you
say
if
it
is
right
said
she
you
must
not
do
anything
because
it
is
right
but
because
it
is
your
wish
right
is
a
word
and
wrong
is
a
word
but
the
sun
shines
in
the
morning
and
the
dew
falls
in
the
dusk
without
thinking
of
these
words
which
have
no
meaning
the
bee
flies
to
the
flower
and
the
seed
goes
abroad
and
is
happy
is
that
right
shepherd
girl
it
is
wrong
also
i
come
to
you
because
the
bee
goes
to
the
flower
it
is
wrong
if
i
did
not
come
to
you
to
whom
would
i
go
there
is
no
right
and
no
wrong
but
only
the
will
of
the
i
am
afraid
of
you
said
the
girl
you
fear
me
because
my
legs
are
shaggy
like
the
legs
of
a
goat
look
at
them
well
o
maiden
and
know
that
they
are
indeed
the
legs
of
a
beast
and
then
you
will
not
be
afraid
any
more
do
you
not
love
beasts
surely
you
should
love
them
for
they
yearn
to
you
humbly
or
fiercely
craving
your
hand
upon
their
heads
as
i
do
if
i
were
not
fashioned
thus
i
would
not
come
to
you
because
i
would
not
need
you
man
is
a
god
and
a
brute
he
aspires
to
the
stars
with
his
head
but
his
feet
are
contented
in
the
grasses
of
the
field
and
when
he
forsakes
the
brute
upon
which
he
stands
then
there
will
be
no
more
men
and
no
more
women
and
the
immortal
gods
will
blow
this
world
away
like
i
don
t
know
what
you
want
me
to
do
said
the
girl
i
want
you
to
want
me
i
want
you
to
forget
right
and
wrong
to
be
as
happy
as
the
beasts
as
careless
as
the
flowers
and
the
birds
to
live
to
the
depths
of
your
nature
as
well
as
to
the
heights
truly
there
are
stars
in
the
heights
and
they
will
be
a
garland
for
your
forehead
but
the
depths
are
equal
to
the
heights
wondrous
deep
are
the
depths
very
fertile
is
the
lowest
deep
there
are
stars
there
also
brighter
than
the
stars
on
high
the
name
of
the
heights
is
wisdom
and
the
name
of
the
depths
is
love
how
shall
they
come
together
and
be
fruitful
if
you
do
not
plunge
deeply
and
fearlessly
wisdom
is
the
spirit
and
the
wings
of
the
spirit
love
is
the
shaggy
beast
that
goes
down
gallantly
he
dives
below
thought
beyond
wisdom
to
rise
again
as
high
above
these
as
he
had
first
descended
wisdom
is
righteous
and
clean
but
love
is
unclean
and
holy
i
sing
of
the
beast
and
the
descent
the
great
unclean
purging
itself
in
fire
the
thought
that
is
not
born
in
the
measure
or
the
ice
or
the
head
but
in
the
feet
and
the
hot
blood
and
the
pulse
of
fury
the
crown
of
life
is
not
lodged
in
the
sun
the
wise
gods
have
buried
it
deeply
where
the
thoughtful
will
not
find
it
nor
the
good
but
the
gay
ones
the
adventurous
ones
the
careless
plungers
they
will
bring
it
to
the
wise
and
astonish
them
all
things
are
seen
in
the
light
how
shall
we
value
that
which
is
easy
to
see
but
the
precious
things
which
are
hidden
they
will
be
more
precious
for
our
search
they
will
be
beautiful
with
our
sorrow
they
will
be
noble
because
of
our
desire
for
them
come
away
with
me
shepherd
girl
through
the
fields
and
we
will
be
careless
and
happy
and
we
will
leave
thought
to
find
us
when
it
can
for
that
is
the
duty
of
thought
and
it
is
more
anxious
to
discover
us
than
we
are
to
be
so

d
be
greatly
beholden
to
i
can
give
you
that
replied
the
philosopher
none
better
than
your
honour
and
no
trouble
to
you
either
it
was
a
powerful
advice
you
gave
me
about
the
washboard
and
if
i
didn
t
come
here
to
thank
you
before
this
it
was
not
because
i
didn
t
want
to
come
but
that
i
couldn
t
move
hand
or
foot
by
dint
of
the
cruel
rheumatism
put
upon
me
by
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
bad
cess
to
them
for
ever
twisted
i
was
the
way
you
d
get
a
squint
in
your
eye
if
you
only
looked
at
me
and
the
pain
i
suffered
would
astonish
it
would
not
said
the
philosopher
no
matter
said
meehawl
what
i
came
about
was
my
young
daughter
caitilin
sight
or
light
of
her
i
haven
t
had
for
three
days
my
wife
said
first
that
it
was
the
fairies
had
taken
her
and
then
she
said
it
was
a
travelling
man
that
had
a
musical
instrument
she
went
away
with
and
after
that
she
said
that
maybe
the
girl
was
lying
dead
in
the
butt
of
a
ditch
with
her
eyes
wide
open
and
she
staring
broadly
at
the
moon
in
the
night
time
and
the
sun
in
the
day
until
the
crows
would
be
finding
her
the
philosopher
drew
his
chair
closer
to
meehawl
daughters
said
he
have
been
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
their
parents
ever
since
they
were
instituted
the
flightiness
of
the
female
temperament
is
very
evident
in
those
who
have
not
arrived
at
the
years
which
teach
how
to
hide
faults
and
frailties
and
therefore
indiscretions
bristle
from
a
young
girl
the
way
branches
do
from
a
the
person
who
would
deny
that
said
meehawl
female
children
however
have
the
particular
sanction
of
nature
they
are
produced
in
astonishing
excess
over
males
and
may
accordingly
be
admitted
as
dominant
to
the
male
but
the
law
that
the
minority
shall
always
control
the
majority
will
relieve
our
minds
from
a
fear
which
might
otherwise
become
it
s
true
enough
said
meehawl
have
you
noticed
sir
that
in
a
litter
of
pups
i
have
not
said
the
philosopher
certain
trades
and
professions
it
is
curious
to
note
tend
to
be
perpetuated
in
the
female
line
the
sovereign
profession
among
bees
and
ants
is
always
female
and
publicans
also
descend
on
the
distaff
side
you
will
have
noticed
that
every
publican
has
three
daughters
of
extraordinary
charms
lacking
these
signs
we
would
do
well
to
look
askance
at
such
a
man
s
liquor
divining
that
in
his
brew
there
will
be
an
undue
percentage
of
water
for
if
his
primogeniture
is
infected
how
shall
his
honesty
escape
it
would
take
a
wise
head
to
answer
that
said
meehawl
it
would
not
said
the
philosopher
throughout
nature
the
female
tends
to
if
said
meehawl
that
unfortunate
daughter
of
mine
is
lying
dead
in
a
ditch
it
doesn
t
matter
said
the
philosopher
many
races
have
endeavoured
to
place
some
limits
to
this
increase
in
females
certain
oriental
peoples
have
conferred
the
titles
of
divinity
on
crocodiles
serpents
and
tigers
of
the
jungle
and
have
fed
these
with
their
surplusage
of
daughters
in
china
likewise
such
sacrifices
are
defended
as
honourable
and
economic
practices
but
broadly
speaking
if
daughters
have
to
be
curtailed
i
prefer
your
method
of
losing
them
rather
than
the
compromises
of
the
i
give
you
my
word
sir
said
meehawl
that
i
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
at
that
said
the
philosopher
may
be
accounted
for
in
three
ways
firstly
there
is
a
lack
of
cerebral
continuity
that
is
faulty
attention
secondly
it
might
be
due
to
a
local
peculiarity
in
the
conformation
of
the
skull
or
perhaps
a
superficial
instead
of
a
deep
indenting
of
the
cerebral
coil
and
thirdly
did
you
ever
hear
said
meehawl
of
the
man
that
had
the
scalp
of
his
head
blown
off
by
a
gun
and
they
soldered
the
bottom
of
a
tin
dish
to
the
top
of
his
skull
the
way
you
could
hear
his
brains
ticking
inside
of
it
for
all
the
world
like
a
waterbury
watch
i
did
not
said
the
philosopher
thirdly
it
may
it
s
my
daughter
caitilin
sir
said
meehawl
humbly
maybe
she
is
lying
in
the
butt
of
a
ditch
and
the
crows
picking
her
eyes
what
did
she
die
of
said
the
philosopher
my
wife
only
put
it
that
maybe
she
was
dead
and
that
maybe
she
was
taken
by
the
fairies
and
that
maybe
she
went
away
with
the
travelling
man
that
had
the
musical
instrument
she
said
it
was
a
concertina
but
i
think
myself
it
was
a
flute
he
who
was
this
traveller
i
never
saw
him
said
meehawl
but
one
day
i
went
a
few
perches
up
the
hill
and
i
heard
him
playing
thin
squeaky
music
it
was
like
you
d
be
blowing
out
of
a
tin
whistle
i
looked
about
for
him
everywhere
but
not
a
bit
of
him
could
i
eh
said
the
philosopher
i
looked
about
said
meehawl
i
know
said
the
philosopher
did
you
happen
to
look
at
your
goats
i
couldn
t
well
help
doing
that
said
meehawl
what
were
they
doing
said
the
philosopher
eagerly
they
were
bucking
each
other
across
the
field
and
standing
on
their
hind
legs
and
cutting
such
capers
that
i
laughed
till
i
had
a
pain
in
my
stomach
at
the
gait
of
this
is
very
interesting
said
the
philosopher
do
you
tell
me
so
said
meehawl
i
do
said
the
philosopher
and
for
this
of
the
races
of
the
world
have
at
one
time
or
another
it
s
my
little
daughter
caitilin
sir
said
meehawl
i
m
attending
to
her
the
philosopher
replied
i
thank
you
kindly
returned
meehawl
the
philosopher
continued
most
of
the
races
of
the
world
have
at
one
time
or
another
been
visited
by
this
deity
whose
title
is
the
great
god
pan
but
there
is
no
record
of
his
ever
having
journeyed
to
ireland
and
certainly
within
historic
times
he
has
not
set
foot
on
these
shores
he
lived
for
a
great
number
of
years
in
egypt
persia
and
greece
and
although
his
empire
is
supposed
to
be
this
universal
sway
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
contested
but
nevertheless
however
sharply
his
empire
may
be
curtailed
he
will
never
be
without
a
kingdom
wherein
his
exercise
of
sovereign
rights
will
be
gladly
and
passionately
is
he
one
of
the
old
gods
sir
said
meehawl
he
is
replied
the
philosopher
and
his
coming
intends
no
good
to
this
country
have
you
any
idea
why
he
should
have
captured
your
daughter
not
an
idea
in
the
is
your
daughter
beautiful
i
couldn
t
tell
you
because
i
never
thought
of
looking
at
her
that
way
but
she
is
a
good
milker
and
as
strong
as
a
man
she
can
lift
a
bag
of
meal
under
her
arm
easier
than
i
can
but
she
s
a
timid
creature
for
all
whatever
the
reason
is
i
am
certain
that
he
has
the
girl
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
was
directed
to
her
by
the
leprecauns
of
the
gort
you
know
they
are
at
feud
with
you
ever
since
their
bird
was
killed
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
it
and
they
racking
me
day
and
night
with
you
may
be
sure
said
the
philosopher
that
if
he
s
anywhere
at
all
it
s
at
gort
na
cloca
mora
he
is
for
being
a
stranger
he
wouldn
t
know
where
to
go
unless
he
was
directed
and
they
know
every
hole
and
corner
of
this
countryside
since
ancient
times
i
d
go
up
myself
and
have
a
talk
with
him
but
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bit
of
good
and
it
wouldn
t
be
any
use
your
going
either
he
has
power
over
all
grown
people
so
that
they
either
go
and
get
drunk
or
else
they
fall
in
love
with
every
person
they
meet
and
commit
assaults
and
things
i
wouldn
t
like
to
be
telling
you
about
the
only
folk
who
can
go
near
him
at
all
are
little
children
because
he
has
no
power
over
them
until
they
grow
to
the
sensual
age
and
then
he
exercises
lordship
over
them
as
over
every
one
else
i
ll
send
my
two
children
with
a
message
to
him
to
say
that
he
isn
t
doing
the
decent
thing
and
that
if
he
doesn
t
let
the
girl
alone
and
go
back
to
his
own
country
we
ll
send
for
angus
he
d
make
short
work
of
him
i
m
he
might
surely
but
he
may
take
the
girl
for
himself
all
the
well
i
d
sooner
he
had
her
than
the
other
one
for
he
s
one
of
ourselves
anyhow
and
the
devil
you
know
is
better
than
the
devil
you
don
t
angus
og
is
a
god
said
the
philosopher
severely
i
know
that
sir
replied
meehawl
it
s
only
a
way
of
talking
i
have
but
how
will
your
honour
get
at
angus
for
i
heard
say
that
he
hadn
t
been
seen
for
a
hundred
years
except
one
night
only
when
he
talked
to
a
man
for
half
an
hour
on
i
ll
find
him
sure
enough
replied
the
philosopher
i
ll
warrant
you
will
replied
meehawl
heartily
as
he
stood
up
long
life
and
good
health
to
your
honour
said
he
as
he
turned
away
the
philosopher
lit
his
pipe
we
live
as
long
as
we
are
let
said
he
and
we
get
the
health
we
deserve
your
salutation
embodies
a
reflection
on
death
which
is
not
philosophic
we
must
acquiesce
in
all
logical
progressions
the
merging
of
opposites
is
completion
life
runs
to
death
as
to
its
goal
and
we
should
go
towards
that
next
stage
of
experience
either
carelessly
as
to
what
must
be
or
with
a
good
honest
curiosity
as
to
what
may
there
s
not
much
fun
in
being
dead
sir
said
meehawl
how
do
you
know
said
the
philosopher
i
know
well
enough
replied
meehawl
chapter
viii
when
the
children
leaped
into
the
hole
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
they
found
themselves
sliding
down
a
dark
narrow
slant
which
dropped
them
softly
enough
into
a
little
room
this
room
was
hollowed
out
immediately
under
the
tree
and
great
care
had
been
taken
not
to
disturb
any
of
the
roots
which
ran
here
and
there
through
the
chamber
in
the
strangest
twisted
fashion
to
get
across
such
a
place
one
had
to
walk
round
and
jump
over
and
duck
under
perpetually
some
of
the
roots
had
formed
themselves
very
conveniently
into
low
seats
and
narrow
uneven
tables
and
at
the
bottom
all
the
roots
ran
into
the
floor
and
away
again
in
the
direction
required
by
their
business
after
the
clear
air
outside
this
place
was
very
dark
to
the
children
s
eyes
so
that
they
could
not
see
anything
for
a
few
minutes
but
after
a
little
time
their
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
semiobscurity
and
they
were
able
to
see
quite
well
the
first
things
they
became
aware
of
were
six
small
men
who
were
seated
on
low
roots
they
were
all
dressed
in
tight
green
clothes
and
little
leathern
aprons
and
they
wore
tall
green
hats
which
wobbled
when
they
moved
they
were
all
busily
engaged
making
shoes
one
was
drawing
out
wax
ends
on
his
knee
another
was
softening
pieces
of
leather
in
a
bucket
of
water
another
was
polishing
the
instep
of
a
shoe
with
a
piece
of
curved
bone
another
was
paring
down
a
heel
with
a
short
knife
and
another
was
hammering
wooden
pegs
into
a
sole
he
had
all
the
pegs
in
his
mouth
which
gave
him
a
widefaced
jolly
expression
and
according
as
a
peg
was
wanted
he
blew
it
into
his
hand
and
hit
it
twice
with
his
hammer
and
then
he
blew
another
peg
and
he
always
blew
the
peg
with
the
right
end
uppermost
and
never
had
to
hit
it
more
than
twice
he
was
a
person
well
worth
watching
the
children
had
slid
down
so
unexpectedly
that
they
almost
forgot
their
good
manners
but
as
soon
as
seumas
beg
discovered
that
he
was
really
in
a
room
he
removed
his
cap
and
stood
up
god
be
with
all
here
said
he
the
leprecaun
who
had
brought
them
lifted
brigid
from
the
floor
to
which
amazement
still
constrained
her
sit
down
on
that
little
root
child
of
my
heart
said
he
and
you
can
knit
stockings
for
yes
sir
said
brigid
meekly
the
leprecaun
took
four
knitting
needles
and
a
ball
of
green
wool
from
the
top
of
a
high
horizontal
root
he
had
to
climb
over
one
go
round
three
and
climb
up
two
roots
to
get
at
it
and
he
did
this
so
easily
that
it
did
not
seem
a
bit
of
trouble
he
gave
the
needles
and
wool
to
brigid
beg
do
you
know
how
to
turn
the
heel
brigid
beg
said
he
no
sir
said
brigid
well
i
ll
show
you
how
when
you
come
to
the
other
six
leprecauns
had
ceased
work
and
were
looking
at
the
children
seumas
turned
to
them
god
bless
the
work
said
he
politely
one
of
the
leprecauns
who
had
a
grey
puckered
face
and
a
thin
fringe
of
grey
whisker
very
far
under
his
chin
then
spoke
come
over
here
seumas
beg
said
he
and
i
ll
measure
you
for
a
pair
of
shoes
put
your
foot
up
on
that
the
boy
did
so
and
the
leprecaun
took
the
measure
of
his
foot
with
a
wooden
rule
now
brigid
beg
show
me
your
foot
and
he
measured
her
also
they
ll
be
ready
for
you
in
the
do
you
never
do
anything
else
but
make
shoes
sir
said
seumas
we
do
not
replied
the
leprecaun
except
when
we
want
new
clothes
and
then
we
have
to
make
them
but
we
grudge
every
minute
spent
making
anything
else
except
shoes
because
that
is
the
proper
work
for
a
leprecaun
in
the
night
time
we
go
about
the
country
into
people
s
houses
and
we
clip
little
pieces
off
their
money
and
so
bit
by
bit
we
get
a
crock
of
gold
together
because
do
you
see
a
leprecaun
has
to
have
a
crock
of
gold
so
that
if
he
s
captured
by
men
folk
he
may
be
able
to
ransom
himself
but
that
seldom
happens
because
it
s
a
great
disgrace
altogether
to
be
captured
by
a
man
and
we
ve
practiced
so
long
dodging
among
the
roots
here
that
we
can
easily
get
away
from
them
of
course
now
and
again
we
are
caught
but
men
are
fools
and
we
always
escape
without
having
to
pay
the
ransom
at
all
we
wear
green
clothes
because
it
s
the
colour
of
the
grass
and
the
leaves
and
when
we
sit
down
under
a
bush
or
lie
in
the
grass
they
just
walk
by
without
noticing
will
you
let
me
see
your
crock
of
gold
said
seumas
the
leprecaun
looked
at
him
fixedly
for
a
moment
do
you
like
griddle
bread
and
milk
said
he
i
like
it
well
seumas
answered
then
you
had
better
have
some
and
the
leprecaun
took
a
piece
of
griddle
bread
from
the
shelf
and
filled
two
saucers
with
milk
while
the
children
were
eating
the
leprecauns
asked
them
many
questions
what
time
do
you
get
up
in
the
morning
seven
o
clock
replied
seumas
and
what
do
you
have
for
breakfast
stirabout
and
milk
he
replied
it
s
good
food
said
the
leprecaun
what
do
you
have
for
dinner
potatoes
and
milk
said
seumas
it
s
not
bad
at
all
said
the
leprecaun
and
what
do
you
have
for
supper
brigid
answered
this
time
because
her
brother
s
mouth
was
full
bread
and
milk
sir
said
she
there
s
nothing
better
said
the
leprecaun
and
then
we
go
to
bed
continued
brigid
why
wouldn
t
you
said
the
leprecaun
it
was
at
this
point
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
knocked
on
the
tree
trunk
and
demanded
that
the
children
should
be
returned
to
her
when
she
had
gone
away
the
leprecauns
held
a
consultation
whereat
it
was
decided
that
they
could
not
afford
to
anger
the
thin
woman
and
the
shee
of
croghan
conghaile
so
they
shook
hands
with
the
children
and
bade
them
the
leprecaun
who
had
enticed
them
away
from
home
brought
them
back
again
and
on
parting
he
begged
the
children
to
visit
gort
na
cloca
mora
whenever
they
felt
inclined
there
s
always
a
bit
of
griddle
bread
or
potato
cake
and
a
noggin
of
milk
for
a
friend
said
he
you
are
very
kind
sir
replied
seumas
and
his
sister
said
the
same
words
as
the
leprecaun
walked
away
they
stood
watching
him
do
you
remember
said
seumas
the
way
he
hopped
and
waggled
his
leg
the
last
time
he
was
here
i
do
so
replied
brigid
well
he
isn
t
hopping
or
doing
anything
at
all
this
time
said
seumas
he
s
not
in
good
humour
said
brigid
but
i
like
so
do
i
said
seumas
when
they
went
into
the
house
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
was
very
glad
to
see
them
and
she
baked
a
cake
with
currants
in
it
and
also
gave
them
both
and
potatoes
but
the
philosopher
did
not
notice
that
they
had
been
away
at
all
he
said
at
last
that
talking
was
bad
wit
that
women
were
always
making
a
fuss
that
children
should
be
fed
but
not
fattened
and
that
beds
were
meant
to
be
slept
the
thin
woman
replied
that
he
was
a
grisly
old
man
without
bowels
that
she
did
not
know
what
she
had
married
him
for
that
he
was
three
times
her
age
and
that
no
one
would
believe
what
she
had
to
put
up
chapter
ix
pursuant
to
his
arrangement
with
meehawl
macmurrachu
the
philosopher
sent
the
children
in
search
of
pan
he
gave
them
the
fullest
instructions
as
to
how
they
should
address
the
sylvan
deity
and
then
having
received
the
admonishments
of
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
the
children
departed
in
the
early
morning
when
they
reached
the
clearing
in
the
pine
wood
through
which
the
sun
was
blazing
they
sat
down
for
a
little
while
to
rest
in
the
heat
birds
were
continually
darting
down
this
leafy
shaft
and
diving
away
into
the
dark
wood
these
birds
always
had
something
in
their
beaks
one
would
have
a
worm
or
a
snail
or
a
grasshopper
or
a
little
piece
of
wool
torn
off
a
sheep
or
a
scrap
of
cloth
or
a
piece
of
hay
and
when
they
had
put
these
things
in
a
certain
place
they
flew
up
the
again
and
looked
for
something
else
to
bring
home
on
seeing
the
children
each
of
the
birds
waggled
his
wings
and
made
a
particular
sound
they
said
caw
and
chip
and
twit
and
tut
and
what
and
pit
and
one
whom
the
youngsters
liked
very
much
always
said
the
children
were
fond
of
him
because
he
was
so
they
never
knew
where
he
was
going
to
fly
next
and
they
did
not
believe
he
knew
himself
he
would
fly
backwards
and
forwards
and
up
and
down
and
sideways
and
bawways
all
so
to
speak
in
the
one
breath
he
did
this
because
he
was
curious
to
see
what
was
happening
everywhere
and
as
something
is
always
happening
everywhere
he
was
never
able
to
fly
in
a
straight
line
for
more
than
the
littlest
distance
he
was
a
cowardly
bird
too
and
continually
fancied
that
some
person
was
going
to
throw
a
stone
at
him
from
behind
a
bush
or
a
wall
or
a
tree
and
these
imaginary
dangers
tended
to
make
his
journeyings
still
more
wayward
and
erratic
he
never
flew
where
he
wanted
to
go
himself
but
only
where
god
directed
him
and
so
he
did
not
fare
at
all
badly
the
children
knew
each
of
the
birds
by
their
sounds
and
always
said
these
words
to
them
when
they
came
near
for
a
little
time
they
had
difficulty
in
saying
the
right
word
to
the
right
bird
and
sometimes
said
chip
when
the
salutation
should
have
been
the
birds
always
resented
this
and
would
scold
them
angrily
but
after
a
little
practice
they
never
made
any
mistakes
at
all
there
was
one
bird
a
big
black
fellow
who
loved
to
be
talked
to
he
used
to
sit
on
the
ground
beside
the
children
and
say
caw
as
long
as
they
would
repeat
it
after
him
he
often
wasted
a
whole
morning
in
talk
but
none
of
the
other
birds
remained
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
they
were
always
busy
in
the
morning
but
in
the
evening
they
had
more
leisure
and
would
stay
and
chat
as
long
as
the
children
wanted
them
the
awkward
thing
was
that
in
the
evening
all
the
birds
wanted
to
talk
at
the
same
moment
so
that
the
youngsters
never
knew
which
of
them
to
answer
seumas
beg
got
out
of
that
difficulty
for
a
while
by
learning
to
whistle
their
notes
but
even
so
they
spoke
with
such
rapidity
that
he
could
not
by
any
means
keep
pace
with
them
brigid
could
only
whistle
one
note
it
was
a
little
flat
whoo
sound
which
the
birds
all
laughed
at
and
after
a
few
trials
she
refused
to
whistle
any
more
while
they
were
sitting
two
rabbits
came
to
play
about
in
the
brush
they
ran
round
and
round
in
a
circle
and
all
their
movements
were
very
quick
and
twisty
sometimes
they
jumped
over
each
other
six
or
seven
times
in
succession
and
every
now
and
then
they
sat
upright
on
their
hind
legs
and
washed
their
faces
with
their
paws
at
other
times
they
picked
up
a
blade
of
grass
which
they
ate
with
great
deliberation
pretending
all
the
time
that
it
was
a
complicated
banquet
of
cabbage
leaves
and
lettuce
while
the
children
were
playing
with
the
rabbits
an
ancient
stalwart
came
prancing
through
the
bracken
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
theirs
and
he
enjoyed
lying
beside
them
to
have
his
forehead
scratched
with
a
piece
of
sharp
stick
his
forehead
was
hard
as
rock
and
the
hair
grew
there
as
sparse
as
grass
does
on
a
wall
or
rather
the
way
moss
grows
on
a
wall
it
was
a
mat
instead
of
a
crop
his
horns
were
long
and
very
sharp
and
brilliantly
polished
on
this
day
the
had
two
chains
around
his
neck
one
was
made
of
and
the
other
was
made
of
daisies
and
the
children
wondered
to
each
other
who
it
was
could
have
woven
these
so
carefully
they
asked
the
this
question
but
he
only
looked
at
them
and
did
not
say
a
word
the
children
liked
examining
this
goat
s
eyes
they
were
very
big
and
of
the
queerest
colour
they
had
a
strange
steadfast
look
and
had
also
at
times
a
look
of
queer
deep
intelligence
and
at
other
times
they
had
a
fatherly
and
benevolent
expression
and
at
other
times
again
especially
when
he
looked
sidewards
they
had
a
mischievous
daring
mocking
inviting
and
terrifying
look
but
he
always
looked
brave
and
unconcerned
when
the
s
forehead
had
been
scratched
as
much
as
he
desired
he
arose
from
between
the
children
and
went
pacing
away
lightly
through
the
wood
the
children
ran
after
him
and
each
caught
hold
of
one
of
his
horns
and
he
ambled
and
reared
between
them
while
they
danced
along
on
his
either
side
singing
snatches
of
bird
songs
and
scraps
of
old
tunes
which
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
had
learned
among
the
people
of
the
shee
in
a
little
time
they
came
to
gort
na
cloca
mora
but
here
the
did
not
stop
they
went
past
the
big
tree
of
the
leprecauns
through
a
broken
part
of
the
hedge
and
into
another
rough
field
the
sun
was
shining
gloriously
there
was
scarcely
a
wind
at
all
to
stir
the
harsh
grasses
far
and
near
was
silence
and
warmth
an
immense
cheerful
peace
across
the
sky
a
few
light
clouds
sailed
gently
on
a
blue
so
vast
that
the
eye
failed
before
that
horizon
a
few
bees
sounded
their
deep
chant
and
now
and
again
a
wasp
rasped
hastily
on
his
journey
than
these
there
was
no
sound
of
any
kind
so
peaceful
innocent
and
safe
did
everything
appear
that
it
might
have
been
the
childhood
of
the
world
as
it
was
of
the
morning
the
children
still
clinging
to
the
friendly
goat
came
near
the
edge
of
the
field
which
here
sloped
more
steeply
to
the
mountain
top
great
boulders
slightly
covered
with
lichen
and
moss
were
strewn
about
and
around
them
the
bracken
and
gorse
were
growing
and
in
every
crevice
of
these
rocks
there
were
plants
whose
little
roots
gripped
a
desperate
adventurous
habitation
in
a
soil
scarcely
more
than
half
an
inch
deep
at
some
time
these
rocks
had
been
smitten
so
fiercely
that
the
solid
granite
surfaces
had
shattered
into
fragments
at
one
place
a
sheer
wall
of
stone
ragged
and
battered
looked
harshly
out
from
the
thin
vegetation
to
this
rocky
wall
the
danced
at
one
place
there
was
a
hole
in
the
wall
covered
by
a
thick
brush
the
goat
pushed
his
way
behind
this
growth
and
disappeared
then
the
children
curious
to
see
where
he
had
gone
pushed
through
also
behind
the
bush
they
found
a
high
narrow
opening
and
when
they
had
rubbed
their
legs
which
smarted
from
the
stings
of
nettles
thistles
and
gorse
prickles
they
went
into
the
hole
which
they
thought
was
a
place
the
goat
had
for
sleeping
in
on
cold
wet
nights
after
a
few
paces
they
found
the
passage
was
quite
comfortably
big
and
then
they
saw
a
light
and
in
another
moment
they
were
blinking
at
the
god
pan
and
caitilin
ni
murrachu
caitilin
knew
them
at
once
and
came
forward
with
welcome
o
seumas
beg
she
cried
reproachfully
how
dirty
you
have
let
your
feet
get
why
don
t
you
walk
in
the
grassy
places
and
you
brigid
have
a
right
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
to
have
your
hands
the
way
they
are
come
over
here
at
every
child
knows
that
every
grown
female
person
in
the
world
has
authority
to
wash
children
and
to
give
them
food
that
is
what
grown
people
were
made
for
consequently
seumas
and
brigid
beg
submitted
to
the
scouring
for
which
caitilin
made
instant
preparation
when
they
were
cleaned
she
pointed
to
a
couple
of
flat
stones
against
the
wall
of
the
cave
and
bade
them
sit
down
and
be
good
and
this
the
children
did
fixing
their
eyes
on
pan
with
the
cheerful
gravity
and
curiosity
which
youngsters
always
give
to
a
stranger
pan
who
had
been
lying
on
a
couch
of
dried
grass
sat
up
and
bent
an
equally
cheerful
regard
on
the
children
shepherd
girl
said
he
who
are
those
children
they
are
the
children
of
the
philosophers
of
coilla
doraca
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
and
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
are
their
mothers
and
they
are
decent
poor
children
god
bless
what
have
they
come
here
for
you
will
have
to
ask
themselves
pan
looked
at
them
smilingly
what
have
you
come
here
for
little
children
said
he
the
children
questioned
one
another
with
their
eyes
to
see
which
of
them
would
reply
and
then
seumas
beg
answered
my
father
sent
me
to
see
you
sir
and
to
say
that
you
were
not
doing
a
good
thing
in
keeping
caitilin
ni
murrachu
away
from
her
own
brigid
beg
turned
to
your
father
came
to
see
our
father
and
he
said
that
he
didn
t
know
what
had
become
of
you
at
all
and
that
maybe
you
were
lying
flat
in
a
ditch
with
the
black
crows
picking
at
your
and
what
said
pan
did
your
father
say
to
that
he
told
us
to
come
and
ask
her
to
go
do
you
love
your
father
little
child
said
pan
brigid
beg
thought
for
a
moment
i
don
t
know
sir
she
replied
he
doesn
t
mind
us
at
all
broke
in
seumas
beg
and
so
we
don
t
know
whether
we
love
him
or
i
like
caitilin
said
brigid
and
i
like
so
do
i
said
seumas
i
like
you
also
little
children
said
pan
come
over
here
and
sit
beside
me
and
we
will
so
the
two
children
went
over
to
pan
and
sat
down
one
each
side
of
him
and
he
put
his
arms
about
them
daughter
of
murrachu
said
he
is
there
no
food
in
the
house
for
guests
there
is
a
cake
of
bread
a
little
goat
s
milk
and
some
cheese
she
replied
and
she
set
about
getting
these
things
i
never
ate
cheese
said
seumas
is
it
good
surely
it
is
replied
pan
the
cheese
that
is
made
from
goat
s
milk
is
rather
strong
and
it
is
good
to
be
eaten
by
people
who
live
in
the
open
air
but
not
by
those
who
live
in
houses
for
such
people
do
not
have
any
appetite
they
are
poor
creatures
whom
i
do
not
i
like
eating
said
seumas
so
do
i
said
pan
all
good
people
like
eating
every
person
who
is
hungry
is
a
good
person
and
every
person
who
is
not
hungry
is
a
bad
person
it
is
better
to
be
hungry
than
caitilin
having
supplied
the
children
with
food
seated
herself
in
front
of
them
i
don
t
think
that
is
right
said
she
i
have
always
been
hungry
and
it
was
never
if
you
had
always
been
full
you
would
like
it
even
less
he
replied
because
when
you
are
hungry
you
are
alive
and
when
you
are
not
hungry
you
are
only
half
one
has
to
be
poor
to
be
hungry
replied
caitilin
my
father
is
poor
and
gets
no
good
of
it
but
to
work
from
morning
to
night
and
never
to
stop
doing
it
is
bad
for
a
wise
person
to
be
poor
said
pan
and
it
is
bad
for
a
fool
to
be
rich
a
rich
fool
will
think
of
nothing
else
at
first
but
to
find
a
dark
house
wherein
to
hide
away
and
there
he
will
satisfy
his
hunger
and
he
will
continue
to
do
that
until
his
hunger
is
dead
and
he
is
no
better
than
dead
but
a
wise
person
who
is
rich
will
carefully
preserve
his
appetite
all
people
who
have
been
rich
for
a
long
time
or
who
are
rich
from
birth
live
a
great
deal
outside
of
their
houses
and
so
they
are
always
hungry
and
poor
people
have
no
time
to
be
wise
said
caitilin
they
have
time
to
be
hungry
said
pan
i
ask
no
more
of
my
father
is
very
wise
said
seumas
beg
how
do
you
know
that
little
boy
said
pan
because
he
is
always
talking
replied
seumas
do
you
always
listen
my
dear
no
sir
said
seumas
i
go
to
sleep
when
he
that
is
very
clever
of
you
said
pan
i
go
to
sleep
too
said
brigid
it
is
clever
of
you
also
my
darling
do
you
go
to
sleep
when
your
mother
talks
oh
no
she
answered
if
we
went
to
sleep
then
our
mother
would
pinch
us
and
say
that
we
were
a
bad
i
think
your
mother
is
wise
said
pan
what
do
you
like
best
in
the
world
seumas
beg
the
boy
thought
for
a
moment
and
replied
i
don
t
know
pan
also
thought
for
a
little
time
i
don
t
know
what
i
like
best
either
said
he
what
do
you
like
best
in
the
world
shepherd
girl
caitilin
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
i
don
t
know
yet
she
answered
slowly
may
the
gods
keep
you
safe
from
that
knowledge
said
pan
gravely
why
would
you
say
that
she
replied
one
must
find
out
all
things
and
when
we
find
out
a
thing
we
know
if
it
is
good
or
that
is
the
beginning
of
knowledge
said
pan
but
it
is
not
the
beginning
of
what
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
it
is
carelessness
replied
pan
and
what
is
the
end
of
wisdom
said
she
i
do
not
know
he
answered
after
a
little
pause
is
it
greater
carelessness
she
enquired
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
said
he
sharply
i
am
tired
of
talking
and
so
saying
he
turned
his
face
away
from
them
and
lay
down
on
the
couch
caitilin
in
great
concern
hurried
the
children
to
the
door
of
the
cave
and
kissed
them
pan
is
sick
said
the
boy
gravely
i
hope
he
will
be
well
soon
again
the
girl
murmured
yes
yes
said
caitilin
and
she
ran
back
quickly
to
her
lord
book
ii
the
philosopher
s
journey
chapter
x
when
the
children
reached
home
they
told
the
result
of
their
visit
he
questioned
them
minutely
as
to
the
appearance
of
pan
how
he
had
received
them
and
what
he
had
said
in
defence
of
his
iniquities
but
when
he
found
that
pan
had
not
returned
any
answer
to
his
message
he
became
very
angry
he
tried
to
persuade
his
wife
to
undertake
another
embassy
setting
forth
his
abhorrence
and
defiance
of
the
god
but
the
thin
woman
replied
sourly
that
she
was
a
respectable
married
woman
that
having
been
already
bereaved
of
her
wisdom
she
had
no
desire
to
be
further
curtailed
of
her
virtue
that
a
husband
would
go
any
length
to
asperse
his
wife
s
reputation
and
that
although
she
was
married
to
a
fool
her
had
survived
even
that
calamity
the
philosopher
pointed
out
that
her
age
her
appearance
and
her
tongue
were
sufficient
guarantees
of
immunity
against
the
machinations
of
either
pan
or
slander
and
that
he
had
no
personal
feelings
in
the
matter
beyond
a
scientific
and
benevolent
interest
in
the
troubles
of
meehawl
macmurrachu
but
this
was
discounted
by
his
wife
as
the
malignant
and
subtle
tactics
customary
to
all
husbands
matters
appeared
to
be
thus
at
a
deadlock
so
far
as
they
were
immediately
concerned
and
the
philosopher
decided
that
he
would
lay
the
case
before
angus
og
and
implore
his
protection
and
assistance
on
behalf
of
the
clann
macmurrachu
he
therefore
directed
the
thin
woman
to
bake
him
two
cakes
of
bread
and
set
about
preparations
for
a
journey
the
thin
woman
baked
the
cakes
and
put
them
in
a
bag
and
early
on
the
following
morning
the
philosopher
swung
this
bag
over
his
shoulder
and
went
forth
on
his
quest
when
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
pine
wood
he
halted
for
a
few
moments
not
being
quite
certain
of
his
bearings
and
then
went
forward
again
in
the
direction
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
it
came
into
his
mind
as
he
crossed
the
gort
that
he
ought
to
call
on
the
leprecauns
and
have
a
talk
with
them
but
a
remembrance
of
meehawl
macmurrachu
and
the
troubles
under
which
he
laboured
all
directly
to
be
traced
to
the
leprecauns
hardened
his
heart
against
his
neighbours
so
that
he
passed
by
the
yew
tree
without
any
stay
in
a
short
time
he
came
to
the
rough
field
wherein
the
children
had
found
pan
and
as
he
was
proceeding
up
the
hill
he
saw
caitilin
ni
murrachu
walking
a
little
way
in
front
with
a
small
vessel
in
her
hand
the
which
she
had
just
milked
was
bending
again
to
the
herbage
and
as
caitilin
trod
lightly
in
front
of
him
the
philosopher
closed
his
eyes
in
virtuous
anger
and
opened
them
again
in
a
not
unnatural
curiosity
for
the
girl
had
no
clothes
on
he
watched
her
going
behind
the
brush
and
disappearing
in
the
cleft
of
the
rock
and
his
anger
both
with
her
and
pan
mastering
him
he
forsook
the
path
of
prudence
which
soared
to
the
mountain
top
and
followed
that
leading
to
the
cave
the
sound
of
his
feet
brought
caitilin
out
hastily
but
he
pushed
her
by
with
a
harsh
word
hussy
said
he
and
he
went
into
the
cave
where
pan
was
as
he
went
in
he
already
repented
of
his
harshness
and
said
the
human
body
is
an
aggregation
of
flesh
and
sinew
around
a
central
bony
structure
the
use
of
clothing
is
primarily
to
protect
this
organism
from
rain
and
cold
and
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
the
banner
of
morality
without
danger
to
this
fundamental
premise
if
a
person
does
not
desire
to
be
so
protected
who
will
quarrel
with
an
honourable
liberty
decency
is
not
clothing
but
mind
morality
is
behaviour
virtue
is
thought
i
have
often
fancied
he
continued
to
pan
whom
he
was
now
confronting
that
the
effect
of
clothing
on
mind
must
be
very
considerable
and
that
it
must
have
a
modifying
rather
than
an
expanding
effect
or
even
an
intensifying
as
against
an
exuberant
effect
with
clothing
the
whole
environment
is
immediately
affected
the
air
which
is
our
proper
medium
is
only
filtered
to
our
bodies
in
an
abated
and
niggardly
fashion
which
can
scarcely
be
as
beneficial
as
the
generous
and
unintermitted
elemental
play
the
question
naturally
arises
whether
clothing
is
as
unknown
to
nature
as
we
have
fancied
viewed
as
a
protective
measure
against
atmospheric
rigour
we
find
that
many
creatures
grow
by
their
own
central
impulse
some
kind
of
exterior
panoply
which
may
be
regarded
as
their
proper
clothing
bears
cats
dogs
mice
sheep
and
beavers
are
wrapped
in
fur
hair
fell
fleece
or
pelt
so
these
creatures
can
not
by
any
means
be
regarded
as
being
naked
crabs
cockroaches
snails
and
cockles
have
ordered
around
them
a
crusty
habiliment
wherein
their
original
nakedness
is
only
to
be
discovered
by
force
and
other
creatures
have
similarly
provided
themselves
with
some
species
of
covering
clothing
therefore
is
not
an
art
but
an
instinct
and
the
fact
that
man
is
born
naked
and
does
not
grow
his
clothing
upon
himself
from
within
but
collects
it
from
various
distant
and
haphazard
sources
is
not
any
reason
to
call
this
necessity
an
instinct
for
decency
these
you
will
admit
are
weighty
reflections
and
worthy
of
consideration
before
we
proceed
to
the
wide
and
thorny
subject
of
moral
and
immoral
action
now
what
is
virtue
pan
who
had
listened
with
great
courtesy
to
these
remarks
here
broke
in
on
the
philosopher
virtue
said
he
is
the
performance
of
pleasant
the
philosopher
held
the
statement
for
a
moment
on
his
forefinger
and
what
then
is
vice
said
he
it
is
vicious
said
pan
to
neglect
the
performance
of
pleasant
if
this
be
so
the
other
commented
philosophy
has
up
to
the
present
been
on
the
wrong
that
is
so
said
pan
philosophy
is
an
immoral
practice
because
it
suggests
a
standard
of
practice
impossible
of
being
followed
and
which
if
it
could
be
followed
would
lead
to
the
great
sin
of
the
idea
of
virtue
said
the
philosopher
with
some
indignation
has
animated
the
noblest
intellects
of
the
it
has
not
animated
them
replied
pan
it
has
hypnotised
them
so
that
they
have
conceived
virtue
as
repression
and
as
an
honourable
thing
instead
of
the
suicide
which
it
indeed
said
the
philosopher
this
is
very
interesting
and
if
it
is
true
the
whole
conduct
of
life
will
have
to
be
very
much
life
is
already
very
simple
said
pan
it
is
to
be
born
and
to
die
and
in
the
interval
to
eat
and
drink
to
dance
and
sing
to
marry
and
beget
but
it
is
simply
materialism
cried
the
philosopher
why
do
you
say
but
replied
pan
it
is
sheer
unredeemed
animalism
continued
his
visitor
it
is
any
name
you
please
to
call
it
replied
pan
you
have
proved
nothing
the
philosopher
shouted
what
can
be
sensed
requires
no
you
leave
out
the
new
thing
said
the
philosopher
you
leave
out
brains
i
believe
in
mind
above
matter
thought
above
emotion
spirit
above
of
course
you
do
said
pan
and
he
reached
for
his
oaten
pipe
the
philosopher
ran
to
the
opening
of
the
passage
and
thrust
caitilin
aside
hussy
said
he
fiercely
to
her
and
he
darted
out
as
he
went
up
the
rugged
path
he
could
hear
the
pipes
of
pan
calling
and
sobbing
and
making
high
merriment
on
the
air
chapter
xi
she
does
not
deserve
to
be
rescued
said
the
philosopher
but
i
will
rescue
her
indeed
he
thought
a
moment
later
she
does
not
want
to
be
rescued
and
therefore
i
will
rescue
as
he
went
down
the
road
her
shapely
figure
floated
before
his
eyes
as
beautiful
and
simple
as
an
old
statue
he
wagged
his
head
angrily
at
the
apparition
but
it
would
not
go
away
he
tried
to
concentrate
his
mind
on
a
deep
philosophical
maxim
but
her
disturbing
image
came
between
him
and
his
thought
blotting
out
the
latter
so
completely
that
a
moment
after
he
had
stated
his
aphorism
he
could
not
remember
what
it
had
been
such
a
condition
of
mind
was
so
unusual
that
it
bewildered
him
is
a
mind
then
so
unstable
said
he
that
a
mere
figure
an
animated
geometrical
arrangement
can
shake
it
from
its
foundations
the
idea
horrified
him
he
saw
civilisation
building
its
temples
over
a
volcano
a
puff
said
he
and
it
is
gone
beneath
all
is
chaos
and
red
anarchy
over
all
a
devouring
and
insistent
appetite
our
eyes
tell
us
what
to
think
about
and
our
wisdom
is
no
more
than
a
catalogue
of
sensual
he
would
have
been
in
a
state
of
deep
dejection
were
it
not
that
through
his
perturbation
there
bubbled
a
stream
of
such
amazing
as
he
had
not
felt
since
childhood
years
had
toppled
from
his
shoulders
he
left
one
pound
of
solid
matter
behind
at
every
stride
his
very
skin
grew
flexuous
and
he
found
a
pleasure
in
taking
long
steps
such
as
he
could
not
have
accounted
for
by
thought
indeed
thought
was
the
one
thing
he
felt
unequal
to
and
it
was
not
precisely
that
he
could
not
think
but
that
he
did
not
want
to
all
the
importance
and
authority
of
his
mind
seemed
to
have
faded
away
and
the
activity
which
had
once
belonged
to
that
organ
was
now
transferred
to
his
eyes
he
saw
amazedly
the
sunshine
bathing
the
hills
and
the
valleys
a
bird
in
the
hedge
held
him
beak
head
eyes
legs
and
the
wings
that
tapered
widely
at
angles
to
the
wind
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
really
saw
a
bird
and
one
minute
after
it
had
flown
away
he
could
have
reproduced
its
strident
note
with
every
step
along
the
curving
road
the
landscape
was
changing
he
saw
and
noted
it
almost
in
an
ecstasy
a
sharp
hill
jutted
out
into
the
road
it
dissolved
into
a
sloping
meadow
rolled
down
into
a
valley
and
then
climbed
easily
and
peacefully
into
a
hill
again
on
this
side
a
clump
of
trees
nodded
together
in
the
friendliest
fashion
yonder
a
solitary
tree
and
clean
was
contented
with
its
own
bright
company
a
bush
crouched
tightly
on
the
ground
as
though
at
a
word
it
would
scamper
from
its
place
and
chase
rabbits
across
the
sward
with
shouts
and
laughter
great
spaces
of
sunshine
were
everywhere
and
everywhere
there
were
deep
wells
of
shadow
and
the
one
did
not
seem
more
beautiful
than
the
other
that
sunshine
oh
the
glory
of
it
the
goodness
and
bravery
of
it
how
broadly
and
grandly
it
shone
without
stint
without
care
he
saw
its
measureless
generosity
and
gloried
in
it
as
though
himself
had
been
the
flinger
of
that
largesse
and
was
he
not
did
the
sunlight
not
stream
from
his
head
and
life
from
his
surely
the
that
was
in
him
did
bubble
out
to
an
activity
beyond
the
universe
thought
oh
the
petty
thing
but
motion
emotion
these
were
the
realities
to
feel
to
do
to
stride
forward
in
elation
chanting
a
paean
of
triumphant
life
after
a
time
he
felt
hungry
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
wallet
he
broke
off
a
piece
of
one
of
his
cakes
and
looked
about
for
a
place
where
he
might
happily
eat
it
by
the
side
of
the
road
there
was
a
well
just
a
little
corner
filled
with
water
over
it
was
a
rough
stone
coping
and
around
hugging
it
on
three
sides
almost
from
sight
were
thick
quiet
bushes
he
would
not
have
noticed
the
well
at
all
but
for
a
thin
stream
the
breadth
of
two
hands
which
tiptoed
away
from
it
through
a
field
by
this
well
he
sat
down
and
scooped
the
water
in
his
hand
and
it
tasted
good
he
was
eating
his
cake
when
a
sound
touched
his
ear
from
some
distance
and
shortly
a
woman
came
down
the
path
carrying
a
vessel
in
her
hand
to
draw
water
she
was
a
big
comely
woman
and
she
walked
as
one
who
had
no
misfortunes
and
no
misgivings
when
she
saw
the
philosopher
sitting
by
the
well
she
halted
a
moment
in
surprise
and
then
came
forward
with
a
smile
good
morrow
to
you
sir
said
she
good
morrow
to
you
too
ma
am
replied
the
philosopher
sit
down
beside
me
here
and
eat
some
of
my
why
wouldn
t
i
indeed
said
the
woman
and
she
did
sit
beside
him
the
philosopher
cracked
a
large
piece
off
his
cake
and
gave
it
to
her
and
she
ate
some
there
s
a
taste
on
that
cake
said
she
who
made
it
my
wife
did
he
replied
well
now
said
she
looking
at
him
do
you
know
you
don
t
look
a
bit
like
a
married
no
said
the
philosopher
not
a
bit
a
married
man
looks
comfortable
and
settled
he
looks
finished
if
you
understand
me
and
a
bachelor
looks
unsettled
and
funny
and
he
always
wants
to
be
running
round
seeing
things
i
d
know
a
married
man
from
a
bachelor
any
how
would
you
know
that
said
the
philosopher
easily
said
she
with
a
nod
it
s
the
way
they
look
at
a
woman
a
married
man
looks
at
you
quietly
as
if
he
knew
all
about
you
there
isn
t
any
strangeness
about
him
with
a
woman
at
all
but
a
bachelor
man
looks
at
you
very
sharp
and
looks
away
and
then
looks
back
again
the
way
you
d
know
he
was
thinking
about
you
and
didn
t
know
what
you
were
thinking
about
him
and
so
they
are
always
strange
and
that
s
why
women
like
why
said
the
philosopher
astonished
do
women
like
bachelors
better
than
married
men
of
course
they
do
she
replied
heartily
they
wouldn
t
look
at
the
side
of
the
road
a
married
man
was
on
if
there
was
a
bachelor
man
on
the
other
this
said
the
philosopher
earnestly
is
very
and
the
queer
thing
is
she
continued
that
when
i
came
up
the
road
and
saw
you
i
said
to
myself
it
s
a
bachelor
how
long
have
you
been
married
now
i
don
t
know
said
the
philosopher
maybe
it
s
ten
and
how
many
children
would
you
have
mister
two
he
replied
and
then
corrected
himself
no
i
have
only
is
the
other
one
dead
i
never
had
more
than
ten
years
married
and
only
one
child
said
she
why
man
dear
you
re
not
a
married
man
what
were
you
doing
at
all
at
all
i
wouldn
t
like
to
be
telling
you
the
children
i
have
living
and
dead
but
what
i
say
is
that
married
or
not
you
re
a
bachelor
man
i
knew
it
the
minute
i
looked
at
you
what
sort
of
a
woman
is
herself
she
s
a
thin
sort
of
woman
cried
the
philosopher
biting
into
his
cake
is
she
now
and
the
philosopher
continued
the
reason
i
talked
to
you
is
because
you
are
a
fat
i
am
not
fat
was
her
angry
response
you
are
fat
insisted
the
philosopher
and
that
s
the
reason
i
like
oh
if
you
mean
it
that
way
she
chuckled
i
think
he
continued
looking
at
her
admiringly
that
women
ought
to
be
tell
you
the
truth
said
she
eagerly
i
think
that
myself
i
never
met
a
thin
woman
but
she
was
a
sour
one
and
i
never
met
a
fat
man
but
he
was
a
fool
fat
women
and
thin
men
it
s
nature
said
she
it
is
said
he
and
he
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
eye
oh
you
villain
said
the
woman
putting
out
her
hands
against
him
the
philosopher
drew
back
abashed
forgive
me
he
began
if
i
have
alarmed
your
virtue
it
s
the
married
man
s
word
said
she
rising
hastily
now
i
know
you
but
there
s
a
lot
of
the
bachelor
in
you
all
the
same
god
help
you
i
m
going
and
so
saying
she
dipped
her
vessel
in
the
well
and
turned
away
maybe
said
the
philosopher
i
ought
to
wait
until
your
husband
comes
home
and
ask
his
forgiveness
for
the
wrong
i
ve
done
the
woman
turned
round
on
him
and
each
of
her
eyes
was
as
big
as
a
plate
what
do
you
say
said
she
follow
me
if
you
dare
and
i
ll
set
the
dog
on
you
i
will
so
and
she
strode
viciously
homewards
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
the
philosopher
took
his
own
path
across
the
hill
the
day
was
now
well
advanced
and
as
he
trudged
forward
the
happy
quietude
of
his
surroundings
stole
into
his
heart
again
and
so
toned
down
his
recollection
of
the
fat
woman
that
in
a
little
time
she
was
no
more
than
a
pleasant
and
curious
memory
his
mind
was
exercised
superficially
not
in
thinking
but
in
wondering
how
it
was
he
had
come
to
kiss
a
strange
woman
he
said
to
himself
that
such
conduct
was
not
right
but
this
statement
was
no
more
than
the
automatic
working
of
a
mind
long
exercised
in
the
distinctions
of
right
and
wrong
for
almost
in
the
same
breath
he
assured
himself
that
what
he
had
done
did
not
matter
in
the
least
his
opinions
were
undergoing
a
curious
change
right
and
wrong
were
meeting
and
blending
together
so
closely
that
it
became
difficult
to
dissever
them
and
the
obloquy
attaching
to
the
one
seemed
out
of
proportion
altogether
to
its
importance
while
the
other
by
no
means
justified
the
eulogy
wherewith
it
was
connected
was
there
any
immediate
or
even
distant
effect
on
life
caused
by
evil
which
was
not
instantly
swung
into
equipoise
by
goodness
but
these
slender
reflections
troubled
him
only
for
a
little
time
he
had
little
desire
for
any
introspective
quarryings
to
feel
so
well
was
sufficient
in
itself
why
should
thought
be
so
apparent
to
us
so
insistent
we
do
not
know
we
have
digestive
or
circulatory
organs
until
these
go
out
of
order
and
then
the
knowledge
torments
us
should
not
the
labours
of
a
healthy
brain
be
equally
subterranean
and
equally
competent
why
have
we
to
think
aloud
and
travel
laboriously
from
syllogism
to
ergo
chary
of
our
conclusions
and
distrustful
of
our
premises
thought
as
we
know
it
is
a
disease
and
no
more
the
healthy
mentality
should
register
its
convictions
and
not
its
labours
our
ears
should
not
hear
the
clamour
of
its
doubts
nor
be
forced
to
listen
to
the
pro
and
con
wherewith
we
are
eternally
badgered
and
perplexed
the
road
was
winding
like
a
ribbon
in
and
out
of
the
mountains
on
either
side
there
were
hedges
and
bushes
little
stiff
trees
which
held
their
foliage
in
their
hands
and
dared
the
winds
snatch
a
leaf
from
that
grip
the
hills
were
swelling
and
sinking
folding
and
soaring
on
every
view
now
the
silence
was
startled
by
the
falling
tinkle
of
a
stream
far
away
a
cow
lowed
a
long
deep
monotone
or
a
goat
s
call
trembled
from
nowhere
to
nowhere
but
mostly
there
was
a
silence
which
buzzed
with
a
multitude
of
small
winged
life
going
up
the
hills
the
philosopher
bent
forward
to
the
gradient
stamping
vigorously
as
he
trod
almost
snorting
like
a
bull
in
the
pride
of
successful
energy
coming
down
the
slope
he
braced
back
and
let
his
legs
loose
to
do
as
they
pleased
didn
t
they
know
their
business
good
luck
to
them
and
away
as
he
walked
along
he
saw
an
old
woman
hobbling
in
front
of
him
she
was
leaning
on
a
stick
and
her
hand
was
red
and
swollen
with
rheumatism
she
hobbled
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
were
stones
in
her
shapeless
boots
she
was
draped
in
the
sorriest
miscellaneous
rags
that
could
be
imagined
and
these
were
knotted
together
so
intricately
that
her
clothing
having
once
been
attached
to
her
body
could
never
again
be
detached
from
it
as
she
walked
she
was
mumbling
and
grumbling
to
herself
so
that
her
mouth
moved
round
and
round
in
an
fashion
the
philosopher
soon
caught
up
on
her
good
morrow
ma
am
said
he
but
she
did
not
hear
him
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
pain
which
the
stones
in
her
boots
gave
her
good
morrow
ma
am
said
the
philosopher
again
this
time
she
heard
him
and
replied
turning
her
old
bleared
eyes
slowly
in
his
good
morrow
to
yourself
sir
said
she
and
the
philosopher
thought
her
old
face
was
a
very
kindly
one
what
is
it
that
is
wrong
with
you
ma
am
said
he
it
s
my
boots
sir
she
replied
full
of
stones
they
are
the
way
i
can
hardly
walk
at
all
god
help
me
why
don
t
you
shake
them
out
ah
sure
i
couldn
t
be
bothered
sir
for
there
are
so
many
holes
in
the
boots
that
more
would
get
in
before
i
could
take
two
steps
and
an
old
woman
can
t
be
always
fidgeting
god
help
her
there
was
a
little
house
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
when
the
old
woman
saw
this
place
she
brightened
up
a
little
do
you
know
who
lives
in
that
house
said
the
philosopher
i
do
not
she
replied
but
it
s
a
real
nice
house
with
clean
windows
and
a
shiny
knocker
on
the
door
and
smoke
in
the
chimney
i
wonder
would
herself
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
now
if
i
asked
her
a
poor
old
woman
walking
the
roads
on
a
stick
and
maybe
a
bit
of
meat
or
an
egg
perhaps
you
could
ask
suggested
the
philosopher
gently
maybe
i
will
too
said
she
and
she
sat
down
by
the
road
just
outside
the
house
and
the
philosopher
also
sat
down
a
little
puppy
dog
came
from
behind
the
house
and
approached
them
cautiously
its
intentions
were
friendly
but
it
had
already
found
that
amicable
advances
are
sometimes
indifferently
received
for
as
it
drew
near
it
wagged
its
dubious
tail
and
rolled
humbly
on
the
ground
but
very
soon
the
dog
discovered
that
here
there
was
no
evil
for
it
trotted
over
to
the
old
woman
and
without
any
more
preparation
jumped
into
her
lap
the
old
woman
grinned
at
the
dog
ah
you
thing
you
said
she
and
she
gave
it
her
finger
to
bite
the
delighted
puppy
chewed
her
bony
finger
and
then
instituted
a
mimic
warfare
against
a
piece
of
rag
that
fluttered
from
her
breast
barking
and
growling
in
joyous
excitement
while
the
old
woman
fondled
and
hugged
it
the
door
of
the
house
opposite
opened
quickly
and
a
woman
with
a
face
came
out
leave
that
dog
down
said
she
the
old
woman
grinned
humbly
at
her
sure
ma
am
i
wouldn
t
hurt
the
little
dog
the
thing
put
down
that
dog
said
the
woman
and
go
about
your
business
the
likes
of
you
ought
to
be
a
man
in
shirt
sleeves
appeared
behind
her
and
at
him
the
old
woman
grinned
even
more
humbly
let
me
sit
here
for
a
while
and
play
with
the
little
dog
sir
said
she
sure
the
roads
do
be
lonesome
the
man
stalked
close
and
grabbed
the
dog
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
it
hung
between
his
finger
and
thumb
with
its
tail
tucked
between
its
legs
and
its
eyes
screwed
round
on
one
side
in
amazement
be
off
with
you
out
of
that
you
old
strap
said
the
man
in
a
terrible
voice
so
the
old
woman
rose
painfully
to
her
feet
again
and
as
she
went
hobbling
along
the
dusty
road
she
began
to
cry
the
philosopher
also
arose
he
was
very
indignant
but
did
not
know
what
to
do
a
singular
lassitude
also
prevented
him
from
interfering
as
they
paced
along
his
companion
began
mumbling
more
to
herself
than
to
him
ah
god
be
with
me
said
she
an
old
woman
on
a
stick
that
hasn
t
a
place
in
the
wide
world
to
go
to
or
a
neighbour
itself
i
wish
i
could
get
a
cup
of
tea
so
i
do
i
wish
to
god
i
could
get
a
cup
of
tea
me
sitting
down
in
my
own
little
house
with
the
white
tablecloth
on
the
table
and
the
butter
in
the
dish
and
the
strong
red
tea
in
the
and
me
pouring
cream
into
it
and
maybe
telling
the
children
not
to
be
wasting
the
sugar
the
things
and
himself
saying
he
d
got
to
mow
the
big
field
or
that
the
red
cow
was
going
to
calve
the
poor
thing
and
that
if
the
boys
went
to
school
who
was
going
to
weed
the
turnips
and
me
sitting
drinking
my
strong
cup
of
tea
and
telling
him
where
that
old
trapesing
hen
was
laying
ah
god
be
with
me
an
old
creature
hobbling
along
the
roads
on
a
stick
i
wish
i
was
a
young
girl
again
so
i
do
and
himself
coming
courting
me
and
him
saying
that
i
was
a
real
nice
little
girl
surely
and
that
nothing
would
make
him
happy
or
easy
at
all
but
me
to
be
loving
ah
the
kind
man
that
he
was
to
be
sure
the
kind
decent
man
and
sorca
reilly
to
be
trying
to
get
him
from
me
and
kate
finnegan
with
her
bold
eyes
looking
after
him
in
the
chapel
and
him
to
be
saying
that
along
with
me
they
were
only
a
pair
of
old
nanny
goats
and
then
me
to
be
getting
married
and
going
home
to
my
own
little
house
with
my
man
ah
god
be
with
me
and
him
kissing
me
and
laughing
and
frightening
me
with
his
ah
the
kind
man
with
his
soft
eyes
and
his
nice
voice
and
his
jokes
and
laughing
and
him
thinking
the
world
and
all
of
me
ay
indeed
and
the
neighbours
to
be
coming
in
and
sitting
round
the
fire
in
the
night
time
putting
the
world
through
each
other
and
talking
about
france
and
russia
and
them
other
queer
places
and
him
holding
up
the
discourse
like
a
learned
man
and
them
all
listening
to
him
and
nodding
their
heads
at
each
other
and
wondering
at
his
education
and
all
or
maybe
the
neighbours
to
be
singing
or
him
making
me
sing
the
coulin
and
him
to
be
proud
of
me
and
then
him
to
be
killed
on
me
with
a
cold
on
his
chest
ah
then
god
be
with
me
a
lone
old
creature
on
a
stick
and
the
sun
shining
into
her
eyes
and
she
thirsty
i
wish
i
had
a
cup
of
tea
so
i
do
i
wish
to
god
i
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
bit
of
meat
or
maybe
an
egg
a
nice
fresh
egg
laid
by
the
speckeldy
hen
that
used
to
be
giving
me
all
the
trouble
the
thing
sixteen
hens
i
had
and
they
were
the
ones
for
laying
surely
it
s
the
queer
world
so
it
is
the
queer
world
and
the
things
that
do
happen
for
no
reason
at
all
ah
god
be
with
me
i
wish
there
weren
t
stones
in
my
boots
so
i
do
and
i
wish
to
god
i
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
fresh
egg
ah
glory
be
my
old
legs
are
getting
tireder
every
day
so
they
are
wisha
one
time
when
himself
was
in
it
i
could
go
about
the
house
all
day
long
cleaning
the
place
and
feeding
the
pigs
and
the
hens
and
all
and
then
dance
half
the
night
so
i
could
and
himself
proud
of
me
the
old
woman
turned
up
a
little
rambling
road
and
went
on
still
talking
to
herself
and
the
philosopher
watched
her
go
up
that
road
for
a
long
time
he
was
very
glad
she
had
gone
away
and
as
he
tramped
forward
he
banished
her
sad
image
so
that
in
a
little
time
he
was
happy
again
the
sun
was
still
shining
the
birds
were
flying
on
every
side
and
the
wide
above
him
smiled
gaily
a
small
narrow
road
cut
at
right
angles
into
his
path
and
as
he
approached
this
he
heard
the
bustle
and
movement
of
a
host
the
trample
of
feet
the
rolling
and
creaking
of
wheels
and
the
long
unwearied
drone
of
voices
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
abreast
of
this
small
road
and
saw
an
ass
and
cart
piled
with
pots
and
pans
and
walking
beside
this
there
were
two
men
and
a
woman
the
men
and
the
woman
were
talking
together
loudly
even
fiercely
and
the
ass
was
drawing
his
cart
along
the
road
without
requiring
assistance
or
direction
while
there
was
a
road
he
walked
on
it
when
he
might
come
to
a
cross
road
he
would
turn
to
the
right
when
a
man
said
whoh
he
would
stop
when
he
said
hike
he
would
go
backwards
and
when
he
said
yep
he
would
go
on
again
that
was
life
and
if
one
questioned
it
one
was
hit
with
a
stick
or
a
boot
or
a
lump
of
rock
if
one
continued
walking
nothing
happened
and
that
was
happiness
the
philosopher
saluted
this
cavalcade
god
be
with
you
said
he
god
and
mary
be
with
you
said
the
first
man
god
and
mary
and
patrick
be
with
you
said
the
second
man
god
and
mary
and
patrick
and
brigid
be
with
you
said
the
woman
the
ass
however
did
not
say
a
thing
as
the
word
whoh
had
not
entered
into
the
conversation
he
knew
it
was
none
of
his
business
and
so
he
turned
to
the
right
on
the
new
path
and
continued
his
journey
where
are
you
going
to
stranger
said
the
first
man
i
am
going
to
visit
angus
og
replied
the
philosopher
the
man
gave
him
a
quick
look
well
said
he
that
s
the
queerest
story
i
ever
heard
listen
here
he
called
to
the
others
this
man
is
looking
for
angus
the
other
man
and
woman
came
closer
what
would
you
be
wanting
with
angus
og
mister
honey
said
the
woman
oh
replied
the
philosopher
it
s
a
particular
thing
a
family
there
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
they
all
stepped
onwards
behind
the
ass
and
cart
how
do
you
know
where
to
look
for
himself
said
the
first
man
again
maybe
you
got
the
place
where
he
lives
written
down
in
an
old
book
or
on
a
carved
stone
or
did
you
find
the
staff
of
amergin
or
of
ossian
in
a
bog
and
it
written
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
with
signs
said
the
second
man
no
said
the
philosopher
it
isn
t
that
way
you
d
go
visiting
a
god
what
you
do
is
you
go
out
from
your
house
and
walk
straight
away
in
any
direction
with
your
shadow
behind
you
so
long
as
it
is
towards
a
mountain
for
the
gods
will
not
stay
in
a
valley
or
a
level
plain
but
only
in
high
places
and
then
if
the
god
wants
you
to
see
him
you
will
go
to
his
rath
as
direct
as
if
you
knew
where
it
was
for
he
will
be
leading
you
with
an
airy
thread
reaching
from
his
own
place
to
wherever
you
are
and
if
he
doesn
t
want
to
see
you
you
will
never
find
out
where
he
is
not
if
you
were
to
walk
for
a
year
or
twenty
how
do
you
know
he
wants
to
see
you
said
the
second
man
why
wouldn
t
he
want
said
the
philosopher
maybe
mister
honey
said
the
woman
you
are
a
holy
sort
of
a
man
that
a
god
would
like
why
would
i
be
that
said
the
philosopher
the
gods
like
a
man
whether
he
s
holy
or
not
if
he
s
only
ah
well
there
s
plenty
of
that
sort
said
the
first
man
what
do
you
happen
to
have
in
your
bag
stranger
nothing
replied
the
philosopher
but
a
cake
and
a
half
that
was
baked
for
my
give
me
a
bit
of
your
cake
mister
honey
said
the
woman
i
like
to
have
a
taste
of
everybody
s
i
will
and
welcome
said
the
philosopher
you
may
as
well
give
us
all
a
bit
while
you
are
about
it
said
the
second
man
that
woman
hasn
t
got
all
the
hunger
of
the
why
not
said
the
philosopher
and
he
divided
the
cake
there
s
a
sup
of
water
up
yonder
said
the
first
man
and
it
will
do
to
moisten
the
cake
whoh
you
devil
he
roared
at
the
ass
and
the
ass
stood
stock
still
on
the
minute
there
was
a
thin
fringe
of
grass
along
the
road
near
a
wall
and
towards
this
the
ass
began
to
edge
very
gently
hike
you
beast
you
shouted
the
man
and
the
ass
at
once
hiked
but
he
did
it
in
a
way
that
brought
him
close
to
the
grass
the
first
man
took
a
tin
can
out
of
the
cart
and
climbed
over
the
little
wall
for
water
before
he
went
he
gave
the
ass
three
kicks
on
the
nose
but
the
ass
did
not
say
a
word
he
only
hiked
still
more
which
brought
him
directly
on
to
the
grass
and
when
the
man
climbed
over
the
wall
the
ass
commenced
to
crop
the
grass
there
was
a
spider
sitting
on
a
hot
stone
in
the
grass
he
had
a
small
body
and
wide
legs
and
he
wasn
t
doing
anything
does
anybody
ever
kick
you
in
the
nose
said
the
ass
to
him
ay
does
there
said
the
spider
you
and
your
like
that
are
always
walking
on
me
or
lying
down
on
me
or
running
over
me
with
the
wheels
of
a
well
why
don
t
you
stay
on
the
wall
said
the
ass
sure
my
wife
is
there
replied
the
spider
what
s
the
harm
in
that
said
the
ass
she
d
eat
me
said
the
spider
and
anyhow
the
competition
on
the
wall
is
dreadful
and
the
flies
are
getting
wiser
and
timider
every
season
have
you
got
a
wife
yourself
now
i
have
not
said
the
ass
i
wish
i
you
like
your
wife
for
the
first
while
said
the
spider
and
after
that
you
hate
if
i
had
the
first
while
i
d
chance
the
second
while
replied
the
ass
it
s
bachelor
s
talk
said
the
spider
all
the
same
we
can
t
keep
away
from
them
and
so
saying
he
began
to
move
all
his
legs
at
once
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
you
can
only
die
once
said
he
if
your
wife
was
an
ass
she
wouldn
t
eat
you
said
the
ass
she
d
be
doing
something
else
then
replied
the
spider
and
he
climbed
up
the
wall
the
first
man
came
back
with
the
can
of
water
and
they
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
ate
the
cake
and
drank
the
water
all
the
time
the
woman
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
philosopher
mister
honey
said
she
i
think
you
met
us
just
at
the
right
the
other
two
men
sat
upright
and
looked
at
each
other
and
then
with
equal
intentness
they
looked
at
the
woman
why
do
you
say
that
said
the
philosopher
we
were
having
a
great
argument
along
the
road
and
if
we
were
to
be
talking
from
now
to
the
dav
of
doom
that
argument
would
never
be
it
must
have
been
a
great
argument
was
it
about
predestination
or
where
consciousness
comes
from
it
was
not
it
was
which
of
these
two
men
was
to
marry
that
s
not
a
great
argument
said
the
philosopher
isn
t
it
said
the
woman
for
seven
days
and
six
nights
we
didn
t
talk
about
anything
else
and
that
s
a
great
argument
or
i
d
like
to
know
what
but
where
is
the
trouble
ma
am
said
the
philosopher
it
s
this
she
replied
that
i
can
t
make
up
my
mind
which
of
the
men
i
ll
take
for
i
like
one
as
well
as
the
other
and
better
and
i
d
as
soon
have
one
as
the
other
and
it
s
a
hard
case
said
the
philosopher
it
is
said
the
woman
and
i
m
sick
and
sorry
with
the
trouble
of
and
why
did
you
say
that
i
had
come
up
in
a
good
minute
because
mister
honey
when
a
woman
has
two
men
to
choose
from
she
doesn
t
know
what
to
do
for
two
men
always
become
like
brothers
so
that
you
wouldn
t
know
which
of
them
was
which
there
isn
t
any
more
difference
between
two
men
than
there
is
between
a
couple
of
hares
but
when
there
s
three
men
to
choose
from
there
s
no
trouble
at
all
and
so
i
say
that
it
s
yourself
i
ll
marry
this
night
and
no
one
else
and
let
you
two
men
be
sitting
quiet
in
your
places
for
i
m
telling
you
what
i
ll
do
and
that
s
the
end
of
i
ll
give
you
my
word
said
the
first
man
that
i
m
just
as
glad
as
you
are
to
have
it
over
and
done
moidered
i
was
said
the
second
man
with
the
whole
argument
and
the
this
and
that
of
it
and
you
not
able
to
say
a
word
but
maybe
i
will
and
maybe
i
won
t
and
this
is
true
and
that
is
true
and
why
not
to
me
and
why
not
to
him
i
ll
get
a
sleep
this
the
philosopher
was
perplexed
you
can
not
marry
me
ma
am
said
he
because
i
m
married
the
woman
turned
round
on
him
angrily
don
t
be
making
any
argument
with
me
now
said
she
for
i
won
t
stand
the
first
man
looked
fiercely
at
the
philosopher
and
then
motioned
to
his
companion
give
that
man
a
clout
in
the
jaw
said
he
the
second
man
was
preparing
to
do
this
when
the
woman
intervened
angrily
keep
your
hands
to
yourself
said
she
or
it
ll
be
the
worse
for
you
i
m
well
able
to
take
care
of
my
own
husband
and
she
drew
nearer
and
sat
between
the
philosopher
and
the
men
at
that
moment
the
philosopher
s
cake
lost
all
its
savour
and
he
packed
the
remnant
into
his
wallet
they
all
sat
silently
looking
at
their
feet
and
thinking
each
one
according
to
his
nature
the
philosopher
s
mind
which
for
the
past
day
had
been
in
eclipse
stirred
faintly
to
meet
these
new
circumstances
but
without
much
result
there
was
a
flutter
at
his
heart
which
was
terrifying
but
not
unpleasant
quickening
through
his
apprehension
was
an
expectancy
which
stirred
his
pulses
into
speed
so
rapidly
did
his
blood
flow
so
quickly
were
an
hundred
impressions
visualized
and
recorded
so
violent
was
the
surface
movement
of
his
brain
that
he
did
not
realize
he
was
unable
to
think
and
that
he
was
only
seeing
and
feeling
the
first
man
stood
up
the
night
will
be
coming
on
soon
said
he
and
we
had
better
be
walking
on
if
we
want
to
get
a
good
place
to
sleep
yep
you
devil
he
roared
at
the
ass
and
the
ass
began
to
move
almost
before
he
lifted
his
head
from
the
grass
the
two
men
walked
one
on
either
side
of
the
cart
and
the
woman
and
the
philosopher
walked
behind
at
the
if
you
were
feeling
tired
or
anything
like
that
mister
honey
said
the
woman
you
could
climb
up
into
the
little
cart
and
nobody
would
say
a
word
to
you
for
i
can
see
that
you
are
not
used
to
i
am
not
indeed
ma
am
he
replied
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
came
on
a
journey
and
if
it
wasn
t
for
angus
og
i
wouldn
t
put
a
foot
out
of
my
own
place
for
put
angus
og
out
of
your
head
my
dear
she
replied
for
what
would
the
likes
of
you
and
me
be
saying
to
a
god
he
might
put
a
curse
on
us
would
sink
us
into
the
ground
or
burn
us
up
like
a
grip
of
straw
be
contented
now
i
m
saying
for
if
there
is
a
woman
in
the
world
who
knows
all
things
i
am
that
woman
myself
and
if
you
tell
your
trouble
to
me
i
ll
tell
you
the
thing
to
do
just
as
good
as
angus
himself
and
better
that
is
very
interesting
said
the
philosopher
what
kind
of
things
do
you
know
best
if
you
were
to
ask
one
of
them
two
men
walking
beside
the
ass
they
d
tell
you
plenty
of
things
they
saw
me
do
when
they
could
do
nothing
themselves
when
there
wasn
t
a
road
to
take
anywhere
i
showed
them
a
road
and
when
there
wasn
t
a
bit
of
food
in
the
world
i
gave
them
food
and
when
they
were
bet
to
the
last
i
put
shillings
in
their
hands
and
that
s
the
reason
they
wanted
to
marry
do
you
call
that
kind
of
thing
wisdom
said
the
philosopher
why
wouldn
t
i
said
she
isn
t
it
wisdom
to
go
through
the
world
without
fear
and
not
to
be
hungry
in
a
hungry
hour
i
suppose
it
is
he
replied
but
i
never
thought
of
it
that
way
and
what
would
you
call
wisdom
i
couldn
t
rightly
say
now
he
replied
but
i
think
it
was
not
to
mind
about
the
world
and
not
to
care
whether
you
were
hungry
or
not
and
not
to
live
in
the
world
at
all
but
only
in
your
own
head
for
the
world
is
a
tyrannous
place
you
have
to
raise
yourself
above
things
instead
of
letting
things
raise
themselves
above
you
we
must
not
be
slaves
to
each
other
and
we
must
not
be
slaves
to
our
necessities
either
that
is
the
problem
of
existence
there
is
no
dignity
in
life
at
all
if
hunger
can
shout
stop
at
every
turn
of
the
road
and
the
day
s
journey
is
measured
by
the
distance
between
one
sleep
and
the
next
sleep
life
is
all
slavery
and
nature
is
driving
us
with
the
whips
of
appetite
and
weariness
but
when
a
slave
rebels
he
ceases
to
be
a
slave
and
when
we
are
too
hungry
to
live
we
can
die
and
have
our
laugh
i
believe
that
nature
is
just
as
alive
as
we
are
and
that
she
is
as
much
frightened
of
us
as
we
are
of
her
and
mind
you
this
mankind
has
declared
war
against
nature
and
we
will
win
she
does
not
understand
yet
that
her
geologic
periods
won
t
do
any
longer
and
that
while
she
is
pattering
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
we
are
going
to
travel
fast
and
far
until
we
find
her
and
then
being
a
female
she
is
bound
to
give
in
when
she
is
it
s
good
talk
said
the
woman
but
it
s
foolishness
women
never
give
in
unless
they
get
what
they
want
and
where
s
the
harm
to
them
then
you
have
to
live
in
the
world
my
dear
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
believe
me
now
that
there
isn
t
any
wisdom
but
to
keep
clear
of
the
hunger
for
if
that
gets
near
enough
it
will
make
a
hare
of
you
sure
listen
to
reason
now
like
a
good
man
what
is
nature
at
all
but
a
word
that
learned
men
have
made
to
talk
about
there
s
clay
and
gods
and
men
and
they
are
good
friends
the
sun
had
long
since
gone
down
and
the
grey
evening
was
bowing
over
the
land
hiding
the
mountain
peaks
and
putting
a
shadow
round
the
scattered
bushes
and
the
wide
clumps
of
heather
i
know
a
place
up
here
where
we
can
stop
for
the
night
said
she
and
there
s
a
little
shebeen
round
the
bend
of
the
road
where
we
can
get
anything
we
at
the
word
whoh
the
ass
stopped
and
one
of
the
men
took
the
harness
off
him
when
he
was
unyoked
the
man
gave
him
two
kicks
be
off
with
you
you
devil
and
see
if
you
can
get
anything
to
eat
he
roared
the
ass
trotted
a
few
paces
off
and
searched
about
until
he
found
some
grass
he
ate
this
and
when
he
had
eaten
as
much
as
he
wanted
he
returned
and
lay
down
under
a
wall
he
lay
for
a
long
time
looking
in
the
one
direction
and
at
last
he
put
his
head
down
and
went
to
sleep
while
he
was
sleeping
he
kept
one
ear
up
and
the
other
ear
down
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
then
he
put
the
first
ear
down
and
the
other
one
up
and
he
kept
on
doing
this
all
the
night
if
he
had
anything
to
lose
you
wouldn
t
mind
him
setting
up
sentries
but
he
hadn
t
a
thing
in
the
world
except
his
skin
and
his
bones
and
no
one
would
be
bothered
stealing
them
one
of
the
men
took
a
long
bottle
out
of
the
cart
and
walked
up
the
road
with
it
the
other
man
lifted
out
a
tin
bucket
which
was
punched
all
over
with
jagged
holes
then
he
took
out
some
sods
of
turf
and
lumps
of
wood
and
he
put
these
in
the
bucket
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
a
very
nice
fire
lit
a
pot
of
water
was
put
on
to
boil
and
the
woman
cut
up
a
great
lump
of
bacon
which
she
put
into
the
pot
she
had
eight
eggs
in
a
place
in
the
cart
and
a
flat
loaf
of
bread
and
some
cold
boiled
potatoes
and
she
spread
her
apron
on
the
ground
and
arranged
these
things
on
it
the
other
man
came
down
the
road
again
with
his
big
bottle
filled
with
porter
and
he
put
this
in
a
safe
place
then
they
emptied
everything
out
of
the
cart
and
hoisted
it
over
the
little
wall
they
turned
the
cart
on
one
side
and
pulled
it
near
to
the
fire
and
they
all
sat
inside
the
cart
and
ate
their
supper
when
supper
was
done
they
lit
their
pipes
and
the
woman
lit
a
pipe
also
the
bottle
of
porter
was
brought
forward
and
they
took
drinks
in
turn
out
of
the
bottle
and
smoked
their
pipes
and
talked
there
was
no
moon
that
night
and
no
stars
so
that
just
beyond
the
fire
there
was
a
thick
darkness
which
one
would
not
like
to
look
at
it
was
so
cold
and
empty
while
talking
they
all
kept
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
fire
or
watched
the
smoke
from
their
pipes
drifting
and
curling
away
against
the
blackness
and
disappearing
as
suddenly
as
lightning
i
wonder
said
the
first
man
what
it
was
gave
you
the
idea
of
marrying
this
man
instead
of
myself
or
my
comrade
for
we
are
young
hardy
men
and
he
is
getting
old
god
help
him
aye
indeed
said
the
second
man
he
s
as
grey
as
a
badger
and
there
s
no
flesh
on
his
you
have
a
right
to
ask
that
said
she
and
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
didn
t
marry
either
of
you
you
are
only
a
pair
of
tinkers
going
from
one
place
to
another
and
not
knowing
anything
at
all
of
fine
things
but
himself
was
walking
along
the
road
looking
for
strange
high
adventures
and
it
s
a
man
like
that
a
woman
would
be
wishing
to
marry
if
he
was
twice
as
old
as
he
is
when
did
either
of
you
go
out
in
the
daylight
looking
for
a
god
and
you
not
caring
what
might
happen
to
you
or
where
you
went
what
i
m
thinking
said
the
second
man
is
that
if
you
leave
the
gods
alone
they
ll
leave
you
alone
it
s
no
trouble
to
them
to
do
whatever
is
right
themselves
and
what
call
would
men
like
us
have
to
go
mixing
or
meddling
with
their
high
affairs
i
thought
all
along
that
you
were
a
timid
man
said
she
and
now
i
know
she
turned
again
to
the
philosopher
take
off
your
boots
mister
honey
the
way
you
ll
rest
easy
and
i
ll
be
making
down
a
soft
bed
for
you
in
the
in
order
to
take
off
his
boots
the
philosopher
had
to
stand
up
for
in
the
cart
they
were
too
cramped
for
freedom
he
moved
backwards
a
space
from
the
fire
and
took
off
his
boots
he
could
see
the
woman
stretching
sacks
and
clothes
inside
the
cart
and
the
two
men
smoking
quietly
and
handing
the
big
bottle
from
one
to
the
other
then
in
his
stockinged
feet
he
stepped
a
little
farther
from
the
fire
and
after
another
look
he
turned
and
walked
quietly
away
into
the
blackness
in
a
few
minutes
he
heard
a
shout
from
behind
him
and
then
a
number
of
shouts
and
then
these
died
away
into
a
plaintive
murmur
of
voices
and
next
he
was
alone
in
the
greatest
darkness
he
had
ever
known
he
put
on
his
boots
and
walked
onwards
he
had
no
idea
where
the
road
lay
and
every
moment
he
stumbled
into
a
patch
of
heather
or
prickly
furze
the
ground
was
very
uneven
with
unexpected
mounds
and
deep
hollows
here
and
there
were
soggy
places
and
into
these
cold
ruins
he
sank
ankle
deep
there
was
no
longer
an
earth
or
a
sky
but
only
a
black
void
and
a
thin
wind
and
a
fierce
silence
which
seemed
to
listen
to
him
as
he
went
out
of
that
silence
a
thundering
laugh
might
boom
at
an
instant
and
stop
again
while
he
stood
appalled
in
the
blind
vacancy
the
hill
began
to
grow
more
steep
and
rocks
were
lying
everywhere
in
his
path
he
could
not
see
an
inch
in
front
and
so
he
went
with
his
hands
like
a
blind
man
who
stumbles
painfully
along
after
a
time
he
was
nearly
worn
out
with
cold
and
weariness
but
he
dared
not
sit
down
anywhere
the
darkness
was
so
intense
that
it
frightened
him
and
the
overwhelming
crafty
silence
frightened
him
also
at
last
and
at
a
great
distance
he
saw
a
flickering
waving
light
and
he
went
towards
this
through
drifts
of
heather
and
over
piled
rocks
and
sodden
bogland
when
he
came
to
the
light
he
saw
it
was
a
torch
of
thick
branches
the
flame
whereof
blew
hither
and
thither
on
the
wind
the
torch
was
fastened
against
a
great
cliff
of
granite
by
an
iron
band
at
one
side
there
was
a
dark
opening
in
the
rock
so
he
said
i
will
go
in
there
and
sleep
until
the
morning
comes
and
he
went
in
at
a
very
short
distance
the
cleft
turned
again
to
the
right
and
here
there
was
another
torch
fixed
when
he
turned
this
corner
he
stood
for
an
instant
in
speechless
astonishment
and
then
he
covered
his
face
and
bowed
down
upon
the
ground

caitilin
ni
murrachu
was
sitting
alone
in
the
little
cave
behind
gort
na
cloca
mora
her
companion
had
gone
out
as
was
his
custom
to
walk
in
the
sunny
morning
and
to
sound
his
pipe
in
desolate
green
spaces
whence
perhaps
the
wanderer
of
his
desire
might
hear
the
guiding
sweetness
as
she
sat
she
was
thinking
the
last
few
days
had
awakened
her
body
and
had
also
awakened
her
mind
for
with
the
one
awakening
comes
the
other
the
despondency
which
had
touched
her
previously
when
tending
her
father
s
cattle
came
to
her
again
but
recognizably
now
she
knew
the
thing
which
the
wind
had
whispered
in
the
sloping
field
and
for
which
she
had
no
name
it
was
happiness
faintly
she
shadowed
it
forth
but
yet
she
could
not
see
it
it
was
only
a
wraith
almost
formless
too
tenuous
to
be
touched
by
her
hands
and
too
aloof
to
be
spoken
to
pan
had
told
her
that
he
was
the
giver
of
happiness
but
he
had
given
her
only
unrest
and
fever
and
a
longing
which
could
not
be
satisfied
again
there
was
a
want
and
she
could
not
formulate
or
even
realize
it
with
any
closeness
her
thought
had
promised
everything
even
as
pan
and
it
had
given
she
could
not
say
that
it
had
given
her
nothing
or
anything
its
limits
were
too
quickly
divinable
she
had
found
the
tree
of
knowledge
but
about
on
every
side
a
great
wall
soared
blackly
enclosing
her
in
from
the
tree
of
life
a
wall
which
her
thought
was
unable
to
surmount
even
while
instinct
urged
that
it
must
topple
before
her
advance
but
instinct
may
not
advance
when
thought
has
schooled
it
in
the
science
of
unbelief
and
this
wall
will
not
be
conquered
until
thought
and
instinct
are
wed
and
the
first
son
of
that
bridal
will
be
called
the
scaler
of
the
wall
so
after
the
quiet
weariness
of
ignorance
the
unquiet
weariness
of
thought
had
fallen
upon
her
that
travail
of
mind
which
through
countless
generations
has
throed
to
the
birth
of
an
ecstasy
the
prophecy
which
humanity
has
sworn
must
be
fulfilled
seeing
through
whatever
mists
and
doubtings
the
vision
of
a
gaiety
wherein
the
innocence
of
the
morning
will
not
any
longer
be
strange
to
our
maturity
while
she
was
so
thinking
pan
returned
a
little
disheartened
that
he
had
found
no
person
to
listen
to
his
pipings
he
had
been
seated
but
a
little
time
when
suddenly
from
without
a
chorus
of
birds
burst
into
joyous
singing
limpid
and
liquid
cadenzas
mellow
flutings
and
the
sweet
treble
of
infancy
met
and
danced
and
piped
in
the
airy
soundings
a
round
soft
tenderness
of
song
rose
and
fell
broadened
and
soared
and
then
the
high
flight
was
snatched
eddied
a
moment
and
was
borne
away
to
a
more
slender
and
wonderful
loftiness
until
from
afar
that
thrilling
song
turned
on
the
very
apex
of
sweetness
dipped
steeply
and
flashed
its
joyous
return
to
the
exultations
of
its
mates
below
rolling
an
ecstasy
of
song
which
for
one
moment
gladdened
the
whole
world
and
the
sad
people
who
moved
thereon
then
the
singing
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
began
a
swift
shadow
darkened
the
passage
and
angus
og
came
into
the
cave
caitilin
sprang
from
her
seat
frighted
and
pan
also
made
a
half
movement
towards
rising
but
instantly
sank
back
again
to
his
negligent
easy
posture
the
god
was
slender
and
as
swift
as
a
wind
his
hair
swung
about
his
face
like
golden
blossoms
his
eyes
were
mild
and
dancing
and
his
lips
smiled
with
quiet
sweetness
about
his
head
there
flew
perpetually
a
ring
of
singing
birds
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
came
sweetly
from
a
centre
of
sweetness
health
to
you
daughter
of
murrachu
said
he
and
he
sat
down
i
do
not
know
you
sir
the
terrified
girl
whispered
i
can
not
be
known
until
i
make
myself
known
he
replied
i
am
called
infinite
joy
o
daughter
of
murrachu
and
i
am
called
the
girl
gazed
doubtfully
from
one
to
the
other
pan
looked
up
from
his
pipes
i
also
am
called
love
said
he
gently
and
i
am
called
angus
og
looked
for
the
first
time
at
pan
singer
of
the
vine
said
he
i
know
your
are
desire
and
fever
and
lust
and
death
why
have
you
come
from
your
own
place
to
spy
upon
my
pastures
and
my
quiet
fields
pan
replied
mildly
the
mortal
gods
move
by
the
immortal
will
and
therefore
i
am
and
i
am
here
said
angus
give
me
a
sign
said
pan
that
i
must
angus
og
lifted
his
hand
and
from
without
there
came
again
the
triumphant
music
of
the
birds
it
is
a
sign
said
he
the
voice
of
dana
speaking
in
the
air
and
saying
so
he
made
obeisance
to
the
great
mother
pan
lifted
his
hand
and
from
afar
there
came
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
and
the
thin
voices
of
the
goats
it
is
a
sign
said
he
the
voice
of
demeter
speaking
from
the
earth
and
he
also
bowed
deeply
to
the
mother
of
the
world
again
angus
og
lifted
his
hand
and
in
it
there
appeared
a
spear
bright
and
very
terrible
but
pan
only
said
can
a
spear
divine
the
eternal
will
and
angus
og
put
his
weapon
aside
and
he
said
the
girl
will
choose
between
us
for
the
divine
mood
shines
in
the
heart
of
then
caitilin
ni
murrachu
came
forward
and
sat
between
the
gods
but
pan
stretched
out
his
hand
and
drew
her
to
him
so
that
she
sat
resting
against
his
shoulder
and
his
arm
was
about
her
body
we
will
speak
the
truth
to
this
girl
said
angus
og
can
the
gods
speak
otherwise
said
pan
and
he
laughed
with
delight
it
is
the
difference
between
us
replied
angus
og
she
will
shepherd
girl
said
pan
pressing
her
with
his
arm
you
will
judge
between
us
do
you
know
what
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
because
it
is
of
that
you
will
have
to
i
have
heard
the
girl
replied
two
things
called
the
greatest
things
you
she
continued
to
pan
said
it
was
hunger
and
long
ago
my
father
said
that
commonsense
was
the
greatest
thing
in
the
i
have
not
told
you
said
angus
og
what
i
consider
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
it
is
your
right
to
speak
said
pan
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
said
angus
og
is
the
divine
now
said
pan
we
know
all
the
greatest
things
and
we
can
talk
of
the
daughter
of
murrachu
continued
angus
og
has
told
us
what
you
think
and
what
her
father
thinks
but
she
has
not
told
us
what
she
thinks
herself
tell
us
caitilin
ni
murrachu
what
you
think
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
so
caitilin
ni
murrachu
thought
for
a
few
moments
and
then
replied
timidly
i
think
that
happiness
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
said
she
hearing
this
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
little
time
and
then
angus
og
spoke
again
the
divine
imagination
may
only
be
known
through
the
thoughts
of
his
creatures
a
man
has
said
commonsense
and
a
woman
has
said
happiness
are
the
greatest
things
in
the
world
these
things
are
male
and
female
for
commonsense
is
thought
and
happiness
is
emotion
and
until
they
embrace
in
love
the
will
of
immensity
can
not
be
fruitful
for
behold
there
has
been
no
marriage
of
humanity
since
time
began
men
have
but
coupled
with
their
own
shadows
the
desire
that
sprang
from
their
heads
they
pursued
and
no
man
has
yet
known
the
love
of
a
woman
and
women
have
mated
with
the
shadows
of
their
own
hearts
thinking
fondly
that
the
arms
of
men
were
about
them
i
saw
my
son
dancing
with
an
idea
and
i
said
to
him
with
what
do
you
dance
my
son
and
he
replied
i
make
merry
with
the
wife
of
my
affection
and
truly
she
was
shaped
as
a
woman
is
shaped
but
it
was
an
idea
he
danced
with
and
not
a
woman
and
presently
he
went
away
to
his
labours
and
then
his
idea
arose
and
her
humanity
came
upon
her
so
that
she
was
clothed
with
beauty
and
terror
and
she
went
apart
and
danced
with
the
servant
of
my
son
and
there
was
great
joy
of
that
dancing
for
a
person
in
the
wrong
place
is
an
idea
and
not
a
person
man
is
thought
and
woman
is
intuition
and
they
have
never
mated
there
is
a
gulf
between
them
and
it
is
called
fear
and
what
they
fear
is
that
their
strengths
shall
be
taken
from
them
and
they
may
no
longer
be
tyrants
the
eternal
has
made
love
blind
for
it
is
not
by
science
but
by
intuition
alone
that
he
may
come
to
his
beloved
but
desire
which
is
science
has
many
eyes
and
sees
so
vastly
that
he
passes
his
love
in
the
press
saying
there
is
no
love
and
he
propagates
miserably
on
his
own
delusions
the
are
guided
by
god
but
the
devil
looks
through
the
eyes
of
all
creatures
so
that
they
may
wander
in
the
errors
of
reason
and
justify
themselves
of
their
wanderings
the
desire
of
a
man
shall
be
beauty
but
he
has
fashioned
a
slave
in
his
mind
and
called
it
virtue
the
desire
of
a
woman
shall
be
wisdom
but
she
has
formed
a
beast
in
her
blood
and
called
it
courage
but
the
real
virtue
is
courage
and
the
real
courage
is
liberty
and
the
real
liberty
is
wisdom
and
wisdom
is
the
son
of
thought
and
intuition
and
his
names
also
are
innocence
and
adoration
and
when
angus
og
had
said
these
words
he
ceased
and
for
a
time
there
was
silence
in
the
little
cave
caitilin
had
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
would
not
look
at
him
but
pan
drew
the
girl
closer
to
his
side
and
peered
sideways
laughing
at
angus
has
the
time
yet
come
for
the
girl
to
judge
between
us
said
he
daughter
of
murrachu
said
angus
og
will
you
come
away
with
me
from
this
place
caitilin
then
looked
at
the
god
in
great
distress
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
said
she
why
do
you
both
want
me
i
have
given
myself
to
pan
and
his
arms
are
about
i
want
you
said
angus
og
because
the
world
has
forgotten
me
in
all
my
nation
there
is
no
remembrance
of
me
i
wandering
on
the
hills
of
my
country
am
lonely
indeed
i
am
the
desolate
god
forbidden
to
utter
my
happy
laughter
i
hide
the
silver
of
my
speech
and
the
gold
of
my
merriment
i
live
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
the
dark
caves
of
the
sea
i
weep
in
the
morning
because
i
may
not
laugh
and
in
the
evening
i
go
abroad
and
am
not
happy
where
i
have
kissed
a
bird
has
flown
where
i
have
trod
a
flower
has
sprung
but
thought
has
snared
my
birds
in
his
nets
and
sold
them
in
the
who
will
deliver
me
from
thought
from
the
base
holiness
of
intellect
the
maker
of
chains
and
traps
who
will
save
me
from
the
holy
impurity
of
emotion
whose
daughters
are
envy
and
jealousy
and
hatred
who
plucks
my
flowers
to
ornament
her
lusts
and
my
little
leaves
to
shrivel
on
the
breasts
of
infamy
lo
i
am
sealed
in
the
caves
of
nonentity
until
the
head
and
the
heart
shall
come
together
in
fruitfulness
until
thought
has
wept
for
love
and
emotion
has
purified
herself
to
meet
her
lover
is
the
heart
of
a
man
and
the
head
of
a
woman
widely
they
are
separated
they
stand
and
between
them
the
seas
of
space
are
flooding
desolately
no
voice
can
shout
across
those
shores
no
eye
can
bridge
them
nor
any
desire
bring
them
together
until
the
blind
god
shall
find
them
on
the
wavering
stream
not
as
an
arrow
searches
straightly
from
a
bow
but
gently
imperceptibly
as
a
feather
on
the
wind
reaches
the
ground
on
a
hundred
starts
not
with
the
compass
and
the
chart
but
by
the
breath
of
the
almighty
which
blows
from
all
quarters
without

which
is
the
earth
or
the
creatures
that
move
upon
it
the
more
important
this
is
a
question
prompted
solely
by
intellectual
arrogance
for
in
life
there
is
no
greater
and
no
less
the
thing
that
is
has
justified
its
own
importance
by
mere
existence
for
that
is
the
great
and
equal
achievement
if
life
were
arranged
for
us
from
without
such
a
question
of
supremacy
would
assume
importance
but
life
is
always
from
within
and
is
modified
or
extended
by
our
own
appetites
aspirations
and
central
activities
from
without
we

and
the

of

it
is
sufficient
we
might
ask
is
the

anything
more
than
an
extension
of
our
human
consciousness
or
are
we
moving
creatures
only
projections
of
the

s
antennae
but
these
matters
have
no
value
save
as
a
field
wherein
thought
like
a
wise
lamb
may
frolic
merrily
and
all
would
be
very
well
if
thought
would
but
continue
to
frolic
instead
of
setting
up
first

and
sticking
to

and
afterwards
as
the
counsel
and
critic
of
omnipotence
everything
has
two
names
and
everything
is
twofold
the
name
of
male
thought
as
it
faces
the
world
is
philosophy
but
the
name
it
bears
in
is
delusion
female
thought
is
called
socialism
on
earth
but
in
eternity
it
is
known
as
illusion
and
this
is
so
because
there
has
been
no
matrimony
of
minds
but
only
an
hermaphroditic
propagation
of
automatic
ideas
which
in
their
due
rotation
assume
dominance
and
reign
severely
to
the
world
this
system
of
thought
because
it
is
consecutive
is
known
as
logic
but
eternity
has
written
it
down
in
the
book
of
errors
as
mechanism
for
life
may
not
be
consecutive
but
explosive
and
variable
else
it
is
a
shackled
and
timorous
slave
one
of
the
great
troubles
of
life
is
that
reason
has
taken
charge
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
by
mere
identification
it
has
achieved
the
crown
and
sceptre
of
its
master
but
the
imperceptible
usurpation
was
recorded
and
discriminating
minds
understand
the
chasm
which
still
divides
the
pretender
law
from
the
exiled
king
in
a
like
manner
and
with
feigned
humility
the
cold
demon
advanced
to
serve
religion
and
by
guile
and
violence
usurped
her
throne
but
the
pure
in
heart
still
fly
from
the
spectre
theology
to
dance
in
ecstasy
before
the
starry
and
eternal
goddess
statecraft
also
that
tender
shepherd
of
the
flocks
has
been
despoiled
of
his
crook
and
bell
and
wanders
in
unknown
desolation
while
beneath
the
banner
of
politics
reason
sits
howling
over
an
intellectual
chaos
justice
is
the
maintaining
of
equilibrium
the
blood
of
cain
must
cry
not
from
the
lips
of
the
avenger
but
from
the
aggrieved
earth
herself
who
demands
that
atonement
shall
be
made
for
a
disturbance
of
her
consciousness
all
justice
is
therefore
readjustment
a
thwarted
consciousness
has
every
right
to
clamour
for
assistance
but
not
for
punishment
this
latter
can
only
be
sought
by
timorous
and
egotistic
intellect
which
sees
the
earth
from
which
it
has
emerged
and
into
which
it
must
return
again
in
its
own
despite
and
so
being
and
envious
and
a
renegade
from
life
reason
is
more
cruelly
unjust
and
more
timorous
than
any
other
manifestation
of
the
divinely
erratic
energy
erratic
because
as
has
been
said
the
crooked
roads
are
the
roads
of
nature
grants
to
all
her
creatures
an
unrestricted
liberty
quickened
by
competitive
appetite
to
succeed
or
to
fail
save
only
to
reason
her
demon
of
order
which
can
do
neither
and
whose
wings
she
has
clipped
for
some
reason
with
which
i
am
not
yet
acquainted
it
may
be
that
an
unrestricted
mentality
would
endanger
her
own
intuitive
perceptions
by
shackling
all
her
other
organs
of
perception
or
annoy
her
by
vexatious
efforts
at
creative
rivalry
it
will
therefore
be
understood
that
when
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
acted
in
the
manner
about
to
be
recorded
they
were
not
prompted
by
any
lewd
passion
for
revenge
but
were
merely
striving
to
reconstruct
a
rhythm
which
was
their
very
existence
and
which
must
have
been
of
direct
importance
to
the
earth
revenge
is
the
vilest
passion
known
to
life
it
has
made
law
possible
and
by
doing
so
it
gave
to
intellect
the
first
grip
at
that
universal
dominion
which
is
its
ambition
a
leprecaun
is
of
more
value
to
the
earth
than
is
a
prime
minister
or
a
stockbroker
because
a
leprecaun
dances
and
makes
merry
while
a
prime
minister
knows
nothing
of
these
natural
virtues
consequently
an
injury
done
to
a
leprecaun
afflicts
the
earth
with
misery
and
justice
is
for
these
reasons
an
imperative
and
momentous
necessity
a
community
of
leprecauns
without
a
crock
of
gold
is
a
blighted
and
merriless
community
and
they
are
certainly
justified
in
seeking
sympathy
and
assistance
for
the
recovery
of
so
essential
a
treasure
but
the
steps
whereby
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
sought
to
regain
their
property
must
for
ever
brand
their
memory
with
a
certain
odium
it
should
be
remembered
in
their
favour
that
they
were
cunningly
and
cruelly
encompassed
not
only
was
their
gold
stolen
but
it
was
buried
in
such
a
position
as
placed
it
under
the
protection
of
their
own
communal
honour
and
the
household
of
their
enemy
was
secured
against
their
active
and
righteous
malice
because
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
belonged
to
the
most
powerful
shee
of
ireland
it
is
in
circumstances
such
as
these
that
dangerous
alliances
are
made
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
elemental
beings
invoked
bourgeois
assistance
they
were
loath
to
do
it
and
justice
must
record
the
fact
they
were
angry
when
they
did
it
and
anger
is
both
mental
and
intuitive
blindness
it
is
not
the
beneficent
blindness
which
prevents
one
from
seeing
without
but
it
is
that
desperate
darkness
which
cloaks
the
within
and
hides
the
heart
and
the
brain
from
each
other
s
husbandry
and
wifely
recognition
but
even
those
mitigating
circumstances
can
not
justify
the
course
they
adopted
and
the
wider
idea
must
be
sought
for
that
out
of
evil
good
must
ultimately
come
or
else
evil
is
vitiated
beyond
even
the
redemption
of
usage
when
they
were
able
to
realize
of
what
they
had
been
guilty
they
were
very
sorry
indeed
and
endeavoured
to
publish
their
repentance
in
many
ways
but
lacking
atonement
repentance
is
only
a
virtue
which
is
good
for
nothing
but
burial
when
the
leprecauns
of
gort
na
cloca
mora
found
they
were
unable
to
regain
their
crock
of
gold
by
any
means
they
laid
an
anonymous
information
at
the
nearest
police
station
showing
that
two
dead
bodies
would
be
found
under
the
hearthstone
in
the
hut
of
coille
doraca
and
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
their
crafty
missive
was
that
these
bodies
had
been
murdered
by
the
philosopher
for
reasons
very
discreditable
to
him
the
philosopher
had
been
scarcely
more
than
three
hours
on
his
journey
to
angus
og
when
four
policemen
approached
the
little
house
from
as
many
different
directions
and
without
any
trouble
they
effected
an
entrance
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
and
the
two
children
heard
from
afar
their
badly
muffled
advance
and
on
discovering
the
character
of
their
visitors
they
concealed
themselves
among
the
thickly
clustering
trees
shortly
after
the
men
had
entered
the
hut
loud
and
sustained
noises
began
to
issue
therefrom
and
in
about
twenty
minutes
the
invaders
emerged
again
bearing
the
bodies
of
the
grey
woman
of
dun
gortin
and
her
husband
they
wrenched
the
door
off
its
hinges
and
placing
the
bodies
on
the
door
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
through
the
trees
and
disappeared
in
a
short
time
when
they
had
departed
the
thin
woman
and
the
children
returned
to
their
home
and
over
the
yawning
hearth
the
thin
woman
pronounced
a
long
and
fervid
malediction
wherein
policemen
were
exhibited
naked
before
the
blushes
of
eternity
with
your
let
us
now
return
to
the
philosopher
following
his
interview
with
angus
og
the
philosopher
received
the
blessing
of
the
god
and
returned
on
his
homeward
journey
when
he
left
the
cave
he
had
no
knowledge
where
he
was
nor
whether
he
should
turn
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
this
alone
was
his
guiding
idea
that
as
he
had
come
up
the
mountain
on
his
first
journey
his
must
by
mere
opposition
be
down
the
mountain
and
accordingly
he
set
his
face
downhill
and
trod
lustily
forward
he
had
stamped
up
the
hill
with
vigour
he
strode
down
it
in
ecstasy
he
tossed
his
voice
on
every
wind
that
went
by
from
the
wells
of
forgetfulness
he
regained
the
shining
words
and
gay
melodies
which
his
childhood
had
delighted
in
and
these
he
sang
loudly
and
unceasingly
as
he
marched
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
but
far
away
a
quiet
brightness
was
creeping
over
the
sky
the
daylight
however
was
near
the
full
one
slender
veil
only
remaining
of
the
shadows
and
a
calm
unmoving
quietude
brooded
from
the
grey
sky
to
the
whispering
earth
the
birds
had
begun
to
bestir
themselves
but
not
to
sing
now
and
again
a
solitary
wing
feathered
the
chill
air
but
for
the
most
part
the
birds
huddled
closer
in
the
swinging
nests
or
under
the
bracken
or
in
the
tufty
grass
here
a
faint
twitter
was
heard
and
ceased
a
little
farther
a
drowsy
voice
called
and
turned
again
to
the
warmth
of
its
wing
the
very
grasshoppers
were
silent
the
creatures
who
range
in
the
night
time
had
returned
to
their
cells
and
were
setting
their
households
in
order
and
those
who
belonged
to
the
day
hugged
their
comfort
for
but
one
minute
longer
then
the
first
level
beam
stepped
like
a
mild
angel
to
the
mountain
top
the
slender
radiance
brightened
and
grew
strong
the
grey
veil
faded
away
the
birds
leaped
from
their
nests
the
grasshoppers
awakened
and
were
busy
at
a
stroke
voice
called
to
voice
without
ceasing
and
momently
a
song
thrilled
for
a
few
wide
seconds
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
they
went
as
they
soared
and
plunged
and
swept
each
bird
eager
for
its
breakfast
the
philosopher
thrust
his
hand
into
his
wallet
and
found
there
the
last
broken
remnants
of
his
cake
and
the
instant
his
hand
touched
the
food
he
was
seized
by
a
hunger
so
furious
that
he
sat
down
where
he
stopped
and
prepared
to
eat
the
place
where
he
sat
was
a
raised
bank
under
a
hedge
and
this
place
directly
fronted
a
clumsy
wooden
gate
leading
into
a
great
field
when
the
philosopher
had
seated
himself
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
through
the
gate
a
small
company
approaching
there
were
four
men
and
three
women
and
each
of
them
carried
a
metal
pail
the
philosopher
with
a
sigh
returned
the
cake
to
his
wallet
saying
all
men
are
brothers
and
it
may
be
that
these
people
are
as
hungry
as
i
in
a
short
time
the
strangers
came
near
the
foremost
of
them
was
a
huge
man
who
was
bearded
to
the
eyelids
and
who
moved
like
a
strong
wind
he
opened
the
gate
by
removing
a
piece
of
wood
wherewith
it
was
jammed
and
he
and
his
companions
passed
through
whereupon
he
closed
the
gate
and
secured
it
to
this
man
as
being
the
eldest
the
philosopher
approached
i
am
about
to
breakfast
said
he
and
if
you
are
hungry
perhaps
you
would
like
to
eat
with
why
not
said
the
man
for
the
person
who
would
refuse
a
kind
invitation
is
a
dog
these
are
my
three
sons
and
three
of
my
daughters
and
we
are
all
thankful
to
saying
this
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
his
companions
placing
their
pails
behind
them
did
likewise
the
philosopher
divided
his
cake
into
eight
pieces
and
gave
one
to
each
person
i
am
sorry
it
is
so
little
said
he
a
gift
said
the
bearded
man
is
never
little
and
he
courteously
ate
his
piece
in
three
bites
although
he
could
have
easily
eaten
it
in
one
and
his
children
also
that
was
a
good
satisfying
cake
said
he
when
he
had
finished
it
was
well
baked
and
well
shared
but
he
continued
i
am
in
a
difficulty
and
maybe
you
could
advise
me
what
to
do
sir
what
might
be
your
trouble
said
the
philosopher
it
is
this
said
the
man
every
morning
when
we
go
out
to
milk
the
cows
the
mother
of
my
clann
gives
to
each
of
us
a
parcel
of
food
so
that
we
need
not
be
any
hungrier
than
we
like
but
now
we
have
had
a
good
breakfast
with
you
what
shall
we
do
with
the
food
that
we
brought
with
us
the
woman
of
the
house
would
not
be
pleased
if
we
carried
it
back
to
her
and
if
we
threw
food
away
it
would
be
a
sin
if
it
was
not
disrespectful
to
your
breakfast
the
boys
and
girls
here
might
be
able
to
get
rid
of
it
by
eating
it
for
as
you
know
young
people
can
always
eat
a
bit
more
no
matter
how
much
they
have
already
it
would
surely
be
better
to
eat
it
than
to
waste
it
said
the
philosopher
wistfully
the
young
people
produced
large
parcels
of
food
from
their
pockets
and
opened
them
and
the
bearded
man
said
i
have
a
little
one
myself
also
and
it
would
not
be
wasted
if
you
were
kind
enough
to
help
me
to
eat
it
and
he
pulled
out
his
parcel
which
was
twice
as
big
as
any
of
the
others
he
opened
the
parcel
and
handed
the
larger
part
of
its
contents
to
the
philosopher
he
then
plunged
a
tin
vessel
into
one
of
the
milk
pails
and
set
this
also
by
the
philosopher
and
instantly
they
all
began
to
eat
with
furious
appetite
when
the
meal
was
finished
the
philosopher
filled
his
tobacco
pipe
and
the
bearded
man
and
his
three
sons
did
likewise
sir
said
the
bearded
man
i
would
be
glad
to
know
why
you
are
travelling
abroad
so
early
in
the
morning
for
at
this
hour
no
one
stirs
but
the
sun
and
the
birds
and
the
folk
who
like
ourselves
follow
the
cattle
i
will
tell
you
that
gladly
said
the
philosopher
if
you
will
tell
me
your
my
name
said
the
bearded
man
is
mac
last
night
said
the
philosopher
when
i
came
from
the
house
of
angus
og
in
the
caves
of
the
sleepers
of
erinn
i
was
bidden
say
to
a
man
named
mac
the
horses
had
trampled
in
their
sleep
and
the
sleepers
had
turned
on
their
sir
said
the
bearded
man
your
words
thrill
in
my
heart
like
music
but
my
head
does
not
understand
i
have
learned
said
the
philosopher
that
the
head
does
not
hear
anything
until
the
heart
has
listened
and
that
what
the
heart
knows
the
head
will
understand
all
the
birds
of
the
world
are
singing
in
my
soul
said
the
bearded
man
and
i
bless
you
because
you
have
filled
me
with
hope
and
so
the
philosopher
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
he
shook
the
hands
of
his
sons
and
daughters
who
bowed
before
him
at
the
mild
command
of
their
father
and
when
he
had
gone
a
little
way
he
looked
around
again
and
he
saw
that
group
of
people
standing
where
he
had
left
them
and
the
bearded
man
was
embracing
his
children
on
the
highroad
a
bend
in
the
path
soon
shut
them
from
view
and
then
the
philosopher
fortified
by
food
and
the
freshness
of
the
morning
strode
onwards
singing
for
very
joy
it
was
still
early
but
now
the
birds
had
eaten
their
breakfasts
and
were
devoting
themselves
to
each
other
they
rested
side
by
side
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
on
the
hedges
they
danced
in
the
air
in
happy
brotherhoods
and
they
sang
to
one
another
amiable
and
pleasant
ditties
when
the
philosopher
had
walked
for
a
long
time
he
felt
a
little
weary
and
sat
down
to
refresh
himself
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
tree
hard
by
there
was
a
house
of
rugged
stone
long
years
ago
it
had
been
a
castle
and
even
now
though
patched
by
time
and
misfortune
its
front
was
warlike
and
frowning
while
he
sat
a
young
woman
came
along
the
road
and
stood
gazing
earnestly
at
this
house
her
hair
was
as
black
as
night
and
as
smooth
as
still
water
but
her
face
came
so
stormily
forward
that
her
quiet
attitude
had
yet
no
quietness
in
it
to
her
after
a
few
moments
the
philosopher
spoke
girl
said
he
why
do
you
look
so
earnestly
at
the
house
the
girl
turned
her
pale
face
and
stared
at
him
i
did
not
notice
you
sitting
under
the
tree
said
she
and
she
came
slowly
forward
sit
down
by
me
said
the
philosopher
and
we
will
talk
if
you
are
in
any
trouble
tell
it
to
me
and
perhaps
you
will
talk
the
heaviest
part
i
will
sit
beside
you
willingly
said
the
girl
and
she
did
so
it
is
good
to
talk
trouble
over
he
continued
do
you
know
that
talk
is
a
real
thing
there
is
more
power
in
speech
than
many
people
conceive
thoughts
come
from
god
they
are
born
through
the
marriage
of
the
head
and
the
lungs
the
head
moulds
the
thought
into
the
form
of
words
then
it
is
borne
and
sounded
on
the
air
which
has
been
already
in
the
secret
kingdoms
of
the
body
which
goes
in
bearing
life
and
come
out
freighted
with
wisdom
for
this
reason
a
lie
is
very
terrible
because
it
is
turning
mighty
and
incomprehensible
things
to
base
uses
and
is
burdening
the
element
with
a
foul
return
for
its
goodness
but
those
who
speak
the
truth
and
whose
words
are
the
symbols
of
wisdom
and
beauty
these
purify
the
whole
world
and
daunt
contagion
the
only
trouble
the
body
can
know
is
disease
all
other
miseries
come
from
the
brain
and
as
these
belong
to
thought
they
can
be
driven
out
by
their
master
as
unruly
and
unpleasant
vagabonds
for
a
mental
trouble
should
be
spoken
to
confronted
reprimanded
and
so
dismissed
the
brain
can
not
afford
to
harbour
any
but
pleasant
and
eager
citizens
who
will
do
their
part
in
making
laughter
and
holiness
for
the
world
for
that
is
the
duty
of
while
the
philosopher
spoke
the
girl
had
been
regarding
him
steadfastly
sir
said
she
we
tell
our
hearts
to
a
young
man
and
our
heads
to
an
old
man
and
when
the
heart
is
a
fool
the
head
is
bound
to
be
a
liar
i
can
tell
you
the
things
i
know
but
how
will
i
tell
you
the
things
i
feel
when
i
myself
do
not
understand
them
if
i
say
these
words
to
you
i
love
a
man
i
do
not
say
anything
at
all
and
you
do
not
hear
one
of
the
words
which
my
heart
is
repeating
over
and
over
to
itself
in
the
silence
of
my
body
young
people
are
fools
in
their
heads
and
old
people
are
fools
in
their
hearts
and
they
can
only
look
at
each
other
and
pass
by
in
you
are
wrong
said
the
philosopher
an
old
person
can
take
your
hand
like
this
and
say
may
every
good
thing
come
to
you
my
for
all
trouble
there
is
sympathy
and
for
love
there
is
memory
and
these
are
the
head
and
the
heart
talking
to
each
other
in
quiet
friendship
what
the
heart
knows
the
head
will
understand
and
as
the
head
must
be
the
scholar
of
the
heart
it
is
necessary
that
our
hearts
be
purified
and
free
from
every
false
thing
else
we
are
tainted
beyond
personal
sir
said
the
girl
i
know
of
two
great
are
love
and
speech
for
when
these
are
given
they
can
never
be
taken
back
again
and
the
person
to
whom
these
are
given
is
not
any
richer
but
the
giver
is
made
poor
and
abashed
i
gave
my
love
to
a
man
who
did
not
want
it
i
told
him
of
my
love
and
he
lifted
his
eyelids
at
me
that
is
my
for
a
moment
the
philosopher
sat
in
stricken
silence
looking
on
the
ground
he
had
a
strange
disinclination
to
look
at
the
girl
although
he
felt
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
him
but
in
a
little
while
he
did
look
at
her
and
spoke
again
to
carry
gifts
to
an
ungrateful
person
can
not
be
justified
and
need
not
be
mourned
for
if
your
love
is
noble
why
do
you
treat
it
meanly
if
it
is
lewd
the
man
was
right
to
reject
we
love
as
the
wind
blows
she
replied
there
is
a
thing
said
the
philosopher
and
it
is
both
the
biggest
and
the
littlest
thing
in
the
what
is
that
said
the
girl
it
is
pride
he
answered
it
lives
in
an
empty
house
the
head
which
has
never
been
visited
by
the
heart
is
the
house
pride
lives
in
you
are
in
error
my
dear
and
not
in
love
drive
out
the
knave
pride
put
a
flower
in
your
hair
and
walk
freely
the
girl
laughed
and
suddenly
her
pale
face
became
rosy
as
the
dawn
and
as
radiant
and
lovely
as
a
cloud
she
shed
warmth
and
beauty
about
her
as
she
leaned
forward
you
are
wrong
she
whispered
because
he
does
love
me
but
he
does
not
know
it
yet
he
is
young
and
full
of
fury
and
has
no
time
to
look
at
women
but
he
looked
at
me
my
heart
knows
it
and
my
head
knows
it
but
i
am
impatient
and
yearn
for
him
to
look
at
me
again
his
heart
will
remember
me
and
he
will
come
searching
for
me
with
prayers
and
tears
with
shouts
and
threats
i
will
be
very
hard
to
find
when
he
holds
out
his
arms
to
the
air
and
the
sky
and
is
astonished
and
frightened
to
find
me
nowhere
i
will
hide
from
him
and
frown
at
him
when
he
speaks
and
turn
aside
when
he
follows
me
until
the
day
after
when
he
will
frighten
me
with
his
anger
and
hold
me
with
his
furious
hands
and
make
me
look
at
saying
this
the
girl
arose
and
prepared
to
go
away
he
is
in
that
house
said
she
and
i
would
not
let
him
see
me
here
for
anything
in
the
you
have
wasted
all
my
time
said
the
philosopher
smiling
what
else
is
time
for
said
the
girl
and
she
kissed
the
philosopher
and
ran
swiftly
down
the
road
she
had
been
gone
but
a
few
moments
when
a
man
came
out
of
the
grey
house
and
walked
quickly
across
the
grass
when
he
reached
the
hedge
separating
the
field
from
the
road
he
tossed
his
two
arms
in
the
air
swung
them
down
and
jumped
over
the
hedge
into
the
roadway
he
was
a
short
dark
youth
and
so
swift
and
sudden
were
his
movements
that
he
seemed
to
look
on
every
side
at
the
one
moment
although
he
bore
furiously
to
his
own
direction
the
philosopher
addressed
him
mildly
that
was
a
good
jump
said
he
the
young
man
spun
around
from
where
he
stood
and
was
by
the
philosopher
s
side
in
an
instant
it
would
be
a
good
jump
for
other
men
said
he
but
it
is
only
a
little
jump
for
me
you
are
very
dusty
sir
you
must
have
travelled
a
long
distance
a
long
distance
replied
the
philosopher
sit
down
here
my
friend
and
keep
me
company
for
a
little
i
do
not
like
sitting
down
said
the
young
man
but
i
always
consent
to
a
request
and
i
always
accept
and
so
saying
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
do
you
work
in
that
big
house
said
the
philosopher
i
do
he
replied
i
train
the
hounds
for
a
fat
jovial
man
full
of
laughter
and
i
think
you
do
not
like
your
believe
sir
that
i
do
not
like
any
master
but
this
man
i
hate
i
have
been
a
week
in
his
service
and
he
has
not
once
looked
on
me
as
on
a
friend
this
very
day
in
the
kennel
he
passed
me
as
though
i
were
a
tree
or
a
stone
i
almost
leaped
to
catch
him
by
the
throat
and
say
dog
do
you
not
salute
your
but
i
looked
after
him
and
let
him
go
for
it
would
be
an
unpleasant
thing
to
strangle
a
fat
if
you
are
displeased
with
your
master
should
you
not
look
for
another
occupation
said
the
philosopher
i
was
thinking
of
that
and
i
was
thinking
whether
i
ought
to
kill
him
or
marry
his
daughter
she
would
have
passed
me
by
as
her
father
did
but
i
would
not
let
a
woman
do
that
to
me
no
man
what
did
you
do
to
her
said
the
philosopher
the
young
man
chuckled
i
did
not
look
at
her
the
first
time
and
when
she
came
near
me
the
second
time
i
looked
another
way
and
on
the
third
day
she
spoke
to
me
and
while
she
stood
i
looked
over
her
shoulder
distantly
she
said
she
hoped
i
would
be
happy
in
my
new
home
and
she
made
her
voice
sound
pleasant
while
she
said
it
but
i
thanked
her
and
turned
away
is
the
girl
beautiful
said
the
philosopher
i
do
not
know
he
replied
i
have
not
looked
at
her
yet
although
now
i
see
her
everywhere
i
think
she
is
a
woman
who
would
annoy
me
if
i
married
if
you
haven
t
seen
her
how
can
you
think
that
she
has
tame
feet
said
the
youth
i
looked
at
them
and
they
got
frightened
where
have
you
travelled
from
sir
i
will
tell
you
that
said
the
philosopher
if
you
will
tell
me
your
it
is
easily
told
he
answered
my
name
is
when
i
came
last
night
said
the
philosopher
from
the
place
of
angus
og
in
the
cave
of
the
sleepers
of
erinn
i
was
bidden
say
to
a
man
named
macculain
that
the
grey
of
macha
had
neighed
in
his
sleep
and
the
sword
of
laeg
clashed
on
the
floor
as
he
turned
in
his
the
young
man
leaped
from
the
grass
sir
said
he
in
a
strained
voice
i
do
not
understand
your
words
but
they
make
my
heart
to
dance
and
sing
within
me
like
a
if
you
listen
to
your
heart
said
the
philosopher
you
will
learn
every
good
thing
for
the
heart
is
the
fountain
of
wisdom
tossing
its
thoughts
up
to
the
brain
which
gives
them
form
and
so
saying
he
saluted
the
youth
and
went
again
on
his
way
by
the
curving
road
now
the
day
had
advanced
noon
was
long
past
and
the
strong
sunlight
blazed
ceaselessly
on
the
world
his
path
was
still
on
the
high
mountains
running
on
for
a
short
distance
and
twisting
perpetually
to
the
right
hand
and
to
the
left
one
might
scarcely
call
it
a
path
it
grew
so
narrow
sometimes
indeed
it
almost
ceased
to
be
a
path
for
the
grass
had
stolen
forward
inch
by
inch
to
cover
up
the
tracks
of
man
there
were
no
hedges
but
rough
tumbled
ground
only
which
was
patched
by
trailing
bushes
and
stretched
away
in
mounds
and
hummocks
beyond
the
far
horizon
there
was
a
deep
silence
everywhere
not
painful
for
where
the
sun
shines
there
is
no
sorrow
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
swish
of
long
grasses
against
his
feet
as
he
trod
and
the
buzz
of
an
occasional
bee
that
came
and
was
gone
in
an
instant
the
philosopher
was
very
hungry
and
he
looked
about
on
all
sides
to
see
if
there
was
anything
he
might
eat
if
i
were
a
goat
or
a
cow
said
he
i
could
eat
this
grass
and
be
nourished
if
i
were
a
donkey
i
could
crop
the
hard
thistles
which
are
growing
on
every
hand
or
if
i
were
a
bird
i
could
feed
on
the
caterpillars
and
creeping
things
which
stir
innumerably
everywhere
but
a
man
may
not
eat
even
in
the
midst
of
plenty
because
he
has
departed
from
nature
and
lives
by
crafty
and
twisted
speaking
in
this
manner
he
chanced
to
lift
his
eyes
from
the
ground
and
saw
far
away
a
solitary
figure
which
melted
into
the
folding
earth
and
reappeared
again
in
a
different
place
so
peculiar
and
erratic
were
the
movements
of
this
figure
that
the
philosopher
had
great
difficulty
in
following
it
and
indeed
would
have
been
unable
to
follow
but
that
the
other
chanced
in
his
direction
when
they
came
nearer
he
saw
it
was
a
young
boy
who
was
dancing
hither
and
thither
in
any
and
every
direction
a
bushy
mound
hid
him
for
an
instant
and
the
next
they
were
standing
face
to
face
staring
at
each
other
after
a
moment
s
silence
the
boy
who
was
about
twelve
years
of
age
and
as
beautiful
as
the
morning
saluted
the
philosopher
have
you
lost
your
way
sir
said
he
all
paths
the
philosopher
replied
are
on
the
earth
and
so
one
can
never
be
lost
but
i
have
lost
my
the
boy
commenced
to
laugh
what
are
you
laughing
at
my
son
said
the
philosopher
because
he
replied
i
am
bringing
you
your
dinner
i
wondered
what
sent
me
out
in
this
direction
for
i
generally
go
more
to
the
have
you
got
my
dinner
said
the
philosopher
anxiously
i
have
said
the
boy
i
ate
my
own
dinner
at
home
and
i
put
your
dinner
in
my
pocket
i
thought
he
explained
that
i
might
be
hungry
if
i
went
far
the
gods
directed
you
said
the
philosopher
they
often
do
said
the
boy
and
he
pulled
a
small
parcel
from
his
pocket
the
philosopher
instantly
sat
down
and
the
boy
handed
him
the
parcel
he
opened
this
and
found
bread
and
cheese
it
s
a
good
dinner
said
he
and
commenced
to
eat
would
you
not
like
a
piece
also
my
son
i
would
like
a
little
piece
said
the
boy
and
he
sat
down
before
the
philosopher
and
they
ate
together
happily
when
they
had
finished
the
philosopher
praised
the
gods
and
then
said
more
to
himself
than
to
the
boy
if
i
had
a
little
drink
of
water
i
would
want
nothing
there
is
a
stream
four
paces
from
here
said
his
companion
i
will
get
some
water
in
my
cap
and
he
leaped
away
in
a
few
moments
he
came
back
holding
his
cap
tenderly
and
the
philosopher
took
this
and
drank
the
water
i
want
nothing
more
in
the
world
said
he
except
to
talk
with
you
the
sun
is
shining
the
wind
is
pleasant
and
the
grass
is
soft
sit
down
beside
me
again
for
a
little
so
the
boy
sat
down
and
the
philosopher
lit
his
pipe
do
you
live
far
from
here
said
he
not
far
said
the
boy
you
could
see
my
mother
s
house
from
this
place
if
you
were
as
tall
as
a
tree
and
even
from
the
ground
you
can
see
a
shape
of
smoke
yonder
that
floats
over
our
the
philosopher
looked
but
could
see
nothing
my
eyes
are
not
as
good
as
yours
are
said
he
because
i
am
getting
what
does
it
feel
like
to
be
old
said
the
boy
it
feels
stiff
like
said
the
philosopher
is
that
all
said
the
boy
i
don
t
know
the
philosopher
replied
after
a
few
moments
silence
can
you
tell
me
what
it
looks
like
to
be
young
why
not
said
the
boy
and
then
a
slight
look
of
perplexity
crossed
his
face
and
he
continued
i
don
t
think
i
young
people
said
the
philosopher
do
not
know
what
age
is
and
old
people
forget
what
youth
was
when
you
begin
to
grow
old
always
think
deeply
of
your
youth
for
an
old
man
without
memories
is
a
wasted
life
and
nothing
is
worth
remembering
but
our
childhood
i
will
tell
you
some
of
the
differences
between
being
old
and
young
and
then
you
can
ask
me
questions
and
so
we
will
get
at
both
sides
of
the
matter
first
an
old
man
gets
tired
quicker
than
a
the
boy
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
that
is
not
a
great
difference
for
a
boy
does
get
very
the
philosopher
continued
an
old
man
does
not
want
to
eat
as
often
as
a
that
is
not
a
great
difference
either
the
boy
replied
for
they
both
do
eat
tell
me
the
big
i
do
not
know
it
my
son
but
i
have
always
thought
there
was
a
big
difference
perhaps
it
is
that
an
old
man
has
memories
of
things
which
a
boy
can
not
even
guess
but
they
both
have
memories
said
the
boy
laughing
and
so
it
is
not
a
big
that
is
true
said
the
philosopher
maybe
there
is
not
so
much
difference
after
all
tell
me
things
you
do
and
we
will
see
if
i
can
do
them
but
i
don
t
know
what
i
do
he
replied
you
must
know
the
things
you
do
said
the
philosopher
but
you
may
not
understand
how
to
put
them
in
order
the
great
trouble
about
any
kind
of
examination
is
to
know
where
to
begin
but
there
are
always
two
places
in
everything
with
which
we
can
commence
they
are
the
beginning
and
the
end
from
either
of
these
points
a
view
may
be
had
which
comprehends
the
entire
period
so
we
will
begin
with
the
things
you
did
this
i
am
satisfied
with
that
said
the
boy
the
philosopher
then
continued
when
you
awakened
this
morning
and
went
out
of
the
house
what
was
the
first
thing
you
did
the
boy
thought
i
went
out
then
i
picked
up
a
stone
and
threw
it
into
the
field
as
far
as
i
what
then
said
the
philosopher
then
i
ran
after
the
stone
to
see
could
i
catch
up
on
it
before
it
hit
the
yes
said
the
philosopher
i
ran
so
fast
that
i
tumbled
over
myself
into
the
what
did
you
do
after
that
i
lay
where
i
fell
and
plucked
handfuls
of
the
grass
with
both
hands
and
threw
them
on
my
did
you
get
up
then
no
i
pressed
my
face
into
the
grass
and
shouted
a
lot
of
times
with
my
mouth
against
the
ground
and
then
i
sat
up
and
did
not
move
for
a
long
were
you
thinking
said
the
philosopher
no
i
was
not
thinking
or
doing
why
did
you
do
all
these
things
said
the
philosopher
for
no
reason
at
all
said
the
boy
that
said
the
philosopher
triumphantly
is
the
difference
between
age
and
youth
boys
do
things
for
no
reason
and
old
people
do
not
i
wonder
do
we
get
old
because
we
do
things
by
reason
instead
of
instinct
i
don
t
know
said
the
boy
everything
gets
old
have
you
travelled
very
far
sir
i
will
tell
you
that
if
you
will
tell
me
your
my
name
said
the
boy
is
when
i
came
last
night
said
the
philosopher
from
the
place
of
angus
og
in
the
caste
of
the
sleepers
i
was
bidden
say
to
one
named
maccushin
that
a
son
would
be
born
to
angus
og
and
his
wife
caitilin
and
that
the
sleepers
of
erinn
had
turned
in
their
the
boy
regarded
him
steadfastly
i
know
said
he
why
angus
og
sent
me
that
message
he
wants
me
to
make
a
poem
to
the
people
of
erinn
so
that
when
the
sleepers
arise
they
will
meet
with
the
sleepers
have
arisen
said
the
philosopher
they
are
about
us
on
every
side
they
are
walking
now
but
they
have
forgotten
their
names
and
the
meanings
of
their
names
you
are
to
tell
them
their
names
and
their
lineage
for
i
am
an
old
man
and
my
work
is
i
will
make
a
poem
some
day
said
the
boy
and
every
man
will
shout
when
he
hears
god
be
with
you
my
son
said
the
philosopher
and
he
embraced
the
boy
and
went
forward
on
his
journey
about
half
an
hour
s
easy
travelling
brought
him
to
a
point
from
which
he
could
see
far
down
below
to
the
pine
trees
of
coille
doraca
the
shadowy
evening
had
crept
over
the
world
ere
he
reached
the
wood
and
when
he
entered
the
little
house
the
darkness
had
already
descended
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
met
him
as
he
entered
and
was
about
to
speak
harshly
of
his
long
absence
but
the
philosopher
kissed
her
with
such
unaccustomed
tenderness
and
spoke
so
mildly
to
her
that
first
astonishment
enchained
her
tongue
and
then
delight
set
it
free
in
a
direction
to
which
it
had
long
been
a
stranger
wife
said
the
philosopher
i
can
not
say
how
joyful
i
am
to
see
your
good
face
the
thin
woman
was
unable
at
first
to
reply
to
this
salutation
but
with
incredible
speed
she
put
on
a
pot
of
stirabout
began
to
bake
a
cake
and
tried
to
roast
potatoes
after
a
little
while
she
wept
loudly
and
proclaimed
that
the
world
did
not
contain
the
equal
of
her
husband
for
comeliness
and
goodness
and
that
she
was
herself
a
sinful
person
unworthy
of
the
kindness
of
the
gods
or
of
such
a
mate
but
while
the
philosopher
was
embracing
seumas
and
brigid
beg
the
door
was
suddenly
burst
open
with
a
great
noise
four
policemen
entered
the
little
room
and
after
one
dumbfoundered
minute
they
retreated
again
bearing
the
philosopher
with
them
to
answer
a
charge
of
murder
book
the
policemen
chapter
xiv
some
distance
down
the
road
the
policemen
halted
the
night
had
fallen
before
they
effected
their
capture
and
now
in
the
gathering
darkness
they
were
not
at
ease
in
the
first
place
they
knew
that
the
occupation
upon
which
they
were
employed
was
not
a
creditable
one
to
a
man
whatever
it
might
be
to
a
policeman
the
seizure
of
a
criminal
may
be
justified
by
certain
arguments
as
to
the
health
of
society
and
the
preservation
of
property
but
no
person
wishes
under
any
circumstances
to
hale
a
wise
man
to
prison
they
were
further
distressed
by
the
knowledge
that
they
were
in
the
very
centre
of
a
populous
fairy
country
and
that
on
every
side
the
elemental
hosts
might
be
ranging
ready
to
fall
upon
them
with
the
terrors
of
war
or
the
still
more
awful
scourge
of
their
humour
the
path
leading
to
their
station
was
a
long
one
winding
through
great
alleys
of
trees
which
in
some
places
overhung
the
road
so
thickly
that
even
the
full
moon
could
not
search
out
that
deep
blackness
in
the
daylight
these
men
would
have
arrested
an
archangel
and
if
necessary
bludgeoned
him
but
in
the
a
thousand
fears
afflicted
and
a
multitude
of
sounds
shocked
them
from
every
quarter
two
men
were
holding
the
philosopher
one
on
either
side
the
other
two
walked
one
before
and
one
behind
him
in
this
order
they
were
proceeding
when
just
in
front
through
the
dim
light
they
saw
the
road
swallowed
up
by
one
of
these
groves
already
spoken
of
when
they
came
nigh
they
halted
irresolutely
the
man
who
was
in
front
a
silent
and
perturbed
sergeant
turned
fiercely
to
the
others
come
on
can
t
you
said
he
what
the
devil
are
you
waiting
for
and
he
strode
forward
into
the
black
gape
keep
a
good
hold
of
that
man
said
the
one
behind
don
t
be
talking
out
of
you
replied
he
on
the
right
haven
t
we
got
a
good
grip
of
him
and
isn
t
he
an
old
man
into
the
bargain
well
keep
a
good
tight
grip
of
him
anyhow
for
if
he
gave
you
the
slip
in
there
he
d
vanish
like
a
weasel
in
a
bush
them
old
fellows
do
be
slippery
customers
look
here
mister
said
he
to
the
philosopher
if
you
try
to
run
away
from
us
i
ll
give
you
a
clout
on
the
head
with
my
baton
do
you
mind
me
now
they
had
taken
only
a
few
paces
forward
when
the
sound
of
hasty
footsteps
brought
them
again
to
a
halt
and
in
a
moment
the
sergeant
came
striding
back
he
was
angry
are
you
going
to
stay
there
the
whole
night
or
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
all
said
he
let
you
be
quiet
now
said
another
we
were
only
settling
with
the
man
here
the
way
he
wouldn
t
try
to
give
us
the
slip
in
a
dark
is
it
thinking
of
giving
us
the
slip
he
is
said
the
sergeant
take
your
baton
in
your
hand
shawn
and
if
he
turns
his
head
to
one
side
of
him
hit
him
on
that
i
ll
do
that
said
shawn
and
he
pulled
out
his
truncheon
the
philosopher
had
been
dazed
by
the
suddenness
of
these
occurrences
and
the
enforced
rapidity
of
his
movements
prevented
him
from
either
thinking
or
speaking
but
during
this
brief
stoppage
his
scattered
wits
began
to
return
to
their
allegiance
first
bewilderment
at
his
enforcement
had
seized
him
and
the
four
men
who
were
continually
running
round
him
and
speaking
all
at
once
and
each
pulling
him
in
a
different
direction
gave
him
the
impression
that
he
was
surrounded
by
a
great
rabble
of
people
but
he
could
not
discover
what
they
wanted
after
a
time
he
found
that
there
were
only
four
men
and
gathered
from
their
remarks
that
he
was
being
arrested
for
murder
this
precipitated
him
into
another
and
a
deeper
gulf
of
bewilderment
he
was
unable
to
conceive
why
they
should
arrest
him
for
murder
when
he
had
not
committed
any
and
following
this
he
became
indignant
i
will
not
go
another
step
said
he
unless
you
tell
me
where
you
are
bringing
me
and
what
i
am
accused
tell
me
said
the
sergeant
what
did
you
kill
them
with
for
it
s
a
miracle
how
they
came
to
their
ends
without
as
much
as
a
mark
on
their
skins
or
a
broken
tooth
who
are
you
talking
about
the
philosopher
demanded
it
s
mighty
innocent
you
are
he
replied
who
would
i
be
talking
about
but
the
man
and
woman
that
used
to
be
living
with
you
beyond
in
the
little
house
is
it
poison
you
gave
them
now
or
what
was
it
take
a
hold
of
your
can
t
you
have
sense
man
said
shawn
how
would
i
be
writing
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
place
and
me
without
as
much
as
a
pencil
let
alone
a
book
well
we
ll
take
it
down
at
the
station
and
himself
can
tell
us
all
about
it
as
we
go
along
move
on
now
for
this
is
no
place
to
be
conversing
they
paced
on
again
and
in
another
moment
they
were
swallowed
up
by
the
darkness
when
they
had
proceeded
for
a
little
distance
there
came
a
peculiar
sound
in
front
like
the
breathing
of
some
enormous
animal
and
also
a
kind
of
shuffling
noise
and
so
they
again
halted
there
s
a
queer
kind
of
a
thing
in
front
of
us
said
one
of
the
men
in
a
low
voice
if
i
had
a
match
itself
said
another
the
sergeant
had
also
halted
draw
well
into
the
side
of
the
road
said
he
and
poke
your
batons
in
front
of
you
keep
a
tight
hold
of
that
man
i
ll
do
that
said
shawn
just
then
one
of
them
found
a
few
matches
in
his
pocket
and
he
struck
a
light
there
was
no
wind
so
that
it
blazed
easily
enough
and
they
all
peered
in
front
a
big
black
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
road
having
a
gentle
sleep
and
when
the
light
shone
it
scrambled
to
its
feet
and
went
thundering
away
in
a
panic
isn
t
that
enough
to
put
the
heart
crossways
in
you
said
one
of
the
men
with
a
great
sigh
ay
said
another
if
you
stepped
on
that
beast
in
the
darkness
you
wouldn
t
know
what
to
be
i
don
t
quite
remember
the
way
about
here
said
the
sergeant
after
a
while
but
i
think
we
should
take
the
first
turn
to
the
right
i
wonder
have
we
passed
the
turn
yet
these
kinds
of
roads
are
the
devil
and
it
dark
as
well
do
any
of
you
men
know
the
way
i
don
t
said
one
voice
i
m
a
cavan
man
roscommon
said
another
is
my
country
and
i
wish
i
was
there
now
so
i
well
if
we
walk
straight
on
we
re
bound
to
get
somewhere
so
step
it
out
have
you
got
a
good
hold
of
that
man
shawn
i
have
so
said
shawn
the
philosopher
s
voice
came
pealing
through
the
darkness
there
is
no
need
to
pinch
me
sir
said
he
i
m
not
pinching
you
at
all
said
the
man
you
are
so
returned
the
philosopher
you
have
a
big
lump
of
skin
doubled
up
in
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
and
unless
you
instantly
release
it
i
will
sit
down
in
the
is
that
any
better
said
the
man
relaxing
his
hold
a
little
you
have
only
let
out
half
of
it
replied
the
philosopher
that
s
better
now
he
continued
and
they
resumed
their
journey
after
a
few
minutes
of
silence
the
philosopher
began
to
speak
i
do
not
see
any
necessity
in
nature
for
policemen
said
he
nor
do
i
understand
how
the
custom
first
originated
dogs
and
cats
do
not
employ
these
extraordinary
mercenaries
and
yet
their
polity
is
progressive
and
orderly
crows
are
a
gregarious
race
with
settled
habitations
and
an
organized
commonwealth
they
usually
congregate
in
a
ruined
tower
or
on
the
top
of
a
church
and
their
civilization
is
based
on
mutual
aid
and
tolerance
for
each
other
s
idiosyncrasies
their
exceeding
mobility
and
hardiness
renders
them
dangerous
to
attack
and
thus
they
are
free
to
devote
themselves
to
the
development
of
their
domestic
laws
and
customs
if
policemen
were
necessary
to
a
civilization
crows
would
certainly
have
evolved
them
but
i
triumphantly
insist
that
they
have
not
got
any
policemen
in
their
republic
i
don
t
understand
a
word
you
are
saying
said
the
sergeant
it
doesn
t
matter
said
the
philosopher
ants
and
bees
also
live
in
specialized
communities
and
have
an
extreme
complexity
both
of
function
and
occupation
their
experience
in
governmental
matters
is
enormous
and
yet
they
have
never
discovered
that
a
police
force
is
at
all
essential
to
their
wellbeing
do
you
know
said
the
sergeant
that
whatever
you
say
now
will
be
used
in
evidence
against
you
later
on
i
do
not
said
the
philosopher
it
may
be
said
that
these
races
are
free
from
crime
that
such
vices
as
they
have
are
organized
and
communal
instead
of
individual
and
anarchistic
and
that
consequently
there
is
no
necessity
for
policecraft
but
i
can
not
believe
that
these
large
aggregations
of
people
could
have
attained
their
present
high
culture
without
an
interval
of
both
national
and
individual
dishonesty
tell
me
now
as
you
are
talking
said
the
sergeant
did
you
buy
the
poison
at
a
chemist
s
shop
or
did
you
smother
the
pair
of
them
with
a
pillow
i
did
not
said
the
philosopher
if
crime
is
a
condition
precedent
to
the
evolution
of
policemen
then
i
will
submit
that
jackdaws
are
a
very
thievish
clan
they
are
somewhat
larger
than
a
blackbird
and
will
steal
wool
off
a
sheep
s
back
to
line
their
nests
with
they
have
furthermore
been
known
to
abstract
one
shilling
in
copper
and
secrete
this
booty
so
ingeniously
that
it
has
never
since
been
recovered
i
had
a
jackdaw
myself
said
one
of
the
men
i
got
it
from
a
woman
that
came
to
the
door
with
a
basket
for
fourpence
my
mother
stood
on
its
back
one
day
and
she
getting
out
of
bed
i
split
its
tongue
with
a
threepenny
bit
the
way
it
would
talk
but
devil
the
word
it
ever
said
for
me
it
used
to
hop
around
letting
on
it
had
a
lame
leg
and
then
it
would
steal
your
shut
up
roared
the
sergeant
if
said
the
philosopher
these
people
steal
both
from
from
sheep
and
from
men
if
their
peculations
range
from
wool
to
money
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
avoid
stealing
from
each
other
and
consequently
if
anywhere
it
is
amongst
jackdaws
one
should
look
for
the
growth
of
a
police
force
but
there
is
no
such
force
in
existence
the
real
reason
is
that
they
are
a
witty
and
thoughtful
race
who
look
temperately
on
what
is
known
as
crime
and
evil
one
eats
one
steals
it
is
all
in
the
order
of
things
and
therefore
not
to
be
quarrelled
with
there
is
no
other
view
possible
to
a
philosophical
people
what
the
devil
is
he
talking
about
said
the
sergeant
monkeys
are
gregarious
and
thievish
and
they
inhabit
the
equatorial
latitudes
and
eat
nuts
do
you
know
what
he
is
saying
shawn
i
do
not
said
shawn
they
ought
to
have
evolved
professional
but
it
is
common
knowledge
that
they
have
not
done
so
fishes
squirrels
rats
beavers
and
bison
have
also
abstained
from
this
singular
growth
therefore
when
i
insist
that
i
see
no
necessity
for
policemen
and
object
to
their
presence
i
base
that
objection
on
logic
and
facts
and
not
on
any
immediate
petty
shawn
said
the
sergeant
have
you
got
a
good
grip
on
that
man
i
have
said
shawn
well
if
he
talks
any
more
hit
him
with
your
i
will
so
said
shawn
there
s
a
speck
of
light
down
yonder
and
maybe
it
s
a
candle
in
a
window
we
ll
ask
the
way
at
that
in
about
three
minutes
they
came
to
a
small
house
which
was
overhung
by
trees
if
the
light
had
not
been
visible
they
would
undoubtedly
have
passed
it
in
the
darkness
as
they
approached
the
door
the
sound
of
a
female
voice
came
to
them
scoldingly
there
s
somebody
up
anyhow
said
the
sergeant
and
he
tapped
at
the
door
the
scolding
voice
ceased
instantly
after
a
few
seconds
he
tapped
again
then
a
voice
was
heard
from
just
behind
the
door
tomas
said
the
voice
go
and
bring
up
the
two
dogs
with
you
before
i
take
the
door
off
the
the
door
was
then
opened
a
few
inches
and
a
face
peered
out
what
would
you
be
wanting
at
this
hour
of
the
night
said
the
woman
not
much
ma
am
said
the
sergeant
only
a
little
direction
about
the
road
for
we
are
not
sure
whether
we
ve
gone
too
far
or
not
far
the
woman
noticed
their
uniforms
is
it
policemen
ye
are
there
s
no
harm
in
your
coming
in
i
suppose
and
if
a
drink
of
milk
is
any
good
to
ye
i
have
plenty
of
milk
s
better
than
nothing
said
the
sergeant
with
a
sigh
i
ve
a
little
sup
of
spirits
said
she
but
it
wouldn
t
be
enough
to
go
ah
well
said
he
looking
sternly
at
his
comrades
everybody
has
to
take
their
chance
in
this
world
and
he
stepped
into
the
house
followed
by
his
men
the
women
gave
him
a
little
sup
of
whisky
from
a
bottle
and
to
each
of
the
other
men
she
gave
a
cup
of
milk
it
ll
wash
the
dust
out
of
our
gullets
anyhow
said
one
of
them
there
were
two
chairs
a
bed
and
a
table
in
the
room
the
philosopher
and
his
attendants
sat
on
the
bed
the
sergeant
sat
on
the
table
the
fourth
man
took
a
chair
and
the
woman
dropped
wearily
into
the
remaining
chair
from
which
she
looked
with
pity
at
the
prisoner
what
are
you
taking
the
poor
man
away
for
she
asked
he
s
a
bad
one
ma
am
said
the
sergeant
he
killed
a
man
and
a
woman
that
were
staying
with
him
and
he
buried
their
corpses
underneath
the
hearthstone
of
his
house
he
s
a
real
malefactor
mind
is
it
hanging
him
you
ll
be
god
help
us
you
never
know
and
i
wouldn
t
be
a
bit
surprised
if
it
came
to
that
but
you
were
in
trouble
yourself
ma
am
for
we
heard
your
voice
lamenting
about
something
as
we
came
along
the
i
was
indeed
she
replied
for
the
person
that
has
a
son
in
her
house
has
a
trouble
in
her
do
you
tell
me
now
what
did
he
do
on
you
and
the
sergeant
bent
a
look
of
grave
reprobation
on
a
young
lad
who
was
standing
against
the
wall
between
two
dogs
he
s
a
good
boy
enough
in
some
ways
said
she
but
he
s
too
fond
of
beasts
he
ll
go
and
lie
in
the
kennel
along
with
them
two
dogs
for
hours
at
a
time
petting
them
and
making
a
lot
of
them
but
if
i
try
to
give
him
a
kiss
or
to
hug
him
for
a
couple
of
minutes
when
i
do
be
tired
after
the
work
he
ll
wriggle
like
an
eel
till
i
let
him
out
it
would
make
a
body
hate
him
so
it
would
sure
there
s
no
nature
in
him
sir
and
i
m
his
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
young
whelp
said
the
sergeant
very
severely
and
then
there
s
the
horse
she
continued
maybe
you
met
it
down
the
road
a
while
ago
we
did
ma
am
said
the
sergeant
well
when
he
came
in
tomas
went
to
tie
him
up
for
he
s
a
caution
at
getting
out
and
wandering
about
the
road
the
way
you
d
break
your
neck
over
him
if
you
weren
t
minding
after
a
while
i
told
the
boy
to
come
in
but
he
didn
t
come
so
i
went
out
myself
and
there
was
himself
and
the
horse
with
their
arms
round
each
other
s
necks
looking
as
if
they
were
faith
he
s
the
queer
lad
said
the
sergeant
what
do
you
be
making
love
to
the
horse
for
tomas
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
make
him
come
in
she
continued
and
then
i
said
to
him
sit
down
alongside
of
me
here
tomas
and
keep
me
company
for
a
little
while
for
i
do
be
lonely
in
the
but
he
wouldn
t
stay
quiet
at
all
one
minute
he
d
say
mother
there
s
a
moth
flying
round
the
candle
and
it
ll
be
burnt
and
then
there
was
a
fly
going
into
the
spider
s
web
in
the
corner
and
he
d
have
to
save
it
and
after
that
there
s
a
hurting
himself
on
the
and
he
d
have
to
let
it
out
but
when
i
try
to
kiss
him
he
pushes
me
away
my
heart
is
tormented
so
it
is
for
what
have
i
in
the
world
but
him
is
his
father
dead
ma
am
said
the
sergeant
kindly
i
ll
tell
the
truth
said
she
i
don
t
know
whether
he
is
or
not
for
a
long
time
ago
when
we
used
to
live
in
the
city
of
bla
cliah
he
lost
his
work
one
time
and
he
never
came
back
to
me
again
he
was
ashamed
to
come
home
i
m
thinking
the
poor
man
because
he
had
no
money
as
if
i
would
have
minded
whether
he
had
any
money
or
not
sure
he
was
very
fond
of
me
sir
and
we
could
have
pulled
along
somehow
after
that
i
came
back
to
my
father
s
place
here
the
rest
of
the
children
died
on
me
and
then
my
father
died
and
i
m
doing
the
best
i
can
by
myself
it
s
only
that
i
m
a
little
bit
troubled
with
the
boy
now
and
it
s
a
hard
case
ma
am
said
the
sergeant
but
maybe
the
boy
is
only
a
bit
wild
not
having
his
father
over
him
and
maybe
it
s
just
that
he
s
used
to
yourself
for
there
isn
t
a
child
at
all
that
doesn
t
love
his
mother
let
you
behave
yourself
now
tomas
attend
to
your
mother
and
leave
the
beasts
and
the
insects
alone
like
a
decent
boy
for
there
s
no
insect
in
the
world
will
ever
like
you
as
well
as
she
does
could
you
tell
me
ma
am
if
we
have
passed
the
first
turn
on
this
road
or
is
it
in
front
of
us
still
for
we
are
lost
altogether
in
the
darkness
it
s
in
front
of
you
still
she
replied
about
ten
minutes
down
the
road
you
can
t
miss
it
for
you
ll
see
the
sky
where
there
is
a
gap
in
the
trees
and
that
gap
is
the
turn
you
thank
you
ma
am
said
the
sergeant
we
d
better
be
moving
on
for
there
s
a
long
tramp
in
front
of
us
before
we
get
to
sleep
this
he
stood
up
and
the
men
rose
to
follow
him
when
suddenly
the
boy
spoke
in
a
whisper
mother
said
he
they
are
going
to
hang
the
man
and
he
burst
into
tears
oh
hush
hush
said
the
woman
sure
the
men
can
t
help
she
dropped
quickly
on
her
knees
and
opened
her
arms
come
over
to
your
mother
my
the
boy
ran
to
her
they
are
going
to
hang
him
he
cried
in
a
high
thin
voice
and
he
plucked
at
her
arm
violently
now
then
my
young
said
the
sergeant
none
of
that
the
boy
turned
suddenly
and
flew
at
him
with
astonishing
ferocity
he
hurled
himself
against
the
sergeant
s
legs
and
bit
and
kicked
and
struck
at
him
so
furiously
sudden
was
his
attack
that
the
man
went
staggering
back
against
the
wall
then
he
plucked
at
the
boy
and
whirled
him
across
the
room
in
an
instant
the
two
dogs
leaped
at
him
snarling
with
rage
one
of
these
he
kicked
into
a
corner
from
which
it
rebounded
again
bristling
and
the
other
dog
was
caught
by
the
woman
and
after
a
few
frantic
seconds
she
gripped
the
first
dog
also
to
a
horrible
chorus
of
howls
and
snapping
teeth
the
men
hustled
outside
and
slammed
the
door
shawn
the
sergeant
bawled
have
you
got
a
good
grip
of
that
man
i
have
so
said
shawn
if
he
gets
away
i
ll
kick
the
belly
out
of
you
mind
that
now
come
along
with
you
and
no
more
of
your
they
marched
down
the
road
in
a
tingling
silence
dogs
said
the
philosopher
are
a
most
intelligent
race
of
people
people
my
granny
said
the
sergeant
from
the
earliest
ages
their
intelligence
has
been
observed
and
recorded
so
that
ancient
literatures
are
bulky
with
references
to
their
sagacity
and
fidelity
will
you
shut
your
old
jaw
said
the
sergeant
i
will
not
said
the
philosopher
elephants
also
are
credited
with
an
extreme
intelligence
and
devotion
to
their
masters
and
they
will
build
a
wall
or
nurse
a
baby
with
equal
skill
and
happiness
horses
have
received
high
recommendations
in
this
respect
but
crocodiles
hens
beetles
armadillos
and
fish
do
not
evince
any
remarkable
partiality
for
man
i
wish
said
the
sergeant
bitterly
that
all
them
beasts
were
stuffed
down
your
throttle
the
way
you
d
have
to
hold
your
it
doesn
t
matter
said
the
philosopher
i
do
not
know
why
these
animals
should
attach
themselves
to
men
with
gentleness
and
love
and
yet
be
able
to
preserve
intact
their
initial
bloodthirstiness
so
that
while
they
will
allow
their
masters
to
misuse
them
in
any
way
they
will
yet
fight
most
willingly
with
each
other
and
are
never
really
happy
saving
in
the
conduct
of
some
private
and
nonsensical
battle
of
their
own
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
fear
which
tames
these
creatures
into
mildness
but
that
the
most
savage
animal
has
a
capacity
for
love
which
has
not
been
sufficiently
noted
and
which
if
more
intelligent
attention
had
been
directed
upon
it
would
have
raised
them
to
the
status
of
intellectual
animals
as
against
intelligent
ones
and
perhaps
have
opened
to
us
a
correspondence
which
could
not
have
been
other
than
keep
your
eyes
out
for
that
gap
in
the
trees
shawn
said
the
sergeant
i
m
doing
that
said
shawn
the
philosopher
continued
why
can
i
not
exchange
ideas
with
a
cow
i
am
amazed
at
the
incompleteness
of
my
growth
when
i
and
a
stand
dumbly
before
each
other
without
one
glimmer
of
comprehension
locked
and
barred
from
all
friendship
and
intercourse
shawn
cried
the
sergeant
don
t
interrupt
said
the
philosopher
you
are
always
the
lower
animals
as
they
are
foolishly
called
have
abilities
at
which
we
can
only
wonder
the
mind
of
an
ant
is
one
to
which
i
would
readily
go
to
school
birds
have
atmospheric
and
levitational
information
which
millions
of
years
will
not
render
accessible
to
us
who
that
has
seen
a
spider
weaving
his
labyrinth
or
a
bee
voyaging
safely
in
the
trackless
air
can
refuse
to
credit
that
a
vivid
trained
intelligence
animates
these
small
enigmas
and
the
commonest
earthworm
is
the
heir
to
a
culture
before
which
i
bow
with
the
profoundest
veneration
shawn
said
the
sergeant
say
something
for
goodness
sake
to
take
the
sound
of
that
man
s
clack
out
of
my
i
wouldn
t
know
what
to
be
talking
about
said
shawn
for
i
never
was
much
of
a
hand
at
conversation
and
barring
my
prayers
i
got
no
education
i
think
myself
that
he
was
making
a
remark
about
a
dog
did
you
ever
own
a
dog
sergeant
you
are
doing
very
well
shawn
said
the
sergeant
keep
it
up
i
knew
a
man
had
a
dog
would
count
up
to
a
hundred
for
you
he
won
lots
of
money
in
bets
about
it
and
he
d
have
made
a
fortune
only
that
i
noticed
one
day
he
used
to
be
winking
at
the
dog
and
when
he
d
stop
winking
the
dog
would
stop
counting
we
made
him
turn
his
back
after
that
and
got
the
dog
to
count
sixpence
but
he
barked
for
more
than
five
shillings
he
did
so
and
he
would
have
counted
up
to
a
pound
maybe
only
that
his
master
turned
round
and
hit
him
a
kick
every
person
that
ever
paid
him
a
bet
said
they
wanted
their
money
back
but
the
man
went
away
to
america
in
the
night
and
i
expect
he
s
doing
well
there
for
he
took
the
dog
with
him
it
was
a
terrier
bitch
and
it
was
the
devil
for
having
it
is
astonishing
said
the
philosopher
on
what
slender
compulsion
people
will
go
to
america
keep
it
up
shawn
said
the
sergeant
you
are
doing
me
a
i
will
so
said
shawn
i
had
a
cat
one
time
and
it
used
to
have
kittens
every
two
the
philosopher
s
voice
arose
if
there
was
any
periodicity
about
these
migrations
one
could
understand
them
birds
for
example
migrate
from
their
homes
in
the
late
autumn
and
seek
abroad
the
sustenance
and
warmth
which
the
winter
would
withhold
if
they
remained
in
their
native
lands
the
salmon
also
a
dignified
fish
with
a
pink
skin
emigrates
from
the
atlantic
ocean
and
betakes
himself
inland
to
the
streams
and
lakes
where
he
recuperates
for
a
season
and
is
often
surprised
by
net
angle
or
spear
cut
in
now
shawn
said
the
sergeant
anxiously
shawn
began
to
gabble
with
amazing
speed
and
in
a
mighty
voice
cats
sometimes
eat
their
kittens
and
sometimes
they
don
t
a
cat
that
eats
its
kittens
is
a
heartless
brute
i
knew
a
cat
used
to
eat
its
kittens
it
had
four
legs
and
a
long
tail
and
it
used
to
get
the
every
time
it
had
eaten
its
kittens
i
killed
it
myself
one
day
with
a
hammer
for
i
couldn
t
stand
the
smell
it
made
so
i
couldn
t
shawn
said
the
sergeant
can
t
you
talk
about
something
else
besides
cats
and
dogs
sure
i
don
t
know
what
to
talk
about
said
shawn
i
m
sweating
this
minute
trying
to
please
you
so
i
arm
if
you
ll
tell
me
what
to
talk
about
i
ll
do
my
you
re
a
fool
said
the
sergeant
sorrowfully
you
ll
never
make
a
constable
i
m
thinking
that
i
would
sooner
listen
to
the
man
himself
than
to
you
have
you
got
a
good
hold
of
him
now
i
have
so
said
shawn
well
step
out
and
maybe
we
ll
reach
the
barracks
this
night
unless
this
is
a
road
that
there
isn
t
any
end
to
at
all
what
was
that
did
you
hear
a
noise
i
didn
t
hear
a
thing
said
shawn
i
thought
said
another
man
that
i
heard
something
moving
in
the
hedge
at
the
side
of
the
that
s
what
i
heard
said
the
sergeant
maybe
it
was
a
weasel
i
wish
to
the
devil
that
we
were
out
of
this
place
where
you
can
t
see
as
much
as
your
own
nose
now
did
you
hear
it
shawn
i
did
so
said
shawn
there
s
some
one
in
the
hedge
for
a
weasel
would
make
a
different
kind
of
a
noise
if
it
made
any
at
keep
together
men
said
the
sergeant
and
march
on
if
there
s
anybody
about
they
ve
no
business
with
he
had
scarcely
spoken
when
there
came
a
sudden
pattering
of
feet
and
immediately
the
four
men
were
surrounded
and
were
being
struck
at
on
every
side
with
sticks
and
hands
and
feet
draw
your
batons
the
sergeant
roared
keep
a
good
grip
of
that
man
i
will
so
said
shawn
stand
round
him
you
other
men
and
hit
anything
that
comes
near
there
was
no
sound
of
voices
from
the
assailants
only
a
rapid
scuffle
of
feet
the
whistle
of
sticks
as
they
swung
through
the
air
or
slapped
smartly
against
a
body
or
clashed
upon
each
other
and
the
quick
breathing
of
many
people
but
from
the
four
policemen
there
came
noise
and
to
spare
as
they
struck
wildly
on
every
side
cursing
the
darkness
and
their
opposers
with
fierce
enthusiasm
let
out
cried
shawn
suddenly
let
out
or
i
ll
smash
your
nut
for
you
there
s
some
one
pulling
at
the
prisoner
and
i
ve
dropped
my
the
truncheons
of
the
policemen
had
been
so
ferociously
exercised
that
their
antagonists
departed
as
swiftly
and
as
mysteriously
as
they
came
it
was
just
two
minutes
of
frantic
aimless
conflict
and
then
the
silent
night
was
round
them
again
without
any
sound
but
the
slow
creaking
of
branches
the
swish
of
leaves
as
they
swung
and
poised
and
the
quiet
croon
of
the
wind
along
the
road
come
on
men
said
the
sergeant
we
d
better
be
getting
out
of
this
place
as
quick
as
we
can
are
any
of
ye
hurted
i
ve
got
one
of
the
enemy
said
shawn
panting
you
ve
got
what
said
the
sergeant
i
ve
got
one
of
them
and
he
is
wriggling
like
an
eel
on
a
hold
him
tight
said
the
sergeant
excitedly
i
will
so
said
shawn
it
s
a
little
one
by
the
feel
of
it
if
one
of
ye
would
hold
the
prisoner
i
d
get
a
better
grip
on
this
one
aren
t
they
dangerous
villains
now
another
man
took
hold
of
the
philosopher
s
arm
and
shawn
got
both
hands
on
his
captive
keep
quiet
i
m
telling
you
said
he
or
i
ll
throttle
you
i
will
so
faith
it
seems
like
a
little
boy
by
the
feel
of
it
a
little
boy
said
the
sergeant
yes
he
doesn
t
reach
up
to
my
it
must
be
the
young
brat
from
the
cottage
that
set
the
dogs
on
us
the
one
that
loves
beasts
now
then
boy
what
do
you
mean
by
this
kind
of
thing
you
ll
find
yourself
in
gaol
for
this
my
young
who
was
with
you
eh
tell
me
that
now
and
the
sergeant
bent
forward
hold
up
your
head
sonny
and
talk
to
the
sergeant
said
shawn
oh
he
roared
and
suddenly
he
made
a
little
rush
forward
i
ve
got
him
he
gasped
he
nearly
got
away
it
isn
t
a
boy
at
all
sergeant
there
s
whiskers
on
it
what
do
you
say
said
the
sergeant
i
put
my
hand
under
its
chin
and
there
s
whiskers
on
it
i
nearly
let
him
out
with
the
surprise
i
did
try
again
said
the
sergeant
in
a
low
voice
you
are
making
a
i
don
t
like
touching
them
said
shawn
it
s
a
soft
whisker
like
a
s
maybe
you
d
try
yourself
sergeant
for
i
tell
you
i
m
frightened
of
hold
him
over
here
said
the
sergeant
and
keep
a
good
grip
of
i
ll
do
that
said
shawn
and
he
hauled
some
reluctant
object
towards
his
superior
the
sergeant
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
a
head
it
s
only
a
boy
s
size
to
be
sure
said
he
then
he
slid
his
hand
down
the
face
and
withdrew
it
quickly
there
are
whiskers
on
it
said
he
soberly
what
the
devil
can
it
be
i
never
met
whiskers
so
near
the
ground
before
maybe
they
are
false
ones
and
it
s
just
the
boy
yonder
trying
to
disguise
he
put
out
his
hand
again
with
an
effort
felt
his
way
to
the
chin
and
tugged
instantly
there
came
a
yell
so
loud
so
sudden
that
every
man
of
them
jumped
in
a
panic
they
are
real
whiskers
said
the
sergeant
with
a
sigh
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
is
his
voice
is
big
enough
for
two
men
and
that
s
a
fact
have
you
got
another
match
on
you
i
have
two
more
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
said
one
of
the
men
give
me
one
of
them
said
the
sergeant
i
ll
strike
it
he
groped
about
until
he
found
the
hand
with
the
match
be
sure
and
hold
him
tight
shawn
the
way
we
can
have
a
good
look
at
him
for
this
is
like
to
be
a
queer
miracle
of
a
i
m
holding
him
by
the
two
arms
said
shawn
he
can
t
stir
anything
but
his
head
and
i
ve
got
my
chest
on
the
sergeant
struck
the
match
shading
it
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
then
he
turned
it
on
their
new
prisoner
they
saw
a
little
man
dressed
in
tight
green
clothes
he
had
a
broad
pale
face
with
staring
eyes
and
there
was
a
thin
fringe
of
grey
whisker
under
his
chin
then
the
match
went
out
it
s
a
leprecaun
said
the
sergeant
the
men
were
silent
for
a
full
couple
of
last
shawn
spoke
do
you
tell
me
so
said
he
in
a
musing
voice
that
s
a
queer
miracle
i
do
said
the
sergeant
doesn
t
it
stand
to
reason
that
it
can
t
be
anything
else
you
saw
it
shawn
plumped
down
on
his
knees
before
his
captive
tell
me
where
the
money
is
he
hissed
tell
me
where
the
money
is
or
i
ll
twist
your
neck
the
other
men
also
gathered
eagerly
around
shouting
threats
and
commands
at
the
leprecaun
hold
your
whist
said
shawn
fiercely
to
them
he
can
t
answer
the
lot
of
you
can
he
and
he
turned
again
to
the
leprecaun
and
shook
him
until
his
teeth
chattered
if
you
don
t
tell
me
where
the
money
is
at
once
i
ll
kill
you
i
will
i
haven
t
got
any
money
at
all
sir
said
the
leprecaun
none
of
your
lies
roared
shawn
tell
the
truth
now
or
it
ll
be
worse
for
i
haven
t
got
any
money
said
the
leprecaun
for
meehawl
macmurrachu
of
the
hill
stole
our
crock
a
while
back
and
he
buried
it
under
a
thorn
bush
i
can
bring
you
to
the
place
if
you
don
t
believe
very
good
said
shawn
come
on
with
me
now
and
i
ll
clout
you
if
you
as
much
as
wriggle
do
you
mind
me
what
would
i
wriggle
for
said
the
leprecaun
sure
i
like
being
with
hereupon
the
sergeant
roared
at
the
top
of
his
voice
attention
said
he
and
the
men
leaped
to
position
like
automata
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
do
with
your
prisoner
shawn
said
he
sarcastically
don
t
you
think
we
ve
had
enough
tramping
of
these
roads
for
one
night
now
bring
up
that
leprecaun
to
the
barracks
or
it
ll
be
the
worse
for
you
do
you
hear
me
talking
to
you
but
the
gold
sergeant
said
shawn
sulkily
if
there
s
any
gold
it
ll
be
treasure
trove
and
belong
to
the
crown
what
kind
of
a
constable
are
you
at
all
shawn
mind
what
you
are
about
now
my
man
and
no
back
answers
step
along
there
bring
that
murderer
up
at
once
whichever
of
you
has
there
came
a
gasp
from
the
darkness
oh
oh
oh
said
a
voice
of
horror
what
s
wrong
with
you
said
the
sergeant
are
you
hurted
the
prisoner
he
gasped
he
he
s
got
away
got
away
and
the
sergeant
s
voice
was
a
blare
of
fury
while
we
were
looking
at
the
leprecaun
said
the
voice
of
woe
i
must
have
forgotten
about
the
other
one
i
i
haven
t
got
him
you
gawm
gritted
the
sergeant
is
it
my
prisoner
that
s
gone
said
shawn
in
a
deep
voice
he
leaped
forward
with
a
curse
and
smote
his
negligent
comrade
so
terrible
a
blow
in
the
face
that
the
man
went
flying
backwards
and
the
thud
of
his
head
on
the
road
could
have
been
heard
anywhere
get
up
said
shawn
get
up
till
i
give
you
another
that
will
do
said
the
sergeant
we
ll
go
home
we
re
the
of
the
world
i
ll
pay
you
out
for
this
some
time
every
damn
man
of
ye
bring
that
leprecaun
along
with
you
and
quick
oh
said
shawn
in
a
strangled
tone
what
is
it
now
said
the
sergeant
testily
nothing
replied
shawn
what
did
you
say
oh
for
then
you
it
s
the
leprecaun
sergeant
said
shawn
in
a
whisper
he
s
got
away
when
i
was
hitting
the
man
there
i
forgot
all
about
the
leprecaun
he
must
have
run
into
the
hedge
oh
sergeant
dear
don
t
say
anything
to
me
now
quick
march
said
the
sergeant
and
the
four
men
moved
on
through
the
darkness
in
a
silence
which
was
only
skin
deep
chapter
xv
by
reason
of
the
many
years
which
he
had
spent
in
the
gloomy
pine
wood
the
philosopher
could
see
a
little
in
the
darkness
and
when
he
found
there
was
no
longer
any
hold
on
his
coat
he
continued
his
journey
quietly
marching
along
with
his
head
sunken
on
his
breast
in
a
deep
abstraction
he
was
meditating
on
the
word
me
and
endeavouring
to
pursue
it
through
all
its
changes
and
adventures
the
fact
of
was
one
which
startled
him
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
being
he
knew
that
the
hand
which
he
held
up
and
pinched
with
another
hand
was
not
him
and
the
endeavour
to
find
out
what
was
him
was
one
which
had
frequently
exercised
his
leisure
he
had
not
gone
far
when
there
came
a
tug
at
his
sleeve
and
looking
down
he
found
one
of
the
leprecauns
of
the
gort
trotting
by
his
side
noble
sir
said
the
leprecaun
you
are
terrible
hard
to
get
into
conversation
with
i
have
been
talking
to
you
for
the
last
long
time
and
you
won
t
i
am
listening
now
replied
the
philosopher
you
are
indeed
said
the
leprecaun
heartily
my
brothers
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
over
there
beyond
the
hedge
and
they
want
to
talk
to
you
will
you
come
with
me
noble
sir
why
wouldn
t
i
go
with
you
said
the
philosopher
and
he
turned
aside
with
the
leprecaun
they
pushed
softly
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
and
into
a
field
beyond
come
this
way
sir
said
his
guide
and
the
philosopher
followed
him
across
the
field
in
a
few
minutes
they
came
to
a
thick
bush
among
the
leaves
of
which
the
other
leprecauns
were
hiding
they
thronged
out
to
meet
the
philosopher
s
approach
and
welcomed
him
with
every
appearance
of
joy
with
them
was
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
who
embraced
her
husband
tenderly
and
gave
thanks
for
his
escape
the
night
is
young
yet
remarked
one
of
the
leprecauns
let
us
sit
down
here
and
talk
about
what
should
be
i
am
tired
enough
said
the
philosopher
for
i
have
been
travelling
all
yesterday
and
all
this
day
and
the
whole
of
this
night
i
have
been
going
also
so
i
would
be
glad
to
sit
down
they
sat
down
under
the
bush
and
the
philosopher
lit
his
pipe
in
the
open
space
where
they
were
there
was
just
light
enough
to
see
the
smoke
coming
from
his
pipe
but
scarcely
more
one
recognized
a
figure
as
a
deeper
shadow
than
the
surrounding
darkness
but
as
the
ground
was
dry
and
the
air
just
touched
with
a
pleasant
chill
there
was
no
discomfort
after
the
philosopher
had
drawn
a
few
mouthfuls
of
smoke
he
passed
his
pipe
on
to
the
next
person
and
in
this
way
his
pipe
made
the
circuit
of
the
party
when
i
put
the
children
to
bed
said
the
thin
woman
i
came
down
the
road
in
your
wake
with
a
basin
of
stirabout
for
you
had
no
time
to
take
your
food
god
help
you
and
i
was
thinking
you
must
have
been
that
is
so
said
the
philosopher
in
a
very
anxious
voice
but
i
don
t
blame
you
my
dear
for
letting
the
basin
fall
on
the
road
while
i
was
going
along
she
continued
i
met
these
good
people
and
when
i
told
them
what
happened
they
came
with
me
to
see
if
anything
could
be
done
the
time
they
ran
out
of
the
hedge
to
fight
the
policemen
i
wanted
to
go
with
them
but
i
was
afraid
the
stirabout
would
be
the
philosopher
licked
his
lips
i
am
listening
to
you
my
love
said
he
so
i
had
to
stay
where
i
was
with
the
stirabout
under
my
shawl
did
you
slip
then
dear
wife
i
did
not
indeed
she
replied
i
have
the
stirabout
with
me
this
minute
it
s
rather
cold
i
m
thinking
but
it
is
better
than
nothing
at
all
and
she
placed
the
bowl
in
his
hands
i
put
sugar
in
it
said
she
shyly
and
currants
and
i
have
a
spoon
in
my
it
tastes
well
said
the
philosopher
and
he
cleaned
the
basin
so
speedily
that
his
wife
wept
because
of
his
hunger
by
this
time
the
pipe
had
come
round
to
him
again
and
it
was
welcomed
now
we
can
talk
said
he
and
he
blew
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
darkness
and
sighed
happily
we
were
thinking
said
the
thin
woman
that
you
won
t
be
able
to
come
back
to
our
house
for
a
while
yet
the
policemen
will
be
peeping
about
coille
doraca
for
a
long
time
to
be
sure
for
isn
t
it
true
that
if
there
is
a
good
thing
coming
to
a
person
nobody
takes
much
trouble
to
find
him
but
if
there
is
a
bad
thing
or
a
punishment
in
store
for
a
man
then
the
whole
world
will
be
searched
until
he
be
found
it
is
a
true
statement
said
the
philosopher
so
what
we
arranged
was
this
that
you
should
go
to
live
with
these
little
men
in
their
house
under
the
yew
tree
of
the
gort
there
is
not
a
policeman
in
the
world
would
find
you
there
or
if
you
went
by
night
to
the
brugh
of
the
boyne
angus
og
himself
would
give
you
a
one
of
the
leprecauns
here
interposed
noble
sir
said
he
there
isn
t
much
room
in
our
house
but
there
s
no
stint
of
welcome
in
it
you
would
have
a
good
time
with
us
travelling
on
moonlit
nights
and
seeing
strange
things
for
we
often
go
to
visit
the
shee
of
the
hills
and
they
come
to
see
us
there
is
always
something
to
talk
about
and
we
have
dances
in
the
caves
and
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
don
t
be
imagining
now
that
we
have
a
poor
life
for
there
is
fun
and
plenty
with
us
and
the
brugh
of
angus
mac
an
og
is
hard
to
be
got
i
would
like
to
dance
indeed
returned
the
philosopher
for
i
do
believe
that
dancing
is
the
first
and
last
duty
of
man
if
we
can
not
be
gay
what
can
we
be
life
is
not
any
use
at
all
unless
we
find
a
laugh
here
and
there
but
this
time
decent
men
of
the
gort
i
can
not
go
with
you
for
it
is
laid
on
me
to
give
myself
up
to
the
you
would
not
do
that
exclaimed
the
thin
woman
pitifully
you
wouldn
t
think
of
doing
that
now
an
innocent
man
said
he
can
not
be
oppressed
for
he
is
fortified
by
his
mind
and
his
heart
cheers
him
it
is
only
on
a
guilty
person
that
the
rigour
of
punishment
can
fall
for
he
punishes
himself
this
is
what
i
think
that
a
man
should
always
obey
the
law
with
his
body
and
always
disobey
it
with
his
mind
i
have
been
arrested
the
men
of
the
law
had
me
in
their
hands
and
i
will
have
to
go
back
to
them
so
that
they
may
do
whatever
they
have
to
the
philosopher
resumed
his
pipe
and
although
the
others
reasoned
with
him
for
a
long
time
they
could
not
by
any
means
remove
him
from
his
purpose
so
when
the
pale
glimmer
of
dawn
had
stolen
over
the
sky
they
arose
and
went
downwards
to
the
and
so
to
the
police
station
outside
the
village
the
leprecauns
bade
him
farewell
and
the
thin
woman
also
took
her
leave
of
him
saying
she
would
visit
angus
og
and
implore
his
assistance
on
behalf
of
her
husband
and
then
the
leprecauns
and
the
thin
woman
returned
again
the
way
they
came
and
the
philosopher
walked
on
to
the
barracks
chapter
xvi
when
he
knocked
at
the
barracks
door
it
was
opened
by
a
man
with
tousled
red
hair
who
looked
as
though
he
had
just
awakened
from
sleep
what
do
you
want
at
this
hour
of
the
night
said
he
i
want
to
give
myself
up
said
the
philosopher
the
policeman
looked
at
him
a
man
as
old
as
you
are
said
he
oughtn
t
to
be
a
fool
go
home
now
i
advise
you
and
don
t
say
a
word
to
any
one
whether
you
did
it
or
not
tell
me
this
now
was
it
found
out
or
are
you
only
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
sure
i
must
give
myself
up
said
the
philosopher
if
you
must
you
must
and
that
s
an
end
of
it
wipe
your
feet
on
the
rail
there
and
come
in
i
ll
take
your
i
have
no
deposition
for
you
said
the
philosopher
for
i
didn
t
do
a
thing
at
the
policeman
stared
at
him
again
if
that
s
so
said
he
you
needn
t
come
in
at
all
and
you
needn
t
have
wakened
me
out
of
my
sleep
either
maybe
tho
you
are
the
man
that
fought
the
badger
on
the
naas
road
eh
i
am
not
replied
the
philosopher
but
i
was
arrested
for
killing
my
brother
and
his
wife
although
i
never
touched
is
that
who
you
are
said
the
policeman
and
then
briskly
you
re
as
welcome
as
the
cuckoo
you
are
so
come
in
and
make
yourself
comfortable
till
the
men
awaken
and
they
are
the
lads
that
ll
be
glad
to
see
you
i
couldn
t
make
head
or
tail
of
what
they
said
when
they
came
in
last
night
and
no
one
else
either
for
they
did
nothing
but
fight
each
other
and
curse
the
banshees
and
cluricauns
of
leinster
sit
down
there
on
the
settle
by
the
fire
and
maybe
you
ll
be
able
to
get
a
sleep
you
look
as
if
you
were
tired
and
the
mud
of
every
county
in
ireland
is
on
your
the
philosopher
thanked
him
and
stretched
out
on
the
settle
in
a
short
time
for
he
was
very
weary
he
fell
asleep
many
hours
later
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
found
on
rising
that
the
men
who
had
captured
him
on
the
previous
evening
were
standing
by
the
bed
the
sergeant
s
face
beamed
with
joy
he
was
dressed
only
in
his
trousers
and
shirt
his
hair
was
sticking
up
in
some
places
and
sticking
out
in
others
which
gave
a
certain
wild
look
to
him
and
his
feet
were
bare
he
took
the
philosopher
s
two
hands
in
his
own
and
swore
if
ever
there
was
anything
he
could
do
to
comfort
him
he
would
do
that
and
more
shawn
in
a
similar
state
of
unclothedness
greeted
the
philosopher
and
proclaimed
himself
his
friend
and
follower
for
ever
shawn
further
announced
that
he
did
not
believe
the
philosopher
had
killed
the
two
people
that
if
he
had
killed
them
they
must
have
richly
deserved
it
and
that
if
he
was
hung
he
would
plant
flowers
on
his
grave
for
a
decenter
quieter
and
wiser
man
he
had
never
met
and
never
would
meet
in
the
world
these
professions
of
esteem
comforted
the
philosopher
and
he
replied
to
them
in
terms
which
made
the
policeman
gape
in
astonishment
and
approval
he
was
given
a
breakfast
of
bread
and
cocoa
which
he
ate
with
his
guardians
and
then
as
they
had
to
take
up
their
outdoor
duties
he
was
conducted
to
the
backyard
and
informed
he
could
walk
about
there
and
that
he
might
smoke
until
he
was
black
in
the
face
the
policemen
severally
presented
him
with
a
pipe
a
tin
of
tobacco
two
boxes
of
matches
and
a
dictionary
and
then
they
withdrew
leaving
him
to
his
own
devices
the
garden
was
about
twelve
feet
square
having
high
smooth
walls
on
every
side
and
into
it
there
came
neither
sun
nor
wind
in
one
corner
a
clump
of
was
climbing
up
the
wall
every
leaf
of
this
plant
was
riddled
with
holes
and
there
were
no
flowers
on
it
another
corner
was
occupied
by
dwarf
nasturtiums
and
on
this
plant
in
despite
of
every
discouragement
two
flowers
were
blooming
but
its
leaves
also
were
tattered
and
dejected
a
mass
of
ivy
clung
to
the
third
corner
its
leaves
were
big
and
glossy
at
the
top
but
near
the
ground
there
was
only
grey
naked
stalks
laced
together
by
cobwebs
the
fourth
wall
was
clothed
in
a
loose
virginia
creeper
every
leaf
of
which
looked
like
an
insect
that
could
crawl
if
it
wanted
to
the
centre
of
this
small
plot
had
used
every
possible
artifice
to
cover
itself
with
grass
and
in
some
places
it
had
wonderfully
succeeded
but
the
pieces
of
broken
bottles
shattered
jampots
and
sections
of
crockery
were
so
numerous
that
no
attempt
at
growth
could
be
other
than
tentative
and
unpassioned
here
for
a
long
time
the
philosopher
marched
up
and
down
at
one
moment
he
examined
the
and
mourned
with
it
on
a
wretched
existence
again
he
congratulated
the
nasturtium
on
its
two
bright
children
but
he
thought
of
the
gardens
wherein
they
might
have
bloomed
and
the
remembrance
of
that
spacious
sunny
freedom
saddened
him
indeed
poor
creatures
said
he
ye
also
are
in
the
blank
soundless
yard
troubled
him
so
much
that
at
last
he
called
to
the
policeman
and
begged
to
be
put
into
a
cell
in
preference
and
to
the
common
cell
he
was
accordingly
conducted
this
place
was
a
small
cellar
built
beneath
the
level
of
the
ground
an
iron
grating
at
the
top
of
the
wall
admitted
one
blanched
wink
of
light
but
the
place
was
bathed
in
obscurity
a
wooden
ladder
led
down
to
the
cell
from
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
this
hole
also
gave
a
spark
of
brightness
and
some
little
air
to
the
room
the
walls
were
of
stone
covered
with
plaster
but
the
plaster
had
fallen
away
in
many
places
leaving
the
rough
stones
visible
at
every
turn
of
the
eye
there
were
two
men
in
the
cell
and
these
the
philosopher
saluted
but
they
did
not
reply
nor
did
they
speak
to
each
other
there
was
a
low
wooden
form
fixed
to
the
wall
running
quite
round
the
room
and
on
this
far
apart
from
each
other
the
two
men
were
seated
with
their
elbows
resting
on
their
knees
their
heads
propped
upon
their
hands
and
each
of
them
with
an
unwavering
gaze
fixed
on
the
floor
between
his
feet
the
philosopher
walked
for
a
time
up
and
down
the
little
cell
but
soon
he
also
sat
down
on
the
low
form
propped
his
head
on
his
hands
and
lapsed
to
a
melancholy
dream
so
the
day
passed
twice
a
policeman
came
down
the
ladder
bearing
three
portions
of
food
bread
and
cocoa
and
by
imperceptible
gradations
the
light
faded
away
from
the
grating
and
the
darkness
came
after
a
great
interval
the
policeman
again
approached
carrying
three
mattresses
and
three
rough
blankets
and
these
he
bundled
through
the
hole
each
of
the
men
took
a
mattress
and
a
blanket
and
spread
them
on
the
floor
and
the
philosopher
took
his
share
also
by
this
time
they
could
not
see
each
other
and
all
their
operations
were
conducted
by
the
sense
of
touch
alone
they
laid
themselves
down
on
the
beds
and
a
terrible
dark
silence
brooded
over
the
room
but
the
philosopher
could
not
sleep
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
for
the
darkness
under
his
eyelids
was
not
so
dense
as
that
which
surrounded
him
indeed
he
could
at
will
illuminate
his
own
darkness
and
order
around
him
the
sunny
roads
or
the
sparkling
sky
while
his
eyes
were
closed
he
had
the
mastery
of
all
pictures
of
light
and
colour
and
warmth
but
an
irresistible
fascination
compelled
him
every
few
minutes
to
reopen
them
and
in
the
sad
space
around
he
could
not
create
any
happiness
the
darkness
weighed
very
sadly
upon
him
so
that
in
a
short
time
it
did
creep
under
his
eyelids
and
drowned
his
happy
pictures
until
a
blackness
possessed
him
both
within
and
without
can
one
s
mind
go
to
prison
as
well
as
one
s
body
said
he
he
strove
desperately
to
regain
his
intellectual
freedom
but
he
could
not
he
could
conjure
up
no
visions
but
those
of
fear
the
creatures
of
the
dark
invaded
him
fantastic
terrors
were
thronging
on
every
side
they
came
from
the
darkness
into
his
eyes
and
beyond
into
himself
so
that
his
mind
as
well
as
his
fancy
was
captured
and
he
knew
he
was
indeed
in
gaol
it
was
with
a
great
start
that
he
heard
a
voice
speaking
from
the
silence
a
harsh
yet
cultivated
voice
but
he
could
not
imagine
which
of
his
companions
was
speaking
he
had
a
vision
of
that
man
tormented
by
the
mental
imprisonment
of
the
darkness
trying
to
get
away
from
his
ghosts
and
slimy
enemies
goaded
into
speech
in
his
own
despite
lest
he
should
be
submerged
and
finally
possessed
by
the
abysmal
demons
for
a
while
the
voice
spoke
of
the
strangeness
of
life
and
the
cruelty
of
men
to
each
other
disconnected
sentences
odd
words
of
selfpity
and
and
then
the
matter
became
more
connected
and
a
story
grew
in
the
dark
cell
i
knew
a
man
said
the
voice
and
he
was
a
clerk
he
had
thirty
shillings
a
week
and
for
five
years
he
had
never
missed
a
day
going
to
his
work
he
was
a
careful
man
but
a
person
with
a
wife
and
four
children
can
not
save
much
out
of
thirty
shillings
a
week
the
rent
of
a
house
is
high
a
wife
and
children
must
be
fed
and
they
have
to
get
boots
and
clothes
so
that
at
the
end
of
each
week
that
man
s
thirty
shillings
used
to
be
all
gone
but
they
managed
to
get
along
somehow
the
man
and
his
wife
and
the
four
children
were
fed
and
clothed
and
educated
and
the
man
often
wondered
how
so
much
could
be
done
with
so
little
money
but
the
reason
was
that
his
wife
was
a
careful
woman
and
then
the
man
got
sick
a
poor
person
can
not
afford
to
get
sick
and
a
married
man
can
not
leave
his
work
if
he
is
sick
he
has
to
be
sick
but
he
must
go
to
his
work
all
the
same
for
if
he
stayed
away
who
would
pay
the
wages
and
feed
his
family
and
when
he
went
back
to
work
he
might
find
that
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
this
man
fell
sick
but
he
made
no
change
in
his
way
of
life
he
got
up
at
the
same
time
and
went
to
the
office
as
usual
and
he
got
through
the
day
somehow
without
attracting
his
employer
s
attention
he
didn
t
know
what
was
wrong
with
him
he
only
knew
that
he
was
sick
sometimes
he
had
sharp
swift
pains
in
his
head
and
again
there
would
be
long
hours
of
languor
when
he
could
scarcely
bear
to
change
his
position
or
lift
a
pen
he
would
commence
a
letter
with
the
words
dear
sir
forming
the
letter
d
with
painful
accurate
slowness
elaborating
and
thickening
the
up
and
down
strokes
and
being
troubled
when
he
had
to
leave
that
letter
for
the
next
one
he
built
the
next
letter
by
hair
strokes
and
would
start
on
the
third
with
hatred
the
end
of
a
word
seemed
to
that
man
like
the
conclusion
of
an
event
it
was
a
surprising
isolated
individual
thing
having
no
reference
to
anything
else
in
the
world
and
on
starting
a
new
word
he
seemed
bound
in
order
to
preserve
its
individuality
to
write
it
in
a
different
handwriting
he
would
sit
with
his
shoulders
hunched
up
and
his
pen
resting
on
the
paper
staring
at
a
letter
until
he
was
nearly
mesmerized
and
then
come
to
himself
with
a
sense
of
fear
which
started
him
working
like
a
madman
so
that
he
might
not
be
behind
with
his
business
the
day
seemed
to
be
so
long
it
rolled
on
rusty
hinges
that
could
scarcely
move
each
hour
was
like
a
great
circle
swollen
with
heavy
air
and
it
droned
and
buzzed
into
an
eternity
it
seemed
to
the
man
that
his
hand
in
particular
wanted
to
rest
it
was
luxury
not
to
work
with
it
it
was
good
to
lay
it
down
on
a
sheet
of
paper
with
the
pen
sloping
against
his
finger
and
then
watch
his
hand
going
to
sleep
it
seemed
to
the
man
that
it
was
his
hand
and
not
himself
wanted
to
sleep
but
it
always
awakened
when
the
pen
slipped
there
was
an
instinct
in
him
somewhere
not
to
let
the
pen
slip
and
every
time
the
pen
moved
his
hand
awakened
and
began
to
work
languidly
when
he
went
home
at
night
he
lay
down
at
once
and
stared
for
hours
at
a
fly
on
the
wall
or
a
crack
on
the
ceiling
when
his
wife
spoke
to
him
he
heard
her
speaking
as
from
a
great
distance
and
he
answered
her
dully
as
though
he
was
replying
through
a
cloud
he
only
wanted
to
be
let
alone
to
be
allowed
to
stare
at
the
fly
on
the
wall
or
the
crack
on
the
ceiling
one
morning
he
found
that
he
couldn
t
get
up
or
rather
that
he
didn
t
want
to
get
up
when
his
wife
called
him
he
made
no
reply
and
she
seemed
to
call
him
every
ten
seconds
the
words
get
up
get
up
were
crackling
all
round
him
they
were
bursting
like
bombs
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
of
him
they
were
scattering
from
above
and
all
around
him
bursting
upwards
from
the
floor
swirling
swaying
and
jostling
each
other
then
the
sounds
ceased
and
one
voice
only
said
to
him
you
are
late
he
saw
these
words
like
a
blur
hanging
in
the
air
just
beyond
his
eyelids
and
he
stared
at
the
blur
until
he
fell
the
voice
in
the
cell
ceased
speaking
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
it
went
on
again
for
three
weeks
the
man
did
not
leave
his
bed
he
lived
faintly
in
a
kind
of
trance
wherein
great
forms
moved
about
slowly
and
immense
words
were
drumming
gently
for
ever
when
he
began
to
take
notice
again
everything
in
the
house
was
different
most
of
the
furniture
paid
for
so
hardly
was
gone
he
missed
a
thing
everywhere
chairs
a
mirror
a
table
wherever
he
looked
he
missed
something
and
downstairs
was
worse
there
everything
was
gone
his
wife
had
sold
all
her
furniture
to
pay
for
doctors
for
medicine
for
food
and
rent
and
she
was
changed
too
good
things
had
gone
from
her
face
she
was
gaunt
miserable
but
she
was
comforted
to
think
he
was
going
back
to
work
soon
there
was
a
flurry
in
his
head
when
he
went
to
his
office
he
didn
t
know
what
his
employer
would
say
for
stopping
away
he
might
blame
him
for
being
sick
he
wondered
would
his
employer
pay
him
for
the
weeks
he
was
absent
when
he
stood
at
the
door
he
was
frightened
suddenly
the
thought
of
his
master
s
eye
grew
terrible
to
him
it
was
a
steady
cold
glassy
eye
but
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
his
master
was
there
with
another
man
and
he
tried
to
say
good
morning
sir
in
a
natural
and
calm
voice
but
he
knew
that
the
strange
man
had
been
engaged
instead
of
himself
and
this
knowledge
posted
itself
between
his
tongue
and
his
thought
he
heard
himself
stammering
he
felt
that
his
whole
bearing
had
become
drooping
and
abject
his
master
was
talking
swiftly
and
the
other
man
was
looking
at
him
in
an
embarrassed
stealthy
and
pleading
manner
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
apologising
for
having
supplanted
him
so
he
mumbled
good
day
sir
and
stumbled
out
when
he
got
outside
he
could
not
think
where
to
go
after
a
while
he
went
in
the
direction
of
the
little
park
in
the
centre
of
the
city
it
was
quite
near
and
he
sat
down
on
an
iron
bench
facing
a
pond
there
were
children
walking
up
and
down
by
the
water
giving
pieces
of
bread
to
the
swans
now
and
again
a
labouring
man
or
a
messenger
went
by
quickly
now
and
again
a
middleaged
man
drooped
past
aimlessly
sometimes
a
tattered
woman
with
a
badgered
face
flopped
by
him
when
he
looked
at
these
dull
people
the
thought
came
to
him
that
they
were
not
walking
there
at
all
they
were
trailing
through
hell
and
their
desperate
eyes
saw
none
but
devils
around
them
he
saw
himself
joining
these
battered
strollers
and
he
could
not
think
what
he
would
tell
his
wife
when
he
went
home
he
rehearsed
to
himself
the
terms
of
his
dismissal
a
hundred
times
how
his
master
looked
what
he
had
said
and
then
the
fine
ironical
things
he
had
said
to
his
master
he
sat
in
the
park
all
day
and
when
evening
fell
he
went
home
at
his
accustomed
hour
his
wife
asked
him
questions
as
to
how
he
had
got
on
and
wanted
to
know
was
there
any
chance
of
being
paid
for
the
weeks
of
absence
the
man
answered
her
volubly
ate
his
supper
and
went
to
bed
but
he
did
not
tell
his
wife
that
he
had
been
dismissed
and
that
there
would
be
no
money
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
tried
to
tell
her
but
when
he
met
her
eye
he
found
that
he
could
not
say
the
words
he
was
afraid
of
the
look
that
might
come
into
her
face
when
she
heard
it
she
standing
terrified
in
those
dismantled
rooms
in
the
morning
he
ate
his
breakfast
and
went
out
again
to
work
his
wife
thought
she
bid
him
ask
the
master
about
the
three
weeks
wages
or
to
try
and
get
an
advance
on
the
present
week
s
wages
for
they
were
hardly
put
to
it
to
buy
food
he
said
he
would
do
his
best
but
he
went
straight
to
the
park
and
sat
looking
at
the
pond
looking
at
the
and
dreaming
in
the
middle
of
the
day
he
started
up
in
a
panic
and
went
about
the
city
asking
for
work
in
offices
shops
warehouses
everywhere
but
he
could
not
get
any
he
trailed
back
again
to
the
park
and
sat
down
he
told
his
wife
more
lies
about
his
work
that
night
and
what
his
master
had
said
when
he
asked
for
an
advance
he
couldn
t
bear
the
children
to
touch
him
after
a
little
time
he
sneaked
away
to
his
bed
a
week
went
that
way
he
didn
t
look
for
work
any
more
he
sat
in
the
park
dreaming
with
his
head
bowed
into
his
hands
the
next
day
would
be
the
day
he
should
have
been
paid
his
wages
the
next
day
what
would
his
wife
say
when
he
told
her
he
had
no
money
she
would
stare
at
him
and
flush
and
didn
t
you
go
out
every
day
to
work
how
would
he
tell
her
then
so
that
she
could
understand
quickly
and
spare
him
words
morning
came
and
the
man
ate
his
breakfast
silently
there
was
no
butter
on
the
bread
and
his
wife
seemed
to
be
apologising
to
him
for
not
having
any
she
said
we
ll
be
able
to
start
fair
from
and
when
he
snapped
at
her
angrily
she
thought
it
was
because
he
had
to
eat
dry
bread
he
went
to
the
park
and
sat
there
for
hours
now
and
again
he
got
up
and
walked
into
a
neighbouring
street
but
always
after
half
an
hour
or
so
he
came
back
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
was
his
hour
for
going
home
when
six
o
clock
came
he
did
not
move
he
still
sat
opposite
the
pond
with
his
head
bowed
down
into
his
arms
seven
o
clock
passed
at
nine
o
clock
a
bell
was
rung
and
every
one
had
to
leave
he
went
also
he
stood
outside
the
gates
looking
on
this
side
and
on
that
which
way
would
he
go
all
roads
were
alike
to
him
so
he
turned
at
last
and
walked
somewhere
he
did
not
go
home
that
night
he
never
went
home
again
he
never
was
heard
of
again
anywhere
in
the
wide
the
voice
ceased
speaking
and
silence
swung
down
again
upon
the
little
cell
the
philosopher
had
been
listening
intently
to
this
story
and
after
a
few
minutes
he
spoke
when
you
go
up
this
road
there
is
a
turn
to
the
left
and
all
the
path
along
is
bordered
with
trees
there
are
birds
in
the
trees
glory
be
to
god
there
is
only
one
house
on
that
road
and
the
woman
in
it
gave
us
milk
to
drink
she
has
but
one
son
a
good
boy
and
she
said
the
other
children
were
dead
she
was
speaking
of
a
husband
who
went
away
and
left
her
why
should
he
have
been
afraid
to
come
home
said
she
sure
i
loved
after
a
little
interval
the
voice
spoke
again
i
don
t
know
what
became
of
the
man
i
was
speaking
of
i
am
a
thief
and
i
m
well
known
to
the
police
everywhere
i
don
t
think
that
man
would
get
a
welcome
at
the
house
up
here
for
why
should
he
another
a
different
querulous
kind
of
voice
came
from
the
silence
if
i
knew
a
place
where
there
was
a
welcome
i
d
go
there
as
quickly
as
i
could
but
i
don
t
know
a
place
and
i
never
will
for
what
good
would
a
man
of
my
age
be
to
any
person
i
am
a
thief
also
the
first
thing
i
stole
was
a
hen
out
of
a
little
yard
i
roasted
it
in
a
ditch
and
ate
it
and
then
i
stole
another
one
and
ate
it
and
after
that
i
stole
everything
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
i
suppose
i
will
steal
as
long
as
i
live
and
i
ll
die
in
a
ditch
at
the
heel
of
the
hunt
there
was
a
time
not
long
ago
and
if
any
one
had
told
me
then
that
i
would
rob
even
for
hunger
i
d
have
been
insulted
but
what
does
it
matter
now
and
the
reason
i
am
a
thief
is
because
i
got
old
without
noticing
it
other
people
noticed
it
but
i
did
not
i
suppose
age
comes
on
one
so
gradually
that
it
is
seldom
observed
if
there
are
wrinkles
on
one
s
face
we
do
not
remember
when
they
were
not
there
we
put
down
all
kind
of
little
infirmities
to
sedentary
living
and
you
will
see
plenty
of
young
people
bald
if
a
man
has
no
occasion
to
tell
any
one
his
age
and
if
he
never
thinks
of
it
himself
he
won
t
see
ten
years
difference
between
his
youth
and
his
age
for
we
live
in
slow
quiet
times
and
nothing
ever
happens
to
mark
the
years
as
they
go
by
one
after
the
other
and
all
the
same
i
lodged
in
a
house
for
a
great
many
years
and
a
little
girl
grew
up
there
the
daughter
of
my
landlady
she
used
to
slide
down
the
bannisters
very
well
and
she
used
to
play
the
piano
very
badly
these
two
things
worried
me
many
a
time
she
used
to
bring
me
my
meals
in
the
morning
and
the
evening
and
often
enough
she
d
stop
to
talk
with
me
while
i
was
eating
she
was
a
very
chatty
girl
and
i
was
a
talkative
person
myself
when
she
was
about
eighteen
years
of
age
i
got
so
used
to
her
that
if
her
mother
came
with
the
food
i
would
be
worried
for
the
rest
of
the
day
her
face
was
as
bright
as
a
sunbeam
and
her
lazy
careless
ways
big
free
movements
and
girlish
chatter
were
pleasant
to
a
man
whose
loneliness
was
only
beginning
to
be
apparent
to
him
through
her
company
i
ve
thought
of
it
often
since
and
i
suppose
that
s
how
it
began
she
used
to
listen
to
all
my
opinions
and
she
d
agree
with
them
because
she
had
none
of
her
own
yet
she
was
a
good
girl
but
lazy
in
her
mind
and
body
childish
in
fact
her
talk
was
as
involved
as
her
actions
she
always
seemed
to
be
sliding
down
mental
bannisters
she
thought
in
kinks
and
spoke
in
spasms
hopped
mentally
from
one
subject
to
another
without
the
slightest
difficulty
and
could
use
a
lot
of
language
in
saying
nothing
at
all
i
could
see
all
that
at
the
time
but
i
suppose
i
was
too
pleased
with
my
own
sharp
business
brains
and
sick
enough
although
i
did
not
know
it
of
my
business
companions
dear
lord
i
remember
them
well
it
s
easy
enough
to
have
brains
as
they
call
it
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
have
a
little
gaiety
or
carelessness
or
childishness
or
whatever
it
was
she
had
it
is
good
too
to
feel
superior
to
some
one
even
a
girl
one
day
this
thought
came
to
me
it
is
time
that
i
settled
i
don
t
know
where
the
idea
came
from
one
hears
it
often
enough
and
it
always
seems
to
apply
to
some
one
else
but
i
don
t
know
what
brought
it
to
roost
with
me
i
was
foolish
too
i
bought
ties
and
differently
shaped
collars
and
took
to
creasing
my
trousers
by
folding
them
under
the
bed
and
lying
on
them
all
night
it
never
struck
me
that
i
was
more
than
three
times
her
age
i
brought
home
sweets
for
her
and
she
was
delighted
she
said
she
adored
sweets
and
she
used
to
insist
on
my
eating
some
of
them
with
her
she
liked
to
compare
notes
as
to
how
they
tasted
while
eating
them
i
used
to
get
a
toothache
from
them
but
i
bore
with
it
although
at
that
time
i
hated
toothache
almost
as
much
as
i
hated
sweets
then
i
asked
her
to
come
out
with
me
for
a
walk
she
was
willing
enough
and
it
was
a
novel
experience
for
me
indeed
it
was
rather
exciting
we
went
out
together
often
after
that
and
sometimes
we
d
meet
people
i
knew
young
men
from
my
office
or
from
other
offices
i
used
to
be
shy
when
some
of
these
people
winked
at
me
as
they
saluted
it
was
pleasant
too
telling
the
girl
who
they
were
their
business
and
their
salaries
for
there
was
little
i
didn
t
know
i
used
to
tell
her
of
my
own
position
in
the
office
and
what
the
chief
said
to
me
through
the
day
sometimes
we
talked
of
the
things
that
had
appeared
in
the
evening
papers
a
murder
perhaps
some
phase
of
a
divorce
case
the
speech
a
political
person
had
made
or
the
price
of
stock
she
was
interested
in
anything
so
long
as
it
was
talk
and
her
own
share
in
the
conversation
was
good
to
hear
every
lady
that
passed
us
had
a
hat
that
stirred
her
to
the
top
of
rapture
or
the
other
pinnacle
of
disgust
she
told
me
what
ladies
were
frights
and
what
were
ducks
under
her
scampering
tongue
i
began
to
learn
something
of
humanity
even
though
she
saw
most
people
as
delightfully
funny
clowns
or
superb
majestical
princes
but
i
noticed
that
she
never
said
a
bad
word
of
a
man
although
many
of
the
men
she
looked
after
were
ordinary
enough
until
i
went
walking
with
her
i
never
knew
what
a
shop
window
was
a
jeweller
s
window
especially
there
were
curious
things
in
it
she
told
me
how
a
tiara
should
be
worn
and
a
pendant
and
she
explained
the
kind
of
studs
i
should
wear
myself
they
were
made
of
gold
and
had
red
stones
in
them
she
showed
me
the
ropes
of
pearl
or
diamonds
that
she
thought
would
look
pretty
on
herself
and
one
day
she
said
that
she
liked
me
very
much
i
was
pleased
and
excited
that
day
but
i
was
a
business
man
and
i
said
very
little
in
reply
i
never
liked
a
pig
in
a
poke
she
used
to
go
out
two
nights
in
the
week
monday
and
thursday
dressed
in
her
best
clothes
i
didn
t
know
where
she
went
and
i
didn
t
ask
i
thought
she
visited
an
acquaintance
a
girl
friend
or
some
such
the
time
went
by
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
her
to
marry
me
i
had
watched
her
long
enough
and
she
was
always
kind
and
bright
i
liked
the
way
she
smiled
and
i
liked
her
obedient
mannerly
bearing
there
was
something
else
i
liked
which
i
did
not
recognise
then
something
surrounding
all
her
movements
a
graciousness
a
spaciousness
i
did
not
analyse
it
but
i
know
now
that
it
was
her
youth
i
remember
that
when
we
were
out
together
she
walked
slowly
but
in
the
house
she
would
leap
up
and
down
the
stairs
she
moved
furiously
but
i
didn
t
one
evening
she
dressed
to
go
out
as
usual
and
she
called
at
my
door
to
know
had
i
everything
i
wanted
i
said
i
had
something
to
tell
her
when
she
came
home
something
important
she
promised
to
come
in
early
to
hear
it
and
i
laughed
at
her
and
she
laughed
back
and
went
sliding
down
the
bannisters
i
don
t
think
i
have
had
any
reason
to
laugh
since
that
night
a
letter
came
for
me
after
she
had
gone
and
i
knew
by
the
shape
and
the
handwriting
that
it
was
from
the
office
it
puzzled
me
to
think
why
i
should
be
written
to
i
didn
t
like
opening
it
somehow
it
was
my
dismissal
on
account
of
advancing
age
and
it
hoped
for
my
future
welfare
politely
enough
it
was
signed
by
the
senior
i
didn
t
grip
it
at
first
and
then
i
thought
it
was
a
hoax
for
a
long
time
i
sat
in
my
room
with
an
empty
mind
i
was
watching
my
mind
there
were
immense
distances
in
it
that
drowsed
and
buzzed
large
soft
movements
seemed
to
be
made
in
my
mind
and
although
i
was
looking
at
the
letter
in
my
hand
i
was
really
trying
to
focus
those
great
swinging
spaces
in
my
brain
and
my
ears
were
listening
for
a
movement
of
some
kind
i
can
see
back
to
that
time
plainly
i
went
walking
up
and
down
the
room
there
was
a
dull
subterranean
anger
in
me
i
remember
muttering
once
or
twice
shameful
and
again
i
said
ridiculous
at
the
idea
of
age
i
looked
at
my
face
in
the
glass
but
i
was
looking
at
my
mind
and
it
seemed
to
go
grey
there
was
a
heaviness
there
also
i
seemed
to
be
peering
from
beneath
a
weight
at
something
strange
i
had
a
feeling
that
i
had
let
go
a
grip
which
i
had
held
tightly
for
a
long
time
and
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
letting
go
was
a
grave
disaster
that
strange
face
in
the
glass
how
wrinkled
it
was
there
were
only
a
few
hairs
on
the
head
and
they
were
grey
ones
there
was
a
constant
twitching
of
the
lips
and
the
eyes
were
little
and
dull
i
left
the
glass
and
sat
down
by
the
window
looking
out
i
saw
nothing
in
the
street
i
just
looked
into
a
blackness
my
mind
was
as
blank
as
the
night
and
as
soundless
there
was
a
swirl
outside
the
window
rain
tossed
by
the
wind
without
noticing
i
saw
it
and
my
brain
swung
with
the
rain
until
it
heaved
in
circles
and
then
a
feeling
of
faintness
awakened
me
to
myself
i
did
not
allow
my
mind
to
think
but
now
and
again
a
word
swooped
from
immense
distances
through
my
brain
swinging
like
a
comet
across
a
sky
and
jarring
terribly
when
it
struck
sacked
was
one
word
old
was
another
word
i
don
t
know
how
long
i
sat
watching
the
flight
of
these
dreadful
words
and
listening
to
their
clanking
impact
but
a
movement
in
the
street
aroused
me
two
people
the
girl
and
a
young
slender
man
were
coming
slowly
up
to
the
house
the
rain
was
falling
heavily
but
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
there
was
a
big
puddle
of
water
close
to
the
kerb
and
the
girl
stepping
daintily
as
a
cat
went
round
this
but
the
young
man
stood
for
a
moment
beyond
it
he
raised
both
arms
clenched
his
fists
swung
them
and
jumped
over
the
puddle
then
he
and
the
girl
stood
looking
at
the
water
apparently
measuring
the
jump
i
could
see
them
plainly
by
a
street
lamp
they
were
bidding
each
other
the
girl
put
her
hand
to
his
neck
and
settled
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
while
her
hand
rested
on
him
the
young
man
suddenly
and
violently
flung
his
arms
about
her
and
hugged
her
then
they
kissed
and
moved
apart
the
man
walked
to
the
rain
puddle
and
stood
there
with
his
face
turned
back
laughing
at
her
and
then
he
jumped
straight
into
the
middle
of
the
puddle
and
began
to
dance
up
and
down
in
it
the
muddy
water
splashing
up
to
his
knees
she
ran
over
to
him
crying
stop
silly
when
she
came
into
the
house
i
bolted
my
door
and
i
gave
no
answer
to
her
knock
in
a
few
months
the
money
i
had
saved
was
spent
i
couldn
t
get
any
work
i
was
too
old
they
put
it
that
they
wanted
a
younger
man
i
couldn
t
pay
my
rent
i
went
out
into
the
world
again
like
a
baby
an
old
baby
in
a
new
world
i
stole
food
food
food
anywhere
and
everywhere
at
first
i
was
always
caught
often
i
was
sent
to
gaol
sometimes
i
was
let
go
sometimes
i
was
kicked
but
i
learned
to
live
like
a
wolf
at
last
i
am
not
often
caught
now
when
i
steal
food
but
there
is
something
happening
every
day
whether
it
is
going
to
gaol
or
planning
how
to
steal
a
hen
or
a
loaf
of
bread
i
find
that
it
is
a
good
life
much
better
than
the
one
i
lived
for
nearly
sixty
years
and
i
have
time
to
think
over
every
sort
of
thing
when
the
morning
came
the
philosopher
was
taken
on
a
car
to
the
big
city
in
order
that
he
might
be
put
on
his
trial
and
hanged
it
was
the
custom
book
vi
the
thin
woman
s
journey
and
the
happy
march
chapter
xvii
the
ability
of
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
for
anger
was
unbounded
she
was
not
one
of
those
limited
creatures
who
are
swept
clean
by
a
gust
of
wrath
and
left
placid
and
smiling
after
its
passing
she
could
store
her
anger
in
those
caverns
of
eternity
which
open
into
every
soul
and
which
are
filled
with
rage
and
violence
until
the
time
comes
when
they
may
be
stored
with
wisdom
and
love
for
in
the
genesis
of
life
love
is
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
things
first
like
a
laughing
child
love
came
to
labour
minutely
in
the
rocks
and
sands
of
the
heart
opening
the
first
of
those
roads
which
lead
inwards
for
ever
and
then
the
labour
of
his
day
being
done
love
fled
away
and
was
forgotten
following
came
the
fierce
winds
of
hate
to
work
like
giants
and
gnomes
among
the
prodigious
debris
quarrying
the
rocks
and
levelling
the
roads
which
soar
inwards
but
when
that
work
is
completed
love
will
come
radiantly
again
to
live
for
ever
in
the
human
heart
which
is
eternity
before
the
thin
woman
could
undertake
the
redemption
of
her
husband
by
wrath
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
be
purified
by
the
performance
of
that
sacrifice
which
is
called
the
forgiveness
of
enemies
and
this
she
did
by
embracing
the
leprecauns
of
the
gort
and
in
the
presence
of
the
sun
and
the
wind
remitting
their
crime
against
her
husband
thus
she
became
free
to
devote
her
malice
against
the
state
of
punishment
while
forgiving
the
individuals
who
had
but
acted
in
obedience
to
the
pressure
of
their
infernal
environment
which
pressure
is
sin
this
done
she
set
about
baking
the
three
cakes
against
her
journey
to
angus
og
while
she
was
baking
the
cakes
the
children
seumas
and
brigid
beg
slipped
away
into
the
wood
to
speak
to
each
other
and
to
wonder
over
this
extraordinary
occurrence
at
first
their
movements
were
very
careful
for
they
could
not
be
quite
sure
that
the
policemen
had
really
gone
away
or
whether
they
were
hiding
in
dark
places
waiting
to
pounce
on
them
and
carry
them
away
to
captivity
the
word
murder
was
almost
unknown
to
them
and
its
strangeness
was
rendered
still
more
strange
by
reason
of
the
nearness
of
their
father
to
the
term
it
was
a
terrible
word
and
its
terror
was
magnified
by
their
father
s
unthinkable
implication
what
had
he
done
almost
all
his
actions
and
habits
were
so
familiar
to
them
as
to
be
commonplace
and
yet
there
was
a
dark
something
to
which
he
was
a
party
and
which
dashed
before
them
as
terrible
and
ungraspable
as
a
they
understood
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
that
other
father
and
mother
whose
bodies
had
been
snatched
from
beneath
the
hearthstone
but
they
knew
the
philosopher
had
done
nothing
in
that
instance
and
so
they
saw
murder
as
a
terrible
occult
affair
which
was
quite
beyond
their
mental
horizons
no
one
jumped
out
on
them
from
behind
the
trees
so
in
a
little
time
their
confidence
returned
and
they
walked
less
carefully
when
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
pine
wood
the
brilliant
sunshine
invited
them
to
go
farther
and
after
a
little
hesitation
they
did
so
the
good
spaces
and
the
sweet
air
dissipated
their
melancholy
thoughts
and
very
soon
they
were
racing
each
other
to
this
point
and
to
that
their
wayward
flights
had
carried
them
in
the
direction
of
meehawl
macmurrachu
s
cottage
and
here
breathlessly
they
threw
themselves
under
a
small
tree
to
rest
it
was
a
thorn
bush
and
as
they
sat
beneath
it
the
cessation
of
movement
gave
them
opportunity
to
again
consider
the
terrible
position
of
their
father
with
children
thought
can
not
be
separated
from
action
for
very
long
they
think
as
much
with
their
hands
as
with
their
heads
they
have
to
do
the
thing
they
speak
of
in
order
to
visualise
the
idea
and
consequently
seumas
beg
was
soon
reconstructing
the
earlier
visit
of
the
policemen
to
their
house
in
grand
pantomime
the
ground
beneath
the
thorn
bush
became
the
hearthstone
of
their
cottage
he
and
brigid
became
four
policemen
and
in
a
moment
he
was
digging
furiously
with
a
broad
piece
of
wood
to
find
the
two
hidden
bodies
he
had
digged
for
only
a
few
minutes
when
the
piece
of
wood
struck
against
something
hard
a
very
little
time
sufficed
to
throw
the
soil
off
this
and
their
delight
was
great
when
they
unearthed
a
beautiful
little
earthen
crock
filled
to
the
brim
with
shining
yellow
dust
when
they
lifted
this
they
were
astonished
at
its
great
weight
they
played
for
a
long
time
with
it
letting
the
heavy
yellow
shower
slip
through
their
fingers
and
watching
it
glisten
in
the
sunshine
after
they
tired
of
this
they
decided
to
bring
the
crock
home
but
by
the
time
they
reached
the
gort
na
cloca
mora
they
were
so
tired
that
they
could
not
carry
it
any
farther
and
they
decided
to
leave
it
with
their
friends
the
leprecauns
seumas
beg
gave
the
taps
on
the
tree
trunk
which
they
had
learned
and
in
a
moment
the
leprecaun
whom
they
knew
came
up
we
have
brought
this
sir
said
seumas
but
he
got
no
further
for
the
instant
the
leprecaun
saw
the
crock
he
threw
his
arms
around
it
and
wept
in
so
loud
a
voice
that
his
comrades
swarmed
up
to
see
what
had
happened
to
him
and
they
added
their
laughter
and
tears
to
his
to
which
chorus
the
children
subjoined
their
sympathetic
clamour
so
that
a
noise
of
great
complexity
rang
through
all
the
gort
but
the
leprecauns
surrender
to
this
happy
passion
was
short
hard
on
their
gladness
came
remembrance
and
consternation
and
then
repentance
that
dismal
virtue
wailed
in
their
ears
and
their
hearts
how
could
they
thank
the
children
whose
father
and
protector
they
had
delivered
to
the
unilluminated
justice
of
humanity
that
justice
which
demands
not
atonement
but
punishment
which
is
learned
in
the
book
of
enmity
but
not
in
the
book
of
friendship
which
calls
hatred
nature
and
love
a
conspiracy
whose
law
is
an
iron
chain
and
whose
mercy
is
debility
and
chagrin
the
blind
fiend
who
would
impose
his
own
blindness
that
unfruitful
loin
which
curses
fertility
that
stony
heart
which
would
petrify
the
generations
of
man
before
whom
life
withers
away
appalled
and
death
would
shudder
again
to
its
tomb
repentance
they
wiped
the
inadequate
ooze
from
their
eyes
and
danced
joyfully
for
spite
they
could
do
no
more
so
they
fed
the
children
lovingly
and
carried
them
home
the
thin
woman
had
baked
three
cakes
one
of
these
she
gave
to
each
of
the
children
and
one
she
kept
herself
whereupon
they
set
out
upon
their
journey
to
angus
og
it
was
well
after
midday
when
they
started
the
fresh
gaiety
of
the
morning
was
gone
and
a
tyrannous
sun
whose
majesty
was
almost
insupportable
forded
it
over
the
world
there
was
but
little
shade
for
the
travellers
and
after
a
time
they
became
hot
and
weary
and
thirsty
that
is
the
children
did
but
the
thin
woman
by
reason
of
her
thinness
was
proof
against
every
elemental
rigour
except
hunger
from
which
no
creature
is
free
she
strode
in
the
centre
of
the
road
a
very
volcano
of
silence
thinking
twenty
different
thoughts
at
the
one
moment
so
that
the
urgency
of
her
desire
for
utterance
kept
her
terribly
quiet
but
against
this
crust
of
quietude
there
was
accumulating
a
mass
of
speech
which
must
at
the
last
explode
or
petrify
from
this
congestion
of
thought
there
arose
the
first
deep
rumblings
precursors
of
uproar
and
another
moment
would
have
heard
the
thunder
of
her
varied
malediction
but
that
brigid
beg
began
to
cry
for
indeed
the
poor
child
was
both
tired
and
parched
to
distraction
and
seumas
had
no
barrier
against
a
similar
surrender
but
two
minutes
worth
of
boyish
pride
this
discovery
withdrew
the
thin
woman
from
her
fiery
contemplations
and
in
comforting
the
children
she
forgot
her
own
hardships
it
became
necessary
to
find
water
quickly
no
difficult
thing
for
the
thin
woman
being
a
natural
was
like
all
other
creatures
able
to
sense
the
whereabouts
of
water
and
so
she
at
once
led
the
children
in
a
slightly
different
direction
in
a
few
minutes
they
reached
a
well
by
the
and
here
the
children
drank
deeply
and
were
comforted
there
was
a
wide
leafy
tree
growing
hard
by
the
well
and
in
the
shade
of
this
tree
they
sat
down
and
ate
their
cakes
while
they
rested
the
thin
woman
advised
the
children
on
many
important
matters
she
never
addressed
her
discourse
to
both
of
them
at
once
but
spoke
first
to
seumas
on
one
subject
and
then
to
brigid
on
another
subject
for
as
she
said
the
things
which
a
boy
must
learn
are
not
those
which
are
necessary
to
a
girl
it
is
particularly
important
that
a
man
should
understand
how
to
circumvent
women
for
this
and
the
capture
of
food
forms
the
basis
of
masculine
wisdom
and
on
this
subject
she
spoke
to
seumas
it
is
however
equally
urgent
that
a
woman
should
be
skilled
to
keep
a
man
in
his
proper
place
and
to
this
thesis
brigid
gave
an
undivided
attention
she
taught
that
a
man
must
hate
all
women
before
he
is
able
to
love
a
woman
but
that
he
is
at
liberty
or
rather
he
is
under
express
command
to
love
all
men
because
they
are
of
his
kind
women
also
should
love
all
other
women
as
themselves
and
they
should
hate
all
men
but
one
man
only
and
him
they
should
seek
to
turn
into
a
woman
because
women
by
the
order
of
their
beings
must
be
either
tyrants
or
slaves
and
it
is
better
they
should
be
tyrants
than
slaves
she
explained
that
between
men
and
women
there
exists
a
state
of
unremitting
warfare
and
that
the
endeavour
of
each
sex
is
to
bring
the
other
to
subjection
but
that
women
are
possessed
by
a
demon
called
pity
which
severely
handicaps
their
battle
and
perpetually
gives
victory
to
the
male
who
is
thus
constantly
rescued
on
the
very
ridges
of
defeat
she
said
to
seumas
that
his
fatal
day
would
dawn
when
he
loved
a
woman
because
he
would
sacrifice
his
destiny
to
her
caprice
and
she
begged
him
for
love
of
her
to
beware
of
all
that
twisty
sex
to
brigid
she
revealed
that
a
woman
s
terrible
day
is
upon
her
when
she
knows
that
a
man
loves
her
for
a
man
in
love
submits
only
to
a
woman
a
partial
individual
and
temporary
submission
but
a
woman
who
is
loved
surrenders
more
fully
to
the
very
god
of
love
himself
and
so
she
becomes
a
slave
and
is
not
alone
deprived
of
her
personal
liberty
but
is
even
infected
in
her
mental
processes
by
this
crafty
obsession
the
fates
work
for
man
and
therefore
she
averred
woman
must
be
victorious
for
those
who
dare
to
war
against
the
gods
are
already
assured
of
victory
this
being
the
law
of
life
that
only
the
weak
shall
conquer
the
limit
of
strength
is
petrifaction
and
immobility
but
there
is
no
limit
to
weakness
and
cunning
or
fluidity
is
its
counsellor
for
these
reasons
and
in
order
that
life
might
not
cease
women
should
seek
to
turn
their
husbands
into
women
then
they
would
be
tyrants
and
their
husbands
would
be
slaves
and
life
would
be
renewed
for
a
further
period
as
the
thin
woman
proceeded
with
this
lesson
it
became
at
last
so
extremely
complicated
that
she
was
brought
to
a
stand
by
the
knots
so
she
decided
to
resume
their
journey
and
disentangle
her
argument
when
the
weather
became
cooler
they
were
repacking
the
cakes
in
their
wallets
when
they
observed
a
stout
comely
female
coming
towards
the
well
this
woman
when
she
drew
near
saluted
the
thin
woman
and
her
the
thin
woman
saluted
again
whereupon
the
stranger
sat
down
it
s
hot
weather
surely
said
she
and
i
m
thinking
it
s
as
much
as
a
body
s
life
is
worth
to
be
travelling
this
day
and
the
sun
the
way
it
is
did
you
come
far
now
ma
am
or
is
it
that
you
are
used
to
going
the
roads
and
don
t
mind
it
not
far
said
the
thin
woman
far
or
near
said
the
stranger
a
perch
is
as
much
as
i
d
like
to
travel
this
time
of
the
year
that
s
a
fine
pair
of
children
you
have
with
you
now
ma
they
are
said
the
thin
woman
i
ve
ten
of
them
myself
the
other
continued
and
i
often
wondered
where
they
came
from
it
s
queer
to
think
of
one
woman
making
ten
new
creatures
and
she
not
getting
a
penny
for
it
nor
any
thanks
it
is
said
the
thin
woman
do
you
ever
talk
more
than
two
words
at
the
one
time
ma
am
said
the
stranger
i
do
said
the
thin
woman
i
d
give
a
penny
to
hear
you
replied
the
other
angrily
for
a
more
cantankerous
person
than
yourself
i
never
met
among
womankind
it
s
what
i
said
to
a
man
only
yesterday
that
thin
ones
are
bad
ones
and
there
isn
t
any
one
could
be
thinner
than
you
are
the
reason
you
say
that
said
the
thin
woman
calmly
is
because
you
are
fat
and
you
have
to
tell
lies
to
yourself
to
hide
your
misfortune
and
let
on
that
you
like
it
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
could
like
to
be
fat
and
there
i
leave
you
ma
am
you
can
poke
your
finger
in
your
own
eye
but
you
may
keep
it
out
of
mine
if
you
please
and
so
to
you
and
if
i
wasn
t
a
quiet
woman
i
d
pull
you
by
the
hair
of
the
head
up
a
hill
and
down
a
hill
for
two
hours
and
now
there
s
an
end
of
it
i
ve
given
you
more
than
two
words
let
you
take
care
or
i
ll
give
you
two
more
that
will
put
blisters
on
your
body
for
ever
come
along
with
me
now
children
and
if
ever
you
see
a
woman
like
that
woman
you
ll
know
that
she
eats
until
she
can
t
stand
and
drinks
until
she
can
t
sit
and
sleeps
until
she
is
stupid
and
if
that
sort
of
person
ever
talks
to
you
remember
that
two
words
are
all
that
s
due
to
her
and
let
them
be
short
ones
for
a
woman
like
that
would
be
a
traitor
and
a
thief
only
that
she
s
too
lazy
to
be
anything
but
a
sot
god
help
her
i
and
so
thereupon
the
thin
woman
and
the
children
arose
and
having
saluted
the
stranger
they
went
down
the
wide
path
but
the
other
woman
stayed
where
she
was
sitting
and
she
did
not
say
a
word
even
to
herself
as
she
strode
along
the
thin
woman
lapsed
again
to
her
anger
and
became
so
distant
in
her
aspect
that
the
children
could
get
no
companionship
from
her
so
after
a
while
they
ceased
to
consider
her
at
all
and
addressed
themselves
to
their
play
they
danced
before
and
behind
and
around
her
they
ran
and
doubled
shouted
and
laughed
and
sang
sometimes
they
pretended
they
were
husband
and
wife
and
then
they
plodded
quietly
side
by
side
making
wise
occasional
remarks
on
the
weather
or
the
condition
of
their
health
or
the
state
of
the
fields
of
rye
sometimes
one
was
a
horse
and
the
other
was
a
driver
and
then
they
stamped
along
the
road
with
loud
fierce
snortings
and
louder
and
fiercer
commands
at
another
moment
one
was
a
cow
being
driven
with
great
difficulty
to
market
by
a
driver
whose
temper
had
given
way
hours
before
or
they
both
became
goats
and
with
their
heads
jammed
together
they
pushed
and
squealed
viciously
and
these
changes
lapsed
into
one
another
so
easily
that
at
no
moment
were
they
unoccupied
but
as
the
day
wore
on
to
evening
the
immense
surrounding
quietude
began
to
weigh
heavily
upon
them
saving
for
their
own
shrill
voices
there
was
no
sound
and
this
unending
wide
silence
at
last
commanded
them
to
a
corresponding
quietness
little
by
little
they
ceased
their
play
the
scamper
became
a
trot
each
run
was
more
and
more
curtailed
in
its
length
the
race
back
became
swifter
than
the
run
forth
and
shortly
they
were
pacing
soberly
enough
one
on
either
side
of
the
thin
woman
sending
back
and
forth
a
few
quiet
sentences
soon
even
these
sentences
trailed
away
into
the
vast
surrounding
stillness
then
brigid
beg
clutched
the
thin
woman
s
right
hand
and
not
long
after
seumas
gently
clasped
her
left
hand
and
these
mute
appeals
for
protection
and
comfort
again
released
her
from
the
valleys
of
fury
through
which
she
had
been
so
fiercely
careering
as
they
went
gently
along
they
saw
a
cow
lying
in
a
field
and
seeing
this
animal
the
thin
woman
stopped
thoughtfully
everything
said
she
belongs
to
the
wayfarer
and
she
crossed
into
the
field
and
milked
the
cow
into
a
vessel
which
she
had
i
wonder
said
seumas
who
owns
that
maybe
said
brigid
beg
nobody
owns
her
at
the
cow
owns
herself
said
the
thin
woman
for
nobody
can
own
a
thing
that
is
alive
i
am
sure
she
gives
her
milk
to
us
with
great
goodwill
for
we
are
modest
temperate
people
without
greed
or
on
being
released
the
cow
lay
down
again
in
the
grass
and
resumed
its
interrupted
cud
as
the
evening
had
grown
chill
the
thin
woman
and
the
children
huddled
close
to
the
warm
animal
they
drew
pieces
of
cake
from
their
wallets
and
ate
these
and
drank
happily
from
the
vessel
of
milk
now
and
then
the
cow
looked
benignantly
over
its
shoulder
bidding
them
a
welcome
to
its
hospitable
flanks
it
had
a
mild
motherly
eye
and
it
was
very
fond
of
children
the
youngsters
continually
deserted
their
meal
in
order
to
put
their
arms
about
the
cow
s
neck
to
thank
and
praise
her
for
her
goodness
and
to
draw
each
other
s
attention
to
various
excellences
in
its
appearance
cow
said
brigid
beg
in
an
ecstasy
i
love
so
do
i
said
seumas
do
you
notice
the
kind
of
eyes
it
has
why
does
a
cow
have
horns
said
brigid
so
they
asked
the
cow
that
question
but
it
only
smiled
and
said
nothing
if
a
cow
talked
to
you
said
brigid
what
would
it
say
let
us
be
cows
replied
seumas
and
then
maybe
we
will
find
so
they
became
cows
and
ate
a
few
blades
of
grass
but
they
found
that
when
they
were
cows
they
did
not
want
to
say
anything
but
moo
and
they
decided
that
cows
did
not
want
to
say
anything
more
than
that
either
and
they
became
interested
in
the
reflection
that
perhaps
nothing
else
was
worth
saying
a
long
thin
fly
was
going
in
that
direction
on
a
journey
and
he
stopped
to
rest
himself
on
the
cow
s
nose
you
are
welcome
said
the
cow
it
s
a
great
night
for
travelling
said
the
fly
but
one
gets
tired
alone
have
you
seen
any
of
my
people
about
no
replied
the
cow
no
one
but
beetles
and
they
seldom
stop
for
a
talk
you
ve
rather
a
good
kind
of
life
i
suppose
flying
about
and
enjoying
we
all
have
our
troubles
said
the
fly
in
a
melancholy
voice
and
he
commenced
to
clean
his
right
wing
with
his
leg
does
any
one
ever
lie
against
your
back
the
way
these
people
are
lying
against
mine
or
do
they
steal
your
milk
there
are
too
many
spiders
about
said
the
fly
no
corner
is
safe
from
them
they
squat
in
the
grass
and
pounce
on
you
i
ve
got
a
twist
my
eye
trying
to
watch
them
they
are
ugly
voracious
people
without
manners
or
neighbourliness
terrible
terrible
i
have
seen
them
said
the
cow
but
they
never
done
me
any
harm
move
up
a
little
bit
please
i
want
to
lick
my
nose
it
s
queer
how
itchy
my
nose
gets
the
fly
moved
up
a
bit
if
the
cow
continued
you
had
stayed
there
and
if
my
tongue
had
hit
you
i
don
t
suppose
you
would
ever
have
your
tongue
couldn
t
have
hit
me
said
the
by
i
move
very
quickly
you
hereupon
the
cow
slily
whacked
her
tongue
across
her
nose
she
did
not
see
the
fly
move
but
it
was
hovering
safely
half
an
inch
over
her
nose
you
see
said
the
fly
i
do
replied
the
cow
and
she
bellowed
so
sudden
and
furious
a
snort
of
laughter
that
the
fly
was
blown
far
away
by
that
gust
and
never
came
back
again
this
amused
the
cow
exceedingly
and
she
chuckled
and
sniggered
to
herself
for
a
long
time
the
children
had
listened
with
great
interest
to
the
conversation
and
they
also
laughed
delightedly
and
the
thin
woman
admitted
that
the
fly
had
got
the
worse
of
it
but
after
a
while
she
said
that
the
part
of
the
cow
s
back
against
which
she
was
resting
was
bonier
than
anything
she
had
ever
leaned
upon
before
and
that
while
thinness
was
a
virtue
no
one
had
any
right
to
be
thin
in
lumps
and
that
on
this
count
the
cow
was
not
to
be
commended
on
hearing
this
the
cow
arose
and
without
another
look
at
them
it
walked
away
into
the
dusky
field
the
thin
woman
told
the
children
afterwards
that
she
was
sorry
she
had
said
anything
but
she
was
unable
to
bring
her
self
to
apologise
to
the
cow
and
so
they
were
forced
to
resume
their
journey
in
order
to
keep
themselves
warm
there
was
a
sickle
moon
in
the
sky
a
tender
sword
whose
radiance
stayed
in
its
own
high
places
and
did
not
at
all
illumine
the
heavy
world
below
the
glimmer
of
infrequent
stars
could
also
be
seen
with
spacious
dark
solitudes
between
them
but
on
the
earth
the
darkness
gathered
in
fold
on
fold
of
misty
veiling
through
which
the
trees
uttered
an
earnest
whisper
and
the
grasses
lifted
their
little
voices
and
the
wind
crooned
its
thrilling
stern
lament
as
the
travellers
walked
on
their
eyes
flinching
from
the
darkness
rested
joyfully
on
the
gracious
moon
but
that
joy
lasted
only
for
a
little
time
the
thin
woman
spoke
to
them
curiously
about
the
moon
and
indeed
she
might
speak
with
assurance
on
that
subject
for
her
ancestors
had
sported
in
the
cold
beam
through
countless
dim
generations
it
is
not
known
said
she
that
the
fairies
seldom
dance
for
joy
but
for
sadness
that
they
have
been
expelled
from
the
sweet
dawn
and
therefore
their
midnight
revels
are
only
ceremonies
to
remind
them
of
their
happy
state
in
the
morning
of
the
world
before
thoughtful
curiosity
and
moralities
drove
them
from
the
kind
face
of
the
sun
to
the
dark
exile
of
midnight
it
is
strange
that
we
may
not
be
angry
while
looking
on
the
moon
indeed
no
mere
appetite
or
passion
of
any
kind
dare
become
imperative
in
the
presence
of
the
shining
one
and
this
in
a
more
limited
degree
is
true
also
of
every
form
of
beauty
for
there
is
something
in
an
absolute
beauty
to
chide
away
the
desires
of
materiality
and
yet
to
dissolve
the
spirit
in
ecstasies
of
fear
and
sadness
beauty
has
no
liking
for
thought
but
will
send
terror
and
sorrow
on
those
who
look
upon
her
with
intelligent
eyes
we
may
neither
be
angry
nor
gay
in
the
presence
of
the
moon
nor
may
we
dare
to
think
in
her
bailiwick
or
the
jealous
one
will
surely
afflict
us
i
think
that
she
is
not
benevolent
but
malign
and
that
her
mildness
is
a
cloak
for
many
shy
infamies
i
think
that
beauty
tends
to
become
frightful
as
it
becomes
perfect
and
that
if
we
could
see
it
comprehendingly
the
extreme
of
beauty
is
a
desolating
hideousness
and
that
the
name
of
ultimate
absolute
beauty
is
madness
therefore
men
should
seek
loveliness
rather
than
beauty
and
so
they
would
always
have
a
friend
to
go
beside
them
to
understand
and
to
comfort
them
for
that
is
the
business
of
loveliness
but
the
business
of
beauty
there
is
no
person
at
all
knows
what
that
is
beauty
is
the
extreme
which
has
not
yet
swung
to
and
become
merged
in
its
opposite
the
poets
have
sung
of
this
beauty
and
the
philosophers
have
prophesied
of
it
thinking
that
the
beauty
which
passes
all
understanding
is
also
the
peace
which
passeth
understanding
but
i
think
that
whatever
passes
understanding
which
is
imagination
is
terrible
standing
aloof
from
humanity
and
from
kindness
and
that
this
is
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
the
great
artist
an
isolated
perfection
is
a
symbol
of
terror
and
pride
and
it
is
followed
only
by
the
head
of
man
but
the
heart
winces
from
it
aghast
cleaving
to
that
loveliness
which
is
modesty
and
righteousness
every
extreme
is
bad
in
order
that
it
may
swing
to
and
fertilize
its
equally
horrible
thus
speaking
more
to
herself
than
to
the
children
the
thin
woman
beguiled
the
way
the
moon
had
brightened
as
she
spoke
and
on
either
side
of
the
path
wherever
there
was
a
tree
or
a
rise
in
the
ground
a
black
shadow
was
crouching
tensely
watchful
seeming
as
if
it
might
spring
into
terrible
life
at
a
bound
of
these
shadows
the
children
became
so
fearful
that
the
thin
woman
forsook
the
path
and
adventured
on
the
open
hillside
so
that
in
a
short
time
the
road
was
left
behind
and
around
them
stretched
the
quiet
slopes
in
the
full
shining
of
the
moon
when
they
had
walked
for
a
long
time
the
children
became
sleepy
they
were
unused
to
being
awake
in
the
night
and
as
there
was
no
place
where
they
could
rest
and
as
it
was
evident
that
they
could
not
walk
much
further
the
thin
woman
grew
anxious
already
brigid
had
made
a
tiny
whimpering
sound
and
seumas
had
followed
this
with
a
sigh
the
slightest
prolongation
of
which
might
have
trailed
into
a
sob
and
when
children
are
overtaken
by
tears
they
do
not
understand
how
to
escape
from
them
until
they
are
simply
bored
by
much
weeping
when
they
topped
a
slight
incline
they
saw
a
light
shining
some
distance
away
and
toward
this
the
thin
woman
hurried
as
they
drew
near
she
saw
it
was
a
small
fire
and
around
this
some
figures
were
seated
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
into
the
circle
of
the
firelight
and
here
she
halted
suddenly
she
would
have
turned
and
fled
but
fear
loosened
her
knees
so
that
they
would
not
obey
her
will
also
the
people
by
the
fire
had
observed
her
and
a
great
voice
commanded
that
she
should
draw
near
the
fire
was
made
of
branches
of
heather
and
beside
it
three
figures
sat
the
thin
woman
hiding
her
perturbation
as
well
as
she
could
came
nigh
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
after
a
low
word
of
greeting
she
gave
some
of
her
cake
to
the
children
drew
them
close
to
her
wrapped
her
shawl
about
their
heads
and
bade
them
sleep
then
shrinkingly
she
looked
at
her
hosts
they
were
quite
naked
and
each
of
them
gazed
on
her
with
intent
earnestness
the
first
was
so
beautiful
that
the
eye
failed
upon
him
flinching
aside
as
from
a
great
brightness
he
was
of
mighty
stature
and
yet
so
nobly
proportioned
so
exquisitely
slender
and
graceful
that
no
idea
of
gravity
or
bulk
went
with
his
height
his
face
was
kingly
and
youthful
and
of
a
terrifying
serenity
the
second
man
was
of
equal
height
but
broad
to
wonderment
so
broad
was
he
that
his
great
height
seemed
diminished
the
tense
arm
on
which
he
leaned
was
knotted
and
ridged
with
muscle
and
his
hand
gripped
deeply
into
the
ground
his
face
seemed
as
though
it
had
been
hammered
from
hard
rock
a
massive
blunt
face
as
rigid
as
his
arm
the
third
man
can
scarcely
be
described
he
was
neither
short
nor
tall
he
was
muscled
as
heavily
as
the
second
man
as
he
sat
he
looked
like
a
colossal
toad
squatting
with
his
arms
about
his
knees
and
upon
these
his
chin
rested
he
had
no
shape
nor
swiftness
and
his
head
was
flattened
down
and
was
scarcely
wider
than
his
neck
he
had
a
protruding
mouth
that
twitched
occasionally
and
from
his
little
eyes
there
glinted
a
horrible
intelligence
before
this
man
the
soul
of
the
thin
woman
grovelled
she
felt
herself
crawling
to
him
the
last
terrible
abasement
of
which
humanity
is
capable
came
upon
her
a
fascination
which
would
have
drawn
her
to
him
in
screaming
adoration
hardly
could
she
look
away
from
him
but
her
arms
were
about
the
children
and
love
mightiest
of
the
powers
stirred
fiercely
in
her
heart
the
first
man
spoke
to
her
woman
said
he
for
what
purpose
do
you
go
abroad
on
this
night
and
on
this
hill
i
travel
sir
said
the
thin
woman
searching
for
the
brugh
of
angus
the
son
of
the
dagda
we
are
all
children
of
the
great
father
said
he
do
you
know
who
we
are
i
do
not
know
that
said
she
we
are
the
three
absolutes
the
three
redeemers
the
three
alembics
the
most
beautiful
man
the
strongest
man
and
the
ugliest
man
in
the
midst
of
every
strife
we
go
unhurt
we
count
the
slain
and
the
victors
and
pass
on
laughing
and
to
us
in
the
eternal
order
come
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
to
be
regenerated
for
ever
why
have
you
called
to
us
i
did
not
call
to
you
indeed
said
the
thin
woman
but
why
do
you
sit
in
the
path
so
that
travellers
to
the
house
of
the
dagda
are
halted
on
their
journey
there
are
no
paths
closed
to
us
he
replied
even
the
gods
seek
us
for
they
grow
weary
in
their
splendid
desolation
saving
him
who
liveth
in
all
things
and
in
us
him
we
serve
and
before
his
awful
front
we
abase
ourselves
you
o
woman
who
are
walking
in
the
valleys
of
anger
have
called
to
us
in
your
heart
therefore
we
are
waiting
for
you
on
the
side
of
the
hill
choose
now
one
of
us
to
be
your
mate
and
do
not
fear
to
choose
for
our
kingdoms
are
equal
and
our
powers
are
why
would
i
choose
one
of
you
replied
the
thin
woman
when
i
am
well
married
already
to
the
best
man
in
the
world
beyond
us
there
is
no
best
man
said
he
for
we
are
the
best
in
beauty
and
the
best
in
strength
and
the
best
in
ugliness
there
is
no
excellence
which
is
not
contained
in
us
three
if
you
are
married
what
does
that
matter
to
us
who
are
free
from
the
pettiness
of
jealousy
and
fear
being
at
one
with
ourselves
and
with
every
manifestation
of
if
she
replied
you
are
the
absolute
and
are
above
all
pettiness
can
you
not
be
superior
to
me
also
and
let
me
pass
quietly
on
my
road
to
the
dagda
we
are
what
all
humanity
desire
quoth
he
and
we
desire
all
humanity
there
is
nothing
small
or
great
disdained
by
our
immortal
appetites
it
is
not
lawful
even
for
the
absolute
to
outgrow
desire
which
is
the
breath
of
god
quick
in
his
creatures
and
not
to
be
bounded
or
surmounted
by
any
during
this
conversation
the
other
great
figures
had
leaned
forward
listening
intently
but
saying
nothing
the
thin
woman
could
feel
the
children
like
little
terrified
birds
pressing
closely
and
very
quietly
to
her
sides
sir
said
she
tell
me
what
is
beauty
and
what
is
strength
and
what
is
ugliness
for
although
i
can
see
these
things
i
do
not
know
what
they
i
will
tell
you
that
he
replied
beauty
is
thought
and
strength
is
love
and
ugliness
is
generation
the
home
of
beauty
is
the
head
of
man
the
home
of
strength
is
the
heart
of
man
and
in
the
loins
ugliness
keeps
his
dreadful
state
if
you
come
with
me
you
shall
know
all
delight
you
shall
live
unharmed
in
the
flame
of
the
spirit
and
nothing
that
is
gross
shall
bind
your
limbs
or
hinder
your
thought
you
shall
move
as
a
queen
amongst
all
raging
passions
without
torment
or
despair
never
shall
you
be
driven
or
ashamed
but
always
you
will
choose
your
own
paths
and
walk
with
me
in
freedom
and
contentment
and
all
things
said
the
thin
woman
must
act
according
to
the
order
of
their
being
and
so
i
say
to
thought
if
you
hold
me
against
my
will
presently
i
will
bind
you
against
your
will
for
the
holder
of
an
unwilling
mate
becomes
the
guardian
and
the
slave
of
his
that
is
true
said
he
and
against
a
thing
that
is
true
i
can
not
contend
therefore
you
are
free
from
me
but
from
my
brethren
you
are
not
the
thin
woman
turned
to
the
second
man
you
are
strength
said
she
i
am
strength
and
love
he
boomed
and
with
me
there
is
safety
and
peace
my
days
have
honour
and
my
nights
quietness
there
is
no
evil
thing
walks
near
my
lands
nor
is
any
sound
heard
but
the
lowing
of
my
cattle
the
songs
of
my
birds
and
the
laughter
of
my
happy
children
come
then
to
me
who
gives
protection
and
happiness
and
peace
and
does
not
fail
or
grow
weary
at
any
i
will
not
go
with
you
said
the
thin
woman
for
i
am
a
mother
and
my
strength
can
not
be
increased
i
am
a
mother
and
my
love
can
not
be
added
to
what
have
i
further
to
desire
from
thee
thou
great
man
you
are
free
of
me
said
the
second
man
but
from
my
brother
you
are
not
then
to
the
third
man
the
thin
woman
addressed
herself
in
terror
for
to
that
hideous
one
something
cringed
within
her
in
an
ecstasy
of
loathing
that
repulsion
which
at
its
strongest
becomes
attraction
gripped
her
a
shiver
a
plunge
and
she
had
gone
but
the
hands
of
the
children
withheld
her
while
in
woe
she
abased
herself
before
him
he
spoke
and
his
voice
came
clogged
and
painful
as
though
it
urged
from
the
matted
pores
of
the
earth
itself
there
is
none
left
to
whom
you
may
go
but
me
only
do
not
be
afraid
but
come
to
me
and
i
will
give
you
these
wild
delights
which
have
been
long
forgotten
all
things
which
are
crude
and
riotous
all
that
is
gross
and
without
limit
is
mine
you
shall
not
think
and
suffer
any
longer
but
you
shall
feel
so
surely
that
the
heat
of
the
sun
will
be
happiness
the
taste
of
food
the
wind
that
blows
upon
you
the
ripe
ease
of
your
body
these
things
will
amaze
you
who
have
forgotten
them
my
great
arms
about
you
will
make
you
furious
and
young
again
you
shall
leap
on
the
hillside
like
a
young
goat
and
sing
for
joy
as
the
birds
sing
leave
this
crabbed
humanity
that
is
barred
and
chained
away
from
joy
and
come
with
me
to
whose
ancient
quietude
at
the
last
both
strength
and
beauty
will
come
like
children
tired
in
the
evening
returning
to
the
freedom
of
the
brutes
and
the
birds
with
bodies
sufficient
for
their
pleasure
and
with
no
care
for
thought
or
foolish
but
the
thin
woman
drew
back
from
his
hand
saying
it
is
not
lawful
to
turn
again
when
the
journey
is
commenced
but
to
go
forward
to
whatever
is
appointed
nor
may
we
return
to
your
meadows
and
trees
and
sunny
places
who
have
once
departed
from
them
the
torments
of
the
mind
may
not
be
renounced
for
any
easement
of
the
body
until
the
smoke
that
blinds
us
is
blown
away
and
the
tormenting
flame
has
fitted
us
for
that
immortal
ecstasy
which
is
the
bosom
of
god
nor
is
it
lawful
that
ye
great
ones
should
beset
the
path
of
travellers
seeking
to
lure
them
away
with
cunning
promises
it
is
only
at
the
ye
may
sit
where
the
traveller
will
hesitate
and
be
in
doubt
but
on
the
highway
ye
have
no
you
are
free
of
me
said
the
third
man
until
you
are
ready
to
come
to
me
again
for
i
only
of
all
things
am
steadfast
and
patient
and
to
me
all
return
in
their
seasons
there
are
brightnesses
in
my
secret
places
in
the
woods
and
lamps
in
my
gardens
beneath
the
hills
tended
by
the
angels
of
god
and
behind
my
face
there
is
another
face
not
hated
by
the
bright
so
the
three
absolutes
arose
and
strode
mightily
away
and
as
they
went
their
thunderous
speech
to
each
other
boomed
against
the
clouds
and
the
earth
like
a
gusty
wind
and
even
when
they
had
disappeared
that
great
rumble
could
be
heard
dying
gently
away
in
the
moonlit
distances
the
thin
woman
and
the
children
went
slowly
forward
on
the
rugged
sloping
way
far
beyond
near
the
distant
summit
of
the
hill
there
was
a
light
gleaming
yonder
said
the
thin
woman
is
the
brugh
of
angus
mac
an
og
the
son
of
the
dagda
mor
and
toward
this
light
she
assisted
the
weary
children
in
a
little
she
was
in
the
presence
of
the
god
and
by
him
refreshed
and
comforted
she
told
him
all
that
had
happened
to
her
husband
and
implored
his
assistance
this
was
readily
accorded
for
the
chief
business
of
the
gods
is
to
give
protection
and
assistance
to
such
of
their
people
as
require
it
but
and
this
is
their
limitation
they
can
not
give
any
help
until
it
is
demanded
the
freewill
of
mankind
being
the
most
jealously
guarded
and
holy
principle
in
life
therefore
the
interference
of
the
loving
gods
comes
only
on
an
equally
loving
summons
chapter

ni

sat
alone
in
the
brugh
of
angus
much
as
she
had
sat
on
the
hillside
and
in
the
cave
of
pan
and
again
she
was
thinking
she
was
happy
now
there
was
nothing
more
she
could
desire
for
all
that
the
earth
contained
or
the
mind
could
describe
was
hers
her
thoughts
were
no
longer
those
shy
subterranean
gropings
which
elude
the
hand
and
the
understanding
each
thought
was
a
thing
or
a
person
visible
in
its
own
radiant
personal
life
and
to
be
seen
or
felt
welcomed
or
repulsed
as
was
its
due
but
she
had
discovered
that
happiness
is
not
laughter
or
satisfaction
and
that
no
person
can
be
happy
for
themselves
alone
so
she
had
come
to
understand
the
terrible
sadness
of
the
gods
and
why
angus
wept
in
secret
for
often
in
the
night
she
had
heard
him
weeping
and
she
knew
that
his
tears
were
for
those
others
who
were
unhappy
and
that
he
could
not
be
comforted
while
there
was
a
woeful
person
or
an
evil
deed
hiding
in
the
world
her
own
happiness
also
had
become
infected
with
this
alien
misery
until
she
knew
that
nothing
was
alien
to
her
and
that
in
truth
all
persons
and
all
things
were
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
that
they
were
living
and
dying
in
distress
and
at
the
last
she
knew
that
there
was
not
any
man
but
mankind
nor
any
human
being
but
only
humanity
never
again
could
the
gratification
of
a
desire
give
her
pleasure
for
her
sense
of
oneness
was
destroyed
she
was
not
an
individual
only
she
was
also
part
of
a
mighty
organism
ordained
through
whatever
stress
to
achieve
its
oneness
and
this
great
being
was
threefold
comprising
in
its
mighty
units
god
and
man
and
nature
the
immortal
trinity
the
duty
of
life
is
the
sacrifice
of
self
it
is
to
renounce
the
little
ego
that
the
mighty
ego
may
be
freed
and
knowing
this
she
found
at
last
that
she
knew
happiness
that
divine
discontent
which
can
not
rest
nor
be
at
ease
until
its
bourne
is
attained
and
the
knowledge
of
a
man
is
added
to
the
gaiety
of
a
child
angus
had
told
her
that
beyond
this
there
lay
the
great
ecstasy
which
is
love
and
god
and
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
all
things
for
everything
must
come
from
the
liberty
into
the
bondage
that
it
may
return
again
to
the
liberty
comprehending
all
things
and
fitted
for
that
fiery
enjoyment
this
can
not
be
until
there
are
no
more
fools
living
for
until
the
last
fool
has
grown
wise
wisdom
will
totter
and
freedom
will
still
be
invisible
growth
is
not
by
years
but
by
multitudes
and
until
there
is
a
common
eye
no
one
person
can
see
god
for
the
eye
of
all
nature
will
scarcely
be
great
enough
to
look
upon
that
majesty
we
shall
greet
happiness
by
multitudes
but
we
can
only
greet
him
by
starry
systems
and
a
universal
love
she
was
so
thinking
when
angus
og
came
to
her
from
the
fields
the
god
was
very
radiant
smiling
like
the
young
morn
when
the
buds
awake
and
to
his
lips
song
came
instead
of
speech
my
beloved
said
he
we
will
go
on
a
journey
my
delight
is
where
you
go
said
caitilin
we
will
go
down
to
the
world
of
men
from
our
quiet
dwelling
among
the
hills
to
the
noisy
city
and
the
multitude
of
people
this
will
be
our
first
journey
but
on
a
time
not
distant
we
will
go
to
them
again
and
we
will
not
return
from
that
journey
for
we
will
live
among
our
people
and
be
at
may
the
day
come
soon
said
she
when
thy
son
is
a
man
he
will
go
before
us
on
that
journey
said
angus
and
caitilin
shivered
with
a
great
delight
knowing
that
a
son
would
be
born
to
her
then
angus
og
put
upon
his
bride
glorious
raiment
and
they
went
out
to
the
sunlight
it
was
the
early
morning
the
sun
had
just
risen
and
the
dew
was
sparkling
on
the
heather
and
the
grass
there
was
a
keen
stir
in
the
air
that
stung
the
blood
to
joy
so
that
caitilin
danced
in
uncontrollable
gaiety
and
angus
with
a
merry
voice
chanted
to
the
sky
and
danced
also
about
his
shining
head
the
birds
were
flying
for
every
kiss
he
gave
to
caitilin
became
a
bird
the
messengers
of
love
and
wisdom
and
they
also
burst
into
triumphant
melody
so
that
the
quiet
place
rang
with
their
glee
constantly
from
the
circling
birds
one
would
go
flying
with
great
speed
to
all
quarters
of
space
these
were
his
messengers
flying
to
every
fort
and
dun
every
rath
and
glen
and
valley
of
eire
to
raise
the
sluaige
shee
the
fairy
host
they
were
birds
of
love
that
flew
for
this
was
a
hosting
of
happiness
and
therefore
the
shee
would
not
bring
weapons
with
them
it
was
towards
kilmasheogue
their
happy
steps
were
directed
and
soon
they
came
to
the
mountain
after
the
thin
woman
of
inis
magrath
had
left
the
god
she
visited
all
the
fairy
forts
of
kilmasheogue
and
directed
the
shee
who
lived
there
to
be
in
waiting
at
the
dawn
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
consequently
when
angus
and
caitilin
came
up
the
hill
they
found
the
six
clans
coming
to
receive
them
and
with
these
were
the
people
of
the
younger
shee
members
of
the
tuatha
da
danaan
tall
and
beautiful
men
and
women
who
had
descended
to
the
quiet
underworld
when
the
pressure
of
the
sons
of
milith
forced
them
with
their
kind
enchantments
and
invincible
velour
to
the
country
of
the
gods
of
those
who
came
were
aine
ni
rogail
of
cnoc
aine
and
ivil
of
craglea
the
queens
of
north
and
south
munster
and
una
the
queen
of
ormond
these
with
their
hosts
sang
upon
the
summit
of
the
hill
welcoming
the
god
there
came
the
five
guardians
of
ulster
the
fomentors
of

whose

these
five
matchless

marched
up
the
hill
with
their
tribes
shouting
as
they
went
from
north
and
south
they
came
and
from
east
and
west
bright
and
happy
beings
a
multitude
without
fear
without
distraction
so
that
soon
the
hill
was
gay
with
their
voices
and
their
noble
raiment
among
them
came
the
people
of
the
lupra
the
ancient
leprecauns
of
the
world
leaping
like
goats
among
the
knees
of
the
heroes
they
were
headed
by
their
king

this

was
that

udan
the
chief
of
the
lupra
who
had
been
placed
under
bonds
to
taste
the
porridge
in
the
great
cauldron
of
emania
into
which
pot
he
fell
and
was
taken
captive
with
his
wife
and
held
for
five
weary
years
until
he
surrendered
that
which
he
most
valued
in
the
world
even
his
boots
the
people
of
the
hills
laugh
still
at
the
story
and
the
leprecauns
may
still
be
mortified
by
it
there
came

with

came

to

the

shouted
with
mighty
love
even
the
serene
one

the
mother
of
the

steadfast
for

her
breath
is
on
the
morning
her
smile
is
summer
from
her
hand
the
birds
of
the
air
take
their
food
the
mild
ox
is
her
friend
and
the
wolf
trots
by
her
friendly
side
at
her
voice
the
daisy
peeps
from
her
cave
and
the
nettle
couches
his
lance
the
rose
arrays
herself
in
innocence
scattering
abroad
her
sweetness
with
the
dew
and
the
oak
tree
laughs
to
her
in
the
air
thou
beautiful
the
lambs
follow
thy
footsteps

thy
bounty
in

and
are
not

through

all

come
to
us
even
the
divine
promise
and
the
breath
of
the
almighty
from
afar
laden
with
goodness
with
wonder
with
delight
the
daughter
of
murrachu
watched
the
hosting
of
the
shee
sometimes
her
eyes
were
dazzled
as
a
jewelled
forehead
blazed
in
the
sun
or
a
of
broad
gold
flamed
like
a
torch
on
fair
hair
and
dark
the
sun
gleamed
white
arms
tossed
and
glanced
a
moment
and
sank
and
reappeared
the
eyes
of
those
who
did
not
hesitate
nor
compute
looked
into
her
eyes
not
appraising
not
questioning
but
mild
and
unafraid
the
voices
of
free
people
spoke
in
her
ears
and
the
laughter
of
happy
hearts
unthoughtful
of
sin
or
shame
released
from
the
hard
bondage
of
selfhood
for
these
people
though
many
were
one
each
spoke
to
the
other
as
to
himself
without
reservation
or
subterfuge
they
moved
freely
each
in
his
personal
whim
and
they
moved
also
with
the
unity
of
one
being
for
when
they
shouted
to
the
mother
of
the
gods
they
shouted
with
one
voice
and
they
bowed
to
her
as
one
man
bows
through
the
many
minds
there
went
also
one
mind
correcting
commanding
so
that
in
a
moment
the
interchangeable
and
fluid
became
locked
and
organic
with
a
simultaneous
understanding
a
collective
was
freedom
while
she
looked
the
dancing
ceased
and
they
turned
their
faces
with
one
accord
down
the
mountain
those
in
the
front
leaped
forward
and
behind
them
the
others
went
leaping
in
orderly
progression
then
angus
og
ran
to
where
she
stood
his
bride
of
beauty
come
my
beloved
said
he
and
hand
in
hand
they
raced
among
the
others
laughing
as
they
ran
here
there
was
no
green
thing
growing
a
carpet
of
brown
turf
spread
to
the
edge
of
sight
on
the
sloping
plain
and
away
to
where
another
mountain
soared
in
the
air
they
came
to
this
and
descended
in
the
distance
groves
of
trees
could
be
seen
and
very
far
away
the
roofs
and
towers
and
spires
of
the
town
of
the
ford
of
hurdles
and
the
little
roads
that
wandered
everywhere
but
on
this
height
there
was
only
prickly
furze
growing
softly
in
the
sunlight
the
bee
droned
his
loud
song
the
birds
flew
and
sang
occasionally
and
the
little
streams
grew
heavy
with
their
falling
waters
a
little
further
and
the
bushes
were
green
and
beautiful
waving
their
gentle
leaves
in
the
quietude
and
beyond
again
wrapped
in
sunshine
and
peace
the
trees
looked
on
the
world
from
their
calm
heights
having
no
complaint
to
make
of
anything
in
a
little
they
reached
the
grass
land
and
the
dance
began
hand
sought
for
hand
feet
moved
companionably
as
though
they
loved
each
other
quietly
intimate
they
tripped
without
faltering
and
then
the
loud
song
arose
they
sang
to
the
lovers
of
gaiety
and
peace
long
defrauded
come
to
us
ye
who
do
not
know
where
ye
are
ye
who
live
among
strangers
in
the
house
of
dismay
and
poor
awkward
ones
how
bewildered
and
bedevilled
ye
go
amazed
ye
look
and
do
not
comprehend
for
your
eyes
are
set
upon
a
star
and
your
feet
move
in
the
blessed
kingdoms
of
the
shee
innocents
in
what
prisons
are
ye
flung
to
what
lowliness
are
ye
bowed
how
are
ye
ground
between
the
laws
and
the
customs
the
dark
people
of
the
fomor
have
ye
in
thrall
and
upon
your
minds
they
have
fastened
a
band
of
lead
your
hearts
are
hung
with
iron
and
about
your
loins
a
cincture
of
brass
impressed
woeful
believe
it
that
the
sun
does
shine
the
flowers
grow
and
the
birds
sing
pleasantly
in
the
trees
the
free
winds
are
everywhere
the
water
tumbles
on
the
hills
the
eagle
calls
aloud
through
the
solitude
and
his
mate
comes
speedily
the
bees
are
gathering
honey
in
the
sunlight
the
midges
dance
together
and
the
great
bull
bellows
across
the
river
the
crow
says
a
word
to
his
brethren
and
the
wren
snuggles
her
young
in
the
hedge
come
to
us
ye
lovers
of
life
and
happiness
hold
out
thy
hand
a
brother
shall
seize
it
from
afar
leave
the
plough
and
the
cart
for
a
little
time
put
aside
the
needle
and
the
awl
is
leather
thy
brother
o
man
come
away
come
away
from
the
loom
and
the
desk
from
the
shop
where
the
carcasses
are
hung
from
the
place
where
raiment
is
sold
and
the
place
where
it
is
sewn
in
darkness
o
bad
treachery
is
it
for
joy
you
sit
in
the
broker
s
den
thou
pale
man
has
the
attorney
enchanted
thee
come
away
for
the
dance
has
begun
lightly
the
wind
is
sounding
over
the
hill
the
sun
laughs
down
into
the
valley
and
the
sea
leaps
upon
the
shingle
panting
for
joy
dancing
dancing
dancing
for
joy
they
swept
through
the
goat
tracks
and
the
little
boreens
and
the
curving
roads
down
to
the
city
they
went
dancing
and
singing
among
the
streets
and
the
shops
telling
their
sunny
tale
not
heeding
the
malignant
eyes
and
the
cold
brows
as
the
sons
of
balor
looked
sidewards
and
they
took
the
philosopher
from
his
prison
even
the
intellect
of
man
they
took
from
the
hands
of
the
doctors
and
lawyers
from
the
sly
priests
from
the
professors
whose
mouths
are
gorged
with
sawdust
and
the
merchants
who
sell
blades
of
grass
the
awful
people
of
the
fomor
and
then
they
returned
again
dancing
and
singing
to
the
country
of
the
gods
