it
seems
impossible
to
separate
by
any
exact
line
the
genuine
writings
of
plato
from
the
spurious
the
only
external
evidence
to
them
which
is
of
much
value
is
that
of
aristotle
for
the
alexandrian
catalogues
of
a
century
later
include
manifest
forgeries
even
the
value
of
the
aristotelian
authority
is
a
good
deal
impaired
by
the
uncertainty
concerning
the
date
and
authorship
of
the
writings
which
are
ascribed
to
him
and
several
of
the
citations
of
aristotle
omit
the
name
of
plato
and
some
of
them
omit
the
name
of
the
dialogue
from
which
they
are
taken
prior
however
to
the
enquiry
about
the
writings
of
a
particular
author
general
considerations
which
equally
affect
all
evidence
to
the
genuineness
of
ancient
writings
are
the
following
shorter
works
are
more
likely
to
have
been
forged
or
to
have
received
an
erroneous
designation
than
longer
ones
and
some
kinds
of
composition
such
as
epistles
or
panegyrical
orations
are
more
liable
to
suspicion
than
others
those
again
which
have
a
taste
of
sophistry
in
them
or
the
ring
of
a
later
age
or
the
slighter
character
of
a
rhetorical
exercise
or
in
which
a
motive
or
some
affinity
to
spurious
writings
can
be
detected
or
which
seem
to
have
originated
in
a
name
or
statement
really
occurring
in
some
classical
author
are
also
of
doubtful
credit
while
there
is
no
instance
of
any
ancient
writing
proved
to
be
a
forgery
which
combines
excellence
with
length
a
really
great
and
original
writer
would
have
no
object
in
fathering
his
works
on
plato
and
to
the
forger
or
imitator
the
hack
of
alexandria
and
athens
the
gods
did
not
grant
originality
or
genius
further
in
attempting
to
balance
the
evidence
for
and
against
a
platonic
dialogue
we
must
not
forget
that
the
form
of
the
platonic
writing
was
common
to
several
of
his
contemporaries
aeschines
euclid
phaedo
antisthenes
and
in
the
next
generation
aristotle
are
all
said
to
have
composed
dialogues
and
mistakes
of
names
are
very
likely
to
have
occurred
greek
literature
in
the
third
century
before
christ
was
almost
as
voluminous
as
our
own
and
without
the
safeguards
of
regular
publication
or
printing
or
binding
or
even
of
distinct
titles
an
unknown
writing
was
naturally
attributed
to
a
known
writer
whose
works
bore
the
same
character
and
the
name
once
appended
easily
obtained
authority
a
tendency
may
also
be
observed
to
blend
the
works
and
opinions
of
the
master
with
those
of
his
scholars
to
a
later
platonist
the
difference
between
plato
and
his
imitators
was
not
so
perceptible
as
to
ourselves
the
memorabilia
of
xenophon
and
the
dialogues
of
plato
are
but
a
part
of
a
considerable
socratic
literature
which
has
passed
away
and
we
must
consider
how
we
should
regard
the
question
of
the
genuineness
of
a
particular
writing
if
this
lost
literature
had
been
preserved
to
us
these
considerations
lead
us
to
adopt
the
following
criteria
of
genuineness
that
is
most
certainly
plato
which
aristotle
attributes
to
him
by
name
which
is
of
considerable
length
of
great
excellence
and
also
in
harmony
with
the
general
spirit
of
the
platonic
writings
but
the
testimony
of
aristotle
can
not
always
be
distinguished
from
that
of
a
later
age
see
above
and
has
various
degrees
of
importance
those
writings
which
he
cites
without
mentioning
plato
under
their
own
names
the
hippias
the
funeral
oration
the
phaedo
have
an
inferior
degree
of
evidence
in
their
favour
they
may
have
been
supposed
by
him
to
be
the
writings
of
another
although
in
the
case
of
really
great
works
the
phaedo
this
is
not
credible
those
again
which
are
quoted
but
not
named
are
still
more
defective
in
their
external
credentials
there
may
be
also
a
possibility
that
aristotle
was
mistaken
or
may
have
confused
the
master
and
his
scholars
in
the
case
of
a
short
writing
but
this
is
inconceivable
about
a
more
important
work
the
laws
especially
when
we
remember
that
he
was
living
at
athens
and
a
frequenter
of
the
groves
of
the
academy
during
the
last
twenty
years
of
plato
life
nor
must
we
forget
that
in
all
his
numerous
citations
from
the
platonic
writings
he
never
attributes
any
passage
found
in
the
extant
dialogues
to
any
one
but
plato
and
lastly
we
may
remark
that
one
or
two
great
writings
such
as
the
parmenides
and
the
politicus
which
are
wholly
devoid
of
aristotelian
credentials
may
be
fairly
attributed
to
plato
on
the
ground
of
length
excellence
and
accordance
with
the
general
spirit
of
his
writings
indeed
the
greater
part
of
the
evidence
for
the
genuineness
of
ancient
greek
authors
may
be
summed
up
under
two
heads
only
excellence
and
uniformity
of
tradition
a
kind
of
evidence
which
though
in
many
cases
sufficient
is
of
inferior
value
proceeding
upon
these
principles
we
appear
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
of
all
the
writings
which
have
ever
been
ascribed
to
plato
are
undoubtedly
genuine
there
is
another
portion
of
them
including
the
epistles
the
epinomis
the
dialogues
rejected
by
the
ancients
themselves
namely
the
axiochus
de
justo
de
virtute
demodocus
sisyphus
eryxias
which
on
grounds
both
of
internal
and
external
evidence
we
are
able
with
equal
certainty
to
reject
but
there
still
remains
a
small
portion
of
which
we
are
unable
to
affirm
either
that
they
are
genuine
or
spurious
they
may
have
been
written
in
youth
or
possibly
like
the
works
of
some
painters
may
be
partly
or
wholly
the
compositions
of
pupils
or
they
may
have
been
the
writings
of
some
contemporary
transferred
by
accident
to
the
more
celebrated
name
of
plato
or
of
some
platonist
in
the
next
generation
who
aspired
to
imitate
his
master
not
that
on
grounds
either
of
language
or
philosophy
we
should
lightly
reject
them
some
difference
of
style
or
inferiority
of
execution
or
inconsistency
of
thought
can
hardly
be
considered
decisive
of
their
spurious
character
for
who
always
does
justice
to
himself
or
who
writes
with
equal
care
at
all
times
certainly
not
plato
who
exhibits
the
greatest
differences
in
dramatic
power
in
the
formation
of
sentences
and
in
the
use
of
words
if
his
earlier
writings
are
compared
with
his
later
ones
say
the
protagoras
or
phaedrus
with
the
laws
or
who
can
be
expected
to
think
in
the
same
manner
during
a
period
of
authorship
extending
over
above
fifty
years
in
an
age
of
great
intellectual
activity
as
well
as
of
political
and
literary
transition
certainly
not
plato
whose
earlier
writings
are
separated
from
his
later
ones
by
as
wide
an
interval
of
philosophical
speculation
as
that
which
separates
his
later
writings
from
aristotle
the
dialogues
which
have
been
translated
in
the
first
appendix
and
which
appear
to
have
the
next
claim
to
genuineness
among
the
platonic
writings
are
the
lesser
hippias
the
menexenus
or
funeral
oration
the
first
alcibiades
of
these
the
lesser
hippias
and
the
funeral
oration
are
cited
by
aristotle
the
first
in
the
metaphysics
the
latter
in
the
rhetoric
neither
of
them
are
expressly
attributed
to
plato
but
in
his
citation
of
both
of
them
he
seems
to
be
referring
to
passages
in
the
extant
dialogues
from
the
mention
of
in
the
singular
by
aristotle
we
may
perhaps
infer
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
a
second
dialogue
bearing
the
same
name
moreover
the
mere
existence
of
a
greater
and
lesser
hippias
and
of
a
first
and
second
alcibiades
does
to
a
certain
extent
throw
a
doubt
upon
both
of
them
though
a
very
clever
and
ingenious
work
the
lesser
hippias
does
not
appear
to
contain
anything
beyond
the
power
of
an
imitator
who
was
also
a
careful
student
of
the
earlier
platonic
writings
to
invent
the
motive
or
leading
thought
of
the
dialogue
may
be
detected
in
xen
and
there
is
no
similar
instance
of
a
which
is
taken
from
xenophon
in
an
undoubted
dialogue
of
plato
on
the
other
hand
the
upholders
of
the
genuineness
of
the
dialogue
will
find
in
the
hippias
a
true
socratic
spirit
they
will
compare
the
ion
as
being
akin
both
in
subject
and
treatment
they
will
urge
the
authority
of
aristotle
and
they
will
detect
in
the
treatment
of
the
sophist
in
the
satirical
reasoning
upon
homer
in
the
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
the
doctrine
that
vice
is
ignorance
traces
of
a
platonic
authorship
in
reference
to
the
last
point
we
are
doubtful
as
in
some
of
the
other
dialogues
whether
the
author
is
asserting
or
overthrowing
the
paradox
of
socrates
or
merely
following
the
argument
the
wind
blows
that
no
conclusion
is
arrived
at
is
also
in
accordance
with
the
character
of
the
earlier
dialogues
the
resemblances
or
imitations
of
the
gorgias
protagoras
and
euthydemus
which
have
been
observed
in
the
hippias
can
not
with
certainty
be
adduced
on
either
side
of
the
argument
on
the
whole
more
may
be
said
in
favour
of
the
genuineness
of
the
hippias
than
against
it
the
menexenus
or
funeral
oration
is
cited
by
aristotle
and
is
interesting
as
supplying
an
example
of
the
manner
in
which
the
orators
praised
athenians
among
the
athenians
falsifying
persons
and
dates
and
casting
a
veil
over
the
gloomier
events
of
athenian
history
it
exhibits
an
acquaintance
with
the
funeral
oration
of
thucydides
and
was
perhaps
intended
to
rival
that
great
work
if
genuine
the
proper
place
of
the
menexenus
would
be
at
the
end
of
the
phaedrus
the
satirical
opening
and
the
concluding
words
bear
a
great
resemblance
to
the
earlier
dialogues
the
oration
itself
is
professedly
a
mimetic
work
like
the
speeches
in
the
phaedrus
and
can
not
therefore
be
tested
by
a
comparison
of
the
other
writings
of
plato
the
funeral
oration
of
pericles
is
expressly
mentioned
in
the
phaedrus
and
this
may
have
suggested
the
subject
in
the
same
manner
that
the
cleitophon
appears
to
be
suggested
by
the
slight
mention
of
cleitophon
and
his
attachment
to
thrasymachus
in
the
republic
and
the
theages
by
the
mention
of
theages
in
the
apology
and
republic
or
as
the
second
alcibiades
seems
to
be
founded
upon
the
text
of
xenophon
mem
a
similar
taste
for
parody
appears
not
only
in
the
phaedrus
but
in
the
protagoras
in
the
symposium
and
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
parmenides
to
these
two
doubtful
writings
of
plato
i
have
added
the
first
alcibiades
which
of
all
the
disputed
dialogues
of
plato
has
the
greatest
merit
and
is
somewhat
longer
than
any
of
them
though
not
verified
by
the
testimony
of
aristotle
and
in
many
respects
at
variance
with
the
symposium
in
the
description
of
the
relations
of
socrates
and
alcibiades
like
the
lesser
hippias
and
the
menexenus
it
is
to
be
compared
to
the
earlier
writings
of
plato
the
motive
of
the
piece
may
perhaps
be
found
in
that
passage
of
the
symposium
in
which
alcibiades
describes
himself
as
by
the
words
of
socrates
for
the
disparaging
manner
in
which
schleiermacher
has
spoken
of
this
dialogue
there
seems
to
be
no
sufficient
foundation
at
the
same
time
the
lesson
imparted
is
simple
and
the
irony
more
transparent
than
in
the
undoubted
dialogues
of
plato
we
know
too
that
alcibiades
was
a
favourite
thesis
and
that
at
least
five
or
six
dialogues
bearing
this
name
passed
current
in
antiquity
and
are
attributed
to
contemporaries
of
socrates
and
plato
in
the
entire
absence
of
real
external
evidence
for
the
catalogues
of
the
alexandrian
librarians
can
not
be
regarded
as
trustworthy
and
in
the
absence
of
the
highest
marks
either
of
poetical
or
philosophical
excellence
and
considering
that
we
have
express
testimony
to
the
existence
of
contemporary
writings
bearing
the
name
of
alcibiades
we
are
compelled
to
suspend
our
judgment
on
the
genuineness
of
the
extant
dialogue
neither
at
this
point
nor
at
any
other
do
we
propose
to
draw
an
absolute
line
of
demarcation
between
genuine
and
spurious
writings
of
plato
they
fade
off
imperceptibly
from
one
class
to
another
there
may
have
been
degrees
of
genuineness
in
the
dialogues
themselves
as
there
are
certainly
degrees
of
evidence
by
which
they
are
supported
the
traditions
of
the
oral
discourses
both
of
socrates
and
plato
may
have
formed
the
basis
of
writings
some
of
them
may
be
of
the
same
mixed
character
which
is
apparent
in
aristotle
and
hippocrates
although
the
form
of
them
is
different
but
the
writings
of
plato
unlike
the
writings
of
aristotle
seem
never
to
have
been
confused
with
the
writings
of
his
disciples
this
was
probably
due
to
their
definite
form
and
to
their
inimitable
excellence
the
three
dialogues
which
we
have
offered
in
the
appendix
to
the
criticism
of
the
reader
may
be
partly
spurious
and
partly
genuine
they
may
be
altogether
spurious
that
is
an
alternative
which
must
be
frankly
admitted
nor
can
we
maintain
of
some
other
dialogues
such
as
the
parmenides
and
the
sophist
and
politicus
that
no
considerable
objection
can
be
urged
against
them
though
greatly
overbalanced
by
the
weight
chiefly
of
internal
evidence
in
their
favour
nor
on
the
other
hand
can
we
exclude
a
bare
possibility
that
some
dialogues
which
are
usually
rejected
such
as
the
greater
hippias
and
the
cleitophon
may
be
genuine
the
nature
and
object
of
these
writings
require
more
careful
study
and
more
comparison
of
them
with
one
another
and
with
forged
writings
in
general
than
they
have
yet
received
before
we
can
finally
decide
on
their
character
we
do
not
consider
them
all
as
genuine
until
they
can
be
proved
to
be
spurious
as
is
often
maintained
and
still
more
often
implied
in
this
and
similar
discussions
but
should
say
of
some
of
them
that
their
genuineness
is
neither
proven
nor
disproven
until
further
evidence
about
them
can
be
adduced
and
we
are
as
confident
that
the
epistles
are
spurious
as
that
the
republic
the
timaeus
and
the
laws
are
genuine
on
the
whole
not
a
twentieth
part
of
the
writings
which
pass
under
the
name
of
plato
if
we
exclude
the
works
rejected
by
the
ancients
themselves
and
two
or
three
other
plausible
inventions
can
be
fairly
doubted
by
those
who
are
willing
to
allow
that
a
considerable
change
and
growth
may
have
taken
place
in
his
philosophy
see
above
that
twentieth
debatable
portion
scarcely
in
any
degree
affects
our
judgment
of
plato
either
as
a
thinker
or
a
writer
and
though
suggesting
some
interesting
questions
to
the
scholar
and
critic
is
of
little
importance
to
the
general
reader
alcibiades
i
by
plato
see
appendix
i
above
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
the
first
alcibiades
is
a
conversation
between
socrates
and
alcibiades
socrates
is
represented
in
the
character
which
he
attributes
to
himself
in
the
apology
of
a
who
detects
the
conceit
of
knowledge
in
others
the
two
have
met
already
in
the
protagoras
and
in
the
symposium
in
the
latter
dialogue
as
in
this
the
relation
between
them
is
that
of
a
lover
and
his
beloved
but
the
narrative
of
their
loves
is
told
differently
in
different
places
for
in
the
symposium
alcibiades
is
depicted
as
the
impassioned
but
rejected
lover
here
as
coldly
receiving
the
advances
of
socrates
who
for
the
best
of
purposes
lies
in
wait
for
the
aspiring
and
ambitious
youth
alcibiades
who
is
described
as
a
very
young
man
is
about
to
enter
on
public
life
having
an
inordinate
opinion
of
himself
and
an
extravagant
ambition
socrates
knows
what
is
in
man
astonishes
him
by
a
revelation
of
his
designs
but
has
he
the
knowledge
which
is
necessary
for
carrying
them
out
he
is
going
to
persuade
the
athenians
about
what
not
about
any
particular
art
but
about
politics
when
to
fight
and
when
to
make
peace
now
men
should
fight
and
make
peace
on
just
grounds
and
therefore
the
question
of
justice
and
injustice
must
enter
into
peace
and
war
and
he
who
advises
the
athenians
must
know
the
difference
between
them
does
alcibiades
know
if
he
does
he
must
either
have
been
taught
by
some
master
or
he
must
have
discovered
the
nature
of
them
himself
if
he
has
had
a
master
socrates
would
like
to
be
informed
who
he
is
that
he
may
go
and
learn
of
him
also
alcibiades
admits
that
he
has
never
learned
then
has
he
enquired
for
himself
he
may
have
if
he
was
ever
aware
of
a
time
when
he
was
ignorant
but
he
never
was
ignorant
for
when
he
played
with
other
boys
at
dice
he
charged
them
with
cheating
and
this
implied
a
knowledge
of
just
and
unjust
according
to
his
own
explanation
he
had
learned
of
the
multitude
why
he
asks
should
he
not
learn
of
them
the
nature
of
justice
as
he
has
learned
the
greek
language
of
them
to
this
socrates
answers
that
they
can
teach
greek
but
they
can
not
teach
justice
for
they
are
agreed
about
the
one
but
they
are
not
agreed
about
the
other
and
therefore
alcibiades
who
has
admitted
that
if
he
knows
he
must
either
have
learned
from
a
master
or
have
discovered
for
himself
the
nature
of
justice
is
convicted
out
of
his
own
mouth
alcibiades
rejoins
that
the
athenians
debate
not
about
what
is
just
but
about
what
is
expedient
and
he
asserts
that
the
two
principles
of
justice
and
expediency
are
opposed
socrates
by
a
series
of
questions
compels
him
to
admit
that
the
just
and
the
expedient
coincide
alcibiades
is
thus
reduced
to
the
humiliating
conclusion
that
he
knows
nothing
of
politics
even
if
as
he
says
they
are
concerned
with
the
expedient
however
he
is
no
worse
than
other
athenian
statesmen
and
he
will
not
need
training
for
others
are
as
ignorant
as
he
is
he
is
reminded
that
he
has
to
contend
not
only
with
his
own
countrymen
but
with
their
enemies
with
the
spartan
kings
and
with
the
great
king
of
persia
and
he
can
only
attain
this
higher
aim
of
ambition
by
the
assistance
of
socrates
not
that
socrates
himself
professes
to
have
attained
the
truth
but
the
questions
which
he
asks
bring
others
to
a
knowledge
of
themselves
and
this
is
the
first
step
in
the
practice
of
virtue
the
dialogue
continues
we
wish
to
become
as
good
as
possible
but
to
be
good
in
what
alcibiades
replies
in
transacting
business
but
what
business
business
of
the
most
intelligent
men
at
athens
the
cobbler
is
intelligent
in
shoemaking
and
is
therefore
good
in
that
he
is
not
intelligent
and
therefore
not
good
in
weaving
is
he
good
in
the
sense
which
alcibiades
means
who
is
also
bad
mean
replies
alcibiades
man
who
is
able
to
command
in
the
city
but
to
command
what
horses
or
men
and
if
men
under
what
circumstances
mean
to
say
that
he
is
able
to
command
men
living
in
social
and
political
relations
and
what
is
their
aim
better
preservation
of
the
city
but
when
is
a
city
better
there
is
unanimity
such
as
exists
between
husband
and
wife
then
when
husbands
and
wives
perform
their
own
special
duties
there
can
be
no
unanimity
between
them
nor
can
a
city
be
well
ordered
when
each
citizen
does
his
own
work
only
alcibiades
having
stated
first
that
goodness
consists
in
the
unanimity
of
the
citizens
and
then
in
each
of
them
doing
his
own
separate
work
is
brought
to
the
required
point
of
leading
him
to
confess
his
own
ignorance
but
he
is
not
too
old
to
learn
and
may
still
arrive
at
the
truth
if
he
is
willing
to
be
by
socrates
he
must
know
himself
that
is
to
say
not
his
body
or
the
things
of
the
body
but
his
mind
or
truer
self
the
physician
knows
the
body
and
the
tradesman
knows
his
own
business
but
they
do
not
necessarily
know
themselves
can
be
obtained
only
by
looking
into
the
mind
and
virtue
of
the
soul
which
is
the
diviner
part
of
a
man
as
we
see
our
own
image
in
another
eye
and
if
we
do
not
know
ourselves
we
can
not
know
what
belongs
to
ourselves
or
belongs
to
others
and
are
unfit
to
take
a
part
in
political
affairs
both
for
the
sake
of
the
individual
and
of
the
state
we
ought
to
aim
at
justice
and
temperance
not
at
wealth
or
power
the
evil
and
unjust
should
have
no
power
they
should
be
the
slaves
of
better
men
than
themselves
none
but
the
virtuous
are
deserving
of
freedom
and
are
you
alcibiades
a
freeman
feel
that
i
am
not
but
i
hope
socrates
that
by
your
aid
i
may
become
free
and
from
this
day
forward
i
will
never
leave
you
the
alcibiades
has
several
points
of
resemblance
to
the
undoubted
dialogues
of
plato
the
process
of
interrogation
is
of
the
same
kind
with
that
which
socrates
practises
upon
the
youthful
cleinias
in
the
euthydemus
and
he
characteristically
attributes
to
alcibiades
the
answers
which
he
has
elicited
from
him
the
definition
of
good
is
narrowed
by
successive
questions
and
virtue
is
shown
to
be
identical
with
knowledge
here
as
elsewhere
socrates
awakens
the
consciousness
not
of
sin
but
of
ignorance
is
the
first
step
to
knowledge
even
of
the
commonest
things
no
man
knows
how
ignorant
he
is
and
no
man
can
arrive
at
virtue
and
wisdom
who
has
not
once
in
his
life
at
least
been
convicted
of
error
the
process
by
which
the
soul
is
elevated
is
not
unlike
that
which
religious
writers
describe
under
the
name
of
if
we
substitute
the
sense
of
ignorance
for
the
consciousness
of
sin
in
some
respects
the
dialogue
differs
from
any
other
platonic
composition
the
aim
is
more
directly
ethical
and
hortatory
the
process
by
which
the
antagonist
is
undermined
is
simpler
than
in
other
platonic
writings
and
the
conclusion
more
decided
there
is
a
good
deal
of
humour
in
the
manner
in
which
the
pride
of
alcibiades
and
of
the
greeks
generally
is
supposed
to
be
taken
down
by
the
spartan
and
persian
queens
and
the
dialogue
has
considerable
dialectical
merit
but
we
have
a
difficulty
in
supposing
that
the
same
writer
who
has
given
so
profound
and
complex
a
notion
of
the
characters
both
of
alcibiades
and
socrates
in
the
symposium
should
have
treated
them
in
so
thin
and
superficial
a
manner
in
the
alcibiades
or
that
he
would
have
ascribed
to
the
ironical
socrates
the
rather
unmeaning
boast
that
alcibiades
could
not
attain
the
objects
of
his
ambition
without
his
help
or
that
he
should
have
imagined
that
a
mighty
nature
like
his
could
have
been
reformed
by
a
few
not
very
conclusive
words
of
socrates
for
the
arguments
by
which
alcibiades
is
reformed
are
not
convincing
the
writer
of
the
dialogue
whoever
he
was
arrives
at
his
idealism
by
crooked
and
tortuous
paths
in
which
many
pitfalls
are
concealed
the
anachronism
of
making
alcibiades
about
twenty
years
old
during
the
life
of
his
uncle
pericles
may
be
noted
and
the
repetition
of
the
favourite
observation
which
occurs
also
in
the
laches
and
protagoras
that
great
athenian
statesmen
like
pericles
failed
in
the
education
of
their
sons
there
is
none
of
the
undoubted
dialogues
of
plato
in
which
there
is
so
little
dramatic
verisimilitude
alcibiades
i
by
plato
see
appendix
i
above
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
persons
of
the
dialogue
alcibiades
socrates
socrates
i
dare
say
that
you
may
be
surprised
to
find
o
son
of
cleinias
that
i
who
am
your
first
lover
not
having
spoken
to
you
for
many
years
when
the
rest
of
the
world
were
wearying
you
with
their
attentions
am
the
last
of
your
lovers
who
still
speaks
to
you
the
cause
of
my
silence
has
been
that
i
was
hindered
by
a
power
more
than
human
of
which
i
will
some
day
explain
to
you
the
nature
this
impediment
has
now
been
removed
i
therefore
here
present
myself
before
you
and
i
greatly
hope
that
no
similar
hindrance
will
again
occur
meanwhile
i
have
observed
that
your
pride
has
been
too
much
for
the
pride
of
your
admirers
they
were
numerous
and
but
they
have
all
run
away
overpowered
by
your
superior
force
of
character
not
one
of
them
remains
and
i
want
you
to
understand
the
reason
why
you
have
been
too
much
for
them
you
think
that
you
have
no
need
of
them
or
of
any
other
man
for
you
have
great
possessions
and
lack
nothing
beginning
with
the
body
and
ending
with
the
soul
in
the
first
place
you
say
to
yourself
that
you
are
the
fairest
and
tallest
of
the
citizens
and
this
every
one
who
has
eyes
may
see
to
be
true
in
the
second
place
that
you
are
among
the
noblest
of
them
highly
connected
both
on
the
father
and
the
mother
side
and
sprung
from
one
of
the
most
distinguished
families
in
your
own
state
which
is
the
greatest
in
hellas
and
having
many
friends
and
kinsmen
of
the
best
sort
who
can
assist
you
when
in
need
and
there
is
one
potent
relative
who
is
more
to
you
than
all
the
rest
pericles
the
son
of
xanthippus
whom
your
father
left
guardian
of
you
and
of
your
brother
and
who
can
do
as
he
pleases
not
only
in
this
city
but
in
all
hellas
and
among
many
and
mighty
barbarous
nations
moreover
you
are
rich
but
i
must
say
that
you
value
yourself
least
of
all
upon
your
possessions
and
all
these
things
have
lifted
you
up
you
have
overcome
your
lovers
and
they
have
acknowledged
that
you
were
too
much
for
them
have
you
not
remarked
their
absence
and
now
i
know
that
you
wonder
why
i
unlike
the
rest
of
them
have
not
gone
away
and
what
can
be
my
motive
in
remaining
alcibiades
perhaps
socrates
you
are
not
aware
that
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
the
very
same
question
what
do
you
want
and
what
is
your
motive
in
annoying
me
and
always
wherever
i
am
making
a
point
of
coming
compare
symp
i
do
really
wonder
what
you
mean
and
should
greatly
like
to
know
socrates
then
if
as
you
say
you
desire
to
know
i
suppose
that
you
will
be
willing
to
hear
and
i
may
consider
myself
to
be
speaking
to
an
auditor
who
will
remain
and
will
not
run
away
alcibiades
certainly
let
me
hear
socrates
you
had
better
be
careful
for
i
may
very
likely
be
as
unwilling
to
end
as
i
have
hitherto
been
to
begin
alcibiades
proceed
my
good
man
and
i
will
listen
socrates
i
will
proceed
and
although
no
lover
likes
to
speak
with
one
who
has
no
feeling
of
love
in
him
compare
symp
i
will
make
an
effort
and
tell
you
what
i
meant
my
love
alcibiades
which
i
hardly
like
to
confess
would
long
ago
have
passed
away
as
i
flatter
myself
if
i
saw
you
loving
your
good
things
or
thinking
that
you
ought
to
pass
life
in
the
enjoyment
of
them
but
i
shall
reveal
other
thoughts
of
yours
which
you
keep
to
yourself
whereby
you
will
know
that
i
have
always
had
my
eye
on
you
suppose
that
at
this
moment
some
god
came
to
you
and
said
alcibiades
will
you
live
as
you
are
or
die
in
an
instant
if
you
are
forbidden
to
make
any
further
acquisition
i
verily
believe
that
you
would
choose
death
and
i
will
tell
you
the
hope
in
which
you
are
at
present
living
before
many
days
have
elapsed
you
think
that
you
will
come
before
the
athenian
assembly
and
will
prove
to
them
that
you
are
more
worthy
of
honour
than
pericles
or
any
other
man
that
ever
lived
and
having
proved
this
you
will
have
the
greatest
power
in
the
state
when
you
have
gained
the
greatest
power
among
us
you
will
go
on
to
other
hellenic
states
and
not
only
to
hellenes
but
to
all
the
barbarians
who
inhabit
the
same
continent
with
us
and
if
the
god
were
then
to
say
to
you
again
here
in
europe
is
to
be
your
seat
of
empire
and
you
must
not
cross
over
into
asia
or
meddle
with
asiatic
affairs
i
do
not
believe
that
you
would
choose
to
live
upon
these
terms
but
the
world
as
i
may
say
must
be
filled
with
your
power
and
name
no
man
less
than
cyrus
and
xerxes
is
of
any
account
with
you
such
i
know
to
be
your
hopes
i
am
not
guessing
only
and
very
likely
you
who
know
that
i
am
speaking
the
truth
will
reply
well
socrates
but
what
have
my
hopes
to
do
with
the
explanation
which
you
promised
of
your
unwillingness
to
leave
me
and
that
is
what
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
sweet
son
of
cleinias
and
dinomache
the
explanation
is
that
all
these
designs
of
yours
can
not
be
accomplished
by
you
without
my
help
so
great
is
the
power
which
i
believe
myself
to
have
over
you
and
your
concerns
and
this
i
conceive
to
be
the
reason
why
the
god
has
hitherto
forbidden
me
to
converse
with
you
and
i
have
been
long
expecting
his
permission
for
as
you
hope
to
prove
your
own
great
value
to
the
state
and
having
proved
it
to
attain
at
once
to
absolute
power
so
do
i
indulge
a
hope
that
i
shall
be
the
supreme
power
over
you
if
i
am
able
to
prove
my
own
great
value
to
you
and
to
show
you
that
neither
guardian
nor
kinsman
nor
any
one
is
able
to
deliver
into
your
hands
the
power
which
you
desire
but
i
only
god
being
my
helper
when
you
were
young
compare
symp
and
your
hopes
were
not
yet
matured
i
should
have
wasted
my
time
and
therefore
as
i
conceive
the
god
forbade
me
to
converse
with
you
but
now
having
his
permission
i
will
speak
for
now
you
will
listen
to
me
alcibiades
your
silence
socrates
was
always
a
surprise
to
me
i
never
could
understand
why
you
followed
me
about
and
now
that
you
have
begun
to
speak
again
i
am
still
more
amazed
whether
i
think
all
this
or
not
is
a
matter
about
which
you
seem
to
have
already
made
up
your
mind
and
therefore
my
denial
will
have
no
effect
upon
you
but
granting
if
i
must
that
you
have
perfectly
divined
my
purposes
why
is
your
assistance
necessary
to
the
attainment
of
them
can
you
tell
me
why
socrates
you
want
to
know
whether
i
can
make
a
long
speech
such
as
you
are
in
the
habit
of
hearing
but
that
is
not
my
way
i
think
however
that
i
can
prove
to
you
the
truth
of
what
i
am
saying
if
you
will
grant
me
one
little
favour
alcibiades
yes
if
the
favour
which
you
mean
be
not
a
troublesome
one
socrates
will
you
be
troubled
at
having
questions
to
answer
alcibiades
not
at
all
socrates
then
please
to
answer
alcibiades
ask
me
socrates
have
you
not
the
intention
which
i
attribute
to
you
alcibiades
i
will
grant
anything
you
like
in
the
hope
of
hearing
what
more
you
have
to
say
socrates
you
do
then
mean
as
i
was
saying
to
come
forward
in
a
little
while
in
the
character
of
an
adviser
of
the
athenians
and
suppose
that
when
you
are
ascending
the
bema
i
pull
you
by
the
sleeve
and
say
alcibiades
you
are
getting
up
to
advise
the
athenians
do
you
know
the
matter
about
which
they
are
going
to
deliberate
better
than
they
how
would
you
answer
alcibiades
i
should
reply
that
i
was
going
to
advise
them
about
a
matter
which
i
do
know
better
than
they
socrates
then
you
are
a
good
adviser
about
the
things
which
you
know
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
do
you
know
anything
but
what
you
have
learned
of
others
or
found
out
yourself
alcibiades
that
is
all
socrates
and
would
you
have
ever
learned
or
discovered
anything
if
you
had
not
been
willing
either
to
learn
of
others
or
to
examine
yourself
alcibiades
i
should
not
socrates
and
would
you
have
been
willing
to
learn
or
to
examine
what
you
supposed
that
you
knew
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
then
there
was
a
time
when
you
thought
that
you
did
not
know
what
you
are
now
supposed
to
know
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
i
think
that
i
know
tolerably
well
the
extent
of
your
acquirements
and
you
must
tell
me
if
i
forget
any
of
them
according
to
my
recollection
you
learned
the
arts
of
writing
of
playing
on
the
lyre
and
of
wrestling
the
flute
you
never
would
learn
this
is
the
sum
of
your
accomplishments
unless
there
were
some
which
you
acquired
in
secret
and
i
think
that
secrecy
was
hardly
possible
as
you
could
not
have
come
out
of
your
door
either
by
day
or
night
without
my
seeing
you
alcibiades
yes
that
was
the
whole
of
my
schooling
socrates
and
are
you
going
to
get
up
in
the
athenian
assembly
and
give
them
advice
about
writing
alcibiades
no
indeed
socrates
or
about
the
touch
of
the
lyre
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
and
they
are
not
in
the
habit
of
deliberating
about
wrestling
in
the
assembly
alcibiades
hardly
socrates
then
what
are
the
deliberations
in
which
you
propose
to
advise
them
surely
not
about
building
alcibiades
no
socrates
for
the
builder
will
advise
better
than
you
will
about
that
alcibiades
he
will
socrates
nor
about
divination
alcibiades
no
socrates
about
that
again
the
diviner
will
advise
better
than
you
will
alcibiades
true
socrates
whether
he
be
little
or
great
good
or
noble
or
ignoble
makes
no
difference
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
a
man
is
a
good
adviser
about
anything
not
because
he
has
riches
but
because
he
has
knowledge
alcibiades
assuredly
socrates
whether
their
counsellor
is
rich
or
poor
is
not
a
matter
which
will
make
any
difference
to
the
athenians
when
they
are
deliberating
about
the
health
of
the
citizens
they
only
require
that
he
should
be
a
physician
alcibiades
of
course
socrates
then
what
will
be
the
subject
of
deliberation
about
which
you
will
be
justified
in
getting
up
and
advising
them
alcibiades
about
their
own
concerns
socrates
socrates
you
mean
about
shipbuilding
for
example
when
the
question
is
what
sort
of
ships
they
ought
to
build
alcibiades
no
i
should
not
advise
them
about
that
socrates
i
suppose
because
you
do
not
understand
shipbuilding
is
that
the
reason
alcibiades
it
is
socrates
then
about
what
concerns
of
theirs
will
you
advise
them
alcibiades
about
war
socrates
or
about
peace
or
about
any
other
concerns
of
the
state
socrates
you
mean
when
they
deliberate
with
whom
they
ought
to
make
peace
and
with
whom
they
ought
to
go
to
war
and
in
what
manner
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
they
ought
to
go
to
war
with
those
against
whom
it
is
better
to
go
to
war
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
when
it
is
better
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
for
as
long
a
time
as
is
better
alcibiades
yes
socrates
but
suppose
the
athenians
to
deliberate
with
whom
they
ought
to
close
in
wrestling
and
whom
they
should
grasp
by
the
hand
would
you
or
the
master
of
gymnastics
be
a
better
adviser
of
them
alcibiades
clearly
the
master
of
gymnastics
socrates
and
can
you
tell
me
on
what
grounds
the
master
of
gymnastics
would
decide
with
whom
they
ought
or
ought
not
to
close
and
when
and
how
to
take
an
instance
would
he
not
say
that
they
should
wrestle
with
those
against
whom
it
is
best
to
wrestle
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
as
much
as
is
best
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
at
such
times
as
are
best
alcibiades
yes
socrates
again
you
sometimes
accompany
the
lyre
with
the
song
and
dance
alcibiades
yes
socrates
when
it
is
well
to
do
so
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
as
much
as
is
well
alcibiades
just
so
socrates
and
as
you
speak
of
an
excellence
or
art
of
the
best
in
wrestling
and
of
an
excellence
in
playing
the
lyre
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
this
latter
is
the
excellence
of
wrestling
i
call
gymnastic
and
i
want
to
know
what
you
call
the
other
alcibiades
i
do
not
understand
you
socrates
then
try
to
do
as
i
do
for
the
answer
which
i
gave
is
universally
right
and
when
i
say
right
i
mean
according
to
rule
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
was
not
the
art
of
which
i
spoke
gymnastic
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
i
called
the
excellence
in
wrestling
gymnastic
alcibiades
you
did
socrates
and
i
was
right
alcibiades
i
think
that
you
were
socrates
well
now
for
you
should
learn
to
argue
prettily
let
me
ask
you
in
return
to
tell
me
first
what
is
that
art
of
which
playing
and
singing
and
stepping
properly
in
the
dance
are
parts
what
is
the
name
of
the
whole
i
think
that
by
this
time
you
must
be
able
to
tell
alcibiades
indeed
i
can
not
socrates
then
let
me
put
the
matter
in
another
way
what
do
you
call
the
goddesses
who
are
the
patronesses
of
art
alcibiades
the
muses
do
you
mean
socrates
socrates
yes
i
do
and
what
is
the
name
of
the
art
which
is
called
after
them
alcibiades
i
suppose
that
you
mean
music
socrates
yes
that
is
my
meaning
and
what
is
the
excellence
of
the
art
of
music
as
i
told
you
truly
that
the
excellence
of
wrestling
was
gymnastic
what
is
the
excellence
of
music
to
be
what
alcibiades
to
be
musical
i
suppose
socrates
very
good
and
now
please
to
tell
me
what
is
the
excellence
of
war
and
peace
as
the
more
musical
was
the
more
excellent
or
the
more
gymnastical
was
the
more
excellent
tell
me
what
name
do
you
give
to
the
more
excellent
in
war
and
peace
alcibiades
but
i
really
can
not
tell
you
socrates
but
if
you
were
offering
advice
to
another
and
said
to
him
this
food
is
better
than
that
at
this
time
and
in
this
quantity
and
he
said
to
you
what
do
you
mean
alcibiades
by
the
word
you
would
have
no
difficulty
in
replying
that
you
meant
wholesome
although
you
do
not
profess
to
be
a
physician
and
when
the
subject
is
one
of
which
you
profess
to
have
knowledge
and
about
which
you
are
ready
to
get
up
and
advise
as
if
you
knew
are
you
not
ashamed
when
you
are
asked
not
to
be
able
to
answer
the
question
is
it
not
disgraceful
alcibiades
very
socrates
well
then
consider
and
try
to
explain
what
is
the
meaning
of
in
the
matter
of
making
peace
and
going
to
war
with
those
against
whom
you
ought
to
go
to
war
to
what
does
the
word
refer
alcibiades
i
am
thinking
and
i
can
not
tell
socrates
but
you
surely
know
what
are
the
charges
which
we
bring
against
one
another
when
we
arrive
at
the
point
of
making
war
and
what
name
we
give
them
alcibiades
yes
certainly
we
say
that
deceit
or
violence
has
been
employed
or
that
we
have
been
defrauded
socrates
and
how
does
this
happen
will
you
tell
me
how
for
there
may
be
a
difference
in
the
manner
alcibiades
do
you
mean
by
socrates
whether
we
suffered
these
things
justly
or
unjustly
socrates
exactly
alcibiades
there
can
be
no
greater
difference
than
between
just
and
unjust
socrates
and
would
you
advise
the
athenians
to
go
to
war
with
the
just
or
with
the
unjust
alcibiades
that
is
an
awkward
question
for
certainly
even
if
a
person
did
intend
to
go
to
war
with
the
just
he
would
not
admit
that
they
were
just
socrates
he
would
not
go
to
war
because
it
would
be
unlawful
alcibiades
neither
lawful
nor
honourable
socrates
then
you
too
would
address
them
on
principles
of
justice
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
what
then
is
justice
but
that
better
of
which
i
spoke
in
going
to
war
or
not
going
to
war
with
those
against
whom
we
ought
or
ought
not
and
when
we
ought
or
ought
not
to
go
to
war
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
but
how
is
this
friend
alcibiades
have
you
forgotten
that
you
do
not
know
this
or
have
you
been
to
the
schoolmaster
without
my
knowledge
and
has
he
taught
you
to
discern
the
just
from
the
unjust
who
is
he
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
that
i
may
go
and
learn
of
him
you
shall
introduce
me
alcibiades
you
are
mocking
socrates
socrates
no
indeed
i
most
solemnly
declare
to
you
by
zeus
who
is
the
god
of
our
common
friendship
and
whom
i
never
will
forswear
that
i
am
not
tell
me
then
who
this
instructor
is
if
he
exists
alcibiades
but
perhaps
he
does
not
exist
may
i
not
have
acquired
the
knowledge
of
just
and
unjust
in
some
other
way
socrates
yes
if
you
have
discovered
them
alcibiades
but
do
you
not
think
that
i
could
discover
them
socrates
i
am
sure
that
you
might
if
you
enquired
about
them
alcibiades
and
do
you
not
think
that
i
would
enquire
socrates
yes
if
you
thought
that
you
did
not
know
them
alcibiades
and
was
there
not
a
time
when
i
did
so
think
socrates
very
good
and
can
you
tell
me
how
long
it
is
since
you
thought
that
you
did
not
know
the
nature
of
the
just
and
the
unjust
what
do
you
say
to
a
year
ago
were
you
then
in
a
state
of
conscious
ignorance
and
enquiry
or
did
you
think
that
you
knew
and
please
to
answer
truly
that
our
discussion
may
not
be
in
vain
alcibiades
well
i
thought
that
i
knew
socrates
and
two
years
ago
and
three
years
ago
and
four
years
ago
you
knew
all
the
same
alcibiades
i
did
socrates
and
more
than
four
years
ago
you
were
a
child
were
you
not
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
then
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
thought
you
knew
alcibiades
why
are
you
so
sure
socrates
because
i
often
heard
you
when
a
child
in
your
house
or
elsewhere
playing
at
dice
or
some
other
game
with
the
boys
not
hesitating
at
all
about
the
nature
of
the
just
and
unjust
but
very
confident
crying
and
shouting
that
one
of
the
boys
was
a
rogue
and
a
cheat
and
had
been
cheating
is
it
not
true
alcibiades
but
what
was
i
to
do
socrates
when
anybody
cheated
me
socrates
and
how
can
you
say
was
i
to
do
if
at
the
time
you
did
not
know
whether
you
were
wronged
or
not
alcibiades
to
be
sure
i
knew
i
was
quite
aware
that
i
was
being
cheated
socrates
then
you
suppose
yourself
even
when
a
child
to
have
known
the
nature
of
just
and
unjust
alcibiades
certainly
and
i
did
know
then
socrates
and
when
did
you
discover
them
not
surely
at
the
time
when
you
thought
that
you
knew
them
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
and
when
did
you
think
that
you
were
ignorant
if
you
consider
you
will
find
that
there
never
was
such
a
time
alcibiades
really
socrates
i
can
not
say
socrates
then
you
did
not
learn
them
by
discovering
them
alcibiades
clearly
not
socrates
but
just
before
you
said
that
you
did
not
know
them
by
learning
now
if
you
have
neither
discovered
nor
learned
them
how
and
whence
do
you
come
to
know
them
alcibiades
i
suppose
that
i
was
mistaken
in
saying
that
i
knew
them
through
my
own
discovery
of
them
whereas
in
truth
i
learned
them
in
the
same
way
that
other
people
learn
socrates
so
you
said
before
and
i
must
again
ask
of
whom
do
tell
me
alcibiades
of
the
many
socrates
do
you
take
refuge
in
them
i
can
not
say
much
for
your
teachers
alcibiades
why
are
they
not
able
to
teach
socrates
they
could
not
teach
you
how
to
play
at
draughts
which
you
would
acknowledge
would
you
not
to
be
a
much
smaller
matter
than
justice
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
can
they
teach
the
better
who
are
unable
to
teach
the
worse
alcibiades
i
think
that
they
can
at
any
rate
they
can
teach
many
far
better
things
than
to
play
at
draughts
socrates
what
things
alcibiades
why
for
example
i
learned
to
speak
greek
of
them
and
i
can
not
say
who
was
my
teacher
or
to
whom
i
am
to
attribute
my
knowledge
of
greek
if
not
to
those
teachers
as
you
call
them
socrates
why
yes
my
friend
and
the
many
are
good
enough
teachers
of
greek
and
some
of
their
instructions
in
that
line
may
be
justly
praised
alcibiades
why
is
that
socrates
why
because
they
have
the
qualities
which
good
teachers
ought
to
have
alcibiades
what
qualities
socrates
why
you
know
that
knowledge
is
the
first
qualification
of
any
teacher
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
if
they
know
they
must
agree
together
and
not
differ
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
would
you
say
that
they
knew
the
things
about
which
they
differ
alcibiades
no
socrates
then
how
can
they
teach
them
alcibiades
they
can
not
socrates
well
but
do
you
imagine
that
the
many
would
differ
about
the
nature
of
wood
and
stone
are
they
not
agreed
if
you
ask
them
what
they
are
and
do
they
not
run
to
fetch
the
same
thing
when
they
want
a
piece
of
wood
or
a
stone
and
so
in
similar
cases
which
i
suspect
to
be
pretty
nearly
all
that
you
mean
by
speaking
greek
alcibiades
true
socrates
these
as
we
were
saying
are
matters
about
which
they
are
agreed
with
one
another
and
with
themselves
both
individuals
and
states
use
the
same
words
about
them
they
do
not
use
some
one
word
and
some
another
alcibiades
they
do
not
socrates
then
they
may
be
expected
to
be
good
teachers
of
these
things
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
if
we
want
to
instruct
any
one
in
them
we
shall
be
right
in
sending
him
to
be
taught
by
our
friends
the
many
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
but
if
we
wanted
further
to
know
not
only
which
are
men
and
which
are
horses
but
which
men
or
horses
have
powers
of
running
would
the
many
still
be
able
to
inform
us
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
and
you
have
a
sufficient
proof
that
they
do
not
know
these
things
and
are
not
the
best
teachers
of
them
inasmuch
as
they
are
never
agreed
about
them
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
suppose
that
we
wanted
to
know
not
only
what
men
are
like
but
what
healthy
or
diseased
men
are
like
would
the
many
be
able
to
teach
us
alcibiades
they
would
not
socrates
and
you
would
have
a
proof
that
they
were
bad
teachers
of
these
matters
if
you
saw
them
at
variance
alcibiades
i
should
socrates
well
but
are
the
many
agreed
with
themselves
or
with
one
another
about
the
justice
or
injustice
of
men
and
things
alcibiades
assuredly
not
socrates
socrates
there
is
no
subject
about
which
they
are
more
at
variance
alcibiades
none
socrates
i
do
not
suppose
that
you
ever
saw
or
heard
of
men
quarrelling
over
the
principles
of
health
and
disease
to
such
an
extent
as
to
go
to
war
and
kill
one
another
for
the
sake
of
them
alcibiades
no
indeed
socrates
but
of
the
quarrels
about
justice
and
injustice
even
if
you
have
never
seen
them
you
have
certainly
heard
from
many
people
including
homer
for
you
have
heard
of
the
iliad
and
odyssey
alcibiades
to
be
sure
socrates
socrates
a
difference
of
just
and
unjust
is
the
argument
of
those
poems
alcibiades
true
socrates
which
difference
caused
all
the
wars
and
deaths
of
trojans
and
achaeans
and
the
deaths
of
the
suitors
of
penelope
in
their
quarrel
with
odysseus
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
and
when
the
athenians
and
lacedaemonians
and
boeotians
fell
at
tanagra
and
afterwards
in
the
battle
of
coronea
at
which
your
father
cleinias
met
his
end
the
question
was
one
of
justice
this
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
battles
and
of
their
deaths
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
but
can
they
be
said
to
understand
that
about
which
they
are
quarrelling
to
the
death
alcibiades
clearly
not
socrates
and
yet
those
whom
you
thus
allow
to
be
ignorant
are
the
teachers
to
whom
you
are
appealing
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
but
how
are
you
ever
likely
to
know
the
nature
of
justice
and
injustice
about
which
you
are
so
perplexed
if
you
have
neither
learned
them
of
others
nor
discovered
them
yourself
alcibiades
from
what
you
say
i
suppose
not
socrates
see
again
how
inaccurately
you
speak
alcibiades
alcibiades
in
what
respect
socrates
in
saying
that
i
say
so
alcibiades
why
did
you
not
say
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
just
and
unjust
socrates
no
i
did
not
alcibiades
did
i
then
socrates
yes
alcibiades
how
was
that
socrates
let
me
explain
suppose
i
were
to
ask
you
which
is
the
greater
number
two
or
one
you
would
reply
alcibiades
i
should
socrates
and
by
how
much
greater
alcibiades
by
one
socrates
which
of
us
now
says
that
two
is
more
than
one
alcibiades
i
do
socrates
did
not
i
ask
and
you
answer
the
question
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
who
is
speaking
i
who
put
the
question
or
you
who
answer
me
alcibiades
i
am
socrates
or
suppose
that
i
ask
and
you
tell
me
the
letters
which
make
up
the
name
socrates
which
of
us
is
the
speaker
alcibiades
i
am
socrates
now
let
us
put
the
case
generally
whenever
there
is
a
question
and
answer
who
is
the
speaker
the
questioner
or
the
answerer
alcibiades
i
should
say
socrates
that
the
answerer
was
the
speaker
socrates
and
have
i
not
been
the
questioner
all
through
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
you
the
answerer
alcibiades
just
so
socrates
which
of
us
then
was
the
speaker
alcibiades
the
inference
is
socrates
that
i
was
the
speaker
socrates
did
not
some
one
say
that
alcibiades
the
fair
son
of
cleinias
not
understanding
about
just
and
unjust
but
thinking
that
he
did
understand
was
going
to
the
assembly
to
advise
the
athenians
about
what
he
did
not
know
was
not
that
said
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
then
alcibiades
the
result
may
be
expressed
in
the
language
of
euripides
i
think
that
you
have
heard
all
this
yourself
and
not
from
me
nor
did
i
say
this
which
you
erroneously
attribute
to
me
but
you
yourself
and
what
you
said
was
very
true
for
indeed
my
dear
fellow
the
design
which
you
meditate
of
teaching
what
you
do
not
know
and
have
not
taken
any
pains
to
learn
is
downright
insanity
alcibiades
but
socrates
i
think
that
the
athenians
and
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
do
not
often
advise
as
to
the
more
just
or
unjust
for
they
see
no
difficulty
in
them
and
therefore
they
leave
them
and
consider
which
course
of
action
will
be
most
expedient
for
there
is
a
difference
between
justice
and
expediency
many
persons
have
done
great
wrong
and
profited
by
their
injustice
others
have
done
rightly
and
come
to
no
good
socrates
well
but
granting
that
the
just
and
the
expedient
are
ever
so
much
opposed
you
surely
do
not
imagine
that
you
know
what
is
expedient
for
mankind
or
why
a
thing
is
expedient
alcibiades
why
not
socrates
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
asked
again
from
whom
i
learned
or
when
i
made
the
discovery
socrates
what
a
way
you
have
when
you
make
a
mistake
which
might
be
refuted
by
a
previous
argument
you
insist
on
having
a
new
and
different
refutation
the
old
argument
is
a
garment
which
you
will
no
longer
put
on
but
some
one
must
produce
another
which
is
clean
and
new
now
i
shall
disregard
this
move
of
yours
and
shall
ask
over
again
where
did
you
learn
and
how
do
you
know
the
nature
of
the
expedient
and
who
is
your
teacher
all
this
i
comprehend
in
a
single
question
and
now
you
will
manifestly
be
in
the
old
difficulty
and
will
not
be
able
to
show
that
you
know
the
expedient
either
because
you
learned
or
because
you
discovered
it
yourself
but
as
i
perceive
that
you
are
dainty
and
dislike
the
taste
of
a
stale
argument
i
will
enquire
no
further
into
your
knowledge
of
what
is
expedient
or
what
is
not
expedient
for
the
athenian
people
and
simply
request
you
to
say
why
you
do
not
explain
whether
justice
and
expediency
are
the
same
or
different
and
if
you
like
you
may
examine
me
as
i
have
examined
you
or
if
you
would
rather
you
may
carry
on
the
discussion
by
yourself
alcibiades
but
i
am
not
certain
socrates
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
discuss
the
matter
with
you
socrates
then
imagine
my
dear
fellow
that
i
am
the
demus
and
the
ecclesia
for
in
the
ecclesia
too
you
will
have
to
persuade
men
individually
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
is
not
the
same
person
able
to
persuade
one
individual
singly
and
many
individuals
of
the
things
which
he
knows
the
grammarian
for
example
can
persuade
one
and
he
can
persuade
many
about
letters
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
about
number
will
not
the
same
person
persuade
one
and
persuade
many
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
this
will
be
he
who
knows
number
or
the
arithmetician
alcibiades
quite
true
socrates
and
can
not
you
persuade
one
man
about
that
of
which
you
can
persuade
many
alcibiades
i
suppose
so
socrates
and
that
of
which
you
can
persuade
either
is
clearly
what
you
know
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
the
only
difference
between
one
who
argues
as
we
are
doing
and
the
orator
who
is
addressing
an
assembly
is
that
the
one
seeks
to
persuade
a
number
and
the
other
an
individual
of
the
same
things
alcibiades
i
suppose
so
socrates
well
then
since
the
same
person
who
can
persuade
a
multitude
can
persuade
individuals
try
conclusions
upon
me
and
prove
to
me
that
the
just
is
not
always
expedient
alcibiades
you
take
liberties
socrates
socrates
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
proving
to
you
the
opposite
of
that
which
you
will
not
prove
to
me
alcibiades
proceed
socrates
answer
my
questions
that
is
all
alcibiades
nay
i
should
like
you
to
be
the
speaker
socrates
what
do
you
not
wish
to
be
persuaded
alcibiades
certainly
i
do
socrates
and
can
you
be
persuaded
better
than
out
of
your
own
mouth
alcibiades
i
think
not
socrates
then
you
shall
answer
and
if
you
do
not
hear
the
words
that
the
just
is
the
expedient
coming
from
your
own
lips
never
believe
another
man
again
alcibiades
i
wo
but
answer
i
will
for
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
come
to
any
harm
socrates
a
true
prophecy
let
me
begin
then
by
enquiring
of
you
whether
you
allow
that
the
just
is
sometimes
expedient
and
sometimes
not
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
sometimes
honourable
and
sometimes
not
alcibiades
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
am
asking
if
you
ever
knew
any
one
who
did
what
was
dishonourable
and
yet
just
alcibiades
never
socrates
all
just
things
are
honourable
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
are
honourable
things
sometimes
good
and
sometimes
not
good
or
are
they
always
good
alcibiades
i
rather
think
socrates
that
some
honourable
things
are
evil
socrates
and
are
some
dishonourable
things
good
alcibiades
yes
socrates
you
mean
in
such
a
case
as
the
following
in
time
of
war
men
have
been
wounded
or
have
died
in
rescuing
a
companion
or
kinsman
when
others
who
have
neglected
the
duty
of
rescuing
them
have
escaped
in
safety
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
to
rescue
another
under
such
circumstances
is
honourable
in
respect
of
the
attempt
to
save
those
whom
we
ought
to
save
and
this
is
courage
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
evil
in
respect
of
death
and
wounds
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
the
courage
which
is
shown
in
the
rescue
is
one
thing
and
the
death
another
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
then
the
rescue
of
one
friends
is
honourable
in
one
point
of
view
but
evil
in
another
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
if
honourable
then
also
good
will
you
consider
now
whether
i
may
not
be
right
for
you
were
acknowledging
that
the
courage
which
is
shown
in
the
rescue
is
honourable
now
is
this
courage
good
or
evil
look
at
the
matter
thus
which
would
you
rather
choose
good
or
evil
alcibiades
good
socrates
and
the
greatest
goods
you
would
be
most
ready
to
choose
and
would
least
like
to
be
deprived
of
them
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
what
would
you
say
of
courage
at
what
price
would
you
be
willing
to
be
deprived
of
courage
alcibiades
i
would
rather
die
than
be
a
coward
socrates
then
you
think
that
cowardice
is
the
worst
of
evils
alcibiades
i
do
socrates
as
bad
as
death
i
suppose
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
life
and
courage
are
the
extreme
opposites
of
death
and
cowardice
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
they
are
what
you
would
most
desire
to
have
and
their
opposites
you
would
least
desire
alcibiades
yes
socrates
is
this
because
you
think
life
and
courage
the
best
and
death
and
cowardice
the
worst
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
you
would
term
the
rescue
of
a
friend
in
battle
honourable
in
as
much
as
courage
does
a
good
work
alcibiades
i
should
socrates
but
evil
because
of
the
death
which
ensues
alcibiades
yes
socrates
might
we
not
describe
their
different
effects
as
follows
you
may
call
either
of
them
evil
in
respect
of
the
evil
which
is
the
result
and
good
in
respect
of
the
good
which
is
the
result
of
either
of
them
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
they
are
honourable
in
so
far
as
they
are
good
and
dishonourable
in
so
far
as
they
are
evil
alcibiades
true
socrates
then
when
you
say
that
the
rescue
of
a
friend
in
battle
is
honourable
and
yet
evil
that
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
rescue
is
good
and
yet
evil
alcibiades
i
believe
that
you
are
right
socrates
socrates
nothing
honourable
regarded
as
honourable
is
evil
nor
anything
base
regarded
as
base
good
alcibiades
clearly
not
socrates
look
at
the
matter
yet
once
more
in
a
further
light
he
who
acts
honourably
acts
well
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
he
who
acts
well
is
happy
alcibiades
of
course
socrates
and
the
happy
are
those
who
obtain
good
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
they
obtain
good
by
acting
well
and
honourably
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
acting
well
is
a
good
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
happiness
is
a
good
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
the
good
and
the
honourable
are
again
identified
alcibiades
manifestly
socrates
then
if
the
argument
holds
what
we
find
to
be
honourable
we
shall
also
find
to
be
good
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
is
the
good
expedient
or
not
alcibiades
expedient
socrates
do
you
remember
our
admissions
about
the
just
alcibiades
yes
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
said
that
those
who
acted
justly
must
also
act
honourably
socrates
and
the
honourable
is
the
good
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
the
good
is
expedient
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
alcibiades
the
just
is
expedient
alcibiades
i
should
infer
so
socrates
and
all
this
i
prove
out
of
your
own
mouth
for
i
ask
and
you
answer
alcibiades
i
must
acknowledge
it
to
be
true
socrates
and
having
acknowledged
that
the
just
is
the
same
as
the
expedient
are
you
not
let
me
ask
prepared
to
ridicule
any
one
who
pretending
to
understand
the
principles
of
justice
and
injustice
gets
up
to
advise
the
noble
athenians
or
the
ignoble
peparethians
that
the
just
may
be
the
evil
alcibiades
i
solemnly
declare
socrates
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
saying
verily
i
am
in
a
strange
state
for
when
you
put
questions
to
me
i
am
of
different
minds
in
successive
instants
socrates
and
are
you
not
aware
of
the
nature
of
this
perplexity
my
friend
alcibiades
indeed
i
am
not
socrates
do
you
suppose
that
if
some
one
were
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
two
eyes
or
three
or
two
hands
or
four
or
anything
of
that
sort
you
would
then
be
of
different
minds
in
successive
instants
alcibiades
i
begin
to
distrust
myself
but
still
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
should
socrates
you
would
feel
no
doubt
and
for
this
reason
because
you
would
know
alcibiades
i
suppose
so
socrates
and
the
reason
why
you
involuntarily
contradict
yourself
is
clearly
that
you
are
ignorant
alcibiades
very
likely
socrates
and
if
you
are
perplexed
in
answering
about
just
and
unjust
honourable
and
dishonourable
good
and
evil
expedient
and
inexpedient
the
reason
is
that
you
are
ignorant
of
them
and
therefore
in
perplexity
is
not
that
clear
alcibiades
i
agree
socrates
but
is
this
always
the
case
and
is
a
man
necessarily
perplexed
about
that
of
which
he
has
no
knowledge
alcibiades
certainly
he
is
socrates
and
do
you
know
how
to
ascend
into
heaven
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
and
in
this
case
too
is
your
judgment
perplexed
alcibiades
no
socrates
do
you
see
the
reason
why
or
shall
i
tell
you
alcibiades
tell
me
socrates
the
reason
is
that
you
not
only
do
not
know
my
friend
but
you
do
not
think
that
you
know
alcibiades
there
again
what
do
you
mean
socrates
ask
yourself
are
you
in
any
perplexity
about
things
of
which
you
are
ignorant
you
know
for
example
that
you
know
nothing
about
the
preparation
of
food
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
and
do
you
think
and
perplex
yourself
about
the
preparation
of
food
or
do
you
leave
that
to
some
one
who
understands
the
art
alcibiades
the
latter
socrates
or
if
you
were
on
a
voyage
would
you
bewilder
yourself
by
considering
whether
the
rudder
is
to
be
drawn
inwards
or
outwards
or
do
you
leave
that
to
the
pilot
and
do
nothing
alcibiades
it
would
be
the
concern
of
the
pilot
socrates
then
you
are
not
perplexed
about
what
you
do
not
know
if
you
know
that
you
do
not
know
it
alcibiades
i
imagine
not
socrates
do
you
not
see
then
that
mistakes
in
life
and
practice
are
likewise
to
be
attributed
to
the
ignorance
which
has
conceit
of
knowledge
alcibiades
once
more
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
suppose
that
we
begin
to
act
when
we
think
that
we
know
what
we
are
doing
alcibiades
yes
socrates
but
when
people
think
that
they
do
not
know
they
entrust
their
business
to
others
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
so
there
is
a
class
of
ignorant
persons
who
do
not
make
mistakes
in
life
because
they
trust
others
about
things
of
which
they
are
ignorant
alcibiades
true
socrates
who
then
are
the
persons
who
make
mistakes
they
can
not
of
course
be
those
who
know
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
but
if
neither
those
who
know
nor
those
who
know
that
they
do
not
know
make
mistakes
there
remain
those
only
who
do
not
know
and
think
that
they
know
alcibiades
yes
only
those
socrates
then
this
is
ignorance
of
the
disgraceful
sort
which
is
mischievous
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
most
mischievous
and
most
disgraceful
when
having
to
do
with
the
greatest
matters
alcibiades
by
far
socrates
and
can
there
be
any
matters
greater
than
the
just
the
honourable
the
good
and
the
expedient
alcibiades
there
can
not
be
socrates
and
these
as
you
were
saying
are
what
perplex
you
alcibiades
yes
socrates
but
if
you
are
perplexed
then
as
the
previous
argument
has
shown
you
are
not
only
ignorant
of
the
greatest
matters
but
being
ignorant
you
fancy
that
you
know
them
alcibiades
i
fear
that
you
are
right
socrates
and
now
see
what
has
happened
to
you
alcibiades
i
hardly
like
to
speak
of
your
evil
case
but
as
we
are
alone
i
will
my
good
friend
you
are
wedded
to
ignorance
of
the
most
disgraceful
kind
and
of
this
you
are
convicted
not
by
me
but
out
of
your
own
mouth
and
by
your
own
argument
wherefore
also
you
rush
into
politics
before
you
are
educated
neither
is
your
case
to
be
deemed
singular
for
i
might
say
the
same
of
almost
all
our
statesmen
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
your
guardian
pericles
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
pericles
is
said
not
to
have
got
his
wisdom
by
the
light
of
nature
but
to
have
associated
with
several
of
the
philosophers
with
pythocleides
for
example
and
with
anaxagoras
and
now
in
advanced
life
with
damon
in
the
hope
of
gaining
wisdom
socrates
very
good
but
did
you
ever
know
a
man
wise
in
anything
who
was
unable
to
impart
his
particular
wisdom
for
example
he
who
taught
you
letters
was
not
only
wise
but
he
made
you
and
any
others
whom
he
liked
wise
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
you
whom
he
taught
can
do
the
same
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
in
like
manner
the
harper
and
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
when
a
person
is
enabled
to
impart
knowledge
to
another
he
thereby
gives
an
excellent
proof
of
his
own
understanding
of
any
matter
alcibiades
i
agree
socrates
well
and
did
pericles
make
any
one
wise
did
he
begin
by
making
his
sons
wise
alcibiades
but
socrates
if
the
two
sons
of
pericles
were
simpletons
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
matter
socrates
well
but
did
he
make
your
brother
cleinias
wise
alcibiades
cleinias
is
a
madman
there
is
no
use
in
talking
of
him
socrates
but
if
cleinias
is
a
madman
and
the
two
sons
of
pericles
were
simpletons
what
reason
can
be
given
why
he
neglects
you
and
lets
you
be
as
you
are
alcibiades
i
believe
that
i
am
to
blame
for
not
listening
to
him
socrates
but
did
you
ever
hear
of
any
other
athenian
or
foreigner
bond
or
free
who
was
deemed
to
have
grown
wiser
in
the
society
of
pericles
as
i
might
cite
pythodorus
the
son
of
isolochus
and
callias
the
son
of
calliades
who
have
grown
wiser
in
the
society
of
zeno
for
which
privilege
they
have
each
of
them
paid
him
the
sum
of
a
hundred
minae
about
pounds
sterling
to
the
increase
of
their
wisdom
and
fame
alcibiades
i
certainly
never
did
hear
of
any
one
socrates
well
and
in
reference
to
your
own
case
do
you
mean
to
remain
as
you
are
or
will
you
take
some
pains
about
yourself
alcibiades
with
your
aid
socrates
i
will
and
indeed
when
i
hear
you
speak
the
truth
of
what
you
are
saying
strikes
home
to
me
and
i
agree
with
you
for
our
statesmen
all
but
a
few
do
appear
to
be
quite
uneducated
socrates
what
is
the
inference
alcibiades
why
that
if
they
were
educated
they
would
be
trained
athletes
and
he
who
means
to
rival
them
ought
to
have
knowledge
and
experience
when
he
attacks
them
but
now
as
they
have
become
politicians
without
any
special
training
why
should
i
have
the
trouble
of
learning
and
practising
for
i
know
well
that
by
the
light
of
nature
i
shall
get
the
better
of
them
socrates
my
dear
friend
what
a
sentiment
and
how
unworthy
of
your
noble
form
and
your
high
estate
alcibiades
what
do
you
mean
socrates
why
do
you
say
so
socrates
i
am
grieved
when
i
think
of
our
mutual
love
alcibiades
at
what
socrates
at
your
fancying
that
the
contest
on
which
you
are
entering
is
with
people
here
alcibiades
why
what
others
are
there
socrates
is
that
a
question
which
a
magnanimous
soul
should
ask
alcibiades
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
contest
is
not
with
these
socrates
and
suppose
that
you
were
going
to
steer
a
ship
into
action
would
you
only
aim
at
being
the
best
pilot
on
board
would
you
not
while
acknowledging
that
you
must
possess
this
degree
of
excellence
rather
look
to
your
antagonists
and
not
as
you
are
now
doing
to
your
fellow
combatants
you
ought
to
be
so
far
above
these
latter
that
they
will
not
even
dare
to
be
your
rivals
and
being
regarded
by
you
as
inferiors
will
do
battle
for
you
against
the
enemy
this
is
the
kind
of
superiority
which
you
must
establish
over
them
if
you
mean
to
accomplish
any
noble
action
really
worthy
of
yourself
and
of
the
state
alcibiades
that
would
certainly
be
my
aim
socrates
verily
then
you
have
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
if
you
are
better
than
the
soldiers
and
you
need
not
when
you
are
their
superior
and
have
your
thoughts
and
actions
fixed
upon
them
look
away
to
the
generals
of
the
enemy
alcibiades
of
whom
are
you
speaking
socrates
socrates
why
you
surely
know
that
our
city
goes
to
war
now
and
then
with
the
lacedaemonians
and
with
the
great
king
alcibiades
true
enough
socrates
and
if
you
meant
to
be
the
ruler
of
this
city
would
you
not
be
right
in
considering
that
the
lacedaemonian
and
persian
king
were
your
true
rivals
alcibiades
i
believe
that
you
are
right
socrates
oh
no
my
friend
i
am
quite
wrong
and
i
think
that
you
ought
rather
to
turn
your
attention
to
midias
the
and
others
like
him
who
manage
our
politics
in
whom
as
the
women
would
remark
you
may
still
see
the
slaves
cut
of
hair
cropping
out
in
their
minds
as
well
as
on
their
pates
and
they
come
with
their
barbarous
lingo
to
flatter
us
and
not
to
rule
us
to
these
i
say
you
should
look
and
then
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
about
your
own
fitness
to
contend
in
such
a
noble
arena
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
either
learn
what
has
to
be
learned
or
practise
what
has
to
be
practised
and
only
when
thoroughly
prepared
enter
on
a
political
career
alcibiades
there
i
think
socrates
that
you
are
right
i
do
not
suppose
however
that
the
spartan
generals
or
the
great
king
are
really
different
from
anybody
else
socrates
but
my
dear
friend
do
consider
what
you
are
saying
alcibiades
what
am
i
to
consider
socrates
in
the
first
place
will
you
be
more
likely
to
take
care
of
yourself
if
you
are
in
a
wholesome
fear
and
dread
of
them
or
if
you
are
not
alcibiades
clearly
if
i
have
such
a
fear
of
them
socrates
and
do
you
think
that
you
will
sustain
any
injury
if
you
take
care
of
yourself
alcibiades
no
i
shall
be
greatly
benefited
socrates
and
this
is
one
very
important
respect
in
which
that
notion
of
yours
is
bad
alcibiades
true
socrates
in
the
next
place
consider
that
what
you
say
is
probably
false
alcibiades
how
so
socrates
let
me
ask
you
whether
better
natures
are
likely
to
be
found
in
noble
races
or
not
in
noble
races
alcibiades
clearly
in
noble
races
socrates
are
not
those
who
are
well
born
and
well
bred
most
likely
to
be
perfect
in
virtue
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
then
let
us
compare
our
antecedents
with
those
of
the
lacedaemonian
and
persian
kings
are
they
inferior
to
us
in
descent
have
we
not
heard
that
the
former
are
sprung
from
heracles
and
the
latter
from
achaemenes
and
that
the
race
of
heracles
and
the
race
of
achaemenes
go
back
to
perseus
son
of
zeus
alcibiades
why
so
does
mine
go
back
to
eurysaces
and
he
to
zeus
socrates
and
mine
noble
alcibiades
to
daedalus
and
he
to
hephaestus
son
of
zeus
but
for
all
that
we
are
far
inferior
to
them
for
they
are
descended
zeus
through
a
line
of
kings
either
kings
of
argos
and
lacedaemon
or
kings
of
persia
a
country
which
the
descendants
of
achaemenes
have
always
possessed
besides
being
at
various
times
sovereigns
of
asia
as
they
now
are
whereas
we
and
our
fathers
were
but
private
persons
how
ridiculous
would
you
be
thought
if
you
were
to
make
a
display
of
your
ancestors
and
of
salamis
the
island
of
eurysaces
or
of
aegina
the
habitation
of
the
still
more
ancient
aeacus
before
artaxerxes
son
of
xerxes
you
should
consider
how
inferior
we
are
to
them
both
in
the
derivation
of
our
birth
and
in
other
particulars
did
you
never
observe
how
great
is
the
property
of
the
spartan
kings
and
their
wives
are
under
the
guardianship
of
the
ephori
who
are
public
officers
and
watch
over
them
in
order
to
preserve
as
far
as
possible
the
purity
of
the
heracleid
blood
still
greater
is
the
difference
among
the
persians
for
no
one
entertains
a
suspicion
that
the
father
of
a
prince
of
persia
can
be
any
one
but
the
king
such
is
the
awe
which
invests
the
person
of
the
queen
that
any
other
guard
is
needless
and
when
the
heir
of
the
kingdom
is
born
all
the
subjects
of
the
king
feast
and
the
day
of
his
birth
is
for
ever
afterwards
kept
as
a
holiday
and
time
of
sacrifice
by
all
asia
whereas
when
you
and
i
were
born
alcibiades
as
the
comic
poet
says
the
neighbours
hardly
knew
of
the
important
event
after
the
birth
of
the
royal
child
he
is
tended
not
by
a
but
by
the
best
of
the
royal
eunuchs
who
are
charged
with
the
care
of
him
and
especially
with
the
fashioning
and
right
formation
of
his
limbs
in
order
that
he
may
be
as
shapely
as
possible
which
being
their
calling
they
are
held
in
great
honour
and
when
the
young
prince
is
seven
years
old
he
is
put
upon
a
horse
and
taken
to
the
and
begins
to
go
out
hunting
and
at
fourteen
years
of
age
he
is
handed
over
to
the
royal
schoolmasters
as
they
are
termed
these
are
four
chosen
men
reputed
to
be
the
best
among
the
persians
of
a
certain
age
and
one
of
them
is
the
wisest
another
the
justest
a
third
the
most
temperate
and
a
fourth
the
most
valiant
the
first
instructs
him
in
the
magianism
of
zoroaster
the
son
of
oromasus
which
is
the
worship
of
the
gods
and
teaches
him
also
the
duties
of
his
royal
office
the
second
who
is
the
justest
teaches
him
always
to
speak
the
truth
the
third
or
most
temperate
forbids
him
to
allow
any
pleasure
to
be
lord
over
him
that
he
may
be
accustomed
to
be
a
freeman
and
king
indeed
lord
of
himself
first
and
not
a
slave
the
most
valiant
trains
him
to
be
bold
and
fearless
telling
him
that
if
he
fears
he
is
to
deem
himself
a
slave
whereas
pericles
gave
you
alcibiades
for
a
tutor
zopyrus
the
thracian
a
slave
of
his
who
was
past
all
other
work
i
might
enlarge
on
the
nurture
and
education
of
your
rivals
but
that
would
be
tedious
and
what
i
have
said
is
a
sufficient
sample
of
what
remains
to
be
said
i
have
only
to
remark
by
way
of
contrast
that
no
one
cares
about
your
birth
or
nurture
or
education
or
i
may
say
about
that
of
any
other
athenian
unless
he
has
a
lover
who
looks
after
him
and
if
you
cast
an
eye
on
the
wealth
the
luxury
the
garments
with
their
flowing
trains
the
anointings
with
myrrh
the
multitudes
of
attendants
and
all
the
other
bravery
of
the
persians
you
will
be
ashamed
when
you
discern
your
own
inferiority
or
if
you
look
at
the
temperance
and
orderliness
and
ease
and
grace
and
magnanimity
and
courage
and
endurance
and
love
of
toil
and
desire
of
glory
and
ambition
of
the
lacedaemonians
in
all
these
respects
you
will
see
that
you
are
but
a
child
in
comparison
of
them
even
in
the
matter
of
wealth
if
you
value
yourself
upon
that
i
must
reveal
to
you
how
you
stand
for
if
you
form
an
estimate
of
the
wealth
of
the
lacedaemonians
you
will
see
that
our
possessions
fall
far
short
of
theirs
for
no
one
here
can
compete
with
them
either
in
the
extent
and
fertility
of
their
own
and
the
messenian
territory
or
in
the
number
of
their
slaves
and
especially
of
the
helots
or
of
their
horses
or
of
the
animals
which
feed
on
the
messenian
pastures
but
i
have
said
enough
of
this
and
as
to
gold
and
silver
there
is
more
of
them
in
lacedaemon
than
in
all
the
rest
of
hellas
for
during
many
generations
gold
has
been
always
flowing
in
to
them
from
the
whole
hellenic
world
and
often
from
the
barbarian
also
and
never
going
out
as
in
the
fable
of
aesop
the
fox
said
to
the
lion
prints
of
the
feet
of
those
going
in
are
distinct
enough
but
who
ever
saw
the
trace
of
money
going
out
of
lacedaemon
and
therefore
you
may
safely
infer
that
the
inhabitants
are
the
richest
of
the
hellenes
in
gold
and
silver
and
that
their
kings
are
the
richest
of
them
for
they
have
a
larger
share
of
these
things
and
they
have
also
a
tribute
paid
to
them
which
is
very
considerable
yet
the
spartan
wealth
though
great
in
comparison
of
the
wealth
of
the
other
hellenes
is
as
nothing
in
comparison
of
that
of
the
persians
and
their
kings
why
i
have
been
informed
by
a
credible
person
who
went
up
to
the
king
at
susa
that
he
passed
through
a
large
tract
of
excellent
land
extending
for
nearly
a
day
journey
which
the
people
of
the
country
called
the
queen
girdle
and
another
which
they
called
her
veil
and
several
other
fair
and
fertile
districts
which
were
reserved
for
the
adornment
of
the
queen
and
are
named
after
her
several
habiliments
now
i
can
not
help
thinking
to
myself
what
if
some
one
were
to
go
to
amestris
the
wife
of
xerxes
and
mother
of
artaxerxes
and
say
to
her
there
is
a
certain
dinomache
whose
whole
wardrobe
is
not
worth
fifty
minae
and
that
will
be
more
than
the
value
and
she
has
a
son
who
is
possessed
of
a
acre
patch
at
erchiae
and
he
has
a
mind
to
go
to
war
with
your
son
would
she
not
wonder
to
what
this
alcibiades
trusts
for
success
in
the
conflict
must
rely
she
would
say
to
herself
his
training
and
wisdom
these
are
the
things
which
hellenes
value
and
if
she
heard
that
this
alcibiades
who
is
making
the
attempt
is
not
as
yet
twenty
years
old
and
is
wholly
uneducated
and
when
his
lover
tells
him
that
he
ought
to
get
education
and
training
first
and
then
go
and
fight
the
king
he
refuses
and
says
that
he
is
well
enough
as
he
is
would
she
not
be
amazed
and
ask
what
then
does
the
youth
rely
and
if
we
replied
he
relies
on
his
beauty
and
stature
and
birth
and
mental
endowments
she
would
think
that
we
were
mad
alcibiades
when
she
compared
the
advantages
which
you
possess
with
those
of
her
own
people
and
i
believe
that
even
lampido
the
daughter
of
leotychides
the
wife
of
archidamus
and
mother
of
agis
all
of
whom
were
kings
would
have
the
same
feeling
if
in
your
present
uneducated
state
you
were
to
turn
your
thoughts
against
her
son
she
too
would
be
equally
astonished
but
how
disgraceful
that
we
should
not
have
as
high
a
notion
of
what
is
required
in
us
as
our
wives
and
mothers
have
of
the
qualities
which
are
required
in
their
assailants
o
my
friend
be
persuaded
by
me
and
hear
the
delphian
inscription
thyself
not
the
men
whom
you
think
but
these
kings
are
our
rivals
and
we
can
only
overcome
them
by
pains
and
skill
and
if
you
fail
in
the
required
qualities
you
will
fail
also
in
becoming
renowned
among
hellenes
and
barbarians
which
you
seem
to
desire
more
than
any
other
man
ever
desired
anything
alcibiades
i
entirely
believe
you
but
what
are
the
sort
of
pains
which
are
required
socrates
can
you
tell
me
socrates
yes
i
can
but
we
must
take
counsel
together
concerning
the
manner
in
which
both
of
us
may
be
most
improved
for
what
i
am
telling
you
of
the
necessity
of
education
applies
to
myself
as
well
as
to
you
and
there
is
only
one
point
in
which
i
have
an
advantage
over
you
alcibiades
what
is
that
socrates
i
have
a
guardian
who
is
better
and
wiser
than
your
guardian
pericles
alcibiades
who
is
he
socrates
socrates
god
alcibiades
who
up
to
this
day
has
not
allowed
me
to
converse
with
you
and
he
inspires
in
me
the
faith
that
i
am
especially
designed
to
bring
you
to
honour
alcibiades
you
are
jesting
socrates
socrates
perhaps
at
any
rate
i
am
right
in
saying
that
all
men
greatly
need
pains
and
care
and
you
and
i
above
all
men
alcibiades
you
are
not
far
wrong
about
me
socrates
and
certainly
not
about
myself
alcibiades
but
what
can
we
do
socrates
there
must
be
no
hesitation
or
cowardice
my
friend
alcibiades
that
would
not
become
us
socrates
socrates
no
indeed
and
we
ought
to
take
counsel
together
for
do
we
not
wish
to
be
as
good
as
possible
alcibiades
we
do
socrates
in
what
sort
of
virtue
alcibiades
plainly
in
the
virtue
of
good
men
socrates
who
are
good
in
what
alcibiades
those
clearly
who
are
good
in
the
management
of
affairs
socrates
what
sort
of
affairs
equestrian
affairs
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
you
mean
that
about
them
we
should
have
recourse
to
horsemen
alcibiades
yes
socrates
well
naval
affairs
alcibiades
no
socrates
you
mean
that
we
should
have
recourse
to
sailors
about
them
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
what
affairs
and
who
do
them
alcibiades
the
affairs
which
occupy
athenian
gentlemen
socrates
and
when
you
speak
of
gentlemen
do
you
mean
the
wise
or
the
unwise
alcibiades
the
wise
socrates
and
a
man
is
good
in
respect
of
that
in
which
he
is
wise
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
evil
in
respect
of
that
in
which
he
is
unwise
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
the
shoemaker
for
example
is
wise
in
respect
of
the
making
of
shoes
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
he
is
good
in
that
alcibiades
he
is
socrates
but
in
respect
of
the
making
of
garments
he
is
unwise
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
in
that
he
is
bad
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
upon
this
view
of
the
matter
the
same
man
is
good
and
also
bad
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
would
you
say
that
the
good
are
the
same
as
the
bad
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
then
whom
do
you
call
the
good
alcibiades
i
mean
by
the
good
those
who
are
able
to
rule
in
the
city
socrates
not
surely
over
horses
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
but
over
men
alcibiades
yes
socrates
when
they
are
sick
alcibiades
no
socrates
or
on
a
voyage
alcibiades
no
socrates
or
reaping
the
harvest
alcibiades
no
socrates
when
they
are
doing
something
or
nothing
alcibiades
when
they
are
doing
something
i
should
say
socrates
i
wish
that
you
would
explain
to
me
what
this
something
is
alcibiades
when
they
are
having
dealings
with
one
another
and
using
one
another
services
as
we
citizens
do
in
our
daily
life
socrates
those
of
whom
you
speak
are
ruling
over
men
who
are
using
the
services
of
other
men
alcibiades
yes
socrates
are
they
ruling
over
the
who
give
the
time
to
the
rowers
alcibiades
no
they
are
not
socrates
that
would
be
the
office
of
the
pilot
alcibiades
yes
socrates
but
perhaps
you
mean
that
they
rule
over
who
lead
the
singers
and
use
the
services
of
the
dancers
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
that
would
be
the
business
of
the
teacher
of
the
chorus
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
what
is
the
meaning
of
being
able
to
rule
over
men
who
use
other
men
alcibiades
i
mean
that
they
rule
over
men
who
have
common
rights
of
citizenship
and
dealings
with
one
another
socrates
and
what
sort
of
an
art
is
this
suppose
that
i
ask
you
again
as
i
did
just
now
what
art
makes
men
know
how
to
rule
over
their
how
would
you
answer
alcibiades
the
art
of
the
pilot
socrates
and
if
i
may
recur
to
another
old
instance
what
art
enables
them
to
rule
over
their
alcibiades
the
art
of
the
teacher
of
the
chorus
which
you
were
just
now
mentioning
socrates
and
what
do
you
call
the
art
of
alcibiades
i
should
say
good
counsel
socrates
socrates
and
is
the
art
of
the
pilot
evil
counsel
alcibiades
no
socrates
but
good
counsel
alcibiades
yes
that
is
what
i
should
say
good
counsel
of
which
the
aim
is
the
preservation
of
the
voyagers
socrates
true
and
what
is
the
aim
of
that
other
good
counsel
of
which
you
speak
alcibiades
the
aim
is
the
better
order
and
preservation
of
the
city
socrates
and
what
is
that
of
which
the
absence
or
presence
improves
and
preserves
the
order
of
the
city
suppose
you
were
to
ask
me
what
is
that
of
which
the
presence
or
absence
improves
or
preserves
the
order
of
the
body
i
should
reply
the
presence
of
health
and
the
absence
of
disease
you
would
say
the
same
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
if
you
were
to
ask
me
the
same
question
about
the
eyes
i
should
reply
in
the
same
way
presence
of
sight
and
the
absence
of
blindness
or
about
the
ears
i
should
reply
that
they
were
improved
and
were
in
better
case
when
deafness
was
absent
and
hearing
was
present
in
them
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
what
would
you
say
of
a
state
what
is
that
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
which
the
state
is
improved
and
better
managed
and
ordered
alcibiades
i
should
say
socrates
the
presence
of
friendship
and
the
absence
of
hatred
and
division
socrates
and
do
you
mean
by
friendship
agreement
or
disagreement
alcibiades
agreement
socrates
what
art
makes
cities
agree
about
numbers
alcibiades
arithmetic
socrates
and
private
individuals
alcibiades
the
same
socrates
and
what
art
makes
each
individual
agree
with
himself
alcibiades
the
same
socrates
and
what
art
makes
each
of
us
agree
with
himself
about
the
comparative
length
of
the
span
and
of
the
cubit
does
not
the
art
of
measure
alcibiades
yes
socrates
individuals
are
agreed
with
one
another
about
this
and
states
equally
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
the
same
holds
of
the
balance
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
what
is
the
other
agreement
of
which
you
speak
and
about
what
what
art
can
give
that
agreement
and
does
that
which
gives
it
to
the
state
give
it
also
to
the
individual
so
as
to
make
him
consistent
with
himself
and
with
another
alcibiades
i
should
suppose
so
socrates
but
what
is
the
nature
of
the
agreement
answer
and
faint
not
alcibiades
i
mean
to
say
that
there
should
be
such
friendship
and
agreement
as
exists
between
an
affectionate
father
and
mother
and
their
son
or
between
brothers
or
between
husband
and
wife
socrates
but
can
a
man
alcibiades
agree
with
a
woman
about
the
spinning
of
wool
which
she
understands
and
he
does
not
alcibiades
no
truly
socrates
nor
has
he
any
need
for
spinning
is
a
female
accomplishment
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
would
a
woman
agree
with
a
man
about
the
science
of
arms
which
she
has
never
learned
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
i
suppose
that
the
use
of
arms
would
be
regarded
by
you
as
a
male
accomplishment
alcibiades
it
would
socrates
then
upon
your
view
women
and
men
have
two
sorts
of
knowledge
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
then
in
their
knowledge
there
is
no
agreement
of
women
and
men
alcibiades
there
is
not
socrates
nor
can
there
be
friendship
if
friendship
is
agreement
alcibiades
plainly
not
socrates
then
women
are
not
loved
by
men
when
they
do
their
own
work
alcibiades
i
suppose
not
socrates
nor
men
by
women
when
they
do
their
own
work
alcibiades
no
socrates
nor
are
states
well
administered
when
individuals
do
their
own
work
alcibiades
i
should
rather
think
socrates
that
the
reverse
is
the
truth
compare
republic
socrates
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
states
are
well
administered
when
friendship
is
absent
the
presence
of
which
as
we
were
saying
alone
secures
their
good
order
alcibiades
but
i
should
say
that
there
is
friendship
among
them
for
this
very
reason
that
the
two
parties
respectively
do
their
own
work
socrates
that
was
not
what
you
were
saying
before
and
what
do
you
mean
now
by
affirming
that
friendship
exists
when
there
is
no
agreement
how
can
there
be
agreement
about
matters
which
the
one
party
knows
and
of
which
the
other
is
in
ignorance
alcibiades
impossible
socrates
and
when
individuals
are
doing
their
own
work
are
they
doing
what
is
just
or
unjust
alcibiades
what
is
just
certainly
socrates
and
when
individuals
do
what
is
just
in
the
state
is
there
no
friendship
among
them
alcibiades
i
suppose
that
there
must
be
socrates
socrates
then
what
do
you
mean
by
this
friendship
or
agreement
about
which
we
must
be
wise
and
discreet
in
order
that
we
may
be
good
men
i
can
not
make
out
where
it
exists
or
among
whom
according
to
you
the
same
persons
may
sometimes
have
it
and
sometimes
not
alcibiades
but
indeed
socrates
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
saying
and
i
have
long
been
unconsciously
to
myself
in
a
most
disgraceful
state
socrates
nevertheless
cheer
up
at
fifty
if
you
had
discovered
your
deficiency
you
would
have
been
too
old
and
the
time
for
taking
care
of
yourself
would
have
passed
away
but
yours
is
just
the
age
at
which
the
discovery
should
be
made
alcibiades
and
what
should
he
do
socrates
who
would
make
the
discovery
socrates
answer
questions
alcibiades
and
that
is
a
process
which
by
the
grace
of
god
if
i
may
put
any
faith
in
my
oracle
will
be
very
improving
to
both
of
us
alcibiades
if
i
can
be
improved
by
answering
i
will
answer
socrates
and
first
of
all
that
we
may
not
peradventure
be
deceived
by
appearances
fancying
perhaps
that
we
are
taking
care
of
ourselves
when
we
are
not
what
is
the
meaning
of
a
man
taking
care
of
himself
and
when
does
he
take
care
does
he
take
care
of
himself
when
he
takes
care
of
what
belongs
to
him
alcibiades
i
should
think
so
socrates
when
does
a
man
take
care
of
his
feet
does
he
not
take
care
of
them
when
he
takes
care
of
that
which
belongs
to
his
feet
alcibiades
i
do
not
understand
socrates
let
me
take
the
hand
as
an
illustration
does
not
a
ring
belong
to
the
finger
and
to
the
finger
only
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
the
shoe
in
like
manner
to
the
foot
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
when
we
take
care
of
our
shoes
do
we
not
take
care
of
our
feet
alcibiades
i
do
not
comprehend
socrates
socrates
but
you
would
admit
alcibiades
that
to
take
proper
care
of
a
thing
is
a
correct
expression
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
taking
proper
care
means
improving
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
what
is
the
art
which
improves
our
shoes
alcibiades
shoemaking
socrates
then
by
shoemaking
we
take
care
of
our
shoes
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
do
we
by
shoemaking
take
care
of
our
feet
or
by
some
other
art
which
improves
the
feet
alcibiades
by
some
other
art
socrates
and
the
same
art
improves
the
feet
which
improves
the
rest
of
the
body
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
which
is
gymnastic
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
then
by
gymnastic
we
take
care
of
our
feet
and
by
shoemaking
of
that
which
belongs
to
our
feet
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
and
by
gymnastic
we
take
care
of
our
hands
and
by
the
art
of
graving
rings
of
that
which
belongs
to
our
hands
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
by
gymnastic
we
take
care
of
the
body
and
by
the
art
of
weaving
and
the
other
arts
we
take
care
of
the
things
of
the
body
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
then
the
art
which
takes
care
of
each
thing
is
different
from
that
which
takes
care
of
the
belongings
of
each
thing
alcibiades
true
socrates
then
in
taking
care
of
what
belongs
to
you
you
do
not
take
care
of
yourself
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
for
the
art
which
takes
care
of
our
belongings
appears
not
to
be
the
same
as
that
which
takes
care
of
ourselves
alcibiades
clearly
not
socrates
and
now
let
me
ask
you
what
is
the
art
with
which
we
take
care
of
ourselves
alcibiades
i
can
not
say
socrates
at
any
rate
thus
much
has
been
admitted
that
the
art
is
not
one
which
makes
any
of
our
possessions
but
which
makes
ourselves
better
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
should
we
ever
have
known
what
art
makes
a
shoe
better
if
we
did
not
know
a
shoe
alcibiades
impossible
socrates
nor
should
we
know
what
art
makes
a
ring
better
if
we
did
not
know
a
ring
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
and
can
we
ever
know
what
art
makes
a
man
better
if
we
do
not
know
what
we
are
ourselves
alcibiades
impossible
socrates
and
is
such
an
easy
thing
and
was
he
to
be
lightly
esteemed
who
inscribed
the
text
on
the
temple
at
delphi
or
is
a
difficult
thing
which
few
are
able
to
attain
alcibiades
at
times
i
fancy
socrates
that
anybody
can
know
himself
at
other
times
the
task
appears
to
be
very
difficult
socrates
but
whether
easy
or
difficult
alcibiades
still
there
is
no
other
way
knowing
what
we
are
we
shall
know
how
to
take
care
of
ourselves
and
if
we
are
ignorant
we
shall
not
know
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
well
then
let
us
see
in
what
way
the
can
be
discovered
by
us
that
will
give
us
a
chance
of
discovering
our
own
existence
which
otherwise
we
can
never
know
alcibiades
you
say
truly
socrates
come
now
i
beseech
you
tell
me
with
whom
you
are
conversing
with
whom
but
with
me
alcibiades
yes
socrates
as
i
am
with
you
alcibiades
yes
socrates
that
is
to
say
i
socrates
am
talking
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
alcibiades
is
my
hearer
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
i
in
talking
use
words
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
talking
and
using
words
have
i
suppose
the
same
meaning
alcibiades
to
be
sure
socrates
and
the
user
is
not
the
same
as
the
thing
which
he
uses
alcibiades
what
do
you
mean
socrates
i
will
explain
the
shoemaker
for
example
uses
a
square
tool
and
a
circular
tool
and
other
tools
for
cutting
alcibiades
yes
socrates
but
the
tool
is
not
the
same
as
the
cutter
and
user
of
the
tool
alcibiades
of
course
not
socrates
and
in
the
same
way
the
instrument
of
the
harper
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
harper
himself
alcibiades
it
is
socrates
now
the
question
which
i
asked
was
whether
you
conceive
the
user
to
be
always
different
from
that
which
he
uses
alcibiades
i
do
socrates
then
what
shall
we
say
of
the
shoemaker
does
he
cut
with
his
tools
only
or
with
his
hands
alcibiades
with
his
hands
as
well
socrates
he
uses
his
hands
too
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
does
he
use
his
eyes
in
cutting
leather
alcibiades
he
does
socrates
and
we
admit
that
the
user
is
not
the
same
with
the
things
which
he
uses
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
the
shoemaker
and
the
harper
are
to
be
distinguished
from
the
hands
and
feet
which
they
use
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
and
does
not
a
man
use
the
whole
body
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
and
that
which
uses
is
different
from
that
which
is
used
alcibiades
true
socrates
then
a
man
is
not
the
same
as
his
own
body
alcibiades
that
is
the
inference
socrates
what
is
he
then
alcibiades
i
can
not
say
socrates
nay
you
can
say
that
he
is
the
user
of
the
body
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
the
user
of
the
body
is
the
soul
alcibiades
yes
the
soul
socrates
and
the
soul
rules
alcibiades
yes
socrates
let
me
make
an
assertion
which
will
i
think
be
universally
admitted
alcibiades
what
is
it
socrates
that
man
is
one
of
three
things
alcibiades
what
are
they
socrates
soul
body
or
both
together
forming
a
whole
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
but
did
we
not
say
that
the
actual
ruling
principle
of
the
body
is
man
alcibiades
yes
we
did
socrates
and
does
the
body
rule
over
itself
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
it
is
subject
as
we
were
saying
alcibiades
yes
socrates
then
that
is
not
the
principle
which
we
are
seeking
alcibiades
it
would
seem
not
socrates
but
may
we
say
that
the
union
of
the
two
rules
over
the
body
and
consequently
that
this
is
man
alcibiades
very
likely
socrates
the
most
unlikely
of
all
things
for
if
one
of
the
members
is
subject
the
two
united
can
not
possibly
rule
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
since
neither
the
body
nor
the
union
of
the
two
is
man
either
man
has
no
real
existence
or
the
soul
is
man
alcibiades
just
so
socrates
is
anything
more
required
to
prove
that
the
soul
is
man
alcibiades
certainly
not
the
proof
is
i
think
quite
sufficient
socrates
and
if
the
proof
although
not
perfect
be
sufficient
we
shall
be
satisfied
more
precise
proof
will
be
supplied
when
we
have
discovered
that
which
we
were
led
to
omit
from
a
fear
that
the
enquiry
would
be
too
much
protracted
alcibiades
what
was
that
socrates
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
absolute
existence
must
be
first
considered
but
now
instead
of
absolute
existence
we
have
been
considering
the
nature
of
individual
existence
and
this
may
perhaps
be
sufficient
for
surely
there
is
nothing
which
may
be
called
more
properly
ourselves
than
the
soul
alcibiades
there
is
nothing
socrates
then
we
may
truly
conceive
that
you
and
i
are
conversing
with
one
another
soul
to
soul
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
and
that
is
just
what
i
was
saying
before
that
i
socrates
am
not
arguing
or
talking
with
the
face
of
alcibiades
but
with
the
real
alcibiades
or
in
other
words
with
his
soul
alcibiades
true
socrates
then
he
who
bids
a
man
know
himself
would
have
him
know
his
soul
alcibiades
that
appears
to
be
true
socrates
he
whose
knowledge
only
extends
to
the
body
knows
the
things
of
a
man
and
not
the
man
himself
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
then
neither
the
physician
regarded
as
a
physician
nor
the
trainer
regarded
as
a
trainer
knows
himself
alcibiades
he
does
not
socrates
the
husbandmen
and
the
other
craftsmen
are
very
far
from
knowing
themselves
for
they
would
seem
not
even
to
know
their
own
belongings
when
regarded
in
relation
to
the
arts
which
they
practise
they
are
even
further
removed
from
for
they
only
know
the
belongings
of
the
body
which
minister
to
the
body
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
then
if
temperance
is
the
knowledge
of
self
in
respect
of
his
art
none
of
them
is
temperate
alcibiades
i
agree
socrates
and
this
is
the
reason
why
their
arts
are
accounted
vulgar
and
are
not
such
as
a
good
man
would
practise
alcibiades
quite
true
socrates
again
he
who
cherishes
his
body
cherishes
not
himself
but
what
belongs
to
him
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
but
he
who
cherishes
his
money
cherishes
neither
himself
nor
his
belongings
but
is
in
a
stage
yet
further
removed
from
himself
alcibiades
i
agree
socrates
then
the
has
really
ceased
to
be
occupied
with
his
own
concerns
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
if
any
one
has
fallen
in
love
with
the
person
of
alcibiades
he
loves
not
alcibiades
but
the
belongings
of
alcibiades
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
he
who
loves
your
soul
is
the
true
lover
alcibiades
that
is
the
necessary
inference
socrates
the
lover
of
the
body
goes
away
when
the
flower
of
youth
fades
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
he
who
loves
the
soul
goes
not
away
as
long
as
the
soul
follows
after
virtue
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
i
am
the
lover
who
goes
not
away
but
remains
with
you
when
you
are
no
longer
young
and
the
rest
are
gone
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
therein
you
do
well
and
i
hope
that
you
will
remain
socrates
then
you
must
try
to
look
your
best
alcibiades
i
will
socrates
the
fact
is
that
there
is
only
one
lover
of
alcibiades
the
son
of
cleinias
there
neither
is
nor
ever
has
been
seemingly
any
other
and
he
is
his
darling
socrates
the
son
of
sophroniscus
and
phaenarete
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
did
you
not
say
that
if
i
had
not
spoken
first
you
were
on
the
point
of
coming
to
me
and
enquiring
why
i
only
remained
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
the
reason
was
that
i
loved
you
for
your
own
sake
whereas
other
men
love
what
belongs
to
you
and
your
beauty
which
is
not
you
is
fading
away
just
as
your
true
self
is
beginning
to
bloom
and
i
will
never
desert
you
if
you
are
not
spoiled
and
deformed
by
the
athenian
people
for
the
danger
which
i
most
fear
is
that
you
will
become
a
lover
of
the
people
and
will
be
spoiled
by
them
many
a
noble
athenian
has
been
ruined
in
this
way
for
the
demus
of
the
erechteus
is
of
a
fair
countenance
but
you
should
see
him
naked
wherefore
observe
the
caution
which
i
give
you
alcibiades
what
caution
socrates
practise
yourself
sweet
friend
in
learning
what
you
ought
to
know
before
you
enter
on
politics
and
then
you
will
have
an
antidote
which
will
keep
you
out
of
harm
way
alcibiades
good
advice
socrates
but
i
wish
that
you
would
explain
to
me
in
what
way
i
am
to
take
care
of
myself
socrates
have
we
not
made
an
advance
for
we
are
at
any
rate
tolerably
well
agreed
as
to
what
we
are
and
there
is
no
longer
any
danger
as
we
once
feared
that
we
might
be
taking
care
not
of
ourselves
but
of
something
which
is
not
ourselves
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
and
the
next
step
will
be
to
take
care
of
the
soul
and
look
to
that
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
leaving
the
care
of
our
bodies
and
of
our
properties
to
others
alcibiades
very
good
socrates
but
how
can
we
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
things
of
the
soul
for
if
we
know
them
then
i
suppose
we
shall
know
ourselves
can
we
really
be
ignorant
of
the
excellent
meaning
of
the
delphian
inscription
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
alcibiades
what
have
you
in
your
thoughts
socrates
socrates
i
will
tell
you
what
i
suspect
to
be
the
meaning
and
lesson
of
that
inscription
let
me
take
an
illustration
from
sight
which
i
imagine
to
be
the
only
one
suitable
to
my
purpose
alcibiades
what
do
you
mean
socrates
consider
if
some
one
were
to
say
to
the
eye
thyself
as
you
might
say
to
a
man
thyself
what
is
the
nature
and
meaning
of
this
precept
would
not
his
meaning
be
that
the
eye
should
look
at
that
in
which
it
would
see
itself
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
and
what
are
the
objects
in
looking
at
which
we
see
ourselves
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
in
looking
at
mirrors
and
the
like
socrates
very
true
and
is
there
not
something
of
the
nature
of
a
mirror
in
our
own
eyes
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
did
you
ever
observe
that
the
face
of
the
person
looking
into
the
eye
of
another
is
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
and
in
the
visual
organ
which
is
over
against
him
and
which
is
called
the
pupil
there
is
a
sort
of
image
of
the
person
looking
alcibiades
that
is
quite
true
socrates
then
the
eye
looking
at
another
eye
and
at
that
in
the
eye
which
is
most
perfect
and
which
is
the
instrument
of
vision
will
there
see
itself
alcibiades
that
is
evident
socrates
but
looking
at
anything
else
either
in
man
or
in
the
world
and
not
to
what
resembles
this
it
will
not
see
itself
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
then
if
the
eye
is
to
see
itself
it
must
look
at
the
eye
and
at
that
part
of
the
eye
where
sight
which
is
the
virtue
of
the
eye
resides
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
if
the
soul
my
dear
alcibiades
is
ever
to
know
herself
must
she
not
look
at
the
soul
and
especially
at
that
part
of
the
soul
in
which
her
virtue
resides
and
to
any
other
which
is
like
this
alcibiades
i
agree
socrates
socrates
and
do
we
know
of
any
part
of
our
souls
more
divine
than
that
which
has
to
do
with
wisdom
and
knowledge
alcibiades
there
is
none
socrates
then
this
is
that
part
of
the
soul
which
resembles
the
divine
and
he
who
looks
at
this
and
at
the
whole
class
of
things
divine
will
be
most
likely
to
know
himself
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
and
we
agree
to
be
wisdom
alcibiades
true
socrates
but
if
we
have
no
and
no
wisdom
can
we
ever
know
our
own
good
and
evil
alcibiades
how
can
we
socrates
socrates
you
mean
that
if
you
did
not
know
alcibiades
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
your
knowing
that
what
belonged
to
alcibiades
was
really
his
alcibiades
it
would
be
quite
impossible
socrates
nor
should
we
know
that
we
were
the
persons
to
whom
anything
belonged
if
we
did
not
know
ourselves
alcibiades
how
could
we
socrates
and
if
we
did
not
know
our
own
belongings
neither
should
we
know
the
belongings
of
our
belongings
alcibiades
clearly
not
socrates
then
we
were
not
altogether
right
in
acknowledging
just
now
that
a
man
may
know
what
belongs
to
him
and
yet
not
know
himself
nay
rather
he
can
not
even
know
the
belongings
of
his
belongings
for
the
discernment
of
the
things
of
self
and
of
the
things
which
belong
to
the
things
of
self
appear
all
to
be
the
business
of
the
same
man
and
of
the
same
art
alcibiades
so
much
may
be
supposed
socrates
and
he
who
knows
not
the
things
which
belong
to
himself
will
in
like
manner
be
ignorant
of
the
things
which
belong
to
others
alcibiades
very
true
socrates
and
if
he
knows
not
the
affairs
of
others
he
will
not
know
the
affairs
of
states
alcibiades
certainly
not
socrates
then
such
a
man
can
never
be
a
statesman
alcibiades
he
can
not
socrates
nor
an
economist
alcibiades
he
can
not
socrates
he
will
not
know
what
he
is
doing
alcibiades
he
will
not
socrates
and
will
not
he
who
is
ignorant
fall
into
error
alcibiades
assuredly
socrates
and
if
he
falls
into
error
will
he
not
fail
both
in
his
public
and
private
capacity
alcibiades
yes
indeed
socrates
and
failing
will
he
not
be
miserable
alcibiades
very
socrates
and
what
will
become
of
those
for
whom
he
is
acting
alcibiades
they
will
be
miserable
also
socrates
then
he
who
is
not
wise
and
good
can
not
be
happy
alcibiades
he
can
not
socrates
the
bad
then
are
miserable
alcibiades
yes
very
socrates
and
if
so
not
he
who
has
riches
but
he
who
has
wisdom
is
delivered
from
his
misery
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
cities
then
if
they
are
to
be
happy
do
not
want
walls
or
triremes
or
docks
or
numbers
or
size
alcibiades
without
virtue
compare
arist
pol
alcibiades
indeed
they
do
not
socrates
and
you
must
give
the
citizens
virtue
if
you
mean
to
administer
their
affairs
rightly
or
nobly
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
but
can
a
man
give
that
which
he
has
not
alcibiades
impossible
socrates
then
you
or
any
one
who
means
to
govern
and
superintend
not
only
himself
and
the
things
of
himself
but
the
state
and
the
things
of
the
state
must
in
the
first
place
acquire
virtue
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
you
have
not
therefore
to
obtain
power
or
authority
in
order
to
enable
you
to
do
what
you
wish
for
yourself
and
the
state
but
justice
and
wisdom
alcibiades
clearly
socrates
you
and
the
state
if
you
act
wisely
and
justly
will
act
according
to
the
will
of
god
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
as
i
was
saying
before
you
will
look
only
at
what
is
bright
and
divine
and
act
with
a
view
to
them
alcibiades
yes
socrates
in
that
mirror
you
will
see
and
know
yourselves
and
your
own
good
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
so
you
will
act
rightly
and
well
alcibiades
yes
socrates
in
which
case
i
will
be
security
for
your
happiness
alcibiades
i
accept
the
security
socrates
but
if
you
act
unrighteously
your
eye
will
turn
to
the
dark
and
godless
and
being
in
darkness
and
ignorance
of
yourselves
you
will
probably
do
deeds
of
darkness
alcibiades
very
possibly
socrates
for
if
a
man
my
dear
alcibiades
has
the
power
to
do
what
he
likes
but
has
no
understanding
what
is
likely
to
be
the
result
either
to
him
as
an
individual
or
to
the
state
for
example
if
he
be
sick
and
is
able
to
do
what
he
likes
not
having
the
mind
of
a
physician
having
moreover
tyrannical
power
and
no
one
daring
to
reprove
him
what
will
happen
to
him
will
he
not
be
likely
to
have
his
constitution
ruined
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
or
again
in
a
ship
if
a
man
having
the
power
to
do
what
he
likes
has
no
intelligence
or
skill
in
navigation
do
you
see
what
will
happen
to
him
and
to
his
alcibiades
yes
i
see
that
they
will
all
perish
socrates
and
in
like
manner
in
a
state
and
where
there
is
any
power
and
authority
which
is
wanting
in
virtue
will
not
misfortune
in
like
manner
ensue
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
not
tyrannical
power
then
my
good
alcibiades
should
be
the
aim
either
of
individuals
or
states
if
they
would
be
happy
but
virtue
alcibiades
that
is
true
socrates
and
before
they
have
virtue
to
be
commanded
by
a
superior
is
better
for
men
as
well
as
for
children
compare
arist
pol
alcibiades
that
is
evident
socrates
and
that
which
is
better
is
also
nobler
alcibiades
true
socrates
and
what
is
nobler
is
more
becoming
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
then
to
the
bad
man
slavery
is
more
becoming
because
better
alcibiades
true
socrates
then
vice
is
only
suited
to
a
slave
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
virtue
to
a
freeman
alcibiades
yes
socrates
and
o
my
friend
is
not
the
condition
of
a
slave
to
be
avoided
alcibiades
certainly
socrates
socrates
and
are
you
now
conscious
of
your
own
state
and
do
you
know
whether
you
are
a
freeman
or
not
alcibiades
i
think
that
i
am
very
conscious
indeed
of
my
own
state
socrates
and
do
you
know
how
to
escape
out
of
a
state
which
i
do
not
even
like
to
name
to
my
beauty
alcibiades
yes
i
do
socrates
how
alcibiades
by
your
help
socrates
socrates
that
is
not
well
said
alcibiades
alcibiades
what
ought
i
to
have
said
socrates
by
the
help
of
god
alcibiades
i
agree
and
i
further
say
that
our
relations
are
likely
to
be
reversed
from
this
day
forward
i
must
and
will
follow
you
as
you
have
followed
me
i
will
be
the
disciple
and
you
shall
be
my
master
socrates
o
that
is
rare
my
love
breeds
another
love
and
so
like
the
stork
i
shall
be
cherished
by
the
bird
whom
i
have
hatched
alcibiades
strange
but
true
and
henceforward
i
shall
begin
to
think
about
justice
socrates
and
i
hope
that
you
will
persist
although
i
have
fears
not
because
i
doubt
you
but
i
see
the
power
of
the
state
which
may
be
too
much
for
both
of
us
