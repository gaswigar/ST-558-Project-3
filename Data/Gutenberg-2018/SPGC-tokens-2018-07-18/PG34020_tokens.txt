i
sentiment
and
clues
in
my
criminal
work
anything
that
wears
skirts
is
a
lady
until
the
law
proves
her
otherwise
from
the
frayed
and
slovenly
petticoats
of
the
woman
who
owns
a
poultry
stand
in
the
market
and
who
has
grown
wealthy
by
selling
chickens
at
twelve
ounces
to
the
pound
or
the
silk
sweep
of
mamie
tracy
whose
diamonds
have
been
stolen
down
on
the
avenue
or
the
staidly
respectable
black
and
skirt
of
the
client
whose
husband
has
found
an
affinity
partial
to
laces
and
fripperies
and
has
run
off
with
her
all
the
wearers
are
ladies
and
as
such
announced
by
hawes
in
fact
he
carries
it
to
excess
he
speaks
of
his
wash
lady
with
a
husband
who
is
an
ash
merchant
and
he
announced
one
day
in
some
excitement
that
the
lady
who
had
just
gone
out
had
appropriated
all
the
loose
change
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
so
when
hawes
announced
a
lady
i
took
my
feet
off
my
desk
put
down
the
brief
i
had
been
reading
and
rose
perfunctorily
with
my
first
glance
at
my
visitor
however
i
threw
away
my
cigar
and
i
have
heard
since
settled
my
tie
that
this
client
was
different
was
borne
in
on
me
at
once
by
the
way
she
entered
the
room
she
had
poise
in
spite
of
embarrassment
and
her
face
when
she
raised
her
veil
was
white
refined
and
young
i
did
not
send
in
my
name
she
said
when
she
saw
me
glancing
down
for
the
card
hawes
usually
puts
on
my
table
it
was
advice
i
wanted
and
i
i
did
not
think
the
name
would
matter
she
was
more
composed
i
think
when
she
found
me
considerably
older
than
herself
i
saw
her
looking
furtively
at
the
graying
places
over
my
ears
i
am
only
as
far
as
that
goes
but
my
family
although
it
keeps
its
hair
turns
gray
early
a
business
asset
but
a
social
handicap
wo
you
sit
down
i
asked
pushing
out
a
chair
so
that
she
would
face
the
light
while
i
remained
in
shadow
every
doctor
and
every
lawyer
knows
that
trick
as
far
as
the
name
goes
perhaps
you
would
better
tell
me
the
trouble
first
then
if
i
think
it
indispensable
you
can
tell
me
she
acquiesced
to
this
and
sat
for
a
moment
silent
her
gaze
absently
on
the
windows
of
the
building
across
in
the
morning
light
my
first
impression
was
verified
only
too
often
the
raising
of
a
woman
veil
in
my
office
reveals
the
ravages
of
tears
or
rouge
or
dissipation
my
new
client
turned
fearlessly
to
the
window
an
unlined
face
with
a
clear
skin
healthily
pale
from
where
i
sat
her
profile
was
beautiful
in
spite
of
its
drooping
suggestion
of
trouble
her
first
embarrassment
gone
she
had
forgotten
herself
and
was
intent
on
her
errand
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
she
said
but
suppose
slowly
suppose
that
a
man
a
man
should
leave
home
without
warning
not
taking
any
clothes
except
those
he
wore
and
saying
he
was
coming
home
to
dinner
and
he
he
she
stopped
as
if
her
voice
had
failed
her
and
he
does
not
come
i
prompted
she
nodded
fumbling
for
her
handkerchief
in
her
bag
how
long
has
he
been
gone
i
asked
i
had
heard
exactly
the
same
thing
before
but
to
leave
a
woman
like
that
hardly
more
than
a
girl
and
lovely
ten
days
i
should
think
it
ought
to
be
looked
into
i
said
decisively
and
got
up
somehow
i
could
sit
quietly
a
lawyer
who
is
worth
anything
is
always
a
partisan
i
suppose
and
i
never
hear
of
a
man
deserting
his
wife
that
i
am
not
indignant
the
virtuous
scorn
of
the
unmarried
man
perhaps
but
you
will
have
to
tell
me
more
than
that
did
this
gentleman
have
any
bad
habits
that
is
did
he
er
drink
not
to
excess
he
had
been
forbidden
anything
of
that
sort
by
his
physician
he
played
bridge
for
money
but
i
believe
he
was
rather
lucky
she
colored
uncomfortably
married
i
suppose
i
asked
casually
he
had
been
his
wife
died
when
i
she
stopped
and
bit
her
lip
then
it
was
not
her
husband
after
all
oddly
enough
the
sun
came
out
just
at
that
moment
spilling
a
pool
of
sunlight
at
her
feet
on
the
dusty
rug
with
its
scars
it
is
my
father
she
said
simply
i
was
absurdly
relieved
but
with
the
realization
that
i
had
not
a
case
of
desertion
on
my
hands
i
had
to
view
the
situation
from
a
new
angle
you
are
absolutely
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
disappearance
absolutely
you
have
had
no
word
from
him
none
he
never
went
away
before
for
any
length
of
time
without
telling
you
no
never
he
was
away
a
great
deal
but
i
always
knew
where
to
find
him
her
voice
broke
again
and
her
chin
quivered
i
thought
it
wise
to
reassure
her
do
let
us
worry
about
this
until
we
are
sure
it
is
serious
i
said
sometimes
the
things
that
seem
most
mysterious
have
the
simplest
explanations
he
may
have
written
and
the
letter
have
miscarried
or
even
a
slight
accident
would
account
i
saw
i
was
blundering
she
grew
white
and
but
of
course
that
unlikely
too
he
would
have
papers
to
identify
him
his
pockets
were
always
full
of
envelopes
and
things
like
that
she
assented
eagerly
do
you
think
i
ought
to
know
his
name
i
asked
it
need
not
be
known
outside
of
the
office
and
this
is
a
sort
of
confessional
anyhow
or
worse
people
tell
things
to
their
lawyer
that
they
would
think
of
telling
the
priest
her
color
was
slowly
coming
back
and
she
smiled
my
name
is
fleming
margery
fleming
she
said
after
a
hesitation
and
my
father
allan
fleming
is
the
man
oh
knox
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
has
been
gone
for
more
than
a
week
no
wonder
she
had
wished
to
conceal
the
identity
of
the
missing
man
so
allan
fleming
was
lost
a
good
many
highly
respectable
citizens
would
hope
that
he
might
never
be
found
fleming
state
treasurer
delightful
companion
polished
gentleman
and
successful
politician
of
the
criminal
type
outside
in
the
corridor
the
office
boy
was
singing
under
his
breath
oh
once
there
was
a
miller
he
sang
who
lived
in
a
mill
it
brought
back
to
my
mind
instantly
the
reform
meeting
at
the
city
hall
a
year
before
where
for
a
few
hours
we
had
blown
the
feeble
spark
of
protest
against
machine
domination
to
a
flame
we
had
sung
a
song
to
that
very
tune
and
with
this
girl
across
from
me
its
words
came
back
with
revolting
truth
it
had
been
printed
and
circulated
through
the
hall
oh
once
there
was
a
capitol
that
sat
on
a
hill
as
it
too
big
to
steal
away
it
probably
there
still
the
ring
hand
in
the
treasury
and
fleming
with
a
sack
they
take
it
out
in
wagon
loads
and
never
bring
it
back
i
put
the
song
out
of
my
mind
with
a
shudder
i
am
more
than
sorry
i
said
i
was
too
whatever
he
may
have
been
he
was
father
and
of
course
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
this
ought
not
to
be
known
for
a
time
at
least
after
all
as
i
say
there
may
be
a
dozen
simple
explanations
and
there
are
exigencies
in
politics
i
hate
politics
she
broke
in
suddenly
the
very
name
makes
me
ill
when
i
read
of
women
wanting
to
to
vote
and
all
that
i
wonder
if
they
know
what
it
means
to
have
to
be
polite
to
dreadful
people
people
who
have
even
been
convicts
and
all
that
why
our
last
butler
had
been
a
prize
fighter
she
sat
upright
with
her
hands
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
that
another
thing
too
knox
the
day
after
father
went
away
carter
left
and
he
has
not
come
back
carter
was
the
butler
yes
a
white
man
oh
yes
and
he
left
without
giving
you
any
warning
yes
he
served
luncheon
the
day
after
father
went
away
and
the
maids
say
he
went
away
immediately
after
he
was
not
there
that
evening
to
serve
dinner
but
he
came
back
late
that
night
and
got
into
the
house
using
his
key
to
the
servants
entrance
he
slept
there
the
maids
said
but
he
was
gone
before
the
servants
were
up
and
we
have
not
seen
him
since
i
made
a
mental
note
of
the
butler
we
go
back
to
carter
again
i
said
your
father
has
not
been
ill
has
he
i
mean
recently
she
considered
i
can
not
think
of
anything
except
that
he
had
a
tooth
pulled
she
was
quick
to
resent
my
smile
oh
i
know
i
not
helping
you
she
exclaimed
but
i
have
thought
over
everything
until
i
can
not
think
any
more
i
always
end
where
i
begin
you
have
not
noticed
any
mental
symptoms
any
lack
of
memory
her
eyes
filled
he
forgot
my
birthday
two
weeks
ago
she
said
it
was
the
first
one
he
had
ever
forgotten
in
nineteen
of
them
nineteen
nineteen
from
leaves
sixteen
what
i
meant
was
this
i
explained
people
sometimes
have
sudden
and
unaccountable
lapses
of
memory
and
at
those
times
they
are
apt
to
stray
away
from
home
has
your
father
been
worried
lately
he
has
not
been
himself
at
all
he
has
been
irritable
even
to
me
and
terrible
to
the
servants
only
to
carter
he
was
never
ugly
to
carter
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
lapse
of
memory
when
i
remember
how
he
looked
that
morning
i
believe
that
he
meant
then
to
go
away
it
shows
how
he
had
changed
when
he
could
think
of
going
away
without
a
word
and
leaving
me
there
alone
then
you
have
no
brothers
or
sisters
none
i
came
to
you
there
she
stopped
please
tell
me
how
you
happened
to
come
to
me
i
urged
i
think
you
know
that
i
am
both
honored
and
pleased
i
did
know
where
to
go
she
confessed
so
i
took
the
telephone
directory
the
classified
part
under
and
after
i
shut
my
eyes
i
put
my
finger
haphazard
on
the
page
it
pointed
to
your
name
i
am
afraid
i
flushed
at
this
but
it
was
a
wholesome
douche
in
a
moment
i
laughed
we
will
take
it
as
an
omen
i
said
and
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
but
i
am
not
a
detective
miss
fleming
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
one
not
the
police
she
shuddered
i
thought
you
could
do
something
without
calling
in
a
detective
suppose
you
tell
me
what
happened
the
day
your
father
left
and
how
he
went
away
tell
me
the
little
things
too
they
may
be
straws
that
will
point
in
a
certain
direction
in
the
first
place
she
began
we
live
on
monmouth
avenue
there
are
just
the
two
of
us
and
the
servants
a
cook
two
housemaids
a
laundress
a
butler
and
a
chauffeur
my
father
spends
much
of
his
time
at
the
capital
and
in
the
last
two
years
since
my
old
governess
went
back
to
germany
at
those
times
i
usually
go
to
mother
sisters
at
bellwood
miss
letitia
and
miss
jane
maitland
i
nodded
i
knew
the
maitland
ladies
well
i
had
drawn
four
different
wills
for
miss
letitia
in
the
last
year
my
father
went
away
on
the
tenth
of
may
you
say
to
tell
you
all
about
his
going
but
there
is
nothing
to
tell
we
have
a
machine
but
it
was
being
repaired
father
got
up
from
breakfast
picked
up
his
hat
and
walked
out
of
the
house
he
was
irritated
at
a
letter
he
had
read
at
the
table
could
you
find
that
letter
i
asked
quickly
he
took
it
with
him
i
knew
he
was
disturbed
for
he
did
not
even
say
he
was
going
he
took
a
car
and
i
thought
he
was
on
his
way
to
his
office
he
did
not
come
home
that
night
and
i
went
to
the
office
the
next
morning
the
stenographer
said
he
had
not
been
there
he
is
not
at
plattsburg
because
they
have
been
trying
to
call
him
from
there
on
the
long
distance
telephone
every
day
in
spite
of
her
candid
face
i
was
sure
she
was
holding
something
back
why
do
you
tell
me
everything
i
asked
you
may
be
keeping
back
the
one
essential
point
she
flushed
then
she
opened
her
and
gave
me
a
slip
of
rough
paper
on
it
in
careless
figures
was
the
number
eleven
that
was
all
i
was
afraid
you
would
think
it
silly
she
said
it
was
such
a
meaningless
thing
you
see
the
second
night
after
father
left
i
was
nervous
and
could
not
sleep
i
expected
him
home
at
any
time
and
i
kept
listening
for
his
step
about
three
i
was
sure
i
heard
some
one
in
the
room
below
mine
there
was
a
creaking
as
if
the
person
were
walking
carefully
i
felt
relieved
for
i
thought
he
had
come
back
but
i
did
not
hear
the
door
into
his
bedroom
close
and
i
got
more
and
more
wakeful
finally
i
got
up
and
slipped
along
the
hall
to
his
room
the
door
was
open
a
few
inches
and
i
reached
in
and
switched
on
the
electric
lights
i
had
a
queer
feeling
before
i
turned
on
the
light
that
there
was
some
one
standing
close
to
me
but
the
room
was
empty
and
the
hall
too
and
the
paper
when
i
saw
the
room
was
empty
i
went
in
the
paper
had
been
pinned
to
a
pillow
on
the
bed
at
first
i
thought
it
had
been
dropped
or
had
blown
there
when
i
saw
the
pin
i
was
startled
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
rang
for
annie
the
second
housemaid
who
is
also
a
sort
of
personal
maid
of
mine
it
was
three
when
annie
came
down
i
took
her
into
father
room
and
showed
her
the
paper
she
was
sure
it
was
not
there
when
she
folded
back
the
bed
clothes
for
the
night
at
nine
eleven
i
repeated
twice
eleven
is
but
that
is
very
enlightening
no
she
admitted
i
thought
it
might
be
a
telephone
number
and
i
called
up
all
the
eleven
in
the
city
in
spite
of
myself
i
laughed
and
after
a
moment
she
smiled
in
sympathy
we
are
not
brilliant
certainly
i
said
at
last
in
the
first
place
miss
fleming
if
i
thought
the
thing
was
very
serious
i
would
not
laugh
but
no
doubt
a
day
or
two
will
see
everything
straight
but
to
go
back
to
this
eleven
did
you
rouse
the
servants
and
have
the
house
searched
yes
annie
said
carter
had
come
back
and
she
went
to
waken
him
but
although
his
door
was
locked
inside
he
did
not
answer
annie
and
i
switched
on
all
the
lights
on
the
lower
floor
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
then
we
went
down
together
and
looked
around
every
window
and
door
was
locked
but
in
father
study
on
the
first
floor
two
drawers
of
his
desk
were
standing
open
and
in
the
library
the
little
compartment
in
my
where
i
keep
my
house
money
had
been
broken
open
and
the
money
taken
nothing
else
was
gone
nothing
the
silver
on
the
sideboard
in
the
plenty
of
valuable
things
in
the
cabinet
in
the
nothing
was
disturbed
it
might
have
been
carter
i
reflected
did
he
know
where
you
kept
your
house
money
it
is
possible
but
i
hardly
think
so
besides
if
he
was
going
to
steal
there
were
so
many
more
valuable
things
in
the
house
my
jewels
as
well
as
my
own
were
in
my
and
the
door
was
not
locked
they
were
not
disturbed
she
hesitated
they
had
been
disturbed
she
admitted
my
grandmother
left
each
of
her
children
some
unstrung
pearls
they
were
a
hobby
with
her
aunt
jane
and
aunt
letitia
never
had
theirs
strung
but
my
mother
were
made
into
different
things
all
i
left
them
locked
in
a
drawer
in
my
where
i
have
always
kept
them
the
following
morning
the
drawer
was
unlocked
and
partly
open
but
nothing
was
missing
all
your
jewelry
was
there
all
but
one
ring
which
i
rarely
remove
from
my
finger
i
followed
her
eyes
under
her
glove
was
the
outline
of
a
ring
a
solitaire
stone
nineteen
from
i
shook
myself
together
and
got
up
it
does
not
sound
like
an
ordinary
burglary
i
reflected
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
no
imagination
no
doubt
what
you
have
told
me
would
be
meat
and
drink
to
a
person
with
an
analytical
turn
of
mind
i
deduct
nineteen
from
leaves
sixteen
according
to
my
mental
process
although
i
know
men
who
could
make
the
difference
nothing
i
believe
she
thought
i
was
a
little
mad
for
her
face
took
on
again
its
despairing
look
we
find
him
knox
she
insisted
as
she
got
up
if
you
know
of
a
detective
that
you
can
trust
please
get
him
but
you
can
understand
that
the
unexplained
absence
of
the
state
treasurer
must
be
kept
secret
one
thing
i
am
sure
of
he
is
being
kept
away
you
know
what
enemies
he
has
men
like
schwartz
who
have
no
scruples
no
principle
schwartz
i
repeated
in
surprise
henry
schwartz
was
the
boss
of
his
party
in
the
state
the
man
of
whom
one
of
his
adversaries
had
said
with
the
distinct
approval
of
the
voting
public
that
he
was
so
low
in
the
scale
of
humanity
that
it
would
require
a
special
dispensation
of
heaven
to
raise
him
to
the
level
of
total
degradation
but
he
and
fleming
were
generally
supposed
to
be
captain
and
first
mate
of
the
pirate
craft
that
passed
with
us
for
the
ship
of
state
schwartz
and
my
father
are
allies
politically
the
girl
explained
with
heightened
color
but
they
are
not
friends
my
father
is
a
gentleman
the
inference
i
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
and
as
if
she
feared
she
had
said
too
much
the
girl
rose
when
she
left
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
with
the
promise
that
she
would
close
the
monmouth
avenue
house
and
go
to
her
aunts
at
bellwood
at
once
for
myself
i
pledged
a
thorough
search
for
her
father
and
began
it
by
watching
the
scarlet
wing
on
her
hat
through
the
top
of
the
elevator
cage
until
it
had
descended
out
of
sight
i
am
afraid
it
was
a
queer
hodgepodge
of
clues
and
sentiment
that
i
poured
out
to
hunter
the
detective
when
he
came
up
late
that
afternoon
hunter
was
quiet
when
i
finished
my
story
they
rotten
clear
through
he
reflected
this
administration
is
worse
than
the
last
and
it
was
a
peach
there
have
been
more
suicides
than
i
could
count
on
my
two
hands
in
the
last
ten
years
i
warn
you
you
be
better
out
of
this
mess
what
do
you
think
about
the
eleven
i
asked
as
he
got
up
and
buttoned
his
coat
well
it
might
mean
almost
anything
it
might
be
that
many
dollars
or
the
time
a
train
starts
or
it
might
be
the
eleventh
and
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
k
k
v
i
repeated
why
that
would
be
the
latin
beware
hunter
smiled
cheerfully
you
better
stick
to
the
law
knox
he
said
from
the
door
we
do
use
latin
in
the
detective
business

uneasy
apprehensions
plattsburg
was
not
the
name
of
the
capital
but
it
will
do
for
this
story
the
state
does
matter
either
you
may
take
your
choice
like
the
story
mark
twain
wrote
with
all
kinds
of
weather
at
the
beginning
so
the
reader
could
take
his
pick
we
will
say
that
my
home
city
is
manchester
i
live
with
my
married
brother
his
wife
and
two
boys
fred
is
older
than
i
am
and
he
is
an
exceptional
brother
on
the
day
he
came
home
from
his
wedding
trip
i
went
down
with
my
traps
on
a
hansom
in
accordance
with
a
prearranged
schedule
fred
and
edith
met
me
inside
the
door
here
your
jack
fred
said
as
he
shook
hands
only
one
stipulation
remember
we
are
strangers
in
the
vicinity
and
try
to
get
home
before
the
neighbors
are
up
we
have
our
reputations
to
think
of
there
is
no
hour
for
breakfast
edith
said
as
she
kissed
me
you
have
a
bath
of
your
own
and
do
smoke
in
the
fred
was
always
a
lucky
devil
i
had
been
there
now
for
six
years
i
had
helped
to
raise
two
young
knoxes
bully
youngsters
too
the
oldest
one
could
use
when
he
was
four
and
the
finest
collie
pup
in
our
end
of
the
state
i
wanted
to
raise
other
things
the
boys
liked
pets
but
edith
was
like
all
women
she
did
care
for
animals
i
had
a
built
and
stocked
in
the
laundry
and
a
on
the
roof
i
used
the
general
bath
and
gave
up
my
tub
to
a
young
alligator
i
got
in
florida
and
every
sunday
the
youngsters
and
i
had
a
great
time
trying
to
teach
it
to
do
tricks
i
have
always
taken
it
a
little
hard
that
edith
took
advantage
of
my
getting
the
measles
from
billy
to
clear
out
every
animal
in
the
house
she
broke
the
news
to
me
gently
the
day
the
rash
began
to
fade
maintaining
that
having
lost
one
cook
through
the
alligator
escaping
from
his
tub
and
being
mistaken
in
the
gloom
of
the
for
a
rubber
boot
and
picked
up
under
the
same
misapprehension
she
could
not
risk
another
cook
on
the
day
that
margery
fleming
came
to
me
about
her
father
i
went
home
in
a
state
of
mixed
emotion
dinner
was
not
a
quiet
meal
fred
and
i
talked
politics
generally
and
as
fred
was
on
one
side
and
i
on
the
other
there
was
always
an
argument
on
what
about
fleming
i
asked
at
last
when
fred
had
declared
that
in
these
days
of
corruption
no
matter
what
the
government
was
he
was
forninst
it
has
he
been
frightened
into
reform
bad
egg
he
said
jabbing
his
potato
as
if
it
had
been
a
politician
and
there
no
way
to
improve
a
bad
egg
except
to
hold
your
nose
that
what
the
public
is
doing
holding
its
nose
has
he
a
daughter
i
asked
casually
yes
a
lovely
girl
too
edith
assented
it
is
his
only
redeeming
quality
fleming
is
a
rascal
daughter
or
no
daughter
fred
persisted
ever
since
he
and
his
gang
got
poor
butler
into
trouble
and
then
left
him
to
kill
himself
as
the
only
way
out
i
have
felt
that
there
was
something
coming
to
all
of
them
hansen
schwartz
and
the
rest
i
saw
fleming
on
the
street
what
i
exclaimed
almost
jumping
out
of
my
chair
fred
surveyed
me
quizzically
over
his
coffee
cup
he
a
daughter
he
quoted
yes
i
saw
him
jack
this
very
day
in
an
unromantic
and
he
was
swearing
at
a
policeman
where
was
it
chestnut
and
union
his
cab
had
been
struck
by
a
car
and
badly
damaged
but
the
gentleman
refused
to
get
out
no
doubt
you
could
get
the
details
from
the
look
here
fred
i
said
earnestly
keep
that
to
yourself
will
you
and
you
too
edith
it
a
queer
story
and
i
tell
you
sometime
as
we
left
the
edith
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
do
get
mixed
up
with
those
people
jack
she
advised
margery
a
dear
girl
but
her
father
practically
killed
henry
butler
and
henry
butler
married
my
cousin
you
need
make
it
a
family
affair
i
protested
i
have
only
seen
the
girl
once
but
edith
smiled
i
know
what
i
know
she
said
how
extravagant
of
you
to
send
bobby
that
enormous
the
boy
has
to
learn
to
ride
sometime
in
four
years
he
can
have
a
pony
and
i
going
to
see
that
he
has
it
he
be
eight
by
that
time
edith
laughed
in
four
years
she
said
why
in
four
years
you
then
she
stopped
i
what
i
demanded
blocking
the
door
to
the
library
you
be
forty
jack
and
it
a
mighty
unattractive
man
who
gets
past
forty
without
being
sought
and
won
by
some
woman
you
be
buying
i
will
be
i
said
with
dignity
and
as
far
as
being
sought
and
won
goes
i
am
so
overwhelmed
by
fred
misery
that
i
intend
to
marry
at
all
if
i
do
i
it
will
be
to
some
girl
who
turns
and
runs
the
other
way
every
time
she
sees
me
the
oldest
trick
in
the
box
edith
scoffed
what
that
thing
always
quoting
woman
is
like
a
shadow
follow
her
she
flies
fly
from
her
she
follows
upon
my
word
i
said
indignantly
and
you
are
a
woman
i
different
she
retorted
i
only
a
wife
and
mother
in
the
library
fred
got
up
from
his
desk
and
gathered
up
his
papers
i
ca
think
with
you
two
whispering
there
he
said
i
going
to
the
den
as
he
slammed
the
door
into
his
workroom
edith
picked
up
her
skirts
and
scuttled
after
him
how
dare
you
run
away
like
that
she
called
you
promised
me
the
door
closed
behind
her
i
went
over
and
spoke
through
the
panels
her
she
flies
fly
from
her
she
follows
oh
wife
and
mother
i
called
for
heaven
sake
edith
fred
voice
rose
irritably
if
you
and
jack
are
going
to
talk
all
evening
go
and
sit
on
knee
and
let
me
alone
the
way
you
two
flirt
under
my
nose
is
a
scandal
do
you
hear
that
jack
good
night
edith
i
called
i
have
left
you
a
kiss
on
the
upper
left
hand
panel
of
the
door
and
i
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question
what
if
i
fly
from
the
woman
and
she
does
follow
thank
your
lucky
stars
fred
called
in
a
muffled
voice
and
i
left
them
to
themselves
i
had
some
work
to
do
at
the
office
work
that
the
interview
with
hunter
had
interrupted
and
half
past
eight
that
night
found
me
at
my
desk
but
my
mind
strayed
from
the
papers
before
me
after
a
useless
effort
to
concentrate
i
gave
it
up
as
useless
and
by
ten
i
was
on
the
street
again
my
evening
wasted
the
papers
in
the
libel
case
of
the
against
the
untouched
on
my
desk
and
i
the
victim
of
an
uneasy
apprehension
that
took
me
almost
without
volition
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
fleming
house
on
monmouth
avenue
for
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
miss
fleming
might
not
have
left
the
house
that
day
as
she
had
promised
might
still
be
there
liable
to
another
intrusion
by
the
mysterious
individual
who
had
a
key
to
the
house
it
was
a
relief
consequently
when
i
reached
its
corner
to
find
no
lights
in
the
building
the
girl
had
kept
her
word
assured
of
that
i
looked
at
the
house
curiously
it
was
one
of
the
largest
in
the
city
not
wide
but
running
far
back
along
the
side
street
a
small
yard
with
a
low
iron
fence
and
a
garage
completed
the
property
the
street
lights
left
the
back
of
the
house
in
shadow
and
as
i
stopped
in
the
shelter
of
the
garage
i
was
positive
that
i
heard
some
one
working
with
a
rear
window
of
the
empty
house
a
moment
later
the
sounds
ceased
and
muffled
footsteps
came
down
the
cement
walk
the
intruder
made
no
attempt
to
open
the
iron
gate
against
the
light
i
saw
him
put
a
leg
over
the
low
fence
follow
it
up
with
the
other
and
start
up
the
street
still
with
peculiar
noiselessness
of
stride
he
was
a
short
fellow
in
a
cap
and
his
silhouette
showed
a
prodigious
length
of
arm
i
followed
i
do
mind
saying
in
some
excitement
i
had
a
vision
of
grabbing
him
from
behind
and
leading
him
or
pushing
him
under
the
circumstances
in
triumph
to
the
police
station
and
another
mental
picture
not
so
pleasant
of
being
found
on
the
pavement
by
some
with
a
small
punctuation
mark
ending
my
sentence
of
life
but
i
was
not
apprehensive
i
even
remember
wondering
humorously
if
i
should
overtake
him
and
press
the
cold
end
of
my
silver
mounted
fountain
pen
into
the
nape
of
his
neck
if
he
would
throw
up
his
hands
and
surrender
i
had
read
somewhere
of
a
burglar
held
up
in
a
similar
way
with
a
our
pace
was
easy
once
the
man
just
ahead
stopped
and
lighted
a
cigarette
and
the
odor
of
a
very
fair
turkish
tobacco
came
back
to
me
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
at
me
and
went
on
without
quickening
his
pace
we
met
no
policemen
and
after
perhaps
five
minutes
walking
when
the
strain
was
growing
tense
my
gentleman
of
the
shoes
swung
abruptly
to
the
left
and
entered
the
police
station
i
had
occasion
to
see
davidson
many
times
after
that
during
the
strange
development
of
the
fleming
case
i
had
the
peculiar
experience
later
of
having
him
follow
me
as
i
had
trailed
him
that
night
and
i
had
occasion
once
to
test
the
strength
of
his
long
arms
when
he
helped
to
thrust
me
through
the
transom
at
the
white
cat
but
i
never
met
him
without
a
recurrence
of
the
sheepish
feeling
with
which
i
watched
him
swagger
up
to
the
night
sergeant
and
fall
into
easy
conversation
with
the
man
behind
the
desk
standing
in
the
glare
from
the
open
window
i
had
much
the
lost
pride
and
self
contempt
of
a
wet
cat
sitting
in
the
sun
two
or
three
roundsmen
were
sitting
against
the
wall
lazily
helmets
off
and
coats
open
against
the
warmth
of
the
early
spring
night
in
a
back
room
others
were
playing
checkers
and
disputing
noisily
voice
came
distinctly
through
the
open
windows
the
house
is
closed
he
reported
but
one
of
the
basement
windows
is
shuttered
and
the
lock
is
bad
i
could
find
shields
better
keep
an
eye
on
it
he
stopped
and
fished
in
his
pockets
with
a
grin
this
was
tied
to
the
knob
of
the
kitchen
door
he
said
raising
his
voice
for
the
benefit
of
the
room
and
holding
aloft
a
piece
of
paper
for
shields
he
explained
and
signed
the
men
gathered
around
him
even
the
sergeant
got
up
and
leaned
forward
his
elbows
on
his
desk
read
it
he
said
lazily
shields
has
got
a
wife
and
her
name
delia
dear
tom
davidson
read
in
a
mincing
falsetto
we
are
closing
up
unexpected
so
i
wo
be
here
i
am
going
to
mamie
and
if
you
want
to
talk
to
me
you
can
get
me
by
calling
up
the
clerk
is
a
gentleman
friend
of
mine
carter
the
butler
told
me
before
he
left
he
would
get
me
a
place
as
parlor
maid
so
i
have
another
situation
soon
delia
the
sergeant
scowled
i
goin
to
talk
to
tom
he
said
reaching
out
for
the
note
he
got
a
nice
family
and
things
like
that
bad
for
the
force
i
lighted
the
cigar
which
had
been
my
excuse
for
loitering
on
the
pavement
and
went
on
it
sounded
involved
for
a
novice
but
if
i
could
find
anderson
i
could
find
mamie
brennan
through
mamie
brennan
i
would
get
delia
and
through
delia
i
might
find
carter
i
was
vague
from
that
point
but
what
miss
fleming
had
said
of
carter
had
made
me
suspicious
of
him
under
an
arc
light
i
made
the
first
note
in
my
new
business
of
and
it
was
something
like
this

it
was

when
i
reached
the

of

and

streets
where
fred
had

allan
fleming
had
come
to
grief
in
a
cab
but
the
had
gone
and
the
night
man
on
the
beat
knew
nothing
of
course
of
any
particular
collision
there
plinty
of
every
day
at
this
corner
he
said
cheerfully

i
left
him
looking
reminiscently
at
the
pole
and
went
home
to
bed
i
had
made
no
headway
i
had
lost
conceit
with
myself
and
a
day
and
evening
at
the
office
and
i
had
gained
the
certainty
that
margery
fleming
was
safe
in
bellwood
and
the
uncertain
address
of
a
servant
who
know
something
about
fleming
i
was
still
awake
at
one
and
i
got
up
impatiently
and
consulted
the
telephone
directory
there
were
twelve
andersons
in
the
city
who
conducted
when
i
finally
went
to
sleep
i
dreamed
that
i
was
driving
margery
fleming
along
a
street
in
a
broken
taxicab
and
that
all
the
buildings
were
pharmacies
and
numbered
eleven

pearls
after
such
a
night
i
slept
late
edith
still
kept
her
honeymoon
promise
of
no
breakfast
hour
and
she
had
gone
out
with
fred
when
i
came
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
edith
for
her
tolerance
with
my
uncertain
hours
for
her
cheery
and
the
smiling
good
nature
of
the
servants
she
engages
i
have
a
theory
that
show
me
a
sullen
servant
and
i
will
show
you
a
sullen
mistress
although
edith
herself
disclaims
all
responsibility
and
lays
credit
for
the
smile
with
which
katie
brings
in
my
eggs
and
coffee
to
largess
on
my
part
be
that
as
it
may
katie
is
a
smiling
and
personable
young
woman
and
i
am
convinced
that
had
she
picked
up
the
alligator
on
the
and
lost
part
of
the
end
of
her
thumb
she
would
have
told
edith
that
she
cut
it
off
with
the
bread
knife
and
thus
have
saved
to
us
bessie
the
beloved
and
her
fascinating
trick
of
taking
the
end
of
her
tail
in
her
mouth
and
spinning
on
that
particular
morning
katie
also
brought
me
a
letter
and
i
recognized
the
cramped
and
rather
uncertain
writing
of
miss
jane
maitland
dear
knox
sister
letitia
wishes
me
to
ask
you
if
you
can
dine
with
us
informally
she
has
changed
her
mind
in
regard
to
the
colored
orphans
home
and
would
like
to
consult
you
about
it
very
truly
yours
susan
jane
maitland
it
was
a
very
commonplace
note
i
had
had
one
like
it
after
every
of
the
orphans
home
miss
maitland
being
on
principle
an
aggressive
minority
also
having
considerable
mind
changing
it
became
almost
as
ponderous
an
operation
as
moving
a
barn
although
not
nearly
so
stable
fred
accuses
me
here
of
a
very
bad
pun
and
reminds
me
quite
undeservedly
that
the
pun
is
the
lowest
form
of
humor
i
came
across
miss
jane
letter
the
other
day
when
i
was
gathering
the
material
for
this
narrative
and
i
sat
for
a
time
with
it
in
my
hand
thinking
over
again
the
chain
of
events
in
which
it
had
been
the
first
link
a
series
of
strange
happenings
that
began
with
my
acceptance
of
the
invitation
and
that
led
through
ways
as
dark
and
tricks
as
vain
as
bret
harte
heathen
chinee
ever
dreamed
of
to
the
final
scene
at
the
white
cat
with
the
letter
i
had
filed
away
a
half
dozen
articles
and
i
ranged
them
all
on
the
desk
in
front
of
me
the
letter
the
bit
of
paper
with
eleven
on
it
that
margery
gave
me
the
first
time
i
saw
her
a
filled
with
jerky
characters
that
looked
like
arabic
and
were
newspaper
shorthand
a
railroad
schedule
a
bullet
the
latter
slightly
flattened
a
piece
of
chalk
which
i
put
back
in
its
box
with
a
shudder
and
labeled
and
a
small
gold
buckle
from
a
slipper
which
i
at
which
i
did
not
shudder
i
did
not
need
to
make
the
climaxes
of
my
story
they
lay
before
me
i
walked
to
the
office
that
morning
and
on
the
way
i
found
and
interviewed
the
at
chestnut
and
union
but
he
was
of
small
assistance
he
remembered
the
incident
but
the
gentleman
in
the
taxicab
had
not
been
hurt
and
refused
to
give
his
name
saying
he
was
merely
passing
through
the
city
from
one
railroad
station
to
another
and
did
not
wish
any
notoriety
at
eleven
hunter
called
up
he
said
he
was
going
after
the
affair
himself
but
that
it
was
hard
to
stick
a
dip
net
into
the
political
puddle
without
pulling
out
a
lot
more
than
you
went
after
or
than
it
was
healthy
to
get
he
was
inclined
to
be
facetious
and
wanted
to
know
if
i
had
come
across
any
more
v
whereupon
i
put
away
the
notes
i
had
made
about
delia
and
mamie
brennan
and
i
heard
him
chuckle
as
i
rang
off
i
went
to
bellwood
that
evening
it
was
a
suburban
town
a
dozen
miles
from
the
city
with
a
picturesque
station
surrounded
by
lawns
and
cement
walks
had
so
far
failed
to
spoil
its
streets
and
it
was
exclusive
to
the
point
of
stagnation
the
maitland
place
was
at
the
head
of
the
main
street
which
had
at
one
time
been
its
drive
miss
letitia
who
was
seventy
had
had
sufficient
commercial
instinct
some
years
before
to
cut
her
ancestral
acres
ancestral
acres
although
miss
jane
hardly
counted
into
building
lots
except
perhaps
an
acre
which
surrounded
the
house
thus
the
maitland
ladies
were
reputed
to
be
extremely
wealthy
and
as
they
never
spent
any
money
no
doubt
they
were
the
homestead
as
i
knew
it
was
one
of
impeccable
housekeeping
and
unmitigated
gloom
there
was
a
chill
that
rushed
from
the
center
hall
to
greet
the
on
the
porch
and
that
seemed
to
freeze
up
whatever
in
him
was
spontaneous
and
cheerful
i
had
taken
dinner
at
bellwood
before
and
the
memory
was
not
hilarious
miss
letitia
was
deaf
but
chose
to
ignore
the
fact
with
superb
indifference
she
would
break
into
the
conversation
with
some
wholly
alien
remark
that
necessitated
a
reassembling
of
one
ideas
making
the
meal
a
series
of
mental
gymnastics
miss
jane
through
long
practice
and
because
she
only
skimmed
the
surface
of
conversation
took
her
cerebral
flights
easily
but
i
am
more
unwieldy
of
mind
nor
was
miss
letitia
dominance
wholly
conversational
her
sister
jane
was
her
creature
alternately
snubbed
and
bullied
to
miss
letitia
jane
in
spite
of
her
years
was
still
a
child
and
sometimes
a
bad
one
indeed
many
a
child
of
ten
is
more
sophisticated
miss
letitia
gave
her
expurgated
books
to
read
and
forbade
her
to
read
divorce
court
proceedings
in
the
newspapers
once
a
recreant
housemaid
presenting
the
establishment
with
a
healthy
male
infant
jane
was
sent
to
the
country
for
a
month
and
was
only
brought
back
when
the
house
had
been
fumigated
throughout
poor
miss
jane
she
met
me
with
fluttering
cordiality
in
the
hall
that
night
safe
in
being
herself
for
once
with
the
knowledge
that
miss
letitia
always
received
me
from
a
horsehair
sofa
in
the
back
parlor
she
wore
a
new
lace
cap
and
was
twitteringly
excited
our
niece
is
here
she
explained
as
i
took
off
my
coat
everything
was
ours
with
jane
mine
with
letitia
and
we
are
having
an
ice
at
dinner
please
say
that
ices
are
not
injurious
knox
my
sister
is
so
opposed
to
them
and
i
had
to
beg
for
this
on
the
contrary
the
doctors
have
ordered
ices
for
my
young
nephews
i
said
gravely
and
i
dote
on
them
myself
miss
jane
beamed
indeed
there
was
something
almost
unnaturally
gay
about
the
little
old
lady
all
that
evening
perhaps
it
was
the
new
lace
cap
later
i
tried
to
analyze
her
manner
to
recall
exactly
what
she
had
said
to
remember
anything
that
could
possibly
help
but
i
could
find
no
clue
to
what
followed
miss
letitia
received
me
as
usual
in
the
back
parlor
miss
fleming
was
there
also
sewing
by
a
window
and
in
her
straight
white
dress
with
her
hair
drawn
back
and
braided
around
her
head
she
looked
even
younger
than
before
there
was
no
time
for
conversation
miss
letitia
launched
at
once
into
the
extravagance
of
both
molasses
and
butter
on
the
colored
orphans
bread
and
after
a
glance
at
me
and
a
quick
comprehension
from
my
face
that
i
had
no
news
for
her
the
girl
at
the
window
bent
over
her
sewing
again
molasses
breeds
worms
miss
letitia
said
decisively
so
does
pork
and
yet
those
children
think
heaven
means
ham
and
molasses
three
times
a
day
you
have
had
no
news
at
all
miss
fleming
said
cautiously
her
head
bent
over
her
work
none
i
returned
under
cover
of
the
table
linen
to
which
miss
letitia
mind
had
veered
i
have
a
good
man
working
on
it
as
she
glanced
at
me
questioningly
it
needed
a
detective
miss
fleming
evidently
another
day
without
news
had
lessened
her
distrust
of
the
police
for
she
nodded
acquiescence
and
went
on
with
her
sewing
miss
letitia
monotonous
monologue
went
on
and
i
gave
it
such
attention
as
i
might
for
the
lamps
had
been
lighted
and
with
every
movement
of
the
girl
across
i
could
see
the
gleaming
of
a
diamond
on
her
engagement
finger
if
i
did
watch
her
jane
would
ruin
them
said
miss
letitia
she
gives
apples
when
they
keep
their
faces
clean
and
the
bills
for
soap
have
gone
up
double
soap
once
a
day
enough
for
a
colored
child
do
you
smell
anything
burning
knox
i
sniffed
and
lied
whereupon
miss
letitia
swept
her
black
silk
her
colored
orphans
and
her
majestic
presence
out
of
the
room
as
the
door
closed
miss
fleming
put
down
her
sewing
and
rose
for
the
first
time
i
saw
how
weary
she
looked
i
do
not
dare
to
tell
them
knox
she
said
they
are
old
and
they
hate
him
anyhow
i
could
sleep
last
night
suppose
he
should
have
gone
back
and
found
the
house
closed
he
would
telephone
here
at
once
would
he
i
suggested
i
suppose
so
yes
she
took
up
her
sewing
from
the
chair
with
a
sigh
but
i
afraid
he
wo
come
not
soon
i
have
hemmed
tea
towels
for
aunt
letitia
until
i
am
frantic
and
all
day
i
have
been
wondering
over
something
you
said
yesterday
you
said
you
remember
that
you
were
not
a
detective
that
some
men
could
take
nineteen
from
and
leave
nothing
what
did
you
mean
i
was
speechless
for
a
moment
the
fact
is
i
you
see
i
blundered
it
was
a
merely
a
figure
of
speech
a
speech
of
figures
is
more
accurate
and
then
dinner
was
announced
and
i
was
saved
but
although
she
said
little
or
nothing
during
the
meal
i
caught
her
looking
across
at
me
once
or
twice
in
a
bewildered
puzzled
fashion
i
could
fairly
see
her
revolving
my
detestable
figures
in
her
mind
miss
letitia
presided
over
the
table
in
garrulous
majesty
the
two
old
ladies
picked
at
their
food
and
miss
jane
had
a
spot
of
pink
in
each
withered
cheek
margery
fleming
made
a
brave
pretense
but
left
her
plate
almost
untouched
as
for
me
i
ate
a
substantial
masculine
meal
and
half
apologized
for
my
appetite
but
letitia
did
not
hear
she
tore
the
board
of
managers
to
shreds
with
the
roast
and
denounced
them
with
the
salad
but
jane
was
all
anxious
hospitality
please
eat
your
dinner
she
whispered
i
made
the
salad
myself
and
i
know
what
it
takes
to
keep
a
big
man
going
harry
eats
more
than
letitia
and
i
together
does
he
margery
harry
i
asked
stevens
is
an
unmitigated
fool
i
said
if
they
elected
her
president
i
not
leave
a
penny
to
the
home
that
why
i
sent
for
you
knox
and
to
the
maid
tell
heppie
to
wash
those
cups
in
water
they
the
best
ones
and
not
to
drink
her
coffee
out
of
them
she
let
her
teeth
slip
and
bit
a
piece
out
of
one
the
last
time
miss
jane
leaned
forward
to
me
after
a
smiling
glance
at
her
niece
across
harry
wardrop
a
cousin
son
and
she
patted
margery
hand
with
its
ring
soon
to
be
something
closer
the
girl
face
colored
but
she
returned
miss
jane
gentle
pressure
they
put
up
an
iron
fence
miss
letitia
reverted
somberly
to
her
grievance
when
a
wooden
one
would
have
done
it
was
extravagance
ruinous
extravagance
harry
stays
with
us
when
he
is
in
manchester
miss
jane
went
on
nodding
brightly
across
at
letitia
as
if
she
too
were
damning
the
executive
board
lately
he
has
been
almost
all
the
time
in
plattsburg
he
is
secretary
to
margery
father
it
is
a
position
of
considerable
responsibility
and
we
are
very
proud
of
him
i
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
but
the
remainder
of
the
meal
had
somehow
lost
its
savor
there
was
a
lull
in
the
conversation
while
dessert
was
being
brought
in
miss
jane
sat
quivering
watching
her
sister
face
for
signs
of
trouble
the
latter
had
subsided
into
muttered
grumbling
and
miss
fleming
sat
one
hand
on
the
table
staring
absently
at
her
engagement
ring
you
look
like
a
fool
in
that
cap
jane
volunteered
letitia
while
the
plates
were
being
brought
in
what
for
dessert
called
miss
jane
over
the
table
well
you
need
snapped
letitia
i
can
hear
you
well
enough
you
told
me
it
was
junket
i
said
and
you
said
it
would
be
all
right
poor
jane
shrieked
if
you
drink
a
cup
of
hot
water
after
it
it
wo
hurt
you
fiddle
letitia
snapped
unpleasantly
i
not
going
to
freeze
my
stomach
and
then
thaw
it
out
like
a
drain
pipe
tell
heppie
to
put
my
on
the
stove
so
we
waited
until
miss
letitia
had
been
heated
and
was
brought
in
sicklied
over
with
pale
hues
not
of
thought
but
of
dyes
miss
letitia
ate
it
resignedly
like
as
not
i
break
out
i
did
the
last
time
she
said
gloomily
i
only
hope
i
do
break
out
in
colors
the
meal
was
over
finally
but
if
i
had
hoped
for
another
word
alone
with
margery
fleming
that
evening
i
was
foredoomed
to
disappointment
letitia
sent
the
girl
not
ungently
to
bed
and
ordered
jane
out
of
the
room
with
a
single
curt
gesture
toward
the
door
you
better
wash
those
cups
yourself
jane
she
said
i
do
see
any
sense
anyhow
in
getting
out
the
best
china
unless
there
real
company
besides
i
going
to
talk
business
poor
meek
spiritless
miss
jane
the
situation
was
absurd
in
spite
of
its
pathos
she
confided
to
me
once
that
never
in
her
years
of
life
had
she
bought
herself
a
gown
or
chosen
the
dinner
she
was
snubbed
with
painstaking
perseverance
and
sent
out
of
the
room
when
subjects
requiring
frank
handling
were
under
discussion
she
was
as
unsophisticated
as
a
child
of
ten
as
unworldly
as
a
baby
as
well
poor
miss
jane
again
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
miss
letitia
listened
for
a
moment
got
up
suddenly
and
crossing
the
room
with
amazing
swiftness
for
her
years
pounced
on
the
knob
and
threw
it
open
again
but
the
passage
was
empty
miss
jane
slim
little
figure
was
disappearing
into
the
kitchen
the
older
sister
watched
her
out
of
sight
and
then
returned
to
her
sofa
without
deigning
explanation
i
did
want
to
see
you
about
the
will
knox
she
began
without
prelude
the
will
can
wait
i
ai
going
to
die
just
yet
not
if
i
know
anything
but
although
i
think
you
look
a
heap
better
and
more
responsible
if
you
wore
some
hair
on
your
face
still
in
most
things
i
think
you
a
man
of
sense
and
you
not
too
young
that
why
i
did
send
for
harry
wardrop
he
too
young
i
winced
at
that
miss
letitia
leaned
forward
and
put
her
bony
hand
on
my
knee
i
been
robbed
she
announced
in
a
half
whisper
and
straightened
to
watch
the
effect
of
her
words
indeed
i
said
properly
thunderstruck
i
surprised
i
had
always
believed
that
only
the
use
of
the
fourth
dimension
in
space
would
enable
any
one
not
desired
to
gain
access
to
the
maitland
house
of
money
not
money
although
i
had
a
good
bit
in
the
house
this
also
i
knew
it
was
said
of
miss
letitia
that
when
money
came
into
her
possession
it
went
out
of
circulation
not
the
pearls
i
asked
she
answered
my
question
with
another
when
you
had
those
pearls
appraised
for
me
at
the
jewelers
last
year
how
many
were
there
not
quite
one
hundred
i
think
yes
exactly
she
corroborated
in
triumph
they
belonged
to
my
mother
margery
mother
got
some
of
them
that
a
good
many
years
ago
young
man
they
are
worth
more
than
they
were
then
a
great
deal
more
thousand
dollars
i
repeated
you
remember
miss
letitia
that
i
protested
vigorously
at
the
time
against
your
keeping
them
in
the
house
miss
letitia
ignored
this
but
before
she
went
on
she
repeated
again
her
pouncing
at
the
door
only
to
find
the
hall
empty
as
before
this
time
when
she
sat
down
it
was
knee
to
knee
with
me
yesterday
morning
she
said
gravely
i
got
down
the
box
they
have
always
been
kept
in
the
small
safe
in
the
top
of
my
closet
when
jane
found
a
picture
of
my
niece
margery
fleming
in
harry
room
i
thought
it
likely
there
was
some
truth
in
the
gossip
jane
heard
about
the
two
and
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
wedding
why
the
pearls
were
to
go
to
margery
anyhow
but
i
found
the
door
of
the
safe
unlocked
and
a
little
bit
open
and
ten
of
the
pearls
were
gone
gone
i
echoed
ten
of
them
why
it
ridiculous
if
ten
why
not
the
whole
how
do
i
know
she
replied
with
asperity
that
what
i
keep
a
lawyer
for
that
why
i
sent
for
you
for
the
second
time
in
two
days
i
protested
the
same
thing
but
you
need
a
detective
i
cried
if
you
can
find
the
thief
i
will
be
glad
to
send
him
where
he
ought
to
be
but
i
could
find
him
i
will
not
have
the
police
she
persisted
inflexibly
they
will
come
around
asking
impertinent
questions
and
telling
the
newspapers
that
a
foolish
old
woman
had
got
what
she
deserved
then
you
are
going
to
send
them
to
a
bank
you
have
less
sense
than
i
thought
she
snapped
i
am
going
to
leave
them
where
they
are
and
watch
whoever
took
the
ten
will
be
back
for
more
mark
my
words
i
do
advise
it
i
said
decidedly
you
have
most
of
them
now
and
you
might
easily
lose
them
all
not
only
that
but
it
is
not
safe
for
you
or
your
sister
stuff
and
nonsense
the
old
lady
said
with
spirit
as
for
jane
she
does
even
know
they
are
gone
i
know
who
did
it
it
was
the
new
housemaid
bella
mackenzie
nobody
else
could
get
in
i
lock
up
the
house
myself
at
night
and
i
in
the
habit
of
doing
a
pretty
thorough
job
of
it
they
went
in
the
last
three
weeks
for
i
counted
them
saturday
three
weeks
ago
myself
the
only
persons
in
the
house
in
that
time
except
ourselves
were
harry
bella
and
hepsibah
who
been
here
for
forty
years
and
would
know
a
pearl
from
a
pickled
onion
then
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
asked
have
bella
arrested
and
her
trunk
searched
i
felt
myself
shrinking
in
the
old
lady
esteem
every
minute
her
trunk
she
said
scornfully
i
turned
it
inside
out
this
morning
pretending
i
thought
she
was
stealing
the
laundry
soap
like
as
not
she
has
them
buried
in
the
vegetable
garden
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
stay
here
for
three
or
four
nights
to
be
on
hand
when
i
catch
the
thief
i
want
my
lawyer
right
by
it
ended
by
my
consenting
of
course
miss
letitia
was
seldom
refused
i
telephoned
to
fred
that
i
would
not
be
home
listened
for
voices
and
decided
margery
fleming
had
gone
to
bed
miss
jane
lighted
me
to
the
door
of
the
guest
room
and
saw
that
everything
was
comfortable
her
thin
gray
curls
bobbed
as
she
examined
the
water
pitcher
saw
to
the
towels
and
felt
the
bed
linen
for
dampness
at
the
door
she
stopped
and
turned
around
timidly
has
has
anything
happened
to
disturb
my
sister
she
asked
she
has
been
almost
irritable
all
day
almost
she
is
worried
about
her
colored
orphans
i
evaded
she
does
not
approve
of
fireworks
for
them
on
the
fourth
of
july
miss
jane
was
satisfied
i
watched
her
little
old
figure
go
lightly
down
the
hall
then
i
bolted
the
door
opened
all
the
windows
and
proceeded
to
a
surreptitious
smoke
chapter
iv
a
thief
in
the
night
the
windows
being
wide
open
it
was
not
long
before
a
great
moth
came
whirring
in
he
hurled
himself
at
the
light
and
then
dazzled
and
singed
began
to
beat
with
noisy
thumps
against
the
barrier
of
the
ceiling
finding
no
egress
there
he
was
back
at
the
lamp
again
whirling
in
dizzy
circles
until
at
last
worn
out
he
dropped
to
the
table
where
he
lay
on
his
back
kicking
impotently
the
room
began
to
fill
with
tiny
winged
creatures
that
flung
themselves
headlong
to
destruction
so
i
put
out
the
light
and
sat
down
near
the
window
with
my
cigar
and
my
thoughts
miss
letitia
troubles
i
dismissed
shortly
while
it
was
odd
that
only
ten
pearls
should
have
been
taken
still
in
every
other
way
it
bore
the
marks
of
an
ordinary
theft
the
thief
might
have
thought
that
by
leaving
the
majority
of
the
gems
he
could
postpone
discovery
indefinitely
but
the
fleming
case
was
of
a
different
order
taken
by
itself
disappearance
could
have
been
easily
accounted
for
there
must
be
times
in
the
lives
of
all
unscrupulous
individuals
when
they
feel
the
need
of
retiring
temporarily
from
the
public
eye
but
the
intrusion
into
the
fleming
home
the
ransacked
desk
and
the
broken
money
drawer
most
of
all
the
bit
of
paper
with
eleven
on
it
here
was
a
hurdle
my
legal
mind
refused
to
take
i
had
finished
my
second
cigar
and
was
growing
more
and
more
wakeful
when
i
heard
a
footstep
on
the
path
around
the
house
it
was
black
outside
when
i
looked
out
as
i
did
cautiously
i
could
not
see
even
the
of
the
cement
walk
the
steps
had
ceased
but
there
was
a
sound
of
fumbling
at
one
of
the
shutters
below
the
catch
clicked
twice
as
if
some
thin
instrument
was
being
slipped
underneath
to
raise
it
and
once
i
caught
a
muttered
exclamation
i
drew
in
my
head
and
puffing
my
cigar
until
it
was
glowing
managed
by
its
light
to
see
that
it
was
a
quarter
to
two
when
i
listened
again
the
had
moved
to
another
window
and
was
shaking
it
cautiously
with
miss
letitia
story
of
the
pearls
fresh
in
my
mind
i
felt
at
once
that
the
thief
finding
his
ten
a
prize
had
come
back
for
more
my
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
the
head
of
my
bed
where
i
am
accustomed
to
keep
a
revolver
with
the
touch
of
the
tall
corner
post
however
i
remembered
that
i
was
not
at
home
and
that
it
was
not
likely
there
was
a
weapon
in
the
house
finally
after
knocking
over
an
ornament
that
shattered
on
the
hearth
and
sounded
like
the
crash
of
doom
i
found
on
the
mantel
a
heavy
brass
candlestick
and
with
it
in
my
hand
i
stepped
into
the
gloom
of
the
hallway
and
felt
my
way
to
the
stairs
there
were
no
night
lights
the
darkness
was
total
i
found
the
stairs
before
i
expected
to
and
came
within
an
ace
of
pitching
down
headlong
i
had
kicked
off
my
shoes
a
fact
which
i
regretted
later
once
down
the
stairs
i
was
on
more
familiar
territory
i
went
at
once
into
the
library
which
was
beneath
my
room
but
the
sounds
at
the
window
had
ceased
i
thought
i
heard
steps
on
the
walk
going
toward
the
front
of
the
house
i
wheeled
quickly
and
started
for
the
door
when
something
struck
me
a
terrific
blow
on
the
nose
i
reeled
back
and
sat
down
dizzy
and
shocked
it
was
only
when
no
second
blow
followed
the
first
that
i
realized
what
had
occurred
with
my
two
hands
out
before
me
in
the
blackness
i
had
groped
one
hand
on
either
side
of
the
open
door
which
of
course
i
had
struck
violently
with
my
nose
afterward
i
found
it
had
bled
considerably
and
my
collar
and
tie
must
have
added
to
my
ghastly
appearance
my
candlestick
had
rolled
under
the
table
and
after
crawling
around
on
my
hands
and
knees
i
found
it
i
had
lost
i
suppose
three
or
four
minutes
and
i
was
raging
at
my
awkwardness
and
stupidity
no
one
however
seemed
to
have
heard
the
noise
for
all
her
boasted
watchfulness
miss
letitia
must
have
been
asleep
i
got
back
into
the
hall
and
from
there
to
the
some
one
was
fumbling
at
the
shutters
there
and
as
i
looked
they
swung
open
it
was
so
dark
outside
with
the
trees
and
the
distance
from
the
street
that
only
the
creaking
of
the
shutter
told
it
had
opened
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
one
hand
firmly
clutching
my
candlestick
but
the
window
refused
to
move
the
burglar
seemed
to
have
no
proper
tools
he
got
something
under
the
sash
but
it
snapped
and
through
the
heavy
i
could
hear
him
swearing
then
he
abruptly
left
the
window
and
made
for
the
front
of
the
house
i
blundered
in
the
same
direction
my
unshod
feet
striking
on
projecting
furniture
and
causing
me
agonies
even
through
my
excitement
when
i
reached
the
front
door
however
i
was
amazed
to
find
it
unlocked
and
standing
open
perhaps
an
inch
i
stopped
uncertainly
i
was
in
a
peculiar
position
not
even
the
most
ardent
admirers
of
antique
brass
candlesticks
indorse
them
as
weapons
of
offense
or
defense
but
there
seeming
to
be
nothing
else
to
do
i
opened
the
door
quietly
and
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
the
next
instant
i
was
flung
heavily
to
the
porch
floor
i
am
not
a
small
man
by
any
means
but
under
the
fury
of
that
onslaught
i
was
a
child
it
was
a
porch
chair
i
think
that
knocked
me
senseless
i
know
i
folded
up
like
a
and
that
was
all
i
did
know
for
a
few
minutes
when
i
came
to
i
was
lying
where
i
had
fallen
and
a
candle
was
burning
beside
me
on
the
porch
floor
it
took
me
a
minute
to
remember
and
another
minute
to
realize
that
i
was
looking
into
the
barrel
of
a
revolver
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
a
more
villainous
face
than
that
of
the
man
who
held
it
which
shows
my
state
of
mind
and
that
my
position
was
the
reverse
of
comfortable
then
the
man
behind
the
gun
spoke
what
did
you
do
with
that
bag
he
demanded
and
i
felt
his
knee
on
my
chest
what
bag
i
inquired
feebly
my
head
was
jumping
and
the
candle
was
a
volcanic
eruption
of
sparks
and
smoke
do
be
a
fool
the
gentleman
with
the
revolver
persisted
if
i
do
get
that
bag
within
five
minutes
i
fill
you
as
full
of
holes
as
a
cheese
i
have
seen
any
bag
i
said
stupidly
what
sort
of
bag
i
heard
my
own
voice
drunk
from
the
shock
paper
bag
laundry
bag
you
hidden
it
in
the
house
he
said
bringing
the
revolver
a
little
closer
with
every
word
my
senses
came
back
with
a
jerk
and
i
struggled
to
free
myself
go
in
and
look
i
responded
let
me
up
from
here
and
i
take
you
in
myself
the
man
face
was
a
study
in
amazement
and
anger
you
take
me
in
you
he
got
up
without
changing
the
menacing
position
of
the
gun
you
walk
in
there
here
carry
the
candle
and
take
me
to
that
bag
quick
do
you
hear
i
was
too
bewildered
to
struggle
i
got
up
dizzily
but
when
i
tried
to
stoop
for
the
candle
i
almost
fell
on
it
my
head
cleared
after
a
moment
and
when
i
had
picked
up
the
candle
i
had
a
good
chance
to
look
at
my
assailant
he
was
staring
at
me
too
he
was
a
young
fellow
well
dressed
and
haggard
beyond
belief
i
do
know
anything
about
a
bag
i
persisted
but
if
you
will
give
me
your
word
there
was
nothing
in
it
belonging
to
this
house
i
will
take
you
in
and
let
you
look
for
it
the
next
moment
he
had
lowered
the
revolver
and
clutched
my
arm
who
in
the
devil
name
you
he
asked
wildly
i
think
the
thing
dawned
on
us
both
at
the
same
moment
my
name
is
knox
i
said
coolly
feeling
for
my
handkerchief
my
head
was
bleeding
from
a
cut
over
the
ear
john
knox
knox
instead
of
showing
relief
his
manner
showed
greater
consternation
than
ever
he
snatched
the
candle
from
me
and
holding
it
up
searched
my
face
then
good
god
where
is
my
i
have
something
in
my
head
where
you
hit
me
i
said
perhaps
that
is
it
but
my
sarcasm
was
lost
on
him
i
am
harry
wardrop
he
said
and
i
have
been
robbed
knox
i
was
trying
to
get
in
the
house
without
waking
the
family
and
when
i
came
back
here
to
the
front
door
where
i
had
left
my
valise
it
was
gone
i
thought
you
were
the
thief
when
you
came
out
and
we
lost
all
this
time
somebody
has
followed
me
and
robbed
me
what
was
in
the
bag
i
asked
stepping
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
and
looking
around
with
the
help
of
the
candle
valuable
papers
he
said
shortly
he
seemed
to
be
dazed
and
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
we
had
both
instinctively
kept
our
voices
low
you
are
certain
you
left
it
here
i
asked
the
thing
seemed
incredible
in
the
quiet
and
peace
of
that
neighborhood
where
you
are
standing
once
more
i
began
a
desultory
search
going
down
the
steps
and
looking
among
the
cannas
that
bordered
the
porch
something
glistened
beside
the
step
and
stooping
down
i
discovered
a
small
brown
leather
apparently
quite
new
here
it
is
i
said
not
so
gracious
as
i
might
have
been
i
had
suffered
considerably
for
that
the
sight
of
it
restored
wardrop
poise
at
once
his
twitching
features
relaxed
by
jove
i
glad
to
see
it
he
said
i
ca
explain
but
tremendous
things
were
depending
on
that
bag
knox
i
know
how
to
apologize
to
you
i
must
have
nearly
brained
you
you
did
i
said
grimly
and
gave
him
the
bag
the
moment
he
took
it
i
knew
there
was
something
wrong
he
hurried
into
the
house
and
lighted
the
library
lamp
then
he
opened
the
with
shaking
fingers
it
was
empty
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
incredulously
into
it
then
he
hurled
it
down
on
the
table
and
turned
on
me
as
i
stood
beside
him
it
a
trick
he
said
furiously
you
hidden
it
somewhere
this
is
not
my
bag
you
substituted
one
just
like
it
do
be
a
fool
i
retorted
how
could
i
substitute
an
empty
satchel
for
yours
when
up
to
fifteen
minutes
ago
i
had
never
seen
you
or
your
grip
either
use
a
little
common
sense
some
place
you
have
put
down
that
bag
and
some
clever
thief
has
substituted
a
similar
one
an
old
trick
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
it
impossible
he
said
after
a
pause
while
he
seemed
to
be
going
over
minute
by
minute
the
events
of
the
night
i
was
followed
as
far
as
that
goes
in
plattsburg
two
men
watched
me
from
the
minute
i
got
there
on
tuesday
i
changed
my
hotel
and
for
all
of
yesterday
wednesday
that
is
i
felt
secure
enough
but
on
my
way
to
the
train
i
felt
that
i
was
under
surveillance
again
and
by
turning
quickly
i
came
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
men
would
you
know
him
i
asked
yes
i
thought
he
was
a
detective
you
know
i
had
a
lot
of
that
sort
of
thing
lately
with
election
coming
on
he
did
get
on
the
train
however
but
the
other
one
may
have
done
so
yes
the
other
one
may
the
thing
i
do
understand
is
this
knox
when
we
drew
in
at
bellwood
station
i
distinctly
remember
opening
the
bag
and
putting
my
newspaper
and
railroad
schedule
inside
it
was
the
right
bag
then
my
clothing
was
in
it
and
my
brushes
i
had
been
examining
the
empty
bag
as
he
talked
where
did
you
put
your
railroad
schedule
i
asked
in
the
leather
pocket
at
the
side
it
is
here
i
said
drawing
out
the
yellow
folder
for
a
moment
my
companion
looked
almost
haunted
he
pressed
his
hands
to
his
head
and
began
to
pace
the
room
like
a
crazy
man
the
whole
thing
is
impossible
i
tell
you
that
valise
was
heavy
when
i
walked
up
from
the
station
i
changed
it
from
one
hand
to
the
other
because
of
the
weight
when
i
got
here
i
set
it
down
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
and
tried
the
door
when
i
found
it
locked
but
it
was
locked
i
broke
in
when
i
came
to
look
for
a
burglar
i
found
it
open
at
least
an
inch
he
stopped
in
his
pacing
up
and
down
and
looked
at
me
curiously
we
both
crazy
then
he
asserted
gravely
i
tell
you
i
tried
every
way
i
knew
to
unlock
that
door
and
could
hear
the
chain
rattling
unlocked
you
do
know
the
way
this
house
is
fastened
up
at
night
nevertheless
it
was
unlocked
when
i
came
down
we
were
so
engrossed
that
neither
of
us
had
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
the
sound
of
a
smothered
exclamation
from
the
doorway
caused
us
both
to
turn
suddenly
standing
there
in
a
loose
gown
of
some
sort
very
much
surprised
and
startled
was
margery
fleming
wardrop
pulled
himself
together
at
once
as
for
me
i
knew
what
sort
of
figure
i
cut
my
collar
stained
with
blood
a
lump
on
my
forehead
that
felt
as
big
as
a
and
no
shoes
what
the
matter
she
asked
uncertainly
i
heard
such
queer
noises
and
i
thought
some
one
had
broken
into
the
house
wardrop
was
trying
to
break
in
i
explained
and
i
heard
him
and
came
down
on
the
way
i
had
a
bloody
encounter
with
an
open
door
in
which
i
came
out
the
loser
i
do
think
she
quite
believed
me
she
looked
from
my
swollen
head
to
the
open
bag
and
then
to
wardrop
pale
face
then
i
think
she
remembered
the
two
great
braids
that
hung
over
her
shoulders
and
the
she
wore
for
she
backed
precipitately
into
the
hall
i
glad
that
all
it
is
she
called
back
cautiously
and
we
could
hear
her
running
up
the
stairs
you
better
go
to
bed
wardrop
said
picking
up
his
hat
i
going
down
to
the
station
there
no
train
out
of
here
between
midnight
and
a
flag
train
at
it
not
likely
to
be
of
any
use
but
i
want
to
see
who
goes
on
that
train
it
is
only
half
past
two
i
said
glancing
at
my
watch
we
might
look
around
outside
first
the
necessity
for
action
made
him
welcome
any
suggestion
reticent
as
he
was
his
feverish
excitement
made
me
think
that
something
vital
hung
on
the
recovery
of
the
contents
of
that
russia
leather
bag
we
found
a
lantern
somewhere
in
the
back
of
the
house
and
together
we
went
over
the
grounds
it
did
not
take
long
and
we
found
nothing
as
i
look
back
on
that
night
the
key
to
what
had
passed
and
to
much
that
was
coming
was
so
simple
so
direct
and
yet
we
missed
it
entirely
nor
when
bigger
things
developed
and
hunter
trained
senses
were
brought
into
play
did
he
do
much
better
it
was
some
time
before
we
learned
the
true
inwardness
of
the
events
of
that
night
at
five
in
the
morning
wardrop
came
back
exhausted
and
nerveless
no
one
had
taken
the
the
contents
of
the
bag
were
gone
probably
beyond
recall
i
put
my
dented
candlestick
back
on
the
mantel
and
prepared
for
a
little
sleep
blessing
the
deafness
of
old
age
which
had
enabled
the
maitland
ladies
to
sleep
through
it
all
i
tried
to
forget
the
queer
events
of
the
night
but
the
throbbing
of
my
head
kept
me
awake
and
through
it
all
one
question
obtruded
itself
who
had
unlocked
the
front
door
and
left
it
open
chapter
v
little
miss
jane
i
was
almost
unrecognizable
when
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
mirror
the
next
morning
preparatory
to
dressing
for
breakfast
my
nose
boasted
a
new
arch
like
the
back
of
an
angry
cat
making
my
profile
roman
and
ferocious
and
the
lump
on
my
forehead
from
the
chair
was
swollen
glassy
and
purple
i
turned
my
back
to
the
mirror
and
dressed
in
wrathful
irritation
and
my
yesterday
linen
miss
fleming
was
in
the
when
i
got
down
standing
at
a
window
her
back
to
me
i
have
carried
with
me
during
all
the
months
since
that
time
a
mental
picture
of
her
as
she
stood
there
in
a
pink
morning
frock
of
some
sort
but
only
the
other
day
having
mentioned
this
to
her
she
assured
me
that
the
frock
was
blue
that
she
have
a
pink
garment
at
the
time
this
story
opens
and
that
if
she
did
she
positively
did
have
it
on
and
having
thus
flouted
my
eye
for
color
she
maintains
that
she
did
have
her
back
to
me
for
she
distinctly
saw
my
bridge
as
i
came
down
the
stairs
so
i
amend
this
miss
fleming
in
a
blue
frock
was
facing
the
door
when
i
went
into
the
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
she
came
forward
and
held
out
her
hand
good
morning
she
said
what
a
terrible
face
it
is
mine
i
replied
meekly
my
own
face
is
beneath
these
excrescences
i
tried
to
cover
the
bump
on
my
forehead
with
french
chalk
but
it
only
accentuated
the
thing
like
snow
on
a
mountain
top
purple
peaks
of
darien
she
quoted
pouring
me
my
coffee
do
you
know
i
feel
so
much
better
since
you
have
taken
hold
of
things
aunt
letitia
thinks
you
are
wonderful
i
thought
ruefully
of
the
failure
of
my
first
attempt
to
play
the
sleuth
and
i
disclaimed
any
right
to
miss
letitia
high
opinion
of
me
from
my
dogging
the
watchman
to
the
police
station
to
delia
and
her
note
was
a
short
mental
step
before
any
one
comes
down
miss
fleming
i
said
i
want
to
ask
a
question
or
two
what
was
the
name
of
the
maid
who
helped
you
search
the
house
that
night
annie
what
other
maids
did
you
say
there
were
delia
and
rose
do
you
know
anything
about
them
where
they
came
from
or
where
they
went
she
smiled
a
little
what
does
one
know
about
new
servants
she
responded
they
bring
you
references
but
references
are
the
price
most
women
pay
to
get
rid
of
their
servants
without
a
fuss
rose
was
fat
and
old
but
delia
was
pretty
i
thought
she
rather
liked
carter
carter
as
well
as
shields
the
policeman
i
put
miss
delia
down
as
a
flirt
and
you
have
no
idea
where
carter
went
none
wardrop
came
in
then
and
we
spoke
of
other
things
the
two
elderly
ladies
it
seemed
had
tea
and
toast
in
their
rooms
when
they
wakened
and
the
three
of
us
breakfasted
together
but
conversation
languished
with
wardrop
appearance
he
looked
haggard
and
worn
avoided
miss
fleming
eyes
and
after
ordering
eggs
instead
of
his
chop
looked
at
his
watch
and
left
without
touching
anything
i
want
to
get
the
margie
he
said
coming
back
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
i
may
not
be
out
to
dinner
tell
miss
letitia
will
you
he
turned
to
go
but
on
second
thought
came
back
to
me
and
held
out
his
hand
i
may
not
see
you
again
he
began
not
if
i
see
you
first
i
interrupted
he
glanced
at
my
mutilated
features
and
smiled
i
have
made
you
a
maitland
he
said
i
did
think
that
anything
but
a
prodigal
nature
could
duplicate
miss
letitia
nose
i
honestly
sorry
knox
and
if
you
do
not
want
miss
jane
at
that
bump
with
a
cold
silver
knife
and
some
butter
you
better
duck
before
she
comes
down
margie
i
think
the
girl
was
as
much
baffled
as
i
was
by
the
change
in
his
manner
when
he
spoke
to
her
his
smile
faded
and
he
hardly
met
her
eyes
i
thought
that
his
aloofness
puzzled
rather
than
hurt
her
when
the
house
door
had
closed
behind
him
she
dropped
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
looked
across
the
table
you
did
not
tell
me
the
truth
last
night
knox
she
said
i
have
never
seen
harry
look
like
that
something
has
happened
to
him
he
was
robbed
of
his
i
explained
on
fred
theory
that
half
a
truth
is
better
than
a
poor
lie
it
a
humiliating
experience
i
believe
a
man
will
throw
away
thousands
or
gamble
them
away
with
more
equanimity
than
he
see
some
one
making
off
with
his
hair
brushes
or
his
clean
collars
his
she
repeated
scornfully
knox
something
has
happened
to
my
father
and
you
and
harry
are
hiding
it
from
me
on
my
honor
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
i
hastened
to
assure
her
i
saw
him
for
only
a
few
minutes
just
long
enough
for
him
to
wreck
my
appearance
he
did
not
speak
of
father
no
she
got
up
and
crossing
to
the
wooden
mantel
put
her
arms
upon
it
and
leaned
her
head
against
them
i
wanted
to
ask
him
she
said
drearily
but
i
am
afraid
to
suppose
he
does
know
and
i
should
tell
him
he
would
go
to
schwartz
at
once
and
schwartz
is
treacherous
the
papers
would
get
it
too
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
i
felt
as
awkward
as
a
man
always
does
when
a
woman
begins
to
cry
if
he
knows
her
well
enough
he
can
go
over
and
pat
her
on
the
shoulder
and
assure
her
it
is
going
to
be
all
right
if
he
does
not
know
her
and
there
are
two
maiden
aunts
likely
to
come
in
at
any
minute
he
sits
still
as
i
did
and
waits
until
the
storm
clears
miss
margery
was
not
long
in
emerging
from
her
handkerchief
i
did
sleep
much
she
explained
dabbing
at
her
eyes
and
i
am
nervous
anyhow
knox
are
you
sure
it
was
only
harry
trying
to
get
into
the
house
last
night
only
harry
i
repeated
if
wardrop
attempt
to
get
into
the
house
leaves
me
in
this
condition
what
would
a
real
burglar
have
done
to
me
she
was
too
intent
to
be
sympathetic
over
my
disfigured
face
there
was
some
one
moving
about
not
long
before
i
came
down
she
said
slowly
you
heard
me
i
almost
fell
down
the
stairs
did
you
brush
past
my
door
and
strike
the
knob
she
demanded
no
i
was
not
near
any
door
very
well
triumphantly
some
one
did
not
only
that
but
they
were
in
the
on
the
floor
above
i
could
hear
one
person
and
perhaps
two
going
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
back
again
you
heard
a
goblin
quadrille
first
couple
forward
and
back
i
said
facetiously
i
heard
real
footsteps
unmistakable
ones
the
maids
sleep
back
on
the
second
floor
and
do
tell
me
it
was
rats
there
are
no
rats
in
my
aunt
letitia
house
i
was
more
impressed
than
i
cared
to
show
i
found
i
had
a
half
hour
before
train
time
and
as
we
were
neither
of
us
eating
anything
i
suggested
that
we
explore
the
upper
floor
of
the
house
i
did
it
i
explained
not
because
i
expected
to
find
anything
but
because
i
was
sure
we
would
not
we
crept
past
the
two
closed
doors
behind
which
the
ladies
maitland
were
presumably
taking
out
their
crimps
and
taking
in
their
tea
then
up
a
narrow
obtrusively
clean
stairway
to
the
upper
floor
it
was
an
attic
with
narrow
windows
and
a
bare
floor
at
one
end
a
door
opened
into
a
large
room
and
in
there
were
the
family
trunks
of
four
generations
of
maitlands
one
on
another
they
were
all
piled
there
little
hair
trunks
trunks
huge
saratogas
of
the
period
when
the
two
maiden
ladies
were
in
their
late
teens
and
there
were
handsome
modern
trunks
too
for
miss
satisfaction
i
made
an
examination
of
the
room
but
it
showed
nothing
there
was
little
or
no
dust
to
have
been
disturbed
the
windows
were
closed
and
locked
in
the
main
attic
were
two
some
curtains
drying
on
frames
and
an
old
chest
of
drawers
with
glass
knobs
and
the
veneering
broken
in
places
one
of
the
drawers
stood
open
and
inside
could
be
seen
a
red
and
white
patchwork
quilt
and
a
grayish
thing
that
looked
like
flannel
and
smelled
to
heaven
of
camphor
we
gave
up
finally
and
started
down
part
way
down
the
attic
stairs
margery
stopped
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
rail
following
her
gaze
i
stopped
too
and
i
felt
a
sort
of
chill
go
over
me
no
spot
or
blemish
no
dirty
finger
print
marked
the
whiteness
of
that
stair
rail
except
in
one
place
on
it
clear
and
distinct
every
line
of
the
palm
showing
was
the
reddish
imprint
of
a
hand
margery
did
not
speak
she
had
turned
very
white
and
closed
her
eyes
but
she
was
not
faint
when
the
first
revulsion
had
passed
i
reached
over
and
touched
the
stain
it
was
quite
dry
of
course
but
it
was
still
another
hour
or
two
would
see
it
black
it
was
evidently
fresh
hunter
said
afterward
it
must
have
been
about
six
hours
old
and
as
things
transpired
he
was
right
the
stain
showed
a
hand
somewhat
short
and
broad
with
widened
marked
in
ink
it
would
not
have
struck
me
so
forcibly
perhaps
but
there
its
ugly
red
against
the
white
wood
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
imprint
of
a
brutal
murderous
hand
margery
was
essentially
feminine
what
did
i
tell
you
she
asked
some
one
was
in
this
house
last
night
i
heard
them
distinctly
there
must
have
been
two
and
they
quarreled
she
shuddered
we
went
on
into
the
quiet
and
peace
of
the
again
i
got
some
hot
coffee
for
margery
for
she
looked
shaken
and
found
i
had
missed
my
train
i
am
beginning
to
think
i
am
being
pursued
by
a
malicious
spirit
she
said
trying
to
smile
i
came
away
from
home
because
people
got
into
the
house
at
night
and
left
queer
signs
of
their
visits
and
now
here
at
bellwood
where
nothing
happens
the
moment
i
arrive
things
begin
to
occur
and
just
as
it
was
at
home
the
house
was
so
well
locked
last
night
i
did
not
tell
her
of
the
open
hall
door
just
as
i
had
kept
from
her
the
fact
that
only
the
contents
of
harry
wardrop
bag
had
been
taken
that
it
had
all
been
the
work
of
one
person
and
that
that
person
having
in
some
way
access
to
the
house
had
also
stolen
the
pearls
was
now
my
confident
belief
i
looked
at
bella
the
maid
as
she
moved
around
the
her
stolid
face
was
not
even
intelligent
certainly
not
cunning
heppie
the
cook
and
only
other
servant
was
partly
blind
and
her
horizon
was
the
diameter
of
her
largest
kettle
no
it
had
not
been
a
servant
this
mysterious
intruder
who
passed
the
maitland
silver
on
the
sideboard
without
an
attempt
to
take
it
and
who
floundered
around
an
attic
at
night
in
search
of
nothing
more
valuable
than
patchwork
quilts
and
winter
flannels
it
is
strange
to
look
back
and
think
how
quietly
we
sat
there
that
we
could
see
nothing
but
burglary
or
an
attempt
at
it
in
what
we
had
found
it
must
have
been
after
nine
when
bella
came
running
into
the
room
ordinarily
a
slow
and
clumsy
creature
she
almost
flew
she
had
a
tray
in
her
hand
and
the
dishes
were
rattling
and
threatening
overthrow
at
every
step
she
brought
up
against
a
chair
and
a
cup
went
flying
the
breaking
of
a
cup
must
have
been
a
serious
offense
in
miss
letitia
maitland
house
but
bella
took
no
notice
whatever
of
it
miss
jane
she
gasped
miss
jane
she
she
hurt
margery
exclaimed
rising
and
clutching
at
the
table
for
support
no
gone
she
gone
she
been
run
off
with
nonsense
i
said
seeing
margery
horrified
face
do
come
in
here
with
such
a
story
if
miss
jane
is
not
in
her
room
she
is
somewhere
else
that
all
bella
stooped
and
gathered
up
the
broken
cup
her
lips
moving
margery
had
recovered
herself
she
made
bella
straighten
and
explain
do
you
mean
she
is
not
in
her
room
she
asked
incredulously
she
somewhere
around
the
house
go
up
and
look
at
the
room
the
girl
replied
and
with
margery
leading
we
ran
up
the
stairs
miss
jane
room
was
empty
from
somewhere
near
miss
letitia
could
be
heard
lecturing
hepsibah
about
putting
too
much
butter
on
the
toast
her
high
voice
pitched
for
heppie
old
ears
rasped
me
margery
closed
the
door
and
we
surveyed
the
room
together
the
bed
had
been
occupied
its
coverings
had
been
thrown
back
as
if
its
occupant
had
risen
hurriedly
the
room
itself
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
a
rocker
lay
on
its
side
and
miss
jane
clothing
folded
as
she
had
taken
it
off
had
slid
off
on
to
the
floor
her
shoes
stood
neatly
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
a
bottle
of
toilet
vinegar
had
been
upset
pouring
a
stream
over
the
marble
top
of
the
dresser
and
down
on
to
the
floor
over
the
high
wooden
mantel
the
maitland
who
had
been
governor
of
the
state
years
ago
hung
at
a
waggish
angle
and
a
clock
had
been
pushed
aside
and
stopped
at
one
margery
stared
around
her
in
bewilderment
of
course
it
was
not
until
later
in
the
day
that
i
saw
all
the
details
my
first
impression
was
of
confusion
and
disorder
the
room
seemed
to
have
been
the
scene
of
a
struggle
the
overturned
furniture
the
clothes
on
the
floor
the
picture
coupled
with
the
print
of
the
hand
on
the
staircase
and
miss
jane
disappearance
all
seemed
to
point
to
one
thing
and
as
if
to
prove
it
conclusively
margery
picked
up
miss
jane
new
lace
cap
from
the
floor
it
was
crumpled
and
spotted
with
blood
she
has
been
killed
margery
said
in
a
choking
voice
killed
and
she
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
but
where
is
she
i
asked
stupidly
margery
had
more
presence
of
mind
than
i
had
i
suppose
it
is
because
woman
courage
is
mental
and
man
physical
that
in
times
of
great
strain
women
always
make
the
better
showing
while
i
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
staring
at
the
confusion
around
me
margery
was
already
on
her
knees
looking
under
the
high
bed
finding
nothing
there
she
went
to
the
closet
it
was
undisturbed
pathetic
rows
of
limp
black
dresses
and
on
the
shelves
two
black
crepe
bonnets
were
mute
reminders
of
the
little
old
lady
but
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
room
call
robert
the
gardener
margery
said
quickly
and
have
him
help
you
search
the
grounds
and
cellars
i
will
take
bella
and
go
through
the
house
above
everything
keep
it
from
aunt
letitia
as
long
as
possible
i
locked
the
door
into
the
disordered
room
and
with
my
head
whirling
i
went
to
look
for
robert
it
takes
a
short
time
to
search
an
acre
of
lawn
and
shrubbery
there
was
no
trace
of
the
missing
woman
anywhere
outside
the
house
and
from
bella
as
she
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
front
stairs
with
her
apron
over
her
head
i
learned
in
a
monosyllable
that
nothing
had
been
found
in
the
house
margery
was
with
miss
letitia
and
from
the
excited
conversation
i
knew
she
was
telling
her
not
harrowing
details
but
that
miss
jane
had
disappeared
during
the
night
the
old
lady
was
inclined
to
scoff
at
first
look
in
the
fruit
closet
in
the
i
heard
her
say
let
the
spring
lock
shut
on
her
twice
she
was
black
in
the
face
the
last
time
we
found
her
i
did
look
she
not
there
margery
screamed
at
her
then
she
out
looking
for
stump
water
to
take
that
wart
off
her
neck
she
said
yesterday
she
was
going
for
some
but
her
clothes
are
all
here
margery
persisted
we
think
some
one
must
have
got
in
the
house
if
all
her
clothes
are
there
she
been
miss
letitia
said
calmly
we
used
to
have
to
tie
her
by
a
cord
around
her
ankle
and
fasten
it
to
the
bedpost
when
she
tried
to
get
up
the
cord
would
pull
and
wake
her
i
think
after
a
time
however
some
of
margery
uneasiness
communicated
itself
to
the
older
woman
she
finished
dressing
and
fumed
when
we
told
her
we
had
locked
miss
jane
door
and
mislaid
the
key
finally
margery
got
her
settled
in
the
back
parlor
with
some
peppermints
and
her
knitting
she
had
a
feeling
she
said
that
jane
had
gone
after
the
stump
water
and
lost
her
way
and
i
told
margery
to
keep
her
in
that
state
of
mind
as
long
as
she
could
i
sent
for
hunter
that
morning
and
he
came
at
three
i
took
him
through
the
back
entrance
to
avoid
miss
letitia
i
think
he
had
been
skeptical
until
i
threw
open
the
door
and
showed
him
the
upset
chair
the
old
lady
clothing
and
the
bloodstained
lace
cap
his
examination
was
quick
and
thorough
he
took
a
crumpled
sheet
of
note
paper
out
of
the
and
looked
at
it
then
he
stuffed
it
in
his
pocket
he
sniffed
the
toilet
water
called
margery
and
asked
her
if
any
clothing
was
missing
and
on
receiving
a
negative
answer
asked
if
any
shawls
or
wraps
were
gone
from
the
halls
or
other
rooms
margery
reported
nothing
missing
before
he
left
the
room
hunter
went
back
and
moved
the
picture
which
had
been
disturbed
over
the
mantel
what
he
saw
made
him
get
a
chair
and
standing
on
it
take
the
picture
from
its
nail
thus
exposed
the
wall
showed
an
opening
about
a
foot
square
and
perhaps
eighteen
inches
deep
a
metal
door
opening
in
was
unfastened
and
ajar
and
just
inside
was
a
copy
of
a
recent
sentimental
novel
and
a
bottle
of
some
sort
of
complexion
cream
in
spite
of
myself
i
smiled
it
was
so
typical
of
the
dear
old
lady
with
the
heart
of
a
girl
and
a
skin
that
was
losing
its
roses
but
there
was
something
else
in
the
receptacle
something
that
made
margery
fleming
draw
in
her
breath
sharply
and
made
hunter
raise
his
eyebrows
a
little
and
glance
at
me
the
something
was
a
scrap
of
unruled
white
paper
and
on
it
the
figures
eleven
chapter
vi
a
fountain
pen
harry
wardrop
came
back
from
the
city
at
four
while
hunter
was
in
the
midst
of
his
investigation
i
met
him
in
the
hall
and
told
him
what
had
happened
and
with
this
new
apprehension
added
to
the
shock
of
the
night
before
he
looked
as
though
his
nerves
were
ready
to
snap
wardrop
was
a
man
of
perhaps
as
tall
as
i
although
not
so
heavy
with
direct
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
altogether
a
manly
and
prepossessing
sort
of
fellow
i
was
not
surprised
that
margery
fleming
had
found
him
attractive
he
had
the
blond
hair
and
manner
that
women
seem
to
like
i
am
dark
myself
he
seemed
surprised
to
find
hunter
there
and
not
particularly
pleased
but
he
followed
us
to
the
upper
floor
and
watched
silently
while
hunter
went
over
the
two
rooms
beside
the
large
chest
of
drawers
in
the
main
attic
hunter
found
perhaps
half
a
dozen
drops
of
blood
and
on
the
edge
of
the
open
drawer
there
were
traces
of
more
in
the
inner
room
two
trunks
had
been
moved
out
nearly
a
foot
as
he
found
by
the
faint
dust
that
had
been
under
them
with
the
stain
on
the
stair
rail
that
was
all
he
discovered
and
it
was
little
enough
then
he
took
out
his
and
there
among
the
trunks
we
had
a
little
seance
of
our
own
in
which
hunter
asked
questions
and
whoever
could
do
so
answered
them
have
you
a
pencil
or
pen
mr
knox
he
asked
me
but
i
had
none
wardrop
felt
his
pockets
with
no
better
success
i
have
lost
my
fountain
pen
somewhere
around
the
house
he
said
irritably
here
a
pencil
not
much
of
one
hunter
began
his
interrogations
how
old
was
miss
maitland
miss
jane
i
mean
from
margery
she
had
always
seemed
rational
not
eccentric
or
childish
not
at
all
the
sanest
woman
i
ever
knew
this
from
wardrop
has
she
ever
to
your
knowledge
received
any
threatening
letters
never
in
all
her
life
from
both
of
them
promptly
you
heard
sounds
you
say
miss
fleming
at
what
time
about
one
or
perhaps
a
few
minutes
later
the
clock
struck
two
while
i
was
still
awake
and
nervous
this
person
who
was
walking
through
the
attics
here
would
you
say
it
was
a
heavy
person
a
man
i
mean
margery
stopped
to
think
yes
she
said
finally
it
was
very
stealthy
but
i
think
it
was
a
man
step
you
heard
no
sound
of
a
struggle
no
voices
no
screams
none
at
all
she
said
positively
and
i
added
my
quota
there
could
have
been
no
such
sounds
i
said
i
sat
in
my
room
and
smoked
until
a
quarter
to
two
i
heard
nothing
until
then
when
i
heard
wardrop
trying
to
get
into
the
house
i
went
down
to
admit
him
and
i
found
the
front
door
open
about
an
inch
hunter
wheeled
on
wardrop
a
quarter
to
two
he
asked
you
were
coming
home
from
the
city
yes
from
the
station
hunter
watched
him
closely
the
last
train
gets
in
here
at
he
said
slowly
does
it
always
take
you
an
hour
and
a
quarter
to
walk
the
three
squares
to
the
house
wardrop
flushed
uneasily
and
i
could
see
margery
eyes
dilate
with
amazement
as
for
me
i
could
only
stare
i
did
not
come
directly
home
he
said
almost
defiantly
hunter
voice
was
as
smooth
as
silk
then
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
where
you
did
go
he
asked
i
have
reasons
for
wanting
to
know
damn
your
reasons
i
beg
your
pardon
margery
look
here
hunter
do
you
think
i
would
hurt
a
hair
of
that
old
lady
head
do
you
think
i
came
here
last
night
and
killed
her
or
whatever
it
is
that
has
happened
to
her
and
then
went
out
and
tried
to
get
in
again
through
the
window
not
necessarily
hunter
said
unruffled
it
merely
occurred
to
me
that
we
have
at
least
an
hour
of
your
time
last
night
while
this
thing
was
going
on
to
account
for
however
we
can
speak
of
that
later
i
am
practically
certain
of
one
thing
miss
maitland
is
not
dead
or
was
not
dead
when
she
was
taken
away
from
this
house
taken
away
margery
repeated
then
you
think
she
was
kidnapped
well
it
is
possible
it
a
puzzling
affair
all
through
you
are
certain
there
are
no
closets
or
unused
rooms
where
if
there
had
been
a
murder
the
body
could
be
concealed
i
never
heard
of
any
margery
said
but
i
saw
wardrop
face
change
on
the
instant
he
said
nothing
however
but
stood
frowning
at
the
floor
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
coat
pockets
margery
was
beginning
to
show
the
effect
of
the
long
day
strain
she
began
to
cry
a
little
and
with
an
air
of
proprietorship
that
i
resented
somehow
wardrop
went
over
to
her
you
are
going
to
lie
down
margery
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
to
help
her
up
mellon
will
come
over
to
aunt
letitia
and
you
must
get
some
sleep
sleep
she
said
with
scorn
as
he
helped
her
to
her
feet
sleep
when
things
like
this
are
occurring
father
first
and
now
dear
old
aunt
jane
harry
do
you
know
where
my
father
is
he
faced
her
as
if
he
had
known
the
question
must
come
and
was
prepared
for
it
i
know
that
he
is
all
right
margery
he
has
been
out
of
town
if
it
had
not
been
for
something
unforeseen
that
happened
within
the
last
few
hours
he
would
have
been
home
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
aunt
jane
she
asked
hunter
from
the
head
of
the
attic
stairs
you
do
not
think
she
is
dead
not
until
we
have
found
something
more
he
answered
tactlessly
like
where
there
smoke
there
fire
where
there
murder
there
a
body
when
they
had
both
gone
hunter
sat
down
on
a
trunk
and
drew
out
a
cigar
that
looked
like
a
bomb
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
asked
when
he
showed
no
disposition
to
talk
i
be
damned
if
i
know
he
responded
looking
around
for
some
place
to
expectorate
and
finding
none
the
window
i
suggested
and
he
went
over
to
it
when
he
came
back
he
had
a
rather
peculiar
expression
he
sat
down
and
puffed
for
a
moment
in
the
first
place
he
began
we
can
take
it
for
granted
that
unless
she
was
crazy
or
she
did
go
out
in
her
and
there
nothing
of
hers
missing
she
was
taken
in
a
carriage
providing
she
was
taken
at
all
there
not
a
mark
of
wheels
on
that
drive
newer
than
a
week
and
besides
you
say
you
heard
nothing
nothing
i
said
positively
then
unless
she
went
away
in
a
balloon
where
it
would
matter
what
she
had
on
she
is
still
around
the
premises
it
depends
on
how
badly
she
was
hurt
are
you
sure
it
was
she
who
was
hurt
i
asked
that
print
of
a
hand
that
is
not
miss
jane
in
reply
hunter
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
to
the
place
where
the
stain
on
the
stair
rail
stood
out
ugly
and
distinct
he
put
his
own
heavy
hand
on
the
rail
just
below
it
suppose
he
said
suppose
you
grip
something
very
hard
what
happens
to
your
hand
it
spreads
i
acknowledged
seeing
what
he
meant
now
look
at
that
stain
look
at
the
short
fingers
why
it
a
hand
beside
mine
the
breadth
is
from
pressure
it
might
be
figured
out
this
way
the
fingers
you
notice
point
down
the
stairs
in
some
way
let
us
say
the
burglar
for
want
of
a
better
name
gets
into
the
house
he
used
a
ladder
resting
against
that
window
by
the
chest
of
drawers
ladder
i
exclaimed
yes
there
is
a
pruning
ladder
there
now
then
he
comes
down
these
stairs
and
he
has
a
definite
object
he
knows
of
something
valuable
in
that
cubby
hole
over
the
mantel
in
miss
jane
room
how
does
he
get
in
the
door
into
the
upper
hall
is
closed
and
bolted
but
the
door
into
the
is
open
from
there
another
door
leads
into
the
bedroom
and
it
has
no
bolt
only
a
key
that
kind
of
a
lock
is
only
a
delay
or
less
now
then
miss
maitland
was
a
light
sleeper
when
she
wakened
she
was
too
alarmed
to
scream
she
tried
to
get
to
the
door
and
was
intercepted
finally
she
got
out
the
way
the
intruder
got
in
and
ran
along
the
hall
every
door
was
locked
in
a
frenzy
she
ran
up
the
attic
stairs
and
was
captured
up
there
which
bears
out
miss
story
of
the
footsteps
back
and
forward
good
heavens
what
an
awful
thing
i
gasped
and
i
was
sitting
smoking
just
across
the
hall
he
brings
her
down
the
stairs
again
probably
half
dragging
her
once
she
catches
hold
of
the
stair
rail
and
holds
desperately
to
it
leaving
the
stain
here
but
why
did
he
bring
her
down
i
asked
bewildered
why
would
he
take
what
he
was
after
and
get
away
hunter
smoked
and
meditated
she
probably
had
to
get
the
key
of
the
iron
door
he
suggested
it
was
hidden
and
time
was
valuable
if
there
was
a
scapegrace
member
of
the
family
for
instance
who
knew
where
the
old
lady
kept
money
and
who
needed
it
badly
who
knew
all
about
the
house
and
who
fleming
i
exclaimed
aghast
or
even
our
young
friend
wardrop
hunter
said
quietly
he
has
an
hour
to
account
for
the
trying
to
get
in
may
have
been
a
blind
and
how
do
you
know
that
what
he
says
was
stolen
out
of
his
satchel
was
not
what
he
had
just
got
from
the
iron
box
over
the
mantel
in
miss
room
i
was
dizzy
with
trying
to
follow
hunter
facile
imagination
the
thing
we
were
trying
to
do
was
to
find
the
old
lady
and
after
all
here
we
brought
up
against
the
same
then
where
is
she
now
i
asked
he
meditated
he
had
sat
down
on
the
narrow
stairs
and
was
rubbing
his
chin
with
a
thoughtful
forefinger
miss
margery
says
when
she
heard
the
noise
when
you
heard
wardrop
at
the
shutters
i
tell
you
knox
it
is
one
of
two
things
either
that
woman
is
dead
somewhere
in
this
house
or
she
ran
out
of
the
hall
door
just
before
you
went
and
in
that
case
the
lord
only
knows
where
she
is
if
there
is
a
room
anywhere
that
we
have
not
explored
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
is
i
broke
in
thinking
of
face
a
few
minutes
before
and
just
then
wardrop
himself
joined
us
he
closed
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
came
quietly
up
you
spoke
about
an
unused
room
or
a
secret
closet
hunter
he
said
without
any
resentment
in
his
tone
we
have
nothing
so
sensational
as
that
but
the
old
house
is
full
of
queer
nooks
and
crannies
and
perhaps
in
one
of
them
we
might
find
he
stopped
and
gulped
whatever
hunter
might
think
whatever
i
might
have
against
harry
wardrop
i
determined
then
that
he
had
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
little
miss
maitland
strange
disappearance
the
first
place
we
explored
was
a
closed
and
long
unused
and
to
which
access
was
gained
by
a
small
window
in
the
stone
foundation
of
the
house
the
cobwebs
over
the
window
made
it
practically
an
impossible
place
but
we
put
robert
the
gardener
through
it
in
spite
of
his
protests
there
nothin
there
i
tell
you
he
protested
with
one
leg
over
the
coping
god
only
knows
what
down
there
after
all
these
years
been
livin
here
with
the
miss
maitlands
for
twenty
year
and
i
never
been
put
to
goin
down
into
cellars
on
the
end
of
a
rope
he
went
because
we
were
three
to
his
one
but
he
was
up
again
in
sixty
seconds
with
the
announcement
that
the
place
was
as
bare
as
the
top
of
his
head
we
moved
every
trunk
in
the
although
it
would
have
been
a
moral
impossibility
for
any
one
to
have
done
it
the
night
before
without
rousing
the
entire
family
and
were
thus
able
to
get
to
and
open
a
large
closet
which
proved
to
contain
neatly
tied
and
labeled
packages
of
religious
weeklies
beginning
in
the
sixties
the
grounds
had
been
gone
over
inch
by
inch
without
affording
any
clue
and
now
the
three
of
us
faced
one
another
the
day
was
almost
gone
and
we
were
exactly
where
we
started
hunter
had
sent
men
through
the
town
and
the
adjacent
countryside
but
no
word
had
come
from
them
miss
letitia
had
at
last
succumbed
to
the
suspense
and
had
gone
to
bed
where
she
lay
quietly
enough
as
is
the
way
with
the
old
but
so
mild
that
she
was
alarming
at
five
hawes
called
me
up
from
the
office
and
almost
tearfully
implored
me
to
come
back
and
attend
to
my
business
when
i
said
it
was
impossible
i
could
hear
him
groan
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
hawes
is
of
the
opinion
that
by
keeping
fresh
magazines
in
my
and
by
persuading
me
to
the
extravagance
of
turkish
rugs
that
he
has
built
my
practice
to
its
present
flourishing
state
when
i
left
the
telephone
hunter
was
preparing
to
go
back
to
town
and
wardrop
was
walking
up
and
down
the
hall
suddenly
wardrop
stopped
his
uneasy
promenade
and
hailed
the
detective
on
his
way
to
the
door
by
george
he
exclaimed
i
forgot
to
show
you
the
closet
under
the
attic
stairs
we
hurried
up
and
wardrop
showed
us
the
panel
in
the
hall
which
slid
to
one
side
when
he
pushed
a
bolt
under
the
carpet
the
blackness
of
the
closet
was
horrible
in
its
suggestion
to
me
i
stepped
back
while
hunter
struck
a
match
and
looked
in
the
closet
was
empty
better
not
go
in
wardrop
said
it
has
been
used
for
years
and
it
black
with
dust
i
found
it
myself
and
showed
it
to
miss
jane
i
do
believe
miss
letitia
knows
it
is
here
it
has
been
used
for
years
reflected
hunter
looking
around
him
curiously
i
suppose
it
has
been
some
time
since
you
were
in
here
mr
wardrop
several
years
wardrop
replied
carelessly
i
used
to
keep
contraband
here
in
my
college
days
cigarettes
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
been
in
it
since
then
hunter
took
his
foot
off
a
small
object
that
lay
on
the
floor
and
picking
it
up
held
it
out
to
wardrop
with
a
grim
smile
here
is
the
fountain
pen
you
lost
this
morning
wardrop
he
said
quietly
chapter
vii
concerning
margery
when
hunter
had
finally
gone
at
six
summoned
to
town
on
urgent
business
we
were
very
nearly
where
we
had
been
before
he
came
he
could
only
give
us
theories
and
after
all
what
we
wanted
was
fact
and
miss
jane
many
things
however
that
he
had
unearthed
puzzled
me
why
had
wardrop
lied
about
so
small
a
matter
as
his
fountain
pen
the
closet
was
empty
what
object
could
he
have
had
in
saying
he
had
not
been
in
it
for
years
i
found
that
my
belief
in
his
sincerity
of
the
night
before
was
going
if
he
had
been
lying
then
i
owed
him
something
for
a
lump
on
my
head
that
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
wear
my
hat
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
for
him
to
rob
himself
and
if
he
had
an
eye
for
the
theatrical
to
work
out
just
some
such
plot
it
was
even
possible
that
he
had
hidden
for
a
few
hours
in
the
secret
closet
the
contents
of
the
russia
leather
bag
but
whatever
wardrop
might
or
might
not
be
he
gave
me
little
chance
to
find
out
for
he
left
the
house
before
hunter
did
that
afternoon
and
it
was
later
and
under
strange
circumstances
that
i
met
him
again
hunter
had
not
told
me
what
was
on
the
paper
he
had
picked
out
of
the
basket
in
miss
jane
room
and
i
knew
he
was
as
much
puzzled
as
i
at
the
scrap
in
the
little
cupboard
with
eleven
on
it
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
mean
the
day
of
the
eleventh
month
perhaps
something
that
had
happened
on
some
momentous
of
november
but
this
was
may
and
the
finding
of
two
slips
bearing
the
same
number
was
too
unusual
after
hunter
left
i
went
back
to
the
closet
under
the
upper
stairs
and
with
some
difficulty
got
the
panel
open
again
the
space
inside
perhaps
eight
feet
high
at
one
end
and
four
at
the
other
was
empty
there
was
a
row
of
hooks
as
if
at
some
time
clothing
had
been
hung
there
and
a
flat
shelf
at
one
end
gray
with
dust
i
struck
another
match
and
examined
the
shelf
on
its
surface
were
numerous
scratchings
in
the
dust
layer
but
at
one
end
marked
out
as
if
drawn
on
a
blackboard
was
a
rectangular
outline
apparently
that
of
a
smallish
box
and
fresh
my
match
burned
my
fingers
and
i
dropped
it
to
the
floor
where
it
expired
in
a
sickly
blue
flame
at
the
last
however
it
died
heroically
like
an
old
man
to
whom
his
last
hours
bring
back
some
of
the
glory
of
his
prime
burning
brightly
for
a
second
and
then
fading
into
darkness
the
last
flash
showed
me
on
the
floor
of
the
closet
and
wedged
between
two
boards
a
small
white
globule
it
did
not
need
another
match
to
tell
me
it
was
a
pearl
i
dug
it
out
carefully
and
took
it
to
my
room
in
the
daylight
there
i
recognized
it
as
an
unstrung
pearl
of
fair
size
and
considerable
value
there
could
hardly
be
a
doubt
that
i
had
stumbled
on
one
of
the
stolen
gems
but
a
pearl
was
only
a
pearl
to
me
after
all
i
did
feel
any
of
the
inspirations
which
fiction
detectives
experience
when
they
happen
on
an
important
clue
i
lit
a
cigar
and
put
the
pearl
on
the
table
in
front
of
me
but
no
explanation
formed
itself
in
the
tobacco
smoke
if
wardrop
took
the
pearls
i
kept
repeating
over
and
over
if
wardrop
took
the
pearls
who
took
miss
jane
i
tried
to
forget
the
pearls
and
to
fathom
the
connection
between
miss
maitland
disappearance
and
the
absence
of
her
the
scrap
of
paper
eleven
must
connect
them
but
how
a
family
scandal
dismissed
on
the
instant
there
could
be
nothing
that
would
touch
the
virginal
remoteness
of
that
little
old
lady
insanity
well
miss
jane
might
have
had
a
sudden
aberration
and
wandered
away
but
that
would
leave
fleming
out
and
the
paper
dragged
him
in
a
common
enemy
i
smoked
and
considered
for
some
time
over
this
an
especially
malignant
foe
might
rob
or
even
murder
but
it
was
almost
ludicrous
to
think
of
his
carrying
away
by
force
miss
jane
ninety
pounds
of
austere
flesh
the
solution
had
it
not
been
for
the
might
have
been
a
peaceful
one
leaving
out
the
pearls
altogether
but
later
developments
showed
that
the
pearls
refused
to
be
omitted
to
my
mind
however
at
that
time
the
issue
seemed
a
double
one
i
believed
that
some
one
perhaps
harry
wardrop
had
stolen
the
pearls
hidden
them
in
the
secret
closet
and
disposed
of
them
later
i
made
a
note
to
try
to
follow
up
the
missing
pearls
then
i
clung
to
the
theory
that
miss
maitland
had
been
abducted
and
was
being
held
for
ransom
if
i
could
have
found
traces
of
a
vehicle
of
any
sort
near
the
house
i
would
almost
have
considered
my
contention
proved
that
any
one
could
have
entered
the
house
intimidated
and
even
slightly
injured
the
old
lady
and
taken
her
quietly
out
the
front
door
while
i
sat
smoking
in
my
room
with
the
window
open
and
wardrop
trying
the
shutters
at
the
side
of
the
house
seemed
impossible
yet
there
were
the
stains
the
confusion
the
open
front
door
to
prove
it
but
and
i
stuck
here
the
abductor
who
would
steal
an
old
woman
and
take
her
out
into
the
may
night
without
any
covering
not
even
shoes
clad
only
in
her
would
run
an
almost
certain
risk
of
losing
his
prize
by
pneumonia
for
a
second
search
had
shown
not
an
article
of
wearing
apparel
missing
from
the
house
even
the
cedar
chests
were
undisturbed
not
a
blanket
was
gone
just
before
dinner
i
made
a
second
round
of
the
grounds
this
time
looking
for
traces
of
wheels
i
found
none
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
boldest
highwayman
would
hardly
drive
up
to
the
door
for
his
booty
when
i
had
extended
my
search
to
cover
the
unpaved
lane
that
separated
the
back
of
the
maitland
place
from
its
nearest
neighbor
i
was
more
fortunate
the
morning
delivery
wagons
had
made
fresh
trails
and
at
first
i
despaired
i
sauntered
up
the
lane
to
the
right
however
and
about
a
hundred
feet
beyond
the
boundary
hedge
i
found
circular
tracks
broad
and
deep
where
an
automobile
had
backed
and
turned
the
lane
was
separated
by
high
hedges
of
osage
orange
from
the
properties
on
either
side
and
each
house
in
that
neighborhood
had
a
drive
of
its
own
which
entered
from
the
main
street
circled
the
house
and
went
out
as
it
came
there
was
no
reason
or
so
far
as
i
could
see
no
legitimate
reason
why
a
car
should
have
stopped
there
yet
it
had
stopped
and
for
some
time
deeper
tracks
in
the
sand
at
the
side
of
the
lane
showed
that
i
felt
that
i
had
made
some
progress
i
had
found
where
the
pearls
had
been
hidden
after
the
theft
and
this
put
bella
out
of
the
question
and
i
had
found
or
thought
i
had
the
way
in
which
miss
jane
had
been
taken
away
from
bellwood
i
came
back
past
the
long
rear
wing
of
the
house
which
contained
i
presumed
the
kitchen
and
the
other
mysterious
regions
which
only
women
and
architects
comprehend
a
long
porch
ran
the
length
of
the
wing
and
as
i
passed
i
heard
my
name
called
in
here
in
the
old
laundry
margery
voice
repeated
and
i
retraced
my
steps
and
went
up
on
the
porch
at
the
very
end
of
the
wing
dismantled
piled
at
the
sides
with
firewood
and
broken
furniture
was
an
old
laundry
its
tubs
were
rusty
its
walls
mildewed
and
streaked
and
it
exhaled
the
musty
odor
of
empty
houses
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
undeniably
dirty
and
dishevelled
sat
margery
fleming
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
she
said
petulantly
i
have
been
here
alone
for
an
hour
i
sure
i
never
guessed
it
i
apologized
i
should
have
been
only
too
glad
to
come
and
sit
with
you
she
was
fumbling
with
her
hair
which
threatened
to
come
down
any
minute
and
which
hung
loosely
knotted
over
one
small
ear
i
hate
to
look
ridiculous
she
said
sharply
and
i
detest
being
laughed
at
i
been
crying
and
i
have
any
handkerchief
i
proffered
mine
gravely
and
she
took
it
she
wiped
the
dusty
streaks
off
her
cheeks
and
pinned
her
hair
in
a
funny
knob
on
top
of
her
head
that
would
have
made
any
other
woman
look
like
a
caricature
but
still
she
sat
on
the
floor
now
she
said
when
she
had
jabbed
the
last
into
place
and
tucked
my
handkerchief
into
her
belt
if
you
have
been
sufficiently
amused
perhaps
you
will
help
me
out
of
here
out
of
where
do
you
suppose
i
sitting
here
because
i
like
it
you
have
sprained
your
ankle
i
said
with
sudden
alarm
in
reply
she
brushed
aside
her
gown
and
for
the
first
time
i
saw
what
had
occurred
she
was
sitting
half
over
a
in
the
floor
which
had
closed
on
her
skirts
and
held
her
fast
the
wretched
thing
she
wailed
and
i
have
called
until
i
am
hoarse
i
could
shake
heppie
then
i
tried
to
call
you
mentally
i
fixed
my
mind
on
you
and
said
over
and
over
please
come
did
you
feel
anything
at
all
good
old
i
said
i
know
i
was
thinking
about
you
but
i
never
suspected
the
reason
and
then
to
have
walked
past
here
twenty
minutes
ago
why
did
you
call
me
then
i
was
tugging
at
the
door
but
it
was
fast
with
the
skirts
to
hold
it
tight
i
looked
such
a
fright
she
explained
ca
you
pry
it
up
with
something
i
tried
several
things
without
success
while
margery
explained
her
plight
i
was
sure
robert
had
not
looked
carefully
in
the
old
wine
cellar
she
said
and
then
i
remembered
this
opened
into
it
it
was
the
only
place
we
had
explored
thoroughly
i
put
a
ladder
down
and
looked
around
ugh
what
did
you
find
i
asked
as
my
third
broomstick
lever
snapped
nothing
only
i
know
now
where
aunt
letitia
edwin
booth
went
to
he
was
a
cat
she
explained
and
aunt
letitia
made
the
railroad
pay
for
killing
him
i
gave
up
finally
and
stood
back
could
you
er
get
out
of
your
garments
and
i
could
go
out
and
close
the
door
i
suggested
delicately
you
see
you
are
sitting
on
the
and
but
margery
scouted
the
suggestion
with
the
proper
scorn
and
demanded
a
pair
of
scissors
she
cut
herself
loose
with
vicious
snips
while
i
paraphrased
the
old
nursery
rhyme
she
cut
her
petticoats
all
around
about
then
she
gathered
up
her
outraged
garments
and
fled
precipitately
she
was
unusually
dignified
at
dinner
neither
of
us
cared
to
eat
and
the
empty
places
wardrop
and
miss
letitia
miss
jane
had
not
been
set
were
like
skeletons
at
the
board
it
was
margery
who
after
our
pretense
of
a
meal
voiced
the
suspicion
i
think
we
both
felt
it
is
a
strange
time
for
harry
to
go
away
she
said
quietly
from
the
library
window
he
probably
has
a
reason
why
do
you
say
it
she
said
suddenly
turning
on
me
i
know
what
you
think
you
believe
he
only
pretended
he
was
robbed
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
anything
of
the
kind
i
began
but
she
did
not
allow
me
to
finish
i
saw
what
you
thought
she
burst
out
bitterly
the
detective
almost
laughed
in
his
face
oh
you
need
think
i
do
know
i
saw
him
last
night
and
the
woman
too
he
brought
her
right
to
the
gate
you
treat
me
like
a
child
all
of
you
in
sheer
amazement
i
was
silent
so
a
new
character
had
been
introduced
into
the
play
a
woman
too
you
were
not
the
only
person
knox
who
could
not
sleep
last
night
she
went
on
oh
i
know
a
great
many
things
i
know
about
the
pearls
and
what
you
think
about
them
and
i
know
more
than
that
i
she
stopped
then
she
had
said
more
than
she
intended
to
and
all
at
once
her
bravado
left
her
and
she
looked
like
a
frightened
child
i
went
over
to
her
and
took
one
trembling
hand
i
wish
you
did
know
all
those
things
i
said
but
since
you
do
wo
you
let
me
share
the
burden
the
only
reason
i
am
still
here
is
on
your
account
i
had
a
sort
of
crazy
desire
to
take
her
in
my
arms
and
comfort
her
wardrop
or
no
wardrop
but
at
that
moment
luckily
for
me
perhaps
miss
letitia
shrill
old
voice
came
from
the
stairway
get
out
of
my
way
heppie
she
was
saying
tartly
i
not
on
my
yet
not
if
i
know
it
where
knox
whereupon
i
obediently
went
out
and
helped
miss
letitia
into
the
room
i
think
i
know
where
jane
is
she
said
putting
down
her
cane
with
a
jerk
i
do
know
why
i
did
think
about
it
before
she
gone
to
get
her
new
teeth
she
been
talkin
of
it
for
a
month
not
but
what
her
old
teeth
would
have
done
well
enough
she
would
hardly
go
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
returned
she
was
a
very
timid
woman
was
she
she
was
raised
right
miss
letitia
said
with
a
shake
of
her
head
she
the
baby
and
the
youngest
always
spoiled
have
you
thought
that
this
might
be
more
than
it
appears
to
be
i
was
feeling
my
way
she
was
a
very
old
woman
it
for
instance
it
might
be
abduction
kidnapping
for
a
ransom
ransom
miss
letitia
snapped
knox
my
father
made
his
money
by
working
hard
for
it
i
have
wasted
it
not
that
i
know
of
and
if
jane
maitland
was
fool
enough
to
be
abducted
she
stay
a
while
before
i
pay
anything
for
her
it
looks
to
me
as
if
this
detective
business
was
going
to
be
expensive
anyhow
my
excuse
for
dwelling
with
such
attention
to
detail
on
the
preliminary
story
the
disappearance
of
miss
jane
maitland
and
the
peculiar
circumstances
surrounding
it
will
have
to
find
its
justification
in
the
events
that
followed
it
miss
jane
herself
and
the
solution
of
that
mystery
solved
the
even
more
tragic
one
in
which
we
were
about
to
be
involved
i
say
because
it
was
borne
in
on
me
at
about
that
time
that
the
things
that
concerned
margery
fleming
must
concern
me
henceforth
whether
i
willed
it
so
or
otherwise
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
woman
step
on
the
stair
was
like
no
other
sound
in
the
world
chapter
viii
too
late
at
nine
that
night
things
remained
about
the
same
the
man
hunter
had
sent
to
investigate
the
neighborhood
and
the
country
just
outside
of
the
town
came
to
the
house
about
eight
and
reported
nothing
discovered
miss
letitia
went
to
bed
early
and
margery
took
her
hunter
called
me
by
telephone
from
town
can
you
take
the
up
he
asked
i
looked
at
my
watch
yes
i
think
so
is
there
anything
new
not
yet
there
may
be
take
a
cab
at
the
station
and
come
to
the
corner
of
mulberry
street
and
park
lane
you
better
dismiss
your
cab
there
and
wait
for
me
i
sent
word
by
bella
who
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
her
heavy
face
sodden
with
grief
and
taking
my
hat
and
raincoat
it
was
raining
a
light
spring
drizzle
i
hurried
to
the
station
in
minutes
i
was
in
the
city
and
perhaps
twelve
minutes
more
saw
me
at
the
designated
corner
with
my
cab
driving
away
and
the
rain
dropping
off
the
rim
of
my
hat
and
splashing
on
my
shoulders
i
found
a
sort
of
refuge
by
standing
under
the
wooden
arch
of
a
gate
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
for
all
my
years
in
the
city
this
particular
neighborhood
was
altogether
strange
to
me
two
blocks
away
in
any
direction
i
would
have
been
in
familiar
territory
again
back
of
me
a
warehouse
lifted
six
or
seven
gloomy
stories
to
the
sky
the
gate
i
stood
in
was
evidently
the
entrance
to
its
yard
and
in
fact
some
uncomfortable
movement
of
mine
just
then
struck
the
latch
and
almost
precipitated
me
backward
by
its
sudden
opening
beyond
was
a
yard
full
of
shadowy
wheels
and
packing
cases
the
street
lights
did
not
penetrate
there
and
with
an
uneasy
feeling
that
almost
anything
in
this
none
too
savory
neighborhood
might
be
waiting
there
i
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
twenty
minutes
after
ten
once
a
man
turned
the
corner
and
came
toward
me
his
head
down
his
long
ulster
flapping
around
his
legs
confident
that
it
was
hunter
i
stepped
out
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
he
wheeled
instantly
and
in
the
light
which
shone
on
his
face
i
saw
my
error
excuse
me
i
mumbled
i
mistook
my
man
he
went
on
again
without
speaking
only
pulling
his
soft
hat
down
lower
over
his
face
i
looked
after
him
until
he
turned
the
next
corner
and
i
knew
i
had
not
been
mistaken
it
was
wardrop
the
next
minute
hunter
appeared
from
the
same
direction
and
we
walked
quickly
together
i
told
him
who
the
man
just
ahead
had
been
and
he
nodded
without
surprise
but
before
we
turned
the
next
corner
he
stopped
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
white
cat
he
asked
little
political
club
never
i
a
member
of
it
he
went
on
rapidly
it
run
by
the
city
ring
or
rather
it
runs
itself
be
a
good
fellow
while
you
there
and
keep
your
eyes
open
it
a
queer
joint
the
corner
we
turned
found
us
on
a
narrow
badly
paved
street
the
broken
windows
of
the
warehouse
still
looked
down
on
us
and
across
the
street
was
an
ice
factory
with
two
deserted
wagons
standing
along
the
curb
as
well
as
i
could
see
for
the
darkness
a
lumber
yard
stretched
beyond
the
warehouse
its
piles
of
boards
giving
off
in
the
rain
the
aromatic
odor
of
fresh
pine
at
a
gate
in
the
fence
beyond
the
warehouse
hunter
stopped
it
was
an
ordinary
wooden
gate
and
it
opened
with
a
thumb
latch
beyond
stretched
a
long
narrow
alleyway
perhaps
three
feet
wide
and
lighted
by
the
merest
glimmer
of
a
light
ahead
hunter
went
on
regardless
of
puddles
in
the
brick
paving
and
i
stumbled
after
him
as
we
advanced
i
could
see
that
the
light
was
a
single
electric
bulb
hung
over
a
second
gate
while
hunter
fumbled
for
a
key
in
his
pocket
i
had
time
to
see
that
this
gate
had
a
yale
lock
was
provided
at
the
side
with
an
electric
bell
button
and
had
a
letter
slot
cut
in
it
hunter
opened
the
gate
and
preceded
me
through
it
the
gate
swung
to
and
clicked
behind
me
after
the
gloom
of
the
passageway
the
small
yard
seemed
brilliant
with
lights
two
wires
were
strung
its
length
dotted
with
many
electric
lamps
in
a
corner
a
striped
tent
stood
out
in
grotesque
relief
it
seemed
to
be
empty
and
the
weather
was
an
easy
explanation
from
the
house
beyond
there
came
suddenly
a
burst
of
piano
music
and
a
none
too
steady
masculine
voice
hunter
turned
to
me
with
his
foot
on
the
wooden
steps
above
everything
else
he
warned
keep
your
temper
nobody
gives
a
hang
in
here
whether
you
the
mayor
of
the
town
the
champion
of
the
first
ward
or
the
roundsman
on
the
beat
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
was
also
we
stepped
at
once
into
the
kitchen
from
which
i
imagined
that
the
house
faced
on
another
street
and
that
for
obvious
reasons
only
its
rear
entrance
was
used
the
kitchen
was
bright
and
clean
it
was
littered
however
with
loaves
of
bread
glasses
and
empty
bottles
over
the
range
a
man
in
his
shirt
sleeves
was
giving
his
whole
attention
to
a
slice
of
ham
sizzling
on
a
skillet
and
at
a
table
a
young
fellow
with
his
hair
cut
in
a
barber
oval
over
the
back
of
his
neck
was
spreading
slices
of
bread
and
cheese
with
mustard
how
are
you
mr
mayor
hunter
said
as
he
shed
his
raincoat
this
is
knox
the
man
who
engineering
the
fight
the
man
over
the
range
wiped
one
greasy
hand
and
held
it
out
to
me
the
cat
is
purring
a
welcome
he
said
indicating
the
frying
ham
if
my
cooking
turns
out
right
i
ask
you
to
have
some
ham
with
me
i
do
know
why
in
thunder
it
gets
black
in
the
middle
and
wo
cook
around
the
edges
i
recognized
the
mayor
he
was
a
big
fellow
handsome
in
a
heavy
way
and
tommy
to
every
one
who
knew
him
it
seemed
i
was
about
to
see
my
city
government
at
play
hunter
was
thoroughly
at
home
he
took
my
coat
and
his
own
and
hung
them
somewhere
to
dry
then
he
went
into
a
sort
of
pantry
opening
off
the
kitchen
and
came
out
with
four
bottles
of
beer
we
take
care
of
ourselves
here
he
explained
as
the
newly
barbered
youth
washed
some
glasses
if
you
want
a
sandwich
there
is
cooked
ham
in
the
refrigerator
and
cheese
if
our
friend
at
the
sink
has
left
any
the
boy
looked
up
from
his
glasses
it
cheese
that
stuff
he
growled
the
other
ran
out
an
hour
ago
and
did
come
back
put
in
the
mayor
grinning
you
can
kill
that
with
mustard
if
it
too
lively
get
some
cigars
will
you
hunter
asked
me
they
on
a
shelf
in
the
pantry
i
have
my
hands
full
i
went
for
the
cigars
remembering
to
keep
my
eyes
open
the
pantry
was
a
small
room
it
contained
an
stocked
with
drinkables
ham
eggs
and
butter
on
shelves
above
were
cards
cigars
and
liquors
and
there
too
i
saw
a
box
with
an
indorsement
which
showed
the
honor
system
of
the
cat
club
sign
checks
and
drop
here
it
read
and
i
thought
about
the
old
adage
of
honor
among
thieves
and
politicians
when
i
came
out
with
the
cigars
hunter
was
standing
with
a
group
of
new
arrivals
they
included
one
of
the
city
physicians
the
director
of
public
charities
and
a
judge
of
a
local
court
the
latter
mcfeely
a
little
thin
irishman
knew
me
and
accosted
me
at
once
the
mayor
was
busy
over
the
range
and
was
almost
purple
with
heat
and
unwonted
anxiety
when
the
three
went
instead
of
going
into
the
i
looked
at
hunter
is
this
where
the
political
game
is
played
i
asked
yes
if
the
political
game
is
poker
he
replied
and
led
the
way
into
the
room
which
adjoined
the
kitchen
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
us
bare
tables
a
wooden
floor
and
almost
as
many
cuspidors
as
chairs
comprised
the
furniture
of
the
long
room
in
one
corner
was
a
battered
upright
piano
and
there
were
two
fireplaces
with
mantels
perhaps
a
dozen
men
were
sitting
around
talking
loudly
with
much
scraping
of
chairs
on
the
bare
floor
at
one
table
they
were
throwing
poker
dice
but
the
rest
were
drinking
beer
and
talking
in
a
desultory
way
at
the
piano
a
man
with
a
red
mustache
was
mimicking
the
sextette
from
and
a
roar
of
applause
met
us
as
we
entered
the
room
hunter
led
the
way
to
a
corner
and
put
down
his
bottles
it
fairly
quiet
he
said
the
big
night
saturday
what
time
do
they
close
up
i
asked
in
answer
hunter
pointed
to
a
sign
over
the
door
it
was
a
card
neatly
printed
and
it
said
the
white
cat
never
sleeps
there
are
only
two
rules
here
he
explained
that
is
one
and
the
other
is
you
get
too
noisy
and
the
patrol
wagon
comes
make
the
driver
take
you
home
the
crowd
was
it
paid
little
or
no
attention
to
us
and
when
some
one
at
the
piano
began
to
thump
a
waltz
hunter
under
cover
of
the
noise
leaned
over
to
me
we
traced
fleming
here
through
your
and
the
cabby
he
said
carefully
i
have
seen
him
but
it
is
a
moral
certainty
he
is
skulking
in
one
of
the
rooms
his
precious
private
secretary
is
here
too
i
glanced
around
the
room
but
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
us
i
do
know
fleming
by
sight
the
detective
went
on
and
the
pictures
we
have
of
him
were
taken
a
good
while
ago
when
he
wore
a
mustache
when
he
was
in
local
politics
before
he
went
to
the
legislature
he
practically
owned
this
place
paying
for
favors
with
membership
tickets
a
man
could
hide
here
for
a
year
safely
the
police
never
come
here
and
a
man
business
is
his
own
he
is
now
yes
there
are
four
rooms
up
there
for
cards
and
a
it
an
old
dwelling
house
would
fleming
know
you
no
but
of
course
wardrop
would
as
if
in
answer
to
my
objection
wardrop
appeared
at
that
moment
he
ran
down
the
painted
wooden
stairs
and
hurried
through
the
room
without
looking
to
right
or
left
the
piano
kept
on
and
the
men
at
the
tables
were
still
engrossed
with
their
glasses
and
one
another
wardrop
was
very
pale
he
bolted
into
a
man
at
the
door
and
pushed
him
aside
without
ceremony
you
might
go
up
now
hunter
said
rising
i
will
see
where
the
young
gentleman
is
making
for
just
open
the
door
of
the
different
rooms
look
around
for
fleming
and
if
any
one
notices
you
ask
if
al
hunter
is
there
that
will
let
you
out
he
left
me
then
and
after
waiting
perhaps
a
minute
i
went
alone
the
second
floor
was
the
ordinary
upper
story
of
a
small
dwelling
house
the
doors
were
closed
but
loud
talking
smoke
and
the
rattle
of
chips
floated
out
through
open
transoms
from
below
the
noise
of
the
piano
came
up
the
staircase
unmelodious
but
rhythmical
and
from
the
street
on
which
the
house
faced
an
automobile
was
starting
its
engine
with
a
series
of
explosions
the
noise
was
confusing
disconcerting
i
opened
two
doors
to
find
only
the
usual
poker
table
with
the
winners
sitting
quietly
their
cards
bunched
in
the
palms
of
their
hands
and
the
losers
growing
more
voluble
as
the
night
went
on
buying
chips
recklessly
drinking
more
than
they
should
the
atmosphere
was
reeking
with
smoke
the
third
door
i
opened
was
that
of
a
dingy
with
a
zinc
tub
and
a
slovenly
the
next
however
was
different
the
light
streamed
out
through
the
transom
as
in
the
other
rooms
but
there
was
no
noise
from
within
with
my
hand
on
the
door
i
hesitated
then
with
hunter
injunction
ringing
in
my
ears
i
opened
it
and
looked
in
a
breath
of
cool
night
air
from
an
open
window
met
me
there
was
no
noise
no
smoke
no
sour
odor
of
stale
beer
a
table
had
been
drawn
to
the
center
of
the
small
room
and
was
littered
with
papers
pen
and
ink
at
one
corner
was
a
tray
containing
the
remnants
of
a
meal
a
pillow
and
a
pair
of
blankets
on
a
couch
at
one
side
showed
the
room
had
been
serving
as
a
bedchamber
but
none
of
these
things
caught
my
eye
at
first
at
the
table
leaning
forward
his
head
on
his
arms
was
a
man
i
coughed
and
receiving
no
answer
stepped
into
the
room
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
but
i
am
looking
for
then
the
truth
burst
on
me
overwhelmed
me
a
thin
stream
was
spreading
over
the
papers
on
the
table
moving
slowly
sluggishly
as
is
the
way
with
blood
when
the
heart
pump
is
stopped
i
hurried
over
and
raised
the
heavy
wobbling
gray
head
it
was
allan
fleming
and
he
had
been
shot
through
the
forehead
chapter
ix
only
one
eye
closed
my
first
impulse
was
to
rouse
the
house
my
second
to
wait
for
hunter
to
turn
loose
that
mob
of
men
in
such
a
place
seemed
profanation
there
was
nothing
of
the
majesty
or
panoply
of
death
here
but
the
very
sordidness
of
the
surroundings
made
me
resolve
to
guard
the
new
dignity
of
that
figure
i
was
shocked
of
course
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
i
was
emotionally
unstrung
on
the
contrary
i
was
conscious
of
a
distinct
feeling
of
disappointment
fleming
had
been
our
key
to
the
bellwood
affair
and
he
had
put
himself
beyond
helping
to
solve
any
mystery
i
locked
the
door
and
stood
wondering
what
to
do
next
i
should
have
called
a
doctor
no
doubt
but
i
had
seen
enough
of
death
to
know
that
the
man
was
beyond
aid
of
any
kind
it
was
not
until
i
had
bolted
the
door
that
i
discovered
the
absence
of
any
weapon
everything
that
had
gone
before
had
pointed
to
a
position
so
untenable
that
suicide
seemed
its
natural
and
inevitable
result
with
the
discovery
that
there
was
no
revolver
on
the
table
or
floor
the
thing
was
more
ominous
i
decided
at
once
to
call
the
young
city
physician
in
the
room
across
the
hall
and
with
something
approximating
panic
i
threw
open
the
door
to
face
harry
wardrop
and
behind
him
hunter
i
do
not
remember
that
any
one
spoke
hunter
jumped
past
me
into
the
room
and
took
in
in
a
single
glance
what
i
had
labored
to
acquire
in
three
minutes
as
wardrop
came
in
hunter
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
we
three
stood
staring
at
the
prostrate
figure
over
the
table
i
watched
wardrop
i
have
never
seen
so
suddenly
abject
a
picture
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
feeling
for
his
handkerchief
wiped
his
shaking
lips
every
particle
of
color
left
his
face
and
he
was
limp
unnerved
did
you
hear
the
shot
hunter
asked
me
it
has
been
a
matter
of
minutes
since
it
happened
i
do
know
i
said
bewildered
i
heard
a
lot
of
explosions
but
i
thought
it
was
an
automobile
out
in
the
street
hunter
was
listening
while
he
examined
the
room
peering
under
the
table
lifting
the
blankets
that
had
trailed
off
the
couch
on
to
the
floor
some
one
outside
tried
the
and
finding
the
door
locked
shook
it
slightly
fleming
he
called
under
his
breath
fleming
we
were
silent
in
response
to
a
signal
from
hunter
and
the
steps
retreated
heavily
down
the
hall
the
detective
spread
the
blankets
decently
over
the
couch
and
the
three
of
us
moved
the
body
there
wardrop
was
almost
collapsing
now
hunter
said
quietly
before
i
call
in
doctor
gray
from
the
room
across
what
do
you
know
about
this
thing
mr
wardrop
wardrop
looked
dazed
he
was
in
a
bad
way
when
i
left
this
morning
he
said
huskily
there
is
much
use
now
trying
to
hide
anything
god
knows
i
done
all
i
could
but
he
has
been
using
cocaine
for
years
and
he
ran
out
of
the
stuff
when
i
got
here
about
half
an
hour
ago
he
was
on
the
verge
of
killing
himself
i
got
the
revolver
from
him
he
was
like
a
crazy
man
and
as
soon
as
i
dared
to
leave
him
i
went
out
to
try
and
find
a
doctor
to
get
some
cocaine
yes
not
because
he
was
already
wounded
and
you
were
afraid
it
was
fatal
wardrop
shuddered
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
his
tone
was
more
natural
what
the
use
of
lying
about
it
he
said
wearily
you
wo
believe
me
if
i
tell
the
truth
either
but
he
was
dead
when
i
got
here
i
heard
something
like
the
bang
of
a
door
as
i
went
but
the
noise
was
terrific
down
below
and
i
could
tell
when
i
went
in
he
was
just
dropping
forward
and
he
hesitated
the
revolver
hunter
queried
was
in
his
hand
he
was
dead
then
where
is
the
revolver
i
will
turn
it
over
to
the
coroner
you
will
give
it
to
me
hunter
replied
sharply
and
after
a
little
fumbling
wardrop
produced
it
from
his
hip
pocket
it
was
an
ordinary
the
detective
opened
it
and
glanced
at
it
two
chambers
were
empty
and
you
waited
say
ten
minutes
before
you
called
for
help
and
even
then
you
went
outside
hunting
a
doctor
what
were
you
doing
in
those
ten
minutes
wardrop
shut
his
lips
and
refused
to
reply
if
fleming
shot
himself
the
detective
pursued
relentlessly
there
would
be
powder
marks
around
the
wound
then
too
he
was
in
the
act
of
writing
a
letter
it
was
a
strange
impulse
this
you
see
he
had
only
written
a
dozen
words
i
glanced
at
the
paper
on
the
table
the
letter
had
no
superscription
it
began
abruptly
i
shall
have
to
leave
here
the
numbers
have
followed
me
that
was
all
this
is
not
suicide
hunter
said
gravely
it
is
murder
and
i
warn
you
wardrop
to
be
careful
what
you
say
will
you
ask
doctor
gray
to
come
in
mr
knox
i
went
across
the
hall
to
the
room
where
the
noise
was
loudest
fortunately
doctor
gray
was
out
of
the
game
he
was
opening
a
can
of
caviar
at
a
table
in
the
corner
and
came
out
in
response
to
a
gesture
he
did
not
ask
any
questions
and
i
let
him
go
into
the
death
chamber
unprepared
the
presence
of
death
apparently
had
no
effect
on
him
but
the
identity
of
the
dead
man
almost
stupefied
him
fleming
he
said
awed
as
he
looked
down
at
the
body
fleming
by
all
that
sacred
and
a
suicide
hunter
watched
him
grimly
how
long
has
he
been
dead
he
asked
the
doctor
glanced
at
the
bullet
wound
in
the
forehead
and
from
there
significantly
to
the
group
around
the
couch
not
an
hour
probably
less
than
half
he
said
it
strange
we
heard
nothing
across
the
hall
there
hunter
took
a
clean
folded
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
opening
it
laid
it
gently
over
the
dead
face
i
think
it
was
a
relief
to
all
of
us
the
doctor
got
up
from
his
kneeling
posture
beside
the
couch
and
looked
at
hunter
inquiringly
what
about
getting
him
away
from
here
he
said
there
is
sure
to
be
a
lot
of
noise
about
it
and
you
remember
what
happened
when
butler
killed
himself
here
he
was
reported
as
being
found
dead
in
the
lumber
yard
hunter
said
dryly
well
doctor
this
body
stays
where
it
is
and
i
do
give
a
whoop
if
the
whole
city
government
wants
it
moved
it
wo
be
this
is
murder
not
suicide
the
doctor
expression
was
curious
murder
he
repeated
why
who
but
hunter
had
many
things
to
attend
to
he
broke
in
ruthlessly
on
the
doctor
amazement
see
if
you
can
get
the
house
empty
doctor
just
tell
them
he
is
dead
the
story
will
get
out
soon
enough
as
the
doctor
left
the
room
hunter
went
to
the
open
window
through
which
a
fresh
burst
of
rain
was
coming
and
closed
it
the
window
gave
me
an
idea
and
i
went
over
and
tried
to
see
through
the
streaming
pane
there
was
no
shed
or
low
building
outside
but
not
five
yards
away
the
warehouse
showed
its
ugly
walls
and
broken
windows
look
here
hunter
i
said
why
could
he
not
have
been
shot
from
the
warehouse
he
could
have
been
but
he
was
hunter
affirmed
glancing
at
wardrop
drooping
figure
wardrop
i
am
going
to
send
for
the
coroner
and
then
i
shall
ask
you
to
go
with
me
to
the
office
and
tell
the
chief
what
you
know
about
this
knox
will
you
telephone
to
the
coroner
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
was
emptied
and
before
midnight
the
coroner
himself
arrived
and
went
up
to
the
room
as
for
me
i
had
breakfasted
lunched
and
dined
on
horrors
and
i
sat
in
the
deserted
room
and
tried
to
think
how
i
was
to
take
the
news
to
margery
at
wardrop
hunter
and
the
coroner
came
leaving
a
detective
in
charge
of
the
body
until
morning
when
it
could
be
taken
home
the
coroner
had
a
cab
waiting
and
he
took
us
at
once
to
hunter
chief
he
had
not
gone
to
bed
and
we
filed
into
his
library
sepulchrally
wardrop
told
his
story
but
it
was
hardly
convincing
the
chief
a
large
man
who
said
very
little
and
leaned
back
with
his
eyes
partly
shut
listened
in
silence
only
occasionally
asking
a
question
the
coroner
who
was
yawning
steadily
left
in
the
middle
of
wardrop
story
as
if
in
his
mind
at
least
the
guilty
man
was
as
good
as
hanged
i
am
i
was
allan
fleming
private
secretary
wardrop
began
i
secured
the
position
through
a
relationship
on
his
wife
side
i
have
held
the
position
for
three
years
before
that
i
read
law
for
some
time
i
have
known
that
fleming
used
a
drug
of
some
kind
until
a
week
ago
i
did
not
know
what
it
was
on
the
ninth
of
may
fleming
sent
for
me
i
was
in
plattsburg
at
the
time
and
he
was
at
home
he
was
in
a
terrible
condition
not
sleeping
at
all
and
he
said
he
was
being
followed
by
some
person
who
meant
to
kill
him
finally
he
asked
me
to
get
him
some
cocaine
and
when
he
had
taken
it
he
was
more
like
himself
i
thought
the
pursuit
was
only
in
his
own
head
he
had
a
man
named
carter
on
guard
in
his
house
and
acting
as
butler
there
was
trouble
of
some
sort
in
the
organization
i
do
not
know
just
what
schwartz
came
here
to
meet
fleming
and
it
seemed
there
was
money
needed
fleming
had
to
have
it
at
once
he
gave
me
some
securities
to
take
to
plattsburg
and
turn
into
money
i
went
on
the
tenth
was
that
the
day
fleming
disappeared
the
chief
interrupted
yes
he
went
to
the
white
cat
and
stayed
there
no
one
but
the
caretaker
and
one
other
man
knew
he
was
there
on
the
night
of
the
i
came
back
having
turned
my
securities
into
money
i
carried
it
in
a
package
in
a
small
russia
leather
bag
that
never
left
my
hand
for
a
moment
knox
here
suggested
that
i
had
put
it
down
and
it
had
been
exchanged
for
one
just
like
it
but
i
did
not
let
it
out
of
my
hand
on
that
journey
until
i
put
it
down
on
the
porch
at
the
bellwood
house
while
i
tried
to
get
in
i
live
at
bellwood
with
the
misses
maitland
sisters
of
fleming
deceased
wife
i
do
pretend
to
know
how
it
happened
but
while
i
was
trying
to
get
into
the
house
it
was
rifled
knox
will
bear
me
out
in
that
i
found
my
grip
empty
i
affirmed
it
in
a
word
the
chief
was
growing
interested
what
was
in
the
bag
he
asked
wardrop
tried
to
remember
a
pair
of
pajamas
he
said
two
military
brushes
and
a
two
or
three
shirts
perhaps
a
collars
and
a
suit
of
underwear
and
all
this
was
taken
as
well
as
the
money
the
bag
was
left
empty
except
for
my
railroad
schedule
the
chief
and
hunter
exchanged
significant
glances
then
go
on
if
you
please
the
detective
said
cheerfully
i
think
wardrop
realized
the
absurdity
of
trying
to
make
any
one
believe
that
part
of
the
story
he
shut
his
lips
and
threw
up
his
head
as
if
he
intended
to
say
nothing
further
go
on
i
urged
if
he
could
clear
himself
he
must
i
could
not
go
back
to
margery
fleming
and
tell
her
that
her
father
had
been
murdered
and
her
lover
was
accused
of
the
crime
the
bag
was
empty
he
repeated
i
had
not
been
five
minutes
trying
to
open
the
shutters
and
yet
the
bag
had
been
rifled
knox
here
found
it
among
the
flowers
below
the
veranda
empty
the
chief
eyed
me
with
awakened
interest
you
also
live
at
bellwood
mr
knox
no
i
am
attorney
to
miss
letitia
maitland
and
was
there
one
night
as
her
guest
i
found
the
bag
as
wardrop
described
empty
the
chief
turned
back
to
wardrop
how
much
money
was
there
in
it
when
you
left
it
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
was
afraid
to
tell
fleming
but
i
had
to
do
it
we
had
a
stormy
scene
this
morning
i
think
he
thought
the
natural
thing
that
i
had
taken
it
he
struck
you
i
believe
and
knocked
you
down
asked
hunter
smoothly
wardrop
flushed
he
was
not
himself
and
well
it
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
and
he
was
out
of
cocaine
i
left
him
raging
and
when
i
went
home
i
learned
that
miss
jane
maitland
had
disappeared
been
abducted
at
the
time
my
satchel
had
been
emptied
it
no
wonder
i
question
my
sanity
and
then
the
chief
persisted
i
felt
that
some
one
would
have
to
look
after
fleming
i
was
afraid
he
would
kill
himself
it
was
a
bad
time
to
leave
while
miss
jane
was
missing
but
when
i
got
to
the
white
cat
i
found
him
dead
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
his
head
on
the
table
was
the
revolver
in
his
hand
yes
you
are
sure
from
hunter
is
it
a
fact
wardrop
that
you
took
fleming
revolver
from
him
this
morning
when
he
threatened
you
with
it
wardrop
face
twitched
nervously
you
have
been
misinformed
he
replied
but
no
one
was
impressed
by
his
tone
it
was
wavering
uncertain
from
hunter
face
i
judged
it
had
been
a
random
shot
and
had
landed
unexpectedly
well
how
many
people
knew
that
fleming
had
been
hiding
at
the
white
cat
from
the
chief
very
few
besides
myself
only
a
man
who
looks
after
the
in
the
mornings
and
clarkson
the
cashier
of
the
borough
bank
who
met
him
there
once
by
appointment
the
chief
made
no
comment
now
knox
what
about
you
i
opened
the
door
into
fleming
room
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
after
wardrop
went
out
i
said
he
was
dead
then
leaning
on
his
outspread
arms
over
the
table
he
had
been
shot
in
the
forehead
you
heard
no
shot
while
you
were
in
the
hall
there
was
considerable
noise
i
heard
two
or
three
sharp
reports
like
the
explosions
of
an
automobile
engine
did
they
seem
close
at
hand
not
particularly
i
thought
if
i
thought
at
all
that
they
were
on
the
street
you
are
right
about
the
automobile
hunter
said
dryly
the
mayor
sent
his
car
away
as
i
left
to
follow
wardrop
the
sounds
you
heard
were
not
shots
it
is
a
strange
thing
the
chief
reflected
that
a
revolver
could
be
fired
in
the
upper
room
of
an
ordinary
dwelling
house
while
that
house
was
filled
with
people
and
nobody
hear
it
were
there
any
powder
marks
on
the
body
none
hunter
said
the
chief
got
up
stiffly
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen
he
spoke
quietly
i
think
that
is
all
hunter
i
would
like
to
see
you
for
a
few
minutes
i
think
wardrop
was
dazed
at
finding
himself
free
he
had
expected
nothing
less
than
an
immediate
charge
of
murder
as
we
walked
to
the
corner
for
a
car
or
cab
whichever
materialized
first
he
looked
back
i
thought
so
he
said
bitterly
a
man
was
loitering
after
us
along
the
street
the
police
were
not
asleep
they
had
only
closed
one
eye
the
last
train
had
gone
we
took
a
night
electric
car
to
wynton
and
walked
the
three
miles
to
bellwood
neither
of
us
was
talkative
and
i
imagine
we
were
both
thinking
of
margery
and
the
news
she
would
have
to
hear
it
had
been
raining
and
the
roads
were
vile
once
wardrop
turned
around
to
where
we
could
hear
the
detective
splashing
along
well
behind
i
hope
he
enjoying
it
he
said
i
brought
you
by
this
road
so
have
to
wade
in
mud
up
to
his
neck
the
devil
you
did
i
exclaimed
i
have
to
be
scraped
with
a
knife
before
i
can
get
my
clothes
off
we
both
felt
better
for
the
laugh
it
was
a
sort
of
nervous
reaction
the
detective
was
well
behind
but
after
a
while
wardrop
stood
still
while
i
plowed
along
they
came
up
together
presently
and
the
three
of
us
trudged
on
talking
of
immaterial
things
at
the
door
wardrop
turned
to
the
detective
with
a
faint
smile
raining
again
he
said
you
better
come
in
you
need
worry
about
me
i
not
going
to
run
away
and
there
a
couch
in
the
library
the
detective
grinned
and
in
the
light
from
the
hall
i
recognized
the
man
i
had
followed
to
the
police
station
two
nights
before
i
guess
i
will
he
said
looking
apologetically
at
his
muddy
clothes
this
thing
is
only
a
matter
of
form
anyhow
but
he
did
lie
down
on
the
couch
he
took
a
chair
in
the
hall
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
we
left
him
there
with
the
evening
paper
and
a
lamp
it
was
a
queer
situation
to
say
the
least
chapter
x
breaking
the
news
wardrop
looked
so
wretched
that
i
asked
him
into
my
room
and
mixed
him
some
whisky
and
water
when
i
had
given
him
a
cigar
he
began
to
look
a
little
less
hopeless
you
been
a
darned
sight
better
to
me
than
i
would
have
been
to
you
under
the
circumstances
he
said
gratefully
i
thought
we
would
better
arrange
about
miss
margery
before
we
try
to
settle
down
i
replied
what
she
has
gone
through
in
the
last
hours
is
nothing
to
what
is
coming
will
you
tell
her
about
her
father
he
took
a
turn
about
the
room
i
believe
it
would
come
better
from
you
he
said
finally
i
am
in
the
peculiar
position
of
having
been
suspected
by
her
father
of
robbing
him
by
you
of
carrying
away
her
aunt
and
now
by
the
police
and
everybody
else
of
murdering
her
father
i
do
not
suspect
you
of
anything
i
justified
myself
i
do
think
you
are
entirely
open
that
is
all
wardrop
i
think
you
are
damaging
yourself
to
shield
some
one
else
his
expressive
face
was
on
its
guard
in
a
moment
he
ceased
his
restless
pacing
pausing
impressively
before
me
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
gentleman
i
do
not
know
who
killed
fleming
and
that
when
i
first
saw
him
dead
my
only
thought
was
that
he
had
killed
himself
he
had
threatened
to
that
day
why
if
you
think
i
killed
him
you
would
have
to
think
i
robbed
him
too
in
order
to
find
a
motive
i
did
not
tell
him
that
that
was
precisely
what
hunter
think
i
evaded
the
issue
wardrop
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
figures
eleven
i
inquired
eleven
he
repeated
no
never
in
any
unusual
connection
you
never
heard
fleming
use
them
i
persisted
he
looked
puzzled
probably
he
said
in
the
very
nature
of
fleming
position
we
used
figures
all
the
time
eleven
that
the
time
the
theater
train
leaves
the
city
for
bellwood
not
what
you
want
eh
not
quite
i
answered
and
began
to
wind
my
watch
he
took
the
hint
and
prepared
to
leave
i
not
keep
you
up
any
longer
he
said
picking
up
his
raincoat
he
opened
the
door
and
stared
ruefully
down
at
the
detective
in
the
hall
below
the
old
place
is
queer
without
miss
jane
he
said
irrelevantly
well
good
night
and
thanks
he
went
heavily
along
the
hall
and
i
closed
my
door
i
heard
him
pass
margery
room
and
then
go
back
and
rap
lightly
she
was
evidently
awake
it
harry
he
called
i
thought
you
would
worry
if
you
knew
i
was
in
the
house
she
asked
him
something
for
yes
he
is
here
he
said
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
hesitating
over
something
but
whatever
it
was
he
decided
against
it
good
night
dear
he
said
gently
and
went
away
the
little
familiarity
made
me
wince
every
unattached
man
has
the
same
pang
now
and
then
i
have
it
sometimes
when
edith
sits
on
the
arm
of
fred
chair
or
one
of
the
youngsters
leaves
me
to
run
to
daddy
and
one
of
the
sanest
men
i
ever
met
went
to
his
office
and
proposed
to
his
stenographer
in
sheer
craving
for
domesticity
after
watching
the
wife
of
one
of
his
friends
run
her
hand
over
her
husband
chin
and
give
him
a
reproving
slap
for
not
having
shaved
i
pulled
myself
up
sharply
and
after
taking
off
my
dripping
coat
i
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
may
night
it
seemed
incredible
that
almost
the
same
hour
the
previous
night
little
miss
jane
had
disappeared
had
been
taken
bodily
away
through
the
peace
of
the
warm
spring
darkness
and
that
i
as
as
i
was
at
that
moment
acute
enough
of
hearing
to
detect
wardrop
careful
steps
on
the
gravel
walk
below
had
heard
no
struggle
had
permitted
this
thing
to
happen
without
raising
a
finger
in
the
old
lady
defense
and
she
was
gone
as
completely
as
if
she
had
stepped
over
some
psychic
barrier
into
the
fourth
dimension
i
found
myself
avoiding
the
more
recent
occurrence
at
the
white
cat
i
was
still
too
close
to
it
to
have
gained
any
perspective
on
that
subject
i
was
able
to
think
clearly
of
only
one
thing
that
i
would
have
to
tell
margery
in
the
morning
and
that
i
would
have
given
anything
i
possessed
for
a
little
of
edith
diplomacy
with
which
to
break
the
bad
news
it
was
edith
who
broke
the
news
to
me
that
the
moths
had
got
into
my
evening
clothes
while
i
was
hunting
in
the
rockies
by
telling
me
that
my
made
me
look
narrow
across
the
shoulders
and
persuading
me
to
buy
a
new
one
and
give
the
old
one
to
fred
then
she
broke
the
news
of
the
moths
to
fred
i
was
ready
for
bed
when
wardrop
came
back
and
rapped
at
my
door
he
was
still
dressed
and
he
had
the
leather
bag
in
his
hand
look
here
he
said
excitedly
when
i
had
closed
the
door
this
is
not
my
bag
at
all
fool
that
i
was
i
never
examined
it
carefully
he
held
it
out
to
me
and
i
carried
it
to
the
light
it
was
an
ordinary
russia
leather
tan
in
color
and
with
mountings
it
was
empty
save
for
the
railroad
schedule
that
still
rested
in
one
side
pocket
wardrop
pointed
to
the
empty
pocket
on
the
other
side
in
my
bag
he
explained
rapidly
my
name
was
written
inside
that
pocket
in
ink
i
did
it
myself
my
name
and
address
i
looked
inside
the
pockets
on
both
sides
nothing
had
been
written
in
do
you
see
he
asked
excitedly
whoever
stole
my
bag
had
this
one
to
substitute
for
it
if
we
can
succeed
in
tracing
the
bag
here
to
the
shop
it
came
from
and
from
there
to
the
purchaser
we
have
the
thief
there
no
maker
name
in
it
i
said
after
a
casual
examination
wardrop
face
fell
and
he
took
the
bag
from
me
despondently
no
matter
which
way
i
turn
he
said
i
run
into
a
blind
alley
if
i
were
worth
a
damn
i
suppose
i
could
find
a
way
out
but
i
not
well
i
let
you
sleep
this
time
at
the
door
however
he
turned
around
and
put
the
bag
on
the
floor
just
inside
if
you
do
mind
i
leave
it
here
he
said
they
be
searching
my
room
i
suppose
and
i
like
to
have
the
bag
for
future
reference
he
went
for
good
that
time
and
i
put
out
the
light
as
an
afterthought
i
opened
my
door
perhaps
six
inches
and
secured
it
with
one
of
the
pink
which
flanked
either
end
of
the
stone
hearth
i
had
failed
the
night
before
i
meant
to
be
on
hand
that
night
i
went
to
sleep
immediately
i
believe
i
have
no
idea
how
much
later
it
was
that
i
roused
i
wakened
suddenly
and
sat
up
in
bed
there
had
been
a
crash
of
some
kind
for
the
shock
was
still
vibrating
along
my
nerves
dawn
was
close
the
window
showed
gray
against
the
darkness
inside
and
i
could
make
out
dimly
the
larger
objects
in
the
room
i
listened
intently
but
the
house
seemed
quiet
still
i
was
not
satisfied
i
got
up
and
lighting
the
candle
got
into
my
raincoat
in
lieu
of
a
and
prepared
to
investigate
with
the
fatality
that
seemed
to
pursue
my
feet
in
that
house
with
my
first
step
i
trod
squarely
on
top
of
the
and
i
fell
back
on
to
the
edge
of
the
bed
swearing
softly
and
holding
the
injured
member
only
when
the
pain
began
to
subside
did
i
realize
that
i
had
left
the
shell
on
the
and
that
it
had
moved
at
least
eight
feet
while
i
slept
when
i
could
walk
i
put
it
on
the
mantel
its
mate
from
the
other
end
of
the
hearth
beside
it
then
i
took
my
candle
and
went
out
into
the
hall
my
door
which
i
had
left
open
i
found
closed
nothing
else
was
disturbed
the
leather
bag
sat
just
inside
as
wardrop
had
left
it
through
miss
maitland
transom
were
coming
certain
strangled
and
irregular
sounds
now
falsetto
now
deep
bass
that
showed
that
worthy
lady
to
be
asleep
a
glance
down
the
staircase
revealed
davidson
stretching
in
his
chair
and
looking
up
at
me
i
frozen
he
called
up
cautiously
throw
me
down
a
blanket
or
two
will
you
i
got
a
couple
of
blankets
from
my
bed
and
took
them
down
he
was
examining
his
chair
ruefully
there
is
any
grip
to
this
horsehair
stuff
he
complained
every
time
i
doze
off
i
dream
i
coasting
down
the
old
hill
back
on
the
farm
and
when
i
wake
up
i
sitting
on
the
floor
with
the
end
of
my
back
bone
bent
like
a
hook
he
wrapped
himself
in
the
blankets
and
sat
down
again
taking
the
precaution
this
time
to
put
his
legs
on
another
chair
and
thus
anchor
himself
then
he
produced
a
couple
of
apples
and
a
penknife
and
proceeded
to
pare
and
offer
me
one
found
in
the
pantry
he
said
biting
into
one
i
belong
to
the
apple
society
eat
one
apple
every
day
and
keep
healthy
he
stopped
and
stared
intently
at
the
apple
i
reckon
i
got
a
worm
that
time
he
said
with
less
ardor
i
get
something
to
wash
him
down
i
offered
rising
but
he
waved
me
back
to
my
stair
not
on
your
life
he
said
with
dignity
let
him
walk
how
are
things
going
you
did
happen
to
be
up
there
a
little
while
ago
did
you
i
questioned
in
turn
no
i
been
kept
busy
trying
to
sit
tight
where
i
am
why
some
one
came
into
my
room
and
wakened
me
i
explained
i
heard
a
racket
and
when
i
got
up
i
found
a
shell
that
i
had
put
on
the
to
keep
the
door
open
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
stepped
on
it
he
examined
a
piece
of
apple
before
putting
it
in
his
mouth
then
he
turned
a
pair
of
shrewd
eyes
on
me
that
funny
he
said
anything
in
the
room
disturbed
nothing
where
the
shell
now
on
the
mantel
i
did
want
to
step
on
it
again
he
thought
for
a
minute
but
his
next
remark
was
wholly
facetious
no
i
guess
you
wo
step
on
it
up
there
like
the
old
woman
she
says
if
i
put
my
foot
on
the
rail
will
i
be
electrocuted
and
he
says
madam
not
unless
you
put
your
other
foot
on
the
trolley
wire
i
got
up
impatiently
there
was
no
humor
in
the
situation
that
night
for
me
some
one
had
been
in
the
room
i
reiterated
the
door
was
closed
although
i
had
left
it
open
he
finished
his
apple
and
proceeded
with
great
gravity
to
drop
the
parings
down
the
immaculate
register
in
the
floor
beside
his
chair
then
i
only
got
one
business
here
knox
he
said
in
an
undertone
and
you
know
what
that
is
but
if
it
will
relieve
your
mind
of
the
thought
that
there
was
anything
supernatural
about
your
visitor
tell
you
that
it
was
wardrop
and
that
to
the
best
of
my
belief
he
was
in
your
room
not
once
but
twice
in
the
last
hour
and
a
half
as
far
as
that
shell
goes
it
was
i
that
kicked
it
having
gone
up
without
my
shoes
i
stared
at
him
blankly
what
could
he
have
wanted
i
exclaimed
but
with
his
revelation
davidson
interest
ceased
he
drew
the
blanket
up
around
his
shoulders
and
shivered
search
me
he
said
and
yawned
i
went
back
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
i
deliberately
left
the
door
wide
open
but
no
intrusion
occurred
once
i
got
up
and
glanced
down
the
stairs
for
all
his
apparent
drowsiness
davidson
heard
my
cautious
movements
and
saluted
me
in
a
husky
whisper
have
you
got
any
quinine
he
said
i
sneezing
my
head
off
but
i
had
none
i
gave
him
a
box
of
cigarettes
and
after
partially
dressing
i
threw
myself
across
the
bed
to
wait
for
daylight
i
was
roused
by
the
sun
beating
on
my
face
to
hear
miss
letitia
tones
from
her
room
across
nonsense
she
was
saying
querulously
do
you
suppose
i
can
smell
do
you
think
because
i
a
little
hard
of
hearing
that
i
lost
my
other
senses
somebody
been
smoking
it
me
heppie
shouted
i
you
miss
letitia
snarled
what
are
you
smoking
for
that
ai
my
shirt
it
my
i
ai
smokin
yelled
heppie
you
wo
let
me
tell
you
i
spilled
vinegar
on
the
stove
that
what
you
smell
miss
letitia
sardonic
chuckle
came
through
the
door
vinegar
she
said
with
scorn
next
thing
you
be
telling
me
vinegar
that
harry
and
knox
carry
around
in
little
boxes
in
their
pockets
you
pinned
my
cap
to
my
scalp
i
hurried
to
find
davidson
gone
my
blanket
lay
neatly
folded
on
the
lower
step
and
the
horsehair
chairs
were
ranged
along
the
wall
as
before
i
looked
around
anxiously
for
telltale
ashes
but
there
was
none
save
at
the
edge
of
the
spotless
register
a
trace
evidently
they
had
followed
the
apple
parings
it
grew
cold
a
day
or
so
later
and
miss
letitia
had
the
furnace
fired
and
although
it
does
not
belong
to
my
story
she
and
heppie
searched
the
house
over
to
account
for
the
odor
of
baking
apples
a
mystery
that
was
never
explained
wardrop
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
margery
came
as
bella
was
bringing
me
my
coffee
and
dropped
languidly
into
her
chair
she
looked
tired
and
white
another
day
she
said
wearily
did
you
ever
live
through
such
an
eternity
as
the
last
hours
i
responded
absently
the
duty
i
had
assumed
hung
heavy
over
me
i
had
a
frantic
impulse
to
shirk
the
whole
thing
to
go
to
wardrop
and
tell
him
it
was
his
responsibility
not
mine
to
make
this
girl
sadder
still
that
as
i
had
not
his
privilege
of
comforting
her
neither
should
i
shoulder
his
responsibility
of
telling
her
but
the
issue
was
forced
on
me
sooner
than
i
had
expected
for
at
that
moment
i
saw
the
glaring
of
the
morning
paper
laid
open
at
wardrop
plate
she
must
have
followed
my
eyes
for
we
reached
for
it
simultaneously
she
was
nearer
than
i
and
her
quick
eye
caught
the
name
then
i
put
my
hand
over
the
heading
and
she
flushed
with
indignation
you
are
not
to
read
it
now
i
said
meeting
her
astonished
gaze
as
best
i
could
please
let
me
have
it
i
promise
you
i
will
give
it
to
you
almost
immediately
you
are
very
rude
she
said
without
relinquishing
the
paper
i
saw
a
part
of
that
it
is
about
my
father
drink
your
coffee
please
i
pleaded
i
will
let
you
read
it
then
on
my
honor
she
looked
at
me
then
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
sat
erect
how
can
you
be
so
childish
she
exclaimed
if
there
is
anything
in
that
paper
that
it
will
hurt
me
to
learn
is
a
cup
of
coffee
going
to
make
it
any
easier
i
gave
up
then
i
had
always
thought
that
people
heard
bad
news
better
when
they
had
been
fortified
with
something
to
eat
and
i
had
a
very
distinct
recollection
that
fred
had
made
edith
drink
something
tea
probably
before
he
told
her
that
billy
had
fallen
off
the
back
fence
and
would
have
to
have
a
stitch
taken
in
his
lip
perhaps
i
should
have
offered
margery
tea
instead
of
coffee
but
as
it
was
she
sat
stonily
erect
staring
at
the
paper
and
feeling
that
evasion
would
be
useless
i
told
her
what
had
happened
breaking
the
news
as
gently
as
i
could
i
stood
by
her
helplessly
through
the
tearless
agony
that
followed
and
cursed
myself
for
a
blundering
ass
i
had
said
that
he
had
been
accidentally
shot
and
i
said
it
with
the
paper
behind
me
but
she
put
the
evasion
aside
bitterly
accidentally
she
repeated
the
first
storm
of
grief
over
she
lifted
her
head
from
where
it
had
rested
on
her
arms
and
looked
at
me
scorning
my
subterfuge
he
was
murdered
that
the
word
i
did
have
time
to
read
murdered
and
you
sat
back
and
let
it
happen
i
went
to
you
in
time
and
you
did
do
anything
no
one
did
anything
i
did
not
try
to
defend
myself
how
could
i
and
afterward
when
she
sat
up
and
pushed
back
the
damp
strands
of
hair
from
her
eyes
she
was
more
reasonable
i
did
not
mean
what
i
said
about
your
not
having
done
anything
she
said
almost
childishly
no
one
could
have
done
more
it
was
to
happen
that
all
but
even
then
i
knew
she
had
trouble
in
store
that
she
did
not
suspect
what
would
she
do
when
she
heard
that
wardrop
was
under
grave
suspicion
between
her
dead
father
and
her
lover
what
it
was
to
be
days
before
i
knew
and
in
all
that
time
i
who
would
have
died
not
cheerfully
but
at
least
stoically
for
her
had
to
stand
back
and
watch
the
struggle
not
daring
to
hold
out
my
hand
to
help
lest
by
the
very
gesture
she
divine
my
wild
longing
to
hold
her
for
myself
she
recovered
bravely
that
morning
from
the
shock
and
refusing
to
go
to
her
room
and
lie
down
a
suggestion
like
the
coffee
culled
from
my
vicarious
domestic
life
she
went
out
to
the
veranda
and
sat
there
in
the
morning
sun
gazing
across
the
lawn
i
left
her
there
finally
and
broke
the
news
of
her
death
to
miss
letitia
after
the
first
surprise
the
old
lady
took
the
news
with
what
was
nearer
complacency
than
resignation
shot
she
said
sitting
up
in
bed
while
heppie
shook
her
pillows
it
a
queer
death
for
allan
fleming
i
always
said
he
would
be
hanged
after
that
she
apparently
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
and
we
talked
of
her
sister
her
mood
had
changed
and
it
was
depressing
to
find
that
she
spoke
of
jane
always
in
the
past
tense
she
could
speak
of
her
quite
calmly
i
suppose
the
sharpness
of
our
emotions
is
in
inverse
ratio
to
our
length
of
years
and
she
regretted
that
under
the
circumstances
jane
would
not
rest
in
the
family
lot
we
are
all
there
she
said
eleven
of
us
counting
my
sister
husband
although
he
do
properly
belong
and
i
always
said
we
would
take
him
out
if
we
were
crowded
it
is
the
best
lot
in
the
hopedale
cemetery
you
can
see
the
shaft
for
two
miles
in
any
direction
we
held
a
family
council
that
morning
around
miss
letitia
bed
wardrop
who
took
little
part
in
the
proceedings
and
who
stood
at
a
window
looking
out
most
of
the
time
margery
on
the
bed
her
arm
around
miss
letitia
shriveled
neck
and
heppie
who
acted
as
interpreter
and
shouted
into
the
old
lady
ear
such
parts
of
the
conversation
as
she
considered
essential
i
have
talked
with
miss
fleming
i
said
as
clearly
as
i
could
and
she
seems
to
shrink
from
seeing
people
the
only
friends
she
cares
about
are
in
europe
and
she
tells
me
there
are
no
other
relatives
heppie
condensed
this
into
a
vocal
capsule
and
thrust
it
into
miss
letitia
ear
the
old
lady
nodded
no
other
relatives
she
corroborated
god
be
praised
for
that
anyhow
and
yet
i
went
on
there
are
things
to
look
after
certain
necessary
duties
that
no
one
else
can
attend
to
i
do
want
to
insist
but
she
ought
if
she
is
able
to
go
to
the
city
house
for
a
few
hours
at
least
city
house
heppie
yelled
in
her
ear
it
ought
to
be
cleaned
miss
letitia
acquiesced
and
fresh
curtains
put
up
jane
would
have
been
in
her
element
she
was
always
handy
at
a
funeral
and
do
let
them
get
one
of
those
coffins
they
leaky
luckily
margery
did
not
notice
this
i
was
going
to
suggest
i
put
in
hurriedly
that
my
brother
wife
would
be
only
too
glad
to
help
and
if
miss
fleming
will
go
into
town
with
me
i
am
sure
edith
would
know
just
what
to
do
she
is
curious
and
she
very
capable
margery
threw
me
a
grateful
glance
grateful
i
think
that
i
could
understand
how
under
the
circumstances
a
stranger
was
more
acceptable
than
curious
friends
could
be
knox
interpreted
heppie
when
you
have
to
say
the
letter
turn
your
head
away
miss
letitia
rebuked
her
well
i
do
object
if
knox
do
she
had
an
uncanny
way
of
expanding
heppie
tabloid
speeches
you
can
take
my
white
silk
shawl
to
lay
over
the
body
but
be
sure
to
bring
it
back
we
may
need
it
for
jane
if
the
old
lady
chin
quivered
a
bit
while
margery
threw
her
arms
around
her
she
was
mightily
ashamed
of
it
but
heppie
was
made
of
weaker
stuff
she
broke
into
a
sudden
storm
of
sobs
and
left
the
room
to
stick
her
head
in
the
door
a
moment
after
kidneys
or
chops
she
shouted
almost
belligerently
kidneys
miss
letitia
replied
in
kind
wardrop
went
with
us
to
the
station
at
noon
but
he
left
us
there
with
a
brief
remark
that
he
would
be
up
that
night
after
i
had
put
margery
in
a
seat
i
went
back
to
have
a
word
with
him
alone
he
was
standing
beside
the
train
trying
to
light
a
cigarette
but
his
hands
shook
almost
beyond
control
and
after
the
fourth
match
he
gave
it
up
my
minute
for
speech
was
gone
as
the
train
moved
out
i
saw
him
walking
back
along
the
platform
paying
no
attention
to
anything
around
him
also
i
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
man
loafing
on
a
baggage
truck
his
hat
over
his
eyes
he
was
paring
an
apple
with
a
penknife
and
dropping
the
peelings
with
careful
accuracy
through
a
crack
in
the
floor
of
the
platform
i
had
arranged
over
the
telephone
that
edith
should
meet
the
train
and
it
was
a
relief
to
see
that
she
and
margery
took
to
each
other
at
once
we
drove
to
the
house
immediately
and
after
a
few
tears
when
she
saw
the
familiar
things
around
her
margery
rose
to
the
situation
bravely
miss
letitia
had
sent
bella
to
put
the
house
in
order
and
it
was
evident
that
the
idea
of
clean
curtains
for
the
funeral
had
been
drilled
into
her
until
it
had
become
an
obsession
not
until
edith
had
concealed
the
were
the
hangings
safe
and
late
in
the
afternoon
we
heard
a
crash
from
the
library
and
found
bella
twisted
on
the
floor
the
result
of
putting
a
teakwood
tabouret
on
a
table
and
from
thence
attacking
the
lace
curtains
of
the
library
windows
edith
gave
her
a
good
scolding
and
sent
her
off
to
soak
her
sprained
ankle
then
she
righted
the
tabouret
sat
down
on
it
and
began
on
me
do
you
know
that
you
have
not
been
to
the
office
for
two
days
she
said
severely
and
do
you
know
that
hawes
had
hysterics
in
our
front
hall
last
night
you
had
a
case
in
court
yesterday
did
you
nothing
very
much
i
said
looking
over
her
head
anyhow
i
tired
i
do
know
when
i
going
back
i
need
a
vacation
she
reached
behind
her
and
pulling
the
cord
sent
the
window
shade
to
the
top
of
the
window
at
the
sight
of
my
face
thus
revealed
she
drew
a
long
sigh
the
biggest
case
you
ever
had
jack
the
biggest
retainer
you
ever
had
i
spent
that
i
protested
feebly
a
vacation
and
you
only
back
from
pinehurst
the
girl
was
in
trouble
in
trouble
edith
i
burst
out
any
one
would
have
done
the
same
thing
even
fred
would
hardly
have
deserted
that
household
it
stricken
positively
stricken
my
remark
about
fred
did
not
draw
her
from
cover
of
course
it
your
own
affair
she
said
not
looking
at
me
and
goodness
knows
i
disinterested
about
it
you
ruin
the
boys
both
stomachs
and
dispositions
and
i
could
use
your
room
as
a
edith
you
abominable
little
liar
she
dabbed
at
her
eyes
furiously
with
her
handkerchief
and
walked
with
great
dignity
to
the
door
then
she
came
back
and
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
oh
jack
if
we
could
only
have
saved
you
this
she
said
and
a
minute
later
when
i
did
not
speak
who
is
the
man
dear
a
distant
relative
harry
wardrop
i
replied
with
what
i
think
was
very
nearly
my
natural
tone
do
worry
edith
it
all
right
known
it
right
along
pooh
edith
returned
sagely
so
do
i
know
i
got
to
die
and
be
buried
some
day
its
being
inevitable
does
make
it
any
more
cheerful
she
went
out
but
she
came
back
in
a
moment
and
stuck
her
head
through
the
door
the
only
inevitable
thing
there
is
she
said
taking
up
the
conversation
an
old
habit
of
hers
where
she
had
left
off
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
retorted
turning
my
back
on
her
and
anyhow
i
regard
your
suggestion
as
immoral
but
when
i
turned
again
she
had
gone
that
saturday
afternoon
at
four
the
body
of
allan
fleming
was
brought
home
and
placed
in
state
in
the
of
the
house
miss
jane
had
been
missing
since
thursday
night
i
called
hunter
by
telephone
and
he
had
nothing
to
report
chapter
xi
a
night
in
the
fleming
home
i
had
a
tearful
message
from
hawes
late
that
afternoon
and
a
little
after
five
i
went
to
the
office
i
found
him
offering
late
editions
of
the
evening
paper
to
a
couple
of
clients
who
were
edging
toward
the
door
his
expression
when
he
saw
me
was
pure
relief
the
clients
relief
strongly
mixed
with
irritation
i
put
the
best
face
on
the
matter
that
i
could
saw
my
visitors
and
left
alone
prepared
to
explain
to
hawes
what
i
could
hardly
explain
to
myself
i
been
unavoidably
detained
hawes
i
said
miss
jane
maitland
has
disappeared
from
her
home
so
i
understood
you
over
the
telephone
he
had
brought
my
mail
and
stood
by
impassive
also
her
is
dead
the
papers
are
full
of
it
there
was
no
one
to
do
anything
hawes
i
was
obliged
to
stay
i
apologized
i
was
ostentatiously
examining
my
letters
and
hawes
said
nothing
i
looked
up
at
him
sideways
and
he
looked
down
at
me
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
quivered
save
one
eye
which
has
a
peculiar
twitching
of
the
lid
when
he
is
excited
it
gave
him
a
sardonic
appearance
of
winking
he
winked
at
me
then
do
wait
hawes
i
said
guiltily
and
he
took
his
hat
and
went
out
every
line
of
his
back
was
accusation
the
sag
of
his
shoulders
told
me
i
had
let
my
biggest
case
go
by
default
that
day
the
forward
tilt
of
his
head
that
i
was
probably
insane
the
very
grip
with
which
he
seized
the
his
good
night
from
around
the
door
that
he
knew
there
was
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
i
put
down
my
letters
and
dropped
my
face
in
my
hands
hawes
was
right
no
amount
of
professional
zeal
could
account
for
the
interest
i
had
taken
partly
through
force
of
circumstances
partly
of
my
own
volition
i
had
placed
myself
in
the
position
of
first
friend
to
a
family
with
which
i
had
had
only
professional
relations
i
had
even
enlisted
edith
when
my
acquaintance
with
margery
fleming
was
only
three
days
old
and
at
the
thought
of
the
girl
of
wardrop
inefficiency
and
my
own
hopelessness
i
groaned
aloud
i
had
not
heard
the
door
open
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
a
gentleman
was
here
half
a
dozen
times
to
see
you
he
did
give
any
name
i
dropped
my
hands
from
around
the
door
hawes
nervous
eye
was
winking
wildly
you
not
sick
mr
knox
never
felt
better
i
thought
i
heard
i
was
singing
i
lied
looking
him
straight
in
the
eye
he
backed
nervously
to
the
door
i
have
a
little
sherry
in
my
office
knox
years
in
the
wood
if
you
for
god
sake
hawes
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
i
exclaimed
and
he
went
but
i
heard
him
stand
a
perceptible
time
outside
the
door
before
he
tiptoed
away
almost
immediately
after
some
one
entered
the
and
the
next
moment
i
was
facing
in
the
doorway
a
man
i
had
never
seen
before
he
was
a
tall
man
with
thin
colorless
beard
trimmed
to
a
vandyke
point
and
pale
eyes
blinking
behind
glasses
he
had
a
soft
hat
crushed
in
his
hand
and
his
whole
manner
was
one
of
subdued
excitement
mr
knox
he
asked
from
the
doorway
yes
come
in
i
have
been
here
six
times
since
noon
he
said
dropping
rather
than
sitting
in
a
chair
my
name
is
lightfoot
i
am
was
cashier
yes
i
was
terribly
shocked
at
the
news
of
his
death
he
stumbled
on
getting
no
help
from
me
i
was
in
town
and
if
i
had
known
in
time
i
could
have
kept
some
of
the
details
out
of
the
papers
poor
fleming
to
think
he
would
end
it
that
way
end
it
shoot
himself
he
watched
me
closely
but
he
did
i
protested
it
was
not
suicide
lightfoot
according
to
the
police
it
was
murder
his
cold
eyes
narrowed
like
a
cat
murder
is
an
ugly
word
knox
do
let
us
be
sensational
fleming
had
threatened
to
kill
himself
more
than
once
ask
young
wardrop
he
was
sick
and
despondent
he
left
his
home
without
a
word
which
points
strongly
to
emotional
insanity
he
could
have
gone
to
any
one
of
a
half
dozen
large
clubs
here
or
at
the
capital
instead
he
goes
to
a
little
political
club
where
presumably
he
does
his
own
cooking
and
hides
in
a
dingy
room
is
that
sane
murder
it
was
suicide
and
that
puppy
wardrop
knows
it
well
enough
i
i
wish
i
had
him
by
the
throat
he
had
worked
himself
into
quite
a
respectable
rage
but
now
he
calmed
himself
i
have
seen
the
police
he
went
on
they
agree
with
me
that
it
was
suicide
and
the
party
newspapers
will
straighten
it
out
it
is
only
unfortunate
that
the
murder
theory
was
given
so
much
publicity
the
which
is
democratic
of
course
i
can
not
handle
i
sat
stupefied
suicide
i
said
finally
with
no
weapon
no
powder
marks
and
with
a
letter
at
his
elbow
he
brushed
my
interruption
aside
fleming
had
been
careless
he
said
i
can
tell
you
in
confidence
that
some
of
the
state
funds
had
been
deposited
in
the
borough
bank
of
manchester
and
the
borough
bank
closed
its
doors
at
ten
i
was
hardly
surprised
at
that
but
the
whole
trend
of
events
was
amazing
i
arrived
here
last
night
he
said
and
i
searched
the
city
for
fleming
this
morning
i
heard
the
news
i
have
just
come
from
the
house
his
daughter
referred
me
to
you
after
all
what
i
want
is
a
small
matter
some
papers
state
documents
are
missing
and
no
doubt
are
among
fleming
private
effects
i
would
like
to
go
through
his
papers
and
leave
for
the
capital
i
have
hardly
the
authority
i
replied
doubtfully
miss
fleming
i
suppose
would
have
no
objection
his
private
secretary
wardrop
would
be
the
one
to
superintend
such
a
search
can
you
find
wardrop
at
once
something
in
his
eagerness
put
me
on
my
guard
i
will
make
an
attempt
i
said
let
me
have
the
name
of
your
hotel
and
i
will
telephone
you
if
it
can
be
arranged
for
he
had
to
be
satisfied
with
that
but
his
eagerness
seemed
to
me
to
be
almost
desperation
oddly
enough
i
could
not
locate
wardrop
after
all
i
got
the
maitland
house
by
telephone
to
learn
that
he
had
left
there
about
three
and
had
not
come
back
i
went
to
the
fleming
house
for
dinner
edith
was
still
there
and
we
both
tried
to
cheer
margery
a
sad
little
figure
in
her
black
clothes
after
the
meal
i
called
lightfoot
at
his
hotel
and
told
him
that
i
could
not
find
wardrop
that
there
were
no
papers
at
the
house
and
that
the
office
safe
would
have
to
wait
until
wardrop
was
found
to
open
it
he
was
disappointed
and
furious
like
a
good
many
men
who
are
physical
cowards
he
said
a
great
deal
over
the
telephone
that
he
would
not
have
dared
to
say
to
my
face
and
i
cut
him
off
by
hanging
up
the
receiver
from
that
minute
in
the
struggle
that
was
coming
like
fred
i
was
forninst
the
government
it
was
arranged
that
edith
should
take
margery
home
with
her
for
the
night
i
thought
it
a
good
idea
the
very
sight
of
edith
tucking
in
her
babies
and
sitting
down
beside
the
library
lamp
to
embroider
me
a
for
christmas
would
bring
margery
back
to
normal
again
except
in
the
matter
of
christmas
gifts
edith
is
the
sanest
woman
i
know
i
recognized
it
at
the
dinner
table
where
she
had
the
little
girl
across
from
her
planning
her
mourning
hats
before
the
dinner
was
half
finished
when
we
rose
at
last
margery
looked
toward
the
where
the
dead
man
lay
in
state
but
edith
took
her
by
the
arm
and
pushed
her
toward
the
stairs
get
your
hat
on
right
away
while
jack
calls
a
cab
she
directed
i
must
get
home
or
fred
will
keep
the
boys
up
until
nine
he
is
absolutely
without
principle
when
margery
came
down
there
was
a
little
red
spot
burning
in
each
pale
cheek
and
she
ran
down
the
stairs
like
a
scared
child
at
the
bottom
she
clutched
the
and
looked
behind
fearfully
what
the
matter
edith
demanded
glancing
uneasily
over
her
shoulder
some
one
has
been
margery
panted
somebody
has
been
staying
in
the
house
while
we
were
away
nonsense
i
said
seeing
that
her
fright
was
infecting
edith
what
makes
you
think
that
come
and
look
she
said
gaining
courage
i
suppose
from
a
masculine
presence
and
so
we
went
up
the
long
stairs
the
two
girls
clutching
hands
and
i
leading
the
way
and
inclined
to
scoff
at
the
door
of
a
small
room
next
to
what
had
been
allan
bedroom
we
paused
and
i
turned
on
the
light
before
we
left
margery
said
more
quietly
i
closed
this
room
myself
it
had
just
been
done
over
and
the
pale
blue
soils
so
easily
i
came
in
the
last
thing
and
saw
covers
put
over
everything
now
look
at
it
it
was
a
sort
of
boudoir
filled
with
feminine
knickknacks
and
mahogany
lounging
chairs
wherever
possible
a
pale
brocade
had
been
used
on
the
empire
couch
in
panels
in
the
wall
covering
cushions
on
the
it
was
evidently
margery
private
the
linen
cover
that
had
been
thrown
over
the
divan
was
folded
back
and
a
pillow
from
the
bore
the
imprint
of
a
head
the
table
was
still
covered
knobby
protuberances
indicating
the
pictures
and
books
beneath
on
one
corner
of
the
table
where
the
cover
had
been
pushed
aside
was
a
cup
empty
and
and
as
if
to
prove
her
contention
margery
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
newspaper
dated
friday
morning
the
a
used
towel
in
the
completed
the
inventory
margery
had
been
right
some
one
had
used
the
room
while
the
house
was
closed
might
it
not
have
been
your
father
edith
asked
when
we
stood
again
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
could
have
come
here
to
look
for
something
and
lain
down
to
rest
i
do
think
so
margery
said
wanly
i
left
the
door
so
he
could
get
in
with
his
key
but
he
always
used
his
study
couch
i
do
think
he
ever
spent
five
minutes
in
my
in
his
life
we
had
to
let
it
go
at
that
finally
i
put
them
in
a
cab
and
saw
them
start
away
then
i
went
back
into
the
house
i
had
arranged
to
sleep
there
and
generally
to
look
after
things
as
i
said
before
whatever
scruples
i
had
had
about
taking
charge
of
margery
fleming
and
her
affairs
had
faded
with
wardrop
defection
and
the
new
mystery
of
the
blue
boudoir
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
was
full
of
people
that
night
local
and
state
politicians
newspaper
men
and
the
usual
crowd
of
the
morbidly
curious
the
undertaker
took
everything
in
hand
and
late
that
evening
i
could
hear
them
carrying
in
tropical
plants
and
stands
for
the
flowers
that
were
already
arriving
whatever
panoply
the
death
scene
had
lacked
allan
fleming
was
lying
in
state
now
at
midnight
things
grew
quiet
i
sat
in
the
library
reading
until
then
when
an
undertaker
assistant
in
a
pink
shirt
and
cravat
came
to
tell
me
that
everything
was
done
is
it
customary
for
somebody
to
stay
up
on
occasions
like
this
i
asked
is
there
an
impression
that
wandering
cats
may
get
into
the
room
or
something
of
that
sort
i
do
think
it
will
be
necessary
sir
he
said
trying
to
conceal
a
smile
it
all
a
matter
of
taste
some
people
like
to
take
their
troubles
hard
since
they
do
put
money
on
their
eyes
any
more
nobody
wants
to
rob
the
dead
he
left
with
that
cheerful
remark
and
i
closed
and
locked
the
house
after
him
i
found
bella
in
the
basement
kitchen
with
all
the
lights
burning
full
and
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
while
she
scooted
to
bed
like
a
scared
rabbit
she
was
a
strange
creature
bella
not
so
stupid
as
she
looked
but
sullen
morose
smouldering
about
expresses
it
i
closed
the
doors
into
the
and
leaving
one
light
in
the
hall
went
up
to
bed
a
guest
room
in
the
third
story
had
been
assigned
me
and
i
was
tired
enough
to
have
slept
on
the
floor
the
telephone
bell
rang
just
after
i
got
into
bed
and
grumbling
at
my
luck
i
went
down
to
the
lower
floor
it
was
the
and
the
man
at
the
telephone
was
in
a
hurry
this
is
the
is
wardrop
there
no
who
is
this
this
is
john
knox
the
attorney
yes
knox
are
you
willing
to
put
yourself
on
record
that
fleming
committed
suicide
i
am
not
going
to
put
myself
on
record
at
all
says
you
call
it
suicide
and
that
you
found
him
with
the
revolver
in
his
hand
the
lies
i
retorted
and
the
man
at
the
other
end
chuckled
many
thanks
he
said
and
rang
off
i
went
back
to
bed
irritated
that
i
had
betrayed
myself
loss
of
sleep
for
two
nights
however
had
told
on
me
in
a
short
time
i
was
sound
asleep
i
wakened
with
difficulty
my
head
felt
stupid
and
heavy
and
i
was
burning
with
thirst
i
sat
up
and
wondered
vaguely
if
i
were
going
to
be
ill
and
i
remember
that
i
felt
too
weary
to
get
a
drink
as
i
roused
however
i
found
that
part
of
my
discomfort
came
from
bad
ventilation
and
i
opened
a
window
and
looked
out
the
window
was
a
side
one
opening
on
to
a
space
perhaps
eight
feet
wide
which
separated
it
from
its
neighbor
across
from
me
was
only
a
blank
red
wall
but
the
night
air
greeted
me
refreshingly
the
wind
was
blowing
hard
and
a
shutter
was
banging
somewhere
below
i
leaned
out
and
looked
down
into
the
space
beneath
me
it
was
one
of
those
apparently
chance
movements
that
have
vital
consequences
and
that
have
always
made
me
believe
in
the
old
calvinistic
creed
of
foreordination
below
me
on
the
wall
across
was
a
rectangle
of
yellow
light
reflected
from
the
library
window
of
the
fleming
home
there
was
some
one
in
the
house
as
i
still
stared
the
light
was
slowly
blotted
out
not
as
if
the
light
had
been
switched
off
but
by
a
gradual
decreasing
in
size
of
the
lighted
area
the
library
shade
had
been
drawn
my
first
thought
was
burglars
my
second
lightfoot
no
matter
who
it
was
there
was
no
one
who
had
business
there
luckily
i
had
brought
my
revolver
with
me
from
fred
that
day
and
it
was
under
my
pillow
to
get
it
put
out
the
light
and
open
the
door
quietly
took
only
a
minute
i
was
in
pajamas
barefoot
as
on
another
almost
similar
occasion
but
i
was
better
armed
than
before
i
got
to
the
second
floor
without
hearing
or
seeing
anything
suspicious
but
from
there
i
could
see
that
the
light
in
the
hall
had
been
extinguished
the
unfamiliarity
of
the
house
the
knowledge
of
the
silent
figure
in
the
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
of
whatever
might
be
waiting
in
the
library
beyond
made
my
position
uncomfortable
to
say
the
least
i
do
believe
in
the
man
who
is
never
afraid
he
does
deserve
the
credit
he
gets
it
the
fellow
who
is
scared
to
death
whose
knees
knock
together
and
who
totters
rather
than
walks
into
danger
who
is
the
real
hero
not
that
i
was
as
bad
as
that
but
i
would
have
liked
to
know
where
the
electric
switch
was
and
to
have
seen
the
trap
before
i
put
my
head
in
the
stairs
were
solidly
built
and
did
not
creak
i
felt
my
way
down
by
the
baluster
which
required
my
right
hand
and
threw
my
revolver
to
my
left
i
got
safely
to
the
bottom
and
around
the
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
library
and
the
door
was
not
entirely
closed
then
with
my
usual
bad
luck
i
ran
into
a
heap
of
folding
chairs
that
had
been
left
by
the
undertaker
and
if
the
crash
paralyzed
me
i
know
what
it
did
to
the
intruder
in
the
library
the
light
was
out
in
an
instant
and
with
concealment
at
an
end
i
broke
for
the
door
and
threw
it
open
standing
there
with
my
revolver
leveled
we
the
man
in
the
room
and
i
were
both
in
absolute
darkness
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
he
knew
my
location
and
i
could
not
guess
his
who
is
here
i
demanded
only
silence
except
that
i
seemed
to
hear
rapid
breathing
speak
up
or
i
shoot
i
said
not
without
an
ugly
feeling
that
he
might
be
even
probably
was
taking
careful
aim
by
my
voice
the
darkness
was
intolerable
i
reached
cautiously
to
the
left
and
found
just
beyond
the
door
frame
the
electric
switch
as
i
turned
it
the
light
flashed
up
the
room
was
empty
but
a
portière
in
a
doorway
at
my
right
was
still
shaking
i
leaped
for
the
curtain
and
dragged
it
aside
to
have
a
door
just
close
in
my
face
when
i
had
jerked
it
open
i
found
myself
in
a
short
hall
and
there
were
footsteps
to
my
left
i
blundered
along
in
the
into
a
black
void
which
must
have
been
the
for
my
outstretched
hand
skirted
the
table
the
footsteps
seemed
only
beyond
my
reach
and
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
swinging
door
into
the
pantry
was
still
swaying
when
i
caught
it
i
made
a
misstep
in
the
pantry
and
brought
up
against
a
blank
wall
it
seemed
to
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
feet
running
up
steps
and
when
i
found
a
door
at
last
i
threw
it
open
and
dashed
in
the
next
moment
the
solid
earth
slipped
from
under
my
feet
i
threw
out
my
hand
and
it
met
a
cold
wall
smooth
as
glass
then
i
fell
fell
an
incalculable
distance
and
the
blackness
of
the
night
came
over
me
and
smothered
me
chapter
xii
my
commission
when
i
came
to
i
was
lying
in
darkness
and
the
stillness
was
absolute
when
i
tried
to
move
i
found
i
was
practically
a
prisoner
i
had
fallen
into
an
air
shaft
or
something
of
the
kind
i
could
not
move
my
arms
where
they
were
pinioned
to
my
sides
and
i
was
in
a
position
i
worked
one
arm
loose
and
managed
to
make
out
that
my
prison
was
probably
the
shaft
to
the
basement
kitchen
i
had
landed
on
top
of
the
slide
and
i
seemed
to
be
tied
in
a
knot
the
revolver
was
under
me
and
if
it
had
exploded
during
the
fall
it
had
done
no
damage
i
can
hardly
imagine
a
more
unpleasant
position
if
the
man
i
had
been
following
had
so
chosen
he
could
have
made
away
with
me
in
any
one
of
a
dozen
unpleasant
ways
he
could
have
filled
me
as
full
of
holes
as
a
sieve
or
scalded
me
or
done
anything
pretty
much
that
he
chose
but
nothing
happened
the
house
was
impressively
quiet
i
had
fallen
feet
first
evidently
and
then
crumpled
up
unconscious
for
one
of
my
ankles
was
throbbing
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
stand
erect
and
even
by
reaching
i
could
not
touch
the
doorway
above
me
it
must
have
taken
five
minutes
for
my
confused
senses
to
remember
the
wire
cable
and
to
tug
at
it
i
was
a
heavy
load
for
the
slide
accustomed
to
nothing
weightier
than
political
dinners
but
with
much
creaking
i
got
myself
at
last
to
the
floor
above
and
stepped
out
still
into
darkness
but
free
i
still
held
the
revolver
and
i
lighted
the
whole
lower
floor
but
i
found
nothing
in
the
or
the
pantry
everything
was
locked
and
in
good
order
a
small
alcove
off
the
library
came
next
it
was
undisturbed
but
a
tabouret
lay
on
its
side
and
a
half
dozen
books
had
been
taken
from
a
low
and
lay
heaped
on
a
chair
in
the
library
however
everything
was
confusion
desk
drawers
stood
open
one
of
the
linen
shades
had
been
pulled
partly
off
its
roller
a
chair
had
been
drawn
up
to
the
long
mahogany
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
with
the
electric
dome
overhead
and
everywhere
on
chairs
over
the
floor
heaped
in
stacks
on
the
table
were
papers
after
searching
the
lower
floor
and
finding
everything
securely
locked
i
went
convinced
the
intruder
was
still
in
the
house
i
made
a
systematic
search
of
every
room
looking
into
closets
and
under
beds
several
times
i
had
an
impression
as
i
turned
a
corner
that
some
one
was
just
ahead
of
me
but
i
was
always
disappointed
i
gave
up
at
last
and
going
down
to
the
library
made
myself
as
comfortable
as
i
could
and
waited
for
morning
i
heard
bella
coming
down
the
stairs
after
seven
sometime
she
came
slowly
with
flagging
footsteps
as
if
the
slightest
sound
would
send
her
scurrying
to
the
upper
regions
again
a
little
later
i
heard
her
rattling
the
range
in
the
basement
kitchen
and
i
went
and
dressed
i
was
too
tired
to
have
a
theory
about
the
night
visitor
in
fact
from
that
time
on
i
tried
to
have
no
theories
of
any
kind
i
was
impressed
with
only
one
thing
that
the
enemy
or
enemies
of
the
late
allan
fleming
evidently
carried
their
antagonism
beyond
the
grave
as
i
put
on
my
collar
i
wondered
how
long
i
could
stay
in
this
game
as
i
now
meant
to
and
avoid
lying
in
state
in
edith
little
with
flowers
around
and
a
gentleman
in
black
gloves
at
the
door
i
had
my
ankle
strapped
with
adhesive
that
morning
by
my
doctor
and
it
gave
me
no
more
trouble
but
i
caught
him
looking
curiously
at
the
blue
bruise
on
my
forehead
where
wardrop
had
struck
me
with
the
chair
and
at
my
nose
no
longer
swollen
but
at
the
bridge
been
doing
any
boxing
lately
he
said
as
i
laced
up
my
shoe
not
for
two
or
three
years
new
machine
no
he
smiled
at
me
quizzically
from
his
desk
how
does
the
other
fellow
look
he
inquired
and
to
my
haltingly
invented
explanation
of
my
battered
appearance
he
returned
the
same
enigmatical
smile
that
day
was
uneventful
margery
and
edith
came
to
the
house
for
about
an
hour
and
went
back
to
fred
again
a
cousin
of
the
dead
man
an
elderly
bachelor
named
parker
appeared
that
morning
and
signified
his
willingness
to
take
charge
of
the
house
during
that
day
the
very
hush
of
his
voice
and
his
black
tie
prompted
edith
to
remove
margery
from
him
as
soon
as
she
could
and
as
the
girl
dreaded
the
curious
eyes
of
the
crowd
that
filled
the
house
she
was
glad
to
go
it
was
sunday
and
i
went
to
the
office
only
long
enough
to
look
over
my
mail
i
dined
in
the
middle
of
the
day
at
fred
and
felt
heavy
and
stupid
all
afternoon
as
a
result
of
thus
reversing
the
habits
of
the
week
in
the
afternoon
i
had
my
first
conversation
with
fred
and
edith
while
margery
and
the
boys
talked
quietly
in
the
nursery
they
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
and
she
was
almost
cheerful
when
she
was
with
them
fred
had
the
morning
papers
around
him
on
the
floor
and
was
in
his
usual
sunday
argumentative
mood
well
he
said
when
the
nursery
door
had
closed
what
was
it
jack
suicide
i
do
know
i
replied
bluntly
what
do
you
think
he
insisted
how
can
i
tell
irritably
the
police
say
it
was
suicide
and
they
ought
to
know
the
says
it
was
murder
and
that
they
will
prove
it
and
they
claim
the
police
have
been
called
off
i
said
nothing
of
lightfoot
and
his
visit
to
the
office
but
i
made
a
mental
note
to
see
the
people
and
learn
if
i
could
what
they
knew
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
he
deserved
very
nearly
what
he
got
edith
broke
in
looking
much
less
vindictive
than
her
words
when
one
thinks
of
the
ruin
he
brought
to
poor
henry
butler
and
that
ellen
has
been
practically
an
invalid
ever
since
i
ca
be
sorry
for
him
what
was
the
butler
story
i
asked
but
fred
did
not
know
and
edith
was
as
vague
as
women
usually
are
in
politics
henry
butler
was
treasurer
of
the
state
and
fleming
was
his
cashier
i
do
know
just
what
the
trouble
was
but
you
remember
that
henry
butler
killed
himself
after
he
got
out
of
the
penitentiary
and
ellen
has
been
in
one
hospital
after
another
i
would
like
to
have
her
come
here
for
a
few
weeks
fred
she
said
appealingly
she
is
in
some
sanatorium
or
other
now
and
we
might
cheer
her
a
little
fred
groaned
have
her
if
you
like
petty
he
said
resignedly
but
i
refuse
to
be
cheerful
unless
i
feel
like
it
what
about
this
young
wardrop
jack
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
reporter
had
a
line
on
him
hush
edith
said
softly
he
is
margery
fiancé
and
she
might
hear
you
how
do
you
know
fred
demanded
did
she
tell
you
look
at
her
engagement
ring
edith
threw
back
triumphantly
and
a
perfectly
beautiful
solitaire
too
i
caught
fred
eye
on
me
and
the
very
speed
with
which
he
shifted
his
gaze
made
me
uncomfortable
i
made
my
escape
as
soon
as
i
could
on
the
plea
of
going
out
to
bellwood
and
in
the
hall
i
met
margery
i
saw
bella
she
said
knox
will
you
tell
me
why
you
stayed
up
last
night
what
happened
in
the
house
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
in
the
library
i
stammered
but
i
found
no
one
is
that
all
the
truth
or
only
part
of
it
she
asked
why
do
men
always
evade
issues
with
a
woman
luckily
she
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
she
closed
the
nursery
door
and
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
looking
down
i
wonder
what
you
believe
about
all
this
she
said
do
you
think
my
father
killed
himself
you
were
there
you
know
if
some
one
would
only
tell
me
everything
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
her
right
to
know
the
boys
were
romping
noisily
in
the
nursery
fred
and
edith
were
having
their
sunday
afternoon
discussion
of
what
in
the
world
had
become
of
the
money
from
fred
latest
book
margery
and
i
sat
down
on
the
stairs
and
as
well
as
i
could
remember
the
details
i
told
her
what
had
happened
at
the
white
cat
she
heard
me
through
quietly
and
so
the
police
have
given
up
the
case
she
said
despairingly
and
if
they
had
not
harry
would
have
been
arrested
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
do
i
have
to
sit
back
with
my
hands
folded
the
police
have
not
exactly
given
up
the
case
i
told
her
but
there
is
such
a
thing
of
course
as
stirring
up
a
lot
of
dust
and
then
running
to
cover
like
blazes
before
it
settles
by
the
time
the
public
has
wiped
it
out
of
its
eyes
and
sneezed
it
out
of
its
nose
and
coughed
it
out
of
its
larynx
the
dust
has
settled
in
a
heavy
layer
clues
are
obliterated
and
the
public
lifts
its
skirts
and
chooses
another
direction
the
thoroughfare
sign
is
up
she
sat
there
for
fifteen
minutes
interrupted
by
occasional
noisy
excursions
from
the
nursery
which
resulted
in
her
acquiring
by
degrees
a
lapful
of
broken
wheels
horses
and
a
live
water
beetle
which
the
boys
had
found
under
the
kitchen
sink
and
imprisoned
in
a
glass
topped
box
where
to
its
bewilderment
they
were
assiduously
offering
it
dead
and
mangled
flies
but
our
last
five
minutes
were
undisturbed
and
the
girl
brought
out
with
an
effort
the
request
she
had
tried
to
make
all
day
whoever
killed
my
father
and
it
was
murder
knox
whoever
did
it
is
going
free
to
save
a
scandal
all
my
friends
she
smiled
bitterly
are
afraid
of
the
same
thing
but
i
can
not
sit
quiet
and
think
nothing
can
be
done
i
know
and
you
are
the
only
one
who
seems
willing
to
try
to
find
out
so
it
was
that
when
i
left
the
house
a
half
hour
later
i
was
committed
i
had
been
commissioned
by
the
girl
i
loved
for
it
had
come
to
that
to
clear
her
lover
of
her
father
murder
and
so
give
him
back
to
her
not
in
so
many
words
but
i
was
to
follow
up
the
crime
and
the
rest
followed
and
i
was
morally
certain
of
two
things
first
that
her
lover
was
not
worthy
of
her
and
second
and
more
to
the
point
that
innocent
or
guilty
he
was
indirectly
implicated
in
the
crime
i
had
promised
her
also
to
see
miss
letitia
that
day
if
i
could
and
i
turned
over
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
as
i
walked
toward
the
station
but
i
made
nothing
of
them
one
thing
occurred
to
me
however
bella
had
told
margery
that
i
had
been
up
all
night
could
bella
but
i
dismissed
the
thought
as
absurd
bella
who
had
scuttled
to
bed
in
a
panic
of
fright
would
never
have
dared
the
lower
floor
alone
and
bella
given
all
the
courage
in
the
world
could
never
have
moved
with
the
swiftness
and
light
certainty
of
my
midnight
prowler
it
had
not
been
bella
but
after
all
i
did
not
go
to
bellwood
i
met
hunter
on
my
way
to
the
station
and
he
turned
around
and
walked
with
me
so
you
lain
down
on
the
case
i
said
when
we
had
gone
a
few
steps
without
speaking
he
grumbled
something
unintelligible
and
probably
unrepeatable
of
course
i
persisted
being
a
simple
and
uncomplicated
case
of
suicide
there
was
nothing
in
it
anyhow
if
it
had
been
a
murder
under
peculiar
circumstances
he
stopped
and
gripped
my
arm
for
ten
cents
he
said
gravely
i
would
tell
the
chief
and
a
few
others
what
i
think
of
them
and
then
i
go
out
and
get
full
not
on
ten
cents
i
going
out
of
the
business
he
stormed
i
going
to
drive
a
garbage
wagon
it
cleaner
than
this
job
suicide
i
never
saw
a
cleaner
case
of
he
stopped
suddenly
do
you
know
burton
of
the
no
i
heard
of
him
well
he
your
man
they
dead
against
the
ring
and
burton
been
given
the
case
he
as
sharp
as
a
steel
trap
you
two
get
together
he
paused
at
a
corner
he
said
dejectedly
i
off
to
hunt
some
boys
that
have
been
stealing
milk
bottles
that
about
my
size
these
days
he
turned
around
however
before
he
had
gone
many
steps
and
came
back
wardrop
has
been
missing
since
yesterday
afternoon
he
said
that
is
he
thinks
he
missing
we
got
him
all
right
i
gave
up
my
bellwood
visit
for
the
time
and
taking
a
car
i
went
to
the
office
the
monday
morning
edition
was
already
under
way
as
far
as
the
staff
was
concerned
and
from
the
i
could
see
three
or
four
men
with
their
hats
on
most
of
them
rattling
typewriters
burton
came
in
in
a
moment
a
young
fellow
with
a
short
thick
nose
and
a
muggy
skin
he
was
rather
stocky
in
build
and
the
pugnacity
of
his
features
did
not
hide
the
shrewdness
of
his
eyes
i
introduced
myself
and
at
my
name
his
perfunctory
manner
changed
knox
he
said
i
called
you
last
night
over
the
ca
we
talk
in
a
more
private
place
i
asked
trying
to
raise
my
voice
above
the
confusion
of
the
next
room
in
reply
he
took
me
into
a
tiny
office
containing
a
desk
and
two
chairs
and
separated
by
an
partition
from
the
other
room
this
is
the
best
we
have
he
explained
cheerfully
newspapers
are
agents
of
publicity
not
privacy
if
you
do
care
what
you
say
i
liked
burton
there
was
something
genuine
about
him
after
finish
he
was
a
relief
hunter
of
the
detective
bureau
sent
me
here
i
proceeded
about
the
fleming
case
he
took
out
his
you
are
the
fourth
he
said
hunter
himself
lightfoot
from
plattsburg
and
mcfeely
here
in
town
well
knox
are
you
willing
now
to
put
yourself
on
record
that
fleming
committed
suicide
no
i
said
firmly
it
is
my
belief
that
he
was
murdered
and
that
the
secretary
fellow
what
his
name
wardrop
that
he
killed
him
possibly
in
reply
burton
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
brought
up
a
pasteboard
box
filled
with
jeweler
cotton
underneath
was
a
small
object
which
he
passed
to
me
with
care
i
got
it
from
the
coroner
physician
who
performed
the
autopsy
he
said
casually
you
will
notice
that
it
is
a
and
that
the
revolver
they
took
from
wardrop
was
a
question
the
other
gun
i
gave
him
back
the
bullet
and
he
rolled
it
around
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
little
thing
is
it
he
said
we
think
we
lords
of
creation
until
we
see
a
bichloride
tablet
or
a
bit
of
lead
like
this
look
here
he
dived
into
his
pocket
again
and
drew
out
a
roll
of
ordinary
brown
paper
when
he
opened
it
a
bit
of
white
chalk
fell
on
the
desk
look
at
that
he
said
dramatically
kill
an
army
with
it
and
never
know
what
struck
them
cyanide
of
potassium
and
the
druggist
that
sold
it
ought
to
be
choked
where
did
it
come
from
i
asked
curiously
burton
smiled
his
cheerful
smile
it
a
beautiful
case
all
around
he
said
as
he
got
his
hat
i
have
had
any
sunday
dinner
yet
and
it
five
oh
the
cyanide
clarkson
the
cashier
of
the
bank
fleming
ruined
took
a
bite
off
that
corner
right
there
this
morning
clarkson
i
exclaimed
how
is
he
god
only
knows
said
burton
gravely
from
which
i
took
it
clarkson
was
dead
chapter
xiii
sizzling
metal
burton
listened
while
he
ate
and
his
cheerful
comments
were
welcome
enough
after
the
depression
of
the
last
few
days
i
told
him
after
some
hesitation
the
whole
thing
beginning
with
the
maitland
pearls
and
ending
with
my
drop
down
the
i
knew
i
was
absolutely
safe
in
doing
so
there
is
no
person
to
whom
i
would
rather
tell
a
secret
than
a
newspaper
man
he
will
go
out
of
his
way
to
keep
it
he
will
lock
it
in
the
depths
of
his
bosom
and
keep
it
until
seventy
times
seven
also
you
may
threaten
the
rack
or
offer
a
larger
salary
the
seal
does
not
come
off
his
lips
until
the
word
is
given
if
then
he
makes
a
scarehead
of
it
and
gets
in
three
columns
of
space
and
as
many
photographs
it
is
his
just
reward
so
i
told
burton
everything
and
he
ate
enough
beefsteak
for
two
men
and
missed
not
a
word
i
said
the
money
wardrop
had
in
the
grip
that
easy
enough
explained
he
said
fleming
used
the
borough
bank
to
deposit
state
funds
in
he
must
have
known
it
was
rotten
he
and
clarkson
were
as
thick
as
thieves
according
to
a
custom
in
our
land
of
the
brave
and
home
of
the
free
a
state
treasurer
who
is
crooked
can
in
such
a
case
draw
on
such
a
bank
without
security
on
his
personal
note
which
is
usually
worth
its
value
by
the
pound
as
old
paper
and
fleming
did
that
he
did
then
things
got
bad
at
the
borough
bank
fleming
had
had
to
divide
with
schwartz
and
the
lord
only
knows
who
all
but
it
was
fleming
who
had
to
put
in
the
money
to
avert
a
crash
the
word
crash
being
synonymous
with
scandal
in
this
case
he
scrapes
together
a
paltry
hundred
thousand
which
wardrop
gets
at
the
capital
and
brings
on
wardrop
is
robbed
or
says
he
is
the
bank
collapses
and
clarkson
driven
to
the
wall
kills
himself
just
after
fleming
is
murdered
what
does
that
sound
like
like
clarkson
i
exclaimed
and
clarkson
knew
fleming
was
hiding
at
the
white
cat
now
then
take
the
other
theory
he
said
pushing
aside
his
cup
wardrop
goes
in
to
fleming
with
a
story
that
he
has
been
robbed
fleming
gets
crazy
and
attacks
him
all
that
is
in
the
morning
friday
now
then
wardrop
goes
back
there
that
night
within
twenty
minutes
after
he
enters
the
club
he
rushes
out
and
when
hunter
follows
him
he
says
he
is
looking
for
a
doctor
to
get
cocaine
for
a
gentleman
he
is
white
and
trembling
they
go
back
together
and
find
you
there
and
fleming
dead
wardrop
tells
two
stories
first
he
says
fleming
committed
suicide
just
before
he
left
then
he
changes
it
and
says
he
was
dead
when
he
arrived
there
he
produces
the
weapon
with
which
fleming
is
supposed
to
have
killed
himself
and
which
by
the
way
miss
fleming
identified
yesterday
as
her
father
but
there
are
two
discrepancies
wardrop
practically
admitted
that
he
had
taken
that
revolver
from
fleming
not
that
night
but
the
morning
before
during
the
quarrel
and
the
other
discrepancy
the
bullet
nobody
ever
fired
a
bullet
out
of
a
caliber
revolver
unless
he
was
trying
to
shoot
a
curve
now
then
who
does
it
look
like
like
wardrop
i
confessed
by
jove
they
did
both
do
it
and
he
did
do
it
himself
for
two
good
reasons
he
had
no
revolver
that
night
and
there
were
no
powder
marks
and
the
eleven
and
miss
maitland
disappearance
he
looked
at
me
with
his
quizzical
smile
i
have
to
have
another
steak
if
i
to
settle
that
he
said
i
can
only
solve
one
murder
on
one
steak
but
disappearances
are
my
specialty
perhaps
if
i
have
a
piece
of
pie
and
some
cheese
but
i
got
him
away
at
last
and
we
walked
together
down
the
street
i
ca
quite
see
the
old
lady
in
it
he
confessed
she
had
any
grudge
against
fleming
had
she
would
be
likely
to
forget
herself
temporarily
and
kill
him
good
lord
i
said
why
she
and
as
timid
and
gentle
a
little
old
lady
as
ever
lived
curls
he
asked
turning
his
bright
blue
eyes
on
me
yes
i
admitted
would
be
likely
to
have
eloped
with
the
minister
or
advertised
for
a
husband
or
anything
like
that
you
would
have
to
know
her
to
understand
i
said
resignedly
but
she
did
do
any
of
those
things
and
she
did
run
off
to
join
a
theatrical
troupe
burton
who
do
you
think
was
in
the
fleming
house
last
night
lightfoot
he
said
succinctly
he
stopped
under
a
street
lamp
and
looked
at
his
watch
i
believe
i
run
over
to
the
capital
he
said
while
gone
i
be
back
night
or
the
next
morning
i
wish
you
would
do
two
things
find
rosie
or
whatever
her
name
is
and
locate
carter
that
probably
not
his
name
but
it
will
answer
for
a
while
then
get
your
friend
hunter
to
keep
him
in
sight
for
a
while
until
i
come
back
anyhow
i
beginning
to
enjoy
this
it
more
fun
than
a
picture
puzzle
we
going
to
make
the
police
department
look
like
a
kindergarten
playing
jackstraws
and
the
second
thing
i
am
to
do
go
to
bellwood
and
find
out
a
few
things
it
all
well
enough
to
say
the
old
lady
was
a
meek
and
timid
person
but
if
you
want
to
know
her
peculiarities
go
to
her
neighbors
when
people
leave
the
beaten
path
the
neighbors
always
know
it
before
the
families
he
stopped
before
a
i
have
to
pack
for
my
little
jaunt
he
said
and
purchased
a
which
proved
to
be
the
extent
of
his
preparations
we
separated
at
the
station
burton
to
take
his
red
hair
and
his
to
plattsburg
i
to
take
a
taxicab
and
armed
with
a
page
torn
from
the
classified
directory
to
inquire
at
as
many
of
the
twelve
anderson
as
might
be
necessary
to
locate
delia
gentleman
friend
the
clerk
through
him
delia
and
through
delia
the
mysterious
carter
who
was
not
really
a
butler
it
occurred
to
me
somewhat
tardily
that
i
knew
nothing
of
delia
but
her
given
name
a
telephone
talk
with
margery
was
of
little
assistance
delia
had
been
a
new
maid
and
if
she
had
heard
her
other
name
she
had
forgotten
it
i
had
checked
off
eight
of
the
andersons
on
my
list
without
result
and
the
taximeter
showed
something
over
nineteen
dollars
when
the
driver
drew
up
at
the
curb
gentleman
in
the
other
cab
is
hailing
you
sir
he
said
over
his
shoulder
the
other
cab
the
one
that
has
been
following
us
i
opened
the
door
and
glanced
behind
a
duplicate
of
my
cab
stood
perhaps
fifty
feet
behind
and
from
it
a
familiar
figure
was
slowly
emerging
carrying
on
a
argument
with
the
chauffeur
the
figure
stopped
to
read
the
taximeter
shook
his
fist
at
the
chauffeur
and
approached
me
muttering
audibly
it
was
davidson
that
liar
and
thief
back
there
has
got
me
rung
up
for
nineteen
dollars
he
said
ignoring
my
amazement
nineteen
dollars
and
forty
cents
he
must
have
the
thing
counting
the
revolutions
of
all
four
wheels
he
walked
around
and
surveyed
my
expense
account
at
the
driver
elbow
then
he
hit
the
meter
a
smart
slap
but
the
figures
did
not
change
nineteen
dollars
he
repeated
dazed
nineteen
dollars
and
look
here
he
called
to
his
driver
who
had
brought
the
cab
close
only
thirty
cents
here
your
clock
ten
cents
fast
but
how
i
began
you
back
up
to
nineteen
dollars
and
thirty
cents
he
persisted
ignoring
me
if
you
back
up
to
twelve
dollars
i
pay
it
all
i
got
then
he
turned
on
me
irritably
good
heavens
man
he
exclaimed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
been
to
eight
this
sunday
evening
and
spent
nineteen
dollars
and
thirty
cents
and
got
a
drink
yet
do
you
think
i
after
a
drink
i
asked
him
now
look
here
davidson
i
rather
think
you
know
what
i
am
after
if
you
do
it
matter
but
since
you
are
coming
along
anyhow
pay
your
man
off
and
come
with
me
i
do
like
to
be
followed
he
agreed
without
hesitation
borrowed
eight
dollars
from
me
to
augment
his
twelve
and
crawled
in
with
me
the
next
address
on
the
list
is
the
right
one
he
said
as
the
man
waited
for
directions
i
did
the
same
round
yesterday
but
not
being
a
plutocrat
i
used
the
and
my
legs
and
because
you
a
decent
fellow
and
do
have
to
be
chloroformed
to
have
an
idea
injected
i
going
to
tell
you
something
there
were
eleven
roundsmen
as
well
as
the
sergeant
who
heard
me
read
the
note
i
found
at
the
fleming
house
that
night
you
may
have
counted
them
through
the
window
a
dozen
men
read
it
before
morning
when
the
news
of
fleming
mur
death
came
out
i
thought
this
fellow
carter
might
know
something
and
i
trailed
delia
through
this
mamie
brennan
when
i
got
there
i
found
tom
brannigan
and
four
other
detectives
sitting
in
the
parlor
and
miss
delia
in
a
blue
silk
waist
making
eyes
at
every
mother
son
of
them
i
laughed
in
spite
of
my
disappointment
davidson
leaned
forward
and
closed
the
window
at
the
driver
back
then
he
squared
around
and
faced
me
understand
me
knox
he
said
fleming
killed
himself
you
and
i
are
agreed
on
that
even
if
you
are
just
convinced
of
it
telling
you
and
better
let
it
drop
sir
under
his
quiet
manner
i
felt
a
threat
it
served
to
rouse
me
i
let
it
drop
when
i
through
with
it
i
asserted
and
got
out
my
list
of
addresses
you
let
it
drop
because
it
too
hot
to
hold
he
retorted
with
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
if
you
are
determined
to
know
about
carter
i
can
tell
you
everything
that
is
necessary
the
chauffeur
stopped
his
engine
with
an
exasperated
jerk
and
settled
down
in
his
seat
every
line
of
his
back
bristling
with
irritation
i
prefer
learning
from
carter
himself
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
produced
an
apple
from
the
pocket
of
his
coat
you
have
to
travel
some
to
do
it
son
he
said
carter
left
for
parts
unknown
last
night
taking
with
him
enough
money
to
keep
him
in
comfort
for
some
little
time
until
all
this
blows
over
i
said
bitterly
the
trip
was
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
he
has
been
suffering
and
is
still
suffering
from
a
curious
lapse
of
memory
davidson
smiled
at
me
engagingly
he
has
entirely
forgotten
everything
that
occurred
from
the
time
he
entered
fleming
employment
until
that
gentleman
left
home
i
doubt
if
he
will
ever
recover
with
carter
gone
his
retreat
covered
by
the
police
supplied
with
funds
from
some
problematical
source
further
search
for
him
was
worse
than
useless
in
fact
davidson
strongly
intimated
that
it
might
be
dangerous
and
would
be
certainly
unpleasant
i
yielded
ungraciously
and
ordered
the
cab
to
take
me
home
but
on
the
way
i
cursed
my
folly
for
not
having
followed
this
obvious
clue
earlier
and
i
wondered
what
this
thing
could
be
that
carter
knew
that
was
at
least
surmised
by
various
headquarters
men
and
yet
was
so
carefully
hidden
from
the
world
at
large
the
party
newspapers
had
come
out
that
day
with
a
signed
statement
from
fleming
physician
in
plattsburg
that
he
had
been
in
ill
health
and
inclined
to
melancholia
for
some
time
the
air
was
thick
with
rumors
of
differences
with
his
party
the
dust
cloud
covered
everything
pretty
soon
it
would
settle
and
hide
the
tracks
of
those
who
had
hurried
to
cover
under
its
protection
davidson
left
me
at
a
corner
he
turned
to
give
me
a
parting
admonition
there
an
old
axiom
in
the
mills
around
here
sit
down
on
a
piece
of
metal
until
you
spit
on
it
if
it
sizzles
do
sit
he
grinned
your
best
position
just
now
young
man
is
standing
with
your
hands
over
your
head
confidentially
there
ai
anything
within
expectorating
distance
just
now
that
ai
pretty
well
het
up
he
left
me
with
that
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
until
the
night
at
the
white
cat
when
he
helped
put
me
through
the
transom
recently
however
i
have
met
him
several
times
he
invariably
mentions
the
eight
dollars
and
his
intention
of
repaying
it
unfortunately
the
desire
and
the
ability
have
not
yet
happened
to
coincide
i
took
the
evening
train
to
bellwood
and
got
there
shortly
after
eight
in
the
midst
of
the
sunday
evening
calm
and
the
calm
of
a
place
like
bellwood
is
the
peace
of
death
without
the
hope
of
resurrection
i
walked
slowly
up
the
main
street
which
was
lined
with
residences
the
town
relegated
its
few
shops
to
less
desirable
neighborhoods
my
first
intention
had
been
to
see
the
episcopal
minister
but
the
rectory
was
dark
and
a
burst
of
organ
music
from
the
church
near
reminded
me
again
of
the
sunday
evening
services
promiscuous
inquiry
was
not
advisable
so
far
miss
jane
disappearance
was
known
to
very
few
and
hunter
had
advised
caution
i
wandered
up
the
street
and
turned
at
random
to
the
right
a
few
doors
ahead
a
newish
red
brick
building
proclaimed
itself
the
and
gave
the
only
sign
of
life
in
the
neighborhood
it
occurred
to
me
that
here
inside
was
the
one
individual
who
theoretically
at
least
in
a
small
place
always
knows
the
idiosyncrasies
of
its
people
the
door
was
partly
open
for
the
spring
night
was
sultry
the
postmaster
proved
to
be
a
veteran
of
the
civil
war
and
he
was
sorting
rapidly
the
contents
of
a
emptied
on
the
counter
no
delivery
he
said
shortly
sunday
delivery
two
to
three
i
suppose
then
i
could
get
a
dollar
worth
of
stamps
i
regretted
he
looked
up
over
his
glasses
we
do
sell
stamps
on
sunday
nights
he
explained
more
politely
but
if
you
in
a
hurry
for
them
i
am
i
lied
and
after
he
had
got
them
out
counting
them
with
a
wrinkled
finger
and
tearing
them
off
the
sheet
with
the
deliberation
of
age
i
opened
a
general
conversation
i
suppose
you
do
a
good
bit
of
business
here
i
asked
it
seems
like
a
thriving
place
not
so
bad
big
mail
here
sometimes
first
of
the
quarter
when
bills
are
coming
round
we
have
a
rush
and
holidays
and
easter
we
got
to
hire
an
express
wagon
it
was
when
i
asked
him
about
his
empty
sleeve
however
and
he
had
told
me
that
he
lost
his
arm
at
chancellorsville
that
we
became
really
friendly
when
he
said
he
had
been
a
corporal
in
general
command
my
path
was
one
of
ease
the
maitland
ladies
i
should
say
i
do
he
said
warmly
i
been
fighting
with
letitia
maitland
as
long
as
i
can
remember
that
woman
will
scrap
with
the
angel
gabriel
at
the
resurrection
if
he
wakes
her
up
before
she
had
her
sleep
out
miss
jane
is
not
that
sort
is
she
miss
jane
she
an
angel
she
is
that
she
could
have
been
married
a
dozen
times
when
she
was
a
girl
but
letitia
would
have
it
i
was
after
her
myself
years
ago
this
was
the
maitland
farm
in
those
days
and
my
father
kept
a
country
store
down
where
the
railroad
station
is
now
i
suppose
from
that
the
maitland
ladies
are
wealthy
wealthy
they
do
know
what
they
worth
not
that
it
matters
a
mite
to
jane
maitland
she
has
called
her
soul
her
own
for
so
long
that
i
guess
the
good
lord
wo
hold
her
responsible
for
it
all
of
which
was
entertaining
but
it
was
much
like
an
it
kept
going
but
it
did
make
much
progress
but
now
at
last
we
took
a
step
ahead
it
a
shameful
thing
the
old
man
pursued
that
a
woman
as
old
as
jane
should
have
to
get
her
letters
surreptitiously
for
more
than
a
year
now
she
been
coming
here
twice
a
week
for
her
mail
and
i
been
keeping
it
for
her
rain
or
shine
mondays
and
thursdays
she
been
coming
and
a
sight
of
letters
she
been
getting
too
did
she
come
last
thursday
i
asked
the
postmaster
all
at
once
regarded
me
with
suspicion
i
do
know
whether
she
did
or
not
he
said
coldly
and
my
further
attempts
to
beguile
him
into
conversation
failed
i
pocketed
my
stamps
and
by
that
time
his
resentment
at
my
curiosity
was
fading
he
followed
me
to
the
door
and
lowered
his
voice
cautiously
any
news
of
the
old
lady
he
asked
it
ai
generally
known
around
here
that
she
missing
but
heppie
the
cook
there
is
a
relation
of
my
wife
we
have
no
news
i
replied
and
do
let
it
get
around
will
you
he
promised
gravely
i
was
tellin
the
missus
the
other
day
he
said
that
there
is
an
old
cellar
under
the
maitland
place
have
you
looked
there
he
was
disappointed
when
i
said
we
had
and
i
was
about
to
go
when
he
called
me
back
miss
jane
did
get
her
mail
on
thursday
but
on
friday
that
niece
of
hers
came
for
it
two
letters
one
from
the
city
and
one
from
new
york
thanks
i
returned
and
went
out
into
the
quiet
street
i
walked
past
the
maitland
place
but
the
windows
were
dark
and
the
house
closed
haphazard
inquiry
being
out
of
the
question
i
took
the
ten
train
back
to
the
city
i
had
learned
little
enough
and
that
little
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
use
for
why
had
margery
gone
for
miss
jane
mail
the
little
lady
was
missing
and
why
did
miss
jane
carry
on
a
clandestine
correspondence
the
family
had
retired
when
i
got
home
except
fred
who
called
from
his
study
to
ask
for
a
rhyme
for
mosque
i
could
not
think
of
one
and
suggested
that
he
change
the
word
to
temple
at
two
he
banged
on
my
door
in
a
temper
said
he
had
changed
the
rhythm
to
fit
and
now
could
find
a
rhyme
for
temple
i
suggested
dimple
drowsily
whereat
he
kicked
the
panel
of
the
door
and
went
to
bed
chapter
xiv
a
walk
in
the
park
the
funeral
occurred
on
monday
it
was
an
ostentatious
affair
with
a
long
list
of
honorary
a
picked
corps
of
city
firemen
in
uniform
ranged
around
the
casket
and
enough
money
wasted
in
floral
pillows
and
sheaves
of
wheat
tied
with
purple
ribbon
to
have
given
all
the
hungry
children
in
town
a
square
meal
amid
all
this
state
margery
moved
stricken
and
isolated
she
went
to
the
cemetery
with
edith
miss
letitia
having
sent
a
message
that
having
never
broken
her
neck
to
see
the
man
living
she
was
going
to
do
it
to
see
him
dead
the
music
was
very
fine
and
the
eulogy
spoke
of
this
patriot
who
had
served
his
country
so
long
and
so
well
following
the
flag
fred
commented
under
his
breath
as
long
as
there
was
an
appropriation
attached
to
it
and
when
it
was
all
over
we
went
back
to
fred
until
the
fleming
house
could
be
put
into
order
again
it
was
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
margery
for
with
the
children
demanding
her
attention
and
applause
every
minute
she
had
no
time
to
be
blue
butler
arrived
that
day
which
made
fred
suspicious
that
plan
to
bring
her
far
antedated
his
consent
but
she
was
there
when
we
got
home
from
the
funeral
and
after
one
glimpse
at
her
thin
face
and
hollow
eyes
i
begged
edith
to
keep
her
away
from
margery
for
that
day
at
least
fortunately
butler
was
exhausted
by
her
journey
and
retired
to
her
room
almost
immediately
i
watched
her
slender
figure
go
up
the
stairs
and
with
her
black
trailing
gown
and
colorless
face
she
was
an
embodiment
of
all
that
is
lonely
and
helpless
fred
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
stood
looking
at
edith
and
me
i
tell
you
honey
he
declared
brought
into
a
cheerful
home
is
sufficient
cause
for
divorce
is
it
jack
she
is
ill
edith
maintained
valiantly
she
is
my
cousin
too
which
gives
her
some
claim
on
me
and
my
guest
which
gives
her
more
fred
said
solemnly
if
you
do
not
give
me
the
key
to
the
cellarette
i
shall
have
a
chill
and
let
me
beg
this
of
you
if
i
ever
get
tired
of
this
life
and
shuffle
off
my
mortality
in
a
lumber
yard
or
a
political
club
and
you
go
around
like
that
i
shall
haunt
you
i
swear
it
shuffle
off
i
dared
him
i
will
see
that
edith
is
cheerful
and
happy
from
somewhere
above
there
came
a
sudden
crash
followed
by
the
announcement
made
by
a
scared
housemaid
that
butler
had
fainted
fred
sniffed
as
edith
scurried
hipped
he
said
shortly
for
two
cents
i
go
up
and
give
her
a
good
whiff
of
ammonia
not
this
aromatic
stuff
but
the
genuine
article
that
would
make
her
sit
up
and
take
notice
upon
my
word
i
ca
think
what
possessed
edith
these
spineless
timid
women
are
leeches
on
one
sympathies
but
butler
was
really
ill
and
margery
insisted
on
looking
after
her
it
was
an
odd
coincidence
the
widow
of
one
state
treasurer
and
the
orphaned
daughter
of
his
successor
both
men
had
died
violent
deaths
in
each
case
when
a
boiling
under
the
political
lid
had
threatened
to
blow
it
off
the
boys
were
allowed
to
have
their
dinner
with
the
family
that
evening
in
honor
of
butler
arrival
and
it
was
a
riotous
meal
margery
got
back
a
little
of
her
color
as
i
sat
across
from
her
and
watched
her
expressions
change
from
sadness
to
resignation
and
even
gradually
to
amusement
at
the
boys
antics
i
wondered
just
how
much
she
knew
or
suspected
that
she
refused
to
tell
me
i
remembered
a
woman
a
client
of
mine
who
said
that
whenever
she
sat
near
a
railroad
track
and
watched
an
engine
thundering
toward
her
she
tortured
herself
by
picturing
a
child
on
the
track
and
wondering
whether
under
such
circumstances
she
would
risk
her
life
to
save
the
child
i
felt
a
good
bit
that
way
i
was
firmly
embarked
on
the
case
now
and
i
tortured
myself
with
one
idea
suppose
i
should
find
wardrop
guilty
and
i
should
find
extenuating
circumstances
what
would
i
do
publish
the
truth
see
him
hanged
or
imprisoned
and
break
margery
heart
or
keep
back
the
truth
let
her
marry
him
and
try
to
forget
that
i
had
had
a
hand
in
the
whole
wretched
business
after
all
i
decided
to
try
to
stop
my
imaginary
train
prove
wardrop
innocent
i
reasoned
with
myself
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing
and
then
it
would
be
man
and
man
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
i
suppose
my
proper
attitude
romantically
taken
was
to
consider
engagement
ring
an
indissoluble
barrier
but
this
was
not
romance
i
was
fighting
for
my
life
happiness
and
as
to
the
ring
well
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
if
a
man
really
loves
a
woman
and
thinks
he
can
make
her
happy
he
will
tell
her
so
if
she
is
strung
with
engagement
rings
to
the
ends
of
her
fingers
dangerous
doctrine
well
this
is
not
propaganda
tuesday
found
us
all
more
normal
butler
had
slept
some
and
very
commendably
allowed
herself
to
be
tea
and
toasted
in
bed
the
boys
were
started
to
kindergarten
after
ten
minutes
of
frenzied
margery
went
with
me
along
the
hall
when
i
started
for
the
office
you
have
not
learned
anything
she
asked
cautiously
glancing
back
to
edith
at
the
telephone
calling
the
grocer
frantically
for
the
monday
morning
supply
of
soap
and
starch
not
much
i
evaded
nothing
definite
anyhow
margery
you
are
not
going
back
to
the
monmouth
avenue
house
again
are
you
not
just
yet
i
do
think
i
could
i
suppose
later
it
will
have
to
be
sold
but
not
at
once
i
shall
go
to
aunt
letitia
first
very
well
i
said
then
you
are
going
to
take
a
walk
with
me
this
afternoon
in
the
park
i
wo
take
no
you
need
the
exercise
and
i
need
to
talk
to
you
i
finished
lamely
when
she
had
agreed
i
went
to
the
office
it
was
not
much
after
nine
but
to
my
surprise
burton
was
already
there
he
had
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
miss
grant
the
stenographer
and
that
usually
frigid
person
had
melted
under
the
warmth
of
his
red
hair
and
his
smile
she
was
telling
him
about
her
sister
baby
having
the
when
i
went
in
i
wish
i
had
studied
law
he
threw
at
me
shall
it
profit
a
man
to
become
a
lawyer
and
lose
his
own
soul
as
the
psalmist
says
i
like
this
business
when
we
had
gone
into
the
inner
office
and
shut
out
miss
grant
and
the
he
was
serious
instantly
well
he
said
sitting
on
the
radiator
and
dangling
his
foot
i
guess
we
got
wardrop
for
theft
anyhow
theft
i
inquired
well
larceny
if
you
prefer
legal
terms
i
found
where
he
sold
the
pearls
in
plattsburg
to
a
wholesale
jeweler
named
suggestively
cashdollar
then
i
said
conclusively
if
he
took
the
pearls
and
sold
them
as
sure
as
i
sit
here
he
took
the
money
out
of
that
russia
leather
bag
burton
swung
his
foot
rhythmically
against
the
pipes
i
not
so
darned
sure
of
it
he
said
calmly
if
he
had
any
reason
he
refused
to
give
it
i
told
him
in
my
turn
of
carter
escape
aided
by
the
police
and
he
smiled
for
a
suicide
causing
a
lot
of
excitement
he
remarked
when
i
told
him
the
little
incident
of
the
he
was
much
interested
the
old
lady
in
it
somehow
he
maintained
she
may
have
been
lending
fleming
money
for
one
thing
how
do
you
know
it
was
her
hundred
thousand
that
was
stolen
i
do
think
she
ever
had
the
uncontrolled
disposal
of
a
dollar
in
her
life
there
only
one
thing
to
do
burton
said
finally
and
that
is
find
miss
jane
if
she
alive
she
can
tell
something
i
stake
my
fountain
pen
on
that
and
it
my
dearest
possession
on
earth
next
to
my
mother
if
miss
jane
is
dead
well
somebody
killed
her
and
time
it
was
being
found
out
it
easy
enough
to
say
find
her
it
easy
enough
to
find
her
he
exploded
make
a
noise
about
it
send
up
rockets
put
a
ad
in
every
paper
in
town
or
better
still
give
the
story
to
the
reporters
and
let
them
find
her
for
you
i
do
it
if
i
was
tied
up
with
this
fleming
case
describe
her
how
she
walked
what
she
liked
to
eat
what
she
wore
in
this
case
what
she
did
wear
lord
i
wish
i
had
that
assignment
in
hours
she
will
have
been
seen
in
a
hundred
different
places
and
one
of
them
will
be
right
it
will
be
a
question
of
selection
that
is
if
she
is
alive
in
spite
of
his
airy
tone
i
knew
he
was
serious
and
i
felt
he
was
right
the
publicity
part
of
it
i
left
to
him
and
i
sent
a
special
delivery
that
morning
to
bellwood
asking
miss
letitia
to
say
nothing
and
to
refer
reporters
to
me
i
had
already
been
besieged
with
them
since
my
connection
with
the
fleming
case
and
a
few
more
made
no
difference
burton
attended
to
the
matter
thoroughly
the
one
edition
of
an
afternoon
paper
contained
a
short
and
vivid
scarlet
account
of
miss
jane
disappearance
the
evening
editions
were
full
and
while
vague
as
to
the
manner
of
her
leaving
were
minute
as
regarded
her
personal
appearance
and
characteristics
to
escape
the
threatened
inundation
of
the
morning
paper
men
i
left
the
office
early
and
at
four
margery
and
i
stepped
from
a
hill
car
into
the
park
she
had
been
wearing
a
short
veil
but
once
away
from
the
gaze
of
the
curious
she
took
it
off
i
was
glad
to
see
she
had
lost
the
air
of
detachment
she
had
worn
for
the
last
three
days
hold
your
shoulders
well
back
i
directed
when
we
had
found
an
isolated
path
and
take
long
breaths
try
breathing
in
while
i
count
ten
she
was
very
tractable
unusually
so
i
imagined
for
her
we
swung
along
together
for
almost
a
hardly
talking
i
was
content
merely
to
be
with
her
and
the
sheer
joy
of
the
exercise
after
her
enforced
confinement
kept
her
silent
when
she
began
to
flag
a
little
i
found
a
bench
and
we
sat
down
together
the
bench
had
been
lately
painted
and
although
it
seemed
dry
enough
i
spread
my
handkerchief
for
her
to
sit
on
whereupon
she
called
me
sir
walter
and
at
the
familiar
jest
we
laughed
like
a
pair
of
children
i
had
made
the
stipulation
that
for
this
one
time
her
father
death
and
her
other
troubles
should
be
taboo
and
we
adhered
to
it
religiously
a
robin
in
the
path
was
industriously
digging
out
a
worm
he
had
tackled
a
long
one
and
it
was
all
he
could
manage
he
took
the
available
end
in
his
beak
and
hopped
back
with
the
expression
of
one
who
sets
his
jaws
and
determines
that
this
which
should
be
is
to
be
the
worm
stretched
into
a
pinkish
and
attenuated
line
but
it
neither
broke
nor
gave
horrid
thing
margery
said
that
is
a
disgraceful
heartless
exhibition
the
robin
is
a
parent
i
reminded
her
it
is
precisely
the
same
as
fred
who
twists
jerks
distorts
and
attenuates
the
english
language
in
his
magazine
work
in
order
to
have
bread
and
and
jelly
cake
for
his
two
blooming
youngsters
she
had
taken
off
her
gloves
and
sat
with
her
hands
loosely
clasped
in
her
lap
i
wish
some
one
depended
on
me
she
said
pensively
it
a
terrible
thing
to
feel
that
it
does
matter
to
any
one
not
vitally
anyhow
whether
one
is
around
or
not
to
have
all
my
responsibilities
taken
away
at
once
and
just
to
drift
around
like
this
oh
dreadful
you
were
going
to
be
good
i
reminded
her
i
did
promise
to
be
cheerful
she
returned
besides
my
father
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
world
who
cared
about
me
and
i
know
where
she
is
dear
aunt
jane
the
sunlight
caught
the
ring
on
her
engagement
finger
and
she
flushed
suddenly
as
she
saw
me
looking
at
it
we
sat
there
for
a
while
saying
nothing
the
long
may
afternoon
was
coming
to
a
close
the
paths
began
to
fill
with
long
lines
of
hurrying
their
day
in
office
or
factory
at
an
end
margery
got
up
at
last
and
buttoned
her
coat
then
impulsively
she
held
out
her
hand
to
me
you
have
been
more
than
kind
to
me
she
said
hurriedly
you
have
taken
me
into
your
home
and
helped
me
through
these
dreadful
days
and
i
will
never
forget
it
never
i
am
not
virtuous
i
replied
looking
down
at
her
i
could
help
it
you
walked
into
my
life
when
you
came
to
my
office
was
it
only
last
week
the
evil
days
are
coming
i
suppose
but
just
now
nothing
matters
at
all
save
that
you
are
you
and
i
am
i
she
dropped
her
veil
quickly
and
we
went
back
to
the
car
the
prosaic
world
wrapped
us
around
again
there
was
a
heavy
odor
of
restaurant
coffee
in
the
air
people
bumped
and
jolted
past
us
to
me
they
were
only
shadows
the
real
world
was
a
girl
in
black
and
myself
and
the
girl
wore
a
betrothal
ring
which
was
not
mine
chapter
xv
find
the
woman
butler
came
down
to
dinner
that
night
she
was
more
cheerful
than
i
had
yet
seen
her
and
she
had
changed
her
mournful
garments
to
something
a
trifle
less
depressing
with
her
masses
of
fair
hair
dressed
high
and
her
face
slightly
animated
i
realized
what
i
had
not
done
before
that
she
was
the
wreck
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
frail
as
she
was
almost
shrinkingly
timid
in
her
manner
there
were
times
when
she
drew
up
her
tall
figure
in
something
like
its
former
stateliness
she
had
beautiful
eyebrows
nearly
black
and
perfectly
penciled
they
were
almost
incongruous
in
her
colorless
face
she
was
very
weak
she
used
a
cane
when
she
walked
and
after
dinner
in
the
library
she
was
content
to
sit
impassive
detached
propped
with
cushions
while
margery
read
to
the
boys
in
their
night
nursery
and
edith
embroidered
fred
had
been
fussing
over
a
play
for
some
time
and
he
had
gone
to
read
it
to
some
manager
or
other
edith
was
already
spending
the
royalties
we
could
go
a
little
ways
out
of
town
she
was
saying
and
we
could
have
an
automobile
margery
says
theirs
will
be
sold
and
it
will
certainly
be
a
bargain
jack
are
you
laughing
at
me
certainly
i
replied
gravely
dream
on
edith
shall
we
train
the
boys
as
chauffeurs
or
shall
we
buy
in
the
fleming
man
also
cheap
i
am
sure
edith
said
aggrieved
that
it
costs
more
for
horse
feed
this
minute
for
your
gray
jack
than
it
would
for
gasolene
but
lady
gray
wo
eat
gasolene
i
protested
she
does
like
it
edith
turned
her
back
on
me
and
sewed
near
me
butler
had
languidly
taken
up
the
paper
suddenly
she
dropped
it
and
when
i
stooped
and
picked
it
up
i
noticed
she
was
trembling
is
it
true
she
demanded
is
robert
clarkson
dead
yes
i
assented
he
has
been
dead
since
sunday
morning
a
suicide
edith
had
risen
and
come
over
to
her
but
butler
was
not
fainting
i
glad
glad
she
said
then
she
grew
weak
and
laughing
and
crying
in
the
same
breath
when
she
had
been
helped
for
in
her
weakened
state
it
had
been
more
of
a
shock
than
we
realized
margery
came
down
and
we
tried
to
forget
the
scene
we
had
just
gone
through
i
am
glad
fred
was
not
here
edith
confided
to
me
ellen
is
a
lovely
woman
and
as
kind
as
she
is
mild
but
in
one
of
her
attacks
she
is
a
little
bit
trying
it
was
strange
to
contrast
the
way
in
which
the
two
women
took
their
similar
bereavements
margery
represented
the
best
type
of
normal
american
womanhood
ellen
butler
the
neurasthenic
she
demanded
everything
by
her
very
helplessness
and
timidity
she
was
a
constant
drain
on
edith
ready
sympathy
that
night
while
i
closed
the
house
fred
had
not
come
in
i
advised
her
to
let
butler
go
back
to
her
sanatorium
at
i
was
still
fred
was
out
and
i
waited
for
him
being
curious
to
know
the
verdict
on
the
play
the
bell
rang
a
few
minutes
before
one
and
i
went
to
the
door
some
one
in
the
vestibule
was
tapping
the
floor
impatiently
with
his
foot
when
i
opened
the
door
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
late
visitor
was
wardrop
he
came
in
quietly
and
i
had
a
chance
to
see
him
well
under
the
hall
light
the
change
three
days
had
made
was
shocking
his
eyes
were
sunk
deep
in
his
head
his
reddened
lids
and
twitching
mouth
told
of
little
sleep
of
nerves
ready
to
snap
he
was
untidy
too
and
a
three
beard
hardly
improved
him
i
glad
it
you
he
said
by
way
of
greeting
i
was
afraid
have
gone
to
bed
it
the
top
of
the
evening
yet
i
replied
perfunctorily
as
i
led
the
way
into
the
library
once
inside
wardrop
closed
the
door
and
looked
around
him
like
an
animal
at
bay
i
came
here
he
said
nervously
looking
at
the
windows
because
i
had
an
idea
you
keep
your
head
mine
gone
i
either
crazy
or
i
on
my
way
there
sit
down
man
i
pushed
a
chair
to
him
you
do
look
as
if
you
have
been
in
bed
for
a
couple
of
nights
he
went
to
each
of
the
windows
and
examined
the
closed
shutters
before
he
answered
me
i
have
you
would
go
to
bed
either
if
you
thought
you
would
never
wake
up
nonsense
well
it
true
enough
knox
there
are
people
following
me
wherever
i
go
they
eat
where
i
eat
if
i
doze
in
my
chair
they
come
into
my
dreams
he
stopped
there
then
he
laughed
a
little
wildly
that
last
is
sane
but
it
true
there
a
man
across
the
street
now
eating
an
apple
under
a
lamppost
suppose
you
under
surveillance
i
said
it
annoying
to
have
a
detective
following
you
around
but
it
hardly
serious
the
police
say
now
that
fleming
killed
himself
that
was
your
own
contention
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
resting
his
hands
on
his
knees
gazed
at
me
somberly
suppose
i
say
he
did
kill
himself
slowly
suppose
i
say
he
was
murdered
suppose
good
god
suppose
i
killed
him
myself
i
drew
back
in
stupefaction
but
he
hurried
on
for
the
last
two
days
i
been
wondering
if
i
did
it
he
had
any
weapon
i
had
one
his
i
hated
him
that
day
i
had
tried
to
save
him
and
could
my
god
knox
i
might
have
gone
off
my
head
and
done
it
and
not
remember
it
there
have
been
cases
like
that
his
condition
was
pitiable
i
looked
around
for
some
whisky
but
the
best
i
could
do
was
a
little
port
on
the
sideboard
when
i
came
back
he
was
sitting
with
bent
head
his
forehead
on
his
palms
i
thought
it
all
out
he
said
painfully
my
mother
had
spells
of
emotional
insanity
perhaps
i
went
there
without
knowing
it
and
killed
him
i
can
see
him
in
the
night
when
i
dare
sleep
toppling
over
on
to
that
table
with
a
bullet
wound
in
his
head
and
i
am
in
the
room
and
i
have
his
revolver
in
my
pocket
you
give
me
your
word
you
have
no
conscious
recollection
of
hearing
a
shot
fired
my
word
before
heaven
he
said
fervently
but
i
tell
you
knox
he
had
no
weapon
no
one
came
out
of
that
room
as
i
went
in
and
yet
he
was
only
swaying
forward
as
if
i
had
shot
him
one
moment
and
caught
him
as
he
fell
the
next
i
was
dazed
i
do
remember
yet
what
i
told
the
police
the
expression
of
fear
in
his
eyes
was
terrible
to
see
a
gust
of
wind
shook
the
shutters
and
he
jumped
almost
out
of
his
chair
you
will
have
to
be
careful
i
said
there
have
been
cases
where
men
confessed
murders
they
never
committed
driven
by
heaven
knows
what
method
of
undermining
their
mental
resistance
yon
expose
your
imagination
to
degree
torture
of
your
own
invention
and
in
two
days
more
you
will
be
able
to
add
full
details
of
the
crime
i
knew
you
would
think
me
crazy
he
put
in
a
little
less
somberly
but
just
try
it
once
sit
in
a
room
by
yourself
all
day
and
all
night
with
detectives
watching
you
sit
there
and
puzzle
over
a
murder
of
a
man
you
are
suspected
of
killing
you
know
you
felt
like
killing
him
and
you
have
a
revolver
and
he
is
shot
would
you
begin
to
think
as
i
do
wardrop
i
asked
trying
to
fix
his
wavering
eyes
with
mine
do
you
own
a
caliber
revolver
yes
i
was
startled
beyond
any
necessity
under
the
circumstances
many
people
have
that
is
i
had
he
corrected
himself
it
was
in
the
leather
bag
that
was
stolen
at
bellwood
i
can
relieve
your
mind
of
one
thing
i
said
if
your
revolver
was
stolen
with
the
leather
bag
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
fleming
was
shot
with
a
he
looked
first
incredulous
then
relieved
now
then
i
pursued
suppose
fleming
had
an
enemy
a
relentless
one
who
would
stoop
to
anything
to
compass
his
ruin
in
his
position
he
would
be
likely
to
have
enemies
this
person
let
us
say
knows
what
you
carry
in
your
grip
and
steals
it
taking
away
the
funds
that
would
have
helped
to
keep
the
lid
on
fleming
mismanagement
for
a
time
in
the
grip
is
your
revolver
would
you
know
it
again
he
nodded
affirmatively
this
person
this
enemy
finds
the
revolver
pockets
it
and
at
the
first
opportunity
having
ruined
fleming
proceeds
humanely
to
put
him
out
of
his
suffering
is
it
there
were
a
dozen
a
hundred
people
who
would
have
been
glad
to
ruin
him
his
gaze
wavered
again
suddenly
it
was
evident
that
i
had
renewed
an
old
train
of
thought
for
instance
i
suggested
but
he
was
on
guard
again
you
forget
one
thing
knox
he
said
after
a
moment
there
was
nobody
else
who
could
have
shot
him
the
room
was
empty
nonsense
i
replied
do
forget
the
warehouse
the
warehouse
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
he
was
shot
from
there
he
was
facing
the
open
window
sitting
directly
under
the
light
writing
a
shot
fired
through
a
broken
pane
of
one
of
the
warehouse
windows
would
meet
every
requirement
of
the
case
the
empty
room
the
absence
of
powder
marks
even
the
fact
that
no
shot
was
heard
there
was
a
report
of
course
but
the
noise
in
the
and
the
outside
covered
it
by
george
he
exclaimed
the
warehouse
of
course
i
never
thought
of
it
he
was
relieved
for
some
reason
it
a
question
now
of
how
many
people
knew
he
was
at
the
club
and
which
of
them
hated
him
enough
to
kill
him
clarkson
knew
it
wardrop
said
but
he
did
do
it
why
because
it
was
he
who
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
while
the
detective
and
you
and
i
were
inside
and
called
fleming
i
pulled
out
my
and
took
out
the
scrap
of
paper
which
margery
had
found
pinned
to
the
pillow
in
her
father
bedroom
do
you
know
what
that
means
i
asked
watching
wardrop
face
that
was
found
in
fleming
room
two
days
after
he
left
home
a
similar
scrap
was
found
in
miss
jane
maitland
room
when
she
disappeared
when
fleming
was
murdered
he
was
writing
a
letter
he
said
figures
have
followed
me
here
when
we
know
what
those
figures
mean
wardrop
we
know
why
he
was
killed
and
who
did
it
he
shook
his
head
hopelessly
i
do
not
know
he
said
and
i
believed
him
he
had
got
up
and
taken
his
hat
but
i
stopped
him
inside
the
door
you
can
help
this
thing
in
two
ways
i
told
him
i
am
going
to
give
you
something
to
do
you
will
have
less
time
to
be
morbid
find
out
if
you
can
all
about
fleming
private
life
in
the
last
dozen
years
especially
the
last
three
see
if
there
are
any
women
mixed
up
in
it
and
try
to
find
out
something
about
this
eleven
eleven
he
repeated
but
i
had
not
missed
his
change
of
expression
when
i
said
women
also
i
went
on
i
want
you
to
tell
me
who
was
with
you
the
night
you
tried
to
break
into
the
house
at
bellwood
he
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
when
he
had
gathered
himself
together
his
perplexity
was
overdone
with
me
he
repeated
i
was
alone
of
course
i
mean
the
woman
at
the
gate
he
lost
his
composure
altogether
then
i
put
my
back
against
the
door
and
waited
for
him
to
get
himself
in
hand
there
was
a
woman
i
persisted
and
what
is
more
wardrop
at
this
minute
you
believe
she
took
your
russia
leather
bag
and
left
a
substitute
he
fell
into
the
trap
but
she
could
he
quavered
i
thought
until
my
brain
is
going
and
i
do
see
how
she
could
have
done
it
he
became
sullen
when
he
saw
what
he
had
done
refused
any
more
information
and
left
almost
immediately
fred
came
soon
after
and
in
the
meantime
i
had
made
some
notes
like
this
examine
warehouse
and
yard

to

chapter
xvi
eleven
again
burton
idea
of
exploiting
miss
jane
disappearance
began
to
bear
fruit
the
next
morning
i
went
to
the
office
early
anxious
to
get
my
more
pressing
business
out
of
the
way
to
have
the
afternoon
with
burton
to
inspect
the
warehouse
at
nine
came
a
call
from
the
morgue
small
woman
well
dressed
gray
hair
i
repeated
i
think
i
go
up
and
see
where
was
the
body
found
in
the
river
at
monica
station
was
the
reply
there
is
a
scar
diagonally
across
the
cheek
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
a
fresh
injury
no
an
old
scar
with
a
breath
of
relief
i
said
it
was
not
the
person
we
were
seeking
and
tried
to
get
down
to
work
again
but
burton
prophecy
had
been
right
miss
jane
had
been
seen
in
a
hundred
different
places
one
perhaps
was
right
which
one
a
reporter
for
the
had
been
working
on
the
case
all
night
he
came
in
for
a
more
detailed
description
of
the
missing
woman
and
he
had
a
theory
to
fit
which
he
was
quite
ready
to
cut
and
trim
the
facts
it
rowe
he
said
confidently
you
can
see
his
hand
in
it
right
through
i
was
put
on
the
benson
kidnapping
case
you
remember
the
boy
who
was
kept
for
three
months
in
a
deserted
lumber
camp
in
the
mountains
well
sir
every
person
in
the
benson
house
swore
that
youngster
was
in
bed
at
midnight
when
the
house
was
closed
for
the
night
every
door
and
window
bolted
in
the
morning
and
the
boy
gone
when
we
found
rowe
after
the
mother
had
put
on
mourning
and
found
the
kid
ten
pounds
heavier
than
he
had
been
before
he
was
abducted
and
strutting
around
like
a
turkey
cock
rowe
told
us
that
he
and
the
boy
took
in
the
theater
that
night
and
were
there
for
the
first
act
how
did
he
do
it
he
offered
to
take
the
boy
to
the
show
if
he
would
pretend
to
go
to
bed
and
then
slide
down
a
porch
pillar
and
meet
him
the
boy
did
want
to
go
home
when
we
found
him
there
ca
be
any
mistake
about
the
time
in
this
case
i
commented
i
saw
her
myself
after
eleven
and
said
good
night
the
man
consulted
his
oh
yes
he
asked
did
she
have
a
diagonal
cut
across
her
cheek
no
i
said
for
the
second
time
my
next
visitor
was
a
cabman
on
the
night
in
question
he
had
taken
a
small
and
a
very
nervous
old
woman
to
the
omega
ferry
she
appeared
excited
and
almost
forgot
to
pay
him
she
carried
a
small
satchel
and
wore
a
black
veil
what
did
she
look
like
she
had
gray
hair
and
she
seemed
to
have
a
scar
on
her
face
that
drew
the
corner
of
her
mouth
at
ten
i
telephoned
burton
for
heaven
sake
i
said
if
anybody
has
lost
a
little
old
lady
in
a
black
dress
wearing
a
black
veil
carrying
a
satchel
and
with
a
scar
diagonally
across
her
cheek
from
her
eye
to
her
mouth
i
can
tell
them
all
about
her
and
where
she
is
now
that
funny
he
said
we
stirring
up
the
pool
and
bringing
up
things
we
did
expect
the
police
have
been
looking
for
that
woman
quietly
for
a
week
she
the
widow
of
a
coal
baron
and
her
under
suspicion
of
making
away
with
her
well
he
did
i
affirmed
she
committed
suicide
from
an
omega
ferry
boat
and
she
at
the
morgue
this
morning
bully
he
returned
keep
on
you
get
lots
of
clues
and
remember
one
will
be
right
it
was
not
until
noon
however
that
anything
concrete
developed
in
the
two
hours
between
i
had
interviewed
seven
more
people
i
had
followed
the
depressing
last
hours
of
the
coal
baron
widow
and
jumped
with
her
mentally
into
the
black
river
that
night
i
had
learned
of
a
small
girl
who
had
tried
to
buy
cyanide
of
potassium
at
three
on
the
same
street
and
of
a
tall
light
woman
who
had
taken
a
room
for
three
days
at
a
hotel
and
was
apparently
demented
at
twelve
however
my
reward
came
two
men
walked
in
almost
at
the
same
time
one
was
a
motorman
in
his
official
clothes
brass
buttons
and
patches
around
the
pockets
the
other
was
a
taxicab
driver
both
had
the
uncertain
gait
of
men
who
by
occupation
are
unused
to
anything
stationary
under
them
and
each
eyed
the
other
suspiciously
the
motorman
claimed
priority
by
a
nose
so
i
took
him
first
into
my
private
office
his
story
shorn
of
his
own
opinions
at
the
time
and
later
was
as
follows
on
the
night
in
question
thursday
of
the
week
before
he
took
his
car
out
of
the
barn
for
the
eleven
run
barney
was
his
conductor
they
went
from
the
barn
at
hays
street
and
then
started
out
for
wynton
the
controller
blew
out
and
two
or
three
things
went
wrong
all
told
they
lost
forty
minutes
they
got
to
wynton
at
five
minutes
after
two
their
time
there
was
the
car
went
to
the
bad
again
at
wynton
and
he
and
barney
tinkered
with
it
until
they
got
it
in
shape
to
go
back
to
the
barn
but
that
was
all
just
as
they
were
ready
to
start
a
passenger
got
on
a
woman
alone
a
small
woman
with
a
brown
veil
she
wore
a
black
dress
or
a
suit
he
was
vague
about
everything
but
the
color
and
he
noticed
her
especially
because
she
was
fidgety
and
excited
half
a
block
farther
a
man
boarded
the
car
and
sat
across
from
the
woman
barney
said
afterward
that
the
man
tried
twice
to
speak
to
the
woman
but
she
looked
away
each
time
no
he
had
heard
what
he
said
the
man
got
out
when
the
car
went
into
the
barn
but
the
woman
stayed
on
he
and
barney
got
another
car
and
took
it
out
and
the
woman
went
with
them
she
made
a
complete
round
trip
this
time
going
out
to
wynton
and
back
to
the
end
of
the
line
it
was
just
daylight
when
she
got
off
at
last
at
first
and
day
streets
asked
if
he
had
thought
at
the
time
that
the
veiled
woman
was
young
or
old
he
said
he
had
thought
she
was
probably
very
young
or
very
old
women
would
not
put
in
the
night
riding
in
a
yes
he
had
had
men
who
rode
around
a
couple
of
times
at
night
mostly
to
sober
up
before
they
went
home
but
he
never
saw
a
woman
do
it
before
i
took
his
name
and
address
and
thanked
him
the
chauffeur
came
next
and
his
story
was
equally
pertinent
on
the
night
of
the
previous
thursday
he
had
been
engaged
to
take
a
sick
woman
from
a
hotel
to
a
house
at
bellwood
the
woman
husband
was
with
her
and
they
went
slowly
to
avoid
jolting
it
was
after
twelve
when
he
drove
away
from
the
house
and
started
home
at
a
corner
he
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
streets
a
woman
hailed
the
cab
and
asked
him
if
he
belonged
in
bellwood
or
was
going
to
the
city
she
had
missed
the
last
train
when
he
told
her
he
was
going
into
town
she
promptly
engaged
him
and
showed
him
where
to
wait
for
her
a
narrow
road
off
the
main
street
i
waited
an
hour
he
finished
before
she
came
i
dropped
to
sleep
or
i
would
have
gone
without
her
about
one
she
came
along
and
a
gentleman
with
her
he
put
her
in
the
cab
and
i
took
her
to
the
city
when
i
saw
in
the
paper
that
a
lady
had
disappeared
from
bellwood
that
night
i
knew
right
off
that
it
was
my
party
would
you
know
the
man
again
i
would
know
his
voice
i
expect
sir
i
could
not
see
much
he
wore
a
slouch
hat
and
had
a
of
some
kind
what
did
he
say
to
the
woman
i
asked
he
did
say
much
before
he
closed
the
door
he
said
have
put
me
in
a
terrible
position
or
something
like
that
from
the
and
all
i
thought
perhaps
it
was
an
elopement
and
the
lady
had
decided
to
throw
him
down
was
it
a
young
woman
or
an
old
one
i
asked
again
this
time
the
cabby
tone
was
assured
young
he
asserted
slim
and
quick
dressed
in
black
with
a
black
veil
soft
voice
she
got
out
at
market
square
and
i
have
an
idea
she
took
a
car
there
i
hardly
think
it
was
miss
maitland
i
said
she
was
past
sixty
and
besides
i
do
think
she
went
that
way
still
it
is
worth
following
up
is
that
all
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
after
a
minute
brought
up
a
small
black
and
held
it
out
to
me
it
was
the
small
coin
purse
out
of
a
leather
she
dropped
this
in
the
cab
sir
he
said
i
took
it
home
to
the
missus
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
it
it
had
no
money
in
it
only
that
bit
of
paper
i
opened
the
purse
and
took
out
a
small
white
card
without
engraving
on
it
was
written
in
a
pencil
the
figures
c
chapter
xvii
his
second
wife
when
the
cabman
had
gone
i
sat
down
and
tried
to
think
things
out
as
i
have
said
many
times
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
i
lack
imagination
moreover
a
long
experience
of
witnesses
in
court
had
taught
me
the
unreliability
of
average
observation
the
very
fact
that
two
men
swore
to
having
taken
solitary
women
away
from
bellwood
that
night
made
me
doubt
if
either
one
had
really
seen
the
missing
woman
of
the
two
stories
the
taxicab
driver
was
the
more
probable
as
far
as
miss
jane
was
concerned
knowing
her
nature
her
timidity
her
shrinking
and
shamefaced
fear
of
the
dark
it
was
almost
incredible
that
she
would
walk
the
three
miles
to
wynton
voluntarily
and
from
there
lose
herself
in
the
city
besides
such
an
explanation
would
not
fit
the
or
the
fact
that
she
had
gone
as
far
as
we
could
find
out
in
her
still
she
had
left
the
village
that
night
either
by
cab
or
on
foot
if
the
driver
had
been
correct
in
his
time
however
the
taxicab
was
almost
eliminated
he
said
the
woman
got
into
the
cab
at
it
was
between
and
when
margery
heard
the
footsteps
in
the
attic
i
think
for
the
first
time
it
came
to
me
that
day
that
there
was
at
least
a
possibility
that
miss
jane
had
not
been
attacked
robbed
or
injured
that
she
had
left
home
voluntarily
under
stress
of
great
excitement
but
if
she
had
why
the
mystery
was
hardly
less
for
being
stripped
of
its
gruesome
details
nothing
in
my
knowledge
of
the
missing
woman
gave
me
a
clue
i
had
a
vague
hope
that
if
she
had
gone
voluntarily
she
would
see
the
newspapers
and
let
us
know
where
she
was
to
my
list
of
exhibits
i
added
the
purse
with
its
inclosure
the
secret
drawer
of
my
desk
now
contained
besides
the
purse
the
slip
marked
eleven
that
had
been
pinned
to
fleming
pillow
the
similar
scrap
found
over
miss
jane
mantel
the
pearl
i
had
found
on
the
floor
of
the
closet
and
the
cyanide
which
as
well
as
the
bullet
burton
had
given
me
add
to
these
the
still
tender
place
on
my
head
where
wardrop
had
almost
brained
me
with
a
chair
and
a
blue
ankle
now
becoming
spotted
with
yellow
where
i
had
fallen
down
the
and
my
list
of
visible
reminders
of
the
double
mystery
grew
to
eight
i
was
not
proud
of
the
part
i
had
played
so
far
i
had
blundered
it
seemed
to
me
at
every
point
where
a
blunder
was
possible
i
had
fallen
over
folding
chairs
and
down
a
shaft
i
had
been
a
too
late
to
save
allan
fleming
i
had
been
up
and
awake
and
miss
jane
had
got
out
of
the
house
under
my
very
nose
last
and
by
no
means
least
i
had
waited
years
to
find
the
right
woman
and
when
i
found
her
some
one
else
had
won
her
i
was
in
the
depths
that
day
when
burton
came
in
he
walked
into
the
office
jauntily
and
presented
miss
grant
with
a
club
sandwich
neatly
done
up
in
waxed
paper
then
he
came
into
my
private
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
avaunt
dull
care
he
exclaimed
taking
in
my
dejected
attitude
and
exhibits
on
the
desk
at
a
glance
look
up
and
grin
my
friend
he
had
his
hands
behind
him
do
be
a
fool
i
snapped
i
not
grin
unless
i
feel
like
it
grin
darn
you
he
said
and
put
something
on
the
desk
in
front
of
me
it
was
a
russia
leather
bag
leather
bag
he
pointed
proudly
where
did
you
get
it
i
exclaimed
incredulous
burton
fumbled
with
the
lock
while
he
explained
it
was
found
in
boston
he
said
how
do
you
open
the
thing
anyhow
it
was
not
locked
and
i
got
it
open
in
a
minute
as
i
had
expected
it
was
empty
then
perhaps
wardrop
was
telling
the
truth
i
exclaimed
by
jove
burton
he
was
robbed
by
the
woman
in
the
cab
and
he
ca
tell
about
her
on
account
of
miss
fleming
she
made
a
haul
for
certain
i
told
him
then
of
the
two
women
who
had
left
bellwood
on
the
night
of
miss
jane
disappearance
and
showed
him
the
purse
and
its
inclosure
the
c
puzzled
him
as
it
had
me
it
might
be
anything
he
said
as
he
gave
it
back
from
a
book
chapter
and
verse
in
the
bible
to
a
prescription
for
rheumatism
at
a
as
to
the
lady
in
the
cab
i
think
perhaps
you
are
right
he
said
examining
the
interior
of
the
bag
where
wardrop
name
in
ink
told
its
story
of
course
we
have
only
wardrop
word
that
he
brought
the
bag
to
bellwood
if
we
grant
that
we
can
grant
the
rest
that
he
was
robbed
that
the
thief
emptied
the
bag
and
either
took
it
or
shipped
it
to
boston
how
on
earth
did
you
get
it
it
was
a
coincidence
there
have
been
a
shrewd
lot
of
baggage
thieves
in
two
or
three
eastern
cities
lately
mostly
boston
the
method
the
police
say
was
something
like
this
one
of
them
the
chief
of
the
gang
would
get
a
wagon
dress
like
an
expressman
and
go
round
the
depots
looking
at
baggage
he
would
make
a
mental
note
of
the
numbers
go
away
and
forge
a
check
to
match
and
secure
the
pieces
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
then
he
merely
drove
around
to
headquarters
and
the
trunk
was
rifled
the
police
got
on
raided
the
place
and
found
among
others
our
russia
leather
bag
it
was
shipped
back
empty
to
the
address
inside
at
bellwood
at
bellwood
then
how
it
came
while
i
was
lunching
with
miss
letitia
he
said
easily
very
chummy
thick
as
thieves
what
i
want
to
know
is
disregarding
my
astonishment
where
is
the
hundred
thousand
find
the
woman
did
you
ever
hear
of
anderson
the
nerve
specialist
he
asked
without
apparent
relevancy
i
have
been
thinking
of
him
i
answered
if
we
could
get
wardrop
there
on
some
plausible
excuse
it
would
take
anderson
about
ten
minutes
with
his
instruments
and
experimental
psychology
to
know
everything
wardrop
ever
forgot
i
go
on
one
condition
burton
said
preparing
to
leave
promise
to
get
wardrop
and
have
him
on
the
spot
at
two
if
you
promise
me
one
thing
if
anderson
fixes
me
with
his
eye
and
i
begin
to
look
dotty
and
tell
about
my
past
life
i
want
you
to
take
me
by
the
flap
of
my
ear
and
lead
me
gently
home
i
promise
i
said
and
burton
left
the
recovery
of
the
bag
was
only
one
of
the
many
astonishing
things
that
happened
that
day
and
the
following
night
hawes
who
knew
little
of
what
it
all
meant
and
disapproved
a
great
deal
ended
that
afternoon
by
locking
himself
blinking
furiously
in
his
private
office
to
hawes
any
practice
that
was
not
lucrative
was
bad
practice
about
four
when
i
had
shut
myself
away
from
the
crowd
in
the
outer
office
and
was
letting
miss
grant
take
their
depositions
as
to
when
and
where
they
had
seen
a
little
old
lady
probably
demented
wandering
around
the
streets
a
woman
came
who
refused
to
be
turned
away
young
woman
i
heard
her
say
speaking
to
miss
grant
he
may
have
important
business
but
i
guess
mine
just
a
little
more
so
i
interfered
then
and
let
her
come
in
she
was
a
woman
of
medium
height
quietly
dressed
and
fairly
handsome
my
first
impression
was
favorable
she
moved
with
a
certain
dignity
and
she
was
not
laced
crimped
or
made
up
i
am
more
sophisticated
now
the
lady
who
tells
me
things
says
that
the
respectable
women
nowadays
and
the
unrespectable
however
the
illusion
was
gone
the
moment
she
began
to
speak
her
voice
was
heavy
throaty
expressionless
she
threw
it
like
a
weapon
i
am
perfectly
honest
in
saying
that
for
a
moment
the
surprise
of
her
voice
outweighed
the
remarkable
thing
she
was
saying
i
am
allan
fleming
she
said
with
a
certain
husky
defiance
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
after
a
minute
you
mean
the
allan
fleming
who
has
just
died
she
nodded
i
could
see
she
was
unable
just
then
to
speak
she
had
nerved
herself
to
the
interview
but
it
was
evident
that
there
was
a
real
grief
she
fumbled
for
a
handkerchief
and
her
throat
worked
convulsively
i
saw
now
that
she
was
in
mourning
do
you
mean
i
asked
incredulously
that
fleming
married
a
second
time
he
married
me
three
years
ago
in
plattsburg
i
came
from
there
last
night
i
could
leave
before
does
miss
fleming
know
about
this
second
marriage
no
nobody
knew
about
it
i
have
had
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
knox
it
a
hard
thing
for
a
woman
to
know
that
people
are
talking
about
her
and
all
the
time
she
married
as
tight
as
ring
and
book
can
do
it
i
suppose
i
hazarded
if
that
is
the
case
you
have
come
about
the
estate
estate
her
tone
was
scornful
i
guess
i
take
what
coming
to
me
as
far
as
that
goes
and
it
wo
be
much
no
i
came
to
ask
what
they
mean
by
saying
allan
fleming
killed
himself
do
you
think
he
did
i
know
he
did
not
she
said
tensely
not
only
that
i
know
who
did
it
it
was
schwartz
henry
schwartz
schwartz
but
what
on
earth
you
do
know
schwartz
she
said
grimly
i
was
married
to
him
for
fifteen
years
i
took
him
when
he
had
a
saloon
in
the
fifth
ward
at
plattsburg
the
next
year
he
was
alderman
i
did
expect
in
those
days
to
see
him
riding
around
in
an
automobile
not
but
what
he
was
making
money
henry
schwartz
is
a
that
why
he
boss
of
the
state
now
and
you
divorced
him
he
was
a
brute
she
said
vindictively
he
wanted
me
to
go
back
to
him
and
i
told
him
i
would
rather
die
i
took
a
big
house
and
kept
bachelor
suites
for
gentlemen
fleming
lived
there
and
he
married
me
three
years
ago
he
and
schwartz
had
to
stand
together
but
they
hated
each
other
schwartz
i
meditated
do
you
happen
to
know
if
senator
schwartz
was
in
plattsburg
at
the
time
of
the
mur
of
fleming
death
he
was
here
in
manchester
he
had
threatened
fleming
life
he
had
already
tried
to
kill
him
the
day
we
were
married
he
stabbed
him
twice
but
not
deep
enough
i
looked
at
her
in
wonder
for
this
woman
not
extraordinarily
handsome
two
men
had
fought
and
one
had
died
according
to
her
story
i
can
prove
everything
i
say
she
went
on
rapidly
i
have
letters
from
fleming
telling
me
what
to
do
in
case
he
was
shot
down
i
have
papers
canceled
notes
that
would
put
schwartz
in
the
penitentiary
that
is
she
said
cunningly
i
did
have
them
fleming
took
them
away
are
you
afraid
for
yourself
i
asked
yes
i
afraid
afraid
he
get
me
back
yet
it
would
please
him
to
see
me
crawl
back
on
my
knees
but
he
can
not
force
you
to
go
back
to
him
yes
he
can
she
shivered
from
which
i
knew
she
had
told
me
only
a
part
of
her
story
after
all
she
had
nothing
more
to
tell
fleming
had
been
shot
schwartz
had
been
in
the
city
about
the
borough
bank
he
had
threatened
fleming
before
but
a
political
peace
had
been
patched
schwartz
knew
the
white
cat
that
was
all
before
she
left
she
told
me
something
i
had
not
known
i
know
a
lot
about
inside
politics
she
said
as
she
got
up
i
have
seen
the
state
divided
up
with
the
roast
at
my
table
and
served
around
with
the
dessert
and
i
can
tell
you
something
you
do
know
about
your
white
cat
a
back
staircase
leads
to
one
of
the
rooms
and
shuts
off
with
a
locked
door
it
opens
below
out
a
side
entrance
not
supposed
to
be
used
only
a
few
know
of
it
henry
butler
was
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
that
staircase
he
shot
himself
did
he
the
police
said
so
she
replied
with
her
grim
smile
there
is
such
a
thing
as
murdering
a
man
by
driving
him
to
suicide
she
wrote
an
address
on
a
card
and
gave
it
to
me
just
a
minute
i
said
as
she
was
about
to
go
have
you
ever
heard
fleming
speak
of
the
misses
maitland
they
were
his
first
wife
sisters
no
he
never
talked
of
them
but
i
believe
just
before
he
left
plattsburg
he
tried
to
borrow
some
money
from
them
and
failed
the
oldest
one
telegraphed
the
refusal
collect
she
said
smiling
faintly
there
is
something
else
i
said
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
number
eleven
no
or
why
yes
she
said
it
is
the
number
of
my
house
it
seemed
rather
ridiculous
when
she
had
gone
and
i
sat
down
to
think
it
over
it
was
anticlimax
to
say
the
least
if
the
mysterious
number
meant
only
the
address
of
this
very
ordinary
woman
then
it
was
probable
her
story
of
schwartz
was
true
enough
but
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
it
nor
could
i
imagine
schwartz
with
his
great
bulk
skulking
around
pinning
scraps
of
paper
to
pillows
it
would
have
been
more
like
the
fearlessness
and
passion
of
the
man
to
have
shot
fleming
down
in
the
state
house
corridor
or
on
the
street
and
to
have
trusted
to
his
influence
to
set
him
free
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
something
essentially
feminine
in
the
revenge
of
the
figures
that
had
haunted
the
dead
man
i
wondered
if
fleming
had
told
me
all
or
only
half
the
truth
that
night
at
the
most
peaceful
spot
i
had
ever
known
fred
home
occurred
another
inexplicable
affair
one
that
left
us
all
with
racked
nerves
and
listening
fearful
ears
chapter
xviii
edith
cousin
that
was
to
be
margery
last
evening
at
fred
edith
had
kept
her
as
long
as
she
could
but
the
girl
felt
that
her
place
was
with
miss
letitia
edith
was
desolate
i
do
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
without
you
she
said
that
night
when
we
were
all
together
in
the
library
with
a
wood
fire
for
light
and
coziness
more
than
heat
margery
was
sitting
before
the
fire
and
while
the
others
talked
she
sat
mostly
silent
looking
into
the
blaze
the
may
night
was
cold
and
rainy
and
fred
had
been
reading
us
a
poem
he
had
just
finished
receiving
with
indifference
my
comment
on
it
and
basking
in
edith
rapture
do
you
know
yourself
what
it
is
about
i
inquired
caustically
if
it
about
anything
it
is
poetry
he
replied
poetry
appeals
to
the
ear
it
is
primarily
sensuous
if
it
is
more
than
that
it
ceases
to
be
poetry
and
becomes
verse
edith
yawned
i
afraid
i
getting
old
she
said
i
getting
the
nap
habit
after
dinner
fred
run
up
will
you
and
see
if
katie
put
blankets
over
the
boys
fred
stuffed
his
poem
in
his
pocket
and
went
resignedly
edith
yawned
again
and
prepared
to
retire
to
the
den
for
forty
winks
if
ellen
decides
to
come
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
please
come
and
wake
me
she
said
she
felt
better
and
might
come
down
at
the
door
she
turned
behind
margery
back
and
made
me
a
sweeping
and
comprehensive
signal
she
finished
it
off
with
a
double
wink
edith
having
never
been
able
to
wink
one
eye
alone
and
crossing
the
hall
closed
the
door
of
the
den
with
an
obtrusive
bang
margery
and
i
were
alone
the
girl
looked
at
me
smiled
a
little
and
drew
a
long
breath
it
queer
about
edith
i
said
i
never
before
knew
her
to
get
drowsy
after
dinner
if
she
were
not
beyond
suspicion
i
would
think
it
a
scheme
and
she
and
fred
sitting
and
holding
hands
in
a
corner
somewhere
but
why
a
scheme
she
had
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
the
eternal
ring
sparkled
malignantly
they
might
think
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
i
suggested
to
me
to
you
the
fact
is
i
do
perhaps
i
was
morbid
about
the
ring
it
seemed
to
me
she
lifted
her
hand
and
looked
at
it
it
drafty
in
here
do
you
think
so
she
asked
suddenly
looking
back
of
her
probably
she
had
not
meant
it
but
i
got
up
and
closed
the
door
into
the
hall
when
i
came
back
i
took
the
chair
next
to
her
and
for
a
moment
we
said
nothing
the
log
threw
out
tiny
red
devil
sparks
and
the
clock
chimed
eight
very
slowly
harry
wardrop
was
here
last
night
i
said
poking
down
the
log
with
my
heel
here
yes
i
suppose
i
was
wrong
but
i
did
not
say
you
were
here
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
closely
out
of
the
most
beautiful
eyes
i
ever
saw
i
not
afraid
to
see
him
she
said
proudly
and
he
ought
not
to
be
afraid
to
see
me
i
want
to
tell
you
something
before
you
see
him
last
night
before
he
came
i
thought
that
well
that
at
least
he
knew
something
of
the
things
we
want
to
know
yes
in
justice
to
him
and
because
i
want
to
fight
fair
i
tell
you
that
i
do
believe
he
knows
anything
about
your
death
and
that
i
believe
he
was
robbed
that
night
at
bellwood
what
about
the
pearls
he
sold
at
plattsburg
she
asked
suddenly
i
think
when
the
proper
time
comes
he
will
tell
about
that
too
margery
i
did
not
notice
my
use
of
her
name
until
too
late
if
she
heard
she
failed
to
resent
it
after
all
if
you
love
him
hardly
anything
else
matters
does
it
how
do
we
know
but
that
he
was
in
trouble
and
that
aunt
jane
herself
gave
them
to
him
she
looked
at
me
with
a
little
perplexity
you
plead
his
cause
very
well
she
said
did
he
ask
you
to
speak
to
me
i
wo
run
a
race
with
a
man
who
is
lame
i
said
quietly
ethically
i
ought
to
go
away
and
leave
you
to
your
dreams
but
i
am
not
going
to
do
it
if
you
love
wardrop
as
a
woman
ought
to
love
the
man
she
marries
then
marry
him
and
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
if
you
do
no
let
me
finish
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
clear
him
if
i
can
to
bring
him
to
you
with
a
clear
slate
then
i
know
it
is
audacious
but
i
am
going
to
come
too
and
i
going
to
plead
for
myself
then
unless
you
send
me
away
she
sat
with
her
head
bent
her
color
coming
and
going
nervously
now
she
looked
up
at
me
with
what
was
the
ghost
of
a
smile
it
sounds
like
a
threat
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
you
i
wonder
if
you
always
get
what
you
want
then
of
course
fred
came
in
and
fell
over
a
hassock
looking
for
matches
edith
opened
the
door
of
the
den
and
called
him
to
her
irritably
but
fred
declined
to
leave
the
wood
fire
and
settled
down
in
his
easy
chair
after
a
while
edith
came
over
and
joined
us
but
she
snubbed
fred
the
entire
evening
to
his
bewilderment
and
when
conversation
lagged
during
the
evening
that
followed
i
tried
to
remember
what
i
had
said
and
knew
i
had
done
very
badly
only
one
thing
cheered
me
she
had
not
been
angry
and
she
had
understood
blessed
be
the
woman
that
understands
we
broke
up
for
the
night
about
eleven
butler
had
come
down
for
a
while
and
had
even
played
a
little
something
of
tschaikovsky
a
singing
plaintive
theme
that
brought
sadness
back
into
margery
face
and
made
me
think
for
no
reason
of
a
wet
country
road
and
a
plodding
peasant
fred
and
i
sat
in
the
library
for
a
while
after
the
rest
had
gone
and
i
told
him
a
little
of
what
i
had
learned
that
afternoon
a
second
wife
he
said
and
a
primitive
type
eh
well
did
she
shoot
him
or
did
schwartz
the
lady
or
the
democratic
tiger
the
tiger
i
said
firmly
the
lady
fred
with
equal
assurance
fred
closed
the
house
with
his
usual
care
it
required
the
combined
efforts
of
the
maids
followed
up
by
fred
to
lock
the
windows
it
being
his
confident
assertion
that
in
seven
years
of
keeping
house
he
had
never
failed
to
find
at
least
one
unlocked
window
on
that
night
i
remember
he
went
around
with
his
usual
scrupulous
care
then
we
went
up
to
bed
leaving
a
small
light
at
the
telephone
in
the
lower
hall
nothing
else
the
house
was
a
double
one
built
around
a
square
hall
below
which
served
the
purpose
of
a
general
from
the
front
door
a
short
narrow
hall
led
back
to
this
with
a
room
on
either
side
and
from
it
doors
led
into
the
rest
of
the
lower
floor
at
one
side
the
stairs
took
the
ascent
easily
with
two
stops
for
landings
and
the
bedrooms
opened
from
a
similar
slightly
smaller
square
hall
the
staircase
to
the
third
floor
went
up
from
somewhere
back
in
the
nursery
wing
my
bedroom
was
over
the
library
and
butler
and
margery
fleming
had
connecting
rooms
across
the
hall
fred
and
edith
slept
in
the
nursery
wing
so
they
would
be
near
the
children
in
the
square
upper
hall
there
was
a
big
reading
table
a
lamp
and
some
comfortable
chairs
here
when
they
were
alone
fred
read
aloud
the
evening
paper
or
his
latest
short
story
and
edith
sewing
basket
showed
how
she
put
in
what
women
miscall
their
leisure
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
at
once
naturally
the
rather
vital
step
i
had
taken
in
the
library
insisted
on
being
considered
and
almost
regretted
i
tried
reading
myself
to
sleep
and
when
that
failed
i
tried
the
soothing
combination
of
a
cigarette
and
a
book
that
worked
like
a
charm
the
last
thing
i
remember
is
of
holding
the
cigarette
in
a
death
grip
as
i
lay
with
my
pillows
propped
back
of
me
my
head
to
the
light
and
a
delightful
languor
creeping
over
me
i
was
wakened
by
the
pungent
acrid
smell
of
smoke
and
i
sat
up
and
blinked
my
eyes
open
the
side
of
the
bed
was
sending
up
a
steady
column
of
gray
smoke
and
there
was
a
smart
crackle
of
fire
under
me
somewhere
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
saw
the
trouble
instantly
my
cigarette
had
dropped
from
my
hand
still
lighted
and
as
is
the
way
with
cigarettes
determined
to
burn
to
the
end
in
so
doing
it
had
fired
my
bed
the
rug
under
the
bed
and
pretty
nearly
the
man
on
the
bed
it
took
some
sharp
work
to
get
it
all
out
without
rousing
the
house
then
i
stood
amid
the
wreckage
and
looked
ruefully
at
edith
pretty
room
i
could
see
mentally
the
spot
of
water
on
the
library
ceiling
the
next
morning
and
i
could
hear
fred
strictures
on
the
heedlessness
and
indifference
to
property
of
bachelors
in
general
and
me
in
particular
three
pitchers
of
water
on
the
bed
had
made
it
an
impossible
couch
i
put
on
a
and
with
a
blanket
over
my
arm
i
went
out
to
hunt
some
sort
of
place
to
sleep
i
decided
on
the
davenport
in
the
hall
just
outside
and
as
quietly
as
i
could
i
put
a
screen
around
it
and
settled
down
for
the
night
i
was
wakened
by
the
touch
of
a
hand
on
my
face
i
started
i
think
and
the
hand
was
jerked
away
i
am
not
sure
i
was
still
drowsy
i
lay
very
quiet
listening
for
footsteps
but
none
came
with
the
feeling
that
there
was
some
one
behind
the
screen
i
jumped
up
the
hall
was
dark
and
quiet
when
i
found
no
one
i
concluded
it
had
been
only
a
vivid
dream
and
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
davenport
and
yawned
i
heard
edith
moving
back
in
the
nursery
she
has
an
uncomfortable
habit
of
wandering
around
in
the
night
covering
the
children
closing
windows
and
sniffing
for
fire
i
was
afraid
some
of
the
smoke
from
my
conflagration
had
reached
her
suspicious
nose
but
she
did
not
come
into
the
front
hall
i
was
by
that
time
and
it
was
then
i
think
that
i
noticed
a
heavy
sweetish
odor
in
the
air
at
first
i
thought
one
of
the
children
might
be
ill
and
that
edith
was
dosing
him
with
one
of
the
choice
concoctions
that
she
kept
in
the
medicine
closet
when
she
closed
her
door
however
and
went
back
to
bed
i
knew
i
had
been
mistaken
the
sweetish
smell
was
almost
nauseating
for
some
reason
or
other
association
of
certain
odors
with
certain
events
i
found
myself
recalling
the
time
i
had
a
wisdom
tooth
taken
out
and
that
when
i
came
around
i
was
being
sat
on
by
the
dentist
and
his
assistant
and
the
latter
had
a
black
eye
then
suddenly
i
knew
the
sickly
odor
was
chloroform
i
had
the
light
on
in
a
moment
and
was
rapping
at
margery
door
it
was
locked
and
i
got
no
answer
a
pale
light
shone
over
the
transom
but
everything
was
ominously
quiet
beyond
the
door
i
went
to
butler
door
next
it
was
unlocked
and
partly
open
one
glance
at
the
empty
bed
and
the
confusion
of
the
place
and
i
rushed
without
ceremony
through
the
connecting
door
into
margery
room
the
atmosphere
was
reeking
with
chloroform
the
girl
was
in
bed
apparently
sleeping
quietly
one
arm
was
thrown
up
over
her
head
and
the
other
lay
relaxed
on
the
white
cover
a
folded
towel
had
been
laid
across
her
face
and
when
i
jerked
it
away
i
saw
she
was
breathing
very
slowly
stertorously
with
her
eyes
partly
open
and
fixed
i
threw
up
all
the
windows
before
i
roused
the
family
and
as
soon
as
edith
was
in
the
room
i
telephoned
for
the
doctor
i
hardly
remember
what
i
did
until
he
came
i
know
we
tried
to
rouse
margery
and
failed
and
i
know
that
fred
went
and
said
the
silver
was
intact
and
the
back
kitchen
door
open
and
then
the
doctor
came
and
i
was
put
out
in
the
hall
and
for
an
eternity
i
walked
up
and
down
eight
steps
one
way
eight
steps
back
unable
to
think
unable
even
to
hope
not
until
the
doctor
came
out
to
me
and
said
she
was
better
and
would
i
call
a
maid
to
make
some
strong
black
coffee
did
i
come
out
of
my
stupor
the
chance
of
doing
something
anything
made
me
determine
to
make
the
coffee
myself
they
still
speak
of
that
coffee
at
fred
it
was
edith
who
brought
butler
to
my
mind
fred
had
maintained
that
she
had
fled
before
the
intruders
and
was
probably
in
some
closet
or
corner
of
the
upper
floor
i
am
afraid
our
solicitude
was
long
in
coming
it
was
almost
an
hour
before
we
organized
a
searching
party
to
look
for
her
fred
went
and
i
took
the
lower
floor
it
was
i
who
found
her
after
all
lying
full
length
on
the
grass
in
the
little
square
yard
back
of
the
house
she
was
in
a
dead
faint
and
she
was
a
much
more
difficult
patient
than
margery
we
could
get
no
story
from
either
of
them
that
night
the
two
rooms
had
been
ransacked
but
apparently
nothing
had
been
stolen
fred
vowed
he
had
locked
and
bolted
the
kitchen
door
and
that
it
had
been
opened
from
within
it
was
a
strange
experience
that
night
intrusion
into
the
house
without
robbery
as
a
motive
if
margery
knew
or
suspected
the
reason
for
the
outrage
she
refused
to
say
as
for
butler
to
mention
the
occurrence
put
her
into
hysteria
it
was
fred
who
put
forth
the
most
startling
theory
of
the
lot
by
george
he
said
the
next
morning
when
we
had
failed
to
find
tracks
in
the
yard
and
edith
had
reported
every
silver
spoon
in
its
place
by
george
it
would
surprise
me
if
the
lady
in
the
grave
clothes
did
it
herself
there
is
anything
a
hysterical
woman
wo
do
to
rouse
your
interest
in
her
if
it
begins
to
flag
how
did
any
one
get
in
through
that
kitchen
door
when
it
was
locked
inside
and
bolted
i
tell
you
she
opened
it
herself
i
did
not
like
to
force
margery
confidence
but
i
believed
that
the
outrage
was
directly
for
the
purpose
of
searching
her
room
perhaps
for
papers
that
had
been
her
father
butler
came
around
enough
by
morning
to
tell
a
story
in
which
she
claimed
that
two
men
had
come
in
from
a
veranda
roof
and
tried
to
chloroform
her
that
she
had
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
had
taken
the
first
opportunity
while
they
were
in
the
other
room
to
run
and
into
the
yard
edith
thought
it
likely
enough
being
a
credulous
person
as
it
turned
out
edith
intuition
was
more
reliable
than
my
skepticism
or
fred
chapter
xix
back
to
bellwood
the
inability
of
margery
fleming
to
tell
who
had
chloroformed
her
and
butler
white
face
and
brooding
eyes
made
a
very
respectable
mystery
out
of
the
affair
only
fred
edith
and
i
came
down
to
breakfast
that
morning
fred
expression
was
half
amused
half
puzzled
edith
fluttered
uneasily
over
the
coffee
machine
her
cheeks
as
red
as
the
bow
of
ribbon
at
her
throat
i
was
preoccupied
and
like
fred
i
propped
the
morning
paper
in
front
of
me
and
proceeded
to
think
in
its
shelter
did
you
find
anything
fred
edith
asked
fred
did
not
reply
so
she
repeated
the
question
with
some
emphasis
eh
what
fred
inquired
peering
around
the
corner
of
the
paper
did
you
find
any
clue
yes
dear
that
is
no
nothing
to
amount
to
anything
upon
my
soul
jack
if
i
wrote
the
editorials
of
this
paper
i
something
he
subsided
into
inarticulate
growls
behind
the
paper
and
everything
was
quiet
then
i
heard
a
sniffle
distinctly
i
looked
up
edith
was
crying
pouring
cream
into
a
coffee
cup
and
feeling
blindly
for
the
sugar
with
her
pretty
face
twisted
and
her
pretty
eyes
obscured
in
a
second
i
was
up
had
crumpled
the
newspapers
including
fred
into
a
ball
and
had
lifted
him
bodily
out
of
his
chair
when
i
am
married
i
said
fiercely
jerking
him
around
to
edith
and
pushing
him
into
a
chair
beside
her
if
i
ever
read
the
paper
at
breakfast
when
my
wife
is
bursting
for
conversation
may
i
have
some
good
and
faithful
friend
who
will
bring
me
back
to
a
sense
of
my
duty
i
drew
a
chair
to
edith
other
side
now
let
talk
i
said
she
wiped
her
eyes
shamelessly
with
her
table
napkin
there
is
a
soul
in
this
house
i
can
talk
to
she
wailed
all
kinds
of
awful
things
happening
and
we
had
to
send
for
coffee
this
morning
jack
you
must
have
used
four
pounds
last
night
and
nobody
will
tell
me
a
thing
there
no
use
asking
margery
she
sick
at
her
stomach
from
the
chloroform
and
ellen
never
talks
except
about
herself
and
horribly
uninteresting
and
fred
and
you
make
a
ba
barricade
out
of
newspapers
and
fire
at
me
when
you
mean
i
put
the
coffee
back
where
i
got
it
edith
i
protested
stoutly
i
know
we
barbarians
but
i
swear
to
that
and
then
i
stopped
for
i
had
a
sudden
recollection
of
going
with
something
fat
and
tinny
in
my
arms
of
finding
it
in
my
way
and
of
hastily
thrusting
it
into
the
boys
boot
closet
under
the
nursery
stair
fred
had
said
nothing
he
had
taken
her
hand
and
was
patting
it
gently
the
while
his
eye
sought
the
on
the
wad
of
morning
paper
you
burned
that
blue
rug
she
said
to
me
disconsolately
with
a
threat
of
fresh
tears
it
took
me
ages
to
find
the
right
shade
of
blue
i
will
buy
you
that
shirvan
you
wanted
i
hastened
to
assure
her
yes
to
take
away
when
you
get
married
there
is
a
hint
of
the
shrew
in
all
good
women
i
will
buy
the
shirvan
and
get
married
here
i
regret
to
say
edith
suddenly
laughed
she
threw
her
head
back
and
jeered
at
me
you
she
chortled
and
pointed
one
slim
finger
at
me
mockingly
you
who
are
so
mad
about
one
girl
that
you
love
all
women
for
her
sake
you
who
go
white
instead
of
red
when
she
comes
into
the
room
you
who
have
let
your
practice
go
to
the
dogs
to
be
near
her
and
then
never
speak
to
her
when
she
around
but
sit
with
your
mouth
open
like
a
puppy
begging
for
candy
ready
to
snap
up
every
word
she
throws
you
and
wiggle
with
joy
i
was
terrified
honestly
edith
do
i
do
that
i
gasped
but
she
did
not
answer
she
only
leaned
over
and
kissed
fred
women
like
men
to
be
awful
fools
about
them
she
said
that
why
so
crazy
about
freddie
he
writhed
if
i
tell
you
something
nice
jack
will
you
make
it
a
rug
room
size
it
is
then
margery
engagement
ring
was
stolen
last
night
and
when
i
commiserated
her
she
said
dear
me
the
lamp
out
and
the
coffee
is
cold
remarkable
speech
under
the
circumstances
said
fred
edith
rang
the
bell
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
perhaps
we
better
make
it
four
small
rugs
instead
of
one
large
one
she
said
not
a
rug
until
you
have
told
me
what
margery
said
firmly
oh
that
why
she
said
it
really
did
matter
about
the
ring
she
had
never
cared
much
about
it
anyway
but
that
only
a
matter
of
taste
i
protested
somewhat
disappointed
but
edith
got
up
and
patted
me
on
the
top
of
my
head
silly
she
said
if
the
right
man
came
along
and
gave
her
a
rubber
teething
ring
she
be
crazy
about
it
for
his
sake
edith
fred
said
shocked
but
edith
had
gone
she
took
me
before
i
left
for
the
office
to
measure
for
the
shirvan
edith
being
a
person
who
believes
in
obtaining
a
thing
while
the
desire
for
it
is
in
its
first
bloom
across
the
hall
fred
was
talking
to
margery
through
the
transom
mustard
leaves
are
mighty
helpful
he
was
saying
i
always
take
on
shipboard
and
cheer
up
land
in
sight
i
would
have
given
much
for
fred
ease
of
manner
when
a
few
minutes
later
edith
having
decided
on
four
shirvans
and
a
hall
runner
she
took
me
to
the
door
of
margery
room
she
was
lying
very
still
and
pale
in
the
center
of
the
white
bed
and
she
tried
bravely
to
smile
at
us
i
hope
you
are
better
i
said
do
let
edith
convince
you
that
my
coffee
has
poisoned
you
she
said
she
was
a
little
better
and
that
she
did
know
she
had
had
any
coffee
that
was
the
extent
of
the
conversation
i
who
have
a
local
reputation
of
a
sort
before
a
jury
i
could
not
think
of
another
word
to
say
i
stood
there
for
a
minute
uneasily
with
edith
poking
me
with
her
finger
to
go
inside
the
door
and
speak
and
act
like
an
intelligent
human
being
but
i
only
muttered
something
about
a
busy
day
before
me
and
fled
it
was
a
singular
thing
but
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
i
had
a
vivid
mental
picture
of
edith
description
of
me
sitting
up
to
beg
for
a
kind
word
and
wiggling
with
delight
when
i
got
it
if
i
slunk
into
my
office
that
morning
like
a
dog
scourged
to
his
kennel
edith
was
responsible
at
the
office
i
found
a
note
from
miss
letitia
and
after
a
glance
at
it
i
looked
for
the
first
train
in
my
railroad
schedule
the
note
was
brief
unlike
the
similar
epistle
i
had
received
from
miss
jane
the
day
she
disappeared
this
one
was
very
formal
john
knox
dear
sir
kindly
oblige
me
by
coming
to
see
me
as
soon
as
you
get
this
some
things
have
happened
not
that
i
think
they
are
worth
a
row
of
pins
but
hepsibah
is
an
old
fool
and
she
says
she
did
not
put
the
note
in
the
milk
bottle
yours
very
respectfully
letitia
ann
maitland
i
had
an
appointment
with
burton
for
the
afternoon
to
take
wardrop
if
we
could
get
him
on
some
pretext
to
doctor
anderson
that
day
also
i
had
two
cases
on
the
trial
list
i
got
humphreys
across
the
hall
to
take
them
over
and
evading
hawes
resentful
blink
i
went
on
my
way
to
bellwood
it
was
nine
days
since
miss
jane
had
disappeared
on
my
way
out
in
the
train
i
jotted
down
the
things
that
had
happened
in
that
time
allan
fleming
had
died
and
been
buried
the
borough
bank
had
failed
some
one
had
got
into
the
fleming
house
and
gone
through
the
papers
there
clarkson
had
killed
himself
we
had
found
that
wardrop
had
sold
the
pearls
the
leather
bag
had
been
returned
fleming
second
wife
had
appeared
and
some
one
had
broken
into
my
own
house
and
intentionally
or
not
had
almost
sent
margery
fleming
over
the
borderland
it
seemed
to
me
everything
pointed
in
one
direction
to
a
malignity
against
fleming
that
extended
itself
to
the
daughter
i
thought
of
what
the
woman
who
claimed
to
be
the
dead
man
second
wife
had
said
the
day
before
if
the
staircase
she
had
spoken
of
opened
into
the
room
where
fleming
was
shot
and
if
schwartz
was
in
town
at
the
time
then
in
view
of
her
story
that
he
had
already
tried
once
to
kill
him
the
likelihood
was
that
schwartz
was
at
least
implicated
if
wardrop
knew
that
why
had
he
not
denounced
him
was
i
to
believe
that
after
all
the
mystery
the
number
eleven
was
to
resolve
itself
into
the
number
of
a
house
would
it
be
typical
of
the
schwartz
i
knew
to
pin
bits
of
paper
to
a
man
pillow
on
the
other
hand
if
he
had
reason
to
think
that
fleming
had
papers
that
would
incriminate
him
it
would
be
like
schwartz
to
hire
some
one
to
search
for
them
and
he
would
be
equal
to
having
wardrop
robbed
of
the
money
he
was
taking
to
fleming
granting
that
schwartz
had
killed
fleming
then
who
was
the
woman
with
wardrop
the
night
he
was
robbed
why
did
he
take
the
pearls
and
sell
them
how
did
the
number
eleven
come
into
aunt
possession
how
did
the
leather
bag
get
to
boston
who
had
chloroformed
margery
who
had
been
using
the
fleming
house
while
it
was
closed
most
important
of
all
now
where
was
aunt
jane
the
house
at
bellwood
looked
almost
cheerful
in
the
may
sunshine
as
i
went
up
the
walk
nothing
ever
changed
the
straight
folds
of
the
lace
curtains
no
dog
ever
tracked
the
porch
or
buried
sacrilegious
and
odorous
bones
on
the
level
lawn
the
birds
were
nesting
in
the
trees
well
above
the
reach
of
robert
ladder
but
they
were
decorous
birds
whose
prim
courting
never
partook
of
the
exuberance
of
their
neighbors
bursting
their
little
throats
in
an
elm
above
the
baby
perambulator
in
the
next
yard
when
bella
had
let
me
in
and
i
stood
once
more
in
the
straight
hall
with
the
green
rep
chairs
and
the
japanese
umbrella
stand
involuntarily
i
listened
for
the
tap
of
miss
jane
small
feet
on
the
stairs
instead
came
bella
heavy
tread
and
a
request
from
miss
letitia
that
i
go
the
old
lady
was
sitting
by
a
window
of
her
bedroom
in
a
chintz
upholstered
chair
she
did
not
appear
to
be
feeble
the
only
change
i
noticed
was
a
relaxation
in
the
severe
tidiness
of
her
dress
i
guessed
that
miss
jane
exquisite
neatness
had
been
responsible
for
the
white
ruchings
the
soft
caps
and
the
spotless
shoulder
shawls
which
had
made
lovely
their
latter
years
you
taken
your
own
time
about
coming
have
you
miss
letitia
asked
sourly
if
it
had
been
for
that
cousin
of
yours
you
sent
here
burton
i
have
been
driven
to
sending
for
amelia
miles
and
when
i
send
for
amelia
miles
for
company
i
in
a
bad
way
i
have
had
a
great
deal
to
attend
to
i
said
as
loud
as
i
could
i
came
some
days
ago
to
tell
you
fleming
was
dead
after
that
we
had
to
bury
him
and
close
the
house
it
been
a
very
sad
did
he
leave
anything
she
interrupted
it
is
sad
at
all
unless
he
did
leave
anything
he
left
very
little
the
house
perhaps
and
i
regret
to
have
to
tell
you
that
a
woman
came
to
me
yesterday
who
claims
to
be
a
second
wife
she
took
off
her
glasses
wiped
them
and
put
them
on
again
then
she
said
with
a
snap
there
one
other
woman
in
the
world
as
big
a
fool
as
my
sister
martha
was
i
did
know
there
were
two
of
what
do
you
hear
about
jane
the
last
time
i
was
here
i
shouted
you
thought
she
was
dead
have
you
changed
your
mind
the
last
time
you
were
here
she
said
with
dignity
i
thought
a
good
many
things
that
were
wrong
i
thought
i
had
lost
some
of
the
pearls
but
i
had
what
i
exclaimed
incredulously
she
put
her
hands
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
leaning
forward
shot
the
words
at
me
viciously
i
said
i
had
lost
some
of
the
pearls
well
i
have
she
did
expect
me
to
believe
her
any
more
than
she
believed
it
herself
but
why
on
earth
she
had
changed
her
attitude
about
the
pearls
was
beyond
me
i
merely
nodded
comprehensively
very
well
i
said
i
glad
to
know
it
was
a
mistake
now
the
next
thing
is
to
find
miss
jane
we
have
found
her
she
said
tartly
that
what
i
sent
for
you
about
found
her
this
time
i
did
get
out
of
my
chair
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
miss
letitia
why
we
been
scouring
the
country
for
her
she
opened
a
religious
monthly
on
the
table
beside
her
and
took
out
a
folded
paper
i
had
to
control
my
impatience
while
she
changed
her
glasses
and
read
it
slowly
heppie
found
it
on
the
back
porch
under
a
milk
bottle
she
prefaced
then
she
read
it
to
me
i
do
not
remember
the
wording
and
miss
letitia
refused
both
then
and
later
to
let
it
out
of
her
hands
as
a
result
unlike
the
other
manuscripts
in
the
case
i
have
not
even
a
copy
the
substance
shorn
of
its
bad
spelling
and
grammar
was
this
the
writer
knew
where
miss
jane
was
the
inference
being
that
he
was
responsible
she
was
well
and
happy
but
she
had
happened
to
read
a
newspaper
with
an
account
of
her
disappearance
and
it
had
worried
her
the
payment
of
the
small
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
would
send
her
back
as
well
as
the
day
she
left
the
amount
left
in
a
tin
can
on
the
base
of
the
maitland
shaft
in
the
cemetery
would
bring
the
missing
lady
back
within
hours
on
the
contrary
if
the
recipient
of
the
letter
notified
the
police
it
would
go
hard
with
miss
jane
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
asked
looking
at
me
over
her
glasses
if
she
was
fool
enough
to
be
carried
away
by
a
man
that
spells
cemetery
with
one
m
she
deserves
what
she
got
and
i
wo
pay
five
thousand
anyhow
it
entirely
too
much
it
does
sound
quite
genuine
to
me
i
said
reading
it
over
i
should
certainly
not
leave
any
money
until
we
had
tried
to
find
who
left
this
i
not
so
sure
but
what
she
better
stay
a
while
anyhow
miss
letitia
pursued
now
that
we
know
she
living
i
ai
so
particular
when
she
gets
back
she
been
notionate
lately
anyhow
i
had
been
reading
the
note
again
there
one
thing
here
that
makes
me
doubt
the
whole
story
i
said
what
this
about
her
reading
the
papers
i
thought
her
reading
glasses
were
found
in
the
library
miss
letitia
snatched
the
paper
from
me
and
read
it
again
reading
the
paper
she
sniffed
you
got
more
sense
than
i
been
giving
you
credit
for
knox
her
glasses
are
here
this
minute
without
them
she
ca
see
to
scratch
her
nose
it
was
a
disappointment
to
me
although
the
explanation
was
simple
enough
it
was
surprising
that
we
had
not
had
more
attempts
to
play
on
our
fears
but
the
really
important
thing
bearing
on
miss
departure
was
when
heppie
came
into
the
room
with
her
apron
turned
up
like
a
pocket
and
her
dust
cap
pushed
down
over
her
eyes
like
the
slouch
hat
of
a
bowery
tough
when
she
got
to
the
middle
of
the
room
she
stopped
and
abruptly
dropped
the
corners
of
her
apron
there
rolled
out
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
things
a
white
muslin
garment
which
proved
to
be
a
nightgown
with
long
sleeves
and
high
collar
a
hair
curlers
i
knew
those
edith
had
been
seen
in
midnight
emergencies
with
her
hair
twisted
around
just
such
instruments
of
torture
a
shoe
buttoner
a
railroad
map
and
one
new
and
unworn
black
kid
glove
miss
letitia
changed
her
glasses
deliberately
and
took
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
things
on
the
floor
where
did
you
get
she
said
fixing
heppie
with
an
awful
eye
i
found
stuffed
under
the
blankets
in
the
chest
of
drawers
in
the
attic
heppie
shouted
at
her
if
we
washed
blankets
last
week
as
i
wanted
to
shut
up
miss
letitia
said
shortly
and
heppie
thin
lips
closed
with
a
snap
now
then
knox
what
do
you
make
of
that
if
that
the
nightgown
she
was
wearing
the
night
she
disappeared
i
think
it
shows
one
thing
very
clearly
miss
maitland
she
was
not
abducted
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
she
was
about
none
of
her
clothes
was
missing
and
that
threw
us
off
the
track
but
look
at
this
new
glove
she
may
have
had
new
things
to
put
on
and
left
the
old
the
map
well
she
was
going
somewhere
with
a
definite
purpose
when
we
find
out
what
took
her
away
we
will
find
her
humph
she
did
go
unexpectedly
that
is
she
was
prepared
for
whatever
it
was
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
the
old
lady
burst
out
she
did
have
a
secret
she
was
the
kind
that
could
keep
a
secret
she
responsible
i
tell
you
she
was
extravagant
look
at
that
glove
and
she
had
three
pairs
half
worn
in
her
bureau
miss
maitland
i
asked
suddenly
did
you
ever
hear
of
eleven
eleven
what
just
the
number
eleven
i
repeated
does
it
mean
anything
to
you
has
it
any
significance
i
should
say
it
has
she
retorted
in
the
last
ten
years
the
colored
orphans
home
has
cared
for
fed
clothed
and
pampered
exactly
eleven
hundred
and
colored
children
of
every
condition
of
shape
and
misshape
brains
and
no
brains
it
has
no
other
connection
eleven
twice
eleven
is
if
that
any
help
no
i
ca
think
of
anything
i
loaned
allan
fleming
a
thousand
dollars
once
i
guess
my
mind
was
failing
it
would
be
about
eleven
by
this
time
neither
of
which
explanations
sufficed
for
the
little
scrap
found
in
miss
jane
room
what
connection
if
any
had
it
with
her
flight
where
was
she
now
what
was
eleven
and
why
did
miss
letitia
deny
that
she
had
lost
the
pearls
when
i
already
knew
that
nine
of
the
ten
had
been
sold
who
had
bought
them
and
approximately
how
much
he
had
paid
chapter
xx
association
of
ideas
i
ate
a
light
lunch
at
bellwood
alone
with
bella
to
look
after
me
in
the
she
was
very
solicitous
and
when
she
had
brought
my
tea
i
thought
she
wanted
to
say
something
she
stood
awkwardly
near
the
door
and
watched
me
you
need
wait
bella
i
said
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
is
miss
fleming
well
she
was
not
very
well
this
morning
but
i
do
think
it
is
serious
bella
i
replied
she
turned
to
go
but
i
fancied
she
hesitated
oh
bella
i
called
as
she
was
going
out
i
want
to
ask
you
something
the
night
at
the
fleming
home
when
you
and
i
watched
the
house
did
you
hear
some
person
running
along
the
hall
outside
your
door
about
two
i
think
she
looked
at
me
stolidly
no
sir
i
slept
all
night
that
strange
and
you
did
hear
me
when
i
fell
down
the
shaft
holy
saints
she
ejaculated
was
where
you
fell
she
stopped
herself
abruptly
you
heard
that
i
asked
gently
and
yet
you
slept
all
night
bella
there
a
hitch
somewhere
you
did
sleep
that
night
at
all
you
told
miss
fleming
i
had
been
up
all
night
how
did
you
know
that
if
i
know
that
you
could
possibly
get
around
as
fast
as
the
person
in
the
house
that
night
i
would
say
you
had
been
in
fleming
desk
looking
for
let
us
say
postage
stamps
may
i
have
another
cup
of
coffee
she
turned
a
sickly
yellow
white
and
gathered
up
my
cup
and
saucer
with
trembling
hands
when
the
coffee
finally
came
back
it
was
brought
grumblingly
by
old
heppie
she
says
she
turned
her
ankle
she
sniffed
turned
it
on
a
lathe
like
a
table
leg
i
should
say
from
the
shape
of
it
before
i
left
the
i
put
another
line
in
my
what
does
bella
know
i
got
back
to
the
city
somewhat
late
for
my
appointment
with
burton
i
found
wardrop
waiting
for
me
at
the
office
and
if
i
had
been
astonished
at
the
change
in
him
two
nights
before
i
was
shocked
now
he
seemed
to
have
shrunk
in
his
clothes
his
eyeballs
were
bloodshot
from
drinking
and
his
fair
hair
had
dropped
neglected
over
his
forehead
he
was
sitting
in
his
familiar
attitude
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
on
his
palms
he
looked
at
me
with
dull
eyes
when
i
went
in
i
did
not
see
burton
at
first
he
was
sitting
on
my
desk
holding
a
flat
can
in
his
hand
and
digging
out
with
a
wooden
toothpick
one
sardine
after
another
and
bolting
them
whole
your
good
health
he
said
poising
one
in
the
air
where
it
threatened
oily
tears
over
the
carpet
as
an
and
give
me
the
festive
sardine
how
lovely
it
would
be
if
we
could
eat
without
smelling
do
you
do
anything
but
eat
wardrop
asked
without
enthusiasm
burton
eyed
him
reproachfully
is
that
what
i
get
for
doing
without
lunch
in
order
to
prove
to
you
that
you
are
not
crazy
he
appealed
to
me
he
says
he
crazy
lost
his
think
works
now
i
ask
you
knox
when
i
go
to
the
trouble
to
find
out
for
him
that
he
got
as
many
convolutions
as
anybody
and
that
they
only
got
a
little
convolved
is
it
fair
i
ask
you
for
him
to
reproach
me
about
my
food
i
did
know
you
knew
each
other
i
put
in
while
burton
took
another
sardine
he
says
we
do
wardrop
said
wearily
says
he
used
to
knock
me
around
at
college
burton
winked
at
me
solemnly
he
does
remember
me
but
he
will
he
said
it
his
nerves
that
are
gone
and
we
have
him
restrung
with
new
wires
like
an
old
piano
in
a
week
wardrop
had
that
suspicion
of
all
men
but
i
think
he
grasped
at
me
as
a
dependability
he
wants
me
to
go
to
a
doctor
he
said
i
not
sick
it
only
he
was
trying
to
light
a
cigarette
but
the
match
dropped
from
his
shaking
fingers
better
see
one
wardrop
i
urged
and
i
felt
mean
enough
about
doing
it
you
need
something
to
brace
you
up
burton
gave
him
a
very
small
drink
for
he
could
scarcely
stand
and
we
went
down
in
the
elevator
my
contempt
for
the
victim
between
us
was
as
great
as
my
contempt
for
myself
that
wardrop
was
in
a
bad
position
there
could
be
no
doubt
there
might
be
more
men
than
fleming
who
had
known
about
the
money
in
the
leather
bag
and
who
thought
he
had
taken
it
and
probably
killed
fleming
to
hide
the
theft
it
seemed
incredible
that
an
innocent
man
would
collapse
as
he
had
done
and
yet
at
this
minute
i
can
name
a
dozen
men
who
under
the
club
of
public
disapproval
have
fallen
into
paresis
insanity
and
the
grave
we
are
all
indifferent
to
our
until
they
are
against
us
burton
knew
the
specialist
very
well
in
fact
there
seemed
to
be
few
people
he
did
not
know
and
considering
the
way
he
had
got
hold
of
miss
letitia
and
wardrop
it
was
not
surprising
he
had
evidently
arranged
with
the
doctor
for
the
was
empty
and
we
were
after
hours
the
doctor
was
a
large
man
his
size
emphasized
by
the
clothes
he
wore
very
light
in
color
and
unprofessional
in
cut
he
was
inclined
to
be
bald
and
with
shrewd
light
blue
eyes
behind
his
glasses
not
particularly
impressive
except
as
to
size
on
first
acquaintance
a
good
fellow
with
a
brisk
voice
and
an
amazingly
light
tread
he
began
by
sending
wardrop
into
a
sort
of
examining
room
in
the
rear
of
the
suite
somewhere
to
take
off
his
coat
and
collar
when
he
had
gone
the
doctor
looked
at
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
think
i
got
it
all
from
burton
he
said
of
course
knox
this
is
a
little
out
of
my
line
a
nerve
specialist
has
as
much
business
with
psychotherapy
as
a
piano
tuner
has
with
musical
technique
but
the
idea
is
munsterburg
and
i
had
some
good
results
i
give
him
a
short
physical
examination
and
when
i
ring
the
bell
one
of
you
may
come
in
are
you
a
newspaper
man
mr
knox
an
attorney
i
said
briefly
press
man
lawyer
or
doctor
burton
broke
in
we
all
fatten
on
the
other
fellow
troubles
do
we
we
do
fatten
very
much
i
corrected
we
live
the
doctor
blinked
behind
his
glasses
i
never
saw
a
lawyer
yet
who
would
admit
he
was
making
money
he
said
look
at
the
way
a
doctor
grinds
for
a
pittance
he
just
as
capable
as
the
lawyer
he
works
a
damn
sight
harder
and
he
makes
a
tenth
the
income
a
man
will
pay
his
lawyer
ten
thousand
dollars
for
keeping
him
out
of
jail
for
six
months
and
he
kick
like
a
steer
if
his
doctor
charges
him
a
hundred
to
keep
him
out
of
hell
for
life
which
of
you
will
come
in
i
afraid
two
would
distract
him
i
guess
it
is
knox
burton
conceded
but
i
get
it
later
doctor
you
promised
the
physical
examination
was
very
brief
when
i
was
called
in
wardrop
was
standing
at
the
window
looking
down
into
the
street
below
and
the
doctor
was
writing
at
his
desk
behind
wardrop
back
he
gave
me
the
slip
he
had
written
test
is
for
association
of
ideas
watch
length
of
time
between
word
i
give
and
his
reply
i
often
get
hold
of
facts
forgotten
by
the
patient
a
wait
before
the
answering
word
is
given
shows
an
attempt
at
concealment
now
wardrop
he
said
will
you
sit
here
please
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
for
wardrop
and
another
just
across
for
himself
i
sat
back
and
to
one
side
of
the
patient
where
i
could
see
wardrop
haggard
profile
and
every
movement
of
the
specialist
on
the
table
was
an
electric
instrument
like
a
small
clock
and
the
doctor
first
action
was
to
attach
to
it
two
wires
with
small
black
rubber
mouthpieces
now
wardrop
he
said
we
will
go
on
with
the
test
your
other
condition
is
fair
as
i
told
you
i
think
you
can
dismiss
the
idea
of
insanity
without
a
second
thought
but
there
is
something
more
than
brain
and
body
to
be
considered
in
other
words
you
have
been
through
a
storm
and
some
of
your
nervous
wires
are
down
put
the
mouthpiece
between
your
lips
please
you
see
i
do
the
same
with
mine
and
when
i
give
you
a
word
speak
as
quickly
as
possible
the
association
it
brings
to
your
mind
for
instance
i
say
your
first
association
might
be
almost
anything
associated
with
the
word
as
quickly
as
possible
please
the
first
few
words
went
simply
enough
wardrop
replies
came
almost
instantly
to
light
he
replied
lamp
touch
brought
the
response
hand
eat
brought
burton
and
both
the
doctor
and
i
smiled
wardrop
was
intensely
serious
then
taxicab
said
the
doctor
and
after
an
almost
imperceptible
pause
road
came
the
association
all
at
once
i
began
to
see
the
possibilities
desk
pen
pipe
smoke
head
after
a
perceptible
pause
the
answer
came
uncertainly
hair
but
the
association
of
ideas
would
not
be
denied
for
in
answer
to
the
next
word
which
was
ice
he
gave
blood
evidently
following
up
the
previous
word
head
i
found
myself
gripping
the
arms
of
my
chair
the
dial
on
the
instrument
was
measuring
the
interval
i
could
see
that
now
the
doctor
took
a
record
of
every
word
and
its
response
wardrop
eyes
were
shifting
nervously
hot
cold
white
black
whisky
glass
all
in
less
than

he
brought
out
the
word
train
after
an
evident
struggle
but
in
answer
to
the
next
word
lost
instead
of
the
obvious
found
he
said
woman
he
had
not
had
sufficient
mental
agility
to
get
away
from
the
association
with
bag
the
woman
belonged
there
murder
brought
dead
but
shot
following
immediately
after
brought
staircase
i
think
wardrop
was
on
his
guard
by
that
time
but
the
conscious
effort
to
hide
truths
that
might
be
damaging
made
the
intervals
longer
from
that
time
on
already
i
felt
sure
that
allan
fleming
widow
had
been
right
he
had
been
shot
from
the
locked
back
staircase
but
by
whom
blow
brought
chair
gone
bag
came
like
a
flash
in
quick
succession
without
pause
came
the
words
bank
note
door
bolt
money
letters
without
any
apparent
connection
wardrop
was
going
to
the
bad
when
to
the
next
word
staircase
again
he
said
scar
his
demoralization
was
almost
complete
as
for
me
the
scene
in
wardrop
mind
was
already
in
mine
schwartz
with
the
scar
across
his
ugly
forehead
and
the
bolted
door
to
the
staircase
open
on
again
with
the
test
flour
after
perhaps
two
seconds
from
the
preceding
shock
brought
bread
trees
leaves
night
dark
gate
he
stopped
here
so
long
i
thought
he
was
not
going
to
answer
at
all
presently
with
am
effort
he
said
wood
but
as
before
the
association
idea
came
out
in
the
next
word
for
electric
light
he
gave
letters
attic
brought
trunks
at
once
closet
after
perhaps
a
second
and
a
half
came
dust
showing
what
closet
was
in
his
mind
and
immediately
after
to
match
he
gave
pen
a
long
list
of
words
followed
which
told
nothing
to
my
mind
although
the
doctor
eyes
were
snapping
with
excitement
then
again
and
instead
of
his
previous
association
woman
this
time
he
gave
yellow
but
to
the
next
word
house
he
gave
guest
it
came
to
me
that
in
his
mental
processes
i
was
the
guest
the
substitute
bag
was
in
his
mind
as
being
in
my
possession
quick
as
a
flash
the
doctor
followed
up
guest
and
wardrop
fell
letters
he
said
to
a
great
many
words
as
i
said
before
i
could
attach
no
significance
here
and
there
i
got
a
ray
elderly
brought
black
warehouse
yard
for
no
apparent
reason
eleven
c
was
the
answer
given
without
a
hesitation
eleven
c
he
gave
no
evidence
of
having
noticed
any
peculiarity
in
what
he
said
i
doubt
if
he
realized
his
answer
to
me
he
gave
the
impression
of
repeating
something
he
had
apparently
forgotten
as
if
a
number
and
its
association
had
been
subconscious
and
brought
to
the
surface
by
the
psychologist
as
if
for
instance
some
one
prompted
a
b
and
the
corollary
c
came
without
summoning
the
psychologist
took
the
small
mouthpiece
from
his
lips
and
motioned
wardrop
to
do
the
same
the
test
was
over
i
do
call
that
bad
condition
wardrop
the
doctor
said
you
are
nervous
and
you
need
a
little
more
care
in
your
habits
you
want
to
exercise
regularly
and
you
will
have
to
cut
out
everything
in
the
way
of
stimulants
for
a
while
oh
yes
a
couple
of
drinks
a
day
at
first
then
one
a
day
and
then
none
and
you
are
to
stop
worrying
when
trouble
comes
round
and
stares
at
you
do
ask
it
in
to
have
a
drink
take
it
out
in
the
air
and
kill
it
oxygen
is
as
fatal
to
anxiety
as
it
is
to
tuberculosis
how
would
bellwood
do
i
asked
or
should
it
be
the
country
bellwood
of
course
the
doctor
responded
heartily
ten
miles
a
day
four
cigarettes
and
three
meals
which
is
more
than
you
have
been
taking
wardrop
by
two
i
put
him
on
the
train
for
bellwood
myself
and
late
that
afternoon
the
three
of
us
the
doctor
burton
and
myself
met
in
my
office
and
went
over
the
doctor
record
when
the
answer
comes
in
of
a
second
he
said
before
we
began
it
is
hardly
worth
comment
there
is
no
time
in
such
an
interval
for
any
mental
reservation
only
those
words
that
showed
noticeable
hesitation
need
be
considered
we
worked
until
almost
seven
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
doctor
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
thrust
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
i
got
the
story
from
burton
he
said
after
a
deep
breath
i
had
no
conclusion
formed
and
of
course
i
am
not
a
detective
things
looked
black
for
wardrop
in
view
of
the
money
lost
the
quarrel
with
fleming
that
morning
at
the
white
cat
and
the
circumstance
of
his
leaving
the
club
and
hunting
a
doctor
outside
instead
of
raising
the
alarm
still
no
two
men
ever
act
alike
in
an
emergency
psychology
is
as
exact
a
science
as
mathematics
it
gets
information
from
the
source
and
a
man
can
not
lie
in
of
a
second
you
noticed
brought
in
a
second
and
three
quarters
and
the
next
word
brought
the
that
he
had
held
back
before
that
does
show
anything
he
tried
to
avoid
what
was
horrible
to
him
but
i
gave
him
after
a
pause
he
responded
with
the
next
word
showed
what
was
in
his
mind
instead
of
he
said
now
then
i
believe
he
was
either
robbed
by
a
woman
or
he
thinks
he
was
after
all
we
can
only
get
what
he
believes
himself
letters
another
slip
staircase
where
are
the
stairs
at
the
white
cat
i
learned
yesterday
of
a
back
staircase
that
leads
into
one
of
the
upper
rooms
i
said
it
opens
on
a
side
entrance
and
is
used
in
emergency
the
doctor
smiled
confidently
we
look
there
for
our
criminal
he
said
nothing
hides
from
the
chronoscope
now
then
scar
is
that
significant
the
association
is
clear
a
scar
that
is
vivid
enough
disfiguring
enough
to
be
the
first
thing
that
enters
his
mind
schwartz
burton
said
with
awe
doctor
what
on
earth
does
c
mean
i
think
that
is
up
to
you
gentlemen
the
c
belongs
there
without
doubt
briefly
looking
over
these
slips
i
make
it
something
like
this
wardrop
thinks
a
woman
took
his
three
times
he
gave
the
word
in
response
to
and
did
he
have
a
guest
at
the
time
all
this
happened
at
bellwood
i
was
a
guest
in
the
house
at
the
time
did
you
offer
him
money
for
letters
no
did
he
give
you
any
letters
to
keep
for
him
he
gave
me
the
bag
that
was
substituted
for
his
locked
yes
by
jove
i
wonder
if
there
is
anything
in
it
i
have
reason
to
know
that
he
came
into
my
room
that
night
at
least
once
after
i
went
asleep
i
think
it
very
likely
he
said
dryly
one
thing
we
have
not
touched
on
and
i
believe
wardrop
knows
nothing
of
it
that
is
the
disappearance
of
the
old
lady
there
is
a
psychological
study
for
you
my
conclusion
well
i
should
say
that
wardrop
is
not
guilty
of
the
murder
he
knows
or
thinks
he
knows
who
is
he
has
a
theory
of
his
own
about
some
one
with
a
scar
it
may
be
only
a
theory
he
does
not
necessarily
know
but
he
hopes
he
is
in
a
state
of
abject
fear
also
he
is
hiding
something
concerning
letters
and
from
the
word
in
that
connection
i
believe
he
either
sold
or
bought
some
damaging
papers
he
is
not
a
criminal
but
he
is
what
is
almost
worse
the
doctor
rose
and
picked
up
his
hat
he
is
a
weakling
he
said
from
the
doorway
burton
looked
at
his
watch
by
george
he
said
and
i
had
nothing
since
lunch
but
a
box
of
sardines
i
off
to
chase
the
festive
mutton
chop
oh
by
the
way
knox
where
is
that
locked
bag
in
my
office
safe
i
drop
around
in
the
morning
and
assist
you
to
compound
a
felony
he
said
easily
but
as
it
happened
he
did
not
chapter
xxi
a
proscenium
box
i
was
very
late
for
dinner
fred
and
edith
were
getting
ready
for
a
concert
and
the
two
were
playing
pinochle
in
fred
den
neither
one
looked
much
the
worse
for
her
previous
night
experience
butler
was
always
pale
and
margery
had
been
so
since
her
death
the
game
was
over
when
i
went
into
the
den
as
usual
butler
left
the
room
almost
immediately
and
went
to
the
piano
across
the
hall
i
had
grown
to
accept
her
avoidance
of
me
without
question
fred
said
it
was
because
my
overwhelming
vitality
oppressed
her
personally
i
think
it
was
because
the
neurasthenic
type
of
woman
is
repulsive
to
me
no
doubt
butler
deserved
sympathy
but
her
open
demand
for
it
found
me
cold
and
unresponsive
i
told
margery
briefly
of
my
visit
to
bellwood
that
morning
she
was
as
puzzled
as
i
was
about
the
things
heppie
had
found
in
the
chest
she
was
relieved
too
i
am
just
as
sure
now
that
she
is
living
as
i
was
a
week
ago
that
she
was
dead
she
said
leaning
back
in
her
big
chair
but
what
terrible
thing
took
her
away
unless
unless
what
she
had
loaned
my
father
a
great
deal
of
money
margery
said
with
heightened
color
she
had
not
dared
to
tell
aunt
letitia
and
the
money
was
to
be
returned
before
she
found
it
out
then
things
went
wrong
with
the
borough
bank
and
the
money
did
not
come
back
if
you
know
aunt
jane
and
how
afraid
she
is
of
aunt
letitia
you
will
understand
how
terrible
it
was
for
her
i
have
wondered
if
she
would
go
to
plattsburg
and
try
to
find
father
there
the
man
is
working
on
that
theory
now
i
replied
margery
if
there
was
a
letter
added
to
eleven
would
you
know
what
it
meant
she
shook
her
head
in
the
negative
will
you
answer
two
more
questions
i
asked
yes
if
i
can
do
you
know
why
you
were
chloroformed
last
night
and
who
did
it
i
think
i
know
who
did
it
but
i
do
understand
i
have
been
trying
all
day
to
think
it
out
i
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
you
need
not
be
i
assured
her
if
necessary
we
will
have
the
city
police
in
a
ring
around
the
house
if
you
know
and
do
tell
margery
you
are
running
a
risk
and
more
than
that
you
are
protecting
a
person
who
ought
to
be
in
jail
i
not
sure
she
persisted
do
ask
me
about
it
please
what
does
butler
say
just
what
she
said
this
morning
and
she
says
valuable
papers
were
taken
from
under
her
pillow
she
was
very
ill
hysterical
all
afternoon
the
gloom
and
smouldering
fire
of
the
came
to
us
from
across
the
hall
i
leaned
over
and
took
margery
small
hand
between
my
two
big
ones
why
do
you
tell
me
i
urged
or
you
need
tell
me
i
know
what
you
think
but
there
is
any
motive
that
i
can
see
and
why
would
she
chloroform
you
i
do
know
margery
shuddered
sometimes
i
wonder
do
you
think
she
is
altogether
sane
the
music
ended
with
the
crash
of
a
minor
chord
fred
and
edith
came
down
the
stairs
and
the
next
moment
we
were
all
together
and
the
chance
for
a
quiet
conversation
was
gone
at
the
door
fred
turned
and
came
back
watch
the
house
he
said
and
by
the
way
i
guess
he
lowered
his
voice
the
lady
story
was
probably
straight
i
looked
around
again
this
afternoon
and
there
are
fresh
scratches
on
the
porch
roof
under
her
window
it
looks
queer
does
it
it
was
a
relief
to
know
that
after
all
butler
was
an
enemy
and
a
dangerous
person
to
nobody
but
herself
she
retired
to
her
room
almost
as
soon
as
fred
and
edith
had
gone
i
was
wondering
whether
or
not
to
tell
margery
about
the
experiment
that
afternoon
debating
how
to
ask
her
what
letters
she
had
got
from
the
postmaster
at
bellwood
addressed
to
miss
jane
and
what
she
knew
of
bella
at
the
same
time
bear
with
me
oh
masculine
reader
the
gentle
reader
will
for
she
cares
a
great
deal
more
for
the
love
story
than
for
all
the
crime
and
mystery
put
together
bear
with
me
i
say
if
i
hold
back
the
account
of
the
terrible
events
that
came
that
night
to
tell
how
beautiful
margery
looked
as
the
lamplight
fell
on
her
brown
hair
and
pure
profile
and
how
the
impulse
came
over
me
to
kiss
her
as
she
sat
there
and
how
i
did
after
all
poor
gentle
reader
and
only
stooped
over
and
kissed
the
pink
palm
of
her
hand
she
did
mind
it
speaking
as
nearly
as
possible
from
an
impersonal
standpoint
i
doubt
if
she
was
even
surprised
you
see
the
ring
was
gone
and
it
had
only
been
an
engagement
ring
anyhow
and
everybody
knows
how
binding
they
are
and
then
an
angel
with
a
burning
sword
came
and
scourged
me
out
of
my
eden
and
the
angel
was
burton
and
the
sword
was
a
dripping
umbrella
i
hate
to
take
you
out
he
said
the
bottom
dropped
out
of
the
sky
but
i
want
you
to
make
a
little
experiment
with
me
he
caught
sight
of
margery
through
the
portières
and
the
imp
of
mischief
in
him
prompted
his
next
speech
she
said
she
must
see
you
he
said
very
distinctly
and
leered
at
me
do
be
an
ass
i
said
angrily
i
do
know
that
i
care
to
go
out
he
changed
his
manner
then
let
go
and
take
a
look
at
the
staircase
you
fellows
have
been
talking
about
he
said
i
do
believe
there
is
a
staircase
there
except
the
main
one
i
have
hounded
every
politician
in
the
city
into
or
out
of
that
joint
and
i
have
never
heard
of
it
i
felt
some
hesitation
about
leaving
the
house
and
margery
after
the
events
of
the
previous
night
but
margery
had
caught
enough
of
the
conversation
to
be
anxious
to
have
me
to
go
and
when
i
went
in
to
consult
her
she
laughed
at
my
fears
lightning
never
strikes
twice
in
the
same
place
she
said
bravely
i
will
ask
katie
to
come
down
with
me
if
i
am
nervous
and
i
shall
wait
up
for
the
family
i
went
without
enthusiasm
margery
departure
had
been
delayed
for
a
day
only
and
i
had
counted
on
the
evening
with
her
in
fact
i
had
sent
the
concert
tickets
to
edith
with
an
eye
single
to
that
idea
but
burton
plan
was
right
it
was
in
view
of
what
we
knew
to
go
over
the
ground
at
the
white
cat
again
and
saturday
night
with
the
place
full
of
men
would
be
a
good
time
to
look
around
unnoticed
i
do
hang
so
much
to
this
staircase
idea
burton
said
and
i
have
a
good
reason
for
it
i
think
we
will
find
it
is
the
warehouse
yet
you
can
depend
on
it
burton
i
maintained
that
the
staircase
is
the
place
to
look
if
you
had
seen
wardrop
face
and
his
agony
of
mind
when
he
knew
he
had
associated
with
you
would
think
just
as
i
do
a
man
like
schwartz
who
knew
the
ropes
could
go
quietly
up
the
stairs
unbolt
the
door
into
the
room
shoot
fleming
and
get
out
wardrop
suspects
schwartz
and
he
afraid
of
him
if
he
opened
the
door
just
in
time
to
see
schwartz
we
will
say
backing
out
the
door
and
going
down
the
stairs
or
to
see
the
door
closing
and
suspect
who
had
just
gone
we
would
have
the
whole
situation
as
i
see
it
including
the
two
motives
of
deadly
hate
and
jealousy
suppose
the
stairs
open
into
the
back
of
the
room
he
was
sitting
facing
the
window
do
you
think
schwartz
would
go
in
walk
around
the
table
and
shoot
him
from
in
front
pooh
fudge
he
had
a
neck
i
retorted
i
suppose
he
might
have
turned
his
head
to
look
around
we
had
been
walking
through
the
rain
the
white
cat
as
far
off
as
the
poles
socially
was
only
a
blocks
actually
from
the
best
residence
portion
of
the
city
at
the
corner
of
the
warehouse
burton
stopped
and
looked
up
at
it
i
always
get
mad
when
i
look
at
this
building
he
said
my
great
grandfather
had
a
truck
garden
on
this
exact
spot
seventy
years
ago
and
the
old
idiot
sold
out
for
three
hundred
dollars
and
a
pair
of
mules
how
do
you
get
in
what
are
you
going
in
for
i
asked
i
was
wondering
if
i
had
a
grudge
i
have
for
that
matter
against
the
mayor
and
i
wanted
to
shoot
him
how
i
would
go
about
it
i
think
i
should
find
a
point
of
vantage
like
an
overlooking
window
in
an
empty
building
like
this
and
i
would
wait
for
a
muggy
night
also
like
this
when
the
windows
were
up
and
the
lights
going
i
could
pot
him
with
a
at
a
dozen
yards
with
my
eyes
crossed
we
had
stopped
near
the
arched
gate
where
i
had
stood
and
waited
for
hunter
a
week
before
suddenly
burton
darted
away
from
me
and
tried
the
gate
it
opened
easily
and
i
heard
him
splashing
through
a
puddle
in
the
gloomy
yard
come
in
he
called
softly
the
water
fine
the
gate
swung
to
behind
me
and
i
could
not
see
six
inches
from
my
nose
burton
caught
my
elbow
and
steered
me
by
touching
the
fence
toward
the
building
if
it
is
locked
too
tight
he
was
saying
we
can
get
in
perhaps
through
a
window
and
get
from
there
we
ought
to
be
able
to
see
down
into
the
club
what
the
devil
that
it
was
a
rat
i
think
and
it
scrambled
away
among
the
loose
boards
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
burton
struck
a
match
it
burned
faintly
in
the
dampness
and
in
a
moment
went
out
having
shown
us
only
the
approximate
location
of
the
heavy
arched
double
doors
a
second
match
showed
us
a
bar
and
a
rusty
padlock
there
was
no
entrance
to
be
gained
in
that
way
the
windows
were
of
the
variety
and
in
better
repair
than
the
ones
on
the
upper
floors
by
good
luck
we
found
one
unlocked
and
not
entirely
closed
it
shrieked
hideously
as
we
pried
it
up
but
an
opportune
clap
of
thunder
covered
the
sound
by
this
time
i
was
ready
for
anything
that
came
i
was
wet
to
my
knees
muddy
disreputable
while
burton
held
the
window
i
crawled
into
the
warehouse
and
turned
to
perform
the
same
service
for
him
at
first
i
could
not
see
him
outside
then
i
heard
his
voice
a
whisper
from
beyond
the
sill
duck
he
said
cop
i
dropped
below
the
window
and
above
the
rain
i
could
hear
the
squash
of
the
watchman
boots
in
the
mud
he
flashed
a
night
lamp
in
at
the
window
next
to
ours
but
he
was
not
very
near
and
the
open
window
escaped
his
notice
i
felt
all
the
nervous
dread
of
a
real
malefactor
and
when
i
heard
the
gate
close
behind
him
and
saw
burton
put
a
leg
over
the
sill
i
was
almost
as
relieved
as
i
would
have
been
had
somebody
family
plate
tied
up
in
a
tablecloth
been
reposing
at
my
feet
burton
had
an
instinct
for
getting
around
in
the
dark
i
lighted
another
match
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
window
and
we
made
out
our
general
direction
toward
where
the
stairs
ought
to
be
when
the
match
went
out
we
felt
our
way
in
the
dark
i
had
only
one
box
of
wax
matches
and
burton
had
dropped
his
in
a
puddle
we
got
to
the
second
floor
finally
and
without
any
worse
mishap
than
burton
banging
his
arm
against
a
wheel
of
some
sort
unlike
the
first
floor
the
second
was
subdivided
into
rooms
it
took
a
dozen
precious
matches
to
find
our
way
to
the
side
of
the
building
overlooking
the
club
and
another
dozen
to
find
the
window
we
wanted
when
we
were
there
at
last
burton
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
sill
and
looked
down
and
across
could
anything
be
better
he
said
there
our
theater
and
we
got
a
proscenium
box
that
room
over
there
stands
out
like
a
he
was
right
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
away
and
perhaps
a
foot
lower
than
our
window
was
the
window
of
the
room
where
fleming
had
been
killed
it
was
empty
as
far
as
we
could
see
the
table
neat
enough
now
was
where
it
had
been
before
directly
under
the
light
any
one
who
sat
there
would
be
an
illuminated
target
from
our
window
not
only
that
but
an
arm
could
be
steadied
on
the
sill
allowing
for
an
almost
perfect
aim
now
where
your
staircase
burton
jeered
the
club
was
evidently
full
of
men
as
he
had
prophesied
above
the
rattle
of
the
rain
came
the
thump
thump
of
the
piano
and
a
male
voices
the
shutters
below
were
closed
we
could
see
nothing
i
think
it
was
then
that
burton
had
his
inspiration
i
bet
you
a
bill
he
said
that
if
i
fire
off
my
revolver
here
now
not
one
of
those
fellows
down
there
would
pay
the
slightest
attention
i
take
that
bet
i
returned
i
wager
that
every
time
anybody
drops
a
poker
since
fleming
was
shot
the
entire
club
turns
out
to
investigate
in
reply
burton
got
out
his
revolver
and
examined
it
by
holding
it
against
the
light
from
across
the
way
i
tell
you
what
i
do
he
said
everybody
down
there
knows
me
i
drop
in
for
a
bottle
of
beer
and
you
fire
a
shot
into
the
floor
here
or
into
somebody
across
if
you
happen
to
see
any
one
you
care
for
i
suggest
that
you
stay
and
fire
the
shot
because
if
you
went
my
friend
and
nobody
heard
it
you
would
accuse
me
of
shooting
from
the
back
of
the
building
somewhere
he
gave
me
the
revolver
and
left
me
with
a
final
injunction
wait
for
ten
minutes
he
said
it
will
take
five
for
me
to
get
out
of
here
and
five
more
to
get
into
the
perhaps
you
better
make
it
fifteen
chapter
xxii
in
the
room
over
the
way
he
went
away
into
the
darkness
and
i
sat
down
on
an
empty
box
by
the
window
and
waited
had
any
one
asked
me
at
that
minute
how
near
we
were
to
the
solution
of
our
double
mystery
i
would
have
said
we
had
made
no
progress
save
by
eliminating
wardrop
not
for
one
instant
did
i
dream
that
i
was
within
less
than
half
an
hour
of
a
revelation
that
changed
my
whole
conception
of
the
crime
i
timed
the
interval
by
using
one
of
my
precious
matches
to
see
my
watch
when
he
left
i
sat
there
for
what
seemed
ten
minutes
listening
to
the
rush
of
the
rain
and
the
creaking
of
a
door
behind
me
in
the
darkness
somewhere
that
swung
back
and
forth
rustily
in
the
draft
from
the
broken
windows
the
gloom
was
infinitely
depressing
away
from
enthusiasm
his
scheme
lacked
point
his
argument
that
the
night
duplicated
the
weather
conditions
of
that
other
night
a
week
ago
seemed
less
worthy
of
consideration
besides
i
have
a
horror
of
making
myself
ridiculous
and
i
had
an
idea
that
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
my
position
alone
in
the
warehouse
firing
a
revolver
into
the
floor
if
my
own
argument
was
right
and
the
club
should
rouse
to
a
search
i
looked
again
at
my
watch
only
six
minutes
eight
minutes
nine
minutes
every
one
who
has
counted
the
passing
of
seconds
knows
how
they
drag
with
my
eyes
on
the
room
across
and
my
finger
on
the
trigger
i
waited
as
best
i
could
at
ten
minutes
i
was
conscious
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
over
the
way
and
then
he
came
into
view
from
the
side
somewhere
and
went
to
the
table
he
had
his
back
to
me
and
i
could
only
see
that
he
was
a
large
man
with
massive
shoulders
and
dark
hair
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
what
he
was
doing
after
a
however
he
stepped
to
one
side
and
i
saw
that
he
had
lighted
a
candle
and
was
systematically
reading
and
then
burning
certain
papers
throwing
the
charred
fragments
on
the
table
with
the
same
glance
that
told
me
that
i
knew
the
man
it
was
schwartz
i
was
so
engrossed
in
watching
him
that
when
he
turned
and
came
directly
to
the
window
i
stood
perfectly
still
staring
at
him
with
the
light
at
his
back
i
felt
certain
i
had
been
discovered
but
i
was
wrong
he
shook
the
newspaper
which
had
held
the
fragments
out
of
the
window
lighted
a
cigarette
and
flung
the
match
out
also
and
turned
back
into
the
room
as
a
second
thought
he
went
back
and
jerked
at
the
cord
of
the
but
it
refused
to
move
he
was
not
alone
for
from
the
window
he
turned
and
addressed
some
one
in
the
room
behind
you
are
sure
you
got
them
all
he
said
the
other
occupant
of
the
room
came
within
range
of
vision
it
was
davidson
all
there
were
schwartz
he
replied
we
were
nearly
finished
before
the
woman
made
a
bolt
he
was
fumbling
in
his
pockets
i
think
i
expected
him
to
produce
an
apple
and
a
penknife
but
he
held
out
a
small
object
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
i
would
rather
have
done
it
alone
schwartz
he
said
i
found
this
ring
in
brigg
pocket
this
morning
it
belongs
to
the
girl
schwartz
swore
and
picking
up
the
ring
held
it
to
the
light
then
he
made
an
angry
motion
to
throw
it
out
of
the
window
but
his
german
cupidity
got
the
better
of
him
he
slid
it
into
his
vest
pocket
instead
you
damned
poor
stuff
davidson
he
said
with
a
snarl
if
she
has
got
them
then
wardrop
has
you
bungle
this
job
and
be
hell
to
pay
tell
mcfeely
i
want
to
see
him
davidson
left
for
i
heard
the
door
close
schwartz
took
the
ring
out
and
held
it
to
the
light
i
looked
at
my
watch
the
time
was
almost
up
a
fresh
burst
of
noise
came
from
below
i
leaned
out
cautiously
and
looked
down
at
the
lower
windows
they
were
still
closed
and
shuttered
when
i
raised
my
eyes
again
to
the
level
of
the
room
across
i
was
amazed
to
see
a
second
figure
in
the
room
a
woman
at
that
schwartz
had
not
seen
her
he
stood
with
his
back
to
her
looking
at
the
ring
in
his
hand
the
woman
had
thrown
her
veil
back
but
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
face
as
she
stood
she
looked
small
beside
towering
height
and
she
wore
black
she
must
have
said
something
just
then
very
quietly
for
schwartz
suddenly
lifted
his
head
and
wheeled
on
her
i
had
a
clear
view
of
him
and
if
ever
guilt
rage
and
fear
showed
on
a
man
face
it
showed
on
his
he
replied
a
words
in
a
low
tone
and
made
a
motion
to
offer
her
a
chair
but
she
paid
no
attention
i
have
no
idea
how
long
a
time
they
talked
the
fresh
outburst
of
noise
below
made
it
impossible
to
hear
what
they
said
and
there
was
always
the
maddening
fact
that
i
could
not
see
her
face
i
thought
of
fleming
but
this
woman
seemed
younger
and
more
slender
schwartz
was
arguing
i
imagined
but
she
stood
immobile
scornful
watching
him
she
seemed
to
have
made
a
request
and
the
man
evasions
moved
her
no
whit
it
may
have
been
only
two
or
three
minutes
but
it
seemed
longer
schwartz
had
given
up
the
argument
whatever
it
was
and
by
pointing
out
the
window
i
supposed
he
was
telling
her
he
had
thrown
what
she
wanted
out
there
even
then
she
did
not
turn
toward
me
i
could
not
see
even
her
profile
what
happened
next
was
so
unexpected
that
it
remains
little
more
than
a
picture
in
my
mind
the
man
threw
out
his
hands
as
if
to
show
he
could
not
or
would
not
accede
to
her
request
he
was
flushed
with
rage
and
even
at
that
distance
the
ugly
scar
on
his
forehead
stood
out
like
a
welt
the
next
moment
i
saw
the
woman
raise
her
right
hand
with
something
in
it
i
yelled
to
schwartz
to
warn
him
but
he
had
already
seen
the
revolver
as
he
struck
her
hand
aside
the
explosion
came
i
saw
her
stagger
clutch
at
a
chair
and
fall
backward
beyond
my
range
of
vision
then
the
light
went
out
and
i
was
staring
at
a
black
brick
wall
i
turned
and
ran
frantically
toward
the
stairs
luckily
i
found
them
easily
i
fell
rather
than
ran
down
to
the
floor
below
then
i
made
a
wrong
turning
and
lost
some
time
my
last
match
set
me
right
and
i
got
into
the
yard
somehow
and
to
the
street
it
was
raining
harder
than
ever
and
the
thunder
was
incessant
i
ran
around
the
corner
of
the
street
and
found
the
gate
to
the
white
cat
without
trouble
the
inner
gate
was
unlocked
as
burton
had
said
he
would
leave
it
and
from
the
steps
of
the
club
i
could
hear
laughter
and
the
refrain
of
a
popular
song
the
door
opened
just
as
i
reached
the
top
step
and
i
inside
burton
was
there
in
the
kitchen
with
two
other
men
whom
i
did
not
recognize
each
one
holding
a
stein
of
beer
burton
had
two
and
he
held
one
out
to
me
as
i
stood
trying
to
get
my
breath
you
win
he
said
although
i
a
journalist
and
need
the
money
i
wo
lie
this
is
osborne
of
the
and
mctighe
of
the
knox
they
heard
the
shot
in
there
and
if
i
had
told
the
story
there
would
have
been
a
panic
what
the
matter
with
you
i
shut
the
door
into
the
and
faced
the
three
men
for
god
sake
burton
i
panted
let
get
quietly
i
did
fire
any
shot
there
a
woman
dead
up
there
with
characteristic
poise
the
three
reporters
took
the
situation
quietly
we
filed
through
the
as
casually
as
we
could
with
the
door
closed
however
we
threw
caution
aside
i
led
the
way
up
the
stairs
to
the
room
where
i
had
found
fleming
body
and
where
i
expected
to
find
another
on
the
landing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
came
face
to
face
with
davidson
the
detective
and
behind
him
judge
mcfeely
davidson
was
trying
to
open
the
door
of
the
room
where
fleming
had
been
shot
with
a
skeleton
key
but
it
was
bolted
inside
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
i
climbed
on
the
shoulders
of
one
of
the
men
a
tall
fellow
whose
face
to
this
day
i
do
remember
and
by
careful
maneuvering
and
the
assistance
of
davidson
long
arms
i
got
through
the
transom
and
dropped
into
the
room
i
hardly
know
what
i
expected
i
was
in
total
darkness
i
know
that
when
i
had
got
the
door
open
at
last
when
the
cheerful
light
from
the
hall
streamed
in
and
i
had
not
felt
schwartz
heavy
hand
at
my
throat
i
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
burton
found
the
electric
light
switch
and
turned
it
on
and
then
i
could
hardly
believe
my
senses
the
room
was
empty
one
of
the
men
laughed
a
little
stung
he
said
lightly
what
sort
of
a
story
have
you
and
your
friend
framed
up
burton
but
i
stopped
at
that
minute
and
picked
up
a
small
revolver
from
the
floor
i
held
it
out
on
my
palm
and
the
others
eyed
it
respectfully
burton
after
all
was
the
of
the
lot
he
threw
open
one
of
the
two
doors
in
the
room
revealing
a
shallow
closet
with
papered
walls
and
a
row
of
hooks
the
other
door
stuck
tight
one
of
the
men
pointed
to
the
floor
a
bit
of
black
cloth
had
wedged
it
from
the
other
side
our
combined
efforts
got
it
open
at
last
and
we
crowded
in
the
doorway
looking
down
a
flight
of
stairs
huddled
just
below
us
her
head
at
our
feet
was
the
body
of
the
missing
woman
my
god
burton
said
hoarsely
who
is
it
chapter
xxiii
a
box
of
crown
derby
we
got
her
into
the
room
and
on
the
couch
before
i
knew
her
her
fair
hair
had
fallen
loose
over
her
face
and
one
long
thin
hand
clutched
still
at
the
bosom
of
her
gown
it
was
ellen
butler
she
was
living
but
not
much
more
we
gathered
around
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
in
helpless
pity
a
current
of
cold
night
air
came
up
the
staircase
from
an
open
door
below
and
set
the
hanging
light
to
swaying
throwing
our
shadows
in
a
sort
of
ghastly
dance
over
her
quiet
face
i
was
too
much
shocked
to
be
surprised
burton
had
picked
up
her
hat
and
put
it
beside
her
she
got
about
an
hour
i
should
say
said
one
of
the
newspaper
men
see
if
gray
is
around
will
you
jim
he
mostly
here
saturday
night
is
it
miss
maitland
burton
asked
in
a
strangely
subdued
voice
no
it
is
henry
butler
widow
i
returned
and
the
three
men
were
reporters
again
at
once
gray
was
there
and
came
immediately
whatever
surprise
he
may
have
felt
at
seeing
a
woman
there
and
dying
he
made
no
comment
he
said
she
might
live
six
hours
but
the
end
was
certain
we
got
a
hospital
ambulance
and
with
the
clang
of
its
bell
as
it
turned
the
corner
and
hurried
away
the
white
cat
drops
out
of
this
story
so
far
as
action
is
concerned
three
detectives
and
as
many
reporters
hunted
schwartz
all
of
that
night
and
the
next
day
to
get
his
story
but
he
remained
in
hiding
he
had
a
start
of
over
an
hour
from
the
time
he
switched
off
the
light
and
escaped
down
the
staircase
even
in
her
agony
ellen
hate
had
carried
her
through
the
doorway
after
him
to
collapse
on
the
stairs
i
got
home
just
as
the
cab
with
fred
and
edith
stopped
at
the
door
i
did
not
let
them
get
out
a
half
dozen
words
without
comment
or
explanation
and
they
were
driving
madly
to
the
hospital
katie
let
me
in
and
i
gave
her
some
money
to
stay
up
and
watch
the
place
while
we
were
away
then
not
finding
a
cab
i
took
a
car
and
rode
to
the
hospital
the
building
was
appallingly
quiet
the
elevator
cage
without
a
light
crept
spectrally
up
and
down
my
footsteps
on
the
tiled
floor
echoed
and
reëchoed
above
my
head
a
night
watchman
in
felt
shoes
admitted
me
and
took
me
there
was
another
long
wait
while
the
surgeon
finished
his
examination
and
a
nurse
with
a
basin
of
water
and
some
towels
came
out
of
the
room
and
another
one
with
dressings
went
in
and
then
the
surgeon
came
out
in
a
white
coat
with
the
sleeves
rolled
above
his
elbows
and
said
i
might
go
in
the
cover
was
drawn
up
to
the
injured
woman
chin
where
it
was
folded
neatly
back
her
face
was
bloodless
and
her
fair
hair
had
been
gathered
up
in
a
shaggy
knot
she
was
breathing
slowly
but
regularly
and
her
expression
was
relaxed
more
restful
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
as
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
looked
down
at
her
i
knew
that
as
surely
as
death
was
coming
it
would
be
welcome
edith
had
been
calm
before
but
when
she
saw
me
she
lost
her
she
put
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
sobbed
out
the
shock
and
the
horror
of
the
thing
as
for
fred
his
imaginative
temperament
made
him
particularly
sensitive
to
suffering
in
others
as
he
sat
there
beside
the
bed
i
knew
by
his
face
that
he
was
repeating
and
repenting
every
unkind
word
he
had
said
about
ellen
butler
she
was
conscious
we
realized
that
after
a
time
once
she
asked
for
water
without
opening
her
eyes
and
fred
slipped
a
bit
of
ice
between
her
white
lips
later
in
the
night
she
looked
up
for
an
instant
at
me
he
struck
my
hand
she
said
with
difficulty
and
closed
her
eyes
again
during
the
long
night
hours
i
told
the
story
as
i
knew
it
in
an
undertone
and
there
was
a
new
kindliness
in
fred
face
as
he
looked
at
her
she
was
still
living
by
morning
and
was
rallying
a
little
from
the
shock
i
got
fred
to
take
edith
home
and
i
took
her
place
by
the
bed
some
one
brought
me
coffee
about
eight
and
at
nine
i
was
asked
to
leave
the
room
while
four
surgeons
held
a
consultation
there
the
decision
to
operate
was
made
shortly
after
there
is
only
a
chance
a
surgeon
told
me
in
brisk
words
the
bullet
went
down
and
has
penetrated
the
abdomen
sometimes
taken
early
enough
we
can
repair
the
damage
to
a
certain
extent
and
nature
does
the
rest
the
family
is
willing
i
suppose
i
knew
of
no
family
but
edith
and
over
the
telephone
she
said
with
something
of
her
natural
tone
to
do
what
the
surgeons
considered
best
i
hoped
to
get
some
sort
of
statement
before
the
injured
woman
was
taken
to
the
but
she
lay
in
a
stupor
and
i
had
to
give
up
the
idea
it
was
two
days
before
i
got
her
deposition
and
in
that
time
i
had
learned
many
things
on
monday
i
took
margery
to
bellwood
she
had
received
the
news
about
butler
more
calmly
than
i
had
expected
i
do
not
think
she
was
quite
sane
poor
woman
she
said
with
a
shudder
she
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
but
how
strange
a
murder
and
an
attempt
at
murder
at
that
little
club
in
a
week
she
did
not
connect
the
two
and
i
let
the
thing
rest
at
that
once
on
the
train
she
turned
to
me
suddenly
after
she
had
been
plunged
in
thought
for
several
minutes
do
you
think
she
asked
that
she
had
a
sort
of
homicidal
mania
and
that
she
tried
to
kill
me
with
chloroform
i
hardly
think
so
i
returned
evasively
i
am
inclined
to
think
some
one
actually
got
in
over
the
porch
roof
i
am
afraid
she
said
pressing
her
gloved
hands
tight
together
wherever
i
go
something
happens
that
i
can
not
understand
i
never
wilfully
hurt
any
one
and
yet
these
terrible
things
follow
me
i
am
afraid
to
go
back
to
bellwood
with
aunt
jane
still
gone
and
you
in
the
city
a
lot
of
help
i
have
been
to
you
i
retorted
bitterly
can
you
think
of
a
single
instance
where
i
have
been
able
to
save
you
trouble
or
anxiety
why
i
allowed
you
to
be
chloroformed
within
an
inch
of
eternity
before
i
found
you
but
you
did
find
me
she
cheered
me
and
just
to
know
that
you
are
doing
all
you
can
my
poor
best
i
supplemented
it
is
very
comforting
to
have
a
friend
one
can
rely
on
she
finished
and
the
little
bit
of
kindness
went
to
my
head
if
she
had
not
got
a
cinder
in
her
eye
at
that
psychological
moment
i
afraid
i
would
figuratively
have
trampled
wardrop
underfoot
right
there
as
it
was
i
got
the
cinder
after
a
great
deal
of
looking
into
one
beautiful
eye
which
is
not
as
satisfactory
by
half
as
looking
into
two
and
then
we
were
at
bellwood
we
found
miss
letitia
in
the
lower
hall
and
heppie
on
her
knees
with
a
hatchet
between
them
sat
a
packing
box
and
they
were
having
a
spirited
discussion
as
to
how
it
should
be
opened
here
give
it
to
me
miss
letitia
demanded
as
we
stopped
in
the
doorway
you
got
stove
lengths
there
for
two
days
if
you
do
chop
up
into
splinters
with
the
hatchet
poised
in
mid
air
she
saw
us
but
she
let
it
descend
with
considerable
accuracy
nevertheless
and
our
greeting
was
made
between
thumps
come
in
thump
like
as
not
it
a
mistake
bang
but
the
expressage
was
prepaid
if
it
mineral
water
crash
something
broke
inside
if
it
mineral
water
i
said
you
better
let
me
open
it
mineral
water
is
meant
for
internal
use
and
not
for
hall
carpets
i
got
the
hatchet
from
her
gradually
i
knew
a
case
once
where
a
bottle
of
hair
tonic
was
spilled
on
a
rag
carpet
and
in
a
year
they
had
it
dyed
with
spots
over
it
and
called
it
a
tiger
skin
she
watched
me
suspiciously
while
i
straightened
the
nails
she
had
bent
and
lifted
the
boards
in
the
matter
of
curiosity
miss
letitia
was
truly
feminine
great
handfuls
of
excelsior
she
dragged
out
herself
and
heaped
on
heppie
blue
apron
stretched
out
on
the
floor
the
article
that
had
smashed
under
the
vigor
of
miss
letitia
seventy
years
lay
on
the
top
it
had
been
a
of
some
very
beautiful
ware
i
have
called
just
now
from
my
study
to
ask
what
sort
of
ware
it
was
and
the
lady
who
sets
me
right
says
it
was
crown
derby
then
there
were
rows
of
cups
and
saucers
and
heterogeneous
articles
in
the
same
material
that
the
women
folk
seemed
to
understand
at
the
last
when
the
excitement
seemed
over
they
found
a
toast
rack
in
a
lower
corner
of
the
box
and
the
ohs
and
ahs
had
to
be
done
all
over
again
not
until
miss
letitia
had
arranged
it
all
on
the
table
and
margery
had
taken
off
her
wraps
and
admired
from
all
four
corners
did
miss
letitia
begin
to
ask
where
they
had
come
from
and
by
that
time
heppie
had
the
crate
in
the
and
the
excelsior
was
a
black
and
smoking
mass
at
the
kitchen
end
of
the
grounds
there
was
not
the
slightest
clue
to
the
sender
but
while
miss
letitia
rated
heppie
loudly
in
the
kitchen
and
bella
swept
up
the
hall
margery
voiced
the
same
idea
that
had
occurred
to
me
if
if
aunt
jane
were
all
right
she
said
tremulously
it
would
be
just
the
sort
of
thing
she
loves
to
do
i
had
intended
to
go
back
to
the
city
at
once
but
miss
letitia
box
had
put
her
in
an
almost
cheerful
humor
and
she
insisted
that
i
go
with
her
to
miss
jane
room
and
see
how
it
was
prepared
for
its
return
i
not
pretending
to
know
what
took
jane
maitland
away
from
this
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
said
she
was
a
good
bit
of
a
fool
jane
was
she
never
grew
up
but
if
i
know
jane
maitland
she
will
come
back
and
be
buried
with
her
people
if
it
only
to
put
mary
husband
out
of
the
end
of
the
lot
and
another
thing
knox
she
went
on
and
i
saw
her
old
hands
were
shaking
i
told
you
the
last
time
you
were
here
that
i
had
been
robbed
of
any
of
the
pearls
after
all
half
of
those
pearls
were
and
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
take
of
them
if
she
wanted
she
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
take
some
and
it
slipped
my
mind
i
believe
it
was
the
first
lie
she
had
ever
told
in
her
hard
conscientious
old
life
was
she
right
i
wondered
had
miss
jane
taken
the
pearls
and
if
she
had
why
wardrop
had
been
taking
a
long
walk
he
got
back
about
five
and
as
miss
letitia
was
in
the
middle
of
a
diatribe
against
white
undergarments
for
colored
children
margery
and
he
had
a
alone
together
i
had
known
of
course
that
it
must
come
but
under
the
circumstances
with
my
whole
future
existence
at
stake
i
was
vague
as
to
whether
it
was
colored
undergarments
on
white
orphans
or
the
other
way
round
when
i
got
away
at
last
i
found
bella
waiting
for
me
in
the
hall
her
eyes
were
red
with
crying
and
she
had
a
crumpled
newspaper
in
her
hand
she
broke
down
when
she
tried
to
speak
but
i
got
the
newspaper
from
her
and
she
pointed
with
one
finger
to
a
column
on
the
first
page
it
was
the
announcement
of
butler
tragic
accident
and
the
mystery
that
surrounded
it
there
was
no
mention
of
schwartz
is
she
dead
bella
choked
out
at
last
not
yet
but
there
is
very
little
hope
amid
fresh
tears
and
shakings
of
her
heavy
shoulders
as
she
sat
in
her
favorite
place
on
the
stairs
bella
told
me
briefly
that
she
had
lived
with
butler
since
she
was
sixteen
and
had
only
left
when
the
husband
suicide
had
broken
up
the
home
i
could
get
nothing
else
out
of
her
but
gradually
bella
share
in
the
mystery
was
coming
to
light
slowly
too
it
was
a
new
business
for
me
i
was
forming
a
theory
of
my
own
it
was
a
strange
one
but
it
seemed
to
fit
the
facts
as
i
knew
them
with
the
story
wardrop
told
that
afternoon
came
my
first
glimmer
of
light
he
was
looking
better
than
he
had
when
i
saw
him
before
but
the
news
of
butler
approaching
death
and
the
manner
of
her
injury
affected
him
strangely
he
had
seen
the
paper
like
bella
and
he
turned
on
me
almost
fiercely
when
i
entered
the
library
margery
was
in
her
old
position
at
the
window
looking
out
and
i
knew
the
despondent
droop
of
her
shoulders
is
she
conscious
wardrop
asked
eagerly
indicating
the
article
in
the
paper
no
not
now
at
least
it
is
not
likely
he
looked
relieved
at
that
but
only
for
a
moment
then
he
began
to
pace
the
room
nervously
evidently
debating
some
move
his
next
action
showed
the
development
of
a
resolution
for
he
pushed
forward
two
chairs
for
margery
and
myself
sit
down
both
of
you
he
directed
i
got
a
lot
to
say
and
i
want
you
both
to
listen
when
margery
has
heard
the
whole
story
she
will
probably
despise
me
for
the
rest
of
her
life
i
ca
help
it
i
got
to
tell
all
i
know
and
it
is
so
much
after
all
you
did
fool
me
yesterday
knox
i
knew
what
that
doctor
was
after
but
he
could
make
me
tell
who
killed
fleming
because
before
god
i
did
know
chapter
xxiv
wardrop
story
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
night
miss
jane
disappeared
and
another
thing
that
has
driven
me
desperate
will
you
tell
me
why
i
should
be
suspected
of
having
a
hand
in
that
when
she
had
been
a
mother
to
me
if
she
is
dead
she
ca
exonerate
me
if
she
is
living
and
we
find
her
she
will
tell
you
what
i
tell
you
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
whole
terrible
business
i
am
quite
certain
of
that
wardrop
i
interposed
besides
i
think
i
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
that
mystery
margery
looked
at
me
quickly
but
i
shook
my
head
it
was
too
early
to
tell
my
suspicions
the
things
that
looked
black
against
me
were
bad
enough
but
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
miss
jane
i
will
have
to
go
back
to
before
the
night
she
went
away
back
to
the
time
butler
was
the
state
treasurer
and
your
father
margery
was
his
cashier
butler
was
not
a
business
man
he
let
too
much
responsibility
lie
with
his
subordinates
and
then
according
to
the
story
he
could
do
much
anyhow
against
schwartz
the
cashier
was
entirely
under
machine
control
and
butler
was
neglectful
you
remember
knox
the
crash
when
three
banks
rotten
to
the
core
went
under
and
it
was
found
a
large
amount
of
state
money
had
gone
too
it
was
fleming
who
did
it
i
am
sorry
margery
but
this
is
no
time
to
mince
words
it
was
fleming
who
deposited
the
money
in
the
wrecked
banks
knowing
what
would
happen
when
the
crash
came
butler
sureties
to
save
themselves
confiscated
every
dollar
he
had
in
the
world
butler
went
to
the
penitentiary
for
six
months
on
some
minor
count
and
when
he
got
out
after
writing
to
fleming
and
schwartz
protesting
his
innocence
and
asking
for
enough
out
of
the
fortune
they
had
robbed
him
of
to
support
his
wife
he
killed
himself
at
the
white
cat
margery
was
very
pale
but
quiet
she
sat
with
her
fingers
locked
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
on
wardrop
it
was
a
bad
business
wardrop
went
on
wearily
fleming
moved
into
butler
place
as
treasurer
and
took
lightfoot
as
his
cashier
that
kept
the
lid
on
once
or
twice
when
there
was
an
unexpected
call
for
funds
the
treasury
was
almost
empty
and
schwartz
carried
things
over
himself
i
went
to
plattsburg
as
fleming
private
secretary
when
he
became
treasurer
and
from
the
first
i
knew
things
were
even
worse
than
the
average
state
government
schwartz
and
fleming
had
to
hold
together
they
hated
each
other
and
the
feeling
was
trebled
when
fleming
married
schwartz
divorced
wife
margery
looked
at
me
with
startled
incredulous
eyes
what
she
must
have
seen
confirmed
wardrop
words
and
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
limp
and
unnerved
but
she
heard
and
comprehended
every
word
wardrop
was
saying
the
woman
was
a
very
ordinary
person
but
it
seems
schwartz
cared
for
her
and
he
tried
to
stab
fleming
shortly
after
the
marriage
about
a
year
ago
fleming
said
another
attempt
had
been
made
on
his
life
with
poison
he
was
very
much
alarmed
and
i
noticed
a
change
in
him
from
that
time
on
things
were
not
going
well
at
the
treasury
schwartz
and
his
crowd
were
making
demands
that
were
hard
to
supply
and
behind
all
that
fleming
was
afraid
to
go
out
alone
at
night
he
employed
a
man
to
protect
him
a
man
named
carter
who
had
been
a
bartender
in
plattsburg
when
things
began
to
happen
here
in
manchester
he
took
carter
to
the
home
as
a
butler
then
the
borough
bank
got
shaky
if
it
went
down
there
would
be
an
ugly
scandal
and
fleming
would
go
too
his
notes
for
half
a
million
were
there
without
security
and
he
dared
not
show
the
canceled
notes
he
had
with
schwartz
indorsement
i
not
proud
of
the
rest
of
the
story
margery
he
stopped
his
nervous
pacing
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
i
was
engaged
to
marry
a
girl
who
was
everything
on
earth
to
me
and
i
was
private
secretary
to
the
state
treasurer
with
the
princely
salary
of
such
a
position
fleming
came
back
here
when
the
borough
bank
threatened
failure
and
tried
to
get
money
enough
to
tide
over
the
trouble
a
half
million
would
have
done
it
but
he
could
get
it
he
was
in
butler
position
exactly
only
he
was
guilty
and
butler
was
innocent
he
raised
a
little
money
here
and
i
went
to
plattsburg
with
securities
and
letters
it
is
necessary
to
go
over
the
things
i
suffered
there
i
brought
back
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars
in
a
package
in
my
russia
leather
bag
and
i
had
something
else
he
wavered
for
the
first
time
in
his
recital
he
went
on
more
rapidly
and
without
looking
at
either
of
us
i
carried
not
in
the
valise
a
bundle
of
letters
five
in
all
which
had
been
written
by
henry
butler
to
fleming
letters
that
showed
what
a
dupe
butler
had
been
that
he
had
been
negligent
but
not
criminal
accusing
fleming
of
having
ruined
him
and
demanding
certain
notes
that
would
have
proved
it
if
butler
could
have
produced
the
letters
at
the
time
of
his
trial
things
would
have
been
different
were
you
going
to
sell
the
letters
margery
demanded
with
quick
scorn
i
intended
to
but
i
did
it
was
a
little
bit
too
dirty
after
all
i
met
butler
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
at
the
gate
down
there
as
i
came
up
from
the
train
the
night
i
got
here
from
plattsburg
she
had
offered
to
buy
the
letters
and
i
had
brought
them
to
sell
to
her
and
then
at
the
last
minute
i
lied
i
said
i
could
get
them
that
they
were
locked
in
the
monmouth
avenue
house
i
put
her
in
a
taxicab
that
she
had
waiting
and
she
went
back
to
town
i
felt
like
a
cad
she
wanted
to
clear
her
husband
memory
and
i
well
fleming
was
your
father
margery
i
could
hurt
you
like
that
do
you
think
butler
took
your
leather
bag
i
asked
i
do
not
think
so
it
seems
to
be
the
only
explanation
but
i
did
not
let
it
out
of
my
hand
one
moment
while
we
were
talking
my
hand
was
cramped
from
holding
it
when
she
gave
up
in
despair
at
last
and
went
back
to
the
city
what
did
you
do
with
the
letters
she
wanted
i
kept
them
with
me
that
night
and
the
next
morning
hid
them
in
the
secret
closet
that
was
when
i
dropped
my
fountain
pen
and
the
pearls
margery
asked
suddenly
when
did
you
get
them
harry
to
my
surprise
his
face
did
not
change
he
appeared
to
be
thinking
two
days
before
i
left
he
said
we
were
using
every
method
to
get
money
and
your
father
said
to
sacrifice
them
if
necessary
my
father
he
wheeled
on
us
both
did
you
think
i
stole
them
he
demanded
and
i
confess
that
i
was
ashamed
to
say
i
had
thought
precisely
that
your
father
gave
me
nine
unmounted
pearls
to
sell
he
reiterated
i
got
about
a
thousand
dollars
for
them
eleven
hundred
and
something
i
believe
margery
looked
at
me
i
think
she
was
fairly
stunned
to
learn
that
her
father
had
married
again
that
he
had
been
the
keystone
in
an
arch
of
villainy
that
with
him
gone
was
now
about
to
fall
and
to
associate
him
with
so
small
and
mean
a
thing
as
the
theft
of
a
handful
of
pearls
she
was
fairly
stunned
then
i
said
to
bring
wardrop
back
to
his
story
you
found
you
had
been
robbed
of
the
money
and
you
went
in
to
tell
fleming
you
had
some
words
did
you
he
thought
what
you
all
thought
wardrop
said
bitterly
he
accused
me
of
stealing
the
money
i
felt
worse
than
a
thief
he
was
desperate
and
i
took
his
revolver
from
him
margery
had
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
it
was
a
terrible
strain
for
her
but
when
i
suggested
that
she
wait
for
the
rest
of
the
story
she
refused
vehemently
i
came
back
here
to
bellwood
and
the
first
thing
i
learned
was
about
miss
jane
when
i
saw
the
blood
print
on
the
stair
rail
i
thought
she
was
murdered
and
i
had
more
than
i
could
stand
i
took
the
letters
out
of
the
secret
closet
before
i
could
show
it
to
you
and
hunter
and
later
i
put
them
in
the
leather
bag
i
gave
you
and
locked
it
you
have
it
have
you
knox
i
nodded
as
for
that
night
at
the
club
i
told
the
truth
then
but
not
all
the
truth
i
suppose
i
am
a
coward
but
i
was
afraid
to
if
you
knew
schwartz
you
would
understand
with
the
memory
of
his
huge
figure
and
the
heavy
face
that
i
had
seen
the
night
before
i
could
understand
very
well
knowing
wardrop
i
went
to
that
room
at
the
white
cat
that
night
because
i
was
afraid
not
to
go
fleming
might
kill
himself
or
some
one
else
i
went
up
the
stairs
slowly
and
i
heard
no
shot
at
the
door
i
hesitated
then
opened
it
quietly
the
door
into
the
staircase
was
just
closing
it
must
have
taken
me
only
an
instant
to
realize
what
had
happened
fleming
was
swaying
forward
as
i
caught
him
i
jumped
to
the
staircase
and
looked
down
but
i
was
too
late
the
door
below
had
closed
i
knew
in
another
minute
who
had
been
there
and
escaped
it
was
raining
you
remember
and
schwartz
had
forgotten
to
take
his
umbrella
with
his
name
on
the
handle
schwartz
now
do
you
understand
why
i
was
being
followed
he
demanded
i
have
been
under
surveillance
every
minute
since
that
night
there
probably
some
one
hanging
around
the
gate
now
anyhow
i
was
frantic
i
saw
how
it
looked
for
me
and
if
i
had
brought
schwartz
into
it
i
would
have
been
knifed
in
hours
i
hardly
remember
what
i
did
i
know
i
ran
for
a
doctor
and
i
took
the
umbrella
with
me
and
left
it
in
the
vestibule
of
the
first
house
i
saw
with
a
doctor
sign
i
rang
the
bell
like
a
crazy
man
and
then
hunter
came
along
and
said
to
go
back
doctor
gray
was
at
the
club
that
is
all
i
know
i
not
proud
of
it
margery
but
it
might
have
been
worse
and
it
the
truth
it
clears
up
something
but
not
all
it
does
tell
where
aunt
jane
is
or
who
has
the
hundred
thousand
but
it
does
show
who
killed
your
father
and
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
you
knox
you
will
let
it
go
at
that
you
ca
fight
the
police
and
the
courts
look
how
the
whole
thing
was
dropped
and
the
most
kind
of
murder
turned
into
suicide
suicide
without
a
weapon
bah
i
am
not
so
sure
about
schwartz
i
said
thoughtfully
we
have
yet
learned
about
eleven
chapter
xxv
measure
for
measure
miss
jane
maitland
had
been
missing
for
ten
days
in
that
time
not
one
word
had
come
from
her
the
reporter
from
the
had
located
her
in
a
dozen
places
and
was
growing
thin
and
haggard
following
little
old
ladies
along
the
street
and
being
sent
about
his
business
tartly
when
he
tried
to
make
inquiries
some
things
puzzled
me
more
than
ever
in
the
light
of
wardrop
story
for
the
third
time
i
asked
myself
why
miss
letitia
denied
the
loss
of
the
pearls
there
was
nothing
in
what
we
had
learned
either
to
tell
why
miss
jane
had
gone
away
to
ascribe
a
motive
how
she
had
gone
in
view
of
wardrop
story
of
the
cab
was
clear
she
had
gone
by
walking
the
three
miles
to
wynton
alone
at
two
in
the
morning
although
she
had
never
stirred
around
the
house
at
night
without
a
candle
and
was
privately
known
to
sleep
with
a
light
when
miss
letitia
went
to
bed
first
and
could
not
see
it
through
the
transom
the
theory
i
had
formed
seemed
absurd
at
first
but
as
i
thought
it
over
its
probabilities
grew
on
me
i
took
dinner
at
bellwood
and
started
for
town
almost
immediately
after
margery
had
gone
to
miss
letitia
room
and
wardrop
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
veranda
smoking
he
looked
dejected
and
anxious
and
he
welcomed
my
suggestion
that
he
walk
down
to
the
station
with
me
as
we
went
a
man
emerged
from
the
trees
across
and
came
slowly
after
us
you
see
i
am
only
nominally
a
free
agent
he
said
morosely
poison
me
yet
i
know
too
much
we
said
little
on
the
way
to
the
train
just
before
it
came
thundering
along
however
he
spoke
again
i
am
going
away
knox
there
is
anything
in
this
political
game
for
me
and
the
law
is
too
long
i
have
a
chum
in
mexico
and
he
wants
me
to
go
down
there
permanently
yes
there
nothing
to
hold
me
here
now
he
said
i
turned
and
faced
him
in
the
glare
of
the
station
lights
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
i
mean
that
there
is
any
longer
a
reason
why
one
part
of
the
earth
is
better
than
another
mexico
or
alaska
it
all
the
same
to
me
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
me
i
watched
him
swing
up
the
path
with
his
head
down
i
saw
the
shadowy
figure
of
the
other
man
fall
into
line
behind
him
then
i
caught
the
platform
of
the
last
car
as
it
passed
and
that
short
ride
into
town
was
a
triumphal
procession
with
the
wheels
beating
time
and
singing
it
all
the
same
the
same
to
me
to
me
i
called
burton
by
telephone
and
was
lucky
enough
to
find
him
at
the
office
he
said
he
had
just
got
in
and
as
usual
he
wanted
something
to
eat
we
arranged
to
meet
at
a
little
chinese
restaurant
where
at
that
hour
nine
we
would
be
almost
alone
later
on
after
the
theater
i
knew
that
the
place
would
be
full
of
people
and
conversation
impossible
burton
knew
the
place
well
as
he
did
every
restaurant
in
the
city
hello
mike
he
said
to
the
unctuous
chinaman
who
admitted
us
and
mike
smiled
a
welcome
the
room
was
empty
it
was
an
unpretentious
affair
with
lace
curtains
at
the
windows
and
small
very
clean
tables
at
one
corner
a
cable
and
slide
communicated
through
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
with
the
floor
above
and
through
the
aperture
burton
order
for
chicken
and
rice
and
the
inevitable
tea
was
barked
burton
listened
attentively
to
wardrop
story
as
i
repeated
it
so
schwartz
did
it
after
all
he
said
regretfully
when
i
finished
it
a
tame
ending
it
had
all
the
elements
of
the
unusual
and
it
resolves
itself
into
an
ordinary
feud
disappointed
we
ca
touch
schwartz
i
thought
the
was
hot
after
him
schwartz
bought
the
at
three
this
afternoon
burton
said
with
repressed
rage
i
called
off
we
run
a
photograph
of
schwartzwold
his
place
at
plattsburg
and
the
next
day
we
eulogize
the
administration
i
going
down
the
river
on
an
excursion
boat
and
write
up
the
contest
at
the
union
picnic
how
is
mrs
butler
i
asked
as
his
rage
subsided
to
mere
rumbling
in
his
throat
delirious
shortly
she
going
to
croak
wardrop
going
to
mexico
schwartz
will
be
next
governor
and
miss
maitland
body
will
be
found
in
a
cistern
the
whole
thing
has
petered
out
what
the
use
of
finding
the
murderer
if
he
coated
with
asbestos
and
lined
with
money
mike
i
want
some
more
tea
to
drown
my
troubles
we
called
up
the
hospital
about
and
learned
that
butler
was
sinking
fred
was
there
and
without
much
hope
of
getting
anything
we
went
over
i
took
burton
in
as
a
nephew
of
the
dying
woman
and
i
was
glad
i
had
done
it
she
was
quite
conscious
but
very
weak
she
told
the
story
to
fred
and
myself
and
in
a
corner
burton
took
it
down
in
shorthand
we
got
her
to
sign
it
about
daylight
sometime
and
she
died
very
quietly
shortly
after
edith
arrived
at
eight
to
give
her
story
as
she
gave
it
would
be
impossible
the
ramblings
of
a
sick
mind
the
terrible
pathos
of
it
all
is
impossible
to
repeat
she
lay
there
her
long
thin
body
practically
dead
fighting
the
death
rattle
in
her
throat
there
were
pauses
when
for
five
minutes
she
would
lie
in
a
stupor
only
to
rouse
and
go
forward
from
the
very
word
where
she
had
stopped
she
began
with
her
married
life
and
to
understand
the
beauty
of
it
is
to
understand
the
things
that
came
after
she
was
perfectly
ideally
illogically
happy
then
one
day
henry
butler
accepted
the
nomination
for
state
treasurer
and
with
that
things
changed
during
his
term
in
office
he
altered
greatly
his
wife
could
only
guess
that
things
were
wrong
for
he
refused
to
talk
the
crash
came
after
all
with
terrible
suddenness
there
had
been
an
conference
at
the
butler
home
and
butler
in
a
frenzy
at
finding
himself
a
dupe
had
called
the
butler
from
bed
and
forcibly
ejected
fleming
and
schwartz
from
the
house
ellen
butler
had
been
horrified
sickened
by
what
she
regarded
as
the
vulgarity
of
the
occurrence
but
her
loyalty
to
her
husband
never
wavered
butler
was
one
honest
man
against
a
complete
organization
of
unscrupulous
ones
his
disgrace
imprisonment
and
suicide
at
the
white
cat
had
followed
in
rapid
succession
with
his
death
all
that
was
worth
while
in
his
wife
died
her
health
was
destroyed
she
became
one
of
the
wretched
army
of
neurasthenics
with
only
one
idea
to
retaliate
to
pay
back
in
measure
full
and
running
over
her
wrecked
life
her
dead
husband
her
grief
and
her
shame
she
laid
her
plans
with
the
caution
and
absolute
recklessness
of
a
diseased
mentality
normally
a
shrinking
nervous
woman
she
became
cold
passionless
deliberate
in
her
revenge
to
disgrace
schwartz
and
fleming
was
her
original
intention
but
she
could
not
get
the
papers
she
resorted
to
hounding
fleming
meaning
to
drive
him
to
suicide
and
she
chose
a
method
that
had
more
nearly
driven
him
to
madness
wherever
he
turned
he
found
the
figures
eleven
sometimes
just
the
number
without
the
letter
it
had
been
henry
butler
cell
number
during
his
imprisonment
and
if
they
were
graven
on
his
wife
soul
they
burned
themselves
in
lines
of
fire
on
fleming
brain
for
over
a
year
she
pursued
this
course
sometimes
through
the
mail
at
other
times
in
the
most
unexpected
places
wherever
she
could
bribe
a
messenger
to
carry
the
paper
sane
no
hardly
sane
but
inevitable
as
fate
the
time
came
when
other
things
went
badly
with
fleming
as
i
had
already
heard
from
wardrop
he
fled
to
the
white
cat
and
for
a
week
ellen
butler
hunted
him
vainly
she
had
decided
to
kill
him
and
on
the
night
margery
fleming
had
found
the
paper
on
the
pillow
she
had
been
in
the
house
she
was
not
the
only
intruder
in
the
house
that
night
some
one
presumably
fleming
himself
had
been
there
before
her
she
found
a
ladies
desk
broken
open
and
a
small
drawer
empty
evidently
fleming
unable
to
draw
a
check
while
in
hiding
had
needed
ready
money
as
to
the
jewels
that
had
been
disturbed
in
margery
boudoir
i
could
only
surmise
the
impulse
that
after
prompting
him
to
take
them
had
failed
at
the
sight
of
his
dead
wife
jewels
surprised
by
the
appearance
she
had
crept
to
the
upper
floor
and
concealed
herself
in
an
empty
bedroom
it
had
been
almost
dawn
before
she
got
out
no
doubt
this
was
the
room
belonging
to
the
butler
carter
which
margery
had
reported
as
locked
that
night
she
took
a
key
from
the
door
of
a
side
entrance
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
when
she
left
within
a
couple
of
nights
she
had
learned
that
wardrop
was
coming
home
from
plattsburg
and
she
met
him
at
bellwood
we
already
knew
the
nature
of
that
meeting
she
drove
back
to
town
half
maddened
by
her
failure
to
secure
the
letters
that
would
have
cleared
her
husband
memory
but
the
wiser
by
one
thing
wardrop
had
inadvertently
told
her
where
fleming
was
hiding
the
next
night
she
went
to
the
white
cat
and
tried
to
get
in
she
knew
from
her
husband
of
the
secret
staircase
for
many
a
political
meeting
of
the
deepest
significance
had
been
possible
by
its
use
but
the
door
was
locked
and
she
had
no
key
above
her
the
warehouse
raised
its
empty
height
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
decided
to
see
what
she
could
learn
from
its
upper
windows
she
went
in
at
the
gate
and
felt
her
way
through
the
rain
to
the
windows
at
that
moment
the
gate
opened
suddenly
and
a
man
muttered
something
in
the
darkness
the
shock
was
terrible
i
had
no
idea
that
night
of
what
my
innocent
stumbling
into
the
warehouse
yard
had
meant
to
a
woman
just
beyond
my
range
of
vision
after
a
little
she
got
her
courage
again
and
she
pried
up
an
unlocked
window
the
rest
of
her
progress
must
have
been
much
as
ours
had
been
a
few
nights
later
she
found
a
window
that
commanded
the
club
and
with
three
possibilities
that
she
would
lose
and
would
see
the
wrong
room
she
won
the
fourth
the
room
lay
directly
before
her
distinct
in
every
outline
with
fleming
seated
at
the
table
facing
her
and
sorting
some
papers
she
rested
her
revolver
on
the
sill
and
took
absolutely
deliberate
aim
her
hands
were
cold
and
she
even
rubbed
them
together
to
make
them
steady
then
she
fired
and
a
crash
of
thunder
at
the
very
instant
covered
the
sound
fleming
sat
for
a
moment
before
he
swayed
forward
on
that
instant
she
realized
that
there
was
some
one
else
in
the
room
a
man
who
took
an
uncertain
step
or
two
forward
into
view
threw
up
his
hands
and
disappeared
as
silently
as
he
had
come
it
was
schwartz
then
she
saw
the
door
into
the
hall
open
saw
wardrop
come
slowly
in
and
close
it
watched
his
sickening
realization
of
what
had
occurred
then
a
sudden
panic
seized
her
arms
seemed
to
stretch
out
from
the
darkness
behind
her
to
draw
her
into
it
she
tried
to
get
away
to
run
even
to
scream
then
she
fainted
it
was
gray
dawn
when
she
recovered
her
senses
and
got
back
to
the
hotel
room
she
had
taken
under
an
assumed
name
by
night
she
was
quieter
she
read
the
news
of
fleming
death
in
the
papers
and
she
gloated
over
it
but
there
was
more
to
be
done
she
was
only
beginning
she
meant
to
ruin
schwartz
to
kill
his
credit
to
fell
him
with
the
club
of
public
disfavor
wardrop
had
told
her
that
her
husband
letters
were
with
other
papers
at
the
monmouth
avenue
house
where
he
could
not
get
them
fleming
body
was
taken
home
that
day
saturday
but
she
had
gone
too
far
to
stop
she
wanted
the
papers
before
lightfoot
could
get
at
them
and
destroy
the
incriminating
ones
that
night
she
got
into
the
fleming
house
using
the
key
she
had
taken
she
ransacked
the
library
finding
not
the
letters
that
wardrop
had
said
were
there
but
others
equally
or
more
incriminating
canceled
notes
private
accounts
that
would
have
ruined
schwartz
for
ever
it
was
then
that
i
saw
the
light
and
went
my
unlucky
stumble
gave
her
warning
enough
to
turn
out
the
light
for
the
rest
the
chase
through
the
back
hall
the
and
the
pantry
had
culminated
in
her
escape
up
the
back
stairs
while
i
had
fallen
down
the
shaft
she
had
run
into
bella
on
the
upper
floor
bella
who
had
almost
fainted
and
who
knew
her
and
kept
her
until
morning
petting
her
and
soothing
her
and
finally
getting
her
into
a
troubled
sleep
that
day
she
realized
that
she
was
being
followed
when
invitation
came
she
accepted
it
at
once
for
the
sake
of
losing
herself
and
her
papers
until
she
was
ready
to
use
them
it
had
disconcerted
her
to
find
margery
there
but
she
managed
to
get
along
for
several
days
everything
had
gone
well
she
was
getting
stronger
again
ready
for
the
second
act
of
the
play
prepared
to
blackmail
schwartz
and
then
expose
him
she
would
have
killed
him
later
probably
she
wanted
her
measure
full
and
running
over
and
so
she
would
disgrace
him
first
then
schwartz
must
have
learned
of
the
loss
of
the
papers
from
the
fleming
house
and
guessed
the
rest
she
felt
sure
he
had
known
from
the
first
who
had
killed
fleming
however
that
might
be
he
had
had
her
room
entered
margery
chloroformed
in
the
connecting
room
and
her
papers
were
taken
from
under
her
pillow
while
she
was
pretending
anesthesia
she
had
followed
the
two
men
through
the
house
and
out
the
kitchen
door
where
she
had
fainted
on
the
grass
the
next
night
when
she
had
retired
early
leaving
margery
and
me
it
had
been
an
excuse
to
slip
out
of
the
house
how
she
found
that
schwartz
was
at
the
white
cat
how
she
got
through
the
side
entrance
we
never
knew
he
had
burned
the
papers
before
she
got
there
and
when
she
tried
to
kill
him
he
had
struck
her
hand
aside
when
we
were
out
in
the
cheerful
light
of
day
again
burton
turned
his
shrewd
blue
eyes
on
me
awful
story
is
it
he
said
those
are
primitive
emotions
if
you
like
do
you
know
knox
there
is
only
one
explanation
we
have
worked
on
for
the
rest
of
this
mystery
i
believe
in
my
soul
you
carried
off
the
old
lady
and
the
russia
leather
bag
yourself
chapter
xxvi
lovers
and
a
letter
at
noon
that
day
i
telephoned
to
margery
come
up
i
said
and
bring
the
keys
to
the
monmouth
avenue
house
i
have
some
things
to
tell
you
and
some
things
to
ask
you
i
met
her
at
the
station
with
lady
gray
and
the
trap
my
plans
for
that
afternoon
were
comprehensive
they
included
what
i
hoped
to
be
the
solution
of
the
aunt
jane
mystery
also
they
included
a
little
drive
through
the
park
and
a
well
i
shall
tell
about
that
all
i
am
going
to
tell
at
the
proper
time
to
play
propriety
edith
met
us
at
the
house
it
was
still
closed
and
even
in
the
short
time
that
had
elapsed
it
smelled
close
and
musty
at
the
door
into
the
i
stopped
them
now
this
is
going
to
be
a
sort
of
game
i
explained
it
a
sort
of
button
button
who
got
the
button
without
the
button
we
are
looking
for
a
drawer
receptacle
or
closet
which
shall
contain
bunched
together
and
without
regard
to
whether
they
should
be
there
or
not
a
small
revolver
two
military
brushes
and
a
clothes
brush
two
or
three
soft
bosomed
shirts
perhaps
a
collars
and
a
suit
of
underwear
also
a
small
flat
package
about
eight
inches
long
and
three
wide
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
edith
asked
i
am
not
talking
i
am
theorizing
i
explained
i
have
a
theory
and
according
to
it
the
things
should
be
here
if
they
are
not
it
is
my
misfortune
not
my
fault
i
think
margery
caught
my
idea
at
once
and
as
edith
was
ready
for
anything
we
commenced
the
search
edith
took
the
top
floor
being
accustomed
she
said
to
finding
unexpected
things
in
the
quarters
margery
took
the
lower
floor
and
for
certain
reasons
i
took
the
second
for
ten
minutes
there
was
no
result
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
had
finished
two
rooms
and
commenced
on
the
blue
boudoir
and
here
on
the
top
shelf
of
a
empire
cupboard
with
glass
doors
and
spindle
legs
i
found
what
i
was
looking
for
every
article
was
there
i
stuffed
a
small
package
into
my
pocket
and
called
the
two
girls
the
lost
is
found
i
stated
calmly
when
we
were
all
together
in
the
library
when
did
you
lose
anything
edith
demanded
do
you
mean
to
say
jack
knox
that
you
brought
us
here
to
help
you
find
a
suit
of
gaudy
pajamas
and
a
pair
of
military
brushes
i
brought
you
here
to
find
aunt
jane
i
said
soberly
taking
a
letter
and
the
flat
package
out
of
my
pocket
you
see
my
theory
worked
out
is
aunt
jane
and
is
the
money
from
the
russia
leather
bag
i
laid
the
packet
in
margery
lap
and
without
ceremony
opened
the
letter
it
began
my
dearest
niece
i
am
writing
to
you
because
i
can
not
think
what
to
say
to
sister
letitia
i
am
running
away
i
am
running
away
my
dear
it
scares
me
even
to
write
it
all
alone
in
this
empty
house
i
have
had
a
cup
of
tea
out
of
one
of
your
lovely
cups
and
a
nap
on
your
pretty
couch
and
just
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
i
am
going
to
take
the
train
for
boston
when
you
get
this
i
will
be
on
the
ocean
the
ocean
my
dear
that
i
have
read
about
and
dreamed
about
and
never
seen
i
am
going
to
realize
a
dream
of
forty
years
more
than
twice
as
long
as
you
have
lived
your
dear
mother
saw
the
continent
before
she
died
but
the
things
i
have
wanted
have
always
been
denied
me
i
have
been
of
those
that
have
eyes
to
see
and
see
not
so
i
have
run
away
i
am
going
to
london
and
paris
and
even
to
italy
if
the
money
your
father
gave
me
for
the
pearls
will
hold
out
for
a
year
now
i
have
been
getting
steamship
circulars
and
i
have
taken
a
little
french
through
a
correspondence
school
that
was
why
i
always
made
you
sing
french
songs
dearie
i
wanted
to
learn
the
accent
i
think
i
should
do
very
well
if
i
could
only
sing
my
french
instead
of
speaking
it
i
am
afraid
that
sister
letitia
discovered
that
i
had
taken
some
of
the
pearls
but
half
of
them
were
mine
from
our
mother
and
although
i
had
wanted
a
pearl
ring
all
my
life
i
have
never
had
one
i
am
going
to
buy
me
a
hat
instead
of
a
bonnet
and
clothes
and
pretty
things
underneath
and
a
switch
margery
i
have
wanted
a
switch
for
thirty
years
i
suppose
letitia
will
never
want
me
back
perhaps
i
shall
not
want
to
come
i
tried
to
write
to
her
when
i
was
leaving
but
i
had
cut
my
hand
in
the
attic
where
i
had
hidden
away
my
clothes
and
it
bled
on
the
paper
i
have
been
worried
since
for
fear
your
aunt
letitia
would
find
the
paper
in
the
basket
and
be
alarmed
at
the
stains
i
wanted
to
leave
things
in
order
please
tell
letitia
but
i
was
so
nervous
and
in
such
a
hurry
i
walked
three
miles
to
wynton
and
took
a
i
just
made
up
my
mind
i
was
going
to
do
it
i
am
and
it
is
time
i
have
a
chance
to
do
the
things
i
like
i
came
in
on
the
car
and
came
directly
here
i
got
in
with
the
second
key
on
your
did
you
miss
it
and
i
did
the
strangest
thing
at
bellwood
i
got
down
the
stairs
very
quietly
and
out
on
to
the
porch
i
set
down
my
empty
traveling
bag
i
was
going
to
buy
everything
new
in
the
city
to
close
the
door
behind
me
then
i
was
sure
i
heard
some
one
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
i
picked
it
up
and
ran
down
the
path
in
the
dark
you
can
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
opened
the
bag
this
morning
to
find
i
had
picked
up
harry
i
am
emptying
it
and
taking
it
with
me
for
he
has
mine
if
you
find
this
right
away
please
do
tell
sister
letitia
for
a
day
or
two
you
know
how
firm
your
aunt
letitia
is
i
shall
send
her
a
present
from
boston
to
pacify
her
and
perhaps
when
i
come
back
in
three
or
four
months
she
will
be
over
the
worst
i
am
not
quite
comfortable
about
your
father
margery
he
is
not
like
himself
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
gave
me
a
little
piece
of
paper
with
a
number
on
it
and
he
said
they
followed
him
everywhere
and
were
driving
him
crazy
try
to
have

uncontrolled
mirth
the
dear
little
old
lady
with
her
new
independence
and
her
romantic
starved
heart
then
we
