preface
this
book
is
my
recollections
of
forty
busy
years
few
men
in
civil
life
have
had
a
career
more
crowded
with
incident
enterprise
and
various
intercourse
with
the
world
than
mine
with
the
alternations
of
success
and
defeat
extensive
travel
in
this
and
foreign
lands
a
large
acquaintance
with
the
humble
and
honored
having
held
the
preÃ«minent
place
among
all
who
have
sought
to
furnish
healthful
entertainment
to
the
american
people
and
therefore
having
had
opportunities
for
garnering
an
ample
storehouse
of
incident
and
anecdote
while
at
the
same
time
needing
a
sagacity
energy
foresight
and
fortitude
rarely
required
or
exhibited
in
financial
affairs
my
struggles
and
experiences
it
is
not
altogether
vanity
in
me
to
think
can
not
be
without
interest
to
my
fellow
countrymen
various
leading
publishers
have
solicited
me
to
place
at
their
disposal
my
recollections
of
what
i
have
been
and
seen
and
done
these
proposals
together
with
the
partiality
of
friends
and
kindred
have
constrained
me
now
that
i
have
retired
from
all
active
participation
in
business
to
put
in
a
permanent
form
what
it
seems
to
me
may
be
instructive
entertaining
and
profitable
fifteen
years
since
for
the
purpose
principally
of
advancing
my
interests
as
proprietor
of
the
american
museum
i
gave
to
the
press
some
personal
reminiscences
and
sketches
having
an
extensive
sale
they
were
however
very
hastily
and
therefore
imperfectly
prepared
these
are
not
only
out
of
print
but
the
plates
have
been
destroyed
though
including
necessarily
in
common
with
them
some
of
the
facts
of
my
early
life
in
order
to
make
this
autobiography
a
complete
and
continuous
narrative
yet
as
the
latter
part
of
my
life
has
been
the
more
eventful
and
my
recollections
so
various
and
abundant
this
book
is
new
and
independent
of
the
former
it
is
the
matured
and
leisurely
review
of
almost
half
a
century
of
work
and
struggle
and
final
success
in
spite
of
fraud
and
fire
the
story
of
which
is
blended
with
amusing
anecdotes
funny
passages
felicitous
jokes
captivating
narratives
novel
experiences
and
remarkable
interviews
the
sunny
and
sombre
so
intermingled
as
not
only
to
entertain
but
convey
useful
lessons
to
all
classes
of
readers
these
recollections
are
dedicated
to
those
who
are
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
with
the
feeling
that
they
are
a
record
which
i
am
willing
to
leave
in
their
hands
as
a
legacy
which
they
will
value
and
above
and
beyond
this
personal
satisfaction
i
have
thought
that
the
review
of
a
life
with
the
wide
contrasts
of
humble
origin
and
high
and
honorable
success
of
most
formidable
obstacles
overcome
by
courage
and
constancy
of
affluence
that
had
been
patiently
won
suddenly
wrenched
away
and
triumphantly
regained
would
be
a
help
and
incentive
to
the
young
man
struggling
it
may
be
with
adverse
fortune
or
at
the
start
looking
into
the
future
with
doubt
or
despair
all
autobiographies
are
necessarily
egotistical
if
my
pages
are
as
plentifully
sprinkled
with
i
s
as
was
the
chief
ornament
of
hood
s
peacock
who
thought
he
had
the
eyes
of
europe
on
his
tail
i
can
only
say
that
the
i
s
are
essential
to
the
story
i
have
told
it
has
been
my
purpose
to
narrate
not
the
life
of
another
but
that
career
in
which
i
was
the
principal
actor
there
is
an
almost
universal
and
not
unworthy
curiosity
to
learn
the
methods
and
measures
the
ups
and
downs
the
strifes
and
victories
the
mental
and
moral
of
those
who
have
taken
an
active
and
prominent
part
in
human
affairs
but
an
autobiography
has
attractions
and
merits
superior
to
those
of
a
life
written
by
another
who
however
intimate
with
its
subject
can
not
know
all
that
helps
to
give
interest
and
accuracy
to
the
narrative
or
completeness
to
the
character
the
story
from
the
actor
s
own
lips
has
always
a
charm
it
can
never
have
when
told
by
another
that
my
narrative
is
interspersed
with
amusing
incidents
and
even
the
recital
of
some
very
practical
jokes
is
simply
because
my
natural
disposition
impels
me
to
look
upon
the
brighter
side
of
life
and
i
hope
my
humorous
experiences
will
entertain
my
readers
as
much
as
they
were
enjoyed
by
myself
and
if
this
record
of
trials
and
triumphs
struggles
and
successes
shall
stimulate
any
to
the
exercise
of
that
energy
industry
and
courage
in
their
callings
which
will
surely
lead
to
happiness
and
prosperity
one
main
object
i
have
in
yielding
to
the
solicitations
of
my
friends
and
my
publishers
will
have
been

my
name
phineas
taylor
is
derived
from
my
maternal
grandfather
who
was
a
great
wag
in
his
way
and
who
as
i
was
his
first
grandchild
gravely
handed
over
to
my
mother
at
my
christening
a
in
my
behalf
of
five
acres
of
land
situated
in
that
part
of
the
parish
of
bethel
known
as
the
plum
i
was
thus
a
real
estate
owner
almost
at
my
very
birth
and
of
my
property
ivy
island
something
shall
be
said
anon
my
father
philo
barnum
was
the
son
of
ephraim
barnum
of
bethel
who
was
a
captain
in
the
revolutionary
war
my
father
was
a
tailor
a
farmer
and
sometimes
a
and
my
advantages
and
disadvantages
were
such
as
fall
to
the
general
run
of
farmers
boys
i
drove
cows
to
and
from
the
pasture
shelled
corn
weeded
the
garden
as
i
grew
larger
i
rode
horse
for
ploughing
turned
and
raked
hay
in
due
time
i
handled
the
shovel
and
the
hoe
and
when
i
could
do
so
i
went
to
school
i
was
six
years
old
when
i
began
to
go
to
school
and
the
first
date
i
remember
inscribing
upon
my
was
the
ferule
in
those
days
was
the
assistant
but
in
spite
of
it
i
was
a
willing
and
i
think
a
pretty
apt
scholar
at
least
i
was
so
considered
by
my
teachers
and
schoolmates
and
as
the
years
went
on
there
were
never
more
than
two
or
three
in
the
school
who
were
deemed
my
superiors
in
arithmetic
i
was
unusually
ready
and
accurate
and
i
remember
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
being
called
out
of
bed
one
night
by
my
teacher
who
had
wagered
with
a
neighbor
that
i
could
calculate
the
correct
number
of
feet
in
a
load
of
wood
in
five
minutes
the
dimensions
given
i
figured
out
the
result
in
less
than
two
minutes
to
the
great
delight
of
my
teacher
and
to
the
equal
astonishment
of
his
neighbor
my
organ
of
acquisitiveness
was
manifest
at
an
early
age
before
i
was
five
years
of
age
i
began
to
accumulate
pennies
and
and
when
i
was
six
years
old
my
capital
amounted
to
a
sum
sufficient
to
exchange
for
a
silver
dollar
the
possession
of
which
made
me
feel
far
richer
and
more
independent
than
i
have
ever
since
felt
in
the
world
nor
did
my
dollar
long
remain
alone
as
i
grew
older
i
earned
ten
cents
a
day
for
riding
the
horse
which
led
the
ox
team
in
ploughing
and
on
holidays
and
training
days
instead
of
spending
money
i
earned
it
i
was
a
small
peddler
of
molasses
candy
of
home
make
cookies
and
cherry
rum
and
i
generally
found
myself
a
dollar
or
two
richer
at
the
end
of
a
holiday
than
i
was
at
the
beginning
i
was
always
ready
for
a
trade
and
by
the
time
i
was
twelve
years
old
besides
other
property
i
was
the
owner
of
a
sheep
and
a
calf
and
should
soon
no
doubt
have
become
a
small
crÅsus
had
not
my
father
kindly
permitted
me
to
purchase
my
own
clothing
which
somewhat
reduced
my
little
store
when
i
was
nearly
twelve
years
old
i
made
my
first
visit
to
the
metropolis
it
happened
in
this
wise
late
one
afternoon
in
january
daniel
brown
of
southbury
connecticut
arrived
at
my
father
s
tavern
in
bethel
with
some
fat
cattle
he
was
driving
to
new
york
to
sell
the
cattle
were
put
into
our
large
barnyard
the
horses
were
stabled
and
brown
and
his
assistant
were
provided
with
a
warm
supper
and
lodging
for
the
night
after
supper
i
heard
brown
say
to
my
father
that
he
intended
to
buy
more
cattle
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
hire
a
boy
to
assist
in
driving
the
cattle
i
immediately
besought
my
father
to
secure
the
situation
for
me
and
he
did
so
my
mother
s
consent
was
also
gained
and
at
daylight
next
morning
after
a
slight
breakfast
i
started
on
foot
in
the
midst
of
a
heavy
snow
storm
to
help
drive
the
cattle
before
reaching
ridgefield
i
was
sent
on
horseback
after
a
stray
ox
and
in
galloping
the
horse
fell
and
my
ankle
was
sprained
i
suffered
severely
but
did
not
complain
lest
my
employer
should
send
me
back
but
he
considerately
permitted
me
to
ride
behind
him
on
his
horse
and
indeed
did
so
most
of
the
way
to
new
york
where
we
arrived
in
three
or
four
days
we
put
up
at
the
bull
s
head
tavern
where
we
were
to
stay
a
week
while
the
drover
was
disposing
of
his
cattle
and
we
were
then
to
return
home
in
a
sleigh
it
was
an
eventful
week
for
me
before
i
left
home
my
mother
had
given
me
a
dollar
which
i
supposed
would
supply
every
want
that
heart
could
wish
my
first
outlay
was
for
oranges
which
i
was
told
were
four
pence
apiece
and
as
in
connecticut
was
six
cents
i
offered
ten
cents
for
two
oranges
which
was
of
course
readily
taken
and
thus
instead
of
saving
two
cents
as
i
thought
i
actually
paid
two
cents
more
than
the
price
demanded
i
then
bought
two
more
oranges
reducing
my
capital
to
eighty
cents
cents
was
the
charge
for
a
small
gun
which
would
go
off
and
send
a
stick
some
little
distance
and
this
gun
i
bought
amusing
myself
with
this
toy
in
the
of
the
bull
s
head
the
arrow
happened
to
hit
the
barkeeper
who
forthwith
came
from
behind
the
counter
and
shook
me
and
soundly
boxed
my
ears
telling
me
to
put
that
gun
out
of
the
way
or
he
would
put
it
into
the
fire
i
sneaked
to
my
room
put
my
treasure
under
the
pillow
and
went
out
for
another
visit
to
the
toy
shop
there
i
invested
six
cents
in
torpedoes
with
which
i
intended
to
astonish
my
schoolmates
in
bethel
i
could
not
refrain
however
from
experimenting
upon
the
guests
of
the
hotel
which
i
did
when
they
were
going
in
to
dinner
i
threw
two
of
the
torpedoes
against
the
wall
of
the
hall
through
which
the
guests
were
passing
and
the
immediate
results
were
as
follows
two
loud
reports
astonished
guests
irate
landlord
discovery
of
the
culprit
and
summary
punishment
for
the
landlord
immediately
floored
me
with
a
single
blow
with
his
open
hand
and
said
there
you
little
greenhorn
see
if
that
will
teach
you
better
than
to
explode
your
infernal
fire
crackers
in
my
house
the
lesson
was
sufficient
if
not
entirely
satisfactory
i
deposited
the
balance
of
the
torpedoes
with
my
gun
and
as
a
solace
for
my
wounded
feelings
i
again
visited
the
toy
shop
where
i
bought
a
watch
breastpin
and
top
leaving
but
eleven
cents
of
my
original
dollar
the
following
morning
found
me
again
at
the
fascinating
toy
shop
where
i
saw
a
beautiful
knife
with
two
blades
a
gimlet
and
a
corkscrew
a
whole
carpenter
shop
in
miniature
and
all
for
cents
but
alas
i
had
only
eleven
cents
have
that
knife
i
must
however
and
so
i
proposed
to
the
shop
woman
to
take
back
the
top
and
breastpin
at
a
slight
deduction
and
with
my
eleven
cents
to
let
me
have
the
knife
the
kind
creature
consented
and
this
makes
memorable
my
first
some
fine
and
nearly
white
molasses
candy
then
caught
my
eye
and
i
proposed
to
trade
the
watch
for
its
equivalent
in
candy
the
transaction
was
made
and
the
candy
was
so
delicious
that
before
night
my
gun
was
absorbed
in
the
same
way
the
next
morning
the
torpedoes
went
off
in
the
same
direction
and
before
night
even
my
beloved
knife
was
similarly
exchanged
my
money
and
my
goods
all
gone
i
traded
two
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
an
extra
pair
of
stockings
i
was
sure
i
should
not
want
for
nine
more
rolls
of
molasses
candy
and
then
wandered
about
the
city
disconsolate
sighing
because
there
was
no
more
molasses
candy
to
conquer
i
doubt
not
that
in
these
first
wanderings
about
the
city
i
often
passed
the
corner
of
broadway
and
ann
street
never
dreaming
of
the
stir
i
was
destined
at
a
future
day
to
make
in
that
locality
as
proprietor
and
manager
of
the
american
museum
after
wandering
gazing
and
wondering
for
a
week
brown
took
me
in
his
sleigh
and
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
we
arrived
in
bethel
i
had
a
thousand
questions
to
answer
and
then
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
i
was
quite
a
lion
among
my
mates
because
i
had
seen
the
great
metropolis
my
brothers
and
sisters
however
were
much
disappointed
at
my
not
bringing
them
something
from
my
dollar
and
when
my
mother
examined
my
wardrobe
and
found
two
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
one
pair
of
stockings
missing
she
whipped
me
and
sent
me
to
bed
thus
ingloriously
terminated
my
first
visit
to
new
york
previous
to
my
visit
to
new
york
i
think
it
was
in
when
i
was
ten
years
of
age
i
made
my
first
expedition
to
my
landed
property
ivy
this
it
will
be
remembered
was
the
gift
of
my
grandfather
from
whom
i
derived
my
name
from
the
time
when
i
was
four
years
old
i
was
continually
hearing
of
this
my
grandfather
always
spoke
of
me
in
my
presence
to
the
neighbors
and
to
strangers
as
the
richest
child
in
town
since
i
owned
the
whole
of
ivy
island
one
of
the
most
valuable
farms
in
the
state
my
father
and
mother
frequently
reminded
me
of
my
wealth
and
hoped
i
would
do
something
for
the
family
when
i
attained
my
majority
the
neighbors
professed
to
fear
that
i
might
refuse
to
play
with
their
children
because
i
had
inherited
so
large
a
property
these
constant
allusions
for
several
years
to
ivy
island
excited
at
once
my
pride
and
my
curiosity
and
stimulated
me
to
implore
my
father
s
permission
to
visit
my
property
at
last
he
promised
i
should
do
so
in
a
few
days
as
we
should
be
getting
some
hay
near
ivy
the
wished
for
day
at
length
arrived
and
my
father
told
me
that
as
we
were
to
mow
an
adjoining
meadow
i
might
visit
my
property
in
company
with
the
hired
man
during
the
my
grandfather
reminded
me
that
it
was
to
his
bounty
i
was
indebted
for
this
wealth
and
that
had
not
my
name
been
phineas
i
might
never
have
been
proprietor
of
ivy
to
this
my
mother
added
now
taylor
don
t
become
so
excited
when
you
see
your
property
as
to
let
your
joy
make
you
sick
for
remember
rich
as
you
are
that
it
will
be
eleven
years
before
you
can
come
into
possession
of
your
she
added
much
more
good
advice
to
all
of
which
i
promised
to
be
calm
and
reasonable
and
not
to
allow
my
pride
to
prevent
me
from
speaking
to
my
brothers
and
sisters
when
i
returned
home
when
we
arrived
at
the
meadow
which
was
in
that
part
of
the
plum
trees
known
as
east
swamp
i
asked
my
father
where
ivy
island
was
yonder
at
the
north
end
of
this
meadow
where
you
see
those
beautiful
trees
rising
in
the
all
the
forenoon
i
turned
grass
as
fast
as
two
men
could
cut
it
and
after
a
hasty
repast
at
noon
one
of
our
hired
men
a
good
natured
irishman
named
edmund
took
an
axe
on
his
shoulder
and
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
accompany
me
to
ivy
we
started
and
as
we
approached
the
north
end
of
the
meadow
we
found
the
ground
swampy
and
wet
and
were
soon
obliged
to
leap
from
bog
to
bog
on
our
route
a
misstep
brought
me
up
to
my
middle
in
water
to
add
to
the
dilemma
a
swarm
of
hornets
attacked
me
attaining
the
altitude
of
another
bog
i
was
cheered
by
the
assurance
that
there
was
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
this
kind
of
travel
to
the
edge
of
my
property
i
waded
on
in
about
fifteen
minutes
more
after
floundering
through
the
morass
i
found
myself
and
out
of
breath
on
comparatively
dry
land
never
mind
my
boy
said
edmund
we
have
only
to
cross
this
little
creek
and
ye
ll
be
upon
your
own
valuable
we
were
on
the
margin
of
a
stream
the
banks
of
which
were
thickly
covered
with
alders
i
now
discovered
the
use
of
edmund
s
axe
for
he
felled
a
small
oak
to
form
a
temporary
bridge
to
my
island
property
crossing
over
i
proceeded
to
the
centre
of
my
domain
i
saw
nothing
but
a
few
stunted
ivies
and
straggling
trees
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
i
had
been
the
of
the
family
and
neighborhood
for
years
my
valuable
ivy
island
was
an
almost
inaccessible
worthless
bit
of
barren
land
and
while
i
stood
deploring
my
sudden
downfall
a
huge
black
snake
one
of
my
tenants
approached
me
with
upraised
head
i
gave
one
shriek
and
rushed
for
the
bridge
this
was
my
first
and
i
need
not
say
my
last
visit
to
ivy
my
father
asked
me
how
i
liked
my
property
and
i
responded
that
i
would
sell
it
pretty
cheap
my
grandfather
congratulated
me
upon
my
visit
to
my
property
as
seriously
as
if
it
had
been
indeed
a
valuable
domain
my
mother
hoped
its
richness
had
fully
equalled
my
anticipations
the
neighbors
desired
to
know
if
i
was
not
now
glad
i
was
named
phineas
and
for
five
years
forward
i
was
frequently
reminded
of
my
wealth
in
ivy
as
i
grew
older
my
settled
aversion
to
manual
labor
farm
or
other
kind
was
manifest
in
various
ways
which
were
set
down
to
the
general
score
of
laziness
in
despair
of
doing
better
with
me
my
father
concluded
to
illustration
property
and
my
make
a
merchant
of
me
he
erected
a
building
in
bethel
and
with
hiram
weed
as
a
partner
purchased
a
stock
of
dry
goods
hardware
groceries
and
general
notions
and
installed
me
as
clerk
in
this
country
store
of
course
i
felt
my
it
was
condescension
on
my
part
to
talk
with
boys
who
did
work
i
stood
behind
the
counter
with
a
pen
over
my
ear
was
polite
to
the
ladies
and
was
wonderfully
active
in
waiting
upon
customers
we
kept
a
cash
credit
and
barter
store
and
i
drove
some
sharp
bargains
with
women
who
brought
butter
eggs
beeswax
and
feathers
to
exchange
for
dry
goods
and
with
men
who
wanted
to
trade
oats
corn
buckwheat
hats
and
other
commodities
for
tenpenny
nails
molasses
or
new
england
rum
but
it
was
a
drawback
upon
my
dignity
that
i
was
obliged
to
take
down
the
shutters
sweep
the
store
and
make
the
fire
i
received
a
small
salary
for
my
services
and
the
perquisite
of
what
profit
i
could
derive
from
purchasing
candies
on
my
own
account
to
sell
to
our
younger
customers
and
as
usual
my
father
stipulated
that
i
should
clothe
myself
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
learned
in
a
country
store
and
principally
this
that
sharp
trades
tricks
dishonesty
and
deception
are
by
no
means
confined
to
the
city
more
than
once
in
cutting
open
bundles
of
rags
brought
to
be
exchanged
for
goods
and
warranted
to
be
all
linen
and
cotton
i
have
discovered
in
the
interior
worthless
woolen
trash
and
sometimes
stones
gravel
or
ashes
sometimes
too
when
measuring
loads
of
oats
corn
or
rye
declared
to
contain
a
specified
number
of
bushels
say
sixty
i
have
found
them
four
or
five
bushels
short
in
such
cases
some
one
else
was
always
to
blame
but
these
happenings
were
frequent
enough
to
make
us
watchful
of
our
customers
in
the
evenings
and
on
wet
days
trade
was
always
dull
and
at
such
times
the
and
wits
and
wags
of
the
village
used
to
assemble
in
our
store
and
from
them
i
derived
considerable
amusement
if
not
profit
after
the
store
was
closed
at
night
i
frequently
joined
some
of
the
village
boys
at
the
houses
of
their
parents
where
with
and
play
a
couple
of
hours
would
soon
pass
by
and
then
as
late
perhaps
as
eleven
o
clock
i
went
home
and
slyly
crept
up
stairs
so
as
not
to
awaken
my
brother
with
whom
i
slept
and
who
would
be
sure
to
report
my
late
hours
he
made
every
attempt
and
laid
all
sorts
of
plans
to
catch
me
on
my
return
but
as
sleep
always
overtook
him
i
managed
easily
to
elude
his
efforts
like
most
people
in
connecticut
in
those
days
i
was
brought
up
to
attend
church
regularly
on
sunday
and
long
before
i
could
read
i
was
a
prominent
scholar
in
the
sunday
school
my
good
mother
taught
me
my
lessons
in
the
new
testament
and
the
catechism
and
my
every
effort
was
directed
to
win
one
of
those
rewards
of
merit
which
promised
to
pay
the
bearer
one
mill
so
that
ten
of
these
prizes
amounted
to
one
cent
and
one
hundred
of
them
which
might
be
won
by
faithful
assiduity
every
sunday
for
two
years
would
buy
a
sunday
school
book
worth
ten
cents
such
were
the
magnificent
rewards
held
out
to
the
religious
ambition
of
youth
there
was
but
one
church
or
in
bethel
which
all
attended
sinking
all
differences
of
creed
in
the
presbyterian
faith
the
old
had
neither
steeple
nor
bell
and
was
a
plain
edifice
comfortable
enough
in
summer
but
my
teeth
chatter
even
now
when
i
think
of
the
dreary
cold
freezing
hours
we
passed
in
that
place
in
winter
a
stove
in
a
in
those
days
would
have
been
a
sacrilegious
innovation
the
sermons
were
from
an
hour
and
one
half
to
two
hours
long
and
through
these
the
congregation
would
sit
and
shiver
till
they
really
merited
the
title
the
profane
gave
them
of
blue
some
of
the
women
carried
a
consisting
of
a
small
square
tin
box
in
a
wooden
frame
the
sides
perforated
and
in
the
interior
there
was
a
small
square
iron
dish
which
contained
a
few
live
coals
covered
with
ashes
these
stoves
were
usually
replenished
just
before
meeting
time
at
some
neighbor
s
near
the
after
many
years
of
shivering
and
suffering
one
of
the
brethren
had
the
temerity
to
propose
that
the
church
should
be
warmed
with
a
stove
his
impious
proposition
was
voted
down
by
an
overwhelming
majority
another
year
came
around
and
in
november
the
stove
question
was
again
brought
up
the
excitement
was
immense
the
subject
was
discussed
in
the
village
stores
and
in
the
juvenile
debating
club
it
was
prayed
over
in
conference
and
finally
in
general
society
s
meeting
in
december
the
stove
was
carried
by
a
majority
of
one
and
was
introduced
into
the
on
the
first
sunday
thereafter
two
ancient
maiden
ladies
were
so
oppressed
by
the
dry
and
heated
atmosphere
occasioned
by
the
wicked
innovation
that
they
fainted
away
and
were
carried
out
into
the
cool
air
where
they
speedily
returned
to
consciousness
especially
when
they
were
informed
that
owing
to
the
lack
of
two
lengths
of
pipe
no
fire
had
yet
been
made
in
the
stove
the
next
sunday
was
a
bitter
cold
day
and
the
stove
filled
with
hickory
was
a
great
gratification
to
the
many
and
displeased
only
a
few
after
the
benediction
an
old
deacon
rose
and
requested
the
congregation
to
remain
and
called
upon
them
to
witness
that
he
had
from
the
first
raised
his
voice
against
the
introduction
of
a
stove
into
the
house
of
the
lord
but
the
majority
had
been
against
him
and
he
had
submitted
now
if
they
have
a
stove
he
insisted
upon
having
a
large
one
since
the
present
one
did
not
heat
the
whole
house
but
drove
the
cold
to
the
back
outside
pews
making
them
three
times
as
cold
as
they
were
before
in
the
course
of
the
week
this
deacon
was
made
to
comprehend
that
unless
on
unusually
severe
days
the
stove
was
sufficient
to
warm
the
house
and
at
any
rate
it
did
not
drive
all
the
cold
in
the
house
into
one
corner
during
the
rev
lowe
s
ministrations
at
bethel
he
formed
a
bible
class
of
which
i
was
a
member
we
used
to
draw
promiscuously
from
a
hat
a
text
of
scripture
and
write
a
composition
on
the
text
which
compositions
were
read
after
service
in
the
afternoon
to
such
of
the
congregation
as
remained
to
hear
the
exercises
of
the
class
once
i
remember
i
drew
the
text

but
one
thing
is
needful
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
what
is
the
one
thing
needful
my
answer
was
nearly
as
follows
this
question
what
is
the
one
thing
needful
is
capable
of
receiving
various
answers
depending
much
upon
the
persons
to
whom
it
is
addressed
the
merchant
might
answer
that
the
one
thing
needful
is
plenty
of
customers
who
buy
liberally
without
beating
down
and
pay
cash
for
all
their
the
farmer
might
reply
that
the
one
thing
needful
is
large
harvests
and
high
the
physician
might
answer
that
it
is
plenty
of
the
lawyer
might
be
of
opinion
that
it
is
an
unruly
community
always
engaged
in
bickerings
and
the
clergyman
might
reply
it
is
a
fat
salary
with
multitudes
of
sinners
seeking
salvation
and
paying
large
pew
the
bachelor
might
exclaim
it
is
a
pretty
wife
who
loves
her
husband
and
who
knows
how
to
sew
on
the
maiden
might
answer
it
is
a
good
husband
who
will
love
cherish
and
protect
me
while
life
shall
but
the
most
proper
answer
and
doubtless
that
which
applied
to
the
case
of
mary
would
be
the
one
thing
needful
is
to
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
follow
in
his
footsteps
love
god
and
obey
his
commandments
love
our
and
embrace
every
opportunity
of
administering
to
his
necessities
in
short
the
one
thing
needful
is
to
live
a
life
that
we
can
always
look
back
upon
with
satisfaction
and
be
enabled
ever
to
contemplate
its
termination
with
trust
in
him
who
has
so
kindly
vouchsafed
it
to
us
surrounding
us
with
innumerable
blessings
if
we
have
but
the
heart
and
wisdom
to
receive
them
in
a
proper
the
reading
of
a
portion
of
this
answer
occasioned
some
amusement
in
the
congregation
in
which
the
clergyman
himself
joined
and
the
name
of
taylor
barnum
was
whispered
in
connection
with
the
composition
but
at
the
close
of
the
reading
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
lowe
say
that
it
was
a
well
written
and
truthful
answer
to
the
question

is

thing

my

with

accident
in
stepping
on
the
point
of
a
rusty
nail
and
though
the
matter
was
at
first
considered
trivial
it

in

death
alarming
symptoms
soon
made
her
sensible
that
she
was
on
her
and
while
she
was
in
full
possession
of
her
faculties
the
day
before
she
died
she
sent
for
her
grandchildren
to
take
final
leave
of
them
i
shall
never
forget
the
sensations
i
experienced
when
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
besought
me
to
lead
a
religious
life
and
especially
to
remember
that
i
could
in
no
way
so
effectually
prove
my
love
to
god
as
by
loving
all
my
the
impressions
of
that
scene
have
ever
been
among
my
most
vivid
recollections
and
i
trust
they
have
proved
in
some
degree
salutary
a
more
exemplary
woman
or
a
more
sincere
christian
than
my
grandmother
i
have
never
known
my
father
for
his
time
and
locality
was
a
man
of
much
enterprise
he
could
and
actually
did
keep
a
hotel
he
had
a
livery
stable
and
ran
in
a
small
way
what
in
our
day
would
be
called
a
norwalk
express
and
he
also
kept
a
country
store
with
greater
opportunities
and
a
larger
field
for
his
efforts
and
energies
he
might
have
been
a
man
of
mark
and
means
not
that
he
was
successful
for
he
never
did
a
profitable
business
but
i
who
saw
him
in
his
various
pursuits
and
acted
as
his
clerk
caught
something
of
his
enterprising
spirit
and
perhaps
without
egotism
i
may
say
i
inherited
that
characteristic
my
business
education
was
as
good
as
the
limited
field
afforded
and
i
soon
put
it
to
account
and
service
on
the
of
september
my
father
who
had
been
sick
since
the
month
of
march
died
at
the
age
of
years
my
mother
was
left
with
five
children
of
whom
i
at
fifteen
years
of
age
was
the
eldest
while
the
youngest
was
but
seven
it
was
soon
apparent
that
my
father
had
provided
nothing
for
the
support
of
his
family
his
estate
was
insolvent
and
it
did
not
pay
fifty
cents
on
the
dollar
my
mother
by
economy
industry
and
perseverance
succeeded
in
a
few
years
afterwards
in
redeeming
the
homestead
and
becoming
its
sole
possessor
but
at
the
date
of
the
death
of
my
father
the
world
looked
gloomy
indeed
the
few
dollars
i
had
accumulated
and
loaned
to
my
father
holding
his
note
therefor
were
decided
to
be
the
property
of
a
minor
belonging
to
the
father
and
so
to
the
estate
and
my
small
claim
was
ruled
out
i
was
obliged
to
get
trusted
for
the
pair
of
shoes
i
wore
to
my
father
s
funeral
i
literally
began
the
world
with
nothing
and
was
barefooted
at
that
leaving
weed
i
went
to
grassy
plain
a
mile
northwest
of
bethel
and
secured
a
situation
as
clerk
in
the
store
of
james
keeler
lewis
whitlock
at
six
dollars
a
month
and
my
board
i
lived
with
jerusha
wheeler
and
her
daughters
jerusha
and
mary
and
found
an
excellent
home
i
chose
my
uncle
alanson
taylor
as
my
guardian
i
did
my
best
to
please
my
employers
and
soon
gained
their
confidence
and
esteem
and
was
regarded
by
them
as
an
active
clerk
and
a
cute
trader
they
afforded
me
many
facilities
for
making
money
on
my
own
account
and
i
soon
entered
upon
sundry
speculations
and
succeeded
in
getting
a
small
sum
of
money
ahead
i
made
a
very
remarkable
trade
at
one
time
for
my
employers
by
purchasing
in
their
absence
a
whole
wagon
load
of
green
glass
bottles
of
various
sizes
for
which
i
paid
in
unsalable
goods
at
very
profitable
prices
how
to
dispose
of
the
bottles
was
then
the
problem
and
as
it
was
also
desirable
to
get
rid
of
a
large
quantity
of
tin
ware
which
had
been
in
the
shop
for
years
and
was
considerably
i
conceived
the
idea
of
a
lottery
in
which
the
highest
prize
should
be
dollars
payable
in
any
goods
the
winner
desired
while
there
were
to
be
fifty
prizes
of
five
dollars
each
payable
in
goods
to
be
designated
in
the
scheme
then
there
were
one
hundred
prizes
of
one
dollar
each
one
hundred
prizes
of
fifty
cents
each
and
three
hundred
prizes
of
cents
each
it
is
unnecessary
to
state
that
the
minor
prizes
consisted
mainly
of
glass
and
tin
ware
the
tickets
sold
like
wildfire
and
the
worn
tin
and
glass
bottles
were
speedily
turned
into
cash
as
my
mother
continued
to
keep
the
village
tavern
at
bethel
i
usually
went
home
on
saturday
night
and
stayed
till
monday
morning
going
to
church
with
my
mother
on
sunday
this
habit
was
the
occasion
of
an
experience
of
momentous
consequence
to
me
one
saturday
evening
during
a
violent
thunder
shower
miss
mary
wheeler
a
milliner
sent
me
word
that
there
was
a
girl
from
bethel
at
her
house
who
had
come
up
on
horseback
to
get
a
new
bonnet
that
she
was
afraid
to
go
back
alone
and
if
i
was
going
to
bethel
that
evening
she
wished
me
to
escort
her
customer
i
assented
and
went
over
to
aunt
rushia
s
where
i
was
introduced
to
chairy
charity
hallett
a
fair
buxom
girl
with
beautiful
white
teeth
i
assisted
her
to
her
saddle
and
mounting
my
own
horse
we
trotted
towards
bethel
my
first
impressions
of
this
girl
as
i
saw
her
at
the
house
were
exceedingly
favorable
as
soon
as
we
started
i
began
a
conversation
with
her
and
finding
her
very
affable
i
regretted
that
the
distance
to
bethel
was
not
five
miles
instead
of
one
a
flash
of
lightning
gave
me
a
distinct
view
of
the
face
of
my
fair
companion
and
then
i
wished
the
distance
was
twenty
miles
during
our
ride
i
learned
that
she
was
a
tailoress
working
with
zerah
benedict
of
bethel
we
soon
arrived
at
our
destination
and
i
bid
her
good
night
and
went
home
the
next
day
i
saw
her
at
church
and
indeed
many
sundays
afterwards
but
i
had
no
opportunity
to
renew
the
acquaintance
that
season
jerusha
wheeler
with
whom
i
boarded
and
her
daughter
jerusha
were
familiarly
known
the
one
as
aunt
rushia
and
the
other
as
many
of
our
store
customers
were
hatters
and
among
the
many
kinds
of
furs
we
sold
for
the
nap
of
hats
was
one
known
to
the
trade
as
one
day
a
hatter
walter
dibble
called
to
buy
some
furs
i
sold
him
several
kinds
including
beaver
and
cony
and
he
then
asked
for
some
we
had
none
and
as
i
wanted
to
play
a
joke
upon
him
i
told
him
that
wheeler
had
several
hundred
pounds
of
what
on
earth
is
a
woman
doing
with
russia
said
he
i
could
not
answer
but
i
assured
him
that
there
were
one
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
of
old
rushia
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
young
rushia
in
wheeler
s
house
and
under
her
charge
but
whether
or
not
it
was
for
sale
i
could
not
say
off
he
started
to
make
the
purchase
and
knocked
at
the
door
wheeler
the
elder
made
her
appearance
i
want
to
get
your
russia
said
the
hatter
wheeler
asked
him
to
walk
in
and
be
seated
she
of
course
supposed
that
he
had
come
for
her
daughter
what
do
you
want
of
rushia
asked
the
old
lady
to
make
hats
was
the
reply
to
trim
hats
i
suppose
you
mean
responded
wheeler
no
for
the
outside
of
hats
replied
the
hatter
well
i
don
t
know
much
about
hats
said
the
old
lady
but
i
will
call
my
passing
into
another
room
where
rushia
the
younger
was
at
work
she
informed
her
that
a
man
wanted
her
to
make
hats
oh
he
means
sister
mary
probably
i
suppose
he
wants
some
ladies
hats
replied
rushia
as
she
went
into
the
parlor
this
is
my
daughter
said
the
old
lady
i
want
to
get
your
russia
said
he
addressing
the
young
lady
i
suppose
you
wish
to
see
my
sister
mary
she
is
our
milliner
said
young
rushia
i
wish
to
see
whoever
owns
the
property
said
the
hatter
sister
mary
was
sent
for
and
as
she
was
introduced
the
hatter
informed
her
that
he
wished
to
buy
her
buy
rushia
exclaimed
mary
in
surprise
i
don
t
understand
your
name
is
miss
wheeler
i
believe
said
the
hatter
who
was
annoyed
by
the
difficulty
he
met
with
in
being
understood
it
is
ah
very
well
is
there
old
and
young
russia
in
the
house
i
believe
there
is
said
mary
surprised
at
the
familiar
manner
in
which
he
spoke
of
her
mother
and
sister
who
were
present
what
is
the
price
of
old
russia
per
pound
asked
the
hatter
i
believe
sir
that
old
rushia
is
not
for
sale
replied
mary
indignantly
well
what
do
you
ask
for
young
russia
pursued
the
hatter
sir
said
miss
rushia
the
younger
springing
to
her
feet
do
you
come
here
to
insult
defenceless
females
if
you
do
sir
we
will
soon
call
our
brother
who
is
in
the
garden
and
he
will
punish
you
as
you
ladies
exclaimed
the
hatter
in
astonishment
what
on
earth
have
i
done
to
offend
you
i
came
here
on
a
business
matter
i
want
to
buy
some
russia
i
was
told
you
had
old
and
young
russia
in
the
house
indeed
this
young
lady
just
stated
such
to
be
the
fact
but
she
says
the
old
russia
is
not
for
sale
now
if
i
can
buy
the
young
russia
i
want
to
do
so
but
if
that
can
t
be
done
please
to
say
so
and
i
will
trouble
you
no
mother
open
the
door
and
let
this
man
go
out
he
is
undoubtedly
crazy
said
miss
mary
by
thunder
i
believe
i
shall
be
if
i
remain
here
long
exclaimed
the
hatter
considerably
excited
i
wonder
if
folks
never
do
business
in
these
parts
that
you
think
a
man
is
crazy
if
he
attempts
such
a
thing
business
poor
man
said
mary
soothingly
approaching
the
door
i
am
not
a
poor
man
madam
replied
the
hatter
my
name
is
walter
dibble
i
carry
on
hatting
extensively
in
danbury
i
came
to
grassy
plains
to
buy
fur
and
have
purchased
some
beaver
and
cony
and
now
it
seems
i
am
to
be
called
crazy
and
a
poor
man
because
i
want
to
buy
a
little
russia
to
make
up
my
the
ladies
began
to
open
their
eyes
they
saw
that
dibble
was
quite
in
earnest
and
his
explanation
threw
considerable
light
upon
the
subject
who
sent
you
here
asked
sister
mary
the
clerk
at
the
opposite
store
was
the
reply
he
is
a
wicked
young
fellow
for
making
all
this
trouble
said
the
old
lady
he
has
been
doing
this
for
a
a
joke
exclaimed
dibble
in
surprise
have
you
no
russia
then
my
name
is
jerusha
and
so
is
my
daughter
s
said
wheeler
and
that
i
suppose
is
what
he
meant
by
telling
you
about
old
and
young
dibble
bolted
through
the
door
without
another
word
and
made
directly
for
our
store
you
young
scamp
said
he
as
he
entered
what
did
you
mean
by
sending
me
over
there
to
buy
russia
i
did
not
send
you
to
rushia
i
supposed
you
were
either
a
bachelor
or
widower
and
wanted
to
rushia
i
replied
with
a
serious
countenance
you
lie
you
young
dog
and
you
know
it
but
never
mind
i
ll
pay
you
off
some
day
and
taking
his
furs
he
departed
with
less
than
could
have
been
expected
under
the
circumstances
among
our
customers
were
three
or
four
old
revolutionary
pensioners
who
traded
out
the
amounts
of
their
pensions
before
they
were
due
leaving
their
papers
as
security
one
of
these
pensioners
was
old
bevans
commonly
known
as
uncle
bibbins
a
man
who
loved
his
glass
and
was
very
prone
to
relate
romantic
revolutionary
anecdotes
and
adventures
in
which
he
of
course
was
conspicuous
at
one
time
he
was
in
our
debt
and
though
we
held
his
pension
papers
it
would
be
three
months
before
the
money
could
be
drawn
it
was
desirable
to
get
him
away
for
that
length
of
time
and
we
hinted
to
him
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
make
a
visit
to
guilford
where
he
had
relations
but
he
would
not
go
finally
i
hit
upon
a
plan
which
moved
him
a
journeyman
hatter
named
benton
who
was
fond
of
a
practical
joke
was
let
into
the
secret
and
was
persuaded
to
call
uncle
bibbins
a
coward
to
tell
him
that
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
back
and
thus
to
provoke
a
duel
which
he
did
and
at
my
suggestion
uncle
bibbins
challenged
benton
to
fight
him
with
musket
and
ball
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
the
challenge
was
accepted
i
was
chosen
second
by
uncle
bibbins
and
the
duel
was
to
come
off
immediately
my
principal
taking
me
aside
begged
me
to
put
nothing
in
the
guns
but
blank
cartridges
i
assured
him
it
should
be
so
and
therefore
that
he
might
feel
perfectly
safe
this
gave
the
old
man
extra
courage
he
declared
that
he
had
not
been
so
long
in
bloody
battles
for
nothing
and
that
he
would
put
a
bullet
through
benton
s
heart
at
the
first
shot
the
ground
was
measured
in
the
lot
at
the
rear
of
our
store
and
the
principals
and
seconds
took
their
places
at
the
word
given
both
parties
fired
uncle
bibbins
of
course
escaped
unhurt
but
benton
leaped
several
feet
into
the
air
and
fell
upon
the
ground
with
a
dreadful
yell
as
if
he
had
been
really
shot
uncle
bibbins
was
frightened
as
his
second
i
ran
to
him
told
him
i
had
neglected
to
extract
the
bullet
from
his
gun
which
was
literally
true
as
there
was
no
bullet
in
it
to
extract
and
he
supposed
of
course
he
had
killed
his
adversary
i
then
whispered
to
him
to
go
immediately
to
guilford
to
keep
quiet
and
he
should
hear
from
me
as
soon
as
it
would
be
safe
to
do
so
he
started
up
the
street
on
a
run
and
immediately
quit
the
town
for
guilford
where
he
kept
himself
quiet
until
it
was
time
for
him
to
return
and
sign
his
papers
i
then
wrote
him
that
he
could
return
in
safety
that
his
adversary
had
recovered
from
his
wound
and
now
forgave
him
all
as
he
felt
himself
much
to
blame
for
having
insulted
a
man
of
his
known
uncle
bibbins
returned
signed
the
papers
and
we
obtained
the
pension
money
a
few
days
thereafter
he
met
benton
my
brave
old
friend
said
benton
i
forgive
you
my
terrible
wound
and
long
confinement
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
also
i
insulted
you
without
a
i
forgive
you
freely
said
uncle
bibbins
but
he
added
you
must
be
careful
next
time
how
you
insult
a
dead
benton
promised
to
be
more
circumspect
in
future
and
uncle
bibbins
supposed
to
the
day
of
his
death
that
the
duel
wound
danger
and
all
were
matters
of
fact

where
he
kept
a
grocery
store
and
also
had
a
large
comb
factory
and
a
comb
store
in
new
york
in
the
fall
of
he
offered
me
a
situation
as
clerk
in
his
brooklyn
store
and
i
accepted
it
i
soon
became
conversant
with
the
routine
of
my
employer
s
business
and
before
long
he
entrusted
to
me
the
purchasing
of
all
goods
for
his
store
i
bought
for
cash
entirely
going
into
the
lower
part
of
new
york
city
in
search
of
the
cheapest
market
for
groceries
often
attending
auctions
of
teas
sugars
molasses
watching
the
sales
noting
prices
and
buyers
and
frequently
combining
with
other
grocers
to
bid
off
large
lots
which
we
subsequently
divided
giving
each
of
us
the
quantity
wanted
at
a
lower
rate
than
if
the
goods
had
passed
into
other
hands
compelling
us
to
pay
another
profit
situated
as
i
was
and
well
treated
as
i
was
by
my
employer
who
manifested
great
interest
in
me
still
i
was
dissatisfied
a
salary
was
not
sufficient
for
me
my
disposition
was
of
that
speculative
character
which
refused
to
be
satisfied
unless
i
was
engaged
in
some
business
where
my
profits
might
be
enhanced
or
at
least
made
to
depend
upon
my
energy
perseverance
attention
to
business
tact
and
accordingly
as
i
had
no
opportunity
to
speculate
on
my
own
account
i
became
uneasy
and
young
as
i
was
i
began
to
talk
of
setting
up
for
myself
for
although
i
had
no
capital
several
men
of
means
had
offered
to
furnish
the
money
and
join
me
in
business
i
was
in
that
uneasy
transitory
state
between
boyhood
and
manhood
when
i
had
unbounded
confidence
in
my
own
abilities
and
yet
needed
a
discreet
counsellor
adviser
and
friend
in
the
following
summer
i
was
taken
down
with
the
and
was
confined
to
the
house
for
several
months
this
sickness
made
a
sad
inroad
upon
my
means
when
i
was
sufficiently
recovered
i
started
for
home
to
recruit
taking
passage
on
board
a
sloop
for
norwalk
but
the
remaining
passengers
were
so
frightened
at
the
appearance
of
my
face
which
still
bore
the
marks
of
the
disease
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
ashore
again
which
i
did
stopping
at
holt
s
in
fulton
street
going
to
norwalk
by
steamboat
next
morning
and
arriving
at
bethel
in
the
afternoon
during
my
convalescence
at
my
mother
s
house
i
visited
my
old
friends
and
neighbors
and
had
the
opportunity
to
slightly
renew
my
acquaintance
with
the
attractive
tailoress
chairy
hallett
a
month
afterwards
i
returned
to
brooklyn
where
i
gave
taylor
notice
of
my
desire
to
leave
his
employment
and
i
then
opened
a
on
my
own
account
in
a
few
months
i
sold
out
to
good
advantage
and
accepted
a
favorable
offer
to
engage
as
clerk
in
a
similar
establishment
kept
by
david
thorp
peck
slip
new
york
it
was
a
great
resort
for
danbury
and
bethel
comb
makers
and
hatters
and
i
thus
had
frequent
opportunities
of
seeing
and
hearing
from
my
i
lived
in
thorp
s
family
and
was
kindly
treated
i
was
often
permitted
to
visit
the
theatre
with
friends
who
came
to
new
york
and
as
i
had
considerable
taste
for
the
drama
i
soon
became
in
my
own
opinion
a
discriminating
critic
nor
did
i
fail
to
exhibit
my
powers
to
my
connecticut
friends
who
accompanied
me
to
the
play
let
me
gratefully
add
that
my
habits
were
not
bad
though
i
sold
liquors
to
others
i
do
not
think
i
ever
drank
a
pint
of
liquor
wine
or
cordials
before
i
was
years
of
age
i
always
had
a
bible
which
i
frequently
read
and
i
attended
church
regularly
these
habits
so
far
as
they
go
are
in
the
right
direction
and
i
am
thankful
that
they
characterized
my
early
youth
however
worthy
or
unworthy
may
have
been
my
later
years
i
that
i
owe
much
of
the
better
part
of
my
nature
to
my
youthful
regard
for
sunday
and
its
institutions
a
regard
i
trust
still
strong
in
my
character
in
february
i
returned
to
bethel
and
opened
a
retail
fruit
and
confectionery
store
in
a
part
of
my
grandfather
s
which
was
situated
on
the
main
street
and
which
was
offered
to
me
rent
free
if
i
would
return
to
my
native
village
and
establish
some
sort
of
business
this
beginning
of
business
on
my
own
account
was
an
eventful
era
in
my
life
my
total
capital
was
one
hundred
and
twenty
dollars
fifty
of
which
i
had
expended
in
fitting
up
the
store
and
the
remaining
seventy
dollars
purchased
my
stock
in
trade
i
had
arranged
with
fruit
dealers
whom
i
knew
in
new
york
to
receive
my
orders
and
i
decided
to
open
my
establishment
on
the
first
monday
in
may
our
general
training
day
it
was
a
red
letter
day
for
me
the
village
was
crowded
with
people
from
the
surrounding
region
and
the
novelty
of
my
little
shop
attracted
attention
long
before
noon
i
was
obliged
to
call
in
one
of
my
old
schoolmates
to
assist
in
waiting
upon
my
numerous
customers
and
when
i
closed
at
night
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
reckoning
up
dollars
as
my
day
s
receipts
nor
although
i
had
received
the
entire
cost
of
my
goods
less
seven
dollars
did
the
stock
seem
seriously
diminished
showing
that
my
profits
had
been
large
i
need
not
say
how
much
gratified
i
was
with
the
result
of
this
first
day
s
experiment
the
store
was
a
fixed
fact
i
went
to
new
york
and
expended
all
my
money
in
a
stock
of
fancy
goods
such
as
combs
beads
rings
and
a
few
toys
these
with
fruit
nuts
made
the
business
good
through
the
summer
and
in
the
fall
i
added
stewed
oysters
to
the
inducements
my
grandfather
who
was
much
interested
in
my
success
advised
me
to
take
an
agency
for
the
sale
of
lottery
tickets
on
commission
in
those
days
the
lottery
was
not
deemed
objectionable
on
the
score
of
morality
very
worthy
people
invested
in
such
schemes
without
a
thought
of
evil
and
then
as
now
churches
even
got
up
lotteries
with
this
difference
that
then
they
were
called
lotteries
and
now
they
go
under
some
other
name
while
i
am
very
glad
that
an
improved
public
sentiment
denounces
the
lottery
in
general
as
an
illegitimate
means
of
getting
money
and
while
i
do
not
see
how
any
one
especially
in
or
near
a
new
england
state
can
engage
in
a
lottery
without
feeling
a
reproach
which
no
pecuniary
return
can
compensate
yet
i
can
not
now
accuse
myself
for
having
been
lured
into
a
business
which
was
then
sanctioned
by
good
christian
people
who
now
join
with
me
in
reprobating
enterprises
they
once
encouraged
but
as
public
sentiment
was
forty
years
ago
i
obtained
an
agency
to
sell
lottery
tickets
on
a
commission
of
ten
per
cent
and
this
business
in
connection
with
my
little
store
made
my
profits
quite
satisfactory
i
used
to
have
some
curious
customers
on
one
occasion
a
young
man
called
on
me
and
selected
a
which
pleased
him
asking
me
to
give
him
credit
for
a
few
weeks
i
told
him
that
if
he
wanted
any
article
of
necessity
in
my
line
i
should
not
object
to
trust
him
for
a
short
time
but
it
struck
me
that
a
was
a
decided
superfluity
for
a
man
who
had
no
money
i
therefore
declined
to
trust
him
as
i
did
not
see
the
necessity
for
his
possessing
such
an
article
till
he
had
something
to
put
into
it
later
in
life
i
have
been
credited
with
the
utterance
of
some
sagacious
remarks
but
this
with
regard
to
the
trivial
as
the
matter
is
in
itself
seems
to
me
quite
as
deserving
of
note
as
any
of
my
ideas
which
have
created
more
sensation
my
store
had
much
to
do
in
giving
shape
to
my
future
character
as
well
as
career
in
that
it
became
a
favorite
resort
the
theatre
of
village
talk
and
the
scene
of
many
practical
jokes
for
any
excess
of
the
jocose
element
in
my
character
part
of
the
blame
must
attach
to
my
early
surroundings
as
a
village
clerk
and
merchant
in
that
true
resort
of
village
wits
and
wags
the
country
store
fun
pure
and
simple
will
be
sure
to
find
the
surface
my
bethel
store
was
the
scene
of
many
most
amusing
incidents
in
some
of
which
i
was
an
immediate
participant
though
in
many
of
course
i
was
only
a
listener
or
spectator
the
following
scene
makes
a
chapter
in
the
history
of
connecticut
as
the
state
was
when
were
something
more
than
a
dead
letter
to
swear
in
those
days
was
according
to
custom
but
contrary
to
law
a
person
from
new
york
state
whom
i
will
call
crofut
who
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
my
store
was
a
man
of
property
and
equally
noted
for
his
and
his
really
terrible
profanity
one
day
he
was
in
my
little
establishment
engaged
in
conversation
when
nathan
seelye
one
of
our
village
justices
of
the
peace
and
a
man
of
strict
religious
principles
came
in
and
hearing
crofut
s
profane
language
he
told
him
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
fine
him
one
dollar
for
swearing
crofut
responded
immediately
with
an
oath
that
he
did
not
care
a
d
n
for
the
connecticut
that
will
make
two
dollars
said
seelye
this
brought
forth
another
oath
three
dollars
said
the
sturdy
justice
nothing
but
oaths
were
given
in
reply
until
esquire
seelye
declared
the
damage
to
the
connecticut
laws
to
amount
to
fifteen
dollars
crofut
took
out
a
bill
and
handed
it
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
with
an
oath
sixteen
dollars
said
seelye
counting
out
four
dollars
to
hand
to
crofut
as
his
change
oh
keep
it
keep
it
said
crofut
i
don
t
want
any
change
i
ll
d
d
soon
swear
out
the
he
did
so
after
which
he
was
more
circumspect
in
his
conversation
remarking
that
twenty
dollars
a
day
for
swearing
was
about
as
much
as
he
could
stand
on
another
occasion
a
man
arrested
for
assault
and
battery
was
to
be
tried
before
my
grandfather
who
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
a
young
medical
student
named
newton
volunteered
to
defend
the
prisoner
and
couch
the
came
to
me
and
said
that
as
the
prisoner
had
engaged
a
pettifogger
the
state
ought
to
have
some
one
to
represent
its
interests
and
he
would
give
me
a
dollar
to
present
the
case
i
accepted
the
fee
and
proposition
the
fame
of
the
eminent
counsel
on
both
sides
drew
quite
a
crowd
to
hear
the
case
as
for
the
case
itself
it
was
useless
to
argue
it
for
the
guilt
of
the
prisoner
was
established
by
evidence
of
half
a
dozen
witnesses
however
newton
was
bound
to
display
himself
and
so
rising
with
much
dignity
he
addressed
my
grandfather
with
may
it
please
the
honorable
court
proceeding
with
a
mixture
of
poetry
and
invective
against
couch
the
whom
he
assumed
to
be
the
vindictive
plaintiff
in
this
case
after
alluding
to
him
as
such
for
the
twentieth
time
my
grandfather
stopped
newton
in
the
midst
of
his
splendid
peroration
and
informed
him
that
couch
was
not
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
not
the
plaintiff
then
may
it
please
your
honor
i
should
like
to
know
who
is
the
plaintiff
inquired
newton
he
was
quietly
informed
that
the
state
of
connecticut
was
the
plaintiff
whereupon
newton
dropped
into
his
seat
as
if
he
had
been
shot
thereupon
i
rose
with
great
confidence
and
speaking
from
my
notes
proceeded
to
show
the
guilt
of
the
prisoner
from
the
evidence
that
there
was
no
discrepancy
in
the
testimony
that
none
of
the
witnesses
had
been
impeached
that
no
defence
had
been
offered
that
i
was
astonished
at
the
audacity
of
both
counsel
and
prisoner
in
not
pleading
guilty
at
once
and
then
soaring
aloft
on
general
principles
i
began
to
look
about
for
a
safe
place
to
alight
when
my
grandfather
interrupted
me
with
young
man
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
inform
the
court
which
side
you
are
pleading
for
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
it
was
my
turn
to
drop
which
i
did
amid
a
shout
of
laughter
from
every
corner
of
the
newton
who
had
been
very
downcast
looked
up
with
a
broad
grin
and
the
two
eminent
counsel
sneaked
out
of
the
room
in
company
while
the
prisoner
was
bound
over
to
the
next
county
court
for
trial
while
my
business
in
bethel
continued
to
increase
beyond
my
expectations
i
was
also
happy
in
believing
that
my
suit
with
the
fair
tailoress
charity
hallett
was
duly
progressing
of
all
the
young
people
with
whom
i
associated
in
our
parties
picnics
and
she
stood
highest
in
my
estimation
and
continued
to
improve
upon
acquaintance
how
i
managed
at
one
of
our
sleigh
rides
is
worth
narrating
my
grandfather
would
at
any
time
let
me
have
a
horse
and
sleigh
always
excepting
his
new
sleigh
the
finest
in
the
village
and
a
favorite
horse
called
i
especially
coveted
this
turnout
for
one
of
our
parties
knowing
that
i
could
eclipse
all
my
comrades
and
so
i
asked
grandfather
if
i
could
have
arabian
and
the
new
sleigh
yes
if
you
have
twenty
dollars
in
your
pocket
was
the
reply
i
immediately
showed
the
money
and
putting
it
back
in
my
pocket
said
with
a
laugh
you
see
i
have
the
money
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
suppose
i
can
have
arab
and
the
new
sleigh
of
course
he
meant
to
deny
me
by
making
what
he
thought
to
be
an
impossible
condition
to
wit
that
i
should
hire
the
team
at
a
good
round
price
if
i
had
it
at
all
but
i
had
caught
him
so
suddenly
that
he
was
compelled
to
consent
and
chairy
and
i
had
the
crack
team
of
the
party
there
was
a
young
apprentice
to
the
tailoring
trade
in
bethel
whom
i
will
call
john
mallett
whose
education
had
been
much
neglected
and
who
had
been
paying
his
addresses
to
a
certain
lucretia
for
some
six
months
with
a
strong
probability
of
being
jilted
at
last
on
a
sunday
evening
she
had
declined
to
take
his
arm
accepting
instead
the
arm
of
the
next
man
who
offered
and
mallett
determined
to
demand
an
explanation
he
accordingly
came
to
me
the
saturday
evening
following
asking
me
when
i
had
closed
my
store
to
write
a
strong
and
remonstratory
for
him
i
asked
bill
shepard
who
was
present
to
remain
and
assist
and
in
due
time
the
joint
efforts
of
shepard
mallett
and
myself
resulted
in
the
following
production
i
give
the
letter
as
an
illustrative
chapter
in
real
life
in
novels
such
correspondence
is
usually
presented
in
elaborate
rhetoric
with
studied
elegance
of
phrase
but
the
true
language
of
the
heart
is
always
nearly
the
same
in
all
time
and
in
all
tongues
and
when
the
blood
is
up
the
writer
is
far
more
intent
upon
the
matter
than
the
manner
and
aims
to
be
forcible
rather
than
elegant
the
subjoined
letter
is
certainly
not
after
the
manner
of
chesterfield
but
it
is
such
a
letter
as
a
disappointed
lover
spurred
by
the
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
frequently
indites
with
a
demand
from
mallett
that
we
should
begin
in
strong
terms
and
shepard
acting
as
scribe
we
concocted
the
following
bethel
miss
lucretia
i
write
this
to
ask
an
explanation
of
your
conduct
in
giving
me
the
mitten
on
sunday
night
last
if
you
think
madam
that
you
can
trifle
with
my
affections
and
turn
me
off
for
every
little
that
you
can
pick
up
you
will
find
yourself
considerably
mistaken
we
read
thus
far
to
mallett
and
it
met
his
approval
he
said
he
liked
the
idea
of
calling
her
madam
for
he
thought
it
sounded
so
distant
it
would
hurt
her
feelings
very
much
the
term
little
also
delighted
him
he
said
he
guessed
that
would
make
her
feel
cheap
shepard
and
myself
were
not
quite
so
sure
of
its
aptitude
since
the
chap
who
succeeded
in
capturing
lucretia
on
the
occasion
alluded
to
was
a
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
mallett
however
we
did
not
intimate
our
thoughts
to
mallett
and
he
desired
us
to
go
ahead
and
give
her
another
you
don
t
know
me
madam
if
you
think
you
can
snap
me
up
in
this
way
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
i
can
have
the
company
of
girls
as
much
above
you
as
the
sun
is
above
the
earth
and
i
won
t
stand
any
of
your
impudent
nonsense
no
how
this
was
duly
read
and
approved
now
said
mallett
try
to
touch
her
feelings
remind
her
of
the
pleasant
hours
we
have
spent
together
and
we
continued
as
follows
my
dear
lucretia
when
i
think
of
the
many
pleasant
hours
we
have
spent
together
of
the
delightful
walks
which
we
have
had
on
moonlight
evenings
to
fenner
s
rocks
chestnut
ridge
grassy
plains
wildcat
and
of
the
strolls
which
we
have
taken
upon
shelter
rocks
cedar
hill
the
visits
we
have
made
to
old
lane
wolfpits
and
a
when
all
these
things
come
rushing
on
my
mind
and
when
my
dear
girl
i
remember
how
often
you
have
told
me
that
you
loved
me
better
than
anybody
else
and
i
assured
you
my
feelings
were
the
same
as
yours
it
almost
breaks
my
heart
to
think
of
last
sunday
night
can
t
you
stick
in
some
affecting
poetry
here
said
mallett
shepard
could
not
recollect
any
to
the
point
nor
could
i
but
as
the
exigency
of
the
case
seemed
to
require
it
we
concluded
to
manufacture
a
verse
or
two
which
we
did
as
follows
lucretia
dear
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
use
me
thus
and
so
to
take
the
arm
of
tom
beers
son
and
let
your
dearest
go
miserable
fate
to
lose
you
now
and
tear
this
bleeding
heart
asunder
will
you
forget
your
tender
vow
i
can
t
believe
it
no
by
thunder
mallett
did
not
like
the
word
thunder
but
being
informed
that
no
other
word
could
be
substituted
without
destroying
both
rhyme
and
reason
he
consented
that
it
should
remain
provided
we
added
two
more
stanzas
of
a
nature
something
he
said
that
would
make
the
tears
come
if
possible
we
then
ground
out
the
following
lucretia
dear
do
write
to
jack
and
say
with
beers
you
are
not
smitten
and
thus
to
me
in
love
come
back
and
give
all
other
boys
the
mitten
do
this
lucretia
and
till
death
i
ll
love
you
to
intense
distraction
i
ll
spend
for
you
my
every
breath
and
we
will
live
in
satisfaction
a
these
were
the
euphonious
names
of
localities
in
the
vicinity
of
bethel
that
will
do
very
well
said
mallett
now
i
guess
you
had
better
blow
her
up
a
little
we
obeyed
orders
as
follows
it
makes
me
mad
to
think
what
a
fool
i
was
to
give
you
that
and
and
spend
so
much
time
in
your
company
just
to
be
flirted
and
bamboozled
as
i
was
on
sunday
night
last
if
you
continue
this
course
of
conduct
we
part
for
ever
and
i
will
thank
you
to
send
back
that
jewelry
i
would
sooner
see
it
crushed
under
my
feet
than
worn
by
a
person
who
abused
me
as
you
have
done
i
shall
despise
you
for
ever
if
you
don
t
change
your
conduct
towards
me
and
send
me
a
letter
of
apology
on
monday
next
i
shall
not
go
to
meeting
for
i
would
scorn
to
sit
in
the
same
with
you
until
i
have
an
explanation
of
your
conduct
if
you
allow
any
young
man
to
go
home
with
you
night
i
shall
know
it
for
you
will
be
watched
there
said
mallett
that
is
pretty
strong
now
i
guess
you
had
better
touch
her
feelings
once
more
and
wind
up
the
we
proceeded
as
follows
my
sweet
girl
if
you
only
knew
the
sleepless
nights
which
i
have
spent
during
the
present
week
the
torments
and
sufferings
which
i
endure
on
your
account
if
you
could
but
realize
that
i
regard
the
world
as
less
than
nothing
without
you
i
am
certain
you
would
pity
me
a
homely
cot
and
a
crust
of
bread
with
my
adorable
lucretia
would
be
a
paradise
where
a
palace
without
you
would
be
a
hades
what
in
thunder
is
hades
inquired
jack
we
explained
he
considered
the
figure
rather
bold
and
requested
us
to
close
as
soon
as
possible
now
dearest
in
bidding
you
adieu
i
implore
you
to
reflect
on
our
past
enjoyments
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
our
future
happy
meetings
and
rely
upon
your
affectionate
jack
in
storm
or
calm
in
sickness
distress
or
want
for
all
these
will
be
powerless
to
change
my
love
i
hope
to
hear
from
you
on
monday
next
and
if
favorable
i
shall
be
happy
to
call
on
you
the
same
evening
when
in
ecstatic
joy
we
will
laugh
at
the
past
hope
for
the
future
and
draw
consolation
from
the
fact
that
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
this
from
your
disconsolate
but
still
hoping
lover
and
admirer
jack
mallett
on
reflection
i
have
concluded
to
go
to
meeting
if
all
is
well
hold
your

during
this
season
i
made
arrangements
with
samuel
sherwood
of
bridgeport
to
go
on
an
exploring
expedition
to
pittsburg
pennsylvania
where
we
understood
there
was
a
fine
opening
for
a
lottery
office
and
where
we
meant
to
try
our
fortunes
provided
the
prospects
should
equal
our
expectations
we
went
to
new
york
where
i
had
an
interview
with
dudley
gregory
the
principal
business
man
of
yates
and
mcintyre
who
dissuaded
me
from
going
to
pittsburg
and
offered
me
the
entire
lottery
agency
for
the
state
of
tennessee
if
i
would
go
to
nashville
and
open
an
office
the
offer
was
tempting
but
the
distance
was
too
far
from
a
certain
tailoress
in
bethel
as
the
pittsburg
trip
was
given
up
sherwood
and
i
went
to
philadelphia
for
a
pleasure
excursion
and
put
up
at
congress
hall
in
chestnut
street
where
we
lived
in
much
grander
style
than
we
had
been
accustomed
to
the
array
of
waiters
and
display
of
dishes
were
far
ahead
of
our
former
experiences
and
for
a
week
we
lived
in
clover
at
the
end
of
that
time
however
when
we
concluded
to
start
for
home
the
amount
of
our
hotel
bill
astounded
us
after
paying
it
and
securing
tickets
for
new
york
our
combined
purses
showed
a
balance
of
but
cents
cents
of
this
sum
went
to
the
and
as
our
breakfast
was
included
in
our
bill
we
secured
from
the
table
a
few
biscuits
for
our
dinner
on
the
way
to
new
york
arriving
in
new
york
we
carried
our
own
baggage
to
holt
s
hotel
the
next
morning
sherwood
obtained
a
couple
of
dollars
from
a
friend
and
went
to
newark
and
borrowed
fifty
dollars
from
his
cousin
sherwood
loaning
me
the
sum
after
a
few
days
sojourn
in
the
city
we
returned
home
during
our
stay
in
new
york
i
derived
considerable
information
from
the
city
managers
with
regard
to
the
lottery
business
and
thereafter
i
bought
my
tickets
directly
from
the
connecticut
lottery
managers
at
what
was
termed
the
scheme
price
and
also
established
agencies
throughout
the
country
selling
considerable
quantities
of
tickets
at
handsome
profits
my
uncle
alanson
taylor
joined
me
in
the
business
and
as
we
sold
several
prizes
my
office
came
to
be
considered
lucky
and
i
received
orders
from
all
parts
of
the
country
during
this
time
i
kept
a
close
eye
upon
the
attractive
tailoress
charity
hallett
and
in
the
summer
of
i
asked
her
hand
in
marriage
my
suit
was
accepted
and
the
wedding
day
was
appointed
i
meanwhile
applying
myself
closely
to
business
and
no
one
but
the
parties
immediately
interested
suspecting
that
the
event
was
so
near
at
hand
miss
hallett
went
to
new
york
in
october
ostensibly
to
visit
her
uncle
nathan
beers
who
resided
at
no
allen
street
i
followed
in
november
pressed
by
the
necessity
of
purchasing
goods
for
my
store
and
the
evening
after
my
arrival
november
the
rev
mcauley
married
us
in
the
presence
of
sundry
friends
and
relatives
of
my
wife
and
i
became
the
husband
of
one
of
the
best
women
in
the
world
in
the
course
of
the
week
we
went
back
to
bethel
and
took
board
in
the
family
where
charity
barnum
as
chairy
hallett
had
previously
resided
i
do
not
approve
or
recommend
early
marriages
the
minds
of
men
and
women
taking
so
important
a
step
in
life
should
be
somewhat
matured
and
hasty
marriages
especially
marriages
of
boys
and
girls
have
been
the
cause
of
untold
misery
in
many
instances
but
although
i
was
only
little
more
than
nineteen
years
old
when
i
was
married
i
have
always
felt
assured
that
if
i
had
waited
twenty
years
longer
i
could
not
have
found
another
woman
so
well
suited
to
my
disposition
and
so
admirable
and
valuable
in
every
character
as
a
wife
a
mother
and
a
friend
my
business
occupations
amply
employed
nearly
all
my
time
yet
so
strong
was
my
love
of
fun
that
when
the
opportunity
for
a
practical
joke
presented
itself
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
on
one
occasion
i
engaged
in
the
character
of
counsel
to
conduct
a
case
for
an
irish
peddler
whose
complaint
was
that
one
of
our
neighbors
had
turned
him
out
of
his
house
and
had
otherwise
abused
him
the
court
was
just
as
real
as
the
attorney
no
more
and
consisted
of
three
judges
one
a
mason
the
second
a
butcher
and
the
third
an
old
gentleman
of
leisure
who
was
an
of
the
peace
the
constable
was
of
my
own
appointment
and
my
writ
arrested
the
culprit
who
had
turned
my
client
out
of
house
and
home
the
court
was
convened
but
as
the
culprit
did
not
appear
and
as
it
seemed
necessary
that
my
client
should
get
testimonials
as
to
his
personal
character
the
court
adjourned
nominally
for
one
week
the
client
consenting
to
stand
treat
to
cover
immediate
expenses
i
supposed
that
this
was
the
end
of
it
but
at
the
time
named
for
the
of
the
court
a
lawyer
from
newtown
put
in
an
appearance
he
had
been
engaged
by
the
irishman
to
assist
me
in
conducting
the
case
i
saw
at
once
that
the
joke
was
likely
to
prove
a
sorry
one
and
immediately
notified
the
members
of
the
court
who
were
quite
as
much
alarmed
as
i
was
at
the
serious
turn
the
thing
had
taken
i
need
not
say
that
while
the
danger
threatened
we
all
took
precious
good
care
to
keep
out
of
the
way
however
the
affair
was
explained
to
belden
the
lawyer
who
in
turn
set
forth
the
matter
to
the
client
but
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
soothe
the
anger
so
natural
under
the
circumstances
in
fact
he
advised
the
irishman
to
get
out
of
the
place
as
soon
as
possible
the
irishman
threatened
me
and
my
court
with
prosecution
a
threat
i
really
feared
he
would
carry
into
execution
but
which
to
the
great
peace
of
mind
of
myself
and
my
companions
he
concluded
not
to
follow
up
considering
the
vexation
and
annoyance
of
this
irishman
it
was
a
mitigation
to
know
that
he
was
the
party
in
the
wrong
and
that
he
really
deserved
a
severer
punishment
than
my
practical
joke
had
put
upon
him
in
the
winter
of
my
lottery
business
had
so
extended
that
i
had
branch
offices
in
danbury
norwalk
stamford
and
middletown
as
well
as
agencies
in
the
small
villages
for
thirty
miles
around
bethel
i
had
also
purchased
from
my
grandfather
three
acres
of
land
on
which
i
built
a
house
and
went
to
housekeeping
my
lottery
business
which
was
with
a
few
large
customers
was
so
arranged
that
i
could
safely
entrust
it
to
an
agent
making
it
necessary
for
me
to
find
some
other
field
for
my
individual
enterprise
so
i
tried
my
hand
as
an
auctioneer
in
the
book
trade
i
bought
books
at
the
auctions
and
from
dealers
and
publishers
in
new
york
and
took
them
into
the
country
selling
them
at
auction
and
doing
tolerably
well
only
at
litchfield
connecticut
where
there
was
then
a
law
school
at
newburgh
new
york
several
of
my
best
books
were
stolen
and
i
quit
the
business
in
disgust
in
july
my
uncle
alanson
taylor
and
myself
opened
a
country
store
in
a
building
which
i
had
put
up
in
bethel
in
the
previous
spring
and
we
stocked
the
yellow
store
as
it
was
called
with
a
full
assortment
of
groceries
hardware
crockery
and
notions
but
we
were
not
successful
in
the
enterprise
and
in
october
following
i
bought
out
my
uncle
s
interest
and
we
dissolved
partnership
about
this
time
circumstances
partly
religious
and
partly
political
in
their
character
led
me
into
still
another
field
of
enterprise
which
honorably
opened
to
me
that
notoriety
of
which
in
later
life
i
surely
have
had
a
surfeit
considering
my
youth
this
new
enterprise
reflected
credit
upon
my
ability
as
well
as
energy
and
so
i
may
be
excused
if
i
now
recur
to
it
with
something
like
pride
in
a
period
of
strong
political
excitement
i
wrote
several
communications
for
the
danbury
weekly
paper
setting
forth
what
i
conceived
to
be
the
dangers
of
a
sectarian
interference
which
was
then
apparent
in
political
affairs
the
publication
of
these
communications
was
refused
and
i
accordingly
purchased
a
press
and
types
and
october
i
issued
the
first
number
of
my
own
paper
herald
of
i
entered
upon
the
editorship
of
this
journal
with
all
the
vigor
and
vehemence
of
youth
the
boldness
with
which
the
paper
was
conducted
soon
excited
attention
and
commanded
a
circulation
which
extended
beyond
the
immediate
locality
into
nearly
every
state
in
the
union
but
lacking
that
experience
which
induces
caution
and
without
the
dread
of
consequences
i
frequently
laid
myself
open
to
the
charge
of
libel
and
three
times
in
three
years
i
was
prosecuted
a
danbury
butcher
a
zealous
politician
brought
a
civil
suit
against
me
for
accusing
him
of
being
a
spy
in
a
democratic
caucus
on
the
first
trial
the
jury
did
not
agree
but
after
a
second
trial
i
was
fined
several
hundred
dollars
another
libel
suit
against
me
was
withdrawn
and
need
not
be
mentioned
further
the
third
was
sufficiently
important
to
warrant
the
following
detail
a
criminal
prosecution
was
brought
against
me
for
stating
in
my
paper
that
a
man
in
bethel
prominent
in
the
church
had
been
guilty
of
taking
of
an
orphan
boy
and
for
severely
commenting
on
the
fact
in
my
editorial
columns
when
the
case
came
to
trial
the
truth
of
my
statement
was
substantially
proved
by
illustration
delivery
from
several
witnesses
and
even
by
the
prosecuting
party
but
the
greater
the
truth
the
greater
the
libel
and
then
i
had
used
the
term
usury
instead
of
extortion
or
or
some
other
expression
which
might
have
softened
the
verdict
the
result
was
that
i
was
sentenced
to
pay
a
fine
of
one
hundred
dollars
and
to
be
imprisoned
in
the
common
jail
for
sixty
days
the
most
comfortable
provision
was
made
for
me
in
danbury
jail
my
room
was
papered
and
carpeted
i
lived
well
i
was
overwhelmed
with
the
constant
visits
of
my
friends
i
edited
my
paper
as
usual
and
received
large
accessions
to
my
subscription
list
and
at
the
end
of
my
sixty
days
term
the
event
was
celebrated
by
a
large
concourse
of
people
from
the
surrounding
country
the
court
room
in
which
i
was
convicted
was
the
scene
of
the
celebration
an
ode
written
for
the
occasion
was
sung
an
eloquent
oration
on
the
freedom
of
the
press
was
delivered
and
several
hundred
gentlemen
afterwards
partook
of
a
sumptuous
dinner
followed
by
appropriate
toasts
and
speeches
then
came
the
triumphant
part
of
the
ceremonial
which
was
reported
in
my
paper
of
december
as
follows
p
barnum
and
the
band
of
music
took
their
seats
in
a
coach
drawn
by
six
horses
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
occasion
the
coach
was
preceded
by
forty
horsemen
and
a
marshal
bearing
the
national
standard
immediately
in
the
rear
of
the
coach
was
the
carriage
of
the
orator
and
the
president
of
the
day
followed
by
the
committee
of
arrangements
and
sixty
carriages
of
citizens
which
joined
in
escorting
the
editor
to
his
home
in
bethel
when
the
procession
commenced
its
march
amidst
the
roar
of
cannon
three
cheers
were
given
by
several
hundred
citizens
who
did
not
join
in
the
procession
the
band
of
music
continued
to
play
a
variety
of
national
airs
until
their
arrival
in
bethel
a
distance
of
three
miles
when
they
struck
up
the
beautiful
and
appropriate
tune
of
home
sweet
home
after
giving
three
hearty
cheers
the
procession
returned
to
danbury
the
utmost
harmony
and
unanimity
of
feeling
prevailed
throughout
the
day
and
we
are
happy
to
add
that
no
accident
occurred
to
mar
the
festivities
of
the
my
editorial
career
was
one
of
continual
contest
i
however
published
the
number
of
herald
of
in
danbury
november
after
which
my
john
amerman
issued
the
paper
for
me
at
norwalk
till
the
following
year
when
the
was
sold
to
george
taylor
meanwhile
i
had
taken
horace
fairchild
into
partnership
in
my
mercantile
business
in
and
i
had
sold
out
to
him
and
to
a
toucey
in
they
forming
a
partnership
under
the
firm
of
fairchild
co
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
my
store
was
not
a
success
ordinary
trade
was
too
slow
for
me
i
bought
largely
and
in
order
to
sell
i
was
compelled
to
give
extensive
credits
hence
i
had
an
accumulation
of
bad
debts
and
my
old
ledger
presents
a
long
series
of
accounts
balanced
by
death
by
running
away
by
failing
and
by
other
similarly
remunerative
returns
i
had
expended
money
as
freely
as
i
had
gained
it
for
i
had
already
learned
that
i
could
make
money
rapidly
and
in
large
sums
when
i
set
about
it
with
a
will
and
hence
i
did
not
realize
the
worth
of
what
i
seemed
to
gain
so
readily
i
looked
forward
to
a
future
of
saving
when
i
should
see
the
need
of
accumulation
there
was
nothing
more
for
me
to
do
in
bethel
and
in
the
winter
of
i
removed
my
family
to
new
york
where
i
hired
a
house
in
hudson
street
i
had
no
pecuniary
resources
excepting
such
as
might
be
derived
from
debts
left
for
collection
with
my
agent
at
bethel
and
i
went
to
the
metropolis
literally
to
seek
my
fortune
i
hoped
to
secure
a
situation
in
some
mercantile
house
not
at
a
fixed
salary
but
so
as
to
derive
such
portion
of
the
profits
as
might
be
due
to
my
individual
tact
energy
and
perseverance
in
the
interests
of
the
business
but
i
could
find
no
such
position
my
resources
began
to
fail
my
family
were
in
ill
health
i
must
do
something
for
a
living
and
so
i
acted
as
drummer
to
several
concerns
which
allowed
me
a
small
commission
on
sales
to
customers
of
my
introduction
every
morning
i
used
to
look
at
the
wants
in
the
for
something
that
would
suit
me
and
i
had
many
a
wildgoose
chase
in
following
up
those
in
some
instances
success
depended
upon
my
advancing
from
three
hundred
to
five
hundred
dollars
in
other
cases
a
new
patent
or
a
mouse
trap
was
to
make
my
fortune
an
advertisement
announcing
an
immense
speculation
on
a
small
capital
easily
made
in
one
year
turned
out
to
be
an
offer
of
professor
somebody
at
scudder
s
american
museum
to
sell
a
microscope
offered
to
me
at
two
thousand
dollars
one
thousand
in
cash
and
the
balance
in
sixty
and
ninety
days
on
good
security
and
warranted
to
secure
an
independence
after
a
short
public
exhibition
through
the
country
if
i
had
the
desire
to
undertake
this
exhibition
and
experiment
i
had
not
the
capital
other
and
many
similar
temptations
were
extended
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
open
the
door
of
fortune
to
me
the
advertisement
in
the
of
william
niblo
of
niblo
s
garden
for
a
barkeeper
first
brought
me
in
contact
with
that
gentlemanly
and
proprietor
he
wanted
a
trustworthy
man
to
fill
a
vacant
situation
but
as
he
wished
him
to
bind
himself
to
remain
three
years
i
who
was
only
seeking
the
means
of
temporary
support
was
precluded
from
accepting
the
position
nor
did
all
my
efforts
secure
a
situation
for
me
during
the
whole
winter
but
in
the
spring
i
received
several
hundred
dollars
from
my
agent
in
bethel
and
finding
no
better
business
may
i
opened
a
small
private
at
no
frankfort
street
we
soon
had
a
very
good
run
of
custom
from
our
connecticut
acquaintances
who
had
occasion
to
visit
new
york
and
as
this
business
did
not
sufficiently
occupy
my
time
i
bought
an
interest
with
john
moody
in
a
grocery
store
no
south
street
although
the
years
of
manhood
brought
cares
anxieties
and
struggles
for
a
livelihood
they
did
not
change
my
nature
and
the
jocose
element
was
still
an
essential
ingredient
of
my
being
i
loved
fun
practical
fun
for
itself
and
for
the
enjoyment
which
it
brought
during
the
year
i
occasionally
visited
bridgeport
where
i
almost
always
found
at
the
hotel
a
noted
joker
named
darrow
who
spared
neither
friend
nor
foe
in
his
tricks
he
was
the
life
of
the
and
would
always
try
to
entrap
some
stranger
in
a
bet
and
so
win
a
treat
for
the
company
he
made
several
ineffectual
attempts
upon
me
and
at
last
one
evening
darrow
who
stuttered
made
a
final
trial
as
follows
come
barnum
i
ll
make
you
another
proposition
i
ll
bet
you
hain
t
got
a
whole
shirt
on
your
the
catch
consists
in
the
fact
that
generally
only
of
that
convenient
garment
is
on
the
back
but
i
had
anticipated
the
proposition
in
fact
i
had
induced
a
friend
hough
to
put
darrow
up
to
the
trick
and
had
folded
a
shirt
nicely
upon
my
back
securing
it
there
with
my
suspenders
the
was
crowded
with
customers
who
thought
that
if
i
made
the
bet
i
should
be
nicely
caught
and
i
made
pretence
of
playing
off
and
at
the
same
time
stimulated
darrow
to
press
the
bet
by
saying
that
is
a
foolish
bet
to
make
i
am
sure
my
shirt
is
whole
because
it
is
nearly
new
but
i
don
t
like
to
bet
on
such
a
a
good
reason
why
said
darrow
in
great
glee
it
s
ragged
come
i
ll
bet
you
a
treat
for
the
whole
company
you
hain
t
got
a
whole
shirt
on
your
i
ll
bet
my
shirt
is
cleaner
than
yours
i
replied
that
s
nothing
to
do
the
case
it
s
ragged
and
know
i
know
it
is
not
i
replied
with
pretended
anger
which
caused
the
crowd
to
laugh
heartily
you
poor
ragged
come
down
here
from
i
m
sorry
for
you
said
darrow
tantalizingly
you
would
not
pay
if
you
lost
i
remarked
here
s
dollars
i
ll
put
in
captain
hinman
s
the
landlord
s
hands
now
if
you
dare
you
ragged
i
put
five
dollars
in
captain
hinman
s
hands
and
told
him
to
treat
the
company
from
it
if
i
lost
the
bet
remember
said
darrow
i
you
hain
t
got
a
whole
shirt
on
your
all
right
said
i
taking
off
my
coat
and
commencing
to
unbutton
my
vest
the
whole
company
feeling
sure
that
i
was
caught
began
to
laugh
heartily
old
darrow
fairly
danced
with
delight
and
as
i
laid
my
coat
on
a
chair
he
came
running
up
in
front
of
me
and
slapping
his
hands
together
exclaimed
you
needn
t
off
any
more
for
if
it
ain
t
all
on
your
you
ve
lost
if
it
is
i
suppose
you
have
i
replied
pulling
the
whole
shirt
from
off
my
back
such
a
shriek
of
laughter
as
burst
forth
from
the
crowd
i
scarcely
ever
heard
and
certainly
such
a
blank
countenance
as
old
darrow
exhibited
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
seeing
that
he
was
most
incontinently
done
for
and
perceiving
that
his
neighbor
hough
had
helped
to
do
it
he
ran
up
to
him
in
great
anger
and
shaking
his
fist
in
his
face
exclaimed
you
infernal
to
go
against
your
own
in
favor
of
a
man
i
ll
pay
you
for
that
some
time
you
see
if
i
all
hands
went
up
to
the
bar
and
drank
with
a
hearty
good
will
for
it
was
seldom
that
darrow
got
taken
in
and
he
was
such
an
inveterate
joker
they
liked
to
see
him
paid
in
his
own
coin
never
till
the
day
of
his
death
did
he
hear

by
this

it
was
clear
to
my
mind
that
my
proper
position
in
this
busy
world
was
not
yet
reached
i
had
displayed
the
faculty
of
getting
money
as
well
as
getting
rid
of
it
but
the
business
for
which
i
was
destined
and
i
believe
made
had
not
yet
come
to
me
or
rather
i
had
not
found
that
i
was
to
cater
for
that
insatiate
want
of
human
nature
the
love
of
amusement
that
i
was
to
make
a
sensation
on
two
continents
and
that
fame
and
fortune
awaited
me
so
soon
as
i
should
appear
before
the
public
in
the
character
of
a
showman
these
things
i
had
not
foreseen
i
did
not
seek
the
position
or
the
character
the
business
finally
came
in
my
way
i
fell
into
the
occupation
and
far
beyond
any
of
my
predecessors
on
this
continent
i
have
succeeded
the
show
business
has
all
phases
and
grades
of
dignity
from
the
exhibition
of
a
monkey
to
the
exposition
of
that
highest
art
in
music
or
the
drama
which
entrances
empires
and
secures
for
the
gifted
artist
a
fame
which
princes
well
might
envy
such
art
is
merchantable
and
so
with
the
whole
range
of
amusements
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
the
old
word
trade
as
it
applies
to
buying
cheap
and
selling
at
a
profit
is
as
manifest
here
as
it
is
in
the
dealings
at
a
stand
or
in
stewart
s
store
covering
a
whole
square
this
is
a
trading
world
and
men
women
and
children
who
can
not
live
on
gravity
alone
need
something
to
satisfy
their
gayer
lighter
moods
and
hours
and
he
who
ministers
to
this
want
is
in
a
business
established
by
the
author
of
our
nature
if
he
worthily
fulfils
his
mission
and
amuses
without
corrupting
he
need
never
feel
that
he
has
lived
in
vain
whether
i
may
claim
a
of
grandeur
in
my
career
as
a
dispenser
of
entertainment
for
mankind
i
may
not
say
i
have
sometimes
been
weak
enough
to
think
so
but
let
others
judge
and
whether
i
may
assume
that
on
the
whole
i
have
sought
to
make
amusement
harmless
and
have
succeeded
to
a
very
great
degree
in
eliminating
from
public
entertainments
certain
corruptions
which
have
made
so
many
theatrical
sensations
positively
shameful
may
safely
be
left
i
think
to
the
thousands
upon
thousands
who
have
known
me
and
the
character
of
my
amusement
so
long
and
so
well
but
i
shall
by
no
means
claim
entire
faultlessness
in
my
history
as
a
showman
i
confess
that
i
have
not
always
been
strong
enough
to
rise
out
of
the
exceptional
ways
which
characterize
the
art
of
amusing
not
more
however
than
any
other
art
of
trade
when
in
beginning
business
under
my
own
name
in
bethel
in
i
advertised
that
i
would
sell
goods
per
cent
cheaper
than
any
of
my
neighbors
i
was
guilty
of
a
trick
of
trade
but
so
common
a
trick
that
very
few
who
saw
my
promise
were
struck
with
a
sense
of
any
particular
enormity
therein
while
doubtless
a
good
many
who
claim
to
be
specially
exemplary
thought
they
were
reading
one
of
their
own
advertisements
and
in
the
show
business
i
was
never
guilty
of
a
greater
sin
than
this
against
truthfulness
and
fair
dealing
the
least
deserving
of
all
my
efforts
in
the
show
line
was
the
one
which
introduced
me
to
the
business
a
scheme
in
no
sense
of
my
own
devising
one
which
had
been
sometime
before
the
public
and
which
had
so
many
vouchers
for
its
genuineness
that
at
the
time
of
taking
possession
of
it
i
honestly
believed
it
to
be
genuine
something
too
which
as
i
have
said
i
did
not
seek
but
which
by
accident
came
in
my
way
and
seemed
almost
to
compel
my
agency
such
was
the
joice
heth
exhibition
which
first
brought
me
forward
as
a
showman
in
the
summer
of
coley
bartram
of
reading
connecticut
informed
me
that
he
had
owned
an
interest
in
a
remarkable
negro
woman
whom
he
believed
to
be
one
hundred
and
years
old
and
whom
he
also
believed
to
have
been
the
nurse
of
general
washington
he
then
showed
me
a
copy
of
the
following
advertisement
in
the
of
july
the
citizens
of
philadelphia
and
its
vicinity
have
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
at
the
masonic
hall
one
of
the
greatest
natural
curiosities
ever
witnessed
viz
joyce
heth
a
negress
aged
years
who
formerly
belonged
to
the
father
of
general
washington
she
has
been
a
member
of
the
baptist
church
one
hundred
and
sixteen
years
and
can
rehearse
many
hymns
and
sing
them
according
to
former
custom
she
was
born
near
the
old
potomac
river
in
virginia
and
has
for
ninety
or
one
hundred
years
lived
in
paris
kentucky
with
the
bowling
family
all
who
have
seen
this
extraordinary
woman
are
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
the
account
of
her
age
the
evidence
of
the
bowling
family
which
is
respectable
is
strong
but
the
original
bill
of
sale
of
augustine
washington
in
his
own
handwriting
and
other
evidences
which
the
proprietor
has
in
his
possession
will
satisfy
even
the
most
incredulous
a
lady
will
attend
at
the
hall
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
for
the
accommodation
of
those
ladies
who
may
call
bartram
further
stated
that
he
had
sold
out
his
interest
to
his
partner
lindsay
of
jefferson
county
kentucky
who
was
then
exhibiting
joice
heth
in
philadelphia
but
was
anxious
to
sell
out
and
go
home
the
alleged
reason
being
that
he
had
very
little
tact
as
a
showman
as
the
new
york
papers
had
also
contained
some
account
of
joice
heth
i
went
on
to
philadelphia
to
see
lindsay
and
his
exhibition
joice
heth
was
certainly
a
remarkable
curiosity
and
she
looked
as
if
she
might
have
been
far
older
than
her
age
as
advertised
she
was
apparently
in
good
health
and
spirits
but
from
age
or
disease
or
both
was
unable
to
change
her
position
she
could
move
one
arm
at
will
but
her
lower
limbs
could
not
be
straightened
her
left
arm
lay
across
her
breast
and
she
could
not
remove
it
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
were
drawn
down
so
as
nearly
to
close
it
and
were
fixed
the
nails
on
that
hand
were
almost
four
inches
long
and
extended
above
her
wrist
the
nails
on
her
large
toes
had
grown
to
the
thickness
of
a
quarter
of
an
inch
her
head
was
covered
with
a
thick
bush
of
grey
hair
but
she
was
toothless
and
totally
blind
and
her
eyes
had
sunk
so
deeply
in
the
sockets
as
to
have
disappeared
altogether
nevertheless
she
was
pert
and
sociable
and
would
talk
as
long
as
people
would
converse
with
her
she
was
quite
garrulous
about
her
dear
little
george
at
whose
birth
she
declared
she
was
present
having
been
at
the
time
a
slave
of
elizabeth
atwood
a
of
augustine
washington
the
father
of
george
washington
as
nurse
she
put
the
first
clothes
on
the
infant
and
she
claimed
to
have
raised
she
professed
to
be
a
member
of
the
baptist
church
talking
much
in
her
way
on
religious
subjects
and
she
sang
a
variety
of
ancient
hymns
in
proof
of
her
extraordinary
age
and
pretensions
lindsay
exhibited
a
bill
of
sale
dated
february
from
augustine
washington
county
of
westmoreland
virginia
to
elizabeth
atwood
a
and
neighbor
of
washington
conveying
one
negro
woman
named
joice
heth
aged
years
for
and
in
consideration
of
the
sum
of
pounds
lawful
money
of
it
was
further
claimed
that
as
she
had
long
been
a
nurse
in
the
washington
family
she
was
called
in
at
the
birth
of
george
and
clothed
the
infant
the
evidence
seemed
authentic
and
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
why
so
remarkable
a
discovery
had
not
been
made
before
a
satisfactory
explanation
was
given
in
the
statement
that
she
had
been
carried
from
virginia
to
kentucky
had
been
on
the
plantation
of
john
bowling
so
long
that
no
one
knew
or
cared
how
old
she
was
and
only
recently
the
accidental
discovery
by
bowling
s
son
of
the
old
bill
of
sale
in
the
record
office
in
virginia
had
led
to
the
identification
of
this
negro
woman
as
the
nurse
of
everything
seemed
so
straightforward
that
i
was
anxious
to
become
proprietor
of
this
novel
exhibition
which
was
offered
to
me
at
one
thousand
dollars
though
the
price
first
demanded
was
three
thousand
i
had
five
hundred
dollars
borrowed
five
hundred
dollars
more
sold
out
my
interest
in
the
grocery
business
to
my
partner
and
began
life
as
a
showman
at
the
outset
of
my
career
i
saw
that
everything
depended
upon
getting
people
to
think
and
talk
and
become
curious
and
excited
over
and
about
the
rare
accordingly
posters
transparencies
advertisements
newspaper
paragraphs
all
calculated
to
extort
attention
were
employed
regardless
of
expense
my
exhibition
rooms
in
new
york
boston
philadelphia
albany
and
in
other
large
and
small
cities
were
continually
thronged
and
much
money
was
made
in
the
following
february
joice
heth
died
literally
of
old
age
and
her
remains
received
a
respectable
burial
in
the
town
of
bethel
at
a
examination
of
joice
heth
by
david
rogers
in
the
presence
of
some
medical
students
it
was
thought
that
the
absence
of
ossification
indicated
considerably
less
age
than
had
been
assumed
for
her
but
the
doctors
disagreed
and
this
dark
subject
will
probably
always
continue
to
be
shrouded
in
mystery
i
had
at
last
found
my
true
vocation
indeed
soon
after
i
began
to
exhibit
joice
heth
i
had
entrusted
her
to
an
agent
and
had
entered
upon
my
second
step
in
the
show
line
the
next
venture
whatever
it
may
have
been
in
other
respects
had
the
merit
of
being
in
every
essential
unmistakably
genuine
i
engaged
from
the
albany
museum
an
italian
who
called
himself
signor
antonio
and
who
performed
certain
remarkable
feats
of
balancing
etc
he
had
gone
from
england
to
canada
and
thence
to
albany
and
had
performed
in
other
american
cities
i
made
terms
with
him
for
one
year
to
exhibit
anywhere
in
the
united
states
at
twelve
dollars
a
week
and
expenses
and
induced
him
to
change
his
stage
name
to
signor
i
then
wrote
a
notice
of
his
wonderful
qualities
and
performances
printed
it
in
one
of
the
albany
papers
as
news
sent
copies
to
the
theatrical
managers
in
new
york
and
in
other
cities
and
went
with
vivalla
to
the
metropolis
manager
william
dinneford
of
the
franklin
theatre
had
seen
so
many
performances
of
the
kind
that
he
declined
to
engage
my
eminent
italian
artist
but
i
persuaded
him
to
try
vivalla
one
night
for
nothing
and
by
the
potent
aid
of
printer
s
ink
the
house
was
crammed
i
appeared
as
a
supernumerary
to
assist
vivalla
in
arranging
his
plates
and
other
properties
and
to
hand
him
his
gun
to
fire
while
he
was
hopping
on
one
stilt
ten
feet
high
this
was
my
first
appearance
on
any
the
applause
which
followed
vivalla
s
feats
was
tremendous
and
manager
dinneford
was
so
delighted
that
he
engaged
him
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
at
fifty
dollars
at
the
close
of
the
performance
in
response
to
a
call
from
the
house
i
made
a
speech
for
vivalla
thanking
the
audience
for
their
appreciation
and
announcing
a
repetition
of
the
exhibition
every
evening
during
the
week
vivalla
remained
a
second
week
at
the
franklin
theatre
for
which
i
received
i
realized
the
same
sum
for
a
week
in
boston
we
then
went
to
washington
to
fulfil
an
engagement
which
was
far
from
successful
since
my
remuneration
depended
upon
the
receipts
and
it
snowed
continually
during
the
week
i
was
a
loser
to
such
an
extent
that
i
had
not
funds
enough
to
return
to
philadelphia
i
pawned
my
watch
and
chain
for
dollars
when
fortunately
manager
wemyss
arrived
on
saturday
morning
and
loaned
me
the
money
to
redeem
my
property
as
this
was
my
first
visit
to
washington
i
was
much
interested
in
visiting
the
capitol
and
other
public
buildings
i
also
satisfied
my
curiosity
in
seeing
clay
calhoun
benton
john
quincy
adams
richard
johnson
polk
and
other
leading
statesmen
of
the
time
i
was
also
greatly
gratified
in
calling
upon
anne
royall
author
of
the
black
book
publisher
of
a
little
paper
called
paul
pry
and
quite
a
celebrated
personage
in
her
day
i
had
exchanged
herald
of
with
her
journal
and
she
strongly
sympathized
with
me
in
my
persecutions
she
was
delighted
to
see
me
and
although
she
was
the
most
garrulous
old
woman
i
ever
saw
i
passed
a
very
amusing
and
pleasant
time
with
her
before
leaving
her
i
manifested
my
showman
propensity
by
trying
to
hire
her
to
give
a
dozen
or
more
lectures
on
government
in
the
atlantic
cities
but
i
could
not
engage
her
at
any
price
although
i
am
sure
the
speculation
would
have
been
a
very
profitable
one
i
never
saw
this
eccentric
woman
again
she
died
at
a
very
advanced
age
october
at
her
residence
in
washington
i
went
with
vivalla
to
philadelphia
and
opened
at
the
walnut
street
theatre
though
his
performances
were
very
meritorious
and
were
well
received
theatricals
were
dull
and
houses
were
slim
it
was
evident
that
something
must
be
done
to
stimulate
the
public
and
now
that
instinct
i
think
it
must
be
which
can
arouse
a
community
and
make
it
patronize
provided
the
article
offered
is
worthy
of
patronage
an
instinct
which
served
me
strangely
in
later
years
astonishing
the
public
and
surprising
me
came
to
my
relief
and
the
help
curiously
enough
appeared
in
the
shape
of
an
emphatic
hiss
from
the
pit
this
hiss
i
discovered
came
from
one
roberts
a
circus
performer
and
i
had
an
interview
with
him
he
was
a
professional
balancer
and
juggler
who
boasted
that
he
could
do
all
vivalla
had
done
and
something
more
i
at
once
published
a
card
in
vivalla
s
name
offering
to
any
one
who
would
publicly
perform
vivalla
s
feats
at
such
place
as
should
be
designated
and
roberts
issued
a
counter
card
accepting
the
offer
i
then
contracted
with
warren
treasurer
of
the
walnut
theatre
for
of
the
proceeds
if
i
should
bring
the
receipts
up
to
a
night
an
agreement
he
could
well
afford
to
make
as
his
receipts
the
night
before
had
been
but
dollars
from
him
i
went
to
roberts
who
seemed
disposed
to
back
down
but
i
told
him
i
should
not
insist
upon
the
terms
of
his
published
card
and
asked
him
if
he
was
under
any
engagement
learning
that
he
was
not
i
offered
him
thirty
dollars
to
perform
under
my
direction
one
night
at
the
walnut
and
he
accepted
a
great
trial
of
skill
between
roberts
and
vivalla
was
duly
announced
by
posters
and
through
the
press
meanwhile
they
rehearsed
privately
to
see
what
tricks
each
could
perform
and
the
business
was
completely
arranged
public
excitement
was
at
fever
heat
and
on
the
night
of
the
trial
the
pit
and
upper
boxes
were
crowded
to
the
full
indeed
sales
of
tickets
to
these
localities
were
soon
stopped
for
there
were
no
seats
to
sell
the
contest
between
the
performers
was
eager
and
each
had
his
party
in
the
house
so
far
as
i
could
learn
no
one
complained
that
he
did
not
get
all
he
paid
for
on
that
occasion
i
engaged
roberts
for
a
month
and
his
subsequent
contests
with
vivalla
amused
the
public
and
put
money
in
my
purse
vivalla
continued
to
perform
for
me
in
various
places
including
peale
s
museum
in
new
york
and
i
took
him
to
different
towns
in
connecticut
and
in
new
jersey
with
poor
success
sometimes
as
frequently
the
expenses
exceeded
the
receipts
in
april
i
connected
myself
with
aaron
turner
s
travelling
circus
company
as
secretary
and
treasurer
at
thirty
dollars
a
month
and
of
the
entire
profits
while
vivalla
was
to
receive
a
salary
of
fifty
dollars
as
i
was
already
paying
him
eighty
dollars
a
month
our
joint
salaries
reimbursed
me
and
left
me
the
chance
of
twenty
per
cent
of
the
net
receipts
we
started
from
danbury
for
west
springfield
massachusetts
april
and
on
the
first
day
instead
of
halting
to
dine
as
i
expected
turner
regaled
the
whole
company
with
three
loaves
of
rye
bread
and
a
pound
of
butter
bought
at
a
farm
house
at
a
cost
of
fifty
cents
and
after
watering
the
horses
we
went
on
our
way
we
began
our
performances
at
west
springfield
april
and
as
our
expected
band
of
music
had
not
arrived
from
providence
i
made
a
prefatory
speech
announcing
our
disappointment
and
our
intention
to
please
our
patrons
nevertheless
the
two
turner
boys
sons
of
the
proprietor
rode
finely
joe
pentland
one
of
the
wittiest
best
and
most
original
of
clowns
with
vivalla
s
tricks
and
other
performances
in
the
ring
more
than
made
up
for
the
lack
of
music
in
a
day
or
two
our
band
arrived
and
our
houses
improved
my
diary
is
full
of
incidents
of
our
summer
tour
through
numerous
villages
towns
and
cities
in
new
england
new
york
new
jersey
pennsylvania
delaware
maryland
district
of
columbia
virginia
and
north
carolina
while
we
were
at
cabotville
massachusetts
on
going
to
bed
one
night
one
of
my
threw
a
lighted
stump
of
a
cigar
into
a
filled
with
sawdust
and
the
result
was
that
about
one
o
clock
turner
who
slept
in
the
room
awoke
in
the
midst
of
a
dense
smoke
and
barely
managed
to
crawl
to
the
window
to
open
it
and
to
awaken
us
in
time
to
save
us
from
suffocation
at
lenox
massachusetts
one
sunday
i
attended
church
as
usual
and
the
preacher
denounced
our
circus
and
all
connected
with
it
as
immoral
and
was
very
abusive
whereupon
when
he
had
read
the
closing
hymn
i
walked
up
the
pulpit
stairs
and
handed
him
a
written
request
signed
p
barnum
connected
with
the
circus
june
to
be
permitted
to
reply
to
him
he
declined
to
notice
it
and
after
the
benediction
i
lectured
him
for
not
giving
me
an
opportunity
to
vindicate
myself
and
those
with
whom
i
was
connected
the
affair
created
considerable
excitement
and
some
of
the
members
of
the
church
apologized
to
me
for
their
clergyman
s
a
similar
affair
happened
afterwards
at
port
deposit
on
the
lower
susquehanna
and
in
this
instance
i
addressed
the
audience
for
half
an
hour
defending
the
circus
company
against
the
attacks
of
the
clergyman
and
the
people
listened
though
their
pastor
repeatedly
implored
them
to
go
home
often
have
i
collected
our
company
on
sunday
and
read
to
them
the
bible
or
a
printed
sermon
and
one
or
more
of
the
men
frequently
accompanied
me
to
church
we
made
no
pretence
of
religion
but
we
were
not
the
worst
people
in
the
world
and
we
thought
ourselves
entitled
to
at
least
decent
treatment
when
we
went
to
hear
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
the
proprietor
of
the
circus
aaron
turner
was
a
man
who
had
acquired
a
large
fortune
by
his
industry
he
believed
that
any
man
with
health
and
common
sense
could
become
rich
if
he
only
resolved
to
be
so
and
he
was
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
began
the
world
with
no
advantages
no
education
and
without
a
shilling
withal
he
was
a
practical
joker
as
i
more
than
once
discovered
to
my
cost
while
we
were
at
annapolis
maryland
he
played
a
trick
upon
me
which
was
fun
to
him
but
was
very
nearly
death
to
me
we
arrived
on
saturday
night
and
as
i
felt
quite
flush
i
bought
a
fine
suit
of
black
clothes
on
sunday
morning
i
dressed
myself
in
my
new
suit
and
started
out
for
a
stroll
while
passing
through
the
turner
called
the
attention
of
the
company
present
to
me
and
said
i
think
it
very
singular
you
permit
that
rascal
to
march
your
streets
in
open
day
it
wouldn
t
be
allowed
in
rhode
island
and
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
the
scoundrel
has
come
down
this
why
who
is
he
asked
half
a
dozen
at
once
don
t
you
know
why
that
is
the
rev
avery
the
murderer
of
miss
cornell
is
it
possible
they
exclaimed
all
starting
for
the
door
eager
to
get
a
look
at
me
and
swearing
vengeance
it
was
only
recently
that
the
rev
ephraim
avery
had
been
tried
in
rhode
island
for
the
murder
of
miss
cornell
whose
body
was
discovered
in
a
and
though
avery
was
acquitted
in
court
the
general
sentiment
of
the
country
condemned
him
it
was
this
avery
whom
turner
made
me
represent
i
had
not
walked
far
in
my
fine
clothes
before
i
was
overtaken
by
a
mob
of
a
dozen
which
rapidly
increased
to
at
least
a
hundred
and
my
ears
were
suddenly
saluted
with
such
observations
as
the
lecherous
old
hypocrite
the
sanctified
murderer
the
villain
lynch
the
scoundrel
let
s
tar
and
feather
him
and
like
remarks
which
i
had
no
idea
applied
to
me
till
one
man
seized
me
by
the
collar
while
five
or
six
more
appeared
on
the
scene
with
a
rail
come
said
the
man
who
collared
me
old
chap
you
can
t
walk
any
further
we
know
you
and
as
we
always
make
gentlemen
ride
in
these
parts
you
may
just
prepare
to
straddle
that
rail
my
surprise
may
be
imagined
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
as
they
all
pressed
around
me
gentlemen
what
have
i
done
oh
we
know
you
exclaimed
half
a
dozen
voices
you
needn
t
roll
your
sanctimonious
eyes
that
game
don
t
take
in
this
country
come
straddle
the
rail
and
the
i
grew
more
and
more
bewildered
i
could
not
imagine
what
possible
offence
i
was
to
suffer
for
and
i
continued
to
exclaim
gentlemen
what
have
i
done
don
t
kill
me
gentlemen
but
tell
me
what
i
have
come
make
him
straddle
the
rail
well
show
him
how
to
hang
poor
factory
girls
shouted
a
man
in
the
crowd
the
man
who
had
me
by
the
collar
then
remarked
come
it
s
no
use
you
see
we
know
you
and
we
ll
give
you
a
touch
of
lynch
law
and
start
you
for
home
my
name
is
avery
gentlemen
you
are
mistaken
in
your
man
i
exclaimed
come
come
none
of
your
gammon
straddle
the
rail
the
rail
was
brought
and
i
was
about
to
be
placed
on
it
when
the
truth
flashed
upon
me
gentlemen
i
exclaimed
i
am
not
avery
i
despise
that
villain
as
much
as
you
can
my
name
is
barnum
i
belong
to
the
circus
which
arrived
here
last
night
and
i
am
sure
old
turner
my
partner
has
hoaxed
you
with
this
ridiculous
if
he
has
we
ll
lynch
him
said
one
of
the
mob
well
he
has
i
ll
assure
you
and
if
you
will
walk
to
the
hotel
with
me
i
ll
convince
you
of
the
this
they
reluctantly
assented
to
keeping
however
a
close
hand
upon
me
as
we
walked
up
the
main
street
the
mob
received
a
of
some
fifty
or
sixty
and
i
was
marched
like
a
malefactor
up
to
the
hotel
old
turner
stood
on
the
piazza
ready
to
explode
with
laughter
i
appealed
to
him
for
heaven
s
sake
to
explain
this
matter
that
i
might
be
liberated
he
continued
to
laugh
but
finally
told
them
he
believed
there
was
some
mistake
about
it
the
fact
is
said
he
my
friend
barnum
has
a
new
suit
of
black
clothes
on
and
he
looks
so
much
like
a
priest
that
i
thought
he
must
be
the
crowd
saw
the
joke
and
seemed
satisfied
my
new
coat
had
been
half
torn
from
my
back
and
i
had
been
very
roughly
handled
but
some
of
the
crowd
apologized
for
the
outrage
declaring
that
turner
ought
to
be
served
in
the
same
way
while
others
advised
me
to
get
even
with
i
was
very
much
offended
and
when
the
mob
dispersed
i
asked
turner
what
could
have
induced
him
to
play
such
a
trick
upon
me
illustration
on
a
my
dear
barnum
he
replied
it
was
all
for
our
good
remember
all
we
need
to
insure
success
is
notoriety
you
will
see
that
this
will
be
noised
all
about
town
as
a
trick
played
by
one
of
the
circus
managers
upon
the
other
and
our
pavilion
will
be
crammed
it
was
even
so
the
trick
was
told
all
over
town
and
every
one
came
to
see
the
circus
managers
who
were
in
a
habit
of
playing
practical
jokes
upon
each
other
we
had
fine
audiences
while
we
remained
at
annapolis
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
forgave
turner
for
his
rascally

occurred
when
we
were
at

court
house
in

it
rained
so
heavily
that
we
could
not
perform
there
and
turner
decided
to
start
for
richmond
immediately
after
dinner
when
he
was
informed
by
the
landlord
that
as
our
agent
had
engaged
three
meals

for
the
whole

the
entire
bill
must
be
paid
whether
we
went
then
or
next
morning
no
compromise
could
be
effected
with
the
stubborn
landlord
and
so
turner
proceeded
to
get
the
worth
of
his
money
as
follows
he
ordered
dinner
at
twelve
o

which
was
duly
prepared
and
eaten

we
all
undressed

tumbled
into

as
if
we
were
going
to
stay
all
night
in
half
an
hour
we
rose
and
went
down
to
the
hot
breakfast
which
turner
had
demanded
and
which
we
found
smoking
on
the
table
turner
was
very
grave
the
landlord
was
exceedingly
angry
and
the
rest
of
us
were
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
proceeding
we
disposed
of
our
breakfast
as
if
we
had
eaten
nothing
for
ten
hours
and
then
started
for
richmond
with
the
satisfaction
that
we
fairly
settled
with
our
unreasonable
landlord
at
richmond
after
performances
were
over
one
night
i
managed
to
partially
pay
turner
for
his
avery
trick
a
dozen
or
more
of
us
were
enjoying
ourselves
in
the
sitting
room
of
the
hotel
telling
stories
and
singing
songs
when
some
of
the
company
proposed
sundry
amusing
arithmetical
questions
followed
by
one
from
turner
which
was
readily
solved
hoping
to
catch
turner
i
then
proposed
the
following
problem
suppose
a
man
is
thirty
years
of
age
and
he
has
a
child
one
year
of
age
he
is
thirty
times
older
than
his
child
when
the
child
is
thirty
years
old
the
father
being
sixty
is
only
twice
as
old
as
his
child
when
the
child
is
sixty
the
father
is
ninety
and
therefore
only
older
than
the
child
when
the
child
is
ninety
the
father
is
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
therefore
only
older
than
the
child
thus
you
see
the
child
is
gradually
but
surely
gaining
on
the
parent
and
as
he
certainly
continues
to
come
nearer
and
nearer
in
time
he
must
overtake
him
the
question
therefore
is
suppose
it
was
possible
for
them
to
live
long
enough
how
old
would
the
father
be
when
the
child
overtook
him
and
became
of
the
same
age
the
company
generally
saw
the
catch
but
turner
was
very
much
interested
in
the
problem
and
although
he
admitted
he
knew
nothing
about
arithmetic
he
was
convinced
that
as
the
son
was
gradually
gaining
on
the
father
he
must
reach
him
if
there
was
time
enough
say
a
thousand
years
or
so
for
the
race
but
an
old
gentleman
gravely
remarked
that
the
idea
of
a
son
becoming
as
old
as
his
father
while
both
were
living
was
simply
nonsense
and
he
offered
to
bet
a
dozen
of
champagne
that
the
thing
was
impossible
even
in
turner
who
was
a
betting
man
and
who
thought
the
problem
might
be
proved
accepted
the
wager
but
he
was
soon
convinced
that
however
much
the
boy
might
relatively
gain
upon
his
father
there
would
always
be
thirty
years
difference
in
their
ages
the
champagne
cost
him
and
he
failed
to
see
the
fun
of
my
arithmetic
though
at
last
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
a
fair
offset
to
the
avery
trick
we
went
from
richmond
to
petersburg
and
from
that
place
to
warrenton
north
carolina
where
october
my
engagement
expired
with
a
profit
to
myself
of
i
now
separated
from
the
circus
company
taking
vivalla
james
sanford
a
negro
singer
and
dancer
several
musicians
horses
wagons
and
a
small
canvas
tent
with
which
i
intended
to
begin
a
travelling
exhibition
of
my
own
my
company
started
and
turner
took
me
on
the
way
in
his
own
carriage
some
twenty
miles
we
parted
reluctantly
and
my
friend
wished
me
every
success
in
my
new
venture
on
saturday
november
we
halted
at
rocky
mount
falls
north
carolina
and
on
my
way
to
the
baptist
church
sunday
morning
i
noticed
a
stand
and
benches
in
a
grove
near
by
and
determined
to
speak
to
the
people
if
i
was
permitted
the
landlord
who
was
with
me
said
that
the
congregation
coming
from
a
distance
to
attend
a
single
service
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
a
stranger
and
i
accordingly
asked
the
venerable
clergyman
to
announce
that
after
service
i
would
speak
for
half
an
hour
in
the
grove
learning
that
i
was
not
a
clergyman
he
declined
to
give
the
notice
but
said
that
he
had
no
objection
to
my
making
the
announcement
which
i
did
and
the
congregation
numbering
about
three
hundred
promptly
came
to
hear
me
i
told
them
i
was
not
a
preacher
and
had
very
little
experience
in
public
speaking
but
i
felt
a
deep
interest
in
matters
of
morality
and
religion
and
would
attempt
in
a
plain
way
to
set
before
them
the
duties
and
privileges
of
man
i
appealed
to
every
man
s
experience
observation
and
reason
to
confirm
the
bible
doctrine
of
wretchedness
in
vice
and
happiness
in
virtue
we
can
not
violate
the
laws
of
god
with
impunity
and
he
will
not
keep
back
the
wages
of
the
outside
show
of
things
is
of
very
small
account
we
must
look
to
realities
and
not
to
appearances
diamonds
may
glitter
on
a
vicious
breast
but
the
soul
s
calm
sunshine
and
the
joy
is
virtue
s
the
rogue
the
passionate
man
the
drunkard
are
not
to
be
envied
even
at
the
best
and
a
conscience
hardened
by
sin
is
the
most
sorrowful
possession
we
can
think
of
i
went
on
in
this
way
with
some
scriptural
quotations
and
familiar
illustrations
for
of
an
hour
at
the
close
of
my
address
several
persons
took
me
by
the
hand
expressing
themselves
as
greatly
pleased
and
desiring
to
know
my
name
and
i
went
away
with
the
feeling
that
possibly
i
might
have
done
some
good
in
the
beautiful
grove
on
that
charming
sunday
morning
when
we
were
at
camden
south
carolina
sanford
suddenly
left
me
and
as
i
had
advertised
negro
songs
and
none
of
my
company
was
competent
to
fill
sanford
s
place
not
to
disappoint
my
audience
i
blacked
myself
and
sung
the
advertised
songs
zip
coon
and
to
my
surprise
was
much
applauded
while
two
of
the
songs
were
encored
one
evening
after
singing
my
songs
i
heard
a
disturbance
outside
the
tent
and
going
to
the
spot
found
a
person
disputing
with
my
men
i
took
part
on
the
side
of
the
men
when
the
person
who
was
quarrelling
with
them
drew
a
pistol
and
exclaiming
you
black
scoundrel
how
dare
you
use
such
language
to
a
white
man
he
proceeded
to
cock
it
i
saw
that
he
thought
i
was
a
negro
and
meant
to
blow
my
brains
out
quick
as
thought
i
rolled
my
sleeve
up
showed
my
skin
and
said
i
am
as
white
as
you
are
he
dropped
his
pistol
in
positive
fright
and
begged
my
pardon
my
presence
of
mind
saved
me
on
four
different
occasions
in
my
life
i
have
had
a
loaded
pistol
pointed
at
my
head
and
each
time
i
have
escaped
death
by
what
seemed
a
miracle
i
have
also
often
been
in
deadly
peril
by
accidents
and
when
i
think
of
these
things
i
realize
my
indebtedness
to
an
providence
reviewing
my
career
too
and
considering
the
kind
of
company
i
kept
for
years
and
the
associations
with
which
i
was
surrounded
and
connected
i
am
surprised
as
well
as
grateful
that
i
was
not
ruined
i
honestly
believe
that
i
owe
my
preservation
from
the
degradation
of
living
and
dying
a
loafer
and
a
vagabond
to
the
single
fact
that
i
was
never
addicted
to
strong
drink
to
be
sure
i
have
in
times
past
drank
liquor
but
i
have
generally
wholly
abstained
from
intoxicating
beverages
and
for
more
than
twenty
years
past
i
am
glad
to
say
i
have
been
a
strict
at
camden
i
lost
one
of
my
musicians
a
scotchman
named
cochran
who
was
arrested
for
advising
the
negro
barber
who
was
shaving
him
to
run
away
to
the
free
states
or
to
canada
i
made
every
effort
to
effect
cochran
s
release
but
he
was
imprisoned
more
than
six
months
while
i
was
away
from
home
i
generally
wrote
twice
a
week
to
my
family
and
received
letters
nearly
as
often
from
my
wife
one
of
her
letters
which
i
received
in
columbia
south
carolina
informed
me
it
was
currently
reported
in
connecticut
that
i
was
under
sentence
of
death
in
canada
for
murder
the
story
grew
out
of
a
rumor
about
a
difficulty
in
canada
between
some
rowdies
and
a
circus
company
not
turner
s
for
we
met
his
troupe
at
columbia
december
that
company
was
then
to
be
disbanded
and
i
bought
four
horses
and
two
wagons
and
hired
joe
pentland
and
robert
white
to
join
my
company
white
as
a
would
relieve
me
from
that
roll
and
pentland
besides
being
a
capital
clown
was
celebrated
as
a
ventriloquist
comic
singer
balancer
and
legerdemain
performer
my
exhibition
was
called
barnum
s
grand
scientific
and
musical
some
time
previously
in
raleigh
north
carolina
i
had
sold
of
my
establishment
to
a
man
whom
i
will
call
henry
who
now
acted
as
treasurer
and
at
augusta
georgia
the
sheriff
served
a
writ
upon
this
henry
for
a
debt
of
as
henry
had
of
the
company
s
money
in
his
possession
i
immediately
procured
a
bill
of
sale
of
all
his
property
in
the
exhibition
and
returned
to
the
theatre
where
henry
s
creditor
and
the
creditor
s
lawyer
were
waiting
for
me
they
demanded
the
keys
of
the
stable
so
as
to
levy
on
the
horses
and
wagons
i
begged
delay
till
i
could
see
henry
and
they
consented
henry
was
anxious
to
cheat
his
creditor
and
he
at
once
signed
the
bill
of
sale
i
returned
and
informed
the
creditor
that
henry
refused
to
pay
or
compromise
the
claim
the
sheriff
then
demanded
the
keys
of
the
stable
door
to
attach
henry
s
interest
in
the
property
not
yet
said
i
showing
a
bill
of
sale
you
see
i
am
in
full
possession
of
the
property
as
entire
owner
you
confess
that
you
have
not
yet
levied
on
it
and
if
you
touch
my
property
you
do
it
at
your
they
were
very
much
taken
aback
and
the
sheriff
immediately
conveyed
henry
to
prison
the
next
day
i
learned
that
henry
owed
his
creditors
thirteen
hundred
dollars
and
that
he
had
agreed
when
the
saturday
evening
performance
was
ended
to
hand
over
five
hundred
dollars
company
money
and
a
bill
of
sale
of
his
interest
in
consideration
of
which
one
of
the
horses
was
to
be
ready
for
him
to
run
away
with
leaving
me
in
the
lurch
learning
this
i
had
very
little
sympathy
for
henry
and
my
next
step
was
to
secure
the
five
hundred
dollars
he
had
secreted
vivalla
had
obtained
it
from
him
to
keep
it
from
the
sheriff
i
received
it
from
vivalla
on
henry
s
order
as
a
supposed
means
of
procuring
bail
for
him
on
monday
morning
i
then
paid
the
creditor
the
full
amount
obtained
from
henry
as
the
price
of
his
half
interest
in
the
exhibition
and
received
in
return
an
assignment
of
five
hundred
dollars
of
the
creditor
s
claims
and
a
guaranty
that
i
should
not
be
troubled
by
my
late
partner
on
that
score
thus
promptness
of
action
and
good
luck
relieved
me
from
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
positions
in
which
i
had
ever
been
placed
while
travelling
with
our
teams
and
show
through
a
desolate
part
of
georgia
our
advertiser
who
was
in
advance
of
the
party
finding
the
route
on
one
occasion
too
long
for
us
to
reach
a
town
at
night
arranged
with
a
poor
widow
woman
named
hayes
to
furnish
us
with
meals
and
let
us
lodge
in
her
hut
and
it
was
a
beggarly
place
belonging
to
one
of
the
poorest
of
poor
our
horses
were
to
stand
out
all
night
and
a
farmer
six
miles
distant
was
to
bring
a
load
of
provender
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
bills
were
then
posted
announcing
a
performance
under
a
canvas
tent
near
widow
hayes
s
for
as
a
show
was
a
rarity
in
that
region
it
was
conjectured
that
a
hundred
or
more
small
farmers
and
poor
whites
might
be
assembled
and
that
the
receipts
would
cover
the
expenses
meanwhile
our
advertiser
who
was
quite
a
wag
wrote
back
informing
us
of
the
difficulties
of
reaching
a
town
on
that
part
of
our
route
and
stating
that
he
had
made
arrangements
for
us
to
stay
over
night
on
the
plantation
of
lady
hayes
and
that
although
the
country
was
sparsely
settled
we
could
doubtless
give
a
profitable
performance
to
a
fair
audience
anticipating
a
fine
time
on
this
noble
plantation
we
started
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
so
as
to
arrive
at
one
o
clock
thus
avoiding
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
towards
noon
we
came
to
a
small
river
where
some
men
whom
we
afterwards
discovered
to
be
yankees
from
maine
were
repairing
a
bridge
every
flooring
plank
had
been
taken
up
and
it
was
impossible
for
our
teams
to
cross
could
the
bridge
be
fixed
so
that
we
could
go
over
i
inquired
no
it
would
take
half
a
day
and
meantime
if
we
must
cross
there
was
a
place
about
sixteen
miles
down
the
river
where
we
could
get
but
we
can
t
go
so
far
as
that
we
are
under
engagement
to
perform
on
lady
hayes
s
place
and
we
must
cross
here
fix
the
bridge
and
we
will
pay
you
they
wanted
no
money
but
if
we
would
give
them
some
tickets
to
our
show
they
thought
they
might
do
something
for
us
i
gladly
consented
and
in
fifteen
minutes
we
crossed
that
bridge
the
cunning
rascals
had
seen
our
posters
and
knew
we
were
coming
so
they
had
taken
up
the
planks
of
the
bridge
and
had
hidden
them
till
they
had
levied
upon
us
for
tickets
when
the
floor
was
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
laughed
heartily
at
the
trick
and
were
very
glad
to
cross
so
cheaply
towards
dinner
time
we
began
to
look
out
for
the
grand
mansion
of
lady
hayes
and
seeing
nothing
but
little
huts
we
quietly
pursued
our
journey
at
one
o
clock
the
time
when
we
should
have
arrived
at
our
destination
i
became
impatient
and
riding
up
to
a
hovel
and
seeing
a
ragged
barefooted
old
woman
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
to
her
shoulders
who
was
washing
clothes
in
front
of
the
door
i
inquired
hallo
can
you
tell
me
where
lady
hayes
lives
the
old
woman
raised
her
head
which
was
covered
with
tangled
locks
and
matted
hair
and
exclaimed
hey
no
hayes
lady
hayes
where
is
her
plantation
this
is
the
place
she
answered
i
m
widder
hayes
and
you
are
all
to
stay
here
we
could
not
believe
our
ears
or
eyes
but
after
putting
the
dirty
old
woman
through
a
severe
she
finally
produced
a
contract
signed
by
our
advertiser
agreeing
for
board
and
lodging
for
the
company
and
we
found
ourselves
booked
for
the
night
it
appeared
that
our
advertiser
could
find
no
better
quarters
in
that
forlorn
section
and
he
had
indulged
in
a
joke
at
our
expense
by
exciting
our
appetites
and
imaginations
in
anticipation
of
the
luxuries
we
should
find
in
the
magnificent
mansion
of
lady
joe
pentland
grumbled
bob
white
indulged
in
some
very
strong
language
and
signor
vivalla
laughed
he
had
travelled
with
his
monkey
and
organ
in
italy
and
could
put
up
with
any
fare
that
offered
i
took
the
disappointment
philosophically
simply
remarking
that
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
and
compensate
ourselves
when
we
reached
a
town
next
day
when
the
old
woman
called
us
to
dinner
we
crept
into
her
hut
and
found
that
she
had
improvised
benches
at
her
table
by
placing
boards
upon
the
only
four
chairs
in
her
possession
and
at
that
some
of
us
were
obliged
to
stand
the
dinner
consisted
of
a
piece
of
boiled
smoked
bacon
a
large
dish
of
greens
and
corn
bread
three
plates
two
knives
and
three
forks
made
up
the
entire
table
furniture
and
compelled
a
resort
to
our
a
short
horse
is
soon
curried
and
dinner
was
speedily
despatched
it
did
not
seem
possible
for
an
audience
to
assemble
in
that
forsaken
quarter
and
we
concluded
not
to
take
the
canvas
tent
out
of
the
wagon
by
three
o
clock
however
at
least
fifty
persons
had
arrived
on
the
ground
to
attend
the
night
show
and
they
reported
more
a
accordingly
we
put
up
the
tent
and
arranged
our
small
stage
and
curtains
preparing
seats
for
two
hundred
people
those
who
had
already
arrived
were
mostly
women
many
of
them
from
sixteen
to
twenty
years
old
poor
thin
creatures
wretchedly
clad
some
of
them
engaged
in
smoking
pipes
while
the
rest
were
chewing
snuff
this
latter
process
was
new
to
me
each
chewer
was
provided
with
a
short
stick
softened
at
one
end
by
chewing
it
and
this
stick
was
occasionally
dipped
into
a
snuff
box
and
then
stuck
into
the
mouth
from
whence
it
protruded
like
a
cigar
the
technical
term
for
the
proceeding
is
before
night
stragglers
had
brought
the
number
of
people
on
lady
hayes
plantation
up
to
one
hundred
and
soon
after
dark
we
opened
our
exhibition
to
an
audience
of
about
two
hundred
the
men
were
a
pale
haggard
set
of
uncombed
uncouth
creatures
whose
jaws
and
the
streams
of
colored
saliva
exuding
from
the
corners
of
their
mouths
indicated
that
they
were
confirmed
tobacco
chewers
i
never
saw
a
more
stupid
and
brutish
assemblage
of
human
beings
the
performance
delighted
them
pentland
s
tricks
astonished
them
and
led
them
to
declare
that
he
must
be
in
league
with
the
evil
one
signor
vivalla
s
and
plate
spinning
elicited
their
loudest
applause
and
bob
white
s
negro
songs
and
made
them
fairly
scream
with
laughter
at
last
the
performance
terminated
and
pentland
stepped
forward
and
delivered
the
closing
address
which
he
had
repeated
word
for
word
a
hundred
times
and
which
was
precisely
as
follows
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
entertainments
of
the
evening
have
now
come
to
a
conclusion
and
we
hope
to
your
general
but
now
came
a
dilemma
the
meaning
of
this
announcement
was
quite
above
the
comprehension
of
the
audience
they
had
not
the
remotest
idea
that
the
performance
was
finished
and
they
sat
like
statues
with
a
hearty
laugh
at
pentland
i
told
him
that
his
language
was
not
understood
in
this
locality
and
that
he
must
try
again
he
was
chagrined
and
declared
that
he
would
not
say
another
word
little
vivalla
laughed
danced
around
like
a
monkey
and
said
in
his
broken
english
ah
ha
signor
pentland
you
no
speak
good
eenglish
hah
these
educated
peoples
no
understand
you
eh
by
gar
what
d
d
fools
ah
signor
barnum
let
me
speaks
to
them
i
will
make
them
jump
double
i
quite
enjoyed
the
fun
and
said
well
signor
go
the
little
italian
jumped
upon
the
stage
and
with
a
broad
grimace
and
tremendous
gesture
exclaimed
eet
is
feenish
he
then
retired
behind
the
curtain
but
of
course
the
audience
did
not
understand
that
he
had
told
them
the
performance
was
finished
no
one
would
have
understood
him
hence
the
spectators
sat
still
wondering
what
would
come
next
by
gar
said
vivalla
losing
his
temper
i
will
give
them
a
hint
and
he
loosened
the
cord
and
down
fell
the
curtain
on
one
side
of
the
stage
good
good
cried
out
an
enthusiastic
poor
white
giving
his
quid
a
fresh
roll
to
the
other
side
of
his
mouth
now
we
are
going
to
have
something
i
reckon
they
s
totin
that
plunder
off
to
get
ready
for
a
dance
said
a
delicate
dipper
making
a
lunge
into
her
box
for
another
mouthful
of
the
dust
things
were
becoming
serious
and
i
saw
that
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
people
they
must
be
addressed
in
plain
language
so
walking
upon
the
stage
i
simply
said
making
at
the
same
time
a
motion
for
them
to
go
it
is
all
over
no
more
performance
the
show
is
this
was
understood
but
they
still
stood
upon
the
order
of
their
going
and
were
loth
to
leave
especially
as
the
to
them
extraordinary
announcements
of
pentland
and
vivalla
had
prepared
them
for
something
fresh
several
days
before
our
band
of
musicians
had
left
us
reducing
our
orchestra
to
an
organ
and
pipes
ground
and
blown
by
an
italian
whom
we
had
picked
up
on
the
road
we
had
in
addition
a
large
bass
drum
with
no
one
to
beat
it
and
this
drum
was
espied
by
some
of
the
audience
in
going
out
very
soon
i
was
waited
upon
by
a
masculine
committee
of
three
who
informed
me
that
the
young
ladies
were
very
anxious
to
hear
a
tune
on
the
big
pentland
heard
the
request
and
replied
i
will
accommodate
the
young
ladies
and
strapping
on
the
drum
he
took
a
stick
in
each
hand
and
began
to
pound
tremendously
occasionally
he
would
rap
the
sticks
together
toss
one
of
them
into
the
air
catching
it
as
it
came
down
and
then
pound
away
again
like
mad
in
fact
he
cut
up
all
sorts
of
pranks
with
that
big
drum
and
when
he
was
tired
out
and
stopped
he
was
gratified
at
being
told
by
the
young
ladies
that
they
had
never
heard
a
big
drum
before
but
he
played
it
splendid
and
they
thought
it
was
altogether
the
best
part
of
the
entire
performance
the
next
forenoon
we
arrived
at
macon
and
congratulated
ourselves
that
we
had
again
reached
the
regions
of
civilization
in
going
from
columbus
georgia
to
montgomery
alabama
we
were
obliged
to
cross
a
desolate
tract
known
as
the
indian
nation
and
as
several
persons
had
been
murdered
by
hostile
indians
in
that
region
it
was
deemed
dangerous
to
travel
the
road
without
an
escort
only
the
day
before
we
started
the
mail
stage
had
been
stopped
and
the
passengers
murdered
the
driver
alone
escaping
we
were
well
armed
however
and
trusted
that
our
numbers
would
present
too
formidable
a
force
to
be
attacked
though
we
dreaded
to
incur
the
risk
vivalla
alone
was
fearless
and
was
ready
to
encounter
fifty
indians
and
drive
them
into
the
swamp
accordingly
when
we
had
safely
passed
over
the
entire
route
to
within
fourteen
miles
of
montgomery
and
were
beyond
the
reach
of
danger
joe
pentland
determined
to
test
vivalla
s
bravery
he
had
secretly
purchased
at
mount
megs
on
the
way
an
old
indian
dress
with
a
fringed
hunting
shirt
and
moccasins
and
these
he
put
on
after
coloring
his
face
with
spanish
brown
then
shouldering
his
musket
he
followed
vivalla
and
the
party
and
approaching
stealthily
leaped
into
their
midst
with
a
tremendous
whoop
vivalla
s
companions
were
in
the
secret
and
they
instantly
fled
in
all
directions
vivalla
himself
ran
like
a
deer
and
pentland
after
him
gun
in
hand
and
yelling
horribly
after
running
a
full
mile
the
poor
little
italian
out
of
breath
and
frightened
nearly
to
death
dropped
on
his
knees
and
begged
for
his
life
the
indian
levelled
his
gun
at
his
victim
but
soon
seemed
to
relent
and
signified
that
vivalla
should
turn
his
pockets
inside
out
which
he
did
producing
and
handing
over
a
purse
containing
eleven
dollars
the
savage
then
marched
vivalla
to
an
oak
and
with
a
handkerchief
tied
him
in
the
most
approved
indian
manner
to
the
tree
leaving
him
half
dead
with
fright
pentland
then
joined
us
and
washing
his
face
and
changing
his
dress
we
all
went
to
the
relief
of
vivalla
he
was
overjoyed
to
see
us
and
when
he
was
released
his
courage
returned
he
swore
that
after
his
companions
left
him
the
indian
had
been
by
six
more
to
whom
in
default
of
a
gun
or
other
means
to
defend
himself
vivalla
had
been
compelled
to
surrender
we
pretended
to
believe
his
story
for
a
week
and
then
told
him
the
joke
which
he
refused
to
credit
and
also
declined
to
take
the
money
which
pentland
offered
to
return
as
it
could
not
possibly
be
his
since
seven
indians
had
taken
his
money
we
had
a
great
deal
of
fun
over
vivalla
s
courage
but
the
matter
made
him
so
cross
and
surly
that
we
were
finally
obliged
to
drop
it
altogether
from
that
time
forward
however
vivalla
never
boasted
of
his
prowess
we
arrived
at
montgomery
february
here
i
met
henry
hawley
a
legerdemain
performer
about
years
of
age
but
as
he
was
prematurely
gray
he
looked
at
least
seventy
and
i
sold
him
of
my
exhibition
he
had
a
ready
wit
a
happy
way
of
localizing
his
tricks
was
very
popular
in
that
part
of
the
country
where
he
had
been
performing
for
several
years
and
i
never
saw
him
nonplussed
but
once
this
was
when
he
was
performing
on
one
occasion
the
egg
and
bag
trick
which
he
did
with
his
usual
success
producing
egg
after
egg
from
the
bag
and
illustration
coward
and
the
finally
breaking
one
to
show
that
they
were
genuine
now
said
hawley
i
will
show
you
the
old
hen
that
laid
it
happened
however
that
the
negro
boy
to
whom
had
been
intrusted
the
duty
of
supplying
the
bag
had
made
a
slight
mistake
which
was
manifest
when
hawley
triumphantly
produced
not
the
old
hen
that
laid
the
eggs
but
a
rooster
the
whole
audience
was
convulsed
with
laughter
and
the
abashed
hawley
retreated
to
the
dressing
room
cursing
the
stupidity
of
the
black
boy
who
had
been
paid
to
put
a
hen
in
the
bag
after
performing
in
different
places
in
alabama
kentucky
and
tennessee
we
disbanded
at
nashville
in
may
vivalla
going
to
new
york
where
he
performed
on
his
own
account
for
a
while
previous
to
sailing
for
cuba
hawley
staying
in
tennessee
to
look
after
our
horses
which
had
been
turned
out
to
grass
and
i
returning
home
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
my
family
early
in
july
returning
west
with
a
new
company
of
performers
i
rejoined
hawley
and
we
began
our
campaign
in
kentucky
we
were
not
successful
one
of
our
small
company
was
incompetent
another
was
intemperate
both
were
dismissed
and
our
was
drowned
in
the
river
at
frankfort
funds
were
low
and
i
was
obliged
to
leave
pledges
here
and
there
in
payment
for
bills
which
i
afterwards
redeemed
hawley
and
i
dissolved
in
august
and
making
a
new
partnership
with
graves
i
left
him
in
charge
of
the
establishment
and
went
to
tiffin
ohio
where
i
joe
pentland
buying
his
horses
and
wagons
and
taking
him
with
several
musicians
to
kentucky
during
my
short
stay
at
tiffin
a
religious
conversation
at
the
hotel
introduced
me
to
several
gentlemen
who
requested
me
to
lecture
on
the
subjects
we
had
discussed
and
i
did
so
to
a
crowded
audience
in
the
sunday
afternoon
and
evening
at
the
solicitation
of
a
gentleman
from
republic
i
also
delivered
two
lectures
in
that
town
on
the
evenings
of
september
and
on
our
way
to
kentucky
just
before
we
reached
cincinnati
we
met
a
drove
of
hogs
and
one
of
the
drivers
making
an
insolent
remark
because
our
wagons
interfered
with
his
swine
i
replied
in
the
same
vein
when
he
dismounted
and
pointing
a
pistol
at
my
breast
swore
he
would
shoot
me
if
i
did
not
apologize
i
begged
him
to
permit
me
to
consult
with
a
friend
in
the
next
wagon
and
the
misunderstanding
should
be
satisfactorily
settled
my
friend
was
a
loaded
gun
which
i
pointed
at
him
and
said
now
sir
must
apologize
for
your
brains
are
in
danger
you
drew
a
weapon
upon
me
for
a
trivial
remark
you
seem
to
hold
human
life
at
a
cheap
price
and
now
sir
you
have
the
choice
between
a
load
of
shot
and
an
this
led
to
an
apology
and
a
friendly
conversation
in
which
we
both
agreed
that
many
a
life
is
sacrificed
in
sudden
anger
because
one
or
both
of
the
contending
parties
carry
deadly
weapons
in
our
subsequent
southern
tour
we
exhibited
at
nashville
where
i
visited
general
jackson
at
the
hermitage
huntsville
tuscaloosa
vicksburg
and
intermediate
places
doing
tolerably
well
at
vicksburg
we
sold
all
our
land
conveyances
excepting
the
band
wagon
and
four
horses
bought
the
steamboat
ceres
for
six
thousand
dollars
hired
the
captain
and
crew
and
started
down
the
river
to
exhibit
at
places
on
the
way
at
natchez
our
cook
left
us
and
in
the
search
for
another
i
found
a
white
widow
who
would
go
only
she
expected
to
marry
a
painter
i
called
on
the
painter
who
had
not
made
up
his
mind
whether
to
marry
the
widow
or
not
but
i
told
him
if
he
would
marry
her
the
next
morning
i
would
hire
her
at
dollars
a
month
as
cook
employ
him
at
the
same
wages
as
painter
with
board
for
both
and
a
cash
bonus
of
fifty
dollars
there
was
a
wedding
on
board
the
next
day
and
we
had
a
good
cook
and
a
good
dinner
during
one
of
our
evening
performances
at
francisville
louisiana
a
man
tried
to
pass
me
at
the
door
of
the
tent
claiming
that
he
had
paid
for
admittance
i
refused
him
entrance
and
as
he
was
slightly
intoxicated
he
struck
me
with
a
slung
shot
mashing
my
hat
and
grazing
what
phrenologists
call
the
organ
of
he
went
away
and
soon
returned
with
a
gang
of
armed
and
companions
who
ordered
us
to
pack
up
our
traps
and
plunder
and
to
get
on
board
our
steamboat
within
an
hour
the
big
tent
speedily
came
down
no
one
was
permitted
to
help
us
but
the
company
worked
with
a
will
and
within
five
minutes
of
the
expiration
of
the
hour
we
were
on
board
and
ready
to
leave
the
scamps
who
had
caused
our
departure
escorted
us
and
our
last
load
waving
pine
torches
and
saluted
us
with
a
hurrah
as
we
swung
into
the
stream
the
new
orleans
papers
of

announced
the

of

the
train
laid
smashing
a
rival
company
i
have
said
that
the
show
business
has
as
many
grades
of
dignity
as
trade
which
ranges
all
the
way
from
the
mammoth
wholesale
establishment
down
to
the
corner
stand
the
itinerant
amusement
business
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
i
had
begun
there
but
i
had
no
wish
to
stay
there
in
fact
i
was
thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
trade
of
a
travelling
showman
and
although
i
felt
that
i
could
succeed
in
that
line
yet
i
always
regarded
it
not
as
an
end
but
as
a
means
to
something
better
longing
now
for
some
permanent
respectable
business
i
advertised
for
a
partner
stating
that
i
had
to
invest
and
would
add
my
unremitting
personal
attention
to
the
capital
and
the
business
this
advertisement
gave
me
an
altogether
new
insight
into
human
nature
whoever
wishes
to
know
how
some
people
live
or
want
to
live
let
him
advertise
for
a
partner
at
the
same
time
stating
that
he
has
a
large
or
small
capital
to
invest
i
was
flooded
with
answers
to
my
advertisements
and
received
no
less
than
different
propositions
for
the
use
of
my
capital
of
these
at
least
were
from
keepers
brokers
pawnbrokers
dealers
patent
medicine
men
inventors
and
others
also
made
application
some
of
my
correspondents
declined
to
specifically
state
the
nature
of
their
business
but
they
promised
to
open
the
door
to
untold
wealth
i
had
interviews
with
some
of
these
mysterious
one
of
them
was
a
counterfeiter
who
after
much
hesitation
and
pledges
of
secrecy
showed
me
some
counterfeit
coin
and
bank
notes
he
wanted
to
purchase
paper
and
ink
and
to
prepare
new
dies
and
he
actually
proposed
that
i
should
join
him
in
the
business
which
promised
he
declared
a
safe
and
rich
harvest
another
sedate
individual
dressed
in
quaker
costume
wanted
me
to
join
him
in
an
oat
speculation
by
buying
a
horse
and
wagon
and
by
selling
oats
bought
at
wholesale
in
bags
he
thought
a
good
business
could
be
done
especially
as
people
would
not
be
particular
to
measure
after
a
quaker
do
you
mean
to
cheat
in
measuring
your
oats
i
asked
o
i
should
probably
make
them
hold
out
he
answered
with
a
leer
one
application
came
from
a
pearl
street
wool
merchant
who
failed
a
month
afterwards
then
came
a
perpetual
motion
man
who
had
a
machine
in
which
i
discovered
a
slyly
hid
in
a
hollow
post
the
spring
making
perpetual
motion
till
it
ran
down
finally
i
went
into
partnership
with
a
german
named
proler
who
was
a
manufacturer
of
paste
for
leather
cologne
water
and
bear
s
grease
we
took
the
store
no
bowery
at
a
rent
including
the
dwelling
of
per
annum
and
opened
a
large
manufactory
of
the
above
articles
proler
manufactured
and
sold
the
goods
at
wholesale
in
boston
charleston
cleveland
and
various
other
parts
of
the
country
i
kept
the
accounts
and
attended
to
sales
in
the
store
wholesale
and
retail
for
a
while
the
business
seemed
to
prosper
at
least
till
my
capital
was
absorbed
and
notes
for
stock
began
to
fall
due
with
nothing
to
meet
them
since
we
had
sold
our
goods
on
long
credits
in
january
i
dissolved
partnership
with
proler
he
buying
the
entire
interest
for
on
credit
and
then
running
away
to
rotterdam
without
paying
his
note
and
leaving
me
nothing
but
a
few
recipes
proler
was
a
plausible
promising
scamp
during
my
connection
with
proler
i
became
acquainted
with
a
remarkable
young
dancer
named
john
diamond
he
was
one
of
the
first
and
best
of
the
numerous
negro
and
dancers
who
have
since
surprised
and
amused
the
public
and
i
entered
into
an
engagement
with
his
father
for
his
services
putting
diamond
in
the
hands
of
an
agent
as
i
did
not
wish
to
appear
in
the
transaction
in
the
spring
of
i
hired
and
opened
the
vauxhall
garden
saloon
in
new
york
and
gave
a
variety
of
performances
including
singing
dancing
yankee
stories
etc
in
this
saloon
miss
mary
taylor
afterwards
so
celebrated
as
an
actress
and
singer
made
her
first
appearance
on
the
stage
the
enterprise
however
did
not
meet
my
expectation
and
i
relinquished
it
in
august
what
was
to
be
done
next
i
dreaded
resuming
the
life
of
an
itinerant
showman
but
funds
were
low
i
had
a
family
to
care
for
and
as
nothing
better
presented
i
made
up
my
mind
to
endure
the
vexations
and
uncertainties
of
a
tour
in
the
west
and
south
i
collected
a
company
consisting
of
jenkins
an
excellent
singer
and
delineator
of
yankee
and
other
characters
master
john
diamond
the
dancer
francis
lynch
an
orphan
vagabond
fourteen
years
old
whom
i
picked
up
at
troy
and
a
fiddler
my
john
hallett
preceded
us
as
agent
and
advertiser
and
our
route
passed
through
buffalo
toronto
detroit
chicago
ottawa
springfield
the
intermediate
places
and
louis
where
i
took
the
steamboat
for
new
orleans
with
a
company
reduced
by
desertions
to
master
diamond
and
the
fiddler
arriving
in
new
orleans
january
i
had
but
in
my
purse
and
i
had
started
from
new
york
four
months
before
with
quite
as
much
in
my
pocket
excepting
some
small
remittances
to
my
family
i
had
made
nothing
more
than
current
expenses
and
when
i
had
been
in
new
orleans
a
fortnight
funds
were
so
low
that
i
was
obliged
to
pledge
my
watch
as
security
for
my
board
bill
but
on
the
i
received
from
the
charles
theatre
as
my
half
share
of
diamond
s
benefit
the
next
night
i
had
and
the
third
night
was
my
share
of
the
proceeds
of
a
grand
dancing
match
at
the
theatre
between
diamond
and
a
negro
dancer
from
kentucky
subsequent
engagements
at
vicksburg
and
jackson
were
not
so
successful
but
returning
to
new
orleans
we
again
succeeded
admirably
and
afterwards
at
mobile
diamond
however
after
extorting
considerable
sums
of
money
from
me
finally
ran
away
and
march
i
started
homeward
by
way
of
the
mississippi
and
the
ohio
while
i
was
in
new
orleans
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
that
genial
man
tyrone
power
who
was
just
concluding
an
engagement
at
the
charles
theatre
in
bidding
me
farewell
he
wished
me
every
success
and
hoped
we
should
meet
again
alas
poor
power
all
the
world
knows
how
he
set
sail
from
our
shores
and
he
and
his
ship
were
never
seen
again
fanny
ellsler
was
also
in
new
orleans
and
when
i
saw
seats
in
the
dress
circle
sold
at
an
average
of
four
dollars
and
i
gave
her
agent
chevalier
henry
wyckoff
great
credit
for
exciting
public
enthusiasm
to
the
highest
pitch
and
i
thought
the
prices
enormous
i
did
not
dream
then
that
within
twelve
years
i
should
be
selling
tickets
in
the
same
city
for
full
five
times
that
sum
at
pittsburg
where
i
arrived
march
i
learned
that
jenkins
who
had
enticed
francis
lynch
away
from
me
at
louis
was
exhibiting
him
at
the
museum
under
the
name
of
master
diamond
and
visiting
the
performance
the
next
day
i
wrote
jenkins
an
ironical
review
for
which
he
threatened
suit
and
he
actually
instigated
lindsay
from
whom
i
hired
joice
heth
in
philadelphia
in
and
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
though
he
was
then
residing
in
pittsburg
to
sue
me
for
a
pipe
of
brandy
which
it
was
pretended
was
promised
in
addition
to
the
money
paid
him
i
was
required
to
give
bonds
of
which
as
i
was
among
strangers
i
could
not
immediately
procure
and
i
was
accordingly
thrown
into
jail
till
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
i
was
liberated
the
next
day
i
caused
the
arrest
of
jenkins
for
trespass
in
assuming
master
diamond
s
name
and
reputation
for
master
lynch
and
he
was
sent
to
jail
till
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
each
having
had
his
turn
at
this
amusement
we
adjourned
our
controversy
to
new
york
where
i
beat
him
as
for
lindsay
i
heard
nothing
more
of
his
claim
or
him
till
twelve
years
afterwards
when
he
called
on
me
in
boston
with
an
apology
he
was
very
poor
and
i
was
highly
prosperous
and
i
may
add
that
lindsay
did
not
lack
a
friend
i
arrived
in
new
york
april
after
an
absence
of
eight
months
finding
my
family
in
good
health
i
resolved
once
more
that
i
would
never
again
be
an
itinerant
showman
three
days
afterwards
i
contracted
with
robert
sears
the
publisher
for
five
hundred
copies
of
sears
pictorial
illustrations
of
the
bible
at
and
accepting
the
united
states
agency
i
opened
an
office
may
at
the
corner
of
beekman
and
nassau
streets
the
site
of
the
present
nassau
bank
i
had
had
a
limited
experience
with
that
book
in
this
way
when
i
was
in
pittsburg
an
acquaintance
harker
was
complaining
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
when
i
picked
up
a
new
york
paper
and
saw
the
advertisement
of
sears
s
pictorial
illustrations
of
the
bible
price
a
harker
thought
he
could
get
subscribers
and
i
bought
him
a
specimen
copy
agreeing
to
furnish
him
with
as
many
as
he
wanted
at
a
copy
though
i
had
never
before
seen
the
work
and
did
not
know
the
wholesale
price
the
result
was
that
he
obtained
eighty
subscribers
in
two
days
and
made
my
own
venture
in
the
work
was
not
so
successful
i
advertised
largely
had
plenty
of
agents
and
in
six
months
sold
thousands
of
copies
but
irresponsible
agents
used
up
all
my
profits
and
my
capital
while
engaged
in
this
business
i
once
more
leased
vauxhall
saloon
opening
it
june
employing
john
hallett
my
as
manager
under
my
direction
and
at
the
close
of
the
season
september
we
had
cleared
about
two
hundred
dollars
this
sum
was
soon
exhausted
and
with
my
family
on
my
hands
and
no
employment
i
was
glad
to
do
anything
that
would
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
i
wrote
advertisements
and
notices
for
the
bowery
amphitheatre
receiving
for
the
service
four
dollars
a
week
which
i
was
very
glad
to
get
and
i
also
wrote
articles
for
the
sunday
papers
deriving
a
fair
remuneration
and
managing
to
get
a
living
but
i
was
at
the
bottom
round
of
fortune
s
ladder
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
effort
which
would
raise
me
above
want
i
was
specially
stimulated
to
this
effort
by
a
letter
which
i
received
about
this
time
from
my
esteemed
friend
hon
thomas
whittlesey
of
danbury
he
held
a
mortgage
of
five
hundred
dollars
on
a
piece
of
property
i
owned
in
that
place
and
as
he
was
convinced
that
i
would
never
lay
up
anything
he
wrote
me
that
i
might
as
well
pay
him
then
as
ever
this
letter
made
me
resolve
to
live
no
longer
from
hand
to
mouth
but
to
concentrate
my
energies
upon
laying
up
something
for
the
future
while
i
was
forming
this
practical
determination
i
was
much
nearer
to
its
realization
than
my
most
sanguine
hopes
could
have
predicted
the
road
to
fortune
was
close
by
without
suspecting
it
i
was
about
to
enter
upon
an
enterprise
which
while
giving
full
scope
for
whatever
tact
industry
and
pluck
i
might
possess
was
to
take
me
from
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
place
me
many
rounds
above
as
outside
clerk
for
the
bowery
amphitheatre
i
had
casually
learned
that
the
collection
of
curiosities
comprising
scudder
s
american
museum
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
ann
street
was
for
sale
it
belonged
to
the
daughters
of
scudder
and
was
conducted
for
their
benefit
by
john
furzman
under
the
authority
of
john
heath
administrator
the
price
asked
for
the
entire
collection
was
fifteen
thousand
dollars
it
had
cost
its
founder
scudder
probably
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
from
the
profits
of
the
establishment
he
had
been
able
to
leave
a
large
competency
to
his
children
the
museum
however
had
been
for
several
years
a
losing
concern
and
the
heirs
were
anxious
to
sell
it
looking
at
this
property
i
thought
i
saw
that
energy
tact
and
liberality
were
only
needed
to
make
it
a
paying
institution
and
i
determined
to
purchase
it
if
possible
you
buy
the
american
museum
said
a
friend
who
knew
the
state
of
my
funds
what
do
you
intend
buying
it
with
brass
i
replied
for
silver
and
gold
have
i
the
museum
building
belonged
to
francis
olmsted
a
retired
merchant
to
whom
i
wrote
stating
my
desire
to
buy
the
collection
and
that
although
i
had
no
means
if
it
could
be
purchased
upon
reasonable
credit
i
was
confident
that
my
tact
and
experience
added
to
a
determined
devotion
to
business
would
enable
me
to
make
the
payments
when
due
i
therefore
asked
him
to
purchase
the
collection
in
his
own
name
to
give
me
a
writing
securing
it
to
me
provided
i
made
the
payments
punctually
including
the
rent
of
his
building
to
allow
me
twelve
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
on
which
to
support
my
family
and
if
at
any
time
i
failed
to
meet
the
instalment
due
i
would
vacate
the
premises
and
forfeit
all
that
might
have
been
paid
to
that
date
in
fact
olmsted
i
continued
in
my
earnestness
you
may
bind
me
in
any
way
and
as
tightly
as
you
please
only
give
me
a
chance
to
dig
out
or
scratch
out
and
i
will
do
so
or
forfeit
all
the
labor
and
trouble
i
may
have
in
reply
to
this
letter
which
i
took
to
his
house
myself
he
named
an
hour
when
i
could
call
on
him
and
as
i
was
there
at
the
exact
moment
he
expressed
himself
pleased
with
my
punctuality
he
inquired
closely
as
to
my
habits
and
antecedents
and
i
frankly
narrated
my
experiences
as
a
caterer
for
the
public
mentioning
my
amusement
ventures
in
vauxhall
garden
the
circus
and
in
the
exhibitions
i
had
managed
at
the
south
and
west
who
are
your
references
he
inquired
any
man
in
my
line
i
replied
from
edmund
simpson
manager
of
the
park
theatre
or
william
niblo
to
welch
june
titus
turner
angevine
or
other
circus
or
menagerie
proprietors
also
moses
y
beach
of
the
new
york
can
you
get
any
of
them
to
call
on
me
he
continued
i
told
him
that
i
could
and
the
next
day
my
friend
niblo
rode
down
and
had
an
interview
with
olmsted
while
beach
and
several
other
gentlemen
also
called
and
the
following
morning
i
waited
upon
him
for
his
decision
i
don
t
like
your
references
barnum
said
olmsted
abruptly
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
room
i
was
confused
and
said
i
regretted
to
hear
they
all
speak
too
well
of
you
he
added
laughing
in
fact
they
all
talk
as
if
they
were
partners
of
yours
and
intended
to
share
the
nothing
could
have
pleased
me
better
he
then
asked
me
what
security
i
could
offer
in
case
he
concluded
to
make
the
purchase
for
me
and
it
was
finally
agreed
that
if
he
should
do
so
he
should
retain
the
property
till
it
was
entirely
paid
for
and
should
also
appoint
a
and
accountant
at
my
expense
who
should
render
him
a
weekly
statement
i
was
further
to
take
an
apartment
hitherto
used
as
a
billiard
room
in
an
adjoining
building
allowing
therefor
a
year
making
a
total
rent
of
per
annum
on
a
lease
of
ten
years
he
then
told
me
to
see
the
administrator
and
heirs
of
the
estate
to
get
their
best
terms
and
to
meet
him
on
his
return
to
town
a
week
from
that
time
i
at
once
saw
john
heath
the
administrator
and
his
price
was
i
offered
payable
in
seven
annual
instalments
with
good
security
after
several
interviews
it
was
finally
agreed
that
i
should
have
it
for
payable
as
above
possession
to
be
given
on
the
november
olmsted
assented
to
this
and
a
morning
was
appointed
to
draw
and
sign
the
writings
heath
appeared
but
said
he
must
decline
proceeding
any
farther
in
my
case
as
he
had
sold
the
collection
to
the
directors
of
peale
s
museum
an
incorporated
institution
for
and
had
received
in
advance
i
was
shocked
and
appealed
to
heath
s
honor
he
said
that
he
had
signed
no
writing
with
me
was
in
no
way
legally
bound
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
the
heirs
olmsted
was
sorry
but
could
not
help
me
the
new
tenants
would
not
require
him
to
incur
any
risk
and
my
matter
was
at
an
end
of
course
i
immediately
informed
myself
as
to
the
character
of
peale
s
museum
company
it
proved
to
be
a
band
of
speculators
who
had
bought
peale
s
collection
for
a
few
thousand
dollars
expecting
to
join
the
american
museum
with
it
issue
and
sell
stock
to
the
amount
of
pocket
profits
and
permit
the
stockholders
to
look
out
for
themselves
i
went
immediately
to
several
of
the
editors
including
major
noah
y
beach
my
good
friends
west
herrick
and
ropes
of
the
and
others
and
stated
my
grievances
now
said
i
if
you
will
grant
me
the
use
of
your
columns
i
ll
blow
that
speculation
they
all
consented
and
i
wrote
a
large
number
of
squibs
cautioning
the
public
against
buying
the
museum
stock
ridiculing
the
idea
of
a
board
of
bank
directors
engaging
in
the
exhibition
of
stuffed
monkey
and
gander
skins
appealing
to
the
case
of
the
zoÃ¶logical
institute
which
had
failed
by
adopting
such
a
plan
as
the
one
now
proposed
and
finally
i
told
the
public
that
such
a
speculation
would
be
infinitely
more

and

the
stock
was
as
dead
as

i
then
went
to
heath
and
asked
him
when
the
directors
were
to
pay
the
other
on
the
day
of
december
or
forfeit
the
already
paid
was
the
reply
i
assured
him
that
they
would
never
pay
it
that
they
could
not
raise
it
and
that
he
would
ultimately
find
himself
with
the
museum
collection
on
his
hands
and
if
once
i
started
off
with
an
exhibition
for
the
south
i
would
not
touch
the
museum
at
price
now
said
i
if
you
will
agree
with
me
confidentially
that
in
case
these
gentlemen
do
not
pay
you
on
the
of
december
i
may
have
it
on
the
for
i
will
run
the
risk
and
wait
in
this
city
until
that
he
readily
agreed
to
the
proposition
but
said
he
was
sure
they
would
not
forfeit
their
very
well
said
i
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
this
arrangement
shall
not
be
he
assented
on
the
day
of
december
at
ten
o
clock
i
wish
you
to
meet
me
in
olmsted
s
apartments
prepared
to
sign
the
writings
provided
this
incorporated
company
do
not
pay
you
on
the
he
agreed
to
this
and
by
my
request
put
it
in
writing
from
that
moment
i
felt
that
the
museum
was
mine
i
saw
olmsted
and
told
him
so
he
promised
secrecy
and
agreed
to
sign
the
documents
if
the
other
parties
did
not
meet
their
engagement
this
was
about
november
and
i
continued
my
shower
of

at
the

which
could
not
sell
a

of
its
stock
meanwhile
if
any

spoke
to

one
morning
about

of

i
received
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
that
company
now
calling
itself
the
new
york
museum
company
requesting
me
to
meet
the
directors
at
the
museum
on
the
following
monday
morning
i
went
and
found
the
directors
in
session
the
venerable
president
of
the
board
who
was
also
the
of
a
broken
bank
blandly
proposed
to
hire
me
to
manage
the
united
museums
and
though
i
saw
that
he
merely
meant
to
buy
my
silence
i
professed
to
entertain
the
proposition
and
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
as
to
what
salary
i
should
expect
i
specified
the
sum
of
a
year
this
was
at
once
acceded
to
the
salary
to
begin
january
and
after
complimenting
me
on
my
ability
the
president
remarked
of
course
barnum
we
shall
have
no
more
of
your
squibs
through
the
newspapers
to
which
i
replied
that
i
should
ever
try
to
serve
the
interests
of
my
employers
and
i
took
my
leave
it
was
as
clear
to
me
as
noonday
that
after
buying
my
silence
so
as
to
appreciate
their
stock
these
directors
meant
to
sell
out
to
whom
they
could
leaving
me
to
look
to
future
stockholders
for
my
salary
they
thought
no
doubt
that
they
had
nicely
entrapped
me
but
i
knew
i
had
caught
them
for
supposing
me
to
be
out
of
the
way
and
having
no
other
rival
purchaser
these
directors
postponed
the
advertisement
of
their
stock
to
give
people
time
to
forget
the
attacks
i
had
made
on
it
and
they
also
took
their
own
time
for
paying
the
money
promised
to
heath
december
indeed
they
did
not
even
call
on
him
at
the
appointed
time
but
on
the
following
morning
as
agreed
i
was
promptly
and
hopefully
at
olmstead
s
apartments
with
my
legal
adviser
at
nine
o
clock
heath
came
with
his
lawyer
at
ten
and
before
two
o
clock
that
day
i
was
in
formal
possession
of
the
american
museum
my
first
managerial
act
was
to
write
and
despatch
the
following
complimentary
note
american
museum
new
york
the
president
and
directors
of
the
new
york
museum
gentlemen
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
you
are
placed
upon
the
free
list
of
this
establishment
until
further
notice
barnum
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
president
of
the
new
york
museum
was
astounded
and
when
he
called
upon
heath
and
learned
that
i
had
bought
and
was
really
in
possession
of
the
american
museum
he
was
indignant
he
talked
of
prosecution
and
demanded
the
paid
on
his
agreement
but
he
did
not
prosecute
and
he
justly
forfeited
his
deposit
money
and
now
that
i
was
proprietor
and
manager
of
the
american
museum
i
had
reached
a
new
epoch
in
my
career
which
i
felt
was
the
beginning
of
better
days
though
the
full
significance
of
this
important
step
i
did
not
see
i
was
still
in
the
show
business
but
in
a
settled
substantial
phase
of
it
that
invited
industry
and
enterprise
and
called
for
ever
earnest
and
ever
heroic
endeavor
whether
i
should
sink
or
swim
depended
wholly
upon
my
own
energy
i
must
pay
for
the
establishment
within
a
stipulated
time
or
forfeit
it
with
whatever
i
had
paid
on
account
i
meant
to
make
it
my
own
and
brains
hands
and
every
effort
were
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
museum
the
nucleus
of
this
establishment
scudder
s
museum
was
formed
in
the
year
in
which
i
was
born
it
was
begun
in
chatham
street
and
was
afterwards
transferred
to
the
old
city
hall
and
from
small
beginnings
by
purchases
and
to
a
considerable
degree
by
presents
it
had
grown
to
be
a
large
and
valuable
collection
people
in
all
parts
of
the
country
had
sent
in
relics
and
rare
curiosities
sea
captains
for
years
had
brought
and
deposited
strange
things
from
foreign
lands
and
besides
all
these
gifts
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
previous
proprietor
had
actually
expended
as
was
stated
in
making
the
collection
no
one
could
go
through
the
halls
as
they
were
when
they
came
under
my
proprietorship
and
see
there
was
worth
seeing
in
a
single
day
and
then
as
i
always
justly
boasted
afterwards
no
one
could
visit
my
museum
and
go
away
without
feeling
that
he
had
received
the
full
worth
of
his
money
in
looking
over
the
immense
collection
the
accumulation
of
so
many
years
i
saw
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
properly
present
its
merits
to
the
public
to
make
it
the
most
attractive
and
popular
place
of
resort
and
entertainment
in
the
united
states
valuable
as
the
collection
was
when
i
bought
it
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
american
museum
as
i
made
it
in
my
long
proprietorship
i
considerably
more
than
doubled
the
permanent
attractions
and
curiosities
of
the
establishment
in
i
bought
and
added
to
my
collection
the
entire
contents
of
peale
s
museum
in
i
purchased
the
large
peale
collection
in
philadelphia
and
year
after
year
i
bought
genuine
curiosities
regardless
of
cost
wherever
i
could
find
them
in
europe
or
america
at
the
very
outset
i
was
determined
to
deserve
success
my
plan
of
economy
included
the
intention
to
support
my
family
in
new
york
on
a
year
and
my
treasure
of
a
wife
not
only
gladly
assented
but
was
willing
to
reduce
the
sum
to
if
necessary
some
six
months
after
i
had
bought
the
museum
olmsted
happened
in
at
my
at
noon
and
found
me
eating
a
frugal
dinner
of
cold
corned
beef
and
bread
which
i
had
brought
from
home
is
this
the
way
you
eat
your
dinner
he
asked
i
have
not
eaten
a
warm
dinner
except
on
sundays
i
replied
since
i
bought
the
museum
and
i
never
intend
to
on
a
week
day
till
i
am
out
of
ah
said
he
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
you
are
safe
and
will
pay
for
the
museum
before
the
year
is
and
he
was
right
for
within
twelve
months
i
was
in
full
possession
of
the
property
as
my
own
and
it
was
entirely
paid
for
from
the
profits
of
the
business
in
the
space
occupied
for
my
museum
purposes
was
more
than
double
what
it
was
in
the
lecture
room
originally
narrow
and
inconvenient
was
so
enlarged
and
improved
that
it
became
one
of
the
most
commodious
and
beautiful
amusement
halls
in
the
city
of
new
york
at
first
my
attractions
and
inducements
were
merely
the
collection
of
curiosities
by
day
and
an
evening
entertainment
consisting
of
such
variety
performances
as
were
current
in
ordinary
shows
then
saturday
afternoons
and
soon
afterwards
wednesday
afternoons
were
devoted
to
entertainments
and
the
popularity
of
the
museum
grew
so
rapidly
that
i
presently
found
it
expedient
and
profitable
to
open
the
great
lecture
room
every
afternoon
as
well
as
every
evening
on
every
in
the
year
the
first
experiments
in
this
direction
more
than
justified
my
expectations
for
the
day
exhibitions
were
always
more
thronged
than
those
of
the
evening
of
course
i
made
the
most
of
the
holidays
advertising
extensively
and
presenting
extra
inducements
nor
did
attractions
elsewhere
seem
to
keep
the
crowd
from
coming
to
the
museum
on
great
holidays
i
gave
as
many
as
twelve
performances
to
as
many
different
audiences
by
degrees
the
character
of
the
stage
performances
was
changed
the
transient
attractions
of
the
museum
were
constantly
diversified

these
among
others
were
all
exceedingly
successful
i
thoroughly
understood
the
art
of
advertising
not
merely
by
means
of
printer
s
ink
which
i
have
always
used
freely
and
to
which
i
confess
myself
so
much
indebted
for
my
success
but
by
turning
every
possible
circumstance
to
my
account
it
was
my
monomania
to
make
the
museum
the
town
wonder
and
town
talk
i
often
seized
upon
an
opportunity
by
instinct
even
before
i
had
a
very
definite
conception
as
to
how
it
should
be
used
and
it
seemed
somehow
to
mature
itself
and
serve
my
purpose
as
an
illustration
one
morning
a
stout
man
came
into
my
and
begged
some
money
i
asked
him
why
he
did
not
work
and
earn
his
living
he
replied
that
he
could
get
nothing
to
do
and
that
he
would
be
glad
of
any
job
at
a
dollar
a
day
i
handed
him
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
told
him
to
go
and
get
his
breakfast
and
return
and
i
would
employ
him
at
light
labor
at
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
day
when
he
returned
i
gave
him
five
common
bricks
now
said
i
go
and
lay
a
brick
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
ann
street
another
close
by
the
museum
a
third
diagonally
across
the
way
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
vesey
street
by
the
astor
house
put
down
the
fourth
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
st
paul
s
church
opposite
then
with
the
fifth
brick
in
hand
take
up
a
rapid
march
from
one
point
to
the
other
making
the
circuit
exchanging
your
brick
at
every
point
and
say
nothing
to
any
what
is
the
object
of
this
inquired
the
man
no
matter
i
replied
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
it
brings
you
fifteen
cents
wages
per
hour
it
is
a
bit
of
my
fun
and
to
assist
me
properly
you
must
seem
to
be
as
deaf
as
a
post
wear
a
serious
countenance
answer
no
questions
pay
no
attention
to
any
one
but
attend
faithfully
to
the
work
and
at
the
end
of
every
hour
by
paul
s
clock
show
this
ticket
at
the
museum
door
enter
walking
solemnly
through
every
hall
in
the
building
pass
out
and
resumÃ©
your
with
the
remark
that
it
was
all
one
to
him
so
long
as
he
could
earn
his
living
the
man
placed
his
bricks
and
began
his
round
half
an
hour
afterwards
at
least
five
hundred
people
were
watching
his
mysterious
movements
he
had
assumed
a
military
step
and
bearing
and
looking
as
sober
as
a
judge
he
made
no
response
whatever
to
the
constant
inquiries
as
to
the
object
of
his
singular
conduct
at
the
end
of
the
first
hour
the
sidewalks
in
the
vicinity
were
packed
with
people
all
anxious
to
solve
the
mystery
the
man
as
directed
then
went
into
the
museum
devoting
fifteen
minutes
to
a
solemn
survey
of
the
halls
and
afterwards
returning
to
his
round
this
was
repeated
every
hour
till
sundown
and
whenever
the
man
went
into
the
museum
a
dozen
or
more
persons
would
buy
tickets
and
follow
him
hoping
to
gratify
their
curiosity
in
regard
to
the
purpose
of
his
movements
this
was
continued
for
several
days
the
curious
people
who
followed
the
man
into
the
museum
considerably
more
than
paying
his
wages
till
finally
the
policeman
to
whom
i
had
imparted
my
object
complained
that
the
obstruction
of
the
sidewalk
by
crowds
had
become
so
serious
that
i
must
call
in
my
brick
this
trivial
incident
excited
considerable
talk
and
amusement
it
advertised
me
and
it
materially
advanced
my
purpose
of
making
a
lively
corner
near
the
museum
i
am
tempted
to
relate
some
of
the
incidents
and
anecdotes
which
attended
my
career
as
owner
and
manager
of
the
museum
the
stories
illustrating
merely
my
introduction
of
novelties
would
more
than
fill
this
book
but
i
must
make
room
for
a
few
of
them
an
actor
named
la
rue
presented
himself
as
an
imitator
of
celebrated
histrionic
personages
including
macready
forrest
kemble
the
elder
booth
kean
hamblin
and
others
taking
him
into
the
for
a
private
rehearsal
and
finding
his
imitations
excellent
i
engaged
him
for
three
nights
he
gave
great
satisfaction
but
early
in
the
fourth
evening
he
staggered
into
the
museum
so
drunk
that
he
could
hardly
stand
and
in
half
an
hour
he
must
be
on
the
stage
calling
an
assistant
we
took
la
rue
between
us
and
marched
him
up
broadway
as
far
as
chambers
street
and
back
to
the
lower
end
of
the
park
hoping
to
sober
him
at
this
point
we
put
his
head
under
a
pump
and
gave
him
a
good
ducking
with
visible
beneficial
effect
then
a
walk
around
the
park
and
another
ducking
when
he
assured
me
that
he
should
be
able
to
give
his
imitations
to
a
you
drunken
brute
said
i
if
you
fail
and
disappoint
my
audience
i
will
throw
you
out
of
the
he
declared
that
he
was
all
right
and
i
led
him
behind
the
scenes
where
i
waited
with
considerable
trepidation
to
watch
his
movements
on
the
stage
he
began
by
saying
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
will
now
give
you
an
imitation
of
booth
the
eminent
his
tongue
was
thick
his
language
somewhat
incoherent
and
i
had
great
misgivings
as
he
proceeded
but
as
no
token
of
disapprobation
came
from
the
audience
i
began
to
hope
he
would
go
through
with
his
parts
without
exciting
suspicion
of
his
condition
but
before
he
had
half
finished
his
representation
of
booth
in
the
soliloquy
in
the
opening
act
of
richard
the
house
discovered
that
he
was
very
drunk
and
began
to
hiss
this
only
seemed
to
stimulate
him
to
make
an
effort
to
appear
sober
which
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
only
made
matters
worse
and
the
hissing
increased
i
lost
all
patience
and
going
on
the
stage
and
taking
the
drunken
fellow
by
the
collar
i
apologized
to
the
audience
assuring
them
that
he
should
not
appear
before
them
again
i
was
about
to
march
him
off
when
he
stepped
to
the
front
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
booth
often
appeared
on
the
stage
in
a
state
of
inebriety
and
i
was
simply
giving
you
a
truthful
representation
of
him
on
such
occasions
i
beg
to
be
permitted
to
proceed
with
my
the
audience
at
once
supposed
it
was
all
right
and
cried
out
go
on
go
on
which
he
did
and
at
every
imitation
of
booth
whether
as
richard
shylock
or
sir
giles
overreach
he
received
a
hearty
round
of
applause
i
was
quite
delighted
with
his
success
but
when
he
came
to
imitate
forrest
and
hamblin
necessarily
representing
them
as
drunk
also
the
audience
could
be
no
longer
deluded
the
hissing
was
almost
deafening
and
i
was
forced
to
lead
the
actor
off
it
was
his
last
appearance
on
my
stage
from
the
first
it
was
my
study
to
give
my
patrons
a
superfluity
of
novelties
and
for
this
i
make
no
special
claim
to
generosity
for
it
was
strictly
a
business
transaction
to
send
away
my
visitors
more
than
doubly
satisfied
was
to
induce
them
to
come
again
and
to
bring
their
friends
i
meant
to
make
people
talk
about
my
museum
to
exclaim
over
its
wonders
to
have
men
and
women
all
over
the
country
say
there
is
not
another
place
in
the
united
states
where
so
much
can
be
seen
for
cents
as
in
barnum
s
american
it
was
the
best
advertisement
i
could
possibly
have
and
one
for
which
i
could
afford
to
pay
i
knew
too
that
it
was
an
honorable
advertisement
because
it
was
as
deserved
as
it
was
spontaneous
and
so
in
addition
to
the
permanent
collection
and
the
ordinary
attractions
of
the
stage
i
labored
to
keep
the
museum
well
supplied
with
transient
novelties
i
exhibited
such
living
curiosities
as
a
rhinoceros
giraffes
grizzly
bears
great
serpents
and
whatever
else
of
the
kind
money
would
buy
or
enterprise
secure
knowing
that
a
visit
to
my
varied
attractions
and
genuine
curiosities
was
well
worth
to
any
one
three
times
the
amount
asked
as
an
entrance
fee
i
confess
that
i
was
not
so
scrupulous
as
possibly
i
should
have
been
about
the
methods
used
to
call
public
attention
to
my
establishment
the
one
end
aimed
at
was
to
make
men
and
women
think
and
talk
and
wonder
and
as
a
practical
result
go
to
the
museum
this
was
my
constant
study
and
occupation
it
was
the
world
s
way
then
as
it
is
now
to
excite
the
community
with
flaming
posters
promising
almost
everything
for
next
to
nothing
i
confess
that
i
took
no
pains
to
set
my
enterprising
a
better
example
i
fell
in
with
the
world
s
way
and
if
my
puffing
was
more
persistent
my
advertising
more
audacious
my
posters
more
glaring
my
pictures
more
exaggerated
my
flags
more
patriotic
and
my
transparencies
more
brilliant
than
they
would
have
been
under
the
management
of
my
neighbors
it
was
not
because
i
had
less
scruple
than
they
but
more
energy
far
more
ingenuity
and
a
better
foundation
for
such
promises
in
all
this
if
i
can
not
be
justified
i
at
least
find
palliation
in
the
fact
that
i
presented
a
wilderness
of
wonderful
instructive
and
amusing
realities
of
such
evident
and
marked
merit
that
i
have
yet
to
learn
of
a
single
instance
where
a
visitor
went
away
from
the
museum
complaining
that
he
had
been
defrauded
of
his
money
surely
this
is
an
offset
to
any
eccentricities
to
which
i
may
have
resorted
to
make
my
establishment
widely
known
very
soon
after
introducing
my
extra
exhibitions
i
purchased
for
a
curiosity
which
had
much
merit
and
some
absurdity
it
was
a
model
of
niagara
falls
in
which
the
merit
was
that
the
proportions
of
the
great
cataract
the
trees
rocks
and
buildings
in
the
vicinity
were
mathematically
given
while
the
absurdity
was
in
introducing
real
water
to
represent
the
falls
yet
the
model
served
a
purpose
in
making
a
good
line
in
the
bill
an
end
in
view
which
was
never
neglected
and
it
helped
to
give
the
museum
notoriety
one
day
i
was
summoned
to
appear
before
the
board
of
croton
water
commissioners
and
was
informed
that
as
i
paid
only
per
annum
for
water
at
the
museum
i
must
pay
a
large
extra
compensation
for
the
supply
for
my
niagara
falls
i
begged
the
board
not
to
believe
all
that
appeared
in
the
papers
nor
to
interpret
my
too
literally
and
assured
them
that
a
single
barrel
of
water
if
my
pump
was
in
good
order
would
furnish
my
falls
for
a
month
it
was
even
so
for
the
water
flowed
into
a
reservoir
behind
the
scenes
and
was
forced
back
with
a
pump
over
the
falls
on
one
occasion
louis
gaylord
clark
the
editor
of
the
came
to
view
my
museum
and
introduced
himself
to
me
as
i
was
quite
anxious
that
my
establishment
should
receive
a
notice
at
his
hands
i
took
pains
to
show
him
everything
of
interest
except
the
niagara
falls
which
i
feared
would
prejudice
him
against
my
entire
show
but
as
we
passed
the
room
the
pump
was
at
work
warning
me
that
the
great
cataract
was
in
full
operation
and
clark
to
my
dismay
insisted
upon
seeing
it
well
barnum
i
declare
this
is
quite
a
new
idea
i
never
saw
the
like
no
i
faintly
inquired
with
something
like
reviving
hope
no
said
clark
and
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
i
never
shall
but
the
spoke
kindly
of
me
and
refrained
from
all
allusions
to
the
cataract
of
niagara
with
real
some
months
after
clark
came
in
breathless
one
day
and
asked
me
if
i
had
the
club
with
which
captain
cook
was
killed
as
i
had
a
lot
of
indian
war
clubs
in
the
collection
of
aboriginal
curiosities
and
owing
clark
something
on
the
old
niagara
falls
account
i
told
him
i
had
the
veritable
club
with
documents
which
placed
its
identity
beyond
question
and
i
showed
him
the
warlike
weapon
poor
cook
poor
cook
said
clark
musingly
well
barnum
he
continued
with
great
gravity
at
the
same
time
extending
his
hand
and
giving
mine
a
hearty
shake
i
am
really
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
i
had
an
irrepressible
desire
to
see
the
club
that
killed
captain
cook
and
i
felt
quite
confident
you
could
accommodate
me
i
have
been
in
half
a
dozen
smaller
museums
and
as
they
all
had
it
i
was
sure
a
large
establishment
like
yours
would
not
be
without
a
few
weeks
afterwards
i
wrote
to
clark
that
if
he
would
come
to
my
office
i
was
anxious
to
consult
him
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
he
came
and
i
said
now
i
don
t
want
any
of
your
nonsense
but
i
want
your
sober
he
assured
me
that
he
would
serve
me
in
any
way
in
his
power
and
i
proceeded
to
tell
him
about
a
wonderful
fish
from
the
nile
offered
to
me
for
exhibition
at
a
week
the
owner
of
which
was
willing
to
forfeit
if
within
six
weeks
this
fish
did
not
pass
through
a
transformation
in
which
the
tail
would
disappear
and
the
fish
would
then
have
legs
is
it
possible
asked
the
astonished
clark
i
assured
him
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
thereupon
he
advised
me
to
engage
the
wonder
at
any
price
that
it
would
startle
the
naturalists
wake
up
the
whole
scientific
world
draw
in
the
masses
and
make
for
the
museum
i
told
him
that
i
thought
well
of
the
speculation
only
i
did
not
like
the
name
of
the
fish
that
makes
no
difference
whatever
said
clark
what
is
the
name
of
the
fish
tadpole
i
replied
with
becoming
gravity
but
it
is
vulgarly
called
sold
by
thunder
exclaimed
clark
and
he
left
a
curiosity
which
in
an
extraordinary
degree
served
my
object
of
extending
the
notoriety
of
the
museum
was
the
fejee
it
has
been
supposed
that
this
mermaid
was
manufactured
by
my
order
but
such
is
not
the
fact
i
was
known
as
a
successful
showman
and
strange
things
of
every
sort
were
brought
to
me
from
all
quarters
for
sale
or
exhibition
in
the
summer
of
moses
kimball
of
the
boston
museum
came
to
new
york
and
showed
me
what
purported
to
be
a
mermaid
he
had
bought
it
from
a
sailor
whose
father
a
sea
captain
had
purchased
it
in
calcutta
in
from
some
japanese
sailors
i
may
mention
here
that
this
identical
preserved
specimen
was
exhibited
in
london
in
as
i
fully
verified
in
my
visit
to
that
city
in
for
i
found
an
advertisement
of
it
in
an
old
file
of
the
london
and
a
friend
gave
me
a
copy
of
the
published
by
limbird
strand
november
containing
a
cut
of
this
same
creature
and
two
pages
of
describing
it
together
with
an
account
of
other
mermaids
said
to
have
been
captured
in
different
parts
of
the
world
the
stated
that
this
specimen
was
the
great
source
of
attraction
in
the
british
metropolis
and
three
to
four
hundred
people
every
day
pay
their
shilling
to
see
this
was
the
curiosity
which
had
fallen
into
kimball
s
hands
i
requested
my
naturalist
s
opinion
of
the
genuineness
of
the
animal
and
he
said
he
could
not
conceive
how
it
could
have
been
manufactured
for
he
never
saw
a
monkey
with
such
peculiar
teeth
arms
hands
and
he
never
saw
a
fish
with
such
peculiar
fins
but
he
did
not
believe
in
mermaids
nevertheless
i
concluded
to
hire
this
curiosity
and
to
modify
the
general
incredulity
as
to
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
mermaids
and
to
awaken
curiosity
to
see
and
examine
the
specimen
i
invoked
the
potent
power
of
printer
s
ink
since
japan
has
been
opened
to
the
outer
world
it
has
been
discovered
that
certain
artists
in
that
country
manufacture
a
great
variety
of
fabulous
animals
with
an
ingenuity
and
mechanical
perfection
well
calculated
to
deceive
no
doubt
my
mermaid
was
a
specimen
of
this
curious
manufacture
i
used
it
mainly
to
advertise
the
regular
business
of
the
museum
and
this
effective
indirect
advertising
is
the
only
feature
i
can
commend
in
a
special
show
of
which
i
confess
i
am
not
proud
i
might
have
published
columns
in
the
newspapers
presenting
and
praising
the
great
collection
of
genuine
specimens
of
natural
history
in
my
exhibition
and
they
would
not
have
attracted
nearly
so
much
attention
as
did
a
few
paragraphs
about
the
mermaid
which
was
only
a
small
part
of
my
show
newspapers
throughout
the
country
copied
the
mermaid
notices
for
they
were
novel
and
caught
the
attention
of
readers
thus
was
the
fame
of
the
museum
as
well
as
the
mermaid
wafted
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
i
was
careful
to
keep
up
the
excitement
for
i
knew
that
every
dollar
sown
in
advertising
would
return
in
tens
and
perhaps
hundreds
in
a
future
harvest
and
after
obtaining
all
the
notoriety
possible
by
advertising
and
by
exhibiting
the
mermaid
at
the
museum
i
sent
the
curiosity
throughout
the
country
directing
my
agent
to
everywhere
advertise
it
as
from
barnum
s
great
american
museum
new
the
effect
was
immediately
felt
money
flowed
in
rapidly
and
was
readily
expended
in
more
advertising
while
i
expended
money
liberally
for
attractions
for
the
inside
of
my
museum
and
bought
or
hired
everything
curious
or
rare
which
was
offered
or
could
be
found
i
was
prodigal
in
my
outlays
to
arrest
or
arouse
public
attention
when
i
became
proprietor
of
the
establishment
there
were
only
the
words
american
museum
to
indicate
the
character
of
the
concern
there
was
no
bustle
or
activity
about
the
place
no
posters
to
announce
what
was
to
be
seen
the
whole
exterior
was
as
dead
as
the
skeletons
and
stuffed
skins
within
my
experiences
had
taught
me
the
advantages
of
advertising
i
printed
whole
columns
in
the
papers
setting
forth
the
wonders
of
my
establishment
old
fogies
opened
their
eyes
in
amazement
at
a
man
who
could
expend
hundreds
of
dollars
in
announcing
a
show
of
stuffed
monkey
skins
but
these
same
old
fogies
paid
their
quarters
nevertheless
and
when
they
saw
the
curiosities
and
novelties
in
the
museum
halls
they
like
all
other
visitors
were
astonished
as
well
as
pleased
and
went
home
and
told
their
friends
and
neighbors
and
thus
assisted
in
advertising
my
business
for
other
and
not
less
effective
advertising
flags
and
banners
began
to
adorn
the
exterior
of
the
building
i
kept
a
band
of
music
on
the
front
balcony
and
announced
free
music
for
the
people
said
well
that
barnum
is
a
liberal
fellow
to
give
us
music
for
nothing
and
they
flocked
down
to
hear
my
outdoor
free
concerts
but
i
took
pains
to
select
and
maintain
the
poorest
band
i
could
find
one
whose
discordant
notes
would
drive
the
crowd
into
the
museum
out
of
earshot
of
my
outside
orchestra
of
course
the
music
was
poor
when
people
expect
to
get
something
for
nothing
they
are
sure
to
be
cheated
and
generally
deserve
to
be
and
so
no
doubt
some
of
my
patrons
were
sorely
disappointed
but
when
they
came
inside
and
paid
to
be
amused
and
instructed
i
took
care
to
see
that
they
not
only
received
the
full
worth
of
their
money
but
were
more
than
satisfied
powerful
drummond
lights
were
placed
at
the
top
of
the
museum
which
in
the
darkest
night
threw
a
flood
of
light
up
and
down
broadway
from
the
battery
to
niblo
s
that
would
enable
one
to
read
a
newspaper
in
the
street
these
were
the
first
drummond
lights
ever
seen
in
new
york
and
they
made
people
talk
and
so

once
occupied

with
pictures
of

of
beasts

things
and
in
which
were
treasures
that
brought
treasures
and
notoriety

me
the
jenny

enterprise
was
more
audacious
more
immediately
remunerative
and
i
remember
it
with
a
pride
which
i
do
not
attempt
to
conceal
but
instinctively
i
often
go
back
and
live
over
again
the
old
days
of
my
struggles
and
triumphs
in
the
american
museum
the
museum
was
always
open
at
sunrise
and
this
was
so
well
known
throughout
the
country
that
strangers
coming
to
the
city
would
often
take
a
tour
through
my
halls
before
going
to
breakfast
or
to
their
hotels
i
do
not
believe
there
was
ever
a
more
truly
popular
place
of
amusement
i
frequently
compared
the
annual
number
of
visitors
with
the
number
officially
reported
as
visiting
free
of
charge
the
british
museum
in
london
and
my
list
was
invariably
the
larger
nor
do
i
believe
that
any
man
or
manager
ever
labored
more
industriously
to
please
his
patrons
i
furnished
the
most
attractive
exhibitions
which
money
could
procure
i
abolished
all
vulgarity
and
profanity
from
the
stage
and
i
prided
myself
upon
the
fact
that
parents
and
children
could
attend
the
dramatic
performances
in
the
lecture
room
and
not
be
shocked
or
offended
by
anything
they
might
see
or
hear
i
introduced
the
moral
drama
producing
such
plays
as
the
drunkard
uncle
tom
s
cabin
moses
in
egypt
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
occasional
spectacular
melodramas
produced
with
great
care
and
at
considerable
outlay
sothern
who
has
since
attained
such
celebrity
at
home
and
abroad
as
a
character
actor
was
a
member
of
my
dramatic
company
for
one
or
two
seasons
barney
williams
also
began
his
theatrical
career
at
the
museum
occupying
at
first
quite
a
subordinate
position
at
a
salary
of
ten
dollars
a
week
during
the
past
twelve
or
fifteen
years
i
presume
his
weekly
receipts
when
he
has
acted
have
been
nearly
the
late
miss
mary
gannon
also
commenced
at
the
museum
and
many
more
actors
and
actresses
of
celebrity
have
been
from
time
to
time
engaged
there
what
was
once
the
small
lecture
room
was
converted
into
a
spacious
and
beautiful
theatre
extending
over
the
lots
adjoining
the
museum
and
capable
of
holding
about
three
thousand
persons
the
saloons
were
greatly
multiplied
and
enlarged
and
the
egress
having
been
made
to
work
to
perfection
on
holidays
i
advertised
lecture
room
performances
every
hour
through
the
afternoon
and
evening
and
consequently
the
actors
and
actresses
were
dressed
for
the
stage
as
early
as
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
did
not
resume
their
ordinary
clothes
till
ten
o
clock
at
night
in
these
busy
days
the
meals
for
the
company
were
brought
in
and
served
in
the
and
and
the
company
always
received
extra
pay
leaving
nothing
undone
that
would
bring
barnum
and
his
museum
before
the
public
i
often
engaged
some
exhibition
knowing
that
it
would
directly
bring
no
extra
dollars
to
the
treasury
but
hoping
that
it
would
incite
a
newspaper
paragraph
which
would
float
through
the
columns
of
the
american
press
and
be
copied
perhaps
abroad
and
my
hopes
in
this
respect
were
often
gratified
i
confess
that
i
liked
the
museum
mainly
for
the
opportunities
it
afforded
for
rapidly
making
money
before
i
bought
it
i
weighed
the
matter
well
in
my
mind
and
was
convinced
that
i
could
present
to
the
american
public
such
a
variety
quantity
and
quality
of
amusement
blended
with
instruction
all
for
cents
children
half
price
that
my
attractions
would
be
irresistible
and
my
fortune
certain
i
myself
relished
a
higher
grade
of
amusement
and
i
was
a
frequent
attendant
at
the
opera
concerts
lectures
and
the
like
but
i
worked
for
the
million
and
i
knew
the
only
way
to
make
a
million
from
my
patrons
was
to
give
them
abundant
and
wholesome
attractions
for
a
small
sum
of
money
about
the
first
of
july
i
began
to
make
arrangements
for
extra
novelties
additional
performances
a
large
amount
of
extra
advertising
and
an
outdoor
display
for
the
glorious
large
particolored
bills
were
ordered
transparencies
were
prepared
the
free
band
of
music
was
augmented
by
a
trumpeter
and
columns
of
advertisements
headed
with
large
capitals
were
written
and
put
on
file
i
wanted
to
run
out
a
string
of
american
flags
across
the
street
on
that
day
for
i
knew
there
would
be
thousands
of
people
passing
the
museum
with
leisure
and
and
i
felt
confident
that
an
unusual
display
of
national
flags
would
arrest
their
patriotic
attention
and
bring
many
of
them
within
my
walls
unfortunately
for
my
purpose
paul
s
church
stood
directly
opposite
and
there
was
nothing
to
which
i
could
attach
my
unless
it
might
be
one
of
the
trees
in
the
i
went
to
the
vestrymen
for
permission
to
so
attach
my
flag
rope
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
they
were
indignant
at
what
they
called
my
insulting
proposition
such
a
concession
would
be
i
plied
them
with
arguments
and
appealed
to
their
patriotism
but
in
vain
returning
to
the
museum
i
gave
orders
to
have
the
string
of
flags
made
ready
with
directions
at
daylight
on
the
fourth
of
july
to
attach
one
end
of
the
rope
to
one
of
the
third
story
windows
of
the
museum
and
the
other
end
to
a
tree
in
paul
s
churchyard
the
great
day
arrived
and
my
orders
were
strictly
followed
the
flags
attracted
great
attention
and
before
nine
o
clock
i
have
no
doubt
that
hundreds
of
additional
visitors
were
drawn
by
this
display
into
the
museum
by
nine
broadway
was
thronged
and
about
that
time
two
gentlemen
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
rushed
into
my
office
announcing
themselves
as
injured
and
insulted
vestrymen
of
paul
s
church
keep
cool
gentlemen
said
i
i
guess
it
is
all
right
indignantly
exclaimed
one
of
them
do
you
think
it
is
right
to
attach
your
museum
to
our
church
we
will
show
you
what
is
right
and
what
is
law
if
we
live
till
those
flags
must
come
down
thank
you
i
said
but
let
us
not
be
in
a
hurry
i
will
go
out
with
you
and
look
at
them
and
i
guess
we
can
make
it
all
going
into
the
street
i
remarked
really
gentlemen
these
flags
look
very
beautiful
they
do
not
injure
your
tree
i
always
stop
my
balcony
music
for
your
accommodation
whenever
you
hold
services
and
it
is
but
fair
that
you
should
return
the
we
could
indict
your
music
as
you
call
it
as
a
nuisance
if
we
chose
answered
one
vestryman
and
now
i
tell
you
that
if
these
flags
are
not
taken
down
in
ten
minutes
will
cut
them
his
indignation
was
at
the
boiling
point
the
crowd
in
the
street
was
dense
and
the
angry
gesticulation
of
the
vestryman
attracted
their
attention
i
saw
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
parley
with
him
or
coax
him
and
so
assuming
an
angry
air
i
rolled
up
my
sleeves
and
exclaimed
in
a
loud
tone
well
mister
i
should
just
like
to
see
you
dare
to
cut
down
the
american
flag
on
the
fourth
of
july
you
must
be
a
britisher
to
make
such
a
threat
as
that
but
i
ll
show
you
a
thousand
pairs
of
yankee
hands
in
two
minutes
if
you
dare
to
attempt
to
take
down
the
stars
and
stripes
on
this
great
of
american
freedom
what
s
that
john
bull
asked
a
brawny
fellow
placing
himself
in
front
of
the
irate
vestryman
look
here
old
fellow
he
continued
if
you
want
to
save
a
whole
bone
in
your
body
you
had
better
slope
and
never
dare
to
talk
again
about
hauling
down
the
american
flag
in
the
city
of
new
throngs
of
excited
exasperated
men
crowded
around
and
the
vestryman
seeing
the
effect
of
my
ruse
smiled
faintly
and
said
oh
of
course
it
is
all
right
and
he
and
his
companion
quietly
edged
out
of
the
crowd
the
flags
remained
up
all
day
and
all
night
the
next
morning
i
sought
the
vanquished
vestrymen
and
obtained
formal
permission
to
make
this
use
of
the
tree
on
following
holidays
in
consideration
of
my
willingness
to
arrest
the
doleful
strains
of
my
discordant
balcony
band
whenever
services
were
held
on
week
days
in
the
church
on
that
fourth
of
july
at
one
o
clock
my
museum
was
so
densely
crowded
that
we
could
admit
no
more
visitors
and
we
were
compelled
to
stop
the
sale
of
tickets
i
pushed
through
the
throng
until
i
reached
the
roof
of
the
building
hoping
to
find
room
for
a
few
more
but
it
was
in
vain
looking
down
into
the
street
it
was
a
sad
sight
to
see
the
thousands
of
people
who
stood
ready
with
their
money
to
enter
the
museum
but
who
were
actually
turned
away
it
was
exceedingly
harrowing
to
my
feelings
rushing
down
stairs
i
told
my
carpenter
and
his
assistants
to
cut
through
the
partition
and
floor
in
the
rear
and
to
put
in
a
temporary
flight
of
stairs
so
as
to
let
out
people
by
that
egress
into
ann
street
by
three
o
clock
the
egress
illustration
over
was
opened
and
a
few
people
were
passed
down
the
new
stairs
while
a
corresponding
number
came
in
at
the
front
but
i
lost
a
large
amount
of
money
that
day
by
not
having
sufficiently
estimated
the
value
of
my
own
advertising
and
consequently
not
having
provided
for
the
thousands
who
had
read
my
announcements
and
seen
my
outside
show
and
had
taken
the
first
leisure
day
to
visit
the
museum
i
had
learned
one
lesson
however
and
that
was
to
have
the
egress
ready
on
future
holidays
early
in
the
following
march
i
received
notice
from
some
of
the
irish
population
that
they
meant
to
visit
me
in
great
numbers
on
st
patrick
s
day
in
the
all
right
said
i
to
my
carpenter
get
your
egress
ready
for
march
and
i
added
to
my
assistant
manager
if
there
is
much
of
a
crowd
don
t
let
a
single
person
pass
out
at
the
front
even
if
it
were
patrick
himself
put
every
man
out
through
the
egress
in
the
the
day
came
and
before
noon
we
were
caught
in
the
same
dilemma
as
we
were
on
the
fourth
of
july
the
museum
was
jammed
and
the
sale
of
tickets
was
stopped
i
went
to
the
egress
and
asked
the
sentinel
how
many
hundreds
had
passed
out
hundreds
he
replied
why
only
three
persons
have
gone
out
by
this
way
and
they
came
back
saying
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
begging
to
be
let
in
what
does
this
mean
i
inquired
surely
thousands
of
people
have
been
all
over
the
museum
since
they
came
certainly
was
the
reply
but
after
they
have
gone
from
one
saloon
to
another
and
have
been
on
every
floor
even
to
the
roof
they
come
down
and
travel
the
same
route
over
at
this
time
i
espied
a
tall
irish
woman
with
two
children
whom
i
had
happened
to
notice
when
they
came
in
early
in
the
morning
step
this
way
madam
said
i
politely
you
will
never
be
able
to
get
into
the
street
by
the
front
door
without
crushing
these
dear
children
we
have
opened
a
large
egress
here
and
you
can
pass
by
these
rear
stairs
into
ann
street
and
thus
avoid
all
sure
replied
the
woman
indignantly
an
i
m
not
going
out
at
all
at
all
nor
the
children
aither
for
we
ve
brought
our
dinners
and
we
are
going
to
stay
all
further
investigation
showed
that
pretty
much
all
of
my
visitors
had
brought
their
dinners
with
the
evident
intention
of
literally
making
a
day
of
no
one
expected
to
go
home
till
night
the
building
was
overcrowded
and
meanwhile
hundreds
were
waiting
at
the
front
entrance
to
get
in
when
they
could
in
despair
i
sauntered
upon
the
stage
behind
the
scenes
biting
my
lips
with
vexation
when
i
happened
to
see
the
at
work
and
a
happy
thought
struck
me
here
i
exclaimed
take
a
piece
of
canvas
four
feet
square
and
paint
on
it
as
soon
as
you
can
in
large
letters
the
seizing
his
brush
he
finished
the
sign
in
fifteen
minutes
and
i
directed
the
carpenter
to
nail
it
over
the
door
leading
to
the
back
stairs
he
did
so
and
as
the
crowd
after
making
the
entire
tour
of
the
establishment
came
pouring
down
the
main
stairs
from
the
third
story
they
stopped
and
looked
at
the
new
sign
while
some
of
them
read
audibly
to
the
the
aigress
said
others
sure
that
s
an
animal
we
haven
t
seen
and
the
throng
began
to
pour
down
the
back
stairs
only
to
find
that
the
aigress
was
the
elephant
and
that
the
elephant
was
all
out
o
doors
or
so
much
of
it
as
began
with
ann
street
meanwhile
i
began
to
accommodate
those
who
had
long
been
waiting
with
their
money
at
the
broadway
entrance
notwithstanding
my
continual
outlays
for
additional
novelties
and
attractions
or
rather
i
might
say
because
of
these
outlays
money
poured
in
upon
me
so
rapidly
that
i
was
sometimes
actually
embarrassed
to
devise
means
to
carry
out
my
original
plan
for
laying
out
the
entire
profits
of
the
first
year
in
advertising
i
meant
to
sow
first
and
reap
afterwards
i
finally
hit
upon
a
plan
which
cost
a
large
sum
and
that
was
to
prepare
large
oval
oil
paintings
to
be
placed
between
the
windows
of
the
entire
building
representing
nearly
every
important
animal
known
in
zoology
these
paintings
were
put
on
the
building
in
a
single
night
and
so
complete
a
transformation
in
the
appearance
of
an
edifice
is
seldom
witnessed
when
the
living
stream
rolled
down
broadway
the
next
morning
and
reached
the
astor
house
corner
opposite
the
museum
it
seemed
to
meet
with
a
sudden
check
i
never
before
saw
so
many
open
mouths
and
astonished
eyes
some
people
were
puzzled
to
know
what
it
all
meant
some
looked
as
if
they
thought
it
was
an
enchanted
palace
that
had
suddenly
sprung
up
others
exclaimed
well
the
animals
all
seem
to
have
broken
out
last
night
and
hundreds
came
in
to
see
how
the
establishment
survived
the
sudden
eruption
at
all
events
from
that
morning
the
museum
receipts
took
a
jump
forward
of
nearly
a
hundred
dollars
a
day
and
they
never
fell
back
again
strangers
would
look
at
this
great
pictorial
magazine
and
argue
that
an
establishment
with
so
many
animals
on
the
outside
must
have
something
on
the
inside
and
in
they
would
go
to
see
inside
i
took
particular
pains
to
please
and
astonish
these
strangers
and
when
they
went
back
to
the
country
they
carried
plenty
of
pictorial
bills
and
lithographs
which
i
always
lavishly
furnished
and
thus
the
fame
of
barnum
s
museum
became
so
that
people
scarcely
thought
of
visiting
the
city
without
going
to
my
establishment
in
fact
the
museum
had
become
an
established
institution
in
the
land
now
and
then
some
one
would
cry
out
humbug
and
charlatan
but
so
much
the
better
for
me
it
helped
to
advertise
me
and
i
was
willing
to
bear
the
reputation
and
i
engaged
queer
curiosities
and
even
monstrosities
simply
to
add
to
the
notoriety
of
the
museum
valentine
will
be
remembered
by
many
as
a
man
who
gave
imitations
and
delineations
of
eccentric
characters
he
was
quite
a
card
at
the
museum
when
i
first
purchased
that
establishment
and
before
i
introduced
dramatic
representations
into
the
lecture
his
representations
were
usually
given
as
follows
a
small
table
was
placed
in
about
the
centre
of
the
stage
a
curtain
reaching
to
the
floor
covered
the
front
and
two
ends
of
the
table
under
this
table
on
little
shelves
and
hooks
were
placed
caps
hats
coats
wigs
moustaches
curls
cravats
and
shirt
collars
and
all
sorts
of
gear
for
changing
the
appearance
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
person
valentine
would
seat
himself
in
a
chair
behind
the
table
and
addressing
his
audience
would
state
his
intention
to
represent
different
peculiar
characters
male
and
female
including
the
yankee
tin
peddler
tabitha
twist
a
maiden
lady
sam
slick
the
precocious
author
solomon
jenkins
a
crusty
old
bachelor
with
a
song
the
with
his
refractory
pupils
with
many
other
characters
and
he
simply
asked
the
indulgence
of
the
audience
for
a
few
seconds
between
each
imitation
to
enable
him
to
stoop
down
behind
the
table
and
dress
each
character
appropriately
the
doctor
himself
was
a
most
eccentric
character
he
was
very
nervous
and
was
always
fretting
lest
his
audience
should
be
composed
of
persons
who
would
not
appreciate
his
during
one
of
his
engagements
the
lecture
room
performances
consisted
of
negro
minstrelsy
and
valentine
s
imitations
as
the
minstrels
gave
the
entire
first
half
of
the
entertainment
the
doctor
would
post
himself
at
the
entrance
to
the
museum
to
study
the
character
of
the
visitors
from
their
appearance
he
fancied
that
he
was
a
great
reader
of
character
in
this
way
and
as
most
of
my
visitors
were
from
the
country
the
doctor
after
closely
perusing
their
faces
would
decide
that
they
were
not
the
kind
of
persons
who
would
appreciate
his
efforts
and
this
made
him
extremely
nervous
when
this
idea
was
once
in
his
head
it
took
complete
possession
of
the
poor
doctor
and
worked
him
up
into
a
nervous
excitement
which
it
was
often
painful
to
behold
every
face
was
a
dagger
to
the
doctor
for
he
had
a
perfect
horror
of
exhibiting
to
an
unappreciative
audience
when
so
much
excited
that
he
could
stand
at
the
door
no
longer
the
disgusted
doctor
would
come
into
my
office
and
pour
out
his
lamentations
in
this
wise
there
barnum
i
never
saw
such
a
stupid
lot
of
country
bumpkins
in
my
life
i
shan
t
be
able
to
get
a
smile
out
of
them
i
had
rather
be
than
attempt
to
satisfy
an
audience
who
have
not
got
the
brains
to
appreciate
me
sir
mine
is
a
highly
intellectual
entertainment
and
none
but
refined
and
educated
persons
can
comprehend
oh
i
think
you
will
make
them
laugh
some
doctor
i
replied
laugh
sir
laugh
why
sir
they
have
no
laugh
in
them
sir
and
if
they
had
your
devilish
nigger
minstrels
would
get
it
all
out
of
them
before
i
don
t
get
excited
doctor
i
said
you
will
please
the
impossible
sir
i
was
a
fool
to
ever
permit
my
entertainment
to
be
mixed
up
with
that
of
nigger
but
you
could
not
give
an
entire
entertainment
satisfactorily
to
the
public
they
want
more
then
you
should
have
got
something
more
refined
sir
why
one
of
those
cursed
nigger
excites
your
audience
so
they
don
t
want
to
hear
a
word
from
me
at
all
events
i
ought
to
commence
the
entertainment
and
let
the
niggers
finish
up
i
tell
you
barnum
i
won
t
stand
it
i
would
rather
go
to
the
i
won
t
stay
here
over
a
fortnight
longer
it
is
killing
me
in
this
excited
state
the
doctor
would
go
upon
the
stage
dressed
very
neatly
in
a
suit
of
black
addressing
a
few
pleasant
words
to
the
audience
he
would
then
take
a
seat
behind
his
little
table
and
with
a
broad
smile
covering
his
countenance
would
ask
the
audience
to
excuse
him
a
few
seconds
and
he
would
appear
as
tabitha
twist
a
literary
spinster
of
on
these
occasions
i
was
usually
behind
the
scenes
standing
at
one
of
the
wings
opposite
the
doctor
s
table
where
i
could
see
and
hear
all
that
occurred
behind
the
the
moment
the
doctor
was
down
behind
the
table
a
wonderful
change
came
over
that
smiling
countenance
blast
this
infernal
stupid
audience
they
would
not
laugh
to
save
the
city
of
new
york
said
the
doctor
while
he
rapidly
slipped
on
a
lady
s
cap
and
a
pair
of
long
curls
then
while
arranging
a
lace
handkerchief
around
his
shoulders
he
would
grate
his
teeth
and
curse
the
museum
its
manager
the
audience
and
everybody
else
the
instant
the
handkerchief
was
pinned
the
broad
smile
would
come
upon
his
face
and
up
would
go
his
head
and
shoulders
showing
to
the
audience
a
rollicking
specimen
of
a
old
maid
how
do
you
do
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
all
know
me
tabitha
twist
the
happiest
maiden
in
the
village
always
laughing
now
i
ll
sing
you
one
of
my
prettiest
the
mock
maiden
would
then
sing
a
lively
funny
ditty
followed
by
faint
applause
and
down
would
bob
the
head
behind
the
table
to
prepare
for
a
presentation
of
sam
slick
curse
such
a
set
of
fools
off
goes
the
cap
followed
by
the
curls
they
think
it
s
a
country
sunday
school
taking
off
the
lace
handkerchief
i
expect
they
will
hiss
me
next
the
donkeys
on
goes
a
light
wig
of
long
flowing
hair
i
wish
the
old
museum
was
sunk
in
the
atlantic
puts
on
a
yankee
and
broadbrimmed
hat
i
never
will
be
caught
in
this
infernal
place
curse
it
up
jump
head
and
shoulders
of
the
yankee
and
sam
slick
junior
sings
out
a
merry
ha
ha
why
folks
how
de
dew
darn
glad
to
see
you
by
hokey
i
came
down
here
to
have
lots
of
fun
for
you
know
i
always
believe
we
must
laugh
and
grow
after
five
minutes
of
similar
rollicking
nonsense
down
would
bob
the
head
again
and
the
cursing
swearing
tearing
and
would
commence
and
continue
till
the
next
character
appeared
to
the
audience
bedecked
with
smiles
and
on
several
occasions
i
got
up
baby
shows
at
which
i
paid
liberal
prizes
for
the
finest
baby
the
fattest
baby
the
handsomest
twins
for
triplets
and
so
on
i
always
gave
several
months
notice
of
these
intended
shows
and
limited
the
number
of
babies
at
each
exhibition
to
one
hundred
long
before
the
appointed
time
the
list
would
be
full
and
i
have
known
many
a
fond
mother
to
weep
bitterly
because
the
time
for
application
was
closed
and
she
could
not
have
the
opportunity
to
exhibit
her
beautiful
baby
these
shows
were
as
popular
as
they
were
unique
and
while
they
paid
in
a
financial
point
of
view
my
chief
object
in
getting
them
up
was
to
set
the
newspapers
to
talking
about
me
thus
giving
another
blast
on
the
trumpet
which
i
always
tried
to
keep
blowing
for
the
museum
flower
shows
dog
shows
poultry
shows
and
bird
shows
were
held
at
intervals
in
my
establishment
and
in
each
instance
the
same
end
was
attained
as
by
the
baby
shows
i
gave
prizes
in
the
shape
of
medals
money
and
diplomas
and
the
whole
came
back
to
me
in
the
shape
of
advertising
there
was
great
difficulty
however
in
awarding
the
illustration
and
principal
prize
of
at
the
baby
shows
every
mother
thought
her
own
baby
the
brightest
and
best
and
confidently
expected
the
capital
prize
for
where
was
ever
seen
the
mother
would
give
her
baby
for
another
not
foreseeing
this
when
i
first
stepped
into
the
expectant
circle
and
announced
in
a
matter
of
fact
way
that
a
committee
of
ladies
had
decided
upon
the
baby
of
mrs
so
and
so
as
entitled
to
the
leading
prize
i
was
for
the
storm
of
indignation
that
arose
on
every
side
disappointed
and
as
they
thought
deeply
injured
mothers
made
common
cause
and
pronounced
the
successful
little
one
the
meanest
homeliest
baby
in
the
lot
and
roundly
abused
me
and
my
committee
for
our
stupidity
and
partiality
very
well
ladies
said
i
in
the
first
instance
select
a
committee
of
your
own
and
i
will
give
another
prize
to
the
baby
you
shall
pronounce
to
be
the
best
this
was
only
throwing
oil
upon
flame
the
confederates
were
deadly
enemies
from
the
moment
and
no
new
babies
were
presented
in
competition
for
the
second
prize
thereafter
i
took
good
care
to
send
in
a
written
report
and
did
not
attempt
to
announce
the
prize
in
person
at
the
first
exhibition
of
the
kind
there
was
a
vague
yet
very
current
rumor
that
in
the
haste
of
departure
from
the
museum
several
young
mothers
had
exchanged
babies
for
the
babies
were
nearly
all
of
the
same
age
and
were
generally
dressed
alike
and
did
not
discover
the
mistake
till
they
arrived
home
and
some
such
conversation
as
this
occurred
between
husband
and
wife
did
our
baby
take
the
prize
no
the
darling
was
cheated
out
of
well
why
didn
t
you
bring
home
the
same
baby
you
carried
to
the
museum
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
could
not
trace
this
cruel
rumor
to
an
authentic
source
in
june
a
herd
of
yearling
buffaloes
was
on
exhibition
in
boston
i
bought
the
lot
brought
them
to
new
jersey
hired
the
race
course
at
hoboken
chartered
the
for
one
day
and
advertised
that
a
hunter
had
arrived
with
a
herd
of
buffaloes
i
was
careful
not
to
state
their
age
and
that
august
there
would
be
a
grand
buffalo
hunt
on
the
hoboken
race
course
all
persons
to
be
admitted
free
of
charge
the
appointed
day
was
warm
and
delightful
and
no
less
than
thousand
people
crossed
the
north
river
in
the
to
enjoy
the
cooling
breeze
and
to
see
the
grand
buffalo
the
hunter
was
dressed
as
an
indian
and
mounted
on
horseback
he
proceeded
to
show
how
the
wild
buffalo
is
captured
with
a
lasso
but
unfortunately
the
yearlings
would
not
run
till
the
crowd
gave
a
great
shout
expressive
at
once
of
derision
and
delight
at
the
harmless
humbug
this
shout
started
the
young
animals
into
a
weak
gallop
and
the
lasso
was
duly
thrown
over
the
head
of
the
largest
calf
the
crowd
roared
with
laughter
listened
to
my
balcony
band
which
i
also
furnished
free
and
then
started
for
new
york
little
dreaming
who
was
the
author
of
this
sensation
or
what
was
its
object
willis
then
editor
of
the
wrote
an
article
illustrating
the
perfect
good
nature
with
which
the
american
public
submit
to
a
clever
humbug
he
said
that
he
went
to
hoboken
to
witness
the
buffalo
hunt
it
was
nearly
four
o
clock
when
the
boat
left
the
foot
of
barclay
street
and
it
was
so
densely
crowded
that
many
persons
were
obliged
to
stand
on
the
railings
and
hold
on
to
the
awning
posts
when
they
reached
the
hoboken
side
a
boat
equally
crowded
was
coming
out
of
the
slip
the
passengers
just
arriving
cried
out
to
those
who
were
coming
away
is
the
buffalo
hunt
over
to
which
came
the
reply
yes
and
it
was
the
biggest
humbug
you
ever
heard
of
willis
added
that
passengers
on
the
boat
with
him
instantly
gave
three
cheers
for
the
author
of
the
humbug
whoever
he
might
be
after
the
public
had
enjoyed
a
laugh
for
several
days
over
the
hoboken
free
grand
buffalo
hunt
i
permitted
it
to
be
announced
that
the
proprietor
of
the
american
museum
was
responsible
for
the
joke
thus
using
the
buffalo
hunt
as
a
to
attract
public
attention
to
my
museum
the
object
was
accomplished
and
although
some
people
cried
out
humbug
i
had
added
to
the
notoriety
which
i
so
much
wanted
and
i
was
satisfied
as
for
the
cry
of
humbug
it
never
harmed
me
and
i
was
in
the
position
of
the
actor
who
had
much
rather
be
roundly
abused
than
not
to
be
noticed
at
all
i
ought
to
add
that
the
thousand
sixpences
the
usual
fare
received
for
ferry
fares
less
what
i
paid
for
the
charter
of
the
boats
on
that
one
day
more
than
remunerated
me
for
the
cost
of
the
buffaloes
and
the
expenses
of
the
hunt
and
the
enormous
gratuitous
advertising
of
the
museum
must
also
be
placed
to
my
credit
with
the
same
object
that
is
advertising
my
museum
i
purchased
for
in
cincinnati
ohio
a
woolly
horse
i
found
on
exhibition
in
that
city
it
was
a
well
formed
small
sized
horse
with
no
mane
and
not
a
particle
of
hair
on
his
tail
while
his
entire
body
and
legs
were
covered
with
thick
fine
hair
or
wool
which
curled
tight
to
his
skin
this
horse
was
foaled
in
indiana
and
was
a
remarkable
freak
of
nature
and
certainly
a
very
curious
looking
animal
i
had
not
the
remotest
idea
when
i
bought
this
horse
what
i
should
do
with
him
but
when
the
news
came
that
colonel
john
fremont
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
lost
in
the
snows
of
the
rocky
mountains
was
in
safety
the
woolly
horse
was
exhibited
in
new
york
and
was
widely
advertised
as
a
most
remarkable
animal
that
had
been
captured
by
the
great
explorer
s
party
in
the
passes
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
exhibition
met
with
only
moderate
success
in
new
york
and
in
several
northern
provincial
towns
and
the
show
would
have
fallen
flat
in
washington
had
it
not
been
for
the
of
colonel
thomas
benton
then
a
united
states
senator
from
missouri
he
went
to
the
show
and
then
caused
the
arrest
of
my
agent
for
obtaining
cents
from
him
under
false
no
mention
had
been
made
of
this
curious
animal
in
any
letter
he
had
received
from
his
colonel
john
fremont
and
therefore
the
woolly
horse
had
not
been
captured
by
any
of
fremont
s
party
the
reasoning
was
hardly
as
sound
as
were
most
of
the
arguments
of
old
bullion
and
the
case
was
dismissed
after
a
few
days
of
merriment
public
curiosity
no
longer
turned
in
that
direction
and
the
old
horse
was
permitted
to
retire
to
private
life
my
object
in
the
exhibition
however
was
fully
attained
when
it
was
generally
known
that
the
proprietor
of
the
american
museum
was
also
the
owner
of
the
famous
woolly
horse
it
caused
yet
more
talk
about
me
and
my
establishment
and
visitors
began
to
say
that
they
would
give
more
to
see
the
proprietor
of
the
museum
than
to
view
the
entire
collection
of
curiosities
as
for
my
ruse
in
advertising
the
woolly
horse
as
having
been
captured
by
fremont
s
exploring
party
of
course
the
announcement
neither
added
to
nor
took
from
the
interest
of
the
exhibition
but
it
arrested
public
attention
and
it
was
the
only
feature
of
the
show
that
i
now
care
to
forget
it
will
be
seen
that
very
much
of
the
success
which
attended
my
many
years
proprietorship
of
the
american
museum
was
due
to
advertising
and
especially
to
my
odd
methods
of
advertising
always
claiming
that
i
had
curiosities
worth
showing
and
worth
seeing
and
exhibited
dog
cheap
at
cents
admission
children
half
price
i
studied
ways
to
arrest
public
attention
to
startle
to
make
people
talk
and
wonder
in
short
to
let
the
world
know
that
i
had
a
museum
about
this
time
i
engaged
a
band
of
indians
from
iowa
they
had
never
seen
a
railroad
or
steamboat
until
they
saw
them
on
the
route
from
iowa
to
new
york
of
course
they
were
wild
and
had
but
faint
ideas
of
civilization
the
party
comprised
large
and
noble
specimens
of
the
untutored
savage
as
well
as
several
very
beautiful
squaws
with
two
or
three
interesting
they
lived
and
lodged
in
a
large
room
on
the
top
floor
of
the
museum
and
cooked
their
own
victuals
in
their
own
way
they
gave
their
on
the
stage
in
the
lecture
room
with
great
vigor
and
enthusiasm
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
audiences
but
these
wild
indians
seemed
to
consider
their
dances
as
realities
hence
when
they
gave
a
real
war
dance
it
was
dangerous
for
any
parties
except
their
manager
and
interpreter
to
be
on
the
stage
for
the
moment
they
had
finished
their
war
dance
they
began
to
leap
and
peer
about
behind
the
scenes
in
search
of
victims
for
their
tomahawks
and
scalping
knives
indeed
lest
in
these
frenzied
moments
they
might
make
a
dash
at
the
orchestra
or
the
audience
we
had
a
high
rope
barrier
placed
between
them
and
the
savages
on
the
front
of
the
stage
after
they
had
been
a
week
in
the
museum
i
proposed
a
change
of
performance
for
the
week
following
by
introducing
new
dances
among
these
was
the
indian
wedding
dance
at
that
time
i
printed
but
one
set
of
posters
large
bills
per
week
so
that
whatever
was
announced
for
monday
was
repeated
every
day
and
evening
during
that
week
before
the
wedding
dance
came
off
on
monday
afternoon
i
was
informed
that
i
was
to
provide
a
large
new
red
woollen
blanket
at
a
cost
of
ten
dollars
for
the
bridegroom
to
present
to
the
father
of
the
bride
i
ordered
the
purchase
to
be
made
but
was
considerably
taken
aback
when
i
was
informed
that
i
must
have
another
new
blanket
for
the
evening
inasmuch
as
the
savage
old
indian
chief
to
the
bridegroom
would
not
consent
to
his
daughter
s
being
approached
with
the
wedding
dance
unless
he
had
his
blanket
present
i
undertook
to
explain
to
the
chief
through
the
interpreter
that
this
was
only
a
make
believe
wedding
but
the
old
savage
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
gave
such
a
terrific
ugh
that
i
was
glad
to
make
my
peace
by
ordering
another
blanket
as
we
gave
two
performances
per
day
i
was
out
of
pocket
for
twelve
wedding
blankets
that
week
one
of
the
beautiful
squaws
named
died
in
the
museum
she
had
been
a
great
favorite
with
many
ladies
among
whom
i
can
especially
name
sawyer
wife
of
the
rev
sawyer
was
buried
on
the
border
of
sylvan
water
at
greenwood
cemetery
where
a
small
monument
erected
by
her
friends
designates
her
last
resting
place
the
poor
indians
were
very
sorrowful
for
many
days
and
desired
to
get
back
again
to
their
western
wilds
the
father
and
the
betrothed
of
cooked
various
dishes
of
food
and
placed
them
upon
the
roof
of
the
museum
where
they
believed
the
spirit
of
their
departed
friend
came
daily
for
its
supply
and
these
dishes
were
renewed
every
morning
during
the
stay
of
the
indians
at
the
museum
it
was
sometimes
very
amusing
to
hear
the
remarks
of
strangers
who
came
to
visit
my
museum
one
afternoon
a
prim
maiden
lady
from
portland
maine
walked
into
my
private
office
where
i
was
busily
engaged
in
writing
and
taking
a
seat
on
the
sofa
she
asked
is
this
barnum
it
is
i
replied
is
this
barnum
the
proprietor
of
the
museum
she
asked
the
same
was
my
answer
why
really
barnum
she
continued
you
look
much
like
other
common
folks
after
i
remarked
that
i
presumed
i
did
but
i
could
not
help
it
and
i
hoped
she
was
not
disappointed
at
my
appearance
oh
no
she
said
i
suppose
i
have
no
right
to
be
disappointed
but
i
have
read
and
heard
so
much
about
you
and
your
museum
that
i
was
quite
prepared
to
be
i
asked
her
if
she
had
been
through
the
establishment
i
have
she
replied
i
came
in
immediately
after
breakfast
i
have
been
here
ever
since
and
i
can
say
i
think
with
the
queen
of
sheba
that
the
half
had
not
been
told
but
barnum
she
continued
i
have
long
felt
a
desire
to
see
you
i
wanted
to
attend
when
you
lectured
on
temperance
in
portland
but
i
had
a
severe
cold
and
could
not
go
do
you
like
my
collection
as
well
as
you
do
the
one
in
the
boston
museum
i
asked
dear
me
barnum
said
she
i
never
went
to
any
museum
before
nor
to
any
place
of
amusement
or
public
entertainment
excepting
our
school
exhibitions
and
i
have
sometimes
felt
that
they
even
may
be
wicked
for
some
parts
of
the
dialogues
seemed
frivolous
but
i
have
heard
so
much
of
your
moral
drama
and
the
great
good
you
are
doing
for
the
rising
generation
that
i
thought
i
must
come
here
and
see
for
we
represent
the
pathetic
story
of
charlotte
temple
in
the
lecture
room
i
remarked
with
an
inward
chuckle
at
the
peculiarities
of
my
singular
visitor
who
although
she
was
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
had
probably
never
been
in
an
audience
of
a
hundred
persons
unless
it
might
be
at
a
school
exhibition
or
in
sunday
school
or
in
church
indeed
i
am
quite
familiar
with
the
sad
history
of
miss
temple
and
i
think
i
can
derive
great
consolation
from
witnessing
the
representation
of
the
touching
at
this
moment
the
gong
sounded
to
announce
the
opening
of
the
lecture
room
and
the
crowd
passed
on
in
haste
to
secure
seats
my
spinster
visitor
sprang
to
her
feet
and
anxiously
inquired
are
the
services
about
to
commence
yes
i
replied
the
congregation
is
now
going
she
marched
along
with
the
crowd
as
demurely
as
if
she
was
going
to
a
funeral
after
she
was
seated
i
watched
her
and
in
the
course
of
the
play
i
noticed
that
she
was
several
times
so
much
overcome
as
to
be
moved
to
tears
she
was
very
much
affected
and
when
the
services
were
over
without
seeking
another
interview
with
me
she
went
silently
and
tearfully
away
one
day
two
city
boys
who
had
thoroughly
explored
the
wonders
of
the
museum
on
their
way
out
passed
the
open
door
of
my
private
office
and
seeing
me
sitting
there
one
of
them
exclaimed
to
his
companion
there
that
s
no
is
it
asked
the
other
and
then
with
his
mind
full
of
the
glories
of
the
stuffed
and
other
wealth
which
had
been
displayed
to
his
wondering
eyes
in
the
establishment
he
summed
up
his
views
of
the
vastness
and
value
of
the
whole
collection
and
its
fortunate
proprietor
in
a
single
sentence

found

peale
was
conducting
peale
s
museum
which
he
claimed
was
a
more
scientific
establishment
than
mine
and
he
pretended
to
appeal
to
a
higher
class
of
patrons
mesmerism
was
one
of
his
scientific
attractions
and
he
had
a
subject
upon
whom
he
operated
at
times
with
the
greatest
seeming
success
and
fairly
astonished
his
audiences
but
there
were
times
when
the
subject
was
wholly
unimpressible
and
then
those
who
had
paid
their
money
to
see
the
woman
put
into
the
mesmeric
state
cried
out
humbug
and
the
reputation
of
the
establishment
seriously
suffered
it
devolved
upon
me
to
open
a
rival
mesmeric
performance
and
accordingly
i
engaged
a
bright
little
girl
who
was
exceedingly
susceptible
to
such
mesmeric
influences
as
i
could
induce
that
is
she
learned
her
lesson
thoroughly
and
when
i
had
apparently
put
her
to
sleep
with
a
few
passes
and
stood
behind
her
she
seemed
to
be
duly
impressed
as
i
desired
raised
her
hands
as
i
willed
fell
from
her
chair
to
the
floor
and
if
i
put
candy
or
tobacco
into
my
mouth
she
was
duly
delighted
or
disgusted
she
never
failed
in
these
routine
performances
strange
to
say
believers
in
mesmerism
used
to
witness
her
performances
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
adduce
them
as
positive
proofs
that
there
was
something
in
mesmerism
and
they
applauded
tremendously
up
to
a
certain
point
that
point
was
reached
when
leaving
the
girl
asleep
i
called
up
some
one
in
the
audience
promising
to
put
him
in
the
same
state
within
five
minutes
or
forfeit
fifty
dollars
of
course
all
my
passes
would
not
put
any
man
in
the
mesmeric
state
at
the
end
of
three
minutes
he
was
as
wide
awake
as
ever
never
mind
i
would
say
looking
at
my
watch
i
have
two
minutes
more
and
meantime
to
show
that
a
person
in
this
state
is
utterly
insensible
to
pain
i
propose
to
cut
off
one
of
the
fingers
of
the
little
girl
who
is
still
i
would
then
take
out
my
knife
and
feel
of
the
edge
and
when
i
turned
around
to
the
girl
whom
i
left
on
the
chair
she
had
fled
behind
the
scenes
to
the
intense
amusement
of
the
greater
part
of
the
audience
and
to
the
amazement
of
the
mesmerists
who
were
present
why
where
s
my
little
girl
i
asked
with
feigned
astonishment
oh
she
ran
away
when
you
began
to
talk
about
cutting
off
then
she
was
wide
awake
was
she
of
course
she
was
all
the
i
suppose
so
and
my
dear
sir
i
promised
that
you
should
be
in
the
same
state
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
and
as
i
believe
you
are
so
i
do
not
forfeit
fifty
i
kept
up
this
performance
for
several
weeks
till
i
quite
killed
peale
s
genuine
mesmerism
in
the
rival
establishment
after
peale
yankee
hill
undertook
the
management
of
that
museum
but
in
a
little
while
he
failed
it
was
then
let
to
henry
bennett
who
reduced
the
entrance
price
to
one
shilling
a
half
price
which
led
me
to
characterize
his
concern
as
cheap
and
nasty
and
he
began
a
serious
rivalry
with
my
museum
his
main
reliances
were
burlesques
and
caricatures
of
whatever
novelties
i
was
exhibiting
thus
when
i
advertised
an
able
company
of
vocalists
as
the
orphean
family
bennett
announced
the
orphan
family
my
fejee
mermaid
he
offset
with
a
figure
made
of
a
monkey
and
codfish
joined
together
and
called
the
these
things
created
some
laughter
at
my
expense
but
they
also
served
to
advertise
my
museum
when
the
novelty
of
this
opposition
died
away
bennett
did
a
decidedly
losing
business
i
used
to
send
a
man
with
a
shilling
to
his
place
every
night
and
i
knew
exactly
how
much
he
was
doing
and
what
were
his
receipts
the
holidays
were
coming
and
might
tide
him
over
a
day
or
two
but
he
was
at
the
very
bottom
and
i
said
to
him
one
day
bennett
if
you
can
keep
open
one
week
after
new
year
s
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
he
made
every
effort
to
win
the
money
and
even
went
to
the
landlord
and
offered
him
the
entire
receipts
for
a
week
if
he
would
only
let
him
stay
there
but
he
would
not
do
it
and
the
day
after
new
year
s
january
bennett
shut
up
shop
having
lost
his
last
dollar
and
even
failing
to
secure
the
handsome
premium
i
offered
him
the
entire
collection
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
landlord
for
arrearages
of
rent
and
i
privately
purchased
it
for
cash
hired
the
building
and
secretly
engaged
bennett
as
my
agent
we
ran
a
very
spirited
opposition
for
a
long
time
and
abused
each
other
terribly
in
public
it
was
very
amusing
when
actors
and
performers
failed
to
make
terms
with
one
of
us
and
went
to
the
other
carrying
from
one
to
the
other
the
price
each
was
willing
to
pay
for
an
engagement
we
thus
used
to
hear
extraordinary
stories
about
each
other
s
liberal
terms
but
between
the
two
we
managed
to
secure
such
persons
as
we
wanted
at
about
the
rates
at
which
their
services
were
really
worth
while
these
people
were
thus
running
from
one
manager
to
the
other
supposing
we
were
rivals
bennett
said
to
me
one
day
you
and
i
are
like
a
pair
of
shears
we
seem
to
cut
each
other
but
we
only
cut
what
comes
i
ran
my
opposition
long
enough
to
beat
myself
it
answered
every
purpose
however
in
awakening
public
attention
to
my
museum
and
was
an
advantage
in
preventing
others
from
starting
a
genuine
opposition
at
the
end
of
six
months
the
whole
establishment
including
the
splendid
gallery
of
american
portraits
was
removed
to
the
american
museum
and
i
immediately
advertised
the
great
card
of
a
double
attraction
and
two
museums
in
one
without
extra
charge
a
museum
proper
obviously
depends
for
patronage
largely
upon
country
people
who
visit
the
city
with
a
worthy
curiosity
to
see
the
novelties
of
the
town
as
i
had
opened
a
dramatic
entertainment
in
connection
with
my
curiosities
it
was
clear
that
i
must
adapt
my
stage
to
the
wants
of
my
country
customers
while
i
was
disposed
to
amuse
my
provincial
patrons
i
was
determined
that
there
should
be
nothing
in
my
establishment
where
many
of
my
visitors
would
derive
their
first
impressions
of
city
life
that
could
contaminate
or
corrupt
them
at
this
period
it
was
customary
to
tolerate
very
considerable
license
on
the
stage
things
were
said
and
done
and
permitted
in
theatres
that
elsewhere
would
have
been
pronounced
highly
improper
the
public
seemed
to
demand
these
things
and
it
is
an
axiom
in
political
economy
that
the
demand
must
regulate
the
supply
but
i
determined
at
the
start
that
let
the
demand
be
what
it
might
the
museum
dramatic
entertainments
should
be
unexceptionable
on
the
score
of
morality
i
have
already
mentioned
some
of
the
immediate
reforms
i
made
in
the
abuses
of
the
stage
i
went
farther
and
at
the
risk
of
some
pecuniary
sacrifice
i
abolished
what
was
common
enough
in
other
theatres
even
the
most
respectable
and
was
generally
known
as
the
third
nor
was
a
bar
permitted
on
my
premises
to
be
sure
i
had
no
power
to
prevent
my
patrons
from
going
out
between
the
acts
and
getting
liquor
if
they
chose
to
do
so
and
i
gave
checks
as
is
done
in
other
theatres
and
some
of
my
city
customers
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
go
out
for
drinks
and
return
again
practically
then
it
was
much
the
same
as
if
i
had
kept
a
bar
in
the
museum
and
so
i
abolished
the
check
business
there
was
great
reason
to
apprehend
that
such
a
course
would
rob
me
of
the
patronage
of
a
considerable
class
of
but
i
rigidly
adhered
to
the
new
rule
and
what
i
may
have
lost
in
money
i
more
than
gained
in
the
greater
decorum
which
characterized
my
audiences
the
museum
became
a
mania
with
me
and
i
made
everything
possible
subservient
to
it
on
the
eve
of
elections
rival
politicians
would
ask
me
for
whom
i
was
going
to
vote
and
my
answer
invariably
was
i
vote
for
the
american
in
fact
at
that
time
i
cared
very
little
about
politics
and
a
great
deal
about
my
business
meanwhile
the
museum
prospered
wonderfully
and
everything
i
attempted
or
engaged
in
seemed
at
the
outset
an
assured
success
the
giants
whom
i
exhibited
from
time
to
time
were
always
literally
great
features
in
my
establishment
and
they
oftentimes
afforded
me
as
well
as
my
patrons
food
for
much
amusement
as
well
as
wonder
the
quaker
giant
hales
was
quite
a
wag
in
his
way
he
went
once
to
see
the
new
house
of
an
acquaintance
who
had
suddenly
become
rich
but
who
was
a
very
ignorant
man
when
he
came
back
he
described
the
wonders
of
the
mansion
and
said
that
the
proud
proprietor
showed
him
everything
from
basement
to
attic
parlors
dining
room
and
said
hales
what
he
called
his
study
meaning
i
suppose
the
place
where
he
intends
to
study
his
i
had
at
one
time
two
famous
men
the
french
giant
bihin
a
very
slim
man
and
the
arabian
giant
colonel
goshen
these
men
generally
got
on
together
very
well
though
of
course
each
was
jealous
of
the
other
and
of
the
attention
the
rival
received
or
the
notice
he
attracted
one
day
they
quarrelled
and
a
lively
interchange
of
compliments
ensued
the
arabian
calling
the
frenchman
a
shanghai
and
receiving
in
return
the
epithet
of
from
words
both
were
eager
to
proceed
to
blows
and
both
ran
to
my
collection
of
arms
one
seizing
the
club
with
which
captain
cook
or
any
other
man
might
have
been
killed
if
it
were
judiciously
wielded
and
the
other
laying
hands
on
a
sword
of
the
terrific
size
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
conventional
in
the
days
of
the
crusades
the
preparations
for
a
deadly
encounter
and
the
high
words
of
the
contending
parties
brought
a
dozen
of
the
museum
to
the
spot
and
these
men
threw
themselves
between
the
gigantic
combatants
hearing
the
disturbance
i
ran
from
my
private
office
to
the
duelling
ground
and
said
look
here
this
is
all
right
if
you
want
to
fight
each
other
maiming
and
perhaps
killing
one
or
both
of
you
that
is
your
affair
but
my
interest
lies
here
you
are
both
under
engagement
to
me
and
if
this
duel
is
to
come
off
i
and
the
public
have
a
right
to
participate
it
must
be
duly
advertised
and
must
take
place
on
the
stage
of
the
lecture
room
no
performance
of
yours
would
be
a
greater
attraction
and
if
you
kill
each
other
our
engagement
can
end
with
your
this
proposition
made
in
apparent
earnest
so
delighted
the
giants
that
they
at
once
burst
into
a
laugh
shook
hands
and
quarrelled
no
more
i
now
come
to
the
details
of
one
of
the
most
interesting
as
well
as
successful
of
all
the
show
enterprises
in
which
i
have
engaged
one
which
not
only
taxed
all
my
ingenuity
and
industry
but
which
gave
unqualified
illustration
of
the
delight
to
thousands
of
people
on
two
continents
and
put
enormous
sums
of
money
into
many
pockets
besides
my
own
in
november
i
was
in
albany
on
business
and
as
the
hudson
river
was
frozen
over
i
returned
to
new
york
by
the
housatonic
railroad
stopping
one
night
at
bridgeport
connecticut
with
my
brother
philo
barnum
who
at
that
time
kept
the
franklin
hotel
i
had
heard
of
a
remarkably
small
child
in
bridgeport
and
at
my
request
my
brother
brought
him
to
the
hotel
he
was
not
two
feet
high
he
weighed
less
than
sixteen
pounds
and
was
the
smallest
child
i
ever
saw
that
could
walk
alone
but
he
was
a
perfectly
formed
little
fellow
with
light
hair
and
ruddy
cheeks
and
he
enjoyed
the
best
of
health
he
was
exceedingly
bashful
but
after
some
coaxing
he
was
induced
to
talk
with
me
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
the
son
of
sherwood
stratton
and
that
his
own
name
was
charles
stratton
after
seeing
him
and
talking
with
him
i
at
once
determined
to
secure
his
services
from
his
parents
and
to
exhibit
him
in
public
but
as
he
was
only
five
years
of
age
to
exhibit
him
as
a
dwarf
might
provoke
the
inquiry
how
do
you
know
he
is
a
dwarf
some
liberty
might
be
taken
with
the
facts
but
even
with
this
license
i
felt
that
the
venture
was
only
an
experiment
and
i
engaged
him
for
four
weeks
at
three
dollars
a
week
with
all
travelling
and
boarding
charges
for
himself
and
his
mother
at
my
expense
they
came
to
new
york
thanksgiving
day
december
and
stratton
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
her
son
announced
on
my
museum
bills
as
general
tom
i
took
the
greatest
pains
to
educate
and
train
my
diminutive
prodigy
devoting
many
hours
to
the
task
by
day
and
by
night
and
i
was
very
successful
for
he
was
an
apt
pupil
with
a
great
deal
of
native
talent
and
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
he
made
rapid
progress
in
preparing
himself
for
such
performances
as
i
wished
him
to
undertake
and
he
became
very
much
attached
to
his
teacher
when
the
four
weeks
expired
i
him
for
one
year
at
seven
dollars
a
week
with
a
gratuity
of
fifty
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
engagement
and
the
privilege
of
exhibiting
him
anywhere
in
the
united
states
in
which
event
his
parents
were
to
accompany
him
and
i
was
to
pay
all
travelling
expenses
he
speedily
became
a
public
favorite
and
long
before
the
year
was
out
i
voluntarily
increased
his
weekly
salary
to
dollars
and
he
fairly
earned
it
sometimes
i
exhibited
him
for
several
weeks
in
succession
at
the
museum
and
when
i
wished
to
introduce
other
novelties
i
sent
him
to
different
towns
and
cities
accompanied
by
my
friend
fordyce
hitchcock
and
the
fame
of
general
tom
thumb
soon
spread
throughout
the
country
two
years
had
now
elapsed
since
i
bought
the
museum
and
i
had
long
since
paid
for
the
entire
establishment
from
the
profits
i
had
bought
out
my
only
rival
i
was
free
from
debt
and
had
a
handsome
surplus
in
the
treasury
the
business
had
long
ceased
to
be
an
experiment
it
was
an
established
success
and
was
in
such
perfect
running
order
that
it
could
safely
be
committed
to
the
management
of
trustworthy
and
tried
agents
accordingly
looking
for
a
new
field
for
my
individual
efforts
i
entered
into
an
agreement
for
general
tom
thumb
s
services
for
another
year
at
fifty
dollars
a
week
and
all
expenses
with
the
privilege
of
exhibiting
him
in
europe
i
proposed
to
test
the
curiosity
of
men
and
women
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
much
as
i
hoped
for
success
in
my
most
sanguine
moods
i
could
not
anticipate
the
half
of
what
was
in
store
for
me
i
did
not
foresee
nor
dream
that
i
was
shortly
to
be
brought
in
close
contact
with
kings
queens
lords
and
illustrious
commoners
and
that
such
association
by
means
of
my
exhibition
would
afterwards
introduce
me
to
the
great
public
and
the
public
s
money
which
was
to
fill
my
coffers
or
if
i
saw
some
such
future
it
was
dreamily
dimly
and
with
eyes
as
the
man
saw
the
trees
after
arranging
my
business
affairs
for
a
long
absence
and
making
every
preparation
for
an
extended
foreign
tour
on
thursday
january
i
went
on
board
the
new
and
fine
sailing
ship
yorkshire
captain
bailey
bound
for
liverpool
our
party
included
general
tom
thumb
his
parents
his
tutor
and
professor
guillaudeu
the
french
naturalist
we
were
accompanied
by
several
personal
friends
and
the
city
brass
band
kindly
volunteered
to
escort
us
to
sandy
hook
my
name
has
been
so
long
associated
with
mirthful
incidents
that
i
presume
many
persons
do
not
suppose
i
am
susceptible
of
sorrowful
or
even
sentimental
emotions
but
when
the
bell
of
the
steamer
that
towed
our
ship
down
the
bay
announced
the
hour
of
separation
and
then
followed
the
words
of
farewell
and
the
parting
grasp
of
friendly
hands
i
confess
that
i
was
very
much
in
the
melting
mood
and
when
the
band
played
home
sweet
home
i
was
moved
to
tears
a
voyage
to
liverpool
is
now
an
old
familiar
story
and
i
abstain
from
entering
into
details
though
i
have
abundant
material
respecting
my
own
experiences
of
my
first
in
the
first
two
of
a
series
of
one
hundred
letters
which
i
wrote
in
europe
as
correspondent
of
the
new
york
but
some
of
the
incidents
and
adventures
of
my
voyage
on
the
yorkshire
are
worth
transcribing
in
these
pages
of
my
personal
history
occasional
calms
and
adverse
winds
protracted
our
passage
to
nineteen
days
but
a
better
ship
and
a
more
competent
captain
never
sailed
i
was
entirely
exempt
from
and
enjoyed
the
voyage
very
much
good
fellowship
prevailed
among
the
passengers
the
time
passed
rapidly
and
we
had
a
good
deal
of
fun
on
board
several
of
the
passengers
were
english
merchants
from
canada
and
one
of
the
number
who
reckoned
himself
a
no
and
often
hinted
that
he
was
too
cute
for
any
yankee
boasted
so
much
of
his
shrewdness
that
a
yankee
friend
of
mine
confederated
with
me
to
test
it
i
thought
of
an
old
trick
and
arranged
with
my
friend
to
try
it
on
the
boastful
john
bull
coming
out
of
my
with
my
hand
to
my
face
and
apparently
in
great
pain
i
asked
my
fellow
passengers
what
was
good
for
the
my
friend
and
confederate
recommended
heating
tobacco
and
holding
it
to
my
face
i
therefore
borrowed
a
little
tobacco
and
putting
it
in
a
paper
of
a
peculiar
color
placed
it
on
the
stove
to
warm
i
then
retired
for
a
few
minutes
during
which
time
the
yankee
proposed
playing
a
trick
on
me
by
emptying
the
tobacco
and
filling
the
paper
with
ashes
which
our
smart
englishman
thought
would
be
a
very
fine
joke
and
he
himself
made
the
substitution
putting
ashes
into
the
paper
and
throwing
the
tobacco
into
the
fire
i
soon
reappeared
and
gravely
placed
the
paper
to
my
face
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
passengers
and
walked
up
and
down
the
cabin
as
if
i
was
suffering
terribly
at
the
further
end
of
the
cabin
i
slyly
exchanged
the
paper
for
another
in
my
pocket
of
the
same
color
and
containing
tobacco
and
then
walked
back
again
a
picture
of
misery
whereupon
the
merry
englishman
cried
out
mr
barnum
what
have
you
got
in
that
paper
tobacco
i
replied
what
will
you
bet
it
is
tobacco
said
the
englishman
oh
don
t
bother
me
said
i
my
tooth
pains
me
sadly
i
know
it
is
tobacco
for
i
put
it
there
i
ll
bet
you
a
dozen
of
champagne
that
it
is
not
tobacco
said
the
englishman
nonsense
i
replied
i
will
not
bet
for
it
would
not
be
fair
i
know
it
is
i
ll
bet
you
fifty
dollars
it
is
not
said
john
bull
and
he
counted
ten
sovereigns
upon
the
table
i
ll
not
bet
the
money
i
replied
for
i
tell
you
i
know
it
is
tobacco
i
placed
it
there
you
dare
not
bet
he
rejoined
at
last
merely
to
accommodate
him
i
bet
a
dozen
of
champagne
the
englishman
fairly
jumped
with
delight
and
roared
out
open
the
paper
open
the
paper
the
passengers
crowded
round
the
table
in
great
glee
to
see
me
open
the
paper
for
all
but
the
yankee
thought
i
was
taken
in
i
quietly
opened
the
paper
and
remarked
there
i
told
you
it
was
tobacco
how
foolish
you
were
to
suppose
it
was
not
for
as
i
told
you
i
put
it
there
the
passengers
my
confederate
excepted
were
amazed
and
the
englishman
was
absolutely
astounded
it
was
the
biter
bitten
but
he
told
the
steward
to
bring
the
champagne
and
turning
to
my
confederate
who
had
so
effectually
assisted
in
selling
him
he
pronounced
the
affair
a
contemptible
yankee
it
was
several
days
before
he
recovered
his
good
humor
but
he
joined
at
last
with
the
rest
of
us
in
laughing
at
the
joke
and
we
heard
no
more
about
his
extraordinary
shrewdness
on
our
arrival
at
liverpool
quite
a
crowd
had
assembled
at
the
dock
to
see
tom
thumb
for
it
had
been
previously
announced
that
he
would
arrive
in
the
yorkshire
but
his
mother
managed
to
smuggle
him
ashore
unnoticed
for
she
carried
him
as
if
he
was
an
infant
in
her
arms
we
went
to
the
waterloo
hotel
and
after
an
excellent
dinner
walked
out
to
take
a
look
at
the
town
while
i
was
viewing
the
nelson
monument
a
venerable
looking
old
gentleman
volunteered
to
explain
to
me
the
different
devices
and
inscriptions
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
disinterested
and
attentive
man
of
means
who
was
anxious
to
assist
a
stranger
and
to
show
his
courtesy
but
when
i
gave
him
a
parting
bow
of
thanks
half
ashamed
that
i
had
so
trespassed
on
his
kindness
he
put
out
the
hand
of
a
beggar
and
said
that
he
would
be
thankful
for
any
remuneration
i
saw
fit
to
bestow
upon
him
for
his
trouble
i
was
certainly
astonished
and
i
thrust
a
shilling
into
his
hand
and
walked
rapidly
away
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
a
tall
man
came
to
the
hotel
and
introduced
himself
to
me
as
a
brother
yankee
who
would
be
happy
in
pointing
out
the
many
wonders
in
liverpool
that
a
stranger
would
be
pleased
to
see
i
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
in
liverpool
and
he
replied
nearly
a
i
declined
his
proffered
services
abruptly
remarking
that
if
he
had
been
there
only
a
week
i
probably
knew
as
much
about
england
as
he
did
oh
said
he
you
are
mistaken
i
have
been
in
england
before
though
never
till
recently
in
what
part
of
england
i
inquired
opposite
niagara
falls
he
replied
i
spent
several
days
there
with
the
british
i
laughed
in
his
face
and
reminded
him
that
england
did
not
lie
opposite
niagara
falls
the
impudent
fellow
was
confused
for
a
moment
and
then
triumphantly
exclaimed
i
didn
t
mean
england
i
know
what
country
it
is
as
well
as
you
well
what
country
is
it
i
asked
quite
assured
that
he
did
not
know
great
britain
of
course
he
replied
it
is
needless
to
add
that
the
honor
of
his
company
as
a
guide
in
liverpool
was
declined
and
he
went
off
apparently
in
a
huff
because
his
abilities
were
not
appreciated
later
in
the
evening
the
proprietor
of
a
cheap
show
at
three
ha
pence
admission
called
upon
me
he
had
heard
of
the
arrival
of
the
great
american
curiosity
and
he
seized
the
earliest
opportunity
to
make
the
general
and
myself
the
magnificent
offer
of
ten
dollars
a
week
if
we
would
join
ourselves
to
his
already
remarkable
and
attractive
exhibition
i
could
not
but
think
that
dwarfs
must
be
literally
at
a
low
figure
in
england
and
my
prospects
were
gloomy
indeed
i
was
a
stranger
in
the
land
my
letters
of
introduction
had
not
been
delivered
beyond
my
own
little
circle
i
had
not
seen
a
friendly
face
nor
heard
a
familiar
voice
i
was
blue
homesick
almost
in
despair
next
morning
there
came
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
the
following
note
madame
celeste
presents
her
compliments
to
barnum
and
begs
to
say
that
her
private
box
is
quite
at
his
service
any
night
for
himself
and
friends
theatre
royal
williamson
this
polite
invitation
was
thankfully
accepted
and
we
went
to
the
theatre
that
evening
our
party
including
the
general
who
was
partly
concealed
by
his
tutor
s
cloak
occupied
celeste
s
box
and
in
the
box
adjoining
sat
an
english
lady
and
gentleman
whose
appearance
indicated
respectability
intelligence
and
wealth
the
general
s
interest
in
the
performance
attracted
their
attention
and
the
lady
remarked
to
me
what
an
child
you
have
he
appears
to
take
quite
an
interest
in
the
pardon
me
madam
said
i
this
is
not
a
child
this
is
general
tom
indeed
they
exclaimed
they
had
seen
the
announcements
of
our
visit
and
were
greatly
gratified
at
an
interview
with
the
pigmy
prodigy
they
at
once
advised
me
in
the
most
complimentary
and
urgent
manner
to
take
the
general
to
manchester
where
they
resided
assuring
me
that
an
exhibition
in
that
place
would
be
highly
remunerative
i
thanked
my
new
friends
for
their
counsel
and
encouragement
and
ventured
to
ask
them
what
price
they
would
recommend
me
to
charge
for
admission
the
general
is
so
decidedly
a
curiosity
said
the
lady
that
i
think
you
might
put
it
as
high
as
tuppence
she
was
however
promptly
interrupted
by
her
husband
who
was
evidently
the
economist
of
the
family
i
am
sure
you
would
not
succeed
at
that
price
said
he
you
should
put
admission
at
one
penny
for
that
is
the
usual
price
for
seeing
giants
and
dwarfs
in
this
was
worse
than
the
ten
dollars
a
week
offer
of
the
proprietor
but
i
promptly
answered
never
shall
the
price
be
less
than
one
shilling
sterling
and
some
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
england
will
yet
pay
gold
to
see
general
tom
my
letters
of
introduction
speedily
brought
me
into
friendly
relations
with
many
excellent
families
and
i
was
induced
to
hire
a
hall
and
present
the
general
to
the
public
for
a
short
season
in
liverpool
i
had
intended
to
proceed
directly
to
london
and
begin
operations
at
that
is
in
buckingham
palace
if
possible
but
i
had
been
advised
that
the
royal
family
was
in
mourning
for
the
death
of
prince
albert
s
father
and
would
not
permit
the
approach
of
any
entertainments
meanwhile
confidential
letters
from
london
informed
me
that
maddox
manager
of
princess
s
theatre
was
coming
down
to
witness
my
exhibition
with
a

making

engagement
he
came
privately
but
i
was
fully
informed
as
to
his
presence
and
object
a
friend
pointed
him
out
to
me
in
the
hall
and
when
i
stepped
up
to
him
and
called
him
by
name
he
was
taken
all
aback
and
avowed
his
purpose
in
visiting
liverpool
an
interview
resulted
in
an
engagement
of
the
general
for
three
nights
at
princess
s
theatre
i
was
unwilling
to
contract
for
a
longer
period
and
even
this
short
engagement
though
on
liberal
terms
was
acceded
to
only
as
a

advertisement

it

the

the

were
delighted

they

the

was
satisfied
because
he
had
coined
money
by

and
i
was
greatly
pleased
because
i
now
had
a
visible
guaranty
of
success
in
london
i
was
offered
far
higher
terms
for
a
but
my
purpose
had
been
already
answered
the
news
was
spread
everywhere
that
general
tom
thumb
an
unparalleled
curiosity
was
in
the
city
and
it
only
remained
for
me
to
bring
him
before
the
public
on
my
own
account
and
in
my
own
time
and
way
i
took
a
furnished
mansion
in
grafton
street
bond
street
west
end
in
the
very
centre
of
the
most
fashionable
locality
the
house
had
previously
been
occupied
for
several
years
by
lord
talbot
and
lord
brougham
and
half
a
dozen
families
of
the
aristocracy
and
many
of
the
gentry
were
my
neighbors
from
this
magnificent
mansion
i
sent
letters
of
invitation
to
the
editors
and
several
of
the
nobility
to
visit
the
general
most
of
them
called
and
were
highly
gratified
the
word
of
approval
was
indeed
so
passed
around
in
high
circles
that
uninvited
parties
drove
to
my
door
in
crested
carriages
and
were
not
admitted
this
procedure
though
in
some
measure
a
stroke
of
policy
was
neither
singular
nor
hazardous
under
the
circumstances
i
had
not
yet
announced
a
public
exhibition
and
as
a
private
american
gentleman
it
became
me
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
my
position
i
therefore
instructed
my
liveried
servant
to
deny
admission
to
see
my
ward
excepting
to
persons
who
brought
cards
of
invitation
he
did
it
in
a
proper
manner
and
no
offence
could
be
taken
though
i
was
always
particular
to
send
an
invitation
immediately
to
such
as
had
not
been
admitted
during
our
first
week
in
london
the
hon
edward
everett
the
american
minister
to
whom
i
had
letters
of
introduction
called
and
was
highly
pleased
with
his
diminutive
though
renowned
countryman
we
dined
with
him
the
next
day
by
invitation
and
his
family
loaded
the
young
american
with
presents
everett
kindly
promised
to
use
influence
at
the
palace
in
person
with
a
view
to
having
tom
thumb
introduced
to
her
majesty
queen
victoria
a
few
evenings
afterwards
the
baroness
rothschild
sent
her
carriage
for
us
her
mansion
is
a
noble
structure
in
piccadilly
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
through
the
gate
of
which
our
carriage
was
driven
and
brought
up
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
here
we
were
received
by
half
a
dozen
servants
and
were
ushered
up
the
broad
flight
of
marble
stairs
to
the
where
we
met
the
baroness
and
a
party
of
twenty
or
more
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
this
sumptuous
mansion
of
the
richest
banker
in
the
world
we
spent
about
two
hours
and
when
we
took
our
leave
a
purse
was
quietly
slipped
into
my
hand
the
golden
shower
had
begun
to
fall
and
that
it
was
no
dream
was
manifest
from
the
fact
that
very
shortly
afterwards
a
visit
to
the
mansion
of
drummond
another
eminent
banker
came
to
the
same
golden
conclusion
i
now
engaged
the
egyptian
hall
in
piccadilly
and
the
announcement
of
my
unique
exhibition
was
promptly
answered
by
a
rush
of
visitors
in
which
the
wealth
and
fashion
of
london
were
liberally
represented
i
made
these
arrangements
because
i
had
little
hope
of
being
soon
brought
to
the
queen
s
presence
for
the
reason
before
mentioned
but
everett
s
generous
influence
secured
my
object
i
breakfasted
at
his
house
one
morning
by
invitation
in
company
with
charles
murray
an
author
of
creditable
repute
who
held
the
office
of
master
of
the
queen
s
household
in
the
course
of
conversation
murray
inquired
as
to
my
plans
and
i
informed
him
that
i
intended
going
to
the
continent
shortly
though
i
should
be
glad
to
remain
if
the
general
could
have
an
interview
with
the
queen
adding
that
such
an
event
would
be
of
great
consequence
to
me
murray
kindly
offered
his
good
offices
in
the
case
and
the
next
day
one
of
the
life
guards
a
tall
fellow
bedecked
as
became
his
station
brought
me
a
note
conveying
the
queen
s
invitation
to
general
tom
thumb
and
his
guardian
barnum
to
appear
at
buckingham
palace
on
an
evening
specified
special
instructions
were
the
same
day
orally
given
me
by
murray
by
her
majesty
s
command
to
suffer
the
general
to
appear
before
her
as
he
would
appear
anywhere
else
without
any
training
in
the
use
of
the
titles
of
royalty
as
the
queen
desired
to
see
him
act
naturally
and
without
restraint
determined
to
make
the
most
of
the
occasion
i
put
a
placard
on
the
door
of
the
egyptian
hall
closed
this
evening
general
tom
thumb
being
at
buckingham
palace
by
command
of
her
on
arriving
at
the
palace
the
lord
in
waiting
put
me
under
drill
as
to
the
manner
and
form
in
which
i
should
conduct
myself
in
the
presence
of
royalty
i
was
to
answer
all
questions
by
her
majesty
through
him
and
in
no
event
to
speak
directly
to
the
queen
in
leaving
the
royal
presence
i
was
to
back
out
keeping
my
face
always
towards
her
majesty
and
the
illustrious
lord
kindly
gave
me
a
specimen
of
that
sort
of
backward
locomotion
how
far
i
profited
by
his
instructions
and
example
will
presently
appear
we
were
conducted
through
a
long
corridor
to
a
broad
flight
of
marble
steps
which
led
to
the
queen
s
magnificent
picture
gallery
where
her
majesty
and
prince
albert
the
duchess
of
kent
and
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
nobility
were
awaiting
our
arrival
they
were
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
when
the
doors
were
thrown
open
and
the
general
walked
in
looking
like
a
wax
doll
gifted
with
the
power
of
locomotion
surprise
and
pleasure
were
depicted
on
the
countenances
of
the
royal
circle
at
beholding
this
remarkable
specimen
of
humanity
so
much
smaller
than
they
had
evidently
expected
to
find
him
the
general
advanced
with
a
firm
step
and
as
he
came
within
hailing
distance
made
a
very
graceful
bow
and
exclaimed
good
evening
ladies
and
gentlemen
a
burst
of
laughter
followed
this
salutation
the
queen
then
took
him
by
the
hand
led
him
about
the
gallery
and
asked
him
many
questions
the
answers
to
which
kept
the
party
in
an
uninterrupted
strain
of
merriment
the
general
familiarly
informed
the
queen
that
her
picture
gallery
was
and
told
her
he
should
like
to
see
the
prince
of
wales
the
queen
replied
that
the
prince
had
retired
to
rest
but
that
he
should
see
him
on
some
future
occasion
the
general
then
gave
his
songs
dances
and
imitations
and
after
a
conversation
with
prince
albert
and
all
present
which
continued
for
more
than
an
hour
we
were
permitted
to
depart
before
describing
the
process
and
incidents
of
backing
out
i
must
acknowledge
how
sadly
i
broke
through
the
counsel
of
the
lord
in
waiting
while
prince
albert
and
others
were
engaged
with
the
general
the
queen
was
gathering
information
from
me
in
regard
to
his
history
etc
two
or
three
questions
were
put
and
answered
through
the
process
indicated
in
my
drill
it
was
a
way
of
doing
business
not
at
all
to
my
liking
and
i
suppose
the
lord
in
waiting
was
seriously
shocked
if
not
outraged
when
i
entered
directly
into
conversation
with
her
majesty
she
however
seemed
not
disposed
to
check
my
boldness
for
she
immediately
spoke
directly
to
me
in
obtaining
the
information
which
she
sought
i
felt
entirely
at
ease
in
her
presence
and
could
not
avoid
contrasting
her
sensible
and
amiable
manners
with
the
stiffness
and
formality
of
upstart
gentility
at
home
or
abroad
the
queen
was
modestly
attired
in
plain
black
and
wore
no
ornaments
indeed
surrounded
as
she
was
by
ladies
arrayed
in
the
highest
style
of
magnificence
their
dresses
sparkling
with
diamonds
she
was
the
last
person
whom
a
stranger
would
have
pointed
out
in
that
circle
as
the
queen
of
england
the
lord
in
waiting
was
perhaps
mollified
toward
me
when
he
saw
me
following
his
illustrious
example
in
retiring
from
the
royal
presence
he
was
accustomed
to
the
process
and
therefore
was
able
to
keep
somewhat
ahead
or
rather
aback
of
me
but
even
i
stepped
rather
fast
for
the
other
member
of
the
retiring
party
we
had
a
considerable
distance
to
travel
in
that
long
gallery
before
reaching
the
door
and
whenever
the
general
found
he
was
losing
ground
he
turned
around
and
ran
a
few
steps
then
resumed
the
position
of
backing
out
then
turned
around
and
ran
and
so
continued
to
alternate
his
methods
of
getting
to
the
door
until
the
gallery
fairly
rang
with
the
merriment
of
the
royal
spectators
it
was
really
one
of
the
richest
scenes
i
ever
saw
running
under
the
circumstances
was
an
offence
sufficiently
heinous
to
excite
the
indignation
of
the
queen
s
favorite
and
he
vented
his
displeasure
by
barking
so
sharply
as
to
startle
the
general
from
his
propriety
he
however
recovered
immediately
and
with
his
little
cane
commenced
an
attack
on
the
poodle
and
a
funny
fight
ensued
which
renewed
and
increased
the
merriment
of
the
royal
party
this
was
near
the
door
of
exit
we
had
scarcely
passed
into
the
when
one
of
the
queen
s
attendants
came
to
us
with
the
expressed
hope
of
her
majesty
that
the
general
had
sustained
no
damage
to
which
the
lord
in
waiting
playfully
added
that
in
case
of
injury
to
so
renowned
a
personage
he
should
fear
a
declaration
of
war
by
the
united
states
the
courtesies
of
the
palace
were
not
yet
exhausted
for
we
were
escorted
to
an
apartment
in
which
refreshments
had
been
provided
for
us
we
did
ample
justice
to
the
viands
though
my
mind
was
rather
looking
into
the
future
than
enjoying
the
present
i
was
anxious
that
the
court
journal
of
the
ensuing
day
should
contain
more
than
a
mere
line
in
relation
to
the
general
s
interview
with
the
queen
and
on
inquiry
i
learned
that
the
gentleman
who
had
charge
of
that
feature
in
the
daily
papers
was
then
in
the
palace
he
was
sent
for
by
my
solicitation
and
promptly
acceded
to
my
request
for
such
a
notice
as
would
attract
attention
he
even
generously
desired
me
to
give
him
an
outline
of
what
i
sought
and
i
was
pleased
to
see
afterwards
that
he
had
inserted
my
notice
this
notice
of
my
visit
to
the
queen
wonderfully
increased
the
attraction
of
my
exhibition
and
compelled
me
to
obtain
a
more
commodious
hall
for
my
exhibition
i
accordingly
removed
to
the
larger
room
in
the
same
building
for
some
time
previously
occupied
by
our
countryman
catlin
for
his
great
gallery
of
portraits
of
american
indians
and
indian
curiosities
all
of
which
remained
as
an
adornment
on
our
second
visit
to
the
queen
we
were
received
in
what
is
called
the
yellow
a
magnificent
apartment
surpassing
in
splendor
and
gorgeousness
anything
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
it
is
on
the
north
side
of
the
gallery
and
is
entered
from
that
apartment
it
was
hung
with
drapery
of
rich
yellow
satin
damask
the
couches
sofas
and
chairs
being
covered
with
the
same
material
the
vases
urns
and
ornaments
were
all
of
modern
patterns
and
the
most
exquisite
workmanship
the
room
was
panelled
in
gold
and
the
heavy
cornices
beautifully
carved
and
gilt
the
tables
pianos
were
mounted
with
gold
inlaid
with
pearl
of
various
hues
and
of
the
most
elegant
designs
we
were
ushered
into
this
gorgeous
before
the
queen
and
royal
circle
had
left
the
and
as
they
approached
the
general
bowed
respectfully
and
remarked
to
her
majesty
that
he
had
seen
her
before
adding
i
think
this
is
a
prettier
room
than
the
picture
gallery
that
chandelier
is
very
the
queen
smilingly
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
she
hoped
he
was
very
well
yes
ma
am
he
replied
i
am
first
general
continued
the
queen
this
is
the
prince
of
how
are
you
prince
said
the
general
shaking
him
by
the
hand
and
then
standing
beside
the
prince
he
remarked
the
prince
is
taller
than
i
am
but
i
feel
as
big
as
anybody
upon
which
he
strutted
up
and
down
the
room
as
proud
as
a
peacock
amid
shouts
of
laughter
from
all
present
the
queen
then
introduced
the
princess
royal
and
the
general
immediately
led
her
to
his
elegant
little
sofa
which
we
took
with
us
and
with
much
politeness
sat
himself
down
beside
her
then
rising
from
his
seat
he
went
through
his
various
performances
and
the
queen
handed
him
an
elegant
and
costly
souvenir
which
had
been
expressly
made
for
him
by
her
order
for
which
he
told
her
he
was
very
much
obliged
and
would
keep
it
as
long
as
he
the
queen
of
the
belgians
daughter
of
louis
philippe
was
present
on
this
occasion
she
asked
the
general
where
he
was
going
when
he
left
london
to
paris
he
replied
whom
do
you
expect
to
see
there
she
continued
of
course
all
expected
he
would
answer
the
king
of
the
french
but
the
little
fellow
replied
i
shall
see
monsieur
guillaudeu
in
the
two
queens
looked
inquiringly
to
me
and
when
i
informed
them
that
guillaudeu
was
my
french
naturalist
who
had
preceded
me
to
paris
they
laughed
most
heartily
on
our
third
visit
to
buckingham
palace
leopold
king
of
the
belgians
was
also
present
he
was
highly
pleased
and
asked
a
multitude
of
questions
queen
victoria
desired
the
general
to
sing
a
song
and
asked
him
what
song
he
preferred
to
sing
yankee
doodle
was
the
prompt
reply
this
answer
was
as
unexpected
to
me
as
it
was
to
the
royal
party
when
the
merriment
it
occasioned
somewhat
subsided
the
queen
remarked
that
is
a
very
pretty
song
general
sing
it
if
you
the
general
complied
and
soon
afterwards
we
retired
i
ought
to
add
that
after
each
of
our
three
visits
to
buckingham
palace
a
very
handsome
sum
was
sent
to
me
of
course
by
the
queen
s
command
this
however
was
the
smallest
part
of
the
advantage
derived
from
these
interviews
as
will
be
at
once
apparent
to
all
who
consider
the
force
of
court
example
in
england
the
british
public
were
now
fairly
excited
not
to
have
seen
general
tom
thumb
was
decidedly
unfashionable
and
from
march
until
july
the
levees
of
the
little
general
at
egyptian
hall
were
continually
crowded
the
receipts
averaging
during
the
whole
period
about
five
hundred
dollars
per
day
and
sometimes
going
considerably
beyond
that
sum
at
the
fashionable
hour
between
fifty
and
sixty
carriages
of
the
nobility
have
been
counted
at
one
time
standing
in
front
of
our
exhibition
rooms
in
piccadilly
portraits
of
the
little
general
were
published
in
all
the
pictorial
papers
of
the
time
polkas
and
quadrilles
were
named
after
him
and
songs
were
sung
in
his
praise
he
was
an
almost
constant
theme
for
the
london
which
served
up
the
general
and
myself
so
daintily
that
it
no
doubt
added
vastly
to
our
receipts
besides
his
three
public
performances
per
day
the
little
general
attended
from
three
to
four
private
parties
per
week
for
which
we
were
paid
eight
to
ten
guineas
each
frequently
we
would
visit
two
parties
in
the
same
evening
and
the
demand
in
that
line
was
much
greater
than
the
supply
the
queen
dowager
adelaide
requested
the
general
s
attendance
at
marlborough
house
one
afternoon
he
went
in
his
court
dress
consisting
of
a
richly
embroidered
brown
coat
and
short
breeches
white
satin
vest
with
embroidery
white
silk
stockings
and
pumps
wig
cocked
hat
and
a
dress
sword
why
general
said
the
queen
dowager
i
think
you
look
very
smart
i
guess
i
do
said
the
general
complacently
a
large
party
of
the
nobility
were
present
the
old
duke
of
cambridge
offered
the
little
general
a
pinch
of
snuff
which
he
declined
the
general
sang
his
songs
performed
his
dances
and
cracked
his
jokes
to
the
great
amusement
and
delight
of
the
distinguished
circle
of
visitors
dear
little
general
said
the
queen
taking
him
upon
her
lap
i
see
you
have
got
no
watch
will
you
permit
me
to
present
you
with
a
watch
and
chain
i
would
like
them
very
much
replied
the
general
his
eyes
glistening
with
joy
as
he
spoke
i
will
have
them
made
expressly
for
you
responded
the
queen
dowager
and
at
the
same
moment
she
called
a
friend
and
desired
him
to
see
that
the
proper
order
was
executed
a
few
weeks
thereafter
we
were
called
again
to
marlborough
house
a
number
of
the
children
of
the
nobility
were
present
as
well
as
some
of
their
parents
after
passing
a
few
compliments
with
the
general
queen
adelaide
presented
him
with
a
beautiful
little
gold
watch
placing
the
chain
around
his
neck
with
her
own
hands
the
little
fellow
was
delighted
and
scarcely
knew
how
sufficiently
to
express
his
thanks
the
good
queen
gave
him
some
excellent
advice
in
regard
to
his
morals
which
he
strictly
promised
to
obey
after
giving
his
performances
we
withdrew
from
the
royal
presence
and
the
elegant
little
watch
presented
by
the
hands
of
her
majesty
the
queen
dowager
was
not
only
duly
heralded
but
was
also
placed
upon
a
pedestal
in
the
hall
of
exhibition
together
with
the
presents
from
queen
victoria
and
covered
with
a
glass
vase
these
presents
to
which
were
soon
added
an
elegant
gold
mounted
with
turquoise
presented
by
his
grace
the
duke
of
devonshire
and
many
other
costly
gifts
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
added
greatly
to
the
attractions
of
the
exhibition
the
duke
of
wellington
called
frequently
to
see
the
little
general
at
his
public
levees
the
first
time
he
called
the
general
was
personating
napoleon
bonaparte
marching
up
and
down
the
platform
and
apparently
taking
snuff
in
deep
meditation
he
was
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
the
emperor
i
introduced
him
to
the
iron
duke
who
inquired
the
subject
of
his
meditations
i
was
thinking
of
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
was
the
little
general
s
immediate
reply
this
display
of
wit
was
chronicled
throughout
the
country
and
was
of
itself
worth
thousands
of
pounds
to
the
exhibition
while
we
were
in
london
the
emperor
nicholas
of
russia
visited
queen
victoria
and
i
saw
him
on
several
public
occasions
i
was
present
at
the
grand
review
of
troops
in
windsor
park
in
honor
of
and
before
the
emperor
of
russia
and
the
king
of
saxony
general
tom
thumb
had
visited
the
king
of
saxony
and
also
ibrahim
pacha
who
was
then
in
london
at
the
different
parties
we
attended
we
met
in
the
course
of
the
season
nearly
all
of
the
nobility
i
do
not
believe
that
a
single
nobleman
in
england
failed
to
see
general
tom
thumb
at
his
own
house
at
the
house
of
a
friend
or
at
the
public
levees
at
egyptian
hall
the
general
was
a
decided
pet
with
some
of
the
first
personages
in
the
land
among
whom
may
be
mentioned
sir
robert
and

we
had
the
free
entrÃ©e
to
all
the
theatres
public
gardens
and
places
of
entertainment
and
frequently
met
the
principal
artists
editors
poets
and
authors
of
the
country
albert
smith
was
a
particular
friend
of
mine
he
wrote
a
play
for
the
general
entitled

which
was
presented
with
great
success
at
the
lyceum

london
and
in
several
of
the
provincial

our
visit
in

and

enormously
successful

i

alone
to
arrange
the
preliminaries
for
our
campaign
in
that
city
paris
was
not
altogether
a
strange
place
to
me
months
before
when
i
had
successfully
established
my
exhibition
in
london
i
ran
over
to
paris
to
see
what
i
could
pick
up
in
the
way
of
curiosities
for
my
museum
in
new
york
for
during
my
whole
sojourn
abroad
and
amid
all
the
excitements
of
my
new
career
i
never
forgot
the
interests
of
my
many
and
generous
patrons
at
home
the
occasion
which
first
called
me
to
france
was
the
quinquennial
exposition
in
paris
at
that
time
there
was
an
assemblage
every
five
years
of
inventors
and
manufacturers
who
exhibited
specimens
of
their
skill
especially
in
articles
of
curious
and
ingenious
mechanism
and
i
went
from
london
mainly
to
attend
this
exposition
there
i
met
and
became
well
acquainted
with
robert
houdin
the
celebrated
conjurer
he
was
a
watchmaker
by
trade
but
very
soon
displayed
a
wonderful
ability
and
ingenuity
which
he
devoted
with
so
much
assiduity
to
the
construction
of
a
complicated
machine
that
he
lost
all
mental
power
for
a
considerable
period
when
he
recovered
he
employed
himself
with
great
success
in
the
manufacture
of
mechanical
toys
and
automata
which
attracted
much
attention
and
afterwards
he
visited
great
britain
and
other
countries
giving
a
series
of
juggling
exhibitions
which
were
famous
throughout
europe
at
this
quinquennial
exposition
which
i
attended
he
received
a
gold
medal
for
his
automata
and
the
best
figure
which
he
had
on
exhibition
i
purchased
at
a
good
round
price
it
was
an
automaton
writer
and
artist
a
most
ingenious
little
figure
which
sat
at
a
table
and
readily
answered
with
the
pencil
certain
questions
for
instance
if
asked
for
an
emblem
of
fidelity
the
figure
instantly
drew
a
correct
picture
of
a
handsome
dog
the
emblem
of
love
was
shown
in
an
exquisite
drawing
of
a
little
cupid
the
automaton
would
also
answer
many
questions
in
writing
i
carried
this
curious
figure
to
london
and
exhibited
it
for
some
time
in
the
royal
adelaide
gallery
and
then
sent
it
across
the
atlantic
to
the
american
museum
during
my
very
brief
visit
to
paris
houdin
was
giving
evening
performances
in
the
palais
royale
in
legerdemain
and
i
was
frequently
present
by
invitation
houdin
also
took
pains
to
introduce
me
to
other
inventors
of
moving
figures
which
i
purchased
freely
and
made
a
prominent
feature
in
my
museum
attractions
i
managed
too
during
my
short
stay
to
see
something
of
the
surface
of
the
finest
city
in
the
world
and
now
going
to
paris
the
second
time
i
was
very
fortunate
in
making
the
acquaintance
of
dion
boucicault
who
was
then
temporarily
sojourning
in
that
city
and
who
at
once
kindly
volunteered
to
advise
and
assist
me
in
regard
to
numerous
matters
of
importance
relating
to
the
approaching
visit
of
the
general
he
spent
a
day
with
me
in
the
search
for
suitable
accommodations
for
my
company
and
by
giving
me
the
benefit
of
his
experience
he
saved
me
much
trouble
and
expense
i
have
never
forgotten
the
courtesy
extended
to
me
by
this
gentleman
i
stopped
at
the
hotel
bedford
and
securing
an
interpreter
began
to
make
my
arrangements
the
first
difficulty
in
the
way
was
the
government
tax
for
exhibiting
natural
curiosities
which
was
no
less
than
of
the
gross
receipts
while
theatres
paid
only
eleven
per
cent
this
tax
was
appropriated
to
the
benefit
of
the
city
hospitals
now
i
knew
from
my
experience
in
london
that
my
receipts
would
be
so
large
as
to
make
per
cent
of
them
a
far
more
serious
tax
than
i
thought
i
ought
to
pay
to
the
french
government
even
for
the
benefit
of
the
admirable
hospitals
of
paris
accordingly
i
went
to
the
license
bureau
and
had
an
interview
with
the
chief
i
told
him
i
was
anxious
to
bring
a
dwarf
to
paris
but
that
the
percentage
to
be
paid
for
a
license
was
so
large
as
to
deter
me
from
bringing
him
but
letting
the
usual
rule
go
what
should
i
give
him
in
advance
for
a
two
months
license
my
dear
sir
he
answered
you
had
better
not
come
at
all
these
things
never
draw
and
you
will
do
nothing
or
so
little
that
the
percentage
need
not
trouble
i
expressed
my
willingness
to
try
the
experiment
and
offered
one
thousand
francs
in
advance
for
a
license
the
chief
would
not
consent
and
i
then
offered
two
thousand
francs
this
opened
his
eyes
to
a
chance
for
a
speculation
and
he
jumped
at
my
offer
he
would
do
it
on
his
own
account
he
said
and
pay
the
amount
of
of
my
receipts
to
the
hospitals
he
was
perfectly
safe
in
making
such
a
contract
he
thought
for
he
had
francs
in
bank
but
i
declined
to
arrange
this
with
him
individually
so
he
called
his
associates
together
and
presented
the
matter
in
such
a
way
that
the
board
took
my
offer
on
behalf
of
the
government
i
paid
down
the
francs
and
received
a
good
strong
contract
and
license
the
chief
was
quite
elated
and
handed
me
the
license
with
the
remark
now
we
have
made
an
agreement
and
if
you
do
not
exhibit
or
if
your
dwarf
dies
during
the
two
months
you
shall
not
get
back
your
all
right
thought
i
if
you
are
satisfied
i
am
sure
i
have
every
reason
to
be
i
then
hired
at
a
large
rent
the
salle
musard
rue
vivienne
in
a
central
and
fashionable
quarter
close
by
the
boulevards
and
engaged
an
interpreter
and
a
small
but
excellent
orchestra
in
fact
i
made
the
most
complete
arrangements
even
to
starting
the
preliminary
paragraphs
in
the
paris
papers
and
after
calling
on
the
honorable
william
rufus
king
the
united
states
minister
at
the
court
of
france
who
assured
me
that
after
my
success
in
london
there
would
be
no
difficulty
whatever
in
my
presentation
to
king
louis
philippe
and
family
i
returned
to
england
i
went
back
to
paris
with
general
tom
thumb
and
party
some
time
before
i
intended
to
begin
my
exhibitions
and
on
the
very
day
after
my
arrival
i
received
a
special
command
to
appear
at
the
tuileries
on
the
following
sunday
evening
it
will
be
remembered
that
louis
philippe
s
daughter
the
wife
of
king
leopold
of
belgium
had
seen
the
general
at
buckingham
palace
a
fact
that
had
been
duly
chronicled
in
the
french
as
well
as
english
papers
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
had
privately
expressed
her
gratification
at
seeing
him
with
this
advantage
and
with
the
prestige
of
our
receptions
by
queen
victoria
and
prince
albert
we
went
to
the
tuileries
with
full
confidence
that
our
visit
and
reception
would
be
entirely
satisfactory
at
the
appointed
hour
the
general
and
i
arrayed
in
the
conventional
court
costume
were
ushered
into
a
grand
saloon
of
the
palace
where
we
were
introduced
to
the
king
the
queen
princess
adelaide
the
duchess
d
orleans
and
her
son
the
count
de
paris
prince
de
joinville
duke
and
duchess
de
nemours
the
duchess
d
aumale
and
a
dozen
or
more
distinguished
persons
among
whom
was
the
editor
of
the
official
des
the
court
circle
entered
into
conversation
with
us
without
restraint
and
were
greatly
delighted
with
the
little
general
king
louis
philippe
was
minute
in
his
inquiries
about
my
country
and
talked
freely
about
his
experiences
when
he
wandered
as
an
exile
in
america
he
playfully
alluded
to
the
time
when
he
earned
his
living
as
a
tutor
and
said
he
had
roughed
it
generally
and
had
even
slept
in
indian
wigwams
general
tom
thumb
then
went
through
with
his
various
performances
to
the
manifest
pleasure
of
all
who
were
present
and
at
the
close
the
king
presented
to
him
a
large
emerald
brooch
set
with
diamonds
the
general
expressed
his
gratitude
and
the
king
turning
to
me
said
you
may
put
it
on
the
general
if
you
please
which
i
did
to
the
evident
gratification
of
the
king
as
well
as
the
general
king
louis
philippe
was
so
condescending
and
courteous
that
i
felt
quite
at
home
in
the
royal
presence
and
ventured
upon
a
bit
of
diplomacy
the
longchamps
celebration
was
coming
a
day
once
devoted
to
religious
ceremony
but
now
conspicuous
for
the
display
of
court
and
fashionable
equipages
in
the
champs
Ã©lysÃ©es
and
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
as
the
king
was
familiarly
conversing
with
me
i
ventured
to
say
that
i
had
hurried
over
to
paris
to
take
part
in
the
longchamps
display
and
i
asked
him
if
the
general
s
carriage
could
not
be
permitted
to
appear
in
the
avenue
reserved
for
the
court
and
the
diplomatic
corps
representing
that
the
general
s
small
but
elegant
establishment
with
its
ponies
and
little
coachman
and
footman
would
be
in
danger
of
damage
in
the
general
throng
unless
the
special
privilege
i
asked
was
accorded
the
king
smilingly
turned
to
one
of
the
officers
of
his
household
and
after
conversing
with
him
for
a
few
moments
he
said
to
me
call
on
the
prefect
of
police
afternoon
and
you
will
find
a
permit
ready
for
our
visit
occupied
two
hours
and
when
we
went
away
the
general
was
loaded
with
fine
presents
the
next
morning
all
the
newspapers
noticed
the
visit
and
the
des
gave
a
minute
account
of
the
interview
and
of
the
general
s
performances
taking
occasion
to
say
in
speaking
of
the
character
parts
that
there
was
one
costume
which
the
general
wisely
kept
at
the
bottom
of
his
that
costume
however
the
uniform
of
bonaparte
was
once
exhibited
by
particular
request
as
will
be
seen
anon
longchamps
day
arrived
and
among
the
many
splendid
equipages
on
the
grand
avenue
none
attracted
more
attention
than
the
superb
little
carriage
with
four
ponies
and
liveried
and
powdered
coachman
and
footman
belonging
to
the
general
and
conspicuous
in
the
line
of
carriages
containing
the
ambassadors
to
the
court
of
france
thousands
upon
thousands
rent
the
air
with
cheers
for
general
tom
there
never
was
such
an
advertisement
the
journals
next
day
made
elaborate
notices
of
the
turnout
and
thereafter
whenever
the
general
s
carriage
appeared
on
the
boulevards
as
it
did
daily
the
people
flocked
to
the
doors
of
the
cafÃ©s
and
shops
to
see
it
pass
thus
before
i
opened
the
exhibition
all
paris
knew
that
general
tom
thumb
was
in
the
city
the
french
are
exceedingly
impressible
and
what
in
london
is
only
excitement
in
paris
becomes
furor
under
this
pressure
with
the
prestige
of
my
first
visit
to
the
tuileries
and
the
numberless
paragraphs
in
the
papers
i
opened
my
doors
to
an
eager
throng
the
Ã©lite
of
the
city
came
to
the
exhibition
the
first
day
s
receipts
were
francs
which
would
have
been
doubled
if
i
could
have
made
room
for
more
patrons
there
were
afternoon
and
evening
performances
and
from
that
day
secured
seats
at
an
extra
price
were
engaged
in
advance
for
the
entire
two
months
the
season
was
more
than
a
success
it
was
a
triumph
it
seemed
too
as
if
the
whole
city
was
advertising
me
the
papers
were
profuse
in
their
praises
of
the
general
and
his
performances
the
of
illustration
honors
to
the
paris
gave
a
picture
of
an
immense
mastiff
running
away
with
the
general
s
carriage
and
horses
in
his
mouth
statuettes
of
tom
pouce
appeared
in
all
the
windows
in
plaster
parian
sugar
and
chocolate
songs
were
written
about
him
and
his
lithograph
was
seen
everywhere
a
fine
cafÃ©
on
one
of
the
boulevards
took
the
name
of
tom
pouce
and
displayed
over
the
door
a
statue
of
the
general
in
paris
as
in
london
several
eminent
painters
expressed
their
desire
to
paint
his
portrait
but
the
general
s
engagements
were
so
pressing
that
he
found
little
time
to
sit
to
artists
all
the
leading
actors
and
actresses
came
to
the
general
s
levees
and
petted
him
and
made
him
many
presents
meanwhile
the
daily
receipts
continued
to
swell
and
i
was
compelled
to
take
a
cab
to
carry
my
bag
of
silver
home
at
night
the
official
who
had
compromised
with
me
for
a
two
months
license
at
francs
was
amazed
as
well
as
annoyed
at
the
success
of
my
he
came
or
sent
a
man
to
the
levees
to
take
account
of
the
receipts
and
every
additional
thousand
francs
gave
him
an
additional
twinge
he
seriously
appealed
to
me
to
give
him
more
money
but
when
i
reminded
him
of
the
excellent
bargain
he
supposed
he
was
making
especially
when
he
added
the
conditional
clause
that
i
should
forfeit
the
francs
if
i
did
not
exhibit
or
if
the
general
died
he
smiled
faintly
and
said
something
about
a
yankee
i
asked
him
if
he
would
renew
our
agreement
for
two
months
more
on
the
same
terms
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
no
monsieur
barnum
you
will
pay
me
per
cent
of
your
receipts
when
the
two
months
of
our
contract
but
i
did
not
for
i
appealed
to
the
authorities
claiming
that
i
should
pay
only
the
ordinary
theatrical
tax
since
the
general
s
exhibition
consisted
chiefly
of
character
imitations
in
various
costumes
and
he
was
more
attractive
as
an
actor
than
as
a
natural
curiosity
my
view
of
the
case
was
decided
to
be
correct
and
thereafter
in
paris
and
throughout
france
with
few
exceptions
i
paid
only
the
eleven
per
cent
theatrical
tax
indeed
in
paris
the
general
made
a
great
hit
as
an
actor
and
was
elected
a
member
of
the
french
dramatic
society
besides
holding
his
levees
he
appeared
every
night
at
the
vaudeville
theatre
in
a
french
play
entitled
petit
poucet
and
written
expressly
for
him
and
he
afterwards
repeated
the
part
with
great
success
in
other
cities
the
demands
upon
our
time
were
incessant
we
were
invited
everywhere
to
dinners
and
entertainments
and
as
many
of
these
were
understood
to
be
private
performances
of
the
general
we
were
most
liberally
remunerated
therefor
galignani
invited
us
to
a
soiree
and
introduced
us
to
some
of
the
most
prominent
personages
including
artists
actors
and
editors
in
paris
the
general
was
frequently
engaged
at
a
large
price
to
show
himself
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
some
fancy
or
charitable
fair
and
much
money
was
made
in
this
way
on
sundays
he
was
employed
at
one
or
another
of
the
great
gardens
in
the
outskirts
and
thus
was
seen
by
thousands
of
working
people
who
could
not
attend
his
levees
all
classes
became
acquainted
with
tom
we
were
commanded
to
appear
twice
more
at
the
tuileries
and
we
were
also
invited
to
the
palace
on
the
king
s
birthday
to
witness
the
display
of
fireworks
in
honor
of
the
anniversary
our
fourth
and
last
visit
to
the
royal
family
was
by
special
invitation
at
st
cloud
on
each
occasion
we
met
nearly
the
same
persons
but
the
visit
to
st
cloud
was
by
far
the
most
interesting
of
our
interviews
on
this
one
occasion
and
by
the
special
request
of
the
king
the
general
personated
napoleon
bonaparte
in
full
costume
louis
philippe
had
heard
of
the
general
in
this
character
and
particularly
desired
to
see
him
but
the
affair
was
quite
on
the
sly
and
no
mention
was
made
of
it
in
the
papers
particularly
in
the
des
which
thought
no
doubt
that
costume
was
still
at
the
bottom
of
the
general
s
we
remained
an
hour
and
at
parting
each
of
the
royal
company
gave
the
general
a
splendid
present
almost
smothered
him
with
kisses
wished
him
a
safe
journey
through
france
and
a
long
and
happy
life
after
bidding
them
adieu
we
retired
to
another
portion
of
the
palace
to
make
a
change
of
the
general
s
costume
and
to
partake
of
some
refreshments
which
were
prepared
for
us
half
an
hour
afterwards
as
we
were
about
leaving
the
palace
we
went
through
a
hall
leading
to
the
front
door
and
in
doing
so
passed
the
in
which
the
royal
family
were
spending
the
evening
the
door
was
open
and
some
of
them
happening
to
espy
the
general
called
out
for
him
to
come
in
and
shake
hands
with
them
once
more
we
entered
the
apartment
and
there
found
the
ladies
sitting
around
a
square
table
each
provided
with
two
candles
and
every
one
of
them
including
the
queen
was
engaged
in
working
at
embroidery
while
a
young
lady
was
reading
aloud
for
their
edification
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
believe
this
is
a
sight
seldom
seen
in
families
of
the
aristocracy
on
either
side
of
the
water
at
the
church
fairs
in
paris
i
had
frequently
seen
pieces
of
embroidery
for
sale
which
were
labelled
as
having
been
presented
and
worked
by
the
duchess
d
orleans
princess
adelaide
duchess
de
nemours
and
other
titled
ladies
we
also
visited
by
invitation
the
napoleon
school
for
young
ladies
established
by
the
first
napoleon
at
denis
five
miles
north
of
paris
and
the
general
greatly
delighted
the
old
pensioners
at
the
invalides
by
calling
upon
them
and
shaking
many
of
them
by
the
hand
if
the
general
could
have
been
permitted
to
present
to
these
survivors
of
waterloo
his
representation
of
their
chief
and
emperor
he
would
have
aroused
their
enthusiasm
as
well
as
admiration
on
the
fourth
of
july
i
was
in
grenelle
outside
the
barriers
of
paris
when
i
remembered
that
i
had
the
address
of
monsieur
regnier
an
eminent
mechanician
who
lived
in
the
vicinity
wishing
to
purchase
a
variety
of
instruments
such
as
he
manufactured
i
called
at
his
residence
he
received
me
very
politely
and
i
soon
was
deeply
interested
in
this
intelligent
and
learned
man
he
was
a
member
of
many
scientific
institutions
was
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honor
etc
while
he
was
busy
in
making
out
my
bill
i
was
taking
a
cursory
view
of
the
various
plates
drawings
which
adorned
his
walls
when
my
eyes
fell
on
a
portrait
which
was
familiar
to
me
i
was
certain
that
i
could
not
be
mistaken
and
on
approaching
nearer
it
proved
to
be
as
i
expected
the
engraved
portrait
of
benjamin
franklin
it
was
placed
in
a
glazed
frame
and
on
the
outside
of
the
glass
were
arranged
thirteen
stars
made
of
metal
forming
a
half
circle
round
his
head
ah
i
exclaimed
i
see
you
have
here
a
portrait
of
my
yes
replied
regnier
and
he
was
a
great
and
an
excellent
man
when
he
was
in
paris
in
he
was
honored
and
respected
by
all
who
knew
him
and
by
none
more
so
than
by
the
scientific
portion
of
the
community
at
that
time
franklin
was
invited
by
the
president
of
the
society
of
emulation
to
decide
upon
the
merits
of
various
works
of
art
submitted
for
inspection
and
he
awarded
my
father
for
a
complicated
lock
the
prize
of
a
gold
medal
while
my
father
was
with
him
at
his
hotel
a
young
quaker
called
upon
the
doctor
he
was
a
total
stranger
to
franklin
but
at
once
proceeded
to
inform
him
that
he
had
come
to
paris
on
business
had
unfortunately
lost
all
his
money
and
wished
to
borrow
six
hundred
francs
to
enable
him
to
return
to
his
family
in
philadelphia
franklin
inquired
his
family
name
and
upon
hearing
it
immediately
counted
out
the
money
gave
the
young
stranger
some
excellent
advice
and
bade
him
adieu
my
father
was
struck
by
the
generosity
of
franklin
and
as
soon
as
the
young
man
had
departed
he
told
the
doctor
that
he
was
astonished
to
see
him
so
free
with
his
money
to
a
stranger
that
people
did
not
do
business
in
that
way
in
paris
and
what
he
considered
very
careless
was
that
franklin
took
no
receipt
not
even
a
scratch
of
a
pen
from
the
young
man
franklin
replied
that
he
always
felt
a
duty
and
pleasure
in
relieving
his
and
especially
in
this
case
as
he
knew
the
family
and
they
were
honest
and
worthy
persons
my
father
himself
a
generous
man
continued
regnier
was
affected
nearly
to
tears
and
begged
the
doctor
to
present
him
with
his
portrait
he
did
so
and
this
is
it
my
father
has
been
dead
some
years
he
bequeathed
the
portrait
to
me
and
there
is
not
money
enough
in
paris
to
buy
i
need
not
say
that
i
was
delighted
with
this
recital
i
remarked
to
regnier
that
he
should
double
the
number
of
stars
as
we
now
in
had
states
instead
of
thirteen
the
original
number
i
am
aware
of
that
he
replied
but
i
do
not
like
to
touch
the
work
which
was
left
by
my
father
i
hold
it
sacred
and
added
he
i
suppose
you
are
not
aware
of
the
uses
we
make
of
these
stars
assuring
him
in
the
negative
those
stars
said
he
are
made
of
steel
and
on
the
night
of
every
anniversary
of
american
independence
which
is
this
night
it
was
always
the
practice
of
my
father
and
will
always
be
mine
to
collect
our
family
and
children
together
darken
the
room
and
by
means
of
electricity
these
stars
which
are
connected
are
lighted
up
and
the
portrait
illuminated
by
electricity
franklin
s
favorite
science
thus
forming
a
halo
of
glory
about
his
head
and
doing
honor
to
the
name
of
a
man
whose
fame
should
be
perpetuated
to
in
continuing
the
conversation
i
found
that
this
good
old
gentleman
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
history
of
america
and
he
spoke
feelingly
of
what
he
believed
to
be
the
high
and
proud
destiny
of
our
republic
he
insisted
on
my
remaining
to
supper
and
witnessing
his
electrical
illumination
need
i
say
that
i
accepted
the
invitation
could
an
american
refuse
we
partook
of
a
substantial
supper
upon
which
the
good
old
gentleman
invoked
the
blessing
of
our
father
in
heaven
and
at
the
conclusion
he
returned
hearty
thanks
at
nine
o
clock
the
children
and
family
of
regnier
and
his
were
called
in
the
room
was
darkened
the
electrical
battery
was
charged
and
the
wire
touched
to
one
of
the
outer
stars
the
whole
thirteen
became
instantly
bright
as
fire
and
a
beautiful
effect
was
produced
what
more
simple
and
yet
beautiful
and
appropriate
manner
could
be
chosen
to
honor
the
memory
of
franklin
and
what
an
extraordinary
coincidence
it
was
that
i
a
total
stranger
in
paris
should
meet
such
a
singular
man
as
regnier
at
all
and
more
especially
on
that
day
of
days
the
anniversary
of
our
independence
at
ten
o
clock
i
took
my
leave
of
this
worthy
family
but
not
till
we
had
all
joined
in
the
following
toast
proposed
by
regnier
washington
franklin
and
lafayette
heroes
philosophers
patriots
and
honest
men
may
their
names
stand
brightest
on
the
list
of
earthly
glory
when
in
after
ages
this
whole
world
shall
be
one
universal
republic
and
every
individual
under
heaven
shall
acknowledge
the
truth
that
man
is
capable
of
it
will
not
be
considered
surprising
that
i
should
feel
at
home
with
monsieur
regnier
both
the
day
and
the
man
conspired
to
excite
and
gratify
my
patriotism
and
the
presence
of
franklin
my
love
of
my
native
land
during
my
stay
in
paris
a
russian
prince
who
had
been
living
in
great
splendor
in
that
city
suddenly
died
and
his
household
and
personal
effects
were
sold
at
auction
i
attended
the
sale
for
several
days
in
succession
buying
many
articles
of
vertu
and
among
others
a
magnificent
gold
and
a
silver
and
many
rare
specimens
of
sevres
china
these
articles
bore
the
initials
of
the
family
name
of
the
prince
and
his
own
p
thus
damaging
the
articles
so
that
the
silver
and
gold
were
sold
for
their
weight
value
only
i
bought
them
and
adding
to
the
p
had
a
very
fine
table
service
still
in
my
possession
and
bearing
my
own
initials
p
while
dining
one
day
with
my
friend
brewster
in
paris
all
the
company
present
were
in
raptures
over
some
very
fine
lafitte
wine
on
the
table
and
the
usual
exclamations
delicious
and
fruity
were
heard
on
all
sides
when
i
went
to
the
south
of
france
the
doctor
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
to
lafitte
s
agent
good
at
bordeaux
and
i
was
shown
through
the
extensive
cellar
of
the
establishment
the
agent
talked
learnedly
almost
affectionately
about
the
choice
and
exclusive
vineyards
of
the
establishment
and
how
the
stones
in
the
ground
retailed
the
warmth
derived
from
the
sun
during
the
day
throughout
the
night
thus
mellowing
and
maturing
the
grapes
and
resulting
in
the
production
of
a
peculiar
wine
which
was
possible
to
no
other
plot
of
ground
in
the
entire
grape
country
i
afterwards
learned
however
that
this
exclusive
establishment
bought
up
the
entire
wine
product
of
all
the
vineyards
in
the
region
round
about
it
was
like
the
celebrated
cabana
cigars
in
havana
one
day
a
friend
was
dining
with
me
in
bordeaux
and
i
called
for
a
bottle
of
lafitte
which
purchased
on
the
very
ground
of
its
manufacture
was
of
course
genuine
and
deliciously
it
was
very
old
wine
of
some
famous
year
and
the
bottle
as
brought
up
from
the
bin
was
covered
with
cobwebs
and
dust
but
while
we
were
sipping
the
wine
and
exclaiming
fruity
at
proper
intervals
i
happened
to
take
out
my
knife
and
quite
inadvertently
cut
off
a
bit
of
the
label
the
next
day
when
my
friend
was
again
dining
with
me
i
called
for
another
bottle
of
the
peculiar
lafitte
which
had
so
delighted
us
yesterday
it
came
cobwebbed
and
and
was
duly
discussed
and
pronounced
deliciously
but
horrors
all
at
once
something
caught
my
attention
and
i
exclaimed
do
you
see
that
cut
label
that
is
the
very
bottle
which
held
the
rare
old
wine
of
yesterday
there
is
the
which
i
left
with
my
knife
on
the
bottle
and
i
summoned
the
landlord
and
thus
addressed
him
what
do
you
mean
you
scoundrel
by
putting
your
infernal
into
old
bottles
and
passing
it
off
upon
us
as
genuine
lafitte
he
protested
that
such
a
thing
was
impossible
we
were
at
the
very
fountain
head
of
the
wine
and
no
one
would
dare
to
attempt
such
a
fraud
especially
upon
experienced
like
ourselves
but
i
showed
him
my
careless
but
remembered
mark
on
the
bottle
and
proved
by
my
friend
that
we
had
the
same
bottle
for
our
wine
of
the
day
before
this
was
shown
so
conclusively
and
emphatically
that
the
landlord
finally
confessed
his
fraud
and
said
that
though
he
had
sold
thousands
of
bottles
of
lafitte
to
his
guests
he
never
had
two
dozen
bottles
of
the
genuine
article
in
his
possession
in
his
life
every
one
who
has
been
in
the
wine
district
knows
that
the
wine
is
trodden
from
the
grapes
by
the
bare
feet
of
the
peasants
and
while
i
was
there
desiring
a
new
experience
i
myself
trod
out
a
half
barrel
or
so
with
my
own
naked
feet
dancing
vigorously
the
while
to
the
sound
of
a
fiddle
in
spite
of
the
extraordinary
attention
and
unbounded
petting
the
little
general
received
at
the
hands
of
all
classes
he
was
in
no
sense
a
spoiled
child
but
retained
throughout
that
natural
simplicity
of
character
and
demeanor
which
added
so
much
to
the
charm
of
his
exhibitions
he
was
literally
the
pet
of
paris
and
after
a
protracted
and
most
profitable
season
we
started
on
a
tour
through
france
the
little
general
s
small
shetland
ponies
and
miniature
carriage
would
be
sure
to
arouse
the
enthusiasm
of
the
provincials
so
i
determined
to
take
them
along
with
us
we
went
first
to
rouen
and
from
thence
to
toulon
visiting
all
the
intermediate
towns
including
orleans
nantes
brest
bordeaux
where
i
witnessed
a
review
by
the
dukes
de
nemours
and
d
aumale
of
soldiers
who
were
encamped
near
the
city
from
bordeaux
we
went
to
toulouse
montpellier
nismes
marseilles
and
many
other
less
important
places
holding
levees
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
while
at
nantes
bordeaux
and
marseilles
the
general
also
appeared
in
the
theatres
in
his
french
part
of
petit
very
soon
after
leaving
paris
for
our
tour
through
france
i
found
that
there
were
many
places
where
it
would
be
impossible
to
proceed
otherwise
than
by
post
general
tom
thumb
s
party
numbered
twelve
persons
and
these
with
all
their
luggage
four
little
ponies
and
a
small
carriage
must
be
transported
in
posting
vehicles
of
some
description
i
therefore
resolved
that
as
posting
in
france
was
as
cheap
and
more
independent
than
any
other
method
of
travel
a
purchase
of
posting
vehicles
should
be
made
for
the
sole
use
of
the
renowned
general
tom
thumb
and
suite
one
vehicle
however
large
would
have
been
insufficient
for
the
whole
company
and
effects
and
moreover
would
have
been
against
the
regulations
these
regulations
required
that
each
person
should
pay
for
the
use
of
one
horse
whether
using
it
or
not
and
i
therefore
made
the
following
arrangements
i
purchased
a
to
carry
six
persons
to
be
drawn
by
six
horses
a
vehicle
on
springs
with
seats
for
four
persons
and
room
for
the
general
s
four
ponies
and
carriage
to
be
drawn
by
four
horses
and
lastly
a
third
vehicle
for
conveying
the
baggage
of
the
company
including
the
elegant
little
house
and
furniture
set
on
the
stage
in
the
general
s
performances
of
petit
poucet
at
the
theatres
the
whole
drawn
by
two
horses
with
such
a
retinue
the
general
cut
quite
a
swell
in
journeying
through
the
country
travelling
indeed
in
grander
style
than
a
field
marshal
would
have
thought
of
doing
in
posting
through
france
all
this
folly
and
expense
the
uninitiated
would
say
of
employing
twelve
horses
and
twelve
persons
to
say
nothing
of
the
general
s
four
ponies
in
exhibiting
a
person
weighing
only
fifteen
pounds
but
when
this
retinue
passed
along
the
roads
and
especially
when
it
came
into
a
town
people
naturally
and
eagerly
inquired
what
great
personage
was
on
his
travels
and
when
told
that
it
was
the
celebrated
general
tom
thumb
and
suite
everybody
desired
to
go
and
see
him
it
was
thus
the
best
advertising
we
could
have
had
and
was
really
in
many
places
our
cheapest
and
in
some
places
our
only
mode
of
getting
from
point
to
point
where
our
exhibitions
were
to
be
given
during
most
of
the
tour
i
was
a
week
or
two
ahead
of
the
company
making
arrangements
for
the
forthcoming
exhibitions
and
doing
my
entire
business
without
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
for
i
soon
picked
up
french
enough
to
get
along
very
well
indeed
i
did
not
forget
that
franklin
learned
to
speak
french
when
he
was
seventy
years
of
age
and
i
did
not
consider
myself
too
old
to
learn
what
indeed
i
was
obliged
to
learn
in
the
interests
of
my
business
as
for
the
little
general
who
was
accompanied
by
a
preceptor
and
translator
he
very
soon
began
to
give
his
entire
speaking
performances
in
french
and
his
piece
petit
poucet
was
spoken
as
if
he
were
a
native
in
fact
i
soon
became
the
general
s
though
not
doing
the
duties
of
an
to
an
ordinary
exhibition
since
these
duties
generally
consist
in
largely
puffing
the
coming
man
and
expected
show
thus
endeavoring
to
create
a
public
appetite
and
to
excite
curiosity
my
duties
were
quite
different
after
engaging
the
largest
theatre
or
saloon
to
be
found
in
the
town
i
put
out
a
simple
placard
announcing
that
the
general
would
appear
on
such
a
day
thereafter
my
whole
energies
were
directed
apparently
to
keeping
the
people
quiet
i
begged
them
not
to
get
excited
i
assured
them
through
the
public
journals
that
every
opportunity
should
be
afforded
to
permit
every
person
to
see
the
distinguished
little
general
who
had
delighted
the
principal
monarchs
of
europe
and
more
than
a
million
of
their
subjects
and
that
if
one
exhibition
in
the
largest
audience
room
in
the
town
would
not
suffice
two
or
even
three
would
be
given
this
was
done
quietly
and
yet
as
an
advertisement
effectively
for
strange
as
it
may
seem
people
who
were
told
to
keep
quiet
would
get
terribly
excited
and
when
the
general
arrived
and
opened
his
exhibitions
excitement
would
be
at
fever
heat
the
levees
would
be
thronged
and
the
treasury
filled
numerous
were
the
word
battles
i
had
with
mayors
managers
of
theatres
directors
of
hospitals
and
others
relative
to
what
i
considered
justly
i
think
the
outrageous
imposition
which
the
laws
permitted
in
the
way
of
taxes
upon
thus
the
laws
required
for
the
sake
of
charity
per
cent
of
my
gross
receipts
for
the
hospitals
while
to
encourage
a
local
theatre
or
theatres
which
might
suffer
from
an
outside
show
twenty
per
cent
more
must
be
given
to
the
local
managers
of
course
this
law
was
nearly
a
dead
letter
for
to
have
taken
per
cent
of
my
gross
receipts
at
every
exhibition
would
soon
have
driven
me
from
the
provinces
so
the
hospitals
were
generally
content
with
ten
per
cent
and
five
or
ten
francs
a
day
satisfied
the
manager
of
a
provincial
theatre
but
at
bordeaux
the
manager
of
the
theatre
wished
to
engage
the
general
to
appear
in
his
establishment
and
as
i
declined
his
offer
he
threatened
to
debar
me
from
exhibiting
anywhere
in
town
by
demanding
for
himself
the
full
twenty
per
cent
the
law
allowed
besides
inducing
the
directors
of
the
hospitals
to
compel
me
to
pay
them
per
cent
more
here
was
a
dilemma
i
must
yield
and
take
half
i
thought
myself
entitled
to
and
permit
the
general
to
play
for
the
manager
or
submit
to
legal
extortion
or
forego
my
exhibitions
i
offered
the
manager
six
per
cent
of
my
receipts
and
he
laughed
at
me
i
talked
with
the
hospital
directors
and
they
told
me
that
as
the
manager
favored
them
they
felt
bound
to
stand
by
him
i
announced
in
the
public
journals
that
the
general
could
not
appear
in
bordeaux
on
account
of
the
cupidity
and
extortionate
demands
of
the
theatre
manager
and
the
hospital
directors
the
people
talked
and
the
papers
denounced
but
manager
and
directors
remained
as
firm
as
rocks
in
their
positions
tom
thumb
was
to
arrive
in
two
days
and
i
was
in
a
decided
scrape
the
mayor
interceded
for
me
but
to
no
avail
the
manager
had
determined
to
enforce
an
almost
obsolete
law
unless
i
would
permit
the
general
to
play
in
his
theatre
every
night
my
yankee
dander
was
up
and
i
declared
that
i
would
exhibit
the
general
gratis
rather
than
submit
to
the
demand
whereupon
the
manager
only
laughed
at
me
the
more
to
think
how
snugly
he
had
got
me
now
it
happened
that
once
upon
a
time
bordeaux
like
most
cities
was
a
little
village
and
the
little
village
of
vincennes
lay
one
mile
east
of
it
bordeaux
had
grown
and
stretched
itself
and
thickly
settled
far
beyond
vincennes
bringing
the
latter
nearly
in
the
centre
of
bordeaux
yet
strange
to
say
vincennes
maintained
its
own
identity
and
had
its
own
mayor
and
municipal
rights
quite
independent
of
bordeaux
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
informant
who
told
me
this
but
i
speedily
sought
out
the
mayor
of
vincennes
found
such
a
personage
and
cautiously
inquired
if
there
was
a
theatre
or
a
hospital
within
his
limits
he
assured
me
there
was
not
i
told
him
my
story
and
asked
if
i
open
an
exhibition
within
your
limits
will
there
be
any
percentages
to
pay
from
my
receipts
not
a
sou
replied
the
mayor
will
you
give
me
a
writing
to
that
effect
with
the
greatest
pleasure
replied
the
mayor
and
he
did
so
at
once
i
put
this
precious
paper
in
my
pocket
and
in
a
few
moments
i
hired
the
largest
dancing
saloon
in
the
place
a
room
capable
of
holding
over
people
i
then
announced
especially
to
the
delighted
citizens
of
bordeaux
that
the
general
would
open
his
exhibitions
in
vincennes
which
he
soon
did
to
an
overflowing
house
for
thirteen
days
we
exhibited
to
houses
averaging
more
than
francs
per
day
and
for
ten
days
more
at
largely
increased
receipts
not
one
sou
of
which
went
for
taxes
or
percentages
the
manager
and
directors
theatre
and
hospital
got
nothing
instead
of
the
fair
allowance
i
would
willingly
have
given
them
oh
yes
they
got
something
that
is
a
lesson
not
to
attempt
to
offset
french
shylockism
against
yankee
shrewdness
we
were
in
the
south
of
france
in
the
vintage
season
nothing
can
surpass
the
richness
of
the
country
at
that
time
of
the
year
we
travelled
for
many
miles
where
the
eye
could
see
nothing
but
vineyards
loaded
with
luscious
grapes
and

of

trees

remunerative
and

us
at

s

discovered
that
he
had
left
his
passport
behind
him
at
lille
at
marseilles
or
elsewhere
in
france
he
could
not
tell
where
for
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
called
upon
to
present
it
i
was
much
annoyed
and
indignantly
told
him
that
he
would
never
make
a
good
showman
because
a
good
showman
never
forgot
i
could
see
that
my
allusion
to
him
as
a
showman
was
by
no
means
pleasant
which
leads
me
to
recount
the
circumstances
under
which
i
was
first
brought
in
contact
with
the
professor
he
was
really
a
professor
and
teacher
of
english
in
one
of
the
best
educational
establishments
in
paris
very
soon
after
opening
my
exhibitions
in
that
city
i
saw
the
necessity
of
having
a
translator
who
was
qualified
to
act
as
a
medium
between
the
general
and
the
highly
cultivated
audiences
that
daily
favored
us
at
our
levees
i
had
begun
with
a
not
interpreter
who
when
the
general
personated
cupid
for
instance
would
cry
out
coopeed
to
which
some
one
would
be
sure
to
respond
stoopeed
to
the
annoyance
of
myself
and
the
amusement
of
the
audience
i
accordingly
determined
to
procure
the
best
interpreter
i
could
find
and
i
was
directed
to
call
upon
professor
pinte
i
saw
him
and
briefly
stated
what
i
wanted
in
what
capacity
i
proposed
to
employ
him
and
what
salary
i
would
pay
him
he
was
highly
indignant
and
informed
me
that
he
was
no
showman
and
had
no
desire
to
learn
or
engage
in
the
business
but
my
dear
sir
said
i
it
is
not
as
a
showman
that
i
wish
to
employ
your
valuable
services
but
as
a
preceptor
to
my
young
and
interesting
ward
general
tom
thumb
whom
i
desire
to
have
instructed
in
the
french
language
and
in
other
accomplishments
you
are
so
competent
to
impart
at
the
same
time
i
should
expect
that
you
would
be
willing
to
accompany
my
ward
and
your
pupil
and
attend
his
public
exhibitions
for
the
purpose
of
translating
as
may
be
necessary
to
the
cultivated
people
of
your
own
class
who
are
the
principal
patrons
of
our
this
seemed
to
put
an
entirely
new
face
upon
the
matter
especially
as
i
had
offered
the
professor
a
salary
five
times
larger
probably
than
he
was
then
receiving
so
he
rapidly
revolved
the
subject
in
his
mind
and
said
ah
while
i
could
not
possibly
accept
a
situation
as
a
showman
i
should
be
most
happy
to
accept
the
terms
and
the
position
as
preceptor
to
your
he
was
engaged
and
at
once
entered
upon
his
duties
not
only
as
preceptor
to
the
general
but
as
the
efficient
and
always
excellent
interpreter
at
our
exhibitions
and
wherever
we
needed
his
services
on
the
route
as
he
had
lost
his
passport
when
we
came
to
courtrai
on
the
belgian
frontier
i
managed
to
procure
a
permit
for
him
which
enabled
him
to
proceed
with
the
party
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
difficulties
for
i
had
all
our
property
including
the
general
s
ponies
and
equipage
to
pass
through
the
and
among
other
things
there
was
a
large
box
of
medals
with
a
likeness
of
the
general
on
one
side
and
of
queen
victoria
and
prince
albert
on
the
other
side
which
were
sold
in
large
numbers
as
souvenirs
at
our
exhibitions
they
were
struck
off
at
a
considerable
expense
in
england
and
commanded
a
ready
sale
the
officers
were
informed
however
that
these
medals
were
mere
advertising
cards
as
they
really
were
of
our
exhibitions
and
i
begged
their
acceptance
of
as
many
as
they
pleased
to
put
in
their
pockets
they
were
beautiful
medals
and
a
few
dozen
were
speedily
distributed
among
the
delighted
officials
who
forthwith
passed
our
lithographs
and
other
property
with
very
little
trouble
they
wanted
however
to
charge
a
duty
upon
the
general
s
ponies
and
carriage
but
when
i
produced
a
document
showing
that
the
french
government
had
admitted
them
they
did
the
same
this
superb
establishment
led
these
officials
to
think
he
must
be
a
very
distinguished
man
and
they
asked
what
rank
he
held
in
his
own
country
he
is
prince
charles
stratton
of
the
dukedom
of
bridgeport
in
the
kingdom
of
connecticut
said
sherman
whereupon
they
all
reverently
raised
their
hats
when
the
general
entered
the
car
some
of
the
railway
men
who
had
seen
the
distribution
of
medals
among
the
officers
came
to
me
and
begged
similar
souvenirs
of
their
distinguished
passenger
and
i
gave
the
medals
very
freely
till
the
applications
became
so
persistent
as
to
threaten
a
serious
pecuniary
loss
at
last
i
handed
out
a
final
dozen
in
one
package
and
said
there
that
is
the
last
of
them
the
rest
are
in
the
box
and
beyond
my
all
this
while
professor
pinte
was
brooding
over
my
remark
to
him
about
the
loss
of
his
passport
the
word
showman
rankled
and
he
asked
me
mr
barnum
do
you
consider
me
a
showman
i
laughingly
replied
why
i
consider
you
the
eminent
professor
pinte
preceptor
to
general
tom
thumb
but
after
all
we
are
all
finding
himself
so
classed
with
the
rest
of
us
he
ventured
to
inquire
what
were
the
qualifications
of
a
good
showman
to
which
i
replied
he
must
have
a
decided
taste
for
catering
for
the
public
prominent
perceptive
faculties
tact
a
thorough
knowledge
of
human
nature
great
suavity
and
plenty
of
soft
soft
sup
exclaimed
the
interested
professor
what
is
soft
i
explained
as
best
i
could
how
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
had
come
to
convey
the
idea
of
getting
into
the
good
graces
of
people
and
pleasing
those
with
whom
we
are
brought
in
contact
pinte
laughed
and
as
he
thought
of
the
generous
medal
distribution
an
idea
struck
him
i
think
those
railway
officials
must
have
very
dirty
hands
you
are
compelled
to
use
so
much
soft
brussels
is
paris
in
miniature
and
is
one
of
the
most
charming
cities
i
ever
visited
we
found
elegant
quarters
and
the
day
after
our
arrival
by
command
we
visited
king
leopold
and
the
queen
at
their
palace
the
king
and
queen
had
already
seen
the
general
in
london
but
they
wished
to
present
him
to
their
children
and
to
the
distinguished
persons
whom
we
found
assembled
after
a
most
agreeable
hour
we
came
away
the
general
as
usual
receiving
many
fine
presents
the
following
day
i
opened
the
exhibition
in
a
beautiful
hall
which
on
that
day
and
on
every
afternoon
and
evening
while
we
remained
there
was
crowded
by
throngs
of
the
first
people
in
the
city
on
the
second
or
third
day
in
the
midst
of
the
exhibition
i
suddenly
missed
the
case
containing
the
valuable
presents
the
general
had
received
from
kings
queens
noblemen
and
gentlemen
and
instantly
gave
the
alarm
some
thief
had
intruded
for
the
express
purpose
of
stealing
these
jewels
and
in
the
crowd
had
been
entirely
successful
in
his
object
the
police
were
notified
and
i
offered
francs
reward
for
the
recovery
of
the
property
a
day
or
two
afterwards
a
man
went
into
a
jeweller
s
shop
and
offered
for
sale
among
other
things
a
gold
mounted
with
turquoises
and
presented
by
the
duke
of
devonshire
to
the
general
the
jeweller
seeing
the
general
s
initials
on
the
box
sharply
questioned
the
man
who
became
alarmed
and
ran
out
of
the
shop
an
alarm
was
raised
and
the
man
was
caught
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
the
entire
property
was
returned
to
the
great
delight
of
the
general
and
myself
wherever
we
exhibited
afterwards
no
matter
how
respectable
the
audience
the
case
of
presents
was
always
carefully
watched
while
i
was
in
brussels
i
could
do
no
less
than
visit
the
of
waterloo
and
i
proposed
that
our
party
should
be
composed
of
professor
pinte
stratton
father
of
general
tom
thumb
sherman
and
myself
going
was
a
new
sensation
to
stratton
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
start
by
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
in
order
to
accomplish
the
distance
sixteen
miles
and
return
in
time
for
our
afternoon
performance
he
demurred
i
don
t
want
to
get
up
before
daylight
and
go
off
on
a
journey
for
the
sake
of
seeing
a
darned
old
field
of
wheat
said
stratton
sherwood
do
try
to
be
like
somebody
once
in
your
life
and
go
said
his
wife
the
appeal
was
irresistible
and
he
consented
we
engaged
a
coach
and
horses
the
night
previous
and
started
punctually
at
the
hour
appointed
we
stopped
at
the
neat
little
church
in
the
village
of
waterloo
for
the
purpose
of
examining
the
tablets
erected
to
the
memory
of
some
of
the
english
who
fell
in
the
contest
thence
we
passed
to
the
house
in
which
the
leg
of
lord
uxbridge
marquis
of
anglesey
was
amputated
a
neat
little
monument
in
the
garden
designates
the
spot
where
the
shattered
member
had
been
interred
in
the
house
is
shown
a
part
of
the
boot
which
is
said
to
have
once
covered
the
unlucky
leg
the
visitor
feels
it
but
considerate
to
hand
a
franc
or
two
to
the
female
who
exhibits
the
monument
and
limb
i
did
so
and
stratton
though
he
felt
that
he
had
not
received
the
worth
of
his
money
still
did
not
like
to
be
considered
penurious
so
he
handed
over
a
piece
of
silver
coin
to
the
attendant
i
expressed
a
desire
to
have
a
small
piece
of
the
boot
to
exhibit
in
my
museum
the
lady
cut
off
without
hesitation
a
slip
three
inches
long
by
one
in
width
i
handed
her
a
couple
more
francs
and
stratton
desiring
as
he
said
to
show
a
piece
of
the
boot
in
old
bridgeport
received
a
similar
slip
and
paid
a
similar
amount
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
the
lady
was
thus
liberal
in
dispensing
pieces
of
the
identical
boot
to
all
visitors
this
must
have
been
about
the
thousandth
boot
that
had
been
cut
as
the
simon
pure
since
with
the
consoling
reflection
that
the
female
purchased
all
the
boots
in
brussels
and
its
vicinity
and
rejoicing
that
somebody
was
making
a
trifle
out
of
that
accident
besides
the
inventor
of
the
celebrated
anglesey
leg
we
passed
on
towards
the
lying
about
a
mile
distant
arriving
at
mont
saint
jean
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
ground
we
were
beset
by
some
eighteen
or
twenty
persons
who
offered
their
services
as
guides
to
indicate
the
most
important
localities
each
applicant
professed
to
know
the
exact
spot
where
every
man
had
been
placed
who
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
and
each
of
course
claimed
to
have
been
engaged
in
that
sanguinary
contest
although
it
had
occurred
thirty
years
before
and
some
of
these
fellows
were
only
it
seemed
from
to
years
of
age
we
accepted
an
old
man
who
at
first
declared
that
he
was
killed
in
the
battle
but
perceiving
our
looks
of
incredulity
consented
to
modify
his
statement
so
far
as
to
assert
that
he
was
horribly
wounded
and
lay
upon
the
ground
three
days
before
receiving
assistance
once
upon
the
ground
our
guide
with
much
gravity
pointed
out
the
place
where
the
duke
of
wellington
took
his
station
during
a
great
part
of
the
action
the
locality
where
the
reserve
of
the
british
army
was
stationed
the
spot
where
napoleon
placed
his
favorite
guard
the
little
mound
on
which
was
erected
a
temporary
observatory
for
his
use
during
the
battle
the
portion
of
the
field
at
which
blucher
entered
with
the
prussian
army
the
precise
location
of
the
scotch
greys
the
spot
where
fell
sir
alexander
gordon
lieut
canning
and
many
others
of
celebrity
i
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
where
captain
tippitiwichet
of
the
connecticut
fusileers
was
killed
oui
monsieur
he
replied
with
perfect
confidence
for
he
felt
bound
to
know
or
to
pretend
to
know
every
particular
he
then
proceeded
to
point
out
exactly
the
spot
where
my
unfortunate
connecticut
friend
had
breathed
his
last
after
indicating
the
locations
where
some
twenty
more
fictitious
friends
from
coney
island
new
jersey
cape
cod
and
saratoga
springs
had
given
up
the
ghost
we
handed
him
his
commission
and
declined
to
give
him
further
trouble
stratton
grumbled
at
the
imposition
as
he
handed
out
a
couple
of
francs
for
the
information
received
upon
quitting
the
we
were
accosted
by
a
dozen
persons
of
both
sexes
with
baskets
on
their
arms
or
bags
in
their
hands
containing
relics
of
the
battle
for
sale
these
consisted
of
a
great
variety
of
implements
of
war
pistols
bullets
besides
brass
french
eagles
buttons
etc
i
purchased
a
number
of
them
for
the
museum
and
stratton
was
equally
liberal
in
obtaining
a
supply
for
his
friends
in
old
we
also
purchased
maps
of
the
pictures
of
the
triumphal
mound
surmounted
by
the
colossal
belgic
lion
in
bronze
etc
these
frequent
and
renewed
taxations
annoyed
stratton
very
much
and
as
he
handed
out
a
five
franc
piece
for
a
complete
he
remarked
that
he
guessed
the
battle
of
waterloo
had
cost
a
darned
sight
more
since
it
was
fought
than
it
did
before
but
his
misfortunes
did
not
terminate
here
when
we
had
proceeded
four
or
five
miles
upon
our
road
home
crash
went
the
carriage
we
alighted
and
found
that
the
was
broken
it
was
now
a
quarter
past
one
o
clock
the
little
general
s
exhibition
was
advertised
to
commence
in
brussels
at
two
o
clock
and
could
not
take
place
without
us
we
were
unable
to
walk
the
distance
in
double
the
time
at
our
disposal
and
as
no
carriage
was
to
be
got
in
that
part
of
the
country
i
concluded
to
take
the
matter
easy
and
forego
all
idea
of
exhibiting
before
evening
stratton
however
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
losing
the
chance
of
taking
in
six
or
eight
hundred
francs
and
he
determined
to
take
matters
in
hand
in
order
if
possible
to
get
our
party
into
brussels
in
time
to
save
the
afternoon
exhibition
he
hastened
to
a
accompanied
by
the
interpreter
professor
pinte
sherman
and
myself
leisurely
bringing
up
the
rear
stratton
asked
the
old
farmer
if
he
had
a
carriage
he
had
not
have
you
no
vehicle
he
inquired
yes
i
have
that
vehicle
he
replied
pointing
to
an
old
cart
filled
with
manure
and
standing
in
his
barnyard
thunder
is
that
all
the
conveyance
you
have
got
asked
stratton
being
assured
that
it
was
stratton
concluded
that
it
was
better
to
ride
in
a
manure
cart
than
not
get
to
brussels
in
time
what
will
you
ask
to
drive
us
to
brussels
in
of
an
hour
demanded
stratton
illustration
cart
it
is
impossible
replied
the
farmer
i
should
want
two
hours
for
my
horse
to
do
it
but
ours
is
a
very
pressing
case
and
if
we
are
not
there
in
time
we
lose
more
than
five
hundred
francs
said
stratton
the
old
farmer
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
and
agreed
to
get
us
to
brussels
in
an
hour
for
eighty
francs
stratton
tried
to
beat
him
down
but
it
was
of
no
use
oh
go
it
stratton
said
sherman
eighty
francs
you
know
is
only
sixteen
dollars
and
you
will
probably
save
a
hundred
by
it
for
i
expect
a
full
house
at
our
afternoon
exhibition
but
i
have
already
spent
about
ten
dollars
for
nonsense
said
stratton
and
we
shall
have
to
pay
for
the
broken
carriage
but
what
can
you
do
better
chimed
in
professor
pinte
it
is
an
outrageous
extortion
to
charge
sixteen
dollars
for
an
old
horse
and
cart
to
go
ten
miles
why
in
old
bridgeport
i
could
get
it
done
for
three
dollars
replied
stratton
in
a
tone
of
vexation
it
is
the
custom
of
the
country
said
professor
pinte
and
we
must
submit
to
by
the
way
this
was
a
favorite
expression
of
the
professor
s
whenever
we
were
imposed
upon
or
felt
that
we
were
not
used
right
pinte
would
always
endeavor
to
smooth
it
over
by
informing
us
it
was
the
custom
of
the
well
it
s
a
thundering
mean
custom
any
how
said
stratton
and
i
wont
stand
such
an
but
what
shall
we
do
earnestly
inquired
pinte
it
may
be
a
high
price
but
it
is
better
to
pay
that
than
to
lose
our
afternoon
performance
and
five
or
six
hundred
this
appeal
to
the
pocket
touched
stratton
s
feelings
so
submitting
to
the
extortion
he
replied
to
our
interpreter
well
tell
the
old
robber
to
dump
his
as
soon
as
possible
or
we
shall
lose
half
an
hour
in
the
cart
was
dumped
and
a
large
flemish
horse
was
attached
to
it
with
a
rope
harness
some
boards
were
laid
across
the
cart
for
seats
the
party
tumbled
into
the
rustic
vehicle
a
boy
son
of
the
old
farmer
mounted
the
horse
and
stratton
gave
orders
to
get
wait
a
moment
said
the
farmer
you
have
not
paid
me
yet
i
ll
pay
your
boy
when
we
get
to
brussels
provided
he
gets
there
within
the
hour
replied
stratton
oh
he
is
sure
to
get
there
in
an
hour
said
the
farmer
but
i
can
t
let
him
go
unless
you
pay
in
the
minutes
were
flying
rapidly
the
anticipated
loss
of
the
day
exhibition
of
general
tom
thumb
flitted
before
his
eyes
and
stratton
in
very
desperation
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
forth
sixteen
pieces
which
he
dropped
one
at
a
time
into
the
hand
of
the
farmer
and
then
called
out
to
the
boy
there
now
do
try
to
see
if
you
can
go
the
boy
did
go
ahead
but
it
was
with
such
a
snail
s
pace
that
it
would
have
puzzled
a
man
of
tolerable
eyesight
to
have
determined
whether
the
horse
was
moving
or
standing
still
to
make
it
still
more
interesting
it
commenced
raining
furiously
as
we
had
left
brussels
in
a
coach
and
the
morning
had
promised
us
a
pleasant
day
we
had
omitted
our
umbrellas
we
were
soon
soaked
to
the
skin
we
grinned
and
bore
it
awhile
without
grumbling
at
length
stratton
who
was
almost
too
angry
to
speak
desired
pinte
to
ask
the
boy
if
he
expected
to
walk
his
horse
all
the
way
to
brussels
certainly
replied
the
boy
he
is
too
big
and
fat
to
do
any
thing
but
walk
we
never
trot
stratton
was
terrified
as
he
thought
of
the
loss
of
the
day
exhibition
and
he
cursed
the
boy
the
cart
the
rain
the
luck
and
even
the
battle
of
waterloo
itself
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
the
horse
would
not
run
but
the
rain
did
down
our
backs
at
two
o
clock
the
time
appointed
for
our
exhibition
we
were
yet
some
seven
miles
from
brussels
the
horse
walked
slowly
and
philosophically
through
the
pitiless
storm
the
steam
majestically
rising
from
the
old
to
the
no
small
disturbance
of
our
unfortunate
olfactories
it
will
take
two
hours
to
get
to
brussels
at
this
rate
growled
stratton
oh
no
replied
the
boy
it
will
only
take
about
two
hours
from
the
time
we
but
your
father
agreed
to
get
us
there
in
an
hour
answered
stratton
i
know
it
responded
the
boy
but
he
knew
it
would
take
more
than
i
ll
sue
him
for
damage
by
thunder
said
stratton
oh
there
would
be
no
use
in
that
chimed
in
pinte
for
you
could
get
no
satisfaction
in
this
but
i
shall
lose
more
than
a
hundred
dollars
by
being
two
hours
instead
of
one
said
stratton
they
care
nothing
about
that
all
they
care
for
is
your
eighty
francs
remarked
pinte
but
they
have
lied
and
swindled
me
replied
stratton
oh
you
must
not
mind
that
it
is
the
custom
of
the
stratton
gave
the
country
and
its
customs
another
cursing
all
things
will
finally
have
an
end
and
our
party
did
at
length
actually
arrive
in
brussels
cart
and
all
in
precisely
two
hours
and
a
half
from
the
time
we
left
the
farmers
house
of
course
we
were
too
late
to
exhibit
the
little
general
hundreds
of
visitors
had
gone
away
disappointed
with
feelings
of
utter
desperation
stratton
started
for
a
barber
s
shop
he
had
a
fine
black
bushy
head
of
hair
of
which
he
was
a
little
proud
and
every
morning
he
submitted
it
to
the
of
the
barber
his
hair
had
not
been
cut
for
several
weeks
and
after
being
shaved
he
desired
the
barber
to
trim
his
flowing
locks
a
little
the
barber
clipped
off
the
ends
of
the
hair
and
asked
stratton
if
that
was
sufficient
no
he
replied
i
want
it
trimmed
a
little
shorter
cut
away
and
i
will
tell
you
when
to
stratton
had
risen
from
bed
at
an
unusual
hour
and
after
having
passed
through
the
troubles
and
excitements
of
the
unlucky
morning
he
began
to
feel
a
little
drowsy
this
feeling
was
augmented
by
the
soothing
sensations
of
the
tonsorial
process
and
while
the
barber
quietly
pursued
his
avocation
stratton
as
quietly
fell
asleep
the
barber
went
entirely
over
his
head
cutting
off
a
couple
of
inches
of
hair
with
every
clip
of
his
scissors
he
then
rested
for
a
moment
expecting
his
customer
would
tell
him
that
it
was
sufficient
but
the
unconscious
stratton
uttered
not
a
word
and
the
barber
thinking
he
had
not
cut
the
hair
close
enough
went
over
the
head
again
again
did
he
wait
for
an
answer
little
thinking
that
his
patron
was
asleep
remembering
that
stratton
had
told
him
to
cut
away
and
he
would
tell
him
when
to
stop
the
innocent
barber
went
over
the
head
the
third
time
cutting
the
hair
nearly
as
close
as
if
he
had
shaved
it
with
a
razor
having
finished
he
again
waited
for
orders
from
his
customer
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
the
barber
was
surprised
and
that
surprise
was
increased
when
he
heard
a
noise
which
seemed
very
like
a
snore
coming
from
the
nasal
organ
of
his
unconscious
victim
the
poor
barber
saw
the
error
that
he
had
committed
and
in
dismay
as
if
by
mistake
he
hit
stratton
on
the
side
of
the
head
with
his
scissors
and
woke
him
he
started
to
his
feet
looked
in
the
glass
and
to
his
utter
horror
saw
that
he
was
unfit
to
appear
in
public
without
a
wig
he
swore
like
a
trooper
but
he
could
not
swear
the
hair
back
on
to
his
head
and
putting
on
his
hat
which
dropped
loosely
over
his
eyes
he
started
for
the
hotel
his
despair
and
indignation
were
so
great
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
give
utterance
to
words
of
explanation
his
feelings
were
not
allayed
by
the
deafening
burst
of
laughter
which
ensued
he
said
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
ever
went
a
and
he
guessed
it
would
be
the
last
several
months
subsequent
to
our
visit
to
waterloo
i
was
in
birmingham
and
there
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
firm
who
manufactured
to
order
and
sent
to
waterloo
barrels
of
relics
every
year
at
waterloo
these
relics
are
planted
and
in
due
time
dug
up
and
sold
at
large
prices
as
precious
remembrances
of
the
great
battle
our
waterloo
purchases
looked
rather
cheap
after
this
discovery
while
we
were
in
brussels
stratton
the
mother
of
the
general
tasted
some
sausages
which
she
declared
the
best
things
she
had
eaten
in
france
or
belgium
in
fact
she
said
she
had
found
little
that
was
fit
to
eat
in
this
country
for
every
thing
was
so
frenchified
and
covered
in
gravy
she
dared
not
eat
it
but
there
was
something
that
tasted
natural
about
these
sausages
she
had
never
eaten
any
as
good
even
in
she
sent
to
the
landlady
to
inquire
the
name
of
them
for
she
meant
to
buy
some
to
take
along
with
her
the
answer
came
that
they
were
called
saucisse
de
lyon
lyons
sausages
and
straightway
stratton
went
out
and
purchased
half
a
dozen
pounds
sherman
soon
came
in
and
on
learning
what
she
had
in
her
package
he
remarked
mrs
stratton
do
you
know
what
lyons
sausages
are
made
of
no
she
replied
but
i
know
that
they
are
well
replied
sherman
they
may
be
good
but
they
are
made
from
donkeys
which
is
said
to
be
the
fact
stratton
said
she
was
not
to
be
fooled
so
easily
that
she
knew
better
and
that
she
should
stick
to
the
sausages
presently
professor
pinte
entered
the
room
mr
pinte
said
sherman
you
are
a
frenchman
and
know
every
thing
about
edibles
pray
tell
me
what
lyons
sausages
are
made
of
asses
replied
the
inoffensive
professor
stratton
seized
the
package
the
street
window
was
open
and
in
less
than
a
minute
a
large
brindle
dog
was
bearing
the
lyons
sausages
triumphantly
away
there
were
many
other
amusing
incidents
during
our
brief
stay
at
brussels
but
i
have
no
space
to
record
them
after
a
very

the

again
opened

levees
in

with
undiminished
success
his
unbounded
popularity
on
the
continent
and
his
receptions
by
king
louis
philippe
of
france
and
king
leopold
of
belgium
had
added
greatly
to
his
prestige
and
fame
those
who
had
seen
him
when
he
was
in
london
months
before
came
to
see
him
again
and
new
visitors
crowded
by
thousands
to
the
general
s
levees
besides
giving
these
daily
entertainments
the
general
appeared
occasionally
for
an
hour
during
the
intermissions
at
some
place
in
the
suburbs
and
for
a
long
time
he
appeared
every
day
at
the
surrey
zoÃ¶logical
gardens
under
the
direction
of
the
proprietor
my
particular
friend
tyler
this
place
subsequently
became
celebrated
for
its
great
music
hall
in
which
spurgeon
the
sensational
preacher
first
attained
his
notoriety
the
place
was
always
crowded
and
when
the
general
had
gone
through
with
his
performances
on
the
little
stage
in
order
that
all
might
see
him
he
was
put
into
a
balloon
which
secured
by
ropes
was
then
passed
around
the
ground
just
above
the
people
s
heads
some
forty
men
managed
the
ropes
and
prevented
the
balloon
from
rising
but
one
day
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
took
the
balloon
fairly
out
of
the
hands
of
half
the
men
who
had
hold
of
the
ropes
while
others
were
lifted
from
the
ground
and
had
not
an
alarm
been
instantly
given
which
called
at
least
two
hundred
to
the
rescue
the
little
general
would
have
been
lost
in
addition
to
other
engagements
the
general
frequently
performed
in
douglass
s
standard
theatre
in
the
city
in
the
play
hop
o
my
thumb
which
was
written
for
him
by
my
friend
albert
smith
whom
i
met
soon
after
my
first
arrival
in
london
and
with
whom
i
became
very
intimate
after
my
arrival
in
paris
seeing
the
decided
success
of
petit
poucet
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
want
such
a
play
when
i
returned
to
england
and
the
united
states
so
i
wrote
to
albert
smith
inviting
him
to
make
me
a
visit
in
paris
intending
to
have
him
see
this
play
and
either
translate
or
adapt
it
or
write
a
new
one
in
english
he
came
and
stayed
with
me
a
week
visiting
the
vaudeville
theatre
to
see
petit
poucet
nearly
every
night
and
we
compared
notes
and
settled
upon
a
plan
for
hop
o
my
he
went
back
to
london
and
wrote
the
play
and
it
was
very
popular
indeed
during
our
stay
of
three
months
at
this
time
in
egyptian
hall
we
made
occasional
excursions
and
gave
exhibitions
at
brighton
bath
cheltenham
leamington
and
other
watering
places
and
fashionable
resorts
it
was
at
the
height
of
the
season
in
these
places
and
our
houses
were
very
large
and
our
profits
in
proportion
in
october
i
made
my
first
return
visit
to
the
united
states
leaving
general
tom
thumb
in
england
in
the
hands
of
an
accomplished
and
faithful
agent
who
continued
the
exhibitions
during
my
absence
one
of
the
principal
reasons
for
my
return
at
this
time
was
my
anxiety
to
renew
the
museum
building
lease
although
my
first
lease
of
five
years
had
still
three
years
longer
to
run
i
told
olmsted
that
if
he
would
not
renew
my
lease
on
the
same
terms
for
at
least
five
years
more
i
would
immediately
put
up
a
new
building
remove
my
museum
close
his
building
during
the
last
year
of
my
lease
and
cover
it
from
top
to
bottom
with
placards
stating
where
my
new
museum
was
to
be
found
pending
an
arrangement
i
went
to
stewart
who
had
just
purchased
the
washington
hall
property
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
chambers
street
intending
to
erect
a
store
on
the
site
and
proposed
to
join
him
in
building
he
to
take
the
lower
floor
of
the
new
store
for
his
business
and
i
to
own
and
occupy
the
upper
stories
for
my
museum
he
said
he
would
give
me
an
answer
in
the
course
of
a
week
meanwhile
olmsted
gave
me
the
additional
five
years
lease
i
asked
and
i
so
notified
stewart
seeing
the
kind
of
building
that
stewart
erected
on
his
lots
i
do
not
know
if
he
seriously
entertained
my
proposition
to
join
him
in
the
enterprise
but
he
was
by
no
means
the
great
merchant
then
he
afterwards
became
and
neither
of
us
then
thought
probably
of
the
gigantic
enterprises
we
were
subsequently
to
undertake
and
the
great
things
we
were
to
accomplish
having
completed
my
business
arrangements
in
new
york
i
returned
to
england
with
my
wife
and
daughters
and
hired
a
house
in
london
my
house
was
the
scene
of
constant
hospitality
which
i
extended
to
my
numerous
friends
in
return
for
the
many
attentions
shown
to
me
it
seemed
then
as
if
i
had
more
and
stronger
friends
in
london
than
in
new
york
i
had
met
and
had
been
introduced
to
almost
everybody
who
was
anybody
and
among
them
all
some
of
the
best
soon
became
to
me
much
more
than
mere
acquaintances
among
the
distinguished
people
whom
i
met
i
was
introduced
to
the
samuel
rogers
i
saw
him
at
a
dinner
party
at
the
residence
of
the
american
minister
the
honorable
edward
everett
the
old
banker
was
very
feeble
but
careful
nursing
and
all
the
appliances
that
unbounded
wealth
could
bring
still
kept
the
life
in
him
and
he
managed
not
only
to
continue
to
give
his
own
celebrated
breakfasts
but
to
go
out
frequently
to
enjoy
the
hospitality
of
others
as
we
were
going
in
to
dinner
i
stepped
aside
so
that
rogers
who
was
tottering
along
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
friend
could
go
in
before
me
when
rogers
said
pass
in
barnum
pass
in
i
always
consider
it
an
honor
to
follow
an
when
our
three
months
engagement
at
egyptian
hall
had
expired
i
arranged
for
a
protracted
provincial
tour
through
great
britain
i
had
made
a
flying
visit
to
scotland
before
we
went
to
paris
mainly
to
procure
the
beautiful
scotch
costumes
daggers
which
were
carefully
made
for
the
general
at
edinburgh
and
to
teach
the
general
the
scotch
dances
with
a
bit
of
the
scotch
dialect
which
added
so
much
to
the
interest
of
his
exhibitions
in
paris
and
elsewhere
my
second
visit
to
scotland
for
the
purpose
of
giving
exhibitions
extended
as
far
as
aberdeen
in
england
we
went
to
manchester
birmingham
and
to
almost
every
city
town
and
even
village
of
importance
we
travelled
by
post
much
of
the
time
that
is
i
had
a
suitable
carriage
made
for
my
party
and
a
van
which
conveyed
the
general
s
carriage
ponies
and
such
other
property
as
was
needed
for
our
levees
and
we
never
had
the
slightest
difficulty
in
finding
good
post
horses
at
every
station
where
we
wanted
them
this
mode
of
travelling
was
not
only
very
comfortable
and
independent
but
it
enabled
us
to
visit
many
out
of
the
way
places
off
from
the
great
lines
of
travel
and
in
such
places
we
gave
some
of
our
most
successful
exhibitions
we
also
used
the
railway
lines
freely
leaving
our
carriages
at
any
station
and
taking
them
up
again
when
we
returned
i
remember
once
making
an
extraordinary
effort
to
reach
a
station
where
i
meant
to
leave
my
teams
and
take
the
rail
for
rugby
i
had
a
and
knew
at
what
hour
exactly
i
could
hit
the
train
but
unfortunately
the
axle
to
my
carriage
broke
and
as
an
hour
was
lost
in
repairing
it
i
lost
exactly
an
hour
in
reaching
the
station
the
train
had
long
been
gone
and
i
must
be
in
rugby
where
we
had
advertised
a
performance
i
stormed
around
till
i
found
the
superintendent
and
told
him
i
must
instantly
have
an
extra
train
to
extra
train
said
he
with
surprise
and
a
half
sneer
extra
train
why
you
can
t
have
an
extra
train
to
rugby
for
less
than
sixty
is
that
all
i
asked
well
get
up
your
train
immediately
and
here
are
your
sixty
pounds
what
in
the
world
are
sixty
pounds
to
me
when
i
wish
to
go
to
rugby
or
elsewhere
in
a
hurry
the
astonished
superintendent
took
the
money
bustled
about
and
the
train
was
soon
ready
he
was
greatly
puzzled
to
know
what
distinguished
person
he
thought
he
must
be
dealing
with
some
prince
or
at
least
a
duke
was
willing
to
give
so
much
money
to
save
a
few
hours
of
time
and
he
hesitatingly
asked
whom
he
had
the
honor
of
serving
general
tom
we
reached
rugby
in
time
to
give
our
performance
as
announced
and
our
receipts
were
which
quite
covered
the
expense
of
our
extra
train
and
left
a
handsome
margin
for
profit
when
we
were
in
oxford
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
students
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
the
general
was
a
little
fellow
the
admission
fee
to
his
entertainments
should
be
paid
in
the
smallest
kind
of
money
they
accordingly
provided
themselves
with
farthings
and
as
each
man
entered
instead
of
handing
in
a
shilling
for
his
ticket
he
laid
down
farthings
the
counting
of
these
small
coins
was
a
great
annoyance
to
stratton
the
general
s
father
who
was
ticket
seller
and
after
counting
two
or
three
handsful
vexed
at
the
delay
which
was
preventing
a
crowd
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
buying
tickets
stratton
lost
his
temper
and
cried
out
blast
your
quarter
pennies
i
am
not
going
to
count
them
you
chaps
who
haven
t
bigger
money
can
chuck
your
copper
into
my
hat
and
walk
at
cambridge
some
of
the
pretended
to
take
offence
because
our
would
not
permit
them
to
smoke
in
the
exhibition
hall
and
one
of
them
managed
to
involve
him
in
a
quarrel
which
ended
with
a
challenge
from
the
student
to
the
who
was
sure
he
must
fight
a
duel
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
and
as
he
expected
to
be
shot
he
suffered
the
greatest
mental
agony
about
midnight
however
after
he
had
been
sufficiently
scared
i
brought
him
the
gratifying
intelligence
that
i
had
succeeded
in
settling
the
dispute
his
gratitude
at
the
relief
thus
afforded
knew
no
bounds
stratton
was
a
genuine
yankee
and
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
yankee
vernacular
which
he
used
freely
in
exhibiting
the
general
i
often
said
to
visitors
that
tom
thumb
s
parents
and
the
rest
of
the
family
were
persons
of
the
ordinary
size
and
that
the
gentleman
who
presided
in
the
was
the
general
s
father
this
made
poor
stratton
an
object
of
no
little
curiosity
and
he
was
pestered
with
all
sorts
of
questions
on
one
occasion
an
old
dowager
said
to
him
are
you
really
the
father
of
general
tom
thumb
wa
al
replied
stratton
i
have
to
support
him
this
evasive
method
of
answering
is
common
enough
in
new
england
but
the
literal
dowager
had
her
doubts
and
promptly
rejoined
i
rather
think
he
supports
you
in
my
journeyings
through
england
i
always
tried
to
get
back
to
london
saturday
night
so
as
to
pass
sunday
with
my
family
and
to
meet
the
friends
whom
we
invited
to
dine
with
us
on
the
only
day
in
the
week
when
i
could
be
at
home
the
railway
facilities
are
so
excellent
in
england
that
no
matter
how
far
i
might
be
from
london
i
could
generally
reach
that
city
by
sunday
morning
and
yet
do
a
full
week
s
work
in
the
provinces
this
however
necessitated
travel
saturday
night
and
while
i
travelled
i
must
sleep
sleeping
cars
were
and
i
believe
still
are
unknown
in
that
country
but
i
travelled
so
much
and
was
by
this
time
so
well
known
to
the
guards
on
the
leading
lines
that
i
could
generally
secure
one
of
the
compartments
in
a
coach
to
myself
and
my
method
for
obtaining
a
good
night
s
sleep
was
to
lay
the
on
the
floor
of
the
car
thus
with
my
blanket
to
cover
me
making
a
tolerable
bed
on
one
of
these
saturday
night
excursions
i
lay
down
on
my
extemporized
couch
with
the
expectation
of
arriving
at
london
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
i
awoke
the
car
was
standing
still
and
the
sun
was
well
up
in
the
heavens
thinking
we
were
very
much
behind
time
and
wondering
why
the
train
did
not
go
on
at
last
i
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
to
my
utter
amazement
i
found
my
car
locked
up
in
a
yard
surrounded
by
a
high
fence
espying
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
charge
of
the
premises
i
shouted
to
him
to
come
and
let
me
out
of
the
car
which
was
also
locked
it
instantly
flashed
across
my
mind
that
at
this
station
the
guard
seeing
no
person
sitting
on
the
seats
in
the
car
and
concluding
that
it
was
empty
had
detached
it
from
the
train
and
switched
it
off
into
the
yard
the
astonished
man
whom
i
summoned
to
my
assistance
informed
me
that
i
was
sixty
miles
from
london
and
that
there
would
not
be
another
train
to
the
city
till
evening
it
was
ten
o
clock
and
i
was
to
have
been
home
at
five
i
raised
a
great
row
and
demanded
as
my
right
an
extra
train
to
carry
me
to
london
to
meet
the
friends
whom
it
was
i
should
see
that
day
i
had
to
wait
however
till
evening
and
i
arrived
home
at
seven
or
eight
o
clock
long
after
my
friends
had
gone
though
to
the
great
gratification
of
my
family
who
thought
some
serious
accident
must
have
happened
to
me
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
during
my
protracted
stay
abroad
i
confined
myself
wholly
to
business
or
limited
my
circle
of
observation
with
a
golden
rim
to
be
sure
i
ever
had
an
eye
to
business
but
i
had
also
two
eyes
for
observation
and
these
were
busily
employed
in
leisure
hours
i
made
the
most
of
my
opportunities
and
saw
hurriedly
it
is
true
nearly
everything
worth
seeing
in
the
various
places
which
i
visited
all
europe
was
a
great
curiosity
shop
to
me
and
i
willingly
paid
my
money
for
the
show
while
in
london
my
friend
albert
smith
a
jolly
companion
as
well
as
a
witty
and
sensible
author
promised
that
when
i
reached
birmingham
he
would
come
and
spend
a
day
with
me
in
including
a
visit
to
the
house
in
which
shakespeare
was
born
early
one
morning
in
the
autumn
of
my
friend
smith
and
myself
took
the
of
an
english
and
were
soon
whirling
at
the
rate
of
twelve
miles
an
hour
over
the
magnificent
road
leading
from
birmingham
to
stratford
the
distance
is
thirty
miles
at
a
little
village
four
miles
from
stratford
we
found
that
the
fame
of
the
bard
of
avon
had
travelled
thus
far
for
we
noticed
a
sign
over
a
miserable
barber
s
shop
shakespeare
a
good
shave
for
a
in
twenty
minutes
more
we
were
set
down
at
the
door
of
the
red
horse
hotel
in
stratford
the
coachman
and
guard
were
each
paid
half
a
crown
as
their
perquisites
while
breakfast
was
preparing
we
called
for
a
to
the
town
and
the
waiter
brought
in
a
book
saying
that
we
should
find
in
it
the
best
description
extant
of
the
birth
and
burial
place
of
shakespeare
i
was
not
a
little
proud
to
find
this
volume
to
be
no
other
than
the
of
our
illustrious
countryman
washington
irving
and
in
glancing
over
his
humorous
description
of
the
place
i
discovered
that
he
had
stopped
at
the
same
hotel
where
we
were
then
awaiting
breakfast
after
examining
the
shakespeare
house
as
well
as
the
tomb
and
the
church
in
which
all
that
is
mortal
of
the
great
poet
rests
we
ordered
a
for
warwick
castle
while
the
horses
were
harnessing
a
stopped
at
the
hotel
and
two
gentlemen
alighted
one
was
a
sedate
man
the
other
an
fop
the
former
was
mild
and
unassuming
in
his
manners
the
latter
was
all
talk
without
sense
or
meaning
in
fact
a
regular
charles
chatterbox
he
evidently
had
a
high
opinion
of
himself
and
was
determined
that
all
within
hearing
should
understand
that
he
was
somebody
presently
the
sedate
gentleman
said
edward
this
is
stratford
let
us
go
and
see
the
house
where
shakespeare
was
who
the
devil
is
shakespeare
asked
the
sensible
young
gentleman
our
was
at
the
door
we
leaped
into
it
and
were
off
leaving
the
nice
young
man
to
enjoy
a
visit
to
the
of
an
individual
of
whom
he
had
never
before
heard
the
distance
to
warwick
is
fourteen
miles
we
went
to
the
castle
and
approaching
the
door
of
the
great
hall
were
informed
by
a
porter
that
the
earl
of
warwick
and
family
were
absent
and
that
he
was
permitted
to
show
the
apartments
to
visitors
he
introduced
us
successively
into
the
red
the
cedar
the
gilt
room
the
state
lady
warwick
s
boudoir
the
compass
room
the
chapel
and
the
great
as
we
passed
out
of
the
castle
the
polite
porter
touched
his
head
he
of
course
had
no
hat
on
it
in
a
style
which
spoke
plainer
than
words
half
a
crown
each
if
you
please
we
responded
to
the
call
and
were
then
placed
in
charge
of
another
guide
who
took
us
to
the
top
of
guy
s
tower
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
touched
his
hat
a
shilling
s
worth
and
placing
ourselves
in
charge
of
a
third
conductor
an
old
man
of
seventy
we
proceeded
to
the
greenhouse
to
see
the
warwick
vase
each
guide
announcing
at
the
end
of
his
short
tour
gentlemen
i
go
no
farther
and
indicating
that
the
bill
for
his
services
was
to
be
paid
the
old
gentleman
mounted
a
rostrum
at
the
side
of
the
vase
and
commenced
a
set
speech
which
we
began
to
fear
was
interminable
so
tossing
him
the
usual
fee
we
left
him
in
the
middle
of
his
oration
passing
through
the
porter
s
lodge
on
our
way
out
under
the
impression
that
we
had
seen
all
that
was
interesting
the
old
porter
informed
us
that
the
most
curious
things
connected
with
the
castle
were
to
be
seen
in
his
lodge
feeling
for
our
coin
we
bade
him
produce
his
relics
and
he
showed
us
a
lot
of
trumpery
which
he
gravely
informed
us
belonged
to
that
hero
of
antiquity
guy
earl
of
warwick
among
these
were
his
sword
shield
helmet
and
each
of
enormous
size
the
horse
armor
nearly
large
enough
for
an
elephant
a
large
pot
which
would
hold
seventy
gallons
called
guy
s
porridge
pot
his
the
size
of
a
farmer
s
his
lady
s
stirrups
the
rib
of
a
mastodon
which
the
porter
pretended
belonged
to
the
great
dun
cow
which
according
to
tradition
haunted
a
ditch
near
coventry
and
after
doing
injury
to
many
persons
was
slain
by
the
valiant
guy
the
sword
weighed
nearly
pounds
and
the
armor
pounds
i
told
the
old
porter
he
was
entitled
to
great
credit
for
having
concentrated
more
lies
than
i
had
ever
before
heard
in
so
small
a
compass
he
smiled
and
evidently
felt
gratified
by
the
compliment
i
suppose
i
continued
that
you
have
told
these
marvellous
stories
so
often
that
you
believe
them
yourself
almost
replied
the
porter
with
a
grin
of
satisfaction
that
showed
he
was
up
to
snuff
and
had
really
earned
two
shillings
come
now
old
fellow
said
i
what
will
you
take
for
the
entire
lot
of
those
traps
i
want
them
for
my
museum
in
no
money
would
buy
these
valuable
historical
mementos
of
a
age
replied
the
old
porter
with
a
leer
never
mind
i
exclaimed
i
ll
have
them
duplicated
for
my
museum
so
that
americans
can
see
them
and
avoid
the
necessity
of
coming
here
and
in
that
way
i
ll
burst
up
your
albert
smith
laughed
immoderately
at
the
astonishment
of
the
porter
when
i
made
this
threat
and
i
was
greatly
amused
some
years
afterwards
when
albert
smith
became
a
successful
showman
and
was
exhibiting
his
mont
blanc
to
delighted
audiences
in
london
to
discover
that
he
had
introduced
this
very
incident
into
his
lecture
of
course
changing
the
names
and
locality
he
often
confessed
that
he
derived
his
very
first
idea
of
becoming
a
showman
from
my
talk
about
the
business
and
my
doings
on
this
charming
day
when
we
visited
warwick
the
warwick
races
were
coming
off
that
day
within
half
a
mile
of
the
village
and
we
therefore
went
down
and
spent
an
hour
with
the
multitude
there
was
very
little
excitement
regarding
the
races
and
we
concluded
to
take
a
tour
through
the
penny
shows
the
vans
of
which
lined
one
side
of
the
course
for
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
applying
to
enter
one
van
which
had
a
large
pictorial
sign
of
giantesses
white
negro
albino
girls
learned
pig
big
snakes
the
keeper
exclaimed
come
mister
you
is
the
man
what
hired
randall
the
giant
for
merika
and
you
shows
tom
thumb
now
can
you
think
of
paying
less
than
sixpence
for
going
in
here
the
appeal
was
irresistible
so
satisfying
his
demands
we
entered
upon
coming
out
a
whole
bevy
of
showmen
from
that
and
neighboring
vans
surrounded
me
and
began
descanting
on
the
merits
and
demerits
of
general
tom
thumb
oh
says
one
i
knows
two
dwarfs
what
is
better
ten
times
as
tom
yes
says
another
there

no
use
to
talk
about
tom
thumb
while
melia
patton
is
above
the
now
i
ve
seen
tom
thumb
added
a
third
and
he
is
a
fine
little
squab
but
the
only
vantage
he
s
got
is
he
can
chaff
so
well
he
chaffs
like
a
man
but
i
can
learn
dick
swift
in
two
months
so
that
he
can
chaff
tom
thumb
never

added
a
fourth

got
a
chap
training
what

the
thumbs

exclaimed
a
fifth
for

name
and
you
all
know
the
name
s
everything
tom
thumb
couldn
t
never
shine
even
in
my
van
long
side
of
a
dozen
dwarfs
i
knows
if
this
yankee
hadn
t
bamboozled
our
queen
god
bless
her
by
getting
him
afore
her
half
a
dozen
yes

that
s
the
ticket
exclaimed
another
our
queen
patronizes
everything
foreign
and
yet
she
wouldn
t
visit
my
beautiful
to
save
the
crown
of
your
beautiful
they
all
exclaimed
with
a
hearty
laugh
yes
and
who
says
they
haint
beautiful
retorted
the
other
they
was
made
by
the
best
hitalian
hartist
in
this
they
was
made
by
jim
caul
and
showed
all
over
the
country
twenty
years
ago
rejoined
another
and
arter
that
they
laid
five
years
in
pawn
in
old
moll
wiggin
s
cellar
covered
with
mould
and
well
that
s
a
good
un
that
is
replied
the
proprietor
of
the
beautiful
with
a
look
of
disdain
i
made
a
move
to
depart
when
one
of
the
head
showmen
exclaimed
come
mister
don
t
be
shabby
can
you
think
of
going
without
standing
treat
all
round
why
should
i
stand
treat
i
asked
cause
tain
t
every
day
you
can
meet
such
a
bloody
lot
of
jolly
replied
i
handed
out
a
crown
and
left
them
to
drink
bad
luck
to
the
foreign
wagabonds
what
would
bamboozle
their
queen
with
inferior
dwarfs
possessing
no
advantage
over
the
natyves
but
the
power
of
while
in
the
showmen
s
vans
seeking
for
acquisitions
to
my
museum
in
america
i
was
struck
with
the
tall
appearance
of
a
couple
of
females
who
exhibited
as
the
canadian
giantesses
each
seven
feet
in
suspecting
that
a
cheat
was
hidden
under
their
unfashionably
long
dresses
which
reached
to
the
floor
and
thus
rendered
their
feet
invisible
i
attempted
to
solve
the
mystery
by
raising
a
foot
or
two
of
the
superfluous
covering
the
strapping
young
lady
not
relishing
such
liberties
from
a
stranger
laid
me
flat
upon
the
floor
with
a
blow
from
her
brawny
hand
i
was
on
my
feet
again
in
tolerably
quick
time
but
not
until
i
had
discovered
that
she
stood
upon
a
pedestal
at
least
eighteen
inches
high
we
returned
to
the
hotel
took
a
and
drove
through
decidedly
the
most
lovely
country
i
ever
beheld
since
taking
that
tour
i
have
heard
that
two
gentlemen
once
made
a
bet
each
that
he
could
name
the
most
delightful
drive
in
england
many
persons
were
present
and
the
two
gentlemen
wrote
on
separate
slips
of
paper
the
scene
which
he
most
admired
one
gentleman
wrote
the
road
from
warwick
to
coventry
the
other
had
written
the
road
from
coventry
to
in
less
than
an
hour
we
were
set
down
at
the
outer
walls
of
kenilworth
castle
which
scott
has
greatly
aided
to
immortalize
in
his
celebrated
novel
of
that
name
this
once
noble
and
magnificent
castle
is
now
a
stupendous
ruin
which
has
been
so
often
described
that
i
think
it
unnecessary
to
say
anything
about
it
here
we
spent
half
an
hour
in
examining
the
interesting
ruins
and
then
proceeded
by
to
coventry
a
distance
of
six
or
eight
miles
here
we
remained
four
hours
during
which
time
we
visited
mary
s
hall
which
has
attracted
the
notice
of
many
antiquaries
we
also
took
our
own
peep
at
the
effigy
of
the
celebrated
peeping
tom
after
which
we
visited
an
exhibition
called
the
happy
family
consisting
of
about
two
hundred
birds
and
animals
of
opposite
natures
and
propensities
all
living
in
harmony
together
in
one
cage
this
exhibition
was
so
remarkable
that
i
bought
it
and
hired
the
proprietor
to
accompany
it
to
new
york
and
it
became
an
attractive
feature
in
my
museum
we
took
the
cars
the
same
evening
for
birmingham
where
we
arrived
at
ten
o
clock
albert
smith
remarking
that
never
before
in
his
life
had
he
accomplished
a
day
s
journey
on
the
yankee
principle
he
afterwards
published
a
chapter
in
s
entitled
a
day
with
barnum
in
which
he
said
we
accomplished
business
with
such
rapidity
that
when
he

end
of
our

departure
for

arrival
in
new

while
i
was
at
aberdeen
in
scotland
i
met
anderson
the
wizard
of
the
i
had
known
him
for
a
long
time
and
we
were
on
familiar
terms
the
general
s
exhibitions
were
to
close
on
saturday
night
and
anderson
was
to
open
in
the
same
hall
on
monday
evening
he
came
to
our
exhibition
and
at
the
close
we
went
to
the
hotel
together
to
get
a
little
supper
after
supper
we
were
having
some
fun
and
jokes
together
when
it
occurred
to
anderson
to
introduce
me
to
several
persons
who
were
sitting
in
the
room
as
the
wizard
of
the
north
at
the
same
time
asking
me
about
my
tricks
and
my
forthcoming
exhibition
he
kept
this
up
so
persistently
that
some
of
our
friends
who
were
present
declared
that
anderson
was
too
much
for
me
and
meanwhile
fresh
introductions
to
strangers
who
came
in
had
made
me
pretty
generally
known
in
that
circle
as
the
wizard
of
the
north
who
was
to
astonish
the
town
in
the
following
week
i
accepted
the
situation
at
last
and
said
well
gentlemen
as
i
perform
here
for
the
first
time
on
monday
evening
i
like
to
be
liberal
and
i
should
be
very
happy
to
give
orders
of
admission
to
those
of
you
who
will
attend
my
the
applications
for
orders
were
quite
general
and
i
had
written
thirty
or
forty
when
anderson
who
saw
that
i
was
in
a
fair
way
of
filling
his
house
with
cried
out
hold
on
i
am
the
wizard
of
the
i
ll
stand
the
orders
already
given
but
not
another
our
friends
including
the
wizard
himself
began
to
think
that
i
had
rather
the
best
of
the
joke
during
our
three
years
stay
abroad
i
made
a
second
hasty
visit
to
america
leaving
the
general
in
england
in
the
hands
of
my
agents
i
took
passage
from
liverpool
on
board
a
cunard
steamer
commanded
by
captain
judkins
one
of
my
fellow
passengers
was
the
celebrated
divine
robert
baird
i
had
known
him
as
the
author
of
an
octavo
volume
religion
in
america
and
while
that
work
had
impressed
me
as
exhibiting
great
ability
and
an
outspoken
honesty
of
purpose
it
had
also
given
me
the
notion
that
its
author
must
be
very
rigid
and
intolerant
as
a
sectarian
still
i
was
happy
to
make
his
acquaintance
on
board
the
steamship
and
soon
regarded
with
favor
the
venerable
presbyterian
divine
baird
had
been
for
some
time
a
missionary
in
sweden
he
was
now
paying
a
visit
to
his
native
land
i
found
him
a
shrewd
christian
gentleman
and
i
took
much
pleasure
in
hearing
him
converse
one
night
it
was
storming
furiously
the
waves
rolling
high
afforded
a
sight
of
awful
grandeur
to
witness
which
i
was
tempted
to
put
on
a
go
upon
the
deck
and
lash
myself
to
the
side
of
the
ship
after
i
had
been
there
nearly
an
hour
wrapt
in
meditation
and
wonder
not
unmixed
with
awe
baird
came
up
in
the
darkness
feeling
his
way
cautiously
along
the
deck
as
he
came
where
i
was
i
hailed
him
and
he
asked
what
i
was
doing
so
long
up
there
listening
to
the
preaching
doctor
i
replied
and
i
think
it
beats
even
yours
although
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
ah
he
replied
none
of
us
can
preach
like
this
how
humble
and
insignificant
we
all
feel
in
the
presence
of
such
a
display
of
the
almighty
power
and
how
grateful
we
should
be
to
remember
that
infinite
love
guides
this
the
sunday
following
divine
service
was
held
as
usual
in
the
large
after
cabin
of
course
it
was
the
episcopal
form
of
worship
the
captain
conducted
the
services
assisted
by
the
clerk
and
the
ship
s
surgeon
a
dozen
or
two
of
the
sailors
shaved
washed
and
neatly
dressed
were
marched
into
the
cabin
by
the
mate
most
of
the
passengers
were
also
present
those
who
have
witnessed
this
service
as
conducted
by
captain
judkins
need
not
be
reminded
that
he
does
it
much
as
he
performs
his
duties
on
deck
he
speaks
as
one
having
authority
and
a
listener
could
hardly
help
feeling
that
there
would
be
some
danger
of
a
row
if
the
petitions
made
as
a
sort
of
command
were
not
speedily
answered
after
dinner
i
asked
baird
if
he
would
be
willing
to
preach
to
the
passengers
in
the
forward
cabin
he
said
he
would
cheerfully
do
so
if
it
was
desired
i
mentioned
it
to
the
passengers
and
there
was
a
wish
among
them
that
he
should
preach
i
went
into
the
forward
cabin
and
requested
the
steward
to
arrange
the
chairs
and
tables
properly
for
religious
service
he
replied
that
i
must
first
get
the
captain
s
consent
of
course
i
thought
this
was
a
mere
matter
of
form
so
i
went
to
the
captain
s
office
and
said
captain
the
passengers
desire
to
have
baird
conduct
a
religious
service
in
the
forward
cabin
i
suppose
there
is
no
decidedly
there
is
replied
the
captain
gruffly
and
it
will
not
be
why
not
i
asked
in
astonishment
it
is
against
the
rules
of
the
what
to
have
religious
services
on
board
there
have
been
religious
services
once
and
that
is
enough
if
the
passengers
do
not
think
that
is
good
enough
let
them
go
without
was
the
captain
s
hasty
and
austere
reply
captain
i
replied
do
you
pretend
to
say
you
will
not
allow
a
respectable
and
clergyman
to
offer
a
prayer
and
hold
religious
services
on
board
your
ship
at
the
request
of
your
passengers
that
sir
is
exactly
what
i
say
so
now
let
me
hear
no
more
about
by
this
time
a
dozen
passengers
were
crowding
around
his
door
and
expressing
their
surprise
at
his
conduct
i
was
indignant
and
used
sharp
language
well
said
i
this
is
the
most
contemptible
thing
i
ever
heard
of
on
the
part
of
the
owners
of
a
public
illustration
me
in
passenger
ship
their
meanness
ought
to
be
published
far
and
you
had
better
shut
up
said
captain
judkins
with
great
sternness
i
will
not
shut
up
i
replied
for
this
thing
is
perfectly
outrageous
in
that
forward
cabin
you
allow
on
week
days
gambling
swearing
smoking
and
singing
till
late
at
night
and
yet
on
sunday
you
have
the
impudence
to
deny
the
privilege
of
a
conducted
by
a
and
respected
minister
of
the
gospel
it
is
simply
infamous
captain
judkins
turned
red
in
the
face
and
no
doubt
feeling
that
he
was
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
if
you
repeat
such
language
i
will
put
you
in
do
it
if
you
dare
said
i
feeling
my
indignation
rising
rapidly
i
dare
and
defy
you
to
put
your
finger
on
me
i
would
like
to
sail
into
new
york
harbor
in
handcuffs
on
board
a
british
ship
for
the
terrible
crime
of
asking
that
religious
worship
may
be
permitted
on
board
so
you
may
try
it
as
soon
as
you
please
and
when
we
get
to
new
york
i
ll
show
you
a
touch
of
yankee
ideas
of
religious
the
captain
made
no
reply
and
at
the
request
of
friends
i
walked
to
another
part
of
the
ship
i
told
the
doctor
how
the
matter
stood
and
then
laughingly
said
to
him
doctor
it
may
be
dangerous
for
you
to
tell
of
this
incident
when
you
get
on
shore
for
it
would
be
a
pretty
strong
draught
upon
the
credulity
of
many
of
my
countrymen
if
they
were
told
that
my
zeal
to
hear
an
orthodox
minister
preach
was
so
great
that
it
came
near
getting
me
into
solitary
confinement
but
i
am
not
prejudiced
and
i
like
fair
the
old
doctor
replied
well
you
have
not
lost
much
and
if
the
rules
of
this
ship
are
so
stringent
i
suppose
we
must
the
captain
and
myself
had
no
further
intercourse
for
five
or
six
days
not
until
a
few
hours
before
our
arrival
in
new
york
being
at
dinner
he
sent
his
champagne
bottle
to
me
and
asked
to
drink
my
health
at
the
same
time
stating
that
he
hoped
no
would
be
carried
ashore
i
was
not
then
as
i
am
now
a
teetotaler
so
i
accepted
the
proffered
truce
and
i
regret
that
i
must
add
i
washed
down
my
wrath
in
a
bottle
of
heidsick
a
poor
example
which
i
hope
never
to
repeat
we
have
frequently
met
since
and
always
with
friendly
greetings
but
i
have
ever
felt
that
his
manners
were
unnecessarily
coarse
and
offensive
in
carrying
out
an
arbitrary
and
bigoted
rule
of
the
steamship
company
though
i
have
never
lacked
definite
opinions
or
hesitated
to
exhibit
decided
preferences
in
regard
to
the
different
religious
creeds
i
have
never
been
so
sectarian
as
to
imagine
that
any
one
of
the
denominations
is
without
any
truth
or
exists
for
no
good
purpose
on
the
contrary
i
hold
that
every
faith
has
somewhat
of
truth
and
that
each
sect
in
its
way
does
a
work
which
perhaps
no
one
of
the
other
sects
can
do
as
well
i
was
strongly
confirmed
in
this
general
belief
by
an
impromptu
utterance
of
baird
during
one
of
our
conversations
which
under
the
circumstances
was
not
a
little
amusing
as
it
certainly
evinced
a
good
deal
of
insight
into
human
nature
it
is
well
known
that
the
old
doctor
was
very
rigid
in
his
theological
views
and
in
his
career
never
spared
either
the
methodists
or
the
people
of
the
liberal
opinions
during
our
passage
across
the
atlantic
we
very
naturally
had
considerable
tilting
in
regard
to
opinions
which
divided
us
though
in
a
thoroughly
way
at
last
i
recalled
the
case
of
a
woman
somewhat
noted
among
her
neighbors
for
coarseness
of
speech
including
profanity
making
her
altogether
such
a
person
as
needed
the
refining
influence
of
religious
teaching
describing
the
very
unpromising
condition
of
this
woman
i
said
well
doctor
if
you
can
do
anything
with
your
creed
to
improve
that
woman
i
should
be
glad
to
see
you
undertake
the
i
was
at
once
struck
with
the
business
air
in
which
he
considered
the
exigencies
of
what
was
undoubtedly
a
hard
case
it
was
clear
that
he
had
dropped
the
character
of
the
sectarian
and
was
taking
a
view
of
the
problem
the
problem
was
soon
solved
and
he
replied
mr
barnum
it
is
of
no
use
for
you
with
your
opinions
to
attempt
to
do
anything
for
that
sort
of
a
person
and
it
is
equally
useless
for
me
with
my
views
to
attempt
it
either
but
if
you
could
contrive
a
way
to
set
some
fiery
rousing
methodist
to
work
upon
her
why
he
is
just
the
man
to
do
it
there
were
a
number
of
pretty
wild
young
men
among
our
passengers
and
on
several
occasions
they
tried
their
wits
upon
baird
but
he
was
a
man
of
sterling
common
sense
and
with
that
very
quick
at
repartee
and
they
never
made
anything
out
of
him
on
one
occasion
at
dinner
they
were
in
great
glee
and
for
a
lark
they
sent
him
their
champagne
bottle
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
them
they
of
course
supposed
he
was
a
teetotaler
as
indeed
i
believe
he
was
but
when
the
waiter
handed
him
the
bottle
he
quietly
poured
a
spoonful
or
two
into
his
glass
and
gracefully
bowing
to
the
young
gentlemen
placed
it
to
his
lips
but
not
tasting
it
of
course
they
could
say
nothing
early
one
morning
several
of
these
youths
came
upon
deck
and
meeting
the
doctor
there
one
of
them
exclaimed
it
is
cold
as
hell
this
morning
ain
t
it
doctor
i
am
unable
to
state
the
exact
height
of
the
thermometer
in
that
locality
said
he
gravely
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
know
all
about
it
some
time
if
you
are
not
the
laugh
was
decidedly
against
the
young
man
but
one
of
his
companions
who
thought
considerably
of
himself
seemed
anxious
to
take
up
the
cudgel
and
he
remarked
dr
baird
your
brother
clergymen
are
making
a
great
ado
in
new
york
about
the
state
of
crime
there
and
they
have
got
a
who
go
about
and
smell
out
all
filthy
places
there
and
report
them
to
the
public
indeed
they
do
say
that
several
of
the
clergy
and
some
laymen
of
the
arthur
tappan
stripe
have
got
a
book
in
which
they
have
written
down
a
list
of
all
the
bad
houses
in
new
york
i
should
like
to
see
that
book
ha
ha
i
wonder
if
they
have
really
got
one
i
don
t
know
how
that
is
replied
doctor
baird
but
casting
his
eyes
heavenward
i
can
assure
you
there
is
a
book
in
which
all
such
places
are
recorded
as
well
as
the
names
of
those
who
occupy
or
visit
them
and
in
due
time
it
will
be
opened
to
public
the
young
man
looked
cowed
and
extending
his
hand
to
doctor
baird
said
sir
i
confess
i
have
made
too
light
of
a
serious
matter
i
sincerely
beg
your
pardon
if
i
have
offended
you
have
not
offended
me
said
the
doctor
with
a
benignant
smile
but
i
am
rejoiced
to
perceive
that
you
have
offended
your
own
sense
of
propriety
and
morality
i
trust
you
will
not
forget
this
was
the
last
attempt
on
board
that
ship
to
try
a
lance
with
doctor
baird
several
years
later
when
i
was
engaged
in
the
jenny
lind
enterprise
doctor
baird
called
upon
me
having
been
so
long
a
missionary
in
sweden
the
native
land
of
the
great
songstress
he
had
a
special
desire
to
make
her
acquaintance
and
listen
to
her
singing
i
introduced
him
to
her
and
gave
him
the
to
her
concerts
he
improved
the
opportunity
and
he
also
made
frequent
calls
upon
her
she
became
much
interested
in
him
indeed
on
several
occasions
she
contributed
liberally
to
the
charitable
institutions
he
had
recommended
to
her
favorable
notice
during
my
residence
in
london
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
american
whom
i
will
call
simpson
and
his
wife
they
had
originally
been
poor
and
accustomed
to
pretty
low
society
their
opportunities
for
education
had
been
limited
and
they
were
what
we
should
term
vulgar
ignorant
common
people
but
by
a
turn
of
fortune
s
wheel
they
became
suddenly
rich
and
like
some
other
fools
who
know
nothing
of
their
own
country
they
must
rush
to
make
the
tour
of
europe
simpson
was
an
ignorant
fellow
fond
of
sporting
large
amounts
of
jewelry
was
very
social
with
englishmen
always
bragging
of
our
glorious
country
and
was
particularly
given
to
boasting
that
he
was
once
poor
and
now
he
was
rich
whenever
he
met
americans
he
was
delighted
and
insisted
on
the
privilege
of
standing
treats
to
all
around
familiarly
slapping
on
the
back
and
treating
as
an
old
chum
any
american
gentleman
however
refined
whom
he
might
come
in
contact
with
simpson
was
a
coarse
woman
yet
always
studying
politeness
and
particularly
the
proper
pronunciation
of
words
she
was
ever
trying
to
appear
refined
and
she
prided
herself
upon
understanding
all
the
rules
of
etiquette
and
fashion
she
was
continually
purchasing
new
dresses
and
fashionable
articles
of
apparel
she
loaded
herself
down
with
diamonds
and
tawdry
jewelry
and
would
frequently
appear
in
the
streets
with
six
or
eight
different
dresses
in
a
day
but
strange
to
say
with
all
her
pride
and
vanity
with
regard
to
being
considered
the
perfection
of
refinement
she
had
an
awful
habit
of
using
profane
language
she
really
seemed
to
think
this
an
evidence
of
good
breeding
perhaps
she
thought
it
a
luxury
which
rich
people
were
entitled
to
enjoy
this
peculiarity
occasionally
led
to
most
ludicrous
scenes
the
simpsons
were
from
new
england
and
in
their
conversation
they
had
the
nasal
yankee
twang
and
the
peculiar
pronunciation
of
the
illiterate
class
of
the
new
england
people
those
who
have
heard
john
owens
in
solon
shingle
are
aware
that
preserved
fruits
are
in
new
england
called
sauce
by
the
vulgar
pronounced
but
when
simpson
heard
the
word
in
england
pronounced
sauce
she
was
very
anxious
that
john
her
husband
should
adopt
the
new
pronunciation
he
tried
hard
to
learn
but
would
frequently
forget
himself
and
say
simpson
would
lose
her
patience
on
such
occasions
and
reprove
her
husband
sharply
indeed
if
he
escaped
without
receiving
some
profane
epithet
from
the
lips
of
his
fashionable
wife
it
was
a
wonder
on
one
occasion
i
happened
to
meet
them
at
dinner
with
an
english
family
in
london
to
whom
i
had
in
the
way
of
business
introduced
them
a
few
weeks
previously
we
had
scarcely
taken
our
seats
at
the
table
before
simpson
happened
to
discover
a
dish
of
sweetmeats
at
the
further
corner
of
the
table
turning
to
the
servant
he
said
please
pass
me
that
simpson
s
eyes
flashed
indignantly
and
she
angrily
exclaimed
almost
in
a
scream
say
sauce
don
t
say
i
d
rather
hear
you
say
h
l
a
d
d
sight
that
our
english
hostess
was
amazed
and
shocked
it
is
needless
to
say
although
she
preserved
her
equanimity
better
than
could
be
expected
as
for
myself
i
confess
i
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
which
of
course
served
only
to
increase
the
wrath
of
simpson
fourteen
years
subsequent
to
this
event
i
called
on
this
english
lady
in
company
with
an
american
friend
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
happened
to
ask
her
if
she
remembered
about
simpson
s
she
took
from
a
drawer
her
memorandum
book
and
showed
us
the
above
expression
verbatim
which
she
said
she
wrote
down
the
same
day
it
was
uttered
and
she
added
she
had
never
been
able
to
think
of
it
since
without
laughing
i
met
simpson
and
his
wife
at
a
hotel
in
marseilles
france
in
the
summer
of
simpson
said
she
and
simpson
had
almost
determined
not
to
go
to
france
at
all
when
they
heard
it
was
necessary
to
hire
an
interpreter
to
tell
what
folks
said
she
i
told
simpson
i
didn
t
want
to
go
among
a
set
of
folks
who
were
such
cussed
fools
they
couldn
t
speak
english
but
of
course
we
must
go
to
france
just
for
the
speech
of
the
people
when
we
get
home
so
here
we
are
for
my
part
she
continued
i
speak
english
to
these
frenchmen
anyhow
and
if
they
can
t
understand
me
they
can
go
without
understanding
the
other
morning
i
told
the
waiter
my
tea
was
too
sweet
i
found
afterwards
that
too
sweet
de
was
french
for
very
oui
madame
he
replied
oui
oui
que
voulez
vous
what
will
you
have
too
sweet
too
sweet
i
repeated
too
sweet
too
then
i
pointed
to
my
tea
and
said
again
too
sweet
d
n
your
stupid
head
can
t
you
understand
too
sweet
the
fool
jumped
around
like
a
hen
with
her
head
cut
off
and
kept
saying
oui
oui
madame
too
sweet
qu
est
ceque
c
est
what
is
it
finally
an
english
gentleman
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
and
when
i
told
him
he
explained
by
telling
me
that
toute
de
suite
in
french
meant
quick
very
quick
and
that
was
what
made
the
stupid
waiter
jump
around
but
d
n
the
french
waiters
she
continued
i
have
got
quit
of
them
finally
for
i
have
found
out
a
language
we
both
understand
the
same
day
my
tea
was
too
sweet
simpson
was
out
at
dinner
time
and
i
went
to
the
table
alone
i
called
for
soup
and
the
brought
me
some
sort
of
preserves
i
then
called
for
fish
and
the
fools
could
not
understand
me
then
i
said
bring
me
some
chicken
and
d
n
em
they
danced
about
in
a
quandary
till
i
thought
i
should
starve
to
death
but
finally
i
thought
of
roast
duck
i
am
dreadfully
fond
of
duck
and
i
knew
they
always
had
stuffed
ducks
at
dinner
time
so
i
called
to
the
waiter
once
more
and
pointed
to
my
plate
and
said
now
do
you
understand
and
the
fool
began
to
laugh
and
said
oui
madame
oui
oui
and
off
he
ran
and
soon
brought
me
the
nicest
piece
of
duck
you
ever
saw
so
now
every
day
at
dinner
i
say
and
i
always
get
some
i
congratulated
her
on
having
discovered
a
universal
language
the
same
day
i
met
a
young
englishman
in
the
hotel
who
had
been
travelling
in
spain
during
our
conversation
we
were
summoned
to
dinner
at
the
table
d
hote
simpson
happened
to
be
seated
exactly
opposite
us
as
we
continued
our
conversation
simpson
heard
it
and
his
attention
was
particularly
arrested
it
being
something
of
a
novelty
to
meet
a
stranger
in
these
parts
who
spoke
our
native
tongue
the
english
gentleman
mentioned
that
he
ascended
the
pyrenees
the
week
previous
i
should
like
to
have
been
with
you
i
remarked
but
i
am
almost
too
fat
and
lazy
to
climb
high
mountains
i
suppose
you
found
it
pretty
hard
yes
we
had
to
rough
it
some
we
encountered
considerable
snow
he
replied
snow
exclaimed
simpson
in
astonishment
the
englishman
looked
with
surprise
at
this
interruption
for
he
did
not
know
simpson
nor
had
he
ever
heard
him
speak
before
however
he
quietly
replied
yes
sir
not
by
a
d
d
sight
you
didn
t
replied
simpson
emphatically
that
wont
go
down
snow
in
august
wont
do
i
have
seen
snow
myself
in
connecticut
the
last
of
september
but
it
wont
do
in
august
by
a
thundering
the
englishman
sprang
to
his
feet
but
i
hit
him
a
nudge
and
said
it
is
all
right
excuse
me
let
me
introduce
my
friend
simpson
from
america
he
has
travelled
some
and
it
is
pretty
hard
to
take
him
in
with
big
he
comprehended
the
matter
instantly
and
sat
down
yes
sir
remarked
simpson
i
have
heard
travellers
before
but
august
is
a
leetle
too
early
for
but
suppose
i
should
say
it
was
not
this
year
s
snow
said
the
englishman
who
was
ready
now
to
carry
on
the
joke
worse
and
worse
exclaimed
simpson
with
a
triumphant
laugh
if
it
would
not
melt
in
august
when
in
thunder
would
it
melt
you
might
as
well
say
it
would
lay
all
the
year
i
give
it
up
said
the
englishman
you
are
too
sharp
for
simpson
was
delighted
and
took
special
pains
for
several
days
to
inform
the
interpreters
in
the
neighboring
hotels
and
billiard
saloons
that
he
had
took
down
an
impudent
john
bull
who
had
tried
to
stuff
him
with
the
idea
that
he
had
seen
snow
in
august
i
met
the
simpsons
afterwards
in
brussels
and
the
head
of
the
family
who
had
heard
nothing
but
french
spoken
outside
of
his
own
circle
for
a
long
time
called
me
in
great
glee
to
the
door
to
see
and
hear
some
dutchmen
who
were
conversing
together
in
the
street
there
exclaimed
simpson
those
fellows
are
dutchmen
i
know
by
their
very
well
said
i
how
far
do
you
suppose
those
dutchmen
are
from
their
native
place
why
replied
simpson
i
suppose
they
came
from
western
pennsylvania
that
s
where
i
have
always
seen
with
the
exception
of
the
brief
time
passed
in
making
two
short
visits
to
america
i
had
now
passed
three
years
with
general
tom
thumb
in
great
britain
and
on
the
continent
the
entire
period
had
been
a
season
of
unbroken
pleasure
and
profit
i
had
immensely
enlarged
my
business
experiences
and
had
made
money
and
many
friends
among
those
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
special
courtesies
while
i
was
abroad
are
brewster
whose
prosperous
professional
career
in
russia
and
france
is
well
known
and
henry
sumner
who
occupied
a
high
position
in
the
social
and
literary
circles
of
paris
and
who
introduced
me
to
george
sand
and
to
many
other
distinguished
persons
to
both
these
gentlemen
as
well
as
to
john
nimmo
an
english
gentleman
connected
with
s
lorenzo
draper
the
american
consul
and
dion
boucicault
i
was
largely
indebted
for
attention
in
london
two
gentlemen
especially

my
warm
acknowledgments
for
many
valuable
favors
i
refer
to
the
late
thomas
brettell
publisher
haymarket
and
fillingham
fenchurch
street
i
was
also
indebted
to
putnam

that
time
a
london
publisher
for
much
useful
information
we
had
visited
nearly
every
city
and
town
in
france
and
belgium
all
the
principal
places
in
england
and
scotland
besides
going
to
belfast
and
dublin
in
ireland
i
had
several
times
met
daniel
o
connell
in
private
life
and
in
the
irish
capital

heard
him
make
an
eloquent
and
powerful
public
repeal
speech
in

hall
in
dublin
after
exhibiting
a
week
in
rotunda
hall
our
receipts

the
general
also
received

at
the

thus
closing
a
truly

one
of
my
main
objects
in
returning
home
at
this
time
was
to
obtain
a
longer
lease
of
the
premises
occupied
by
the
american
museum
my
lease
had
still
three
years
to
run
but
olmsted
the
proprietor
of
the
building
was
dead
and
i
was
anxious
to
make
provision
in
time
for
the
perpetuity
of
my
establishment
for
i
meant
to
make
the
museum
a
permanent
institution
in
the
city
and
if
i
could
not
renew
my
lease
i
intended
to
build
an
appropriate
edifice
on
broadway
i
finally
succeeded
however
in
getting
the
lease
of
the
entire
building
covering
feet
by
one
hundred
for
years
at
an
annual
rent
of
and
the
ordinary
taxes
and
assessments
i
had
already
hired
in
addition
the
upper
stories
of
three
adjoining
buildings
my
museum
receipts
were
more
in
one
day
than
they
formerly
were
in
an
entire
week
and
the
establishment
had
become
so
popular
that
it
was
thronged
at
all
hours
from
early
morning
to
closing
time
at
night
on
my
return
i
promptly
made
use
of
general
tom
thumb
s
european
reputation
he
immediately
appeared
in
the
american
museum
and
for
four
weeks
drew
such
crowds
of
visitors
as
had
never
been
seen
there
before
he
afterwards
spent
a
month
in
bridgeport
with
his
kindred
to
prevent
being
annoyed
by
the
curious
who
would
be
sure
to
throng
the
houses
of
his
relatives
he
exhibited
two
days
at
bridgeport
the
receipts
amounting
to
several
hundred
dollars
were
presented
to
the
bridgeport
charitable
society
the
bridgeporters
were
much
delighted
to
see
their
old
friend
little
charlie
again
they
little
thought
when
they
saw
him
playing
about
the
streets
a
few
years
previously
that
he
was
destined
to
create
such
a
sensation
among
the
crowned
heads
of
the
old
world
and
now
returning
with
his
european
reputation
he
was
of
course
a
great
curiosity
to
his
former
acquaintances
as
well
as
to
the
public
generally
his
bridgeport
friends
found
that
he
had
not
increased
in
size
during
the
four
and
a
half
years
of
his
absence
but
they
discovered
that
he
had
become
sharp
and
witty
abounding
in
foreign
airs
and
native
graces
in
fact
that
he
was
quite
unlike
the
little
diffident
country
fellow
whom
they
had
formerly
known
we
never
thought
charlie
much
of
a
phenomenon
when
he
lived
among
us
said
one
of
the
first
citizens
of
the
place
but
now
that
he
has
become
barnumized
he
is
a
rare
but
there
was
really
no
mystery
about
it
the
whole
change
made
by
training
and
travel
had
appeared
to
me
by
degrees
and
it
came
to
the
citizens
of
bridgeport
suddenly
the
terms
upon
which
i
first
engaged
the
lad
showed
that
i
had
no
expectations
of
his
success
as
a
when
i
saw
however
that
he
was
wonderfully
popular
i
took
the
greatest
pains
to
engraft
upon
his
native
talent
all
the
instruction
he
was
capable
of
receiving
he
was
an
apt
pupil
and
i
provided
for
him
the
best
of
teachers
travel
and
attrition
with
so
many
people
in
so
many
lands
did
the
rest
the
general
left
america
three
years
before
a
diffident
uncultivated
little
boy
he
came
back
an
educated
accomplished
little
man
he
had
seen
much
and
had
profited
much
he
went
abroad
poor
and
he
came
home
rich
on
january
my
engagement
with
the
general
at
a
salary
ceased
and
we
made
a
new
arrangement
by
which
we
were
equal
partners
the
general
or
his
father
for
him
taking
of
the
profits
a
reservation
however
was
made
of
the
first
four
weeks
after
our
arrival
in
new
york
during
which
he
was
to
exhibit
at
my
museum
for
two
hundred
dollars
when
we
returned
to
america
the
general
s
father
had
acquired
a
handsome
fortune
and
settling
a
large
sum
upon
the
little
general
personally
he
placed
the
balance
at
interest
secured
by
bond
and
mortgage
excepting
thirty
thousand
dollars
with
which
he
purchased
land
near
the
city
limits
of
bridgeport
and
erected
a
large
and
substantial
mansion
where
he
resided
till
the
day
of
his
death
and
in
which
his
only
two
daughters
were
married
one
in
the
other
in
his
only
son
besides
the
general
was
born
in
all
the
family
except
little
charlie
are
of
the
usual
size
after
spending
a
month
in
visiting
his
friends
it
was
determined
that
the
general
and
his
parents
should
travel
through
the
united
states
i
agreed
to
accompany
them
with
occasional
intervals
of
rest
at
home
for
one
year
sharing
the
profits
equally
as
in
england
we
proceeded
to
washington
city
where
the
general
held
his
levees
in
april
visiting
president
polk
and
lady
at
the
white
house
thence
to
richmond
returning
to
baltimore
and
philadelphia
our
receipts
in
philadelphia
in
twelve
days
were
the
tour
for
the
entire
year
realized
about
the
same
average
the
expenses
were
from
dollars
to
thirty
dollars
per
day
from
philadelphia
we
went
to
boston
lowell
and
providence
our
receipts
on
one
day
in
the
latter
city
were
we
then
visited
new
bedford
fall
river
salem
worcester
springfield
albany
troy
niagara
falls
buffalo
and
intermediate
places
and
in
returning
to
new
york
we
stopped
at
the
principal
towns
on
the
hudson
river
after
this
we
visited
new
haven
hartford
portland
and
intermediate
towns
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
during
my
long
absence
abroad
i
had
become
almost
as
much
of
a
curiosity
to
my
patrons
as
i
was
to
the
spinster
from
maine
who
once
came
to
see
me
and
to
attend
the
services
in
my
lecture
room
if
i
showed
myself
about
the
museum
or
wherever
else
i
was
known
i
found
eyes
peering
and
fingers
pointing
at
me
and
could
frequently
overhear
the
remark
there
s
on
one
occasion
soon
after
my
return
i
was
sitting
in
the
reading
a
newspaper
a
man
came
and
purchased
a
ticket
of
admission
is
barnum
in
the
museum
he
asked
the
pointing
to
me
answered
this
is
supposing
the
gentleman
had
business
with
me
i
looked
up
from
the
paper
is
this
barnum
he
asked
it
is
i
replied
he
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
throwing
down
his
ticket
exclaimed
it
s
all
right
i
have
got
the
worth
of
my
money
and
away
he
went
without
going
into
the
museum
at
all
in
november
we
started
for
havana
taking
the
steamer
from
new
york
to
charleston
where
the
general
exhibited
as
well
as
at
columbia
augusta
savannah
milledgeville
macon
columbus
montgomery
mobile
and
new
orleans
at
this
latter
city
we
remained
three
weeks
including
christmas
and
new
year
s
we
arrived
in
havana
by
the
schooner
adams
gray
in
january
and
were
introduced
to
the
and
the
spanish
nobility
we
remained
a
month
in
havana
and
matanzas
the
general
proving
an
immense
favorite
in
havana
he
was
the
especial
pet
of
count
santovania
in
matanzas
we
were
very
much
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
a
princely
american
merchant
brinckerhoff
thrasher
the
american
patriot
and
gentleman
was
also
of
great
assistance
to
us
and
placed
me
under
deep
obligations
the
hotels
in
havana
are
not
good
an
american
who
is
accustomed
to
substantial
living
finds
it
difficult
to
get
enough
to
eat
we
stopped
at
the
washington
house
which
at
that
time
was
it
was
filthy
and
kept
by
a
woman
who
was
drunk
most
of
the
time
several
americans
boarded
there
who
were
regular
gormandizers
one
of
them
seeing
a
live
turkey
on
a
new
orleans
vessel
purchased
and
presented
it
to
the
landlady
it
was
a
small
one
and
when
it
was
carved
there
was
not
enough
of
it
to
go
an
american
a
large
and
a
tremendous
eater
who
resided
on
a
sugar
plantation
near
havana
happened
to
sit
near
the
carver
and
seeing
an
american
turkey
so
near
him
and
feeling
that
it
was
a
rare
dish
for
that
latitude
kept
helping
himself
so
that
when
the
carving
was
finished
he
had
eaten
about
one
half
of
the
turkey
unfortunately
the
man
who
bought
it
was
sitting
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
and
did
not
get
a
taste
of
the
coveted
bird
he
was
indignant
especially
against
the
innocent
gormandizer
from
the
sugar
plantation
who
of
course
was
not
acquainted
with
the
history
of
the
turkey
when
they
arose
from
the
table
the
planter
smacked
his
lips
and
patting
his
stomach
remarked
that
was
a
glorious
turkey
i
have
not
tasted
one
before
these
two
years
i
am
very
fond
of
them
and
when
i
go
back
to
my
plantation
i
mean
to
commence
raising
if
you
don
t
raise
one
before
you
leave
town
you
ll
be
a
dead
man
said
the
disappointed
poultry
purchaser
from
havana
we
went
to
new
orleans
where
we
remained
several
days
and
from
new
orleans
we
proceeded
to
louis
stopping
at
the
principal
towns
on
the
mississippi
river
and
returning
louisville
cincinnati
and
pittsburgh
we
reached
the
latter
city
early
in
may
from
this
point
it
was
agreed
between
stratton
and
myself
that
i
should
go
home
and
henceforth
travel
no
more
with
the
little
general
i
had
competent
agents
who
could
exhibit
him
without
my
personal
assistance
and
i
preferred
to
relinquish
a
portion
of
the
profits
rather
than
continue
to
be
a
travelling
showman
i
had
now
been
a
straggler
from
home
most
of
the
time
for
thirteen
years
and
i
can
not
describe
the
feelings
of
gratitude
with
which
i
reflected
that
having
by
the
most
arduous
toil
and
deprivations
succeeded
in
securing
a
satisfactory
competence
i
should
henceforth
spend
my
days
in
the
bosom
of
my
family
i
was
fully
determined
that
no
pecuniary
temptation
should
again
induce
me
to
forego
the
enjoyments
to
be
secured
only
in
the
circle
of
home
i
reached
my
residence
in
bridgeport
connecticut
in
the
latter
part
of
may
rejoiced
to
find
my
family
and
friends
in
good
health
and
delighted
to
find
myself
once
more
at
home
my
new
home
which
was
then
nearly
ready
for
occupancy
was
the
iranistan
more
than
two
years
had
been
employed
in
building
this
beautiful
residence
in
finding
that
fortune
was
continuing
to
favor
me
i
began
to
look
forward
eagerly
to
the
time
when
i
could
withdraw
from
the
whirlpool
of
business
excitement
and
settle
down
permanently
with
my
family
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
days
in
comparative
rest
i
wished
to
reside
within
a
few
hours
of
new
york
i
had
never
seen
more
delightful
locations
than
there
are
upon
the
borders
of
long
island
sound
between
new
rochelle
new
york
and
new
haven
connecticut
and
my
attention
was
therefore
turned
in
that
direction
bridgeport
seemed
to
be
about
the
proper
distance
from
the
great
metropolis
it
is
pleasantly
situated
at
the
terminus
of
two
railroads
which
traverse
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
naugatuck
and
housatonic
rivers
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
runs
through
the
city
and
there
is
also
daily
steamboat
communication
with
new
york
the
enterprise
which
characterized
the
city
seemed
to
mark
it
as
destined
to
become
the
first
in
the
state
in
size
and
opulence
and
i
was
not
long
in
deciding
with
the
concurrence
of
my
wife
to
fix
our
future
residence
in
that
vicinity
i
accordingly
purchased
seventeen
acres
of
land
less
than
a
mile
west
of
the
city
and
fronting
with
a
good
view
upon
the
sound
although
nominally
in
bridgeport
my
property
was
really
in
fairfield
a
few
rods
west
of
the
bridgeport
line
in
deciding
upon
the
kind
of
house
to
be
erected
i
determined
first
and
foremost
to
consult
convenience
and
comfort
i
cared
little
for
style
and
my
wife
cared
still
less
but
as
we
meant
to
have
a
good
house
it
might
as
well
at
the
same
time
be
unique
in
this
i
confess
i
had
an
eye
to
business
for
i
thought
that
a
pile
of
buildings
of
a
novel
order
might
indirectly
serve
as
an
advertisement
of
my
museum
in
visiting
brighton
in
england
i
had
been
greatly
pleased
with
the
pavilion
erected
by
george
iv
it
was
the
only
specimen
of
oriental
architecture
in
england
and
the
style
had
not
been
introduced
into
america
i
concluded
to
adopt
it
and
engaged
a
london
architect
to
furnish
me
a
set
of
drawings
after
the
general
plan
of
the
pavilion
differing
sufficiently
to
be
adapted
to
the
spot
of
ground
selected
for
my
homestead
on
my
second
return
visit
to
the
united
states
i
brought
these
drawings
with
me
and
engaged
a
competent
architect
and
builder
giving
him
instructions
to
proceed
with
the
work
not
by
the
job
but
by
the
day
and
to
spare
neither
time
nor
expense
in
erecting
a
comfortable
convenient
and
tasteful
residence
the
work
was
thus
begun
and
continued
while
i
was
still
abroad
and
during
the
time
when
i
was
making
my
tour
with
general
tom
thumb
through
the
united
states
and
cuba
new
and
magnificent
avenues
were
illustration
opened
in
the
vicinity
of
my
property
the
building
progressed
slowly
but
surely
and
substantially
elegant
and
appropriate
furniture
was
made
expressly
for
every
room
in
the
house
i
erected
expensive
water
works
to
supply
the
premises
the
stables
conservatories
and
were
perfect
in
their
kind
there
was
a
profusion
of
trees
set
out
on
the
grounds
the
whole
was
built
and
established
literally
regardless
of
expense
for
i
had
no
desire
even
to
ascertain
the
entire
cost
all
i
cared
to
know
was
that
it
suited
me
and
that
would
have
been
a
small
consideration
with
me
if
it
had
not
also
suited
my
family
the
whole
was
finally
completed
to
my
satisfaction
my
family
removed
into
the
premises
and
on
the
fourteenth
of
november
nearly
one
thousand
invited
guests
including
the
poor
and
the
rich
helped
us
in
the
custom
of
when
the
name
iranistan
was
announced
a
waggish
new
york
editor
syllabled
it
and
gave
as
the
interpretation
that
i
ran
a
long
time
before
i
could
stan
literally
however
the
name
signifies
eastern
country
place
or
more
poetically
oriental
the
plot
of
ground
upon
which
iranistan
was
erected
was
at
the
date
of
my
purchase
in
march
a
bare
field
but
i
transplanted
many
hundreds
of
fruit
and
forest
trees
some
of
the
latter
of
very
large
growth
when
they
were
moved
and
thus
in
a
few
years
my
premises
were
adorned
with
what
in
the
ordinary
process
of
growth
would
have
required
a
whole
generation
i
have
never
waited
for
my
trees
to
grow
if
money
would
transplant
them
of
nearly
full
growth
at
the
start
the
years
and
were
mainly
spent
with
my
family
though
i
went
every
week
to
new
york
to
look
after
the
interests
of
the
american
museum
while
i
was
in
europe
in
my
agent
fordyce
hitchcock
had
bought
out
for
me
the
baltimore
museum
a
establishment
in
full
operation
and
i
placed
it
under
the
charge
of
my
uncle
alanson
taylor
he
died
in
and
i
then
sold
the
baltimore
museum
to
the
orphean
family
by
whom
it
was
subsequently
transferred
to
john
owens
the
celebrated
comedian
after
my
return
from
europe
i
opened
in
a
museum
in
swain
s
fine
building
at
the
corner
of
chestnut
and
seventh
streets
in
philadelphia
this
was
in
all
respects
a
establishment
it
was
elegantly
fitted
up
and
contained
among
other
things
a
dozen
fine
large
paintings
such
as
the
deluge
cain
and
his
family
and
other
similar
subjects
which
i
had
ordered
copied
when
i
was
in
paris
from
paintings
in
the
gallery
of
the
louvre
there
was
also
a
complete
and
valuable
collection
of
curiosities
and
i
sent
from
new
york
from
time
to
time
my
transient
novelties
in
the
way
of
giants
dwarfs
fat
boys
animals
and
other
attractions
there
was
a
lecture
room
and
stage
for
dramatic
entertainments
but
i
was
catering
for
a
quaker
population
and
was
careful
to
introduce
or
permit
nothing
which
could
possibly
be
objectionable
while
the
museum
contained
such
as
the
temperate
family
the
intemperate
family
and
pelby
s
representation
of
the
last
supper
the
theatre
presented
the
drunkard
and
other
moral
dramas
the
most
respectable
people
in
the
city
patronized
the
museum
and
attended
the
theatre
the
drunkard
was
exceedingly
well
played
and
it
made
a
great
impression
there
was
a
temperance
pledge
in
the
which
was
signed
by
thousands
during
the
run
of
the
piece
almost
every
hour
during
the
day
and
evening
women
could
be
seen
bringing
their
husbands
to
the
museum
to
sign
the
pledge
i
stayed
in
philadelphia
long
enough
to
identify
myself
with
this
museum
and
to
successfully
start
the
enterprise
and
then
left
it
in
the
hands
of
different
managers
who
profitably
conducted
it
till
when
finding
that
it
occupied
too
much
of
my
time
and
attention
i
sold
it
to
clapp
spooner
for
at
the
end
of
that
year
the
building
and
contents
were
destroyed
by
fire
the
loss
was
a
serious
one
to
philadelphia
and
the
people
were
very
desirous
that
spooner
should
rebuild
the
establishment
but
a
highly
profitable
business
connection
with
the
adams
express
company
prevented
him
from
doing
so
while
my
philadelphia
museum
was
in
full
operation
peale
s
museum
ran
me
a
strong
opposition
at
the
masonic
hall
that
enterprise
proved
disastrous
and
i
purchased
the
collection
at
sheriff
s
sale
for
five
or
six
thousand
dollars
on
joint
account
of
my
friend
moses
kimball
and
myself
the
curiosities
were
equally
divided
going
to
his
boston
museum
and
the
other
half
to
my
american
museum
in
new
york
in
i
was
elected
president
of
the
fairfield
county
agricultural
society
in
connecticut
although
not
practically
a
farmer
i
had
purchased
about
one
hundred
acres
of
land
in
the
vicinity
of
my
residence
and
felt
and
still
feel
a
deep
interest
in
the
cause
of
agriculture
i
had
begun
by
importing
some
blood
stock
for
iranistan
and
as
i
was
at
one
time
attacked
by
the
hen
fever
i
erected
several
splendid
on
my
grounds
these
were
built
for
me
by
a
carpenter
who
wrote
an
application
for
a
situation
sending
me
a
frightfully
letter
in
which
he
said
that
he
was
youste
to
hard
work
i
thought
if
his
work
was
as
strong
as
his
spelling
he
was
the
man
i
wanted
and
i
employed
him
when
the
time
came
to
prepare
for
our
agricultural
fair
in
the
fall
he
made
a
series
of
gorgeous
cages
in
which
to
exhibit
my
shanghaes
bantams
and
other
fancy
fowls
i
went
out
to
see
them
before
they
were
sent
away
and
was
horrified
to
find
that
he
had
marked
the
cages
in
his
own
peculiar
style
describing
my
jersey
blues
for
instance
in
startling
capitals
as
gersy
i
called
for
a
to
remove
every
mark
on
the
cages
and
told
the
astonished
carpenter
that
he
might
do
anything
in
the
world
for
me
except
to
spell
in
it
was
determined
by
the
society
that
i
should
deliver
the
annual
address
i
begged
to
be
excused
on
the
ground
of
incompetency
but
my
excuses
were
of
no
avail
and
as
i
could
not
instruct
my
auditors
in
farming
i
gave
them
the
benefit
of
several
mistakes
which
i
had
committed
among
other
things
i
told
them
that
in
the
fall
of
my
head
gardener
reported
that
i
had
fifty
bushels
of
potatoes
to
spare
i
thereupon
directed
him
to
barrel
them
up
and
ship
them
to
new
york
for
sale
he
did
so
and
received
two
dollars
per
barrel
or
about
cents
per
bushel
but
unfortunately
after
the
potatoes
had
been
shipped
i
found
that
my
gardener
had
selected
all
the
largest
for
market
and
left
my
family
nothing
but
small
potatoes
to
live
on
during
the
winter
but
the
worst
is
still
to
come
my
potatoes
were
all
gone
before
march
and
i
was
obliged
to
buy
during
the
spring
over
fifty
bushels
of
potatoes
at
per
bushel
i
also
related
my
first
experiment
in
the
arboricultural
line
when
i
cut
from
two
thrifty
rows
of
young
any
quantity
of
what
i
supposed
to
be
suckers
or
sprouts
and
was
thereafter
informed
by
my
gardener
that
i
had
cut
off
all
his
grafts
a
friend
of
mine
james
johnson
lived
in
a
fine
house
a
quarter
of
a
mile
west
of
iranistan
and
as
i
owned
several
acres
of
land
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
directly
adjoining
his
homestead
i
surrounded
the
ground
with
high
pickets
and
introducing
a
number
of
rocky
mountain
elk
reindeer
and
american
deer
i
converted
it
into
a
deer
park
strangers
passing
by
would
naturally
suppose
that
it
belonged
to
johnson
s
estate
and
to
render
the
illusion
more
complete
his
wales
of
the
scientific
american
placed
a
sign
in
the
park
fronting
on
the
street
and
reading
all
persons
are
forbid
trespassing
on
these
grounds
or
disturbing
the
deer
i
acknowledged
the
corn
and
was
much
pleased
with
the
joke
johnson
was
delighted
and
bragged
considerably
of
having
got
ahead
of
barnum
and
the
sign
remained
undisturbed
for
several
days
it
happened
at
length
that
a
party
of
friends
came
to
visit
him
from
new
york
arriving
in
the
evening
johnson
told
them
he
had
got
a
capital
joke
on
barnum
he
would
not
explain
but
said
they
should
see
it
for
themselves
the
next
morning
bright
and
early
he
led
them
into
the
street
and
after
conducting
them
a
proper
distance
wheeled
them
around
in
front
of
the
sign
to
his
dismay
he
discovered
that
i
had
added
directly
under
his
name
the
words
to
his
friends
as
soon
as
they
understood
the
joke
enjoyed
it
mightily
but
it
was
said
that
neighbor
johnson
laughed
out
of
the
wrong
side
of
his
thereafter
johnson
was
known
among
his
friends
and
acquaintances
as
barnum
s
sometime
afterwards
when
i
was
president
of
the
pequonnock
bank
it
was
my
custom
every
year
to
give
a
grand
dinner
at
iranistan
to
the
directors
and
in
making
preparations
i
used
to
send
to
certain
friends
in
the
west
for
prairie
chickens
and
other
game
on
one
occasion
a
large
box
marked
p
barnum
bridgeport
game
was
lying
in
the
express
office
when
johnson
seeing
it
and
espying
the
word
game
said
look
here
i
am
barnum
s
and
i
ll
take
charge
of
this
and
take
charge
of
it
he
did
carrying
it
home
and
notifying
me
that
it
was
in
his
possession
and
that
as
he
was
my
he
would
keep
this
unless
i
sent
him
an
order
for
a
new
hat
he
knew
very
well
that
i
would
give
fifty
dollars
rather
than
be
deprived
of
the
box
and
as
he
also
threatened
to
give
a
game
dinner
at
his
own
house
i
speedily
sent
the
order
for
the
hat
acknowledged
the
good
joke
and
my
own
guests
enjoyed
the
double
during
the
year
frank
leslie
since
so
widely
known
as
the
publisher
of
several
illustrated
journals
came
to
me
with
letters
of
introduction
from
london
and
i
employed
him
to
get
up
for
me
an
illustrated
catalogue
of
my
museum
this
he
did
in
a
splendid
manner
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
copies
were
sold
and
distributed
far
and
near
thus
adding
greatly
to
the
renown
of
the
establishment
i
count
these
two
years
and
among
the
happiest
of
my
life
i
had
enough
to
do
in
the
management
of
my
business
and
yet
i
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
leisure
hours
to
pass

a

a
friend
in
need
many
of
my
most
fortunate
enterprises
have
fairly
startled
me
by
the
magnitude
of
their
success
when
my
sanguine
hopes
predicted
a
steady
flow
of
fortune
i
have
been
inundated
when
i
calculated
upon
making
a
curious
public
pay
me
liberally
for
a
meritorious
article
i
have
often
found
the
same
public
eager
to
deluge
me
with
compensation
yet
i
never
believed
in
mere
luck
and
i
always
pitied
the
simpleton
who
relies
on
luck
for
his
success
luck
is
in
no
sense
the
foundation
of
my
fortune
from
the
beginning
of
my
career
i
planned
and
worked
for
my
success
to
be
sure
my
schemes
often
amazed
me
with
the
affluence
of
their
results
and
arriving
at
the
very
best
i
sometimes
builded
better
than
i
for
a
long
time
i
had
been
incubating
a
plan
for
an
extraordinary
exhibition
which
i
was
sure
would
be
a
success
and
would
excite
universal
attention
and
commendation
in
america
and
abroad
this
was
nothing
less
than
a
congress
of
nations
an
assemblage
of
representatives
of
all
the
nations
that
could
be
reached
by
land
or
sea
i
meant
to
secure
a
man
and
woman
as
perfect
as
could
be
procured
from
every
accessible
people
civilized
and
barbarous
on
the
face
of
the
globe
i
had
actually
contracted
with
an
agent
to
go
to
europe
to
make
arrangements
to
secure
specimens
for
such
a
show
even
now
i
can
conceive
of
no
exhibition
which
would
be
more
interesting
and
which
would
appeal
more
generally
to
all
classes
of
patrons
as
it
was
and
while
positively
preparing
for
such
a
congress
it
occurred
to
me
that
another
great
enterprise
could
be
undertaken
at
less
risk
with
far
less
real
trouble
and
with
more
remunerative
results
and
now
i
come
to
speak
of
an
undertaking
which
my
worst
enemy
will
admit
was
bold
in
its
conception
complete
in
its
development
and
astounding
in
its
success
it
was
an
enterprise
never
before
or
since
equalled
in
managerial
annals
as
i
recall
it
now
i
almost
tremble
at
the
seeming
temerity
of
the
attempt
that
i
am
proud
of
it
i
freely
confess
it
placed
me
before
the
world
in
a
new
light
it
gained
me
many
warm
friends
in
new
circles
it
was
in
itself
a
fortune
to
me
i
risked
much
but
i
made
more
it
was
in
october
that
i
conceived
the
idea
of
bringing
jenny
lind
to
this
country
i
had
never
heard
her
sing
inasmuch
as
she
arrived
in
london
a
few
weeks
after
i
left
that
city
with
general
tom
thumb
her
reputation
however
was
sufficient
for
me
i
usually
jump
at
conclusions
and
almost
invariably
find
that
my
first
impressions
are
correct
it
struck
me
when
i
first
thought
of
this
speculation
that
if
properly
managed
it
must
prove
immensely
profitable
provided
i
could
engage
the
swedish
nightingale
on
any
terms
within
the
range
of
reason
as
it
was
a
great
undertaking
i
considered
the
matter
seriously
for
several
days
and
all
my
cipherings
and
calculations
gave
but
one
result
immense
success
reflecting
that
very
much
would
depend
upon
the
manner
in
which
she
should
be
brought
before
the
public
i
saw
that
my
task
would
be
an
exceedingly
arduous
one
it
was
possible
i
knew
that
circumstances
might
occur
which
would
make
the
enterprise
disastrous
the
public
is
a
very
strange
animal
and
although
a
good
knowledge
of
human
nature
will
generally
lead
a
caterer
of
amusements
to
hit
the
people
they
are
fickle
and
ofttimes
perverse
a
slight
misstep
in
the
management
of
a
public
entertainment
frequently
wrecks
the
most
promising
enterprise
but
i
had
marked
the
divine
jenny
as
a
sure
card
and
to
secure
the
prize
i
began
to
cast
about
for
a
competent
agent
i
found
in
john
hall
wilton
an
englishman
who
had
visited
this
country
with
the
players
the
best
man
whom
i
knew
for
that
purpose
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
make
the
arrangement
with
him
by
which
i
was
to
pay
but
little
more
than
his
expenses
if
he
failed
in
his
mission
but
by
which
also
he
was
to
be
paid
a
large
sum
if
he
succeeded
in
bringing
jenny
lind
to
our
shores
on
any
terms
within
a
liberal
schedule
which
i
set
forth
to
him
in
writing
on
the
of
november
i
furnished
wilton
with
the
necessary
documents
including
a
letter
of
general
instructions
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
exhibit
to
jenny
lind
and
to
any
other
musical
notables
whom
he
thought
proper
and
a
private
letter
containing
hints
and
suggestions
not
embodied
in
the
former
i
also
gave
him
letters
of
introduction
to
my
bankers
baring
brothers
of
london
as
well
as
to
many
friends
in
england
and
france
the
sum
of
all
my
instructions
public
and
private
to
wilton
amounted
to
this
he
was
to
engage
her
on
shares
if
possible
i
however
authorized
him
to
engage
her
at
any
rate
not
exceeding
one
thousand
dollars
a
night
for
any
number
of
nights
up
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
with
all
her
expenses
including
servants
carriages
secretary
besides
also
engaging
such
musical
assistants
not
exceeding
three
in
number
as
she
should
select
let
the
terms
be
what
they
might
if
necessary
i
should
place
the
entire
amount
of
money
named
in
the
engagement
in
the
hands
of
london
bankers
before
she
sailed
wilton
s
compensation
was
arranged
on
a
kind
of
sliding
scale
to
be
governed
by
the
terms
which
he
made
for
me
so
that
the
farther
he
kept
below
my
utmost
limits
the
better
he
should
be
paid
for
making
the
engagements
he
proceeded
to
london
and
opened
a
correspondence
with
miss
lind
who
was
then
on
the
continent
he
learned
from
the
tenor
of
her
letters
that
if
she
could
be
induced
to
visit
america
at
all
she
must
be
accompanied
by
julius
benedict
the
accomplished
composer
pianist
and
musical
director
and
also
she
was
impressed
with
the
belief
that
signor
belletti
the
fine
baritone
would
be
of
essential
service
wilton
therefore
at
once
called
upon
benedict
and
also
signor
belletti
who
were
both
then
in
london
and
in
numerous
interviews
was
enabled
to
learn
the
terms
on
which
they
would
consent
to
engage
to
visit
this
country
with
miss
lind
having
obtained
the
information
desired
he
proceeded
to
lubeck
in
germany
to
seek
an
interview
with
miss
lind
herself
upon
arriving
at
her
hotel
he
sent
his
card
requesting
her
to
specify
an
hour
for
an
interview
she
named
the
following
morning
and
he
was
punctual
to
the
appointment
in
the
course
of
the
first
conversation
she
frankly
told
him
that
during
the
time
occupied
by
their
correspondence
she
had
written
to
friends
in
london
including
my
friend
joshua
bates
of
the
house
of
baring
brothers
and
had
informed
herself
respecting
my
character
capacity
and
responsibility
which
she
assured
him
were
quite
satisfactory
she
informed
him
however
that
at
that
time
there
were
four
persons
anxious
to
negotiate
with
her
for
an
american
tour
one
of
these
gentlemen
was
a
opera
manager
in
london
another
a
theatrical
manager
in
manchester
a
third
a
musical
composer
and
conductor
of
the
orchestra
of
her
majesty
s
opera
in
london
and
the
fourth
chevalier
wyckoff
a
person
who
had
conducted
a
successful
speculation
some
years
previously
by
visiting
america
in
charge
of
the
celebrated
danseuse
fanny
ellsler
several
of
these
parties
had
called
upon
her
personally
and
wyckoff
upon
hearing
my
name
attempted
to
deter
her
from
making
any
engagement
with
me
by
assuring
her
that
i
was
a
mere
showman
and
that
for
the
sake
of
making
money
by
the
speculation
i
would
not
scruple
to
put
her
into
a
box
and
exhibit
her
through
the
country
at
cents
a
head
this
she
confessed
somewhat
alarmed
her
and
she
wrote
to
bates
on
the
subject
he
entirely
disabused
her
mind
by
assuring
her
that
he
knew
me
personally
and
that
in
treating
with
me
she
was
not
dealing
with
an
adventurer
who
might
make
her
remuneration
depend
entirely
upon
the
success
of
the
enterprise
but
i
was
able
to
carry
out
all
my
engagements
let
them
prove
never
so
unprofitable
and
she
could
place
the
fullest
reliance
upon
my
honor
and
integrity
now
said
she
to
wilton
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
on
that
point
for
i
know
the
world
pretty
well
and
am
aware
how
far
jealousy
and
envy
will
sometimes
carry
persons
and
as
those
who
are
trying
to
treat
with
me
are
all
anxious
that
i
should
participate
in
the
profits
or
losses
of
the
enterprise
i
much
prefer
treating
with
you
since
your
principal
is
willing
to
assume
all
the
responsibility
and
take
the
entire
management
and
chances
of
the
result
upon
several
interviews
ensued
during
which
she
learned
from
wilton
that
he
had
settled
with
benedict
and
belletti
in
regard
to
the
amount
of
their
salaries
provided
the
engagement
was
concluded
and
in
the
course
of
a
week
wilton
and
miss
lind
had
arranged
the
terms
and
conditions
on
which
she
was
ready
to
conclude
the
negotiations
as
these
terms
were
within
the
limits
fixed
in
my
private
letter
of
instructions
the
following
agreement
was
duly
drawn
in
triplicate
and
signed
by
herself
and
wilton
at
lubeck
january
and
the
signatures
of
benedict
and
belletti
were
affixed
in
london

few
days
afterwards

phineas
barnum
i
certify
the
above
to
be
a
true
extract
from
the
letter
wilton
i
was
at
my
museum
in
philadelphia
when
wilton
arrived
in
new
york
february
he
immediately
telegraphed
to
me
in
the
cipher
we
had
agreed
upon
that
he
had
signed
an
engagement
with
jenny
lind
by
which
she
was
to
commence
her
concerts
in
america
in
the
following
september
i
was
somewhat
startled
by
this
sudden
announcement
and
feeling
that
the
time
to
elapse
before
her
arrival
was
so
long
that
it
would
be
policy
to
keep
the
engagement
private
for
a
few
months
i
immediately
telegraphed
him
not
to
mention
it
to
any
person
and
that
i
would
meet
him
the
next
day
in
new
york
when
we
reflect
how
thoroughly
jenny
lind
her
musical
powers
her
character
and
wonderful
successes
were
subsequently
known
by
all
classes
in
this
country
as
well
as
throughout
the
civilized
world
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
at
the
time
this
engagement
was
made
she
was
comparatively
unknown
on
this
side
the
water
we
can
hardly
credit
the
fact
that
millions
of
persons
in
america
had
never
heard
of
her
that
other
millions
had
merely
read
her
name
but
had
no
distinct
idea
of
who
or
what
she
was
only
a
small
portion
of
the
public
were
really
aware
of
her
great
musical
triumphs
in
the
old
world
and
this
portion
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
musical
people
travellers
who
had
visited
the
old
world
and
the
conductors
of
the
press
the
next
morning
i
started
for
new
york
on
arriving
at
princeton
we
met
the
new
york
cars
and
purchasing
the
morning
papers
i
was
surprised
to
find
in
them
a
full
account
of
my
engagement
with
jenny
lind
however
this
premature
announcement
could
not
be
recalled
and
i
put
the
best
face
on
the
matter
anxious
to
learn
how
this
communication
would
strike
the
public
mind
i
informed
the
conductor
whom
i
well
knew
that
i
had
made
an
engagement
with
jenny
lind
and
that
she
would
surely
visit
this
country
in
the
following
august
jenny
lind
is
she
a
dancer
asked
the
conductor
i
informed
him
who
and
what
she
was
but
his
question
had
chilled
me
as
if
his
words
were
ice
really
thought
i
if
this
is
all
that
a
man
in
the
capacity
of
a
railroad
conductor
between
philadelphia
and
new
york
knows
of
the
greatest
songstress
in
the
world
i
am
not
sure
that
six
months
will
be
too
long
a
time
for
me
to
occupy
in
enlightening
the
public
in
regard
to
her
merits
i
had
an
interview
with
wilton
and
learned
from
him
that
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
it
would
be
requisite
for
me
to
place
the
entire
amount
stipulated
in
the
hands
of
the
london
bankers
i
at
once
resolved
to
ratify
the
agreement
and
immediately
sent
the
necessary
documents
to
miss
lind
and
benedict
and
belletti
i
then
began
to
prepare
the
public
mind
through
the
newspapers
for
the
reception
of
the
great
songstress
how
effectually
this
was
done
is
still
within
the
remembrance
of
the
american
public
as
a
sample
of
the
manner
in
which
i
accomplished
my
purpose
i
present
the
following
extract
from
my
first
letter
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
papers
of
february
perhaps
i
may
not
make
any
money
by
this
enterprise
but
i
assure
you
that
if
i
knew
i
should
not
make
a
farthing
profit
i
would
ratify
the
engagement
so
anxious
am
i
that
the
united
states
should
be
visited
by
a
lady
whose
vocal
powers
have
never
been
approached
by
any
other
human
being
and
whose
character
is
charity
simplicity
and
goodness
personified
miss
lind
has
great
anxiety
to
visit
america
she
speaks
of
this
country
and
its
institutions
in
the
highest
terms
of
praise
in
her
engagement
with
me
which
includes
havana
she
expressly
reserves
the
right
to
give
charitable
concerts
whenever
she
thinks
proper
since
her
in
england
she
has
given
to
the
poor
from
her
own
private
purse
more
than
the
whole
amount
which
i
have
engaged
to
pay
her
and
the
proceeds
of
concerts
for
charitable
purposes
in
great
britain
where
she
has
sung
gratuitously
have
realized
more
than
ten
times
that
the
people
soon
began
to
talk
about
jenny
lind
and
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
obtain
a
good
portrait
of
her
fortunately
a
fine
opportunity
occurred
one
day
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
office
of
the
museum
a
foreigner
approached
me
with
a
small
package
under
his
arm
he
informed
me
in
broken
english
that
he
was
a
swede
and
said
he
was
an
artist
who
had
just
arrived
from
stockholm
where
jenny
lind
had
kindly
given
him
a
number
of
sittings
and
he
now
had
with
him
the
portrait
of
her
which
he
had
painted
upon
copper
he
unwrapped
the
package
and
showed
me
a
beautiful
picture
of
the
swedish
nightingale
inclosed
in
an
elegant
gilt
frame
about
fourteen
by
twenty
inches
it
was
just
the
thing
i
wanted
the
price
was
fifty
dollars
and
i
purchased
it
at
once
upon
showing
it
to
an
artist
friend
the
same
day
he
quietly
assured
me
that
it
was
a
cheap
lithograph
pasted
on
a
tin
back
neatly
varnished
and
made
to
appear
like
a
fine
oil
painting
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
picture
did
not
exceed
and
one
half
cents
after
getting
together
all
my
available
funds
for
the
purpose
of
transmitting
them
to
london
in
the
shape
of
united
states
bonds
i
found
a
considerable
sum
still
lacking
to
make
up
the
amount
i
had
some
second
mortgages
which
were
perfectly
good
but
i
could
not
negotiate
them
in
wall
street
nothing
would
answer
there
short
of
first
mortgages
on
new
york
or
brooklyn
city
property
i
went
to
the
president
of
the
bank
where
i
had
done
all
my
business
for
eight
years
i
offered
him
as
security
for
a
loan
my
second
mortgages
and
as
an
additional
inducement
i
proposed
to
make
over
to
him
my
contract
with
jenny
lind
with
a
written
guaranty
that
he
should
appoint
a
receiver
who
at
my
expense
should
take
charge
of
all
the
receipts
over
and
above
three
thousand
dollars
per
night
and
appropriate
them
towards
the
payment
of
my
loan
he
laughed
in
my
face
and
said
mr
barnum
it
is
generally
believed
in
wall
street
that
your
engagement
with
jenny
lind
will
ruin
you
i
do
not
think
you
will
ever
receive
so
much
as
three
thousand
dollars
at
a
single
i
was
indignant
at
his
want
of
appreciation
and
answered
him
that
i
would
not
at
that
moment
take
for
my
contract
nor
would
i
found
upon
further
inquiry
that
it
was
useless
in
wall
street
to
offer
the
nightingale
in
exchange
for
goldfinches
i
finally
was
introduced
to
john
aspinwall
of
the
firm
of
howland
aspinwall
and
he
gave
me
a
letter
of
credit
from
his
firm
on
baring
brothers
for
a
large
sum
on
collateral
securities
which
a
spirit
of
genuine
respect
for
my
enterprise
induced
him
to
accept
after
disposing
of
several
pieces
of
property
for
cash
i
footed
up
the
various
amounts
and
still
discovered
myself
five
thousand
dollars
short
i
felt
that
it
was
indeed
the
last
feather
that
breaks
the
camel
s
happening
casually
to
state
my
desperate
case
to
the
rev
abel
thomas
of
philadelphia
for
many
years
a
friend
of
mine
he
promptly
placed
the
requisite
amount
at
my
disposal
i
gladly
accepted
his
proffered
friendship
and
felt
that
he
had
removed

my
shoulders

she
declined
several
liberal
offers
to
sing
in
london
but
at
my
solicitation
gave
two
concerts
in
liverpool
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
for
america
my
object
in
making
this
request
was
to
add
the
of
that
side
to
the
excitement
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
which
was
already
nearly
up
to
fever
heat
the
first
of
the
two
liverpool
concerts
was
given
the
night
previous
to
the
departure
of
the
saturday
steamer
for
america
my
agent
had
procured
the
services
of
a
musical
critic
from
london
who
finished
his
account
of
this
concert
at
half
past
one
o
clock
the
following
morning
and
at
two
o
clock
my
agent
was
overseeing
its
insertion
in
a
liverpool
morning
paper
numbers
of
which
he
forwarded
to
me
by
the
steamer
of
the
same
day
the
republication
of
the
criticism
in
the
american
papers
including
an
account
of
the
enthusiasm
which
attended
and
followed
this
concert
her
had
the
desired
effect
on
wednesday
morning
august
jenny
lind
and
benedict
and
belletti
set
sail
from
liverpool
in
the
steamship
atlantic
in
which
i
had
long
before
engaged
the
necessary
accommodations
and
on
board
of
which
i
had
shipped
a
piano
for
their
use
they
were
accompanied
by
my
agent
wilton
and
also
by
miss
ahmansen
and
max
hjortzberg
cousins
of
miss
lind
the
latter
being
her
secretary
also
by
her
two
servants
and
the
valet
of
benedict
and
belletti
it
was
expected
that
the
steamer
would
arrive
on
sunday
september
but
determined
to
meet
the
songstress
on
her
arrival
whenever
it
might
be
i
went
to
staten
island
on
saturday
and
slept
at
the
hospitable
residence
of
my
friend
sidney
doane
who
was
at
that
time
the
health
officer
of
the
port
of
new
york
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
o
clock
on
sunday
morning
the
atlantic
hove
in
sight
and
immediately
afterwards
through
the
kindness
of
my
friend
doane
i
was
on
board
the
ship
and
had
taken
jenny
lind
by
the
hand
after
a
few
moments
conversation
she
asked
me
when
and
where
i
had
heard
her
sing
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
in
my
life
i
replied
how
is
it
possible
that
you
dared
risk
so
much
money
on
a
person
whom
you
never
heard
sing
she
asked
in
surprise
i
risked
it
on
your
reputation
which
in
musical
matters
i
would
much
rather
trust
than
my
own
judgment
i
replied
i
may
as
well
state
that
although
i
relied
prominently
upon
jenny
lind
s
reputation
as
a
great
musical
i
also
took
largely
into
my
estimate
of
her
success
with
all
classes
of
the
american
public
her
character
for
extraordinary
benevolence
and
generosity
without
this
peculiarity
in
her
disposition
i
never
would
have
dared
make
the
engagement
which
i
did
as
i
felt
sure
that
there
were
multitudes
of
individuals
in
america
who
would
be
prompted
to
attend
her
concerts
by
this
feeling
alone
thousands
of
persons
covered
the
shipping
and
piers
and
other
thousands
had
congregated
on
the
wharf
at
canal
street
to
see
her
the
wildest
enthusiasm
prevailed
as
the
steamer
approached
the
dock
so
great
was
the
rush
on
a
sloop
near
the
steamer
s
berth
that
one
man
in
his
zeal
to
obtain
a
good
view
accidentally
tumbled
overboard
amid
the
shouts
of
those
near
him
miss
lind
witnessed
this
incident
and
was
much
alarmed
he
was
however
soon
rescued
after
taking
to
himself
a
cold
duck
instead
of
securing
a
view
of
the
nightingale
a
bower
of
green
trees
decorated
with
beautiful
flags
was
discovered
on
the
wharf
together
with
two
triumphal
arches
on
one
of
which
was
inscribed
welcome
jenny
lind
the
second
was
surmounted
by
the
american
eagle
and
bore
the
inscription
welcome
to
america
these
decorations
were
not
produced
by
magic
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
reasonably
find
fault
with
those
who
suspected
i
had
a
hand
in
their
erection
my
private
carriage
was
in
waiting
and
jenny
lind
was
escorted
to
it
by
captain
west
the
rest
of
the
musical
party
entered
the
carriage
and
mounting
the
box
at
the
driver
s
side
i
directed
him
to
the
irving
house
i
took
that
seat
as
a
legitimate
advertisement
and
my
presence
on
the
outside
of
the
carriage
aided
those
who
filled
the
windows
and
illustration
sidewalks
along
the
whole
route
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
jenny
lind
had
arrived
a
reference
to
the
journals
of
that
day
will
show
that
never
before
had
there
been
such
enthusiasm
in
the
city
of
new
york
or
indeed
in
america
within
ten
minutes
after
our
arrival
at
the
irving
house
not
less
than
twenty
thousand
persons
had
congregated
around
the
entrance
in
broadway
nor
was
the
number
diminished
before
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
at
her
request
i
dined
with
her
that
afternoon
and
when
according
to
european
custom
she
prepared
to
pledge
me
in
a
glass
of
wine
she
was
somewhat
surprised
at
my
saying
miss
lind
i
do
not
think
you
can
ask
any
other
favor
on
earth
which
i
would
not
gladly
grant
but
i
am
a
teetotaler
and
must
beg
to
be
permitted
to
drink
your
health
and
happiness
in
a
glass
of
cold
at
twelve
o
clock
that
night
she
was
serenaded
by
the
new
york
musical
fund
society
numbering
on
that
occasion
two
hundred
musicians
they
were
escorted
to
the
irving
house
by
about
three
hundred
firemen
in
their
red
shirts
bearing
torches
there
was
a
far
greater
throng
in
the
streets
than
there
was
even
during
the
day
the
calls
for
jenny
lind
were
so
vehement
that
i
led
her
through
a
window
to
the
balcony
the
loud
cheers
from
the
crowds
lasted
for
several
minutes
before
the
serenade
was
permitted
to
proceed
again
i
have
given
the
merest
sketch
of
but
a
portion
of
the
incidents
of
jenny
lind
s
first
day
in
america
for
weeks
afterwards
the
excitement
was
unabated
her
rooms
were
thronged
by
visitors
including
the
magnates
of
the
land
in
both
church
and
state
the
carriages
of
the
wealthiest
citizens
could
be
seen
in
front
of
her
hotel
at
nearly
all
hours
of
the
day
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
i
prevented
the
fashionables
from
monopolizing
her
altogether
and
thus
as
i
believed
sadly
marring
my
interests
by
cutting
her
off
from
the
warm
sympathies
she
had
awakened
among
the
masses
presents
of
all
sorts
were
showered
upon
her
milliners
and
shopkeepers
vied
with
each
other
in
calling
her
attention
to
their
wares
of
which
they
sent
her
many
valuable
specimens
delighted
if
in
return
they
could
receive
her
autograph
acknowledgment
songs
quadrilles
and
polkas
were
dedicated
to
her
and
poets
sung
in
her
praise
we
had
jenny
lind
gloves
jenny
lind
bonnets
jenny
lind
riding
hats
jenny
lind
shawls
mantillas
robes
chairs
sofas
pianos
in
fact
every
thing
was
jenny
lind
her
movements
were
constantly
watched
and
the
moment
her
carriage
appeared
at
the
door
it
was
surrounded
by
multitudes
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
swedish
nightingale
in
looking
over
my
of
extracts
from
the
new
york
papers
of
that
day
in
which
all
accessible
details
concerning
her
were
duly
chronicled
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
such
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
should
have
existed
an
abstract
of
the
sayings
and
doings
in
regard
to
the
jenny
lind
mania
for
the
first
ten
days
after
her
arrival
appeared
in
the
london
of
and
although
it
was
an
ironical
showing
up
of
the
american
enthusiasm
filling
several
columns
it
was
nevertheless
a
faithful
condensation
of
facts
which
at
this
late
day
seem
even
to
myself
more
like
a
dream
than
reality
before
her
arrival
i
had
offered
for
a
prize
ode
greeting
to
america
to
be
sung
by
jenny
lind
at
her
first
concert
several
hundred
poems
were
sent
in
from
all
parts
of
the
united
states
and
the
canadas
the
duties
of
the
prize
committee
in
reading
these
effusions
and
making
choice
of
the
one
most
worthy
the
prize
were
truly
arduous
the
offerings
with
perhaps
a
dozen
exceptions
were
the
merest
doggerel
trash
the
prize
was
awarded
to
bayard
taylor
for
the
following
ode
greeting
to
america
words
by
bayard
taylor
music
by
julius
benedict
i
greet
with
a
full
heart
the
land
of
the
west
whose
banner
of
stars
o
er
a
world
is
unrolled
whose
empire
o
ershadows
atlantic
s
wide
breast
and
opens
to
sunset
its
gateway
of
gold
the
land
of
the
mountain
the
land
of
the
lake
and
rivers
that
roll
in
magnificent
tide
where
the
souls
of
the
mighty
from
slumber
awake
and
hallow
the
soil
for
whose
freedom
they
died
thou
cradle
of
empire
though
wide
be
the
foam
that
severs
the
land
of
my
fathers
and
thee
i
hear
from
thy
bosom
the
welcome
of
home
for
song
has
a
home
in
the
hearts
of
the
free
and
long
as
thy
waters
shall
gleam
in
the
sun
and
long
as
thy
heroes
remember
their
scars
be
the
hands
of
thy
children
united
as
one
and
peace
shed
her
light
on
thy
banner
of
stars
this
award
although
it
gave
general
satisfaction
yet
was
met
with
disfavor
by
several
disappointed
poets
who
notwithstanding
the
decision
of
the
committee
persisted
in
believing
and
declaring
their
own
productions
to
be
the
best
this
state
of
feeling
was
doubtless
in
part
the
cause
which
led
to
the
publication
about
this
time
of
a
witty
pamphlet
entitled
barnum
s
parnassus
being
confidential
disclosures
of
the
prize
committee
on
the
jenny
lind
it
gave
some
capital
hits
in
which
the
committee
the
enthusiastic
public
the
nightingale
and
myself
were
roundly
ridiculed
the
following
is
a
fair
specimen
from
the
work
in
question
barnumopsis
a
recitative
when
to
the
common
rest
that
crowns
his
days
dusty
and
worn
the
tired
pedestrian
goes
what
light
is
that
whose
wide
o
erlooking
blaze
a
sudden
glory
on
his
pathway
throws
tis
not
the
setting
sun
whose
drooping
lid
closed
on
the
weary
world
at
six
tis
not
the
rising
moon
whose
rays
are
hid
behind
the
city
s
sombre
piles
of
bricks
it
is
the
drummond
light
that
from
the
top
of
barnum
s
massive
pile
there
darts
its
quick
gleam
o
er
every
shadowed
shop
and
gilds
broadway
with
unaccustomed
glare
there
o
er
the
sordid
gloom
whose
deep

the

type
of

in
its
pride
his

stands
him
who
in

of
wonders
new
and
strange
grasps
the
wide
skirts
of
nature

mystic
robe
explores
the
circles
of
eternal

the
dark
chambers
of

for

gladly
i
heard
the
summons
come
to
join
myself
the
innumerable
caravan
besides
the
foregoing
this
pamphlet
contained
eleven
poems
most
of
which
abounded
in
wit
i
have
room
for
but
a
single
stanza
the
poet
speaks
of
the
various
curiosities
in
the
museum
and
representing
me
as
still
searching
for
further
novelties
makes
me
address
the
swedish
nightingale
as
follows
so
jenny
come
along
you
re
just
the
card
for
me
and
quit
these
kings
and
queens
for
the
country
of
the
free
they
ll
welcome
you
with
speeches
and
serenades
and
rockets
and
you
will
touch
their
hearts
and
i
will
tap
their
pockets

if
between
us
both

various
extracts
from
this
brochure
were
copied
in
the
papers
daily
and
my
agents
scattered
the
work
as
widely
as
possible
thus
efficiently
aiding
and
advertising
my
enterprise
and
serving
to
keep
up
the
public
excitement
among
the
many
complimentary
poems
sent
in
was
the
following
by
sigourney
which
that
distinguished
writer
enclosed
in
a
letter
to
me
with
the
request
that
i
should
hand
it
to
miss
lind
the
swedish
songstress
and
her
charities
by
sigourney
blest
must
their
vocation
be
who
with
tones
of
melody
charm
the
discord
and
the
strife
and
the
railroad
rush
of
life
and
with
orphean
magic
move
souls
inert
to
life
and
love

there

one

jenny
lind
s
first
concert
was
fixed
to
come
off
at
castle
garden
on
wednesday
evening
september
and
most
of
the
tickets
were
sold
at
auction
on
the
saturday
and
monday
previous
to
the
concert
john
genin
the
hatter
laid
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
by
purchasing
the
first
ticket
at
it
has
been
extensively
reported
that
genin
and
i
are
but
our
only
relations
are
those
of
business
and
friendship
the
proprietors
of
the
garden
saw
fit
to
make
the
usual
charge
of
one
shilling
to
all
persons
who
entered
the
premises
yet
three
thousand
people
were
present
at
the
auction
one
thousand
tickets
were
sold
on
the
first
day
for
an
aggregate
sum
of
on
the
tuesday
after
her
arrival
i
informed
miss
lind
that
i
wished
to
make
a
slight
alteration
in
our
agreement
what
is
it
she
asked
in
surprise
i
am
convinced
i
replied
that
our
enterprise
will
be
much
more
successful
than
either
of
us
anticipated
i
wish
therefore
to
stipulate
that
you
shall
receive
not
only
for
each
concert
besides
all
the
expenses
as
heretofore
agreed
on
but
after
taking
per
night
for
expenses
and
my
services
the
balance
shall
be
equally
divided
between
jenny
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
she
could
not
comprehend
my
proposition
after
i
had
repeated
it
and
she
fully
understood
its
import
she
cordially
grasped
me
by
the
hand
and
exclaimed
mr
barnum
you
are
a
gentleman
of
honor
you
are
generous
it
is
just
as
bates
told
me
i
will
sing
for
you
as
long
as
you
please
i
will
sing
for
you
in
america
in
europe
anywhere
upon
drawing
the
new
contract
which
was
to
include
this
entirely
voluntary
and
liberal
advance
on
my
part
beyond
the
terms
of
the
original
agreement
miss
lind
s
lawyer
john
jay
who
was
present
solely
to
put
in
writing
the
new
arrangement
between
miss
lind
and
myself
insisted
upon
intruding
the
suggestion
that
she
should
have
the
right
to
terminate
the
engagement
at
the
end
of
the
sixtieth
concert
if
she
should
choose
to
do
so
this
proposition
was
so
persistently
and
annoyingly
pressed
that
miss
lind
was
finally
induced
to
entertain
it
at
the
same
time
offering
if
she
did
so
to
refund
to
me
all
moneys
paid
her
up
to
that
time
excepting
the
per
concert
according
to
the
original
agreement
this
was
agreed
to
and
it
was
also
arranged
that
she
might
terminate
the
engagement
at
the
concert
if
she
desired
upon
paying
me
for
the
loss
of
the
additional
fifty
nights
after
this
new
arrangement
was
completed
i
said
now
miss
lind
as
you
are
directly
interested
you
must
have
an
agent
to
assist
in
taking
and
counting
the
tickets
to
which
she
replied
oh
no
barnum
i
have
every
confidence
in
you
and
i
must
decline
to
act
upon
your
suggestion
but
i
continued
i
never
allow
myself
if
it
can
be
avoided
when
i
have
associates
in
the
same
interests
to
be
placed
in
a
position
where
i
must
assume
the
sole
responsibility
i
never
even
permitted
an
actor
to
take
a
benefit
at
my
museum
unless
he
placed
a
of
his
own
at
the
thus
urged
miss
lind
engaged
seton
to
act
as
her
and
after
we
had
satisfactorily
arranged
the
matter
jay
knowing
the
whole
affair
had
the
impudence
to
come
to
me
with
a
package
of
blank
printed
affidavits
which
he
demanded
that
i
should
fill
out
from
day
to
day
with
the
receipts
of
each
concert
and
swear
to
their
correctness
before
a
magistrate
i
told
him
that
i
would
see
him
on
the
subject
at
miss
lind
s
hotel
that
afternoon
and
going
there
a
few
moments
before
the
appointed
hour
i
narrated
the
circumstances
to
benedict
and
showed
him
an
affidavit
which
i
had
made
that
morning
to
the
effect
that
i
would
never
directly
or
indirectly
take
any
advantage
whatever
of
miss
lind
this
i
had
made
oath
to
for
i
thought
if
there
was
any
swearing
of
that
kind
to
be
done
i
would
do
it
in
a
lump
rather
than
in
detail
benedict
was
very
much
opposed
to
it
and
arriving
during
the
interview
jay
was
made
to
see
the
matter
in
such
a
light
that
he
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
his
proposition
and
requesting
that
the
affair
might
not
be
mentioned
to
miss
lind
he
begged
me
to
destroy
the
affidavit
i
heard
no
more
about
swearing
to
our
receipts
on
tuesday
september
i
informed
miss
lind
that
judging
by
present
appearances
her
portion
of
the
proceeds
of
the
first
concert
would
amount
to
she
immediately
resolved
to
devote
every
dollar
of
it
to
charity
and
sending
for
mayor
woodhull
she
acted
under
his
and
my
advice
in
selecting
the
various
institutions
among
which
she
wished
the
amount
to
be
distributed
my
arrangements
of
the
concert
room
were
very
complete
the
great
and
gallery
of
castle
garden
were
divided
by
imaginary
lines
into
four
compartments
each
of
which
was
designated
by
a
lamp
of
a
different
color
the
tickets
were
printed
in
colors
corresponding
with
the
location
which
the
holders
were
to
occupy
and
one
hundred
ushers
with
rosettes
and
bearing
wands
tipped
with
ribbons
of
the
several
hues
enabled
every
individual
to
find
his
or
her
seat
without
the
slightest
difficulty
every
seat
was
of
course
numbered
in
color
to
correspond
with
the
check
which
each
person
retained
after
giving
up
an
entrance
ticket
at
the
door
thus
tickets
checks
lamps
rosettes
wands
and
even
the
seat
numbers
were
all
in
the
appropriate
colors
to
designate
the
different
departments
these
arrangements
were
duly
advertised
and
every
particular
was
also
printed
upon
each
ticket
in
order
to
prevent
confusion
the
doors
were
opened
at
five
o
clock
while
the
concert
did
not
commence
until
eight
the
consequence
was
that
although
about
five
thousand
persons
were
present
at
the
first
concert
their
entrance
was
marked
with
as
much
order
and
quiet
as
was
ever
witnessed
in
the
assembling
of
a
congregation
at
church
these
precautions
were
observed
at
all
the
concerts
given
throughout
the
country
under
my
administration
and
the
good
order
which
always
prevailed
was
the
subject
of
numberless
encomiums
from
the
public
and
the
press
the
reception
of
jenny
lind
on
her
first
appearance
in
point
of
enthusiasm
was
probably
never
before
equalled
in
the
world
as
benedict
led
her
towards
the
the
entire
audience
rose
to
their
feet
and
welcomed
her
with
three
cheers
accompanied
by
the
waving
of
thousands
of
hats
and
handkerchiefs
this
was
by
far
the
largest
audience
to
which
jenny
lind
had
ever
sung
she
was
evidently
much
agitated
but
the
orchestra
commenced
and
before
she
had
sung
a
dozen
notes
of
casta
diva
she
began
to
recover
her
and
long
before
the
was
concluded
she
was
as
calm
as
if
she
was
in
her
own
towards
the
last
portion
of
the
the
audience
were
so
completely
carried
away
by
their
feelings
that
the
remainder
of
the
air
was
drowned
in
a
perfect
tempest
of
acclamation
enthusiasm
had
been
wrought
to
its
highest
pitch
but
the
musical
powers
of
jenny
lind
exceeded
all
the
brilliant
anticipations
which
had
been
formed
and
her
triumph
was
complete
at
the
conclusion
of
the
concert
jenny
lind
was
loudly
called
for
and
was
obliged
to
appear
three
times
before
the
audience
could
be
satisfied
they
then
called
vociferously
for
barnum
and
i
reluctantly
responded
to
their
demand
on
this
first
night
julius
benedict
firmly
established
with
the
american
people
his
european
reputation
as
a
most
accomplished
conductor
and
musical
composer
while
signor
belletti
inspired
an
admiration
which
grew
warmer
and
deeper
in
the
minds
of
the
american
people
to
the
end
of
his
career
in
this
country
it
would
seem
as
if
the
jenny
lind
mania
had
reached
its
culminating
point
before
she
appeared
and
i
confess
that
i
feared
the
anticipations
of
the
public
were
too
high
to
be
realized
and
hence
that
there
would
be
a
reaction
after
the
first
concert
but
i
was
happily
disappointed
the
transcendent
musical
genius
of
the
swedish
nightingale
was
superior
to
all
that
fancy
could
paint
and
the
furor
did
not
attain
its
highest
point
until
she
had
been
heard
the
people
were
in
ecstasies
the
powers
of
editorial
acumen
types
and
ink
were
inadequate
to
sound
her
praises
the
rubicon
was
passed
the
successful
issue
of
the
jenny
lind
enterprise
was
established
i
think
there
were
a
hundred
men
in
new
york
the
day
after
her
first
concert
who
would
have
willingly
paid
me
for
my
contract
i
received
repeated
offers
for
an
eighth
a
tenth
or
a
sixteenth
equivalent
to
that
price
but
mine
had
been
the
risk
and
i
was
determined
mine
should
be
the
triumph
so
elated
was
i
with
my
success
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
and
false
prophets
that
i
do
not
think
half
a
million
of
dollars
would
have
tempted
me
to
relinquish
the
enterprise
upon
settling
the
receipts
of
the
first
concert
they
were
found
to
be
somewhat
less
than
i
anticipated
the
sums
bid
at
the
auction
sales
together
with
the
tickets
purchased
at
private
sale
amounted
to
more
than
it
proved
however
that
several
of
the
tickets
bid
off
at
from
to
each
were
not
called
for
in
some
instances
probably
the
zeal
of
the
bidders
cooled
down
when
they
came
out
from
the
scene
of
excitement
and
once
more
breathed
the
fresh
which
came
sweeping
up
from
the
narrows
while
perhaps
in
other
instances
bids
were
made
by
parties
who
never
intended
to
take
the
tickets
i
can
only
say
once
for
all
that
i
was
never
privy
to
a
false
bid
and
was
so
particular
upon
that
point
that
i
would
not
permit
one
of
my
employees
to
bid
on
or
purchase
a
ticket
at
auction
though
requested
to
do
so
for
especial
friends
the
amount
of
money
received
for
tickets
to
the
first
concert
was
as
this
made
miss
lind
s
portion
too
small
to
realize
the
which
had
been
announced
as
devoted
to
charity
i
proposed
to
divide
equally
with
her
the
proceeds
of
the
first
two
concerts
and
not
count
them
at
all
in
our
regular
engagement
accordingly
the
second
concert
was
given
september
and
the
receipts
amounting
to
were
like
those
of
the

and

i
performed
during
the

four
weeks
after
jenny
lind
s
arrival
anticipating
much
of
this
i
had
spent
some
time
in
august
at
the
white
mountains
to
recruit
my
energies
of
course
i
had
not
been
idle
during
the
summer
i
had
put
innumerable
means
and
appliances
into
operation
for
the
furtherance
of
my
object
and
little
did
the
public
see
of
the
hand
that
indirectly
pulled
at
their
preparatory
to
a
relaxation
of
their
and
these
means
and
appliances
were
continued
and
enlarged
throughout
the
whole
of
that
triumphal
musical
campaign
the
first
great
assembly
at
castle
garden
was
not
gathered
by
jenny
lind
s
musical
genius
and
powers
alone
she
was
effectually
introduced
to
the
public
before
they
had
seen
or
heard
her
she
appeared
in
the
presence
of
a
jury
already
excited
to
enthusiasm
in
her
behalf
she
more
than
met
their
expectations
and
all
the
means
i
had
adopted
to
prepare
the
way
were
thus
abundantly
justified
as
a
manager
i
worked
by
setting
others
to
work
biographies
of
the
swedish
nightingale
were
largely
circulated
foreign
correspondence
glorified
her
talents
and
triumphs
by
narratives
of
her
benevolence
and
printer
s
ink
was
invoked
in
every
possible
form
to
put
and
keep
jenny
lind
before
the
people
i
am
happy
to
say
that
the
press
generally
echoed
the
voice
of
her
praise
from
first
to
last
i
could
fill
many
volumes
with
printed
extracts
which
are
nearly
all
of
a
similar
tenor
to
the
following
unbought
unsolicited
editorial
article
which
appeared
in

of
the
day
before
the
first
concert
given
by
miss

in
the
united

jenny

and

what
ancient
monarch
was
he
either
in
history
or
in
fable
who
offered
half
his
kingdom
the
price
of
box
tickets
and
choice
seats
in
those
days
for
the
invention
of
an
original
sensation
or
the
discovery
of
a
fresh
pleasure
that
sensation
that
pleasure
which
royal
power
in
the
old
world
failed
to
discover
has
been
called
into
existence
at
a
less
price
by
barnum
a
plain
republican
and
is
now
about
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
sovereigns
of
the
new
world
jenny

the
most
remarkable
phenomenon
in
musical
art
which
has
for
the
last
century
flashed
across
the
horizon
of
the
old
world
is
now
among
us
and
will
make
her
night
to
a
house
of
nearly
ten
thousand
listeners
yielding
in
proceeds
by
auction
a
sum
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
the
last
ten
days
our
musical
reporters
have
furnished
our
readers
with
every
matter
connected
with
her
arrival
in
this
metropolis
and
the
steps
adopted
by
barnum
in
preparation
for
her
first
appearance
the
proceedings
of
yesterday
consisting
of
the
sale
of
the
remainder
of
the
tickets
and
the
astonishing
the
wonderful
sensation
produced
at
her
first
rehearsal
on
the
few
persons
critics
in
musical
art
who
were
admitted
on
the
occasion
will
be
found
elsewhere
in
our
columns
we
concur
in
everything
that
has
been
said
by
our
musical
reporter
describing
her
extraordinary
genius
her
unrivalled
combination
of
power
and
art
nothing
has
been
exaggerated
not
an
iota
three
years
ago
more
or
less
we
heard
jenny
lind
on
many
occasions
when
she
made
the
first
great
sensation
in
europe
by
her
at
the
london
opera
house
then
she
was
great
in
power
in
art
in
genius
now
she
is
greater
in
all
we
speak
from
experience
and
conviction
then
she
astonished
and
pleased
and
fascinated
the
thousands
of
the
british
aristocracy
now
she
will
fascinate
and
please
and
delight
and
almost
make
mad
with
musical
excitement
the
millions
of
the
american
democracy
night
this
new
sensation
this
fresh
movement
this
excitement
excelling
all
former
excitements
will
be
called
into
existence
when
she
pours
out
the
notes
of
and
exhibits
her
astonishing
powers
her
wonderful
peculiarities
that
seem
more
of
heaven
than
of
earth
more
of
a
voice
from
eternity
than
from
the
lips
of
a
human
being
we
speak
soberly
seriously
calmly
the
public
expectation
has
run
very
high
for
the
last
week
higher
than
at
any
former
period
of
our
past
musical
annals
but
high
as
it
has
risen
the
reality
the
fact
the
concert
the
voice
and
power
of
jenny
lind
will
far
surpass
all
past
expectation
jenny
lind
is
a
wonder
and
a
prodigy
in
song
and
no
as
usual
however
the
very
soon
took
it
all
back
and
roundly
abused
miss
lind
and
persistently
attacked
her
manager
as
usual
too
the
public
paid
no
attention
to
the
and
doubled
their
patronage
of
the
jenny
lind
concerts
after
the
first
month
the
business
became
thoroughly
systematized
and
by
the
help
of
such
agents
as
my
faithful
treasurer
stewart
and
the
indefatigable
le
grand
smith
my
personal
labors
were
materially
relieved
but
from
the
first
concert
on
the
of
september
until
the
concert
on
the
of
june
a
space
of
nine
months
i
did
not
know
a
waking
moment
that
was
entirely
free
from
anxiety
i
could
not
hope
to
be
exempted
from
trouble
and
perplexity
in
managing
an
enterprise
which
depended
altogether
on
popular
favor
and
which
involved
great
consequences
to
myself
but
i
did
not
expect
the
numerous
petty
annoyances
which
beset
me
especially
in
the
early
period
of
the
concerts
miss
lind
did
not
dream
nor
did
any
one
else
of
the
unparalleled
enthusiasm
that
would
greet
her
and
the
first
immense
assembly
at
castle
garden
somewhat
prepared
her
i
suspect
to
listen
to
evil
advisers
it
would
seem
that
the
terms
of
our
revised
contract
were
sufficiently
liberal
to
her
and
sufficiently
hazardous
to
myself
to
justify
the
expectation
of
perfectly
honorable
treatment
but
certain
envious
intermeddlers
appeared
to
think
differently
do
you
not
see
miss
lind
that
barnum
is
coining
money
out
of
your
genius
said
they
of
course
she
saw
it
but
the
swede
despised
and
spurned
the
advisers
who
recommended
her
to
repudiate
her
contract
with
me
at
all
hazards
and
take
the
enterprise
into
her
own
hands
possibly
to
put
it
into
theirs
i
however
suffered
much
from
the
unreasonable
interference
of
her
lawyer
john
jay
benedict
and
belletti
behaved
like
men
and
jenny
afterwards
expressed
to
me
her
regret
that
she
had
for
a
moment
listened
to
the
vexatious
exactions
of
her
legal
counsellor
to
show
the
difficulties
with
which
i
had
to
contend
thus
early
in
my
enterprise
i
copy
a
letter
which
i
wrote
a
little
more
than
one
month
after
miss
lind
commenced
her
engagement
with
me
to
my
friend
joshua
bates
of
baring
brothers
london
new
york
joshua
bates
esq
dear
sir
i
take
the
liberty
to
write
you
a
few
lines
merely
to
say
that
we
are
getting
along
as
well
as
could
reasonably
be
expected
in
this
country
you
are
aware
that
the
rapid
accumulation
of
wealth
always
creates
much
envy
and
envy
soon
augments
to
malice
such
are
the
elements
at
work
to
a
limited
degree
against
myself
and
although
miss
lind
benedict
and
myself
have
never
as
yet
had
the
slightest
feelings
between
us
to
my
knowledge
except
those
of
friendship
yet
i
can
not
well
see
how
this
can
long
continue
in
face
of
the
fact
that
nearly
every
day
they
allow
persons
some
moving
in
the
first
classes
of
society
to
approach
them
and
spend
hours
in
traducing
me
even
her
attorney
john
jay
has
been
so
blind
to
her
interests
as
to
aid
in
poisoning
her
mind
against
me
by
pouring
into
her
ears
the
most
silly
twaddle
all
of
which
amounts
to
nothing
and
less
than
nothing
such
as
the
regret
that
i
was
a
showman
exhibitor
of
tom
thumb
etc
without
the
elements
which
i
possess
for
business
as
well
as
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
acquired
in
catering
for
the
public
the
result
of
her
concerts
here
would
not
have
been
pecuniarily
one
half
as
much
as
at
present
and
such
men
as
the
hon
edward
everett
howland
and
others
will
tell
you
that
there
is
no
charlatanism
or
lack
of
dignity
in
my
management
of
these
concerts
i
know
as
well
as
any
person
that
the
merits
of
jenny
lind
are
the
best
capital
to
depend
upon
to
secure
public
favor
and
i
have
thus
far
acted
on
this
knowledge
everything
which
money
and
attention
can
procure
for
their
comfort
they
have
and
i
am
glad
to
know
that
they
are
satisfied
on
this
score
all
i
fear
is
that
these
continual
backbitings
if
listened
to
by
her
will
by
and
by
produce
a
feeling
of
distrust
or
regret
which
will
lead
to
unpleasant
results
the
fact
is
her
mind
ought
to
be
as
free
as
air
and
she
herself
as
free
as
a
bird
and
being
satisfied
of
my
probity
and
ability
she
should
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
envious
and
malevolent
attacks
on
me
i
have
hoped
that
by
thus
briefly
stating
to
you
the
facts
in
the
case
you
might
be
induced
for
her
interests
as
well
as
mine
to
drop
a
line
of
advice
to
benedict
and
another
to
jay
on
this
subject
if
i
am
asking
or
expecting
too
much
i
pray
you
to
not
give
it
a
thought
for
i
feel
myself
fully
able
to
carry
through
my
rights
alone
although
i
should
deplore
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
obliged
to
do
so
in
a
feeling
of
unfriendliness
i
have
risked
much
money
on
the
issue
of
this
speculation
it
has
proved
successful
i
am
full
of
perplexity
and
anxiety
and
labor
continually
for
success
and
i
can
not
allow
ignorance
or
envy
to
rob
me
of
the
fruits
of
my
enterprise
sincerely
and
gratefully
yours
barnum
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
enter
into
full
details
of
all
of
the
lind
concerts
though
i
have
given
elsewhere
a
transcript
from
the
account
books
of
my
treasurer
presenting
a
table
of
the
place
and
exact
receipts
of
each
concert
this
will
gratify
curiosity
and
at
the
same
time
indicate
our
route
of
travel
meanwhile
i
devote
a
few
pages
to
interesting
incidents
connected
with
miss
lind
s
visit
to
america
jenny
lind
s
character
for
benevolence
became
so
generally
known
that
her
door
was
beset
by
persons
asking
charity
and
she
was
in
the
receipt
while
in
the
principal
cities
of
numerous
letters
all
on
the
same
subject
her
secretary
examined
and
responded
favorably
to
some
of
them
he
undertook
at
first
to
answer
them
all
but
finally
abandoned
that
course
in
despair
i
knew
of
many
instances
in
which
she
gave
sums
of
money
to
applicants
varying
in
amount
from
to
and
in
one
instance
she
gave
to
a
swedish
friend
one
night
while
giving
a
concert
in
boston
a
girl
approached
the
and
laying
down
for
a
ticket
remarked
there
goes
half
a
month
s
earnings
but
i
am
determined
to
hear
jenny
miss
lind
s
secretary
heard
the
remark
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
coming
into
her
room
he
laughingly
related
the
circumstance
would
you
know
the
girl
again
asked
jenny
with
an
earnest
look
upon
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
she
instantly
placed
a
in
his
hand
and
said
poor
girl
give
her
that
with
my
best
he
at
once
found
the
girl
who
cried
with
joy
when
she
received
the
and
heard
the
kind
words
with
which
the
gift
was
accompanied
the
night
after
jenny
s
arrival
in
boston
a
display
of
fireworks
was
given
in
her
honor
in
front
of
the
revere
house
after
which
followed
a
beautiful
torchlight
procession
by
the
germans
of
that
city
on
her
return
from
boston
to
new
york
jenny
her
companion
and
benedict
and
belletti
stopped
at
iranistan
my
residence
in
bridgeport
where
they
remained
until
the
following
day
the
morning
after
her
arrival
she
took
my
arm
and
proposed
a
promenade
through
the
grounds
she
seemed
much
pleased
and
said
i
am
astonished
that
you
should
have
left
such
a
beautiful
place
for
the
sake
of
travelling
through
the
country
with
the
same
day
she
told
me
in
a
playful
mood
that
she
had
heard
a
most
extraordinary
report
i
have
heard
that
you
and
i
are
about
to
be
married
said
she
now
how
could
such
an
absurd
report
ever
have
originated
probably
from
the
fact
that
we
are
engaged
i
replied
she
enjoyed
a
joke
and
laughed
heartily
do
you
know
barnum
said
she
that
if
you
had
not
built
iranistan
i
should
never
have
come
to
america
for
you
i
expressed
my
surprise
and
asked
her
to
explain
i
had
received
several
applications
to
visit
the
united
states
she
continued
but
i
did
not
much
like
the
appearance
of
the
applicants
nor
did
i
relish
the
idea
of
crossing
miles
of
ocean
so
i
declined
them
all
but
the
first
letter
which
wilton
your
agent
addressed
me
was
written
upon
a
sheet
headed
with
a
beautiful
engraving
of
iranistan
it
attracted
my
attention
i
said
to
myself
a
gentleman
who
has
been
so
successful
in
his
business
as
to
be
able
to
build
and
reside
in
such
a
palace
can
not
be
a
mere
so
i
wrote
to
your
agent
and
consented
to
an
interview
which
i
should
have
declined
if
i
had
not
seen
the
picture
of
iranistan
that
then
fully
pays
me
for
building
it
i
replied
for
i
intend
and
expect
to
make
more
by
this
musical
enterprise
than
iranistan
cost
i
really
hope
so
she
replied
but
you
must
not
be
too
sanguine
you
know
man
proposes
but
god
jenny
lind
always
desired
to
reach
a
place
in
which
she
was
to
sing
without
having
the
time
of
her
arrival
known
thus
avoiding
the
excitement
of
promiscuous
crowds
as
a
manager
however
i
knew
that
the
interests
of
the
enterprise
depended
in
a
great
degree
upon
these
excitements
although
it
frequently
seemed
inconceivable
to
her
how
so
many
thousands
should
have
discovered
her
secret
and
consequently
gathered
together
to
receive
her
i
was
not
so
much
astonished
inasmuch
as
my
agent
always
had
early
telegraphic
intelligence
of
the
time
of
her
anticipated
arrival
and
was
not
slow
in
communicating
the
information
to
the
public
on
reaching
philadelphia
a
large
concourse
of
persons
awaited
the
approach
of
the
steamer
which
conveyed
her
with
difficulty
we
pressed
through
the
crowd
and
were
followed
by
many
thousands
to
jones
s
hotel
the
street
in
front
of
the
building
was
densely
packed
by
the
populace
and
poor
jenny
who
was
suffering
from
a
severe
headache
retired
to
her
apartments
i
tried
to
induce
the
crowd
to
disperse
but
they
declared
they
would
not
do
so
until
jenny
lind
should
appear
on
the
balcony
i
would
not
disturb
her
and
knowing
that
the
tumult
might
prove
an
annoyance
to
her
i
placed
her
bonnet
and
shawl
upon
her
companion
miss
ahmansen
and
led
her
out
on
the
balcony
she
bowed
gracefully
to
the
multitude
who
gave
her
three
hearty
cheers
and
quietly
dispersed
miss
lind
was
so
utterly
averse
to
any
thing
like
deception
that
we
never
ventured
to
tell
her
the
part
which
her
bonnet
and
shawl
had
played
in
the
absence
of
their
owner
jenny
was
in
the
habit
of
attending
church
whenever
she
could
do
so
without
attracting
notice
she
always
preserved
her
nationality
also
by
inquiring
out
and
attending
swedish
churches
wherever
they
could
be
found
she
gave
to
a
swedish
church
in
chicago
while
in
boston
a
poor
swedish
girl
a
domestic
in
a
family
at
roxbury
called
on
jenny
she
detained
her
visitor
several
hours
talking
about
home
and
other
matters
and
in
the
evening
took
her
in
her
carriage
to
the
concert
gave
her
a
seat
and
sent
her
back
to
roxbury
in
a
carriage
at
the
close
of
the
performances
i
have
no
doubt
the
poor
girl
carried
with
her
substantial
evidences
of
her
countrywoman
s
bounty
my
eldest
daughter
caroline
and
her
friend
lyman
of
bridgeport
accompanied
me
on
the
tour
from
new
york
to
havana
and
thence
home
new
orleans
and
the
mississippi
we
were
at
baltimore
on
the
sabbath
and
my
daughter
accompanying
a
friend
who
resided
in
the
city
to
church
took
a
seat
with
her
in
the
choir
and
joined
in
the
singing
a
number
of
the
congregation
who
had
seen
caroline
with
me
the
day
previous
and
supposed
her
to
be
jenny
lind
were
yet
laboring
under
the
same
mistake
and
it
was
soon
whispered
through
the
church
that
jenny
lind
was
in
the
choir
the
excitement
was
worked
to
its
highest
pitch
when
my
daughter
rose
as
one
of
the
musical
group
every
ear
was
on
the
alert
to
catch
the
first
notes
of
her
voice
and
when
she
sang
glances
of
satisfaction
passed
through
the
assembly
caroline
quite
unconscious
of
the
attention
she
attracted
continued
to
sing
to
the
end
of
the
hymn
not
a
note
was
lost
upon
the
ears
of
the
attentive
congregation
what
an
exquisite
singer
heavenly
sounds
i
never
heard
the
like
and
similar
expressions
were
whispered
through
the
church
at
the
conclusion
of
the
services
my
daughter
and
her
friend
found
the
passage
way
to
their
carriage
blocked
by
a
crowd
who
were
anxious
to
obtain
a
nearer
view
of
the
swedish
nightingale
and
many
persons
that
afternoon
boasted
in
good
faith
that
they
had
listened
to
the
extraordinary
singing
of
the
great
songstress
the
pith
of
the
joke
is
that
we
have
never
discovered
that
my
daughter
has
any
extraordinary
claims
as
a
vocalist
our
orchestra
in
new
york
consisted
of
sixty
when
we
started
on
our
southern
tour
we
took
with
us
permanently
as
the
orchestra
twelve
of
the
best
musicians
we
could
select
and
in
new
orleans
augmented
the
force
to
sixteen
we
increased
the
number
to
forty
or
fifty
as
the
case
might
be
by
choice
of
musicians
residing
where
the
concerts
were
given
on
our
return
to
new
york
from
havana
we
enlarged
the
orchestra
to
one
hundred
performers
the
morning
after
our
arrival
in
washington
president
fillmore
called
and
left
his
card
jenny
being
out
when
she
returned
and
found
the
token
of
his
attention
she
was
in
something
of
a
flurry
come
said
she
we
must
call
on
the
president
why
so
i
inquired
because
he
has
called
on
me
and
of
course
that
is
equivalent
to
a
command
for
me
to
go
to
his
i
assured
her
that
she
might
make
her
mind
at
ease
for
whatever
might
be
the
custom
with
crowned
heads
our
presidents
were
not
wont
to
command
the
movements
of
strangers
and
that
she
would
be
quite
in
time
if
she
returned
his
call
the
next
day
she
did
so
and
was
charmed
with
the
unaffected
bearing
of
the
president
and
the
warm
kindnesses
expressed
by
his
amiable
wife
and
daughter
and
consented
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
in
conformity
with
their
request
she
was
accompanied
to
the
white
house
by
messrs
benedict
belletti
and
myself
and
several
happy
hours
were
spent
in
the
private
circle
of
the
president
s
family
benedict
who
engaged
in
a
long
quiet
conversation
with
fillmore
was
highly
pleased
with
the
interview
a
foreigner
accustomed
to
court
etiquette
is
generally
surprised
at
the
simplicity
which
characterizes
the
chief
magistrate
of
this
union
in
i
called
on
the
president
with
my
friend
the
late
brettell
of
london
who
resided
in
james
palace
and
was
quite
a
worshipper
of
the
queen
and
an
ardent
admirer
of
all
the
dignities
and
ceremonies
of
royalty
he
expected
something
of
the
kind
in
visiting
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
was
highly
pleased
with
his
disappointment
both
concerts
in
washington
were
attended
by
the
president
and
his
family
and
every
member
of
the
cabinet
i
noticed
also
among
the
audience
henry
clay
benton
foote
cass
and
general
scott
and
nearly
every
member
of
congress
on
the
following
morning
miss
lind
was
called
upon
by
webster
clay
general
cass
and
colonel
benton
and
all
parties
were
evidently
gratified
i
had
introduced
webster
to
her
in
boston
upon
hearing
one
of
her
wild
mountain
songs
in
new
york
and
also
in
washington
webster
signified
his
approval
by
rising
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
making
a
profound
bow
jenny
was
delighted
by
this
expression
of
praise
from
the
great
statesman
when
i
first
introduced
miss
lind
to
webster
at
the
revere
house
in
boston
she
was
greatly
impressed
with
his
manners
and
conversation
and
after
his
departure
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
great
excitement
exclaiming
ah
barnum
that
is
a
man
i
have
never
before
seen
such
a
man
we
visited
the
capitol
while
both
houses
were
in
session
miss
lind
took
the
arm
of
hon
cleveland
representative
from
connecticut
and
was
by
him
escorted
into
various
parts
of
the
capitol
and
the
grounds
with
all
of
which
she
was
much
pleased
while
i
was
in
washington
an
odd
reminiscence
of
my
old
in
the
south
came
back
to
me
in
a
curious
way
some
years
before
in
my
travelling
show
company
had
stopped
at
a
hotel
in
jackson
mississippi
and
as
the
house
was
crowded
soon
after
i
went
to
bed
five
or
six
men
came
into
the
room
with
cards
and
a
candle
and
asked
permission
as
there
was
no
other
place
to
sit
down
and
play
a
quiet
game
of
i
consented
on
condition
that
i
might
get
up
and
participate
which
was
permitted
and
in
a
very
little
while
as
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
game
i
lost
fifty
dollars
good
hands
and
good
fortune
soon
enabled
me
to
win
back
my
money
at
which
point
one
of
the
players
who
had
been
introduced
to
me
as
lawyer
foote
said
now
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
back
to
bed
you
don
t
know
anything
about
the
game
and
these
fellows
do
and
they
ll
skin
i
acted
upon
his
advice
and
now
years
afterwards
when
senator
foote
called
upon
miss
lind
the
story
came
back
to
me
and
while
i
was
talking
with
him
i
remarked
fifteen
years
ago
when
i
was
in
the
south
i
became
acquainted
with
a
lawyer
named
foote
at
jackson
it
must
have
been
me
said
the
senator
i
am
the
only
lawyer
foote
of
jackson
oh
no
it
could
not
have
been
you
and
i
told
him
the
story
it
was
me
he
whispered
in
my
ear
and
added
i
used
to
gamble
like
h
l
in
those
during
the
week
i
was
invited
with
miss
lind
and
her
immediate
friends
to
visit
mount
vernon
with
colonel
washington
the
then
proprietor
and
seaton
of
washington
and
editor
of
the
colonel
washington
chartered
a
steamboat
for
the
purpose
we
were
landed
a
short
distance
from
the
tomb
which
we
first
visited
proceeding
to
the
house
we
were
introduced
to
washington
and
several
other
ladies
much
interest
was
manifested
by
miss
lind
in
examining
the
mementoes
of
the
great
man
whose
home
it
had
been
a
beautiful
collation
was
spread
out
and
arranged
in
fine
taste
before
leaving
washington
presented
jenny
with
a
book
from
the
library
with
the
name
of
washington
written
by
his
own
hand
she
was
much
overcome
at
receiving
this
present
called
me
aside
and
expressed
her
desire
to
give
something
in
return
i
have
nothing
with
me
she
said
excepting
this
watch
and
chain
and
i
will
give
that
if
you
think
it
will
be
i
knew
the
watch
was
very
valuable
and
told
her
that
so
costly
a
present
would
not
be
expected
nor
would
it
be
proper
the
expense
is
nothing
compared
to
the
value
of
that
book
she
replied
with
deep
emotion
but
as
the
watch
was
a
present
from
a
dear
friend
perhaps
i
should
not
give
it
jenny
lind
i
am
sure
never
forgot
the
pleasurable
emotions
of
that
day
at
richmond
half
an
hour
previous
to
her
departure
hundreds
of
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
had
crowded
into
the
halls
of
the
house
to
secure
a
glimpse
of
her
at
parting
i
informed
her
that
she
would
find
difficulty
in
passing
out
how
long
is
it
before
we
must
start
she
asked
half
an
hour
i
replied
oh
i
will
clear
the
passages
before
that
time
said
she
with
a
smile
whereupon
she
went
into
the
upper
hall
and
informed
the
people
that
she
wished
to
take
the
hands
of
every
one
of
them
upon
one
condition
viz
they
should
pass
by
her
in
rotation
and
as
fast
as
they
had
shaken
hands
proceed
down
stairs
and
not
block
up
the
passages
they
joyfully
consented
to
the
arrangement
and
in
fifteen
minutes
the
course
was
clear
poor
jenny
had
shaken
hands
with
every
person
in
the
crowd
and
i
presume
she
had
a
feeling
remembrance
of
the
incident
for
an
hour
or
two
at
least
she
was
waited
on
by
many
members
of
the
legislature
while
in
richmond
that
body
being
in
session
while
we
were
there
the
voyage
from
wilmington
to
charleston
was
an
exceedingly
rough
and
perilous
one
we
were
about
hours
in
making
the
passage
the
usual
time
being
seventeen
there
was
really
great
danger
of
our
steamer
being
swamped
and
we
were
all
apprehensive
that
we
should
never
reach
the
port
of
charleston
alive
some
of
the
passengers
were
in
great
terror
jenny
lind
exhibited
more
calmness
upon
this
occasion
than
any
other
person
the
crew
excepted
we
arrived
safely
at
last
and
i
was
grieved
to
learn
that
for
twelve
hours
the
loss
of
the
steamer
had
been
considered
certain
and
had
even
been
announced
by
telegraph
in
the
northern
cities
we
remained
at
charleston
about
ten
days
to
take
the
steamer
isabella
on
her
regular
trip
to
havana
jenny
had
been
through
so
much
excitement
at
the
north
that
she
determined
to
have
quiet
here
and
therefore
declined
receiving
any
calls
this
disappointed
many
ladies
and
gentlemen
one
young
lady
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
planter
near
augusta
was
so
determined
upon
seeing
her
in
private
that
she
paid
one
of
the
servants
to
allow
her
to
put
on
a
cap
and
white
apron
and
carry
in
the
tray
for
jenny
s
tea
i
afterwards
told
miss
lind
of
the
joke
and
suggested
that
after
such
an
evidence
of
admiration
she
should
receive
a
call
from
the
young
lady
it
is
not
admiration
it
is
only
curiosity
replied
jenny
and
i
will
not
encourage
such
christmas
was
at
hand
and
jenny
lind
determined
to
honor
it
in
the
way
she
had
often
done
in
sweden
she
had
a
beautiful
christmas
tree
privately
prepared
and
from
its
boughs
depended
a
variety
of
presents
for
members
of
the
company
these
gifts
were
encased
in
paper
with
the
names
of
the
recipients
written
on
each
after
spending
a
pleasant
evening
in
her
she
invited
us
into
the
parlor
where
the
surprise
awaited
us
each
person
commenced
opening
the
packages
bearing
his
or
her
address
and
although
every
individual
had
one
or
more
pretty
presents
she
had
prepared
a
joke
for
each
benedict
for
instance
took
off
wrapper
after
wrapper
from
one
of
his
packages
which
at
first
was
as
large
as
his
head
but
after
having
removed
some
forty
coverings
of
paper
it
was
reduced
to
a
size
smaller
than
his
hand
and
the
removal
of
the
last
envelope
exposed
to
view
a
piece
of
cavendish
tobacco
one
of
my
presents
choicely
wrapped
in
a
dozen
coverings
was
a
jolly
young
bacchus
in
parian
marble
intended
as
a
pleasant
hit
at
my
temperance
principles
the
night
before
new
year
s
day
was
spent
in
her
apartment
with
great
hilarity
enlivened
by
music
singing
dancing
and
the
hours
glided
swiftly
away
miss
lind
asked
me
if
i
would
dance
with
her
i
told
her
my
education
had
been
neglected
in
that
line
and
that
i
had
never
danced
in
my
life
that
is
all
the
better
said
she
now
dance
with
me
in
a
cotillion
i
am
sure
you
can
do
she
was
a
beautiful
dancer
and
i
never
saw
her
laugh
more
heartily
than
she
did
at
my
awkwardness
she
said
she
would
give
me
the
credit
of
being
the
poorest
dancer
she
ever
saw
about
a
quarter
before
twelve
jenny
suddenly
checked
burke
formerly
celebrated
as
the
musical
prodigy
master
burke
who
was
playing
on
the
piano
by
saying
pray
let
us
have
quiet
do
you
see
in
fifteen
minutes
more
this
year
will
be
gone
forever
she
immediately
took
a
seat
and
rested
her
head
upon
her
hand
in
silence
we
all
sat
down
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
most
profound
quiet
reigned
in
the
apartment
the
remainder
of
the
scene
i
transcribe
from
a
description
written
the
next
day
by
lyman
who
was
present
on
the
occasion
the
clock
of
a
neighboring
church
struck
the
knell
of
the
dying
year
all
were
silent
each
heart
was
left
to
its
own
communings
and
the
bowed
head
and
tearful
eye
told
that
memory
was
busy
with
the
past
it
was
a
brief
moment
but
thoughts
and
feelings
were
crowded
into
it
which
render
it
one
never
to
be
forgotten
a
moment
more
the
last
stroke
of
the
clock
had
fallen
upon
the
ear
the
last
faint
vibration
ceased
another
period
of
time
had
passed
forever
away
a
new
one
had
dawned
in
which
each
felt
that
they
were
to
live
and
act
this
thought
recalled
them
to
a
full
consciousness
of
the
present
and
all
arose
and
quietly
but
cordially
presented
to
each
other
the
kind
wishes
of
the
season
as
the
lovely
hostess
pressed
the
hands
of
her
guests
it
was
evident
that
she
too
had
wept
she
the
gifted
the
admired
the
almost
idolized
one
had
she
too
cause
for
tears
whence
were
they
from
the
overflowings
of
a
grateful
heart
from
tender
associations
or
from
sad
remembrances
none
knew
none
could
ask
though
they
awakened
deep
and
peculiar
sympathy
and
from
one
heart
at
least
arose
the
prayer
that
when
the
dial
of
time
should
mark
the
last
hour
of
her
earthly
existence
she
should
greet
its
approach
with
joy
and
not
with
grief
that
to
her
soul
might
whisper
come
sweet
sister
come
to
the
realms
of
unfading
light
and
love
come
join
your
seraphic
tones
with
ours
in
singing
the
praises
of
him
who
loved
us
and
gave
himself
for
us
while
she
with
hands
and
eye
should
answer
yes
gladly
and
without
fear
i
come
for
i
know
that
my
redeemer
i
had
arranged
with
a
man
in
new
york
to
transport
furniture
to
havana
provide
a
house
and
board
jenny
lind
and
our
immediate
party
during
our
stay
when
we
arrived
we
found
the
building
converted
into
a
and
the
apartments
were
any
thing
but
comfortable
jenny
was
vexed
soon
after
dinner
she
took
a
volante
and
an
interpreter
and
drove
into
the
suburbs
she
was
absent
four
hours
whither
or
why
she
had
gone
none
of
us
knew
at
length
she
returned
and
informed
us
that
she
had
hired
a
commodious
furnished
house
in
a
delightful
location
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
and
invited
us
all
to
go
and
live
with
her
during
our
stay
in
havana
and
we
accepted
the
invitation
she
was
now
freed
from
all
annoyances
her
time
was
her
own
she
received
no
calls
went
and
came
when
she
pleased
had
no
meddlesome
advisers
about
her
legal
or
otherwise
and
was
as
merry
as
a
cricket
we
had
a
large
in
the
rear
of
the
house
and
here
she
would
come
and
romp
and
run
sing
and
laugh
like
a
young
now
barnum
for
another
game
of
ball
she
would
say
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
whereupon
she
would
take
an
ball
of
which
she
had
two
or
three
and
commence
a
game
of
throwing
and
catching
which
would
be
kept
up
until
being
completely
tired
out
i
would
say
i
give
it
then
her
rich
musical
laugh
would
be
heard
ringing
through
the
house
as
she
exclaimed
oh
barnum
you
are
too
fat
and
too
lazy
you
can
not
stand
it
to
play
ball
with
me
her
celebrated
countrywoman
miss
frederika
bremer
spent
a
few
days
with
us
very
pleasantly
and
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
more
delightful
month
than
was
passed

in

with
the
evil
one
an
amazed
mulatto
soon
after
arriving
in
havana
i
discovered
that
a
strong
prejudice
existed
against
our
musical
enterprise
i
might
rather
say
that
the
habaneros
not
accustomed
to
the
high
figure
which
tickets
had
commanded
in
the
states
were
determined
on
forcing
me
to
adopt
their
opera
prices
whereas
i
paid
one
thousand
dollars
per
night
for
the
tacon
opera
house
and
other
expenses
being
in
proportion
i
was
determined
to
receive
remunerating
prices
or
give
no
concerts
this
determination
on
my
part
annoyed
the
habaneros
who
did
not
wish
to
be
thought
penurious
though
they
really
were
so
their
principal
spite
therefore
was
against
me
and
one
of
their
papers
politely
termed
me
a
yankee
pirate
who
cared
for
nothing
except
their
doubloons
they
attended
the
concert
but
were
determined
to
show
the
great
songstress
no
favor
i
perfectly
understood
this
feeling
in
advance
but
studiously
kept
all
knowledge
of
it
from
miss
lind
i
went
to
the
first
concert
therefore
with
some
misgivings
in
regard
to
her
reception
the
following
which
i
copy
from
the
havana
correspondence
of
the
york
gives
a
correct
account
of
it
jenny
lind
soon
appeared
led
on
by
signor
belletti
some
three
or
four
hundred
persons
clapped
their
hands
at
her
appearance
but
this
token
of
approbation
was
instantly
silenced
by
at
least
two
thousand
five
hundred
decided
hisses
thus
having
settled
the
matter
that
there
should
be
no
forestalling
of
public
opinion
and
that
if
applause
was
given
to
jenny
lind
in
that
house
it
should
first
be
incontestably
earned
the
most
solemn
silence
prevailed
i
have
heard
the
swedish
nightingale
often
in
europe
as
well
as
in
america
and
have
ever
noticed
a
distinct
tremulousness
attending
her
first
appearance
in
any
city
indeed
this
feeling
was
plainly
manifested
in
her
countenance
as
she
neared
the
but
when
she
witnessed
the
kind
of
reception
in
store
for
her
so
different
from
anything
she
had
reason
to
expect
her
countenance
changed
in
an
instant
to
a
haughty
her
eye
flashed
defiance
and
becoming
immovable
as
a
statue
she
stood
there
perfectly
calm
and
beautiful
she
was
satisfied
that
she
now
had
an
ordeal
to
pass
and
a
victory
to
gain
worthy
of
her
powers
in
a
moment
her
eye
scanned
the
immense
audience
the
music
began
and
then
followed
how
can
i
describe
it
such
heavenly
strains
as
i
verily
believe
mortal
never
breathed
except
jenny
lind
and
mortal
never
heard
except
from
her
lips
some
of
the
oldest
castilians
kept
a
frown
upon
their
brow
and
a
curling
sneer
upon
their
lip
their
ladies
however
and
most
of
the
audience
began
to
look
surprised
the
gushing
melody
flowed
on
increasing
in
beauty
and
glory
the
the
and
began
to
look
at
each
other
nearly
all
however
kept
their
teeth
clenched
and
their
lips
closed
evidently
determined
to
resist
to
the
last
the
torrent
flowed
deeper
and
faster
the
lark
flew
higher
and
higher
the
melody
grew
richer
and
grander
still
every
lip
was
compressed
by
and
by
as
the
rich
notes
came
dashing
in
rivers
upon
our
enraptured
ears
one
poor
critic
involuntarily
whispered
a
this
outbursting
of
the
soul
was
instantly
hissed
down
the
stream
of
harmony
rolled
on
till
at
the
close
it
made
a
clean
sweep
of
every
obstacle
and
carried
all
before
it
not
a
vestige
of
opposition
remained
but
such
a
tremendous
shout
of
applause
as
went
up
i
never
before
heard
the
triumph
was
most
complete
and
how
was
jenny
lind
affected
she
who
stood
a
few
moments
previous
like
adamant
now
trembled
like
a
reed
in
the
wind
before
the
storm
of
enthusiasm
which
her
own
simple
notes
had
produced
tremblingly
slowly
and
almost
bowing
her
face
to
the
ground
she
withdrew
the
roar
and
applause
of
victory
increased
encore
encore
came
from
every
lip
she
again
appeared
and
courtesying
low
again
withdrew
but
again
again
and
again
did
they
call
her
out
and
at
every
appearance
the
thunders
of
applause
rang
louder
and
louder
thus
five
times
was
jenny
lind
called
out
to
receive
their
unanimous
and
deafening
i
can
not
express
what
my
feelings
were
as
i
watched
this
scene
from
the
dress
circle
poor
jenny
i
deeply
sympathized
with
her
when
i
heard
that
first
hiss
i
indeed
observed
the
resolute
bearing
which
she
assumed
but
was
apprehensive
of
the
result
when
i
witnessed
her
triumph
i
could
not
restrain
the
tears
of
joy
that
rolled
down
my
cheeks
and
rushing
through
a
private
box
i
reached
the
stage
just
as
she
was
withdrawing
after
the
fifth
encore
god
bless
you
jenny
you
have
settled
them
i
exclaimed
are
you
satisfied
said
she
throwing
her
arms
around
my
neck
she
too
was
crying
with
joy
and
never
before
did
she
look
so
beautiful
in
my
eyes
as
on
that
evening
one
of
the
havana
papers
notwithstanding
the
great
triumph
continued
to
cry
out
for
low
prices
this
induced
many
to
absent
themselves
expecting
soon
to
see
a
reduction
it
had
been
understood
that
we
would
give
twelve
concerts
in
havana
but
when
they
saw
after
the
fourth
concert
which
was
devoted
to
charity
that
no
more
were
announced
they
became
uneasy
committees
waited
upon
us
requesting
more
concerts
but
we
peremptorily
declined
some
of
the
leading
dons
among
whom
was
count
penalver
then
offered
to
guarantee
us
for
three
concerts
my
reply
was
that
there
was
not
money
enough
on
the
island
of
cuba
to
induce
me
to
consent
to
it
that
settled
the
matter
and
gave
us
a
pleasant
opportunity
for
recreation
we
visited
by
invitation
brinckerhoff
the
eminent
american
merchant
at
matanzas
whom
i
had
met
at
the
same
place
three
years
previously
and
who
subsequently
had
visited
my
family
in
connecticut
the
gentlemanly
host
did
everything
in
his
power
to
render
our
stay
agreeable
and
miss
lind
was
so
delighted
with
his
attentions
and
the
interesting
details
of
sugar
and
coffee
plantations
which
we
visited
through
his
kindness
that
as
soon
as
she
returned
to
havana
she
sent
on
the
same
tour
of
pleasure
benedict
who
had
been
prevented
by
illness
from
accompanying
us
i
found
my
little
italian
vivalla
in
havana
he
called
on
me
frequently
he
was
in
great
distress
having
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
on
the
left
side
of
his
body
by
paralysis
he
was
thus
unable
to
earn
a
livelihood
although
he
still
kept
a
performing
dog
which
turned
a
and
performed
some
curious
tricks
one
day
as
i
was
passing
him
out
of
the
front
gate
miss
lind
inquired
who
he
was
i
briefly
recounted
to
her
his
history
she
expressed
deep
interest
in
his
case
and
said
something
should
be
set
apart
for
him
in
the
benefit
which
she
was
about
to
give
for
charity
accordingly
when
the
benefit
came
off
miss
lind
appropriated
to
him
and
i
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
his
return
to
his
friends
in
italy
at
the
same
benefit
were
distributed
between
two
hospitals
and
a
convent
a
few
mornings
after
the
benefit
our
bell
was
rung
and
the
servant
announced
that
i
was
wanted
i
went
to
the
door
and
found
a
large
procession
of
children
neatly
dressed
and
bearing
banners
attended
by
ten
or
twelve
priests
arrayed
in
their
rich
and
flowing
robes
i
inquired
their
business
and
was
informed
that
they
had
come
to
see
miss
lind
to
thank
her
in
person
for
her
benevolence
i
took
their
message
and
informed
miss
lind
that
the
leading
priests
of
the
convent
had
come
in
great
state
to
see
and
thank
her
i
will
not
see
them
she
replied
they
have
nothing
to
thank
me
for
if
i
have
done
good
it
is
no
more
than
my
duty
and
it
is
my
pleasure
i
do
not
deserve
their
thanks
and
i
will
not
see
i
returned
her
answer
and
the
leaders
of
the
grand
procession
went
away
in
disappointment
the
same
day
vivalla
called
and
brought
her
a
basket
of
the
most
luscious
fruit
that
he
could
procure
the
little
fellow
was
very
happy
and
extremely
grateful
miss
lind
had
gone
out
for
a
ride
god
bless
her
i
am
so
happy
she
is
such
a
good
lady
i
shall
see
my
brothers
and
sisters
again
oh
she
is
a
very
good
lady
said
poor
vivalla
overcome
by
his
feelings
he
begged
me
to
thank
her
for
him
and
give
her
the
fruit
as
he
was
passing
out
of
the
door
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
mr
barnum
i
should
like
so
much
to
have
the
good
lady
see
my
dog
turn
a
wheel
it
is
very
nice
he
can
spin
very
good
shall
i
bring
the
dog
and
wheel
for
her
she
is
such
a
good
lady
i
wish
to
please
her
very
i
smiled
and
told
him
she
would
not
care
for
the
dog
that
he
was
quite
welcome
to
the
money
and
that
she
refused
to
see
the
priests
from
the
convent
that
morning
because
she
never
received
thanks
for
favors
when
jenny
came
in
i
gave
her
the
fruit
and
laughingly
told
her
that
vivalla
wished
to
show
her
how
his
performing
dog
could
turn
a
poor
man
poor
man
do
let
him
come
it
is
all
the
good
creature
can
do
for
me
exclaimed
jenny
and
the
tears
flowed
thick
and
fast
down
her
cheeks
i
like
that
i
like
that
she
continued
do
let
the
poor
creature
come
and
bring
his
dog
it
will
make
him
so
i
confess
it
made
me
happy
and
i
exclaimed
for
my
heart
was
full
god
bless
you
it
will
make
him
cry
for
joy
he
shall
come
i
saw
vivalla
the
same
evening
and
delighted
him
with
the
intelligence
that
jenny
would
see
his
dog
perform
the
next
day
at
four
o
clock
precisely
i
will
be
punctual
said
vivalla
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
but
i
was
she
would
like
to
see
my
dog
for
full
half
an
hour
before
the
time
appointed
did
jenny
lind
sit
in
her
window
on
the
second
floor
and
watch
for
vivalla
and
his
dog
a
few
minutes
before
the
appointed
hour
she
saw
him
coming
ah
here
he
comes
here
he
comes
she
exclaimed
in
delight
as
she
ran
down
stairs
and
opened
the
door
to
admit
him
a
negro
boy
was
bringing
the
small
while
vivalla
led
the
dog
handing
the
boy
a
silver
coin
she
motioned
him
away
and
taking
the
wheel
in
her
arms
she
said
this
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
with
your
dog
follow
me
i
will
carry
the
wheel
up
her
servant
offered
to
take
the
wheel
but
no
she
would
let
no
one
carry
it
but
herself
she
called
us
all
up
to
her
parlor
and
for
one
full
hour
did
she
devote
herself
to
the
happy
italian
she
went
down
on
her
knees
to
pet
the
dog
and
to
ask
vivalla
all
sorts
of
questions
about
his
performances
his
former
course
of
life
his
friends
in
italy
and
his
present
hopes
and
determinations
then
she
sang
and
played
for
him
gave
him
some
refreshments
finally
insisted
on
carrying
his
wheel
to
the
door
and
her
servant
accompanied
vivalla
to
his
poor
vivalla
he
was
probably
never
so
happy
before
but
his
enjoyment
did
not
exceed
that
of
miss
lind
that
scene
alone
would
have
paid
me
for
all
my
labors
during
the
entire
musical
campaign
a
few
months
later
however
the
havana
correspondent
of
the
york
announced
the
death
of
vivalla
and
stated
that
the
poor
italian
s
last
words
were
about
jenny
lind
and
barnum
when
captain
rawlings
of
the
steamer
isabella
made
his
next
return
trip
from
charleston
he
brought
a
fine
lot
of
game
and
invited
benedict
belletti
and
myself
to
a
breakfast
on
board
where
we
met
john
howard
of
the
irving
house
new
york
j
monnot
of
the
new
york
hotel
mixer
of
the
charleston
hotel
and
monroe
of
one
of
the
havana
hotels
the
breakfast
was
a
very
nice
one
and
was
accompanied
by
some
very
fine
old
madeira
which
received
the
highest
encomiums
of
the
company
now
said
captain
rawlings
you
must
break
your
rule
once
barnum
and
wash
down
your
game
with
a
glass
or
two
of
this
choice
madeira
it
is
very
old
and
fine
as
smooth
as
oil
and
the
game
is
hardly
game
without
it
do
take
i
positively
declined
saying
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
the
genuine
article
for
once
but
that
most
of
what
was
offered
and
sold
as
wine
did
not
contain
a
single
drop
of
the
juice
of
the
grape
this
led
to
a
general
talk
about
the
impositions
practised
even
in
the
best
hotels
in
serving
customers
with
fine
old
wines
and
liquors
at
the
bar
and
at
the
table
and
some
very
curious
and
amusing
stories
were
told
and
confessions
made
but
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
this
madeira
it
was
rich
rare
old
oily
and
genuine
in
flavor
and
quality
all
the
connoisseurs
at
the
table
were
unanimous
in
their
verdict
but
when
the
breakfast
was
over
and
we
were
going
ashore
as
i
was
sitting
next
the
captain
in
his
own
boat
he
said
to
me
barnum
that
fine
old
madeira
is
the
real
game
of
my
game
breakfast
i
wanted
to
test
those
experienced
tasters
and
i
gave
them
some
wine
which
i
bought
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
gallon
at
a
corner
grocery
in
in
the
party
which
accompanied
me
to
havana
was
henry
bennett
who
formerly
kept
peale
s
museum
in
new
york
afterwards
managing
the
same
establishment
for
me
when
i
purchased
it
and
he
was
now
with
me
in
the
capacity
of
a
he
was
as
honest
a
man
as
ever
lived
and
a
good
deal
of
a
wag
i
remember
his
going
through
the
market
once
and
running
across
a
decayed
actor
who
was
reduced
to
tending
a
market
stand
bennett
hailed
him
with
hallo
what
are
you
doing
here
what
are
you
keeping
that
old
turkey
for
o
for
a
profit
replied
the
actor
prophet
prophet
exclaimed
bennett
patriarch
you
mean
with
all
his
waggery
he
was
subject
at
times
to
moods
of
the
deepest
despondency
bordering
on
insanity
madness
ran
in
his
family
his
brother
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
had
blown
his
brains
out
henry
himself
had
twice
attempted
his
own
life
while
in
my
employ
in
new
york
some
time
after
our
present
journey
to
havana
i
sent
him
to
london
he
conducted
my
business
precisely
as
i
directed
writing
up
his
account
with
me
correctly
to
a
penny
then
handing
it
to
a
mutual
friend
with
directions
to
give
it
to
me
when
i
arrived
in
london
the
following
week
he
went
to
his
lodgings
and
committed
suicide
while
we
were
in
havana
bennett
was
so
despondent
at
times
that
we
were
obliged
to
watch
him
illustration
bennett
and
his
carefully
lest
he
should
do
some
damage
to
himself
or
others
when
we
left
havana
for
new
orleans
on
board
the
steamer
falcon
james
gordon
bennett
editor
of
the
york
and
his
wife
were
also
passengers
after
permitting
one
favorable
notice
in
his
paper
bennett
had
turned
around
as
usual
and
had
abused
jenny
lind
and
bitterly
attacked
me
there
was
an
estrangement
no
new
thing
between
the
editor
and
myself
the
in
its
desire
to
excite
attention
has
a
habit
of
attacking
public
men
and
i
had
not
escaped
i
was
always
glad
to
get
such
notices
for
they
served
as
inexpensive
advertisements
to
my
museum
and
brought
custom
to
me
free
of
charge
bennett
however
took
much
to
heart
the
attacks
of
editor
bennett
upon
jenny
lind
and
while
in
new
york
he
threatened
to
cowhide
his
namesake
as
so
many
men
have
actually
done
in
days
gone
by
but
i
restrained
him
when
editor
bennett
came
on
board
the
falcon
he
had
in
his
arms
a
small
pet
monkey
belonging
to
his
wife
and
the
animal
was
placed
in
a
safe
place
on
the
forward
deck
when
henry
bennett
saw
the
editor
he
said
to
a
bystander
i
would
willingly
be
drowned
if
i
could
see
that
old
scoundrel
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
several
of
our
party
overheard
the
remark
and
i
turned
laughingly
to
bennett
and
said
nonsense
he
can
t
harm
any
one
and
there
is
an
old
proverb
about
the
impossibility
of
drowning
those
who
are
born
to
another
that
very
night
however
as
i
stood
near
the
cabin
door
conversing
with
my
treasurer
and
other
members
of
my
company
henry
bennett
came
up
to
me
with
a
wild
air
and
hoarsely
whispered
old
bennett
has
gone
forward
alone
in
the
dark
to
feed
his
monkey
and
d
n
him
i
am
going
to
throw
him
we
were
all
startled
for
we
knew
the
man
and
he
seemed
terribly
in
earnest
knowing
how
most
effectively
to
address
him
at
such
times
i
exclaimed
ridiculous
you
would
not
do
such
a
i
swear
i
will
was
his
savage
reply
i
expostulated
with
him
and
several
of
our
party
joined
me
nobody
will
know
it
muttered
the
maniac
and
i
shall
be
doing
the
world
a
i
endeavored
to
awaken
him
to
a
sense
of
the
crime
he
contemplated
assuring
him
that
it
could
not
possibly
benefit
any
one
and
that
from
the
fact
of
the
relations
existing
between
the
editor
and
myself
i
should
be
the
first
to
be
accused
of
his
murder
i
implored
him
to
go
to
his
stateroom
and
he
finally
did
so
accompanied
by
some
of
the
gentlemen
of
our
party
i
took
pains
to
see
that
he
was
carefully
watched
that
night
and
indeed
for
several
days
till
he
became
calm
again
he
was
a
large
athletic
man
quite
able
to
pick
up
his
namesake
and
drop
him
overboard
the
matter
was
too
serious
for
a
joke
and
we
made
little
mention
of
it
but
more
than
one
of
my
party
said
then
and
has
said
since
what
i
really
believe
to
be
true
that
james
gordon
bennett
would
have
been
drowned
that
night
had
it
not
been
for
this
incident
has
long
been
known
to
several
of
my
intimate
friends
and
when
bennett
learns
the
fact
from
this
volume
he
may
possibly
be
somewhat
mollified
over
his
payment
to
me
fifteen
years
later
of
for
the
unexpired
lease
of
my
museum
concerning
which
some
particulars
will
be
given
anon
in
new
orleans
the
wharf
was
crowded
by
a
great
concourse
of
persons
as
the
steamer
falcon
approached
jenny
lind
had
enjoyed
a
month
of
quiet
and
dreaded
the
excitement
which
she
must
now
again
encounter
mr
barnum
i
am
sure
i
can
never
get
through
that
crowd
said
she
in
despair
leave
that
to
me
remain
quiet
for
ten
minutes
and
there
shall
be
no
crowd
here
i
replied
taking
my
daughter
on
my
arm
she
threw
her
veil
over
her
face
and
we
descended
the
gangway
to
the
dock
the
crowd
pressed
around
i
had
beckoned
for
a
carriage
before
leaving
the
ship
that
s
barnum
i
know
him
called
out
several
persons
at
the
top
of
their
voices
open
the
way
if
you
please
for
barnum
and
miss
lind
cried
le
grand
smith
over
the
railing
of
the
ship
the
deck
of
which
he
had
just
reached
from
the
wharf
don
t
crowd
her
if
you
please
gentlemen
i
exclaimed
and
by
dint
of
pushing
squeezing
and
coaxing
we
reached
the
carriage
and
drove
for
the
montalba
buildings
where
miss
lind
s
apartments
had
been
prepared
and
the
whole
crowd
came
following
at
our
heels
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
jenny
and
her
companion
came
quietly
in
a
carriage
and
were
in
the
house
before
the
ruse
was
discovered
in
answer
to
incessant
calls
she
appeared
a
moment
upon
the
balcony
waved
her
handkerchief
received
three
hearty
cheers
and
the
crowd
dispersed
a
poor
blind
boy
residing
in
the
interior
of
mississippi
a
and
an
ardent
lover
of
music
visited
new
orleans
expressly
to
hear
jenny
lind
a
subscription
had
been
taken
up
among
his
neighbors
to
defray
the
expenses
this
fact
coming
to
the
ears
of
jenny
she
sent
for
him
played
and
sang
for
him
gave
him
many
words
of
joy
and
comfort
took
him
to
her
concerts
and
sent
him
away
considerably
richer
than
he
had
ever
been
before
a
funny
incident
occurred
at
new
orleans
our
concerts
were
given
in
the
charles
theatre
then
managed
by
my
good
friend
the
late
sol
smith
in
the
open
lots
near
the
theatre
were
exhibitions
of
mammoth
hogs
horses
grizzly
bears
and
other
animals
a
gentleman
had
a
son
about
twelve
years
old
who
had
a
wonderful
ear
for
music
he
could
whistle
or
sing
any
tune
after
hearing
it
once
his
father
did
not
know
nor
care
for
a
single
note
but
so
anxious
was
he
to
please
his
son
that
he
paid
thirty
dollars
for
two
tickets
to
the
concert
i
liked
the
music
better
than
i
expected
said
he
to
me
the
next
day
but
my
son
was
in
raptures
he
was
so
perfectly
enchanted
that
he
scarcely
spoke
the
whole
evening
and
i
would
on
no
account
disturb
his
delightful
reveries
when
the
concert
was
finished
we
came
out
of
the
theatre
not
a
word
was
spoken
i
knew
that
my
musical
prodigy
was
happy
among
the
clouds
and
i
said
nothing
i
could
not
help
envying
him
his
love
of
music
and
considered
my
thirty
dollars
as
nothing
compared
to
the
bliss
which
it
secured
to
him
indeed
i
was
seriously
thinking
of
taking
him
to
the
next
concert
when
he
spoke
we
were
just
passing
the
numerous
shows
upon
the
vacant
lots
one
of
the
signs
attracted
him
and
he
said
father
let
us
go
in
and
see
the
big
hog
the
little
scamp
i
could
have
him
said
the
father
who
loving
a
joke
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ludicrous
incident
some
months
afterwards
i
was
relating
this
story
at
my
own
table
to
several
guests
among
whom
was
a
very
man
who
had
not
the
faintest
conception
of
humor
after
the
whole
party
had
laughed
heartily
at
the
anecdote
my
friend
gravely
asked
and
was
it
a
very
large
hog
barnum
i
made
arrangements
with
the
captain
of
the
splendid
steamer
magnolia
of
louisville
to
take
our
party
as
far
as
cairo
the
junction
of
the
mississippi
and
ohio
rivers
stipulating
for
sufficient
delay
in
natchez
mississippi
and
in
memphis
tennessee
to
give
a
concert
in
each
place
it
was
no
unusual
thing
for
me
to
charter
a
steamboat
or
a
special
train
of
cars
for
our
party
with
such
an
enterprise
as
that
time
and
comfort
were
paramount
to
money
the
time
on
board
the
steamer
was
whiled
away
in
reading
viewing
the
scenery
of
the
mississippi
and
other
diversions
one
day
we
had
a
pleasant
musical
festival
in
the
ladies
saloon
for
the
gratification
of
the
passengers
at
which
jenny
volunteered
to
sing
without
ceremony
it
seemed
to
us
she
never
sang
so
sweetly
before
i
also
did
my
best
to
amuse
my
fellow
passengers
with
anecdotes
and
the
exhibition
of
sundry
legerdemain
tricks
which
i
had
been
obliged
to
learn
and
use
in
the
south
years
before
and
under
far
different
circumstances
than
those
which
attended
the
performance
now
among
other
tricks
i
caused
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
to
disappear
so
mysteriously
from
beneath
a
card
that
the
mulatto
barber
on
board
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
in
league
with
the
devil
the
next
morning
i
seated
myself
for
the
operation
of
shaving
and
the
colored
gentleman
ventured
to
dip
into
the
mystery
beg
pardon
barnum
but
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
and
i
saw
more
than
i
wanted
to
see
last
night
is
it
true
that
you
have
sold
yourself
to
the
devil
so
that
you
can
do
what
you
ve
a
mind
to
oh
yes
was
my
reply
that
is
the
bargain
between
how
long
did
you
agree
for
was
the
question
next
in
order
only
nine
years
said
i
i
have
had
three
of
them
already
before
the
other
six
are
out
i
shall
find
a
way
to
nonplus
the
old
gentleman
and
i
have
told
him
so
to
his
at
this
avowal
a
larger
space
of
white
than
usual
was
seen
in
the
darkey
s
eyes
and
he
inquired
is
it
by
this
bargain
that
you
get
so
much
money
certainly
no
matter
who
has
money
nor
where
he
keeps
it
in
his
box
or
till
or
anywhere
about
him
i
have
only
to
speak
the
words
and
it
the
shaving
was
completed
in
silence
but
thought
had
been
busy
in
the
barber
s
mind
and
he
embraced
the
speediest
opportunity
to
transfer
his
bag
of
coin
to
the
iron
safe
in
charge
of
the
clerk
the
movement
did
not
escape
me
and
immediately
a
joke
was
afoot
i
had
barely
time
to
make
two
or
three
details
of
arrangement
with
the
clerk
and
resume
my
seat
in
the
cabin
ere
the
barber
sought
a
second
interview
bent
on
testing
the
alleged
powers
of
beelzebub
s
colleague
beg
pardon
barnum
but
where
is
my
money
can
you
get
it
i
do
not
want
your
money
was
the
quiet
answer
it
is
yes
i
know
it
is
safe
ha
ha
it
is
in
the
iron
safe
in
the
clerk
s
office
safe
enough
from
you
it
is
not
in
the
iron
safe
said
i
this
was
said
so
quietly
yet
positively
that
the
colored
gentleman
ran
to
the
office
and
inquired
if
all
was
safe
all
right
said
the
clerk
open
and
let
me
see
replied
the
barber
the
safe
was
unlocked
and
lo
the
money
was
gone
in
mystified

according

the
magnolia
waited
for
us
at
natchez
and
memphis
and
we
gave
profitable
concerts
at
both
places
the
concert
at
memphis
was
the
sixtieth
in
the
list
since
miss
lind
s
arrival
in
america
and
the
first
concert
in
louis
would
be
the
when
we
reached
that
city
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
our
first
concert
was
to
be
given
miss
lind
s
secretary
came
to
me
commissioned
he
said
by
her
and
announced
that
as
sixty
concerts
had
already
taken
place
she
proposed
to
avail
herself
of
one
of
the
conditions
of
our
contract
and
cancel
the
engagement
next
morning
as
this
was
the
first
intimation
of
the
kind
i
had
received
i
was
somewhat
startled
though
i
assumed
an
entirely
placid
demeanor
and
asked
does
miss
lind
authorize
you
to
give
me
this
notice
i
so
understand
it
was
the
reply
i
immediately
reflected
that
if
our
contract
was
thus
suddenly
cancelled
miss
lind
was
bound
to
repay
to
me
all
i
had
paid
her
over
the
stipulated
for
each
concert
and
a
little
calculation
showed
that
the
sum
thus
to
be
paid
back
was
since
she
had
already
received
from
me
for
sixty
concerts
in
this
view
i
could
not
but
think
that
this
was
a
ruse
of
some
of
her
advisers
and
possibly
that
she
might
know
nothing
of
the
matter
so
i
told
her
secretary
that
i
would
see
him
again
in
an
hour
and
meanwhile
i
went
to
my
old
friend
sol
smith
for
his
legal
and
friendly
advice
i
showed
him
my
contract
and
told
him
how
much
i
had
been
annoyed
by
the
selfish
and
greedy
and
advisers
legal
and
otherwise
of
jenny
lind
i
talked
to
him
about
the
wheels
within
wheels
which
moved
this
great
musical
enterprise
and
asked
and
gladly
accepted
his
advice
which
mainly
coincided
with
my
own
views
of
the
situation
i
then
went
back
to
the
secretary
and
quietly
told
him
that
i
was
ready
to
settle
with
miss
lind
and
to
close
the
engagement
but
said
he
manifestly
taken
aback
you
have
already
advertised
concerts
in
louisville
and
cincinnati
i
yes
i
replied
but
you
may
take
my
contracts
for
halls
and
printing
off
my
hands
at
i
further
said
that
he
was
welcome
to
the
assistance
of
my
agent
who
had
made
these
arrangements
and
moreover
that
i
would
cheerfully
give
my
own
services
to
help
them
through
with
these
concerts
thus
giving
them
a
good
start
on
their
own
my
liberality
which
he
acknowledged
emboldened
him
to
make
an
extraordinary
proposition
now
suppose
he
asked
miss
lind
should
wish
to
give
some
fifty
concerts
in
this
country
what
would
you
charge
as
manager
per
concert
a
million
dollars
each
not
one
cent
less
i
replied
i
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
the
whole
thing
was
as
clear
as
daylight
and
i
continued
now
we
might
as
well
understand
each
other
i
don
t
believe
miss
lind
has
authorized
you
to
propose
to
me
to
cancel
our
contract
but
if
she
has
just
bring
me
a
line
to
that
effect
over
her
signature
and
her
check
for
the
amount
due
me
by
the
terms
of
that
contract
some
and
we
will
close
our
business
connections
at
but
why
not
make
a
new
arrangement
persisted
the
secretary
for
fifty
concerts
more
by
which
miss
lind
shall
pay
you
liberally
say
per
concert
simply
because
i
hired
miss
lind
and
not
she
me
i
replied
and
because
i
never
ought
to
take
a
farthing
less
for
my
risk
and
trouble
than
the
contract
gives
me
i
have
voluntarily
paid
miss
lind
more
than
twice
as
much
as
i
originally
contracted
to
pay
her
or
as
she
expected
to
receive
when
she
first
engaged
with
me
now
if
she
is
not
satisfied
i
wish
to
settle
instantly
and
finally
if
you
do
not
bring
me
her
decision
i
shall
go
to
her
for
it
i
met
the
secretary
soon
after
breakfast
next
morning
and
asked
him
if
he
had
a
written
communication
for
me
from
miss
lind
he
said
he
had
not
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
he
merely
wanted
he
added
to
see
what
i
would
say
to
the
proposition
i
asked
him
if
miss
lind
was
in
the
joke
as
he
called
it
he
hoped
i
would
not
inquire
but
would
let
the
matter
drop
i
went
on
as
usual
and
gave
four
more
concerts
in
louis
and
followed
out
my
programme
as
arranged
in
other
cities
for
many
weeks
following
nor
at
that
time
nor
at
any
time
afterwards
did
miss
lind
give
me
the
slightest
intimation
that
she
had
any
knowledge
of
the
proposition
of
her
secretary
to
cancel
our
agreement
or
to
employ
me
as
her
manager
during
our
stay
at
louis
i
delivered
a
temperance
lecture
in
the
theatre
and
at
the
close
among
other
signers
of
the
pledge
was
my
friend
and
adviser
sol
smith
uncle
sol
as
every
one
called
him
was
a
famous
character
in
his
time
he
was
an
excellent
comedian
an
author
a
manager
and
a
lawyer
for
a
considerable
period
of
his
life
he
was
largely
concerned
in
theatricals
in
louis
new
orleans
and
other
cities
and
acquired
a
handsome
property
he
died
at
a
ripe
old
age
in
respected
and
lamented
by
all
who
knew
him
i
esteem
it
an
honor
to
have
been
one
of
his
intimate
friends
a
year
or
two
before
he
died
he
published
a
very
interesting
volume
giving
a
full
account
of
the
leading
incidents
in
his
long
and
varied
career
as
an
actor
and
manager
he
had
previously
in
published
an
autobiographical
work
comprising
an
account
of
the
second
seven
years
of
his
professional
life
together
with
sketches
of
adventure
in
after
years
and
entitled
the
theatrical
and
anecdotical
recollections
of
sol
smith
comedian
attorney
at
law
etc
this
unique
work
was
preceded
by
a
dedication
which
i
venture
to
copy
it
was
as
follows
to
phineas
barnum
proprietor
of
the
american
museum
etc
whilst
you
were
engaged
in
your
grand
jenny
lind
speculation
the
following
conundrum
went
the
rounds
of
the
american
newspapers
why
is
it
that
jenny
lind
and
barnum
will
never
fall
out
answer
because
he
is
always
and
she
is
always
i
have
never
asked
you
the
question
directly
whether
you
barnum
started
that
conundrum
or
not
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
you
did
at
all
events
i
noticed
that
your
whole
policy
was
concentrated
into
one
idea
to
make
an
angel
of
jenny
and
depreciate
yourself
in
contrast
you
may
remember
that
in
this
city
louis
i
acted
in
one
instance
as
your
legal
adviser
and
as
such
necessarily
became
acquainted
with
all
the
particulars
of
your
contract
with
the
swedish
nightingale
as
well
as
the
various
modifications
claimed
by
that
charitable
lady
and
submitted
to
by
you
after
her
arrival
in
this
country
which
modifications
i
suppose
it
need
no
longer
be
a
secret
secured
to
her
besides
the
original
stipulation
of
one
thousand
dollars
for
every
concert
attendants
carriages
assistant
artists
and
a
pompous
and
extravagant
retinue
fit
only
for
a
european
princess
one
half
of
the
profits
of
each
performance
you
may
also
remember
the
legal
advice
i
gave
you
on
the
occasion
referred
to
and
the
salutary
effect
of
your
following
it
you
must
remember
the
extravagant
joy
you
felt
afterwards
in
philadelphia
when
the
angel
made
up
her
mind
to
avail
herself
of
one
of
the
stipulations
in
her
contract
to
break
off
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
nights
and
even
bought
out
seven
of
that
hundred
supposing
that
she
could
go
on
without
your
aid
as
well
as
with
it
and
you
can
not
but
remember
how
like
a
she
dropped
when
your
business
connection
with
her
ended
and
how
she
fizzed
out
the
remainder
of
her
concert
nights
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
soon
afterwards
retired
to
her
domestic
blissitude
in
sweden
you
know
barnum
if
you
would
only
tell
which
of
the
two
it
was
that
was
and
which
and
you
also
know
who
actually
gave
the
larger
portion
of
those
sums
which
you
heralded
to
the
world
as
the
sole
gifts
of
the
divine
of
all
your
speculations
from
the
negro
centenarina
who
didn
t
nurse
general
washington
down
to
the
bearded
woman
of
genoa
there
was
not
one
which
required
the
exercise
of
so
much
humbuggery
as
the
jenny
lind
concerts
and
i
verily
believe
there
is
no
man
living
other
than
yourself
who
could
or
would
have
risked
the
enormous
expenditure
of
money
necessary
to
carry
them
through
successfully
travelling
with
sixty
artists
four
thousand
miles
and
giving
concerts
at
an
actual
cost
of
hundred
dollars
each
is
what
no
other
man
would
have
undertaken
you
accomplished
this
and
pocketed
by
the
operation
but
little
less
than
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
barnum
you
are
yourself
alone
i
honor
you
oh
great
impressario
as
the
most
successful
manager
in
america
or
any
other
country
democrat
as
you
are
you
can
give
a
practical
lesson
to
the
aristocrats
of
europe
how
to
live
at
your
beautiful
and
tasteful
residence

i
don
t
like
the
name
though
you
can
and
do
entertain
your
friends
with
a
warmth
of
hospitality
only
equalled
by
that
of
the
great
landed
proprietors
of
the
old
country
or
of
our
own
sunny
whilst
riches
are
pouring
into
your
coffers
from
your
various
ventures
in

of

you
do
not
hoard
your

them
forth
upon

encouraging
the

in

all
this
you

whenever

should

the
thanks

in

as

owe
you

with
the
hope
of
affording
you
an
hour

amusement
if
you
can
spare
that
amount
of
time
from
your
numerous
avocations
to
read
it
i
present
you
with
this
little
volume
containing
a
very
brief
account
of
some
of
my
in
the
south
and
west
and
remain
very
respectfully
your
friend
and
affectionate
uncle
sol
smith
hang
chouteau
avenue
louis
nov
uncle
sol
smith
must
be
held
solely
responsible
for
his
extravagant
estimate
of
barnum
and
for
his
somewhat
deprecatory
view
of
the
attributes
of
the
divine
it
is
true
that
he
derived
many
of
his
impressions
of
miss
lind
from
the
annoying
circumstances
that
compelled
me
to
seek
his
professional
advice
and
assistance
in
louis
when
jenny
lind
s
secretary
came
to
me
with
an
assumed
authorization
from
her
to
abruptly
close
our
engagement
but
when
sol
smith
s
dedication
was
first
published
there
were
plenty
of
people
and
papers
throughout
the
land
that
were
eager
to
catch
up
and
indorse
this
new
view
of
miss
lind
s
character
the
athenians
were
sometimes
sick
no
doubt
of
hearing
aristides
always
called
the
yet
some
of
the
sharp
things
which
sol
smith
means
to
say
about
miss
lind
apply
rather
to
the
selfish
persons
who
unfortunately
were
more
in
her
confidence
than
i
ever
aspired
to
be
and
who
assumed
to
advise
her
and
thus
easily
perverted
her
better
judgment
with
all
her
excellent
and
even
extraordinarily
good
qualities
however
jenny
lind
was
human
though
the
reputation
she
bore
in
europe
for
her
many
charitable
acts
led
me
to
believe
till
i
knew
her
that
she
was
nearly
perfect
i
think
now
that
her
natural
impulses
were
more
simple
childlike
pure
and
generous
than
those
of
almost
any
other
person
i
ever
met
but
she
had
been
petted
almost
worshipped
so
long
that
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
her
unbounded
popularity
had
not
in
some
degree
affected
her
to
her
hurt
and
it
must
not
be
thought
extraordinary
if
she
now
and
then
exhibited
some
phase
of
human
weakness
like
most
persons
of
uncommon
talent
she
had
a
strong
will
which
at
times
she
found
ungovernable
but
if
she
was
ever
betrayed
into
a
display
of
she
was
sure
to
apologize
and
express
her
regret
afterwards
le
grand
smith
who
was
quite
intimate
with
her
and
who
was
my
man
during
the
entire
lind
engagement
used
sometimes
to
say
to
me
well
barnum
you
have
managed
wonderfully
in
always
keeping
jenny
s
angel
side
outside
with
the
more
than
one
englishman
i
may
instance
dolby
dickens
s
agent
during
his
last
visit
to
america
expressed
surprise
at
the
confirmed
impression
of
perfection
entertained
by
the
general
american
public
in
regard
to
the
swedish
nightingale
these
things
are
written
with
none
but
the
kindest
feelings
towards
the
sweet
songstress
and
only
to
modify
the
too
current
ideas
of
superhuman
excellence
which
can
not
be
characteristic
of
any
mortal
being
as
i
have
before
intimated
in
giving
details
of
my
management
of
the
enterprise
believing
as
i
did
when
i
engaged
her
in
her
angelic
reputation
i
am
frank
enough
to
confess
that
i
considered
her
private
character
a
valuable
adjunct
even
in
a
business
point
of
view
to
her
renown
as
a
singer
i
admit
that
i
took
her
charities
into
account
as
part
of
my
stock
in
whenever
she
sang
for
a
public
or
private
charity
she
gave
her
voice
which
was
worth
a
thousand
dollars
to
her
every
evening
at
such
times
i
always
insisted
upon
paying
for
the
hall
orchestra
printing
and
other
expenses
because
i
felt
able
and
willing
to
contribute
my
full
share
towards
the
worthy
objects
which
prompted
these
benefits
this
narration
would
be
incomplete
if
i
did
not
add
the
following
we
were
in
havana
when
i
showed
to
miss
lind
a
paper
containing
the
conundrum
on
and
at
which
she
laughed
heartily
but
immediately
checked
herself
and
said
o
barnum
this
is
not
fair
you
know
that
you
really
give
more
than
i
do
from
the
proceeds
of
every
one
of
these
charity
and
it
is
but
just
to
her
to
say
that
she
frequently
remonstrated
with
me
and
declared
that
the
actual
expenses
should
be
deducted
and
the
thus
lessened
sum
devoted
to
the
charity
for
which
the
concert
might
be
given
but
i
always
laughingly
told
her
that
i
must
do
my
part
give
my
share
and
that
if
it
was
purely
a
business
operation
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
it
would
return
perhaps
buttered
for
the
larger
her
reputation
for
liberality
the
more
liberal
the
public
would
surely
be
to
us
and
to
our
enterprise
i
have
no
wish
to
conceal
these
facts
and
i
certainly
have
no
desire
to
receive
a
larger
meed
of
praise
than
my
qualified
generosity
merits
justice
to
myself
and
to
my
management
as
well
as
to
miss
lind
seems
to
permit

not

statement
of
the
total
receipts
of
the
concerts
after
five
concerts
in
louis
we
went
to
nashville
tennessee
where
we
gave
our
and
concerts
in
this
country
at
the
first
ticket
auction
in
that
city
the
excitement
was
considerable
and
the
bidding
spirited
as
was
generally
the
case
after
the
auction
was
over
one
of
my
men
happening
in
at
a
store
in
the
town
heard
the
proprietor
say
i
ll
give
five
dollars
to
any
man
who
will
take
me
out
and
give
me
a
good
i
deserve
it
and
am
willing
to
pay
for
having
it
done
to
think
that
i
should
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
have
paid
dollars
for
four
tickets
for
my
wife
two
daughters
and
myself
to
listen
to
music
for
only
two
hours
makes
me
mad
with
myself
and
i
want
to
pay
somebody
for
giving
me
a
thundering
good
i
am
not
sure
that
others
have
not
experienced
a
somewhat
similar
feeling
when
they
became
cool
and
rational
and
the
excitement
of
novelty
and
competition
had
passed
away
while
at
nashville
jenny
lind
accompanied
by
my
daughter
lyman
and
myself
visited
the
hermitage
the
late
residence
of
general
jackson
on
that
occasion
for
the
first
time
that
season
we
heard
the
wild
singing
in
the
trees
this
gave
jenny
lind
great
delight
as
she
had
never
before
heard
them
sing
except
in
their
cages
the
first
of
april
occurred
while
we
were
in
nashville
i
was
considerably
annoyed
during
the
forenoon
by
the
calls
of
members
of
the
company
who
came
to
me
under
the
belief
that
i
had
sent
for
them
after
dinner
i
concluded
to
give
them
all
a
touch
of
april
the
following
article
which
appeared
the
next
morning
in
the
nashville
my
amanuensis
having
imparted
the
secret
to
the
editor
will
show
how
it
was
done
a
series
of
laughable
jokes
came
off
yesterday
at
the
veranda
in
honor
of
all
fools
day
barnum
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
mischief
he
managed
in
some
mysterious
manner
to
obtain
a
lot
of
blank
telegraphic
despatches
and
envelopes
from
one
of
the
offices
in
this
city
and
then
went
to
work
and
manufactured
astounding
intelligence
for
most
of
the
parties
composing
the
jenny
lind
suite
almost
every
person
in
the
company
received
a
telegraphic
despatch
written
under
the
direction
of
barnum
barnum
s
daughter
was
informed
that
her
mother
her
cousin
and
several
other
relatives
were
waiting
for
her
in
louisville
and
various
other
important
and
extraordinary
items
of
domestic
intelligence
were
communicated
to
her
mr
le
grand
smith
was
told
by
a
despatch
from
his
father
that
his
native
village
in
connecticut
was
in
ashes
including
his
own
homestead
etc
several
of
barnum
s
employees
had
most
liberal
offers
of
engagements
from
banks
and
other
institutions
at
the
north
burke
and
others
of
the
musical
professors
were
offered
princely
salaries
by
opera
managers
and
many
of
them
received
most
tempting
inducements
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
world
s
fair
in
london
one
married
gentleman
in
barnum
s
suite
received
the
gratifying
intelligence
that
he
had
for
two
days
been
the
father
of
a
pair
of
bouncing
boys
mother
and
children
doing
well
an
event
which
he
had
been
anxiously
looking
for
during
the
week
though
on
a
somewhat
more
limited
scale
in
fact
nearly
every
person
in
the
party
engaged
by
barnum
received
some
extraordinary
telegraphic
intelligence
and
as
the
great
impressario
managed
to
have
the
despatches
delivered
simultaneously
each
recipient
was
for
some
time
busily
occupied
with
his
own
personal
news
by
and
by
each
began
to
tell
his
neighbor
his
good
or
bad
tidings
and
each
was
of
course
rejoiced
or
grieved
according
to
circumstances
several
gave
barnum
notice
of
their
intention
to
leave
him
in
consequence
of
better
offers
and
a
number
of
them
sent
off
telegraphic
despatches
and
letters
by
mail
in
answer
to
those
received
the
man
who
had
so
suddenly
become
the
father
of
twins
telegraphed
to
his
wife
to
be
of
good
cheer
and
that
he
would
start
for
home
at
a
late
hour
last
night
the
secret
had
not
got
out
and
we
presume
that
many
of
the
victims
will
first
learn
from
our
columns
that
they
have
been
taken
in
by
barnum
and
all
fools
day
from
nashville
jenny
lind
and
a
few
friends
went
by
way
of
the
mammoth
cave
to
louisville
while
the
rest
of
the
party
proceeded
by
steamboat
while
in
havana
i
engaged
signor
salvi
for
a
few
months
to
begin
about
the
of
april
he
joined
us
at
louisville
and
sang
in
the
three
concerts
there
with
great
satisfaction
to
the
public
george
prentice
of
the
louisville
and
his
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
who
had
contributed
much
to
the
pleasure
of
miss
lind
and
our
party
accompanied
us
to
cincinnati
a
citizen
of
madison
had
applied
to
me
on
our
first
arrival
in
louisville
for
a
concert
in
that
place
i
replied
that
the
town
was
too
small
to
afford
it
whereupon
he
offered
to
take
the
management
of
it
into
his
own
hands
and
pay
me
for
the
receipts
the
last
concert
at
louisville
and
the
concerts
at
natchez
and
wheeling
were
given
under
a
similar
agreement
though
with
better
pecuniary
results
than
at
madison
as
the
steamer
from
louisville
to
cincinnati
would
arrive
at
madison
about
sundown
and
would
wait
long
enough
for
us
to
give
a
concert
i
agreed
to
his
proposition
we
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
learn
upon
arriving
that
the
concert
must
be
given
in
a
pork
house
a
capacious
shed
which
had
been
fitted
up
and
decorated
for
the
occasion
we
concluded
however
that
if
the
inhabitants
were
satisfied
with
the
accommodations
we
ought
not
to
object
the
person
who
had
contracted
for
the
concert
came
short
of
his
agreement
which
i
consequently
lost
and
at
ten
o
clock
we
were
again
on
board
the
fine
steamer
ben
franklin
bound
for
cincinnati
the
next
morning
the
crowd
upon
the
wharf
was
immense
i
was
fearful
that
an
attempt
to
repeat
the
new
orleans
ruse
with
my
daughter
would
be
of
no
avail
as
the
joke
had
been
published
in
the
cincinnati
papers
so
i
gave
my
arm
to
miss
lind
and
begged
her
to
have
no
fears
for
i
had
hit
upon
an
expedient
which
would
save
her
from
annoyance
we
then
descended
the
plank
to
the
shore
and
as
soon
as
we
had
touched
it
le
grand
smith
called
out
from
the
boat
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
passengers
that
s
no
go
barnum
you
can
t
pass
your
daughter
off
for
jenny
lind
this
the
remark
elicited
a
peal
of
merriment
from
the
crowd
several
persons
calling
out
that
won
t
do
barnum
you
may
fool
the
new
orleans
folks
but
you
can
t
come
it
over
the
we
intend
to
stay
here
until
you
bring
out
jenny
lind
they
readily
allowed
me
to
pass
with
the
lady
whom
they
supposed
to
be
my
daughter
and
in
five
minutes
afterwards
the
nightingale
was
complimenting
coleman
upon
the
beautiful
and
commodious
apartments
which
were
devoted
to
her
in
the
burnett
house
the
crowd
remained
an
hour
on
the
wharf
before
they
would
be
convinced
that
the
person
whom
they
took
for
my
daughter
was
in
fact
the
veritable
swede
when
this
was
discovered
a
general
laugh
followed
the
exclamation
from
one
of
the
victims
well
barnum
has
humbugged
us
after
all
in
passing
up
the
river
to
pittsburg
the
boat
waited
four
hours
to
enable
us
to
give
a
concert
in
wheeling
it
was
managed
by
a
couple
of
gentlemen
in
that
city
who
purchased
it
for
five
thousand
dollars
in
advance
by
which
they
made
a
handsome
profit
for
their
trouble
the
concert
was
given
in
a
church
at
pittsburg
the
open
space
surrounding
the
concert
room
became
crowded
with
thousands
of
persons
who
foolishly
refusing
to
accommodate
each
other
by
listening
to
the
music
disturbed
the
concert
and
determined
us
to
leave
the
next
morning
for
baltimore
instead
of
giving
a
second
concert
that
had
been
advertised
le
grand
smith
here
paid
me
off
for
my
april
fool
joke
he
induced
a
female
of
his
acquaintance
to
call
on
me
and
reveal
an
arrangement
which
she
pretended
accidentally
to
have
overheard
between
some
scoundrels
who
were
resolved
to
stop
our
stage
coach
on
the
alleghany
mountains
and
commit
highway
robbery
the
story
seemed
incredible
and
yet
the
woman
related
it
with
so
much
apparent
sincerity
that
i
swallowed
the
bait
and
remitting
to
new
york
all
the
money
i
had
except
barely
enough
to
defray
our
expenses
to
baltimore
i
purchased
several
revolvers
for
such
members
of
the
company
as
were
not
already
provided
and
we
left
pittsburg
armed
to
the
teeth
fortunately
jenny
lind
and
several
of
the
company
had
left
before
i
made
this
grand
discovery
and
hence
she
was
saved
any
apprehensions
on
the
subject
it
is
needless
to
say
we
found
no
use
for
our
firearms
we
reached
new
york
early
in
may
and
gave
fourteen
concerts
in
castle
garden
and
metropolitan
hall
the
last
of
these
made
the
regular
concert
under
our
engagement
jenny
lind
had
now
again
reached
the
atmosphere
of
her
legal
and
other
advisers
and
i
soon
discovered
the
effects
of
their
influence
i
however
cared
little
what
course
they
advised
her
to
pursue
i
indeed
wished
they
would
prevail
upon
her
to
close
with
her
hundredth
concert
for
i
had
become
weary
with
constant
excitement
and
unremitting
exertions
i
was
confident
that
if
she
undertook
to
give
concerts
on
her
own
account
she
would
be
imposed
upon
and
harassed
in
a
thousand
ways
yet
i
felt
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
have
a
trial
at
it
if
she
saw
fit
to
credit
her
advisers
assurance
that
i
had
not
managed
the
enterprise
as
successfully
as
it
might
have
been
done
at
about
the
concert
therefore
i
was
most
happy
to
learn
from
her
lips
that
she
had
concluded
to
pay
the
forfeiture
of
thousand
dollars
and
terminate
the
concerts
with
the
one
hundredth
we
went
to
philadelphia
where
i
had
advertised
the
and
concerts
and
had
engaged
the
large
national
theatre
on
chestnut
street
it
had
been
used
for
equestrian
and
theatrical
entertainments
but
was
now
thoroughly
cleansed
and
fitted
up
by
max
maretzek
for
italian
opera
it
was
a
convenient
place
for
our
purpose
one
of
her
advisers
a
subordinate
in
her
employ
who
was
already
itching
for
the
position
of
manager
made
the
selection
of
this
building
a
pretext
for
creating
dissatisfaction
in
the
mind
of
miss
lind
i
saw
the
influences
which
were
at
work
and
not
caring
enough
for
the
profits
of
the
remaining
seven
concerts
to
continue
the
engagement
at
the
risk
of
disturbing
the
friendly
feelings
which
had
hitherto
uninterruptedly
existed
between
that
lady
and
myself
i
wrote
her
a
letter
offering
to
relinquish
the
engagement
if
she
desired
it
at
the
termination
of
the
concert
which
was
to
take
place
that
evening
upon
her
simply
allowing
me
a
thousand
dollars
per
concert
for
the
seven
which
would
yet
remain
to
make
up
the
hundred
besides
paying
me
the
sum
stipulated
as
a
forfeiture
for
closing
the
engagement
at
the
concert
towards
evening
i
received
the
following
reply
to
barnum
esq
my
dear
sir
i
accept
your
proposition
to
close
our
contract
at
the
end
of
the
concert
on
condition
of
my
paying
you
seven
thousand
dollars
in
addition
to
the
sum
i
forfeit
under
the
condition
of
finishing
the
engagement
at
the
end
of
one
hundred
concerts
i
am
dear
sir
yours
truly
jenny
lind
philadelphia
of
june
i
met
her
at
the
concert
in
the
evening
and
she
was
polite
and
friendly
as
ever
between
the
first
and
second
parts
of
the
concert
i
introduced
general
welch
the
lessee
of
the
national
theatre
who
informed
her
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
release
me
from
my
engagement
of
the
building
if
she
did
not
desire
it
longer
she
replied
that
upon
trial
she
found
it
much
better
than
she
expected
and
she
would
therefore
retain
it
for
the
remainder
of
the
concerts
in
the
mean
time
her
advisers
had
been
circulating
the
story
that
i
had
compelled
her
to
sing
in
an
improper
place
and
when
they
heard
she
had
concluded
to
remain
there
they
beset
her
with
arguments
against
it
until
at
last
she
consented
to
remove
her
concerts
to
a
smaller
hall
i
had
thoroughly
advertised
the
three
concerts
in
the
newspapers
within
a
radius
of
one
hundred
miles
from
philadelphia
and
had
sent
admission
tickets
to
the
editors
on
the
day
of
the
second
concert
one
of
the
new
agents
who
had
indirectly
aided
in
bringing
about
the
dissolution
of
our
engagement
refused
to
recognize
these
tickets
i
urged
upon
him
the
injustice
of
such
a
course
but
received
no
satisfaction
i
then
stated
the
fact
to
miss
lind
and
she
gave
immediate
orders
that
these
tickets
should
be
received
country
editors
tickets
which
were
offered
after
i
left
philadelphia
were
however
refused
by
her
agents
contrary
to
miss
lind
s
wish
and
knowledge
and
the
editors
having
come
from
a
distance
with
their
wives
purchased
tickets
and
i
subsequently
remitted
the
money
to
numerous
gentlemen
whose
complimentary
tickets
were
thus
repudiated
jenny
lind
gave
several
concerts
with
varied
success
and
then
retired
to
niagara
falls
and
afterwards
to
northampton
massachusetts
while
sojourning
at
the
latter
place
she
visited
boston
and
was
married
to
otto
goldschmidt
a
german
composer
and
pianist
to
whom
she
was
much
attached
and
who
had
studied
music
with
her
in
germany
he
played
several
times
in
our
concerts
he
was
a
very
quiet
inoffensive
gentleman
and
an
accomplished
musician
i
met
her
several
times
after
our
engagement
terminated
she
was
always
affable
on
one
occasion
while
passing
through
bridgeport
she
told
me
that
she
had
been
sadly
harassed
in
giving
her
concerts
people
cheat
me
and
swindle
me
very
much
said
she
and
i
find
it
very
annoying
to
give
concerts
on
my
own
i
was
always
supplied
with
complimentary
tickets
when
she
gave
concerts
in
new
york
and
on
the
occasion
of
her
last
appearance
in
america
i
visited
her
in
her
room
back
of
the
stage
and
bade
her
and
her
husband
adieu
with
my
best
wishes
she
expressed
the
same
feeling
to
me
in
return
she
told
me
she
should
never
sing
much
if
any
more
in
public
but
i
reminded
her
that
a
good
providence
had
endowed
her
with
a
voice
which
enabled
her
to
contribute
in
an
eminent
degree
to
the
enjoyment
of
her
fellow
beings
and
if
she
no
longer
needed
the
large
sums
of
money
which
they
were
willing
to
pay
for
this
elevating
and
delightful
entertainment
she
knew
by
experience
what
a
genuine
pleasure
she
would
receive
by
devoting
the
money
to
the
alleviation
of
the
wants
and
sorrows
of
those
who
needed
it
ah
barnum
she
replied
that
is
very
true
and
it
would
be
ungrateful
in
me
to
not
continue
to
use
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
and
lowly
that
gift
which
our
kind
heavenly
father
has
so
graciously
bestowed
upon
me
yes
i
will
continue
to
sing
so
long
as
my
voice
lasts
but
it
will
be
mostly
for
charitable
objects
for
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
have
all
the
money
which
i
shall
ever
pursuant
to
this
resolution
the
larger
portion
of
the
concerts
which
this
noble
lady
has
given
since
her
return
to
europe
have
been
for
objects
of
benevolence
if
she
consents
to
sing
for
a
charitable
object
in
london
for

in

we
chartered
the
ship
regatta
captain
pratt
and
despatched
her
together
with
our
agents
june
and
nutter
to
ceylon
the
ship
left
new
york
in
may
and
was
absent
one
year
their
mission
was
to
procure
either
by
capture
or
purchase
twelve
or
more
living
elephants
besides
such
other
wild
animals
as
they
could
secure
in
order
to
provide
sufficient
drink
and
provender
for
a
cargo
of
these
huge
animals
we
purchased
a
large
quantity
of
hay
in
new
york
five
hundred
tons
were
left
at
the
island
of
helena
to
be
taken
on

trip
of
the
ship
and
staves
and
hoops
of
were
also
left
at

were
unable
to
purchase
the
required
number
of
elephants
either
in
columbo
or
kandy
the
principal
towns
of
the
island
ceylon
they
took
one
hundred
and
sixty
native
assistants
and
plunged
into
the
jungles
where
after
many
most
exciting
adventures
they
succeeded
in
securing
thirteen
elephants
of
a
suitable
size
for
their
purpose
with
a
female
and
her
calf
or
baby
elephant
only
six
months
old
in
the
course
of
the
expedition
nutter
and
june
killed
large
numbers
of
the
huge
beasts
and
had
numerous
encounters
of
the
most
terrific
description
with
the
formidable
animals
one
of
the
most
fearful
of
which
took
place
near
anarajah
poora
while
they
were
endeavoring
by
the
aid
of
the
natives
and
trained
elephants
to
drive
the
wild
herd
of
beasts
into
an
indian
kraal
they
arrived
in
new
york
in
with
ten
of
the
elephants
and
these
harnessed
in
pairs
to
a
chariot
paraded
up
broadway
past
the
irving
house
while
jenny
lind
was
staying
at
that
hotel
on
the
occasion
of
her
second
visit
to
new
york
nutter
and
june
also
brought
with
the
elephants
a
native
who
was
competent
to
manage
and
control
them
we
added
a
caravan
of
wild
animals
and
many
museum
curiosities
the
entire
outfit
including
horses
vans
carriages
tent
costing
and
commenced
operations
with
the
presence
and
under
the
patronage
of
general
tom
thumb
who
travelled
nearly
four
years
as
one
of
the
attractions
of
barnum
s
great
asiatic
caravan
museum
and
menagerie
returning
us
immense
profits
at
the
end
of
that
time
after
exhibiting
in
all
sections
of
the
country
we
sold
out
the
entire
establishment
animals
cages
chariots
and
paraphernalia
excepting
one
elephant
which
i
retained
in
my
own
possession
two
months
for
agricultural
purposes
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
could
put
an
elephant
to
plowing
for
a
while
on
my
farm
at
bridgeport
it
would
be
a
capital
advertisement
for
the
american
museum
which
was
then
and
always
during
my
proprietorship
of
that
establishment
foremost
in
my
thoughts
so
i
sent
him
to
connecticut
in
charge
of
his
keeper
whom
i
dressed
in
oriental
costume
and
keeper
and
elephant
were
stationed
on
a
lot
which
lay
close
beside
the
track
of
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
the
keeper
was
furnished
with
a
of
the
road
with
special
instructions
to
be
busily
engaged
in
his
work
whenever
passenger
trains
from
either
way
were
passing
through
of
course
the
matter
soon
appeared
in
the
papers
and
went
the
entire
rounds
of
the
press
in
this
country
and
even
in
europe
and
it
was
everywhere
announced
that
barnum
proprietor
of
the
celebrated
american
museum
in
new
york
and
here
is
where
the
advertisement
came
in
had
introduced
elephants
upon
his
farm
to
do
his
plowing
and
heavy
draft
work
hundreds
of
people
came
many
miles
to
witness
the
novel
spectacle
letters
poured
in
upon
me
from
the
secretaries
of
hundreds
of
state
and
county
agricultural
societies
throughout
the
union
stating
that
the
presidents
and
directors
of
such
societies
had
requested
them
to
propound
to
me
a
series
of
questions
in
regard
to
the
new
power
i
had
put
in
operation
on
my
farm
these
questions
were
greatly
diversified
but
the
general
run
of
them
were
something
like
the
following
is
the
elephant
a
profitable
agricultural
animal
how
much
can
an
elephant
plow
in
a
day
how
much
can
he
draw
how
much
does
he
eat
this
question
was
invariably
asked
and
was
a
very
important
one
will
elephants
make
themselves
generally
useful
on
a
farm
i
suppose
some
of
my
inquirers
thought
the
elephant
would
pick
up
chips
or
even
pins
as
they
have
been
taught
to
do
and
would
rock
the
baby
and
do
all
the
chores
including
the
occasional
carrying
of
a
trunk
other
than
his
own
to
the
depot
what
is
the
price
of
an
elephant
where
can
elephants
be
purchased
then
would
follow
a
score
of
other
inquiries
such
as
whether
elephants
were
easily
managed
if
they
would
quarrel
with
cattle
if
it
was
possible
to
breed
them
how
old
calf
elephants
must
be
before
they
would
earn
their
own
living
and
so
on
indefinitely
i
began
to
be
alarmed
lest
some
one
should
buy
an
elephant
and
so
share
the
fate
of
the
man
who
drew
one
in
a
lottery
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
him
i
accordingly
had
a
general
letter
printed
which
i
mailed
to
all
my
anxious
inquirers
it
was
headed
strictly
confidential
and
i
then
stated
begging
my
correspondents
not
to
mention
it
that
to
me
the
elephant
was
a
valuable
agricultural
animal
because
he
was
an
excellent
illustration
advertisement
to
my
museum
but
that
to
other
farmers
he
would
prove
very
unprofitable
for
many
reasons
in
the
first
place
such
an
animal
would
cost
from
to
in
cold
weather
he
could
not
work
at
all
in
any
weather
he
could
not
earn
even
half
his
living
he
would
eat
up
the
value
of
his
own
head
trunk
and
body
every
year
and
i
begged
my
correspondents
not
to
do
so
foolish
a
thing
as
to
undertake
elephant
farming
newspaper
reporters
came
from
far
and
near
and
wrote
glowing
accounts
of
the
elephantine
performances
one
of
them
taking
a
political
view
of
the
matter
stated
that
the
elephant
s
sagacity
showed
that
he
knew
more
than
did
any
laborer
on
the
farm
and
yet
shameful
to
say
he
was
not
allowed
to
vote
another
said
that
barnum
s
elephant
built
all
the
stone
wall
on
the
farm
made
all
the
rail
fences
planted
corn
with
his
trunk
and
covered
it
with
his
foot
washed
my
windows
and
sprinkled
the
walks
and
lawns
by
taking
water
from
the
with
his
trunk
carried
all
the
children
to
school
and
put
them
to
bed
at
night
tucking
them
up
with
his
trunk
fed
the
pigs
picked
fruit
from
branches
that
could
not
otherwise
be
reached
turned
the
fanning
mill
and
drew
the
mowing
machine
and
turned
and
cocked
the
hay
with
his
trunk
carried
and
brought
my
letters
to
and
from
the
it
was
a
male
elephant
and
did
all
the
chores
about
the
house
including
milking
the
cows
and
bringing
in
eggs
pictures
of
barnum
s
plowing
elephant
appeared
in
illustrated
papers
at
home
and
abroad
and
as
the
cars
passed
the
scene
of
the
performance
passengers
heads
were
out
of
every
window
and
among
many
and
varied
exclamations
i
heard
of
one
man
s
saying
well
i
declare
that
is
certainly
a
real
elephant
and
any
man
who
has
so
many
elephants
that
he
can
afford
to
work
them
on
his
farm
must
have
lots
of
wild
animals
and
curious
critters
in
his
museum
and
i
am
bound
to
go
there
the
first
thing
after
my
arrival
in
new
the
six
acres
were
plowed
over
at
least
sixty
times
before
i
thought
the
advertisement
sufficiently
circulated
and
i
then
sold
the
elephant
to
van
amburgh
s
menagerie
a
substantial
farmer
friend
of
mine
gideon
thompson
called
at
iranistan
during
the
elephant
excitement
and
asked
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
field
to
let
him
see
how
the
big
animal
i
knew
him
to
be
a
shrewd
sharp
man
and
a
good
farmer
and
i
tried
to
excuse
myself
as
i
did
not
wish
to
be
too
closely
questioned
indeed
for
the
same
reason
i
made
it
a
point
at
all
times
to
avoid
being
present
when
the
plowing
was
going
on
but
the
old
farmer
was
a
particular
friend
and
he
refused
to
take
no
for
an
answer
so
i
went
with
him
to
see
the
arriving
at
the
field
thompson
said
nothing
but
stood
with
folded
arms
and
sedately
watched
the
elephant
for
at
least
fifteen
minutes
then
he
walked
out
on
to
the
plowed
ground
and
found
it
so
mellow
that
he
sank
nearly
up
to
his
knees
for
it
had
already
been
plowed
over
and
over
many
times
as
usual
several
spectators
were
present
thompson
walked
up
to
where
i
was
standing
and
looking
me
squarely
in
the
eyes
he
asked
with
much
earnestness
what
is
your
object
sir
in
bringing
that
great
asiatic
animal
on
to
a
new
england
farm
to
plow
i
replied
very
demurely
to
plow
said
thompson
don
t
talk
to
me
about
plowing
i
have
been
out
where
he
has
plowed
and
the
ground
is
so
soft
i
thought
i
should
go
through
and
come
out
in
china
no
sir
you
can
t
humbug
me
you
have
got
some
other
object
in
bringing
that
elephant
up
here
now
what
is
it
don
t
you
see
for
yourself
that
i
am
plowing
with
him
i
asked
nonsense
said
thompson
that
would
never
pay
i
have
no
doubt
he
eats
more
than
he
earns
every
day
you
have
some
other
purpose
in
view
i
am
sure
you
perhaps
he
does
not
eat
so
much
as
you
think
i
replied
and
you
see
he
draws
nobly
in
fact
i
expect
he
will
be
just
the
animal
by
and
by
to
draw
saw
logs
to
mill
and
do
other
heavy
but
uncle
was
not
to
be
put
aside
so
easily
so
he
asked
very
sharply
how
much
does
he
eat
in
a
day
oh
i
replied
carelessly
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
ton
of
hay
and
three
or
four
bushels
of
exactly
said
thompson
his
eyes
glistening
with
delight
that
is
just
about
what
i
expected
he
can
t
draw
so
much
as
two
pair
of
my
oxen
can
and
he
costs
more
than
a
dozen
you
are
mistaken
friend
thompson
i
replied
with
much
gravity
that
elephant
is
a
powerful
animal
he
can
draw
more
than
forty
yoke
of
oxen
and
he
pays
me
well
for
bringing
him
forty
yoke
of
oxen
contemptuously
replied
the
old
farmer
i
don
t
want
to
tell
you
i
doubt
your
word
but
i
would
just
like
to
know
what
he
can
he
can
draw
the
attention
of
twenty
millions
of
american
citizens
to
barnum
s
museum
i
replied
oh
you
can
make
him
pay
in
that
way
of
course
responded
the
old
farmer
none
but
a
greenhorn
could
ever
have
expected
he
would
pay
in
any
other
way
i
replied
the
old
man
gave
a
hearty
laugh
and
said
well
i
give
it
up
i
have
been
a
farmer
years
and
i
have
only
just
discovered
that
an
elephant
is
a
very
useful
and
profitable
animal
on
a
farm
provided
the
farmer
also
owns
a
in
i
became
a
part
owner
of
the
steamship
north
our
intention
in
buying
it
was
to
run
it
to
ireland
as
a
passenger
and
freight
ship
the
project
was
however
abandoned
and
commodore
cornelius
vanderbilt
bought
one
half
of
the
steamer
while
the
other
half
was
owned
by
three
persons
of
whom
i
was
one
the
steamer
was
sent
around
cape
horn
to
san
francisco
and
was
put
into
the
vanderbilt
line
after
she
had
made
several
trips
i
called
upon
vanderbilt
at
his
office
and
introduced
myself
as
this
was
the
first
time
we
had
met
is
it
possible
you
are
barnum
exclaimed
the
commodore
in
surprise
why
i
expected
to
see
a
monster
part
lion
part
elephant
and
a
mixture
of
rhinoceros
and
tiger
is
it
possible
he
continued
that
you
are
the
showman
who
has
made
so
much
noise
in
the
world
i
laughingly
replied
that
i
was
and
added
that
if
i
too
had
been
governed
in
my
anticipation
of
his
personal
appearance
by
the
fame
he
had
achieved
in
his
line
i
should
have
expected
to
have
been
saluted
by
a
steam
whistle
and
to
have
seen
him
dressed
in
a
pea
jacket
blowing
off
steam
and
crying
out
all
aboard
that
s
instead
of
which
replied
vanderbilt
i
suppose
you
have
come
to
ask
me
to
walk
up
to
the
captain
s
office
and
after
this
interchange
of
civilities
we
talked
about
the
success
of
the
north
america
in
having
got
safely
around
the
horn
and
of
the
acceptable
manner
in
which
she
was
doing
her
duty
on
the
pacific
side
we
have
received
no
statement
of
her
earnings
yet
said
the
commodore
but
if
you
want
money
give
your
receipt
to
our
treasurer
and
take
a
few
months
subsequent
to
this
i
sold
out
my
share
in
the
steamship
to
daniel
drew
the
day
after
closing
with
drew
i
discovered
an
error
of
several
hundred
dollars
a
matter
of
interest
on
some
portion
of
the
purchase
money
which
had
been
overlooked
i
called
on
drew
and
asked
him
to
correct
it
but
could
get
no
satisfaction
i
then
wrote
him
a
threatening
letter
but
received
no
response
i
was
on
the
eve
of
suing
him
for
the
amount
due
me
when
the
news
came
that
the
steamship
north
america
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
pacific
it
turned
out
that
she
was
sunk
several
days
before
i
sold
out
and
as
the
owners
were
mulcted
in
the
sum
of
many
thousands
of
dollars
damages
by
their
passengers
besides
suffering
a
great
loss
in
their
steamship
i
said
no
more
to
the
millionnaire
drew
about
the
few
hundreds
which
he
had
withheld
from
the
showman
some
reference
to
the
various
enterprises
and
side
shows
connected
with
and
disconnected
from
my
museum
is
necessary
to
show
how
industriously
i
have
catered
for
the
public
s
amusement
not
only
in
america
but
abroad
when
i
was
in
paris
in
in
addition
to
the
purchase
of
robert
houdin
s
ingenious
automaton
writer
and
many
other
costly
curiosities
for
the
museum
i
ordered
at
an
expense
of
a
panoramic
diorama
of
the
obsequies
of
napoleon
every
event
of
that
grand
pageant
from
the
embarkation
of
the
body
at
helena
to
its
entombment
at
the
hotel
des
invalides
amid
the
most
gorgeous
parade
ever
witnessed
in
france
was
wonderfully
depicted
this
exhibition
after
having
had
its
day
at
the
american
museum
was
sold
and
extensively
and
profitably
exhibited
elsewhere
while
i
was
in
london
during
the
same
year
i
engaged
a
company
of
campanalogians
or
lancashire
bell
ringers
then
performing
in
ireland
to
make
an
american
tour
they
were
really
admirable
performers
and
by
means
of
their
numerous
bells
of
various
sizes
they
produced
the
most
delightful
music
they
attracted
much
attention
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
in
canada
and
in
cuba
as
a
compensation
to
england
for
the
loss
of
the
bell
ringers
i
despatched
an
agent
to
america
for
a
party
of
indians
including
squaws
he
proceeded
to
iowa
and
returned
to
london
with
a
company
of
sixteen
they
were
exhibited
by
catlin
on
our
joint
account
and
were
finally
left
in
his
sole
charge
on
my
first
return
visit
to
america
from
europe
i
engaged
faber
an
elderly
and
ingenious
german
who
had
constructed
an
automaton
speaker
it
was
of
and
when
worked
with
keys
similar
to
those
of
a
piano
it
really
articulated
words
and
sentences
with
surprising
distinctness
my
agent
exhibited
it
for
several
months
in
egyptian
hall
london
and
also
in
the
provinces
this
was
a
marvellous
piece
of
mechanism
though
for
some
unaccountable
reason
it
did
not
prove
a
success
the
duke
of
wellington
visited
it
several
times
and
at
first
he
thought
that
the
voice
proceeded
from
the
exhibitor
whom
he
assumed
to
be
a
skillful
ventriloquist
he
was
asked
to
touch
the
keys
with
his
own
fingers
and
after
some
instruction
in
the
method
of
operating
he
was
able
to
make
the
machine
speak
not
only
in
english
but
also
in
german
with
which
language
the
duke
seemed
familiar
thereafter
he
entered
his
name
on
the
exhibitor
s
autograph
book
and
certified
that
the
automaton
speaker
was
an
extraordinary
production
of
mechanical
genius
during
my
first
visit
to
england
i
obtained
verbally
through
a
friend
the
refusal
of
the
house
in
which
shakespeare
was
born
designing
to
remove
it
in
sections
to
my
museum
in
new
york
but
the
project
leaked
out
british
pride
was
touched
and
several
english
gentlemen
interfered
and
purchased
the
premises
for
a
shakespearian
association
had
they
slept
a
few
days
longer
i
should
have
made
a
rare
speculation
for
i
was
subsequently
assured
that
the
british
people
rather
than
suffer
that
house
to
be
removed
to
america
would
have
bought
me
off
with
twenty
thousand
pounds
i
did
not
hesitate
to
engage
or
attempt
to
secure
anything
at
any
expense
to
please
my
patrons
in
the
united
states
and
i
made
an
effort
to
transfer
madame
tussaud
s
celebrated
collection
entire
to
new
york
the
papers
were
actually
drawn
up
for
this
engagement
but
the
enterprise
finally
fell
through
the
models
of
machinery
exhibited
in
the
royal
polytechnic
institution
in
london
pleased
me
so
well
that
i
procured
a
duplicate
also
duplicates
of
the
dissolving
views
the
chromatrope
and
physioscope
including
many
american
scenes
painted
expressly
to
my
order
at
an
aggregate
cost
of
after
they
had
been
exhibited
in
my
museum
they
were
sold
to
itinerant
showmen
and
some
of
them
were
afterwards
on
exhibition
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
in
june
i
added
the
celebrated
chinese
collection
to
the
attractions
of
the
american
museum
i
also
engaged
the
chinese
family
consisting
of
two
men
two
women
and
two
children
my
agent
exhibited
them
in
london
during
the
world
s
fair
it
may
be
stated
here
that
i
subsequently
sent
to
london
the
celebrated
artist
de
lamano
to
paint
a
panorama
of
the
crystal
palace
in
which
the
world
s
fair
was
held
and
colonel
john
dusolle
an
able
and
accomplished
editor
whom
i
sent
with
de
lamano
wrote
an
accompanying
descriptive
lecture
like
most
panoramas
however
the
exhibition
proved
a
failure
the
giants
whom
i
sent
to
america
were
not
the
greatest
of
my
curiosities
though
the
dwarfs
might
have
been
the
least
the
scotch
boys
were
interesting
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
weight
as
for
the
mysterious
method
by
which
one
of
them
though
blindfolded
answered
questions
put
by
the
other
respecting
objects
presented
by
persons
who
attended
the
surprising
exhibition
the
mystery
which
was
merely
the
result
of
patient
practice
consisted
wholly
in
the
manner
in
which
the
question
was
propounded
in
fact
the
question
invariably
carried
its
own
answer
for
instance
what
is
this
meant
gold
now
what
is
this
silver
say
what
is
this
copper
tell
me
what
this
is
iron
what
is
the
shape
long
now
what
shape
round
say
what
shape
square
please
say
what
this
is
a
watch
can
you
tell
what
is
in
this
lady
s
hand
a
purse
now
please
say
what
this
is
a
key
come
now
what
is
this
money
how
much
a
penny
now
how
much
sixpence
say
how
much
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
what
color
is
this
black
now
what
color
is
this
red
say
what
color
green
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
to
such
perfection
was
this
brought
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
present
any
object
that
could
not
be
quite
closely
described
by
the
blindfolded
boy
this
is
the
key
to
all
exhibitions
of
what
is
called
second
in
the
celebrated
bateman
children
acted
for
several
weeks
at
the
american
museum
and
in
june
of
that
year
i
sent
them
to
london
with
their
father
and
mr
le
grand
smith
where
they
played
in
the
james
theatre
and
afterwards
in
the
principal
provincial
theatres
the
elder
of
these
children
miss
kate
bateman
subsequently
attained
the
highest
histrionic
distinction
in
america
and
abroad
and
reached
the
very
head
of
her
profession
in
october
having
stipulated
with
george
a
wells
and
bushnell
that
they
should
share
in
the
enterprise
and
take
the
entire
charge
i
engaged
miss
catherine
hayes
and
herr
begnis
to
give
a
series
of
sixty
concerts
in
california
and
the
engagement
was
fulfilled
to
our
entire
satisfaction
bushnell
afterwards
went
to
australia
with
miss
hayes
and
they
were
subsequently
married
both
of
them
are
dead
before
setting
out
for
california
miss
catherine
hayes
her
mother
and
sister
spent
several
days
at
iranistan
and
were
present
at
the
marriage
of
my
eldest
daughter
caroline
to
david
thompson
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
in
the
evening
and
in
the
afternoon
i
was
getting
shaved
in
a
in
bridgeport
when
thompson
drove
up
to
the
door
in
great
haste
and
exclaimed
mr
barnum
iranistan
is
in
flames
i
ran
out
with
the
lather
on
my
face
jumped
into
his
wagon
and
bade
him
drive
home
with
all
speed
i
was
greatly
alarmed
for
the
house
was
full
of
visitors
who
had
come
from
a
distance
to
attend
the
wedding
and
all
the
costly
presents
dresses
refreshments
and
everything
prepared
for
a
marriage
celebration
to
which
nearly
a
thousand
guests
had
been
invited
were
already
in
my
house
thompson
told
me
that
he
had
seen
the
flames
bursting
from
the
roof
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
little
hope
of
saving
the
building
my
mind
was
distressed
not
so
much
at
the
great
pecuniary
loss
which
the
destruction
of
iranistan
would
involve
as
at
the
possibility
that
some
of
my
family
or
visitors
would
be
killed
or
seriously
injured
in
attempting
to
save
something
from
the
fire
then
i
thought
of
the
sore
disappointment
this
calamity
would
cause
to
the
young
couple
as
well
as
to
those
who
were
invited
to
the
wedding
i
saw
that
thompson
looked
pale
and
anxious
never
mind
said
i
we
can
t
help
these
things
the
house
will
probably
be
burned
but
if
no
one
is
killed
or
injured
you
shall
be
married
if
we
are
obliged
to
perform
the
ceremony
in
the
on
our
way
we
overtook
a
and
i
implored
them
to
hurry
up
their
arriving
in
sight
of
iranistan
we
saw
huge
volumes
of
smoke
rolling
out
from
the
roof
and
many
men
on
the
top
of
the
house
were
passing
buckets
of
water
to
pour
illustration
grove
upon
the
fire
fortunately
several
men
had
been
engaged
during
the
day
in
repairing
the
roof
and
their
ladders
were
against
the
house
by
these
means
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
men
employed
upon
my
grounds
water
was
passed
very
rapidly
and
the
flames
were
soon
subdued
without
serious
damage
the
inmates
of
iranistan
were
thoroughly
frightened
catherine
hayes
and
other
visitors
packed
their
trunks
and
had
them
carried
out
on
the
lawn
and
the
house
came
as
near
destruction
as
it
well
could
and
escape
while
miss
hayes
was
in
bridgeport
i
induced
her
to
give
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
the
mountain
grove
cemetery
and
the
large
proceeds
were
devoted
to
the
erection
of
the
beautiful
stone
tower
and
gateway
at
the
entrance
of
that
charming
ground
the
land
for
this
cemetery
about
eighty
acres
had
been
bought
by
me
years
before
from
several
farmers
i
had
often
shot
over
the
ground
while
hunting
a
year
or
two
before
and
had
then
seen
its
admirable
capabilities
for
the
purpose
to
which
it
was
eventually
devoted
after
deeds
for
the
property
were
secured
it
was
offered
for
a
cemetery
and
at
a
meeting
of
citizens
several
lots
were
subscribed
for
enough
indeed
to
cover
the
amount
of
the
purchase
money
thus
was
begun
the
mountain
grove
cemetery
which
is
now
beautifully
laid
out
and
adorned
with
many
tasteful
and
costly
monuments
among
these
are
my
own
substantial
granite
monument
the
family
monuments
of
harral
bishop
hubbell
lyon
wood
loomis
wordin
hyde
and
others
and
general
tom
thumb
has
erected
a
tall
marble
shaft
which
is
surmounted
by
a
statue
of
himself
there
is
no
more
charming
burial
ground
in
the
whole
country
yet
when
the
project
was
suggested
many
persons
preferred
an
intermural
cemetery
to
this
rural
for
their
departed
friends
though
now
all
concur
in
considering
it
fortunate
that
this
adjunct
was
secured
to
bridgeport
before
the
land
could
be
permanently
devoted
to
other
purposes
some
time
afterwards
when
dion
boucicault
visited
me
at
bridgeport
at
my
solicitation
he
gave
a
lecture
for
the
benefit
of
this
cemetery
i
may
add
that
on
several
occasions
i
have
secured
the
services
of
general
tom
thumb
and
others
for
this
and
equally
worthy
objects
in
bridgeport
when
the
general
first
returned
with
me
from
england
he
gave
exhibitions
for
the
benefit
of
the
bridgeport
charitable
society
september
i
induced
him
and
his
wife
with
commodore
nutt
and
minnie
warren
to
give
their
entertainment
for
the
benefit
of
the
bridgeport
library
thus
adding
to
the
funds
of
that
institution
and
on
one
occasion
i
lectured
to
a
full
house
in
the
methodist
church
and
the
entire
receipts
were
given
to
the
library
of
which
i
was
already

of
previous

i

it
announced
in
the
newspapers
that
alfred
bunn
the
great
of
drury
lane
theatre
in
london
had
arrived
in
boston
of
course
i
knew
bunn
by
reputation
not
only
from
his
managerial
career
but
from
the
fact
that
he
made
the
first
engagement
with
jenny
lind
to
appear
in
london
this
engagement
however
lumley
of
her
majesty
s
theatre
induced
her
to
break
he
standing
a
lawsuit
with
bunn
and
paying
heavy
damages
i
had
never
met
bunn
but
he
took
it
for
granted
that
i
had
seen
him
for
one
day
after
his
arrival
in
this
country
a
burly
englishman
abruptly
stepped
into
my
private
office
in
the
museum
and
assuming
a
theatrical
attitude
addressed
me
barnum
do
you
remember
me
i
was
confident
i
had
never
seen
the
man
before
but
it
struck
me
at
once
that
no
englishman
i
ever
heard
of
would
be
likely
to
exhibit
more
presumption
or
assumption
than
the
of
drury
lane
and
i
jumped
at
the
conclusion
is
not
this
bunn
ah
ah
my
boy
he
exclaimed
slapping
me
familiarly
on
the
back
i
thought
you
would
remember
me
well
barnum
how
have
you
been
since
i
last
saw
you
i
replied
in
a
manner
that
would
humor
his
impression
that
we
were
old
acquaintances
and
during
his
two
hours
visit
we
had
much
gossip
about
men
and
things
in
london
he
called
upon
me
several
times
and
it
probably
never
entered
into
his
mind
that
i
could
possibly
have
been
in
london
two
or
three
years
without
having
made
the
personal
acquaintance
of
so
great
a
lion
as
alfred
bunn
i
met
bunn
again
in
in
london
at
a
dinner
party
of
a
mutual
friend
levy
proprietor
of
the
london
daily
telegraph
of
course
bunn
and
i
were
great
chums
and
very
old
and
intimate
acquaintances
at
the
same
dinner
i
met
several
literary
and
dramatic
gentlemen
in
and
i
spent
much
of
my
time
at
my
beautiful
home
in
bridgeport
going
very
frequently
to
new
york
to
attend
to
matters
in
the
museum
but
remaining
in
the
city
only
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
i
resigned
the
office
of
president
of
the
fairfield
county
agricultural
society
in
but
the
members
accepted
my
resignation
only
on
condition
that
it
should
not
go
into
effect
until
after
the
fair
of
during
my
administration
the
society
held
six
fairs
and
four
in
bridgeport
and
two
in
stamford
and
the
interest
in
these
gatherings
increased
from
year
to
year
pickpockets
are
always
present
at
these
country
fairs
and
every
year
there
were
loud
complaints
of
the
depredations
of
these
operators
in
a
man
was
caught
in
the
act
of
taking
a
from
a
country
farmer
nor
was
this
farmer
the
only
one
who
had
suffered
in
the
same
way
the
scamp
was
arrested
and
proved
to
be
a
celebrated
english
pickpocket
as
the
fair
would
close
the
next
day
and
as
most
persons
had
already
visited
it
we
expected
our
receipts
would
be
light
early
in
the
morning
the
detected
party
was
legally
examined
plead
guilty
and
was
bound
over
for
trial
i
obtained
consent
from
the
sheriff
that
the
culprit
should
be
put
in
the
fair
room
for
the
purpose
of
giving
those
who
had
been
robbed
an
opportunity
to
identify
him
for
this
purpose
he
was
handcuffed
and
placed
in
a
conspicuous
position
where
of
course
he
was
the
observed
of
all
i
then
issued
handbills
stating
that
as
it
was
the
last
day
of
the
fair
the
managers
were
happy
to
announce
that
they
had
secured
extra
attractions
for
the
occasion
and
would
accordingly
exhibit
safely
handcuffed
and
without
extra
charge
a
live
pickpocket
who
had
been
caught
in
the
act
of
robbing
an
honest
farmer
the
day
previous
crowds
of
people
rushed
in
to
see
the
some
good
mothers
brought
their
children
ten
miles
for
that
purpose
and
our
treasury
was
materially
benefited
by
the
operation
at
the
close
of
my
presidency
in
i
was
requested
to
deliver
the
opening
speech
at
our
county
fair
which
was
held
at
stamford
as
i
was
not
able
to
give
agricultural
advice
i
delivered
a
portion
of
my
lecture
on
the
philosophy
of
the
next
morning
as
i
was
being
shaved
in
the
village
barber
s
shop
which
was
at
the
time
crowded
with
customers
the
to
the
fair
came
in
what
kind
of
a
house
did
you
have
last
night
asked
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
waiting
oh
of
course
barnum
always
draws
a
crowd
was
the
reply
of
the
to
whom
i
was
not
known
most
of
the
gentlemen
present
however
knew
me
and
they
found
much
difficulty
in
restraining
their
laughter
did
barnum
make
a
good
speech
i
asked
i
did
not
hear
it
i
was
out
in
the
i
guess
it
was
pretty
good
for
i
never
heard
so
much
laughing
as
there
was
all
through
his
speech
but
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
was
good
or
not
continued
the
the
people
will
go
to
see
barnum
must
be
a
curious
chap
i
remarked
well
i
guess
he
is
up
to
all
the
do
you
know
him
i
asked
not
personally
he
replied
but
i
always
get
into
the
museum
for
nothing
i
know
the
doorkeeper
and
he
slips
me
in
barnum
would
not
like
that
probably
if
he
knew
it
i
remarked
but
it
happens
he
don
t
know
it
replied
the
in
great
glee
barnum
was
on
the
cars
the
other
day
on
his
way
to
bridgeport
said
i
and
i
heard
one
of
the
passengers
blowing
him
up
terribly
as
a
humbug
he
was
addressing
barnum
at
the
time
but
did
not
know
him
barnum
joined
in
lustily
and
indorsed
everything
the
man
said
when
the
passenger
learned
whom
he
had
been
addressing
i
should
think
he
must
have
felt
rather
i
should
think
so
too
said
the
this
was
too
much
and
we
all
indulged
in
a
burst
of
laughter
still
the
suspected
nothing
after
i
had
left
the
shop
the
barber
told
him
who
i
was
i
called
into
the
on
business
several
times
during
the
day
but
the
poor
kept
his
face
turned
from
me
and
appeared
so
that
i
did
not
pretend
to
recognize
him
as
the
hero
of
the
joke
in
the
barber
s
shop
this
incident
reminds
me
of
numerous
similar
ones
which
have
occurred
at
various
times
on
one
occasion
it
was
in
i
was
on
board
the
steamboat
from
new
york
to
bridgeport
as
we
approached
the
harbor
of
the
latter
city
a
stranger
desired
me
to
point
out
barnum
s
house
from
the
upper
deck
i
did
so
whereupon
a
bystander
remarked
i
know
all
about
that
house
for
i
was
engaged
in
painting
there
for
several
months
while
barnum
was
in
he
then
proceeded
to
say
that
it
was
the
meanest
and
most
house
he
ever
saw
it
will
cost
old
barnum
a
mint
of
money
and
not
be
worth
two
cents
after
it
is
finished
he
added
i
suppose
old
barnum
don
t
pay
very
punctually
i
remarked
oh
yes
he
pays
punctually
every
saturday
night
there
s
no
trouble
about
that
he
has
made
half
a
million
by
exhibiting
a
little
boy
whom
he
took
from
bridgeport
and
whom
we
never
considered
any
great
shakes
till
barnum
took
him
and
trained
soon
afterwards
one
of
the
passengers
told
him
who
i
was
whereupon
he
secreted
himself
and
was
not
seen
again
while
i
remained
on
the
boat
on
another
occasion
i
went
to
boston
by
the
fall
river
route
arriving
before
sunrise
i
found
but
one
carriage
at
the
depot
i
immediately
engaged
it
and
giving
the
driver
the
check
for
my
baggage
told
him
to
take
me
directly
to
the
revere
house
as
i
was
in
great
haste
and
enjoined
him
to
take
in
no
other
passengers
and
i
would
pay
his
demands
he
promised
compliance
with
my
wishes
but
soon
afterwards
appeared
with
a
gentleman
two
ladies
and
several
children
whom
he
crowded
into
the
carriage
with
me
and
placing
their
trunks
on
the
baggage
rack
started
off
i
thought
there
was
no
use
in
grumbling
and
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
the
revere
house
was
not
far
away
he
drove
up
one
street
and
down
another
for
what
seemed
to
me
a
very
long
time
but
i
was
wedged
in
so
closely
that
i
could
not
see
what
route
he
was
taking
after
half
an
hour
s
drive
he
halted
and
i
found
we
were
at
the
lowell
railway
depot
here
my
alighted
and
after
a
long
delay
the
driver
delivered
their
baggage
received
his
fare
and
was
about
closing
the
carriage
door
preparatory
to
starting
again
i
was
so
thoroughly
vexed
at
the
shameful
manner
in
which
he
had
treated
me
that
i
remarked
perhaps
you
had
better
wait
till
the
lowell
train
arrives
you
may
possibly
get
another
load
of
passengers
of
course
my
convenience
is
of
no
consequence
i
suppose
if
you
land
me
at
the
revere
house
any
time
this
week
it
will
be
as
much
as
i
have
a
right
to
i
beg
your
pardon
he
replied
but
that
was
barnum
and
his
family
he
was
very
anxious
to
get
here
in
time
for
the
first
train
so
i
stuck
him
for
and
now
i
ll
carry
you
to
the
revere
house
what
barnum
is
it
i
asked
the
museum
and
jenny
lind
man
he
replied
the
compliment
and
the
shave
both
having
been
intended
for
me
i
was
of
course
mollified
and
replied
you
are
mistaken
my
friend
am
coachee
was
thunderstruck
and
offered
all
sorts
of
apologies
a
friend
at
the
other
depot
told
me
that
i
had
barnum
on
board
said
he
and
i
really
supposed
he
meant
the
other
man
when
i
come
to
notice
you
i
perceive
my
mistake
but
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
i
have
carried
you
frequently
before
and
hope
you
will
give
me
your
custom
while
you
are
in
boston
i
never
will
make
such
a
mistake
i
had
to
be
satisfied
late
in
august
i
was
visited
at
bridgeport
by
a
gentleman
who
was
interested
in
an
english
invention
patented
in
this
country
and
known
as
phillips
fire
annihilator
he
showed
me
a
number
of
certificates
from
men
of
eminence
and
trustworthiness
in
england
setting
forth
the
merits
of
the
invention
in
the
highest
terms
the
principal
value
of
the
machine
seemed
to
consist
in
its
power
to
extinguish
flame
and
thus
prevent
the
spread
of
fire
when
it
once
broke
out
besides
the
steam
or
vapor
generated
in
the
annihilator
was
not
prejudicial
to
human
life
now
as
water
has
no
effect
whatever
upon
flame
it
was
obvious
that
the
annihilator
would
at
the
least
prove
a
great
in
extinguishing
conflagrations
and
that
especially
in
the
incipient
stage
of
a
fire
it
would
extinguish
it
altogether
without
damage
to
goods
or
other
property
as
is
usually
the
case
with
water
hon
elisha
whittlesey
first
comptroller
of
the
united
states
treasury
at
washington
was
interested
in
the
american
patent
and
the
gentleman
that
called
upon
me
desired
that
i
should
also
take
an
interest
in
it
i
had
no
disposition
to
engage
in
any
speculation
but
believing
this
might
prove
a
beneficent
invention
and
be
the
means
of
saving
a
vast
amount
of
human
life
as
well
as
property
i
visited
washington
city
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
with
whittlesey
hon
allen
and
other
parties
interested
i
was
there
shown
numerous
certificates
of
fires
having
been
extinguished
by
the
machine
in
great
britain
and
property
to
the
amount
of
many
thousands
of
pounds
saved
i
also
saw
that
lord
brougham
had
proposed
in
parliament
that
every
government
vessel
should
be
compelled
to
have
the
fire
annihilator
on
board
whittlesey
expressed
his
belief
in
writing
that
if
there
is
any
reliance
to
be
placed
on
human
testimony
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
discoveries
of
this
most
extraordinary
i
fully
agreed
with
him
and
have
never
yet
seen
occasion
to
change
that
opinion
i
agreed
to
join
in
the
enterprise
whittlesey
was
elected
president
and
i
was
appointed
secretary
and
general
agent
of
the
company
i
opened
the
office
of
the
company
in
new
york
and
sold
and
engaged
machines
and
territory
in
a
few
months
to
the
amount
of
i
refused
to
receive
more
than
a
small
portion
of
the
purchase
money
until
a
public
experiment
had
tested
the
powers
of
the
machine
and
i
voluntarily
delivered
to
every
purchaser
an
agreement
signed
by
myself
in
the
following
words
if
the
public
test
and
demonstration
are
not
perfectly
successful
i
will
at
any
time
when
demanded
within
ten
days
after
the
public
trial
refund
and
pay
back
every
shilling
that
has
been
paid
into
this
office
for
machines
or
territory
for
the
sale
of
the
the
public
trial
came
off
in
hamilton
square
on
the
december
it
was
an
exceedingly
cold
and
inclement
day
phillips
who
conducted
the
experiment
was
interfered
with
and
knocked
down
by
some
rowdies
who
were
opposed
to
the
invention
and
the
building
was
ignited
and
consumed
after
he
had
extinguished
the
previous
fire
subsequently
to
this
unexpected
and
unjust
opposition
i
refunded
every
cent
which
i
had
received
sometimes
against
the
wishes
of
those
who
had
purchased
for
they
were
willing
to
wait
the
result
of
further
experiments
but
i
was
utterly
disgusted
with
the
course
of
a
large
portion
of
the
public
upon
a
subject
in
which
they
were
much
more
deeply
interested
than
i
was
the
arrangements
of
the
annihilator
company
with
phillips
the
inventor
predicated
all
payments
which
he
was
to
receive
on
sales
which
we
should
actually
make
therefore
he
really
received
nothing
and
the
entire
losses
of
the
american
company
which
were
merely
for
advertising
and
the
expense
of
trying
the
experiments
hire
of
an
office
amounted
to
nearly
of
which
my
portion
was
less
than
in
the
spring
of
the
connecticut
legislature
chartered
the
pequonnock
bank
of
bridgeport
with
a
capital
of
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
had
no
interest
whatever
in
the
charter
and
did
not
even
know
that
an
application
was
to
be
made
for
it
more
banking
capital
was
needed
in
bridgeport
in
consequence
of
the
great
increase
of
trade
and
manufactures
in
that
growing
and
prosperous
city
and
this
fact
appearing
in
evidence
the
charter
was
granted
as
a
public
benefit
the
were
opened
under
the
direction
of
state
commissioners
according
to
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
and
nearly
double
the
amount
of
capital
was
subscribed
on
the
first
day
the
stock
was
distributed
by
the
commissioners
among
several
hundred
applicants
circumstances
unexpectedly
occurred
which
induced
me
to
accept
the
presidency
of
the
bank
in
compliance
with
the
unanimous
vote
of
its
directors
feeling
that
i
could
not
from
my
many
avocations
devote
the
requisite
personal
attention
to
the
duties
of
the
office
hubbell
then
mayor
of
bridgeport
was
at
my
request
appointed
of
the
institution
in
the
fall
of
a
proposition
was
made
by
certain
parties
to
commence
the
publication
of
an
illustrated
weekly
newspaper
in
the
city
of
new
york
the
field
seemed
to
be
open
for
such
an
enterprise
and
i
invested
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
the
concern
as
special
partner
in
connection
with
two
other
gentlemen
who
each
contributed
twenty
thousand
dollars
as
general
partners
within
a
month
after
the
publication
of
the
first
number
of
the
which
was
issued
on
the
first
day
of
january
our
weekly
circulation
had
reached
seventy
thousand
numerous
and
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
for
novices
in
the
business
continued
however
to
arise
and
my
partners
becoming
weary
and
disheartened
with
constant
were
anxious
to
wind
up
the
enterprise
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
the
and
the
engravings
were
sold
to
in
boston
and
the
concern
was
closed
without
loss
in
when
the
idea
of
opening
a
world
s
fair
in
new
york
was
first
broached
i
was
waited
upon
by
riddell
and
the
other
originators
of
the
scheme
and
invited
to
join
in
getting
it
up
i
declined
giving
as
a
reason
that
such
a
project
was
in
my
opinion
premature
i
felt
that
it
was
following
quite
too
closely
upon
its
london
prototype
and
assured
the
projectors
that
i
could
see
in
it
nothing
but
certain
loss
the
plan
however
was
carried
out
and
a
charter
obtained
from
the
new
york
legislature
the
building
was
erected
on
a
plot
of
ground
upon
reservoir
square
leased
to
the
association
by
the
city
of
new
york
for
one
dollar
per
annum
the
location
being
four
miles
distant
from
the
city
hall
was
enough
of
itself
to
kill
the
enterprise
the
stock
was
readily
taken
up
however
and
the
crystal
palace
opened
to
the
public
in
july
many
thousands
of
strangers
were
brought
to
new
york
and
however
disastrous
the
enterprise
may
have
proved
to
the
stockholders
it
is
evident
that
the
general
prosperity
of
the
city
has
been
promoted
far
beyond
the
entire
cost
of
the
whole
speculation
in
february
numerous
stockholders
applied
to
me
to
accept
the
presidency
of
the
crystal
palace
or
as
it
was
termed
the
association
for
the
exhibition
of
the
industry
of
all
i
utterly
declined
listening
to
such
a
project
as
i
felt
confident
that
the
novelty
had
passed
away
and
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
revive
public
interest
in
the
affair
shortly
afterwards
however
i
was
waited
upon
by
numerous
influential
gentlemen
and
strongly
urged
to
allow
my
name
to
be
used
i
repeatedly
objected
to
this
and
at
last
consented
much
against
my
own
judgment
having
been
elected
one
of
the
directors
i
was
by
that
body
chosen
president
i
accepted
the
office
conditionally
reserving
the
right
to
decline
if
i
thought
upon
investigation
that
there
was
no
vitality
left
in
the
institution
upon
examining
the
accounts
said
to
exist
against
the
association
many
were
pronounced
indefensible
by
those
who
i
supposed
knew
the
facts
in
the
case
while
various
debts
existing
against
the
concern
were
not
exhibited
when
called
for
and
i
knew
nothing
of
their
existence
until
after
i
accepted
the
office
of
president
i
finally
accepted
it
only
because
no
suitable
person
could
be
found
who
was
willing
to
devote
his
entire
time
and
services
to
the
enterprise
and
because
i
was
frequently
urged
by
directors
and
stockholders
to
take
hold
of
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
city
at
large
inasmuch
as
it
was
well
settled
that
the
palace
would
be
permanently
closed
early
in
april
if
i
did
not
take
the
helm
these
considerations
moved
me
and
i
entered
upon
my
duties
with
all
the
vigor
which
i
could
command
to
save
it
from
bankruptcy
i
advanced
large
sums
of
money
for
the
payment
of
debts
and
tried
by
every
legitimate
means
to
create
an
excitement
and
bring
it
into
life
by
extraneous
efforts
such
as
the
the
monster
concerts
of
jullien
the
celebration
of
independence
it
was
temporarily
galvanized
and
gave
several
kicks
generally
without
material
results
except
prostrating
those
who
handled
it
too
familiarly
but
it
was
a
corpse
long
before
i
touched
it
and
i
found
after
a
thorough
trial
that
my
first
impression
was
correct
and
that
so
far
as
my
ability
was
concerned
the
dead
could
not
be
i
therefore
resigned
the
presidency
and
the
concern
soon
went
into
liquidation
in
my
esteemed
friend
reverend
moses
ballou
wrote
and
redfield
of
new
york
published
a
volume
entitled
the
divine
character
vindicated
in
which
he
reviewed
some
of
the
principal
features
of
a
work
by
the
rev
beecher
brother
of
henry
ward
beecher
the
conflict
of
ages
or
the
great
debate
on
the
moral
relations
of
god
and
the
dedication
in

volume
was
as
follows
to

dear
i
am
more
deeply
indebted
to
you
for
personal
favors
than
to
any
other
living
man
and
i
feel
that
it
is
but
a
poor
acknowledgment
to
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
volume
still
i
know
that
you
will
value
it
somewhat
not
only
for
the
sake
of
our
personal
friendship
but
because
it
is
an
advocate
of
that
interpretation
of
christianity
of
which
you
have
ever
been
a
most
generous
and
devoted

incident
which
occurred
at

in
the

of
has
been
called
to
my

by
a
lady

from

who
was
visiting
us
at
the
time
the
poem
was
sent
to
me
soon
after
the
occurrence

was
lost
and
the
subject
forgotten

my

recently
sent
it
to
me
with
the
wish
that
i
should
insert
it
in

now
come
to
a
series
of
events
which
all
things
considered
constitute
one
of
the
most
remarkable
experiences
of
my
life
an
experience
which
brought
me
much
pain
and
many
trials
which
humbled
my
pride
and
threatened
me
with
hopeless
financial
ruin
and
yet
nevertheless
put
new

in

fresh
vigor

to

in

repose
which

and

i
trust
new
and
better

in

this
trial
carried
me
through
a
severe
and
costly
discipline
and
now
that
i
have
passed
through
it
and
have
triumphed
over
it
i
can
thank
god
for
sending
it
upon
me
though
i
feel
no
special
obligations
to
the
human
instruments
employed
in
the
severe
chastening
when
the
blow
fell
upon
me
i
thought
that
i
could
never
recover
the
event
has
shown
however
that
i
have
gained
both
in
character
and
fortune
and
what
threatened
for
years
to
be
my
ruin
has
proved
one
of
the
most
fortunate
happenings
of
my
career
the
bull
run
of
my
life
s
battle
was
a
crushing
defeat
which
unknown
to
me
at
the
time
only
presaged
the
victories
which
were
to
follow
in
my
general
plan
of
presenting
the
facts
and
incidents
of
my
life
in
chronological
order
i
shall
necessarily
introduce
in
the
history
of
the
next
seven
years
an
account
of
my
entanglement
in
the
jerome
clock
company
how
i
was
drawn
into
it
how
i
got
out
of
it
and
what
it
did
to
me
and
for
me
the
great
notoriety
given
to
my
connection
with
this
concern
the
fact
that
the
journals
throughout
the
country
made
it
the
subject
of
news
gossip
sympathy
abuse
and
advice
to
and
about
me
my
friends
my
persecutors
and
the
public
generally
seems
to
demand
that
the
story
should
be
briefly
but
plainly
told
the
event
itself
has
passed
away
and
with
it
the
passions
and
excitements
that
were
born
of
it
and
i
certainly
have
no
desire
now
to
deal
in
personalities
or
to
go
into
the
question
of
the
motives
which
influenced
those
who
were
interested
any
farther
than
may
be
strictly
essential
to
a
fair
and
candid
statement
of
the
case
it
is
vital
to
the
narrative
that
i
should
give
some
account
of
the
new
city
east
bridgeport
and
my
interests
therein
which
led
directly
to
my
subsequent
complications
with
the
jerome
clock
company
in
i
purchased
from
william
noble
of
bridgeport
the
undivided
half
of
his
late
father
s
homestead
consisting
of
fifty
acres
of
land
lying
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
opposite
the
city
of
bridgeport
we
intended
this
as
the
nucleus
of
a
new
city
which
we
concluded
could
soon
be
built
up
in
consequence
of
many
natural
advantages
that
it
possesses
before
giving
publicity
to
our
plans
however
we
purchased
one
hundred
and
acres
contiguous
to
that
which
we
already
owned
and
laid
out
the
entire
property
in
regular
streets
and
lined
them
with
trees
reserving
a
beautiful
grove
of
six
or
eight
acres
which
we
inclosed
and
converted
into
a
public
park
we
then
commenced
selling
alternate
lots
at
the
same
price
which
the
land
cost
us
by
the
acre
our
sales
were
always
made
on
the
condition
that
a
suitable
store
or
manufactory
should
be
erected
upon
the
land
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
purchase
that
every
building
should
be
placed
at
a
certain
distance
from
the
street
in
a
style
of
architecture
approved
by
us
that
the
grounds
should
be
enclosed
with
acceptable
fences
and
kept
clean
and
neat
with
other
conditions
which
would
render
the
locality
a
desirable
one
for
respectable
residents
and
operate
for
the
mutual
benefit
of
all
persons
who
should
become
settlers
in
the
new
city
this
entire
property
consists
of
a
beautiful
plateau
of
ground
lying
within
less
than
half
a
mile
of
the
centre
of
bridgeport
city
considering
the
superiority
of
the
situation
it
is
a
wonder
that
the
city
of
bridgeport
was
not
originally
founded
upon
that
side
of
the
river
the
late
timothy
dwight
for
a
long
time
president
of
yale
college
in
his
travels
in
new
england
in
says
of
the
locality
there
is
not
in
the
state
a
prettier
village
than
the
borough
of
bridgeport
in
the
year
there
were
scarcely
half
a
dozen
houses
in
this
place
it
now
contains
probably
more
than
one
hundred
built
on
both
sides
of
pughquonnuck
pequonnock
river
a
beautiful
forming
at
its
mouth
the
harbor
of
bridgeport
the
situation
of
this
village
is
very
handsome
particularly
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
a
more
cheerful
and
elegant
piece
of
ground
can
scarcely
be
imagined
than
the
point
which
stretches
between
the
pughquonnuck
and
the
old
and
the
prospects
presented
by
the
harbors
at
the
mouths
of
these
streams
the
sound
and
the
surrounding
country
are
in
a
fine
season
gay
and
brilliant
perhaps
without
a
this
cheerful
and
elegant
piece
of
ground
as
dwight
so
truly
describes
it
had
only
been
kept
from
market
by
the
want
of
means
of
access
a
new
was
built
connecting
this
place
with
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
a
public
which
belonged
to
us
was
thrown
open
to
the
public
free
we
also
obtained
from
the
state
legislature
a
charter
for
erecting
a
between
the
two
bridges
already
existing
and
under
that
charter
we
put
up
a
fine
covered
at
a
cost
of
which
also
we
made
free
to
the
public
for
several
years
we
built
and
leased
to
a
union
company
of
young
coach
makers
a
large
and
elegant
coach
manufactory
which
was
one
of
the
first
buildings
erected
there
and
which
went
into
operation
on
the
first
of
january
and
was
the
beginning
of
the
extensive
manufactories
which
were
subsequently
built
in
east
bridgeport
besides
the
inducement
which
we
held
out
to
purchasers
to
obtain
their
lots
at
a
merely
nominal
price
we
advanced
one
half
and
frequently
all
the
funds
necessary
to
erect
their
buildings
permitting
them
to
repay
us
in
sums
as
small
as
five
dollars
at
their
own
convenience
this
arrangement
enabled
many
persons
to
secure
and
ultimately
pay
for
homes
which
they
could
not
otherwise
have
obtained
we
looked
for
our
profits
solely
to
the
rise
in
the
value
of
the
reserved
lots
which
we
were
confident
must
ensue
of
course
these
extraordinary
inducements
led
many
persons
to
build
in
the
new
city
and
it
began
to
develop
and
increase
with
a
rapidity
rarely
witnessed
in
this
section
of
the
country
indeed
our
speculation
which
might
be
termed
a
profitable
philanthropy
soon
promised
to
be
so
remunerative
that
i
offered
noble
for
his
interest
in
the
estate
more
than
the
prime
cost
which
offer
he
declined
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
in
my
pet
scheme
was
to
build
up
a
city
in
east
bridgeport
i
had
made
a
large
fortune
and
was
anxious
to
be
released
from
the
harassing
cares
of
active
business
but
i
could
not
be
idle
and
if
i
could
be
instrumental
in
giving
value
to
land
comparatively
worthless
if
i
could
by
the
judicious
investment
of
a
portion
of
my
capital
open
the
way
for
new
industries
and
new
homes
i
should
be
of
service
to
my
fellow
men
and
find
grateful
employment
for
my
energies
and
time
i
saw
that
in
case
of
success
there
was
profit
in
my
project
and
i
was
enough
like
mankind
in
general
to
look
upon
the
enlargement
of
my
means
as
a
consummation
devoutly
and
legitimately
to
be
wished
yet
i
can
truly
say
that
mere
was
a
secondary
consideration
in
my
scheme
i
wanted
to
build
a
city
on
the
beautiful
plateau
across
the
river
in
the
expressive
phrase
of
the
day
i
had
east
bridgeport
on
the
whoever
approached
me
with
a
project
which
looked
to
the
advancement
of
my
new
city
touched
my
weak
side
and
found
me
an
eager
listener
the
serpent
that
beguiled
me
was
any
plausible
proposition
that
promised
prosperity
to
east
bridgeport
and
it
was
in
this
way
that
the
coming
city
connected
me
with
that
source
of
so
many
annoyances
and
woes
the
jerome
clock
company
there
was
a
small
clock
manufactory
in
the
town
of
litchfield
connecticut
in
which
i
became
a
stockholder
to
the
amount
of
six
or
seven
thousand
dollars
and
my
duties
as
a
director
in
the
company
called
me
occasionally
to
litchfield
and
made
me
somewhat
acquainted
with
the
clock
business
thinking
of
plans
to
forward
my
pet
east
bridgeport
enterprise
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
the
litchfield
clock
concern
could
be
transferred
to
my
prospective
new
city
it
would
necessarily
bring
many
families
thus
increasing
the
growth
of
the
place
and
the
value
of
the
property
negotiations
were
at
once
commenced
and
the
desired
transfer
of
the
business
was
the
result
a
new
stock
company
was
formed
under
the
name
of
the
terry
barnum
manufacturing
company
and
in
a
factory
was
built
in
east
bridgeport
in
i
received
a
suggestion
from
a
citizen
of
new
haven
that
the
jerome
clock
company
then
reputed
to
be
a
wealthy
concern
should
be
removed
to
east
bridgeport
and
shortly
afterwards
i
was
visited
at
iranistan
by
chauncey
jerome
the
president
of
that
company
the
result
of
this
visit
was
a
proposition
from
the
agent
of
the
company
who
also
held
power
of
attorney
for
the
president
that
i
should
lend
my
name
as
security
for
in
aid
of
the
jerome
clock
company
and
the
proffered
compensation
was
the
transfer
of
this
great
manufacturing
concern
with
its
seven
hundred
to
one
thousand
operatives
to
my
beloved
east
bridgeport
it
was
just
the
bait
for
the
fish
i
was
all
attention
yet
i
must
do
my
judgment
the
justice
to
say
that
i
called
for
proofs
strong
and
ample
that
the
great
company
deserved
its
reputation
as
a
substantial
enterprise
that
might
safely
be
trusted
accordingly
i
was
shown
an
official
report
of
the
directors
of
the
company
exhibiting
a
capital
of
and
a
surplus
of
in
all
the
need
for
more
was
on
account
of
a
dull
season
and
the
market
glutted
with
the
goods
and
immediate
money
demands
which
must
be
met
i
was
also
impressed
with
the
pathetic
tale
that
the
company
was
exceedingly
loth
to
dismiss
any
of
the
operatives
who
would
suffer
greatly
if
their
only
dependence
for
their
daily
food
was
taken
away
the
official
statement
seemed
satisfactory
and
i
cordially
sympathized
with
the
philanthropic
purpose
of
keeping
the
workmen
employed
even
in
the
dull
season
the
company
was
reputed
to
be
rich
the
president
chauncey
jerome
had
built
a
church
in
new
haven
at
a
cost
of
and
proposed
to
present
it
to
a
congregation
he
had
given
a
clock
to
a
church
in
bridgeport
and
these
things
showed
that
he
at
least
thought
he
was
wealthy
the
jerome
clocks
were
for
sale
all
over
the
world
even
in
china
where
the
celestials
were
said
to
take
out
the
movements
and
use
the
cases
for
little
temples
for
their
idols
thus
proving
that
faith
was
possible
without
so
wealthy
and
so
a
company
would
surely
be
a
grand
acquisition
to
my
city
further
testimony
came
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
the
cashier
of
one
of
the
new
haven
banks
expressing
the
highest
confidence
in
the
financial
strength
of
the
concern
and
much
satisfaction
that
i
contemplated
giving
temporary
aid
which
would
keep
so
many
workmen
and
their
families
from
suffering
and
perhaps
starvation
i
had
not
at
the
time
the
slightest
suspicion
that
my
voluntary
correspondent
had
any
interest
in
the
transfer
of
the
jerome
company
from
new
haven
to
east
bridgeport
though
i
was
subsequently
informed
that
the
bank
of
which
my
correspondent
was
the
cashier
was
almost
the
largest
if
not
the
largest
creditor
of
the
clock
company
under
all
the
circumstances
and
influenced
by
the
representations
made
to
me
not
less
than
by
my
mania
to
push
the
growth
of
my
new
city
i
finally
accepted
the
proposition
and
consented
to
an
agreement
that
i
would
lend
the
clock
company
my
notes
for
a
sum
not
to
exceed
and
accept
drafts
to
an
amount
not
to
exceed
it
was
thoroughly
understood
that
i
was
in
no
case
to
be
responsible
for
one
cent
in
excess
of
i
also
received
the
written
guaranty
of
chauncey
jerome
that
in
no
event
should
i
lose
by
the
loan
as
he
would
become
personally
responsible
for
the
repayment
i
was
willing
that
my
notes
when
taken
up
should
be
renewed
i
cared
not
how
often
provided
the
stipulated
maximum
of
should
never
be
exceeded
i
was
weak
enough
however
under
the
representation
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
exactly
when
it
would
be
necessary
to
use
the
notes
to
put
my
name
to
several
notes
for
and
leaving
the
date
of
payment
blank
but
it
was
agreed
that
the
blanks
should
be
filled
to
make
the
notes
payable
in
five
ten
or
even
sixty
days
from
date
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
and
i
was
careful
to
keep
a
memorandum
of
the
several
amounts
of
the
notes
on
the
other
side
it
was
agreed
that
the
jerome
company
should
exchange
its
stock
with
the
terry
barnum
stockholders
and
thus
absorb
that
company
and
unite
the
entire
business
in
east
bridgeport
it
was
scarcely
a
month
before
the
secretary
wrote
me
that
the
company
would
soon
be
in
condition
to
snap
its
fingers
at
the
nevertheless
three
months
after
the
consolidation
of
the
companies
a
reference
to
my
memoranda
showed
that
i
had
already
become
responsible
for
the
stipulated
sum
of
i
was
then
called
upon
in
new
york
by
the
agent
who
wanted
five
notes
of
each
and
i
declined
to
furnish
them
unless
i
should
receive
in
return
an
equal
amount
in
my
own
cancelled
notes
since
he
assured
me
they
were
cancelling
these
every
the
cancelled
notes
were
brought
to
me
next
day
and
i
renewed
them
this
i
did
frequently
always
receiving
cancelled
notes
till
finally
my
confidence
in
the
company
became
so
established
that
i
did
not
ask
to
see
the
notes
that
had
been
taken
up
but
furnished
new
accommodation
paper
as
it
was
called
for
by
and
by
i
heard
that
the
banks
began
to
hesitate
about
discounting
my
paper
and
knowing
that
i
was
good
for
several
times
over
i
wondered
what
was
the
matter
till
the
discovery
came
at
last
that
my
notes
had
not
been
taken
up
as
was
represented
and
that
some
of
the
blank
date
notes
had
been
made
payable
in
twelve
eighteen
and
months
further
investigation
revealed
the
frightful
fact
that
i
had
endorsed
for
the
clock
company
to
the
extent
of
more
than
half
a
million
dollars
and
most
of
the
notes
had
been
exchanged
for
old
jerome
company
notes
due
to
the
banks
and
other
creditors
my
agent
who
made
these
startling
discoveries
came
back
to
me
with
the
refreshing
intelligence
that
i
was
a
ruined
man
not
quite
i
had
the
mountain
of
jerome
debts
on
my
back
but
i
found
means
to
pay
every
claim
against
me
at
my
bank
all
my
store
and
shop
debts
notes
to
the
amount
of
which
banks
in
my
neighborhood
relying
upon
my
personal
integrity
had
discounted
for
the
clock
company
and
then
i
failed
what
a
dupe
had
i
been
here
was
a
great
company
pretending
to
be
worth
asking
temporary
assistance
to
the
amount
of
coming
down
with
a
crash
so
soon
as
my
helping
hand
was
removed
and
sweeping
me
down
with
it
it
failed
and
even
after
absorbing
my
fortune
it
paid
but
from
twelve
to
fifteen
per
cent
of
its
obligations
while
to
cap
the
climax
it
never
removed
to
east
bridgeport
at
all
notwithstanding
this
was
the
only
condition
which
ever
prompted
me
to
advance
one
dollar
to
the
rotten
concern
if
at
any
time
my
vanity
had
been
chilled
by
the
fear
that
after
my
retirement
from
the
jenny
lind
enterprise
the
world
would
forget
me
this
affair
speedily
reassured
me
i
had
notice
enough
to
satisfy
the
most
inordinate
craving
for
notoriety
all
over
the
country
and
even
across
the
ocean
barnum
and
the
jerome

bubble
was
the
great

i
was
taken
to
pieces
analyzed

tumbled

preached
to
preached

and
made
to

every
purpose
to
which
a
world
could
put
me
well
i
was
now
in
training
in
a
new
school
and
was
learning
new
and
strange
lessons
yet
these
new
lessons
conveyed
the
old
old
story
there
were
those
who
had
fawned
upon
me
in
my
prosperity
who
now
jeered
at
my
adversity
people
whom
i
had
specially
favored
made
special
efforts
to
show
their
ingratitude
papers
which
when
i
had
the
means
to
make
it
an
object
for
them
to
be
on
good
terms
with
me
overloaded
me
with
adulation
now
attempted
to
overwhelm
me
with
abuse
and
then
the
immense
amount
of
moralizing
over
the
instability
of
human
fortunes
and
especially
the
retributive
justice
that
is
sure
to

gains
which
my
censors
assumed
to
be
the
sum

substance
of
my
honorably
acquired
and
industriously
worked
for
property
i
have
no
doubt
that
much
of
this
kind
of
twaddle
was
believed
by
the
twaddlers
to
be
sincere
and
thus
my
case
was
actual
capital
to
certain
preachers
and
religious
editors
who
were
in
want
of
fresh
illustrations
wherewith
to
point
their
morals

for

i
was
in

i
did
not
despond
i
was
confident
that
with
energetic
purpose
and
divine
assistance
i
should
if
my
health
and
life
were
spared
get
on
my
feet
again
and

have
since
fully
justified
and

for

me

of
a
small

came

that

there
was
a
proposition
among
leading
citizens
in
new
york
to
give
a
series
of
benefits
which
i
felt
obliged
to
decline
though
the
movement
in
my
favor
deeply
touched
me
to
show
the
class
of
men
who
sympathized
with
me
in
my
misfortunes
and
also
the
ground
which
i
took
in
the
matter
i
venture
to
copy
the
following
correspondence
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
papers
of
the
day
new
york
june
barnum
the
financial
ruin
of
a
man
of
acknowledged
energy
and
enterprise
is
a
public
calamity
the
sudden
blow
therefore
that
has
swept
away
from
a
man
like
yourself
the
accumulated
wealth
of
years
justifies
we
think
the
public
sympathy
the
better
to
manifest
our
sincere
respect
for
your
liberal
example
in
prosperity
as
well
as
exhibit
our
honest
admiration
of
your
fortitude
under
overwhelming
reverses
we
propose
to
give
that
sympathy
a
tangible
expression
by
soliciting
your
acceptance
of
a
series
of
benefits
for
your
family
the
result
of
which
may
possibly
secure
for
your
wife
and
children
a
future
home
or
at
least
rescue
them
from
the
more
immediate
consequences
of

i

my
gratitude
for
your
very
kind
proposition
the
popular
sympathy
is
to
me
far

and
that
sympathy
seems
in
my

to
extend
from

many

have

i
have
on
principle
respectfully
declined
them
all
as
i
beg
with
the
most
grateful
acknowledgments
at
least
for
the
present
to
decline
yours
not
because
a
benefit
in
itself
is
an
objectionable
thing
but
because
i
have
ever
made
it
a
point
to
ask
nothing
of
the
public
on
personal
grounds
and
should
prefer
while
i
can
possibly
avoid
that
contingency
to
accept
nothing
from
it
without
the
honest
conviction
that
i
had
individually
given
it
in
return
a
full
equivalent
while
favored
with
health
i
feel
competent
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
for
myself
and
family
more
than
this
i
shall
certainly
never
attempt
with
such
a
load
of
debt
suspended
in
terrorem
over
me
while
i
earnestly
thank
you
therefore
for
your
generous
consideration
gentlemen
i
trust
you
will
appreciate
my
desire
to
live
unhumiliated
by
a
sense
of
dependence
and
believe
me
sincerely

from

may
my
dear
barnum
i
understand
your
friends
and
that
means
all
creation
intend
to
get
up
some
benefits
for
your
family
now
my
dear
sir
just
be
good
enough
to
remember
that
i
belong
to
that
mighty
crowd
and
i
must
have
a
finger
or
at
least
a
thumb
in
that
pie
i
am
bound
to
appear
on
all
such
occasions
in
some
shape
from
jack
the
giant
killer
up
stairs
to
the
doorkeeper
down
whichever
may
serve
you
best
and
there
are
some
feats
that
i
can
perform
as
well
as
any
other
man
of
my
inches
i
have
just
started
out
on
my
western
tour
and
have
my
carriage
ponies
and
assistants
all
here
but
i
am
ready
to
go
on
to
new
york
bag
and
baggage
and
remain
at
barnum
s
service
as
long
as
i
in
my
small
way
can
be
useful
put
me
into
any
heavy
work
if
you
like
perhaps
i
can
not
lift
as
much
as
some
other
folks
but
just
take
your
pencil
in
hand
and
you
will
see
i
can
draw
a
tremendous
load
i
drew
two
hundred
tons
at
a
single
pull
embracing
two
thousand
persons
whom
i
hauled
up
safely
and
satisfactorily
to
all
parties
at
one
exhibition
hoping
that
you
will
be
able
to
fix
up
a
lot
of
magnets
that
will
attract
all
new
york
and
volunteering
to
sit
on
any
part
of
the
loadstone
i
am
as
ever
your
little
but
sympathizing
friend
tom
thumb
even
this
generous
offer
from
my
little
friend
i
felt
compelled
to
refuse
but
kind
words
were
written
and
spoken
which
i
could
not
prevent
nor
did
i
desire
to
do
so
and
which
were
worth
more
to
me
than
money
i
should
fail
to
find
space
if
i
wished
it
to
copy
part
of
the
cordial
and
kind
articles
and
paragraphs
that
appeared
about
me
in
newspapers
throughout
the
country
the
following
sentence
from
an
editorial
article
in
a
prominent
new
york
journal
was
the
to
many
similar
kind
notices
in
all
parts
of
the
union
it
is
a
fact
beyond
dispute
that
barnum
s
financial
difficulties
have
accumulated
from
the
goodness
of
his
nature
and
generous
to
a
fault
it
has
ever
been
his
custom
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
the
struggling
and
honest
industry
and
enterprise
have
found
his
friendship
prompt
and
the
dwelt
especially
upon
the
use
i
had
made
of
my
money
in
my
days
of
prosperity
in
assisting
deserving
laboring
men
and
in
giving
an
impulse
to
business
in
the
town
where
i
resided
it
seems
only
just
that
i
should
make
this
very
brief
allusion
to
these
things
if
only
as
an
offset
to
the
unbounded
abuse
of
those
who
believed
in
kicking
me
merely
because
i
was
down
nor
can
i
refrain
from
copying
the
following
from
the
saturday
evening
of
may
barnum

a
word
for
barnum
barnum

though
you
are
down
and

and
though
they

prove
that
misfortune
makes
you
bolder
there
s

a

that
sneers
my
hero
and
former
praise
converts
to
scorning
would
worship
when
he
fears
a

where

may

i
wrote
while
preparing
this
autobiography
to

one
of
the
editors
of
the
journal
and
well
known
to
the
public
as
mrs
in
reply
i
received
the
following
letter
in
which
it
will
be
seen
that
he
makes
sympathetic
allusion
to
the
burning
of
my
last
museum
only
a
few
weeks
before
the
date
of
his
letter
chelsea
april
my
dear
barnum
the
poem
in
question
was
written
by
wallace
thaxter
associate
editor
with
clapp
and
myself
on
the
since
deceased
a
glorious
fellow
who
wrote
the
poem
from
a
sincere
feeling
of
admiration
for
yourself
clapp
hon
clapp
published
it
with
his
full
approbation
i
heard
of
your
new
trouble
in
my
sick
chamber
where
i
have
been
all
winter
with
regret
and
wish
you
as
ready
a
release
from
attending
difficulty
as
your
genius
has
hitherto
achieved
under
like
circumstances
yours
very
truly
shillaber
but
the
manifestations
of
sympathy
which
came
to
me
from
bridgeport
where
my
home
had
been
for
more
than
ten
years
were
the
most
gratifying
of
all
because
they
showed
unmistakably
that
my
best
friends
those
who
were
most
constant
in
their
friendship
and
most
emphatic
in
their
esteem
were
my
neighbors
and
associates
who
of
all
people
knew
me
best
with
such
support
i
could
easily
endure
the
attacks
of
traducers
elsewhere
the
york
april
under
the
head
of
sympathy
for
barnum
published
a
full
report
of
the
meeting
of
my
of
bridgeport
the
previous
evening
to
take
my
case
into
consideration
in
response
to
a
call
headed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
signed
by
several
hundred
citizens
this
meeting
was
held
in
washington
hall
for
the
purpose
of
sympathizing
with
barnum
in
his
recent
pecuniary
embarrassments
and
of
giving
some
public
expression
to
their
views
in
reference
to
his
financial
it
was
the
largest
public
meeting
which
up
to
that
time
had
ever
been
held
in
bridgeport
several
prominent
citizens
made
addresses
and
resolutions
were
adopted
declaring
that
respect
and
sympathy
were
due
to
barnum
in
return
for
his
many
acts
of
liberality
philanthropy
and
public
spirit
expressing
unshaken
confidence
in
his
integrity
admiration
for
the
fortitude
and
composure
with
which
he
has
met
reverses
into
which
he
has
been
dragged
through
no
fault
of
his
own
except
a
too
generous
confidence
in
pretended
friends
and
hoping
that
he
would
yet
return
to
that
wealth
which
he
has
so
nobly
employed
and
to
the
community
he
has
so
signally
during
the
evening
the
following
letter
was
read
new
york
thursday
april
wm
noble
i
have
just
received
a
slip
containing
a
call
for
a
public
meeting
of
the
citizens
of
bridgeport
to
sympathize
with
me
in
my
troubles
it
is
headed
by
his
honor
the
mayor
and
is
signed
by
most
of
your
prominent
citizens
as
well
as
by
many
men
who
by
hard
labor
earn
their
daily
bread
and
who
appreciate
a
calamity
which
at
a
single
blow
strips
a
man
of
his
fortune
his
dear
home
and
all
the
worldly
comforts
which
years
of
diligent
labor
had
acquired
it
is
due
to
truth
to
say
that
i
knew
nothing
of
this
movement
until
your
letter
informed
me
of
it
in
misfortune
the
true
sympathy
of
neighbors
is
more
consoling
and
precious
than
anything
which
money
can
purchase
this
voluntary
offering
of
my
though
it
thrills
me
with
painful
emotions
and
causes
tears
of
gratitude
yet
imparts
to
me
renewed
strength
and
fills
my
heart
with
thankfulness
to
providence
for
raising
up
to
my
sight
above
all
this
wreck
kind
hearts
which
soar
above
the
sordid
atmosphere
of
dirty
i
can
never
forget
this
unexpected
kindness
from
my
old
friends
and
neighbors
i
trust
i
am
not
blind
to
my
many
faults
and
shortcomings
i
however
do
feel
great
consolation
in
believing
that
i
never
used
money
or
position
to
oppress
the
poor
or
wrong
my
and
that
i
never
turned
empty
away
those
whom
i
had
the
power
to
assist
my
poor
sick
wife
who
needs
the
bracing
air
which
our
own
dear
home
made
beautiful
by
her
willing
hands
would
now
have
afforded
her
is
driven
by
the
orders
of
her
physician
to
a
secluded
spot
on
long
island
where
the
lends
its
healthful
influence
and
where
i
have
also
retired
for
the
double
purpose
of
consoling
her
and
of
recruiting
my
own
constitution
which
through
the
excitements
of
the
last
few
months
has
most
seriously
failed
me
in
our
quiet
and
humble
retreat
that
which
i
most
sincerely
pray
for
is
tranquillity
and
contentment
i
am
sure
that
the
remembrance
of
the
kindness
of
my
bridgeport
neighbors
will
aid
me
in
securing
these
cherished
blessings
no
man
who
has
not
passed
through
similar
scenes
can
fully
comprehend
the
misery
which
has
been
crowded
into
the
last
few
months
of
my
life
but
i
have
endeavored
to
preserve
my
integrity
and
i
humbly
hope
and
believe
that
i
am
being
taught
humility
and
reliance
upon
providence
which
will
yet
afford
a
thousand
times
more
peace
and
true
happiness
than
can
be
acquired
in
the
din
strife
and
turmoil
excitements
and
struggles
of
this
age
the
man
who
coins
his
brain
and
blood
into
gold
who
wastes
all
of
his
time
and
thought
upon
the
almighty
dollar
who
looks
no
higher
than
blocks
of
houses
and
tracts
of
land
and
whose
iron
chest
is
crammed
with
stocks
and
mortgages
tied
up
with
his
own
may
console
himself
with
the
idea
of
safe
investments
but
he
misses
a
pleasure
which
i
firmly
believe
this
lesson
was
intended
to
secure
to
me
and
which
it
will
secure
if
i
can
fully
bring
my
mind
to
realize
its
wisdom
i
think
i
hear
you
say
when
the
devil
was
sick
the
devil
a
saint
would
be
but
when
the
devil
got
well
the
devil
a
saint
was
granted
but
after
all
the
man
who
looks
upon
the
loss
of
money
as
anything
compared
to
the
loss
of
honor
or
health
or
or
friends
a
man
who
can
find
no
source
of
happiness
except
in
riches
is
to
be
pitied
for
his
blindness
i
certainly
feel
that
the
loss
of
money
of
home
and
my
home
comforts
is
dreadful
that
to
be
driven
again
to
find
a
away
from
those
i
love
and
from
where
i
had
fondly
supposed
i
was
to
end
my
days
and
where
i
had
lavished
time
money
everything
to
make
my
descent
to
the
grave
placid
and
pleasant
is
indeed
a
severe
lesson
but
after
all
i
firmly
believe
it
is
for
the
best
and
though
my
heart
may
break
i
will
not
repine
i
regret
beyond
expression
that
any
man
should
be
a
loser
for
having
trusted
to
my
name
it
would
not
have
been
so
if
i
had
not
myself
been
deceived
as
it
is
i
am
gratified
in
knowing
that
all
my
individual
obligations
will
be
met
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
clock
creditors
had
accepted
the
best
offer
that
it
was
in
my
power
to
make
them
but
it
was
not
so
to
be
it
is
now
too
late
and
as
i
willingly
give
up
all
i
possess
i
can
do
no
more
wherever
my
future
lot
may
be
cast
i
shall
ever
fondly
cherish
the
kindness
which
i
have
always
received
from
the
citizens
of
bridgeport
i
am
my
dear
sir
truly
yours
barnum
shortly
after
this
sympathetic
meeting
a
number
of
gentlemen
in
bridgeport
offered
me
a
loan
of
if
that
sum
would
be
instrumental
in
extricating
me
from
my
entanglement
i
could
not
say
that
this
amount
would
meet
the
exigency
i
could
only
say
wait
wait
and
meanwhile
my
eyes
were
fully
opened
to
the
entire
magnitude
of
the
deception
that
had
been
practised
upon
my
too
confiding
nature
i
not
only
discovered
that
my
notes
had
been
used
to
five
times
the
amount
i
stipulated
or
expected
but
that
they
had
been
applied
not
to
relieving
the
company
from
temporary
embarrassment
after
my
connection
with
it
but
almost
wholly
to
the
redemption
of
old
and
rotten
claims
of
years
and
months
gone
by
to
show
the
extent
to
which
the
fresh
victim
was
deliberately
bled
it
may
be
stated
that
i
was
induced
to
become
surety
to
one
of
the
new
haven
banks
in
the
sum
of
to
indemnify
the
bank
against
future
losses
it
might
incur
from
the
jerome
company
after
my
connection
with
it
and
by
some
legerdemain
this
bond
was
made
to
cover
past
obligations
which
were
older
even
than
my
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
company
in
every
way
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
been
cruelly
swindled
and
deliberately
defrauded
as
the
clock
company
had
gone
to
pieces
and
was
paying
but
from
twelve
to
fifteen
per
cent
for
its
paper
i
sent
two
of
my
friends
to
new
haven
to
ask
for
a
meeting
of
the
creditors
and
i
instructed
them
to
say
in
substance
for
me
as
follows
gentlemen
this
is
a
capital
practical
joke
before
i
negotiated
with
your
clock
company
at
all
i
was
assured
by
several
of
you
and
particularly
by
a
representative
of
the
bank
which
was
the
largest
creditor
of
the
concern
that
the
jerome
company
was
eminently
responsible
and
that
the
head
of
the
same
was
uncommonly
pious
on
the
strength
of
such
representations
solely
i
was
induced
to
agree
to
indorse
and
accept
paper
for
that
company
to
the
extent
of
no
more
that
sum
i
am
now
willing
to
pay
for
my
own
verdancy
with
an
additional
sum
of
for
your
cuteness
making
a
total
of
which
you
can
have
if
you
cry
quits
with
the
fleeced
showman
and
let
him
many
of
the
old
creditors
favored
this
proposition
but
it
was
found
that
the
indebtedness
was
so
scattered
it
would
be
impracticable
to
attempt
a
settlement
by
an
unanimous
compromise
of
the
creditors
it
was
necessary
to
liquidation
that
my
property
should
go
into
the
hands
of
assignees
i
therefore
at
once
turned
over
my
bridgeport
property
to
connecticut
assignees
and
i
removed
my
family
to
new
york
where
i
also
made
an
assignment
of
all
my
real
and
personal
estate
excepting
what
had
already
been
transferred
in
connecticut
about
this
time
i
received
a
letter
from
philadelphia
proferring
in
case
my
circumstances
were
such
that
i
really
stood
in
need
of
help
the
very
wording
of
the
letter
awakened
the
suspicion
in
my
mind
that
it
was
a
trick
to
ascertain
whether
i
really
had
any
property
for
i
knew
that
banks
and
brokers
in
that
city
held
some
of
my
jerome
paper
which
they
refused
to
compound
or
compromise
so
i
at
once
wrote
that
i
did
need
and
as
i
expected
the
money
did
not
come
nor
was
my
letter
answered
but
as
a
natural
consequence
the
philadelphia
bankers
who
were
holding
the
jerome
paper
for
a
higher
percentage
at
once
acceded
to
the
terms
which
i
had
announced
myself
able
and
willing
to
pay
every
dollar
which
i
honestly
owed
on
my
own
account
i
had
already
paid
in
full
or
had
satisfactorily
arranged
for
the
liabilities
incurred
by
the
deliberate
deception
which
had
involved
me
i
offered
such
a
percentage
as
i
thought
my
estate
when
sold
would
eventually
pay
and
my
wife
from
her
own
property
advanced
from
time
to
time
money
to
take
up
such
notes
as
could
be
secured
upon
these
terms
it
was
however
a
slow
process
more
than
one
creditor
would
hold
on
to
his
note
which
possibly
he
had
shaved
at
the
rate
of
two
or
three
per
cent
a
month
and
say
oh
you
can
t
keep
barnum
down
he
will
dig
out
after
a
while
i
shall
never
sell
my
claim
for
less
than
par
and
of
course
i
knew
very
well
that
if
all
the
creditors
took
this
view
i
should
never
get
out
of
the
entanglement
in
which
i
had
been
involved
by
the
old
creditors
of
the
jerome
company
who
had
so
ingeniously
managed
to
make
me
take
their
place
all
i
could
do
was
to
take
a
thorough
survey
of
the
situation
and
consider
now
that
i
was
down
how
i
could
get
up
again
every
cloud
says
the
proverb
has
a
silver
lining
and
so
i
did
not
despair
this
blow
i
thought
may
be
beneficial
to
my
children
if
not
to
they
had
been
brought
up
in
luxury
accustomed
to
call
on
servants
to
attend
to
every
want
and
almost
unlimited
in
the
expenditure
of
money
my
daughter
helen
especially
was
naturally
extravagant
she
was
a
generous
girl
who
knew
literally
nothing
of
the
value
of
money
and
the
difficulty
of
acquiring
it
at
this
time
she
was
fifteen
years
old
and
was
attending
a
french
boarding
school
in
the
city
of
washington
a
few
days
after
the
news
of
my
failure
was
published
in
the
papers
my
friend
the
rev
chapin
of
new
york
was
at
my
house
he
had
long
been
intimate
with
my
family
and
was
well
acquainted
with
the
extravagant
ideas
and
ways
of
my
daughter
helen
one
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
her
filled
with
sympathy
and
sorrow
for
my
misfortunes
she
told
me
how
much
shocked
she
was
at
hearing
of
my
financial
disasters
and
added
do
send
for
me
immediately
for
i
can
not
think
of
remaining
here
at
an
expense
which
my
parents
can
not
afford
i
have
learned
to
play
the
piano
well
enough
to
be
able
to
take
some
little
girls
as
pupils
and
in
this
way
i
can
be
of
some
assistance
in
supporting
the
on
reading
this
i
was
deeply
affected
and
handing
the
letter
to
chapin
i
said
there
sir
is
a
letter
which
is
worth
ten
thousand
twenty
thousand
at

least

the
exclamation
of
the
doctor

he
had
read
it

were
now

retire
from
active
business
i
sold
the
american
museum
collection
and
good
will
to
john
greenwood
junior
and
henry
butler
they
paid
me
double
the
amount
the
collection
had
originally
cost
giving
me
notes
for
nearly
the
entire
amount
secured
by
a
chattel
mortgage
and
hired
the
premises
from
my
wife
who
owned
the
museum
property
lease
and
on
which
by
the
agreement
of
greenwood
and
butler
she
realized
a
profit
of
a
year
the
chattel
mortgage
of
greenwood
and
butler
was
of
course
turned
over
to
the
new
york
assignee
with
the
other
property
and
now
there
came
to
me
a
new
sensation
which
was
at
times
terribly
depressing
and
annoying
my
reputation
for
shrewdness
as
a
showman
had
induced
the
general
belief
that
my
means
were
still
ample
and
certain
outside
creditors
who
had
bought
my
clock
notes
at
a
tremendous
discount
and
entirely
on
speculation
made
up
their
minds
that
they
must
be
paid
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
slow
process
of
the
sale
of
my
property
by
the
assignees
they
therefore
took
what
are
termed
supplementary
proceedings
which
enabled
them
to
haul
me
any
day
before
a
judge
for
the
purpose
as
they
phrased
it
of
putting
barnum
through
a
course
of
sprouts
and
which
meant
an
examination
of
the
debtor
under
oath
compelling
him
to
disclose
everything
with
regard
to
his
property
his
present
means
of
living
and
so
on
i
repeatedly
answered
all
questions
on
these
points
and
reports
of
the
daily
examinations
were
published
still
another
and
another
and
yet
another
creditor
would
haul
me
up
and
his
attorney
would
ask
me
the
same
questions
which
had
already
been
answered
and
published
half
a
dozen
times
this
persistent
and
unnecessary
annoyance
created
considerable
sympathy
for
me
which
was
not
only
expressed
by
letters
i
received
daily
from
various
parts
of
the
country
but
the
public
press
with
now
and
then
an
exception
took
my
part
and
even
the
judges
before
whom
i
appeared
said
to
me
on
more
than
one
occasion
that
as
men
they
sincerely
pitied
me
but
as
judges
of
course
they
must
administer
the
law
after
a
while
however
the
judges
ruled
that
i
need
not
answer
any
question
propounded
to
me
by
an
attorney
if
i
had
already
answered
the
same
question
to
some
other
attorney
in
a
previous
examination
in
behalf
of
other
creditors
in
fact
one
of
the
judges
on
one
occasion
said
pretty
sharply
to
an
examining
attorney
this
sir
has
become
simply
a
case
of
persecution
barnum
has
many
times
answered
every
question
that
can
properly
be
put
to
him
to
elicit
the
desired
information
and
i
think
it
is
time
to
stop
these
examinations
i
advise
him
to
not
answer
one
interrogatory
which
he
has
replied
to
under
any
previous
these
things
gave
me
some
heart
so
that
at
last
i
went
up
to
the
sprouts
with
less
reluctance
and
began
to
try
to
pay
off
my
persecutors
in
their
own
coin
on
one
occasion
a
dwarfish
little
lawyer
who
reminded
me
of
quilp
commenced
his
examination
in
behalf
of
a
who
held
a
thousand
dollar
note
which
it
seemed
he
had
bought
for
seven
hundred
dollars
after
the
oath
had
been
administered
the
little
limb
of
the
law
arranged
his
pen
ink
and
paper
and
in
a
loud
voice
and
with
a
most
peremptory
and
supercilious
air
asked
what
is
your
name
sir
i
answered
him
and
his
next
question
given
in
a
louder
and
more
peremptory
tone
was
what
is
your
business
attending
bar
i
meekly
replied
attending
bar
he
echoed
with
an
appearance
of
much
surprise
attending
bar
why
don
t
you
profess
to
be
a
temperance
man
a
teetotaler
i
do
i
replied
and
yet
sir
do
you
have
the
audacity
to
assert
that
you
peddle
rum
all
day
and
drink
none
yourself
i
doubt
whether
that
is
a
relevant
question
i
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
i
will
appeal
to
his
honor
the
judge
if
you
don
t
answer
it
instantly
said
quilp
in
great
glee
i
attend
bar
and
yet
never
drink
intoxicating
liquors
i
replied
where
do
you
attend
bar
and
for
whom
was
the
next
question
i
attend
the
bar
of
this
court
nearly
every
day
for
the
benefit
of
lawyers
and
their
greedy
clients
i
answered
a
loud
tittering
in
the
vicinity
only
added
to
the
vexation
which
was
already
visible
on
the
countenance
of
my
interrogator
and
he
soon
brought
his
examination
to
a
close
on
another
occasion
a
young
lawyer
was
pushing
his
inquiries
to
a
great
length
when
in
a
half
laughing
apologetic
tone
he
said
you
see
barnum
i
am
searching
after
the
small
things
i
am
willing
to
take
even
the
crumbs
which
fall
from
the
rich
man
s
table
which
are
you
lazarus
or
one
of
the
dogs
i
asked
i
guess
a
would
not
smell
out
much
on
this
trail
he
said
adding
that
he
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
i
still
continued
to
receive
many
offers
of
pecuniary
assistance
which
whenever
proposed
in
the
form
of
a
gift
i
invariably
refused
in
a
number
of
instances
personal
friends
tendered
me
their
checks
for
and
other
sums
but
i
always
responded
in
substance
oh
no
i
thank
you
i
do
not
need
it
my
wife
has
considerable
property
besides
a
large
income
from
her
museum
lease
i
want
for
nothing
i
do
not
owe
a
dollar
for
personal
obligations
that
is
not
already
secured
and
when
the
clock
creditors
have
fully
investigated
and
thought
over
the
matter
i
think
they
will
be
content
to
divide
my
property
among
themselves
and
let
me
just
after
my
failure
and
on
account
of
the
of
my
wife
i
spent
a
portion
of
the
summer
with
my
family
in
the
farmhouse
of
charles
howell
at
westhampton
on
long
island
the
place
is
a
mile
west
of
quogue
and
was
then
called
the
thrifty
and
intelligent
farmers
of
the
neighborhood
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
summer
boarders
and
the
place
had
become
a
favorite
resort
howell
s
farm
lay
close
upon
the
ocean
and
i
found
the
residence
a
cool
and
delightful
one
surf
bathing
fishing
shooting
and
fine
roads
for
driving
made
the
season
pass
pleasantly
and
the
respite
from
active
life
and
immediate
annoyance
from
my
financial
troubles
was
a
very
great
benefit
to
me
our
landlord
was
an
eccentric
character
who
took
great
pleasure
in
showing
me
to
his
friends
and
neighbors
as
the
museum
man
and
consequently
as
a
great
curiosity
for
in
his
estimation
the
american
museum
was
chief
among
the
institutions
of
new
york
he
was
in
a
habit
of
gathering
shells
and
such
rarities
as
came
within
his
reach
which
he
took
to
the
city
and
disposed
of
at
the
museum
he
often
spoke
of
certain
phenomena
in
his
neighborhood
which
he
thought
would
take
well
with
the
public
if
they
were
properly
brought
out
one
day
he
said
mr
barnum
i
am
going
to
moriches
this
morning
and
i
want
you
to
go
along
with
me
and
see
a
great
curiosity
there
is
what
is
it
i
asked
it
is
a
man
who
has
got
a
natural
honk
replied
howell
and
it
is
worth
fifty
dollars
a
year
to
a
what
i
inquired
a
honk
a
honk
a
perfectly
natural
honk
he
makes
fifty
dollars
a
year
out
of
it
howell
reiterated
i
could
not
comprehend
what
a
honk
was
but
concluded
that
if
it
was
worth
fifty
dollars
a
year
among
the
long
island
fishermen
and
farmers
who
could
hardly
be
expected
to
pay
much
for
mere
it
would
be
much
more
valuable
to
exhibit
in
the
museum
so
i
remarked
that
as
i
was
authorized
by
greenwood
and
butler
to
purchase
curiosities
for
them
i
would
go
with
him
and
buy
the
honk
from
its
possessor
if
i
could
get
it
at
a
reasonable
price
buy
it
exclaimed
howell
i
guess
you
can
t
buy
it
you
don
t
seem
to
understand
me
the
man
has
got
a
natural
honk
i
tell
you
that
is
he
honks
exactly
like
a
wild
goose
when
flocks
are
flying
over
he
goes
out
and
honks
and
the
geese
supposing
that
some
goose
has
settled
and
is
honking
for
the
rest
of
the
flock
to
come
down
and
feed
all
fly
towards
the
ground
and
he
lets
into
em
with
his
gun
thus
killing
a
great
many
and
in
this
way
his
honk
is
worth
fifty
dollars
a
year
to
him
and
perhaps
i
decided
not
to
attempt
to
buy
the
honk
but
my
eagerness
to
do
so
and
my
entire
ignorance
of
the
character
of
the
curiosity
furnished
food
for
laughter
to
howell
and
his
neighbors
for
a
long
time
one
morning
we
discovered
that
the
waves
had
thrown
upon
the
beach
a
young
black
whale
some
twelve
feet
long
it
was
dead
but
the
fish
was
hard
and
fresh
and
i
bought
it
for
a
few
dollars
from
the
men
who
had
taken
possession
of
it
i
sent
it
at
once
to
the
museum
where
it
was
exhibited
in
a
huge
refrigerator
for
a
few
days
creating
considerable
excitement
the
general
public
considering
it
a
big
thing
on
ice
and
the
managers
gave
me
a
share
of
the
profits
which
amounted
to
a
sufficient
sum
to
pay
the
entire
board
bill
of
my
family
for
the
season
this
incident
both
amused
and
amazed
my
long
island
landlord
well
i
declare
said
he
that
beats
all
you
are
the
luckiest
man
i
ever
heard
of
here
you
come
and
board
for
four
months
with
your
family
and
when
your
time
is
nearly
up
and
you
are
getting
ready
to
leave
out
rolls
a
black
whale
on
our
beach
a
thing
never
heard
of
before
in
this
vicinity
and
you
take
that
whale
and
pay
your
whole
bill
with
it
i
wonder
if
that
ain
t
providential
why
that
beats
the
natural
honk
all
to
pieces
this
was
followed
by
such
a
laugh
as
only
charles
howell
could
give
and
like
one
of
his
peculiar
sneezes
it
resounded
echoed
and
through
the
whole
neighborhood
soon
after
my
return
to
new
york
something
occurred
which
i
foresaw
i
thought
at
the
time
was
likely
indirectly
to
lead
me
out
of
the
wilderness
into
a
clear
field
again
and
indeed
it
eventually
did
so
strange
to
say
my
new
city
which
had
been
my
ruin
was
to
be
my
redemption
and
dear
east
bridgeport
which
plunged
me
into
the
slough
was
to
bring
me
out
again
dear
as
the
place
had
literally
proved
to
me
it
was
to
be
yet
dearer
in
another
and
better
sense
hereafter
the
now
gigantic
wheeler
wilson
sewing
machine
company
was
then
doing
a
comparatively
small
yet
rapidly
growing
business
at
watertown
connecticut
the
terry
barnum
clock
factory
was
standing
idle
almost
worthless
in
east
bridgeport
and
wheeler
wilson
saw
in
the
empty
building
the
situation
the
ease
of
communication
with
new
york
and
other
advantages
precisely
what
they
wanted
provided
they
could
procure
the
premises
at
a
rate
which
would
compensate
them
for
the
expense
and
trouble
of
removing
their
establishment
from
watertown
it
is
enough
to
say
here
that
the
clock
factory
was
sold
for
a
trifle
and
the
wheeler
wilson
company
moved
into
it
and
speedily
enlarged
it
i
felt
then
that
this
was
providential
the
fact
that
the
empty
building
could
be
cheaply
purchased
was
the
main
motive
for
the
removal
of
this
watertown
enterprise
to
east
bridgeport
and
was
one
of
the
first
indications
that
my
failure
might
prove
a
blessing
in
it
was
a
fresh
impulse
towards
the
building
up
of
the
new
city
and
the
consequent
increase
of
the
value
of
the
land
belonging
to
my
estate
many
persons
did
not
see
these
things
in
the
same
light
in
which
they
were
presented
to
me
but
i
had
so
long
pondered
upon
the
various
means
which
were
to
make
the
new
city
prosperous
that
i
was
quick
to
catch
any
indication
which
promised
benefit
to
east
bridgeport
this
important
movement
of
the
wheeler
and
wilson
company
gave
me
the
greatest
hope
and
moreover
wheeler
kindly
offered
me
a
loan
of
without
security
and
as
i
was
anxious
to
have
it
used
in
purchasing
the
east
bridgeport
property
when
sold
at
public
auction
by
my
assignees
and
also
in
taking
up
such
clock
notes
as
could
be
bought
at
a
reasonable
percentage
i
accepted
the
offer
and
borrowed
the
this
sum
with
many
thousand
dollars
more
belonging
to
my
wife
was
devoted
to
these
purposes
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
now
got
hold
of
the
thread
which
would
eventually
lead
me
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
financial
difficulty
in
which
the
jerome
entanglement
had
involved
me
though
the
new
plan
promised
relief
and
actually
did
succeed
even
beyond
my
most
sanguine
expectations
eventually
putting
more
money
into
my
pocket
than
the
jerome
complication
had
taken
out
yet
i
also
foresaw
that
the
process
would
necessarily
be
very
slow
in
fact
two
years
afterwards
i
had
made
very
little
progress
but
i
concluded
to
let
the
new
venture
work
out
itself
and
it
would
go
on
as
well
without
my
personal
presence
and
attention
perhaps
even
better
growing
trees
money
at
interest
and
rapidly
rising
real
estate
work
for
their
owners
all
night
as
well
as
all
day
sundays
included
and
when
the
proprietors
are
asleep
or
away
and
with
the
design
of
coÃ¶perating
in
the
new
accumulation
and
of
saving
something
to
add
to
the
amount
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
europe
again
i
was
anxious
for
a
change
of
scene
and
for
active
employment
and
equally
desirous
of
getting
away
from
the
immediate
pressure
of
troubles
which
no
effort
on
my
part
could
then
remove
while
my
affairs
were
working
out
themselves
in
their
own
way
and
in
the
speediest
manner
possible
i
might
be
doing
something
for
myself
and
for
my
family
accordingly
leaving
all
my
business
affairs
at
home
in
the
hands
of
my
friends
early
in
i
set
sail
once
more
for
england
taking
with
me
general
tom
thumb
and
also
little
cordelia
howard
and
her
parents
this
young
girl
had
attained
an
extended
reputation
for
her
artistic
personation
of
little
eva
in
the
play
of
uncle
tom
and
she
displayed
a
precocious
talent
in
her
rendering
of
other
juvenile
characters
with
these
attractions
and
with
what
else
i
might
be
able
to
do
myself
i
determined
to
make
as
much
money
as
i
could
intending
to
remit
the
same
to
my
wife
s
friends
for
the
purpose
of
repurchasing
a
portion
of
my
estate
when
it
was
offered
at
auction
and
of
redeeming
such
of
the
clock
notes
as
could
be
obtained

reasonable

to
repeat
the
first
order
i
ever
gave
him
to
wit
fried
soles
and
shrimp
and
among
my
many
friends
in
liverpool
and
london
but
one
death
had
occurred
and
with
only
two
exceptions
they
all
lived
in
the
same
buildings
and
pursued
the
same
vocations
as
when
i
left
them
in
when
i
reached
london
i
found
one
of
these
exceptions
to
be
albert
smith
who
when
i
first
knew
him
was
a
dentist
a
literary
hack
a
contributor
to
and
a
writer
for
the
magazines
and
who
was
now
transformed
to
a
showman
in
the
full
tide
of
success
in
my
own
old
exhibition
quarters
in
egyptian
hall
piccadilly
a
year
or
two
before
he
had
succeeded
in
reaching
the
top
of
mont
blanc
and
after
publishing
a
most
interesting
account
which
was
and
translated
into
several
languages
the
whole
world
over
he
concluded
to
make
further
use
of
his
expedition
by
adapting
it
to
a
popular
entertainment
he
therefore
illustrated
his
ascent
by
means
of
a
finely
painted
and
accurate
panorama
and
he
accompanied
the
exhibition
with
a
descriptive
lecture
full
of
amusing
and
interesting
incidents
illustrative
of
his
remarkable
experiences
in
accomplishing
the
difficult
ascent
he
also
gave
a
and
exciting
narrative
of
his
entire
journey
from
london
to
switzerland
and
back
again
including
his
trip
up
and
down
the
rhine
and
introducing
the
many
peculiar
characters
of
both
sexes
he
claimed
to
have
met
at
different
points
during
his
tour
these
he
imitated
and
presented
in
so
a
manner
as
to
fairly
captivate
and
convulse
his
audiences
it
was
one
of
the
most
pleasing
and
popular
entertainments
ever
presented
in
london
and
was
immensely
remunerative
to
the
projector
resulting
indeed
in
a
very
handsome
fortune
the
entertainments
were
patronized
by
the
most
cultivated
classes
for
information
was
blended
with
amusement
and
in
no
exhibition
then
in
london
was
there
so
much
genuine
fun
two
or
three
times
albert
smith
was
commanded
to
appear
before
the
queen
at
buckingham
palace
and
at
windsor
and
as
he
gave
his
entertainment
with
great
success
on
these
occasions
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
could
not
take
his
panorama
with
him
it
can
readily
be
imagined
that
the
frame
was
quite
as
good
as
the
picture
and
that
the
lecture
as
compared
with
the
panorama
admirable
as
both
were
was
by
no
means
the
least
part
of
the
calling
upon
albert
smith
i
found
him
the
same
kind
cordial
friend
as
ever
and
he
at
once
put
me
on
the
free
list
at
his
entertainment
and
insisted
upon
my
dining
frequently
with
him
at
his
favorite
club
the
garrick
the
first
time
i
witnessed
his
exhibition
he
gave
me
a
sly
wink
from
the
stage
at
the
moment
of
his
describing
a
scene
in
the
golden
chamber
of
ursula
s
church
in
cologne
where
the
old
sexton
was
narrating
the
story
of
the
ashes
and
bones
of
the
eleven
thousand
innocent
virgins
who
according
to
tradition
were
sacrificed
on
a
certain
occasion
one
of
the
characters
whom
he
pretended
to
have
met
several
times
on
his
trip
to
mont
blanc
was
a
yankee
whom
he
named
phineas
the
wink
came
at
the
time
he
introduced
phineas
in
the
cologne
church
and
made
him
say
at
the
end
of
the
sexton
s
story
about
the
virgins
bones
old
fellow
what
will
you
take
for
that
hull
lot
of
bones
i
want
them
for
my
museum
in
america
when
the
question
had
been
interpreted
to
the
old
german
he
exclaimed
in
horror
according
to
albert
smith
mine
gott
it
is
impossible
we
will
never
sell
the
virgins
bones
never
mind
replied
phineas
cutecraft
i
ll
send
another
lot
of
bones
to
my
museum
swear
mine
are
the
real
bones
of
the
virgins
of
cologne
and
burst
up
your
show
this
always
excited
the
heartiest
laughter
but
smith
knew
very
well
that
i
would
at
once
recognize
it
as
a
paraphrase
of
the
scene
wherein
he
had
figured
with
me
in
at
the
porter
s
lodge
of
warwick
castle
in
the
course
of
the
entertainment
i
found
he
had
woven
in
numerous
anecdotes
i
had
told
him
at
that
time
and
many
incidents
of
our
excursion
were
also
travestied
and
made
to
contribute
to
the
interest
of
his
description
of
the
ascent
of
mont
blanc
when
we
went
to
the
garrick
club
that
day
albert
smith
introduced
me
to
several
of
his
acquaintances
as
his
teacher
in
the
show
as
we
were
quietly
dining
together
he
remarked
that
i
must
have
recognized
several
old
acquaintances
in
the
anecdotes
at
his
entertainment
upon
my
answering
that
i
did
indeed
he
remarked
you
are
too
old
a
showman
not
to
know
that
in
order
to
be
popular
we
must
snap
up
and
localize
all
the
good
things
which
we
come
by
thus
engrafting
his
various
experiences
upon
this
mont
blanc
entertainment
albert
smith
succeeded
in
serving
up
a
salmagundi
feast
which
was
relished
alike
by
royal
and
less
distinguished
palates
at
one
of
the
egyptian
hall
matinees
albert
smith
espying
me
in
the
audience
sent
an
usher
to
me
with
a
note
of
invitation
to
dine
with
him
and
a
number
of
friends
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
entertainment
to
this
invitation
he
added
the
request
that
as
soon
as
he
concluded
his
lecture
i
should
at
once
come
to
him
through
the
small
door
under
the
stage
at
the
end
of
the
orchestra
and
by
thus
getting
ahead
of
the
large
crowd
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
composing
the
audience
we
should
save
time
and
reach
the
club
at
an
hour
for
an
early
dinner
as
soon
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
of
his
lecture
i
pushed
for
the
little
door
the
highly
distinguished
audience
which
on
this
occasion
was
mainly
made
up
of
ladies
meanwhile
slowly
progressing
towards
the
exits
while
the
orchestra
was
playing
them
out
with
selections
of
popular
music
closing
the
stage
door
behind
me
i
instantly
found
myself
enveloped
in
that
egyptian
darkness
which
was
peculiar
i
suppose
if
not
appropriate
to
that
part
of
egyptian
hall
i
could
hear
smith
and
his
assistants
walking
on
the
stage
over
my
head
but
i
dare
not
call
out
lest
some
nervous
duchess
or
countess
should
faint
under
the
apprehension
that
the
hall
was
on
fire
or
that
some
other
severe
disaster
threatened
groping
my
way
blindly
and
hitting
my
head
several
times
against
sundry
beams
at
last
to
my
joy
i
reached
the
knob
of
the
door
which
led
me
into
this
hole
but
to
my
dismay
it
had
been
locked
from
the
outside
in
feeling
about
however
i
discovered
a
couple
of
bell
pulls
both
of
which
i
desperately
jerked
and
heard
a
faint
tinkling
in
two
opposite
directions
next
i
heard
the
heavy
canvas
roll
down
rapidly
till
it
struck
the
stage
with
a
thud
then
the
music
in
the
orchestra
suddenly
ceased
and
i
could
readily
understand
by
the
shrieks
of
the
women
and
the
loud
protestations
of
masculine
voices
that
the
gas
had
been
turned
off
and
the
whole
house
left
in
darkness
this
was
followed
by
hurried
and
heavy
footsteps
on
the
stage
the
imprecations
of
stage
carpenters
and
gasmen
jargon
of
foreign
musicians
in
the
orchestra
and
the
earnest
voice
of
my
friend
smith
excitedly
exclaiming
who
rung
those
bells
why
are
we
all
left
in
the
dark
light
up
here
at
once
bless
my
soul
what
does
all
this
mean
i
was
amazed
yet
amused
and
half
alarmed
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
so
i
sat
still
on
a
box
which
i
had
stumbled
over
as
well
as
upon
afraid
to
move
or
put
out
my
hand
lest
i
might
touch
some
machinery
which
would
give
the
signal
for
thunder
and
lightning
or
an
earthquake
or
more
likely
a
mont
blanc
avalanche
restored
tranquillity
overhead
assured
me
that
the
gas
had
been
relighted
i
knew
smith
must
be
anxiously
awaiting
me
for
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
behind
time
when
so
important
a
matter
as
dinner
was
the
motive
of
the
appointment
something
desperate
must
be
done
so
i
carefully
groped
my
way
to
the
stage
door
again
and
with
a
strong
effort
managed
to
wrench
it
open
covered
with
dust
and
perspiration
i
followed
behind
the
rear
of
the
audience
and
found
smith
to
whom
i
narrated
my
experiences
brushes
water
and
towels
soon
put
me
once
more
in
presentable
condition
and
we
went
to
the
garrick
club
where
we
dined
with
several
gentlemen
of
note
smith
could
not
refrain
from
relating
my
mishaps
and
their
consequences
in
my
search
for
him
under
difficulties
and
worse
yet
under
his
stage
and
great
was
the
merriment
over
the
idea
that
an
old
manager
like
myself
should
so
lose
his
reckoning
in
a
place
with
which
he
might
well
be
supposed
to
be
perfectly
familiar
when
the
late
william
thackeray
made
his
first
visit
to
the
united
states
i
think
in
he
called
on
me
at
the
museum
with
a
letter
of
introduction
from
our
mutual
friend
albert
smith
he
spent
an
hour
with
me
mainly
for
the
purpose
of
asking
my
advice
in
regard
to
the
management
of
the
course
of
lectures
on
the
english
humorists
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
he
proposed
to
deliver
as
he
did
afterwards
with
very
great
success
in
the
principal
cities
of
the
union
i
gave
him
the
best
advice
i
could
as
to
management
and
the
cities
he
ought
to
visit
for
which
he
was
very
grateful
and
he
called
on
me
whenever
he
was
in
new
york
i
also
saw
him
repeatedly
when
he
came
to
america
the
second
time
with
his
admirable
lectures
on
the
four
georges
which
it
will
be
remembered
he
delivered
in
the
united
states
in
the
season
of
before
he
read
these
lectures
to
audiences
in
great
britain
my
relations
with
this
great
novelist
i
am
proud
to
say
were
cordial
and
intimate
and
now
when
i
called
upon
him
in
at
his
own
house
he
grasped
me
heartily
by
the
hand
and
said
mr
barnum
i
admire
you
more
than
ever
i
have
read
the
accounts
in
the
papers
of
the
examinations
you
underwent
in
the
new
york
courts
and
the
positive
pluck
you
exhibit
under
your
pecuniary
embarrassments
is
worthy
of
all
praise
you
would
never
have
received
credit
for
the
philosophy
you
manifest
if
these
financial
misfortunes
had
not
overtaken
i
thanked
him
for
his
compliment
and
he
continued
but
tell
me
barnum
are
you
really
in
need
of
present
assistance
for
if
you
are
you
must
be
not
in
the
least
i
replied
laughing
i
need
more
money
in
order
to
get
out
of
bankruptcy
and
i
intend
to
earn
it
but
so
far
as
daily
bread
is
concerned
i
am
quite
at
ease
for
my
wife
is
worth
or
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
with
evident
delight
well
now
you
have
lost
all
my
sympathy
why
that
is
more
than
i
ever
expect
to
be
worth
i
shall
be
sorry
for
you
no
during
my
stay
in
london
i
met
thackeray
several
times
and
on
one
occasion
i
dined
with
him
he
was
a
most
genial
gentleman
in
our
conversations
he
spoke
with
the
warmest
appreciation
of
america
and
of
his
numerous
friends
in
this
country
and
he
repeatedly
expressed
his
obligations
to
me
for
the
advice
and
assistance
i
had
given
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
lecturing
visit
to
the
united
states
the
late
charles
kean
then
manager
of
the
princess
s
theatre
in
london
was
also
exceedingly
polite
and
friendly
to
me
he
placed
a
box
at
my
disposal
at
all
times
and
took
me
through
his
theatre
to
show
me
the
stage
dressing
rooms
and
particularly
the
valuable
properties
he
had
collected
among
other
things
he
had
twenty
or
more
complete
suits
of
real
armor
and
other
costumes
and
appointments
essential
to
the
production
of
historical
plays
in
the
most
complete
and
authentic
manner
in
the
mere
matter
of
charles
kean
has
never
been
surpassed
otto
goldschmidt
the
husband
of
jenny
lind
also
called
on
me
in
london
he
and
his
wife
were
then
living
in
dresden
and
he
said
the
first
thing
his
wife
desired
him
to
ask
me
was
whether
i
was
in
want
i
assured
him
that
i
was
not
although
i
was
managing
to
live
in
an
economical
way
and
my
family
would
soon
come
over
to
reside
in
london
he
then
advised
me
to
take
them
to
dresden
saying
that
living
was
very
cheap
there
and
he
added
my
wife
will
gladly
look
up
a
proper
house
for
you
to
live
i
thankfully
declined
his
proffered
kindness
as
dresden
was
too
far
away
from
my
business
a
year
subsequent
to
this
a
letter
was
generally
published
in
the
american
papers
purporting
to
have
been
written
to
me
by
jenny
lind
and
proffering
me
a
large
sum
of
money
i
immediately
pronounced
the
letter
a
forgery
and
i
soon
afterwards
received
a
communication
from
a
young
reporter
in
philadelphia
acknowledging
himself
as
the
author
and
saying
that
he
wrote
it
from
a
good
motive
hoping
it
would
benefit
me
on
the
contrary
it
annoyed
me
exceedingly
my
old
friends
julius
benedict
and
giovanni
belletti
called
on
me
and
we
had
some
very
pleasant
dinners
together
when
we
talked
over
incidents
of
their
travels
in
america
among
the
gentlemen
whom
i
met
in
london
some
of
them
quite
frequently
at
dinners
were
george
augustus
sala
edmund
yates
horace
mayhew
alfred
bunn
lumley
of
her
majesty
s
theatre
buckstone
of
the
haymarket
charles

our
princely
countrymen
george
peabody
morris
the
manager
bates
of
baring
brothers
oxenford
dramatic
critic
of
the
london
ballard
the
american
dentist
and
many
other
eminent
persons
i
had
numerous
offers
from
professional
friends
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
who
supposed
me
to
be
in
need
of
employment
barney
williams
who
had
not
then
acted
in
england
proposed
in
the
kindest
manner
to
make
me
his
agent
for
a
tour
through
great
britain
and
to
give
me
of
the
profits
which
he
and
williams
might
make
by
their
acting
pettengill
of
new
york
the
newspaper
advertising
agent
offered
me
the
fine
salary
of
a
year
to
transact
business
for
him
in
great
britain
he
wrote
to
me
when
you
failed
in
consequence
of
the
jerome
clock
notes
i
felt
that
your
creditors
were
dealing
hard
with
you
that
they
should
have
let
you
up
and
give
you
a
chance
and
they
would
have
fared
better
and
i
wish
i
was
a
creditor
so
as
to
show
what
i
would
these
offers
both
from
williams
and
pettengill
i
was
obliged
to
decline
lumley
manager
of
pier
majesty
s
theatre
used
to
send
me
an
order
for
a
private
box
for
every
opera
night
and
i
frequently
availed
myself
of
his
courtesy
i
had
an
idea
that
much
money
might
be
made
by
transferring
his
entire
opera
company
which
then
included
piccolomini
and
titjiens
to
new
york
for
a
short
season
the
plan
included
the
charter
of
a
special
steamer
for
the
company
and
the
conveyance
of
the
entire
troup
including
the
orchestra
with
their
instruments
and
the
chorus
costumes
scores
and
properties
of
the
company
it
was
a
gigantic
scheme
which
would
no
doubt
have
been
pecuniarily
successful
and
lumley
and
i
went
so
far
as
to
draw
up
the
preliminaries
of
an
arrangement
in
which
i
was
to
share
a
due
proportion
of
the
profits
for
my
assistance
in
the
management
but
after
a
while
and
to
the
evident
regret
of
lumley
the
scheme
was
given
up
meanwhile
i
was
by
no
means
idle
cordelia
howard
as
little
eva
with
her
mother
as
the
inimitable
topsy
were
highly
successful
in
london
and
other
large
cities
while
general
tom
thumb
returning
after
so
long
an
absence
drew
crowded
houses
wherever
he
went
these
were
strong
spokes
in
the
wheel
that
was
moving
slowly
but
surely
in
the
effort
to
get
me
out
of
debt
and
if

was

in
either
of
these
exhibitions
if
it
had
been
possibly
some
of
the
clock
creditors
would
have
annoyed
me
but
i
busied
myself
in
these
and
in
other
ways
working
industriously
and
making
much
money
which
i
constantly
remitted
to

i
took
the
little
general
into
germany
going
from
london
to
paris
and
from
thence
to
strasbourg
and
i
had
not
been
in
paris
since
the
times
of
king
louis
philippe
and
while
i
noticed
great
improvements
in
the
city
in
the
opening
of
the
new
boulevards
and
the
erection
of
noble
buildings
i
could
see
also
with
sorrow
that
there
was
less
personal
liberty
under
the
emperor
napoleon
than
there
was
under
the
citizen
the
officials
were
overbearing
and
unnecessarily
rigid
in
their
exactions
the
police
were
and
intolerant
the
screws
were
turned
on
everywhere
i
had
a
lot
of
large
pictorial
placards
of
general
tom
thumb
which
were
merely
as
i
wished
only
to
forward
them
to
germany
to
be
used
as
advertisements
of
the
forthcoming
exhibitions
these
the
french
officers
determined
to
examine
in
detail
and
when
they
discovered
that
one
of
the
pictures
represented
the
general
in
the
costume
of
the
first
napoleon
the
whole
of
the
bills
were
seized
and
sent
to
the
prefecture
of
police
i
was
compelled
to
stay
three
days
in
paris
before
i
could
convince
the
prefect
of
police
that
there
was
no
treason
in
the
tom
thumb
pictures
i
was
very
glad
to
get
out
of
paris
with
my
baggage
and
taking
a
seat
in
the
express
train
on
the
paris
and
strasbourg
railway
i
soon
forgot
my
annoyances
one
would
suppose
that
by
this
time
i
had
had
enough
to
do
with
clocks
to
last
me
my
lifetime
but
passing
one
night
and
a
portion
of
a
day
at
strasbourg
i
did
not
forget
or
fail
to
witness
the
great
church
clock
which
is
nearly
as
famous
as
the
cathedral
itself
at
noon
precisely
a
mechanical
cock
crows
the
bell
strikes
figures
of
the
twelve
apostles
appear
and
walk
in
procession
and
other
extraordinary
evidences
of
wonderful
mechanical
art
are
daily
exhibited
by
this
curious
old
clock
from
strasbourg
we
went
to
i
had
been
abroad
so
much
that
i
could
understand
and
manage
to
speak
french
but
i
had
never
been
in
germany
and
i
did
not
know
six
words
of
the
language
of
that
country
as
a
consequence
i
dreaded
to
pass
the
at
kehl
nearly
opposite
strasbourg
and
the
first
town
on
the
german
border
at
that
point
when
the
diligence
stopped
at
this
place
i
fairly
trembled
i
knew
that
i
had
no
baggage
which
was
rightfully
subject
to
duty
as
i
had
nothing
but
my
necessary
clothing
and
the
package
of
placards
and
lithographs
illustrating
the
general
s
exhibitions
this
was
the
package
which
had
given
me
so
much
trouble
in
paris
and
as
the
official
was
examining
my
trunks
i
assured
him
in
french
that
i
had
nothing
subject
to
duty
but
he
made
no
reply
and
deliberately
handled
every
article
in
my
luggage
he
then
cut
the
strings
to
the
large
packages
of
show
bills
i
asked
him
in
french
whether
he
understood
that
language
he
gave
a
grunt
which
was
the
only
audible
sound
i
could
get
out
of
him
and
then
laid
my
show
bills
and
lithographs
on
his
scales
as
if
to
weigh
them
i
was
almost
distracted
when
an
english
gentleman
who
spoke
german
kindly
offered
to
act
as
my
interpreter
please
to
tell
him
said
i
that
those
bills
and
lithographs
are
not
articles
of
commerce
that
they
are
simply
my
english
friend
did
as
i
requested
but
it
was
of
no
use
the
officer
kept
piling
them
upon
his
scales
i
grew
more
excited
please
tell
him
i
give
them
away
i
said
the
translation
of
my
assertion
into
german
did
not
help
me
a
double
grunt
from
the
functionary
was
the
only
response
tom
thumb
meanwhile
jumped
about
like
a
little
monkey
for
he
was
fairly
delighted
at
my
worry
and
perplexity
finally
i
said
to
my
new
found
english
friend
be
good
enough
to
tell
the
officer
to
keep
the
bills
if
he
wants
them
and
that
i
will
not
pay
duty
on
them
any
he
was
duly
informed
of
my
determination
but
he
was
immovable
he
lighted
his
huge
dutch
pipe
got
the
exact
weight
and
marking
it
down
handed
it
to
a
clerk
who
copied
it
on
his
book
and
solemnly
passed
it
over
to
another
clerk
who
copied
it
on
still
another
book
a
third
clerk
then
took
it
and
copied
it
on
to
a
printed
bill
the
size
of
a
half
letter
sheet
which
was
duly
stamped
in
red
ink
with
several
official
devices
by
this
time
i
was
in
a
profuse
perspiration
and
as
the
document
passed
from
clerk
to
clerk
i
told
them
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
to
make
out
a
bill
for
i
would
not
pay
it
they
would
get
no
duty
and
they
might
keep
the
property
to
be
sure
i
could
not
spare
the
placards
for
any
length
of
time
for
they
were
exceedingly
valuable
to
me
as
advertisements
and
i
could
not
easily
have
duplicated
them
in
germany
but
i
was
determined
that
i
would
not
pay
duties
on
articles
which
were
not
merchandise
every
transfer
therefore
of
the
bill
to
a
new
clerk
gave
me
a
fresh
twinge
for
i
imagined
that
every
clerk
added
more
charges
and
every
charge
was
a
tighter
turn
to
the
vise
which
held
my
fingers
finally
the
last
clerk
defiantly
thrust
in
my
face
the
terrible
official
document
on
which
were
scrawled
certain
cabalistic
characters
signifying
the
amount
of
money
i
should
be
forced
to
pay
to
the
german
government
before
i
could
have
my
property
i
would
not
touch
it
but
resolved
i
would
really
leave
my
packages
until
i
could
communicate
with
one
of
our
consuls
in
germany
and
i
said
as
much
to
the
english
gentleman
who
had
kindly
interpreted
for
me
he
took
the
bill
and
examining
it
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
why
it
is
but
fifteen
kreutzers
he
said
how
much
is
that
i
asked
feeling
for
the
golden
sovereigns
in
my
pocket
sixpence
was
the
reply
i
was
astonished
and
delighted
and
as
i
handed
out
the
money
i
begged
him
to
tell
the
officials
that
illustration
customs
of
the
the
custom
house
charge
would
not
pay
the
cost
of
the
paper
on
which
it
was
written
but
this
was
a
very
fair
illustration
of
sundry
dealings
in
other
countries
as
well
as
in
germany
i
found
baden
a
delightful
little
town
cleaner
and
neater
than
any
city
i
had
ever
visited
i
learned
afterwards
that
benazet
the
lessee
of
the
kurasal
and
gambling
house
was
compelled
annually
to
expend
large
sums
for
keeping
the
streets
and
public
places
clean
indeed
he
could
well
afford
to
do
so
as
one
would
readily
perceive
upon
witnessing
the
vast
amounts
of
money
which
were
daily
lost
by
the
men
and
women
of
nearly
all
nations
upon
his
tables
of
roulette
and
et
the
town
has
all
the
characteristics
and
accompaniments
of
a
a
theatre
public
library
and
several
very
fine
hotels
the
springs
are
presumed
to
be
the
inducements
which
draw
hundreds
of
invalids
to
every
summer
but
the
gaming
tables
are
the
real
attractions
to
thousands
of
far
weaker
persons
who
spend
the
entire
season
in
gambling
it
is
no
unusual
thing
to
see
ladies
sitting
around
these
gaming
tables
betting
their
silver
and
gold
pieces
until
they
lose
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
dollars
while
men
frequently
invest
many
times
these
amounts
if
they
happen
to
be
winners
they
are
very
sure
to
be
tempted
to
try
again
and
thus
in
the
long
run
succumb
to
the
advantage
which
is
given
in
the
game
to
the
bankers
over
the
the
games
open
at
eleven
o
clock
every
morning
sundays
included
and
close
at
eleven
o
clock
at
night
players
have
been
known
to
sit
at
the
table
without
once
rising
even
to
eat
or
to
drink
through
the
entire
day
and
night
session
very
early
in
the
day
however
many
a
player
finds
himself
penniless
and
in
such
case
if
he
does
not
step
to
some
quiet
place
and
blow
his
brains
out
the
proprietor
of
the
hell
will
present
to
him
money
enough
to
carry
him
at
least
fifty
miles
from
a
few
days
before
my
arrival
a
young
lady
hung
herself
indeed
several
suicides
occur
in
all
the
german
spas
every
year
from
the
one
cause
ruin
by
gambling
but
so
callous
do
the
players
as
well
as
the
become
that
i
can
easily
credit
a
story
told
me
at
homburg
the
greatest
gambling
place
in
europe
a
frenchman
sitting
at
the
table
where
scores
of
others
were
betting
their
money
lost
his
last
sou
and
immediately
drew
a
razor
from
his
pocket
and
cut
his
throat
the
circumstance
was
scarcely
sufficient
to
induce
the
players
to
raise
their
eyes
from
the
cards
it
was
a
mere
incident
an
episode
in
matters
more
important
a
sheet
was
thrown
over
the
body
and
as
the
servants
quietly
removed
the
corpse
some
one
slipped
into
the
vacated
chair
the
dealer
crying
out
in
french
make
your
bets
gentlemen
and
the
play
went
on
as
usual
in
due
time
when
our
preliminary
arrangements
were
completed
the
general
s
attendants
carriage
ponies
and
liveried
coachman
and
footmen
arrived
at
and
were
soon
seen
in
the
streets
the
excitement
was
intense
and
increased
from
day
to
day
several
crowned
heads
princes
lords
and
ladies
who
were
spending
the
season
at
with
a
vast
number
of
wealthy
pleasure
seekers
and
travellers
crowded
the
saloon
in
which
the
general
exhibited
during
the
entire
time
we
remained
in
the
place
the
charges
for
admission
were
much
higher
than
had
been
demanded
in
any
other
city
some
time
before
i
left
america
i
received
several
letters
from
a
young
man
residing
in
the
black
forest
in
regard
to
a
wonderful
orchestrion
which
he
was
building
and
which
he
wished
to
sell
or
send
to
me
for
exhibition
when
he
saw
the
accounts
of
my
arrival
with
tom
thumb
at
he
announced
his
willingness
to
bring
his
orchestrion
and
set
it
up
in
that
place
so
that
i
could
see
and
hear
it
his
letter
was
forwarded
to
me
at
frankfort
and
i
replied
that
my
engagements
were
made
many
days
in
advance
that
my
time
was
invaluable
but
that
if
he
would
have
his
orchestrion
set
up
and
in
perfect
order
at
such
a
time
on
such
a
day
i
would
be
there
promptly
to
see
it
arriving
at
the
appointed
time
i
found
that
he
had
not
completed
his
work
the
beautiful
case
was
up
but
the
interior
was
unfinished
i
was
much
disappointed
but
not
nearly
so
much
so
as
was
the
orchestrion
builder
oh
barnum
said
he
i
have
worked
with
my
men
all
last
night
and
all
and
i
will
work
all
night
again
and
have
it
in
readiness
morning
if
you
will
only
stay
i
will
go
down
on
my
knees
to
you
yes
barnum
i
will
cut
off
one
of
my
fingers
for
you
if
you
will
only
but
i
could
not
wait
even
under
this
strong
and
certainly
extraordinary
inducement
and
was
obliged
to
return
to
my
engagements
without
hearing
the
orchestrion
which
i
afterwards
learned
was
sold
and
set
up
in
petersburg
from
we
went
to
other
celebrated
german
spas
including
ems
homburg
and
weisbaden
these
are
all
fashionable
gambling
as
well
as
watering
places
and
during
our
visits
they
were
crowded
with
visitors
from
all
parts
of
europe
our
exhibitions
were
attended
by
thousands
who
paid
the
same
high
prices
that
were
charged
for
admission
at
and
at
wiesbaden
among
many
distinguished
persons
the
king
of
holland
came
to
see
the
little
general
these
exhibitions
were
among
the
most
profitable
that
had
ever
been
given
and
i
was
able
to
remit
thousands
of
dollars
to
my
agents
in
the
united
states
to
aid
in
my
real
estate
and
to
assist
in
taking
up
such
clock
notes
as
were
offered
for
sale
a
short
but
very
remunerative
season
at
the
home
and
of
the
great
house
of
the
rothschilds
assisted
me
largely
in
carrying
out
these
purposes
there
was
the
greatest
difficulty
however
in
getting
permission
to
hold
our
exhibitions
in
frankfort
when
i
applied
for
a
permit
at
the
office
of
the
commissary
of
police
i
was
told
that
office
hours
were
ended
for
the
day
and
that
the
chief
official
who
alone
could
give
me
the
permit
had
gone
home
to
dinner
as
i
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
begin
i
went
to
the
residence
of
the
commissary
where
i
was
met
at
the
door
by
a
gorgeously
arrayed
flunkey
to
whom
i
stated
my
business
and
who
informed
me
that
i
could
on
no
account
see
the
distinguished
official
till
dinner
was
over
i
waited
one
hour
and
a
half
by
my
watch
for
that
mighty
man
to
dine
and
then
he
condescended
to
admit
me
to
his
presence
when
i
had
stated
my
business
he
demanded
to
know
why
i
had
not
applied
to
him
at
his
office
in
the
proper
hours
declaring
that
he
would
do
no
business
with
me
at
his
house
and
that
i
must
come
to
him
i
went
and
after
a
great
deal
of
questioning
and
delay
i
received
the
license
to
exhibit
but
i
have
never
seen
more
wound
up
on
a
single
reel
all
my
men
all
tom
thumb
s
attendants
the
general
and
myself
in
addition
to
showing
our
passports
were
obliged
to
register
our
names
ages
occupations
and
what
not
in
a
huge
book
and
to
answer
all
sorts
of
questions
at
last
we
were
permitted
to
go
and
we
opened
our
doors
to
the
throng
that
came
to
see
the
general
but
a
day
or
two
after
our
exhibitions
began
came
a
messenger
with
a
command
that
i
should
appear
before
the
commissary
of
police
i
was
very
much
frightened
i
confess
i
was
sure
that
some
of
my
men
had
been
doing
or
saying
something
which
had
offended
the
authorities
and
although
i
was
conscious
that
my
own
conduct
had
been
circumspect
i
started
for
the
police
office
in
fear
and
trembling
on
the
way
i
met
henry
raymond
editor
of
the
york
who
was
in
company
with
a
gentleman
from
ohio
to
whom
he
introduced
me
and
thereupon
i
stated
my
trouble
and
my
opinion
that
i
was
about
to
be
fined
imprisoned
possibly
beheaded
i
knew
not
what
don
t
be
alarmed
said
raymond
we
will
keep
an
eye
on
the
proceedings
and
if
you
get
into
trouble
we
will
try
to
get
you
arriving
at
i
was
solemnly
shown
into
the
private
office
of
the
commissary
who
asked
me
to
be
seated
and
then
rose
and
locked
the
door
this
movement
was
by
no
means
calculated
to
calm
my
agitation
and
i
at
once
exclaimed
in
the
best
french
i
could
summon
sir
i
demand
an
we
do
not
need
one
he
replied
i
can
understand
your
french
and
you
can
understand
mine
i
wish
to
consult
you
confidentially
on
a
very
private
matter
and
one
that
concerns
me
somewhat
reassured
at
this
remarkable
announcement
i
begged
him
to
proceed
which
he
did
as
follows
do
not
be
uneasy
sir
as
this
matter
wholly
affects
me
i
must
state
to
you
in
entire
secrecy
that
the
half
of
my
whole
fortune
is
invested
in
the
bonds
of
one
of
your
american
railways
giving
me
the
name
of
the
road
and
as
i
have
received
no
interest
for
a
long
time
i
am
naturally
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
my
property
i
wish
to
know
if
the
road
is
good
for
anything
and
if
so
why
the
interest
on
the
bonds
is
not
i
was
happy
to
tell
him
that
i
had
met
that
very
morning
a
gentleman
from
ohio
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
this
road
which
was
in
his
vicinity
at
home
and
that
i
would
speedily
derive
from
him
the
desired
information
the
commissary
overwhelmed
me
with
profuse
thanks
adding
remember
the
half
of
my
entire
fortune
is
at
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
loss
he
might
be
called
upon
to
suffer
i
ventured
as
i
was
going
out
to
ask
him
the
amount
of
his
investment
four
thousand
dollars
was
the
reply
when
i
thought
of
his
liveried
lackeys
his
house
his
style
his
dignity
and
his
enormous
consequence
i
could
not
but
smile
to
think
that
all
these
things
were
supported
on
his
small
salary
and
an
entire
fortune
of
of
which
was
invested
in
the
bonds
of
a
doubtful
american
railway
company
we
exhibited
at
mayence
and
several
other
places
in
the
vicinity
reaping
golden
harvests
everywhere
and
then
went
down
the
rhine
to
cologne
the
journey
down
the
river
was
very
pleasant
and
we
duly
did
the
scenery
and
lions
on
the
way
the
boats
were
very
with
sleeping
accommodations
and
one
night
as
i
saw
our
party
must
sit
up
i
suggested
that
we
should
play
a
social
game
of
euchre
if
we
could
get
the
cards
the
clerk
of
the
boat
was
prompt
in
affording
the
gratifying
intelligence
that
he
had
cards
to
sell
and
i
bought
a
pack
paying
him
a
good
round
price
immediately
thereafter
the
clerk
pocketing
the
money
stated
that
it
was
nine
o
clock
and
according
to
the
regulations
he
must
turn
out
all
the
lights
which
he
did
leaving
us
to
play
cards
if
we
wished
to
in
the
dark
the
slowness
of
the
boat
was
a
great
annoyance
and
on
one
occasion
i
said
to
the
captain
look
here
confound
your
slow
old
boat
i
have
a
great
mind
to
put
on
an
opposition
american
line
and
burst
up
your
he
knew
me
and
knew
something
of
yankee
enterprise
and
he
was
evidently
alarmed
but
a
thought
came
to
his
relief
you
can
not
do
it
he
triumphantly
exclaimed
the
government
will
not
permit
you
to
run
more
than
nine
miles
an
we
remained
at
cologne
only
long
enough
to
visit
the
famous
cathedral
and
to
see
other
curiosities
and
works
of
art
and
then

i
have
ever

a

wonderful
dykes
which
are

of
whole
generations

holland
seems
to
me
the
most
curious
as
well
as
interesting
country
in
the
world
the
people
too
with
their
quaint
costumes
their
extraordinary
cleanliness
their
thrift
industry
and
frugality
pleased
me
very
much
it
is
the
universal
testimony
of
all
travellers
that
the
hollanders
are
the
neatest
and
most
economical
people
among
all
nations
so
far
as
cleanliness
is
concerned
in
holland
it
is
evidently
not
next
to
but
far
ahead
of
godliness
it
is
rare
indeed
to
meet
a
ragged
dirty
or
drunken
person
the
people
are
very
temperate
and
economical
in
their
habits
and
even
the
very
rich
and
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
wealth
in
the
country
live
with
great
frugality
though
all
of
the
people
live
well
as
for
the
scenery
i
can
not
say
much
for
it
since
it
is
only
diversified
by
thousands
of
windmills
which
are
made
to
do
all
kinds
of
work
from
grinding
grain
to
pumping
water
from
the
inside
of
the
dykes
back
to
the
sea
again
as
i
exhibited
the
general
only
in
rotterdam
and
amsterdam
and
to
no
great
profit
in
either
city
we
spent
most
of
our
time
in
rambling
about
to
see
what
was
to
be
seen
in
the
country
villages
it
seemed
as
if
every
house
was
scrubbed
twice
and
once
every
day
in
the
week
excepting
sunday
some
places
were
almost
painfully
pure
and
i
was
in
one
village
where
horses
and
cattle
were
not
allowed
to
go
through
the
streets
and
no
one
was
permitted
to
wear
their
boots
or
shoes
in
the
houses
there
is
a
general
and
constant
exercise
of
brooms
pails
floor
brushes
and
mops
all
over
holland
and
in
some
places
even
this
kind
of
thing
is
carried
so
far
i
am
told
that
the
only
trees
set
out
are
the
reason
i
think
why
our
exhibitions
were
not
more
successful
in
rotterdam
and
amsterdam
is
that
the
people
are
too
frugal
to
spend
much
money
for
amusement
but
they
and
their
habits
and
ways
afforded
us
so
much
amusement
that
we
were
quite
willing
they
should
give
our
entertainment
the
go
by
as
they
generally
did
we
were
in
amsterdam
at
the
season
of
kremis
or
the
annual
fair
which
is
held
in
all
the
principal
towns
and
where
shows
of
all
descriptions
are
open
at
prices
for
admission
ranging
from
one
to
five
pennies
and
are
attended
by
nearly
the
whole
population
for
the
people
generally
this
one
great
holiday
seems
for
the
whole
year
i
went
through
scores
of
booths
where
curiosities
and
monstrosities
of
all
kinds
were
exhibited
and
was
able
to
make
some
purchases
and
engagements
for
the
american
museum
among
these
was
the
albino
family
consisting
of
a
man
his
wife
and
son
who
were
by
far
the
most
interesting
and
attractive
specimens
of
their
class
i
had
ever
seen
we
visited
the
hague
the
capital
and
the
finest
city
in
holland
it
is
handsomely
and
regularly
laid
out
and
contains
a
beautiful
theatre
a
public
which
contains
some
of
the
best
works
of
vandyke
paul
potter
and
other
dutch
masters
while
the
museum
is
especially
rich
in
rarities
from
china
and
japan
when
we
arrived
at
the
hague
august
belmont
who
had
been
the
united
states
minister
at
that
court
had
just
gone
home
but
i
heard
many
encomiums
passed
upon
him
and
his
family
and
i
was
told
some
pretty
good
stories
of
his
familiarity
with
the
king
and
of
the
jolly
times
these
two
personages
frequently
enjoyed
together
i
did
not
miss
visiting
the
great
government
museum
as
i
wished
particularly
to
see
the
rich
collection
of
japan
ware
and
arms
made
during
the
many
years
when
the
dutch
carried
on
almost
exclusively
the
entire
foreign
trade
with
the
japanese
i
spent
several
days
in
minutely
examining
these
curious
manufactures
of
a
people
who
were
then
almost
as
little
known
to
nations
generally
as
are
the
inhabitants
of
the
planet
jupiter
on
the
first
day
of
my
visit
to
this
museum
i
stood
for
an
hour
before
a
large
case
containing
a
most
unique
and
extraordinary
collection
of
fabulous
animals
made
from
paper
and
other
materials
and
looking
as
natural
and
genuine
as
the
stuffed
skins
of
any
animals
in
the
american
museum
there
were
serpents
two
yards
long
with
a
head
and
pair
of
feet
at
each
end
frogs
as
large
as
a
man
with
human
hands
and
feet
turtles
with
three
heads
monkeys
with
two
heads
and
six
legs
scores
of
equally
curious
monstrosities
and
at
least
two
dozen
mermaids
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
looking
at
these
sirens
i
easily
divined
from
whence
the
fejee
mermaid
originated
while
i
was
standing
near
this
remarkable
cabinet
the
superintendent
of
the
museum
came
and
introducing
himself
to
me
asked
me
from
what
country
i
came
and
how
i
liked
the
museum
i
told
him
that
i
was
an
american
and
that
the
collection
was
interesting
and
remarkable
adding
you
seem
to
have
a
great
variety
of
mermaids
yes
he
replied
the
japanese
exercise
great
ingenuity
in
manufacturing
fabulous
animals
especially
mermaids
and
by
the
way
he
added
your
great
showman
barnum
is
said
to
have
succeeded
in
humbugging
the
americans
to
a
very
considerable
extent
by
means
of
what
he
claimed
to
be
a
veritable
i
said
that
such
was
the
story
though
i
believed
that
barnum
only
used
the
mermaid
as
an
advertisement
for
his
museum
perhaps
so
responded
the
superintendent
but
he
is
a
shrewd
and
industrious
manager
we
have
had
frequent
applications
from
his
european
agents
for
duplicates
from
our
collection
and
have
occasionally
sold
some
to
them
to
be
sent
to
the
superintendent
then
politely
asked
me
to
go
into
his
office
as
he
had
something
to
offer
me
which
as
an
american
gentleman
he
was
sure
i
would
prize
highly
but
the
business
was
of
a
strictly
confidential
character
he
asked
me
to
be
seated
and
cautiously
locking
the
door
and
drawing
his
chair
near
to
mine
he
informed
me
in
a
tone
scarcely
above
a
whisper
that
he
was
the
executor
of
the
estate
of
a
wealthy
gentleman
recently
deceased
with
power
to
dispose
of
the
property
which
included
a
large
number
of
exceedingly
valuable
ancient
and
modern
paintings
you
must
be
well
aware
he
continued
that
my
countrymen
would
be
extremely
unwilling
to
permit
these
precious
specimens
of
art
to
leave
holland
but
and
here
he
gave
my
hand
a
slight
but
most
friendly
squeeze
i
have
such
a
high
respect
i
might
almost
say
reverence
for
your
great
republic
that
i
am
only
too
happy
in
the
opportunity
now
afforded
me
of
allowing
you
to
take
a
very
few
of
these
fine
paintings
to
america
at
an
unprecedentedly
low
i
thought
he
was
a
little
too
generous
and
i
gave
him
what
the
irishman
called
an
evasive
answer
but
this
only
seemed
to
stimulate
him
to
further
efforts
to
effect
a
sale
so
he
turned
to
his
memorandum
book
and
pointed
out
the
names
of
gentlemen
from
boston
philadelphia
baltimore
and
new
orleans
who
had
ordered
one
or
more
cases
from
this
large
gallery
of
paintings
this
exhibition
was
conclusive
and
i
at
once
said
that
i
would
not
decide
to
purchase
till
i
returned
from
amsterdam
i
quite
understood
the
whole
thing
but
not
to
leave
my
anxious
friend
too
long
in
suspense
i
quietly
handed
my
card
to
him
remarking
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
that
name
his
cheeks
were
fairly
crimson
surely
said
he
you
are
not
barnum
of
the
new
york
museum
nobody
else
i
replied
with
a
laugh
he
stammered
out
an
apology
for
his
mermaid
remarks
but
i
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
in
a
friendly
way
telling
him
it
was
all
right
and
that
i
considered
it
a
capital
joke
this
him
and
we
then
had
a
very
pleasant
s
conversation
in
which
he
gave
me
several
valuable
hints
of
curiosities
to
be
procured
at
the
hague
and
elsewhere
in
holland
and
we
parted
good
friends
a
week
afterwards
a
young
gentleman
from
boston
introduced
himself
to
me
at
amsterdam
and
remarked
that
he
knew
i
was
there
for
he
had
been
so
informed
by
the
museum
superintendent
at
the
hague
and
by
the
by
he
added
as
soon
as
this
superintendent
discovered
i
was
from
america
he
told
me
if
i
would
go
into
his
office
he
would
show
me
the
greatest
curiosity
in
the
museum
i
went
and
he
pointed
to
the
card
of
p
barnum
which
he
had
conspicuously
nailed
up
over
his
desk
he
then
told
me
about
your
visit
to
the
museum
last
did
he
sell
you
any
paintings
i
asked
no
was
the
reply
but
he
informed
me
that
as
executor
of
an
estate
including
a
fine
gallery
he
could
sell
me
a
few
cases
at
a
very
low
price
mainly
on
account
of
his
high
regard
for
the
great
republic
to
which
i
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
estate
is
still
unsettled
and
that
a
few
of
the
valuable
paintings
if
cheap
dutch
artists
keep
up
the
supply
are
still
for
sale
to
the
public
generally
and
to
representatives
of
the
revered
republic
especially
undoubtedly
this
kind
of
business
will
continue
so
long
as
waterloo
relics
are
manufactured
at
birmingham
and
are
sent
to
be
plowed
in
and
dug
up
again
on
the
memorable
field
where
wellington
met
napoleon
and
how
many
very
worthy
persons
there
are
like
the
superintendent
of
the
hague
museum
who
have
been
terribly
shocked
at
the
story
of
the
fejee
mermaid
and
the
woolly
horse
after
a
truly
delightful
visit
in
holland
we
went
back
to
england
and
proceeding
to
manchester
opened
our
exhibition
for
several
days
the
hall
was
crowded
to
overflowing
at
each
of
the
three
and
sometimes
four
entertainments
we
gave
every
day
by
this
time
my
wife
and
two
youngest
daughters
had
come
over
to
london
and
i
hired
furnished
lodgings
in
the
suburbs
where
they
could
live
within
the
strictest
limits
of
economy
it
was
necessary
now
for
me
to
return
for
a
few
weeks
to
america
to
assist
personally
in
forwarding
a
settlement
of
the
clock
difficulties
so
leaving
the
little
general
in
the
hands
of
trusty
and
competent
agents
to
carry
on
the
exhibitions
in
my
absence
i
set
my
face
once
more
towards
home
and
the
west
and
took
steamer
at
liverpool
for
new
york
the
trip
like
most
of
the
passages
which
i
have
made
across
the
atlantic
was
an
exceedingly
pleasant
one
these
frequent
voyages
were
to
me
the
rests
the
reliefs
from
almost
unremitting
industry
anxiety
and
care
and
i
always
managed
to
have
more
or
less
fun
on
board
ship
every
time
i
crossed
the
ocean
during
the
present
trip
for
amusement
and
to
pass
away
the
time
the
passengers
got
up
a
number
of
mock
trials
which
afforded
a
vast
deal
of
fun
a
judge
was
selected
jurymen
drawn
prisoners
arraigned
counsel
employed
and
all
the
formalities
of
a
court
established
i
have
the
vanity
to
think
that
if
my
good
fortune
had
directed
me
to
that
profession
i
should
have
made
a
very
fair
lawyer
for
i
have
always
had
a
great
fondness
for
debate
and
especially
for
the
of
witnesses
unless
that
witness
was
barnum
in
examination
under
supplementary
proceedings
at
the
instance
of
some
who
had
bought
a
clock
note
at
a
discount
of
per
cent
in
this
mock
court
i
was
unanimously
chosen
as
prosecuting
attorney
and
as
the
court
was
established
expressly
to
convict
i
had
no
difficulty
in
carrying
the
jury
and
securing
the
punishment
of
the
prisoner
a
small
fine
was
generally
imposed
and
the
fund
thus
collected
was
given
to
a
poor
sailor
boy
who
had
fallen
from
the
mast
and
broken
his
leg
after
several
of
these
trials
had
been
held
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
passengers
secretly
put
their
heads
together
and
resolved
to
place
the
showman
on
trial
for
his
life
an
indictment
covering
twenty
pages
was
drawn
up
by
several
legal
gentlemen
among
the
passengers
charging
him
with
being
the
prince
of
humbugs
and
enumerating
a
dozen
special
counts
containing
charges
of
the
most
absurd
and
ridiculous
description
witnesses
were
then
brought
together
and
privately
instructed
what
to
say
and
do
two
or
three
days
were
devoted
to
arranging
this
mighty
prosecution
when
everything
was
ready
i
was
arrested
and
the
formidable
indictment
read
to
me
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
time
and
talent
had
been
brought
into
requisition
and
that
my
trial
was
to
be
more
elaborate
than
any
that
had
preceded
it
i
asked
for
half
an
hour
to
prepare
for
my
defence
which
was
granted
meanwhile
seats
were
arranged
to
accommodate
the
court
and
spectators
and
extra
settees
were
placed
for
the
ladies
on
the
upper
deck
where
they
could
look
down
see
and
hear
all
that
transpired
curiosity
was
on
for
it
was
evident
that
this
was
to
be
a
long
exciting
and
laughable
trial
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
judge
was
on
the
bench
the
jury
had
taken
their
places
the
witnesses
were
ready
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
four
in
number
with
pens
ink
and
paper
in
profusion
were
seated
and
everything
seemed
ready
i
was
brought
in
by
a
special
constable
the
indictment
read
and
i
was
asked
to
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
i
rose
and
in
a
most
solemn
manner
stated
that
i
could
not
conscientiously
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
that
i
had
in
fact
committed
many
of
the
acts
charged
in
the
indictment
but
these
acts
i
was
ready
to
show
were
not
criminal
but
on
the
contrary
worthy
of
praise
my
plea
was
received
and
the
first
witness
called
he
testified
to
having
visited
the
prisoner
s
museum
and
of
being
humbugged
by
the
fejee
mermaid
the
nurse
of
washington
and
by
other
curiosities
natural
and
unnatural
the
questions
and
answers
having
been
all
arranged
in
advance
everything
worked
smoothly
acting
as
my
own
counsel
i
the
witness
by
simply
asking
whether
he
saw
anything
else
in
the
museum
besides
what
he
had
mentioned
oh
yes
i
saw
thousands
of
other
were
they
curious
certainly
many
of
them
very
did
you
witness
a
dramatic
representation
in
the
museum
yes
sir
a
very
good
what
did
you
pay
for
all
this
that
will
do
sir
you
can
step
a
second
third
and
fourth
witness
were
called
and
the
examination
was
similar
to
the
foregoing
another
witness
then
appeared
to
testify
in
regard
to
another
count
in
the
indictment
he
stated
that
for
several
weeks
he
was
the
guest
of
the
prisoner
at
his
country
residence
iranistan
and
he
gave
a
most
amusing
description
of
the
various
schemes
and
contrivances
which
were
there
originated
for
the
purpose
of
being
carried
out
at
some
future
day
in
the
museum
how
did
you
live
there
asked
one
of
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
very
well
indeed
in
the
daytime
was
the
reply
plenty
of
the
best
to
eat
and
drink
except
liquors
in
bed
however
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
i
rose
the
first
night
struck
a
light
and
on
examination
found
myself
covered
with
myriads
of
little
bugs
so
small
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
by
using
my
microscope
i
discovered
them
to
be
infantile
bedbugs
after
the
first
night
i
was
obliged
to
sleep
in
the
in
order
to
escape
this
of
course
this
elicited
much
mirth
the
first
question
put
on
the
was
this
are
you
a
naturalist
sir
the
witness
hesitated
in
all
the
drilling
that
had
taken
place
before
the
trial
neither
the
counsel
nor
witnesses
had
thought
of
what
questions
might
come
up
in
the
and
now
not
seeing
the
drift
of
question
the
witness
seemed
a
little
bewildered
and
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
looked
puzzled
the
question
was
repeated
with
some
emphasis
no
sir
replied
the
witness
hesitatingly
i
am
not
a
then
sir
not
being
a
naturalist
dare
you
affirm
that
those
microscopic
insects
were
not
humbugs
instead
of
bedbugs
here
the
prisoner
was
interrupted
by
a
universal
shout
of
laughter
in
which
the
solemn
judge
himself
joined
and
if
they
were
humbugs
i
suppose
that
even
the
learned
counsel
opposed
to
me
will
not
claim
that
they
were
out
of
place
they
may
have
been
humbugs
replied
the
witness
that
will
do
sir
you
may
go
said
i
and
at
the
same
time
turning
to
the
array
of
counsel
i
remarked
with
a
smile
you
had
better
have
a
naturalist
for
your
next
witness
don
t
be
alarmed
sir
we
have
got
one
and
we
will
now
introduce
him
replied
the
counsel
the
next
witness
testified
that
he
was
a
planter
from
georgia
that
some
years
since
the
prisoner
visited
his
plantation
with
a
show
and
that
while
there
he
discovered
an
old
worthless
donkey
belonging
to
the
planter
and
bought
him
for
five
dollars
the
next
year
the
witness
visited
iranistan
the
country
seat
of
the
prisoner
and
while
walking
about
the
grounds
his
old
donkey
recognizing
his
former
master
brayed
whereupon
continued
the
witness
i
walked
up
to
the
animal
and
found
that
two
men
were
engaged
in
sticking
wool
upon
him
and
this
animal
was
afterwards
exhibited
by
the
prisoner
as
the
woolly
the
whole
court
spectators
and
even
the
prisoner
himself
were
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
gravity
with
which
the
planter
gave
his
very
ludicrous
testimony
what
evidence
have
you
i
inquired
that
this
was
the
same
donkey
which
you
sold
to
me
the
fact
that
the
animal
recognized
me
as
was
evident
from
his
braying
as
soon
as
he
saw
are
you
a
naturalist
sir
yes
i
am
replied
the
planter
with
firm
emphasis
as
much
as
to
say
you
can
t
catch
me
as
you
did
the
other
witness
oh
you
are
a
naturalist
are
you
then
sir
i
ask
you
as
a
naturalist
do
you
not
know
it
to
be
a
fact
in
natural
history
that
one
jackass
always
brays
as
soon
as
he
sees
another
this
question
was
received
with
shouts
of
laughter
in
the
midst
of
which
the
nonplussed
witness
backed
out
of
court
and
all
the
efforts
of
special
constables
and
even
the
high
sheriff
himself
were
unavailing
in
getting
him
again
on
the
witness
stand
this
trial
lasted
two
days
to
the
great
delight
of
all
on
board
after
my
success
with
the
naturalist
not
one
half
of
the
witnesses
would
appear
against
me
in
my
final
argument
i
sifted
the
testimony
analyzed
its
bearings
ruffled
the
learned
counsel
disconcerted
the
witnesses
flattered
the
judge
and
jury
and
when
the
judge
had
delivered
his
charge
the
jury
acquitted
me
without
leaving
their
seats
the
judge
received
the
verdict
and
then
announced
that
he
should
fine
the
naturalist
for
the
mistake
he
made
as
to
the
cause
of
the
donkey
s
braying
and
he
should
also
fine
the
several
witnesses
who
through
fear
of
the
had
refused
to
testify
the
trial
afforded
a
pleasant
topic
of
conversation
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
and
the
morning
before
arriving
in
port
a
vote
of
thanks
was
passed
to
me
in
consideration
of
the
amusement
i
had
intentionally
and
unintentionally
furnished
to
the
passengers
during
the
voyage
after
my
arrival
in
new
york
oftentimes
in
passing
up
and
down
broadway
i
saw
old
and
prosperous
friends
coming
but
before
i
came
anywhere
near
them
if
they
espied
me
they
would
dodge
into
a
store
or
across
the
street
or
opportunely
meet
some
one
with
whom
they
had
pressing
business
or
they
would
be
very
much
interested
in
something
that
was
going
on
over
the
way
or
on
top
of
the
city
hall
i
was
delighted
at
this
for
it
gave
me
at
once
a
new
sensation
and
a
new
experience
ah
ha
i
said
to
myself
my
butterfly
friends
i
know
you
now
and
what
is
more
to
the
point
if
ever
i
get
out
of
this
bewilderment
of
broken
i
shall
not
forget
you
and
i
heartily
thanked
the
old
clock
concern
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
learn
this
sad
but
most
needful
lesson
i
had
a
very
few
of
the
same
sort
of
experiences
in
bridgeport
and
they
proved
valuable
to
me
james
johnson
of
bridgeport
one
of
my
assignees
who
had
written
to
me
that
my
personal
presence
might
facilitate
a
settlement
of
my
affairs
told
me
soon
after
my
arrival
that
there
was
no
probability
of
disposing
of
iranistan
at
present
and
that
i
might
as
well
move
my
family
into
the
house
i
had
arrived
in
august
and
my
family
followed
me
from
london
in
september
and
october
my
second
daughter
helen
was
married
in
the
house
of
her
elder
sister
thompson
in
bridgeport
to
samuel
hurd
meanwhile
iranistan
which
had
been
closed
and
unoccupied
for
more
than
two
years
was
once
more
opened
to
the
carpenters
and
painters
whom
johnson
sent
there
to
put
the
house
in
order
he
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
best
to
keep
the
property
as
long
as
possible
and
in
the
interval
till
a
purchaser
for
the
estate
appeared
or
till
it
was
forced
to
auction
to
take
up
the
clock
notes
whenever
they
were
offered
the
workmen
who
were
employed
in
the
house
were
specially
instructed
not
to
smoke
there
but
nevertheless
it
was
subsequently
discovered
that
some
of
the
men
were
in
the
habit
occasionally
of
going
into
the
main
dome
to
eat
their
dinners
which
they
brought
with
them
and
that
they
stayed
there
awhile
after
dinner
to
smoke
their
pipes
in
all
probability
one
of
these
lighted
pipes
was
left
on
the
cushion
which
covered
the
circular
seat
in
the
dome
and
ignited
the
tow
with
which
the
cushion
was
stuffed
it
may
have
been
days
and
even
weeks
before
this
smouldering
tow
fire
burst
into
flame
i
was
staying
at
the
astor
house
in
new
york
when
on
the
morning
of
december
i
received
a
telegram
from
my
brother
philo
barnum
dated
at
bridgeport
and
informing
me
that
iranistan
was
burned
to
the
ground
that
morning
the
alarm
was
given
at
eleven
o
clock
on
the
night
of
the
and
the
fire
burned
till
one
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
my
beautiful
iranistan
was
gone
this
was
not
only
a
serious
loss
to
my
estate
for
it
had
probably
cost
at
least
but
it
was
generally
regarded
as
a
public
calamity
it
was
the
only
building
in
its
peculiar
style
of
architecture
of
any
pretension
in
america
and
many
persons
visited
bridgeport
every
year
expressly
to
see
iranistan
the
insurance
on
the
mansion
had
usually
been
about
but
i
had
let
some
of
the
policies
expire
without
renewing
them
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
fire
there
was
only
insurance
on
the
property
most
of
the
furniture
and
pictures
were
saved
generally
in
a
damaged
state
subsequently
my
assignees
sold
the
grounds
and
of
iranistan
to
the
late
elias
howe
the
celebrated
inventor
of
the
needle
for
the
property
brought
which
with
the
insurance
went
into
my
assets
to
satisfy
clock
creditors
it
was
howe
s
intention
to
erect
a
splendid
mansion
on
the
estate
but
his
untimely
and
lamented
death
prevented
the
fulfilment
of
the
plan
the
estate
in
was
to
be
divided
among
howe
s
three
children
and
in
all
probability
three
houses
will
be
built
upon
the
beautiful
grounds

boarding
with

early
in

and
took

to
all
the
principal
places
in
scotland
and
wales
giving
many
exhibitions
and
making
much
money
which
was
remitted
as
heretofore
to
my
agents
and
assignees
in
america
finding
after
a
while
that
my
personal
attention
was
not
needed
in
the
tom
thumb
exhibitions
and
confiding
him
almost
wholly
to
agents
who
continued
the
tour
through
great
britain
under
my
general
advice
and
instruction
i
turned
my
individual
attention
to
a
new
field
at
the
suggestion
of
several
american
gentlemen
resident
in
london
i
prepared
a
lecture
on
the
art
of
i
told
my
friends
that
considering
my
clock
complications
i
thought
i
was
more
competent
to
speak
on
the
art
of
money
losing
but
they
encouraged
me
by
reminding
me
that
i
could
not
have
lost
money
if
i
had
not
previously
possessed
the
faculty
of
making
it
they
further
assured
me
that
my
name
having
been
intimately
associated
with
the
jenny
lind
concerts
and
other
great
enterprises
the
lecture
would
be
sure
to
prove
attractive
and
profitable
the
old
clocks
ticked
in
my
ear
the
reminder
that
i
should
improve
every
opportunity
to
turn
an
honest
penny
and
my
lecture
was
duly
announced
for
delivery
in
the
great
james
hall
regent
street
piccadilly
it
was
thoroughly
advertised
a
feature
i
never
neglected
and
at
the
appointed
time
the
hall
which
would
hold
three
thousand
people
was
completely
filled
at
prices
of
three
and
two
shillings
and
fifty
cents
per
seat
according
to
location
it
was
the
evening
of
december
since
my
arrival
in
great
britain
the
previous
spring
i
had
spent
months
in
travelling
with
general
tom
thumb
and
now
i
was
to
present
myself
in
a
new
capacity
to
the
english
public
as
a
lecturer
i
could
see
in
my
audience
all
my
american
friends
who
had
suggested
this
effort
all
my
theatrical
and
literary
friends
and
as
i
saw
several
gentlemen
whom
i
knew
to
be
connected
with
the
leading
london
papers
i
felt
sure
that
my
success
or
failure
would
be
duly
chronicled
next
morning
there
was
moreover
a
general
audience
that
seemed
eager
to
see
the
showman
of
whom
they
had
heard
so
much
and
to
catch
from
his
lips
the
art
which
in
times
past
had
contributed
so
largely
to
his
success
in
life
stimulated
by
these
things
i
tried
to
do
my
best
and
i
think
i
did
it
the
following
is
the
lecture
substantially
as
it
was
delivered
though
it
was
interspersed
with
many
anecdotes
and
illustrations
which
are
necessarily
omitted
and
i
should
add
that
the
subjoined
copy
being
adapted
to
the
meridian
in
which
it
has
been
repeatedly
delivered
contains
numerous
local
allusions
to
men
and
matters
in
the
united
states
which
of
course
did
not
appear
in
the
original
draft
prepared
for
my
english
audiences
the
art
of
money
getting
in
the
united
states
where
we
have
more
land
than
people
it
is
not
at
all
difficult
for
persons
in
good
health
to
make
money
in
this
comparatively
new
field
there
are
so
many
avenues
of
success
open
so
many
vocations
which
are
not
crowded
that
any
person
of
either
sex
who
is
willing
at
least
for
the
time
being
to
engage
in
any
respectable
occupation
that
offers
may
find
lucrative
employment
those
who
really
desire
to
attain
an
independence
have
only
to
set
their
minds
upon
it
and
adopt
the
proper
means
as
they
do
in
regard
to
any
other
object
which
they
wish
to
accomplish
and
the
thing
is
easily
done
but
however
easy
it
may
be
found
to
make
money
i
have
no
doubt
many
of
my
hearers
will
agree
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
keep
it
the
road
to
wealth
is
as
franklin
truly
says
as
plain
as
the
road
to
it
consists
simply
in
expending
less
than
we
earn
that
seems
to
be
a
very
simple
problem
micawber
one
of
those
happy
creations
of
the
genial
dickens
puts
the
case
in
a
strong
light
when
he
says
that
to
have
an
income
of
twenty
pounds
per
annum
and
spend
twenty
pounds
and
sixpence
is
to
be
the
most
miserable
of
men
whereas
to
have
an
income
of
only
twenty
pounds
and
spend
but
nineteen
pounds
and
sixpence
is
to
be
the
happiest
of
mortals
many
of
my
hearers
may
say
we
understand
this
this
is
economy
and
we
know
economy
is
wealth
we
know
we
can
t
eat
our
cake
and
keep
it
yet
i
beg
to
say
that
perhaps
more
cases
of
failure
arise
from
mistakes
on
this
point
than
almost
any
other
the
fact
is
many
people
think
they
understand
economy
when
they
really
do
not
true
economy
is
misapprehended
and
people
go
through
life
without
properly
comprehending
what
that
principle
is
some
say
i
have
an
income
of
so
much
and
here
is
my
neighbor
who
has
the
same
yet
every
year
he
gets
something
ahead
and
i
fall
short
why
is
it
i
know
all
about
he
thinks
he
does
but
he
does
not
there
are
many
who
think
that
economy
consists
in
saving
and
candle
ends
in
cutting
off
two
pence
from
the
laundress
bill
and
doing
all
sorts
of
little
mean
dirty
things
economy
is
not
meanness
the
misfortune
is
also
that
this
class
of
persons
let
their
economy
apply
in
only
one
direction
they
fancy
they
are
so
wonderfully
economical
in
saving
a
where
they
ought
to
spend
two
pence
that
they
think
they
can
afford
to
squander
in
other
directions
a
few
years
ago
before
kerosene
oil
was
discovered
or
thought
of
one
might
stop
over
night
at
almost
any
farmer
s
house
in
the
agricultural
districts
and
get
a
very
good
supper
but
after
supper
he
might
attempt
to
read
in
the
sitting
room
and
would
find
it
impossible
with
the
inefficient
light
of
one
candle
the
hostess
seeing
his
dilemma
would
say
it
is
rather
difficult
to
read
here
evenings
the
proverb
says
you
must
have
a
ship
at
sea
in
order
to
be
able
to
burn
two
candles
at
once
we
never
have
an
extra
candle
except
on
extra
these
extra
occasions
occur
perhaps
twice
a
year
in
this
way
the
good
woman
saves
five
six
or
ten
dollars
in
that
time
but
the
information
which
might
be
derived
from
having
the
extra
light
would
of
course
far
outweigh
a
ton
of
candles
but
the
trouble
does
not
end
here
feeling
that
she
is
so
economical
in
tallow
candles
she
thinks
she
can
afford
to
go
frequently
to
the
village
and
spend
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
for
ribbons
and
furbelows
many
of
which
are
not
necessary
this
false
economy
may
frequently
be
seen
in
men
of
business
and
in
those
instances
it
often
runs
to
writing
paper
you
find
good
business
men
who
save
all
the
old
envelopes
and
scraps
and
would
not
tear
a
new
sheet
of
paper
if
they
could
avoid
it
for
the
world
this
is
all
very
well
they
may
in
this
way
save
five
or
ten
dollars
a
year
but
being
so
economical
only
in
note
paper
they
think
they
can
afford
to
waste
time
to
have
expensive
parties
and
to
drive
their
carriages
this
is
an
illustration
of
franklin
s
saving
at
the
spigot
and
wasting
at
the
penny
wise
and
pound
in
speaking
of
this
class
of
people
says
they
are
like
the
man
who
bought
a
penny
herring
for
his
family
s
dinner
and
then
hired
a
coach
and
four
to
take
it
i
never
knew
a
man
to
succeed
by
practising
this
kind
of
economy
true
economy
consists
in
always
making
the
income
exceed
the
wear
the
old
clothes
a
little
longer
if
necessary
dispense
with
the
new
pair
of
gloves
mend
the
old
dress
live
on
plainer
food
if
need
be
so
that
under
all
circumstances
unless
some
unforeseen
accident
occurs
there
will
be
a
margin
in
favor
of
the
income
a
penny
here
and
a
dollar
there
placed
at
interest
goes
on
accumulating
and
in
this
way
the
desired
result
is
attained
it
requires
some
training
perhaps
to
accomplish
this
economy
but
when
once
used
to
it
you
will
find
there
is
more
satisfaction
in
rational
saving
than
in
irrational
spending
here
is
a
recipe
which
i
recommend
i
have
found
it
to
work
an
excellent
cure
for
extravagance
and
especially
for
mistaken
economy
when
you
find
that
you
have
no
surplus
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
yet
have
a
good
income
i
advise
you
to
take
a
few
sheets
of
paper
and
form
them
into
a
book
and
mark
down
every
item
of
expenditure
post
it
every
day
or
week
in
two
columns
one
headed
necessaries
or
even
comforts
and
the
other
headed
luxuries
and
you
will
find
that
the
latter
column
will
be
double
treble
and
frequently
ten
times
greater
than
the
former
the
real
comforts
of
life
cost
but
a
small
portion
of
what
most
of
us
can
earn
franklin
says
it
is
the
eyes
of
others
and
not
our
own
eyes
which
ruin
us
if
all
the
world
were
blind
except
myself
i
should
not
care
for
fine
clothes
or
it
is
the
fear
of
what
grundy
may
say
that
keeps
the
noses
of
many
worthy
families
to
the
grindstone
in
america
many
persons
like
to
repeat
we
are
all
free
and
equal
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
in
more
senses
than
one
that
we
are
born
free
and
equal
is
a
glorious
truth
in
one
sense
yet
we
are
not
all
born
equally
rich
and
we
never
shall
be
one
may
say
there
is
a
man
who
has
an
income
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
per
annum
while
i
have
but
one
thousand
dollars
i
knew
that
fellow
when
he
was
poor
like
myself
now
he
is
rich
and
thinks
he
is
better
than
i
am
i
will
show
him
that
i
am
as
good
as
he
is
i
will
go
and
buy
a
horse
and
buggy
no
i
can
not
do
that
but
i
will
go
and
hire
one
and
ride
this
afternoon
on
the
same
road
that
he
does
and
thus
prove
to
him
that
i
am
as
good
as
he
my
friend
you
need
not
take
that
trouble
you
can
easily
prove
that
you
are
as
good
as
he
is
you
have
only
to
behave
as
well
as
he
does
but
you
can
not
make
anybody
believe
that
you
are
as
rich
as
he
is
besides
if
you
put
on
these
airs
and
waste
your
time
and
spend
your
money
your
poor
wife
will
be
obliged
to
scrub
her
fingers
off
at
home
and
buy
her
tea
two
ounces
at
a
time
and
everything
else
in
proportion
in
order
that
you
may
keep
up
appearances
and
after
all
deceive
nobody
on
the
other
hand
smith
may
say
that
her
neighbor
married
johnson
for
his
money
and
everybody
says
she
has
a
nice
one
thousand
dollar
camel
s
hair
shawl
and
she
will
make
smith
get
her
an
imitation
one
and
she
will
sit
in
a
pew
right
next
to
her
neighbor
in
church
in
order
to
prove
that
she
is
her
equal
my
good
woman
you
will
not
get
ahead
in
the
world
if
your
vanity
and
envy
thus
take
the
lead
in
this
country
where
we
believe
the
majority
ought
to
rule
we
ignore
that
principle
in
regard
to
fashion
and
let
a
handful
of
people
calling
themselves
the
aristocracy
run
up
a
false
standard
of
perfection
and
in
endeavoring
to
rise
to
that
standard
we
constantly
keep
ourselves
poor
all
the
time
digging
away
for
the
sake
of
outside
appearances
how
much
wiser
to
be
a
law
unto
ourselves
and
say
we
will
regulate
our
by
our
income
and
lay
up
something
for
a
rainy
people
ought
to
be
as
sensible
on
the
subject
of
as
on
any
other
subject
like
causes
produce
like
effects
you
can
not
accumulate
a
fortune
by
taking
the
road
that
leads
to
poverty
it
needs
no
prophet
to
tell
us
that
those
who
live
fully
up
to
their
means
without
any
thought
of
a
reverse
in
this
life
can
never
attain
a
pecuniary
independence
men
and
women
accustomed
to
gratify
every
whim
and
caprice
will
find
it
hard
at
first
to
cut
down
their
various
unnecessary
expenses
and
will
feel
it
a
great
self
denial
to
live
in
a
smaller
house
than
they
have
been
accustomed
to
with
less
expensive
furniture
less
company
less
costly
clothing
fewer
servants
a
less
number
of
balls
parties
theatre
goings
carriage
ridings
pleasure
excursions
cigar
smokings
liquor
drinkings
and
other
extravagances
but
after
all
if
they
will
try
the
plan
of
laying
by
a
or
in
other
words
a
small
sum
of
money
at
interest
or
judiciously
invested
in
land
they
will
be
surprised
at
the
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
constantly
adding
to
their
little
pile
as
well
as
from
all
the
economical
habits
which
are
engendered
by
this
course
the
old
suit
of
clothes
and
the
old
bonnet
and
dress
will
answer
for
another
season
the
croton
or
spring
water
will
taste
better
than
champagne
a
cold
bath
and
a
brisk
walk
will
prove
more
exhilarating
than
a
ride
in
the
finest
coach
a
social
chat
an
evening
s
reading
in
the
family
circle
or
an
hour
s
play
of
hunt
the
slipper
and
blind
man
s
buff
will
be
far
more
pleasant
than
a
fifty
or
a
five
hundred
dollar
party
when
the
reflection
on
the
difference
in
cost
is
indulged
in
by
those
who
begin
to
know
the
pleasures
of
saving
thousands
of
men
are
kept
poor
and
tens
of
thousands
are
made
so
after
they
have
acquired
quite
sufficient
to
support
them
well
through
life
in
consequence
of
laying
their
plans
of
living
on
too
broad
a
platform
some
families
expend
twenty
thousand
dollars
per
annum
and
some
much
more
and
would
scarcely
know
how
to
live
on
less
while
others
secure
more
solid
enjoyment
frequently
on
a
twentieth
part
of
that
amount
prosperity
is
a
more
severe
ordeal
than
adversity
especially
sudden
prosperity
easy
come
easy
go
is
an
old
and
true
proverb
a
spirit
of
pride
and
vanity
when
permitted
to
have
full
sway
is
the
undying
canker
worm
which
gnaws
the
very
vitals
of
a
man
s
worldly
possessions
let
them
be
small
or
great
hundreds
or
millions
many
persons
as
they
begin
to
prosper
immediately
expand
their
ideas
and
commence
expending
for
luxuries
until
in
a
short
time
their
expenses
swallow
up
their
income
and
they
become
ruined
in
their
ridiculous
attempts
to
keep
up
appearances
and
make
a
i
know
a
gentleman
of
fortune
who
says
that
when
he
first
began
to
prosper
his
wife
would
have
a
new
and
elegant
sofa
that
sofa
he
says
cost
me
thirty
thousand
dollars
when
the
sofa
reached
the
house
it
was
found
necessary
to
get
chairs
to
match
then
carpets
and
tables
to
correspond
with
them
and
so
on
through
the
entire
stock
of
furniture
when
at
last
it
was
found
that
the
house
itself
was
quite
too
small
and
for
the
furniture
and
a
new
one
was
built
to
correspond
with
the
new
purchases
thus
added
my
friend
summing
up
an
outlay
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
caused
by
that
single
sofa
and
saddling
on
me
in
the
shape
of
servants
equipage
and
the
necessary
expenses
attendant
upon
keeping
up
a
fine
establishment
a
yearly
outlay
of
eleven
thousand
dollars
and
a
tight
pinch
at
that
whereas
ten
years
ago
we
lived
with
much
more
real
comfort
because
with
much
less
care
on
as
many
hundreds
the
truth
is
he
continued
that
sofa
would
have
brought
me
to
inevitable
bankruptcy
had
not
a
most
unexampled
tide
of
prosperity
kept
me
above
it
and
had
i
not
checked
the
natural
desire
to
cut
a
the
foundation
of
success
in
life
is
good
health
that
is
the
substratum
of
fortune
it
is
also
the
basis
of
happiness
a
person
can
not
accumulate
a
fortune
very
well
when
he
is
sick
he
has
no
ambition
no
incentive
no
force
of
course
there
are
those
who
have
bad
health
and
can
not
help
it
you
can
not
expect
that
such
persons
can
accumulate
wealth
but
there
are
a
great
many
in
poor
health
who
need
not
be
so
if
then
sound
health
is
the
foundation
of
success
and
happiness
in
life
how
important
it
is
that
we
should
study
the
laws
of
health
which
is
but
another
expression
for
the
laws
of
nature
the
closer
we
keep
to
the
laws
of
nature
the
nearer
we
are
to
good
health
and
yet
how
many
persons
there
are
who
pay
no
attention
to
natural
laws
but
absolutely
transgress
them
even
against
their
own
natural
inclination
we
ought
to
know
that
the
sin
of
ignorance
is
never
winked
at
in
regard
to
the
violation
of
nature
s
laws
their
infraction
always
brings
the
penalty
a
child
may
thrust
its
finger
into
the
flame
without
knowing
it
will
burn
and
so
suffers
repentance
even
will
not
stop
the
smart
many
of
our
ancestors
knew
very
little
about
the
principle
of
ventilation
they
did
not
know
much
about
oxygen
whatever
other
gin
they
might
have
been
acquainted
with
and
consequently
they
built
their
houses
with
little
feet
bedrooms
and
these
good
old
pious
puritans
would
lock
themselves
up
in
one
of
these
cells
say
their
prayers
and
go
to
bed
in
the
morning
they
would
devoutly
return
thanks
for
the
preservation
of
their
lives
during
the
night
and
nobody
had
better
reason
to
be
thankful
probably
some
big
crack
in
the
window
or
in
the
door
let
in
a
little
fresh
air
and
thus
saved
them
many
persons
knowingly
violate
the
laws
of
nature
against
their
better
impulses
for
the
sake
of
fashion
for
instance
there
is
one
thing
that
nothing
living
except
a
vile
worm
ever
naturally
loved
and
that
is
tobacco
yet
how
many
persons
there
are
who
deliberately
train
an
unnatural
appetite
and
overcome
this
implanted
aversion
for
tobacco
to
such
a
degree
that
they
get
to
love
it
they
have
got
hold
of
a
poisonous
filthy
weed
or
rather
that
takes
a
firm
hold
of
them
here
are
married
men
who
run
about
spitting
tobacco
juice
on
the
carpet
and
floors
and
sometimes
even
upon
their
wives
besides
they
do
not
kick
their
wives
out
of
doors
like
drunken
men
but
their
wives
i
have
no
doubt
often
wish
they
were
outside
of
the
house
another
perilous
feature
is
that
this
artificial
appetite
like
jealousy
grows
by
what
it
feeds
on
when
you
love
that
which
is
unnatural
a
stronger
appetite
is
created
for
the
hurtful
thing
than
the
natural
desire
for
what
is
harmless
there
is
an
old
proverb
which
says
that
habit
is
second
nature
but
an
artificial
habit
is
stronger
than
nature
take
for
instance
an
old
his
love
for
the
quid
is
stronger
than
his
love
for
any
particular
kind
of
food
he
can
give
up
roast
beef
easier
than
give
up
the
weed
young
lads
regret
that
they
are
not
men
they
would
like
to
go
to
bed
boys
and
wake
up
men
and
to
accomplish
this
they
copy
the
bad
habits
of
their
seniors
little
tommy
and
johnny
see
their
fathers
or
uncles
smoke
a
pipe
and
they
say
if
i
could
only
do
that
i
would
be
a
man
too
uncle
john
has
gone
out
and
left
his
pipe
of
tobacco
let
us
try
they
take
a
match
and
light
it
and
then
puff
away
we
will
learn
to
smoke
do
you
like
it
johnny
that
lad
dolefully
replies
not
very
much
it
tastes
bitter
by
and
by
he
grows
pale
but
he
persists
and
he
soon
offers
up
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
fashion
but
the
boys
stick
to
it
and
persevere
until
at
last
they
conquer
their
natural
appetites
and
become
the
victims
of
acquired
tastes
i
speak
by
the
book
for
i
have
noticed
its
effects
on
myself
having
gone
so
far
as
to
smoke
ten
or
fifteen
cigars
a
day
although
i
have
not
used
the
weed
during
the
last
fourteen
years
and
never
shall
again
the
more
a
man
smokes
the
more
he
craves
smoking
the
last
cigar
smoked
simply
excites
the
desire
for
another
and
so
on
incessantly
take
the
in
the
morning
when
he
gets
up
he
puts
a
quid
in
his
mouth
and
keeps
it
there
all
day
never
taking
it
out
except
to
exchange
it
for
a
fresh
one
or
when
he
is
going
to
eat
oh
yes
at
intervals
during
the
day
and
evening
many
a
chewer
takes
out
the
quid
and
holds
it
in
his
hand
long
enough
to
take
a
drink
and
then
pop
it
goes
back
again
this
simply
proves
that
the
appetite
for
rum
is
even
stronger
than
that
for
tobacco
when
the
tobacco
chewer
goes
to
your
country
seat
and
you
show
him
your
grapery
and
fruit
house
and
the
beauties
of
your
garden
when
you
offer
him
some
fresh
ripe
fruit
and
say
my
friend
i
have
got
here
the
most
delicious
apples
and
pears
and
peaches
and
apricots
i
have
imported
them
from
spain
france
and
italy
just
see
those
luscious
grapes
there
is
nothing
more
delicious
nor
more
healthy
than
ripe
fruit
so
help
yourself
i
want
to
see
you
delight
yourself
with
these
things
he
will
roll
the
dear
quid
under
his
tongue
and
answer
no
i
thank
you
i
have
got
tobacco
in
my
his
palate
has
become
narcotized
by
the
noxious
weed
and
he
has
lost
in
a
great
measure
the
delicate
and
enviable
taste
for
fruits
this
shows
what
expensive
useless
and
injurious
habits
men
will
get
into
i
speak
from
experience
i
have
smoked
until
i
trembled
like
an
aspen
leaf
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
and
i
had
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
which
i
thought
was
heart
disease
till
i
was
almost
killed
with
fright
when
i
consulted
my
physician
he
said
break
off
tobacco
i
was
not
only
injuring
my
health
and
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
but
i
was
setting
a
bad
example
i
obeyed
his
counsel
no
young
man
in
the
world
ever
looked
so
beautiful
as
he
thought
he
did
behind
a
fifteen
cent
cigar
or
a
meerschaum
these
remarks
apply
with
force
to
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
to
make
money
requires
a
clear
brain
a
man
has
got
to
see
that
two
and
two
make
four
he
must
lay
all
his
plans
with
reflection
and
forethought
and
closely
examine
all
the
details
and
the
ins
and
outs
of
business
as
no
man
can
succeed
in
business
unless
he
has
a
brain
to
enable
him
to
lay
his
plans
and
reason
to
guide
him
in
their
execution
so
no
matter
how
bountifully
a
man
may
be
blessed
with
intelligence
if
the
brain
is
muddled
and
his
judgment
warped
by
intoxicating
drinks
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
carry
on
business
successfully
how
many
good
opportunities
have
passed
never
to
return
while
a
man
was
sipping
a
social
glass
with
his
friend
how
many
foolish
bargains
have
been
made
under
the
influence
of
the
nervine
which
temporarily
makes
its
victim
think
he
is
rich
how
many
important
chances
have
been
put
off
until
and
then
forever
because
the
wine
cup
has
thrown
the
system
into
a
state
of
lassitude
neutralizing
the
energies
so
essential
to
success
in
business
verily
wine
is
a
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
as
a
beverage
is
as
much
an
infatuation
as
is
the
smoking
of
opium
by
the
chinese
and
the
former
is
quite
as
destructive
to
the
success
of
the
business
man
as
the
latter
it
is
an
unmitigated
evil
utterly
indefensible
in
the
light
of
philosophy
religion
or
good
sense
it
is
the
parent
of
nearly
every
other
evil
in
our
country
don
t
mistake
your
the
safest
plan
and
the
one
most
sure
of
success
for
the
young
man
starting
in
life
is
to
select
the
vocation
which
is
most
congenial
to
his
tastes
parents
and
guardians
are
often
quite
too
negligent
in
regard
to
this
it
is
very
common
for
a
father
to
say
for
example
i
have
five
boys
i
will
make
billy
a
clergyman
john
a
lawyer
tom
a
doctor
and
dick
a
he
then
goes
into
town
and
looks
about
to
see
what
he
will
do
with
sammy
he
returns
home
and
says
sammy
i
see
is
a
nice
genteel
business
i
think
i
will
make
you
a
he
does
this
regardless
of
sam
s
natural
inclinations
or
genius
we
are
all
no
doubt
born
for
a
wise
purpose
there
is
as
much
diversity
in
our
brains
as
in
our
countenances
some
are
born
natural
mechanics
while
some
have
great
aversion
to
machinery
let
a
dozen
boys
of
ten
years
get
together
and
you
will
soon
observe
two
or
three
are
whittling
out
some
ingenious
device
working
with
locks
or
complicated
machinery
when
they
were
but
five
years
old
their
father
could
find
no
toy
to
please
them
like
a
puzzle
they
are
natural
mechanics
but
the
other
eight
or
nine
boys
have
different
aptitudes
i
belong
to
the
latter
class
i
never
had
the
slightest
love
for
mechanism
on
the
contrary
i
have
a
sort
of
abhorrence
for
complicated
machinery
i
never
had
ingenuity
enough
to
whittle
a
cider
tap
so
it
would
not
leak
i
never
could
make
a
pen
that
i
could
write
with
or
understand
the
principle
of
a
steam
engine
if
a
man
was
to
take
such
a
boy
as
i
was
and
attempt
to
make
a
watchmaker
of
him
the
boy
might
after
an
apprenticeship
of
five
or
seven
years
be
able
to
take
apart
and
put
together
a
watch
but
all
through
life
he
would
be
working
up
hill
and
seizing
every
excuse
for
leaving
his
work
and
idling
away
his
time
watch
making
is
repulsive
to
him
unless
a
man
enters
upon
the
vocation
intended
for
him
by
nature
and
best
suited
to
his
peculiar
genius
he
can
not
succeed
i
am
glad
to
believe
that
the
majority
of
persons
do
find
the
right
vocation
yet
we
see
many
who
have
mistaken
their
calling
from
the
blacksmith
up
or
down
to
the
clergyman
you
will
see
for
instance
that
extraordinary
linguist
the
learned
blacksmith
who
ought
to
have
been
a
teacher
of
languages
and
you
may
have
seen
lawyers
doctors
and
clergymen
who
were
better
fitted
by
nature
for
the
anvil
or
the
lapstone
select
the
right
after
securing
the
right
vocation
you
must
be
careful
to
select
the
proper
location
you
may
have
been
cut
out
for
a
hotel
keeper
and
they
say
it
requires
a
genius
to
know
how
to
keep
a
you
might
conduct
a
hotel
like
clockwork
and
provide
satisfactorily
for
five
hundred
guests
every
day
yet
if
you
should
locate
your
house
in
a
small
village
where
there
is
no
railroad
communication
or
public
travel
the
location
would
be
your
ruin
it
is
equally
important
that
you
do
not
commence
business
where
there
are
already
enough
to
meet
all
demands
in
the
same
occupation
i
remember
a
case
which
illustrates
this
subject
when
i
was
in
london
in
i
was
passing
down
holborn
with
an
english
friend
and
came
to
the
penny
they
had
immense
cartoons
outside
portraying
the
wonderful
curiosities
to
be
seen
all
for
a
being
a
little
in
the
show
line
myself
i
said
let
us
go
in
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
the
illustrious
showman
and
he
proved
to
be
the
sharpest
man
in
that
line
i
had
ever
met
he
told
us
some
extraordinary
stories
in
reference
to
his
bearded
ladies
his
albinos
and
his
armadillos
which
we
could
hardly
believe
but
thought
it
better
to
believe
it
than
look
after
the
he
finally
begged
to
call
our
attention
to
some
wax
statuary
and
showed
us
a
lot
of
the
dirtiest
and
filthiest
wax
figures
imaginable
they
looked
as
if
they
had
not
seen
water
since
the
deluge
what
is
there
so
wonderful
about
your
statuary
i
asked
i
beg
you
not
to
speak
so
satirically
he
replied
sir
these
are
not
madam
tussaud
s
wax
figures
all
covered
with
gilt
and
tinsel
and
imitation
diamonds
and
copied
from
engravings
and
photographs
mine
sir
were
taken
from
life
whenever
you
look
upon
one
of
those
figures
you
may
consider
that
you
are
looking
upon
the
living
glancing
casually
at
them
i
saw
one
labelled
henry
and
feeling
a
little
curious
upon
seeing
that
it
looked
like
calvin
edson
the
living
skeleton
i
said
do
you
call
that
henry
the
eighth
he
replied
certainly
sir
it
was
taken
from
life
at
hampton
court
by
special
order
of
his
majesty
on
such
a
he
would
have
given
the
hour
of
the
day
if
i
had
insisted
i
said
everybody
knows
that
henry
viii
was
a
great
stout
old
king
and
that
figure
is
lean
and
lank
what
do
you
say
to
that
why
he
replied
you
would
be
lean
and
lank
yourself
if
you
sat
there
as
long
as
he
there
was
no
resisting
such
arguments
i
said
to
my
english
friend
let
us
go
out
do
not
tell
him
who
i
am
i
show
the
white
feather
he
beats
he
followed
us
to
the
door
and
seeing
the
rabble
in
the
street
he
called
out
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
beg
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
respectable
character
of
my
visitors
pointing
to
us
as
we
walked
away
i
called
upon
him
a
couple
of
days
afterwards
told
him
who
i
was
and
said
my
friend
you
are
an
excellent
showman
but
you
have
selected
a
bad
he
replied
this
is
true
sir
i
feel
that
all
my
talents
are
thrown
away
but
what
can
i
do
you
can
go
to
america
i
replied
you
can
give
full
play
to
your
faculties
over
there
you
will
find
plenty
of
elbow
room
in
america
i
will
engage
you
for
two
years
after
that
you
will
be
able
to
go
on
your
own
he
accepted
my
offer
and
remained
two
years
in
my
new
york
museum
he
then
went
to
new
orleans
and
carried
on
a
travelling
show
business
during
the
summer
he
is
worth
sixty
thousand
dollars
simply
because
he
selected
the
right
vocation
and
also
secured
the
proper
location
the
old
proverb
says
three
removes
are
as
bad
as
a
fire
but
when
a
man
is
in
the
fire
it
matters
but
little
how
soon
or
how
often
he
removes
avoid
young
men
starting
in
life
should
avoid
running
into
debt
there
is
scarcely
anything
that
drags
a
person
down
like
debt
it
is
a
slavish
position
to
get
in
yet
we
find
many
a
young
man
hardly
out
of
his
teens
running
in
debt
he
meets
a
chum
and
says
look
at
this
i
have
got
trusted
for
a
new
suit
of
he
seems
to
look
upon
the
clothes
as
so
much
given
to
him
well
it
frequently
is
so
but
if
he
succeeds
in
paying
and
then
gets
trusted
again
he
is
adopting
a
habit
which
will
keep
him
in
poverty
through
life
debt
robs
a
man
of
his
self
respect
and
makes
him
almost
despise
himself
grunting
and
groaning
and
working
for
what
he
has
eaten
up
or
worn
out
and
now
when
he
is
called
upon
to
pay
up
he
has
nothing
to
show
for
his
money
this
is
properly
termed
working
for
a
dead
i
do
not
speak
of
merchants
buying
and
selling
on
credit
or
of
those
who
buy
on
credit
in
order
to
turn
the
purchase
to
a
profit
the
old
quaker
said
to
his
farmer
son
john
never
get
trusted
but
if
thee
gets
trusted
for
anything
let
it
be
for
manure
because
that
will
help
thee
pay
it
back
beecher
advised
young
men
to
get
in
debt
if
they
could
to
a
small
amount
in
the
purchase
of
land
in
the
country
districts
if
a
young
man
he
says
will
only
get
in
debt
for
some
land
and
then
get
married
these
two
things
will
keep
him
straight
or
nothing
this
may
be
safe
to
a
limited
extent
but
getting
in
debt
for
what
you
eat
and
drink
and
wear
is
to
be
avoided
some
families
have
a
foolish
habit
of
getting
credit
at
the
stores
and
thus
frequently
purchase
many
things
which
might
have
been
dispensed
with
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
i
have
got
trusted
for
sixty
days
and
if
i
don
t
have
the
money
the
creditor
will
think
nothing
about
there
is
no
class
of
people
in
the
world
who
have
such
good
memories
as
creditors
when
the
sixty
days
run
out
you
will
have
to
pay
if
you
do
not
pay
you
will
break
your
promise
and
probably
resort
to
a
falsehood
you
may
make
some
excuse
or
get
in
debt
elsewhere
to
pay
it
but
that
only
involves
you
the
deeper
a
good
looking
lazy
young
fellow
was
the
apprentice
boy
horatio
his
employer
said
horatio
did
you
ever
see
a
snail
i
think
i
have
he
drawled
out
you
must
have
met
him
then
for
i
am
sure
you
never
overtook
one
said
the
your
creditor
will
meet
you
or
overtake
you
and
say
now
my
young
friend
you
agreed
to
pay
me
you
have
not
done
it
you
must
give
me
your
you
give
the
note
on
interest
and
it
commences
working
against
you
it
is
a
dead
the
creditor
goes
to
bed
at
night
and
wakes
up
in
the
morning
better
off
than
when
he
retired
to
bed
because
his
interest
has
increased
during
the
night
but
you
grow
poorer
while
you
are
sleeping
for
the
interest
is
accumulating
against
you
money
is
in
some
respects
like
fire
it
is
a
very
excellent
servant
but
a
terrible
master
when
you
have
it
mastering
you
when
interest
is
constantly
piling
up
against
you
it
will
keep
you
down
in
the
worst
kind
of
slavery
but
let
money
work
for
you
and
you
have
the
most
devoted
servant
in
the
world
it
is
no
there
is
nothing
animate
or
inanimate
that
will
work
so
faithfully
as
money
when
placed
at
interest
well
secured
it
works
night
and
day
and
in
wet
or
dry
weather
i
was
born
in
the
blue
law
state
of
connecticut
where
the
old
puritans
had
laws
so
rigid
that
it
was
said
they
fined
a
man
for
kissing
his
wife
on
yet
these
rich
old
puritans
would
have
thousands
of
dollars
at
interest
and
on
saturday
night
would
be
worth
a
certain
amount
on
sunday
they
would
go
to
church
and
perform
all
the
duties
of
a
christian
on
waking
up
on
monday
morning
they
would
find
themselves
considerably
richer
than
the
saturday
night
previous
simply
because
their
money
placed
at
interest
had
worked
faithfully
for
them
all
day
sunday
according
to
law
do
not
let
it
work
against
you
if
you
do
there
is
no
chance
for
success
in
life
so
far
as
money
is
concerned
john
randolph
the
eccentric
virginian
once
exclaimed
in
congress
mr
speaker
i
have
discovered
the
philosopher
s
stone
pay
as
you
this
is
indeed
nearer
to
the
philosopher
s
stone
than
any
alchemist
has
ever
yet
arrived
when
a
man
is
in
the
right
path
he
must
persevere
i
speak
of
this
because
there
are
some
persons
who
are
born
tired
naturally
lazy
and
possessing
no
self
reliance
and
no
perseverance
but
they
can
cultivate
these
qualities
as
davy
crockett
said
this
thing
remember
when
i
am
dead
be
sure
you
are
right
then
go
it
is
this
this
determination
not
to
let
the
horrors
or
the
blues
take
possession
of
you
so
as
to
make
you
relax
your
energies
in
the
struggle
for
independence
which
you
must
cultivate
how
many
have
almost
reached
the
goal
of
their
ambition
but
losing
faith
in
themselves
have
relaxed
their
energies
and
the
golden
prize
has
been
lost
forever
it
is
no
doubt
often
true
as
shakespeare
says
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
if
you
hesitate
some
bolder
hand
will
stretch
out
before
you
and
get
the
prize
remember
the
proverb
of
solomon
he
becometh
poor
that
dealeth
with
a
slack
hand
but
the
hand
of
the
diligent
maketh
perseverance
is
sometimes
but
another
word
for
many
persons
naturally
look
on
the
dark
side
of
life
and
borrow
trouble
they
are
born
so
then
they
ask
for
advice
and
they
will
be
governed
by
one
wind
and
blown
by
another
and
can
not
rely
upon
themselves
until
you
get
so
that
you
can
rely
upon
yourself
you
need
not
expect
to
succeed
i
have
known
men
personally
who
have
met
with
pecuniary
reverses
and
absolutely
committed
suicide
because
they
thought
they
could
never
overcome
their
misfortune
but
i
have
known
others
who
have
met
more
serious
financial
difficulties
and
have
bridged
them
over
by
simple
perseverance
aided
by
a
firm
belief
that
they
were
doing
justly
and
that
providence
would
overcome
evil
with
you
will
see
this
illustrated
in
any
sphere
of
life
take
two
generals
both
understand
military
tactics
both
educated
at
west
point
if
you
please
both
equally
gifted
yet
one
having
this
principle
of
perseverance
and
the
other
lacking
it
the
former
will
succeed
in
his
profession
while
the
latter
will
fail
one
may
hear
the
cry
the
enemy
are
coming
and
they
have
got
got
cannon
says
the
hesitating
general
then
halt
every
he
wants
time
to
reflect
his
hesitation
is
his
ruin
the
enemy
passes
unmolested
or
overwhelms
him
the
general
of
pluck
perseverance
and
self
reliance
goes
into
battle
with
a
will
and
amid
the
clash
of
arms
the
booming
of
cannon
and
the
shrieks
of
the
wounded
and
dying
you
will
see
this
man
persevering
going
on
cutting
and
slashing
his
way
through
with
unwavering
determination
and
if
you
are
near
enough
you
will
hear
him
shout
i
will
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
takes
all
whatever
you
do
do
with
all
your
work
at
it
if
necessary
early
and
late
in
season
and
out
of
season
not
leaving
a
stone
unturned
and
never
deferring
for
a
single
hour
that
which
can
be
done
just
as
well
the
old
proverb
is
full
of
truth
and
meaning
whatever
is
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
many
a
man
acquires
a
fortune
by
doing
his
business
thoroughly
while
his
neighbor
remains
poor
for
life
because
he
only
half
does
it
ambition
energy
industry
perseverance
are
indispensable
requisites
for
success
in
business
fortune
always
favors
the
brave
and
never
helps
a
man
who
does
not
help
himself
it
won
t
do
to
spend
your
time
like
micawber
in
waiting
for
something
to
turn
to
such
men
one
of
two
things
usually
turns
up
the
or
the
jail
for
idleness
breeds
bad
habits
and
clothes
a
man
in
rags
the
poor
spendthrift
vagabond
said
to
a
rich
man
i
have
discovered
there
is
money
enough
in
the
world
for
all
of
us
if
it
was
equally
divided
this
must
be
done
and
we
shall
all
be
happy
but
was
the
response
if
everybody
was
like
you
it
would
be
spent
in
two
months
and
what
would
you
do
then
oh
divide
again
keep
dividing
of
course
i
was
recently
reading
in
a
london
paper
an
account
of
a
like
philosophic
pauper
who
was
kicked
out
of
a
cheap
because
he
could
not
pay
his
bill
but
he
had
a
roll
of
papers
sticking
out
of
his
coat
pocket
which
upon
examination
proved
to
be
his
plan
for
paying
off
the
national
debt
of
england
without
the
aid
of
a
penny
people
have
got
to
do
as
cromwell
said
not
only
trust
in
providence
but
keep
the
powder
do
your
part
of
the
work
or
you
can
not
succeed
mahomet
one
night
while
encamping
in
the
desert
overheard
one
of
his
fatigued
followers
remark
i
will
loose
my
camel
and
trust
it
to
no
no
not
so
said
the
prophet
tie
thy
camel
and
trust
it
to
god
do
all
you
can
for
yourselves
and
then
trust
to
providence
or
luck
or
whatever
you
please
to
call
it
for
the
rest
depend
upon
your
own
personal
the
eye
of
the
employer
is
often
worth
more
than
the
hands
of
a
dozen
employees
in
the
nature
of
things
an
agent
can
not
be
so
faithful
to
his
employer
as
to
himself
many
who
are
employers
will
call
to
mind
instances
where
the
best
employees
have
overlooked
important
points
which
could
not
have
escaped
their
own
observation
as
a
proprietor
no
man
has
a
right
to
expect
to
succeed
in
life
unless
he
understands
his
business
and
nobody
can
understand
his
business
thoroughly
unless
he
learns
it
by
personal
application
and
experience
a
man
may
be
a
manufacturer
he
has
got
to
learn
the
many
details
of
his
business
personally
he
will
learn
something
every
day
and
he
will
find
he
will
make
mistakes
nearly
every
day
and
these
very
mistakes
are
helps
to
him
in
the
way
of
experiences
if
he
but
heeds
them
he
will
be
like
the
yankee
who
having
been
cheated
as
to
quality
in
the
purchase
of
his
merchandise
said
all
right
there
s
a
little
information
to
be
gained
every
day
i
will
never
be
cheated
in
that
way
thus
a
man
buys
his
experience
and
it
is
the
best
kind
if
not
purchased
at
too
dear
a
rate
i
hold
that
every
man
should
like
cuvier
the
french
naturalist
thoroughly
know
his
business
so
proficient
was
he
in
the
study
of
natural
history
that
you
might
bring
to
him
the
bone
or
even
a
section
of
a
bone
of
an
animal
which
he
had
never
seen
described
and
reasoning
from
analogy
he
would
be
able
to
draw
a
picture
of
the
object
from
which
the
bone
had
been
taken
on
one
occasion
his
students
attempted
to
deceive
him
they
rolled
one
of
their
number
in
a
cow
skin
and
put
him
under
the
professor
s
table
as
a
new
specimen
when
the
philosopher
came
into
the
room
some
of
the
students
asked
him
what
animal
it
was
suddenly
the
animal
said
i
am
the
devil
and
i
am
going
to
eat
it
was
but
natural
that
cuvier
should
desire
to
classify
this
creature
and
examining
it
intently
he
said
divided
hoof
graminivorous
it
can
not
be
he
knew
that
an
animal
with
a
split
hoof
must
live
upon
grass
and
grain
or
other
kind
of
vegetation
and
would
not
be
inclined
to
eat
flesh
dead
or
alive
so
he
considered
himself
perfectly
safe
the
possession
of
a
perfect
knowledge
of
your
business
is
an
absolute
necessity
in
order
to
insure
success
among
the
maxims
of
the
elder
rothschild
was
one
an
apparent
paradox
be
cautious
and
this
seems
to
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
but
it
is
not
and
there
is
great
wisdom
in
the
maxim
it
is
in
fact
a
condensed
statement
of
what
i
have
already
said
it
is
to
say
you
must
exercise
your
caution
in
laying
your
plans
but
be
bold
in
carrying
them
a
man
who
is
all
caution
will
never
dare
to
take
hold
and
be
successful
and
a
man
who
is
all
boldness
is
merely
reckless
and
must
eventually
fail
a
man
may
go
on
change
and
make
fifty
or
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
speculating
in
stocks
at
a
single
operation
but
if
he
has
simple
boldness
without
caution
it
is
mere
chance
and
what
he
gains
he
will
lose
you
must
have
both
the
caution
and
the
boldness
to
insure
success
the
rothschilds
have
another
maxim
never
have
anything
to
do
with
an
unlucky
man
or
that
is
to
say
never
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
or
place
which
never
succeeds
because
although
a
man
may
appear
to
be
honest
and
intelligent
yet
if
he
tries
this
or
that
thing
and
always
fails
it
is
on
account
of
some
fault
or
infirmity
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
discover
but
nevertheless
which
must
exist
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
world
as
luck
there
never
was
a
man
who
could
go
out
in
the
morning
and
find
a
purse
full
of
gold
in
the
street
and
another
and
so
on
day
after
day
he
may
do
so
once
in
his
life
but
so
far
as
mere
luck
is
concerned
he
is
as
liable
to
lose
it
as
to
find
it
like
causes
produce
like
if
a
man
adopts
the
proper
methods
to
be
successful
luck
will
not
prevent
him
if
he
does
not
succeed
there
are
reasons
for
it
although
perhaps
he
may
not
be
able
to
see
them
use
the
best
men
in
engaging
employees
should
be
careful
to
get
the
best
understand
you
can
not
have
too
good
tools
to
work
with
and
there
is
no
tool
you
should
be
so
particular
about
as
living
tools
if
you
get
a
good
one
it
is
better
to
keep
him
than
keep
changing
he
learns
something
every
day
and
you
are
benefited
by
the
experience
he
acquires
he
is
worth
more
to
you
this
year
than
last
and
he
is
the
last
man
to
part
with
provided
his
habits
are
good
and
he
continues
faithful
if
as
he
gets
more
valuable
he
demands
an
exorbitant
increase
of
salary
on
the
supposition
that
you
can
t
do
without
him
let
him
go
whenever
i
have
such
an
employee
i
always
discharge
him
first
to
convince
him
that
his
place
may
be
supplied
and
second
because
he
is
good
for
nothing
if
he
thinks
he
is
invaluable
and
can
not
be
spared
but
i
would
keep
him
if
possible
in
order
to
profit
from
the
result
of
his
experience
an
important
element
in
an
employee
is
the
brain
you
can
see
bills
up
hands
wanted
but
hands
are
not
worth
a
great
deal
without
beecher
illustrates
this
in
this
wise
an
employee
offers
his
services
by
saying
i
have
a
pair
of
hands
and
one
of
my
fingers
that
is
very
good
says
the
employer
another
man
comes
along
and
says
he
has
two
fingers
that
ah
that
is
but
a
third
calls
in
and
says
that
all
his
fingers
and
thumbs
that
is
better
still
finally
another
steps
in
and
says
i
have
a
brain
that
thinks
i
think
all
over
i
am
a
thinking
as
well
as
a
working
man
you
are
the
man
i
want
says
the
delighted
employer
those
men
who
have
brains
and
experience
are
therefore
the
most
valuable
and
not
to
be
readily
parted
with
it
is
better
for
them
as
well
as
yourself
to
keep
them
at
reasonable
advances
in
their
salaries
from
time
to
time
don
t
get
above
your
young
men
after
they
get
through
their
business
training
or
apprenticeship
instead
of
pursuing
their
avocation
and
rising
in
their
business
will
often
lie
about
doing
nothing
they
say
i
have
learned
my
business
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
hireling
what
is
the
object
of
learning
my
trade
or
profession
unless
i
establish
myself
have
you
capital
to
start
with
no
but
i
am
going
to
have
how
are
you
going
to
get
it
i
will
tell
you
confidentially
i
have
a
wealthy
old
aunt
and
she
will
die
pretty
soon
but
if
she
does
not
i
expect
to
find
some
rich
old
man
who
will
lend
me
a
few
thousands
to
give
me
a
start
if
i
only
get
the
money
to
start
with
i
will
do
there
is
no
greater
mistake
than
when
a
young
man
believes
he
will
succeed
with
borrowed
money
why
because
every
man
s
experience
coincides
with
that
of
astor
who
said
it
was
more
difficult
for
him
to
accumulate
his
first
thousand
dollars
than
all
the
succeeding
millions
that
made
up
his
colossal
money
is
good
for
nothing
unless
you
know
the
value
of
it
by
experience
give
a
boy
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
put
him
in
business
and
the
chances
are
that
he
will
lose
every
dollar
of
it
before
he
is
a
year
older
like
buying
a
ticket
in
the
lottery
and
drawing
a
prize
it
is
easy
come
easy
he
does
not
know
the
value
of
it
nothing
is
worth
anything
unless
it
costs
effort
without
self
denial
and
economy
patience
and
perseverance
and
commencing
with
capital
which
you
have
not
earned
you
are
not
sure
to
succeed
in
accumulating
young
men
instead
of
waiting
for
dead
men
s
shoes
should
be
up
and
doing
for
there
is
no
class
of
persons
who
are
so
unaccommodating
in
regard
to
dying
as
these
rich
old
people
and
it
is
fortunate
for
the
expectant
heirs
that
it
is
so
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
rich
men
of
our
country
started
out
in
life
as
poor
boys
with
determined
wills
industry
perseverance
economy
and
good
habits
they
went
on
gradually
made
their
own
money
and
saved
it
and
this
is
the
best
way
to
acquire
a
fortune
stephen
girard
started
life
as
a
poor
cabin
boy
and
died
worth
nine
million
dollars
stewart
was
a
poor
irish
boy
now
he
pays
taxes
on
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
of
income
per
year
john
jacob
astor
was
a
poor
farmer
boy
and
died
worth
twenty
millions
cornelius
vanderbilt
began
life
rowing
a
boat
from
staten
island
to
new
york
now
he
presents
our
government
with
a
steamship
worth
a
million
of
dollars
and
he
is
worth
fifty
millions
there
is
no
royal
road
to
learning
says
the
proverb
and
i
may
say
it
is
equally
true
there
is
no
royal
road
to
but
i
think
there
is
a
royal
road
to
both
the
road
to
learning
is
a
royal
one
the
road
that
enables
the
student
to
expand
his
intellect
and
add
every
day
to
his
stock
of
knowledge
until
in
the
pleasant
process
of
intellectual
growth
he
is
able
to
solve
the
most
profound
problems
to
count
the
stars
to
analyze
every
atom
of
the
globe
and
to
measure
the
firmament
this
is
a
regal
highway
and
it
is
the
only
road
worth
travelling
so
in
regard
to
wealth
go
on
in
confidence
study
the
rules
and
above
all
things
study
human
nature
for
the
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
and
you
will
find
that
while
expanding
the
intellect
and
the
muscles
your
enlarged
experience
will
enable
you
every
day
to
accumulate
more
and
more
principal
which
will
increase
itself
by
interest
and
otherwise
until
you
arrive
at
a
state
of
independence
you
will
find
as
a
general
thing
that
the
poor
boys
get
rich
and
the
rich
boys
get
poor
for
instance
a
rich
man
at
his
decease
leaves
a
large
estate
to
his
family
his
eldest
sons
who
have
helped
him
earn
his
fortune
know
by
experience
the
value
of
money
and
they
take
their
inheritance
and
add
to
it
the
separate
portions
of
the
young
children
are
placed
at
interest
and
the
little
fellows
are
patted
on
the
head
and
told
a
dozen
times
a
day
you
are
rich
you
will
never
have
to
work
you
can
always
have
whatever
you
wish
for
you
were
born
with
a
golden
spoon
in
your
the
young
heir
soon
finds
out
what
that
means
he
has
the
finest
dresses
and
playthings
he
is
crammed
with
sugar
candies
and
almost
killed
with
kindness
and
he
passes
from
school
to
school
petted
and
flattered
he
becomes
arrogant
and
abuses
his
teachers
and
carries
everything
with
a
high
hand
he
knows
nothing
of
the
real
value
of
money
having
never
earned
any
but
he
knows
all
about
the
golden
spoon
business
at
college
he
invites
his
poor
to
his
room
where
he
wines
and
dines
them
he
is
cajoled
and
caressed
and
called
a
glorious
good
fellow
because
he
is
so
lavish
of
his
money
he
gives
his
game
suppers
drives
his
fast
horses
invites
his
chums
to
fÃªtes
and
parties
determined
to
have
lots
of
good
he
spends
the
night
in
frolics
and
debauchery
and
leads
off
his
companions
with
the
familiar
song
we
won
t
go
home
till
he
gets
them
to
join
him
in
pulling
down
signs
taking
gates
from
their
hinges
and
throwing
them
into
back
yards
and
if
the
police
arrest
them
he
knocks
them
down
is
taken
to
the
and
joyfully
foots
the
bills
ah
my
boys
he
cries
what
is
the
use
of
being
rich
if
you
can
t
enjoy
yourself
he
might
more
truly
say
if
you
can
t
make
a
fool
of
yourself
but
he
is
fast
hates
slow
things
and
don
t
see
young
men
loaded
down
with
other
people
s
money
are
almost
sure
to
lose
all
they
inherit
and
they
acquire
all
sorts
of
bad
habits
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
ruins
them
in
health
purse
and
character
in
this
country
one
generation
follows
another
and
the
poor
of
are
rich
in
the
next
generation
or
the
third
their
experience
leads
them
on
and
they
become
rich
and
they
leave
vast
riches
to
their
young
children
these
children
having
been
reared
in
luxury
are
inexperienced
and
get
poor
and
after
long
experience
another
generation
comes
on
and
gathers
up
riches
again
in
turn
and
thus
history
repeats
itself
and
happy
is
he
who
by
listening
to
the
experience
of
others
avoids
the
rocks
and
shoals
on
which
so
many
have
been
wrecked
learn
something
every
man
should
make
his
son
or
daughter
learn
some
trade
or
profession
so
that
in
these
days
of
changing
fortunes
of
being
rich
and
poor
they
may
have
something
tangible
to
fall
back
upon
this
provision
might
save
many
persons
from
misery
who
by
some
unexpected
turn
of
fortune
have
lost
all
their
means
let
hope
predominate
but
be
not
too
many
persons
are
always
kept
poor
because
they
are
too
visionary
every
project
looks
to
them
like
certain
success
and
therefore
they
keep
changing
from
one
business
to
another
always
in
hot
water
always
under
the
the
plan
of
counting
the
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
is
an
error
of
ancient
date
but
it
does
not
seem
to
improve
by
age
do
not
scatter
your
engage
in
one
kind
of
business
only
and
stick
to
it
faithfully
until
you
succeed
or
until
your
experience
shows
that
you
should
abandon
it
a
constant
hammering
on
one
nail
will
generally
drive
it
home
at
last
so
that
it
can
be
clinched
when
a
man
s
undivided
attention
is
centred
on
one
object
his
mind
will
constantly
be
suggesting
improvements
of
value
which
would
escape
him
if
his
brain
was
occupied
by
a
dozen
different
subjects
at
once
many
a
fortune
has
slipped
through
a
man
s
fingers
because
he
was
engaging
in
too
many
occupations
at
a
time
there
is
good
sense
in
the
old
caution
against
having
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
at
once
be
men
should
be
systematic
in
their
business
a
person
who
does
business
by
rule
having
a
time
and
place
for
everything
doing
his
work
promptly
will
accomplish
twice
as
much
and
with
half
the
trouble
of
him
who
does
it
carelessly
and
slipshod
by
introducing
system
into
all
your
transactions
doing
one
thing
at
a
time
always
meeting
appointments
with
punctuality
you
find
leisure
for
pastime
and
recreation
whereas
the
man
who
only
half
does
one
thing
and
then
turns
to
something
else
and
half
does
that
will
have
his
business
at
loose
ends
and
will
never
know
when
his
day
s
work
is
done
for
it
never
will
be
done
of
course
there
is
a
limit
to
all
these
rules
we
must
try
to
preserve
the
happy
medium
for
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
systematic
there
are
men
and
women
for
instance
who
put
away
things
so
carefully
that
they
can
never
find
them
again
it
is
too
much
like
the
red
tape
formality
at
washington
and
dickens
circumlocution
office
all
theory
and
no
result
when
the
astor
house
was
first
started
in
new
york
city
it
was
undoubtedly
the
best
hotel
in
the
country
the
proprietors
had
learned
a
good
deal
in
europe
regarding
hotels
and
the
landlords
were
proud
of
the
rigid
system
which
pervaded
every
department
of
their
great
establishment
when
twelve
o
clock
at
night
had
arrived
and
there
were
a
number
of
guests
around
one
of
the
proprietors
would
say
touch
that
bell
john
and
in
two
minutes
sixty
servants
with
a
water
bucket
in
each
hand
would
present
themselves
in
the
hall
this
said
the
landlord
addressing
his
guests
is
our
fire
bell
it
will
show
you
we
are
quite
safe
here
we
do
everything
this
was
before
the
croton
water
was
introduced
into
the
city
but
they
sometimes
carried
their
system
too
far
on
one
occasion
when
the
hotel
was
thronged
with
guests
one
of
the
waiters
was
suddenly
indisposed
and
although
there
were
fifty
waiters
in
the
hotel
the
landlord
thought
he
must
have
his
full
complement
or
his
system
would
be
interfered
with
just
before
dinner
time
he
rushed
down
stairs
and
said
there
must
be
another
waiter
i
am
one
waiter
short
what
can
i
do
he
happened
to
see
boots
the
irishman
pat
said
he
wash
your
hands
and
face
take
that
white
apron
and
come
into
the
dining
room
in
five
presently
pat
appeared
as
required
and
the
proprietor
said
now
pat
you
must
stand
behind
these
two
chairs
and
wait
on
the
gentlemen
who
will
occupy
them
did
you
ever
act
as
a
waiter
i
know
all
about
it
sure
but
i
never
did
like
the
irish
pilot
on
one
occasion
when
the
captain
thinking
he
was
considerably
out
of
his
course
asked
are
you
certain
you
understand
what
you
are
doing
pat
replied
sure
and
i
knows
every
rock
in
the
that
moment
bang
thumped
the
vessel
against
a
rock
ah
be
jabers
and
that
is
one
of
em
continued
the
pilot
but
to
return
to
the
pat
said
the
landlord
here
we
do
everything
systematically
you
must
first
give
the
gentlemen
each
a
plate
of
soup
and
when
they
finish
that
ask
them
what
they
will
have
pat
replied
ah
an
i
understand
parfectly
the
vartues
of
very
soon
in
came
the
guests
the
plates
of
soup
were
placed
before
them
one
of
pat
s
two
gentlemen
ate
his
soup
the
other
did
not
care
for
it
he
said
waiter
take
this
plate
away
and
bring
me
some
pat
looked
at
the
untasted
plate
of
soup
and
remembering
the
injunctions
of
the
landlord
in
regard
to
system
replied
not
till
ye
have
ate
yer
supe
of
course
that
was
carrying
system
entirely
too
far
read
the
always
take
a
trustworthy
newspaper
and
thus
keep
thoroughly
posted
in
regard
to
the
transactions
of
the
world
he
who
is
without
a
newspaper
is
cut
off
from
his
species
in
these
days
of
telegraphs
and
steam
many
important
inventions
and
improvements
in
every
branch
of
trade
are
being
made
and
he
who
don
t
consult
the
newspapers
will
soon
find
himself
and
his
business
left
out
in
the
cold
beware
of
outside
we
sometimes
see
men
who
have
obtained
fortunes
suddenly
become
poor
in
many
cases
this
arises
from
intemperance
and
often
from
gaming
and
other
bad
habits
frequently
it
occurs
because
a
man
has
been
engaged
in
outside
operations
of
some
sort
when
he
gets
rich
in
his
legitimate
business
he
is
told
of
a
grand
speculation
where
he
can
make
a
score
of
thousands
he
is
constantly
flattered
by
his
friends
who
tell
him
that
he
is
born
lucky
that
everything
he
touches
turns
into
gold
now
if
he
forgets
that
his
economical
habits
his
rectitude
of
conduct
and
a
personal
attention
to
a
business
which
he
understood
caused
his
success
in
life
he
will
listen
to
the
syren
voices
he
says
i
will
put
in
twenty
thousand
dollars
i
have
been
lucky
and
my
good
luck
will
soon
bring
me
back
sixty
thousand
a
few
days
elapse
and
it
is
discovered
he
must
put
in
ten
thousand
dollars
more
soon
after
he
is
told
it
is
all
right
but
certain
matters
not
foreseen
require
an
advance
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
more
which
will
bring
him
a
rich
harvest
but
before
the
time
comes
around
to
realize
the
bubble
bursts
he
loses
all
he
is
possessed
of
and
then
he
learns
what
he
ought
to
have
known
at
the
first
that
however
successful
a
man
may
be
in
his
own
business
if
he
turns
from
that
and
engages
in
a
business
which
he
don
t
understand
he
is
like
sampson
when
shorn
of
his
locks
his
strength
has
departed
and
he
becomes
like
other
men
if
a
man
has
plenty
of
money
he
ought
to
invest
something
in
everything
that
appears
to
promise
success
and
that
will
probably
benefit
mankind
but
let
the
sums
thus
invested
be
moderate
in
amount
and
never
let
a
man
foolishly
jeopardize
a
fortune
that
he
has
earned
in
a
legitimate
way
by
investing
it
in
things
in
which
he
has
had
no
experience
don
t
indorse
without
i
hold
that
no
man
ought
ever
to
indorse
a
note
or
become
security
for
any
man
be
it
his
father
or
brother
to
a
greater
extent
than
he
can
afford
to
lose
and
care
nothing
about
without
taking
good
security
here
is
a
man
that
is
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
he
is
doing
a
thriving
manufacturing
or
mercantile
trade
you
are
retired
and
living
on
your
money
he
comes
to
you
and
says
you
are
aware
that
i
am
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
don
t
owe
a
dollar
if
i
had
five
thousand
dollars
in
cash
i
could
purchase
a
particular
lot
of
goods
and
double
my
money
in
a
couple
of
months
will
you
indorse
my
note
for
that
amount
you
reflect
that
he
is
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
you
incur
no
risk
by
indorsing
his
note
you
like
to
accommodate
him
and
you
lend
your
name
without
taking
the
precaution
of
getting
security
shortly
after
he
shows
you
the
note
with
your
indorsement
cancelled
and
tells
you
probably
truly
that
he
made
the
profit
that
he
expected
by
the
operation
you
reflect
that
you
have
done
a
good
action
and
the
thought
makes
you
feel
happy
by
and
by
the
same
thing
occurs
again
and
you
do
it
again
you
have
already
fixed
the
impression
in
your
mind
that
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
indorse
his
notes
without
security
but
the
trouble
is
this
man
is
getting
money
too
easily
he
has
only
to
take
your
note
to
the
bank
get
it
discounted
and
take
the
cash
he
gets
money
for
the
time
being
without
effort
without
inconvenience
to
himself
now
mark
the
result
he
sees
a
chance
for
speculation
outside
of
his
business
a
temporary
investment
of
only
is
required
it
is
sure
to
come
back
before
a
note
at
the
bank
would
be
due
he
places
a
note
for
that
amount
before
you
you
sign
it
almost
mechanically
being
firmly
convinced
that
your
friend
is
responsible
and
trustworthy
you
indorse
his
notes
as
a
matter
of
unfortunately
the
speculation
does
not
come
to
a
head
quite
so
soon
as
was
expected
and
another
note
must
be
discounted
to
take
up
the
last
one
when
due
before
this
note
matures
the
speculation
has
proved
an
utter
failure
and
all
the
money
is
lost
does
the
loser
tell
his
friend
the
indorser
that
he
has
lost
half
of
his
fortune
not
at
all
he
don
t
even
mention
that
he
has
speculated
at
all
but
he
has
got
excited
the
spirit
of
speculation
has
seized
him
he
sees
others
making
large
sums
in
this
way
we
seldom
hear
of
the
losers
and
like
other
speculators
he
looks
for
his
money
where
he
loses
he
tries
again
indorsing
his
notes
has
become
chronic
with
you
and
at
every
loss
he
gets
your
signature
for
whatever
amount
he
wants
finally
you
discover
your
friend
has
lost
all
of
his
property
and
all
of
yours
you
are
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
and
grief
and
you
say
it
is
a
hard
thing
my
friend
here
has
ruined
me
but
you
should
add
i
have
also
ruined
if
you
had
said
in
the
first
place
i
will
accommodate
you
but
i
never
indorse
without
taking
ample
security
he
could
not
have
gone
beyond
the
length
of
his
tether
and
he
would
never
have
been
tempted
away
from
his
legitimate
business
it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
therefore
at
any
time
to
let
people
get
possession
of
money
too
easily
it
tempts
them
to
hazardous
speculations
if
nothing
more
solomon
truly
said
he
that
hateth
suretiship
is
so
with
the
young
man
starting
in
business
let
him
understand
the
value
of
money
by
earning
it
when
he
does
understand
its
value
then
grease
the
wheels
a
little
in
helping
him
to
start
business
but
remember
men
who
get
money
with
too
great
facility
can
not
usually
succeed
you
must
get
the
first
dollars
by
hard
knocks
and
at
some
sacrifice
in
order
to
appreciate
the
value
of
those
dollars
advertise
your
we
all
depend
more
or
less
upon
the
public
for
our
support
we
all
trade
with
the
public
lawyers
doctors
shoemakers
artists
blacksmiths
showmen
opera
singers
railroad
presidents
and
college
professors
those
who
deal
with
the
public
must
be
careful
that
their
goods
are
valuable
that
they
are
genuine
and
will
give
satisfaction
when
you
get
an
article
which
you
know
is
going
to
please
your
customers
and
that
when
they
have
tried
it
they
will
feel
they
have
got
their
money
s
worth
then
let
the
fact
be
known
that
you
have
got
it
be
careful
to
advertise
it
in
some
shape
or
other
because
it
is
evident
that
if
a
man
has
ever
so
good
an
article
for
sale
and
nobody
knows
it
it
will
bring
him
no
return
in
a
country
like
this
where
nearly
everybody
reads
and
where
newspapers
are
issued
and
circulated
in
editions
of
five
thousand
to
two
hundred
thousand
it
would
be
very
unwise
if
this
channel
was
not
taken
advantage
of
to
reach
the
public
in
advertising
a
newspaper
goes
into
the
family
and
is
read
by
wife
and
children
as
well
as
the
head
of
the
house
hence
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
may
read
your
advertisement
while
you
are
attending
to
your
routine
business
many
perhaps
read
it
while
you
are
asleep
the
whole
philosophy
of
life
is
first
sow
then
that
is
the
way
the
farmer
does
he
plants
his
potatoes
and
corn
and
sows
his
grain
and
then
goes
about
something
else
and
the
time
comes
when
he
reaps
but
he
never
reaps
first
and
sows
afterwards
this
principle
applies
to
all
kinds
of
business
and
to
nothing
more
eminently
than
to
advertising
if
a
man
has
a
genuine
article
there
is
no
way
in
which
he
can
reap
more
advantageously
than
by
sowing
to
the
public
in
this
way
he
must
of
course
have
a
really
good
article
and
one
which
will
please
his
customers
anything
spurious
will
not
succeed
permanently
because
the
public
is
wiser
than
many
imagine
men
and
women
are
selfish
and
we
all
prefer
purchasing
where
we
can
get
the
most
for
our
money
and
we
try
to
find
out
where
we
can
most
surely
do
so
you
may
advertise
a
spurious
article
and
induce
many
people
to
call
and
buy
it
once
but
they
will
denounce
you
as
an
imposter
and
swindler
and
your
business
will
gradually
die
out
and
leave
you
poor
this
is
right
few
people
can
safely
depend
upon
chance
custom
you
all
need
to
have
your
customers
return
and
purchase
again
a
man
said
to
me
i
have
tried
advertising
and
did
not
succeed
yet
i
have
a
good
i
replied
my
friend
there
may
be
exceptions
to
a
general
rule
but
how
do
you
advertise
i
put
it
in
a
weekly
newspaper
three
times
and
paid
a
dollar
and
a
half
for
i
replied
sir
advertising
is
like
learning
a
little
is
a
dangerous
a
french
writer
says
that
the
reader
of
a
newspaper
does
not
see
the
first
insertion
of
an
ordinary
advertisement
the
second
insertion
he
sees
but
does
not
read
the
third
insertion
he
reads
the
fourth
insertion
he
looks
at
the
price
the
fifth
insertion
he
speaks
of
it
to
his
wife
the
sixth
insertion
he
is
ready
to
purchase
and
the
seventh
insertion
he
your
object
in
advertising
is
to
make
the
public
understand
what
you
have
got
to
sell
and
if
you
have
not
the
pluck
to
keep
advertising
until
you
have
imparted
that
information
all
the
money
you
have
spent
is
lost
you
are
like
the
fellow
who
told
the
gentleman
if
he
would
give
him
ten
cents
it
would
save
him
a
dollar
how
can
i
help
you
so
much
with
so
small
a
sum
asked
the
gentleman
in
surprise
i
started
out
this
morning
hiccupped
the
fellow
with
the
full
determination
to
get
drunk
and
i
have
spent
my
only
dollar
to
accomplish
the
object
and
it
has
not
quite
done
it
ten
cents
worth
more
of
whiskey
would
just
do
it
and
in
this
manner
i
should
save
the
dollar
already
so
a
man
who
advertises
at
all
must
keep
it
up
until
the
public
know
who
and
what
he
is
and
what
his
business
is
or
else
the
money
invested
in
advertising
is
lost
some
men
have
a
peculiar
genius
for
writing
a
striking
advertisement
one
that
will
arrest
the
attention
of
the
reader
at
first
sight
this
tact
of
course
gives
the
advertiser
a
great
advantage
sometimes
a
man
makes
himself
popular
by
an
unique
sign
or
a
curious
display
in
his
window
recently
i
observed
a
swing
sign
extending
over
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
a
store
on
which
was
the
inscription
in
plain
letters
don
t
read
the
other
of
course
i
did
and
so
did
everybody
else
and
i
learned
that
the
man
had
made
an
independence
by
first
attracting
the
public
to
his
business
in
that
way
and
then
using
his
customers
well
afterwards
genin
the
hatter
bought
the
first
jenny
lind
ticket
at
auction
for
two
hundred
and
dollars
because
he
knew
it
would
be
a
good
advertisement
for
him
who
is
the
bidder
said
the
auctioneer
as
he
knocked
down
that
ticket
at
castle
garden
genin
the
hatter
was
the
response
here
were
thousands
of
people
from
the
fifth
avenue
and
from
distant
cities
in
the
highest
stations
in
life
who
is
genin
the
hatter
they
exclaimed
they
had
never
heard
of
him
before
the
next
morning
the
newspapers
and
telegraph
had
circulated
the
facts
from
maine
to
texas
and
from
five
to
ten
millions
of
people
had
read
that
the
tickets
sold
at
auction
for
jenny
lind
s
first
concert
amounted
to
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
that
a
single
ticket
was
sold
at
two
hundred
and
dollars
to
genin
the
men
throughout
the
country
involuntarily
took
off
their
hats
to
see
if
they
had
a
genin
hat
on
their
heads
at
a
town
in
iowa
it
was
found
that
in
the
crowd
around
the
post
office
there
was
one
man
who
had
a
genin
hat
and
he
showed
it
in
triumph
although
it
was
worn
out
and
not
worth
two
cents
why
one
man
exclaimed
you
have
a
real
genin
hat
what
a
lucky
fellow
you
another
man
said
hang
on
to
that
hat
it
will
be
a
valuable
in
your
still
another
man
in
the
crowd
who
seemed
to
envy
the
possessor
of
this
good
fortune
said
come
give
us
all
a
chance
put
it
up
at
auction
he
did
so
and
it
was
sold
as
a
keepsake
for
nine
dollars
and
fifty
cents
what
was
the
consequence
to
genin
he
sold
ten
thousand
extra
hats
per
annum
the
first
six
years
of
the
purchasers
bought
of
him
probably
out
of
curiosity
and
many
of
them
finding
that
he
gave
them
an
equivalent
for
their
money
became
his
regular
customers
this
novel
advertisement
first
struck
their
attention
and
then
as
he
made
a
good
article
they
came
again
now
i
don
t
say
that
everybody
should
advertise
as
genin
did
but
i
say
if
a
man
has
got
goods
for
sale
and
he
don
t
advertise
them
in
some
way
the
chances
are
that
some
day
the
sheriff
will
do
it
for
him
nor
do
i
say
that
everybody
must
advertise
in
a
newspaper
or
indeed
use
printers
ink
at
all
on
the
contrary
although
that
article
is
indispensable
in
the
majority
of
cases
yet
doctors
and
clergymen
and
sometimes
lawyers
and
some
others
can
more
effectually
reach
the
public
in
some
other
manner
but
it
is
obvious
they
must
be
known
in
some
way
else
how
could
they
be
supported
be
polite
and
kind
to
your
customers
politeness
and
civility
are
the
best
capital
ever
invested
in
business
large
stores
gilt
signs
flaming
advertisements
will
all
prove
unavailing
if
you
or
your
employees
treat
your
patrons
abruptly
the
truth
is
the
more
kind
and
liberal
a
man
is
the
more
generous
will
be
the
patronage
bestowed
upon
him
like
begets
the
man
who
gives
the
greatest
amount
of
goods
of
a
corresponding
quality
for
the
least
sum
still
reserving
to
himself
a
profit
will
generally
succeed
best
in
the
long
run
this
brings
us
to
the
golden
rule
as
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
also
to
them
and
they
will
do
better
by
you
than
if
you
always
treated
them
as
if
you
wanted
to
get
the
most
you
could
out
of
them
for
the
least
return
men
who
drive
sharp
bargains
with
their
customers
acting
as
if
they
never
expected
to
see
them
again
will
not
be
mistaken
they
never
will
see
them
again
as
customers
people
don
t
like
to
pay
and
get
kicked
also
one
of
the
ushers
in
my
museum
once
told
me
he
intended
to
whip
a
man
who
was
in
the
lecture
room
as
soon
as
he
came
out
what
for
i
inquired
because
he
said
i
was
no
gentleman
replied
the
usher
never
mind
i
replied
he
pays
for
that
and
you
will
not
convince
him
you
are
a
gentleman
by
whipping
him
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
a
customer
if
you
whip
him
he
will
never
visit
the
museum
again
and
he
will
induce
friends
to
go
with
him
to
other
places
of
amusement
instead
of
this
and
thus
you
see
i
should
be
a
serious
but
he
insulted
me
muttered
the
usher
exactly
i
replied
and
if
he
owned
the
museum
and
you
had
paid
him
for
the
privilege
of
visiting
it
and
he
had
then
insulted
you
there
might
be
some
reason
in
your
resenting
it
but
in
this
instance
he
is
the
man
who
pays
while
we
receive
and
you
must
therefore
put
up
with
his
bad
my
usher
laughingly
remarked
that
this
was
undoubtedly
the
true
policy
but
he
added
that
he
should
not
object
to
an
increase
of
salary
if
he
was
expected
to
be
abused
in
order
to
promote
my
interests
be
of
course
men
should
be
charitable
because
it
is
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
but
even
as
a
matter
of
policy
if
you
possess
no
higher
incentive
you
will
find
that
the
liberal
man
will
command
patronage
while
the
sordid
uncharitable
miser
will
be
avoided
solomon
says
there
is
that
scattereth
and
yet
increaseth
and
there
is
that
withholdeth
more
than
meet
but
it
tendeth
to
of
course
the
only
true
charity
is
that
which
is
from
the
heart
the
best
kind
of
charity
is
to
help
those
who
are
willing
to
help
themselves
promiscuous
almsgiving
without
inquiring
into
the
worthiness
of
the
applicant
is
bad
in
every
sense
but
to
search
out
and
quietly
assist
those
who
are
struggling
for
themselves
is
the
kind
that
scattereth
and
yet
but
don
t
fall
into
the
idea
that
some
persons
practise
of
giving
a
prayer
instead
of
a
potato
and
a
benediction
instead
of
bread
to
the
hungry
it
is
easier
to
make
christians
with
full
stomachs
than
empty
don
t
some
men
have
a
foolish
habit
of
telling
their
business
secrets
if
they
make
money
they
like
to
tell
their
neighbors
how
it
was
done
nothing
is
gained
by
this
and
ofttimes
much
is
lost
say
nothing
about
your
profits
your
hopes
your
expectations
your
intentions
and
this
should
apply
to
letters
as
well
as
to
conversation
goethe
makes
mephistophiles
say
never
write
a
letter
nor
destroy
business
men
must
write
letters
but
they
should
be
careful
what
they
put
in
them
if
you
are
losing
money
be
specially
cautious
and
not
tell
of
it
or
you
will
lose
your
reputation
preserve
your
it
is
more
precious
than
diamonds
or
rubies
the
old
miser
said
to
his
sons
get
money
get
it
honestly
if
you
can
but
get
this
advice
was
not
only
atrociously
wicked
but
it
was
the
very
essence
of
stupidity
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
if
you
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
money
honestly
you
can
easily
get
it
dishonestly
get
it
in
that
poor
fool
not
to
know
that
the
most
difficult
thing
in
life
is
to
make
money
dishonestly
not
to
know
that
our
prisons
are
full
of
men
who
attempted
to
follow
this
advice
not
to
understand
that
no
man
can
be
dishonest
without
soon
being
found
out
and
that
when
his
lack
of
principle
is
discovered
nearly
every
avenue
to
success
is
closed
against
him
forever
the
public
very
properly
shun
all
whose
integrity
is
doubted
no
matter
how
polite
and
pleasant
and
accommodating
a
man
may
be
none
of
us
dare
to
deal
with
him
if
we
suspect
false
weights
and
strict
honesty
not
only
lies
at
the
foundation
of
all
success
in
life
financially
but
in
every
other
respect
uncompromising
integrity
of
character
is
invaluable
it
secures
to
its
possessor
a
peace
and
joy
which
can
not
be
attained
without
it
which
no
amount
of
money
or
houses
and
lands
can
purchase
a
man
who
is
known
to
be
strictly
honest
may
be
ever
so
poor
but
he
has
the
purses
of
all
the
community
at
his
disposal
for
all
know
that
if
he
promises
to
return
what
he
borrows
he
will
never
disappoint
them
as
a
mere
matter
of
selfishness
therefore
if
a
man
had
no
higher
motive
for
being
honest
all
will
find
that
the
maxim
of
franklin
can
never
fail
to
be
true
that
honesty
is
the
best
to
get
rich
is
not
always
equivalent
to
being
successful
there
are
many
rich
poor
men
while
there
are
many
others
honest
and
devout
men
and
women
who
have
never
possessed
so
much
money
as
some
rich
persons
squander
in
a
week
but
who
are
nevertheless
really
richer
and
happier
than
any
man
can
ever
be
while
he
is
a
transgressor
of
the
higher
laws
of
his
being
the
inordinate
love
of
money
no
doubt
may
be
and
is
the
root
of
all
evil
but
money
itself
when
properly
used
is
not
only
a
handy
thing
to
have
in
the
house
but
affords
the
gratification
of
blessing
our
race
by
enabling
its
possessor
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
human
happiness
and
human
influence
the
desire
for
wealth
is
nearly
universal
and
none
can
say
it
is
not
laudable
provided
the
possessor
of
it
accepts
its
responsibilities
and
uses
it
as
a
friend
to
humanity
the
history
of
money
getting
which
is
commerce
is
a
history
of
civilization
and
wherever
trade
has
flourished
most
there
too
have
art
and
science
produced
the
noblest
fruits
in
fact
as
a
general
thing
money
getters
are
the
benefactors
of
our
race
to
them
in
a
great
measure
are
we
indebted
for
our
institutions
of
learning
and
of
art
our
academies
colleges
and
churches
it
is
no
argument
against
the
desire
for
or
the
possession
of
wealth
to
say
that
there
are
sometimes
misers
who
hoard
money
only
for
the
sake
of
hoarding
and
who
have
no
higher
aspiration
than
to
grasp
everything
which
comes
within
their
reach
as
we
have
sometimes
hypocrites
in
religion
and
demagogues
in
politics
so
there
are
occasionally
misers
among
money
getters
these
however
are
only
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
but
when
in
this
country
we
find
such
a
nuisance
and
stumbling
block
as
a
miser
we
remember
with
gratitude
that
in
america
we
have
no
laws
of
primogeniture
and
that
in
the
due
course
of
nature
the
time
will
come
when
the
hoarded
dust
will
be
scattered
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
to
all
men
and
women
therefore
do
i
conscientiously
say
make
money
honestly
and
not
otherwise
for
shakespeare
has
truly
said
he
that
wants
money
means
and
content
is
without
three
good
nearly
every
paper
in
london
had
something
to
say
about
my
lecture
and
in
almost
every
instance
the
matter
and
manner
of
the
lecturer
were
unqualifiedly
approved
indeed
the
profusion
of
praise
quite
overwhelmed
me
the
london
december
concluded
a
criticism
with
the
following
paragraph
we
are
bound
to
admit
that
barnum
is
one
of
the
most
entertaining
lecturers
that
ever
addressed
an
audience
on
a
theme
universally
intelligible
the
appearance
of
barnum
it
should
be
added
has
nothing
of
the
charlatan
about
it
but
is
that
of
the
thoroughly
respectable
man
of
business
and
he
has
at
command
a
fund
of
dry
humor
that
convulses
everybody
with
laughter
while
he
himself
remains
perfectly
serious
a
sonorous
voice
and
an
admirably
clear
delivery
complete
his
qualifications
as
a
lecturer
in
which
capacity
he
is
no
humbug
either
in
a
higher
or
lower
sense
of
the
the
london
the
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
other
lesser
journals
of
the
same
date
all
contained
lengthy
and
favorable
notices
and
criticisms
of
my
lecture
my
own
lavish
advertisements
were
as
nothing
to
the
notoriety
which
the
london
newspapers
voluntarily
and
editorially
gave
to
my
new
enterprise
the
weekly
and
literary
papers
followed
in
the
train
and
even
which
had
already
done
so
much
to
keep
tom
thumb
before
the
public
gave
me
a
notice
with
an
illustration
and
thereafter
favored
me
with
frequent
paragraphs
the
city
thus
prepared
the
provinces
to
give
me
a
cordial
reception
during
the
year
i
delivered
this
lecture
nearly
one
hundred
times
in
different
parts
of
england
returning
occasionally
to
london
to
repeat
it
to
fresh
audiences
and
always
with
pecuniary
success
every
provincial
paper
had
something
to
say
about
barnum
and
the
art
of
money
getting
and
i
was
never
more
pleasantly
or
profusely
advertised
the
tour
too
made
me
acquainted
with
many
new
people
and
added
fresh
and
fast
friends
to
my
continually
increasing
list
my
lecturing
season
is
among
my
most
grateful
memories
of
england
remembering
my
experiences
some
years
before
with
general
tom
thumb
at
oxford
and
cambridge
and
the
fondness
of
the
undergraduates
for
practical
joking
i
was
quite
prepared
when
i
made
up
my
mind
to
visit
those
two
cities
to
take
any
quantity
of
chaff
and
lampooning
which
the
university
boys
might
choose
to
bring
i
was
sure
of
a
full
house
in
each
city
and
as
i
was
anxious
to
earn
all
the
money
i
could
so
as
to
hasten
my
deliverance
from
financial
difficulties
i
fully
resolved
to
put
up
with
whatever
offered
indeed
i
rather
liked
the
idea
of
an
episode
in
the
steady
run
of
praise
which
had
followed
my
lecture
everywhere
and
i
felt
too
in
the
coming
encounter
that
i
might
give
quite
as
much
as
i
was
compelled
to
take
i
commenced
at
cambridge
and
as
i
expected
to
an
overflowing
house
largely
composed
of
undergraduates
soon
after
i
began
to
speak
one
of
the
young
men
called
out
where
is
joice
heth
to
which
i
very
coolly
replied
young
gentleman
please
to
restrain
yourself
till
the
conclusion
of
the
lecture
when
i
shall
take
great
delight
in
affording
you
or
any
others
of
her
posterity
all
the
information
i
possess
concerning
your
deceased
this
reply
turned
the
laugh
against
the
youthful
and
anxious
inquirer
and
had
the
effect
of
keeping
other
students
quiet
for
a
half
hour
thereafter
questions
of
a
similar
character
were
occasionally
propounded
but
as
each
inquirer
generally
received
a
prompt
roland
for
his
oliver
there
was
far
less
interruption
than
i
had
anticipated
the
proceeds
of
the
evening
were
more
than
one
hundred
pounds
sterling
an
important
addition
to
my
treasury
at
that
time
at
the
close
of
the
lecture
several
students
invited
me
to
a
sumptuous
supper
where
i
met
among
other
undergraduates
a
nephew
of
lord
macaulay
the
historian
this
young
gentleman
insisted
upon
my
breakfasting
with
him
at
his
rooms
next
morning
but
as
i
was
anxious
to
take
an
early
train
for
london
i
only
called
to
leave
my
card
and
after
his
gyp
had
given
me
a
strong
cup
of
coffee
i
hastened
away
leaving
the
young
macaulay
whom
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
fast
asleep
in
bed
at
oxford
the
large
hall
was
filled
half
an
hour
before
the
time
announced
for
the
lecture
to
begin
and
the
sale
of
tickets
was
stopped
i
then
stepped
upon
the
platform
and
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
every
seat
is
occupied
and
the
is
closed
i
propose
to
proceed
with
my
lecture
now
and
not
keep
you
waiting
till
the
advertised
good
for
you
old
barnum
said
one
time
is
money
said
another
nothing
like
economy
came
from
a
third
and
other
remarks
and
exclamations
followed
which
excited
much
laughter
in
the
audience
holding
up
my
hand
as
a
signal
that
i
was
anxious
to
say
something
so
soon
as
silence
should
be
restored
i
thus
addressed
my
audience
young
gentlemen
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
in
order
that
we
may
have
a
thorough
understanding
between
ourselves
at
the
outset
i
see
symptoms
of
a
pretty
jolly
time
here
this
evening
and
you
have
paid
me
liberally
for
the
single
hour
of
my
time
which
is
at
your
service
i
am
an
old
traveller
and
an
old
showman
and
i
like
to
please
my
patrons
now
it
is
quite
immaterial
to
me
you
may
furnish
the
entertainment
for
the
hour
or
i
will
endeavor
to
do
so
or
we
will
take
portions
of
the
time
by
turns
you
supplying
a
part
of
the
amusement
and
i
a
part
as
we
say
sometimes
in
america
you
pays
your
money
and
you
takes
your
my
auditors
were
in
the
best
of
humor
from
the
beginning
and
my
frankness
pleased
them
good
for
you
old
barnum
cried
their
leader
and
i
went
on
with
my
lecture
for
some
fifteen
minutes
when
a
voice
called
out
come
old
chap
you
must
be
tired
by
this
time
hold
up
now
till
we
sing
yankee
doodle
whereupon
they
all
joined
in
that
pleasing
air
with
a
vigor
which
showed
that
they
had
thoroughly
prepared
themselves
for
the
occasion
and
meanwhile
i
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
to
show
them
that
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
their
manner
of
passing
the
time
when
the
song
was
concluded
the
leader
of
the
party
said
now
barnum
you
may
go
ahead
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
quietly
remarked
oh
there
is
time
for
lots
of
fun
yet
we
have
nearly
forty
minutes
of
the
hour
remaining
and
i
proceeded
with
my
lecture
or
rather
a
lecture
for
i
began
to
adapt
my
remarks
to
the
audience
and
the
occasion
at
intervals
of
ten
minutes
or
so
came
interruptions
which
i
as
my
audience
saw
fully
enjoyed
as
much
as
the
house
did
when
this
miscellaneous
entertainment
was
concluded
and
i
stopped
short
at
the
end
of
the
hour
crowds
of
the
young
men
pressed
forward
to
shake
hands
with
me
declaring
that
they
had
had
a
jolly
good
time
while
the
leader
said
stay
with
us
a
week
barnum
and
we
will
dine
you
wine
you
and
give
you
full
houses
every
but
i
was
announced
to
lecture
in
london
the
next
evening
and
i
could
not
accept
the
pressing
invitation
though
i
would
gladly
have
stayed
through
the
week
they
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
about
america
the
museum
my
various
shows
and
successes
and
expressed
the
hope
that
i
would
come
out
of
my
clock
troubles
all
right
at
least
a
score
of
them
pressed
me
to
breakfast
with
them
next
morning
but
i
declined
till
one
young
gentleman
put
it
on
this
purely
personal
ground
my
dear
sir
you
must
breakfast
with
me
i
have
almost
split
my
throat
in
screaming
here
and
it
is
only
fair
that
you
should
repay
me
by
coming
to
see
me
in
the
this
appeal
was
irresistible
and
at
the
appointed
time
i
met
him
and
half
a
dozen
of
his
friends
at
his
table
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
hour
together
they
complimented
me
on
the
tact
and
equanimity
i
had
exhibited
the
previous
evening
but
i
replied
oh
i
was
quite
inclined
to
have
you
enjoy
your
fun
and
came
fully
prepared
for
but
they
liked
better
they
said
to
get
the
party
angry
a
fortnight
before
they
told
me
my
friend
howard
paul
had
left
them
in
disgust
because
they
insisted
upon
smoking
while
his
wife
was
on
the
stage
adding
that
the
entertainment
was
excellent
and
that
howard
paul
could
have
made
a
thousand
pounds
if
he
had
not
let
his
anger
drive
him
away
my
friends
parted
with
me
at
the
railway
station
heartily
urging
me
to
come
again
and
my
ticket
seller
returned
as
the
immediate
result
of
an
evening
s
fun
with
the
oxford
boys
after
delivering
my
lecture
many
times
in
different
places
a
prominent
publishing
house
in
london
offered
me
for
the
copyright
this
offer
i
declined
not
that
i
thought
the
lecture
worth
more
money
but
because
i
had
engaged
to
deliver
it
in
several
towns
and
cities
and
i
thought
the
publication
would
be
detrimental
to
the
public
delivery
of
my
lecture
it
was
a
source
of
very
considerable
emolument
to
me
bringing
in
much
money
which
went
towards
the
redemption
of
my
pecuniary
obligations
so
that
the
lecture
itself
was
an
admirable
illustration
of
the
art
of
money

while
visiting
manchester
in
i
was
invited
by
peacock
the
lessee
to
deliver
a
lecture
in
free
trade
i
gave
a
lecture
the
title
of
which
i
now
forget
but
i
well
remember
it
contained
numerous
personal
reminiscences
the
next
day
a
gentleman
sent
his
card
to
my
room
at
the
hotel
where
i
was
stopping
i
requested
the
servant
to
show
the
gentleman
up
at
once
and
he
soon
appeared
and
introduced
himself
at
first
he
seemed
somewhat
embarrassed
but
gradually
broke
the
ice
by
saying
he
had
been
pleased
in
listening
to
my
lecture
the
previous
evening
and
added
that
he
knew
my
history
pretty
well
as
he
had
read
my
autobiography
as
his
embarrassment
at
first
meeting
with
a
stranger
wore
away
he
informed
me
that
he
was
joint
proprietor
with
another
gentleman
in
a
in
bury
near
manchester
although
he
modestly
added
only
a
few
years
ago
i
was
working
as
a
journeyman
and
probably
should
have
been
at
this
time
had
it
not
been
for
your
observing
my
surprise
at
this
announcement
he
continued
the
fact
is
barnum
upon
reading
your
autobiography
i
thought
i
perceived
you
tried
to
make
yourself
out
something
worse
than
you
really
were
for
i
discovered
a
pleasant
spirit
and
a
good
heart
under
the
rougher
exterior
in
which
you
chose
to
present
yourself
to
the
public
but
he
added
after
reading
your
life
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
renewed
strength
and
awakened
energies
and
aspirations
and
i
said
to
myself
why
can
t
i
go
ahead
and
make
money
as
barnum
did
he
commenced
without
money
and
succeeded
why
may
not
i
in
this
train
of
thought
he
continued
i
went
to
a
newspaper
office
and
advertised
for
a
partner
with
money
to
join
me
in
establishing
a
i
had
no
applications
and
remembering
your
experiences
when
you
had
money
and
wanted
a
partner
i
spent
half
a
crown
in
a
similar
experiment
i
advertised
for
a
partner
to
join
a
man
who
had
plenty
of
capital
then
i
had
lots
of
applicants
ready
to
introduce
me
into
all
sorts
of
occupations
from
that
of
a
banker
to
that
of
a
or
gambler
if
i
would
only
furnish
the
money
to
start
with
after
a
while
i
advertised
again
for
a
partner
and
obtained
one
with
money
we
have
a
good
mill
i
devote
myself
closely
to
business
and
have
been
very
successful
i
know
every
line
in
your
book
so
indeed
do
several
members
of
my
family
and
i
have
conducted
my
business
on
the
principles
laid
down
in
your
published
rules
for
i
find
them
correct
principles
and
sir
i
have
sought
this
interview
in
order
to
thank
you
for
publishing
your
autobiography
and
to
tell
you
that
to
that
act
of
yours
i
attribute
my
present
position
in
of
course
i
was
pleased
and
surprised
at
this
revelation
and
feeling
that
my
new
friend
whom
i
will
call
wilson
b
had
somewhat
exaggerated
the
results
of
my
labors
as
influencing
his
own
i
said
your
statement
is
certainly
very
flattering
and
i
am
glad
if
i
have
been
able
in
any
manner
through
my
experiences
to
aid
you
in
starting
in
life
but
i
presume
your
genius
would
have
found
vent
in
good
time
if
i
had
never
written
a
no
indeed
it
would
not
he
replied
in
an
earnest
tone
i
am
sure
i
should
have
worked
as
a
all
my
life
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
oh
i
have
made
no
secret
of
it
he
continued
the
commercial
men
with
whom
i
deal
know
all
about
it
indeed
they
call
me
barnum
on
change
here
in
b
by
his
consent
i
state
that
his
name
is
john
fish
this
singular
yet
gratifying
interview
led
to
several
others
and
from
that
time
a
warm
personal
friendship
sprung
up
between
us
in
our
conversations
my
enthusiastic
friend
would
often
quote
entire
pages
from
my
autobiography
which
i
had
almost
forgotten
and
after
he
had
frequently
visited
me
by
appointment
where
i
happened
to
be
stopping
in
different
parts
of
great
britain
he
would
write
me
letters
often
quoting
scraps
of
my
conversation
and
extolling
what
he
called
the
wisdom
of
these
careless
remarks
i
laughed
at
him
and
told
him
he
was
about
half
well
he
replied
then
there
is
method
in
my
madness
for
whenever
i
follow
the
barnum
rules
i
am
always
on
one
occasion
when
general
tom
thumb
exhibited
in
bury
wilson
closed
his
mill
and
gave
each
of
his
employÃ©s
a
ticket
to
the
exhibition
out
of
respect
as
he
said
to
barnum
on
a
subsequent
occasion
when
the
little
general
visited
england
the
last
time
wilson
invited
him
his
wife
commodore
nutt
minnie
warren
and
the
managers
of
the
show
to
a
splendid
and
sumptuous
dinner
at
his
house
which
the
distinguished
little
party
enjoyed
exceedingly
and
several
interesting
incidents
occurred
on
that
pleasant
occasion
which
the
miniature
guests
will
never
cease
to
remember
with
gratitude
when
i
was
about
to
leave
england
for
home
in
my
friend
wilson
made
an
appointment
to
come
to
liverpool
to
see
me
off
he
came
the
day
before
i
sailed
and
brought
his
little
daughter
some
twelve
years
old
with
him
we
had
a
remarkably
pleasant
and
social
time
and
i
did
not
part
with
them
until
the
tug
was
almost
dropping
off
from
the
steamer
in
the
river
mersey
it
was
a
very
reluctant
parting
we
waved
our
handkerchiefs
until
we
could
no
longer
distinguish
each
other
and
up
to
the
present
writing
we
have
never
again
met
to
my
numerous
invitations
to
him
and
his
family
to
visit
me
in
america
he
sends
but
one
response
that
as
yet
his
business
will
not
permit
him
to
leave
home
i
hope
ere
long
to
receive
a
different
answer
our
correspondence
has
been
regularly
kept
up
ever
since
we
parted
my
friend
wilson
expressed
himself
extremely
anxious
to
do
any
service
for
me
which
might
at
any
time
be
in
his
power
soon
after
i
arrived
in
america
i
read
an
account
of
a
french
giant
then
exhibiting
in
paris
and
said
to
be
over
eight
feet
in
height
as
this
was
a
considerably
greater
altitude
than
any
specimen
of
the
within
my
knowledge
had
attained
i
wrote
to
my
friend
to
take
a
trip
to
paris
for
me
secure
an
interview
with
this
modern
anak
and
by
actual
measurement
obtain
for
me
his
exact
height
i
enclosed
an
offer
for
this
giant
s
services
arranging
the
price
on
a
sliding
scale
according
to
what
his
height
should
actually
prove
to
be
commencing
at
eight
feet
and
descending
to
seven
feet
two
inches
and
if
he
was
not
taller
than
the
latter
figure
i
did
not
want
him
at
all
wilson
placing
an
english
rule
in
his
pocket
started
for
paris
and
after
much
difficulty
and
several
days
delay
in
trying
to
speak
with
the
giant
who
was
closely
watched
by
his
exhibitor
wilson
succeeded
by
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
in
exchanging
a
few
words
with
him
and
appointing
an
interview
at
his
own
the
giant
s
lodgings
and
now
came
a
trouble
which
required
all
the
patience
and
diplomacy
which
my
agent
could
command
wilson
arriving
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
told
the
giant
who
he
was
and
the
object
of
his
visit
in
fact
he
showed
him
my
letter
and
read
the
tempting
offers
which
i
made
for
his
services
provided
he
measured
eight
feet
or
even
came
within
six
inches
of
that
height
oh
i
measure
over
eight
feet
in
height
said
the
giant
very
likely
replied
my
faithful
agent
but
you
see
my
orders
are
to
measure
there
s
no
need
of
that
you
can
see
for
yourself
stretching
himself
up
a
few
inches
by
aid
of
that
peculiar
muscular
knack
which
giants
and
dwarfs
exercise
when
they
desire
to
extend
or
diminish
their
apparent
stature
no
doubt
you
are
right
persisted
the
agent
but
you
see
that
is
not
according
to
well
stand
alongside
of
me
see
the
top
of
your
hat
don
t
come
to
my
shoulder
said
the
giant
as
he
swung
his
arm
completely
over
wilson
s
head
hat
and
all
but
my
wary
agent
happened
just
then
to
be
watching
illustration
long
and
short
of
the
giant
s
feet
and
knees
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
movement
around
the
understandings
that
materially
helped
the
elevation
of
the
it
is
all
very
well
said
wilson
but
i
tell
you
i
have
brought
a
rule
from
england
and
if
i
am
not
permitted
to
measure
your
height
with
that
i
shall
not
engage
my
offer
had
been
very
liberal
in
fact
provided
he
was
eight
feet
high
it
was
more
than
four
times
the
amount
the
giant
was
then
receiving
it
was
evidently
a
great
temptation
to
his
highness
and
quite
as
evidently
he
did
not
want
to
be
fairly
measured
well
said
the
giant
if
you
can
t
take
my
word
for
it
look
at
that
door
you
see
my
head
is
more
than
two
feet
above
the
top
giving
his
neck
and
every
muscle
in
his
body
a
severe
stretch
just
measure
the
height
of
that
my
english
friend
plainly
saw
that
the
giant
felt
that
he
could
not
come
up
to
the
mark
and
he
laughed
at
this
last
oh
i
don
t
want
to
measure
the
door
i
prefer
to
measure
you
said
wilson
coolly
the
giant
was
now
desperate
and
stretching
himself
up
to
the
highest
point
he
exclaimed
well
be
quick
put
your
rule
down
to
my
feet
and
measure
me
no
delay
if
you
the
giant
knew
he
could
not
hold
himself
up
many
seconds
to
the
few
extra
inches
he
had
imparted
to
his
extended
muscles
but
his
remark
had
drawn
wilson
s
attention
to
his
feet
and
from
the
feet
to
the
boots
and
he
began
to
open
his
eyes
look
here
monsieur
he
exclaimed
with
much
earnestness
this
sort
of
thing
wont
do
you
know
i
don
t
understand
this
contrivance
around
the
soles
of
your
boots
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
got
a
set
of
springs
in
there
which
materially
aids
your
altitude
a
few
inches
when
you
desire
it
now
i
shall
stand
no
more
nonsense
if
i
engage
you
at
all
you
must
first
take
off
your
boots
and
lie
flat
upon
your
back
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
you
will
have
no
purchase
and
you
may
stretch
as
much
as
you
like
and
for
every
inch
you
fairly
measure
above
seven
feet
two
inches
you
know
what
i
am
authorized
to
give
the
giant
grumbled
and
talked
about
his
word
being
doubted
and
his
honor
assailed
but
wilson
calmly
persisted
until
at
length
he
slowly
took
off
his
coat
and
gradually
got
down
on
the
floor
stretched
upon
his
back
he
made
several
vain
efforts
to
extend
his
natural
height
wilson
carefully
applied
his
english
rule
the
result
of
the
measurement
causing
him
much
astonishment
and
the
giant
more
indignation
the
giant
measuring
exactly
seven
feet
one
and
one
half
inches
so
he
was
not
engaged
and
my
agent
returned
to
england
and
wrote
me
a
most
amusing
letter
giving
the
particulars
of
the
gigantic
interview
on
the
occasion
of
the
erection
of
a
new
engine
in
his
mill
wilson
proposed
naming
it
after
his
daughter
but
she
insisted
it
should
be
christened
barnum
and
it
was
so
done
with
considerable
ceremony
subsequently
he
introduced
a
second
engine
into
his
enlarged
mill
and
named
this
after
my
wife
a
short
time
since
i
wrote
informing
him
that
i
desired
to
give
some
of
the
foregoing
facts
in
my
book
and
asked
him
to
give
me
his
consent
and
also
to
furnish
me
some
particulars
in
regard
to
the
engines
and
the
capacity
of
his
mill
he
wrote
in
return
a
modest
letter
which
is
so
characteristic
of
my
friend
that
i
can
not
forbear
making
the
following
extracts
from
it
had
i
made
a
fortune
of
i
should
have
been
proud
of
such
a
place
in
your
book
as
albert
smith
has
in
your
autobiography
but
as
i
have
only
been
able
to
make
here
he
named
a
sum
which
in
this
country
would
be
considered
almost
a
fortune
i
feel
i
should
be
out
of
place
in
your
pages
at
all
events
if
you
mention
me
at
all
draw
it
mildly
if
you
please
the
american
war
has
made
sad
havoc
in
our
trade
and
it
is
only
by
close
attention
to
business
that
i
have
lately
been
at
all
successful
i
have
built
a
place
for
one
thousand
looms
and
have
as
you
know
put
in
a
pair
of
engines
which
i
have
named
barnum
and
each
engine
has
its
name
engraved
on
two
large
brass
plates
at
either
end
of
the
cylinder
which
has
often
caused
much
mirth
when
i
have
explained
the
circumstances
to
visitors
i
started
and
christened
charity
on
the
of
january
last
and
she
has
saved
me
per
month
in
coals
ever
since
the
steam
from
the
boiler
goes
first
to
charity
she
is
high
pressure
and
barnum
only
gets
the
steam
after
she
has
done
with
it
he
has
to
work
at
low
pressure
a
condensing
engine
and
the
result
is
a
saving
barnum
was
extravagant
when
he
took
steam
direct
but
since
i
fixed
charity
betwixt
him
and
the
boiler
he
can
only
get
what
she
gives
him
this
reminds
me
that
you
state
in
your
life
you
could
always
make
money
but
formerly
did
not
save
it
perhaps
you
never
took
care
of
it
till
charity
became
chancellor
of
exchequer
when
i
visited
you
at
the
bull
hotel
in
blackburn
you
pointed
to
general
tom
thumb
and
said
that
is
my
piece
of
goods
i
have
sold
it
hundreds
of
thousands
of
times
and
have
never
yet
delivered
it
that
was
ten
years
ago
in
if
i
had
been
doing
the
same
with
my
pieces
of
calico
i
must
have
been
wealthy
by
this
time
but
i
have
been
hammering
at
one
cotton
nail
several
months
and
as
it
did
not
offer
to
clinch
i
was
almost
tempted
to
doubt
one
of
your
rules
and
thought
i
would
drive
at
some
other
nail
but
on
reflection
i
knew
i
understood
cotton
better
than
anything
else
and
so
i
back
up
your
rule
and
stick
to
cotton
not
doubting
it
will
be
all
right
and
successful
wilson
was
one
of
the
large
class
of
english
manufacturers
who
suffered
seriously
from
the
effects
of
the
rebellion
in
the
united
states
as
an
englishman
he
could
not
have
a
patriot
s
interest
in
the
progress
of
that
terrible
struggle
but
he
made
a
practical
exhibition
of
sympathy
for
the
suffering
soldiers
in
a
pleasant
and
characteristic
manner
the
great
fair
of
the
sanitary
commission
held
in
new
york
during
the
war
affords
one
of
the
most
interesting
chapters
in
american
history
it
meant
cordial
for
the
sick
and
suffering
in
the
hospitals
and
balm
and
relief
for
the
wounded
in
the
field
none
of
those
who
visited
the
fair
will
forget
in
the
multiplicity
of
offerings
to
put
money
into
the
treasury
of
the
commission
two
monster
cakes
which
were
as
strange
in
shape
and
ornament
as
they
were
fairly
mammoth
in
their
proportions
one
of
these
great
cakes
was
covered
with
miniature
forts
ships
of
war
cannon
armies
arms
of
the
whole
panoply
of
war
and
it
excited
the
attention
of
all
visitors
this
strange
cake
was
what
is
called
in
bury
england
where
name
cake
and
custom
originated
a
simnel
cake
and
an
interesting
history
pertains
to
it
there
is
an
anniversary
in
bury
and
i
believe
only
in
that
place
in
england
called
simnel
like
many
old
observances
its
origin
is
lost
in
antiquity
but
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
which
is
simnel
sunday
everybody
in
bury
eats
simnel
cake
it
is
a
high
day
for
the
inhabitants
and
the
streets
are
thronged
with
people
during
the
preceding
week
the
shop
windows
of
the
confectioners
exhibit
a
plethora
of
large
flat
cakes
of
a
peculiar
pattern
and
of
toothsome
composition
every
confectioner
aims
to
outdo
his
rivals
in
the
bigness
of
the
one
which
nearly
fills
his
window
and
in
the
moulding
and
ornamental
accessories
a
local
description
giving
the
requisite
characteristics
says
the
great
simnel
must
be
rich
must
be
big
and
must
be
novel
in
such
is
the
simnel
cake
the
specialty
of
simnel
sunday
in
the
town
of
bury
in
old
england
and
such
was
the
monster
cake
with
its
warlike
emblems
which
attracted
so
much
attention
at
the
fair
and
added
considerably
to
the
receipts
for
the
sanitary
commission
it
was
sent
to
me
expressly
for
this
fair
by
my
friend
wilson
and
while
it
was
in
itself
a
generous
gift
it
was
doubly
so
as
coming
from
an
english
manufacturer
who
had
suffered
by
the
war
the
second
great
simnel
cake
which
stood
beside
it
in
the
fair
was
sent
to
me
personally
by
wilson
but
with
his
permission
i
took
much
pleasure
in
contributing
it
with
his
own
offering
for
the
benefit
of
our
suffering
soldiers
it
may
thus
be
seen
that
my
friend
wilson
is
not
only
an
enterprising
englishman
but
that
he
is
also
a
generous
man
one
who
in
a
great
struggle
like
the
late
civil
war
in
america
could
sincerely
sympathize
with
suffering
humanity
notwithstanding
as
he
expressed
it
the
american
war
has
made
sad
havoc
in
our
his
soul
soars
above
pounds
shillings
and
pence
and
i
take
great
pleasure
in
expressing
admiration
for
a
gentleman
of
such
marked
enterprise
philanthropy
and
integrity

again
another
word
for
barnum
in
i
returned
to
the
united
states
during
my
last
visit
abroad
i
had
secured
many
novelties
for
the
museum
including
the
albino
family
which
i
engaged
at
amsterdam
and
thiodon
s
mechanical
theatre
which
i
found
at
southampton
beside
purchasing
many
curiosities
these
things
all
afforded
me
a
liberal
commission
and
thus
by
constant
and
earnest
effort
i
made
much
money
besides
what
i
derived
from
the
tom
thumb
exhibitions
my
lectures
and
other
enterprises
all
of
this
money
as
well
as
my
wife
s
income
and
a
considerable
sum
raised
by
selling
a
portion
of
her
property
was
faithfully
devoted
to
the
one
great
object
of
my
life
at
that
period
my
extrication
from
those
crushing
clock
debts
i
worked
and
i
saved
when
my
wife
and
youngest
daughter
were
not
boarding
in
bridgeport
they
lived
frugally
in
the
suburbs
in
a
small
house
which
was
hired
at
the
rate
of
a
year
i
had
now
been
struggling
about
four
years
with
the
difficulties
of
my
one
great
financial
mistake
and
the
end
still
seemed
to
be
far
off
i
felt
that
the
land
purchased
by
my
wife
in
east
bridgeport
at
the
assignees
sale
would
after
a
while
increase
rapidly
in
value
and
on
the
strength
of
this
expectation
more
money
was
borrowed
for
the
sake
of
taking
up
the
clock
notes
and
some
of
the
east
bridgeport
property
was
sold
in
single
lots
the
proceeds
going
to
the
same
object
at
last
in
march
all
the
clock
indebtedness
was
satisfactorily
extinguished
excepting
some
which
i
had
bound
myself
to
take
up
within
a
certain
number
of
months
my
friend
james
johnson
guaranteeing
my
bond
to
that
effect
johnson
was
by
far
my
most
effective
agent
in
working
me
through
these
clock
troubles
and
in
aiding
to
bring
them
to
a
successful
conclusion
another
man
however
who
pretended
to
be
my
friend
and
whom
i
liberally
paid
to
assist
in
bringing
me
out
of
my
difficulties
gained
my
confidence
possessed
himself
of
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
situation
of
my
affairs
and
then
coolly
proposed
to
johnson
to
counteract
all
my
efforts
to
get
out
of
debt
and
to
divide
between
them
what
could
be
got
out
of
my
estate
failing
in
this
the
scoundrel
taking
advantage
of
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
slyly
arranged
with
the
owners
of
clock
notes
to
hold
on
to
them
and
share
with
him
whatever
they
might
gain
by
adopting
his
advice
he
assuming
that
he
knew
all
my
secrets
and
that
i
would
soon
come
out
all
right
again
thus
i
had
to
contend
with
foes
from
within
as
well
as
without
but
the
spotting
of
this
traitor
was
worth
something
for
it
opened
my
eyes
in
relation
to
former
transactions
in
which
i
had
intrusted
large
sums
of
money
to
his
hands
and
it
put
me
on
guard
for
the
future
but
i
bear
no
malice
towards
him
i
only
pity
him
as
i
do
any
man
who
knows
so
little
of
the
true
road
to
contentment
and
happiness
as
to
think
that
it
lies
in
the
direction
of
dishonesty
i
need
not
dwell
upon
the
details
of
what
i
suffered
from
the
doings
of
those
heartless
unscrupulous
men
who
fatten
upon
the
misfortunes
of
others
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
triumphed
over
them
and
all
my
troubles
i
was
once
more
a
free
man
at
last
i
was
able
to
make
proclamation
that
richard
s
himself
again
that
barnum
was
once
more
on
his
feet
the
museum
had
not
flourished
greatly
in
the
hands
of
greenwood
butler
and
so
when
i
was
free
i
was
quite
willing
to
take
back
the
property
upon
terms
that
were
entirely
satisfactory
to
them
i
had
once
retired
from
the
establishment
a
man
of
independent
fortune
i
was
now
ready
to
return
to
make
if
possible
another
fortune
on
the
of
march
butler
greenwood
signed
an
agreement
to
sell
and
deliver
to
me
on
the
following
saturday
march
their
good
will
and
entire
interest
in
the
museum
collection
this
fact
was
thoroughly
circulated
and
it
was
everywhere
announced
in
blazing
posters
placards
and
advertisements
which
were
headed
barnum
on
his
feet
it
was
furthermore
stated
that
the
museum
would
be
closed
march
for
one
week
for
repairs
and
general
renovation
to
be
march
under
the
management
and
proprietorship
of
its
original
owner
it
was
also
announced
that
on
the
night
of
closing
i
would
address
the
audience
from
the
stage
the
american
museum
decorated
on
that
occasion
as
on
holidays
with
a
brilliant
display
of
flags
and
banners
was
filled
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
i
experienced
profound
delight
at
seeing
hundreds
of
old
friends
of
both
sexes
in
the
audience
i
lacked
but
four
months
of
being
fifty
years
of
age
but
i
felt
all
the
vigor
and
ambition
that
fired
me
when
i
first
took
possession
of
the
premises
twenty
years
before
and
i
was
confident
that
the
various
experiences
of
that
score
of
years
would
be
valuable
to
me
in
my
second
effort
to
secure
an
independence
at
the
rising
of
the
curtain
and
before
the
play
commenced
i
stepped
on
the
stage
and
was
received
by
the
large
and
brilliant
audience
with
an
enthusiasm
far
surpassing
anything
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
experienced
or
witnessed
in
a
public
career
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
indeed
this
tremendous
demonstration
nearly
broke
me
down
and
my
voice
faltered
and
tears
came
to
my
eyes
as
i
thought
of
this
magnificent
conclusion
to
the
trials
and
struggles
of
the
past
four
years
recovering
myself
however
i
bowed
my
grateful
acknowledgments
for
the
reception
and
addressed
the
audience
as
follows
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
should
be
more
or
less
than
human
if
i
could
meet
this
unexpected
and
overwhelming
testimonial
at
your
hands
without
the
deepest
emotion
my
own
personal
connection
with
the
museum
is
now
resumed
and
i
avail
myself
of
the
circumstance
to
say
why
it
is
so
never
did
i
feel
stronger
in
my
worldly
prosperity
than
in
september
three
months
later
i
was
so
deeply
embarrassed
that
i
felt
certain
of
nothing
except
the
uncertainty
of
everything
a
combination
of
singular
efforts
and
circumstances
tempted
me
to
put
faith
in
a
certain
clock
manufacturing
company
and
i
placed
my
signature
to
papers
which
ultimately
broke
me
down
after
nearly
five
years
of
hard
struggle
to
keep
my
head
above
water
i
have
touched
bottom
at
last
and
here
i
am
happy
to
announce
that
i
have
waded
ashore
every
clock
debt
of
which
i
have
any
knowledge
has
been
provided
for
perhaps
after
the
troubles
and
turmoils
i
have
experienced
i
should
feel
no
desire
to
in
the
excitements
of
business
but
a
man
like
myself
less
than
fifty
years
of
age
and
enjoying
robust
health
is
scarcely
old
enough
to
be
embalmed
and
put
in
a
glass
case
in
the
museum
as
one
of
its
million
of
curiosities
it
is
better
to
wear
out
than
rust
besides
if
a
man
of
active
temperament
is
not
busy
he
is
apt
to
get
into
mischief
to
avoid
evil
therefore
and
since
business
activity
is
a
necessity
of
my
nature
here
i
am
once
more
in
the
museum
and
among
those
with
whom
i
have
been
so
long
and
so
pleasantly
identified
i
am
confident
of
a
cordial
welcome
and
hence
feel
some
claim
to
your
indulgence
while
i
briefly
allude
to
the
means
of
my
present
deliverance
from
utter
financial
ruin
need
i
say
in
the
first
place
that
i
am
somewhat
indebted
to
the
forbearance
of
generous
creditors
in
the
next
place
permit
me
to
speak
of
sympathizing
friends
whose
volunteered
loans
and
exertions
vastly
aided
my
rescue
when
my
day
of
sorrow
came
i
first
paid
or
secured
every
debt
i
owed
of
a
personal
nature
this
done
i
felt
bound
in
honor
to
give
up
all
of
my
property
that
remained
towards
liquidating
my
clock
i
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
trustees
and
receivers
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
clock
creditors
but
at
the
forced
sale
of
my
connecticut
real
estate
there
was
a
purchaser
behind
the
screen
of
whom
the
world
had
little
knowledge
in
the
day
of
my
prosperity
i
made
over
to
my
wife
much
valuable
property
including
the
lease
of
this
museum
building
a
lease
then
having
about
years
to
run
and
enhanced
in
value
to
more
than
double
its
original
worth
i
sold
the
museum
collection
to
greenwood
and
butler
subject
to
my
wife
s
separate
interest
in
the
lease
and
she
has
received
more
than
eighty
thousand
dollars
over
and
above
the
sums
paid
to
the
owners
of
the
building
instead
of
selfishly
applying
this
amount
to
private
purposes
my
family
lived
with
a
due
regard
to
economy
and
the
savings
strictly
belonging
to
my
wife
were
devoted
to
buying
in
portions
of
my
estate
at
the
assignees
sales
and
to
purchasing
clock
notes
bearing
my
indorsements
the
christian
name
of
my
wife
is
charity
i
may
well
acknowledge
therefore
that
i
am
not
only
a
proper
subject
of
charity
but
that
without
charity
i
am
but
ladies
and
gentlemen
while
charity
thus
labored
in
my
behalf
faith
and
hope
were
not
idle
i
have
been
anything
but
indolent
during
the
last
four
years
driven
from
pillar
to
post
and
annoyed
beyond
description
by
all
sorts
of
legal
claims
and
writs
i
was
perusing
protests
and
summonses
by
day
and
dreaming
of
clocks
run
down
by
night
my
head
was
ever
whizzing
with
dislocated
and
broken
my
whole
mind
and
my
credit
was
running
upon
tick
and
everything
pressing
on
me
like
a
dead
weight
in
this
state
of
affairs
i
felt
that
i
was
of
no
use
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
so
giving
the
pendulum
a
swing
and
seizing
time
by
the
forelock
i
went
to
europe
there
i
furtively
pulled
the
wires
of
several
exhibitions
among
which
that
of
tom
thumb
may
be
mentioned
for
example
i
managed
a
variety
of
musical
and
commercial
speculations
in
great
britain
germany
and
holland
these
enterprises
together
with
the
net
profits
of
my
public
lectures
enabled
me
to
remit
large
sums
to
confidential
agents
for
the
purchase
of
my
obligations
in
this
manner
i
quietly
extinguished
little
by
little
every
dollar
of
my
clock
liabilities
i
could
not
have
achieved
this
difficult
feat
however
without
the
able
assistance
of
enthusiastic
friends
and
among
the
chief
of
them
let
me
gratefully
acknowledge
the
invaluable
services
of
james
johnson
a
gentleman
of
wealth
in
bridgeport
connecticut
other
gentlemen
have
been
generous
with
me
some
have
loaned
me
large
sums
without
security
and
have
placed
me
under
obligations
which
must
ever
command
my
honest
gratitude
but
johnson
has
been
a
friend
indeed
for
he
has
been
truly
a
friend
in
you
must
not
infer
from
what
i
have
said
that
i
have
completely
recovered
from
the
stunning
blow
to
which
i
was
subjected
four
years
ago
i
have
lost
more
in
the
way
of
tens
of
thousands
yes
hundreds
of
thousands
than
i
care
to
remember
a
valuable
portion
of
my
real
estate
in
connecticut
however
has
been
preserved
and
as
i
feel
all
the
ardor
of
twenty
years
ago
and
the
prospect
here
is
so
flattering
my
heart
is
animated
with
the
hope
of
ultimately
by
enterprise
and
activity
obliterating
unpleasant
reminiscences
and
retrieving
the
losses
of
the
past
experience
too
has
taught
me
not
only
that
even
in
the
matter
of
money
enough
is
as
good
as
a
feast
but
that
there
are
in
this
world
some
things
vastly
better
than
the
almighty
dollar
possibly
i
may
contemplate
at
times
the
painful
day
when
i
said
othello
s
occupation
s
gone
but
i
shall
more
frequently
cherish
the
memory
of
this
moment
when
i
am
permitted
to
announce
that
richard
s
himself
many
people
have
wondered
that
a
man
considered
so
acute
as
myself
should
have
been
deluded
into
embarrassments
like
mine
and
not
a
few
have
declared
in
short
metre
that
barnum
was
a
i
can
only
reply
that
i
never
made
pretensions
to
the
sharpness
of
a
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
so
entirely
lose
confidence
in
human
nature
as
to
consider
every
man
a
scamp
by
instinct
or
a
rogue
by
necessity
it
is
better
to
be
deceived
sometimes
than
to
distrust
always
says
lord
bacon
and
i
agree
with
him
experience
is
said
to
be
a
hard
schoolmaster
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
feel
that
this
great
lesson
in
adversity
has
not
brought
forth
fruits
of
some
value
i
needed
the
discipline
this
tribulation
has
given
me
and
i
really
feel
after
all
that
this
like
many
other
apparent
evils
was
only
a
blessing
in
disguise
indeed
i
may
mention
that
the
very
clock
factory
which
i
built
in
bridgeport
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
hundreds
of
workmen
to
that
city
has
been
purchased
and
quadrupled
in
size
by
the
wheeler
and
wilson
sewing
machine
company
and
is
now
filled
with
intelligent
new
england
mechanics
whose
families
add
two
thousand
to
the
population
and
who
are
doing
a
great
work
in
building
up
and
beautifying
that
flourishing
city
so
that
the
same
concern
which
prostrated
me
seems
destined
as
a
most
important
agent
towards
my
recuperation
i
am
certain
that
the
popular
sympathy
has
been
with
me
from
the
beginning
and
this
together
with
a
consciousness
of
rectitude
is
more
than
an
offset
to
all
the
vicissitudes
to
which
i
have
been
subjected
in
conclusion
i
beg
to
assure
you
and
the
public
that
my
chief
pleasure
while
health
and
strength
are
spared
me
will
be
to
cater
for
your
and
their
healthy
amusement
and
instruction
in
future
such
capabilities
as
i
possess
will
be
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
this
museum
as
a
popular
place
of
family
resort
in
which
all
that
is
novel
and
interesting
shall
be
gathered
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
and
which
ladies
and
children
may
visit
at
all
times
unattended
without
danger
of
encountering
anything
of
an
objectionable
nature
the
dramas
introduced
in
the
lecture
room
will
never
contain
a
profane
expression
or
a
vulgar
allusion
on
the
contrary
their
tendency
will
always
be
to
encourage
virtue
and
frown
upon
vice
i
have
established
connections
in
europe
which
will
enable
me
to
produce
here
a
succession
of
interesting
novelties
otherwise
inaccessible
although
i
shall
be
personally
present
much
of
the
time
and
hope
to
meet
many
of
my
old
acquaintances
as
well
as
to
form
many
new
ones
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
to
learn
that
i
have
the
services
of
one
of
the
late
proprietors
and
the
active
manager
of
this
museum
john
greenwood
as
he
is
a
modest
gentleman
who
would
be
the
last
to
praise
himself
allow
me
to
add
that
he
is
one
to
whose
successful
qualities
as
a
caterer
for
the
popular
entertainments
the
crowds
that
have
often
filled
this
building
may
well
bear
testimony
but
more
than
this
he
is
the
unobtrusive
one
to
whose
integrity
diligence
and
devotion
i
owe
much
of
my
present
position
of
greenwood
will
hereafter
act
as
assistant
manager
while
his
late
butler
has
engaged
in
another
branch
of
business
once
more
thanking
you
all
for
your
kind
welcome
i
bid
you
till
the
an
affectionate
this
speech
was
received
with
almost
tumultuous
applause
at
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
i
was
now
once
more
before
the
public
with
the
promise
to
put
on
a
full
head
of
steam
to
rush
things
to
give
double
or
treble
the
amount
of
attractions
ever
before
offered
at
the
museum
and
to
devote
all
my
own
time
and
services
to
the
enterprise
in
return
i
asked
that
the
public
should
give
my
efforts
the
patronage
they
merited
and
the
public
took
me
at
my
word
the
daily
number
of
visitors
at
once
more
than
doubled
and
my
exertions
to
gratify
them
with
rapid
changes
and
novelties
never
tired
the
announcement
that
richard
s
himself
again
that
i
was
at
last
out
of
the
financial
entanglement
was
variously
received
in
the
community
that
portion
of
the
press
which
had
followed
me
with
abuse
when
i
was
down
under
the
belief
that
my
case
was
past
recovery
were
chary
in
allusions
to
the
new
state
of
things
or
passed
them
over
without
comment
the
sycophants
always
knew
i
would
get
up
again
and
said
so
at
the
time
the
many
and
noble
journals
which
had
stood
by
me
and
upheld
me
in
my
misfortunes
were
of
course
rejoiced
and
their
words
of
sincere
congratulation
gave
me
a
higher
satisfaction
than
i
have
power
of
language
to
acknowledge
letters
of
congratulation
came
in
upon
me
from
every
quarter
friendly
hands
that
had
never
been
withheld
during
the
long
period
of
my
misfortune
were
now
extended
with
a
still
heartier
grip
i
never
knew
till
now
the
warmth
and
number
of
my
friends
my
editorial
friend
robert
bonner
of
the
new
york
sincerely
congratulated
me
upon
my
full
and
complete
restoration
i
had
some
new
plays
which
were
adapted
from
very
popular
stories
which
had
been
written
for
bonner
s
paper
and
i
went
to
him
to
purchase
if
i
could
the
large
cuts
he
had
used
to
advertise
these
stories
in
his
street
placards
he
at
once
generously
offered
to
lend
them
to
me
as
long
as
i
wished
to
use
them
and
tendered
me
his
services
in
any
way
bonner
was
the
boldest
of
advertisers
following
me
closely
in
the
field
in
which
i
was
the
pioneer
and
to
his
judicious
use
of
printers
ink
he
owes
the
fine
fortune
which
he
so
worthily
deserves
and
enjoys
nor
must
i
neglect
to
state
that
a
large
number
of
my
creditors
who
held
the
clock
notes
proved
very
magnanimous
in
taking
into
consideration
the
gross
deception
which
had
put
me
in
their
power
not
a
few
of
them
said
to
me
in
substance
you
never
supposed
you
had
made
yourself
liable
for
this
debt
you
were
deluded
into
it
it
is
not
right
that
it
should
be
held
over
you
to
keep
you
hopelessly
down
take
it
and
pay
me
such
percentage
as
under
the
circumstances
it
is
possible
for
you
to
but
for
such
men
and
such
consideration
i
fear
i
should
never
have
got
on
my
feet
again
and
of
the
many
who
rejoiced
in
my
bettered
fortune
not
a
few
were
of
this
class
of
my
creditors
my
old
friend
the
boston
evening
which
printed
a
few
cheering
poetical
lines
of
consolation
and
hope
when
i
was
down
now
gave
me
the
following
from
the
same
graceful
pen

glowing
words
of
congratulation
at
my
rise

whether
as

of
the

itself
or
as
outside
accessories
or
accompaniments
among
the
first
to
give
me
a
call
with
attractions
sure
to
prove
a
success
was
james
adams
of
fame
this
extraordinary
man
was
eminently
what
is
called
a
he
was
universally
known
as
grizzly
adams
from
the
fact
that
he
had
captured
a
great
many
grizzly
bears
at
the
risk
and
cost
of
fearful
encounters
and
perils
he
was
brave
and
with
his
bravery
there
was
enough
of
the
romantic
in
his
nature
to
make
him
a
real
hero
for
many
years
a
hunter
and
trapper
in
the
rocky
and
sierra
nevada
mountains
he
acquired
a
recklessness
which
added
to
his
natural
invincible
courage
rendered
him
one
of
the
most
striking
men
of
the
age
and
he
was
emphatically
a
man
of
pluck
a
month
after
i
had
the
museum
he
arrived
in
new
york
with
his
famous
collection
of
california
animals
captured
by
himself
consisting
of
twenty
or
thirty
immense
grizzly
bears
at
the
head
of
which
stood
old
sampson
together
with
several
wolves
half
a
dozen
different
species
of
california
bears
california
lions
tigers
buffalo
elk
and
old
neptune
the
great
from
the
pacific
old
adams
had
trained
all
these
monsters
so
that
with
him
they
were
as
docile
as
kittens
though
many
of
the
most
ferocious
among
them
would
attack
a
stranger
without
hesitation
if
he
came
within
their
grasp
in
fact
the
training
of
these
animals
was
no
fool
s
play
as
old
adams
learned
to
his
cost
for
the
terrific
blows
which
he
received
from
time
to
time
while
teaching
them
docility
finally
cost
him
his
life

on
me
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
new
york
he
was
dressed
in
his
hunter
s
suit
of
buckskin
trimmed
with
the
skins
and
bordered
with
the
hanging
tails
of
small
rocky
mountain
animals
his
cap
consisting
of
the
skin
of
a
wolf
s
head
and
shoulders
from
which
depended
several
tails
and
under
which
appeared
his
stiff
bushy
gray
hair
and
his
long
white
grizzly
beard
in
fact
old
adams
was
quite
as
much
of
a
show
as
his
beasts
they
had
come
around
cape
horn
on
the
clipper
ship
golden
fleece
and
a
sea
voyage
of
three
and
a
half
months
had
probably
not
added
much
to
the
beauty
or
neat
appearance
of
illustration
adams
and
his
the
old
during
our
conversation
grizzly
adams
took
off
his
cap
and
showed
me
the
top
of
his
head
his
skull
was
literally
broken
in
it
had
on
various
occasions
been
struck
by
the
fearful
paws
of
his
grizzly
students
and
the
last
blow
from
the
bear
called
general
fremont
had
laid
open
his
brain
so
that
its
workings
were
plainly
visible
i
remarked
that
i
thought
it
was
a
dangerous
wound
and
might
possibly
prove
fatal
yes
replied
adams
that
will
fix
me
out
it
had
nearly
healed
but
old
fremont
opened
it
for
me
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
before
i
left
california
and
he
did
his
business
so
thoroughly
i
m
a
man
however
i
reckon
i
may
live
six
months
or
a
year
this
was
spoken
as
coolly
as
if
he
had
been
talking
about
the
life
of
a
dog
the
immediate
object
of
old
adams
in
calling
upon
me
was
this
i
had
purchased
a
week
previously
interest
in
his
california
menagerie
from
a
man
who
had
come
by
way
of
the
isthmus
from
california
and
who
claimed
to
own
an
equal
interest
with
adams
in
the
show
adams
declared
that
the
man
had
only
advanced
him
some
money
and
did
not
possess
the
right
to
sell
half
of
the
concern
however
the
man
held
a
bill
of
sale
for
half
of
the
california
menagerie
and
old
adams
finally
consented
to
accept
me
as
an
equal
partner
in
the
speculation
saying
that
he
guessed
i
could
do
the
managing
part
and
he
would
show
up
the
animals
i
obtained
a
canvas
tent
and
erecting
it
on
the
present
site
of
wallack
s
theatre
adams
there
opened
his
novel
california
menagerie
on
the
morning
of
opening
a
band
of
music
preceded
a
procession
of
animal
cages
down
broadway
and
up
the
bowery
old
adams
dressed
in
his
hunting
costume
heading
the
line
with
a
platform
wagon
on
which
were
placed
three
immense
grizzly
bears
two
of
which
he
held
by
chains
while
he
was
mounted
on
the
back
of
the
largest
grizzly
which
stood
in
the
centre
and
was
not
secured
in
any
manner
whatever
this
was
the
bear
known
as
general
fremont
and
so
docile
had
he
become
that
adams
said
he
had
used
him
as
a
to
carry
his
cooking
and
hunting
apparatus
through
the
mountains
for
six
months
and
had
ridden
him
hundreds
of
miles
but
apparently
docile
as
were
many
of
these
animals
there
was
not
one
among
them
that
would
not
occasionally
give
adams
a
sly
blow
or
a
sly
bite
when
a
good
chance
offered
hence
old
adams
was
but
a
wreck
of
his
former
self
and
expressed
pretty
nearly
the
truth
when
he
said
mr
barnum
i
am
not
the
man
i
was
five
years
ago
then
i
felt
able
to
stand
the
hug
of
any
grizzly
living
and
was
always
glad
to
encounter
single
handed
any
sort
of
an
animal
that
dared
present
himself
but
i
have
been
beaten
to
a
jelly
torn
almost
limb
from
limb
and
nearly
chawed
up
and
spit
out
by
these
treacherous
grizzly
bears
however
i
am
good
for
a
few
months
yet
and
by
that
time
i
hope
we
shall
gain
enough
to
make
my
old
woman
comfortable
for
i
have
been
absent
from
her
some
his
wife
came
from
massachusetts
to
new
york
and
nursed
him
johns
dressed
his
wounds
every
day
and
not
only
told
adams
he
could
never
recover
but
assured
his
friends
that
probably
a
very
few
weeks
would
lay
him
in
his
grave
but
adams
was
as
firm
as
adamant
and
as
resolute
as
a
lion
among
the
thousands
who
saw
him
dressed
in
his
grotesque
hunter
s
suit
and
witnessed
the
seeming
vigor
with
which
he
performed
the
savage
monsters
beating
and
whipping
them
into
apparently
the
most
perfect
docility
probably
not
one
suspected
that
this
rough
fierce
looking
powerful
as
he
appeared
to
be
was
suffering
intense
pain
from
his
broken
skull
and
fevered
system
and
that
nothing
kept
him
from
stretching
himself
on
his
but
his
most
indomitable
and
extraordinary
will
old
adams
liked
to
astonish
others
as
he
often
did
with
his
astounding
stories
but
no
one
could
astonish
him
he
had
seen
everything
and
knew
everything
and
i
was
anxious
to
get
a
chance
of
exposing
this
weak
point
to
him
a
fit
occasion
soon
presented
itself
one
day
while
engaged
in
my
office
at
the
museum
a
man
with
marked
teutonic
features
and
accent
approached
the
door
and
asked
if
i
would
like
to
buy
a
pair
of
living
golden
pigeons
yes
i
replied
i
would
like
a
flock
of
golden
pigeons
if
i
could
buy
them
for
their
weight
in
silver
for
there
are
no
golden
pigeons
in
existence
unless
they
are
made
from
the
pure
you
shall
see
some
golden
pigeons
alive
he
replied
at
the
same
time
entering
my
office
and
closing
the
door
after
him
he
then
removed
the
lid
from
a
small
basket
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
and
sure
enough
there
were
snugly
ensconced
a
pair
of
beautiful
living
pigeons
as
yellow
as
saffron
and
as
bright
as
a
fresh
from
the
mint
i
confess
i
was
somewhat
staggered
at
this
sight
and
quickly
asked
the
man
where
those
birds
came
from
a
dull
lazy
smile
crawled
over
the
sober
face
of
my
german
visitor
as
he
replied
in
a
slow
guttural
tone
of
voice
what
you
think
yourself
catching
his
meaning
i
quickly
replied
i
think
it
is
a
of
course
i
know
you
will
say
so
because
you
forstha
such
things
so
i
shall
not
try
to
humbug
you
i
have
color
them
on
further
inquiry
i
learned
that
this
german
was
a
chemist
and
that
he
possessed
the
art
of
coloring
birds
any
hue
desired
and
yet
retain
a
natural
gloss
on
the
feathers
which
gave
every
shade
the
appearance
of
reality
i
can
paint
a
green
pigeon
or
a
blue
pigeon
a
gray
pigeon
or
a
black
pigeon
a
brown
pigeon
or
a
pigeon
half
blue
or
half
green
said
the
german
and
if
you
prefer
it
i
can
paint
them
pink
or
purple
or
give
you
a
little
of
each
color
and
make
you
a
rainbow
the
rainbow
pigeon
did
not
strike
me
as
particularly
desirable
but
thinking
here
was
a
good
chance
to
catch
grizzly
adams
i
bought
the
pair
of
golden
pigeons
for
ten
dollars
and
sent
them
up
to
the
happy
family
where
i
knew
adams
would
soon
see
them
marked
golden
pigeons
from
taylor
the
great
pacificator
who
had
charge
of
the
happy
family
soon
came
down
in
a
state
of
excitement
really
barnum
said
he
i
could
not
think
of
putting
those
elegant
golden
pigeons
into
the
happy
family
they
are
too
valuable
a
bird
and
they
might
get
injured
they
are
by
far
the
most
beautiful
pigeons
i
ever
saw
and
as
they
are
so
rare
i
would
not
jeopardize
their
lives
for
well
said
i
you
may
put
them
in
a
separate
cage
properly
monsieur
guillaudeu
the
naturalist
and
taxidermist
of
the
museum
had
been
attached
to
that
establishment
since
the
year
it
was
founded
in
he
is
a
frenchman
and
has
read
nearly
everything
upon
natural
history
that
was
ever
published
in
his
own
or
in
the
english
language
when
he
saw
the
golden
pigeons
from
california
he
was
considerably
astonished
he
examined
them
with
great
delight
for
half
an
hour
expatiating
upon
their
beautiful
color
and
the
near
resemblance
which
every
feature
bore
to
the
american
pigeon
he
soon
came
to
my
office
and
said
mr
barnum
these
golden
pigeons
are
superb
but
they
can
not
be
from
california
audubon
mentions
no
such
bird
in
his
work
upon
american
i
told
him
he
had
better
take
audubon
home
with
him
that
night
and
perhaps
by
studying
him
attentively
he
would
see
occasion
to
change
his
mind
the
next
day
the
old
naturalist
called
at
my
office
and
remarked
mr
barnum
those
pigeons
are
a
more
rare
bird
than
you
imagine
they
are
not
mentioned
by
linnÃ¦us
cuvier
goldsmith
or
any
other
writer
on
natural
history
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
discover
i
expect
they
must
have
come
from
some
unexplored
portion
of
never
mind
i
replied
we
may
get
more
light
on
the
subject
perhaps
before
long
we
will
continue
to
label
them
california
pigeons
until
we
can
fix
their
nativity
the
next
morning
old
grizzly
adams
passed
through
the
museum
when
his
eyes
fell
on
the
golden
california
he
looked
a
moment
and
doubtless
admired
he
soon
after
came
to
my
office
mr
barnum
said
he
you
must
let
me
have
those
california
i
can
t
spare
them
i
replied
but
you
must
spare
them
all
the
birds
and
animals
from
california
ought
to
be
together
you
own
half
of
my
california
menagerie
and
you
must
lend
me
those
mr
adams
they
are
too
rare
and
valuable
a
bird
to
be
hawked
about
in
that
oh
don
t
be
a
fool
replied
adams
rare
bird
indeed
why
they
are
just
as
common
in
california
as
any
other
pigeon
i
could
have
brought
a
hundred
of
them
from
san
francisco
if
i
had
thought
of
but
why
did
you
not
think
of
it
i
asked
with
a
suppressed
smile
because
they
are
so
common
there
said
adams
i
did
not
think
they
would
be
any
curiosity
here
i
have
eaten
them
in
hundreds
of
times
and
have
shot
them
by
the
thousands
i
was
ready
to
burst
with
laughter
to
see
how
readily
adams
swallowed
the
bait
but
maintaining
the
most
rigid
gravity
i
replied
oh
well
adams
if
they
are
really
so
common
in
california
you
had
probably
better
take
them
and
you
may
write
over
and
have
half
a
dozen
pairs
sent
to
me
for
the
all
right
said
adams
i
will
send
over
to
a
friend
in
san
francisco
and
you
shall
have
them
here
in
a
couple
of
i
told
adams
that
for
certain
reasons
i
would
prefer
to
have
him
change
the
label
so
as
to
have
it
read
golden
pigeons
from
well
i
will
call
them
what
you
like
said
adams
i
suppose
they
are
probably
about
as
plenty
in
australia
as
they
are
in
six
or
eight
weeks
after
this
incident
i
was
in
the
california
menagerie
and
noticed
that
the
golden
pigeons
had
assumed
a
frightfully
mottled
appearance
their
feathers
had
grown
out
and
they
were
half
white
adams
had
been
so
busy
with
his
bears
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
change
i
called
him
up
to
the
pigeon
cage
and
remarked
mr
adams
i
fear
you
will
lose
your
golden
pigeons
they
must
be
very
sick
i
observe
they
are
turning
quite
adams
looked
at
them
a
moment
with
astonishment
then
turning
to
me
and
seeing
that
i
could
not
suppress
a
smile
he
indignantly
exclaimed
blast
the
golden
pigeons
you
had
better
take
them
back
to
the
museum
you
can
t
humbug
me
with
your
painted
pigeons
this
was
too
much
and
i
laughed
till
i
cried
to
witness
the
mixed
look
of
astonishment
and
vexation
which
marked
the
grizzly
features
of
old
adams
after
the
exhibition
on
thirteenth
street
and
broadway
had
been
open
six
weeks
the
doctor
insisted
that
adams
should
sell
out
his
share
in
the
animals
and
settle
up
all
his
worldly
affairs
for
he
assured
him
that
he
was
growing
weaker
every
day
and
his
earthly
existence
must
soon
terminate
i
shall
live
a
good
deal
longer
than
you
doctors
think
for
replied
adams
doggedly
and
then
seeming
after
all
to
realize
the
truth
of
the
doctor
s
assertion
he
turned
to
me
and
said
well
barnum
you
must
buy
me
he
named
his
price
for
his
half
of
the
show
and
i
accepted
his
offer
we
had
arranged
to
exhibit
the
bears
in
connecticut
and
massachusetts
during
the
summer
in
connection
with
a
circus
and
adams
insisted
that
i
should
hire
him
to
travel
for
the
season
and
exhibit
the
bears
in
their
curious
performances
he
offered
to
go
for
per
week
and
travelling
expenses
of
himself
and
wife
i
replied
that
i
would
gladly
engage
him
as
long
as
he
could
stand
it
but
i
advised
him
to
give
up
business
and
go
to
his
home
in
massachusetts
for
i
remarked
you
are
growing
weaker
every
day
and
at
best
can
not
stand
it
more
than
a
what
will
you
give
me
extra
if
i
will
travel
and
exhibit
the
bears
every
day
for
ten
weeks
added
old
adams
eagerly
five
hundred
dollars
i
replied
with
a
laugh
done
exclaimed
adams
i
will
do
it
so
draw
up
an
agreement
to
that
effect
at
once
but
mind
you
draw
it
payable
to
my
wife
for
i
may
be
too
weak
to
attend
to
business
after
the
ten
weeks
are
up
and
if
i
perform
my
part
of
the
contract
i
want
her
to
get
the
without
any
i
drew
up
a
contract
to
pay
him
per
week
for
his
services
and
if
he
continued
to
exhibit
the
bears
for
ten
consecutive
weeks
i
was
then
to
hand
him
or
his
wife
extra
you
have
lost
your
exclaimed
adams
on
taking
the
contract
for
i
am
bound
to
live
and
earn
i
hope
you
may
with
all
my
heart
and
a
hundred
years
more
if
you
desire
it
i
replied
call
me
a
fool
if
i
don
t
earn
the
exclaimed
adams
with
a
triumphant
laugh
the
show
started
off
in
a
few
days
and
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
i
met
it
at
hartford
connecticut
well
said
i
adams
you
seem
to
stand
it
pretty
well
i
hope
you
and
your
wife
are
comfortable
yes
he
replied
with
a
laugh
and
you
may
as
well
try
to
be
comfortable
too
for
your
is
a
all
right
i
replied
i
hope
you
will
grow
better
every
but
i
saw
by
his
pale
face
and
other
indications
that
he
was
rapidly
failing
in
three
weeks
more
i
met
him
again
at
new
bedford
massachusetts
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
he
could
not
live
a
week
for
his
eyes
were
glassy
and
his
hands
trembled
but
his
pluck
was
as
great
as
ever
this
hot
weather
is
pretty
bad
for
me
he
said
but
my
ten
weeks
are
half
expired
and
i
am
good
for
your
and
probably
a
month
or
two
this
was
said
with
as
much
bravado
as
if
he
was
offering
to
bet
upon
a
i
offered
to
pay
him
half
of
the
if
he
would
give
up
and
go
home
but
he
peremptorily
declined
making
any
compromise
whatever
i
met
him
the
ninth
week
in
boston
he
had
failed
considerably
since
i
last
saw
him
but
he
still
continued
to
exhibit
the
bears
although
he
was
too
weak
to
lead
them
in
and
he
chuckled
over
his
almost
certain
triumph
i
laughed
in
return
and
sincerely
congratulated
him
on
his
nerve
and
probable
success
i
remained
with
him
until
the
tenth
week
was
finished
and
handed
him
his
he
took
it
with
a
leer
of
satisfaction
and
remarked
that
he
was
sorry
i
was
a
teetotaler
for
he
would
like
to
stand
treat
just
before
the
menagerie
left
new
york
i
had
paid
for
a
new
hunting
suit
made
of
beaver
skins
similar
to
the
one
which
adams
had
worn
this
i
intended
for
herr
driesbach
the
animal
tamer
who
was
engaged
by
me
to
take
the
place
of
adams
whenever
he
should
be
compelled
to
give
up
adams
on
starting
from
new
york
asked
me
to
loan
this
new
dress
to
him
to
perform
in
once
in
a
while
in
a
fair
day
where
he
had
a
large
audience
for
his
own
costume
was
considerably
soiled
i
did
so
and
now
when
i
handed
him
his
he
remarked
mr
barnum
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
give
me
this
new
hunting
dress
oh
no
i
replied
i
got
that
for
your
successor
who
will
exhibit
the
bears
besides
you
have
no
possible
use
for
now
don
t
be
mean
but
lend
me
the
dress
if
you
won
t
give
it
to
me
for
i
want
to
wear
it
home
to
my
native
i
could
not
refuse
the
poor
old
man
anything
and
i
therefore
replied
well
adams
i
will
lend
you
the
dress
but
you
will
send
it
back
to
me
yes
when
i
have
done
with
it
he
replied
with
an
evident
chuckle
of
triumph
i
thought
to
myself
he
will
soon
be
done
with
it
and
replied
that
s
all
a
new
idea
evidently
struck
him
for
with
a
brightening
look
of
satisfaction
he
said
now
barnum
you
have
made
a
good
thing
out
of
the
california
menagerie
and
so
have
i
but
you
will
make
a
heap
more
so
if
you
won
t
give
me
this
new
hunter
s
dress
just
draw
a
little
writing
and
sign
it
saying
that
i
may
wear
it
until
i
have
done
with
of
course
i
knew
that
in
a
few
days
at
longest
he
would
be
done
with
this
world
altogether
and
to
gratify
him
i
cheerfully
drew
and
signed
the
paper
come
old
yankee
i
ve
got
you
this
time
see
if
i
haint
exclaimed
adams
with
a
broad
grin
as
he
took
the
paper
i
smiled
and
said
all
right
my
dear
fellow
the
longer
you
live
the
better
i
shall
like
we
parted
and
he
went
to
neponset
a
small
town
near
boston
where
his
wife
and
daughter
lived
he
took
at
once
to
his
bed
and
never
rose
from
it
again
the
excitement
had
passed
away
and
his
vital
energies
could
accomplish
no
more
the
fifth
day
after
arriving
home
the
physician
told
him
he
could
not
live
until
the
next
morning
he
received
the
announcement
in
perfect
calmness
and
with
the
most
apparent
indifference
then
turning
to
his
wife
with
a
smile
he
requested
her
to
have
him
buried
in
the
new
hunting
suit
for
said
he
barnum
agreed
to
let
me
have
it
until
i
have
done
with
it
and
i
was
determined
to
fix
his
flint
this
time
he
shall
never
see
that
dress
his
wife
assured
him
that
his
request
should
be
complied
with
he
then
sent
for
the
clergyman
and
they
spent
several
hours
in
communing
together
adams
who
rough
and
untutored
had
nevertheless
a
natural
eloquence
and
often
put
his
thoughts
in
good
language
said
to
the
clergyman
that
though
he
had
told
some
pretty
big
stories
about
his
bears
he
had
always
endeavored
to
do
the
straight
thing
between
man
and
man
i
have
attended
preaching
every
day
sundays
and
all
said
he
for
the
last
six
years
sometimes
an
old
grizzly
gave
me
the
sermon
sometimes
it
was
a
panther
often
it
was
the
thunder
and
lightning
the
tempest
or
the
hurricane
on
the
peaks
of
the
sierra
nevada
or
in
the
gorges
of
the
rocky
mountains
but
whatever
preached
to
me
it
always
taught
me
the
majesty
of
the
creator
and
revealed
to
me
the
undying
and
unchanging
love
of
our
kind
father
in
heaven
although
i
am
a
pretty
rough
customer
continued
the
dying
man
i
fancy
my
heart
is
in
about
the
right
place
and
look
with
confidence
for
that
rest
which
i
so
much
need
and
which
i
have
never
enjoyed
upon
he
then
desired
the
clergyman
to
pray
with
him
after
which
he
took
him
by
the
hand
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
bade
him
farewell
in
another
hour
his
spirit
had
taken
its
flight
it
was
said
by
those
present
that
his
face
lighted
into
a
smile
as
the
last
breath
escaped
him
and
that
smile
he
carried
into
his
grave
almost
his
last
words
were
won
t
barnum
open
his
eyes
when
he
finds
i
have
humbugged
him
by
being
buried
in
his
new
hunting
dress
that
dress
was
indeed
the
shroud
in
which
he
was
entombed
and
that
was
the
last
on
earth
of
old
grizzly
after
the
death
of
adams
the
grizzly
bears
and
other
animals
were
added
to
the
collection
in
my
museum
and
i
employed
herr
driesbach
the
celebrated
as
an
exhibitor
some
time
afterwards
the
bears
were
sold
to
a
menagerie
company
but
i
kept
old
neptune
the
for
several
years
sending
him
occasionally
for
exhibition
in
other
cities
as
far
west
as
chicago
this
noble
and
ferocious
animal
was
a
very
great
curiosity
and
attracted
great
attention
he
was
kept
in
a
large
tank
which
was
supplied
with
salt
water
every
day
from
the
fall
river
steamboats
whose
deck
hands
filled
my
barrels
on
every
passage
to
the
illustration
the
prince
in
the
museum
city
with
salt
water
from
the
deepest
part
of
long
island
sound
on
his
tours
through
the
country
the
lived
very
well
in
fresh
water
it
was
at
one
time
my
serious
intention
to
engage
in
an
american
indian
exhibition
on
a
stupendous
scale
i
proposed
to
secure
at
the
far
west
not
less
than
one
hundred
of
the
best
specimens
of
indians
with
their
squaws
and
papooses
their
paint
ponies
dresses
and
weapons
for
a
general
tour
throughout
the
united
states
and
europe
the
plan
comprehended
a
grand
entry
at
every
town
and
city
where
the
indians
were
to
exhibit
the
indians
in
all
the
glory
of
paint
and
feathers
beads
and
bright
blankets
riding
on
their
ponies
followed
by
tame
buffaloes
elks
and
antelopes
then
an
exhibition
on
a
lot
large
enough
to
admit
of
a
display
of
all
the
indian
games
and
dances
their
method
of
hunting
their
style
of
cooking
living
etc
such
an
exhibition
is
perfectly
practicable
now
to
any
one
who
has
the
capital
and
tact
to
undertake
it
and
a
sure
fortune
would
follow
the
enterprise
on
the
of
october
the
prince
of
wales
then
making
a
tour
in
the
united
states
in
company
with
his
suite
visited
the
american
museum
this
was
a
very
great
compliment
since
it
was
the
only
place
of
amusement
the
prince
attended
in
this
country
unfortunately
i
was
in
bridgeport
at
the
time
and
the
museum
was
in
charge
of
my
manager
greenwood
knowing
that
the
name
of
the
american
museum
was
familiar
throughout
europe
i
was
quite
confident
of
a
call
from
the
prince
and
from
regard
to
his
filial
feelings
i
had
a
day
or
two
after
his
arrival
in
new
york
ordered
to
be
removed
to
a
dark
closet
a
frightful
wax
figure
of
his
royal
mother
which
for
nineteen
years
had
excited
the
admiration
of
the
million
and
which
bore
a
placard
with
the
legend
an
exact
likeness
of
her
majesty
queen
victoria
taken
from
greenwood
who
was
an
englishman
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
condescension
of
the
prince
and
backed
his
way
through
the
halls
followed
by
the
prince
the
duke
of
newcastle
and
other
members
of
the
royal
suite
and
he
actually
trembled
as
he
attempted
to
do
the
reception
honors
presently
they
arrived
in
front
of
the
platform
on
which
were
exhibited
the
various
living
human
curiosities
and
monstrosities
the
tall
giant
woman
made
her
best
bow
the
fat
boy
waddled
out
and
kissed
his
hand
the
negro
turning
white
showed
his
ivory
and
his
spots
the
dwarfs
kicked
up
their
heels
and
like
the
clown
in
the
ring
cried
here
we
are
again
the
living
skeleton
stalked
out
reminding
the
prince
perhaps
of
the
wish
of
sidney
smith
in
a
hot
day
that
he
could
lay
off
his
flesh
and
sit
in
his
bones
the
albino
family
went
through
their
performances
the
what
is
it
grinned
the
infant
beat
a
tattoo
and
the
aztec
children
were
shown
and
described
as
specimens
of
a
remarkable
and
ancient
race
in
mexico
and
central
america
the
prince
and
his
suite
seemed
pleased
and
greenwood
was
duly
delighted
he
was
however
quite
overwhelmed
with
the
responsibility
of
his
position
especially
whenever
the
prince
addressed
him
and
leading
the
way
to
the
wax
figure
hall
he
called
attention
to
the
figures
of
the
siamese
twins
and
the
quaker
giant
and
his
wife
i
suppose
said
the
prince
these
figures
are
representatives
of
different
living
curiosities
exhibited
from
time
to
time
in
your
museum
yes
your
royal
highness
all
of
them
replied
the
confused
greenwood
and
as
all
of
them
included
very
fair
figures
of
the
emperors
nicholas
and
napoleon
the
empress
eugenie
and
other
equally
distinguished
personages
the
prince
must
have
thought
that
the
museum
had
contained
in
times
past
some
famous
living
on
leaving
the
museum
the
prince
asked
to
see
barnum
and
when
he
was
told
that
i
was
out
of
town
he
remarked
we
have
missed
the
most
interesting
feature
of
the
a
few
days
afterwards
when
the
prince
was
in
boston
happening
to
be
in
that
city
i
sent
my
card
to
him
at
the
revere
house
and
was
cordially
received
he
smiled
when
i
reminded
him
that
i
had
seen
him
when
he
was
a
little
boy
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
my
visits
to
buckingham
palace
with
general
tom
thumb
the
prince
told
me
that
he
was
much
pleased
with
his
recent
inspection
of
my
museum
and
that
he
and
his
suite
had
left
their
autographs
in
the
establishment
as
mementos
of
their
visit
when
i
arrived
in
boston
by
the
by
on
this
visit
the
streets
were
thronged
with
the
military
and
citizens
assembled
to
receive
the
prince
of
wales
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
starting
from
the
depot
to
the
revere
house
in
getting
through
the
assembled
crowd
at
last
a
policeman
espied
me
and
taking
me
for
senator
stephen
douglas
he
cried
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
make
way
there
for
judge
douglas
s
the
crowd
opened
a
passage
for
my
carriage
at
short
notice
and
shouted
out
douglas
douglas
hurrah
for
i
took
off
my
hat
and
bowed
smiling
from
the
windows
on
each
side
of
my
carriage
the
cheers
and
enthusiasm
increased
as
i
advanced
and
all
the
way
to
the
revere
house
i
continued
to
bow
judge
douglas
s
grateful
acknowledgments
for
the
enthusiastic
reception
there
must
have
been
at
least
fifty
thousand
people
who
joined
in
this
spontaneous
demonstration
in
honor
of
judge
douglas
when
douglas
ran
for
the
presidency
in
my
democratic
friend
johnson
bet
me
a
hat
that
the
judge
would
be
elected
douglas
passed
through
bridgeport
on
his
electioneering
tour
down
east
and
made
a
brief
speech
from
the
rear
platform
of
the
car
to
the
people
assembled
at
the
depot
the
next
day
johnson
met
me
in
a
crowded
barber
shop
and
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
seen
douglas
i
answered
that
i
had
and
johnson
then
asked
what
sort
of
a
looking
man
he
was
remembering
our
hat
bet
and
knowing
that
johnson
expected
a
pretty
hard
description
of
his
favorite
candidate
i
said
he
is
a
dumpy
swaggering
chap
looking
like
a
regular
i
thought
as
much
said
johnson
for
here
is
the
new
haven
paper
of
this
morning
which
says
that
he
is
the
very
image
in
personal
appearance
of
when
the
roar
that
followed
subsided
i
told
johnson
i
must
have
had
some
other
man
in
my
mind
s
eye
when
i
answered
his
question
one
day
i
went
out
of
the
museum
in
great
haste
to
tom
higginson
s
barber
shop
in
the
park
hotel
where
my
daily
tonsorial
operations
were
performed
and
finding
a
hibernian
just
ahead
of
me
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
give
me
his
turn
i
would
pay
his
bill
to
which
he
consented
and
taking
his
turn
and
my
own
shave
i
speedily
departed
saying
to
tom
as
i
went
out
fix
out
this
man
and
for
whatever
he
has
done
i
will
pay
the
two
or
three
clerks
and
reporters
who
were
in
the
shop
and
who
knew
me
put
their
heads
together
and
suggested
to
tom
that
here
was
an
opportunity
to
perpetrate
a
practical
joke
on
barnum
and
they
explained
the
plan
in
which
higginson
readily
acquiesced
now
says
one
of
them
to
the
irishman
get
everything
done
which
you
like
and
it
will
cost
you
nothing
it
will
be
charged
to
the
gentleman
to
whom
you
gave
your
sure
and
a
liberal
gintleman
he
must
be
said
pat
will
you
take
a
bath
asked
the
barber
that
indade
i
will
if
the
gintleman
pays
was
the
reply
when
he
came
out
of
the
bath
he
was
asked
if
he
would
be
shampooed
and
what
is
that
asked
the
bewildered
hibernian
the
process
was
explained
and
he
consented
to
go
through
with
the
operation
thereafter
moved
and
instigated
thereto
by
the
barber
and
his
confederates
pat
permitted
higginson
to
dye
his
red
hair
and
whiskers
a
beautiful
brown
and
then
to
curl
them
when
all
was
done
the
son
of
erin
looked
in
the
mirror
and
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
a
more
thorough
transformation
could
scarcely
be
conceived
and
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
he
said
to
higginson
give
the
generous
gintleman
me
best
complements
and
tell
him
he
can
have
my
turn
ony
day
on
the
same
one
of
the
newspaper
reporters
who
assisted
in
the
joke
published
the
whole
story
the
next
day
and
when
i
called
at
the
barber
shop
a
bill
for
was
presented
which
of
course
i
could
do
no
less
than
to
pay
the
joke
went
the
rounds
of
the
papers
and
after
a
few
months
an
english
friend
sent
me
the
whole
story
in
a
copy
of
the
london
a
publication
that
issues
about
half
a
million
of
copies
weekly
currier
the
lithographer
put
the
joke
into
pictorial
form
representing
the
irishman
as
he
appeared
before
also
as
he
appeared
after
the
operations
after
all
it
was
a
good
advertisement
for
me
as
well
as
for
higginson
and
it
would
have
been
pretty
difficult
to
serve
me
up
about
these
times
in
printers
ink
in
any
form
that
i
should
have
objected
to
meanwhile
the
museum
flourished
better
than
ever
and
i
began
to
make
large
holes
in
the
mortgages
which
covered
the
property
of
my
wife
in
new
york
and
in
connecticut
still
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
debts
resting
upon
all
her
real
estate
and
nothing
but
time
economy
industry
and
diligence
would
remove
the
burdens

rods
west
of
the
grounds
of
iranistan
i
had
originally
a
tract
of
twelve
acres
but
half
of
it
had
been
devoted
to
my
daughter
and
on
the
other
half
i
now
proposed
to
establish
my
own
residence
to
prepare
the
site
it
was
necessary
to
cart
in
several
thousands
of
loads
of
dirt
to
fill
up
the
hollow
and
to
make
the
broad
beautiful
lawn
in
the
centre
of
which
i
erected
the
new
house
and
after
supplying
the
place
with
fountains
shrubbery
statuary
and
all
that
could
adorn
it
i
named
my
new
home
it
was
in
truth
a
very
delightful
place
complete
and
convenient
in
all
respects
and
there
is
scarcely
a
more
beautiful
residence
in
bridgeport
now
meanwhile
my
pet
city
east
bridgeport
was
progressing
with
giant
strides
the
wheeler
and
wilson
sewing
machine
manufactory
had
been
quadrupled
in
size
and
employed
about
a
thousand
workmen
numerous
other
large
factories
had
been
built
and
scores
of
houses
were
erected
besides
many
neat
but
smaller
and
cheaper
houses
for
laborers
and
mechanics
that
piece
of
property
which
but
eight
years
before
had
been
farm
land
with
scarcely
six
houses
upon
the
whole
tract
was
now
a
beautiful
new
city
teeming
with
busy
life
and
looking
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
the
greatest
pleasure
which
i
then
took
or
even
now
take
was
in
driving
through
those
busy
streets
admiring
the
beautiful
houses
and
substantial
factories
with
their
thousands
of
prosperous
workmen
and
reflecting
that
i
had
in
so
great
a
measure
been
the
means
of
adding
all
this
life
bustle
and
wealth
to
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
reflection
on
this
subject
only
confirmed
in
my
mind
the
great
doctrine
of
compensations
how
plain
was
it
in
my
case
that
an
apparent
evil
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
how
palpable
was
it
now
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
clock
failure
this
prosperity
could
not
have
existed
here
an
old
citizen
of
bridgeport
used
to
say
to
me
when
a
few
years
before
he
had
noticed
my
zeal
in
trying
to
build
up
the
east
side
mr
barnum
your
contemplated
new
city
is
like
a
fire
made
with
chestnut
wood
it
burns
so
long
as
you
keep
blowing
it
and
when
you
stop
it
goes
out
i
like
to
laugh
at
him
about
his
chestnut
wood
of
course
i
did
blow
the
fire
in
all
possible
ways
but
the
result
proved
that
the
wood
which
fed
the
fire
was
not
chestnut
but
the
best
and
soundest
old
hickory
the
situation
was
everything
that
could
be
desired
and
i
knew
that
in
order
to
induce
manufacturers
to
establish
their
business
in
the
new
city
a
prime
requisite
was
the
advantage
i
could
offer
to
employers
agents
and
workmen
to
secure
good
and
cheap
homes
in
the
vicinity
of
their
place
of
labor
to
show
the
method
i
adopted
to
secure
this
end
i
copy
from
the
files
of
the
bridgeport
an
offer
which
i
made
and
the
editorial
comment
thereon
this
offer
i
may
add
was
not
so
much
for
the
purpose
of
blowing
the
fire
which
was
already
fairly
roaring
with
a
lively
blaze
as
for
the
sake
of
helping
those
who
were
willing
to
help
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
contribute
to
my
happiness
as
well
as
their
own
by
forwarding
the
growth
of
the
new
city
new
houses
in
east
bridgeport
every
man
to
own
the
house
he
lives
in
there
is
a
demand
at
the
present
moment
for
two
hundred
more
in
east
bridgeport
it
is
evident
that
if
the
money
expended
in
rent
can
be
paid
towards
the
purchase
of
a
house
and
lot
the
person
so
paying
will
in
a
few
years
own
the
house
he
lives
in
instead
of
always
remaining
a
tenant
in
view
of
this
fact
i
propose
to
loan
money
at
six
per
cent
to
any
number
not
exceeding
fifty
industrious
temperate
and
respectable
individuals
who
desire
to
build
their
own
houses
they
may
engage
their
own
builders
and
build
according
to
any
reasonable
plan
which
i
may
approve
or
i
will
have
it
done
for
them
at
the
lowest
possible
rate
without
a
farthing
profit
to
myself
or
agent
i
putting
the
lot
at
a
fair
price
and
advancing
eighty
per
cent
of
the
entire
cost
the
other
party
to
furnish
twenty
per
cent
in
labor
material
or
money
and
they
may
pay
me
in
small
sums
weekly
monthly
or
quarterly
any
amount
not
less
than
three
per
cent
per
quarter
all
of
which
is
to
apply
on
the
money
advanced
until
it
is
paid
it
has
been
ascertained
that
by
purchasing
building
materials
for
cash
and
in
large
quantities
nice
dwellings
painted
and
furnished
with
green
blinds
can
be
erected
at
a
cost
of
or
for
house
lot
fences
all
complete
and
if
six
or
eight
friends
prefer
to
join
in
erecting
a
neat
block
of
houses
with
verandas
in
front
the
average
cost
need
not
exceed
about
per
house
and
lot
if
however
some
parties
would
prefer
a
single
or
double
house
that
would
cost
to
i
shall
be
glad
to
meet
their
views
barnum
february
the
editor
of
the
printed
the
following
upon
my
announcement
an
advantageous
we
have
read
with
great
pleasure
barnum
s
advertisement
offering
assistance
to
any
number
of
persons
not
exceeding
fifty
in
the
erection
of
dwelling
houses
this
plan
combines
all
the
advantages
and
none
of
the
objections
of
building
associations
any
individual
who
can
furnish
in
cash
labor
or
material
only
of
the
amount
requisite
for
the
erection
of
a
dwelling
house
can
receive
the
other
from
barnum
rent
his
house
and
by
merely
paying
what
may
be
considered
as
only
a
fair
rent
for
a
few
years
find
himself
at
last
the
owner
and
all
further
payments
cease
in
the
mean
time
he
can
be
making
such
inexpensive
improvements
in
his
property
as
would
greatly
improve
its
market
value
and
besides
have
the
advantage
of
any
rise
in
the
value
of
real
estate
it
is
not
often
that
such
a
generous
offer
is
made
to
working
men
it
is
a
loan
on
what
would
be
generally
considered
inadequate
security
at
six
per
cent
at
a
time
when
a
much
better
use
of
money
can
be
made
by
any
capitalist
it
is
therefore
generous
barnum
may
make
money
by
the
operation
very
well
perhaps
he
will
but
if
he
does
it
will
be
by
making
others
richer
not
poorer
by
helping
those
who
need
assistance
not
by
hindering
them
and
we
can
only
wish
that
every
rich
man
would
follow
such
a
noble
example
and
thus
without
injury
to
themselves
give
a
helping
hand
to
those
who
need
it
success
to
the
enterprise
we
hope
that
fifty
men
will
be
found
before
the
week
ends
each
of
whom
desires
in
such
a
manner
to
obtain
a
roof
which
he
can
call
his
quite
a
number
of
men
at
once
availed
themselves
of
my
offer
and
eventually
succeeded
in
paying
for
their
homes
without
much
effort
i
am
sorry
to
add
that
rent
is
still
paid
month
after
month
by
many
men
who
would
long
ago
have
owned
neat
homesteads
free
from
all
incumbrances
if
they
had
accepted
my
proposals
and
had
signed
and
kept
the
temperance
pledge
and
given
up
the
use
of
tobacco
the
money
they
have
since
expended
for
whiskey
and
tobacco
would
have
given
them
a
house
of
their
own
if
the
money
had
been
devoted
to
that
object
and
their
positions
socially
and
morally
would
have
been
far
better
than
they
are
how
many
infatuated
men
there
are
in
all
parts
of
the
country
who
could
now
be
independent
and
even
owners
of
their
own
carriages
but
for
their
slavery
to
these
miserable
habits
i
built
a
number
of
houses
to
let
in
order
to
accommodate
those
who
were
unable
to
buy
i
find
this
the
most
unpleasant
part
of
my
connection
with
the
new
city
the
interest
on
the
investment
the
taxes
repairs
wear
and
tear
and
insurance
render
the
most
unprofitable
property
to
own
besides
which
the
landlord
is
often
looked
upon
by
the
tenants
as
an
overbearing
grasping
man
and
one
whose
property
it
is
their
highest
duty
to
injure
as
much
as
possible
for
all
concerned
therefore
it
is
much
better
that
every
person
should
somehow
manage
to
own
the
roof
he
sleeps
under
men
are
more
independent
and
feel
happier
who
live
in
their
own
houses
they
keep
the
premises
in
neater
order
and
they
make
better
citizens
hence
i
always
encourage
poor
people
to
become
householders
if
possible
for
i
find
that
oftentimes
when
they
have
lived
long
in
one
of
my
houses
they
think
it
very
hard
if
the
property
is
not
given
to
them
they
argue
that
the
landlord
is
rich
and
would
never
feel
the
loss
of
one
little
place
not
stopping
to
consider
that
the
aggregate
of
a
great
many
little
places
thus
given
away
would
make
the
landlord
poor
nor
would
the
tenants
be
benefited
so
much
by
homes
that
were
given
to
them
as
they
would
by
homes
that
were
the
fruits
of
their
own
industry
and
economy
the
land
in
east
bridgeport
was
originally
purchased
by
me
at
from
to
and
from
those
sums
to
per
acre
and
the
average
cost
of
all
i
bought
on
that
side
of
the
river
was
per
acre
some
portions
of
this
land
are
now
assessed
in
the
bridgeport
at
from
to
per
acre
at
the
time
i
joined
noble
in
this
enterprise
the
site
we
purchased
was
not
a
part
of
the
city
of
bridgeport
it
is
now
however
a
most
important
section
of
the
city
and
the
three
bridges
connecting
the
two
banks
of
the
river
and
originally
chartered
as
have
been
bought
by
the
city
and
thrown
open
as
free
highways
to
the
public
a
horse
railroad
in
which
i
took
part
of
the
stock
connects
the
two
portions
of
the
city
extending
westerly
beyond
iranistan
and
lindencroft
while
a
branch
road
runs
to
the
beautiful
park
on
the
sound
shore
the
eastern
line
of
east
bridgeport
when
i
first
purchased
so
large
a
portion
of
the
property
was
bounded
by
a
long
narrow
swale
or
valley
of
salt
meadow
through
which
a
small
stream
passed
and
which
was
flooded
with
salt
water
at
every
tide
at
considerable
expense
i
erected
a
dam
at
the
foot
of
this
meadow
and
thus
converted
this
heretofore
filthy
repulsive
and
marsh
into
a
charming
sheet
of
water
which
is
now
known
as
pembroke
lake
if
this
improvement
had
not
been
made
in
all
probability
the
eastern
portion
of
my
property
would
never
have
been
devoted
to
dwelling
houses
as
it
is
barnum
street
has
been
extended
by
means
of
a
bridge
across
the
lake
and
the
eastern
shore
is
already
studded
with
houses
the
land
on
that
side
of
the
lake
lies
in
the
town
of
stratford
and
the
growth
of
the
new
settlement
promises
to
be
as
rapid
as
that
of
east
bridgeport
general
noble
in
laying
out
the
first
portion
of
our
new
city
named
several
streets
after
members
of
his
own
family
and
also
of
mine
hence
we
have
a
noble
street
and
a
noble
street
it
is
a
barnum
street
while
other
streets
are
named
william
from
noble
harriet
the
christian
name
of
noble
hallett
the
maiden
name
of
my
wife
and
caroline
helen
and
pauline
the
names
of
my
three
daughters
there
is
also
the
barnum
school
district
and
so
that
it
seems
as
if
for
a
few
scores
of
years
at
least
posterity
would
know
who
were
the
founders
of
the
new
flourishing
and
beautiful
city
we
have
yet
another
enduring
and
monument
in
the
many
thousands
of
trees
which
we
set
out
and
which
now
line
and
gratefully
shade
the
streets
of
east
bridgeport
figures
can
scarcely
give
an
appreciable
idea
of
the
rapid
growth
and
material
prosperity
of
this
important
portion
of
the
city
of
bridgeport
but
the
city
records
show
that
my
first
purchase
of
land
on
that
side
of
the
river
was
appraised
in
the
bridgeport
assessment
list
in
october
at
while
in
july
the
same
real
estate
with
improvements
less
the
washington
park
the
public
school

in
barnum
district
the
land
for
streets
and
four
church
lots
was
valued
in
the
city
assessment
list
at
when
we
bought
the
property
there
were
but
six
old
farm
houses
on
the
entire
tract
when
the
centre
bridge
was
built
and
opened

on
the
of
october
the
american
museum
was
the
scene
of
another
which
was
in
fact
the
commencement
of
the
fall
dramatic
season
the
summer
months
having
been
devoted
to
pantomime
a
grand
flourish
of
trumpets
in
the
way
of
newspaper
advertisements
and
flaming
posters
drew
a
crowded
house
among
other
attractions
it
was
announced
that
barnum
would
introduce
a
mysterious
novelty
never
before
seen
in
that
establishment
i
appeared
upon
the
stage
behind
a
small
table
in
front
of
which
was
nailed
a
white
sack
on
which
was
inscribed
in
large
letters
the
cat
let
out
of
the
i
then
stated
that
having
spent
two
of
the
summer
months
in
the
country
leaving
the
museum
in
charge
of
greenwood
he
had
purchased
a
curiosity
with
which
he
was
not
satisfied
but
for
my
part
i
thought
he
had
received
his
money
s
worth
and
i
proposed
to
exhibit
it
to
the
audience
for
the
purpose
of
getting
their
opinion
on
the
subject
i
stated
that
a
farmer
came
in
from
the
country
and
said
he
had
got
a
cat
at
home
which
he
would
like
to
sell
that
greenwood
gave
him
a
writing
promising
to
pay
him
dollars
for
such
a
cat
delivered
in
good
health
provided
it
was
not
artificially
colored
and
that
the
cat
was
then
in
the
bag
in
front
of
the
table
ready
for
exhibition
whereupon
my
assistant
drew
from
the
bag
a
common
black
cat
and
i
informed
the
audience
that
when
the
farmer
brought
his
cat
he
quietly
remarked
to
greenwood
that
of
course
he
meant
a
cat
of
the
color
of
black
the
laughter
that
followed
this
narration
was
uproarious
and
the
audience
unanimously
voted
that
the
cat
all
things
considered
was
well
worth
dollars
the
cat
adorned
with
a
collar
bearing
the
inscription
the
cat
was
then
placed
in
the
cage
of
the
happy
family
and
the
story
getting
into
the
newspapers
it
became
another
advertisement
of
the
museum
in
i
learned
that
some
fishermen
at
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
had
succeeded
in
capturing
a
living
white
whale
and
i
was
also
informed
that
a
whale
of
this
kind
if
placed
in
a
box
lined
with
and
partially
filled
with
salt
water
could
be
transported
by
land
to
a
considerable
distance
and
be
kept
alive
it
was
simply
necessary
that
an
attendant
supplied
with
a
barrel
of
salt
water
and
a
sponge
should
keep
the
mouth
and
of
the
whale
constantly
moist
it
seemed
incredible
that
a
living
whale
could
be
expressed
by
railroad
on
a
five
days
journey
and
although
i
knew
nothing
of
the
white
whale
or
its
habits
since
i
had
never
seen
one
i
determined
to
experiment
in
that
direction
landsman
as
i
was
i
believed
that
i
was
quite
as
competent
as
a
lawrence
fisherman
to
superintend
the
capture
and
transportation
of
a
live
white
whale
when
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
attempt
the
task
i
made
every
provision
for
the
expedition
and
took
precaution
against
every
conceivable
contingency
i
determined
upon
the
capture
and
transport
to
my
museum
of
at
least
two
living
whales
and
prepared
in
the
basement
of
the
building
a
brick
and
cement
tank
forty
feet
long
and
eighteen
feet
wide
for
the
reception
of
the
marine
monsters
when
this
was
done
taking
two
trusty
assistants
i
started
upon
my
whaling
expedition
going
by
rail
to
quebec
and
thence
by
the
grand
trunk
railroad
ninety
miles
to
wells
river
where
i
chartered
a
sloop
to
elbow
island
isle
au
coudres
in
the
lawrence
river
and
found
the
place
populated
by
canadian
french
people
of
the
most
ignorant
and
dirty
description
they
were
hospitable
but
frightfully
filthy
and
they
gained
their
livelihood
by
farming
and
fishing
immense
quantities
of
are
made
there
and
in
exploring
about
the
island
we
saw
hundreds
of
buckets
suspended
to
the
trees
to
catch
the
sap
after
numerous
consultations
extending
over
three
whole
days
with
a
party
of
fishermen
whose
gibberish
was
almost
as
untranslatable
as
it
was
unbearable
i
succeeded
in
contracting
for
their
services
to
capture
for
me
alive
and
unharmed
a
couple
of
white
whales
scores
of
which
could
at
all
times
be
discovered
by
their
spouting
within
sight
of
the
island
i
was
to
pay
these
men
a
stipulated
price
per
day
for
their
labor
and
if
they
secured
the
whales
they
were
to
have
a
liberal
bonus
illustration
white
the
plan
decided
upon
was
to
plant
in
the
river
a
kraal
composed
of
stakes
driven
down
in
the
form
of
a
v
leaving
the
broad
end
open
for
the
whales
to
enter
this
was
done
in
a
shallow
place
with
the
point
of
the
kraal
towards
shore
and
if
by
chance
one
or
more
whales
should
enter
the
trap
at
high
water
my
fishermen
were
to
occupy
the
entrance
with
their
boats
and
keep
up
a
tremendous
splashing
and
noise
till
the
tide
receded
when
the
frightened
whales
would
find
themselves
nearly
high
and
dry
or
with
too
little
water
to
enable
them
to
swim
and
their
capture
would
be
the
next
thing
in
order
this
was
to
be
effected
by
securing
a
of
stout
rope
over
their
tails
and
towing
them
to
the
lined
boxes
in
which
they
were
to
be
transported
to
new
york
all
this
was
simple
enough
on
paper
but
several
days
elapsed
before
a
single
spout
was
seen
inside
the
kraal
though
scores
of
whales
were
constantly
around
and
near
it
in
time
it
became
exceedingly
aggravating
to
see
the
whales
glide
so
near
the
trap
without
going
into
it
and
our
patience
was
sorely
tried
one
day
a
whale
actually
went
into
the
kraal
and
the
fishermen
proposed
to
capture
it
but
i
wanted
another
and
while
we
waited
for
number
two
to
go
in
number
one
knowing
the
proverb
probably
and
having
an
eye
to
his
own
interests
went
out
two
days
afterwards
i
was
awakened
at
daylight
by
a
great
noise
and
amid
the
clamor
of
many
voices
i
caught
the
cheering
news
that
two
whales
were
even
then
within
the
kraal
and
hastily
dressing
myself
i
took
a
boat
for
the
exciting
scene
the
real
difficulty
which
was
to
get
the
whales
into
the
trap
was
now
over
and
the
details
of
capture
and
transportation
could
safely
be
left
to
my
trusty
assistants
and
the
fishermen
what
they
were
to
do
until
the
tide
went
out
and
thereafter
was
once
more
fully
explained
and
after
depositing
money
enough
to
pay
the
bill
if
the
capture
was
successful
i
started
at
once
for
quebec
there
i
learned
by
telegraph
that
both
whales
had
been
caught
boxed
and
put
on
board
sloop
for
the
nearest
point
where
they
could
be
transhipped
in
the
cars
i
had
made
every
arrangement
with
the
railway
officials
and
had
engaged
a
special
car
for
the
precious
and
curious
freight
elated
as
i
was
at
the
result
of
this
novel
enterprise
i
had
no
idea
of
hiding
my
light
under
a
bushel
and
i
immediately
wrote
a
full
account
of
the
expedition
its
intention
and
its
success
for
publication
in
the
quebec
and
montreal
newspapers
i
also
prepared
a
large
number
of
brief
notices
which
i
left
at
every
station
on
the
line
instructing
telegraph
operators
to
take
off
all
whaling
messages
that
passed
over
the
wires
to
new
york
and
to
inform
their
fellow
townsmen
at
what
hour
the
whales
would
pass
through
each
place
the
result
of
these
arrangements
may
be
imagined
at
every
station
crowds
of
people
came
to
the
cars
to
see
the
whales
which
were
travelling
by
land
to
barnum
s
museum
and
those
who
did
not
see
the
monsters
with
their
own
eyes
at
least
saw
some
one
who
had
seen
them
and
i
thus
secured
a
tremendous
advertisement
seven
hundred
miles
long
for
the
american
museum
when
i
arrived
in
new
york
a
dozen
despatches
had
come
from
the
whaling
expedition
and
they
continued
to
come
every
few
hours
these
i
bulletined
in
front
of
the
museum
and
sent
copies
to
the
papers
the
excitement
was
intense
and
when
at
last
these
marine
monsters
arrived
and
were
swimming
in
the
tank
that
had
been
prepared
for
them
anxious
thousands
literally
rushed
to
see
the
strangest
curiosities
ever
exhibited
in
new
york
thus
was
my
first
whaling
expedition
a
great
success
but
i
did
not
know
how
to
feed
or
to
take
care
of
the
monsters
and
moreover
they
were
in
fresh
water
and
this
with
the
bad
air
in
the
basement
may
have
hastened
their
death
which
occurred
a
few
days
after
their
arrival
but
not
before
thousands
of
people
had
seen
them
not
at
all
discouraged
i
resolved
to
try
again
my
plan
now
was
to
connect
the
water
of
new
york
bay
with
the
basement
of
the
museum
by
means
of
iron
pipes
under
the
street
and
a
steam
engine
on
the
dock
to
pump
the
water
this
i
actually
did
at
a
cost
of
several
thousand
dollars
with
an
extra
thousand
to
the
aldermanic
ring
for
the
privilege
and
i
constructed
another
tank
in
the
second
floor
of
the
building
this
tank
was
built
of
slate
and
french
glass
plates
six
feet
long
five
feet
broad
and
one
inch
thick
imported
expressly
for
the
purpose
and
the
tank
when
completed
was
feet
square
and
cost
it
was
kept
constantly
supplied
with
what
would
be
called
hibernically
fresh
salt
water
and
inside
of
it
i
soon
had
two
white
whales
caught
as
the
first
had
been
hundreds
of
miles
below
quebec
to
which
city
they
were
carried
by
a
sailing
vessel
and
from
thence
were
brought
by
railway
to
new
york
of
this
whole
enterprise
i
confess
i
was
very
proud
that
i
had
originated
it
and
brought
it
to
such
successful
conclusion
it
was
a
very
great
sensation
and
it
added
thousands
of
dollars
to
my
treasury
the
whales
however
soon
died
their
sudden
and
immense
popularity
was
too
much
for
them
and
i
then
despatched
agents
to
the
coast
of
labrador
and
not
many
weeks
thereafter
i
had
two
more
live
whales
disporting
themselves
in
my
monster
aquarium
certain
envious
people
started
the
report
that
my
whales
were
only
porpoises
but
this
petty
malice
was
turned
to
good
account
for
professor
agassiz
of
harvard
university
came
to
see
them
and
gave
me
a
certificate
that
they
were
genuine
white
whales
and
this
indorsement
i
published
far
and
wide
the
tank
which
i
had
built
in
the
basement
served
for
a
yet
more
interesting
exhibition
on
the
of
august
i
began
to
exhibit
the
first
and
only
genuine
hippopotamus
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
america
and
for
several
weeks
the
museum
was
thronged
by
the
curious
who
came
to
see
the
monster
i
advertised
him
extensively
and
ingeniously
as
the
great
behemoth
of
the
scriptures
giving
a
full
description
of
the
animal
and
his
habits
and
thousands
of
cultivated
people
biblical
students
and
others
were
attracted
to
this
novel
exhibition
there
was
quite
as
much
excitement
in
the
city
over
this
wonder
in
the
animal
creation
as
there
was
in
london
when
the
first
hippopotamus
was
placed
in
the
zoÃ¶logical
collection
in
regent
s
park
having
a
stream
of
salt
water
at
my
command
at
every
high
tide
i
was
enabled
to
make
splendid
additions
to
the
beautiful
aquarium
which
i
was
the
first
to
introduce
into
this
country
i
not
only
procured
living
sharks
porpoises
sea
horses
and
many
rare
fish
from
the
sea
in
the
vicinity
of
new
york
but
in
the
summer
of
i
despatched
a
fishing
smack
and
crew
to
the
island
of
bermuda
and
its
neighborhood
whence
they
brought
scores
of
specimens
of
the
beautiful
angel
fish
and
numerous
other
tropical
fish
of
brilliant
colors
and
unique
forms
these
fish
were
a
great
attraction
to
all
classes
and
especially
to
naturalists
and
others
who
commended
me
for
serving
the
ends
of
science
as
well
as
amusement
but
as
cold
weather
approached
these
tropical
fish
began
to
die
and
before
the
following
spring
they
were
all
gone
i
therefore
replenished
this
portion
of
my
aquaria
during
the
summer
and
for
several
summers
in
succession
by
sending
a
special
vessel
to
the
gulf
for
specimens
these
operations
were
very
expensive
but
i
really
did
not
care
for
the
cost
if
i
could
only
secure
valuable
attractions
in
the
same
year
i
bought
out
the
aquarial
gardens
in
boston
and
soon
after
removed
the
collection
to
the
museum
i
had
now
the
finest
assemblage
of
fresh
as
well
as
salt
water
fish
ever
exhibited
and
with
a
standing
offer
of
one
hundred
dollars
for
every
living
weighing
four
pounds
or
more
which
might
be
brought
to
me
i
soon
had
three
or
four
of
these
beauties
which
from
all
parts
of
the
country
came
to
new
york
to
see
but
the
trout
department
of
my
museum
required
so
much
care
and
was
attended
with
such
constant
risks
that
i
finally
gave
it
up
in
december
i
made
one
of
my
most
palpable
i
was
visited
at
the
museum
by
a
most
remarkable
dwarf
who
was
a
sharp
intelligent
little
fellow
with
a
deal
of
drollery
and
wit
he
had
a
splendid
head
was
perfectly
formed
was
very
attractive
and
in
short
for
a
showman
he
was
a
perfect
treasure
his
name
he
told
me
was
george
washington
morrison
nutt
and
his
father
was
major
rodnia
nutt
a
substantial
farmer
of
manchester
new
hampshire
i
was
not
long
in
despatching
an
efficient
agent
to
manchester
and
in
overcoming
the
competition
with
other
showmen
who
were
equally
eager
to
secure
this
extraordinary
pigmy
the
terms
upon
which
i
engaged
him
for
three
years
were
so
large
that
he
was
christened
the
nutt
i
in
the
mean
time
conferring
upon
him
the
title
of
commodore
as
soon
as
i
engaged
him
placards
posters
and
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
proclaimed
the
presence
of
commodore
nutt
at
the
museum
i
also
procured
for
the
commodore
a
pair
of
shetland
ponies
miniature
coachman
and
footman
in
livery
harness
and
an
elegant
little
carriage
which
when
closed
represented
a
gigantic
english
walnut
the
little
commodore
attracted
great
attention
and
grew
rapidly
in
public
favor
general
tom
thumb
was
then
travelling
in
the
south
and
west
for
some
years
he
had
not
been
exhibited
in
new
york
and
during
these
years
he
had
increased
considerably
in
rotundity
and
had
changed
much
in
his
general
appearance
it
was
a
singular
fact
however
that
commodore
nutt
was
almost
a
of
general
tom
thumb
as
he
looked
years
before
consequently
very
many
of
my
patrons
not
making
allowance
for
the
time
which
had
elapsed
since
they
had
last
seen
the
general
declared
that
i
was
trying
to
play
mrs
gamp
with
my
mrs
harris
that
there
was
in
fact
no
such
person
as
commodore
nutt
and
that
i
was
exhibiting
my
old
friend
tom
thumb
under
a
new
name
the
mistake
was
very
natural
and
to
me
it
was
very
laughable
for
the
more
i
tried
to
convince
people
of
their
error
the
more
they
winked
and
looked
wise
and
said
it
s
pretty
well
done
but
you
can
t
take
me
commodore
nutt
enjoyed
the
joke
very
much
he
would
sometimes
half
admit
the
deception
simply
to
add
to
the
bewilderment
of
the
doubting
portion
of
my
visitors
after
he
had
been
in
the
museum
a
few
weeks
i
took
the
commodore
to
bridgeport
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
by
way
of
relaxation
many
of
the
citizens
of
bridgeport
who
had
known
tom
thumb
from
his
birth
would
salute
the
commodore
as
the
general
tom
thumb
the
little
fellow
would
return
these
salutes
for
he
delighted
in
keeping
up
the
illusion
going
into
a
crowded
one
morning
with
the
little
commodore
we
met
my
friend
gideon
thompson
who
was
sitting
there
and
who
called
out
good
morning
charley
how
are
you
when
did
you
get
home
i
m
quite
well
thank
you
and
i
arrived
last
night
responded
the
commodore
with
due
gravity
i
ve
got
a
horse
now
that
will
beat
yours
said
thompson
he
must
be
pretty
fast
well
charley
i
ll
drive
out
by
your
mother
s
the
first
fine
day
and
give
you
a
all
right
said
little
nutt
but
you
had
better
not
wager
too
much
on
your
fast
horse
for
you
know
mine
is
some
well
uncle
i
exclaimed
you
are
had
this
time
this
little
gentleman
is
not
general
tom
thumb
but
commodore
what
roared
friend
gid
do
you
think
i
am
an
infernal
fool
why
i
knew
charley
stratton
years
before
you
ever
saw
him
didn
t
i
general
no
one
in
the
room
suspected
that
my
little
friend
was
any
other
than
general
tom
thumb
till
william
bassett
the
general
s
came
in
and
remarked
the
wonderful
resemblance
to
our
little
charley
as
he
looked
years
is
not
this
the
general
inquired
half
a
dozen
astonished
men
who
were
speedily
assured
he
was
not
but
was
quite
another
person
this
gave
rise
to
a
proposition
to
exhibit
the
commodore
to
the
general
s
mother
and
a
coach
was
procured
and
bassett
the
commodore
and
i
went
to
stratton
s
house
when
we
arrived
the
commodore
shouted
out
how
are
you
mother
but
the
mother
of
all
persons
in
bridgeport
was
not
to
be
deceived
though
she
expressed
her
astonishment
at
the
very
striking
likeness
the
commodore
bore
to
her
son
as
he
once
looked
bassett
concurred
in
the
testimony
and
said
the
commodore
looked
so
much
like
her
brother
that
she
was
loth
to
let
him
go
it
is
no
wonder
that
other
people
were
deceived
by
the
resemblance
it
was
evident
that
here
was
an
opportunity
to
turn
all
doubts
into
hard
cash
by
simply
bringing
the
two
dwarf
dromios
together
and
showing
them
on
the
same
platform
i
therefore
induced
tom
thumb
to
bring
his
western
engagements
to
a
close
and
to
appear
for
four
weeks
beginning
with
august
in
my
museum
announcements
headed
the
two
dromios
and
two
smallest
men
and
greatest
curiosities
living
as
i
expected
drew
large
crowds
to
see
them
and
many
came
especially
to
solve
their
doubts
with
regard
to
the
genuineness
of
the
but
here
i
was
considerably
nonplussed
for
astonishing
as
it
may
seem
the
doubts
of
many
of
the
visitors
were
confirmed
the
sharp
people
who
were
determined
not
to
be
humbugged
anyhow
still
declared
that
commodore
nutt
was
general
tom
thumb
and
that
the
little
fellow
whom
i
was
trying
to
pass
off
as
tom
thumb
was
no
more
like
the
general
than
he
was
like
the
man
in
the
moon
it
is
very
amusing
to
see
how
people
will
sometimes
deceive
themselves
by
being
too
incredulous
as
an
illustration
the
australian
golden
pigeons
which
deceived
old
adams
were
the
occasion
of
another
ludicrous
incident
a
shrewd
lady
one
of
my
neighbors
in
connecticut
was
visiting
the
museum
and
after
inspecting
the
golden
angel
fish
swimming
in
one
of
the
aquaria
she
abruptly
addressed
me
you
can
t
humbug
me
barnum
that
fish
is
painted
nonsense
said
i
with
a
laugh
the
thing
is
i
don
t
care
i
know
it
is
painted
it
is
as
plain
as
can
but
my
dear
paint
would
not
adhere
to
a
fish
in
the
water
and
if
it
would
it
would
kill
she
left
the
museum
not
more
than
half
convinced
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
i
met
her
in
the
california
menagerie
she
knew
i
was
part
proprietor
in
the
establishment
and
seeing
me
in
conversation
with
old
adams
she
came
to
me
her
eyes
glistening
with
excitement
and
exclaimed
oh
barnum
i
never
saw
anything
so
beautiful
as
those
elegant
golden
pigeons
you
must
give
me
some
of
their
eggs
for
my
own
pigeons
to
hatch
i
should
prize
them
beyond
oh
you
don
t
want
golden
pigeons
i
said
they
are
no
they
are
not
painted
said
she
with
a
laugh
but
i
half
think
the
angel
fish
i
could
scarcely
control
my
laughter
as
i
explained
now
i
never
spoil
a
good
joke
even
when
the
exposure
betrays
a
museum
secret
i
assure
you
upon
honor
that
the
australian
golden
pigeons
as
they
are
labelled
are
really
painted
i
bought
them
for
the
sole
purpose
of
giving
old
adams
a
lesson
in
their
natural
state
they
are
nothing
more
than
common
white
she
was
convinced
and
to
this
day
she
blushes
whenever
any
allusion
is
made
to
the
angel
fish
or
the
golden
in
i
sent
the
commodore
to
washington
and
joining
him
there
i
received
an
invitation
from
president
lincoln
to
call
at
the
white
house
with
my
little
friend
arriving
at
the
appointed
hour
i
was
informed
that
the
president
was
in
a
special
cabinet
meeting
but
that
he
had
left
word
if
i
called
to
be
shown
in
to
him
with
the
commodore
these
were
dark
days
in
the
rebellion
and
i
felt
that
my
visit
if
not
must
at
all
events
be
brief
when
we
were
admitted
lincoln
received
us
cordially
and
introduced
us
to
the
members
of
the
cabinet
when
chase
was
introduced
as
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
little
commodore
remarked
i
suppose
you
are
the
gentleman
who
is
spending
so
much
of
uncle
sam
s
money
no
indeed
said
secretary
of
war
stanton
very
promptly
i
am
spending
the
well
said
commodore
nutt
it
is
in
a
good
cause
anyhow
and
i
guess
it
will
come
out
all
his
apt
remark
created
much
amusement
lincoln
then
bent
down
his
long
lank
body
and
taking
nutt
by
the
hand
he
said
commodore
permit
me
to
give
you
a
parting
word
of
advice
when
you
are
in
command
of
your
fleet
if
you
find
yourself
in
danger
of
being
taken
prisoner
i
advise
you
to
wade
the
commodore
found
the
laugh
was
against
him
but
placing
himself
at
the
side
of
the
president
and
gradually
raising
his
eyes
up
the
whole
length
of
lincoln
s
very
long
legs
he
replied
i
guess
president
you
could
do
that
better
than
i
commodore
nutt
and
the
nova
scotia
giantess
anna
swan
illustrate
the
old
proverb
sufficiently
to
show
how
extremes
occasionally
met
in
my
museum
he
was
the
shortest
of
men
and
she
was
the
tallest
of
women
i
first
heard
of
her
through
a
quaker
who
came
into
my
office
one
day
and
told
me
of
a
wonderful
girl
seventeen
years
of
age
who
resided
near
him
at
pictou
nova
scotia
and
who
was
probably
the
tallest
girl
in
the
world
i
asked
him
to
obtain
her
exact
height
on
his
return
home
which
he
did
and
sent
it
to
me
and
i
at
once
sent
an
agent
who
in
due
time
came
back
with
anna
swan
she
was
an
intelligent
and
by
no
means
girl
and
during
the
long
period
while
she
was
in
my
employ
she
was
visited
by
thousands
of
persons
after
the
burning
of
my
second
museum
she
went
to
england
where
she
attracted
great
attention
for
many
years
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
engaging
parties
of
american
indians
from
the
far
west
to
exhibit
at
the
museum
and
had
sent
two
or
more
indian
companies
to
europe
where
they
were
regarded
as
very
great
in
ten
or
twelve
chiefs
of
as
many
different
tribes
visited
the
president
of
the
united
states
at
washington
by
a
pretty
liberal
outlay
of
money
i
succeeded
in
inducing
the
interpreter
to
bring
them
to
new
york
and
to
pass
some
days
at
my
museum
of
course
getting
these
indians
to
dance
or
to
give
any
illustration
of
their
games
or
pastimes
was
out
of
the
question
they
were
real
chiefs
of
powerful
tribes
and
would
no
more
have
consented
to
give
an
exhibition
of
themselves
than
the
chief
magistrate
of
our
own
nation
would
have
done
their
interpreter
could
not
therefore
promise
that
they
would
remain
at
the
museum
for
any
definite
time
for
said
he
you
can
only
keep
them
just
so
long
as
they
suppose
all
your
patrons
come
to
pay
them
visits
of
honor
if
they
suspected
that
your
museum
was
a
place
where
people
paid
for
entering
he
continued
you
could
not
keep
them
a
moment
after
the
on
their
arrival
at
the
museum
therefore
i
took
them
upon
the
stage
and
personally
introduced
them
to
the
public
the
indians
liked
this
attention
from
me
as
they
had
been
informed
that
i
was
the
proprietor
of
the
great
establishment
in
which
they
were
invited
and
honored
guests
my
patrons
were
of
course
pleased
to
see
these
old
chiefs
as
they
knew
they
were
the
thing
and
several
of
them
were
known
to
the
public
either
as
being
friendly
or
cruel
to
the
whites
after
one
or
two
appearances
upon
the
stage
i
took
them
in
carriages
and
visited
the
mayor
of
new
york
in
the
governor
s
room
at
the
city
hall
here
the
mayor
made
them
a
speech
of
welcome
which
being
interpreted
to
the
savages
was
responded
to
by
a
speech
from
one
of
the
chiefs
in
which
he
thanked
the
great
father
of
the
city
for
his
pleasant
words
and
for
his
kindness
in
pointing
out
the
portraits
of
his
predecessors
hanging
on
the
walls
of
the
governor
s
room
on
another
occasion
i
took
them
by
special
invitation
to
visit
one
of
the
large
public
schools
up
town
the
teachers
were
pleased
to
see
them
and
arranged
an
exhibition
of
special
exercises
by
the
scholars
which
they
thought
would
be
most
likely
to
gratify
their
barbaric
visitors
at
the
close
of
these
exercises
one
old
chief
arose
and
simply
said
this
is
all
new
to
us
we
are
mere
unlearned
sons
of
the
forest
and
can
not
understand
what
we
have
seen
and
on
other
occasions
i
took
them
to
ride
in
central
park
and
through
different
portions
of
the
city
at
every
street
corner
which
we
passed
they
would
express
their
astonishment
to
each
other
at
seeing
the
long
rows
of
houses
which
extended
both
ways
on
either
side
of
each
of
course
between
each
of
these
outside
visits
i
would
return
with
them
to
the
museum
and
secure
two
or
three
appearances
upon
the
stage
to
receive
the
people
who
had
there
congregated
to
do
them
as
they
regarded
me
as
their
host
they
did
not
hesitate
to
trespass
upon
my
hospitality
whenever
their
eyes
rested
upon
a
glittering
shell
among
my
specimens
of
conchology
especially
if
it
had
several
brilliant
colors
one
would
take
off
his
coat
another
his
shirt
and
insist
that
i
should
exchange
my
shell
for
their
garment
when
i
declined
the
exchange
but
on
the
contrary
presented
them
with
the
coveted
article
i
soon
found
i
had
established
a
dangerous
precedent
immediately
they
all
commenced
to
beg
for
everything
in
my
vast
collection
which
they
happened
to
take
a
liking
to
this
cost
me
many
valuable
specimens
and
often
put
me
to
my
trumps
for
an
excuse
to
avoid
giving
them
things
which
i
could
not
part
with
the
chief
of
one
of
the
tribes
one
day
discovered
an
ancient
shirt
of
which
hung
in
one
of
my
cases
of
antique
armor
he
was
delighted
with
it
and
declared
he
must
have
it
i
tried
all
sorts
of
excuses
to
prevent
his
getting
it
for
it
had
cost
me
a
hundred
dollars
and
was
a
great
curiosity
but
the
old
man
s
eyes
glistened
and
he
would
not
take
no
for
an
answer
the
utes
have
killed
my
little
child
he
told
me
through
the
interpreter
and
now
he
must
have
this
steel
shirt
to
protect
himself
and
when
he
returned
to
the
rocky
mountains
he
would
have
his
revenge
i
remained
inexorable
until
he
finally
brought
me
a
new
buckskin
indian
suit
which
he
insisted
upon
exchanging
i
felt
compelled
to
accept
his
proposal
and
never
did
i
see
a
man
more
delighted
than
he
seemed
to
be
when
he
took
the
mailed
shirt
into
his
hands
he
fairly
jumped
up
and
down
with
joy
he
ran
to
his
lodging
room
and
soon
appeared
again
with
the
coveted
armor
upon
his
body
and
marched
down
one
of
the
main
halls
of
the
museum
with
folded
arms
and
head
erect
occasionally
patting
his
breast
with
his
right
hand
as
much
as
to
say
now
ute
look
sharp
for
i
will
soon
be
on
the
war
path
among
these
indians
were
war
bonnet
lean
bear
and
chiefs
of
the
cheyennes
yellow
buffalo
of
the
kiowas
yellow
bear
of
the
same
tribe
jacob
of
the
caddos
and
white
bull
of
the
apaches
the
little
wiry
chief
known
as
yellow
bear
had
killed
many
whites
as
they
had
travelled
through
the
far
he
was
a
sly
treacherous
savage
who
would
think
no
more
of
scalping
a
family
of
women
and
children
than
a
butcher
would
of
wringing
the
neck
of
a
chicken
but
now
he
was
on
a
mission
to
the
great
father
at
washington
seeking
for
presents
and
favors
for
his
tribe
and
he
pretended
to
be
exceedingly
meek
and
humble
and
continually
urged
the
interpreter
to
announce
him
as
a
great
friend
to
the
white
he
would
fawn
about
me
and
although
not
speaking
or
understanding
a
word
of
our
language
would
try
to
convince
me
that
he
loved
me
dearly
in
exhibiting
these
indian
warriors
on
the
stage
i
explained
to
the
large
audiences
the
names
and
characteristics
of
each
when
i
came
to
yellow
bear
i
would
pat
him
familiarly
upon
the
shoulder
which
always
caused
him
to
look
up
to
me
with
a
pleasant
smile
while
he
softly
stroked
down
my
arm
with
his
right
hand
in
the
most
loving
manner
knowing
that
he
could
not
understand
a
word
i
said
i
pretended
to
be
complimenting
him
to
the
audience
while
i
was
really
saying
something
like
the
following
this
little
indian
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
yellow
bear
chief
of
the
kiowas
he
has
killed
no
doubt
scores
of
white
persons
and
he
is
probably
the
meanest
rascal
that
lives
in
the
far
here
i
patted
him
on
the
head
and
he
supposing
i
was
sounding
his
praises
would
smile
fawn
upon
me
and
stroke
my
arm
while
i
continued
if
the
little
villain
understood
what
i
was
saying
he
would
kill
me
in
a
moment
but
as
he
thinks
i
am
complimenting
him
i
can
safely
state
the
truth
to
you
that
he
is
a
lying
thieving
treacherous
murderous
monster
he
has
tortured
to
death
poor
unprotected
women
murdered
their
husbands
brained
their
helpless
little
ones
and
he
would
gladly
do
the
same
to
you
or
to
me
if
he
thought
he
could
escape
punishment
this
is
but
a
faint
description
of
the
character
of
yellow
here
i
gave
him
another
patronizing
pat
on
the
head
and
he
with
a
pleasant
smile
bowed
to
the
audience
as
much
as
to
say
that
my
words
were
quite
true
and
that
he
thanked
me
very
much
for
the
high
encomiums
i
had
so
generously
heaped
upon
him
after
they
had
been
about
a
week
at
the
museum
one
of
the
chiefs
discovered
that
visitors
paid
money
for
entering
this
information
he
soon
communicated
to
the
other
chiefs
and
i
heard
an
immediate
murmur
of
discontent
their
eyes
were
opened
and
no
power
could
induce
them
to
appear
again
upon
the
stage
their
dignity
had
been
offended
and
their
wild
flashing
eyes
were
anything
but
agreeable
indeed
i
hardly
felt
safe
in
their
presence
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
i
witnessed
their
departure
for
washington
the
next
morning
in
the
spring
of
the
united
states
consul
at
larnica
island
of
cyprus
turkish
dominions
wrote
me
a
letter
declaring
that
he
and
the
english
consul
an
american
physician
resident
in
the
island
and
a
large
company
of
europeans
as
well
as
natives
had
seen
the
most
remarkable
object
no
doubt
in
the
world
a
a
feminine
phenomenon
this
woman
was
represented
to
have
four
cornicles
on
her
head
and
one
large
horn
equal
in
size
to
an
ordinary
ram
s
horn
growing
out
of
the
side
of
her
head
and
the
consistency
of
the
horns
was
represented
to
be
similar
to
that
of
cows
or
goats
horns
this
singular
story
continued
these
horns
have
been
growing
for
ten
or
twelve
years
and
were
carefully
concealed
by
the
woman
until
a
few
weeks
since
when
a
vision
appeared
in
the
person
of
an
old
man
and
warned
her
to
remove
the
veil
she
wore
or
god
would
punish
her
she
sent
to
the
greek
priest
she
being
of
that
persuasion
and
confessed
to
him
and
was
ordered
to
uncover
her
head
which
she
at
once
she
was
subsequently
seen
by
the
entire
population
and
the
french
consul
in
company
with
others
offered
her
fifty
thousand
piastres
to
go
to
paris
for
exhibition
the
english
consul
i
was
further
informed
had
pronounced
this
woman
to
be
worth
her
weight
in
gold
and
i
was
assured
that
if
i
wished
to
add
her
to
my
wonderful
museum
and
present
to
the
american
public
the
most
remarkable
object
yet
exhibited
i
had
only
to
send
an
agent
immediately
to
secure
the
informing
myself
of
the
trustworthiness
of
my
correspondent
who
also
wrote
a
similar
account
to
the
new
york
i
was
not
long
in
making
up
my
mind
to
secure
this
freak
of
nature
and
i
despatched
john
greenwood
in
the
steamer
city
of
baltimore
for
liverpool
april
he
went
to
london
and
paris
and
thence
to
marseilles
where
he
took
a
syrian
and
egyptian
steamer
to
palermo
and
from
thence
proceeded
to
cyprus
on
arriving
if
he
could
have
seen
the
woman
at
once
he
could
have
on
the
steamer
which
sailed
again
in
a
few
hours
for
other
islands
but
unfortunately
the
woman
was
a
few
miles
in
the
interior
and
poor
greenwood
was
detained
a
month
on
the
island
before
he
could
take
another
steamer
to
get
away
worse
yet
the
woman
spite
of
the
impression
she
had
made
upon
so
many
and
such
respectable
witnesses
was
really
no
curiosity
after
all
as
it
proved
upon
examination
that
her
horns
were
not
horns
at
all
but
fleshy
excrescences
which
may
have
been
singularly
shaped
tumors
or
wens
it
is
needless
to
add
that
my
agent
did
not
engage
her
and
after
a
month
of
discomfort
and
hard
living
he
succeeded
in
getting
away
and
sailed
for
constantinople
mainly
to
see
what
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
securing
one
or
more
circassian
women
for
exhibition
in
my
museum
on
his
way
through
the
mediterranean
he
had
the
following
adventure
on
board
the
steamer
the
harem
of
a
turkish
pasha
occupied
one
side
of
the
quarter
deck
which
was
divided
off
from
the
rest
by
a
hurdle
fence
run
longitudinally
through
the
middle
of
the
deck
greenwood
was
one
day
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
his
back
to
these
women
and
their
attendants
when
feeling
his
chair
move
he
turned
and
saw
one
of
the
pasha
s
wives
getting
over
the
hurdle
and
as
there
was
scarcely
room
for
her
to
squeeze
herself
between
the
chairs
in
which
passengers
were
sitting
he
moved
his
own
chair
out
of
the
way
and
rising
offered
his
hand
to
assist
the
woman
over
the
fence
she
indignantly
jumped
back
and
greenwood
was
immediately
seized
by
two
of
the
pasha
s
attendants
violently
shaken
and
taken
to
task
in
turkish
for
daring
to
offer
to
touch
the
hand
of
one
of
his
excellency
s
women
greenwood
had
that
day
formed
the
acquaintance
of
a
a
young
greek
from
scio
who
was
going
to
beyrout
to
act
as
clerk
for
a
merchant
in
that
place
he
spoke
good
english
and
seeing
greenwood
in
trouble
among
the
turks
and
knowing
that
he
could
speak
neither
greek
nor
arabic
he
went
to
the
rescue
and
demanded
an
explanation
of
the
difficulty
upon
hearing
what
was
the
trouble
he
informed
the
illustration
in
a
turkish
turbulent
fellows
that
greenwood
had
no
motive
in
his
act
beyond
simple
common
courtesy
the
prisoner
however
was
still
detained
in
the
grasp
of
the
turks
till
the
will
of
the
insulted
pasha
could
be
known
on
deck
soon
came
the
irate
pasha
in
company
with
an
old
gentleman
who
was
said
to
have
been
tutor
formerly
to
the
present
sultan
of
turkey
when
the
two
heard
the
charge
and
the
explanation
and
had
consulted
together
a
little
while
greenwood
was
released
but
for
the
friendly
interposition
of
the
greek
he
might
have
been
bastinadoed
or
even
bowstrung
during
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
he
was
closely
watched
but
he
was
very
careful
to
be
guilty
of
no
act
of
politeness
and
he
went
on
shore
at
constantinople
without
so
much
as
saying
to
the
pasha
in
constantinople
he
had
some
very
singular
adventures
to
carry
out
his
purpose
of
getting
access
to
the
very
interior
of
the
he
dressed
himself
in
full
turkish
costume
learned
a
few
words
and
phrases
which
would
be
necessary
in
his
assumed
character
as
a
and
as
the
turks
are
a
notably
reticent
people
he
succeeded
very
well
in
passing
himself
off
for
what
he
appeared
though
he
ran
a
risk
of
detection
many
times
every
day
in
this
manner
he
saw
a
large
number
of
circassian
girls
and
women
some
of
them
the
most
beautiful
beings
he
had
ever
seen
and
after
a
month
in
constantinople
and
in
other
turkish
cities
he
sailed
for
marseilles
then
went
to
paris
picking
up
many
treasures
for
my
museum
and
returned
to
new
york

in
i
heard
of
an
extraordinary
dwarf
girl
named
lavinia
warren
who
was
residing
with
her
parents
at
middleboro
massachusetts
and
i
sent
an
invitation
to
her
and
her
parents
to
come
and
visit
me
at
bridgeport
they
came
and
i
found
her
to
be
a
most
intelligent
and
refined
young
lady
well
educated
and
an
accomplished
beautiful
and
woman
in
miniature
i
succeeded
in
making
an
engagement
with
her
for
several
years
during
which
she
contracted
as
dwarfs
are
said
to
have
the
power
to
do
to
visit
great
britain
france
and
other
foreign
lands
having
arranged
the
terms
of
her
engagement
i
took
her
to
the
house
of
one
of
my
daughters
in
new
york
where
she
remained
quietly
while
i
was
procuring
her
wardrobe
and
jewelry
and
making
arrangements
for
her
dÃ©but
as
yet
nothing
had
been
said
in
the
papers
about
this
interesting
young
lady
and
one
day
as
i
was
taking
her
home
with
me
to
bridgeport
i
met
in
the
cars
the
wife
of
a
wealthy
menagerie
proprietor
who
introduced
me
to
her
two
daughters
young
ladies
of
sixteen
and
eighteen
years
of
age
and
then
said
you
have
disguised
the
little
commodore
very
that
is
not
commodore
nutt
i
replied
it
is
a
young
lady
whom
i
have
recently
very
well
done
barnum
replied
with
a
look
of
self
satisfaction
really
i
repeated
this
a
young
thank
you
barnum
but
i
know
commodore
nutt
in
whatever
costume
you
put
him
and
i
recognized
him
the
moment
you
brought
him
into
the
but
i
replied
commodore
nutt
is
now
exhibiting
in
the
museum
and
this
is
a
little
lady
whom
i
hope
to
bring
before
the
public
mr
barnum
she
replied
you
forget
that
i
am
a
showman
s
wife
conversant
with
all
the
showman
s
tricks
and
that
i
can
not
be
seeing
there
was
no
prospect
of
convincing
her
i
replied
in
a
confidential
whisper
for
such
chance
for
a
joke
was
not
to
be
lost
well
i
see
you
are
too
sharp
for
me
but
i
beg
you
not
to
mention
it
for
you
are
the
only
person
on
board
this
train
who
suspects
it
is
the
i
will
say
nothing
she
replied
but
do
please
bring
the
little
fellow
over
here
for
my
daughters
have
never
seen
i
stepped
and
told
lavinia
the
joke
and
asked
her
to
help
carry
it
out
i
then
took
her
over
where
she
got
a
seat
in
the
midst
of
the
three
ladies
ah
commodore
whispered
you
have
done
it
pretty
well
but
bless
you
i
knew
those
eyes
and
that
nose
the
moment
i
saw
your
eyes
must
be
pretty
sharp
then
replied
lavinia
oh
you
see
people
in
our
line
understand
these
things
and
are
never
deceived
by
appearances
but
let
me
introduce
you
to
these
two
young
ladies
my
we
are
happy
to
see
you
sir
said
one
of
the
young
ladies
they
then
enjoyed
a
very
animated
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
they
asked
the
commodore
all
about
his
family
and
lavinia
managed
to
answer
the
questions
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
suspicion
the
ladies
then
informed
the
commodore
that
there
was
a
sweet
little
lady
living
in
their
town
only
sixteen
years
old
and
if
he
would
visit
them
they
would
introduce
him
that
her
family
was
highly
respectable
and
she
would
make
him
a
capital
wife
lavinia
thanked
them
and
promised
to
visit
them
if
it
should
be
convenient
as
the
ladies
left
the
car
they
shook
hands
with
lavinia
kissed
her
and
in
a
whisper
said
good
morning
meeting
the
husband
of
the
lady
some
weeks
afterwards
i
told
him
the
joke
and
he
enjoyed
it
so
highly
that
he
will
probably
never
let
his
wife
and
daughters
hear
the
last
of
it
i
purchased
a
very
splendid
wardrobe
for
miss
warren
including
scores
of
the
richest
dresses
that
could
be
procured
costly
jewels
and
in
fact
everything
that
could
add
to
the
charms
of
her
naturally
charming
little
person
she
was
then
placed
on
exhibition
at
the
museum
and
from
the
day
of
her
she
was
an
extraordinary
success
commodore
nutt
was
on
exhibition
with
her
and
although
he
was
several
years
her
junior
he
evidently
took
a
great
fancy
to
her
one
day
i
presented
to
lavinia
a
diamond
and
emerald
ring
and
as
it
did
not
exactly
fit
her
finger
i
told
her
i
would
give
her
another
one
and
that
she
might
present
this
one
to
the
commodore
in
her
own
name
she
did
so
and
an
effect
was
speedily
apparent
the
little
commodore
felt
sure
that
this
was
a
and
poor
lavinia
was
in
the
greatest
trouble
for
she
considered
herself
quite
a
woman
and
regarded
the
commodore
only
as
a
nice
little
boy
but
she
did
not
like
to
offend
him
and
while
she
did
not
encourage
she
did
not
openly
repel
his
attentions
miss
lavinia
warren
however
was
never
destined
to
be
commodore
nutt
it
was
by
no
means
an
unnatural
circumstance
that
i
should
be
suspected
of
having
instigated
and
brought
about
the
marriage
of
tom
thumb
with
lavinia
warren
had
i
done
this
i
should
at
this
day
have
felt
no
regrets
for
it
has
proved
in
an
eminent
degree
one
of
the
happy
i
only
say
what
is
known
to
all
of
their
immediate
friends
that
from
first
to
last
their
engagement
was
an
affair
of
the
heart
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
that
the
attachment
was
mutual
and
that
it
only
grows
with
the
lapse
of
time
but
i
had
neither
part
nor
lot
in
instigating
or
in
occasioning
the
marriage
and
as
i
am
anxious
to
be
put
right
before
the
public
and
so
to
correct
whatever
of
false
impression
may
have
gained
ground
i
have
procured
the
consent
of
all
the
parties
to
a
sketch
of
the
wooing
winning
and
nuptials
of
course
i
should
not
lay
these
details
before
the
public
except
with
the
sanction
of
those
most
interested
in
this
they
consent
to
pay
the
penalty
of
distinction
and
if
the
wooings
of
kings
and
queens
must
be
told
why
not
the
courtship
and
marriage
of
general
and
tom
thumb
the
story
is
an
interesting
one
and
shall
be
told
alike
to
exonerate
me
from
the
suspicion
named
and
to
amuse
those
and
they
count
by
scores
of
thousands
who
are
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
distinguished
couple
in
the
autumn
of
when
lavinia
warren
was
on
exhibition
at
the
museum
tom
thumb
had
no
business
engagement
with
me
in
fact
he
was
not
on
exhibition
at
the
time
at
all
he
was
taking
a
vacation
at
his
house
in
bridgeport
whenever
he
came
to
new
york
he
naturally
called
upon
me
his
old
friend
at
the
museum
he
happened
to
be
in
the
city
at
the
time
referred
to
and
one
day
he
called
quite
unexpectedly
to
me
while
lavinia
was
holding
one
of
her
levees
here
he
now
saw
her
for
the
first
time
and
very
naturally
made
her
acquaintance
he
had
a
short
interview
with
her
after
which
he
came
directly
to
my
private
office
and
desired
to
see
me
alone
of
course
i
complied
with
his
request
but
without
the
remotest
suspicion
as
to
his
object
i
closed
the
door
and
the
general
took
a
seat
his
first
question
let
in
the
light
he
inquired
about
the
family
of
lavinia
warren
i
gave
him
the
facts
which
i
clearly
perceived
gave
him
satisfaction
of
a
peculiar
sort
he
then
said
with
great
frankness
and
with
no
less
earnestness
mr
barnum
that
is
the
most
charming
little
lady
i
ever
saw
and
i
believe
she
was
created
on
purpose
to
be
my
wife
now
he
continued
you
have
always
been
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
want
you
to
say
a
good
word
for
me
to
her
i
have
got
plenty
of
money
and
i
want
to
marry
and
settle
down
in
life
and
i
really
feel
as
if
i
must
marry
that
young
the
little
general
was
highly
excited
and
his
general
manner
betrayed
the
usual
anxiety
which
i
doubt
not
most
of
my
readers
will
understand
without
a
description
i
could
not
repress
a
smile
nor
forget
my
joke
and
i
said
lavinia
is
engaged
to
whom
commodore
nutt
asked
tom
thumb
with
much
earnestness
and
some
exhibition
of
the
no
general
to
me
i
replied
never
mind
said
the
general
laughing
you
can
exhibit
her
for
a
while
and
then
give
up
the
engagement
but
i
do
hope
you
will
favor
my
suit
with
i
told
the
general
that
this
was
too
sudden
an
affair
that
he
must
take
time
to
think
of
it
but
he
insisted
that
years
of
thought
would
make
no
difference
for
his
mind
was
fully
made
up
well
general
i
replied
i
will
not
oppose
you
in
your
suit
but
you
must
do
your
own
courting
i
tell
you
however
the
commodore
will
be
jealous
of
you
and
more
than
that
miss
warren
is
nobody
s
fool
and
you
will
have
to
proceed
very
cautiously
if
you
can
succeed
in
winning
her
the
general
thanked
me
and
promised
to
be
very
discreet
a
change
now
came
suddenly
over
him
in
several
particulars
he
had
been
much
to
his
credit
very
fond
of
his
country
home
in
bridgeport
where
he
spent
his
intervals
of
rest
with
his
horses
and
especially
with
his
yacht
for
his
fondness
for
the
water
was
his
great
passion
but
now
he
was
constantly
having
occasion
to
visit
the
city
and
horses
and
yachts
were
strangely
neglected
he
had
a
married
sister
in
new
york
and
his
visits
to
her
multiplied
for
of
course
he
came
to
new
york
to
see
his
sister
his
mother
who
resided
in
bridgeport
remarked
that
charles
had
never
before
shown
so
much
brotherly
affection
nor
so
much
fondness
for
city
life
his
visits
to
the
museum
were
very
frequent
and
it
was
noticeable
that
new
relations
were
being
established
between
him
and
commodore
nutt
the
commodore
was
not
exactly
jealous
yet
he
strutted
around
like
a
bantam
rooster
whenever
the
general
approached
lavinia
one
day
he
and
the
general
got
into
a
friendly
scuffle
in
the
and
the
commodore
threw
the
general
upon
his
back
in
double
quick
time
the
commodore
is
lithe
wiry
and
quick
in
his
movements
but
the
general
is
naturally
slow
and
although
he
was
considerably
heavier
than
the
commodore
he
soon
found
that
he
could
not
stand
before
him
in
a
personal
encounter
moreover
the
commodore
is
naturally
and
when
excited
he
brags
about
his
knowledge
of
the
manly
art
of
and
sometimes
talks
about
pistols
and
bowie
knives
etc
tom
thumb
on
the
contrary
is
by
natural
disposition
decidedly
a
man
of
peace
hence
in
this
agreeing
with
falstaff
as
to
what
constituted
the
better
part
of
valor
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
keep
his
distance
if
the
little
commodore
showed
any
belligerent
symptoms
in
the
course
of
several
weeks
the
general
found
numerous
opportunities
to
talk
with
lavinia
while
the
commodore
was
performing
on
the
stage
or
was
otherwise
engaged
and
to
a
watchful
discerner
it
was
evident
he
was
making
encouraging
progress
in
the
affair
of
the
heart
he
also
managed
to
meet
lavinia
on
sunday
afternoons
and
evenings
without
the
knowledge
of
the
commodore
but
he
assured
me
he
had
not
yet
dared
to
suggest
matrimony
he
finally
returned
to
bridgeport
and
privately
begged
that
on
the
following
saturday
i
would
take
lavinia
up
to
my
house
and
also
invite
him
his
immediate
object
in
this
was
that
his
mother
might
get
acquainted
with
lavinia
for
he
feared
opposition
from
that
source
whenever
the
idea
of
his
marriage
should
be
suggested
i
could
do
no
less
than
accede
to
his
proposal
and
on
the
following
friday
while
lavinia
and
the
commodore
were
sitting
in
the
i
said
lavinia
you
may
go
up
to
bridgeport
with
me
morning
and
remain
until
thank
you
she
replied
it
will
be
quite
a
relief
to
get
into
the
country
for
a
couple
of
the
commodore
immediately
pricked
up
his
ears
and
said
mr
barnum
should
like
to
go
to
bridgeport
what
for
i
asked
i
want
to
see
my
little
ponies
i
have
not
seen
them
for
several
months
he
replied
i
whispered
in
his
ear
you
little
rogue
is
the
pony
you
want
to
see
pointing
to
lavinia
he
insisted
i
was
mistaken
when
i
remarked
that
he
could
not
well
be
spared
from
the
museum
he
said
oh
i
can
perform
at
half
past
seven
o
clock
and
then
jump
on
to
the
eight
o
clock
evening
train
and
go
up
by
myself
reaching
bridgeport
before
eleven
and
return
early
monday
i
feared
there
would
be
a
clashing
of
interests
between
the
rival
pigmies
but
wishing
to
please
him
i
consented
to
his
request
especially
as
lavinia
also
favored
it
i
wished
i
could
then
fathom
that
little
woman
s
heart
and
see
whether
she
who
must
have
discovered
the
secret
of
the
general
s
frequent
visits
to
the
museum
desired
the
commodore
s
visit
in
order
to
stir
up
the
general
s
ardor
or
whether
as
seemed
to
me
the
more
likely
she
was
seeking
in
this
way
to
prevent
a
which
she
was
not
inclined
to
favor
certain
it
is
that
though
i
was
the
general
s
confidant
and
knew
all
his
desires
upon
the
subject
no
person
had
discovered
the
slightest
evidence
that
lavinia
warren
had
ever
entertained
the
remotest
suspicion
of
his
thoughts
regarding
marriage
if
she
had
made
the
discovery
as
i
assume
she
kept
the
secret
well
in
fact
i
assured
tom
thumb
that
every
indication
so
far
as
any
of
us
could
observe
was
to
the
effect
that
his
suit
would
be
rejected
the
little
general
was
fidgety
but
determined
hence
he
was
anxious
to
have
lavinia
meet
his
mother
and
also
see
his
possessions
in
bridgeport
for
he
owned
considerable
land
and
numerous
houses
there
the
general
met
us
at
the
depot
in
bridgeport
on
saturday
morning
and
drove
us
to
my
house
in
his
own
carriage
his
coachman
being
tidily
dressed
with
a
broad
velvet
ribbon
and
silver
buckle
placed
upon
his
hat
expressly
for
the
occasion
lavinia
was
duly
informed
that
this
was
the
general
s
turn
out
and
after
resting
half
an
hour
at
lindencroft
he
took
her
out
to
ride
he
stopped
a
few
moments
at
his
mother
s
house
where
she
saw
the
apartments
which
his
father
had
built
expressly
for
him
and
filled
with
the
most
gorgeous
furniture
all
corresponding
to
his
own
diminutive
size
then
he
took
her
to
east
bridgeport
and
undoubtedly
took
occasion
to
point
out
in
great
detail
all
of
the
houses
which
he
owned
for
he
depended
much
upon
having
his
wealth
make
some
impression
upon
her
they
returned
and
the
general
stayed
to
lunch
i
asked
lavinia
how
she
liked
her
ride
she
replied
it
was
very
pleasant
but
she
added
it
seems
as
if
you
and
tom
thumb
owned
about
all
of
bridgeport
the
general
took
his
leave
and
returned
at
five
o
clock
to
dinner
with
his
mother
stratton
remained
until
seven
o
clock
she
expressed
herself
charmed
with
lavinia
warren
but
not
a
suspicion
passed
her
mind
that
little
charlie
was
endeavoring
to
give
her
this
accomplished
young
lady
as
a
the
general
had
privately
asked
me
to
invite
him
to
stay
over
night
for
said
he
if
i
get
a
chance
i
intend
to
pop
the
question
before
the
commodore
so
i
told
his
mother
i
thought
the
general
had
better
stop
with
us
over
night
as
the
commodore
would
be
up
in
the
late
train
adding
that
it
would
be
more
pleasant
for
the
little
folks
to
be
together
she
assented
and
the
general
was
happy
after
tea
lavinia
and
the
general
sat
down
to
play
backgammon
as
nine
o
clock
approached
i
remarked
that
it
was
about
time
to
retire
but
somebody
would
have
to
sit
up
until
nearly
eleven
o
clock
in
order
to
let
in
the
commodore
the
general
replied
i
will
sit
up
with
pleasure
if
miss
warren
will
remain
lavinia
carelessly
replied
that
she
was
accustomed
to
late
hours
and
she
would
wait
and
see
the
commodore
a
little
supper
was
placed
upon
the
table
for
the
commodore
and
the
family
retired
now
it
happened
that
a
couple
of
mischievous
young
ladies
were
visiting
at
my
house
one
of
whom
was
to
sleep
with
lavinia
they
were
suspicious
that
the
general
was
going
to
propose
to
lavinia
that
evening
and
in
a
spirit
of
ungovernable
curiosity
they
determined
notwithstanding
its
manifest
impropriety
to
witness
the
operation
if
they
could
possibly
manage
to
do
so
on
the
sly
of
course
this
was
inexcusable
the
more
so
as
so
few
of
my
readers
had
they
been
placed
under
the
same
temptation
would
have
been
guilty
of
such
an
impropriety
perhaps
i
should
hesitate
to
use
the
testimony
of
such
witnesses
or
even
to
trust
it
but
a
few
weeks
after
they
told
the
little
couple
the
whole
story
were
forgiven
and
all
had
a
hearty
laugh
over
it
it
so
happened
that
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
in
which
the
general
and
lavinia
were
left
at
the
backgammon
board
opened
into
the
hall
just
at
the
side
of
the
stairs
and
these
young
misses
turning
out
the
lights
in
the
hall
seated
themselves
upon
the
stairs
in
the
dark
where
they
had
a
full
view
of
the
cosy
little
couple
and
were
within
easy
of
all
that
was
said
the
house
was
still
the
general
soon
acknowledged
himself
vanquished
at
backgammon
and
gave
it
up
after
sitting
a
few
moments
he
evidently
thought
it
was
best
to
put
a
clincher
on
the
financial
part
of
his
abilities
so
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
policy
of
insurance
and
handing
it
to
lavinia
he
asked
her
if
she
knew
what
it
was
examining
it
she
replied
it
is
an
insurance
policy
i
see
you
keep
your
property
but
the
beauty
of
it
is
it
is
not
my
property
replied
the
general
and
yet
i
get
the
benefit
of
the
insurance
in
case
of
fire
you
will
see
he
continued
unfolding
the
policy
this
is
the
property
of
williams
but
here
you
will
observe
it
reads
loss
if
any
payable
to
charles
stratton
as
his
interest
may
the
fact
is
i
loaned
williams
three
thousand
dollars
took
a
mortgage
on
his
house
and
made
him
insure
it
for
my
benefit
in
this
way
you
perceive
i
get
my
interest
and
he
has
to
pay
the
that
is
a
very
wise
way
i
should
think
remarked
lavinia
that
is
the
way
i
do
all
my
business
replied
the
general
complacently
as
he
returned
the
huge
insurance
policy
to
his
pocket
you
see
he
continued
i
never
lend
any
of
my
money
without
taking
bond
and
mortgage
security
then
i
have
no
trouble
with
taxes
my
principal
is
secure
and
i
receive
my
interest
the
explanation
seemed
satisfactory
to
lavinia
and
the
general
s
courage
began
to
rise
drawing
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
hers
he
said
so
you
are
going
to
europe
soon
yes
replied
lavinia
mr
barnum
intends
to
take
me
over
in
a
couple
of
you
will
find
it
very
pleasant
remarked
the
general
i
have
been
there
twice
in
fact
i
have
spent
six
years
abroad
and
i
like
the
old
countries
very
i
hope
i
shall
like
the
trip
and
i
expect
i
shall
responded
lavinia
for
barnum
says
i
shall
visit
all
the
principal
cities
and
he
has
no
doubt
i
will
be
invited
to
appear
before
the
queen
of
england
the
emperor
and
empress
of
france
the
king
of
prussia
the
emperor
of
austria
and
at
the
courts
of
any
other
countries
which
we
may
visit
oh
i
shall
like
that
it
will
be
so
new
to
yes
it
will
be
very
interesting
indeed
i
have
visited
most
of
the
crowned
heads
remarked
the
general
with
an
evident
feeling
of
but
are
you
not
afraid
you
will
be
lonesome
in
a
strange
country
asked
the
general
no
i
think
there
is
no
danger
of
that
for
friends
will
accompany
me
was
the
reply
i
wish
i
was
going
over
for
i
know
all
about
the
different
countries
and
could
explain
them
all
to
you
remarked
tom
thumb
that
would
be
very
nice
said
lavinia
do
you
think
so
said
the
general
moving
his
chair
still
closer
to
lavinia
s
of
course
replied
lavinia
coolly
for
i
being
a
stranger
to
all
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
people
as
well
as
to
the
country
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
some
person
along
who
could
answer
all
my
foolish
i
should
like
it
first
rate
if
barnum
would
engage
me
said
the
general
i
thought
you
remarked
the
other
day
that
you
had
money
enough
and
was
tired
of
travelling
said
lavinia
with
a
slightly
mischievous
look
from
one
corner
of
her
eye
that
depends
upon
my
company
while
travelling
replied
the
general
you
might
not
find
my
company
very
i
would
be
glad
to
risk
well
perhaps
barnum
would
engage
you
if
you
asked
him
said
lavinia
would
you
really
like
to
have
me
go
asked
the
general
quietly
insinuating
his
arm
around
her
waist
but
hardly
close
enough
to
touch
her
of
course
i
would
was
the
reply
the
little
general
s
arm
clasped
the
waist
closer
as
he
turned
his
face
nearer
to
hers
and
said
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
pleasanter
if
we
went
as
man
and
wife
the
little
fairy
quickly
disengaged
his
arm
and
remarked
that
the
general
was
a
funny
fellow
to
joke
in
that
way
i
am
not
joking
at
all
said
the
general
earnestly
it
is
quite
too
serious
a
matter
for
i
wonder
why
the
commodore
don
t
come
said
lavinia
i
hope
you
are
not
anxious
for
his
arrival
for
i
am
sure
am
not
responded
the
general
and
what
is
more
i
do
hope
you
will
say
yes
before
he
comes
at
all
really
stratton
said
lavinia
with
dignity
if
you
are
in
earnest
in
your
strange
proposal
i
must
say
i
am
well
i
hope
you
are
not
replied
the
general
for
i
was
never
more
in
earnest
in
my
life
and
i
hope
you
will
consent
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
i
felt
that
you
were
created
to
be
my
but
this
is
so
not
so
very
sudden
it
is
several
months
since
we
first
met
and
you
know
all
about
me
and
my
family
and
i
hope
you
find
nothing
to
object
to
in
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
have
found
you
very
agreeable
in
fact
i
like
you
very
much
as
a
friend
but
i
have
not
thought
of
marrying
and
and
what
my
dear
said
the
general
giving
her
a
kiss
now
i
beg
of
you
don
t
have
any
buts
or
ands
about
it
you
say
you
like
me
as
a
friend
why
will
you
not
like
me
as
a
husband
you
ought
to
get
married
i
love
you
dearly
and
i
want
you
for
a
wife
now
deary
the
commodore
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
i
may
not
have
a
chance
to
see
you
again
alone
do
say
that
we
will
be
married
and
i
will
get
barnum
to
give
up
your
lavinia
hesitated
and
finally
said
i
think
i
love
you
well
enough
to
consent
but
i
have
always
said
i
would
never
marry
without
my
mother
s
oh
i
ll
ask
your
mother
may
i
ask
your
mother
come
say
yes
to
that
and
i
will
go
and
see
her
next
week
may
i
do
that
pet
then
there
was
a
sound
of
something
very
much
like
the
popping
of
several
corks
from
as
many
beer
bottles
the
young
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
character
of
these
reports
nor
did
they
doubt
that
they
sealed
the
betrothal
for
immediately
after
they
heard
lavinia
say
yes
charles
you
may
ask
my
another
volley
of
reports
followed
and
then
lavinia
said
now
charles
don
t
whisper
this
to
a
living
soul
let
us
keep
our
own
secrets
for
the
all
right
said
the
general
i
will
say
nothing
but
next
tuesday
i
shall
start
to
see
your
perhaps
you
may
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
her
consent
said
lavinia
at
that
moment
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
and
immediately
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
little
commodore
entered
here
general
said
the
commodore
as
he
espied
his
rival
yes
said
lavinia
mr
barnum
asked
him
to
stay
and
we
were
waiting
for
you
come
warm
i
am
not
cold
said
the
commodore
where
is
barnum
he
has
gone
to
bed
remarked
the
general
but
a
nice
supper
has
been
prepared
for
i
am
not
hungry
i
thank
you
i
am
going
to
bed
which
room
does
barnum
sleep
in
said
the
little
bantam
in
a
petulant
tone
of
voice
his
question
was
answered
the
young
scampered
to
their
sleeping
apartments
and
the
commodore
soon
came
to
my
room
where
he
found
me
indulging
in
the
foolish
habit
of
reading
in
bed
mr
barnum
does
tom
thumb
board
here
asked
the
commodore
sarcastically
no
said
i
tom
thumb
does
not
here
i
invited
him
to
stop
over
night
so
don
t
be
foolish
but
go
to
oh
it
s
no
affair
of
mine
i
don
t
care
anything
about
it
but
i
thought
he
had
taken
up
his
board
here
replied
the
commodore
and
off
he
went
to
bed
evidently
in
a
bad
humor
ten
minutes
afterwards
tom
thumb
came
rushing
into
my
room
and
closing
the
door
he
caught
hold
of
my
hand
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
and
whispered
we
are
engaged
barnum
we
are
engaged
we
are
engaged
and
he
jumped
up
and
down
in
the
greatest
glee
is
that
possible
i
asked
yes
sir
indeed
it
is
but
you
must
not
mention
it
he
responded
we
agreed
to
tell
nobody
so
please
don
t
say
a
word
i
must
tell
of
course
but
mum
is
the
i
am
going
tuesday
to
get
her
mother
s
i
promised
secrecy
and
the
general
retired
in
as
happy
a
mood
as
i
ever
saw
him
lavinia
also
retired
but
not
a
hint
did
she
give
to
the
young
lady
with
whom
she
slept
regarding
the
engagement
indeed
our
family
plied
her
upon
the
subject
the
next
day
but
not
a
breath
passed
her
lips
that
would
give
the
slightest
indication
of
what
had
transpired
she
was
quite
sociable
with
the
commodore
and
as
the
general
concluded
to
go
home
the
next
morning
the
commodore
s
equanimity
and
good
feelings
were
fully
restored
the
general
made
a
call
of
half
an
hour
sunday
evening
and
managed
to
have
an
interview
with
lavinia
the
next
morning
she
and
the
commodore
returned
to
new
york
in
good
spirits
i
remaining
in
bridgeport
the
general
called
on
me
monday
however
bringing
a
very
nice
letter
which
he
had
written
to
lavinia
s
mother
he
had
concluded
to
send
this
letter
by
his
trusty
friend
george
a
wells
instead
of
going
himself
and
he
had
just
seen
wells
who
had
consented
to
go
to
middleborough
with
the
letter
the
following
day
and
to
urge
the
general
s
suit
if
it
should
be
necessary
the
general
went
to
new
york
on
wednesday
and
was
there
to
await
wells
arrival
on
wednesday
morning
the
general
and
lavinia
walked
into
my
office
and
after
closing
the
door
the
little
general
said
mr
barnum
i
want
somebody
to
tell
the
commodore
that
lavinia
and
i
are
engaged
for
i
am
afraid
there
will
be
a
row
when
he
hears
of
do
it
yourself
general
i
replied
oh
said
the
general
almost
shuddering
i
would
not
dare
to
do
it
he
might
knock
me
i
will
do
it
said
lavinia
and
it
was
at
once
arranged
that
i
should
call
the
commodore
and
lavinia
into
my
office
and
either
she
or
myself
would
tell
him
the
general
of
course
when
the
commodore
joined
us
and
the
door
was
closed
i
said
commodore
do
you
know
what
this
little
witch
has
been
doing
no
i
don
t
he
answered
well
she
has
been
cutting
up
one
of
the
greatest
pranks
you
ever
heard
of
i
replied
she
almost
deserves
to
be
shut
up
for
daring
to
do
it
can
t
you
guess
what
she
has
done
he
mused
a
moment
and
then
looking
at
me
said
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
serious
looking
face
engaged
yes
said
i
absolutely
engaged
to
be
married
to
general
tom
thumb
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
is
that
so
lavinia
asked
the
commodore
looking
her
earnestly
in
the
face
that
is
so
said
lavinia
and
wells
has
gone
to
obtain
my
mother
s
the
commodore
turned
pale
and
choked
a
little
as
if
he
was
trying
to
swallow
something
then
turning
on
his
heel
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
i
hope
you
may
be
as
he
passed
out
of
the
door
a
tear
rolled
down
his
cheek
that
is
pretty
hard
i
said
to
lavinia
i
am
very
sorry
she
replied
but
i
could
not
help
it
that
diamond
and
emerald
ring
which
you
bade
me
present
in
my
name
has
caused
all
this
half
an
hour
after
this
incident
the
commodore
came
to
my
office
and
said
mr
barnum
do
you
think
it
would
be
right
for
miss
warren
to
marry
charley
stratton
if
her
mother
should
object
i
saw
that
the
little
fellow
had
still
a
slight
hope
to
hang
on
and
i
said
no
indeed
it
would
not
be
well
she
says
she
shall
marry
him
any
way
that
she
gives
her
mother
the
chance
to
consent
but
if
she
objects
she
will
have
her
own
way
and
marry
him
said
the
commodore
on
the
contrary
i
replied
i
will
not
permit
it
she
is
engaged
to
go
to
europe
for
me
and
i
will
not
release
her
if
her
mother
does
not
fully
consent
to
her
marrying
tom
the
commodore
s
eyes
glistened
with
pleasure
as
he
replied
between
you
and
me
barnum
i
don
t
believe
she
will
give
her
but
the
next
day
dissipated
his
hopes
wells
returned
saying
that
lavinia
s
mother
at
first
objected
for
she
feared
it
was
a
contrivance
to
get
them
married
for
the
promotion
of
some
pecuniary
advantage
but
upon
reading
the
letter
from
the
general
and
one
still
more
urgent
from
lavinia
and
also
upon
hearing
from
wells
that
in
case
of
their
marriage
i
should
cancel
all
claims
i
had
upon
lavinia
s
services
she
consented
after
the
commodore
had
heard
the
news
i
said
to
him
never
mind
commodore
minnie
warren
is
a
better
match
for
you
she
is
a
charming
little
creature
and
two
years
younger
than
you
while
lavinia
is
several
years
your
i
thank
you
sir
replied
the
commodore
pompously
i
would
not
marry
the
best
woman
living
i
don
t
believe
in
women
any
i
then
suggested
that
he
should
stand
with
little
minnie
as
groom
and
bridesmaid
at
the
approaching
wedding
no
sir
replied
the
commodore
emphatically
i
won
t
do
it
that
idea
was
therefore
abandoned
a
few
weeks
subsequently
when
time
had
reconciled
the
commodore
he
told
me
that
tom
thumb
had
asked
him
to
stand
as
groom
with
minnie
at
the
wedding
and
he
was
going
to
do
so
when
i
asked
you
a
few
weeks
ago
you
refused
i
said
it
was
not
your
business
to
ask
me
replied
the
commodore
pompously
when
the
proper
person
invited
me
i
of
course
the
approaching
wedding
was
announced
it
created
an
immense
excitement
lavinia
s
levees
at
the
museum
were
crowded
to
suffocation
and
her
photographic
pictures
were
in
great
demand
for
several
weeks
she
sold
more
than
three
hundred
dollars
worth
of
her
de
each
day
and
the
daily
receipts
at
the
museum
were
frequently
over
three
thousand
dollars
i
engaged
the
general
to
exhibit
and
to
assist
her
in
the
sale
of
pictures
to
which
his
own
photograph
of
course
was
added
i
could
afford
to
give
them
a
fine
wedding
and
i
did
so
the
little
couple
made
a
personal
application
to
bishop
potter
to
perform
the
nuptial
ceremony
and
obtained
his
consent
but
the
matter
became
public
and
outside
pressure
from
some
of
the
most
squeamish
of
his
clergy
was
brought
to
bear
upon
the
bishop
and
he
rescinded
his
engagement
this
fact
of
itself
as
well
as
the
opposition
that
caused
it
only
added
to
the
notoriety
of
the
approaching
wedding
and
increased
the
crowds
at
the
museum
the
financial
result
to
me
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
which
i
was
of
course
quite
willing
to
accept
though
in
this
instance
the
advertisement
so
far
as
the
fact
of
the
betrothal
of
the
parties
with
its
preliminaries
were
concerned
was
not
of
my
seeking
as
the
recital
now
given
shows
but
seeing
the
turn
it
was
taking
in
crowding
the
museum
and
pouring
money
into
the
treasury
i
did
not
hesitate
to
seek
continued
advantage
from
the
notoriety
of
the
prospective
marriage
accordingly
i
offered
the
general
and
lavinia
fifteen
thousand
dollars
if
they
would
postpone
the
wedding
for
a
month
and
continue
their
exhibitions
at
the
museum
not
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
said
the
general
excitedly
good
for
you
charley
said
lavinia
only
you
ought
to
have
said
not
for
a
for
i
would
not
they
both
laughed
heartily
at
what
they
considered
my
discomfiture
and
such
looked
at
from
a
business
point
of
view
it
certainly
was
the
wedding
day
approached
and
the
public
excitement
grew
for
several
days
i
might
say
weeks
the
approaching
marriage
of
tom
thumb
was
the
new
york
for
proof
of
this
i
did
not
need
what
however
was
illustration
in
ample
the
newspaper
paragraphs
a
surer
index
was
in
the
crowds
that
passed
into
the
museum
and
the
dollars
that
found
their
way
into
the
ticket
office
it
was
suggested
to
me
that
a
small
fortune
in
itself
could
be
easily
made
out
of
the
excitement
let
the
ceremony
take
place
in
the
academy
of
music
charge
a
big
price
for
admission
and
the
citizens
will
come
in
i
have
no
manner
of
doubt
that
in
this
way
thousand
dollars
could
easily
have
been
obtained
but
i
had
no
such
thought
i
had
promised
to
give
the
couple
a
genteel
and
graceful
wedding
and
i
kept
my
word
the
day
arrived
tuesday
february
the
ceremony
was
to
take
place
in
grace
church
new
york
the
rev
junius
willey
rector
of
john
s
church
in
bridgeport
assisted
by
the
late
rev
taylor
of
grace
church
was
to
officiate
the
organ
was
played
by
morgan
i
know
not
what
better
i
could
have
done
had
the
wedding
of
a
prince
been
in
contemplation
the
church
was
comfortably
filled
by
a
highly
select
audience
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
none
being
admitted
except
those
having
cards
of
invitation
among
them
were
governors
of
several
of
the
states
to
whom
i
had
sent
cards
and
such
of
those
as
could
not
be
present
in
person
were
represented
by
friends
to
whom
they
had
given
their
cards
members
of
congress
were
present
also
generals
of
the
army
and
many
other
prominent
public
men
numerous
applications
were
made
from
wealthy
and
distinguished
persons
for
tickets
to
witness
the
ceremony
and
as
high
as
sixty
dollars
was
offered
for
a
single
admission
but
not
a
ticket
was
sold
and
tom
thumb
and
lavinia
warren
were
pronounced
man
and
wife
before
witnesses
the
following
entirely
authentic
correspondence
the
only
suppression
being
the
name
of
the
person
who
wrote
to
taylor
and
to
whom
taylor
s
reply
is
addressed
shows
how
a
certain
witness
was
not
a
witness
of
the
famous
wedding
in
other
particulars
the
correspondence
speaks
for
itself
to
the
rev
dr
the
object
of
my
unwillingly
addressing
you
this
note
is
to
inquire
what
right
you
had
to
exclude
myself
and
other
owners
of
pews
in
grace
church
from
entering
it
yesterday
enforced
too
by
a
cordon
of
police
for
that
purpose
if
my
pew
is
not
my
property
i
wish
to
know
it
and
if
it
is
i
deny
your
right
to
prevent
me
from
occupying
it
whenever
the
church
is
open
even
at
a
marriage
of
mountebanks
which
i
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
cross
the
street
to
witness
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
broadway
new
york
i
am
sorry
my
valued
friend
that
you
should
have
written
me
the
peppery
letter
that
is
now
before
me
if
the
matter
of
which
you
complain
be
so
utterly
insignificant
and
contemptible
as
a
marriage
of
mountebanks
which
you
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
cross
the
street
to
witness
it
surprises
me
that
you
should
have
made
such
strenuous
but
efforts
to
secure
a
ticket
of
admission
and
why
permit
me
to
ask
in
the
name
of
reason
and
philosophy
do
you
still
suffer
it
to
disturb
you
so
sadly
it
would
perhaps
be
a
sufficient
answer
to
your
letter
to
say
that
your
cause
of
complaint
exists
only
in
your
imagination
you
have
never
been
excluded
from
your
pew
as
rector
i
am
the
only
custodian
of
the
church
and
you
will
hardly
venture
to
say
that
you
have
ever
applied
to
me
for
permission
to
enter
and
been
refused
here
i
might
safely
rest
and
leave
you
to
the
comfort
of
your
own
reflections
in
the
case
but
as
you
in
common
with
many
other
worthy
persons
would
seem
to
have
very
crude
notions
as
to
your
rights
of
property
in
pews
you
will
pardon
me
for
saying
that
a
pew
in
a
church
is
property
only
in
a
peculiar
and
restricted
sense
it
is
not
property
as
your
house
or
your
horse
is
property
it
vests
you
with
no
fee
in
the
soil
you
can
not
use
it
in
any
way
and
in
every
way
and
at
all
times
as
your
pleasure
or
caprice
may
dictate
you
can
not
put
it
to
any
common
or
unhallowed
uses
you
can
not
remove
it
nor
injure
it
nor
destroy
it
in
short
you
hold
by
purchase
and
may
sell
the
right
to
the
undisturbed
possession
of
that
little
space
within
the
church
edifice
which
you
call
your
pew
during
the
hours
of
divine
service
but
even
that
right
must
be
exercised
decorously
and
with
a
decent
regard
for
time
and
place
or
else
you
may
at
any
moment
be
ignominiously
ejected
from
it
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
add
that
by
the
law
of
custom
you
may
during
those
said
hours
of
divine
service
but
at
no
other
time
sleep
in
your
pew
you
must
however
do
so
noiselessly
and
never
to
the
disturbance
of
your
sleeping
neighbors
your
property
in
your
pew
has
this
extent
and
nothing
more
now
if
were
at
any
time
to
come
to
me
and
say
sir
i
would
that
you
should
grant
me
the
use
of
grace
church
for
a
solemn
service
a
marriage
a
baptism
or
a
funeral
as
the
case
may
be
and
as
it
is
desirable
that
the
feelings
of
the
parties
should
be
protected
as
far
as
possible
from
the
impertinent
intrusion
and
disturbance
of
a
crowd
from
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
city
i
beg
that
no
one
may
be
admitted
within
the
doors
of
the
church
during
the
very
few
moments
that
we
expect
to
be
there
but
our
invited
friends
only
it
would
certainly
in
such
a
case
be
my
pleasure
to
comply
with
your
request
and
to
meet
your
wishes
in
every
particular
and
i
think
that
even
will
agree
that
all
this
would
be
entirely
reasonable
and
proper
then
tell
me
how
would
such
a
case
differ
from
the
instance
of
which
you
complain
two
young
persons
whose
only
crimes
would
seem
to
be
that
they
are
neither
so
big
nor
so
stupid
nor
so
nor
so
inordinately
selfish
as
some
other
people
come
to
me
and
say
sir
we
are
about
to
be
married
and
we
wish
to
throw
around
our
marriage
all
the
solemnities
of
religion
we
are
strangers
in
your
city
and
as
there
is
no
clergymen
here
standing
in
a
pastoral
relation
to
us
we
have
ventured
to
ask
the
favor
of
the
bishop
of
new
york
to
marry
us
and
he
has
kindly
consented
to
do
so
may
we
then
venture
a
little
further
and
request
the
use
of
your
church
in
which
the
bishop
may
perform
the
marriage
service
we
assure
you
sir
that
we
are
no
shams
no
cheats
no
mountebanks
we
are
neither
monsters
nor
abortions
it
is
true
we
are
little
but
we
are
as
god
made
us
perfect
in
our
littleness
sir
we
are
simply
man
and
woman
of
like
passions
and
infirmities
with
you
and
other
mortals
the
arrangements
for
our
marriage
are
controlled
by
no
showman
and
we
are
sincerely
desirous
that
everything
should
be
ordered
with
a
most
scrupulous
regard
to
decorum
we
hope
to
invite
our
relations
and
intimate
friends
together
with
such
persons
as
may
in
other
years
have
extended
civilities
to
either
of
us
but
we
pledge
ourselves
to
you
most
sacredly
that
no
invitation
can
be
bought
with
money
permit
us
to
say
further
that
as
we
would
most
gladly
escape
from
the
insulting
jeers
and
ribald
sneers
and
coarse
ridicule
of
the
unthinking
multitude
without
we
pray
you
to
allow
us
at
our
own
proper
charges
so
to
guard
the
avenues
of
access
from
the
street
as
to
prevent
all
unseemly
tumult
and
disorder
i
tell
you
sir
that
whenever
and
from
whomsoever
such
an
appeal
is
made
to
my
christian
courtesy
although
it
should
come
from
the
very
humblest
of
the
earth
i
would
go
calmly
and
cheerfully
forward
to
meet
their
wishes
although
as
many
s
as
would
reach
from
here
to
kamtschatka
clothed
in
furs
and
frowns
should
rise
up
to
oppose
me
in
conclusion
i
will
say
that
if
the
marriage
of
charles
stratton
and
lavinia
warren
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
pageant
then
it
was
the
most
beautiful
pageant
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
witness
if
on
the
contrary
it
is
rather
to
be
thought
of
as
a
solemn
ceremony
then
it
was
as
touchingly
solemn
as
a
wedding
can
possibly
be
rendered
it
is
true
the
bishop
was
not
present
but
stratton
s
own
pastor
the
rev
willey
of
bridgeport
connecticut
read
the
service
with
admirable
taste
and
impressiveness
and
the
bride
was
given
away
by
her
mother
s
pastor
and
her
own
next
friend
a
venerable
congregational
clergyman
from
massachusetts
surely
there
never
was
a
gathering
of
so
many
hundreds
of
our
best
people
when
everybody
appeared
so
delighted
with
everything
surely
it
is
no
light
thing
to
call
forth
so
much
innocent
joy
in
so
few
moments
of
passing
time
surely
it
is
no
light
thing
thus
to
smooth
the
roughness
and
sweeten
the
acerbities
which
mar
our
happiness
as
we
advance
upon
the
wearing
journey
of
life
sir
it
was
most
emphatically
a
high
triumph
of
christian
civilization
respectfully
submitted
by
your
obedient
servant
thomas
house
taylor
several
thousand
persons
attended
the
reception
of
and
tom
thumb
the
same
day
at
the
metropolitan
hotel
after
this
they
started
on
a
wedding
tour
taking
washington
in
their
way
they
visited
president
lincoln
at
the
white
house
after
a
couple
of
weeks
they
returned
and
as
they
then
supposed
retired
to
private
life
habit
however
is
indeed
second
nature
the
general
and
his
wife
had
been
accustomed
to
excitement
and
after
a
few
months
retirement
they
again
longed
for
the
peculiar
pleasures
of
a
public
life
and
the
public
were
eager
to
welcome
them
once
more
they
resumed
their
public
career
and
have
since
travelled
several
years
in
europe
and
considerably
in
this
country
holding
public
exhibitions
more
than
half
the
time
and
spending
the
residue
in
leisurely
viewing
such
cities
and
portions
of
the
country
as
they
may
happen
to
be
in
commodore
nutt
and
minnie
warren
i
should
add
usually
travel
with
them
i
met
the
little
commodore
last
summer
after
his
absence
in
europe
of
three
years
and
said
are
you
not
married
yet
commodore
no
sir
my
fruit
is
plucked
he
replied
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
will
never
marry
i
remarked
no
not
exactly
replied
the
commodore
complacently
but
i
have
concluded
not
to
marry
until
i
am
i
suppose
you
intend
to
marry
one
of
your
size
i
said
i
am
not
particular
in
that
respect
but
seeing
my
jocose
mood
he
continued
with
a
comical
leer
i
think
i
should
prefer
marrying
a
good
green
country
girl
to
anybody
this
was
said
with
a
degree
of
nonchalance
which
none
can
appreciate
who
do
not
know
him
to
make
sure
that
a
lack
of
memory
has
not
misled
me
as
to
any
of
the
facts
in
regard
to
the
courtship
and
wedding
of
tom
thumb
and
lavinia
warren
i
will
here
say
that
after
writing
out
the
story
i
read
it
to
the
parties
personally
interested
and
they
give
me
leave
to
say
that
in
all
particulars
it
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
affair
except
that
lavinia
remarked
well
barnum
your
story
don
t
lose
any
by
the
telling
and
the
commodore
denies
the
rolling
tear
when
informed
of
the
engagement
of
the
little
pair
in
june
the
report
was
started
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
in
the
newspapers
that
commodore
nutt
and
miss
minnie
warren
were
married
this
time
at
west
haven
in
connecticut
the
story
was
wholly
untrue
nor
do
i
think
that
such
a
wedding
is
likely
to
take
place
for
on
the
principle
that
people
like
their
opposites
minnie
and
the
commodore
are
likely
to
marry
persons
whom
they
can
literally
look
up
to
that
is
if
either
of
them
marries
at
all
it
will
be
a
tall
partner
soon
after
the
wedding
of
general
tom
thumb
and
lavinia
warren
a
lady
came
to
my
office
and
called
my
attention
to
a
little
pamphlet
which
she
said
she
had
written
entitled
priests
and
pigmies
and
requested
me
to
read
it
i
glanced
at
the
title
and
at
once
estimating
the
character
of
the
publication
i
promptly
declined
to
devote
any
portion
of
my
valuable
time
to
its
perusal
but
you
had
better
look
at
it
barnum
it
deeply
interests
you
and
you
may
think
it
worth
your
while
to
buy
certainly
i
will
buy
it
if
you
desire
said
i
tendering
her
a
sixpence
which
i
supposed
to
be
the
price
of
the
little
pamphlet
oh
you
quite
misunderstand
me
i
mean
buy
the
copyright
and
the
entire
edition
with
the
view
of
suppressing
the
work
it
says
some
frightful
things
i
assure
you
urged
the
author
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
fairly
roared
at
this
exceedingly
feeble
attempt
at
but
persisted
the
lady
suppose
it
says
that
your
museum
and
grace
church
are
all
one
what
then
my
dear
madam
i
replied
you
may
say
what
you
please
about
me
or
about
my
museum
you
may
print
a
hundred
thousand
copies
of
a
pamphlet
stating
that
i
stole
the
communion
service
after
the
wedding
from
grace
church
altar
or
anything
else
you
choose
to
write
only
have
the
kindness
to
say
something
about
me
and
then
come
to
me
and
i
will
properly
estimate
the
money
value
of
your
services
to
me
as
an
advertising
agent

life
as
a
democrat
and
my
newspaper
the
of
was
a
journal
while
always
taking
an
active
interest
in
political
matters
i
had
no
desire
for
personal
preferment
and
up
to
a
late
period
steadily
declined
to
run
for
office
nevertheless
in
or
prominent
members
of
the
party
with
which
i
voted
urged
the
submission
of
my
name
to
the
state
convention
as
a
candidate
for
the
office
of
governor
and
although
the
party
was
then
in
the
ascendancy
and
a
nomination
would
have
been
equivalent
to
an
election
i
peremptorily
refused
in
spite
of
this
refusal
which
was
generally
known
several
votes
were
cast
for
me
in
the
convention
the
kansas
strifes
in
shook
my
faith
in
my
party
though
i
continued
to
call
myself
a
democrat
often
declaring
that
if
i
thought
there
was
a
drop
of
blood
in
me
that
was
not
democratic
i
would
let
it
out
if
i
had
to
cut
the
jugular
vein
when
however
secession
threatened
in
i
thought
it
was
time
for
a
new
departure
and
i
identified
myself
with
the
republican
party
during
the
active
and
exciting
political
campaign
of
which
resulted
in
lincoln
s
first
election
to
the
presidency
it
will
be
remembered
that
associations
with
their
uniforms
torches
and
processions
were
organized
in
nearly
every
city
town
and
village
throughout
the
north
arriving
at
bridgeport
from
new
york
at
five
o
clock
one
afternoon
i
was
informed
that
the
were
to
parade
that
evening
and
intended
to
march
out
to
lindencroft
so
i
ordered
two
boxes
of
sperm
candles
and
prepared
for
a
general
illumination
of
every
window
in
the
front
of
my
house
many
of
my
neighbors
including
several
democrats
came
to
lindencroft
in
the
evening
to
witness
the
illumination
and
see
the
procession
my
nearest
neighbor
was
a
strong
democrat
and
before
he
came
to
my
house
he
ordered
his
servants
to
stay
in
the
basement
and
not
to
show
a
light
above
ground
thus
intending
to
prove
his
democratic
convictions
and
conclusions
by
the
darkness
of
his
premises
and
so
while
lindencroft
was
all
ablaze
with
a
flood
of
light
the
next
house
was
as
black
as
a
my
neighbor
james
johnson
was
also
a
democrat
but
i
knew
he
would
not
spoil
a
good
joke
for
the
sake
of
politics
and
i
asked
him
to
engage
the
attention
of
and
and
to
keep
their
faces
turned
towards
bridgeport
and
the
approaching
procession
the
light
of
whose
torches
could
already
be
seen
in
the
distance
while
another
democratic
friend
george
a
wells
and
i
ran
over
and
illuminated
mr
s
house
this
we
did
with
great
success
completing
our
work
five
minutes
before
the
procession
arrived
as
the
turned
into
my
grounds
and
saw
that
the
house
of
was
brilliantly
illuminated
they
concluded
that
he
had
become
a
sudden
convert
to
republicanism
and
gave
three
rousing
cheers
for
him
hearing
his
name
thus
cheered
and
wondering
at
the
cause
he
happened
to
turn
and
see
that
his
house
was
lighted
up
from
basement
to
attic
and
uttering
a
single
profane
ejaculation
he
rushed
for
home
he
was
not
able
however
to
put
out
the
lights
till
the
had
gone
on
their
way
rejoicing
under
the
impression
that
one
more
republican
had
been
added
to
their
ranks
when
the
rebellion
broke
out
in
i
was
too
old
to
go
to
the
field
but
i
supplied
four
substitutes
and
contributed
liberally
from
my
means
for
the
cause
of
the
union
after
the
defeat
at
bull
run
july
peace
meetings
began
to
be
held
in
different
parts
of
the
northern
states
and
especially
in
fairfield
and
litchfield
counties
in
connecticut
it
was
usual
in
these
assemblages
to
display
a
white
flag
bearing
the
word
peace
above
the
national
flag
and
to
make
and
listen
to
harangues
denunciatory
of
the
war
one
of
these
meetings
was
advertised
to
be
held
august
at
stepney
ten
miles
north
of
bridgeport
on
the
morning
of
that
day
i
met
elias
howe
who
proposed
to
me
that
we
should
drive
up
to
stepney
attend
the
peace
meeting
and
hear
for
ourselves
whether
the
addresses
were
disloyal
or
not
we
agreed
to
meet
at
the
at
twelve
o
clock
at
noon
and
i
went
home
for
my
carriage
on
the
way
i
met
several
gentlemen
to
whom
i
communicated
my
intention
asking
them
to
go
also
and
as
howe
invited
several
of
his
friends
to
accompany
us
when
we
met
at
noon
at
least
twenty
gentlemen
were
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
with
their
carriages
ready
to
start
for
stepney
i
am
quite
confident
that
not
one
of
us
had
any
other
intention
in
going
to
this
meeting
than
to
quietly
listen
to
the
harangues
and
if
they
were
found
to
be
in
opposition
to
the
government
and
calculated
to
create
disturbance
or
disaffection
in
the
community
and
deter
enlistments
it
would
be
best
to
represent
the
matter
to
the
government
at
washington
and
ask
that
measures
might
be
taken
to
suppress
such
gatherings
as
we
turned
into
main
street
we
discovered
two
large
omnibuses
filled
with
soldiers
who
were
at
home
on
furlough
and
who
were
going
to
stepney
our
lighter
carriages
outran
them
and
so
arrived
at
stepney
in
time
to
see
the
white
peace
flag
run
up
over
the
stars
and
stripes
when
we
quietly
stood
in
the
crowd
while
the
meeting
was
organized
it
was
a
very
large
gathering
and
some
fifty
ladies
were
on
the
seats
in
front
of
the
platform
on
which
were
the
officers
and
speakers
of
the
meeting
a
preacher
charles
smith
was
invited
to
open
the
proceedings
with
prayer
and
the
military
and
civil
history
of
connecticut
during
the
war
of
by
croffut
and
john
morris
thus
continues
the
record
of
this
extraordinary
gathering
he
smith
had
not
however
progressed
far
in
his
supplication
when
he
slightly
opened
his
eyes
and
beheld
to
his
horror
the
bridgeport
omnibuses
coming
over
the
hill
garnished
with
union
banners
and
vocal
with
loyal
cheers
this
was
the
signal
for
a
panic
bull
run
on
a
small
scale
was
the
devout
smith
and
the
undelivered
orators
it
is
alleged
took
refuge
in
a
field
of
corn
the
procession
drove
straight
to
the
pole
unresisted
the
hostile
crowd
parting
to
let
them
pass
and
a
tall
man
john
platt
amid
some
mutterings
climbed
the
pole
reached
the
halliards
and
the
mongrel
banners
were
on
the
ground
some
of
the
rallying
drew
weapons
on
the
invaders
and
a
musket
and
a
revolver
were
taken
from
them
by
soldiers
at
the
very
instant
of
firing
another
of
the
defenders
fired
a
revolver
and
was
chased
into
the
fields
still
others
waxing
belligerent
were
disarmed
and
a
number
of
loaded
muskets
found
stored
in
an
adjacent
shed
were
seized
the
stars
and
stripes
were
hoisted
upon
the
pole
and
wildly
cheered
barnum
was
then
taken
on
the
shoulders
of
the
boys
in
blue
and
put
on
the
platform
where
he
made
a
speech
full
of
patriotism
spiced
with
the
humor
of
the
occasion
captain
james
dunham
also
said
a
few
words
to
the
point
the
star
spangled
banner
was
then
sung
in
chorus
and
a
series
of
resolutions
passed
declaring
that
loyal
men
are
the
rightful
custodians
of
the
peace
of
elias
howe
chairman
made
his
speech
when
the
crowd
threatened
to
shoot
the
speakers
if
they
fire
a
gun
boys
burn
the
whole
town
and
i
ll
pay
for
it
after
giving
the
citizens
wholesome
advice
concerning
the
substituted
flag
and
their
duty
to
the
government
the
procession
returned
to
bridgeport
with
the
white
flag
trailing
in
the
mud
behind
an
omnibus
they
were
received
at
bridgeport
by
approving
crowds
and
were
greeted
with
continuous
cheers
as
they
passed
on
our
way
back
to
bridgeport
the
soldiers
threatened
a
descent
upon
the
office
but
i
strongly
appealed
to
them
to
refrain
from
such
a
riotous
proceeding
telling
them
that
as
citizens
they
should
refrain
from
acts
of
violence
and
especially
should
make
no
appeal
to
the
passions
of
a
mob
so
confident
was
i
that
the
day
s
proceedings
had
ended
with
the
reception
of
the
soldiers
on
their
return
from
stepney
that
in
telegraphing
a
full
account
of
the
facts
to
the
new
york
papers
i
added
that
there
was
no
danger
of
an
attack
upon
the
office
since
leading
loyal
citizens
were
opposed
to
such
action
as
unnecessary
and
unwise
but
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
soldiers
had
been
received
and
the
excitement
of
the
day
prompted
them
to
break
through
their
resolutions
and
half
an
hour
after
my
telegram
had
been
sent
to
new
york
they
rushed
into
the
office
tumbled
the
type
into
the
street
and
broke
the
presses
i
did
not
approve
of
this
summary
suppression
of
the
paper
and
offered
the
proprietors
a
handsome
subscription
to
assist
in
enabling
them
to
renew
the
publication
of
the
one
of
the
editors
of
this
paper
went
south
and
connected
himself
with
a
journal
in
augusta
georgia
the
remaining
proprietor
shortly
afterwards
the
but
the
peace
meetings
which
had
been
advertised
for
different
towns
were
never
held
the
gathering
at
stepney
was
the
last
of
the
kind
elias
howe
although
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
and
well
advanced
in
years
enlisted
as
a
private
in
the
seventeenth
regiment
of
connecticut
volunteers
and
served
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
once
when
his
not
having
been
paid
off
were
in
need
of
money
he
advanced
due
them
and
when
his
regiment
was
disbanded
and
discharged
from
service
he
chartered
at
his
own
expense
a
special
train
to
bring
them
from
new
haven
to
bridgeport
where
they
had
a
public
reception
howe
like
all
men
of
his
reputed
wealth
and
liberality
was
constantly
besieged
by
solicitors
for
all
sorts
of
charities
nor
was
he
free
from
such
applications
when
he
was
serving
as
a
common
soldier
in
virginia
on
one
occasion
a
worthy
priest
came
to
him
and
asked
for
a
subscription
to
a
church
which
was
then
building
who
is
it
exclaimed
howe
that
talks
of
building
churches
in
this
time
of
war
the
priest
ventured
to
say
that
he
was
trying
to
build
in
his
parish
a
church
which
was
to
be
known
as
peter
s
st
peter
s
is
it
asked
howe
well
peter
was
in
his
way
a
fighting
man
he
drew
a
sword
once
and
cut
off
a
man
s
ear
on
the
whole
i
think
he
added
as
he
gave
a
handsome
sum
of
money
to
the
priest
i
must
do
something
for
peter
though
about
these
days
i
am
devoting
my
attention
and
money
mainly
to
after
the
draft
riots
in
new
york
and
in
other
cities
in
july
myself
and
other
members
of
the
prudential
committee
which
had
been
formed
in
bridgeport
were
frequently
threatened
with
personal
violence
and
rumors
were
especially
rife
that
lindencroft
would
some
night
be
mobbed
and
destroyed
on
several
occasions
soldiers
volunteered
as
a
guard
and
came
and
stayed
at
my
house
sometimes
for
several
nights
in
succession
and
i
was
also
provided
with
rockets
so
that
in
case
of
an
attempted
attack
i
could
signal
to
my
friends
in
the
city
and
especially
to
the
night
watchman
at
the
arsenal
who
would
see
my
rockets
at
lindencroft
and
give
the
alarm
happily
these
signals
were
never
needed
but
the
rockets
came
in
play
long
afterwards
in
another
way
my
house
was
provided
with
a
magnetic
and
one
night
the
faithful
bell
sounded
i
was
instantly
on
my
feet
and
summoning
my
servants
one
ran
and
rung
the
large
bell
on
the
lawn
which
served
in
the
day
time
to
call
my
coachman
from
the
stable
another
turned
on
the
gas
while
i
fired
a
gun
out
of
the
window
and
i
then
went
to
the
top
of
the
house
and
set
off
several
rockets
the
whole
region
round
about
was
instantly
aroused
dogs
barked
neighbors
but
armed
flocked
over
to
my
grounds
every
time
a
rocket
went
up
and
i
was
by
no
means
sparing
of
my
supply
the
whole
place
was
as
light
as
day
and
in
the
general
glare
and
confusion
we
caught
sight
of
two
retreating
burglars
one
running
one
way
the
other
another
way
and
both
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
nor
do
i
believe
that
the
plunderers
stopped
running
till
they
reached
new
york
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
a
man
who
takes
no
interest
in
politics
is
unfit
to
live
in
a
land
where
the
government
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
people
consequently
whether
i
expressed
them
or
not
i
always
had
pronounced
opinions
upon
all
the
leading
political
questions
of
the
day
and
no
frivolous
reason
ever
kept
me
from
the
polls
indeed
on
one
occasion
i
even
hastened
my
return
from
europe
so
that
i
could
take
part
in
a
presidential
election
i
was
a
party
man
but
not
a
partisan
nor
a
and
i
had
never
sought
or
desired
office
though
it
had
often
been
tendered
to
me
this
was
notoriously
true
among
all
who
knew
me
up
to
the
year
when
i
accepted
illustration
at
from
the
republican
party
a
nomination
to
the
connecticut
legislature
from
the
town
of
fairfield
and
i
did
this
because
i
felt
that
it
would
be
an
honor
to
be
permitted
to
vote
for
the
then
proposed
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
abolish
slavery
forever
from
the
land
i
was
elected
and
on
arriving
at
hartford
the
night
before
the
session
began
i
found
the
at
work
laying
their
plans
for
the
election
of
a
speaker
of
the
house
watching
the
movements
closely
i
saw
that
the
railroad
interests
had
combined
in
support
of
one
of
the
candidates
and
this
naturally
excited
my
suspicion
i
never
believed
in
making
state
legislation
a
mere
power
to
support
monopolies
i
do
not
need
to
declare
my
full
appreciation
of
the
great
blessings
which
railroad
interests
and
enterprises
have
brought
upon
this
country
and
the
world
but
the
vaster
the
enterprise
and
its
power
for
good
the
greater
its
opportunity
for
mischief
if
its
power
is
perverted
the
time
was
when
a
whole
community
was
tied
to
the
track
of
one
or
two
railway
companies
and
it
was
too
truthful
to
be
looked
upon
as
satire
to
call
new
jersey
the
state
of
camden
and
a
great
railroad
company
like
fire
is
a
good
servant
but
a
bad
master
and
when
it
is
considered
that
such
a
company
with
its
vast
number
of
men
dependent
upon
it
for
their
daily
bread
can
sometimes
elect
state
officers
and
legislatures
the
danger
to
our
free
institutions
from
such
a
force
may
well
be
feared
thinking
of
these
things
and
seeing
in
the
combination
of
railroad
interests
to
elect
a
speaker
no
promise
of
good
to
the
community
at
large
i
at
once
consulted
with
a
few
friends
in
the
legislature
and
we
resolved
to
defeat
the
railroad
ring
if
possible
in
caucus
i
had
not
even
seen
either
of
the
candidates
for
the
speakership
nor
had
i
a
single
selfish
end
in
view
to
gratify
by
the
election
of
one
candidate
or
the
other
but
i
felt
that
if
the
railroad
favorite
could
be
defeated
the
public
interest
would
be
subserved
we
succeeded
their
candidate
was
not
nominated
and
the
railroad
men
were
taken
by
surprise
they
had
had
their
own
way
in
every
legislature
since
the
first
railroad
was
laid
down
in
connecticut
and
to
be
beaten
now
fairly
startled
them
immediately
after
the
caucus
i
sought
the
successful
nominee
hon
foster
of
new
haven
and
begged
him
not
to
appoint
as
chairman
of
the
railroad
committee
the
man
who
had
held
that
office
for
several
successive
years
and
who
was
in
fact
the
great
railroad
factotum
in
the
state
he
complied
with
my
request
and
he
soon
found
how
important
it
was
to
check
the
strong
and
growing
monopoly
for
as
he
said
the
outside
pressure
from
personal
friends
in
both
political
parties
to
secure
the
appointment
of
the
person
to
whom
i
had
objected
was
terrible
though
i
had
not
foreseen
nor
thought
of
such
a
thing
until
i
reached
hartford
i
soon
found
that
a
battle
with
the
railroad
commissioners
would
be
necessary
and
my
course
was
shaped
accordingly
it
was
soon
discovered
that
a
majority
of
the
railroad
commissioners
were
mere
tools
in
the
hands
of
the
railroad
companies
and
that
one
of
them
was
actually
a
hired
clerk
in
the
office
of
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
company
it
was
also
shown
that
the
chairman
of
the
railroad
commissioners
permitted
most
of
the
accidents
which
occurred
on
that
road
to
be
taken
charge
of
and
reported
upon
by
the
paid
lobby
agent
of
that
railroad
this
was
so
manifestly
destructive
to
the
interests
of
all
parties
who
might
suffer
from
accidents
on
the
road
or
have
any
controversy
therefor
with
the
company
that
i
succeeded
in
enlisting
the
farmers
and
other
true
men
on
the
side
of
right
and
we
defeated
the
chairman
of
the
railroad
commissioners
who
was
a
candidate
for
and
elected
our
own
candidate
in
his
place
i
also
carried
through
a
law
that
no
person
who
was
in
the
employ
of
any
railroad
in
the
state
should
serve
as
railroad
commissioner
but
the
great
struggle
which
lasted
nearly
through
the
entire
session
was
upon
the
subject
of
railroad
passenger
commutations
commodore
vanderbilt
had
secured
control
of
the
hudson
river
and
harlem
railroads
and
had
increased
the
price
of
commuters
tickets
from
two
hundred
to
four
hundred
per
cent
many
men
living
on
the
line
of
these
roads
at
distances
of
from
ten
to
fifty
miles
from
new
york
had
built
fine
residences
in
the
country
on
the
strength
of
cheap
transit
to
and
from
the
city
and
were
compelled
to
submit
to
the
extortion
commodore
vanderbilt
was
a
large
shareholder
in
the
new
york
and
new
haven
road
indeed
subsequent
elections
showed
that
he
had
a
controlling
interest
and
it
seemed
evident
to
me
that
the
same
practice
would
be
put
in
operation
on
the
new
haven
railroad
that
commuters
were
groaning
under
on
the
two
other
roads
i
enlisted
as
many
as
i
could
in
an
effort
to
strangle
this
outrage
before
it
became
too
strong
to
grapple
with
several
lawyers
in
the
assembly
had
promised
me
their
aid
but
long
before
the
final
struggle
came
every
lawyer
except
one
in
that
body
was
enlisted
in
favor
of
the
railroads
what
potent
influence
had
been
at
work
with
these
legal
gentlemen
could
only
be
surmised
certain
it
is
that
all
the
railroad
interests
in
the
state
were
combined
and
while
they
had
plenty
of
money
with
which
to
carry
out
their
designs
and
desires
the
chances
looked
slim
in
favor
of
those
members
of
the
legislature
who
had
no
pecuniary
interest
in
the
matter
but
were
struggling
simply
for
justice
and
the
protection
of
the
people
but
yankee
was
always
a
noted
feature
in
my
character
every
inch
of
the
ground
was
fought
over
day
after
day
before
the
legislative
railroad
committee
examinations
and
of
railroad
commissioners
and
lobbyists
were
kept
up
scarcely
more
than
one
man
senator
ballard
of
darien
aided
me
personally
in
the
investigations
which
took
place
but
he
was
a
host
in
himself
and
we
left
not
a
stone
unturned
we
succeeded
by
our
persistence
in
letting
in
considerable
light
upon
a
dark
subject
the
man
whom
i
had
prevented
from
being
made
chairman
succeeded
in
becoming
a
member
of
the
railroad
committee
but
from
the
mouths
of
unwilling
witnesses
i
exhibited
his
connection
with
railroad
reports
railroad
laws
and
railroad
lobbyings
in
such
a
light
that
he
took
to
his
bed
some
ten
days
before
the
end
of
the
session
and
actually
remained
there
sick
as
he
said
till
the
legislature
adjourned
the
speaker
offered
me
the
chairmanship
of
any
one
of
several
committees
and
i
selected
that
of
the
agricultural
committee
because
it
would
occupy
but
little
of
my
time
and
give
me
the
opportunity
i
so
much
desired
to
devote
my
attention
to
the
railway
combinations
the
republicans
had
a
majority
in
both
branches
of
the
legislature
the
democrats
however
were
watchful
and
energetic
the
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
abolishing
slavery
met
with
but
little
open
opposition
but
the
proposed
amendment
to
the
state
constitution
striking
out
the
word
white
from
that
clause
which
defined
the
qualifications
of
voters
was
violently
opposed
by
the
democratic
members
the
report
from
the
minority
of
the
committee
to
whom
the
question
was
referred
gave
certain
reasons
for
offering
the
contemplated
amendment
and
in
reply
to
this
i
spoke
may
as
follows
speech
of
barnum
on
the
constitutional
amendment
speaker
i
will
not
attempt
to
notice
at
any
length
the
declamation
of
the
honorable
gentleman
from
milford
for
certainly
i
have
heard
nothing
from
his
lips
approaching
to
the
dignity
of
argument
i
agree
with
the
gentleman
that
the
right
of
suffrage
is
dearly
and
sacredly
cherished
by
the
white
man
and
it
is
because
this
right
is
so
dear
and
sacred
that
i
wish
to
see
it
extended
to
every
educated
moral
man
within
our
state
without
regard
to
color
he
tells
us
that
one
race
is
a
vessel
to
honor
and
another
to
dishonor
and
that
he
has
seen
on
ancient
egyptian
monuments
the
negro
represented
as
a
hewer
of
wood
and
a
drawer
of
this
is
doubtless
true
and
the
gentleman
seems
determined
always
to
the
negro
a
vessel
of
dishonor
and
a
hewer
of
we
on
the
other
hand
propose
to
give
him
the
opportunity
of
expanding
his
faculties
and
elevating
himself
to
true
manhood
he
says
he
hates
and
abhors
and
despises
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
it
and
i
trust
we
shall
see
tangible
evidence
of
the
truth
of
what
he
professes
in
his
abandonment
of
that
slavery
to
party
which
is
the
mere
trick
and
trap
of
the
demagogue
when
a
few
days
since
this
honorable
body
voted
unanimously
for
the
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
abolishing
human
slavery
i
not
only
thanked
god
from
my
heart
of
hearts
but
i
felt
like
going
down
on
my
knees
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
opposition
for
the
wisdom
they
had
exhibited
in
bowing
to
the
logic
of
events
by
dropping
that
dead
weight
of
slavery
which
had
disrupted
the
democratic
party
with
which
i
had
been
so
long
connected
and
on
this
occasion
i
wish
again
to
appeal
to
the
wisdom
and
loyalty
of
my
democratic
friends
i
say
democratic
friends
for
i
am
and
ever
was
a
thorough
out
and
out
democrat
i
supported
general
jackson
and
voted
for
every
democratic
president
after
him
up
to
and
including
pierce
for
i
really
thought
pierce
was
a
democrat
until
he
proved
the
contrary
as
i
conceived
in
the
kansas
question
my
democracy
goes
for
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
for
equal
and
exact
justice
to
all
men
and
for
a
submission
to
the
will
of
the
majority
if
i
thought
i
had
one
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
which
was
not
democratic
in
the
light
of
this
definition
i
would
have
it
out
no
matter
at
what
trouble
or
sacrifice
it
was
the
repudiation
by
the
southern
democracy
of
this
great
democratic
doctrine
of
majority
rule
which
opened
the
rebellion
and
now
speaker
let
me
remind
our
democratic
friends
that
the
present
question
simply
asks
that
a
majority
of
the
legal
voters
the
white
citizens
of
this
state
may
decide
whether
or
not
colored
men
of
good
moral
character
are
able
to
and
who
possess
all
the
qualifications
of
white
voters
shall
be
entitled
to
the
elective
franchise
the
opposition
may
have
their
own
ideas
or
may
be
in
doubt
upon
this
subject
but
surely
no
true
democrat
will
dare
to
refuse
permission
to
our
to
decide
the
question
negro
slavery
and
its
legitimate
outgrowths
of
ignorance
tyranny
and
oppression
have
caused
this
gigantic
rebellion
which
has
cost
our
country
thousands
of
millions
of
treasure
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
human
lives
in
defending
a
principle
and
where
was
this
poor
colored
race
in
this
rebellion
did
they
seize
the
opportunity
when
their
masters
were
engaged
with
a
powerful
foe
to
break
out
in
insurrection
and
massacre
those
tyrants
who
had
so
long
held
them
in
the
most
cruel
bondage
no
speaker
they
did
not
do
this
my
democratic
friends
would
have
done
it
i
would
have
done
it
irishmen
chinamen
portuguese
would
have
done
it
any
white
man
would
have
done
it
but
the
poor
black
man
is
like
a
lamb
in
his
nature
compared
with
the
white
man
the
black
man
possesses
a
confiding
disposition
thoroughly
tinctured
with
religious
enthusiasm
and
not
characterized
by
a
spirit
of
revenge
no
the
only
barbarous
massacres
we
heard
of
during
the
war
were
those
committed
by
their
white
masters
on
their
poor
defenceless
white
prisoners
and
to
the
eternal
disgrace
of
southern
white
democratic
rebels
be
it
said
these
instances
of
barbarism
were
numerous
all
through
the
war
when
this
rebellion
first
broke
out
the
northern
democracy
raised
a
against
permitting
the
negroes
to
fight
but
when
such
a
measure
seemed
necessary
in
order
to
put
down
traitors
these
colored
men
took
their
muskets
in
hand
and
made
their
bodies
a
wall
of
defence
for
the
loyal
citizens
of
the
north
and
now
when
our
grateful
white
citizens
ask
from
this
assembly
the
privilege
of
deciding
by
their
votes
whether
these
colored
men
who
at
least
were
partially
our
saviors
in
the
war
may
or
may
not
under
proper
restrictions
become
participants
in
that
great
salvation
i
am
amazed
that
men
calling
themselves
democrats
dare
refuse
to
grant
this
democratic
measure
we
wish
to
educate
ignorant
men
white
or
black
ignorance
is
incompatible
with
the
genius
of
our
free
institutions
in
the
very
nature
of
things
it
jeopardizes
their
stability
and
it
is
always
unsafe
to
transgress
the
laws
of
nature
we
can
not
safely
shut
ourselves
up
with
ignorance
and
brutality
we
must
educate
and
christianize
those
who
are
now
by
circumstances
our
social
inferiors
years
ago
i
was
afraid
of
foreign
voters
i
feared
that
when
europe
poured
her
teeming
millions
of
working
people
upon
our
shores
our
extended
laws
of
franchise
would
enable
them
to
swamp
our
free
institutions
and
reduce
us
to
anarchy
but
much
reflection
has
satisfied
me
that
we
have
only
to
elevate
these
millions
and
their
descendants
to
the
standard
of
american
citizenship
and
we
shall
find
sufficient
of
the
leaven
of
liberty
in
our
system
of
government
to
absorb
all
foreign
elements
and
assimilate
them
to
a
truly
democratic
form
of
government
speaker
we
can
not
afford
to
carry
passengers
and
have
them
live
under
our
government
with
no
real
vital
interest
in
its
perpetuity
every
man
must
be
a
joint
owner
the
only
safe
inhabitants
of
a
free
country
are
educated
citizens
who
vote
the
gentleman
from
milford
lives
near
the
old
washington
which
spans
the
housatonic
river
and
he
doubtless
remembers
as
i
do
when
the
boston
and
new
york
stages
crossed
that
bridge
and
the
coachman
would
always
denounce
the
infernal
bridge
monopoly
which
compelled
him
to
pay
a
dollar
every
time
the
stage
crossed
the
passengers
would
generally
laugh
and
say
let
him
pay
it
s
nothing
to
us
we
are
only
some
twenty
years
ago
one
of
the
gentlemen
accustomed
to
travel
in
that
stage
was
crossing
the
atlantic
in
a
steamship
at
the
hour
of
midnight
when
nearly
all
were
wrapt
in
sleep
the
fearful
cry
of
fire
rang
through
the
ship
there
were
the
poor
passengers
threatened
by
the
devouring
element
and
only
a
plank
between
them
and
death
our
passenger
not
half
awake
rubbed
his
eyes
and
probably
fancying
he
was
in
the
old
cried
out
fire
away
i
am
only
a
passenger
fortunately
it
was
a
false
alarm
but
when
the
gentleman
was
wide
awake
he
discovered
that
there
could
be
no
disinterested
passengers
on
board
a
burning
ship
nor
in
a
free
government
can
we
afford
to
employ
journeymen
they
may
be
apprenticed
until
they
learn
to
read
and
study
our
institutions
and
then
let
them
become
joint
proprietors
and
feel
a
proportionate
responsibility
the
two
learned
and
distinguished
authors
of
the
minority
report
have
been
studying
the
science
of
ethnology
and
have
treated
us
with
a
dissertation
on
the
races
and
what
have
they
attempted
to
show
why
that
a
race
which
simply
on
account
of
the
color
of
the
skin
has
long
been
buried
in
slavery
at
the
south
and
even
at
the
north
has
been
tabooed
and
scarcely
permitted
to
rise
above
the
dignity
of
whitewashers
and
does
not
exhibit
the
same
polish
and
refinement
that
the
white
citizens
do
who
have
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
civilization
education
christian
culture
and
which
can
only
be
attained
by
those
who
share
in
making
the
laws
under
which
they
live
do
our
democratic
friends
assume
that
the
negroes
are
not
human
i
have
heard
professed
democrats
claim
even
that
but
do
the
authors
of
this
minority
report
insist
that
the
negro
is
a
beast
is
his
body
not
tenanted
by
an
immortal
spirit
if
this
is
the
position
of
the
gentlemen
then
i
confess
a
beast
can
not
reason
and
this
minority
committee
are
right
in
declaring
that
the
negro
can
develop
no
inventive
faculties
or
genius
for
the
for
although
the
elephant
may
be
taught
to
plow
or
the
dog
to
carry
your
by
his
teeth
you
can
not
teach
them
to
shave
notes
to
speculate
in
gold
or
even
to
vote
whereas
the
experience
of
all
political
parties
shows
that
men
may
be
taught
to
vote
even
when
they
do
not
know
what
the
ticket
means
but
if
the
colored
man
is
indeed
a
man
then
his
manhood
with
proper
training
can
be
developed
his
soul
may
appear
dormant
his
brain
inactive
but
there
is
a
vitality
there
and
nature
will
assert
herself
if
you
will
give
her
the
opportunity
suppose
an
inhabitant
of
another
planet
should
drop
down
upon
this
portion
of
our
globe
at
he
would
find
the
earth
covered
with
snow
and
ice
and
congealed
almost
to
the
consistency
of
granite
the
trees
are
leafless
everything
is
cold
and
barren
no
green
thing
is
to
be
seen
the
inhabitants
are
chilled
and
stalk
about
shivering
from
place
to
place
he
would
exclaim
surely
this
is
not
life
this
means
annihilation
no
flesh
and
blood
can
long
endure
this
this
frozen
earth
is
bound
in
the
everlasting
embraces
of
adamantine
frost
and
can
never
develop
vegetation
for
the
sustenance
of
any
living
he
little
dreams
of
the
priceless
myriads
of
germs
which
bountiful
nature
has
safely
garnered
in
the
warm
bosom
of
our
mother
earth
he
sees
no
evidence
of
that
vitality
which
the
beneficent
sun
will
develop
to
grace
and
beautify
the
world
but
let
him
remain
until
march
or
april
and
as
the
snow
begins
to
melt
away
he
discovers
the
beautiful
crocus
struggling
through
the
ground
the
appear
in
all
their
chaste
beauty
the
buds
of
the
shoot
forth
the
beautiful
magnolia
opens
her
splendid
blossoms
the
sassafras
adds
its
evidence
of
life
the
blossoms
of
the
light
up
every
forest
and
while
our
stranger
is
rubbing
his
eyes
in
astonishment
the
earth
is
covered
with
her
emerald
velvet
carpet
rich
foliage
and
brilliant
colored
blossoms
adorn
the
trees
fragrant
flowers
are
enwreathing
every
wayside
the
birds
float
through
the
air
and
send
forth
joyful
notes
of
gratitude
from
every
the
merry
lambs
skip
joyfully
around
their
verdant
pasture
grounds
and
everywhere
is
our
stranger
surrounded
with
life
beauty
joy
and
gladness
so
it
is
with
the
poor
african
you
may
take
a
dozen
specimens
of
both
sexes
from
the
lowest
type
of
man
found
in
africa
their
race
has
been
buried
for
ages
in
ignorance
and
barbarism
and
you
can
scarcely
perceive
that
they
have
any
more
of
manhood
or
womanhood
than
so
many
or
gorillas
you
look
at
their
low
foreheads
their
thick
skulls
and
lips
their
woolly
heads
their
flat
noses
their
dull
lazy
eyes
and
you
may
be
tempted
to
adopt
the
language
of
this
minority
committee
and
exclaim
surely
these
people
have
no
inventive
faculties
no
genius
for
the
arts
or
for
any
of
those
occupations
requiring
intellect
and
but
bring
them
out
into
the
light
of
civilization
let
them
and
their
children
come
into
the
genial
sunshine
of
christianity
teach
them
industry
and
let
them
learn
what
too
few
white
christians
have
yet
understood
that
cleanliness
is
akin
to
godliness
and
a
part
of
godliness
and
the
human
soul
will
begin
to
develop
itself
each
generation
blessed
with
churches
and
common
schools
will
gradually
exhibit
the
result
of
such
culture
the
low
foreheads
will
be
raised
and
widened
by
an
active
and
expanded
brain
the
vacant
eye
of
barbarism
ignorance
and
idleness
will
light
up
with
the
fire
of
intelligence
education
ambition
activity
and
christian
civilization
and
you
will
find
the
immortal
soul
asserting
her
dignity
by
the
development
of
a
man
who
would
startle
by
his
intelligence
the
honorable
gentleman
from
wallingford
who
has
presumed
to
compare
beings
made
in
god
s
image
with
oxen
and
that
honorable
gentleman
if
he
is
rightly
reported
in
the
papers
i
did
not
have
the
happiness
to
hear
his
speech
has
mistaken
the
nature
of
the
colored
man
the
honorable
gentleman
reminds
me
of
the
young
man
who
went
abroad
and
when
he
returned
there
was
nothing
in
america
that
could
compare
with
what
he
had
seen
in
foreign
lands
niagara
falls
was
nowhere
the
white
mountains
were
knocked
higher
than
a
kite
by
mont
blanc
our
rivers
were
so
large
that
they
were
vulgar
when
contrasted
with
the
beautiful
little
streams
and
rivulets
of
europe
our
new
york
central
park
was
eclipsed
by
the
bois
de
bologne
and
the
champs
elysÃ©es
of
paris
or
hyde
or
regent
park
of
london
to
say
nothing
of
the
great
phÅnix
park
at
dublin
they
have
introduced
a
couple
of
venetian
gondolas
on
the
large
pond
in
central
park
remarked
a
friend
all
very
well
replied
the
verdant
traveller
but
between
you
and
me
these
birds
can
t
stand
our
cold
climate
more
than
one
the
gentleman
from
wallingford
evidently
had
as
little
idea
of
the
true
nature
of
the
african
as
the
young
swell
had
of
the
of
venice
johnson
of
wallingford
the
gentleman
misapprehends
my
remarks
the
gentleman
from
norwich
had
urged
that
the
negro
should
vote
because
they
have
fought
in
our
battles
i
replied
that
oxen
and
asses
can
fight
and
therefore
should
on
the
same
grounds
be
entitled
to
vote
barnum
i
accept
the
gentleman
s
explanation
doubtless
general
grant
will
feel
himself
highly
complimented
when
he
learns
that
it
requires
no
greater
capacity
to
handle
the
musket
and
meet
armed
battalions
in
the
field
than
oxen
and
asses
possess
let
the
educated
free
negro
feel
that
he
is
a
man
let
him
be
trained
in
new
england
churches
schools
and
workshops
let
him
support
himself
pay
his
taxes
and
cast
his
vote
like
other
men
and
he
will
put
to
everlasting
shame
the
champions
of
modern
democracy
by
the
overwhelming
evidence
he
will
give
in
his
own
person
of
the
great
scripture
truth
that
god
has
made
of
one
blood
all
the
nations
of
a
human
soul
that
god
has
created
and
christ
died
for
is
not
to
be
trifled
with
it
may
tenant
the
body
of
a
chinaman
a
turk
an
arab
or
a
hottentot
it
is
still
an
immortal
spirit
and
amid
all
assumptions
of
caste
it
will
in
due
time
vindicate
the
great
fact
that
without
regard
to
color
or
condition
all
men
are
equally
children
of
the
common
father
a
few
years
since
an
english
lord
and
his
family
were
riding
in
his
carriage
in
liverpool
it
was
an
elegant
equipage
the
servants
were
dressed
in
rich
livery
the
horses
caparisoned
in
the
most
costly
style
and
everything
betokened
that
the
establishment
belonged
to
a
scion
of
england
s
proudest
aristocracy
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
a
palatial
residence
at
this
moment
a
poor
beggar
woman
rushed
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
gently
seizing
the
lady
by
the
hand
exclaimed
for
the
love
of
god
give
me
something
to
save
my
poor
sick
children
from
starvation
you
are
rich
i
am
your
poor
sister
for
god
is
our
common
wretch
exclaimed
the
proud
lady
casting
the
woman
s
hand
away
don
t
call
me
sister
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
such
low
brutes
as
and
the
great
lady
doubtless
thought
she
was
formed
of
finer
clay
than
this
suffering
mendicant
but
when
a
few
days
afterwards
she
was
brought
to
a
sick
bed
by
the
contracted
by
touching
the
hand
of
that
poor
wretch
she
felt
the
evidence
that
they
belonged
to
the
same
great
family
and
were
subject
to
the
same
pains
and
diseases
the
state
of
connecticut
like
new
jersey
is
a
border
state
of
new
york
new
york
has
a
great
commercial
city
where
aldermen
rob
by
the
tens
of
thousands
and
where
principal
is
studied
much
more
than
principle
i
can
readily
understand
how
the
negro
has
come
to
be
debased
at
the
north
as
well
as
at
the
south
the
interests
of
the
two
sections
in
the
product
of
negro
labor
were
nearly
identical
the
north
wanted
southern
cotton
and
the
south
was
ready
in
turn
to
buy
from
the
north
whatever
was
needed
in
the
way
of
northern
supplies
and
manufactures
this
community
of
commercial
interests
led
to
an
identity
in
political
principles
especially
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
negro
race
the
working
race
of
the
south
which
produced
the
cotton
and
consumed
so
much
of
what
northern
merchants
and
manufacturers
sold
for
plantation
use
the
southern
planters
were
good
customers
and
were
worth
conciliating
so
when
connecticut
proposed
in
to
continue
to
admit
colored
men
to
the
franchise
the
south
protested
against
thus
elevating
the
negroes
and
connecticut
succumbed
no
other
new
england
state
has
ever
so
disgraced
herself
and
now
connecticut
democrats
are
asked
to
permit
the
white
citizens
of
this
state
to
express
their
opinion
in
regard
to
the
colored
man
where
our
revolutionary
sires
placed
him
under
the
constitution
now
gentlemen
democrats
as
you
call
yourselves
you
who
speak
so
flippantly
of
your
loyalty
your
love
for
the
union
and
your
love
for
the
people
you
who
are
generally
talking
right
and
voting
wrong
we
ask
you
to
come
forward
and
act
democratically
by
letting
your
masters
the
people
speak
the
word
white
in
the
constitution
can
not
be
strictly
and
literally
construed
the
opposition
express
great
love
for
white
blood
will
they
let
a
mulatto
vote
half
the
time
a
quadroon
and
an
octoroon
of
the
time
if
not
why
not
will
they
enslave
of
a
white
man
because
is
not
caucasian
is
this
democratic
shall
not
the
majority
seven
control
the
minority
one
out
on
such
but
a
democratic
minority
committee
of
two
seem
to
have
done
something
besides
study
ethnology
they
have
also
paid
great
attention
to
fine
arts
and
are
particularly
anxious
that
all
voters
shall
have
a
genius
for
the
i
would
like
to
ask
them
if
it
has
always
been
political
practice
to
insist
that
every
voter
in
the
great
unwashed
and
unterrified
of
any
party
should
become
a
member
of
the
academy
of
arts
before
he
votes
the
regular
ticket
i
thought
he
was
received
into
the
full
fellowship
of
a
political
party
if
he
could
exhibit
sufficient
inventive
faculties
and
genius
for
the
arts
to
enable
him
to
paint
a
black
eye
can
a
man
whose
genius
for
the
arts
enables
him
to
strike
from
the
shoulder
scientifically
be
admitted
to
full
fellowship
in
a
political
party
is
it
evident
that
the
political
artist
has
studied
the
old
masters
if
he
exhibits
his
genius
by
tapping
an
opponent
s
head
with
a
shillelagh
the
oldest
master
in
this
school
of
art
was
cain
and
so
canes
have
been
made
to
play
their
part
in
politics
at
the
polls
and
even
in
the
united
states
senate
chamber
is
genius
for
the
arts
and
those
occupations
requiring
intellect
and
wisdom
sufficiently
exemplified
in
adroitly
stuffing
ballot
boxes
forging
soldiers
votes
and
copying
a
directory
as
has
been
done
as
the
return
list
of
votes
is
the
inventive
faculty
of
voting
early
and
often
a
passport
to
political
brotherhood
is
it
satisfactory
evidence
of
artistic
genius
to
head
a
mob
and
a
mob
which
is
led
and
guided
by
political
passion
as
numerous
instances
in
our
history
prove
is
the
worst
of
mobs
is
it
evidence
of
high
art
to
lynch
a
man
by
hanging
him
to
the
nearest
tree
or
lamp
post
is
a
whiskey
scrimmage
one
of
the
lost
arts
restored
we
all
know
how
the
artists
of
both
political
parties
are
prone
to
embellish
elections
and
to
enhance
the
excitements
of
political
campaigns
by
inciting
riots
and
the
frequency
with
which
these
disgraceful
outbreaks
have
occurred
of
late
especially
in
some
of
the
populous
cities
is
cause
for
just
alarm
it
is
dangerous
speaker
i
repeat
that
i
am
a
friend
to
the
irishman
i
have
travelled
through
his
native
country
and
have
seen
how
he
is
oppressed
i
have
listened
to
the
eloquent
and
patriotic
appeals
of
daniel
o
connell
in
conciliation
hall
in
dublin
and
i
have
gladly
contributed
to
his
fund
for
ameliorating
the
condition
of
his
countrymen
i
rejoice
to
see
them
rushing
to
this
land
of
liberty
and
independence
and
it
is
because
i
am
their
friend
that
i
denounce
the
demagogues
who
attempt
to
blind
and
mislead
them
to
vote
in
the
interests
of
any
party
against
the
interests
of
humanity
and
the
principles
of
true
democracy
my
neighbors
will
testify
that
at
i
employ
irishmen
by
the
hundred
to
do
work
that
is
not
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
help
them
support
their
families
after
hearing
the
minority
report
last
week
i
began
to
feel
that
i
might
be
disfranchised
for
i
have
no
great
degree
of
genius
for
the
arts
i
felt
therefore
that
i
must
get
posted
on
that
subject
as
soon
as
possible
i
at
once
sauntered
into
the
senate
chamber
to
look
at
the
paintings
there
i
saw
portraits
of
great
men
and
i
saw
two
empty
frames
from
which
the
pictures
had
been
removed
these
missing
paintings
i
was
told
were
portraits
of
two
of
the
state
whose
position
on
political
affairs
was
obnoxious
to
the
dominant
party
in
the
legislature
and
especially
obnoxious
were
the
supposed
sentiments
of
these
governors
on
the
war
therefore
the
senate
voted
to
remove
the
pictures
and
thus
proved
as
it
would
seem
that
there
is
an
intimate
connection
between
politics
and
art
i
have
repeatedly
travelled
through
every
state
in
the
south
and
i
assert
what
every
intelligent
officer
and
soldier
who
has
resided
there
will
corroborate
that
the
slaves
as
a
body
are
more
intelligent
than
the
poor
whites
no
man
who
has
not
been
there
can
conceive
to
what
a
low
depth
of
ignorance
the
poor
whites
of
some
portion
of
the
south
have
descended
i
trust
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
the
common
school
shall
throw
its
illuminating
rays
through
this
egyptian
pall
i
have
known
slave
mechanics
to
be
sold
for
and
even
each
and
others
could
not
be
bought
at
all
and
i
have
seen
intelligent
slaves
acting
as
stewards
for
their
masters
travelling
every
year
to
new
orleans
nashville
and
even
to
cincinnati
to
dispose
of
their
master
s
crops
the
free
colored
citizens
of
opelousas
martinsville
and
all
the
attakapas
country
in
louisiana
are
as
respectable
and
intelligent
as
an
ordinary
community
of
whites
they
speak
the
french
and
english
languages
educate
their
children
in
music
and
the
arts
and
they
pay
their
taxes
on
more
than
fifteen
millions
of
dollars
gentlemen
of
the
opposition
i
beseech
you
to
remember
that
our
state
and
our
country
ask
from
us
something
more
than
party
tactics
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
loyal
blacks
at
the
south
should
vote
in
order
to
save
the
loyal
whites
let
connecticut
without
regard
to
party
set
them
an
example
that
shall
influence
the
action
at
the
south
and
prevent
a
new
form
of
slavery
from
arising
there
which
shall
make
all
our
expenditure
of
blood
and
treasure
fruitless
but
some
persons
have
this
color
prejudice
simply
by
the
force
of
education
and
they
say
well
a
nigger
is
a
nigger
and
he
can
t
be
anything
else
i
hate
niggers
twenty
years
ago
i
crossed
the
atlantic
and
among
our
passengers
was
an
irish
judge
who
was
coming
out
to
newfoundland
as
chief
justice
he
was
an
exceedingly
intelligent
and
polished
gentleman
and
extremely
witty
the
passengers
from
the
new
england
states
and
those
from
the
south
got
into
a
discussion
on
the
subject
of
slavery
which
lasted
three
days
the
southerners
were
finally
worsted
and
when
their
arguments
were
exhausted
they
fell
back
on
the
old
story
by
saying
oh
curse
a
nigger
he
ain
t
half
human
anyhow
he
had
no
business
to
be
a
nigger
one
of
the
gentlemen
then
turned
to
the
irish
judge
and
asked
his
opinion
of
the
merits
of
the
controversy
the
judge
replied
gentlemen
i
have
listened
with
much
edification
to
your
arguments
pro
and
con
during
three
days
i
was
quite
inclined
to
think
the
gentlemen
had
justice
and
right
on
their
side
but
the
last
argument
from
the
south
has
changed
my
mind
i
say
a
nigger
has
no
business
to
be
a
nigger
and
we
should
kick
him
out
of
society
and
trample
him
under
foot
always
provided
gentlemen
you
prove
he
was
born
black
at
his
own
particular
request
if
he
had
no
word
to
say
in
the
matter
of
course
he
is
blameless
for
his
color
and
is
entitled
to
the
same
respect
that
other
men
are
who
properly
behave
themselves
speaker
i
am
no
politician
i
came
to
this
legislature
simply
because
i
wished
to
have
the
honor
of
voting
for
the
two
constitutional
amendments
one
for
driving
slavery
entirely
out
of
our
country
the
other
to
allow
men
of
education
and
good
moral
character
to
vote
regardless
of
the
color
of
their
skins
to
give
my
voice
for
these
two
philanthropic
just
and
christian
measures
is
all
the
glory
i
ask
legislativewise
i
care
nothing
whatever
for
any
sect
or
party
under
heaven
as
such
i
have
no
axes
to
grind
no
logs
to
roll
no
favors
to
ask
all
i
desire
is
to
do
what
is
right
and
prevent
what
is
wrong
i
believe
in
no
expediency
that
is
not
predicated
of
justice
for
in
all
things
politics
as
well
as
everything
else
i
know
that
honesty
is
the
best
a
retributive
providence
will
unerringly
and
speedily
search
out
all
wrong
doing
hence
right
is
always
the
best
in
the
long
run
certainly
in
the
light
of
the
great
american
spirit
of
liberty
and
equal
rights
which
is
sweeping
over
this
country
and
making
the
thrones
of
tyrants
totter
in
the
old
world
no
party
can
afford
to
carry
slavery
either
of
body
or
of
mind
knock
off
your
manacles
and
let
the
man
go
free
take
down
the
blinds
from
his
intellect
and
let
in
the
light
of
education
and
christian
culture
when
this
is
done
you
have
developed
a
man
give
him
the
responsibility
of
a
man
and
the
of
a
man
by
granting
him
the
right
of
suffrage
let
universal
education
and
the
universal
franchise
be
the
motto
of
free
america
and
the
toiling
millions
of
europe
who
are
watching
you
with
such
intense
interest
will
hail
us
as
their
saviors
let
us
loyally
sink
party
on
this
question
and
go
for
god
and
our
let
no
man
attach
an
eternal
stigma
to
his
name
by
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
great
lesson
of
the
hour
and
voting
against
permitting
the
people
to
express
their
opinion
on
this
important
subject
let
us
unanimously
grant
this
truly
democratic
boon
then
when
our
laws
of
franchise
are
settled
on
a
just
basis
let
future
parties
divide
where
they
honestly
differ
on
state
or
national
questions
which
do
not
trench
upon
the
claims
of

sun
said
about
it
the
new
museum
opening
the
establishment
to
the
public
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
july
i
was
speaking
in
the
connecticut
legislature
in
session
at
hartford
against
the
railroad
schemes
when
a
telegram
was
handed
to
me
from
my
hurd
my
assistant
manager
in
new
york
stating
that
the
american
museum
was
in
flames
and
that
its
total
destruction
was
certain
i
glanced
over
the
despatch
folded
it
laid
it
on
my
desk
and
calmly
continued
my
speech
as
if
nothing
had
happened
at
the
conclusion
of
my
remarks
the
bill
i
had
been
advocating
was
carried
and
the
house
adjourned
i
then
handed
the
telegram
announcing
my
great
loss
in
new
york
to
my
friend
and
william
coe
of
winsted
who
immediately
communicated
the
intelligence
to
several
members
warm
sympathizers
at
once
crowded
around
me
and
henry
harrison
of
new
haven
my
strongest
railroad
opponent
pushing
forward
seized
me
by
the
hand
and
said
mr
barnum
i
am
really
very
sorry
to
hear
of
your
great
sorry
i
replied
why
my
dear
sir
i
shall
not
have
time
to
be
sorry
in
a
week
it
will
take
me
that
length
of
time
before
i
can
get
over
laughing
at
having
whipped
you
all
so
nicely
in
this
attempted
railroad
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
my
all
testified
that
neither
my
face
nor
my
manner
betrayed
the
slightest
intimation
when
i
read
the
telegram
that
i
had
received
unpleasant
intelligence
one
of
the
local
journals
speaking
of
this
incident
two
days
after
the
fire
said
in
the
midst
of
barnum
s
speech
a
telegram
was
handed
to
him
announcing
that
his
museum
was
in
flames
with
no
hope
of
saving
any
portion
of
his
cherished
establishment
without
the
slightest
evidence
of
agitation
he
laid
the
telegram
upon
his
desk
and
finished
his
speech
when
he
went
next
day
to
new
york
he
saw
only
a
pile
of
black
smouldering
ruins
immediately
after
adjournment
that
afternoon
i
took
the
cars
for
bridgeport
spending
the
night
quietly
at
home
and
the
following
morning
i
went
to
new
york
to
see
the
ruins
of
my
museum
and
to
learn
the
full
extent
of
the
disaster
when
i
arrived
at
the
scene
of
the
calamity
and
saw
nothing
but
the
smouldering
debris
of
what
a
few
hours
before
was
the
american
museum
the
sight
was
sad
indeed
here
were
destroyed
almost
in
a
breath
the
accumulated
results
of
many
years
of
incessant
toil
my
own
and
my
predecessors
in
gathering
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
myriads
of
curious
productions
of
nature
and
art
an
assemblage
of
rarities
which
a
half
million
of
dollars
could
not
restore
and
a
quarter
of
a
century
could
not
collect
in
addition
to
these
there
were
many
revolutionary
relics
and
other
links
in
our
national
history
which
never
could
be
duplicated
not
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
the
entire
property
was
saved
the
destruction
was
complete
the
loss
was
irreparable
and
the
total
amount
of
insurance
was
but
forty
thousand
dollars
the
fire
probably
originated
in
the
engine
room
where
steam
was
constantly
kept
up
to
pump
fresh
air
into
the
water
of
the
aquaria
and
to
propel
the
immense
fans
for
cooling
the
atmosphere
of
the
halls
the
flames
burst
through
into
the
manager
s
office
and
rapidly
extended
to
all
parts
of
the
building
the
desk
of
my
hurd
was
already
in
flames
when
he
opened
it
and
took
out
several
thousands
of
dollars
in
bank
bills
and
reflecting
upon
the
risk
he
might
incur
in
carrying
it
through
the
surging
crowd
outside
with
remarkable
presence
of
mind
and
faith
in
herring
s
safes
he
hastily
thrust
this
money
with
the
account
books
into
my
safe
which
already
held
many
thousand
dollars
and
locking
the
door
left
the
whole
with
entire
confidence
to
the
flames
buttoning
his
coat
he
safely
made
his
way
out
of
the
burning
building
and
through
the
excited
throng
in
the
streets
hurd
s
faith
in
herring
was
well
founded
for
when
the
safe
was
recovered
from
the
ruins
its
contents
were
discovered
to
be
in
perfect
preservation
of
the
curiosities
and
other
contents
of
the
establishment
nothing
was
saved
when
i
first
gazed
upon
the
ruins
i
saw
down
in
the
depths
the
remains
of
the
two
white
whales
which
had
arrived
only
a
week
before
and
which
were
swimming
in
the
great
glass
tank
when
the
fire
broke
out
i
had
never
seen
these
monsters
alive
but
the
carcasses
presented
to
my
mind
the
worst
specimens
of
baked
and
boiled
fish
that
could
be
conceived
of
all
the
new
york
newspapers
made
a
great
sensation
of
the
fire
and
the
full
particulars
were
copied
in
journals
throughout
the
country
a
facetious
reporter
nathan
urner
of
the
wrote
the
following
amusing
account
which
appeared
in
that
journal
july
and
was
very
generally
quoted
from
and
copied
by
provincial
papers
many
of
whose
readers
accepted
every
line
of
the
glowing
narrative
as
gospel
truth
soon
after
the
breaking
out
of
the
conflagration
a
number
of
strange
and
terrible
howls
and
moans
proceeding
from
the
large
apartment
in
the
third
floor
of
the
museum
corner
of
ann
street
and
broadway
startled
the
throngs
who
had
collected
in
front
of
the
burning
building
and
who
were
at
first
under
the
impression
that
the
sounds
must
proceed
from
human
beings
unable
to
effect
their
escape
their
anxiety
was
somewhat
relieved
on
this
score
but
their
consternation
was
by
no
means
decreased
upon
learning
that
the
room
in
question
was
the
principal
chamber
of
the
menagerie
connected
with
the
museum
and
that
there
was
imminent
danger
of
the
release
of
the
animals
there
confined
by
the
action
of
the
flames
our
reporter
fortunately
occupied
a
room
on
the
north
corner
of
ann
street
and
broadway
the
windows
of
which
looked
immediately
into
this
apartment
and
no
sooner
was
he
apprised
of
the
fire
than
he
repaired
there
confident
of
finding
items
in
abundance
luckily
the
windows
of
the
museum
were
unclosed
and
he
had
a
perfect
view
of
almost
the
entire
interior
of
the
apartment
the
following
is
his
statement
of
what
followed
in
his
own
language
protecting
myself
from
the
intense
heat
as
well
as
i
could
by
taking
the
mattress
from
the
bed
and
erecting
it
as
a
bulwark
before
the
window
with
only
enough
space
reserved
on
the
top
so
as
to
look
out
i
anxiously
observed
the
animals
in
the
opposite
room
immediately
opposite
the
window
through
which
i
gazed
was
a
large
cage
containing
a
lion
and
lioness
to
the
right
hand
was
the
three
storied
cage
containing
monkeys
at
the
top
two
kangaroos
in
the
second
story
and
a
happy
family
of
cats
rats
adders
rabbits
in
the
lower
apartment
to
the
left
of
the
lion
s
cage
was
the
tank
containing
the
two
vast
alligators
and
still
further
to
the
left
partially
hidden
from
my
sight
was
the
grand
tank
containing
the
great
white
whale
which
has
created
such
a
furore
in
our
midst
for
the
past
few
weeks
upon
the
floor
were
caged
the
anacondas
and
rattlesnakes
whose
heads
would
now
and
then
rise
menacingly
through
the
top
of
the
cage
in
the
extreme
right
was
the
cage
entirely
shut
from
my
view
at
first
containing
the
bengal
tiger
and
the
polar
bear
whose
terrific
growls
could
be
distinctly
heard
from
behind
the
partition
with
a
simultaneous
bound
the
lion
and
his
mate
sprang
against
the
bars
which
gave
way
and
came
down
with
a
great
crash
releasing
the
beasts
which
for
a
moment
apparently
amazed
at
their
sudden
liberty
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
lashing
their
sides
with
their
tails
and
roaring
dolefully
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
upper
part
of
the
three
storied
cage
consumed
by
the
flames
fell
forward
letting
the
rods
drop
to
the
floor
and
many
other
animals
were
set
free
just
at
this
time
the
door
fell
through
and
the
flames
and
smoke
rolled
in
like
a
whirlwind
from
the
hadean
river
cocytus
a
horrible
scene
in
the
right
hand
corner
of
the
room
a
yell
of
indescribable
agony
and
a
crashing
grating
sound
indicated
that
the
tiger
and
polar
bear
were
stirred
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
then
there
came
a
great
crash
as
of
the
giving
way
of
the
bars
of
their
cage
the
flames
and
smoke
momentarily
rolled
back
and
for
a
few
seconds
the
interior
of
the
room
was
visible
in
the
lurid
light
of
the
flames
which
revealed
the
tiger
and
the
lion
locked
together
in
close
combat
the
monkeys
were
perched
around
the
windows
shivering
with
dread
and
afraid
to
jump
out
the
snakes
were
writhing
about
crippled
and
blistered
by
the
heat
darting
out
their
forked
tongues
and
expressing
their
rage
and
fear
in
the
most
sibilant
of
hisses
the
happy
family
were
experiencing
an
amount
of
beatitude
which
was
evidently
too
cordial
for
philosophical
enjoyment
a
long
tongue
of
flame
had
crept
under
the
cage
completely
singing
every
hair
from
the
cat
s
body
the
felicitous
adder
was
slowly
burning
in
two
and
busily
engaged
in
impregnating
his
organic
system
with
his
own
venom
the
joyful
rat
had
lost
his
tail
by
a
falling
bar
of
iron
and
the
beatific
rabbit
perforated
by
a
red
hot
nail
looked
as
if
nothing
would
be
more
grateful
than
a
cool
corner
in
some
esquimaux
farmyard
the
members
of
the
delectated
convocation
were
all
huddled
together
in
the
bottom
of
their
cage
which
suddenly
gave
way
precipitating
them
out
of
view
in
the
depths
below
which
by
this
time
were
also
blazing
like
the
fabled
tophet
at
this
moment
the
flames
rolled
again
into
the
room
and
then
again
retired
the
whale
and
alligators
were
by
this
time
suffering
dreadful
torments
the
water
in
which
they
swam
was
literally
boiling
the
alligators
dashed
fiercely
about
endeavoring
to
escape
and
opening
and
shutting
their
great
jaws
in
ferocious
torture
but
the
poor
whale
almost
boiled
with
great
ulcers
bursting
from
his
blubbery
sides
could
only
feebly
swim
about
though
blowing
excessively
and
every
now
and
then
sending
up
great
fountains
of
spray
at
length
crack
went
the
glass
sides
of
the
great
cases
and
whale
and
alligators
rolled
out
on
the
floor
with
the
rushing
and
steaming
water
the
whale
died
easily
having
been
pretty
well
used
up
before
a
few
great
gasps
and
a
convulsive
flap
or
two
of
his
mighty
flukes
were
his
expiring
spasm
one
of
the
alligators
was
killed
almost
immediately
by
falling
across
a
great
fragment
of
shattered
glass
which
cut
open
his
stomach
and
let
out
the
greater
part
of
his
entrails
to
the
light
of
day
the
remaining
alligator
became
involved
in
a
controversy
with
an
anaconda
and
joined
the
melee
in
the
centre
of
the
flaming
apartment
a
number
of
birds
which
were
caged
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
were
set
free
by
some
charitably
inclined
person
at
the
first
alarm
of
fire
and
at
intervals
they
flew
out
there
were
many
valuable
tropical
birds
parrots
cockatoos
mocking
birds
humming
birds
as
well
as
some
vultures
and
eagles
and
one
condor
great
excitement
existed
among
the
swaying
crowds
in
the
streets
below
as
they
took
wing
there
were
confined
in
the
same
room
a
few
serpents
which
also
obtained
their
liberty
and
soon
after
the
rising
and
devouring
flames
began
to
enwrap
the
entire
building
a
splendid
and
emblematic
sight
was
presented
to
the
wondering
and
upgazing
throngs
bursting
through
the
central
casement
with
flap
of
wings
and
lashing
coils
appeared
an
eagle
and
a
serpent
wreathed
in
fight
for
a
moment
they
hung
poised
in
mid
air
presenting
a
novel
and
terrible
conflict
it
was
the
earth
and
air
or
their
respective
representatives
at
war
for
mastery
the
base
and
the
lofty
the
groveller
and
the
soarer
were
engaged
in
deadly
battle
at
length
the
flat
head
of
the
serpent
sank
his
writhing
sinuous
form
grew
still
and
wafted
upward
by
the
cheers
of
the
gazing
multitude
the
eagle
with
a
scream
of
triumph
and
bearing
his
prey
in
his
iron
talons
soared
toward
the
sun
several
monkeys
escaped
from
the
burning
building
to
the
neighboring
roofs
and
streets
and
considerable
excitement
was
caused
by
the
attempts
to
secure
them
one
of
the
most
amusing
incidents
in
this
respect
was
in
connection
with
james
gordon
bennett
the
veteran
editor
of
the
was
sitting
in
his
private
office
with
his
back
to
the
open
window
calmly
discussing
with
a
friend
the
chances
that
the
establishment
would
escape
the
conflagration
which
at
that
time
was
threateningly
advancing
up
ann
street
toward
nassau
street
in
the
course
of
his
conversation
bennett
observed
although
i
have
usually
had
good
luck
in
cases
of
fire
they
say
that
the
devil
is
ever
at
one
s
shoulder
and
here
an
exclamation
from
his
friend
interrupted
him
and
turning
quickly
he
was
considerably
taken
aback
at
seeing
the
devil
himself
or
something
like
him
at
his
very
shoulder
as
he
spoke
recovering
his
equanimity
with
the
ease
and
suavity
which
is
usual
with
him
in
all
company
bennett
was
about
to
address
the
intruder
when
he
perceived
that
what
he
had
taken
for
the
gentleman
in
black
was
nothing
more
than
a
frightened
the
poor
creature
but
recently
released
from
captivity
and
doubtless
thinking
that
he
might
fill
some
vacancy
in
the
editorial
corps
of
the
paper
in
question
had
descended
by
the
and
instinctively
taken
refuge
in
the
inner
sanctum
of
the
establishment
although
the
editor
perhaps
from
the
fact
that
he
saw
nothing
peculiarly
strange
in
the
visitation
soon
regained
his
composure
it
was
far
otherwise
with
his
friend
who
immediately
gave
the
alarm
hudson
rushed
in
and
boldly
attacked
the
monkey
grasping
him
by
the
throat
the
next
came
in
obtaining
a
clutch
upon
the
brute
by
the
ears
the
musical
critic
followed
and
seized
the
tail
with
both
hands
and
a
number
of
reporters
armed
with
inkstands
and
sharpened
pencils
came
next
followed
by
a
dozen
policemen
with
brandished
clubs
at
the
same
time
the
engineer
in
the
basement
received
the
preconcerted
signal
and
got
ready
his
hose
wherewith
to
pour
boiling
hot
water
upon
the
heads
of
those
in
the
streets
in
case
it
should
prove
a
regular
systematized
attack
by
gorillas
brazil
apes
and
chimpanzees
opposed
to
this
formidable
combination
the
rash
intruder
fared
badly
and
was
soon
in
durance
vile
numerous
other
incidents
of
a
similar
kind
occurred
but
some
of
the
most
amusing
were
in
connection
with
the
wax
figures
upon
the
same
impulse
which
prompts
men
in
time
of
fire
to
fling
valuable
out
of
windows
and
at
the
same
time
tenderly
to
lower
down
feather
beds
soon
after
the
museum
took
fire
a
number
of
sturdy
firemen
rushed
into
the
building
to
carry
out
the
wax
figures
there
were
thousands
of
valuable
articles
which
might
have
been
saved
if
there
had
been
less
of
solicitude
displayed
for
the
miserable
effigies
which
are
usually
exhibited
under
the
appellation
of
wax
as
it
was
a
dozen
firemen
rushed
into
the
apartment
where
the
figures
were
kept
amid
a
multitude
of
crawling
snakes
chattering
monkeys
and
escaped
paroquets
the
dying
brigand
was
unceremoniously
throttled
and
dragged
toward
the
door
liberties
were
taken
with
the
tearful
senorita
who
has
so
long
knelt
and
so
constantly
wagged
her
doll
s
head
at
his
side
the
mules
of
the
other
bandits
were
upset
and
they
themselves
roughly
seized
the
full
length
statue
of
barnum
fell
down
of
its
own
accord
as
if
disgusted
with
the
whole
affair
a
fireman
seized
with
either
hand
franklin
pierce
and
james
buchanan
by
their
tucked
the
prince
imperial
of
france
under
one
arm
and
the
veiled
murderess
under
the
other
and
coolly
departed
for
the
street
two
ragged
boys
quarrelled
over
the
tom
thumb
but
at
length
settled
the
controversy
by
one
of
them
taking
the
head
the
other
satisfying
himself
with
the
legs
below
the
knees
they
evidently
had
tom
under
their
thumbs
and
intended
to
keep
him
down
while
a
policeman
was
garroting
benjamin
franklin
with
the
idea
of
abducting
him
a
small
monkey
flung
from
the
by
the
strong
hand
of
an
impatient
fireman
made
a
straight
dive
hitting
poor
richard
just
below
the
waistcoat
and
passing
through
his
stomach
as
the
harlequin
in
the
pantomime
ever
pierced
the
picture
with
the
slit
in
it
which
always
hangs
so
conveniently
low
and
near
patrick
henry
had
his
teeth
knocked
out
by
a
flying
missile
and
in
carrying
daniel
lambert
down
stairs
he
was
found
to
be
so
large
that
they
had
to
break
off
his
head
in
order
to
get
him
through
the
door
at
length
the
heat
became
intense
the
figgers
began
to
perspire
freely
and
the
swiftly
approaching
flames
compelled
all
hands
to
desist
from
any
further
attempt
at
rescue
throwing
a
parting
glance
behind
as
we
passed
down
the
stairs
we
saw
the
remaining
dignitaries
in
a
strange
plight
some
one
had
stuck
a
cigar
in
general
washington
s
mouth
and
thus
with
his
chapeau
crushed
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
head
reclining
upon
the
ample
lap
of
moll
pitcher
the
father
of
his
country
led
the
van
of
as
sorry
a
band
of
patriots
as
not
often
comes
within
one
s
experience
to
see
general
marion
was
playing
a
dummy
game
of
poker
with
general
lafayette
governor
morris
was
having
a
with
nathan
lane
and
james
madison
was
executing
a
dutch
polka
with
madam
roland
on
one
arm
and
lucretia
borgia
on
the
other
the
next
moment
the
advancing
flames
compelled
us
to
retire
we
believe
that
all
the
living
curiosities
were
saved
but
the
giant
girl
anna
swan
was
only
rescued
with
the
utmost
difficulty
there
was
not
a
door
through
which
her
bulky
frame
could
obtain
a
passage
it
was
likewise
feared
that
the
stairs
would
break
down
even
if
she
should
reach
them
her
best
friend
the
living
skeleton
stood
by
her
as
long
as
he
dared
but
then
deserted
her
while
as
the
heat
grew
in
intensity
the
perspiration
rolled
from
her
face
in
little
brooks
and
rivulets
which
pattered
musically
upon
the
floor
at
length
as
a
last
resort
the
employees
of
the
place
procured
a
lofty
derrick
which
fortunately
happened
to
be
standing
near
and
erected
it
alongside
the
museum
a
portion
of
the
wall
was
then
broken
off
on
each
side
of
the
window
the
strong
tackle
was
got
in
readiness
the
tall
woman
was
made
fast
to
one
end
and
swung
over
the
heads
of
the
people
in
the
street
with
eighteen
men
grasping
the
other
extremity
of
the
line
and
lowered
down
from
the
third
story
amid
enthusiastic
applause
a
carriage
of
extraordinary
capacity
was
in
readiness
and
entering
this
the
young
lady
was
driven
away
to
a
hotel
when
the
surviving
serpents
that
were
released
by
the
partial
burning
of
the
box
in
which
they
were
contained
crept
along
on
the
floor
to
the
balcony
of
the
museum
and
dropped
on
the
sidewalk
the
crowd
siezed
with
patrick
s
aversion
to
the
reptiles
fled
with
such
precipitate
haste
that
they
knocked
each
other
down
and
trampled
on
one
another
in
the
most
reckless
and
damaging
manner
hats
were
lost
coats
torn
boots
burst
and
pantaloons
dropped
with
magnificent
miscellaneousness
and
dozens
of
those
who
rose
from
the
miry
streets
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
looked
like
the
disembodied
spirits
of
a
mud
bank
the
snakes
crawled
on
the
sidewalk
and
into
broadway
where
some
of
them
died
from
injuries
received
and
others
were
despatched
by
the
excited
populace
several
of
the
serpents
of
the
species
escaped
the
fury
of
the
tumultuous
masses
and
true
to
their
instincts
sought
shelter
in
the
and
offices
a
large
black
bear
escaped
from
the
burning
museum
into
ann
street
and
then
made
his
way
into
nassau
and
down
that
thoroughfare
into
wall
where
his
appearance
caused
a
sensation
some
superstitious
persons
believed
him
the
spirit
of
a
departed
ursa
major
and
others
of
his
fraternity
welcomed
the
animal
as
a
favorable
omen
the
bear
walked
quietly
along
to
the
custom
house
ascended
the
steps
of
the
building
and
became
bewildered
as
many
a
biped
bear
has
done
before
him
he
seemed
to
lose
his
sense
of
vision
and
no
doubt
endeavoring
to
operate
for
a
fall
walked
over
the
side
of
the
steps
and
broke
his
neck
he
succeeded
in
his
object
but
it
cost
him
dearly
the
appearance
of
bruin
in
the
street
sensibly
affected
the
stock
market
and
shares
fell
rapidly
but
when
he
lost
his
life
in
the
careless
manner
we
have
described
shares
advanced
again
and
the
bulls
triumphed
once
more
broadway
and
its
crossings
have
not
witnessed
a
denser
throng
for
months
than
assembled
at
the
fire
yesterday
barnum
s
was
always
popular
but
it
never
drew
so
vast
a
crowd
before
there
must
have
been
forty
thousand
people
on
broadway
between
maiden
lane
and
chambers
street
and
a
great
portion
stayed
there
until
dusk
so
great
was
the
concourse
of
people
that
it
was
with
difficulty
pedestrians
or
vehicles
could
pass
after
the
fire
several
epicures
grouping
among
the
ruins
found
choice
morsels
of
boiled
whale
roasted
kangaroo
and
fricasseed
crocodile
which
it
is
said
they
relished
though
the
many
would
have
failed
to
appreciate
such
rare
edibles
probably
the
recherche
epicures
will
declare
the
only
true
way
to
prepare
those
meats
is
to
cook
them
in
a
museum
wrapped
in
flames
in
the
same
manner
that
the
chinese
according
to
charles
lamb
first
discovered
roast
pig
in
a
burning
house
and
ever
afterward
set
a
house
on
fire
with
a
pig
inside
when
they
wanted
that
particular
food
all
the
new
york
journals
and
many
more
in
other
cities
editorially
expressed
their
sympathy
with
my
misfortune
and
their
sense
of
the
loss
the
community
had
sustained
in
the
destruction
of
the
american
museum
the
following
editorial
is
from
the
york
of
july
the
destruction
of
no
building
in
this
city
could
have
caused
so
much
excitement
and
so
much
regret
as
that
of
barnum
s
museum
the
collection
of
curiosities
was
very
large
and
though
many
of
them
may
not
have
had
much
intrinsic
or
memorial
value
a
considerable
portion
was
certainly
of
great
worth
for
any
museum
but
aside
from
this
pleasant
memories
clustered
about
the
place
which
for
so
many
years
has
been
the
chief
resort
for
amusement
to
the
common
people
who
can
not
often
afford
to
treat
themselves
to
a
night
at
the
more
expensive
theatres
while
to
the
children
of
the
city
barnum
s
has
been
a
fountain
of
delight
ever
offering
new
attractions
as
captivating
and
as
implicitly
believed
in
as
the
arabian
nights
entertainments
theatre
menagerie
and
museum
it
amused
instructed
and
astonished
if
its
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
annual
visitors
were
bewildered
sometimes
with
a
woolly
horse
a
what
is
it
or
a
mermaid
they
found
repose
and
certainty
in
a
giraffe
a
whale
or
a
rhinoceros
if
wax
effigies
of
pirates
and
murderers
made
them
shudder
lest
those
dreadful
figures
should
start
out
of
their
glass
cases
and
repeat
their
horrid
deeds
they
were
reassured
by
the
presence
of
the
mildest
and
most
amiable
of
giants
and
the
fattest
of
mortal
women
whose
dead
weight
alone
could
crush
all
the
wax
figures
into
their
original
cakes
it
was
a
source
of
unfailing
interest
to
all
country
visitors
and
new
york
to
many
of
them
was
only
the
place
that
held
barnum
s
museum
it
was
the
first
thing
often
the
only
thing
they
visited
when
they
came
among
us
and
nothing
that
could
have
been
contrived
out
of
our
present
resources
could
have
offered
so
many
attractions
unless
some
more
ingenious
showman
had
undertaken
to
add
to
barnum
s
collection
of
waxen
criminals
by
putting
in
a
cage
the
live
boards
of
the
common
council
we
mourn
its
loss
but
not
as
without
consolation
barnum
s
museum
is
gone
but
barnum
himself
happily
did
not
share
the
fate
of
his
rattlesnakes
and
his
at
least
most
happy
there
are
fishes
in
the
seas
and
beasts
in
the
forest
birds
still
fly
in
the
air
and
strange
creatures
still
roam
in
the
deserts
giants
and
pigmies
still
wander
up
and
down
the
earth
the
oldest
man
the
fattest
woman
and
the
smallest
baby
are
still
living
and
barnum
will
find
them
or
even
if
none
of
these
things
or
creatures
existed
we
could
trust
to
barnum
to
make
them
out
of
hand
the
museum
then
is
only
a
temporary
loss
and
much
as
we
sympathize
with
the
proprietor
the
public
may
trust
to
his
ability
and
energy
to
soon
renew
a
place
of
amusement
which
was
a
source
of
so
much
innocent
pleasure
and
had
in
it
so
many
elements
of
solid
excellence
as
already
stated
my
insurance
was
but
while
the
collection
at
the
lowest
estimate
was
worth
and
as
my
premium
was
five
per
cent
i
had
paid
the
insurance
companies
more
than
they
returned
to
me
when
the
fire
occurred
my
summer
pantomime
season
had
just
begun
and
the
museum
was
doing
an
immensely
profitable
business
my
first
impulse
after
reckoning
up
my
losses
was
to
retire
from
active
life
and
from
all
business
occupation
beyond
what
my
large
real
estate
interests
in
bridgeport
and
my
property
in
new
york
would
compel
i
felt
that
i
had
still
a
competence
and
that
after
a
most
active
and
busy
life
at
years
i
was
entitled
to
retirement
to
comparative
rest
for
the
remainder
of
my
days
i
called
on
my
old
friend
the
editor
of
the
for
advice
on
the
subject
accept
this
fire
as
a
notice
to
quit
and
go
said
greeley
i
exclaimed
yes
i
have
been
wanting
to
go
for
thirty
years
and
have
not
yet
found
time
to
do
so
replied
greeley
i
really
felt
that
his
advice
was
good
and
wise
and
had
i
consulted
only
my
own
ease
and
interest
i
should
have
acted
upon
it
but
two
considerations
moved
me
to
pause
first
one
hundred
and
fifty
employees
many
of
whom
depended
upon
their
exertions
for
their
daily
bread
were
thrown
out
of
work
at
a
season
when
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
get
engagements
elsewhere
second
i
felt
that
a
large
city
like
new
york
needed
a
good
museum
and
that
my
experience
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
that
direction
afforded
extraordinary
facilities
for
founding
another
establishment
of
the
kind
and
so
i
took
a
few
days
for
reflection
meanwhile
the
museum
employees
were
tendered
a
benefit
at
the
academy
of
music
at
which
most
of
the
dramatic
artists
in
the
city
volunteered
their
services
i
was
called
out
and
made
some
remarks
in
which
i
stated
that
nothing
which
i
could
utter
in
behalf
of
the
recipients
of
that
benefit
could
plead
for
them
half
so
eloquently
as
the
smoking
ruins
of
the
building
where
they
had
so
long
earned
their
support
by
their
efforts
to
gratify
the
public
at
the
same
time
i
announced
that
moved
by
the
considerations
i
have
mentioned
i
had
concluded
to
establish
another
museum
and
that
in
order
to
give
present
occupation
to
my
employees
i
had
engaged
the
winter
garden
theatre
for
a
few
weeks
and
i
hoped
to
open
a
new
establishment
of
my
own
in
the
ensuing
fall
the
york
commented
upon
the
few
remarks
which
i
was
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
called
upon
to
make
in
the
following
flattering
manner
one
of
the
happiest
impromptu
oratorial
efforts
that
we
have
heard
for
some
time
was
that
made
by
barnum
at
the
benefit
performance
given
for
his
employees
on
friday
afternoon
if
a
stranger
wanted
to
satisfy
himself
how
the
great
showman
had
managed
so
to
monopolize
the
ear
and
eye
of
the
public
during
his
long
career
he
could
not
have
had
a
better
opportunity
of
doing
so
than
by
listening
to
this
address
every
word
though
delivered
with
apparent
carelessness
struck
a
key
note
in
the
hearts
of
his
listeners
simple
forcible
and
touching
it
showed
how
thoroughly
this
extraordinary
man
comprehends
the
character
of
his
countrymen
and
how
easily
he
can
play
upon
their
feelings
those
who
look
upon
barnum
as
a
mere
charlatan
have
really
no
knowledge
of
him
it
would
be
easy
to
demonstrate
that
the
qualities
that
have
placed
him
in
his
present
position
of
notoriety
and
affluence
would
in
another
pursuit
have
raised
him
to
far
greater
eminence
in
his
breadth
of
views
his
profound
knowledge
of
mankind
his
courage
under
reverses
his
indomitable
perseverance
his
ready
eloquence
and
his
admirable
business
tact
we
recognize
the
elements
that
are
conducive
to
success
in
most
other
pursuits
more
than
almost
any
other
living
man
barnum
may
be
said
to
be
a
representative
type
of
the
american
mind
i
very
soon
secured
by
lease
the
premises
numbers
and
broadway
feet
front
and
rear
by
two
hundred
feet
deep
and
known
as
the
chinese
museum
buildings
in
less
than
four
months
i
succeeded
in
converting
this
building
into
a
commodious
museum
and
lecture
room
and
meanwhile
i
sent
agents
through
america
and
europe
to
purchase
curiosities
besides
hundreds
of
small
collections
i
bought
up
several
entire
museums
and
with
many
living
curiosities
and
my
old
company
of
actors
and
actresses
i
opened
to
the
public
november
barnum
s
new
american
museum
thus
beginning
a
new

during

in

of
i
made
several
new
friends
and
agreeable
acquaintances
and
many
things
occurred
sometimes
in
the
regular
proceedings
and
sometimes
as
episodes
which
made
the
session
memorable
on
one
occasion
a
representative
who
was
a
lawyer
introduced
resolutions
to
reduce
the
number
of
representatives
urging
that
the
house
was
too
large
and
ponderous
a
body
to
work
smoothly
that
a
smaller
number
of
persons
could
accomplish
business
more
rapidly
and
completely
and
in
fact
that
the
connecticut
legislature
was
so
large
that
the
members
did
not
have
time
to
get
acquainted
with
each
other
before
the
body
adjourned
i
replied
that
the
larger
the
number
of
representatives
the
more
difficult
it
would
be
to
tamper
with
them
and
if
they
all
could
not
become
personally
acquainted
so
much
the
better
for
there
would
be
fewer
rings
and
less
facilities
for
forcing
improper
legislation
as
the
house
seems
to
be
thin
now
i
will
move
to
lay
my
resolutions
on
the
table
remarked
the
member
but
i
shall
call
them
up
when
there
is
a
full
according
to
the
gentleman
s
own
theory
i
replied
the
smaller
the
number
the
surer
are
we
to
arrive
at
correct
conclusions
now
therefore
is
just
the
time
to
decide
and
i
move
that
the
gentleman
s
resolutions
be
this
proposition
was
seconded
amid
a
roar
of
laughter
and
the
resolutions
were
almost
unanimously
voted
down
before
the
member
fairly
comprehended
what
was
going
on
he
afterwards
acknowledged
it
as
a
pretty
fair
joke
and
at
any
rate
as
an
effective
one
the
state
house
at
hartford
was
a
disgrace
to
connecticut
the
hall
of
representatives
was
too
small
there
were
no
committee
rooms
and
the
building
was
utterly
unfit
for
the
purposes
to
which
it
was
devoted
the
state
house
at
new
haven
was
very
little
better
and
i
made
a
strong
effort
to
secure
the
erection
of
new
edifices
in
both
cities
i
was
chairman
of
the
committee
on
new
state
houses
and
during
our
investigations
it
was
ascertained
that
bridgeport
middletown
and
meriden
would
each
be
willing
to
erect
a
state
house
at
its
own
cost
if
the
city
should
be
selected
as
the
new
capital
of
the
state
these
movements
aroused
the
jealousy
of
hartford
and
new
haven
which
at
once
appointed
committees
to
wait
upon
us
the
whole
matter
however
finally
went
by
default
and
the
question
was
never
submitted
to
the
people
it
is
quite
possible
however
that
ere
long
the
citizens
of
bridgeport
or
meriden
will
offer
to
build
a
capitol
and
that
one
of
these
two
cities
with
the
entire
consent
of
the
rest
of
the
state
including
the
inhabitants
of
hartford
and
new
haven
will
become
the
capital
of
connecticut
as
the
session
drew
near
its
close
the
railroad
controversy
culminated
by
my
introduction
of
a
bill
to
amend
the
act
for
the
regulation
of
railroads
by
the
interpolation
of
the
following
section
no
railroad
company
which
has
had
a
system
of
commutation
fares
in
force
for
more
than
four
years
shall
abolish
alter
or
modify
the
same
except
for
the
regulation
of
the
price
charged
for
such
commutation
and
such
price
shall
in
no
case
be
raised
to
an
extent
that
shall
alter
the
ratio
between
such
commutation
and
the
rates
then
charged
for
way
fare
on
the
railroad
of
such
company
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
company
seemed
determined
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
prevent
the
passage
of
this
law
the
halls
of
legislation
were
thronged
with
railroad
lobbyists
who
nearly
every
member
my
motives
were
attacked
and
the
most
foolish
slanders
were
circulated
not
only
every
legal
man
in
the
house
was
arrayed
against
me
but
occasionally
a
country
member
who
had
promised
to
stick
by
and
aid
in
checking
the
cupidity
of
railroad
managers
would
drop
off
and
be
found
voting
on
the
other
side
i
devoted
many
hours
and
even
days
to
explaining
the
true
state
of
things
to
the
members
from
the
rural
regions
and
although
the
prospect
of
carrying
this
great
reform
looked
rather
dark
i
felt
that
i
had
a
majority
of
the
honest
and
disinterested
members
of
the
house
with
me
finally
senator
ballard
informed
me
that
he
had
canvassed
the
senate
and
was
convinced
that
the
bill
could
be
carried
through
that
body
if
i
could
be
equally
successful
with
the
house
at
last
it
was
known
that
the
final
debate
would
take
place
and
the
vote
be
taken
on
the
morning
of
july
when
the
day
arrived
the
excitement
was
intense
the
passages
leading
to
the
hall
were
crowded
with
railroad
lobbyists
for
nearly
every
railroad
in
the
state
had
made
common
cause
with
the
new
york
and
new
haven
company
and
every
representative
was
in
his
seat
excepting
the
sick
man
who
had
doctored
the
railroads
till
he
needed
doctoring
himself
the
debate
was
led
off
by
skirmishers
on
each
side
and
was
finally
closed
on
the
part
of
the
railroads
by
harrison
of
new
haven
who
was
chairman
of
the
railroad
committee
henry
harrison
was
a
close
and
forcible
debater
and
a
lawyer
his
speech
exhibited
considerable
thought
and
his
earnestness
and
high
character
as
a
gentleman
of
honor
carried
much
weight
besides
his
position
as
chairman
of
the
committee
naturally
influenced
some
votes
he
claimed
to
understand
thoroughly
the
merits
of
the
question
from
having
in
his
capacity
as
chairman
heard
all
the
testimony
and
arguments
which
had
come
before
that
committee
and
a
majority
of
the
committee
after
due
deliberation
had
reported
against
the
proposed
bill
on
closing
the
debate
i
endeavored
to
state
briefly
the
gist
of
the
case
that
only
a
few
years
before
the
new
york
and
new
haven
company
had
fixed
their
own
price
for
commuters
tickets
along
the
whole
line
of
the
road
and
had
thus
induced
hundreds
of
new
york
citizens
to
remove
to
connecticut
with
their
families
and
build
their
houses
on
heretofore
unimproved
property
thus
vastly
increasing
the
value
of
the
lands
and
correspondingly
helping
our
receipts
for
taxes
i
urged
that
there
was
a
tacit
understanding
between
the
railroad
and
these
commuters
and
the
public
generally
that
such
persons
as
chose
thus
to
remove
from
a
neighboring
state
and
bring
their
families
and
capital
within
our
borders
should
have
the
right
to
pass
over
the
railroad
on
the
terms
fixed
at
the
time
by
the
president
and
directors
that
any
claim
that
the
railroad
could
not
afford
to
commute
at
the
prices
they
had
themselves
established
was
absurd
from
the
fact
that
even
now
if
one
thousand
families
who
reside
in
new
york
and
had
never
been
in
our
own
state
should
propose
to
the
railroad
to
remove
these
families
embracing
in
the
aggregate
five
thousand
persons
to
connecticut
and
build
one
thousand
new
houses
on
the
line
of
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
provided
the
railroad
would
carry
the
male
head
of
the
family
at
all
times
for
nothing
the
company
could
well
afford
to
accept
the
proposition
because
they
would
receive
full
prices
for
transporting
all
other
members
of
these
families
at
all
times
as
well
as
full
prices
for
all
their
visitors
and
servants
and
now
what
are
the
facts
do
we
desire
the
railroad
to
carry
even
of
these
new
comers
for
nothing
do
we
indeed
desire
to
compel
them
to
transport
them
for
any
definitely
fixed
price
at
all
on
the
contrary
we
find
that
during
the
late
rebellion
when
gold
was
selling
for
two
dollars
and
eighty
cents
per
dollar
this
company
doubled
its
prices
of
commutation
and
retains
the
same
prices
now
although
gold
is
but
one
half
that
amount
we
don
t
ask
them
to
go
back
to
their
former
prices
we
don
t
compel
them
to
rest
even
here
we
simply
say
increase
your
rates
pile
up
your
demands
just
as
high
as
you
desire
only
you
shall
not
make
fish
of
one
and
fowl
of
another
you
have
fixed
and
increased
your
prices
to
passengers
of
all
classes
just
as
you
liked
and
established
your
own
ratio
between
those
who
pay
by
the
year
and
those
who
pay
by
the
single
trip
and
now
all
we
ask
is
that
you
shall
not
change
the
ratio
charge
ten
dollars
per
passenger
from
new
york
to
new
haven
if
you
have
the
courage
to
risk
the
competition
of
the
steamboats
and
whatever
percentage
you
choose
to
increase
the
fare
of
transient
passengers
we
permit
you
to
increase
the
rates
of
commuters
in
the
same
ratio
the
interests
of
the
state
as
well
as
commuters
demand
this
law
for
if
it
is
once
fixed
by
statute
that
the
prices
of
commutation
are
not
to
be
increased
many
persons
will
leave
the
localities
where
extortion
is
permitted
on
the
railroads
and
will
settle
in
our
state
but
these
railroad
gentlemen
say
they
have
no
intention
to
increase
their
rates
of
commutation
and
they
deprecate
what
they
term
premature
legislation
and
an
uncalled
for
meddling
with
their
affairs
speaker
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a
pound
of
men
engaged
in
plots
against
public
interests
always
ask
to
be
let
jeff
davis
only
asked
to
be
let
alone
when
the
north
was
raising
great
armies
to
prevent
the
dissolution
of
the
union
the
people
can
not
afford
to
let
these
railroads
alone
this
hall
crowded
with
railroad
lobbyists
as
the
frogs
thronged
egypt
is
an
admonition
to
all
honest
legislators
that
it
is
unsafe
to
allow
the
monopolies
the
chance
to
rivet
the
chains
which
already
fetter
the
limbs
of
those
whom
circumstances
place
in
the
power
of
these
companies
it
was
at
this
point
in
my
remarks
when
i
received
the
telegram
from
my
in
new
york
announcing
the
burning
of
the
american
museum
reading
the
despatch
and
laying
it
on
my
desk
without
further
attention
i
continued
these
railroad
gentlemen
absolutely
deny
any
intention
of
raising
the
fares
of
commuters
and
profess
to
think
it
very
hard
that
disinterested
and
conscientious
gentlemen
like
them
should
be
judged
by
the
doings
of
the
hudson
river
and
harlem
railroads
but
now
mr
speaker
i
am
going
to
expose
the
duplicity
of
these
men
i
have
had
detectives
on
their
track
for
men
who
plot
against
public
interests
deserve
to
be
watched
i
have
in
my
pocket
positive
proofs
that
they
did
and
do
intend
to
spring
their
trap
upon
the
unprotected
commuters
on
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
i
then
drew
from
my
pocket
and
read
two
telegrams
received
that
morning
one
from
new
york
and
the
other
from
bridgeport
announcing
that
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
directory
had
held
a
secret
meeting
in
new
york
the
day
before
for
the
purpose
of
immediately
raising
the
fares
of
commuters
twenty
per
cent
so
that
in
case
my
bill
became
a
law
they
could
get
ahead
of
me
i
continued
now
speaker
i
know
that
these
despatches
are
true
my
information
is
from
the
inside
of
the
camp
i
see
a
director
of
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
sitting
in
this
hall
i
know
that
he
knows
these
despatches
are
true
and
if
he
will
go
before
the
railroad
committee
and
make
oath
that
he
don
t
know
that
such
a
meeting
took
place
yesterday
for
exactly
this
purpose
i
will
forfeit
and
pay
one
thousand
dollars
to
the
families
of
poor
soldiers
in
this
city
in
consideration
of
this
attempt
to
forestall
the
action
of
this
legislature
i
offer
an
amendment
to
the
bill
now
under
consideration
by
adding
after
the
word
ratio
the
words
as
it
existed
on
the
first
day
of
july
in
this
way
we
shall
cut
off
any
action
which
these
sleek
gentlemen
may
have
taken
yesterday
it
is
now
evident
that
these
railroad
gentlemen
have
set
a
trap
for
this
legislature
and
i
propose
that
we
now
spring
the
trap
and
see
if
we
can
not
catch
these
wily
railroad
directors
in
it
speaker
i
move
the
previous
question
the
opposition
were
astounded
at
the
revelation
and
the
previous
question
was
ordered
the
bill
as
amended
was
carried
almost
with
a
it
is
now
an
act
in
the
statute
book
of
the
state
and
it
annually
adds
many
dollars
to
the
assessment
roll
of
connecticut
since
the
protection
afforded
to
commuters
against
the
extortions
practised
by
railway
companies
elsewhere
is
a
strong
inducement
to
permanent
settlers
along
the
lines
of
connecticut
railways
c
c
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
company
never
forgave
me
for
thus
securing
a
righteous
law
for
the
protection
of
its
commuters
even
as
lately
as
the
venders
of
books
on
the
trains
were
prohibited
from
selling
to
passengers
this
book
which
exposes
their
cupidity
a
parallel
railroad
from
new
york
to
new
haven
would
be
good
paying
stock
and
would
materially
disturb
if
not
destroy
the
present
railroad
and
express
monopolies
in
the
spring
of
i
was
again
elected
to
represent
the
town
of
fairfield
in
the
connecticut
legislature
i
had
not
intended
to
accept
a
nomination
for
that
office
a
second
time
but
one
of
the
directors
of
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
who
was
a
citizen
of
fairfield
and
had
been
a
zealous
lobby
member
of
the
preceding
legislature
had
declared
that
i
should
not
represent
the
town
again
as
the
voters
of
fairfield
seemed
to
think
that
the
public
interests
were
of
more
importance
than
the
success
of
railroad
conspiracies
combinations
and
monopolies
i
accepted
their
nomination
almost
the
only
exciting
question
before
that
legislature
was
the
election
of
an
united
states
senator
president
johnson
had
begun
to
show
disaffection
towards
the
republican
party
which
elected
him
and
the
zealous
members
of
that
party
were
watching
with
anxious
hearts
the
actions
of
those
who
offered
themselves
as
candidates
for
offices
of
trust
and
responsibility
one
of
the
republican
united
states
senators
had
already
abandoned
the
party
and
affiliated
with
johnson
the
other
senator
was
a
candidate
for
he
had
been
a
favorite
candidate
with
me
but
when
i
became
convinced
that
he
sympathized
with
the
recreant
senator
and
president
johnson
no
importunities
of
political
friends
or
any
other
inducement
could
change
my
determination
to
defeat
him
if
possible
i
devoted
days
and
nights
to
convincing
some
of
my
fellow
numbers
that
the
interests
of
the
state
and
the
country
demanded
the
election
of
hon
ferry
to
that
important
office
excitement
ran
high
wm
buckingham
was
also
a
candidate
i
knew
he
would
make
an
excellent
senator
but
he
had
filled
the
gubernatorial
chair
for
eight
years
and
as
the
present
senator
had
held
his
office
twelve
years
and
he
was
from
the
same
city
as
governor
buckingham
i
urged
that
norwich
should
not
carry
off
all
the
honors
that
fairfield
county
was
entitled
to
the
office
and
both
before
and
at
the
republican
nominating
caucus
i
set
forth
so
far
as
i
was
able
what
i
considered
the
merits
and
peculiar
claims
of
mr
ferry
i
suggested
that
buckingham
might
rest
on
his
laurels
for
a
couple
of
years
and
be
elected
to
fill
the
place
of
the
next
retiring
senator
in
mr
ferry
started
in
the
ballotings
with
a
very
small
vote
indeed
and
it
required
the
most
delicate
management
to
secure
a
majority
for
him
in
that
caucus
but
it
was
done
and
as
the
great
strife
was
between
the
two
other
rival
candidates
mr
ferry
had
scarcely
a
hope
of
the
nomination
and
was
much
surprised
the
next
morning
to
hear
of
his
success
he
was
elected
for
the
term
beginning
march
and
one
of
his
opposing
candidates
in
the
caucus
william
buckingham
was
elected
two
years
afterwards
for
the
senatorial
term
commencing
march
i
was
again
chairman
of
the
committee
on
agriculture
and
on
the
whole
the
session
at
new
haven
in
was
very
agreeable
to
me
there
were
many
congenial
spirits
in
the
house
and
our
severer
labors
were
lightened
by
some
very
delightful
episodes
during
the
summer
governor
hawley
hon
david
gallup
speaker
of
the

of

a

editor
of

pratt
of

wales
of
the
david

of
hartford
byington
of
norwalk
and
many
other
gentlemen
of
distinction
were
occasional
guests
at
lindencroft
several
times
we
had
delightful
sails
dinners
and
at
charles
island
eight
miles
east
of
bridgeport
a
most
cool
and
charming
spot
in
the
warm
summer
days
the
health
of
my
wife
which
had
been
poor
since
prevented
many
occasions
of
festivity
for
which
i
had
all
other
facilities
for
lindencroft
was
indeed
a
charming
residence
and
it
afforded
every
requisite
for
the
entertainment
of
large
numbers
of
friends
during
the
summer
governor
hawley
appointed
me
a
commissioner
to
the
paris
exposition
but
i
was
unable
to
attend
in
the
spring
of
i
received
from
the
republican
convention
in
the
fourth
district
in
connecticut
the
nomination
for
congress
as
i
have
already
remarked
politics
were
always
distasteful
to
me
i
possess
naturally
too
much
independence
of
mind
and
too
strong
a
determination
to
do
what
i
believe
to
be
right
regardless
of
party
expediency
to
make
a
lithe
and
oily
politician
to
be
called
on
to
favor
applications
from
without
regard
to
their
merits
and
to
do
the
dirty
work
too
often
demanded
by
political
parties
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
though
not
in
the
apostolic
sense
to
shake
hands
with
those
whom
i
despised
and
to
kiss
the
dirty
babies
of
those
whose
votes
were
courted
were
political
requirements
which
i
felt
i
could
never
acceptably
fulfil
nevertheless
i
had
become
so
far
as
business
was
concerned
almost
a
man
of
leisure
and
some
of
my
warmest
personal
friends
insisted
that
a
nomination
to
so
high
and
honorable
a
position
as
a
member
of
congress
was
not
to
be
lightly
rejected
and
so
i
consented
to
run
fairfield
and
litchfield
counties
composed
the
district
which
in
the
preceding
congressional
election
in
and
just
after
the
close
of
the
war
was
republican
in
the
year
following
however
the
district
in
state
election
went
democratic
although
the
republican
state
ticket
was
elected
i
had
this
democratic
majority
to
contend
against
in
and
as
the
whole
state
turned
over
and
elected
the
democratic
ticket
i
lost
my
election
in
the
next
succeeding
congressional
election
in
the
fourth
district
also
elected
the
only
democratic
congressman
chosen
from
connecticut
that
year
although
the
state
itself
was
republican
again
by
a
considerable
majority
i
was
neither
disappointed
nor
cast
down
by
my
defeat
the
political
canvass
served
the
purpose
of
giving
me
a
new
sensation
and
introducing
me
to
new
phases
of
human
nature
a
subject
which
i
had
always
great
delight
in
studying
the
filth
and
scandal
the
slanders
and
vindictiveness
the
plottings
and
fawnings
the
fidelity
treachery
meanness
and
manliness
which
by
turns
exhibited
themselves
in
the
exciting
scenes
preceding
the
election
were
novel
to
me
and
were
so
far
interesting
my
personal
efforts
in
the
canvass
were
mainly
confined
to
the
circulation
of
documents
and
i
did
not
spend
a
dollar
to
purchase
a
vote
shortly
after
my
opponent
was
nominated
i
sent
him
the
following
letter
which
was
also
published
in
the
bridgeport
bridgeport
barnum
salisbury

whether

shall
represent
their
interests
and
their
principles
in
the
fortieth
congress
of
the
united
states
the
theory
of
our
government
is
that
the
will
of
the
people
shall
be
the
law
of
the
land
it
is
important
therefore
that
the
people
shall
vote
understandingly
and
especially
at
this
important
crisis
in
our
national
existence
in
order
that
the
voters
of
this
district
shall
fully
comprehend
the
principles
by
which
each
of
their
congressional
candidates
is
guided
i
respectfully
invite
you
to
meet
me
in
a
serious
and
candid
discussion
of

political
issues

towns
in
the
fourth
congressional
district
of
connecticut

thus
meet
me
in
a
friendly
discussion
of
those
subjects
now
so
near
and
dear
to
every
american
heart
and
i
may
add
possessing
at
this
time
such
momentous
interest
to
all
civilized
nations
in
the
world
who
are
suffering
from
misrule
i
pledge
myself
to
conduct
my
portion
of
the
debate
with
perfect
fairness
and
with
all
due
respect
for
my
opponent
and
doubt
not
you
will
do
the
same
never
in
my
judgment
in
our
past
history
as
a
nation
have
interests
and
questions
more
important
appealed
to
the
people
for
their
wise
and
careful
consideration
it
is
due
to
the
voters
of
the
fourth
congressional
district
that
they
have
an
early
and
full
opportunity
to
examine
their
candidates
in
regard
to
these
important
problems
and
i
shall
esteem
it
a
great
privilege
if
you
will
accept
this
proposition
please
favor
me
with
an
early
answer
and
oblige
truly
yours
barnum

this
letter
william

replied
declining
to
accept
my
proposition
to
go
before
the
people
of
the
district
and
discuss
the
political
questions
of
the
day
during
the
canvass
i
received
the
following
letter

together
with
my
reply
was
published
in

was
entitled
to
the
nomination
of

candidate
for

from

fourth
district

under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
have
been
given
to
william
taylor
of
danbury
you
are
perhaps
aware
that
they
have
changed
their
tactics
and
nominated
a
wealthy
namesake
of
yours
simply
for
the
purpose
of
using
his
money
against
you
a
democratic

said
to
be
preparing
a
tariff
of
prices
to
be
paid
for
votes
and
they
boast
that
their
candidate
will
expend
to
secure
his
election
already
i
am
credibly
informed
the
greenbacks
are
being
freely
circulated
by
his
friends
i
write
to
ask
what
your
intentions
are
in
regard
to
counteracting
this
effort
of
the
copperhead
party
do
you
intend
to
fight
fire
with
fire
the
day
of

is
fast
approaching
and
we
are
confident
of
success
as
all
our

awake
respectfully

the

commenting
upon
the
correspondence
said
barnum
union
candidate
for
congress
in
the
fourth
district
of
connecticut
was
lately
solicited
by
a
friend
to
spend
money
in
a
manner
deemed
objectionable
by
barnum
and
he
responded
as
became
a
patriot
the
following
was
my
reply
to
the
above
letter
bridgeport
your
kind
letter
of
the
inst
has
caused
me
painful
emotions
i
now
wish
to
say
once
for
all
that
under
no
conceivable
circumstances
will
i
permit
a
dollar
of
mine
to
be
used
to
purchase
a
vote
or
to
induce
a
voter
to
act
contrary
to
his
honest
convictions
the
idea
that
the
intelligent
reading
men
of
new
england
can
be
bought
like
sheep
in
the
shambles
and
that
the
sacred
principles
which
have
so
far
guided
them
in
the
terrible
struggle
between
liberty
and
slavery
can
now
in
this
eventful
hour
of
national
existence
be
set
up
at
auction
and
knocked
down
to
the
highest
bidder
seems
to
me
as
preposterous
as
it
is
shameful
and
humiliating
but
if
it
is
possible
that
occasionally
a
degraded
voter
can
thus
be
induced
to
sell
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
god
grant
that
i
may
be
a
thousand
times
defeated
sooner
than
permit
one
grain
of
gold
to
be
accursed
by
using
it
so
basely
i
will
not
believe
that
american
citizens
can
lend
themselves
to
the
contemptible
meanness
of
sapping
the
very
of
our
noble
institutions
by
encouraging
a
fatal
precedent
which
ignores
all
principle
and
would
soon
prevent
any
honest
man
however
distinguished
for
his
intelligence
and
loyalty
from
representing

none
could
then
succeed
except
unprincipled
vagabonds

by
the
lavish
expenditure
of

would
debauch

degrade

coveted

as
i
am
for

honor

unanimous
nomination
for

from

loyal

party
in
my
district
i
have
no
aspiration
for
that
high
position
if
it
is
only
to
be
attained
by
bringing
into
disgrace
the
noble
privilege
of
the

think
for
a
moment
what
a
deadly
weapon
is
being
placed
in
the
hands
of
tyrants
throughout
the
civilized
world
with
which
to
destroy
such
apostles
of
liberty
as
john
bright
and
garibaldi
if
it
can
be
said
with
truth
that
american
citizens
have
become
so
corrupt
and
degraded
so
lost
to
a
just
estimate
of
the
value
and
true
nobility
of
the
ballot
that
it
is
bought
and
sold
for
money
my
dear
sir
any
party
that
can
gain
a
temporary
ascendancy
by
such
atrocious
means
not
only
poisons
the
body
politic
of
a
free
and
impartial
government
but
is
also
sure
to
bring
swift
destruction
upon
itself
and
so
it
should
be
i
am
unaccustomed
to
political
life
and
know
but
little
of
the
manner
of
conducting
a
campaign
like
the
present
i
believe
however
it
is
customary
for
the
state
central
committee
to
assess
candidates
in
order
that
they
shall
defray
a
proper
portion
of
the
expenses
incurred
for
speakers
and
documents
to
the
voters
upon
the
political
issues
of
the
day
to
that
extent
i
am
willing
and
anxious
to
be
taxed
for
light
and
knowledge
are
always
desired
by
the
friends
of
human
rights
and
of
public
order
but
i
trust
that
all
money
used
for
any
other
purpose
in
the
pending
election
will
come
from
the
pockets
of
those
who
now
as
during
the
rebellion
are
doing
their
utmost
to
aid
traitors
and
who
still
unrepenting
are
vindictively
striving
to
secure
at
the
what
their
southern
allies
failed
to
accomplish
on
the
field
of
battle
if
any
of
our
friends
misapprehend
my
true
sentiments
upon
the
subject
of
bribery
corruption
and
fraud
i

you
will

i

b
when
congress
met
i
was
surprised
to
see
by
the
newspapers
that
the
seat
of
my
opponent
was
to
be
contested
on
account
of
alleged
bribery
fraud
and
corruption
in
securing
his
election
this
was
the
first
intimation
that
i
had
ever
received
of
such
an
intention
and
i
was
never
at
any
time
before
or
afterwards
consulted
upon
the
subject
the
movement
proved
to
have
originated
with
neighbors
and
townsmen
of
the
successful
candidate
who
claimed
to
be
able
to
prove
that
he
had
paid
large
sums
of
money
to
purchase
votes
they
also
claimed
that
they
had
proof
that
men
were
brought
from
an
adjoining
state
to
vote
and
that
in
the
office
of
the
successful
candidate
naturalization
papers
were
forged
to
enable
foreigners
to
vote
upon
them
but
i
repeat
i
took
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
matter
but
concluded
that
if
i
had
been
defeated
by
fraud
mine
was
the
real
success

when
the

burned
down
and
while
the

were
still
smoking
i
had
numerous
applications
for
the
purchase
of

lease
of

two
lots
by

hundred
feet
which
had
still
nearly
eleven
years
to

it
will
be
remembered
that
in
i
came
back
from
england
while
my
second
lease
of
five
years
had
yet
three
years
more
to
run
and
renewed
that
lease
for
years
from
at
an
annual
rental
of
it
was
also
stipulated
that
in
case
the
building
was
destroyed
by
fire
the
proprietor
of
the
property
should
expend
thousand
dollars
towards
the
erection
of
a
new
edifice
and
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
lease
he
was
to
pay
me
the
appraised
value
of
the
building
not
to
exceed
rents
and
real
estate
values
had
trebled
since
i
took
this
years
lease
and
hence
the
remaining
term
was
very
valuable
i
engaged
an
experienced
and
competent
real
estate
broker
in
pine
street
to
examine
the
terms
of
my
lease
and
in
view
of
his
knowledge
of
the
cost
of
erecting
buildings
and
the
rentals
they
were
commanding
in
broadway
i
enjoined
him
to
take
his
time
and
make
a
careful
estimate
of
what
the
lease
was
worth
to
me
and
what
price
i
ought
to
receive
if
i
sold
it
to
another
party
at
the
end
of
several
days
he
showed
me
his
figures
which
proved
that
the
lease
was
fully
worth
as
i
was
inclined
to
have
a
museum
higher
up
town
i
did
not
wish
to
engage
in
erecting
two
buildings
at
once
so
i
concluded
to
offer
my
museum
lease
for
sale
accordingly
i
put
it
into
the
hands
of
homer
morgan
with
directions
to
offer
it
for
which
was
less
than
the
value
at
which
it
had
been
estimated
the
next
day
i
met
james
gordon
bennett
who
told
me
that
he
desired
to
buy
my
lease
and
at
the
same
time
to
purchase
the
fee
of
the
museum
property
for
the
erection
thereon
of
a
publication
building
for
the
new
york
i
said
i
thought
it
was
very
fitting
the
should
be
the
successor
of
the
museum
and
bennett
asked
my
price
please
to
go
or
send
immediately
to
homer
morgan
s
office
i
replied
and
you
will
learn
that
morgan
has
the
lease
for
sale
at
this
is
less
than
its
estimated
value
but
to
you
i
will
deduct
from
my
already
reduced
price
so
you
may
have
the
lease
for
bennett
replied
that
he
would
look
into
the
affair
closely
and
the
next
day
his
attorney
sent
for
my
lease
he
kept
it
several
days
and
then
appointed
an
hour
for
me
to
come
to
his
office
i
called
according
to
appointment
bennett
and
his
attorney
had
thoroughly
examined
the
lease
it
was
the
property
of
my
wife
bennett
concluded
to
accept
my
offer
my
wife
assigned
the
lease
to
him
and
his
attorney
handed
me
bennett
s
check
on
the
chemical
bank
for
that
same
day
i
invested
in
united
states
bonds
and
the
remaining
was
similarly
invested
on
the
following
day
i
learned
at
that
time
that
bennett
had
agreed
to
purchase
the
fee
of
the
property
for
he
had
been
informed
that
the
property
was
worth
some
to
and
he
did
not
mind
paying
extra
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
his
plans
but
the
parties
who
estimated
for
him
the
value
of
the
land
knew
nothing
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
lease
upon
the
property
else
of
course
they
would
in
their
estimate
have
deducted
the
which
the
lease
would
cost
when
therefore
bennett
saw
it
stated
in
the
newspapers
that
the
sum
which
he
had
paid
for
a
piece
of
land
measuring
only
by
one
hundred
feet
was
more
than
was
ever
before
paid
in
any
city
in
the
world
for
a
tract
of
that
size
he
discovered
the
serious
oversight
which
he
had
made
and
the
owner
of
the
property
was
immediately
informed
that
bennett
would
not
take
it
but
bennett
had
already
signed
a
bond
to
the
owner
agreeing
to
pay
cash
and
to
mortgage
the
premises
for
the
remaining
supposing
that
by
this
step
he
had
shaken
off
the
owner
of
the
fee
bennett
was
not
long
in
seeing
that
as
he
was
not
to
own
the
land
he
would
have
no
possible
use
for
the
lease
for
which
he
had
paid
the
and
accordingly
his
next
step
was
to
shake
me
off
also
and
get
back
the
money
he
had
paid
me
at
this
time
bennett
was
ruling
the
managers
of
the
theatres
and
other
amusements
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
had
established
a
large
job
printing
office
in
connection
with
the
office
and
woe
to
the
manager
who
presumed
to
have
his
bills
printed
elsewhere
any
manager
who
dared
to
decline
employing
bennett
s
job
office
to
print
his
small
bills
and
posters
at
bennett
s
exorbitant
prices
was
ignored
in
the
his
advertisements
were
refused
and
generally
he
and
his
establishment
were
and
blackguarded
in
the
columns
of
the
of
course
most
of
the
managers
were
somewhat
sensitive
to
such
attacks
and
therefore
submitted
to
his
impositions
in
the
job
office
his
double
price
for
newspaper
advertisements
and
any
other
overbearing
conditions
the
might
choose
to
dictate
the
advertisements
of
the
academy
of
music
then
under
the
direction
of
max
maretzek
had
been
refused
on
account
of
some
dissatisfaction
in
the
office
in
regard
to
free
boxes
and
also
because
the
prima
donna
miss
clara
louise
kellogg
had
certain
ideas
of
her
own
with
regard
to
social
intercourse
with
certain
people
as
miss
jenny
lind
had
with
regard
to
the
same
people
when
she
was
under
my
management
and
to
some
degree
under
my
advice
and
these
ideas
were
not
particularly
relished
by
the
power
behind
the
throne
for
my
own
part
i
thoroughly
understood
bennett
and
his
concern
and
i
never
cared
one
farthing
for
him
or
his
paper
i
had
seen
for
years
especially
as
bennett
s
enormously
overestimated
influence
applied
to
public
amusements
that
whatever
the
praised
sickened
drooped
and
if
the
persisted
in
praising
it
finally
died
while
whatever
the
attacked
prospered
and
all
the
more
the
more
it
was
abused
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
bennett
to
injure
me
unless
he
had
some
more
potent
weapon
than
his
and
that
this
was
the
general
opinion
was
quite
evident
from
the
fact
that
several
years
had
elapsed
since
gentlemen
were
in
the
almost
daily
habit
of
cuffing
kicking
and
cowhiding
bennett
in
the
streets
and
other
public
places
for
his
scurrilous
attacks
upon
them
or
upon
members
of
their
families
it
had
come
to
be
seen
that
what
the
said
good
or
bad
was
like
the
editor
himself
literally
of
no
my
business
for
many
years
as
manager
of
the
museum
and
other
public
entertainments
compelled
me
to
court
notoriety
and
i
always
found
bennett
s
abuse
far
more
remunerative
than
his
praise
even
if
i
could
have
had
the
praise
at
the
same
price
that
is
for
nothing
especially
was
it
profitable
to
me
when
i
could
be
the
subject
of
scores
of
lines
of
his
scolding
editorials
free
of
charge
instead
of
paying
him
forty
cents
a
line
for
advertisements
which
would
not
attract
a
tenth
part
so
much
attention
bennett
had
tried
abusing
me
off
and
on
for
twenty
years
on
one
occasion
refusing
my
advertisement
altogether
for
the
space
of
about
a
year
but
i
always
managed
to
be
the
gainer
by
his
course
now
however
when
new
difficulties
threatened
all
the
leading
managers
in
new
york
were
members
of
the
managers
association
and
as
we
all
submitted
to
the
arbitrary
and
extortionate
demands
of
the
bennett
thought
he
had
but
to
crack
his
whip
in
order
to
keep
any
and
all
of
us
within
the
traces
the
great
ogre
of
the
supposed
he
could
at
all
times
frighten
the
little
managerial
boys
into
any
holes
which
might
be
left
open
for
them
to
hide
in
accordingly
one
day
bennett
s
attorney
wrote
me
a
letter
saying
that
he
would
like
to
have
me
call
on
him
at
his
office
the
following
morning
not
dreaming
of
the
object
i
called
as
desired
and
after
a
few
pleasant
commonplace
remarks
about
the
weather
and
other
trifles
the
attorney
said
mr
barnum
i
have
sent
for
you
to
say
that
bennett
has
concluded
not
to
purchase
the
museum
lots
and
therefore
that
you
had
better
take
back
the
lease
and
return
the
paid
for
are
you
in
earnest
i
asked
with
surprise
certainly
quite
so
he
answered
really
i
said
smiling
i
am
sorry
i
can
t
accommodate
bennett
i
have
not
got
the
little
sum
about
me
in
fact
i
have
spent
the
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
take
back
the
lease
said
the
attorney
seriously
nonsense
i
replied
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
don
t
make
child
s
bargains
the
lease
was
cheap
enough
but
i
have
other
business
to
attend
to
and
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
attorney
said
very
little
in
reply
but
i
could
see
by
the
almost
benignant
sorrow
expressed
upon
his
countenance
that
he
evidently
pitied
me
for
the
temerity
that
would
doubtless
lead
me
into
the
jaws
of
the
insatiable
monster
of
the
the
next
morning
i
observed
that
the
advertisement
of
my
entertainments
with
my
museum
company
at
winter
garden
was
left
out
of
the
columns
i
went
directly
to
the
editorial
rooms
of
the
and
learning
that
bennett
was
not
in
i
said
to
hudson
then
managing
editor
my
advertisement
is
left
out
of
the
is
there
a
screw
loose
i
believe
there
is
was
the
reply
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
you
must
ask
the
emperor
said
hudson
meaning
of
course
bennett
when
will
the
emperor
be
in
i
inquired
next
monday
was
the
answer
well
i
shall
not
see
him
i
replied
but
i
wish
to
have
this
thing
settled
at
once
hudson
i
now
tender
you
the
money
for
the
insertion
of
my
museum
advertisement
on
the
same
terms
as
are
paid
by
other
places
of
amusement
will
you
publish
it
i
will
not
hudson
peremptorily
replied
that
is
all
i
said
hudson
then
smilingly
and
blandly
remarked
i
have
formally
answered
your
formal
demand
because
i
suppose
you
require
it
but
you
know
barnum
i
can
only
obey
i
assured
him
that
i
understood
the
matter
perfectly
and
attached
no
blame
to
him
in
the
premises
i
then
proceeded
to
notify
the
secretary
of
the
managers
association
to
call
the
managers
together
at
twelve
o
clock
the
following
day
and
there
was
a
full
meeting
at
the
appointed
time
i
stated
the
facts
in
the
case
in
the
affair
and
simply
remarked
that
if
we
did
not
make
common
cause
against
any
newspaper
publisher
who
excluded
an
advertisement
from
his
columns
simply
to
gratify
a
private
pique
it
was
evident
that
either
and
all
of
us
were
liable
to
imposition
at
any
time
one
of
the
managers
immediately
made
a
motion
that
the
entire
association
should
stop
their
advertising
and
bill
printing
at
the
office
and
have
no
further
connection
with
that
establishment
lester
wallack
advised
that
this
motion
should
not
be
adopted
until
a
committee
had
waited
upon
bennett
and
had
reported
the
result
of
the
interview
to
the
association
accordingly
wallack
wheatley
and
stuart
were
delegated
to
go
down
to
the
office
to
call
on
bennett
the
moment
bennett
saw
them
he
evidently
suspected
the
object
of
their
mission
for
he
at
once
commenced
to
speak
to
wallack
in
a
patronizing
manner
told
him
how
long
he
had
known
and
how
much
he
respected
his
late
father
who
was
a
true
english
gentleman
of
the
old
school
with
much
more
in
the
same
strain
wallack
replied
to
bennett
that
the
three
managers
were
appointed
a
committee
to
wait
upon
him
to
ascertain
if
he
insisted
upon
excluding
from
his
columns
the
museum
advertisements
not
on
account
of
any
objection
to
the
contents
of
the
advertisements
or
to
the
museum
itself
but
simply
because
he
had
a
private
business
disagreement
with
the
proprietor
intimating
that
such
a
proceeding
for
such
a
reason
and
no
other
might
lead
to
a
rupture
of
business
relations
with
other
managers
in
reply
bennett
had
something
to
say
about
the
fox
that
had
suffered
tailwise
from
a
trap
and
thereupon
advised
all
other
foxes
to
cut
their
tails
off
and
he
pointed
the
fable
by
setting
forth
the
impolicy
of
drawing
down
upon
the
association
the
vengeance
of
the
the
committee
however
coolly
insisted
upon
a
direct
answer
to
their
question
bennett
then
answered
i
will
not
publish
barnum
s
advertisement
i
do
my
business
as
i
please
and
in
my
own
so
do
we
replied
one
of
the
managers
and
the
committee
withdrew
the
next
day
the
managers
association
met
heard
the
report
and
unanimously
resolved
to
withdraw
their
advertisements
from
the
and
their
patronage
from
the
job
establishment
and
it
was
done
nevertheless
the
for
several
days
continued
to
print
gratuitously
the
advertisements
of
wallack
s
theatre
and
niblo
s
garden
and
inordinately
puffed
these
establishments
evidently
in
order
to
ease
the
fall
and
to
convey
the
idea
that
some
of
the
theatres
patronized
the
and
perhaps
hoping
by
praising
these
managers
to
draw
them
back
again
and
so
to
nullify
the
agreement
of
the
association
in
regard
to
the
thereupon
the
managers
headed
their
advertisements
in
all
the
other
new
york
papers
with
the
line
this
establishment
does
not
advertise
in
the
new
york
and
for
many
months
this
announcement
was
kept
at
the
top
of
every
theatrical
advertisement
and
on
the
posters
and
playbills
the
then
began
to
abuse
and
vilify
the
theatrical
and
opera
managers
their
artists
and
their
performances
and
by
way
of
contrast
profusely
praised
tony
pastor
s
bowery
show
and
sundry
entertainments
of
a
similar
character
thereby
speedily
bringing
some
of
these
to
grief
and
shutting
up
their
shops
meanwhile
the
theatres
prospered
amazingly
under
the
abuse
of
bennett
their
receipts
were
never
larger
and
their
houses
never
more
thronged
the
public
took
sides
in
the
matter
with
the
managers
and
against
the
and
thousands
of
people
went
to
the
theatres
merely
to
show
their
willingness
to
support
the
managers
and
to
spite
old
the
editor
was
fairly
caught
in
his
own
trap
other
journals
began
to
estimate
the
loss
the
sustained
by
the
action
of
the
managers
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
this
loss
in
advertising
and
job
printing
was
not
less
than
from
to
a
year
the
circulation
also
suffered
terribly
since
hundreds
of
people
at
the
hotels
and
elsewhere
who
were
accustomed
to
buy
the
paper
solely
for
the
sake
of
seeing
what
amusements
were
announced
for
the
evening
now
bought
other
papers
this
was
the
hardest
blow
of
all
and
it
fully
accounted
for
the
abuse
which
the
daily
poured
out
upon
the
theatres
but
the
more
bennett
raved
the
more
the
people
laughed
and
the
more
determined
did
they
seem
to
patronize
the
managers
many
people
came
to
the
museum
who
said
they
came
expressly
to
show
us
that
the
public
were
with
us
and
against
the
the
other
managers
stated
their
experience
to
be
the
same
in
this
respect
in
fact
it
was
a
subject
of
general
remark
that
without
exception
the
associated
managers
never
had
done
such
a
thriving
business
as
during
the
two
years
in
which
they
gave
the
the
cold
shoulder
bennett
evidently
felt
ashamed
of
the
whole
transaction
he
would
never
publish
the
facts
in
his
columns
though
he
once
stated
in
an
editorial
that
it
had
been
reported
that
he
had
been
cheated
in
purchasing
the
broadway
property
that
the
case
had
gone
to
court
and
the
public
would
soon
know
all
the
particulars
some
persons
supposed
by
this
that
bennett
had
sued
me
but
this
was
far
from
being
the
case
the
owner
of
the
lots
sued
bennett
to
compel
him
to
take
the
title
and
pay
for
the
property
as
per
agreement
and
that
was
all
the
law
there
was
about
it
he
held
james
gordon
bennett
s
bond
that
he
would
pay
him
half
a
million
of
dollars
for
the
land
as
follows
cash
and
a
bond
and
mortgage
upon
the
premises
for
the
remaining
the
day
before
the
suit
was
to
come
to
trial
bennett
came
forward
took
the
deed
and
paid
cash
and
gave
a
bond
and
mortgage
of
the
entire
premises
for
that
lien
still
exists
against
the
property
had
i
really
taken
back
the
lease
as
bennett
desired
he
would
have
been
in
a
worse
scrape
than
ever
for
having
been
compelled
to
take
the
property
he
would
have
been
obliged
as
my
landlord
to
go
on
and
assist
in
building
a
museum
for
me
according
to
the
terms
of
my
lease
and
a
museum
i
should
certainly
have
built
on
bennett
s
property
even
if
i
had
owned
a
dozen
museums
up
town
as
it
was
bennett
was
badly
beaten
on
every
side
and
especially
by
the
managers
who
forever
established
the
fact
that
the
abuse
was
profitable
and
its
patronage
fatal
to
any
enterprise
and
who
taught
bennett
personally
the
lesson
of
his
own
insignificance
as
he
had
not
learned
it
since
the
days
when
gentlemen
used
to
kick
and
cowhide
him
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
nassau
street
in
the
autumn
of
the
associated
managers
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
punishment
of
bennett
for
two
years
was
sufficient
and
they
consented
to
restore
their
advertisements
to
the
i
was
then
associated
with
the
van
amburgh
company
in
my
new
museum
and
we
concluded
that
the
cost
of
advertising
in
the
was
more
than
it
was
worth
and
so
we
did
not
enter
into
the
new
arrangement
made
by
the

i
was
to
receive
one
hundred
dollars
for
every
repetition
of
my
lecture
with
all
my
travelling
expenses
on
the
route
agreeing
to
these
terms
i
commenced
the
engagement
at
the
appointed
time
and
averaging
five
lectures
a
week
i
finished
the
prescribed
round
just
before
new
year
s
before
beginning
this
engagement
however
i
gave
the
lecture
for
other
associations
at
wheeling
virginia
cincinnati
ohio
and
louisville
kentucky
i
also
delivered
the
lecture
in
chicago
for
professor
eastman
who
at
that
time
had
one
of
his
business
colleges
in
that
city
he
engaged
the
celebrated
crosby
opera
house
for
the
occasion
and
i
think
with
perhaps
two
exceptions
i
never
spoke
before
so
large
and
intelligent
an
audience
as
was
there
assembled
it
was
estimated
that
from
five
to
six
thousand
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
gathered
in
that
capacious
building
and
nearly
as
many
more
went
away
unable
to
obtain
admission
i
was
glad
to
observe
by
the
action
of
the
audience
and
by
the
journals
of
the
following
day
that
my
efforts
on
that
occasion
were
satisfactory
indeed
though
it
is
necessarily
egotistical
i
may
truly
say
that
with
this
lecture
i
always
succeeded
in
pleasing
my
hearers
i
may
add
that
i
have
invariably
as
a
rule
devoted
to
charitable
purposes
every
penny
i
ever
received
for
lecturing
except
while
i
was
under
the
great
jerome
clock
cloud
in
england
when
i
needed
all
i
could
earn
my
western
tour
was
delightful
indeed
it
was
almost
an
ovation
i
found
in
fact
that
when
i
had
strayed
so
far
from
home
the
curiosity
exhibitor
himself
became
quite
a
curiosity
on
several
occasions
in
iowa
i
was
introduced
to
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
had
driven
thirty
miles
in
carriages
to
hear
me
i
insisted
however
that
it
was
more
to
see
than
to
hear
and
i
asked
them
if
that
was
not
really
the
case
in
several
instances
they
answered
in
the
affirmative
in
fact
one
quaint
old
lady
said
why
to
tell
you
the
truth
barnum
we
have
read
so
much
about
you
and
your
museum
and
your
queer
that
we
were
not
quite
sure
but
you
had
horns
and
cloven
feet
and
so
we
came
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
but
la
me
i
don
t
see
but
what
you
look
a
good
deal
like
other
folks
after
while
at
the
west
i
visited
my
sister
minerva
drew
and
her
family
at
bristol
wisconsin
where
they
reside
on
a
farm
which
i
presented
to
her
about
twenty
years
ago
her
children
having
grown
up
and
married
all
except
her
son
fairchild
b
drew
who
had
just
attained
his
majority
his
father
ezekiel
drew
wished
to
retain
his
services
on
the
farm
fairchild
however
felt
that
the
farm
was
not
quite
large
enough
for
his
aspirations
i
found
also
that
he
coveted
a
neighboring
farm
which
with
its
stock
was
for
sale
for
less
than
five
thousand
dollars
i
bought
it
for
him
on
condition
that
he
should
continue
the
care
of
the
old
farm
and
that
the
two
should
be
worked
together
i
trust
that
the
arrangement
will
prove
beneficial
to
all
concerned
for
there
is
great
pleasure
in
helping
others
who
try
to
help
themselves
without
such
effort
on
their
part
all
good
offices
in
their
favor
are
thrown
away
it
is
simply
attempting
to
make
a
sieve
hold
water
on
my
tour
in
attempting
to
make
the
connection
from
cleveland
ohio
to
fort
wayne
indiana
via
toledo
i
arrived
at
the
latter
city
at
one
o
clock
which
was
about
two
hours
too
late
to
catch
the
train
in
time
for
the
hour
announced
for
my
lecture
that
evening
i
went
to
andrews
the
superintendent
of
the
toledo
wabash
and
western
railway
and
told
him
i
wanted
to
hire
a
locomotive
and
car
to
run
to
fort
wayne
as
i
must
be
there
at
eight
o
clock
at
night
it
is
an
impossibility
said
andrews
the
distance
is
miles
and
no
train
leaves
here
till
morning
the
road
is
much
occupied
by
freight
trains
and
we
never
run
extra
trains
in
this
part
of
the
country
unless
the
necessity
is
i
suppose
i
looked
astonished
as
well
as
chagrined
i
knew
that
if
i
missed
lecturing
in
fort
wayne
that
evening
i
could
not
appoint
another
time
for
that
purpose
for
every
night
was
engaged
during
the
next
two
months
i
also
felt
that
a
large
number
of
persons
in
fort
wayne
would
be
disappointed
and
i
grew
desperate
drawing
my
wallet
from
my
pocket
i
said
i
will
give
two
hundred
dollars
and
even
more
if
you
say
so
to
be
put
into
fort
wayne
before
eight
o
clock
and
really
i
hope
you
will
accommodate
the
superintendent
looked
me
thoroughly
over
in
half
a
minute
and
i
fancied
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
a
burglar
a
counterfeiter
or
something
worse
fleeing
from
justice
my
surmise
was
confirmed
when
he
slowly
remarked
your
business
must
be
very
pressing
it
is
indeed
i
replied
i
am
barnum
the
museum
man
and
am
engaged
to
speak
in
fort
wayne
he
evidently
did
not
catch
the
whole
of
my
response
for
he
immediately
said
oh
it
is
a
show
eh
where
is
old
barnum
himself
i
am
barnum
i
replied
and
it
is
a
lecture
which
i
am
advertised
to
give
and
i
would
not
disappoint
the
people
for
is
this
barnum
said
the
superintendent
starting
to
his
feet
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
i
replied
well
barnum
said
he
earnestly
if
you
can
stand
it
to
ride
to
fort
wayne
in
the
caboose
of
a
freight
train
your
reputation
for
punctuality
in
keeping
your
engagements
shall
not
suffer
on
account
of
the
toledo
wabash
and
western
caboose
said
i
with
a
laugh
i
would
ride
to
fort
wayne
astride
of
the
engine
or
boxed
up
and
stowed
away
in
a
freight
car
if
necessary
in
order
to
meet
my
a
freight
train
was
on
the
point
of
starting
for
fort
wayne
all
the
cars
were
at
once
ordered
to
be
switched
off
except
two
which
the
superintendent
said
were
necessary
to
balance
the
train
the
freight
trains
on
the
road
were
telegraphed
to
clear
the
track
and
the
polite
superintendent
pointing
to
the
caboose
invited
me
to
step
in
i
drew
out
my
to
pay
but
he
smilingly
shook
his
head
and
said
you
have
a
through
ticket
from
cleveland
to
fort
wayne
hand
it
to
the
freight
agent
on
your
arrival
and
all
will
be
i
was
much
moved
by
this
unexpected
mark
of
kindness
and
expressing
myself
to
that
effect
i
stepped
into
the
caboose
and
we
started
the
excited
state
of
mind
which
i
had
suffered
while
under
the
impression
that
the
audience
in
fort
wayne
must
be
disappointed
now
changed
and
i
felt
as
happy
as
a
king
in
fact
i
enjoyed
a
new
sensation
of
imperial
superiority
in
that
i
was
monarch
of
all
i
surveyed
emperor
of
my
own
train
switching
all
other
trains
from
the
main
track
and
making
conductors
all
along
the
line
wonder
what
grand
mogul
had
thus
taken
complete
possession
and
control
of
the
road
indeed
as
we
sped
past
each
train
which
stood
quietly
on
a
side
track
waiting
for
us
to
pass
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
glances
of
excited
curiosity
which
were
thrown
into
our
car
by
the
agent
and
brakemen
of
the
train
which
had
been
so
peremptorily
ordered
to
clear
illustration
great
the
track
and
always
stepping
at
the
caboose
door
i
raised
my
hat
receiving
in
return
an
almost
reverent
salute
which
the
occupants
of
the
waiting
train
thought
due
no
doubt
to
the
distinguished
person
for
whom
they
were
ordered
by
special
telegram
to
make
way
i
now
began
to
reflect
that
the
fort
wayne
lecture
committee
upon
discovering
that
i
did
not
arrive
by
the
regular
passenger
train
would
not
expect
me
at
all
and
that
probably
they
might
issue
small
bills
announcing
my
failure
to
arrive
i
therefore
prepared
the
following
telegram
which
i
despatched
to
them
on
our
arrival
at
napoleon
the
first
station
at
which
we
stopped
lecture
committee
fort
wayne
rest
perfectly
tranquil
i
am
to
be
delivered
at
fort
wayne
by
contract
by
seven
o
clock
special
train
at
the
same
station
i
received
a
telegram
from
andrews
the
superintendent
asking
me
how
i
liked
the
caboose
i
replied
the
springs
of
the
caboose
are
softer
than
down
i
am
as
happy
as
a
clam
at
high
water
i
am
being
carried
towards
fort
wayne
in
a
style
never
surpassed
by
cÃ¦sar
s
triumphal
march
into
rome
hurrah
for
the
toledo
and
wabash
railroad
at
the
invitation
of
the
engineer
i
took
a
ride
of
twenty
miles
upon
the
locomotive
it
fairly
made
my
head
swim
i
could
not
reconcile
my
mind
to
the
idea
that
there
was
no
danger
and
intimating
to
the
engineer
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
get
where
i
could
not
see
ahead
i
was
permitted
to
crawl
back
again
to
the
caboose
i
reached
fort
wayne
in
ample
time
for
the
lecture
and
as
the
committee
had
discreetly
kept
to
themselves
the
fact
of
my
by
the
regular
train
probably
not
a
dozen
persons
were
aware
of
the
trouble
i
had
taken
to
fulfil
my
engagement
till
in
the
course
of
my
lecture
under
the
head
of
perseverance
i
recounted
my
day
s
adventures
as
an
illustration
of
exercising
that
quality
when
real
necessity
demanded
the
fort
wayne
papers
of
the
next
day
published
accounts
of
barnum
on
a
locomotive
and
a
journey
in
a
caboose
and
as
i
always
had
an
eye
to
advertising
these
articles
were
sent
marked
to
newspapers
in
towns
and
cities
where
i
was
to
lecture
and
of
course
were
copied
thus
producing
the
desired
effects
first
of
informing
the
public
that
the
showman
was
coming
and
next
assuring
the
lecture
committee
that
barnum
would
be
punctually
on
hand
as
advertised
unless
prevented
by
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
the
managers
of
railroads
running
west
from
chicago
pretty
rigidly
enforce
a
rule
excluding
from
certain
reserved
cars
all
gentlemen
travelling
without
ladies
as
i
do
not
smoke
i
avoided
the
smoking
cars
and
as
the
ladies
car
was
sometimes
more
select
and
always
more
comfortable
than
the
other
cars
i
tried
various
expedients
to
smuggle
myself
in
if
i
saw
a
lady
about
to
enter
the
car
alone
i
followed
closely
hoping
thus
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
brakeman
who
generally
acted
as
but
the
car
cerberus
is
pretty
well
up
to
all
such
dodges
and
i
did
not
always
succeed
on
one
occasion
seeing
a
young
couple
evidently
just
married
and
starting
on
a
bridal
tour
about
to
enter
the
car
i
followed
closely
but
was
stopped
by
the
who
called
out
how
many
gentlemen
are
with
this
i
have
always
noticed
that
young
people
are
very
fond
of
saying
my
husband
and
my
wife
they
are
new
terms
which
sound
pleasantly
to
the
ears
of
those
who
utter
them
so
in
answer
to
the
peremptory
inquiry
of
the
the
bridegroom
promptly
responded
i
am
this
lady
s
and
i
guess
you
can
see
by
the
resemblance
between
the
lady
and
myself
said
i
to
cerberus
that
i
am
her
the
astounded
husband
and
the
blushing
bride
were
too
much
taken
aback
to
deny
their
parent
but
the
brakeman
said
as
he
permitted
the
young
couple
to
pass
into
the
car
we
can
t
pass
all
creation
with
one
i
hope
you
will
not
deprive
me
of
the
company
of
my
child
during
the
little
time
we
can
remain
together
i
said
with
a
demure
countenance
the
brakeman
evidently
sympathized
with
the
fond
parient
whose
feelings
were
sufficiently
lacerated
at
losing
his
daughter
through
her
finding
a
husband
and
i
was
permitted
to
pass
i
immediately
apologized
to
the
young
bride
and
her
husband
and
told
them
who
i
was
and
my
reasons
for
the
assumed
paternity
and
they
enjoyed
the
joke
so
heartily
that
they
called
me
father
during
our
entire
journey
together
indeed
the
husband
privately
and
slyly
hinted
to
me
that
the
first
boy
should
be
christened
p
my
friend
the
rev
chapin
by
the
by
an
inveterate
punster
is
never
tired
of
ringing
the
changes
on
the
names
in
my
family
he
says
that
my
wife
and
i
are
the
most
sympathetic
couple
he
ever
saw
since
she
is
charity
and
i
am
pity
on
one
occasion
at
my
house
in
new
york
he
called
my
attention
to
the
monogram
on
the
door
and
said
i
did
it
did
what
i
asked
why
that
replied
the
doctor
p
pull
the
bell
of
course
thus
literally
ringing
a
new
change
on
my
initials
at
another
time
during
my
western
lecturing
trip
i
was
following
closely
in
the
wake
of
a
lady
who
was
entering
the
favorite
car
when
the
brakeman
exclaimed
you
can
t
go
in
there
sir
i
rather
guess
i
can
go
in
with
a
lady
said
i
pointing
to
the
one
who
had
just
entered
not
with
that
lady
old
fellow
for
i
happen
to
know
her
and
that
is
more
than
you
do
we
are
up
to
all
these
travellers
tricks
out
here
it
s
no
i
saw
indeed
that
it
was
no
go
and
that
i
must
try
something
else
look
here
my
dear
fellow
said
i
i
am
travelling
every
day
on
the
railroads
on
a
lecturing
tour
throughout
the
west
and
i
really
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
take
a
seat
in
the
ladies
car
i
am
barnum
the
museum
man
from
new
looking
sharply
at
me
for
an
instant
the
altogether
too
brakeman
exclaimed
not
by
a
d
n
sight
you
ain
t
i
know
barnum
i
could
not
help
laughing
and
pulling
several
old
letters
from
my
pocket
and
showing
him
the
directions
on
the
envelopes
i
replied
well
you
may
know
him
but
the
old
fellow
has
changed
in
his
appearance
perhaps
you
see
by
these
letters
that
i
am
the
the
brakeman
looked
astonished
but
finally
said
well
that
is
a
fact
sure
enough
i
know
you
when
i
come
to
look
again
but
really
i
did
not
believe
you
at
first
you
see
we
have
all
sorts
of
tricks
played
on
us
and
we
learn
to
doubt
everybody
you
are
very
welcome
to
go
in
barnum
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
and
as
this
conversation
was
heard
throughout
the
car
barnum
the
showman
was
the
subject
of
general
observation
and
remark
i
fulfilled
my
entire
engagement
which
covered
the
lecturing
season
and
returned
to
new
york
greatly
pleased
with
my
western
tour
public
lecturing
was
by
no
means
a
new
experience
with
me
for
apart
from
my
labors
in
that
direction
in
england
and
occasional
addresses
before
literary
and
agricultural
associations
at
home
i
had
been
prominently
in
the
field
for
many
years
as
a
lecturer
on
temperance
my
attention
was
turned
to
this
subject
in
the
following
manner
in
the
fall
of
while
exhibiting
general
tom
thumb
at
saratoga
springs
where
the
new
york
state
fair
was
then
being
held
i
saw
so
much
intoxication
among
men
of
wealth
and
intellect
filling
the
highest
positions
in
society
that
i
began
to
ask
myself
the
question
what
guarantee
is
there
that
may
not
become
a
drunkard
and
i
forthwith
pledged
myself
at
that
time
never
again
to
partake
of
any
kind
of
spirituous
liquors
as
a
beverage
true
i
continued
to
partake
of
wine
for
i
had
been
instructed
in
my
european
tour
that
this
was
one
of
the
innocent
and
charming
indispensables
of
life
i
however
regarded
myself
as
a
good
temperance
man
and
soon
began
to
persuade
my
friends
to
refrain
from
the
intoxicating
cup
seeing
need
of
reform
in
bridgeport
i
invited
my
friend
the
reverend
doctor
chapin
to
visit
us
for
the
purpose
of
giving
a
public
temperance
lecture
i
had
never
heard
him
on
that
subject
but
i
knew
that
on
whatever
topic
he
spoke
he
was
as
logical
as
he
was
eloquent
he
lectured
in
the
baptist
church
in
bridgeport
his
subject
was
presented
in
three
divisions
the
the
moderate
drinker
and
the
indifferent
man
it
happened
therefore
that
the
second
if
not
the
third
clause
of
the
subject
had
a
special
bearing
upon
me
and
my
position
the
eloquent
gentleman
overwhelmingly
proved
that
the
respectable
in
his
splendid
saloon
or
hotel
bar
and
who
sold
only
to
gentlemen
inflicted
much
greater
injury
upon
the
community
than
a
dozen
common
groggeries
which
he
abundantly
illustrated
he
then
took
up
the
moderate
drinker
and
urged
that
he
was
the
great
to
the
temperance
reform
he
it
was
and
not
the
drunkard
in
the
ditch
that
the
young
man
looked
at
as
an
example
when
he
took
his
first
glass
that
when
the
drunkard
was
asked
to
sign
the
pledge
he
would
reply
why
should
i
do
so
what
harm
can
there
be
in
drinking
when
such
men
as
respectable
a
and
moral
b
drink
wine
under
their
own
roof
he
urged
that
the
higher
a
man
stood
in
the
community
the
greater
was
his
influence
either
for
good
or
for
evil
he
said
to
the
moderate
drinker
sir
you
either
do
or
you
do
not
consider
it
a
privation
and
a
sacrifice
to
give
up
drinking
which
is
it
if
you
say
that
you
can
drink
or
let
it
alone
that
you
can
quit
it
forever
without
considering
it
a
then
i
appeal
to
you
as
a
man
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
your
suffering
he
further
argued
that
if
it
was
a
to
give
up
then
certainly
the
man
should
stop
for
he
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
drunkard
what
doctor
chapin
said
produced
a
deep
impression
upon
my
mind
and
after
a
night
of
anxious
thought
i
rose
in
the
morning
took
my
champagne
bottles
knocked
off
their
heads
and
poured
their
contents
upon
the
ground
i
then
called
upon
doctor
chapin
asked
him
for
the
teetotal
pledge
and
signed
it
he
was
greatly
surprised
in
discovering
that
i
was
not
already
a
teetotaler
he
supposed
such
was
the
case
from
the
fact
that
i
had
invited
him
to
lecture
and
he
little
thought
at
the
time
of
his
delivering
it
that
his
argument
to
the
moderate
drinker
was
at
all
applicable
to
me
i
felt
that
i
had
now
a
duty
to
perform
to
save
others
as
i
had
been
saved
and
on
the
very
morning
when
i
signed
the
pledge
i
obtained
over
twenty
signatures
in
bridgeport
i
talked
temperance
to
all
whom
i
met
and
very
soon
commenced
lecturing
upon
the
subject
in
the
adjacent
towns
and
villages
i
spent
the
entire
winter
and
spring
of
in
lecturing
through
my
native
state
always
travelling
at
my
own
expense
and
i
was
glad
to
know
that
i
aroused
many
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
to
the
importance
of
the
temperance
reform
i
also
lectured
frequently
in
the
cities
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
as
well
as
in
other
towns
in
the
neighboring
states
while
in
boston
with
jenny
lind
i
was
earnestly
solicited
to
deliver
two
temperance
lectures
in
the
tremont
temple
where
she
gave
her
concerts
i
did
so
and
though
an
admission
fee
was
charged
for
the
benefit
of
a
benevolent
society
the
building
on
each
occasion
was
crowded
in
the
course
of
my
tour
with
jenny
lind
i
was
frequently
solicited
to
lecture
on
temperance
on
evenings
when
she
did
not
sing
i
always
complied
when
it
was
in
my
power
in
this
way
i
lectured
in
baltimore
washington
charleston
new
orleans
cincinnati
louis
and
other
cities
also
in
the
ladies
saloon
of
the
steamer
lexington
on
sunday
morning
in
august
i
lectured
in
cleveland
ohio
and
several
other
towns
and
afterwards
in
chicago
illinois
and
in
kenosha
wisconsin
an
election
was
to
be
held
in
wisconsin
in
october
and
the
friends
of
prohibition
in
that
state
solicited
my
services
for
the
ensuing
month
and
i
could
not
refuse
them
i
therefore
hastened
home
to
transact
some
business
which
required
my
presence
for
a
few
days
and
then
returned
and
lectured
on
my
way
in
toledo
norwalk
ohio
and
chicago
illinois
i
made
the
tour
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
delivering
two
lectures
per
day
for
four
consecutive
weeks
to
crowded
and
attentive
audiences
my
lecture
in
new
orleans
when
i
was
in
that
city
was
in
the
great
lyceum
hall
in
charles
street
and
i
lectured
by
the
invitation
of
mayor
crossman
and
several
other
influential
gentlemen
the
immense
hall
contained
more
than
three
thousand
auditors
including
the
most
respectable
portion
of
the
new
orleans
public
i
was
in
capital
humor
and
had
warmed
myself
into
a
pleasant
state
of
excitement
feeling
that
the
audience
was
with
me
while
in
the
midst
of
an
argument
illustrating
the
poisonous
and
destructive
nature
of
alcohol
to
the
animal
economy
some
opponent
called
out
how
does
it
affect
us
externally
or
internally
i
replied
i
have
scarcely
ever
heard
more
tremendous
merriment
than
that
which
followed
this
reply
and
the
applause
was
so
prolonged
that
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
could
proceed
on
the
first
evening
when
i
lectured
in
cleveland
ohio
it
was
in
the
baptist
church
i
commenced
in
this
wise
if
there
are
any
ladies
or
gentlemen
present
who
have
never
suffered
in
consequence
of
the
use
of
intoxicating
drinks
as
a
beverage
either
directly
or
in
the
person
of
a
dear
relative
or
friend
i
will
thank
them
to
a
man
with
a
tolerably
glowing
countenance
arose
had
you
never
a
friend
who
was
intemperate
i
asked
never
was
the
positive
reply
a
giggle
ran
through
the
opposition
portion
of
the
audience
really
my
friends
i
said
i
feel
constrained
to
make
a
proposition
which
i
did
not
anticipate
i
am
as
you
are
all
aware
a
showman
and
i
am
always
on
the
lookout
for
curiosities
this
gentleman
is
a
stranger
to
me
but
if
he
will
satisfy
me
morning
that
he
is
a
man
of
credibility
and
that
no
friend
of
his
was
ever
intemperate
i
will
be
glad
to
engage
him
for
ten
weeks
at
per
week
to
exhibit
him
in
my
american
museum
in
new
york
as
the
greatest
curiosity
in
this
a
laugh
that
was
a
laugh
followed
this
announcement
they
may
laugh
but
it
is
a
fact
persisted
my
opponent
with
a
look
of
dogged
tenacity
the
gentleman
still
insists
that
it
is
a
fact
i
replied
i
would
like
therefore
to
make
one
simple
qualification
to
my
offer
i
made
it
on
the
supposition
that
at
some
period
of
his
life
he
had
friends
now
if
he
never
had
any
friends
i
withdraw
my
offer
otherwise
i
will
stick
to
this
and
the
shout
of
laughter
that
ensued
was
too
much
for
the
gentleman
and
he
sat
down
i
noticed
throughout
my
speech
that
he
paid
strict
attention
and
frequently
indulged
in
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
close
of
the
lecture
he
approached
me
and
extending
his
hand
which
i
readily
accepted
he
said
i
was
particularly
green
in
rising
having
once
stood
up
i
was
determined
not
to
be
put
down
but
your
last
remark
fixed
me
he
then
complimented
me
very
highly
on
the
reasonableness
of
my
arguments
and
declared
that
ever
afterwards
he
would
be
found
on
the
side
of
temperance
among
the
most
gratifying
incidents
of
my
life
have
been
several
of
a
similar
nature
to
the
following
after
a
temperance
speech
in
philadelphia
a
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
came
forward
signed
the
teetotal
pledge
and
then
giving
me
his
hand
he
said
mr
barnum
you
have
this
night
saved
me
from
ruin
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
tippling
and
it
has
kept
me
continually
under
the
harrow
this
gentleman
pointing
to
a
person
at
his
side
is
my
partner
in
business
and
i
know
he
is
glad
i
have
signed
the
pledge
yes
indeed
i
am
george
and
it
is
the
best
thing
you
ever
did
replied
his
partner
if
you
ll
only
stick
to
that
will
i
do
till
the
day
of
my
death
and
won
t
my
dear
little
wife
mary
cry
for
joy
when
i
tell
her
what
i
have
done
he
exclaimed
in
great
exultation
at
that
moment
he
was
a
happy
man
but
he
could
not
have
been
more
so
than
i
was
sir
william
don
who
came
to
this
country
and
acted
in
several
theatres
afterwards
going
to
australia
and
dying
i
believe
soon
after
his
return
to
england
once
heard
me
lecture
and
immediately
afterwards
came
forward
and
signed
the
pledge
he
kept
it
for
a
short
period
only
although
when
he
signed
he
said
that
strong
drink
was
the
bane
of
his
life
it
is
the
one
bane
of
too
many
brilliant
men
who
but
for
this
one
misfortune
might
attain
almost
every
desirable
success
in
life
i
may
add
that
i
have
lectured
in
montreal
canada
and
many
towns
and
cities
in
the
united
states
at
my
own
expense
one
of
the
greatest
consolations
i
now
enjoy
is
that
of
believing
i
have
carried
happiness
to
the
bosom
of
many
a
family
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
have
written
much
for
newspapers
on
various
subjects
and
always
with
earnestness
but
in
none
of
these
have
i
felt
so
deep
an
interest
as
in
that
of
the
temperance
reform
were
it
not
for
this
fact
i
should
be
reluctant
to
mention
that
besides
numerous
articles
for
the
daily
and
weekly
press
i
wrote
a
little
tract
on
the
liquor
business
which
expresses
my
practical
view
of
the
use
and
traffic
in
intoxicating
drinks
in
every
one
of
my
temperance
lectures
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
i
have
regularly
read
the
following
report
made
by
cortis
overseer
of
the
poor
in
vineland
new
jersey
though
we
have
a
population
of
people
for
the
period
of
six
months
no
settler
or
citizen
of
vineland
has
required
relief
at
my
hands
as
overseer
of
the
poor
within
seventy
days
there
has
only
been
one
case
among
what
we
call
the
floating
population
at
the
expense
of
during
the
entire
year
there
has
only
been
but
one
indictment
and
that
a
trifling
case
of
assault
and
battery
among
our
colored
population
so
few
are
the
fires
in
vineland
that
we
have
no
need
of
a
fire
department
there
has
only
been
one
house
burnt
down
in
a
year
and
two
slight
fires
which
were
soon
put
out
we
practically
have
no
debt
and
our
taxes
are
only
one
per
cent
on
the
valuation
the
police
expenses
of
vineland
amount
to
per
year
the
sum
paid
to
me
and
our
poor
expenses
a
mere
trifle
i
ascribe
this
remarkable
state
of
things
so
nearly
approaching
the
golden
age
to
the
industry
of
our
people
and
the
absence
of
king
alcohol
let
me
give
you
in
contrast
to
this
the
state
of
things
in
the
town
from
which
i
came
in
new
england
the
population
of
the
town
was
a
little
less
than
that
of
vineland
it
maintained
forty
liquor
shops
these
kept
busy
a
police
judge
city
marshal
assistant
marshal
four
night
watchmen
six
policemen
fires
were
almost
continual
that
small
place
maintained
a
paid
fire
department
of
four
companies
of
forty
men
each
at
an
expense
of
per
annum
i
belonged
to
this
department
for
six
years
and
the
fires
averaged
about
one
every
two
weeks
and
mostly
incendiary
the
support
of
the
poor
cost
per
annum
the
debt
of
the
township
was
the
condition
of
things
in
this
new
england
town
is
as
favorable
in
that
country
as
that
of
many
other
places
where
liquor
is
sold
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
an
amount
of
overwhelming
testimony
and
unanswerable
argument
in
this
one
brief
extract
that
makes
it
in
itself
one
of
the
most
perfect
and
powerful
temperance
lectures

at

how
i
was
not
beaten
opening
of
wood
s
museum
in
new
york
my
only
interest
in
the
enterprise
my
new
museum
on
broadway
was
liberally
patronized
from
the
start
but
i
felt
that
still
more
attractions
were
necessary
in
order
to
insure
constant
success
i
therefore
made
arrangements
with
the
renowned
van
amburgh
menagerie
company
to
unite
their
entire
collection
of
living
wild
animals
with
the
museum
the
new
company
was
known
as
the
barnum
and
van
amburgh
museum
and
menagerie
company
and
as
such
was
chartered
by
the
connecticut
legislature
the
new
york
legislature
having
refused
us
a
charter
unless
i
would
see
the
ring
a
thousand
dollars
worth
which
i
declined
i
owned
forty
per
cent
and
the
van
amburgh
company
held
the
remaining
sixty
per
cent
in
the
new
enterprise
which
comprehended
a
large
travelling
menagerie
through
the
country
in
summer
and
the
placing
of
the
wild
animals
in
the
museum
in
winter
the
capital
of
the
company
was
one
million
of
dollars
with
the
privilege
of
doubling
the
amount
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
new
arrangement
it
was
stipulated
that
i
should
withdraw
from
all
active
personal
attention
to
the
museum
but
should
permit
my
name
to
be
announced
as
general
manager
and
i
was
also
elected
president
of
the
company
this
arrangement
gave
me
the
comparative
tranquillity
which
i
now
began
to
desire
i
spent
most
of
my
time
in
bridgeport
except
in
winter
when
i
resided
in
new
york
i
usually
visited
the
museum
about
once
a
week
but
sometimes
was
absent
for
several
months
meanwhile
immense
additions
were
made
to
the
curiosity
departments
of
the
new
museum
every
penny
of
the
profits
of
this
museum
and
of
the
two
immense
travelling
menageries
of
wild
animals
was
expended
in
procuring
additional
attractions
for
our
patrons
among
other
valuable
novelties
introduced
in
this
establishment
was
the
famous
collection
made
by
the
renowned
gordon
cummings
this
was
purchased
for
me
by
my
faithful
friend
george
a
wells
who
was
then
travelling
in
great
britain
with
general
tom
thumb
the
collection
consisted
of
many
hundreds
of
skins
tusks
heads
and
skeletons
of
nearly
every
species
of
african
animal
including
numerous
rare
specimens
never
before
exhibited
on
this
continent
it
was
a
great
museum
in
itself
and
as
such
had
attracted
much
attention
in
london
and
elsewhere
but
it
was
a
mere
addition
to
our
museum
and
menagerie
and
was
exhibited
without
extra
charge
for
admission
in
the
summer
of
i
saw
in
several
new
york
papers
a
thrilling
account
of
an
immense
gorilla
which
had
arrived
from
africa
in
charge
of
barnum
s
agent
for
the
barnum
and
van
amburgh
company
the
accounts
described
the
removal
of
the
savage
animal
in
a
strong
iron
cage
from
the
ship
and
his
transportation
up
broadway
to
the
museum
his
cries
and
roarings
were
said
to
have
been
terrible
and
when
he
was
taken
into
the
menagerie
he
was
reported
to
have
bent
the
heavy
iron
bars
of
his
cage
and
in
his
rage
to
have
seized
a
poker
which
was
thrust
at
him
and
to
have
twisted
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
bit
of
wire
nothing
so
startlingly
sensational
in
the
line
of
zoÃ¶logical
description
had
appeared
since
the
famous
report
of
the
burning
of
the
american
museum
in
for
several
years
i
had
been
trying
to
secure
such
an
animal
and
several
african
travellers
had
promised
to
do
their
best
to
procure
one
for
me
and
i
had
offered
as
high
as
for
the
delivery
in
new
york
of
a
healthy
gorilla
from
the
minute
description
now
given
by
the
reporters
i
was
convinced
that
at
last
the
prize
had
been
secured
i
was
greatly
elated
and
at
once
wrote
from
bridgeport
to
our
manager
ferguson
advising
him
how
to
exhibit
the
valuable
animal
and
particularly
how
to
preserve
its
precious
life
as
long
as
might
be
possible
i
have
owned
many
and
all
of
them
die
ultimately
of
pulmonary
disease
indeed
it
is
difficult
to
keep
specimens
of
the
monkey
tribe
through
the
winter
in
our
climate
on
account
of
their
tendency
to
consumption
i
therefore
advised
ferguson
to
have
a
cage
so
constructed
that
no
draught
of
air
could
pass
through
it
and
i
further
instructed
him
in
methods
of
guarding
against
the
gorilla
s
taking
cold
a
few
days
later
i
went
to
new
york
expressly
to
see
the
gorilla
and
on
visiting
the
museum
i
was
vexed
beyond
measure
to
find
that
the
animal
was
simply
a
huge
baboon
he
was
chained
down
so
that
he
could
not
stand
erect
nor
turn
his
back
to
visitors
his
keeper
could
easily
irritate
him
and
when
the
animal
was
excited
he
would
seize
the
iron
bars
with
both
hands
and
uttering
horrid
screams
would
shake
the
cage
so
fiercely
that
it
could
be
heard
and
felt
in
the
adjoining
saloons
no
doubt
many
of
the
visitors
recalled
du
chaillu
s
accounts
of
the
genuine
gorilla
and
were
convinced
that
the
veritable
animal
was
before
them
but
i
had
been
too
long
in
the
business
to
be
caught
by
such
chaff
and
approaching
the
keeper
i
asked
him
why
he
did
not
lengthen
the
chain
so
that
the
animal
could
stand
up
because
if
i
do
he
will
show
his
tail
the
keeper
confidentially
whispered
in
my
ear
the
imposition
was
so
silly
and
transparent
that
i
did
not
care
how
soon
it
was
exposed
as
usual
however
i
looked
at
the
funny
side
of
the
matter
and
immediately
enclosed
a
ticket
to
my
friend
paul
du
chaillu
who
was
then
stopping
at
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
at
the
same
time
writing
to
the
great
african
traveller
that
much
as
he
had
done
the
barnum
and
van
amburgh
company
had
done
more
since
he
had
only
killed
gorillas
while
we
had
secured
a
living
one
and
brought
the
monster
safely
from
africa
to
america
i
informed
him
moreover
that
all
the
gorillas
he
had
seen
and
described
were
tailless
while
our
far
more
remarkable
specimen
had
a
tail
full
four
feet
long
du
chaillu
came
into
the
museum
that
afternoon
in
great
glee
with
my
open
letter
in
his
hand
ah
barnum
he
exclaimed
this
is
the
funniest
letter
i
ever
received
of
course
you
know
your
gorilla
is
no
gorilla
at
all
but
only
a
baboon
i
will
not
look
at
him
for
when
people
ask
me
about
barnum
s
gorilla
i
prefer
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
have
not
seen
on
the
contrary
said
i
i
particularly
desire
that
you
should
see
the
animal
and
expose
it
the
imposition
is
too
true
but
i
think
your
letter
is
more
curious
than
your
then
i
give
you
full
leave
to
read
the
letter
to
all
who
ask
you
about
the
thank
you
said
du
chaillu
and
i
wish
you
would
let
me
read
it
in
my
lectures
at
the
west
where
i
am
soon
going
on
a
i
consented
that
he
should
do
so
and
i
afterwards
heard
that
he
was
delighting
as
well
as
enlightening
western
audiences
on
the
subject
of
manager
ferguson
s
management
of
the
great
gorilla
in
the
barnum
and
van
amburgh
museum
and
menagerie
the
menagerie
of
living
animals
was
superior
in
extent
to
any
other
similar
collection
in
america
embracing
as
it
did
almost
every
description
of
wild
animal
ever
exhibited
including
the
smallest
african
elephant
and
the
only
living
giraffe
then
in
the
united
states
the
collection
of
lions
and
royal
bengal
tigers
was
superb
there
was
a
cage
full
of
young
lions
that
attracted
great
attention
and
the
whole
menagerie
was
an
exceedingly
valuable
one
when
i
say
that
to
these
attractions
was
added
an
able
dramatic
company
which
performed
every
afternoon
and
evening
and
that
the
admission
to
the
entire
establishment
was
but
thirty
cents
with
no
extra
charge
except
for
a
few
front
seats
and
private
boxes
it
is
no
wonder
that
this
immense
building
five
stories
high
and
covering
ground
by
two
hundred
feet
in
area
was
thronged
from
sunrise
to
ten
and
from
top
to
bottom
with
country
and
city
visitors
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
the
public
was
soon
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
facts
first
that
never
before
was
such
an
outlay
made
for
so
great
an
assemblage
of
useful
and
amusing
attractions
combining
instruction
with
amusement
and
thrown
open
to
the
people
at
so
small
a
charge
for
admission
and
second
that
the
surest
way
of
deriving
the
greatest
profit
in
the
long
run
is
to
give
people
as
much
as
possible
for
their
money
that
these
facts
were
fully
impressed
upon
our
patrons
is
instanced
in
the
monthly
returns
made
to
the
united
states
collector
of
internal
revenue
for
the
district
which
showed
that
our
receipts
were
larger
than
those
of
wallack
s
theatre
niblo
s
garden
or
any
other
theatre
or
place
of
amusement
in
new
york
or
in
america
anxious
to
gather
curiosities
from
every
quarter
of
the
globe
i
sent
john
greenwood
junior
who
went
for
me
to
the
isle
of
cyprus
and
to
constantinople
in
on
the
quaker
city
excursion
which
left
new
york
june
and
returned
in
the
following
november
during
his
absence
greenwood
travelled
miles
and
brought
back
several
interesting
relics
from
the
holy
land
which
were
duly
deposited
in
the
museum
very
soon
after
entering
upon
the
premises
i
built
a
new
and
larger
lecture
room
which
was
one
of
the
most
commodious
and
complete
theatres
in
new
york
and
i
largely
increased
the
dramatic
company
our
collection
swelled
so
rapidly
that
we
were
obliged
to
extend
our
premises
by
the
addition
of
another
building
forty
by
one
hundred
feet
adjoining
the
museum
this
addition
gave
us
several
new
halls
which
were
speedily
filled
with
curiosities
the
rapid
expansion
of
the
establishment
and
the
immense
interest
excited
in
the
public
mind
led
me
to
consider
a
plan
i
had
long
contemplated
of
taking
some
decided
steps
towards
the
foundation
of
a
great
free
institution
which
should
be
similar
to
and
in
some
respects
superior
to
the
british
museum
in
london
the
barnum
and
van
amburgh
museum
and
menagerie
company
chartered
with
a
capital
of
had
in
addition
to
the
new
york
establishment
thirty
acres
of
land
in
bridgeport
whereon
it
was
proposed
to
erect
suitable
buildings
and
glass
and
wire
edifices
for
breeding
and
acclimating
rare
animals
and
birds
and
training
such
of
them
as
were
fit
for
public
performances
in
time
a
new
building
in
new
york
covering
a
whole
square
and
farther
up
town
would
be
needed
for
the
mammoth
exhibition
and
i
was
not
with
out
hopes
that
i
might
be
the
means
of
establishing
permanently
in
the
city
an
extensive
zoÃ¶logical
garden
it
was
also
my
intention
ultimately
to
make
my
museum
the
nucleus
of
a
great
free
national
institution
when
the
american
museum
was
burned
and
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
collection
of
fresh
curiosities
i
felt
that
i
needed
other
assistance
than
that
of
my
own
agents
in
america
and
europe
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
our
government
representatives
abroad
would
but
use
their
influence
to
secure
curiosities
in
the
respective
countries
to
which
they
were
delegated
a
free
public
museum
might
at
once
be
begun
in
new
york
and
i
proposed
to
offer
a
part
of
my
own
establishment
for
the
deposit
and
exhibition
of
such
rarities
as
might
be
collected
in
this
way
accordingly
a
week
after
the
destruction
of
the
american
museum
a
memorial
was
addressed
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
asking
him
to
give
his
sanction
to
the
new
effort
to
furnish
the
means
of
useful
information
and
wholesome
amusement
and
to
give
such
instructions
to
public
officers
abroad
as
would
enable
them
without
any
conflict
with
their
legitimate
duties
to
give
efficiency
to
this
truly
national
movement
for
the
advancement
of
the
public
good
without
cost
to
the
government
this
memorial
was
dated
july
and
was
signed
by

andrew
i
went
to
washington
myself
and
had
interviews
with
the
president
secretaries
seward
mcculloch
and
welles
and
also
with
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
fox
who
gave
me
several
muskets
and
other
rebel
during
my
stay
at
the
capital
i
had
a
pleasant
interview
with
general
grant
who
told
me
he
had
lately
visited
my
museum
with
one
of
his
sons
and
had
been
greatly
gratified
upon
my
mentioning
among
other
projects
that
i
had
an
idea
of
collecting
the
hats
of
distinguished
individuals
he
at
once
offered
to
send
an
orderly
for
the
hat
he
had
worn
during
his
principal
campaigns
all
these
gentlemen
cordially
approved
of
my
plan
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
museum
in
new
york
but
before
this
plan
could
be
put
into
effective
operation
an
event
occurred
which
is
now
to
be
narrated
the
winter
of
was
one
of
the
coldest
that
had
been
known
for
years
and
some
thirty
severe
snowstorms
occurred
during
the
season
on
tuesday
morning
march
it
was
bitter
cold
a
heavy
body
of
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
as
i
sat
at
the
breakfast
table
with
my
wife
and
an
esteemed
lady
guest
the
wife
of
my
excellent
friend
rev
thomas
i
read
aloud
the
general
news
from
the
morning
papers
leisurely
turning
to
the
local
columns
i
said
hallo
barnum
s
museum
is
yes
said
my
wife
with
an
incredulous
smile
i
suspect
it
it
is
a
fact
said
i
just
listen
barnum
s
museum
totally
destroyed
by
this
was
read
so
coolly
and
i
showed
so
little
excitement
that
both
of
the
ladies
supposed
i
was
joking
my
wife
simply
remarked
yes
it
was
totally
destroyed
two
years
ago
but
barnum
built
another
yes
and
that
is
burned
i
replied
now
listen
and
i
proceeded
very
calmly
to
read
the
account
of
the
fire
thomas
still
believing
from
my
manner
that
it
was
a
joke
stole
slyly
behind
my
chair
and
looking
over
my
shoulder
at
the
newspaper
she
exclaimed
why
barnum
the
museum
is
really
burned
here
is
the
whole
account
of
it
in
this
morning
s
of
course
it
is
i
remarked
with
a
smile
how
could
you
think
i
could
joke
on
such
a
serious
subject
it
was
indeed
too
true
and
the
subject
was
no
doubt
serious
enough
in
fact
the
pecuniary
blow
was
perhaps
even
heavier
than
the
loss
of
the
other
museum
especially
as
there
was
probably
no
bennett
around
who
would
give
me
for
a
lease
but
during
my
whole
life
i
had
been
so
much
accustomed
to
operations
of
magnitude
for
or
against
my
interests
that
large
losses
or
gains
were
not
apt
to
disturb
my
tranquillity
indeed
my
second
daughter
calling
in
soon
after
and
seeing
how
coolly
i
took
the
disaster
said
that
her
husband
had
remarked
that
morning
your
father
wont
care
half
so
much
about
it
as
he
would
if
his
pocket
had
been
picked
of
fifty
dollars
that
would
have
vexed
him
but
he
will
take
this
heavier
loss
as
simply
the
fortune
of
and
this
was
very
nearly
the
fact
yet
the
loss
was
a
large
one
and
the
complete
frustration
of
our
plans
for
the
future
was
a
serious
consideration
but
worse
than
all
were
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
wild
animals
which
were
burned
to
death
in
their
cages
a
very
few
only
of
these
animals
were
saved
even
the
people
who
were
sleeping
in
the
building
barely
escaped
with
their
lives
and
next
to
nothing
else
so
sudden
was
the
fire
and
so
rapid
its
progress
the
papers
of
the
following
morning
contained
full
accounts
of
the
fire
and
editorial
writers
while
manifesting
much
sympathy
for
the
proprietors
also
expressed
profound
regret
that
so
magnificent
a
collection
especially
in
the
zoÃ¶logical
department
should
be
lost
to
the
city
the
cold
was
so
intense
that
the
water
froze
almost
as
soon
as
it
left
the
hose
of
the
fire
engines
and
when
at
last
everything
was
destroyed
except
the
front
granite
wall
of
the
museum
building
that
and
the
ladder
signs
and
in
front
were
covered
in
a
gorgeous
of
transparent
ice
which
made
it
altogether
one
of
the
most
picturesque
scenes
imaginable
thousands
of
persons
congregated
daily
in
that
locality
in
order
to
get
a
view
of
the
magnificent
ruins
by
moonlight
the
ruins
were
still
more
sublime
and
for
many
days
and
nights
the
old
museum
was
the
observed
of
all
observers
and
photographs
were
taken
by
several
artists
when
the
museum
was
burnt
i
was
nearly
ready
to
bring
out
a
new
spectacle
for
which
a
very
large
extra
company
had
been
engaged
and
on
which
a
considerable
sum
of
money
had
been
expended
in
scenery
properties
costumes
and
especially
in
enlarging
the
stage
i
had
expended
altogether
some
in
building
the
new
and
in
refitting
the
saloons
the
curiosities
were
inventoried
by
the
manager
ferguson
at
i
bought
the
real
estate
only
a
little
while
before
the
fire
for
and
there
was
an
insurance
on
the
whole
of
and
in
june
i
sold
the
lots
on
which
the
building
stood
for
the
cause
of
the
fire
was
a
defective
flue
in
a
restaurant
in
the
basement
of
the
building
thus
by
the
destruction
of
iranistan
and
two
museums
about
a
million
of
dollars
worth
of
my
property
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
and
i
was
not
now
long
in
making
up
my
mind
to
follow
greeley
s
advice
on
a
former
occasion
to
take
this
fire
as
a
notice
to
quit
and
go
we
all
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
person
to
stop
when
he
is
engaged
in
business
and
how
seldom
it
is
that
we
find
a
man
who
thinks
he
has
accumulated
money
enough
and
is
willing
to
cease
trying
to
make
illustration
the
more
an
active
business
life
like
everything
else
becomes
a
habit
and
the
strife
for
success
in
business
through
all
the
changes
of
fortune
and
ups
and
downs
of
trade
becomes
an
infatuation
akin
to
that
which
spurs
the
gambler
hence
men
often
pursue
their
occupations
long
after
the
necessity
therefor
has
ceased
of
course
by
wedding
themselves
to
this
one
ambition
they
forego
many
of
the
higher
pleasures
of
life
and
though
they
have
a
vague
idea
of
that
good
time
coming
when
they
are
going
to
take
things
easy
and
enjoy
themselves
that
time
never
comes
men
who
are
entirely
idle
are
the
most
miserable
creatures
in
the
world
but
when
by
arduous
toil
they
have
secured
a
competence
and
especially
when
they
have
reached
a
point
in
life
where
they
are
conscious
of
a
waning
of
their
vital
energies
we
must
admit
that
they
are
unwise
if
they
do
not
slip
out
of
active
business
and
devote
a
large
portion
of
their
time
to
intellectual
pursuits
social
enjoyments
and
if
they
have
not
done
so
through
life
to
serious
reflections
on
the
ends
and
aims
of
human
existence
it
is
perhaps
possible
that
notwithstanding
the
active
life
i
have
led
i
have
after
all
a
lazy
streak
in
my
composition
at
all
events
i
confess
it
was
with
no
small
degree
of
satisfaction
that
by
this
last
burning
of
the
museum
notwithstanding
the
serious
pecuniary
loss
it
proved
to
me
i
discovered
a
way
open
through
which
i
could
retire
to
a
more
quiet
and
tranquil
mode
of
life
i
therefore
at
once
dissolved
with
the
van
amburgh
company
and
sold
out
to
them
all
my
interest
in
the
personal
property
of
the
concern
i
was
however
beset
on
every
side
to
start
another
museum
and
men
of
capital
offered
to
raise
a
million
of
dollars
if
necessary
for
that
purpose
provided
i
would
undertake
its
management
my
constant
reply
was
lead
me
not
into
i
felt
that
i
had
enough
to
live
on
and
i
earnestly
believed
the
doctrine
laid
down
in
my
lecture
on
money
getting
in
regard
to
the
danger
of
leaving
too
much
property
to
children
as
i
now
had
something
like
real
leisure
at
my
disposal
in
the
summer
of
i
made
my
third
visit
to
the
white
mountains
to
me
the
locality
and
scene
are
ever
fresh
and
ever
wonderful
from
the
top
of
mount
washington
one
can
see
on
every
side
within
a
radius
of
forty
miles
peaks
piled
on
peaks
with
smiling
valleys
here
and
there
between
and
on
a
very
clear
day
the
atlantic
ocean
off
portland
maine
is
distinctly
visible
sixty
miles
away
beauty
grandeur
sublimity
and
the
satisfaction
of
almost
every
sense
combine
to
remind
one
of
the
ejaculation
of
that
devout
english
soul
who
exclaims
look
around
with
pleasure
and
upward
with
at
the
profile
house
near
the
notch
in
the
franconia
range
i
met
many
acquaintances
some
of
whom
had
been
there
with
their
families
for
several
weeks
when
tired
of
and
and
thrown
entirely
upon
their
own
resources
they
had
invented
a
sell
which
they
perpetrated
upon
every
naturally
enough
as
i
was
considered
a
capital
subject
for
their
fun
before
i
had
been
there
half
an
hour
they
had
made
all
the
arrangements
to
take
me
in
the
sell
consisted
in
getting
up
a
footrace
in
which
all
were
to
join
and
at
the
word
go
the
contestants
were
to
start
and
run
across
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
hotel
to
a
fence
opposite
while
the
last
man
who
should
touch
the
rail
must
treat
the
crowd
illustration
five
seconds
of
course
no
one
touched
the
rail
at
all
except
the
victim
i
suspected
no
trick
but
tried
to
avoid
the
race
urging
in
excuse
that
i
was
too
old
too
corpulent
and
besides
as
they
knew
i
was
a
teetotaler
and
would
not
drink
their
liquor
oh
drink
lemonade
if
you
like
they
said
but
no
backing
out
and
as
for
corpulence
here
is
stephen
our
old
who
weighs
three
hundred
and
he
shall
run
with
the
and
in
good
truth
stephen
in
a
warm
day
especially
would
be
likely
to
run
with
the
best
of
them
but
i
did
not
know
then
that
stephen
was
the
whom
they
kept
to
entrap
unwary
and
verdant
youths
like
myself
so
looking
at
his
portly
form
i
at
once
agreed
that
if
stephen
ran
i
would
as
i
knew
that
for
a
stout
man
i
was
pretty
quick
on
my
feet
accordingly
at
the
word
go
i
started
and
ran
as
if
the
traditional
enemy
of
mankind
were
in
me
or
after
me
but
before
i
had
accomplished
half
the
distance
i
wondered
why
at
least
one
or
two
of
the
crowd
had
not
outstripped
me
for
in
fact
stephen
was
the
only
one
whom
i
expected
to
beat
looking
back
and
at
once
comprehending
the
sell
i
decided
not
to
be
sold
a
correspondent
of
the
new
york
told
how
i
escaped
the
trick
and
the
penalty
and
how
i
subsequently
paid
off
the
tricksters
in
a
letter
from
which
i
quote
the
following
barnum
threw
up
his
hands
before
arriving
at
the
railing
and
did
not
touch
it
at
all
it
was
acknowledged
on
all
sides
that
the
biters
were
but
you
ran
well
said
those
who
intended
the
yes
replied
barnum
in
high
glee
i
ran
better
than
i
did
for
congress
but
i
was
not
green
enough
to
touch
the
rail
of
course
a
roar
of
laughter
followed
and
the
sellers
resolved
to
try
the
game
the
next
morning
on
some
other
but
their
luck
had
evidently
deserted
them
for
the
next
man
also
smelt
a
rat
and
holding
up
his
hands
refused
to
touch
the
rail
the
two
successive
failures
dampened
the
ardor
of
the
sellers
and
they
relinquished
that
trick
as
a
bad
job
but
the
way
barnum
sold
nearly
the
whole
crowd
of
sellers
in
detail
on
the
following
afternoon
by
the
old
sliver
trick
was
a
caution
to
sore
sides
so
much
laughing
in
one
day
was
probably
never
before
done
in
that
locality
one
after
another
succeeded
in
extracting
from
the
palm
of
barnum
s
hand
what
each
at
first
supposed
was
a
tormenting
sliver
but
which
turned
out
to
be
a
broom
splinter
a
foot
long
which
was
hidden
up
s
sleeve
except
the
small
point
which
appeared
from
under
the
end
of
his
thumb
apparently
protruding
from
under
the
skin
of
his
palm
one
weak
brother
nearly
fainted
as
he
saw
come
forth
some
twelve
inches
of
what
he
at
first
supposed
was
a
sliver
but
which
he
was
now
thoroughly
convinced
was
one
of
the
nerves
from
barnum
s
arm
o
brien
the
wall
street
banker
was
the
first
victim
when
asked
what
he
thought
upon
seeing
such
a
long
sliver
coming
from
barnum
s
hand
he
solemnly
replied
i
thought
he
was
a
dead
man
it
was
acknowledged
by
all
that
barnum
gave
them
a
world
of
fun
and
that
he
and
his
friends
left
the
profile

during

george
wood
a
most
successful
and
enterprising
manager
had
been
engaged
in
enlarging
and
refitting
banvard
s
building
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
thirteenth
street
for
a
museum
and
theatre
and
wishing
to
avoid
my
competition
in
the
business
he
proposed
that
for
a
consideration
to
be
governed
to
some
degree
by
the
receipts
i
should
bind
myself
to
have
no
other
interest
in
any
museum
or
place
of
amusement
in
new
york
and
that
i
should
give
him
the
benefit
of
my
experience
influence
and
information
and
thus
aid
in
advancing
his
interests
and
in
building
up
and
carrying
out
his
enterprise
his
proposition
fully
met
my
views
and
i
accepted
it
without
incurring
risk
or
responsibility
i
could
occupy
portions
of
my
time
which
otherwise
perhaps
might
drag
heavily
on
my
hands
my
mind
especially
would
be
employed
in
matters
with
which
i
was
familiar
and
i
might
gratify
my
desire
to
assist
in
catering
to
the
healthful
wholesome
amusement
of
the
rising
generation
and
the
public
i
should
not
rust
out
and
moreover
the
new
museum
would
afford
me
a
pleasant
place
to
drop
into
when
i
felt
inclined
to
do
so
nothing
in
this
arrangement
compelled
my
presence
in
new
york
or
even
in
the
united
states
i
could
go
when
and
where
i
chose
and
could
continue
to
be
as
i
hope
to
be
for
the
rest
of
my
life
a
man
of
leisure
which
in
my
case
and
according
to
my
construction
is
far
from
being
a
man
of
idleness
while
i
was
at
the
white
mountains
i
received
a
telegram
from
george
wood
stating
that
he
could
not
consider
his
list
of
curiosities
complete
unless
i
would
consent
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
his
museum
and
i
accordingly
waived
all
my
chances
in
any
intended
foot
races
and
hastened
to

our
servants
might
not
like
to
go
on
friday
remarked
what
nonsense
that
is
it
is
astonishing
that
some
persons
are
so
foolish
as
to
think
there
is
any
difference
in
the
days
i
call
it
rank
heathenism
to
be
so
superstitious
as
to
think
one
day
is
lucky
and
another
unlucky
and
then
in
the
most
innocent
manner
possible
she
added
i
would
not
like
to
remove
on
a
saturday
myself
for
they
say
people
who
remove
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
don
t
stay
of
course
this
was
too
refreshing
a
case
of
undoubted
superstition
to
be
permitted
to
pass
without
a
hearty
laugh
from
all
who
heard
it
i
suppose
most
of
us
have
certain
superstitions
imbibed
in
our
youth
and
still
lurking
more
or
less
faintly
in
our
minds
many
would
not
like
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
any
choice
whether
they
commenced
a
new
enterprise
on
a
friday
or
on
a
monday
or
whether
they
first
saw
the
new
moon
over
the
right
or
left
shoulder
and
yet
perhaps
a
large
portion
of
these
same
persons
will
be
apt
to
observe
it
when
they
happen
to
do
anything
which
popular
superstition
calls
it
is
a
common
occurrence
with
many
to
immediately
make
a
secret
wish
if
they
happen
to
use
the
same
expression
at
the
same
moment
when
a
friend
with
whom
they
are
conversing
makes
it
nevertheless
these
persons
would
protest
against
being
considered
superstitious
indeed
probably
they
are
not
so
in
the
full
meaning
of
the
word
several
years
ago
an
old
lady
who
was
a
guest
at
my
house
remarked
on
a
rainy
sunday
this
is
the
first
sunday
in
the
month
and
now
it
will
rain
every
sunday
in
the
month
that
is
a
sign
which
never
fails
for
i
have
noticed
it
many
a
well
i
remarked
smiling
watch
closely
this
time
and
if
it
rains
on
the
next
three
sundays
i
will
give
you
a
new
silk
she
was
in
high
glee
and
replied
well
you
have
lost
that
dress
as
sure
as
you
are
the
following
sunday
it
did
indeed
rain
ah
ha
exclaimed
the
old
lady
what
did
i
tell
you
i
knew
it
would
i
smiled
and
said
all
right
watch
for
next
and
surely
enough
the
next
sunday
it
did
rain
harder
than
on
either
of
the
preceding
sundays
now
what
do
you
think
said
the
old
lady
solemnly
i
tell
you
that
sign
never
fails
it
wont
do
to
doubt
the
ways
of
providence
she
added
with
a
sigh
for
his
ways
are
mysterious
and
past
finding
the
following
sunday
the
sun
rose
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
not
the
slightest
appearance
of
rain
was
manifested
through
the
day
the
old
lady
was
greatly
disappointed
and
did
not
like
to
hear
any
allusion
to
the
subject
but
two
years
afterwards
when
she
was
once
more
my
guest
it
again
happened
to
rain
on
the
first
sunday
in
the
month
and
i
heard
her
solemnly
predict
that
it
would
every
succeeding
sunday
in
the
month
for
she
remarked
it
is
a
sign
that
never
she
had
forgotten
the
failure
of
two
years
before
indeed
the
continuance
and
prevalence
of
many
popular
superstitions
is
due
to
the
fact
that
we
notice
the
sign
when
it
happens
to
be
verified
and
do
not
observe
it
or
we
forget
it
when
it
fails
many
persons
are
exceedingly
superstitious
in
regard
to
the
number
this
is
particularly
the
case
i
have
noticed
in
catholic
countries
i
have
visited
and
i
have
been
told
that
superstition
originated
in
the
fact
of
a
thirteenth
apostle
having
been
chosen
on
account
of
the
treachery
of
judas
at
any
rate
i
have
known
numbers
of
french
persons
who
had
quite
a
horror
of
this
fatal
number
once
i
knew
a
french
lady
who
had
taken
passage
in
an
ocean
steamer
and
who
on
going
aboard
and
finding
her
assigned
to
be
no
insisted
upon
it
that
she
would
not
sail
in
the
ship
at
all
she
had
rather
forfeit
her
passage
money
though
finally
she
was
persuaded
to
take
another
room
and
a
great
many
people
french
english
and
american
will
not
undertake
any
important
enterprise
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
month
nor
sit
at
table
with
the
full
complement
of
thirteen
persons
with
regard
to
this
number
to
which
so
many
superstitions
cling
i
have
some
interesting
experiences
and
curious
coincidences
which
are
worth
relating
as
a
part
of
my
personal
history
when
i
was
first
in
england
with
general
tom
thumb
i
well
remember
dining
one
christmas
day
with
my
friends
the
brettells
in
james
s
palace
in
london
just
before
the
dinner
was
finished
it
is
a
wonder
it
was
not
noticed
before
it
was
discovered
that
the
number
at
table
was
exactly
thirteen
how
very
unfortunate
remarked
one
of
the
guests
i
would
not
have
dined
under
such
circumstances
for
any
consideration
had
i
known
it
nor
i
either
seriously
remarked
another
guest
do
you
really
suppose
there
is
any
truth
in
the
old
superstition
on
that
subject
i
asked
truth
solemnly
replied
an
old
lady
truth
why
i
myself
have
known
three
instances
and
have
heard
of
scores
of
others
where
thirteen
persons
have
eaten
at
the
same
table
and
in
every
case
one
of
the
number
died
before
the
year
was
out
this
assertion
made
with
so
much
earnestness
evidently
affected
several
of
the
guests
whose
nerves
were
easily
excited
i
can
truthfully
state
however
that
i
dined
at
the
palace
again
the
following
christmas
and
although
there
were
seventeen
persons
present
every
one
of
the
original
thirteen
who
dined
there
the
preceding
christmas
was
among
this
number
and
all
in
good
health
although
of
course
it
would
have
been
nothing
very
remarkable
if
one
had
happened
to
have
died
during
the
last
twelve
months
while
i
was
on
my
western
lecturing
tour
in
long
before
i
got
out
of
illinois
i
began
to
observe
that
at
the
various
hotels
where
i
stopped
my
room
very
frequently
was
no
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
this
number
turned
up
to
me
as
often
as
four
times
per
week
and
so
before
many
days
i
almost
expected
to
have
that
number
set
down
to
my
name
wherever
i
signed
it
upon
the
register
of
the
hotel
still
i
laughed
to
myself
at
what
i
was
convinced
was
simply
a
coincidence
on
one
occasion
i
was
travelling
from
clinton
to
mount
vernon
iowa
and
was
to
lecture
in
the
college
of
the
latter
place
that
evening
ordinarily
i
should
have
arrived
at
two
o
clock
but
owing
to
an
accident
which
had
occurred
to
the
train
from
the
west
the
conductor
informed
me
that
our
arrival
in
mount
vernon
would
probably
be
delayed
until
after
seven
o
clock
i
telegraphed
that
fact
to
the
committee
who
were
expecting
me
and
told
them
to
be
patient
when
we
had
arrived
within
ten
miles
of
that
town
it
was
dark
i
sat
rather
moodily
in
the
car
wishing
the
train
would
hurry
up
and
happening
for
some
cause
to
look
back
over
my
left
shoulder
i
discovered
the
new
moon
through
the
window
this
omen
struck
me
as
a
coincident
addition
to
my
and
with
a
pleasant
chuckle
i
muttered
to
myself
well
i
hope
i
wont
get
room
number
thirteen
for
that
will
be
adding
insult
to
i
reached
mount
vernon
a
few
minutes
before
eight
and
was
met
at
the
depot
by
the
committee
who
took
me
in
a
carriage
and
hurried
to
the
ballard
house
the
committee
told
me
the
hall
in
the
college
was
already
crowded
and
they
hoped
i
would
defer
taking
tea
until
after
the
lecture
i
informed
them
that
i
would
gladly
do
so
but
simply
wished
to
run
to
my
room
a
moment
for
a
wash
while
wiping
my
face
i
happened
to
think
about
the
new
room
and
at
once
stepped
outside
of
my
door
to
look
at
the
number
it
was
number
after
the
lecture
i
took
tea
and
i
confess
that
i
began
to
think
number
thirteen
looked
a
little
ominous
there
i
was
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
my
family
i
left
my
wife
sick
and
i
began
to
ask
myself
does
number
thirteen
portend
anything
in
particular
without
feeling
willing
even
now
to
acknowledge
that
i
felt
much
apprehension
on
the
subject
i
must
say
i
began
to
take
a
serious
view
of
things
in
general
i
mentioned
the
coincidence
of
my
luck
in
so
often
having
number
thirteen
assigned
to
me
to
ballard
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
giving
him
all
the
particulars
to
date
i
will
give
you
another
room
if
you
prefer
it
said
ballard
no
i
thank
you
i
replied
with
a
smile
if
it
is
fate
i
will
take
it
as
it
comes
and
if
it
means
anything
i
shall
probably
find
it
out
in
that
same
night
before
retiring
to
rest
i
wrote
a
letter
to
a
clerical
friend
then
residing
in
bridgeport
telling
him
all
my
experiences
in
regard
to
number
i
said
to
him
in
closing
don
t
laugh
at
me
for
being
superstitious
for
i
hardly
feel
so
i
think
it
is
simply
a
series
of
coincidences
which
appear
the
more
strange
because
i
am
sure
to
notice
every
one
that
ten
days
afterwards
i
received
an
answer
from
my
reverend
friend
in
which
he
cheerfully
said
it
s
all
right
go
ahead
and
get
number
thirteen
as
often
as
you
can
it
is
a
lucky
number
and
he
added
unbelieving
and
ungrateful
man
what
is
thirteen
but
the
traditional
baker
s
dozen
indicating
good
measure
pressed
down
shaken
together
and
running
over
as
illustrated
in
your
triumphal
lecturing
tour
by
all
means
insist
upon
having
room
no
at
every
hotel
and
if
the
guests
at
any
meal
be
less
than
that
charmed
complement
send
out
and
compel
somebody
to
come
in
what
do
you
say
respecting
the
thirteen
colonies
any
ill
luck
in
the
number
was
the
patriarch
jacob
afraid
of
it
when
he
adopted
ephraim
and
manasseh
the
two
sons
of
joseph
so
as
to
complete
the
magic
circle
of
thirteen
do
you
not
know
that
chapter
thirteen
of
first
corinthians
is
the
grandest
in
the
bible
with
verse
thirteen
as
the
culmination
of
all
religious
thought
and
can
you
read
verse
thirteen
of
the
fifth
chapter
of
revelation
without
the
highest
rapture
but
my
clerical
friend
had
not
heard
of
a
certain
curious
circumstance
which
occurred
to
me
after
i
had
mailed
my
letter
to
him
and
before
i
received
his
answer
on
leaving
mount
vernon
for
cedar
rapids
the
next
morning
the
landlord
ballard
drove
me
to
the
railroad
depot
as
i
was
stepping
upon
the
cars
ballard
shook
my
hand
and
with
a
laugh
exclaimed
friend
barnum
i
hope
you
wont
get
room
number
thirteen
at
cedar
rapids
i
hope
not
i
replied
earnestly
and
yet
with
a
smile
i
reached
cedar
rapids
in
an
hour
the
lecture
committee
met
and
took
me
to
the
hotel
i
entered
my
name
and
the
landlord
immediately
called
out
to
the
porter
here
john
take
barnum
s
baggage
and
show
him
to
number
thirteen
i
confess
that
when
i
heard
this
i
was
startled
i
remarked
to
the
landlord
that
it
was
certainly
very
singular
but
was
nevertheless
true
that
number
thirteen
seemed
to
be
about
the
only
room
that
i
could
get
in
a
hotel
we
have
a
large
meeting
of
railroad
directors
here
at
present
he
replied
and
number
thirteen
is
the
only
room
unoccupied
in
my
i
proceeded
to
the
room
and
immediately
wrote
to
ballard
at
mount
vernon
assuring
him
that
my
letter
was
written
in
number
thirteen
and
that
this
was
the
only
room
i
could
get
in
the
hotel
during
the
remainder
of
my
journey
i
was
put
into
number
thirteen
so
often
in
the
various
hotels
at
which
i
stopped
that
it
came
to
be
quite
a
matter
of
course
though
occasionally
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
secure
some
other
number
upon
returning
to
new
york
i
related
the
foregoing
adventures
to
my
family
and
told
them
i
was
really
half
afraid
of
number
soon
afterwards
i
telegraphed
to
my
daughter
who
was
boarding
at
the
atlantic
house
in
bridgeport
asking
her
to
engage
a
room
for
me
to
lodge
there
the
next
night
on
my
way
to
boston
mr
hale
said
she
to
the
landlord
father
is
coming
up
will
you
please
reserve
him
a
comfortable
room
certainly
replied
hale
and
he
instantly
ordered
a
fire
in
room
thirteen
i
went
to
boston
and
proceeded
to
lewiston
maine
and
thence
to
lawrence
massachusetts
and
the
hotel
register
there
has
my
name
booked
for
number
my
experience
with
this
number
has
by
no
means
been
confined
to
apartments
in
a
church
in
bridgeport
wanted
to
raise
several
thousand
dollars
in
order
to
get
freed
from
debt
i
subscribed
one
thousand
dollars
by
aid
of
which
they
assured
me
they
would
certainly
raise
enough
to
pay
off
the
debt
a
few
weeks
subsequently
however
one
of
the
brethren
wrote
me
that
they
were
still
six
hundred
dollars
short
with
but
little
prospect
of
getting
it
i
replied
that
i
would
pay
of
the
sum
required
the
brother
soon
afterwards
wrote
me
that
he
had
obtained
the
other
half
and
i
might
forward
him
my
subscription
of
thirteen
hundred
dollars
during
the
same
season
i
attended
a
fair
in
franklin
hall
bridgeport
given
by
a
temperance
organization
two
of
my
little
granddaughters
accompanied
me
and
telling
them
to
select
what
articles
they
desired
i
paid
the
bill
twelve
dollars
and
fifty
cents
whereupon
i
said
to
the
children
i
am
glad
you
did
not
make
it
thirteen
dollars
and
i
will
expend
no
more
here
we
sat
awhile
listening
to
the
music
and
finally
started
for
home
and
as
we
were
going
a
lady
at
one
of
the
stands
near
the
door
called
out
mr
barnum
you
have
not
patronized
me
please
take
a
chance
in
my
certainly
i
replied
give
me
a
i
paid
her
the
price
fifty
cents
and
after
i
arrived
home
i
discovered
that
in
spite
of
my
expressed
determination
to
the
contrary
i
had
expended
exactly
thirteen
dollars
i
invited
a
few
friends
to
a
in
the
summer
of
and
being
determined
the
party
should
not
be
thirteen
i
invited
fifteen
and
they
all
agreed
to
go
of
course
one
man
and
his
wife
were
disappointed
and
could
not
go
and
my
party
numbered
thirteen
at
christmas
in
the
same
year
my
children
and
grandchildren
dined
with
me
and
finding
on
counting
noses
that
they
would
number
the
inevitable
thirteen
i
expressly
arranged
to
have
a
high
chair
placed
at
the
table
and
my
youngest
grandchild
seventeen
months
old
was
placed
in
it
so
that
we
should
number
fourteen
after
the
dinner
was
over
we
discovered
that
my
thompson
had
been
detained
down
town
and
the
number
at
dinner
table
notwithstanding
my
extra
precautions
was
exactly
thirteen
thirteen
was
certainly
an
ominous
number
to
me
in
for
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
july
the
american
museum
was
burned
to
the
ground
while
the
thirteenth
day
of
november
saw
the
opening
of
barnum
s
new
american
museum
which
was
also
subsequently
destroyed
by
fire
having
concluded
this
veritable
history
of
superstitious
coincidences
in
regard
to
thirteen
i
read
it
to
a
clerical
friend
who
happened
to
be
present
and
after
reading
the
manuscript
i
paged
it
when
my
friend
and
i
were
a
little
startled
to
find
that
the
pages
numbered
exactly
thirteen

of
the
the
final
sell
foreign
and
domestic
french
cockneyism
wicked
words
in
exeter
hall
and
now
as
a
traveller
when
almost
home
sits
down
by
the
wayside
to
rest
and
meanwhile
discourses
to
his
companion
about
minor
matters
relating
to
the
journey
or
revives
reminiscenses
of
home
and
foreign
lands
so
i
stop
to
sum
up
in
this
chapter
some
of
the
incidents
and
anecdotes
which
seem
pertinent
to
my
story
the
old
adages
every
man
to
his
vocation
and
nature
will
assert
herself
are
oftentimes
amusingly
illustrated
every
one
knows
the
fable
of
the
man
who
prayed
to
jupiter
to
convert
his
cat
into
a
woman
and
jupiter
kindly
gratified
him
and
the
man
married
the
woman
this
was
well
enough
till
one
night
the
feline
female
heard
a
mouse
scratching
at
the
door
when
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
began
a
vigorous
hunt
to
the
consternation
of
her
husband
if
not
of
the
mouse
something
almost
as
absurd
and
quite
as
illustrative
of
instinct
or
nature
occurred
during
my
management
of
the
museum
i
had
brought
out
a
play
entitled
the
patriot
fathers
or
something
of
the
sort
it
was
patriotic
at
any
rate
and
required
a
great
many
people
who
had
very
little
to
do
excepting
to
dress
group
themselves
and
go
on
and
off
the
stage
at
the
proper
times
demanded
by
the
incidents
or
situations
of
the
play
one
night
i
suddenly
found
myself
short
of
supernumeraries
to
do
these
subordinate
parts
so
i
sent
up
to
centre
market
for
a
supply
of
young
men
who
were
willing
to
be
soldiers
indians
or
anything
else
which
the
exigencies
of
revolutionary
times
not
less
than
my
own
immediate
necessities
demanded
now
it
fortunately
happened
that
an
engine
company
near
by
the
famous
forty
of
days
had
just
returned
from
a
fire
and
my
messenger
proposed
to
these
men
to
come
down
and
help
me
out
of
my
difficulty
the
boys
wanted
no
better
fun
at
least
thirty
of
them
came
headed
by
their
foreman
william
racey
they
were
soon
dressed
one
as
a
woman
a
mother
of
the
revolution
others
as
indians
british
soldiers
hessian
grenadiers
and
continentals
a
very
little
drilling
sufficed
to
put
these
new
recruits
in
order
for
presentation
on
the
stage
for
they
had
little
to
do
but
to
follow
directions
as
to
where
they
must
stand
and
when
they
must
go
on
and
off
numbers
not
talent
were
needed
they
were
apt
pupils
and
did
excellently
well
from
the
start
but
in
the
very
midst
of
one
of
those
convulsions
which
threatened
the
fate
of
the
struggle
for
independence
the
city
hall
bell
sounded
out
the
alarm
for
fire
that
was
enough
racey
shouted
out
on
the
stage
boys
there
s
a
fire
in
the
seventh
put
for
forty
and
the
thirty
incontinently
fled
in
post
haste
for
forty
and
soon
after
appeared
in
the
street
followed
by
a
jeering
cheering
crew
the
most
motley
company
that
ever
dragged
a
fire
engine
through
the
streets
of
new
york
they
were
in
full
costume
as
they
left
the
museum
the
british
troops
the
hessians
in
their
tall
caps
the
indians
in
their
paint
and
feathers
and
even
the
woman
helped
to
drag
the
machine
and
at
the
fire
these
strange
people
including
the
woman
helped
to
man
the
brakes
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
they
succeeded
in
creating
in
the
street
what
i
hoped
they
would
have
done
on
the
stage
a
positive
sensation
i
confess
that
i
am
fond
of
as
well
as
fun
and
i
inherit
this
i
think
from
my
maternal
grandfather
whom
i
have
already
chronicled
in
these
pages
as
a
practical
joker
of
the
old
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
his
peculiar
fondness
for
this
amusement
appears
in
the
following
danbury
and
bethel
were
and
still
are
manufacturing
villages
hats
and
combs
were
the
principal
articles
of
manufacture
the
hatters
and
comb
makers
had
occasion
to
go
to
new
york
every
spring
and
fall
and
they
generally
managed
to
go
in
parties
frequently
taking
in
a
few
outsiders
who
merely
wished
to
visit
the
city
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
they
usually
took
passage
on
board
a
sloop
at
norwalk
and
the
length
of
their
passage
depended
entirely
upon
the
state
of
the
wind
sometimes
the
run
would
be
made
in
eight
hours
and
at
other
times
nearly
as
many
days
were
required
it
however
made
little
difference
with
the
passengers
they
went
in
for
a
spree
and
were
sure
illustration
grotesque
fire
to
have
a
jolly
time
whether
on
land
or
water
they
were
all
fond
of
practical
jokes
and
before
starting
they
usually
entered
into
a
solemn
compact
that
any
man
who
got
angry
at
a
practical
joke
should
forfeit
and
pay
the
sum
of
twenty
dollars
this
agreement
frequently
saved
much
trouble
for
occasionally
an
unexpected
and
rather
severe
trick
would
be
played
off
and
sadly
chafe
the
temper
of
the
victim
upon
one
of
these
occasions
a
party
of
fourteen
men
started
from
bethel
on
a
monday
morning
for
new
york
among
the
number
were
my
grandfather
capt
noah
ferry
benjamin
hoyt
uncle
samuel
taylor
as
he
was
called
by
everybody
eleazer
taylor
and
charles
dart
most
of
these
were
proverbial
jokers
and
it
was
doubly
necessary
to
adopt
the
stipulation
in
regard
to
the
control
of
temper
it
was
therefore
done
in
writing
duly
signed
they
arrived
at
norwalk
monday
afternoon
the
sloop
set
sail
the
same
evening
with
a
fair
prospect
of
reaching
new
york
early
the
next
morning
several
strangers
took
passage
at
norwalk
among
the
rest
a
clergyman
he
soon
found
himself
in
jolly
company
and
attempted
to
keep
aloof
but
they
informed
him
it
was
of
no
use
they
expected
to
reach
new
york
the
next
morning
and
were
determined
to
make
a
night
of
it
so
he
might
as
well
render
himself
agreeable
for
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
his
reverence
remonstrated
at
first
and
talked
about
his
rights
but
he
soon
learned
that
he
was
in
a
company
where
the
rights
of
the
majority
were
in
the
ascendant
so
he
put
a
smooth
face
upon
affairs
and
making
up
his
mind
not
to
retire
that
night
he
soon
engaged
in
conversation
with
several
of
his
the
clergyman
was
a
slim
spare
man
standing
over
six
feet
high
in
his
stockings
of
light
complexion
sandy
hair
and
wearing
a
huge
pair
of
whiskers
some
of
the
passengers
joked
him
upon
the
superfluity
of
hair
upon
his
face
but
he
replied
that
nature
had
placed
it
there
and
although
he
thought
proper
in
accordance
with
modern
custom
to
shave
off
a
portion
of
his
beard
he
considered
it
neither
unmanly
nor
unclerical
to
wear
whiskers
it
seemed
to
be
conceded
that
the
clergyman
had
the
best
of
the
argument
and
the
subject
was
changed
expectation
of
a
speedy
run
to
new
york
was
most
sadly
disappointed
the
vessel
appeared
scarcely
to
move
and
through
long
weary
hours
of
day
and
night
there
was
not
a
ripple
on
the
surface
of
the
water
nevertheless
there
was
merriment
on
board
the
sloop
each
voyager
contributing
good
humor
to
beguile
the
tediousness
of
time
friday
morning
came
but
the
calm
continued
five
days
from
home
and
no
prospect
of
reaching
new
york
we
may
judge
the
appearance
of
the
beards
of
the
passengers
there
was
but
one
razor
in
the
company
it
was
owned
by
my
grandfather
and
he
refused
to
use
it
or
to
suffer
it
to
be
used
we
shall
all
be
shaved
in
new
york
said
he
on
saturday
morning
all
hands
appeared
upon
deck
and
the
sloop
was
becalmed
opposite
sawpits
now
port
chester
this
tried
the
patience
of
the
passengers
sadly
i
expected
to
start
for
home
said
one
i
supposed
all
my
combs
would
have
been
sold
at
auction
on
wednesday
and
yet
here
they
are
on
board
said
another
i
intended
to
have
sold
my
hats
surely
this
week
for
i
have
a
note
to
pay
in
on
monday
added
a
third
i
have
an
appointment
to
preach
in
new
york
this
evening
and
said
the
clergyman
whose
huge
sandy
whiskers
overshadowed
a
face
now
completely
covered
with
a
bright
red
beard
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
well
there
is
no
use
crying
gentlemen
replied
the
captain
it
is
lucky
for
us
that
we
have
chickens
and
eggs
on
freight
or
we
might
have
to
be
put
upon
after
breakfast
the
passengers
who
now
began
to
look
like
barbarians
again
solicited
the
loan
of
my
grandfather
s
razor
no
gentlemen
he
replied
i
insist
that
shaving
is
unhealthy
and
contrary
to
nature
and
i
am
determined
neither
to
shave
myself
nor
loan
my
razor
until
we
reach
new
night
came
and
yet
no
wind
sunday
morning
found
them
in
the
same
position
their
patience
was
well
nigh
exhausted
but
after
breakfast
a
slight
ripple
appeared
it
gradually
increased
and
the
passengers
were
soon
delighted
in
seeing
the
anchor
weighed
and
the
sails
again
set
the
sloop
glided
finely
through
the
water
and
smiles
of
satisfaction
forced
themselves
through
the
swamps
of
bristles
which
covered
the
faces
of
the
passengers
what
time
shall
we
reach
new
york
if
this
breeze
continues
was
the
anxious
inquiry
of
half
a
dozen
passengers
about
two
o
clock
this
afternoon
replied
the
captain
who
now
felt
assured
that
no
calm
would
further
blight
his
prospects
alas
that
will
be
too
late
to
get
shaved
exclaimed
several
voices
the
barber
shops
close
at
and
i
shall
barely
be
in
time
to
preach
my
afternoon
sermon
responded
the
clergyman
mr
taylor
do
be
so
kind
as
to
loan
me
your
shaving
utensils
he
continued
addressing
my
grandfather
the
old
gentleman
then
went
to
his
trunk
and
unlocking
it
he
drew
forth
his
razor
and
strop
the
passengers
pressed
around
him
as
all
were
now
doubly
anxious
for
a
chance
to
shave
themselves
now
gentlemen
said
my
grandfather
i
will
be
fair
with
you
i
did
not
intend
to
lend
my
razor
but
as
we
shall
arrive
too
late
for
the
barbers
you
shall
all
use
it
but
it
is
evident
we
can
not
all
have
time
to
be
shaved
with
one
razor
before
we
reach
new
york
and
as
it
would
be
hard
for
half
of
us
to
walk
on
shore
with
clean
faces
and
leave
the
rest
on
board
waiting
for
their
turn
to
shave
themselves
i
have
hit
upon
a
plan
which
i
am
sure
you
will
all
say
is
just
and
what
is
it
was
the
anxious
inquiry
it
is
that
each
man
shall
shave
one
half
of
his
face
and
pass
the
razor
over
to
the
next
and
when
we
are
all
half
shaved
we
shall
go
on
in
rotation
and
shave
the
other
they
all
agreed
to
this
except
the
clergyman
he
objected
to
appearing
so
ridiculous
upon
the
lord
s
day
whereupon
several
declared
that
any
man
with
such
enormous
reddish
whiskers
must
necessarily
always
look
ridiculous
and
they
insisted
that
if
the
clergyman
used
the
razor
at
all
he
should
shave
off
his
whiskers
my
grandfather
assented
to
this
proposal
and
said
now
gentlemen
as
i
own
the
razor
i
will
begin
and
as
our
reverend
friend
is
in
a
hurry
he
shall
be
next
but
off
shall
come
one
of
his
whiskers
on
the
first
turn
or
he
positively
shall
not
use
my
razor
at
the
clergyman
seeing
there
was
no
use
in
parleying
reluctantly
agreed
to
the
proposition
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
one
side
of
my
grandfather
s
face
and
chin
in
a
straight
line
from
the
middle
of
his
nose
was
shaved
as
close
as
the
back
of
his
hand
while
the
other
looked
like
a
thick
brush
fence
in
a
country
swamp
the
passengers
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
in
which
the
clergyman
irresistibly
joined
and
my
grandfather
handed
the
razor
to
the
clerical
gentleman
the
clergyman
had
already
well
lathered
one
half
of
his
face
and
passed
the
brush
to
the
next
customer
in
a
short
time
the
razor
had
performed
its
work
and
the
clergyman
was
denuded
of
one
whisker
the
left
side
of
his
face
was
as
naked
as
that
of
an
infant
while
from
the
other
cheek
four
inches
of
a
huge
red
whisker
stood
out
in
powerful
contrast
nothing
more
ludicrous
could
well
be
conceived
a
deafening
burst
of
laughter
ensued
and
the
poor
clergyman
slunk
quietly
away
to
wait
an
hour
until
his
turn
should
arrive
to
shave
the
other
portion
of
his
face
the
next
man
went
through
the
same
operation
and
all
the
rest
followed
a
new
laugh
breaking
forth
as
each
customer
handed
over
the
razor
to
the
next
in
turn
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
quarter
every
passenger
on
board
was
half
shaved
it
was
then
proposed
that
all
should
go
upon
deck
and
take
a
drink
before
operations
were
commenced
on
the
other
side
of
their
faces
when
they
all
gathered
upon
the
deck
the
scene
was
most
ludicrous
the
whole
party
burst
again
into
loud
merriment
each
man
being
convulsed
by
the
ridiculous
appearance
of
the
rest
now
gentlemen
said
my
grandfather
i
will
go
into
the
cabin
and
shave
off
the
other
side
you
can
all
remain
on
deck
as
soon
as
i
have
finished
i
will
come
up
and
give
the
clergyman
the
next
you
must
hurry
or
you
will
not
all
be
finished
when
we
arrive
remarked
the
captain
for
we
shall
touch
peck
slip
wharf
in
half
an
my
grandfather
entered
the
cabin
and
in
ten
minutes
he
appeared
upon
deck
razor
in
hand
he
was
smoothly
shaved
now
said
the
clergyman
it
is
my
certainly
said
my
grandfather
you
are
next
but
wait
a
moment
let
me
draw
the
razor
across
the
strop
once
or
putting
his
foot
upon
the
side
rail
of
the
deck
and
placing
one
end
of
the
strop
upon
his
leg
he
drew
the
razor
several
times
across
it
then
as
if
by
mistake
the
razor
flew
from
his
hand
and
dropped
into
the
water
my
grandfather
with
surprise
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
terror
good
heavens
the
razor
has
fallen
overboard
such
a
picture
of
consternation
as
covered
of
all
the
passengers
faces
was
never
before
witnessed
at
first
they
were
perfectly
silent
as
if
petrified
with
astonishment
but
in
a
few
minutes
murmurs
began
to
be
heard
and
soon
swelled
into
exclamations
an
infernal
hog
said
one
the
meanest
thing
i
ever
knew
remarked
another
he
ought
to
be
thrown
overboard
himself
cried
several
others
but
all
remembered
that
every
man
who
got
angry
was
to
pay
a
fine
of
twenty
dollars
and
they
did
not
repeat
their
remarks
presently
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
clergyman
he
was
the
most
forlorn
picture
of
despair
that
could
be
imagined
illustration
oh
this
is
dreadful
he
drawled
in
a
tone
which
seemed
as
if
every
word
broke
a
this
was
too
much
and
the
whole
crowd
broke
into
another
roar
tranquillity
was
restored
the
joke
though
a
hard
one
was
swallowed
the
sloop
soon
touched
the
dock
the
passengers
now
agreed
that
my
grandfather
who
was
the
only
person
on
board
who
appeared
like
a
civilized
being
should
take
the
lead
for
the
walton
house
in
franklin
square
and
all
the
rest
should
follow
in
indian
he
reminded
them
that
they
would
excite
much
attention
in
the
streets
and
enjoined
them
not
to
smile
they
agreed
and
away
they
started
they
attracted
a
crowd
of
persons
before
they
reached
the
corner
of
pearl
street
and
peck
slip
but
they
all
marched
with
as
much
solemnity
as
if
they
were
going
to
the
grave
the
door
of
the
walton
house
was
open
old
backus
the
landlord
was
quietly
enjoying
his
cigar
while
a
dozen
or
two
persons
were
engaged
in
reading
the
papers
etc
in
marched
the
file
of
nondescripts
with
the
rabble
at
their
heels
backus
and
his
customers
started
to
their
feet
in
astonishment
my
grandfather
marched
solemnly
up
to
the
bar
the
passengers
followed
and
formed
double
rows
behind
him
santa
cruz
rum
for
nineteen
exclaimed
my
grandfather
to
the
barkeeper
the
astonished
produced
bottles
and
tumblers
in
time
and
when
backus
discovered
that
the
nondescripts
were
old
friends
and
customers
he
was
excited
to
uncontrollable
merriment
what
in
the
name
of
decency
has
happened
he
exclaimed
that
you
should
all
appear
here
half
shaved
nothing
at
all
backus
said
my
grandfather
with
apparent
seriousness
these
gentlemen
choose
to
wear
their
beards
according
to
the
prevailing
fashion
in
the
place
they
came
from
and
i
think
it
is
very
hard
that
they
should
be
stared
at
and
insulted
by
you
yorkers
because
fashion
happens
to
differ
a
trifle
from
backus
half
believed
my
grandfather
in
earnest
and
the
bystanders
were
quite
convinced
such
was
the
fact
for
not
a
smile
appeared
upon
one
of
the
countenances
after
sitting
a
few
minutes
the
passengers
were
shown
to
their
rooms
and
at
every
man
appeared
at
the
table
precisely
as
he
came
from
the
sloop
the
ladies
looked
astonished
the
waiters
winked
and
laughed
but
the
subjects
of
this
merriment
were
as
grave
as
judges
in
the
evening
they
maintained
the
same
gravity
in
the
and
at
ten
o
clock
they
retired
to
bed
with
all
due
solemnity
in
the
morning
however
bright
and
early
they
were
in
the
barber
s
shop
undergoing
an
operation
that
soon
placed
them
upon
a
footing
with
the
rest
of
mankind
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
explain
that
the
clergyman
did
not
appear
in
that
singular
procession
of
sunday
afternoon
he
tied
a
handkerchief
over
his
face
and
taking
his
valise
in
his
hand
started
for
market
street
where
it
is
presumed
he
found
a
good
brother
and
a
good
razor
in
season
to
fill
his
appointment
let
me
give
an
illustration
of
a
practical
joke
which
is
quite
professional
as
well
as
practical
with
the
operator
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
no
doubt
profitable
withal
when
i
was
in
paris
in
there
came
one
day
to
my
room
in
the
hotel
bedford
where
i
was
staying
a
smart
little
frenchman
with
a
case
of
instruments
under
his
arm
he
announced
himself
as
a
chiropodist
who
could
instantly
remove
the
worst
corns
not
only
without
pain
but
he
promised
by
means
of
a
mysterious
liniment
in
his
possession
to
immediately
heal
the
spot
from
which
he
removed
the
corn
now
i
had
not
a
corn
on
my
feet
but
willing
to
test
his
wonderful
powers
i
told
him
to
examine
my
left
foot
and
to
remove
a
troublesome
corn
on
the
little
toe
surely
enough
he
did
remove
and
exhibit
such
a
corn
as
i
am
sure
would
have
prevented
my
walking
had
i
known
that
i
was
so
grievously
afflicted
he
then
poured
some
of
his
red
oil
on
the
toe
and
triumphantly
showed
me
that
the
place
had
already
entirely
healed
pretending
to
be
delighted
with
his
skill
i
held
out
another
toe
for
operation
and
watching
him
carefully
i
saw
him
slip
a
manufactured
corn
into
his
oil
bottle
which
after
fumbling
awhile
and
pretending
to
pare
the
unoffending
toe
he
more
delighted
than
ever
i
rang
the
bell
and
told
the
servant
to
send
up
the
landlord
as
i
wished
him
to
witness
the
extraordinary
skill
of
the
the
landlord
arrived
and
after
a
few
words
of
eulogy
upon
the
chiropodist
i
submitted
another
healthy
toe
and
forth
came
another
monstrous
corn
for
the
same
process
of
extraction
with
the
same
results
could
have
been
performed
on
the
foot
of
a
marble
statue
it
was
now
my
turn
to
operate
so
i
rose
and
bolted
the
door
and
took
off
my
coat
telling
the
doctor
that
i
greatly
admired
his
gold
mounted
instruments
and
the
brazen
impudence
with
which
he
swindled
the
public
but
that
this
time
he
had
caught
a
tartar
and
that
he
could
not
leave
the
room
till
he
had
been
searched
the
quack
bristled
up
in
grand
style
at
what
he
termed
my
ungentlemanly
behavior
and
threatened
if
i
touched
him
to
bring
me
before
the
i
remarked
that
i
rather
thought
the
tribunal
was
the
last
place
on
earth
at
which
he
desired
to
appear
and
then
assuring
the
landlord
that
the
fellow
was
an
arrant
imposter
and
that
if
he
would
assist
me
in
searching
him
i
would
prove
it
and
warrant
that
no
harm
should
come
to
the
searchers
he
consented
and
collared
the
chiropodist
the
fellow
seeing
that
we
were
resolved
quietly
submitted
we
first
searched
his
pockets
and
found
nothing
but
upon
examining
his
morocco
instrument
case
we
discovered
a
drawer
in
which
were
eighty
corns
and
a
small
piece
of
horn
which
furnished
the
raw
material
for
the
manufacture
fortunately
my
right
foot
was
not
bare
and
i
forthwith
gave
the
chiropodist
a
lesson
in
the
shape
of
a
warm
visitation
of
which
sent
him
flying
down
stairs
where
the
dose
was
doubled
by
an
attentive
servant
till
the
chiropodist
reached
the
street
he
did
not
call
at
the
hotel
bedford
again
during
my
stay
i
was
a
good
deal
amused
when
i
was
in
brighton
england
during
the
same
year
to
see
how
some
people
manage
to
reconcile
cash
and
conscience
every
one
knows
that
brighton
is
a
fashionable
frequented
by
all
sorts
of
people
but
the
actual
residents
many
of
whom
are
very
wealthy
are
supposed
to
be
quite
removed
from
the
fashionable
and
other
follies
of
the
visitors
from
abroad
during
the
the
millionnaires
of
brighton
when
i
was
there
were
great
and
at
the
same
time
were
extensive
owners
in
the
stock
of
the
railway
which
brought
so
many
visitors
to
the
place
it
was
therefore
for
their
interest
that
trains
should
run
on
sundays
as
well
as
on
other
days
but
as
such
a
course
would
clash
with
their
religious
professions
it
was
necessary
that
some
plan
should
be
devised
by
which
a
compromise
could
be
effected
between
profits
and
profession
cash
and
conscience
for
the
idea
of
ever
sacrificing
interest
to
principle
never
enters
the
minds
of
those
whose
religion
may
be
in
their
heads
while
it
never
reaches
their
hearts
the
compromise
between
the
duty
and
the
dividends
of
the
brighton
railway
shareholders
was
effected
as
follows
after
a
great
deal
of
talk
and
on
the
subject
the
trains
on
sunday
were
permitted
to
arrive
and
depart
on
the
following
conditions
but
little
noise
and
confusion
was
manifest
and
there
were
fewer
porters
employed
about
the
station
than
on
obliging
the
arriving
and
departing
passengers
not
only
to
look
after
but
to
lift
their
baggage
and
as
that
is
locomotive
would
disturb
the
sanctity
of
the
sabbath
a
bugle
gave
notice
of
the
incoming
and
outgoing
of
the
trains
but
even
this
was
not
enough
it
was
expressly
stipulated
that
the
should
play
nothing
but
sacred
music
thus
trains
came
in
to
old
hundred
or
some
similar
psalm
tune
and
went
out
to
the
air
of
dismission
common
to
the
hymn
commencing
lord
dismiss
us
with
thy
i
do
not
know
that
this
custom
is
still
kept
up
at
brighton
but
it
certainly
was
so
when
i
was
there
in
and
it
was
gravely
recommended
to
others
who
favored
a
very
strict
observance
of
sunday
and
yet
liked
their
dividends
or
were
eager
for
sunday
mails
in
common
phrase
it
was
whipping
the
evil
one
round
the
stump
in
a
curious
way
it
reminded
me
of
the
good
old
deacon
in
connecticut
who
was
in
the
habit
of
selling
milk
to
his
neighbors
on
all
days
in
the
week
one
sunday
however
his
parson
came
home
with
him
to
tea
and
while
they
were
at
the
table
a
little
girl
came
in
for
a
quart
of
milk
the
deacon
was
afraid
of
being
scandalized
in
the
presence
of
the
parson
and
so
he
told
the
girl
he
did
not
sell
milk
on
sunday
the
girl
who
had
been
accustomed
to
buy
on
that
day
as
on
other
days
was
much
surprised
and
turned
to
go
away
when
the
sixpence
in
her
hand
was
too
much
of
a
temptation
for
the
deacon
who
called
out
here
little
girl
you
can
leave
the
money
now
and
call
and
get
the
milk
during
my
journeyings
abroad
i
was
not
wholly
free
from
the
usual
infirmity
of
travellers
viz
a
desire
to
look
at
the
old
castles
of
feudal
times
whether
in
preservation
or
in
ruins
but
there
was
one
of
our
party
sherman
who
had
a
peculiar
and
irresistible
taste
for
the
antique
he
gathered
trunks
full
of
stone
and
timber
mementos
from
every
place
of
note
which
we
visited
and
if
there
was
anything
which
he
admired
more
than
all
else
it
was
an
old
castle
he
spent
many
hours
in
clambering
the
broken
walls
of
kenilworth
in
viewing
the
towers
and
dungeons
of
warwick
and
climbing
the
precipices
of
dumbarton
when
travelling
by
coach
sherman
always
secured
an
outside
seat
and
if
possible
next
to
the
coachman
so
as
to
be
able
to
make
inquiries
regarding
everything
which
he
might
happen
to
see
on
our
journey
from
belfast
to
drogheda
sherman
occupied
his
usual
seat
beside
the
driver
and
asked
him
a
thousand
questions
the
coachman
was
a
regular
wag
with
genuine
irish
wit
and
he
determined
to
have
a
little
bit
of
fun
at
the
expense
of
the
inquisitive
yankee
as
we
came
within
eight
miles
of
drogheda
the
watchful
eye
of
sherman
caught
the
glimpse
of
a
large
stone
pile
appearing
like
a
castle
looming
up
among
some
trees
in
a
field
half
a
mile
from
the
roadside
oh
look
here
what
do
you
call
that
exclaimed
sherman
giving
the
coachman
an
elbowing
in
the
ribs
which
was
anything
but
pleasant
faith
replied
the
coachman
you
may
well
ask
what
we
call
that
for
divil
a
call
do
we
know
what
to
call
it
that
is
a
castle
sir
beyond
all
question
the
oldest
in
ireland
indade
none
of
the
old
books
nor
journals
contain
any
account
of
it
it
is
known
however
that
brian
borrhoime
inhabited
it
some
time
though
it
is
supposed
to
have
been
built
centuries
before
his
i
ll
give
you
to
stop
the
coach
long
enough
for
me
to
run
and
bring
a
scrap
of
it
away
said
sherman
sure
and
isn
t
this
the
royal
mail
coach
and
i
would
not
dare
detain
it
for
half
the
bank
of
ireland
replied
the
honest
coachman
how
far
is
it
to
drogheda
inquired
sherman
about
eight
miles
more
or
less
answered
the
coachman
stop
your
coach
and
let
me
down
then
replied
sherman
i
ll
walk
to
drogheda
and
would
sooner
walk
three
times
the
distance
than
not
have
a
nearer
view
and
carry
off
a
portion
of
the
oldest
castle
in
with
that
sherman
dismounted
and
raising
his
umbrella
to
protect
him
from
the
cold
rain
which
was
falling
in
torrents
he
marched
off
in
the
mud
calling
out
to
me
that
i
might
expect
him
in
dublin
by
the
next
train
to
that
which
would
take
us
from
drogheda
the
railroad
being
then
completed
only
to
that
point
from
dublin
we
arrived
in
dublin
about
five
o
clock
cold
and
uncomfortable
but
warm
apartments
and
good
fires
were
in
waiting
for
us
and
in
a
few
hours
we
had
partaken
of
an
excellent
supper
and
were
as
happy
as
lords
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
door
of
our
parlor
was
opened
and
who
should
come
in
but
poor
sherman
drenched
to
the
skin
with
cold
rain
the
legs
of
his
boots
pulled
over
the
bottoms
of
his
pantaloons
and
covered
with
thick
mud
to
the
very
tops
and
himself
looking
like
a
weary
and
frozen
traveller
for
heaven
s
sake
let
me
get
to
the
fire
exclaimed
sherman
and
we
were
too
much
struck
with
his
suffering
appearance
not
to
heed
it
well
sherman
i
remarked
that
must
have
been
a
tedious
walk
for
you
eight
long
irish
miles
through
the
rain
and
i
guess
you
would
have
thought
so
if
you
had
walked
it
yourself
replied
sherman
doggedly
i
hope
you
have
brought
away
trophies
enough
from
the
castle
to
pay
you
for
all
this
trouble
i
continued
oh
curse
the
castle
exclaimed
sherman
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
asked
in
astonishment
oh
you
need
not
look
surprised
replied
sherman
for
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
and
that
irish
coachman
have
had
fun
enough
at
my
expense
before
this
i
assured
him
that
i
positively
had
not
heard
the
coachman
speak
on
the
subject
and
begged
him
to
tell
me
what
had
occurred
to
vex
him
in
this
manner
why
if
you
don
t
already
know
replied
sherman
i
would
not
have
you
know
for
twenty
pounds
for
you
would
be
sure
to
publish
it
however
now
your
curiosity
is
excited
you
would
be
certain
to
find
it
all
out
if
you
had
to
hire
a
and
ride
there
on
purpose
so
i
may
as
well
tell
do
tell
me
i
replied
for
i
confess
my
curiosity
is
excited
and
i
am
unable
to
guess
why
you
are
so
angry
for
i
know
you
love
to
see
castles
and
that
pleasure
you
surely
have
enjoyed
for
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
no
you
have
not
seen
a
castle
nor
i
either
exclaimed
sherman
what
on
earth
was
it
then
i
asked
a
thundering
old
exclaimed
sherman
and
i
only
wish
i
could
pitch
that
infernal
irish
coachman
into
it
while
it
was
under
full
blast
it
was
many
a
long
day
before
sherman
heard
the
last
of
the
in
fact
this
trick
of
the
irish
coachman
rendered
him
cautious
in
making
inquiries
of
strangers
one
day
we
rode
to
donnybrook
the
place
so
much
celebrated
for
its
fairs
and
its
black
eyes
for
it
would
be
quite
out
of
character
for
pat
to
attend
a
fair
without
having
a
flourish
of
the
shillelah
and
a
scrimmage
which
would
result
in
a
few
broken
heads
and
bloody
noses
near
donnybrook
we
saw
something
on
the
summit
of
a
hill
which
appeared
like
a
round
stone
tower
it
was
probably
sixty
feet
in
circumference
and
feet
high
i
would
like
to
know
what
that
is
said
sherman
i
advised
him
to
inquire
of
the
first
coachman
that
came
along
but
with
a
forced
smile
he
declined
my
advice
it
can
t
be
a
at
any
rate
continued
sherman
it
must
be
a
castle
of
some
the
more
we
looked
at
it
the
more
mysterious
did
it
appear
to
us
and
sherman
s
propensities
momentarily
increased
at
last
he
exclaimed
a
man
who
travels
with
a
tongue
in
his
head
is
a
fool
if
he
don
t
use
it
and
i
am
not
going
within
a
hundred
rods
of
what
may
be
the
greatest
curiosity
in
ireland
without
knowing
with
that
he
turned
our
horse
s
head
towards
a
mansion
on
our
right
where
we
halted
sherman
jumped
from
the
carriage
opened
the
small
gate
proceeded
up
the
alley
of
the
lawn
fronting
the
house
and
rang
the
bell
a
servant
appeared
at
the
door
but
sherman
knowing
the
stupidity
of
irish
servants
was
determined
to
apply
at
for
the
information
he
so
much
desired
is
your
master
in
asked
sherman
i
will
see
sir
what
name
if
you
plaze
a
stranger
from
the
united
states
of
america
replied
sherman
the
servant
departed
and
in
a
minute
returned
and
invited
sherman
to
enter
the
parlor
he
found
the
gentleman
of
the
mansion
sitting
by
a
pleasant
fire
near
which
were
also
his
lady
and
several
visitors
and
members
of
the
family
sherman
was
not
troubled
with
diffidence
being
seated
he
hoped
he
would
be
excused
for
having
called
without
an
invitation
but
the
fact
was
he
was
an
american
traveller
desirous
of
picking
up
all
important
information
that
might
fall
in
his
way
the
gentleman
politely
replied
that
no
apology
was
necessary
that
he
was
most
happy
to
see
him
and
that
any
information
which
he
could
impart
regarding
that
or
any
other
portion
of
the
country
should
be
given
with
pleasure
thank
you
replied
sherman
i
will
not
trouble
you
except
on
a
single
point
i
have
seen
all
that
is
important
in
dublin
and
its
vicinity
and
in
and
about
donnybrook
there
is
but
one
thing
respecting
which
i
want
information
and
that
is
the
stone
tower
or
castle
which
we
see
standing
on
the
hill
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
south
of
your
house
if
you
could
give
me
the
name
and
history
of
that
pile
i
shall
feel
extremely
oh
nothing
is
easier
replied
the
gentleman
with
a
smile
that
pile
as
you
call
it
was
built
some
forty
years
ago
by
my
father
and
it
was
a
lucky
pile
for
him
for
it
was
the
only
windmill
in
these
parts
and
always
had
plenty
to
do
but
a
few
years
ago
a
hurricane
carried
off
the
wings
of
the
mill
and
ever
since
that
it
has
stood
as
it
now
does
a
memorial
of
its
former
usefulness
is
there
any
other
important
information
that
i
can
give
you
asked
the
gentleman
with
a
smile
not
any
replied
sherman
rising
to
depart
but
perhaps
i
can
give
you
some
and
that
is
that
ireland
is
beyond
all
dispute
the
meanest
country
i
ever
travelled
in
the
only
two
objects
worthy
of
note
that
i
have
seen
in
all
ireland
are
a
and
the
foundation
for
a
windmill
upon
resuming
his
seat
in
the
carriage
sherman
laughed
immoderately
although
he
evidently
felt
somewhat
chagrined
by
this
second
mistake
in
searching
for
ancient
castles
calling
one
day
in
one
of
the
principal
hotels
in
dublin
i
noticed
among
the
rules
framed
and
hung
in
the
for
the
warning
instruction
or
entertainment
of
the
guests
of
the
house
the
following
no
gambling
or
politics
will
be
allowed
to
in
this
house
by
any
parties
how
politics
could
take
place
in
an
irish
hotel
or
elsewhere
would
have
been
a
mystery
to
me
if
i
did
not
remember
that
the
scrimmages
and
rows
which
often
follow
the
mere
discussion
of
politics
seemed
to
warrant
the
landlord
in
classing
politics
with
gambling
or
any
other
dangerous
amusement
which
might
take
place
in
the
of
an
irish
inn
speaking
of
irishmen
i
am
reminded
of
an
illustration
of
ready
irish
wit
which
is
located
on
the
line
of
the
boston
and
fitchburg
railroad
some
years
ago
the
reverend
thomas
whittemore
a
wealthy
universalist
minister
who
was
a
large
stockholder
in
the
road
was
appointed
president
of
the
company
and
as
he
was
exceedingly
conscientious
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
he
once
took
upon
himself
to
walk
over
every
foot
of
the
route
to
see
if
every
part
of
the
road
was
in
complete
order
walking
along
in
this
way
and
alone
he
came
to
a
place
where
a
loose
rail
lay
alongside
of
the
track
and
seeing
an
irishman
near
by
who
was
apparently
employed
on
the
road
whittemore
called
out
to
him
here
pat
pick
up
this
rail
and
lay
it
alongside
of
the
fence
out
of
the
way
till
it
is
it
never
occurred
to
whittemore
that
every
man
whom
he
met
did
not
know
him
and
his
official
position
but
pat
not
dreaming
that
his
virtual
employer
the
president
of
the
railroad
company
was
giving
him
an
order
sharply
answered
jist
go
to
the
divil
will
ye
my
dear
friend
said
the
smiling
whittemore
who
instantly
comprehended
the
situation
that
is
that
pat
did
not
know
him
and
no
particular
wonder
either
go
to
the
devil
why
that
is
the
last
place
i
should
desire
to
go
to
an
faith
an
i
think
it
s
the
last
place
you
be
goin
to
responded
pat
of
railroads
and
railroad
travel
and
employees
i
have
heard
and
told
no
end
of
stories
but
one
of
the
latest
and
best
i
think
is
told
of
a
man
in
a
town
down
east
who
had
some
difficulty
with
a
conductor
and
vowed
that
not
another
cent
of
his
money
should
ever
go
into
the
treasury
of
that
company
but
said
the
conductor
of
the
road
you
own
property
in
one
place
on
the
line
and
do
business
in
another
place
and
are
obliged
to
go
back
and
forth
almost
every
day
how
are
you
going
to
help
paying
something
to
the
company
oh
hereafter
i
shall
pay
my
fare
to
you
in
the
cars
was
the
reply
it
may
be
a
joke
but
conductors
themselves
that
is
some
of
them
are
more
or
less
facetious
on
the
subject
of
what
in
the
vernacular
is
known
as
knocking
soon
after
the
conductors
on
the
new
york
and
new
haven
railroad
were
put
in
costume
while
on
duty
and
were
obliged
to
wear
a
badge
bearing
the
initials
of
the
company
my
friend
rev
chapin
was
accompanying
me
over
the
road
to
my
bridgeport
home
when
along
came
a
conductor
whom
we
both
knew
well
to
collect
our
fares
ah
i
see
said
chapin
pointing
to
the
letters
on
the
new
badge
n
neither
here
nor
no
whispered
the
conductor
confidentially
in
the
doctor
s
ear
it
means
new
house
next
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
tell
the
thousands
who
know
chapin
that
he
is
a
man
of
most
ready
wit
and
an
inveterate
punster
one
day
when
we
were
dining
together
i
was
carving
a
chicken
which
the
doctor
pronounced
a
offence
when
having
some
difficulty
with
a
tough
wing
i
exclaimed
how
shall
i
get
the
thing
off
anyhow
pullet
gravely
answered
the
doctor
eggsactly
said
i
then
began
what
the
doctor
called
a
battle
of
the
spurs
i
trying
to
crow
over
the
doctor
and
he
endeavoring
to
upset
my
urging
me
meanwhile
to
scratch
away
till
at
last
i
told
him
if
he
made
another
pun
on
that
lay
he
would
knock
me
off
the
roost
oh
then
said
the
doctor
finally
feathering
his
nest
sha
n
t
i
clear
an
equally
fowl
pun
of
the
doctor
s
was
perpetrated
in
cold
blood
or
rather
in
very
cold
water
down
at
rockport
massachusetts
thither
every
summer
season
were
wont
to
congregate
for
their
vacation
such
celebrated
clergymen
as
starr
king
chapin
and
others
mainly
for
the
fine
there
one
season
chapin
arrived
at
least
a
fortnight
behind
the
rest
and
when
they
went
down
bathing
together
the
acclimated
visitors
pronounced
the
water
to
be
delightful
just
right
and
so
on
but
isn
t
it
cold
asked
chapin
oh
no
replied
starr
king
you
have
only
to
go
down
and
up
twice
and
you
are
warm
ah
i
see
how
it
is
said
chapin
who
tried
the
experiment
and
came
up
half
frozen
you
are
warm
after
down
and
up
twice
why
that
s
a
pair
o
ducks
fowls
naturally
suggest
the
market
and
this
brings
to
mind
a
neighbor
of
mine
in
new
york
who
keeps
two
things
a
and
bad
his
wife
justly
suspected
him
of
gambling
but
he
generally
managed
to
get
in
before
midnight
and
always
had
money
enough
in
his
pocket
to
go
to
market
with
in
the
morning
on
one
occasion
however
after
gambling
all
night
he
did
not
come
home
till
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
after
a
sound
scolding
from
his
wife
for
staying
out
all
night
and
gambling
as
she
insisted
he
was
sent
to
market
to
get
something
for
breakfast
returning
he
was
again
berated
by
his
wife
for
gambling
he
protesting
all
the
while
that
he
had
been
spending
the
night
with
a
sick
his
wife
might
have
believed
him
if
he
had
not
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
half
asleep
and
solemnly
passed
the
bread
to
the
nearest
boarder
with
the
exclamation
cut
your
sick
friend
exclaimed
the
wife
while
a
general
roar
around
the
table
woke
the
host
to
the
fact
that
he
was
passing
bread
and
not
a
pack
of
cards
this
carries
me
back
to
my
boyhood
days
at
bethel
and
brings
to
mind
an
old
clerical
acquaintance
whom
i
knew
long
before
i
met
chapin
the
rev
richard
varick
dey
who
resided
at
greenfield
connecticut
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
bethel
to
preach
on
sabbath
evenings
he
was
a
very
eloquent
preacher
and
an
eccentric
man
he
possessed
fine
talents
his
sermons
were
rich
in
pathos
and
wit
and
he
was
exceedingly
popular
with
the
world
s
people
the
more
however
were
afraid
of
him
his
remarks
both
in
and
out
of
the
pulpit
would
frequently
rub
hard
against
some
popular
dogma
or
knock
in
the
head
some
favorite
religious
tenet
dey
was
therefore
frequently
in
hot
water
with
the
church
and
was
either
suspended
or
about
to
be
brought
to
trial
for
some
alleged
breach
of
ministerial
duty
or
some
suspected
heresy
while
thus
debarred
from
preaching
he
felt
that
he
must
do
something
to
support
his
family
with
this
view
he
visited
bethel
danbury
and
other
towns
and
delivered
lectures
at
the
termination
of
which
contributions
for
his
benefit
were
taken
up
i
remember
his
lecturing
in
bethel
on
this
discourse
overflowed
with
eloquence
and
pathos
and
terminated
in
a
contribution
of
more
than
fifty
dollars
it
was
said
that
on
one
occasion
dey
was
about
to
be
tried
before
an
ecclesiastical
body
at
middletown
there
being
no
railroads
in
those
days
many
persons
travelled
on
horseback
two
days
before
the
trial
was
to
take
place
dey
started
for
middletown
alone
and
on
horseback
his
valise
was
fastened
behind
the
saddle
and
putting
on
his
large
surmounted
with
a
half
a
dozen
broad
capes
as
was
the
fashion
of
that
period
and
donning
a
hat
he
mounted
his
horse
and
started
for
the
scene
of
trial
on
the
second
day
of
his
journey
and
some
ten
miles
before
reaching
middletown
he
overtook
a
brother
clergyman
also
on
horseback
who
was
wending
his
way
to
the
consociation
he
was
a
man
perhaps
sixty
years
of
age
and
his
silvered
locks
stood
out
like
porcupine
quills
his
iron
visage
which
seemed
never
to
have
worn
a
smile
his
sinister
expression
small
keen
eyes
and
compressed
lips
convinced
dey
that
he
had
no
hope
of
mercy
from
that
man
as
one
of
his
judges
the
reverend
gentlemen
soon
fell
into
conversation
the
sanctimonious
clergyman
gave
his
name
and
residence
and
inquired
those
of
dey
my
name
is
richard
replied
rev
richard
dey
and
my
residence
is
greenfield
is
a
parish
in
the
town
of
fairfield
ah
exclaimed
the
other
clergyman
then
you
live
near
dey
do
you
know
him
perfectly
well
responded
the
eccentric
richard
well
what
do
you
think
of
him
inquired
the
anxious
brother
he
is
a
cunning
fellow
one
whom
i
should
be
sorry
to
offend
for
i
would
not
like
to
fall
into
his
clutches
but
if
compelled
to
do
so
i
could
divulge
some
things
which
would
astonish
our
is
it
possible
well
of
course
your
duty
to
the
church
and
the
redeemer
s
cause
will
prompt
you
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
divulge
everything
you
know
against
the
accused
responded
the
excited
clergyman
it
is
hard
to
destroy
a
brother
s
reputation
and
break
up
the
peace
of
his
family
answered
the
meek
richard
it
is
the
duty
of
the
elect
to
expose
and
punish
the
reprobates
replied
the
sturdy
puritan
but
had
i
not
better
first
tell
our
brother
his
fault
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
confess
and
be
forgiven
our
brother
as
you
call
him
is
undoubtedly
a
heretic
and
the
true
faith
is
wounded
by
his
presence
amongst
us
the
church
must
be
purged
from
unbelief
we
must
beware
of
those
who
would
introduce
damnable
are
you
sure
that
dey
is
an
unbeliever
inquired
the
modest
richard
i
have
heard
that
he
throws
doubt
upon
the
trinity
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
some
portions
of
the
saybrook
platform
and
has
said
that
even
reprobates
may
sincerely
repent
pray
for
forgiveness
and
be
saved
ay
that
he
even
doubts
the
damnation
of
unregenerate
infants
horrible
ejaculated
richard
yes
horrible
indeed
but
i
trust
that
our
consociation
will
excommunicate
him
at
once
and
forever
but
what
do
you
know
concerning
his
belief
i
know
nothing
specially
against
his
belief
responded
richard
but
i
have
witnessed
some
of
his
acts
which
i
should
be
almost
sorry
to
a
mistaken
charity
it
is
your
duty
to
tell
the
consociation
all
you
know
regarding
the
culprit
and
i
shall
insist
upon
your
doing
i
certainly
desire
to
do
that
which
is
right
and
just
and
as
i
am
but
young
in
the
ministry
i
shall
defer
to
your
judgment
founded
on
age
and
experience
but
i
would
prefer
at
first
to
state
to
you
what
i
know
and
then
will
be
guided
by
your
advice
in
regard
to
giving
my
testimony
before
the
a
very
proper
course
you
can
state
the
facts
to
me
and
i
will
give
you
my
counsel
now
what
do
you
know
i
know
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
have
caught
him
in
the
act
of
kissing
my
wife
replied
the
injured
richard
i
am
not
at
all
astonished
responded
the
clergyman
such
conduct
coincides
exactly
with
the
opinion
i
had
formed
of
the
man
i
commiserate
you
sir
but
i
honor
your
sense
of
duty
in
divulging
such
important
facts
even
at
the
expense
of
exposing
serious
troubles
in
your
domestic
relations
but
sir
justice
must
have
its
course
these
facts
must
be
testified
to
before
the
consociation
do
you
know
anything
else
against
the
delinquent
i
know
something
more
but
it
is
of
a
nature
so
delicate
and
concerns
me
personally
so
seriously
that
i
must
decline
divulging
sir
you
can
not
do
that
i
will
not
permit
it
but
will
insist
on
your
telling
the
whole
truth
before
our
consociation
though
your
were
to
break
in
consequence
i
repeat
sir
that
i
sympathize
with
you
personally
but
personal
feelings
must
be
swallowed
up
in
the
promotion
of
public
good
no
sympathy
for
an
individual
can
be
permitted
to
clash
with
the
interests
of
the
true
church
you
had
better
tell
me
sir
all
you
since
you
say
that
duty
requires
it
i
will
do
so
i
have
caught
him
under
very
suspicious
circumstances
in
my
wife
s
bedroom
said
the
unfortunate
richard
was
your
wife
in
bed
inquired
the
man
with
the
iron
face
she
was
faintly
lisped
the
almost
swooning
richard
enough
enough
was
the
response
our
consociation
will
soon
dispose
of
the
rev
richard
the
two
clergymen
had
now
arrived
at
middletown
the
rev
vinegarface
rode
to
the
parsonage
while
dey
mr
richard
went
to
a
small
and
obscure
inn
the
consociation
commenced
the
next
day
this
ecclesiastical
body
was
soon
organized
and
after
disposing
of
several
minor
questions
it
was
proposed
to
take
up
the
charges
of
heresy
against
the
rev
dey
the
accused
with
a
most
demure
countenance
was
conversing
with
his
quondam
travelling
companion
of
the
day
previous
who
upon
hearing
this
proposition
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
informed
the
reverend
chairman
that
providentially
he
had
been
put
in
possession
of
facts
which
must
necessarily
result
in
the
immediate
expulsion
of
the
culprit
from
the
church
and
save
the
necessity
of
examining
testimony
on
the
question
of
heresy
in
fact
continued
he
i
am
prepared
to
prove
that
the
rev
richard
dey
has
frequently
kissed
the
wife
of
one
of
our
brethren
and
has
also
been
caught
in
a
situation
which
affords
strong
evidence
of
his
being
guilty
of
the
crime
of
adultery
a
thrill
of
horror
and
surprise
ran
through
the
assembly
every
eye
was
turned
to
dey
who
was
seated
so
closely
to
the
last
speaker
that
he
touched
him
as
he
resumed
his
seat
dey
s
countenance
was
as
placid
as
a
may
morning
and
it
required
keen
vision
to
detect
the
lurking
smile
of
satisfaction
that
peeped
from
a
corner
of
his
eye
a
few
minutes
of
dead
silence
elapsed
produce
your
witnesses
finally
said
the
chairman
in
an
almost
sepulchral
voice
i
call
on
the
rev
richard
of
fairfield
to
corroborate
under
oath
the
charges
which
i
have
made
responded
the
puritan
not
a
person
moved
mr
dey
looked
as
unconcerned
as
if
he
was
an
utter
stranger
to
all
present
and
understood
not
the
language
which
they
were
speaking
where
is
the
rev
richard
inquired
the
venerable
chairman
here
he
is
responded
the
accuser
familiarly
tapping
dey
on
the
shoulder
the
whole
audience
burst
into
such
a
roar
of
laughter
as
probably
never
was
heard
in
a
like
consociation
before
the
accuser
was
almost
petrified
with
astonishment
at
such
inconceivable
conduct
on
the
part
of
that
sedate
religious
assembly
dey
alone
maintained
the
utmost
gravity
that
sir
is
the
rev
richard
dey
replied
the
chairman
when
order
was
restored
the
look
of
utter
dismay
which
instantly
marked
the
countenance
of
the
accuser
threw
the
assembly
into
another
convulsion
of
laughter
during
which
dey
s
victim
withdrew
and
was
not
seen
again
in
middletown
the
charges
of
heresy
were
then
brought
forward
after
a
brief
investigation
they
were
dismissed
for
want
of
proof
and
dey
returned
to
greenfield
triumphant
i
have
often
heard
dey
relate
the
following
anecdote
a
young
couple
called
on
him
one
day
at
his
house
in
greenfield
they
informed
him
that
they
were
from
the
southern
portion
of
the
state
and
desired
to
be
married
they
were
well
dressed
made
considerable
display
of
jewelry
and
altogether
wore
an
air
of
respectability
dey
felt
confident
that
all
was
right
and
calling
in
several
witnesses
he
proceeded
to
unite
them
in
the
holy
bonds
of
wedlock
after
the
ceremonies
were
concluded
dey
invited
the
happy
pair
as
was
usual
in
those
days
to
partake
of
some
cake
and
wine
they
thus
spent
a
social
together
and
on
rising
to
depart
the
bridegroom
handed
dey
a
bank
note
remarking
that
this
was
the
smallest
bill
he
had
but
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
pay
their
hotel
bill
they
had
merely
dined
and
fed
their
horse
at
the
hotel
he
could
retain
the
balance
of
the
money
for
his
services
dey
thanked
him
for
his
liberality
and
went
at
once
to
the
hotel
with
the
lady
and
gentleman
and
informed
the
landlord
that
he
would
settle
their
bill
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
and
the
next
day
it
was
discovered
that
the
was
a
counterfeit
and
that
dey
had
to
pay
nearly
three
dollars
for
the
privilege
of
marrying
this
loving
couple
the
newspapers
in
various
parts
of
the
state
subsequently
published
facts
which
showed
that
the
affectionate
pair
got
married
in
every
town
they
passed
through
thus
paying
their
expenses
and
fleecing
the
clergymen
by
means
of
counterfeits
one
of
the
deacons
of
dey
s
church
asked
him
if
he
usually
kissed
the
bride
at
weddings
always
was
the
reply
how
do
you
manage
when
the
happy
pair
are
negroes
was
the
deacon
s
next
question
in
all
such
cases
replied
dey
the
duty
of
kissing
is
appointed
to
the
my
grandfather
was
a
universalist
and
for
various
reasons
fancied
or
real
he
was
bitterly
opposed
to
the
presbyterians
in
doctrinal
views
though
personally
some
of
them
were
his
warmest
and
most
intimate
friends
being
much
attached
to
dey
he
induced
that
gentleman
to
deliver
a
series
of
sunday
evening
sermons
in
bethel
and
my
grandfather
was
not
only
on
all
these
occasions
one
of
the
most
prominent
and
attentive
hearers
but
dey
was
always
his
guest
he
would
generally
stop
over
monday
and
tuesday
with
my
grandfather
and
as
several
of
the
most
social
neighbors
were
called
in
they
usually
had
a
jolly
time
of
it
occasionally
mine
host
would
attack
dey
on
theological
points
and
would
generally
come
off
second
best
but
he
delighted
although
vanquished
to
repeat
the
sharp
answers
with
which
dey
met
his
objections
to
the
confession
of
one
day
when
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
neighbors
were
present
and
enjoying
themselves
in
passing
around
the
bottle
relating
anecdotes
and
cracking
jokes
my
grandfather
called
out
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
which
at
once
arrested
the
attention
of
all
present
friend
dey
i
believe
you
pretend
to
believe
in
foreordination
to
be
sure
i
do
replied
dey
well
now
suppose
i
should
spit
in
your
face
what
would
you
do
inquired
my
grandfather
i
hope
that
is
not
a
supposable
case
responded
dey
for
i
should
probably
knock
you
that
would
be
very
inconsistent
replied
my
grandfather
exultingly
for
if
i
spat
in
your
face
it
would
be
because
it
was
foreordained
i
should
do
so
why
then
would
you
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
knock
me
down
because
it
would
be
foreordained
that
i
should
knock
you
down
replied
dey
with
a
smile
the
company
burst
into
a
laugh
in
which
my
grandfather
heartily
joined
my
father
as
well
as
my
grandfather
was
very
fond
of
a
practical
joke
and
he
lost
no
occasion
which
offered
for
playing
off
one
upon
his
friends
and
neighbors
in
addition
to
his
store
tavern
and
business
to
norwalk
he
kept
a
small
and
on
one
occasion
a
young
man
named
nelson
beers
applied
to
him
for
the
use
of
a
horse
to
ride
to
danbury
a
distance
of
three
miles
nelson
was
an
apprentice
to
the
business
nearly
out
of
his
time
was
not
with
brains
and
lived
a
mile
and
a
half
east
of
our
village
my
father
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
nelson
to
make
his
short
journey
on
foot
than
to
be
at
the
expense
of
hiring
a
horse
but
he
did
not
tell
him
so
we
had
an
old
horse
named
having
reached
an
age
beyond
his
teens
he
was
turned
out
in
a
bog
lot
near
our
house
to
die
he
was
literally
a
living
skeleton
much
in
the
same
condition
of
the
yankee
s
nag
which
was
so
weak
his
owner
had
to
hire
his
neighbor
s
horse
to
help
him
draw
his
last
breath
my
father
in
reply
to
nelson
s
application
told
him
that
the
livery
horses
were
all
out
and
he
had
none
at
home
except
a
famous
which
he
was
keeping
in
low
flesh
in
order
to
have
him
in
proper
trim
to
win
a
great
race
soon
to
come
off
oh
do
let
me
have
him
uncle
phile
my
father
s
name
was
philo
but
as
it
was
the
custom
in
that
region
to
call
everybody
uncle
or
aunt
or
squire
or
deacon
or
colonel
or
captain
my
father
s
general
title
among
his
acquaintances
was
uncle
phile
i
will
ride
him
very
carefully
and
not
injure
him
in
the
least
besides
i
will
have
him
rubbed
down
and
fed
in
danbury
said
nelson
beers
he
is
too
valuable
an
animal
to
risk
in
the
hands
of
a
young
man
like
you
responded
my
father
nelson
continued
to
importune
and
my
father
to
play
off
until
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
horse
could
be
had
on
the
condition
that
he
should
in
no
case
be
ridden
faster
than
a
walk
or
slow
trot
and
that
he
should
be
fed
four
quarts
of
oats
at
danbury
nelson
started
on
his
rosinante
looking
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
was
on
a
mission
to
the
carrion
crows
but
he
felt
every
inch
a
man
for
he
fancied
himself
astride
of
the
greatest
in
the
country
and
realized
that
a
heavy
responsibility
was
resting
on
his
shoulders
for
the
last
words
of
my
father
to
him
were
now
nelson
if
any
accident
should
happen
to
this
animal
while
under
your
charge
you
could
not
pay
the
damage
in
a
lifetime
of
old
bob
was
duly
oated
and
watered
at
danbury
and
at
the
end
of
several
hours
mr
beers
mounted
him
and
started
for
bethel
he
concluded
to
take
the
great
pasture
road
home
that
being
the
name
of
a
new
road
cut
through
swamps
and
meadows
as
a
shorter
route
to
our
village
nelson
for
the
nonce
forgetting
his
responsibility
probably
tried
the
speed
of
his
and
soon
broke
him
down
at
all
events
something
occurred
to
weaken
old
bob
s
nerves
for
he
came
to
a
and
nelson
was
forced
to
dismount
the
horse
trembled
with
weakness
and
nelson
beers
trembled
with
fright
a
small
brook
was
running
through
the
bogs
at
the
roadside
and
beers
thinking
that
perhaps
his
needed
a
drink
led
him
into
the
stream
poor
old
bob
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
and
not
having
strength
to
withdraw
his
feet
quietly
closed
his
eyes
and
like
a
patriarch
as
he
was
he
dropped
into
the
soft
bed
that
was
awaiting
him
and
died
without
a
single
kick
no
language
can
describe
the
consternation
of
poor
beers
he
could
not
believe
his
eyes
and
vainly
tried
to
open
those
of
his
horse
he
placed
his
ear
at
the
mouth
of
poor
old
bob
but
took
it
away
again
in
utter
dismay
the
breath
had
ceased
at
last
nelson
groaning
as
he
thought
of
meeting
my
father
and
wondering
whether
eternity
added
to
time
would
be
long
enough
for
him
to
earn
the
value
of
the
horse
took
the
bridle
from
the
and
unbuckling
the
girth
drew
off
the
saddle
placed
it
on
his
own
back
and
trudged
gloomily
towards
our
village
it
was
about
sundown
when
my
father
espied
his
victim
coming
up
the
street
with
the
saddle
and
bridle
thrown
across
his
shoulders
his
face
wearing
a
look
of
the
most
complete
despair
my
father
was
certain
that
old
bob
had
departed
this
life
and
he
chuckled
inwardly
and
quietly
but
instantly
assumed
a
most
serious
countenance
poor
beers
approached
more
slowly
and
mournfully
than
if
he
was
following
a
dear
friend
to
the
grave
when
he
came
within
hailing
distance
my
father
called
out
why
beers
is
it
possible
you
have
been
so
careless
as
to
let
that
run
away
from
you
oh
worse
than
that
worse
than
that
uncle
phile
groaned
nelson
worse
than
that
then
he
has
been
stolen
by
some
judge
of
valuable
horses
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
to
intrust
him
to
anybody
exclaimed
my
father
with
sorrow
no
he
ain
t
stolen
uncle
phile
said
nelson
not
stolen
well
i
am
glad
of
that
for
i
shall
recover
him
again
but
where
is
he
i
am
afraid
you
have
lamed
worse
than
that
drawled
the
unfortunate
nelson
well
what
is
the
matter
where
is
he
what
ails
him
asked
my
father
oh
i
can
t
tell
you
i
can
t
tell
you
said
beers
with
a
groan
but
you
must
tell
me
returned
my
father
it
will
break
your
heart
groaned
beers
to
be
sure
it
will
if
he
is
seriously
injured
replied
my
father
but
where
is
he
he
is
dead
said
beers
as
he
nerved
himself
up
for
the
announcement
and
then
closing
his
eyes
sank
into
a
chair
completely
overcome
with
fright
my
father
groaned
in
a
way
that
started
nelson
to
his
feet
again
all
the
sensations
of
horror
intense
agony
and
despair
were
depicted
to
the
life
on
my
father
s
countenance
oh
uncle
phile
uncle
phile
don
t
be
too
hard
with
me
i
wouldn
t
have
had
it
happen
for
all
the
world
said
beers
you
can
never
recompense
me
for
that
horse
replied
my
father
i
know
it
i
know
it
uncle
phile
i
can
only
work
for
you
as
long
as
i
live
but
you
shall
have
my
services
till
you
are
satisfied
after
my
apprenticeship
is
finished
returned
beers
after
a
short
time
my
father
became
more
calm
and
although
apparently
not
reconciled
to
his
loss
he
asked
nelson
how
much
he
supposed
he
ought
to
owe
him
oh
i
don
t
know
i
am
no
judge
of
the
value
of
blood
horses
but
i
have
been
told
they
are
worth
fortunes
sometimes
replied
beers
and
mine
was
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
said
my
father
and
in
such
perfect
condition
for
running
all
bone
and
oh
yes
i
saw
that
said
beers
despondingly
but
with
a
frankness
that
showed
he
did
not
wish
to
deny
the
great
claims
of
the
horse
and
his
owner
well
said
my
father
with
a
sigh
as
i
have
no
desire
to
go
to
law
on
the
subject
we
had
better
try
to
agree
upon
the
value
of
the
horse
you
may
mark
on
a
slip
of
paper
what
sum
you
think
you
ought
to
owe
me
for
him
and
i
will
do
the
same
we
can
then
compare
notes
and
see
how
far
we
i
will
mark
said
beers
but
uncle
phile
don
t
be
too
hard
with
i
will
be
as
easy
as
i
can
and
endeavor
to
make
some
allowance
for
your
situation
said
my
father
but
nelson
when
i
think
how
valuable
that
horse
was
of
course
i
must
mark
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
amount
of
cash
i
could
have
received
for
him
i
believe
however
nelson
that
you
are
an
honest
young
man
and
are
willing
to
do
what
you
think
is
about
right
i
therefore
wish
to
caution
you
not
to
mark
down
one
cent
more
than
you
really
think
under
the
circumstances
you
ought
to
pay
me
when
you
are
able
and
for
which
you
are
now
willing
to
give
me
your
note
of
hand
you
will
recollect
that
i
told
you
when
you
applied
for
the
horse
that
i
did
not
wish
to
let
him
nelson
gave
my
father
a
grateful
look
and
assented
to
all
he
said
at
least
a
dozen
of
our
neighbors
were
witnessing
the
scene
with
great
apparent
solemnity
two
slips
of
paper
were
prepared
my
father
marked
on
one
and
after
much
hesitation
beers
wrote
on
the
other
well
let
us
see
what
you
have
marked
said
my
father
i
suppose
you
will
think
it
is
too
low
replied
beers
handing
my
father
the
slip
of
paper
only
three
hundred
and
dollars
exclaimed
my
father
reading
the
paper
well
there
is
a
pretty
specimen
of
gratitude
for
you
nelson
was
humbled
and
could
not
muster
sufficient
courage
to
ask
my
father
what
had
marked
finally
one
of
our
neighbors
asked
my
father
to
show
his
paper
he
did
so
he
had
marked
and
a
quarter
our
neighbor
read
it
aloud
and
a
shock
of
mirth
ensued
which
fairly
lifted
beers
to
his
feet
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
comprehend
the
joke
and
when
he
became
fully
aware
that
no
harm
was
done
he
was
the
happiest
fellow
i
have
ever
seen
i
might
fill
a
volume
with
these
reminiscences
of
my
younger
days
but
turning
once
more
to
my
foreign
notebooks
i
find
material
there
which
seems
to
claim
a
place
in
this
i
am
never
tired
of
telling
and
laughing
at
some
of
my
mishaps
and
adventures
in
trying
to
use
the
french
language
when
i
first
went
abroad
it
was
no
unusual
thing
to
travel
half
a
day
in
a
diligence
or
in
the
cars
with
some
englishman
as
i
would
afterwards
discover
both
of
us
doing
our
best
to
make
ourselves
intelligible
to
each
other
in
french
till
at
last
in
despair
one
or
the
other
would
utter
the
conventional
conundrum
anglais
why
of
course
i
am
an
american
or
an
englishman
and
then
a
mutual
roar
would
follow
american
or
english
or
dutch
french
is
generally
quite
a
different
thing
from
french
thus
i
could
always
understand
the
dutchmen
who
spoke
to
me
in
french
in
amsterdam
and
i
may
add
they
could
perfectly
understand
me
we
spoke
the
same
i
wrote
to
my
wife
i
remember
from
amsterdam
that
i
found
they
spoke
much
purer
french
in
that
city
than
in
paris
once
on
arriving
in
paris
at
the
station
of
the
northern
railway
i
with
other
passengers
was
in
the
room
devoted
to
the
examination
of
baggage
among
the
rest
was
a
party
consisting
of
a
new
york
merchant
and
his
wife
with
their
daughter
a
young
lady
of
eighteen
who
was
at
once
volatile
and
voluble
undoubtedly
she
had
spoken
the
best
school
french
for
five
years
or
more
and
with
this
she
fairly
overwhelmed
the
official
interpreter
who
was
present
after
hearing
her
for
full
five
minutes
the
interpreter
gravely
asked
do
you
speak
english
miss
certainly
was
the
reply
well
speak
english
then
if
you
please
for
i
can
understand
your
english
better
than
i
can
your
i
was
one
evening
at
the
house
of
my
friend
john
nimmo
in
paris
and
while
waiting
for
him
and
his
family
to
return
from
the
theatre
was
entertained
for
an
hour
or
more
by
two
very
agreeable
young
ladies
to
whom
i
made
such
reply
in
french
from
time
to
time
as
i
could
at
last
came
the
inevitable
inquiry
as
to
the
capacity
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
english
language
why
bless
us
barnum
was
the
reply
we
are
scotch
governesses
who
are
here
in
paris
simply
to
learn
french
the
last
time
i
went
from
france
to
england
arriving
late
at
night
i
stopped
in
dover
at
the
hotel
nearest
the
so
as
to
look
after
my
luggage
next
day
ringing
my
bell
early
in
the
morning
for
half
asleep
i
called
out
to
the
for
eau
please
sir
was
the
reply
i
do
not
speak
nor
i
either
said
i
promptly
just
bring
me
some
hot
water
if
you
but
some
of
the
english
have
a
queer
way
of
speaking
their
own
language
and
the
cockney
s
management
of
what
he
would
call
the
haspirate
is
sufficiently
familiar
crowding
into
exeter
hall
london
at
an
entertainment
one
evening
i
heard
the
usher
just
before
me
shouting
out
seats
as
he
looked
at
the
checks
in
this
fashion
letter
ha
first
row
letter
hef
sixth
row
letter
he
fifth
row
letter
hi
ninth
row
and
so
on
seeing
that
my
own
check
was
l
i
showed
it
to
him
and
quietly
inquired
where
do
i
go
to
usher
you
go
to
hell
was
the
prompt
response
which
was
not
intended
to
be
either
profane
or
impolite
but
i
must
bring

chapter

for

a

from
the
time
when
i
first
settled
in
bridgeport
and
turned
my
attention
to
opening
and
beautifying
new
avenues
and
doing
whatever
lay
in
my
power
to
extend
and
improve
that
charming
city
i
was
exceedingly
anxious
that
public
parks
should
be
established
especially
one
where
good
and
an
opportunity
for
the
display
of
the
many
fine
equipages
for
which
bridgeport
is
celebrated
could
be
afforded
noble
and
i
began
the
movement
by
presenting
to
the
city
the
beautiful
ground
in
east
bridgeport
now
known
as
washington
park
a
most
attractive
promenade
and
breathing
place
and
a
continual
resort
for
citizens
on
both
sides
of
the
river
particularly
in
the
summer
evenings
when
one
of
the
city
bands
is
an
additional
attraction
to
the
pleasant
spot
thus
our
new
city
was
far
in
advance
of
bridgeport
proper
in
providing
a
prime
necessity
for
the
health
and
amusement
of
the
people
our
park
projects
in
the
city
date
as
far
back
as
the
illustration
year
at
that
time
by
an
arrangement
with
deacon
david
sherwood
who
lived
in
fairfield
a
few
rods
west
of
the
bridgeport
line
and
who
owned
land
adjoining
mine
we
agreed
to
throw
open
a
large
plot
of
ground
free
to
the
public
provided
state
street
in
bridgeport
was
continued
west
so
as
to
pass
through
this
land
but
a
few
old
fogies
through
whose
land
the
street
would
pass
thereby
improving
their
property
thousands
of
dollars
in
value
stupidly
opposed
the
project
in
the
fairfield
and
the
measure
was
defeated
seventeen
years
afterwards
in
after
a
long
sleep
these
same
old
fogies
managed
to
awake
as
did
the
citizens
of
fairfield
generally
and
then
state
street
was
extended
without
opposition
but
property
to
some
extent
had
changed
hands
and
had
largely
increased
in
value
so
that
the
chance
of
having
a
free
park
in
that
locality
was
forever
lost
and
the
town
was
actually
obliged
to
pay
deacon
sherwood
for
the
privilege
of
continuing
the
highway
through
his
land
how
many
similar
opportunities
for
benefiting
the
public
and
posterity
in
all
coming
time
are
carelessly
thrown
away
in
every
town
through
the
mere
stupidity
of
who
stand
as
not
only
in
the
way
of
public
improvements
but
directly
in
opposition
to
their
individual
interests
and
thus
for
scores
of
years
rob
the
community
of
the
pleasures
to
be
derived
from
broad
avenues
lined
with
and
from
open
and
free
public
grounds
up
to
the
year
the
shore
of
bridgeport
west
of
the
public
wharves
and
washed
by
the
waters
of
long
island
sound
was
inaccessible
to
carriages
or
even
to
horsemen
and
almost
impossible
for
pedestrianism
the
shore
edge
in
fact
was
strewn
with
rocks
and
boulders
which
made
it
like
jordan
in
the
song
an
exceedingly
hard
road
to
a
narrow
lane
reaching
down
to
the
shore
enabled
parties
to
drive
near
to
the
water
for
the
purpose
of
clamming
and
occasionally
bathing
but
it
was
all
claimed
as
private
property
by
the
land
proprietors
whose
farms
extended
down
to
the
water
s
edge
on
several
occasions
at
low
tide
i
endeavored
to
ride
along
the
shore
on
horseback
for
the
purpose
of
examining
the
lay
of
the
land
in
the
hope
of
finding
it
feasible
to
get
a
public
drive
along
the
water
s
edge
on
one
occasion
in
i
succeeded
in
getting
my
horse
around
from
the
foot
of
broad
street
in
bridgeport
to
a
lane
over
the
fairfield
line
a
few
rods
west
of
iranistan
avenue
a
grand
street
which
i
have
since
opened
at
my
own
expense
and
through
my
own
land
from
the
observations
i
made
that
day
i
was
satisfied
that
a
most
lovely
park
and
public
drive
might
be
and
ought
to
be
opened
along
the
whole
as
far
as
the
western
boundary
line
of
bridgeport
and
even
extending
over
the
fairfield
line
foreseeing
that
in
a
few
years
such
an
improvement
would
be
too
late
and
having
in
mind
the
failure
of
the
attempt
in
to
provide
a
park
for
the
people
of
bridgeport
i
immediately
began
to
agitate
the
subject
in
the
bridgeport
papers
and
also
in
daily
conversations
with
such
of
my
as
i
thought
would
take
an
earnest
and
immediate
interest
in
the
enterprise
i
urged
that
such
an
improvement
would
increase
the
taxable
value
of
property
in
that
vicinity
many
thousands
of
dollars
and
thus
enrich
the
city
treasury
that
it
would
improve
the
value
of
real
estate
generally
in
the
city
that
it
would
be
an
additional
attraction
to
strangers
who
came
to
spend
the
summer
with
us
and
to
those
who
might
be
induced
from
other
considerations
to
make
the
city
their
permanent
residence
that
the
improvement
would
throw
into
market
some
of
the
most
beautiful
that
could
be
found
anywhere
in
connecticut
and
i
dwelt
upon
the
absurdity
almost
criminality
that
a
beautiful
city
like
bridgeport
lying
on
the
shore
of
a
broad
expanse
of
salt
water
should
so
cage
itself
in
that
not
an
inhabitant
could
approach
the
beach
with
these
and
like
arguments
and
entreaties
i
plied
the
people
day
in
and
day
out
till
some
of
them
began
to
be
familiarized
with
the
idea
that
a
public
park
close
upon
the
shore
of
the
sound
was
at
least
a
possible
if
not
probable
thing
but
certain
conservatives
as
they
are
called
said
barnum
is
a
fellow
who
thinks
he
can
open
and
people
a
broadway
through
a
connecticut
wilderness
and
the
old
fogies
added
yes
he
is
trying
to
start
another
fire
for
the
city
to
blow
forever
but
the
city
or
town
of
bridgeport
will
not
pay
out
money
to
lay
out
or
to
purchase
public
parks
if
people
want
to
see
green
grass
and
trees
they
have
only
to
walk
or
drive
half
a
mile
either
way
from
the
city
limits
and
they
will
come
to
farms
where
they
can
see
either
or
both
for
nothing
and
if
they
are
anxious
to
see
salt
water
and
to
get
a
breath
of
the
sound
breeze
they
can
take
boats
at
the
wharves
and
sail
or
row
till
they
are
entirely
thus
talked
the
conservatives
and
the
old
fogies
who
unhappily
even
if
they
are
in
a
minority
are
always
a
force
in
all
communities
i
soon
saw
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
expect
to
get
the
city
to
pay
for
a
park
the
next
thing
was
to
see
if
the
land
could
not
be
procured
free
of
charge
or
at
a
nominal
cost
provided
the
city
would
improve
and
maintain
it
as
a
public
park
i
approached
the
farmers
who
owned
the
land
lying
immediately
upon
the
shore
and
tried
to
convince
them
that
if
they
would
give
the
city
free
a
deep
slip
next
to
the
water
to
be
used
as
a
public
park
it
would
increase
in
value
the
rest
of
their
land
so
much
as
to
make
it
a
profitable
operation
for
them
but
it
was
like
beating
against
the
wind
they
were
not
so
stupid
as
to
think
that
they
could
become
gainers
by
giving
away
their
such
trials
of
patience
as
i
underwent
in
a
twelvemonth
in
the
endeavor
to
carry
this
point
few
persons
who
have
not
undertaken
like
almost
hopeless
labor
can
comprehend
at
last
i
enlisted
the
attention
of
nathaniel
wheeler
james
loomis
francis
ives
frederick
wood
and
a
few
more
gentlemen
and
persuaded
them
to
walk
with
me
over
the
ground
which
to
me
seemed
in
every
way
practicable
for
a
park
these
gentlemen
who
were
men
of
taste
as
well
as
of
enterprise
and
public
spirit
very
soon
coincided
in
my
ideas
as
to
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
and
the
advantages
of
the
site
and
some
of
them
went
with
me
to
talk
with
the
adding
their
own
pleas
to
the
arguments
i
had
already
advanced
at
last
after
much
pressing
and
persuading
we
got
the
terms
upon
which
the
proprietors
would
give
a
portion
and
sell
another
portion
of
their
land
which
fronted
on
the
water
provided
the
land
thus
disposed
of
should
forever
be
appropriated
to
the
purposes
of
a
public
park
but
unfortunately
a
part
of
the
land
it
was
desirable
to
include
was
the
small
mallett
farm
of
some
thirty
acres
then
belonging
to
an
unsettled
estate
and
neither
the
administrator
nor
the
heirs
could
or
would
give
away
a
rod
of
it
but
the
whole
farm
was
for
sale
and
to
overcome
the
difficulty
in
the
way
of
its
transfer
for
the
public
benefit
i
bought
it
for
about
and
then
presented
the
required
front
to
the
park
i
did
not
want
this
land
or
any
portion
of
it
for
my
own
purposes
or
profit
and
i
offered
a
thousand
dollars
to
any
one
who
would
take
my
place
in
the
transaction
but
no
one
accepted
and
i
was
quite
willing
to
contribute
so
much
of
the
land
as
was
needed
for
so
noble
an
object
indeed
besides
this
i
gave
towards
purchasing
other
land
and
improving
the
park
and
after
months
of
persistent
and
personal
effort
i
succeeded
in
raising
by
private
subscription
the
sum
necessary
to
secure
the
land
needed
this
was
duly
paid
for
deeded
to
and
accepted
by
the
city
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
naming
this
new
and
great
public
improvement
public
journals
are
generally
exponents
of
public
opinion
and
how
the
people
viewed
the
new
purchase
now
their
own
property
may
be
judged
by
the
following
extracts
from
the
leading
local
newspapers
when
the
land
for
the
new
enterprise
was
finally
secured

when
consummated
will
serve
to
amaze
our

to
think
that
such
a
delightful
frontage
has
been
permitted
to
lie
so
long
unimproved
to
barnum
we
believe
is
awarded
the
credit
of
originating
this
beautiful
improvement
and
certainly
to
his
untiring
constant
and
persevering
personal
efforts
are
we
indebted
for
its
being
finally
consummated
hon
james
loomis
was
the
first
man
who
heartily
joined
with
barnum
in
pressing
the
plan
of
a
park
upon
the
attention
of
our
citizens
but
it
is
due
to
our
citizens
themselves
to
say
that
with
an
extraordinary
unanimity
they
have
not
only
voted
to
appropriate
from
the
city
treasury
to
making
the
avenues
around
the
park
and
otherwise
improving
it
but
they
have
also
generously
aided
by
private
contributions
in
purchasing
such
land
as
was
not
freely
given
for
the
park
of
course
we
shall
not
only
at
an
early
day
publish
the
names
of
such
citizens
as
have
subscribed
money
for
this
purpose
but
they
will
also
be
handed
down
to
posterity
as
they
will
richly
deserve
in
the
publication
of
the
park
commissioners
the

august
the
names

capt

have
gone
into

as
the
generous
contributors
to
the
best
enterprise
ever
attempted
for
the
benefit
of
our
city
and
the
city
has
accepted
the
trust
with
the
most
commendable
promptness
and
appointed
its
commissioners
who
have
already
entered
upon
their
duties
we
shall
watch
now
with
eager
interest
the
unfolding
and
development
of
such
a
park
as
can
nowhere
be
found
on
either
side
of
the
sound
and
one
which
shall
be
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
to
our
city
it
needs
but
the
hand
of
skilful
art
assisted
by
a
proper
public
spirit
to
render
the
park
a
charmed
spot
of
delightful
resort

public
drives
or
private
walks
the
commissioners
chosen
to
superintend
the
inauguration
of
the
laying
out
and
improvements
of
the
grounds
are
men
of
correct
taste
of
good
judgment
and
of
liberal
and
comprehensive
views
as
to
the
wants
and
demands
of
a
growing
city
like
bridgeport
they
understand
that
nature
is
here
to
be
made
so
attractive
by
art
that
all
classes
shall
be
drawn
hither
not
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
favorite
resort
but
also
for
the
profit
which
comes
to
the
nobler
impulses
of
our
nature
by
the
contemplation
of
cunning
handicraft
upon
the
landscape
as
god
left
it
for
man
to
adorn
and
beautify

be
planted
trees
of
every
variety
that
will
endure
the
temperature
of
this
latitude
and

of
every
hue

perfume
here
will

serpentine
through
shady
groves
and
anon
lead
out
to
behold
the
broad
expanse
of
the
beautiful
sound
some
one
has
aptly
said
that
one
work

then
let
the
statues
of
the
artist
be
placed
to
educate
the
masses
by
their
silent
teachings
and
win
them
to
higher
ideas
and
better
views
of
life
by
their
mute
eloquence
one
feature
of
american
parks
is
especially
worthy
of
mention
they
are
essentially
and
emphatically
democratic
they
are
made
for
the
people
and
are
in
turn
appreciated
by
the
people
they
are
open
alike
to
the
millionnaire
with
his
and
the
poor
pedestrian
without
a
penny
the
advantages
possessed
by
bridgeport
as
a
manufacturing
city
are
becoming
daily
more
and
more
appreciated
by
from
various
portions
of
the
country
there
is
no
city
in
the
state
which
can
compare
with
ours
in
the
recent
erection
of
large
and
permanent
manufacturing
establishments
this
fact
brings
into
our
midst
a
large
industrial
population
for
which
even
now
the
supply
of
dwellings
is
inadequate
to
the
demand
this
population
commingling
and
combining
with
our
own
and
possessing
energy
enterprise
business
tact
and
intelligence
will
rapidly
develop
the
resources
of
our
city
and
its
surroundings
for
mechanical
pursuits
and
the
productions
of
the
various
manufacturing
establishments
already
erected
or
in
process
of
erection
to
such
a
class
the
benefits
of
a
park
possessing
such
facilities
for
recreation
and
improvement
as
the
park
will
present
will
be
incalculable
in
fostering
the
health
promoting
the
happiness
and
elevating
the
taste
of
all
who
can
avail
themselves
of
its
beneficial
influences
to
the
gentlemen
who
have
so
generously
donated
to
the
city
the
land
for
the
park
bridgeport
owes
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
she
can
never
repay
their
names
will
descend
to
posterity
and
be
remembered
with
pride
and
exultation
as
among
the
noblest
of
public
benefactors
so
long
as
the
flowers
bloom
and
the
waves
wash
the
margin
of
the
park
no
citizen
of
bridgeport
identified
with
her
growth
and
prosperity
and
having
the
future
welfare
of
the
city
at
heart
should
fail
to
contribute
in
such
a
manner
as
best
he
may
to
such
a
grand
improvement
let
our
citizens
take
hold
of
this
noble
enterprise
with
that
large
and
liberal
spirit
in
which
it
has
been
conceived
and
thus
far
consummated
and
bridgeport
will
ere
long
possess
an
attraction
which
will
draw
hither
for
permanent
residence
much
of
the
wealth
and
intelligence
refinement
and
virtue
of
the
great
metropolis
which
now
sequesters
itself
along
the
banks
of
the
hudson
or
among
the
of
new
jersey
thus
was
my
plan
at
length
fulfilled
nor
did
my
efforts
end
here
for
i
aided
and
advised
in
all
important
matters
in
the
laying
out
and
progress
of
the
new
park
and
in
july
i
gave
to
the
city
several
acres
of
land
worth
at
the
lowest
valuation
which
were
added
to
and
included
in
this
public
and
now
make
the
west
end
of
the
park
at
the
beginning
the
park
on
paper
and
the
park
in
reality
were
two
quite
different
things
the
inaccessibility
of
the
site
was
remedied
by
approaches
which
permitted
the
hundreds
of
workmen
to
begin
to
grade
the
grounds
and
to
lay
out
the
walks
and
drives
the
rocks
and
boulders
over
which
i
had
more
than
once
attempted
to
make
my
way
on
foot
and
on
horseback
were
devoted
to
the
building
of
a
substantial
under
the
able
superintendence
of
david
sherwood
paths
were
opened
were
planted
and
fortunately
there
was
in
the
very
centre
of
the
ground
a
beautiful
grove
of
full
growth
which
is
one
of
the
most
attractive
features
of
this
now
charming
spot
and
a
broad
and
magnificent
drive
follows
the
curves
of
the
shore
and
encircles
the
entire
park
although
work
is
constantly
going
on
and
much
remains
to
be
done
yet
a
considerable
portion
of
the
park
presents
a
finished
appearance
a
large
covered
has
been
built
and
on
a
rising
piece
of
the
ground
a
substantial
foundation
has
been
built
for
a
soldiers
monument
the
of
this
monument
was
laid
with
impressive
ceremonies
and
a
military
display
in
the
presence
of
a
large
concourse
of

to
be
the
most
delightful
public

for
these
magnificent
results
accomplished
in

the

to
nathaniel

whose
untiring
energy
and
exquisite
taste
have
been
mainly
instrumental
in

the

is
already
on
a
lesser
scale
to
the
citizens
of
bridgeport
what
the

with

formal
and

career
who
does
not

that
what
in

to
my

life
may

my
private
life
has
also
been
largely
devoted
to
the
comfort
convenience
and
permanent
prosperity
of
the
community
with
which
so
many
of
my
hopes
and
happiest
days
are
thoroughly
identified
i
speak
of
these
things
i
trust
with
becoming
modesty
and
yet
with
less
reluctance
than
i
should
do
if
my
of
bridgeport
had
not
generally
and
generously
awarded
me
sometimes
perhaps
more
than
my
need
of
praise
for
my
unremitting
and
earnest
efforts
to
illustration
promote
whatever
would
conduce
to
the
growth
and
improvement
of
our
charming
city
when
i
first
selected
bridgeport
as
a
permanent
residence
for
my
family
its
nearness
to
new
york
and
the
facilities
for
daily
transit
to
and
from
the
metropolis
were
present
and
partial
considerations
only
in
the
general
advantages
the
location
seemed
to
offer
nowhere
in
all
my
travels
in
america
and
abroad
had
i
seen
a
city
whose
very
position
presented
so
many
and
varied
attractions
situated
on
long
island
sound
with
that
vast
in
front
and
on
every
other
side
a
beautiful
and
fertile
country
with
every
variety
of
inland
scenery
and
charming
drives
which
led
through
valleys
rich
with
farms
and
over
hills
with
forests
of
primeval
growth
all
these
natural
attractions
appeared
to
me
only
so
many
aids
to
the
advancement
the
beautiful
and
busy
city
might
attain
if
enterprise
and
money
grasped
and
improved
the
opportunities
the
locality
itself
extended
i
saw
that
what
nature
had
so
freely
lavished
must
be
supplemented
by
yet
more
liberal
art
consequently
and
quite
naturally
when
i
projected
and
established
my
first
residence
in
bridgeport
i
was
exceedingly
desirous
that
all
the
surroundings
of
iranistan
should
accord
with
the
beauty
and
completeness
of
that
place
i
was
never
a
victim
to
that
mania
which
possesses
many
men
of
even
moderate
means
to
own
everything
that
joins
them
and
i
knew
that
iranistan
would
so
increase
the
value
of
surrounding
property
that
none
but
residences
would
be
possible
in
the
vicinity
but
there
was
other
work
to
do
which
while
affording
advantageous
approaches
to
my
property
would
at
the
same
time
be
a
lasting
benefit
to
the
public
and
so
i
opened
iranistan
avenue
and
other
broad
and
beautiful
streets
through
land
which
i
freely
purchased
and
as
freely
gave
to
the
public
and
these
highways
are
now
the
most
convenient
as
well
as
charming
in
the
city
to
have
opened
all
these
new
avenues
in
their
entire
length
at
my
own
cost
and
through
my
own
ground
would
have
required
a
confirmation
of
miss
lavinia
warren
s
opinion
that
what
little
of
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
the
adjacent
town
of
fairfield
was
not
owned
by
general
tom
thumb
belonged
to
barnum
it
is
true
that
apart
from
my
east
bridgeport
property
i
became
a
very
large
owner
of
real
estate
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
bridgeport
proper
and
in
fairfield
my
purchases
in
fairfield
lying
on
and
so
near
to
the
boundary
line
division
street
as
virtually
to
be
in
bridgeport
everywhere
through
my
own
lands
i
laid
out
and
threw
open
to
the
public
streets
of
the
generous
width
which
distinguished
the
old
king
s
roads
in
the
colonies
before
grasping
farmers
and
others
encroached
upon
and
fenced
in
as
private
property
land
that
really
belonged
to
the
public
forever
and
on
both
sides
of
every
avenue
i
laid
out
and
planted
a
profusion
of
elms
and
other
trees
in
this
way
i
have
opened
miles
of
new
streets
and
have
planted
thousands
of
in
bridgeport
for
i
think
there
is
much
wisdom
in
the
advice
of
the
laird
of
dumbiedikes
in
scott
s
heart
of
who
sensibly
says
when
ye
hae
naething
else
to
do
ye
may
be
aye
sticking
in
a
tree
it
will
be
growing
when
ye
re
but
in
establishing
new
streets
too
often
when
i
had
gone
through
my
own
land
the
project
came
literally
to
an
end
some
old
fogy
blocked
the
way
my
way
his
own
way
and
the
highway
and
all
i
could
do
would
be
to
jump
over
his
field
and
continue
my
new
street
through
land
i
might
own
on
the
other
side
till
i
reached
the
desired
terminus
in
the
end
or
continuation
of
some
other
street
or
till
unhappily
i
came
to
a
dead
at
the
ground
of
some
other
old
fogy
who
like
the
original
owners
of
what
is
now
the
of
park
did
not
believe
there
was
money
to
be
made
by
giving
away
their
and
this
is
the
manner
in
which
these
old
fogies
talked
we
don
t
believe
in
these
improvements
of
barnum
s
what
s
the
use
of
them
we
can
get
to
the
city
by
the
old
road
or
street
as
we
have
done
for
forty
years
the
new
street
will
cut
the
pasture
or
in
two
and
make
a
checkerboard
of
the
farm
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
the
railroad
go
through
and
we
would
have
prevented
that
if
we
could
but
this
new
street
business
is
all
bosh
and
then
singularly
enough
every
old
fogy
would
wind
up
with
i
declare
i
believe
the
whole
thing
is
only
to
benefit
barnum
so
that
he
can
sell
land
which
he
bought
anywhere
from
sixty
to
two
hundred
dollars
an
acre
at
the
rate
of
five
thousand
dollars
an
acre
in
as
he
is
actually
doing
it
is
strange
indeed
that
these
men
who
could
see
the
benefit
to
barnum
s
property
by
opening
new
streets
which
would
immediately
convert
cheap
farm
and
pasture
land
into
choice
and
should
not
see
that
precisely
the
same
thing
would
proportionately
increase
the
value
of
their
own
property
conservatism
may
be
a
good
thing
in
the
state
or
in
the
church
but
it
is
fatal
to
the
growth
of
cities
and
the
conservative
notions
of
old
fogies
make
them
indifferent
to
the
requirements
which
a
very
few
years
in
the
future
will
compel
and
blind
to
their
own
best
interests
such
men
never
look
beyond
the
length
of
their
noses
and
consider
every
investment
a
dead
loss
unless
they
can
get
the
sixpence
profit
into
their
pockets
before
they
go
to
bed
my
own
long
training
and
experience
as
a
manager
impelled
me
to
carry
into
such
private
enterprises
as
the
purchase
of
real
estate
that
best
and
most
essential
managerial
quality
of
instantly
deciding
not
only
whether
a
venture
was
worth
undertaking
but
what
all
things
considered
that
venture
would
result
in
almost
any
man
can
see
how
a
thing
will
begin
but
not
every
man
is
gifted
with
the
foresight
to
see
how
it
will
end
or
how
with
the
proper
effort
it
may
be
made
to
end
in
east
bridgeport
where
we
had
no
conservatives
to
contend
with
we
were
only
a
few
years
in
turning
almost
tenantless
farms
into
a
populous
and
prosperous
city
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
while
the
opening
of
new
avenues
the
planting
of
and
the
building
of
many
houses
have
afforded
me
the
highest
pleasures
of
my
life
i
confess
that
not
a
few
of
my
greatest
annoyances
have
been
occasioned
by
the
opposition
of
those
who
seem
to
be
content
to
simply
vegetate
through
their
existence
and
who
looked
upon
me
as
a
restless
reckless
innovator
because
i
was
trying
to
remove
the
moss
from
everything
around
them
and
even
from
their
own
eyes
in
the
summer
of
the
health
of
my
wife
continuing
to
decline
her
physician
directed
that
she
should
remove
nearer
to
the
and
as
she
felt
that
the
care
of
a
large
establishment
like
lindencroft
was
more
than
she
could
bear
i
sold
that
place
i
have
already
spoken
of
my
building
of
this
residence
it
was
emphatically
a
labor
of
love
all
that
taste
and
money
could
do
was
fairly
lavished
upon
lindencroft
so
that
when
all
was
finished
it
was
not
only
a
complete
house
in
all
respects
but
it
was
a
perfect
home
and
a
home
i
meant
it
to
be
in
every
and
the
best
sense
of
the
word
for
my
declining
years
consequently
from
basement
to
attic
everything
was
constructed
by
days
work
in
the
most
perfect
manner
possible
convenience
and
comfort
were
first
consulted
and
thereafter
with
no
attempt
at
ostentation
elegance
pure
and
simple
predominated
and
permeated
everywhere
no
house
in
the
metropolis
was
more
replete
with
all
that
goes
to
constitute
a
complete
under
this
new
roof
i
gathered
my
library
my
pictures
my
souvenirs
of
travel
in
other
lands
and
assembled
my
household
gods
while
the
surrounding
grounds
adorned
with
statuary
and
fountains
displayed
also
in
the
walks
the
arbors
the
lawns
the
garden
the
rocks
even
the
profusion
of
trees
and
shrubbery
and
the
wealth
of
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
my
wife
s
exquisite
taste
which
in
times
past
had
made
the
grounds
of
our
loved
and
lost
iranistan
so
celebrated
as
well
as
charming
it
was
hard
indeed
to
tear
ourselves
from
this
fascinating
spot
but
there
are
times
when
even
the
charms
of
home
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
claims
of
health
lindencroft
was
sold
july
and
we
immediately
removed
for
a
summer
s
sojourn
to
a
small
adjoining
park
during
the
hot
days
of
the
next
three
months
we
found
the
delightful
so
bracing
and
refreshing
that
the
season
passed
like
a
happy
dream
and
we
resolved
that
our
future
summers
should
be
spent
on
the
very
shore
of
long
island
sound
i
did
not
however
perfect
my
arrangements
in
time
to
prepare
my
own
summer
residence
for
the
ensuing
season
and
during
the
hot
months
of
we
resided
in
a
new
and
very
pretty
house
i
had
just
completed
on
state
street
in
bridgeport
and
which
i
subsequently
sold
as
i
intended
doing
when
i
built
it
but
towards
the
end
of
the
summer
i
added
by
purchase
to
the
mallett
farm
adjoining
park
a
large
and
beautiful
hickory
grove
which
seemed
to
be
all
that
was
needed
to
make
the
site
exactly
what
i
desired
for
a
summer
residence
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
bought
this
mallett
farm
not
for
myself
but
so
that
a
portion
of
it
could
be
devoted
to
the
public
park
and
a
generous
slice
having
been
thus
given
away
there
were
several
acres
remaining
which
were
admirably
adapted
to
one
or
more
residences
and
the
purchase
of
the
grove
property
made
the
location
nearly
perfect
but
there
was
a
vast
deal
to
do
in
grading
and
preparing
the
ground
in
opening
new
streets
and
avenues
as
approaches
to
the
property
and
in
setting
out
trees
near
the
proposed
site
of
the
house
so
that
ground
was
not
broken
for
the
foundation
till
october
i
planned
a
house
which
should
combine
the
greatest
convenience
with
the
highest
comfort
keeping
in
mind
always
that
houses
are
made
to
live
in
as
well
as
to
look
at
and
to
be
homes
rather
than
mere
residences
so
the
house
was
made
to
include
abundant
room
for
guests
with
and
baths
to
every
chamber
water
from
the
city
throughout
the
premises
gas
manufactured
on
my
own
ground
and
that
greatest
of
all
comforts
a
kitchen
so
that
the
smell
as
well
as
the
secrets
of
the
cuisine
might
be
confined
to
its
own
locality
the
stables
and
gardens
were
located
far
from
the
mansion
on
the
opposite
side
of
one
of
the
newly
opened
avenues
so
that
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
house
on
either
side
and
before
both
fronts
stretched
large
lawns
broken
only
by
the
grove
single
walks
and
drives
the
whole
scheme
as
planned
was
faithfully
carried
out
in
less
than
eight
months
the
first
foundation
stone
was
laid
in
october
and
we
moved
into
the
completed
house
in
june
following
in
it
required
a
regiment
of
faithful
laborers
and
mechanics
and
a
very
considerable
expenditure
of
money
to
accomplish
so
much
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
those
who
saw
a
comparatively
barren
waste
thus
suddenly
converted
to
a
blooming
garden
and
by
the
successful
transplanting
and
judicious
placing
of
very
large
and
forest
trees
made
to
seem
like
a
place
considered
the
creation
of
my
new
summer
home
almost
a
work
of
magic
but
there
is
no
magic
when
determination
and
dollars
combine
to
achieve
a
work
when
we
moved
into
this
new
residence
we
formally
christened
the
place
waldemere
literally
but
not
so
euphoniously
waldammeer
for
i
preferred
to
give
this
native
child
of
my
own
conception
an
american
name
of
my
own
creation
on
the
same
estate
and
fronting
the
new
avenue
i
opened
between
my
own
property
and
the
public
park
i
built
at
the
same
time
two
beautiful
cottages
one
of
which
is
known
as
the
petrel
s
nest
and
the
other
occupied
by
my
eldest
daughter
thompson
and
my
youngest
daughter
seeley
as
a
summer
residence
is
called
from
the
east
front
of
waldemere
across
the
sloping
lawn
and
through
the
reaches
of
the
grove
these
cottages
are
in
sight
and
before
the
three
residences
stretches
the
broad
sound
with
nothing
to
cut
off
the
view
and
nothing
intervening
but
the
western
portion
of
park
and
however
do
not
include
the
sum
of
rural
felicities
in
summer
and
so
i
still
keep
possession
of
the
fine
farm
which
years
ago
was
the
scene
of
the
feats
on
this
property
which
is
in
charge
of
a
judicious
farmer
i
have
some
very
fine
imported
stock
including
several
head
of
the
celebrated
dutch
cattle
which
excite
the
curiosity
and
attract
the
attention
of
all
who
see
them
these
cattle
are
black
with
a
distinctly
defined
white
blanket
around
their
bodies
giving
them
a
very
unique
appearance
and
when
they
struck
my
fancy
in
holland
some
years
ago
i
imported
several
of
them
nor
is
their
singular
appearance
their
best
recommendation
for
they
are
excellent
milkers
and
my
dairy
and
farm
products
keep
my
table
constantly
supplied
with
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
poultry
and
that
choicest
of
country
luxuries
pure
cream
amid
such
comforts
advantages
and
luxuries
the
summer
months
speed
swiftly
and
sweetly
by
my
stables
afford
the
means
of
enjoying
the
numberless
delightful
drives
which
abound
in
the
vicinity
and
my
friend
george
a
wells
is
always
ready
to
minister
to
the
pleasure
of
myself
or
my
guests
by
tendering
the
use
of
anything
in
his
sound
fleet
from
a
to
a
yacht
the
five
months
in
the
year
which
i
devote
to
rural
rest
seem
all
too
short
for
the
enjoyment
which
is
necessarily
compressed
in
the
twenty
weeks
but
i
can
feel
at
the
end
of
the
season
that
it
is
a
consolidation
as
well
as
compression
not
only
of
pleasure
but
of
capital
in
the
way
of
health
and
vigor
for
the
winter
s
campaign
of
city
living
and
metropolitan
excitement
for
at
my
time
of
life
and
especially
for
a
man
who
has
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
metropolitan
million
as
i
have
done
i
am
convinced
that
the
city
is
the
most
congenial
residence
during
the
cooler
season
of
the
year
no
matter
how
active
may
have
been
one
s
life
as
a
man
grows
older
if
he
does
not
become
a
little
lazy
he
at
least
learns
to
crave
for
comfortable
ease
and
seeks
for
quiet
to
such
a
man
the
city
in
winter
extends
numberless
pleasures
there
is
a
sense
of
satisfaction
even
in
the
sidewalks
after
a
and
an
almost
selfish
happiness
in
looking
out
upon
a
storm
from
a
library
or
parlor
window
one
loves
to
find
the
morning
papers
fresh
from
the
press
lying
upon
the
and
the
city
is
the
centre
of
attractions
in
the
way
of
operas
concerts
libraries
the
best
music
the
best
preaching
the
best
of
everything
in
Ã¦sthetical
enjoyments
having
made
up
my
mind
to
spend
seven
months
of
every
year
in
the
city
in
the
summer
of
i
purchased
the
elegant
and
most
eligibly
situated
mansion
no
fifth
avenue
corner
of
street
at
the
crowning
point
of
murray
hill
in
new
york
and
moved
into
it
in
november
my
residence
therein
in
the
winter
season
has
fully
confirmed
my
impressions
in
its
favor
the
house
is
replete
with
all
that
can
constitute
a
pleasant
home
and
the
location
is
so
near
to
central
park
that
we
spend
hours
of
every
fine
day
in
that
great
while
i
am
in
town
it
is
scarcely
more
than
once
or
twice
a
week
that
i
take
pains
to
ascertain
by
personal
observation
that
i
am
living
on
the
edge
of
a
toiling
excited
city
of
a
million
inhabitants
my
pecuniary
interests
in
connecticut
and
in
new
york
occupy
my
attention
sufficiently
to
keep
me
from
and
an
extended
correspondence
for
which
i
do
not
yet
feel
the
need
of
a
private
secretary
employs
an
hour
or
more
of
every
day
i
have
had
letters
from
new
zealand
and
other
remote
quarters
of
the
globe
respecting
curiosities
and
addressed
simply
to
mr
barnum
america
and
the
officials
knowing
of
no
other
barnum
who
would
be
likely
to
receive
letters
from
such
places
regularly
put
these
vaguely
addressed
letters
in
my
new
york
box
yet
i
suppose
that
not
less
than
of
all
the
letters
i
receive
are
earnest
petitions
for
pecuniary
aid
this
business
began
to
persecute
me
as
long
ago
as
the
time
of
the
jenny
lind
engagement
and
even
before
many
of
these
letters
ask
money
as
a
free
gift
and
some
of
them
demand
assistance
while
others
request
temporary
loans
or
invite
me
to
furnish
the
capital
for
enterprises
which
are
certain
to
bring
the
richest
returns
to
all
concerned
therein
when
i
was
travelling
with
jenny
lind
i
received
a
letter
from
a
woman
in
pittsburg
pennsylvania
who
informed
me
that
she
had
named
her
twins
p
barnum
and
jenny
lind
coolly
adding
that
we
might
send
for
their
immediate
wants
and
make
such
provision
for
their
future
education
and
support
as
might
be
determined
upon
at
the
proper
time
in
some
of
these
letters
the
amusement
afforded
by
the
orthography
and
grammar
was
almost
a
compensation
for
the
annoyance
and
impudence
of
the
requests
one
very
bad
speller
referring
me
to
a
former
employer
of
the
wrote
i
can
rephurr
you
too
him
another
urging
his
petition
declared
god
nose
i
am
poore
and
not
long
ago
i
received
a
communication
from
an
old
man
who
claimed
to
be
too
decrepid
to
earn
a
support
but
he
urged
that
he
was
a
religious
man
and
added
i
tak
grait
pleshur
in
readin
my
bibel
speshily
the
proffits
and
it
did
look
a
little
as
if
he
had
a
sharp
eye
to
the
i
have
said
but
little
in
these
pages
of
the
immediate
circle
which
is
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
my
wife
with
whom
i
have
lived
so
many
happy
years
and
who
has
been
my
support
in
adversity
and
my
solace
in
prosperity
still
survives
our
children
are
all
daughters
caroline
the
eldest
was
married
to
david
thompson
october
helen
my
second
daughter
was
married
to
samuel
hurd
october
frances
the
third
daughter
was
born
may
and
died
april
and
pauline
the
fourth
daughter
was
married
on
her
birthday
march
to
nathan
seeley
for
my
eldest
daughter
i
built
and
furnished
a
beautiful
house
on
ground
near
iranistan
and
she
moved
into
it
immediately
after
her
marriage
though
of
late
years
she
has
resided
in
in
winter
and
in
bridgeport
in
summer
for
helen
and
pauline
i
bought
and
furnished
handsome
houses
in
lexington
avenue
in
within
a
short
distance
of
my
own
city
residence
in
fifth
avenue
a
fine
young
rising
generation
of
my
grandchildren
is
growing
up
around
them
and
me
i
have
written
as
little
as
might
be
too
about
my
religious
principles
and
profession
because
i
agree
with
the
man
who
in
answer
to
the
pressing
inquiry
declared
that
he
had
no
religion
to
of
and
i
believe
with
him
that
true
religion
is
more
a
matter
of
work
than
of
words
when
i
am
in
the
city
i
regularly
attend
the
services
and
preaching
of
the
rev
chapin
and
i
usually
go
to
the
meetings
of
the
same
denomination
in
bridgeport
he
builds
too
low
who
builds
beneath
the
skies
and
i
can
truly
say
that
i
have
always
felt
my
entire
dependence
upon
him
who
is
the
dispenser
of
all
adversity
as
well
as
the
giver
of
all
good
with
a
natural
proclivity
to
look
upon
the
bright
side
of
things
i
am
sure
that
under
some
of
the
burdens
the
jerome
entanglement
for
instance
which
have
borne
so
heavily
upon
me
i
should
have
been
tempted
as
others
have
been
to
suicide
if
i
had
supposed
that
my
troubles
were
brought
upon
me
by
mere
blind
chance
i
knew
that
i
deserved
what
i
received
i
had
placed
too
much
confidence
in
mere
money
and
my
own
personal
efforts
i
was
too
much
concerned
in
material
prosperity
and
i
felt
that
the
blow
was
wisely
intended
for
my
ultimate
benefit
a
chastening
which
like
the
husks
to
the
prodigal
son
should
cause
me
to
come
to
myself
and
teach
me
the
lesson
that
there
is
something
infinitely
better
than
money
or
position
or
worldly
prosperity
in
our
father
s
and
i
should
be
ungrateful
indeed
if
on
my
birthday
this
fifth
of
july
when
i
enter
upon
my
sixtieth
year
in
full
health
and
vigor
with
the
possibility
of
many
happy
days
to
come
i
did
not
reverently
recognize
the
beneficent
hand
that
has
crowned
me
with
so
many
comforts
and
surrounded
me
with
so
many
blessings
it
is
on
this
day
in
my
own
beautiful
home
of
waldemere
that
i
write
these
concluding
lines
which
record
a
long
and

of

fifth
his
ambition
gratified
to
satiety
in
the
conquest
of
kingdoms
and
the
firm
establishment
of
his
empire
he
craved
rest
he
abdicated
his
throne
retired
from
business
content
to
live
on
his
laurels
in
the
peaceful
shades
of
the
cloister
at
yustee
the
tradition
is
that
here
he
forgot
the
world
without
withdrew
in
thought
as
in
person
from
the
cares
and
turmoils
of
state
and
found
rest
and
cheerfulness
by
alternating
his
devotions
with
the
tinkering
of
clocks
perhaps
every
one
is
not
so
familiar
with
the
somewhat
recent
correction
by
stirling
of
this
romantic
story
in
fact
the
emperor
was
never
so
restless
as
when
he
was
taking
rest
was
never
so
full
of
the
perplexities
of
empire
as
when
in
due
form
he
had
shaken
them
off
in
the
cloister
he
was
the
same
man
that
he
was
in
the
camp
and
the
court
and
when
he
sought
to
repress
his
energies
they
simply
tormented
him
not
denying
that
my
egotism
is
equal
to
a
good
deal
i
must
beg
my
readers
not
to
suppose
that
i
assume
for
my
own
history
a
very
extended
similarity
to
that
of
the
greatest
monarch
of
his
time
in
fact
the
points
of
difference
are
quite
as
striking
as
those
of
resemblance
it
is
true
we
both
tried
the
clock
business
but
i
must
claim
that
my
tinkering
in
that
way
throws
that
of
the
emperor
entirely
in
the
shade
i
was
not
however
fool
enough
to
go
into
a
cloister
let
not
an
illustration
any
more
than
a
parable
run
on
all
but
i
want
a
royal
illustration
and
the
history
of
charles
the
fifth
in
the
particular
of
abdicating
for
rest
i
find
very
pertinent
to
my
own
experience
i
took
a
formal
and
as
i
then
supposed
a
last
adieu
of
my
readers
on
my
i
was
as
i
had
flattered
myself
through
with
travel
with
adventure
and
with
business
save
so
far
as
the
care
of
my
competence
would
require
my
attention
my
book
closed
without
a
suspicion
that
in
any
subsequent
edition
more
of
the
same
sort
would
make
possible
an
additional
chapter
it
is
with
a
sense
of
surprise
and
withal
a
feeling
akin
to
the
ludicrous
that
in
this
new
edition
i
can
not
bring
my
career
up
to
my
year
without
filling
a
few
more
pages
in
their
contents
not
unlike
in
kind
to
those
which
make
the
bulk
of
my
book
as
stated
on
page
my
final
retirement
from
the
managerial
profession
closed
with
the
destruction
of
my
museum
by
fire
march
but
when
i
wrote
that
sentence
i
had
not
learned
by
a
three
years
cessation
of
business
how
utterly
fruitless
it
is
to
attempt
to
chain
down
energies
which
are
peculiar
to
my
nature
no
man
not
similarly
situated
can
imagine
the
which
seizes
such
a
nature
after
it
has
lain
dormant
for
a
few
months
having
nothing
to
do
i
thought
at
first
was
a
very
pleasant
as
it
was
to
me
an
entirely
new
sensation
i
would
like
to
call
on
you
in
the
summer
if
you
have
any
leisure
in
bridgeport
said
an
old
friend
i
am
a
man
of
leisure
and
thankful
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
so
you
can
not
call
amiss
i
replied
with
an
immense
degree
of
where
is
your
office
when
you
live
in
new
york
asked
another
friend
i
have
no
office
i
proudly
replied
i
have
done
work
enough
and
shall
play
the
rest
of
my
life
i
don
t
go
once
a
week
but
i
ride
in
the
park
every
day
and
am
at
home
much
of
my
i
am
afraid
that
i
chuckled
often
when
i
saw
rich
merchants
and
bankers
driving
to
their
offices
on
a
stormy
morning
while
i
looking
complacently
from
the
window
of
my
cozy
library
said
to
myself
let
it
snow
and
blow
there
s
nothing
to
call
out
but
nature
assert
herself
reading
is
pleasant
as
a
pastime
writing
without
any
special
purpose
soon
tires
a
game
of
chess
will
answer
as
a
condiment
lectures
concerts
operas
and
dinner
parties
are
well
enough
in
their
way
but
to
a
robust
healthy
man
of
forty
years
active
life
something
else
is
needed
to
satisfy
sometimes
like
the
truant
i
found
all
my
friends
engaged
and
i
had
no
i
began
to
fill
my
house
with
visitors
and
yet
frequently
we
spent
evenings
quite
alone
without
really
perceiving
what
the
matter
was
time
hung
on
my
hands
and
i
was
ready
to
lecture
gratuitously
for
every
charitable
cause
that
i
could
benefit
then
i
who
had
travelled
so
many
years
that
almost
all
cities
seemed
to
me
as
the
same
old
brick
and
mortar
began
now
to
think
i
would
like
to
travel
in
the
autumn
of
after
my
family
had
moved
for
the
winter
from
bridgeport
to
our
new
york
residence
an
english
friend
came
with
his
eldest
daughter
to
america
especially
to
visit
me
this
friend
was
john
fish
and
he
is
an
old
friend
of
the
reader
also
for
he
is
the
enterprising
proprietor
of
bury
england
fully
described
in
chapter
xxxii
of
this
book
in
which
he
is
mentioned
as
mr
when
i
was
writing
that
chapter
i
had
no
authority
to
append
his
real
name
to
the
faithful
photograph
of
the
man
but
mr
fish
gives
me
his
consent
to
use
it
now
i
need
not
say
how
pleased
i
was
to
see
my
friend
and
how
happy
i
was
to
show
a
representative
englishman
whatever
was
worth
seeing
in
the
metropolis
and
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
after
enjoying
the
christmas
and
new
year
s
festivities
in
new
york
taking
numerous
drives
in
our
beautiful
central
park
including
several
which
to
them
were
real
novelties
going
the
rounds
of
the
metropolitan
amusements
and
doing
the
city
in
general
and
in
detail
my
english
friends
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
new
world
and
i
was
just
in
the
humor
to
act
as
the
exhibitor
in
fact
i
now
resumed
my
old
business
of
systematically
organizing
an
extensive
travelling
expedition
and
almost
unconsciously
became
a
showman
of
natural
curiosities
on
a
most
magnificent
scale
we
first
went
to
niagara
falls
going
by
the
hudson
river
and
central
railroads
and
returned
by
way
of
the
erie
i
saw
these
scenes
through
the
eyes
of
my
english
friends
and
took
a
special
pleasure
in
witnessing
their
surprise
and
delight
as
they
extolled
the
beautiful
hudson
that
stream
looked
lovelier
than
ever
the
catskill
mountains
were
higher
to
me
than
ever
before
for
the
same
reason
albany
syracuse
and
rochester
were
more
lively
than
usual
the
mammoth
international
hotel
at
niagara
falls
looked
capacious
enough
to
bag
the
entire
islands
of
great
britain
and
the
immense
cataract
seemed
large
enough
to
drown
all
the
inhabitants
thereof
the
palace
cars
of
the
erie
railroad
astonished
my
friends
and
gave
me
great
satisfaction
the
contagion
of
their
enthusiasm
opened
my
eyes
to
marvels
in
spectacles
which
i
had
long
dismissed
as
commonplace
they
wanted
to
go
to
cuba
i
had
been
there
twice
yet
i
readily
agreed
to
accompany
them
we
took
steamer
from
new
york
in
january
we
had
a
smooth
pleasant
voyage
and
did
not
even
know
when
we
passed
cape
hatteras
in
three
days
we
had
doffed
all
winter
clothing
and
arrayed
ourselves
in
white
linen
three
weeks
were
most
truly
enjoyed
among
the
novel
scenes
of
havana
and
the
peculiar
attractions
of
mantanzas
including
a
visit
to
the
new
and
beautiful
cave
a
few
miles
from
that
city
we
made
a
charming
visit
to
a
coffee
plantation
and
orange
orchard
another
to
a
sugar
plantation
where
my
english
friends
as
well
as
myself
were
shocked
to
see
the
negro
slaves
male
and
female
boys
and
girls
cutting
and
carrying
the
sugar
cane
under
the
lash
of
the
mounted
booted
and
spurred
spanish
overseer
but
riding
in
our
charming
volantes
from
that
plantation
to
the
exceedingly
beautiful
valley
of
the
yumurri
caused
us
almost
to
forget
the
sad
scene
we
had
witnessed
we
all
agreed
as
we
stood
on
the
east
side
of
this
almost
celestial
valley
and
witnessed
the
sun
dropping
behind
the
hill
on
whose
summit
the
royal
palms
were
holding
up
their
beautiful
plumes
that
the
valley
below
interspersed
with
its
cottages
and
streamlets
and
its
rich
tropical
trees
shrubs
and
flowers
was
a
scene
of
surpassing
loveliness
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
the
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
roll
down
the
cheeks
of
the
young
english
lady
i
enjoyed
the
scene
hugely
but
as
one
evidence
that
this
pleasure
was
derived
from
the
enjoyment
it
afforded
my
friends
i
will
say
that
when
i
was
in
cuba
with
jenny
lind
in
i
witnessed
the
same
scene
without
emotion
so
absorbed
was
i
in
business
at
that
time
and
this
is
a
fitting
opportunity
for
saying
that
in
order
to
enjoy
travelling
and
indeed
almost
anything
else
it
is
of
the
very
first
importance
that
it
be
done
without
care
and
with
congenial
companions
we
feasted
upon
oranges
pine
apples
bananas
and
other
tropical
fruits
and
enjoyed
the
warm
mild
days
the
enjoyment
was
no
doubt
enhanced
or
at
least
better
appreciated
by
our
reading
of
the
freezing
condition
of
our
new
york
friends
the
quaint
buildings
and
the
novel
manners
and
customs
of
a
nation
speaking
a
different
language
from
our
own
of
course
are
interesting
for
a
short
time
we
went
to
new
orleans
by
steamer
we
stopped
a
few
days
at
the
charles
hotel
did
the
city
and
then
took
passage
for
memphis
on
a
steamer
which
was
so
capacious
and
commodious
that
my
english
friends
declared
that
people
at
home
would
scarce
believe
it
was
a
steamer
a
few
days
sail
up
the
broad
mississippi
was
a
real
treat
the
conversations
which
my
english
friend
held
with
the
southern
planters
and
their
manumitted
slaves
caused
him
to
somewhat
change
his
opinions
in
regard
to
the
merits
of
our
late
civil
war
from
memphis
we
went
by
rail
to
the
mammoth
cave
of
kentucky
thence
to
louisville
cincinnati
pittsburgh
harrisburgh
baltimore
and
washington
a
few
days
sojourn
at
the
best
hotel
in
the
world
the
arlington
a
visit
to
all
the
attractions
in
and
around
our
national
capital
including
attendance
at
president
grant
s
levee
and
a
talk
with
the
president
and
with
numerous
senators
and
members
of
congress
terminated
our
visit
we
then
proceeded
to
richmond
for
my
friend
fish
had
a
great
desire
to
see
the
confederate
capital
and
especially
libby
prison
and
castle
he
was
almost
indignant
when
he
discovered
that
the
latter
institution
was
a
tobacco
warehouse
instead
of
being
a
great
castellated
fortress
such
as
his
imagination
had
pictured
it
from
richmond
we
visited
baltimore
and
philadelphia
and
returned
to
new
york
in
april
we
made
up
a
small
congenial
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
visited
california
the
union
and
central
pacific
railroads
and
here
let
me
say
that
this
trip
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
i
ever
made
the
pullman
palace
cars
are
so
convenient
and
comfortable
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
can
make
the
trip
to
california
a
distance
of
miles
with
no
more
real
fatigue
than
they
will
experience
in
their
own
drawing
rooms
they
can
dress
in
read
lounge
write
converse
play
a
social
game
sleep
or
do
what
they
choose
while
a
great
portion
of
the
route
affords
a
constant
succession
of
novel
and
delightful
scenes
to
be
witnessed
nowhere
else
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
say
emphatically
that
for
every
person
who
can
afford
it
the
trip
to
california
is
one
that
ought
by
all
means
to
be
made
like
a
thing
of
beauty
it
will
prove
a
joy
when
our
party
arrived
at
san
francisco
they
all
agreed
in
saying
that
if
they
were
compelled
to
return
home
the
next
day
they
should
feel
that
they
were
well
paid
for
their
journey
in
view
of
the
strange
and
interesting
scenes
we
witnessed
in
salt
lake
city
a
place
in
many
respects
unlike
any
other
in
the
world
and
in
fresh
remembrance
of
the
wild
bold
rocky
mountain
scenery
the
vast
plains
the
wild
antelope
buffalo
and
wolves
the
mining
districts
the
curious
snow
sheds
and
many
other
scenes
and
peculiar
things
brought
to
our
notice
i
think
my
friends
were
right
in
their
conclusions
we
took
our
journey
leisurely
i
lectured
in
council
bluffs
in
omaha
and
in
salt
lake
city
we
stopped
several
days
in
this
celebrated
mormon
city
and
as
i
wished
without
prejudice
to
examine
into
the
habits
customs
and
opinions
of
the
mormons
we
put
up
at
the
townsend
house
a
very
excellent
hotel
kept
by
townsend
a
new
england
mormon
with
three
or
more
wives
one
of
the
principal
mormons
an
alderman
and
an
apostle
had
visited
me
in
new
york
he
devoted
his
time
to
our
party
for
several
successive
days
and
through
his
courtesy
and
influence
we
were
furnished
facilities
for
obtaining
information
that
not
one
stranger
in
a
thousand
ever
enjoys
we
not
only
visited
the
tabernacle
and
all
the
institutions
civil
and
religious
but
were
introduced
into
the
families
of
several
of
the
dignitaries
in
turn
we
were
visited
at
our
hotel
by
all
the
principal
church
officers
without
stopping
to
discuss
their
great
error
a
plurality
of
wives
i
must
say
that
all
of
our
party
agreed
that
the
mormons
of
salt
lake
city
were
an
industrious
quiet
seemingly
conscientious
peaceable
people
a
serious
defection
has
taken
place
in
their
church
the
portion
called
the
liberals
have
renounced
polygamy
for
the
future
and
this
example
together
with
their
rejection
of
certain
theological
superstitions
is
giving
them
great
influence
and
respect
this
branch
of
the
mormons
is
growing
rapidly
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
their
influence
aided
by
the
great
influx
of
gentiles
caused
by
the
pacific
railroad
will
soon
serve
in
exterminating
the
plurality
wife
system
unless
unhappily
fanatics
and
fools
give
this
system
renewed
strength
by
recklessly
persecuting
its
devotees
to
martyrdom
i
lectured
in
the
salt
lake
theatre
a
large
and
commodious
building
belonging
to
the
mormons
a
dozen
or
so
of
brigham
young
s
wives
and
scores
of
his
children
were
among
the
audience
as
i
came
out
of
the
theatre
one
of
the
apostles
introduced
me
to
five
of
his
wives
in
succession
the
mormon
wives
whom
i
visited
in
company
of
their
husbands
expressed
themselves
pleased
with
their
positions
but
i
confess
i
doubt
their
sincerity
on
this
point
all
with
whom
our
party
conversed
and
some
of
our
ladies
talked
with
these
mormon
wives
in
secret
expressed
their
solemn
conviction
that
polygamy
was
the
only
true
domestic
system
sanctioned
by
the
almighty
although
they
confessed
they
wished
it
was
right
for
a
man
to
have
but
one
wife
i
was
introduced
by
her
father
to
a
girl
of
seventeen
named
barnum
the
old
man
was
an
original
mormon
he
had
moved
from
illinois
with
brigham
young
and
his
disciples
when
they
were
driven
out
and
compelled
to
make
that
wonderful
and
fearful
journey
over
the
plains
the
daughter
was
born
in
salt
lake
city
and
of
course
knew
nothing
of
any
other
religion
i
asked
her
laughingly
if
she
expected
to
have
the
fifth
part
of
a
man
for
her
husband
i
expect
i
shall
i
believe
it
is
right
she
replied
my
apostolic
friend
took
me
to
brigham
young
s
house
early
in
the
morning
young
had
gone
to
ogden
to
accompany
some
bishops
whom
he
was
sending
abroad
i
left
my
card
with
his
secretary
and
said
i
would
call
at
four
o
clock
but
before
noon
a
servant
from
president
young
brought
a
message
for
me
to
call
on
him
at
one
o
clock
at
the
hour
designated
i
called
with
my
friends
brigham
young
was
standing
in
front
of
one
of
his
houses
the
bee
hive
in
which
was
his
reception
room
he
received
us
with
a
smile
and
invited
us
to
enter
he
was
very
sociable
asked
us
many
questions
and
promptly
answered
ours
finally
he
said
with
a
chuckle
barnum
what
will
you
give
to
exhibit
me
in
new
york
and
the
eastern
cities
well
president
i
replied
i
ll
give
you
half
the
receipts
which
i
will
guarantee
shall
be
per
year
for
i
consider
you
the
best
show
in
why
did
you
not
secure
me
some
years
ago
when
i
was
of
no
consequence
he
continued
because
you
would
not
have
drawn
at
that
time
i
answered
brigham
smiled
and
said
i
would
like
right
well
to
spend
a
few
hours
with
you
if
you
could
come
when
i
am
i
thanked
him
and
told
him
i
guessed
i
should
enjoy
it
but
visitors
were
crowding
into
his
reception
room
and
we
withdrew
i
subsequently
met
him
in
the
street
driving
his
favorite
pair
of
mules
attached
to
a
nice
carriage
he
raised
his
hat
and
bowed
which
salutation
i
of
course
returned
i
hope
that
brigham
s
declining
years
will
prompt
him
to
receive
a
new
revelation
commanding
a
discontinuance
of
the
wife
plurality
feature
of
the
mormon
religion
arriving
at
sacramento
where
the
train
stopped
for
half
an
hour
i
was
interviewed
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
by
a
newspaper
reporter
on
the
same
evening
in
the
excellent
cosmopolitan
hotel
in
san
francisco
i
was
again
interviewed
by
the
chief
editor
of
a
morning
paper
accompanied
by
his
reporter
by
this
time
i
had
become
accustomed
to
this
business
and
when
the
gentlemen
informed
me
they
wanted
to
interview
me
i
asked
them
to
be
seated
pulled
up
an
extra
chair
on
which
to
rest
my
feet
and
said
go
ahead
gentlemen
i
am
well
they
did
go
ahead
asking
me
every
conceivable
question
on
every
conceivable
subject
i
felt
jolly
and
spread
the
consequence
was
three
columns
of
barnum
interviewed
appeared
next
morning
with
a
to
be
continued
at
the
bottom
and
the
succeeding
morning
appeared
three
columns
more
this
conspicuous
advertisement
prepared
the
way
for
a
lecture
i
gave
in
pratt
s
large
hall
which
was
well
attended
it
took
us
a
week
to
do
san
francisco
with
its
suburbs
including
oakland
woodward
s
celebrated
and
beautiful
gardens
and
seal
when
i
saw
that
small
rocky
island
lying
only
ten
rods
off
covered
with
sea
lions
weighing
from
eight
hundred
to
two
thousand
pounds
the
show
fever
began
to
rise
i
offered
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
have
ten
of
the
large
sea
lions
delivered
to
me
alive
in
new
york
so
that
i
could
fence
in
a
bit
of
the
east
river
near
jones
wood
and
give
such
an
exhibition
to
citizens
and
strangers
in
that
city
i
little
thought
at
that
time
that
i
should
subsequently
expend
half
that
sum
in
procuring
these
marine
monsters
and
transport
them
through
the
country
in
huge
as
a
small
item
in
a
mammoth
travelling
show
the
chinese
quarters
where
were
their
shops
restaurants
and
laundries
their
joss
house
and
the
chinese
theatre
gave
us
a
new
sensation
and
were
quite
sufficient
to
quench
a
lingering
desire
i
had
long
felt
to
visit
china
and
japan
the
chinese
servants
and
laborers
are
diligent
peaceable
clean
and
require
no
watching
when
i
remembered
how
many
thousands
of
dollars
i
had
paid
to
eye
servants
for
not
doing
what
i
had
hired
them
to
do
i
did
not
feel
sorry
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
the
celestials
extending
their
travels
to
the
eastern
states
while
i
was
in
san
francisco
a
german
named
gabriel
kahn
brought
to
me
his
little
son
literally
a
little
one
for
he
is
a
dwarf
more
diminutive
in
stature
than
general
tom
thumb
was
when
i
first
found
him
the
parents
of
this
liliputian
were
anxious
that
i
should
engage
and
exhibit
him
several
showmen
had
made
them
very
liberal
offers
but
they
had
set
their
hearts
on
having
barnum
bring
him
out
and
present
him
to
the
public
of
course
i
felt
the
compliment
but
was
inclined
to
say
no
as
i
had
given
up
the
exhibition
business
and
was
a
man
of
leisure
but
the
marvelous
manikin
was
such
a
handsome
intelligent
little
fellow
speaking
fluently
both
english
and
german
and
withal
was
so
pert
and
so
captivating
that
i
was
induced
to
engage
him
for
a
term
of
years
and
gave
him
the
soubriquet
of
admiral
indeed
he
was
but
a
dot
or
as
the
new
york
put
it
the
small
boy
of
the
period
at
any
rate
in
the
matter
of
growth
at
a
very
early
age
he
came
to
a
full
stop
though
further
in
the
matter
of
punctuation
he
compels
an
exclamation
on
the
part
of
all
who
see
him
and
occasions
numerous
i
dressed
the
little
fellow
in
the
complete
uniform
of
an
admiral
and
invited
the
editors
of
the
san
francisco
journals
and
also
a
number
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
the
parlors
of
the
cosmopolitan
hotel
to
visit
him
all
were
astonished
and
delighted
the
newspapers
stated
as
news
the
facts
and
gave
interesting
details
with
regard
to
barnum
s
discovery
of
this
wonderful
curiosity
who
had
been
living
so
long
undiscovered
under
their
very
noses
it
was
the
old
story
of
charles
stratton
tom
thumb
of
bridgeport
over
again
with
a
new
liliputian
and
a
new
locality
meanwhile
i
told
the
parents
of
the
admiral
that
personally
i
should
not
exhibit
their
son
till
i
returned
to
new
york
but
advised
them
to
give
the
san
franciscans
the
opportunity
to
see
him
during
the
remaining
few
weeks
of
my
stay
in
the
golden
state
my
friend
woodward
of
woodward
s
gardens
engaged
the
admiral
for
three
weeks
duly
advertising
the
curious
discovery
by
barnum
of
this
valuable
nugget
further
stating
that
as
he
would
depart
for
the
east
in
three
weeks
the
only
opportunity
for
the
san
francisco
public
to
see
him
was
then
offered
at
the
gardens
immediately
there
was
an
immense
thousands
of
ladies
and
children
as
well
as
men
daily
thronged
the
gardens
saw
the
little
wonder
and
purchased
his
de
during
the
short
period
he
remained
there
little
dot
as
dots
are
apt
to
do
made
his
mark
pocketed
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
for
himself
besides
drawing
more
than
twice
that
sum
for
woodward
moreover
the
extended
and
enthusiastic
notices
of
the
entire
san
francisco
press
gave
the
admiral
a
prestige
and
start
which
would
favorably
introduce
him
wherever
he
might
show
himself
throughout
the
united
states
thus
originated
the
public
exhibition
of
one
of
the
handsomest
most
accomplished
and
most
diminutive
dwarfs
of
whom
there
is
any
history
and
the
fame
of
the
little
admiral
already
is
rapidly
spreading
all
over
the
world
speaking
of
dwarfs
it
may
be
mentioned
here
that
notwithstanding
my
announced
retirement
from
public
life
i
still
retained
business
connections
with
my
old
friend
the
general
tom
thumb
in
i
joined
that
celebrated
dwarf
in
a
fresh
enterprise
which
proposed
an
exhibition
tour
of
him
and
a
party
of
twelve
with
a
complete
outfit
including
a
pair
of
ponies
and
a
carriage
entirely
around
the
world
this
party
was
made
up
of
general
tom
thumb
and
his
wife
formerly
lavinia
warren
commodore
nutt
and
his
brother
rodnia
miss
minnie
warren
sylvester
bleeker
and
his
wife
and
kellogg
besides
an
advertising
agent
and
musicians
bleeker
was
the
manager
and
kellogg
acted
as
treasurer
in
the
fall
of
this
little
company
went
by
the
union
pacific
railway
to
san
francisco
stopping
on
the
way
to
give
exhibitions
at
omaha
denver
salt
lake
city
and
other
places
on
the
route
with
great
success
in
san
francisco
pratt
s
hall
which
the
company
occupied
was
crowded
day
and
evening
for
several
weeks
every
one
went
to
see
them
the
exhibition
was
profusely
and
posted
in
chinese
as
well
as
in
english
and
crowds
of
celestials
went
to
see
the
smallest
specimens
of
mellicans
known
in
that
region
for
admiral
dot
living
in
san
francisco
had
not
then
been
discovered
by
barnum
after
a
prolonged
and
most
profitable
series
of
exhibitions
in
san
francisco
the
company
visited
several
leading
towns
in
california
and
then
started
for
australia
on
the
way
they
stopped
at
the
sandwich
islands
and
exhibited
in
honolulu
from
there
they
went
to
japan
exhibiting
in
yeddo
yokohama
and
other
principle
places
and
afterwards
at
canton
and
elsewhere
in
china
they
next
made
the
entire
tour
of
australia
drawing
immense
houses
at
sydney
melbourne
and
in
other
towns
but
they
did
not
go
to
new
zealand
they
then
proceeded
to
the
east
indies
giving
exhibitions
in
the
larger
towns
and
cities
receiving
marked
attentions
from
rajahs
and
other
distinguished
personages
afterwards
they
went
by
the
way
of
the
suez
canal
to
egypt
and
gave
their
entertainments
at
cairo
and
thence
to
italy
exhibiting
at
all
available
points
and
arrived
in
great
britain
in
the
summer
of
notwithstanding
the
enormous
expenses
attending
the
transportation
of
this
company
around
the
world
it
was
one
of
the
few
instances
of
profitably
swinging
round
the
the
enterprise
was
a
pecuniary
success
and
of
course
the
opportunity
for
enjoyed
by
the
little
general
and
his
party
was
fully
appreciated
they
travelled
to
see
as
well
as
to
be
seen
fortunately
they
all
preserved
the
best
of
health
and
met
with
no
accident
during
the
extended
tour
my
name
did
not
publicly
appear
in
connection
with
this
enterprise
the
exhibition
was
conducted
under
the
auspices
of
thumb
but
i
had
a
large
finger
in
the
sylvester
bleeker
the
manager
wrote
me
from
dublin
december
a
letter
from
which
i
extract
the
following
if
any
person
will
perform
the
feat
of
travelling
with
such
a
company
miles
miles
by
sea
give
entertainments
in
different
cities
and
towns
in
all
climates
of
the
world
without
losing
a
single
day
or
missing
a
single
performance
through
illness
or
accident
let
him
show
his
vouchers
and
i
will
give
him
the
while
i
am
about
it
i
may
as
well
confess
my
connection
with
another
little
speculation
during
my
three
years
i
hired
the
siamese
twins
the
giantess
anna
swan
and
a
circassian
lady
and
in
connection
with
judge
ingalls
i
sent
them
to
great
britain
where
in
all
the
principal
places
and
for
about
a
year
their
levees
were
continually
crowded
in
all
probability
the
great
success
attending
this
enterprise
was
much
enhanced
if
not
actually
caused
by
extensive
announcements
in
advance
that
the
main
purpose
of
s
visit
to
europe
was
to
consult
the
most
eminent
medical
and
surgical
talent
with
regard
to
the
safety
of
separating
the
twins
eminent
surgeons
in
london
and
in
edinburgh
examined
these
physiological
phenomena
and
generally
coincided
in
the
declaration
that
their
lives
would
be
jeopardized
and
probably
be
forfeited
if
surgery
should
separate
them
of
course
the
reports
of
these
examinations
were
duly
and
officially
made
in
all
the
leading
medical
and
surgical
journals
as
well
as
the
reports
of
lectures
delivered
by
surgeons
who
had
given
their
personal
attention
to
the
case
of
the
twins
and
these
accounts
in
english
and
american
journals
were
also
translated
and
were
widely
circulated
throughout
europe
as
this
establishment
did
not
advertise
in
the
new
york
i
was
not
a
little
amused
to
see
several
columns
of
editorial
matter
in
that
sheet
published
a
few
weeks
before
the
siamese
twins
sailed
for
europe
giving
elaborate
scientific
reasons
why
no
attempt
to
separate
them
should
be
made
i
quite
coincided
with
my
quondam
friend
bennett
in
his
conclusions
as
a
proof
of
which
i
may
state
that
i
purchased
and
mailed
marked
copies
of
his
editorial
to
all
the
leading
newspapers
and
magazines
abroad
in
most
of
which
the
matter
was
republished
thereby
affording
the
best
of
advertising
and
greatly
increasing
the
receipts
of
the
twin
treasury
for
many
months
but
to
return
to
my
california
trip
we
visited
the
geysers
and
when
we
witnessed
the
bold
mountain
scenery
through
which
we
passed
to
get
there
and
then
saw
and
heard
the
puffing
steaming
burning
bubbling
acres
of
hot
springs
emitting
liquids
of
a
dozen
different
minerals
and
of
as
many
different
colors
we
said
this
would
pay
for
coming
all
the
way
from
new
york
if
we
saw
nothing
else
and
it
would
in
returning
from
the
geysers
to
calistoga
we
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
celebrated
stage
driver
foss
he
had
been
laying
for
me
several
days
and
had
said
he
would
give
barnum
a
specimen
of
stage
driving
that
would
astonish
he
did
it
foss
is
by
far
the
greatest
stage
driver
of
modern
times
the
way
he
handles
the
reins
seems
marvellous
and
although
he
dashes
his
team
under
full
gallop
down
the
most
precipitous
mountain
roads
making
one
s
hair
continually
to
stand
on
end
his
horses
are
as
docile
as
lambs
and
they
know
every
tone
of
foss
voice
and
obey
accordingly
i
suppose
that
this
new
hampshire
jehu
is
after
all
as
safe
a
driver
as
ever
held
the
ribbons
calistoga
lies
chiefly
on
made
ground
dig
down
five
feet
and
you
find
water
wherein
an
egg
will
boil
hard
in
five
minutes
a
japanese
tea
plantation
is
started
here
with
prospects
of
success
we
devoted
a
fortnight
to
visiting
the
great
yo
semite
valley
we
went
by
way
of
mariposa
where
we
saw
the
mariposa
grove
of
big
trees
whence
i
sent
to
new
york
a
piece
of
bark
inches
thick
that
bark
was
taken
from
a
tree
feet
in
circumference
over
three
hundred
feet
high
and
according
to
its
annual
layers
years
old
the
yo
semite
has
been
so
often
and
so
well
described
that
i
shall
not
attempt
a
new
description
suffice
it
to
say
it
is
one
of
those
great
and
real
things
in
nature
that
goes
in
reality
far
beyond
any
previous
conception
from
the
moment
i
got
a
bird
s
eye
view
of
this
wonderful
valley
from
inspiration
point
until
a
week
afterwards
when
we
mounted
our
horses
to
emerge
from
it
i
could
not
help
oft
repeating
wonderful
wonderful
sublime
indescribable
incomprehensible
i
never
before
saw
anything
so
truly
and
appallingly
grand
it
pays
me
a
hundred
times
over
for
visiting
on
returning
to
stockton
i
lectured
for
a
methodist
church
pursuant
to
agreement
made
to
that
effect
when
i
left
for
the
yo
semite
twelve
days
before
on
our
return
home
we
stopped
at
cheyenne
and
took
the
branch
railroad
to
denver
colorado
afterwards
going
fifty
miles
by
stage
to
the
mines
at
georgetown
golden
city
central
city
and
other
notable
places
returning
from
denver
we
stopped
at
the
truly
wonderful
town
of
greeley
where
when
we
left
home
in
april
not
ten
persons
resided
but
where
was
now
settled
the
union
this
company
then
numbered
six
hundred
greeley
is
now
a
city
two
years
old
containing
thousands
of
inhabitants
and
increasing
at
a
rate
totally
unexampled
there
is
no
community
of
interests
here
except
in
such
public
works
as
the
irrigating
canals
and
the
each
inhabitant
owns
whatever
lands
and
buildings
he
or
she
pays
for
and
real
estate
and
other
property
rises
in
value
according
to
the
increase
in
the
number
of
inhabitants
here
are
millions
of
acres
of
rich
valley
land
which
needed
only
the
irrigation
that
the
cache
de
poudre
river
is
giving
through
the
canals
of
the
union
colony
this
model
town
of
greeley
will
ever
have
peace
and
prosperity
within
its
borders
for
no
title
can
inhere
to
any
land
or
building
where
intoxicating
drinks
are
permitted
to
be
sold
it
is
a
city
of
refuge
from
the
curse
of
strong
drink
and
to
it
for
generations
to
come
will
whole
families
congregate
as
their
paradise
guarded
by
flaming
swords
of
sobriety
and
order
where
they
can
live
rationally
happily
and
prosperously
from
greeley
we
returned
to
new
york
and
my
family
removed
to
our
summer
quarters
in
bridgeport
the
last
of
june
here
we
were
visited
by
numerous
noble
friends
the
late
alice
cary
spent
several
weeks
with
us
at
waldemere
and
although
her
health
was
feeble
she
enjoyed
the
cool
breezes
as
well
as
the
fine
drives
for
which
bridgeport
is
specially
renowned
indeed
my
own
house
was
the
last
which
this
good
and
gifted
lady
ever
entered
except
her
own
in
new
york
to
which
i
accompanied
her
from
bridgeport
her
sister
phÅbe
who
so
quickly
followed
alice
to
the
other
world
was
also
my
guest
at
waldemere
but
the
restless
spirit
of
an
energetic
man
of
leisure
prompted
me
again
to
travel
i
went
with
friends
to
montreal
quebec
the
saginaw
river
and
the
regions
round
about
returning
by
way
of
saratoga
springs
my
english
friends
again
had
occasion
to
open
their
eyes
at
the
large
union
hotel
and
congress
hall
where
fifteen
hundred
persons
dine
at
one
time
and
two
thousand
lodge
under
a
single
roof
without
crowding
well
this
is
a
big
country
and
you
americans
do
everything
on
a
big
scale
that
s
a
fact
was
the
expression
for
the
thousandth
time
of
my
companions
in
september
i
made
up
a
party
of
ten
including
my
english
friend
and
we
started
for
kansas
on
a
grand
buffalo
hunt
general
custar
commandant
at
fort
hayes
was
apprized
in
advance
of
our
anticipated
visit
and
he
received
us
like
princes
he
fitted
out
a
company
of
fifty
cavalry
furnishing
us
with
horses
arms
and
ammunition
we
were
taken
to
an
immense
herd
of
buffaloes
quietly
browsing
on
the
open
plain
we
charged
on
them
and
during
an
exciting
chase
of
a
couple
of
hours
we
slew
twenty
immense
bull
buffaloes
we
might
have
killed
as
many
more
had
we
not
considered
it
wanton
butchery
my
friend
george
a
wells
of
bridgeport
who
is
a
great
hunter
was
one
of
the
party
and
although
he
had
slain
two
buffaloes
and
had
lost
himself
on
the
prairie
not
only
to
his
own
dismay
but
to
the
great
terror
for
four
mortal
hours
of
all
his
companions
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
he
wanted
to
camp
out
and
hunt
buffaloes
for
several
days
longer
another
bridgeport
huntsman
james
wilson
was
of
the
same
mind
but
when
the
question
was
put
to
vote
my
english
friend
john
fish
who
had
made
himself
sore
by
hard
riding
charles
hotchkiss
a
bridgeport
bank
president
who
was
quite
content
with
killing
one
buffalo
my
right
bower
david
sherwood
who
with
a
single
shot
dropped
an
immense
bull
as
indeed
he
now
and
then
has
done
with
no
other
weapon
than
his
tongue
david
read
a
bridgeport
merchant
another
bridgeporter
theodore
downs
each
credited
with
one
or
two
carcases
on
the
field
and
i
who
had
brought
down
two
and
had
half
killed
another
buffalo
all
voted
that
we
had
done
enough
and
were
in
favor
of
returning
home
whereupon
wells
indignantly
exclaimed
i
was
invited
out
here
for
a
hunt
but
you
have
made
it
a
but
every
man
had
killed
his
buffalo
some
had
killed
two
and
we
were
satisfied
we
had
plenty
of
buffalo
and
antelope
meat
and
on
the
whole
our
ten
days
sport
afforded
another
sensation
a
feeling
so
necessary
to
one
in
my
state
but
sensations
can
not
be
made
to
order
every
day
i
am
therefore
taught
by
an
experience
of
three
years
retirement
from
business
that
it
is
better
to
be
moderately
engaged
in
some
legitimate
occupation
so
long
as
health
and
energy
permit
if
a
man
is
regularly
in
harness
though
he
may
do
but
a
small
portion
of
the
drawing
he
will
at
least
so
far
occupy
his
mind
as
not
to
need
spasmodic
excitements
hence
although
my
worldly
possessions
trivial
indeed
in
comparison
with
the
wealth
of
some
of
america
s
millionaires
were
yet
as
ample
as
i
cared
to
acquire
nevertheless
from
the
very
necessity
of
my
active
nature
in
the
autumn
of
i
began
to
prepare
a
great
show
enterprise
requiring
five
hundred
men
and
horses
to
transport
and
conduct
it
through
the
country
selecting
as
manager
of
this
gigantic
enterprise
william
coup
whom
i
had
favorably
known
for
some
years
as
a
capital
showman
and
a
man
of
good
judgment
integrity
and
excellent
executive
ability
we
spent
several
weeks
in
blocking
out
and
perfecting
our
course
of
action
as
one
project
after
another
involving
the
outlay
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
dollars
was
laid
before
manager
coup
he
began
to
open
his
eyes
pretty
widely
and
before
we
had
been
three
weeks
in
consultation
he
exclaimed
why
barnum
such
a
show
as
you
are
projecting
after
a
while
would
ruin
the
richest
man
in
america
for
the
expenses
would
double
the
receipts
every
day
i
begged
coup
not
to
be
alarmed
reminding
him
that
i
was
not
wholly
inexperienced
in
the
show
business
and
that
in
any
event
i
was
to
foot
the
it
is
true
that
the
enormous
expense
of
this
vast
scheme
involved
a
greater
risk
than
any
showman
had
ever
before
dared
to
assume
my
main
object
in
setting
on
foot
this
great
travelling
exhibition
was
to
open
a
safety
valve
for
my
pent
up
energies
and
i
felt
far
more
anxious
to
put
before
the
public
a
grand
and
triumphant
show
than
i
did
to
add
a
penny
to
my
competence
when
my
plans
were
made
public
the
proprietors
of
the
travelling
shows
throughout
the
country
with
scarcely
an
exception
declared
that
my
exhibition
necessarily
must
prove
a
failure
for
they
said
no
travelling
show
in
the
world
ever
took
in
so
much
money
per
day
as
barnum
s
daily
expenses
will
i
knew
that
this
was
nearly
true
but
in
reply
to
their
prognostications
i
only
said
well
but
you
see
no
show
that
has
travelled
ever
drew
out
of
the
people
i
expect
to
attract
all
of
i
confess
i
felt
that
my
reputation
for
always
giving
my
patrons
more
than
their
money
s
worth
and
also
for
scrupulously
excluding
from
my
exhibitions
everything
objectionable
to
the
refined
and
moral
would
inevitably
draw
out
large
numbers
of
people
who
are
not
in
the
habit
of
attending
ordinary
travelling
shows
with
these
views
i
had
confidence
in
my
undertaking
from
the
start
and
i
expended
money
like
water
in
order
fully
to
carry
out
my
intentions
and
desires
previous
business
arrangements
prevented
my
opening
at
the
first
in
new
york
but
i
did
the
next
best
thing
by
going
to
the
next
best
place
for
the
benefit
and
convenience
of
my
numerous
new
york
friends
and
patrons
and
opened
in
brooklyn
april
at
the
outset
the
exhibition
was
truly
a
mammoth
one
it
embraced
a
museum
menagerie
caravan
and
hippodrome
all
and
unsurpassed
in
previous
shows
and
dan
costello
s
celebrated
circus
was
added
it
was
an
exhibition
absolutely
colossal
exhaustive
and
bewilderingly
various
as
the
most
liberal
expenditure
and
years
of
experience
could
possibly
make
it
my
motto
through
life
has
been
get
the
best
regardless
of
my
aim
was
to
combine
in
the
several
shows
more
startling
and
entirely
novel
wonders
of
creation
than
were
ever
before
seen
in
one
collection
anywhere
in
the
world
and
to
furnish
my
patrons
with
wholesome
instruction
and
innocent
amusement
without
the
taint
of
anything
that
should
seem
immoral
or
exceptionable
in
all
this
i
fully
succeeded
and
i
declare
with
pride
that
this
grand
combination
has
proved
to
be
the
crowning
success
of
my
managerial
life
my
canvas
covered
about
three
acres
of
ground
and
would
hold
nearly
ten
thousand
people
yet
from
the
start
in
brooklyn
and
throughout
the
entire
summer
tour
it
was
of
daily
occurrence
that
from
one
thousand
to
three
thousand
people
were
turned
away
after
an
extraordinarily
successful
week
in
brooklyn
i
visited
all
the
leading
places
in
the
immediate
vicinity
then
the
principal
towns
in
connecticut
next
through
rhode
island
to
boston
how
the
great
combination
was
received
and
appreciated
in
the
athens
of
america
is
well
set
forth
in
the
following
extracts
from
a
article
in
the
boston
the
arrival
in
boston
last
monday
of
barnum
s
new
enterprise
comprising
a
museum
menagerie
caravan
and
hippodrome
to
which
is
gratuitously
added
dan
costello
s
mammoth
circus
has
produced
a
sensation
in
this
city
never
before
equalled
by
any
amusement
enterprise
known
to
new
england
we
have
had
our
anniversaries
reviews
parades
the
odd
fellows
and
shall
have
fisk
s
famous
but
after
all
nothing
seems
to
equal
or
eclipse
the
great
barnum
and
his
immense
amusement
enterprise
which
is
the
theme
of
universal
comment
and
observation
here
as
elsewhere
have
you
seen
barnum
is
the
question
that
is
heard
in
the
streets
counting
houses
stores
and
shops
the
public
being
as
anxious
to
see
the
veteran
show
king
as
they
are
to
visit
his
big
show
we
confess
that
barnum
is
a
curiosity
and
always
has
been
for
the
last
thirty
years
during
which
time
he
has
figured
prominently
before
the
american
people
until
the
fame
of
him
is
as
familiar
to
both
worlds
as
household
words
verily
who
has
not
heard
of
barnum
and
the
famous
american
museum
we
don
t
mean
that
as
a
specimen
of
the
barnum
is
very
different
from
other
specimens
who
have
gained
notoriety
and
success
but
simply
as
an
embodiment
of
the
very
best
representative
type
of
a
shrewd
enterprising
wide
awake
american
who
has
achieved
an
immense
success
in
his
specialty
as
the
greatest
amusement
caterer
of
the
nineteenth
century
through
two
disastrous
conflagrations
his
immense
museum
collection
in
new
york
however
the
accumulations
of
half
a
century
were
in
a
single
day
almost
entirely
swept
out
of
existence
this
was
a
serious
loss
to
the
public
as
it
was
to
barnum
although
he
is
said
to
have
taken
it
as
coolly
and
imperturbably
as
the
apple
woman
round
the
corner
would
the
loss
of
a
roxbury
russet
already
advancing
in
years
and
thinking
no
doubt
he
had
served
the
public
long
enough
barnum
concluded
after
the
loss
of
his
museum
to
retire
permanently
from
the
show
business
and
taking
horace
greeley
s
advice
go
a
fishing
or
seek
the
shades
of
a
more
quiet
and
private
life
for
the
balance
of
his
days
a
man
however
like
barnum
who
has
spent
a
whole
life
amid
scenes
of
bustle
and
excitement
with
a
constant
tension
of
muscle
and
brain
catering
for
the
ever
recurring
demands
of
a
curious
public
naturally
fond
of
amusements
especially
the
marvellous
and
sensational
is
rarely
satisfied
to
withdraw
suddenly
like
the
tortoise
within
his
own
shell
and
let
the
outside
world
wag
without
taking
an
active
interest
in
passing
events
thus
barnum
s
retirement
although
surrounded
by
every
luxury
that
money
could
furnish
became
the
veriest
prison
to
every
element
nervous
physical
and
intellectual
of
his
being
and
it
is
no
wonder
under
these
circumstances
that
he
became
absolutely
restive
under
his
ambition
like
ancient
utica
he
felt
to
be
too
much
pent
up
and
as
volcanoes
bellow
ere
they
disembogue
so
smoke
betrays
the
wild
consuming
like
dan
costello
s
famous
gymnasts
his
vaulting
ambition
has
fairly
o
erleapt
itself
for
by
a
single
bound
he
comes
before
the
public
in
a
new
role
having
on
his
hands
an
elephant
more
ponderous
and
expensive
to
manage
than
the
famous
quadruped
that
used
to
be
seen
plowing
on
his
bridgeport
farm
not
for
agricultural
purposes
exactly
but
as
a
rocket
thrown
up
to
attract
public
attention
to
my
broadway
american
about
a
year
ago
barnum
desirous
to
do
good
in
his
day
and
generation
instituted
and
put
on
wheels
his
present
mammoth
enterprise
at
a
cost
of
nearly
of
a
million
dollars
which
has
met
with
a
success
unparalleled
in
the
annals
of
the
show
business
this
success
is
so
sudden
and
complete
as
to
astonish
everybody
and
none
more
so
than
professionals
themselves
knowing
the
interest
the
public
feels
in
all
that
pertains
to
barnum
and
especially
his
last
great
effort
barnum
himself
calls
it
his
last
great
splurge
which
we
readily
grant
in
deference
to
his
known
modesty
we
sent
one
of
our
reporters
to
interview
the
whole
affair
and
as
his
injunctions
were
imperative
to
stick
to
facts
justitia
ruat
our
readers
will
be
able
to
judge
of
the
big
show
as
it
appeared
one
thing
is
very
evident
since
starting
from
new
york
barnum
s
show
has
been
patronized
by
the
largest
concourse
of
people
ever
known
in
new
england
his
transit
across
the
country
has
been
like
sherman
s
march
to
the
sea
while
his
entertainments
have
been
visited
by
the
great
masses
including
eminent
clergymen
and
their
families
and
the
most
respectable
of
all
persuasions
in
fact
by
everybody
without
reference
to
race
color
or
previous
condition
etc
barnum
s
great
procession
which
made
its
first
appearance
in
the
streets
last
monday
is
one
of
the
grandest
and
most
magnificent
pageants
of
the
kind
that
ever
appeared
in
boston
the
great
cortege
is
varied
and
almost
interminable
in
length
the
cages
chariots
carriages
and
vans
no
two
being
painted
or
finished
alike
are
of
unique
workmanship
elaborate
design
and
gorgeously
painted
and
gilded
the
mottoes
inscribed
on
the
cages
are
peculiarly
curt
and
barnamish
the
massively
carved
chariot
called
the
temple
of
juno
which
in
construction
is
somewhat
telescopic
that
is
lets
up
and
down
to
the
extent
of
thirty
feet
or
more
by
means
of
machinery
is
of
solid
carved
work
gilt
all
over
with
the
precious
metals
and
studded
profusely
with
plated
mirrors
which
give
to
the
tableau
a
truly
gorgeous
and
magnificent
effect
upon
an
elevated
seat
just
beneath
a
rich
and
unique
oriental
canopy
of
the
most
elaborate
finish
sits
in
perfect
nonchalance
the
representative
queen
surrounded
by
gods
and
goddesses
in
mythological
costume
giving
a
striking
picture
of
an
oriental
pageant
as
seen
in
the
days
of
the
roman
emperors
this
gorgeous
car
built
in
london
expressly
for
barnum
is
forty
feet
high
and
is
rendered
picturesque
in
effect
by
the
team
of
elephants
camels
and
dromedaries
which
lead
or
escort
the
van
the
entire
procession
is
the
longest
and
most
varied
ever
witnessed
here
and
consisted
of
about
seventy
cages
wagons
and
chariots
and
horses
but
let
us
follow
this
grand
street
demonstration
to
the
grounds
selected
for
the
great
exposition
for
we
are
a
little
anxious
to
know
what
becomes
of
so
many
horses
wagons
housings
traps
and
paraphernalia
in
general
the
lot
on
which
the
three
colossal
tents
are
pitched
presents
a
really
novel
and
interesting
sight
from
two
to
three
acres
of
land
are
required
for
all
the
purposes
of
exhibition
hotel
caravansary
ecurie
horse
tents
etc
immediately
after
returning
from
the
pageant
the
cages
containing
the
living
wild
animals
and
all
the
museum
curiosities
are
driven
under
the
spacious
tents
and
arranged
in
regular
order
those
containing
the
animals
being
arranged
in
the
caravan
and
menagerie
while
the
others
are
classified
in
the
museum
department
the
horses
are
detached
from
the
cages
dens
and
chariots
by
experienced
grooms
and
immediately
removed
to
eight
long
rows
of
horse
tents
which
are
located
in
a
separate
lot
containing
about
thirty
horses
each
these
being
principally
draft
and
baggage
horses
as
the
ring
stock
is
conveyed
to
hotel
and
livery
stables
of
the
people
connected
with
this
varied
show
were
employed
in
getting
their
breakfast
the
establishment
is
equipped
with
portable
stoves
and
accomplished
cooks
the
meals
are
served
in
large
tents
and
in
this
way
all
the
attaches
but
the
artists
are
fed
everything
connected
with
the
enterprise
is
first
class
a
fact
which
strikes
one
turn
which
way
he
will
not
only
is
everything
done
for
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
the
people
engaged
with
it
but
the
same
thoughtfulness
is
manifested
in
behalf
of
the
horses
whether
used
for
draught
purposes
or
as
accessories
to
the
arenic
performances
the
tents
in
which
the
horses
are
kept
are
large
and
ample
room
is
assigned
each
animal
in
fact
they
are
complete
stables
with
patent
mangers
and
all
the
modern
stable
appointments
the
best
rye
straw
is
used
for
bedding
and
never
were
horses
better
provided
with
the
little
notions
which
certainly
contribute
to
their
comfort
and
which
are
probably
in
exact
accordance
with
a
horse
s
idea
of
good
living
a
veterinary
surgeon
is
regularly
employed
and
the
health
of
the
horses
is
we
have
reason
to
believe
much
closer
looked
after
than
the
health
of
many
people
is
by
their
family
physician
the
wagons
used
for
the
conveyance
of
baggage
when
the
company
is
moving
are
converted
into
sleeping
rooms
at
night
by
letting
down
shelves
which
when
equipped
with
bedding
and
blankets
form
very
comfortable
berths
each
wagon
accommodates
twelve
persons
another
feature
worthy
of
notice
is
the
manner
in
which
the
baggage
is
carried
if
each
person
carried
a
saratoga
of
course
it
would
require
some
fifty
wagons
to
carry
the
trunks
to
obviate
this
difficulty
the
clothing
and
other
personal
effects
of
the
employees
are
kept
in
one
large
wagon
the
possessions
of
each
one
are
numbered
this
wagon
is
in
charge
of
a
clerk
who
has
reduced
his
business
to
a
science
and
with
the
same
skill
that
a
photographer
picks
out
your
old
negative
from
among
a
thousand
others
when
you
order
an
additional
dozen
de
this
gentleman
can
produce
the
article
called
for
at
a
moment
s
notice
having
satisfied
ourselves
that
barnum
s
numerous
employees
know
how
to
groom
their
stock
as
well
as
how
to
keep
a
hotel
we
will
now
take
our
readers
with
us
to
the
great
show
the
doors
of
which
are
by
this
time
opened
of
course
they
must
buy
their
own
tickets
for
the
management
are
not
in
the
habit
of
papering
their
house
rather
than
play
to
empty
benches
and
we
shall
see
whether
phineas
has
kept
faith
with
the
public
for
we
have
a
glimmering
recollection
that
he
promised
not
long
ago
to
make
this
last
great
effort
the
crowning
success
of
his
managerial
life
which
we
are
of
course
bound
to
believe
although
we
have
also
a
sort
of
inquisitive
penchant
to
look
for
the
already
the
masses
of
curious
are
occupying
every
foot
of
available
ground
the
three
ticket
wagons
being
literally
besieged
from
which
the
necessary
cards
of
admission
are
being
rapidly
distributed
at
fifty
cents
per
head
for
adults
children
half
price
and
very
soon
the
three
colossal
tents
are
full
to
overflowing
with
anxious
spectators
the
first
impression
that
one
receives
on
entering
is
that
of
bewilderment
such
is
the
magnitude
extent
variety
and
uniqueness
of
the
combination
here
in
almost
endless
variety
we
see
gathered
together
from
all
parts
of
the
earth
a
miniature
representation
of
the
wonder
world
that
nobody
but
barnum
would
ever
have
thought
of
securing
for
a
travelling
exhibition
then
follows
in
the
same
article
a
detailed
account
of
the
leading
attractions
which
want
of
space
precludes
me
from
copying
the
notice
concludes
as
follows
with
all
these
unique
and
bewildering
attractions
our
faith
has
been
wonderfully
increased
and
we
shall
no
longer
doubt
why
it
is
that
barnum
is
the
happiest
and
most
successful
show
proprietor
that
ever
came
before
the
american
public
and
no
man
more
than
he
deserves
as
he
is
constantly
receiving
their
unstinted
and
unprecedented
patronage
the
great
show
is
now
on
its
triumphant
tour
through
northern
new
england
and
will
no
doubt
be
visited
by
myriads
everywhere
as
it
has
been
here
and
elsewhere
from
boston
my
exhibition
went
through
new
hampshire
and
into
maine
as
far
as
waterville
why
the
show
did
not
go
to
towns
beyond
in
the
state
is
fully
and
amusingly
explained
in
the
following
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
august
barnum
s
menagerie
and
circus
one
of
the
greatest
successes
ever
achieved
in
the
annals
of
the
sawdust
ring
has
been
accomplished
the
present
season
by
barnum
s
museum
menagerie
and
circus
from
the
inception
of
the
enterprise
success
has
crowned
its
efforts
barnum
s
name
in
itself
has
been
a
tower
of
strength
and
to
his
direction
and
general
control
its
success
is
due
there
are
few
men
that
have
the
courage
to
invest
nearly
in
so
precarious
a
business
and
to
run
it
at
a
daily
expense
of
nearly
but
barnum
had
faith
that
the
public
would
respond
liberally
to
his
appeal
one
great
secret
of
his
success
has
been
ever
to
give
the
public
a
great
deal
for
their
money
and
to
fix
the
prices
of
admission
at
popular
rates
but
we
doubt
if
he
expected
so
great
a
success
as
has
recently
in
the
state
of
maine
been
showered
upon
him
it
is
worthy
of
being
recorded
as
equal
to
jenny
lind
s
triumphal
american
tour
it
had
originally
been
the
intention
to
make
a
tour
with
the
great
show
as
far
east
as
bangor
and
it
was
so
announced
but
subsequently
they
found
that
there
were
many
bridges
over
which
it
was
impossible
for
the
large
chariots
to
pass
and
that
the
show
would
be
obliged
to
make
stands
at
several
small
towns
en
route
which
could
not
possibly
pay
the
running
expenses
even
if
every
inhabitant
attended
consequently
it
was
decided
that
lewiston
should
be
the
terminus
of
their
eastern
tour
the
following
letter
dated
winthrop
july
from
a
correspondent
will
best
convey
the
idea
of
the
great
interest
and
enthusiasm
there
manifested
by
the
people
the
business
in
maine
has
been
immense
contrary
to
the
predictions
of
showmen
generally
since
entering
the
state
except
at
brunswick
where
it
rained
hard
all
day
they
have
been
compelled
to
show
three
times
daily
to
accommodate
the
vast
crowds
that
flocked
from
every
direction
while
exhibiting
at
gardiner
and
augusta
persons
came
all
the
way
from
bangor
when
they
reached
waterville
a
scene
occurred
which
has
never
been
equaled
in
this
or
any
other
country
the
village
was
crowded
with
people
who
had
come
from
the
surrounding
country
many
of
them
travelling
a
distance
of
miles
and
all
the
morning
crowds
were
pouring
in
from
all
points
of
the
compass
in
carriages
wagons
and
on
foot
near
the
circus
tents
in
an
adjoining
field
were
several
large
tents
pitched
which
had
served
to
shelter
the
people
the
previous
night
who
had
come
long
distances
and
encamped
there
the
authorities
of
the
village
had
taken
the
precaution
to
stop
the
sale
of
all
spiritous
liquors
during
that
day
and
had
caused
barrels
of
water
and
plenty
of
ice
to
be
placed
at
the
street
corners
for
the
free
use
of
all
carts
were
provided
at
the
expense
of
the
village
to
constantly
replenish
the
barrels
the
early
morning
performance
was
commenced
and
it
was
found
that
they
could
not
accommodate
a
tithe
part
of
their
patrons
and
ere
its
close
an
excursion
train
of
cars
crowded
in
every
part
came
in
from
bangor
closely
followed
by
another
of
seventeen
cars
from
belfast
seeing
this
vast
accession
to
the
already
large
numbers
of
visitors
the
manager
was
somewhat
puzzled
how
to
accommodate
them
finally
it
was
decided
to
give
a
continuous
exhibition
giving
an
act
in
the
circus
department
every
few
moments
this
style
of
performance
was
kept
up
without
cessation
until
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
when
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
falling
afforded
the
manager
an
excuse
to
close
the
exhibitions
the
men
and
horses
were
completely
exhausted
and
their
next
drive
being
miles
to
lewiston
where
they
were
to
exhibit
three
times
they
shipped
all
the
ring
horses
by
railroad
to
give
them
an
opportunity
for
much
needed
rest
on
driving
out
of
augusta
on
july
they
narrowly
escaped
an
accident
similar
to
the
one
which
happened
in
new
jersey
one
of
the
passenger
wagons
with
twelve
passengers
and
having
four
horses
attached
had
driven
down
a
steep
hill
when
suddenly
they
came
upon
a
locomotive
crossing
the
road
immediately
in
front
of
them
the
driver
with
great
presence
of
mind
suddenly
pulled
the
horses
to
the
right
making
an
abrupt
turn
which
overturned
the
wagon
breaking
the
arm
of
summerfield
one
of
the
business
men
bruising
several
others
and
injuring
somewhat
severely
josephe
the
french
giant
who
was
compelled
to
remain
behind
the
show
for
a
couple
of
from
maine
we
went
across
vermont
exhibiting
in
the
more
important
places
to
albany
and
troy
at
albany
it
was
impossible
to
secure
a
suitable
locality
for
the
exhibition
short
of
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
the
city
yet
here
distance
seemed
literally
to
lend
enchantment
to
the
view
for
every
exhibition
was
thronged
and
here
as
everywhere
thousands
were
turned
away
who
were
unable
to
find
room
our
route
from
albany
was
along
the
line
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
to
buffalo
and
back
by
the
erie
railway
to
the
hudson
river
exhibiting
nearly
everywhere
and
after
exhibitions
at
catskill
poughkeepsie
and
newburg
returning
to
new
york
our
tour
through
the
country
was
more
than
a
carnival
it
was
a
perfect
ovation
and
best
of
all
the
public
and
the
press
with
one
accord
pronounced
the
exhibition
even
better
and
greater
than
i
had
advertised
at
the
close
of
the
travelling
season
i
desired
to
exhibit
my
great
show
to
my
new
york
patrons
and
to
return
again
to
the
metropolis
where
in
days
gone
by
the
children
the
parents
and
the
grandparents
of
the
present
generation
have
flocked
in
millions
to
my
museum
accordingly
i
secured
the
empire
rink
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
american
institute
fair
and
opened
in
that
building
november
at
least
ten
thousand
people
were
present
and
in
response
to
an
enthusiastic
welcoming
call
i
made
a
few
remarks
the
report
of
which
i
copy
from
the
next
morning
s
new
york
a
popular
eastern
poet
has
said
the
noblest
art
a
human
being
can
acquire
is
the
power
of
giving
happiness
to
others
i
sincerely
hope
this
is
true
for
my
highest
ambition
during
the
last
thirty
years
has
been
to
make
the
public
happy
when
i
introduced
the
swedish
nightingale
jenny
lind
to
the
american
public
in
a
thrill
of
pleasure
was
felt
throughout
the
land
by
our
most
refined
and
intellectual
citizens
as
well
as
by
every
lover
of
melody
in
the
humblest
walks
of
life
as
a
museum
proprietor
for
nearly
thirty
years
i
catered
successfully
to
the
pleasures
of
many
millions
of
persons
nor
have
my
efforts
been
confined
to
this
continent
as
a
public
exhibitor
i
have
appeared
before
kings
queens
and
emperors
in
the
old
world
and
have
given
gratification
to
many
millions
of
their
devoted
subjects
fifty
years
ago
some
moralists
taught
that
it
was
wicked
to
laugh
but
all
divines
of
the
present
day
have
abandoned
that
untenable
and
austere
position
and
now
almost
universally
agree
that
laughter
is
not
only
conducive
to
health
but
very
proper
and
to
be
encouraged
for
as
the
bard
of
avon
justly
says
with
mirth
and
laughter
let
old
wrinkles
in
fact
beecher
permits
laughing
in
his
church
holding
that
it
is
as
right
to
laugh
as
to
cry
it
has
been
said
that
i
have
caused
more
people
to
laugh
than
any
other
man
on
this
continent
ten
years
ago
one
of
our
first
families
in
fifth
avenue
were
conversing
regarding
the
duties
responsibilities
and
trials
of
this
life
their
little
daughter
of
seven
was
present
the
father
remarked
that
it
was
a
pretty
hard
world
to
live
in
full
of
struggles
labors
toils
and
disappointments
the
mother
added
that
there
was
much
poverty
and
suffering
in
the
world
but
the
little
girl
chirped
in
well
i
think
it
is
a
beautiful
and
pleasant
world
i
have
my
dear
mamma
and
papa
and
my
good
grandma
there
besides
i
have
barnum
s
museum
to
go
to
and
surely
i
don
t
want
a
happier
world
than
my
great
object
has
been
to
elevate
the
standard
of
amusements
to
render
them
instructive
as
well
as
amusing
to
divest
them
of
all
vulgar
and
immoral
tendencies
and
to
make
all
my
exhibitions
worthy
the
patronage
of
the
best
and
most
respectable
families
finally
my
great
desire
has
been
to
give
my
patrons
ten
times
the
worth
of
their
money
and
in
this
my
last
crowning
effort
to
overshadow
and
totally
eclipse
all
other
exhibitions
in
the
and
the
metropolitan
press
people
and
patronage
combined
only
repeated
with
more
emphasis
the
universal
testimony
of
the
country
as
to
the
extent
and
merits
of
this
great
show
want
of
space
permits
me
to
copy
only
two
or
three
of
the
favorable
articles
which
appeared
from
day
to
day
during
the
entire
exhibition
in
the
columns
of
the
new
york
press
the
following
is
from
the
baptist
rare
curiosities
barnum
has
organized
at
the
empire
rink
a
very
large
exhibition
combining
a
museum
menagarie
international
zoÃ¶logical
garden
polytechnic
institute
and
hippodrome
having
examined
the
various
departments
of
this
vast
combination
we
do
not
hesitate
to
recommend
our
friends
to
go
with
their
families
to
visit
it
and
they
will
enjoy
a
treat
seldom
offered
in
a
lifetime
the
department
of
natural
history
is
especially
excellent
and
interesting
and
embraces
the
largest
and
rarest
collection
of
wild
animals
ever
exhibited
together
in
this
or
probably
in
any
other
country
everything
connected
with
the
entertainments
admirably
harmonizes
with
the
good
taste
and
respectability
which
give
to
all
of
barnum
s
enterprises
a
refinement
and
morality
which
commend
them
to
the
most
scrupulous
the
great
hippodrome
pageant
in
which
appear
so
many
elephants
camels
dromedaries
horses
and
ponies
with
men
women
and
children
in
costumes
representing
the
arabs
and
bedouins
of
the
desert
roman
knights
heralds
warriors
kings
princes
and
bashaws
of
the
olden
time
is
truly
interesting
and
grand
and
is
worth
going
a
long
distance
to
see
that
popular
religious
journal
the
new
york
edited
by
the
rev
emerson
speaks
as
follows
a
good
sermon
for
showmen
the
success
which
everywhere
attends
barnum
s
great
show
ought
to
be
evidence
to
the
managers
who
furnish
amusement
to
the
public
that
profanity
and
indecency
of
speech
and
gesture
all
of
which
barnum
excludes
by
promptly
and
indignantly
discharging
the
offender
are
not
of
the
nature
of
supply
meeting
a
popular
demand
if
a
man
is
coarse
and
vulgar
himself
he
usually
has
manhood
enough
left
not
to
take
his
wife
and
children
where
coarseness
and
vulgarity
are
sure
to
be
witnessed
barnum
s
combination
is
now
doing
for
canvas
what
his
jenny
lind
enterprise
did
for
public
halls
its
patrons
are
not
individuals
but
communities
for
example
the
factories
of
paterson
were
compelled
to
suspend
the
operative
population
having
left
for
the
show
but
this
swimming
and
unsurpassed
success
would
come
to
a
full
stop
in
one
day
if
profanity
and
indecency
instead
of
being
rigorously
forbidden
were
encouraged
the
community
at
large
respects
decency
the
show
bewildering
various
and
mammoth
beyond
a
precedent
is
now
on
its
way
through
new
england
in
one
sense
like
sherman
s
march
to
the
sea
and
a
patronage
never
before
anticipated
is
organized
in
advance
it
is
big
and
better
still
it
is
clean
clean
to
the
eye
and
to
the
moral
sense
nym
crinkle
the
dramatic
critic
of
the
new
york
wrote
a
very
entertaining
column
about
the
show
for
that
journal
and
trinculo
copied
it
in
full
in
the
amusements
gossip
of
the
new
york
the
following
is
extracted
from
the
article
barnum
s
universal
show
barnum
who
long
ago
beat
all
creation
is
now
exhibiting
his
spoils
at
the
rink
animated
nature
and
animated
art
make
a
stunning
combination
especially
when
the
combination
is
all
in
active
operation
as
it
generally
is
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
then
one
can
enjoy
the
howls
of
the
animals
the
rush
and
scurry
of
the
arena
the
rattlebang
of
the
band
and
the
delight
of
ten
thousand
people
without
stopping
to
discriminate
it
is
something
for
the
veteran
showman
to
say
he
has
been
able
to
stir
the
metropolis
with
his
caravan
as
other
and
less
indifferent
villages
are
stirred
by
smaller
shows
the
combination
as
shows
are
rated
is
really
an
extraordinary
one
and
when
it
arrives
at
an
average
western
city
it
doubles
the
population
for
them
contributing
of
its
own
multitudinous
teamsters
tricksters
and
about
three
hundred
people
with
as
many
more
ravening
beasts
thrown
in
the
first
living
curiosity
that
one
meets
at
the
rink
is
barnum
himself
uncaged
he
still
holds
to
the
notion
that
it
is
worth
fifty
cents
to
look
at
him
and
one
dollar
to
read
his
life
and
as
nearly
everybody
has
looked
at
him
and
read
his
life
we
presume
the
rest
of
the
world
agrees
with
him
still
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
the
healthy
and
hearty
world
thronging
to
see
the
monkeys
and
the
mermaids
mingle
awe
with
their
admiration
of
the
greatest
curiosity
of
all
they
are
subdued
by
a
sense
of
the
showman
s
power
they
skirt
carefully
round
the
edges
of
his
greatness
so
as
not
to
attract
too
much
of
his
attention
for
who
could
tell
at
what
moment
if
he
so
chose
he
would
exhibit
them
we
say
the
healthy
and
hearty
world
for
of
course
the
unhealthy
and
deformed
world
which
we
all
know
was
made
to
be
exhibited
throngs
as
of
old
in
supplicating
procession
after
him
women
and
men
and
children
may
be
seen
at
all
hours
congregating
on
the
third
avenue
in
the
vicinity
of
the
rink
seeking
audience
of
the
great
showman
indeed
the
observant
traveller
on
this
great
thoroughfare
will
know
hours
before
he
gets
to
the
rink
that
he
is
approaching
barnum
by
the
strange
monstrosities
woolly
horses
albino
children
and
living
skeletons
that
will
be
observed
wending
their
way
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
the
great
show
in
hope
of
getting
engagements
of
course
all
this
adds
to
the
excitement
and
interest
of
the
eager
multitude
but
the
animals
and
curiosities
inside
constitute
the
real
attraction
to
the
public
and
a
very
fine
collection
of
animals
it
is
the
eight
or
ten
royal
abyssinian
and
babylonian
lions
roar
less
like
sucking
doves
than
any
that
have
had
their
jaws
stretched
among
us
since
van
amburgh
s
time
as
for
the
rhinoceros
he
deserves
especial
attention
because
as
the
card
on
his
cage
informs
us
he
is
the
unicorn
of
scripture
but
he
doesn
t
look
a
bit
like
the
agile
fellow
that
fought
for
the
crown
on
his
hind
legs
ah
he
was
an
artist
for
he
eats
too
much
hay
and
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
and
contrary
to
the
revolutionary
character
of
the
unicorn
dear
to
heraldry
than
this
monster
eating
hay
with
the
demureness
of
a
cow
still
there
is
danger
in
his
cage
the
keeper
informs
us
and
he
ought
to
know
for
he
probably
lived
there
at
some
time
with
him
in
order
to
find
him
out
and
he
further
assures
us
that
the
reason
barnum
employs
him
to
take
care
of
the
beast
is
that
he
is
an
old
sailor
nobody
else
being
able
to
go
round
his
horn
time
however
would
not
suffice
to
relate
the
wonders
of
the
yak
and
guayga
and
the
wart
hog
none
of
which
are
popular
pets
nor
to
tell
of
the
infinite
variety
of
the
feline
tribe
from
himself
to
the
tiniest
cougar
this
collection
of
animals
makes
what
is
called
the
zoÃ¶logical
garden
a
distinct
apartment
of
the
show
there
is
a
collection
of
camels
about
forty
and
several
elephants
eating
peanuts
with
singularly
disproportioned
taste
at
the
east
end
and
here
we
observe
is
the
menagerie
the
camels
each
with
his
hump
tastefully
covered
with
a
camel
s
hair
shawl
wait
with
meek
patience
for
the
to
call
them
and
they
all
slide
out
on
their
cushioned
feet
like
dusty
spectres
it
would
be
well
to
visit
the
collection
of
wild
animals
after
this
and
then
inspect
the
exhibition
of
animated
nature
reserving
the
caravan
till
the
last
but
the
conscientious
visitor
has
the
hippodrome
the
hippotheatron
the
circus
the
arena
and
the
ring
to
inspect
and
unless
he
hurries
up
he
will
not
get
through
in
time
we
have
found
it
in
our
experience
that
the
best
plan
is
to
cut
the
arena
the
hippodrome
and
the
hippotheatron
and
stick
to
the
circus
the
circus
will
be
found
worthy
of
the
carefulest
study
it
will
be
found
to
have
a
largeness
that
is
new
and
certainly
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
more
performers
or
have
them
do
more
the
rink
thanks
to
barnum
is
a
popular
resort
we
forget
how
many
miles
of
promenade
there
are
through
the
zoÃ¶logical
department
of
the
menagerie
but
we
know
that
thousands
of
people
may
be
seen
there
of
a
pleasant
afternoon
adding
a
biological
interest
to
the
zoÃ¶logical
exhibit
that
is
well
worth
noting
the
following
is
from
the
new
york
of
unbounded
enterprise
barnum
is
the
only
man
in
the
who
thoroughly
comprehends
the
demands
of
the
public
and
is
willing
to
satisfy
them
at
any
expenditure
of
time
and
means
his
projects
are
conceived
on
a
gigantic
scale
very
far
in
advance
of
the
conservatism
so
characteristic
of
even
liberal
managers
his
expensive
expeditions
to
labrador
some
years
ago
to
capture
white
whales
for
the
american
museum
and
another
expedition
to
south
africa
in
which
secured
the
first
and
only
living
hippopotamus
ever
seen
on
this
continent
involved
an
outlay
sufficient
to
organize
and
completely
furnish
a
show
a
third
even
more
hazardous
expedition
was
sent
to
the
north
pacific
to
capture
seals
sea
lions
and
other
marine
monsters
which
were
transported
thousands
of
miles
in
immense
water
tanks
these
are
but
a
few
in
many
instances
of
that
large
and
comprehensive
liberality
that
distinguishes
all
of
barnum
s
enterprises
and
is
the
source
of
his
managerial
triumphs
and
the
foundation
of
his
financial
success
obstacles
that
to
others
seem
insurmountable
only
spur
him
on
to
greater
effort
no
article
of
real
novelty
or
merit
which
will
enhance
the
attractions
of
his
exhibitions
is
suffered
to
escape
for
lack
of
energy
or
for
want
of
liberal
expenditure
of
money
it
is
this
spirit
that
has
enabled
barnum
to
combine
in
one
exhibition
the
most
complete
and
colossal
collection
of
animate
and
inanimate
curiosities
ever
assembled
in
the
world
in
the
spring
of
when
the
great
show
was
about
to
enter
upon
its
first
campaign
complete
as
it
seemed
to
the
manager
and
to
other
experts
barnum
thought
a
most
valuable
feature
might
be
added
he
telegraphed
to
the
whaling
ports
of
new
england
and
sent
messages
to
san
francisco
and
alaska
to
know
if
a
group
of
sea
lions
and
other
specimens
of
the
phocine
tribe
could
be
secured
finally
through
his
agents
in
san
francisco
he
organized
an
expedition
to
alaska
by
the
first
of
july
several
fine
specimens
of
seals
and
sea
lions
some
of
the
latter
weighing
more
than
pounds
each
were
brought
in
tanks
over
the
union
pacific
railway
were
safely
landed
at
bridgeport
and
thereafter
were
forwarded
to
the
show
then
on
its
travels
through
new
england
as
these
delicate
animals
are
likely
to
die
arrangements
have
been
made
to
keep
good
the
supply
and
december
barnum
received
a
telegram
from
san
francisco
that
six
more
sea
lions
had
just
arrived
at
that
port
for
him
two
of
these
will
be
sent
by
arrangement
to
the
zoÃ¶logical
gardens
in
regent
s
park
london
and
the
rest
with
several
seals
captured
in
the
same
expedition
will
be
added
to
barnum
s
show
next
spring
barnum
s
active
and
enterprising
agents
are
in
europe
asia
africa
south
america
and
elsewhere
in
the
world
wherever
anything
rare
and
valuable
bird
beast
reptile
or
other
animate
or
inanimate
curiosity
can
be
secured
which
will
add
to
the
interest
of
the
exhibition
in
the
menagerie
and
the
hippodrome
also
experts
are
constantly
engaged
in
training
elephants
camels
performing
horses
and
other
animals
and
are
thus
preparing
new
and
attractive
features
some
of
which
will
be
as
novel
to
the
show
profession
as
they
will
be
new
and
attractive
to
the
public
i
might
fill
hundreds
of
pages
with
the
notices
of
the
new
york
papers
during
the
protracted
exhibition
at
the
empire
rink
every
day
almost
the
journals
had
something
new
to
say
about
the
show
from
the
simple
fact
that
nearly
every
day
the
addition
of
some
new
animal
or
attraction
or
fresh
features
in
the
ring
performances
compelled
new
notices
the
exhibition
continued
with
unabated
success
and
patronage
till
after
the
holidays
when
necessary
preparations
for
the
spring
campaign
including
the
repainting
of
all
the
wagons
compelled
me
to
close
i
must
make
mention
merely
of
two
genuine
curiosities
from
california
the
one
a
section
of
one
of
the
big
trees
and
the
other
a
bright
young
digger
indian
who
was
my
guide
through
the
yosemite
valley
i
little
thought
when
i
saw
the
big
trees
that
i
should
soon
secure
for
exhibition
in
new
york
a
gigantic
section
of
one
of
them
with
the
bark
which
set
up
as
it
enclosed
the
tree
enclosed
on
one
occasion
at
the
empire
rink
two
hundred
children
from
the
howard
mission
the
digger
was
equally
a
curiosity
in
his
way
one
day
when
the
baboon
escaped
from
his
cage
and
defied
all
the
efforts
of
the
keepers
to
capture
him
my
digger
indian
lassooed
him
and
brought
him
down
with
a
run
and
a
rope
in
less
than
no
time
his
services
in
and
with
this
line
on
other
occasions
were
more
memorable
i
can
not
close
this
additional
narrative
without
warning
my
readers
and
the
public
generally
that
the
enormous
success
of
my
great
combination
has
stimulated
unscrupulous
smaller
showmen
to
feeble
imitations
which
in
some
instances
are
and
are
intended
to
be
downright
frauds
upon
the
public
nearly
every
circus
and
menagerie
in
the
country
has
lately
added
what
is
called
a
museum
and
in
some
cases
they
have
employed
a
man
named
or
supposed
to
be
named
barnum
intending
to
advertise
under
the
title
of
barnum
s
show
thereby
deceiving
and
swindling
the
public
the
trick
is
very
transparent
and
can
be
successful
if
at
all
only
in
very
rural
regions
where
the
newspapers
fail
to
penetrate
the
museums
may
embrace
a
stuffed
animal
or
two
and
a
small
show
of
indeed
some
of
these
minor
managers
have
bought
curiosities
from
me
and
cheap
rubbish
from
old
museums
with
which
to
set
up
the
new
features
in
their
circuses
or
menageries
the
whole
public
knows
that
there
is
but
one
barnum
and
but
one
show
in
the
country
of
sufficient
importance
to
bear
his
name
i
trust
to
my
name
and
my
and
reputation
to
insure
the
public
against
imposition
from
the
attempts
of
my
imitators
who
are
as
unprincipled
as
they
will
be
unsuccessful
in
their
efforts
to
defraud
me
and
to
delude
the
public
conclusion
in
sending
these
last
pages
to
the
printer
in
march
i
may
say
that
my
manager
coup
his
assistants
and
myself
have
been
busy
ever
since
new
year
s
in
reorganizing
our
great
travelling
show
building
new
wagons
and
cages
and
painting
gilding
and
repairing
the
others
one
of
the
great
carved
mirrored
and
gilded
chariots
from
england
used
by
me
in
is
a
grand
affair
made
telescopic
and
when
extended
to
its
full
height
reaches
an
altitude
of
forty
feet
on
the
top
of
which
in
our
street
processions
we
place
a
young
lady
costumed
to
personate
the
goddess
of
liberty
the
of
this
one
vehicle
preparatory
to
opening
our
spring
campaign
cost
about
five
thousand
dollars
enough
to
build
a
nice
house
in
the
country
the
wintering
of
my
horses
and
wild
animals
salaries
of
employees
and
expense
of
fitting
up
properly
for
the
next
season
cost
over
during
the
winter
my
agents
abroad
have
shipped
me
many
interesting
and
expensive
curiosities
indeed
ship
after
ship
has
brought
me
so
many
rare
animals
and
works
of
art
that
i
have
sometimes
been
puzzled
to
find
places
to
store
them
two
beautiful
giraffes
or
camelopards
were
despatched
to
me
but
one
died
on
the
atlantic
making
three
of
these
tender
and
valuable
animals
that
i
have
lost
within
a
year
the
only
one
on
this
continent
at
this
present
writing
is
mine
he
is
a
beauty
i
own
another
which
is
now
in
the
royal
zoÃ¶logical
gardens
regent
s
park
london
ready
to
be
shipped
at
any
moment
should
i
unfortunately
be
obliged
to
send
a
message
by
the
atlantic
cable
announcing
the
death
of
my
present
pet
illustration
other
managers
gave
up
trying
to
import
giraffes
several
years
ago
owing
to
the
great
cost
and
care
attending
them
no
giraffe
has
ever
lived
two
years
in
america
these
very
impediments
however
incited
me
to
always
have
a
living
giraffe
on
hand
at
whatever
cost
for
of
course
their
scarcity
enhances
their
attraction
and
value
as
curiosities
i
hear
that
my
example
has
stimulated
the
manager
of
a
small
show
to
try
and
obtain
a
giraffe
i
am
educating
the
public
curiosity
and
taste
to
demand
so
much
that
is
rare
and
valuable
that
many
managers
will
soon
give
up
the
show
business
as
several
have
this
spring
while
others
must
be
more
liberal
and
enterprising
if
they
succeed
hitherto
many
small
showmen
who
could
raise
cash
and
credit
to
the
amount
of
would
get
half
a
dozen
cages
of
cheap
animals
two
or
three
circus
riders
a
few
acrobats
or
tumblers
a
clown
and
three
or
four
broken
down
ring
horses
then
buying
some
ready
printed
dashy
their
show
they
would
announce
a
great
menagerie
and
circus
and
perhaps
clear
the
cost
of
their
show
the
first
season
for
there
are
some
persons
who
are
bound
to
go
to
the
show
whatever
may
be
its
merits
but
the
public
are
generally
getting
sick
of
this
same
old
story
and
as
my
broadway
american
museum
years
ago
served
to
reform
or
extinguish
one
horse
shows
so
i
trust
that
the
immensity
of
my
travelling
show
will
serve
to
elevate
and
extend
public
expectations
and
improve
public
exhibitions
illustration
several
immense
sea
lions
and
barking
seals
have
also
been
captured
by
my
agents
at
alaska
and
are
added
to
the
innumerable
some
of
these
marine
monsters
weigh
a
thousand
pounds
each
and
each
consumes
from
sixty
to
a
hundred
pounds
of
fish
per
day
it
is
very
curious
to
see
them
floundering
in
and
out
of
the
immense
water
tanks
in
which
i
transport
them
through
the
country
their
tremendous
roar
may
often
be
heard
the
distance
of
a
mile
among
my
equestrian
novelties
is
an
italian
goat
taught
in
europe
to
ride
on
horseback
leap
through
hoops
and
over
banners
alighting
on
his
feet
on
the
back
of
the
horse
while
at
full
speed
i
named
him
alexis
in
honor
of
the
russian
prince
he
appeared
at
niblo
s
garden
new
york
in
february
and
created
much
enthusiasm
numerous
artists
in
different
parts
of
europe
have
been
engaged
all
winter
in
making
for
my
show
extraordinary
musical
and
other
automatons
and
moving
tableaux
so
marvelous
in
their
construction
as
to
seem
enchanted
or
to
be
possessed
of
life
but
perhaps
the
most
rare
and
curious
addition
to
my
great
show
and
certainly
the
most
difficult
to
obtain
is
a
company
of
four
wild
fiji
cannibals
i
have
tried
in
vain
for
years
to
secure
specimens
of
these
at
last
the
opportunity
came
three
of
these
cannibals
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
their
royal
enemy
who
was
about
to
execute
and
perhaps
to
eat
them
the
missionaries
and
my
agent
prevailed
upon
the
king
to
accept
a
large
sum
in
gold
on
condition
of
his
majesty
s
granting
them
a
reprieve
and
leave
of
absence
to
america
for
three
years
my
agent
also
leaving
a
large
sum
with
the
american
consul
to
be
forfeited
if
they
were
not
returned
within
the
time
stipulated
accompanying
them
is
a
cannibal
woman
converted
and
educated
by
the
methodist
missionaries
she
reads
fluently
and
very
pleasantly
from
the
bible
printed
in
the
fijian
language
and
she
already
exerts
a
powerful
moral
influence
over
these
savages
they
take
a
lively
interest
in
hearing
her
read
the
history
of
our
saviour
they
earnestly
declare
their
convictions
that
eating
human
flesh
is
wrong
and
faithfully
promise
never
again
to
attempt
it
they
are
intelligent
and
docile
their
characteristic
war
dances
and
rude
marches
as
well
as
their
representations
of
cannibal
manners
and
customs
are
peculiarly
interesting
and
instructive
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
add
that
the
bonds
for
their
return
will
be
forfeited
they
are
already
learning
to
speak
and
read
our
language
and
i
hope
soon
to
put
them
in
the
way
of
being
converted
to
christianity
even
if
by
so
doing
the
title
of
missionary
be
added
to
the
many
already
given
me
by
the
public
illustration
the
following
happy
hit
is
from
the
pen
of
rev
henry
ward
beecher
as
it
appeared
in
that
excellent
paper
of
which
he
is
editor
the
y
of
should
not
a
paternal
government
set
some
limit
to
the
enterprise
of
brother
barnum
with
reference
at
least
to
the
considerations
of
public
safety
here
upon
our
desk
lies
an
indication
of
his
last
perilous
venture
he
invites
us
and
one
friend
no
conditions
as
to
condition
specified
to
a
private
exhibition
of
living
which
he
has
obtained
from
the
fiji
islands
for
his
travelling
show
we
have
beaten
up
in
this
office
among
the
lean
and
tough
and
those
most
easily
spared
in
an
emergency
for
volunteers
to
visit
the
anthropophagi
and
report
but
never
has
the
retiring
and
disposition
of
our
employees
been
more
signally
displayed
this
establishment
was
not
represented
at
that
exposition
if
barnum
had
remembered
to
specify
the
we
might
have
dropped
in
in
a
friendly
way
at
some
other
period
of
the
i
may
add
that
at
the
above
exhibition
several
editors
brought
their
daughters
these
blooming
young
ladies
refused
to
sit
on
the
front
seat
in
the
fear
of
being
eaten
but
i
remarked
that
there
was
more
danger
of
some
of
the
young
gentlemen
swallowing
them
alive
than
there
was
from
the
cannibals
the
belles
subsided
and
were
safe
and
now
comes
a
joke
so
huge
and
ludicrous
that
i
laugh
over
it
daily
although
there
is
a
serious
aspect
to
it
every
shipment
of
curiosities
that
has
arrived
from
abroad
this
winter
has
served
to
put
my
worthy
manager
coup
in
great
agony
i
tell
you
barnum
you
are
getting
this
show
too
big
has
been
repeated
by
my
perplexed
manager
a
hundred
times
since
new
year
s
never
mind
i
reply
we
ought
to
have
a
show
the
public
expect
it
and
will
appreciate
so
here
must
go
six
thousand
dollars
more
for
a
giraffe
wagon
and
the
horses
to
draw
it
says
coup
and
this
makes
more
than
seventy
additional
horses
that
your
importations
since
last
fall
have
rendered
well
friend
coup
we
have
the
giraffe
in
america
i
replied
yes
sir
that
is
all
very
well
but
no
country
can
support
such
an
expensive
show
as
you
are
putting
on
the
and
that
is
poor
coup
s
doleful
complaint
continually
but
now
comes
a
more
serious
side
and
here
is
where
the
joke
comes
in
i
had
wintered
about
five
hundred
horses
and
was
preparing
to
add
at
least
another
hundred
to
my
retinue
i
induced
my
hurd
to
sell
out
his
business
take
stock
in
the
show
and
become
its
treasurer
and
assistant
manager
hurd
is
but
he
moves
cautiously
and
looks
before
he
on
a
cold
clear
morning
in
february
coup
hurd
and
several
of
our
leading
assistants
and
counsellors
called
at
my
house
their
countenances
were
solemn
not
to
say
lugubrious
their
jaws
seemed
firmly
set
and
altogether
i
discovered
something
ominous
in
their
appearance
i
saw
that
there
was
solid
business
ahead
but
i
said
with
a
smile
gentlemen
i
am
right
glad
to
see
you
i
confess
you
don
t
look
very
jolly
but
never
mind
unbosom
yourselves
and
tell
me
what
is
manager
coup
opened
the
ball
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
barnum
said
that
honest
manager
that
our
business
here
is
important
and
serious
although
we
of
course
like
to
bow
to
your
decisions
and
are
ready
to
acknowledge
that
your
experience
is
greater
than
ours
we
have
had
a
long
and
serious
consultation
this
morning
and
have
unanimously
concluded
that
your
show
is
more
than
twice
too
large
to
succeed
that
you
will
lose
nearly
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
if
you
try
to
drag
it
all
through
the
country
and
that
your
only
chance
of
success
is
to
sell
off
more
than
half
of
your
curiosities
and
horses
and
wagons
or
else
divide
them
into
three
or
certainly
two
distinct
is
this
a
gentlemen
i
asked
with
a
feeling
and
countenance
far
from
solemn
by
no
means
a
mutiny
father
said
hurd
but
really
it
is
a
very
serious
affair
we
have
been
making
a
careful
and
close
here
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
figures
and
read
from
it
the
expenses
of
your
exhibitions
including
nearly
a
thousand
men
and
horses
the
printing
board
salaries
will
average
more
than
per
day
but
call
it
you
show
thirty
weeks
days
thus
your
expenses
for
the
tenting
season
besides
wear
and
tear
and
general
depreciation
will
be
at
least
this
is
about
twice
as
much
as
any
show
ever
took
in
one
season
except
your
own
last
year
this
is
the
year
of
the
presidential
election
which
on
account
of
political
excitement
and
mass
meetings
always
injures
travelling
shows
we
have
carefully
looked
over
the
towns
which
you
will
be
able
to
touch
this
summer
not
going
west
of
ohio
for
you
can
not
get
beyond
that
state
in
a
single
season
and
we
compute
your
receipts
at
not
over
which
would
leave
you
a
loser
of
are
you
not
a
little
mistaken
in
some
of
your
estimates
i
asked
mr
barnum
figures
never
lie
exclaimed
coup
with
great
earnestness
and
pulling
a
from
his
breast
pocket
he
opened
it
and
i
saw
that
he
was
set
down
for
the
next
spokesman
our
teams
can
not
travel
with
heavy
loads
more
than
an
average
of
twenty
miles
per
day
continued
coup
now
please
follow
the
lines
marked
on
this
map
and
you
will
find
that
we
are
compelled
to
make
stands
where
there
are
not
people
enough
within
five
miles
to
give
us
an
average
of
per
day
that
will
involve
a
loss
of
and
i
tell
you
that
taking
accidents
storms
and
other
risks
the
season
will
be
ruinous
if
you
don
t
reduce
the
show
more
than
coup
i
replied
did
not
thousands
of
people
come
fifty
sixty
a
hundred
miles
last
year
by
railroad
excursions
to
see
my
show
he
confessed
that
they
did
well
i
replied
if
you
have
lost
faith
in
the
discernment
of
the
public
i
have
not
and
i
propose
to
prove
then
laughing
heartily
i
added
gentlemen
i
thank
you
for
your
advice
but
i
won
t
reduce
the
show
a
single
hair
or
feather
on
the
contrary
i
will
add
five
or
six
hundred
dollars
per
day
to
my
expenses
my
assembled
cabinet
rolled
their
eyes
in
astonishment
father
are
you
crazy
asked
hurd
with
a
look
of
despair
not
much
i
replied
now
i
continued
i
see
the
show
is
too
big
to
drag
from
village
to
village
by
horse
power
and
i
have
long
suspected
it
would
be
and
have
laid
my
plans
accordingly
i
will
immediately
telegraph
to
all
the
principal
railroad
centres
between
here
and
omaha
nebraska
and
within
five
days
i
will
tell
you
what
it
will
cost
to
transport
my
whole
show
taking
leaps
of
a
hundred
miles
or
more
in
a
single
night
when
necessary
so
as
to
hit
towns
every
day
in
the
season
if
i
can
do
this
with
sixty
or
seventy
freight
cars
six
passenger
cars
and
three
engines
within
such
a
figure
as
i
think
it
ought
to
be
done
for
i
will
do
the
cabinet
adjourned
for
five
days
and
it
was
worth
something
to
see
how
astonished
and
apparently
pleased
the
various
members
looked
as
they
withdrew
at
the
appointed
time
all
met
again
the
railroad
telegrams
were
generally
favorable
and
we
then
and
there
resolved
to
transport
the
entire
museum
menagerie
and
hippodrome
all
of
the
coming
season
by
rail
enlisting
a
power
which
if
expended
on
traversing
common
wagon
roads
would
be
equivalent
to
thousand
men
and
if
life
and
health
are
spared
me
till
another
spring
i
will
report
the
result
of
thus
setting
on
foot
a
mighty
army
with
but
if
it
is
wisely
appointed
that
some
other
hand
shall
record
it
i
confidently
trust
that
the
american
public
will
bear
witness
that
i
found
great
pleasure
in
contributing
to
their
rational
enjoyment

readers
of
the
preceding
pages
will
expect
in
this
appendix
a
brief
resumÃ©
of
events
relating
to
my
great
travelling
world
s
fair
for
the
season
of
connected
as
i
have
been
with
so
many
gigantic
undertakings
and
the
subject
of
so
many
and
varied
experiences
it
can
hardly
be
thought
strange
if
i
have
taught
myself
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
in
the
way
of
business
results
the
idea
of
attempting
to
transport
by
rail
any
company
or
combination
requiring
cars
to
be
moved
daily
from
point
to
point
was
an
experiment
of
such
magnitude
that
railroad
companies
could
not
supply
my
demands
and
i
was
compelled
to
purchase
and
own
all
the
cars
up
to
this
time
in
life
my
record
is
clear
for
never
retrograding
after
once
embarking
in
any
undertaking
and
i
did
not
propose
to
establish
a
contrary
precedent
at
this
late
day
so
at
the
appointed
time
the
great
combination
moved
westward
by
rail
the
result
is
known
it
visited
the
states
of
new
jersey
delaware
maryland
pennsylvania
district
of
columbia
virginia
ohio
indiana
kentucky
illinois
missouri
kansas
iowa
minnesota
wisconsin
and
michigan
in
order
to
exhibit
only
in
large
towns
it
was
frequently
necessary
to
travel
one
hundred
miles
in
a
single
night
arriving
in
season
to
give
three
exhibitions
and
the
usual
street
pageant
at
o
clock
by
means
of
cheap
excursion
trains
thousands
of
strangers
attended
daily
from
along
the
lines
of
the
various
railroads
for
a
distance
of
fifty
and
even
a
hundred
miles
other
thousands
came
in
wagons
on
and
by
every
means
of
conveyance
that
could
be
pressed
into
service
until
by
o
clock
the
hour
for
the
morning
exhibition
the
streets
sidewalks
and
stores
were
filled
with
strangers
it
was
universally
conceded
that
the
money
invested
by
these
country
customers
who
took
this
opportunity
to
visit
the
town
and
make
purchases
exceeded
by
many
thousands
of
dollars
the
amount
i
took
away
indeed
my
own
expenditures
at
each
point
where
we
exhibited
averaged
my
gross
receipts
some
idea
of
the
excitement
throughout
the
country
may
be
formed
from
the
fact
that
upon
arriving
at
daylight
we
usually
found
wagon
loads
of
rural
strangers
men
women
and
children
who
had
come
in
during
the
night
and
pitched
they
had
arrived
at
a
most
unseasonable
hour
for
pleasure
but
this
nocturnal
experience
was
no
barrier
when
they
had
the
ultimatum
of
seeing
notwithstanding
our
transportation
was
necessarily
done
at
night
under
all
the
disadvantages
of
darkness
and
usually
by
three
trains
it
is
gratifying
to
look
back
upon
the
great
railroad
campaign
of
as
entirely
free
from
serious
accident
a
few
minor
casualties
occurred
at
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
june
several
of
our
cars
and
cages
were
precipitated
down
an
embankment
at
erie
by
the
gross
carelessness
of
a
switchman
and
the
utter
recklessness
of
two
locomotive
engineers
the
accident
resulted
in
no
loss
of
life
but
the
crushed
cages
the
roaring
of
the
animals
the
general
excitement
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
night
was
one
of
egyptian
darkness
all
combined
to
form
an
incident
of
travel
long
to
be
remembered
it
is
also
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
record
that
nothing
like
riotous
conduct
quarreling
or
disturbing
elements
of
any
nature
have
annoyed
us
during
the
tenting
season
i
attribute
this
to
one
fact
that
my
employees
are
and
of
gentlemanly
behavior
that
they
fully
appreciate
the
wisdom
of
my
forty
years
motto
we
study
to
please
and
consequently
make
every
effort
to
preserve
decorum
and
make
visitors
as
happy
as
possible
during
the
few
hours
they
are
with
us
with
wonderful
unanimity
the
public
and
the
press
acknowledged
that
i
exhibited
much
more
than
i
advertised
and
that
no
combination
of
exhibitions
that
ever
travelled
had
shown
a
tithe
of
the
instructive
and
amusing
novelties
that
i
had
gathered
together
this
universal
commendation
is
to
me
the
most
gratifying
feature
of
the
campaign
for
not
being
compelled
to
do
business
merely
for
the
sake
of
profit
my
highest
enjoyment
is
to
delight
my
patrons
the
entire
six
months
receipts
of
the
great
travelling
world
s
fair
exceeded
one
million
dollars
the
expenses
of
days
were
nearly
per
day
making
about
besides
the
interest
on
a
million
dollars
capital
and
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
whole
establishment
although
these
daily
expenses
were
more
than
double
the
receipts
of
any
other
show
ever
organized
in
any
country
the
financial
result
surprised
every
one
and
even
i
who
had
anticipated
so
much
was
a
little
set
back
when
my
treasurer
made
his
final
report
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
the
year
of
a
heated
presidential
campaign
when
factional
strife
and
political
ambition
might
be
expected
to
monopolize
public
attention
to
the
serious
detriment
of
amusements
generally
i
think
i
may
with
truth
say
that
no
other
man
in
america
would
have
dared
to
assume
such
risk
all
well
known
showmen
agree
that
without
which
is
recognized
as
the
synonym
of
old
reliable
always
giving
my
patrons
thrice
the
worth
of
their
money
the
enormous
outlay
i
incurred
would
have
swamped
any
other
proprietor
of
this
vast
collection
of
novelties
requiring
the
services
of
men
and
horses
the
tenting
season
proper
closed
at
detroit
october
when
we
were
patronized
by
the
largest
concourse
of
people
ever
assembled
in
the
state
of
michigan
during
this
season
of
unparalleled
prosperity
i
made
it
my
custom
to
be
present
at
all
large
cities
and
prominent
points
and
superintend
in
person
the
gigantic
combination
frequently
i
was
invited
by
leaders
in
the
temperance
cause
or
by
the
young
men
s
christian
associations
to
lecture
on
temperance
which
invitation
i
accepted
when
in
my
power
but
always
upon
conditions
that
the
lecture
should
be
free
and
open
to
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
that
upon
these
occasions
more
people
were
turned
away
than
gained
admission
but
whether
these
crowds
were
attracted
by
an
interest
in
the
temperance
cause
or
from
a
desire
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
old
showman
i
have
never
been
fully
satisfied
my
manager
and
assistants
insist
that
the
latter
is
true
and
that
my
free
lectures
especially
in
the
large
cities
result
to
my
pecuniary
disadvantage
as
fully
satisfying
many
who
otherwise
would
patronize
the
exhibition
to
gratify
their
curiosity
however
as
our
immense
pavilions
are
always
crowded
i
can
see
no
real
cause
for
complaint
at
my
stage
of
life
i
confess
to
a
deeper
interest
in
the
noble
cause
of
temperance
than
i
ever
had
in
the
largest
audience
ever
assembled
under
canvas
if
but
the
people
who
have
signed
the
pledge
at
these
lectures
keep
it
through
life
i
shall
feel
that
my
labors
in
this
direction
will
not
have
been
devoid
of
valuable
and
beneficent
results
early
in
the
presidential
canvass
i
published
a
general
invitation
offering
the
free
use
of
my
immense
hippodrome
pavilion
to
either
of
the
great
political
parties
for
holding
mass
meetings
no
building
in
the
west
would
accommodate
the
masses
seeking
admission
upon
these
occasions
and
open
air
gatherings
were
at
a
discount
even
with
enthusiastic
politicians
my
immense
circus
canvas
had
a
seating
capacity
of
and
was
proof
against
ordinary
storms
my
offer
gave
the
free
use
of
this
immense
tent
between
the
hours
of
and
the
invitation
was
accepted
in
some
instances
where
the
exhibition
and
the
political
gathering
were
billed
for
the
same
day
when
not
with
the
company
i
spent
most
of
my
time
at
my
ideal
home
waldemere
to
me
who
have
travelled
so
far
and
seen
so
much
and
whose
life
seems
destined
to
be
an
eventful
one
this
delightful
summer
retreat
is
invested
with
new
charms
at
each
successive
visit
the
beautiful
groves
seem
still
more
beautiful
the
foliage
more
green
the
entire
scenery
more
picturesque
and
the
broad
expanse
of
water
with
the
long
island
shore
visible
in
the
mazy
background
sparkles
in
the
sunlight
with
additional
brilliancy
possibly
my
affection
for
waldemere
is
due
in
some
degree
to
the
fact
that
i
can
here
look
upon
thriving
shade
trees
and
spacious
drives
of
my
own
creation
and
that
wherever
art
has
beautified
nature
it
has
but
utilized
plans
and
carried
out
suggestions
of
my
own
in
i
attached
to
waldemere
a
new
building
for
a
library
its
architecture
was
so
beautiful
and
unlike
the
main
edifice
that
after
expending
on
it
i
was
obliged
to
lay
out
on
the
house
to
make
it
correspond
it
was
the
old
story
of
the
man
s
new
sofa
over
again
when
the
building
was
enlarged
the
lawn
on
the
east
side
appeared
too
narrow
so
i
purchased
a
slip
of
land
seven
acres
on
that
side
for
the
land
is
worth
it
for
building
lots
at
present
prices
but
i
could
not
help
half
agreeing
with
a
neighboring
farmer
who
said
well
that
barnum
is
the
queerest
man
i
ever
saw
he
s
gone
and
spent
for
a
little
potato
patch
to
put
on
his
the
past
season
my
summer
home
was
made
still
more
attractive
by
the
frequent
presence
of
distinguished
personal
friends
whom
i
took
delight
in
entertaining
their
sojourn
i
endeavored
to
make
agreeable
and
in
after
years
their
recollections
of
waldemere
will
i
trust
be
pleasing
reminiscences
of
a
quiet
visit
and
unfeigned
hospitality
in
august
i
received
a
visit
from
my
esteemed
friend
the
late
horace
greeley
mine
was
one
of
the
few
private
residences
he
visited
during
the
campaign
and
the
last
i
think
which
he
sought
for
relaxation
or
pleasure
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
spoke
the
true
sentiment
of
his
heart
when
he
assured
me
of
his
enjoyment
while
at
my
house
and
never
did
a
careworn
journalist
and
him
too
the
very
central
figure
of
a
heated
political
campaign
stand
more
in
need
of
repose
and
perfect
freedom
from
mental
excitement
than
did
greeley
at
this
time
i
arranged
an
clam
bake
at
which
were
present
congenial
spirits
from
home
and
abroad
greeley
laid
aside
all
restraint
he
mingled
freely
with
the
guests
and
his
native
genial
humor
and
ready
wit
contributed
greatly
to
the
enjoyment
the
keenest
observer
could
have
detected
nothing
like
care
or
anxiety
upon
his
countenance
and
the
stranger
would
have
pointed
him
out
as
a
quiet
farmer
enjoying
a
day
at
the
although
not
much
of
a
politician
i
have
my
political
preferences
greeley
was
my
personal
friend
i
gave
him
my
support
once
i
ventured
my
opinion
that
his
election
was
doubtful
he
replied
that
a
more
important
result
than
his
election
would
be
that
running
upon
so
liberal
a
platform
as
that
adopted
at
cincinnati
would
compel
all
parties
to
recognize
a
higher
standard
regarding
public
justice
and
the
rights
of
others
my
chief
concern
he
added
is
to
do
nothing
in
this
canvass
that
i
shall
look
back
upon
with
an
unapproving
in
october
i
visited
colorado
accompanied
by
my
english
friend
john
fish
and
a
bridgeport
gentleman
who
has
an
interest
with
me
in
a
ranche
in
the
southern
part
of
that
territory
we
took
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
to
denver
seeing
many
thousands
of
wild
buffalo
our
train
sometimes
being
stopped
to
let
them
pass
the
weather
was
delightful
we
spent
several
days
in
the
new
and
flourishing
town
of
greeley
i
gave
a
temperance
lecture
there
also
at
denver
at
the
latter
city
in
the
course
of
my
remarks
i
told
them
i
never
saw
so
many
disappointed
people
as
at
denver
the
large
audience
looked
surprised
but
were
relieved
when
i
added
half
the
inhabitants
came
invalids
from
the
east
expecting
to
die
and
they
find
they
can
not
do
it
your
charming
climate
will
not
permit
it
and
it
is
a
fact
i
am
charmed
with
colorado
the
scenery
and
delightful
air
and
particularly
would
i
recommend
as
a
place
of
residence
to
those
who
can
afford
it
the
lively
thriving
city
of
denver
to
those
who
have
their
fortunes
yet
to
make
i
say
go
to
we
took
the
narrow
gauge
road
from
denver
to
pueblo
stopping
at
colorado
springs
and
the
garden
of
the
the
novel
scenery
here
amply
paid
us
for
our
visit
from
pueblo
i
proceeded
forty
miles
by
carriage
to
our
cattle
ranche
and
spent
a
couple
of
days
there
very
pleasantly
we
have
several
thousand
head
of
cattle
there
which
thrive
through
the
winter
without
hay
or
fodder
of
any
kind
at
the
close
in
detroit
of
the
great
western
railroad
tour
i
equipped
and
started
south
a
museum
menagerie
and
circus
which
while
it
made
no
perceptible
diminution
in
the
main
body
was
still
the
largest
and
most
complete
travelling
expedition
ever
seen
in
the
southern
states
louisville
was
designated
as
the
rendezvous
and
point
of
consolidation
of
the
various
departments
and
the
new
expedition
gave
its
initial
exhibition
in
the
falls
city
november
much
of
the
menagerie
consisted
of
animals
of
which
i
owned
the
duplicate
and
hence
could
easily
spare
them
without
injuring
the
variety
in
my
zoÃ¶logical
collection
i
was
aware
also
that
many
of
the
rare
specimens
would
thrive
better
in
a
warmer
climate
and
as
the
expense
of
procuring
them
had
been
enormous
i
coupled
my
humanitarian
feelings
with
my
pecuniary
interests
and
sent
them
south
and
now
in
this
routine
of
events
for
i
record
one
important
project
with
mingled
feelings
of
pleasure
and
pain
in
august
i
purchased
of
b
lent
the
building
and
lease
in
fourteenth
street
new
york
known
as
the
hippotheatron
one
purpose
was
to
open
a
museum
menagerie
and
hippodrome
that
would
give
employment
to
two
hundred
of
my
people
who
otherwise
would
be
idle
during
the
winter
another
and
main
object
was
to
take
the
inaugural
steps
toward
the
foundation
of
a
permanent
establishment
where
the
higher
order
of
arenic
entertainments
could
be
witnessed
under
all
the
advantages
of
a
thoroughly
equipped
refined
and
moral
dramatic
entertainment
my
project
combined
not
only
a
circus
but
a
museum
of
the
world
s
wonders
and
a
menagerie
that
should
equal
in
extent
and
variety
the
great
zoÃ¶logical
collection
of
london
i
realized
the
importance
of
an
establishment
in
new
york
where
old
and
young
could
seek
innocent
amusement
and
where
christian
parents
could
take
their
children
and
feel
that
the
exhibition
contributed
not
only
to
their
enjoyment
but
to
their
instruction
the
press
generally
had
kindly
acknowledged
the
success
of
my
efforts
in
bringing
the
modern
arena
up
to
its
proper
standard
among
the
fashionable
amusements
of
the
day
by
divesting
the
ring
of
all
objectionable
features
and
securing
the
highest
talent
of
both
hemispheres
my
circus
had
become
popularized
among
the
better
classes
for
whose
good
opinion
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
cater
at
an
expense
of
i
enlarged
and
remodeled
the
building
so
as
to
admit
my
valuable
collection
of
animals
museum
of
automatons
and
living
curiosities
the
entire
edifice
was
so
thoroughly
built
over
as
to
leave
but
little
to
remind
the
visitor
of
the
original
structure
the
amphitheatre
had
a
seating
capacity
of
it
consisted
of
parquette
and
balcony
each
completely
encircling
the
ring
and
the
former
luxuriously
fitted
up
with
cushioned
and
sofa
seats
the
grand
opening
took
place
monday
evening
november
in
theatrical
parlance
the
house
was
crowded
from
pit
to
the
leading
citizens
of
the
metropolis
were
present
many
of
whom
on
that
occasion
patronized
an
equestrian
entertainment
for
the
first
time
viewed
from
the
center
of
the
ring
the
vast
amphitheatre
presented
a
scene
of
bewildering
beauty
the
dazzling
lights
the
delightful
music
of
the
orchestra
the
gorgeous
surroundings
and
the
brilliant
audience
filling
the
numerous
circles
of
seats
which
rose
one
above
another
to
the
most
remote
outskirts
of
the
building
all
formed
a
picture
so
unlike
anything
ever
before
seen
in
new
york
as
to
bring
out
detailed
and
eulogistic
editorials
from
the
press
of
the
following
morning
being
recognized
among
the
audience
i
was
called
into
the
ring
when
i
briefly
thanked
my
friends
for
their
generous
appreciation
from
this
date
the
establishment
was
open
daily
from
to
with
hippodrome
performances
afternoon
and
evening
on
december
four
weeks
after
the
inauguration
of
the
new
fourteenth
street
building
i
started
for
new
orleans
to
visit
my
southern
show
i
found
the
crescent
city
luxuriating
in
its
usual
winter
rains
and
paddling
through
its
regular
rations
of
mud
and
slush
happy
in
its
very
dreariness
the
contentment
of
the
native
population
of
new
orleans
reaches
the
sublime
the
average
citizen
accepts
rain
and
its
kindred
elements
as
special
attractions
indigenous
to
that
climate
and
unless
the
levee
breaks
and
the
turbulent
mississippi
overflows
the
city
they
see
no
occasion
to
murmur
during
the
brief
intervals
of
sunshine
i
rode
through
the
principal
streets
met
several
old
acquaintances
and
renewed
friendships
formed
many
years
ago
changes
i
found
it
is
true
but
they
are
changes
resulting
from
nature
rather
than
from
human
hands
the
ravages
of
time
and
natural
decay
seem
to
offset
all
the
thrift
of
which
new
orleans
can
boast
no
northerner
no
matter
how
frequent
his
visits
fulfills
his
destiny
until
he
drives
to
the
suburbs
and
plucks
his
fill
of
oranges
upon
the
occasion
of
my
visit
political
dissensions
monopolized
public
attention
what
with
the
continual
skirmishing
between
the
municipal
state
and
general
governments
the
city
was
in
a
most
disagreeable
turmoil
and
one
retired
at
night
quite
uncertain
as
to
what
administration
would
be
in
power
in
the
morning
once
i
had
occasion
to
inquire
for
the
governor
s
address
and
my
companion
innocently
asked
which
one
compared
to
the
civic
and
military
imbroglio
in
new
orleans
in
december
the
political
situation
of
mexico
was
one
of
placid
serenity
it
was
while
quietly
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
at
the
louis
hotel
in
the
crescent
city
on
tuesday
december
that
the
waiter
handed
me
a
telegram
i
had
been
reading
in
the
morning
papers
of
the
flooding
of
my
show
grounds
on
canal
street
and
of
the
change
of
location
my
manager
had
been
forced
to
make
these
annoyances
had
prepared
me
when
i
read
the
despatch
to
fully
appreciate
longfellow
s
words
so
disasters
come
not
it
was
as
follows
new
york
barnum
about
fire
discovered
in
of
circus
building
everything
destroyed
except
elephants
camel
hurd
treasurer
calling
for
pen
ink
and
paper
i
then
and
there
cabled
my
european
agents
to
send
duplicates
of
all
animals
lost
with
positive
instructions
to
have
everything
shipped
in
season
to
reach
new
york
by
the
middle
of
march
they
were
further
directed
to
procure
at
any
cost
specimens
never
seen
in
america
and
through
to
purchase
and
forward
curiosities
animate
and
inanimate
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
cable
dispatches
were
also
sent
to
the
celebrated
inventors
and
manufacturers
of
automatons
in
paris
to
lose
no
time
in
making
and
purchasing
everything
new
and
wonderful
in
the
way
of
mechanical
effects
this
feature
of
my
great
exhibition
had
proved
so
attractive
that
i
determined
at
once
not
only
to
duplicate
it
but
to
enlarge
this
department
to
double
its
original
size
i
then
dispatched
the
following
to
my
new
orleans
hurd
tell
editors
i
have
cabled
european
agents
to
expend
half
million
dollars
for
extra
attractions
will
have
new
and
more
attractive
travelling
show
than
ever
early
in
april
barnum
these
details
attended
to
i
could
see
no
further
occasion
for
delaying
breakfast
and
taking
a
calm
view
of
the
situation
the
total
destruction
of
this
beautiful
building
and
its
valuable
contents
was
an
item
of
news
for
which
i
was
ill
prepared
and
the
extent
of
which
calamity
i
could
scarcely
comprehend
i
could
realize
in
a
measure
a
vast
conflagration
with
its
excitement
and
contingent
incidents
but
i
could
not
think
without
a
shudder
of
the
terrible
sufferings
of
one
hundred
wild
beasts
in
their
frantic
howling
efforts
to
escape
the
flames
for
a
moment
i
was
disposed
to
censure
my
agents
and
employees
for
permitting
such
a
wholesale
destruction
of
these
poor
animals
then
i
remembered
the
reliable
men
i
employed
and
could
not
but
feel
assured
that
everything
in
their
power
had
been
done
the
four
beautiful
giraffes
the
only
ones
in
the
united
states
and
which
alone
cost
were
lost
in
the
general
sacrifice
i
learned
afterwards
that
every
effort
was
made
to
rescue
them
but
the
poor
innocent
pets
were
utterly
paralyzed
with
fear
and
could
not
be
made
to
move
even
after
the
lattice
inclosure
had
been
torn
away
had
they
escaped
the
burning
building
the
terrible
cold
night
would
doubtless
have
killed
them
before
they
could
have
been
sheltered
from
the
weather
no
pecuniary
compensation
could
satisfy
me
for
the
loss
of
these
and
many
other
rare
animals
returning
to
new
york
i
learned
that
my
loss
on
building
and
property
amounted
to
the
neighborhood
of
to
meet
this
i
held
insurance
polices
to
the
amount
of
my
equestrian
company
in
which
i
took
great
pride
and
which
i
had
hoped
to
give
employment
during
the
winter
was
of
course
left
idle
until
the
opening
of
the
summer
season
the
members
lost
their
entire
wardrobe
a
loss
of
which
can
only
be
appreciated
by
professionals
i
was
pleased
to
see
a
disposition
manifested
to
render
them
some
assistance
and
encouraged
it
so
far
as
lay
in
my
power
a
benefit
was
arranged
under
the
auspices
of
the
equestrian
benevolent
association
of
the
united
states
the
order
has
for
its
object
the
relief
of
unfortunate
members
and
as
in
the
present
case
its
broad
mantle
of
charity
includes
worthy
professionals
not
members
of
the
association
the
affair
came
off
at
the
academy
of
music
tuesday
january
afternoon
and
evening
many
stars
in
the
equestrian
dramatic
and
musical
firmament
volunteered
for
the
occasion
and
the
two
entertainments
were
largely
attended
being
called
upon
to
define
my
position
i
stepped
upon
the
stage
and
made
a
few
remarks
which
were
reported
in
the
morning
papers
as
follows
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
have
catered
for
so
many
years
for
the
amusement
of
the
public
that
the
beneficiaries
on
this
occasion
seem
to
have
thought
that
the
showman
himself
ought
to
be
a
part
of
the
show
and
at
their
request
i
come
before
you
i
sincerely
thank
you
in
their
behalf
for
your
patronage
on
this
occasion
how
much
they
need
your
substantial
sympathy
the
ashes
across
the
street
can
tell
you
more
eloquently
than
human
tongue
could
utter
those
ashes
are
the
remnants
of
all
the
worldly
goods
of
some
who
appeal
to
you
for
myself
i
have
been
burned
out
so
often
i
am
like
the
singer
who
was
hissed
on
the
stage
hiss
away
said
he
i
am
used
to
my
pecuniary
loss
is
very
serious
and
occurring
as
it
did
just
before
the
holidays
it
is
all
the
more
disastrous
it
may
perhaps
gratify
my
friends
to
know
however
that
i
am
still
enabled
to
invest
another
half
million
of
dollars
without
disturbing
my
bank
account
the
public
will
have
amusements
and
they
ought
to
be
those
of
an
elevating
and
an
unobjectionable
character
for
many
years
it
has
been
my
pleasure
to
provide
a
class
of
instructive
and
amusing
entertainments
to
which
a
refined
christian
mother
can
take
her
children
with
satisfaction
i
believe
that
no
other
man
in
america
possesses
the
desire
and
facilities
which
i
have
in
this
direction
i
have
therefore
taken
steps
through
all
my
agents
in
europe
and
this
country
which
will
enable
me
to
put
upon
the
road
early
in
april
the
most
gigantic
and
complete
travelling
museum
menagerie
and
hippodrome
ever
organized
it
has
been
asked
whether
i
will
build
up
a
large
museum
and
menagerie
in
new
york
well
i
am
now
nearly
years
of
age
i
can
buy
plenty
of
building
sites
and
get
plenty
of
leased
lots
for
a
new
museum
but
i
can
not
get
a
new
lease
of
life
younger
members
of
my
family
desire
me
to
erect
in
this
city
an
establishment
worthy
of
new
york
and
of
myself
it
will
be
no
small
undertaking
for
if
i
erect
such
an
establishment
it
will
possess
novel
and
costly
features
never
before
attempted
i
have
it
under
consideration
and
within
a
month
shall
determine
whether
or
not
i
shall
make
another
attempt
of
one
thing
however
you
may
be
assured
ladies
and
gentlemen
although
conflagrations
may
for
the
present
disconcert
my
plans
yet
while
i
have
life
and
health
no
fire
can
burn
nor
water
quench
my
ambition
to
gratify
my
patrons
at
whatever
cost
of
money
or
of
effort
i
shall
never
lend
my
name
where
my
labors
and
heart
do
not
go
with
it
and
the
public
shall
never
fail
to
find
at
any
of
my
exhibitions
their
money
s
worth
ten
times
told
the
following
paragraph
from
the
new
york
of
january
will
give
an
inkling
of
what
i
am
about
as
i
send
these
last
pages
to
press
barnum
and
the
automaton
talker
phineas
barnum
the
genial
showman
contributes
a
good
deal
to
our
amusement
and
all
new
yorkers
have
a
kindly
side
for
him
here
is
philadelphia
press
account
of
his
latest
achievement
early
yesterday
morning
faber
received
a
call
at
the
girard
house
from
the
renowned
showman
barnum
who
is
now
on
a
visit
to
philadelphia
in
pursuit
of
wonders
for
his
great
travelling
show
within
two
hours
faber
had
given
notice
to
the
emperor
of
austria
of
his
forfeiture
of
for
not
exhibiting
his
talking
machine
at
the
vienna
exposition
next
summer
and
a
contract
was
signed
by
barnum
agreeing
to
pay
for
the
services
of
and
faber
and
their
wonderful
automaton
talker
during
the
tenting
season
of
no
more
marvelous
exhibition
was
ever
seen
in
a
travelling
tent
it
is
the
most
wonderful
achievement
of
ingenuity
that
this
age
of
new
inventions
has
yet
witnessed
although
it
looks
no
more
like
a
talking
machine
than
an
weaver
s
loom
or
a
modern
sewing
machine
it
converses
plainly
and
distinctly
in
all
languages
giving
every
intonation
of
the
human
voice
to
extraordinary
perfection
barnum
says
that
of
visitors
will
hear
this
wonderful
wooden
conversationalist
during
the
coming
it
is
amusing
to
witness
the
difference
in
men
s
dispositions
i
arrived
in
new
york
from
new
orleans
the
night
before
new
year
s
just
a
week
after
the
fire
i
found
my
manager
coup
and
my
hurd
in
rather
low
spirits
i
laughed
at
them
and
called
them
my
deacons
but
begged
them
not
to
go
into
mourning
it
s
astonishing
how
you
can
laugh
when
you
know
our
museum
building
and
all
of
our
rare
animals
are
burned
up
and
we
can
not
get
more
in
time
for
the
spring
show
drawled
the
lugubrious
coup
in
an
injured
tone
if
the
fire
had
waited
ten
days
till
the
holidays
were
over
we
should
have
been
dollars
better
off
chimed
in
the
hurd
if
the
skies
had
fallen
we
should
have
caught
larks
i
replied
but
as
the
skies
did
not
fall
let
us
be
content
with
what
is
still
left
as
for
you
coup
i
continued
you
talk
about
what
we
do
now
have
i
not
told
you
often
enough
the
word
is
not
in
my
dictionary
but
you
can
t
help
the
fire
can
you
retorted
coup
i
shall
not
try
but
i
can
restore
all
it
has
destroyed
and
much
more
i
replied
and
i
will
do
it
within
three
months
at
that
is
easier
said
than
done
responded
coup
with
a
sigh
surely
father
you
don
t
think
we
can
get
a
new
show
upon
the
road
before
july
do
you
asked
hurd
i
repeat
that
i
see
nothing
to
prevent
our
exhibiting
the
largest
and
best
show
on
this
earth
three
months
from
i
replied
all
that
is
required
are
energy
pluck
courage
and
a
liberal
outlay
of
money
all
our
golden
chariots
and
cages
our
horses
harness
canvas
tents
and
wagons
are
saved
besides
which
we
have
thirty
new
cages
nearly
finished
telegraphs
atlantic
cables
and
our
agents
abroad
can
supply
us
all
the
curiosities
and
animals
we
want
before
the
last
of
march
next
if
we
will
supply
them
with
money
but
my
advisers
thought
i
was
too
sanguine
and
they
said
as
much
coup
even
proposed
to
lie
still
a
year
and
start
our
show
again
in
but
i
replied
that
my
years
were
too
few
and
too
precious
to
be
wasted
in
that
way
and
although
i
would
never
put
a
show
upon
the
road
that
did
not
exceed
in
magnitude
and
merit
that
which
we
had
lost
i
felt
every
confidence
in
accomplishing
this
before
april
if
we
would
all
work
hard
strange
enough
before
we
parted
on
that
evening
of
december
i
received
a
cable
message
from
my
trusty
agent
robert
fillingham
of
london
saying
he
had
purchased
for
me
a
pair
of
giraffes
or
camelopards
and
a
full
supply
of
lions
tigers
and
other
animals
he
added
all
the
governmental
zoÃ¶logical
gardens
here
and
on
the
continent
sympathize
with
you
and
are
ready
to
dispose
of
any
animals
you
wish
the
mechanicians
of
paris
and
geneva
are
at
work
on
automatons
and
other
attractions
for
your
travelling
don
t
that
electricity
beat
the
world
exclaimed
coup
with
great
delight
just
put
a
little
of
it
into
your
blood
i
replied
and
we
will
beat
the
the
spirits
of
my
associates
were
thoroughly
revived
and
at
this
present
writing
on
the
day
of
february
i
have
already
received
more
rare
wild
animals
and
other
curiosities
than
i
ever
had
before
at
one
time
with
promise
of
many
more
within
a
month
and
hurd
and
coup
are
in
high
feather
mr
barnum
said
coup
this
morning
this
new
show
of
ours
got
up
in
so
short
a
time
is
the
of
the
well
my
dear
fellow
i
replied
the
public
like
miracles
keep
performing
them
and
you
are
sure
of
success
you
can
never
do
so
much
for
the
public
but
they
will
do
more
for
you
in
return
give
them
the
best
show
possible
at
whatever
cost
keep
it
free
from
objectionable
features
and
never
fear
your
efforts
will
surely
be
appreciated
and
you
will
receive
a
generous
support
remember
excelsior
is
our
these
are
the
feelings
which
inspire
us
as
we
energetically
prepare
for
our
third
campaign
and
although
i
see
plenty
of
hard
work
ahead
i
also
see
bright
skies
smiling
faces
and
assured
success
finis
in
concluding
this
brief
resumÃ©
of
the
last
year
s
events
i
would
seem
ungrateful
did
i
fail
to
acknowledge
my
heartfelt
thankfulness
to
the
public
and
the
press
for
the
generous
and
unqualified
expressions
of
sympathy
on
account
of
the
great
calamity
of
december
editors
throughout
the
united
states
and
europe
have
written
of
this
conflagration
and
of
those
which
preceded
it
and
have
attributed
to
me
a
degree
of
perseverance
i
fear
beyond
my
deserts
if
the
fiery
ordeal
has
had
any
visible
effect
it
has
been
to
increase
my
desire
to
identify
my
name
with
a
class
of
entertainments
at
once
moral
amusing
and
instructive
colossal
as
was
the
great
travelling
world
s
fair
of
that
of
will
surpass
it
with
full
confidence
in
that
just
discrimination
which
recognizes
and
rewards
true
merit
i
remain
as
ever
