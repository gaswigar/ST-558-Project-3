preface
the
historical
novel
has
ever
maintained
a
high
rank
perhaps
the
highest
among
works
of
fiction
for
the
reason
that
while
it
enchants
the
senses
it
improves
the
mind
conveying
under
a
most
pleasing
form
much
information
which
perhaps
the
reader
would
never
have
sought
for
amid
the
dry
records
of
the
purely
historic
narrative
this
fact
being
conceded
it
needs
but
little
argument
to
prove
that
those
works
are
most
interesting
which
treat
of
the
facts
and
incidents
pertaining
to
our
own
history
and
of
a
date
which
is
yet
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
reader
to
this
class
of
books
belongs
the
volume
which
is
here
submitted
to
the
american
reader
from
the
pen
of
a
writer
who
has
proved
himself
unsurpassed
in
the
field
which
he
has
by
his
various
works
made
peculiarly
his
own
the
brief
but
heroic
struggle
of
the
celebrated
chief
osceola
forms
the
groundwork
of
a
narrative
which
is
equal
if
not
superior
to
any
of
mr
reid
former
productions
and
while
the
reader
patriotism
can
not
fail
to
be
gratified
at
the
result
his
sympathy
is
at
the
same
time
awakened
for
the
manly
struggles
and
untimely
fate
of
the
gallant
spirit
who
fought
so
nobly
for
the
freedom
of
his
red
brethren
and
the
preservation
of
their
cherished
chapter
one
the
flowery
land
linda
florida
fair
land
of
flowers
thus
hailed
thee
the
bold
spanish
adventurer
as
standing
upon
the
prow
of
his
caravel
he
first
caught
sight
of
thy
shores
it
was
upon
the
sunday
of
palms
the
festival
of
the
flowers
and
the
devout
castilian
beheld
in
thee
a
fit
emblem
of
the
day
under
the
influence
of
a
pious
thought
he
gave
thee
its
name
and
well
deservedst
thou
the
proud
appellation
that
was
three
hundred
years
ago
three
full
cycles
have
rolled
past
since
the
hour
of
thy
baptismal
ceremony
but
the
title
becomes
thee
as
ever
thy
floral
bloom
is
as
bright
at
this
hour
as
when
leon
landed
upon
thy
shores
ay
bright
as
when
the
breath
of
god
first
called
thee
into
being
thy
forests
are
still
virgin
and
inviolate
verdant
thy
savannas
thy
groves
as
fragrant
as
ever
those
perfumed
groves
of
aniseed
and
orange
of
myrtle
and
magnolia
still
sparkles
upon
thy
plains
the
cerulean
ixia
still
gleam
in
thy
waters
the
golden
nymphae
above
thy
swamps
yet
tower
the
colossal
cypress
the
gigantic
cedar
the
gum
and
the
still
over
thy
gentle
slopes
of
silvery
sand
wave
pines
mingling
their
acetalous
foliage
with
the
frondage
of
the
palm
strange
anomaly
of
vegetation
the
tree
of
the
north
and
the
tree
of
the
south
the
types
of
the
frigid
and
torrid
in
this
thy
mild
mid
region
standing
side
by
side
and
blending
their
branches
together
linda
florida
who
can
behold
thee
without
peculiar
emotion
without
conviction
that
thou
art
a
favoured
land
gazing
upon
thee
one
ceases
to
wonder
at
the
faith
the
wild
faith
of
the
early
adventurers
that
from
thy
bosom
gushed
forth
the
fountain
of
youth
the
waters
of
eternal
life
no
wonder
the
sweet
fancy
found
favour
and
credence
no
wonder
so
delightful
an
idea
had
its
crowds
of
devotees
thousands
came
from
afar
to
find
rejuvenescence
by
bathing
in
thy
crystal
streams
thousands
sought
it
with
far
more
eagerness
than
the
white
metal
of
mexico
or
the
yellow
gold
of
peru
in
the
search
thousands
grew
older
instead
of
younger
or
perished
in
pursuit
of
the
vain
illusion
but
who
could
wonder
even
at
this
hour
one
can
scarcely
think
it
an
illusion
and
in
that
age
of
romance
it
was
still
easier
of
belief
a
new
world
had
been
discovered
why
not
a
new
theory
of
life
men
looked
upon
a
land
where
the
leaves
never
fell
and
the
flowers
never
faded
the
bloom
was
eternal
eternal
the
music
of
the
birds
there
was
no
winter
no
signs
of
death
or
decay
natural
then
the
fancy
and
easy
the
faith
that
in
such
fair
land
man
too
might
be
immortal
the
delusion
has
long
since
died
away
but
not
the
beauty
that
gave
birth
to
it
thou
florida
art
still
the
same
still
art
thou
emphatically
the
land
of
flowers
thy
groves
are
as
green
thy
skies
as
bright
thy
waters
as
diaphanous
as
ever
there
is
no
change
in
the
loveliness
of
thy
aspect
and
yet
i
observe
a
change
the
scene
is
the
same
but
not
the
characters
where
are
they
of
that
red
race
who
were
born
of
thee
and
nurtured
on
thy
bosom
i
see
them
not
in
thy
fields
i
behold
white
and
black
but
not
red
european
and
african
but
not
indian
not
one
of
that
ancient
people
who
were
once
thine
own
where
are
they
gone
all
gone
no
longer
tread
they
thy
flowery
paths
no
longer
are
thy
crystal
streams
cleft
by
the
keels
of
their
canoes
no
more
upon
thy
spicy
gale
is
borne
the
sound
of
their
voices
the
twang
of
their
bowstrings
is
heard
no
more
amid
the
trees
of
thy
forest
they
have
parted
from
thee
far
and
for
ever
but
not
willing
went
they
away
for
who
could
leave
thee
with
a
willing
heart
no
fair
florida
thy
red
children
were
true
to
thee
and
parted
only
in
sore
unwillingness
long
did
they
cling
to
the
loved
scenes
of
their
youth
long
continued
they
the
conflict
of
despair
that
has
made
them
famous
for
ever
whole
armies
and
many
a
hard
straggle
it
cost
the
to
dispossess
them
and
then
they
went
not
willingly
they
were
torn
from
thy
bosom
like
from
their
dam
and
forced
to
a
far
western
land
sad
their
hearts
and
slow
their
steps
as
they
faced
toward
the
setting
sun
silent
or
weeping
they
moved
onward
in
all
that
band
there
was
not
one
voluntary
exile
no
wonder
they
disliked
to
leave
thee
i
can
well
comprehend
the
poignancy
of
their
grief
i
too
have
enjoyed
the
sweets
of
thy
flowery
land
and
parted
from
thee
with
like
reluctance
i
have
walked
under
the
shadows
of
thy
majestic
forests
and
bathed
my
body
in
thy
limpid
streams
not
with
the
hope
of
rejuvenescence
but
the
certainty
of
health
and
joy
oft
have
i
made
my
couch
under
the
canopy
of
thy
spreading
palms
and
magnolias
or
stretched
myself
along
the
greensward
of
thy
savannas
and
with
eyes
bent
upon
the
blue
ether
of
thy
heavens
have
listened
to
my
heart
repeating
the
words
of
the
eastern
poet
oh
if
there
can
be
an
elysium
on
earth
it
is
this
it
is
this
chapter
two
the
indigo
plantation
my
father
was
an
indigo
planter
his
name
was
randolph
i
bear
his
name
in
full
george
randolph
there
is
indian
blood
in
my
veins
my
father
was
of
the
randolphs
of
roanoke
hence
descended
from
the
princess
pocahontas
he
was
proud
of
his
indian
ancestry
almost
vain
of
it
it
may
sound
paradoxical
especially
to
european
ears
but
it
is
true
that
white
men
in
america
who
have
indian
blood
in
them
are
proud
of
the
taint
even
to
be
a
is
no
badge
of
shame
particularly
where
the
has
been
gifted
with
fortune
not
all
the
volumes
that
have
been
written
bear
such
strong
testimony
to
the
grandeur
of
the
indian
character
as
this
one
fact
we
are
not
ashamed
to
acknowledge
them
as
ancestry
hundreds
of
white
families
lay
claim
to
descent
from
the
virginian
princess
if
their
claims
be
just
then
must
the
fair
pocahontas
have
been
a
blessing
to
her
lord
i
think
my
father
of
the
true
lineage
at
all
events
he
belonged
to
a
proud
family
in
the
old
dominion
and
during
his
early
life
had
been
surrounded
by
sable
slaves
in
hundreds
but
his
rich
patrimonial
lands
became
at
length
profuse
hospitality
ruined
him
and
not
brooking
an
inferior
station
he
gathered
up
the
fragments
of
his
fortune
and
moved
southward
there
to
begin
the
world
anew
i
was
born
before
this
removal
and
am
therefore
a
native
of
virginia
but
my
earliest
impressions
of
a
home
were
formed
upon
the
banks
of
the
beautiful
suwanee
in
florida
that
was
the
scene
of
my
boyhood
life
the
spot
consecrated
to
me
by
the
joys
of
youth
and
the
charms
of
early
love
i
would
paint
the
picture
of
my
boyhood
home
well
do
i
remember
it
so
fair
a
scene
is
not
easily
effaced
from
the
memory
a
handsome
frame
coloured
white
with
green
venetians
over
the
windows
and
a
wide
verandah
extending
all
round
carved
wooden
porticoes
support
the
roof
of
this
verandah
and
a
low
balustrade
with
light
railing
separates
it
from
the
adjoining
grounds
from
the
flower
parterre
in
front
the
orangery
on
the
right
flank
and
a
large
garden
on
the
left
from
the
outer
edge
of
the
parterre
a
smooth
lawn
slopes
gently
to
the
bank
of
the
river
here
expanding
to
the
dimensions
of
a
noble
lake
with
distant
wooded
shores
islets
that
seem
suspended
in
the
air
upon
the
wing
and
in
the
water
upon
the
lawn
behold
tall
tapering
palms
with
pinnatifid
leaves
a
species
of
others
with
broad
fronds
the
of
the
south
behold
magnolias
clumps
of
the
fragrant
illicium
and
radiating
crowns
of
the
all
indigenous
to
the
soil
another
native
presents
itself
to
the
eye
a
huge
extending
its
long
horizontal
boughs
covered
thickly
with
evergreen
coriaceous
leaves
and
broadly
shadowing
the
grass
beneath
under
its
shade
behold
a
beautiful
girl
in
light
summer
robes
her
hair
loosely
coifed
with
a
white
kerchief
from
the
folds
of
which
have
escaped
long
tresses
glittering
with
the
hues
of
gold
that
is
my
sister
virginia
my
only
sister
still
younger
than
myself
her
golden
hair
bespeaks
not
her
indian
descent
but
in
that
she
takes
after
our
mother
she
is
playing
with
her
pets
the
doe
of
the
fallow
deer
and
its
pretty
spotted
fawn
she
is
feeding
them
with
the
pulp
of
the
sweet
orange
of
which
they
are
immoderately
fond
another
favourite
is
by
her
side
led
by
its
tiny
chain
it
is
the
black
with
glossy
coat
and
quivering
tail
its
eccentric
gambols
frighten
the
fawn
causing
the
timid
creature
to
start
over
the
ground
and
press
closer
to
its
mother
and
sometimes
to
my
sister
for
protection
the
scene
has
its
accompaniment
of
music
the
golden
oriole
whose
nest
is
among
the
gives
out
its
liquid
song
the
caged
in
the
verandah
repeats
the
strain
with
variations
the
gay
mimic
echoes
the
red
cardinal
and
the
blue
jay
both
fluttering
among
the
flowers
of
the
magnolia
it
mocks
the
chatter
of
the
green
paroquets
that
are
busy
with
the
berries
of
the
tall
cypresses
down
by
the
water
edge
at
intervals
it
repeats
the
wild
scream
of
the
spanish
curlews
that
wave
their
silver
wings
overhead
or
the
cry
of
the
tantalus
heard
from
the
far
islets
of
the
lake
the
bark
of
the
dog
the
mewing
of
the
cat
the
hinny
of
mules
the
neighing
of
horses
even
the
tones
of
the
human
voice
are
all
imitated
by
this
versatile
and
incomparable
songster
the
rear
of
the
dwelling
presents
a
different
aspect
perhaps
not
so
bright
though
not
less
cheerful
here
is
exhibited
a
scene
of
active
life
a
picture
of
the
industry
of
an
indigo
plantation
a
spacious
enclosure

its
fence

pillars
of

huge
oblong
vats
hewn
from
the
great
trunks
of
the
cypress
they
are
ranged
in
threes
one
above
the
other
and
communicate
by
means
of
spigots
placed
in
their
ends
in
these
the
precious

macerated
and
its
cerulean

extracted
beyond
are
rows
of
pretty
little
cottages
uniform
in
size
and
shape
each
embowered
in
its
grove
of
whose
ripening
fruit
and
white
flowers
fill
the
air
with
perfume
these
are
the
here
and
there
towering
above
their
roofs
in
upright
attitude
or
bending
gently
over
is
the
same
noble
that
ornaments
the
lawn
in

other
houses

within

dwelling
by
a

gallery
with

supported
upon
posts
of

fragrant
red
cedar
beyond
the
enclosure
stretch
wild
fields
backed
by
a
dark
belt
of
cypress
forest
that
shuts
out
the
view
of
the

these
fields
exhibit
the

of
cultivation

and

even
some
who
are
of
pure
african
blood
are
not
black
only
but
with
the
exception
of
the
overseer
and
the
owner
of
the
plantation
all
are

some
are
hideously
ugly
with
thick
lips
low
retreating
foreheads
flat
noses
and

others
are
well
proportioned
and
among
them
are

several
that
are

with
coarse
coloured

and

in
their
attire
some
are
naked

upwards

are

gaily
arrayed
in

toqued
with
madras
kerchiefs
of
brilliant

the

of
some
are
tasteful
and
pretty
the

renders
them
picturesque
both
men
and
women
are
alike
employed
in
the
business
of
the
plantation
the
manufacture
of

cut
down
the
plants
with
and
tie
them
in
bundles
others
carry
the
bundles
in
from
the

to
the

a
few
are
employed
in
throwing
them
into

another
few
are
drawing
off
and
beating
some
shovel
the
sediment
into

others
superintend
the

and
cutting
out
all
have
their
respective
tasks
and
all
seem
alike
cheerful
in
the
performance
of
them
they
laugh
and
chatter
and
sing
they
give
back
jest
for
jest
and
scarcely
a
moment
passes
that
merry
voices
are
not
ringing
upon
the
ear
and
yet
these
are
all
slaves
the
slaves
of
my
father
he
treats
them
well
seldom
is
the
lash
uplifted
hence
the
happy
mood
and
cheerful
aspect
such
pleasant
pictures
are
graven
on
my
memory
sweetly
and
deeply
impressed
they

in

and
physical
and
consequently

sense
of
the
injustice
of
his
degraded
position
explain
this
psychological
difference
as
for
the
pure
negro
he
rarely
enacts
the
unfeeling
savage
in
the
drama
of
human
life
he
is
the
victim
not
the
villain
no
matter
where
lies
the
scene
in
his
own
land
or
elsewhere
he
has
been
used
to
play
the
of
the
sufferer
yet
his
soul
is
still
free
from
resentment
or
ferocity
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
kinder
heart
than
that
which
beats
within
the
bosom
of
the
african
black
yellow
jake
was
wicked
without
provocation
cruelty
was
innate
in
his
disposition
no
doubt
inherited
he
was
a
spanish
mulatto

is

maternally

there
was
another
jacob
upon
the
plantation
hence
the
distinctive
sobriquet
of
yellow
jake
this
other
was
black
jake
and
only
in
age
and
size
was
there
any
similarity
between
the
two
in
disposition
they
differed
even
more
than
in
complexion
if
yellow
jake
had
the
brighter
skin
black
jake
had
the
lighter
heart
their
countenances
exhibited
a
complete
contrast
the
contrast
between
a
sullen
frown
and
a
cheerful
smile
the
white
teeth
of
the
latter
were
ever
set
in
smiles
the
former
smiled
only
when
under
the
influence
of
some
malicious
prompting
black
jake
was
a
virginian
he
was
one
of
those
belonging
to
the
old
plantation
had
moved
along
with
his
master
and
felt
those
ties
of
attachment
which
in
many
cases
exist
strongly
between
master
and
slave
he
regarded
himself
as
one
of
our
family
and
gloried
in
bearing
our
name
like
all
negroes
born
in
the
old
dominion
he
was
proud
of
his
nativity
in
caste
a
vaginny
nigger
takes
precedence
of
all
others
apart
from
his
complexion
black
jake
was
not
his
features
were
as
good
as
those
of
the
mulatto
he
had
neither
the
thick
lips
flat
nose
nor
retreating
forehead
of
his
race
for
these
characteristics
are
not
universal
i
have
known
negroes
of
pure
african
blood
with
features
perfectly
regular
and
such
a
one
was
black
jake
in
form
he
might
have
passed
for
the
ethiopian
apollo
there
was
one
who
thought
him
handsome
handsomer
than
his
yellow
namesake
this
was
the
quadroon
viola
the
belle
of
the
plantation
for
viola
hand
the
two
jakes
had
long
time
been
rival
suitors
both
had
assiduously
courted
her
smiles
somewhat
capricious
they
were
for
viola
was
not
without
coquetry
but
she
had
at
length
exhibited
a
marked
preference
for
the
black
i
need
not
add
that
there
was
jealousy
between
the
negro
and
mulatto
on
the
part
of
the
latter
rank
hatred
of
his
rival
which
viola
preference
had
kindled
into
fierce
resentment
more
than
once
had
the
two
measured
their
strength
and
on
each
occasion
had
the
black
been
victorious
perhaps
to
this
cause
more
than
to
his
personal
appearance
was
he
indebted
for
the
smiles
of
viola
throughout
all
the
world
throughout
all
time
beauty
has
bowed
down
before
courage
and
strength
yellow

was

massa
barouche
the
story
of
the
two
jakes
their
loves
and
their
jealousies
is
but
a
common
affair
in
the
of
i
have
singled
it
out
not
from
any
separate
interest
it
may
possess
but
as
leading
to
a
series
of
events
that
exercised
an
important
influence
on
my
own
subsequent
history
the
first
of
these
events
was
as
follows
yellow
jake
burning
with
jealousy
at
the
success
of
his
rival
had
grown
spiteful
with
viola
meeting
her
by
some
chance
in
the
woods
and
far
from
the
house
he
had
offered
her
a
dire
insult
resentment
had
rendered
him
reckless
the
opportune
arrival
of
my
sister
had
prevented
him
from
using
violence
but
the
intent
could
not
be
overlooked
and
chiefly
through
my
influence
the
mulatto
was
brought
to
punishment
it
was
the
first
time
that
yellow
jake
had
received
chastisement
though
not
the
first
time
he
had
deserved
it
my
father
had
been
indulgent
with
him
too
indulgent
all
said
he
had
often
pardoned
him
when
guilty
of
faults
of
crimes
my
father
was
of
an
easy
temper
and
had
an
exceeding
dislike
to
proceed
to
the
extremity
of
the
lash
but
in
this
case
my
sister
had
urged
with
some
spirit
the
necessity
of
the
punishment
viola
was
her
maid
and
the
wicked
conduct
of
the
mulatto
could
not
be
overlooked
the
castigation
did
not
cure
him
of
his
propensity
to
evil
an
event
occurred
shortly
after
that
proved
he
was
vindictive
my
pretty
fawn
was
found
dead
by
the
shore
of
the
lake
it
could
not
have
died
from
any
natural
cause
for
it
was
seen
alive
and
skipping
over
the
lawn
but
the
hour
before
no
alligator
could
have
done
it
nor
yet
a
wolf
there
was
neither
scratch
nor
tear
upon
it
no
signs
of
blood
it
must
have
been
strangled
it
strangled
as
proved
in
the
sequel
yellow
jake
had
done
it
and
black
jake
had
seen
him
from
the
orange
grove
where
the
latter
chanced
to
be
at
work
he
had
been
witness
of
the
tragic
scene
and
his
testimony
procured
a
second
flogging
for
the
mulatto
a
third
event
followed
close
upon
the
heels
of
this
a
quarrel
between
negro
and
mulatto
that
came
to
blows
it
had
been
sought
by
the
latter
to
revenge
himself
at
once
upon
his
rival
in
love
and
the
witness
of
his
late
crime
the
conflict
did
not
end
in
mere
blows
yellow
jake
with
an
instinct
derived
from
his
spanish
paternity
drew
his
knife
and
inflicted
a
severe
wound
upon
his
unarmed
antagonist
this
time
his
punishment
was
more
severe
i
was
myself
enraged
for
black
jake
was
my
body
guard
and
favourite
though
his
skin
was
black
and
his
intellect
but
little
cultivated
his
cheerful
disposition
rendered
him
a
pleasant
companion
he
was
in
fact
the
chosen
associate
of
my
boyish
days
my
comrade
upon
the
water
and
in
the
woods
justice
required
satisfaction
and
yellow
jake
caught
it
in
earnest
the
punishment
proved
of
no
avail
he
was
incorrigible
the
demon
spirit
was
too
strong
within
him
it
was
part
of
his
nature
chapter
four
the
hommock
just
outside
the
orangery
was
one
of
those
singular
formations
peculiar
i
believe
to
florida
a
circular
basin
like
a
vast
opens
into
the
earth
to
the
depth
of
many
feet
and
having
a
diameter
of
forty
yards
or
more
in
the
bottom
of
this
several
cavities
are
seen
about
the
size
and
of
the
appearance
of
dug
wells
regularly
cylindrical
except
where
their
sides
have
fallen
in
or
the
rocky
partition
between
them
has
given
way
in
which
case
they
resemble
a
vast
honeycomb
with
broken
cells
the
wells
are
sometimes
found
dry
but
more
commonly
there
is
water
in
the
bottom
and
often
filling
the
great
tank
itself
such
natural
reservoirs
although
occurring
in
the
midst
of
level
plains
are
always
partially
surrounded
by
eminences
knolls
and
detached
masses
of
testaceous
rocks
all
of
which
are
covered
by
an
evergreen
thicket
of
native
trees
as
red
bay
mulberry
and
several
species
of
palmettoes
sometimes
these
shadowy
coverts
are
found
among
the
trees
of
the
and
sometimes
they
appear
in
the
midst
of
green
savannas
like
islets
in
the
ocean
they
constitute
the
hommocks
of
florida
famed
in
the
story
of
its
indian
wars
one
of
these
then
was
situated
just
outside
the
orangery
with
groups
of
testaceous
rocks
forming
a
around
its
edge
and
draped
with
the
dark
foliage
of
evergreen
trees
of
the
species
already
mentioned
the
water
contained
in
the
basin
was
sweet
and
limpid
and
far
down
in
its
crystal
depths
might
be
seen
gold
and
red
fish
with
yellow
bream
spotted
bass
and
many
other
beautiful
varieties
of
the
finny
tribe
disporting
themselves
all
day
long
the
tank
was
in
reality
a
natural
fishpond
and
moreover
it
was
used
as
the
family
for
under
the
hot
sun
of
florida
the
bath
is
a
necessity
as
well
as
a
luxury
from
the
house
it
was
approached
by
a
sanded
walk
that
led
across
the
orangery
and
some
large
enabled
the
bather
to
descend
conveniently
into
the
water
of
course
only
the
white
members
of
the
family
were
allowed
the
freedom
of
this
charming
sanctuary
outside
the
hommock
extended
the
fields
under
cultivation
until
bounded
in
the
distance
by
tall
forests
of
cypress
and
white
cedar
a
sort
of
impenetrable
morass
that
covered
the
country
for
miles
beyond
on
one
side
of
the
was
a
wide
plain
covered
with
grassy
turf
and
without
enclosure
of
any
kind
this
was
the
a
natural
meadow
where
the
horses
and
cattle
of
the
plantation
were
freely
pastured
deer
often
appeared
upon
this
plain
and
flocks
of
the
wild
turkey
i
was
just
of
that
age
to
be
enamoured
of
the
chase
like
most
youth
of
the
southern
states
who
have
little
else
to
do
hunting
was
my
chief
occupation
and
i
was
passionately
fond
of
it
my
father
had
procured
for
me
a
brace
of
splendid
greyhounds
and
it
was
a
favourite
pastime
with
me
to
conceal
myself
in
the
hommock
wait
for
the
deer
and
turkeys
as
they
approached
and
then
course
them
across
the
savanna
in
this
manner
i
made
many
a
capture
of
both
species
of
game
for
the
wild
turkey
can
easily
be
run
down
with
fleet
dogs
the
hour
at
which
i
was
accustomed
to
enjoy
this
amusement
was
early
in
the
morning
before
any
of
the
family
were
astir
that
was
the
best
time
to
find
the
game
upon
the
savanna
one
morning
as
usual
i
repaired
to
my
stand
in
the
covert
i
climbed
upon
a
rock
whose
flat
top
afforded
footing
both
to
myself
and
my
dogs
from
this
elevated
position
i
had
the
whole
plain
under
view
and
could
observe
any
object
that
might
be
moving
upon
it
while
i
was
myself
secure
from
observation
the
broad
leaves
of
the
magnolia
formed
a
bower
around
me
leaving
a
break
in
the
foliage
through
which
i
could
make
my
reconnoissance
on
this
particular
morning
i
had
arrived
before
sunrise
the
horses
were
still
in
their
stables
and
the
cattle
in
the
enclosure
even
by
the
deer
the
savanna
was
untenanted
as
i
could
perceive
at
the
first
glance
over
all
its
wide
extent
not
an
antler
was
to
be
seen
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
on
observing
this
my
mother
expected
a
party
upon
that
day
she
had
expressed
a
wish
to
have
venison
at
dinner
i
had
promised
her
she
should
have
it
and
on
seeing
the
savanna
empty
i
felt
disappointment
i
was
a
little
surprised
too
the
sight
was
unusual
almost
every
morning
there
were
deer
upon
this
wide
pasture
at
one
point
or
another
had
some
early
stalker
been
before
me
probable
enough
perhaps
young
ringgold
from
the
next
plantation
or
maybe
one
of
the
indian
hunters
who
seemed
never
to
sleep
certainly
some
one
had
been
over
the
ground
and
frightened
off
the
game
the
savanna
was
a
free
range
and
all
who
chose
might
hunt
or
pasture
upon
it
it
was
a
tract
of
common
ground
belonging
to
no
one
of
the
plantations
government
land
not
yet
purchased
certainly
ringgold
had
been
there
or
old
hickman
the
who
lived
upon
the
skirt
of
our
plantation
or
it
might
be
an
indian
from
the
other
side
of
the
swamp
with
such
conjectures
did
i
account
for
the
absence
of
the
game
i
felt
chagrin
i
should
not
be
able
to
keep
my
promise
there
would
be
no
venison
for
dinner
a
turkey
i
might
obtain
the
hour
for
chasing
them
had
not
yet
arrived
i
could
hear
them
calling
from
the
tall
their
loud
gobbling
borne
far
and
clear
upon
the
still
air
of
the
morning
i
did
not
care
for
these
the
larder
was
already
stocked
with
them
i
had
killed
a
brace
on
the
preceding
day
i
did
not
want
more
i
wanted
venison
to
procure
it
i
must
needs
try
some
other
mode
than
coursing
i
had
my
rifle
with
me
i
could
try
a
in
the
woods
better
still
i
would
go
in
the
direction
of
old
hickman
cabin
he
might
help
me
in
my
dilemma
perhaps
he
had
been
out
already
if
so
he
would
be
sure
to
bring
home
venison
i
could
procure
a
supply
from
him
and
keep
my
the
sun
was
just
shewing
his
disc
above
the
horizon
his
rays
were
tingeing
the
tops
of
the
distant
cypresses
whose
leaves
shone
with
the
lines
of
gold
i
gave
one
more
glance
over
the
savanna
before
descending
from
my
elevated
position
in
that
glance
i
saw
what
caused
me
to
change
my
resolution
and
remain
upon
the
rock
a
herd
of
deer
was
trooping
out
from
the
edge
of
the
cypress
woods
at
that
corner
where
the
separated
the
savanna
from
the
cultivated
fields
ha
thought
i
they
have
been
poaching
upon
the
young
i
bent
my
eyes
towards
the
point
whence
as
i
supposed
they
had
issued
from
the
fields
i
knew
there
was
a
gap
near
the
corner
with
movable
bars
i
could
see
it
from
where
i
stood
but
i
now
perceived
that
the
bars
were
in
their
places
the
deer
could
not
have
been
in
the
fields
then
it
was
not
likely
they
had
leaped
either
the
bars
or
the
fence
it
was
a
high
with
stakes
and
riders
the
bars
were
as
high
as
the
fence
the
deer
must
have
come
out
of
the
woods
this
observation
was
instantly
followed
by
another
the
animals
were
running
rapidly
as
if
alarmed
by
the
presence
of
some
enemy
a
hunter
is
behind
them
old
hickman
ringgold
who
i
gazed
eagerly
sweeping
my
eyes
along
the
edge
of
the
timber
but
for
a
while
saw
no
one
a
lynx
or
a
bear
may
have
startled
them
if
so
they
will
not
go
far
i
shall
have
a
chance
with
my
greyhounds
yet
perhaps
my
reflections
were
brought
to
a
sudden
termination
on
perceiving
what
had
caused
the
stampede
of
the
deer
it
was
neither
bear
nor
lynx
but
a
human
being
a
man
was
just
emerging
from
out
the
dark
shadow
of
the
cypresses
the
sun
as
yet
only
touched
the
tops
of
the
trees
but
there
was
light
enough
below
to
enable
me
to
make
out
the
figure
of
a
man
still
more
to
recognise
the
individual
it
was
neither
ringgold
nor
hickman
nor
yet
an
indian
the
dress
i
knew
well
the
blue
cottonade
trousers
the
striped
shirt
and
palmetto
hat
the
dress
was
that
worn
by
our
woodman
the
man
was
yellow
jake
chapter
five
yellow
jake
not
without
some
surprise
did
i
make
this
discovery
what
was
the
mulatto
doing
in
the
woods
at
such
an
hour
it
was
not
his
habit
to
be
so
thrifty
on
the
contrary
it
was
difficult
to
rouse
him
to
his
daily
work
he
was
not
a
hunter
had
no
taste
for
it
i
never
saw
him
go
after
game
though
from
being
always
in
the
woods
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
haunts
and
habits
of
every
animal
that
dwelt
there
what
was
he
doing
abroad
on
this
particular
morning
i
remained
on
my
perch
to
watch
him
at
the
same
time
keeping
an
eye
upon
the
deer
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
mulatto
was
not
after
these
for
on
coming
out
of
the
timber
he
turned
along
its
edge
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
in
which
the
deer
had
gone
he
went
straight
towards
the
gap
that
fed
into
the
i
noticed
that
he
moved
slowly
and
in
a
crouching
attitude
i
thought
there
was
some
object
near
his
feet
it
appeared
to
be
a
dog
but
a
very
small
one
perhaps
an
opossum
thought
i
it
was
of
whitish
colour
as
these
creatures
are
but
in
the
distance
i
could
not
distinguish
between
an
opossum
and
a
puppy
i
fancied
however
that
it
was
the
pouched
animal
that
he
had
caught
it
in
the
woods
and
was
leading
it
along
in
a
string
there
was
nothing
remarkable
or
improbable
in
all
this
behaviour
the
mulatto
may
have
discovered
an
the
day
before
and
set
a
trap
for
the
animal
it
may
have
been
caught
in
the
night
and
he
was
now
on
his
way
home
with
it
the
only
point
that
surprised
me
was
that
the
fellow
had
turned
hunter
but
i
explained
this
upon
another
hypothesis
i
remembered
how
fond
the
negroes
are
of
the
flesh
of
the
opossum
and
yellow
jake
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
perhaps
he
had
seen
the
day
before
that
this
one
could
be
easily
obtained
and
had
resolved
upon
having
a
roast
but
why
was
he
not
carrying
it
in
a
proper
manner
he
appeared
to
be
leading
or
dragging
it
rather
for
i
knew
the
creature
would
not
be
led
and
every
now
and
then
i
observed
him
stoop
towards
it
as
if
caressing
it
i
was
puzzled
it
could
not
be
an
opossum
i
watched
the
man
narrowly
till
he
arrived
opposite
the
gap
in
the
fence
i
expected
to
see
him
step
over
the
bars
since
through
the
was
the
nearest
way
to
the
house
certainly
he
entered
the
field
but
to
my
astonishment
instead
of
climbing
over
in
the
usual
manner
i
saw
him
take
out
bar
after
bar
down
to
the
very
lowest
i
observed
moreover
that
he
flung
the
bars
to
one
side
leaving
the
gap
quite
open
he
then
passed
through
and
entering
among
the
corn
in
the
same
crouching
attitude
disappeared
behind
the
broad
blades
of
the
young
for
a
while
i
saw
no
more
of
him
or
the
white
object
that
he
toated
along
with
him
in
such
a
singular
fashion
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
deer
they
had
got
over
their
alarm
and
had
halted
near
the
middle
of
the
savanna
where
they
were
now
quietly
browsing
but
i
could
not
help
pondering
upon
the
eccentric
manoeuvres
i
had
just
been
witness
of
and
once
more
i
bent
my
eyes
toward
the
place
where
i
had
last
seen
the
mulatto
he
was
still
among
the
i
could
see
nothing
of
him
but
at
that
moment
my
eyes
rested
upon
an
object
that
filled
me
with
fresh
surprise
just
at
the
point
where
yellow
jake
had
emerged
from
the
woods
something
else
appeared
in
motion
also
coming
out
into
the
open
savanna
it
was
a
dark
object
and
from
its
prostrate
attitude
resembled
a
man
crawling
forward
upon
his
hands
and
dragging
his
limbs
after
him
for
a
moment
or
two
i
believed
it
to
be
a
man
not
a
white
man
but
a
negro
or
an
indian
the
tactics
were
indian
but
we
were
at
peace
with
these
people
and
why
should
one
of
them
be
thus
trailing
the
mulatto
i
say
trailing
for
the
attitude
and
motions
of
whatever
creature
i
saw
plainly
indicated
that
it
was
following
upon
the
track
which
yellow
jake
had
just
passed
over
was
it
black
jake
who
was
after
him
this
idea
came
suddenly
into
my
mind
i
remembered
the
that
existed
between
them
i
remembered
the
conflict
in
which
yellow
jake
had
used
his
knife
true
he
had
been
punished
but
not
by
black
jake
himself
was
the
latter
now
seeking
to
revenge
himself
in
person
this
might
have
appeared
the
easiest
explanation
of
the
scene
that
was
mystifying
me
had
it
not
been
for
the
improbability
of
the
black
acting
in
such
a
manner
i
could
not
think
that
the
noble
fellow
would
seek
any
mean
mode
of
retaliation
however
revengeful
he
might
feel
against
one
who
had
so
basely
attacked
him
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
his
character
no
it
could
not
be
he
who
was
crawling
out
of
the
bushes
nor
he
nor
any
one
at
that
moment
the
golden
sun
flashed
over
the
savanna
his
beams
glanced
along
the
greensward
lighting
the
trees
to
their
bases
the
dark
form
emerged
from
out
of
the
shadow
and
turned
head
towards
the
the
long
prostrate
body
glittered
under
the
sun
with
a
sheen
like
scaled
armour
it
was
easily
recognised
it
was
not
negro
not
indian
not
human
it
was
the
hideous
form
of
an
alligator
chapter
six
the
alligator
to
one
brought
up
born
i
might
almost
say
upon
the
banks
of
a
floridian
river
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
the
sight
of
an
alligator
nothing
very
terrible
either
for
ugly
as
is
the
great
saurian
certainly
the
most
repulsive
form
in
the
animal
kingdom
it
is
least
dreaded
by
those
who
know
it
best
for
all
that
it
is
seldom
approached
without
some
feeling
of
fear
the
stranger
to
its
haunts
and
habits
abhors
and
flees
from
it
and
even
the
native
be
he
red
white
or
black
whose
home
borders
the
swamp
and
the
lagoon
approaches
this
gigantic
lizard
with
caution
some
closet
naturalists
have
asserted
that
the
alligator
will
not
attack
man
and
yet
they
admit
that
it
will
destroy
horses
and
horned
cattle
a
like
allegation
is
made
of
the
jaguar
and
vampire
bat
strange
assertions
in
the
teeth
of
a
thousand
testimonies
to
the
contrary
it
is
true
the
alligator
does
not
always
attack
man
when
an
opportunity
offers
nor
does
the
lion
nor
yet
the
tiger
but
even
the
false
buffon
would
scarcely
be
bold
enough
to
declare
that
the
alligator
is
innocuous
if
a
list
could
be
furnished
of
human
beings
who
have
fallen
victims
to
the
voracity
of
this
creature
since
the
days
of
columbus
it
would
be
found
to
be
something
enormous
quite
equal
to
the
havoc
made
in
the
same
period
of
time
by
the
indian
tiger
or
the
african
lion
humboldt
during
his
short
stay
in
south
america
was
well
informed
of
many
instances
and
for
my
part
i
know
of
more
than
one
case
of
actual
death
and
many
of
lacerated
limbs
received
at
the
jaws
of
the
american
alligator
there
are
many
species
both
of
the
caiman
or
alligator
and
of
the
true
crocodile
in
the
waters
of
tropical
america
they
are
more
or
less
fierce
and
hence
the
difference
of
travellers
tales
in
relation
to
them
even
the
same
species
in
two
different
rivers
is
not
always
of
like
disposition
the
individuals
are
affected
by
outward
circumstances
as
other
animals
are
size
climate
colonisation
all
produce
their
effect
and
what
may
appear
still
more
singular
their
disposition
is
influenced
by
the
character
of
the
race
of
men
that
chances
to
dwell
near
them
on
some
of
the
rivers
whose
banks
are
the
home
of
the
apathetic
indian
the
caimans
are
exceedingly
bold
and
dangerous
to
approach
just
so
were
their
congeners
the
alligators
of
the
north
till
the
stalwart
backwoodsman
with
his
axe
in
one
hand
and
his
rifle
in
the
other
taught
them
to
fear
the
upright
form
a
proof
that
these
crawling
creatures
possess
the
powers
of
reason
even
to
this
hour
in
many
of
the
swamps
and
streams
of
florida
alligators
can
not
be
approached
without
peril
this
is
especially
the
case
daring
the
season
of
the
sexes
and
still
more
where
these
reptiles
are
encountered
remote
from
the
habitations
of
man
in
florida
are
rivers
and
lagoons
where
a
swimmer
would
have
no
more
chance
of
life
than
if
he
had
plunged
into
a
sea
of
sharks
notwithstanding
all
this
use
brings
one
to
look
lightly
even
upon
real
danger
particularly
when
that
danger
is
almost
continuous
and
the
denizen
of
the
and
the
swamp
is
accustomed
to
regard
without
much
emotion
the
menace
of
the
ugly
alligator
to
the
native
of
florida
its
presence
is
no
novelty
and
its
going
or
coming
excites
but
little
interest
except
perhaps
in
the
bosom
of
the
black
man
who
feeds
upon
its
tail
or
the
who
makes
a
living
out
of
its
leather
the
appearance
of
one
on
the
edge
of
the
savanna
would
not
have
caused
me
a
second
thought
had
it
not
been
for
its
peculiar
movements
as
well
as
those
i
had
just
observed
on
the
part
of
the
mulatto
i
could
not
help
fancying
that
there
was
connexion
between
at
all
events
it
appeared
certain
that
the
reptile
was
following
the
man
whether
it
had
him
in
view
or
whether
trailing
him
by
the
scent
i
could
not
tell
the
latter
i
fancied
to
be
the
case
for
the
mulatto
had
entered
under
cover
of
the
before
the
other
appeared
outside
the
timber
and
it
could
hardly
have
seen
him
as
it
turned
towards
the
gap
it
might
but
i
fancied
not
more
like
it
was
trailing
him
by
the
scent
but
whether
the
creature
was
capable
of
doing
so
i
did
not
stay
to
inquire
on
it
crawled
over
the
sward
crossing
the
corner
of
the
meadow
and
directly
upon
the
track
which
the
man
had
taken
at
intervals
it
paused
flattened
its
breast
against
the
earth
and
remained
for
some
seconds
in
this
attitude
as
if
resting
itself
then
it
would
raise
its
body
to
nearly
a
yard
in
height
and
move
forward
with
apparent
eagerness
as
if
in
obedience
to
some
attractive
power
in
advance
of
it
the
alligator
progresses
but
slowly
upon
dry
ground
not
faster
than
a
duck
or
goose
the
water
is
its
true
element
where
it
makes
way
almost
with
the
rapidity
of
a
fish
at
length
it
approached
the
gap
and
after
another
pause
it
drew
its
long
dark
body
within
the
enclosure
i
saw
it
enter
among
the
at
the
exact
point
where
the
mulatto
had
disappeared
of
course
it
was
now
also
hidden
from
my
view
i
no
longer
doubted
that
the
monster
was
following
the
man
and
equally
certain
was
i
that
the
latter
that
he
was
followed
how
could
i
doubt
either
of
these
facts
to
the
former
i
was
an
of
the
latter
i
had
circumstantial
proofs
the
singular
attitudes
and
actions
of
the
mulatto
his
taking
out
the
bars
and
leaving
the
gap
free
his
occasional
glances
backward
which
i
had
observed
as
he
was
crossing
the
open
ground
these
were
my
proofs
that
he
knew
what
was
coming
behind
him
undoubtedly
he
knew
but
my
conviction
upon
these
two
points
in
nowise
helped
to
elucidate
the
mystery
for
a
mystery
it
had
become
beyond
a
doubt
the
reptile
was
drawn
after
by
some
attraction
which
it
appeared
unable
to
resist
its
eagerness
in
advancing
was
evidence
of
this
and
proved
that
the
man
was
exercising
some
influence
over
it
that
lured
it
forward
what
influence
was
he
beguiling
it
by
some
charm
of
obeah
a
superstitious
shudder
came
over
me
as
i
asked
myself
the
question
i
really
had
such
fancies
at
the
moment
brought
up
as
i
had
been
among
africans
dandled
in
the
arms
perhaps
nourished
from
the
bosom
of
many
a
sable
nurse
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
my
young
mind
was
tainted
with
the
superstitions
of
bonny
and
benin
i
knew
there
were
alligators
in
the
cypress
swamp
in
its
more
remote
recesses
some
of
enormous
size
but
how
yellow
jake
had
contrived
to
lure
one
out
and
cause
it
to
follow
him
over
the
dry
cultivated
ground
was
a
puzzle
i
could
not
explain
to
myself
i
could
think
of
no
natural
cause
i
was
therefore
forced
into
the
regions
of
the
weird
and
supernatural
i
stood
for
a
long
while
watching
and
wondering
the
deer
had
passed
out
of
my
mind
they
fed
unnoticed
i
was
too
much
absorbed
in
the
mysterious
movements
of
the
and
his
amphibious
follower
chapter
seven
the
so
long
as
they
remained
in
the
i
saw
nothing
of
either
the
direction
of
my
view
was
slightly
oblique
to
the
rows
of
the
plants
the
corn
was
at
full
growth
and
its
tall
culms
and
broad
lanceolate
leaves
would
have
overtopped
the
head
of
a
man
on
horseback
a
thicket
of
evergreen
trees
would
not
have
been
more
impenetrable
to
the
eye
by
going
a
little
to
the
right
i
should
have
become
aligned
with
the
rows
and
could
have
seen
far
down
the
avenues
between
them
but
this
would
have
carried
me
out
of
the
cover
and
the
mulatto
might
then
have
seen
for
certain
reasons
i
did
not
desire
he
should
and
i
remained
where
i
had
hitherto
been
standing
i
was
satisfied
that
the
man
was
still
making
his
way
up
the
field
and
would
in
due
time
discover
himself
in
the
open
ground
an
indigo
flat
lay
between
the
hommock
and
the
maize
to
approach
the
house
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
pass
through
the
indigo
and
as
the
plants
were
but
a
little
over
two
feet
in
height
i
could
not
fail
to
observe
him
as
he
came
through
i
waited
therefore
with
a
feeling
of
curious
anticipation
my
thoughts
still
wearing
a
tinge
of
the
weird
he
came
on
slowly
very
slowly
but
i
knew
that
he
was
advancing
i
could
trace
his
progress
by
an
occasional
movement
which
i
observed
among
the
leaves
and
tassels
of
the
maize
the
morning
was
still
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
and
consequently
the
motion
must
have
been
caused
by
some
one
passing
among
the
plants
of
course
by
the
mulatto
himself
the
oscillation
observed
farther
off
told
that
the
alligator
was
still
following
again
and
again
i
observed
this
movement
among
the
it
was
evident
the
man
was
not
following
the
direction
of
the
rows
but
crossing
diagonally
through
them
for
what
purpose
i
could
not
guess
any
one
of
the
intervals
would
have
conducted
him
in
a
direct
line
towards
the
house
whither
i
supposed
him
to
be
moving
why
then
should
he
adopt
a
more
difficult
course
by
crossing
them
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
i
discovered
his
object
in
this
zigzag
movement
he
had
now
advanced
almost
to
the
nether
edge
of
the
cornfield
the
indigo
flat
was
of
no
great
breadth
and
he
was
already
so
near
that
i
could
hear
the
rustling
of
the
cornstalks
as
they
switched
against
each
other
another
sound
i
could
now
hear
it
resembled
the
howling
of
a
dog
i
heard
it
again
and
after
an
interval
again
it
was
not
the
voice
of
a
dog
but
rather
the
weak
whimper
of
a
puppy
at
first
i
fancied
that
the
sounds
came
from
the
alligator
for
these
reptiles
make
exactly
such
a
noise
but
only
when
young
the
one
following
the
mulatto
was
the
cries
could
not
proceed
from
it
moreover
the
sounds
came
from
a
point
nearer
me
from
the
place
where
the
man
himself
was
moving
i
now
remembered
the
white
object
i
had
observed
as
the
man
was
crossing
the
corner
of
the
savanna
it
was
not
an
opossum
then
but
a
young
dog
yes
i
heard
the
cry
again
it
was
the
whining
of
a
whelp
nothing
else
if
i
could
have
doubted
the
evidence
of
my
ears
my
eyes
would
soon
have
convinced
me
for
just
then
i
saw
the
man
emerge
from
out
the
maize
with
a
dog
by
his
side
a
small
white
cur
and
apparently
a
young
one
he
was
leading
the
creature
upon
a
string
it
after
him
i
had
now
a
full
view
of
the
individual
and
saw
to
a
certainty
that
he
was
our
woodman
yellow
jake
before
coming
out
from
the
cover
of
the
corn
he
halted
for
a
moment
as
if
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
before
him
he
was
upon
his
feet
and
in
an
erect
attitude
whatever
motive
he
had
for
concealment
he
needed
not
to
crouch
amid
the
tall
plants
of
maize
but
the
indigo
did
not
promise
so
good
a
shelter
and
he
was
evidently
considering
how
to
advance
through
it
without
being
perceived
plainly
he
had
a
motive
for
concealing
himself
his
every
movement
proved
this
but
with
what
object
i
could
not
divine
the
indigo
was
of
the
kind
known
as
the
false
guatemala
there
were
several
species
cultivated
upon
the
plantation
but
this
grew
tallest
and
some
of
the
plants
now
in
their
full
purple
bloom
stood
nearly
three
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
soil
a
man
passing
through
them
in
an
erect
attitude
could
of
coarse
have
been
seen
from
any
part
of
the
field
but
it
was
possible
for
one
to
crouch
down
and
move
between
the
rows
unobserved
this
possibility
seemed
to
occur
to
the
woodman
for
after
a
short
pause
he
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
commenced
crawling
forward
among
the
indigo
there
was
no
fence
for
him
to
cross
the
cultivated
ground
was
all
under
one
enclosure
and
an
open
ridge
alone
formed
the
between
the
two
kinds
of
crop
had
i
been
upon
the
same
level
with
the
field
the
skulker
would
have
been
now
hidden
from
my
sight
but
my
elevated
position
enabled
me
to
command
a
view
of
the
intervals
between
the
rows
and
i
could
note
every
movement
he
was
making
every
now
and
then
he
paused
caught
up
the
cur
and
held
it
for
a
few
seconds
in
his
hands
during
which
the
animal
continued
to
howl
as
if
in
pain
as
he
drew
nearer
and
repeated
this
operation
i
saw
that
he
was
its
fifty
paces
in
his
rear
the
great
lizard
appeared
coming
out
of
the
corn
it
scarcely
made
pause
in
the
open
ground
but
still
following
the
track
entered
among
the
indigo
at
this
moment
a
light
broke
upon
me
i
no
longer
speculated
on
the
power
of
obeah
the
mystery
was
dissolved
the
alligator
was
lured
forward
by
the
cries
of
the
dog
i
might
have
thought
of
the
thing
before
for
i
had
heard
of
it
before
i
had
heard
from
good
authority
the
himself
who
had
often
captured
them
by
such
a
decoy
that
these
reptiles
will
follow
a
howling
dog
for
miles
through
the
forest
and
that
the
old
males
especially
are
addicted
to
this
habit
hickman
belief
was
that
they
mistake
the
voice
of
the
dog
for
that
of
their
own
offspring
which
these
unnatural
parents
eagerly
devour
but
independently
of
this
monstrous
propensity
it
is
that
dogs
are
the
favourite
prey
of
the
alligator
and
the
unfortunate
beagle
that
in
the
heat
of
the
chase
ventures
across
creek
or
lagoon
is
certain
to
be
attacked
by
these
ugly
amphibia
the
huge
reptile
then
was
being
lured
forward
by
the
voice
of
the
puppy
and
this
accounted
for
the
grand
overland
journey
he
was
making
there
was
no
longer
a
mystery
at
least
about
the
mode
in
which
the
alligator
was
attracted
onward
the
only
thing
that
remained
for
explanation
was
what
motive
had
the
mulatto
in
carrying
out
this
singular
manoeuvre
when
i
saw
him
take
to
his
hands
and
knees
i
had
been
under
the
impression
that
he
did
so
to
approach
the
house
without
being
observed
but
as
i
continued
to
watch
him
i
changed
my
mind
i
noticed
that
he
looked
oftener
and
with
more
anxiety
him
as
if
he
was
only
desirous
of
being
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
the
alligator
i
observed
too
that
he
changed
frequently
from
place
to
place
as
if
he
aimed
at
keeping
a
screen
of
the
plants
between
himself
and
his
follower
this
would
also
account
for
his
having
crossed
the
rows
of
the
as
already
noticed
after
all
it
was
only
some
freak
that
had
entered
the
fellow
brain
he
had
learned
this
curious
mode
of
coaxing
the
alligator
from
its
haunts
perhaps
old
hickman
had
shown
him
how
or
he
may
have
gathered
it
from
his
own
observation
while
in
the
swamps
he
was
taking
the
reptile
to
the
house
from
some
eccentric
motive
to
make
exhibition
of
it
among
his
fellows
to
have
a
lark
with
it
or
a
combat
between
it
and
the
or
for
some
like
purpose
i
could
not
divine
his
intention
and
would
have
thought
no
more
of
it
had
it
not
been
that
one
or
two
little
circumstances
had
made
an
impression
upon
me
i
was
struck
by
the
peculiar
pains
which
the
fellow
was
taking
to
accomplish
his
purpose
with
success
he
was
sparing
neither
trouble
nor
time
true
it
was
not
to
be
a
upon
the
plantation
it
was
a
holiday
and
the
time
was
his
own
but
it
was
not
the
habit
of
yellow
jake
to
be
abroad
at
so
early
an
hour
and
the
trouble
he
was
taking
was
not
in
consonance
with
his
character
of
habitual
and
idleness
some
strong
motive
then
must
have
been
urging
him
to
the
act
what
motive
i
pondered
upon
it
but
could
not
make
it
out
and
yet
i
felt
uneasiness
as
i
watched
him
it
was
an
undefined
feeling
and
i
could
assign
no
reason
for
it
beyond
the
fact
that
the
mulatto
was
a
bad
fellow
and
i
knew
him
to
be
capable
of
almost
any
wickedness
but
if
his
design
was
a
wicked
one
what
evil
could
he
effect
with
the
alligator
no
one
would
fear
the
reptile
upon
dry
ground
it
could
hurt
no
one
thus
i
reflected
and
still
did
i
feel
some
indefinite
apprehensions
but
for
this
feeling
i
should
have
given
over
observing
his
movements
and
turned
my
attention
to
the
herd
of
deer
which
i
now
perceived
approaching
up
the
savanna
and
coming
close
to
my
place
of
concealment
i
resisted
the
temptation
and
continued
to
watch
the
mulatto
a
little
longer
i
was
not
kept
much
longer
in
suspense
he
had
now
arrived
upon
the
outer
edge
of
the
hommock
which
he
did
not
enter
i
saw
him
turn
round
the
thicket
and
keep
on
towards
the
orangery
there
was
a
wicket
at
this
corner
which
he
passed
through
leaving
the
gate
open
behind
him
at
short
intervals
he
still
caused
the
dog
to
utter
its
involuntary
howlings
it
no
longer
needed
to
cry
loudly
for
the
alligator
was
now
close
in
the
rear
i
obtained
a
full
view
of
the
monster
as
it
passed
under
my
position
it
was
not
one
of
the
largest
though
it
was
several
yards
in
length
there
are
some
that
measure
more
than
a
statute
pole
this
one
was
full
twelve
feet
from
its
snout
to
the
extremity
of
its
tail
it
clutched
the
ground
with
its
broad
webbed
feet
as
it
crawled
forward
its
corrugated
skin
of
bluish
brown
colour
was
coated
with
slippery
mucus
that
glittered
under
the
sun
as
it
moved
and
large
masses
of
the
rested
in
the
concavities
between
its
rhomboid
scales
it
seemed
greatly
excited
and
whenever
it
heard
the
voice
of
the
dog
exhibited
fresh
symptoms
of
rage
it
would
erect
itself
upon
its
muscular
arms
raise
its
head
aloft
as
if
to
get
a
view
of
the
prey
lash
its
plaited
tail
into
the
air
and
swell
its
body
almost
to
double
its
natural
dimensions
at
the
same
time
it
emitted
loud
noises
from
its
throat
and
nostrils
that
resembled
the
rumbling
of
distant
thunder
and
its
musky
smell
filled
the
air
with
a
sickening
effluvium
a
more
monstrous
creature
it
would
be
impossible
to
conceive
even
the
fabled
dragon
could
not
have
been
more
horrible
to
behold
without
stopping
it
dragged
its
long
body
through
the
gate
still
following
the
direction
of
the
noise
the
leaves
of
the
evergreens
intervened
and
hid
the
hideous
reptile
from
my
sight
i
turned
my
face
in
the
opposite
direction
towards
the
house
to
watch
the
further
movements
of
the
mulatto
from
my
position
i
commanded
a
view
of
the
tank
and
could
see
nearly
all
around
it
the
inner
side
was
especially
under
my
view
as
it
lay
opposite
and
could
only
be
approached
through
the
orangery
between
the
grove
and
the
edge
of
the
great
basin
was
an
open
space
here
there
was
an
artificial
pond
only
a
few
yards
in
width
and
with
a
little
water
at
the
bottom
which
was
supplied
by
means
of
a
pump
from
the
main
reservoir
this
pond
or
rather
enclosure
was
the
a
place
in
which
turtle
were
fed
and
kept
to
be
ready
at
all
times
for
the
table
my
father
still
continued
his
habits
of
virginian
hospitality
and
in
florida
these
aldermanic
delicacies
are
easily
obtained
the
embankment
of
this
formed
the
direct
path
to
the
and
as
i
turned
i
saw
yellow
jake
upon
it
and
just
approaching
the
pond
he
still
carried
the
cur
in
his
arms
i
saw
that
he
was
causing
it
to
utter
a
continuous
howling
on
reaching
the
steps
that
led
down
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
back
i
noticed
that
he
looked
back
in
both
ways
first
towards
the
house
and
then
with
a
satisfied
air
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
no
doubt
he
saw
the
alligator
close
at
hand
for
without
further
hesitation
he
flung
the
puppy
far
out
into
the
water
and
then
retreating
along
the
embankment
of
the
he
entered
among
the
and
was
out
of
sight
the
whelp
thus
suddenly
plunged
into
the
cool
tank
kept
up
a
constant
howling
at
the
same
time
beating
the
water
violently
with
its
feet
in
the
endeavour
to
keep
itself
afloat
its
struggles
were
of
short
duration
the
alligator
now
guided
by
the
noise
of
moving
water
as
well
as
the
cries
of
the
dog
advanced
rapidly
to
the
edge
and
without
hesitating
a
moment
sprang
forward
into
the
pond
with
the
rapidity
of
an
arrow
it
darted
out
to
the
centre
and
seizing
the
victim
between
its
bony
jaws
dived
instantaneously
under
the
surface
i
could
for
some
time
trace
its
monstrous
form
far
down
in
the
diaphanous
water
but
guided
by
instinct
it
soon
entered
one
of
the
deep
wells
amidst
the
darkness
of
which
it
sank
out
of
sight
chapter
eight
the
king
vultures
so
then
my
yellow
friend
that
is
the
intention
a
bit
of
revenge
after
all
i
make
you
pay
for
it
you
spiteful
ruffian
you
little
thought
you
were
observed
ha
you
shall
rue
this
cunning
deviltry
before
night
some
such
soliloquy
escaped
my
lips
as
soon
as
i
comprehended
the
design
of
the
mulatto
manoeuvre
for
i
now
understood
it
at
least
i
thought
so
the
tank
was
full
of
beautiful
fish
there
were
gold
fish
and
silver
fish
hyodons
and
red
trout
they
were
my
sister
especial
pets
she
was
very
fond
of
them
it
was
her
custom
to
visit
them
daily
give
them
food
and
watch
their
gambols
many
an
aquatic
had
she
superintended
they
knew
her
person
would
follow
her
around
the
tank
and
take
food
out
of
her
fingers
she
delighted
in
thus
serving
them
the
revenge
lay
in
this
the
mulatto
well
knew
that
the
alligator
lives
upon
fish
they
are
his
natural
food
and
that
those
in
the
tank
pent
up
as
they
were
would
soon
become
his
prey
so
strong
a
tyrant
would
soon
ravage
the
preserve
killing
the
helpless
creatures
by
scores
of
course
to
the
chagrin
and
grief
of
their
fond
mistress
and
the
joy
of
yellow
jake
i
knew
that
the
fellow
disliked
my
little
sister
the
spirited
part
she
had
played
in
having
him
punished
for
the
affair
with
viola
had
kindled
his
resentment
against
her
but
since
then
there
had
been
other
little
incidents
to
increase
it
she
had
favoured
the
suit
of
his
rival
with
the
quadroon
and
had
forbidden
the
woodman
to
approach
viola
in
her
presence
these
circumstances
had
certainly
rendered
the
fellow
hostile
to
her
and
although
there
was
no
outward
show
of
this
feeling
there
dared
not
be
i
was
nevertheless
aware
of
the
fact
his
killing
the
fawn
had
proved
it
and
the
present
was
a
fresh
instance
of
the
implacable
spirit
of
the
man
he
calculated
upon
the
alligator
soon
making
havoc
among
the
fish
of
course
he
knew
it
would
in
time
be
discovered
and
killed
but
likely
not
before
many
of
the
finest
should
be
destroyed
no
one
would
ever
dream
that
the
creature
had
been
there
for
on
more
than
one
occasion
alligators
had
found
their
way
into
the
tank
having
strayed
from
the
river
or
the
neighbouring
lagoons
or
rather
having
been
guided
thither
by
an
unexplained
instinct
which
enables
these
creatures
to
travel
straight
in
the
direction
of
water
such
thought
i
were
the
designs
and
conjectures
of
yellow
jake
it
proved
afterwards
that
i
had
fathomed
but
half
his
plan
i
was
too
young
too
innocent
of
wickedness
even
to
guess
at
the
intense
malice
of
which
the
human
heart
is
capable
my
first
impulse
was
to
follow
the
mulatto
to
the
house
make
known
what
he
had
done
have
him
punished
and
then
return
with
a
party
to
destroy
the
alligator
before
he
could
do
any
damage
among
the
fish
at
this
crisis
the
deer
claimed
my
attention
the
herd
an
antlered
buck
with
several
does
had
browsed
close
up
to
the
hommock
they
were
within
two
hundred
yards
of
where
i
stood
the
sight
was
too
tempting
i
remembered
the
promise
to
my
mother
it
must
be
kept
venison
must
be
obtained
at
all
hazards
but
there
was
no
hazard
the
alligator
had
already
eaten
his
breakfast
with
a
whole
dog
in
his
maw
it
was
not
likely
he
would
disturb
the
finny
denizens
of
the
tank
for
some
hours
to
come
and
as
for
yellow
jake
i
saw
he
had
proceeded
on
to
the
house
he
could
be
found
at
any
moment
his
chastisement
could
stand
over
till
my
return
with
these
reflections
passing
through
my
mind
i
abandoned
my
first
design
and
turned
my
attention
exclusively
to
the
game
they
were
too
distant
for
the
range
of
my
rifle
and
i
waited
a
while
in
the
hope
that
they
would
move
nearer
but
i
waited
in
vain
the
deer
is
shy
of
the
hommock
it
regards
the
evergreen
islet
as
dangerous
ground
and
habitually
keeps
aloof
from
it
natural
enough
since
there
the
creature
is
oft
saluted
by
the
twang
of
the
indian
bow
or
the
crack
of
the
hunter
rifle
thence
often
reaches
it
the
deadly
missile
perceiving
that
the
game
was
getting
no
nearer
but
the
contrary
i
resolved
to
course
them
and
gliding
down
from
the
rock
i
descended
through
the
copsewood
to
the
edge
of
plain
on
reaching
the
open
ground
i
rushed
forward
at
the
same
time
unleashing
the
dogs
and
crying
the
view
hilloo
it
was
a
splendid
chase
led
on
by
the
old
buck
the
dogs
following
i
thought
i
never
saw
deer
run
so
fleetly
it
appeared
as
if
scarcely
a
score
of
seconds
had
transpired
while
they
were
crossing
the
savanna
more
than
a
mile
in
width
i
had
a
full
and
perfect
view
of
the
whole
there
was
no
obstruction
either
to
run
of
the
animals
or
the
eye
of
the
observer
the
grass
had
been
browsed
short
by
the
cattle
and
not
a
bush
grew
upon
the
green
plain
so
that
it
was
a
trial
of
pure
speed
between
dogs
and
deer
so
swiftly
ran
the
deer
i
began
to
feel
apprehensive
about
the
venison
my
apprehensions
were
speedily
at
an
end
just
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
savanna
the
chase
ended
so
far
at
least
as
the
dogs
were
concerned
and
one
of
the
deer
i
saw
that
they
had
flung
a
doe
and
were
standing
over
her
one
of
them
holding
her
by
the
throat
i
hurried
forward
ten
minutes
brought
me
to
the
spot
and
after
a
short
struggle
the
quarry
was
killed
and
bled
i
was
satisfied
with
my
dogs
with
the
sport
with
my
own
exploits
i
was
happy
at
the
prospect
of
being
able
to
redeem
my
promise
and
with
the
carcass
across
my
shoulders
i
turned
triumphantly
homeward
as
i
faced
round
i
saw
the
shadow
of
wings
moving
over
the
sunlit
savanna
i
looked
upward
two
large
birds
were
above
me
in
the
air
they
were
at
no
great
height
nor
were
they
endeavouring
to
mount
higher
on
the
contrary
they
were
wheeling
in
spiral
rings
that
seemed
to
incline
downward
at
each
successive
circuit
they
made
around
me
at
first
glance
the
sun
beams
were
in
my
eyes
and
i
could
not
tell
what
birds
were
flapping
above
me
on
facing
round
i
had
the
sun
in
my
favour
and
his
rays
glancing
full
upon
the
soft
plumage
enabled
me
to
recognise
the
species
they
were
the
most
beautiful
birds
of
their
tribe
i
am
almost
tempted
to
say
the
most
beautiful
birds
in
creation
certainly
they
take
rank
among
those
most
distinguished
in
the
world
of
ornithology
these
birds
are
natives
of
the
flowery
land
but
stray
no
farther
north
their
haunt
is
on
the
green
everglades
and
wide
savannas
of
florida
on
the
llanos
of
the
orinoco
and
the
plains
of
the
apure
in
florida
they
are
rare
though
not
in
all
parts
of
it
but
their
appearance
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
plantations
excites
an
interest
similar
to
that
which
is
occasioned
by
the
flight
of
an
eagle
not
so
with
the
other
vultures
and
both
of
which
are
as
common
as
crows
in
proof
that
the
king
vultures
are
rare
i
may
state
that
my
sister
had
never
seen
one
except
at
a
great
distance
off
yet
this
young
lady
was
twelve
years
of
age
and
a
native
of
the
land
true
she
had
not
gone
much
abroad
seldom
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
plantation
i
remembered
her
expressing
an
ardent
desire
to
view
more
closely
one
of
these
beautiful
birds
i
remembered
it
that
moment
and
at
once
formed
the
design
of
gratifying
her
wish
the
birds
were
near
enough
so
near
that
i
could
distinguish
the
deep
yellow
colour
of
their
throats
the
coral
red
upon
their
crowns
and
the
orange
lappets
that
drooped
along
their
beaks
they
were
near
enough
within
half
reach
of
my
rifle
but
moving
about
as
they
were
it
would
have
required
a
better
marksman
than
i
to
have
brought
one
of
them
down
with
a
bullet
i
did
not
think
of
trying
it
in
that
way
another
idea
was
in
my
mind
and
without
farther
pause
i
proceeded
to
carry
it
out
i
saw
that
the
vultures
had
espied
the
body
of
the
doe
where
it
lay
across
my
shoulders
that
was
why
they
were
hovering
above
me
my
plan
was
simple
enough
i
laid
the
carcass
upon
the
earth
and
taking
my
rifle
walked
away
towards
the
timber
trees
grew
at
fifty
yards
distance
from
where
i
had
placed
the
doe
and
behind
the
nearest
of
these
i
took
my
stand
i
had
not
long
to
wait
the
unconscious
birds
wheeled
lower
and
lower
and
at
length
one
alighted
on
the
earth
its
companion
had
not
time
to
join
it
before
the
rifle
cracked
and
laid
the
beautiful
creature
lifeless
upon
the
grass
the
other
frighted
by
the
sound
rose
higher
and
higher
and
then
flew
away
over
the
tops
of
the
cypresses
again
i
shouldered
my
venison
and
carrying
the
bird
in
my
hand
started
homeward
my
heart
was
full
of
exultation
i
anticipated
a
double
pleasure
from
the
double
pleasure
i
was
to
create
i
should
make
happy
the
two
beings
that
of
all
on
earth
were
dearest
to
me
my
fond
mother
my
beautiful
sister
i
soon
recrossed
the
savanna
and
entered
the
orangery
i
did
not
stay
to
go
round
by
the
wicket
but
climbed
over
the
fence
at
its
lower
end
so
happy
was
i
that
my
load
felt
light
as
a
feather
exultingly
i
strode
forward
dashing
the
loaded
boughs
from
my
path
i
sent
their
golden
globes
rolling
hither
and
thither
what
mattered
a
bushel
of
oranges
i
reached
the
parterre
my
mother
was
in
the
verandah
she
saw
me
as
i
approached
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
i
flung
the
spoils
of
the
chase
at
her
feet
i
had
kept
my
promise
what
is
that
a
bird
yes
the
king
vulture
a
present
for
virgine
where
is
she
not
up
yet
ha
the
little
sluggard
i
shall
soon
arouse
her
still
abed
and
on
such
a
beautiful
morning
you
wrong
her
george
she
has
been
up
on
hour
or
more
she
has
been
playing
and
has
just
this
moment
left
off
but
where
is
she
now
in
the
no
she
has
gone
to
the
bath
to
yes
she
and
viola
what
o
mother
mother
tell
me
george
o
heavens
chapter
nine
the
bath
yellow
jake
the
alligator
they
were
all
the
words
i
could
utter
my
mother
entreated
an
explanation
i
could
not
stay
to
give
it
frantic
with
apprehension
i
tore
myself
away
leaving
her
in
a
state
of
terror
that
rivalled
my
own
i
ran
towards
the
hommock
the
bath
i
wait
not
to
follow
the
devious
route
of
the
walk
but
keep
straight
on
leaping
over
such
obstacles
as
present
themselves
i
spring
across
the
paling
and
rush
through
the
orangery
causing
the
branches
to
crackle
and
the
fruit
to
fall
my
ears
are
keenly
bent
to
catch
every
sound
behind
are
sounds
enough
i
hear
my
mother
voice
uttered
in
accents
of
terror
already
have
her
cries
alarmed
the
house
and
are
echoed
and
answered
by
the
domestics
both
females
and
men
dogs
startled
by
the
sudden
excitement
are
baying
within
the
enclosure
and
fowls
and
caged
birds
screech
in
concert
from
behind
come
all
these
noises
it
is
not
for
them
my
ears
are
bent
i
am
listening
me
in
this
direction
i
now
hear
sounds
the
plashing
of
water
is
in
my
ears
and
mingling
with
the
tones
of
a
clear
silvery
voice
it
is
the
voice
of
my
sister
ha
ha
ha
the
ring
of
laughter
thank
heaven
she
is
safe
i
stay
my
step
under
the
influence
of
a
delicate
thought
i
call
aloud
virgine
virgine
impatiently
i
wait
the
reply
none
reaches
me
the
noise
of
the
water
has
drowned
my
voice
i
call
again
and
louder
virgine
sister
virgine
i
am
heard
and
hear
who
calls
you
georgy
yes
it
is
i
virgine
and
pray
what
want
you
brother
o
sister

out
of
the
bath
for
what
reason
should
i
our
friends
come
they
are
early
let
them
wait
my
georgy
go
you
and
entertain
them
i
mean
to
enjoy
myself
this
most
beautiful
of
mornings
the
water
just
right
delightful
is
it
viola
ho
i
shall
have
a
swim
round
the
pond
here
goes
and
then
there
was
a
fresh
plashing
in
the
water
mingled
with
a
cheerful
abandon
of
laughter
in
the
voices
of
my
sister
and
her
maid
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
hear
me
virgine
dear
sister
for
heaven
sake
come
out
come
there
was
a
sudden
cessation
of
the
merry
tones
then
came
a
short
sharp
ejaculation
followed
almost
instantaneously
by
a
wild
scream
i
perceived
that
neither
was
a
reply
to
my
appeal
i
had
called
out
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
sufficient
to
have
raised
apprehension
but
the
voices
that
now
reached
me
were
uttered
in
accents
of
terror
in
my
voice
i
heard
the
words
see
viola
o
mercy
the
monster
ha
he
is
coming
this
way
o
mercy
help
george
help
save
save
me
well
knew
i
the
meaning
of
the
summons
too
well
could
i
comprehend
the
words
and
the
continued
screaming
that
succeeded
them
sister
i
come
i
come
quick
as
thought
i
dashed
forward
breaking
through
the
boughs
that
still
intercepted
my
view
oh
perhaps
i
shall
be
too
late
she
screams
in
agony
she
is
already
in
the
grasp
of
the
alligator
a
dozen
bounds
carried
me
clear
of
the
grove
and
gliding
along
the
embankment
of
the
i
stood
by
the
edge
of
the
tank
a
fearful
tableau
was
before
me
my
sister
was
near
the
centre
of
the
basin
swimming
towards
the
edge
there
stood
the
quadroon
knee
deep
screeching
and
flinging
her
arms
frantically
in
the
air
beyond
appeared
the
gigantic
lizard
his
whole
body
arms
hands
and
claws
clearly
traceable
in
the
pellucid
water
above
the
surface
of
which
rose
the
scaly
serrature
of
his
back
and
shoulders
his
snout
and
tail
projected
still
higher
and
with
the
latter
he
was
lashing
the
water
into
white
froth
that
already
mottled
the
surface
of
the
pond
he
was
not
ten
feet
from
his
intended
victim
his
gaunt
jaws
almost
touched
the
green
baize
skirt
that
floated
behind
her
at
any
moment
he
might
have
darted
forward
and
seized
her
my
sister
was
swimming
with
all
her
might
she
was
a
capital
swimmer
but
what
could
it
avail
her
was
impeding
her
but
what
mattered
that
the
alligator
might
have
seized
her
at
any
moment
with
a
single
effort
could
have
caught
her
and
yet
he
had
not
made
it
i
wondered
why
he
had
not
i
wondered
that
he
still
held
back
i
wonder
to
this
hour
for
it
is
not
yet
explained
i
can
account
for
it
only
on
one
supposition
that
he
felt
that
his
victim
was
perfectly
within
his
power
and
as
the
cat
cajoles
with
the
mouse
so
was
he
indulging
in
the
plenitude
of
his
tyrant
strength
these
observations
were
made
in
a
single
second
of
time
while
i
was
cocking
my
rifle
i
aimed
and
fired
there
were
but
two
places
where
the
shot
could
have
proved
fatal
the
eye
or
behind
the
forearm
i
aimed
for
the
eye
i
hit
the
shoulder
but
from
that
hard
corrugated
skin
my
bullet
glinted
as
from
a
granite
rock
among
the
rhomboid
protuberances
it
made
a
whitish
score
and
that
was
all
the
play
of
the
monster
was
brought
to
a
termination
the
shot
appeared
to
have
given
him
pain
at
all
events
it
roused
him
to
more
earnest
action
and
perhaps
impelled
him
to
the
final
spring
he
made
it
the
instant
after
lashing
the
water
with
his
broad
tail
as
if
to
gain
impetus
he
darted
forward
his
huge
jaw
hinged
vertically
upward
till
the
red
throat
showed
wide
agape
and
the
next
moment
the
floating
skirt
and
oh
the
limbs
of
my
sister
were
in
his
horrid
gripe
i
plunged
in
and
swam
towards
them
the
gun
i
still
carried
in
my
grasp
it
hindered
me
i
dropped
it
to
the
bottom
and
swam
on
i
caught
virgine
in
my
arms
i
was
just
in
time
for
the
alligator
was
dragging
her
below
with
all
my
strength
i
held
her
up
it
needed
all
to
keep
us
above
the
surface
i
had
no
weapon
and
if
i
had
been
armed
i
could
not
have
spared
a
hand
to
strike
i
shouted
with
all
my
voice
in
the
hope
of
intimidating
the
assailant
and
causing
him
to
let
go
his
hold
it
was
to
no
purpose
he
still
held
on
o
heavens
we
shall
both
be
dragged
under
drowned
devoured
a
plunge
as
of
one
leaping
from
a
high
elevation
into
the
pond
a
quick
bold
swimmer
from
the
shore
a
face
with
long
black
hair
that
floats
behind
it
on
the
water
a
breast
gleaming
with
bright
spangles
a
body
clad
in
garments
a
man
a
boy
who
is
this
strange
youth
that
rushes
to
our
rescue
he
is
already
by
our
side
by
the
side
of
our
terrible
antagonist
with
all
the
earnest
energy
of
his
look
he
utters
not
a
word
he
rests
one
hand
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
huge
lizard
and
with
a
sudden
spring
places
himself
upon
its
back
a
rider
could
not
have
leaped
more
adroitly
to
the
saddle
a
knife
gleams
in
his
uplifted
hand
it
descends
its
blade
is
buried
in
the
eye
of
the
alligator
the
roar
of
the
saurian
betokens
its
pain
the
earth
vibrates
with
the
sound
the
froth
flies
up
under
the
lashings
of
its
tail
and
a
cloud
of
spray
is
flung
over
us
but
the
monster
has
now
relaxed
its
gripe
and
i
am
swimming
with
my
sister
to
the
shore
a
glance
backward
reveals
to
me
a
strange
sight
i
see
the
alligator
diving
to
the
bottom
with
the
bold
rider
upon
its
back
he
is
lost
he
is
lost
with
painful
thoughts
i
swim
on
i
climb
out
and
place
my
fainting
sister
upon
the
bank
i
again
look
back
joy
joy
the
strange
youth
is
once
more
above
the
surface
and
swimming
freely
to
the
shore
upon
the
further
side
of
the
pond
the
hideous
form
is
also
above
water
struggling
by
the
edge
frantic
and
furious
with
the
agony
of
its
wounds
joy
joy
my
sister
is
unharmed
the
floating
skirt
has
saved
her
scarcely
a
scratch
shows
upon
her
delicate
limbs
and
now
in
tender
arms
amidst
sweet
words
and
looks
of
kind
sympathy
she
is
borne
away
from
the
scene
of
her
peril
chapter
ten
the
the
alligator
was
soon
clubbed
to
death
and
dragged
to
the
shore
a
work
of
delight
to
the
blacks
of
the
plantation
no
one
suspected
how
the
reptile
had
got
to
the
pond
for
i
had
not
said
a
word
to
any
one
the
belief
was
that
it
had
wandered
there
from
the
river
or
the
lagoons
as
others
had
done
before
and
yellow
jake
the
most
active
of
all
in
its
destruction
was
heard
several
times
repeating
this
hypothesis
little
did
the
villain
suspect
that
his
secret
was
known
i
thought
that
besides
himself
i
was
the
only
one
privy
to
it
in
this
however
i
was
mistaken
the
domestics
had
gone
back
to
the
house
toating
the
huge
carcass
with
ropes
and
uttering
shouts
of
triumph
i
was
alone
with
our
gallant
preserver
i
stayed
behind
purposely
to
thank
him
mother
father
all
had
given
expression
to
their
gratitude
all
had
signified
their
admiration
of
his
gallant
conduct
even
my
sister
who
had
recovered
consciousness
before
being
carried
away
had
thanked
him
with
kind
words
he
made
no
reply
further
than
to
acknowledge
the
compliments
paid
him
and
this
he
did
either
by
a
smile
or
a
simple
inclination
of
the
head
with
the
years
of
a
boy
he
seemed
to
possess
the
gravity
of
a
man
he
appeared
about
my
own
age
and
size
his
figure
was
perfectly
proportioned
and
his
face
handsome
the
complexion
was
not
that
of
a
pure
indian
though
the
style
of
his
dress
was
so
his
skin
was
nearer
brunette
than
bronze
he
was
evidently
a
his
nose
was
slightly
aquiline
which
gave
him
that
fine
peculiar
to
some
of
the
north
american
tribes
and
his
eye
though
mild
in
common
mood
was
easily
lighted
up
under
excitement
as
i
had
just
witnessed
it
shone
with
the
brilliancy
of
fire
the
admixture
of
caucasian
blood
had
tamed
down
the
prominence
of
indian
features
to
a
perfect
regularity
without
robbing
them
of
their
heroic
grandeur
of
expression
and
the
black
hair
was
finer
than
that
of
the
pure
native
though
equally
shining
and
luxuriant
in
short
the
of
this
strange
youth
was
that
of
a
noble
and
handsome
boy
that
another
brace
of
summers
would
develop
into
a
man
even
as
a
boy
there
was
an
individuality
about
him
that
when
once
seen
was
not
to
be
forgotten
i
have
said
that
his
costume
was
indian
so
was
it
purely
indian
not
made
up
altogether
of
the
spoils
of
the
chase
for
the
buckskin
has
long
ceased
to
be
the
wear
of
the
aborigines
of
florida
his
moccasins
alone
were
of
dressed
deer
hide
his
leggings
were
of
scarlet
cloth
and
his
tunic
of
figured
cotton
stuff
all
three
elaborately
beaded
and
embroidered
with
these
he
wore
a
wampum
belt
and
a
fillet
encircled
his
head
above
which
rose
erect
three
plumes
from
the
tail
of
the
king
vulture
which
among
indians
is
an
around
his
neck
were
strings
of
beads
and
upon
his
breast
three
of
silver
suspended
one
above
the
other
thus
was
the
youth
attired
and
despite
the
soaking
which
his
garments
had
received
he
presented
an
aspect
as
once
noble
and
picturesque
you
are
sure
you
have
received
no
injury
i
inquired
for
the
second
time
quite
sure
not
the
slightest
injury
but
you
are
wet
through
and
through
let
me
offer
you
a
change
of
clothes
mine
i
think
would
about
fit
you
thank
you
i
should
not
know
how
to
wear
them
the
sun
is
strong
my
own
will
soon
be
dry
again
you
will
come
up
to
the
house
and
eat
something
i
have
eaten
but
a
short
while
ago
i
thank
you
i
am
not
in
need
some
wine
again
i
thank
you
water
is
my
only
drink
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
to
my
new
acquaintance
he
refused
all
my
offers
of
hospitality
and
yet
he
remained
by
me
he
would
not
accompany
me
to
the
house
and
still
he
showed
no
signs
of
taking
his
departure
was
he
expecting
something
else
a
reward
for
his
services
something
more
substantial
than
complimentary
phrases
the
thought
was
not
unnatural
handsome
as
was
the
youth
he
was
but
an
indian
of
compliments
he
had
had
enough
indians
care
little
for
idle
words
it
might
be
that
he
waited
for
something
more
it
was
but
natural
for
one
in
his
condition
to
do
so
and
equally
natural
for
one
in
mine
to
think
so
in
an
instant
my
purse
was
out
in
the
next
it
was
in
his
hands
and
in
the
next
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
i
did
not
ask
you
for
money
said
he
as
he
flung
the
dollars
indignantly
into
the
water
i
felt
pique
and
shame
the
latter
predominated
i
plunged
into
the
pond
and
dived
under
the
surface
it
was
not
after
my
purse
but
my
rifle
which
i
saw
lying
upon
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
i
gained
the
piece
and
carrying
it
ashore
handed
it
to
him
the
peculiar
smile
with
which
he
received
it
told
me
that
i
had
well
corrected
my
error
and
subdued
the
capricious
pride
of
the
singular
youth
it
is
my
turn
to
make
reparation
said
he
permit
me
to
restore
you
your
purse
and
to
ask
pardon
for
my
rudeness
before
i
could
interpose
he
sprang
into
the
water
and
dived
below
the
surface
he
soon
recovered
the
shining
object
and
returning
to
the
bank
placed
it
in
my
hands
this
is
a
splendid
gift
he
said
handling
the
rifle
and
examining
it
a
splendid
gift
and
i
must
return
home
before
i
can
offer
you
aught
in
return
we
indians
have
not
much
that
the
white
man
values
only
i
have
been
told
he
uttered
this
phrase
with
peculiar
emphasis
our
rude
manufactures
continued
he
are
worthless
things
when
put
in
comparison
with
those
of
your
people
they
are
but
curiosities
to
you
at
best
but
stay
you
are
a
hunter
will
you
accept
a
pair
of
moccasins
and
a
maumee
makes
them
well
maumee
my
sister
you
will
find
the
moccasin
better
for
hunting
than
those
heavy
shoes
you
wear
the
tread
is
more
silent
above
all
things
i
should
like
to
have
a
pair
of
your
moccasins
i
am
rejoiced
that
it
will
gratify
you
maumee
shall
make
them
and
the
pouch
too
maumee
i
mentally
echoed
strange
sweet
name
can
it
be
she
i
was
thinking
of
a
bright
being
that
had
crossed
my
path
a
dream
a
heavenly
vision
for
it
seemed
too
lovely
to
be
of
the
earth
while
wandering
in
the
woods
amid
perfumed
groves
had
this
vision
appeared
to
me
in
the
form
of
an
indian
maiden
in
a
flowery
glade
i
saw
her
one
of
those
spots
in
the
southern
forest
which
nature
adorns
so
profusely
she
appeared
to
form
part
of
the
picture
one
glance
had
i
and
she
was
gone
i
pursued
but
to
no
purpose
like
a
spirit
she
glided
through
the
daedalian
aisles
of
the
grove
and
i
saw
her
no
more
but
though
gone
from
my
sight
she
passed
not
out
of
my
memory
ever
since
had
i
been
dreaming
of
that
lovely
apparition
was
it
maumee
your
name
i
inquired
as
i
saw
the
youth
was
about
to
depart
i
am
called
powell
by
the
whites
my
father
name
he
was
white
he
is
dead
my
mother
still
lives
i
need
not
say
she
is
an
indian
i
must
be
gone
sir
continued
he
after
a
pause
before
i
leave
you
permit
me
to
put
a
question
it
may
appear
impertinent
but
i
have
good
reason
for
asking
it
have
you
among
your
slaves
one
who
is
very
bad
one
who
is
hostile
to
your
family
there
is
such
a
one
i
have
reason
to
believe
it
would
you
know
his
tracks
i
should
then
follow
me
it
is
not
necessary
i
can
guess
where
you
would
lead
me
i
know
all
he
lured
the
alligator
hither
to
destroy
my
sister
ugh
exclaimed
the
young
indian
in
some
surprise
how
learned
you
this
sir
from
yonder
rock
i
was
a
witness
of
the
whole
transaction
but
how
did
come
to
know
of
it
i
asked
in
turn
only
by
following
the
trail
the
man
the
dog
the
alligator
i
was
hunting
by
the
swamp
i
saw
the
tracks
i
suspected
something
and
crossed
the
fields
i
had
reached
the
thicket
when
i
heard
cries
i
was
just
in
time
ugh
you
were
in
good
time
else
the
villain
would
have
succeeded
in
his
intent
fear
not
friend
he
shall
be
punished
good
he
should
be
punished
i
hope
you
and
i
may
meet
again
a
few
words
more
were
exchanged
between
us
and
then
we
shook
hands
and
parted
chapter
eleven
the
chase
about
the
guilt
of
the
mulatto
i
had
no
longer
any
doubt
the
mere
destruction
of
the
fish
could
not
have
been
his
design
he
would
never
have
taken
such
pains
to
accomplish
so
trifling
a
purpose
no
his
intent
was
far
more
horrid
it
comprehended
a
deeper
scheme
of
cruelty
and
vengeance
its
aim
was
my
sister
life
viola
perhaps
both
awful
as
was
such
a
belief
there
was
no
room
left
to
doubt
it
every
circumstance
confirmed
it
even
the
young
indian
had
formed
the
opinion
that
such
was
the
design
at
this
season
my
sister
was
in
the
habit
of
bathing
almost
every
day
and
that
this
was
her
custom
was
known
to
all
upon
the
plantation
had
not
thought
of
it
when
i
went
in
pursuit
of
the
deer
else
i
should
in
all
probability
have
acted
in
a
different
manner
but
who
could
have
suspected
such
dire
villainy
the
cunning
of
the
act
quite
equalled
its
malice
by
the
merest
accident
there
were
witnesses
but
had
there
been
none
it
is
probable
the
event
would
have
answered
the
intention
and
my
sister
life
been
sacrificed
who
could
have
told
the
author
of
the
crime
the
reptile
would
have
been
alone
responsible
even
suspicion
would
not
have
rested
upon
the
mulatto
how
could
it
the
yellow
villain
had
shown
a
fiendish
craft
in
his
calculation
i
was
burning
with
indignation
my
poor
innocent
sister
little
did
she
know
the
foul
means
that
had
been
made
use
of
to
put
her
in
such
peril
she
was
aware
that
the
mulatto
liked
her
not
but
never
dreamed
she
that
she
was
the
object
of
such
a
demoniac
spite
as
this
the
very
thoughts
of
it
fired
me
as
i
dwelt
upon
them
i
could
restrain
myself
no
longer
the
criminal
must
be
brought
to
punishment
and
at
once
some
severe
castigation
must
be
inflicted
upon
him
something
that
would
place
it
beyond
his
power
to
repeat
such
dangerous
attempts
how
he
would
be
dealt
with
i
could
not
tell
that
must
be
left
to
my
elders
to
determine
the
lash
had
proved
of
no
avail
perhaps
the
would
cure
him
at
all
events
he
must
be
banished
the
plantation
in
my
own
mind
i
had
not
doomed
him
to
death
though
truly
he
deserved
it
indignant
as
i
felt
i
did
not
contemplate
this
ultimate
punishment
of
crime
used
to
my
father
mild
rule
i
did
not
the
lash
the
county
prison
the
at
saint
marks
or
san
augustine
some
of
these
would
likely
be
his
reward
i
knew
it
would
not
be
left
to
the
lenient
disposition
of
my
father
to
decide
the
whole
community
of
planters
was
interested
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
an
improvised
jury
would
soon
assemble
no
doubt
harsher
judges
than
his
own
master
would
deal
with
the
guilty
man
i
stayed
not
longer
to
reflect
i
was
determined
his
trial
should
be
immediate
i
ran
towards
the
house
with
the
intention
of
declaring
his
guilt
in
my
haste
as
before
i
did
not
follow
the
usual
path
which
was
somewhat
circumambient
i
made
direct
through
the
grove
i
had
advanced
only
a
few
paces
when
i
heard
a
rustling
of
the
leaves
near
me
i
could
see
no
one
but
felt
sure
that
the
noise
was
caused
by
some
person
skulking
among
the
trees
perhaps
one
of
the
taking
advantage
of
the
confusion
of
the
hour
and
helping
himself
to
a
few
oranges
compared
with
my
purpose
such
slight
dereliction
was
a
matter
of
no
importance
and
i
did
not
think
worth
while
to
stay
and
hinder
it
i
only
shouted
out
but
no
one
made
answer
and
i
kept
on
on
arriving
at
the
rear
of
the
house
i
found
my
father
in
the
enclosure
by
the
grand
shed
the
overseer
too
old
hickman
the
was
there
and
one
or
two
other
white
men
who
had
casually
come
upon
business
in
the
presence
of
all
i
made
the
disclosure
and
with
as
much
minuteness
as
the
time
would
permit
described
the
strange
transaction
i
had
witnessed
in
the
morning
all
were
thunderstruck
hickman
at
once
declared
the
probability
of
such
a
manoeuvre
though
no
one
doubted
my
words
the
only
doubt
was
as
to
the
mulatto
intent
could
it
have
been
human
lives
he
designed
to
sacrifice
it
seemed
too
great
a
wickedness
to
be
believed
it
was
too
horrible
even
to
be
imagined
at
that
moment
all
doubts
were
set
at
rest
another
testimony
was
added
to
mine
which
supplied
the
link
of
proof
that
was
wanting
black
jake
had
a
tale
to
tell
and
told
it
that
morning
but
half
an
hour
before
he
had
seen
yellow
jake
climb
up
into
a
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
enclosure
the
top
of
this
commanded
a
view
of
the
pond
it
was
just
at
the
time
that
white
missa
and
viola
went
to
the
bath
he
was
quite
sure
that
about
that
time
they
must
have
been
going
into
the
water
and
that
yellow
jake
have
seen
indignant
at
his
indecorous
conduct
the
black
had
shouted
to
the
mulatto
to
come
down
from
the
tree
and
threatened
to
complain
upon
him
the
latter
made
answer
that
he
was
only
gathering
acorns
the
acorns
of
the
are
sweet
food
and
much
sought
after
by
the
black
jake
however
was
positive
that
this
could
not
be
yellow
jake
purpose
for
the
former
still
continuing
to
threaten
the
latter
at
length
came
down
and
black
jake
saw
no
acorns
not
one
twa
acorn
he
war
arter
massa
randoff
daat
yaller
loafa
wa
arter
no
good
daat
he
wa
sure
sartin
so
concluded
the
testimony
of
the
groom
the
tale
produced
conviction
in
the
minds
of
all
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
doubt
of
the
mulatto
intention
horrible
as
it
was
he
had
ascended
the
tree
to
be
witness
of
the
foul
deed
he
had
seen
them
enter
the
basin
he
knew
the
danger
that
was
lurking
in
its
waters
and
yet
he
had
made
no
movement
to
give
the
alarm
on
the
contrary
he
was
among
the
last
who
had
hastened
towards
the
pond
when
the
screaming
of
the
girls
was
summoning
all
the
household
to
their
assistance
this
was
shown
by
the
evidence
of
others
the
case
was
clear
against
him
the
tale
produced
a
wild
excitement
white
men
and
black
men
masters
and
slaves
were
equally
indignant
at
the
horrid
crime
and
the
cry
went
round
the
yard
for
yellow
jake
some
ran
one
way
some
another
in
search
of
him
black
white
and
yellow
ran
together
all
eager
in
the
pursuit
all
desirous
that
such
a
monster
should
be
brought
to
punishment
where
was
he
his
name
was
called
aloud
over
and
over
again
with
commands
with
threats
but
no
answer
came
back
where
was
he
the
stables
were
searched
the
shed
the
kitchen
the
cabins
even
the
was
ransacked
but
to
no
purpose
where
had
he
gone
he
had
been
observed
but
the
moment
before
he
had
assisted
in
dragging
the
alligator
the
men
had
brought
it
into
the
enclosure
and
thrown
it
to
the
hogs
to
be
devoured
yellow
jake
had
been
with
them
active
as
any
at
the
work
it
was
but
the
moment
before
he
had
gone
away
but
where
no
one
could
tell
at
this
moment
i
remembered
the
rustling
among
the
it
might
have
been
he
if
so
he
may
have
overheard
the
conversation
between
the
young
indian
and
myself
or
the
last
part
of
it
and
if
so
he
would
now
be
far
away
i
led
the
pursuit
through
the
orangery
its
recesses
were
searched
he
was
not
there
the
hommock
thickets
were
next
entered
and
beaten
from
one
end
to
the
other
still
no
signs
of
the
missing
mulatto
it
occurred
to
me
to
climb
up
to
the
rock
my
former
place
of
observation
i
ascended
at
once
to
its
summit
and
was
rewarded
for
my
trouble
at
the
first
glance
over
the
fields
i
saw
the
fugitive
he
was
down
between
the
rows
of
the
indigo
plants
crawling
upon
hands
and
knees
evidently
making
for
the
maize
i
did
not
stay
to
observe
further
but
springing
back
to
the
ground
i
ran
after
him
my
father
hickman
and
others
followed
me
the
chase
was
not
conducted
in
silence
no
stratagem
was
used
and
by
our
shouts
the
mulatto
soon
learned
that
he
was
seen
and
pursued
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
and
rising
to
his
feet
he
ran
forward
with
all
his
speed
he
soon
entered
the
with
the
hue
and
cry
close
upon
his
heels
though
still
but
a
boy
i
was
the
fastest
runner
of
the
party
i
knew
that
i
could
run
faster
than
yellow
jake
and
if
i
could
only
keep
him
in
sight
i
should
soon
overtake
him
his
hopes
were
to
get
into
the
swamp
under
cover
of
the
palmetto
thickets
once
there
he
might
easily
escape
by
hiding
at
all
events
he
might
get
off
for
the
time
to
prevent
this
i
ran
at
my
utmost
speed
and
with
success
for
just
upon
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
came
up
with
the
runaway
and
caught
hold
of
the
loose
flap
of
his
jacket
it
was
altogether
a
foolish
attempt
upon
my
part
i
had
not
reflected
upon
anything
beyond
getting
up
with
him
i
had
never
thought
of
resistance
though
i
might
have
expected
it
from
a
desperate
man
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
i
was
under
the
hallucination
that
as
soon
as
i
should
come
up
the
fellow
would
yield
to
me
but
i
was
mistaken
he
at
once
jerked
himself
free
of
my
hold
and
easily
enough
my
breath
was
gone
my
strength
exhausted
i
could
not
have
held
a
cat
i
expected
him
to
run
on
as
before
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
turned
fiercely
upon
me
and
drawing
his
knife
he
plunged
it
through
my
arm
it
was
my
heart
he
had
aimed
at
but
by
suddenly
throwing
up
my
arm
i
had
warded
off
the
fatal
thrust
a
second
time
his
knife
was
upraised
and
i
should
have
had
a
second
stab
from
it
but
just
then
another
face
showed
itself
in
the
fray
and
before
the
dangerous
blade
could
descend
the
strong
arms
of
black
jake
were
around
my
antagonist
the
fiend
struggled
fiercely
to
free
himself
but
the
muscular
grasp
of
his
old
rival
never
became
relaxed
until
hickman
and
others
arrived
upon
the
ground
and
then
a
fast
binding
of
thongs
rendered
him
at
once
harmless
and
secure
chapter
twelve
a
severe
sentence
such
a
series
of
violent
incidents
of
course
created
excitement
beyond
our
own
boundaries
there
was
a
group
of
plantations
upon
the
river
lying
side
by
side
and
all
having
a
frontage
upon
the
water
they
formed
the
settlement
through
these
ran
the
report
spreading
like
wildfire
and
within
the
hour
white
men
could
be
seen
coming
from
every
direction
some
were
on
foot
poor
hunters
who
dwelt
on
the
skirts
of
the
large
plantations
others
the
planters
themselves
or
their
overseers
on
horseback
all
carried
weapons
rifles
and
pistols
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
it
the
rendezvous
of
a
militia
muster
but
the
serious
looks
of
those
who
assembled
gave
it
a
different
aspect
it
more
resembled
the
gathering
of
the
frontier
men
upon
the
report
of
some
indian
invasion
in
one
hour
more
than
fifty
white
men
were
upon
the
ground
nearly
all
who
belonged
to
the
settlement
a
jury
was
quickly
formed
and
yellow
jake
put
upon
his
trial
there
was
no
law
in
the
proceedings
though
legal
formality
was
followed
in
a
certain
rude
way
these
jurors
were
themselves
sovereign
they
were
the
lords
of
the
land
and
in
cases
like
this
could
easily
a
judge
they
soon
found
one
in
planter
ringgold
our
adjoining
neighbour
my
father
declined
to
take
part
in
the
proceedings
the
trial
was
rapidly
gone
through
with
the
facts
were
fresh
and
clear
i
was
before
their
eyes
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
badly
cut
the
other
circumstances
which
led
to
this
result
were
all
detailed
the
chain
of
guilt
was
complete
the
mulatto
had
attempted
the
lives
of
white
people
of
course
death
was
the
decree
what
mode
of
death
some
voted
for
hanging
but
by
most
of
these
men
hanging
was
deemed
too
mild
met
the
approbation
of
the
majority
the
judge
himself
cast
his
vote
for
the
severer
sentence
my
father
plead
mercy
at
least
so
far
as
to
spare
the
torture
but
the
stern
jurors
would
not
listen
to
him
they
had
all
lost
slaves
of
late
many
runaways
had
been
reported
the
proximity
of
the
indians
gave
encouragement
to
defection
they
charged
my
father
with
too
much
leniency
the
settlement
needed
an
example
they
would
make
one
of
yellow
jake
that
would
deter
all
who
were
disposed
to
imitate
him
his
sentence
was
that
he
should
be
thus
did
they
reason
and
thus
did
they
pronounce
it
is
a
grand
error
to
suppose
that
the
indians
of
north
america
have
been
peculiar
in
the
habit
of
torturing
their
captive
foes
in
most
cases
where
cruelty
has
been
practised
by
them
there
has
been
a
provocative
deed
of
anterior
date
some
grievous
wrong
and
the
torture
was
but
a
retaliation
human
nature
has
yielded
to
the
temptings
of
revenge
in
all
ages
and
ferocity
can
be
charged
with
as
much
justice
against
white
skin
as
against
red
skin
had
the
indians
written
the
story
of
border
warfare
the
world
might
have
modified
its
belief
in
their
so
called
cruelty
it
is
doubtful
if
in
all
their
history
instances
of
ferocity
can
be
found
that
will
parallel
those
often
perpetrated
by
white
men
upon
blacks
many
of
whom
have
suffered
mutilation
torture
death
for
the
mere
offence
of
a
word
certainly
often
for
a
blow
since
such
is
a
written
law
where
the
indians
have
practised
cruelty
it
has
almost
always
been
in
retaliation
but
civilised
tyrants
have
put
men
to
the
torture
without
even
the
palliating
apology
of
vengeance
if
there
was
revenge
it
was
not
of
that
natural
kind
to
which
the
human
heart
gives
way
when
it
conceives
deep
wrong
has
been
done
but
rather
a
mean
spite
such
as
is
often
exhibited
by
the
dastard
despot
towards
some
weak
individual
within
his
power
no
doubt
yellow
jake
deserved
death
his
crimes
were
capital
ones
but
to
him
was
the
will
of
his
judges
my
father
opposed
it
and
a
few
others
they
were
outvoted
and
overruled
the
awful
sentence
was
passed
and
they
who
had
decreed
it
at
once
set
about
carrying
it
into
execution
it
was
not
a
fit
scene
to
be
enacted
upon
a
gentleman
premises
and
a
spot
was
selected
at
some
distance
from
the
house
further
down
the
to
this
place
the
criminal
was
conducted
the
crowd
of
course
following
some
two
hundred
yards
from
the
bank
a
tree
was
chosen
as
the
place
of
execution
to
this
tree
the
condemned
was
to
be
bound
and
a
kindled
around
him
my
father
would
not
witness
the
execution
i
alone
of
oor
family
followed
to
the
scene
the
mulatto
saw
me
and
accosted
me
with
words
of
rage
he
even
taunted
me
about
the
wound
he
had
given
glorying
in
the
deed
he
was
no
doubt
under
the
belief
that
i
was
one
of
his
greatest
foes
i
had
certainly
been
the
innocent
witness
of
his
crime
and
chiefly
through
my
testimony
he
had
been
condemned
but
i
was
not
revengeful
i
would
have
spared
him
the
terrible
fate
he
was
about
to
undergo
at
least
its
tortures
we
arrived
upon
the
ground
men
were
already
before
us
collecting
the
logs
and
piling
them
up
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
others
were
striking
a
fire
some
joked
and
laughed
a
few
were
heard
giving
utterance
to
expressions
of
hate
for
the
whole
coloured
race
young
ringgold
was
especially
active
this
was
a
wild
youth
on
the
eve
of
manhood
of
somewhat
fierce
harsh
temper
a
family
characteristic
i
knew
that
the
young
fellow
affected
my
sister
virginia
i
had
often
noticed
his
partiality
for
her
and
he
could
scarcely
conceal
his
jealousy
of
others
who
came
near
her
his
father
was
the
richest
planter
in
the
settlement
and
the
son
proud
of
this
superiority
believed
himself
welcome
everywhere
i
did
not
think
he
was
very
welcome
with
virgine
though
i
could
not
tell
it
was
too
delicate
a
point
upon
which
to
question
her
for
the
little
dame
already
esteemed
herself
a
woman
ringgold
was
neither
handsome
nor
graceful
he
was
sufficiently
intelligent
but
overbearing
to
those
beneath
him
in
station
not
an
uncommon
fault
among
the
sons
of
rich
men
he
had
already
gained
the
character
of
being
resentful
in
addition
to
all
he
was
dissipated
too
often
found
with
low
company
in
the
forest
for
my
part
i
did
not
like
him
i
never
cared
to
be
with
him
as
a
companion
he
was
older
than
myself
but
it
was
not
that
i
did
not
like
his
disposition
not
so
my
father
and
mother
by
both
was
he
encouraged
to
frequent
our
house
both
probably
desired
him
for
a
future
they
saw
no
faults
in
him
the
glitter
of
gold
has
a
blinding
influence
upon
the
moral
eye
this
young
man
then
was
one
of
the
most
eager
for
the
punishment
of
the
mulatto
and
active
in
the
preparations
his
activity
arose
partly
from
a
natural
disposition
to
be
cruel
both
he
and
his
father
were
noted
as
hard
and
to
be
sold
to
mass
ringgold
was
a
fate
dreaded
by
every
slave
in
the
settlement
but
young
ringgold
had
another
motive
for
his
conspicuous
behaviour
he
fancied
he
was
playing
the
by
this
show
of
friendship
for
our
family
for
virginia
he
was
mistaken
such
unnecessary
cruelty
to
the
criminal
met
the
approbation
of
none
of
us
it
was
not
likely
to
purchase
a
smile
from
my
good
sister
the
young
powell
was
also
present
on
hearing
the
hue
and
cry
he
had
returned
and
now
stood
in
the
crowd
looking
on
but
taking
no
part
in
the
proceedings
just
then
the
eye
of
ringgold
rested
upon
the
indian
boy
and
i
could
perceive
that
it
was
instantly
lit
up
by
a
strange
expression
he
was
already
in
possession
of
all
the
details
he
saw
in
the
youth
the
gallant
preserver
of
virginia
life
but
it
was
not
with
gratitude
that
he
viewed
him
another
feeling
was
working
in
his
breast
as
could
plainly
be
perceived
by
the
scornful
curl
that
played
upon
his
lips
more
plainly
still
by
the
rude
speech
that
followed
hilloa
redskin
he
cried
out
addressing
himself
to
the
young
indian
you
sure
had
no
hand
in
this
business
eh
redskin
redskin
exclaimed
the
in
a
tone
of
indignation
at
the
same
time
fronting
proudly
to
his
insulter
redskin
you
call
me
my
skin
is
of
better
colour
than
yours
you
lout
ringgold
was
rather
of
a
sallow
complexion
the
blow
hit
home
not
quicker
is
the
flash
of
powder
than
was
its
effect
but
his
astonishment
at
being
thus
accosted
by
an
indian
combined
with
his
rage
hindered
him
for
some
moments
from
making
reply
others
were
before
him
and
cried
out
o
lordy
such
talk
from
an
injun
say
that
again
cried
ringgold
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
himself
again
if
you
wish
lout
cried
the
giving
full
emphasis
to
the
phrase
the
words
were
scarcely
out
before
ringgold
pistol
cracked
but
the
bullet
missed
its
aim
and
next
moment
the
two
clinched
seizing
each
other
by
the
throats
both
came
to
the
ground
but
the
had
the
advantage
he
was
uppermost
and
no
doubt
would
quickly
have
despatched
his
white
antagonist
for
the
ready
blade
was
gleaming
in
his
grasp
but
the
knife
was
struck
out
of
his
hand
and
a
crowd
of
men
rushing
to
the
spot
pulled
the
combatants
apart
some
were
loud
against
the
indian
lad
and
called
for
his
life
but
there
were
others
with
finer
ideas
of
fair
play
who
had
witnessed
the
provocation
and
despite
the
power
of
the
ringgolds
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
sacrificed
i
had
resolved
to
protect
him
as
far
as
i
was
able
what
would
have
been
the
result
it
is
difficult
to
guess
but
at
that
crisis
a
sudden
diversion
was
produced
by
the
cry
that
jake
had
chapter
thirteen
the
chase
i
looked
around
sure
enough
the
mulatto
was
making
off
the
rencontre
between
ringgold
and
the
indian
monopolised
attention
and
the
criminal
was
for
the
moment
forgotten
the
knife
knocked
out
of
powell
hand
had
fallen
at
the
feet
of
yellow
jake
unobserved
in
the
confusion
he
had
snatched
it
up
cut
the
fastenings
from
his
limbs
and
glided
off
before
any
one
could
intercept
him
several
clutched
at
him
as
he
passed
through
the
straggled
groups
but
being
naked
he
was
able
to
glide
out
of
their
grasp
and
in
a
dozen
bounds
he
had
cleared
the
crowd
and
was
running
towards
the
shore
of
the
lake
it
seemed
a
mad
attempt
he
would
be
shot
down
or
overtaken
even
so
it
was
not
madness
to
fly
from
certain
death
and
such
a
death
shots
were
ringing
at
first
they
were
the
reports
of
pistols
the
guns
had
been
laid
aside
and
were
leaning
against
trees
and
the
adjacent
fence
their
owners
now
ran
to
seize
them
one
after
another
was
levelled
and
then
followed
a
sharp
rapid
cracking
like
from
a
corps
of
riflemen
there
may
have
been
good
marksmen
among
the
party
there
were
some
of
the
best
but
a
man
running
for
his
life
and
bounding
from
side
to
side
to
avoid
the
stumps
and
bushes
offers
but
a
very
uncertain
mark
and
the
best
shot
may
miss
so
it
appeared
on
this
occasion
after
the
last
rifle
rang
the
runaway
was
still
seen
keeping
his
onward
course
apparently
unscathed
the
moment
after
he
plunged
into
the
water
and
swam
boldly
out
from
the
shore
some
set
to
reloading
their
guns
others
despairing
of
the
time
flung
them
away
and
hastily
pulling
off
hats
coats
boots
rushed
down
to
the
lake
and
plunged
in
after
the
fugitive
in
less
than
three
minutes
from
the
time
that
the
mulatto
started
off
a
new
tableau
was
formed
the
spot
that
was
to
have
been
the
scene
of
execution
was
completely
deserted
one
half
the
crowd
was
down
by
the
shore
shouting
and
gesticulating
the
other
half
full
twenty
in
all
had
taken
to
the
water
and
were
swimming
in
perfect
silence
their
heads
alone
showing
above
the
surface
away
beyond
full
fifty
paces
in
advance
of
the
foremost
appeared
that
solitary
swimmer
the
object
of
pursuit
his
head
of
black
tangled
curls
conspicuous
above
the
water
and
now
and
then
the
yellow
neck
and
shoulder
as
he
forged
forward
in
the
desperate
struggle
for
life
strange
tableau
it
was
and
bore
strong
resemblance
to
a
when
the
stag
takes
to
the
water
and
the
hounds
in
full
cry
plunge
boldly
after
but
in
this
chase
were
the
elements
of
a
still
grander
excitement
both
the
quarry
and
the
pack
were
human
not
all
human
there
were
dogs
as
well
hounds
and
mastiffs
mingled
among
the
men
side
by
side
with
their
masters
in
the
eager
purpose
of
pursuit
a
strange
tableau
indeed
stray
shots
were
still
fired
from
the
shore
rifles
had
been
reloaded
by
those
who
remained
and
now
and
then
the
plash
of
the
tiny
pellet
could
be
seen
where
it
struck
the
water
far
short
of
the
distant
swimmer
he
needed
no
longer
have
a
dread
of
danger
from
that
source
he
was
beyond
the
range
of
the
rifles
the
whole
scene
had
the
semblance
of
a
dream
so
sudden
had
been
the
change
of
events
i
could
scarcely
give
credit
to
my
senses
and
believe
it
a
reality
but
the
moment
before
the
criminal
lay
bound
and
helpless
beside
him
the
pile
upon
which
he
was
to
be
burnt
now
was
he
swimming
far
and
free
his
executioners
a
hopeless
distance
behind
him
rapid
had
been
the
transformation
it
hardly
appeared
real
nevertheless
it
real
it
was
before
the
eyes
a
long
time
too
before
our
eyes
a
chase
in
the
water
is
a
very
different
affair
from
a
pursuit
on
dry
land
and
notwithstanding
there
was
life
and
death
on
the
issue
slow
was
the
progress
both
of
pursuers
and
pursued
for
nearly
half
an
hour
we
who
remained
upon
the
shore
continued
spectators
of
this
singular
contest
the
frenzy
of
the
first
moments
had
passed
away
but
there
was
sufficient
interest
to
sustain
a
strong
excitement
to
the
last
and
some
continued
to
shout
and
gesticulate
though
neither
their
cries
nor
actions
could
in
anywise
influence
the
result
no
words
of
encouragement
could
have
increased
the
speed
of
the
pursuers
no
threats
were
needed
to
urge
forward
the
fugitive
we
who
remained
inactive
had
time
enough
to
reflect
and
upon
reflection
it
became
apparent
why
the
runaway
had
taken
to
the
water
had
he
attempted
to
escape
by
the
fields
he
would
have
been
pulled
down
by
the
dogs
or
else
overtaken
by
swift
runners
for
there
were
many
swifter
than
he
there
were
few
better
swimmers
however
and
he
knew
it
for
this
reason
then
had
he
preferred
the
water
to
the
woods
and
certainly
his
chances
of
escape
seemed
better
after
all
he
could
escape
the
island
for
which
he
was
making
was
about
half
a
mile
from
the
shore
but
beyond
was
a
stretch
of
clear
water
of
more
than
a
mile
in
width
he
would
arrive
at
the
island
before
any
of
his
pursuers
but
what
then
did
he
purpose
to
remain
there
in
hopes
of
concealing
himself
among
the
bushes
its
surface
of
several
acres
was
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
large
trees
some
stood
close
by
the
shore
their
branches
draped
with
silvery
tillandsia
overhanging
the
water
but
what
of
this
there
might
have
been
cover
enough
to
have
given
shelter
to
a
bear
or
a
hunted
wolf
but
not
to
a
hunted
man
not
to
a
slave
who
had
drawn
the
knife
upon
his
master
no
no
every
inch
of
the
thicket
would
be
searched
to
escape
by
concealing
himself
he
might
not
perhaps
he
only
meant
to
use
the
island
as
a
and
after
breathing
himself
take
once
more
to
the
water
and
swim
for
the
opposite
shore
it
was
possible
for
a
strong
swimmer
to
reach
it
but
it
would
not
be
possible
for
there
were
skiffs
and
upon
the
river
both
up
and
down
men
had
already
gone
after
them
and
long
before
he
could
work
his
way
across
that
wide
reach
keels
would
be
cutting
after
him
no
no
he
could
not
escape
either
upon
the
island
or
in
the
water
beyond
he
would
be
captured
thus
reasoned
the
spectators
as
they
stood
watching
the
pursuit
the
excitement
rose
higher
as
the
swimmers
neared
the
island
it
is
always
so
at
the
approach
of
a
crisis
and
a
crisis
was
near
though
not
such
a
one
as
the
spectators
anticipated
they
looked
to
see
the
runaway
reach
the
island
mount
up
the
bank
and
disappear
among
the
trees
they
looked
to
see
his
pursuers
climb
out
close
upon
his
heels
and
perhaps
hear
of
his
capture
before
he
could
cross
through
the
timber
and
take
to
the
water
on
the
other
side
some
such
crisis
were
they
expecting
and
it
could
not
be
distant
for
the
mulatto
was
now
close
into
the
edge
of
the
island
a
few
strokes
would
bring
him
to
the
shore
he
was
swimming
under
the
black
shadows
of
the
trees
it
seemed
as
if
the
branches
were
over
his
head
as
if
he
might
have
thrown
up
his
hands
and
clutched
them
the
main
body
of
his
pursuers
was
still
fifty
yards
in
his
rear
but
some
who
had
forged
ahead
of
the
rest
were
within
half
that
distance
from
where
we
viewed
them
they
seemed
far
nearer
in
fact
it
was
easy
to
fancy
that
they
were
swimming
alongside
and
could
have
laid
hands
on
him
at
any
moment
the
crisis
was
approaching
but
not
that
which
was
looked
for
the
pursuit
was
destined
to
a
far
different
ending
from
that
anticipated
either
by
spectators
or
pursuers
the
pursued
himself
little
dreamed
of
the
doom
that
was
so
near
a
doom
awfully
appropriate
the
swimmer
was
cleaving
his
way
across
the
belt
of
black
shadow
we
expected
next
moment
to
see
him
enter
among
the
trees
when
all
at
once
he
was
seen
to
turn
side
towards
us
and
direct
his
course
along
the
edge
of
the
island
we
observed
this
manoeuvre
with
some
astonishment
we
could
not
account
for
it
it
was
clearly
to
the
advantage
of
his
pursuers
who
now
swam
in
a
diagonal
line
to
intercept
him
what
could
be
his
motive
had
he
failed
to
find
a
even
so
he
might
have
clutched
the
branches
and
by
that
means
drawn
himself
ashore
ha
our
conjectures
are
answered
yonder
is
the
answer
yonder
brown
log
that
floats
on
the
black
water
is
the
trunk
of
a
dead
tree
it
is
not
dead
it
has
life
and
motion
see
it
assumes
a
form
the
form
of
the
great
saurian
the
hideous
alligator
its
gaunt
jaws
are
thrown
up
its
scolloped
tail
is
erect
its
breast
alone
rests
upon
the
water
on
this
as
a
pivot
it
spins
round
and
round
brandishing
its
tail
in
the
air
and
at
intervals
lashing
the
spray
aloft
its
bellowing
is
echoed
back
from
the
distant
shores
the
lake
vibrates
under
the
hoarse
baritone
the
flutter
and
cry
and
the
white
crane
mounts
screaming
into
the
air
the
spectators
stand
aghast
the
pursuers
have
poised
themselves
in
the
water
and
advance
no
farther
one
solitary
swimmer
is
seen
struggling
on
it
is
he
who
swims
for
his
life
it
is
upon
him
the
eyes
of
the
alligator
are
fixed
why
upon
him
more
than
the
others
they
are
all
equally
near
is
it
the
hand
of
god
who
takes
vengeance
another
revolution
another
sweep
of
its
strong
tail
and
the
huge
reptile
rushes
upon
its
victim
i
have
forgotten
his
crimes
i
almost
sympathise
with
him
is
there
no
hope
of
his
escape
see
he
has
grasped
the
branch
of
a
he
is
endeavouring
to
lift
himself
up
above
the
water
above
the
danger
heaven
strengthen
his
arms
ah
he
will
be
too
late
already
the
jaws
that
crash
the
branch
has
broken
he
sinks
back
to
the
surface
below
it
he
is
out
of
sight
he
has
gone
to
the
bottom
and
after
him
and
eager
darts
the
gigantic
lizard
both
have
disappeared
from
our
view
the
froth
floats
like
a
blanket
upon
the
waves
clouting
the
leaves
on
the
broken
branch
we
watch
with
eager
eyes
not
a
ripple
escapes
unnoted
but
no
new
movement
stirs
the
surface
no
motion
is
observed
no
form
comes
up
and
the
waves
soon
flatten
over
the
spot
beyond
a
doubt
the
reptile
has
finished
its
work
whose
work
was
it
the
hand
of
god
who
took
vengeance
so
they
are
saying
round
me
the
pursuers
have
faced
back
and
are
swimming
towards
us
none
cares
to
trust
himself
under
the
black
shadows
of
those
island
oaks
they
will
have
a
long
swim
before
they
can
reach
the
shore
and
some
of
them
will
scarcely
accomplish
it
they
are
in
danger
but
no
yonder
come
the
skiffs
and
pirogues
that
will
soon
pick
them
up
they
have
seen
the
boats
and
swim
slowly
or
float
upon
the
water
waiting
their
approach
they
are
taken
in
one
after
another
and
all
both
dogs
and
men
are
now
carried
to
the
island
they
go
to
continue
the
search
for
there
is
still
some
doubt
as
to
the
fate
of
the
runaway
they
land
the
dogs
are
sent
through
the
bushes
while
the
men
glide
round
the
edge
to
the
scene
of
the
struggle
they
find
no
track
or
trace
upon
the
shore
but
there
is
one
upon
the
water
some
froth
still
floats
there
is
a
tinge
of
carmine
upon
it
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
the
blood
of
the
mulatto

that
blueskin

the

is
received
with
shouts
of

a
spirit
talked
the
as
they
returned
from
the
chase
chapter
fourteen
ringgold
revenge
only
the
ruder
spirits
indulged
in
this
levity
others
of
more
refined
nature
regarded
the
incident
with
due
solemnity
some
even
with
a
feeling
of
awe
certainly
it
seemed
as
if
the
hand
of
god
had
interposed
so
appropriate
had
been
the
punishment
almost
as
if
the
criminal
had
perished
by
his
own
contrivance
it
was
an
awful
death
but
far
less
hard
to
endure
than
that
which
had
been
decreed
by
man
the
almighty
had
been
more
merciful
and
in
thus
mitigating
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
wretch
had
rebuked
his
human
judges
i
looked
around
for
the
young
indian
i
was
gratified
to
find
he
was
no
longer
among
the
crowd
his
quarrel
with
ringgold
had
been
broken
off
abruptly
i
had
fears
that
it
was
not
yet
ended
his
words
had
irritated
some
of
the
white
men
and
it
was
through
his
being
there
the
criminal
had
found
the
opportunity
to
get
off
no
doubt
had
the
latter
finally
escaped
there
would
have
been
more
of
it
and
even
as
matters
stood
i
was
not
without
apprehensions
about
the
safety
of
the
bold
he
was
not
upon
his
own
ground
the
other
side
of
the
river
was
the
indian
territory
and
therefore
he
might
be
deemed
an
intruder
true
we
were
at
peace
with
the
indians
but
for
all
that
there
was
enough
of
hostile
feeling
between
the
two
races
old
wounds
received
in
the
war
of
still
rankled
i
knew
ringgold
resentful
character
he
had
been
humiliated
in
the
eyes
of
his
companions
for
during
the
short
scuffle
the
had
the
best
of
it
ringgold
would
not
be
content
to
let
it
drop
he
would
seek
revenge
i
was
glad
therefore
on
perceiving
that
the
indian
had
gone
away
from
the
ground
perhaps
he
had
himself
become
apprehensive
of
danger
and
recrossed
the
river
there
he
would
be
safe
from
pursuit
even
ringgold
dare
not
follow
him
to
the
other
side
for
the
treaty
laws
could
not
have
been
outraged
with
impunity
the
most
reckless
of
the
squatters
knew
this
an
indian
war
would
have
been
provoked
and
the
supreme
government
though
not
over
scrupulous
had
other
views
at
the
time
i
was
turning
to
proceed
homeward
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
accost
ringgold
and
signify
to
him
my
disapproval
of
his
conduct
i
was
indignant
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
acted
just
angry
enough
to
speak
my
mind
ringgold
was
older
than
myself
and
bigger
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
him
on
the
contrary
i
knew
that
he
was
rather
afraid
of
the
insult
he
had
offered
to
one
who
but
the
hour
before
had
risked
his
life
for
us
had
sufficiently
roused
my
blood
and
i
was
determined
to
reproach
him
for
it
with
this
intention
i
turned
back
to
look
for
him
he
was
not
there
have
you
seen
arens
ringgold
i
inquired
of
old
hickman
yes
jest
gone
was
the
reply
in
what
direction
see
gallop
off
wi
bill
williams
an
ned
spence
desprit
keen
upon
somethin
they
a
painful
suspicion
flashed
across
my
mind
hickman
i
asked
will
you
lend
me
your
horse
for
an
hour
my
old
critter
sartin
sure
will
i
a
day
if
you
wants
him
but
geordy
boy
you
ca
ride
wi
your
arm
that
way
o
yes
only
help
me
into
the
saddle
the
old
hunter
did
as
desired
and
after
exchanging
another
word
or
two
i
rode
off
in
the
direction
up
the
river
was
a
ferry
and
at
its
landing
it
was
most
likely
the
young
indian
had
left
his
canoe
in
that
direction
therefore
he
should
go
to
get
back
to
his
home
and
in
that
direction
ringgold
should
go
to
return
to
his
for
the
path
to
the
ringgold
plantation
led
in
a
course
altogether
opposite
hence
the
suspicion
that
occurred
to
me
on
hearing
that
the
latter
had
gone
up
the
river
at
such
a
time
it
did
not
look
well
and
in
such
company
still
worse
for
i
recognised
in
the
names
that
hickman
had
mentioned
two
of
the
most
worthless
boys
in
the
settlement
i
knew
them
to
be
associates
or
rather
creatures
of
ringgold
my
suspicion
was
that
they
had
gone
after
the
indian
and
of
course
with
an
ill
intent
it
was
hardly
a
conjecture
i
was
almost
sure
of
it
and
as
i
advanced
along
the
river
road
i
became
confirmed
in
the
belief
i
saw
the
tracks
of
their
horses
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
ferry
and
now
and
again
i
could
make
out
the
print
of
the
indian
moccasin
where
it
left
its
wet
mark
in
the
dust
i
knew
that
his
dress
had
not
yet
dried
upon
him
and
the
moccasins
would
still
be
saturated
with
water
i
put
the
old
horse
to
his
speed
as
i
approached
the
landing
i
could
see
no
one
for
there
were
trees
all
around
it
but
the
conflict
of
angry
voices
proved
that
i
had
conjectured
aright
i
did
not
stop
to
listen
but
urging
my
horse
afresh
i
rode
on
at
a
bend
of
the
road
i
saw
three
horses
tied
to
the
trees
i
knew
they
were
those
of
ringgold
and
his
companions
but
i
could
not
tell
why
they
had
left
them
i
stayed
not
to
speculate
but
galloped
forward
upon
the
ground
just
as
i
had
anticipated
the
three
were
there
the
was
in
their
hands
they
had
crept
upon
him
unawares
that
was
why
their
horses
had
been
left
behind
and
caught
him
just
as
he
was
about
stepping
into
his
canoe
he
was
unarmed
for
the
rifle
i
had
given
him
was
still
wet
and
the
mulatto
had
made
away
with
his
knife
he
could
offer
no
resistance
and
was
therefore
secured
at
once
they
had
been
quick
about
it
for
they
had
already
stripped
off
his
and
tied
him
to
a
tree
they
were
just
about
to
vent
their
spite
on
him
by
flogging
him
on
the
bare
back
with
cowhides
which
they
carried
in
their
hands
no
doubt
they
would
have
laid
them
on
heavily
had
i
not
arrived
in
time
shame
arens
ringgold
shame
i
cried
as
i
rode
up
this
is
cowardly
and
i
shall
report
it
to
the
whole
settlement
ringgold
stammered
out
some
excuse
but
was
evidently
staggered
at
my
sudden
appearance
the
darned
injun
desarves
it
growled
williams
for
what
master
williams
i
inquired
for
waggin
his
jaw
so
imperent
to
white
men
he
got
no
business
over
here
chimed
in
spence
he
has
got
no
right
to
come
this
side
of
the
river
and
you
have
no
right
to
flog
him
whether
on
this
side
or
the
other
no
more
than
you
have
to
flog
me
ho
ho
that
might
be
done
too
said
spence
in
a
sneering
tone
that
set
my
blood
in
a
boil
not
so
easily
i
cried
leaping
from
the
old
horse
and
running
forward
upon
the
ground
my
right
arm
was
still
sound
apprehensive
of
an
awkward
affair
i
had
borrowed
old
hickman
pistol
and
i
held
it
in
my
hand
now
gentlemen
said
i
taking
my
stand
beside
the
captive
go
on
with
the
flogging
but
take
my
word
for
it
i
shall
send
a
bullet
through
the
first
who
strikes
though
they
were
but
boys
all
three
were
armed
with
knife
and
pistol
as
was
the
custom
of
the
time
of
the
three
spence
seemed
most
inclined
to
carry
out
his
threat
but
he
and
williams
saw
that
ringgold
their
leader
had
already
backed
out
for
the
latter
had
something
to
lose
which
his
companions
had
not
besides
he
had
other
thoughts
as
well
as
fears
for
his
personal
safety
the
result
was
that
all
three
after
remonstrating
with
me
for
my
interference
a
quarrel
that
did
not
concern
made
an
angry
and
somewhat
awkward
exit
from
the
scene
the
young
indian
was
soon
released
from
his
unpleasant
situation
he
uttered
few
words
but
his
looks
amply
expressed
his
gratitude
as
he
pressed
my
hand
at
parting
he
said
come
to
the
other
side
to
hunt
whenever
you
please
no
indian
will
harm
you
in
the
land
of
the
red
men
will
be
welcome
chapter
fifteen
maumee
an
acquaintance
thus
acquired
could
not
be
lightly
dropped
should
it
end
otherwise
than
in
friendship
this
was
a
noble
youth
the
germ
of
a
gentleman
i
resolved
to
accept
his
invitation
and
visit
him
in
his
forest
home
his
mother
he
said
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
not
far
off
i
should
find
it
on
the
bank
of
a
little
stream
that
emptied
into
the
main
river
above
where
the
latter
expands
itself
i
felt
a
secret
gratification
as
i
listened
to
these
directions
i
knew
the
stream
of
which
he
was
speaking
lately
i
had
sailed
up
it
in
my
skiff
it
was
upon
its
banks
i
had
seen
that
fair
vision
the
whose
beauty
haunted
my
imagination
was
it
maumee
i
longed
to
be
satisfied
i
waited
only
for
the
healing
of
my
wound
till
my
arm
should
be
strong
enough
for
the
oar
i
chafed
at
the
delay
but
time
passed
and
i
was
well
i
chose
a
beautiful
morning
for
the
promised
visit
and
was
prepared
to
start
forth
i
had
no
companion
only
my
dogs
and
gun
i
had
reached
my
skiff
and
was
about
stepping
in
when
a
voice
accosted
me
on
turning
i
beheld
my
sister
poor
little
virgine
she
had
lost
somewhat
of
her
habitual
gaiety
and
appeared
much
changed
of
late
she
was
not
yet
over
the
terrible
fright
its
consequences
were
apparent
in
her
more
thoughtful
demeanour
whither
goest
thou
georgy
she
inquired
as
she
came
near
must
i
tell
virgine
either
that
or
take
me
with
you
what
to
the
woods
and
why
not
i
long
for
a
ramble
in
the
woods
wicked
brother
you
never
indulge
me
why
sister
you
never
asked
me
before
even
so
you
might
know
that
i
desired
it
who
would
not
wish
to
go
wandering
in
the
woods
oh
i
wish
i
were
a
wild
bird
or
a
butterfly
or
some
other
creature
with
wings
i
should
wander
all
over
those
beautiful
woods
without
asking
you
to
guide
me
selfish
brother
any
other
day
virgine
but
why
but
why
not
this
very
day
surely
it
is
fine
it
is
lovely
the
truth
then
sister
i
am
not
exactly
bound
for
the
woods
and
whither
bound
whither
bound
georgy
that
what
they
say
in
ships
i
am
going
to
visit
young
powell
at
his
mother
cabin
i
promised
him
i
should
ha
exclaimed
my
sister
suddenly
changing
colour
and
remaining
for
a
moment
in
a
reflective
attitude
the
name
had
recalled
that
horrid
scene
i
was
sorry
i
had
mentioned
it
now
brother
continued
she
after
a
pause
there
is
nothing
i
more
desire
to
see
than
an
indian
cabin
you
know
i
have
never
seen
one
good
georgy
good
georgy
pray
take
me
along
with
you
there
was
an
earnestness
in
the
appeal
i
could
not
resist
though
i
would
rather
have
gone
alone
i
had
a
secret
that
i
would
not
have
trusted
even
to
my
fond
sister
i
had
an
indefinite
feeling
besides
that
i
ought
not
to
take
her
with
me
so
far
from
home
into
a
part
of
the
country
with
which
i
was
so
little
acquainted
she
appealed
a
second
time
if
mother
will
give
her
consent
nonsense
georgy
mamma
will
not
be
angry
why
return
to
the
house
you
see
i
am
prepared
i
have
my
we
can
be
back
before
we
are
missed
you
told
me
it
was
not
far
step
in
sis
sit
down
in
the
stern
there
yo
ho
we
are
off
there
was
not
much
strength
in
the
current
and
half
an
hour
rowing
brought
the
skiff
to
the
mouth
of
the
creek
we
entered
it
and
continued
upward
it
was
a
narrow
stream
but
sufficiently
deep
to
float
either
skiff
or
canoe
the
sun
was
hot
but
his
beams
could
not
reach
us
they
were
intercepted
by
the
tupelo
trees
that
grew
upon
the
banks
their
leafy
branches
almost
meeting
across
the
water
half
a
mile
from
the
mouth
of
the
creek
we
approached
a
clearing
we
saw
fields
under
cultivation
we
noticed
crops
of
maize
and
sweet
potatoes
with
capsicums
melons
and
calabashes
there
was
a
of
considerable
size
near
the
bank
surrounded
by
an
enclosure
with
smaller
houses
in
the
rear
it
was
a
log
structure
somewhat
antique
in
its
appearance
with
a
portico
the
pillars
of
which
exhibited
a
rude
carving
there
were
slaves
at
work
in
the
field
that
is
there
were
black
men
and
some
red
men
too
indians
it
could
not
be
the
plantation
of
a
white
man
there
were
none
on
that
side
the
river
some
wealthy
indian
we
conjectured
who
is
the
owner
of
land
and
slaves
we
were
not
surprised
at
this
we
knew
there
were
many
such
but
where
was
the
cabin
of
our
friend
he
had
told
me
it
stood
upon
the
bank
of
the
stream
not
more
than
half
a
mile
from
its
mouth
had
we
passed
without
seeing
it
or
was
it
still
higher
up
shall
we
stop
and
inquire
virgine
who
is
it
standing
in
the
porch
ha
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
sis
it
is
the
young
indian
himself
surely
he
does
not
live
that
is
not
a
cabin
perhaps
he
is
on
a
visit
but
see
he
is
coming
this
way
as
i
spoke
the
indian
stepped
out
from
the
house
and
walked
rapidly
towards
us
in
a
few
seconds
he
stood
upon
the
bank
and
beckoned
us
to
a
landing
as
when
seen
before
he
was
gaily
dressed
with
plumed
toque
upon
his
head
and
garments
richly
embroidered
as
he
stood
upon
the
bank
above
us
his
fine
form
outlined
against
the
sky
he
presented
the
appearance
of
a
miniature
warrior
though
but
a
boy
he
looked
splendid
and
picturesque
i
almost
envied
him
his
wild
attire
my
sister
seemed
to
look
on
him
with
admiration
though
i
thought
i
could
trace
some
terror
in
her
glance
from
the
manner
in
which
her
colour
came
and
went
i
fancied
that
his
presence
recalled
that
scene
and
again
i
regretted
that
she
had
accompanied
me
he
appeared
unembarrassed
by
our
arrival
i
have
known
it
otherwise
among
whites
and
those
too
making
pretensions
to
this
young
indian
was
as
cool
and
collected
as
though
he
had
been
expecting
us
which
he
was
not
he
could
not
have
expected
both
there
was
no
show
of
coldness
in
our
reception
as
soon
as
we
approached
near
enough
he
caught
the
stem
of
the
skiff
drew
her
close
up
to
the
landing
and
with
the
politeness
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
assisted
us
to
debark
you
are
welcome
said
he
welcome
and
then
turning
to
virginia
with
an
inquiring
look
he
added
i
hope
the
health
of
the
senorita
is
quite
restored
as
for
yours
sir
i
need
not
inquire
that
you
have
rowed
your
skiff
so
far
against
the
current
is
a
proof
you
have
got
over
your
mishap
the
word
senorita
betrayed
a
trace
of
the
spaniards
a
remnant
of
those
relations
that
had
erewhile
existed
between
the
seminole
indians
and
the
iberian
race
even
in
the
costume
of
our
new
acquaintance
could
be
observed
objects
of
andalusian
origin
the
silver
cross
hanging
from
his
neck
the
sash
of
scarlet
silk
around
his
waist
and
the
bright
triangular
blade
that
was
sheathed
behind
it
the
scene
too
had
spanish
touches
there
were
exotic
plants
the
china
orange
the
splendid
papaya
the
capsicums
chiles
and
tomatoes
almost
characteristics
of
the
home
of
the
spanish
colonist
the
house
itself
exhibited
traces
of
castilian
workmanship
the
carving
was
not
indian
is
this
your
home
i
inquired
with
a
little
embarrassment
he
had
bid
us
welcome
but
i
saw
no
cabin
i
might
be
wrong
his
answer
set
me
at
rest
it
was
his
home
his
mother
house
his
father
was
long
since
dead
there
were
but
the
three
his
mother
his
sister
himself
and
these
i
inquired
pointing
to
the
labourers
our
slaves
he
replied
with
a
smile
you
perceive
we
indians
are
getting
into
the
customs
of
civilisation
but
these
are
not
all
negroes
there
are
red
men
are
slaves
slaves
like
the
others
i
see
you
are
astonished
they
are
not
of
our
tribe
they
are
our
people
conquered
them
long
ago
and
many
of
them
still
remain
slaves
we
had
arrived
at
the
house
his
mother
met
us
by
the
door
a
woman
of
pure
indian
race
who
had
evidently
once
possessed
beauty
she
was
still
agreeable
to
look
upon
though
in
indian
costume
maternal
intelligent
we
entered
furniture
trophies
of
the
chase
horse
accoutrements
in
the
spanish
style
a
guitar
ha
books
my
sister
and
i
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
under
an
indian
roof
these
symbols
of
civilisation
ah
cried
the
youth
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
himself
i
am
glad
you
are
come
your
moccasins
are
finished
where
are
they
mother
where
is
she
where
is
maumee
he
had
given
words
to
my
thoughts
their
very
echo
who
is
maumee
whispered
virgine
an
indian
girl
his
sister
i
believe
yonder
she
comes
a
foot
scarce
a
span
in
length
an
ankle
that
from
the
broidered
flap
of
the
moccasin
exhibits
two
lines
widely
diverging
upward
a
waist
of
that
pleasing
flexure
that
sweeps
abruptly
inward
and
out
again
a
bosom
whose
prominence
could
be
detected
under
the
coarsest
draping
a
face
of
rich
golden
brown
skin
diaphanous
cheeks
coral
red
lips
of
like
hue
dark
eyes
and
brows
long
crescent
lashes
hair
of
deepest
black
in
wantonness
of
profusion
fancy
such
a
form
fancy
it
robed
in
all
the
picturesque
finery
that
indian
ingenuity
can
devise
fancy
it
approaching
you
with
a
step
that
rivals
the
steed
of
arabia
and
you
may
fancy
no
you
may
not
fancy
maumee
my
poor
heart
it
was
she
my
i
could
have
tarried
long
under
the
roof
of
that
hospitable
home
but
my
sister
seemed
ill
at
ease
as
if
there
came
always
recurring
to
her
the
memory
of
that
unhappy
adventure
we
stayed
but
an
hour
it
seemed
not
half
so
long
but
short
as
was
the
time
it
transformed
me
into
a
man
as
i
rowed
back
home
i
felt
that
my
boy
heart
had
been
left
behind
me
chapter
sixteen
the
island
i
longed
to
revisit
the
indian
home
and
was
not
slow
to
gratify
my
wish
there
was
no
restraint
upon
my
actions
neither
father
nor
mother
interfered
with
my
daily
wanderings
i
came
and
went
at
will
and
was
rarely
questioned
as
to
the
direction
i
had
taken
hunting
was
supposed
to
be
the
purpose
of
my
absence
my
dogs
and
gun
which
i
always
took
with
me
and
the
game
i
usually
brought
back
answered
all
curiosity
my
hunting
excursions
were
always
in
one
direction
i
need
hardly
have
said
so
always
across
the
river
again
and
again
did
the
keel
of
my
skiff
cleave
the
waters
of
the
creek
again
and
again
till
i
knew
every
tree
upon
its
banks
my
acquaintance
with
young
powell
soon
ripened
into
a
firm
friendship
almost
daily
were
we
together
either
upon
the
lake
or
in
the
woods
companions
in
the
chase
and
many
a
deer
and
wild
turkey
did
we
slaughter
in
concert
the
indian
boy
was
already
a
skilled
hunter
and
i
learned
many
a
secret
of
woodcraft
in
his
company
i
well
remember
that
hunting
less
delighted
me
than
before
i
preferred
that
hour
when
the
chase
was
over
and
i
halted
at
the
indian
house
on
my
way
home
when
i
drank
the
out
of
the
carved
calabash
far
sweeter
from
the
hands
out
of
which
i
received
the
cup
far
sweeter
from
the
smiles
of
her
who
gave
it
maumee
for
weeks
short
weeks
they
seemed
i
revelled
in
this
young
dream
of
love
ah
it
is
true
there
is
no
joy
in
afterlife
that
equals
this
glory
and
power
are
but
gratifications
love
alone
is
bliss
purest
and
sweetest
in
its
virgin
bloom
often
was
virginia
my
companion
in
these
wild
wood
excursions
she
had
grown
fond
of
the
forest
she
said
so
and
willingly
went
along
there
were
times
when
i
should
have
preferred
going
alone
but
i
could
not
gainsay
her
she
had
become
attached
to
maumee
i
did
not
wonder
maumee
too
liked
my
sister
not
from
any
resemblance
of
character
physically
they
were
unlike
as
two
young
girls
could
well
be
virginia
was
all
blonde
and
gold
maumee
damask
and
dark
intellectually
they
approached
no
nearer
the
former
was
timid
as
the
dove
the
latter
possessed
a
spirit
bold
as
the
falcon
perhaps
the
contrast
drew
closer
the
ties
of
friendship
that
had
sprung
up
between
them
it
is
not
an
anomaly
far
more
like
an
anomaly
was
my
feeling
in
relation
to
the
two
i
loved
my
sister
for
the
very
softness
of
her
nature
i
loved
maumee
for
the
opposite
but
true
these
loves
were
very
distinct
in
kind
unlike
as
the
objects
that
called
them
forth
while
young
powell
and
i
hunted
our
sisters
stayed
at
home
they
strolled
about
the
fields
the
groves
the
garden
they
played
and
sang
and
for
maumee
despite
her
costume
was
no
savage
she
had
books
a
guitar
or
rather
a
bandolin
a
spanish
relic
and
had
been
instructed
in
both
so
far
as
mental
cultivation
went
she
was
fit
society
even
for
the
daughter
of
a
proud
randolph
young
powell
too
was
as
well
or
better
educated
than
myself
their
father
had
not
neglected
his
duty
neither
virginia
nor
i
ever
dreamed
of
an
inequality
the
association
was
by
us
desired
and
sought
we
were
both
too
young
to
know
aught
of
in
our
friendships
we
followed
only
the
prompting
of
innocent
nature
and
it
never
occurred
to
us
that
we
were
going
astray
the
girls
frequently
accompanied
us
into
the
forest
and
to
this
we
the
hunters
made
no
objection
we
did
not
always
go
in
quest
of
the
stag
squirrels
and
other
small
game
were
oftener
the
objects
of
our
pursuit
and
in
following
these
we
needed
not
to
stray
far
from
our
delicate
companions
as
for
maumee
she
was
a
huntress
a
bold
equestrian
and
could
have
ridden
in
the
drive
as
yet
my
sister
had
scarcely
been
on
horseback
i
grew
to
like
the
the
best
my
dogs
were
often
left
behind
and
it
became
a
rare
thing
for
me
to
bring
home
venison
our
excursions
were
not
confined
to
the
woods
the
upon
the
lake
the
ibises
egrets
and
white
cranes
were
often
the
victims
of
our
hunting
ardour
in
the
lake
there
was
a
beautiful
island
not
that
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
but
one
higher
up
near
the
widening
of
the
river
its
surface
was
of
large
extent
and
rose
to
a
summit
in
the
centre
for
the
most
part
it
was
clad
with
timber
nearly
all
evergreen
as
the
magnolia
illicium
and
the
wild
orage
indigenous
to
florida
there
was
zanthoxylon
trees
with
their
conspicuous
yellow
blossoms
the
perfumed
flowering
dogwood
and
plants
and
shrubs
the
princely
palm
towering
high
over
all
and
forming
with
its
umbels
a
double
canopy
of
verdure
the
timber
though
standing
thickly
did
not
form
a
thicket
here
and
there
the
path
was
tangled
with
epiphytes
or
parasites
with
enormous
gnarled
vines
of
the
with
bignonias
with
china
and
sarsaparilla
briers
with
bromilias
and
orchids
but
the
larger
trees
stood
well
apart
and
at
intervals
there
were
openings
pretty
glades
carpeted
with
grass
and
enamelled
with
flowers
the
fair
island
lay
about
between
the
two
homes
and
often
young
powell
and
i
met
upon
it
and
made
it
the
scene
of
our
sport
there
were
squirrels
among
the
trees
and
turkeys
sometimes
deer
were
found
in
the
glades
and
from
its
covered
shores
we
could
do
execution
among
the
that
sported
upon
the
lake
several
times
had
we
met
on
this
neutral
ground
and
always
accompanied
by
our
sisters
both
delighted
in
the
lovely
spot
they
used
to
ascend
the
slope
and
seat
themselves
under
the
shade
of
some
tall
palms
that
grew
on
the
summit
while
we
the
hunters
remained
in
the
ground
below
causing
the
woods
to
ring
with
the
reports
of
our
rifles
then
it
was
our
custom
when
satiated
with
the
sport
also
to
ascend
the
hill
and
deliver
up
our
spoils
particularly
when
we
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
procure
some
rare
and
richly
plumed
bird
an
object
of
curiosity
or
admiration
for
my
part
whether
successful
or
not
i
always
left
off
sooner
than
my
companion
i
was
not
so
keen
a
hunter
as
he
i
far
more
delighted
to
recline
along
the
grass
where
the
two
maidens
were
seated
far
sweeter
than
the
sound
of
the
rifle
was
it
to
listen
to
the
tones
of
voice
far
fairer
than
the
sight
of
game
was
it
to
gaze
into
the
eyes
of
maumee
and
beyond
this
beyond
listening
and
looking
my
love
had
never
gone
no
had
ever
passed
between
us
i
even
knew
not
whether
i
was
beloved
my
hours
were
not
all
blissful
the
sky
was
not
always
of
rose
colour
the
doubts
that
my
youthful
passion
was
returned
were
its
clouds
and
these
often
arose
to
trouble
me
about
this
time
i
became
unhappy
from
another
cause
i
perceived
or
fancied
that
virginia
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
brother
of
maumee
and
that
this
was
reciprocated
the
thought
gave
me
surprise
and
pain
yet
why
i
should
have
experienced
either
i
could
not
tell
i
have
said
that
my
sister
and
i
were
too
young
to
know
ought
of
the
prejudices
of
rank
or
caste
but
this
was
not
strictly
true
i
must
have
had
some
instinct
that
in
this
free
association
with
our
neighbours
we
were
doing
wrong
else
how
could
it
have
made
me
unhappy
i
fancied
that
virginia
shared
this
feeling
with
me
we
were
both
ill
at
ease
and
yet
we
were
not
confidants
of
each
other
i
dreaded
to
make
known
my
thoughts
even
to
my
sister
and
she
no
doubt
felt
a
like
reluctance
to
the
disclosing
of
her
secret
what
would
be
the
result
of
these
young
loves
if
left
to
themselves
would
they
in
due
time
die
out
would
there
arrive
an
hour
of
satiety
and
change
or
without
interruption
would
they
become
perpetual
who
knows
what
might
be
their
fate
if
permitted
to
advance
to
perfect
development
but
it
is
never
so
they
are
always
interrupted
so
were
ours
the
crisis
came
and
the
sweet
companionship
in
which
we
had
been
indulging
was
brought
to
a
sudden
close
we
had
never
disclosed
it
to
our
father
or
mother
though
we
had
used
no
craft
to
conceal
it
we
had
not
been
questioned
else
should
we
certainly
have
avowed
it
for
we
had
been
taught
strictly
to
regard
truth
but
no
questions
had
been
asked
no
surprise
had
been
expressed
at
our
frequent
absences
mine
as
a
hunter
were
but
natural
the
only
wonderment
was
that
virginia
had
grown
so
found
of
the
forest
and
so
often
bore
me
company
but
this
slight
surprise
on
the
part
of
my
mother
soon
wore
off
and
we
went
freely
forth
and
as
freely
returned
without
challenge
of
our
motives
i
have
said
that
we
used
no
art
to
conceal
who
were
our
associates
in
these
wild
wanderings
that
again
is
not
strictly
true
our
very
silence
was
craft
we
must
both
have
had
some
secret
perception
that
we
were
acting
wrongly
that
our
conduct
would
not
meet
the
approval
of
our
parents
else
why
should
we
have
cared
for
concealment
it
was
destined
that
this
repose
should
not
be
of
long
continuance
it
ended
abruptly
somewhat
harshly
one
day
we
were
upon
the
island
all
four
as
usual
the
hunt
was
over
and
powell
and
i
had
rejoined
our
sisters
upon
the
hill
we
had
stretched
ourselves
under
the
shade
and
were
indulging
in
trivial
conversation
but
i
far
more
in
the
mute
language
of
love
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
object
of
my
thoughts
too
happy
that
my
glances
were
returned
i
saw
little
besides
i
did
not
notice
that
there
was
a
similar
exchange
of
ardent
looks
between
the
young
indian
and
my
sister
at
that
moment
i
cared
not
i
was
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
smiles
of
maumee
there
were
those
who
did
observe
the
exchange
of
glances
who
saw
all
that
was
passing
anxious
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
tableau
formed
by
the
four
of
us
and
our
words
looks
and
gestures
were
noted
the
dogs
rose
with
a
growl
and
ran
outward
among
the
trees
the
rustling
branches
and
garments
shining
through
the
foliage
warned
us
that
there
were
people
there
the
dogs
had
ceased
to
give
tongue
and
were
wagging
their
tails
they
were
friends
then
who
were
near
the
leaves
sheltered
them
no
longer
from
our
view
behold
my
father
my
mother
virginia
and
i
were
startled
by
their
appearance
we
felt
some
apprehension
of
evil
arising
no
doubt
from
our
own
convictions
that
we
had
not
been
acting
aright
we
observed
that
the
brows
of
both
were
clouded
they
appeared
vexed
and
angry
my
mother
approached
first
there
was
scorn
upon
her
lips
she
was
proud
of
her
ancestry
even
more
than
the
descendant
of
the
randolphs
what
exclaimed
she
what
my
children
these
your
companions
indians
young
powell
rose
to
his
feet
but
said
nothing
in
reply
his
looks
betrayed
what
he
felt
and
that
he
perfectly
understood
the
slight
with
a
haughty
glance
towards
my
father
and
mother
he
beckoned
to
his
sister
to
follow
him
and
walked
proudly
away
virginia
and
i
were
alarmed
and
speechless
we
dared
not
say
adieu
we
were
hurried
from
the
spot
and
homeward
virginia
went
with
my
father
and
mother
there
were
others
in
the
boat
that
had
brought
them
to
the
island
there
were
blacks
who
rowed
but
i
saw
white
men
there
too
the
ringgolds
both
father
and
son
were
of
the
party
i
returned
alone
in
the
skiff
while
crossing
the
lake
i
looked
up
the
canoe
was
just
entering
the
creek
i
could
see
that
the
faces
of
the
and
his
sister
were
turned
towards
us
i
was
watched
and
dared
not
wave
an
adieu
although
there
was
a
sad
feeling
upon
my
heart
a
presentiment
that
we
were
parting
for
long
perhaps
for
ever
alas
the
presentiment
proved
a
just
one
in
three
days
from
that
time
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
far
north
where
i
was
entered
as
a
cadet
in
the
military
academy
of
west
point
my
sister
too
was
sent
to
one
of
those
seminaries
in
which
the
cities
of
the
puritan
people
abound
it
was
long
long
before
either
of
us
again
set
eyes
upon
the
flowery
land
chapter
seventeen
west
point
the
military
college
of
west
point
is
the
finest
school
in
the
world
princes
and
priests
have
there
no
power
true
knowledge
is
taught
and
must
be
learned
under
penalty
of
banishment
from
the
place
the
graduate
comes
forth
a
scholar
not
as
from
oxford

the
pert
parrot
of
a
dead
language
smooth
prosodian
mechanic
rhymster
of
idyllic
verse
but
a
linguist
of
living
tongues
one
who
has
studied

not
neglected

a
botanist

soldier
all
in

a
man
fitted
for
the
higher
duties
of
social
life
capable
of
supervision
and
command
equally
so
of
obedience
and
execution
had
i
been
ever
so
much
disinclined
to
books
in
this
institution
i
could
not
have
indulged
in
idleness
there
is
no
dunce
in

there
is
no
favour
to
family
and
fortune
the
son
of
the
president
would
be
ejected
if
not
able
to
dress
up
with
the
rank
and
under
the
dread
of
disgrace
i
became
perforce
a
diligent
student
in
time
a
creditable
scholar
the
details
of
a
cadet
experience
possess
but
little
interest
a
routine
of
monotonous
duties
only
at
west
point
a
little
harder
than
elsewhere
at
times
but
slightly
differing
from
the
of
a
common
soldier
i
bore
them
bravely
not
that
i
was
inspired
by
any
great
military
ambition
but
simply
from
a
feeling
of
rivalry
i
scorned
to
be
the
laggard
of
my
class
there
were
times
however
when
i
felt
weariness
from
so
much
restraint
it
contrasted
unfavourably
with
the
free
life
i
had
been
accustomed
to
and
often
did
i
feel
a
longing
for
home
for
the
forest
and
the
savanna
and
far
more
for
the
associates
i
had
left
behind
long
lingered
in
my
heart
the
love
of
maumee
long
time
unaffected
by
absence
i
thought
the
void
caused
by
that
sad
parting
would
never
be
filled
up
no
other
object
could
replace
in
my
mind
or
banish
from
my
memory
the
sweet
souvenirs
of
my
youthful
love
morning
noon
and
night
was
that
image
of
picturesque
beauty
outlined
upon
the
retina
of
my
mental
eye
by
day
in
thoughts
by
night
in
dreams
thus
was
it
for
a
long
while
i
thought
it
would
never
be
otherwise
no
other
could
ever
interest
me
as
she
had
done
no
new
joy
could
win
me
to
wander
no
lethe
could
bring
oblivion
had
i
been
told
so
by
an
angel
i
would
not
i
could
not
have
believed
it
ah
it
was
a
misconception
of
human
nature
i
was
but
sharing
it
in
common
with
others
for
most
mortals
have
at
some
period
of
life
laboured
under
a
similar
mistake
alas
it
is
too
true
love
affected
by
time
and
absence
it
will
not
live
upon
memory
alone
the
capricious
soul
however
delighting
in
the
ideal
prefers
the
real
and
positive
though
there
are
but
few
women
in
the
world
there
is
no
one
lovelier
than
all
the
rest
no
man
handsomer
than
all
his
fellows
of
two
pictures
equally
beautiful
that
is
the
more
beautiful
upon
which
the
eye
is
gazing
it
is
not
without
reason
that
lovers
dread
the
parting
hour
was
it
books
that
spoke
of
lines
and
angles
of
bastions
and
embrasures
was
it
drill
drill
drill
by
day
or
the
hard
couch
and
harder
guard
by
night
was
it
any
or
all
of
these
that
began
to
infringe
upon
the
exclusivism
of
that
one
idea
and
at
intervals
drive
it
from
my
thoughts
or
was
it
the
pretty
faces
that
now
and
then
made
their
appearance
at
the
point
the
excursionary
belles
from
saratoga
and
ballston
who
came
to
visit
us
or
the
blonde
daughters
of
the
patroons
our
nearer
neighbours
who
came
more
frequently
and
who
saw
in
each
cadet
the
chrysalis
of
a
hero
the
embryo
of
a
general
which
of
all
these
was
driving
maumee
out
of
my
mind
it
imports
little
what
cause
such
was
the
effect
the
impression
of
my
young
love
became
less
vivid
on
the
page
of
memory
each
day
it
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
was
attenuated
to
a
slim
retrospect
ah
maumee
in
truth
it
was
long
before
this
came
to
pass
those
bright
smiling
faces
danced
long
before
my
eyes
ere
thine
became
eclipsed
long
while
withstood
i
the
flattery
of
those
siren
tongues
but
my
nature
was
human
and
my
heart
yielded
too
easily
to
the
seduction
of
sweet
blandishments
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
my
first
love
was
altogether
gone
it
was
cold
but
not
dead
despite
the
fashionable
flirtations
of
the
hour
it
had
its
seasons
of
remembrance
and
return
oft
upon
the
still
night
guard
came
flitting
before
me
and
then
the
brightest
object
in
the
was
maumee
my
love
for
her
was
cold
not
dead
her
presence
would
have
it
i
am
sure
it
would
even
to
have
heard
from
her
of
her
would
have
produced
a
certain
effect
to
have
heard
that
she
had
forgotten
me
and
given
her
heart
to
another
would
have
restored
my
boyish
passion
in
its
full
vigour
and
entirety
i
am
sure
it
would
i
could
not
have
been
indifferent
then
i
must
still
have
been
in
love
with
maumee
one
key
pushes
out
the
other
but
the
fair
daughters
of
the
north
had
not
yet
obliterated
from
my
heart
this
damsel
of
the
south
during
all
my
cadetship
i
never
saw
her
never
even
heard
of
her
for
five
years
i
was
an
exile
from
home
and
so
was
my
sister
at
intervals
during
that
time
we
were
visited
by
our
father
and
mother
who
made
an
annual
trip
to
the
fashionable
resorts
of
the
north
ballston
spa
saratoga
and
newport
there
during
our
holidays
we
joined
them
and
though
i
longed
to
spend
a
vacation
at
home
i
believe
so
did
virginia
the
mother
was
steel
and
the
father
was
stone
and
our
desires
were
not
gratified
i
suspected
the
cause
of
this
stern
denial
our
proud
parents
dreaded
the
danger
of
a
they
had
not
forgotten
the
tableau
on
the
island
the
ringgolds
met
us
at
the
and
arens
was
still
assiduous
in
his
attentions
to
virginia
he
had
become
a
fashionable
exquisite
and
spent
his
gold
freely
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
tailors
and
who
constitute
the
upper
ten
of
new
york
i
liked
him
no
better
than
ever
though
my
mother
was
still
his
backer
how
he
sped
with
virginia
i
could
not
tell
my
sister
was
now
quite
a
woman
a
fashionable
dame
a
belle
and
had
learnt
much
of
the
world
among
other
things
how
to
conceal
her
emotions
one
of
the
distinguished
accomplishments
of
the
day
she
was
at
times
merry
to
an
extreme
degree
though
her
mirth
appeared
to
me
a
little
artificial
and
often
ended
abruptly
sometimes
she
was
thoughtful
not
unfrequently
cold
and
disdainful
i
fancied
that
in
gaining
so
many
graces
she
had
lost
much
of
what
was
in
my
eyes
more
valuable
than
all
her
gentleness
of
heart
perhaps
i
was
wronging
her
there
were
many
questions
i
would
have
asked
her
but
our
childish
confidence
was
at
an
end
and
delicacy
forbade
me
to
probe
her
heart
of
the
past
we
never
spoke
i
mean
of
past
those
wild
wanderings
in
the
woods
the
sailings
over
the
lake
the
scenes
in
the
island
i
often
wondered
whether
she
had
cause
to
remember
them
whether
her
souvenirs
bore
any
resemblance
to
mine
on
these
points
i
had
never
felt
a
definite
conviction
though
suspicious
at
one
time
even
apprehensive
i
had
been
but
a
blind
watcher
a
too
careless
guardian
surely
my
conjectures
had
been
just
else
why
was
she
now
silent
upon
themes
and
scenes
that
had
so
delighted
us
both
was
her
tongue
tied
by
the
that
we
had
been
doing
wrong
only
known
to
us
by
the
disapproval
of
our
parents
or
was
it
that
in
her
present
sphere
of
fashion
she
disdained
to
remember
the
humble
associates
of
earlier
days
often
did
i
conjecture
whether
there
had
ever
existed
such
a
sentiment
in
her
bosom
and
if
so
whether
it
still
lingered
there
these
were
points
about
which
i
might
never
be
satisfied
the
time
for
such
confidences
had
gone
past
it
is
not
likely
reasoned
i
or
if
there
ever
was
a
feeling
of
tender
regard
for
the
young
indian
it
is
now
forgotten
obliterated
from
her
heart
perhaps
from
her
memory
it
is
not
likely
it
should
survive
in
the
midst
of
her
present
associations
in
the
midst
of
that
of
perfumed
beaux
who
are
hourly
pouring
into
her
ears
the
incense
of
flattery
far
less
probable
would
remember
than
i
and
have
not
i
forgotten
strange
that
of
the
four
hearts
i
knew
only
my
own
whether
young
powell
had
ever
looked
upon
my
sister
with
admiring
eyes
or
she
on
him
i
was
still
ignorant
or
rather
unconvinced
all
i
knew
was
by
mere
conjecture
suspicion
apprehension
what
may
appear
stranger
i
never
knew
the
sentiment
of
that
other
heart
the
one
which
interested
me
more
than
all
it
is
true
i
had
chosen
to
fancy
it
in
my
own
favour
trusting
to
glances
to
gestures
to
slight
actions
never
to
words
i
had
hoped
fondly
but
often
too
had
i
been
the
victim
of
doubt
perhaps
after
all
maumee
had
never
loved
me
many
a
sore
heart
had
i
suffered
from
this
reflection
i
could
now
bear
it
with
more
complacency
and
yet
singular
to
say
it
was
this
very
reflection
that
awakened
the
memory
of
maumee
and
whenever
i
dwelt
upon
it
produced
the
strongest
revulsions
of
my
own
spasmodic
love
wounded
vanity
powerful
as
passion
itself
thy
throes
are
as
strong
as
love
under
their
influence

chandeliers
grow

the
fair
forms
flitting
beneath

half

of

examination

my

to
florida
i
found
that
the
cloud
of
war
was
gathering
over
my
native
land
it
would
soon
burst
and
my
first
essay
in
military
life
would
be
made
in
the
defence
of
hearth
and
home
i
was
not
unprepared
for
the
news
war
is
always
theme
of
interest
within
the
walls
of
a
military
college
and
in
no
place
are
its
probabilities
and
prospects
so
folly
discussed
or
with
so
much
earnestness
for
a
period
of
ten
years
had
the
united
states
been
at
peace
with
all
the
world
the
iron
hand
of
old
hickory
had
awed
the
savage
foe
of
the
frontiers
for
more
than
ten
years
had
the
latter
desisted
from
his
chronic
system
of
retaliation
and
remained
silent
and
still
but
the
pacific
came
to
an
end
once
more
the
red
man
rose
to
assert
his
rights
and
in
a
quarter
most
unexpected
not
on
the
frontier
of
the
far
west
but
in
the
heart
of
the
flowery
land
yes
florida
was
to
be
the
theatre
of
operations
the
stage
on
which
this
new
drama
was
to
be
enacted
a
word
historical
of
florida
for
this
writing
is
in
truth
a
history
in
the
spanish
flag
disappeared
from
the
ramparts
of
san
augustine
and
saint
marks
and
spain
yielded
up
possession
of
this
fair
province
one
of
her
last
footholds
upon
the
continent
of
america
literally
it
was
but
a
foothold
the
spaniards
held
in
florida
a
mere
nominal
possession
long
before
the
cession
the
indians
had
driven
them
from
the
field
into
the
fortress
their
haciendas
lay
in
ruins
their
horses
and
cattle
ran
wild
upon
the
savannas
and
rank
weeds
usurped
the
sites
of
their
once
prosperous
plantations
during
the
century
of
dominion
they
had
made
many
a
fair
settlement
and
the
ruins
of
buildings
far
more
massive
than
aught
yet
attempted
by
their
saxon
successors
attest
the
former
glory
and
power
of
the
spanish
nation
it
was
not
destined
that
the
indians
should
long
hold
the
country
they
had
thus
conquered
another
race
of
white
men
their
equals
in
courage
and
strength
were
moving
down
from
the
north
and
it
was
easy
prophecy
to
say
that
the
red
conquerors
must
in
turn
yield
possession
once
already
had
they
met
in
conflict
with
the
usurpers
led
on
by
that
stern
soldier
who
now
sat
in
the
chair
of
the
president
they
were
defeated
and
forced
further
south
into
the
heart
of
the
land
the
centre
of
the
peninsula
there
however
they
were
secured
by
treaty
a
covenant
solemnly
made
and
solemnly
sworn
to
guaranteed
their
right
to
the
soil
and
the
seminole
was
satisfied
alas
the
covenants
between
the
strong
and
the
weak
are
things
of
convenience
to
be
broken
whenever
the
former
wills
it
in
this
case
shamefully
broken
white
adventurers
settled
along
the
indian
border
they
wandered
over
indian
ground
not
wandered
but
went
they
looked
upon
the
land
they
saw
that
it
was
good
it
would
grow
rice
and
cotton
and
cane
and
indigo
the
olive
and
orange
they
desired
to
possess
it
more
than
desired
they
resolved
it
should
be
theirs
there
was
a
treaty
but
what
cared
they
for
treaties
adventurers
ruined
planters
from
georgia
and
the
carolinas
negro
traders
from
all
parts
of
the
south
what
were
covenants
in
their
eyes
especially
when
made
with
redskins
the
treaty
must
be
got
rid
of
the
great
father
scarcely
more
scrupulous
than
they
approved
their
plan
yes
said
he
it
is
good
the
seminoles
must
be
dispossessed
they
must
remove
to
another
land
we
shall
find
them
a
home
in
the
west
on
the
great
plains
there
they
will
have
wide
their
own
for
ever
no
responded
the
seminoles
we
do
not
wish
to
move
we
are
contented
here
we
love
our
native
land
we
do
not
wish
to
leave
it
we
shall
stay
then
you
will
not
go
willingly
be
it
so
we
are
strong
you
are
weak
we
shall
force
you
though
not
the
letter
this
is
the
very
spirit
of
the
reply
which
jackson
made
to
the
seminoles
the
world
has
an
eye
and
that
eye
requires
to
be
satisfied
even
tyrants
dislike
the
open
breach
of
treaties
in
this
case
political
party
was
more
thought
of
than
the
world
and
a
show
of
justice
became
necessary
the
indians
remained
obstinate
they
liked
their
own
land
they
were
reluctant
to
leave
it
no
wonder
some
pretext
must
be
found
to
dispossess
them
the
old
excuse
that
they
were
mere
idle
hunters
and
made
no
profitable
use
of
the
soil
would
scarcely
avail
it
was
not
true
the
seminole
was
not
exclusively
a
hunter
he
was
a
husbandman
as
well
and
tilled
the
land
rudely
it
may
be
but
was
this
a
reason
for
dispossessing
him
without
this
others
were
easily
found
that
cunning
commissioner
which
their
great
father
sent
them
could
soon
invent
pretexts
he
was
one
who
well
knew
the
art
of
muddying
the
stream
upwards
and
well
did
he
practise
it
the
country
was
soon
filled
with
rumours
of
indians
of
horses
and
cattle
stolen
of
plantations
plundered
of
white
travellers
robbed
and
murdered
all
the
work
of
those
savage
seminoles
a
vile
frontier
press
ever
ready
to
give
tongue
to
the
popular
furor
did
not
fail
in
its
duty
of
exaggeration
but
who
was
to
gazette
the
provocations
the
retaliations
the
wrongs
and
cruelties
inflicted
by
the
other
side
all
these
were
carefully
concealed
a
sentiment
was
soon
created
throughout
the
country
a
sentiment
of
bitter
hostility
towards
the
seminole
kill
the
savage
hunt
him
down
drive
him
out
away
with
him
to
the
west
thus
was
the
sentiment
expressed
these
became
the
popular
cries
when
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
a
wish
it
is
likely
soon
to
seek
gratification
particularly
when
that
wish
coincides
with
the
views
of
its
government
in
this
case
it
did
so
the
government
itself
having
created
it
it
would
be
easy
all
supposed
to
accomplish
the
popular
will
to
dispossess
the
savage
hunt
him
drive
him
out
still
there
was
a
treaty
the
world
had
an
eye
and
there
was
a
thinking
minority
not
to
be
despised
who
opposed
this
clamorous
desire
the
treaty
could
not
be
broken
under
the
light
of
day
how
then
was
this
obstructive
covenant
to
be
got
rid
of
call
the
head
men
together
cajole
them
out
of
it
the
chiefs
are
human
they
are
poor
some
of
them
drunkards
bribes
will
go
far
still
farther
make
a
new
treaty
with
a
double
construction
the
ignorant
savages
will
not
understand
it
obtain
their
signatures
the
thing
is
done
crafty
commissioner
yours
is
the
very
plan
and
you
the
man
to
execute
it
it
done
on
the
of
may
on
the
banks
of
the
oclawaha
the
chiefs
of
the
seminole
nation
in
full
council
assembled
bartered
away
the
land
of
their
fathers
such
was
the
report
given
to
the
world
it
was
true
it
was
not
a
full
council
of
chiefs
it
was
an
assembly
of
traitors
bribed
and
suborned
of
weak
men
flattered
and
intimidated
no
wonder
the
nation
refused
to
accede
to
this
surreptitious
covenant
no
wonder
they
heeded
not
its
terms
but
had
to
be
summoned
to
still
another
council
for
a
freer
and
fuller
signification
of
their
consent
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
great
body
of
the
seminole
nation
repudiated
the
treaty
many
of
the
chiefs
denied
having
signed
it
the
head
chief
onopa
denied
it
some
confessed
the
act
but
declared
they
had
been
drawn
into
it
by
the
influence
and
advice
of
others
it
was
only
the
more
powerful
leaders
of
clans
as
the
brothers
omatla
black
clay
and
big
warrior
who
openly
acknowledged
the
signing
these
last
became
objects
of
jealousy
throughout
the
tribes
they
were
regarded
as
traitors
and
justly
so
their
lives
were
in
danger
even
their
own
retainers
disapproved
of
what
they
had
done
to
understand
the
position
it
is
necessary
to
say
a
word
of
the
political
of
the
seminoles
their
government
was
purely
republican
a
thorough
democracy
perhaps
in
no
other
community
in
the
world
did
there
exist
so
perfect
a
condition
of
freedom
i
might
add
happiness
for
the
latter
is
but
the
natural
offspring
of
the
former
their
state
has
been
compared
to
that
of
the
clans
of
highland
scotland
the
parallel
is
true
only
in
one
respect
like
the
gael
the
seminoles
were
without
any
common
organisation
they
lived
in
tribes
far
apart
each
politically
independent
of
the
other
and
although
in
friendly
relationship
there
was
no
power
of
coercion
between
them
there
was
a
head
chief
king
he
could
not
be
called
for
mico
his
indian
title
has
not
that
signification
the
proud
spirit
of
the
seminole
had
never
sold
itself
to
so
absurd
a
condition
they
had
not
yet
surrendered
up
the
natural
rights
of
man
it
is
only
after
the
state
of
nature
has
been
perverted
and
abased
that
the
kingly
element
becomes
strong
among
a
people
the
head
mico
of
the
seminoles
was
only
a
head
in
name
his
authority
was
purely
personal
he
had
no
power
over
life
or
property
though
occasionally
the
wealthiest
he
was
often
one
of
the
poorest
of
his
people
he
was
more
open
than
any
of
the
others
to
the
calls
of
philanthropy
and
ever
ready
to
disburse
with
free
hand
what
was
in
reality
not
his
people
but
his
own
hence
he
rarely
grew
rich
he
was
surrounded
by
no
retinue
girt
in
by
no
barbarian
pomp
or
splendour
flattered
by
no
flunkey
courtiers
like
the
rajahs
of
the
east
or
on
a
still
more
costly
scale
the
crowned
monarchs
of
the
west
on
the
contrary
his
dress
was
scarcely
conspicuous
often
meaner
than
those
around
him
many
a
common
warrior
was
far
more
than
he
as
with
the
head
chief
so
with
the
chieftains
of
tribes
they
possessed
no
power
over
life
or
property
they
could
not
decree
punishment
a
jury
alone
can
do
this
and
i
make
bold
to
affirm
that
the
punishments
among
these
people
were
in
juster
proportion
to
the
crimes
than
those
decreed
in
the
highest
courts
of
civilisation
it
was
a
system
of
the
purest
republican
freedom
without
one
idea
of
the
levelling
principle
for
merit
produced
distinction
and
authority
property
was
in
common
though
labour
was
partially
so
but
this
community
of
toil
was
a
mutual
arrangement
agreeable
to
all
the
ties
of
family
were
as
sacred
and
strong
as
ever
existed
on
earth
and
these
were
forsooth
red
savages
to
be
dispossessed
of
their
rights
to
be
driven
from
hearth
and
home
to
be
banished
from
their
beautiful
land
to
a
desert
wild
to
be
shot
down
and
hunted
like
beasts
of
the
field
the
last
in
its
most
literal
sense
for
dogs
were
to
be
employed
in
the
pursuit
chapter
nineteen
an
indian
hero
there
were
several
reasons
why
the
treaty
of
the
oclawaha
could
not
be
considered
binding
on
the
seminole
nation
first
it
was
not
signed
by
a
majority
of
the
chiefs
sixteen
chiefs
and
appended
their
names
to
it
there
were
five
times
this
number
in
the
nation
second
it
was
after
all
no
treaty
but
a
mere
conditional
contract
the
conditions
being
that
a
deputation
of
seminoles
should
first
proceed
to
the
lands
allotted
in
the
west
upon
white
river
examine
these
lands
and
bring
back
a
report
to
their
people
the
very
nature
of
this
condition
proves
that
no
contract
for
removal
could
have
been
completed
until
the
exploration
had
been
first
accomplished
the
examination
was
made
seven
chiefs
accompanied
by
an
agent
journeyed
to
the
far
west
and
made
a
survey
of
the
lands
now
mark
the
craft
of
the
commissioner
these
seven
chiefs
are
nearly
all
taken
from
those
friendly
to
the
removal
we
find
among
them
both
the
omatlas
and
black
clay
true
there
is
jumper
a
patriot
but
this
brave
warrior
is
stricken
with
the
indian
curse
he
loves
the
and
his
propensity
is
to
phagan
the
agent
who
accompanies
them
a
is
contemplated
and
is
put
in
practice
the
deputation
is
hospitably
entertained
at
fort
gibson
on
the
arkansas
is
made
merry
the
contract
for
removal
is
spread
before
the
seven
chiefs
they
all
sign
it
and
the
juggle
is
complete
but
even
this
was
no
fulfilment
of
the
terms
of
the
oclawaha
covenant
the
deputation
was
to
return
with
their
report
and
ask
the
will
of
the
nation
that
was
yet
to
be
given
and
in
order
to
obtain
it
a
new
council
of
all
the
chiefs
and
warriors
must
be
summoned
it
was
to
be
a
mere
formality
it
was
that
the
nation
as
a
body
disapproved
of
the
facile
conduct
of
the
seven
chiefs
and
would
not
endorse
it
they
were
not
going
to
move
this
was
the
more
evident
since
other
conditions
of
the
treaty
were
daily
broken
one
of
these
was
the
restoration
of
runaway
slaves
which
the
signers
of
the
oclawaha
treaty
had
promised
to
send
back
to
their
owner
no
blacks
were
sent
back
on
the
contrary
they
now
found
refuge
among
the
indians
more
secure
than
ever
the
commissioner
knew
all
this
he
was
calling
the
new
council
out
of
mere
formality
perhaps
he
might
persuade
them
to
sign
if
not
he
intended
to
awe
them
into
the
measure
or
force
them
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
he
had
said
as
much
troops
were
concentrating
at
the
agency
fort
king
and
others
were
daily
arriving
at
tampa
bay
the
government
had
taken
its
measures
and
coercion
was
resolved
upon
i
was
not
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
nor
of
all
that
had
happened
during
my
long
years
of
absence
my
comrades
the
cadets
were
well
versed
in
indian
affairs
and
took
a
lively
interest
in
them
especially
those
who
expected
soon
to
escape
from
the
college
walls
black
war
just
terminated
in
the
west
had
already
given
some
a
chance
of
service
and
distinction
and
young
ambition
was
now
bending
its
eyes
upon
florida
the
idea
however
of
obtaining
glory
in
such
a
war
was
ridiculed
by
all
it
would
be
too
easy
a
war
the
foe
was
not
worth
considering
a
mere
handful
of
savages
asserted
they
scarcely
enough
of
them
to
stand
before
a
single
company
they
would
be
either
killed
or
captured
in
the
first
skirmish
one
and
all
of
them
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
their
making
any
protracted
resistance
there
was
not
such
was
the
belief
of
my
college
companions
and
indeed
the
common
belief
of
the
whole
country
at
that
time
the
army
too
shared
it
one
officer
was
heard
to
boast
that
he
could
march
through
the
whole
indian
territory
with
only
a
corporal
guard
at
his
back
and
another
with
like
bravado
wished
that
the
government
would
give
him
a
charter
of
the
war
on
his
own
account
he
would
finish
it
for
dollars
these
only
expressed
the
sentiments
of
the
day
no
one
believed
that
the
indians
would
or
could
sustain
a
conflict
with
us
for
any
length
of
time
indeed
there
were
few
who
could
be
brought
to
think
that
they
would
resist
at
all
they
were
only
holding
out
for
better
terms
and
would
yield
before
coming
to
blows
for
my
part
i
thought
otherwise
i
knew
the
seminoles
better
than
most
of
those
who
talked
i
knew
their
country
better
and
notwithstanding
the
odds
against
them
the
apparent
hopelessness
of
the
struggle
i
had
my
belief
that
they
would
neither
yield
to
disgraceful
terms
nor
yet
be
so
easily
conquered
still
it
was
but
a
conjecture
and
i
might
be
wrong
i
might
be
deserving
the
ridicule
which
my
opposition
to
the
belief
of
my
comrades
often
brought
upon
me
the
newspapers
made
us
acquainted
with
every
circumstance
letters
too
were
constantly
received
at
the
point
from
old
graduates
now
serving
in
florida
every
detail
reached
us
and
we
had
become
acquainted
with
the
names
of
many
of
the
indian
chieftains
as
well
as
the
internal
of
the
tribe
it
appeared
they
were
not
united
there
was
a
party
in
favour
of
yielding
to
the
demands
of
our
government
headed
by
one
this
was
the
traitor
party
and
a
minority
the
patriots
were
more
numerous
including
the
head
mico
himself
and
the
powerful
chiefs
holata
and
the
negro
abram
among
the
patriots
there
was
one
name
that
upon
the
wings
of
rumour
began
to
take
precedence
of
all
others
it
appeared
frequently
in
the
daily
prints
and
in
the
letters
of
our
friends
it
was
that
of
a
young
warrior
or
as
he
was
styled
who
by
some
means
or
other
had
gained
a
remarkable
ascendency
in
the
tribe
he
was
one
of
the
most
violent
opponents
of
the
removal
in
fact
the
leading
spirit
that
opposed
it
and
chiefs
much
older
and
more
powerful
were
swayed
by
his
counsel
we
cadets
much
admired
this
young
man
he
was
described
as
possessing
all
the
attributes
of
a
hero
of
noble
aspect
bold
handsome
intelligent
both
his
physical
and
intellectual
qualities
were
spoken
of
in
terms
of
praise
almost
approaching
to
hyperbole
his
form
was
that
of
an
apollo
his
features
adonis
or
endymion
he
was
first
in
everything
the
best
shot
in
his
nation
the
most
expert
swimmer
and
rider
the
swiftest
runner
and
most
successful
hunter
alike
eminent
in
peace
or
war
in
short
a
cyrus
there
were
xenophons
enough
to
record
his
fame
the
people
of
the
united
states
had
been
long
at
peace
with
the
red
men
the
romantic
savage
was
far
away
from
their
borders
it
was
rare
to
see
an
indian
within
the
settlements
or
hear
aught
of
them
there
had
been
no
late
deputations
from
the
tribes
to
gratify
the
eyes
of
gazing
citizens
and
a
real
curiosity
had
grown
up
in
regard
to
these
children
of
the
forest
an
indian
hero
was
wanted
and
this
young
chief
appeared
to
be
the
man
his
name
was
osceola
chapter
twenty
frontier
justice
i
was
not
allowed
long
to
enjoy
the
sweets
of
home
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
i
received
an
order
to
repair
to
fort
king
the
seminole
agency
and
of
the
army
of
florida
general
clinch
there
commanded
i
was
summoned
upon
his
staff
not
without
chagrin
i
prepared
to
obey
the
order
it
was
hard
to
part
so
soon
from
those
who
dearly
loved
me
and
from
whom
i
had
been
so
long
separated
both
mother
and
sister
were
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
my
going
indeed
they
urged
me
to
resign
my
commission
and
remain
at
home
not
unwillingly
did
i
listen
to
their
counsel
i
had
no
heart
in
the
cause
in
which
i
was
called
forth
but
at
such
a
crisis
i
dared
not
follow
their
advice
i
should
have
been
branded
as
a
traitor
a
coward
my
country
had
commissioned
me
to
carry
a
sword
i
must
wield
it
whether
the
cause
be
just
or
unjust
whether
to
my
liking
or
not
this
is
called
there
was
yet
another
reason
for
my
reluctance
to
part
from
home
i
need
hardly
declare
it
since
my
return
my
eyes
had
often
wandered
over
the
lake
often
rested
on
that
fair
island
oh
i
had
not
forgotten
her
i
can
scarcely
analyse
my
feelings
they
were
mingled
emotions
young
love
triumphant
over
older
passions
ready
to
burst
forth
from
the
ashes
that
had
long
shrouded
it
young
love
penitent
and
remorseful
doubt
jealousy
apprehension
all
these
were
active
within
me
since
my
arrival
i
had
not
dared
to
go
forth
i
observed
that
my
mother
was
still
distrustful
i
had
not
dared
even
to
question
those
who
might
have
satisfied
me
i
passed
those
few
days
in
doubt
and
at
intervals
under
a
painful
presentiment
that
all
was
not
well
did
maumee
still
live
was
she
true
true
had
she
reason
had
she
ever
loved
me
there
were
those
near
who
could
have
answered
the
first
question
but
i
feared
to
breathe
her
name
even
to
the
most
intimate
bidding
adieu
to
my
mother
and
sister
i
took
the
route
these
were
not
left
alone
my
maternal
uncle
their
guardian
resided
upon
the
plantation
the
parting
moments
were
less
bitter
from
the
belief
that
i
should
soon
return
even
if
the
anticipated
campaign
should
last
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
the
scene
of
my
duties
would
lie
near
and
i
should
find
frequent
opportunities
of
revisiting
them
my
uncle
scouted
the
idea
of
a
campaign
as
so
did
every
one
the
indians
he
said
would
yield
to
the
demands
of
the
commissioner
fools
if
they
did
fort
king
was
not
distant
it
stood
upon
indian
ground
fourteen
miles
within
the
border
though
further
than
that
from
our
plantation
a
day
journey
would
bring
me
to
it
and
in
company
of
my
cheerful
squire
black
jake
the
road
would
not
seem
long
we
bestrode
a
pair
of
the
best
steeds
the
stables
afforded
and
were
both
armed
we
crossed
the
ferry
at
the
upper
landing
and
rode
within
the
reserve
note
the
path
it
was
only
a
path
ran
parallel
to
the
creek
though
not
near
its
banks
it
passed
through
the
woods
some
distance
to
the
rear
of
madame
powell
plantation
when
opposite
to
the
clearing
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
diverging
track
i
knew
it
well
i
had
oft
trodden
it
with
swelling
heart
i
hesitated
halted
strange
thoughts
careered
through
my
bosom
resolves
and
suddenly
abandoned
the
rein
grew
slack
and
then
tightened
the
spur
threatened
the
ribs
of
my
horse
but
failed
to
strike
shall
i
go
once
more
behold
her
once
more
renew
those
sweet
joys
of
tender
love
once
more
ha
perhaps
it
is
too
late

be
no
longer

massr

tha
all
gone
at
that
moment
an
opening
in
the
woods
enabled
me
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
old
house
there
it
stood
in
all
its
grey
grandeur
still
embowered
in
the
midst
of
beautiful
groves
of
orange
and
olive
but
the
broken
fence
the
tall
weeds
standing
up
against
the
walls
the
shingles
here
and
there
missing
from
the
roof
all
told
the
tale
of
ruin
there
was
ruin
in
my
heart
as
i
turned
sorrowing
away
note
that
portion
of
florida
for
the
seminoles
by
the
treaty
of
moultrie
creek
made
in
it
was
a
large
tract
and
occupied
the
central
part
of
the
peninsula
note
master
or
proprietor
universally
in
use
throughout
the
southern
states
from
the
dutch
baas
chapter
twenty
one
indian
slaves
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
question
the
genuineness
of
jake
story
what
the
black
folks
said
was
true
i
had
no
doubt
of
it
the
whole
transaction
was
redolent
of
the
ringgolds
and
lawyer
grubbs
the
latter
a
half
planter
half
legal
practitioner
of
indifferent
reputation
jake
further
informed
me
that
spence
and
williams
had
disappeared
during
the
progress
of
the
trial
both
afterwards
returned
to
the
settlement
but
no
ulterior
steps
were
taken
against
them
as
there
was
no
one
to
prosecute
as
for
the
stolen
negroes
they
were
never
seen
again
in
that
part
of
the
country
the
robbers
had
no
doubt
carried
them
to
the
of
mobile
or
new
orleans
where
a
sufficient
price
would
be
obtained
to
remunerate
grubbs
for
his
professional
services
as
also
williams
and
spence
for
theirs
the
land
would
become
ringgold
as
soon
as
the
indians
could
be
got
out
of
the
country
and
this
was
the
object
of
the
bill
of
sale
a
transaction
of
like
nature
between
white
man
and
white
man
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
grave
swindle
an
atrocious
crime
the
whites
affected
not
to
believe
it
but
there
were
some
who
knew
it
to
be
true
and
viewed
it
only
in
the
light
of
a
clever
that
it
was
true
i
could
not
doubt
jake
gave
me
reasons
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
in
fact
it
was
only
in
keeping
with
the
general
conduct
of
the
border
adventures
towards
the
unfortunate
natives
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
border
adventures
did
i
say
government
agents
members
of
the
florida
legislature
generals
planters
rich
as
ringgold
all
took
part
in
similar
speculations
i
could
give
names
i
am
writing
truth
and
do
not
fear
contradiction
it
was
easy
enough
therefore
to
credit
the
tale
it
was
only
one
of
twenty
similar
cases
of
which
i
had
heard
the
acts
of
colonel
gad
humphreys
the
indian
agent
of
major
phagan
another
indian
agent
of
dexter
the
notorious
of
floyd
of
douglass
of
robinson
and
millburn
are
all
historic
all
telling
of
outrages
committed
upon
the
suffering
seminole
a
volume
might
be
filled
detailing
such
swindles
as
that
of
grubbs
and
ringgold
in
the
mutual
relations
between
white
man
and
red
man
it
requires
no
skillful
advocate
to
shew
on
which
side
must
lie
the
wrongs
unrepaired
and
unavenged
beyond
all
doubt
the
indian
has
ever
been
the
victim
it
is
needless
to
add
that
there
were
retaliations
how
could
it
be
otherwise
one
remarkable
fact
discloses
itself
in
these
episodes
of
floridian
life
it
is
that
slaves
thus
stolen
from
the
indians
returned
to
their
owners
whenever
they
to
secure
them
from
finding
their
way
back
the
dexters
and
douglasses
were
under
the
necessity
of
taking
them
to
some
distant
market
to
the
far
coasts
of
the
mississippi
to
natchez
or
new
orleans
there
is
but
one
explanation
of
this
social
phenomenon
and
that
is
that
the
slaves
of
the
seminole
were
slaves
in
truth
they
were
treated
with
an
indulgence
to
which
the
helot
of
other
lands
is
a
stranger
they
were
the
agriculturists
of
the
country
and
their
indian
master
was
content
if
they
raised
him
a
little
corn
just
sufficient
for
his
need
with
such
other
vegetable
products
as
his
simple
required
they
lived
far
apart
from
the
dwellings
of
their
owners
their
hours
of
labour
were
few
and
scarcely
compulsory
surplus
product
was
their
own
and
in
most
cases
they
became
rich
far
richer
than
their
own
masters
who
were
less
skilled
in
economy
emancipation
was
easily
purchased
and
the
majority
were
actually
free
though
from
such
claims
it
was
scarcely
worth
while
to
escape
if
slavery
it
could
be
called
it
was
the
mildest
form
ever
known
upon
earth
far
differing
from
the
abject
bondage
of
ham
under
either
shem
or
japheth
it
may
be
asked
how
the
seminoles
became
possessed
of
these
black
slaves
were
they
runaways
from
the
states
from
georgia
and
the
carolinas
alabama
and
the
plantations
of
florida
doubtless
a
few
were
from
this
source
but
most
of
the
runaways
were
not
claimed
as
property
and
arriving
among
the
indians
became
free
there
was
a
time
when
by
the
stern
conditions
of
the
camp
moultrie
covenant
these
absconding
slaves
were
given
up
to
their
white
owners
but
it
is
no
discredit
to
the
seminoles
that
they
were
always
in
the
observance
of
this
disgraceful
stipulation
in
fact
it
was
not
always
possible
to
surrender
back
the
fugitive
negro
black
communities
had
concentrated
themselves
in
different
parts
of
the
reserve
who
under
their
own
leaders
were
socially
free
and
strong
enough
for
it
was
with
these
that
the
runaways
usually
found
refuge
and
welcome
such
a
community
was
that
of
harry
amidst
the
morasses
of
pease
creek
of
abram
at
micosauky
of
charles
and
the
mulatto
king
no
the
negro
slaves
of
the
seminoles
were
runaways
from
the
plantations
though
the
whites
would
wish
to
make
it
appear
so
very
few
were
of
this
class
the
greater
number
was
the
genuine
property
of
their
indian
owners
so
far
as
a
slave
can
be
called
at
all
events
they
were
obtained
some
of
them
from
the
spaniards
the
original
settlers
and
some
by
fair
purchase
from
the
american
planters
themselves
how
purchased
you
will
ask
what
could
a
tribe
of
savages
give
in
exchange
for
such
a
costly
commodity
the
answer
is
easy
horses
and
horned
cattle
of
both
of
these
the
seminoles
possessed
vast
herds
on
the
evacuation
by
the
spaniards
the
savannas
swarmed
with
cattle
of
andalusian
race
the
indians
caught
and
reclaimed
them
became
their
owners
this
then
was
the
pro
quadrupeds
in
exchange
for
bipeds
the
chief
of
the
crimes
charged
against
the
indians
was
the
of
for
the
white
men
had
their
herds
as
well
the
seminoles
did
not
deny
that
there
were
bad
men
amongst
them
lawless
fellows
difficult
to
restrain
where
is
the
community
without
scamps
one
thing
was
very
certain
the
indian
chiefs
when
fairly
appealed
to
have
always
evinced
an
earnest
desire
to
make
restoration
and
exhibited
an
energy
in
the
cause
of

entirely
unknown
upon
the
opposite
side
of
their
border
it
differed
little
how
they
acted
so
far
as
regarded
their
character
among
their
white
neighbours
these
had
made
up
their
mind
that
the
dog
should
be
hanged
and
it
was
necessary
to
give
him
a
bad
name
every
robbery
committed

of
course
the
act
of
an
indian
white
burglars
had
but
to
give
their
faces
a
coat
of
spanish
brown
and
justice
could
not

through

chapter
twenty
two
a
circuitous
transaction
such
were
my
reflections
as
i
journeyed
on
suggested
by
the
sad
tale
to
which
i
had
been
listening
as
if
to
confirm
their
correctness
an
incident
at
that
moment
occurred
exactly
to
the
point
we
had
not
ridden
far
along
the
path
when
we
came
upon
the
tracks
of
cattle
some
twenty
head
must
have
passed
over
the
ground
going
in
the
same
direction
as
ourselves
the
indian
reserve
the
tracks
were
fresh
almost
quite
fresh
i
was
tracker
enough
to
know
that
they
must
have
passed
within
the
hour
though
cloistered
so
long
within
college
walls
i
had
not
forgotten
all
the
forest
craft
taught
me
by
young
powell
the
circumstance
of
thus
coming
upon
a
fresh
or
old
would
have
made
no
impression
upon
me
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
it
some
indian
herdsmen
had
been
driving
home
their
flock
and
that
the
drivers
indians
i
could
perceive
by
the
moccasin
prints
in
the
mud
it
is
true
some
frontiersmen
wear
the
moccasin
but
these
were
not
the
of
white
men
the
toes
note
the
high
instep
other
trifling
signs
which
from
early
training
i
knew
how
to
translate
proved
that
the
tracks
were
indian
so
were
they
agreed
my
groom
and
jake
was
no
slouch
in
the
ways
of
the
woods
he
had
all
his
life
been
a
keen
a
trapper
of
the
the
possum
and
the
gobbler
moreover
he
had
been
my
companion
upon
many
a
many
a
chase
after
the
grey
fox
and
the
rufous
cat
during
my
absence
he
had
added
greatly
to
his
experiences
he
had
succeeded
his
former
rival
in
the
post
of
woodman
which
brought
him
daily
in
contact
with
the
denizens
of
the
forest
and
constant
observation
of
their
habits
had
increased
his
skill
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
negro
brain
is
incapable
of
that
acute
reasoning
which
constitutes
a
cunning
hunter
i
have
known
black
men
who
could
read
sign
and
lift
a
trail
with
as
much
intuitive
quickness
as
either
red
or
white
black
jake
could
have
done
it
i
soon
found
that
in
this
kind
of
knowledge
he
was
now
my
master
and
almost
on
the
instant
i
had
cause
to
be
astonished
at
his
acuteness
i
have
said
that
the
sight
of
the
created
no
surprise
in
either
of
us
at
it
did
not
but
we
had
not
ridden
twenty
paces
further
when
i
saw
my
companion
suddenly
rein
up
at
the
same
instant
giving
utterance
to
one
of
those
ejaculations
peculiar
to
the
negro
thorax
and
closely
resembling
the
wugh
of
a
startled
hog
i
looked
in
his
face
i
saw
by
its
expression
that
he
had
some
revelation
to
make
what
is

why

in

and
so
far
from
his
plantation
and
with
indian
drivers
too
dat
ere
just
what
dis
chile
ca
clarly
make
out
massr
george
there
was
a
singularity
in
the
circumstance
that
induced
reflection
the
cattle
could
not
have
strayed
so
far
of
themselves
the
voluntary
swimming
of
the
river
was
against
such
a
supposition
but
they
were
not
they
were
evidently
and
by
indians
was
it
a
were
the
beeves
being
stolen
it
had
the
look
of
a
bit
of
thievery
and
yet
it
was
not
crafty
enough
the
animals
had
been
driven
along
a
frequented
path
certain
to
be
taken
by
those
in
quest
of
them
and
the
robbers
if
they
were
such
had
used
no
precaution
to
conceal
their
tracks
it
looked
like
a
theft
and
it
did
not
and
it
was
just
this
dubious
aspect
that
stimulated
the
curiosity
of
my
companion
and
myself
so
much
so
that
we
made
up
our
minds
to
follow
the
trail
and
if
possible
ascertain
the
truth
for
a
mile
or
more
the
trail
coincided
with
our
own
route
and
then
turning
abruptly
to
the
left
it
struck
off
towards
a
track
of
hommock
woods
we
were
determined
not
to
give
up
our
intention
lightly
the
tracks
were
so
fresh
that
we
knew
the
herd
must
have
passed
within
the
hour
within
the
quarter
they
could
not
be
distant
we
could
gallop
back
to
the
main
road
through
some
thin
pine
timber
we
saw
stretching
away
to
the
right
and
with
these
reflections
we
turned
head
along
the
shortly
after
entering
the
dense
forest
we
heard
voices
of
men
in
conversation
and
at
intervals
the
routing
of
oxen
we
alit
tied
our
horses
to
a
tree
and
moved
forward
afoot
we
walked
stealthily
and
in
silence
guiding
ourselves
by
the
sounds
of
the
voices
that
kept
up
an
almost
continual
clatter
beyond
a
doubt
the
cattle
whose
bellowing
we
heard
were
those
whose
tracks
we
had
been
tracing
but
equally
certain
was
it
that
the
voices
we
now
listened
to
were
the
voices
of
those
who
had
driven
them
it
is
easy
to
distinguish
between
the
intonation
of
an
indian
and
a
white
man
the
men
whose
conversation
reached
our
ears
were
whites
their
language
was
our
own
with
all
its
coarse
embellishments
my
companion
discernment
went
beyond
this
he
recognised
the
individuals

massr
george
it

and

william
jake
conjecture
proved
correct
we
drew
closer
to
the
spot
the
evergreen
trees
concealed
us
perfectly
we
got
up
to
the
edge
of
an
opening
and
there
saw
the
herd
of
beeves
the
two
indians
who
had
driven
them
and
the
brace
of
worthies
already
named
we
stood
under
cover
watching
and
listening
and
in
a
very
short
while
with
the
help
of
a
few
hints
from
my
companion
i
comprehended
the
whole
affair
each
of
the
indians
worthless
outcasts
of
their
tribe
was
presented
with
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
few
trifling
trinkets
this
was
in
payment
for
their
night
work
the
plunder
of
lawyer
grubb
pastures
their
share
of
the
business
was
now
over
and
they
were
just
in
the
act
of
delivering
up
their
charge
as
we
arrived
upon
the
ground
their
employers
whose
droving
bout
was
here
to
begin
had
just
handed
over
their
rewards
the
indians
might
go
home
and
get
drunk
they
were
no
longer
needed
the
cattle
would
be
taken
to
some
distant
part
of
the
country
where
a
market
would
be
readily
found
or
what
was
of
equal
probability
they
would
find
their
way
back
to
lawyer
grubb
own
plantation
having
been
rescued
by
the
gallant
fellows
spence
and
williams
from
a
band
of
indian
rievers
this
would
be
a
fine
tale
for
the
plantation
fireside
a
rare
chance
for
a
representation
to
the
police
and
the
powers
oh
those
savage
seminole
robbers
they
must
be
got
rid
of
they
must
be
moved
out
as
the
cattle
chanced
to
belong
to
lawyer
grubbs
i
did
not
choose
to
interfere
i
could
tell
my
tale
elsewhere
and
without
making
our
presence
known
my
companion
and
i
turned
silently
upon
our
heels
regained
our
horses
and
went
our
way
reflecting
i
entertained
no
doubt
about
the
justness
of
our
surmise
no
doubt
that
williams
and
spence
had
employed
the
drunken
indians
no
more
that
lawyer
grubbs
had
employed
williams
and
spence
in
this
circuitous
transaction
the
stream
must
be
muddied
upward
the
poor
indian
must
be
driven
to
desperation
note
it
is
art
not
nature
that
causes
this
peculiarity
it
is
done
in
the
cradle
chapter
twenty
three
reflections
by
the
way
at
college
as
elsewhere
i
had
been
jeered
for
taking
the
indian
side
of
the
question
not
unfrequently
was
i
twitted
with
the
blood
of
poor
old
powhatan
which
after
two
hundred
years
of
whitening
must
have
circulated
very
sparsely
in
my
veins
it
was
said
i
was
not
since
i
did
not
join
in
the
vulgar
clamour
so
congenial
to
nations
when
they
talk
of
an
enemy
nations
are
like
individuals
to
please
them
you
must
be
as
wicked
as
they
feel
the
same
sentiment
or
speak
it
which
will
serve
as
well
affect
like
loves
and
hates
in
short
yield
up
independence
of
thought
and
cry
crucify
with
the
majority
this
is
the
world
man
the
patriot
of
the
times
he
who
draws
his
deductions
from
the
fountain
of
truth
and
would
try
to
stem
the
senseless
current
of
a
people
prejudgments
will
never
be
popular
during
life
posthumously
he
may
but
not
this
side
the
grave
such
need
not
seek
the
living
fame
for
which
yearned
the
conqueror
of
peru
he
will
not
find
it
if
the
true
patriot
desire
the
reward
of
glory
he
must
look
for
it
only
from
posterity
long
after
his
mouldering
bones
have
rattled
in
the
tomb
happily
there
is
another
reward
the
conscia
is
not
an
idle
phrase
there
are
those
who
esteem
it
who
have
experienced
both
sustenance
and
comfort
from
its
sweet
whisperings
though
sadly
pained
at
the
conclusions
to
which
i
was
compelled
not
only
by
the
incident
i
had
witnessed
but
by
a
host
of
others
lately
heard
of
i
congratulated
myself
on
the
course
i
had
pursued
neither
by
word
nor
act
had
i
thrown
one
feather
into
the
scale
of
injustice
i
had
no
cause
for
my
conscience
cleared
me
of
all
towards
the
unfortunate
people
who
were
soon
to
stand
before
me
in
the
attitude
of
enemies
my
thoughts
dwelt
not
long
on
the
general
question
scarcely
a
moment
that
was
driven
out
of
my
mind
by
reflections
of
a
more
painful
nature
by
the
sympathies
of
friendship
of
love
i
thought
only
of
the
ruined
widow
of
her
children
of
maumee
it
were
but
truth
to
confess
that
i
thought
only
of
the
last
but
this
thought
comprehended
all
that
belonged
to
her
all
of
hers
were
endeared
though
she
was
the
centre
of
the
endearment
and
for
all
i
now
felt
sympathy
sorrow
ay
a
far
more
poignant
bitterness
than
grief
the
ruin
of
sweet
hopes
i
scarcely
hoped
ever
to
see
them
again
where
were
they
now
whither
had
they
gone
conjectures
apprehensions
fears
floated
upon
my
fancy
i
could
not
avoid
giving
way
to
dark
imaginings
the
men
who
had
committed
that
crime
were
capable
of
any
other
even
the
highest
known
to
the
calendar
of
justice
what
had
become
of
these
friends
of
my
youth
my
companion
could
throw
no
light
on
their
history
after
that
day
of
wrong

tha
had

in

nebba

o
um
nebber
no
more
arterward
even
this
was
a
conjecture
a
little
relief
to
the
heaviness
of
my
thoughts
was
imparted
by
the
changing
scene
hitherto
we
had
been
travelling
through
a
pine
forest
about
noon
we
passed
from
it
into
a
large
tract
of
hommock
that
stretched
right
and
left
of
our
course
the
road
or
path
we
followed
ran
directly
across
it
the
scene
became
suddenly
changed
as
if
by
a
magic
transformation
the
soil
under
our
feet
was
different
as
also
the
foliage
over
our
heads
the
pines
were
no
longer
around
us
our
view
was
interrupted
on
all
sides
by
a
thick
frondage
of
evergreen
trees
some
with
broad
shining
coriaceous
leaves
as
the
magnolia
that
here
grew
to
its
full
stature
alongside
it
stood
the
the
red
mulberry
the
bourbon
laurel
and
while
towering
above
all
rose
the
proudly
waving
its
plumed
crest
in
the
breeze
as
if
saluting
with
supercilious
nod
its
humbler
companions
beneath
for
a
long
while
we
travelled
under
deep
shadow
not
formed
by
the
trees
alone
but
by
their
parasites
as
well
the
large
loaded
with
leaves
the
coiling
creepers
of
and
the
silvery
tufts
of
shrouded
the
sky
from
our
sight
the
path
was
winding
and
intricate
prostrate
trunks
often
carried
it
in
a
circuitous
course
and
often
was
it
obstructed
by
the
matted
trellis
of
the
muscadine
whose
gnarled
limbs
stretched
from
tree
to
tree
like
the
great
of
a
ship
the
scene
was
somewhat
gloomy
yet
grand
and
impressive
it
chimed
with
my
feelings
at
the
moment
and
soothed
me
even
more
than
the
airy
open
of
the
having
crossed
this
belt
of
dark
forest
near
its
opposite
edge
we
came
upon
one
of
these
singular
ponds
already
described
a
circular
basin
surrounded
by
hillocks
and
rocks
of
testaceous
formation
an
extinct
water
volcano
in
the
barbarous
jargon
of
the
saxon
settler
these
are
termed
sinks
though
most
inappropriately
for
where
they
contain
water
it
is
always
of
crystalline
brightness
and
purity
the
one
at
which
we
had
arrived
was
nearly
full
of
the
clear
liquid
our
horses
wanted
drink
so
did
we
it
was
the
hottest
hour
of
the
day
the
woods
beyond
looked
thinner
and
less
shady
it
was
just
the
time
and
place
to
make
a
halt
and
dismounting
we
prepared
to
rest
and
refresh
ourselves
jake
carried
a
capacious
haversack
whose
distended
sides
with
the
necks
of
a
couple
of
bottles
protruding
from
the
pouch
gave
proof
of
the
tender
solicitude
we
had
left
behind
us
the
ride
had
given
me
an
appetite
the
heat
had
caused
thirst
but
the
contents
of
the
haversack
soon
satisfied
the
one
and
a
cup
of
claret
mingled
with
water
from
the
cool
calcareous
fountain
gave
luxurious
relief
to
the
other
a
cigar
was
the
natural
finish
to
this
repast
and
having
lighted
one
i
lay
down
upon
my
back
canopied
by
the
spreading
branches
of
an
umbrageous
magnolia
i
watched
the
blue
smoke
as
it
curled
upward
among
the
shining
leaves
causing
the
tiny
insects
to
flutter
away
from
their
perch
my
emotions
grew
still
thought
became
lull
within
my
bosom
the
powerful
odour
from
the
coral
cones
and
large
blossoms
added
its
narcotic
influences
and
i
fell
asleep
chapter
twenty
four
a
strange
apparition
i
had
been
but
a
few
minutes
in
this
state
of
unconsciousness
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
plunge
as
of
some
one
leaping
into
the
pond
i
was
not
startled
sufficiently
to
look
around
or
even
to
open
my
eyes
jake

dip
thought
i
an
excellent
idea
i
shall
take
one
myself
presently
it
was
a
wrong
conjecture
the
black
had
not
leaped
into
the
water
but
was
still
upon
the
bank
near
me
where
he
also
had
been
asleep
like
myself
awakened
by
the
noise
he
had
started
to
his
feet
and
i
heard
his
voice
crying

i
raised
my

and
looked
towards
the

it
was

jake
who
was
causing
the
commotion
in
the
water
it
was
a
large
alligator
it
had
approached
close
to
the
bank
where
we
were
lying
and
balanced
upon
its
broad
breast
with
muscular
arms
and
webbed
feet
spread
to
their
full
extent
it
was
resting
upon
the
water
and
eyeing
us
with
evident
curiosity
with
head
erect
above
the
surface
and
tail
stiffly
cocked
upward

presented

comic
yet
hideous
aspect

i
said
in
a
half
whisper
tread
gently
and
do
alarm
it
jake
stole
off
to
fetch
the
gun
but
the
reptile
appeared
to
comprehend
our
intentions
for
before
i
could
lay
hands
upon
the
weapon
it
revolved
suddenly
on
the
water
shot
off
with
the
velocity
of
an
arrow
and
dived
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
pool
rifle
in
hand
i
waited
for
some
time
for
its
but
it
did
not
again
come
to
the
surface
likely
enough
it
had
been
shot
at
before
or
otherwise
attacked
and
now
recognised
in
the
upright
form
a
dangerous
enemy
the
proximity
of
the
pond
to
a
frequented
road
rendered
probable
the
supposition
neither
my
companion
nor
i
would
have
thought
more
about
it
but
for
the
similarity
of
the
scene
to
one
to
us
in
truth
the
resemblance
was
remarkable
the
pond
the
rocks
the
trees
that
grew
around
all
bore
a
likeness
to
those
with
which
our
eyes
were
familiar
even
the
reptile
we
had
just
seen
in
form
in
size
in
fierce
ugly
aspect
appeared
the
exact
counterpart
to
that
one
whose
story
was
now
a
legend
of
the
plantation
the
wild
scenes
of
that
day
were
recalled
the
details
starting
fresh
into
our
recollection
as
if
they
had
been
things
of
yesterday
the
luring
of
the
amphibious
monster
the
perilous
encounter
in
the
tank
the
chase
the
capture
the
trial
and
fiery
sentence
the
escape
the
long
lingering
pursuit
across
the
lake
and
the
abrupt
awful
ending
all
were
remembered
at
the
moment
with
vivid
distinctness
i
could
almost
fancy
i
heard
that
cry
of
agony
that
ejaculation
uttered
by
the
victim
as
he
sank
below
the
surface
of
the
water
they
were
not
pleasant
memories
either
to
my
companion
or
myself
and
we
soon
ceased
to
discourse
of
them
as
if
to
bring
more
agreeable
reflections
the
cheerful
gobble
of
a
wild
turkey
at
that
moment
sounded
in
our
ears
and
jake
asked
my
permission
to
go
in
search
of
the
game
no
objection
being
made
he
took
up
the
rifle
and
left
me
i
my
havanna
stretched
myself
as
before
along
the
soft
sward
watched
the
circling
eddies
of
the
purple
smoke
inhaled
the
narcotic
fragrance
of
the
flowers
and
once
more
fell
asleep
this
time
i
dreamed
and
my
dreams
appeared
to
be
only
the
continuation
of
the
thoughts
that
had
been
so
recently
in
my
mind
they
were
visions
of
that
eventful
day
and
once
more
its
events
passed
in
review
before
me
just
as
they
had
occurred
in
one
thing
however
my
dream
differed
from
the
reality
i
dreamt
that
i
saw
the
mulatto
rising
back
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
climbing
out
upon
the
shore
of
the
island
i
dreamt
that
he
had
escaped
unscathed
unhurt
that
he
had
returned
to
revenge
himself
that
by
some
means
he
had
got
me
in
his
power
and
was
about
to
kill
me
at
this
crisis
in
my
dream
i
was
again
suddenly
awakened
this
time
not
by
the
plashing
of
water
but
by
the
sharp
spang
of
a
rifle
that
had
been
fired
near
jake
has
found
the
turkeys
thought
i
i
hope
he
has
taken
good
aim
i
should
like
to
carry
one
to
the
fort
it
might
be
welcome
at
the
since
i
hear
that
the
larder
is
not
overstocked
jake
is
a
good
shot
and
not
likely
to
miss
if
my
reflections
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
second
report
which
from
its
sharp
detonation
i
knew
to
be
also
that
of
a
rifle
my
god
what
can
it
mean
jake
has
but
one
gun
and
but
one
barrel
he
can
not
have
reloaded
since
he
has
not
had
time
was
the
first
only
a
fancy
of
my
dream
surely
i
heard
a
report
surely
it
was
that
which
awoke
me
there
were
two
shots
i
could
not
be
mistaken
in
surprise
i
sprang
to
my
feet
i
was
alarmed
as
well
i
was
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
my
companion
certainly
i
had
heard
two
reports
two
rifles
must
have
been
fired
and
by
two
men
jake
may
have
been
one
but
who
was
the
other
we
were
upon
dangerous
ground
was
it
an
enemy
i
shouted
out
calling
the
black
by
name
i
was
relieved
on
hearing
his
voice
i
heard
it
at
some
distance
off
in
the
woods
but
i
drew
fresh
alarm
from
it
as
i
listened
it
was
uttered
not
in
reply
to
my
call
but
in
accents
of
terror
mystified
as
well
as
alarmed
i
seized
my
pistols
and
ran
forward
to
meet
him
i
could
tell
that
he
was
coming
towards
me
and
was
near
but
under
the
dark
shadow
of
the
trees
his
black
body
was
not
yet
visible
he
still
continued
to
cry
out
and
i
could
now
distinguish
what
he
was
saying
gorramighty
gorramighty
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
extreme
terror
lor
massa
george
are
you
hurt
hurt
what
the
deuce
should
hurt
me
but
for
the
two
reports
i
should
have
fancied
that
he
had
fired
the
rifle
in
my
direction
and
was
under
the
impression
he
might
have
hit
me
you
are
not
shot
gorramighty
be
thank
you
are
not
shot
massr
george
why
jake
what
does
it
all
mean
at
this
moment
he
emerged
from
the
heavy
timber
and
in
the
open
ground
i
had
a
clear
view
of
him
his
aspect
did
not
relieve
me
from
the
apprehension
that
something
strange
had
occurred
he
was
the
very
picture
of
terror
as
exhibited
in
a
negro
his
eyes
were
rolling
in
their
sockets
the
whites
oftener
visible
than
either
pupil
or
iris
his
lips
were
white
and
bloodless
the
black
skin
upon
his
face
was
blanched
to
an
ashy
paleness
and
his
teeth
chattered
as
he
spoke
his
attitudes
and
gestures
confirmed
my
belief
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
terror
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
ran
hurriedly
up
and
grasped
me
by
the
arm
at
the
same
time
casting
fearful
glances
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
as
if
some
dread
danger
was
behind
him
i
knew
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
jake
was
no
coward
quite
the
contrary
there
must
have
been
peril
then
what
was
it
i
looked
back
but
in
the
dark
depths
of
the
forest
shade
i
could
distinguish
no
other
object
than
the
brown
trunks
of
the
trees
i
again
appealed
to
him
for
an
explanation

what

we
had
been
advancing
towards
the
pond
and
were
now
close
to
the
magnolia
under
whose
shade
i
had
slept
i
observed
jake
in
a
stooping
attitude
under
the
tree
and
pointing
to
its
trunk
i
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
low
down
on
the
smooth
bark
i
saw
the
score
of
a
bullet
it
had
creased
the
tree
and
passed
onward
the
wound
was
green
and
fresh
the
sap
still
flowing
beyond
doubt
i
had
been
fired
at
by
some
one
and
missed
only
by
an
inch
the
leaden
missile
must
have
passed
close
to
my
head
where
it
rested
upon
the
valise
close
to
my
ears
too
for
i
now
remembered
that
almost
simultaneously
with
the
first
report
i
had
heard
the
wheep
of
a
bullet
now
you
um
massr
george
interposed
the
black
with
an
air
of
confident
interrogation
now
you
dat
dis

certainly
i
believe
that
i
have
been
shot
at
by
some
one
yell

earnestly
asseverated
my
companion
i

or
red
skin
we
ca
shift
our
quarters
too
soon
give
me
the
rifle
i
shall
keep
watch
while
you
are
saddling
haste
and
let
us
be
gone
i
speedily
reloaded
the
piece
and
placing
myself
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
turned
my
eyes
in
that
direction
whence
the
shot
must
have
come
the
black
brought
the
horses
to
the
rear
of
my
position
and
proceeded
with
all
despatch
to
saddle
them
and
buckle
on
our
i
need
not
say
that
i
watched
with
anxiety
with
fear
such
a
deadly
attempt
proved
that
a
deadly
enemy
was
near
whoever
he
might
be
the
supposition
that
it
was
yellow
jake
was
too
preposterous
i
of
course
ridiculed
the
idea
i
had
been
an
of
his
certain
and
awful
doom
and
it
would
have
required
stronger
testimony
than
even
the
solemn
declaration
of
my
companion
to
have
given
me
faith
either
in
a
ghost
or
a
resurrection
i
had
been
fired
at
that
fact
could
not
be
questioned
and
by
some
one
whom
my
follower
under
the
uncertain
light
of
the
gloomy
forest
and
blinded
by
his
fears
had
taken
for
yellow
jake
of
course
this
was
a
fancy
a
mistake
as
to
the
personal
identity
of
our
unknown
enemy
there
could
be
no
other
explanation
ha
why
was
i
at
that
moment
dreaming
of
him
of
the
mulatto
and
why
such
a
dream
if
i
were
to
believe
the
statement
of
the
black
it
was
the
very
realisation
of
that
unpleasant
vision
that
had
just
passed
before
me
in
my
sleep
a
cold
shuddering
came
over
me
my
blood
grew
chill
within
my
veins
my
flesh
crawled
as
i
thought
over
this
most
singular
coincidence
there
was
something
awful
in
it
something
so
damnably
probable
that
i
began
to
think
there
was
truth
in
the
solemn
allegation
of
the
black
and
the
more
i
pondered
upon
it
the
less
power
felt
i
to
impeach
his
veracity
why
should
an
indian
thus
unprovoked
have
singled
out
for
his
deadly
aim
true
there
was
hostility
between
red
and
white
but
not
war
surely
it
had
not
yet
come
to
this
the
council
of
chiefs
had
not
met
the
meeting
was
fixed
for
the
following
day
and
until
its
result
should
be
known
it
was
not
likely
that
hostilities
would
be
practised
on
either
side
such
would
materially
influence
the
determinations
of
the
projected
assembly
the
indians
were
as
much
interested
in
keeping
the
peace
as
their
white
adversaries
ay
far
more
indeed
and
they
could
not
help
knowing
that
an
demonstration
of
this
kind
would
be
to
their
disadvantage
just
the
very
pretext
which
the
removal
party
would
have
wished
for
could
it
then
have
been
an
indian
who
aimed
at
my
life
and
if
not
who
in
the
world
besides
had
a
motive
for
killing
i
could
think
of
no
one
whom
i
had
offended
at
least
no
one
that
i
had
provoked
to
such
deadly
retribution
the
drunken
drovers
came
into
my
mind
little
would
they
care
for
treaties
or
the
result
of
the
council
a
horse
a
saddle
a
gun
a
trinket
would
weigh
more
in
their
eyes
than
the
safety
of
their
whole
tribe
both
were
evidently
true
bandits
for
there
are
robbers
among
red
skins
as
well
as
white
ones
but
no
it
could
not
have
been
they
they
had
not
seen
us
as
we
passed
or
even
if
they
had
they
could
hardly
have
been
upon
the
ground
so
soon
we
had
ridden
briskly
after
leaving
them
and
they
were
afoot
spence
and
williams
were
mounted
and
from
what
jake
had
told
me
as
we
rode
along
in
regard
to
the
past
history
of
these
two
rowdies
i
could
believe
them
capable
of
anything
even
of
that
but
it
was
scarcely
probable
either
they
had
not
seen
us
and
besides
they
had
their
hands
full
ha
i
guessed
it
at
last
at
all
events
i
had
hit
upon
the
most
probable
conjecture
the
villain
was
some
runaway
from
the
settlements
some
absconding
slave
perhaps
who
had
sworn
eternal
hostility
to
the
whites
and
who
was
thus
wreaking
his
vengeance
on
the
first
who
had
crossed
his
path
a
mulatto
no
doubt
and
maybe
bearing
some
resemblance
to
yellow
jake
for
there
is
a
general
similarity
among
men
of
yellow
complexion
as
among
blacks
this
would
explain
the
delusion
under
which
my
companion
was
labouring
at
all
events
it
rendered
his
mistake
more
natural
and
with
this
supposition
whether
true
or
false
i
was
forced
to
content
myself
jake
had
now
got
everything
in
readiness
and
without
staying
to
seek
any
further
solution
of
the
mystery
we
leaped
to
our
saddles
and
galloped
away
from
the
ground
we
rode
for
some
time
with
the
beard
on
the
shoulder
and
as
our
path
now
lay
through
thin
woods
we
could
see
for
a
long
distance
behind
us
no
enemy
white
or
black
red
or
yellow
made
his
appearance
either
on
our
front
flank
or
rear
we
encountered
not
a
living
creature
till
we
rode
up
to
the
stockade
of
fort
king
note
which
we
entered
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
dark
line
of
the
forest
horizon
note
called
after
a
distinguished
officer
in
the
american
army
such
is
the
fashion
in
naming
the
frontier
posts
chapter
twenty
six
a
frontier
fort
the
word
fort
calls
up
before
the
mind
a
massive
structure
with
angles
and
embrasures
bastions
and
battlements
curtains
casemates
and
glacis
a
place
of
great
strength
for
this
is
its
essential
signification
such
structures
have
the
spaniards
raised
in
florida
as
elsewhere
some
of
which
note
are
still
standing
while
others
even
in
their
ruins
bear
witness
to
the
grandeur
and
glory
that
enveloped
them
at
that
time
when
the
leopard
flag
waved
proudly
above
their
walls
there
is
a
remarkable
dissimilarity
between
the
colonial
architecture
of
spain
and
that
of
other
european
nations
in
america
the
spaniards
built
without
regard
to
pains
or
expense
as
if
they
believed
that
their
tenure
would
be
eternal
even
in
florida
they
could
have
no
idea
their
lease
would
be
so
short
no
forecast
of
so
early
an
ejectment
after
all
these
great
fortresses
served
them
a
purpose
but
for
their
protection
the
dark
yamassee
and
after
him
the
conquering
seminole
would
have
driven
them
from
the
flowery
peninsula
long
before
the
period
of
their
actual
rendition
the
united
states
has
its
great
stone
fortresses
but
far
different
from
these
are
the
forts
of
frontier
phraseology
which
figure
in
the
story
of
border
wars
and
which
at
this
hour
gird
the
territory
of
the
united
states
as
with
a
gigantic
chain
in
these
are
no
grand
battlements
of
cut
rock
no
costly
casemates
no
idle
ornaments
of
engineering
they
are
rude
erections
of
hewn
logs
of
temporary
intent
put
up
at
little
expense
to
be
abandoned
with
as
little
loss
ready
to
follow
the
frontier
in
its
rapid
recession
such
structures
are
admirably
adapted
to
the

with

the
that
presented
itself
as
i
rode
into
the
gateway
of
fort
king
of
late
not
much
used
to
the
saddle
the
ride
had
fatigued
me
i
heard
the
but
not
yet
being
ordered
on
duty
i
disregarded
the
call
and
kept
my
bed
till
a
later
hour
the
notes
of
a
bugle
bursting
through
the
open
window
and
the
quick
rolling
of
drums
once
more
awoke
me
i
recognised
the
parade
music
and
sprang
from
my
couch
jake
at
this
moment
entered
to
assist
me
in
my
toilet

floridy
whugh
i
looked
forth
the
scene
was
picturesque
and
impressive
inside
the
stockade
soldiers
were
hurrying
to
and
fro
the
different
companies
forming
for
parade
they
were
no
longer
as
on
the
evening
before
slouched
and
loosely
attired
but
with
jackets
close
buttoned
caps
jauntily
cocked
belts
to
a
snowy
whiteness
guns
bayonets
and
buttons
gleaming
under
the
sunlight
they
presented
a
fine
military
aspect
officers
were
moving
among
them
distinguished
by
their
more
splendid
uniforms
and
shining
epaulets
and
a
little
apart
stood
the
general
himself
surrounded
by
his
staff
conspicuous
under
large
black
chapeaus
with
nodding
plumes
of
cock
feathers
white
and
scarlet
alongside
the
general
was
the
commissioner
himself
a
general
in
full
government
uniform
this
grand
display
was
intended
for
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
indians
there
were
several
civilians
within
the
enclosure
planters
from
the
neighbourhood
among
whom
i
recognised
the
ringgolds
so
far
the
impressive
the
picturesque
lay
beyond
the
stockade
on
the
level
plain
that
stretched
to
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
in
front
were
groups
of
tall
indian
warriors
attired
in
their
savage
finery
turbaned
painted
and
plumed
no
two
were
dressed
exactly
alike
and
yet
there
was
a
similarity
in
the
style
of
all
some
wore
of
buckskin
with
leggings
and
moccasins
of
like
material
all
profusely
fringed
beaded
and
tasselled
others
were
clad
in
tunics
of
printed
cotton
stuff
checked
or
flowered
with
leggings
of
cloth
blue
green
or
scarlet
reaching
from
hip
to
ankle
and
girt
below
the
knee
with
gaiters
whose
tagged
and
tasselled
ends
hung
down
the
outside
of
the
leg
the
gorgeous
wampum
belt
encircled
their
waists
behind
which
were
stuck
their
long
knives
tomahawks
and
in
some
instances
pistols
glittering
with
a
rich
inlay
of
silver
relics
left
them
by
the
spaniards
some
instead
of
the
indian
wampum
encircled
their
waists
with
the
spanish
scarf
of
scarlet
silk
its
fringed
extremities
hanging
square
with
the
skirt
of
the
tunic
adding
gracefulness
to
the
garment
a
picturesque
was
not
wanting
to
complete
the
striking
costume
and
in
this
the
variety
was
still
greater
some
wore
the
beautiful
coronet
of
plumes
the
feathers
stained
to
a
variety
of
brilliant
hues
some
the
toque
of
checked
bandanna
while
others
wore
caps
of
fur
of
the
black
squirrel
the
bay
lynx
or
raccoon
the
face
of
the
animal
often
fantastically
set
to
the
front
the
heads
of
many
were
covered
with
broad
fillets
of
embroidered
wampum
out
of
which
stood
the
wing
plumes
of
the
king
vulture
or
the
gossamer
feathers
of
the
crane
a
few
were
still
further
distinguished
by
the
nodding
plumes
of
the
great
bird
of
afric
all
carried
guns
the
long
rifle
of
the
backwoods
hunter
with
horns
and
pouches
slung
from
their
shoulders
neither
bow
nor
arrow
was
to
be
seen
except
in
the
hands
of
the
youth
many
of
whom
were
upon
the
ground
mingling
with
the
warriors
further
off
i
could
see
tents
where
the
indians
had
pitched
their
camp
they
were
not
together
but
scattered
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
here
and
there
in
clusters
with
banners
floating
in
front
denoting
the
different
clans
or
to
which
each
belonged
women
in
their
long
frocks
could
be
seen
moving
among
the
tents
and
little
papooses
were
playing
over
the
grassy
sward
in
front
of
them
when
i
first
saw
them
the
warriors
were
assembling
in
front
of
the
stockade
some
had
already
arrived
and
stood
in
little
crowds
conversing
while
others
strode
over
the
ground
passing
from
group
to
group
as
if
bearing
words
of
council
from
one
to
the
other
i
could
not
help
observing
the
upright
carriage
of
these
magnificent
men
i
could
not
help
admiring
their
full
free
port
and
contrasting
it
with
the
gingerly
step
of
the
drilled
soldier
no
eye
could
have
looked
upon
them
without
acknowledging
this
superiority
of
the
as
i
glanced
along
the
line
of
saxon
and
celtic
soldiery
starched
and
stiff
as
they
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
heel
to
heel
and
then
looked
upon
the
plumed
warriors
without
as
they
proudly
strode
over
the
sward
of
their
native
soil
i
could
not
help
the
reflection
that
to
conquer
these
men
we
must
needs
them
i
should
have
been
laughed
at
had
i
given
expression
to
the
thought
it
was
contrary
to
all
experience
contrary
to
the
burden
of
many
a
boasting
legend
of
the
borders
the
indian
had
always
succumbed
but
was
it
to
the
superior
strength
and
courage
of
his
white
antagonist
no
the
inequality
lay
in
numbers
oftener
in
arms
this
was
the
secret
of
our
superiority
what
could
avail
the
wet
bowstring
and
shaft
against
the
bullet
of
the
rifle
there
was
no
inequality
now
those
hunter
warriors
carried
the
and
could
handle
it
as
skillfully
as
we
the
indians
now
formed
into
a
in
front
of
the
fort
the
chiefs
having
aligned
themselves
so
as
to
form
the
concave
side
of
the
curve
sat
down
upon
the
grass
behind
them
the
and
more
noted
warriors
took
their
places
and
still
further
back
in
rank
after
rank
stood
the
common
men
of
the
tribes
even
the
women
and
boys
drew
near
clustering
thickly
behind
and
regarding
the
movements
of
the
men
with
quiet
but
eager
interest
contrary
to
their
usual
habits
they
were
grave
and
silent
it
is
not
their
character
to
be
so
for
the
seminole
is
as
free
of
speech
and
laughter
as
the
clown
of
the
circus
ring
even
the
negro
scarcely
equals
him
in
jovialty
it
was
not
so
now
but
the
very
reverse
chiefs
warriors
and
women
even
the
boys
who
had
just
forsaken
their
play
all
wore
an
aspect
of
solemnity
no
wonder
that
was
no
ordinary
assemblage
no
meeting
upon
a
trivial
matter
but
a
council
at
which
was
to
be
decided
one
of
the
dearest
interests
of
their
lives
a
council
whose
decree
might
part
them
forever
from
their
native
land
no
wonder
they
did
not
exhibit
their
habitual
gaiety
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
all
looked
grave
in
that
of
chiefs
were
men
of
opposite
views
there
were
those
who
wished
for
the
removal
who
had
private
reasons
to
desire
it
men
bribed
suborned
or
tampered
with
traitors
to
their
tribe
and
nation
these
were
neither
weak
nor
few
some
of
the
most
powerful
chiefs
had
been
bought
over
and
had
agreed
to
sell
the
rights
of
their
people
their
treason
was
known
or
suspected
and
this
it
was
that
was
causing
the
anxiety
of
the
others
had
it
been
otherwise
had
there
been
no
division
in
the
ranks
the
patriot
party
might
easily
have
obtained
a
triumphant
decision
but
they
feared
the
defection
of
traitors
the
band
had
struck
up
a
march
the
troops
were
in
motion
and
filing
through
the
gate
hurrying
on
my
uniform
i
hastened
out
and
took
my
place
among
the
staff
of
the
general
a
few
minutes
after
we
were
on
the
ground
face
to
face
with
the
assembled
chiefs
the
troops
formed
in
line
the
general
taking
his
stand
in
front
of
the
colours
with
the
commissioner
by
his
side
behind
these
were
grouped
the
officers
of
the
staff
with
clerks
interpreters
and
some
civilians
of
note
the
ringgolds
and
others
who
by
courtesy
were
to
take
part
in
the
proceedings
hands
were
shaken
between
the
officers
and
chiefs
the
friendly
calumet
was
passed
round
and
the
council
at
length
inaugurated

note
an
american
officer
is
rarely
to
be
seen
in
full
uniform
still
more
rarely
when
on
campaigning
service
as
in
florida
chapter
twenty
seven
the
council
first
came
the
speech
of
the
commissioner
it
is
too
voluminous
to
be
given
in
detail
its
chief
points
were
an
appeal
to
the
indians
to
conform
peaceably
to
the
terms
of
the
oclawaha
treaty
to
yield
up
their
lands
in
florida
to
move
to
the
west
to
the
country
assigned
them
upon
the
white
river
of
arkansas
in
short
to
accept
all
the
terms
which
the
government
had
commissioned
him
to
require
he
took
pains
to
specify
the
advantages
which
would
accrue
from
the
removal
he
painted
the
new
home
as
a
perfect
paradise
prairies
covered
with
game
elk
antelopes
and
buffalo
rivers
teeming
with
fish
crystal
waters
and
unclouded
skies
could
he
have
found
credence
for
his
words
the
seminole
might
have
fancied
that
the
happy
of
his
fancied
heaven
existed
in
reality
upon
the
earth
on
the
other
hand
he
pointed
out
to
the
indians
the
consequences
of
their
white
men
would
be
settling
thickly
along
their
borders
bad
white
men
would
enter
upon
their
lands
there
would
be
strife
and
the
spilling
of
blood
the
red
man
would
be
tried
in
the
court
of
the
white
man
where
according
to
law
his
oath
would
be
of
no
avail
and
he
must
suffer
such
were
in
reality
the
sentiments
of
mr
commissioner
wiley
thompson
historically
true
uttered
in
the
council
of
fort
king
in
april
i
shall
give
them
in
his
own
words
they
are
worthy
of
record
as
a
specimen
of
between
white
and
red
thus
spoke
he
suppose
what
is
however
impossible
that
you
could
be
permitted
to
remain
here
for
a
few
years
longer
what
would
be
your
condition
this
land
will
soon
be
surveyed
sold
to
and
settled
by
the
whites
is
now
a
surveyor
in
the
the
jurisdiction
of
the
government
will
soon
be
extended
over
you
your
laws
will
be
set
aside
your
chiefs
will
cease
to
be
chiefs
claims
for
debt
and
for
your
negroes
would
be
set
up
against
you
by
bad
white
men
or
you
would
perhaps
be
charged
with
crimes
affecting
life
you
would
be
haled
before
the
white
man
court
the
claims
and
charges
would
be
decided
by
the
white
law
white
men
would
be
witnesses
against
you
indians
would
not
be
permitted
to
give
evidence
your
condition
in
a
few
years
would
be
hopeless
wretchedness
you
would
be
reduced
to
abject
poverty
and
when
urged
by
hunger
to
ask
perhaps
from
the
man
who
had
thus
ruined
you
for
a
crust
of
bread
you
might
be
called
an
indian
dog
and
spurned
from
his
presence
for
this
reason
it
is
that
your
father
wishes
to
remove
you
to
the
west
to
save
you
from
all
these
evils
and
this
language
in
the
face
of
a
former
treaty
that
of
camp
moultrie
which
guaranteed
to
the
seminoles
their
right
to
remain
in
florida
and
the
third
article
of
which
runs
thus
the
united
states
will
take
the
florida
indians
under
their
care
and
patronage
will
afford
them
protection
against
all
persons
tempora
o
the
speech
was
a
mixture
of
sophistry
and
implied
menace
now
uttered
in
the
tones
of
a
petitioner
anon
assuming
the
bold
air
of
the
bully
it
was
by
no
means
clever
both
characters
being
overdone
the
commissioner
felt
no
positive
hostility
towards
the
seminoles
he
was
indignant
only
with
those
chiefs
who
had
already
raised
opposition
to
his
designs
and
one
in
particular
he
but
the
principal
by
which
he
was
inspired
was
a
desire
to
do
the
work
for
which
he
had
been
delegated
an
ambition
to
carry
out
the
wish
of
his
government
and
nation
and
thus
gain
for
himself
credit
and
glory
at
this
shrine
he
was
ready
as
most
officials
are
to
sacrifice
his
personal
independence
of
thought
with
every
principle
of
morality
and
honour
what
matters
the
cause
so
long
as
it
is
the
king
make
it
congress
instead
of
king
and
you
have
the
motto
of
our
indian
agent
shallow
as
was
the
speech
it
was
not
without
its
effects
the
weak
and
wavering
were
influenced
by
it
the
flattering
sketch
of
their
new
home
with
the
contrasted
awful
picture
of
what
might
be
their
future
condition
affected
the
minds
of
many
during
that
spring
the
seminoles
had
planted
but
little
corn
the
summons
of
war
had
been
sounding
in
their
ears
and
they
had
neglected
seed
time
there
would
be
no
harvest
no
maize
nor
rice
nor
yams
already
were
they
suffering
from
their
improvidence
even
then
were
they
collecting
the
roots
of
the
china
briar
note
and
the
acorns
of
the
how
much
worse
would
be
their
condition
in
the
winter
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
gave
way
to
apprehension
and
i
noticed
many
whose
countenances
bore
an
expression
of
awe
even
the
patriot
chiefs
appeared
to
evince
some
apprehension
for
the
result
they
were
not
dismayed
however
after
a
short
interval
one
of
the
strongest
opponents
of
the
removal
rose
to
reply
there
is
no
order
of
precedence
in
such
matters
the
tribes
have
their
acknowledged
orators
who
are
usually
permitted
to
express
the
sentiments
of
the
rest
the
head
chief
was
present
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
with
a
british
crown
upon
his
head
a
relic
of
the
american
revolution
but
onopa
was
no
orator
and
waived
his
right
to
reply
in
favour
of
his
the
latter
had
the
double
reputation
of
being
a
wise
councillor
and
brave
warrior
he
was
furthermore
one
of
the
most
eloquent
speakers
in
the
nation
he
was
the
of
onopa
and
to
carry
the
comparison
into
classic
times
he
might
be
styled
the
ulysses
of
his
people
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
of
dark
complexion
sharp
aquiline
features
and
somewhat
sinister
aspect
he
was
not
of
the
seminole
race
but
as
he
stated
himself
a
descendant
of
one
of
the
ancient
tribes
who
peopled
florida
in
the
days
of
the
early
spaniards
perhaps
he
was
a
yamassee
and
his
dark
skin
would
favour
this
supposition
his
powers
of
oratory
may
be
gathered
from
his
speech
at
the
treaty
of
moultrie
it
was
engaged
that
we
should
rest
in
peace
upon
the
land
allotted
to
us
for
twenty
years
all
difficulties
were
buried
and
we
were
assured
that
if
we
died
it
should
not
be
by
the
violence
of
the
white
man
but
in
the
course
of
nature
the
lightning
should
not
rive
and
blast
the
tree
but
the
cold
of
old
age
should
dry
up
the
sap
and
the
leaves
should
wither
and
fall
and
the
branches
drop
and
the
trunk
decay
and
die
the
deputation
stipulated
at
the
talk
on
the
oclawaha
to
be
sent
on
the
part
of
the
nation
was
only
authorised
to
the
country
to
which
it
was
proposed
to
remove
us
and
bring
back
its
report
to
the
nation
we
went
according
to
agreement
and
saw
the
land
it
is
no
doubt
good
land
and
the
fruit
of
the
soil
may
smell
sweet
and
taste
well
and
be
healthy
but
it
is
surrounded
with
bad
and
hostile
neighbours
and
the
fruit
of
bad
neighbourhood
is
blood
that
spoils
the
land
and
fire
that
dries
up
the
brook
even
of
the
horses
we
carried
with
us
some
were
stolen
by
the
pawnees
and
the
riders
obliged
to
carry
their
packs
on
their
backs
you
would
send
us
among
bad
indians
with
whom
we
could
never
be
at
rest
when
we
saw
the
land
we
said
nothing
but
the
agents
of
the
united
states
made
us
sign
our
hands
to
a
paper
which
say
signified
our
consent
to
remove
but
we
did
no
more
than
say
we
liked
the
land
and
when
we
returned
the
would
we
had
no
authority
to
do
more
your
talk
is
a
good
one
but
my
people
can
not
say
they
will
go
the
people
differ
in
their
opinions
and
must
be
indulged
with
time
to
reflect
they
can
not
consent
now
they
are
not
willing
to
go
if
their
tongues
say
yes
their
hearts
cry
no
and
call
them
liars
we
are
not
hungry
for
other
lands
why
should
we
go
and
hunt
for
them
we
like
our
own
land
we
are
happy
here
if
suddenly
we
tear
our
hearts
from
the
homes
round
which
they
are
twined
our
will
snap
we
can
not
consent
to
go
will
not
a
chief
of
the
removal
party
spoke
next
he
was
omatla
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
tribe
and
suspected
of
an
alliance
with
the
agent
his
speech
was
of
a
pacific
character
recommending
his
not
to
make
any
difficulty
but
act
as
honourable
men
and
comply
with
the
treaty
of
the
oclawaha
it
was
evident
this
chief
spoke
under
restraint
he
feared
to
show
too
openly
his
partiality
for
the
plans
of
the
commissioner
dreading
the
vengeance
of
the
patriot
warriors
these
frowned
upon
him
as
he
stood
up
and
he
was
frequently
interrupted
by
arpiucki
coa
hajo
and
others
a
bolder
speech
expressing
similar
views
was
delivered
by
lusta
hajo
the
black
clay
he
added
little
to
the
argument
but
by
his
superior
daring
restored
the
confidence
of
the
traitorous
party
and
the
equanimity
of
the
commissioner
who
was
beginning
to
exhibit
signs
of
impatience
and
excitement
holata
mico
next
rose
on
the
opposite
side
a
mild
and
gentlemanly
indian
and
one
of
the
most
regarded
of
the
chiefs
he
was
in
ill
health
as
his
appearance
indicated
and
in
consequence
of
this
his
speech
was
of
a
more
pacific
character
than
it
might
otherwise
have
been
for
he
was
to
be
a
firm
opponent
of
the
removal
we
come
to
deliver
our
talk
we
are
all
made
by
the
same
great
father
and
are
all
alike
his
children
we
all
came
from
the
same
mother
and
were
suckled
at
the
same
breast
therefore
we
are
brothers
and
as
brothers
should
not
quarrel
and
let
our
blood
rise
up
against
each
other
if
the
blood
of
one
of
us
by
each
other
blow
should
fall
upon
the
earth
it
would
stain
it
and
cry
aloud
for
vengeance
from
the
land
wherever
it
had
sunk
and
call
down
the
frown
and
the
thunder
of
the
great
spirit
i
am
not
well
let
others
who
are
stronger
speak
and
declare
their
minds
several
chiefs
rose
successively
and
delivered
their
opinions
those
for

followed
the
strain
of
omatla
and
the
black
clay
they
were

big
warrior

others

an
old
refugee
from

but
now
chief
of
the
blacks
living
with
the
micosauc
tribe
note
and
one
of
the
counsellors
of
onopa
over
whom
he
held
supreme
influence
he
spoke
english
fluently
and
at
the
council
as
also
that
of
the
oclawaha
he
was
the
principal
interpreter
on
the
part
of
the
indians
he
was
a
pure
negro
with
the
thick
lips
prominent
and
other
physical
peculiarities
of
his
race
he
was
brave
cool
and
sagacious
and
though
only
an
adopted
chief
he
proved
to
the
last
the
true
friend
of
the
people
who
had
honoured
him
by
their
confidence
his
speech
was
brief
and
moderate
nevertheless
it
evinced
a
firm
determination
to
resist
the
will
of
the
agent
as
yet
the
king
had
not
declared
himself
and
to
him
the
commissioner
now
appealed
onopa
was
a
large
stout
man
of
somewhat
dull
aspect
but
not
without
a
considerable
expression
of
dignity
he
was
not
a
man
of
great
intellect
nor
yet
an
orator
and
although
the
head
mico
of
the
nation
his
influence
with
the
warriors
was
not
equal
to
that
of
several
chiefs
of
inferior
rank
his
decision
therefore
would
by
no
means
be
regarded
as
definitive
or
binding
upon
the
others
but
being
nominally
or
and
actually
head
of
the
largest
clan
the
micosaucs
his
vote
would
be
likely
to
turn
the
scale
one
way
or
the
other
if
he
declared
for
the
removal
the
patriots
might
despair
there
was
an
interval
of
breathless
silence
the
eyes
of
the
whole
assemblage
of
both
red
men
and
white
men
rested
upon
the
king
there
were
only
a
few
who
were
in
the
secret
of
his
sentiments
and
how
he
would
decide
was
to
most
of
those
present
a
matter
of
uncertainty
hence
the
anxiety
with
which
they
awaited
his
words
at
this
crisis
a
movement
was
observed
among
the
people
who
stood
behind
the
king
they
were
making
way
for
some
one
who
was
passing
through
their
midst
it
was
evidently
one
of
authority
for
the
crowd
readily
yielded
him
passage
the
moment
after
he
appeared
in
front
a
young
warrior
proudly
caparisoned
and
of
noble
aspect
he
wore
the
insignia
of
a
chief
but
it
needed
not
this
to
tell
that
he
was
one
there
was
that
in
his
look
and
bearing
which
at
once
pronounced
him
a
leader
of
men
his
dress
was
rich
without
being
frivolous
or
gay
his
tunic
embraced
by
the
bright
wampum
sash
hung
well
and
gracefully
and
the
leggings
of
scarlet
cloth
displayed
the
perfect
sweep
of
his
limbs
his
form
was
a
model
of
strength
terse
symmetrical
his
head
was
turbaned
with
a
shawl
of
brilliant
hues
and
from
the
front
rose
three
black
that
drooped
backward
over
the
crown
till
their
tips
almost
touched
his
shoulders
various
ornaments
were
suspended
from
his
neck
but
one
upon
his
breast
was
conspicuous
it
was
a
circular
plate
of
gold
with
lines
radiating
from
a
common
centre
it
was
a
representation
of
the
rising
sun
his
face
was
stained
of
a
uniform
vermilion
red
but
despite
the
levelling
effect
of
the
dye
the
lineaments
of
noble
features
could
be
traced
a
mouth
and
chin
thin
lips
a
jawbone
expressive
of
firmness
a
nose
slightly
aquiline
a
high
broad
forehead
with
eyes
that
like
the
eagle
seemed
strong
enough
to
gaze
against
the
sun
the
appearance
of
this
remarkable
man
produced
an
electric
effect
upon
all
present
it
was
similar
to
that
exhibited
by
the
audience
in
a
theatre
on
the
of
the
great
tragedian
for
whom
they
have
been
waiting
not
from
the
behaviour
of
the
young
chief
himself
withal
right
modest
but
from
the
action
of
the
others
i
perceived
that
he
was
in
reality
the
hero
of
the
hour
the
who
had
already
performed
their
parts
were
evidently
but
secondary
characters
and
this
was
the
man
for
whom
all
had
been
waiting
there
followed
a
movement
a
murmur
of
voices
an
excited
tremor
among
the
crowd
and
then
simultaneously
as
if
from
one
throat
was
shouted
the
name
osceola
note
from
its
roots
the
seminoles
make
the
a
species
of

a
sweet
and
nourishing
food
note
the
micosauc
micosaukee
or
tribe
of
the
redstick
was
the
largest
and
most
warlike
of
the
nation
it
was
under
the
immediate
government
of
the
head
chief
onopa
usually
called
miconopa
chapter
twenty
eight
the
rising
sun
yes
it
was
osceola
the
rising
sun
note
he
whose
fame
had
already
reached
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
land
whose
name
had
excited
such
an
interest
among
the
cadets
at
college
outside
the
college
in
the
streets
in
the
fashionable
everywhere
he
it
was
who
had
thus
unexpectedly
shown
himself
in
the
circle
of
chiefs
a
word
about
this
extraordinary
young
man
suddenly
emerging
from
the
condition
of
a
common
warrior
a
with
scarcely
any
following
he
had
gained
at
once
and
as
if
by
magic
the
confidence
of
the
nation
he
was
at
this
moment
the
hope
of
the
patriot
party
the
spirit
that
was
animating
them
to
resistance
and
every
day
saw
his
influence
increasing
scarcely
more
appropriate
could
have
been
his
native
appellation
one
might
have
fancied
him
less
indebted
to
accident
than
design
for
the
name
had
it
not
been
that
which
he
had
always
borne
among
his
own
people
there
was
a
sort
of
prophetic
or
typical
adaptation
in
it
for
at
this
time
he
was
in
reality
the
rising
sun
of
the
seminoles
he
was
so
regarded
by
them
i
noticed
that
his
arrival
produced
a
marked
effect
upon
the
warriors
he
may
have
been
present
upon
the
ground
all
the
day
but
up
to
that
moment
he
had
not
shown
himself
in
the
front
circle
of
the
chiefs
the
timid
and
wavering
became
reassured
by
his
appearance
and
the
traitorous
chiefs
evidently
cowered
under
his
glance
i
noticed
that
the
omatlas
and
even
the
fierce
lusta
hajo
regarded
him
with
uneasy
looks
there
were
others
besides
the
red
men
who
were
affected
by
his
sudden
advent
from
the
position
in
which
i
stood
i
had
a
view
of
the
commissioner
face
i
noticed
that
his
countenance
suddenly
paled
and
there
passed
over
it
a
marked
expression
of
chagrin
it
was
clear
that
with
him
the
rising
sun
was
anything
but
welcome
his
hurried
words
to
clinch
reached
my
ears
for
i
stood
close
to
the
general
and
could
not
help
overhearing
them
how
unfortunate
he
muttered
in
a
tone
of
vexation
but
for
him
we
should
have
succeeded
i
was
in
hopes
of
nailing
them
before
he
should
arrive
i
told
him
a
wrong
hour
but
it
seems
to
no
purpose
deuce
take
the
fellow
he
will
undo
all
see
he
is
earwigging
onopa
and
the
old
fool
listens
to
him
like
a
child
bah
he
will
obey
him
like
a
great
baby
as
he
is
it
all
up
general
we
must
come
to
blows
on
hearing
this
harangue
i
turned
my
eyes
once
more
upon
him
who
was
the
subject
of
it
and
regarded
him
more
attentively
he
was
still
standing
behind
the
king
but
in
a
stooping
attitude
and
whispering
in
the
ear
of
the
latter
scarcely
whispering
but
speaking
audibly
in
their
native
language
only
the
interpreters
could
have
understood
what
he
was
saying
and
they
were
too
distant
to
make
it
out
his
earnest
tone
however
his
firm
yet
somewhat
excited
manner
the
defiant
flash
of
his
eye
as
he
glanced
toward
the
commissioner
all
told
that
he
himself
had
no
intention
to
yield
and
that
he
was
counselling
his
superior
to
like
bold
opposition
and
resistance
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
broken
only
by
the
whisperings
of
the
commissioner
on
one
side
and
the
muttered
words
passing
between
osceola
and
the
mico
on
the
other
after
a
while
even
these
sounds
were
hushed
and
a
breathless
stillness
succeeded
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
expectation
and
one
of
peculiar
interest
on
the
words
which
onopa
was
about
to
utter
hung
events
of
high
import
important
to
almost
every
one
upon
the
ground
peace
or
war
and
therefore
life
or
death
was
suspended
over
the
heads
of
all
present
even
the
soldiers
in
the
lines
were
observed
with
outstretched
necks
in
the
attitude
of
listening
and
upon
the
other
side
the
indian
boys
and
the
women
with
babes
in
their
arms
clustered
behind
the
circle
of
warriors
their
anxious
looks
betraying
the
interest
they
felt
in
the
issue
the
commissioner
grew
impatient
his
face
reddened
again
i
saw
that
he
was
excited
and
angry
at
the
same
time
he
was
doing
his
utmost
to
appear
calm
as
yet
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
the
presence
of
osceola
but
was
making
pretence
to
ignore
it
although
it
was
evident
that
osceola
was
at
that
moment
the
main
subject
of
his
thoughts
he
only
looked
at
the
young
chief
by
now
and
again
turning
to
resume
his
conversation
with
the
general
this
was
of
short
duration
thompson
could
endure
the
suspense
no
longer
tell
onopa
said
he
to
the
interpreter
that
the
council
awaits
his
answer
the
interpreter
did
as
commanded
i
have
but
one
answer
to
make
replied
the
taciturn
king
without
deigning
to
rise
from
his
seat
i
am
content
with
my
present
home
i
am
not
going
to
leave
it
a
burst
of
applause
from
the
patriots
followed
this
declaration
perhaps
these
were
the
most
popular
words
that
old
onopa
had
ever
uttered
from
that
moment
he
was
possessed
of
real
kingly
power
and
might
command
in
his
nation
i
looked
round
the
circle
of
the
chiefs
a
smile
lit
up
the
gentlemanly
features
of
holata
mico
the
grim
face
of
gleamed
with
joy
the
alligator
cloud
and
arpiucki
exhibited
more
frantic
signs
of
their
delight
and
even
the
thick
lips
of
abram
were
drawn
flat
over
his
gums
displaying
his
double
tier
of
ivories
in
a
grin
of
triumphant
satisfaction
on
the
other
hand
the
omatlas
and
their
party
wore
black
looks
their
gloomy
glances
betokened
their
discontent
and
from
their
gestures
and
attitudes
it
was
evident
that
one
and
all
of
them
were
suffering
under
serious
apprehension
they
had
cause
they
were
no
longer
suspected
no
longer
traitors
only
attainted
their
treason
was
now
patent
it
had
been
declared
it
was
fortunate
for
them
that
fort
king
was
so
near
well
that
they
stood
in
the
presence
of
that
embattled
line
they
might
need
its
bayonets
to
protect
them
the
commissioner
had
by
this
time
lost
command
of
his
temper
even
official
dignity
gave
way
and
he
now
descended
to
angry
exclamations
threats
and
bitter
invective
in
the
last
he
was
personal
calling
the
chiefs
by
name
and
charging
them
with
faithlessness
and
falsehood
he
accused
onopa
of
having
already
signed
the
treaty
of
the
oclawaha
and
when
the
latter
denied
having
done
so
the
commissioner
told
him
he
again
historically
true
the
very
word
used
even
the
savage
did
not
reciprocate
the
vulgar
accusation
but
treated
it
with
silent
disdain
after
spending
a
portion
of
his
spleen
upon
various
chiefs
of
the
council
he
turned
towards
the
front
and
in
a
loud
angry
tone
cried
out
it
is
who
have
done
this
powell
i
started
at
the
word
i
looked
to
see
who
was
addressed
who
it
was
that
bore
that
name
the
commissioner
guided
my
glance
both
by
look
and
gesture
he
was
standing
with
arm
outstretched
and
finger
pointed
in
menace
his
eye
was
bent
upon
the
young
upon
osceola
all
at
once
a
light
broke
upon
me
already
strange
memories
had
been
playing
with
my
fancy
i
thought
that
through
the
vermilion
paint
i
saw
features
i
had
seen
before
now
i
recognised
them
in
the
young
indian
hero
i
beheld
the
friend
of
my
boyhood
the
preserver
of
my
life
the
brother
of
maumee
note
osceola
written
oceola
asseola
assula
hasseola
and
in
a
dozen
other
forms
of
orthography
in
the
seminole
language
signifies
the
rising
sun
chapter
twenty
nine
the
ultimatum
yes
powell
and
osceola
were
one
the
boy
as
i
had
predicted
now
developed
into
the
splendid
man
a
hero
under
the
impulsive
influences
of
former
friendship
and
present
admiration
i
could
have
rushed
forward
and
flung
my
arms
around
him
but
it
was
neither
time
nor
place
for
the
display
of
such
childish
enthusiasm
etiquette
duty
forbade
it
i
kept
my
ground
and
as
well
as
i
could
the
composure
of
my
countenance
though
i
was
unable
to
withdraw
my
eyes
from
what
had
now
become
doubly
an
object
of
admiration
there
was
little
time
for
reflection
the
pause
created
by
the
rude
speech
of
the
commissioner
had
passed
the
silence
was
again
broken
this
time
by
osceola
himself
the
young
chief
perceiving
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
singled
out
stepped
forth
a
pace
or
two
and
stood
confronting
the
commissioner
his
eye
fixed
upon
him
in
a
glance
mild
yet
firm
and
searching
are
you
addressing
me
he
inquired
in
a
tone
that
evinced
not
the
slightest
anger
or
excitement
who
else
than
you
replied
the
commissioner
abruptly
i
called
you
by
name
powell
my
name
is
powell
not
powell
no
answered
the
indian
raising
his
voice
to
its
loudest
pitch
and
looking
with
proud
defiance
at
the
commissioner
you
may
call
me
powell
if
you
please
general
wiley
slowly
and
with
a
sarcastic
sneer
he
pronounced
the
full
titles
of
the
agent
but
know
sir
that
i
scorn
the
white
man
baptism
i
am
an
indian
i
am
the
child
of
my
mother
note
my
name
is
osceola
the
commissioner
struggled
to
control
his
passion
the
sneer
at
his
plebeian
cognomen
stung
him
to
the
quick
for
powell
understood
enough
of
english
nomenclature
to
know
that
thompson
was
not
an
aristocratic
appellation
and
the
sarcasm
cut
keenly
he
was
angry
enough
to
have
ordered
the
instant
execution
of
osceola
had
it
been
in
his
power
but
it
was
not
three
hundred
warriors
trod
the
ground
each
grasping
his
ready
rifle
quite
a
match
for
the
troops
at
the
post
besides
the
commissioner
knew
that
such
rash
indulgence
of
spleen
might
not
be
relished
by
his
government
even
the
ringgolds
his
dear
friends
and
ready
advisers
with
all
the
wicked
interest
they
might
have
in
the
downfall
of
the
rising
sun
were
wiser
than
to
counsel
a
proceeding
like
that
instead
of
replying
therefore
to
the
taunt
of
the
young
chief
the
commissioner
addressed
himself
once
more
to
the
council
i
want
no
more
talking
said
he
with
the
air
of
a
man
speaking
to
inferiors
we
have
had
enough
already
your
talk
has
been
that
of
children
of
men
without
wisdom
or
faith
i
will
no
longer
listen
to
it
hear
then
what
your
great
father
says
and
what
he
has
sent
me
to
say
to
you
he
has
told
me
to
place
before
you
this
paper
the
speaker
produced
a
fold
of
parchment
opening
it
as
he
proceeded
it
is
the
treaty
of
oclawaha
most
of
you
have
already
signed
it
i
ask
you
now
to
step
forward
and
confirm
your
signatures
i
have
not
signed
it
said
onopa
urged
to
the
declaration
by
osceola
who
stood
by
behind
him
i
shall
not
sign
it
now
others
may
act
as
they
please
i
shall
not
go
from
my
home
i
shall
not
leave
florida
nor
i
added
in
a
determined
tone
i
have
fifty
kegs
of
powder
so
long
as
a
grain
of
it
remains
unburned
i
shall
not
be
parted
from
my
native
land
his
sentiments
are
mine
added
holata
and
mine
exclaimed
arpiucki
and
mine
echoed
poshalla
the
dwarf
coa
hajo
cloud
and
the
negro
abram
the
patriots
alone
spoke
the
traitors
said
not
a
word
the
signing
was
a
test
too
severe
for
them
they
had
all
signed
it
before
at
the
oclawaha
but
now
in
the
presence
of
the
nation
they
dared
not
confirm
it
they
feared
even
to
advocate
what
they
had
done
they
remained
silent
enough
said
osceola
who
had
not
yet
publicly
expressed
his
opinion
but
who
was
now
expected
to
speak
and
was
attentively
regarded
by
all
the
chiefs
have
declared
themselves
they
refuse
to
sign
it
is
the
voice
of
the
nation
that
speaks
through
its
chiefs
and
the
people
will
stand
by
their
word
the
agent
has
called
us
children
and
fools
it
is
easy
to
give
names
we
know
that
there
are
fools
among
us
and
children
too
and
worse
than
both
but
there
are
men
and
some
as
true
and
brave
as
the
agent
himself
he
wants
no
more
talk
with
us
be
it
so
we
have
no
more
for
he
has
our
answer
he
may
stay
or
go
brothers
continued
the
speaker
facing
to
the
chiefs
and
warriors
and
as
if
disregarding
the
presence
of
the
whites
you
have
done
right
you
have
spoken
the
will
of
the
nation
and
the
people
applaud
it
is
false
that
we
wish
to
leave
our
homes
and
go
west
they
who
say
so
are
deceivers
and
do
not
speak
our
mind
we
have
no
desire
for
this
to
which
they
would
send
us
it
is
not
as
fair
as
our
own
it
is
a
wild
desert
where
in
summer
the
springs
dry
up
and
water
is
hard
to
find
from
thirst
the
hunter
often
dies
by
the
way
in
winter
the
leaves
fall
from
the
trees
snow
covers
the
ground
frost
stiffens
the
clay
and
chills
the
bodies
of
men
till
they
shiver
in
pain
the
whole
country
looks
as
though
the
earth
were
dead
brothers
we
want
no
cold
country
like
that
we
like
our
own
land
better
if
it
be
too
hot
we
have
the
shade
of
the
the
big
laurel
note
and
the
noble
shall
we
forsake
the
land
of
the
palm
no
under
its
shadow
have
we
lived
under
its
shadow
let
us
die
up
to
this
point
the
interest
had
been
increasing
indeed
ever
since
the
appearance
of
osceola
the
scene
had
been
deeply
impressive
never
to
be
effaced
from
the
memory
though
difficult
to
be
described
in
words
a
painter
and
he
alone
might
have
done
justice
to
such
a
picture
it
was
full
of
points
thoroughly
and
thrillingly
dramatic
the
excited
agent
on
one
side
the
calm
chiefs
on
the
other
the
contrast
of
emotions
the
very
women
who
had
left
their
unclad
little
ones
to
gambol
on
the
grass
and
dally
with
the
flowers
while
they
themselves
with
the
warriors
pressed
closely
around
the
council
under
the
most
intense
yet
subdued
interest
catching
every
look
as
it
gleamed
from
the
countenance
and
hanging
on
every
word
as
it
fell
from
the
lips
of
osceola
the
latter
his
eye
calm
serious
fixed
his
attitude
manly
graceful
erect
his
thin
lip
indicative
of
the
mind
made
up
his
firm
yet
restrained
tread
free
from
all
stride
or
swagger
his
dignified
and
composed
bearing
his
perfect
and
solemn
silence
except
during
his
sententious
talk
the
head
thrown
backward
the
arms
firmly
folded
on
the
protruding
chest
all
all
instantaneously
changing
as
if
by
an
electric
shock
whenever
the
commissioner
stated
a
proposition
that
he
knew
to
be
false
or
sophistic
at
such
times
the
of
his
indignant
eye
the
withering
scorn
upon
his
upcurled
lip
the
violent
and
oft
repeated
stamping
of
his
foot
his
clenched
hand
and
the
rapid
gesticulation
of
his
uplifted
arm
the
short
quick
breathing
and
heaving
of
his
agitated
bosom
like
the
rushing
wind
and
swelling
wave
of
the
ocean
and
these
again
subsiding
into
the
stillness
of
melancholy
and
presenting
only
that
aspect
and
attitude
of
repose
wherewith
the
ancient
statuary
loved
to
invest
the
gods
and
heroes
of
greece
the
speech
of
osceola
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
the
patience
was
exhausted
the
time
was
ripe
to
deliver
the
dire
threat
the
ultimatum
with
which
the
president
had
armed
him
and
not
bating
one
jot
of
his
rude
manner
he
pronounced
the
infamous
menace
you
will
not
sign
you
will
not
consent
to
go
i
say
then
you
war
will
be
declared
against
you
troops
will
enter
your
land
you
will
be
forced
from
it
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
indeed
exclaimed
osceola
with
a
derisive
laugh
then
be
it
so
he
continued
let
war
be
declared
though
we
love
peace
we
fear
not
war
we
know
your
strength
your
people
outnumber
us
by
millions
but
were
there
as
many
more
of
them
they
will
not
compel
us
to
submit
to
injustice
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
endure
death
before
dishonour
let
war
be
declared
send
your
troops
into
our
land
perhaps
they
will
not
force
us
from
it
so
easily
as
you
imagine
to
your
muskets
we
will
oppose
our
rifles
to
your
bayonets
our
tomahawks
and
your
starched
soldiers
will
be
met
face
to
face
by
the
warriors
of
the
seminole
let
war
be
declared
we
are
ready
for
its
tempest
the
hail
may
rattle
and
the
flowers
be
crushed
but
the
strong
oak
of
the
forest
will
lift
its
head
to
the
sky
and
the
storm
towering
and
unscathed
a
yell
of
defiance
burst
from
the
indian
warriors
at
the
conclusion
of
this
stirring
speech
and
the
disturbed
council
threatened
a
disruption
several
of
the
chiefs
excited
by
the
appeal
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
stood
with
lowering
looks
and
arms
stretched
forth
in
firm
angry
menace
the
officers
of
the
line
had
glided
to
their
places
and
in
an
undertone
ordered
the
troops
into
an
attitude
of
readiness
while
the
artillerists
on
the
bastions
of
the
fort
were
seen
by
their
guns
while
the
tiny
wreath
of
blue
smoke
told
that
the
fuse
had
been
kindled
for
all
this
there
was
no
danger
of
an
outbreak
neither
party
was
prepared
for
a
collision
at
that
moment
the
indians
had
come
to
the
council
with
no
hostile
designs
else
they
would
have
left
their
wives
and
children
at
home
with
them
by
their
sides
they
would
not
dream
of
making
an
attack
and
their
white
adversaries
dared
not
without
better
pretext
the
demonstration
was
only
the
result
of
a
momentary
excitement
and
soon
subsided
to
a
calm
the
commissioner
had
stretched
his
influence
to
its
utmost
his
threats
were
now
disregarded
as
had
been
his
wheedling
appeal
and
he
saw
that
he
had
no
longer
the
power
to
effect
his
cherished
purpose
but
there
was
still
hope
in
time
there
were
wiser
heads
than
his
upon
the
ground
who
saw
this
the
sagacious
veteran
clinch
and
the
crafty
ringgolds
saw
it
these
now
gathered
around
the
agent
and
counselled
him
to
the
adoption
of
a
different
course
give
them
time
to
consider
suggested
they
appoint
for
another
meeting
let
the
chiefs
discuss
the
matter
among
themselves
in
private
council
and
not
as
now
in
presence
of
the
people
on
calmer
reflection
and
when
not
intimidated
by
the
crowd
of
warriors
they
may
decide
differently
particularly
now
that
they
know
the
alternative
and
perhaps
added
arens
ringgold
who
to
other
bad
qualities
added
that
of
a
crafty
diplomatist
perhaps
the
more
hostile
of
them
will
not
stay
for
the
council
of
you
do
not
want
their
signatures
right
replied
the
commissioner
catching
at
the
idea
right
it
shall
be
done
and
with
this
laconic
promise
he
faced
once
more
to
the
council
of
chiefs
brothers
he
said
resuming
the
tone
in
which
he
had
first
addressed
them
for
as
the
brave
chief
holata
has
said
we
are
all
brothers
why
then
should
we
separate
in
anger
your
great
father
would
be
sad
to
hear
that
we
had
so
parted
from
one
another
i
do
not
wish
you
hastily
to
decide
upon
this
important
matter
return
to
your
tents
hold
your
own
councils
discuss
the
matter
freely
and
fairly
among
yourselves
and
let
us
meet
again
the
loss
of
a
day
will
not
signify
to
either
of
us
will
be
time
enough
to
give
your
decision
till
then
let
us
be
friends
and
brothers
to
this
harangue
several
of
the
chiefs
replied
they
said
it
was
good
talk
and
they
would
agree
to
it
and
then
all
arose
to
depart
from
the
ground
i
noticed
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
replies
the
chiefs
were
not
unanimous
in
their
assent
those
who
agreed
were
principally
of
the
omatla
party
but
i
could
hear
some
of
the
hostile
warriors
as
they
strode
away
from
the
ground
declare
aloud
their
intention
to
return
no
more
note
the
child
follows
the
fortunes
of
the
mother
the
usage
is
not
seminole
only
but
the
same
with
all
the
indians
of
america
note
so
styled
in
the
language
of
the
indians
chapter
thirty
talk
over
the
table
over
the
i
gathered
much
knowledge
men
talk
freely
while
the
wine
is
flowing
and
under
the
influence
of
champagne
the
wisest
grow
voluble
the
commissioner
made
little
secret
either
of
his
own
designs
or
the
views
of
the
president
but
most
already
guessed
them
he
was
somewhat
gloomed
at
the
manner
in
which
the
day
proceedings
had
ended
and
by
the
reflection
that
his
diplomatic
fame
would
suffer
a
fame
ardently
aspired
to
by
all
agents
of
the
united
states
government
personal
slights
too
had
he
received
from
osceola
and
others
for
the
calm
cold
indian
holds
in
scorn
the
man
of
hasty
temper
and
this
weakness
had
he
displayed
to
their
derision
throughout
the
day
he
felt
defeated
humiliated
resentful
against
the
men
of
red
skin
on
the
morrow
he
flattered
himself
that
he
would
make
them
feel
the
power
of
his
resentment
teach
them
that
if
passionate
he
was
also
firm
and
daring
as
the
wine
warmed
him
he
said
as
much
in
a
half
boasting
way
he
became
more
reckless
and
jovial
as
for
the
military
officers
they
cared
little
for
the
points
of
the
case
and
took
not
much
part
in
the
discussion
of
its
merits
their
speculations
ran
upon
the
probability
of
strife
war
or
no
war
that
was
the
question
of
absorbing
interest
to
the
men
of
the
sword
i
heard
much
boasting
of
superiority
and
decrying
of
the
strength
and
the
courage
of
the
prospective
enemy
but
to
this
there
were
dissentient
opinions
expressed
by
a
few
old
indian
fighters
who
were
of
the
mess
it
is
needless
to
say
that
oceola
character
was
commented
upon
and
about
the
young
chief
opinions
were
as
different
as
vice
from
virtue
with
some
he
was
the
noble
savage
he
seemed
but
i
was
astonished
to
find
the
majority
dissent
from
this
view
drunken
savage
cattle
thief
impostor
and
appellations
were
freely
bestowed
upon
him
i
grew
irate
i
could
not
credit
these
accusations
i
observed
that
most
of
those
who
made
them
were
comparative
strangers
new
comers
to
the
country
who
could
not
know
much
of
the
past
life
of
him
with
whose
name
they
were
making
so
free
the
ringgolds
joined
in
the
calumny
and
they
must
have
known
him
well
but
i
comprehended
motives
i
felt
that
i
owed
the
subject
of
the
conversation
a
word
of
defence
for
two
reasons
he
was
absent
he
had
saved
my
life
despite
the
grandeur
of
the
company
i
could
not
restrain
my
tongue
gentlemen
i
said
speaking
loud
enough
to
call
the
attention
of
the
talkers
can
any
of
you
prove
these
accusations
against
osceola
the
challenge
produced
an
awkward
silence
no
one
could
exactly
prove
either
the
drunkenness
the
or
the
imposture
ha
at
length
ejaculated
arens
ringgold
in
his
shrill
squeaky
voice
you
are
his
defender
are
you
lieutenant
randolph
until
i
hear
better
evidence
than
mere
assertion
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
defence
oh
that
may
be
easily
obtained
cried
one
everybody
knows
what
the
fellow
is
and
has
been
a
regular
for
years
you
are
mistaken
there
i
replied
to
this
confident
speaker
i
do
not
know
it
do
you
sir
not
from
personal
experience
i
admit
said
the
accuser
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
interrogation
since
you
are
upon
the
subject
of
gentlemen
i
may
inform
you
that
i
met
with
a
rare
incident
only
yesterday
connected
with
the
matter
if
you
will
permit
me
i
shall
relate
it
oh
certainly
by
all
means
let
us
have
it
being
a
stranger
i
was
indulged
with
a
patient
hearing
i
related
the
episode
of
lawyer
grubb
cattle
omitting
names
it
created
some
sensation
i
saw
that
the
was
impressed
with
it
while
the
commissioner
looked
vexed
as
if
he
would
rather
i
had
held
my
tongue
but
the
strongest
effect
was
produced
upon
the
ringgolds
father
and
son
both
appeared
pale
and
uneasy
perhaps
no
one
noticed
this
except
myself
but
i
observed
it
with
sufficient
distinctness
to
be
left
under
the
full
impression
that
both
knew
more
of
the
matter
than
i
myself
the
conversation
next
turned
upon
runaways
upon
the
number
of
negroes
there
might
be
among
the
tribes
upon
the
influence
they
would
exert
against
us
in
case
of
a
conflict
these
were
topics
of
serious
importance
it
was
there
were
large
numbers
of
black
and
yellow
men
located
in
the
reserve
some
as
agriculturists
some
graziers
not
a
few
wandering
through
the
savannas
and
forests
rifle
in
hand
having
adopted
the
true
style
of
indian
the
speakers
estimated
their
numbers
variously
the
lowest
put
them
at
while
some
raised
their
figure
to
a
these
would
be
against
us
to
a
there
was
no
dissent
to
that
proposition
some
alleged
they
would
fight
badly
others
bravely
and
these
spoke
with
more
reason
all
agreed
that
they
would
greatly
aid
the
enemy
and
give
us
trouble
and
a
few
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
had
more
to
fear
from
the
black
runaways
than
the
red
runaways
in
this
expression
there
was
a
latent
jest
the
seminoles
were
originally
of
the
great
tribe
of
muscogees
creeks
seceding
from
these
for
reasons
not
known
the
seminoles
passed
southward
into
florida
and
obtained
from
their
former
kindred
the
name
they
now
bear
which
in
their
own
tongue
has
the
signification
of
runaway
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
negroes
would
take
up
arms
in
the
pending
struggle
and
no
more
that
they
would
act
with
efficiency
against
us
their
knowledge
of
the
white
man
ways
would
enable
them
to
do
so
besides
the
negro
is
no
coward
their
courage
has
been
ofttimes
proved
place
him
in
front
of
a
enemy
a
thing
of
flesh
bone
and
blood
armed
with
gun
and
bayonet
and
the
negro
is
not
the
man
to
flinch
it
is
otherwise
if
the
foe
be
not
physical
but
belonging
to
the
world
of
obeah
in
the
soul
of
the
unenlightened
child
of
afric
superstition
is
strong
indeed
he
lives
in
a
world
of
ghosts
ghouls
and
goblins
and
his
dread
of
these
supernatural
spirits
is
real
cowardice
as
the
conversation
continued
on
the
subject
of
the
blacks
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
strong
animus
that
actuated
the
speakers
especially
the
planters
in
the
civilian
garb
some
waxed
indignant
even
wroth
to
vulgarity
threatening
all
sorts
of
punishment
to
such
runaways
as
might
be
captured
they
gloated
over
the
prospect
of
restoration
but
as
much
at
the
idea
of
a
not
distant
revenge
shooting
hanging
burning
were
all
spoken
of
besides
a
variety
of
other
tortures
peculiar
to
this
southern
land
rare
punishments
no
lack
of
them
were
promised
in
a
breath
to
the
unfortunate
absconder
who
should
chance
to
get
caught
you
who
live
far
away
from
such
sentiments
can
but
ill
comprehend
the
moral
relations
of
caste
and
colour
under
ordinary
circumstances
there
exists
between
white
and
black
no
feeling
of
hostility
quite
the
contrary
the
white
man
is
rather
kindly
disposed
towards
his
coloured
but
only
so
long
as
the
latter
opposes
not
his
will
let
the
black
but
offer
resistance
even
in
the
slightest
degree
and
then
hostility
is
quickly
kindled
justice
and
mercy
are
alike
disregarded
vengeance
is
only
felt
this
is
a
general
truth
it
will
apply
to
every
one
who
owns
a
slave
exceptionally
the
relation
is
worse
there
are
white
my
in
the
southern
states
who
hold
the
life
of
a
black
at
but
slight
value
just
the
value
of
his
market
price
an
incident
in
the
history
of
young
ringgold
helps
me
to
an
illustration
but
the
day
before
my
squire
black
jake
had
given
me
the
story
this
youth
with
some
other
boys
of
his
acquaintance
and
of
like
dissolute
character
was
hunting
in
the
forest
the
hounds
had
passed
beyond
hearing
and
no
one
could
tell
the
direction
they
had
taken
it
was
useless
riding
further
and
the
party
halted
leaped
from
their
saddles
and
tied
their
horses
to
the
trees
for
a
long
time
the
baying
of
the
beagles
was
not
heard
and
the
time
hung
heavily
on
the
hands
of
the
hunters
how
were
they
to
pass
it
a
negro
boy
chanced
to
be
near
chopping
wood
they
knew
the
boy
well
enough
one
of
the
slaves
on
a
neighbouring
plantation
let
us
have
some
sport
with
the
darkie
suggested
one
what
sport
let
us
hang
him
for
sport
the
proposal
of
course
produced
a
general
laugh
joking
apart
said
the
first
speaker
i
should
really
like
to
try
how
much
hanging
a
nigger
bear
without
being
killed
outright
so
should
i
rejoined
a
second
and
so
i
too
added
a
third
the
idea
took
the
experiment
promised
to
amuse
them
well
then
let
us
make
trial
that
the
best
way
to
settle
the
point
the
trial
made
i
am
relating
a
the
unfortunate
boy
was
seized
upon
a
noose
was
adjusted
round
his
neck
and
he
was
triced
up
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
just
at
that
instant
a
stag
broke
past
with
the
hounds
in
full
cry
the
hunters
ran
to
their
horses
and
in
the
excitement
forgot
to
cut
down
the
victim
of
their
deviltry
one
left
the
duty
to
another
and
all
neglected
it
when
the
chase
was
ended
they
returned
to
the
spot
the
negro
was
still
hanging
from
the
branch
he
was
dead
there
was
a
trial
the
mere
mockery
of
a
trial
both
judge
and
jury
were
the
relatives
of
the
criminals
and
the
sentence
was
that
the
negro
be
paid
the
owner
of
the
slave
was
contented
with
the
price
justice
was
satisfied
or
supposed
to
be
and
jake
had
heard
hundreds
of
white
christians
knew
the
tale
to
be
laughing
at
it
as
a
capital
joke
as
such
arens
ringgold
was
often
in
the
habit
of
detailing
it
you
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
hold
up
your
hands
and
cry
horror
you
live
in
the
fancy
you
have
no
slaves
no
cruelties
like
this
you
are
sadly
in
error
i
have
detailed
an
exceptional
case
an
individual
victim
land
of
the
workhouse
and
the
jail
your
victims
are
legion
smiling
christian
you
parade
your
compassion
but
you
have
made
the
misery
that
calls
it
forth
you
abet
with
easy
concurrence
the
that
begets
all
this
suffering
and
although
you
may
soothe
your
spirit
by
assigning
crime
and
poverty
to
nature
will
not
be
impugned
with
impunity
in
vain
may
you
endeavour
to
shirk
your
individual
responsibility
for
every
cry
and
canker
you
will
be
held
responsible
in
the
sight
of
god
the
conversation
about
runaways
naturally
guided
my
thoughts
to
the
other
and
more
mysterious
adventure
of
yesterday
having
dropped
a
hint
about
this
incident
i
was
called
upon
to
relate
it
in
detail
i
did
so
of
course
scouting
the
idea
that
my
intended
assassin
could
have
been
yellow
jake
a
good
many
of
those
present
knew
the
story
of
the
mulatto
and
the
circumstances
connected
with
his
death
why
was
it
when
i
mentioned
his
name
coupled
with
the
solemn
declaration
of
my
sable
groom
why
was
it
that
arens
ringgold
started
turned
pale
and
whispered
some
words
in
the
ear
of
his
father
chapter
thirty
one
the
traitor
chiefs
soon
after
i
retired
from
the
and
strolled
out
into
the
stockade
it
was
now
after
sunset
orders
had
been
issued
for
no
one
to
leave
the
fort
but
translating
these
as
only
applicable
to
the
common
soldier
i
resolved
to
sally
forth
i
was
guided
by
an
impulse
of
the
heart
in
the
indian
camp
were
the
wives
of
the
chiefs
and
warriors
their
sisters
and
children
why
not
she
among
the
rest
i
had
a
belief
that
she
was
there
although
during
all
that
day
my
eyes
had
been
wandering
in
vain
search
she
was
not
among
those
who
had
crowded
around
the
council
not
a
face
had
escaped
my
scrutiny
i
resolved
to
seek
the
seminole
camp
to
go
among
the
tents
of
the
micosaucs
there
in
all
likelihood
i
should
find
powell
there
i
should
meet
with
maumee
there
would
be
no
danger
in
entering
the
indian
camp
even
the
hostile
chiefs
were
yet
in
relations
of
friendship
with
us
and
surely
powell
was
still
friend
he
could
protect
me
from
peril
or
insults
i
felt
a
longing
to
grasp
the
hand
of
the
young
warrior
that
of
itself
would
have
influenced
me
to
seek
the
interview
i
yearned
to
renew
the
friendly
confidence
of
the
past
to
talk
over
those
pleasant
times
to
recall
those
scenes
of
halcyon
brightness
surely
the
sterner
duties
of
the
chief
and
had
not
yet
indurated
a
heart
once
mild
and
amiable
no
doubt
the
spirit
of
my
former
friend
was
embittered
by
the
white
man
injustice
no
doubt
i
should
find
him
rancorous
against
our
race
he
had
reason
still
i
had
no
fears
that
i
myself
was
not
an
exception
to
this
wholesale
resentment
whatever
the
result
i
resolved
to
seek
him
and
once
more
extend
to
him
the
hand
of
friendship
i
was
on
the
eve
of
setting
forth
when
a
summons
from
the
called
me
to
his
quarters
with
some
chagrin
i
obeyed
the
order
i
found
the
commissioner
there
with
the
officers
of
higher
rank
the
ringgolds
and
several
other
civilians
of
distinction
on
entering
i
perceived
that
they
were
in
caucus
and
had
just
ended
the
discussion
of
some
plan
of
procedure
the
design
is
excellent
observed
general
clinch
addressing
himself
to
the
others
but
how
are
omatla
and
dirt
note
to
be
met
if
we
summon
them
hither
it
may
create
suspicion
they
could
not
enter
the
fort
without
being
observed
general
clinch
said
the
elder
ringgold
the
most
cunning
diplomatist
of
the
party
if
you
and
general
thompson
were
to
meet
the
friendly
chiefs
outside
exactly
so
interrupted
the
commissioner
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
i
have
sent
a
messenger
to
omatla
to
inquire
if
he
can
give
us
a
secret
meeting
it
will
be
best
to
see
them
outside
the
man
has
returned
i
hear
him
at
this
moment
a
person
entered
the
room
whom
i
recognised
as
one
of
the
interpreters
who
had
officiated
at
the
council
he
whispered
something
to
the
commissioner
and
then
withdrew
all
right
gentlemen
exclaimed
the
latter
as
the
interpreter
went
out
omatla
will
meet
us
within
the
hour
black
dirt
will
be
with
him
they
have
named
the
as
the
place
it
lies
to
the
north
of
the
fort
we
can
reach
it
without
passing
the
camp
and
there
will
be
no
risk
of
our
being
observed
shall
we
go
general
i
am
ready
replied
clinch
taking
up
his
cloak
and
throwing
it
over
his
shoulders
but
general
thompson
said
he
turning
to
the
commissioner
how
about
your
interpreters
can
they
be
intrusted
with
a
secret
of
so
much
importance
the
commissioner
appeared
to
hesitate
it
might
be
imprudent
he
replied
at
length
in
a
half
soliloquy
never
mind
then
never
mind
said
clinch
i
think
we
can
do
without
them
lieutenant
randolph
continued
he
turning
to
me
you
speak
the
seminole
tongue
fluently
not
fluently
general
i
speak
it
however
you
could
interpret
it
fairly
yes
general
i
believe
so
very
well
then
that
will
do
come
with
us
smothering
my
vexation
at
being
thus
diverted
from
my
design
i
followed
in
silence
the
commissioner
leading
the
way
while
the
general
disguised
in
cloak
and
plain
forage
cap
walked
by
his
side
we
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
turned
northward
around
the
stockade
the
tents
of
the
indians
were
upon
the
southwest
placed
irregularly
along
the
edge
of
a
broad
belt
of
hommocky
woods
that
extended
in
that
direction
another
tract
of
hommock
lay
to
the
north
separated
from
the
larger
one
by
savannas
and
open
forests
of
pine
timber
here
was
the
sink
it
was
nearly
half
a
mile
distant
from
the
stockade
but
in
the
darkness
we
could
easily
reach
it
without
being
observed
from
any
part
of
the
seminole
camp
we
soon
arrived
upon
the
ground
the
chiefs
were
before
us
we
found
them
standing
under
the
shadows
of
the
trees
by
the
edge
of
the
pond
my
duty
now
began
i
had
little
anticipation
that
it
was
to
have
been
so
disagreeable
ask
omatla
what
is
the
number
of
his
people
also
those
of
black
dirt
and
the
other
chiefs
who
are
for
us
i
put
the
question
as
commanded
of
the
whole
seminole
nation
was
the
ready
reply
tell
them
that
ten
thousand
dollars
shall
be
given
to
the
friendly
chiefs
on
their
arrival
in
the
west
to
be
shared
among
them
as
they
deem
best
that
this
sum
is
independent
of
the
appropriation
to
the
whole
tribe
it
is
good
simultaneously
grunted
the
chiefs
when
the
proposition
was
explained
to
them
does
omatla
and
his
friends
think
that
all
the
chiefs
will
be
present
no
not
all
which
of
them
are
likely
to
be
absent
the
will
not
be
there
ha
is
omatla
sure
of
that
sure
onopa
tents
are
struck
he
has
already
left
the
ground
whither
has
he
gone
back
to
his
town
and
his
people
most
of
them
gone
with
him
for
some
moments
the
two
generals
communicated
together
in
a
half
whisper
they
were
apart
from
me
i
did
not
not
hear
what
they
said
the
information
just
acquired
was
of
great
importance
and
seemed
not
to
discontent
them
any
other
chief
likely
to
be
absent
they
asked
after
a
pause
only
those
of
the
tribe
of
note
no
he
is
here
he
will
remain
ask
them
if
they
think
will
be
at
the
council
from
the
eagerness
with
which
the
answer
was
expected
i
could
perceive
that
this
was
the
most
interesting
question
of
all
i
put
it
directly
what
exclaimed
the
chiefs
as
if
astonished
at
the
interrogatory
the
rising
sun
he
is
sure
to
be
present
he
will
it
good
involuntarily
ejaculated
the
commissioner
and
then
turning
to
the
general
he
once
more
addressed
him
in
a
low
tone
this
time
i
overheard
what
passed
between
them
it
seems
general
as
if
providence
was
playing
into
our
hands
my
plan
is
almost
sure
to
succeed
a
word
will
provoke
the
impudent
rascal
to
some
rudeness
perhaps
worse
at
all
events
i
shall
easily
fix
a
pretext
for
shutting
him
up
now
that
onopa
has
drawn
off
his
following
we
will
be
strong
enough
for
any
contingency
the
hostiles
will
scarcely
outnumber
the
friendly
so
that
there
will
no
chance
of
the
rascals
making
resistance
oh
that
we
need
not
fear
well
with
once
in
our
power
the
opposition
will
be
crushed
the
rest
will
yield
easily
for
beyond
doubt
it
is
he
that
now
intimidates
and
hinders
them
from
signing
true
replied
clinch
in
a
reflective
tone
but
how
about
the
government
eh
will
it
endorse
the
act
think
you
it
will
it
must
my
latest
dispatch
from
the
president
almost
suggests
as
much
if
you
agree
to
act
i
shall
take
the
risk
oh
i
place
myself
under
your
orders
replied
the
evidently
inclined
to
the
commissioner
views
but
still
not
willing
to
share
the
responsibility
it
is
but
my
duty
to
carry
out
the
will
of
the
executive
i
am
ready
to
cooperate
with
you
enough
then
it
shall
be
done
as
we
have
designed
it
ask
the
chiefs
continued
the
speaker
addressing
himself
to
me
ask
them
if
they
have
any
fear
of
signing
no
not
of
the
signing
but
and
what
afterwards
they
dread
an
attack
from
the
hostile
party
their
lives
will
be
in
danger
what
would
they
have
us
do
omatla
says
if
you
will
permit
him
and
the
other
head
chiefs
to
go
on
a
visit
to
their
friends
at
tallahassee
it
will
keep
them
out
of
danger
they
can
stay
there
till
the
removal
is
about
to
take
place
they
give
their
promise
that
they
will
meet
you
at
tampa
or
elsewhere
whenever
you
summon
them
the
two
generals
consulted
together
once
more
in
whispers
this
unexpected
proposal
required
consideration
omatla
added
if
we
are
not
allowed
to
go
to
tallahassee
we
can
not
we
dare
not
stay
at
home
we
must
come
under
the
protection
of
the
fort
about
your
going
to
tallahassee
replied
the
commissioner
we
shall
consider
it
and
give
you
an
answer
meanwhile
you
need
not
be
under
any
apprehension
this
is
the
of
the
whites
he
will
protect
you
yes
said
clinch
drawing
himself
proudly
up
my
warriors
are
numerous
and
strong
there
are
many
in
the
fort
and
many
more
on
the
way
you
have
nothing
to
fear
it
is
good
rejoined
the
chiefs
if
troubles
arise
we
shall
seek
your
protection
you
have
promised
it
it
is
good
ask
the
chiefs
said
the
commissioner
to
whom
a
new
question
had
suggested
itself
ask
them
if
they
know
whether
holata
mico
will
remain
for
the
council
of
we
can
not
tell
now
holata
mico
has
not
declared
his
intention
we
shall
soon
know
it
if
he
designs
to
stay
his
tents
will
stand
till
the
rising
of
the
sun
if
not
they
will
be
struck
before
the
moon
goes
down
the
moon
is
sinking
we
shall
soon
know
whether
holata
mico
will
go
or
stay
the
tents
of
this
chief
are
not
within
sight
of
the
fort
no
they
are
back
among
the
trees
can
you
send
word
to
us
yes
but
only
to
this
place
our
messenger
would
be
seen
entering
the
fort
we
can
come
back
here
ourselves
and
meet
one
from
you
true
it
is
better
so
replied
the
commissioner
apparently
pleased
with
the
arrangement
a
few
minutes
passed
during
which
the
two
generals
communicated
with
each
other
in
while
whispers
the
chiefs
stood
apart
silent
and
immobile
as
a
pair
of
statues
the
at
length
broke
the
silence
lieutenant
you
will
remain
upon
the
ground
till
the
chiefs
return
get
their
report
and
bring
it
direct
to
my
quarters
salutations
were
exchanged
the
two
generals
walked
off
on
the
path
that
led
to
the
fort
while
the
chiefs
glided
silently
away
in
the
opposite
direction
i
was
left
alone
note
so
lusta
hajo
was
called
by
the
americans
his
full
name
was
which
signifies
black
crazy
clay
note
a
name
given
to
the
micosaucs
from
their
custom
of
setting
up
red
poles
in
front
of
their
houses
when
going
to
war
a
similar
custom
exists
among
other
tribes
hence
the
name
baton
rouge
applied
by
the
french
colonists
chapter
thirty
two
shadows
in
the
water
alone
with
my
thoughts
and
these
tainted
with
considerable
acerbity
more
than
one
cause
contributed
to
their
bitterness
my
pleasant
purpose
thwarted
my
heart
aching
for
knowledge
for
a
renewal
of
tender
ties
distracted
with
doubts
wearied
with
protracted
suspense
in
addition
to
these
my
mind
was
harassed
by
other
emotions
i
experienced
disgust
at
the
part
i
had
been
playing
i
had
been
made
the
of
chicanery
and
wrong
aiding
conspiracy
had
been
the
first
act
of
my
warlike
career
and
although
it
was
not
the
act
of
my
own
will
i
felt
the
disagreeableness
of
the
duty
a
sheer
disgust
in
its
performance
even
the
loveliness
of
the
night
failed
to
soothe
me
its
effect
was
contrary
a
storm
would
have
been
more
congenial
to
my
spirit
and
it
was
a
lovely
night
both
the
earth
and
the
air
were
at
peace
here
and
there
the
sky
was
fleeced
with
white
cirrhi
but
so
thinly
that
the
moon
disk
passing
behind
them
appeared
to
move
under
a
transparent
of
silver
without
losing
one
ray
of
her
effulgence
her
light
was
resplendent
in
the
extreme
and
glancing
from
the
glabrous
leaves
of
the
great
laurels
caused
the
forests
to
sparkle
as
though
beset
with
a
million
of
mirrors
to
add
to
the
effect
swarmed
under
the
shadows
of
the
trees
their
bodies
lighting
up
the
dark
aisles
with
a
mingled
coruscation
of
red
blue
and
gold
now
flitting
in
a
direct
line
now
curving
or
waving
upward
and
downward
as
though
moving
through
the
mazes
of
some
intricate
in
the
midst
of
all
this
glittering
array
lay
the
little
tarn
shining
too
but
with
the
gleam
of
plated
glass
a
mirror
in
its
framework
of
fretted
gild
the
atmosphere
was
redolent
of
the
most
agreeable
perfumes
the
night
was
cool
enough
for
human
comfort
but
not
chill
many
of
the
flowers
refused
to
close
their
corollas
for
not
all
of
them
were
brides
of
the
sun
the
moon
had
its
share
of
the
sweets
the
sassafras
and
were
in
blossom
and
dispensed
their
odours
around
that
mingling
with
the
aroma
of
the
aniseed
and
the
orange
created
a
delicious
fragrance
in
the
air
there
was
a
stillness
in
the
atmosphere
but
not
silence
it
is
never
silent
in
the
southern
forests
by
night
and
cicadas
utter
their
shrillest
notes
after
the
sun
has
gone
out
of
sight
and
there
is
a
bird
that
makes
choice
melody
during
the
moonlight
hours
the
famed
mimic
of
the
american
woods
one
perched
upon
a
tall
tree
that
grew
over
the
edge
of
the
pond
appeared
trying
to
soothe
my
chafed
spirit
with
his
sweet
notes
i
heard
other
sounds
the
hum
of
the
soldiery
in
the
fort
mingling
with
the
more
distant
noises
from
the
indian
camp
now
and
then
some
voice
louder
than
the
rest
in
oath
exclamation
or
laughter
broke
forth
to
interrupt
the
monotonous
murmur
how
long
should
i
have
to
wait
the
return
of
the
chiefs
it
might
be
an
hour
or
two
hours
or
more
i
had
a
partial
guide
in
the
moon
they
said
that
holata
would
depart
before
the
shining
orb
went
down
or
not
at
all
about
two
hours
then
would
decide
the
point
and
set
me
free
i
had
been
standing
for
half
the
day
i
cared
not
to
keep
my
feet
any
longer
and
choosing
a
fragment
of
rock
near
the
water
edge
i
sat
down
upon
it
my
eyes
wandered
over
the
pond
half
of
its
surface
lay
in
shadow
the
other
half
was
silvered
by
the
moonbeams
that
penetrating
the
pellucid
water
rendered
visible
the
white
shells
and
shining
pebbles
at
the
bottom
along
the
line
where
the
light
and
darkness
met
were
outlined
several
noble
palms
whose
tall
stems
and
crested
crowns
appeared
stretching
towards
the
nadir
of
the
earth
as
though
they
belonged
to
another
and
a
brighter
firmament
beneath
my
feet
the
trees
of
which
these
were
but
the
illusory
images
grew
upon
the
summit
of
a
ridge
which
trending
along
the
western
side
of
the
pond
intercepted
the
rays
of
the
moon
i
sat
for
some
time
gazing
into
this
counterpart
of
heaven
canopy
with
my
eyes
mechanically
tracing
the
great
fronds
all
at
once
i
was
startled
at
perceiving
a
new
image
upon
the
aqueous
reflector
a
form
or
rather
the
shadow
of
one
suddenly
appeared
among
the
trunks
of
the
palms
it
was
upright
and
evidently
human
though
of
magnified
proportions
beyond
a
doubt
a
human
figure
yet
not
that
of
a
man
the
small
head
apparently
uncovered
the
gentle
rounding
of
the
shoulders
the
soft
undulation
of
the
waist
and
the
long
loose
draping
which
reached
nearly
to
the
ground
convinced
me
that
the
shadow
was
that
of
a
woman
when
i
first
observed
it
it
was
moving
among
the
stems
of
the
presently
it
stopped
and
for
some
seconds
remained
in
a
fixed
attitude
it
was
then
i
noted
the
peculiarities
that
distinguish
the
sex
my
first
impulse
was
to
turn
round
and
if
possible
get
a
sight
of
the
figure
that
cast
this
interesting
shadow
i
was
myself
on
the
western
edge
of
the
pond
and
the
ridge
was
behind
me
facing
round
i
could
not
see
the
summit
nor
yet
the
palms
rising
to
my
feet
i
still
could
not
see
them
a
large
under
which
i
had
seated
myself
intercepting
my
view
i
stepped
hastily
to
one
side
and
then
both
the
outline
of
the
ridge
and
the
were
before
my
eyes
but
i
could
see
no
figure
neither
of
man
nor
woman
i
scanned
the
summit
carefully
but
no
living
thing
was
there
some
fronds
of
the
standing
along
the
crest
were
the
only
forms
i
could
perceive
i
returned
to
where
i
had
been
seated
and
placing
myself
as
before
again
looked
upon
the
water
the
palm
shadows
were
there
just
as
i
had
left
them
but
the
image
was
gone
there
was
nothing
to
be
astonished
at
i
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
myself
under
any
delusion
some
one
had
been
upon
the
ridge
a
woman
i
supposed
and
had
passed
down
under
the
cover
of
the
trees
this
was
the
natural
explanation
of
what
i
had
seen
and
of
course
contented
me
at
the
same
time
the
silent
apparition
could
not
fail
to
arouse
my
curiosity
and
instead
of
remaining
seated
and
giving
way
to
dreamy
reflections
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
stood
looking
and
listening
with
eager
expectation
who
could
the
woman
be
an
indian
of
course
it
was
not
probable
that
a
white
woman
should
be
in
such
a
place
and
at
such
an
hour
even
the
peculiar
outlines
of
the
shadow
were
not
those
that
would
have
been
cast
by
one
habited
in
a
garb
of
civilisation
beyond
a
doubt
the
woman
was
an
indian
what
was
she
doing
in
that
solitary
place
and
alone
these
questions
were
not
so
easily
answered
and
yet
there
was
nothing
so
remarkable
about
her
presence
upon
the
spot
to
the
children
of
the
forest
time
is
not
as
with
us
the
hours
of
the
night
are
as
those
of
the
day
often
the
hours
of
action
or
enjoyment
she
might
have
many
a
purpose
in
being
there
she
might
be
on
her
way
to
the
pond
for
water
to
take
a
bath
or
it
might
be
some
impassioned
maiden
who
under
the
secret
shadows
of
this
secluded
grove
was
keeping
assignation
with
her
lover
a
pang
like
a
poisoned
arrow
passed
through
my
heart
it
be
the
unpleasantness
which
this
conjecture
caused
me
is
indescribable
i
had
been
all
day
the
victim
of
dire
suspicions
arising
from
some
words
casually
dropped
from
the
lips
of
a
young
officer
and
which
i
had
chanced
to
overhear
they
had
reference
to
a
beautiful
girl
among
the
indians
apparently
at
the
fort
and
i
noticed
that
the
tone
of
the
young
fellow
was
that
of
one
either
triumphant
or
boasting
i
listened
attentively
to
every
word
and
watched
not
only
the
countenance
of
the
speaker
but
those
of
his
auditory
to
make
out
in
which
of
the
two
categories
i
should
place
him
his
vanity
appeared
to
have
had
some
sacrifice
made
to
it
at
least
by
his
own
statement
and
his
listeners
or
most
of
them
agreed
to
concede
to
him
the
happiness
of
a
there
was
no
name
given
no
hint
that
would
enable
me
to
connect
the
subject
of
the
conversation
with
that
of
my
own
thoughts
but
that
the
girl
was
an
indian
and
a
beauty
were
points
that
my
jealous
heart
almost
accepted
as
sufficient
for
identification
i
might
easily
have
become
satisfied
a
word
a
simple
question
would
have
procured
me
the
knowledge
i
longed
for
and
yet
i
dared
not
say
that
word
i
preferred
passing
long
hours
a
whole
day
upon
the
rack
of
uncertainty
and
suspicion
thus
then
was
i
prepared
for
the
painful
conjectures
that
sprang
into
my
thoughts
on
beholding
that
mirrored
form
the
pain
was
of
short
duration
almost
instantaneous
was
the
relief
a
shadowy
figure
was
seen
gliding
around
the
edge
of
the
pond
it
emerged
into
the
open
moonlight
not
six
paces
from
where
i
stood
i
had
a
full
and
distinct
view
of
it
it
was
a
woman
an
indian
woman
it
was
maumee
chapter
thirty
three
i
saw
before
me
a
woman
of
middle
age
somewhere
between
thirty
and
forty
a
large
woman
who
once
possessed
beauty
beauty
that
had
been
abused
she
was
the
wreck
of
a
grand
loveliness
whose
outlines
could
not
be
effaced
like
the
statue
of
some
grecian
goddess
broken
by
vandal
hands
but
whose
very
fragments
are
things
of
priceless
value
not
that
her
charms
had
departed
there
are
men
who
affect
to
admire
this
ripe
maturity
to
them
she
would
have
been
a
thing
of
peerless
splendour
time
had
made
no
inroad
upon
those
large
rounded
arms
none
upon
the
elliptical
outlines
of
that
noble
bust
i
could
judge
of
this
for
it
was
before
my
eyes
in
the
bright
moonlight
nude
from
neck
to
waist
as
in
the
hour
of
infancy
alone
the
black
hair
hanging
in
wild
dishevelment
over
the
shoulders
formed
a
partial
shrouding
nor
had
time
laid
a
finger
upon
this
amidst
all
that
profusion
of
rich
raven
clusters
not
a
strand
of
silver
could
be
detected
time
could
not
affect
nor
had
it
that
fine
facial
outline
the
moulding
of
the
chin
the
oval
of
those
lips
the
aquiline
nose
with
its
delicate
spirally
curved
nostril
the
high
smooth
front
the
eye
the
eye
what
is
it
why
that
unearthly
flash
that
wild
unmeaning
glance
ha
that
eye
merciful
heavens
woman
is
alas
it
was
true
she
was
mad
her
glance
would
have
satisfied
even
a
casual
observer
that
reason
was
no
longer
upon
its
throne
but
i
needed
not
to
look
at
her
eye
i
knew
the
story
of
her
misfortunes
of
her
wrongs
it
was
not
the
first
time
i
had
looked
upon
that
womanly
form
more
than
once
i
had
stood
face
to
face
with
note
the
mad
queen
of
the
micosaucs
beautiful
as
she
was
i
might
have
felt
fear
at
her
presence
still
worse
than
fear
i
might
have
been
terrified
or
awed
the
more
so
on
perceiving
that
her
necklace
was
a
green
serpent
that
the
girdle
around
her
waist
that
glittered
so
conspicuously
in
the
light
of
the
moon
was
the
body
of
an
enormous
rattlesnake
living
and
writhing
yes
both
were
alive
the
smaller
serpent
wound
about
her
neck
with
its
head
resting
upon
her
bosom
the
more
dangerous
reptile
knotted
around
her
waist
its
vertebrated
tail
hanging
by
her
side
while
its
head
held
in
her
hand
protruding
through
her
fingers
exhibited
a
pair
of
eyes
that
scintillated
like
diamonds
on
the
head
of
was
no
other
covering
than
that
which
nature
had
provided
for
it
but
those
thick
black
clusters
afforded
ample
protection
against
sun
and
storm
on
her
feet
she
wore
moccasins
but
those
were
hidden
by
the
long
hunna
that
reached
to
the
ground
this
was
the
only
garment
she
wore
it
was
profusely
adorned
with
beads
and
embroidery
with
the
bright
plumage
of
the
green
parroquet
the
skin
of
the
and
the
for
of
various
wild
animals
it
was
fastened
round
her
waist
though
not
by
the
girdle
already
described
truly
i
might
have
felt
terror
had
this
singular
appearance
been
new
to
me
but
i
had
seen
all
before
the
green
snake
and
the
crotalus
the
long
hanging
tresses
the
wild
flash
of
that
maniac
eye
all
before
all
harmless
all
innocuous
at
least
to
me
i
knew
it
and
had
no
fear
i
called
out
as
she
advanced
to
where
i
was
standing
an
expression
of
astonishment
usually
lengthened
out
into
a
sort
of
drawl
exclaimed
she
with
a
show
of
surprise
young
randolph
among
the

then
forgotten

i
list
to
his
lying
tongue
that
poisoned
my
heart
when
my
life
was
young
ho
ho
ho
down
note
she
cried
interrupting
the
strain
and
addressing
herself
to
the
rattlesnake
that
at
my
presence
had
protruded
his
head
and
was
making
demonstrations
of
rage
down
great
king
of
the
serpents
is
a
friend
though
in
the
garb
of
an
enemy
quiet
or
i
crush
your
head
she
exclaimed
again
as
if
struck
by
some
new
thought
i
waste
time
with
my
old
songs
he
is
gone
he
is
gone
they
can
not
bring
him
back
now
young
mico
what
came
i
for
what
came
i
for
as
she
uttered
these
interrogatives
she
raised
her
hand
to
her
head
as
if
to
assist
her
memory
oh
now
i
remember
it
is
bad
i
lose
time

your
people
do
not
stray
from
your
blue
soldiers
do
not
wander
in
the
woods
your
life
is
in
danger
all
this
was
spoken
in
a
tone
of
earnestness
that
astonished
me
more
than
astonished
i
began
to
feel
some
slight
alarm
since
i
had
not
forgotten
the
attempted
assassination
of
yesterday
moreover
i
knew
that
there
were
periods
when
this
singular
woman
was
not
positively
insane
she
had
her
lucid
intervals
during
which
she
both
talked
and
acted
rationally
and
often
with
extraordinary
intelligence
this
might
be
one
of
those
intervals
she
might
be
privy
to
some
scheme
against
my
life
and
had
come
as
she
alleged
to
defeat
it
but
who
was
my
enemy
or
enemies
and
how
could
she
have
known
of
their
design
in
order
to
ascertain
this
i
said
to
her
i
have
no
enemy
ewa
why
should
my
life
be
in
danger
i
tell
you
pretty
mico
it
is
you
have
enemies
you
do
not
know
it
i
never
wronged
a
red
man
in
my
life
red
did
i
say
red
man
boy
pretty
randolph
there
is
not
a
red
man
in
all
the
land
of
the
seminoles
that
would
pluck
a
hair
from
your
head
oh
if
they
did
what
would
say
the
rising
sun
he
would
consume
them
like
a
forest
fire
fear
not
the
red
men
your
enemies
are
not
of
that
colour
ha
not
red
men
what
then
some
white

yellow
nonsense
ewa
i
have
never
given
a
white
man
cause
to
be
my
enemy
fawn
you
are
but
a
young
fawn
whose
mother
has
not
told
it
of
the
savage
beasts
that
roam
the
forest
there
are
wicked
men
who
are
enemies
without
a
cause
there
are
some
who
seek
your
life
though
you
never
did
them
wrong
but
who
are
they
and
for
what
reason
do
not
ask
chepawnee
there
is
not
time
enough
if
i
tell
you
you
are
owner
of
a
rich
plantation
where
black
men
make
the
blue
dye
you
have
a
fair
sister
very
fair
is
she
not
like
a
beam
from
yonder
moon
and
i
was
fair
once
so
he
said
ah
it
is
bad
to
be
beautiful
ho
ho
ho
why
did
i
trust
in
a
lover
ho
ho
ho
why
did
i
meet
him
she
exclaimed
again
suddenly
breaking
off
the
strain
i
am
mad
but
i
remember
go
begone
i
tell
you
go
you
are
but
an
fawn
and
the
hunters
are
upon
your
trail
back
to
the
topekee
go
go
i
can
not
ewa
i
am
here
for
a
purpose
i
must
remain
till
some
one
comes
till
some
one
comes
will
come
soon
who
your
enemies
they
who
would
kill
you
and
then
the
pretty
doe
will
bleed
her
poor
heart
will
bleed
she
will
go
mad
she
will
be
like
whom
do
you
speak
of
of
hush
hush
hush
it
is
too
late
they
come
they
come
see
their
shadows
upon
the
water
i
looked
as
pointed
sure
enough
there
were
shadows
upon
the
pond
just
where
i
had
seen
hers
they
were
the
figures
of
men
four
of
them
they
were
moving
among
the
and
along
the
ridge
in
a
few
seconds
the
shadows
disappeared
they
who
had
been
causing
them
had
descended
the
slope
and
entered
among
the
timber
it
is
too
late
now
whispered
the
maniac
evidently
at
that
moment
in
full
possession
of
her
intellect
you
dare
not
go
out
into
the
open
woods
they
would
see
you
you
must
stay
in
the
thicket
there
continued
she
grasping
me
by
the
wrist
and
with
a
powerful
jerk
bringing
me
close
to
the
trunk
of
the
this
is
your
only
chance
quick
ascend
conceal
yourself
among
the
moss
be
silent
stir
not
till
i
return
it
is
good
it
is
well
and
so
saying
my
strange
counsellor
stepped
back
under
the
shadow
of
the
tree
and
gliding
into
the
umbrageous
covert
of
the
grove
disappeared
from
my
sight
i
had
followed
her
directions
and
was
now
ensconced
upon
one
of
the
great
limbs
of
the
perfectly
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
any
one
below
by
festoons
of
the
silvery
these
hanging
from
branches
still
higher
up
draped
around
me
like
a
set
of
gauze
curtains
and
completely
enveloped
my
whole
body
while
i
myself
had
a
view
of
the
pond
at
least
that
side
of
it
on
which
the
moon
was
shining
by
means
of
a
small
opening
between
the
leaves
at
first
i
fancied
i
was
playing
a
very
ridiculous
the
story
about
enemies
and
my
life
being
in
danger
might
after
all
be
nothing
more
than
some
crazy
fancy
of
the
poor
maniac
brain
the
men
whose
shadows
i
had
seen
might
be
the
chiefs
on
their
return
they
would
reach
the
ground
where
i
had
appointed
to
meet
them
and
not
finding
me
there
would
go
back
what
kind
of
report
should
i
carry
to
the
thing
was
ridiculous
enough
and
for
me
the
result
might
be
worse
than
ridiculous
under
these
reflections
i
felt
strongly
inclined
to
descend
and
meet
the
men
whoever
they
might
be
face
to
face
other
reflections
however
hindered
me
the
chiefs
were
only
there
were
shadows
true
the
chiefs
might
be
accompanied
by
some
of
their
followers
for
better
security
to
themselves
on
such
a
traitorous
mission
but
i
had
noticed
as
the
shadows
were
passing
over
the
pond
and
notwithstanding
the
rapidity
with
which
they
moved
that
the
figures
were
not
of
i
observed
no
hanging
drapery
nor
plumes
on
the
contrary
i
fancied
there
were
upon
their
heads
such
as
are
worn
only
by
white
men
it
was
the
observation
of
this
peculiarity
that
made
me
so
ready
to
yield
obedience
to
the
solicitations
of
other
circumstances
had
not
failed
to
impress
me
the
strange
assertions
made
by
the
indian
woman
her
knowledge
of
events
and
the
odd
allusions
to
persons
the
affair
of
yesterday
all
these
commingling
in
my
mind
had
the
effect
of
determining
me
to
remain
upon
my
perch
at
least
for
some
minutes
longer
i
might
be
relieved
from
my
unpleasant
position
sooner
than
i
expected
without
motion
almost
without
breathing
i
kept
my
seat
my
eyes
carefully
watching
and
ears
keenly
bent
to
catch
every
sound
my
suspense
was
brief
the
acuteness
of
my
eyes
was
rewarded
by
a
sight
and
my
ears
by
a
tale
that
caused
my
flesh
to
creep
and
the
blood
to
run
cold
in
my
veins
in
five
minutes
time
i
was
inducted
into
a
belief
in
the
wickedness
of
the
human
heart
exceeding
in
enormity
all
that
i
had
ever
read
or
heard
of
four
demons
filed
before
me
demons
beyond
a
doubt
their
looks
which
i
noted
well
their
words
which
i
heard
their
gestures
which
i
saw
their
designs
with
which
i
in
that
hour
became
acquainted
fully
entitled
them
to
the
appellation
they
were
passing
around
the
pond
i
saw
their
faces
one
after
another
as
they
emerged
into
the
moonlight
foremost
appeared
the
pale
thin
visage
of
arens
ringgold
next
the
sinister
aquiline
features
of
spence
and
after
him
the
broad
brutal
face
of
the
bully
williams
there
were
who
was
the
fourth
am
i
dreaming
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
is
it
real
is
it
an
illusion
are
my
senses
gone
astray
or
is
it
only
a
resemblance
a
counterpart
no
no
no
it
is
no
counterpart
but
the
man
himself
that
black
curling
hair
that
tawny
skin
the
form
the
gait
all
all
are
his
god
it
is
yellow
note
literally
crazy
wife
from
crazy
and
or

have
remarked
the
resemblance
of
this
muscogee
word
to
the
hebraic
name
of

mother

of

most
remarkable
serpent

a

dread
of
this
reptile
chapter
thirty
four
a
pretty
plot
to
dispute
the
identity
was
to
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
senses
the
mulatto
was
before
me
just
as
i
remembered
him
though
with
changed
apparel
and
perhaps
grown
a
little
bigger
in
body
but
the
features
were
the
same
that
the
same
as
that
presented
by
yellow
jake
the
woodman
of
our
plantation
and
yet
how
could
it
be
he
and
in
the
company
of
arens
ringgold
too
one
of
the
most
active
of
his
intended
executioners
no
no
no
altogether
improbable
utterly
impossible
then
must
i
be
deluded
my
eyes
deceiving
me
for
as
certain
as
i
looked
upon
man
i
was
looking
upon
jake
the
mulatto
he
was
not
twenty
feet
from
where
i
lay
hidden
his
face
was
full
towards
me
the
moon
was
shining
upon
it
with
a
brilliancy
scarcely
inferior
to
the
light
of
day
i
could
note
the
old
expression
of
evil
in
his
eyes
and
mark
the
play
of
his
features
it
yellow
jake
to
confirm
the
impression
i
remembered
that
notwithstanding
all
remonstrance
and
ridicule
the
black
pertinaciously
adhered
to
his
story
he
would
listen
to
no
compromise
no
hypothesis
founded
upon
resemblance
he
had
seen
yellow
jake
or
his
ghost
this
was
his
firm
belief
and
i
had
been
unable
to
shake
it
another
circumstance
i
now
remember
the
strange
behaviour
of
the
ringgolds
during
the
postprandial
conversation
the
action
of
arens
when
i
mentioned
the
mulatto
name
it
had
attracted
my
attention
at
the
time
but
what
was
i
to
think
now
here
was
a
man
supposed
to
be
dead
in
company
of
three
others
who
had
been
active
in
assisting
at
his
death
one
of
them
the
very
keenest
of
his
executioners
and
all
four
now
apparently
as
thick
as
thieves
how
was
i
to
explain
in
one
moment
this
wonderful
resurrection
and
reconciliation
i
could
not
explain
it
it
was
too
complicated
a
mystery
to
be
unravelled
by
a
moment
reflection
and
i
should
have
failed
had
not
the
parties
themselves
soon
after
aided
me
to
an
elucidation
i
had
arrived
at
the
only
natural
conclusion
and
this
was
that
the
mulatto
notwithstanding
the
perfect
resemblance
not
yellow
jake
this
of
course
would
account
for
everything
after
a
manner
and
had
the
four
men
gone
away
without
parley
i
should
have
contented
myself
with
this
hypothesis
but
they
went
not
until
after
affording
me
an
opportunity
of
overhearing
a
conversation
which
gave
me
to
know
that
not
only
was
yellow
jake
in
the
land
of
the
but
that
had
spoken
the
truth
when
she
told
me
life
was
in
damn
he
not
here
and
yet
where
can
he
have
gone
the
ejaculation
and
interrogative
were
in
the
voice
of
arens
ringgold
uttered
in
a
tone
of
peevish
surprise
some
one
was
sought
for
by
the
party
who
could
not
be
found
who
that
was
the
next
speaker
made
manifest
there
was
a
pause
and
then
reached
my
ears
the
voice
of
bill
williams
which
i
easily
recognised
from
having
heard
it
but
the
day
before
you
are
sartint
master
arens
he
did
sneak
back
to
the
fort
wi
the
ginral
sure
of
it
replied
master
arens
i
was
by
the
gate
as
they
came
in
there
were
only
the
two
the
general
and
the
commissioner
but
the
question
is
did
he
leave
the
hommock
along
with
them
there
where
we
played
devil
fool
with
the
business
in
not
getting
here
in
time
and
watching
them
as
they
left
but
who
have
thought
he
was
going
to
stay
behind
them
if
i
had
only
known
that
you
say
he
continued
turning
to
the
mulatto
you
say
you
came
direct
from
the
indian
camp
he
could
have
passed
you
on
the
path
aren
no
the
voice
the
old
spanish
expression
of
profanity
just
as
i
had
heard
them
in
my
youth
if
there
had
been
doubt
of
the
identity
it
was
gone
the
testimony
of
my
ears
confirmed
that
of
my
eyes
the
speaker
was
yellow
jake
straight
from
seminole
come
cat
no
pass
me
on
the
road
i
see
her
two
chiefs
me
meet
i
hide
under
the
palmettoes
they
no
me
see
no
deuce
take
it
where
can
he
have
gone
there
no
signs
of
him
here
i
know
he
have
a
for
paying
a
visit
to
the
indians
that
i
know
but
how
has
he
got
round
there
without
jake
seeing
him
what
to
hinder
him
to
hev
goed
round
the
tother
road
by
the
open
plain
yes
that
away
no
he
would
not
be
likely
there
only
one
way
i
can
explain
it
he
must
have
come
as
far
as
the
gate
along
with
the
general
and
then
kept
down
the
stockade
and
past
the
sutler
house
that
likely
enough
this
was
said
by
ringgold
in
a
sort
of
half
soliloquy
devils
he
exclaimed
in
an
impatient
tone
we
not
get
such
a
chance
soon
again
a
fear
master
arens
said
williams
a
fear
plenty
chances
i
kalkerlate
gobs
o
chances
sech
times
as
these
we

he

returned
inside
the
fort
remarked
ringgold
again
speaking
in
a
half
soliloquy
i
think
he
has
not
if
no
then
he
should
be
at
the
camp
he
must
go
back
it
may
be
after
the

open
ground
in

darkness

know
how
to
profit
by
the
hint
eh
si
senor
jake
know
well
then
we
must
return
hear
me
jake
if
here
the
voice
of
the
speaker
fell
into
a
half
whisper
and
i
could
not
hear
what
was
said
occasionally
there
were
phrases
muttered
so
loudly
that
i
could
catch
their
sound
and
from
what
had
already
transpired
was
enabled
to
apprehend
something
of
their
signification
i
heard
frequently
pronounced
the
names
of
viola
the
quadroon
and
that
of
my
own
sister
the
phrases
only
one
that
stands
in
our
way
mother
easily
consent
when
i
am
master
of
the
plantation
pay
you
two
hundred
dollars
these
with
others
of
like
import
satisfied
me
that
between
the
two
fiends
some
contract
for
the
taking
of
my
life
had
already
been
formed
and
that
this
muttered
dialogue
was
only
a
repetition
of
the
terms
of
the
hideous
bargain
no
wonder
that
the
cold
sweat
was
oozing
from
my
temples
and
standing
in
drops
upon
my
brow
no
wonder
that
i
sat
upon
my
perch
shaking
like
an
aspen
far
less
with
fear
than
with
horror
at
the
contemplated
crime
absolute
horror
i
might
have
trembled
in
a
greater
degree
but
that
my
nerves
were
to
some
extent
stayed
by
the
terrible
indignation
that
was
swelling
up
within
my
bosom
i
had
sufficient
command
of
my
temper
to
remain
silent
it
was
prudent
i
did
so
had
i
discovered
myself
at
that
moment
i
should
never
have
left
the
ground
alive
i
felt
certain
of
this
and
took
care
to
make
no
noise
that
might
betray
my
presence
and
yet
it
was
hard
to
hear
four
men
coolly
conspiring
against
life
plotting
and
bargaining
it
away
like
a
piece
of
merchandise
each
expecting
some
profit
from
the
speculation
my
wrath
was
as
powerful
as
my
fears
almost
too
strong
for
prudence
there
were
four
of
them
all
armed
i
had
sword
and
pistols
but
this
would
not
have
made
me
a
match
for
four
desperadoes
such
as
they
had
there
been
only
two
of
them
only
ringgold
and
the
mulatto
so
desperate
was
my
indignation
at
that
moment
i
should
have
leaped
from
the
tree
and
risked
the
encounter
qui
but
i
disobeyed
the
promptings
of
passion
and
remained
silent
till
they
had
moved
away
i
observed
that
ringgold
and
his
brace
of
bullies
went
towards
the
fort
while
the
mulatto
took
the
direction
of
the
indian
camp
chapter
thirty
five
light
after
darkness
i
stirred
not
till
they
were
gone
till
long
after
in
fact
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
that
for
some
moments
hindered
me
either
from
acting
or
thinking
and
i
sat
as
if
glued
to
the
branch
reflection
came
at
length
and
i
began
to
speculate
upon
what
i
had
just
heard
and
seen
was
it
a
farce
to
frighten
me
no
no
they
were
not
the
characters
of
a
farce
not
one
of
the
four
and
the
of
yellow
jake
partaking
as
it
did
of
the
wild
and
supernatural
was
too
dramatic
too
serious
to
form
an
episode
in
comedy
on
the
contrary
i
had
just
listened
to
the
prologue
of
an
intended
tragedy
of
which
i
was
myself
to
be
the
victim
beyond
doubt
these
men
had
a
design
upon
my
life
four
men
too
not
one
of
whom
could
charge
me
with
ever
having
done
him
a
serious
injury
i
knew
that
all
four
disliked
me
and
ever
had
though
spence
and
williams
could
have
no
other
cause
of
offence
than
what
might
spring
from
boyish
grudge
by
me
but
doubtless
their
motive
was
ringgold
as
for
the
mulatto
i
could
understand
his
hostility
though
mistaken
it
was
of
the
deadliest
kind
but
what
was
i
to
think
of
arens
ringgold
the
leader
in
this
designed
assassination
a
man
of
some
education
my
equal
in
social
rank
a
gentleman
o
arens
ringgold
arens
ringgold
how
was
i
to
explain
it
how
account
for
conduct
so
atrocious
so
fiendish
i
knew
that
this
young
man
liked
me
but
little
of
late
less
than
ever
i
knew
the
cause
too
i
stood
in
the
way
of
his
relations
with
my
sister
at
least
so
thought
he
and
he
had
reason
for
since
my
father
death
i
had
spoken
more
freely
of
family
affairs
i
had
openly
declared
that
with
my
consent
he
should
never
be
my
brother
and
this
declaration
had
reached
him
i
could
easily
believe
therefore
that
he
was
angry
with
me
but
anger
that
would
impel
a
man
to
such
demoniac
purpose
i
could
not
comprehend
and
what
meant
those
phrases
one
that
stands
in
our
way
mother
easily
consent
master
of
the
plantation
coupled
with
the
names
of
viola
and
my
sister
what
meant
they
i
could
give
them
but
one
and
that
a
terrible
interpretation
too
fearful
to
dwell
upon
i
could
scarcely
credit
my
senses
scarcely
believe
that
i
was
not
labouring
under
some
horrid
hallucination
some
confusion
of
the
brain
produced
by
my
having
been
with
the
maniac
but
no
the
moon
had
been
over
them
my
eyes
open
upon
them
my
ears
open
and
could
not
have
deceived
me
i
saw
what
they
did
i
heard
what
they
said
they
designed
to
kill
me

with

off

wild
song
tell

ewa
of
whom
are
you
speaking
is
it
the
name
trembled
upon
my
tongue
i
hesitated
to
pronounce
it
notwithstanding
that
my
heart
was
full
of
delightful
hope
from
the
confidence
i
felt
of
receiving
an
affirmative
answer
i
dreaded
to
put
the
question
not
a
great
while
did
i
hesitate
i
had
gone
too
far
to
recede
i
had
long
waited
to
satisfy
the
wish
of
a
yearning
heart
i
could
wait
no
longer
ewa
might
give
me
the
satisfaction
i
pronounced
the
words
is
it
maumee
the
maniac
gazed
upon
me
for
some
moments
without
speaking
the
expression
of
her
eye
i
could
not
read
for
the
last
few
minutes
it
had
been
one
of
reproach
and
scorn
as
i
uttered
the
name
it
changed
to
a
look
of
bewilderment
and
then
her
glance
became
fixed
upon
me
as
if
searching
my
thoughts
if
it
be
maumee
i
continued
without
awaiting
her
reply
for
i
was
now
carried
away
by
the
ardour
of
my
resuscitated
passion
if
it
be
she
know
ewa
that
her
i
love
maumee
i
love
you
love
maumee
you
still
love
maumee
interrogated
the
maniac
with
startling
quickness
ay
ewa
by
my
life
by
my
swear
not
very
oath
and
he
was
false
speak
again
young
mico
say
you
love
maumee
say
you
are
true
but
do
not
swear
true
true
hinklas
cried
the
woman
in
a
loud
and
apparently
joyful
tone
the
mico
is
true
the
pretty
mico
is
true
and
the
the
pretty
one
will
be
happy
ho
ho
now
for
the
love
the
sweet
young
love
under
the
tala
tree

who
would
not
be
like
yonder
dove
the
wild
little
dove
the
soft
little
dove
sitting
close
by
his
mate
in
the
shade
of
the
grove
to
his
mate
in
the
shade
of
the
grove
with
none
to
hear
or
see
down
she
exclaimed
once
more
addressing
the
rattlesnake
and
you
green
snake

her
voice
and
speaking
with
increased
earnestness

my
king
of
serpents
you
will
ho
ho
ho
as
she
spoke
the
reptile
appeared
to
comprehend
her
for
its
head
was
suddenly
raised
aloft
its
bright
basilisk
eyes
gleamed
as
though
emitting
sparks
of
fire
its
forked
glittering
tongue
was
protruded
from
its
mouth
and
the
of
the
rattles
could
be
heard
for
some
moments
sounding
continuously
quiet
now
quiet
said
she
with
a
motion
of
her
fingers
causing
the
serpent
to
resume
its
attitude
of
repose
not
he
not
he
thou
king
of

look
yonder
to
the
west
the
night
sun
the
moon
is
going
to
bed
you
must
be
gone
you
dare
not
walk
in
the
darkness
you
must
get
back
to
the
before
the
moon
is
hid
go
go
go
but
i
told
you
ewa
i
had
business
here
i
dare
not
leave
till
it
is
done
there
is
danger
then
what
business
mico
ah
i
guess
see
they
come
for
whom
you
wait
true
it
is
they
i
believe
i
said
this
as
i
perceived
the
tall
shadows
of
the
two
chiefs
flitting
along
the
further
edge
of
the
pond
be
quick
then
do
what
you
must
but
waste
not
time
in
the
darkness
you
will
meet
danger
must
be
gone
good
night
young
mico
good
night
i
returned
the
salutation
and
facing
round
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
chiefs
lost
sight
of
my
strange
companion
the
indians
soon
came
upon
the
ground
and
briefly
delivered
their
report
holata
mico
had
struck
his
tents
and
was
moving
away
from
the
encampment
i
was
too
much
disgusted
with
these
traitorous
men
to
spend
a
moment
in
their
company
and
as
soon
as
i
had
gained
the
required
information
i
hurried
away
from
their
presence
warned
by
as
well
as
by
the
words
of
arens
ringgold
i
lost
no
time
in
returning
to
the
fort
the
moon
was
still
above
the
horizon
and
i
had
the
advantage
of
her
light
to
protect
me
from
being
surprised
by
any
sudden
onset
i
walked
hastily
taking
the
precaution
to
keep
in
the
open
ground
and
giving
a
wide
berth
to
any
covert
that
might
shelter
an
assassin
i
saw
no
one
on
the
way
nor
around
the
back
of
the
stockade
on
arriving
opposite
the
gate
of
the
fort
however
i
perceived
the
figure
of
a
man
not
far
from
the
sutler
store
apparently
skulking
behind
some
logs
i
fancied
i
knew
the
man
i
fancied
he
was
the
mulatto
i
would
have
gone
after
him
and
satisfied
myself
but
i
had
already
hailed
the
sentinel
and
given
the
countersign
and
i
did
not
desire
to
cause
a
flurry
among
the
guard
particularly
as
i
had
received
injunctions
to
pass
in
as
privately
as
possible
another
time
i
should
likely
encounter
this
jacob
when
i
should
be
less
embarrassed
and
perhaps
have
a
better
opportunity
of
calling
him
and
his
diabolical
associates
to
an
account
with
this
reflection
i
passed
through
the
gate
and
carried
my
report
to
the
quarters
of
the
chapter
thirty
six
in
need
of
a
friend
to
pass
the
night
under
the
same
roof
with
a
man
who
intends
to
murder
you
is
anything
but
pleasant
and
repose
under
the
circumstance
is
next
to
impossible
i
slept
but
little
and
the
little
sleep
i
did
obtain
was
not
tranquil
before
retiring
for
the
night
i
had
seen
nothing
of
the
ringgolds
neither
father
nor
son
but
i
knew
they
were
still
in
the
fort
where
they
were
to
remain
as
guests
a
day
or
two
longer
they
had
either
gone
to
bed
before
my
return
or
were
entertained
in
the
quarters
of
some
friendly
officer
at
all
events
they
did
not
appear
to
me
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
neither
saw
i
aught
of
spence
and
williams
these
worthies
if
in
the
fort
would
find
a
lodgment
among
the
soldiers
but
i
did
not
seek
them
most
of
the
night
i
lay
awake
pondering
on
the
strange
incidents
of
the
day
or
rather
upon
that
one
episode
that
had
made
me
acquainted
with
such
deadly
enemies
i
was
in
a
state
of
sad
perplexity
as
to
what
course
i
should
pursue
uncertain
all
night
long
and
when
daylight
shone
through
the
shutters
still
uncertain
my
first
impulse
had
been
to
disclose
the
whole
affair
at
and
demand
an
investigation
a
punishment
on
reflection
this
course
would
not
do
what
proofs
could
i
offer
of
so
grave
an
accusation
only
my
own
assertions
unbacked
by
any
other
evidence
unsustained
even
by
probability
for
who
would
have
given
credence
to
crime
so
unparalleled
in
atrocity
though
certain
the
assassins
referred
to
me
i
could
not
assert
that
they
had
even
mentioned
my
name
my
story
would
be
treated
with
ridicule
myself
perhaps
with
something
worse
the
ringgolds
were
mighty
men
personal
friends
both
of
the
general
and
commissioner
and
though
known
to
be
a
little
scoundrelly
and
unscrupulous
in
worldly
affairs
still
holding
the
rank
of
gentlemen
it
would
need
better
evidence
than
i
could
offer
to
prove
arens
ringgold
a
murderer
i
saw
the
difficulty
and
kept
my
secret
another
plan
appeared
more
feasible
to
accuse
arens
ringgold
openly
before
all
and
challenge
him
to
mortal
combat
this
at
least
would
prove
that
i
was
sincere
in
my
allegations
but
duelling
was
against
the
laws
of
the
service
it
would
require
some
management
to
keep
clear
of
an
arrest
which
of
course
would
frustrate
the
scheme
before
satisfaction
could
be
obtained
i
had
my
own
thoughts
about
master
arens
ringgold
i
knew
his
courage
was
but
slippery
he
would
be
likely
enough
to
play
the
poltroon
but
whether
so
or
not
the
charge
and
challenge
would
go
some
way
towards
exposing
him
i
had
almost
decided
on
adopting
this
course
though
it
was
morning
before
i
had
come
to
any
determination
i
stood
sadly
in
need
of
a
friend
not
merely
a
second
for
this
i
could
easily
procure
but
a
companion
in
whom
i
could
confide
and
who
might
aid
me
by
his
counsel
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
every
officer
in
the
fort
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
with
the
ringgolds
alone
had
i
any
previous
acquaintance
in
my
dilemma
i
thought
of
one
whose
advice
might
stand
me
in
good
stead
and
i
determined
to
seek
it
black
jake
was
the
man
he
should
be
my
counsellor
shortly
after
daylight
the
brave
fellow
was
by
my
side
i
told
him
all
he
appeared
very
little
surprised
some
suspicion
of
such
a
plot
had
already
taken
possession
of
his
mind
and
it
was
his
intention
to
have
revealed
it
to
me
that
very
morning
least
of
all
did
he
express
surprise
about
yellow
jake
that
was
but
the
confirmation
of
a
belief
which
he
entertained
already
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
knew
positively
that
the
mulatto
was
living
still
more
he
had
ascertained
the
mode
by
which
the
latter
had
made
his
almost
miraculous
escape
and
yet
it
was
simple
enough
the
alligator
had
seized
him
as
was
supposed
but
the
fellow
had
the
adroitness
to
job
its
eyes
with
the
knife
and
thus
cause
it
to
let
go
its
hold
he
had
followed
the
example
of
the
young
indian
using
the
same
weapon
this
occurred
under
water
for
the
mulatto
was
a
good
diver
his
limbs
were
lacerated
hence
the
blood
but
the
wounds
did
not
signify
nor
did
they
hinder
him
from
making
further
efforts
to
escape
he
took
care
not
to
rise
to
the
surface
until
after
swimming
under
the
bank
there
concealed
by
the
drooping
branches
he
had
glided
out
and
climbed
up
into
a
where
the
moss
sheltered
him
from
the
eyes
of
his
vengeful
pursuers
being
entirely
naked
there
was
no
sign
left
by
dripping
garments
to
betray
him
besides
the
blood
upon
the
water
had
proved
his
friend
on
seeing
that
the
hunters
were
under
the
full
belief
that
he
had
gone
under
and
therefore
took
but
little
pains
to
search
further
such
was
black
jake
account
of
this
affair
he
had
obtained
it
the
evening
before
from
one
of
the
friendly
indians
at
the
fort
who
professed
to
have
the
narration
from
the
mulatto
own
lips
there
was
nothing
improbable
in
the
story
but
the
contrary
in
all
likelihood
it
was
strictly
true
and
it
at
once
dispersed
the
mysteries
that
had
gathered
in
my
mind
the
black
had
received
other
information
the
runaway
had
taken
refuge
with
one
of
the
tribes
established
amid
the
swamps
that
envelop
the
of
the
amazura
he
had
found
favour
among
his
new
associates
had
risen
to
be
a
chief
and
now
passed
under
the
cognomen
of
the
there
was
still
a
little
mystery
how
came
he
and
arens
ringgold
in
cahoot
after
all
there
was
not
much
puzzle
in
the
matter
the
planter
had
no
particular
cause
for
hating
the
runaway
his
activity
during
the
scene
of
the
baffled
execution
was
all
a
sham
the
mulatto
had
more
reason
for
resentment
but
the
loves
or
hates
of
such
men
are
easily
set
aside
where
interferes
and
can
at
any
time
be
commuted
for
gold
no
doubt
the
white
villain
had
found
the
yellow
one
of
service
in
some
base
undertaking
and
at
all
events
it
was
evident
that
the
hatchet
had
been
buried
between
them
and
their
present
relations
were
upon
the
most
friendly
footing

the
earnest
appeal
was
interrupted
by
the
braying
of
bugles
and
the
rolling
of
drums
announcing
the
assembling
of
the
council
and
without
waiting
to
reply
to
the
disinterested
remonstrance
of
my
companion
i
hastened
to
the
scene
of
my
duties
chapter
thirty
seven
the
final
assembly
the
spectacle
of
yesterday
was
repeated
the
troops
in
serried
lines
of
blue
and
steel
the
officers
in
full
uniform
with
shining
epaulettes
in
the
centre
the
staff
grouped
around
the
general
close
buttoned
and
of
brilliant
sheen
fronting
these
the
of
chiefs
backed
by
concentric
lines
of
warriors
plumed
painted
and
picturesque
horses
standing
near
some
neighing
under
ready
saddles
some
picketed
and
quietly
browsing
indian
women
in
their
long
hurrying
to
and
fro
boys
and
babes
at
play
upon
the
grass
flags
waring
above
the
soldiers
banners
and
pennons
floating
over
the
heads
of
the
red
warriors
drums
beating
bugles
braying
such
was
the
array
again
the
spectacle
was
imposing
yet
scarcely
so
much
as
that
of
the
preceding
day
the
eye
at
once
detected
a
deficiency
in
the
circle
of
the
chiefs
and
nearly
half
of
the
warriors
were
wanting
the
assemblage
no
longer
impressed
you
with
the
idea
of
a
multitude
it
was
only
a
respectable
crowd
with
room
enough
for
all
to
gather
close
around
the
council
the
absence
of
many
chiefs
was
at
once
perceived
king
onopa
was
not
there
the
coronet
of
british
brass
lacquered
symbol
of
royalty
yesterday
conspicuous
in
the
centre
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
holato
mico
was
missing
with
other
leaders
of
less
note
and
the
thinness
in
the
ranks
of
the
common
warriors
showed
that
these
chiefs
had
taken
their
followers
along
with
them
most
of
the
indians
on
the
ground
appeared
to
be
of
the
clans
of
omatla
black
dirt
and
ohala
notwithstanding
the
fewness
of
their
following
i
saw
that
arpiucki
negro
abram
and
the
dwarf
were
present
surely
these
stayed
not
to
sign
i
looked
for
osceola
it
was
not
difficult
to
discover
one
so
conspicuous
both
in
figure
and
feature
he
formed
the
last
link
in
the
now
contracted
curve
of
the
chiefs
he
was
lowest
in
rank
but
this
did
not
signify
as
regarded
his
position
perhaps
he
had
placed
himself
there
from
a
feeling
of
modesty
a
characteristic
of
the
man
he
was
in
truth
the
very
youngest
of
the
chiefs
and
by
birthright
entitled
to
a
smaller
command
than
any
present
but
viewing
him
as
he
stood
even
at
the
bottom
of
the
rank
one
could
not
help
fancying
that
he
was
the
head
of
all
as
upon
the
preceding
day
there
was
no
appearance
of
bravado
about
him
his
attitude
though
stately
and
statuesque
was
one
of
perfect
ease
his
arms
were
folded
over
his
full
chest
his
weight
resting
on
one
limb
the
other
slightly
retired
his
features
in
repose
or
now
and
then
lit
up
by
an
expression
rather
of
gentleness
he
seemed
the
impersonation
of
an
apollo
or
to
speak
less
mythologically
a
gentleman
waiting
for
some
ceremony
of
which
he
was
to
be
a
simple
spectator
as
yet
nothing
had
transpired
to
excite
him
no
words
had
been
uttered
to
rouse
a
spirit
that
only
to
slumber
ere
long
that
attitude
of
repose
would
pass
away
that
soft
smile
would
change
to
the
harsh
frown
of
passion
gazing
upon
his
face
one
could
hardly
fancy
such
a
transformation
possible
and
yet
a
close
observer
might
it
was
like
the
placid
sky
that
precedes
the
storm
the
calm
ocean
that
in
a
moment
may
be
convulsed
by
the
squall
the
couchant
lion
that
on
the
slightest
provocation
may
be
roused
to
ungovernable
rage
during
the
moments
that
preceded
the
inauguration
of
the
council
i
kept
my
eyes
upon
the
young
chief
other
eyes
were
regarding
him
as
well
he
was
the
cynosure
of
many
but
mine
was
a
gaze
of
peculiar
interest
i
looked
for
some
token
of
recognition
but
received
none
neither
nod
nor
glance
once
or
twice
his
eye
fell
upon
me
but
passed
on
to
some
one
else
as
though
i
was
but
one
among
the
crowd
of
his
adversaries
he
appeared
not
to
remember
me
was
this
really
so
or
was
it
that
his
mind
preoccupied
with
great
thoughts
hindered
him
from
taking
notice
i
did
not
fail
to
cast
my
eyes
abroad
over
the
plain
to
the
tents
towards
the
groups
of
loitering
women
i
scanned
their
forms
one
after
another
i
fancied
i
saw
the
mad
queen
in
their
midst
a
centre
of
interest
i
had
hopes
that
her
might
be
near
but
no
none
of
the
figures
satisfied
my
eye
they
were
all
too
too
short
or
too
tall
too
corpulent
or
too
she
was
not
there
even
under
the
loose
i
should
have
recognised
her
splendid
form
still
if
the
hypothesis
excites
your
surprise
why
changed
you
ask
growth
development
maturity
rapid
in
this
southern
clime
is
the
passage
from
maiden
form
to
that
of
matron
no
not
that
not
that
though
still
so
young
the
undulating
outlines
had
already
shown
themselves
when
i
last
looked
upon
her
her
stature
had
reached
its
limits
her
form
exhibited
the
bold
curve
of
hogarth
so
characteristic
of
womanhood
complete
not
that
did
i
fear
and
what
then
the
contrary
change
from
attenuation
from
illness
or
grief
nor
this
i
can
not
explain
the
suspicions
that
racked
me
sprung
from
a
stray
speech
that
jay
bird
that
yestreen
chattered
so
gaily
had
poured
poison
into
my
heart
but
no
it
could
not
be
maumee
she
was
too
innocent
ah
why
do
i
rave
there
is
no
guilt
in
love
if
true
if
she
hers
was
not
crime
he
alone
was
the
guilty
one
i
have
ill
described
the
torture
i
experienced
consequent
upon
my
unlucky
during
the
whole
of
the
preceding
days
it
had
been
a
source
of
real
suffering
i
was
in
the
predicament
of
one
who
had
heard
too
much
and
to
little
you
will
scarcely
wonder
that
the
words
of
cheered
me
they
drove
the
unworthy
suspicion
out
of
my
mind
and
inspired
me
with
fresh
hopes
true
she
had
mentioned
no
name
till
i
myself
had
pronounced
it
but
to
whom
could
her
speech
refer
poor
bird
of
the
forest
her
heart
will
bleed
and
break
she
spoke
of
the
rising
sun
that
was
osceola
who
could
the
haintclitz
be
who
but
maumee
it
might
be
but
a
tale
of
bygone
days
a
glimpse
of
the
past
deeply
impressed
upon
the
brain
of
the
maniac
and
still
living
in
her
memory
this
was
possible
had
known
us
in
these
days
had
often
met
us
in
our
wild
wood
rambles
had
even
been
with
us
upon
the
island
for
the
mad
queen
could
paddle
her
canoe
with
skill
could
ride
her
wild
steed
could
go
anywhere
went
everywhere
it
might
only
be
a
souvenir
of
these
happy
days
that
caused
her
to
speak
as
she
had
done
in
the
chaos
of
her
intellect
mistaking
the
past
for
the
present
heaven
forbid
the
thought
troubled
me
but
not
long
for
i
did
not
long
entertain
it
i
clung
to
the
pleasanter
belief
her
words
were
sweet
as
honey
and
formed
a
pleasing
counterpoise
to
the
fear
i
might
otherwise
have
felt
on
discovering
the
plot
against
my
life
with
the
knowledge
that
maumee
once
loved
still
loved
me
i
could
brave
dangers
a
greater
than
that
it
is
but
a
weak
heart
that
would
not
be
gallant
under
the
influence
of
love
encouraged
by
the
smiles
of
a
beautiful
mistress
even
cowards
can
be
brave
arens
ringgold
was
standing
by
my
side
entrained
in
the
crowd
our
garments
touched
we
conversed
together
he
was
even
more
polite
to
me
than
was
his
wont
more
his
speech
scarcely
betrayed
the
habitual
cynicism
of
his
nature
though
whenever
i
looked
him
in
the
face
his
eye
quailed
and
his
glance
sought
the
ground
for
all
that
he
had
no
suspicion
not
the
slightest
that
i
knew
i
was
side
by
side
with
the
man
who
designed
to
murder
me
chapter
thirty
eight
cashiering
the
chiefs
the
commissioner
showed
a
bolder
front
a
bold
part
had
he
resolved
to
play
but
he
felt
sure
of
success
and
consequently
there
was
an
air
of
triumph
in
his
looks
he
regarded
the
chiefs
with
the
imperious
glance
of
one
determined
to
command
them
confident
they
would
yield
obedience
to
his
wishes
at
intervals
his
eye
rested
upon
osceola
with
a
look
of
peculiar
significance
at
once
sinister
and
triumphant
i
was
in
the
secret
of
that
glance
i
guessed
its
import
i
knew
that
it
boded
no
good
to
the
young
seminole
chief
could
i
have
approached
him
at
that
moment
i
should
have
held
duty
but
lightly
and
whimpered
in
his
ear
a
word
of
warning
i
was
angry
with
myself
that
i
had
not
thought
of
this
before
could
have
borne
a
message
on
the
previous
night
why
did
i
not
send
it
my
mind
had
been
too
full
occupied
with
my
own
thoughts
i
had
not
thought
of
the
danger
that
threatened
my
friend
for
in
this
light
i
still
regarded
powell
i
had
no
exact
knowledge
of
what
was
meant
though
from
the
conversation
i
had
overheard
i
more
than
half
divined
the
commissioner
purpose
upon
some
plea
was
to
be
a
plea
was
needed
the
outrage
could
not
be
perpetrated
without
one
even
the
reckless
agent
might
not
venture
upon
such
a
stretch
of
power
without
plausible
pretext
and
how
was
this
pretext
to
be
obtained
the
withdrawal
of
onopa
and
the
hostiles
while
omatla
with
the
friendlies
remained
had
given
the
agent
the
opportunity
himself
was
to
furnish
the
would
that
i
could
have
whispered
in
his
ear
one
word
of
caution
it
was
too
late
the
toils
had
been
laid
the
trap
set
and
the
noble
game
was
about
to
enter
it
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
warn
him
i
must
stand
idly
by
spectator
to
an
act
of
injustice
a
gross
violation
of
right
a
table
was
placed
in
front
of
the
ground
occupied
by
the
general
and
staff
the
commissioner
stood
immediately
behind
it
upon
this
table
was
an
inkstand
with
pens
while
a
broad
parchment
exhibiting
the
creases
of
many
folds
was
spread
out
till
it
occupied
nearly
the
whole
surface
this
parchment
was
the
treaty
of
the
oclawaha
yesterday
began
the
commissioner
without
further
preamble
we
did
nothing
but
talk
we
are
met
to
act
this
said
he
pointing
to
the
parchment
is
the
treaty
of
payne
landing
i
hope
you
have
all
considered
what
i
said
yesterday
and
are
ready
to
sign
it
we
have
considered
replied
omatla
for
himself
and
those
of
his
party
we
are
ready
to
sign
onopa
is
head
chief
suggested
the
commissioner
let
him
sign
first
where
is
miconopa
he
added
looking
around
the
circle
with
feigned
surprise
the
is
not
here
and
why
not
here
he
should
have
been
here
why
is
he
absent
he
is
sick
he
is
not
able
to
attend
the
council
that
is

you

he
is
the
dark
brow
of
grew
darker
at
the
insult
while
his
body
quivered
with
rage
a
grunt
of
disdain
was
all
the
reply
he
made
and
folding
his
arms
he
drew
back
into
his
former
attitude
abram

his
intentions

absented

replied
the
black
in
broken
english
and
speaking
without
much
show
of
respect
for
his
interrogator

responded
the
interpreter
in
a
firm
voice
as
if
forced
to
the
answer
that
much
ob
his
mind
abe
know
he
no
to

that
ar
dockament
he

no
enough
cried
the
commissioner
in
a
loud
voice
enough
now
hear
me
chiefs
and
warriors
of
the
seminole
nation
i
appear
before
you
armed
with
a
power
from
your
great
father
the
president
he
who
is
chief
of
us
all
that
power
enables
me
to
punish
for
disloyalty
and
disobedience
and
i
now
exercise
that
right
upon
miconopa
is
no
longer
king
of
the
this
unexpected
announcement
produced
an
effect
upon
the
audience
similar
to
that
of
an
electric
shock
it
started
the
chiefs
and
warriors
into
new
attitudes
and
all
stood
looking
eagerly
at
the
speaker
but
the
expression
upon
their
faces
was
not
of
like
import
it
varied
much
some
showed
signs
of
anger
as
well
as
surprise
a
few
appeared
pleased
while
the
majority
evidently
received
the
announcement
with
incredulity
surely
the
commissioner
was
jesting
how
could
make
or
unmake
a
king
of
the
seminoles
how
could
the
great
father
himself
do
this
the
seminoles
were
a
free
nation
they
were
not
even
tributary
to
the
whites
under
no
political
connection
whatever
they
themselves
could
alone
elect
their
king
they
only
could
depose
him
surely
the
commissioner
was
jesting
not
at
all
in
another
moment
they
perceived
he
was
in
earnest
foolish
as
was
the
project
of
deposing
king
onopa
he
entertained
it
seriously
he
had
resolved
to
carry
it
into
execution
and
as
far
as
decrees
went
he
did
so
without
further
delay
omatla
you
have
been
faithful
to
your
word
and
your
honour
you
are
worthy
to
head
a
brave
nation
from
this
time
forth
are
king
of
the
seminoles
our
great
father
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
hail
you
as
such
they
will
acknowledge
no
other
now
let
the
signing
proceed
at
a
gesture
from
the
commissioner
omatla
stepped
forward
to
the
table
and
taking
the
pen
in
his
hand
wrote
his
name
upon
the
parchment
the
act
was
done
in
perfect
silence
but
one
voice
broke
the
deep
stillness
one
word
only
was
heard
uttered
with
angry
aspirate
it
was
the
word
traitor
i
looked
round
to
discover
who
had
pronounced
it
the
hiss
was
still
quivering
upon
the
lips
of
osceola
while
his
eye
was
fixed
on
omatla
with
a
glance
of
ineffable
scorn
black
crazy
clay
next
took
the
pen
and
affixed
his
signature
which
was
done
by
simply
making
his
mark
after
him
follower
ohala
itolasse
omatla
and
about
a
dozen
all
of
whom
were
known
as
the
chiefs
that
favoured
the
scheme
of
removal
the
hostile
chiefs
whether
by
accident
or
design
i
know
not
stood
together
forming
the
left
wing
of
the
it
was
now
their
turn
to
declare
themselves
was
the
first
about
whose
signing
the
commissioner
entertained
any
doubt
there
was
a
pause
significant
of
apprehension
it
is
your
turn
jumper
said
the
latter
at
length
addressing
the
chief
by
his
english
name
you
may
me
then
replied
the
eloquent
and
witty
chief
making
a
jest
of
what
he
meant
for
earnest
as
well
how
you
refuse
to
sign
does
not
write
it
is
not
necessary
your
name
is
already
written
you
have
only
to
place
your
finger
upon
it
i
might
put
my
finger
on
the
wrong
place
you
can
sign
by
making
a
cross
continued
the
agent
still
in
hopes
that
the
chief
would
consent
we
seminoles
have
but
little
liking
for
the
cross
we
had
enough
of
it
in
the
days
of
the
spaniards
then
you
positively
refuse
to
sign
ho
mister
commissioner
does
it
surprise
you
be
it
so
then
now
hear
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
ears
are
as
open
as
the
commissioner
mouth
was
the
sneering
rejoinder
i
depose
from
the
chieftainship
of
his
clan
the
great
father
will
no
longer
recognise
him
as
chief
of
the
seminoles
ha
ha
ha
came
the
scornful
laugh
in
reply
indeed
indeed
and
tell
me
he
asked
still
continuing
to
laugh
and
treating
with
derision
the
solemn
enunciation
of
the
commissioner
of
whom
am
i
to
be
chief
general
thompson
i
have
pronounced
said
the
agent
evidently
confused
and
nettled
by
the
ironical
manner
of
the
indian
you
are
no
more
a
chief
we
will
not
acknowledge
you
as
one
but
my
people
what
of
them
asked
the
other
in
a
fine
tone
of
irony
have
they
nothing
to
say
in
this
matter
your
people
will
act
with
reason
they
will
listen
to
their
great
father
advice
they
will
no
longer
obey
a
leader
who
has
acted
without
faith
you
say
truly
agent
replied
the
chief
now
speaking
seriously
my
people
will
act
with
reason
but
they
will
also
act
with
patriotism
and
fidelity
do
not
flatter
yourself
on
the
potency
of
our
great
advice
if
it
be
given
as
a
father
counsel
they
will
listen
to
it
if
not
they
will
shut
their
ears
against
it
as
to
your
disposal
of
myself
i
only
laugh
at
the
absurdity
of
the
act
i
treat
both
act
and
agent
with
scorn
i
have
no
dread
of
your
power
i
have
no
fear
of
the
loyalty
of
my
people
sow
dissension
among
them
as
you
please
you
have
been
successful
elsewhere
in
making
traitors
here
the
speaker
glared
towards
omatla
and
his
warriors
but
i
disregard
your
machinations
there
is
not
a
man
in
my
tribe
that
will
turn
his
back
upon
not
one
the
orator
ceased
speaking
and
folding
his
arms
fell
back
into
an
attitude
of
silent
defiance
he
saw
that
the
commissioner
had
done
with
him
for
the
latter
was
now
appealing
to
abram
for
his
signature
the
black
first
answer
was
a
decided
negative
simply
no
when
urged
to
repeat
his
refusal
he
added
no
by
jovah
i
nebber
sign
the
damned
paper
nebber
dat
enuf
aint
it
bossy
thompson
of
course
this
put
an
end
to
the
appeal
and
abram
was
scratched
from
the
list
of
chiefs
arpiucki
followed
next
and
cloud
and
the
alligator
and
then
the
dwarf
poshalla
all
these
refused
their
signatures
and
were
in
turn
formally
deposed
from
their
dignities
so
likewise
were
holata
mico
and
others
who
were
absent
most
of
the
chiefs
only
laughed
as
they
listened
to
the
wholesale
cashiering
it
was
ludicrous
enough
to
hear
this
puny
office
holder
of
an
hour
pronounce
edicts
with
all
the
easy
freedom
of
an
emperor
note
poshala
the
last
who
had
been
disgraced
laughed
like
the
others
but
the
dwarf
had
a
bitter
tongue
and
could
not
refrain
from
a
rejoinder
tell
the
fat
agent
cried
he
to
the
interpreter
tell
him
that
i
shall
be
chief
of
the
seminoles
when
the
rank
weeds
are
growing
over
his
great
carcass
ha
ha
the
rough
speech
was
not
carried
to
the
ears
of
the
commissioner
he
did
not
even
hear
the
scornful
cachinnation
that
followed
it
for
his
attention
was
now
entirely
occupied
with
one
individual
the
youngest
of
the
chiefs
the
last
in
the
line
osceola
note
the
united
states
government
afterwards
disapproved
of
this
absurd
dethronement
of
the
chiefs
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
thompson
acted
under
secret
instructions
from
the
president
chapter
thirty
nine
the
signature
of
osceola
up
to
this
moment
the
young
chief
had
scarcely
spoken
only
when
charles
omatla
took
hold
of
the
pen
he
had
hissed
out
the
word
traitor
he
had
not
remained
all
the
time
in
the
same
attitude
neither
had
his
countenance
shown
him
indifferent
to
what
was
passing
there
was
no
constraint
either
in
his
gestures
or
looks
no
air
of
affected
stoicism
for
this
was
not
his
character
he
had
laughed
at
the
wit
of
jumper
and
applauded
the
patriotism
of
abram
and
the
others
as
heartily
as
he
had
frowned
disapproval
of
the
conduct
of
the
traitors
it
was
now
his
turn
to
declare
himself
and
he
stood
with
modest
mien
in
the
expectation
of
being
asked
all
the
others
had
been
appealed
to
by
name
for
the
names
of
all
were
to
the
agent
and
his
interpreters
i
need
hardly
state
that
at
this
crisis
silence
was
on
tiptoe
throughout
the
ranks
of
the
soldiery
throughout
the
crowd
of
warriors
everywhere
there
was
a
moment
of
breathless
expectancy
as
if
every
individual
upon
the
ground
was
imbued
with
the
presentiment
of
a
scene
for
my
part
i
felt
satisfied
that
an
explosion
was
about
to
take
place
and
like
the
rest
i
stood
with
expectation
the
commissioner
broke
the
silence
with
the
words
at
last
we
have
come
to
you
before
proceeding
further
let
me
ask
are
you
acknowledged
as
a
there
was
insult
in
the
tone
the
manner
the
words
it
was
direct
and
intended
as
the
countenance
of
the
speaker
clearly
showed
there
was
malice
in
his
eye
malice
mingled
with
the
confidence
of
prospective
triumph
the
interrogation
was
irrelevant
superfluous
thompson
knew
well
that
powell
was
a
chief
a
it
is
true
but
still
a
chief
a
of
the
redsticks
the
most
warlike
tribe
of
the
nation
the
question
was
put
for
mere
provocation
the
agent
tempted
an
outburst
of
that
temper
that
all
knew
to
be
none
of
the
gentlest
strange
to
say
the
insult
failed
in
its
effect
or
it
seemed
so
they
who
expected
an
angry
answer
were
doomed
to
disappointment
osceola
made
no
reply
only
a
peculiar
smile
was
observed
upon
his
features
it
was
not
of
anger
nor
yet
of
scorn
it
was
rather
a
smile
of
silent
lordly
contempt
the
look
which
a
gentleman
would
bestow
upon
a
blackguard
who
is
abusing
him
those
who
witnessed
it
were
left
under
the
impression
that
the
young
chief
regarded
his
insulter
as
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
reply
and
the
insult
too
gross
as
it
really
was
to
be
answered
such
impression
had
i
in
common
with
others
around
me
osceola
look
might
have
silenced
the
commissioner
or
at
least
have
caused
him
to
have
changed
his
tactics
had
he
been
at
all
sensitive
to
derision
but
no
the
vulgar
soul
of
the
plebeian
official
was
closed
against
shame
as
against
justice
and
without
regarding
the
repulse
he
pressed
on
with
his
plan
i
ask
are
you
a
chief
continued
he
repeating
the
interrogatory
in
a
still
more
insulting
tone
have
you
the
right
to
sign
this
time
his
questions
were
answered
and
by
a
dozen
voices
at
once
chieftains
in
the
ring
and
warriors
who
stood
behind
it
shouted
in
reply
the
rising
sun
a
chief
he
a
chief
he
has
the
right
to
sign
why
call
his
right
in
question
inquired
jumper
with
a
sneering
laugh
time
enough
when
he
wishes
to
exercise
it
he
is
not
likely
to
do
that
now
but
i
am
said
osceola
addressing
himself
to
the
orator
and
speaking
with
marked
emphasis
i
have
the
right
to
sign
shall
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
effect
produced
by
this
unexpected
avowal
the
entire
audience
white
men
as
well
as
red
men
was
taken
by
surprise
and
for
some
moments
there
was
a
vibratory
movement
throughout
the
assembly
accompanied
by
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
exclamations
were
heard
on
all
sides
cries
of
varied
import
according
to
the
political
bias
of
those
who
uttered
them
all
however
betokened
astonishment
with
some
in
tones
of
joy
with
others
in
the
accents
of
chagrin
or
anger
was
it
osceola
who
had
spoken
had
they
heard
aright
was
the
rising
sun
so
soon
to
sink
behind
the
clouds
after
all
that
had
transpired
after
all
he
had
promised
was
going
to
turn
traitor
such
questions
passed
rapidly
among
the
hostile
chiefs
and
warriors
while
those
of
the
opposite
party
could
scarcely
conceal
their
delight
all
knew
that
the
signing
of
osceola
would
end
the
affair
and
the
removal
become
a
matter
of
coarse
the
omatlas
would
have
nothing
more
to
fear
the
hostile
warriors
who
had
sworn
it
might
still
resist
but
there
was
no
leader
among
them
who
could
bind
the
patriots
together
as
osceola
had
done
with
this
defection
the
spirit
of
resistance
would
become
a
feeble
thing
the
patriots
might
despair
jumper
cloud
coa
hajo
and
abram
arpiucki
and
the
dwarf
seemed
all
equally
stricken
with
astonishment
osceola
he
on
whom
they
had
reposed
their
fullest
confidence
the
bold
designer
of
the
opposition
the
open
foe
to
all
who
had
hitherto
advocated
the
removal
he
the
pure
patriot
in
whom
all
had
believed
whom
all
had
trusted
was
now
going
to
desert
them
now
in
the
eleventh
hour
when
his
defection
would
be
fatal
to
their
cause
he
has
been
bribed
said
they
his
patriotism
has
been
all
a
sham
his
resistance
a
cheat
he
has
been
bought
by
the
agent
he
has
been
acting
for
him
all
along
bad
man
villain
is
a
treason
blacker
than
omatla
thus
muttered
the
chiefs
to
one
another
at
the
same
time
eyeing
osceola
with
the
fierce
look
of
tigers
with
regard
to
powell
defection
i
did
not
myself
know
what
to
make
of
it
he
had
declared
his
resolution
to
sign
the
treaty
what
more
was
needed
that
he
was
ready
to
do
so
was
evident
from
his
attitude
he
seemed
only
to
wait
for
the
agent
to
invite
him
as
to
the
commissioner
being
a
party
to
this
intention
i
knew
he
was
nothing
of
the
kind
any
one
who
looked
in
his
face
at
that
moment
would
have
acquitted
him
of
all
privity
to
the
act
he
was
evidently
as
much
astonished
by
osceola
declaration
as
any
one
upon
the
ground
or
even
more
so
in
fact
he
seemed
bewildered
by
the
unexpected
avowal
so
much
so
that
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
make
rejoinder
he
at
length
stammered
out
very
well
osceola
step
forward
here
and
sign
then
thompson
tone
was
changed
he
spoke
soothingly
a
new
prospect
was
before
him
osceola
would
sign
and
thus
agree
to
the
removal
the
business
upon
which
the
supreme
government
had
deputed
him
would
thus
be
accomplished
and
with
a
dexterity
that
would
redound
to
his
own
credit
old
hickory
would
be
satisfied
and
then
what
next
what
next
not
a
mission
to
a
mere
tribe
of
savages
but
an
embassy
to
some
high
court
of
civilisation
he
might
yet
be
ambassador
perhaps
to
spain
ah
wiley
thompson
thy
castles
in
the
air
en
were
soon
dissipated
they
fell
as
suddenly
as
they
had
been
built
they
broke
down
like
a
house
of
cards
osceola
stepped
forward
to
the
table
and
bent
over
it
as
if
to
scan
the
words
of
the
document
his
eyes
ran
rapidly
across
the
parchment
he
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
particular
place
he
found
it
it
was
a
name
he
read
it
aloud
charles
omatla
raising
himself
erect
he
faced
the
commissioner
and
in
a
tone
of
irony
asked
the
latter
if
he
still
desired
him
to
sign
you
have
promised
osceola
then
will
i
keep
my
promise
as
he
spoke
the
words
he
drew
his
long
spanish
knife
from
its
sheath
and
raising
it
aloft
struck
the
blade
through
the
parchment
till
its
point
was
deep
buried
in
the
wood
that
is
my
signature
cried
he
as
he
drew
forth
the
steel
see
omatla
it
is
through
name
beware
traitor
undo
what
you
have
done
or
its
blade
may
yet
pass
through
your
heart
oh
that
is
what
he
meant
cried
the
commissioner
rising
in
rage
good
i
was
prepared
for
this
insolence
this
outrage
general
clinch
i
appeal
to
you
your
soldiers
seize
upon
him
arrest
him
these
broken
speeches
i
heard
amidst
the
confusion
of
voices
i
heard
clinch
issue
some
hurried
orders
to
an
officer
who
stood
near
i
saw
half
a
dozen
files
separate
from
the
ranks
and
rush
forward
i
saw
them
cluster
around
osceola
who
the
next
moment
was
in
their
grasp
not
till
several
of
the
soldiers
were
sent
sprawling
over
the
ground
not
till
guns
had
been
thrown
aside
and
a
dozen
strong
men
had
fixed
their
gripe
upon
him
did
the
young
chief
give
over
his
desperate
struggles
to
escape
and
then
apparently
yielding
he
stood
rigid
and
immobile
as
if
his
frame
had
been
iron
it
was
an
unexpected
alike
unlooked
for
by
either
white
men
or
indians
it
was
a
violent
proceeding
and
altogether
unjustifiable
this
was
no
court
whose
judge
had
the
right
to
arrest
for
contempt
it
was
a
council
and
even
the
insolence
of
an
individual
could
not
be
punished
without
the
concurrence
of
both
parties
general
thompson
had
exceeded
his
duty
he
had
exercised
a
power
arbitrary
as
illegal
the
scene
that
followed
was
so
confused
as
to
defy
description
the
air
was
rent
with
loud
ejaculations
the
shouts
of
men
the
screams
of
the
women
the
cries
of
children
the
yells
of
the
indian
warriors
fell
simultaneously
upon
the
ear
there
was
no
attempt
at
rescue
that
would
have
been
impossible
in
the
presence
of
so
many
troops
so
many
traitors
but
the
patriot
chiefs
as
they
hurried
away
from
the
ground
gave
out
their
wild
the
gathering
of
the
seminole
nation
that
in
every
utterance
promised
retaliation
and
revenge
the
soldiers
commenced
dragging
osceola
inside
the
fort
tyrant
cried
he
fixing
his
eye
upon
the
commissioner
you
have
triumphed
by
treachery
but
fancy
not
that
this
is
the
end
of
it
you
may
imprison
osceola
hang
him
if
you
will
but
think
not
that
his
spirit
will
die
no
it
will
live
and
cry
aloud
for
vengeance
it
speaks
hear
ye
yonder
sounds
know
ye
the
of
the
redsticks
mark
it
well
for
it
is
not
the
last
time
it
will
ring
in
your
ears
listen
to
it
tyrant
it
is
your
it
is
your
while
giving
utterance
to
these
wild
threats
the
young
chief
was
drawn
through
the
gate
and
hurried
off
to
the
within
the
stockade
as
i
followed
amid
the
crowd
some
one
touched
me
on
the
arm
as
if
to
draw
my
attention
turning
i
beheld
by
the
spring
pond
water
said
she
speaking
so
as
not
to
be
heard
by
those
around
there
will
be
shadows
more
shadows
upon
the
water
perhaps
i
did
not
hear
more
the
crowd
pressed
us
apart
and
when
i
looked
again
the
mad
queen
had
moved
away
from
the
spot
chapter
forty
fighting
gallagher
the
prisoner
was
confined
in
a
strong
windowless
blockhouse
access
to
him
would
be
easy
enough
especially
to
those
who
wore
epaulets
it
was
my
design
to
visit
him
but
for
certain
reasons
i
forbore
putting
it
in
execution
so
long
as
daylight
lasted
i
was
desirous
that
my
interview
should
be
as
private
as
possible
and
therefore
waited
for
the
night
i
was
influenced
by
other
reasons
my
hands
were
full
of
business
i
had
not
yet
done
with
arens
ringgold
i
had
a
difficulty
in
deciding
how
to
act
my
mind
was
a
chaos
of
emotions
hatred
for
the
conspirators
indignation
at
the
unjust
behaviour
of
the
agent
towards
osceola
love
for
maumee
now
fond
and
trusting
anon
doubting
and
jealous
amid
such
confusion
how
could
i
think
with
clearness
withal
one
of
these
emotions
had
precedence
anger
against
the
villain
who
intended
to
take
my
life
was
at
that
moment
the
strongest
passion
in
my
breast
hostility
so
heartless
so
causeless
so
deadly
had
not
failed
to
imbue
me
with
a
keen
desire
for
vengeance
and
i
resolved
to
punish
my
enemy
at
all
hazards
he
only
whose
life
has
been
aimed
at
by
an
assassin
can
understand
the
deadly
antipathy
i
felt
towards
arens
ringgold
an
open
enemy
who
acts
under
the
impulse
of
anger
jealousy
or
fancied
wrong
you
may
respect
even
the
two
white
wretches
and
the
yellow
runaway
i
regarded
only
with
contempt
as
tools
pliant
for
any
purpose
but
the
himself
i
now
both
hated
and
despised
so
acute
was
my
sense
of
injury
that
i
could
not
permit
it
to
pass
without
some
act
of
retaliation
some
effort
to
punish
my
wronger
but
how
therein
lay
the
uncertainty
how
a
duel
i
could
think
of
no
other
way
the
criminal
was
still
inside
the
law
i
could
not
reach
him
otherwise
than
by
my
own
arm
i
well
weighed
the
words
of
my
sable
counsellor
but
the
faithful
fellow
had
spoken
in
vain
and
i
resolved
to
act
contrary
to
his
advice
let
the
hazard
fall
as
it
might
i
made
up
my
mind
to
the
challenge
one
consideration
still
caused
me
to
hesitate
must
give
ringgold
my
he
should
have
been
welcome
to
them
as
a
dying
souvenir
but
if
i
succeeded
in
only
him
or
he
in
me
how
about
the
future
i
should
be
showing
my
hand
to
him
by
which
he
would
profit
whereas
unknown
to
him
i
now
knew
his
and
might
easily
foil
his
designs
such
calculations
ran
rapidly
through
my
mind
though
i
considered
them
with
a
coolness
that
in
surprises
me
the
incidents
that
i
had
lately
encountered
combined
with
angry
hatred
of
this
plausible
villain
had
made
me
fierce
cold
and
cruel
i
was
no
longer
myself
and
wicked
as
it
may
appear
i
could
not
control
my
longings
for
vengeance
i
needed
a
friend
to
advise
me
who
could
i
make
the
confidant
of
my
terrible
secret
surely
my
ears
were
not
deceiving
me
no
it
was
the
voice
of
my
old
charley
gallagher
i
heard
it
outside
and
recognised
the
ring
of
his
merry
laugh
a
detachment
of
rifles
had
just
entered
the
fort
with
charley
at
their
head
in
another
instant
we
had
embraced
what
could
have
been
more
opportune
charley
had
been
my
chum
at
college
my
bosom
companion
he
deserved
my
confidence
and
almost
upon
the
instant
i
made
known
to
him
the
situation
of
affairs
it
required
much
explanation
to
remove
his
incredulity
he
was
disposed
to
treat
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
that
is
the
conspiracy
against
my
life
but
the
rifle
shot
was
real
and
black
jake
was
by
to
confirm
my
account
of
it
so
that
my
friend
was
at
length
induced
to
take
a
serious
view
of
the
matter
bad
luck
to
me
said
he
in
irish
accent
it
the
quarest
case
that
ever
came
accrast
your
humble
frind
experience
mother
o
moses
the
fellow
must
be
the
divil
incarnate
geordie
my
boy
have
ye
looked
under
his
instip
despite
the
name
and
brogue
charley
was
not
a
hibernian
only
the
son
of
one
he
was
a
by
birth
and
could
speak
good
english
when
he
pleased
but
from
some
freak
of
eccentricity
or
affectation
he
had
taken
to
the
brogue
and
used
it
habitually
when
among
friends
with
all
the
rich
garniture
of
a
true
milesian
fresh
from
the
sod
he
was
altogether
an
odd
fellow
but
with
a
soul
of
honour
and
a
heart
true
as
steel
he
was
no
dunce
either
and
the
man
above
all
others
upon
whose
coat
tail
it
would
not
have
been
safe
to
trid
he
was
already
notorious
for
having
been
engaged
in
two
or
three
affairs
in
which
he
had
played
both
principal
and
second
and
had
earned
the
bellicose
appellation
of
fighting
gallagher
i
knew
what
advice
would
be
before
asking
it
call
the
schoundrel
out
by
all
manes
i
stated
the
difficulty
as
to
my
reasons
for
challenging
ringgold
thrue
you
right
there
but
there
need
be
no
throuble
about
the
matther
how
make
the
spalpeen
challenge
you
that
betther
besides
it
gives
you
the
choice
of
waypons
in
what
way
can
i
do
this
och
my
innocent
gossoon
shure
that
as
asy
as

haycock
call
him
a
liar
an
if

not
sufficiently
disagraable
twake
his
nose
or
squirt
your
tobacco
in
his
ugly
countenance
fetch
him
out
i
be
bail
for
ye
come
along
my
boy
continued
my
ready
counsellor
moving
towards
the
door
where
is
this
mister
ringgowld
to
be
sarched
for
find
me
the
gint
and
i
shew
you
how
to
scratch
his
buttons
come
along
wid
ye
not
much
liking
the
plan
of
procedure
but
without
the
moral
strength
to
resist
i
followed
this
impetuous
son
of
a
celt
through
the
doorway
chapter
forty
one
provoking
a
duel
we
were
scarcely
outside
before
we
saw
him
for
whom
we
were
searching
he
was
standing
at
a
short
distance
from
the
porch
conversing
with
a
group
of
officers
among
whom
was
the
dandy
already
alluded
to
and
who
passed
under
the
appropriate
appellation
of
beau
scott
the
latter
was
to
the
of
whom
he
was
also
a
relative
i
pointed
ringgold
out
to
my
companion
he
in
the
civilian
dress
i
said
och
man
ye
need
be
so
purticular
in
your
idintification
that
spakes
for
itself
be
my
sowl
it
an
unwholesome
look
altogither
that
fellow
need
fear
wather
the
say
niver
drown
now
look
here
geordy
boy
continued
gallagher
facing
towards
me
and
speaking
in
a
more
earnest
tone
follow
my
advice
to
the
letther
first
trid
upon
his
toes
an
see
how
he
takes
it
the
fellow
got
corns
do
ye
see
he
wears
a
tight
boot
give
him
a
good
scrouge
make
him
sing
out
ov
course
he
ask
you
to
apologise
he
must
you
wo
shurely
that
do
the
bizness
without
farther
ceremony
if
it
do
then
by
jabus
hit
him
a
kick
in
the
latter
end
no
gallagher
said
i
disliking
the
programme
it
will
never
do
bad
luck
to
it
an
why
not
you
not
going
to
back
out
are
ye
think
man
a
villain
who
would
murdher
you
an
maybe
will
some
day
if
you
let
him
escape
true
but
bah
no
buts
move
up
an
let
see
what
they
talking
about
anyhow
i
find
ye
a
chance
or
my
name
not
gallagher
undetermined
how
to
act
i
walked
after
my
companion
and
joined
the
group
of
officers
of
course
i
had
no
thoughts
of
following
gallagher
advice
i
was
in
hopes
that
some
turn
in
the
conversation
might
give
me
the
opportunity
i
desired
without
proceeding
to
such
rude
extremes
my
hopes
did
not
deceive
me
arens
ringgold
seemed
to
tempt
his
fate
for
i
had
scarcely
entered
among
the
crowd
before
i
found
cause
sufficient
for
my
purpose
talking
of
indian
beauties
said
he
no
one
has
been
so
successful
among
them
as
scott
here
he
has
been
playing
don
giovanni
ever
since
he
came
to
the
fort
oh
exclaimed
one
of
the
newly
arrived
officers
that
does
not
surprise
us
he
has
been
a
ever
since
i
knew
him
the
man
who
is
irresistible
among
the
belles
of
saratoga
will
surely
find
little
difficulty
in
carrying
the
heart
of
an
indian
maiden
do
be
so
confident
about
that
captain
roberts
sometimes
these
forest
damsels
are
very
shy
of
us
lovers
lieutenant
present
sweetheart
cost
him
a
long
siege
before
he
could
conquer
her
is
it
not
so
lieutenant
nonsense
replied
the
dandy
with
a
conceited
smirk
but
she
yielded
at
last
said
roberts
turning
interrogatively
towards
scott
the
dandy
made
no
reply
but
his
simpering
smile
was
evidently
intended
to
be
taken
in
the
affirmative
oh
yes
rejoined
ringgold
she
yielded
at
last
and
is
now
the
it
is
said
her
name
her
name
powell
miss
powell
what
that
name
is
not
indian
no
gentlemen
the
lady
is
no
savage
i
assure
you
she
can
play
and
sing
and
read
and
write
too
such
pretty
is
it
not
so
lieutenant
before
the
latter
could
make
reply
another
spoke
is
not
that
the
name
of
the
young
chief
who
has
just
been
arrested
true
answered
ringgold
it
is
the
fellow
name
i
had
forgotten
to
say
that
she
is
his
sister
what
the
sister
of
osceola
neither
more
nor
less
like
him
too
among
the
whites
they
are
known
by
the
name
of
powell
since
that
was
the
cognomen
of
the
worthy
old
gentleman
who
begot
them
osceola
which
signifies
rising
sun
is
the
name
by
which
he
is
known
among
the
seminoles
and
native
appellation
ah
that
is
a
very
pretty
name
indeed
what
is
it
let
us
hear
it
let
us
judge
for
ourselves
maumee
very
pretty
indeed
beautiful
if
the
damsel
be
only
as
sweet
as
her
name
then
scott
is
a
fortunate
fellow
oh
she
is
a
very
wonder
of
beauty
eyes
liquid
and
full
of
fiery
love
long
lashes
lips
luscious
as
honeycombs
figure
tall
bust
full
and
firm
limbs
like
those
of
the
cyprian
goddess
feet
like
cinderella
in
short
perfection
wonderful
why
scott
you
are
the
luckiest
mortal
alive
but
say
ringgold
are
you
speaking
in
seriousness
has
he
really
conquered
this
indian
divinity
honour
bright
he
you
understand
what
i
mean
was
the
prompt
reply
up
to
this
moment
i
had
not
interfered
the
first
words
of
the
conversation
had
bound
me
like
a
spell
and
i
stood
as
if
glued
to
the
ground
my
brain
was
giddy
and
my
heart
felt
as
if
the
blood
passing
through
it
was
molten
lead
the
bold
enunciations
had
so
staggered
me
that
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
draw
my
breath
and
more
than
one
of
the
bystanders
noticed
the
effect
which
the
dialogue
was
producing
on
me
after
a
little
i
grew
calmer
or
rather
more
resolute
the
very
despair
that
had
passed
into
my
bosom
had
the
effect
of
steeling
my
nerves
and
just
as
ringgold
uttered
the
flippant
affirmative
i
was
ready
for
him
liar
i
exclaimed
and
before
the
red
could
mount
into
his
cheek
i
gave
it
a
slap
with
the
back
of
my
hand
that
no
doubt
helped
to
heighten
the
colour
nately
done
cried
gallagher
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
the
maynin
of
that
nor
was
there
my
antagonist
accepted
the
act
for
what
it
was
meant
a
deadly
insult
in
such
company
he
could
not
do
otherwise
and
muttering
some
indistinct
threats
he
walked
away
from
the
ground
attended
by
his
especial
friend
the
and
two
or
three
others
the
incident
instead
of
gathering
a
crowd
had
the
contrary
effect
it
scattered
the
little
group
who
had
witnessed
it
the
officers
retiring
to
discuss
the
motives
and
speculate
as
as
to
when
and
where
the
affair
would
come
off
gallagher
and
i
also
left
the
ground
and
closeted
in
my
quarters
commenced
preparing
for
the
event
chapter
forty
two
the
challenge
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
duelling
was
not
uncommon
in
the
united
states
army
in
it
is
not
uncommon
yet
as
i
can
testify
from
late
experience
it
is
contrary
to
the
regulations
of
the
american
service
as
i
believe
it
is
of
every
other
in
the
civilised
world
notwithstanding
an
infringement
of
the
in
this
regard
is
usually
looked
upon
with
leniency
more
often
winked
at
than
punished
this
much
i
can
affirm
that
any
officer
in
the
american
army
who
has
received
the
lie
direct
will
find
more
honour
in
the
breach
of
this
military
rule
than
in
its
observance
after
all
that
has
been
said
and
written
about
duelling
the
outcry
against
it
is
a
sad
sham
at
least
in
the
united
states
of
america
nothing
less
than
a
piece
of
superb
hypocrisy
universal
as
has
been
this
condemnation
i
should
not
like
to
take
shelter
under
it
i
well
know
that
it
would
not
protect
me
from
being
called
by
that
ugly
appellation
poltroon
i
have
noticed
over
and
over
again
that
the
newspapers
loudest
in
their
declamations
against
duelling
are
the
first
to
fling
coward
in
the
teeth
of
him
who
refuses
to
fight
it
is
even
so
in
america
moral
courage
though
much
does
not
find
ready
credence
a
refusal
to
meet
the
man
who
may
challenge
you
is
not
thus
explained
it
is
called
backing
out
shewing
the
white
feather
and
he
who
does
this
need
look
no
more
upon
his
she
would
flog
him
with
her
garters
more
than
once
have
i
heard
this
threat
spoken
by
pretty
lips
and
in
the
centre
of
a
brilliant
circle
his
moral
courage
must
be
great
who
would
provoke
such
chastisement
with
such
a
sentiment
over
the
land
then
i
had
nailed
arens
ringgold
for
a
meeting
and
i
joyed
to
think
i
had
done
so
without
compromising
my
secret
but
ah
it
was
a
painful
provocation
he
had
given
me
and
if
he
had
been
the
greatest
coward
in
the
world
he
could
not
have
been
more
wretched
than
i
as
i
returned
to
my
quarters
my
jovial
companion
could
no
longer
cheer
me
though
it
was
not
fear
for
the
coming
fight
that
clouded
my
spirits
far
from
it
far
otherwise
i
scarcely
thought
of
that
my
thoughts
were
of
maumee
of
what
i
had
just
heard
she
was
false
false
betraying
herself
betrayed
lost
lost
forever
in
truth
was
i
wretched
one
thing
alone
could
have
rendered
me
more
so
an
obstacle
to
the
anticipated
meeting
anything
to
hinder
my
revenge
on
the
duel
now
rested
my
hopes
it
might
enable
me
to
disembarrass
my
heart
of
the
hot
blood
that
was
burning
it
not
all
unless
he
too
stood
before
me
he
the
seducer
who
had
made
this
misery
would
i
could
find
pretext
for
challenging
him
i
should
do
so
yet
why
had
i
not
why
did
i
not
strike
him
for
that
smile
i
could
have
fought
them
both
at
the
same
time
one
after
the
other
thus
i
raved
with
gallagher
by
my
side
my
friend
knew
not
all
my
secret
he
asked
what
i
had
got
aginst
the
say
the
word
geordie
boy
an
we
make
a
game
ov
it
be
saint
pathrick
i
like
mightily
to
take
the
shine
out
of
that
purty
paycock
no
gallagher
no
it
not
your
affair
you
could
not
give
satisfaction
for
that
let
us
wait
till
we
know
more
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
believe
it
believe
what
not
now
my
friend
when
it
is
over
i
shall
explain
all
right
my
boy
charley
gallagher
not
the
man
to
disturb
your
saycrets
now
let
look
to
the
an
make
shure
they
in
barking
condition
i
hope
the
scamps
wo
blab
at
disappoint
us
after
all
it
was
my
only
fear
i
knew
that
arrest
was
possible
probable
certain
if
my
adversary
wished
it
arrest
would
put
an
end
to
the
affair
and
i
should
be
left
in
a
worse
position
than
ever
father
was
gone
i
had
ascertained
this
favourable
circumstance
but
no
matter
the
was
the
friend
of
the
family
a
word
in
his
ear
would
be
sufficient
i
feared
that
the
scott
instructed
by
arens
might
whisper
that
word
after
all
he
dare
said
gallagher
you
driv
the
nail
home
clinched
it
he
dare
do
the
dhirty
thing
not
a
bit
of
it
it
might
get
wind
an
thin
he
have
the
kettle
to
his
tail
besides
he
wants
to
kill
you
anyhow
so
he
ought
to
be
glad
of
the
fine
handy
chance
you
given
him
he
not
a
bad
shot
they
say
never
fear
geordie
boy
he
wo
back
out
this
time
he
must
fight
he
will
fight
ha
i
told
you
so
see
yonder
comes
apollo
belvidare
holy
moses
how
phoebus
shines
a
knock
come
in
the
door
was
opened
and
the
appeared
in
full
uniform
to
arrest
me
thought
i
and
my
heart
fell
but
no
the
freshly
written
note
spoke
a
different
purpose
and
i
was
relieved
it
was
the
challenge
lieutenant
randolph
i
believe
said
the
gentleman
advancing
towards
me
i
pointed
to
gallagher
but
made
no
reply
i
am
to
understand
that
captain
gallagher
is
your
friend
i
nodded
assent
the
two
faced
each
other
and
the
next
instant
were
talking
the
matter
over
as
cool
as
cucumbers
and
sweet
as
from
observation
i
hazard
this
remark
that
the
politeness
exhibited
between
the
seconds
in
a
duel
can
not
be
surpassed
by
that
of
the
most
accomplished
courtiers
in
the
world
the
time
occupied
in
the
business
was
brief
gallagher
well
knew
the
routine
and
i
saw
that
the
other
was
not
entirely
unacquainted
with
it
in
five
minutes
everything
was
arranged
place
weapons
and
distance
i
nodded
gallagher
made
a
sweeping
salaam
the
bowed
stiffly
and
withdrew
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
my
reflections
previous
to
the
duel
nor
yet
with
many
details
of
the
affair
itself
accounts
of
these
deadly
encounters
are
common
enough
in
books
and
their
sameness
will
serve
as
my
excuse
for
not
describing
one
ours
differed
only
from
the
ordinary
kind
in
the
weapon
used
we
fought
with
instead
of
swords
or
pistols
it
was
my
choice
as
the
challenged
party
i
had
the
right
but
it
was
equally
agreeable
to
my
adversary
who
was
as
well
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
rifle
as
i
chose
this
weapon
because
it
was
the
the
time
arranged
was
an
hour
before
sunset
i
had
urged
this
early
meeting
in
fear
of
interruption
the
place
a
spot
of
level
ground
near
the
edge
of
the
little
pond
where
i
had
met
the
distance
ten
paces
we
met
took
our
places
back
to
back
waited
for
the
ominous
signal
one
two
three
received
it
faced
rapidly
round
and
fired
at
each
other
i
heard
the
hist
of
the
leaden
pellet
as
it
passed
my
ear
but
felt
no
stroke
the
smoke
puffed
upward
i
saw
my
antagonist
upon
the
ground
he
was
not
dead
he
was
writhing
and
groaning
the
seconds
and
several
spectators
who
were
present
ran
up
to
him
but
i
kept
my
ground
well
gallagher
i
asked
as
my
friend
came
back
to
me
winged
by
japers
you
spoilt
the
use
ov
his
dexter
arm
bone
broke
above
the
that
all
arrah
sowl
are
it
enough
hear
how
the
hound
whimpers
i
felt
as
the
tiger
is
said
to
feel
after
tasting
blood
though
i
can
not
now
account
for
my
ferocity
the
man
had
sought
my
life
i
thirsted
for
his
this
combined
with
the
other
thought
had
nigh
driven
me
mad
i
was
not
satisfied
and
would
make
no
apology
but
my
antagonist
had
had
enough
he
was
eager
to
be
taken
from
the
ground
on
any
terms
and
thus
the
affair
ended
it
was
my
first
duel
but
not
my
last
chapter
forty
three
the
assignation
our
opponents
passed
silently
away
the
spectators
along
with
them
leaving
my
second
and
myself
upon
the
ground
it
was
my
intention
to
stay
by
the
pond
i
remembered
the
invitation
of
by
remaining
i
should
avoid
the
double
journey
better
to
await
her
coming
a
glance
to
the
western
horizon
shewed
me
that
the
sun
had
already
sunk
below
the
the
twilight
would
be
short
the
young
moon
was
already
in
the
heavens
it
might
be
only
a
few
minutes
before
should
come
i
resolved
to
stay
i
desired
not
that
gallagher
should
be
with
me
and
i
expressed
the
wish
to
be
left
alone
my
companion
was
a
little
surprised
and
puzzled
at
the
request
but
he
was
too
well
bred
not
to
yield
instant
compliance
why
geordie
boy
said
he
about
to
retire
shurely
something
the
matther
wid
ye
it
is
this
thrifling
spurt
we
been
engaged
in
did
it
ind
intirely
to
your
satisfaction
arrah
man
are
ye
sorry
you
did
kill
him
dead
be
my
trath
you
look
as
milancholic
and
as
if
he
had
killed
dear
friend
leave
me
alone
on
my
return
to
quarters
you
shall
know
the
cause
of
my
melancholy
and
why
i
now
desire
to
part
from
your
pleasant
company
oh
that
part
i
can
guess
rejoined
he
with
a
significant
laugh
always
a
petticoat
where
there
shots
exchanged
niver
mind
my
boy
no
saycrets
for
charley
gallagher
i
bad
at
keepin
them
ov
coorse
you
going
to
meet
betther
company
than
mine
but
laste
you
might
fall
in
with
worse
an
by
my
sowl
from
what
ye
towld
me
that
same
beyond
the
bounds
of
probability
take
this
little
cheeper
i
a
great
you
know
here
the
speaker
handed
me
a
silver
call
which
he
had
plucked
from
his
button
if
any
thing
inconvenient
or
disagraable
should
turn
up
put
that
between
your
lips
an
charley
gallagher
will
be
at
your
side
in
the
mention
of
jack
robison
name
cupid
spade
ye
with
your
i
go
an
kill
time
over
a
tumbler
ov
nagus
till
ye
come
so
saying
my
friend
left
me
to
myself
i
ceased
to
think
of
him
ere
he
was
gone
out
of
sight
even
the
bloody
strife
in
which
i
had
been
so
recently
engaged
glided
out
of
my
mind
maumee
her
falsehood
and
her
fall
alone
occupied
my
thoughts
for
a
long
while
i
made
no
doubt
of
what
i
had
heard
how
could
i
with
proofs
so
circumstantial
the
testimony
of
those
cognisant
of
the
scandal
of
the
chief
actor
in
it
whose
silent
smile
spoke
stronger
than
words
that
smile
of
insolent
triumph
why
had
i
permitted
it
to
pass
without
challenge
without
rebuke
it
was
not
too
late
i
should
call
upon
him
to
speak
plainly
and
point
blank
yes
or
no
if
yes
then
for
a
second
duel
more
deadly
than
the
first
notwithstanding
these
resolves
to
make
my
rival
declare
himself
i
doubted
not
the
damning
truth
i
endeavoured
to
resign
myself
to
its
torture
for
a
long
while
was
my
soul
upon
the
rack
more
than
an
hour
then
as
my
blood
grew
more
cool
reflections
of
a
calmer
nature
entered
my
mind
and
at
intervals
i
experienced
the
soothing
influence
of
hope
this
especially
when
i
recalled
the
words
of
spoken
on
the
preceding
night
surely
the
maniac
had
not
been
mocking
me
surely
it
was
not
a
dream
of
her
delirious
brain
a
distorted
of
memory
the
memory
of
some
scene
by
her
only
remembered
no
no
her
tale
was
not
distorted
her
thoughts
were
not
delirious
her
words
were
not
mockeries
how
sweet
it
was
to
think
so
yes
i
began
to
experience
intervals
of
placid
thought
more
than
placid
pleasant
alas
they
were
evanescent
the
memory
of
those
bold
meretricious
phrases
those
smiling
innuendoes
dissipated
or
darkened
them
as
cumuli
darken
the
sun
he
succeeded
she
was
now
his
favourite
most
certainly
words
worse
than
death
withal
it
was
a
foul
testimony
on
which
to
build
a
faith
i
longed
for
light
that
true
light
the
evidence
of
the
senses
that
leaves
nought
uncertain
i
should
seek
it
with
rash
directness
reckless
of
the
result
till
it
illumined
her
whole
history
proving
the
past
a
disgrace
the
future
a
chaos
of
utter
despair
i
longed
for
light
i
longed
for
the
coming
of
i
knew
not
what
the
maniac
wanted
something
i
supposed
concerning
the
captive
since
noon
i
had
little
thought
of
him
the
mad
queen
went
everywhere
knew
every
one
she
must
know
all
understand
all
ay
well
understand
she
too
had
been
betrayed
i
repaired
to
our
place
of
meeting
on
the
preceding
night
there
i
might
expect
her
i
crossed
the
little
ridge
among
the
stems
of
the
palmettoes
it
was
the
direct
route
to
the
shadowy
side
of
the
tank
i
descended
the
slope
and
stood
as
before
under
the
spreading
arms
of
the
was
before
me
a
single
moonbeam
slanting
athwart
the
leaves
shone
upon
her
majestic
figure
under
its
light
the
two
serpents
glittered
with
a
metallic
lustre
as
though
her
neck
and
waist
were
encircled
with
precious
gems
pretty
mico
you
are
come
gallant
mico
where
was
thine
eye
and
thine
arm
that
thou
didst
not
kill
the
literally
bad
man
villain
ah
the
hunter
of
the
deer
he
was
stricken
so
with
fear
when
he
stood
before
the
wolf
the
gaunt
wicked
wolf
when
he
saw
the
snarling
wolf
he
trembled
so
with
fear
that
unharmed
the
fierce
wolf
ran
away
ha
ha
ha
was
it
not
so
brave
mico
it
was
not
fear
that
hindered
me
ewa
besides
the
wolf
did
not
go
unscathed
ho
the
wolf
has
a
wounded
leg
he
will
lick
himself
well
again
he
will
soon
be
strong
as
ever
you
should
have
killed
him
fair
mico
ere
he
bring
the
pack
upon
you
i
could
not
help
my
ill
luck
i
am
unfortunate
every
way
no
you
shall
be
happy
young
mico
you
be
happy
friend
of
the
red
seminole
wait
till
you
see
see
what
patience
under
this
very
tree
you
will
see
what
is
fair
you
will
hear
what
is
sweet
and
perchance
will
be
revenged
this
last
phrase
was
spoken
with
an
earnest
emphasis
and
in
a
tone
that
shewed
a
strong
feeling
of
resentment
against
some
one
unknown
i
could
not
comprehend
the
nature
of
the
expected
vengeance
his
son
yes
continued
the
maniac
now
in
soliloquy
it
must
be
it
must
his
eyes
his
hair
his
form
his
gait
his
son
and
oh
will
have
revenge
was
i
myself
the
object
of
this
menace
such
a
thought
entered
my
mind
good
ewa
of
whom
are
you
speaking
roused
by
my
voice
she
looked
upon
me
with
a
bewildered
stare
and
then
broke
out
into
her
habitual
chant
why
did
i
trust
to
a
lover
ho
ho
ho
etc
suddenly
stopping
she
seemed
once
more
to
remember
herself
and
essayed
a
reply
to
my
question
whom
young
mico
of
him
the
fair
one
the
wicked
one
the
the
spirit
of
evil
see
he
comes
he
comes
behold
him
in
the
water
ho
ho
it
is
he
up
young
mico
up
into
thy
leafy
bower
stay
till
ewa
comes
hear
what
you
may
hear
see
what
you
may
see
but
for
your
life
stir
not
till
i
give
you
the
signal
up
up
up
just
as
on
the
preceding
night
half
lifting
me
into
the
the
maniac
glided
away
amidst
the
shadows
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
into
my
former
position
where
i
sat
silent
and
expecting
the
shadow
had
grown
shorter
but
there
was
still
enough
to
shew
me
that
it
was
the
form
of
a
man
in
another
moment
it
vanished
scarcely
an
instant
had
elapsed
ere
a
second
was
flung
upon
the
water
advancing
over
the
ridge
and
as
if
following
the
track
of
the
former
one
though
the
two
persons
did
not
appear
to
be
in
company
that
which
followed
i
could
trace
in
full
outline
it
was
the
figure
of
a
woman
one
whose
upright
bearing
and
free
port
proved
her
to
be
young
even
the
shadow
exhibited
a
certain
symmetry
of
form
and
gracefulness
of
motion
incompatible
with
age
was
it
still
had
she
gone
round
through
the
thicket
and
was
now
following
the
footsteps
of
the
man
for
a
moment
i
fancied
so
but
i
soon
perceived
that
my
fancy
was
astray
the
man
advanced
under
the
tree
the
same
moonbeam
that
but
a
moment
before
had
shone
upon
now
fell
upon
him
and
i
saw
him
with
sufficient
distinctness
he
was
the
he
stopped
took
out
his
watch
held
it
up
to
the
light
and
appeared
to
be
inquiring
the
hour
but
i
heeded
him
no
further
another
face
appeared
under
that
silvery
ray
false
and
shining
as
itself
it
was
the
face
that
to
me
seemed
the
loveliest
in
the
world
the
face
of
maumee
chapter
forty
four
an
eclaircissement
these
were
the
shadows
upon
the
water
promised
by
black
shadows
upon
my
heart
mad
queen
of
the
micosaucs
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
this
torture
thou
too
my
enemy
had
i
been
thy
deadliest
foe
thou
couldst
scarcely
have
contrived
a
keener
sting
for
thy
vengeance
face
to
face
stood
maumee
and
her
lover
seduced
and
seducer
i
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
either
the
moonbeam
fell
upon
both
no
longer
with
soft
silvery
light
but
gleaming
rude
and
red
like
the
chandeliers
of
a
bagnio
it
may
have
been
but
a
seeming
the
reflection
of
an
inflamed
imagination
that
influenced
me
from
within
but
my
belief
in
her
innocence
was
gone
hopelessly
gone
the
very
air
seemed
tainted
with
her
guilt
the
world
appeared
a
chaos
of
debauchery
and
ruin
i
had
no
other
thought
than
that
i
was
present
at
a
scene
of
assignation
how
could
i
think
otherwise
no
signs
of
surprise
were
exhibited
by
either
as
they
came
together
they
met
as
those
who
have
promised
to
come
who
have
often
met
before
evidently
each
expected
the
other
though
other
emotions
declared
themselves
there
was
not
the
slightest
sign
of
novelty
in
the
encounter
for
me
it
was
a
terrible
crisis
the
anguish
of
a
whole
life
compressed
into
the
space
of
a
single
moment
could
not
have
been
more
unendurable
the
blood
seemed
to
scald
my
heart
as
it
gushed
through
so
acute
was
the
pang
i
could
scarcely
restrain
myself
from
crying
aloud
an
effort
a
stern
determined
effort
and
the
throe
was
over
firmly
bracing
my
nerves
firmly
grasping
the
branches
i
clung
to
my
seat
resolved
to
know
more
that
was
a
fortunate
resolution
had
i
at
that
moment
given
way
to
the
wild
impulse
of
passion
and
sought
a
reckless
revenge
i
should
in
all
likelihood
have
carved
out
for
myself
a
long
lifetime
of
sorrow
patience
proved
my
guardian
angel
and
the
end
was
otherwise
not
a
word
not
a
motion
not
a
breath
what
will
they
say
what
do
my
situation
was
like
his
of
the
suspended
sword
on
second
thoughts
the
simile
is
both
trite
and
untrue
the
sword
had
already
fallen
it
could
wound
me
no
more
i
was
as
one
paralysed
both
in
body
and
soul
impervious
to
further
pain
not
a
word
not
a
motion
not
a
breath
what
will
they
say
what
do
the
light
is
full
upon
maumee
i
can
see
her
from
head
to
foot
how
large
she
has
grown
a
woman
in
all
her
outlines
perfect
entire
and
her
loveliness
has
kept
pace
with
her
growth
larger
she
is
lovelier
than
ever
demon
of
jealousy
art
thou
not
content
with
what
thou
hast
already
done
have
i
not
suffered
enough
why
hast
thou
presented
her
in
such
witching
guise
o
that
she
were
scarred
hideous
as
she
shall
yet
become
even
thus
to
see
her
would
be
some
satisfaction
an
anodyne
to
my
chafed
soul
but
it
is
not
so
her
face
is
sweetly
beautiful
never
so
beautiful
before
soft
and
innocent
as
ever
not
a
line
of
guilt
can
be
traced
on
those
placid
features
not
a
gleam
of
evil
in
that
round
rolling
eye
the
angels
of
heaven
are
beautiful
but
they
are
good
oh
who
could
believe
in
crime
concealed
under
such
loveliness
as
hers
i
expected
a
more
meretricious
mien
there
was
a
scintillation
of
cheer
in
the
disappointment
do
not
suppose
that
these
reflections
occupied
time
in
a
few
seconds
they
passed
through
my
mind
for
thought
is
quicker
than
the
magnetic
shock
they
passed
while
i
was
waiting
to
hear
the
first
words
that
to
my
surprise
were
for
some
moments
unspoken
to
my
surprise
could
not
have
met
her
in
such
fashion
my
heart
would
have
been
upon
my
tongue
and
lips
i
see
it
now
the
hot
burst
of
passion
is
past
the
springs
tide
of
love
has
subsided
such
an
interview
is
no
longer
a
novelty
perhaps
he
grows
tired
of
her
foul
libertine
that
he
is
see
they
meet
with
some
shyness
coldness
has
risen
between
them
a
love
quarrel
fool
is
he
as
villain
fool
not
to
rush
into
those
arms
and
at
once
reconcile
it
would
that
his
opportunities
were
mine
not
all
the
world
could
restrain
me
from
seeking
that
sweet
embrace
bitter
as
were
my
thoughts
they
were
less
bitter
on
observing
this
attitude
of
the
lovers
i
fancied
it
was
not
a
word
not
a
motion
not
a
breath
what
will
they
say
what
do
my
suspense
came
to
an
end
the
at
length
found
his
tongue
lovely
maumee
you
have
kept
your
promise
but
you
sir
have
not
yours
no
i
read
it
in
your
looks
you
have
yet
done
nothing
for
us
be
assured
maumee
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
the
general
has
been
so
busy
i
have
had
no
chance
to
press
the
matter
upon
him
but
do
not
be
impatient
i
shall
be
certain
to
persuade
him
and
your
property
shall
be
restored
to
you
in
due
time
tell
your
mother
not
to
feel
uneasy
for
sake
beautiful
maumee
i
shall
spare
no
exertion
believe
me
i
am
as
anxious
as
yourself
but
you
must
know
the
stern
disposition
of
my
uncle
and
moreover
that
he
is
on
the
friendly
terms
with
the
ringgold
family
in
this
will
lie
the
main
difficulty
but
i
fear
not
that
i
shall
be
able
to
surmount
it
o
sir
your
words
are
fine
but
they
have
little
worth
with
us
now
we
have
waited
long
upon
your
promise
to
befriend
us
we
only
wished
for
an
investigation
and
you
might
easily
have
obtained
it
ere
this
we
no
longer
care
for
our
lands
for
greater
wrongs
make
us
forget
the
less
i
should
not
have
been
here
had
we
not
been
in
sad
grief
at
the
misfortune
i
should
rather
say
outrage
that
has
fallen
upon
my
poor
brother
you
have
professed
friendship
to
our
family
i
come
to
seek
it
now
for
now
may
you
give
proof
of
it
obtain
my
freedom
and
we
shall
then
believe
in
the
fair
words
you
have
so
often
spoken
do
not
say
it
is
impossible
it
can
not
even
be
difficult
for
you
who
hold
so
much
authority
among
the
white
chiefs
my
brother
may
have
been
rude
but
he
has
committed
no
crime
that
should
entail
severe
punishment
a
word
to
the
great
and
he
would
be
set
free
go
then
and
speak
that
word
lovely
maumee
you
do
not
know
the
nature
of
the
errand
upon
which
you
send
me
your
brother
is
a
prisoner
by
orders
of
the
agent
and
by
the
act
of
the
it
is
not
with
us
as
among
your
people
i
am
only
a
subordinate
in
rank
and
were
i
to
offer
the
counsel
you
propose
i
should
be
rebuked
perhaps
punished
oh
you
fear
rebuke
for
doing
an
act
of
justice
to
say
naught
of
your
much
offered
friendship
good
sir
i
have
no
more
to
say
except
this
we
believe
you
no
longer
you
need
come
to
our
humble
dwelling
no
more
she
was
turning
away
with
a
scornful
smile
how
beautiful
seemed
that
scorn
stay
maumee
fair
maumee
do
not
part
from
me
thus
doubt
not
that
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
do
what
i
have
asked
you
set
my
brother
free
let
him
return
to
his
home
and
if
i
should
well
sir
know
maumee
that
for
me
to
do
so
would
be
to
risk
everything
i
might
be
degraded
from
my
rank
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
common
soldier
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
my
country
ay
punished
perhaps
by
imprisonment
worse
than
that
which
your
brother
is
likely
to
endure
all
this
would
i
risk
by
the
act
the
girl
paused
in
her
step
but
made
no
reply
and
yet
all
these
chances
shall
i
undergo
ay
the
danger
of
death
itself
if
you
fair
maumee
here
the
speaker
waxed
passionate
and
insinuating
if
you
will
only
consent
consent
to
what
sir
lovely
maumee
need
i
tell
you
surely
you
understand
my
meaning
you
can
not
be
blind
to
the
love
to
the
passion
to
the
deep
devotion
with
which
your
beauty
has
inspired
me
consent
to
what
sir
demanded
she
repeating
her
former
words
and
in
a
soft
tone
that
seemed
to
promise
compliance
only
to
love
me
fair
maumee
become
my
for
some
moments
there
was
no
reply
the
grand
woman
seemed
immobile
as
a
statue
she
did
not
even
start
on
hearing
the
foul
proposal
but
on
the
contrary
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
her
silence
had
an
encouraging
effect
upon
the
ardent
lover
he
appeared
to
take
it
for
assent
he
could
not
have
looked
into
her
eye
or
he
would
there
have
read
an
expression
that
would
have
hindered
him
from
pressing
his
suit
farther
no
he
could
not
have
observed
that
glance
or
he
would
hardly
have
made
such
a
mistake
only
promise
it
fair
maumee
your
brother
shall
be
free
before
the
morning
and
you
shall
have
everything
villain
villain
villain
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
in
all
my
life
i
never
heard
aught
so
delightful
as
that
laugh
it
was
the
sweetest
sound
that
ever
fell
upon
my
ears
not
all
the
that
ever
rang
not
all
the
lutes
that
ever
played
not
all
the
harps
and
hautboys
the
clarions
and
trumpets
in
the
world
could
have
produced
such
melodious
music
for
me
the
moon
seemed
to
pour
silver
from
the
sky
the
stars
had
grown
bigger
and
brighter
the
breeze
became
filled
with
delicious
odours
as
if
a
perfumed
censer
had
been
spilled
from
heaven
and
the
whole
scene
appeared
suddenly
transformed
into
an
elysium
chapter
forty
five
two
duels
in
one
day
the
crisis
might
have
been
my
cue
to
come
down
but
i
was
overpowered
with
a
sense
of
delightful
happiness
and
could
not
stir
from
my
seat
the
arrow
had
been
drawn
out
of
my
breast
leaving
not
a
taint
of
its
poison
the
blood
coursed
pleasantly
through
my
veins
my
pulse
throbbed
firm
and
free
my
soul
was
triumphant
i
could
have
cried
out
for
very
joy
with
an
effort
i
held
my
peace
and
waited
for
the
for
i
saw
that
the
scene
was
not
yet
at
an
end
mistress
indeed
exclaimed
the
bold
beauty
in
scornful
accent
and
this
is
the
motive
of
your
proffered
friendship
vile
wretch
for
what
do
you
mistake
me
a
or
a
facile
squaw
of
the
yamassee
know
sir
that
i
am
your
equal
in
blood
and
race
and
though
your
friends
have
robbed
me
of
my
inheritance
there
is
that
which
neither
they
nor
you
can
take
from
me
the
honour
of
my
name
mistress
indeed
silly
fellow
no
not
even
your
sooner
than
sell
myself
to
such
base
love
as
yours
i
should
wander
naked
through
the
wild
woods
and
live
upon
the
acorns
of
the
oak
rather
than
redeem
him
at
such
a
price
my
brave
brother
would
spend
his
lifetime
in
your
chains
oh
that
he
were
here
oh
that
he
were
witness
of
this
foul
insult
wretch
he
would
smite
thee
like
a
reed
to
the
earth
the
eye
the
attitude
the
foot
firmly
planted
the
fearless
determined
bearing
all
reminded
me
of
osceola
while
delivering
himself
before
the
council
maumee
was
undoubtedly
his
sister
the
lover
quailed
before
the
withering
reproach
and
for
some
time
stood
shrinking
and
abashed
he
had
more
than
one
cause
for
abasement
he
might
feel
regret
at
having
made
a
proposal
so
ill
received
but
far
more
at
the
disappointment
of
his
hopes
and
the
utter
discomfiture
of
his
designs
perhaps
the
moment
before
he
would
have
smothered
his
chagrin
and
permitted
the
girl
to
depart
without
molestation
but
the
scornful
apostrophe
had
roused
him
to
a
sort
of
frenzied
recklessness
and
probably
it
was
only
at
that
moment
that
he
formed
the
resolve
to
carry
his
rudeness
still
further
and
effect
his
purpose
by
force
i
could
not
think
that
he
had
held
such
design
anterior
to
his
coming
on
the
ground
professed
libertine
though
he
was
he
was
not
the
man
for
such
perilous
emprise
he
was
but
a
speck
of
vain
conceit
and
lacked
the
reckless
daring
of
the
ravisher
it
was
only
when
stung
by
the
reproaches
of
the
indian
maiden
that
he
resolved
upon
proceeding
to
extremes
she
had
turned
her
back
upon
him
and
was
moving
away
not
so
fast
cried
he
rushing
after
and
grasping
her
by
the
wrist
not
so
fast
my
charmer
do
you
think
you
can
cast
me
off
so
lightly
i
have
followed
you
for
months
and
by
the
god
of
phoebus
i
shall
make
you
pay
for
the
false
smiles
you
have
treated
me
to
you
need
struggle
we
are
alone
here
and
ere
we
part
i
shall
i
heard
no
more
of
this
hurried
speech
i
had
risen
from
my
perch
and
was
hurrying
down
to
the
rescue
but
before
i
could
reach
the
spot
another
was
before
me
her
eyes
glaring
fiercely
with
a
wild
maniac
laugh
upon
her
lips
was
rushing
forward
she
held
the
body
of
the
rattlesnake
in
her
extended
hands
its
head
projected
in
front
while
its
long
neck
was
oscillating
from
side
to
side
showing
that
the
reptile
was
angry
and
eager
to
make
an
attack
its
hiss
and
the
harsh
of
its
rattles
could
be
heard
sounding
at
intervals
as
it
was
carried
forward
in
another
instant
the
maniac
was
face
to
face
with
the
ravisher
who
startled
by
her
approach
had
released
his
hold
of
the
girl
and
falling
back
a
pace
stood
gazing
with
amazement
at
this
singular
intruder
screamed
the
maniac
as
she
glided
up
to
the
spot
his
son
his
son
i
am
sure
of
it
just
like
his
false
father
just
as
he
on
the
day
he
wronged
the
trusting
ewa
it
is
the
hour
the
very
hour
the
moon
in
the
same
quarter
horned
and
wicked
smiling
upon
the
guilt
the
hour
of
the
deed
the
hour
of
vengeance
the
father
crime
shall
be
atoned
by
the
son
great
spirit
give
me
revenge
give
me
revenge
as
she
uttered
these
apostrophic
appeals
she
sprang
forward
holding
the
snake
far
outstretched
as
if
to
give
it
the
opportunity
of
striking
the
now
terrified
man
the
latter
mechanically
drew
his
sword
and
then
as
if
inspired
by
the
necessity
of
defending
himself
cried
out
hellish
sorceress
if
you
come
a
step
nearer
i
shall
run
you
through
the
body
back
now
keep
off
or
by
i
shall
do
it
the
resolution
expressed
by
his
tone
proved
that
the
speaker
was
in
earnest
but
the
appeal
was
unheeded
the
maniac
continued
to
advance
despite
the
shining
blade
that
menaced
her
and
within
reach
of
whose
point
she
had
already
arrived
i
was
now
close
to
the
spot
i
had
drawn
my
own
blade
and
was
hurrying
forward
to
ward
off
the
fatal
blow
which
i
expected
every
moment
would
be
struck
it
was
my
design
to
save
who
seemed
recklessly
rushing
upon
her
destruction
in
all
probability
i
should
have
been
too
late
had
the
thrust
been
given
but
it
was
not
whether
from
terror
at
the
wild
unearthly
aspect
of
his
assailants
or
what
is
more
likely
fearing
that
she
was
about
to
fling
the
snake
upon
him
the
man
appeared
struck
with
a
sudden
panic
and
retreated
backward
a
step
or
two
brought
him
to
the
edge
of
the
water
there
were
loose
stones
strewed
thickly
along
the
shore
among
these
his
feet
became
entangled
and
balancing
backward
he
fell
with
a
plash
upon
the
pond
the
water
deepened
abruptly
and
he
sank
out
of
sight
perhaps
the
sudden
immersion
was
the
means
of
saving
his
life
but
the
moment
after
he
rose
above
the
surface
and
clambered
hastily
up
on
the
bank
he
was
now
furious
and
with
his
drawn
sword
which
he
had
managed
to
retain
hold
of
he
rushed
towards
the
spot
where
still
stood
his
angry
oaths
told
his
determination
to
slay
her
it
was
not
the
soft
yielding
body
of
a
woman
nor
yet
of
a
reptile
that
his
blade
was
to
encounter
it
struck
against
steel
hard
and
shining
as
his
own
i
had
thrown
myself
between
him
and
his
victims
and
had
succeeded
in
restraining
from
carrying
out
her
vengeful
design
as
the
assailant
approached
his
rage
but
more
the
water
him
hindered
him
from
seeing
me
and
it
was
not
till
our
blades
had
rasped
together
that
he
seemed
aware
of
my
presence
there
was
a
momentary
pause
accompanied
by
silence
you
randolph
at
length
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
surprise
ay
lieutenant
scott
randolph
it
is
pardon
my
intrusion
but
your
pretty
changing
so
suddenly
to
a
quarrel
i
deemed
it
my
duty
to
interfere
you
have
been
listening
you
have
heard
and
pray
sir
what
business
have
you
either
to
play
the
spy
on
my
actions
or
interfere
in
my
affairs
business
right
duty
the
duty
which
all
men
have
to
protect
weak
innocence
from
the
designs
of
such
a
terrible
blue
beard
as
you
appear
to
be
by
you
shall
rue
this
now
or
when
whenever
you
please
no
time
like
the
present
come
on
not
another
word
was
spoken
between
us
but
the
instant
after
our
blades
were
clinking
in
the
fierce
game
of
thrust
and
parry
the
affair
was
short
at
the
third
or
fourth
lunge
i
ran
my
antagonist
through
the
right
shoulder
disabling
his
arm
his
sword
fell
jingling
among
the
pebbles
you
have
wounded
me
cried
he
i
am
disarmed
he
added
pointing
to
the
fallen
blade
enough
sir
i
am
satisfied
but
not
i
not
till
you
have
knelt
upon
these
stones
and
asked
pardon
from
her
whom
you
have
so
grossly
insulted
never
cried
he
never
and
as
he
uttered
these
words
giving
as
i
presumed
a
proof
of
determined
courage
he
turned
suddenly
and
to
my
utter
astonishment
commenced
running
away
from
the
ground
i
ran
after
and
soon
overtook
him
i
could
have
thrust
him
in
the
back
had
i
been
sanguinarily
inclined
but
instead
i
contented
myself
with
giving
him
a
in
what
gallagher
would
have
termed
his
postayriors
and
with
no
other
adieu
left
him
to
continue
his
shameful
flight
chapter
forty
six
a
silent
declaration
now
for
the
love
the
sweet
young
love
under
the
tree
etc
it
was
the
voice
of
chanting
one
of
her
favourite
melodies
far
sweeter
the
tones
of
another
voice
pronouncing
my
own
name
george
randolph
maumee
you
both
remember
still
remember
the
island
that
fair
island
fair
to
you
but
dark
in
the
memory
of
i
think
no
more
no
no
no
now
for
the
love
the
sweet
young
love
under
it
was
once
mine
it
is
now
yours
mico
yours
pretty
creatures
enjoy
it
alone
you
wish
not
the
mad
queen
for
a
companion
ha
ha
i
go
fear
not
the
rustling
wind
fear
not
the
whispering
trees
none
can
approach
while
watches
she
will
be
your
guardian
too
ho
now
for
the
love
the
sweet
young
love
and
again
renewing
her
chant
the
strange
woman
glided
from
the
spot
leaving
me
alone
with
maumee
the
moment
was
not
without
embarrassment
to
me
perhaps
to
both
of
us
no
profession
had
ever
passed
between
us
no
assurance
not
a
word
of
love
although
i
loved
maumee
with
all
my
heart
strength
although
i
now
felt
certain
that
she
loved
me
there
had
been
no
mutual
declaration
of
our
passion
the
situation
was
a
peculiar
one
and
the
tongue
felt
restraint
but
words
would
have
been
superfluous
in
that
hour
there
was
an
electricity
passing
between
us
our
souls
were
our
hearts
in
happy
communion
and
each
understood
the
thoughts
of
the
other
not
all
the
words
in
the
world
could
have
given
me
surer
satisfaction
that
the
heart
of
maumee
was
mine
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
could
misconceive
with
but
slight
variation
my
thoughts
were
hers
in
all
likelihood
had
carried
to
her
ears
my
earnest
declaration
her
look
was
joyful
assured
she
did
not
doubt
me
i
extended
my
arms
opening
them
widely
nature
prompted
me
or
perhaps
passion
all
the
same
the
silent
signal
was
instantly
understood
and
the
moment
after
the
head
of
my
beloved
was
nestling
upon
my
bosom
not
a
word
was
spoken
a
low
fond
cry
alone
escaped
her
lips
as
she
fell
upon
my
breast
and
twined
her
arms
in
rapturous
compression
around
me
for
some
moments
we
exchanged
not
speech
our
hearts
alone
held
converse
soon
the
embarrassment
vanished
as
a
light
cloud
before
the
summer
sun
not
a
trace
of
shyness
remained
and
we
conversed
in
the
confidence
of
mutual
love
i
am
spared
the
writing
of
our
you
have
yourself
heard
or
uttered
them
if
too
to
be
repeated
so
also
are
they
too
sacred
i
forbear
to
detail
them
we
had
other
thoughts
to
occupy
us
after
a
while
the
transport
of
our
mutual
joys
though
still
sweet
assumed
a
more
sober
tinge
and
the
present
we
talked
of
the
past
and
the
future
i
questioned
maumee
much
without
guile
she
gave
me
the
history
of
that
long
interval
of
absence
she
confessed
or
rather
declared
for
there
was
no
coquettish
hesitation
in
her
manner
that
she
had
loved
me
from
the
first
even
from
that
hour
when
i
first
saw
and
loved
her
through
the
long
silent
years
by
night
as
by
day
had
the
one
thought
held
possession
of
her
bosom
in
her
simplicity
she
wondered
i
had
not
known
of
it
i
reminded
her
that
her
love
had
never
been
declared
it
was
true
she
said
but
she
had
never
dreamt
of
concealing
it
she
thought
i
might
have
perceived
it
her
instincts
were
keener
she
had
been
of
so
declared
she
with
a
freedom
that
put
me
off
my
guard
if
not
stronger
her
passion
was
nobler
than
my
own
she
had
never
doubted
me
during
the
years
of
separation
only
of
late
but
the
cause
of
this
doubt
was
explained
the
had
poured
poison
into
her
ears
hence
the
errand
of
alas
my
story
was
not
so
guileless
only
part
of
the
truth
could
i
reveal
and
my
conscience
smote
me
as
i
passed
over
many
an
episode
that
would
have
given
pain
but
the
past
was
past
and
could
not
be
a
more
righteous
future
was
opening
before
me
and
silently
in
my
heart
did
i
register
vows
of
atonement
never
more
should
i
have
cause
to
reproach
myself
never
would
my
love
never
could
it
wander
away
from
the
beautiful
being
i
held
in
my
embrace
proudly
my
bosom
swelled
as
i
listened
to
the
ingenuous
confession
of
her
love
but
sadly
when
other
themes
became
the
subject
of
our
converse
the
story
of
family
trials
of
wrongs
endured
of
insults
put
upon
them
and
more
especially
by
their
white
neighbours
the
ringgolds
caused
my
blood
to
boil
afresh
the
tale
corresponded
generally
with
what
i
had
already
learned
but
there
were
other
circumstances
unknown
to
public
rumour
he
too
the
wretched
hypocrite
had
love
to
he
had
of
late
desisted
from
his
importunities
through
fear
of
her
brother
and
dared
no
longer
come
near
the
other
scott
had
made
his
approaches
under
the
guise
of
friendship
he
had
learned
what
was
known
to
many
the
position
of
affairs
with
regard
to
the
indian
widow
plantation
from
his
relationship
in
high
quarters
he
possessed
influence
and
had
promised
to
exert
it
in
obtaining
restitution
it
was
a
mere
pretence
a
promise
made
without
any
intention
of
being
kept
but
backed
by
fair
words
it
had
deceived
the
generous
trusting
heart
of
osceola
hence
the
admission
of
this
heartless
cur
into
the
confidence
of
a
family
intimacy
for
months
had
the
correspondence
existed
though
the
opportunities
were
but
occasional
during
all
this
time
had
the
seducer
been
pressing
his
suit
though
not
very
boldly
since
he
too
dreaded
the
frown
of
that
terrible
brother
neither
successfully
he
had
succeeded
ringgold
well
knew
this
when
he
affirmed
the
contrary
his
declaration
had
but
one
design
to
sting
for
such
purpose
it
could
not
have
been
made
in
better
time
there
was
one
thing
i
longed
to
know
surely
maumee
with
her
keen
quick
perception
from
the
girlish
confidence
that
had
existed
between
them
surely
she
could
inform
me
i
longed
to
know
the
relations
that
had
existed
between
my
sister
and
her
brother
much
as
i
desired
the
information
i
refrained
from
asking
it
and
yet
we
talked
of
both
of
virginia
especially
for
maumee
remembered
my
sister
with
affection
and
made
many
inquiries
in
relation
to
her
virginia
was
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
had
heard
and
accomplished
beyond
all
others
she
wondered
if
my
sister
would
remember
those
walks
and
girlish
amusements
those
happy
hours
upon
the
island
perhaps
thought
i
it
was
a
theme
that
gave
me
pain
the
future
claimed
our
attention
the
past
was
now
bright
as
heaven
but
there
were
clouds
in
the
sky
of
the
future
we
talked
of
that
nearest
and
darkest
the
imprisonment
of
osceola
how
long
would
it
last
what
could
be
done
to
render
it
as
brief
as
possible
i
promised
to
do
everything
in
my
power
and
i
purposed
as
i
promised
it
was
my
firm
resolve
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
effect
the
liberation
of
the
captive
chief
if
right
should
not
prevail
i
was
determined
to
try
stratagem
even
with
the
sacrifice
of
my
commission
even
though
personal
disgrace
should
await
me
the
risk
of
life
itself
i
resolved
he
should
be
free
i
needed
not
to
add
to
my
declaration
the
emphasis
of
an
oath
i
was
believed
without
that
a
flood
of
gratitude
was
beaming
from
those
liquid
orbs
and
the
silent
pressure
of
lips
was
sweeter
thanks
than
words
could
have
uttered
it
was
time
for
parting
the
moon
told
the
hour
of
midnight
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
like
a
bronze
statue
outlined
against
the
pale
sky
stood
the
mad
queen
a
signal
brought
her
to
our
side
and
after
another
embrace
one
more
fervid
pressure
of
sweet
lips
maumee
and
i
parted
her
strange
but
faithful
guardian
led
her
away
by
some
secret
path
and
i
was
left
alone
i
could
scarcely
take
myself
away
from
that
consecrated
ground
and
i
remained
for
some
minutes
longer
giving
full
play
to
triumphant
and
rapturous
reflections
the
declining
moon
again
warned
me
and
crossing
the
crest
of
the
hill
i
hastened
back
to
the
fort
chapter
forty
seven
the
captive
late
as
was
the
hour
i
determined
to
visit
the
captive
before
going
to
rest
my
design
would
not
admit
of
delay
besides
i
had
a
suspicion
that
before
another
day
passed
my
own
liberty
might
be
curtailed
two
duels
in
one
day
two
antagonists
wounded
and
both
friends
to
the
myself
comparatively
friendless
it
was
hardly
probable
i
should
escape
scot
free
arrest
i
expected
as
certain
perhaps
a
trial
by
with
a
fair
chance
of
being
cashiered
the
service
despite
my
lukewarmness
in
the
cause
in
which
we
had
become
engaged
i
could
not
contemplate
this
result
without
uneasiness
little
did
i
care
for
my
commission
i
could
live
without
it
but
whether
right
or
wrong
few
men
are
indifferent
to
the
censure
of
their
fellows
and
no
man
likes
to
bear
the
brand
of
official
disgrace
reckless
as
one
may
be
of
self
kindred
and
family
have
a
concern
in
the
matter
not
to
be
lightly
ignored
gallagher
views
were
different
let
them
arrist
and
cashear
an
be
hanged
what
need
you
care
divil
a
bit
my
boy
sowl
man
if
i
were
in
your
boots
with
a
fine
plantation
and
a
whole
regiment
of
black
nagers
i
snap
my
fingers
at
the
sarvice
and
go
to
raisin
shugar
and
tobaccay
be
saint
pathrick
that
what
i
do
my
friend
consolatory
speech
failed
to
cheer
me
and
in
no
very
joyous
mood
i
walked
towards
the
quarters
of
the
captive
to
add
still
further
to
my
chances
of
cashierment
like
an
eagle
freshly
caught
and
caged
like
a
panther
in
a
pentrap
furious
restless
at
intervals
uttering
words
of
wild
menace
i
found
the
young
chief
of
the
the
apartment
was
quite
dark
there
was
no
window
to
admit
even
the
grey
lustre
of
the
night
and
the
corporal
who
guided
me
in
carried
neither
torch
nor
candle
he
went
back
to
the
to
procure
one
leaving
me
in
darkness
i
heard
the
footfall
of
a
man
it
was
the
sound
of
a
moccasined
foot
and
soft
as
the
tread
of
a
tiger
but
mingling
with
this
was
the
sharp
clanking
of
a
chain
i
heard
the
breathing
of
one
evidently
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
now
and
then
an
exclamation
of
fierce
anger
without
light
i
could
perceive
that
the
prisoner
was
pacing
the
apartment
in
rapid
irregular
strides
at
least
his
limbs
were
free
i
had
entered
silently
and
stood
near
the
door
i
had
already
ascertained
that
the
prisoner
was
alone
but
waited
for
the
light
before
addressing
him
preoccupied
as
he
appeared
to
be
i
fancied
that
he
was
not
conscious
of
my
presence
my
fancy
was
at
fault
i
heard
him
stop
suddenly
in
his
tracks
as
if
turning
towards
me
and
the
next
moment
his
voice
fell
upon
my
ear
to
my
surprise
it
pronounced
my
name
he
must
have
seen
through
the
darkness
you
randolph
he
said
in
a
tone
that
expressed
reproach
you
too
in
the
ranks
of
our
enemies
armed
uniformed
equipped
ready
to
aid
in
driving
us
from
our
homes
powell
not
powell
sir
my
name
is
osceola
to
me
still
edward
powell
the
friend
of
my
youth
the
preserver
of
my
life
by
that
name
alone
do
i
remember
you
there
was
a
momentary
pause
the
speech
had
evidently
produced
a
conciliating
effect
perhaps
memories
of
the
past
had
come
over
him
he
replied
your
errand
come
you
as
a
friend
or
only
like
others
to
torment
me
with
idle
words
i
have
had
visitors
already
gay
gibbering
fools
with
forked
tongues
who
would
counsel
me
to
dishonour
have
been
sent
upon
a
like
mission
from
this
speech
i
concluded
that
scott
the
had
already
been
with
the
captive
likely
on
some
errand
from
the
agent
i
come
of
my
own
accord
as
a
friend
george
randolph
i
believe
you
as
a
boy
you
possessed
a
soul
of
honour
the
straight
sapling
rarely
grows
to
a
crooked
tree
i
will
not
believe
that
you
are
changed
though
enemies
have
spoken
against
you
no
no
your
hand
randolph
your
hand
forgive
me
for
doubting
you
i
reached
through
the
darkness
to
accept
the
proffered
salute
instead
of
one
i
grasped
both
hands
of
the
prisoner
i
felt
that
they
were
manacled
together
for
all
that
the
pressure
was
firm
and
true
nor
did
i
return
it
with
less
warmth
enemies
had
spoken
against
me
i
needed
not
to
ask
who
these
were
that
had
been
already
told
me
but
i
felt
it
necessary
to
give
the
captive
assurance
of
my
friendship
i
needed
his
full
confidence
to
insure
the
success
of
the
plan
which
i
had
conceived
for
his
liberation
and
to
secure
this
i
detailed
to
him
what
had
transpired
by
the
pond
only
a
portion
of
what
had
passed
there
was
a
portion
of
it
i
could
not
intrust
even
to
the
ears
of
a
brother
i
anticipated
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
fury
but
was
agreeably
disappointed
the
young
chief
had
been
accustomed
to
harsh
developments
and
could
outwardly
control
himself
but
i
saw
that
my
tale
produced
an
impression
that
told
deeply
if
not
loudly
upon
him
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
see
his
face
but
the
grinding
teeth
and
hissing
ejaculations
were
expressive
of
the
strong
passions
stirring
within
fool
he
exclaimed
at
length
blind
fool
that
i
have
been
and
yet
i
suspected
this
villain
from
the
first
thanks
noble
randolph
i
can
never
repay
this
act
of
chivalric
friendship
henceforth
you
may
command
osceola
say
no
more
powell
you
have
nothing
to
repay
it
was
i
who
was
the
debtor
but
come
we
lose
time
my
purpose
in
coming
here
is
to
counsel
you
to
a
plan
for
procuring
your
release
from
this
awkward
confinement
we
must
be
brief
else
my
intentions
may
be
suspected
what
plan
randolph
you
must
sign
the
treaty
of
the
oclawaha
chapter
forty
eight
the
a
single
ugh
expressive
of
contemptuous
surprise
was
all
the
reply
and
then
a
deep
silence
succeeded
i
broke
the
silence
by
repeating
my
demand
you
must
sign
it
never
came
the
response
in
a
tone
of
emphatic
determination
never
sooner
than
do
that
i
will
linger
among
these
logs
till
decay
has
worn
the
flesh
from
my
bones
and
dried
up
the
blood
in
my
veins
sooner
than
turn
traitor
to
my
tribe
i
will
rush
against
the
bayonets
of
my
jailers
and
perish
upon
the
spot
never
patience
powell
patience
you
do
not
understand
me
you
in
common
with
other
chiefs
appear
to
misconceive
the
terms
of
this
treaty
remember
it
binds
you
to
a
mere
conditional
promise
to
surrender
your
lands
and
move
west
only
in
case
a
of
your
nation
agree
to
now
a
majority
has
agreed
nor
will
the
addition
of
your
name
make
the
number
a
majority
true
true
interrupted
the
chief
beginning
to
comprehend
my
meaning
well
then
you
may
sign
and
not
feel
bound
by
your
signature
since
the
most
essential
condition
still
remains
unfulfilled
and
why
should
you
not
adopt
this
ruse
as
you
certainly
have
been
no
one
could
pronounce
it
dishonourable
in
you
for
my
part
i
believe
you
would
be
justified
in
any
expedient
that
would
free
you
from
so
wrongful
an
imprisonment
perhaps
my
principles
were
scarcely
according
to
the
rules
of
moral
rectitude
but
at
that
moment
they
took
their
tone
from
strong
emotions
and
to
the
eyes
of
friendship
and
love
the
wrong
was
not
apparent
osceola
was
silent
i
observed
that
he
was
meditating
on
what
i
had
urged
why
randolph
said
he
after
a
pause
you
must
have
dwelt
in
philadelphia
that
famed
city
of
lawyers
i
never
took
this
view
before
you
are
right
signing
would
bind
me
it
is
true
but
think
you
that
the
agent
would
be
satisfied
with
my
signature
he
hates
me
i
know
it
and
his
reasons
i
hate
for
many
reasons
for
this
is
not
the
first
outrage
i
have
suffered
at
his
hands
will
he
be
satisfied
if
i
sign
i
am
almost
certain
of
it
simulate
submission
you
write
your
name
to
the
treaty
and
you
will
be
at
once
set
free
i
had
no
doubt
of
this
from
what
i
had
learned
since
osceola
arrest
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
thompson
repented
his
conduct
it
was
the
opinion
of
others
that
he
had
acted
rashly
and
that
his
act
was
likely
to
provoke
evil
consequences
whispers
of
this
nature
had
reached
him
and
from
what
the
captive
told
me
of
the
visit
of
the
i
could
perceive
that
it
was
nothing
else
than
a
mission
from
the
agent
himself
beyond
doubt
the
latter
was
tired
of
his
prisoner
and
would
release
him
on
the
easiest
terms
friend
i
shall
act
as
you
advise
i
shall
sign
you
may
inform
the
commissioner
of
my
intention
i
shall
do
so
at
the
earliest
hour
i
can
see
him
it
is
late
shall
i
say
good
night
ah
randolph
it
is
hard
to
part
with
a
friend
the
only
one
with
a
white
skin
now
left
me
i
could
have
wished
to
talk
over
other
days
but
alas
this
is
neither
the
place
nor
the
time
the
haughty
mien
of
the
proud
chief
was
thrown
aside
and
his
voice
had
assumed
the
melting
tenderness
of
early
years
yes
he
continued
the
only
white
friend
left
the
only
one
i
have
any
regard
for
one
other
whom
i
he
stopped
suddenly
and
with
an
embarrassed
air
as
if
he
had
found
himself
on
the
eve
of
disclosing
some
secret
which
on
reflection
he
deemed
it
imprudent
to
reveal
i
awaited
the
disclosure
with
some
uneasiness
but
it
came
not
when
he
spoke
again
his
tone
and
manner
were
completely
changed
the
whites
have
done
us
much
wrong
he
continued
once
more
rousing
himself
into
an
angry
attitude
wrongs
too
numerous
to
be
told
but
by
the
great
spirit
i
shall
seek
revenge
never
till
now
have
i
sworn
it
but
the
deeds
of
this
day
have
turned
my
blood
into
fire
ere
you
came
i
had
vowed
to
take
the
lives
of
two
who
have
been
our
especial
enemies
you
have
not
changed
my
resolution
only
strengthened
it
you
have
added
a
third
to
the
list
of
my
deadly
foes
and
once
more
i
swear
by
wykome
i
swear
that
i
shall
take
no
rest
till
the
blood
of
these
three
men
has
reddened
the
leaves
of
the
forest
three
white
villains
and
one
red
traitor
ay
omatla
triumph
in
your
treason
it
will
not
be
for
long
soon
shalt
thou
feel
the
vengeance
of
a
patriot
soon
shalt
thou
shrink
under
the
steel
of
osceola
i
made
no
reply
but
waited
in
silence
till
this
outburst
of
passion
had
passed
in
a
few
moments
the
young
chief
became
calm
and
again
addressed
me
in
the
language
of
friendship
one
word
said
he
before
we
part
circumstances
may
hinder
us
it
may
be
long
ere
we
meet
again
alas
our
next
meeting
may
be
as
foes
in
the
field
of
fight
for
i
will
not
attempt
to
conceal
from
you
that
i
have
no
intention
to
make
peace
no
never
i
wish
to
make
a
request
i
know
randolph
you
will
accede
to
it
without
asking
an
explanation
accept
this
token
and
if
you
esteem
the
friendship
of
the
giver
and
would
honour
him
wear
it
conspicuously
upon
your
breast
that
is
all
as
he
spoke
he
took
from
around
his
neck
a
chain
upon
which
was
suspended
the
image
of
the
rising
sun
already
alluded
to
he
passed
the
chain
over
my
head
until
the
glistening
symbol
hung
down
upon
my
breast
i
made
no
resistance
to
this
offering
of
friendship
but
promising
to
comply
with
his
request
presented
my
watch
in
return
and
after
another
cordial
pressure
of
hands
we
parted
as
i
had
anticipated
there
was
but
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
release
of
the
seminole
chief
though
the
commissioner
entertained
a
personal
hatred
against
osceola
for
causes
to
me
unknown
he
dared
not
indulge
his
private
spite
in
an
official
capacity
he
had
placed
himself
in
a
serious
dilemma
by
what
he
had
already
done
and
as
i
communicated
the
purposed
submission
of
the
prisoner
i
saw
that
thompson
was
but
too
eager
to
adopt
a
solution
of
his
difficulty
easy
as
unexpected
he
therefore
lost
no
time
in
seeking
an
interview
with
the
captive
chief
the
latter
played
his
part
with
admirable
tact
the
fierce
angry
attitude
of
yesterday
had
given
place
to
one
of
mild
resignation
a
night
in
the
hungered
and
manacled
had
tamed
down
his
proud
spirit
and
he
was
now
ready
to
accept
any
conditions
that
would
restore
him
to
liberty
so
fancied
the
commissioner
the
treaty
was
produced
osceola
signed
it
without
saying
a
word
his
chains
were
taken
off
his
thrown
open
and
he
was
permitted
to
depart
without
further
molestation
thompson
had
triumphed
or
fancied
so
it
was
but
fancy
had
he
noticed
as
i
did
the
fine
satirical
smile
that
played
upon
the
lips
of
osceola
as
he
stepped
forth
from
the
gate
he
would
scarcely
have
felt
confidence
in
his
triumph
he
was
not
allowed
to
exult
long
in
the
pleasant
hallucination
followed
by
the
eyes
of
all
the
young
chief
walked
off
with
a
proud
step
towards
the
woods
on
arriving
near
the
edge
of
the
timber
he
faced
round
to
the
fort
drew
the
shining
blade
from
his
belt
waved
it
above
his
head
and
in
defiant
tones
shouted
back
the
three
times
the
wild
signal
pealed
upon
our
ears
and
at
the
third
repetition
he
who
had
uttered
it
turned
again
sprang
forward
into
the
timber
and
was
instantly
lost
to
our
view
there
was
no
mistaking
the
intent
of
that
demonstration
even
the
commissioner
was
convinced
that
it
meant
war
to
the
knife
and
men
were
hurriedly
ordered
in
pursuit
an
armed
crowd
rushed
forth
from
the
gate
and
flung
themselves
on
the
path
that
had
been
taken
by
the
captive
the
chase
proved
bootless
and
fruitless
and
after
more
than
an
hour
spent
in
vein
search
the
soldiers
came
straggling
back
to
the
fort
gallagher
and
i
had
stayed
all
the
morning
in
my
quarters
expecting
the
order
that
would
confine
me
there
to
our
astonishment
it
came
not
there
was
no
arrest
in
time
we
obtained
the
explanation
of
my
two
duelling
antagonists
the
first
had
not
returned
to
the
fort
after
his
defeat
but
had
been
carried
to
the
house
of
a
friend
several
miles
distant
this
partially
covered
the
scandal
of
that
affair
the
other
appeared
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
but
it
was
the
impression
as
gallagher
learned
outside
that
his
horse
had
carried
him
against
a
tree
for
manifest
reasons
the
interesting
invalid
had
not
disclosed
the
true
cause
of
his
being
crippled
and
i
applauded
his
silence
except
to
my
friend
i
made
no
disclosure
of
what
had
occurred
and
it
was
long
before
the
affair
got
wind
upon
duty
the
and
i
often
met
afterwards
and
were
frequently
compelled
to
exchange
speech
but
it
was
always
of
an
official
character
and
i
need
not
add
was
spoken
in
the
severest
reserve
it
was
not
long
before
circumstances
arose
to
separate
us
and
i
was
glad
to
part
company
with
a
man
for
whom
i
felt
a
profound
contempt
chapter
forty
nine
war
to
the
knife
for
some
weeks
following
the
council
at
fort
king
there
appeared
to
be
tranquillity
over
the
land
the
hour
of
negotiation
had
passed
that
for
action
was
nigh
and
among
the
white
settlers
the
leading
topic
of
conversation
was
how
the
indians
would
act
would
they
fight
or
give
in
the
majority
believed
they
would
submit
some
time
was
granted
them
to
prepare
for
the
removal
runners
were
sent
to
all
the
tribes
appointing
a
day
for
them
to
bring
in
their
horses
and
cattle
to
the
fort
these
were
to
be
sold
by
auction
under
the
superintendence
of
the
agent
and
their
owners
were
to
receive
a
fair
value
for
them
on
their
arrival
at
their
new
home
in
the
west
their
plantations
or
improvements
were
to
be
disposed
of
in
a
similar
manner
the
day
of
auction
came
round
but
to
the
chagrin
of
the
commissioner
the
expected
flocks
did
not
make
their
appearance
and
the
sale
had
to
be
postponed
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
indians
to
bring
in
their
cattle
was
a
hint
of
what
might
be
expected
though
others
of
a
still
more
palpable
nature
were
soon
afforded
the
tranquillity
that
had
reigned
for
some
weeks
was
but
the
ominous
silence
that
precedes
the
storm
like
the
low
mutterings
of
the
distant
thunder
events
now
began
to
occur
the
sure
harbingers
of
an
approaching
conflict
as
usual
the
white
man
was
the
aggressor
three
indians
were
found
hunting
outside
the
boundary
of
the
reserve
they
were
made
captives
by
a
party
of
white
men
and
fast
bound
with
ropes
were
confined
in
a
belonging
to
one
of
the
party
in
this
situation
they
were
kept
three
days
and
nights
until
a
band
of
their
own
tribe
hearing
of
their
confinement
hastened
to
their
rescue
there
was
a
skirmish
in
which
some
indians
were
wounded
but
the
white
men
fled
and
the
captives
were
released
on
bringing
them
forth
to
the
light
their
friends
beheld
a
most
pitiable
sight
i
am
quoting
from
a
faithful
history
the
rope
with
which
these
poor
fellows
were
tied
had
worn
through
the
flesh
they
had
temporarily
lost
the
use
of
their
limbs
being
unable
to
stand
or
walk
they
had
bled
profusely
and
had
received
no
food
during
their
confinement
so
it
may
readily
be
imagined
that
they
presented
a
horrible
picture
of
suffering
again
six
indians
were
at
their
camp
near
kanapaha
pond
when
a
party
of
whites
came
upon
them
took
their
guns
from
them
examined
their
packs
and
commenced
whipping
them
while
in
the
act
two
other
indians
approached
and
seeing
what
was
going
on
fired
upon
the
whites
the
latter
returned
the
fire
killed
one
of
the
indians
and
severely
wounded
the
other
exasperation
was
natural
retaliation

between

and

brooke
was
met
within

miles
of

by
a
party
of
indians
who
seized
the
reins
of
his
horse
and
dragging
him
from
the
saddle
shot
him
dead
the
mangled
body
was
discovered
some
days
afterwards
concealed
in
the
woods
a
party
of
fourteen
mounted
men
proceeded
on

scout
towards

plantation

priest
and
when
within
one
mile
of
the
place
they
came
upon

hommock
through
which
some
of
the
party
declined
passing

of
them

into
it

indians
suddenly
arose
from
ambush

fired
upon
them

two
in
advance
were
wounded

a
vengeance
long
pent
up
a
return
for
wrongs
and
insults
patiently
endured
as
yet
no
general
engagement
had
taken
place
but
marauding
parties
sprang
up
simultaneously
in
different
places
many
of
those
who
had
inflicted
outrage
upon
the
indians
were
forthwith
repaid
and
many
barely
escaped
with
their
lives
conflagration
succeeded
conflagration
until
the
whole
country
was
on
fire
those
who
lived
in
the
interior
or
upon
the
borders
of
the
indian
reserve
were
compelled
to
abandon
their
crops
their
stock
their
implements
of
husbandly
their
furniture
and
indeed
every
article
of
value
and
seek
shelter
within
the
forts
or
concentrate
themselves
in
the
neighbouring
villages
around
which
stockades
were
erected
for
their
better
security
the
friendly
chiefs
the
omatlas
and
others
with
about
four
hundred
followers
abandoned
their
towns
and
fled
to
fort
brooke
for
protection
the
strife
was
no
longer
hypothetical
no
longer
doubtful
it
was
declared
in
the
wild
that
night
and
day
was
heard
ringing
in
the
woods
chapter
fifty
tracing
a
strange
horseman
as
yet
but
few
troops
had
reached
florida
though
detachments
were
on
the
way
from
new
orleans
fort
moultrie
savannah
mobile
and
other
depots
where
the
soldiers
of
the
united
states
are
usually
stationed
corps
of
volunteers
however
were
being
hastily
levied
in
the
larger
towns
of
georgia
carolina
and
florida
itself
and
every
settlement
was
mustering
its
quota
to
enter
upon
the
campaign
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
raise
a
force
in
the
settlements
of
the
suwanee
my
native
district
and
on
this
duty
my
friend
gallagher
was
dispatched
with
myself
to
act
as
his
lieutenant
right
gladly
did
i
receive
this
order
i
should
escape
from
the
monotonous
duties
of
the
fort
garrison
of
which
i
had
grown
weary
enough
but
what
was
a
still
more
pleasant
prospect
i
should
have
many
days
at
home
for
which
i
was
not
without
longing
gallagher
was
as
overjoyed
as
myself
he
was
a
keen
sportsman
though
having
spent
most
of
his
life
within
the
walls
of
cities
or
in
forts
along
the
atlantic
seaboard
he
had
found
only
rare
opportunities
of
enjoying
either
the
or
i
had
promised
him
both
to
his
heart
content
for
both
the
game
and
the
vermin
were
plenteous
in
the
woods
of
the
suwanee
not
unwillingly
therefore
did
we
accept
our
recruiting
commission
and
bidding
adieu
to
our
companions
at
the
fort
set
out
with
light
hearts
and
pleasant
anticipations
equally
joyous
was
black
jake
to
get
back
once
more
to
the
ole
plantayshun
in
the
quarter
of
the
suwanee
settlements
the
indian
marauders
had
not
yet
shown
themselves
it
lay
remote
from
the
towns
of
most
of
the
hostile
tribes
though
not
too
distant
for
a
determined
foray
in
a
sort
of
lethargic
security
the
inhabitants
still
remained
at
their
houses
though
a
volunteer
force
had
already
been
mustered
and
patrols
were
kept
in
constant
motion
i
had
frequent
letters
from
my
mother
and
virginia
neither
appeared
to
feel
any
alarm
my
sister
especially
declared
her
confidence
that
the
indians
would
not
molest
them
withal
i
was
not
without
apprehension
and
with
so
much
the
greater
alacrity
did
i
obey
the
order
to
proceed
to
the
settlements
well
mounted
we
soon
galloped
over
the
forest
road
and
approached
the
scenes
of
my
early
life
this
time
i
encountered
no
ambuscade
though
i
did
not
travel
without
caution
but
the
order
had
been
given
us
within
the
hour
and
having
almost
immediately
set
forth
my
could
have
had
no
warning
of
my
movements
with
the
brave
gallagher
by
my
side
and
my
stout
henchman
at
my
back
i
dreaded
no
open
attack
from
white
men
my
only
fear
was
that
we
might
fall
in
with
some
straggling
party
of
red
men
now
our
declared
enemies
in
this
there
was
a
real
danger
and
we
took
every
precaution
to
avoid
such
an
encounter
at
several
places
we
saw
traces
of
the
indians
nearly
fresh
there
were
moccasin
prints
in
the
mud
and
the
tracks
of
horses
that
had
been
mounted
at
one
place
we
observed
the
debris
of
a
fire
still
smouldering
and
around
it
were
signs
of
the
red
men
a
party
had
there
bivouacked
but
we
saw
no
man
red
or
white
until
we
had
passed
the
deserted
plantation
upon
the
creek
and
were
approaching
the
banks
of
the
river
then
for
the
first
time
during
our
journey
a
man
was
in
sight
he
was
a
horseman
and
at
a
glance
we
pronounced
him
an
indian
he
was
at
too
great
a
distance
for
us
to
note
either
his
complexion
or
features
but
the
style
of
dress
his
attitude
in
the
saddle
the
red
sash
and
leggings
and
above
all
the
waving
over
his
head
told
us
he
was
a
seminole
he
was
mounted
upon
a
large
black
horse
and
had
just
emerged
from
the
wood
into
the
opening
upon
which
we
had
ourselves
entered
he
appeared
to
see
us
at
the
same
time
we
caught
sight
of
him
and
was
evidently
desirous
of
avoiding
us
after
scanning
us
a
moment
he
wheeled
his
steed
and
dashed
back
into
the
timber
imprudently
enough
gallagher
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
after
i
should
have
counselled
a
contrary
course
but
that
the
belief
was
in
my
mind
that
the
horseman
was
osceola
in
that
case
there
could
be
no
danger
and
from
motives
of
friendship
i
was
desirous
of
coming
up
with
the
young
chief
and
exchanging
a
word
with
him
with
this
view
i
followed
my
friend
at
a
gallop
jake
coming
on
in
the
rear
i
was
almost
sure
the
strange
horseman
was
osceola
i
fancied
i
recognised
the
and
jake
had
told
me
that
the
young
chief
rode
a
fine
black
horse
in
all
likelihood
then
it
was
he
and
in
order
to
hail
and
bring
him
to
a
halt
i
spurred
ahead
of
gallagher
being
better
mounted
we
soon
entered
the
timber
where
the
horseman
had
disappeared
i
saw
the
fresh
tracks
but
nothing
more
i
shouted
aloud
calling
the
young
chief
by
name
and
pronouncing
my
own
but
there
was
no
reply
save
the
echo
of
my
voice
i
followed
the
trail
for
a
short
distance
continuing
to
repeat
my
cries
but
no
heed
was
given
to
them
the
horseman
did
not
wish
to
answer
my
hail
or
else
had
ridden
too
far
away
to
understand
its
intent
of
course
unless
he
made
a
voluntary
halt
it
was
vain
to
follow
we
might
ride
on
his
trail
for
a
week
without
coming
up
with
him
gallagher
saw
this
as
well
as
myself
and
abandoning
the
pursuit
we
turned
once
more
towards
the
road
with
the
prospect
of
soon
ending
our
journey
a
which
i
remembered
would
bring
us
by
a
shorter
route
to
the
landing
and
for
this
we
now
headed
we
had
not
ridden
far
when
we
again
struck
upon
the
tracks
of
a
horse
evidently
those
made
by
the
horseman
we
had
just
pursued
but
previously
to
our
having
seen
him
they
led
in
a
direct
line
from
the
river
towards
which
we
were
steering
some
slight
thought
prompted
me
to
an
examination
of
the
i
perceived
that
they
were
water
was
oozing
into
them
from
the
edges
there
was
a
slight
sprinkling
of
water
upon
the
dead
leaves
that
lay
along
the
trail
the
horseman
had
been
swimming
he
had
been
across
the
river
this
discovery
led
me
into
a
train
of
reflection
what
could
he
an
indian
want
on
the
other
side
if
osceola
as
i
still
believed
what
could
be
doing
there
in
the
excited
state
of
the
country
it
would
have
been
risking
his
life
for
an
indian
to
have
approached
the
settlement
and
to
have
been
discovered
and
captured
would
have
been
certain
death
this
indian
then
whoever
he
was
must
have
some
for
seeking
the
other
side
what
motive
if
osceola
what
motive
i
was
puzzled
and
reflected
i
could
think
of
no
motive
unless
that
the
young
chief
had
been
playing
the
spy
no
dishonourable
act
on
the
part
of
an
indian
the
supposition
was
not
improbable
but
the
contrary
and
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
it
true
a
cloud
had
swept
suddenly
over
my
soul
a
presentiment
scarcely
defined
or
definable
was
in
my
thoughts
a
demon
seemed
to
whisper
in
my
ears
is
not
certainly
had
the
horseman
been
across
the
river
let
us
see
we
rode
rapidly
along
the
trail
tracing
it
backwards
in
a
few
minutes
it
guided
us
to
the
bank
where
the
tracks
led
out
from
the
water
edge
no
corresponding
trail
entered
near
yes
he
had
been
across
i
plied
the
spur
and
plunging
in
swam
for
the
opposite
shore
my
companion
followed
without
asking
any
questions
once
more
out
of
the
river
i
rode
up
the
bank
i
soon
discovered
the
of
the
black
horse
where
he
had
sprung
off
into
the
stream
without
pausing
i
continued
to
trace
them
backwards
still
followed
by
gallagher
and
jake
the
former
wondered
at
my
eagerness
and
put
some
questions
which
i
scarcely
answered
coherently
my
presentiment
was
each
moment
growing
darker
my
heart
throbbed
in
my
bosom
with
a
strange
indescribable
pain
the
trail
brought
us
to
a
small
opening
in
the
heart
of
a
magnolia
grove
it
went
no
further
we
had
arrived
at
its
end
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
ground
with
a
sort
of
mechanical
gaze
i
sat
in
the
saddle
in
a
kind
of
stupor
the
dark
presentiment
was
gone
but
a
far
darker
thought
occupied
its
place
the
ground
was
covered
with
as
if
horses
had
been
halted
there
most
of
the
tracks
were
those
of
the
black
horse
but
there
were
others
of
not
half
their
dimensions
there
was
the
tiny
of
a
small
pony
golly
george
muttered
jake
coming
forward
in
advance
of
the
other
and
bending
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
lookee

hya
for
sartin
chapter
fifty
one
who
was
the
rider
i
felt
faint
enough
to
have
reeled
from
the
saddle
but
the
necessity
of
concealing
the
thoughts
that
were
passing
within
me
kept
me
firm
there
are
suspicions
that
even
a
bosom
friend
may
not
share
and
mine
were
of
this
character
if
suspicions
they
could
be
called
unhappily
they
approached
the
nature
of
convictions
i
saw
that
gallagher
was
mystified
not
as
i
supposed
by
the
tracks
upon
the
ground
but
by
my
behaviour
in
regard
to
them
he
had
observed
my
excited
manner
on
taking
up
the
trail
and
while
following
it
he
could
not
have
failed
to
do
so
and
now
on
reaching
the
glade
he
looked
upon
a
pallid
face
and
lips
quivering
with
emotions
to
him
unintelligible
what
is
it
geordie
my
boy
do
you
think
the
ridskin
has
been
after
some
dhirty
game
playing
the
spy
on
your
plantation
eh
the
question
aided
me
in
my
dilemma
it
suggested
a
reply
which
i
did
not
believe
to
be
the
truth
likely
enough
i
answered
without
displaying
any
embarrassment
an
indian
spy
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
and
evidently
in
communication
with
some
of
the
negroes
since
this
is
the
track
of
a
pony
that
belongs
to
the
plantation
some
of
them
have
ridden
thus
far
to
meet
him
though
for
what
purpose
it
is
difficult
to
guess
massa
george
spoke
out
my
black
follower
dar
no
one
ebber
ride
da
white
fox
jake
i
shouted
sharply
interrupting
him
gallop
forward
to
the
house
and
tell
them
we
are
coming
quick
my
man
my
command
was
too
positive
to
be
obeyed
with
hesitation
and
without
finishing
his
speech
the
black
put
spurs
to
his
cob
and
rode
rapidly
past
us
it
was
a
manoeuvre
of
mere
precaution
but
the
moment
before
i
had
no
thought
of
dispatching
an
to
announce
us
i
knew
what
the
simple
fellow
was
about
to
say
no
one
ebber
ride
da
white
fox
missa
vaginny
and
i
had
adopted
this
ruse
to
stifle
his
speech
i
glanced
towards
my
companion
after
jake
had
passed
out
of
sight
he
was
a
man
of
open
heart
and
free
of
tongue
with
not
one
particle
of
the
secretive
principle
in
his
nature
his
fine
florid
face
was
seldom
marked
by
a
line
of
suspicion
but
i
observed
that
it
now
wore
a
puzzled
expression
and
i
felt
uneasy
no
remark
however
was
made
by
either
of
us
and
turning
into
the
path
which
jake
had
taken
we
rode
forward
the
path
was
a
too
narrow
to
admit
of
our
riding
abreast
and
gallagher
permitting
me
to
act
as
pilot
drew
his
horse
into
the
rear
in
this
way
we
moved
silently
onward
i
had
no
need
to
direct
my
horse
it
was
an
old
road
to
him
he
knew
where
he
was
going
i
took
no
heed
of
him
but
left
him
to
stride
forward
at
his
will
i
scarcely
looked
at
the
path
once
or
twice
only
and
then
i
saw
the
tracks
of
the
pony
backward
and
forward
but
i
heeded
them
no
more
i
knew
whence
and
whither
they
led
i
was
too
much
occupied
with
thoughts
within
to
notice
aught
without
or
around
me
could
it
have
been
any
other
than
virginia
who
else
it
was
true
what
jake
had
intended
to
say
that
no
one
except
my
sister
ever
rode
white
fox
no
one
upon
the
plantation
being
permitted
to
mount
this
favourite
miniature
of
a
steed
yes
there
was
an
exception
i
had
seen
viola
upon
him
perhaps
jake
would
have
added
this
exception
had
i
allowed
him
to
finish
his
speech
might
it
have
been
viola
but
what
could
be
her
purpose
in
meeting
the
seminole
chief
for
that
the
person
who
rode
the
pony
had
held
an
interview
with
the
latter
there
could
not
be
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
tracks
told
that
clearly
enough
what
motive
could
have
moved
the
quadroon
to
such
a
meeting
surely
none
not
surely
either
how
could
say
so
i
had
been
long
absent
many
strange
events
had
transpired
in
my
absence
many
changes
how
could
i
tell
but
that
viola
had
grown
tired
of
her
sable
sweetheart
and
looked
kindly
upon
the
dashing
chieftain
no
doubt
there
had
been
many
opportunities
for
her
seeing
the
latter
for
after
my
departure
for
the
north
several
years
had
elapsed
before
the
expulsion
of
the
powells
from
their
plantation
and
now
that
i
thought
of
it
i
remembered
something
a
trifling
circumstance
that
had
occurred
on
that
very
day
when
young
powell
first
appeared
among
us
viola
had
expressed
admiration
of
the
handsome
youth
i
remembered
that
this
had
made
black
jake
very
angry
that
my
sister
too
had
been
angry
and
scolded
viola
as
i
thought
at
the
time
for
mortifying
her
faithful
lover
viola
was
a
beauty
and
like
most
beauties
a
coquette
my
conjecture
might
be
right
it
was
pleasant
to
think
so
but
alas
poor
jake
another
slight
circumstance
tended
to
confirm
this
view
i
had
observed
of
late
a
change
in
my
henchman
he
was
certainly
not
as
cheerful
as
of
yore
he
appeared
more
reflective
serious
dull
god
grant
that
this
might
be
the
explanation
there
was
another
conjecture
that
offered
me
a
hope
one
that
if
true
would
have
satisfied
me
still
better
for
i
had
a
strong
feeling
of
friendship
for
black
jake
the
other
hypothesis
was
simply
what
gallagher
had
already
suggested
although
white
fox
was
not
allowed
to
be
ridden
some
of
the
people
might
have
him
for
a
it
was
possible
and
not
without
probability
there
might
be
disaffected
slaves
on
our
plantation
there
were
on
almost
every
other
who
were
in
communication
with
hostile
indians
the
place
was
more
than
a
mile
from
the
house
riding
would
be
pleasanter
than
walking
and
taking
the
pony
from
its
pastures
might
be
easily
accomplished
without
fear
of
observation
a
great
black
negro
may
have
been
the
rider
after
all
god
grant
that
might
be
the
true
explanation
the
mental
prayer
had
scarcely
passed
my
thoughts
when
an
object
came
under
my
eyes
that
swept
my
theories
to
the
wind
sending
a
fresh
pang
through
my
heart
a
locust
tree
grew
by
the
side
of
the
path
with
its
branches
extending
partially
across
a
strip
of
ribbon
had
caught
on
one
of
the
spines
and
was
waving
in
the
breeze
it
was
silk
and
of
fine
texture
a
bit
of
the
trimming
of
a
lady
dress
torn
off
by
the
thorn
to
me
it
was
a
sad
token
my
fabric
of
hopeful
fancies
fell
into
ruin
at
the
sight
no
negro
not
even
viola
could
have
left
such
evidence
as
that
and
i
shuddered
as
i
spurred
past
the
fluttering
relic
i
was
in
hopes
my
companion
would
not
observe
it
but
he
did
it
was
too
conspicuous
to
be
passed
without
notice
as
i
glanced
back
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
him
reach
out
his
arm
snatch
the
fragment
from
the
branch
and
gaze
upon
it
with
a
puzzled
and
inquiring
look
fearing
he
might
ride
up
and
question
me
i
spurred
my
horse
into
a
rapid
gallop
at
the
same
time
calling
to
him
to
follow
ten
minutes
after
we
entered
the
lawn
and
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
house
my
mother
and
sister
had
come
out
into
the
verandah
to
receive
us
and
we
were
greeted
with
words
of
welcome
but
i
heard
or
heeded
them
not
my
gaze
was
riveted
on
virginia
upon
her
dress
it
was
a
the
plumed
chapeau
was
still
upon
her
head
my
beautiful
sister
never
seemed
she
more
beautiful
than
at
that
moment
her
cheeks
were
crimsoned
with
the
wind
her
golden
tresses
hanging
over
them
but
it
joyed
me
not
to
see
her
so
fair
in
my
eyes
she
appeared
a
fallen
angel
i
glanced
at
gallagher
as
i
tottered
out
of
my
saddle
i
saw
that
he
comprehended
all
nay
more
his
countenance
wore
an
expression
indicative
of
great
mental
suffering
apparently
as
acute
as
my
own
my
friend
he
was
tried
and
true
he
had
observed
my
anguish
he
now
guessed
the
cause
and
his
look
betokened
the
deep
sympathy
with
which
my
misfortune
inspired
him
chapter
fifty
two
cold
courtesy
i
received
my
mother
embrace
with
filial
warmth
my
sister
in
silence
almost
with
coldness
my
mother
noticed
this
and
wondered
gallagher
also
shewed
reserve
in
his
greeting
of
virginia
and
neither
did
this
pass
unobserved
of
the
four
my
sister
was
the
least
embarrassed
she
was
not
embarrassed
at
all
on
the
contrary
her
lips
moved
freely
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
a
cheerful
expression
as
if
really
joyed
by
our
arrival
you
have
been
on
horseback
sister
i
said
in
a
tone
that
affected
indifference
as
to
the
reply
say
rather
my
little
foxey
scarcely
deserves
the
proud
title
of
horse
yes
i
have
been
out
for
an
airing
alone
quite
alone
as
the
black
people
have
it
is
it
prudent
sister
why
not
i
often
do
it
what
have
i
to
fear
the
wolves
and
panthers
are
hunted
out
and
white
fox
is
too
swift
either
for
a
bear
or
an
alligator
there
are
creatures
to
be
encountered
in
the
woods
more
dangerous
than
wild
beasts
i
watched
her
countenance
as
i
made
the
remark
but
i
saw
not
the
slightest
change
what
creatures
george
she
asked
in
a
drawling
tone
imitating
that
in
which
i
had
spoken
redskins
indians
i
answered
abruptly
nonsense
brother
there
are
no
indians
in
this
neighbourhood
at
least
added
she
with
marked
hesitation
none
that
need
fear
did
i
not
write
to
tell
you
so
you
are
fresh
from
the
hostile
ground
where
i
suppose
there
is
an
indian
in
every
bush
but
remember
geordy
you
have
travelled
a
long
way
and
unless
you
have
brought
the
savages
with
you
you
will
find
none
here
so
gentlemen
you
may
go
to
sleep
without
fear
of
being
awakened
by
the
is
that
so
certain
miss
randolph
inquired
gallagher
now
joining
in
the
conversation
and
no
longer
broguing
it
your
brother
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
some
who
have
already
raised
the
are
not
so
far
off
from
the
settlements
of
the
suwanee
randolph
ha
ha
ha
why
gallagher
where
did
you
learn
that
respectful
appellative
it
is
so
distant
you
must
have
fetched
it
a
long
way
used
to
be
virginia
and
virgine
and
virginny
and
simple
for
which
last
i
could
have
spitted
you
gallagher
and
would
had
you
not
given
up
calling
me
so
what
the
matter
it
is
just
three
months
since
we
that
is
you
and
i
mister
gallagher
met
last
and
scarcely
two
since
geordy
and
i
parted
and
now
you
are
both
here
one
talking
as
solemnly
as
solon
the
other
as
soberly
as
socrates
george
i
presume
after
another
spell
of
absence
will
be
styling
me
randolph
i
suppose
that
the
fashion
at
the
fort
come
fellows
she
added
striking
the
balustrade
with
her
whip
your
minds
and
your
mouths
and
give
me
the
reason
of
this
wonderful
for
by
my
word
you
shall
not
eat
till
you
do
the
relation
in
which
gallagher
stood
to
my
sister
requires
a
little
explanation
he
was
not
new
either
to
her
or
my
mother
during
their
sojourn
in
the
north
he
had
met
them
both
but
the
former
often
as
my
almost
constant
companion
he
had
ample
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
virginia
and
he
had
in
reality
grown
well
acquainted
with
her
they
met
on
the
most
familiar
terms
even
to
using
the
diminutives
of
each
other
names
and
i
could
understand
why
my
sister
regarded
miss
randolph
as
a
rather
distant
mode
of
address
but
i
understood
also
why
he
had
thus
addressed
her
there
was
a
period
when
i
believed
my
friend
in
love
with
virginia
that
was
shortly
after
their
introduction
to
each
other
but
as
time
wore
on
i
ceased
to
have
this
belief
their
behaviour
was
not
that
of
lovers
at
least
according
to
my
notion
they
were
too
to
be
in
love
they
used
to
romp
together
and
read
comic
books
and
laugh
and
chatter
by
the
hour
about
trivial
things
and
call
each
other
and
the
like
in
fact
it
was
a
rare
thing
to
hear
them
either
talk
or
act
soberly
when
in
each
other
company
all
this
was
so
different
from
my
ideas
of
how
two
lovers
act
so
different
from
the
way
in
which
should
have
acted
that
i
gave
up
the
fancy
i
had
held
and
afterwards
regarded
them
as
two
beings
whose
characters
had
a
certain
correspondence
and
whose
hearts
were
in
unison
for
friendship
but
not
for
love
one
other
circumstance
confirmed
me
in
this
belief
i
observed
that
my
sister
during
gallagher
absence
had
little
relish
for
gaiety
which
had
been
rather
a
characteristic
of
her
girlish
days
but
the
moment
the
latter
would
make
his
appearance
a
sadden
change
would
come
over
her
and
she
would
enter
with
into
all
the
idle
bagatelle
of
the
hour
love
thought
i
does
not
so
exhibit
itself
if
there
was
one
in
whom
she
felt
a
it
was
not
he
who
was
present
no
gallagher
was
not
the
man
and
the
play
that
passed
between
them
was
but
the
fond
familiarity
of
two
persons
who
esteemed
each
other
without
a
spark
of
love
being
mixed
up
in
the
affection
the
dark
suspicion
that
now
rested
upon
his
mind
as
upon
my
own
had
evidently
saddened
him
not
from
any
feeling
of
jealousy
but
out
of
pure
friendly
sympathy
for
me
perhaps
too
for
her
his
bearing
towards
her
though
within
the
rules
of
the
most
perfect
politeness
changed
much
changed
no
wonder
she
took
notice
of
it
no
wonder
she
called
for
an
explanation
quick
cried
she
cutting
the
with
her
whip
is
it
a
travesty
or
are
you
in
earnest
unbosom
yourselves
both
or
i
keep
my
vow
you
shall
have
no
dinner
i
shall
myself
go
to
the
kitchen
and
countermand
it
despite
the
gloomy
thoughts
passing
within
her
manner
and
the
odd
menace
compelled
gallagher
to
break
into
laughter
though
his
laugh
was
far
short
of
the
hearty
cachinnation
she
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
from
him
i
was
myself
forced
to
smile
and
seeing
the
necessity
of
smothering
my
emotions
i
stammered
forth
what
might
pass
for
an
explanation
it
was
not
the
time
for
the
true
one
verily
sister
said
i
we
are
too
tired
for
mirth
and
too
hungry
as
well
consider
how
far
we
have
ridden
and
under
a
broiling
sun
neither
of
us
has
tasted
a
morsel
since
leaving
the
fort
and
our
breakfast
there
was
none
of
the
most
sumptuous
corncakes
and
weak
coffee
with
pickled
pork
how
i
long
for
some
of
aunt
sheba
virginia
biscuits
and
fixings
pray
let
us
have
our
dinner
and
then
you
shall
see
a
change
in
us
we
shall
both
be
as
merry
as
after
it
satisfied
with
this
explanation
or
affecting
to
be
so
for
her
response
was
a
promise
to
let
us
have
our
dinner
accompanied
by
a
cheerful
laugh
my
sister
retired
to
make
the
necessary
change
in
her
costume
while
my
friend
and
i
were
shown
to
our
separate
apartments
at
dinner
and
afterwards
i
did
my
utmost
to
counterfeit
ease
to
appear
happy
and
cheerful
i
noticed
that
gallagher
was
enacting
a
similar
perhaps
this
seeming
may
have
deceived
my
mother
but
not
virginia
ere
many
hours
had
passed
i
observed
signs
of
suspicion
directed
equally
against
gallagher
as
myself
she
suspected
that
all
was
not
right
and
began
to
show
pique
almost
spitefulness
in
her
conversation
with
us
both
chapter
fifty
three
my
sister
spirit
for
the
remainder
of
that
day
and
throughout
the
next
this
unsatisfactory
state
of
things
continued
during
which
time
the
three
of
us
my
friend
my
sister
and
myself
acted
under
a
polite
reserve
it
was
triangular
for
i
had
not
made
gallagher
my
confidant
but
left
him
entirely
to
his
conjectures
he
was
a
true
gentleman
and
never
even
hinted
at
what
he
must
have
was
engrossing
the
whole
of
my
thoughts
it
was
my
intention
to
unbosom
myself
to
him
and
seek
his
friendly
advice
but
not
until
a
little
time
had
elapsed
not
till
i
had
obtained
a
full
from
virginia
i
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
effect
this
not
but
that
many
a
one
offered
many
a
time
might
i
have
found
her
alone
but
on
each
occasion
my
resolution
forsook
me
i
actually
dreaded
to
bring
her
to
a
confession
and
yet
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
as
her
brother
the
nearest
male
relative
it
was
mine
to
guard
her
honour
to
preserve
the
family
escutcheon
pure
and
untarnished
for
days
was
i
restrained
from
this
fraternal
duty
partly
through
a
natural
feeling
of
delicacy
partly
from
a
fear
of
the
disclosure
i
might
draw
forth
i
dreaded
to
know
the
truth
that
a
correspondence
had
passed
between
my
sister
and
the
indian
chief
that
it
was
in
all
probability
still
going
on
that
a
clandestine
meeting
had
taken
place
more
than
one
mayhap
all
this
i
knew
well
enough
but
to
what
length
had
these
proceedings
been
carried
how
far
had
my
poor
sister
compromised
herself
these
were
the
interrogatories
to
which
i
dreaded
the
answer
i
believed
she
would
tell
me
the
truth
that
is
if
entreated
if
commanded
of
the
last
i
felt
satisfied
i
knew
her
proud
spirit
prouder
of
late
when
roused
to
hostility
she
could
be
capable
of
the
most
obstinate
resistance
firm
and
unyielding
there
was
much
of
my
mother
nature
in
her
and
little
of
my
father
personally
as
already
stated
she
resembled
her
mother
intellectually
there
was
also
a
similitude
she
was
one
of
those
women
for
she
now
deserved
the
title
who
have
never
known
the
restraint
of
a
severe
discipline
and
who
grow
up
in
the
belief
that
they
have
no
superior
no
master
upon
earth
hence
the
full
development
of
a
feeling
of
perfect
independence
which
among
american
women
is
common
enough
but
in
other
lands
can
only
exist
among
those
of
the
privileged
classes
uncontrolled
by
parent
guardian
or
teacher
for
this
last
had
not
been
allowed
to
rule
by
the
rod
my
sister
had
grown
to
the
age
of
womanhood
and
she
felt
herself
as
masterless
as
a
queen
upon
her
throne
she
was
independent
in
another
sense
one
which
exerts
a
large
influence
over
the
freedom
of
the
spirit
her
fortune
was
her
own
in
the
states
of
america
the
law
of
entail
is
not
allowed
it
is
even
provided
against
by
statute
those
statesmen
presidents
who
in
long
line
succeeded
the
father
of
the
republic
were
wise
legislators
they
saw
lurking
under
this
wicked
law
which
at
most
appears
only
to
affect
the
family
relations
the
strong
arm
of
the
political
tyrant
and
therefore
took
measures
to
guard
against
its
introduction
to
the
land
wisely
did
they
act
as
time
will
show
or
indeed
has
shown
already
for
had
the
congress
of
washington
day
but
sanctioned
the
law
of
entail
the
great
american
republic
would
long
since
have
passed
into
an
oligarchy
untrammelled
by
any
such
unnatural
statute
my
father
had
acted
as
all
men
of
proper
feeling
are
likely
to
do
he
had
followed
the
dictates
of
the
heart
and
divided
his
property
in
equal
shares
between
his
children
so
far
as
independence
of
fortune
went
my
sister
was
my
equal
of
course
our
mother
had
not
been
left
unprovided
for
but
the
bulk
of
the
patrimonial
estate
now
belonged
to
virginia
and
myself
my
sister
then
was
an
heiress
quite
independent
of
either
mother
or
brother
bound
by
no
authority
to
either
except
that
which
exists
in
the
ties
of
the
heart
in
filial
and
sororal
affection
i
have
been
minute
with
these
circumstances
in
order
to
explain
the
delicate
duty
i
had
to
perform
in
calling
my
sister
to
an
account
strange
that
i
reflected
not
on
my
own
anomalous
position
at
that
hour
it
never
entered
my
thoughts
here
was
i
affianced
to
the
sister
of
this
very
man
with
the
sincere
intention
of
making
her
my
wife
i
could
perceive
nothing
unnatural
nothing
disgraceful
in
the
alliance
neither
would
society
such
in
earlier
times
had
done
honour
to
rolfe
who
had
mated
with
a
maiden
of
darker
skin
less
beauty
and
far
slighter
accomplishments
than
maumee
in
later
days
hundreds
of
others
had
followed
his
example
without
the
loss
either
of
or
character
and
why
should
not
i
in
truth
the
question
had
never
occurred
to
me
for
it
never
entered
my
thoughts
that
my
purpose
in
regard
to
indian
was
otherwise
than
perfectly
it
would
have
been
different
had
there
been
a
taint
of
in
the
veins
of
my
intended
then
indeed
might
i
have
dreaded
the
frowns
of
society
for
in
america
it
is
not
the
colour
of
the
skin
that
condemns
but
the
blood
the
blood
the
white
gentleman
may
marry
an
indian
wife
she
may
enter
society
without
protest
if
beautiful
become
a
belle
all
this
i
knew
while
at
the
same
time
i
was
slave
to
a
belief
in
the
monstrous
anomaly
that
where
the
blood
is
mingled
from
the
other
side
where
the
woman
is
white
and
the
man
red
the
union
becomes
a
a
disgrace
by
the
friends
of
the
former
such
a
union
is
regarded
as
a
misfortune
a
fall
and
when
the
woman
chances
to
be
a
ah
then
indeed
little
regard
as
i
had
for
many
of
my
country
prejudices
regarding
race
and
colour
i
was
not
free
from
the
influence
of
this
social
maxim
to
believe
my
sister
in
love
with
an
indian
would
be
to
regard
her
as
lost
fallen
no
matter
how
high
in
rank
among
his
own
people
no
matter
how
brave
how
accomplished
he
might
be
no
matter
if
it

preying
upon
me
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
i
at
length
resolved
upon
demanding
an
explanation
from
my
sister
as
soon
as
i
should
find
her
alone
the
opportunity
soon
offered
i
chanced
to
see
her
in
the
lawn
down
near
the
edge
of
the
lake
i
saw
that
she
was
in
a
mood
unusually
cheerful
alas
thought
i
as
i
approached
full
of
my
resolutions
these
smiles
i
shall
soon
change
them
to
tears
sister
she
was
talking
to
her
pets
and
did
not
hear
me
or
pretended
she
did
not
sister
i
repeated
in
a
louder
voice
well
what
is
it
she
inquired
drily
without
looking
up
pray
virginia
leave
off
your
play
and
talk
to
me
certainly
that
is
an
inducement
i
have
had
so
little
of
your
tongue
of
late
that
i
ought
to
feel
gratified
by
your
proposal
why
do
you
bring
your
friend
and
let
him
try
a
little
in
that
line
too
you
have
been
playing
double
dummy
long
enough
to
get
tired
of
it
i
should
think
but
go
on
with
the
game
if
it
please
you
it
do
trouble
me
i
assure
you
a
yankee
ship
and
a
yankee
crew
tally
high
ho
you
know
wo
strike
to
the
foe
while
the
sky
it
is
blue
and
a
tar
aloft
or
alow
come
now
little
fan
fan
do
go
too
near
the
bank
or
you
may
get
a
ducking
do
you
hear
pray
sister
virginia
give
over
this
badinage
i
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
you
importance
what
are
you
going
to
get
married
no
that
ca
be
it
your
face
is
too
portentous
and
lugubrious
you
look
more
like
one
on
the
road
to
be
hanged
ha
ha
ha
i
tell
you
sister
i
am
in
earnest
who
said
you
was
in
earnest
i
believe
you
my
boy
listen
to
me
virginia
i
have
something
important
very
important
to
talk
about
i
have
been
desirous
of
breaking
the
subject
to
you
ever
since
my
return
well
why
did
you
not
you
have
had
opportunities
enough
have
i
been
hid
from
you
no
but
the
fact
is
go
on
brother
you
have
an
opportunity
now
if
it
be
a
petition
as
your
looks
appear
to
say
present
it
i
am
ready
to
receive
it
nay
virginia
it
is
not
that
the
subject
upon
which
i
wish
to
speak
what
subject
man
out
with
it
i
was
weary
with
so
much
circumlocution
and
a
little
piqued
as
well
i
resolved
to
bring
it
to
an
end
a
word
thought
i
will
tame
down
her
tone
and
render
her
as
serious
as
myself
i
answered
osceola
i
looked
to
see
her
start
to
see
her
cheek
turn
alternately
red
and
pale
but
to
my
astonishment
no
such
symptoms
displayed
themselves
not
the
slightest
indication
of
any
extraordinary
emotion
betrayed
itself
either
in
her
look
or
manner
she
replied
almost
directly
and
without
hesitation
what
the
young
chief
of
the
seminoles
our
old
playfellow
powell
he
is
to
be
the
subject
of
our
discourse
you
could
not
have
chosen
one
more
interesting
to
i
could
talk
all
day
long
about
this
brave
fellow
i
was
struck
dumb
by
her
reply
and
scarcely
knew
in
what
way
to
proceed
but
what
of
him
brother
george
continued
my
sister
looking
me
more
soberly
in
the
face
i
hope
no
harm
has
befallen
him
none
that
i
know
of
the
harm
has
fallen
upon
those
nearer
and
dearer
i
do
not
understand
you
my
mysterious
brother
but
you
shall
i
am
about
to
put
a
question
to
you
answer
me
and
answer
me
truly
as
you
value
my
love
and
friendship
your
question
sir
without
these
insinuations
i
can
speak
the
truth
i
fancy
without
being
scared
by
threats
then
speak
it
virginia
tell
me
is
powell
is
osceola
your
lover
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
nay
virginia
this
is
no
laughing
matter
by
my
faith
i
think
it
is
a
very
capital
joke
ha
ha
ha
i
want
no
trifling
virginia
an
answer
you
shall
get
no
answer
to
such
an
absurd
question
it
is
not
absurd
i
have
good
reasons
for
putting
it
reasons
state
them
pray
you
can
not
deny
that
something
has
passed
between
you
you
can
not
deny
that
you
have
given
him
a
meeting
and
in
the
forest
too
beware
how
you
make
answer
for
i
have
the
proofs
we
encountered
the
chief
on
his
return
we
saw
him
at
a
distance
he
shunned
us
no
wonder
we
followed
his
trail
we
saw
the
tracks
of
the
pony
oh
you
met
it
was
all
clear
enough
ha
ha
ha
what
a
pair
of
keen
trackers
you
and
your
friend
astute
fellows
you
will
be
invaluable
on
the
warpath
you
will
be
promoted
to
be
chief
spies
to
the
army
ha
ha
ha
and
so
this
is
the
grand
secret
is
it
this
accounts
for
the
demure
looks
and
the
airs
that
have
been
puzzling
me
my
honour
eh
that
was
the
care
that
was
cankering
you
by
diana
i
have
reason
to
be
thankful
for
being
blessed
with
such
a
chivalric
brace
of
guardians
in
england
the
garden
of
beauty
is
kept
by
the
dragon
of
prudery
placed
within
call
but
so
oft
this
unamiable
dragon
has
slept
that
the
garden
was
carelessly
watched
after
all
and
so
if
i
have
not
the
dragon
prudery
to
guard
me
i
am
to
find
a
brace
of
dragons
in
my
brother
and
his
friend
ha
ha
ha
virginia
you
madden
me
this
is
no
answer
did
you
meet
osceola
i
answer
that
directly
after
such
sharp
espionage
denial
would
not
avail
me
i
meet
him
and
for
what
purpose
did
you
meet
as
lovers
that
question
is
impertinent
i
wo
answer
virginia
i
implore
you
and
can
not
two
people
encounter
each
other
in
the
woods
without
being
charged
with
might
we
not
have
come
together
by
chance
or
might
i
not
have
had
other
business
with
the
seminole
chief
you
do
not
know
all
my
secrets
nor
do
i
intend
you
shall
either
oh
it
was
no
chance
encounter
it
was
an
appointment
a
you
could
have
had
no
other
affair
with
it
is
natural
for
you
to
think
so
very
natural
since
i
hear
you
practise
such
yourself
how
long
may
i
ask
since
you
held
your
last
with
your
own
fair
charmer
the
lovely
maumee
eh
brother
i
started
as
if
stung
how
could
my
sister
have
gained
intelligence
of
this
was
she
only
guessing
and
had
chanced
upon
the
truth
for
some
moments
i
could
not
make
reply
nor
did
i
make
any
to
her
last
interrogatory
i
paid
no
heed
to
it
but
becoming
excited
pressed
my
former
inquiries
with
vehemence
sister
i
must
have
an
explanation
i
insist
upon
it
i
demand
it
demand
ho
that
is
your
tone
is
it
that
will
scarcely
serve
you
a
moment
ago
when
you
put
yourself
in
the
imploring
attitude
i
had
taken
pity
on
you
and
told
you
all
but
indeed
i
answer
no
demands
and
to
show
you
that
i
do
not
i
shall
now
go
and
shut
myself
in
my
room
so
my
good
fellow
you
shall
see
no
more
of
me
for
this
day
nor
either
unless
you
come
to
your
senses
geordy
and
only
on
condition
you
behave
yourself
like
a
gentleman
a
yankee
ship
and
a
yankee
crew
tally
high
ho
you
know
wo
strike
to
the
foe
etc
etc
and
with
this
catch
pealing
from
her
lips
she
passed
across
the
parterre
entered
the
verandah
and
disappeared
within
the
doorway
disappointed
mortified
sad
i
stood
riveted
to
the
spot
scarcely
knowing
in
what
direction
to
turn
myself
chapter
fifty
five
the
volunteers
my
sister
kept
her
word
i
saw
no
more
of
her
for
that
day
nor
until
noon
of
the
next
then
she
came
forth
from
her
chamber
in
full
riding
costume
ordered
white
fox
to
be
saddled
and
mounting
rode
off
alone
i
felt
that
i
had
no
power
over
this
capricious
spirit
it
was
idle
to
attempt
controlling
it
she
was
beyond
the
dictation
of
fraternal
authority
her
own
mistress
and
evidently
determined
upon
having
her
will
and
her
way
after
the
conversation
of
yesterday
i
felt
no
inclination
to
interfere
again
she
was
acquainted
with
my
secret
and
knowing
this
any
counsel
from
me
would
come
with
an
ill
grace
and
be
as
ill
received
i
resolved
therefore
to
withhold
it
till
some
crisis
should
arrive
that
would
render
it
more
impressive
for
several
days
this
coolness
continued
between
us
at
which
my
mother
often
wondered
but
of
which
she
received
no
explanation
indeed
i
fancied
that
even
affection
towards
me
was
not
so
tender
as
it
used
to
be
perhaps
i
was
wronging
her
she
was
a
little
angry
with
me
about
the
duel
with
ringgold
the
first
intelligence
of
which
had
gravely
affected
her
on
my
return
i
had
received
her
reproaches
for
it
was
believed
that
i
alone
was
to
blame
in
bringing
the
affair
about
why
had
i
acted
so
rudely
towards
arens
ringgold
and
all
about
nothing
a
trumpery
indian
belle
what
mattered
it
to
me
what
may
have
been
said
about
the
girl
likely
what
was
said
was
nothing
more
than
the
truth
i
should
have
behaved
with
more
prudence
i
perceived
that
my
mother
had
been
informed
upon
most
of
the
material
points
connected
with
the
affair
of
one
however
she
was
ignorant
she
knew
not
who
the
trumpery
indian
belle
was
she
had
not
heard
the
name
of
maumee
knowing
her
to
be
ignorant
of
this
i
listened
with
more
calmness
to
the
aspersive
remarks
for
all
that
i
was
somewhat
excited
by
her
reproaches
and
several
times
upon
the
point
of
declaring
to
her
the
true
cause
why
i
had
called
ringgold
to
an
account
for
certain
reasons
i
forbore
my
mother
would
not
have
believed
me
as
for
ringgold
himself
i
ascertained
that
a
great
change
in
his
fortunes
had
lately
taken
place
his
father
was
dead
had
died
in
a
fit
of
passion
whilst
in
the
act
of
chastising
one
of
his
slaves
a
had
burst
and
he
had
fallen
as
if
by
a
judgment
of
god
arens
the
only
son
was
now
master
of
his
vast
wealth
a
plantation
with
some
three
hundred
slaves
upon
it
and
it
was
said
that
this
had
only
made
him
more
avaricious
than
ever
his
aim
was
as
it
had
been
that
of
the
older
ringgold
to
become
owner
of
everybody
and
everything
around
him
a
grand
the
son
was
a
fit
successor
to
the
father
he
had
played
the
invalid
for
a
while
carrying
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
as
people
said
not
a
little
vain
of
having
been
engaged
in
a
duel
those
who
understood
how
that
affair
had
terminated
thought
he
had
little
reason
to
be
proud
of
it
it
seemed
the
hostility
between
him
and
myself
had
brought
about
no
change
in
his
relations
with
our
family
i
learned
that
he
had
been
a
constant
visitor
at
the
house
and
the
world
still
believed
him
the
accepted
suitor
of
virginia
moreover
since
his
late
accession
to
wealth
and
power
he
had
grown
more
than
ever
a
favourite
with
my
ambitious
mother
i
learned
all
this
with
regret
the
old
home
appeared
to
have
undergone
a
change
there
was
not
the
same
warmth
of
affection
as
of
yore
i
missed
my
kind
noble
father
my
mother
at
times
appeared
cold
and
distant
as
if
she
believed
me
undutiful
my
uncle
was
her
brother
and
like
her
in
everything
even
my
fond
sister
seemed
for
the
moment
estranged
i
began
to
feel
as
a
stranger
in
my
own
house
and
feeling
so
stayed
but
little
at
home
most
of
the
day
was
i
abroad
with
gallagher
as
my
companion
of
course
my
friend
remained
our
guest
during
our
stay
on
the
suwanee
our
time
was
occupied
partly
with
the
duties
upon
which
we
had
been
commanded
and
partly
in
following
the
amusement
of
the
chase
of
and
fox
running
we
had
an
abundance
but
i
did
not
enjoy
it
as
formerly
neither
did
my
companion
ardent
sportsman
though
he
was
seem
to
take
the
delight
in
it
which
he
had
anticipated
our
military
duties
were
by
no
means
of
an
arduous
nature
and
were
usually
over
before
noon
our
orders
had
been
not
so
much
to
recruit
volunteers
as
to
superintend
the
organisation
of
those
already
raised
and
muster
them
into
service
a
corps
had
already
advanced
some
length
towards
formation
having
elected
its
own
officers
and
enrolled
most
of
its
rank
and
file
our
part
was
to
inspect
instruct
and
govern
them
the
little
church
near
the
centre
of
the
settlement
was
the
of
the
corps
and
there
the
drill
was
daily
carried
on
the
men
were
mostly
of
the
poorer
class
of
white
settlers
small
renting
planters
and
squatters
who
dwelt
along
the
and
who
managed
to
eke
out
a
precarious
subsistence
partly
by
the
use
of
their
axes
and
partly
from
the
product
of
their
rifles
the
old
hunter
hickman
was
among
the
number
and
what
did
not
much
surprise
me
i
found
the
worthies
spence
and
williams
enrolled
in
the
corps
upon
these
scamps
i
was
determined
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
and
hold
them
at
a
wary
distance
many
of
the
privates
were
men
of
a
higher
class
for
the
common
danger
had
called
all
kinds
into
the
field
the
officers
were
usually
planters
of
wealth
and
influence
though
there
were
some
who
from
the
democratic
influence
of
elections
were
but
ill
qualified
to
wear
epaulettes
many
of
these
gentlemen
bore
far
higher
official
titles
than
either
gallagher
or
myself
colonels
and
majors
appeared
to
be
almost
as
numerous
as
privates
but
for
all
this
they
did
not
demur
to
our
exercising
authority
over
them
in
actual
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
lieutenant
of
the
line
or
the
lowest
subaltern
of
the
regular
army
to
be
placed
in
command
of
a
full
colonel
of
militia
or
volunteers
here
and
there
was
an
odd
character
who
perhaps
in
earlier
life
had
broken
down
at
west
point
or
had
gone
through
a
month
of
campaigning
service
in
the
greek
wars
under
old
hickory
these
fancying
themselves
in
the
military
art
were
not
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
and
at
times
it
required
all
gallagher
determined
firmness
to
convince
them
that
was
upon
the
suwanee
my
friend
reputation
as
a
fire
eater
which
had
preceded
him
had
as
much
weight
in
confirming
his
authority
as
the
commission
which
he
brought
with
him
from
upon
the
whole
we
got
along
smoothly
enough
with
these
gentlemen
most
of
whom
seemed
desirous
of
learning
their
duty
and
submitted
to
our
instructions
with
cheerfulness
there
was
no
lack
of
champagne
brandy
and
cigars
the
neighbouring
planters
were
hospitable
and
had
my
friend
or
myself
been
inclined
towards
dissipation
we
could
not
have
been
established
in
better
quarters
for
indulging
the
propensity
to
this
however
neither
of
us
gave
way
and
our
moderation
no
doubt
caused
us
to
be
held
in
higher
esteem
even
among
the
hard
drinkers
by
whom
we
were
surrounded
our
new
life
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
and
but
for
the
unpleasantness
that
had
arisen
at
home
i
could
have
felt
for
the
time
contented
and
happy
at
home
at
home
there
was
the
canker
it
appeared
no
longer
a
home
chapter
fifty
six
mysterious
changes
not
many
days
had
elapsed
before
i
observed
a
sudden
change
in
the
conduct
of
gallagher
not
towards
myself
or
my
mother
but
in
his
manner
towards
virginia
it
was
the
day
after
i
had
held
the
conversation
with
her
that
i
first
noticed
this
i
noticed
at
the
same
time
that
her
manner
towards
him
was
equally
altered
the
somewhat
frosty
politeness
that
had
hitherto
been
observed
between
them
appeared
to
have
suddenly
thawed
and
their
old
genial
friendship
to
become
reestablished
on
its
former
footing
they
now
played
and
sang
and
laughed
together
and
read
and
chattered
nonsense
as
they
had
been
used
to
do
in
times
past
ah
thought
i
it
is
easy
for
him
to
forget
he
is
but
a
friend
and
of
course
can
not
have
the
feelings
of
a
brother
little
matters
it
to
him
what
may
be
her
secret
relations
or
with
whom
what
need
he
care
about
her
improprieties
she
is
good
company
and
her
winning
way
has
beguiled
him
from
dwelling
upon
that
suspicion
which
he
must
have
entertained
as
well
as
myself
he
has
either
forgotten
forgiven
or
else
found
some
explanation
of
her
conduct
that
seems
to
satisfy
him
at
all
events
appear
to
have
lost
his
sympathy
while
has
regained
his
confidence
and
friendship
i
was
at
first
astonished
at
this
new
phase
in
the
relations
of
our
family
circle
afterwards
puzzled
by
it
i
was
too
proud
and
piqued
to
ask
gallagher
for
an
explanation
and
as
he
did
not
volunteer
to
give
one
i
was
compelled
to
abide
in
ignorance
i
perceived
that
my
mother
also
regarded
this
altered
behaviour
with
surprise
and
also
with
a
feeling
of
a
somewhat
different
kind
suspicion
i
could
guess
the
reason
of
this
she
fancied
that
they
were
growing
too
fond
of
each
other
that
notwithstanding
he
had
no
fortune
but
his
virginia
might
fancy
the
dashing
soldier
for
a
husband
of
course
my
mother
having
already
formed
designs
as
to
the
disposal
of
her
daughter
could
not
calmly
contemplate
such
a
destiny
as
this
it
was
natural
enough
then
she
should
look
with
a
jealous
eye
upon
the
gay
confidence
that
had
been
established
between
them
i
should
have
been
glad
if
i
could
have
shared
my
mother
suspicions
happy
if
my
sister
had
but
fixed
her
affections
there
my
friend
would
have
been
welcome
to
call
me
brother
fortuneless
though
he
might
be
i
should
have
made
no
opposition
to
that
alliance
but
it
never
entered
my
thoughts
that
there
was
aught
between
the
two
but
the
old
rollicking
friendship
and
love
acts
not
in
that
style
so
far
as
captain
gallagher
was
concerned
i
could
have
given
my
mother
assurance
that
would
have
quieted
her
fears
and
yet
to
a
stranger
they
might
have
appeared
as
lovers
almost
to
any
one
except
myself
they
were
together
half
the
day
and
half
the
night
they
rode
together
into
the
woods
and
were
sometimes
absent
for
hours
at
a
time
i
perceived
that
my
comrade
began
to
care
little
for
company
and
daily
less
stranger
still
the
chase
no
longer
delighted
him
as
for
duty
this
he
sadly
neglected
and
had
not
the
lieutenant
been
on
the
ground
i
fear
the
corps
would
have
stood
little
chance
of
instruction
as
days
passed
on
i
fancied
that
gallagher
began
to
relapse
into
a
more
sober
method
he
certainly
seemed
more
thoughtful
this
was
when
my
sister
was
out
of
sight
it
was
not
the
air
he
had
worn
after
our
arrival
but
very
different
it
certainly
resembled
the
bearing
of
a
man
in
love
he
would
start
on
hearing
my
sister
voice
from
without
his
ear
was
quick
to
catch
every
word
from
her
and
his
eyes
expressed
delight
whenever
she
came
into
the
room
once
or
twice
i
saw
him
gazing
at
her
with
an
expression
upon
his
countenance
that
betokened
more
than
friendship
my
old
suspicions
began
to
return
to
me
after
all
he
be
in
love
with
virginia
certainly
she
was
fair
enough
to
impress
the
heart
even
of
this
adamantine
soldier
gallagher
was
no
lady
man
had
never
been
known
to
seek
conquests
over
the
sex
in
fact
felt
some
awkwardness
in
their
company
my
sister
seemed
the
only
one
before
whom
he
could
converse
with
fluency
or
freedom
notwithstanding
and
after
all
he
be
in
love
i
should
have
been
pleased
to
know
it
could
i
only
have
insured
him
a
reciprocity
of
his
passion
but
alas
that
was
not
in
my
power
i
wondered
whether
ever
thought
of
him
as
a
lover
but
no
she
could
not
not
if
she
was
thinking
of
and
yet
her
behaviour
towards
him
was
at
times
of
such
a
character
that
a
stranger
to
her
eccentricities
would
have
fancied
she
loved
him
even
i
was
mystified
by
her
actions
she
either
had
some
feeling
for
him
beyond
that
of
mere
friendship
or
made
show
of
it
if
he
loved
her
and
she
knew
it
then
her
conduct
was
cruel
in
the
extreme
i
indulged
in
such
speculations
though
only
when
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
dwelling
upon
them
they
were
unpleasant
at
times
even
painful
i
lived
in
a
maze
of
doubt
puzzled
and
perplexed
at
what
was
passing
around
me
but
at
this
time
there
turned
up
a
new
chapter
in
our
family
history
that
in
point
of
mystery
eclipsed
all
others
a
piece
of
information
reached
me
that
if
true
must
sweep
all
these
theories
out
my
mind
i
learned
that
my
sister
was
love
with
arens
in
other
words
that
she
was
listening
to
his
addresses
chapter
fifty
seven
my
informant
this
i
had
upon
the
authority
of
my
faithful
servant
black
jake
upon
almost
any
other
testimony
i
should
have
been
incredulous
but
his
was
unimpeachable
negro
as
he
was
his
perceptions
were
keen
enough
while
his
earnestness
proved
that
he
believed
what
he
said
he
had
reasons
and
he
gave
them
i
received
the
strange
intelligence
in
this
wise
i
was
seated
by
the
alone
busied
with
a
book
when
i
heard
jake
familiar
voice
pronouncing
my
name
massr
george
well
jake
i
responded
without
withdrawing
my
eyes
from
the
page

massr

the
solemn
tone
so
unusual
in
the
voice
of

awoke
my
attention
mechanically
closing
the
book

looked
up
in
his

was
solemn
as

smiling
considering

appeared
to
hold
very
exalted
views
of
the
unapproachableness
of
his
charmer
by
those
of
her

race
i
had
once

so
you
may
make

mind
easy

massr
george
you
nebber
fear
i
come
fass
enuff
like
a
streak
ob
de
greased
lightnin
and
with
this
promise
the
black
left
me
with
all
my
disposition
to
be
incredulous
i
could
not
disregard
the
information
thus
imparted
to
me
beyond
doubt
there
was
truth
in
it
the
black
was
too
faithful
to
think
of
deceiving
me
and
too
astute
to
be
himself
deceived
viola
had
rare
opportunities
for
observing
all
that
passed
within
our
family
circle
and
what
motive
could
she
have
for
inventing
a
tale
like
this
besides
jake
had
himself
seen
ringgold
on
visits
of
which
had
never
been
informed
this
confirmed
the
other
confirmed
all
what
was
i
to
make
of
it
three
who
appear
as
lovers
the
chief
gallagher
arens
ringgold
has
she
grown
wicked
abandoned
and
is
coquetting
with
all
the
world
can
she
have
a
thought
of
ringgold
no
it
is
not
possible
i
could
understand
her
having
an
affection
for
the
soldier
a
romantic
passion
for
the
brave
and
certainly
handsome
chief
but
for
arens
ringgold
a
squeaking
conceited
snob
with
nought
but
riches
to
recommend
him
this
appeared
utterly
improbable
of
course
the
influence
was
my
mother
but
never
before
had
i
entertained
a
thought
that
virginia
would
yield
if
viola
spoke
the
truth
she
had
yielded
or
was
yielding

the
morning
after
i
went
as
usual
to
the
recruiting
quarters
gallagher
was
along
with
me
as
upon
this
day
the
volunteers
were
to
be
mustered
into
service
note
and
our
presence
was
necessary
at
the
administering
of
the
oath
a
goodly
company
was
collected
forming
a
troop
more
respectable
in
numbers
than
appearance
they
were
mounted
volunteers
but
as
each
individual
had
been
his
own
quartermaster
no
two
were
either
armed
or
mounted
alike
nearly
all
carried
rifles
though
there
were
a
few
who
shouldered
the
old
family
musket
a
relic
of
revolutionary
times
and
were
simply
armed
with
single
or
double
barrelled
these
however
loaded
with
heavy
would
be
no
contemptible
weapons
in
a
skirmish
with
indians
there
were
pistols
of
many
sorts
from
the
huge
holsters
to
small

and
double
barrelled
but
no
revolvers
for
as
yet
the
celebrated
colt
note
had
not
made
its
appearance
in
frontier
warfare
every
volunteer
carried
his
knife
some
with
ornamented
hafts
while
the
greater
number
were
long
keen
blades
similar
to
those
in
use
among
butchers
in
the
belts
of
many
were
stuck
small
hatchets
an
imitation
of
the
indian
tomahawk

were

serve

of

were

of
the

old

was
among
the
most
active
his
age
and
experience
had
procured
him
the
rank
of
sergeant
by
free
election
and
i
had
many
opportunities
of
conversing
with
him
the
was
still
my
true
friend
and
devoted
to
the
interests
of
our
family
on
this
very
day
i
chanced
to
be
with
him
alone
when
he
gave
proof
of
his
attachment
by
volunteering
a
conversation
i
little
expected
from
him
thus
he
began

now
proceeded
at
my
request
to
detail
with
more
minuteness
than
i
had
yet
heard
them
the
facts
connected
with
the
robbery
of
the
unfortunate
family
it
appeared
by
his
account
that
the
powells
had
not
voluntarily
gone
away
from
the
plantation
that
on
the
contrary
their
removal
had
been
to
the
friendless
widow
the
most
painful
thing
of
all
not
only
was
the
land
of
great
value
the
best
in
the
whole
district
but
it
had
been
to
her
the
scene
of
a
happy
life
a
home
endeared
by
early
love
by
the
memory
of
a
kind
husband
by
every
tie
of
the
heart
affection
and
she
had
only
parted
from
it
when
driven
out
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
by
the
staff
of
the
sheriff
officer
hickman
had
been
present
at
the
parting
scene
and
described
it
in
rough
but
feeling
terms
he
told
me
of
the
sad
unwillingness
which
the
family
exhibited
at
parting
of
the
indignant
reproaches
of
the
son
of
the
tears
and
entreaties
of
mother
and
daughter
how
the
persecuted
widow
had
offered
everything
left
her
her
personal
property
even
the
trinkets
and
jewels
souvenirs
given
her
by
her
departed
husband
if
the
ruffians
would
only
allow
her
to
remain
in
possession
of
the
house
the
old
homestead
consecrated
to
her
by
long
happy
years
spent
under
its
roof
her
appeals
were
in
vain
the
heartless
persecutor
was
without
compassion
and
she
was
driven
forth
of
all
these
things
the
old
hunter
spoke
freely
and
feelingly
for
although
a
man
of
somewhat
vulgar
speech
and
rough
exterior
he
was
one
whose
heart
beat
with
humanity
and
who
hated
injustice
he
had
no
friendship
for
mere
and
he
heartily
detested
the
whole
tribe
of
the
ringgolds
his
narration
within
me
the
indignant
emotions
i
had
experienced
on
first
hearing
of
this
monstrous
act
of
cruelty
and
my
sympathy
for
osceola
interrupted
by
late
suspicions
was
almost
restored

i
stood

fifty
nine
a
hasty
messenger
in
the
company
of
hickman
i
had
walked
off
to
some
distance
from
the
crowd
in
order
that
our
conversation
should
be
unrestrained
as
the
moments
passed
the
old
hunter
warmed
into
greater
freedom
of
speech
and
from
his
manner
i
fancied
he
had
still
other
developments
to
make
i
had
firm
faith
in
his
devotion
to
our
family
as
well
as
in
his
personal
friendship
for
myself
and
once
or
twice
i
was
on
the
eve
of
revealing
to
him
the
thoughts
that
rendered
me
unhappy
in
experience
he
was
a
sage
and
although
a
rude
one
he
might
be
the
best
counsellor
i
could
find
i
knew
no
other
who
possessed
half
his
knowledge
of
the
world
for
hickman
had
not
always
lived
among
the
alligators
on
the
contrary
he
had
passed
through
various
phases
of
life
i
could
safely
trust
to
his
devotedness
with
equal
safety
i
might
confide
in
the
resources
of
his
judgment
under
this
belief
i
should
have
unburdened
myself
of
the
heavy
secrets
weighing
upon
my
mind
of
some
of
them
at
least
had
it
not
been
that
i
fancied
he
already
knew
some
of
them
with
the
of
yellow
jake
i
knew
him
to
be
acquainted
he
alleged
that
he
had
never
felt
sure
about
the
mulatto
death
and
had
heard
long
ago
that
he
was
alive
but
it
was
not
of
him
i
was
thinking
but
of
the
designs
of
arens
ringgold
perhaps
hickman
knew
something
of
these
i
noticed
that
when
his
name
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
those
of
spence
and
williams
he
glanced
towards
me
a
look
of
strange
significance
as
if
he
had
something
to
say
of
these
wretches
i
was
waiting
for
him
to
make
a
disclosure
when
the
footfall
of
a
horse
fell
upon
my
ear
on
looking
up
i
perceived
a
horseman
coming
down
the
bank
of
the
river
and
galloping
as
earnestly
as
if
riding
a
the
horse
was
white
and
the
rider
black
i
recognised
both
at
a
glance
jake
was
the
horseman
i
stepped
out
from
among
the
trees
in
order
that
he
should
see
me
and
not
pass
on
to
the
church
that
stood
a
little
beyond
i
hailed
him
as
he
advanced
he
both
saw
and
heard
me
and
abruptly
turning
his
horse
came
galloping
up
to
the
spot
where
the
old
hunter
and
i
were
standing
he
was
evidently
upon
an
errand
but
the
presence
of
hickman
prevented
him
from
declaring
it
aloud
it
would
not
keep
however
and
throwing
himself
from
the
saddle
he
drew
near
me
and
whispered
it
into
my
ear
it
was
just
what
i
was
expecting
to
hear
arens
ringgold
was
at
the
house
that
dam
nigga
am
thar
massr
george
such
was
literally
jake
muttered
announcement
i
received
the
communication
with
as
much
show
of
tranquillity
as
i
could
assume
i
did
not
desire
that
hickman
should
have
any
knowledge
of
its
nature
nor
even
a
suspicion
that
there
was
anything
extraordinary
upon
the
so
dismissing
the
black
messenger
with
a
word
i
turned
away
with
the
hunter
and
walking
back
to
the
church
enclosure
contrived
to
lose
him
in
the
crowd
of
his
comrades
soon
after
i
released
my
horse
from
his
fastening
and
without
saying
a
word
to
any
one
not
even
to
gallagher
i
mounted
and
moved
quietly
off
i
did
not
take
the
direct
road
that
led
to
our
plantation
but
made
a
short
circuit
through
some
woods
that
skirted
close
to
the
church
i
did
this
to
mislead
old
hickman
or
any
other
who
might
have
noticed
the
rapid
arrival
of
the
messenger
and
who
had
i
gone
directly
back
with
him
might
have
held
guesses
that
all
was
not
right
at
home
to
prevent
this
i
appeared
to
curious
eyes
to
have
gone
in
an
opposite
direction
to
the
right
one
a
little
rough
riding
through
the
bushes
brought
me
out
into
the
main
road
and
then
sinking
the
spur
i
galloped
as
if
life
or
death
were
staked
upon
the
issue
my
object
in
making
such
haste
was
simply
to
get
to
the
house
in
time
before
the
clandestine
visitor
welcome
guest
of
mother
and
sister
should
make
his
adieus
strong
reasons
as
i
had
for
hating
this
man
i
had
no
sanguinary
purpose
it
was
not
my
design
to
kill
arens
ringgold
though
such
might
have
been
the
most
proper
mode
to
dispose
of
a
reptile
so
vile
and
dangerous
as
he
knowing
him
as
i
did
freshly
spurred
to
angry
passion
by
hickman
narrative
of
his
atrocious
behaviour
i
could
at
that
moment
have
taken
his
life
without
fear
of
remorse
but
although
i
felt
fierce
indignation
i
was
yet
neither
mad
nor
reckless
prudential
motives
the
ordinary
instinct
of
still
had
their
influence
over
me
and
i
had
no
intention
to
imitate
the
last
act
in
the
tragedy
of
samson
life
the
programme
i
had
sketched
out
for
myself
was
of
a
more
rational
character
my
design
was
to
approach
the
house
if
possible
unobserved
the
as
well
where
of
course
the
visitor
would
be
found
an
abrupt
upon
the
scene
both
guest
and
hosts
taken
by
surprise
the
demand
of
an
explanation
from
all
three
a
complete
of
this
mysterious
of
our
family
relations
that
was
so
painfully
perplexing
me
face
to
face
i
should
confront
the
triad
mother
sister
wooer
and
force
all
three
to
confession
yes
soliloquised
i
with
the
eagerness
of
my
intention
driving
the
spur
into
the
flanks
of
my
horse
yes
confess
they
shall
they
must
one
and
all
or
with
the
first
two
i
could
not
define
the
alternative
though
some
dark
design
based
upon
the
slight
of
filial
and
fraternal
love
was
lurking
within
my
bosom
for
ringgold
should
he
refuse
to
give
the
truth
my
resolve
was
first
to
cowhide
him
then
kick
him
out
of
doors
and
finally
command
him
never
again
to
enter
the
house
the
house
of
which
henceforth
i
was
determined
to
be
master
as
for
etiquette
that
was
out
of
the
question
at
that
hour
my
soul
was
ill
attuned
to
the
observance
of
delicate
ceremony
no
rudeness
could
be
amiss
in
dealing
with
the
man
who
had
tried
to
murder
me
chapter
sixty
a
lover
gift
as
i
have
said
it
was
my
design
to
make
an
entrance
unobserved
consequently
it
was
necessary
to
observe
caution
in
approaching
the
house
to
this
end
as
i
drew
near
the
plantation
i
turned
off
the
main
road
into
a
path
that
led
circuitously
by
the
rear
this
path
would
conduct
me
by
the
hommock
the
and
the
without
much
danger
of
my
approach
being
noticed
by
any
one
the
slaves
at
work
within
the
enclosures
could
see
me
as
i
rode
through
the
grounds
but
these
were
the
unless
seen
by
some
of
the
domestics
engaged
in
household
affairs
i
had
no
fear
of
being
announced
my
messenger
had
not
gone
directly
back
i
had
ordered
him
to
await
me
in
an
appointed
place
and
there
i
found
him
directing
him
to
follow
me
i
kept
on
and
having
passed
through
the
fields
we
rode
into
the
thick
underwood
of
the
hommock
where
halting
we
dismounted
from
our
horses
from
this
point
i
proceeded
alone
as
the
hunter
steals
upon
the
unexpecting
game
or
the
savage
upon
his
sleeping
foe
did
i
approach
the
house
my
home
my
father
home
the
home
of
mother
and
sister
strange
conduct
in
a
son
and
a
brother
a
singular
situation
my
limbs
trembled
under
me
as
i
advanced
my
knees
knocked
together
my
breast
was
agitated
by
a
tumult
of
wild
emotions
once
i
hesitated
and
halted
the
prospect
of
the
unpleasant
scene
i
was
about
to
produce
stayed
me
my
resolution
was
growing
weak
and
undecided
perhaps
i
might
have
gone
back
perhaps
i
might
have
waited
another
opportunity
when
i
might
effect
my
purpose
by
a
less
violent
development
but
just
then
voices
fell
upon
my
ear
the
effect
of
which
was
to
strengthen
my
wavering
resolves
my
sister
voice
was
ringing
in
laughter
that
sounded
light
and
gay
there
was
another
only
one
i
easily
recognised
the
squeaking
treble
of
her
despicable
suitor
the
voices
remaddened
me
the
tones
stung
me
as
if
they
had
been
designedly
uttered
in
mockery
of
myself
how
could
she
behave
thus
how
riot
in
joy
while
i
was
drooping
under
dark
suspicions
of
her
misbehaviour
piqued
as
well
as
pained
i
surrendered
all
thought
of
honourable
action
i
resolved
to
carry
through
my
design
but
first
to
play
the
listener
i
drew
nearer
and
heard
clearer
the
speakers
were
not
in
the
house
but
outside
by
the
edge
of
the
orange
grove
softly
treading
gently
parting
the
boughs
now
crouching
beneath
them
now
gliding
erect
i
arrived
unobserved
within
six
paces
of
where
they
stood
near
enough
to
perceive
their
dresses
glistening
through
the
leaves
to
hear
every
word
that
passed
between
them
not
many
had
been
spoken
before
i
perceived
that
i
had
arrived
at
a
peculiar
moment
a
crisis
the
lover
had
just
offered
himself
for
a
husband
had
perhaps
for
the
first
time
seriously
made
his
declaration
in
all
probability
it
was
this
had
been
eliciting
my
sister
laughter
and
really
mr
ringgold
you
wish
to
make
me
your
wife
you
are
in
earnest
in
what
you
have
said
nay
miss
randolph
do
not
mock
me
you
know
for
how
many
years
i
have
been
devoted
to
you
indeed
i
do
not
how
could
i
know
that
by
my
words
have
i
not
told
you
so
a
hundred
times
words
i
hold
words
of
little
value
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
dozens
have
talked
to
me
as
you
who
i
suppose
cared
very
little
about
me
the
tongue
is
a
great
trifler
mr
arens
but
my
actions
prove
my
sincerity
i
have
offered
you
my
hand
and
my
fortune
is
not
that
a
sufficient
proof
of
devotion
no
silly
fellow
nothing
of
the
sort
were
i
to
become
your
wife
the
fortune
would
still
remain
your
own
besides
i
have
some
little
fortune
myself
and
that
would
come
under
your
control
so
you
see
the
advantage
would
be
decidedly
in
your
favour
ha
ha
ha
nay
miss
randolph
i
should
not
think
of
controlling
yours
and
if
you
will
accept
my
hand
your
hand
sir
if
you
would
win
a
woman
you
should
offer
your
hearts
not
hands
for
me
you
know
that
is
yours
already
and
has
been
for
long
years
all
the
world
knows
it
you
must
have
told
the
world
then
and
i
do
like
it
a
bit
really
you
are
too
harsh
with
me
you
have
had
many
proofs
of
how
long
and
devotedly
i
have
admired
you
i
would
have
declared
myself
long
since
and
asked
you
to
become
my
wife
and
why
did
you
not
ringgold
hesitated
the
truth
is
i
was
not
my
own
master
i
was
under
the
control
of
my
father
indeed
that
exists
no
longer
i
can
now
act
as
i
please
and
dearest
miss
randolph
if
you
will
but
accept
my
hand
your
hand
again
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
this
hand
of
yours
has
not
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
open
one
should
i
accept
it
it
might
prove
sparing
of
ha
ha
ha
i
am
aspersed
by
enemies
i
swear
to
you
that
in
that
sense
you
should
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
my
liberality
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
notwithstanding
the
oath
you
would
take
promises
made
before
marriage
are
too
often
broken
after
i
would
not
trust
you
my
man
not
i
i
faith
but
you
can
trust
me
i
assure
you
you
can
not
assure
me
besides
have
had
no
proofs
of
your
liberality
in
the
past
why
mr
ringgold
you
never
made
me
a
present
in
your
life
ha
ha
ha
had
i
known
you
would
have
accepted
one
it
would
gratify
me
miss
randolph
i
would
give
you
anything
i
possess
good
now
i
shall
put
you
to
the
test
you
shall
make
me
a
gift
name
it
it
shall
be
yours
oh
you
fancy
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
some
trifling
affair
a
horse
a
poodle
or
some
bit
of
glittering
nothing
of
the
sort
i
assure
you
i
care
not
what
i
have
offered
you
my
whole
fortune
and
therefore
will
not
hesitate
to
give
you
a
part
of
it
only
specify
what
you
may
desire
and
i
shall
freely
give
it
that
sounds
liberal
indeed
very
well
then
you
have
something
i
desire
to
possess
and
very
much
desire
it
in
truth
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
be
its
owner
and
had
some
designs
of
making
offers
to
you
for
the
purchase
of
it
what
can
you
mean
miss
randolph
a
plantation
a
plantation
exactly
so
not
your
own
but
one
of
which
you
are
the
proprietor
ah
i
mean
that
which
formerly
belonged
to
a
family
of
upon
tupelo
creek
your
father
it
from
them
i
believe
i
noted
the
emphasis
upon
the
word
purchased
i
noted
hesitation
and
some
confusion
in
the
reply
yes
yes
said
he
it
was
so
but
you
astonish
me
miss
randolph
why
care
you
for
this
when
you
shall
be
mistress
of
all
i
possess
that
is
my
affair
i
care
for
it
i
may
have
many
reasons
that
piece
of
ground
is
a
favourite
spot
with
me
it
is
a
lovely
place
i
often
go
there
remember
my
brother
is
owner
here
he
is
not
likely
to
remain
a
bachelor
all
his
life
and
my
mother
may
desire
to
have
a
home
of
her
own
but
no
i
shall
give
you
no
reasons
make
the
gift
or
not
as
you
please
and
if
i
do
you
will
name
conditions
and
i
will
not
accept
it
not
if
you
ask
me
on
your
knees
ha
ha
ha
i
shall
make
none
then
if
you
will
accept
it
it
is
yours
ah
that
is
not
all
master
arens
you
might
take
it
back
just
as
easily
as
you
have
given
it
how
am
i
to
be
sure
that
you
would
not
i
must
have
the
you
shall
have
them
and
when
whenever
you
please
within
the
hour
if
you
desire
it
i
do
then
go
get
them
but
remember
sir
make
no
conditions
remember
oh
exclaimed
the
overjoyed
lover
i
make
none
i
have
no
fears
i
leave
all
to
you
in
an
hour
you
shall
have
them
adieu
and
so
saying
he
made
a
hurried
departure
i
was
so
astonished
by
the
nature
of
this
dialogue
so
taken
by
surprise
at
its
odd
ending
that
for
a
time
i
could
not
stir
from
the
spot
not
until
ringgold
had
proceeded
to
some
distance
did
i
recover
and
then
i
hesitated
what
course
to
pursue
whether
to
follow
him
or
permit
him
to
depart
unmolested
virginia
had
gone
away
from
the
ground
having
glided
silently
back
into
the
house
i
was
even
angrier
with
her
than
with
him
and
obedient
to
this
impulse
i
left
ringgold
to
go
free
and
went
straight
for
an
explanation
with
my
sister
it
proved
a
somewhat
stormy
scene
i
found
her
in
the
in
company
with
my
mother
i
stayed
for
no
circumlocution
i
listened
to
no
denial
or
appeal
but
openly
announced
to
both
the
character
of
the
man
who
had
just
left
the
house
openly
declared
him
my
intended
murderer
now
virginia
sister
will
you
marry
this
man
never
george
never
i
never
intended
it
never
she
repeated
emphatically
as
she
sank
upon
the
sofa
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
my
mother
was
incredulous
even
yet
incredulous
i
was
proceeding
to
the
proofs
of
the
astounding
declaration
i
had
made
when
i
heard
my
name
loudly
pronounced
outside
the
window
some
one
was
calling
me
in
haste
i
ran
out
upon
the
verandah
to
inquire
what
was
wanted
in
front
was
a
man
on
horseback
in
blue
uniform
with
yellow
facings
a
dragoon
he
was
an
orderly
a
messenger
from
the
fort
he
was
covered
with
dust
his
horse
was
in
a
lather
of
sweat
and
foam
the
condition
of
both
horse
and
man
showed
that
they
had
been
going
for
hours
at
the
man
handed
me
a
piece
of
paper
a
dispatch
hastily
scrawled
it
was
addressed
to
gallagher
and
myself
i
opened
and
read
bring
on
your
men
to
fort
king
as
fast
as
their
horses
can
carry
them
the
enemy
is
around
us
in
numbers
every
rifle
is
wanted
lose
not
a
moment
clinch
chapter
sixty
one
the
route
the
dispatch
called
for
instant
obedience
fortunately
my
horse
was
still
under
the
saddle
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
was
upon
his
back
and
galloping
for
the
volunteer
camp
among
these
eager
warriors
the
news
produced
a
joyous
excitement
expressed
in
a
wild
enthusiasm
supplied
the
place
of
discipline
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
corps
was
accoutred
and
ready
for
the
road
there
was
nothing
to
cause
delay
the
command
to
march
was
given
the
bugle
sounded
the
forward
and
the
troop
filing
by
twos
into
a
long
somewhat
irregular
line
took
the
route
for
fort
king
i
galloped
home
to
say
adieu
it
was
a
hurried
less
happy
than
my
last
but
i
rode
away
with
more
contentment
under
the
knowledge
that
my
sister
was
now
warned
and
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
of
an
alliance
with
arens
ringgold
the
orderly
who
brought
the
dispatch
rode
back
with
the
troop
as
we
marched
along
he
communicated
the
and
rumours
in
circulation
at
the
fort
many
events
had
occurred
of
which
we
had
not
heard
the
indians
had
forsaken
their
towns
taking
with
them
their
wives
children
cattle
and
chattels
some
of
their
villages
they
had
themselves
fired
leaving
nothing
for
their
enemies
to
destroy
this
proved
a
determination
to
engage
in
a
general
war
had
other
proofs
of
this
disposition
been
wanting
whither
they
had
gone
even
our
spies
had
been
unable
to
find
out
it
was
supposed
by
some
that
they
had
moved
farther
south
to
a
more
distant
part
of
the
peninsula
others
alleged
that
they
had
betaken
themselves
to
the
great
swamp
that
stretches
for
many
leagues
around
the
of
the
amazura
river
and
known
as
the
cove
of
the
ouithlacoochee
this
last
conjecture
was
the
more
likely
though
so
secretly
and
adroitly
had
they
managed
their
migration
that
not
a
trace
of
the
movement
could
be
detected
the
spies
of
the
friendly
indians
the
keenest
that
could
be
employed
were
unable
to
discover
their
retreat
it
was
supposed
that
they
intended
to
act
only
on
the
defensive
that
is
to
make
plundering
forays
on
whatever
quarter
was
left
unguarded
by
troops
and
then
retire
with
their
booty
to
the
fastnesses
of
the
swamp
their
conduct
up
to
this
time
had
rendered
the
supposition
probable
enough
in
such
case
the
war
might
not
be
so
easily
brought
to
a
termination
in
other
words
there
might
be
no
war
at
all
but
a
succession
of
fruitless
marches
and
pursuits
for
it
was
well
enough
understood
that
if
the
indians
did
not
choose
to
stand
before
us
in
action
we
should
have
but
little
chance
of
overhauling
them
in
their
retreat
the
fear
of
the
troops
was
that
their
adversaries
would
take
to
the
cover
where
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
altogether
impossible
to
find
them
however
this
state
of
things
could
not
be
perpetual
the
indians
could
not
always
subsist
upon
plunder
where
the
booty
must
be
every
day
growing
less
they
were
too
numerous
for
a
mere
band
of
robbers
though
there
existed
among
the
whites
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
their
numbers
estimates
placed
them
at
from
one
to
five
thousand
souls
runaway
negroes
included
and
even
the
best
informed
frontiersmen
could
give
only
rude
guesses
on
this
point
for
my
part
i
believed
that
there
were
more
than
a
thousand
warriors
even
after
the
defection
of
the
traitor
clans
and
this
was
the
opinion
of
one
who
knew
them
well
old
hickman
the
hunter
how
then
were
so
many
to
find
subsistence
in
the
middle
of
a
morass
had
they
been
provident
and
there
accumulated
a
grand
commissariat
no
this
question
could
at
once
be
answered
in
the
negative
it
was
that
the
contrary
was
the
case
for
in
this
year
the
seminoles
were
without
even
their
usual
supply
their
removal
had
been
urged
in
the
spring
and
in
consequence
of
the
doubtful
prospect
before
them
many
had
planted
little
some
not
at
all
the
crop
therefore
was
less
than
in
ordinary
years
and
previous
to
the
final
council
at
fort
king
numbers
of
them
had
been
both
buying
and
begging
food
from
the
frontier
citizens
what
likelihood
then
of
finding
subsistence
throughout
a
long
campaign
they
would
be
starved
out
of
their
fortresses
they
must
come
out
and
either
stand
fight
or
sue
for
peace
so
people
believed
this
topic
was
discoursed
as
we
rode
along
it
was
one
of
primary
interest
to
all
young
warriors
thirsting
for
fame
inasmuch
as
should
the
enemy
determine
to
pursue
so
inglorious
a
system
of
warfare
where
were
the
laurels
to
be
plucked
a
campaign
in
the
miasmatic
and
pestilential
climate
of
the
swamps
was
more
likely
to
yield
a
luxuriant
crop
of
cypresses
most
hoped
and
hence
believed
that
the
indians
would
soon
grow
hungry
and
shew
themselves
in
a
fair
field
of
fight
there
were
different
opinions
as
to
the
possibility
of
their
subsisting
themselves
for
a
lengthened
period
of
time
some
and
these
were
men
best
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
country
expressed
their
belief
that
they
could

as

darnationed

that
what
thu
do
this
sage
reasoning
produced
conviction
in
the
minds
of
those
who
heard
it
after
all
the
dispersed
enemy
might
not
be
so
helpless
as
was
generally
imagined
the
march
of
the
volunteers
was
not
conducted
in
a
strict
military
style
it
was
so
commenced
but
the
officers
soon
found
it
impossible
to
carry
out
the
tactics
the
men
especially
the
younger
ones
could
not
be
restrained
from
occasionally
falling
out
of
the
lines
to
help
themselves
to
a
pull
out
of
some
flask
and
at
intervals
one
would
gallop
off
into
the
woods
in
hopes
of
getting
a
shot
at
a
deer
or
a
turkey
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
through
the
trees
reasoning
with
these
fellows
on
the
part
of
their
officers
proved
rather
a
fruitless
affair
and
getting
angry
with
them
was
only
to
elicit
a
sulky
rejoinder
sergeant
hickman
was
extremely
wroth
with
some
of
the
offenders
greenhorns
he
exclaimed
darnationed
greenhorns
let
go
on
at
it
may
a
allaygatur
eet
me
if
they
do
behave
i
stake
my
critter
agin
any
hoss
in
the
crowd
that
some
o
them
ere
fellars
get
sculped
afore
sundown
durned
if
they
do
no
one
offered
to
take
the
old
hunter
bet
and
fortunately
for
them
as
his
words
proved
prophetic
a
young
planter
fancying
himself
as
safe
as
if
riding
through
his
own
had
galloped
off
from
the
line
of
march
a
deer
seen
browsing
in
the
savanna
offered
an
attraction
too
strong
to
be
resisted
he
had
not
been
gone
five
minutes
had
scarcely
passed
out
of
sight
of
his
comrades
when
two
shots
were
heard
in
quick
succession
and
the
next
moment
his
riderless
horse
came
galloping
back
to
the
troop
the
line
was
halted
and
faced
in
the
direction
whence
the
shots
had
been
heard
an
advance
party
moved
forward
to
the
ground
no
enemy
was
discovered
nor
the
traces
of
any
except
those
exhibited
in
the
dead
body
of
the
young
planter
that
lay
perforated
with
a
brace
of
bullets
just
as
it
had
fallen
out
of
the
saddle
it
was
a
lesson
though
an
unpleasant
one
to
his
comrades
and
after
this
there
were
no
more
attempts
at
the
man
was
buried
on
the
spot
where
he
lay
and
with
the
troop
more
regularly
and
compactly
formed
now
an
easier
duty
for
its
officers
we
continued
the
march
unmolested
and
before
sunset
were
within
the
stockade
of
the
fort
chapter
sixty
two
a
knock
on
the
head
excepting
the
memory
of
one
short
hour
fort
king
had
for
me
no
pleasant
reminiscences
there
had
been
some
new
arrivals
in
my
absence
but
none
of
them
worthy
of
companionship
they
only
rendered
quarters
more
crowded
and
accommodation
more
difficult
to
obtain
the
sutlers
and
the
blacklegs
were
rapidly
making
their
fortunes
and
these
with
the
quartermaster
the
commissary
note
and
the
appeared
to
be
the
only
prosperous
men
about
the
place
the
beau
was
still
chief
gaily
caparisoned
as
ever
but
of
him
i
had
almost
ceased
to
think
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
ordered
upon
duty
almost
the
moment
after
my
arrival
and
that
as
usual
of
a
disagreeable
kind
before
i
had
time
to
obtain
a
moment
rest
after
the
long
ride
even
before
i
could
wash
the
from
my
skin
i
was
summoned
to
the
of
the
what
could
he
want
with
me
in
such
hot
haste
was
it
about
the
duels
were
these
old
scores
going
to
be
reckoned
up
not
without
some
apprehension
did
i
betake
myself
into
the
presence
of
the
general
it
proved
however
to
be
nothing
concerning
the
past
though
when
i
learned
the
duty
i
was
to
perform
i
half
regretted
that
it
was
not
a
reprimand
i
found
the
agent
closeted
with
the
they
had
designed
another
interview
with
omatla
and
black
dirt
i
was
merely
wanted
as
an
interpreter
the
object
of
this
fresh
interview
with
the
chiefs
was
stated
in
my
hearing
it
was
to
arrange
a
plan
for
concerted
action
between
the
troops
and
the
friendly
indians
who
were
to
act
as
our
allies
against
their
own
countrymen
the
latter
as
was
now
known
by
certain
information
being
collected
in
large
force
in
the
cove
of
the
ouithlacoochee
their
actual
position
was
still
unknown
but
that
it
was
confidently
hoped
would
be
discovered
by
the
aid
of
the
friendly
chiefs
and
their
spies
who
were
constantly
on
the
run
the
meeting
had
been
already
the
chiefs
who
as
already
stated
had
gone
to
fort
brooke
and
were
there
living
under
protection
of
the
garrison
were
to
make
a
secret
journey
and
meet
the
agent
and
general
at
an
appointed
place
the
old
ground
the
hommock
by
the
pond
the
meeting
had
been
fixed
for
that
very
night
as
soon
as
it
should
be
dark
enough
to
hide
the
approach
of
both
tempters
and
traitors
it
was
dark
enough
almost
the
moment
the
sun
went
down
for
the
moon
was
in
her
third
quarter
and
would
not
be
in
the
sky
until
after
sunset
shortly
after
twilight
therefore
we
three
proceeded
to
the
spot
the
general
the
agent
and
the
interpreter
just
as
we
had
done
on
the
former
occasion
the
chiefs
were
not
there
and
this
caused
a
little
surprise
by
the
noted
punctuality
with
which
an
indian
keeps
his
assignation
it
was
expected
they
would
have
been
on
the
ground
for
the
hour
appointed
had
arrived
what
is
detaining
them
what
can
be
detaining
them
mutually
inquired
the
commissioner
and
general
scarcely
an
instant
passed
till
the
answer
came
it
came
from
afar
and
in
a
singular
utterance
but
it
could
be
no
other
than
a
reply
to
the
question
so
both
my
companions
conjectured
borne
upon
the
was
the
sound
of
strife
the
sharp
cracking
of
rifles
and
pistols
and
distinctly
heard
above
all
the
shrill
the
sounds
were
distant
away
amid
the
far
woods
but
they
were
sufficiently
distinct
to
admit
of
the
interpretation
that
a
struggle
was
going
on
between
two
parties
of
men
it
could
be
no
feint
no
false
alarm
to
draw
the
soldiers
from
the
fort
or
terrify
the
sentinel
on
his
post
there
was
an
earnestness
in
the
wild
treble
of
those
shrill
cries
that
convinced
the
listener
that
human
blood
was
being
spilled
my
companions
were
busy
with
conjectures
i
saw
that
neither
possessed
a
high
degree
of
courage
for
that
is
not
necessary
to
become
a
general
in
my
warlike
experience
i
have
seen
more
than
one
hiding
behind
a
tree
or
piece
of
a
wall
one
indeed
who
was
afterwards
elected
the
chief
of
twenty
millions
of
people
i
have
seen
skulking
in
a
ditch
to
screen
himself
from
a
stray
shot
while
his
lost
brigade
half
a
mile
in
the
advance
was
gallantly
fighting
under
the
guidance
of
a
but
why
should
i
speak
of
these
things
here
the
world
is
full
of
such
heroes
it
is
they
by
exclaimed
the
commissioner
they
have
been
waylaid
they
are
attacked
by
the
others
that
rascal
powell
for
a
thousand
it
is
extremely
probable
replied
the
other
who
seemed
to
have
a
somewhat
steadier
nerve
and
spoke
more
coolly
yes
it
must
be
there
are
no
troops
in
that
direction
no
whites
either
not
a
man
it
must
therefore
be
an
affair
among
the
indians
themselves
and
what
else
than
attack
upon
the
friendly
chiefs
you
are
right
thompson
it
is
as
you
say
if
so
general
it
will
be
of
no
use
our
remaining
here
if
they
have
waylaid
omatla
they
will
of
course
have
superior
numbers
and
he
must
fall
we
need
not
expect
him
no
he
is
not
likely
to
come
neither
he
nor
lusta
as
you
say
it
is
idle
for
us
to
remain
here
i
think
we
may
as
well
return
to
the
fort
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
during
which
i
fancied
both
generals
were
debating
in
their
own
minds
whether
it
would
be
thus
to
give
up
their
errand
and
purpose
if
they
should
come
continued
the
soldier
general
said
i
taking
the
liberty
to
interrupt
him
if
you
desire
it
i
will
remain
upon
the
ground
for
a
while
and
see
if
they
should
come
i
added
in
continuation
of
the
broken
sentence
i
can
proceed
to
the
fort
and
give
you
notice
i
could
not
have
made
a
proposition
more
agreeable
to
the
two
it
was
instantly
accepted
and
the
brace
of
official
heroes
moved
away
leaving
me
to
myself
it
was
not
long
ere
i
had
cause
to
regret
my
generous
rashness
my
late
companions
could
scarcely
have
reached
the
fort
when
the
sounds
of
the
strife
suddenly
ceased
and
i
heard
the
the
seminole
shout
of
triumph
i
was
still
listening
to
its
wild
intonations
when
men
men
rushed
out
of
the
bushes
and
surrounded
me
where
i
stood
despite
the
poor
light
the
stars
afforded
i
could
see
shining
blades
guns
pistols
and
tomahawks
the
weapons
were
too
near
my
eyes
to
be
mistaken
for
the
that
had
been
glittering
around
my
head
besides
the
clink
of
steel
was
in
my
ears
my
assailants
made
no
outcry
perhaps
because
they
were
too
near
the
fort
and
my
own
shouts
were
soon
suppressed
by
a
blow
that
levelled
me
to
the
earth
depriving
me
as
well
of
consciousness
as
of
speech
note

the
united

these
two
offices
are

chapter
sixty
three
an
indian
executioner
after
a
short
spell
of
obliviousness
i
recovered
my
senses
i
perceived
that
the
indians
were
still
around
me
but
no
longer
in
the
menacing
attitude
in
which
i
had
seen
them
before
being
struck
down
on
the
contrary
they
appeared
to
be
treating
me
with
kindness
one
of
them
held
my
head
upon
his
knee
while
another
was
endeavouring
to
staunch
the
blood
that
was
running
freely
from
a
wound
in
my
temples
the
others
stood
around
regarding
me
with
interest
and
apparently
anxious
about
my
recovery
their
behaviour
caused
me
surprise
for
i
had
no
other
thought
than
that
they
had
intended
to
kill
me
indeed
as
i
sank
under
the
stroke
of
the
tomahawk
my
senses
had
gone
out
under
the
impression
that
i
killed
such
a
reflection
is
not
uncommon
to
those
whom
a
blow
has
suddenly
deprived
of
consciousness
my
surprise
was
of
an
agreeable
character
i
felt
that
i
still
lived
that
i
was
but
little
hurt
and
not
likely
to
receive
any
further
damage
from
those
who
surrounded
me
they
were
speaking
to
one
another
in
low
tones
pronouncing
the
prognosis
of
my
wound
and
apparently
gratified
that
they
had
not
killed
me
we
have
spilled
your
blood
but
it
is
not
dangerous
said
one
addressing
himself
to
me
in
his
native
tongue
it
was
i
who
gave
the
blow
it
was
dark
friend
of
the
rising
sun
we
did
not
know
you
we
thought
you
were
the
the
speaker
the
commissioner
it
is
his
blood
we
intended
to
spill
we
expected
to
find
him
here
he
has
been
here
where
gone
i
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
fort
exclaimed
several
in
a
breath
and
in
a
tone
that
betokened
disappointment
and
then
turning
aside
they
conversed
with
each
other
in
a
low
voice
fear
not
said
the
first
speaker
again
standing
before
me
friend
of
the
rising
sun
we
will
not
do
further
harm
to
you
but
you
must
go
with
us
to
the
chiefs
they
are
not
far
off
come
i
was
once
more
upon
my
feet
and
perhaps
by
a
desperate
effort
might
have
escaped
the
attempt
however
might
have
cost
me
a
second
perhaps
my
life
moreover
the
courtesy
of
my
captors
at
once
set
my
mind
at
ease
go
where
they
might
i
felt
that
i
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
and
without
hesitation
i
consented
to
accompany
them
my
captors
throwing
themselves
into
single
file
and
assigning
me
a
position
in
their
midst
at
once
started
off
through
the
woods
for
some
time
we
walked
rapidly
the
path
taken
by
the
leader
of
the
party
being
easily
followed
even
in
the
darkness
by
those
behind
i
observed
that
we
were
going
in
the
direction
whence
had
been
heard
the
sounds
of
the
conflict
that
had
long
since
ceased
to
vibrate
upon
the
air
of
whatever
nature
had
been
the
struggle
it
was
evidently
brought
to
a
close
and
even
the
victors
no
longer
uttered
the
we
had
advanced
about
a
mile
when
the
moon
arose
and
the
woods
becoming
more
open
i
could
see
my
captors
more
distinctly
i
recognised
the
features
of
one
or
two
of
them
from
having
seen
them
at
the
council
they
were
warriors
of
the
micosauc
tribe
the
followers
of
osceola
from
this
i
conjectured
that
he
was
one
of
the
chiefs
before
whom
i
was
being
conducted
my
conjecture
proved
correct
we
had
not
gone
much
further
when
the
path
led
into
an
opening
in
the
woods
in
the
midst
of
which
a
large
body
of
indians
about
a
hundred
in
all
were
grouped
together
a
little
apart
was
a
smaller
group
the
chiefs
and
head
warriors
in
their
midst
i
observed
osceola
the
ground
exhibited
a
singular
and
sanguinary
spectacle
dead
bodies
were
lying
about
gashed
with
wounds
still
fresh
and
bleeding
some
of
the
dead
lay
upon
their
backs
their
unclosed
eyes
glaring
ghastly
upon
the
moon
all
in
the
attitudes
in
which
they
had
fallen
the
had
done
its
work
as
the
whitish
patch
upon
the
crowns
laced
with
seams
of
crimson
red
shewed
the
skulls
divested
of
their
hirsute
covering
men
were
strolling
about
with
the
fresh
scalps
in
their
hands
or
elevated
upon
the
muzzles
of
their
guns
there
was
no
mystery
in
what
i
saw
i
knew
its
meaning
well
the
men
who
had
fallen
were
of
the
traitor
tribes
the
followers
of
lusta
hajo
and
omatla
according
to
the
arrangement
with
the
commissioner
the
chiefs
had
left
fort
brooke
accompanied
by
a
chosen
band
of
their
retainers
their
intention
had
become
known
to
the
patriots
their
movements
had
been
watched
they
had
been
attacked
on
the
way
and
after
a
short
struggle
overpowered
most
of
them
had
fallen
in
the
melee
a
few
with
the
chief
lusta
hajo
had
contrived
to
escape
while
still
another
few
among
whom
was
omatla
himself
had
been
taken
prisoners
during
the
conflict
and
were
yet
alive
they
had
been
rescued
from
death
only
to
suffer
it
in
a
more
ceremonial
shape
i
saw
the
captives
where
they
stood
close
at
hand
and
fast
bound
to
some
trees
among
them
i
recognised
their
leader
by
the
grace
of
commissioner
thompson
king
of
the
seminole
nation
by
those
around
his
majesty
was
now
regarded
with
but
slight
deference
many
a
willing
regicide
stood
near
him
and
would
have
taken
his
life
without
further
ceremony
but
these
were
restrained
by
the
chiefs
who
opposed
the
violent
proceeding
and
who
had
come
to
the
determination
to
give
omatla
a
trial
according
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
their
nation
as
we
arrived
upon
the
ground
this
trial
was
going
on
the
chiefs
were
in
council
one
of
my
captors
reported
our
arrival
i
noticed
a
murmur
of
disappointment
among
the
chiefs
as
he
finished
making
his
announcement
they
were
disappointed
i
was
not
the
captive
they
had
been
expecting
no
notice
was
taken
of
me
and
i
was
left
free
to
loiter
about
and
watch
their
proceedings
if
i
pleased
the
council
soon
performed
its
duty
the
treason
of
omatla
was
too
to
require
much
canvassing
and
of
course
he
was
found
guilty
and
condemned
to
expiate
the
crime
with
his
life
the
sentence
was
pronounced
in
the
hearing
of
all
present
the
traitor
must
die
a
question
arose
who
was
to
be
his
executioner
there
were
many
who
would
have
volunteered
for
the
office
for
to
take
the
life
of
a
traitor
according
to
indian
philosophy
is
esteemed
an
act
of
honour
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
procuring
an
executioner
many
actually
did
volunteer
but
the
services
of
these
were
declined
by
the
council
this
was
a
matter
to
be
decided
by
vote
the
vote
was
immediately
taken
all
knew
of
the
vow
made
by
osceola
his
followers
were
desirous
he
should
keep
it
and
on
this
account
he
was
unanimously
elected
to
do
the
deed
he
accepted
the
office
knife
in
hand
osceola
approached
the
captive
now
cowering
in
his
bonds
all
gathered
around
to
witness
the
fatal
stab
moved
by
an
impulse
i
could
not
resist
i
drew
near
with
the
rest
we
stood
in
breathless
silence
expecting
every
moment
to
see
the
knife
plunged
into
the
heart
of
the
criminal
we
saw
the
arm
upraised
and
the
blow
given
but
there
was
no
wound
no
blood
the
blow
had
descended
upon
the
thongs
that
bound
the
captive
and
omatla
stood
forth
free
from
his
fastenings
there
was
a
murmur
of
disapprobation
what
could
osceola
mean
did
he
design
that
omatla
should
escape
the
traitor
condemned
by
the
council
by
all
but
it
was
soon
perceived
he
had
no
such
intention
far
different
was
his
design
omatla
said
he
looking
his
adversary
sternly
in
the
face
you
were
once
esteemed
a
brave
man
honoured
by
your
tribe
by
the
whole
seminole
nation
the
white
men
have
corrupted
you
they
have
made
you
a
renegade
to
your
country
and
your
cause
for
all
that
you
shall
not
die
the
death
of
a
dog
i
will
kill
but
not
you
my
heart
revolts
to
slay
a
man
who
is
helpless
and
unarmed
it
shall
be
a
fair
combat
between
us
and
men
shall
see
that
the
right
triumphs
give
him
back
his
weapons
let
him
defend
himself
if
he
can
the
unexpected
proposal
was
received
with
some
disapprobation
there
were
many
who
indignant
at
omatla
treason
and
still
wild
with
the
excitement
produced
by
the
late
conflict
would
have
butchered
him
in
his
bonds
but
all
saw
that
osceola
was
determined
to
act
as
he
had
proposed
and
no
opposition
was
offered
one
of
the
warriors
stepping
forward
handed
his
weapons
to
the
condemned
chief
only
his
tomahawk
and
knife
for
so
osceola
was
himself
armed
this
done
by
a
sort
of
tacit
understanding
the
crowd
drew
back
and
the
two
combatants
stood
alone
in
the
centre
the
struggle
was
brief
as
bloody
almost
at
the
first
blow
osceola
struck
the
hatchet
from
his
antagonist
hand
and
with
another
stroke
rapidly
following
felled
omatla
to
the
earth
for
a
moment
the
victor
was
seen
bending
over
his
fallen
adversary
with
his
long
knife
unsheathed
and
glittering
in
the
moonlight
when
he
rose
erect
the
steel
had
lost
its
sheen
it
was
dimmed
with
crimson
blood
osceola
had
kept
his
oath
he
had
driven
his
blade
through
the
heart
of
the
traitor
omatla
had
ceased
to
live
white
men
afterwards
pronounced
this
deed
an
assassination
a
murder
it
was
not
so
any
more
than
the
death
of
charles
of
caligula
of
tarquin
of
a
hundred
other
tyrants
who
have
oppressed
or
betrayed
their
country
public
opinion
upon
such
matters
is
not
honest
it
takes
its

osceola
was
not
of
this
class
my
situation
was
altogether
singular
as
yet
the
chiefs
had
taken
no
notice
of
my
presence
and
notwithstanding
the
courtesy
which
had
been
extended
to
me
by
those
who
conducted
me
thither
i
was
not
without
some
apprehensions
as
to
my
safety
it
might
please
the
council
excited
as
they
were
with
what
had
just
transpired
and
now
actually
at
war
with
our
people
to
condemn
me
to
a
fate
similar
to
that
which
had
befallen
omatla
i
stood
waiting
their
pleasure
therefore
in
anything
but
a
comfortable
frame
of
mind
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
relieved
from
apprehensions
as
soon
as
the
affair
with
omatla
was
ended
osceola
approached
and
in
a
friendly
manner
stretched
out
his
hand
which
i
was
only
too
happy
to
receive
in
friendship
he
expressed
regret
that
i
had
been
wounded
and
made
captive
by
his
men
explained
the
mistake
and
then
calling
one
of
his
followers
ordered
him
to
guide
me
back
to
the
fort
i
had
no
desire
to
remain
longer
than
i
could
help
upon
such
tragic
ground
and
bidding
the
chief
adieu
i
followed
my
conductor
along

with

ending
as
by
duty
bound
i
delivered
a
report
of
the
scene
i
had
involuntarily
been
witness
to
it
produced
a
lively
excitement
within
the
fort
and
an
expedition
was
instantly
ordered
forth
with
myself
to
act
as
guide
a
bit
of
sheer
folly
the
search
proved
bootless
as
any
one
might
have
prophesied
of
course
we
found
the
place
and
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
fallen
upon
which
the
wolves
had
already
been
ravening
but
we
discovered
no
living
indians
not
even
the
path
by
which
they
had
retreated
the
expedition
consisted
of
several
hundred
men
in

the
whole
garrison
of
the
fort
had
we
gone
out
with
a
smaller
force
in
all
probability
we
should
have
seen
something
of
the
enemy
the
death
of
omatla
was
the
most
serious
incident
that
had
yet
occurred
at
all
events
the
most
important
in
its
bearings
by
the
whites
omatla
had
been
constituted
king
by
killing
the
indians
shewed
their
contempt
for
the
authority
that
had
crowned
him
as
well
as
their
determination
to
resist
all
interference
of
the
kind
omatla
had
been
directly
under
the
protection
of
the
white
chiefs
this
had
been
guaranteed
to
him
by
promise
as
by
treaty
and
therefore
the
taking
his
life
was
a
blow
struck
against
his
patrons
the
government
would
now
be
under
the
necessity
of
avenging
his
death
but
the
incident
had
its
most
important
bearings
upon
the
indians
especially
upon
omatla
own
people
terrified
by
the
example
and
dreading
lest
similar
retribution
might
be
extended
to
themselves
many
of
omatla
tribe
and
warriors
forsook
their
alliance
and
enrolled
themselves
in
the
ranks
of
the
patriots
other
clans
that
had
hitherto
remained
undecided
acting
under
similar
motives
now
declared
their
allegiance
to
the
national
will
and
took
up
arms
without
further
hesitation
the
death
of
omatla
besides
being
an
act
of
stern
justice
was
a
stroke
of
fine
policy
on
the
part
of
the
hostile
indians
it
proved
the
genius
of
him
who
had
conceived
and
carried
it
into
execution
omatla
was
the
first
victim
of
osceola
vow
of
vengeance
soon
after
appeared
the
second
it
was
not
long
before
the
tragedy
of
the
traitor
death
was
eclipsed
by
another
far
more
thrilling
and
significant
one
of
the
chief
actors
in
this
drama
disappears
from
the
stage
on
our
arrival
at
the
fort
it
was
found
that
the
commissariat
was
rapidly
running
short
no
provision
had
been
made
for
so
large
a
body
of
troops
and
no
supplies
could
possibly
reach
fort
king
for
a
long
period
of
time
we
were
to
be
the
victims
of
the
usual
improvidence
exhibited
by
governments
not
accustomed
to
warlike
operations
rations
were
stinted
to
the
verge
of
starvation
and
the
prospect
before
us
began
to
look
very
like
starvation
itself
in
this
emergency
the
performed
an
act
of
great
patriotism
independent
of
his
military
command
general
clinch
was
a
citizen
of
florida
a
proprietor
and
planter
upon
a
large
scale
his
fine
plantation
lay
at
a
short
distance
from
fort
king
his
crop
of
maize
covering
nearly
a
hundred
acres
was
just
ripening
and
this
without
more
ado
was
rationed
out
to
the
army
instead
of
bringing
the
commissariat
to
the
troops
the
reverse
plan
was
adopted
and
the
troops
were
marched
upon
their
food
which
had
yet
to
be
gathered
before
being
eaten
of
the
little
army
were
thus
withdrawn
from
the
fort
leaving
rather
a
weak
garrison
while
a
new
stockade
was
extemporised
on
the
general
plantation
under
the
title
of
fort
drane
there
were
slanderous
people
who
insinuated
that
in
this
curious
matter
the
good
old
general
was
moved
by
other
motives
than
those
of
mere
patriotism
there
was
some
talk
about
uncle
sam
as
a
solvent
and
liberal
paymaster
being
called
upon
to
give
a
good
price
for
the
general
corn
besides
so
long
as
an
army
bivouacked
upon
his
plantation
no
danger
need
be
apprehended
from
the
indian
incendiaries
perhaps
these
insinuations
were
but
the
conceits
of
camp
satire
i
was
not
among
those
transferred
to
the
new
station
i
was
not
a
favourite
with
the
and
no
longer
upon
his
staff
my
duties
kept
me
at
fort
king
where
the
commissioner
also
remained
the
days
passed
tamely
enough
whole
weeks
of
them
an
occasional
visit
to
camp
drane
was
a
relief
to
the
monotony
of
but
this
was
a
rare
occurrence
the
fort
had
been
shorn
of
its
strength
and
was
too
weak
for
us
to
go
much
beyond
its
walls
it
was
that
the
indians
were
in
arms
traces
of
their
presence
had
been
observed
near
the
post
and
a
hunting
excursion
or
even
a
romantic
saunter
in
the
neighbouring
woods
the
usual
resources
of
a
frontier
station
could
not
have
been
made
without
some
peril
during
this
period
i
observed
that
the
commissioner
was
very
careful
in
his
outgoings
and
incomings
he
rarely
passed
outside
the
stockade
and
never
beyond
the
line
of
sentries
whenever
he
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
woods
or
over
the
distant
savanna
a
shadow
of
distrust
appeared
to
overspread
his
features
as
though
he
was
troubled
with
an
apprehension
of
danger
this
was
after
the
death
of
the
traitor
chief
he
had
heard
of
osceola
vow
to
kill
omatla
perhaps
he
had
also
heard
that
the
oath
extended
to
himself
perhaps
he
was
under
the
influence
of
a
presentiment

the

is
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
fort

was
a
continued
scene
of
festivities
the
soldiers
were
released
from

the

were
kept

a

in

army
is
generally
a
thriving
adventurer
with
the
officers
liberal
both
of
cash
and
credit
and
on
festive
occasions
not
unfrequently
their
associate
and
boon
companion
such
was
he
the
sutler
at
fort
king
on
one
of
the
festal
days
he
had
provided
a
sumptuous
dinner
no
one
about
the
fort
so
capable
to
which
the
officers
were
invited
the
commissioner
himself
being
the
honoured
guest
the
banquet
was
set
out
in
the
sutler
own
house
which
as
already
mentioned
stood
outside
the
stockade
several
hundred
yards
off
and
near
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
the
dinner
was
over
and
most
of
the
officers
had
returned
within
the
fort
where
as
it
was
now
getting
near
night
it
was
intended
the
smoking
and
should
be
carried
on
the
commissioner
with
half
a
dozen
others
officers
and
civilian
visitors
still
lingered
to
enjoy
another
glass
under
the
hospitable
roof
where
they
had
eaten
their
dinner
i
was
among
those
who
went
back
within
the
fort
we
had
scarcely
settled
down
in
our
seats
when
we
were
startled
by
a
volley
of
sharp
cracks
which
the
ear
well
knew
to
be
the
reports
of
rifles
at
the
same
instant
was
heard
that
wild
intonation
easily
distinguishable
from
the
shouting
of
civilised
men
the
of
the
indians
we
needed
no
messenger
to
inform
us
what
the
noises
meant
the
enemy
was
upon
the
ground
and
had
made
an
attack
we
fancied
upon
the
fort
itself
we
rushed
into
the
open
air
each
arming
himself
as
best
he
could
once
outside
we
saw
that
the
fort
was
not
assailed
but
upon
looking
over
the
stockade
we
perceived
that
the
house
of
the
sutler
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
savages
plumed
and
painted
in
full
fighting
costume
they
were
in
quick
motion
rushing
from
point
to
point
brandishing
their
weapons
and
yelling
the
straggling
shots
were
still
heard
as
the
fatal
gun
was
pointed
at
some
victim
endeavouring
to
escape
the
gates
of
the
fort
were
standing
wide
open
and
soldiers
who
had
been
strolling
outside
now
rushed
through
uttering
shouts
of
terror
as
they
passed
in
the
sutler
house
was
at
too
great
a
distance
for
the
range
of
musketry
some
shots
were
discharged
by
the
sentries
and
others
who
chanced
to
be
armed
but
the
bullets
fell
short
the
artillerists
ran
to
their
guns
but
on
reaching
these
it
was
found
that
the
stables
a
row
of
heavy
stood
directly
in
the
range
of
the
sutler
house
thus
sheltering
the
enemy
from
the
aim
of
the
gunners
all
at
once
the
shouting
ceased
and
the
crowd
of
dusky
warriors
was
observed
moving
off
towards
the
woods
in
a
few
seconds
they
had
disappeared
among
the
trees
vanishing
as
if
by
magic
from
our
sight
he
who
commanded
at
the
fort
an
officer
slow
of
resolve
now
mustered
the
garrison
and
ventured
a
sortie
it
extended
only
to
the
house
of
the
sutler
where
a
halt
was
made
while
we
contemplated
the
horrid
scene
the
sutler
himself
two
young
officers
several
soldiers
and
civilians
lay
upon
the
floor
dead
each
with
many
wounds
conspicuous
above
all
was
the
corpse
of
the
commissioner
he
was
lying
upon
his
back
his
face
covered
with
gore
and
his
uniform
torn
and
bloody
sixteen
bullets
had
been
fired
into
his
body
and
a
wound
more
terrible
than
all
was
observed
over
the
left
breast
it
was
the
gash
made
by
a
knife
whose
blade
had
passed
through
his
heart
i
could
have
guessed
who
gave
that
wound
even
without
the
living
testimony
that
was
offered
on
the
spot
a
negress
the
cook
who
had
concealed
herself
behind
a
piece
of
furniture
now
came
forth
from
her
she
had
been
witness
of
all
she
was
acquainted
with
the
person
of
osceola
it
was
he
who
had
conducted
the
tragedy
he
had
been
the
last
to
leave
the
scene
and
before
taking
his
departure
the
negress
had
observed
him
give
that
final
stab
no
doubt
in
satisfaction
of
the
deadly
vow
he
had
made
after
some
consultation
a
pursuit
was
determined
upon
and
carried
out
with
considerable
caution
but
as
before
it
proved
fruitless
as
before
even
the
track
by
which
the
enemy
had
retreated
could
not
be
discovered
chapter
sixty
five
dade
massacre
this
melancholy
finale
to
the
festivities
of
christmas
was
if
possible
rendered
more
sad
by
a
rumour
that
shortly
after
reached
fort
king
it
was
the
rumour
of
an
event
which
has
since
become
popularly
known
as
dade
massacre
the
report
was
brought
by
an
indian
runner
belonging
to
one
of
the
friendly
clans
but
the
statements
made
were
of
so
startling
a
character
that
they
were
at
first
received
with
a
cry
of
incredulity
other
runners
however
continuously
arriving
confirmed
the
account
of
the
first
messenger
until
his
story
tragically
improbable
as
it
appeared
was
accepted
as
truth
it
was
true
in
all
its
romantic
colouring
true
in
all
its
sanguinary
details
the
war
had
commenced
in
real
earnest
inaugurated
by
a
conflict
of
the
most
singular
kind
singular
both
in
character
and
result
an
account
of
this
battle
is
perhaps
of
sufficient
interest
to
be
given
in
the
early
part
of
this
narrative
it
has
been
mentioned
that
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
gave
out
the
vaunt
that
he
could
march
through
all
the
seminole
reserve
with
only
a
corporal
guard
at
his
back
that
officer
was
major
dade
it
was
the
destiny
of
major
dade
to
find
an
opportunity
for
giving
proof
of
his
warlike
prowess
though
with
something
more
than
a
guard
at
his
back
the
result
was
a
sad
contrast
to
the
boast
he
had
so
thoughtlessly
uttered
to
understand
this
enterprise
it
is
necessary
to
say
a
word
topographically
of
the
country
on
the
west
coast
of
the
peninsula
of
florida
is
a
bay
called
tampa
by
the
spaniards
espiritu
santo
at
the
head
of
this
bay
was
erected
fort
brooke
a
stockade
similar
to
fort
king
and
lying
about
ninety
miles
from
the
latter
in
a
southerly
direction
it
was
another
of
those
military
posts
established
in
connection
with
the
indian
reserve
a
depot
for
troops
and
stores
also
an
entrepot
for
such
as
might
arrive
from
the
ports
of
the
mexican
gulf
about
two
hundred
soldiers
were
stationed
here
at
the
breaking
out
of
hostilities
they
were
chiefly
artillery
with
a
small
detachment
of
infantry
shortly
after
the
fruitless
council
at
fort
king
these
troops
or
as
many
of
them
as
could
be
spared
were
ordered
by
general
clinch
to
proceed
to
the
latter
place
and
unite
with
the
main
body
of
the
army
in
obedience
to
these
orders
one
hundred
men
with
their
quota
of
officers
were
set
in
motion
for
fort
king
major
dade
commanded
the
detachment
on
the
eve
of
christmas
they
had
taken
the
route
marching
out
from
fort
brooke
in
high
spirits
buoyant
with
the
hope
of
encountering
and
winning
laurels
in
a
fight
with
the
indian
foe
they
flattered
themselves
that
it
would
be
the
first
conflict
of
the
war
and
therefore
that
in
which
the
greatest
reputation
would
be
gained
by
the
victors
they
dreamt
not
of
defeat
with
flags
flying
gaily
drums
rolling
merrily
bugles
sounding
the
advance
cannon
pealing
their
farewell
salute
and
comrades
cheering
them
onwards
the
detachment
commenced
its
march
that
fatal
march
from
which
it
was
destined
never
to
return
just
seven
days
after
on
the
of
december
a
man
made
his
appearance
at
the
gates
of
fort
brooke
crawling
upon
his
hands
and
knees
in
his
tattered
attire
could
scarcely
be
recognised
the
uniform
of
a
soldier
a
private
of
dade
detachment
for
such
he
was
his
clothes
were
saturated
with
water
from
the
creeks
and
soiled
with
mud
from
the
swamps
they
were
covered
with
dust
and
stained
with
blood
his
body
was
wounded
in
five
places
severe
wounds
all
one
in
the
right
shoulder
one
in
the
right
thigh
one
near
the
temple
one
in
the
left
arm
and
another
in
the
back
he
was
wan
wasted
emaciated
to
the
condition
of
a
skeleton
and
presented
the
aspect
of
one
when
in
a
weak
trembling
voice
he
announced
himself
as
private
clark
of
the
artillery
his
old
comrades
had
with
difficulty
identified
him
shortly
after
two
others
privates
sprague
and
thomas
made
their
appearance
in
a
similar
plight
their
report
was
similar
to
that
already
delivered
by
clark
that
major
dade
command
had
been
attacked
by
the
indians
cut
to
pieces
massacred
to
a
man
that
they
themselves
were
the
sole
survivors
of
that
band
who
had
so
lately
gone
forth
from
the
fort
in
all
the
pride
of
confident
strength
and
the
hopeful
anticipation
of
glory
and
their
story
was
true
to
the
letter
of
all
the
detachment
these
three
miserable
remnants
of
humanity
alone
escaped
the
others
one
hundred
and
six
in
all
had
met
death
on
the
banks
of
the
amazura
instead
of
the
laurel
they
had
found
the
cypress
the
three
who
escaped
had
been
struck
down
and
left
for
dead
upon
the
field
it
was
only
by
counterfeiting
death
they
had
succeeded
in
afterwards
crawling
from
the
ground
and
making
their
way
back
to
the
fort
most
of
this
journey
clark
performed
upon
his
hands
and
knees
proceeding
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
to
the
hour
over
a
distance
of
more
than
sixty
miles
chapter
sixty
six
the
the
affair
of
dade
massacre
is
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
indian
warfare
no
conflict
of
a
similar
kind
had
ever
occurred
at
least
none
so
fatal
to
the
whites
engaged
in
it
in
this
case
they
suffered
complete
annihilation
for
of
the
three
wounded
men
who
had
escaped
two
of
them
shortly
after
died
of
their
wounds
nor
had
the
indians
any
great
advantage
over
their
antagonists
beyond
that
of
superior
cunning
and
strategy
it
was
near
the
banks
of
the
amazura
ouithlacoochee
of
the
seminoles
and
after
crossing
that
stream
that
major
dade
party
had
been
attacked
the
assault
was
made
in
ground
comparatively
open
a
tract
of
where
the
trees
grew
thin
and
straggling
so
that
the
indians
had
in
reality
no
great
advantage
either
from
position
or
intrenchment
neither
has
it
been
proved
that
they
were
greatly
superior
in
numbers
to
the
troops
they
destroyed
not
more
than
two
to
one
and
this
proportion
in
most
indian
wars
has
been
considered
by
their
white
antagonists
as
only
fair
odds
many
of
the
indians
appeared
upon
the
ground
mounted
but
these
remained
at
a
distance
from
the
fire
of
the
musketry
and
only
those
on
foot
took
part
in
the
action
indeed
their
conquest
was
so
soon
completed
that
the
horsemen
were
not
needed
the
first
fire
was
so
deadly
that
followers
were
driven
into
utter
confusion
they
were
unable
to
retreat
the
mounted
indians
had
already
outflanked
them
and
cut
off
their
chance
of
escape
dade
himself
with
most
of
his
officers
fell
at
the
first
volley
and
the
survivors
had
no
choice
but
fight
it
out
on
the
ground
a
breastwork
was
attempted
by
felling
trees
and
throwing
their
trunks
into
a
triangle
but
the
hot
fire
from
the
indian
rifles
soon
checked
the
progress
of
the
work
and
the
parapet
never
rose
even
above
the
ground
into
this
insecure
shelter
the
survivors
of
the
first
attack
retreated
and
there
fell
rapidly
under
the
missiles
of
their
foes
in
a
short
while
the
last
man
lay
motionless
and
the
slaughter
was
at
an
end
when
the
place
was
afterwards
visited
by
our
troops
this
triangular
inclosure
was
found
filled
with
dead
bodies
piled
upon
one
another
just
as
they
had
fallen
crosswise
lengthways
in
every
attitude
of
death
it
was
afterwards
noised
abroad
that
the
indians
had
inhumanly
tortured
the
wounded
and
horribly
mutilated
the
slain
this
was
not
true
there
were
no
wounded
left
to
be
tortured
except
the
three
who
escaped
and
as
for
the
mutilation
but
one
or
two
instances
of
this
occurred
since
known
to
have
been
the
work
of
runaway
negroes
actuated
by
motives
of
personal
revenge
some
scalps
were
taken
but
this
is
the
custom
of
indian
warfare
and
white
men
ere
now
have
practised
the
fashion
while
under
the
frenzied
excitement
of
battle
i
was
one
of
those
who
afterwards
visited
the
on
a
tour
of
inspection
ordered
by
the
and
the
official
report
of
that
tour
is
the
best
testimony
as
to
the
behaviour
of
the
victors
it
reads
as
follows
major
dade
and
his
party
were
destroyed
on
the
morning
of
the
of
december
about
four
miles
from
their
camp
of
the
preceding
night
they
were
advancing
in
column
of
route
when
they
were
attacked
by
the
enemy
who
rose
in
a
swarm
out
of
the
cover
of
long
grass
and
palmettoes
the
indians
suddenly
appeared
close
to
their
files
muskets
were
clubbed
knives
and
bayonets
used
and
parties
clenched
in
deadly
conflict
in
the
second
attack
our
own
men
muskets
taken
from
the
dead
and
wounded
were
used
against
them
a
cut
down
a
succession
of
artillerists
when
the
cannon
were
taken
the
carriages
broken
and
burned
and
the
guns
rolled
into
a
pond
many
negroes
were
in
the
field
but
no
scalps
were
taken
by
the
indians
on
the
other
hand
the
negroes
with
hellish
cruelty
pierced
the
throats
of
all
whose
cries
or
groans
shewed
that
there
was
still
life
in
them
another
official
report
runs
thus
we
approached
the
from
the
rear
our
advanced
guard
had
passed
the
ground
without
halting
when
the
commanding
officer
and
his
staff
came
upon
one
of
the
most
appalling
scenes
that
can
be
imagined
we
first
saw
some
broken
and
scattered
boxes
then
a
cart
the
two
oxen
of
which
were
lying
dead
as
if
they
had
fallen
asleep
their
yokes
still
on
them
a
little
to
the
right
one
or
two
horses
were
seen
we
next
came
to
a
small
inclosure
made
by
felling
trees
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
a
triangular
breastwork
within
the
triangle
along
the
north
and
west
faces
of
it
were
about
thirty
bodies
mostly
mere
skeletons
although
much
of
the
clothing
was
left
upon
them
they
were
lying
in
the
positions
they
must
have
occupied
during
the
fight
some
had
fallen
over
their
dead
comrades
but
most
of
them
lay
close
to
the
logs
with
their
heads
turned
towards
the
breastwork
over
which
they
had
delivered
their
fire
and
their
bodies
stretched
with
striking
regularity
parallel
to
each
other
they
had
evidently
been
shot
dead
at
their
posts
and
the
indians
had
not
disturbed
them
except
by
taking
the
scalps
of
some
which
it
is
said
was
done
by
their
negro
allies
the
officers
were
all
easily
recognised
some
still
wore
their
rings
and
breastpins
and
money
was
found
in
their
pockets
the
bodies
of
eight
officers
and
men
were
interred
it
may
be
proper
to
observe
that
the
attack
was
not
made
from
a
hommock
but
in
a
country
the
indians
being
concealed
by
palmettoes
and
grass
from
this
report
it
appears
that
the
indians
were
fighting
not
for
plunder
not
even
from
motives
of
diabolical
revenge
their
motive
was
higher
and
purer
it
was
the
defence
of
their
country
of
their
hearths
and
homes
the
advantage
they
had
over
the
troop
of
major
dade
was
simply
that
of
ambush
and
surprise
this
officer
though
a
man
of
undoubted
gallantry
was
entirely
wanting
in
those
qualities
necessary
to
a
leader
especially
one
engaged
against
such
a
foe
he
was
a
mere
as
most
officers
are
lacking
the
genius
which
enables
the
great
military
chieftain
to
adapt
himself
to
the
circumstances
that
surround
him
he
conducted
the
march
of
his
detachment
as
if
going
upon
parade
and
by
so
doing
he
carried
it
into
danger
and
subsequent
destruction
but
if
the
commander
of
the
whites
in
this
fatal
affair
was
lacking
in
military
capacity
the
leader
of
the
indians
was
not
it
soon
became
known
that
he
who
planned
the
ambush
and
conducted
it
to
such
a
sanguinary
and
successful
issue
was
the
young
chief
of
the
baton
rouge
osceola
he
could
not
have
stayed
long
upon
the
ground
to
enjoy
his
triumph
it
was
upon
that
same
evening
at
fort
king
forty
miles
distant
from
the
scene
of
dade
massacre
that
the
commissioner
fell
before
his
vow
of
vengeance
chapter
sixty
seven
the
battle
of
ouithlacoochee
the
murder
of
the
commissioner
called
for
some
act
of
prompt
retribution
immediately
after
its
occurrence
several
expresses
had
been
dispatched
by
different
routes
to
camp
drane
some
of
whom
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
while
the
rest
arrived
safely
with
the
news
by
daybreak
of
the
following
morning
the
army
more
than
a
thousand
strong
was
in
motion
and
marching
towards
the
amazura
the
avowed
object
of
this
expedition
was
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
of
the
hostile
indians
their
fathers
and
mothers
their
wives
sisters
and
children
whose
amidst
the
fastnesses
of
the
great
swamp
the
cove
had
become
known
to
the
general
it
was
intended
they
should
be
if
and
held
as
hostages
until
the
warriors
could
be
induced
to
surrender
with
all
others
who
could
be
spared
from
the
fort
i
was
ordered
to
accompany
the
expedition
and
accordingly
joined
it
upon
the
march
from
the
talk
i
heard
around
me
i
soon
discovered
the
sentiment
of
the
soldiery
they
had
but
little
thought
of
making
captives
exasperated
by
what
had
taken
place
at
the
fort
further
exasperated
by
what
they
called
dade
massacre
i
felt
satisfied
that
they
would
not
stay
to
take
prisoners
old
men
or
young
men
women
or
children
all
would
alike
be
slain
no
quarter
would
be
given
i
was
sick
even
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
wholesale
carnage
as
was
anticipated
anticipated
i
say
for
all
confidently
believed
it
would
take
place
the
of
these
unfortunate
families
had
become
known
there
were
guides
conducting
us
thither
who
knew
the
very
spot
how
could
we
fail
to
reach
it
an
easy
surprise
was
expected
information
had
been
received
that
the
warriors
or
most
of
them
were
absent
upon
another
and
more
distant
expedition
and
in
a
quarter
where
we
could
not
possibly
encounter
them
we
were
to
make
a
descent
upon
the
nest
in
the
absence
of
the
eagles
and
with
this
intent
the
army
was
conducted
by
silent
and
secret
marches
but
the
day
before
our
expedition
would
have
appeared
easy
enough
a
mere
exciting
frolic
without
peril
of
any
kind
but
the
news
of
defeat
had
produced
a
magical
effect
upon
the
spirits
of
the
soldiers
and
whilst
it
exasperated
it
had
also
cowed
them
for
the
first
time
they
began
to
feel
something
like
a
respect
for
their
foe
mingled
perhaps
with
a
little
dread
of
him
the
indians
at
least
knew
how
to
kill
this
feeling
increased
as
fresh
messengers
came
in
from
the
scene
of
dade
conflict
bringing
new
details
of
that
sanguinary
affair
it
was
not
without
some
apprehension
then
that
the
soldier
marched
onwards
advancing
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
country
and
even
the
reckless
volunteer
kept
close
in
the
ranks
as
he
rode
silently
along
about
we
reached
the
banks
of
the
amazura
the
stream
had
to
be
crossed
before
the
cove
could
be
reached
for
the
vast
network
of
swamps
and
lagoons
bearing
this
name
extended
from
the
opposite
side
a
ford
had
been
promised
the
general
but
the
guides
were
at
fault
no
could
be
found
at
the
point
where
we
reached
it
the
river
ran
past
broad
black
and
deep
too
deep
to
be
waded
even
by
our
horses
were
the
guides
playing
traitor
and
misleading
us
it
certainly
began
to
assume
that
appearance
but
no
it
could
not
be
they
were
indians
it
is
true
but
well
proved
in
their
devotion
to
the
whites
besides
they
were
men
compromised
with
the
national
party
doomed
to
death
by
their
own
people
our
defeat
would
have
been
their
ruin
it
was
not
treason
as
shewn
afterwards
they
had
simply
been
deceived
by
the
trails
and
had
gone
the
wrong
way
it
was
fortunate
for
us
they
had
done
so
but
for
this
mistake
of
the
guides
the
army
of
general
clinch
might
have
been
called
upon
to
repeat
on
a
larger
scale
the
drama
so
lately
enacted
by
dade
and
his
companions
had
we
reached
the
true
crossing
some
two
miles
further
down
we
should
have
entered
an
ambush
of
the
enemy
skillfully
arranged
by
that
same
leader
who
so
well
understood
his
forest
tactics
the
report
of
the
warriors
having
gone
on
a
distant
expedition
was
a
mere
the
prelude
to
a
series
of
strategic
manoeuvres
devised
by
osceola
the
indians
were
at
that
moment
where
we
should
have
been
but
for
the
mistake
of
the
guides
the
ford
was
beset
upon
both
sides
by
the
foe
the
warriors
lying
unseen
like
snakes
among
the
grass
ready
to
spring
forth
the
moment
we
should
attempt
the
crossing
fortunate
it
was
for
clinch
and
his
army
that
our
guides
possessed
so
little
skill
the
general
acted
without
this
knowledge
at
the
time
else
had
he
known
the
dangerous
proximity
his
behaviour
might
have
been
different
as
it
was
a
halt
was
ordered
and
after
some
deliberation
it
was
determined
we
should
cross
the
river
at
the
point
where
the
army
had
arrived
some
old
boats
were
found
scows
with
a
number
of
indian
canoes
these
would
facilitate
the
transport
of
the
infantry
while
the
mounted
men
could
swim
over
upon
their
horses
rafts
of
logs
were
soon
knocked
together
and
the
passage
of
the
stream
commenced
the
manoeuvre
was
executed
with
considerable
adroitness
and
in
less
than
an
hour
one
half
of
the
command
had
crossed
i
was
among
those
who
got
first
over
but
i
scarcely
congratulated
myself
on
the
success
of
the
enterprise
i
felt
sad
at
the
prospect
of
being
soon
called
upon
to
aid
in
the
slaughter
of
defenceless
people
of
women
and
children
for
around
me
there
was
no
other
anticipation
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
positive
relief
almost
of
joy
that
i
heard
that
wild
breaking
through
the
woods
the
of
the
seminoles
along
with
it
came
the
ringing
detonations
of
rifles
the
louder
report
of
musketry
while
bullets
whistling
through
the
air
and
breaking
branches
from
the
surrounding
trees
told
us
that
we
were
assailed
in
earnest
and
by
a
large
force
of
the
enemy
that
portion
of
the
army
already
over
had
observed
the
precaution
to
post
itself
in
a
strong
position
among
heavy
timber
that
grew
near
the
and
on
this
account
the
first
volley
of
the
indians
produced
a
less
deadly
effect
for
all
that
several
fell
and
those
who
were
exposed
to
view
were
still
in
danger
the
fire
was
returned
by
the
troops
repeated
by
the
indians
and
again
answered
by
the
soldiers
now
rolling
continuously
now
in
straggling
volleys
or
single
shots
and
at
intervals
altogether
ceasing
for
a
long
while
but
little
damage
was
done
on
either
side
but
it
was
evident
that
the
indians
under
cover
of
the
underwood
were
working
themselves
into
a
more
advantageous
position
in
fact
us
the
troops
on
the
other
hand
dare
not
stir
from
the
spot
where
they
had
landed
until
a
larger
number
should
cross
over
after
that
it
was
intended
we
should
advance
and
force
the
indians
from
the
covert
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
the
troops
from
the
other
side
continued
to
cross
hitherto
they
had
been
protected
by
the
fire
of
those
already
over
but
at
this
crisis
a
manoeuvre
was
effected
by
the
indians
that
threatened
to
put
an
end
to
the
passing
of
the
river
unless
under
a
destructive
fire
from
their
rifles
just
below
our
position
a
narrow
strip
of
land
jutted
out
into
the
stream
forming
a
miniature
peninsula
it
was
a
caused
by
an
eddy
on
the
opposite
side
it
was
lower
than
the
main
bank
and
bare
of
timber
except
at
its
extreme
point
where
a
sort
of
island
had
been
formed
higher
than
the
peninsula
itself
on
this
island
grew
a
thick
grove
of
evergreen
trees
palms
and
magnolias
in
short
a
hommock
it
would
have
been
prudent
for
us
to
have
occupied
this
hommock
at
the
moment
of
our
first
crossing
over
but
our
general
had
not
perceived
the
advantage
the
indians
were
not
slow
in
noticing
it
and
before
we
could
take
any
steps
to
hinder
them
a
body
of
warriors
rushed
across
the
isthmus
and
took
possession
of
the
hommock
the
result
of
this
skillful
manoeuvre
was
soon
made
manifest
the
boats
in
crossing
were
swept
down
by
the
current
within
range
of
the
wooded
islet
out
of
whose
evergreen
shades
was
now
poured
a
continuous
stream
of
blue
fiery
smoke
while
the
leaden
missiles
did
their
work
of
death
men
were
seen
dropping
down
upon
the
rafts
or
tumbling
over
the
sides
of
the
canoes
with
a
heavy
plunge
upon
the
water
that
told
they
had
ceased
to
live
while
the
thick
fire
of
musketry
that
was
directed
upon
the
hommock
altogether
failed
to
dislodge
the
daring
band
who
occupied
it
there
were
but
few
of
them
for
we
had
seen
them
distinctly
as
they
ran
over
the
isthmus
but
it
was
evident
they
were
a
chosen
few
skilled
marksmen
every
man
they
were
dealing
destruction
at
every
shot
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
excitement
elsewhere
the
conflict
was
carried
on
with
more
equality
since
both
parties
fought
under
cover
of
the
trees
and
but
little
injury
was
sustained
or
inflicted
by
either
the
band
upon
the
islet
were
killing
more
of
our
men
than
all
the
rest
of
the
enemy
there
was
no
other
resource
than
to
dislodge
them
from
the
hommock
to
drive
them
forth
at
the
bayonet
point
at
least
this
was
the
design
that
now
suggested
itself
to
the
it
seemed
a
forlorn
hope
whoever
should
approach
from
the
would
receive
the
full
fire
of
the
concealed
enemy
be
compelled
to
advance
under
a
fearful
risk
of
life
to
my
surprise
the
duty
was
assigned
to
myself
why
i
know
not
since
it
could
not
be
from
any
superior
courage
or
ardour
i
had
hitherto
evinced
in
the
campaign
but
the
order
came
from
the
general
direct
and
prompt
and
with
no
great
spirit
i
prepared
to
execute
it
with
a
party
of
rifles
scarcely
outnumbering
the
enemy
we
were
to
attack
at
such
a
serious
disadvantage
i
started
forth
for
the
peninsula
i
felt
as
if
marching
upon
my
death
and
i
believe
that
most
of
those
who
followed
me
were
the
victims
of
a
similar
presentiment
even
though
it
had
been
a
certainty
we
could
not
now
turn
back
the
eyes
of
the
whole
army
were
upon
us
we
must
go
forwards
we
must
conquer
or
fall
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
upon
the
island
and
advancing
by
rapid
strides
towards
the
hommock
we
had
hopes
that
the
indians
might
not
have
perceived
our
approach
and
that
we
should
get
behind
them
unawares
they
were
vain
hopes
our
enemies
had
been
watchful
they
had
observed
our
manoeuvre
from
its
beginning
had
faced
round
and
were
waiting
with
rifles
loaded
ready
to
receive
us
but
half
conscious
of
our
perilous
position
we
pressed
forwards
and
had
got
within
twenty
yards
of
the
grove
when
the
blue
smoke
and
red
flame
suddenly
jetted
forth
from
the
trees
i
heard
the
bullets
shower
past
my
ears
i
heard
the
cries
and
groans
of
my
followers
as
they
fell
thickly
behind
me
i
looked
around
i
saw
that
every
one
of
them
was
stretched
upon
the
ground
dead
or
dying
at
the
same
instant
a
voice
reached
me
from
the
grove

symbol
upon

your

is

with

chapter
sixty
eight
a
victory
ending
in
a
retreat
i
saw
not
the
speaker
who
was
completely
hidden
behind
the
thick
trellis
of
leaves
it
was
not
necessary
i
should
see
him
to
know
who
addressed
me
on
hearing
the
voice
i
instantly
recognised
it
it
was
osceola
who
spoke
i
can
not
describe
my
sensations
at
that
moment
nor
tell
exactly
how
i
acted
my
mind
was
in
a
chaos
of
confusion
surprise
and
fear
mingling
alike
in
my
emotions
i
remember
facing
once
more
towards
my
followers
i
saw
that
they
were
not
all
dead
some
were
still
lying
where
they
had
fallen
doubled
up
or
stretched
out
in
various
attitudes
of
death
motionless
beyond
doubt
lifeless
some
still
moved
their
cries
for
help
showing
that
life
was
not
extinct
to
my
joy
i
observed
several
who
had
regained
their
feet
and
were
running
or
rather
scrambling
rapidly
away
from
the
ground
and
still
another
few
who
had
risen
into
attitudes
and
were
crawling
off
upon
their
hands
and
knees
these
last
were
still
being
fired
upon
from
the
bushes
and
as
i
stood
wavering
i
saw
one
or
two
of
them
levelled
along
the
grass
by
the
fatal
bullets
that
rained
thickly
around
me
among
the
wounded
who
lay
at
my
feet
there
was
a
young
fellow
whom
i
knew
he
appeared
to
be
shot
through
both
limbs
and
could
not
move
his
body
from
the
spot
his
appeal
to
me
for
help
was
the
first
thing
that
aroused
me
from
my
indecision
i
remembered
that
this
young
man
had
once
done
me
a
service
almost
mechanically
i
bent
down
grasped
him
around
the
waist
and
raising
his
body
commenced
dragging
him
away
with
my
burden
i
hurried
back
across
the
isthmus
as
fast
as
my
strength
would
permit
nor
did
i
stop
till
beyond
the
range
of
the
indian
rifles
here
i
was
met
by
a
party
of
soldiers
sent
to
cover
our
retreat
in
their
hands
i
left
my
disabled
comrade
and
hastened
onward
to
deliver
my
melancholy
report
to
the
my
tale
needed
no
telling
our
movement
had
been
watched
and
our
discomfiture
was
already
known
throughout
the
whole
army
the
general
said
not
a
word
and
without
giving
time
for
explanation
ordered
me
to
another
part
of
the
field
all
blamed
his
imprudence
in
having
ordered
such
a
desperate
charge
especially
with
so
small
a
force
for
myself
i
had
gained
the
credit
of
a
bold
leader
but
how
i
chanced
to
be
the
only
one
who
came
back
unscathed
out
of
that
deadly
fire
was
a
puzzle
which
at
that
moment
i
did
not
choose
to
explain
for
an
hour
or
more
the
fight
continued
to
be
carried
on
in
the
shape
of
a
confused
skirmish
among
swamps
and
trees
without
either
party
gaining
any
material
advantage
each
held
the
position
it
had
taken
up
though
the
indians
retained
the
freedom
of
the
forest
beyond
to
have
retired
from
ours
would
have
been
the
ruin
of
the
whole
army
since
there
was
no
other
mode
of
retreat
but
by
recrossing
the
stream
and
that
could
only
have
been
effected
under
the
fire
of
the
enemy
and
yet
to
hold
our
position
appeared
equally
ruinous
we
could
effect
nothing
by
being
thus
brought
to
a
for
we
were
actually
besieged
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
we
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
force
the
indians
from
the
bush
having
once
failed
a
second
attempt
to
cut
our
way
through
them
would
be
a
still
more
perilous
emprise
and
yet
to
remain
stationary
had
also
its
prospects
of
danger
with
scanty
provisions
the
troops
had
marched
out
of
their
cantonments
their
rations
were
already
exhausted
hunger
stared
the
army
in
the
face
its
pangs
were
already
felt
and
every
hour
would
render
them
more
severe
we
began
to
believe
that
we
were
and
such
was
virtually
the
fact
around
us
in
a
swarmed
the
savages
each
behind
his
protecting
tree
thus
forming
a
defensive
line
equal
in
strength
to
a
fortified
intrenchment
such
could
not
be
forced
without
the
certainty
of
great
slaughter
among
our
men
we
perceived
too
that
the
number
of
our
enemies
was
hourly
increasing
a
peculiar
cry
which
some
of
the
old
indian
fighters
understood
heard
at
intervals
betokened
the
arrival
of
fresh
parties
of
the
foe
we
felt
the
apprehension
that
we
were
being
outnumbered
and
might
soon
be
overpowered
a
gloomy
feeling
was
fast
spreading
itself
through
the
ranks
during
the
skirmishes
that
had
already
occurred
we
noticed
that
many
of
the
indians
were
armed
with
fusils
and
muskets
a
few
were
observed
in
uniform
with
military
accoutrements
one
a
conspicuous
leader
was
still
more
singularly
attired
from
his
shoulders
was
suspended
a
large
silken
flag
after
the
fashion
of
a
spanish
cloak
of
the
times
of
the
its
stripes
of
alternate
red
and
white
with
the
blue
starry
field
at
the
corner
were
conspicuous
every
eye
in
the
army
looked
upon
it
and
recognised
in
the
fantastic
draping
thus
tauntingly
displayed
the
loved
flag
of
our
country
these
symbols
were
expressive
they
did
not
puzzle
us
their
presence
among
our
enemies
was
easily
explained
the
flag
the
muskets
and
fusils
the
uniforms
and
equipments
were
trophies
from
the
where
dade
had
fallen
though
the
troops
regarded
these
objects
with
bitter
indignation
their
anger
was
impotent
the
hour
for
avenging
the
disastrous
fate
of
their
comrades
had
not
yet
arrived
it
is
not
improbable
we
might
have
shared
their
destiny
had
we
remained
much
longer
upon
the
ground
but
a
plan
of
retreat
offered
of
which
our
general
was
not
loath
to
take
advantage
it
was
the
happy
idea
of
a
volunteer
officer
an
old
campaigner
of
the
hickory
wars
versed
in
the
tactics
of
indian
fighting
by
his
advice
a
feint
was
made
by
the
troops
who
had
not
yet
crossed
the
volunteers
it
was
a
pretended
attempt
to
effect
the
passage
of
the
river
at
a
point
higher
up
stream
it
was
good
strategy
had
such
a
passage
been
possible
it
would
have
brought
the
enemy
between
two
fires
and
thus
put
an
end
to
the
surround
but
a
crossing
was
not
intended
only
a
ruse
it
had
the
effect
designed
the
indians
were
deceived
by
it
and
rushed
in
a
body
up
the
bank
to
prevent
the
attempt
at
crossing
our
beleaguered
force
took
advantage
of
their
temporary
absence
and
the
regulars
making
an
adroit
use
of
the
time
succeeded
in
getting
back
to
the
safe
side
of
the
river
the
wily
foe
was
too
prudent
to
follow
us
and
thus
ended
the
battle
of
the
ouithlacoochee
in
the
hurried
council
that
was
held
there
was
no
two
opinions
as
to
what
course
of
action
we
should
pursue
the
proposal
to
march
back
to
fort
king
was
received
with
a
wonderful
unanimity
and
with
little
loss
of
time
we
took
the
route
and
arrived
without
farther
molestation
at
the
fort
chapter
sixty
nine
another
after
this
action
a
complete
change
was
observed
in
the
spirit
of
the
army
boasting
was
heard
no
more
and
the
eagerness
of
the
troops
to
be
led
against
the
enemy
was
no
longer
difficult
to
restrain
no
one
expressed
desire
for
a
second
expedition
across
the
ouithlacoochee
and
the
cove
was
to
remain
unexplored
until
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
the
volunteers
were
disheartened
wearied
of
the
campaign
and
not
a
little
cowed
by
the
resistance
they
had
so
unexpectedly
encountered
bold
and
bloody
as
it
was
unlooked
for
the
enemy
hitherto
despised
if
it
had
aroused
by
its
conduct
a
strong
feeling
of
exasperation
and
vengeance
had
also
purchased
the
privilege
of
respect
the
battle
of
the
ouithlacoochee
cost
the
united
states
army
nearly
a
hundred
men
the
seminole
loss
was
believed
to
be
much
greater
though
no
one
could
give
a
better
authority
for
this
belief
than
that
of
a
guess
no
one
had
the
enemy
slain
but
this
was
accounted
for
by
the
assertion
that
during
the
fight
they
carried
their
dead
and
wounded
from
the
how
often
has
this
absurd
allegation
appeared
in
the
dispatches
of
generals
both
victorious
and
defeated
it
is
the
usual
explanation
of
a
found
too
sparsely
strewn
by
the
bodies
of
the
foe
the
very
possibility
of
such
an
operation
argues
either
an
easy
conflict
or
a
strong
attachment
between
comrade
and
comrade
too
strong
indeed
for
human
nature
with
some
fighting
experience
i
can
affirm
that
i
never
saw
a
body
either
of
comrade
or
foeman
moved
from
the
ground
where
he
had
fallen
so
long
as
there
was
a
shot
ringing
upon
the
ear
in
the
battle
of
the
ouithlacoochee
no
doubt
some
of
our
enemies
had
bit
the
dust
but
their
loss
was
much
less
than
that
of
our
own
troops
for
myself
and
i
had
ample
opportunity
for
observation
i
could
not
swear
to
a
single
dead
indian
nor
have
i
met
with
a
comrade
who
could
notwithstanding
this
historians
have
chronicled
the
affair
as
a
grand
victory
and
the
dispatch
of
the
is
still
extant
a
curious
specimen
of
warlike
literature
in
this
document
may
be
found
the
name
of
almost
every
officer
engaged
each
depicted
as
a
peerless
hero
a
rare
monument
of
vanity
and
boasting
to
speak
the
honest
truth
we
had
been
well
whipped
by
the
red
skins
and
the
chagrin
of
the
army
was
only
equalled
by
its
exasperation
clinch
although
esteemed
a
kind
general
the
soldier
friend
as
historians
term
him
was
no
longer
regarded
as
a
great
warrior
his
glory
had
departed
if
osceola
owed
any
spite
he
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
what
he
had
accomplished
without
molesting
the
old
veteran
further
though
still
living
he
was
dead
to
fame
a
fresh
now
made
his
appearance
and
hopes
of
victory
were
again
revived
the
new
general
was
gaines
another
of
the
veterans
produced
by
seniority
of
rank
he
had
not
been
ordered
by
the
government
upon
this
especial
duty
but
florida
being
part
of
his
military
district
had
volunteered
to
take
the
guidance
of
the
war
like
his
predecessor
gaines
expected
to
reap
a
rich
harvest
of
laurels
and
like
the
former
was
he
doomed
to
disappointment
again
it
was
the
cypress
wreath
without
delay
our
army
reinforced
by
fresh
troops
from
louisiana
and
elsewhere
was
put
in
motion
and
once
more
marched
upon
the
cove
we
reached
the
banks
of
the
amazura
but
never
crossed
that
fatal
stream
equally
fatal
to
our
glory
as
our
lives
this
time
indians
almost
upon
the
ground
of
the
former
action
with
the
difference
that
it
was
now
upon
the
nether
bank
of
the
stream
we
were
attacked
by
the
red
warriors
and
after
some
hours
of
sharp
skirmishing
compelled
to
shelter
our
proud
battalions
within
the
protecting
pickets
of
a
stockade
within
this
inclosure
we
were
besieged
for
a
period
of
nine
days
scarcely
daring
to
trust
ourselves
outside
the
wooden
walls
starvation
no
longer
stared
us
in
the
face
it
had
actually
come
upon
us
and
but
for
the
we
had
hitherto
bestrode
with
whose
flesh
we
were
fain
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
our
appetites
one
half
the
army
of
camp
izard
would
have
perished
of
hunger
we
were
saved
from
destruction
by
the
timely
arrival
of
a
large
force
that
had
been
dispatched
to
our
rescue
under
clinch
still
commanding
his
brigade
having
marched
direct
from
fort
king
our
former
general
had
the
good
fortune
to
approach
the
enemy
from
their
rear
and
by
surprising
our
besiegers
disentangled
us
from
our
perilous
situation
the
day
of
our
delivery
was
memorable
by
a
singular
incident
an
armistice
of
a
peculiar
character
early
in
the
morning
while
it
was
yet
dark
a
voice
was
heard
hailing
us
from
a
distance
in
a
loud
ho
there
halloa
it
came
from
the
direction
of
the
enemy
since
we
were
it
could
not
be
otherwise
but
the
peculiar
phraseology
led
to
the
hope
that
clinch
brigade
had
arrived
the
hail
was
repeated
and
answered
but
the
hope
of
a
rescue
vanished
when
the
stentorian
voice
was
recognised
as
that
of
abram
the
black
chief
and
quondam
interpreter
of
the
council
what
do
you
want
was
the
interrogatory
ordered
by
the
a
talk
came
the
curt
reply
for
what
purpose
we
want
to
stop
fighting
the
proposal
was
agreeable
as
unexpected
what
could
it
mean
were
the
indians
starring
like
ourselves
and
tired
of
hostilities
it
was
probable
enough
for
what
other
reason
should
they
desire
to
end
the
war
so
abruptly
they
had
not
yet
been
defeated
but
on
the
contrary
victorious
in
every
action
that
had
been
fought
but
one
other
motive
could
be
thought
of
we
were
every
hour
expecting
the
arrival
of
clinch
brigade
runners
had
reached
the
camp
to
say
that
he
was
near
and
reinforced
by
it
we
should
be
not
only
strong
enough
to
raise
the
siege
but
to
attack
the
indians
with
almost
a
certainty
of
defeating
them
perhaps
they
knew
as
well
as
we
that
clinch
was
advancing
and
were
desirous
of
making
terms
before
his
arrival
the
proposal
for
a
talk
was
thus
accounted
for
by
the
who
was
now
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
his
only
apprehension
was
that
the
enemy
should
retreat
before
clinch
could
get
forward
upon
the
field
an
armistice
would
serve
to
delay
the
indians
upon
the
ground
and
without
hesitation
the
distant
speaker
was
informed
that
the
talk
would
be
welcome
a
meeting
of
from
each
side
was
arranged
the
hour
as
soon
as
it
should
be
light
there
were
to
be
three
of
the
indians
and
three
from
the
camp
a
small
savanna
extended
from
the
stockade
at
several
hundred
distance
it
was
bounded
by
the
woods
as
soon
as
the
day
broke
we
saw
three
men
emerge
from
the
timber
and
advance
into
the
open
ground
they
were
indian
chiefs
in
full
costume
they
were
the
commissioners
all
three
were
recognised
from
the
camp
abram
coa
hajo
and
osceola
outside
they
halted
placing
themselves
side
by
side
in
erect
attitudes
and
facing
the
inclosure
three
officers
two
of
whom
could
speak
the
native
tongue
were
sent
forth
to
meet
them
i
was
one
of
the
deputation
in
a
few
seconds
we
stood
face
to
face
with
the
hostile
chiefs
chapter
seventy
the
talk
before
a
word
was
uttered
all
six
of
us
shook
hands
so
far
as
appearance
went
in
the
most
friendly
manner
osceola
grasped
mine
warmly
as
he
did
so
saying
with
a
peculiar
smile
ah
randolph
friends
sometimes
meet
in
war
as
well
as
in
peace
i
knew
to
what
he
referred
but
could
only
answer
him
with
a
significant
look
of
gratitude
an
orderly
sent
to
us
with
a
message
from
the
general
was
seen
approaching
from
the
camp
at
the
same
instant
an
indian
appeared
coming
out
of
the
timber
and
keeping
pace
with
the
orderly
simultaneously
with
the
latter
arrived
upon
the
ground
the
deputation
was
determined
we
should
not
outnumber
it
as
soon
as
the
orderly
had
whispered
his
message
the
talk
began
abram
was
the
spokesman
on
the
part
of
the
indians
and
delivered
himself
in
his
broken
english
the
others
merely
signified
their
assent
by
a
simple
nod
or
the
affirmation
ho
while
their
negative
was
expressed
by
the
exclamation
cooree
do
you
white
folk
want
to
make
peace
abruptly
demanded
the
negro
upon
what
terms
asked
the
head
of
our
party

said
our
speaker
in
reply
i
fear
these
conditions
will
not
be
accepted
by
the
white
general
nor
our
great
father
the
president
i
am
commissioned
to
say
that
the
can
treat
with
you
on
no
other
conditions
than
those
of
your
absolute
submission
and
under
promise
that
you
will
now
agree
to
the
removal
never
haughtily
exclaimed
coa
hajo
and
osceola
in
one
breath
and
with
a
determined
emphasis
that
proved
they
had
no
intention
of
offering
to
surrender
an
what
for
we
submit
asked
the
black
with
some
show
of
astonishment
we
not
conquered

it
matters

what

observed
the
officer
in
reply
we
are
by
far
stronger
than
you
we
must
conquer
you
in
the
end
again
the
two
chiefs
simultaneously
cried
may
be
white
men
you
make
big
mistake
our
strength
we
not
so
weak
you
tink
for
dam
no
we
show
you
our
strength
as
the
negro
said
this
he
turned
inquiringly
towards
his
comrades
as
if
to
seek
their
assent
to
some
proposition
both
seemed
to
grant
it
with
a
ready
nod
and
osceola
who
now
assumed
the
leadership
of
the
affair
faced
towards
the
forest
at
the
same
time
giving
utterance
to
a
loud
and
peculiar
intonation
the
echoes
of
his
voice
had
not
ceased
to
vibrate
upon
the
air
when
the
evergreen
grove
was
observed
to
be
in
motion
along
its
whole
edge
and
the
next
instant
a
line
of
dusky
warriors
shewed
itself
in
the
open
ground
they
stepped
forth
a
pace
or
two
then
halted
in
perfect
order
of
battle
so
that
their
numbers
could
easily
be
told
off
from
where
we
stood
count
the
red
warriors
cried
osceola
in
a
triumphant
tone
count
them
and
be
no
longer
ignorant
of
the
strength
of
your
enemy
as
the
indian
uttered
these
words
a
satirical
smile
played
upon
his
lips
and
he
stood
for
some
seconds
confronting
us
in
silence
now
continued
he
once
more
pointing
to
his
followers
do
yonder
braves
there
are
fifteen
hundred
of
them
do
they
look
starving
and
submissive
no
they
are
ready
to
continue
the
war
till
the
blood
of
the
last
man
sinks
into
the
soil
of
his
native
land
if
they
must
perish
it
will
be
here
here
in
florida
in
the
land
of
their
birth
upon
the
graves
of
their
fathers
we
have
taken
up
the
rifle
because
you
wronged
us
and
would
drive
us
out
for
the
wrongs
we
have
had
revenge
we
have
killed
many
of
your
people
and
we
are
satisfied
with
the
vengeance
we
have
taken
we
want
to
kill
no
more
but
about
the
removal
we
have
not
changed
our
minds
we
shall
never
change
them
we
have
made
you
a
fair
proposition
accept
it
and
in
this
hour
the
war
shall
cease
reject
it
and
more
blood
shall
be
spilled
ay
by
the
spirit
of
wykome
rivers
of
blood
shall
flow
the
red
poles
of
our
lodges
shall
be
painted
again
and
again
with
the
blood
of
our
foes
peace
or
war
then
you
are
welcome
to
your
choice
as
osceola
ceased
speaking
he
waved
his
hand
towards
his
dusky
warriors
by
the
wood
who
at
the
sign
disappeared
among
the
trees
silently
rapidly
almost
mysteriously
a
meet
reply
was
being
delivered
to
the
passionate
harangue
of
the
young
chief
when
the
speaker
was
interrupted
by
the
report
of
musketry
heard
in
the
direction
of
the
indians
but
further
off
the
shots
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
and
were
accompanied
by
shouts
that
though
feebly
borne
from
the
far
distance
could
be
distinguished
as
the
charging
cheers
of
men
advancing
into
a
battle
ha
foul
play
cried
the
chiefs
in
a
breath
liars
you
shall
rue
this
treason
and
without
waiting
to
exchange
another
sentence
all
three
sprang
off
from
the
spot
and
ran
at
full
speed
towards
the
covert
of
the
woods
we
turned
back
within
the
lines
of
the
camp
where
the
shots
had
also
been
heard
and
interpreted
as
the
advance
of
clinch
brigade
attacking
the
indian
outposts
in
the
rear
we
found
the
troops
already
mustered
in
and
preparing
to
issue
forth
from
the
stockade
in
a
few
minutes
the
order
was
given
and
the
army
marched
forth
extending
itself
rapidly
both
right
and
left
along
the
bank
of
the
river
as
soon
as
the
formation
was
complete
the
line
advanced
the
troops
were
burning
for
revenge
cooped
up
as
they
had
been
for
days
and
more
than
half
disgraced
they
had
now
an
opportunity
to
retrieve
their
honour
and
were
fully
bent
upon
the
punishment
of
the
savage
foe
with
an
army
in
their
rear
rapidly
closing
upon
them
by
an
extended
line
for
this
had
been
between
the
commanders
another
similarly
advancing
upon
their
front
how
could
the
indians
escape
they
must
fight
they
would
be
conquered
at
last
this
was
the
expectation
of
all
officers
and
soldiers
the
was
himself
in
high
spirits
his
strategic
plan
had
succeeded
the
enemy
was
surrounded
entrapped
a
great
victory
was
before
him
a
harvest
of
laurels
we
marched
forward
we
heard
shots
but
now
only
solitary
or
straggling
we
could
not
hear
the
of
the
indians
we
continued
to
advance
the
hommocks
were
carried
by
a
charge
but
in
their
shady
coverts
we
found
no
enemy
surely
they
must
still
be
before
us
between
our
lines
and
those
of
the
approaching
reinforcement
is
it
possible
they
can
have
retreated
escaped
no
yonder
they
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
meadow
just
coming
out
from
the
trees
they
are
advancing
to
give
us
battle
now
for
the
charge
now
ha
those
blue
uniforms
and
white
belts
those
and
sabres
these
are
not
indians
it
is
not
the
enemy
they
are
our
friends
the
soldiers
of
clinch
brigade
fortunate
it
was
that
at
that
moment
there
was
a
mutual
recognition
else
might
we
have
annihilated
one
another
chapter
seventy
one
mysterious
disappearance
of
an
army
the
two
divisions
of
the
army
now
came
together
and
after
a
rapid
council
had
been
held
between
the
commanders
continued
scouring
the
field
in
search
of
our
enemy
hours
were
spent
in
the
search
but
not
an
indian
foe
could
be
found
osceola
had
performed
a
piece
of
strategy
unheard
of
in
the
annals
of
war
he
had
carried
an
army
of
men
from
between
two
others
of
nearly
equal
numbers
who
had
completely
enfiladed
him
without
leaving
a
man
upon
the
ground
ay
without
leaving
a
trace
of
his
retreat
that
host
of
indian
warriors
so
lately
observed
in
full
had
all
at
once
broken
up
into
a
thousand
fragments
and
as
if
by
magic
had
melted
out
of
sight
the
enemy
was
gone
we
knew
not
whither
and
the
disappointed
generals
once
more
marched
their
forces
back
to
fort
king
the
dispersion
as
it
was
termed
of
the
indian
army
was
of
course
chronicled
as
another
victory
it
was
a
victory
however
that
killed
poor
old
gaines
at
least
his
military
fame
and
he
was
only
too
glad
to
retire
from
the
command
he
had
been
so
eager
to
obtain
a
third
general
now
took
the
field
as
an
officer
of
more
notoriety
than
either
of
his
predecessors
scott
a
lucky
wound
received
in
the
old
british
wars
seniority
of
rank
a
good
deal
of
political
buffoonery
but
above
all
a
free
translation
of
the
french
system
of
tactics
with
the
assumption
of
being
their
author
had
kept
general
scott
conspicuously
before
the
american
public
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
note
he
who
could
contrive
such
a
system
of
military
manoeuvring
could
not
be
otherwise
than
a
great
soldier
so
reasoned
his
countrymen
of
course
wonderful
things
were
expected
from
the
new
and
great
deeds
were
promised
he
would
deal
with
the
savages
in
a
different
way
from
that
adopted
by
his
predecessors
he
would
soon
put
an
end
to
the
contemptible
war
there
was
much
rejoicing
at
the
appointment
and
preparations
were
made
for
a
campaign
on
a
far
more
extensive
scale
than
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
either
of
the
chiefs
who
preceded
him
the
army
was
doubled
almost
trebled
the
commissariat
amply
provided
for
before
the
great
general
would
consent
to
set
foot
upon
the
field
he
arrived
at
length
and
the
army
was
put
in
motion
i
am
not
going
to
detail
the
incidents
of
this
campaign
there
were
none
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
chronicled
much
less
of
sufficient
interest
to
be
narrated
it
consisted
simply
of
a
series
of
harassing
marches
conducted
with
all
the
pomp
and
regularity
of
a
parade
review
the
army
was
formed
into
three
divisions
somewhat
bombastically
styled
right
wing
left
wing
and
centre
thus
formed
they
were
to
approach
the
cove
of
the
ouithlacoochee
again
that
fatal
cove
from
three
different
directions
fort
king
fort
brooke
and
the
saint
john
on
arriving
on
the
edge
of
the
great
swamp
each
was
to
fire
as
signals
for
the
others
and
then
all
three
were
to
advance
in
converging
lines
towards
the
heart
of
the
seminole
fastness
the
absurd
manoeuvre
was
carried
out
and
ended
as
might
have
been
expected
in
complete
failure
during
the
march
no
man
saw
the
face
of
a
red
indian
a
few
of
their
camps
were
discovered
but
nothing
more
the
cunning
warriors
had
heard
the
signal
guns
and
well
understood
their
significance
with
such
a
hint
of
the
position
of
their
enemy
they
had
but
little
difficulty
in
making
their
retreat
between
the
wings
perhaps
the
most
singular
if
not
the
most
important
incident
occurring
in
scott
campaign
was
one
which
came
very
near
costing
me
my
life
if
not
worthy
of
being
given
in
detail
it
merits
mention
as
a
curious
case
of
abandonment
while
marching
for
the
cove
with
his
centre
wing
the
idea
occurred
to
our
great
commander
to
leave
behind
him
upon
the
banks
of
the
amazura
what
he
termed
a
post
of
observation
this
consisted
of
a
detachment
of
forty
men
mostly
our
suwanee
volunteers
with
their
proportion
of
officers
myself
among
the
number
we
were
ordered
to
fortify
ourselves
on
the
spot
and
there
until
we
should
be
relieved
from
our
duty
which
was
somewhat
indefinitely
understood
even
by
him
who
was
placed
in
command
of
us
after
giving
these
orders
the
general
at
the
head
of
his
central
wing
marched
off
leaving
us
to
our
fate
our
little
band
was
sensibly
alive
to
the
perilous
position
in
which
we
were
thus
placed
and
we
at
once
set
about
making
the
best
of
it
we
felled
trees
built
a
blockhouse
dug
a
well
and
surrounded
both
with
a
strong
stockade
fortunately
we
were
not
by
the
enemy
for
nearly
a
week
after
the
departure
of
the
army
else
we
should
most
certainly
have
been
destroyed
to
a
man
the
indians
in
all
probability
had
followed
the
centre
wing
and
thus
for
a
time
were
carried
out
of
our
neighbourhood
on
the
sixth
day
however
they
made
their
appearance
and
summoned
us
to
surrender
we
refused
and
fought
them
again
and
again
at
intervals
during
a
period
of
fifty
days
several
of
our
men
were
killed
or
wounded
and
among
the
former
the
gallant
chief
of
our
devoted
band
holloman
who
fell
from
a
shot
fired
through
the
interstices
of
the
stockade
provisions
had
been
left
with
us
to
serve
us
for
they
were
eked
out
to
last
for
seven
for
thirty
days
we
subsisted
upon
raw
corn
and
water
with
a
few
handfuls
of
acorns
which
we
contrived
to
gather
from
the
trees
growing
within
the
inclosure
in
this
way
we
held
out
for
a
period
of
fifty
days
and
still
no
no
army
came
to
relieve
us
during
all
that
gloomy
siege
we
never
heard
word
of
either
no
white
face
ever
showed
itself
to
our
anxious
eyes
that
gazed
constantly
outward
we
believed
ourselves
abandoned
forgotten
and
such
in
reality
was
the
fact
general
scott
in
his
eagerness
to
get
away
from
florida
had
quite
forgotten
to
relieve
the
post
of
observation
and
others
believing
that
we
had
long
since
perished
made
no
effort
to
send
a
rescue
death
from
hunger
stared
us
in
the
face
until
at
length
the
brave
old
hunter
hickman
found
his
way
through
the
lines
of
our
besiegers
and
communicated
our
situation
to
our
friends
at
home
his
tale
produced
a
strong
excitement
and
a
force
was
dispatched
to
our
relief
that
succeeded
in
dispersing
our
enemies
and
setting
us
free
from
our
blockhouse
prison
thus
terminated
scott
campaign
and
with
it
his
command
in
florida
the
whole
affair
was
a
burlesque
and
scott
was
only
saved
from
ridicule
and
the
disgrace
of
a

lucky
accident
that
fell

already
reached
him
to
take
control
of
another
indian
war
the
creek
that
was
just
breaking
out
in

this

the
discomfited

excuse
for
retiring
from

destined
to
prove
to
american
generals
a
land
of
melancholy
remembrances
no
less
than
seven
of
them
were
successively
beaten
at
the
game
of
indian
warfare
by
the
seminoles
and
their
wily
chieftains
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
detail
the
history
of
their
failures
and
mishaps
from
the
disappearance
of

was
myself
no

conducted
me
through
the
more
romantic
of
the

paths
of
petite

of
these
only
am
i
enabled
to
write
adieu
then
to
the
grand
historic
note
scott
whole
career
political
as
well
as
military
had
been
a
series
of
his
campaign
in
mexico
will
not
bear
criticism
the
numerous
blunders
he
there
committed
would
have
led
to
most
fatal
results
had
they
not
been
neutralised
by
the
judgment
of
his
inferior
officers
and
the
indomitable
valour
of
the
soldiery
the
battle
of
moline
del
rey
the
armistice
with
santa
anna
were
military
errors
unworthy
of
a
cadet
fresh
from
college
i
make
bold
to
affirm
that
every
action
was
a
the
result
depending
upon
mere
chance
or
rather
on
the
desperate
bravery
of
the
troops
upon
one
side
and
the
infamous
cowardice
of
those
on
the
other
chapter
seventy
two
the
condition
of
black
jake
we
had
escaped
from
the
blockhouse
in
boats
down
the
river
to
its
mouth
and
by
sea
to
saint
marks
thence
the
volunteers
scattered
to
their
homes
their
term
of
service
having
expired
they
went
as
they
listed
journeying
alone
or
in
straggling
squads
of
three
and
four
together
one
of
these
groups
consisted
of
old
hickman
the
hunter
a
companion
of
like
kidney
myself
and
my
ever
faithful
henchman
jake
was
no
longer
the
black
jake
of
yore
a
sad
change
had
come
over
his
external
aspect
his
stood
prominently
out
while
the
cheeks
themselves
had
fallen
in
his
eyeballs
had
retreated
far
within
their
sockets
and
the
neglected
wool
stood
out
over
his
temples
in
a
thick
frizzled
shock
his
skin
had
lost
its
fine
ebon
polish
and
showed
distinct
traces
of
corrugation
wherever
scratched
by
his
now
elongated
a
whitish
dandruffy
surface
was
exhibited
the
poor
fellow
had
fared
badly
in
the
blockhouse
and
three
weeks
of
positive
famine
had
played
sad
havoc
with
his
outward
man
starvation
however
but
little
affected
his
spirits
throughout
all
he
had
preserved
his
jovial
mood
and
his
light
humour
often
roused
me
from
my
despondency
while
gnawing
the
corn
cob
and
washing
down
the
dry
maize
with
a
gourd
of
cold
water
he
would
indulge
in
rapturous
visions
of
hominy
and
to
be
devoured
whenever
it
should
please
fate
to
let
him
return
to
the
ole
plantayshun
such
delightful
prospects
of
future
enjoyment
enabled
him
the
better
to
endure
the
pinching
present
for
anticipation
has
its
joys
now
that
we
were
free
and
actually
heading
homewards
now
that
his
visions
were
certain
soon
to
become
realities
jake
jovialty
could
no
longer
be
kept
within
bounds
his
tongue
was
constantly
in
motion
his
mouth
ever
open
with
the
double
tier
of
ivories
displayed
in
a
continuous
smile
while
his
skin
seemed
to
be
rapidly
recovering
its
dark
oily
lustre
jake
was
the
soul
of
our
party
as
we
trudged
wearily
along
and
his
gay
jokes
affected
even
the
staid
old
hunters
at
intervals
eliciting
from
both
loud
peals
of
for
myself
i
scarcely
shared
their
mirth
only
now
and
then
when
the
sallies
of
my
follower
proved
irresistible
there
was
a
gloom
over
my
spirit
which
i
could
not
comprehend
it
should
have
been
otherwise
i
should
have
felt
happy
at
the
prospect
of
returning
home
of
once
more
beholding
those
who
were
dear
but
it
was
not
so
it
had
been
so
on
my
first
getting
free
from
our
blockhouse
prison
but
this
was
only
the
natural
reaction
consequent
upon
escape
from
what
appeared
almost
certain
death
my
joy
had
been
it
was
past
and
gone
and
now
that
i
was
nearing
my
native
home
dark
shadows
came
over
my
soul
a
presentiment
was
upon
me
that
all
was
not
well
i
could
in
no
way
account
for
this
feeling
for
i
had
heard
no
evil
tidings
in
truth
i
had
heard
nothing
of
home
or
of
friends
for
a
period
of
nearly
two
months
during
our
long
siege
no
communication
had
ever
reached
us
and
at
saint
marks
we
met
but
slight
news
from
the
settlements
of
the
suwanee
we
were
returning
in
ignorance
of
all
that
had
transpired
there
during
our
absence
if
aught
transpired
worthy
of
being
known
this
ignorance
itself
might
have
produced
uncertainty
doubt
even
apprehension
but
it
was
not
the
sole
cause
of
my
presentiment
its
origin
was
different
perhaps
the
recollection
of
my
abrupt
departure
the
unsettled
state
in
which
i
had
left
the
affairs
of
our
family
the
parting
scene
now
vividly
recalled
remembrances
of
ringgold
reflections
upon
the
wicked
designs
of
this
wily
villain
all
these
may
have
contributed
to
form
the
apprehensions
under
which
i
was
suffering
two
months
was
a
long
period
many
events
could
happen
within
two
months
even
in
the
narrow
circle
of
one
own
family
long
since
it
had
been
reported
that
i
had
perished
at
the
hands
of
the
indian
foe
i
was
believed
to
be
dead
at
home
wherever
i
was
known
and
the
belief
might
have
led
to
ill
results
was
my
sister
still
true
to
her
word
so
emphatically
pronounced
in
that
hour
of
parting
was
i
returning
home
to
find
her
still
my
loved
sister
still
single
and
free
or
had
she
yielded
to
maternal
solicitation
and
become
the
wife
of
the
vile
caitiff
after
all
with
such
conjectures
occupying
my
thoughts
no
wonder
i
was
not
in
a
mood
for
merriment
my
companions
noticed
my
dejection
and
in
their
rude
but
kind
way
rallied
me
as
we
rode
along
they
failed
however
to
make
me
cheerful
like
themselves
i
could
not
cast
the
load
from
my
heart
try
as
i
would
the
presentiment
lay
heavy
upon
me
that
all
was
not
well
alas
alas
the
presentiment
proved
true
no
not
true
but
worse
worse
than
my
worst
apprehensions
worse
even
than
that
i
had
most
feared
the
news
that
awaited
me
was
not
of
marriage
but
of
death
the
death
of
my
mother
and
worse
than
death
horrid
doubt
of
my
sister
fate
before
reaching
home
a
messenger
met
me
one
who
told
an
appalling
tale
the
indians
had
attacked
the
settlement
or
rather
my
own
plantation
for
their
foray
had
gone
no
further
my
poor
mother
had
fallen
under
their
savage
knives
my
uncle
too
and
my
sister
had
been
carried
i
stayed
to
hear
no
more
but
driving
the
spurs
into
my
jaded
horse
galloped
forward
like
one
suddenly
smitten
with
madness
chapter
seventy
three
a
bad
spectacle
my
rate
of
speed
soon
brought
me
within
the
boundaries
of
the
plantation
and
without
pausing
to
breathe
my
horse
i
galloped
on
taking
the
path
that
led
most
directly
to
the
house
it
was
not
the
main
road
but
a
here
and
there
closed
up
with
bars
my
horse
was
a
spirited
animal
and
easily
leaped
over
them
i
met
a
man
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
house
a
white
man
a
neighbour
he
made
motions
as
if
to
speak
no
doubt
of
the
calamity
i
did
not
stop
to
listen
i
had
heard
enough
my
eyes
alone
wanted
satisfaction
i
knew
every
turn
of
the
path
i
knew
the
points
where
i
should
first
come
in
sight
of
the
house
i
reached
it
and
looked
forwards
father
of
mercy
there
was
no
house
to
be
seen
i
reined
up
my
horse
i
strained
my
eyes
over
the
landscape
in
vain
no
house
had
i
taken
the
wrong
road
or
was
i
looking
in
the
wrong
direction
no
no
there
stood
the
giant
that
marked
the
embouchure
of
the
path
there
stretched
the
savanna
beyond
it
the
of
indigo
and
maize
beyond
these
the
dark
of
the
hommock
but
beyond
this
last
there
was
nothing
nothing
i
could
recognise
the
whole
landscape
appeared
to
have
undergone
a
change
the
gay
white
walls
the
green
the
cheerful
aspect
of
home
that
from
that
same
spot
had
so
often
greeted
me
returning
hungry
and
wearied
from
the
hunt
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
the
sheds
the
the
offices
even
the
palings
had
disappeared
from
their
steads
i
beheld
thick
volumes
of
smoke
ascending
to
the
sky
and
rolling
over
the
sun
till
his
disc
was
red
the
heavens
were
frowning
upon
me
from
what
i
had
already
learned
the
spectacle
was
easy
of
comprehension
it
caused
no
new
emotion
either
of
surprise
or
pain
i
was
not
capable
of
suffering
more
again
putting
my
horse
to
his
speed
i
galloped
across
the
fields
towards
the
scene
of
desolation
as
i
neared
the
spot
i
could
perceive
the
forms
of
men
moving
about
through
the
smoke
there
appeared
to
be
fifty
or
a
hundred
of
them
their
motions
did
not
betoken
excitement
only
a
few
were
moving
at
all
and
these
with
a
leisurely
gait
that
told
they
were
not
in
action
the
rest
stood
in
groups
in
lounging
attitudes
evidently
mere
spectators
of
the
conflagration
they
were
making
no
attempt
to
extinguish
the
flames
which
i
now
observed
mingling
with
the
smoke
a
few
were
rushing
to
and
fro
most
of
them
on
horseback
apparently
in
the
endeavour
to
catch
some
horses
and
cattle
that
having
escaped
from
the
burnt
inclosure
were
galloping
over
the
fields
neighing
and
lowing
one
might
have
fancied
that
the
men
around
the
fire
were
those
who
had
caused
it
and
for
a
moment
such
an
idea
was
in
my
mind
the
messenger
had
said
that
the
foray
had
just
taken
place
that
very
morning
at
daybreak
it
was
all
i
had
heard
as
i
hurried
away
it
was
yet
early
scarcely
an
hour
after
sunrise
for
we
had
been
travelling
by
night
to
avoid
the
hot
hours
were
the
savages
still
upon
the
ground
were
those
men
indians
in
the
lurid
light
amidst
the
smoke
chasing
the
cattle
as
if
with
the
intention
of
driving
them
off
the
conjecture
was
probable
enough
but
the
report
said
they
had
gone
away
how
else
could
the
details
have
been
known
the
murder
of
my
mother
the
rape
of
my
poor
sister
with
the
savages
still
upon
the
ground
how
had
these
facts
been
ascertained
perhaps
they
had
gone
and
returned
again
to
collect
the
booty
and
fire
the
buildings
for
an
instant
such
fancies
were
before
my
mind
they
had
no
influence
in
checking
my
speed
i
never
thought
of
tightening
the
rein
my
bridle
arm
was
not
free
with
both
hands
i
was
grasping
the
ready
rifle
vengeance
had
made
me
mad
even
had
i
been
certain
that
the
dark
forms
before
me
were
those
of
the
murderers
i
was
determined
to
dash
forwards
into
their
midst
and
perish
upon
the
body
of
a
savage
i
was
not
alone
the
black
was
at
my
heels
and
close
behind
i
could
hear
the
clattering
hoofs
of
the
hunters
horses
we
galloped
up
to
the
selvidge
of
the
smoke
the
deception
was
at
an
end
they
were
not
indians
or
enemies
but
friends
who
stood
around
and
who
hailed
our
approach
neither
with
words
nor
shouts
but
with
the
ominous
silence
of
sympathy
i
pulled
up
by
the
fire
and
dismounted
from
my
horse
men
gathered
around
me
with
looks
of
deep
meaning
they
were
speechless
no
one
uttered
a
word
all
saw
that
it
was
a
tale
that
needed
no
telling
i
was
myself
the
first
to
speak
in
a
voice
so
husky
as
scarcely
to
be
heard
i
inquired
where
the
interrogatory
was
understood
it
was
anticipated
one
had
already
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
was
leading
me
gently
around
the
fire
he
said
nothing
but
pointed
towards
the
hommock
unresistingly
i
walked
by
his
side
as
we
neared
the
pond
i
observed
a
larger
group
than
any
i
had
yet
seen
they
were
standing
in
a
ring
with
their
faces
turned
inwards
and
their
eyes
bent
upon
the
earth
knew
she
was
at
our
approach
the
men
looked
up
and
suddenly
the
ring
opened
both
sides
mechanically
drawing
back
he
who
had
my
hand
conducted
me
silently
onwards
till
i
stood
in
their
midst
i
looked
upon
the
corpse
of
my
mother
beside
it
was
the
dead
body
of
my
uncle
and
beyond
the
bodies
of
several
black
men
faithful
slaves
who
had
fallen
in
defence
of
their
master
and
mistress
my
poor
mother
shot
stabbed
even
in
death
had
she
been
defeatured
though
i
had
anticipated
it
the
spectacle
shocked
me
my
poor
mother
those
glassy
eyes
would
never
smile
upon
me
again
those
pale
lips
would
neither
chide
nor
cheer
me
more
i
could
control
my
emotions
no
longer
i
burst
into
tears
and
falling
upon
the
earth
flung
my
arms
around
the
corpse
and
kissed
the
cold
mute
lips
of
her
who
had
given
me
birth
chapter
seventy
four
to
the
trail
my
grief
was
profound
even
to
misery
the
remembrance
of
occasional
moments
of
coldness
on
the
part
of
my
mother
the
remembrance
more
especially
of
the
last
parting
scene
rendered
my
anguish
acute
had
we
but
parted
in
affection
in
the
friendly
confidence
of
former
years
my
loss
would
have
been
easier
to
endure
but
no
her
last
words
to
me
were
spoken
in
reproach
almost
in
anger
and
it
was
the
memory
of
these
that
now
so
keenly
embittered
my
thoughts
i
would
have
given
the
world
could
she
have
heard
but
one
word
to
know
how
freely
i
forgave
her
my
poor
mother
all
was
forgiven
her
faults
were
few
and
venial
i
remembered
them
not
ambition
was
her
only
sin
among
those
of
her
station
almost
universal
but
i
remembered
it
no
more
i
remembered
only
her
many
virtues
only
that
she
was
my
never
until
that
moment
had
i
known
how
dearly
i
loved
her
it
was
no
time
to
indulge
in
grief
where
was
my
sister
i
sprang
to
my
feet
as
i
gave
wild
utterance
to
the
interrogatory
it
was
answered
only
by
signs
those
around
me
pointed
to
the
forest
i
understood
the
signs
the
savages
had
borne
her
away
up
to
this
hour
i
had
felt
no
hostility
towards
the
red
men
on
the
contrary
my
sentiments
had
an
opposite
inclination
if
not
friendship
for
them
i
had
felt
something
akin
to
it
i
was
conscious
of
the
many
wrongs
they
had
endured
and
were
now
enduring
at
the
hands
of
our
people
i
knew
that
in
the
end
they
would
be
conquered
and
must
submit
i
had
felt
sympathy
for
their
unfortunate
condition
it
was
gone
the
sight
of
my
murdered
mother
produced
an
instantaneous
change
in
my
feelings
and
sympathy
for
the
savage
was
supplanted
by
fierce
hostility
her
blood
called
aloud
for
vengeance
and
my
heart
was
eager
to
obey
the
summons
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
i
registered
vows
of
revenge
i
stood
not
alone
old
hickman
and
his
were
at
my
back
and
fifty
others
joined
their
voices
in
a
promise
to
aid
me
in
the
pursuit
black
jake
was
among
the
loudest
who
clamoured
for
retribution
he
too
had
sustained
his
loss
viola
was
nowhere
to
be
found
she
had
been
carried
off
with
the
other
domestics
some
may
have
gone
voluntarily
but
all
were
absent
all
who
were
not
dead
the
plantation
and
its
people
had
no
longer
an
existence
i
was
homeless
as
well
as
motherless
there
was
no
time
to
be
wasted
in
idle
sorrowing
immediate
action

required
and
determined

to
the
ground
armed
and
ready
and
a
few
minutes
sufficed
to
prepare
for
the
pursuit
a
fresh
horse
was
procured
for
myself
others
for
the
companions
of
my
late
journey
and
after
snatching
a
breakfast
hastily
prepared
we
mounted
and
struck
off
upon
the
trail
of
the
savages
it
was
easily
followed
for
the
murderers
had
been
mounted
and
their
horses
tracks
betrayed
them
they
had
gone
some
distance
up
the
river
before
crossing
and
then
swam
their
horses
over
to
the
indian
side
without
hesitation
we
did
the
same
the
place
i
remembered
well
i
had
crossed
there
before
two
months
before
while
tracking
the
steed
of
osceola
it
was
the
path
that
had
been
taken
by
the
young
chief
the
coincidence
produced
upon
me
a
certain
impression
and
not
without
pain
did
i
observe
it
it
led
to
reflection
there
was
time
as
the
trail
was
in
places
less
conspicuous
and
the
finding
it
delayed
our
advance
it
led
to
inquiry
had
any
one
seen
the
savages
or
noted
to
what
band
they
belonged
who
was
their
leader
yes
all
these
questions
were
answered
in
the
affirmative
two
men
lying
concealed
by
the
road
had
seen
the
indians
passing
away
had
seen
their
captives
too
my
sister
viola
with
other
girls
of
the
plantation
these
were
on
horseback
each
clasped
in
the
arms
of
a
savage
the
blacks
travelled
afoot
they
were
bound
they
appeared
to
go
willingly
the
indians
were
redsticks
by
such
was
the
belief
of
those
around
me
founded
upon
the
report
of
the
men
who
had
lain
in
ambush
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
impression
produced
upon
me
it
was
painful
in
the
extreme
i
endeavoured
not
to
believe
the
report
i
resolved
not
to
give
it
credence
until
i
should
have
further
confirmation
of
its
truthfulness
osceola
o
heavens
surely
he
would
not
have
done
this
deed
it
could
not
have
been
he
the
men
might
have
been
mistaken
it
was
before
daylight
the
savages
had
been
seen
the
darkness
might
have
deceived
them
every
feat
performed
by
the
indians
every
foray
made
was
put
down
to
the
credit
of
osceola
osceola
was
everywhere
surely
he
had
not
been
there
who
were
the
two
men
the
witnesses
not
without
surprise
did
i
listen
to
the
answer
they
were
and
to
my
surprise
too
i
now
learned
that
they
were
among
the
party
who
followed
me
volunteers
to
aid
me
in
obtaining
revenge
for
my
wrongs
strange
i
thought
but
stranger
still
that
arens
ringgold
was
there
he
had
been
present
at
the
scene
of
the
conflagration
and
as
i
was
told
among
the
loudest
in
his
threats
of
vengeance
but
he
had
returned
home
at
all
events
he
was
not
one
of
the
band
of
pursuers
i
called
spence
and
williams
and
questioned
them
closely
they
adhered
to
their
statement
they
admitted
that
it
was
dark
when
they
had
seen
the
indians
returning
from
the
massacre
they
could
not
tell
for
certain
whether
they
were
the
warriors
of
the
redstick
tribe
or
those
of
the
long
swamp
they
believed
them
to
be
the
former
as
to
who
was
their
leader
they
had
no
doubt
whatever
it
was
osceola
who
led
them
they
knew
him
by
the
three
ostrich
feathers
in
his
which
rendered
him
conspicuous
among
his
followers
these
fellows
spoke
positively
what
interest
could
they
have
in
deceiving
me
what
could
it
matter
to
them
whether
the
chief
of
the
murderous
band
was
osceola
coa
hajo
or
onopa
himself
their
words
produced
conviction
combined
with
other
circumstances
deep
painful
conviction
the
murderer
of
my
mother
he
who
had
fired
my
home
and
borne
my
sister
into
a
cruel
captivity
could
be
no
other
than
osceola
all
memory
of
our
past
friendship
died
upon
the
instant
my
heart
burned
with
hostility
and
hate
for
him
it
had
once
so
ardently
admired
chapter
seventy
five
the
alarm
there
were
other
circumstances
connected
with
the
bloody
affair
that
upon
reflection
appeared
peculiar
and
mysterious
by
the
sudden
shock
my
soul
had
been
completely
benighted
and
these
circumstances
had
escaped
my
notice
i
merely
believed
that
there
had
been
an
onslaught
of
the
indians
in
which
my
mother
had
been
massacred
and
my
sister
borne
away
from
her
home
that
the
savages
not
satisfied
with
blood
had
added
fire
that
these
outrages
had
been
perpetrated
in
revenge
for
past
wrongs
endured
at
the
hands
of
their
enemies
that
the
like
had
occurred
elsewhere
and
was
almost
daily
occurring
why
not
on
the
banks
of
the
suwanee
as
in
other
districts
of
the
country
in
fact
it
had
been
rather
a
matter
of
wonder
that
the
settlement
had
been
permitted
to
remain
so
long
unmolested
others
far
more
remote
from
the
seminole
strongholds
had
already
suffered
a
like
terrible
visitation
and
why
should
ours
escape
the
immunity
had
been
remarked
and
the
inhabitants
had
become
lulled
by
it
into
a
false
security
the
explanation
given
was
that
the
main
body
of
the
indians
had
been
occupied
elsewhere
watching
the
movements
of
scott
triple
army
and
as
our
settlement
was
strong
no
small
band
had
dared
to
come
against
it
but
scott
was
now
gone
his
troops
had
retired
within
the
forts
their
summer
quarters
for
winter
is
the
season
of
campaigning
in
florida
and
the
indians
to
whom
all
seasons
are
alike
were
now
free
to
extend
their
marauding
expeditions
against
the
plantations
this
appeared
the
true
explanation
why
an
attack
upon
the
settlement
of
the
suwanee
had
been
so
long
deferred
during
the
first
burst
of
my
grief
on
receiving
news
of
the
calamity
i
accepted
it
as
such
i
and
mine
had
merely
been
the
victims
of
a
general
vengeance
but
the
moments
of
bewilderment
soon
passed
and
the
peculiar
circumstances
to
which
i
have
alluded
began
to
make
themselves
apparent
to
my
mind
first
of
all
why
was
our
plantation
the
only
one
that
had
been
attacked
our
house
the
only
one
given
to
the
flames
our
family
the
only
one
murdered
these
questions
startled
me
and
natural
it
was
that
they
did
so
there
were
other
plantations
along
the
river
equally
unprotected
other
families
far
more
noted
for
their
hostility
to
the
seminole
race
nay
what
was
yet
a
greater
mystery
the
ringgold
plantation
lay
in
the
very
path
of
the
marauders
as
their
trail
testified
they
had
passed
around
it
to
reach
our
house
and
both
arens
ringgold
and
his
father
had
long
been
notorious
for
bitter
enmity
to
the
red
men
and
violent
aggressions
against
their
rights
why
then
had
the
ringgold
plantation
been
suffered
to
remain
unmolested
while
ours
was
singled
out
for
destruction
were
we
the
victims
of
a
and
special
it
must
have
been
so
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
so
after
long
reflection
i
could
arrive
at
no
other
conclusion
by
this
alone
could
the
mystery
be
solved
and
powell
oh
could
it
have
been
he
my
friend
a
fiend
guilty
of
such
an
atrocious
deed
was
it
probable
was
it
possible
no
neither
despite
the
testimony
of
the
two
men
vile
wretches
i
knew
them
to
be
despite
what
they
had
seen
and
said
my
heart
refused
to
believe
it
what
motive
could
he
have
for
such
special
murder
ah
what
motive
true
my
mother
had
been
unkind
to
him
more
than
that
ungrateful
she
had
once
treated
him
with
scorn
i
remembered
it
well
he
too
might
remember
it
but
surely
he
the
noble
youth
to
my
mind
the
of
heroism
would
scarcely
have
harboured
such
petty
spite
and
for
so
long
would
scarcely
have
repaid
it
by
an
act
of
such
bloody
retribution
no
no
no
besides
would
powell
have
left
untouched
the
dwelling
of
the
ringgolds
of
arens
ringgold
one
of
his
most
hated
foes
one
of
the
four
men
he
had
sworn
to
kill
this
of
itself
was
the
most
improbable
circumstance
connected
with
the
whole
affair
ringgold
had
been
at
home
might
have
been
entrapped
in
his
sleep
his
black
retainers
would
scarcely
have
resisted
at
all
events
they
could
have
been
overcome
as
easily
as
ours
why
was
permitted
to
live
why
was
house
not
given
to
the
flames
upon
the
supposition
that
osceola
was
the
leader
of
the
band
i
could
not
comprehend
why
he
should
have
left
arens
ringgold
to
live
while
killing
those
who
were
scarcely
his
enemies
new
information
imparted
to
me
as
we
advanced
along
the
route
produced
new
reflections
i
was
told
that
the
indians
had
made
a
hasty
departure
that
they
had
in
fact
retreated
the
conflagration
had
attracted
a
large
body
of
citizen
soldiery
a
patrol
upon
its
rounds
and
the
appearance
of
these
unexpected
by
the
savages
had
caused
the
latter
to
scamper
off
to
the
woods
but
for
this
it
was
conjectured
other
plantations
would
have
suffered
the
fate
of
ours
perhaps
that
of
ringgold
himself
the
tale
was
probable
enough
the
band
of
marauders
was
not
large
we
knew
by
their
tracks
there
were
not
more
than
fifty
of
them
and
this
would
account
for
their
retreat
on
the
appearance
even
of
a
smaller
force
the
people
alleged
that
it
was
a
retreat
this
information
gave
a
different
complexion
to
the
affair
i
was
again
driven
to
conjectures
again
forced
to
suspicions
of
osceola
perhaps
i
but
half
understood
his
indian
nature
perhaps
after
all
was
the
monster
who
had
struck
the
blow
once
more
i
interrogated
myself
as
to
his
motive
what
motive

chapter

a
false
alarm
the
significant
shout
at
once
put
a
period
to
my
reflections
believing
the
savages
to
be
in
sight
i
spurred
towards
the
front
the
horsemen
had
drawn
bridle
and
halted
a
few
who
had
been
straggling
from
the
path
hurried
up
and
ranged
themselves
close
to
the
main
body
as
if
for
protection
a
few
others
who
had
been
riding
carelessly
in
the
advance
were
seen
galloping
back
it
was
from
these
last
the
cry
of
indyens
had
come
and
several
of
them
still
continued
to
repeat
it
indyuns
cried
hickman
interrogatively
and
with
an
air
of
incredulity
whar
did
ye
see
them
yonder
responded
one
of
the
retreating
horsemen
in
yon
clump
it
full
o
them
i
be
if
i
believe
it
rejoined
the
old

toss

calling
out

added
in

tone
of
authority
jest

so
saying
he
slipped
down
from
his
saddle
and
commenced
hitching
his
bridle
to
a
branch
come

he
said
addressing
himself
to
his

comrade
you

it

these
fellows
sech
a
scare
weatherford
anticipating
the
request
had
already
dropped
to
the
ground
and
the
two
having
secured
their
horses
rifle
in
hand
slunk
silently
off
into
the
bushes
the
rest
of
the
party
gathering
still
more
closely
together
remained
in
their
saddles
to
await
the
result
there
was
but
slight
trial
upon
their
patience
for
the
two
pioneers
were
scarce
out
of
sight
when
we
heard
their
voices
ringing
together
in
loud
peals
of
laughter
this
encouraged
us
to
advance
where
there
was
so
much
merriment
there
could
be
but
little
danger
and
without
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
scouts
we
rode
forwards
directing
our
course
by
their
continued
cachinnations
an
opening
brought
both
of
them
into
view
weatherford
was
gazing
downwards
as
if
examining
some
tracks
while
hickman
who
saw
us
coming
up
stood
with
extended
arm
pointing
toward
the
straggling
woods
that
lay
beyond
we
turned
our
eyes
in
the
direction
indicated
we
observed
a
number
of
horned
cattle
that
startled
by
the
trampling
of
our
troops
were
scampering
off
among
the
trees
now
cried
the
hunter
triumphantly
thar

every

joined
in

the
that

let
somebody
as

har
on

heads
all
acknowledged
that
hickman
advice
was
sage
and
sound
the
hint
was
taken
and
leaving
the
two
old
hunters
henceforth
to
lead
the
pursuit
the
rest
drew
more
closely
together
and
followed
them
along
the
trail
the
plan
adopted
in
this
instance
was
that
followed
in
all
tracking
parties
when
in
pursuit
of
an
enemy
it
matters
not
of
what
elements
the
body
is
composed
be
it
naval
military
or
civilian
be
there
present
commodores
generals
or
governors
all
yield
the
to
some
old
hunter
or
scout
who
follows
the
trail
like
a
sleuth
hound
and
whose
word
is
supreme
law
for
the
nonce
it
was
evident
the
pursued
party
could
not
be
far
in
advance
of
us
this
we
knew
from
the
hour
at
which
they
had
been
seen
retreating
from
the
settlement
after
my
arrival
on
the
plantation
no
time
had
been
lost
only
ten
minutes
spent
in
preparation
and
altogether
there
was
scarce
an
hour
difference
between
the
times
of
our
starting
the
fresh
trail
confirmed
the
fact
they
could
not
be
a
league
ahead
of
us
unless
they
had
ridden
faster
than
we
this
was
scarce
probable
encumbered
as
they
were
with
their
black
captives
whose
larger
tracks
here
and
there
distinctly
perceptible
showed
that
they
were
marching
afoot
of
course
the
savage
horsemen
would
be
detained
in
getting
them
forwards
and
in
this
lay
our
main
hope
of
overtaking
them
there
were
but
few
who
feared
for
the
result
should
we
only
be
able
to
come
up
with
the
enemy
the
white
men
were
full
of
wrath
and
revenge
and
this
precluded
all
thoughts
of
fear
besides
we
could
tell
by
their
trail
that
the
indians
scarce
outnumbered
us
not
above
fifty
appeared
to
constitute
the
band
no
doubt
they
were
able
warriors
and
our
equals
man
to
man
but
those
who
had
volunteered
to
assist
me
were
also
the
true
grit
the
best
men
of
the
settlement
for
such
a
purpose
no
one
talked
of
going
back
all
declared
their
readiness
to
follow
the
murderers
even
to
the
heart
of
the
indian
territory
even
into
the
cove
itself
the
devotion
of
these
men
cheered
me
and
i
rode
forwards
with
lighter
heart
lighter
with
the
prospect
of
vengeance
which
i
believed
to
be
near
chapter
seventy
seven
a
split
trail
it
proved
not
to
be
so
near
us
as
we
had
anticipated
pressing
forward
as
fast
as
our
guides
could
lift
the
trail
we
followed
it
for
ten
miles
we
had
hoped
to
find
revenge
at
half
the
distance
the
indians
either
knew
that
we
were
after
them
or
with
their
wonted
wisdom
were
marching
rapidly
under
the
mere
suspicion
of
a
pursuit
after
the
committal
of
such
horrid
atrocities
it
was
natural
for
them
to
suppose
they
would
be
pursued
evidently
they
were
progressing
as
fast
as
we
but
not
faster
though
the
sun
was
broiling
hot
sap
still
oozed
from
the
boughs
they
had
accidentally
broken
the
mud
turned
up
by
their
horses
hoofs
as
the
guides
expressed
it
had
not
yet
crusted
over
and
the
crushed
herbage
was
wet
with
its
own
juice
and
still
procumbent
to
the
denizen
of
the
city
accustomed
to
travel
from
street
to
street
by
the
assistance
of
sign
boards
at
every
corner
and
numbers
on
every
door
it
must
appear
almost
incredible
that
the
wild
savage
or
untutored
hunter
can
without
guide
or
compass
unerringly
follow
day
after
day
the
track
of
some
equally
cunning
foe
to
the
pursuing
party
every
leaf
every
twig
every
blade
of
grass
is
a
sign
and
they
read
them
as
plainly
as
if
the
route
were
laid
down
upon
a
map
while
the
pursuing
party
is
thus
attentive
to
detect
sign
the
escaping

is
as
vigilant
to
avoid
leaving
any
and
many
are
the
devices
resorted
to
to
efface

as
he
rose
erect
after
examining
the
tracks
for

time

i
never

o

a
peal
of
laughter
was
the
reply
to
this
sally
of
the
guide
not
so
loud

loud
said
he
interrupting
the
laughter
by
an
earnest
wave
of
his

dogs
and
darn
me
if
i
believe
thar
helf
a
mile
ahead
o
us
the
guide
once
more
bent
himself
over
the
trail
and
after
a
short
reconnoissance
of
the
tracks
repeated
his
last
words
with
more
emphasis
no
by
not
half
a
mile
hush
boys
keep
as
quiet
as
possums
an
i
promise
ye
we
tree
the
varmints
in
a
hour
hush
obedient
to
the
injunctions
we
rode
forwards
as
silently
as
it
was
possible
for
us
to
proceed
on
horseback
we
strove
to
guide
our
horses
along
the
softer
borders
of
the
path
to
prevent
the
thumping
of
their
hoofs
no
one
spoke
above
a
whisper
and
even
then
there
was
but
little
conversation
as
each
was
earnestly
gazing
forwards
expecting
every
moment
to
see
the
bronzed
savages
moving
before
us
in
this
way
we
proceeded
for
another
half
mile
without
seeing
aught
of
the
enemy
except
their
tracks
a
new
object
however
now
came
in
view
the
clear
sky
shining
through
the
trunks
of
the
trees
we
were
all
woodsmen
enough
to
know
that
this
indicated
an
opening
in
the
forest
most
of
my
companions
expressed
pleasure
at
the
sight
we
had
now
been
riding
a
long
way
through
the
sombre
woods
our
path
often
obstructed
by
slimy
and
fallen
logs
so
that
a
slow
pace
had
been
unavoidable
they
believed
that
in
the
open
ground
we
should
move
faster
and
have
a
better
chance
of
sighting
the
pursued
some
of
the
older
heads
and
especially
the
two
guides
were
affected
differently
by
the
new
appearance
hickman
at
once
gave
expression
to
his
chagrin
cuss
the
clarin
he
exclaimed
it
are
a
savanner
an
a
big
too
the
thing
it
spoil
all
how
i
inquired
ye
see
geordy
if
thar
across
it
they
leave
some
on
side
to
watch
they
be
sarten
to
do
that
whether
they
know
we
arter
or
not
wall
what
follers
kin
no
more
cross
bein
seen
than
a
carryvan
o
kaymils
an
what
follers
that
once
they
sighted
us
in
coorse
they
know
how
to
git
out
o
our
way
judjin
from
the
time
we
been
a
travellin
hey
it
darned
near
sundown
i
reckon
we
must
be
clost
to
thar
big
swamp
if
they
spy
us
arter
they
make
strait
custrut
for
thar
and
then
i
know
what
they
do
what
they
scatter
thar
and
ef
they
do
we
might
as
well
go
sarchin
for
in
snow
time
what
should
we
do
it
are
best
for
the
hul
o
ye
to
stop
here
a
bit
me
and
jim
weatherford
steal
forbad
to
the
edge
of
the
timmer
an
see
if
they
got
acrosst
the
savanner
ef
they
are
then
we
must
make
it
the
best
way
we
kin
an
take
up
thar
trail
on
the
tother
aide
thar
no
other
chance
if
we
seen
crossin
the
open
ground
we
may
jest
as
well
turn
tail
to
and
take
the
home
agin
to
the
counsel
of
the
there
was
no
dissenting
voice
all
acknowledged
its
wisdom
and
he
was
left
to
carry
out
the
design
without
opposition
he
and
his
companion
once
more
dismounted
from
their
horses
and
leaving
us
standing
among
the
trees
advanced
stealthily
towards
the
edge
of
the
opening
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
they
came
back
and
the
other
men
were
growing
impatient
many
believed
we
were
only
losing
time
by
this
tardy
reconnoissance
and
the
indians
would
be
getting
further
away
sonde
advised
that
the
pursuit
should
be
continued
at
once
and
that
seen
or
not
we
ought
to
ride
directly
onwards
however
consonant
with
my
own
feelings
burning
as
i
was
for
a
conflict
with
the
murderers
i
knew
it
would
not
be
a
prudent
course
the
guides
were
in
the
right
these
returned
at
length
and
delivered
their
report
there
a
savanna
and
the
indians
had
crossed
it
they
had
got
into
the
timber
on
its
opposite
side
and
neither
man
nor
horse
was
to
be
seen
they
could
scarcely
have
been
out
of
sight
before
hickman
and
weatherford
arrived
upon
its
nearer
edge
and
the
former
averred
that
he
had
seen
the
tail
of
one
of
their
horses
disappearing
among
the
bushes
during
their
absence
the
cunning
trackers
had
learned
more
from
the
sign
they
had
gathered
another
important
fact
that
there
was
no
longer
trail
for
us
to
on
entering
the
savanna
the
indians
had
the
paths
they
had
taken
across
the
grassy
meadow
were
as
numerous
as
their
horses
as
the
hunter
expressed
it
the
trail
war
split
up
into
fifty
pieces
the
latter
had
ascertained
this
by
crawling
out
among
the
long
grass
and
noting
the
tracks
one
in
particular
had
occupied
their
attention
it
was
not
made
by
the
of
horses
though
some
of
these
ran
alongside
but
by
the
feet
of
men
they
were
naked
feet
and
a
superficial
observer
might
have
fancied
that
but
one
pair
of
them
had
passed
over
the
ground
the
skilled
trackers
however
knew
this
to
be
a
the
prints
were
large
and
misshapen
and
too
deeply
indented
in
the
soil
to
have
been
produced
by
a
single
individual
the
long
heel
and
scarcely
convex
instep
the
huge
balls
and
broad
prints
of
the
toes
were
all
signs
that
the
hunters
easily
understood
they
knew
that
it
was
the
trail
of
the
negro
captives
who
had
proceeded
thus
by
the
direction
of
their
captors
this
unexpected
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
retreating
savages
created
chagrin
as
well
as
astonishment
for
the
moment
all
felt
outwitted
we
believed
that
the
enemy
was
lost
we
should
be
cheated
of
our
revenge
some
even
talked
of
the
idleness
of
carrying
the
pursuit
further
a
few
counselled
us
to
go
back
and
it
became
necessary
to
appeal
to
their
hatred
of
the
savage
foe
with
most
of
them
a
hereditary
passion
and
once
more
to
invoke
their
vengeance
at
this
crisis
old
hickman
cheered
the
men
with
fresh
hope
i
was
glad
to
hear
him
speak
we
ca
get
at
boys
said
he
after
much
talk
had
been
spent
we
dasent
cross
over
this
hyar
clearin
by
daylight
an
too
big
to
git
roun
it
it
take
a
twenty
mile
ride
to
circumvent
the
durned
thing
a
mind
let
us
halt
hyar
till
the
dark
comes
on
then
we
kin
steal
across
an
if
me
an
jim
weatherford
do
scare
up
the
trail
on
the
tother
side
then
this
child
never
ate
allygator
i
know
they
come
thegither
agin
an
we
be
like
enough
to
find
the
durned
varments
camped
somewhar
in
a
clump
not
seein
us
arter
any
more
they
be
feelin
as
safe
as
a
bear
in
a
bee
tree
an
jest
the
time
to
take
the
plan
was
adopted
and
dismounting
from
our
jaded
horses
we
awaited
the
setting
of
the
sun
there
are
few
situations
more
trying
to
the
boiling
blood
and
fury
of
the
pursuer
especially
if
he
have
bitter
cause
for
vengeance
than
a
check
in
the
chase
the
loss
of
the
trail
of
course
often
involves
the
escape
of
the
foe
and
though
it
may
be
after
a
while
recovered
yet
the
delay
affords
such
advantage
to
the
enemy
that
every
moment
serves
only
to
increase
the
anxiety
and
whet
the
fury
of
the
pursuer
this
then
was
my
case
on
the
present
occasion
while
yielding
to
the
advice
of
the
hunter
because
i
knew
it
to
be
the
best
plan
under
the
circumstances
i
nevertheless
could
scarce
control
my
impatience
or
submit
to
the
delay
but
felt
impelled
to
hurry
forward
and
alone
and
if
need
be
inflict
upon
the
savage
miscreants
the
punishment
due
to
their
murderous
deeds
chapter
seventy
eight
crossing
the
savanna
we
now
suffered
the
very
acme
of
misery
while
riding
in
hot
haste
along
the
trail
there
was
an
excitement
almost
continuous
that
precluded
the
possibility
of
intense
reflection
and
kept
my
mind
from
dwelling
too
minutely
upon
the
calamity
that
had
befallen
me
the
prospect
of
retribution
ever
appearing
nearer
at
hand
at
every
step
nearer
all
but
cancelled
my
emotions
of
grief
and
motion
itself
knowing
it
to
be
forward
and
towards
the
object
of
hatred
had
a
certain
effect
in
soothing
my
troubled
soul
now
that
the
pursuit
was
suspended
and
i
was
free
to
reflect
on
the
events
of
the
morning
my
soul
was
plunged
into
the
deepest
misery
my
fancy
distressed
me
with
dire
images
before
me
appeared
the
corpse
of
my
murdered
mother
her
arms
outstretched
waving
me
on
to
vengeance
my
sister
too
wan
tearful
dishevelled
dishonoured
no
wonder
that
with
painful
impatience
i
awaited
the
going
down
of
the
sun
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
that
grand
orb
sink
so
slowly
the
delay
tortured
me
almost
to
distraction
the
sun
disc
was
blood
red
from
a
thick
haze
that
hung
over
the
woods
the
heavens
appeared
lowering
and
angry
they
had
the
hue
of
my
own
spirit
at
length
twilight
came
on
short
it
was
as
is
usual
in
southern
latitudes
though
it
appeared
long
and
tardy
in
passing
away
darkness
followed
and
once
more
springing
to
my
saddle
i
found
relief
in
motion
emerging
from
the
timber
we
rode
out
upon
the
open
savanna
the
two
hunters
acting
as
guides
conducted
us
across
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
follow
any
of
the
numerous
trails
in
the
darkness
it
would
have
been
impossible
but
even
had
there
been
light
enough
left
them
the
guides
would
have
pursued
a
different
course
hickman
conjecture
was
that
on
reaching
the
opposite
side
the
marauding
party
would
come
together
at
some
rendezvous
previously
agreed
upon
the
trail
of
any
one
therefore
would
be
sufficient
for
our
purpose
and
in
all
probability
would
conduct
us
to
their
camp
our
only
aim
then
was
to
get
across
the
savanna
unobserved
and
this
the
darkness
might
enable
us
to
accomplish
silently
as
spectres
we
marched
over
the
open
meadow
we
rode
with
extreme
slowness
lest
the
should
be
heard
our
tired
steeds
needed
no
taming
down
the
ground
was
favourable
a
surface
of
soft
grassy
turf
over
which
our
animals
glided
with
noiseless
tread
our
only
fears
were
that
they
should
scent
the
horses
of
the
indians
and
betray
us
by
their
neighing
happily
our
fears
proved
groundless
and
after
half
an
hour
silent
marching
we
reached
the
other
side
of
the
savanna
and
drew
up
under
the
shadowy
trees
it
was
scarce
possible
we
could
have
been
observed
if
the
indians
had
left
spies
behind
them
the
darkness
would
have
concealed
us
from
their
view
and
we
had
made
no
noise
by
which
our
approach
could
have
been
discovered
unless
their
sentinels
had
been
placed
at
the
very
point
where
we
the
woods
we
saw
no
signs
of
any
and
we
believed
that
none
of
the
band
had
lingered
behind
and
we
had
not
been
seen
we
congratulated
one
another
in
whispers
and
in
like
manner
deliberated
on
our
future
plans
of
proceeding
we
were
still
in
our
saddles
with
the
intention
to
proceed
further
we
should
have
dismounted
upon
the
spot
and
waited
for
the
light
of
morning
to
enable
us
to
take
up
the
trail
but
circumstances
forbade
this
our
horses
were
suffering
from
thirst
and
their
riders
were
no
better
off
we
had
met
with
no
water
since
before
noon
and
a
few
hours
under
the
burning
skies
of
florida
are
sufficient
to
render
thirst
intolerable
whole
days
in
a
colder
climate
would
scarce
have
an
equal
effect
both
horses
and
men
suffered
acutely
we
could
neither
sleep
nor
rest
without
relief
water
must
be
sought
for
before
a
halt
could
be
made
we
felt
hunger
as
well
for
scarce
any
provision
had
been
made
for
the
long
march
but
the
pangs
of
this
appetite
were
easier
to
be
endured
water
of
itself
would
satisfy
us
for
the
night
and
we
resolved
to
ride
forward
in
search
of
it
in
this
dilemma
the
experience
of
our
two
guides
promised
relief
they
had
once
made
a
hunting
excursion
to
the
savanna
we
had
crossed
it
was
in
the
times
when
the
tribes
were
friendly
and
white
men
were
permitted
to
pass
freely
through
the
reserve
they
remembered
a
pond
at
which
upon
that
occasion
they
had
made
their
temporary
encampment
they
believed
it
was
not
far
distant
from
the
spot
where
we
had
arrived
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
darkness
but
to
suffer
on
or
search
for
it
were
our
only
alternatives
the
latter
was
of
course
adopted
and
once
more
allowing
hickman
and
weatherford
to
pioneer
the
way
the
rest
of
us
rode
silently
after
we
moved
in
single
file
each
horse
guided
by
the
one
that
immediately
preceded
him
in
the
darkness
no
other
mode
of
march
could
be
adopted
our
party
was
thus
strung
out
into
a
long
line
here
and
there
curving
according
to
the
sinuosities
of
the
path
and
gliding
like
some
monstrous
serpent
among
the
trees
chapter
seventy
nine
groping
among
the
timber
at
intervals
the
guides
were
at
fault
and
then
the
whole
line
was
forced
to
halt
and
remain
motionless
several
times
both
hickman
and
weatherford
were
puzzled
as
to
the
direction
they
should
take
they
had
lost
the
points
of
the
compass
and
were
bewildered
had
there
been
light
they
could
have
recovered
this
knowledge
by
observing
the
bark
upon
the
trees
a
craft
to
the
backwoods
hunter
but
it
was
too
dark
to
make
such
an
observation
even
amidst
the
darkness
hickman
alleged
he
could
tell
north
from
south
by
the
feel
of
the
bark
and
for
this
purpose
i
now
saw
him
groping
against
the
trunks
i
noticed
that
he
passed
from
one
to
another
trying
several
of
them
the
better
to
confirm
his
observations
after
carrying
on
these
singular
manoeuvres
for
a
period
of
several
minutes
he
turned
to
his
comrade
with
an
exclamation
that
betokened
surprise
my
cats
jim
said
he
speaking
in
an
undertone
these
woods
are
altered
since
you
and
i
war
hyar
what
the
ole
scratch
kin
be
the
matter
wi
the
bark
all
peeled
off
and
thar
as
dry
as
punk
i
was
thinkin
they
had
a
kewrious
look
replied
the
other
but
i
it
was
the
darkness
o
the
night
neer
a
bit
of
it
the
trees
is
altered
someways
since
we
war
hyar
afore
they
are
broom
pines
that
i
recollect
well
enough
let
git
a
bunch
o
the
leaves
and
see
how
they
looks
saying
this
he
reached
his
hand
upwards
and
plucked
one
of
the
long
fascicles
that
drooped
overhead
ugh
continued
he
crushing
the
needles
between
his
fingers
i
see
how
it
are
now
the
darnationed
moths
has
been
at
the
trees
are
dead
think
thar
all
dead
he
inquired
after
a
pause
and
then
advancing
a
little
he
proceeded
to
examine
some
others
dead
as
durnation
every
tree
o
wal
we
must
go
by
thar
no
help
for
it
boys
ole
hick
kin
guide
you
no
furrer
dead
beat
and
know
no
more
the
direkshun
o
that
ere
pond
than
the
greenest
greenhorn
among
ye
this
acknowledgment
produced
no
very
pleasant
effect
thirst
was
torturing
all
those
who
heard
it
hitherto
trusting
that
the
skill
of
the
hunters
would
enable
them
to
find
water
they
had
sustained
it
with
a
degree
of
patience
it
was
now
felt
more
acutely
than
ever
stay
said
hickman
after
a
few
moments
had
elapsed
all
not
lost
that
in
danger
if
i
ar
able
to
guide
ye
to
the
pond
i
reckon
i
got
a
critter
as
kin
kin
you
ole
hoss
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
the
animal
he
bestrode
a
wiry
old
jade
that
hickman
had
long
been
master
of
kin
you
find
the
water
gee
up
ole
beeswax
and
see
if
you
kin
giving
his
critter
a
kick
in
the
ribs
and
at
the
same
time
full
freedom
of
the
bridle
he
once
more
started
forwards
among
the
trees
we
all
followed
as
before
building
fresh
hopes
upon
the
instinct
of
the
animal
surely
the
pride
of
man
ought
to
be
somewhat
abased
when
he
reflects
that
he
the
lord
of
the
creation
is
oftentimes
foiled
in
attempts
which
by
the
mere
instincts
of
the
lower
animals
are
of
easy
accomplishment
what
a
lesson
of
humility
this
ought
to
teach
to
the
wanton
and
cruel
oppressor
of
those
noble
animals
whose
strength
and
instinct
and
endurance
are
all
made
subservient
to
his
comfort
it
is
in
the
hour
of
danger
and
peril
alone
that
man
realises
his
dependence
upon
agencies
other
than
his
own
lordly
will
we
had
not
proceeded
far
when
it
became
known
that
hickman
horse
had
got
scent
of
the
water
his
owner
alleged
that
he
smelt
it
and
the
latter
knew
this
as
well
as
if
it
had
been
one
of
his
hounds
taking
up
the
trail
of
a
deer
the
horse
actually
exhibited
signs
of
such
an
intelligence
his
muzzle
was
protruded
forwards
and
now
and
then
he
was
heard
to
sniff
the
air
while
at
the
same
time
he
walked
forward
in
a
direct
line
as
if
making
for
some
object
surely
he
was
heading
for
water
such
was
the
belief
it
produced
a
cheering
effect
and
the
men
were
now
advancing
in
better
spirits
when
to
their
surprise
hickman
suddenly
drew
up
and
halted
the
line
i
rode
forward
to
him
to
inquire
the
cause
i
found
him
silent
and
apparently
reflective
why
have
you
stopped
i
inquired
you
must
all
o
ye
wait
here
a
bit
why
must
we
demanded
several
who
had
pressed
along
side
safe
for
us
to
go
forrad
this
way
i
got
a
idea
that
them
red
skins
is
by
the
pond
they
camped
there
for
sartin
it
the
only
water
that
is
about
hyar
and
its
devilitch
like
that
thar
rendevoozed
an
camped
if
that
be
the
case
an
we
ride
forrad
in
this
fashion
they
hear
us
an
be
off
agin
into
the
bushes
whar
we
see
no
more
o
them
ai
that
like
enough
fellers
this
interrogatory
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
wal
then
continued
the
guide
better
for
yous
all
to
stay
hyar
while
me
and
jim
weatherford
goes
forrad
to
see
if
the
indyuns
is
thar
we
kin
find
the
pond
now
i
know
whar
it
lies
by
the
direkshun
the
hoss
war
taken
it
aint
fur
off
if
the
red
skins
aint
thar
we
soon
be
back
an
then
ye
kin
all
come
on
as
fast
as
ye
like
this
prudent
course
was
willingly
agreed
to
and
the
two
hunters
once
more
dismounting
stole
forwards
afoot
they
made
no
objection
to
my
going
along
with
them
my
misfortunes
gave
me
a
claim
to
be
their
leader
and
leaving
my
bridle
in
the
hands
of
one
of
my
companions
i
accompanied
the
guides
upon
their
errand
we
walked
with
noiseless
tread
the
ground
was
thickly
covered
with
the
long
needles
of
the
pine
forming
a
soft
bed
upon
which
the
footstep
made
no
sound
there
was
little
or
no
underwood
and
this
enabled
us
to
advance
with
rapidity
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
a
long
way
from
the
party
we
had
left
behind
our
only
care
was
about
keeping
the
right
direction
and
this
we
had
almost
lost
or
believed
so
when
to
our
astonishment
we
beheld
a
light
shining
through
the
trees
it
was
the
gleam
of
a
fire
that
appeared
to
be
blazing
freely
hickman
at
once
pronounced
it
the
camp
fire
of
the
indians
at
first
we
thought
of
returning
and
bringing
on
our
comrades
to
the
attack
but
upon
reflection
we
determined
to
approach
nearer
the
fire
and
make
certain
whether
it
was
the
enemy
camp
we
advanced
no
longer
in
erect
attitudes
but
crawling
upon
our
hands
and
knees
wherever
the
glare
penetrated
the
woods
we
avoided
it
and
kept
under
the
shadow
of
the
the
fire
burned
in
the
midst
of
an
opening
the
hunters
remembered
that
the
pond
was
so
placed
and
now
observing
the
sheen
of
water
we
knew
it
must
be
the
same
we
drew
nearer
and
nearer
until
it
was
no
longer
safe
to
advance
we
were
close
to
the
edge
of
the
timber
that
concealed
us
we
could
see
the
whole
surface
of
the
open
ground
there
were
horses
picketed
over
it
and
dark
forms
recumbent
under
the
fire
light
they
were
murderers
asleep
close
to
the
fire
one
was
seated
upon
a
saddle
he
appeared
to
be
awake
though
his
head
was
drooped
to
the
level
of
his
knees
the
blaze
was
shining
upon
this
man
face
and
both
his
features
and
complexion
might
have
been
seen
but
for
the
interposition
of
paint
and
plumes
the
face
appeared
of
a
crimson
red
and
three
black
ostrich
feathers
bending
over
the
brow
hung
straggling
down
his
cheeks
these
plumed
symbols
produced
painful
recognition
i
knew
that
it
was
the
of
osceola
i
looked
further
several
groups
were
beyond
in
fact
the
whole
open
space
was
crowded
with
prostrate
human
forms
there
was
one
group
however
that
fixed
my
attention
it
consisted
of
three
or
four
individuals
seated
or
reclining
along
the
grass
they
were
in
shade
and
from
our
position
their
features
could
not
be
recognised
but
their
white
dresses
and
the
outlines
of
their
forms
soft
even
in
the
obscurity
of
the
shadow
told
that
they
were
females
two
of
them
were
side
by
side
a
little
apart
from
the
others
one
appeared
to
be
supporting
the
other
whose
head
rested
in
her
lap
with
emotions
fearfully
vivid
i
gazed
on
these
two
forms
i
had
no
doubt
they
were
viola
and
my
sister
chapter
eighty
signal
shots
i
shall
not
attempt
to
depict
my
emotions
at
that
moment
my
pen
is
unequal
to
the
task
think
of
my
situation
and
fancy
them
if
you
can
behind
me
a
mother
murdered
and
basely
mutilated
a
near
relative
slain
in
like
fashion
my
home
my
whole
property
given
to
the
flames
before
me
a
sister
torn
from
the
maternal
embrace
borne
ruthlessly
along
by
savage
captors
perhaps
defiled
by
their
fiendish
leader
and
he
too
before
my
eyes
the
false
perfidious
friend
the
ravisher
the
murderer
had
i
not
cue
for
indulging
in
the
wildest
emotions
and
wild
they
were
each
moment
growing
wilder
as
i
gazed
upon
the
object
of
my
vengeance
they
were
fast
rising
beyond
my
control
my
muscles
seemed
to
swell
with
renewed
rage
the
blood
coursed
through
my
veins
like
streams
of
liquid
fire
i
almost
forgot
the
situation
in
which
we
were
but
one
thought
was
in
my
mind
vengeance
its
object
was
before
me
unconscious
of
my
presence
as
if
he
had
been
asleep
almost
within
reach
of
my
hand
perfectly
within
range
of
my
rifle
i
raised
the
piece
to
the
level
of
those
drooping
plumes
i
sighted
their
tips
i
knew
that
the
eyes
were
underneath
them
my
finger
rested
against
the
trigger
in
another
instant
that
form
in
my
eyes
hitherto
heroic
would
have
been
lifeless
upon
the
grass
but
my
comrades
forbade
the
act
with
a
quick
instinct
hickman
grasped
the
lock
of
my
gun
covering
the
nipple
with
his
broad
palm
while
weatherford
clutched
at
and
held
the
barrel
i
was
no
longer
master
of
the
piece
i
was
angry
at
the
interruption
but
only
for
an
instant
a
reflection
convinced
me
they
had
acted
right
the
old
hunter
putting
his
lips
close
to
my
ear
addressed
me
in
an
earnest
whisper
not
yit
geordie
not
yit
for
your
life
do
make
a
fuss
be
no
use
to
kill
the
rest
o
the
varmints
ud
be
sartin
to
git
off
and
sartin
to
toat
the
weemen
along
wi
we
three
aint
enough
to
stop
we
only
get
scalped
ourselves
we
must
slide
back
for
the
others
an
then
we
be
able
to
surround
that
the
idea
aint
it
jim
weatherford
fearing
to
trust
his
voice
nodded
an
affirmative
come
then
added
hickman
in
the
same
low
whisper
we
mus
lose
a
minute
let
get
back
as
rapidly
as
possible
keep
your
backs
low
down
genteely
genteely
and
as
he
continued
giving
these
injunctions
he
faced
towards
the
ground
extended
his
body
to
its
full
length
and
crawling
off
like
an
alligator
was
soon
lost
behind
the
trunks
of
the
trees
weatherford
and
i
followed
in
similar
fashion
until
safe
beyond
the
circle
of
the
fire
light
when
all
three
of
us
came
to
a
stop
and
arose
erect
to
our
feet
we
stood
for
a
moment
listening
we
were
not
without
anxiety
lest
our
retreat
might
have
disturbed
the
camp
but
no
sounds
reached
us
save
those
to
which
we
had
been
listening
the
snore
of
some
sleeping
savage
the
of
the
browsing
horses
or
the
stamp
of
a
hoof
upon
the
firm
turf
satisfied
that
we
had
passed
away
unobserved
we
started
upon
the
which
the
hunters
could
now
follow
like
a
path
to
them
we
advanced
dark
as
it
was
almost
in
a
run
and
were
progressing
rapidly
when
our
speed
was
suddenly
checked
by
the
report
of
a
gun
each
halted
as
if
shot
surprise
it
was
that
stopped
us
for
the
report
came
not
from
the
indian
camp
but
the
opposite
direction
that
in
which
our
party
had
been
left
but
it
could
not
be
one
of
them
who
had
fired
they
were
at
too
great
a
distance
for
their
guns
to
have
been
heard
so
distinctly
had
they
advanced
nearer
tired
of
waiting
for
our
return
were
they
still
advancing
if
so
the
shot
was
most
imprudent
it
would
be
certain
to
put
the
camp
on
the
what
had
they
fired
at
it
might
have
been
an
accidental
discharge
it
must
have
been
these
conjectures
were
rapid
as
thought
itself
we
did
not
communicate
them
to
one
another
each
fancied
them
for
himself
we
had
scarce
time
even
to
speak
when
a
second
shot
rang
in
our
ears
it
came
from
the
same
direction
as
the
former
appearing
almost
a
repetition
and
had
there
been
time
to
reload
we
should
so
have
judged
it
but
there
had
not
been
time
even
for
the
most
accomplished
rifleman
two
guns
therefore
had
been
fired
my
companions
were
puzzled
as
well
as
myself
the
firing
was
inexplicable
under
any
other
hypothesis
than
that
some
indians
had
strayed
from
their
camp
and
were
making
signals
of
distress
we
had
no
time
to
reflect
we
could
now
hear
behind
us
the
camp
in
full
alarm
and
we
knew
it
was
the
shots
that
had
caused
it
we
heard
the
shouts
of
men
the
neighing
and
hurried
trampling
of
horses
without
pausing
longer
we
again
hurried
onwards
in
the
direction
of
our
friends
further
on
we
perceived
some
men
on
horseback
two
there
appeared
to
be
but
in
the
darkness
we
were
not
certain
as
their
forms
were
scarce
distinguishable
they
appeared
to
retreat
as
we
approached
gliding
off
like
ghosts
among
the
trees
no
doubt
these
were
they
who
had
fired
the
shots
they
were
just
in
the
direction
whence
the
reports
had
come
and
at
the
proper
distance
were
they
indians
or
whites
hoping
they
were
our
friends
risking
the
chances
of
their
being
our
foes
old
hickman
hailed
them
we
paused
to
listen
there
was
no
reply
not
even
an
exclamation
from
either
we
could
hear
by
the
of
their
horses
that
they
were
hurrying
off
in
a
direction
altogether
different
from
either
our
party
or
the
camp
there
was
something
mysterious
in
the
behaviour
of
these
horsemen
for
what
purpose
had
they
fired
their
guns
if
to
signal
the
camp
why
had
they
retreated
from
us
as
we
came
from
it
why
moreover
had
they
gone
off
in
a
direction
that
did
not
lead
to
it
for
its
position
was
now
known
to
them
by
the
noise
of
the
alarm
they
had
themselves
occasioned
to
me
their
behaviour
was
inexplicable
hickman
appeared
to
have
found
some
clue
to
it
and
the
knowledge
seemed
to
have
a
angular
effect
upon
him
he
exhibited
signs
of
surprise
mingled
with
strong
feelings
of
indignation

had
not

before
we
came
within
of
voices
mingled
with
the
hollow
thumping
of
horses

we
recognised
the
voices
as
those
of
our
comrades
and
hailed
them
as
they
came
nearer
for
we
perceived
that
they
were
advancing
towards
us
they
had
heard
the
reports
and
believing
them
to
proceed
from
our
rifles
had
fancied
we
were
engaged
with
the
indians

were
now
riding

some
seconds
duration
evidently
the

men
were
not
there

would
have
answered

and
with
this
emphatic
utterance
the
old
hunter
dashed
into
the
front
and
led
the
way
towards
the
camp
of
the
savages
the
men
followed
the
horses
crowding
upon
each
heels
no
strategic
method
was
observed
time
was
the
important
consideration
and
the
aim
was
to
get
up
to
the
camp
before
the
indians
could
retreat
from
it
a
bold
charge
into
their
midst
a
volley
from
our
guns
and
then
with
knives
and
pistols
to
close
the
conflict
this
was
the
programme
that
had
been
hastily
agreed
upon
we
had
arrived
near
the
camp
within
three
hundred
yards
of
it
there
was
no
uncertainty
as
to
the
direction
the
voices
of
the
savages
that
continued
to
be
heard
ever
since
the
first
alarm
served
to
guide
us
on
the
way
all
at
once
these
voices
became
bushed
no
longer
reached
us
either
the
shouting
of
the
men
or
the
hurried
trampling
of
their
horses
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
all
was
still
as
death
but
we
no
longer
needed
the
guidance
of
sounds
we
were
within
sight
of
the
camp
fires
or
at
least
of
their
light
that
glittered
afar
among
the
trees
with
this
as
our
beacon
we
continued
to
advance
we
rode
forwards
but
now
less
recklessly
the
change
from
confused
noise
to
perfect
silence
had
been
so
sudden
and
abrupt
as
to
have
the
effect
of
making
us
more
cautious
the
very
stillness
appeared
ominous
we
read
in
it
a
warning
it
rendered
us
suspicious
of
an
ambuscade
the
more
so
as
all
had
heard
of
the
great
talent
of
the
redstick
chief
for
this
very
mode
of
attack
when
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
fires
our
party
halted
several
dismounted
and
advanced
on
foot
they
glided
from
trunk
to
trunk
till
they
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
opening
and
then
came
back
to
report
the
camp
was
no
longer
in
existence
its
occupants
were
gone
indians
horses
captives
plunder
had
all
disappeared
from
the
ground
the
fires
alone
remained
they
showed
evidence
of
being
disturbed
in
the
confusion
of
the
hasty
decampment
the
red
embers
were
strewed
over
the
grass
their
last
flames
faintly
flickering
away
the
scouts
continued
to
advance
among
the
trees
till
they
had
made
the
full
circuit
of
the
little
opening
for
a
hundred
yards
around
it
the
woods
were
searched
with
caution
and
ease
but
no
enemy
was
encountered
no
ambuscade
we
had
arrived
too
late
and
the
savage
foes
had
escaped
us
had
carried
off
their
captives
from
under
our
very
eyes
it
was
impossible
to
follow
them
in
the
darkness
and
with
mortified
spirits
we
advanced
into
the
opening
and
took
possession
of
the
deserted
camp
it
was
our
determination
to
remain
there
for
the
rest
of
the
night
and
renew
the
pursuit
in
the
morning
our
first
care
was
to
quench
our
thirst
by
the
pond
then
that
of
our
animals
the
fires
were
next
extinguished
and
a
ring
of
sentries
consisting
of
nearly
half
the
number
of
our
party
was
placed
among
the
that
stood
thickly
around
the
opening
the
horses
were
staked
over
the
ground
and
the
men
stretched
themselves
along
the
sward
so
lately
occupied
by
the
bodies
of
their
savage
foes
in
this
wise
we
awaited
the
dawning
of
day
to
none
of
our
party
not
even
to
myself
was
this
escape
of
the
enemy
or
circumvention
as
he
termed
it
so
mortifying
as
to
old
hickman
who
though
priding
himself
upon
his
superior
cunning
and
woodcraft
was
obliged
to
confess
himself
outwitted
by
a
rascally
redstick
chapter
eighty
two
a
dead
forest
my
comrades
wearied
with
the
long
ride
were
soon
in
deep
slumber
the
sentries
only
keeping
awake
for
me
was
neither
rest
nor
sleep
my
misery
forbade
repose
most
of
the
night
i
spent
in
passing
to
and
fro
around
the
little
pond
that
lay
faintly
gleaming
in
the
centre
of
the
open
ground
i
fancied
i
found
relief
in
thus
roving
about
it
seemed
to
still
the
agitation
of
my
spirit
and
prevented
my
reflections
from
becoming
too
intense
a
new
regret
occupied
my
thoughts
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
carried
out
my
intention
to
fire
at
the
chief
of
the
murderers
i
regretted
i
had
not
killed
him
on
the
spot
the
monster
had
escaped
and
my
sister
was
still
in
his
power
perhaps
beyond
the
hope
of
rescue
as
i
thought
thus
i
blamed
the
hunters
for
having
hindered
me
had
they
foreseen
the
result
they
might
have
acted
otherwise
but
it
was
beyond
human
foresight
to
have
anticipated
the
alarm
the
two
men
who
had
caused
it
were
again
with
us
their
conduct
so
singular
and
mysterious
had
given
rise
to
strong
suspicion
of
their
loyalty
and
their
they
had
joined
us
while
advancing
towards
the
camp
had
been
hailed
with
an
outburst
of
angry
menace
some
even
talked
of
shooting
them
out
of
their
saddles
and
this
threat
would
most
probably
have
been
carried
into
effect
had
the
fellows
not
offered
a
ready
explanation
they
alleged
that
they
had
got
separated
from
the
troop
before
it
made
its
last
halt
how
they
did
not
say
that
they
knew
nothing
of
the
advance
of
the
scouts
or
that
the
indians
were
near
that
they
had
got
lost
in
the
woods
and
had
fired
their
guns
as
signals
in
hopes
that
we
should
answer
them
they
acknowledged
having
met
three
men
afoot
but
they
believed
them
to
be
indians
and
kept
out
of
their
way
that
afterwards
seeing
the
party
near
they
had
recognised
and
ridden
up
to
it
most
of
the
men
were
contented
with
this
explanation
what
motive
reasoned
they
could
the
two
have
in
giving
an
alarm
to
the
enemy
who
could
suspect
them
of
rank
treason
not
all
however
were
satisfied
i
heard
old
hickman
whisper
some
strange
words
to
his
comrade
as
he
glanced
significantly
towards
the
estrays
keep
yur
eye
skinned
jim
and
watch
the
skunks
well
thares
not
hulsome
about
as
there
was
no
one
who
could
openly
accuse
them
they
were
once
more
admitted
into
the
ranks
and
were
now
among
those
who
were
stretched
out
and
sleeping
they
lay
close
to
the
edge
of
the
water
in
my
rounds
i
passed
them
repeatedly
and
in
the
sombre
darkness
i
could
just
distinguish
their
prostrate
forms
i
regarded
them
with
strange
emotions
for
i
shared
the
suspicions
of
hickman
and
weatherford
i
could
scarce
doubt
that
these
fellows
had
strayed
off
on
purpose
that
actuated
by
some
foul
motive
they
had
fired
their
guns
to
warn
the
indians
of
the
approach
of
our
party
after
midnight
there
was
a
moon
there
were
no
clouds
to
intercept
her
beams
and
on
rising
above
the
she
poured
down
a
flood
of
brilliant
light
the
sleepers
were
awakened
by
the
sudden
change
some
rose
to
their
feet
believing
it
to
be
day
it
was
only
upon
glancing
up
to
the
heavens
they
became
aware
of
their
mistake
the
noise
had
put
every
one
on
the
alert
and
some
talked
of
continuing
the
pursuit
by
the
light
of
the
moon
such
a
course
would
have
coincided
with
my
own
wishes
but
the
opposed
it
their
reasons
were
just
in
open
ground
they
could
have
lifted
the
trail
but
under
the
timber
the
moon
light
would
not
have
availed
them
they
could
have
tracked
by
but
this
would
only
be
to
expose
us
to
an
ambuscade
of
the
enemy
even
to
advance
by
moonlight
would
be
to
subject
ourselves
to
a
like
danger
circumstances
had
changed
the
savages
now
knew
we
were
after
them
in
a
the
pursued
have
the
advantage
of
the
pursuers
even
though
their
numbers
be
inferior
the
darkness
gives
them
every
facility
of
effecting
a
surprise
thus
reasoned
the
guides
no
one
made
opposition
to
their
views
and
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
keep
our
ground
till
daylight
it
was
time
to
change
the
sentinels
those
who
had
slept
now
took
post
and
the
relieved
guard
came
in
and
flung
themselves
down
to
snatch
a
few
hours
of
rest
williams
and
spence
took
their
turn
with
the
rest
they
were
posted
on
one
side
the
glade
and
next
to
one
another
hickman
and
weatherford
had
fulfilled
their
guard
tour
as
they
stretched
themselves
along
the
grass
i
noticed
that
they
had
chosen
a
spot
near
to
where
the
suspected
men
were
placed
by
the
moonlight
they
must
have
had
a
view
of
the
latter
notwithstanding
their
recumbent
attitudes
the
hunters
did
not
appear
to
go
to
sleep
i
observed
them
at
intervals
their
heads
were
close
together
and
slightly
raised
above
the
ground
as
if
they
were
whispering
to
one
another
as
before
i
walked
round
and
round
the
moonlight
enabling
me
to
move
more
rapidly
ofttimes
did
i
make
the
circuit
of
the
little
pond
how
oft
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
my
steps
were
mechanical
my
thoughts
had
no
connection
with
the
physical
exertions
i
was
making
and
i
took
no
note
of
how
i
progressed
after
a
time
there
came
a
lull
over
my
spirits
for
a
short
interval
both
my
griefs
and
vengeful
passions
seemed
to
have
departed
i
knew
the
cause
it
was
a
mere
psychological
phenomenon
one
of
common
occurrence
the
nerves
that
were
organs
of
the
peculiar
emotions
under
which
i
had
been
suffering
had
grown
wearied
and
refused
to
act
i
knew
it
was
but
a
temporary
calm
the
lull
between
two
billows
of
the
storm
during
its
continuance
i
was
sensible
to
impressions
from
external
objects
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
singularity
of
the
scene
around
me
the
bright
moonlight
enabled
me
to
note
its
features
somewhat
minutely
we
were
encamped
upon
what
by
backwoodsmen
is
technically
termed
a
oftener
in
their
idiom
a
gleed
a
small
opening
in
the
woods
without
timber
or
trees
of
any
sort
this
one
was
circular
about
fifty
yards
in
diameter
with
the
peculiarity
of
having
a
pond
in
its
midst
the
pond
which
was
only
a
few
yards
in
circumference
was
also
a
circle
perfectly
concentric
with
the
glade
itself
it
was
one
of
those
singular
natural
basins
found
throughout
the
peninsula
and
appearing
as
if
scooped
out
by
mechanic
art
it
was
deeply
sunk
in
the
earth
and
filled
with
water
till
within
three
feet
of
its
rim
the
liquid
was
cool
and
clear
and
under
the
moonbeams
shone
with
a
silvery
effulgence
of
the
glade
itself
nothing
more
except
that
it
was
covered
with
flowers
that
now
crushed
under
the
hoofs
of
horses
and
the
heels
of
man
gave
forth
a
redoubled
fragrance
the
picture
was
pretty
under
happier
circumstances
i
should
have
contemplated
it
with
pleasure
but
it
was
not
the
picture
that
so
much
occupied
my
attention
at
that
moment
rather
was
it
the
framing
around
the
glade
stood
a
ring
of
tall
trees
as
regular
as
if
they
had
been
planted
and
beyond
these
as
far
as
the
eye
could
penetrate
the
depths
of
the
forest
were
others
of
like
size
and
aspect
the
trunks
of
all
were
nearly
of
one
thickness
few
of
them
reaching
a
diameter
of
two
feet
but
all
rising
to
the
height
of
many
yards
without
leaf
or
branch
they
stood
somewhat
densely
over
the
ground
but
in
daylight
the
eye
might
have
ranged
to
a
considerable
distance
through
the
intervals
for
there
was
no
underwood
save
the
low
dwarf
palmetto
to
interrupt
the
view
they
were
straight
and
almost
cylindrical
as
palms
and
they
might
have
been
mistaken
for
trees
of
this
order
had
it
not
been
for
their
large
heads
of
leaves
terminating
in
summits
they
were
not
palms
they
were
pines
broom
pines
a
species
of
trees
with
which
i
was
perfectly
familiar
having
ridden
many
hundreds
of
miles
shaded
by
the
pendant
fascicles
of
their
acicular
foliage
the
sight
of
these
trees
therefore
would
have
created
no
curiosity
had
i
not
noticed
in
their
appearance
something
peculiar
instead
of
the
deep
green
which
should
have
been
exhibited
by
their
long
drooping
leaves
they
appeared
of
a
brownish
yellow
was
it
fancy
or
was
it
the
deceptive
light
of
the
moon
that
caused
this
apparent
change
from
their
natural
hue
one
or
the
other
soliloquised
i
on
first
noticing
them
but
as
i
continued
to
gaze
i
perceived
that
i
was
in
error
neither
my
own
fancy
nor
the
moon
rays
were
at
fault
the
foliage
was
really
of
the
colour
it
appeared
to
be
drawing
nearer
to
them
i
observed
that
the
leaves
were
withered
though
still
adhering
to
the
twigs
i
noticed
moreover
that
the
trunks
were
dry
and
the
bark
scaled
or
scaling
off
that
the
trees
in
short
were
dead
and
decaying
i
remembered
what
hickman
had
stated
while
groping
for
the
direction
that
was
at
some
distance
off
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
the
woods
presented
the
same
dim
colour
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
forest
was
the
inference
was
correct
and
the
explanation
easy
the
sphinx
note
had
been
at
work
the
whole
forest
was
dead
note
immense
swarms
of
insects
and
especially
the
larva
of
the
above
species
insinuate
themselves
under
the
bark
of
the
broom
pine
attack
the
trunk
and
cause
the
tree
to
perish
in
the
course
of
a
year
extensive
tracts
are
met
with
in
florida
covered
solely
with
dead
pines
that
have
been
thus
destroyed
chapter
eighty
three
a
circular
conflict
strange
as
it
may
seem
even
in
that
hour
these
observations
had
interested
me
but
while
making
them
i
observed
something
that
gratified
me
still
more
it
was
the
blue
dawn
that
mingling
with
the
yellower
light
of
the
moon
affected
the
hue
of
the
foliage
upon
which
i
had
been
gazing
morning
was
about
to
break
others
had
noticed
it
at
the
same
instant
and
already
the
sleepers
were
rising
from
their
dewy
couch
and
looking
to
the
girths
of
their
saddles
we
were
a
hungry
band
but
there
was
no
hope
of
breakfast
and
we
prepared
to
start
without
it
the
dawn
was
of
only
a
few
minutes
duration
and
as
the
sky
continued
to
brighten
preparations
were
made
for
the
start
the
sentries
were
called
in
all
except
four
who
were
prudently
left
to
the
last
minute
to
watch
in
four
different
directions
the
horses
were
unpicketed
and
bridled
they
had
worn
their
saddles
all
night
and
the
guns
of
the
party
were
carefully
or
capped
many
of
my
comrades
were
old
campaigners
and
every
precaution
was
taken
that
might
influence
our
success
in
a
conflict
it
was
expected
that
before
noon
we
should
come
up
with
the
savages
or
track
them
home
to
their
lair
in
either
case
we
should
have
a
fight
and
all
declared
their
determination
to
go
forwards
some
minutes
were
spent
in
arranging
the
order
of
our
march
it
was
deemed
prudent
that
a
few
of
the
more
skilled
of
the
men
should
go
forwards
as
scouts
on
foot
and
thoroughly
explore
the
woods
before
the
advance
of
the
main
body
this
would
secure
us
from
any
sudden
attack
in
case
the
enemy
had
formed
an
ambuscade
the
old
hunters
were
once
more
to
act
as
trackers
and
lead
the
van
these
arrangements
were
completed
and
we
were
on
the
point
of
starting
the
men
had
mounted
their
horses
the
scouts
were
already
entering
the
edge
of
the
timber
when
all
on
a
sudden
several
shots
were
heard
and
at
the
same
time
the
of
the
sentries
who
had
fired
them
the
four
had
discharged
their
pieces
almost
simultaneously
the
woods
appeared
to
ring
with
a
hundred
echoes
but
they
were
not
echoes
they
were
real
reports
of
rifles
and
musketry
and
the
shrill
that
accompanied
them
was
easily
distinguished
above
the
shouting
of
our
own
sentries
the
indians
were
upon
us
upon
us
or
to
speak
less
figuratively
us
the
sentries
had
fired
all
at
once
therefore
each
must
have
seen
indians
in
his
own
direction
but
it
needed
not
this
to
guide
us
to
the
conclusion
that
we
were
surrounded
from
all
sides
came
the
fierce
yells
of
the
foe
as
if
echoing
one
another
and
their
bullets
whistled
past
us
in
different
directions
beyond
doubt
the
glade
was
encompassed
within
their
lines
in
the
first
volley
two
or
three
men
were
hit
and
as
many
horses
but
the
balls
were
spent
and
did
but
little
damage
from
where
they
had
fired
the
glade
was
beyond
the
carry
of
their
guns
had
they
crept
a
little
nearer
before
delivering
their
fire
the
execution
would
have
been
fearful
clumped
together
as
we
were
at
the
moment
fortunately
our
sentries
had
perceived
their
approach
and
in
good
time
given
the
alarm
it
had
saved
us
there
was
a
momentary
confusion
with
noise
the
shouting
of
men
the
neighing
and
prancing
of
horses
but
above
the
din
was
heard
the
guiding
voice
of
old
hickman
off
o
yer
horses
fellers
an
take
to
the
trees
down
wi
ye
quick
to
the
trees
an
keep
back
or
by
the
tarnal
arthquake
every
mother
son
o
us
git
sculped
to
the
trees
to
the
trees
the
same
idea
had
already
suggested
itself
to
others
and
before
the
hunter
had
ceased
calling
out
the
men
were
out
of
their
saddles
and
making
for
the
edge
of
the
timber
some
ran
to
one
side
some
to
another
each
choosing
the
edge
that
was
nearest
him
and
in
a
few
seconds
our
whole
party
had
ensconced
itself
the
body
of
each
individual
sheltered
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
in
this
position
we
formed
a
perfect
circle
our
backs
turned
upon
each
other
and
our
faces
to
the
foe
our
horses
thus
hurriedly
abandoned
and
wild
with
the
excitement
of
the
attack
galloped
madly
over
the
ground
with
trailing
bridles
and
stirrups
striking
against
their
flanks
most
of
them
dashed
past
us
and
scampering
off
were
either
caught
by
the
savages
or
breaking
through
their
lines
escaped
into
the
woods
beyond
we
made
no
attempt
to
head
them
the
bullets
were
hurtling
past
our
ears
it
would
have
been
certain
death
to
have
stepped
aside
from
the
trunks
that
sheltered
us
the
advantage
of
the
position
we
had
gained
was
apparent
at
a
single
glance
fortunate
it
was
that
our
sentries
had
been
so
tardily
relieved
had
these
been
called
in
a
moment
sooner
the
surprise
would
have
been
complete
the
indians
would
have
advanced
to
the
very
edge
of
the
glade
before
uttering
their
or
firing
a
shot
and
we
should
have
been
at
their
mercy
they
would
have
been
under
cover
of
the
timber
and
perfectly
protected
from
our
guns
while
we
in
the
open
ground
must
have
fallen
before
their
fire
but
for
the
alarm
they
might
have
massacred
us
at
will
disposed
as
we
now
were
our
antagonists
had
not
much
advantage
the
trunks
of
the
trees
entrenched
us
both
only
the
concave
side
of
our
line
was
exposed
and
the
enemy
might
fire
at
it
across
the
opening
but
as
the
glade
was
fifty
yards
in
diameter
and
at
no
point
had
we
permitted
the
indians
to
get
up
to
its
edge
we
knew
that
their
bullets
could
not
carry
across
and
were
under
no
apprehension
on
this
score
the
manoeuvre
improvised
though
it
was
had
proved
our
salvation
we
now
saw
it
was
the
only
thing
we
could
have
done
to
save
ourselves
from
immediate
destruction
fortunate
it
was
that
the
voice
of
hickman
had
hurried
us
so
quickly
to
our
posts
our
men
were
not
slow
in
returning
the
enemy
fire
already
their
pieces
were
at
play
and
every
now
and
then
was
heard
the
sharp
spang
of
the
rifles
around
the
circle
of
the
glade
at
intervals
too
came
a
triumphant
cheer
as
some
savage
who
had
too
rashly
exposed
his
red
body
was
known
to
have
fallen
to
the
shot
again
the
voice
of
the
old
hunter
rang
over
the
glade
cool
calm
and
clear
it
was
heard
by
every
one
mind
yer
hind
sights
boys
an
shoot
sure
do
waste
neer
a
grain
o
yer
powder
ye
need
the
hul
o
afore
we
done
wi
the
cussed
niggers
do
a
one
o
ye
pull
trigger
till
ye
drawed
a
bead
on
a
red
skin
these
injunctions
were
full
of
significance
hitherto
the
younger
hands
had
been
firing
somewhat
recklessly
discharging
their
pieces
as
soon
as
loaded
and
only
wounding
the
trunks
of
the
trees
it
was
to
stay
this
proceeding
that
hickman
had
spoken
his
words
produced
the
desired
effect
the
reports
became
less
frequent
but
the
triumphant
cheer
that
betokened
a
hit
was
heard
as
often
as
ever
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
first
burst
of
the
battle
the
conflict
had
assumed
altogether
a
new
aspect
the
wild
yells
uttered
by
the
indians
in
their
first
onslaught
intended
to
frighten
us
into
confusion
were
no
longer
heard
and
the
shouts
of
the
white
men
had
also
ceased
only
now
and
then
were
heard
the
deep
hurrah
of
triumph
or
a
word
spoken
by
some
of
our
party
to
give
encouragement
to
his
comrades
at
long
intervals
only
rang
out
the
uttered
by
some
warrior
chief
to
stimulate
his
braves
to
the
attack
the
shots
were
no
longer
in
volleys
but
single
or
two
or
three
at
a
time
every
shot
was
fired
with
an
aim
and
it
was
only
when
that
aim
proved
true
or
he
who
fired
it
believed
it
so
that
voices
broke
out
on
either
side
each
individual
was
too
much
occupied
in
looking
for
an
object
for
his
aim
to
waste
time
in
idle
words
or
shouts
perhaps
in
the
whole
history
of
war
there
is
no
account
of
a
conflict
so
quietly
carried
on
no
battle
so
silently
fought
in
the
interludes
between
the
shots
there
were
moments
when
the
stillness
was
intense
moments
of
perfect
but
ominous
silence
neither
was
battle
ever
fought
in
which
both
sides
were
so
oddly
arrayed
against
each
other
we
were
disposed
in
two
concentric
circles
the
outer
one
formed
by
the
enemy
the
inner
by
the
men
of
our
party
deployed
almost
regularly
around
the
glade
these
circles
were
scarce
forty
paces
apart
at
some
points
perhaps
a
little
less
where
a
few
of
the
more
daring
warriors
sheltered
by
the
trees
had
worked
themselves
closer
to
our
line
never
was
battle
fought
where
the
contending
parties
were
so
near
each
other
without
closing
in
conflict
we
could
have
conversed
with
our
antagonists
without
raising
our
voices
above
the
ordinary
tone
and
were
enabled
to
aim
literally
at
the
whites
of
their
eyes
under
such
circumstances
was
the
contest
carried
on
chapter
eighty
four
a
dead
shot
by
jake
for
fall
two
hours
this
singular
conflict
was
continued
without
any
material
change
in
the
disposition
of
the
combatants
now
and
then
an
odd
man
might
be
seen
darting
from
tree
to
tree
with
a
velocity
as
if
projected
from
a
howitzer
his
object
either
to
find
a
trunk
that
would
afford
better
cover
to
his
own
body
or
a
point
that
would
uncover
the
body
or
a
portion
of
it
of
some
marked
antagonist
the
trunks
were
barely
thick
enough
to
screen
us
some
kept
on
their
feet
taking
the
precaution
to
make
themselves
as
small
as
possible
by
standing
rigidly
erect
and
keeping
their
bodies
carefully
aligned
others
perceiving
that
the
pines
bulged
a
little
at
the
roots
had
thrown
themselves
flat
upon
their
faces
and
in
this
attitude
continued
to
load
and
fire
the
sun
was
long
since
ascending
the
heavens
for
it
had
been
near
sunrise
when
the
conflict
began
there
was
no
obscurity
to
hide
either
party
from
the
view
of
the
other
though
in
this
the
indians
had
a
slight
advantage
on
account
of
the
opening
in
our
rear
but
even
in
the
depth
of
the
forest
there
was
light
enough
for
our
purpose
many
of
the
dead
fascicles
had
fallen
the
ground
was
deeply
bedded
with
them
and
those
that
still
drooped
overhead
formed
but
a
gauzy
screen
against
the
brilliant
beams
of
the
sun
there
was
light
sufficient
to
enable
our
marksmen
to
sight
any
object
as
large
as
a
dollar
piece
that
chanced
to
be
within
range
of
their
rifles
a
hand
a
portion
of
an
arm
a
leg
badly
aligned
a
jaw
bone
projecting
outside
the
bark
a
pair
of
shoulders
too
brawny
for
the
trunk
that
should
have
concealed
them
even
the
outstanding
skirt
of
a
dress
was
sure
to
draw
a
shot
perhaps
two
from
one
side
or
the
other
a
man
to
have
exposed
his
full
face
for
ten
seconds
would
have
been
almost
certain
of
receiving
a
bullet
through
his
skull
for
on
both
sides
there
were
sharpshooters
thus
two
hours
had
passed
and
without
any
great
injury
received
or
inflicted
by
either
party
there
were
some
casualties
however
and
every
now
and
then
a
fresh
incident
added
to
the
number
and
kept
up
the
hostile
excitement
we
had
several
wounded
one
or
two
severely
and
one
man
killed
the
latter
was
a
favourite
with
our
men
and
his
death
strengthened
their
desire
for
vengeance
the
indian
loss
must
have
been
greater
we
had
seen
several
fall
to
our
shots
in
our
party
were
some
of
the
best
marksmen
in
florida
hickman
was
heard
to
declare
he
had
drawed
a
bead
upon
three
and
wherever
he
drawed
his
bead
he
was
sartin
to
put
his
bullet
weatherford
had
shot
his
man
killing
him
on
the
spot
this
was
beyond
conjecture
for
the
dead
body
of
the
savage
could
be
seen
lying
between
two
trees
where
it
had
fallen
his
comrades
feared
that
in
dragging
it
away
they
might
expose
themselves
to
that
terrible
rifle
the
indians
had
not
yet
learned
that
refinement
of
civilised
warriors
who
seek
from
their
opponents
a
temporary
truce
in
which
to
pay
an
empty
compliment
to
the
dead
while
with
cunning
eye
and
wary
step
they
seize
the
opportunity
to
scrutinise
where
to
make
the
most
effectual
onslaught
upon
the
living
after
a
time
the
indians
began
to
practise
a
chapter
of
tactics
which
proved
that
in
this
mode
of
warfare
they
were
our
superiors
instead
of
one
two
of
them
would
place
themselves
behind
a
tree
or
two
trees
that
stood
close
together
and
as
soon
as
one
fired
the
other
was
ready
to
take
aim
of
course
the
man
at
whom
the
first
shot
had
been
discharged
fancying
his
now
carried
an
empty
gun
would
be
less
careful
about
his
person
and
likely
enough
to
expose
it
this
proved
to
be
the
case
for
before
the
bit
of
craft
was
discovered
several
of
our
men
received
wounds
and
one
man
of
our
number
was
shot
dead
by
his
tree
this
ruse
freshly
exasperated
our
men
the
more
so
that
they
could
not
reciprocate
the
strategy
since
our
numbers
were
not
sufficient
to
have
taken
post
by
twos
it
would
have
thinned
our
line
so
that
we
could
not
have
defended
the
position
we
were
compelled
therefore
to
remain
as
we
were
more
careful
not
to
expose
ourselves
to
the
cunning
fence
of
our
enemies
there
was
one
case
however
in
which
the
savages
were
paid
back
in
their
own
coin
black
jake
and
i
were
partners
in
this
we
occupied
two
trees
almost
close
together
and
had
for
antagonists
no
less
than
three
savages
who
had
been
all
the
morning
most
active
in
firing
at
us
i
had
received
one
of
their
bullets
through
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
and
jake
had
the
dandruff
driven
out
of
his
wool
but
neither
of
us
had
been
wounded
during
the
contest
i
had
got
sight
upon
one
and
fancied
i
had
spilled
his
blood
i
could
not
be
certain
however
as
the
three
were
well
sheltered
behind
a
clump
of
trees
and
covered
also
by
a
thicket
of
dwarf
palmettoes
one
of
these
indians
jake
wished
particularly
to
kill
he
was
a
huge
savage
much
larger
than
either
of
the
others
he
wore
a
of
king
vulture
plumes
and
was
otherwise
distinguished
by
his
costume
in
all
probability
a
chief
what
was
most
peculiar
in
this
appearance
was
his
face
for
we
could
see
it
at
intervals
though
only
for
an
instant
at
a
time
it
was
covered
all
over
with
a
scarlet
pigment
vermilion
it
was
and
shone
through
the
trees
like
a
counterpart
of
the
sun
it
was
not
this
however
that
had
rendered
the
indian
an
object
of
jake
vengeance
the
cause
was
different
the
savage
had
noticed
jake
peculiar
colour
and
had
taunted
him
with
it
several
times
during
the
fray
he
spoke
in
his
native
tongue
but
jake
comprehended
it
well
enough
he
was
spited
exasperated
and
vowed
vengeance
against
the
scarlet
chief
i
contrived
at
length
to
give
him
an
opportunity
cunningly
adjusting
my
cap
so
that
it
appeared
to
contain
my
head
i
caused
it
to
protrude
a
little
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
it
was
an
old
and
ruse
but
for
all
that
in
jake
phraseology
it
fooled
the
indian
the
red
countenance
appeared
above
the
palmettoes
a
puff
of
smoke
rose
from
below
it
the
cap
was
jerked
out
of
my
hand
as
i
heard
the
report
of
the
shot
that
had
done
it
a
little
after
i
heard
another
crack
louder
and
nearer
the
report
of
the
negro
piece
i
peeped
around
the
tree
to
witness
the
effect
a
spot
of
darker
red
dappled
the
bright
disk
of
the
indian
face
the
vermilion
seemed
suddenly
encrimsoned
it
was
but
a
glance
i
had
for
in
the
next
instant
the
painted
savage
doubled
back
among
the
bushes
during
all
the
time
we
had
been
engaged
the
indians
did
not
appear
desirous
of
advancing
upon
us
although
certainly
they
were
superior
to
us
in
point
of
numbers
the
party
we
had
been
pursuing
must
have
been
joined
by
another
one
as
numerous
as
itself
not
less
than
a
hundred
were
now
upon
the
ground
and
had
been
so
from
the
beginning
of
the
fight
but
for
this
accession
they
would
hardly
have
dared
to
attack
us
and
but
for
it
we
should
have
charged
them
at
once
and
tried
the
chances
of
a
conflict
we
had
seen
however
that
they
far
outnumbered
us
and
were
content
to
hold
our
position
they
appeared
satisfied
with
theirs
though
by
closing
rapidly
inwards
they
might
have
overpowered
us
after
all
their
ranks
would
have
been
smartly
thinned
before
reaching
our
line
and
some
of
their
best
men
would
have
fallen
no
men
calculate
such
chances
more
carefully
than
indians
and
perhaps
none
are
inferior
to
them
in
charging
a
foe
that
is
entrenched
the
weakest
fort
even
the
most
flimsy
stockade
can
be
easily
defended
against
the
red
warriors
of
the
west
their
intention
having
been
foiled
by
the
failure
of
their
first
charge
they
appeared
not
to
contemplate
another
contented
to
hold
us
in
siege
for
to
that
situation
were
we
in
reality
reduced
after
a
time
their
firing
became
less
frequent
until
it
nearly
ceased
altogether
but
we
knew
that
this
did
not
indicate
any
intention
to
retreat
on
the
contrary
we
saw
some
of
them
kindling
fires
afar
off
in
the
woods
no
doubt
with
the
design
of
cooking
their
breakfasts
there
was
not
a
man
among
us
who
did
not
envy
them
their
occupation
chapter
eighty
five
a
meagre
meal
to
us
the
partial
armistice
was
of
no
advantage
we
dared
not
stir
from
the
trees
men
were
athirst
and
water
within
sight
the
pond
glittering
in
the
centre
of
the
glade
better
there
had
been
none
since
they
dared
not
approach
it
it
only
served
to
tantalise
them
the
indians
were
seen
to
eat
without
leaving
their
lines
a
few
waited
on
the
rest
and
brought
them
food
from
the
fires
women
were
observed
passing
backwards
and
forwards
almost
within
range
of
our
guns
we
were
all
of
us
hungry
as
famished
wolves
we
had
been
hours
without
tasting
food
even
longer
than
that
and
the
sight
of
our
enemies
feasting
before
our
very
faces
gave
a
keen
edge
to
our
appetites
at
the
same
time
rekindling
our
indignation
they
even
taunted
us
on
our
starving
condition
old
hickman
had
grown
furious
he
was
heard
to
declare
that
he
war
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
indyen
raw
if
he
could
git
his
teeth
upon
one
and
he
looked
as
if
he
would
have
carried
but

continued

it
ar
it
is
a
bare
place
indeed
where
such
men
as
hickman
and
weatherford
will
not
find
resources
and
the
energies
of
both
were
now
bent
upon
discovery
they
were
seen
scratching
among
the
dead
needles
of
the
pines
that
as
already
stated
formed
a
thick
layer
over
the
surface
of
the
ground
of
what
were
they
in
search
worms
grubs
larvae
or
lizards
one
might
have
fancied
so
but
no
it
had
not
come
to
that
hungry
as
they
were
they
were
not
yet
ready
to
feed
upon
the
a
better
resource
had
suggested
itself
to
them
and
shortly
after
an
exclamation
of
joy
announced
that
they
had
discovered
the
object
of
their
search
hickman
was
seen
holding
up
a
brownish
coloured
mass
of
conical
form
somewhat
resembling
a
large
pineapple
it
was
a
cone
of
the
broom
pine
easily
recognisable
by
its
size
and
shape
now
fellers
shouted
he
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
all
around
the
glade
jest
gather
a
wheen
o
these
hyar
and
break
open
ye
find
kurnels
inside
o
that
aint
bad
chawin
they
aint
equal
to
hog
an
hominy
but
we
hant
got
hog
an
hominy
and
these
hyar
sarve
in
a
pinch
i
ef
ye
only
root
among
the
rubbage
aroun
ye
ye
scare
up
a
wheen
jest
try
it
the
suggestion
was
eagerly
adopted
and
in
an
instant
all
hands
were
seen
scratching
up
the
dead
leaves
in
search
of
pine
cones
some
of
these
were
found
lying
upon
the
surface
near
at
hand
and
were
easily
procured
while
others
were
jerked
within
reach
by
ramrods
or
the
barrels
of
rifles
less
or
more
every
one
was
enabled
to
obtain
a
supply
the
cones
were
quickly
cut
open
and
the
kernels
greedily
devoured
it
was
by
no
means
an
inferior
food
for
the
seeds
of
the
broom
pine
are
both
nutritive
and
pleasant
to
the
palate
their
quality
gave
universal
satisfaction
it
was
only
in
quantity
they
were
deficient
for
there
was
not
enough
of
them
within
reach
to
stay
the
cravings
of
fifty
stomachs
hungry
as
ours
were
there
was
some
joking
over
this
dry
breakfast
and
the
more
reckless
of
the
party
laughed
while
they
ate
as
though
it
had
been
a
nutting
frolic
but
the
laughter
was
our
situation
was
too
serious
to
admit
of
much
levity
it
was
an
interval
while
the
firing
of
the
enemy
had
slackened
almost
ceased
and
we
had
ample
time
to
consider
the
perils
of
our
position
up
to
this
time
it
had
not
occurred
to
us
that
in
reality
we
were
the
hurried
excitement
of
the
conflict
had
left
us
no
time
for
reflection
we
only
looked
upon
the
affair
as
a
skirmish
that
must
soon
come
to
an
end
by
one
side
or
the
other
proving
victorious
the
contest
no
longer
wore
that
look
it
had
assumed
the
aspect
of
a
regular
siege
we
were
encompassed
on
every
side
shut
up
as
if
in
a
fortress
but
not
half
so
secure
our
only
stockade
was
the
circle
of
standing
trees
and
we
had
no
blockhouse
to
retire
to
no
shelter
in
the
event
of
being
wounded
each
man
was
a
sentry
with
a
of
guard
duty
that
must
be
continual
our
situation
was
indeed
perilous
in
the
extreme
there
was
no
prospect
of
escape
our
horses
had
all
galloped
off
long
since
one
only
remained
lying
dead
by
the
side
of
the
pond
it
had
been
killed
by
a
bullet
but
it
was
not
from
the
enemy
hickman
had
fired
the
shot
i
saw
him
and
wondered
at
the
time
what
could
be
his
object
the
hunter
had
his
reasons
but
it
was
only
afterwards
i
learned
them
we
could
hold
our
ground
against
five
times
our
number
almost
any
odds
but
how
about
food
thirst
we
did
not
fear
at
night
we
should
have
relief
under
the
cover
of
night
we
could
approach
the
pond
one
after
another
we
had
no
apprehension
from
want
of
water
but
how
about
food
the
cones
we
had
gathered
were
but
a
bite
there
were
no
more
within
reach
we
must
yield
to
hunger
to
famine
we
conversed
with
one
another
freely
as
if
face
to
face
we
canvassed
our
prospects
they
were
gloomy
enough
how
was
the
affair
to
end
how
were
we
to
be
delivered
from
our
perilous
situation
these
were
the
questions
that
occupied
the
thoughts
of
all
we
could
think
of
only
one
plan
that
offered
a
plausible
chance
of
escape
and
that
was
to
hold
our
position
until
nightfall
make
a
sally
in
the
darkness
and
fight
our
way
through
the
lines
of
our
foes
it
would
be
running
the
gauntlet
a
few
of
us
would
certainly
fall
perhaps
many
but
some
would
escape
to
stay
where
we
were
would
be
to
expose
our
whole
party
to
certain
sacrifice
there
was
no
likelihood
of
our
being
rescued
by
others
no
one
entertained
such
a
hope
as
soon
as
hunger
overcame
us
we
should
be
massacred
to
a
man
rather
than
patiently
abide
such
a
fate
we
resolved
while
yet
strong
to
risk
all
chances
and
fight
our
way
through
the
enemy
line
darkness
would
favour
the
attempt
and
thus
resolved
we
awaited
the
going
down
of
the
sun
chapter
eighty
six
a
bullet
from
behind
if
we
thought
the
time
long
it
was
not
from
want
of
occupation
during
the
day
the
indians
at
intervals
renewed
their
attack
and
notwithstanding
all
our
vigilance
we
had
another
man
killed
and
several
slightly
wounded
in
these
skirmishes
the
savages
showed
a
determination
to
get
nearer
our
line
by
making
their
advances
from
tree
to
tree
we
perfectly
understood
their
object
in
this
it
was
not
that
they
had
any
design
of
closing
with
us
though
their
numbers
might
have
justified
them
in
doing
so
they
were
now
far
more
numerous
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
another
fresh
band
had
arrived
upon
the
ground
for
we
had
heard
the
shouts
of
welcome
that
hailed
their
coming
but
even
with
this
accession
of
strength
they
did
not
design
to
come
to
the
encounter
of
sharp
weapons
their
purpose
in
advancing
was
different
they
had
perceived
that
by
getting
close
to
our
convex
line
they
would
be
near
enough
to
fire
upon
those
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
glade
who
of
course
were
then
exposed
to
their
aim
to
prevent
this
therefore
became
our
chief
object
and
anxiety
and
it
was
necessary
to
redouble
our
vigilance
we
did
so
regarding
with
scrutinous
glances
the
trunks
behind
which
we
knew
the
savages
were
skulking
and
eyeing
them
as
keenly
as
the
ferret
hunter
watches
the
burrows
of
the
warren
they
had
but
slight
success
in
their
endeavours
to
advance
it
cost
them
several
of
their
boldest
men
for
the
moment
one
of
them
essayed
to
rush
forwards
the
cracks
of
three
or
four
rifles
could
be
heard
and
one
of
these
was
sure
to
deliver
its
messenger
of
death
the
indians
soon
became
tired
of
attempting
this
dangerous
manoeuvre
and
as
evening
approached
appeared
to
give
up
their
design
and
content
themselves
by
holding
us
in
siege
we
were
glad
when
the
sun
set
and
the
twilight
came
on
it
would
soon
pass
and
we
should
be
able
to
reach
the
water
the
men
were
maddened
with
thirst
for
they
had
been
suffering
from
it
throughout
the
whole
day
during
the
daylight
many
would
have
gone
to
the
pond
had
they
not
been
restrained
by
the
precepts
of
the
more
prudent
and
perhaps
more
effectually
by
an
example
of
which
they
had
all
been
witnesses
one
more
reckless
than
the
rest
had
risked
the
attempt
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
water
drank
to
satisfaction
and
was
hastening
back
to
his
post
when
a
shot
from
the
savages
stretched
him
dead
upon
the
sward
he
was
the
man
last
killed
and
his
lifeless
body
now
lay
in
the
open
ground
before
the
eyes
of
his
comrades
it
proved
a
warning
to
all
for
despite
the
torture
of
thirst
no
one
cared
to
repeat
the
rash
experiment
at
length
the
welcome
darkness
descended
only
a
glimmer
of
grey
light
lingered
in
the
leaden
sky
men
in
twos
and
threes
were
now
seen
approaching
the
pond
like
spectres
they
moved
silently
gliding
over
the
open
ground
but
in
stooping
attitudes
and
heads
bent
eagerly
forwards
in
the
direction
of
the
water
we
did
not
all
go
at
once
though
all
were
alike
eager
to
quench
their
thirst
but
the
admonitions
of
the
old
hunter
had
their
effect
and
the
more
continent
agreed
to
bear
their
pangs
a
little
longer
and
wait
till
the
others
should
get
back
to
their
posts
it
was
prudent
we
so
acted
for
at
this
crisis
the
indians
no
doubt
suspecting
what
was
going
forward
renewed
their
fire
with
fresh
energy
whole
volleys
were
discharged
inwards
and
without
aim
the
darkness
must
have
hindered
an
aim
but
for
all
that
the
bullets
buzzed
past
our
ears
as
thickly
as
hornets
upon
their
flight
there
was
a
cry
raised
that
the
enemy
was
closing
upon
us
and
those
who
had
gone
to
the
water
rushed
rapidly
back
some
even
without
staying
to
take
the
much
desired
drink
during
all
this
time
i
had
remained
behind
my
tree
my
black
follower
had
also
stuck
to
his
post
like
a
faithful
sentinel
as
he
was
we
talked
of
relieving
one
another
by
turns
jake
insisted
that
i
should
drink
first
i
had
partially
consented
to
this
arrangement
when
the
fire
of
the
enemy
suddenly
reopened
like
others
we
were
apprehensive
that
the
savages
were
about
to
advance
and
we
knew
the
necessity
of
keeping
them
back
we
agreed
to
keep
our
ground
for
a
little
longer
i
had
one
eye
round
the
trunk
of
the
tree
with
my
rifle
raised
to
the
level
and
was
watching
for
a
flash
from
the
gun
of
some
savage
to
guide
me
in
my
aim
when
all
on
a
sudden
i
felt
my
arm
jerked
upwards
and
my
gun
shaken
out
of
my
grasp
there
was
no
mystery
about
it
a
bullet
had
passed
through
my
arm
piercing
the
muscles
that
upheld
it
i
had
shown
too
much
of
my
shoulder
and
was
wounded
nothing
more
my
first
thought
was
to
look
to
my
wound
i
felt
it
distinctly
enough
and
that
enabled
me
to
discover
the
place
i
saw
that
the
ball
had
passed
through
the
upper
part
of
my
right
arm
just
below
the
shoulder
and
in
its
further
progress
had
creased
the
breast
of
my
uniform
coat
where
its
trace
was
visible
in
the
torn
cloth
there
was
still
light
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
make
these
observations
and
furthermore
that
a
thick
stream
of
blood
was
gushing
from
the
wound
i
commenced
unbuttoning
my
coat
the
better
to
get
at
the
wound
the
black
was
ready
by
my
side
rending
his
shirt
into
ribbons
all
at
once
i
heard
him
uttering
an
exclamation
of
surprise
followed
by
the
words
gorramighty
mass
george
dat
shot
come
from
ahind
from
behind
i
shouted
echoing
his
words
and
once
more
looking
to
the
wound
yes
mass
yes
sartin
he
come
from
ahind
some
suspicion
of
this
had
already
been
in
my
thoughts
i
fancied
that
i
had
the
shot
from
that
quarter
it
had
been
no
fancy
on
a
more
minute
examination
of
the
wound
and
the
torn
traces
upon
the
breast
of
my
coat
the
direction
of
the
bullet
was
plainly
perceived
undoubtedly
it
had
struck
me
from
behind
good
god
jake
i
exclaimed
it
is
so
the
indians
have
advanced
to
the
other
side
of
the
glade
we
are
lost
under
this
belief
we
both
faced
towards
the
opening
when
at
that
moment
as
if
to
confirm
us
another
bullet
whistled
past
our
ears
and
struck
with
a
heavy
thud
into
the
tree
by
which
we
were
kneeling
this
one
had
certainly
been
fired
from
the
other
side
of
the
glade
we
saw
the
flash
and
heard
the
report
of
the
gun
that
had
sent
it
what
had
become
of
our
comrades
on
that
side
had
they
abandoned
their
posts
and
permitted
the
indians
to
advance
were
they
all
by
the
pond
and
thus
neglecting
their
duty
these
were
the
first
conjectures
both
of
my
companion
and
myself
it
was
too
dark
for
us
to
see
our
men
under
the
shadows
of
the
pines
but
neither
did
they
appear
in
the
open
ground
we
were
puzzled
and
shouted
aloud
for
an
explanation
if
there
were
replies
we
heard
them
not
for
at
that
moment
a
wild
yell
from
our
savage
enemies
drowned
all
other
cries
and
a
sight
burst
upon
our
eyes
that
caused
the
blood
to
curdle
within
our
veins
directly
in
point
of
the
position
that
jake
and
i
held
and
close
to
the
indian
line
a
red
flame
was
seen
suddenly
springing
up
from
the
earth
it
rose
in
successive
puffs
each
leaping
higher
and
higher
until
it
had
ascended
among
the
tops
of
the
trees
it
resembled
the
flashes
of
large
masses
of
gunpowder
ignited
upon
the
ground
and
such
in
reality
it
was
we
read
the
intention
at
a
glance
the
indians
were
attempting
to
fire
the
forest
their
success
was
almost
instantaneous
as
soon
as
the
sulphureous
blaze
came
in
contact
with
the
withered
fascicles
of
foliage
the
latter
caught
as
though
they
had
been
tinder
and
with
the
velocity
of
projected
rockets
the
flames
shot
out
in
different
directions
and
danced
far
above
the
tops
of
the
tree
we
looked
around
on
all
sides
we
beheld
a
similar
spectacle
that
wild
yell
had
been
the
signal
for
a
circle
of
fires
the
glade
was
encompassed
by
a
wall
of
flame
red
roaring
and
gigantic
the
whole
forest
was
on
fire
from
all
points
the
flame
appeared
closing
inwards
sweeping
the
trees
as
if
they
had
been
withered
grass
and
leaping
in
long
spurts
high
into
the
heavens
the
smoke
now
came
thick
and
heavy
around
us
each
moment
growing
denser
as
the
fire
approached
while
the
heated
atmosphere
was
no
longer
endurable
already
it
stifled
our
breathing
destruction
stared
us
in
the
face
and
men
shouted
in
despair
but
the
roar
of
the
burning
pines
drowned
their
voices
and
one
could
not
hear
even
his
comrade
who
was
nearest
their
looks
were
significant
for
before
the
smoke
fell
the
glade
was
lit
up
with
intense
brilliance
and
we
could
see
one
another
with
unnatural
distinctness
in
the
faces
of
all
appeared
the
anxiety
of
awe
not
long
continued
i
to
share
it
too
much
blood
had
escaped
from
my
neglected
wound
i
tried
to
make
into
the
open
ground
as
i
saw
others
doing
but
before
i
got
two
steps
from
the
tree
my
limbs
tottered
beneath
me
and
i
fell
fainting
to
the
earth
chapter
eighty
seven
a
jury
amid
the
fire
i
had
a
last
thought
as
i
fell
it
was
that
my
life
had
reached
its
termination
that
in
a
few
seconds
my
body
would
be
embraced
by
the
flames
and
i
should
horribly
perish
the
thought
drew
from
me
a
feeble
scream
and
with
that
scream
my
consciousness
forsook
me
i
was
as
senseless
as
if
dead
indeed
so
far
as
sensibility
went
i
dead
and
had
the
flames
at
that
moment
swept
over
me
i
should
not
have
felt
them
in
all
probability
i
might
have
been
burned
to
a
cinder
without
further
pain
during
the
interval
of
my
unconsciousness
i
had
neither
dream
nor
apparition
by
this
i
knew
that
my
soul
must
have
forsaken
its
earthly
tenement
it
may
have
been
hovering
above
or
around
but
it
was
no
longer
within
me
it
had
separated
from
my
senses
that
were
all
dead
dead
but
capable
of
being
restored
to
life
and
haply
a
restorative
was
at
hand
with
one
capable
to
administer
it
when
my
soul
returned
the
first
perception
i
had
was
that
i
was
up
to
my
neck
in
water
i
was
in
the
pond
and
in
a
recumbent
position
my
limbs
and
body
under
the
water
with
only
my
head
above
the
surface
resting
against
the
bank
a
man
was
kneeling
over
me
himself
half
immersed
my
returning
senses
soon
enabled
me
to
tell
who
the
man
was
my
faithful
jake
he
had
my
pulse
in
his
hand
and
was
gazing
into
my
features
with
silent
earnestness
as
my
open
eyes
replied
to
his
gaze
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
the
words
golly
massa
george
you
lib
thank
be
to
gorramighty
you
lib
keep
up
ya
heart
young
massa
you
a
gwine
to
git
ober
it
sartin
your
a
gwine
to
git
ober
it
i
hope
so
jake
was
my
reply
in
a
weak
voice
but
feeble
though
it
was
it
roused
the
faithful
fellow
into
a
transport
of
delight
and
he
continued
to
utter
his
cheering
ejaculations
i
was
able
to
raise
my
head
and
look
around
it
was
a
dread
spectacle
that
on
all
sides
greeted
my
eyes
and
there
was
plenty
of
light
wherewith
to
view
it
the
forest
was
still
on
fire
burning
with
a
continued
roar
as
of
thunder
or
a
mighty
wind
varied
with
hissing
noises
and
loud
crackling
that
resembled
the
platoon
firing
of
musketry
one
might
have
fancied
it
a
fusilade
from
the
indians
but
that
was
impossible
they
must
have
long
since
retreated
before
the
spreading
circle
of
that
conflagration
there
was
less
flame
than
when
i
had
last
looked
upon
it
and
less
smoke
in
the
atmosphere
the
dry
foliage
had
been
suddenly
reduced
to
a
cinder
and
the
twiggy
fragments
had
fallen
to
the
earth
where
they
lay
in
a
dense
bed
of
glowing
embers
out
of
this
rose
the
tall
trunks
half
stripped
of
their
branches
and
all
on
fire
the
crisp
scaling
bark
had
caught
freely
and
the
resinous
sapwood
was
readily
yielding
to
the
flames
many
had
burned
far
inwards
and
looked
like
huge
columns
of
iron
heated
to
redness
the
spectacle
presented
an
aspect
of
the
infernal
world
the
sense
of
feeling
too
might
have
suggested
fancies
of
the
same
region
the
heat
was
intense
to
an
extreme
degree
the
atmosphere
quivered
with
the
drifting
caloric
the
hair
had
crisped
upon
our
heads
our
skins
had
the
feel
of
blistering
and
the
air
we
inhaled
resembled
steam
from
the
pipe
of
an
engine
instinctively
i
looked
for
my
companions
a
group
of
a
dozen
or
more
were
upon
the
open
ground
near
the
edge
of
the
pond
but
these
were
not
all
there
should
have
been
nearer
fifty
where
were
the
others
had
they
perished
in
the
flames
where
were
they
mechanically
i
put
the
question
to
jake
thar
massa
he
replied
pointing
downwards
tha
dey
be
safe
yet
ebbery
one
ob
un
i
blieve
i
looked
across
the
surface
of
the
pond
three
dozen
roundish
objects
met
my
glance
they
were
the
heads
of
my
companions
like
myself
their
bodies
were
submerged
most
of
them
to
the
neck
they
had
thus
placed
themselves
to
shun
the
smoke
as
well
as
the
broiling
heat
but
the
others
they
on
the
bank
why
had
they
not
also
availed
themselves
of
this
cunning
precaution
why
were
they
still
standing
exposed
to
the
fierce
heat
and
amid
the
drifting
clouds
of
smoke
the
latter
had
grown
thin
and
the
forms
of
the
men
were
seen
distinctly
through
it
magnified
as
in
a
mist
like
giants
they
were
striding
over
the
ground
and
the
guns
in
their
hands
appeared
of
colossal
proportions
their
gestures
were
abrupt
and
their
whole
bearing
showed
they
were
in
a
state
of
half
frenzied
excitement
it
was
natural
enough
amidst
the
circumstances
that
surrounded
them
i
saw
they
were
the
principal
men
of
our
party
i
saw
hickman
and
weatherford
both
gesticulating
freely
among
them
no
doubt
they
were
counselling
how
we
should
act
this
was
the
conjecture
i
derived
from
my
first
glance
but
a
further
survey
of
the
group
convinced
me
i
was
in
error
it
was
no
deliberation
about
our
future
plans
in
the
lull
between
the
volleys
of
the
crackling
pines
i
could
hear
their
voices
they
were
those
of
men
engaged
in
angry
dispute
the
voices
of
hickman
and
weatherford
especially
reached
my
ear
and
i
perceived
they
were
talking
in
a
tone
that
betokened
a
high
state
of
indignation
at
this
moment
the
smoke
drifting
aside
discovered
a
group
still
further
from
the
edge
of
the
pond
there
were
six
men
standing
in
threes
and
i
perceived
that
the
middle
man
of
each
three
was
tightly
grasped
by
the
two
others
two
of
them
were
prisoners
were
they
indians
two
of
our
enemies
who
amid
the
confusion
of
the
fire
had
strayed
into
the
glade
and
been
captured
it
was
my
first
thought
but
at
that
instant
a
jet
of
flame
shooting
upwards
filled
the
glade
with
a
flood
of
brilliant
light
the
little
group
thus
illuminated
could
be
seen
as
distinctly
as
by
the
light
of
day
i
was
no
longer
in
doubt
about
the
captives
their
faces
were
before
me
white
and
ghastly
as
if
with
fear
even
the
red
light
failed
to
tinge
them
with
its
colour
but
wan
as
they
were
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
them
they
were
spence
and
williams
chapter
eighty
eight
quick
executioners
i
turned
to
the
black
for
an
explanation
but
before
he
could
make
reply
to
my
interrogatory
i
more
than
half
comprehended
the
situation
my
own
plight
admonished
me
i
remembered
my
wound
i
remembered
that
i
had
received
it
from
i
remembered
that
the
bullet
that
struck
the
tree
came
from
the
same
quarter
i
thought
we
had
been
indebted
to
the
savages
for
the
shots
but
no
worse
savages
spence
and
williams
were
the
men
who
had
fired
them
the
reflection
was
awful
the
motive
mysterious
and
now
returned
to
my
thoughts
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
night
the
conduct
of
these
two
fellows
in
the
forest
the
suspicious
hints
thrown
out
by
old
hickman
and
his
comrades
and
far
beyond
the
preceding
night
other
circumstances
well
marked
upon
my
memory
rose
freshly
before
me
here
again
was
the
hand
of
arens
ringgold
o
god
to
think
that
this
dar
only
a
tryin

to
the
interrogatory
i
had
put

i
asked
mechanically

i
already
knew

dat
what
tha

doin
with
strange
interest
i
once
more
turned
my
eyes
outward
and
gazed
first
at
one
group
then
the
other
the
fire
was
now
making
less
noise
the
sapwood
having
nearly
burnt
out
and
the
detonations
caused
by
the
escape
of
the
pent
gases
from
the
cellular
cavities
of
the
wood
had
grown
less
frequent
voices
could
be
heard
over
the
glade
those
of
the
improvised
jury
i
listened
attentively
i
perceived
that
a
dispute
was
still
raging
between
them
they
were
not
agreed
upon
their
verdict
some
advocating
the
immediate
death
of
the
prisoners
while
others
adverse
to
such
prompt
punishment
would
have
kept
them
for
further
inquiry
there
were
some
who
could
not
credit
their
guilt
the
deed
was
too
atrocious
and
hence
improbable
under
what
motive
could
they
have
committed
it
at
such
a
time
too
with
their
own
lives
in
direst
jeopardy
a
bit

exclaimed
hickman
in

some
one
made
reply
i
did
not
hear
what
was
said
but
the
voice
of
the
hunter
again
sounded
distinct
and
clear
ye
palaver
about
thar
motive
i
you
mean
thar
reezuns
for
sech
bloody
bizness
them
i
acknullidge

i

but
do
you
really
say
you
saw
them
take
aim
in
that
direction
are
you
sure
of
that
this
inquiry
was
put
by
a
tall
man
who
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
disputing
party
a
man
of
advanced
age
and
of
somewhat
severe
aspect
i
knew
him
as
one
of
our
neighbours
in
the
settlement
an
extensive
planter
who
had
some
intercourse
with
my
uncle
and
out
of
friendship
for
our
family
had
joined
the
pursuit
sure
echoed
the
old
hunter
with
emphasis
and
not
without
some
show
of
indignation
did
me
an
jim
weatherford
see
wi
our
own
two
eyes
an
thar
good
enough
i
reckin
to
mark
sich
varmints
as
them
we
been
a
watchin
all
day
for
we
knowd
thar
war
somethin
ugly
afoot
we
seed
both
fire
acrost
the
gleed
an
sight
at
young
randolph
besides
the
black
himself
sez
that
the
two
shots
comed
that
away
what
more
proof
kin
you
want
at
this
moment
i
heard
a
voice
by
my
side
it
was
that
of
jake
calling
out
to
the
crowd
mass
hickman
cried
he
if
dey
want
more
proof
i
dis
nigger
can
gib
it
one
ob
de
bullets
miss
young
an
stuck
in
da
tree
yonner
the
verry
tree
itself
that
we
wa
behind
it
ai
burn
yet
it
no
take
fire
maybe
you
mout
find
tha
bullet
tha
still
maybe
you
tell
what
gun
he
to
the
suggestion
was
instantly
adopted
several
men
ran
towards
the
tree
behind
which
jake
and
i
had
held
post
and
which
with
a
few
others
near
it
for
some
reason
or
other
had
escaped
the
flames
and
still
stood
with
trunks
unscathed
in
the
foreground
of
the
conflagration
jake
ran
with
the
rest
and
pointed
out
the
spot
the
bark
was
scrutinised
the
hole
found
and
the
leaden
witness
carefully
picked
out
it
was
still
in
its
globe
shape
slightly
torn
by
the
grooves
of
the
barrel
it
was
a
rifle
ballet
and
one
of
the
very
largest
size
it
was
known
that
spence
carried
a
piece
of
large
calibre
but
the
guns
of
all
the
party
were
paraded
and
their
measure
taken
the
bullet
would
enter
the
barrel
of
no
other
rifle
save
that
of
spence
the
conclusion
was
evident
the
verdict
was
no
longer
delayed
it
was
unanimous
that
the
prisoners
should
die
an
let
die
like
dogs
as
they
are
cried
hickman
indignantly
raising
his
voice
and
at
the
same
time
bringing
his
piece
to
the
level
now
jim
weatherford
look
to
yer
sights
let
go
thar
fellers
an
git
yerselves
out
o
the
way
we
gie
a
chance
for
thar
cussed
lives
they
may
take
to
yonner
trees
if
they
like
an
git
to
it
for
they
be
in
a
hotter
place
than
that
afore
long
let
go
i
let
go
i
say
or
by
the
tarnal
i
fire
into
the
middle
o
ye
the
men
who
had
hold
of
the
prisoners
perceiving
the
menacing
attitude
of
the
hunter
and
fearing
that
he
might
make
good
his
words
suddenly
dropped
their
charge
and
ran
back
towards
the
group
of
jurors
the
two
wretches
appeared
bewildered
terror
seemed
to
hold
them
speechless
and
fast
glued
to
the
spot
neither
made
any
effort
to
leave
the
ground
perhaps
the
complete
impossibility
of
escape
was
apparent
to
them
and
prostrated
all
power
to
make
the
attempt
of
course
they
could
not
have
got
away
from
the
glade
their
taking
to
the
trees
was
only
mockery
on
the
part
of
the
indignant
hunter
in
ten
seconds
they
would
have
been
roasted
among
the
blazing
branches
it
was
a
moment
of
breathless
suspense
only
one
voice
was
heard
that
of
hickman
now
jim
you
sight
spence
gie
tother
to
me
this
was
said
in
a
hurried
undertone
and
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
when
the
two
rifles
cracked
simultaneously
the
execution
was
over
the
renegades
had
ceased
to
live
this
speedy
punishment
of
convicted
rascals
is
a
severe
commentary
upon
the
more
refined
proceedings
of
our
judicial
trials
in
which
every
effort
is
made
and
every
argument
strained
to
enable
the
culprit
known
to
be
guilty
to
escape
the
punishment
due
to
his
crimes
a
result
which
is
generally
effected
either
by
some
legal
technicality
or
political
machinery
chapter
eighty
nine
an
enemy
unlooked
for
as
upon
the
stage
of
a
theatre
the
farce
follows
the
grand
melodrama
this
tragic
scene
was
succeeded
by
an
incident
ludicrous
to
an
extreme
degree
it
elicited
roars
of
laughter
from
the
men
that
under
the
circumstances
sounded
like
the
laughter
of
madmen
maniacs
indeed
might
these
men
have
been
deemed
thus
giving
way
to
mirth
with
a
prospect
before
them
so
grim
and
gloomy
the
prospect
of
almost
certain
death
either
at
the
hands
of
our
savage
assailants
or
from
starvation
of
the
former
we
had
no
present
fear
the
flames
that
had
driven
us
out
of
the
timber
had
equally
forced
them
from
their
position
and
we
knew
they
were
now
far
from
us
they
could
not
be
near
now
that
the
burnt
branches
had
fallen
from
the
pines
and
the
foliage
was
entirely
consumed
the
eye
was
enabled
to
penetrate
the
forest
to
a
great
distance
on
every
side
we
commanded
a
of
at
least
a
thousand
yards
through
the
intervals
between
the
red
glowing
trunks
and
beyond
this
we
could
hear
by
the
swiz
of
the
flames
and
the
continual
crackling
of
the
boughs
that
fresh
trees
were
being
embraced
within
the
circle
of
conflagration
that
was
each
moment
extending
its
circumference
the
sounds
grew
fainter
apace
until
they
bore
a
close
resemblance
to
the
mutterings
of
distant
thunder
we
had
fancied
that
the
fire
was
dying
out
but
the
luminous
ring
around
the
horizon
proved
that
the
flames
were
still
ascending
it
was
only
that
the
noise
came
from
a
greater
distance
that
we
heard
it
less
distinctly
our
human
foes
must
have
been
still
further
away
they
must
have
retired
before
the
widening
rim
of
the
conflagration
but
they
had
calculated
upon
doing
so
before
applying
the
torch
in
all
likelihood
they
had
retreated
to
the
savanna
to
await
the
result
their
object
in
firing
the
forest
was
not
so
easily
understood
perhaps
they
expected
that
the
vast
volume
of
flame
would
close
over
and
consume
us
or
more
like
that
we
should
be
smothered
under
the
dense
clouds
of
smoke
this
might
in
reality
have
been
our
fate
but
for
the
proximity
of
the
pond
my
companions
told
me
that
their
sufferings
from
the
smoke
had
been
dreadful
in
the
extreme
that
they
should
have
been
stifled
by
it
had
they
not
thrown
themselves
into
the
pond
and
kept
their
faces
close
to
the
surface
of
the
water
which
was
several
feet
below
the
level
of
the
ground
it
had
been
to
me
an
hour
of
unconsciousness
my
faithful
black
had
carried
me
lifeless
as
he
supposed
to
the
water
and
placed
me
among
the
rest
it
was
afterwards
when
the
smoke
had
partially
cleared
away
that
the
spies
were
brought
to
account
hickman
and
weatherford
deeply
indignant
at
the
conduct
of
these
monsters
would
not
hear
of
delay
they
insisted
upon
immediate
punishment
and
the
wretches
were
seized
upon
dragged
out
of
the
pond
and
put
upon
their
trial
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
my
senses
returned
to
me
as
soon
as
the
dread
sentence
had
been
carried
into
execution
the
jurors
came
rushing
back
to
the
pond
and
plunged
their
bodies
into
the
water
the
heat
was
still
intense
and
painful
of
endurance
there
were
two
only
who
appeared
to
disregard
it
and
still
remained
upon
the
bank
these
were
the
two
hunters
knives
in
hand
i
saw
them
stooping
over
a
dark
object
that
lay
near
it
was
the
horse
that
hickman
had
shot
in
the
morning
and
i
now
perceived
the
old
hunter
motive
that
had
hitherto
mystified
me
it
was
an
act
of
that
cunning
foresight
that
characterised
this
man
apparently
instinctive
they
proceeded
to
skin
the
horse
and
in
a
few
seconds
had
pealed
off
a
portion
of
the
hide
sufficient
for
their
purpose
they
then
cut
out
several
large
pieces
of
the
flesh
and
laid
them
aside
this
done
weatherford
stepped
off
to
the
edge
of
the
burning
timber
and
presently
returned
with
an
armful
of
half
consumed
fagots
these
were
erected
into
a
fire
near
the
edge
of
the
pond
and
the
two
squatting
down
by
its
side
commenced
broiling
the
pieces
of
upon
sapling
spits
and
conversing
as
coolly
and
cheerily
as
if
seated
in
the
chimney
corner
of
their
own
cabins
there
were
others
as
hungry
as
they
who
took
the
hint
and
proceeded
to
imitate
their
example
the
pangs
of
hunger
were
harder
to
bear
than
the
hot
atmosphere
and
in
a
few
minutes
time
a
dozen
men
might
have
been
observed
grouped
like
vultures
around
the
dead
horse
hacking
and
hewing
at
the
carcass
at
this
crisis
occurred
the
incident
which
i
have
characterised
as
ludicrous
with
the
exception
of
the
few
engaged
in
their
coarse
the
rest
of
us
remained
in
the
water
we
were
lying
around
the
circular
rim
of
the
basin
our
bodies
parallel
to
one
another
and
our
heads
upon
the
bank
we
were
not
dreaming
of
being
disturbed
by
an
intruder
of
any
kind
at
least
for
a
time
we
were
no
longer
in
fear
of
the
fire
and
our
savage
foemen
were
far
off
all
at
once
however
an
enemy
was
discovered
in
an
unexpected
quarter
right
in
the
midst
of
us
just
in
the
centre
of
the
pond
where
the
water
was
deepest
a
monstrous
form
rose
suddenly
to
the
surface
at
the
same
time
that
our
ears
were
greeted
with
a
loud
bellowing
as
if
half
a
score
of
bulls
were
let
loose
into
the
glade
in
an
instant
the
water
was
agitated
and
lashed
into
foam
and
the
spray
fell
in
showers
around
our
heads
and
sudden
as
was
the
apparition
there
was
nothing
mysterious
about
it
the
hideous
form
and
deep
barytone
were
to
all
it
was
simply
an
alligator
but
for
its
enormous
size
the
presence
of
the
reptile
would
scarce
have
been
regarded
but
it
was
one
of
the
largest
of
its
kind
its
long
body
almost
equalling
the
diameter
of
the
pond
with
huge
gaunt
jaws
that
seemed
capable
of
swallowing
a
man
at
a
single
gulp
its
roar
too
was
enough
to
inspire
even
the
boldest
with
terror
it
produced
this
effect
and
the
wild
frightened
looks
of
those
in
the
water
their
confused
plunging
and
splashing
as
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
and
hastened
to
get
out
of
it
their
simultaneous
rushing
up
the
bank
and
scattering
off
into
the
open
ground
all
contributed
to
form
a
spectacle
ludicrous
in
the
extreme
in
less
than
ten
seconds
time
the
great
saurian
had
the
pond
to
himself
where
he
continued
to
bellow
and
lash
the
water
in
his
rage
he
was
not
permitted
to
exult
long
in
his
triumph
the
hunters
with
several
others
seized
their
rifles
and
ran
forwards
to
the
edge
of
the
pond
when
a
volley
from
a
dozen
guns
terminated
the
existence
those
who
had
been
ashore
were
already
convulsed
with
laughter
at
the
scared
fugitives
but
the
latter
having
recovered
from
their
momentary
affright
now
joined
in
the
laugh
till
the
woods
rang
with
a
chorus
of
wild
cachinnations
could
the
indians
have
heard
us
at
that
moment
they
must
have
fancied
as
mad
or
more
likely
dead
and
that
our
voices
were
those
of
their
own
fiends
headed
by
wykome
himself
rejoicing
over
the
holocaust
of
their
foes
chapter
ninety
a
conflict
in
darkness
the
forest
continued
to
burn
throughout
the
night
the
following
day
and
the
night
after
even
on
the
second
day
most
of
the
trees
were
still
on
fire
they
no
longer
blazed
for
the
air
was
perfectly
still
and
there
was
no
wind
to
fan
the
fire
into
flame
it
was
seen
in
red
patches
against
the
trunks
smouldering
and
gradually
becoming
less
as
its
strength
spontaneously
died
out
from
many
of
the
trees
it
had
disappeared
altogether
and
these
no
longer
bore
any
resemblance
to
trees
but
looked
like
huge
stakes
charred
and
black
as
though
profusely
coated
with
though
there
were
portions
of
the
forest
that
might
now
have
been
traversed
there
were
other
places
where
the
fire
still
burned
fiercely
enough
to
oppose
our
progress
we
were
still
besieged
by
the
igneous
element
as
completely
confined
within
the
circumscribed
boundaries
of
the
glade
as
if
encompassed
by
a
hostile
army
of
twenty
times
our
number
indeed
more
so
no
rescue
could
possibly
reach
us
even
our
enemies
so
far
as
safety
was
concerned
could
not
have
raised
the
siege
so
far
the
old
hunter
providence
had
stood
us
in
good
stead
but
for
the
horse
some
of
us
must
have
succumbed
to
hunger
or
at
all
events
suffered
its
extreme
we
had
been
now
four
days
without
food
except
what
the
handful
of
pine
cones
and
the
afforded
us
and
still
the
fiery
forest
hemmed
us
in
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
stay
where
we
were
until
as
hickman
phrased
it
the
woods
should
git
we
were
cheered
with
the
hope
that
another
day
would
effect
this
purpose
and
we
might
travel
with
safety
the
prospect
before
us
was
gloomy
as
that
around
us
as
our
dread
of
the
fire
declined
that
of
our
human
foes
increased
in
an
inverse
proportion
we
had
but
little
hope
of
getting
off
without
an
encounter
they
could
traverse
the
woods
as
soon
as
we
and
were
certain
to
be
on
the
with
them
the
account
was
still
to
be
settled
the
gauntlet
was
yet
to
be
run
but
we
had
grown
fierce
and
less
fearful
the
greatest
coward
of
our
party
had
become
brave
and
no
one
voted
for
either
skulking
or
hanging
back
stand
or
fall
we
had
resolved
upon
keeping
together
and
cutting
our
way
through
the
hostile
lines
or
dying
in
the
attempt
it
was
but
the
old
programme
with
a
slight
change
in
the
we
waited
only
for
another
night
to
carry
our
plans
into
execution
the
woods
would
scarce
be
as
cool
as
we
might
have
desired
but
hunger
was
again
hurrying
us
the
horse
a
small
one
had
disappeared
fifty
starved
stomachs
are
hard
to
satisfy
the
bones
lay
around
clean
picked
those
that
contained
marrow
broken
into
fragments
and
emptied
of
their
contents
even
the
hideous
saurian
was
a
skeleton
a
more
disgusting
spectacle
was
presented
by
the
bodies
of
the
two
criminals
the
heat
had
swollen
them
to
enormous
proportions
and
decomposition
had
already
commenced
the
air
was
loaded
with
that
horrid
effluvia
peculiar
to
the
dead
body
of
a
human
being
our
comrades
who
fell
in
the
fight
had
been
buried
and
there
was
some
talk
of
performing
the
like
office
for
the
others
no
one
objected
but
none
volunteered
to
take
the
trouble
in
such
cases
men
are
overpowered
by
an
extreme
apathy
and
this
was
chiefly
the
reason
why
the
bodies
of
these
wretches
were
suffered
to
remain
without
interment
with
eyes
bent
anxiously
towards
the
west
we
awaited
the
going
down
of
the
sun
so
long
as
his
bright
orb
was
above
the
horizon
we
could
only
guess
at
the
condition
of
the
fire
the
darkness
would
enable
us
to
distinguish
that
part
of
the
forest
that
was
still
burning
and
point
out
the
direction
we
should
take
the
fire
itself
would
guide
us
to
the
shunning
of
it
twilight
found
us
on
the
tiptoe
of
expectation
and
not
without
hope
there
was
but
little
redness
among
the
scathed
pines
the
smoke
appeared
slighter
than
we
had
yet
observed
it
some
believed
that
the
fires
were
nearly
out
all
thought
the
time
had
arrived
when
we
could
pass
through
them
an
unexpected
circumstance
put
this
point
beyond
conjecture
while
we
stood
waiting
the
rain
began
to
fall
at
first
in
big
solitary
drops
but
in
a
few
moments
it
came
pouring
down
as
if
all
heaven
fountains
had
been
opened
together
we
hailed
the
phenomenon
with
joy
it
appeared
an
omen
in
our
favour
we
could
hardly
restrain
ourselves
from
setting
forth
at
once
but
the
more
cautious
counselled
the
rest
to
patience
and
we
stood
awaiting
the
deeper
darkness
the
rain
continued
to
pour
its
clouds
hastening
the
night
as
it
darkened
scarce
a
spark
appeared
among
the
trees
it
is
dark
enough
urged
the
impatient
the
others
yielded
and
we
started
forth
into
the
bosom
of
the
ruined
forest
we
moved
silently
along
amid
the
black
calcined
trunks
each
grasped
his
gun
tight
and
ready
for
use
mine
was
held
only
in
one
hand
the
other
rested
in
a
sling
in
this
plight
i
was
not
alone
half
a
dozen
of
my
comrades
had
been
also
winged
and
together
we
kept
in
the
rear
the
better
men
marched
in
front
hickman
and
weatherford
acting
as
guides
the
rain
beat
down
upon
us
there
was
no
longer
a
foliage
to
intercept
it
as
we
walked
under
the
burnt
branches
the
black
char
was
driven
against
our
faces
and
as
quickly
washed
off
again
most
of
the
men
were
bareheaded
their
caps
were
over
the
locks
of
their
guns
to
keep
them
dry
some
sheltered
their
priming
with
the
skirts
of
their
coats
in
this
manner
we
had
advanced
nearly
half
a
mile
we
knew
not
in
what
direction
no
guide
could
have
found
path
in
such
a
forest
we
only
endeavoured
to
keep
straight
forward
with
the
view
of
getting
our
enemies
so
long
unmolested
we
had
begun
to
hope
that
we
might
alas
it
was
a
momentary
gleam
we
were
underrating
the
cunning
of
our
red
foes
they
had
watched
us
all
the
time
had
dogged
our
steps
and
at
some
distance
off
were
marching
on
both
sides
of
us
in
two
parallel
lines
while
dreaming
of
safety
we
were
actually
in
their
midst
the
flashes
of
a
hundred
guns
through
the
misty
rain
the
whistling
of
as
many
bullets
were
the
first
intimation
we
had
of
their
presence
several
fell
under
the
volley
some
returned
the
fire
a
few
thought
only
of
making
their
escape
uttering
their
shrill
cries
the
savages
closed
in
upon
us
in
the
darkness
they
appeared
to
outnumber
the
trees
save
the
occasional
report
of
a
pistol
no
other
shot
was
heard
no
one
thought
of
reloading
the
foe
was
upon
us
before
there
was
time
to
draw
a
ramrod
the
knife
and
hatchet
were
to
be
the
arbiters
of
the
fight
the
struggle
was
sanguinary
as
it
was
short
many
of
our
brave
fellows
met
their
death
but
each
killed
his
foeman
some
two
or
three
of
them
before
he
fell
we
were
soon
vanquished
the
enemy
was
five
to
one
how
could
it
be
otherwise
they
were
fresh
and
strong
we
weak
with
hunger
almost
emaciated
many
of
us
wounded
how
could
it
be
otherwise
i
saw
but
little
of
the
conflict
perhaps
no
one
saw
more
it
was
a
straggle
amidst
opaque
darkness
with
my
one
hand
and
that
the
left
i
was
almost
helpless
i
fired
my
rifle
at
random
and
had
contrived
to
draw
a
pistol
but
the
blow
of
a
tomahawk
hindered
me
from
using
it
at
the
same
time
felling
me
senseless
to
the
earth
i
was
only
stunned
and
when
my
senses
returned
to
me
i
saw
that
the
conflict
was
over
dark
as
it
was
i
could
perceive
a
number
of
black
objects
lying
near
me
upon
the
ground
they
were
the
bodies
of
the
slain
some
were
those
of
my
late
comrades
others
their
foes
in
many
instances
locked
in
each
other
embrace
the
savages
were
stooping
over
as
if
separating
them
on
the
former
they
were
executing
their
last
hideous
rite
of
vengeance
they
were
scalping
them
a
group
was
nearer
the
individuals
composing
it
were
standing
erect
one
in
their
midst
appeared
to
issue
commands
even
in
the
grey
light
i
could
distinguish
three
waving
plumes
again
osceola
i
was
not
free
or
at
that
moment
i
should
have
rushed
forwards
and
grappled
him
vain
though
the
vengeful
effort
might
have
been
but
i
was
not
free
two
savages
knelt
over
me
as
if
guarding
me
against
such
an
attempt
i
perceived
my
black
follower
near
at
hand
still
alive
and
similarly
cared
for
why
had
they
not
killed
us
at
this
moment
a
man
was
seen
approaching
it
was
not
he
with
the
though
the
latter
appeared
to
have
sent
him
as
he
drew
near
i
perceived
that
he
carried
a
pistol
my
hour
was
come
the
man
stooped
over
me
and
placed
the
weapon
close
to
my
ear
to
my
astonishment
he
fired
it
into
the
air
i
thought
he
had
missed
me
and
would
try
again
but
this
was
not
his
purpose
he
only
wanted
a
light
while
the
powder
was
ablaze
i
caught
a
glance
of
the
countenance
it
was
an
indian
but
i
thought
i
had
seen
it
before
and
from
some
expression
the
man
made
use
of
he
appeared
to
know
me
he
passed
quickly
from
me
and
proceeded
to
the
spot
where
jake
was
held
captive
the
pistol
must
have
had
two
barrels
for
i
saw
him
fire
it
again
stooping
in
the
same
manner
over
the
prostrate
form
of
the
black
he
then
rose
and
called
out
it
is
they
still
alive
this
information
appeared
meant
for
him
of
the
black
plumes
for
the
moment
it
was
given
he
uttered
some
exclamation
i
did
not
comprehend
and
then
walked
away
his
voice
produced
a
singular
impression
upon
me
i
fancied
it
did
not
sound
like
osceola
we
were
kept
upon
the
ground
only
for
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
a
number
of
horses
were
brought
up
upon
two
of
these
jake
and
i
were
mounted
and
fast
tied
to
the
saddles
a
signal
was
then
given
and
with
an
indian
riding
on
each
side
of
us
we
were
carried
off
through
the
woods
chapter
ninety
one
the
black
plumes
we
journeyed
throughout
the
whole
night
the
burnt
woods
were
left
behind
and
having
crossed
a
savanna
we
rode
for
several
hours
through
a
forest
of
giant
oaks
palms
and
magnolias
i
knew
this
by
the
fragrance
of
the
magnolia
blossoms
that
after
the
fetid
atmosphere
that
we
had
been
breathing
smelt
sweet
and
refreshing
just
as
day
was
breaking
we
arrived
at
an
opening
in
the
woods
where
our
captors
halted
the
opening
was
of
small
extent
a
few
acres
only
bounded
on
all
sides
by
a
thick
forest
of
palms
magnolias
and
their
foliage
drooped
to
the
ground
so
that
the
glade
appeared
encompassed
by
a
vast
wall
of
green
through
which
no
outlet
was
discernible
through
the
grey
light
i
perceived
the
outlines
of
an
encampment
there
were
two
or
three
tents
with
horses
picketed
around
them
and
human
forms
some
of
them
upright
and
moving
about
others
recumbent
upon
the
grass
singly
or
in
clusters
as
if
sleeping
together
for
mutual
warmth
a
large
fire
was
burning
in
the
midst
and
around
it
were
men
and
women
seated
and
standing
within
the
limits
of
this
camp
we
had
been
carried
but
no
time
was
left
us
for
observation
the
moment
we
halted
we
were
dragged
roughly
from
our
horses
and
flung
prostrate
upon
the
grass
we
were
next
turned
upon
our
backs
thongs
were
tied
around
our
waists
and
ancles
our
arms
and
limbs
drawn
out
to
their
full
extent
and
we
were
staked
firmly
to
the
ground
like
hides
spread
out
for
drying
of
course
in
this
attitude
we
could
see
no
more
of
the
camp
nor
the
trees
nor
the
earth
itself
only
the
blue
heavens
above
us
under
any
circumstances
the
position
would
have
been
painful
but
my
wounded
arm
rendered
it
excruciating
our
arrival
had
set
the
camp
in
motion
men
came
out
to
meet
us
and
women
stooped
over
us
as
we
lay
on
our
backs
there
were
indian
squaws
among
them
but
to
my
surprise
i
noticed
that
most
of
them
were
of
african
race
mulattoes
samboes
and
negresses
for
some
time
they
stood
over
jeering
and
taunting
us
they
even
proceeded
to
inflict
torture
they
spit
on
us
pulled
out
handfuls
of
our
hair
by
the
roots
and
stuck
sharp
thorns
into
our
skin
all
the
while
yelling
with
a
fiendish
delight
and
jabbering
an
unintelligible
patois
that
appeared
a
mixture
of
spanish
and
yamassee
my
fared
as
badly
as
myself
the
homogenous
colour
of
his
skin
elicited
no
sympathy
from
these
female
fiends
black
and
white
were
alike
the
victims
of
their
hellish
spite
part
of
their
jargon
i
was
able
to
comprehend
aided
by
a
slight
acquaintance
with
the
spanish
tongue
i
made
out
what
was
intended
to
be
done
with
us
we
were
to
be
we
had
been
brought
to
the
camp
to
be
we
were
to
be
the
victims
of
a
grand
spectacle
and
these
infernal
hags
were
exulting
in
the
prospect
of
the
sport
our
sufferings
should
afford
them
for
this
only
had
we
been
instead
of
being
into
whose
hound
hands
had
we
fallen
were
they
human
beings
were
they
indians
could
they
be
seminoles
whose
behaviour
to
their
captives
hitherto
had
repelled
every
insinuation
of
torture
a
shout
arose
as
if
in
answer
to
my
questions
the
voices
of
all
around
were
mingled
in
the
cry
but
the
words
were
the
same
viva
the
trampling
of
many
hoofs
announced
the
arrival
of
a
band
they
were
the
warriors
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
fight
who
had
conquered
and
made
us
captive
only
half
a
dozen
guards
had
been
with
us
on
the
and
had
reached
the
camp
at
daybreak
the
new
comers
were
the
main
body
who
had
stayed
upon
the
field
to
complete
the
despoliation
of
their
fallen
foes
i
could
not
see
them
though
they
were
near
for
i
heard
their
horses
trampling
around
i
lay
listening
to
that
significant
shout
viva
to
me
the
words
were
full
of
terrible
import
the
phrase
was
not
new
to
me
and
i
heard
it
with
a
feeling
of
dread
but
it
was
scarce
possible
to
increase
apprehensions
already
excited
to
the
full
a
hard
fate
was
before
me
the
presence
of
the
fiend
himself
could
not
make
it
more
certain
my
shared
my
thoughts
we
were
near
and
could
converse
on
comparing
our
conjectures
we
found
that
they
coincided
but
the
point
was
soon
settled
beyond
conjecture
a
harsh
voice
sounded
in
our
ears
issuing
an
abrupt
order
that
scattered
the
women
away
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
behind
the
speaker
was
approaching
in
another
instant
his
shadow
fell
upon
my
face
and
the
man
himself
stood
within
the
limited
circle
of
my
vision
despite
the
pigment
that
disguised
his
natural
complexion
despite
the
beaded
shirt
the
sash
the
embroidered
leggins
despite
the
black
that
waved
over
his
brow
i
easily
identified
the
man
he
was
no
indian
but
a
mulatto
yellow
jake
himself
chapter
ninety
two
buried
alive
i
had
expected
the
man
the
cry
and
afterwards
his
voice
still
well
remembered
had
warned
me
of
his
coming
i
expected
to
gaze
upon
him
with
dread
strange
it
may
seem
but
such
was
not
the
case
on
the
contrary
i
beheld
him
with
a
feeling
akin
to
joy
joy
at
the
sight
of
three
blade
that
nodded
above
his
scowling
temples
for
a
moment
i
marked
not
his
angry
frowns
nor
the
wicked
triumph
that
sparkled
in
his
eye
the
ostrich
feathers
were
alone
the
objects
of
my
regard
the
cynosure
of
my
thoughts
their
presence
upon
the
crest
of
the
mulatto
king
elucidated
a
world
of
mystery
foul
suspicion
was
plucked
from
out
my
bosom
the
preserver
of
my
life
the
hero
of
my
heart
admiration
was
still
true
osceola
was
true
in
the
momentary
exultation
of
this
thought
i
almost
forgot
the
gloom
of
my
situation
but
soon
the
voice
of
the
mulatto
once
more
roused
me
to
a
consciousness
of
its
peril
cried
he
in
a
tone
of
malignant
triumph
fin
at
last
vengeance
both
too
white
and
black
master
and
slave
my
young
tyrant
and
my
rival
ha
ha
ha
me
tie
to
tree
continued
he
after
a
burst
of
hoarse
laughter
me
burn
eh
burn
your
turn
come
now
trees
plenty
here
but
no
me
teach
you
better
plan
far
better
plan
tie

tree
captive
sometime
ha
ha
ha
before
burn
me
show
you
sight
ho
there
he
shouted
motioning
to
some
of
the
bystanders
to
come
near
untie
hands
raise
up
both
faces
turn
to
camp
that
do
now
white
rascal
black
rascal
look
what
see
yonder
as
he
issued
these
orders
several
of
his
creatures
pulled
up
the
stakes
that
had
picketed
down
our
arms
and
raised
us
into
a
sitting
posture
our
bodies
slewed
round
till
our
faces
bore
full
upon
the
camp
it
was
broad
daylight
the
sun
shining
brightly
in
the
heavens
under
such
a
light
every
object
in
the
camp
was
distinctly
visible
the
tents
the
horses
the
motley
crowd
of
human
occupants
we
regarded
not
these
on
two
forms
alone
our
eyes
rested
they
were
my
sister
and
viola
they
were
close
together
as
i
had
seen
them
once
before
viola
seated
with
her
head
drooping
while
that
of
virginia
rested
in
her
lap
the
hair
of
both
was
hanging
in
dishevelled
masses
the
black
tresses
of
the
maid
mingling
with
the
golden
locks
of
her
mistress
they
were
surrounded
by
guards
and
appeared
unconscious
of
our
presence
but
one
was
dispatched
to
warn
them
as
the
messenger
reached
them
we
saw
them
both
start
and
look
inquiringly
abroad
in
another
instant
their
eyes
were
upon
us
a
thrilling
scream
announced
that
we
were
recognised
they
cried
out
together
i
heard
my
sister
voice
pronouncing
my
name
i
called
to
her
in
return
i
saw
her
spring
to
her
feet
toss
her
arms
wildly
above
her
head
and
attempt
to
rush
towards
me
i
saw
the
guards
taking
hold
of
her
and
rudely
dragging
her
back
oh
it
was
a
painful
sight
death
itself
could
not
have
been
so
hard
to
endure
but
we
were
allowed
to
look
upon
them
no
longer
suddenly
jerked
upon
our
backs
our
wrists
were
once
more
staked
down
and
we
lay
in
our
former
recumbent
attitudes
painful
as
were
our
reflections
we
were
not
allowed
to
indulge
in
them
alone
the
monster
continued
to
stand
over
us
taunting
us
with
spiteful
words
and
worse
than
all
gross
allusions
to
my
sister
and
viola
oh
it
was
horrible
to
bear
molten
lead
poured
into
our
ears
could
scarce
have
tortured
us
more
it
was
almost
a
relief
when
he
desisted
from
speech
and
we
saw
him
commence
making
preparations
for
our
torture
we
knew
that
the
hour
was
nigh
for
he
had
himself
said
so
as
he
issued
the
orders
to
his
fellows
some
horrible
mode
of
death
had
been
promised
but
what
it
was
we
were
yet
in
ignorance
not
long
did
we
remain
so
several
men
were
seen
approaching
the
spot
with
spades
and
pickaxes
in
their
hands
they
were
negroes
old
and
knew
how
to
use
such
implements
they
stopped
near
us
and
commenced
digging
the
ground
o
god
were
we
to
be
buried
alive
this
was
the
conjecture
that
first
suggested
itself
if
true
it
was
terrible
enough
but
it
was
not
true
we
were
designed
to
undergo
a
still
more
horrible
fate
silently
and
with
the
solemn
air
of
the
men
worked
on
the
mulatto
stood
over
directing
them
he
was
in
high
glee
occasionally
calling
to
us
in
mockery
and
boasting
how
skillfully
he
should
perform
the
office
of
executioner
the
women
and
savage
warriors
clustered
around
laughing
at
his
sallies
or
contributing
their
quota
of
grotesque
wit
at
which
they
uttered
yells
of
demoniac
laughter
we
might
easily
have
fancied
ourselves
in
the
infernal
regions
in
the
middle
of
a
crowd
of
jibbering
fiends
who
stood
grinning
down
upon
us
as
if
they
drew
delight
from
our
anguish
we
noticed
that
few
of
the
men
were
seminoles
indians
there
were
but
these
were
of
dark
complexion
nearly
black
they
were
of
the
tribe
of
yamassees
a
race
conquered
by
the
seminoles
and
partially
engrafted
into
their
nation
but
most
of
those
we
saw
were
black
negroes
samboes
and
mulattoes
descendants
of
spanish
maroons
or
runaways
from
the
american
plantations
there
were
many
of
the
latter
for
i
could
hear
english
spoken
among
them
no
doubt
there
were
some
of
my
own
slaves
mixing
with
the
motley
crew
though
none
of
them
came
near
and
i
could
only
note
the
faces
of
those
who
stood
over
me
in
about
half
an
hour
the
diggers
had
finished
their
work
our
stakes
were
drawn
and
we
were
dragged
forwards
to
the
spot
where
they
had
been
engaged
as
soon
as
i
was
raised
up
i
bent
my
eyes
upon
the
camp
but
my
sister
was
no
longer
there
viola
too
was
gone
they
had
been
taken
either
inside
the
tents
or
back
among
the
bushes
i
was
glad
they
were
not
there
they
would
be
spared
this
pang
of
a
horrid
spectacle
though
it
was
not
likely
that
from
any
such
motive
the
monster
had
removed
them
two
dark
holes
yawned
before
us
deeply
dug
into
the
earth
they
were
not
graves
or
if
so
it
was
not
intended
our
bodies
should
be
placed
vertically
in
them
if
their
shape
was
peculiar
so
too
was
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
made
we
were
soon
to
become
acquainted
with
it
we
were
conduced
to
the
edge
of
the
cavities
seized
by
the
shoulders
and
each
of
us
plunged
into
the
one
that
was
nearest
they
proved
just
deep
enough
to
bring
our
throats
on
a
level
with
the
surface
while
standing
erect
the
loose
earth
was
then
shovelled
in
and
kneaded
firmly
around
us
more
was
added
until
our
shoulders
were
covered
up
and
only
our
heads
appeared
above
ground
the
position
was
ludicrous
enough
and
we
might
have
laughed
ourselves
but
that
we
were
standing
in
our
graves
from
the
fiendish
spectators
it
drew
yells
of
laughter
what
next
was
this
to
be
the
end
of
their
proceedings
were
we
to
be
thus
left
to
perish
miserably
and
by
inches
hunger
and
thirst
would
in
time
terminate
our
existence
but
oh
the
long
hours
of
anguish
that
must
be
endured
whole
days
of
misery
we
must
suffer
before
the
spark
of
life
should
forsake
us
whole
days
of
horror
and
ha
they
had
not
yet
done
with
us
no
a
death
like
that
we
had
been
fancying
appeared
too
easy
to
the
monster
who
directed
them
the
resources
of
his
hatred
were
far
from
being
exhausted
he
had
still
other
and
far
keener
torture
in
store
for
us
carajo
good
cried
he
as
he
stood
admiring
his
contrivance
better
than
tie
to
tree
good
fix
eh
no
fear
no
bring
fire
it
was
to
be
fire
then
the
extreme
instrument
of
torture
we
heard
the
word
that
word
of
fearful
sound
we
were
to
die
by
fire
our
terror
had
arrived
at
its
height
it
rose
no
higher
when
we
saw
fagots
carried
up
to
the
spot
and
built
in
a
ring
around
our
heads
it
rose
no
higher
when
we
saw
the
torch
applied
and
the
dry
wood
catching
the
flame
it
rose
no
higher
as
the
blaze
grew
red
and
redder
and
we
felt
its
angry
glow
upon
our
skulls
soon
to
be
calcined
like
the
sticks
themselves
no
we
could
suffer
no
more
our
agony
had
reached
the
acme
of
endurance
and
we
longed
for
death
to
relieve
us
if
another
pang
had
been
possible
there
was
cause
for
it
in
those
screams
now
proceeding
from
the
opposite
edge
of
the
camp
even
in
that
dread
hour
we
could
recognise
the
voices
of
my
sister
and
viola
the
unmerciful
monster
had
brought
them
out
again
to
witness
the
execution
we
saw
them
not
but
their
wild
plaints
proved
that
they
were
spectators
of
the
horrid
scene
hotter
and
hotter
grew
the
fire
and
nearer
licked
the
flames
i
heard
my
hair
crisping
and
singing
at
the
fiery
contact
objects
swam
dizzily
before
my
eyes
the
trees
tottered
and
reeled
the
earth
whirled
round
my
skull
ached
as
if
it
would
soon
split
my
brain
was
drying
up
my
senses
were
fast
forsaking
me

exquisite
pleasure
imparted

their
touch

may
look
upon
your
face
and

you

it
was
and
not
her
spirit
it
was

herself
whose
beautiful
brilliant
eyes
were
looking
into
mine
no
wonder
i
had
believed
it
to
be
an
angel
carajo
sounded
a
voice
that
appeared
hoarse
with
rage
remove
those
women
pile
back
the
fires
away
mad
queen
go
back
to
your
tribe
these
my
captives

pile

yamassees
cried
advancing
towards
the
indians
obey
him
not
or
dread
the
wrath
of
wykome
his
spirit
will
be
angry
and
follow
you
in
vengeance
wherever
you
go
the
will
be
on
your
path
and
its
rattle
in
your
ears
it
will
bite
your
heel
as
you
wander
in
the
woods
speak
i
not
truth
thou
king
of
the
serpents
as
she
uttered
the
interrogatory
she
raised
the
rattlesnake
in
her
hands
holding
it
so
that
it
might
be
distinctly
seen
by
those
whom
she
addressed
the
reptile
hissed
accompanying
the
sibilation
with
a
sharp
skirr
of
its
tail
who
could
doubt
that
it
was
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
not
the
yamassees
who
stood
and
trembling
in
the
presence
of
the
mighty
sorceress
and
you
black
runaways
and
renegades
she
continued
to
the
negro
allies
you
who
have
no
god
and
fear
not
wykome
dare
to
rebuild
the
fires
dare
to
lift
one
fagot
and
you
shall
take
the
place
of
your
captives
a
greater
than
yon
yellow
monster
your
chief
will
soon
be
on
the
ground
ho
yonder
the
rising
sun
he
comes
he
comes
as
she
ceased
speaking
the
of
a
horse
echoed
through
the
glade
and
a
hundred
voices
simultaneously
raised
the
shout
osceola
osceola
that
cry
was
grateful
to
my
ears
though
already
rescued
i
had
begun
to
fear
it
might
prove
only
a
short
relief
our
delivery
from
death
was
still
far
from
certain
our
advocates
were
but
weak
women
the
mulatto
king
in
the
midst
of
his
fierce
satellites
would
scarce
have
yielded
to
their
demands
alike
disregarded
would
have
been
their
entreaties
the
fire
would
have
been
and
the
execution
carried
out
to
its
end
in
all
probability
this
would
have
been
the
event
had
not
osceola
in
good
time
arrived
upon
the
ground
his
appearance
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
at
once
reassured
me
under
his
protection
we
had
nothing
more
to
fear
and
a
soft
voice
whispered
in
my
ear
that
he
came
as
our
his
errand
was
soon
made
manifest
drawing
bridle
he
halted
near
the
middle
of
the
camp
directly
in
front
of
us
i
saw
him
dismount
from
his
fine
black
horse
like
himself
splendidly
caparisoned
and
handing
the
reins
to
a
bystander
he
came
walking
towards
us
his
port
was
superb
his
costume
brilliantly
picturesque
and
once
more
i
beheld
those
three
the
real
ones
that
had
played
such
a
part
in
my
suspicious
fancy
when
near
the
spot
he
stopped
and
gazed
inquiringly
towards
us
he
might
have
smiled
at
our
absurd
situation
but
his
countenance
betrayed
no
signs
of
levity
on
the
contrary
it
was
serious
and
sympathetic
i
fancied
it
was
sad
for
some
moments
he
stood
in
a
fixed
attitude
without
saying
a
word
his
eyes
wandered
from
one
to
the
other
my
and
myself
as
if
endeavouring
to
distinguish
us
no
easy
task
smoke
sweat
and
ashes
must
have
rendered
us
extremely
alike
and
both
difficult
of
identification
at
this
moment
maumee
glided
up
to
him
whispered
a
word
in
his
ear
and
returning
again
knelt
over
me
and
chafed
my
temples
with
her
soft
hands
with
the
exception
of
the
young
chief
himself
no
one
heard
what
his
sister
had
said
but
upon
her
words
appeared
to
produce
an
instantaneous
effect
a
change
passed
over
his
countenance
the
look
of
sadness
gave
place
to
one
of
furious
wrath
and
turning
suddenly
to
the
yellow
king
he
hissed
out
the
word
fiend
for
some
seconds
he
spoke
no
more
but
stood
gazing
upon
the
mulatto
as
though
he
would
annihilate
him
by
his
look
the
latter
quailed
under
the
conquering
glance
and
trembled
like
a
leaf
but
made
no
answer
fiend
and
villain
continued
osceola
without
changing
either
tone
or
attitude
is
this
the
way
you
have
carried
out
my
orders
are
these
the
captives
i
commanded
you
to
take
vile
runaway
of
a
slave
who
authorised
you
to
inflict
the
fiery
torture
who
taught
you
not
the
seminoles
whose
name
you
have
adopted
and
disgraced
by
the
spirit
of
wykome
but
that
i
have
sworn
never
to
torture
a
foe
i
should
place
you
where
these
now
stand
and
burn
your
body
to
ashes
from
my
sight
begone
no
stay
where
you
are
on
second
thoughts
i
may
need
you
and
with
this
odd
ending
to
his
speech
the
young
chief
turned
upon
his
heel
and
came
walking
towards
us
the
mulatto
did
not
vouchsafe
a
reply
though
his
looks
were
full
of
vengeance
once
during
the
flagellation
i
thought
i
noticed
him
turn
his
eyes
towards
his
ferocious
followers
as
if
to
invoke
their
interference
but
these
knew
that
osceola
was
not
alone
as
he
came
up
the
trampling
of
a
large
troop
had
been
heard
and
it
was
evident
that
his
warriors
were
in
the
woods
not
far
distant
a
single
in
the
voice
of
their
chief
would
bring
them
upon
the
ground
before
its
echoes
had
died
the
yellow
king
seemed
himself
to
be
aware
of
their
proximity
hence
it
was
that
he
replied
not
a
word
at
that
minute
might
have
proved
his
last
and
with
a
sulky
frown
upon
his
face
he
remained
silent
release
them
said
osceola
addressing
the
diggers
and
be
careful
how
you
handle
your
spades
randolph
he
continued
bending
over
me
i
fear
i
have
scarce
been
in
time
i
was
for
off
when
i
heard
of
this
and
have
ridden
hard
you
have
been
wounded
are
you
ill
hurt
i
attempted
to
express
my
gratitude
and
assure
him
i
was
not
much
injured
but
my
voice
was
so
freak
and
hoarse
as
to
be
hardly
intelligible
it
grew
stronger
however
as
those
fair
fingers
administered
the
refreshing
draught
and
we
were
soon
conversing
freely
both
of
us
were
quickly
unearthed
and
with
free
limbs
stood
once
more
upon
the
open
ground
my
first
thoughts
were
to
rush
towards
my
sister
when
to
my
surprise
i
was
restrained
by
the
chief
patience
said
he
not
yet
not
yet
maumee
will
go
and
assure
her
of
your
safety
see
she
knows
it
already
go
maumee
tell
miss
randolph
her
brother
is
safe
and
will
come
presently
but
she
must
remain
where
she
is
only
for
a
little
while
go
sister
and
cheer
her
turning
to
me
he
added
in
a
whisper
she
has
been
placed
there
for
a
purpose
you
shall
see
come
with
me
i
shall
show
you
a
spectacle
that
may
astonish
you
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
i
hear
the
signal
from
my
spies
a
minute
more
and
we
are
too
late
come
come
without
opposing
a
word
i
hastened
after
the
chief
who
walked
rapidly
towards
the
nearest
edge
of
the
woods
he
entered
the
timber
but
went
no
farther
when
fairly
under
cover
of
the
thick
foliage
he
stopped
turned
round
and
stood
facing
towards
the
camp
obedient
to
a
sign
i
imitated
his
example
chapter
ninety
four
the
end
of
arens
ringgold
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
chief
intention
or
what
was
the
nature
of
the
spectacle
i
had
been
promised
somewhat
impatient
i
questioned
him
a
new
way
of
winning
a
mistress
said
he
with
a
smile
but
who
is
the
lover
who
to
be
the
mistress
i
inquired
patience
randolph
and
you
shall
see
oh
it
is
a
rare
experiment
a
most
cunning
plot
and
would
be
laughable
were
it
not
for
the
tragedy
mixed
up
with
it
you
shall
see
but
for
a
faithful
friend
i
should
not
have
known
of
it
and
would
not
have
been
here
to
witness
it
for
my
presence
and
your
life
as
it
now
appears
more
still
perhaps
the
safety
of
your
sister
you
are
indebted
to
noble
woman
hist
they
are
near
i
hear
the
tread
of
hoofs
one
two
three
it
must
be
they
yes
yonder
see
i
looked
in
the
direction
pointed
out
a
small
party
of
horsemen
half
a
dozen
in
all
was
seen
emerging
from
the
timber
and
riding
with
a
brush
into
the
open
ground
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
uncovered
they
spurred
their
horses
to
a
gallop
and
with
loud
yells
dashed
rapidly
into
the
midst
of
the
camp
on
reaching
this
point
they
fired
their
pieces
apparently
into
the
air
and
then
continuing
their
shouts
rode
on
i
saw
that
they
were
men
and
this
surprised
me
but
what
astonished
me
still
more
was
that
i
them
at
least
i
knew
their
faces
and
recognised
the
men
as
some
of
the
most
worthless
scamps
of
our
own
settlement
a
third
surprise
awaited
me
on
looking
more
narrowly
at
their
leader
him
i
knew
well
again
it
was
arens
ringgold
i
had
not
time
to
recover
from
the
third
surprise
when
still
a
fourth
was
before
me
the
men
of
the
camp
both
negroes
and
yamassees
appeared
terrified
at
this
puny
attack
and
scattering
off
hid
themselves
in
the
bushes
they
yelled
loudly
enough
and
some
fired
their
guns
as
they
retreated
but
like
the
attacking
party
their
shots
appeared
directed
into
the
air
mystery
of
mysteries
what
could
it
mean
i
was
about
to
inquire
once
more
when
i
observed
that
my
companion
was
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
and
did
not
desire
to
be
disturbed
i
saw
that
he
was
looking
to
his
rifle
as
if
examining
the
sights
glancing
back
into
the
glade
i
saw
that
ringgold
had
advanced
close
to
where
my
sister
was
seated
and
was
just
halting
in
front
of
the
group
i
heard
him
address
her
by
name
and
pronounce
some
phrase
of
congratulation
he
appeared
about
to
dismount
with
the
design
of
approaching
her
on
foot
while
his
men
still
upon
horseback
were
galloping
through
the
camp
huzzaing
fiercely
and
firing
pistols
through
the
air
his
hour
is
come
muttered
osceola
as
he
glided
past
me
a
fate
deserved
and
long
delayed
it
is
come
at
last
and
with
these
words
he
stepped
forth
into
the
open
ground
i
saw
him
raise
his
piece
to
the
level
its
muzzle
pointed
towards
ringgold
and
the
instant
after
the
report
rang
over
the
camp
the
shrill
pealed
from
his
lips
as
the
horse
sprang
forwards
with
an
empty
saddle
and
the
rider
himself
was
seen
struggling
upon
the
grass
the
others
uttered
a
terrific
cry
and
with
fear
and
astonishment
depicted
in
their
looks
galloped
back
into
the
bushes
without
waiting
to
exchange
a
word
with
their
wounded
leader
or
a
shot
with
the
man
who
had
wounded
him
my
aim
has
not
been
true
said
osceola
with
singular
coolness
he
still
lives
i
have
received
much
wrong
from
him
and
his
ay
very
much
wrong
or
i
might
spare
his
wretched
life
but
no
my
vow
must
be
kept
he
must
die
as
he
said
this
he
rushed
after
ringgold
who
had
regained
his
feet
and
was
making
towards
the
bushes
as
with
a
hope
of
escape
a
wild
scream
came
from
the
terrified
wretch
as
he
saw
the
avenger
at
his
heels
it
was
the
last
time
his
voice
was
heard
in
a
few
bounds
osceola
was
by
his
side
the
long
blade
glittered
for
an
instant
in
the
air
and
the
downward
blow
was
given
so
rapidly
that
the
stroke
could
scarce
be
perceived
the
blow
was
instantaneously
fatal
the
knees
of
the
wounded
man
suddenly
bent
beneath
him
and
he
sank
lifeless
on
the
spot
where
he
had
been
struck
his
body
after
death
remaining
doubled
up
as
it
had
fallen
the
fourth
and
last
of
my
enemies
said
osceola
as
he
returned
to
where
i
stood
the
last
of
those
who
deserved
my
vengeance
and
against
whom
i
had
vowed
it
scott
i
inquired
he
was
the
third
he
was
killed
yesterday
and
by
this
hand
hitherto
i
have
fought
for
revenge
i
have
had
it
i
have
slain
many
of
your
people
i
have
had
full
satisfaction
and
henceforth
the
speaker
made
a
long
pause
henceforth
i
mechanically
inquired
i
care
but
little
how
soon
they
kill
me
as
osceola
uttered
these
strange
words
he
sank
down
upon
a
prostrate
trunk
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
i
saw
that
he
did
not
expect
a
reply
there
was
a
sadness
in
his
tone
as
though
some
deep
sorrow
lay
upon
his
heart
that
could
neither
be
controlled
nor
comforted
i
had
noticed
it
before
and
thinking
he
would
rather
be
left
to
himself
i
walked
silently
away
a
few
moments
after
i
held
my
dear
sister
in
my
arms
while
jake
was
comforting
viola
in
his
black
embraces
his
old
rival
was
no
longer
near
during
the
sham
attack
he
had
imitated
his
followers
and
disappeared
from
the
field
but
though
most
of
the
latter
soon
returned
the
yellow
king
when
sought
for
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
camp
his
absence
roused
the
suspicions
of
osceola
who
was
now
once
more
in
action
by
a
signal
his
warriors
were
summoned
and
came
galloping
up
several
were
instantly
dispatched
in
search
of
the
missing
chief
but
after
a
while
these
came
back
without
having
found
any
traces
of
him
one
only
seemed
to
have
discovered
a
clue
to
his
disappearance
the
followers
of
ringgold
consisted
of
only
five
men
the
indian
had
gone
for
some
distance
on
the
path
by
which
they
had
retreated
instead
of
five
there
were
six
sets
of
horse
tracks
upon
the
trail
the
report
appeared
to
produce
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
the
mind
of
osceola
fresh
scouts
were
sent
forth
with
orders
to
bring
back
the
mulatto
or
the
stern
command
proved
that
there
were
strong
doubts
about
the
fealty
of
the
yellow
chief
and
the
warriors
of
osceola
appeared
to
share
the
suspicions
of
their
leader
the
patriot
party
had
suffered
from
defections
of
late
some
of
the
smaller
clans
wearied
of
fighting
and
wasted
by
a
long
season
of
famine
had
followed
the
example
of
the
tribe
omatla
and
delivered
themselves
up
at
the
forts
though
in
the
battles
hitherto
fought
the
indians
had
generally
been
successful
they
knew
that
their
white
foemen
far
outnumbered
them
and
that
in
the
end
the
latter
must
triumph
the
spirit
of
revenge
for
wrongs
long
endured
had
stimulated
them
at
the
first
but
they
had
obtained
full
measure
of
vengeance
and
were
content
love
of
country
attachment
to
their
old
homes
mere
patriotism
was
now
balanced
against
the
dread
of
almost
complete
annihilation
the
latter
weighed
heaviest
in
the
scale
the
war
spirit
was
no
longer
in
the
ascendant
perhaps
at
this
time
had
overtures
of
peace
been
made
the
indians
would
have
laid
down
their
arms
and
consented
to
the
removal
even
osceola
could
scarce
have
prevented
their
acceptance
of
the
conditions
and
it
was
doubted
whether
he
would
have
made
the
attempt
gifted
with
genius
with
full
knowledge
of
the
strength
and
character
of
his
enemies
he
must
have
foreseen
the
disasters
that
were
yet
to
befall
his
followers
and
his
nation
it
could
not
be
otherwise
was
it
a
gloomy
forecast
of
the
future
that
imparted
to
him
that
melancholy
air
now
observable
both
in
his
words
and
acts
was
it
this
or
was
there
a
still
deeper
sorrow
the
anguish
of
a
hopeless
passion
the
drear
for
a
love
he
might
never
obtain
to
me
it
was
a
moment
of
strong
emotions
as
the
young
chief
approached
the
spot
where
my
sister
was
seated
even
then
was
i
the
victim
of
unhappy
suspicions
and
with
eager
scrutiny
i
scanned
the
countenances
of
both
surely
i
was
wrong
on
neither
could
i
detect
a
trace
of
aught
that
should
give
me
uneasiness
the
bearing
of
the
chief
was
simply
gallant
and
respectful
the
looks
of
my
sister
were
but
the
expressions
of
a
fervent
gratitude
osceola
spoke
first
i
have
to
ask
your
forgiveness
miss
randolph
for
the
scene
you
have
been
forced
to
witness
but
i
could
not
permit
this
man
to
escape
lady
he
was
your
greatest
enemy
as
he
has
been
ours
through
the
cooperation
of
the
mulatto
he
had
planned
this
ingenious
deception
with
the
design
of
inducing
you
to
become
his
wife
but
failing
in
this
the
mask
would
have
been
thrown
off
and
you
i
need
not
give
words
to
his
fool
intent
it
is
fortunate
i
arrived
in
time
brave
chief
exclaimed
virginia
twice
have
you
preserved
the
lives
of
my
brother
and
myself
more
than
our
lives
we
have
neither
words
nor
power
to
thank
you
i
can
offer
only
this
poor
token
to
prove
my
gratitude
as
she
said
this
she
advanced
towards
the
chief
and
handed
him
a
folded
parchment
which
she
had
drawn
from
her
bosom
osceola
at
once
recognised
the
document
it
was
the
title
deeds
of
his
patrimonial
estate
thanks
thanks
he
replied
while
a
sad
smile
played
over
his
features
it
is
indeed
an
act
of
disinterested
friendship
alas
it
has
come
too
late
she
who
so
much
desired
to
possess
this
precious
paper
who
so
much
longed
to
return
to
that
once
loved
home
is
no
more
my
mother
is
dead
on
yesternight
her
spirit
passed
away
it
was
news
even
to
maumee
who
bursting
into
a
wild
paroxysm
of
grief
fell
upon
the
neck
of
my
sister
their
arms
became
entwined
and
both
wept
their
tears
mingling
as
they
fell
there
was
silence
broken
only
by
the
sobbing
of
the
two
girls
and
at
intervals
the
voice
of
virginia
murmuring
words
of
consolation
osceola
himself
appeared
too
much
affected
to
speak
after
a
while
the
chief
aroused
himself
from
his
sorrowing
attitude
come
randolph
said
he
we
must
not
dwell
on
the
past
while
such
a
doubtful
future
is
before
us
you
must
go
back
to
your
home
and
rebuild
it
you
have
lost
only
a
house
your
rich
lands
still
remain
and
your
negroes
will
be
restored
to
you
i
have
given
orders
they
are
already
on
the
way
this
is
no
place
for
her
and
he
nodded
towards
virginia
you
need
not
stay
your
departure
another
moment
horses
are
ready
for
you
i
myself
will
conduct
you
to
the
borders
and
beyond
that
have
no
longer
an
enemy
to
as
he
pronounced
the
last
words
he
looked
significantly
towards
the
body
of
the
planter
still
lying
near
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
understood
his
meaning
but
made
no
reply
and
she
i
said
the
forest
is
a
rude
home
especially
in
such
times
may
with
us
my
words
had
reference
to
maumee
the
chief
grasped
my
hand
and
held
it
with
earnest
pressure
with
joy
i
beheld
gratitude
sparkling
in
his
eye
thanks
he
exclaimed
thanks
for
that
friendly
offer
it
was
the
very
favour
i
would
have
asked
you
speak
true
the
trees
must
shelter
her
no
more
randolph
i
can
trust
you
with
her
life
with
her
honour
take
her
to
your
home
chapter
ninety
five
the
death
warning
the
sun
was
going
down
as
we
took
our
departure
from
the
indian
camp
for
myself
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
direction
in
which
we
were
to
travel
but
with
such
a
guide
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
the
way
we
were
far
from
the
settlements
of
the
suwanee
a
long
day
journey
and
we
did
not
expect
to
reach
home
before
another
sun
should
set
that
night
there
would
be
moonlight
if
the
clouds
did
not
hinder
it
and
it
was
our
intention
to
travel
throughout
the
early
part
of
the
night
and
then
encamp
by
this
means
the
journey
of
would
be
shortened
to
our
guide
the
country
was
and
every
road
that
led
through
it
for
a
long
distance
the
route
conducted
through
open
woods
and
we
could
all
ride
abreast
but
the
path
grew
narrower
and
we
were
compelled
to
go
by
twos
or
in
single
file
habitually
the
young
chief
and
i
kept
in
the
advance
our
sisters
riding
close
behind
us
behind
them
came
jake
and
viola
and
in
the
rear
half
a
dozen
indian
horsemen
the
guard
of
osceola
i
wondered
he
had
not
brought
with
him
more
of
his
followers
and
even
expressed
my
surprise
he
made
light
of
the
danger
the
soldiers
he
said
knew
better
than
to
be
out
after
night
and
for
that
part
of
the
country
through
which
we
would
travel
by
daylight
no
troops
ever
strayed
into
it
besides
there
had
been
no
scouting
of
late
the
weather
was
too
hot
for
the
work
if
we
met
any
party
they
would
be
of
his
own
people
from
them
of
course
we
had
nothing
to
fear
since
the
war
began
he
had
often
travelled
most
of
the
same
route
alone
he
appeared
satisfied
there
was
no
danger
for
my
part
i
was
not
satisfied
i
knew
that
the
path
we
were
following
would
pass
within
a
few
miles
of
fort
king
i
remembered
the
escape
of
ringgold
crew
they
were
likely
enough
to
have
ridden
straight
to
the
fort
and
communicated
an
account
of
the
death
garnished
by
a
tale
of
their
own
brave
attack
upon
the
indian
camp
among
the
authorities
ringgold
was
no
common
man
a
party
might
be
organised
to
proceed
to
the
camp
we
were
on
the
very
road
to
meet
them
another
circumstance
i
thought
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
mulatto
as
was
supposed
in
company
with
these
men
it
was
enough
to
create
suspicion
i
mentioned
my
suspicion
to
the
chief
no
fear
said
he
in
reply
my
trackers
will
be
after
them
they
will
bring
me
word
in
time
but
no
he
added
hesitatingly
and
for
a
moment
appearing
thoughtful
they
may
not
get
up
with
them
before
the
night
falls
and
then
you
speak
true
randolph
i
have
acted
imprudently
i
should
not
care
for
these
foolish
fellows
but
the
mulatto
that
is
different
he
knows
all
the
paths
and
if
it
should
be
that
he
is
turning
traitor
if
it
well
we
are
astart
now
and
we
must
go
on
have
nothing
to
fear
and
as
for
me
osceola
never
yet
turned
his
back
upon
danger
and
will
not
now
nay
will
you
believe
me
randolph
i
rather
seek
it
than
otherwise
seek
danger
ay
death
death
speak
low
do
not
let
hear
you
talk
thus
ah
yes
he
added
lowering
his
tone
and
speaking
in
a
half
soliloquy
in
truth
i
long
for
its
coming
the
words
were
spoken
with
a
serious
emphasis
that
left
no
room
to
doubt
of
their
earnestness
some
deep
melancholy
had
settled
upon
his
spirit
and
preyed
upon
it
continually
what
could
be
its
cause
i
could
remain
silent
no
longer
friendship
not
curiosity
incited
me
i
put
the
inquiry
have
observed
it
then
but
not
since
we
set
out
not
since
you
made
that
friendly
offer
ah
randolph
you
have
rendered
me
happy
it
was
she
alone
that
made
the
prospect
of
death
so
gloomy
why
speak
you
of
death
because
it
is
near
not
to
you
yes
to
me
the
presentiment
is
upon
me
that
i
have
not
long
to
live
nonsense
powell
friend
it
is
true
i
have
had
my
death
warning
come
osceola
this
is
unlike
unworthy
of
you
surely
you
are
above
such
vulgar
fancies
i
will
not
believe
you
can
entertain
them
think
you
i
speak
of
supernatural
signs
of
the
screech
of
the
or
the
hooting
of
the
midnight
owl
of
omens
in
the
air
the
earth
or
the
water
no
no
i
above
such
shallow
superstitions
for
all
that
i
know
i
must
soon
die
it
was
wrong
of
me
to
call
my
death
warning
a
presentiment
it
is
a
physical
fact
that
announces
my
approaching
end
it
is
as
he
said
this
he
raised
his
hand
pointing
with
his
fingers
as
if
to
indicate
the
chest
i
understood
his
melancholy
meaning
i
would
rather
he
continued
after
a
pause
rather
it
had
been
my
fate
to
fall
upon
the
field
of
battle
true
death
is
not
alluring
in
any
shape
but
that
appears
to
me
most
preferable
i
would
choose
it
rather
than
linger
on
nay
i
have
chosen
it
ten
times
have
i
thus
challenged
death
gone
to
meet
it
but
like
a
coward
or
a
coy
bride
it
refuses
to
meet
there
was
something
almost
unearthly
in
the
laugh
that
accompanied
these
last
words
a
strange
simile
a
strange
man
i
could
scarce
make
an
effort
to
cheer
him
in
fact
he
needed
no
cheering
he
seemed
happier
than
before
had
it
not
been
so
my
poor
speech
assuring
him
of
his
robust
looks
would
have
been
words
thrown
away
he
knew
they
were
but
the
false
utterances
of
friendship
i
even
suspected
it
myself
i
had
already
noticed
the
pallid
skin
the
attenuated
fingers
the
glazed
and
sunken
eye
this
then
was
the
canker
that
was
prostrating
that
noble
spirit
the
cause
of
his
deep
melancholy
i
had
assigned
to
it
one
far
different
the
future
of
his
sister
had
been
the
heaviest
load
upon
his
heart
he
told
me
so
as
we
moved
onward
i
need
not
repeat
the
promises
i
then
made
to
him
it
was
not
necessary
they
should
be
vows
my
own
happiness
would
hinder
me
from
breaking
them
chapter
ninety
six
osceola
fate
conclusion
we
were
seated
near
the
edge
of
the
little
opening
where
we
had
encamped
a
pretty
parterre
fragrant
with
the
perfume
of
a
thousand
flowers
the
moon
was
shedding
down
a
flood
of
silvery
light
and
objects
around
appeared
almost
as
distinct
as
by
day
the
leaves
of
the
tall
palms
the
waxen
flowers
of
the
magnolias
the
yellow
blossoms
of
the
zanthoxylon
trees
could
all
be
distinguished
in
the
clear
moonbeams
the
four
of
us
were
seated
together
brothers
and
sisters
conversing
freely
as
in
the
olden
times
and
the
scene
vividly
recalled
those
times
to
all
of
us
but
the
memory
now
produced
only
sad
reflections
as
it
suggested
thoughts
of
the
future
perhaps
we
four
should
never
thus
meet
again
gazing
upon
the
doomed
form
before
me
i
had
no
heart
for
reminiscences
of
joy
we
had
passed
fort
king
in
safety
had
encountered
no
white
face
strange
i
should
fear
to
meet
men
of
my
own
race
and
no
longer
had
we
any
apprehension
of
danger
either
from
ambush
or
open
attack
the
indian
guards
with
black
jake
in
their
midst
were
near
the
centre
of
the
glade
grouped
by
a
fire
and
cooking
their
suppers
so
secure
did
the
chieftain
feel
that
he
had
not
even
placed
a
sentinel
on
the
path
he
appeared
indifferent
to
danger
the
night
was
waning
late
and
we
were
about
retiring
to
the
tents
which
the
men
had
pitched
for
us
when
a
singular
noise
reach
us
from
the
woods
to
my
ears
it
sounded
like
the
surging
of
water
as
of
heavy
rain
or
the
sough
of
distant
rapids
osceola
interpreted
it
otherwise
it
was
the
continuous
whistling
of
leaves
caused
by
numerous
bodies
passing
through
the
bushes
either
of
men
or
animals
we
instantly
rose
to
our
feet
and
stood
listening
the
noise
continued
but
now
we
could
hear
the
snapping
of
dead
branches
and
the
metallic
clink
of
weapons
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
the
noise
came
from
every
ride
a
circle
of
armed
men
were
closing
around
the
glade
i
looked
towards
osceola
i
expected
to
see
him
rush
to
his
rifle
that
lay
near
to
my
surprise
he
did
not
stir
his
few
followers
were
already
on
the
alert
and
had
hastened
to
his
side
to
receive
his
orders
their
words
and
gestures
declared
their
determination
to
die
in
his
defence
in
reply
to
their
hurried
speeches
the
chieftain
made
a
sign
that
appeared
to
astonish
them
the
butts
of
their
guns
suddenly
dropped
to
the
ground
and
the
warriors
stood
in
listless
attitudes
as
if
they
had
given
up
the
intention
of
using
them
it
is
too
late
said
osceola
in
a
calm
voice
too
late
we
are
completely
surrounded
innocent
blood
might
be
spilled
and
mine
is
the
only
life
they
are
in
search
of
let
them
come
on
they
are
welcome
to
it
now
farewell
sister
randolph
farewell
farewell
virg
the
plaintive
screams
of
maumee
of
virginia
my
own
bursting
and
no
longer
silent
grief
drowned
the
voice
that
was
uttering
those
wild
adieus
clustered
around
the
chief
we
knew
not
what
was
passing
until
the
shouts
of
men
and
the
loud
words
of
command
proceeding
from
their
officers
warned
us
that
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
battalion
of
soldiers
on
looking
up
we
saw
that
we
were
hemmed
in
by
a
circle
of
men
in
blue
uniform
whose
glancing
barrels
and
bayonets
formed
a
de
around
us
as
no
resistance
was
offered
not
a
shot
had
been
fired
and
save
the
shouting
of
men
and
the
ringing
of
steel
no
other
sounds
were
heard
shots
were
fired
afterwards
but
not
to
kill
it
was
a
to
celebrate
the
success
of
this
important
capture
the
capture
was
soon
complete
osceola
held
by
two
men
stood
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
a
prisoner
his
followers
were
also
secured
and
the
soldiers
fell
back
into
more
extended
line
the
prisoners
still
remaining
in
their
midst
at
this
moment
a
mail
appeared
in
front
of
the
ranks
and
near
to
where
the
captives
were
standing
he
was
in
conversation
with
the
officer
who
commanded
his
dress
bespoke
him
an
indian
but
his
yellow
face
contradicted
the
supposition
his
head
was
turbaned
and
three
black
plumes
drooped
over
his
brow
there
was
no
mistaking
the
man
the
sight
was
maddening
it
restored
all
his
fierce
energy
to
the
captive
chief
and
flinging
aside
the
soldiers
as
if
they
had
been
tools
he
sprang
forth
from
their
grasp
and
bounded
towards
the
yellow
man
fortunate
for
the
latter
osceola
was
unarmed
he
had
no
weapon
left
him
neither
pistol
nor
knife
and
while
wringing
a
bayonet
from
the
gun
of
a
soldier
the
traitor
found
time
to
escape
the
chief
uttered
a
groan
as
he
saw
the
mulatto
pass
through
the
serried
line
and
stand
secure
beyond
the
reach
of
his
vengeance
it
was
but
a
fancied
security
on
the
part
of
the
mulatto
the
death
of
the
renegade
was
decreed
though
it
reached
him
from
an
unexpected
quarter
as
he
stood
outside
bantering
the
captives
a
dark
form
was
seen
gliding
up
behind
him
the
form
was
that
of
a
woman
a
majestic
woman
whose
grand
beauty
was
apparent
even
in
the
moonlight
but
few
saw
either
her
or
her
beauty
the
prisoners
alone
were
facing
towards
her
and
witnessed
her
approach
it
was
a
scene
of
only
a
few
seconds
duration
the
woman
stole
close
up
to
the
mulatto
and
for
a
moment
her
arms
appeared
entwined
around
his
neck
there
was
the
sheen
of
some
object
that
in
the
moonlight
gleamed
like
metal
it
was
a
living
weapon
it
was
the
dread
its
rattle
could
be
heard
distinctly
and
close
following
came
a
wild
cry
of
terror
as
its
victim
felt
the
cold
contact
of
the
reptile
around
his
neck
and
its
sharp
fangs
entering
his
flesh
the
woman
was
seen
suddenly
to
withdraw
the
serpent
and
holding
its
glistening
body
over
her
head
she
cried
out
grieve
not
osceola
thou
art
avenged
the
chitta
mico
has
avenged
you
saying
this
she
glided
rapidly
away
and
before
the
astonished
listeners
could
intercept
her
retreat
she
had
entered
among
the
bushes
and
disappeared
the
wretch
tottered
over
the
ground
pale
and
terrified
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
men
gathered
around
and
endeavoured
to
administer
remedies
gunpowder
and
tobacco
were
tried
but
no
one
knew
the
simples
that
would
cure
him
it
proved
his
and
before
another
sun
went
down
he
had
ceased
to
live
with
osceola
capture
the
war
did
not
cease
though
i
bore
no
further
part
in
it
neither
did
it
end
with
his
death
which
followed
a
few
weeks
after
not
by
execution
for
he
was
no
rebel
and
could
claim
the
privilege
of
a
prisoner
of
war
but
of
that
disease
which
he
knew
had
long
doomed
him
captivity
may
have
hastened
the
event
his
proud
spirit
sank
under
confinement
and
with
it
the
noble
frame
that
contained
it
friends
and
enemies
stood
around
him
in
his
last
hour
and
listened
to
his
dying
words
both
alike
wept
in
that
chamber
there
was
not
a
tearless
cheek
and
many
a
soldier
eye
was
moist
as
he
listened
to
the
muffled
dram
that
made
music
over
the
grave
of
the
after
all
it
proved
to
be
the
jovial
captain
who
had
won
the
heart
of
my
capricious
sister
it
was
long
before
i
discovered
their
secret
which
let
light
in
upon
a
maze
of
mysteries
and
i
was
so
spited
about
their
having
concealed
it
from
me
that
i
almost
refused
to
share
the
plantation
with
them
when
i
did
so
at
length
under
threat
of
virginia
not
her
solicitor
i
kept
what
i
considered
the
better
half
for
myself
and
maumee
the
old
homestead
remained
ours
and
a
new
house
soon
appeared
upon
it
a
fitting
casket
for
the
jewel
it
was
destined
to
contain
i
had
still
an
to
spare
the
fine
old
spanish
clearing
on
the
tupelo
greek
i
wanted
a
man
to
manage
it
or
rather
a
man
and
wife
of
good
character
without
incumbrances
and
for
the
purpose
who
could
have
been
better
than
black
jake
and
viola
since
they
completely
answered
the
above
conditions
i
had
another
freehold
at
my
disposal
a
very
small
one
it
was
situated
by
the
edge
of
the
swamp
and
consisted
of
a
log
cabin
with
the
most
circumscribed
of
all
clearings
around
it
but
this
was
already
in
possession
of
a
tenant
whom
although
he
paid
no
rent
i
would
not
have
ejected
for
the
world
he
was
an
old
of
the
name
of
hickman
another
of
like
kidney
weatherford
by
name
lived
near
on
an
adjoining
plantation
but
the
two
were
oftener
together
than
apart
both
had
suffered
a
good
deal
of
rough
handling
in
their
time
from
the
claws
of
bars
the
jaws
and
tails
of
alligators
and
the
tomahawk
of
indians
when
together
or
among
friends
they
were
delighted
to
narrate
their
escapes
and
both
were
often
heard
to
declare
that
the
toughest
scrape
they
ever
come
clar
out
o
wor
when
they
wor
on
a
surrounded
by
a
burnin
forest
o
broom
pines
about
ten
thousand
red
indyuns
they
did
come
clear
out
of
it
however
and
lived
long
after
to
tell
the
tale
with
many
a
fanciful
exaggeration
the
end
