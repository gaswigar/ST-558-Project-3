the
spirit
of
the
age
jeremy
bentham
bentham
is
one
of
those
persons
who
verify
the
old
adage
that
a
prophet
has
no
honour
except
out
of
his
own
country
his
reputation
lies
at
the
circumference
and
the
lights
of
his
understanding
are
reflected
with
increasing
lustre
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
his
name
is
little
known
in
england
better
in
europe
best
of
all
in
the
plains
of
chili
and
the
mines
of
mexico
he
has
offered
constitutions
for
the
new
world
and
legislated
for
future
times
the
people
of
westminster
where
he
lives
hardly
know
of
such
a
person
but
the
siberian
savage
has
received
cold
comfort
from
his
lunar
aspect
and
may
say
to
him
with
caliban
i
know
thee
and
thy
dog
and
thy
bush
the
tawny
indian
may
hold
out
the
hand
of
fellowship
to
him
across
the
great
pacific
we
believe
that
the
empress
catherine
corresponded
with
him
and
we
know
that
the
emperor
alexander
called
upon
him
and
presented
him
with
his
miniature
in
a
gold
which
the
philosopher
to
his
eternal
honour
returned
hobhouse
is
a
greater
man
at
the
hustings
lord
rolle
at
plymouth
dock
but
bentham
would
carry
it
hollow
on
the
score
of
popularity
at
paris
or
pegu
the
reason
is
that
our
author
influence
is
purely
intellectual
he
has
devoted
his
life
to
the
pursuit
of
abstract
and
general
truths
and
to
those
studies
that
waft
a
from
indus
to
the
pole
and
has
never
mixed
himself
up
with
personal
intrigues
or
party
politics
he
once
indeed
stuck
up
a
to
say
that
he
jeremy
bentham
being
of
sound
mind
was
of
opinion
that
sir
samuel
romilly
was
the
most
proper
person
to
represent
westminster
but
this
was
the
whim
of
the
moment
otherwise
his
reasonings
if
true
at
all
are
true
everywhere
alike
his
speculations
concern
humanity
at
large
and
are
not
confined
to
the
hundred
or
the
bills
of
mortality
it
is
in
moral
as
in
physical
magnitude
the
little
is
seen
best
near
the
great
appears
in
its
proper
dimensions
only
from
a
more
commanding
point
of
view
and
gains
strength
with
time
and
elevation
from
distance
bentham
is
very
much
among
philosophers
what
la
fontaine
was
among
poets
in
general
habits
and
in
all
but
his
professional
pursuits
he
is
a
mere
child
he
has
lived
for
the
last
forty
years
in
a
house
in
westminster
overlooking
the
park
like
an
anchoret
in
his
cell
reducing
law
to
a
system
and
the
mind
of
man
to
a
machine
he
scarcely
ever
goes
out
and
sees
very
little
company
the
favoured
few
who
have
the
privilege
of
the
are
always
admitted
one
by
one
he
does
not
like
to
have
witnesses
to
his
conversation
he
talks
a
great
deal
and
listens
to
nothing
but
facts
when
any
one
calls
upon
him
he
invites
them
to
take
a
turn
round
his
garden
with
him
bentham
is
an
economist
of
his
time
and
sets
apart
this
portion
of
it
to
air
and
exercise
and
there
you
may
see
the
lively
old
man
his
mind
still
buoyant
with
thought
and
with
the
prospect
of
futurity
in
eager
conversation
with
some
opposition
member
some
expatriated
patriot
or
transatlantic
adventurer
urging
the
extinction
of
close
boroughs
or
planning
a
code
of
laws
for
some
lone
island
in
the
watery
waste
his
walk
almost
amounting
to
a
run
his
tongue
keeping
pace
with
it
in
shrill
cluttering
accents
negligent
of
his
person
his
dress
and
his
manner
intent
only
on
his
grand
theme
of
utility
or
pausing
perhaps
for
want
of
breath
and
with
eye
to
point
out
to
the
stranger
a
stone
in
the
wall
at
the
end
of
his
garden
overarched
by
two
beautiful
to
the
prince
of
which
marks
the
house
where
milton
formerly
lived
to
shew
how
little
the
refinements
of
taste
or
fancy
enter
into
our
author
system
he
proposed
at
one
time
to
cut
down
these
beautiful
trees
to
convert
the
garden
where
he
had
breathed
the
air
of
truth
and
heaven
for
near
half
a
century
into
a
paltry
and
to
make
house
the
cradle
of
paradise
lost
a
thoroughfare
like
a
stable
for
the
idle
rabble
of
westminster
to
pass
backwards
and
forwards
to
it
with
their
cloven
hoofs
let
us
not
however
be
getting
on
too
fast
milton
himself
taught
school
there
is
something
not
altogether
dissimilar
between
bentham
appearance
and
the
portraits
of
milton
the
same
silvery
tone
a
few
dishevelled
hairs
a
peevish
yet
puritanical
expression
an
irritable
temperament
corrected
by
habit
and
discipline
or
in
modern
times
he
is
something
between
franklin
and
charles
fox
with
the
comfortable
and
sleek
thriving
look
of
the
one
and
the
quivering
lip
the
restless
eye
and
animated
acuteness
of
the
other
his
eye
is
quick
and
lively
but
it
glances
not
from
object
to
object
but
from
thought
to
thought
he
is
evidently
a
man
occupied
with
some
train
of
fine
and
inward
association
he
regards
the
people
about
him
no
more
than
the
flies
of
a
summer
he
meditates
the
coming
age
he
hears
and
sees
only
what
suits
his
purpose
or
some
foregone
conclusion
and
looks
out
for
facts
and
passing
occurrences
in
order
to
put
them
into
his
logical
machinery
and
grind
them
into
the
dust
and
powder
of
some
subtle
theory
as
the
miller
looks
out
for
grist
to
his
mill
add
to
this
physiognomical
sketch
the
minor
points
of
costume
the
open
the
coat
the
and
ribbed
stockings
and
you
will
find
in
bentham
general
appearance
a
singular
mixture
of
boyish
simplicity
and
of
the
venerableness
of
age
in
a
word
our
celebrated
jurist
presents
a
striking
illustration
of
the
difference
between
the
and
the
look
that
is
between
the
merely
abstracted
and
the
merely
personal
there
is
a
lackadaisical
about
his
whole
aspect
none
of
the
fierceness
of
pride
or
power
an
unconscious
neglect
of
his
own
person
instead
of
a
stately
assumption
of
superiority
a
placid
intelligence
instead
of
a
watchfulness
as
if
it
wished
to
make
others
its
prey
or
was
afraid
they
might
turn
and
rend
him
he
is
a
beneficent
spirit
prying
into
the
universe
not
lording
it
over
it
a
thoughtful
spectator
of
the
scenes
of
life
or
ruminator
on
the
fate
of
mankind
not
a
painted
pageant
a
stupid
idol
set
up
on
its
pedestal
of
pride
for
men
to
fall
down
and
worship
with
idiot
fear
and
wonder
at
the
thing
themselves
have
made
and
which
without
that
fear
and
wonder
would
in
itself
be
nothing
bentham
perhaps
the
importance
of
his
own
theories
he
has
been
heard
to
say
without
any
appearance
of
pride
or
affectation
that
he
should
like
to
live
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
a
year
at
a
time
at
the
end
of
the
next
six
or
eight
centuries
to
see
the
effect
which
his
writings
would
by
that
time
have
had
upon
the
world
alas
his
name
will
hardly
live
so
long
nor
do
we
think
in
point
of
fact
that
bentham
has
given
any
new
or
decided
impulse
to
the
human
mind
he
can
not
be
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
a
discoverer
in
legislation
or
morals
he
has
not
struck
out
any
great
leading
principle
or
from
which
a
number
of
others
might
be
deduced
nor
has
he
enriched
the
common
and
established
stock
of
intelligence
with
original
observations
like
pearls
thrown
into
wine
one
truth
discovered
is
immortal
and
entitles
its
author
to
be
so
for
like
a
new
substance
in
nature
it
can
not
be
destroyed
but
bentham
is
arrangement
and
the
form
of
truth
though
not
its
essence
varies
with
time
and
circumstance
he
has
methodised
collated
and
condensed
all
the
materials
prepared
to
his
hand
on
the
subjects
of
which
he
treats
in
a
masterly
and
scientific
manner
but
we
should
find
a
difficulty
in
adducing
from
his
different
works
however
elaborate
or
closely
reasoned
any
new
element
of
thought
or
even
a
new
fact
or
illustration
his
writings
are
therefore
chiefly
valuable
as
of
as
bringing
down
the
account
of
intellectual
inquiry
to
the
present
period
and
disposing
the
results
in
a
compendious
connected
and
tangible
shape
but
books
of
reference
are
chiefly
serviceable
for
facilitating
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
are
constantly
liable
to
be
superseded
and
to
grow
out
of
fashion
with
its
progress
as
the
scaffolding
is
thrown
down
as
soon
as
the
building
is
completed
bentham
is
not
the
first
writer
by
a
great
many
who
has
assumed
the
principle
of
utility
as
the
foundation
of
just
laws
and
of
all
moral
and
political
reasoning
his
merit
is
that
he
has
applied
this
principle
more
closely
and
literally
that
he
has
brought
all
the
objections
and
arguments
more
distinctly
labelled
and
ticketted
under
this
one
head
and
made
a
more
constant
and
explicit
reference
to
it
at
every
step
of
his
progress
than
any
other
writer
perhaps
the
weak
side
of
his
conclusions
also
is
that
he
has
carried
this
single
view
of
his
subject
too
far
and
not
made
sufficient
allowance
for
the
varieties
of
human
nature
and
the
caprices
and
irregularities
of
the
human
will
he
has
not
allowed
for
the
it
is
not
that
you
can
be
said
to
see
his
favourite
doctrine
of
utility
glittering
everywhere
through
his
system
like
a
vein
of
rich
shining
ore
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
material
but
it
might
be
plausibly
objected
that
he
had
struck
the
whole
mass
of
fancy
prejudice
passion
sense
whim
with
his
petrific
leaden
mace
that
he
had
bound
volatile
hermes
and
reduced
the
theory
and
practice
of
human
life
to
a
of
reason
and
dull
plodding
technical
calculation
the
gentleman
is
himself
a
capital
logician
and
he
has
been
led
by
this
circumstance
to
consider
man
as
a
logical
animal
we
fear
this
view
of
the
matter
will
hardly
hold
water
if
we
attend
to
the
man
the
constitution
of
his
mind
will
scarcely
be
found
to
be
built
up
of
pure
reason
and
a
regard
to
consequences
if
we
consider
the
man
with
whom
the
legislator
has
chiefly
to
do
it
will
be
found
to
be
still
less
so
every
pleasure
says
bentham
is
equally
a
good
and
is
to
be
taken
into
the
account
as
such
in
a
moral
estimate
whether
it
be
the
pleasure
of
sense
or
of
conscience
whether
it
arise
from
the
exercise
of
virtue
or
the
perpetration
of
crime
we
are
afraid
the
human
mind
does
not
readily
come
into
this
doctrine
this
ratio
interpreted
according
to
the
letter
our
moral
sentiments
are
made
up
of
sympathies
and
antipathies
of
sense
and
imagination
of
understanding
and
prejudice
the
soul
by
reason
of
its
weakness
is
an
aggregating
and
an
exclusive
principle
it
clings
obstinately
to
some
things
and
violently
rejects
others
and
it
must
do
so
in
a
great
measure
or
it
would
act
contrary
to
its
own
nature
it
needs
helps
and
stages
in
its
progress
and
all
appliances
and
means
to
boot
which
can
raise
it
to
a
partial
conformity
to
truth
and
good
the
utmost
it
is
capable
of
and
bring
it
into
a
tolerable
harmony
with
the
universe
by
aiming
at
too
much
by
dismissing
collateral
aids
by
extending
itself
to
the
farthest
verge
of
the
conceivable
and
possible
it
loses
its
elasticity
and
vigour
its
impulse
and
its
direction
the
moralist
can
no
more
do
without
the
intermediate
use
of
rules
and
principles
without
the
ground
of
habit
without
the
levers
of
the
understanding
than
the
mechanist
can
discard
the
use
of
wheels
and
pulleys
and
perform
every
thing
by
simple
motion
if
the
mind
of
man
were
competent
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
truth
and
good
and
act
upon
it
at
once
and
independently
of
all
other
considerations
bentham
plan
would
be
a
feasible
one
and
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
would
be
the
best
possible
ground
to
place
morality
upon
but
it
is
not
so
in
ascertaining
the
rules
of
moral
conduct
we
must
have
regard
not
merely
to
the
nature
of
the
object
but
to
the
capacity
of
the
agent
and
to
his
fitness
for
apprehending
or
attaining
it
pleasure
is
that
which
is
so
in
itself
good
is
that
which
approves
itself
as
such
on
reflection
or
the
idea
of
which
is
a
source
of
satisfaction
all
pleasure
is
not
therefore
morally
speaking
equally
a
good
for
all
pleasure
does
not
equally
bear
reflecting
on
there
are
some
tastes
that
are
sweet
in
the
mouth
and
bitter
in
the
belly
and
there
is
a
similar
contradiction
and
anomaly
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
man
again
what
would
become
of
the
meminisse
of
the
poet
if
a
principle
of
fluctuation
and
reaction
is
not
inherent
in
the
very
constitution
of
our
nature
or
if
all
moral
truth
is
a
mere
literal
truism
we
are
not
then
so
much
to
inquire
what
certain
things
are
abstractedly
or
in
themselves
as
how
they
affect
the
mind
and
to
approve
or
condemn
them
accordingly
the
same
object
seen
near
strikes
us
more
powerfully
than
at
a
distance
things
thrown
into
masses
give
a
greater
blow
to
the
imagination
than
when
scattered
and
divided
into
their
component
parts
a
number
of
do
not
make
a
mountain
though
a
mountain
is
actually
made
up
of
atoms
so
moral
truth
must
present
itself
under
a
certain
aspect
and
from
a
certain
point
of
view
in
order
to
produce
its
full
and
proper
effect
upon
the
mind
the
laws
of
the
affections
are
as
necessary
as
those
of
optics
a
calculation
of
consequences
is
no
more
equivalent
to
a
sentiment
than
a
enumeration
of
square
yards
or
feet
touches
the
fancy
like
the
sight
of
the
alps
or
andes
to
give
an
instance
or
two
of
what
we
mean
those
who
on
pure
cosmopolite
principles
or
on
the
ground
of
abstract
humanity
affect
an
extraordinary
regard
for
the
turks
and
tartars
have
been
accused
of
neglecting
their
duties
to
their
friends
and
neighbours
well
then
what
is
the
state
of
the
question
here
one
human
being
is
no
doubt
as
much
worth
in
himself
independently
of
the
circumstances
of
time
or
place
as
another
but
he
is
not
of
so
much
value
to
us
and
our
affections
could
our
imagination
take
wing
with
our
speculative
faculties
to
the
other
side
of
the
globe
or
to
the
ends
of
the
universe
could
our
eyes
behold
whatever
our
reason
teaches
us
to
be
possible
could
our
hands
reach
as
far
as
our
thoughts
or
wishes
we
might
then
busy
ourselves
to
advantage
with
the
hottentots
or
hold
intimate
converse
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
but
being
as
we
are
our
feelings
evaporate
in
so
large
a
space
we
must
draw
the
circle
of
our
affections
and
duties
somewhat
closer
the
heart
hovers
and
fixes
nearer
home
it
is
true
the
bands
of
private
or
of
local
and
natural
affection
are
often
nay
in
general
too
tightly
strained
so
as
frequently
to
do
harm
instead
of
good
but
the
present
question
is
whether
we
can
with
safety
and
effect
be
wholly
emancipated
from
them
whether
we
should
shake
them
off
at
pleasure
and
without
mercy
as
the
only
bar
to
the
triumph
of
truth
and
justice
or
whether
benevolence
constructed
upon
a
logical
scale
would
not
be
merely
whether
duty
raised
to
too
lofty
a
pitch
of
refinement
might
not
sink
into
callous
indifference
or
hollow
selfishness
again
is
it
not
to
exact
too
high
a
strain
from
humanity
to
ask
us
to
qualify
the
degree
of
abhorrence
we
feel
against
a
murderer
by
taking
into

practised

they

for

of
this
is
a
sort
of
sophistry
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
disprove
on
the
bare
scheme
of
contingent
utility
but
on
the
ground
that
we
have
stated
it
must
pass
for
a
mere
irony
what
the
proportion
between
the
good
and
the
evil
will
really
be
found
in
any
of
the
supposed

may
be
a

to

imagination

the

it

bentham
in
adjusting
the
provisions
of
a
penal
code
lays
too
little
stress
on
the
cooperation
of
the
natural
prejudices
of
mankind
and
the
habitual
feelings
of
that
class
of
persons
for

they

for

controul

a
set
of
desperadoes

only
by
their

what
wonder
that
so
little
progress
has
been
made
towards
a
mutual
understanding
between
the
two
parties
they
are
quite
a

a

are
sadly
at

loss
for

as
fair
for
this
office
as

of

of

who

with

the
thing
is
impossible
the

of
the
country
are
therefore
ineffectual
and
abortive
because
they
are
made
by
the

by

as
it

the
of

is
a
book
sealed
no
one
has
been
able
to
penetrate
to
the
inside
bentham
in
his
attempts
to
revise
and
amend
our
criminal
jurisprudence
proceeds
entirely
on
his
favourite
principle
of
utility
convince
highwaymen
and
that
it
will
be
for
their
interest
to
reform
and
they
will
reform
and
lead
honest
lives

to

he
says
all
men
act
from
calculation
even
madmen
reason
and
in
our
opinion
he
might
as
well
carry
this
maxim
to
bedlam
or
luke
and
apply
it
to
the
inhabitants
as
think
to
coerce
or
overawe
the
inmates
of
a
gaol
or
those
whose
practices
make
them
candidates
for
that
distinction
by
the
mere
dry
detailed
convictions
of
the
understanding
criminals
are
not
to
be
influenced
by
reason
for
it
is
of
the
very
essence
of
crime
to
disregard
consequences
both
to
ourselves
and
others
you
may
as
well
preach
philosophy
to
a
drunken
man
or
to
the
dead
as
to
those
who
are
under
the
instigation
of
any
mischievous
passion
a
man
is
a
drunkard
and
you
tell
him
he
ought
to
be
sober
he
is
debauched
and
you
ask
him
to
reform
he
is
idle
and
you
recommend
industry
to
him
as
his
wisest
course
he
gambles
and
you
remind
him
that
he
may
be
ruined
by
this
foible
he
has
lost
his
character
and
you
advise
him
to
get
into
some
reputable
service
or
lucrative
situation
vice
becomes
a
habit
with
him
and
you
request
him
to
rouse
himself
and
shake
it
off
he
is
starving
and
you
warn
him
that
if
he
breaks
the
law
he
will
be
hanged
none
of
this
reasoning
reaches
the
mark
it
aims
at
the
culprit
who
violates
and
suffers
the
vengeance
of
the
laws
is
not
the
dupe
of
ignorance
but
the
slave
of
passion
the
victim
of
habit
or
necessity
to
argue
with
strong
passion
with
inveterate
habit
with
desperate
circumstances
is
to
talk
to
the
winds
clownish
ignorance
may
indeed
be
dispelled
and
taught
better
but
it
is
seldom
that
a
criminal
is
not
aware
of
the
consequences
of
his
act
or
has
not
made
up
his
mind
to
the
alternative
they
are
in
general
knowing
by
you
tell
a
person
of
this
stamp
what
is
his
interest
he
says
he
does
not
care
about
his
interest
or
the
world
and
he
differ
on
that
particular
but
there
is
one
point
on
which
he
must
agree
with
them
namely
what
think
of
his
conduct
and
that
is
the
only
hold
you
have
of
him
a
man
may
be
callous
and
indifferent
to
what
happens
to
himself
but
he
is
never
indifferent
to
public
opinion
or
proof
against
open
scorn
and
infamy
shame
then
not
fear
is
the
of
the
law
he
who
is
not
afraid
of
being
pointed
at
as
a
will
not
mind
a
month
hard
labour
he
who
is
prepared
to
take
the
life
of
another
is
already
reckless
of
his
own
but
every
one
makes
a
sorry
figure
in
the
pillory
and
the
being
launched
from
the
new
drop
lowers
a
man
in
his
own
opinion
the
lawless
and
violent
spirit
who
is
hurried
by
headstrong
to
break
the
laws
does
not
like
to
have
the
ground
of
pride
and
obstinacy
struck
from
under
his
feet
this
is
what
gives
the
of
the
metropolis
such
a
dread
of
the
it
makes
them
ridiculous
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
very
circumstance
renders
the
reform
of
criminals
nearly
hopeless
it
is
the
apprehension
of
being
stigmatized
by
public
opinion
the
fear
of
what
will
be
thought
and
said
of
them
that
deters
men
from
the
violation
of
the
laws
while
their
character
remains
unimpeached
but
honour
once
lost
all
is
lost
the
man
can
never
be
himself
again
a
citizen
is
like
a
soldier
a
part
of
a
machine
who
submits
to
certain
hardships
privations
and
dangers
not
for
his
own
ease
pleasure
profit
or
even
conscience
but
what
is
it
that
keeps
the
machine
together
in
either
case
not
punishment
or
discipline
but
sympathy
the
soldier
mounts
the
breach
or
stands
in
the
trenches
the
peasant
hedges
and
ditches
or
the
mechanic
plies
his
ceaseless
task
because
the
one
will
not
be
called
a
the
other
a
but
let
the
one
turn
deserter
and
the
other
vagabond
and
there
is
an
end
of
him
the
grinding
law
of
necessity
which
is
no
other
than
a
name
a
breath
loses
its
force
he
is
no
longer
sustained
by
the
good
opinion
of
others
and
he
drops
out
of
his
place
in
society
a
useless
clog
bentham
takes
a
culprit
and
puts
him
into
what
he
calls
a
that
is
a
sort
of
circular
prison
with
open
cells
like
a
glass
he
sits
in
the
middle
and
sees
all
the
other
does
he
gives
him
work
to
do
and
lectures
him
if
he
does
not
do
it
he
takes
liquor
from
him
and
society
and
liberty
but
he
feeds
and
clothes
him
and
keeps
him
out
of
mischief
and
when
he
has
convinced
him
by
force
and
reason
together
that
this
life
is
for
his
good
he
turns
him
out
upon
the
world
a
reformed
man
and
as
confident
of
the
success
of
his
as
the
shoemaker
of
that
which
he
has
just
taken
off
the
last
or
the
parisian
barber
in
sterne
of
the
buckle
of
his
wig
dip
it
in
the
ocean
said
the
perruquier
and
it
will
stand
but
we
doubt
the
durability
of
our
projector
patchwork
will
our
convert
to
the
great
principle
of
utility
work
when
he
is
from
under
bentham
eye
because
he
was
forced
to
work
when
under
it
will
he
keep
sober
because
he
has
been
kept
from
liquor
so
long
will
he
not
return
to
loose
company
because
he
has
had
the
pleasure
of
sitting
with
a
philosopher
of
late
will
he
not
steal
now
that
his
hands
are
untied
will
he
not
take
the
road
now
that
it
is
free
to
him
will
he
not
call
his
benefactor
all
the
names
he
can
set
his
tongue
to
the
moment
his
back
is
turned
all
this
is
more
than
to
be
feared
the
charm
of
criminal
life
like
that
of
savage
life
consists
in
liberty
in
hardship
in
danger
and
in
the
contempt
of
death
in
one
word
in
extraordinary
excitement
and
he
who
has
tasted
of
it
will
no
more
return
to
regular
habits
of
life
than
a
man
will
take
to
water
after
drinking
brandy
or
than
a
wild
beast
will
give
over
hunting

prey

bury

it

it

but
it
includes
every

it

very
nicely
mosaic

slide

even
surface
without

arrested
any
where

his
view

human
mind
resembles
a
map
rather
than
a

the
outline
the
disposition
is
correct
but
it
wants
colouring
and
relief
there
is
a
technicality
of
manner
which
renders
his
writings
of
more
value
to
the
professional
inquirer
than
to
the
general
reader
again
his
style
is
unpopular
not
to
say
unintelligible
he
writes
a
language
of
his
own
that
his

have
been
translated

they
ought
to
be

into

people
wonder
that
bentham
has
not
been
prosecuted
for
the
boldness
and
severity
of
some
of
his
invectives
he
might
wrap
up
high
treason
in
one
of
his
inextricable
periods
and
it
would
never
find
its
way
into

a
kind
of
manuscript
author
he
writes
a
which
the
vulgar
have
no
key
to
the
construction
of
his
sentences
is
a
curious
framework
with
pegs
and

to
hang
his
thoughts
upon
for
his
own
use
and
guidance
but
almost
out
of
the
reach

else
it

barbarous
philosophical
jargon
with

the
repetitions

uncouth
nomenclature
and
verbiage
of

what
makes
it
worse
it
is
not
mere
verbiage
but
has
a
great
deal
of
acuteness
and
meaning
in
it
which
you
would
be
glad
to
pick
out
if
you
could
in

bentham
writes
as
if
he
was
allowed
but
a
single
sentence
to
express
his
whole
view
of
a
subject
in
and
as
if
should
he
omit
a
single
circumstance
or
step
of
the
argument
it
would
be
lost
to
the
world
for
ever
like
an

flaw
in
the
this
is
the
importance
of
our
own
discoveries
and
mistaking

nature
and

altogether
bentham
has
this
disability
it
is
not
natural
to
him
his
admirable
little
work
published
forty
years
ago
is
clear
easy
and
vigorous
but
bentham
has
shut
himself
up
since
then
in
nook
monastic
conversing
only
with
followers
of
his
own
or
with
men
of
ind
and
has
endeavoured
to
overlay
his
natural
humour
sense
spirit
and
style
with
the
dust
and
cobwebs
of
an
obscure
solitude
the
best
of
it
is
he
thinks
his
present
mode
of
expressing
himself
perfect
and
that
whatever
may
be
objected
to
his
law
or
logic
no
one
can
find
the
least
fault
with
the
purity
simplicity
and
perspicuity
of
his
style
bentham
in
private
life
is
an
amiable
and
exemplary
character
he
is
a
little
romantic
or
so
and
has
dissipated
part
of
a
handsome
fortune
in
practical
speculations
he
lends
an
ear
to
plausible
projectors
and
if
he
can
not
prove
them
to
be
wrong
in
their
premises
or
their
conclusions
thinks
himself

stake
his

scruples
of
an

about

smacks
of

good
to
read
it

to

who

he
has
a
great
contempt

if

itself
it
is
indeed
the
great

of

that

concentrated
his

altogether

all

and

anathema
could
so
many

of

hurried
away
by
what

neither

particle

nor

of

in
it
is
the
as
it

been
called
at

and
the
next
a
withered
beldame
like

or

was
it
for

that
our

steeped

the

spirit
and
the
cobwebs
of
to
throw
themselves
at
the
feet
of
the
new
gamaliel
and
learn
wisdom
from
him
was
it
for
this
that
students
at
the
bar
acute
inquisitive
sceptical
here
only
wild
enthusiasts
neglected
for
a
while
the
paths
of
preferment
and
the
law
as
too
narrow
tortuous
and
unseemly
to
bear
the
pure
and
broad
light
of
reason
was
it
for
this
that
students
in
medicine
missed
their
way
to
lecturerships
and
the
top
of
their
profession
deeming
lightly
of
the
health
of

and
dreaming
only
of
the
renovation
of
society
and
the
march
of
mind
was
it
to
this
that
southey
pointed
to
this
that
coleridge
tended
was
it
for
this
that
godwin
himself
sat
with
arms
folded
and
like
cato
gave
his
little
senate
laws
or
rather
like
another
prospero
uttered
syllables
that
with
their
enchanted
breath
were
to
change
the
world
and
might
almost
stop
the
stars
in
their
courses
oh
and
is
all
forgot
is
this
sun
of
intellect
blotted
from
the
sky
or
has
it
suffered
total
eclipse
or
is
it
we
who
make
the
fancied
gloom
by
looking
at
it
through
the
paltry
broken
stained
fragments
of
our
own
interests
and
prejudices
were
we
fools
then
or
are
we
dishonest
now
or
was
the
impulse
of
the
mind
less
likely
to
be
true
and
sound
when
it
arose
from
high
thought
and
warm
feeling
than
afterwards
when
it
was
warped
and
debased
by
the
example
the
vices
and
follies
of
the
world
the
fault
then
of
godwin
philosophy
in
one
word
was
too
much
ambition
by
that
sin
fell
the
angels
he
conceived
too
nobly
of
his
fellows
the
most
unpardonable
crime
against
them
for
there
is
nothing
that
annoys
our
so
much
as
being
complimented
on
imaginary
achievements
to
which
we
are
wholly
unequal
he
raised
the
standard
of
morality
above
the
reach
of
humanity
and
by
directing
virtue
to
the
most
airy
and
romantic
heights
made
her
path
dangerous
solitary
and
impracticable
the
author
of
the
took
abstract
reason
for
the
rule
of
conduct
and
abstract
good
for
its
end
he
places
the
human
mind
on
an
elevation
from
which
it
commands
a
view
of
the
whole
line
of
moral
consequences
and
requires
it
to
conform
its
acts
to
the
larger
and
more
enlightened
conscience
which
it
has
thus
acquired
he
absolves
man
from
the
gross
and
narrow
ties
of
sense
custom
authority
private
and
local
attachment
in
order
that
he
may
devote
himself
to
the
boundless
pursuit
of
universal
benevolence
godwin
gives
no
quarter
to
the
amiable
weaknesses
of
our
nature
nor
does
he
stoop
to
avail
himself
of
the
supplementary
aids
of
an
imperfect
virtue
gratitude
promises
friendship
family
affection
give
way
not
that
they
may
be
merged
in
the
opposite
vices
or
in
want
of
principle
but
that
the
void
may
be
filled
up
by
the
disinterested
love
of
good
and
the
dictates
of
inflexible
justice
which
is
the
law
of
laws
and
sovereign
of
sovereigns
all
minor
considerations
yield
in
his
system
to
the
stern
sense
of
duty
as
they
do
in
the
ordinary
and
established
ones
to
the
voice
of
necessity
godwin
theory
and
that
of
more
approved
reasoners
differ
only
in
this
that
what
are
with
them
the
exceptions
the
extreme
cases
he
makes
the
rule
no
one
denies
that
on
great
occasions
in
moments
of
fearful
excitement
or
when
a
mighty
object
is
at
stake
the
lesser
and
merely
instrumental
points
of
duty
are
to
be
sacrificed
without
remorse
at
the
shrine
of
patriotism
of
honour
and
of
conscience
but
the
disciple
of
the
no
wonder
it
found
so
many
impugners
even
in
its
own
bosom
is
to
be
always
the
hero
of
duty
the
law
to
which
he
has
bound
himself
never
swerves
nor
relaxes
his
feeling
of
what
is
right
is
to
be
at
all
times
wrought
up
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiastic
he
must
become
the
unshrinking
martyr
and
confessor
of
the
public
good
if
it
be
said
that
this
scheme
is
chimerical
and
impracticable
on
ordinary
occasions
and
to
the
generality
of
mankind
well
and
good
but
those
who
accuse
the
author
of
having
trampled
on
the
common
feelings
and
prejudices
of
mankind
in
wantonness
or
insult
or
without
wishing
to
substitute
something
better
and
only
unattainable
because
it
is
better
in
their
stead
accuse
him
wrongfully
we
may
not
be
able
to
launch
the
bark
of
our
affections
on
the
of
humanity
we
may
be
forced
to
paddle
along
its
shores
or
shelter
in
its
creeks
and
rivulets
but
we
have
no
right
to
reproach
the
bold
and
adventurous
pilot
who
dared
us
to
tempt
the
uncertain
abyss
with
our
own
want
of
courage
or
of
skill
or
with
the
jealousies
and
impatience
which
deter
us
from
undertaking
or
might
prevent
us
from
accomplishing
the
voyage
the
concerning
political
it
was
urged
by
its
favourers
and
defenders
at
the
time
and
may
still
be
so
without
either
profaneness
or
levity
is
a
metaphysical
and
logical
commentary
on
some
of
the
most
beautiful
and
striking
texts
of
scripture
godwin
is
a
mixture
of
the
stoic
and
of
the
christian
philosopher
to
break
the
force
of
the
vulgar
objections
and
outcry
that
have
been
raised
against
the
modern
philosophy
as
if
it
were
a
new
and
monstrous
birth
in
morals
it
may
be
worth
noticing
that
volumes
of
sermons
have
been
written
to
excuse
the
founder
of
christianity
for
not
including
friendship
and
private
affection
among
its
golden
rules
but
rather
excluding
them
a
moreover
the
answer
to
the
question
who
is
thy
neighbour
added
to
the
divine
precept
thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
is
the
same
as
in
the
exploded
pages
of
our
author
he
to
whom
we
can
do
most
good
in
determining
this
point
we
were
not
to
be
influenced
by
any
extrinsic
or
collateral
considerations
by
our
own
predilections
or
the
expectations
of
others
by
our
obligations
to
them
or
any
services
they
might
be
able
to
render
us
by
the
climate
they
were
born
in
by
the
house
they
lived
in
by
rank
or
religion
or
party
or
personal
ties
but
by
the
abstract
merits
the
pure
and
unbiassed
justice
of
the
case
the
artificial
helps
and
checks
to
moral
conduct
were
set
aside
as
spurious
and
unnecessary
and
we
came
at
once
to
the
grand
and
simple
question
in
what
manner
we
could
best
contribute
to
the
greatest
possible
good
this
was
the
paramount
obligation
in
all
cases
whatever
from
which
we
had
no
right
to
free
ourselves
upon
any
idle
or
formal
pretext
and
of
which
each
person
was
to
judge
for
himself
under
the
infallible
authority
of
his
own
opinion
and
the
inviolable
sanction
of
his
there
was
the
rub
that
made
of
so
short
life
godwin
definition
of
morals
was
the
same
as
the
admired
one
of
law
without
but
with
the
unlimited
scope
of
private
opinion
and
in
a
boundless
field
of
speculation
for
nothing
less
would
satisfy
the
pretensions
of
the
new
school
there
was
danger
that
the
unseasoned
novice
might
substitute
some
pragmatical
conceit
of
his
own
for
the
rule
of
right
reason
and
mistake
a
heartless
indifference
for
a
superiority
to
more
natural
and
generous
feelings
our
ardent
and
dauntless
reformer
followed
out
the
moral
of
the
parable
of
the
good
samaritan
into
its
most
rigid
and
repulsive
consequences
with
a
pen
of
steel
and
let
fall
his
trenchant
blade
on
every
vulnerable
point
of
human
infirmity
but
there
is
a
want
in
his
system
of
the
mild
and
persuasive
tone
of
the
gospel
where
all
is
conscience
and
tender
heart
man
was
indeed
screwed
up
by
mood
and
figure
into
a
logical
machine
that
was
to
forward
the
public
good
with
the
utmost
punctuality
and
effect
and
it
might
go
very
well
on
smooth
ground
and
under
favourable
circumstances
but
would
it
work
or
the
it
was
to
be
feared
that
the
proud
temple
of
reason
which
at
a
distance
and
in
stately
supposition
shone
like
the
palaces
of
the
new
jerusalem
might
when
placed
on
actual
ground
be
broken
up
into
the
sordid
styes
of
sensuality
and
the
petty
shops
of
every
man
it
was
proposed
so
ran
the
tenour
of
the
bond
was
to
be
a
regulus
a
codrus
a
cato
or
a
brutus
every
woman
a
mother
of
the
it
was
well
said
and
is
a
kind
of
good
deed
to
say
well
but
heroes
on
paper
might
degenerate
into
vagabonds
in
practice
corinnas
into
courtezans
thus
a
refined
and
permanent
individual
attachment
is
intended
to
supply
the
place
and
avoid
the
inconveniences
of
marriage
but
vows
of
eternal
constancy
without
church
security
are
found
to
be
fragile
a
member
of
the
and
perfect
commonwealth
of
letters
lends
another
a
hundred
pounds
for
immediate
and
pressing
use
and
when
he
applies
for
it
again
the
borrower
has
still
more
need
of
it
than
he
and
retains
it
for
his
own
especial
which
is
tantamount
to
the
public
good
the
exchequer
of
pure
reason
like
that
of
the
state
never
refunds
the
political
as
well
as
the
religious
fanatic
appeals
from
the
opinion
and
claims
of
others
to
the
highest
and
most
impartial
tribunal
namely
his
own
breast
two
persons
agree
to
live
together
in
chambers
on
principles
of
pure
equality
and
mutual
assistance
but
when
it
comes
to
the
push
one
of
them
finds
that
the
other
always
insists
on
his
fetching
water
from
the
pump
in
and
cleaning
his
shoes
for
him
a
modest
assurance
was
not
the
least
indispensable
virtue
in
the
new
perfectibility
code
and
it
was
hence
discovered
to
be
a
scheme
like
other
schemes
where
there
are
all
prizes
and
no
blanks
for
the
accommodation
of
the
enterprizing
and
cunning
at
the
expence
of
the
credulous
and
honest
this
broke
up
the
system
and
left
no
good
odour
behind
it
reason
has
become
a
sort
of
and
philosophy
has
fallen
first
into
a
fasting
then
into
a
sadness
then
into
a
decline
and
last
into
the
dissolution
of
which
we
all
complain
this
is
a
worse
error
than
the
former
we
may
be
said
to
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
ourselves
and
what
remains
is
beastly
the
point
of
view
from
which
this
matter
may
be
fairly
considered
is
and
may
be
stated
thus
in
the
first
place
it
by
no
means
follows
because
reason
is
found
not
to
be
the
only
infallible
or
safe
rule
of
conduct
that
it
is
no
rule
at
all
or
that
we
are
to
discard
it
altogether
with
derision
and
ignominy
on
the
contrary
if
not
the
sole
it
is
the
principal
ground
of
action
it
is
the
guide
the
stay
and
anchor
of
our
purest
thoughts
and
soul
of
all
our
moral
being
in
proportion
as
we
strengthen
and
expand
this
principle
and
bring
our
affections
and
subordinate
but
perhaps
more
powerful
motives
of
action
into
harmony
with
it
it
will
not
admit
of
a
doubt
that
we
advance
to
the
goal
of
perfection
and
answer
the
ends
of
our
creation
those
ends
which
not
only
morality
enjoins
but
which
religion
sanctions
if
with
the
utmost
stretch
of
reason
man
can
not
as
some
seemed
inclined
to
suppose
soar
up
to
the
god
and
quit
the
ground
of
human
frailty
yet
stripped
wholly
of
it
he
sinks
at
once
into
the
brute
if
it
can
not
stand
alone
in
its
naked
simplicity
but
requires
other
props
to
buttress
it
up
or
ornaments
to
set
it
off
yet
without
it
the
moral
structure
would
fall
flat
and
dishonoured
to
the
ground
private
reason
is
that
which
raises
the
individual
above
his
mere
animal
instincts
appetites
and
passions
public
reason
in
its
gradual
progress
separates
the
savage
from
the
civilized
state
without
the
one
men
would
resemble
wild
beasts
in
their
dens
without
the
other
they
would
be
speedily
converted
into
hordes
of
barbarians
or
banditti
sir
walter
scott
in
his
zeal
to
restore
the
spirit
of
loyalty
of
passive
obedience
and
as
an
acknowledgment
for
his
having
been
created
a
baronet
by
a
prince
of
the
house
of
brunswick
may
think
it
a
fine
thing
to
return
in
imagination
to
the
good
old
times
when
in
auvergne
alone
there
were
three
hundred
nobles
whose
most
ordinary
actions
were
robbery
rape
and
murder
when
the
castle
of
each
norman
baron
was
a
strong
hold
from
which
the
lordly
proprietor
issued
to
oppress
and
plunder
the
neighbouring
districts
and
when
the
saxon
peasantry
were
treated
by
their
gay
and
gallant
tyrants
as
a
herd
of
loathsome
swine
but
for
our
own
parts
we
beg
to
be
excused
we
had
rather
live
in
the
same
age
with
the
author
of
waverley
and
blackwood
magazine
reason
is
the
meter
and
alnager
in
civil
intercourse
by
which
each
person
upstart
and
contradictory
pretensions
are
weighed
and
approved
or
found
wanting
and
without
which
it
could
not
subsist
any
more
than
traffic
or
the
exchange
of
commodities
could
be
carried
on
without
weights
and
measures
it
is
the
medium
of
knowledge
and
the
polisher
of
manners
by
creating
common
interests
and
ideas
or
in
the
words
of
a
contemporary
writer
reason
is
the
queen
of
the
moral
world
the
soul
of
the
universe
the
lamp
of
human
life
the
pillar
of
society
the
foundation
of
law
the
beacon
of
nations
the
golden
chain
let
down
from
heaven
which
links
all
accountable
and
all
intelligent
natures
in
one
common
system
and
in
the
vain
strife
between
fanatic
innovation
and
fanatic
prejudice
we
are
exhorted
to
dethrone
this
queen
of
the
world
to
blot
out
this
light
of
the
mind
to
deface
this
fair
column
to
break
in
pieces
this
golden
chain
we
are
to
discard
and
throw
from
us
with
loud
taunts
and
bitter
execrations
that
reason
which
has
been
the
lofty
theme
of
the
philosopher
the
poet
the
moralist
and
the
divine
whose
name
was
not
first
named
to
be
abused
by
the
enthusiasts
of
the
french
revolution
or
to
be
blasphemed
by
the
madder
enthusiasts
the
advocates
of
divine
right
but
which
is
coeval
with
and
inseparable
from
the
nature
and
faculties
of
man
is
the
image
of
his
maker
stamped
upon
him
at
his
birth
the
understanding
breathed
into
him
with
the
breath
of
life
and
in
the
participation
and
improvement
of
which
alone
he
is
raised
above
the
brute
creation
and
his
own
physical
nature
the
overstrained
and
ridiculous
pretensions
of
monks
and
ascetics
were
never
thought
to
justify
a
return
to
unbridled
licence
of
manners
or
the
throwing
aside
of
all
decency
the
hypocrisy
cruelty
and
fanaticism
often
attendant
on
peculiar
professions
of
sanctity
have
not
banished
the
name
of
religion
from
the
world
neither
can
the
unreasonableness
of
the
reason
of
some
modern
sciolists
so
unreason
our
reason
as
to
debar
us
of
the
benefit
of
this
principle
in
future
or
to
disfranchise
us
of
the
highest
privilege
of
our
nature
in
the
second
place
if
it
is
admitted
that
reason
alone
is
not
the
sole
and
ground
of
morals
it
is
to
godwin
that
we
are
indebted
for
having
settled
the
point
no
one
denied
or
distrusted
this
principle
before
his
time
as
the
absolute
judge
and
interpreter
in
all
questions
of
difficulty
and
if
this
is
no
longer
the
case
it
is
because
he
has
taken
this
principle
and
followed
it
into
its
remotest
consequences
with
more
keenness
of
eye
and
steadiness
of
hand
than
any
other
expounder
of
ethics
his
grand
work
is
at
least
an
to
shew
the
weak
sides
and
imperfections
of
human
reason
as
the
sole
law
of
human
action
by
overshooting
the
mark
or
by
flying
an
eagle
flight
forth
and
right
on
he
has
pointed
out
the
limit
or
line
of
separation
between
what
is
practicable
and
what
is
barely
conceivable
by
imposing
impossible
tasks
on
the
naked
strength
of
the
will
he
has
discovered
how
far
it
is
or
is
not
in
our
power
to
dispense
with
the
illusions
of
sense
to
resist
the
calls
of
affection
to
emancipate
ourselves
from
the
force
of
habit
and
thus
though
he
has
not
said
it
himself
has
enabled
others
to
say
to
the
towering
aspirations
after
good
and
to
the
pride
of
human
intellect
thus
far
shalt
thou
come
and
no
farther
captain
parry
would
be
thought
to
have
rendered
a
service
to
navigation
and
his
country
no
less
by
proving
that
there
is
no
passage
than
if
he
had
ascertained
that
there
is
one
so
godwin
has
rendered
an
essential
service
to
moral
science
by
attempting
in
vain
to
pass
the
arctic
circle
and
frozen
regions
where
the
understanding
is
no
longer
warmed
by
the
affections
nor
fanned
by
the
breeze
of
fancy
this
is
the
effect
of
all
bold
original
and
powerful
thinking
that
it
either
discovers
the
truth
or
detects
where
error
lies
and
the
only
crime
with
which
godwin
can
be
charged
as
a
political
and
moral
reasoner
is
that
he
has
displayed
a
more
ardent
spirit
and
a
more
independent
activity
of
thought
than
others
in
establishing
the
fallacy
if
fallacy
it
be
of
an
old
popular
prejudice
that
just
and
true
were
by
championing
it
to
the
outrance
and
in
the
final
result
placing
the
gothic
structure
of
human
virtue
on
an
humbler
but
a
wider
and
safer
foundation
than
it
had
hitherto
occupied
in
the
volumes
and
systems
of
the
learned
godwin
is
an
inventor
in
the
regions
of
romance
as
well
as
a
skilful
and
hardy
explorer
of
those
of
moral
truth
and
are
two
of
the
most
splendid
and
impressive
works
of
the
imagination
that
have
appeared
in
our
times
it
is
not
merely
that
these
novels
are
very
well
for
a
philosopher
to
have
produced
they
are
admirable
and
complete
in
themselves
and
would
not
lead
you
to
suppose
that
the
author
who
is
so
entirely
at
home
in
human
character
and
dramatic
situation
had
ever
dabbled
in
logic
or
metaphysics
the
first
of
these
particularly
is
a
both
as
to
invention
and
execution
the
romantic
and
chivalrous
principle
of
the
love
of
personal
fame
is
embodied
in
the
finest
possible
manner
in
the
character
of
falkland
b
as
in
caleb
williams
who
is
not
the
first
but
the
second
character
in
the
piece
we
see
the
very
demon
of
curiosity
personified
perhaps
the
art
with
which
these
two
characters
are
contrived
to
relieve
and
set
off
each
other
has
never
been
surpassed
in
any
work
of
fiction
with
the
exception
of
the
immortal
satire
of
cervantes
the
restless
and
inquisitive
spirit
of
caleb
williams
in
search
and
in
possession
of
his
patron
fatal
secret
haunts
the
latter
like
a
second
conscience
plants
stings
in
his
tortured
mind
fans
the
flame
of
his
jealous
ambition
struggling
with
agonized
remorse
and
the
hapless
but
falkland
at
length
falls
a
martyr
to
the
persecution
of
that
morbid
and
overpowering
interest
of
which
his
mingled
virtues
and
vices
have
rendered
him
the
object
we
conceive
no
one
ever
began
caleb
williams
that
did
not
read
it
through
no
one
that
ever
read
it
could
possibly
forget
it
or
speak
of
it
after
any
length
of
time
but
with
an
impression
as
if
the
events
and
feelings
had
been
personal
to
himself
this
is
the
case
also
with
the
story
of
leon
which
with
less
dramatic
interest
and
intensity
of
purpose
is
set
off
by
a
more
gorgeous
and
flowing
eloquence
and
by
a
crown
of
preternatural
imagery
that
waves
over
it
like
a
it
is
the
beauty
and
the
charm
of
godwin
descriptions
that
the
reader
identifies
himself
with
the
author
and
the
secret
of
this
is
that
the
author
has
identified
himself
with
his
personages
indeed
he
has
created
them
they
are
the
proper
issue
of
his
brain
lawfully
begot
not
foundlings
nor
the
bastards
of
his
art
he
is
not
an
indifferent
callous
spectator
of
the
scenes
which
he
himself
pourtrays
but
without
seeming
to
feel
them
there
is
no
look
of
and
plagiarism
the
beggarly
copiousness
of
borrowed
wealth
no
from
manuscripts
from
forgotten
chronicles
nor
piecing
out
of
vague
traditions
with
fragments
and
snatches
of
old
ballads
so
that
the
result
resembles
a
gaudy
staring
transparency
in
which
you
can
not
distinguish
the
daubing
of
the
painter
from
the
light
that
shines
through
the
flimsy
colours
and
gives
them
brilliancy
here
all
is
clearly
made
out
with
strokes
of
the
pencil
by
fair
not
by
factitious
means
our
author
takes
a
given
subject
from
nature
or
from
books
and
then
fills
it
up
with
the
ardent
workings
of
his
own
mind
with
the
teeming
and
audible
pulses
of
his
own
heart
the
effect
is
entire
and
satisfactory
in
proportion
the
work
so
to
speak
and
the
author
are
one
we
are
not
puzzled
to
decide
upon
their
respective
pretensions
in
reading
godwin
novels
we
know
what
share
of
merit
the
author
has
in
them
in
reading
the
we
are
perpetually
embarrassed
in
asking
ourselves
this
question
and
perhaps
it
is
not
altogether
a
false
modesty
that
prevents
the
editor
from
putting
his
name
in
the
he
is
for
any
thing
we
know
to
the
contrary
only
a
more
voluminous
sort
of
at
least
we
may
claim
this
advantage
for
the
english
author
that
the
chains
with
which
he
rivets
our
attention
are
forged
out
of
his
own
thoughts
link
by
link
blow
for
blow
with
glowing
enthusiasm
we
see
the
genuine
ore
melted
in
the
furnace
of
fervid
feeling
and
moulded
into
stately
and
forms
and
this
is
so
far
better
than
peeping
into
an
old
iron
shop
or
pilfering
from
a
dealer
in
marine
stores
there
is
one
drawback
however
attending
this
mode
of
proceeding
which
attaches
generally
indeed
to
all
originality
of
composition
namely
that
it
has
a
tendency
to
a
certain
degree
of
monotony
he
who
draws
upon
his
own
resources
easily
comes
to
an
end
of
his
wealth
godwin
in
all
his
writings
dwells
upon
one
idea
or
exclusive
view
of
a
subject
aggrandises
a
sentiment
exaggerates
a
character
or
pushes
an
argument
to
extremes
and
makes
up
by
the
force
of
style
and
continuity
of
feeling
for
what
he
wants
in
variety
of
incident
or
ease
of
manner
this
necessary
defect
is
observable
in
his
best
works
and
is
still
more
so
in
fleetwood
and
mandeville
the
one
of
which
compared
with
his
more
admired
performances
is
mawkish
and
the
other
morbid
godwin
is
also
an
essayist
an
historian
in
short
what
is
he
not
that
belongs
to
the
character
of
an
indefatigable
and
accomplished
author
his
of
would
have
given
celebrity
to
any
man
of
letters
possessed
of
three
thousand
a
year
with
leisure
to
write
quartos
as
the
legal
acuteness
displayed
in
his
on
judge
eyre
charge
to
the
would
have
raised
any
briefless
barrister
to
the
height
of
his
profession
this
temporary
effusion
did
more
it
gave
a
turn
to
the
trials
for
high
treason
in
the
year
and
possibly
saved
the
lives
of
twelve
innocent
individuals
marked
out
as
political
victims
to
the
moloch
of
legitimacy
which
then
skulked
behind
a
british
throne
and
had
not
yet
dared
to
stalk
forth
as
it
has
done
since
from
its
in
the
face
of
day
to
brave
the
opinion
of
the
world
if
it
had
then
glutted
its
maw
with
its
intended
prey
the
sharpness
of
godwin
pen
cut
the
legal
cords
with
which
it
was
attempted
to
bind
them
it
might
have
done
so
sooner
and
with
more
lasting
effect
the
world
do
not
know
and
we
are
not
sure
but
the
intelligence
may
startle
godwin
himself
that
he
is
the
author
of
a
volume
of
sermons
and
of
a
life
of
chatham
c
fawcett
an
old
friend
and
of
our
author
and
who
always
spoke
of
his
writings
with
admiration
tinctured
with
wonder
used
to
mention
a
circumstance
with
respect
to
the
work
which
may
throw
some
light
on
the
history
and
progress
of
mind
he
was
anxious
to
make
his
biographical
account
as
complete
as
he
could
and
applied
for
this
purpose
to
many
of
his
acquaintance
to
furnish
him
with
anecdotes
or
to
suggest
criticisms
amongst
others
fawcett
repeated
to
him
what
he
thought
a
striking
passage
in
a
speech
on
delivered
by
lord
chatham
at
which
he
fawcett
had
been
present
every
man
house
said
this
emphatic
thinker
and
speaker
has
been
called
his
castle
and
why
is
it
called
his
castle
is
it
because
it
is
defended
by
a
wall
because
it
is
surrounded
with
a
moat
no
it
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
shed
it
may
be
open
to
all
the
elements
the
wind
may
enter
in
the
rain
may
enter
in
but
the
king
enter
in
his
friend
thought
that
the
point
was
here
palpable
enough
but
when
he
came
to
read
the
printed
volume
he
found
it
thus
every
man
house
is
his
castle
and
why
is
it
called
so
is
it
because
it
is
defended
by
a
wall
because
it
is
surrounded
with
a
moat
no
it
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
shed
it
may
be
exposed
to
all
the
elements
the
rain
may
enter
into
it
the
winds
of
heaven
may
whistle
round
but
the
king
can
not
this
was
what
fawcett
called
a
defect
of
he
at
the
same
time
admitted
that
godwin
had
improved
his
native
sterility
in
this
respect
or
atoned
for
it
by
incessant
activity
of
mind
and
by
accumulated
stores
of
thought
and
powers
of
language
in
fact
his
is
not
the
spontaneous
but
the
voluntary
exercise
of
talent
he
fixes
his
ambition
on
a
high
point
of
excellence
and
spares
no
pains
or
time
in
attaining
it
he
has
less
of
the
appearance
of
a
man
of
genius
than
any
one
who
has
given
such
decided
and
ample
proofs
of
it
he
is
ready
only
on
reflection
dangerous
only
at
the
rebound
he
gathers
himself
up
and
strains
every
nerve
and
faculty
with
deliberate
aim
to
some
heroic
and
dazzling
atchievement
of
intellect
but
he
must
make
a
career
before
he
flings
himself
armed
upon
the
enemy
or
he
is
sure
to
be
unhorsed
or
he
resembles
an
clock
that
must
be
wound
up
long
before
it
can
strike
therefore
his
powers
of
conversation
are
but
limited
he
has
neither
acuteness
of
remark
nor
a
flow
of
language
both
which
might
be
expected
from
his
writings
as
these
are
no
less
distinguished
by
a
sustained
and
impassioned
tone
of
declamation
than
by
novelty
of
opinion
or
brilliant
tracks
of
invention
in
company
horne
tooke
used
to
make
a
mere
child
of
him
or
of
any
man
godwin
liked
this
treatment
d
and
indeed
it
is
his
foible
to
fawn
on
those
who
use
him
and
to
be
cavalier
to
those
who
express
an
undue
or
unqualified
admiration
of
him
he
looks
up
with
unfeigned
respect
to
acknowledged
reputation
but
then
it
must
be
very
well
ascertained
before
he
admits
it
and
has
a
favourite
hypothesis
that
understanding
and
virtue
are
the
same
thing
godwin
possesses
a
high
degree
of
philosophical
candour
and
studiously
paid
the
homage
of
his
pen
and
person
to
malthus
sir
james
macintosh
and
parr
for
their
unsparing
attacks
on
him
but
woe
to
any
poor
devil
who
had
the
hardihood
to
defend
him
against
them
in
private
the
author
of
at
one
time
reminded
those
who
knew
him
of
the
metaphysician
engrafted
on
the
dissenting
minister
there
was
a
dictatorial
captious
quibbling
pettiness
of
manner
he
lost
this
with
the
first
blush
and
awkwardness
of
popularity
which
surprised
him
in
the
retirement
of
his
study
and
he
has
since
with
the
wear
and
tear
of
society
from
being
too
pragmatical
become
somewhat
too
careless
he
is
at
present
as
easy
as
an
old
glove
perhaps
there
is
a
little
attention
to
effect
in
this
and
he
wishes
to
appear
a
foil
to
himself
his
best
moments
are
with
an
intimate
acquaintance
or
two
when
he
gossips
in
a
fine
vein
about
old
authors
clarendon
of
the
or
burnet
of
his
own
and
you
perceive
by
your
host
talk
as
by
the
taste
of
seasoned
wine
that
he
has
a
in
his
understanding
godwin
also
has
a
correct
taste
in
poetry
and
the
drama
he
relishes
donne
and
ben
jonson
and
recites
a
passage
from
either
with
an
agreeable
mixture
of
pedantry
and
he
is
not
one
of
those
who
do
not
grow
wiser
with
opportunity
and
reflection
he
changes
his
opinions
and
changes
them
for
the
better
the
alteration
of
his
taste
in
poetry
from
an
exclusive
admiration
of
the
age
of
queen
anne
to
an
almost
equally
exclusive
one
of
that
of
elizabeth
is
we
suspect
owing
to
coleridge
who
some
twenty
years
ago
threw
a
great
stone
into
the
standing
pool
of
criticism
which
splashed
some
persons
with
the
mud
but
which
gave
a
motion
to
the
surface
and
a
reverberation
to
the
neighbouring
echoes
which
has
not
since
subsided
in
common
company
godwin
either
goes
to
sleep
himself
or
sets
others
to
sleep
he
is
at
present
engaged
in
a
history
of
the
commonwealth
of
perpetua
in
size
godwin
is
below
the
common
stature
nor
is
his
deportment
graceful
or
animated
his
face
is
however
fine
with
an
expression
of
placid
temper
and
recondite
thought
he
is
not
unlike
the
common
portraits
of
locke
there
is
a
very
admirable
likeness
of
him
by
northcote
which
with
a
more
heroic
and
dignified
air
only
does
justice
to
the
profound
sagacity
and
benevolent
aspirations
of
our
author
mind
godwin
has
kept
the
best
company
of
his
time
but
he
has
survived
most
of
the
celebrated
persons
with
whom
he
lived
in
habits
of
intimacy
he
speaks
of
them
with
enthusiasm
and
with
discrimination
and
sometimes
dwells
with
peculiar
delight
on
a
day
passed
at
john
kemble
in
company
with
sheridan
curran
wolstonecraft
and
inchbald
when
the
conversation
took
a
most
animated
turn
and
the
subject
was
of
love
of
all
these
our
author
is
the
only
one
remaining
frail
tenure
on
which
human
life
and
genius
are
lent
us
for
a
while
to
improve
or
to
enjoy

an

answered
by

christianity
had
a

used
to
object
to
this
striking

a
want
of
historical
correctness

as
the
animating
principle
of
the
true
chivalrous
character
was
the
sense
of
honour
not
the
mere
regard
to
or
saving
of

this
we
think
must
be
an
hypercriticism
from

remember

of

by

coleridge
the
present
is
an
age
of
talkers
and
not
of
doers
and
the
reason
is
that
the
world
is
growing
old
we
are
so
far
advanced
in
the
arts
and
sciences
that
we
live
in
retrospect
and
doat
on
past
atchievements
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
has
been
so
great
that
we
are
lost
in
wonder
at
the
height
it
has
reached
instead
of
attempting
to
climb
or
add
to
it
while
the
variety
of
objects
distracts
and
dazzles
the
what
remains
unoccupied
what
path
untried
what
is
the
use
of
doing
anything
unless
we
could
do
better
than
all
those
who
have
gone
before
us
what
hope
is
there
of
this
we
are
like
those
who
have
been
to
see
some
noble
monument
of
art
who
are
content
to
admire
without
thinking
of
rivalling
it
or
like
guests
after
a
feast
who
praise
the
hospitality
of
the
donor
and
thank
the
bounteous
pan
perhaps
carrying
away
some
trifling
fragments
or
like
the
spectators
of
a
mighty
battle
who
still
hear
its
sound
afar
off
and
the
clashing
of
armour
and
the
neighing
of
the
and
the
shout
of
victory
is
in
their
ears
like
the
rushing
of
innumerable
waters
coleridge
has
a
mind
reflecting
ages
past
his
voice
is
like
the
echo
of
the
congregated
roar
of
the
dark
rearward
and
abyss
of
thought
he
who
has
seen
a
mouldering
tower
by
the
side
of
a
chrystal
lake
hid
by
the
mist
but
glittering
in
the
wave
below
may
conceive
the
dim
gleaming
uncertain
intelligence
of
his
eye
he
who
has
marked
the
evening
clouds
uprolled
a
world
of
vapours
has
seen
the
picture
of
his
mind
unearthly
unsubstantial
with
gorgeous
tints
and
forms
that
which
was
now
a
horse
even
with
a
thought
the
rack
dislimns
and
makes
it
indistinct
as
water
is
in
water
our
author
mind
is
as
he
himself
might
express
it
there
is
no
subject
on
which
he
has
not
touched
none
on
which
he
has
rested
with
an
understanding
fertile
subtle
expansive
quick
forgetive
apprehensive
beyond
all
living
precedent
few
traces
of
it
will
perhaps
remain
he
lends
himself
to
all
impressions
alike
he
gives
up
his
mind
and
liberty
of
thought
to
none
he
is
a
general
lover
of
art
and
science
and
wedded
to
no
one
in
particular
he
pursues
knowledge
as
a
mistress
with
outstretched
hands
and
winged
speed
but
as
he
is
about
to
embrace
her
his
daphne
turns
alas
not
to
a
laurel
hardly
a
speculation
has
been
left
on
record
from
the
earliest
time
but
it
is
loosely
folded
up
in
coleridge
memory
like
a
rich
but
somewhat
tattered
piece
of
tapestry
we
might
add
with
more
seeming
than
real
extravagance
that
scarce
a
thought
can
pass
through
the
mind
of
man
but
its
sound
has
at
some
time
or
other
passed
over
his
head
with
rustling
pinions
on
whatever
question
or
author
you
speak
he
is
prepared
to
take
up
the
theme
with
advantage
from
peter
abelard
down
to
thomas
moore
from
the
subtlest
metaphysics
to
the
politics
of
the
there
is
no
man
of
genius
in
whose
praise
he
descants
but
the
critic
seems
to
stand
above
the
author
and
what
in
him
is
weak
to
strengthen
what
is
low
to
raise
and
support
nor
is
there
any
work
of
genius
that
does
not
come
out
of
his
hands
like
an
illuminated
missal
sparkling
even
in
its
defects
if
coleridge
had
not
been
the
most
impressive
talker
of
his
age
he
would
probably
have
been
the
finest
writer
but
he
lays
down
his
pen
to
make
sure
of
an
auditor
and
mortgages
the
admiration
of
posterity
for
the
stare
of
an
idler
if
he
had
not
been
a
poet
he
would
have
been
a
powerful
logician
if
he
had
not
dipped
his
wing
in
the
unitarian
controversy
he
might
have
soared
to
the
very
summit
of
fancy
but
in
writing
verse
he
is
trying
to
subject
the
muse
to
theories
in
his
abstract
reasoning
he
misses
his
way
by
strewing
it
with
flowers
all
that
he
has
done
of
moment
he
had
done
twenty
years
ago
since
then
he
may
be
said
to
have
lived
on
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
coleridge
is
too
rich
in
intellectual
wealth
to
need
to
task
himself
to
any
drudgery
he
has
only
to
draw
the
sliders
of
his
imagination
and
a
thousand
subjects
expand
before
him
startling
him
with
their
brilliancy
or
losing
themselves
in
endless
obscurity
and
by
the
force
of
blear
illusion
they
draw
him
on
to
his
confusion
what
is
the
little
he
could
add
to
the
stock
compared
with
the
countless
stores
that
lie
about
him
that
he
should
stoop
to
pick
up
a
name
or
to
polish
an
idle
fancy
he
walks
abroad
in
the
majesty
of
an
universal
understanding
eyeing
the
rich
strond
or
golden
sky
above
him
and
goes
sounding
on
his
way
in
eloquent
accents
uncompelled
and
free
persons
of
the
greatest
capacity
are
often
those
who
for
this
reason
do
the
least
for
surveying
themselves
from
the
highest
point
of
view
amidst
the
infinite
variety
of
the
universe
their
own
share
in
it
seems
trifling
and
scarce
worth
a
thought
and
they
prefer
the
contemplation
of
all
that
is
or
has
been
or
can
be
to
the
making
a
coil
about
doing
what
when
done
is
no
better
than
vanity
it
is
hard
to
concentrate
all
our
attention
and
efforts
on
one
pursuit
except
from
ignorance
of
others
and
without
this
concentration
of
our
faculties
no
great
progress
can
be
made
in
any
one
thing
it
is
not
merely
that
the
mind
is
not
capable
of
the
effort
it
does
not
think
the
effort
worth
making
action
is
one
but
thought
is
manifold
he
whose
restless
eye
glances
through
the
wide
compass
of
nature
and
art
will
not
consent
to
have
his
own
nothings
monstered
but
he
must
do
this
before
he
can
give
his
whole
soul
to
them
the
mind
after
letting
contemplation
have
its
fill
or
sailing
with
supreme
dominion
through
the
azure
deep
of
air
sinks
down
on
the
ground
breathless
exhausted
powerless
inactive
or
if
it
must
have
some
vent
to
its
feelings
seeks
the
most
easy
and
obvious
is
soothed
by
friendly
flattery
lulled
by
the
murmur
of
immediate
applause
thinks
as
it
were
aloud
and
babbles
in
its
dreams
a
scholar
so
to
speak
is
a
more
disinterested
and
abstracted
character
than
a
mere
author
the
first
looks
at
the
numberless
volumes
of
a
library
and
says
all
these
are
mine
the
other
points
to
a
single
volume
perhaps
it
may
be
an
immortal
one
and
says
my
name
is
written
on
the
back
of
it
this
is
a
puny
and
groveling
ambition
beneath
the
lofty
amplitude
of
coleridge
mind
no
he
revolves
in
his
wayward
soul
or
utters
to
the
passing
wind
or
discourses
to
his
own
shadow
things
mightier
and
more
various
let
us
draw
the
curtain
and
unlock
the
shrine
learning
rocked
him
in
his
cradle
and
while
yet
a
child
he
lisped
in
numbers
for
the
numbers
came
at
sixteen
he
wrote
his
on
and
he
still
reverts
to
that
period
with
delight
not
so
much
as
it
relates
to
himself
for
that
string
of
his
own
early
promise
of
fame
rather
jars
than
otherwise
but
as
exemplifying
the
youth
of
a
poet
coleridge
talks
of
himself
without
being
an
egotist
for
in
him
the
individual
is
always
merged
in
the
abstract
and
general
he
distinguished
himself
at
school
and
at
the
university
by
his
knowledge
of
the
classics
and
gained
several
prizes
for
greek
epigrams
how
many
men
are
there
great
scholars
celebrated
names
in
literature
who
having
done
the
same
thing
in
their
youth
have
no
other
idea
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
but
of
this
achievement
of
a
fellowship
and
dinner
and
who
installed
in
academic
honours
would
look
down
on
our
author
as
a
mere
strolling
bard
at
hospital
where
he
was
brought
up
he
was
the
idol
of
those
among
his
schoolfellows
who
mingled
with
their
bookish
studies
the
music
of
thought
and
of
humanity
and
he
was
usually
attended
round
the
cloisters
by
a
group
of
these
inspiring
and
inspired
whose
hearts
even
then
burnt
within
them
as
he
talked
and
where
the
sounds
yet
linger
to
mock
elia
on
his
way
still
turning
pensive
to
the
past
one
of
the
finest
and
rarest
parts
of
coleridge
conversation
is
when
he
expatiates
on
the
greek
tragedians
not
that
he
is
not
well
acquainted
when
he
pleases
with
the
epic
poets
or
the
philosophers
or
orators
or
historians
of
antiquity
on
the
subtle
reasonings
and
melting
pathos
of
euripides
on
the
harmonious
gracefulness
of
sophocles
tuning
his
song
like
sweetest
warblings
from
a
sacred
grove
on
the
eloquence
of
aeschylus
whose
prometheus
above
all
is
like
an
ode
to
fate
and
a
pleading
with
providence
his
thoughts
being
let
loose
as
his
body
is
chained
on
his
solitary
rock
and
his
afflicted
will
the
emblem
of
mortality
struggling
in
vain
with
ruthless
destiny
as
the
impassioned
critic
speaks
and
rises
in
his
theme
you
would
think
you
heard
the
voice
of
the
man
hated
by
the
gods
contending
with
the
wild
winds
as
they
roar
and
his
eye
glitters
with
the
spirit
of
antiquity
next
he
was
engaged
with
hartley
tribes
of
mind
etherial
braid
and
he
busied
himself
for
a
year
or
two
with
vibrations
and
vibratiuncles
and
the
great
law
of
association
that
binds
all
things
in
its
mystic
chain
and
the
doctrine
of
necessity
the
mild
teacher
of
charity
and
the
millennium
anticipative
of
a
life
to
come
and
he
plunged
deep
into
the
controversy
on
matter
and
spirit
and
as
an
escape
from
priestley
materialism
where
he
felt
himself
imprisoned
by
the
logician
spell
like
ariel
in
the
cloven
he
became
suddenly
enamoured
of
bishop
a
and
used
in
all
companies
to
build
the
universe
like
a
brave
poetical
fiction
of
fine
words
and
he
was
in
malebranche
and
in
cudworth
intellectual
system
a
huge
pile
of
learning
unwieldy
enormous
and
in
lord
brook
hieroglyphic
theories
and
in
bishop
butler
sermons
and
in
the
duchess
of
fantastic
folios
and
in
clarke
and
south
and
tillotson
and
all
the
fine
thinkers
and
masculine
reasoners
of
that
age
and
reared
its
arch
above
his
head
like
the
rainbow
in
the
cloud
covenanting
with
the
hopes
of
man
and
then
he
fell
plump
ten
thousand
fathoms
down
but
his
wings
saved
him
harmless
into
the
of
dissent
where
he
pared
religion
down
to
the
standard
of
reason
and
stripped
faith
of
mystery
and
preached
christ
crucified
and
the
unity
of
the
godhead
and
so
dwelt
for
a
while
in
the
spirit
with
john
huss
and
jerome
of
prague
and
socinus
and
old
john
zisca
and
ran
through
neal
history
of
the
puritans
and
memorial
having
like
thoughts
and
passions
with
them
but
then
spinoza
became
his
god
and
he
took
up
the
vast
chain
of
being
in
his
hand
and
the
round
world
became
the
centre
and
the
soul
of
all
things
in
some
shadowy
sense
forlorn
of
meaning
and
around
him
he
beheld
the
living
traces
and
the
proportions
of
the
mighty
pan
but
poetry
redeemed
him
from
this
spectral
philosophy
and
he
bathed
his
heart
in
beauty
and
gazed
at
the
golden
light
of
heaven
and
drank
of
the
spirit
of
the
universe
and
wandered
at
eve
by
or
fountain
when
he
saw
nought
but
beauty
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
that
almighty
one
in
every
breeze
that
blew
or
wave
that
murmured
and
wedded
with
truth
in
plato
shade
and
in
the
writings
of
proclus
and
plotinus
saw
the
ideas
of
things
in
the
eternal
mind
and
unfolded
all
mysteries
with
the
schoolmen
and
fathomed
the
depths
of
duns
scotus
and
thomas
aquinas
and
entered
the
third
heaven
with
jacob
behmen
and
walked
hand
in
hand
with
swedenborg
through
the
pavilions
of
the
new
jerusalem
and
sung
his
faith
in
the
promise
and
in
the
word
in
his
and
lowering
himself
from
that
dizzy
height
poised
himself
on
milton
wings
and
spread
out
his
thoughts
in
charity
with
the
glad
prose
of
jeremy
taylor
and
wept
over
bowles
sonnets
and
studied
cowper
blankverse
and
betook
himself
to
thomson
castle
of
indolence
and
sported
with
the
wits
of
charles
the
second
days
and
of
queen
anne
and
relished

style
and
that
of
the
john

we
mean
not

and
dallied
with
the
british
essayists
and
novelists
and
knew
all
qualities
of
more
modern
writers
with
a
learned
spirit
johnson
and
goldsmith
and
junius
and
burke
and
godwin
and
the
sorrows
of
werter
and
jean
jacques
rousseau
and
voltaire
and
marivaux
and
crebillon
and
thousands
more
now
laughed
with
rabelais
in
his
easy
chair
or
pointed
to
hogarth
or
afterwards
dwelt
on
claude
classic
scenes
or
spoke
with
rapture
of
raphael
and
compared
the
women
at
rome
to
figures
that
had
walked
out
of
his
pictures
or
visited
the
oratory
of
pisa
and
described
the
works
of
giotto
and
ghirlandaio
and
massaccio
and
gave
the
moral
of
the
picture
of
the
triumph
of
death
where
the
beggars
and
the
wretched
invoke
his
dreadful
dart
but
the
rich
and
mighty
of
the
earth
quail
and
shrink
before
it
and
in
that
land
of
siren
sights
and
sounds
saw
a
dance
of
peasant
girls
and
was
charmed
with
lutes
and
gondolas
or
wandered
into
germany
and
lost
himself
in
the
labyrinths
of
the
hartz
forest
and
of
the
kantean
philosophy
and
amongst
the
cabalistic
names
of
fichtè
and
schelling
and
lessing
and
god
knows
who
this
was
long
after
but
all
the
former
while
he
had
nerved
his
heart
and
filled
his
eyes
with
tears
as
he
hailed
the
rising
orb
of
liberty
since
quenched
in
darkness
and
in
blood
and
had
kindled
his
affections
at
the
blaze
of
the
french
revolution
and
sang
for
joy
when
the
towers
of
the
bastile
and
the
proud
places
of
the
insolent
and
the
oppressor
fell
and
would
have
floated
his
bark
freighted
with
fondest
fancies
across
the
atlantic
wave
with
southey
and
others
to
seek
for
peace
and
freedom

philarmonia
undivided

alas
frailty
thy
name
is
what
is
become
of
all
this
mighty
heap
of
hope
of
thought
of
learning
and
humanity
it
has
ended
in
swallowing
doses
of
oblivion
and
in
writing
paragraphs
in
the
such
and
so
little
is
the
mind
of
man
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
coleridge
could
keep
on
at
the
rate
he
set
off
he
could
not
realize
all
he
knew
or
thought
and
less
could
not
fix
his
desultory
ambition
other
stimulants
supplied
the
place
and
kept
up
the
intoxicating
dream
the
fever
and
the
madness
of
his
early
impressions
liberty

and
the
poet
bride
had
fallen
a
victim
meanwhile
to
the
murderous
practices
of
the
hag
legitimacy
proscribed
by
too
romantic
for
the
herd
of
vulgar
politicians
our
enthusiast
stood
at
bay
and
at
last
turned
on
the
pivot
of
a
subtle
casuistry
to
the
side
but
his
discursive
reason
would
not
let
him
trammel
himself
into
a
or
and
he
stopped
ere
he
had
quite
passed
that
bourne
from
whence
no
traveller
returns
and
so
has
sunk
into
torpid
uneasy
repose
tantalized
by
useless
resources
haunted
by
vain
imaginings
his
lips
idly
moving
but
his
heart
forever
still
or
as
the
shattered
chords
vibrate
of
themselves
making
melancholy
music
to
the
ear
of
memory
such
is
the
fate
of
genius
in
an
age
when
in
the
unequal
contest
with
sovereign
wrong
every
man
is
ground
to
powder
who
is
not
either
a
born
slave
or
who
does
not
willingly
and
at
once
offer
up
the
yearnings
of
humanity
and
the
dictates
of
reason
as
a
welcome
sacrifice
to
besotted
prejudice
and
loathsome
power
of
all
coleridge
productions
the
is
the
only
one
that
we
could
with
confidence
put
into
any
person
hands
on
whom
we
wished
to
impress
a
favourable
idea
of
his
extraordinary
powers
let
whatever
other
objections
be
made
to
it
it
is
unquestionably
a
work
of
genius
of
wild
irregular
overwhelming
imagination
and
has
that
rich
varied
movement
in
the
verse
which
gives
a
distant
idea
of
the
lofty
or
changeful
tones
of
coleridge
voice
in
the
there
is
one
splendid
passage
on
divided
friendship
the
of
schiller
is
also
a
masterly
production
in
its
kind
faithful
and
spirited
among
his
smaller
pieces
there
are
occasional
bursts
of
pathos
and
fancy
equal
to
what
we
might
expect
from
him
but
these
form
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
such
for
instance
is
his
affecting
sonnet
to
the
author
of
the
robbers
schiller
that
hour
i
would
have
wish
to
die
if
through
the
midnight
i
had
sent
from
the
dark
dungeon
of
the
tower
that
fearful
voice
a
famish
father
cry
that
in
no
aught
less
vast
might
stamp
me
mortal
a
triumphant
shout
black
horror
scream
and
all
her
goblin
rout

scene

ah
bard
tremendous
in
sublimity
could
i
behold
thee
in
thy
loftier
mood
at
eve
with
finely
frenzied
eye
beneath
some
vast
old
wood
awhile
with
mute
awe
gazing
i
would
brood
then
weep
aloud
in
a
wild
ecstasy
his
tragedy
entitled
is
full
of
beautiful
and
striking
passages
but
it
does
not
place
the
author
in
the
first
rank
of
dramatic
writers
but
if
coleridge
works
do
not
place
him
in
that
rank
they
injure
instead
of
conveying
a
just
idea
of
the
man
for
he
himself
is
certainly
in
the
first
class
of
general
intellect
if
our
author
poetry
is
inferior
to
his
conversation
his
prose
is
utterly
abortive
hardly
a
gleam
is
to
be
found
in
it
of
the
brilliancy
and
richness
of
those
stores
of
thought
and
language
that
he
pours
out
incessantly
when
they
are
lost
like
drops
of
water
in
the
ground
the
principal
work
in
which
he
has
attempted
to
embody
his
general
views
of
things
is
the
friend
of
which
though
it
contains
some
noble
passages
and
fine
trains
of
thought
prolixity
and
obscurity
are
the
most
frequent
characteristics
no
two
persons
can
be
conceived
more
opposite
in
character
or
genius
than
the
subject
of
the
present
and
of
the
preceding
sketch
godwin
with
less
natural
capacity
and
with
fewer
acquired
advantages
by
concentrating
his
mind
on
some
given
object
and
doing
what
he
had
to
do
with
all
his
might
has
accomplished
much
and
will
leave
more
than
one
monument
of
a
powerful
intellect
behind
him
coleridge
by
dissipating
his
and
dallying
with
every
subject
by
turns
has
done
little
or
nothing
to
justify
to
the
world
or
to
posterity
the
high
opinion
which
all
who
have
ever
heard
him
converse
or
known
him
intimately
with
one
accord
entertain
of
him
godwin
faculties
have
kept
house
and
plied
their
task
in
the
of
the
brain
diligently
and
effectually
coleridge
have
gossipped
away
their
time
and
gadded
about
from
house
to
house
as
if
life
business
were
to
melt
the
hours
in
listless
talk
godwin
is
intent
on
a
subject
only
as
it
concerns
himself
and
his
reputation
he
works
it
out
as
a
matter
of
duty
and
discards
from
his
mind
whatever
does
not
forward
his
main
object
as
impertinent
and
vain
coleridge
on
the
other
hand
delights
in
nothing
but
episodes
and
digressions
neglects
whatever
he
undertakes
to
perform
and
can
act
only
on
spontaneous
impulses
without
object
or
method
he
can
not
be
constrained
by
mastery
while
he
should
be
occupied
with
a
given
pursuit
he
is
thinking
of
a
thousand
other
things
a
thousand
tastes
a
thousand
objects
tempt
him
and
distract
his
mind
which
keeps
open
house
and
entertains
all
comers
and
after
being
fatigued
and
amused
with
morning
calls
from
idle
visitors
finds
the
day
consumed
and
its
business
unconcluded
godwin
on
the
contrary
is
somewhat
exclusive
and
unsocial
in
his
habits
of
mind
entertains
no
company
but
what
he
gives
his
whole
time
and
attention
to
and
wisely
writes
over
the
doors
of
his
understanding
his
fancy
and
his
senses
no
admittance
except
on
business
he
has
none
of
that
fastidious
refinement
and
false
delicacy
which
might
lead
him
to
balance
between
the
endless
variety
of
modern
attainments
he
does
not
throw
away
his
life
nor
a
single
of
it
in
adjusting
the
claims
of
different
accomplishments
and
in
choosing
between
them
or
making
himself
master
of
them
all
he
sets
about
his
task
whatever
it
may
be
and
goes
through
it
with
spirit
and
fortitude
he
has
the
happiness
to
think
an
author
the
greatest
character
in
the
world
and
himself
the
greatest
author
in
it
coleridge
in
writing
an
harmonious
stanza
would
stop
to
consider
whether
there
was
not
more
grace
and
beauty
in
a
de
and
would
not
proceed
till
he
had
resolved
this
question
by
a
chain
of
metaphysical
reasoning
without
end
not
so
godwin
that
is
best
to
him
which
he
can
do
best
he
does
not
waste
himself
in
vain
aspirations
and
effeminate
sympathies
he
is
blind
deaf
insensible
to
all
but
the
trump
of
fame
plays
operas
painting
music
wealth
fashion
titles
lords
ladies
touch
him
not
all
these
are
no
more
to
him
than
to
the
magician
in
his
cell
and
he
writes
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
through
good
report
and
evil
report
in
is
his
motto
he
neither
envies
nor
admires
what
others
are
but
is
contented
to
be
what
he
is
and
strives
to
do
the
utmost
he
can
coleridge
has
flirted
with
the
muses
as
with
a
set
of
mistresses
godwin
has
been
married
twice
to
reason
and
to
fancy
and
has
to
boast
no
progeny
by
each
so
to
speak
he
has
belonging
to
his
mind
to
regulate
the
quantity
of
gas
admitted
into
it
so
that
like
the
bare
unsightly
but
it
cuts
its
liquid
way
and
arrives
at
its
promised
end
while
coleridge
bark
taught
with
the
little
nautilus
to
sail
the
sport
of
every
breath
dancing
to
every
wave
youth
at
its
prow
and
pleasure
at
its
helm
flutters
its
gaudy
pennons
in
the
air
glitters
in
the
sun
but
we
wait
in
vain
to
hear
of
its
arrival
in
the
destined
harbour
godwin
with
less
variety
and
vividness
with
less
subtlety
and
susceptibility
both
of
thought
and
feeling
has
had
firmer
nerves
a
more
determined
purpose
a
more
comprehensive
grasp
of
his
subject
and
the
results
are
as
we
find
them
each
has
met
with
his
reward
for
justice
has
after
all
been
done
to
the
pretensions
of
each

in
all
cases
use

footnote
a
coleridge
named
his
eldest
son
the
writer
of
some
beautiful
sonnets
after
hartley
and
the
second
after
berkeley
the
third
was
called
derwent
after
the
river
of
that
name
nothing
can
be
more
characteristic
of
his
mind
than
this
circumstance
all
his
ideas
indeed
are
like
a
river
flowing
on
for
ever
and
still
murmuring
as
it
flows
discharging
its
waters
and
still
replenished
and
so
by
many
winding
nooks
it
strays
with
willing
sport
to
the
wild
ocean
rev
irving
this
gentleman
has
gained
an
almost
unprecedented
and
not
an
altogether
unmerited
popularity
as
a
preacher
as
he
is
perhaps
though
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
not
one
of
the
fixed
we
shall
take
this
opportunity
of
discussing
his
merits
while
he
is
at
his
meridian
height
and
in
doing
so
shall
nothing
extenuate
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
few
circumstances
shew
the
prevailing
and
preposterous
rage
for
novelty
in
a
more
striking
point
of
view
than
the
success
of
oratory
people
go
to
hear
him
in
crowds
and
come
away
with
a
mixture
of
delight
and
astonishment
they
go
again
to
see
if
the
effect
will
continue
and
send
others
to
try
to
find
out
the
mystery
and
in
the
noisy
conflict
between
extravagant
encomiums
and
splenetic
objections
the
true
secret
escapes
observation
which
is
that
the
whole
thing
is
nearly
from
beginning
to
end
a
of
if
the
subject
of
these
remarks
had
come
out
as
a
player
with
all
his
advantages
of
figure
voice
and
action
we
think
he
would
have
failed
if
as
a
preacher
he
had
kept
within
the
strict
bounds
of
he
would
scarcely
have
been
much
distinguished
among
his
calvinistic
brethren
as
a
mere
author
he
would
have
excited
attention
rather
by
his
quaintness
and
affectation
of
an
obsolete
style
and
mode
of
thinking
than
by
any
thing
else
but
he
has
contrived
to
jumble
these
several
characters
together
in
an
and
unwarranted
manner
and
the
fascination
is
altogether
irresistible
our
caledonian
divine
is
equally
an
anomaly
in
religion
in
literature
in
personal
appearance
and
in
public
speaking
to
hear
a
person
spout
shakspeare
on
the
stage
is
nothing
the
charm
is
nearly
worn
out
but
to
hear
any
one
spout
shakspeare
and
that
not
in
a
sneaking
but
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
with
the
full
breadth
of
his
chest
from
a
calvinistic
pulpit
is
new
and
wonderful
the

lately
lost
something
of
their
gloss
in
public
estimation
and
after
the
last
fight
few
would
go
far
to
see
a
neat
or
a
spring
but
to
see
a
man
who
is
able
to
enter
the
ring
with
either
of
them
or

a
to
a
cabinet
minister
there
is
something
in
a
sight
like
this
also
that
is
a
cure
for
sore
eyes
it
is
as
if
crib
or
molyneux
had
turned
methodist
parson
or
as
if
a
patagonian
savage
were
to
come
forward
as
the
of
evangelical
religion
again
the
doctrine
of
eternal
punishment
was
one
of
the
staple
arguments
with
which
everlastingly
drawled
out
the
old
school
of
presbyterian
divines
used
to
keep
their
audiences
awake
or
lull
them
to
sleep
but
to
which
people
of
taste
and
fashion
paid
little
attention
as
inelegant
and
barbarous
till
irving
with
his
features
and
blows
puffing
like
a
grim
vulcan
set
to
work
to
forge
more
classic
thunderbolts
and
kindle
the
expiring
flames
anew
with
the
very
sweepings
of
sceptical
and
infidel
libraries
so
as
to
excite
a
pleasing
horror
in
the
female
part
of
his
congregation
in
short
our
popular
declaimer
has
contrary
to
the
put
new

into
old
bottles
or
new

on
old
garments
he
has
with
an
unlimited
and
daring
licence
mixed
the
sacred
and
the
profane
together
the
carnal
and
the
spiritual
man
the
petulance
of
the
bar
with
the
dogmatism
of
the
pulpit
the
theatrical
and
theological
the
modern
and
the
obsolete
what
wonder
that
this
splendid
piece
of
patchwork
splendid
by
contradiction
and
contrast
has
delighted
some
and
confounded
others
the
more
serious
part
of
his
congregation
indeed
complain
though
not
bitterly
that
their
pastor
has
converted
their
into
a
but
when
a
lady
of
quality
introducing
herself
and
her
three
daughters
to
the
preacher
assures
him
that
they
have
been
to
all
the
most
fashionable
places
of
resort
the
opera
the
theatre
assemblies
miss
macauley
readings
and
and
have
been
equally
entertained
no
where
else
we
apprehend
that
no
remonstrances
of
a
committee
of
will
be
able
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
again
or
make
him
forego
such
sweet
but
praise
what
we
mean
to
insist
upon
is
that
irving
owes
his
triumphant
success
not
to
any
one
quality
for
which
he
has
been
extolled
but
to
a
combination
of
qualities
the
more
striking
in
their
immediate
effect
in
proportion
as
they
are
and
heterogeneous
like
the
violent
opposition
of
light
and
shade
in
a
picture
we
shall
endeavour
to
explain
this
view
of
the
subject
more
at
large
irving
then
is
no
common
or
mean
man
he
has
four
or
five
qualities
possessed
in
a
moderate
or
in
a
paramount
degree
which
added
or
multiplied
together
fill
up
the
important
space
he
occupies
in
the
public
eye
irving
intellect
itself
is
of
a
superior
order
he
has
undoubtedly
both
talents
and
acquirements
beyond
the
ordinary
run
of
preachers
these
alone
however
we
hold
would
not
account
for
a
twentieth
part
of
the
effect
he
has
produced
they
would
have
lifted
him
perhaps
out
of
the
mire
and
slough
of
sordid
obscurity
but
would
never
have
launched
him
into
the
of
popularity
in
which
he
lies
floating
many
a
rood
but
to
these
he
adds
uncommon
height
a
graceful
figure
and
action
a
clear
and
powerful
voice
a
striking
if
not
a
fine
face
a
bold
and
fiery
spirit
and
a
most
portentous
obliquity
of
vision
which
throw
him
to
an
immeasurable
distance
beyond
all
competition
and
effectually
relieve
whatever
there
might
be
of
or
bombast
in
his
style
of
composition
put
the
case
that
irving
had
been
five
feet
high
would
he
ever
have
been
heard
of
or
as
he
does
now
have
bestrode
the
world
like
a
colossus
no
the
thing
speaks
for
itself
he
would
in
vain
have
lifted
his
lilliputian
arm
to
heaven
people
would
have
laughed
at
his
again
had
he
been
as
tall
as
he
is
but
had
wanted
other
recommendations
he
would
have
been
nothing
the
player
province
they
but
vainly
try
who
want
these
powers
deportment
voice
and
eye
conceive
a
rough
ugly
scotchman
standing
up
in
the
caledonian
chapel
and
dealing
damnation
round
the
land
in
a
broad
northern
dialect
and
with
a
harsh
screaking
voice
what
ear
polite
what
smile
serene
would
have
hailed
the
barbarous
prodigy
or
not
consigned
him
to
utter
neglect
and
derision
but
the
rev
edward
irving
with
all
his
native
wildness
hath
a
smooth
aspect
framed
to
make
women
saints
his
very
unusual
size
and
height
are
carried
off
and
moulded
into
elegance
by
the
most
admirable
symmetry
of
form
and
ease
of
gesture
his
sable
locks
his
clear
complexion
and
features
turn
the
raw
uncouth
scotchman
into
the
likeness
of
a
noble
italian
picture
and
even
his
distortion
of
sight
only
redeems
the
otherwise
faultless
monster
within
the
bounds
of
humanity
and
when
admiration
is
exhausted
and
curiosity
ceases
excites
a
new
interest
by
leading
to
the
idle
question
whether
it
is
an
advantage
to
the
preacher
or
not
farther
give
him
all
his
actual
and
remarkable
advantages
of
body
and
mind
let
him
be
as
tall
as
strait
as
dark
and
clear
of
skin
as
much
at
his
ease
as
as
eloquent
and
as
argumentative
as
he
is
yet
with
all
these
and
without
a
little
charlatanery
to
set
them
off
he
had
been
nothing
he
might
keeping
within
the
rigid
line
of
his
duty
and
professed
calling
have
preached
on
for
ever
he
might
have
divided
the
doctrines
of
election
grace
reprobation
predestination
into
his
sixteenth
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
heads
and
his
have
been
looked
for
as
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
he
might
have
defied
the
devil
and
all
his
works
and
by
the
help
of
a
loud
voice
and
person
a
lusty
man
to
ben
an
abbot
able
have
increased
his
own
congregation
and
been
quoted
among
the
godly
as
a
powerful
preacher
of
the
word
but
in
addition
to
this
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
attack
jeremy
bentham
and
the
town
was
up
in
arms
the
thing
was
new
he
thus
wiped
the
stain
of
musty
ignorance
and
formal
bigotry
out
of
his
style
irving
must
have
something
superior
in
him
to
look
over
the
shining
heads
of
his
congregation
to
have
a
hit
at
the
in
his
study
he
next
ere
the
report
of
the
former
blow
had
subsided
made
a
lunge
at
brougham
and
glanced
an
eye
at
canning
coleridge
and
lord
liverpool
in
his
place
in
the
gallery
it
was
rare
sport
to
see
him
like
an
eagle
in
a
dovecote
flutter
the
volscians
in
corioli
he
has
found
out
the
secret
of
attracting
by
repelling
those
whom
he
is
likely
to
attack
are
curious
to
hear
what
he
says
of
them
they
go
again
to
show
that
they
do
not
mind
it
it
is
no
less
interesting
to
the
who
like
to
witness
this
sort
of
like
a
charge
of
cavalry
the
shock
and
the
resistance
irving
has
in
fact
without
leave
asked
or
a
licence
granted
converted
the
caledonian
chapel
into
a
westminster
forum
or
debating
society
with
the
sanctity
of
religion
added
to
it
our
spirited
polemic
is
not
contented
to
defend
the
citadel
of
orthodoxy
against
all
impugners
and
shut
himself
up
in
texts
of
scripture
and
huge
volumes
of
the
commentators
as
an
impregnable
fortress
he
merely
makes
use
of
the
stronghold
of
religion
as
a
from
which
he
sallies
forth
armed
with
modern
topics
and
with
penal
fire
like
achilles
of
old
rushing
from
the
grecian
tents
against
the
adversaries
of
god
and
man
peter
aretine
is
said
to
have
laid
the
princes
of
europe
under
contribution
by
penning
satires
against
them
so
irving
keeps
the
public
in
awe
by
insulting
all
their
favourite
idols
he
does
not
spare
their
politicians
their
rulers
their
moralists
their
poets
their
players
their
critics
their
reviewers
their
he
levels
their
resorts
of
business
their
places
of
amusement
at
a
blow
their
cities
churches
palaces
ranks
and
professions
refinements
and
elegances
and
leaves
nothing
standing
but
himself
a
mighty
landmark
in
a
degenerate
age
overlooking
the
wide
havoc
he
has
made
he
makes
war
upon
all
arts
and
sciences
upon
the
faculties
and
nature
of
man
on
his
vices
and
his
virtues
on
all
existing
institutions
and
all
possible
improvements
that
nothing
may
be
left
but
the
kirk
of
scotland
and
that
he
may
be
the
head
of
it
he
literally
sends
a
challenge
to
all
london
in
the
name
of
the
king
of
heaven
to
evacuate
its
streets
to
disperse
its
population
to
lay
aside
its
employments
to
burn
its
wealth
to
renounce
its
vanities
and
pomp
and
for
what
that
he
may
enter
in
as
the
of
or
after
enforcing
his
threat
with
the
of
logic
the
of
rhetoric
and
the
crossfire
of
his
double
vision
reduce
the
british
metropolis
to
a
scottish
heath
with
a
few
miserable
hovels
upon
it
where
they
may
worship
god
according
to
root
of
the
and
an
old
man
with
a
blue
bonnet
a
girl
and
a
little
child
would
form
the
flower
of
his
flock
such
is
the
pretension
and
the
boast
of
this
new
peter
the
hermit
who
would
get
rid
of
all
we
have
done
in
the
way
of
improvement
on
a
state
of
barbarous
ignorance
or
still
more
barbarous
prejudice
in
order
to
begin
again
on
a
of
calvinism
and
have
a
world
of
his
own
making
it
is
not
very
surprising
that
when
nearly
the
whole
mass
and
texture
of
civil
society
is
indicted
as
a
nuisance
and
threatened
to
be
pulled
down
as
a
rotten
building
ready
to
fall
on
the
heads
of
the
inhabitants
that
all
classes
of
people
run
to
hear
the
crash
and
to
see
the
engines
and
levers
at
work
which
are
to
effect
this
laudable
purpose
what
else
can
be
the
meaning
of
our
taking
upon
himself
to
denounce
the
sentiments
of
the
most
serious
professors
in
great
cities
as
vitiated
and
of
relegating
religion
to
his
native
glens
and
pretending
that
the
hymn
of
praise
or
the
sigh
of
contrition
can
not
ascend
acceptably
to
the
throne
of
grace
from
the
crowded
street
as
well
as
from
the
barren
rock
or
silent
valley
why
put
this
affront
upon
his
hearers
why
belie
his
own
aspirations
god
made
the
country
and
man
made
the
town
so
says
the
poet
does
irving
say
so
if
he
does
and
finds
the
air
of
the
city
death
to
his
piety
why
does
he
not
return
home
again
but
if
he
can
breathe
it
with
impunity
and
still
retain
the
fervour
of
his
early
enthusiasm
and
the
simplicity
and
purity
of
the
faith
that
was
once
delivered
to
the
saints
why
not
extend
the
benefit
of
his
own
experience
to
others
instead
of
taunting
them
with
a
vapid
pastoral
theory
or
if
our
popular
and
eloquent
divine
finds
a
change
in
himself
that
flattery
prevents
the
growth
of
grace
that
he
is
becoming
the
god
of
his
own
idolatry
by
being
that
of
others
that
the
glittering
of
rolling
down
to
hatton
garden
that
titled
beauty
that
the
parliamentary
complexion
of
his
audience
the
compliments
of
poets
and
the
stare
of
peers
discompose
his
wandering
thoughts
a
little
and
yet
that
he
can
not
give
up
these
strong
temptations
tugging
at
his
heart
why
not
extend
more
charity
to
others
and
shew
more
candour
in
speaking
of
himself
there
is
either
a
good
deal
of
bigoted
intolerance
with
a
deplorable
want
of
in
all
this
or
at
least
an
equal
degree
of
cant
and
quackery
to
whichever
cause
we
are
to
attribute
this
hyperbolical
tone
we
hold
it
certain
he
could
not
have
adopted
it
if
he
had
been
little
but
his
imposing
figure
and
dignified
manner
enable
him
to
hazard
sentiments
or
assertions
that
would
be
fatal
to
others
his
controversial
daring
is
by
his
bodily
prowess
and
by
bringing
his
intellectual
pretensions
boldly
into
a
line
with
his
physical
accomplishments
he
indeed
presents
a
very
formidable
front
to
the
sceptic
or
the
scoffer
take
a
cubit
from
his
stature
and
his
whole
manner
resolves
itself
into
an
impertinence
but
with
that
addition
he
the
town
browbeats
their
prejudices
and
bullies
them
out
of
their
senses
and
is
not
afraid
of
being
contradicted
by
any
one
than
it
may
be
said
that
individuals
with
great
personal
defects
have
made
a
considerable
figure
as
public
speakers
and
wilberforce
among
others
may
be
held
out
as
an
instance
nothing
can
be
more
insignificant
as
to
mere
outward
appearance
and
yet
he
is
listened
to
in
the
house
of
commons
but
he
does
not
wield
it
he
does
not
insult
or
bully
it
he
leads
by
following
opinion
he
trims
he
shifts
he
glides
on
the
silvery
sounds
of
his
undulating
flexible
cautiously
modulated
voice
winding
his
way
betwixt
heaven
and
earth
now
courting
popularity
now
calling
servility
to
his
aid
and
with
a
large
estate
the
saints
and
the
population
of
yorkshire
to
swell
his
influence
never
venturing
on
the
forlorn
hope
or
doing
any
thing
more
than
hitting
the
house
between
wind
and
water
yet
he
is
probably
a
cleverer
man
than
irving
there
is
a
fox
a
dissenting
minister
as
fluent
a
speaker
with
a
sweeter
voice
and
a
more
animated
and
beneficent
countenance
than
irving
who
expresses
himself
with
manly
spirit
at
a
public
meeting
takes
a
hand
at
whist
and
is
the
darling
of
his
congregation
but
he
is
no
more
because
he
is
diminutive
in
person
his
head
is
not
seen
above
the
crowd
the
length
of
a
street
off
he
is
the
duke
of
sussex
in
miniature
but
the
duke
of
sussex
does
not
go
to
hear
him
preach
as
he
attends
irving
who
rises
up
against
him
like
a
martello
tower
and
is
nothing
loth
to
confront
the
spirit
of
a
man
of
genius
with
the
we
allow
there
are
or
may
be
talents
sufficient
to
produce
this
equality
without
a
single
personal
advantage
but
we
deny
that
this
would
be
the
effect
of
any
that
our
great
preacher
possesses
we
conceive
it
not
improbable
that
the
consciousness
of
muscular
power
that
the
admiration
of
his
person
by
strangers
might
first
have
inspired
irving
with
an
ambition
to
be
something
intellectually
speaking
and
have
given
him
confidence
to
attempt
the
greatest
things
he
has
not
failed
for
want
of
courage
the
public
as
well
as
the
fair
are
won
by
a
show
of
gallantry
irving
has
shrunk
from
no
opinion
however
paradoxical
he
has
scrupled
to
avow
no
sentiment
however
obnoxious
he
has
revived
exploded
prejudices
he
has
scouted
prevailing
fashions
he
has
opposed
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
not
consulted
the
de
he
has
brought
back
the
doctrines
of
calvinism
in
all
their
inveteracy
and
relaxed
the
inveteracy
of
his
northern
accents
he
has
turned
religion
and
the
caledonian
chapel
he
has
held
a
in
one
hand
and
a
bible
in
the
other
and
quoted
shakspeare
and
melancthon
in
the
same
breath
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
is
no
longer
with
his
grafting
a
dry
withered
stump
it
shoots
its
branches
to
the
skies
and
hangs
out
its
blossoms
to
the
gale
miraturque
novos
fructus
et
non
sua
poma
he
has
taken
the
thorns
and
briars
of
scholastic
divinity
and
garlanded
them
with
the
flowers
of
modern
literature
he
has
done
all
this
relying
on
the
strength
of
a
remarkably
fine
person
and
manner
and
through
that
he
has
succeeded
otherwise
he
would
have
perished
miserably
chalmers
is
not
by
any
means
so
good
a
looking
man
nor
so
accomplished
a
speaker
as
irving
yet
he
at
one
time
almost
equalled
his
oratorical
celebrity
and
certainly
paved
the
way
for
him
he
has
therefore
more
merit
than
his
admired
pupil
as
he
has
done
as
much
with
fewer
means
he
has
more
scope
of
intellect
and
more
intensity
of
purpose
both
his
matter
and
his
manner
setting
aside
his
face
and
figure
are
more
impressive
take
the
volume
of
sermons
on
astronomy
by
chalmers
and
the
four
orations
for
the
oracles
of
god
which
irving
lately
published
and
we
apprehend
there
can
be
no
comparison
as
to
their
success
the
first
ran
like
through
the
country
were
the
darlings
of
were
laid
in
the
windows
of
inns
a
and
were
to
be
met
with
in
all
places
of
public
resort
while
the
orations
get
on
but
slowly
on
milton
stilts
and
are
pompously
announced
as
in
a
third
edition
we
believe
the
fairest
and
fondest
of
his
admirers
would
rather
see
and
hear
irving
than
read
him
the
reason
is
that
the
groundwork
of
his
compositions
is
trashy
and
hackneyed
though
set
off
by
extravagant
metaphors
and
an
affected
phraseology
that
without
the
turn
of
his
head
and
wave
of
his
hand
his
periods
have
nothing
in
them
and
that
he
himself
is
the
only
with
which
he
has
yet
enriched
the
public
mind
he
must
play
off
his
person
as
orator
henley
used
to
dazzle
his
hearers
with
his
the
small
frontispiece
prefixed
to
the
orations
does
not
serve
to
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
magnitude
of
the
man
nor
of
the
ease
and
freedom
of
his
motions
in
the
pulpit
how
different
is
chalmers
he
is
like
a
to
the
other
he
can
not
boast
of
personal
appearance
to
set
him
off
but
then
he
is
like
the
very
genius
or
demon
of
theological
controversy
personified
he
has
neither
airs
nor
graces
at
command
he
thinks
nothing
of
himself
he
has
nothing
theatrical
about
him
which
can
not
be
said
of
his
successor
and
rival
but
you
see
a
man
in
mortal
throes
and
agony
with
doubts
and
difficulties
seizing
stubborn
knotty
points
with
his
teeth
tearing
them
with
his
hands
and
straining
his
eyeballs
till
they
almost
start
out
of
their
sockets
in
pursuit
of
a
train
of
visionary
reasoning
like
a
with
his
second
sight
the
description
of
balfour
of
burley
in
his
cave
with
his
bible
in
one
hand
and
his
sword
in
the
other
contending
with
the
imaginary
enemy
of
mankind
gasping
for
breath
and
with
the
cold
moisture
running
down
his
face
gives
a
lively
idea
of
chalmers
prophetic
fury
in
the
pulpit
if
we
could
have
looked
in
to
have
seen
burley
by
the
coinage
of
his
brain
who
would
have
asked
whether
he
was
a
handsome
man
or
not
it
would
be
enough
to
see
a
man
haunted
by
a
spirit
under
the
strong
and
entire
dominion
of
a
wilful
hallucination
so
the
integrity
and
vehemence
of
chalmers
manner
the
determined
way
in
which
he
gives
himself
up
to
his
subject
or
lays
about
him
and
buffets
sceptics
and
gainsayers
arrests
attention
in
spite
of
every
other
circumstance
and
fixes
it
on
that
and
that
alone
which
excites
such
interest
and
such
eagerness
in
his
own
breast
besides
he
is
a
logician
has
a
theory
in
support
of
whatever
he
chooses
to
advance
and
weaves
the
tissue
of
his
sophistry
so
close
and
intricate
that
it
is
difficult
not
to
be
entangled
in
it
or
to
escape
from
it
magic
in
the
web
whatever
appeals
to
the
pride
of
the
human
understanding
has
a
subtle
charm
in
it
the
mind
is
naturally
pugnacious
can
not
refuse
a
challenge
of
strength
or
skill
sturdily
enters
the
lists
and
resolves
to
conquer
or
to
yield
itself
vanquished
in
the
forms
this
is
the
chief
hold
chalmers
had
upon
his
hearers
and
upon
the
readers
of
his
astronomical
discourses
no
one
was
satisfied
with
his
arguments
no
one
could
answer
them
but
every
one
wanted
to
try
what
he
could
make
of
them
as
we
try
to
find
out
a
riddle
by
his
so
potent
art
the
art
of
laying
down
problematical
premises
and
drawing
from
them
still
more
doubtful
but
not
impossible
conclusions
he
could
bedim
the
noonday
sun
betwixt
the
green
sea
and
the
azure
vault
set
roaring
war
and
almost
compel
the
stars
in
their
courses
to
testify
to
his
opinions
the
mode
in
which
he
undertook
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
universe
and
demand
categorical
information
now
of
the
planetary
and
now
of
the
fixed
might
put
one
in
mind
of
hecate
mode
of
ascending
in
a
machine
from
the
stage
midst
troops
of
spirits
in
which
you
now
admire
the
skill
of
the
artist
and
next
tremble
for
the
fate
of
the
performer
fearing
that
the
audacity
of
the
attempt
will
turn
his
head
or
break
his
neck
the
style
of
these
discourses
also
though
not
elegant
or
poetical
was
like
the
subject
intricate
and
endless
it
was
that
of
a
man
pushing
his
way
through
a
labyrinth
of
difficulties
and
determined
not
to
flinch
the
impression
on
the
reader
was
proportionate
for
whatever
were
the
merits
of
the
style
or
matter
both
were
new
and
striking
and
the
train
of
thought
that
was
unfolded
at
such
length
and
with
such
strenuousness
was
bold
and
consistent
with
itself
irving
wants
the
continuity
of
thought
and
manner
which
distinguishes
his
rival
and
shines
by
patches
and
in
bursts
he
does
not
warm
or
acquire
increasing
force
or
rapidity
with
his
progress
he
is
never
hurried
away
by
a
deep
or
lofty
enthusiasm
nor
touches
the
highest
point
of
genius
or
fanaticism
but
in
the
very
storm
and
whirlwind
of
his
passion
he
acquires
and
begets
a
temperance
that
may
give
it
smoothness
he
has
the
and
masterly
execution
of
an
experienced
player
or
fencer
and
does
not
seem
to
express
his
natural
convictions
or
to
be
engaged
in
a
mortal
struggle
this
greater
ease
and
indifference
is
the
result
of
vast
superiority
of
personal
appearance
which
to
be
admired
needs
but
to
be
seen
and
does
not
require
the
possessor
to
work
himself
up
into
a
passion
or
to
use
any
violent
contortions
to
gain
attention
or
to
keep
it
these
two
celebrated
preachers
are
in
almost
all
respects
an
antithesis
to
each
other
if
irving
is
an
example
of
what
can
be
done
by
the
help
of
external
advantages
chalmers
is
a
proof
of
what
can
be
done
without
them
the
one
is
most
indebted
to
his
mind
the
other
to
his
body
if
irving
inclines
one
to
suspect
fashionable
or
popular
religion
of
a
little
chalmers
effectually
redeems
it
from
that
scandal
footnote
a
we
remember
finding
the
volume
in
the
orchard
at
near
boxhill
and
passing
a
whole
and
very
delightful
morning
in
reading
it
without
quitting
the
shade
of
an
we
have
not
been
able
to
pay
irving
back
the
same
compliment
of
reading
it
at
a
sitting
the
late
horne
tooke
horne
tooke
was
one
of
those
who
may
be
considered
as
connecting
links
between
a
former
period
and
the
existing
generation
his
education
and
accomplishments
nay
his
political
opinions
were
of
the
last
age
his
mind
and
the
tone
of
his
feelings
were
there
was
a
hard
dry
materialism
in
the
very
texture
of
his
understanding
varnished
over
by
the
external
refinements
of
the
old
school
tooke
had
great
scope
of
attainment
and
great
versatility
of
pursuit
but
the
same
shrewdness
quickness
cool
the
same
of
perception
and
absence
of
passion
and
enthusiasm
characterised
nearly
all
he
did
said
or
wrote
he
was
without
a
rival
almost
in
private
conversation
an
expert
public
speaker
a
keen
politician
a
grammarian
and
the
finest
gentleman
to
say
the
least
of
his
own
party
he
had
no
imagination
or
he
would
not
have
scorned
it
no
delicacy
of
taste
no
rooted
prejudices
or
strong
attachments
his
intellect
was
like
a
bow
of
polished
steel
from
which
he
shot
poisoned
arrows
at
his
friends
in
private
at
his
enemies
in
public
his
mind
so
to
speak
had
no
in
it
and
very
little
even
of
the
moral
qualities
of
genius
but
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
a
scholar
bred
and
a
most
acute
and
powerful
logician
he
was
also
a
wit
and
a
formidable
one
yet
it
may
be
questioned
whether
his
wit
was
any
thing
more
than
an
excess
of
his
logical
faculty
it
did
not
consist
in
the
play
of
fancy
but
in
close
and
cutting
combinations
of
the
understanding
the
law
is
open
to
every
one
said
tooke
the
london
it
is
the
previous
deduction
formed
in
the
mind
and
the
splenetic
contempt
felt
for
a
practical
sophism
that
about
the
bush
and
at
last
finds
the
apt
illustration
not
the
casual
glancing
coincidence
of
two
objects
that
points
out
an
absurdity
to
the
understanding
so
on
another
occasion
when
sir
allan
gardiner
who
was
a
candidate
for
westminster
had
objected
to
fox
that
he
was
always
against
the
minister
right
or
and
fox
in
his
reply
had
overlooked
this
slip
of
the
tongue
tooke
immediately
seized
on
it
and
said
he
thought
it
at
least
an
equal
objection
to
sir
allan
that
he
was
always
the
minister
whether
right
or
wrong
this
retort
had
all
the
effect
and
produced
the
same
surprise
as
the
most
brilliant
display
of
wit
or
fancy
yet
it
was
only
the
detecting
a
flaw
in
an
argument
like
a
flaw
in
an
indictment
by
a
kind
of
legal
pertinacity
or
rather
by
a
rigid
and
constant
habit
of
attending
to
the
exact
import
of
every
word
and
clause
in
a
sentence
tooke
had
the
mind
of
a
lawyer
but
it
was
applied
to
a
vast
variety
of
topics
and
general
trains
of
speculation
horne
tooke
was
in
private
company
and
among
his
friends
the
finished
gentleman
of
the
last
age
his
manners
were
as
fascinating
as
his
conversation
was
spirited
and
delightful
he
put
one
in
mind
of
the
burden
of
the
song
of
king
old
courtier
and
an
old
courtier
of
the
he
was
however
of
the
opposite
party
it
was
curious
to
hear
our
modern
sciolist
advancing
opinions
of
the
most
radical
kind
without
any
mixture
of
radical
heat
or
violence
in
a
tone
of
fashionable
with
elegance
of
gesture
and
attitude
and
with
the
most
perfect
in
the
spirit
of
opposition
or
in
the
pride
of
logical
superiority
he
too
often
shocked
the
prejudices
or
wounded
the
of
those
about
him
while
he
himself
displayed
the
same
unmoved
indifference
or
equanimity
he
said
the
most
provoking
things
with
a
laughing
gaiety
and
a
polite
attention
that
there
was
no
withstanding
he
threw
others
off
their
guard
by
thwarting
their
favourite
theories
and
then
availed
himself
of
the
temperance
of
his
own
pulse
to
chafe
them
into
madness
he
had
not
one
particle
of
deference
for
the
opinion
of
others
nor
of
sympathy
with
their
feelings
nor
had
he
any
obstinate
convictions
of
his
own
to
defend
lord
of
himself
uncumbered
with
a
he
took
up
any
topic
by
chance
and
played
with
it
at
will
like
a
juggler
with
his
cups
and
balls
he
generally
ranged
himself
on
the
losing
side
and
had
rather
an
delight
in
contradiction
and
in
perplexing
the
understandings
of
others
without
leaving
them
any
clue
to
guide
them
out
of
the
labyrinth
into
which
he
had
led
them
he
understood
in
its
perfection
the
great
art
of
throwing
the
on
his
adversary
and
so
could
maintain
almost
any
opinion
however
absurd
or
fantastical
with
fearless
impunity
i
have
heard
a
sensible
and
man
say
that
he
never
was
in
company
with
tooke
without
being
delighted
and
surprised
or
without
feeling
the
conversation
of
every
other
person
to
be
flat
in
the
comparison
but
that
he
did
not
recollect
having
ever
heard
him
make
a
remark
that
struck
him
as
a
sound
and
true
one
or
that
he
himself
appeared
to
think
so
he
used
to
plague
fuseli
by
asking
him
after
the
origin
of
the
teutonic
dialects
and
parr
by
wishing
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
common
copulative
once
at
g
he
defended
pitt
from
a
charge
of
verbiage
and
endeavoured
to
prove
him
superior
to
fox
some
one
imitated
pitt
manner
to
show
that
it
was
monotonous
and
he
imitated
him
also
to
show
that
it
was
not
he
maintained
what
would
he
not
maintain
that
young
betty
acting
was
finer
than
john
kemble
and
recited
a
passage
from
douglas
in
the
manner
of
each
to
justify
the
preference
he
gave
to
the
former
the
mentioning
this
will
please
the
living
it
can
not
hurt
the
dead
he
argued
on
the
same
occasion
and
in
the
same
breath
that
addison
style
was
without
modulation
and
that
it
was
physically
impossible
for
any
one
to
write
well
who
was
habitually
silent
in
company
he
sat
like
a
king
at
his
own
table
and
gave
law
to
his
guests
and
to
the
world
no
man
knew
better
how
to
manage
his
immediate
circle
to
foil
or
bring
them
out
a
professed
orator
beginning
to
address
some
observations
to
tooke
with
a
voluminous
apology
for
his
youth
and
inexperience
he
said
speak
up
young
man
and
by
taking
him
at
his
word
cut
short
the
flower
of
orations
porson
was
the
only
person
of
whom
he
stood
in
some
degree
of
awe
on
account
of
his
prodigious
memory
and
knowledge
of
his
favourite
subject
languages
sheridan
it
has
been
remarked
said
more
good
things
but
had
not
an
equal
flow
of
pleasantry
as
an
instance
of
horne
tooke
extreme
coolness
and
command
of
nerve
it
has
been
mentioned
that
once
at
a
public
dinner
when
he
had
got
on
the
table
to
return
thanks
for
his
health
being
drank
with
a
glass
of
wine
in
his
hand
and
when
there
was
a
great
clamour
and
opposition
for
some
time
after
it
had
subsided
he
pointed
to
the
glass
to
shew
that
it
was
still
full
holcroft
the
author
of
the
to
was
one
of
the
most
violent
and
of
all
that
motley
crew
of
persons
who
attended
the
sunday
meetings
at
wimbledon
one
day
he
was
so
enraged
by
some
paradox
or
raillery
of
his
host
that
he
indignantly
rose
from
his
chair
and
said
tooke
you
are
a
scoundrel
his
opponent
without
manifesting
the
least
emotion
replied
holcroft
when
is
it
that
i
am
to
dine
with
you
shall
it
be
next
thursday
if
you
please
mr
tooke
answered
the
angry
philosopher
and
sat
down
it
was
delightful
to
see
him
sometimes
turn
from
these
waspish
or
ludicrous
altercations
with
antagonists
to
some
old
friend
and
veteran
politician
seated
at
his
elbow
to
hear
him
recal
the
time
of
wilkes
and
liberty
the
conversation
mellowing
like
the
wine
with
the
smack
of
age
assenting
to
all
the
old
man
said
bringing
out
his
pleasant
and
pampering
him
into
childish
and
sending
him
away
thirty
years
younger
than
he
came
as
a
public
or
at
least
as
a
parliamentary
speaker
tooke
did
not
answer
the
expectations
that
had
been
conceived
of
him
or
probably
that
he
had
conceived
of
himself
it
is
natural
for
men
who
have
felt
a
superiority
over
all
those
whom
they
happen
to
have
encountered
to
fancy
that
this
superiority
will
continue
and
that
it
will
extend
from
individuals
to
public
bodies
there
is
no
rule
in
the
case
or
rather
the
probability
lies
the
contrary
way
that
which
constitutes
the
excellence
of
conversation
is
of
little
use
in
addressing
large
assemblies
of
people
while
other
qualities
are
required
that
are
hardly
to
be
looked
for
in
one
and
the
same
capacity
the
way
to
move
great
masses
of
men
is
to
shew
that
you
yourself
are
moved
in
a
private
circle
a
ready
repartee
a
shrewd
ridicule
and
banter
a
caustic
remark
or
an
amusing
anecdote
whatever
sets
off
the
individual
to
advantage
or
gratifies
the
curiosity
or
piques
the
of
the
hearers
keeps
attention
alive
and
secures
the
triumph
of
the
speaker
it
is
a
personal
contest
and
depends
on
personal
and
momentary
advantages
but
in
appealing
to
the
public
no
one
triumphs
but
in
the
triumph
of
some
public
cause
or
by
shewing
a
sympathy
with
the
general
and
predominant
feelings
of
mankind
in
a
private
room
a
satirist
a
sophist
may
provoke
admiration
by
expressing
his
contempt
for
each
of
his
adversaries
in
turn
and
by
setting
their
opinion
at
defiance
but
when
men
are
congregated
together
on
a
great
public
question
and
for
a
weighty
object
they
must
be
treated
with
more
respect
they
are
touched
with
what
affects
themselves
or
the
general
weal
not
with
what
flatters
the
vanity
of
the
speaker
they
must
be
moved
altogether
if
they
are
moved
at
all
they
are
impressed
with
gratitude
for
a
luminous
exposition
of
their
claims
or
for
zeal
in
their
cause
and
the
lightning
of
generous
indignation
at
bad
men
and
bad
measures
is
followed
by
thunders
of
applause
even
in
the
house
of
commons
but
a
man
may
sneer
and
cavil
and
puzzle
and
every
question
that
comes
before
him
be
despised
and
feared
by
others
and
admired
by
no
one
but
himself
he
who
thinks
first
of
himself
either
in
the
world
or
in
a
popular
assembly
will
be
sure
to
turn
attention
away
from
his
claims
instead
of
fixing
it
there
he
must
make
common
cause
with
his
hearers
to
lead
he
must
follow
the
general
bias
tooke
did
not
therefore
succeed
as
a
speaker
in
parliament
he
stood
aloof
he
played
antics
he
exhibited
his
peculiar
talent
while
he
was
on
his
legs
the
question
before
the
house
stood
still
the
only
point
at
issue
respected
tooke
himself
his
personal
address
and
adroitness
of
intellect
were
there
to
be
no
more
places
and
pensions
because
tooke
style
was
terse
and
epigrammatic
were
the
opposition
benches
to
be
inflamed
to
an
unusual
pitch
of
sacred
vehemence
because
he
gave
them
plainly
to
understand
there
was
not
a
pin
to
choose
between
ministers
and
opposition
would
the
house
let
him
remain
among
them
because
if
they
turned
him
out
on
account
of
his
lord
camelford
had
threatened
to
send
his
in
his
place
this
was
a
good
joke
but
not
a
practical
one
would
he
gain
the
affections
of
the
people
out
of
doors
by
scouting
the
question
of
reform
would
the
king
ever
relish
the
old
associate
of
wilkes
what
interest
then
what
party
did
he
represent
he
represented
nobody
but
himself
he
was
an
example
of
an
ingenious
man
a
clever
talker
but
he
was
out
of
his
place
in
the
house
of
commons
where
people
did
not
come
as
in
his
own
house
to
admire
or
break
a
lance
with
him
but
to
get
through
the
business
of
the
day
and
so
adjourn
he
wanted
effect
and
each
of
his
sentences
told
very
well
in
itself
but
they
did
not
all
together
make
a
speech
he
left
off
where
he
began
his
eloquence
was
a
succession
of
drops
not
a
stream
his
arguments
though
subtle
and
new
did
not
affect
the
main
body
of
the
question
the
coldness
and
pettiness
of
his
manner
did
not
warm
the
hearts
or
expand
the
understandings
of
his
hearers
instead
of
encouraging
he
checked
the
ardour
of
his
friends
and
teazed
instead
of
overpowering
his
antagonists
the
only
palpable
hit
he
ever
made
while
he
remained
there
was
the
comparing
his
own
situation
in
being
rejected
by
the
house
on
account
of
the
supposed
purity
of
his
clerical
character
to
the
story
of
the
girl
at
the
magdalen
who
was
told
she
must
turn
out
and
qualify
a
this
met
with
laughter
and
loud
applause
it
was
a
thrust
and
the
house
to
do
them
justice
are
obliged
to
any
one
who
by
a
smart
blow
relieves
them
of
the
load
of
grave
responsibility
which
sits
heavy
on
their
at
the
hustings
or
as
an
tooke
did
better
there
was
no
great
question
to
move
or
carry
it
was
an
affair
of
political
between
himself
and
the
other
candidates
he
took
it
in
a
very
cool
and
leisurely
manner
watched
his
competitors
with
a
wary
sarcastic
eye
picked
up
the
mistakes
or
absurdities
that
fell
from
them
and
retorted
them
on
their
heads
told
a
story
to
the
mob
and
smiled
and
took
snuff
with
a
gentlemanly
and
becoming
air
as
if
he
was
already
seated
in
the
house
but
a
court
of
law
was
the
place
where
tooke
made
the
best
figure
in
public
he
might
assuredly
be
said
to
be
native
and
endued
unto
that
element
he
had
here
to
stand
merely
on
the
defensive
not
to
advance
himself
but
to
block
up
the
way
not
to
impress
others
but
to
be
himself
impenetrable
all
he
wanted
was
and
to
this
no
one
was
better
qualified
to
aspire
cross
purposes
pleas
demurrers
flaws
in
the
indictment
double
meanings
cases
inconsequentialities
these
were
the
the
darlings
of
tooke
mind
and
with
these
he
baffled
the
judge
the
counsel
and
outwitted
the
jury
the
report
of
his
trial
before
lord
kenyon
is
a
of
acuteness
dexterity
modest
assurance
and
legal
effect
it
is
much
like
his
examination
before
the
commissioners
of
the
nothing
could
be
got
out
of
him
in
either
case
tooke
as
a
political
leader
belonged
to
the
class
of
or
at
most
it
was
his
delight
to
make
mischief
and
spoil
sport
he
would
rather
be
himself
than
any
body
else
he
was
neither
a
bold
nor
a
safe
leader
he
enticed
others
into
scrapes
and
kept
out
of
them
himself
provided
he
could
say
a
clever
or
a
spiteful
thing
he
did
not
care
whether
it
served
or
injured
the
cause
spleen
or
the
exercise
of
intellectual
power
was
the
motive
of
his
patriotism
rather
than
principle
he
would
talk
treason
with
a
saving
clause
and
instil
sedition
into
the
public
mind
through
the
medium
of
a
third
who
was
to
be
the
responsible
party
he
made
sir
francis
burdett
his
spokesman
in
the
house
and
to
the
country
often
venting
his
chagrin
or
singularity
of
sentiment
at
the
expense
of
his
friend
but
what
in
the
first
was
trick
or
reckless
vanity
was
in
the
last
plain
downright
english
honesty
and
singleness
of
heart
in
the
case
of
the
state
trials
in
tooke
rather
compromised
his
friends
to
screen
himself
he
kept
repeating
that
others
might
have
gone
on
to
windsor
but
he
had
stopped
at
hounslow
as
if
to
go
farther
might
have
been
dangerous
and
unwarrantable
it
was
not
the
question
how
far
he
or
others
had
actually
gone
but
how
far
they
had
a
right
to
go
according
to
the
law
his
conduct
was
not
the
limit
of
the
law
nor
did
treasonable
excess
begin
where
prudence
or
principle
taught
him
to
stop
short
though
this
was
the
oblique
inference
liable
to
be
drawn
from
his
line
of
defence
tooke
was
uneasy
and
apprehensive
for
the
issue
of
the
while
in
confinement
and
said
in
speaking
of
it
to
a
friend
with
a
morbid
feeling
and
an
emphasis
quite
unusual
with
him
they
want
our
blood
blood
blood
it
was
somewhat
ridiculous
to
implicate
tooke
in
a
charge
of
high
treason
and
indeed
the
whole
charge
was
built
on
the
mistaken
purport
of
an
intercepted
letter
relating
to
an
engagement
for
a
private
dinnerparty
his
politics
were
not
at
all
revolutionary
in
this
respect
he
was
a
mere
pettifogger
full
of
chicane
and
captious
objections
and
unmeaning
discontent
but
he
had
none
of
the
grand
whirling
movements
of
the
french
revolution
nor
of
the
tumultuous
glow
of
rebellion
in
his
head
or
in
his
heart
his
politics
were
cast
in
a
different
mould
or
confined
to
the
party
distinctions
and
intrigues
and
pittances
of
popular
right
that
made
a
noise
in
the
time
of
junius
and
wilkes
and
even
if
his
understanding
had
gone
along
with
more
modern
and
unqualified
principles
his
cautious
temper
would
have
prevented
his
risking
them
in
practice
horne
tooke
though
not
of
the
same
side
in
politics
had
much
of
the
tone
of
mind
and
more
of
the
spirit
of
moral
feeling
of
the
celebrated
philosopher
of
malmesbury
the
narrow
scale
and
distinctions
of
his
political
creed
made
his
conversation
on
such
subjects
infinitely
amusing
particularly
when
contrasted
with
that
of
persons
who
dealt
in
the
sounding
and
sweeping
clauses
of
abstract
politics
he
knew
all
the
cabals
and
jealousies
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
late
reign
the
changes
of
administration
and
the
springs
of
secret
influence
the
characters
of
the
leading
men
wilkes
barrè
dunning
chatham
burke
the
marquis
of
rockingham
north
shelburne
fox
pitt
and
all
the
vacillating
events
of
the
american
war
these
formed
a
curious
to
the
more
prominent
figures
that
occupied
the
present
time
and
tooke
worked
out
the
minute
details
and
touched
in
the
evanescent
with
the
pencil
of
a
master
his
conversation
resembled
a
political
as
quaint
as
it
was
magical
to
some
pompous
pretenders
he
might
seem
to
narrate
old
wives
fables
but
not
to
those
who
study
human
nature
and
wish
to
know
the
materials
of
which
it
is
composed
tooke
faculties
might
appear
to
have
ripened
and
acquired
a
finer
flavour
with
age
in
a
former
period
of
his
life
he
was
hardly
the
man
he
was
latterly
or
else
he
had
greater
abilities
to
contend
against
he
no
where
makes
so
poor
a
figure
as
in
his
controversy
with
junius
he
has
evidently
the
best
of
the
argument
yet
he
makes
nothing
out
of
it
he
tells
a
long
story
about
himself
without
wit
or
point
in
it
and
whines
and
whimpers
like
a
under
the
rod
of
his
master
junius
after
bringing
a
hasty
charge
against
him
has
not
a
single
fact
to
adduce
in
support
of
it
but
keeps
his
ground
and
fairly
beats
his
adversary
out
of
the
field
by
the
mere
force
of
style
one
would
think
that
parson
horne
knew
who
junius
was
and
was
afraid
of
him
under
him
his
genius
is
quite
rebuked
with
the
best
cause
to
defend
he
comes
off
more
shabbily
from
the
contest
than
any
other
person
in
the
letters
except
sir
william
draper
who
is
the
very
hero
of
defeat
the
great
thing
which
horne
tooke
has
done
and
which
he
has
left
behind
him
to
posterity
is
his
work
on
grammar
oddly
enough
entitled
the
diversions
of
purley
many
people
have
taken
it
up
as
a
description
of
a
game
others
supposing
it
to
be
a
novel
it
is
in
truth
one
of
the
few
philosophical
works
on
grammar
that
were
ever
written
the
essence
of
it
and
indeed
almost
all
that
is
really
valuable
in
it
is
contained
in
his
to
published
about
the
year
tooke
work
is
truly
elementary
lowth
described
as
the
finest
specimen
of
analysis
since
the
days
of
aristotle
a
work
in
which
there
is
no
analysis
at
all
for
analysis
consists
in
reducing
things
to
their
principles
and
not
in
endless
details
and
subdivisions
harris
multiplies
distinctions
and
confounds
his
readers
tooke
clears
away
the
rubbish
of
technicalities
and
strikes
at
the
root
of
his
subject
in
accomplishing
his
arduous
task
he
was
perhaps
aided
not
more
by
the
strength
and
resources
of
his
mind
than
by
its
limits
and
defects
there
is
a
web
of
old
associations
wound
round
language
that
is
a
kind
of
veil
over
its
natural
features
and
custom
puts
on
the
mask
of
ignorance
but
this
veil
this
mask
the
author
of
diversions
of
threw
aside
and
penetrated
to
the
naked
truth
of
things
by
the
literal
unimaginative
nature
of
his
understanding
and
because
he
was
not
subject
to
prejudices
or
illusions
of
any
kind
words
may
be
said
to
bear
a
charmed
life
that
must
not
yield
to
one
of
woman
born
with
womanish
weaknesses
and
confused
apprehensions
but
this
charm
was
broken
in
the
case
of
tooke
whose
mind
was
the
reverse
of
effeminate
hard
unbending
concrete
physical
and
who
saw
language
stripped
of
the
clothing
of
habit
or
sentiment
or
the
disguises
of
doting
pedantry
naked
in
its
cradle
and
in
its
primitive
state
our
author
tells
us
that
he
found
his
discovery
on
grammar
among
a
number
of
papers
on
other
subjects
which
he
had
thrown
aside
and
forgotten
is
this
an
idle
boast
or
had
he
made
other
discoveries
of
equal
importance
which
he
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
communicate
to
the
world
but
chose
to
die
the
churl
of
knowledge
the
whole
of
his
reasoning
turns
upon
shewing
that
the
conjunction
is
the
pronoun
which
is
itself
the
participle
of
a
verb
and
in
like
manner
that
all
the
other
mystical
and
hitherto
unintelligible
parts
of
speech
are
derived
from
the
only
two
intelligible
ones
the
verb
and
noun
i
affirm
gold
is
yellow
that
is
i
affirm
fact
or
that
proposition
viz
gold
is
yellow
the
secret
of
the
conjunction
on
which
so
many
fine
heads
had
split
on
which
so
many
learned
definitions
were
thrown
away
as
if
it
was
its
peculiar
province
and
inborn
virtue
to
announce
oracles
and
formal
propositions
and
nothing
else
like
a
doctor
of
laws
is
here
at
once
accounted
for
inasmuch
as
it
is
clearly
nothing
but
another
part
of
speech
the
pronoun
with
a
third
part
of
speech
the
noun
understood
this
is
getting
at
a
solution
of
words
into
their
component
parts
not
glossing
over
one
difficulty
by
bringing
another
to
parallel
it
nor
like
saying
with
harris
when
it
is
asked
what
a
conjunction
is
that
there
are
conjunctions
copulative
conjunctions
disjunctive
and
as
many
other
frivolous
varieties
of
the
species
as
any
one
chooses
to
hunt
out
with
laborious
foolery
our
author
hit
upon
his
in
the
course
of
a
while
he
was
examining
with
jealous
watchfulness
the
meaning
of
words
to
prevent
being
entrapped
by
them
or
rather
this
circumstance
might
itself
be
traced
to
the
habit
of
satisfying
his
own
mind
as
to
the
precise
sense
in
which
he
himself
made
use
of
words
tooke
though
he
had
no
objection
to
puzzle
others
was
mightily
averse
to
being
puzzled
or
himself
all
was
to
his
determined
mind
either
complete
light
or
complete
darkness
there
was
no
hazy
doubtful
in
his
understanding
he
wanted
something
palpable
to
feeling
as
to
sight
what
he
would
say
to
himself
do
i
mean
when
i
use
the
conjunction
is
it
an
anomaly
a
class
by
itself
a
word
sealed
against
all
inquisitive
attempts
is
it
enough
to
call
it
a
a
bridge
a
link
a
word
connecting
sentences
that
is
undoubtedly
its
use
but
what
is
its
origin
tooke
thought
he
had
answered
this
question
satisfactorily
and
loosened
the
gordian
knot
of
grammarians
familiar
as
his
garter
when
he
said
it
is
the
common
pronoun
adjective
or
participle
with
the
noun
or
implied
and
the
particular
example
following
it
so
he
thought
and
so
every
reader
has
thought
since
with
the
exception
of
teachers
and
writers
upon
grammar
windham
indeed
who
was
a
sophist
but
not
a
logician
charged
him
with
having
found
a
but
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
tooke
etymologies
will
stand
the
test
and
last
longer
than
windham
ingenious
derivation
of
the
practice
of
from
the
principles
of
humanity
having
thus
laid
the
he
proceeded
to
apply
the
same
method
of
reasoning
to
other
undecyphered
and
impracticable
terms
thus
the
word
he
explained
clearly
enough
to
be
the
verb
or
a
corruption
of
the
old
saxon
two
two
make
four
that
is
two
two
make
four
tooke
in
fact
treated
words
as
the
chemists
do
substances
he
separated
those
which
are
compounded
of
others
from
those
which
are
not
decompoundable
he
did
not
explain
the
obscure
by
the
more
obscure
but
the
difficult
by
the
plain
the
complex
by
the
simple
this
alone
is
proceeding
upon
the
true
principles
of
science
the
rest
is
pedantry
and
our
philosophical
writer
distinguished
all
words
into
of
and
directions
added
for
joining
them
together
or
originally
into
and
it
is
a
pity
that
he
has
left
this
matter
short
by
omitting
to
define
the
verb
after
enumerating
sixteen
different
definitions
all
of
which
he
dismisses
with
scorn
and
contumely
at
the
end
of
two
quarto
volumes
he
refers
the
reader
for
the
true
solution
to
a
third
volume
which
he
did
not
live
to
finish
this
extraordinary
man
was
in
the
habit
of
tantalizing
his
guests
on
a
sunday
afternoon
with
sundry
abstruse
speculations
and
putting
them
off
to
the
following
week
for
a
satisfaction
of
their
doubts
but
why
should
he
treat
posterity
in
the
same
scurvy
manner
or
leave
the
world
without
quitting
scores
with
it
i
question
whether
tooke
was
himself
in
possession
of
his
pretended
and
whether
after
trying
hard
at
a
definition
of
the
verb
as
a
distinct
part
of
speech
as
a
mumbles
a
he
did
not
find
it
too
much
for
him
and
leave
it
to
its
fate
it
is
also
a
pity
that
tooke
spun
out
his
great
work
with
prolix
and
dogmatical
dissertations
on
irrelevant
matters
and
after
denying
the
old
metaphysical
theories
of
language
should
attempt
to
found
a
metaphysical
theory
of
his
own
on
the
nature
and
mechanism
of
language
the
nature
of
words
he
contended
it
was
the
basis
of
his
whole
system
had
no
connection
with
the
nature
of
things
or
the
objects
of
thought
yet
he
afterwards
strove
to
limit
the
nature
of
things
and
of
the
human
mind
by
the

thus
he
endeavours
to
shew
that
there
are
no
abstract
ideas
by
enumerating
two
thousand
instances
of
words
expressing
abstract
ideas
that
are
the
past
participles
of
certain
verbs
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
he
means
by
this
on
the
other
hand
he
maintains
that
a
complex
idea
is
as
great
an
absurdity
as
a
complex
star
and
that
words
only
are
complex
he
also
makes
out
a
triumphant
list
of
metaphysical
and
moral
proved
to
be
so
on
the
pure
principle
that
the
names
of
these
are
participles
not
nouns
or
names
of
things
that
is
strange
in
so
close
a
reasoner
and
in
one
who
maintained
that
all
language
was
a
masquerade
of
words
and
that
the
class
to
which
they
grammatically
belonged
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
class
of
ideas
they
represented
it
is
now
above
twenty
years
since
the
two
quarto
volumes
of

published
and
fifty
since
the

it
is

of

of

helps

to

proceeded

complete
defiance
of
all
the

there
laid
down
he
defines
a

there
are
six
cases
in

that
is
six

without
any

of

at
all
and
that
english

have
all
the

that
the

have

is
an
extraordinary

of

he
very
formally
translates
the

into

so

had
done
before
him

he
has
written

carry

it

with

there
nothing
beyond

it
seems
in

as
in

many
other

this

its

in

is
that
he
confounds
the

making

periphrastic

sir
walter
scott
is
undoubtedly
the
most
popular
writer
of
the
age
the
lord
of
the
ascendant
for
the
time
being
he
is
just
half
what
the
human
intellect
is
capable
of
being
if
you
take
the
universe
and
divide
it
into
two
parts
he
knows
all
that
it
all
that
it
to
is
nothing
to
him
his
is
a
mind
brooding
over
antiquity
scorning
the
present
ignorant
time
he
is
laudator
temporis
acti
a
of
things
past
the
old
world
is
to
him
a
crowded
map
the
new
one
a
dull
hateful
blank
he
dotes
on
all
authenticated
superstitions
he
shudders
at
the
shadow
of
innovation
his
retentiveness
of
memory
his
accumulated
weight
of
interested
prejudice
or
romantic
association
have
overlaid
his
other
faculties
the
cells
of
his
memory
are
vast
various
full
even
to
bursting
with
life
and
motion
his
speculative
understanding
is
empty
flaccid
poor
and
dead
his
mind
receives
and
treasures
up
every
thing
brought
to
it
by
tradition
or
custom
it
does
not
project
itself
beyond
this
into
the
world
unknown
but
mechanically
shrinks
back
as
from
the
edge
of
a
prejudice
the
land
of
pure
reason
is
to
his
apprehension
like
dieman
barren
miserable
distant
a
place
of
exile
the
dreary
abode
of

and
adventurers
sir
walter
would
make
a
bad
hand
of
a
description
of
the
unless
he
could
lay
the
scene
in
scotland
five
hundred
years
ago
and
then
he
would
want
facts
and
parchments
to
support
his
drooping
style
our
historical
novelist
firmly
thinks
that
nothing
but
what
that
the
moral
world
stands
still
as
the
material
one
was
supposed
to
do
of
old
and
that
we
can
never
get
beyond
the
point
where
we
actually
are
without
utter
destruction
though
every
thing
changes
and
will
change
from
what
it
was
three
hundred
years
ago
to
what
it
is
now
from
what
it
is
now
to
all
that
the
bigoted
admirer
of
the
good
old
times
most
dreads
and
hates
it
is
long
since
we
read
and
long
since
we
thought
of
our
poetry
it
would
probably
have
gone
out
of
date
with
the
immediate
occasion
even
if
he
himself
had
not
contrived
to
banish
it
from
our
recollection
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
it
had
great
merit
both
of
an
obvious
and
intrinsic
kind
it
abounded
in
vivid
descriptions
in
spirited
action
in
smooth
and
flowing
versification
but
it
wanted
it
was
poetry
of
no
mark
or
likelihood
it
slid
out
of
the
mind
as
soon
as
read
like
a
river
and
would
have
been
forgotten
but
that
the
public
curiosity
was
fed
with
supplies
from
the
same
teeming
liquid
source
it
is
not
every
man
that
can
write
six
quarto
volumes
in
verse
that
are
caught
up
with
avidity
even
by
fastidious
judges
but
what
a
difference
between
popularity
and
that
of
the
scotch
novels
it
is
true
the
public
read
and
admired
the
of
the
last
minstrel
and
so
on
and
each
individual
was
contented
to
read
and
admire
because
the
public
did
so
but
with
regard
to
the
of
the
same
supposed
author
it
is
quite
sort
of
thing
here
every
one
stands
forward
to
applaud
on
his
own
ground
would
be
thought
to
go
before
the
public
opinion
is
eager
to
extol
his
favourite
characters
louder
to
understand
them
better
than
every
body
else
and
has
his
own
scale
of
comparative
excellence
for
each
work
supported
by
nothing
but
his
own
enthusiastic
and
fearless
convictions
it
must
be
amusing
to
the
of
to
hear
his
readers
and
admirers
and
are
not
these
the
same
thing
a
quarrelling
which
of
his
novels
is
the
best
opposing
character
to
character
quoting
passage
against
passage
striving
to
surpass
each
other
in
the
extravagance
of
their
encomiums
and
yet
unable
to
settle
the
precedence
or
to
do
the
author
writings
justice
so
various
so
equal
so
transcendant
are
their
merits
his
volumes
of
poetry
were
received
as
fashionable
and
acquaintances
we
are
ready
to
tear
the
others
in
pieces
as
old
friends
there
was
something
meretricious
in
sir
walter
and
like
those
who
keep
opera
we
were
willing
to
have
our
admiration
shared
and
our
taste
confirmed
by
the
town
but
the
novels
are
like
the
betrothed
of
our
hearts
bone
of
our
bone
and
flesh
of
our
flesh
and
we
are
jealous
that
any
one
should
be
as
much
delighted
or
as
thoroughly
acquainted
with
their
beauties
as
ourselves
for
which
of
his
poetical
heroines
would
the
reader
break
a
lance
so
soon
as
for
jeanie
deans
what
of
the
can
compare
with
the
beautiful
rebecca
we
believe
the
late
john
scott
went
to
his
though
a
painful
and
premature
one
with
some
degree
of
satisfaction
inasmuch
as
he
had
penned
the
most
elaborate
panegyric
on
the
that
had
as
yet
appeared
the
are
not
poems
so
much
as
metrical
romances
there
is
a
glittering
veil
of
verse
thrown
over
the
features
of
nature
and
of
old
romance
the
deep
incisions
into
character
are
skinned
and
filmed
over
the
details
are
lost
or
shaped
into
flimsy
and
insipid
decorum
and
the
truth
of
feeling
and
of
circumstance
is
translated
into
a
tinkling
sound
a
tinsel
it
must
be
owned
there
is
a
power
in
true
poetry
that
lifts
the
mind
from
the
ground
of
reality
to
a
higher
sphere
that
penetrates
the
inert
scattered
incoherent
materials
presented
to
it
and
by
a
force
and
inspiration
of
its
own
melts
and
moulds
them
into
sublimity
and
beauty
but
sir
walter
we
contend
under
correction
has
not
this
creative
impulse
this
plastic
power
this
capacity
of
reacting
on
his
first
impressions
he
is
a
learned
a
literal
a
expounder
of
truth
or
fable
b
he
does
not
soar
above
and
look
down
upon
his
subject
imparting
his
own
lofty
views
and
feelings
to
his
descriptions
of
nature
he
relies
upon
it
is
raised
by
it
is
one
with
it
or
he
is
nothing
a
poet
is
essentially
a
that
is
he
must
atone
for
what
he
loses
in
individuality
and
local
resemblance
by
the
energies
and
resources
of
his
own
mind
the
writer
of
whom
we
speak
is
deficient
in
these
last
he
has
either
not
the
faculty
or
not
the
will
to
impregnate
his
subject
by
an
effort
of
pure
invention
the
execution
also
is
much
upon
a
par
with
the
more
ephemeral
effusions
of
the
press
it
is
light
agreeable
effeminate
diffuse
sir
walter
muse
is
a
the
smooth
glossy
texture
of
his
verse
contrasts
happily
with
the
quaint
uncouth
rugged
materials
of
which
it
is
composed
and
takes
away
any
appearance
of
heaviness
or
harshness
from
the
body
of
local
traditions
and
obsolete
costume
we
see
grim
knights
and
iron
armour
but
then
they
are
woven
in
silk
with
a
careless
delicate
hand
and
have
the
softness
of
flowers
the
poet
figures
might
be
compared
to
old
c
tapestries
copied
on
the
finest
velvet
they
are
not
like
raphael
but
they
are
very
like
westall
drawings
which
accompany
and
are
intended
to
illustrate
them
this
facility
and
grace
of
execution
is
the
more
remarkable
as
a
story
goes
that
not
long
before
the
appearance
of
the
of
the
last
sir
walter
then
scott
having
in
the
company
of
a
friend
to
cross
the
frith
of
forth
in
a
they
proposed
to
beguile
the
time
by
writing
a
number
of
verses
on
a
given
subject
and
that
at
the
end
of
an
hour
hard
study
they
found
they
had
produced
only
six
lines
between
them
it
is
plain
said
the
unconscious
author
to
his
that
you
and
i
need
never
think
of
getting
our
living
by
writing
poetry
in
a
year
or
so
after
this
he
set
to
work
and
poured
out
quarto
upon
quarto
as
if
they
had
been
drops
of
water
as
to
the
rest
and
compared
with
true
and
great
poets
our
scottish
minstrel
is
but
a
metre
we
would
rather
have
written
one
song
of
burns
or
a
single
passage
in
lord
byron
and
or
one
of
wordsworth
fancies
and
than
all
his
epics
what
is
he
to
spenser
over
whose
immortal
verse
beauty
hovers
and
trembles
and
who
has
shed
the
purple
light
of
fancy
from
his
ambrosial
wings
over
all
nature
what
is
there
of
the
might
of
milton
whose
head
is
canopied
in
the
blue
serene
and
who
takes
us
to
sit
with
him
there
what
is
there
in
his
ambling
rhymes
of
the
deep
pathos
of
chaucer
or
of
the
power
of
shakespear
whose
eye
watching
alike
the
minutest
traces
of
characters
and
the
strongest
movements
of
passion
glances
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
and
with
the
lambent
flame
of
genius
playing
round
each
object
lights
up
the
universe
in
a
robe
of
its
own
radiance
sir
walter
has
no
voluntary
power
of
combination
all
his
associations
as
we
said
before
are
those
of
habit
or
of
tradition
he
is
a
mere
narrative
and
descriptive
poet
garrulous
of
the
old
time
the
definition
of
his
poetry
is
a
pleasing
superficiality
not
so
of
his
novels
and
romances
there
we
turn
over
a
new
leaf
another
and
the
same
the
same
in
matter
but
in
form
in
power
how
different
the
author
of
waverley
has
got
rid
of
the
tagging
of
rhymes
the
eking
out
of
syllables
the
supplying
of
epithets
the
colours
of
style
the
grouping
of
his
characters
and
the
regular
march
of
events
and
comes
to
the
point
at
once
and
strikes
at
the
heart
of
his
subject
without
dismay
and
without
disguise
his
poetry
was
a
lady
dressed
out
in
finery
his
prose
is
a
beautiful
rustic
nymph
that
like
dorothea
in
don
quixote
when
she
is
surprised
with
dishevelled
tresses
bathing
her
naked
feet
in
the
brook
looks
round
her
abashed
at
the
admiration
her
charms
have
excited
the
grand
secret
of
the
author
success
in
these
latter
productions
is
that
he
has
completely
got
rid
of
the
trammels
of
authorship
and
torn
off
at
one
rent
as
lord
peter
got
rid
of
so
many
yards
of
lace
in
the
of
a
all
the
ornaments
of
fine
writing
and
sentimentality
all
is
fresh
as
from
the
hand
of
nature
by
going
a
century
or
two
back
and
laying
the
scene
in
a
remote
and
uncultivated
district
all
becomes
new
and
startling
in
the
present
advanced
highland
manners
characters
scenery
superstitions
northern
dialect
and
costume
the
wars
the
religion
and
politics
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
give
a
charming
and
wholesome
relief
to
the
fastidious
refinement
and
lassitude
of
modern
readers
like
the
effect
of
plunging
a
nervous
valetudinarian
into
a
the
for
this
reason
are
not
so
much
admired
in
scotland
as
in
england
the
contrast
the
transition
is
less
striking
from
the
top
of
the
the
inhabitants
of
auld
reekie
can
descry
or
fancy
they
descry
the
peaks
of
ben
lomond
and
the
waving
outline
of
rob
roy
country
we
who
live
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
island
can
only
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
billowy
scene
in
the
descriptions
of
the
author
of
waverley
the
mountain
air
is
most
bracing
to
our
languid
nerves
and
it
is
brought
us
in
from
the
neighbourhood
of
there
is
another
circumstance
to
be
taken
into
the
account
in
edinburgh
there
is
a
little
opposition
and
something
of
the
spirit
of
cabal
between
the
partisans
of
works
proceeding
from
constable
and
blackwood
shops
constable
gives
the
highest
prices
but
being
the
whig
bookseller
it
is
grudged
that
he
should
do
so
an
attempt
is
therefore
made
to
transfer
a
certain
share
of
popularity
to
the
scotch
novels
the
embryo
fry
the
little
airy
of
children
issuing
through
blackwood
this
operates
a
diversion
which
does
not
affect
us
here
the
author
of
waverley
wears
the
palm
of
legendary
lore
alone
sir
walter
may
indeed
surfeit
us
his
imitators
make
us
sick
it
may
be
asked
it
has
been
asked
have
we
no
materials
for
romance
in
england
must
we
look
to
scotland
for
a
supply
of
whatever
is
original
and
striking
in
this
kind
and
we
answer
yes
every
foot
of
soil
is
with
us
worked
up
nearly
every
movement
of
the
social
machine
is
calculable
we
have
no
room
left
for
violent
catastrophes
for
grotesque
quaintnesses
for
wizard
spells
the
last
skirts
of
ignorance
and
barbarism
are
seen
hovering
in
sir
walter
pages
over
the
border
we
have
it
is
true
gipsies
in
this
country
as
well
as
at
the
cairn
of
derncleugh
but
they
live
under
clipped
hedges
and
repose
in
and
do
not
perch
on
crags
like
eagles
or
take
shelter
like
in
basaltic
subterranean
caverns
we
have
heaths
with
rude
heaps
of
stones
upon
them
but
no
existing
superstition
converts
them
into
the
geese
of
or
sees
a
black
dwarf
groping
among
them
we
have
sects
in
religion
but
the
only
thing
sublime
or
ridiculous
in
that
way
is
irving
the
caledonian
preacher
who
comes
like
a
satyr
staring
from
the
woods
and
yet
speaks
like
an
orator
we
had
a
parson
adams
not
quite
a
hundred
years
ago
a
sir
roger
de
coverley
rather
more
than
a
hundred
even
sir
walter
is
ordinarily
obliged
to
pitch
his
angle
strong
as
the
hook
is
a
hundred
miles
to
the
north
of
the
modern
athens
or
a
century
back
his
last
work
a
indeed
is
mystical
is
romantic
in
nothing
but
the
instead
of
a
sprinkle
dipped
in
dew
he
has
given
us
a
fashionable
and
we
see
what
he
has
made
of
it
he
must
not
come
down
from
his
fastnesses
in
traditional
barbarism
and
native
rusticity
the
level
the
littleness
the
frippery
of
modern
civilization
will
undo
him
as
it
has
undone
us
sir
walter
has
found
out
oh
rare
discovery
that
facts
are
better
than
fiction
that
there
is
no
romance
like
the
romance
of
real
life
and
that
if
we
can
but
arrive
at
what
men
feel
do
and
say
in
striking
and
singular
situations
the
result
will
be
more
lively
audible
and
full
of
vent
than
the
cobwebs
of
the
brain
with
reverence
be
it
spoken
he
is
like
the
man
who
having
to
imitate
the
squeaking
of
a
pig
upon
the
stage
brought
the
animal
under
his
coat
with
him
our
author
has
conjured
up
the
actual
people
he
has
to
deal
with
or
as
much
as
he
could
get
of
them
in
their
habits
as
they
lived
he
has
ransacked
old
chronicles
and
poured
the
contents
upon
his
page
he
has
squeezed
out
musty
records
he
has
consulted
wayfaring
pilgrims
sibyls
he
has
invoked
the
spirits
of
the
air
he
has
conversed
with
the
living
and
the
dead
and
let
them
tell
their
story
their
own
way
and
by
borrowing
of
others
has
enriched
his
own
genius
with
everlasting
variety
truth
and
freedom
he
has
taken
his
materials
from
the
original
authentic
sources
in
large
concrete
masses
and
not
tampered
with
or
too
much
frittered
them
away
he
is
only
the
amanuensis
of
truth
and
history
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
fine
his
writings
in
consequence
are
unless
we
could
describe
how
fine
nature
is
all
that
portion
of
the
history
of
his
country
that
he
has
touched
upon
wide
as
the
scope
is
the
manners
the
personages
the
events
the
scenery
lives
over
again
in
his
volumes
nothing
is
wanting
the
illusion
is
complete
there
is
a
hurtling
in
the
air
a
trampling
of
feet
upon
the
ground
as
these
perfect
representations
of
human
character
or
fanciful
belief
come
thronging
back
upon
our
imaginations
we
will
merely
recall
a
few
of
the
subjects
of
his
pencil
to
the
reader
recollection
for
nothing
we
could
add
by
way
of
note
or
commendation
could
make
the
impression
more
vivid
there
is
first
and
foremost
because
the

the
fine
old

what
a
list
of
names
what
a
host
of
associations
what
a
thing
is
human
life
what
a
power
is
that
of
genius
what
a
world
of
thought
and
feeling
is
thus
rescued
from
oblivion
how
many
hours
of
heartfelt
satisfaction
has
our
author
given
to
the
gay
and
thoughtless
how
many
sad
hearts
has
he
soothed
in
pain
and
solitude
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
public
repay
with
lengthened
applause
and
gratitude
the
pleasure
they
receive
he
writes
as
fast
as
they
can
read
and
he
does
not
write
himself
down
he
is
always
in
the
public
eye
and
we
do
not
tire
of
him
his
worst
is
better
than
any
other
person
best
his
and
his
later
works
are
little
else
but
capitally
made
out
are
more
attractive
than
the
principal
figures
and
most
complicated
actions
of
other
writers
his
works
taken
together
are
almost
like
a
new
edition
of
human
nature
this
is
indeed
to
be
an
author
the
political
bearing
of
the
has
been
a
considerable
recommendation
to
them
they
are
a
relief
to
the
mind
rarefied
as
it
has
been
with
modern
philosophy
and
heated
with
at
a
time
also
when
we
bid
fair
to
revive
the
principles
of
the
stuarts
it
is
interesting
to
bring
us
acquainted
with
their
persons
and
misfortunes
the
candour
of
sir
walter
historic
pen
levels
our
bristling
prejudices
on
this
score
and
sees
fair
play
between
roundheads
and
cavaliers
between
protestant
and
papist
he
is
a
writer
reconciling
all
the
diversities
of
human
nature
to
the
reader
he
does
not
enter
into
the
distinctions
of
hostile
sects
or
parties
but
treats
of
the
strength
or
the
infirmity
of
the
human
mind
of
the
virtues
or
vices
of
the
human
breast
as
they
are
to
be
found
blended
in
the
whole
race
of
mankind
nothing
can
shew
more
handsomely
or
be
more
gallantly
executed
there
was
a
talk
at
one
time
that
our
author
was
about
to
take
guy
faux
for
the
subject
of
one
of
his
novels
in
order
to
put
a
more
liberal
and
humane
construction
on
the
gunpowder
plot
than
our
no
popery
prejudices
have
hitherto
permitted
sir
walter
is
a
professed
of
the
age
from
the
vulgar
and
still
lurking
antipathy
to
popery
and
slavery
through
some
odd
process
of
logic
it
should
seem
that
in
restoring
the
claims
of
the
stuarts
by
the
courtesy
of
romance
the
house
of
brunswick
are
more
firmly
seated
in
point
of
fact
and
the
bourbons
by
collateral
reasoning
become
legitimate
in
any
other
point
of
view
we
can
not
possibly
conceive
how
sir
walter
imagines
he
has
done
something
to
revive
the
declining
spirit
of
loyalty
by
these
novels
his
loyalty
is
founded
on
treason
he
props
the
actual
throne
by
the
shadow
of
rebellion
does
he
really
think
of
making
us
enamoured
of
the
good
old
times
by
the
faithful
and
harrowing
portraits
he
has
drawn
of
them
would
he
carry
us
back
to
the
early
stages
of
barbarism
of
clanship
of
the
feudal
system
as
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
is
he
infatuated
enough
or
does
he
so
dote
and
drivel
over
his
own
slothful
and
prejudices
as
to
believe
that
he
will
make
a
single
convert
to
the
beauty
of
legitimacy
that
is
of
lawless
power
and
savage
bigotry
when
he
himself
is
obliged
to
apologise
for
the
horrors
he
describes
and
even
render
his
descriptions
credible
to
the
modern
reader
by
referring
to
the
authentic
history
of
these
delectable
times
e
he
is
indeed
so
besotted
as
to
the
moral
of
his
own
story
that
he
has
even
the
blindness
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
have
a
fling
at
and
the
contemptible
ingredients
as
he
would
have
us
believe
of
a
modern
rabble
at
the
very
time
when
he
is
describing
a
mob
of
the
twelfth
century
a
mob
one
should
think
after
the
writer
own
heart
without
one
particle
of
modern
philosophy
or
revolutionary
politics
in
their
composition
who
were
to
a
man
to
a
hair
just
what
priests
and
kings
and
nobles
them
be
and
who
were
collected
to
witness
a
spectacle
proper
to
the
times
the
burning
of
the
lovely
rebecca
at
a
stake
for
a
sorceress
because
she
was
a
jewess
beautiful
and
innocent
and
the
consequent
victim
of
insane
bigotry
and
unbridled
profligacy
and
it
is
at
this
moment
when
the
heart
is
kindled
and
bursting
with
indignation
at
the
revolting
abuses
of
power
that
sir
walter
the
to
have
a
sneer
at
the
people
and
to
put
a
spoke
as
he
thinks
in
the
wheel
of
upstart
innovation
this
is
what
he
calls
backing
his
friends
it
is
thus
he
administers
charms
and
philtres
to
our
love
of
legitimacy
makes
us
conceive
a
horror
of
all
reform
civil
political
or
religious
and
would
fain
put
down
the
of
the
the
author
of
waverley
might
just
as
well
get
up
and
make
a
speech
at
a
dinner
at
edinburgh
abusing
for
his
improvements
in
the
roads
on
the
ground
that
they
were
nearly
in
many
places
sixty
years
since
or
object
to
peel
by
insisting
that
was
formerly
a
scene
of
greater
interest
and
terror
to
highwaymen
and
travellers
and
cut
a
greater
figure
in
the
than
it
does
at
oh
wickliff
luther
hampden
sidney
somers
mistaken
whigs
and
thoughtless
reformers
in
religion
and
politics
and
all
ye
whether
poets
or
philosophers
heroes
or
sages
inventors
of
arts
or
sciences
patriots
benefactors
of
the
human
race
enlighteners
and
civilisers
of
the
world
who
have
so
far
reduced
opinion
to
reason
and
power
to
law
who
are
the
cause
that
we
no
longer
burn
witches
and
heretics
at
slow
fires
that
the
are
no
longer
applied
by
ghastly
smiling
judges
to
extort
confession
of
imputed
crimes
from
sufferers
for
conscience
sake
that
men
are
no
longer
strung
up
like
acorns
on
trees
without
judge
or
jury
or
hunted
like
wild
beasts
through
thickets
and
glens
who
have
abated
the
cruelty
of
priests
the
pride
of
nobles
the
divinity
of
kings
in
former
times
to
whom
we
owe
it
that
we
no
longer
wear
round
our
necks
the
collar
of
gurth
the
swineherd
and
of
wamba
the
jester
that
the
castles
of
great
lords
are
no
longer
the
dens
of
banditti
from
whence
they
issue
with
fire
and
sword
to
lay
waste
the
land
that
we
no
longer
expire
in
loathsome
dungeons
without
knowing
the
cause
or
have
our
right
hands
struck
off
for
raising
them
in
against
wanton
insult
that
we
can
sleep
without
fear
of
being
burnt
in
our
beds
or
travel
without
making
our
wills
that
no
amy
robsarts
are
thrown
down
by
richard
varneys
with
impunity
that
no
red
reiver
of
sets
fire
to
peaceful
cottages
that
no
claverhouse
signs
in
sport
that
we
have
no
tristan
the
hermit
or
andrè
crawling
near
us
like
spiders
and
making
our
flesh
creep
and
our
hearts
sicken
within
us
at
every
moment
of
our
lives
ye
who
have
produced
this
change
in
the
face
of
nature
and
society
return
to
earth
once
more
and
beg
pardon
of
sir
walter
and
his
patrons
who
sigh
at
not
being
able
to
undo
all
that
you
have
done
leaving
this
question
there
are
two
other
remarks
which
we
wished
to
make
on
the
novels
the
one
was
to
express
our
admiration
at
the
of
the
mottos
in
which
the
author
has
taken
occasion
to
remember
and
quote
almost
every
living
author
whether
illustrious
or
obscure
but
himself
an
indirect
argument
in
favour
of
the
general
opinion
as
to
the
source
from
which
they
spring
and
the
other
was
to
hint
our
astonishment
at
the
innumerable
and
incessant
of
bad
and
slovenly
english
in
them
more
we
believe
than
in
any
other
works
now
printed
we
should
think
the
writer
could
not
possibly
read
the
manuscript
after
he
has
once
written
it
or
overlook
the
press
if
there
were
a
writer
who
born
for
the
universe
his
mind
and
to
party
gave
up
what
was
meant
for
mankind
who
from
the
height
of
his
genius
looking
abroad
into
nature
and
scanning
the
recesses
of
the
human
heart
winked
and
shut
his
apprehension
up
to
every
thought
or
purpose
that
tended
to
the
future
good
of
mankind
who
raised
by
affluence
the
reward
of
successful
industry
and
by
the
voice
of
fame
above
the
want
of
any
but
the
most
honourable
patronage
stooped
to
the
unworthy
arts
of
adulation
and
abetted
the
views
of
the
great
with
the
pettifogging
feelings
of
the
meanest
dependant
on
office
who
having
secured
the
admiration
of
the
public
with
the
probable
reversion
of
immortality
shewed
no
respect
for
himself
for
that
genius
that
had
raised
him
to
distinction
for
that
nature
which
he
trampled
under
foot
who
amiable
frank
friendly
manly
in
private
life
was
seized
with
the
dotage
of
age
and
the
fury
of
a
woman
the
instant
politics
were
concerned
who
reserved
all
his
candour
and
comprehensiveness
of
view
for
history
and
vented
his
littleness
pique
resentment
bigotry
and
intolerance
on
his
contemporaries
who
took
the
wrong
side
and
defended
it
by
unfair
means
who
the
moment
his
own
interest
or
the
prejudices
of
others
interfered
seemed
to
forget
all
that
was
due
to
the
pride
of
intellect
to
the
sense
of
manhood
who
praised
admired
by
men
of
all
parties
alike
repaid
the
public
liberality
by
striking
a
secret
and
envenomed
blow
at
the
reputation
of
every
one
who
was
not
the
ready
tool
of
power
who
strewed
the

and
here
we
can
not
but
think
it
necessary
to
offer
some
better
proof
than
the
incidents
of
an
idle
tale
to
vindicate
the
melancholy
representation
of
manners
which
has
been
just
laid
before
the
reader
it
is
grievous
to
think
that
those
valiant
barons
to
whose
stand
against
the
crown
the
liberties
of
england
were
indebted
for
their
existence
should
themselves
have
been
such
dreadful
oppressors
and
capable
of
excesses
contrary
not
only
to
the
laws
of
england
but
to
those
of
nature
and
humanity
but
alas
we
have
only
to
extract
from
the
industrious
henry
one
of
those
numerous
passages
which
he
has
collected
from
contemporary
historians
to
prove
that
fiction
itself
can
hardly
reach
the
dark
reality
of
the
horrors
of
the
period
the
description
given
by
the
author
of
the
saxon
chronicle
of
the
cruelties
exercised
in
the
reign
of
king
stephen
by
the
great
barons
and
lords
of
castles
who
were
all
normans
affords
a
strong
proof
of
the
excesses
of
which
they
were
capable
when
their
passions
were
inflamed
grievously
oppressed
the
poor
people
by
building
castles
and
when
they
were
built
they
filled
them
with
wicked
men
or
rather
devils
who
seized
both
men
and
women
who
they
imagined
had
any
money
threw
them
into
prison
and
put
them
to
more
cruel
tortures
than
the
martyrs
ever
endured
they
suffocated
some
in
mud
and
suspended
others
by
the
feet
or
the
head
or
the
thumbs
kindling
fires
below
them
they
squeezed
the
heads
of
some
with
knotted
cords
till
they
pierced
their
brains
while
they
threw
others
into
dungeons
swarming
with
serpents

lord

lord
byron
and
sir
walter
scott
are
among
writers
now
living
a
the
two
who
would
carry
away
a
majority
of
suffrages
as
the
greatest
geniuses
of
the
age
the
former
would
perhaps
obtain
the
preference
with
the
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
squeamishness
apart
the
latter
with
the
critics
and
the
vulgar
we
shall
treat
of
them
in
the
same
connection
partly
on
account
of
their
distinguished
and
partly
because
they
afford
a
complete
contrast
to
each
other
in
their
poetry
in
their
prose
in
their
politics
and
in
their
tempers
no
two
men
can
be
more
unlike
if
sir
walter
scott
may
be
thought
by
some
to
have
been
born
universal
heir
to
all
humanity
it
is
plain
lord
byron
can
set
up
no
such
pretension
he
is
in
a
striking
degree
the
creature
of
his
own
will
he
holds
no
communion
with
his
kind
but
stands
alone
without
mate
or
fellow
as
if
a
man
were
author
of
himself
and
owned
no
other
kin
he
is
like
a
solitary
peak
all
access
to
which
is
cut
off
not
more
by
elevation
than
distance
he
is
seated
on
a
lofty
eminence
or
reflecting
the
last
rays
of
setting
suns
and
in
his
poetical
moods
reminds
us
of
the
fabled
titans
retired
to
a
ridgy
steep
playing
on
their
and
taking
up
ordinary
men
and
things
in
their
hands
with
haughty
indifference
he
raises
his
subject
to
himself
or
tramples
on
it
he
neither
stoops
to
nor
loses
himself
in
it
he
exists
not
by
sympathy
but
by
antipathy
he
scorns
all
things
even
himself
nature
must
come
to
him
to
sit
for
her
picture
he
does
not
go
to
her
she
must
consult
his
time
his
convenience
and
his
humour
and
wear
a
or
a
fantastic
garb
or
his
lordship
turns
his
back
upon
her
there
is
no
ease
no
unaffected
simplicity
of
manner
no
golden
mean
all
is
strained
or
petulant
in
the
extreme
his
thoughts
are
sphered
and
crystalline
his
style
prouder
than
when
blue
iris
bends
his
spirit
fiery
impatient
wayward
indefatigable
instead
of
taking
his
impressions
from
without
in
entire
and
almost
unimpaired
masses
he
moulds
them
according
to
his
own
temperament
and
heats
the
materials
of
his
imagination
in
the
furnace
of
his
lord
byron
verse
glows
like
a
flame
consuming
every
thing
in
its
way
sir
walter
glides
like
a
river
clear
gentle
harmless
the
poetry
of
the
first
scorches
that
of
the
last
scarcely
warms
the
light
of
the
one
proceeds
from
an
internal
source
ensanguined
sullen
fixed
the
other
reflects
the
hues
of
heaven
or
the
face
of
nature
glancing
vivid
and
various
the
productions
of
the
northern
bard
have
the
rust
and
the
freshness
of
antiquity
about
them
those
of
the
noble
poet
cease
to
startle
from
their
extreme
ambition
of
novelty
both
in
style
and
matter
sir
walter
rhymes
are
silly
sooth
and
dally
with
the
innocence
of
thought
like
the
old
age
his
lordship
muse
spurns
olden
and
affects
all
the
supercilious
airs
of
a
modern
fine
lady
and
an
upstart
the
object
of
the
one
writer
is
to
restore
us
to
truth
and
nature
the
other
chiefly
thinks
how
he
shall
display
his
own
power
or
vent
his
spleen
or
astonish
the
reader
either
by
starting
new
subjects
and
trains
of
speculation
or
by
expressing
old
ones
in
a
more
striking
and
emphatic
manner
than
they
have
been
expressed
before
he
cares
little
what
it
is
he
says
so
that
he
can
say
it
differently
from
others
this
may
account
for
the
charges
of
plagiarism
which
have
been
repeatedly
brought
against
the
noble
poet
if
he
can
borrow
an
image
or
sentiment
from
another
and
heighten
it
by
an
epithet
or
an
allusion
of
greater
force
and
beauty
than
is
to
be
found
in
the
original
passage
he
thinks
he
shews
his
superiority
of
execution
in
this
in
a
more
marked
manner
than
if
the
first
suggestion
had
been
his
own
it
is
not
the
value
of
the
observation
itself
he
is
solicitous
about
but
he
wishes
to
shine
by
contrast
even
nature
only
serves
as
a
foil
to
set
off
his
style
he
therefore
takes
the
thoughts
of
others
whether
contemporaries
or
not
out
of
their
mouths
and
is
content
to
make
them
his
own
to
set
his
stamp
upon
them
by
imparting
to
them
a
more
meretricious
gloss
a
higher
relief
a
greater
loftiness
of
tone
and
a
characteristic
inveteracy
of
purpose
even
in
those
collateral
ornaments
of
modern
style
slovenliness
abruptness
and
eccentricity
as
well
as
in
terseness
and
significance
lord
byron
when
he
pleases
defies
competition
and
surpasses
all
his
contemporaries
whatever
he
does
he
must
do
in
a
more
decided
and
daring
manner
than
any
one
else
he
lounges
with
extravagance
and
yawns
so
as
to
alarm
the
reader
passion
the
love
of
singularity
a
disdain
of
himself
and
of
others
with
a
conscious
sense
that
this
is
among
the
ways
and
means
of
procuring
admiration
are
the
proper
categories
of
his
mind
he
is
a
lordly
writer
is
above
his
own
reputation
and
condescends
to
the
muses
with
a
scornful
grace
lord
byron
who
in
his
politics
is
a
in
his
genius
is
haughty
and
aristocratic
walter
scott
who
is
an
aristocrat
in
principle
is
popular
in
his
writings
and
is
as
it
were
equally
to
nature
and
to
opinion
the
genius
of
sir
walter
is
essentially
imitative
or
denotes
a
foregone
conclusion
that
of
lord
byron
is
or
at
least
requires
no
aid
is
governed
by
no
law
but
the
impulses
of
its
own
will
we
confess
however
much
we
may
admire
independence
of
feeling
and
erectness
of
spirit
in
general
or
practical
questions
yet
in
works
of
genius
we
prefer
him
who
bows
to
the
authority
of
nature
who
appeals
to
actual
objects
to
mouldering
superstitions
to
history
observation
and
tradition
before
him
who
only
consults
the
pragmatical
and
restless
workings
of
his
own
breast
and
gives
them
out
as
oracles
to
the
world
we
like
a
writer
whether
poet
or
who
takes
in
or
is
willing
to
take
in
the
range
of
half
the
universe
in
feeling
character
description
much
better
than
we
do
one
who
obstinately
and
invariably
shuts
himself
up
in
the
bastile
of
his
own
ruling
passions
in
short
we
had
rather
be
sir
walter
scott
meaning
thereby
the
author
of
waverley
than
lord
byron
a
hundred
times
over
and
for
the
reason
just
given
namely
that
he
casts
his
descriptions
in
the
mould
of
nature
never
tiresome
always
interesting
and
always
instructive
instead
of
casting
them
constantly
in
the
mould
of
his
own
individual
impressions
he
gives
us
man
as
he
is
or
as
he
was
in
almost
every
variety
of
situation
action
and
feeling
lord
byron
makes
man
after
his
own
image
woman
after
his
own
heart
the
one
is
a
capricious
tyrant
the
other
a
yielding
slave
he
gives
us
the
misanthrope
and
the
voluptuary
by
turns
and
with
these
two
characters
burning
or
melting
in
their
own
fires
he
makes
out
everlasting
centos
of
himself
he
hangs
the
cloud
the
film
of
his
existence
over
all
outward
things
sits
in
the
centre
of
his
thoughts
and
enjoys
dark
night
bright
day
the
glitter
and
the
gloom
in
cell
monastic
we
see
the
mournful
pall
the
crucifix
the
death
heads
the
faded
chaplet
of
flowers
the
gleaming
tapers
the
agonized
brow
of
genius
the
wasted
form
of
beauty
but
we
are
still
imprisoned
in
a
dungeon
a
curtain
intercepts
our
view
we
do
not
breathe
freely
the
air
of
nature
or
of
our
own
thoughts
the
other
admired
author
draws
aside
the
curtain
and
the
veil
of
egotism
is
rent
and
he
shews
us
the
crowd
of
living
men
and
women
the
endless
groups
the
landscape
the
cloud
and
the
rainbow
and
enriches
our
imaginations
and
relieves
one
passion
by
another
and
expands
and
lightens
reflection
and
takes
away
that
tightness
at
the
breast
which
arises
from
thinking
or
wishing
to
think
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
out
of
a
man
self
in
this
point
of
view
the
author
of
waverley
is
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
of
morality
that
ever
lived
by
emancipating
the
mind
from
petty
narrow
and
bigotted
prejudices
lord
byron
is
the
greatest
pamperer
of
those
prejudices
by
seeming
to
think
there
is
nothing
else
worth
encouraging
but
the
seeds
or
the
full
luxuriant
growth
of
dogmatism
and
in
reading
the
we
never
think
about
the
author
except
from
a
feeling
of
curiosity
respecting
our
unknown
benefactor
in
reading
lord
byron
works
he
himself
is
never
absent
from
our
minds
the
colouring
of
lord
byron
style
however
rich
and
dipped
in
tyrian
dyes
is
nevertheless
opaque
is
in
itself
an
object
of
delight
and
wonder
sir
walter
scott
is
perfectly
transparent
in
studying
the
one
you
seem
to
gaze
at
the
figures
cut
in
stained
glass
which
exclude
the
view
beyond
and
where
the
pure
light
of
heaven
is
only
a
means
of
setting
off
the
gorgeousness
of
art
in
reading
the
other
you
look
through
a
noble
window
at
the
clear
and
varied
landscape
without
or
to
sum
up
the
distinction
in
one
word
sir
walter
scott
is
the
most
writer
now
living
and
lord
byron
is
the
least
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
author
of
waverley
is
in
the
smallest
degree
a
pedant
as
it
would
be
hard
to
persuade
ourselves
that
the
author
of
childe
harold
and
don
juan
is
not
a
coxcomb
though
a
provoking
and
sublime
one
in
this
decided
preference
given
to
sir
walter
scott
over
lord
byron
we
distinctly
include
the
of
the
former
for
we
do
not
think
his
poetry
alone
by
any
means
entitles
him
to
that
precedence
sir
walter
in
his
poetry
though
pleasing
and
natural
is
a
comparative
trifler
it
is
in
his
anonymous
productions
that
he
has
shewn
himself
for
what
he
is
is
the
great
and
prominent
distinction
of
lord
writings
he
seldom
gets
beyond
force
of
style
nor
has
he
produced
any
regular
work
or
masterly
whole
he
does
not
prepare
any
plan
beforehand
nor
revise
and
retouch
what
he
has
written
with
polished
accuracy
his
only
object
seems
to
be
to
stimulate
himself
and
his
readers
for
the
moment
to
keep
both
alive
to
drive
away
to
substitute
a
feverish
and
irritable
state
of
excitement
for
listless
indolence
or
even
calm
enjoyment
for
this
purpose
he
pitches
on
any
subject
at
random
without
much
thought
or
delicacy
he
is
only
impatient
to
begin
and
takes
care
to
adorn
and
enrich
it
as
he
proceeds
with
thoughts
that
breathe
and
words
that
burn
he
composes
as
he
himself
has
said
whether
he
is
in
the
bath
in
his
study
or
on
horseback
he
writes
as
habitually
as
others
talk
or
think
and
whether
we
have
the
inspiration
of
the
muse
or
not
we
always
find
the
spirit
of
the
man
of
genius
breathing
from
his
verse
he
grapples
with
his
subject
and
moves
penetrates
and
animates
it
by
the
electric
force
of
his
own
feelings
he
is
often
monotonous
extravagant
offensive
but
he
is
never
dull
or
tedious
but
when
he
writes
prose
lord
byron
does
not
exhibit
a
new
view
of
nature
or
raise
insignificant
objects
into
importance
by
the
romantic
associations
with
which
he
surrounds
them
but
generally
at
least
takes
thoughts
and
events
and
endeavours
to
express
them
in
stronger
and
statelier
language
than
others
his
poetry
stands
like
a
martello
tower
by
the
side
of
his
subject
he
does
not
like
wordsworth
lift
poetry
from
the
ground
or
create
a
sentiment
out
of
nothing
he
does
not
describe
a
daisy
or
a
periwinkle
but
the
cedar
or
the
cypress
not
poor
men
cottages
but
princes
palaces
his
childe
harold
contains
a
lofty
and
impassioned
review
of
the
great
events
of
history
of
the
mighty
objects
left
as
wrecks
of
time
but
he
dwells
chiefly
on
what
is
familiar
to
the
mind
of
every
has
brought
out
few
new
traits
of
feeling
or
thought
and
has
done
no
more
than
justice
to
the
reader
preconceptions
by
the
sustained
force
and
brilliancy
of
his
style
and
imagery
lord
earlier
productions
the
were
wild
and
gloomy
romances
put
into
rapid
and
shining
verse
they
discover
the
madness
of
poetry
together
with
the
inspiration
sullen
moody
capricious
fierce
inexorable
gloating
on
beauty
thirsting
for
revenge
hurrying
from
the
extremes
of
pleasure
to
pain
but
with
nothing
permanent
nothing
healthy
or
natural
the
gaudy
decorations
and
the
morbid
sentiments
remind
one
of
flowers
strewed
over
the
face
of
death
in
his
as
has
been
just
observed
he
assumes
a
lofty
and
philosophic
tone
and
reasons
high
of
providence
will
and
fate
he
takes
the
highest
points
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
comments
on
them
from
a
more
commanding
eminence
he
shews
us
the
crumbling
monuments
of
time
he
invokes
the
great
names
the
mighty
spirit
of
antiquity
the
universe
is
changed
into
a
stately
mausoleum
in
solemn
measures
he
chaunts
a
hymn
to
fame
lord
byron
has
strength
and
elevation
enough
to
fill
up
the
moulds
of
our
classical
and
recollections
and
to
rekindle
the
earliest
aspirations
of
the
mind
after
greatness
and
true
glory
with
a
pen
of
fire
the
names
of
tasso
of
ariosto
of
dante
of
cincinnatus
of
caesar
of
scipio
lose
nothing
of
their
pomp
or
their
lustre
in
his
hands
and
when
he
begins
and
continues
a
strain
of
panegyric
on
such
subjects
we
indeed
sit
down
with
him
to
a
banquet
of
rich
praise
brooding
over
imperishable
glories
till
contemplation
has
her
fill
lord
byron
seems
to
cast
himself
indignantly
from
this
bank
and
shoal
of
time
or
the
frail
tottering
bark
that
bears
up
modern
reputation
into
the
huge
sea
of
ancient
renown
and
to
revel
there
with
untired
outspread
plume
even
this
in
him
is
spleen
his
contempt
of
his
contemporaries
makes
him
turn
back
to
the
lustrous
past
or
project
himself
forward
to
the
dim
future
lord
byron
tragedies
faliero
b
sardanapalus
are
not
equal
to
his
other
works
they
want
the
essence
of
the
drama
they
abound
in
speeches
and
descriptions
such
as
he
himself
might
make
either
to
himself
or
others
lolling
on
his
couch
of
a
morning
but
do
not
carry
the
reader
out
of
the
poet
mind
to
the
scenes
and
events
recorded
they
have
neither
action
character
nor
interest
but
are
a
sort
of
tragedies
spun
out
and
glittering
and
spreading
a
flimsy
veil
over
the
face
of
nature
yet
he
spins
them
on
of
all
that
he
has
done
in
this
way
the
and
the
same
subject
as
moore
of
the
is
the
best
we
prefer
it
even
to
is
merely
himself
with
a
on
but
in
the
dramatic
fragment
published
in
the
the
space
between
heaven
and
earth
the
stage
on
which
his
characters
have
to
pass
to
and
fro
seems
to
fill
his
imagination
and
the
deluge
which
he
has
so
finely
described
may
be
said
to
have
drowned
all
his
own
idle
humours
we
must
say
we
think
little
of
our
author
turn
for
satire
his
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
is
dogmatical
and
insolent
but
without
refinement
or
point
he
calls
people
names
and
tries
to
transfix
a
character
with
an
epithet
which
does
not
stick
because
it
has
no
other
foundation
than
his
own
petulance
and
spite
or
he
endeavours
to
degrade
by
alluding
to
some
circumstance
of
external
situation
he
says
of
wordsworth
poetry
that
it
is
his
aversion
that
may
be
but
whose
fault
is
it
this
is
the
satire
of
a
lord
who
is
accustomed
to
have
all
his
whims
or
dislikes
taken
for
gospel
and
who
can
not
be
at
the
pains
to
do
more
than
signify
his
contempt
or
displeasure
if
a
great
man
meets
with
a
rebuff
which
he
does
not
like
he
turns
on
his
heel
and
this
passes
for
a
repartee
the
noble
author
says
of
a
celebrated
barrister
and
critic
that
he
was
born
in
a
garret
sixteen
stories
high
the
insinuation
is
not
true
or
if
it
were
it
is
low
the
allusion
degrades
the
person
who
makes
not
him
to
whom
it
is
applied
this
is
also
the
satire
of
a
person
of
birth
and
quality
who
measures
all
merit
by
external
rank
that
is
by
his
own
standard
so
his
lordship
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
my
grandmother
review
addresses
him
fifty
times
as
dear
nor
is
there
any
other
wit
in
the
article
this
is
surely
a
mere
assumption
of
superiority
from
his
lordship
rank
and
is
the
sort
of
he
might
use
to
a
person
who
came
to
hire
himself
as
a
valet
to
him
at
the
waiters
might
laugh
the
public
will
not
in
like
manner
in
the
controversy
about
pope
he
claps
bowles
on
the
back
with
a
coarse
facetious
familiarity
as
if
he
were
his
chaplain
whom
he
had
invited
to
dine
with
him
or
was
about
to
present
to
a
benefice
the
reverend
divine
might
submit
to
the
obligation
but
he
has
no
occasion
to
subscribe
to
the
jest
if
it
is
a
jest
that
bowles
should
be
a
parson
and
lord
byron
a
peer
the
world
knew
this
before
there
was
no
need
to
write
a
pamphlet
to
prove
it
the
indeed
has
great
power
but
its
power
is
owing
to
the
force
of
the
serious
writing
and
to
the
oddity
of
the
contrast
between
that
and
the
flashy
passages
with
which
it
is
interlarded
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
there
is
but
one
step
you
laugh
and
are
surprised
that
any
one
should
turn
round
and
himself
the
drollery
is
in
the
utter
discontinuity
of
ideas
and
feelings
he
makes
virtue
serve
as
a
foil
to
vice
is
for
want
of
any
other
a
variety
of
genius
a
classical
intoxication
is
followed
by
the
splashing
of
by
frothy
effusions
of
ordinary
bile
after
the
lightning
and
the
hurricane
we
are
introduced
to
the
interior
of
the
cabin
and
the
contents
of
basins
the
solemn
hero
of
tragedy
plays
in
the
farce
this
is
very
tolerable
and
not
to
be
endured
the
noble
lord
is
almost
the
only
writer
who
has
prostituted
his
talents
in
this
way
he
hallows
in
order
to
desecrate
takes
a
pleasure
in
defacing
the
images
of
beauty
his
hands
have
wrought
and
raises
our
hopes
and
our
belief
in
goodness
to
heaven
only
to
dash
them
to
the
earth
again
and
break
them
in
pieces
the
more
effectually
from
the
very
height
they
have
fallen
our
enthusiasm
for
genius
or
virtue
is
thus
turned
into
a
jest
by
the
very
person
who
has
kindled
it
and
who
thus
fatally
quenches
the
sparks
of
both
it
is
not
that
lord
byron
is
sometimes
serious
and
sometimes
trifling
sometimes
profligate
and
sometimes
moral
but
when
he
is
most
serious
and
most
moral
he
is
only
preparing
to
mortify
the
unsuspecting
reader
by
putting
a
pitiful
upon
him
this
is
a
most
unaccountable
anomaly
it
is
as
if
the
eagle
were
to
build
its
eyry
in
a
common
sewer
or
the
owl
were
seen
soaring
to
the
sun
such
a
sight
might
make
one
laugh
but
one
would
not
wish
or
expect
it
to
occur
more
than
once
c
in
fact
lord
byron
is
the
spoiled
child
of
fame
as
well
as
fortune
he
has
taken
a
surfeit
of
popularity
and
is
not
contented
to
delight
unless
he
can
shock
the
public
he
would
force
them
to
admire
in
spite
of
decency
and
common
sense
he
would
have
them
read
what
they
would
read
in
no
one
but
himself
or
he
would
not
give
a
rush
for
their
applause
he
is
to
be
a
chartered
libertine
from
whom
insults
are
favours
whose
contempt
is
to
be
a
new
incentive
to
admiration
his
lordship
is
hard
to
please
he
is
equally
averse
to
notice
or
neglect
enraged
at
censure
and
scorning
praise
he
tries
the
patience
of
the
town
to
the
very
utmost
and
when
they
shew
signs
of
weariness
or
disgust
threatens
to
them
he
says
he
will
write
on
whether
he
is
read
or
not
he
would
never
write
another
page
if
it
were
not
to
court
popular
applause
or
to
affect
a
superiority
over
it
in
this
respect
also
lord
byron
presents
a
striking
contrast
to
sir
walter
scott
the
latter
takes
what
part
of
the
public
favour
falls
to
his
share
without
grumbling
to
be
sure
he
has
no
reason
to
complain
the
former
is
always
quarrelling
with
the
world
about
his
of
applause
the
of
vanity
and
ungraciously
throwing
the
offerings
of
incense
heaped
on
his
shrine
back
in
the
faces
of
his
admirers
again
there
is
no
taint
in
the
writings
of
the
author
of
waverley
all
is
fair
and
natural
and
he
never
outrages
the
public
mind
he
introduces
no
anomalous
character
broaches
no
staggering
opinion
if
he
goes
back
to
old
prejudices
and
superstitions
as
a
relief
to
the
modern
reader
while
lord
byron
floats
on
swelling
paradoxes
like
proud
seas
under
him
if
the
one
defers
too
much
to
the
spirit
of
antiquity
the
other
panders
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
goes
to
the
very
edge
of
extreme
and
licentious
speculation
and
breaks
his
neck
over
it
grossness
and
levity
are
the
playthings
of
his
pen
it
is
a
ludicrous
circumstance
that
he
should
have
dedicated
his
to
the
worthy
baronet
did
the
latter
ever
acknowledge
the
obligation
we
are
not
nice
not
very
nice
but
we
do
not
particularly
approve
those
subjects
that
shine
chiefly
from
their
rottenness
nor
do
we
wish
to
see
the
muses
drest
out
in
the
flounces
of
a
false
or
questionable
philosophy
like
and
in
the
garb
of
doctors
of
law
we
like
metaphysics
as
well
as
lord
byron
but
not
to
see
them
making
flowery
speeches
nor
dancing
a
measure
in
the
fetters
of
verse
we
have
as
good
as
hinted
that
his
lordship
poetry
consists
mostly
of
a
tissue
of
superb
even
his
paradoxes
are
they
are
familiar
in
the
schools
they
are
only
new
and
striking
in
his
dramas
and
stanzas
by
being
out
of
place
in
a
word
we
think
that
poetry
moves
best
within
the
circle
of
nature
and
received
opinion
speculative
theory
and
subtle
casuistry
are
forbidden
ground
to
it
but
lord
byron
often
wanders
into
this
ground
wantonly
wilfully
and
unwarrantably
the
only
apology
we
can
conceive
for
the
spirit
of
some
of
lord
byron
writings
is
the
spirit
of
some
of
those
opposed
to
him
they
would
provoke
a
man
to
write
any
thing
farthest
from
them
is
best
the
extravagance
and
license
of
the
one
seems
a
proper
antidote
to
the
bigotry
and
narrowness
of
the
other
the
first
of
was
a
to
the
second
though
none
but
itself
could
be
its
parallel
perhaps
the
chief
cause
of
most
of
lord
byron
errors
is
that
he
is
that
anomaly
in
letters
and
in
society
a
noble
poet
it
is
a
double
privilege
almost
too
much
for
humanity
he
has
all
the
pride
of
birth
and
genius
the
strength
of
his
imagination
leads
him
to
indulge
in
fantastic
opinions
the
elevation
of
his
rank
sets
censure
at
defiance
he
becomes
a
pampered
egotist
he
has
a
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
a
niche
in
the
temple
of
fame
mortals
opinions
things
are
not
good
enough
for
him
to
touch
or
think
of
a
mere
nobleman
is
in
his
estimation
but
the
tenth
transmitter
of
a
foolish
face
a
mere
man
of
genius
is
no
better
than
a
worm
his
muse
is
also
a
lady
of
quality
the
people
are
not
polite
enough
for
him
the
court
not
sufficiently
intellectual
he
hates
the
one
and
despises
the
other
by
hating
and
despising
others
he
does
not
learn
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
a
fastidious
man
soon
grows
querulous
and
splenetic
if
there
is
nobody
but
ourselves
to
come
up
to
our
idea
of
fancied
perfection
we
easily
get
tired
of
our
idol
when
a
man
is
tired
of
what
he
is
by
a
natural
perversity
he
sets
up
for
what
he
is
not
if
he
is
a
poet
he
pretends
to
be
a
metaphysician
if
he
is
a
patrician
in
rank
and
feeling
he
would
fain
be
one
of
the
people
his
ruling
motive
is
not
the
love
of
the
people
but
of
distinction
not
of
truth
but
of
singularity
he
patronizes
men
of
letters
out
of
vanity
and
deserts
them
from
caprice
or
from
the
advice
of
friends
he
embarks
in
an
obnoxious
publication
to
provoke
censure
and
leaves
it
to
shift
for
itself
for
fear
of
scandal
we
do
not
like
sir
walter
gratuitous
servility
we
like
lord
preposterous
little
better
he
may
affect
the
principles
of
equality
but
he
resumes
his
privilege
of
peerage
upon
occasion
his
lordship
has
made
great
offers
of
service
to
the
greeks
money
and
horses
he
is
at
present
in
cephalonia
waiting
the
event
we
had
written
thus
far
when
news
came
of
the
death
of
lord
byron
and
put
an
end
at
once
to
a
strain
of
somewhat
peevish
invective
which
was
intended
to
meet
his
eye
not
to
insult
his
memory
had
we
known
that
we
were
writing
his
epitaph
we
must
have
done
it
with
a
different
feeling
as
it
is
we
think
it
better
and
more
like
himself
to
let
what
we
had
written
stand
than
to
take
up
our
leaden
shafts
and
try
to
melt
them
into
tears
of
sensibility
or
mould
them
into
dull
praise
and
an
affected
shew
of
candour
we
were
not
silent
during
the
either
for
his
reproof
or
encouragement
such
us
we
could
give
and
did
not
disdain
to
accept
nor
can
we
now
turn
undertakers
men
to
fix
the
glittering
plate
upon
his
coffin
or
fall
into
the
procession
of
popular
death
cancels
every
thing
but
truth
and
strips
a
man
of
every
thing
but
genius
and
virtue
it
is
a
sort
of
natural
canonization
it
makes
the
meanest
of
us
sacred
it
installs
the
poet
in
his
immortality
and
lifts
him
to
the
skies
death
is
the
great
assayer
of
the
sterling
ore
of
talent
at
his
touch
the
drossy
particles
fall
off
the
irritable
the
personal
the
gross
and
mingle
with
the
dust
the
finer
and
more
ethereal
part
mounts
with
the
winged
spirit
to
watch
over
our
latest
memory
and
protect
our
bones
from
insult
we
consign
the
least
worthy
qualities
to
oblivion
and
cherish
the
nobler
and
imperishable
nature
with
double
pride
and
fondness
nothing
could
shew
the
real
superiority
of
genius
in
a
more
striking
point
of
view
than
the
idle
contests
and
the
public
indifference
about
the
place
of
lord
byron
interment
whether
in
or
his
own
a
king
must
have
a
coronation
a
nobleman
a
the
man
is
nothing
without
the
pageant
the
cemetery
is
the
human
mind
in
which
he
sows
the
seeds
of
never
ending
thought
his
monument
is
to
be
found
in
his
works
nothing
can
cover
his
high
fame
but
heaven
no
pyramids
set
off
his
memory
but
the
eternal
substance
of
his
greatness
lord
byron
is
dead
he
also
died
a
martyr
to
his
zeal
in
the
cause
of
freedom
for
the
last
best
hopes
of
man
let
that
be
his
excuse

attenuates
them
into
the
utmost
degree
of
trembling
softness
but
we
may
complain
in
spite
of
the
delicacy
and
brilliancy
of
the
execution
of
a
want
of
strength
and
solidity
the
author
of
the
of
with
a
richer
and
deeper
vein
of
thought
and
imagination
works
it
out
into
figures
of
equal
grace
and
dazzling
beauty
avoiding
on
the
one
hand
the
tinsel
of
flimsy
affectation
and
on
the
other
the
vices
of
a
rude
and
barbarous
negligence
his
pegasus
is
not
a
rough
skittish
colt
running
wild
among
the
mountains
covered
with
and
thistles
nor
a
tame
sleek
pad
unable
to
get
out
of
the
same
ambling
pace
but
a
beautiful
full
of
life
and
spirit
in
itself
and
subject
to
the
complete
controul
of
the
rider
campbell
gives
scope
to
his
feelings
and
his
fancy
and
embodies
them
in
a
noble
and
naturally
interesting
subject
and
he
at
the
same
time
conceives
himself
called
upon
in
these
days
of
critical
nicety
to
pay
the
exactest
attention
to
the
expression
of
each
thought
and
to
modulate
each
line
into
the
most
faultless
harmony
the
character
of
his
mind
is
a
lofty
and
ambition
that
strives
to
reconcile
the
integrity
of
general
design
with
the
perfect
elaboration
of
each
component
part
that
aims
at
striking
effect
but
is
jealous
of
the
means
by
which
this
is
to
be
produced
our
poet
is
not
averse
to
popularity
nay
he
is
tremblingly
alive
to
it
but
is
the
primary
law
the
indispensable
condition
on
which
it
must
be
obtained
we
should
dread
to
point
out
even
if
we
could
a
false
concord
a
mixed
metaphor
an
imperfect
rhyme
in
any
of
campbell
productions
for
we
think
that
all
his
fame
would
hardly
compensate
to
him
for
the
discovery
he
seeks
for
perfection
and
nothing
evidently
short
of
it
can
satisfy
his
mind
he
is
a
in
poetry
whose
every
work
must
bear
inspection
whose
slightest
touch
is
precious
not
a
coarse
dauber
who
is
contented
to
impose
on
public
wonder
and
credulity
by
some
huge
design
or
who
endeavours
to
wear
out
patience
and
opposition
together
by
a
load
of
lumbering
feeble
awkward
improgressive
lines
on
the
contrary
campbell
labours
to
lend
every
grace
of
execution
to
his
subject
while
he
borrows
his
ardour
and
inspiration
from
it
and
to
deserve
the
laurels
he
has
earned
by
true
genius
and
by
true
pains
there
is
an
apparent
consciousness
of
this
in
most
of
his
writings
he
has
attained
to
great
excellence
by
aiming
at
the
greatest
by
a
cautious
and
yet
daring
selection
of
topics
and
by
studiously
and
with
a
religious
horror
avoiding
all
those
faults
which
arise
from
grossness
vulgarity
haste
and
disregard
of
public
opinion
he
seizes
on
the
highest
point
of
eminence
and
strives
to
keep
it
to
himself
he
snatches
a
grace
beyond
the
reach
of
art
and
will
not
let
it
go
he
steeps
a
single
thought
or
image
so
deep
in
the
tyrian
dyes
of
a
gorgeous
imagination
that
it
throws
its
lustre
over
a
whole
page
every
where
vivid
forms
hover
in
intense
conception
over
the
poet
verse
which
ascends
like
the
aloe
to
the
clouds
with
pure
flowers
at
its
top
or
to
take
an
humbler
comparison
the
pride
of
genius
must
sometimes
stoop
to
the
lowliness
of
criticism
campbell
poetry
often
reminds
us
of
the
purple
gilliflower
both
for
its
colour
and
its
scent
its
glowing
warmth
its
rich
languid
sullen
hue
yet
sweeter
than
the
lids
of
juno
eyes
or
cytherea
breath
there
are
those
who
complain
of
the
little
that
campbell
has
done
in
poetry
and
who
seem
to
insinuate
that
he
is
deterred
by
his
own
reputation
from
making
any
further
or
higher
attempts
but
after
having
produced
two
poems
that
have
gone
to
the
heart
of
a
nation
and
are
gifts
to
a
world
he
may
surely
linger
out
the
rest
of
his
life
in
a
dream
of
immortality
there
are
moments
in
our
lives
so
exquisite
that
all
that
remains
of
them
afterwards
seems
useless
and
barren
and
there
are
lines
and
stanzas
in
our
author
early
writings
in
which
he
may
be
thought
to
have
exhausted
all
the
sweetness
and
all
the
essence
of
poetry
so
that
nothing
farther
was
left
to
his
efforts
or
his
ambition
happy
is
it
for
those
few
and
fortunate
worshippers
of
the
muse
not
a
subject
of
grudging
or
envy
to
others
who
already
enjoy
in
their
a
foretaste
of
their
future
fame
who
see
their
names
accompanying
them
like
a
cloud
of
glory
from
youth
to
age
and
by
the
vision
splendid
are
on
their
way
attended
and
who
know
that
they
have
built
a
shrine
for
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
were
most
dear
to
them
in
the
minds
and
memories
of
other
men
till
the
language
which
they
lisped
in
childhood
is
forgotten
or
the
human
heart
shall
beat
no
more
the
of
alone
would
not
have
called
forth
these
remarks
from
us
but
there
are
passages
in
the
of
of
so
rare
and
ripe
a
beauty
that
they
challenge
as
they
exceed
all
praise
such
for
instance
is
the
following
peerless
description
of
childhood
a
loved
bequest
and
i
may
half
impart
to
those
that
feel
the
strong
paternal
tie
how
like
a
new
existence
in
his
heart
that
living
uprose
beneath
his
eye
dear
as
she
was
from
cherub
infancy
from
hours
when
she
would
round
his
garden
play
to
time
when
as
the
ripening
years
went
by
her
lovely
mind
could
culture
well
repay
and
more
engaging
grew
from
pleasing
day
to
day
i
may
not
paint
those
thousand
infant
charms
unconscious
fascination
undesign
the
orison
repeated
in
his
arms
for
god
to
bless
her
sire
and
all
mankind
the
book
the
bosom
on
his
knee
reclined
or
how
sweet
he
heard
her
con
the
ere
the
teacher
of
her
mind
all
uncompanion
else
her
years
had
gone
till
now
in
gertrude
eyes
their
ninth
blue
summer
shone
and
summer
was
the
tide
and
sweet
the
hour
when
sire
and
daughter
saw
with
fleet
descent
an
indian
from
his
bark
approach
their
bower
of
buskin
limb
and
swarthy
lineament
the
red
wild
feathers
on
his
brow
were
blent
and
bracelets
bound
the
arm
that
help
to
light
a
boy
who
seem
as
he
beside
him
went
of
christian
vesture
and
complexion
bright
led
by
his
dusty
guide
like
morning
brought
by
night
in
the
foregoing
stanzas
we
particularly
admire
the
line
till
now
in
gertrude
eyes
their
ninth
blue
summer
shone
it
appears
to
us
like
the
ecstatic
union
of
natural
beauty
and
poetic
fancy
and
in
its
playful
sublimity
resembles
the
azure
canopy
mirrored
in
the
smiling
waters
bright
liquid
serene
heavenly
a
great
outcry
we
know
has
prevailed
for
some
time
past
against
poetic
diction
and
affected
conceits
and
to
a
certain
degree
we
go
along
with
it
but
this
must
not
prevent
us
from
feeling
the
thrill
of
pleasure
when
we
see
beauty
linked
to
beauty
like
kindred
flame
to
flame
or
from
applauding
the
voluptuous
fancy
that
raises
and
adorns
the
fairy
fabric
of
thought
that
nature
has
begun
pleasure
is
scattered
in
the
earth
beauty
streaks
the
famous
poet
page
in
occasional
lines
of
inconceivable
brightness
and
wherever
this
is
the
case
no
splenetic
censures
or
jealous
leer
malign
no
idle
theories
or
cold
indifference
should
hinder
us
from
greeting
it
with
there
are
other
parts
of
this
poem
equally
delightful
in
which
there
is
a
light
startling
as
the
wing
a
perfume
like
that
of
the
magnolia
a
music
like
the
murmuring
of
pathless
woods
or
of
the
everlasting
ocean
we
conceive
however
that
campbell
excels
chiefly
in
sentiment
and
imagery
the
story
moves
slow
and
is
mechanically
conducted
and
rather
resembles
a
scotch
canal
carried
over
lengthened
aqueducts
and
with
a
number
of
in
it
than
one
of
those
rivers
that
sweep
in
their
majestic
course
broad
and
full
over
transatlantic
plains
and
lose
themselves
in
rolling
gulfs
or
thunder
down
lofty
precipices
but
in
the
centre
the
inmost
recesses
of
our
poet
heart
the
pearly
dew
of
sensibility
is
distilled
and
collects
like
the
diamond
in
the
mine
and
the
structure
of
his
fame
rests
on
the
crystal
columns
of
a
polished
imagination
we
prefer
the
to
the
of
because
with
perhaps
less
brilliancy
there
is
more
of
tenderness
and
natural
imagery
in
the
former
in
the
of
campbell
had
not
completely
emancipated
himself
from
the
trammels
of
the
more
artificial
style
of
poetry
from
epigram
and
antithesis
and
hyperbole
the
best
line
in
it
in
which
earthly
joys
are
said
to
be
like
angels
visits
few
and
far
between
is
a
borrowed
one
a
but
in
the
gertrude
of
wyoming
we
perceive
a
softness
coming
over
the
heart
of
the
author
and
the
scales
and
crust
of
formality
that
fence
in
his
couplets
and
give
them
a
somewhat
glittering
and
rigid
appearance
fall
off
and
he
has
succeeded
in
engrafting
the
wild
and
more
expansive
interest
of
the
romantic
school
of
poetry
on
classic
elegance
and
precision
after
the
poem
we
have
just
named
campbell
songs
are
the
happiest
efforts
of
his
muse
breathing
freshness
blushing
like
the
morn
they
seem
like
clustering
roses
to
weave
a
chaplet
for
love
and
liberty
or
their
bleeding
words
gush
out
in
mournful
and
hurried
succession
like
ruddy
drops
that
visit
the
sad
heart
of
thoughtful
humanity
the
of
is
of
all
modern
compositions
the
most
lyrical
in
spirit
and
in
sound
to
justify
this
encomium
we
need
only
recall
the
lines
to
the
reader
memory
on
linden
when
the
sun
was
low
all
bloodless
lay
th
untrodden
snow
and
dark
as
winter
was
the
flow
of
iser
rolling
rapidly
but
linden
saw
another
sight
when
the
drum
beat
at
dead
of
night
commanding
fires
of
death
to
light
the
darkness
of
her
scenery
by
torch
and
trumpet
fast
array
each
horseman
drew
his
battle
blade
and
furious
every
charger
neigh
to
join
the
dreadful
revelry
then
shook
the
hills
with
thunder
then
rush
the
steed
to
battle
and
louder
than
the
bolts
of
far
flash
the
red
artillery
but
redder
yet
that
light
shall
glow
on
linden
hills
of
stained
snow
and
bloodier
yet
the
torrent
flow
of
iser
rolling
rapidly
is
morn
but
scarce
yon
level
sun
can
pierce
the
rolling
b
dun
where
furious
frank
and
fiery
hun
shout
in
their
canopy
the
combat
deepens
on
ye
brave
who
rush
to
glory
or
the
grave
wave
munich
all
thy
banners
wave
and
charge
with
all
thy
chivalry
few
few
shall
part
where
many
meet
the
snow
shall
be
their
and
every
turf
beneath
their
feet
shall
be

sepulchre
campbell
on
contemporary
and
other
poets
which
have
appeared
in
the
new
monthly
magazine
are
in
a
style
at
once
chaste
temperate
guarded
and
just
crabbe
presents
an
entire
contrast
to
campbell
the
one
is
the
most
ambitious
and
aspiring
of
living
poets
the
other
the
most
humble
and
prosaic
if
the
poetry
of
the
one
is
like
the
arch
of
the
rainbow
spanning
and
adorning
the
earth
that
of
the
other
is
like
a
dull
leaden
cloud
hanging
over
it
style
might
be
cited
as
an
answer
to
audrey
question
is
poetry
a
true
thing
there
are
here
no
ornaments
no
flights
of
fancy
no
illusions
of
sentiment
no
tinsel
of
words
his
song
is
one
sad
reality
one
unraised
unvaried
note
of
unavailing
woe
literal
fidelity
serves
him
in
the
place
of
invention
he
assumes
importance
by
a
number
of
petty
details
he
rivets
attention
by
being
tedious
he
not
only
deals
in
incessant
matters
of
fact
but
in
matters
of
fact
of
the
most
familiar
the
least
animating
and
the
most
unpleasant
kind
but
he
relies
for
the
effect
of
novelty
on
the
microscopic
minuteness
with
which
he
dissects
the
most
trivial
objects
and
for
the
interest
he
excites
on
the
unshrinking
determination
with
which
he
handles
the
most
painful
his
poetry
has
an
official
and
professional
air
he
is
called
in
to
cases
of
difficult
births
of
fractured
limbs
or
breaches
of
the
peace
and
makes
out
a
parochial
list
of
accidents
and
offences
he
takes
the
most
trite
the
most
gross
and
obvious
and
revolting
part
of
nature
for
the
subject
of
his
elaborate
descriptions
but
it
is
nature
still
and
nature
is
a
great
and
mighty
goddess
it
is
well
for
the
reverend
author
that
it
is
so
individuality
is
in
his
theory
the
only
definition
of
poetry
whatever
he
hitches
into
rhyme
whoever
makes
an
exact
image
of
any
thing
on
the
earth
however
deformed
or
insignificant
according
to
him
must
succeed
and
he
himself
has
succeeded
crabbe
is
one
of
the
most
popular
and
admired
of
our
living
authors
that
he
is
so
can
be
accounted
for
on
no
other
principle
than
the
strong
ties
that
bind
us
to
the
world
about
us
and
our
involuntary
yearnings
after
whatever
in
any
manner
powerfully
and
directly
reminds
us
of
it
his
muse
is
not
one
of
daughters
of
but
the
old
toothless
mumbling
dame
herself
doling
out
the
gossip
and
scandal
of
the
neighbourhood
recounting
verbis
et
what
happens
in
every
place
of
the
kingdom
every
hour
in
the
year
and
fastening
always
on
the
worst
as
the
most
palatable
morsels
but
she
is
a
circumstantial
old
lady
communicative
scrupulous
leaving
nothing
to
the
imagination
harping
on
the
smallest
grievances
a
and
critic
most
veritable
most
identical
bringing
us
acquainted
with
persons
and
things
just
as
they
chanced
to
exist
and
giving
us
a
local
interest
in
all
she
knows
and
tells
helicon
is
choked
up
with
weeds
and
corruption
it
reflects
no
light
from
heaven
it
emits
no
cheerful
sound
no
flowers
of
love
of
hope
or
joy
spring
up
near
it
or
they
bloom
only
to
wither
in
a
moment
our
poet
verse
does
not
put
a
spirit
of
youth
in
every
thing
but
a
spirit
of
fear
despondency
and
decay
it
is
not
an
electric
spark
to
kindle
or
expand
but
acts
like
the
torpedo
touch
to
deaden
or
contract
it
lends
no
dazzling
tints
to
fancy
it
aids
no
soothing
feelings
in
the
heart
it
gladdens
no
prospect
it
stirs
no
wish
in
its
view
the
current
of
life
runs
slow
dull
cold
dispirited
half
under
ground
muddy
and
clogged
with
all
creeping
things
the
world
is
one
vast
infirmary
the
hill
of
parnassus
is
a
penitentiary
of
which
our
author
is
the
overseer
to
read
him
is
a
penance
yet
we
read
on
crabbe
it
must
be
confessed
is
a
repulsive
writer
he
contrives
to
turn
diseases
to
commodities
and
makes
a
virtue
of
necessity
he
puts
us
out
of
conceit
with
this
world
which
perhaps
a
severe
divine
should
do
yet
does
not
as
a
charitable
divine
ought
point
to
another
his
morbid
feelings
droop
and
cling
to
the
earth
grovel
where
they
should
soar
and
throw
a
dead
weight
on
every
aspiration
of
the
soul
after
the
good
or
beautiful
by
degrees
we
submit
and
are
reconciled
to
our
fate
like
patients
to
the
physician
or
prisoners
in
the
condemned
cell
we
can
only
explain
this
by
saying
as
we
said
before
that
crabbe
gives
us
one
part
of
nature
the
mean
the
little
the
disgusting
the
distressing
that
he
does
this
thoroughly
and
like
a
master
and
we
forgive
all
the
rest
crabbe
first
poems
were
published
so
long
ago
as
the
year
and
received
the
approbation
of
johnson
only
a
little
before
he
died
this
was
a
testimony
from
an
enemy
for
johnson
was
not
an
admirer
of
the
simple
in
style
or
minute
in
description
still
he
was
an
acute
man
and
could
see
truth
when
it
was
presented
to
him
even
through
the
mist
of
his
prejudices
and
his
foibles
there
was
something
in
crabbe
intricate
points
that
did
not
after
all
so
ill
accord
with
the
doctor
purblind
vision
and
he
knew
quite
enough
of
the
petty
ills
of
life
to
judge
of
the
merit
of
our
descriptions
though
he
himself
chose
to
slur
them
over
in
dogmas
or
general
invectives
crabbe
earliest
poem
of
the
was
recommended
to
the
notice
of
johnson
by
sir
joshua
reynolds
and
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
a
taste
for
that
sort
of
poetry
which
leans
for
support
on
the
truth
and
fidelity
of
its
imitations
of
nature
began
to
display
itself
much
about
that
time
and
in
a
good
measure
in
consequence
of
the
direction
of
the
public
taste
to
the
subject
of
painting
the
accumulation
of
wordy
the
gaudy
pretensions
of
poetical
fiction
had
enfeebled
and
perverted
our
eye
for
nature
the
study
of
the
fine
arts
which
came
into
fashion
about
forty
years
ago
and
was
then
first
considered
as
a
polite
accomplishment
would
tend
imperceptibly
to
restore
it
painting
is
essentially
an
imitative
art
it
can
not
subsist
for
a
moment
on
empty
generalities
the
critic
therefore
who
had
been
used
to
this
sort
of
substantial
entertainment
would
be
disposed
to
read
poetry
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
would
be
little
captivated
with
smooth
polished
unmeaning
periods
and
would
turn
with
double
eagerness
and
relish
to
the
force
and
precision
of
individual
details
transferred
as
it
were
to
the
page
from
the
canvas
thus
an
admirer
of
teniers
or
hobbima
might
think
little
of
the
pastoral
sketches
of
pope
or
goldsmith
even
thompson
describes
not
so
much
the
naked
object
as
what
he
sees
in
his
mind
eye
surrounded
and
glowing
with
the
mild
bland
genial
vapours
of
his
brain
but
the
adept
in
dutch
interiors
hovels
and
must
find
in
crabbe
a
man
after
his
own
heart
he
is
the
very
thing
itself
he
paints
in
words
instead
of
colours
there
is
no
other
difference
as
crabbe
is
not
a
painter
only
because
he
does
not
use
a
brush
and
colours
so
he
is
for
the
most
part
a
poet
only
because
he
writes
in
lines
of
ten
syllables
all
the
rest
might
be
found
in
a
newspaper
an
old
magazine
or
a
our
author
is
himself
a
little
jealous
of
the
prudish
fidelity
of
his
homely
muse
and
tries
to
justify
himself
by
precedents
he
brings
as
a
parallel
instance
of
merely
literal
description
pope
lines
on
the
gay
duke
of
buckingham
beginning
in
the
worst
inn
worst
room
see
villiers
lies
but
surely
nothing
can
be
more
dissimilar
pope
describes
what
is
striking
crabbe
would
have
described
merely
what
was
there
the
objects
in
pope
stand
out
to
the
fancy
from
the
mixture
of
the
mean
with
the
gaudy
from
the
contrast
of
the
scene
and
the
character
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
imagination
you
see
what
is
passing
in
a
poetical
point
of
view
in
crabbe
there
is
no
foil
no
contrast
no
impulse
given
to
the
mind
it
is
all
on
a
level
and
of
a
piece
in
fact
there
is
so
little
connection
between
the
of
crabbe
lines
and
the
ornament
of
rhyme
which
is
tacked
to
them
that
many
of
his
verses
read
like
serious
burlesque
and
the
parodies
which
have
been
made
upon
them
are
hardly
so
quaint
as
the
originals
crabbe
great
fault
is
certainly
that
he
is
a
sickly
a
querulous
a
uniformly
dissatisfied
poet
he
sings
the
country
and
he
sings
it
in
a
pitiful
tone
he
chooses
this
subject
only
to
take
the
charm
out
of
it
and
to
dispel
the
illusion
the
glory
and
the
dream
which
had
hovered
over
it
in
golden
verse
from
theocritus
to
cowper
he
sets
out
with
professing
to
overturn
the
theory
which
had
hallowed
a
life
and
made
the
names
of
grove
and
valley
music
to
our
ears
in
order
to
give
us
truth
in
its
stead
but
why
not
lay
aside
the
fool
cap
and
bells
at
once
why
not
insist
on
the
unwelcome
reality
in
plain
prose
if
our
author
is
a
poet
why
trouble
himself
with
statistics
if
he
is
a
statistic
writer
why
set
his
ill
news
to
harsh
and
grating
verse
the
philosopher
in
painting
the
dark
side
of
human
nature
may
have
reason
on
his
side
and
a
moral
lesson
or
remedy
in
view
the
tragic
poet
who
shews
the
sad
vicissitudes
of
things
and
the
disappointments
of
the
passions
at
least
strengthens
our
yearnings
after
imaginary
good
and
lends
wings
to
our
desires
by
which
we
at
one
bound
high
overleap
all
bound
of
actual
suffering
but
crabbe
does
neither
he
gives
us
discoloured
paintings
of
life
helpless
repining
unprofitable
unedifying
distress
he
is
not
a
philosopher
but
a
sophist
a
misanthrope
in
verse
a
mandeville
a
malthus
turned
metrical
romancer
he
professes
historical
fidelity
but
his
vein
is
not
dramatic
nor
does
he
give
us
the
and
of
that
versatile
gipsey
nature
he
does
not
indulge
his
fancy
or
sympathise
with
us
or
tell
us
how
the
poor
feel
but
how
he
should
feel
in
their
situation
which
we
do
not
want
to
know
he
does
not
weave
the
web
of
their
lives
of
a
mingled
yarn
good
and
ill
together
but
clothes
them
all
in
the
same
dingy
or
tinges
them
with
a
green
and
yellow
melancholy
he
blocks
out
all
possibility
of
good
cancels
the
hope
or
even
the
wish
for
it
as
a
weakness
tityrus
and
virgil
at
the
game
of
pastoral
disables
all
his
adversary
white
pieces
and
leaves
none
but
black
ones
on
the
board
the
situation
of
a
country
clergyman
is
not
necessarily
favourable
to
the
cultivation
of
the
muse
he
is
set
down
perhaps
as
he
thinks
in
a
small
curacy
for
life
and
he
takes
his
revenge
by
imprisoning
the
reader
imagination
in
luckless
verse
shut
out
from
social
converse
from
learned
colleges
and
halls
where
he
passed
his
youth
he
has
no
cordial
with
the
unlettered
manners
of
the
or
the
and
he
describes
his
neighbours
as
more
uncomfortable
and
discontented
than
himself
all
this
while
he
dedicates
successive
volumes
to
rising
generations
of
noble
patrons
and
while
he
desolates
a
line
of
coast
with
sterile
blighting
lines
the
only
leaf
of
his
books
where
honour
beauty
worth
or
pleasure
bloom
is
that
inscribed
to
the
rutland
family
we
might
adduce
instances
of
what
we
have
said
from
every
page
of
his
works
let
one
suffice
thus
by
himself
compelled
to
live
each
day
to
wait
for
certain
hours
the
tide
delay
at
the
same
times
the
same
dull
views
to
see
the
bounding
and
the
blighted
tree
the
water
only
when
the
tides
were
high
when
low
the
mud
and
the
tar
that
blisters
on
the
planks
and
stakes
in
their
uneven
ranks
heaps
of
entangled
weeds
that
slowly
float
as
the
tide
rolls
by
the
impeded
boat
when
tides
were
neap
and
in
the
sultry
day
through
the
tall
bounding
made
their
way
which
on
each
side
rose
swelling
and
below
the
dark
warm
flood
ran
silently
and
slow
there
anchoring
peter
chose
from
man
to
hide
there
hang
his
head
and
view
the
lazy
tide
in
its
hot
slimy
channel
slowly
glide
where
the
small
eels
that
left
the
deeper
way
for
the
warm
shore
within
the
shallows
play
where
gaping
muscles
left
upon
the
mud
slope
their
slow
passage
to
the
flood
here
dull
and
hopeless
he
lie
down
and
trace
how
crabs
had
crawled
their
crooked
race
or
sadly
listen
to
the
tuneless
cry
of
fishing
gull
or
clanging
what
time
the
to
the
marsh
would
come
and
the
loud
bittern
from
the
home
gave
from
the
salt
the
bellowing
boom
he
nursed
the
feelings
these
dull
scenes
produce
and
loved
to
stop
beside
the
opening
sluice
where
the
small
stream
confined
in
narrow
bound
ran
with
a
dull
unvaried
saddening
sound
where
all
presented
to
the
eye
or
ear
oppressed
the
soul
with
misery
grief
and
fear
this
is
an
exact
of
some
of
the
most
unlovely
parts
of
the
creation
indeed
the
whole
of
crabbe
from
which
the
above
passage
is
taken
is
done
so
to
the
life
that
it
seems
almost
like
some
crawled
out
of
the
neighbouring
slime
and
harbouring
a
breed
of
strange
vermin
with
a
strong
local
scent
of
tar
and
crabbe
are
more
readable
than
his
but
in
proportion
as
the
interest
increases
they
become
more
oppressive
they
turn
one
and
all
upon
the
same
sort
of
teazing
helpless
mechanical
unimaginative
distress
and
though
it
is
not
easy
to
lay
them
down
you
never
wish
to
take
them
up
again
still
in
this
way
they
are
highly
finished
striking
and
original
portraits
worked
out
with
an
eye
to
nature
and
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
small
and
intricate
folds
of
the
human
heart
some
of
the
best
are
the
the
story
of
the
the
the
episode
of
in
the
is
one
of
the
most
tender
and
pensive
and
the
character
of
the
methodist
parson
who
persecutes
the
sailor
widow
with
his
godly
selfish
love
is
one
of
the
most
profound
in
a
word
if
crabbe
writings
do
not
add
greatly
to
the
store
of
entertaining
and
delightful
fiction
yet
they
will
remain
as
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
poetry
perhaps
for
a
century
to
come
footnote
a
like
angels
visits
short
and
far
footnote
b
is
not
this
word
which
occurs
in
the
last
line
but
one
as
well
as
before
an
instance
of
that
repetition
which
we
so
often
meet
with
in
the
most
correct
and
elegant
writers
sir
james
mackintosh
the
subject
of
the
present
article
is
one
of
the
ablest
and
most
accomplished
men
of
the
age
both
as
a
writer
a
speaker
and
a
converser
he
is
in
fact
master
of
almost
every
known
topic
whether
of
a
passing
or
of
a
more
recondite
nature
he
has
lived
much
in
society
and
is
deeply
conversant
with
books
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
scholar
but
the
scholar
gives
the
tone
to
all
his
other
acquirements
and
pursuits
sir
james
is
by
education
and
habit
and
we
were
going
to
add
by
the
original
turn
of
his
mind
a
and
perhaps
he
would
have
passed
his
time
most
happily
and
respectably
had
he
devoted
himself
entirely
to
that
kind
of
life
the
strength
of
his
faculties
would
have
been
best
developed
his
ambition
would
have
met
its
proudest
reward
in
the
accumulation
and
elaborate
display
of
grave
and
useful
knowledge
as
it
is
it
may
be
said
that
in
company
he
talks
well
but
too
much
that
in
writing
he
overlays
the
original
subject
and
spirit
of
the
composition
by
an
appeal
to
authorities
and
by
too
formal
a
method
that
in
public
speaking
the
logician
takes
place
of
the
orator
and
that
he
fails
to
give
effect
to
a
particular
point
or
to
urge
an
immediate
advantage
home
upon
his
adversary
from
the
enlarged
scope
of
his
mind
and
the
wide
career
he
takes
in
the
field
of
argument
to
consider
him
in
the
last
point
of
view
first
as
a
political
partisan
he
is
rather
the
lecturer
than
the
advocate
he
is
able
to
instruct
and
delight
an
impartial
and
disinterested
audience
by
the
extent
of
his
information
by
his
acquaintance
with
general
principles
by
the
clearness
and
aptitude
of
his
illustrations
by
vigour
and
copiousness
of
style
but
where
he
has
a
prejudiced
or
unfair
antagonist
to
contend
with
he
is
just
as
likely
to
put
weapons
into
his
hands
as
to
wrest
them
from
him
and
his
object
seems
to
be
rather
to
deserve
than
to
obtain
success
the
characteristics
of
his
mind
are
retentiveness
and
comprehension
with
facility
of
production
but
he
is
not
equally
remarkable
for
originality
of
view
or
warmth
of
feeling
or
liveliness
of
fancy
his
eloquence
is
a
little
rhetorical
his
reasoning
chiefly
logical
he
can
bring
down
the
account
of
knowledge
on
a
vast
variety
of
subjects
to
the
present
moment
he
can
embellish
any
cause
he
undertakes
by
the
most
approved
and
graceful
ornaments
he
can
support
it
by
a
host
of
facts
and
examples
but
he
can
not
advance
it
a
step
forward
by
placing
it
on
a
new
and
triumphant
nor
can
he
overwhelm
and
break
down
the
artificial
fences
and
bulwarks
of
sophistry
by
the
irresistible
tide
of
manly
enthusiasm
sir
james
mackintosh
is
an
accomplished
debater
rather
than
a
powerful
orator
he
is
distinguished
more
as
a
man
of
wonderful
and
variable
talent
than
as
a
man
of
commanding
intellect
his
mode
of
treating
a
question
is
critical
and
not
parliamentary
it
has
been
formed
in
the
closet
and
the
schools
and
is
hardly
fitted
for
scenes
of
active
life
or
the
collisions
of
sir
james
reasons
on
the
square
while
the
arguments
of
his
opponents
are
loaded
with
iron
or
gold
he
makes
indeed
a
respectable
ally
but
not
a
very
formidable
opponent
he
is
as
likely
however
to
prevail
on
a
neutral
as
he
is
almost
certain
to
be
baffled
on
a
hotly
contested
ground
on
any
question
of
general
policy
or
legislative
improvement
the
member
for
nairn
is
heard
with
advantage
and
his
speeches
are
attended
with
effect
and
he
would
have
equal
weight
and
influence
at
other
times
if
it
were
the
object
of
the
house
to
hear
reason
as
it
is
his
aim
to
speak
it
but
on
subjects
of
peace
or
war
of
political
rights
or
foreign
interference
where
the
waves
of
party
run
high
and
the
liberty
of
nations
or
the
fate
of
mankind
hangs
trembling
in
the
scales
though
he
probably
displays
equal
talent
and
does
full
and
heaped
justice
to
the
question
abstractedly
speaking
or
if
it
were
to
be
tried
before
an
impartial
assembly
yet
we
confess
we
have
seldom
heard
him
on
such
occasions
without
pain
for
the
event
he
did
not
slur
his
own
character
and
pretensions
but
he
compromised
the
argument
he
spoke
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
but
the
house
of
commons
we
dare
aver
it
is
not
the
place
where
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
can
be
spoken
with
safety
or
with
advantage
the
judgment
of
the
house
is
not
a
balance
to
weigh
scruples
and
reasons
to
the
turn
of
a
fraction
another
element
besides
the
love
of
truth
enters
into
the
composition
of
their
decisions
the
reaction
of
which
must
be
calculated
upon
and
guarded
against
if
our
philosophical
statesman
had
to
open
the
case
before
a
class
of
tyros
or
a
circle
of
who
wished
to
form
or
to
strengthen
their
judgments
upon
fair
and
rational
grounds
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
more
luminous
more
able
or
more
decisive
than
the
view
taken
of
it
by
sir
james
mackintosh
but
the
house
of
commons
as
a
collective
body
have
not
the
docility
of
youth
the
calm
wisdom
of
age
and
often
only
want
an
excuse
to
do
wrong
or
to
adhere
to
what
they
have
already
determined
upon
and
sir
james
in
detailing
the
inexhaustible
stores
of
his
memory
and
reading
in
unfolding
the
wide
range
of
his
theory
and
practice
in
laying
down
the
rules
and
the
exceptions
in
insisting
upon
the
advantages
and
the
objections
with
equal
explicitness
would
be
sure
to
let
something
drop
that
a
dextrous
and
watchful
adversary
would
easily
pick
up
and
turn
against
him
if
this
were
found
necessary
or
if
with
so
many
and
doubts
and
difficulties
dilemmas
and
alternatives
thrown
into
it
the
scale
with
its
natural
bias
to
interest
and
power
did
not
already
fly
up
and
kick
the
beam
there
wanted
unity
of
purpose
impetuosity
of
feeling
to
break
through
the
phalanx
of
hostile
and
inveterate
prejudice
arrayed
against
him
he
gave
a
handle
to
his
enemies
threw
in
the
way
of
his
friends
he
raised
so
many
objections
for
the
sake
of
answering
them
proposed
so
many
doubts
for
the
sake
of
solving
them
and
made
so
many
concessions
where
none
were
demanded
that
his
reasoning
had
the
effect
of
neutralizing
itself
it
became
a
mere
exercise
of
the
understanding
without
zest
or
spirit
left
in
it
and
the
provident
engineer
who
was
to
shatter
in
pieces
the
of
corruption
and
oppression
by
a
and
unsparing
discharge
of
artillery
seemed
to
have
brought
not
only
his
own
but
his
own
along
with
him
to
ward
off
the
threatened
mischief
this
was
a
good
deal
the
effect
of
his
maiden
speech
on
the
transfer
of
genoa
to
which
lord
castlereagh
did
not
deign
an
answer
and
which
another
honourable
member
called
a
speech
it
was
a
most
able
candid
closely
argued
and
philosophical
exposure
of
that
unprincipled
transaction
but
for
this
very
reason
it
was
a
solecism
in
the
place
where
it
was
delivered
sir
james
has
since
this
period
and
with
the
help
of
practice
lowered
himself
to
the
tone
of
the
house
and
has
also
applied
himself
to
questions
more
congenial
to
his
habits
of
mind
and
where
the
success
would
be
more
likely
to
be
proportioned
to
his
zeal
and
his
exertions
there
was
a
greater
degree
of
power
or
of
dashing
and
splendid
effect
we
wish
we
could
add
an
equally
humane
and
liberal
spirit
in
the
on
the
law
of
nature
and
formerly
delivered
by
sir
james
then
mackintosh
in
hall
he
shewed
greater
confidence
was
more
at
home
there
the
effect
was
more
electrical
and
instantaneous
and
this
elicited
a
prouder
display
of
intellectual
riches
and
a
more
animated
and
imposing
mode
of
delivery
he
grew
wanton
with
success
dazzling
others
by
the
brilliancy
of
his
acquirements
dazzled
himself
by
the
admiration
they
excited
he
lost
fear
as
well
as
prudence
dared
every
thing
carried
every
thing
before
him
the
modern
philosophy
counterscarp
outworks
citadel
and
all
fell
without
a
blow
by
the
whiff
and
wind
of
his
fell
as
if
it
had
been
a
pack
of
cards
the
volcano
of
the
french
revolution
was
seen
expiring
in
its
own
flames
like
a
made
of
straw
the
principles
of
reform
were
scattered
in
all
directions
like
chaff
before
the
keen
northern
blast
he
laid
about
him
like
one
inspired
nothing
could
withstand
his
envenomed
tooth
like
some
savage
beast
got
into
the
garden
of
the
fabled
hesperides
he
made
clear
work
of
it
root
and
branch
with
white
foaming
tusks
laid
waste
the
borders
and
the
bowers
the
havoc
was
amazing
the
desolation
was
complete
as
to
our
visionary
sceptics
and
utopian
philosophers
they
stood
no
chance
with
our
lecturer
he
did
not
carve
them
as
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
but
hewed
them
as
a
carcase
fit
for
hounds
poor
godwin
who
had
come
in
the
and
candour
of
his
nature
to
hear
what
new
light
had
broken
in
upon
his
old
friend
was
obliged
to
quit
the
field
and
slunk
away
after
an
exulting
taunt
thrown
out
at
such
fanciful
chimeras
as
a
golden
mountain
or
a
perfect
man
mackintosh
had
something
of
the
air
much
of
the
dexterity
and
of
a
political
and
philosophical
juggler
and
an
eager
and
admiring
audience
gaped
and
greedily
swallowed
the
gilded
bait
of
sophistry
prepared
for
their
credulity
and
wonder
those
of
us
who
attended
day
after
day
and
were
accustomed
to
have
all
our
previous
notions
confounded
and
struck
out
of
our
hands
by
some
metaphysical
legerdemain
were
at
last
at
some
loss
to
know
two
and
two
made
till
we
had
heard
the
opinion
on
that
head
he
might
have
some
mental
reservation
on
the
subject
some
pointed
ridicule
to
pour
upon
the
common
supposition
some
learned
authority
to
quote
against
it
to
anticipate
the
line
of
argument
he
might
pursue
was
evidently
presumptuous
and
premature
one
thing
only
appeared
certain
that
whatever
opinion
he
chose
to
take
up
he
was
able
to
make
good
either
by
the
foils
or
the
cudgels
by
gross
banter
or
nice
distinctions
by
a
mixture
of
paradox
and
by
an
appeal
to
vulgar
prejudices
or
startling
scepticism
it
seemed
to
be
equally
his
object
or
the
tendency
of
his
discourses
to
unsettle
every
principle
of
reason
or
of
common
sense
and
to
leave
his
audience
at
the
mercy
of
the
of
a
lawyer
the
nod
of
a
minister
or
the
shout
of
a
mob
to
effect
this
purpose
he
drew
largely
on
the
learning
of
antiquity
on
modern
literature
on
history
poetry
and
the
on
the
schoolmen
and
on
writers
of
novels
french
english
and
italian
in
mixing
up
the
sparkling
julep
that
by
its
potent
operation
was
to
scour
away
the
dregs
and
feculence
and
peccant
humours
of
the
body
politic
he
seemed
to
stand
with
his
back
to
the
drawers
in
a
metaphysical
dispensary
and
to
take
out
of
them
whatever
ingredients
suited
his
purpose
in
this
way
he
had
an
antidote
for
every
error
an
answer
to
every
folly
the
writings
of
burke
hume
berkeley
paley
lord
bacon
jeremy
taylor
grotius
puffendorf
cicero
aristotle
tacitus
livy
sully
machiavel
guicciardini
thuanus
lay
open
beside
him
and
he
could
instantly
lay
his
hand
upon
the
passage
and
quote
them
chapter
and
verse
to
the
clearing
up
of
all
difficulties
and
the
silencing
of
all
oppugners
mackintosh
lectures
were
after
all
but
a
kind
of
philosophical
centos
they
were
profound
brilliant
new
to
his
hearers
but
the
profundity
the
brilliancy
the
novelty
were
not
his
own
he
was
like
pangloss
not
voltaire
but
coleman
who
speaks
only
in
quotations
and
the
pith
the
marrow
of
sir
reasoning
and
rhetoric
at
that
memorable
period
might
be
put
within
inverted
commas
it
however
served
its
purpose
and
the
loud
echo
died
away
we
remember
an
excellent
man
and
a
sound
critic
a
going
to
hear
one
of
these
elaborate
effusions
and
on
his
want
of
enthusiasm
being
accounted
for
from
its
not
being
one
of
the
orator
brilliant
days
he
replied
he
did
not
think
a
man
of
genius
could
speak
for
two
hours
without
saying
something
by
which
he
would
have
been
electrified
we
are
only
sorry
at
this
distance
of
time
for
one
thing
in
these
lectures
the
tone
and
spirit
in
which
they
seemed
to
have
been
composed
and
to
be
delivered
if
all
that
body
of
opinions
and
principles
of
which
the
orator
read
his
recantation
was
unfounded
and
there
was
an
end
of
all
those
views
and
hopes
that
pointed
to
future
improvement
it
was
not
a
matter
of
triumph
or
exultation
to
the
lecturer
or
any
body
else
to
the
young
or
the
old
the
wise
or
the
foolish
on
the
contrary
it
was
a
subject
of
regret
of
slow
reluctant
painful
admission
of
lamentation
loud
heard
through
the
rueful
air
the
immediate
occasion
of
this
sudden
and
violent
change
in
sir
views
and
opinions
was
attributed
to
a
personal
interview
which
he
had
had
a
little
before
his
death
with
burke
at
his
house
at
beaconsfield
in
the
latter
end
of
the
year
appeared
the
from
the
pen
of
the
great
apostate
from
liberty
and
betrayer
of
his
species
into
the
hands
of
those
who
claimed
it
as
their
property
by
divine
right
a
work
imposing
solid
in
many
respects
abounding
in
facts
and
admirable
reasoning
and
in
which
all
flashy
ornaments
were
laid
aside
for
a
testamentary
gravity
the
eloquence
of
despair
resembling
the
throes
and
heaving
and
muttered
threats
of
an
earthquake
rather
than
the
loud
and
soon
after
came
out
a
criticism
on
it
in
monthly
doing
justice
to
the
author
and
the
style
and
combating
the
inferences
with
force
and
at
much
length
but
with
candour
and
with
respect
amounting
to
deference
it
was
new
to
burke
not
to
be
called
names
by
persons
of
the
opposite
party
it
was
an
additional
triumph
to
him
to
be
spoken
well
of
to
be
loaded
with
praise
by
the
author
of
the
it
was
a
testimony
from
an
old
a
powerful
and
an
admired
antagonist
b
he
sent
an
invitation
to
the
writer
to
come
and
see
him
and
in
the
course
of
three
days
animated
discussion
of
such
subjects
mackintosh
became
a
convert
not
merely
to
the
graces
and
gravity
of
burke
style
but
to
the
liberality
of
his
views
and
the
solidity
of
his
the
lectures
were
the
fruit
of
this
interview
such
is
the
influence
exercised
by
men
of
genius
and
imaginative
power
over
those
who
have
nothing
to
oppose
to
their
unforeseen
flashes
of
thought
and
invention
but
the
dry
cold
formal
deductions
of
the
understanding
our
politician
had
time
during
a
few
years
of
absence
from
his
native
country
and
while
the
din
of
war
and
the
cries
of
were
lost
over
a
wide
and
unhearing
ocean
to
recover
from
his
surprise
and
from
a
temporary
alienation
of
mind
and
to
return
in
spirit
and
in
the
mild
and
mellowed
maturity
of
age
to
the
principles
and
attachments
of
his
early
life
the
appointment
of
sir
james
mackintosh
to
a
judgeship
in
india
was
one
which
however
flattering
to
his
vanity
or
favourable
to
his
interests
was
entirely
foreign
to
his
feelings
and
habits
it
was
an
honourable
exile
he
was
out
of
his
element
among
black
slaves
and
sepoys
and
nabobs
and
cadets
and
writers
to
india
he
had
no
one
to
exchange
ideas
with
the
unbought
grace
of
life
the
charm
of
literary
conversation
was
gone
it
was
the
habit
of
his
mind
his
ruling
passion
to
enter
into
the
shock
and
conflict
of
opinions
on
philosophical
political
and
critical
questions
not
to
dictate
to
raw
tyros
or
domineer
over
persons
in
subordinate
situations
but
to
obtain
the
guerdon
and
the
laurels
of
superior
sense
and
information
by
meeting
with
men
of
equal
standing
to
have
a
fair
field
pitched
to
argue
to
distinguish
to
reply
to
hunt
down
the
game
of
intellect
with
eagerness
and
skill
to
push
an
advantage
to
cover
a
retreat
to
give
and
take
a
fall
and
gladly
would
he
learn
and
gladly
teach
it
is
no
wonder
that
this
sort
of
friendly
intellectual
gladiatorship
is
sir
james
greatest
pleasure
for
it
is
his
peculiar
he
has
not
many
equals
and
scarcely
any
superior
in
it
he
is
too
indolent
for
an
author
too
unimpassioned
for
an
orator
but
in
society
he
is
just
vain
enough
to
be
pleased
with
immediate
attention
enough
to
listen
with
patience
to
others
with
great
coolness
and
fluent
communicative
and
with
a
manner
equally
free
from
violence
and
insipidity
few
subjects
can
be
started
on
which
he
is
not
qualified
to
appear
to
advantage
as
the
gentleman
and
scholar
if
there
is
some
tinge
of
pedantry
it
is
carried
off
by
great
affability
of
address
and
variety
of
amusing
and
interesting
topics
there
is
scarce
an
author
that
he
has
not
read
a
period
of
history
that
he
is
not
conversant
with
a
celebrated
name
of
which
he
has
not
a
number
of
anecdotes
to
relate
an
intricate
question
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
enter
upon
in
a
popular
or
scientific
manner
if
an
opinion
in
an
abstruse
metaphysical
author
is
referred
to
he
is
probably
able
to
repeat
the
passage
by
heart
can
tell
the
side
of
the
page
on
which
it
is
to
be
met
with
can
trace
it
back
through
various
descents
to
locke
hobbes
lord
herbert
of
cherbury
to
a
place
in
some
obscure
folio
of
the
or
a
note
in
one
of
the
commentators
on
aristotle
or
plato
and
thus
give
you
in
a
few
moments
space
and
without
any
effort
or
previous
notice
a
chronological
table
of
the
progress
of
the
human
mind
in
that
particular
branch
of
inquiry
there
is
something
we
think
perfectly
admirable
and
delightful
in
an
exhibition
of
this
kind
and
which
is
equally
creditable
to
the
speaker
and
gratifying
to
the
hearer
but
this
kind
of
talent
was
of
no
use
in
india
the
intellectual
wares
of
which
the
chief
judge
delighted
to
make
a
display
were
in
no
request
there
he
languished
after
the
friends
and
the
society
he
had
left
behind
and
wrote
over
incessantly
for
books
from
england
one
that
was
sent
him
at
this
time
was
an
on
the
principles
of
human
and
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
that
dry
tough
metaphysical
shewed
the
dearth
of
intellectual
intercourse
in
which
he
lived
and
the
craving
in
his
mind
after
those
studies
which
had
once
been
his
pride
and
to
which
he
still
turned
for
consolation
in
his
remote
perhaps
to
another
the
novelty
of
the
scene
the
differences
of
mind
and
manners
might
have
atoned
for
a
want
of
social
and
literary
but
sir
james
is
one
of
those
who
see
nature
through
the
spectacles
of
books
he
might
like
to
read
an
account
of
india
but
india
itself
with
its
burning
shining
face
would
be
a
mere
blank
an
endless
waste
to
him
to
persons
of
this
class
of
mind
things
must
be
translated
into
words
visible
images
into
abstract
propositions
to
meet
their
refined
apprehensions
and
they
have
no
more
to
say
to
a
staring
them
in
the
face
without
a
label
in
its
mouth
than
they
would
to
a
hippopotamus
we
may
add
before
we
quit
this
point
that
we
can
not
conceive
of
any
two
persons
more
different
in
colloquial
talents
in
which
they
both
excel
than
sir
james
mackintosh
and
coleridge
they
have
nearly
an
equal
range
of
reading
and
of
topics
of
conversation
but
in
the
mind
of
the
one
we
see
nothing
but
in
the
other
every
thing
is
fluid
the
ideas
of
the
one
are
as
formal
and
tangible
as
those
of
the
other
are
shadowy
and
evanescent
sir
james
mackintosh
walks
over
the
ground
coleridge
is
always
flying
off
from
it
the
first
knows
all
that
has
been
said
upon
a
subject
the
last
has
something
to
say
that
was
never
said
before
if
the
one
deals
too
much
in
learned
the
other
teems
with
idle
fancies
the
one
has
a
good
deal
of
the
of
genius
the
other
is
all
volatile
salt
the
conversation
of
sir
james
mackintosh
has
the
effect
of
reading
a
book
that
of
his
friend
is
like
hearing
a
bewildered
dream
the
one
is
an
encyclopedia
of
knowledge
the
other
is
a
succession
of
as
an
author
sir
james
mackintosh
may
claim
the
foremost
rank
among
those
who
pride
themselves
on
artificial
ornaments
and
acquired
learning
or
who
write
what
may
be
termed
a
style
his
is
a
work
of
great
labour
great
ingenuity
great
brilliancy
and
great
vigour
it
is
a
little
too
antithetical
in
the
structure
of
its
periods
too
dogmatical
in
the
announcement
of
its
opinions
sir
james
has
we
believe
rejected
something
of
the
of
the
one
as
he
has
retracted
some
of
the
abrupt
extravagance
of
the
other
we
apprehend
however
that
our
author
is
not
one
of
those
who
draw
from
their
own
resources
and
accumulated
feelings
or
who
improve
with
age
he
belongs
to
a
class
common
in
scotland
and
elsewhere
who
get
up
on
any
given
subject
in
a
masterly
manner
at
twenty
and
who
at
forty
are
either
where
they
were
or
retrograde
if
they
are
men
of
sense
and
modesty
the
reason
is
their
vanity
is
weaned
after
the
first
and
animal
spirits
of
youth
are
flown
from
making
an
affected
display
of
knowledge
which
however
useful
is
not
their
own
and
may
be
much
more
simply
stated
they
are
tired
of
repeating
the
same
arguments
over
and
over
again
after
having
exhausted
and
rung
the
changes
on
their
whole
stock
for
a
number
of
times
sir
james
mackintosh
is
understood
to
be
a
writer
in
the
edinburgh
review
and
the
articles
attributed
to
him
there
are
full
of
matter
of
great
pith
and
moment
but
they
want
the
trim
pointed
expression
the
ambitious
ornaments
the
ostentatious
display
and
rapid
volubility
of
his
early
productions
we
have
heard
it
objected
to
his
later
compositions
that
his
style
is
good
as
far
as
single
words
and
phrases
are
concerned
but
that
his
sentences
are
clumsy
and
disjointed
and
that
these
make
up
still

this

but
if

be

we
think
we
can
account

it
from

they

wordsworth
wordsworth
genius
is
a
pure
emanation
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
had
he
lived
in
any
other
period
of
the
world
he
would
never
have
been
heard
of
as
it
is
he
has
some
difficulty
to
contend
with
the
hebetude
of
his
intellect
and
the
meanness
of
his
subject
with
him
lowliness
is
young
ambition
ladder
but
he
finds
it
a
toil
to
climb
in
this
way
the
steep
of
fame
his
homely
muse
can
hardly
raise
her
wing
from
the
ground
nor
spread
her
hidden
glories
to
the
sun
he
has
no
figures
nor
no
fantasies
which
busy
draws
in
the
brains
of
men
neither
the
gorgeous
machinery
of
mythologic
lore
nor
the
splendid
colours
of
poetic
diction
his
style
is
vernacular
he
delivers
household
truths
he
sees
nothing
loftier
than
human
hopes
nothing
deeper
than
the
human
heart
this
he
probes
this
he
tampers
with
this
he
poises
with
all
its
incalculable
weight
of
thought
and
feeling
in
his
hands
and
at
the
same
time
calms
the
throbbing
pulses
of
his
own
heart
by
keeping
his
eye
ever
fixed
on
the
face
of
nature
if
he
can
make
the
flow
from
the
wounded
breast
this
is
the
living
colouring
with
which
he
paints
his
verse
if
he
can
assuage
the
pain
or
close
up
the
wound
with
the
balm
of
solitary
musing
or
the
healing
power
of
plants
and
herbs
and
skyey
influences
this
is
the
sole
triumph
of
his
art
he
takes
the
simplest
elements
of
nature
and
of
the
human
mind
the
mere
abstract
conditions
inseparable
from
our
being
and
tries
to
compound
a
new
system
of
poetry
from
them
and
has
perhaps
succeeded
as
well
as
any
one
could
humani
a
me
alienum
is
the
motto
of
his
works
he
thinks
nothing
low
or
indifferent
of
which
this
can
be
affirmed
every
thing
that
professes
to
be
more
than
this
that
is
not
an
absolute
essence
of
truth
and
feeling
he
holds
to
be
vitiated
false
and
spurious
in
a
word
his
poetry
is
founded
on
setting
up
an
opposition
and
pushing
it
to
the
utmost
length
between
the
natural
and
the
artificial
between
the
spirit
of
humanity
and
the
spirit
of
fashion
and
of
the
world
it
is
one
of
the
innovations
of
the
time
it
partakes
of
and
is
carried
along
with
the
revolutionary
movement
of
our
age
the
political
changes
of
the
day
were
the
model
on
which
he
formed
and
conducted
his
poetical
experiments
his
muse
it
can
not
be
denied
and
without
this
we
can
not
explain
its
character
at
all
is
a
levelling
one
it
proceeds
on
a
principle
of
equality
and
strives
to
reduce
all
things
to
the
same
standard
it
is
distinguished
by
a
proud
humility
it
relies
upon
its
own
resources
and
disdains
external
shew
and
relief
it
takes
the
commonest
events
and
objects
as
a
test
to
prove
that
nature
is
always
interesting
from
its
inherent
truth
and
beauty
without
any
of
the
ornaments
of
dress
or
pomp
of
circumstances
to
set
it
off
hence
the
unaccountable
mixture
of
seeming
simplicity
and
real
abstruseness
in
the
fools
have
laughed
at
wise
men
scarcely
understand
them
he
takes
a
subject
or
a
story
merely
as
pegs
or
loops
to
hang
thought
and
feeling
on
the
incidents
are
trifling
in
proportion
to
his
contempt
for
imposing
appearances
the
reflections
are
profound
according
to
the
gravity
and
the
aspiring
pretensions
of
his
mind
his
popular
inartificial
style
gets
rid
at
a
blow
of
all
the
trappings
of
verse
of
all
the
high
places
of
poetry
the
towers
the
solemn
temples
the
gorgeous
palaces
are
swept
to
the
ground
and
like
the
baseless
fabric
of
a
vision
leave
not
a
wreck
behind
all
the
traditions
of
learning
all
the
superstitions
of
age
are
obliterated
and
effaced
we
begin
on
a
of
poetry
the
purple
pall
the
nodding
plume
of
tragedy
are
exploded
as
mere
pantomime
and
trick
to
return
to
the
simplicity
of
truth
and
nature
kings
queens
priests
nobles
the
altar
and
the
throne
the
distinctions
of
rank
birth
wealth
power
the
judge
robe
the
marshall
truncheon
the
ceremony
that
to
great
ones
are
not
to
be
found
here
the
author
tramples
on
the
pride
of
art
with
greater
pride
the
ode
and
epode
the
strophe
and
the
antistrophe
he
laughs
to
scorn
the
harp
of
homer
the
trump
of
pindar
and
of
alcaeus
are
still
the
decencies
of
costume
the
decorations
of
vanity
are
stripped
off
without
mercy
as
barbarous
idle
and
gothic
the
jewels
in
the
crisped
hair
the
diadem
on
the
polished
brow
are
thought
meretricious
theatrical
vulgar
and
nothing
contents
his
fastidious
taste
beyond
a
simple
garland
of
flowers
neither
does
he
avail
himself
of
the
advantages
which
nature
or
accident
holds
out
to
him
he
chooses
to
have
his
subject
a
foil
to
his
invention
to
owe
nothing
but
to
himself
he
gathers
manna
in
the
wilderness
he
strikes
the
barren
rock
for
the
gushing
moisture
he
elevates
the
mean
by
the
strength
of
his
own
aspirations
he
clothes
the
naked
with
beauty
and
grandeur
from
the
store
of
his
own
recollections
no
loads
his
verse
with
perfumes
but
his
imagination
lends
a
sense
of
joy
to
the
bare
trees
and
mountains
bare
and
grass
in
the
green
field
no
storm
no
shipwreck
startles
us
by
its
horrors
but
the
rainbow
lifts
its
head
in
the
cloud
and
the
breeze
sighs
through
the
withered
fern
no
sad
vicissitude
of
fate
no
overwhelming
catastrophe
in
nature
deforms
his
page
but
the
glitters
on
the
bending
flower
the
tear
collects
in
the
glistening
eye
beneath
the
hills
along
the
flowery
vales
the
generations
are
prepared
the
pangs
the
internal
pangs
are
ready
the
dread
strife
of
poor
humanity
afflicted
will
struggling
in
vain
with
ruthless
destiny
as
the
lark
ascends
from
its
low
bed
on
fluttering
wing
and
salutes
the
morning
skies
so
wordsworth
unpretending
muse
in
russet
guise
scales
the
summits
of
reflection
while
it
makes
the
round
earth
its
footstool
and
its
home
possibly
a
good
deal
of
this
may
be
regarded
as
the
effect
of
disappointed
views
and
an
inverted
ambition
prevented
by
native
pride
and
indolence
from
climbing
the
ascent
of
learning
or
greatness
taught
by
political
opinions
to
say
to
the
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
the
world
i
hate
ye
seeing
the
path
of
classical
and
artificial
poetry
blocked
up
by
the
cumbrous
ornaments
of
style
and
turgid
so
that
nothing
more
could
be
achieved
in
that
direction
but
by
the
most
ridiculous
bombast
or
the
tamest
servility
he
has
turned
back
partly
from
the
bias
of
his
mind
partly
perhaps
from
a
judicious
policy
has
struck
into
the
sequestered
vale
of
humble
life
sought
out
the
muse
among
and
hamlets
and
the
peasant
has
discarded
all
the
tinsel
pageantry
of
verse
and
endeavoured
not
in
vain
to
aggrandise
the
trivial
and
add
the
charm
of
novelty
to
the
familiar
no
one
has
shewn
the
same
imagination
in
raising
trifles
into
importance
no
one
has
displayed
the
same
pathos
in
treating
of
the
simplest
feelings
of
the
heart
reserved
yet
haughty
having
no
unruly
or
violent
passions
or
those
passions
having
been
early
suppressed
wordsworth
has
passed
his
life
in
solitary
musing
or
in
daily
converse
with
the
face
of
nature
he
exemplifies
in
an
eminent
degree
the
power
of
for
his
poetry
has
no
other
source
or
character
he
has
dwelt
among
pastoral
scenes
till
each
object
has
become
connected
with
a
thousand
feelings
a
link
in
the
chain
of
thought
a
fibre
of
his
own
heart
every
one
is
by
habit
and
familiarity
strongly
attached
to
the
place
of
his
birth
or
to
objects
that
recal
the
most
pleasing
and
eventful
circumstances
of
his
life
but
to
the
author
of
the
nature
is
a
kind
of
home
and
he
may
be
said
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
universe
there
is
no
image
so
insignificant
that
it
has
not
in
some
mood
or
other
found
the
way
into
his
heart
no
sound
that
does
not
awaken
the
memory
of
other
to
him
the
meanest
flower
that
blows
can
give
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
the
daisy
looks
up
to
him
with
sparkling
eye
as
an
old
acquaintance
the
cuckoo
haunts
him
with
sounds
of
early
youth
not
to
be
expressed
a
linnet
nest
startles
him
with
boyish
delight
an
old
withered
thorn
is
weighed
down
with
a
heap
of
recollections
a
grey
cloak
seen
on
some
wild
moor
torn
by
the
wind
or
drenched
in
the
rain
afterwards
becomes
an
object
of
imagination
to
him
even
the
lichens
on
the
rock
have
a
life
and
being
in
his
thoughts
he
has
described
all
these
objects
in
a
way
and
with
an
intensity
of
feeling
that
no
one
else
had
done
before
him
and
has
given
a
new
view
or
aspect
of
nature
he
is
in
this
sense
the
most
original
poet
now
living
and
the
one
whose
writings
could
the
least
be
spared
for
they
have
no
substitute
elsewhere
the
vulgar
do
not
read
them
the
learned
who
see
all
things
through
books
do
not
understand
them
the
great
despise
the
fashionable
may
ridicule
them
but
the
author
has
created
himself
an
interest
in
the
heart
of
the
retired
and
lonely
student
of
nature
which
can
never
die
persons
of
this
class
will
still
continue
to
feel
what
he
has
felt
he
has
expressed
what
they
might
in
vain
wish
to
express
except
with
glistening
eye
and
faultering
tongue
there
is
a
lofty
philosophic
tone
a
thoughtful
humanity
infused
into
his
pastoral
vein
remote
from
the
passions
and
events
of
the
great
world
he
has
communicated
interest
and
dignity
to
the
primal
movements
of
the
heart
of
man
and
ingrafted
his
own
conscious
reflections
on
the
casual
thoughts
of
hinds
and
shepherds
nursed
amidst
the
grandeur
of
mountain
scenery
he
has
stooped
to
have
a
nearer
view
of
the
daisy
under
his
feet
or
plucked
a
branch
of
from
the
spray
but
in
describing
it
his
mind
seems
imbued
with
the
majesty
and
solemnity
of
the
objects
around
him
the
tall
rock
lifts
its
head
in
the
erectness
of
his
spirit
the
cataract
roars
in
the
sound
of
his
verse
and
in
its
dim
and
mysterious
meaning
the
mists
seem
to
gather
in
the
hollows
of
helvellyn
and
the
forked
skiddaw
hovers
in
the
distance
there
is
little
mention
of
mountainous
scenery
in
wordsworth
poetry
but
by
internal
evidence
one
might
be
almost
sure
that
it
was
written
in
a
mountainous
country
from
its
bareness
its
simplicity
its
loftiness
and
its
depth
his
later
philosophic
productions
have
a
somewhat
different
character
they
are
a
departure
from
a
dereliction
of
his
first
principles
they
are
classical
and
courtly
they
are
polished
in
style
without
being
gaudy
dignified
in
subject
without
affectation
they
seem
to
have
been
composed
not
in
a
cottage
at
grasmere
but
among
the
groves
and
stately
recollections
of
we
might
allude
in
particular
for
examples
of
what
we
mean
to
the
lines
on
a
picture
by
claude
lorraine
and
to
the
exquisite
poem
entitled
the
last
of
these
breathes
the
pure
spirit
of
the
finest
fragments
of
antiquity
the
sweetness
the
gravity
the
strength
the
beauty
and
the
langour
of
death
calm
contemplation
and
majestic
pains
its
glossy
brilliancy
arises
from
the
perfection
of
the
finishing
like
that
of
careful
sculpture
not
from
gaudy
colouring
the
texture
of
the
thoughts
has
the
smoothness
and
solidity
of
marble
it
is
a
poem
that
might
be
read
aloud
in
elysium
and
the
spirits
of
departed
heroes
and
sages
would
gather
round
to
listen
to
it
wordsworth
philosophic
poetry
with
a
less
glowing
aspect
and
less
tumult
in
the
veins
than
lord
byron
on
similar
occasions
bends
a
calmer
and
keener
eye
on
mortality
the
impression
if
less
vivid
is
more
pleasing
and
permanent
and
we
confess
it
perhaps
it
is
a
want
of
taste
and
proper
feeling
that
there
are
lines
and
poems
of
our
author
that
we
think
of
ten
times
for
once
that
we
recur
to
any
of
lord
byron
or
if
there
are
any
of
the
latter
writings
that
we
can
dwell
upon
in
the
same
way
that
is
as
lasting
and
sentiments
it
is
when
laying
aside
his
usual
pomp
and
pretension
he
descends
with
wordsworth
to
the
common
ground
of
a
disinterested
humanity
it
may
be
considered
as
characteristic
of
our
poet
writings
that
they
either
make
no
impression
on
the
mind
at
all
seem
mere
or
that
they
leave
a
mark
behind
them
that
never
wears
out
they
either
fall
blunted
from
the
indurated
breast
without
any
perceptible
result
or
they
absorb
it
like
a
passion
to
one
class
of
readers
he
appears
sublime
to
another
and
we
fear
the
largest
ridiculous
he
has
probably
realised
milton
wish
and
fit
audience
found
though
few
but
we
suspect
he
is
not
reconciled
to
the
alternative
there
are
delightful
passages
in
the
excursion
both
of
natural
description
and
of
inspired
reflection
passages
of
the
latter
kind
that
in
the
sound
of
the
thoughts
and
of
the
swelling
language
resemble
heavenly
symphonies
mournful
over
the
grave
of
human
hopes
but
we
must
add
in
justice
and
in
sincerity
that
we
think
it
impossible
that
this
work
should
ever
become
popular
even
in
the
same
degree
as
the
it
affects
a
system
without
having
any
intelligible
clue
to
one
and
instead
of
unfolding
a
principle
in
various
and
striking
lights
repeats
the
same
conclusions
till
they
become
flat
and
insipid
wordsworth
mind
is
obtuse
except
as
it
is
the
organ
and
the
receptacle
of
accumulated
feelings
it
is
not
analytic
but
synthetic
it
is
reflecting
rather
than
theoretical
the
excursion
we
believe
fell
stillborn
from
the
press
there
was
something
abortive
and
clumsy
and
in
the
attempt
it
was
long
and
laboured
the
personages
for
the
most
part
were
low
the
fare
rustic
the
plan
raised
expectations
which
were
not
fulfilled
and
the
effect
was
like
being
ushered
into
a
stately
hall
and
invited
to
sit
down
to
a
splendid
banquet
in
the
company
of
clowns
and
with
nothing
but
successive
courses
of
served
up
it
was
not
even
wordsworth
in
his
person
is
above
the
middle
size
with
marked
features
and
an
air
somewhat
stately
and
quixotic
he
reminds
one
of
some
of
holbein
heads
grave
saturnine
with
a
slight
indication
of
sly
humour
kept
under
by
the
manners
of
the
age
or
by
the
pretensions
of
the
person
he
has
a
peculiar
sweetness
in
his
smile
and
great
depth
and
manliness
and
a
rugged
harmony
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
his
manner
of
reading
his
own
poetry
is
particularly
imposing
and
in
his
favourite
passages
his
eye
beams
with
preternatural
lustre
and
the
meaning
labours
slowly
up
from
his
swelling
breast
no
one
who
has
seen
him
at
these
moments
could
go
away
with
an
impression
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
mark
or
likelihood
perhaps
the
comment
of
his
face
and
voice
is
necessary
to
convey
a
full
idea
of
his
poetry
his
language
may
not
be
intelligible
but
his
manner
is
not
to
be
mistaken
it
is
clear
that
he
is
either
mad
or
inspired
in
company
even
in
a
wordsworth
is
often
silent
indolent
and
reserved
if
he
is
become
verbose
and
oracular
of
late
years
he
was
not
so
in
his
better
days
he
threw
out
a
bold
or
an
indifferent
remark
without
either
effort
or
pretension
and
relapsed
into
musing
again
he
shone
most
because
he
seemed
most
roused
and
animated
in
reciting
his
own
poetry
or
in
talking
about
it
he
sometimes
gave
striking
views
of
his
feelings
and
trains
of
association
in
composing
certain
passages
or
if
one
did
not
always
understand
his
distinctions
still
there
was
no
want
of
interest
there
was
a
latent
meaning
worth
inquiring
into
like
a
vein
of
ore
that
one
can
not
exactly
hit
upon
at
the
moment
but
of
which
there
are
sure
indications
his
standard
of
poetry
is
high
and
severe
almost
to
exclusiveness
he
admits
of
nothing
below
scarcely
of
any
thing
above
himself
it
is
fine
to
hear
him
talk
of
the
way
in
which
certain
subjects
should
have
been
treated
by
eminent
poets
according
to
his
notions
of
the
art
thus
he
finds
fault
with
dryden
description
of
bacchus
in
the
as
if
he
were
a
mere
youth
or
boon
companion
flushed
with
a
purple
grace
he
shews
his
honest
face
instead
of
representing
the
god
returning
from
the
conquest
of
india
crowned
with
and
drawn
by
panthers
and
followed
by
troops
of
satyrs
of
wild
men
and
animals
that
he
had
tamed
you
would
thank
in
hearing
him
speak
on
this
subject
that
you
saw
titian
picture
of
the
meeting
of
and
so
classic
were
his
conceptions
so
glowing
his
style
milton
is
his
great
idol
and
he
sometimes
dares
to
compare
himself
with
him
his
sonnets
indeed
have
something
of
the
same
tone
and
prophetic
spirit
chaucer
is
another
prime
favourite
of
his
and
he
has
been
at
the
pains
to
modernise
some
of
the
canterbury
tales
those
persons
who
look
upon
wordsworth
as
a
merely
puerile
writer
must
be
rather
at
a
loss
to
account
for
his
strong
predilection
for
such
geniuses
as
dante
and
michael
angelo
we
do
not
think
our
author
has
any
very
cordial
sympathy
with
shakespear
how
should
he
shakespear
was
the
least
of
an
egotist
of
any
body
in
the
world
he
does
not
much
relish
the
variety
and
scope
of
dramatic
composition
he
hates
those
interlocutions
between
lucius
and
caius
yet
wordsworth
himself
wrote
a
tragedy
when
he
was
young
and
we
have
heard
the
following
energetic
lines
quoted
from
it
as
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
person
smit
with
remorse
for
some
rash
crime
action
is
momentary
the
motion
of
a
muscle
this
way
or
that
suffering
is
long
obscure
and
infinite
perhaps
for
want
of
light
and
shade
and
the
unshackled
spirit
of
the
drama
this
performance
was
never
brought
forward
our
critic
has
a
great
dislike
to
gray
and
a
fondness
for
thomson
and
collins
it
is
mortifying
to
hear
him
speak
of
pope
and
dryden
whom
because
they
have
been
supposed
to
have
all
the
possible
excellences
of
poetry
he
will
allow
to
have
none
nothing
however
can
be
fairer
or
more
amusing
than
the
way
in
which
he
sometimes
exposes
the
unmeaning
verbiage
of
modern
poetry
thus
in
the
beginning
of
johnson
of
human
let
observation
with
extensive
view
survey
mankind
from
china
to
peru
he
says
there
is
a
total
want
of
imagination
accompanying
the
words
the
same
idea
is
repeated
three
times
under
the
disguise
of
a
different
phraseology
it
comes
to
this
let
with
extensive
mankind
or
take
away
the
first
line
and
the
second
survey
mankind
from
china
to
peru
literally
conveys
the
whole
wordsworth
is
we
must
say
a
perfect
drawcansir
as
to
prose
writers
he
complains
of
the
dry
reasoners
and
people
for
their
want
of
and
he
is
jealous
of
the
rhetorical
declaimers
and
rhapsodists
as
trenching
on
the
province
of
poetry
he
condemns
all
french
writers
as
well
of
poetry
as
prose
in
the
lump
his
list
in
this
way
is
indeed
small
he
approves
of
walton
angler
paley
and
some
other
writers
of
an
inoffensive
modesty
of
pretension
he
also
likes
books
of
voyages
and
travels
and
robinson
crusoe
in
art
he
greatly
esteems
bewick
and
sylvan
etchings
but
he
sometimes
takes
a
higher
tone
and
gives
his
mind
fair
play
we
have
known
him
enlarge
with
a
noble
intelligence
and
enthusiasm
on
nicolas
poussin
fine
pointing
out
the
unity
of
design
that
pervades
them
the
superintending
mind
the
imaginative
principle
that
brings
all
to
bear
on
the
same
end
and
declaring
he
would
not
give
a
rush
for
any
landscape
that
did
not
express
the
time
of
day
the
climate
the
period
of
the
world
it
was
meant
to
illustrate
or
had
not
this
character
of
in
it
his
eye
also
does
justice
to
rembrandt
fine
and
masterly
effects
in
the
way
in
which
that
artist
works
something
out
of
nothing
and
transforms
the
stump
of
a
tree
a
common
figure
into
an
object
by
the
gorgeous
light
and
shade
thrown
upon
it
he
perceives
an
analogy
to
his
own
mode
of
investing
the
minute
details
of
nature
with
an
atmosphere
of
sentiment
and
in
pronouncing
rembrandt
to
be
a
man
of
genius
feels
that
he
strengthens
his
own
claim
to
the
title
it
has
been
said
of
wordsworth
that
he
hates
conchology
that
he
hates
the
venus
of
medicis
but
these
we
hope
are
mere
epigrams
and
as
far
from
truth
as
they
are
free
from
malice
a
sort
of
running
satire
or
critical
clenches
where
one
for
sense
and
one
for
rhyme
is
quite
sufficient
at
one
time
we
think
however
that
if
wordsworth
had
been
a
more
liberal
and
candid
critic
he
would
have
been
a
more
sterling
writer
if
a
greater
number
of
sources
of
pleasure
had
been
open
to
him
he
would
have
communicated
pleasure
to
the
world
more
frequently
had
he
been
less
fastidious
in
pronouncing
sentence
on
the
works
of
others
his
own
would
have
been
received
more
favourably
and
treated
more
leniently
the
current
of
his
feelings
is
deep
but
narrow
the
range
of
his
understanding
is
lofty
and
aspiring
rather
than
discursive
the
force
the
originality
the
absolute
truth
and
identity
with
which
he
feels
some
things
makes
him
indifferent
to
so
many
others
the
simplicity
and
enthusiasm
of
his
feelings
with
respect
to
nature
renders
him
bigotted
and
intolerant
in
his
judgments
of
men
and
things
but
it
happens
to
him
as
to
others
that
his
strength
lies
in
his
weakness
and
perhaps
we
have
no
right
to
complain
we
might
get
rid
of
the
cynic
and
the
egotist
and
find
in
his
stead
a
man
we
should
take
the
good
the
gods
provide
us
a
fine
and
original
vein
of
poetry
is
not
one
of
their
most
contemptible
gifts
and
the
rest
is
scarcely
worth
thinking
of
except
as
it
may
be
a
mortification
to
those
who
expect
perfection
from
human
nature
or
who
have
been
idle
enough
at
some
period
of
their
lives
to
deify
men
of
genius
as
possessing
claims
above
it
but
this
is
a
chord
that
jars
and
we
shall
not
dwell
upon
it
lord
byron
we
have
called
according
to
the
old
proverb
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune
wordsworth
might
plead
in
mitigation
of
some
peculiarities
that
he
is
the
spoiled
child
of
disappointment
we
are
convinced
if
he
had
been
early
a
popular
poet
he
would
have
borne
his
honours
meekly
and
would
have
been
a
person
of
great
and
frankness
of
disposition
but
the
sense
of
injustice
and
of
undeserved
ridicule
sours
the
temper
and
narrows
the
views
to
have
produced
works
of
genius
and
to
find
them
neglected
or
treated
with
scorn
is
one
of
the
heaviest
trials
of
human
patience
we
exaggerate
our
own
merits
when
they
are
denied
by
others
and
are
apt
to
grudge
and
cavil
at
every
particle
of
praise
bestowed
on
those
to
whom
we
feel
a
conscious
superiority
in
mere
we
turn
against
the
world
when
it
turns
against
us
brood
over
the
undeserved
slights
we
receive
and
thus
the
genial
current
of
the
soul
is
stopped
or
vents
itself
in
effusions
of
petulance
and
wordsworth
has
thought
too
much
of
contemporary
critics
and
criticism
and
less
than
he
ought
of
the
award
of
posterity
and
of
the
opinion
we
do
not
say
of
private
friends
but
of
those
who
were
made
so
by
their
admiration
of
his
genius
he
did
not
court
popularity
by
a
conformity
to
established
models
and
he
ought
not
to
have
been
surprised
that
his
originality
was
not
understood
as
a
matter
of
course
he
has
too
much
on
the
and
has
often
thrown
out
crusts
to
the
critics
in
mere
defiance
or
as
a
point
of
honour
when
he
was
challenged
which
otherwise
his
own
good
sense
would
have
withheld
we
suspect
that
wordsworth
feelings
are
a
little
morbid
in
this
respect
or
that
he
resents
censure
more
than
he
is
gratified
by
praise
otherwise
the
tide
has
turned
much
in
his
favour
of
late
years
he
has
a
large
body
of
determined
partisans
and
is
at
present
sufficiently
in
request
with
the
public
to
save
or
relieve
him
from
the
last
necessity
to
which
a
man
of
genius
can
be
reduced
that
of
becoming
the
god
of
his
own
idolatry
malthus
malthus
may
be
considered
as
one
of
those
rare
and
fortunate
writers
who
have
attained
a
reputation
in
questions
of
moral
and
political
philosophy
his
name
undoubtedly
stands
very
high
in
the
present
age
and
will
in
all
probability
go
down
to
posterity
with
more
or
less
of
renown
or
obloquy
it
was
said
by
a
person
well
qualified
to
judge
both
from
strength
and
candour
of
mind
that
it
would
take
a
thousand
years
at
least
to
answer
his
work
on
population
he
has
certainly
thrown
a
new
light
on
that
question
and
changed
the
aspect
of
political
economy
in
a
decided
and
material
point
of
view
whether
he
has
not
also
endeavoured
to
spread
a
gloom
over
the
hopes
and
more
sanguine
speculations
of
man
and
to
cast
a
slur
upon
the
face
of
nature
is
another
question
there
is
this
to
be
said
for
malthus
that
in
speaking
of
him
one
knows
what
one
is
talking
about
he
is
something
beyond
a
mere
name
one
has
not
to
the
about
his
talents
his
attainments
his
vast
reputation
and
leave
off
without
knowing
what
it
all
amounts
to
he
is
not
one
of
those
great
men
who
set
themselves
off
and
strut
and
fret
an
hour
upon
the
stage
during
a
of
popularity
with
the
ornaments
and
jewels
borrowed
from
the
common
stock
to
which
nothing
but
their
vanity
and
presumption
gives
them
the
least
individual
claim
he
has
dug
into
the
mine
of
truth
and
brought
up
ore
mixed
with
dross
in
weighing
his
merits
we
come
at
once
to
the
question
of
what
he
has
done
or
failed
to
do
it
is
a
specific
claim
that
he
sets
up
when
we
speak
of
malthus
we
mean
the
on
and
when
we
mention
the
essay
on
population
we
mean
a
distinct
leading
proposition
that
stands
out
intelligibly
from
all
trashy
pretence
and
is
a
ground
on
which
to
fix
the
levers
that
may
move
the
world
backwards
or
forwards
he
has
not
left
opinion
where
he
found
it
he
has
advanced
or
given
it
a
wrong
bias
or
thrown
a
in
its
way
in
a
word
his
name
is
not
stuck
like
so
many
others
in
the
firmament
of
reputation
nobody
knows
why
inscribed
in
great
letters
and
with
a
transparency
of
talents
genius
learning
blazing
round
it
it
is
tantamount
to
an
idea
it
is
identified
with
a
principle
it
means
that
population
can
not
go
on
perpetually
increasing
without
pressing
on
the
limits
of
the
means
of
subsistence
and
that
a
check
of
some
kind
or
other
must
sooner
or
later
be
opposed
to
this
is
the
essence
of
the
doctrine
which
malthus
has
been
the
first
to
bring
into
general
notice
and
as
we
think
to
establish
beyond
the
fear
of
contradiction
admitting
then
as
we
do
the
prominence
and
the
value
of
his
claims
to
public
attention
it
yet
remains
a
question
how
far
those
claims
are
as
to
the
talent
displayed
in
them
strictly
original
how
far
as
to
the
logical
accuracy
with
which
he
has
treated
the
subject
he
has
introduced
foreign
and
doubtful
matter
into
it
and
how
far
as
to
the
spirit
in
which
he
has
conducted
his
inquiries
and
applied
a
general
principle
to
particular
objects
he
has
only
drawn
fair
and
inevitable
conclusions
from
it
or
endeavoured
to
tamper
with
and
wrest
it
to
sinister
and
servile
purposes
a
writer
who
shrinks
from
following
up
a
principle
into
its
untoward
consequences
from
timidity
or
false
delicacy
is
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
a
philosopher
a
writer
who
assumes
the
garb
of
candour
and
an
inflexible
love
of
truth
to
garble
and
pervert
it
to
crouch
to
power
and
pander
to
prejudice
deserves
a
worse
title
than
that
of
a
sophist
malthus
first
octavo
volume
on
this
subject
published
in
the
year
was
intended
as
an
answer
to
godwin
concerning
political
it
was
well
got
up
for
the
purpose
and
had
an
immediate
effect
it
was
what
in
the
language
of
the
ring
is
called
it
made
godwin
and
the
other
advocates
of
modern
philosophy
look
about
them
it
may
be
almost
doubted
whether
malthus
was
in
the
first
instance
serious
in
many
things
that
he
threw
out
or
whether
he
did
not
hazard
the
whole
as
an
amusing
and
extreme
paradox
which
might
puzzle
the
reader
as
it
had
done
himself
in
an
idle
moment
but
to
which
no
practical
consequence
whatever
could
attach
this
state
of
mind
would
probably
continue
till
the
irritation
of
enemies
and
the
encouragement
of
friends
convinced
him
that
what
he
had
at
first
exhibited
as
an
idle
fancy
was
in
fact
a
very
valuable
discovery
or
like
the
toad
ugly
and
venomous
had
yet
a
precious
jewel
in
its
head
such
a
supposition
would
at
least
account
for
some
things
in
the
original
essay
which
scarcely
any
writer
would
venture
upon
except
as
professed
exercises
of
ingenuity
and
which
have
been
since
in
part
retracted
but
a
wrong
bias
was
thus
given
and
the
author
theory
was
thus
rendered
warped
disjointed
and
sophistical
from
the
very
outset
nothing
could
in
fact
be
more
illogical
not
to
say
absurd
than
the
whole
of
malthus
reasoning
applied
as
an
answer
to
godwin
book
or
to
the
theories
of
other
utopian
philosophers
godwin
was
not
singular
but
was
kept
in
countenance
by
many
authorities
both
ancient
and
modern
in
supposing
a
state
of
society
possible
in
which
the
passions
and
wills
of
individuals
would
be
conformed
to
the
general
good
in
which
the
knowledge
of
the
best
means
of
promoting
human
welfare
and
the
desire
of
contributing
to
it
would
banish
vice
and
misery
from
the
world
and
in
which
the
of
ignorance
of
selfishness
and
the
indulgence
of
gross
appetite
being
removed
all
things
would
move
on
by
the
mere
impulse
of
wisdom
and
virtue
to
still
higher
and
higher
degrees
of
perfection
and
happiness
compared
with
the
lamentable
and
gross
deficiencies
of
existing
institutions
such
a
view
of
futurity
as
barely
possible
could
not
fail
to
allure
the
gaze
and
tempt
the
aspiring
thoughts
of
the
philanthropist
and
the
philosopher
the
hopes
and
the
imaginations
of
speculative
men
could
not
but
rush
forward
into
this
ideal
world
as
into
a
of
good
and
from
the
mighty
stream
of
tendency
as
wordsworth
in
the
cant
of
the
day
calls
it
there
was
danger
that
the
proud
monuments
of
institutions
that
the
of
power
and
corruption
that
the
corinthian
capitals
of
polished
society
with
the
base
and
pediments
might
be
overthrown
and
swept
away
as
by
a
hurricane
there
were
not
wanting
persons
whose
ignorance
whose
fears
whose
pride
or
whose
prejudices
contemplated
such
an
alternative
with
horror
and
who
would
naturally
feel
no
small
obligation
to
the
man
who
should
relieve
their
apprehensions
from
the
stunning
roar
of
this
mighty
change
of
opinion
that
thundered
at
a
distance
and
should
be
able
by
some
logical
apparatus
or
unexpected
turn
of
the
argument
to
prevent
the
vessel
of
the
state
from
being
hurried
forward
with
the
progress
of
improvement
and
dashed
in
pieces
down
the
tremendous
precipice
of
human
perfectibility
then
comes
malthus
forward
with
the
geometrical
and
arithmetical
ratios
in
his
hands
and
holds
them
out
to
his
affrighted
contemporaries
as
the
only
means
of
salvation
for
so
argued
the
author
of
the
essay
let
the
principles
of
godwin
enquiry
and
of
other
similar
works
be
carried
literally
and
completely
into
effect
let
every
corruption
and
abuse
of
power
be
entirely
got
rid
of
let
virtue
knowledge
and
civilization
be
advanced
to
the
greatest
height
that
these
visionary
reformers
would
suppose
let
the
passions
and
appetites
be
subjected
to
the
utmost
control
of
reason
and
influence
of
public
opinion
grant
them
in
a
word
all
that
they
ask
and
the
more
completely
their
views
are
realized
the
sooner
will
they
be
overthrown
again
and
the
more
inevitable
and
fatal
will
be
the
catastrophe
for
the
principle
of
population
will
still
prevail
and
from
the
comfort
ease
and
plenty
that
will
abound
will
receive
an
increasing
force
and
the
number
of
mouths
to
be
fed
will
have
no
limit
but
the
food
that
is
to
supply
them
can
not
keep
pace
with
the
demand
for
it
we
must
come
to
a
stop
somewhere
even
though
each
square
yard
by
extreme
improvements
in
cultivation
could
maintain
its
man
in
this
state
of
things
there
will
be
no
remedy
the
wholesome
checks
of
vice
and
misery
which
have
hitherto
kept
this
principle
within
bounds
will
have
been
done
away
the
voice
of
reason
will
be
unheard
the
passions
only
will
bear
sway
famine
distress
havoc
and
dismay
will
spread
around
hatred
violence
war
and
bloodshed
will
be
the
infallible
consequence
and
from
the
pinnacle
of
happiness
peace
refinement
and
social
advantage
we
shall
be
hurled
once
more
into
a
profounder
abyss
of
misery
want
and
barbarism
than
ever
by
the
sole
operation
of
the
principle
of
population
such
is
a
brief
abstract
of
the
argument
of
the
essay
can
any
thing
be
less
conclusive
a
more
complete
fallacy
and
malthus
concedes
he
assumes
a
state
of
perfectibility
such
as
his
opponents
imagined
in
which
the
general
good
is
to
obtain
the
entire
mastery
of
individual
interests
and
reason
of
gross
appetites
and
passions
and
then
he
argues
that
such
a
perfect
structure
of
society
will
fall
by
its
own
weight
or
rather
be
undermined
by
the
principle
of
population
because
in
the
highest
possible
state
of
the
subjugation
of
the
passions
to
reason
they
will
be
absolutely
lawless
and
unchecked
and
because
as
men
become
enlightened
quick
sighted
and
they
will
shew
themselves
utterly
blind
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
utterly
indifferent
to
their
own
and
that
of
all
succeeding
generations
whose
fate
is
placed
in
their
hands
this
we
conceive
to
be
the
boldest
paralogism
that
ever
was
offered
to
the
world
or
palmed
upon
willing
credulity
against
whatever
other
scheme
of
reform
this
objection
might
be
valid
the
one
it
was
brought
expressly
to
overturn
was
impregnable
against
it
invulnerable
to
its
slightest
graze
say
that
the
utopian
reasoners
are
visionaries
unfounded
that
the
state
of
virtue
and
knowledge
they
suppose
in
which
reason
shall
have
become
can
never
take
place
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
nature
of
man
and
with
all
experience
well
and
good
but
to
say
that
society
will
have
attained
this
high
and
palmy
state
that
reason
will
have
become
the
key
to
all
our
motives
and
that
when
arrived
at
its
greatest
power
it
will
cease
to
act
at
all
but
will
fall
down
dead
inert
and
senseless
before
the
principle
of
population
is
an
opinion
which
one
would
think
few
people
would
choose
to
advance
or
assent
to
without
strong
inducements
for
maintaining
or
believing
it
the
fact
however
is
that
malthus
found
this
argument
entire
the
principle
and
the
application
of
it
in
an
obscure
and
almost
forgotten
work
published
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
entitled
prospects
of
mankind
nature
and
by
a
scotch
gentleman
of
the
name
of
wallace
the
chapter
in
this
work
on
the
principle
of
population
considered
as
a
bar
to
all
ultimate
views
of
human
improvement
was
probably
written
to
amuse
an
idle
hour
or
read
as
a
paper
to
exercise
the
wits
of
some
literary
society
in
the
northern
capital
and
no
farther
responsibility
or
importance
annexed
to
it
malthus
by
adopting
and
setting
his
name
to
it
has
given
it
sufficient
currency
and
effect
it
sometimes
happens
that
one
writer
is
the
first
to
discover
a
certain
principle
or
lay
down
a
given
observation
and
that
another
makes
an
application
of
or
draws
a
remote
or
an
immediate
inference
from
it
totally
unforeseen
by
the
first
and
from
which
in
all
probability
he
might
have
widely
dissented
but
this
is
not
so
in
the
present
instance
malthus
has
borrowed
perhaps
without
consciousness
at
any
rate
without
acknowledgment
both
the
preliminary
statement
that
the
increase
in
the
supply
of
food
from
a
limited
earth
and
a
limited
fertility
must
have
an
end
while
the
tendency
to
increase
in
the
principle
of
population
has
none
without
some
external
and
forcible
restraint
on
it
and
the
subsequent
use
made
of
this
statement
as
an
insuperable
bar
to
all
schemes
of
utopian
or
progressive
improvement
both
these
he
has
borrowed
whole
from
wallace
with
all
their
imperfections
on
their
heads
and
has
added
more
and
greater
ones
to
them
out
of
his
own
store
in
order
to
produce
something
of
a
startling
and
dramatic
effect
he
has
strained
a
point
or
two
in
order
to
quell
and
frighten
away
the
bugbear
of
modern
philosophy
he
was
obliged
to
make
a
sort
of
monster
of
the
principle
of
population
which
was
brought
into
the
field
against
it
and
which
was
to
swallow
it
up
quick
no
no
middle
course
of
reasoning
would
do
with
a
view
to
meet
the
highest
possible
power
of
reason
in
the
new
order
of
things
malthus
saw
the
necessity
of
giving
the
greatest
possible
physical
weight
to
the
antagonist
principle
and
he
accordingly
lays
it
down
that
its
operation
is
mechanical
and
irresistible
he
premises
these
two
propositions
as
the
basis
of
all
his
reasoning
food
is
necessary
to
the
desire
to
propagate
the
species
is
an
equally
indispensable
law
of
our
thus
making
it
appear
that
these
two
wants
or
impulses
are
equal
and
coordinate
principles
of
action
if
this
double
statement
had
been
true
the
whole
scope
and
structure
of
his
reasoning
as
hostile
to
human
hopes
and
sanguine
speculations
would
have
been
irrefragable
but
as
it
is
not
true
the
whole
in
that
view
falls
to
the
ground
according
to
octavo
edition
the
sexual
passion
is
as
necessary
to
be
gratified
as
the
appetite
of
hunger
and
a
man
can
no
more
exist
without
propagating
his
species
than
he
can
live
without
eating
were
it
so
neither
of
these
passions
would
admit
of
any
excuses
any
delay
any
restraint
from
reason
or
foresight
and
the
only
checks
to
the
principle
of
population
must
be
vice
and
misery
the
argument
would
be
triumphant
and
complete
but
there
is
no
analogy
no
parity
in
the
two
cases
such
as
our
author
here
assumes
no
man
can
live
for
any
length
of
time
without
food
many
persons
live
all
their
lives
without
gratifying
the
other
sense
the
longer
the
craving
after
food
is
unsatisfied
the
more
violent
imperious
and
uncontroulable
the
desire
becomes
whereas
the
longer
the
gratification
of
the
sexual
passion
is
resisted
the
greater
force
does
habit
and
resolution
acquire
over
it
and
generally
speaking
it
is
a
fact
attested
by
all
observation
and
history
that
this
latter
passion
is
subject
more
or
less
to
controul
from
personal
feelings
and
character
from
public
opinions
and
the
institutions
of
society
so
as
to
lead
either
to
a
lawful
and
regulated
indulgence
or
to
partial
or
total
abstinence
according
to
the
dictates
of
which
latter
check
to
the
inordinate
excesses
and
consequences
of
the
principle
of
population
our
author
having
no
longer
an
extreme
case
to
make
out
admits
and
is
willing
to
patronize
in
addition
to
the
two
former
and
exclusive
ones
of
and
in
the
second
and
remaining
editions
of
his
work
malthus
has
shewn
some
awkwardness
or
even
reluctance
in
softening
down
the
harshness
of
his
first
peremptory
decision
he
sometimes
grants
his
grand
exception
cordially
proceeds
to
argue
stoutly
and
to
try
conclusions
upon
it
at
other
times
he
seems
disposed
to
cavil
about
or
retract
it
the
influence
of
moral
restraint
is
very
inconsiderable
or
none
at
all
it
is
indeed
difficult
more
particularly
for
so
formal
and
nice
a
reasoner
as
malthus
to
piece
such
contradictions
plausibly
or
gracefully
together
we
wonder
how
manages
it
how
should
attempt
it
the
whole
question
the
of
the
argument
of
his
early
volume
turned
upon
this
whether
vice
and
misery
were
the
actual
or
possible
checks
to
the
principle
of
population
he
then
said
they
were
and
farewell
to
building
castles
in
the
air
he
now
says
that
is
to
be
coupled
with
these
and
that
its
influence
depends
greatly
on
the
state
of
laws
and
manners
and
utopia
stands
where
it
did
a
great
way
off
indeed
but
not
turned
by
our
magician
wand
should
we
ever
arrive
there
that
is
attain
to
a
state
of
moral
we
shall
not
be
driven
headlong
back
into
epicurus
stye
for
want
of
the
only
possible
checks
to
population
and
and
in
proportion
as
we
advance
that
way
that
is
as
the
influence
of
moral
restraint
is
extended
the
necessity
for
vice
and
misery
will
be
diminished
instead
of
being
increased
according
to
the
first
alarm
given
by
the
essay
again
the
advance
of
civilization
and
of
population
in
consequence
with
the
same
degree
of
moral
restraint
as
there
exists
in
england
at
this
present
time
for
instance
is
a
good
and
not
an
evil
but
this
does
not
appear
from
the
essay
the
essay
shews
that
population
is
not
as
had
been
sometimes
taken
for
granted
an
abstract
and
unqualified
good
but
it
led
many
persons
to
suppose
that
it
was
an
abstract
and
unqualified
evil
to
be
checked
only
by
vice
and
misery
and
producing
according
to
its
encouragement
a
greater
quantity
of
vice
and
misery
and
this
error
the
author
has
not
been
at
sufficient
pains
to
do
away
another
thing
in
which
malthus
attempted
to
wallace
argument
was
in
giving
to
the
disproportionate
power
of
increase
in
the
principle
of
population
and
the
supply
of
food
a
mathematical
form
or
reducing
it
to
the
arithmetical
and
geometrical
ratios
in
which
we
believe
malthus
is
now
generally
admitted
even
by
his
friends
and
admirers
to
have
been
wrong
there
is
evidently
no
inherent
difference
in
the
principle
of
increase
in
food
or
population
since
a
grain
of
corn
for
example
will
propagate
and
multiply
itself
much
faster
even
than
the
human
species
a
bushel
of
wheat
will
sow
a
field
that
field
will
furnish
seed
for
twenty
others
so
that
the
limit
to
the
means
of
subsistence
is
only
the
want
of
room
to
raise
it
in
or
as
wallace
expresses
it
a
limited
fertility
and
a
limited
earth
up
to
the
point
where
the
earth
or
any
given
country
is
fully
occupied
or
cultivated
the
means
of
subsistence
naturally
increase
in
a
geometrical
ratio
and
will
more
than
keep
pace
with
the
natural
and
unrestrained
progress
of
population
and
beyond
that
point
they
do
not
go
on
increasing
even
in
arithmetical
ratio
but
are
stationary
or
nearly
so
so
far
then
is
this
proportion
from
being
universally
and
mathematically
true
that
in
no
part
of
the
world
or
state
of
society
does
it
hold
good
but
our
theorist
by
laying
down
this
double
ratio
as
a
law
of
nature
gains
this
advantage
that
at
all
times
it
seems
as
if
whether
in
new
or
countries
in
fertile
or
barren
soils
the
population
was
pressing
hard
on
the
means
of
subsistence
and
again
it
seems
as
if
the
evil
increased
with
the
progress
of
improvement
and
civilization
for
if
you
cast
your
eye
at
the
scale
which
is
supposed
to
be
calculated
upon
true
and
infallible
you
find
that
when
the
population
is
at
the
means
of
subsistence
are
at
so
that
here
there
is
only
a
of
one
half
but
when
it
is
at
they
have
only
got
to
so
that
here
there
is
a
difference
of
in
and
so
on
in
proportion
the
farther
we
proceed
the
more
enormous
is
the
mass
of
vice
and
misery
we
must
undergo
as
a
consequence
of
the
natural
excess
of
the
population
over
the
means
of
subsistence
and
as
a
salutary
check
to
its
farther
desolating
progress
the
mathematical
table
placed
at
the
front
of
the
essay
therefore
leads
to
a
secret
suspicion
or
a
assumption
that
we
ought
in
mere
kindness
and
compassion
to
give
every
sort
of
indirect
and
encouragement
to
say
the
least
to
the
providential
checks
of
vice
and
misery
as
the
sooner
we
arrest
this
formidable
and
paramount
evil
in
its
course
the
less
opportunity
we
leave
it
of
doing
incalculable
mischief
accordingly
whenever
there
is
the
least
talk
of
colonizing
new
countries
of
extending
the
population
or
adding
to
social
comforts
and
improvements
malthus
conjures
up
his
double
ratios
and
insists
on
the
alarming
results
of
advancing
them
a
single
step
forward
in
the
series
by
the
same
rule
it
would
be
better
to
return
at
once
to
a
state
of
barbarism
and
to
take
the
benefit
of
acorns
and
as
a
security
against
the
luxuries
and
wants
of
civilized
life
but
it
is
not
our
ingenious
author
wish
to
hint
at
or
recommend
any
alterations
in
existing
institutions
and
he
is
therefore
silent
on
that
unpalatable
part
of
the
subject
and
natural
inference
from
his
principles
malthus
gospel
is
preached
to
the
poor
he
lectures
them
on
economy
on
morality
the
regulation
of
their
passions
which
he
says
at
other
times
are
amenable
to
no
restraint
and
on
the
ungracious
topic
that
the
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
laws
of
god
have
doomed
them
and
their
families
to
starve
for
want
of
a
right
to
the
smallest
portion
of
food
beyond
what
their
labour
will
supply
or
some
charitable
hand
may
hold
out
in
compassion
this
is
illiberal
and
it
is
not
philosophical
the
laws
of
nature
or
of
god
to
which
the
author
appeals
are
no
other
than
a
limited
fertility
and
a
limited
earth
within
those
bounds
the
rest
is
regulated
by
the
laws
of
man
the
division
of
the
produce
of
the
soil
the
price
of
labour
the
relief
afforded
to
the
poor
are
matters
of
human
arrangement
while
any
charitable
hand
can
extend
relief
it
is
a
proof
that
the
means
of
subsistence
are
not
exhausted
in
themselves
that
the
tables
are
not
full
malthus
says
that
the
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
laws
of
god
have
rendered
that
relief
physically
impossible
and
yet
he
would
abrogate
the
by
an
act
of
the
legislature
in
order
to
take
away
that
relief
which
the
laws
of
god
deny
and
which
the
laws
of
man
afford
we
can
not
think
that
this
view
of
his
subject
which
is
prominent
and
dwelt
on
at
great
length
and
with
much
pertinacity
is
dictated
either
by
rigid
logic
or
melting
charity
a
labouring
man
is
not
allowed
to
knock
down
a
hare
or
a
partridge
that
spoils
his
garden
a
keeps
a
pack
of
hounds
a
lady
of
quality
rides
out
with
a
footman
behind
her
on
two
sleek
horses
we
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
all
this
as
exemplifying
the
spirit
of
the
english
constitution
as
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
or
as
an
artful
distribution
of
light
and
shade
in
the
social
picture
but
if
any
one
insists
at
the
same
time
that
the
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
laws
of
god
have
doomed
the
poor
and
their
families
to
starve
because
the
principle
of
population
has
encroached
upon
and
swallowed
up
the
means
of
subsistence
so
that
not
a
mouthful
of
food
is
left
the
grinding
law
of
for
the
poor
we
beg
leave
to
deny
both
fact
and
inference
and
we
put
it
to
malthus
whether
we
are
not
in
strictness
justified
in
doing
so
we
have
perhaps
said
enough
to
explain
our
feeling
on
the
subject
of
malthus
merits
and
defects
we
think
he
had
the
opportunity
and
the
means
in
his
hands
of
producing
a
great
work
on
the
principle
of
population
but
we
believe
he
has
let
it
slip
from
his
having
an
eye
to
other
things
besides
that
broad
and
unexplored
question
he
wished
not
merely
to
advance
to
the
discovery
of
certain
great
and
valuable
truths
but
at
the
same
time
to
overthrow
certain
unfashionable
paradoxes
by
exaggerated
statements
to
curry
favour
with
existing
prejudices
and
interests
by
garbled
representations
he
has
in
a
word
as
it
appears
to
us
on
a
candid
retrospect
and
without
any
feelings
of
controversial
asperity
rankling
in
our
minds
sunk
the
philosopher
and
the
friend
of
his
species
a
character
to
which
he
might
have
aspired
in
the
sophist
and
the
period
at
which
malthus
came
forward
teemed
with
answers
to
modern
philosophy
with
antidotes
to
liberty
and
humanity
with
abusive
histories
of
the
greek
and
roman
republics
with
fulsome
panegyrics
on
the
roman
emperors
at
the
very
time
when
we
were
reviling
buonaparte
for
his
strides
to
universal
empire
with
the
slime
and
offal
of
desperate
servility
and
we
can
not
but
consider
the
essay
as
one
of
the
poisonous
ingredients
thrown
into
the
cauldron
of
legitimacy
to
make
it
thick
and
slab
our
author
has
indeed
so
far
done
service
to
the
cause
of
truth
that
he
has
counteracted
many
capital
errors
formerly
prevailing
as
to
the
universal
and
indiscriminate
encouragement
of
population
under
all
circumstances
but
he
has
countenanced
opposite
errors
which
if
adopted
in
theory
and
practice
would
be
even
more
mischievous
and
has
left
it
to
future
philosophers
to
follow
up
the
principle
that
some
check
must
be
provided
for
the
unrestrained
progress
of
population
into
a
set
of
wiser
and
more
humane
consequences
godwin
has
lately
attempted
an
answer
to
the
essay
thus
giving
malthus
a
for
his
but
we
think
he
has
judged
ill
in
endeavouring
to
invalidate
the
principle
instead
of
confining
himself
to
point
out
the
misapplication
of
it
there
is
one
argument
introduced
in
this
reply
which
will
perhaps
amuse
the
reader
as
a
sort
of
metaphysical
puzzle
it
has
sometimes
occurred
to
me
whether
malthus
did
not
catch
the
first
hint
of
his
geometrical
ratio
from
a
curious
passage
of
judge
blackstone
on
consanguinity
which
is
as
follows
the
doctrine
of
lineal
consanguinity
is
sufficiently
plain
and
obvious
but
it
is
at
the
first
view
astonishing
to
consider
the
number
of
lineal
ancestors
which
every
man
has
within
no
very
great
number
of
degrees
and
so
many
different
bloods
is
a
man
said
to
contain
in
his
veins
as
he
hath
lineal
ancestors
of
these
he
hath
two
in
the
first
ascending
degree
his
own
parents
he
hath
four
in
the
second
the
parents
of
his
father
and
the
parents
of
his
mother
he
hath
eight
in
the
third
the
parents
of
his
two
grandfathers
and
two
grandmothers
and
by
the
same
rule
of
progression
he
hath
an
hundred
and
in
the
seventh
a
thousand
and
in
the
tenth
and
at
the
twentieth
degree
or
the
distance
of
twenty
generations
every
man
hath
above
a
million
of
ancestors
as
common
arithmetic
will
demonstrate
this
will
seem
surprising
to
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
increasing
power
of
progressive
numbers
but
is
palpably
evident
from
the
following
table
of
a
geometrical
progression
in
which
the
first
term
is
and
the
denominator
also
or
to
speak
more
intelligibly
it
is
evident
for
that
each
of
us
has
two
ancestors
in
the
first
degree
the
number
of
which
is
doubled
at
every
remove
because
each
of
our
ancestors
had
also
two
ancestors
of
his
own
of
this
argument
however
proceeds
godwin
from
judge
blackstone
of
a
geometrical
progression
would
much
more
naturally
apply
to
montesquieu
hypothesis
of
the
depopulation
of
the
world
and
prove
that
the
human
species
is
hastening
fast
to
extinction
than
to
the
purpose
for
which
malthus
has
employed
it
an
ingenious
sophism
might
be
raised
upon
it
to
shew
that
the
race
of
mankind
will
ultimately
terminate
in
unity
malthus
indeed
should
have
reflected
that
it
is
much
more
certain
that
every
man
has
had
ancestors
than
that
he
will
have
posterity
and
that
it
is
still
more
doubtful
whether
he
will
have
posterity
to
twenty
or
to
an
indefinite
number
of
generations
enquiry
concerning
population
malthus
style
is
correct
and
elegant
his
tone
of
controversy
mild
and
gentlemanly
and
the
care
with
which
he
has
brought
his
facts
and
documents
together
deserves
the
highest
praise
he
has
lately
quitted
his
favourite
subject
of
population
and
broke
a
lance
with
ricardo
on
the
question
of
rent
and
value
the
partisans
of
ricardo
who
are
also
the
admirers
of
malthus
say
that
the
usual
sagacity
of
the
latter
has
here
failed
him
and
that
he
has
shewn
himself
to
be
a
very
illogical
writer
to
have
said
this
of
him
formerly
on
another
ground
was
accounted
a
heresy
and
a
piece
of
presumption
not
easily
to
be
forgiven
indeed
malthus
has
always
been
a
sort
of
darling
in
the
public
eye
whom
it
was
unsafe
to
meddle
with
he
has
contrived
to
make
himself
as
many
friends
by
his
attacks
on
the
schemes
of
and
on
the
as
mandeville
formerly
procured
enemies
by
his
attacks
on
and
on
and
among
other
instances
that
we
might
mention
pulteney
the
celebrated
miser
of
whom
burke
said
on
his
having
a
large
estate
left
him
that
now
it
was
to
be
hoped
he
would
up
a
was
so
enamoured
with
the
saving
schemes
and
humane
economy
of
the
essay
that
he
desired
a
friend
to
find
out
the
author
and
offer
him
a
church
living
this
liberal
intention
was
by
design
or
accident
unhappily
frustrated
gifford
gifford
was
originally
bred
to
some
handicraft
he
afterwards
contrived
to
learn
latin
and
was
for
some
time
an
usher
in
a
school
till
he
became
a
tutor
in
a
nobleman
family
the
man
the
pedant
and
the
dependant
on
the
great
contribute
to
form
the
editor
of
the
he
is
admirably
qualified
for
this
situation
which
he
has
held
for
some
years
by
a
happy
combination
of
defects
natural
and
acquired
and
in
the
event
of
his
death
it
will
be
difficult
to
provide
him
a
suitable
successor
gifford
has
no
pretensions
to
be
thought
a
man
of
genius
of
taste
or
even
of
general
knowledge
he
merely
understands
the
mechanical
and
instrumental
part
of
learning
he
is
a
critic
of
the
last
age
when
the
different
editions
of
an
author
or
the
dates
of
his
several
performances
were
all
that
occupied
the
inquiries
of
a
profound
scholar
and
the
spirit
of
the
writer
or
the
beauties
of
his
style
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves
or
exercise
the
fancy
of
the
light
and
superficial
reader
in
studying
an
old
author
he
has
no
notion
of
any
thing
beyond
adjusting
a
point
proposing
a
different
reading
or
correcting
by
the
collation
of
various
copies
an
error
of
the
press
in
appreciating
a
modern
one
if
it
is
an
enemy
the
first
thing
he
thinks
of
is
to
charge
him
with
bad
grammar
he
scans
his
sentences
instead
of
weighing
his
sense
or
if
it
is
a
friend
the
highest
compliment
he
conceives
it
possible
to
pay
him
is
that
his
thoughts
and
expressions
are
moulded
on
some
hackneyed
model
his
standard
of
perfection
is
what
he
himself
now
is
a
person
of
literary
attainments
his
utmost
contempt
is
shewn
by
reducing
any
one
to
what
he
himself
once
was
a
person
without
the
ordinary
advantages
of
education
and
learning
it
is
accordingly
assumed
with
much
complacency
in
his
critical
pages
that
tory
writers
are
classical
and
courtly
as
a
matter
of
course
as
it
is
a
standing
jest
and
evident
truism
that
whigs
and
reformers
must
be
persons
of
low
birth
and
breeding
imputations
from
one
of
which
he
himself
has
narrowly
escaped
and
both
of
which
he
holds
in
suitable
abhorrence
he
stands
over
a
contemporary
performance
with
all
the
and
of
a
country
schoolmaster
tries
it
by
technical
rules
affects
not
to
understand
the
meaning
examines
the
the
spelling
shrugs
up
his
shoulders
and
chuckles
over
a
slip
of
the
pen
and
keeps
a
sharp
for
a
false
concord
and
a
flogging
there
is
nothing
liberal
nothing
humane
in
his
style
of
judging
it
is
altogether
petty
captious
and
literal
the
political
subserviency
adds
the
last
finishing
to
his
ridiculous
pedantry
and
vanity
he
has
all
his
life
been
a
follower
in
the
train
of
wealth
and
power
strives
to
back
his
pretensions
on
parnassus
by
a
place
at
court
and
to
gild
his
reputation
as
a
man
of
letters
by
the
smile
of
greatness
he
thinks
his
works
are
stamped
with
additional
value
by
having
his
name
in
the
he
looks
up
to
the
distinctions
of
rank
and
station
as
he
does
to
those
of
learning
with
the
gross
and
overweening
adulation
of
his
early
origin
all
his
notions
are
low
upstart
servile
he
thinks
it
the
highest
honour
to
a
poet
to
be
patronised
by
a
peer
or
by
some
dowager
of
quality
he
is
prouder
of
a
than
of
a
and
is
only
sure
of
having
established
his
claims
to
respectability
by
having
sacrificed
those
of
independence
he
is
a
retainer
to
the
muses
a
to
learning
a
lacquey
in
the
state
he
believes
that
modern
literature
should
wear
the
fetters
of
classical
antiquity
that
truth
is
to
be
weighed
in
the
scales
of
opinion
and
prejudice
that
power
is
equivalent
to
right
that
genius
is
dependent
on
rules
that
taste
and
refinement
of
language
consist
in
many
persons
suppose
that
gifford
knows
better
than
he
pretends
and
that
he
is
shrewd
artful
and
designing
but
perhaps
it
may
be
nearer
the
mark
to
suppose
that
his
dulness
is
guarantee
for
his
sincerity
or
that
before
he
is
the
tool
of
the
profligacy
of
others
he
is
the
dupe
of
his
own
jaundiced
feelings
and
narrow
hoodwinked
perceptions
destroy
his
fib
or
sophistry
in
vain
the
creature
at
his
dirty
work
again
but
this
is
less
from
choice
or
perversity
than
because
he
can
not
help
it
and
can
do
nothing
else
he
damns
a
beautiful
expression
less
out
of
spite
than
because
he
really
does
not
understand
it
any
novelty
of
thought
or
sentiment
gives
him
a
shock
from
which
he
can
not
recover
for
some
time
and
he
naturally
takes
his
revenge
for
the
alarm
and
uneasiness
occasioned
him
without
referring
to
venal
or
party
motives
he
garbles
an
author
meaning
not
so
much
wilfully
as
because
it
is
a
pain
to
him
to
enlarge
his
microscopic
view
to
take
in
the
context
when
a
particular
sentence
or
passage
has
struck
him
as
quaint
and
out
of
the
way
he
an
author
style
and
picks
out
detached
words
and
phrases
for
cynical
reprobation
simply
because
he
feels
himself
at
home
or
takes
a
pride
and
pleasure
in
this
sort
of
petty
warfare
he
is
tetchy
and
impatient
of
contradiction
sore
with
wounded
pride
angry
at
obvious
faults
more
angry
at
unforeseen
beauties
he
has
the
in
his
understanding
and
from
being
used
to
long
confinement
can
not
bear
the
slightest
jostling
or
irregularity
of
motion
he
may
call
out
with
the
fellow
in
the
i
am
not
stephano
but
a
cramp
he
would
go
back
to
the
standard
of
opinions
style
the
faded
ornaments
and
insipid
formalities
that
came
into
fashion
about
forty
years
ago
flashes
of
thought
flights
of
fancy
idiomatic
expressions
he
sets
down
among
the
signs
of
the
times
the
extraordinary
occurrences
of
the
age
we
live
in
they
are
marks
of
a
restless
and
revolutionary
spirit
they
disturb
his
composure
of
mind
and
threaten
by
implication
the
safety
of
the
state
his
slow
habits
of
reasoning
can
not
keep
up
with
the
whirling
eccentric
motion
the
rapid
perhaps
extravagant
combinations
of
modern
literature
he
has
long
been
stationary
himself
and
is
determined
that
others
shall
remain
so
the
hazarding
a
paradox
is
like
letting
off
a
pistol
close
to
his
ear
he
is
alarmed
and
offended
the
using
an
elliptical
mode
of
expression
such
as
he
did
not
use
to
find
in
guides
to
the
english
tongue
jars
him
like
coming
suddenly
to
a
step
in
a
flight
of
stairs
that
you
were
not
aware
of
he
and
at
all
this
exercises
a
sort
of
interjectional
criticism
on
what
excites
his
spleen
his
envy
or
his
wonder
and
hurls
his
meagre
anathemas
at
all
those
writers
who
are
indifferent
alike
to
his
precepts
and
his
example
gifford
in
short
is
possessed
of
that
sort
of
learning
which
is
likely
to
result
from
an
desire
to
supply
the
want
of
the
first
rudiments
of
education
that
sort
of
wit
which
is
the
offspring
of
or
bodily
pain
that
sort
of
sense
which
arises
from
a
spirit
of
contradiction
and
a
disposition
to
cavil
at
and
dispute
the
opinions
of
others
and
that
sort
of
reputation
which
is
the
consequence
of
bowing
to
established
authority
and
ministerial
influence
he
dedicates
to
some
great
man
and
receives
his
compliments
in
return
he
appeals
to
some
great
name
and
the
of
the
two
universities
look
up
to
him
as
an
oracle
of
wisdom
he
throws
the
weight
of
his
verbal
criticism
and
puny
discoveries
in
reading
into
the
gap
that
is
supposed
to
be
making
in
the
constitution
by
whigs
and
radicals
whom
he
qualifies
without
mercy
as
dunces
and
miscreants
and
so
entitles
himself
to
the
protection
of
church
and
state
the
character
of
his
mind
is
an
utter
want
of
independence
and
magnanimity
in
all
that
he
attempts
he
can
not
go
alone
he
must
have
crutches
a
and
trammels
or
he
is
timid
fretful
and
helpless
as
a
child
he
can
not
conceive
of
any
thing
different
from
what
he
finds
it
and
hates
those
who
pretend
to
a
greater
reach
of
intellect
or
boldness
of
spirit
than
himself
he
inclines
by
a
natural
and
deliberate
bias
to
the
traditional
in
laws
and
government
to
the
orthodox
in
religion
to
the
safe
in
opinion
to
the
trite
in
imagination
to
the
technical
in
style
to
whatever
implies
a
surrender
of
individual
judgment
into
the
hands
of
authority
and
a
subjection
of
individual
feeling
to
mechanic
rules
if
he
finds
any
one
flying
in
the
face
of
these
or

he
is

as
that
a

was
confined
in
newgate
a
short
time
before
it
is
not
a
on
the
part
of

it
is
only
an

subserviency

that
of

who
is
ordered
to
deny
his
master
a
sense
of
propriety
a
knowledge
of
the
world
a
poetical
and
moral
license
such
fellows
such
is
his
cue
from
his
employers
should
at
any
rate
be
kept
out
of
privileged
places
persons
who
have
been
convicted
of
ought
not
to
be
suffered
to
write
poetry
if
the
fact
was
not
exactly
as
it
was
stated
it
was
something
of
the
kind
or
it
to
have
been
so
the
assertion
was
a
pious
fraud
the
public
the
court
the
prince
himself
might
read
the
work
but
for
this
mark
of
opprobrium
set
upon
it
it
was
not
to
be
endured
that
an
insolent
plebeian
should
aspire
to
elegance
taste
fancy
it
was
throwing
down
the
barriers
which
ought
to
separate
the
higher
and
the
lower
classes
the
loyal
and
the
disloyal
the
paraphrase
of
the
story
of
dante
was
therefore
to
perform
quarantine
it
was
to
seem
not
yet
recovered
from
the
gaol
infection
there
was
to
be
a
taint
upon
it
as
there
was
none
in
it
and
all
this
was
performed
by
a
single
slip
of
gifford
pen
we
would
willingly
believe
if
we
could
that
in
this
case
there
was
as
much
weakness
and
prejudice
as
there
was
malice
and
again
we
do
not
think
it
possible
that
under
any
circumstances
the
writer
of
the
to
could
enter
into
the
spirit
or
delicacy
of
keats
poetry
the
fate
of
the
latter
somewhat
resembled
that
of
a
bud
bit
by
an
envious
worm
ere
it
could
spread
its
sweet
leaves
to
the
air
or
dedicate
its
beauty
to
the
sun
keats
ostensible
crime
was
that
he
had
been
praised
in
the
a
greater
and
more
unpardonable
offence
probably
was
that
he
was
a
true
poet
with
all
the
errors
and
beauties
of
youthful
genius
to
answer
for
gifford
was
as
insensible
to
the
one
as
he
was
inexorable
to
the
other
let
the
reader
judge
from
the
two
subjoined
specimens
how
far
the
one
writer
could
ever
without
a
presumption
equalled
only
by
a
want
of
set
himself
in
judgment
on
the
other
out
went
the
taper
as
she
hurried
in
its
little
smoke
in
pallid
moonshine
died
she
closed
the
door
she
panted
all
akin
to
spirits
of
the
air
and
visions
wide
no
utter
syllable
or
woe
betide
but
to
her
heart
her
heart
was
voluble
paining
with
eloquence
her
balmy
side
as
though
a
tongueless
nightingale
should
swell
her
heart
in
vain
and
die
in
her
dell
a
casement
high
and
there
was
all
garlanded
with
carven
of
fruits
and
flowers
and
bunches
of
and
diamonded
with
panes
of
quaint
device
innumerable
of
stains
and
splendid
dyes
as
are
the
wings
and
in
the
midst
thousand
heraldries
and
twilight
saints
and
dim
emblazonings
a
shielded
scutcheon
blush
with
blood
of
queens
and
kings
full
on
this
casement
shone
the
wintry
moon
and
threw
warm
gules
on
madeline
fair
breast
as
down
she
knelt
for
heaven
grace
and
boon
fell
on
her
hands
together
prest
and
on
her
silver
cross
soft
amethyst
and
on
her
hair
a
glory
like
a
saint
she
seem
a
splendid
angel
newly
drest
save
wings
for
heaven
porphyro
grew
faint
she
knelt
so
pure
a
thing
so
free
from
mortal
taint
anon
his
heart
revives
her
vespers
done
of
all
its
wreathed
pearls
her
hair
she
frees
unclasps
her
warmed
jewels
one
by
one
loosens
her
fragrant
boddice
by
degrees
her
rich
attire
creeps
rustling
to
her
knees
like
a
mermaid
in
pensive
awhile
she
dreams
awake
and
sees
in
fancy
fair
agnes
in
her
bed
but
dares
not
look
behind
or
all
the
charm
is
fled
soon
trembling
in
her
soft
and
chilly
nest
in
sort
of
wakeful
swoon
perplex
she
lay
until
the
poppied
warmth
of
sleep
her
soothed
limbs
and
soul
fatigued
away
flown
like
a
thought
until
the
blissfully
haven
both
from
joy
and
pain
clasp
like
a
missal
where
swart
paynims
pray
blinded
alike
from
sunshine
and
from
rain
as
though
a
rose
should
shut
and
be
a
bud
again
eve
of
agnes
with
the
rich
beauties
and
the
dim
obscurities
of
lines
like
these
let
us
contrast
the
verses
addressed
a
tuft
of
early
by
the
fastidious
author
of
the
baviad
and
sweet
flowers
that
from
your
humble
beds
thus
prematurely
dare
to
rise
and
trust
your
unprotected
heads
to
cold
aquarius
watery
skies
retire
retire
tepid
airs
are
not
the
genial
brood
of
may
sun
with
light
malignant
glares
and
flatters
only
to
betray
stern
winter
reign
is
not
yet
past
lo
while
your
buds
prepare
to
blow
on
icy
pinions
comes
the
blast
and
nips
your
root
and
lays
you
low
alas
for
such
ungentle
doom
but
i
will
shield
you
and
supply
a
kindlier
soil
on
which
to
bloom
a
nobler
bed
on
which
to
die
come
then
yet
the
morning
ray
has
drunk
the
dew
that
gems
your
crest
and
drawn
your
balmiest
sweets
away
o
come
and
grace
my
anna
breast
ye
droop
fond
flowers
but
did
ye
know
what
worth
what
goodness
there
reside
your
cups
with
liveliest
tints
would
glow
and
spread
their
leaves
with
conscious
pride
for
there
has
liberal
nature
joined
her
riches
to
the
stores
of
art
and
added
to
the
vigorous
mind
the
soft
the
sympathising
heart
come
then
yet
the
morning
ray
has
drunk
the
dew
that
gems
your
crest
and
drawn
your
balmiest
sweets
away
o
come
and
grace
my
anna
breast
o
i
should
think
fragrant
i
but
hope
with
you
to
a
years
of
anxiety
repaid
by
one
short
hour
of
transport
there
more
blest
than
me
thus
shall
ye
live
your
little
day
and
when
ye
die
sweet
flowers
the
grateful
muse
shall
give
a
verse
the
sorrowing
maid
a
sigh
while
i
alas
no
distant
date
mix
with
the
dust
from
whence
i
came
without
a
friend
to
weep
my
fate
without
a
stone
to
tell
my
name
we
subjoin
one
more
specimen
of
these
wild
strains
b
said
to
be
two
years
after
the
ecce
iterum
crispinus
i
wish
i
was
where
anna
lies
for
i
am
sick
of
lingering
here
and
every
hour
affection
cries
go
and
partake
her
humble
bier
i
wish
i
could
for
when
she
died
i
lost
my
all
and
life
has
since
that
sad
hour
a
dreary
void
a
waste
unlovely
and
unlov
but
who
when
i
am
turn
to
clay
shall
duly
to
her
grave
repair
and
pluck
the
ragged
moss
away
and
weeds
that
have
no
business
there
and
who
with
pious
hand
shall
bring
the
flowers
she
cherish
cold
and
violets
that
unheeded
spring
to
scatter
her
hallow
mould
and
who
while
memory
loves
to
dwell
upon
her
name
for
ever
dear
shall
feel
his
heart
with
passion
swell
and
pour
the
bitter
bitter
tear
i
did
it
and
would
fate
allow
should
visit
still
should
still
deplore
but
health
and
strength
have
left
me
now
but
i
alas
can
weep
no
more
take
then
sweet
maid
this
simple
strain
the
last
i
offer
at
thy
shrine
thy
grave
must
then
undeck
remain
and
all
thy
memory
fade
with
mine
and
can
thy
soft
persuasive
look
that
voice
that
might
with
music
vie
thy
air
that
every
gazer
took
thy
matchless
eloquence
of
eye
thy
spirits
frolicsome
as
good
thy
courage
by
no
ills
dismay
thy
patience
by
no
wrongs
subdued
thy
gay
can
they
fade
perhaps
but
sorrow
dims
my
eye
cold
turf
which
i
no
more
must
view
dear
name
which
i
no
more
must
sigh
a
long
a
last
a
sad
adieu
it
may
be
said
in
extenuation
of
the
low
mechanic
vein
of
these
impoverished
lines
that
they
were
written
at
an
early
age
they
were
the
inspired
production
of
a
youthful
lover
gifford
was
thirty
when
he
wrote
them
keats
died
when
he
was
scarce
twenty
farther
it
may
be
said
that
gifford
hazarded
his
first
poetical
attempts
under
all
the
disadvantages
of
a
neglected
education
but
the
same
circumstance
together
with
a
few
unpruned
redundancies
of
fancy
and
quaintnesses
of
expression
was
made
the
plea
on
which
keats
was
hooted
out
of
the
world
and
his
fine
talents
and
wounded
sensibilities
consigned
to
an
early
grave
in
short
the
treatment
of
this
heedless
candidate
for
poetical
fame
might
serve
as
a
warning
and
was
intended
to
serve
as
a
warning
to
all
unfledged
tyros
how
they
venture
upon
any
such
doubtful
experiments
except
under
the
auspices
of
some
lord
of
the
bedchamber
or
government
aristarchus
and
how
they
imprudently
associate
themselves
with
men
of
mere
popular
talent
or
independence
of
feeling
it
is
the
same
in
prose
works
the
editor
scorns
to
enter
the
lists
of
argument
with
any
proscribed
writer
of
the
opposite
party
he
does
not
refute
but
denounces
him
he
makes
no
concessions
to
an
adversary
lest
they
should
in
some
way
be
turned
against
him
he
only
feels
himself
safe
in
the
fancied
insignificance
of
others
he
only
feels
himself
superior
to
those
whom
he
stigmatizes
as
the
lowest
of
mankind
all
persons
are
without
and
honesty
who
do
not
believe
implicitly
with
him
in
the
immaculateness
of
ministers
and
the
divine
origin
of
kings
thus
he
informed
the
world
that
the
author
of
was
a
person
who
could
not
write
a
sentence
of
common
english
and
could
hardly
spell
his
own
name
because
he
was
not
a
friend
to
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
and
had
the
assurance
to
write
of
shakespears
in
a
style
of
criticism
somewhat
different
from
gifford
he
charged
this
writer
with
imposing
on
the
public
by
a
flowery
style
and
when
the
latter
ventured
to
refer
to
a
work
of
his
called
essay
on
the
principles
of
human
which
has
not
a
single
ornament
in
it
as
a
specimen
of
his
original
studies
and
the
proper
bias
of
his
mind
the
learned
critic
with
a
shrug
of
great
said
it
was
amusing
to
see
this
person
sitting
like
one
of
brouwer
dutch
boors
over
his
gin
and
and
fancying
himself
a
leibnitz
the
question
was
whether
the
subject
of
gifford
censure
had
ever
written
such
a
work
or
not
for
if
he
had
he
had
amused
himself
with
something
besides
gin
and
but
our
editor
by
virtue
of
the
situation
he
holds
is
superior
to
facts
or
arguments
he
is
accountable
neither
to
the
public
nor
to
authors
for
what
he
says
of
them
but
owes
it
to
his
employers
to
prejudice
the
work
and
vilify
the
writer
if
the
latter
is
not
avowedly
ready
to
range
himself
on
the
stronger
the
besides
the
political
and
denunciations
of
suspected
writers
intended
for
the
guidance
of
the
heads
of
families
is
filled
up
with
accounts
of
books
of
voyages
and
travels
for
the
amusement
of
the
younger
branches
the
poetical
department
is
almost
a
sinecure
consisting
of
mere
summary
decisions
and
a
list
of
quotations
croker
is
understood
to
contribute
the
helena
articles
and
the
liberality
canning
the
practical
good
sense
the
jacob
the
modesty
southey
the
consistency
and
the
editor
himself
the
chivalrous
spirit
and
the
attacks
on
lady
morgan
it
is
a
double
crime
and
excites
a
double
portion
of
spleen
in
the
editor
when
female
writers
are
not
advocates
of
passive
obedience
and
this
journal
then
is
a
depository
for
every
species
of
political
sophistry
and
personal
calumny
there
is
no
abuse
or
corruption
that
does
not
there
find
a
jesuitical
palliation
or
a
vindication
there
we
meet
the
slime
of
hypocrisy
the
varnish
of
courts
the
cant
of
pedantry
the
cobwebs
of
the
law
the
iron
hand
of
power
its
object
is
as
mischievous
as
the
means
by
which
it
is
pursued
are
odious
the
intention
is
to
poison
the
sources
of
public
opinion
and
of
individual
fame
to
pervert
literature
from
being
the
natural
ally
of
freedom
and
humanity
into
an
engine
of
priestcraft
and
despotism
and
to
undermine
the
spirit
of
the
english
constitution
and
the
independence
of
the
english
character
the
editor
and
his
friends
systematically
explode
every
principle
of
liberty
laugh
patriotism
and
public
spirit
to
scorn
resent
every
pretence
to
integrity
as
a
piece
of
singularity
or
insolence
and
strike
at
the
root
of
all
free
inquiry
or
discussion
by
running
down
every
writer
as
a
vile
scribbler
and
a
bad
member
of
society
who
is
not
a
hireling
and
a
slave
no
means
are
stuck
at
in
accomplishing
this
laudable
end
strong
in
patronage
they
trample
on
truth
justice
and
decency
they
claim
the
privilege
of
they
keep
as
little
faith
with
the
public
as
with
their
opponents
no
statement
in
the
is
to
be
trusted
there
is
no
fact
that
is
not
misrepresented
in
it
no
quotation
that
is
not
garbled
no
character
that
is
not
slandered
if
it
can
answer
the
purposes
of
a
party
to
do
so
the
weight
of
power
of
wealth
of
rank
is
thrown
into
the
scale
gives
its
impulse
to
the
machine
and
the
whole
is
under
the
guidance
of
gifford
instinctive
genius
of
the
inborn
hatred
of
servility
for
independence
of
dulness
for
talent
of
cunning
and
impudence
for
truth
and
honesty
it
costs
him
no
effort
to
execute
his
disreputable
task
in
being
the
tool
of
a
crooked
policy
he
but
labours
in
his
natural
vocation
he
patches
up
a
rotten
system
as
he
would
supply
the
chasms
in
a
manuscript
from
a
grovelling
incapacity
to
do
any
thing
better
thinks
that
if
a
single
iota
in
the
claims
of
prerogative
and
power
were
lost
the
whole
fabric
of
society
would
fall
upon
his
head
and
crush
him
and
calculates
that
his
best
chance
for
literary
reputation
is
by
one
half
of
the
competitors
as
jacobins
and
levellers
and
securing
the
suffrages
of
the
other
half
in
his
favour
as
a
loyal
subject
and
trusty
partisan
gifford
as
a
satirist
is
violent
and
abrupt
he
takes
obvious
or
physical
defects
and
dwells
upon
them
with
much
labour
and
harshness
of
invective
but
with
very
little
wit
or
spirit
he
expresses
a
great
deal
of
anger
and
contempt
but
you
can
not
tell
very
well
why
except
that
he
seems
to
be
sore
and
out
of
humour
his
satire
is
mere
peevishness
and
spleen
or
something
worse
personal
antipathy
and
rancour
we
are
in
quite
as
much
pain
for
the
writer
as
for
the
object
of
his
resentment
his
address
to
peter
pindar
is
laughable
from
its
outrageousness
he
denounces
him
as
a
wretch
hateful
to
god
and
man
for
some
of
the
most
harmless
and
amusing
trifles
that
ever
were
written
and
the
very
humour
and
pleasantry
of
which
we
suspect
constituted
their
offence
in
the
eyes
of
this
his
attacks
on
robinson
were
unmanly
and
even
those
on
merry
and
the
school
were
much
more
ferocious
than
the
occasion
warranted
a
little
affectation
and
quaintness
of
style
did
not
merit
such
severity
of
castigation
c
as
a
translator
gifford
version
of
the
roman
satirist
is
the
baldest
and
in
parts
the
most
offensive
of
all
others
we
do
not
know
why
he
attempted
it
unless
he
had
got
it
in
his
head
that
he
should
thus
follow
in
the
steps
of
dryden
as
he
had
already
done
in
those
of
pope
in
the
baviad
and
maeviad
as
an
editor
of
old
authors
gifford
is
entitled
to
considerable
praise
for
the
pains
he
has
taken
in
revising
the
text
and
for
some
improvements
he
has
introduced
into
it
he
had
better
have
spared
the
notes
in
which
though
he
has
detected
the
blunders
of
previous
commentators
he
has
exposed
his
own
and
narrowness
of
feeling
more
as
a
critic
he
has
thrown
no
light
on
the
character
and
spirit
of
his
authors
he
has
shewn
no
striking
power
of
analysis
nor
of
original
illustration
though
he
has
chosen
to
exercise
his
pen
on
writers
most
congenial
to
his
own
turn
of
mind
from
their
dry
and
caustic
vein
massinger
and
ben
jonson
what
he
will
make
of
marlowe
it
is
difficult
to
guess
he
has
none
of
the
fiery
quality
of
the
poet
gifford
does
not
take
for
his
motto
on
these
occasions
precipitandus
est
his
most
successful
efforts
in
this
way
are
barely
respectable
in
general
his
observations
are
petty
and
discover
as
little
as
they
do
a
habit
of
connected
reasoning
thus
for
instance
in
attempting
to
add
the
name
of
massinger
to
the
list
of
catholic
poets
our
minute
critic
insists
on
the
profusion
of
crucifixes
glories
angelic
visions
garlands
of
roses
and
clouds
of
incense
scattered
through
the
as
evidence
of
the
theological
sentiments
meant
to
be
inculcated
by
the
play
when
the
least
reflection
might
have
taught
him
that
they
proved
nothing
but
the
author
poetical
conception
of
the
character
and
of
his
subject
a
writer
might
with
the
same
sinister
shrewdness
be
accused
of
heathenism
for
talking
of
flora
and
ceres
in
a
poem
on
the
seasons
what
are
produced
as
the
exclusive
badges
and
occult
proofs
of
catholic
bigotry
are
nothing
but
the
adventitious
ornaments
and
external
symbols
the
gross
and
sensible
language
in
a
word
the
of
christianity
in
general
what
indeed
shews
the
frivolousness
of
the
whole
inference
is
that
deckar
who
is
asserted
by
our
critic
to
have
contributed
some
of
the
most
passionate
and
fantastic
of
these
devotional
scenes
is
not
even
suspected
of
a
leaning
to
popery
in
like
manner
he
excuses
massinger
for
the
grossness
of
one
of
his
plots
that
of
the
by
saying
that
it
was
supposed
to
take
place
before
the
christian
era
by
this
shallow
persuading
himself
or
fancying
he
could
persuade
others
that
the
crime
in
question
which
yet
on
the
very
face
of
the
story
is
made
the
ground
of
a
tragic
catastrophe
was
first
made
by
the
christian
religion
the
foregoing
is
a
harsh
criticism
and
may
be
thought
illiberal
but
as
gifford
assumes
a
right
to
say
what
he
pleases
of
others
they
may
be
allowed
to
speak
the
truth
of
him

were

the

the
spirit
was
that

a
field
was
open
to
argument

every

was
tried
upon
its
own
ostensible

there
was
no
foul
play
the
tone
was
that
of
a
studied
impartiality
which
many
called

this
tone
of
impartiality
and
indifference
however
did
not

is
to

and
that
if

can
not
answer
a

arguments
you
may
at

try

we
do
not
implicitly
bow

to
the

we
must
do
justice
to
the

supported

to
the
tone

manly
explicitness
in
which
they
are
delivered

they
are
eminently
characteristic
of
the
spirit
of
the
age

it
is
the
express
object
of
the
to
discountenance
and
extinguish
that
spirit
both
in
theory
and
practice
the
stands
upon
the
ground
of
opinion
it
asserts
the
supremacy
of
intellect
the
it
claims
is
from
an
acknowledged
superiority
of
talent
and
information
and
literary
attainment
and
it
does
not
build
one
tittle
of
its
influence
on
ignorance
or
prejudice
or
authority
or
personal
malevolence
it
takes
up
a
question
and
argues
it
and
with
great
knowledge
and
boldness
and
skill
it
points
out
an
absurdity
and
runs
it
down
fairly
and
according
to
the
evidence
adduced
in
the
former
case
its
conclusions
may
be
wrong
there
may
be
a
bias
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
but
he
states
the
arguments
and
circumstances
on
both
sides
from
which
a
judgment
is
to
be
formed
it
is
not
his
cue
he
has
neither
the
effrontery
nor
the
meanness
to
falsify
facts
or
to
suppress
objections
in
the
latter
case
or
where
a
vein
of
sarcasm
or
irony
is
resorted
to
the
ridicule
is
not
barbed
by
some
allusion
false
or
true
to
private
history
the
object
of
it
has
brought
the
infliction
on
himself
by
some
literary
folly
or
political
delinquency
which
is
referred
to
as
the
understood
and
justifiable
provocation
instead
of
being
held
up
to
scorn
as
a
knave
for
not
being
a
tool
or
as
a
blockhead
for
thinking
for
himself
in
the
the
talents
of
those
on
the
opposite
side
are
always
extolled
in
the
they
are
denied
altogether
and
the
justice
that
is
in
this
way
withheld
from
them
is
compensated
by
a
proportionable
supply
of
personal
abuse
a
man
of
genius
who
is
a
lord
and
who
publishes
with
murray
may
now
and
then
stand
as
good
a
chance
as
a
lord
who
is
not
a
man
of
genius
and
who
publishes
with
longman
but
that
is
the
utmost
extent
of
the
impartiality
of
the
from
its
account
you
would
take
lord
byron
and
stuart
rose
for
two
very
pretty
poets
but

nothing
is
regarded

the

creed

external
circumstances
of
a
writer
in
the
nothing
is
ever
adverted
to
but
his
literary
merits
or
if
there
is
a
bias
of
any
kind
it
arises
from
an
affectation
of
magnanimity
and
candour
in
giving
heaped
measure
to
those
on
the
aristocratic
side
in
politics
and
in
being
critically
severe
on
others
thus
sir
walter
scott
is
lauded
to
the
skies
for
his
romantic
powers
without
any
allusion
to
his
political
demerits
as
if
this
would
be
compromising
the
dignity
of
genius
and
of
criticism
by
the
introduction
of
while
lord
byron
is
called
to
a
grave
moral
reckoning
there
is
however
little
of
the
cant
of
morality
in
the
and
it
is
quite
free
from
that
of
religion
it
keeps
to
its
province
which
is
that
of
criticism
or
to
the
discussion
of
debateable
topics
and
acquits
itself
in
both
with
force
and
spirit
this
is
the
natural
consequence
of
the
composition
of
the
two
reviews
the
one
appeals
with
confidence
to
its
own
intellectual
resources
to
the
variety
of
its
topics
to
its
very
character
and
existence
as
a
literary
journal
which
depend
on
its
setting
up
no
pretensions
but
those
which
it
can
make
good
by
the
talent
and
ingenuity
it
can
bring
to
bear
upon
them
it
therefore
meets
every
question
whether
of
a
lighter
or
a
graver
cast
on
its
own
grounds
the
other
every
question
for
it
has
no
confidence
but
in
powers
that
shuts
itself
up
in
the
impregnable
fastnesses
of
authority
or
makes
some
paltry
cowardly
attack
under
cover
of
anonymous
criticism
on
individuals
or
dispenses
its
award
of
merit
entirely
according
to
the
rank
or
party
of
the
writer
the
faults
of
the
arise
out
of
the
very
consciousness
of
critical
and
logical
power
in
political
questions
it
relies
too
little
on
the
broad
basis
of
liberty
and
humanity
enters
too
much
into
mere
dry
formalities
deals
too
often
in
and
descends
too
readily
to
a
sort
of
in
defence
of
truths
and
natural
feelings
in
matters
of
taste
and
criticism
its
tone
is
sometimes
apt
to
be
supercilious
and
from
its
habitual
faculty
of
analysing
defects
and
beauties
according
to
given
principles
from
its
quickness
in
deciding
from
its
facility
in
illustrating
its
views
in
this
latter
department
it
has
been
guilty
of
some
capital
oversights
the
chief
was
in
its
treatment
of
the
at
their
first
appearance
not
in
its
ridicule
of
their
puerilities
but
in
its
denial
of
their
beauties
because
they
were
included
in
no
school
because
they
were
reducible
to
no
previous
standard
or
theory
of
poetical
excellence
for
this
however
considerable
reparation
has
been
made
by
the
prompt
and
liberal
spirit
that
has
been
shewn
in
bringing
forward
other
examples
of
poetical
genius
its
capital
sin
in
a
doctrinal
point
of
view
has
been
we
shrewdly
suspect
in
the
uniform
and
unqualified
encouragement
it
has
bestowed
on

system
we
do
not
mean
that
the

to
join
in
the
general
and
that
was
raised
against
this
writer
but
while
it
asserted
the
soundness
of
many
of
his
arguments
and
yielded
its
assent
to
the
truths
he
has
divulged
it
need
not
have
screened
his
errors
on
this
subject
alone
we
think
the
has
the
advantage
of
it
but
as
the
is
a
mere
mass
and
tissue
of
prejudices
on
all
subjects
it
is
the
foible
of
the
to
affect
a
somewhat
fastidious
air
of
superiority
over
prejudices
of
all
kinds
and
a
determination
not
to
indulge
in
any
of
the
amiable
weaknesses
of
our
nature
except
as
it
can
give
a
reason
for
the
faith
that
is
in
it
luckily
it
is
seldom
reduced
to
this
alternative
reasons
are
with
it
as
plenty
as
blackberries
jeffrey
is
the
editor
of
the
review
and
is
understood
to
have
contributed
nearly
a
fourth
part
of
the
articles
from
its
commencement
no
man
is
better
qualified
for
this
situation
nor
indeed
so
much
so
he
is
certainly
a
person
in
advance
of
the
age
and
yet
perfectly
fitted
both
from
knowledge
and
habits
of
mind
to
put
a
curb
upon
its
rash
and
headlong
spirit
he
is
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
progress
and
pretensions
of
modern
literature
and
philosophy
and
to
this
he
adds
the
natural
acuteness
and
discrimination
of
the
logician
with
the
habitual
caution
and
coolness
of
his
profession
if
the
may
be
considered
as
the
organ
of
or
at
all
pledged
to
a
party
that
party
is
at
least
a
respectable
one
and
is
placed
in
the
middle
between
two
extremes
the
editor
is
bound
to
lend
a
patient
hearing
to
the
most
paradoxical
opinions
and
extravagant
theories
which
have
resulted
in
our
times
from
the
infinite
agitation
of
wit
but
he
is
disposed
to
qualify
them
by
a
number
of
practical
objections
of
speculative
doubts
of
checks
and
drawbacks
arising
out
of
actual
circumstances
and
prevailing
opinions
or
the
frailties
of
human
nature
he
has
a
great
range
of
knowledge
an
incessant
activity
of
mind
but
the
suspension
of
his
judgment
the
moderation
of
his
sentiments
is
the
consequence
of
the
very
discursiveness
of
his
reason
what
may
be
considered
as
conclusion
is
often
the
result
of
a
comprehensive
view
of
all
the
circumstances
of
a
case
paradox
violence
nay
even
originality
of
conception
is
not
seldom
owing
to
our
dwelling
long
and
pertinaciously
on
some
one
part
of
a
subject
instead
of
attending
to
the
whole
jeffrey
is
neither
a
bigot
nor
an
enthusiast
he
is
not
the
dupe
of
the
prejudices
of
others
nor
of
his
own
he
is
not
wedded
to
any
dogma
he
is
not
long
the
sport
of
any
whim
before
he
can
settle
in
any
fond
or
fantastic
opinion
another
starts
up
to
match
it
like
beads
on
sparkling
wine
a
too
restless
display
of
talent
a
too
undisguised
statement
of
all
that
can
be
said
for
and
against
a
question
is
perhaps
the
great
fault
that
is
to
be
attributed
to
him
where
there
is
so
much
power
and
prejudice
to
contend
with
in
the
opposite
scale
it
may
be
thought
that
the
balance
of
truth
can
hardly
be
held
with
a
slack
or
an
even
hand
and
that
the
infusion
of
a
little
more
visionary
speculation
of
a
little
more
popular
indignation
into
the
great
whig
review
would
be
an
advantage
both
to
itself
and
to
the
cause
of
freedom
much
of
this
effect
is
chargeable
less
on
an
epicurean
levity
of
feeling
or
on
than
on
real
sanguineness
of
disposition
and
a
certain
fineness
of
professional
tact
our
sprightly
scotchman
is
not
of
a
desponding
and
gloomy
turn
of
mind
he
argues
well
for
the
future
hopes
of
mankind
from
the
smallest
beginnings
watches
the
slow
gradual
reluctant
growth
of
liberal
views
and
smiling
sees
the
aloe
of
reform
blossom
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
years
while
the
habitual
subtlety
of
his
mind
makes
him
perceive
decided
advantages
where
vulgar
ignorance
or
passion
sees
only
doubts
and
difficulty
and
a
flaw
in
an
adversary
argument
stands
him
instead
of
the
shout
of
a
mob
the
votes
of
a
majority
or
the
fate
of
a
pitched
battle
the
editor
is
satisfied
with
his
own
conclusions
and
does
not
make
himself
uneasy
about
the
fate
of
mankind
the
issue
he
thinks
will
verify
his
moderate
and
we
believe
also
that
late
events
have
given
a
more
decided
turn
to
jeffrey
mind
and
that
he
feels
that
as
in
the
struggle
between
liberty
and
slavery
the
views
of
the
one
party
have
been
laid
bare
with
their
success
so
the
exertions
on
the
other
side
should
become
more
strenuous
and
a
more
positive
stand
be
made
against
the
avowed
and
appalling
encroachments
of
priestcraft
and
arbitrary
power
the
characteristics
of
jeffrey
general
style
as
a
writer
correspond
we
think
with
what
we
have
here
stated
as
the
characteristics
of
his
mind
he
is
a
master
of
the
foils
he
makes
an
exulting
display
of
the
dazzling
fence
of
wit
and
argument
his
strength
consists
in
great
range
of
knowledge
an
equal
familiarity
with
the
principles
and
the
details
of
a
subject
and
in
a
glancing
brilliancy
and
rapidity
of
style
indeed
we
doubt
whether
the
brilliancy
of
his
manner
does
not
resolve
itself
into
the
rapidity
the
variety
and
aptness
of
his
illustrations
his
pen
is
never
at
a
loss
never
stands
still
and
would
dazzle
for
this
reason
alone
like
an
eye
that
is
ever
in
motion
jeffrey
is
far
from
a
flowery
or
affected
writer
he
has
few
tropes
or
figures
still
less
any
odd
startling
thoughts
or
quaint
innovations
in
expression
but
he
has
a
constant
supply
of
ingenious
solutions
and
pertinent
examples
he
never
proses
never
grows
dull
never
wears
an
argument
to
tatters
and
by
the
number
the
liveliness
and
facility
of
his
transitions
keeps
up
that
appearance
of
vivacity
of
novel
and
sparkling
effect
for
which
others
are
too
often
indebted
to
singularity
of
combination
or
tinsel
ornaments
it
may
be
discovered
by
a
nice
observer
that
jeffrey
style
of
composition
is
that
of
a
person
accustomed
to
public
speaking
there
is
no
pause
no
meagreness
no
inanimateness
but
a
flow
a
redundance
and
volubility
like
that
of
a
stream
or
of
a
the
language
is
more
copious
than
select
and
sometimes
two
or
three
words
perform
the
office
of
one
this
copiousness
and
facility
is
perhaps
an
advantage
in
speaking
where
no
stop
or
break
is
allowed
in
the
discourse
and
where
any
word
or
any
number
of
words
almost
is
better
than
coming
to
a
dead
stand
but
in
written
compositions
it
gives
an
air
of
either
too
much
carelessness
or
too
much
labour
excellence
as
a
public
speaker
has
betrayed
him
into
this
peculiarity
he
makes
fewer
in
addressing
an
audience
than
any
one
we
remember
to
have
heard
there
is
not
a
space
between
any
two
of
his
words
nor
is
there
a
single
expression
either
or
out
of
its
place
he
speaks
without
stopping
to
take
breath
with
ease
with
point
with
elegance
and
without
spinning
the
thread
of
his
verbosity
finer
than
the
staple
of
his
argument
he
may
be
said
to
weave
words
into
any
shapes
he
pleases
for
use
or
ornament
as
the
moulds
the
vitreous
fluid
with
his
breath
and
his
sentences
shine
like
glass
from
their
polished
smoothness
and
are
equally
transparent
his
style
of
eloquence
indeed
is
remarkable
for
neatness
for
correctness
and
epigrammatic
point
and
he
has
applied
this
as
a
standard
to
his
written
compositions
where
the
very
same
degree
of
correctness
and
precision
produces
from
the
contrast
between
writing
and
speaking
an
agreeable
diffuseness
freedom
and
animation
whenever
the
scotch
advocate
has
appeared
at
the
bar
of
the
english
house
of
lords
he
has
been
admired
by
those
who
were
in
the
habit
of
attending
to
speeches
there
as
having
the
greatest
fluency
of
language
and
the
greatest
subtlety
of
distinction
of
any
one
of
the
profession
the
were
as
little
able
to
follow
him
from
the
extreme
rapidity
of
his
utterance
as
from
the
tenuity
and
evanescent
nature
of
his
reasoning
jeffrey
conversation
is
equally
lively
various
and
instructive
there
is
no
subject
on
which
he
is
not
no
company
in
which
he
is
not
ready
to
scatter
his
pearls
for
sport
whether
it
be
politics
or
poetry
or
science
or
anecdote
or
wit
or
raillery
he
takes
up
his
cue
without
effort
without
preparation
and
appears
equally
incapable
of
tiring
himself
or
his
hearers
his
only
difficulty
seems
to
be
not
to
speak
but
to
be
silent
there
is
a
constitutional
buoyancy
and
elasticity
of
mind
about
him
that
can
not
subside
into
repose
much
less
sink
into
dulness
there
may
be
more
original
talkers
persons
who
occasionally
surprise
or
interest
you
more
few
if
any
with
a
more
uninterrupted
flow
of
cheerfulness
and
animal
spirits
with
a
greater
fund
of
information
and
with
fewer
specimens
of
the
in
their
conversation
he
is
never
absurd
nor
has
he
any
favourite
points
which
he
is
always
bringing
forward
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
is
something
bordering
on
petulance
of
manner
but
it
is
of
that
least
offensive
kind
which
may
be
accounted
for
from
merit
and
from
success
and
implies
no
exclusive
pretensions
nor
the
least
particle
of
to
others
on
the
contrary
jeffrey
is
profuse
of
his
encomiums
and
admiration
of
others
but
still
with
a
certain
reservation
of
a
right
to
differ
or
to
blame
he
can
not
rest
on
one
side
of
a
question
he
is
obliged
by
a
mercurial
habit
and
disposition
to
vary
his
point
of
view
if
he
is
ever
tedious
it
is
from
an
excess
of
liveliness
he
oppresses
from
a
sense
of
airy
lightness
he
is
always
setting
out
on
a
fresh
scent
there
are
always
of
topics
the
harness
is
put
to
and
he
rattles
away
as
delightfully
and
as
briskly
as
ever
new
causes
are
called
he
holds
a
brief
in
his
hand
for
every
possible
question
this
is
a
fault
jeffrey
is
not
obtrusive
is
not
impatient
of
opposition
is
not
unwilling
to
be
interrupted
but
what
is
said
by
another
seems
to
make
no
impression
on
him
he
is
bound
to
dispute
to
answer
it
as
if
he
was
in
court
or
as
if
it
were
in
a
paltry
debating
society
where
young
beginners
were
trying
their
hands
this
is
not
to
maintain
a
character
or
for
want
of
it
is
a
thoughtless
habit
he
can
not
help
a
witness
or
stating
the
adverse
view
of
the
question
he
listens
not
to
judge
but
to
reply
in
consequence
of
this
you
can
as
little
tell
the
impression
your
observations
make
on
him
as
what
weight
to
assign
to
his
jeffrey
shines
in
mixed
company
he
is
not
good
in
a
you
can
only
shew
your
wisdom
or
your
wit
in
general
society
but
in
private
your
follies
or
your
weaknesses
are
not
the
least
interesting
topics
and
our
critic
has
neither
any
of
his
own
to
confess
nor
does
he
take
delight
in
hearing
those
of
others
indeed
in
scotland
generally
the
display
of
personal
character
the
indulging
your
whims
and
humours
in
the
presence
of
a
friend
is
not
much
encouraged
every
one
there
is
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
a
machine
or
a
collection
of
topics
they
turn
you
round
like
a
cylinder
to
see
what
use
they
can
make
of
you
and
drag
you
into
a
dispute
with
as
little
ceremony
as
they
would
drag
out
an
article
from
an
encyclopedia
they
criticise
every
thing
analyse
every
thing
argue
upon
every
thing
dogmatise
upon
every
thing
and
the
bundle
of
your
habits
feelings
humours
follies
and
pursuits
is
regarded
by
them
no
more
than
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
they
stop
you
in
a
sentiment
by
a
question
or
a
stare
and
cut
you
short
in
a
narrative
by
the
time
of
night
the
accomplished
and
ingenious
person
of
whom
we
speak
has
been
a
little
infected
by
the
tone
of
his
countrymen
he
is
too
didactic
too
pugnacious
too
full
of
electrical
shocks
too
much
like
a
voltaic
battery
and
reposes
too
little
on
his
own
excellent
good
sense
his
own
love
of
ease
his
cordial
frankness
of
disposition
and
unaffected
candour
he
ought
to
have
belonged
to
us
the
severest
of
critics
as
he
has
been
sometimes
termed
is
the
of
men
whatever
there
may
be
of
wavering
or
indecision
in
jeffrey
reasoning
or
of
harshness
in
his
critical
decisions
in
his
disposition
there
is
nothing
but
simplicity
and
kindness
he
is
a
person
that
no
one
knows
without
esteeming
and
who
both
in
his
public
connections
and
private
friendships
shews
the
same
manly
uprightness
and
unbiassed
independence
of
spirit
at
a
distance
in
his
writings
or
even
in
his
manner
there
may
be
something
to
excite
a
little
uneasiness
and
apprehension
in
his
conduct
there
is
nothing
to
except
against
he
is
a
person
of
strict
integrity
himself
without
pretence
or
affectation
and
knows
how
to
respect
this
quality
in
others
without
prudery
or
intolerance
he
can
censure
a
friend
or
a
stranger
and
serve
him
effectually
at
the
same
time
he
expresses
his
disapprobation
but
not
as
an
excuse
for
closing
up
the
avenues
of
his
liberality
he
is
a
scotchman
without
one
particle
of
hypocrisy
of
cant
of
servility
or
selfishness
in
his
composition
he
has
not
been
spoiled
by
fortune
has
not
been
tempted
by
power
is
firm
without
violence
friendly
without
weakness
a
critic
and
a
casuist
and
an
honest
man
and
amidst
the
toils
of
his
profession
and
the
distractions
of
the
world
retains
the
gaiety
the
unpretending
carelessness
and
simplicity
of
youth
jeffrey
in
his
person
is
slight
with
a
countenance
of
much
expression
and
a
voice
of
great
flexibility
and
acuteness
of
tone
footnote

style

has

there
is

which
has

under
the

title
of
there
is
another
class
which
it
is
not
absolutely
unfair
to
oppose
to
this
and
that
is
the
scotch
the
first
of
these
is
entirely
the
offspring
of
the
last
of
the

as
full
of
fancy
as
it
is

of
facts
the
other
excludes
all
fancy
and
is
weighed
down
with
facts
the
one
is
all
fire
the
other
all
ice

one

but
enthusiasm
extravagance
eccentricity
the
other
nothing
but
logical
deductions

most
approved
postulates

scruple

with
reckless
zeal
throws

reins
loose
on

up
with
a
curbbridle
and
starts
at
every
casual
object
it
meets
in
the
way
as
a
the
genius
of
irish
oratory
stands
forth
in
the
naked
majesty
of
untutored
nature
its
eye
glancing
wildly
round
on
all
objects
its
tongue
darting
forked
fire
the
genius
of
scottish
eloquence
is
armed
in
all
the
panoply
of
the
schools
its
drawling
ambiguous
dialect
seconds
its
circumspect
dialectics
from
behind
the
vizor
that
guards
its
mouth
and
shadows
its
brows
it
sees
no
visions
but
its
own
set
purpose
its
own
and
its
own
dogmas
it
has
no
figures
nor
no
fantasies
but
those
which
busy
care
draws
in
the
brains
of
men
or
which
set
off
its
own
superior
acquirements
and
wisdom
it
scorns
to
tread
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
it
shrinks
back
from
it
as
from
a
precipice
and
keeps
in
the
iron
of
the
understanding
irish
oratory
on
the
contrary
is
a
sort
of
aeronaut
it
is
always
going
up
in
a
balloon
and
breaking
its
neck
or
coming
down
in
the
parachute
it
is
filled
full
with
gaseous
matter
with
whim
and
fancy
with
alliteration
and
antithesis
with
heated
passion
and
bloated
metaphors
that
burst
the
slender
silken
covering
of
sense
and
the
airy
pageant
that
glittered
in
empty
space
and
rose
in
all
the
bliss
of
ignorance
flutters
and
sinks
down
to
its
native
bogs
if
the
irish
orator
riots
in
a
studied
neglect
of
his
subject
and
a
natural
confusion
of
ideas
playing
with
words
ranging
them
into
all
sorts
of
fantastic
combinations
because
in
the
unlettered
void
or
chaos
of
his
mind
there
is
no
obstacle
to
their
coalescing
into
any
shapes
they
please
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
eloquence
of
the
scotch
is
encumbered
with
an
excess
of
knowledge
that
it
can
not
get
on
for
a
crowd
of
difficulties
that
it
staggers
under
a
load
of
topics
that
it
is
so
environed
in
the
forms
of
logic
and
rhetoric
as
to
be
equally
precluded
from
originality
or
absurdity
from
beauty
or
deformity
the
plea
of
humanity
is
lost
by
going
through
the
process
of
law
the
firm
and
manly
tone
of
principle
is
exchanged
for
the
wavering
and
pitiful
cant
of
policy
the
living
bursts
of
passion
are
reduced
to
a
defunct
and
all
true
imagination
is
buried
under
the
dust
and
rubbish
of
learned
models
and
imposing
authorities
if
the
one
is
a
bodiless
phantom
the
other
is
a
lifeless
skeleton
if
the
one
in
its
feverish
and
hectic
extravagance
resembles
a
sick
man
dream
the
other
is
akin
to
the
sleep
of
death
cold
stiff
unfeeling
monumental
upon
the
whole
we
despair
less
of
the
first
than
of
the
last
for
the
principle
of
life
and
motion
is
after
all
the
primary
condition
of
all
genius
the
luxuriant
wildness
of
the
one
may
be
disciplined
and
its
excesses
sobered
down
into
reason
but
the
dry
and
rigid
formality
of
the
other
can
never
burst
the
shell
or
husk
of
oratory
it
is
true
that
the
one
is
disfigured
by
the
puerilities
and
affectation
of
a
phillips
but
then
it
is
redeemed
by
the
manly
sense
and
fervour
of
a
plunket
the
impassioned
appeals
and
flashes
of
wit
of
a
curran
and
by
the
golden
tide
of
wisdom
eloquence
and
fancy
that
flowed
from
the
lips
of
a
burke
in
the
other
we
do
not
sink
so
low
in
the
negative
series
but
we
get
no
higher
in
the
ascending
scale
than
a
mackintosh
or
a
brougham
a
it
may
be
suggested
that
the
late
lord
erskine
enjoyed
a
higher
reputation
as
an
orator
than
either
of
these
but
he
owed
it
to
a
dashing
and
graceful
manner
to
presence
of
mind
and
to
great
animation
in
delivering
his
sentiments
stripped
of
these
outward
and
personal
advantages
the
matter
of
his
speeches
like
that
of
his
writings
is
nothing
or
perfectly
inert
and
dead
brougham
is
from
the
north
of
england
but
he
was
educated
in
edinburgh
and
represents
that
school
of
politics
and
political
economy
in
the
house
he
differs
from
sir
james
mackintosh
in
this
that
he
deals
less
in
abstract
principles
and
more
in
individual
details
he
makes
less
use
of
general
topics
and
more
of
immediate
facts
sir
james
is
better
acquainted
with
the
balance
of
an
argument
in
old
authors
brougham
with
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
if
the
first
is
better
versed
in
the
progress
of
history
no
man
excels
the
last
in
a
knowledge
of
the
course
of
exchange
he
is
apprised
of
the
exact
state
of
our
exports
and
imports
and
scarce
a
ship
clears
out
its
cargo
at
liverpool
or
hull
but
he
has
notice
of
the
bill
of
lading
our
colonial
policy
the
state
of
the
hulks
agricultural
distress
commerce
and
manufactures
the
bullion
question
the
catholic
question
the
bourbons
or
the
inquisition
domestic
treason
foreign
levy
nothing
can
come
amiss
to
him
he
is
at
home
in
the
crooked
mazes
of
rotten
boroughs
is
not
baffled
by
scotch
law
and
can
follow
the
meaning
of
one
of
canning
speeches
with
so
many
resources
with
such
variety
and
solidity
of
information
brougham
is
rather
a
powerful
and
alarming
than
an
effectual
debater
in
so
many
details
which
he
himself
goes
through
with
unwearied
and
unshrinking
resolution
the
spirit
of
the
question
is
lost
to
others
who
have
not
the
same
voluntary
power
of
attention
or
the
same
interest
in
hearing
that
he
has
in
speaking
the
original
impulse
that
urged
him
forward
is
forgotten
in
so
wide
a
field
in
so
interminable
a
career
if
he
can
others
carry
all
he
knows
in
their
heads
at
the
same
time
a
rope
of
circumstantial
evidence
does
not
hold
well
together
nor
drag
the
unwilling
mind
along
with
it
the
willing
mind
hurries
on
before
it
and
grows
impatient
and
absent
he
moves
in
an
unmanageable
procession
of
facts
and
proofs
instead
of
coming
to
the
point
at
once
and
his
premises
so
anxious
is
he
to
proceed
on
sure
and
ample
grounds
overlay
and
block
up
his
conclusion
so
that
you
can
not
arrive
at
it
or
not
till
the
first
fury
and
shock
of
the
onset
is
over
the
ball
from
the
too
great
width
of
the
from
which
it
is
sent
and
from
striking
against
such
a
number
of
hard
projecting
points
is
almost
spent
before
it
reaches
its
destination
he
keeps
a
ledger
or
a
account
between
the
government
and
the
country
posts
so
much
actual
crime
corruption
and
injustice
against
so
much
contingent
advantage
or
sluggish
prejudice
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
brings
in
the
balance
of
indignation
and
contempt
where
it
is
due
but
people
are
not
to
be
contempt
or
indignation
on
abstract
grounds
for
however
they
may
submit
to
this
process
where
their
own
interests
are
concerned
in
what
regards
the
public
good
we
believe
they
must
see
and
feel
instinctively
or
not
at
all
there
is
it
is
to
be
lamented
a
good
deal
of
froth
as
well
as
strength
in
the
popular
spirit
which
will
not
admit
of
being
or
served
out
in
formal
driblets
nor
will
spleen
the
soul
of
opposition
bear
to
be
corked
up
in
square
patent
bottles
and
kept
for
future
use
in
a
word
brougham
is
ticketed
and
labelled
eloquence
registered
and
in
numeros
like
the
successive
parts
of
a
scotch
encyclopedia
it
is
clever
knowing
imposing
masterly
an
extraordinary
display
of
clearness
of
head
of
quickness
and
energy
of
thought
of
application
and
industry
but
it
is
not
the
eloquence
of
the
imagination
or
the
heart
and
will
never
save
a
nation
or
an
individual
from
perdition
brougham
has
one
considerable
advantage
in
debate
he
is
overcome
by
no
false
modesty
no
deference
to
others
but
then
by
a
natural
consequence
or
parity
of
reasoning
he
has
little
sympathy
with
other
people
and
is
liable
to
be
mistaken
in
the
effect
his
arguments
will
have
upon
them
he
relies
too
much
among
other
things
on
the
patience
of
his
hearers
and
on
his
ability
to
turn
every
thing
to
his
own
advantage
he
accordingly
goes
to
the
full
length
of
in
vulgar
phrase
and
often
overshoots
the
mark
he
has
no
reserve
of
discretion
no
retentiveness
of
mind
or
check
upon
himself
he
needs
with
so
much
wit
as
much
again
to
govern
it
he
can
not
keep
a
good
thing
or
a
shrewd
piece
of
information
in
his
possession
though
the
letting
it
out
should
mar
a
cause
it
is
not
that
he
thinks
too
much
of
himself
too
little
of
his
cause
but
he
is
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
as
an
abstract
inquiry
he
is
led
away
by
the
headstrong
and
activity
of
his
own
mind
he
is
borne
along
almost
involuntarily
and
not
impossibly
against
his
better
judgment
by
the
throng
and
restlessness
of
his
ideas
as
by
a
crowd
of
people
in
motion
his
perceptions
are
literal
tenacious
his
understanding
voracious
of
facts
and
equally
communicative
of
them
and
he
proceeds
to
pour
out
all
as
plain
as
downright
shippen
or
as
old
montaigne
without
either
the
virulence
of
the
one
or
the
of
the
other
the
repeated
smart
unforeseen
discharges
of
the
truth
jar
those
that
are
next
him
he
does
not
dislike
this
state
of
irritation
and
collision
indulges
his
curiosity
or
his
triumph
till
by
calling
for
more
facts
or
hazarding
some
extreme
inference
he
urges
a
question
to
the
verge
of
a
precipice
his
adversaries
urge
it
and
he
himself
shrinks
back
from
the
consequence
scared
at
the
sound
himself
has
made
brougham
has
great
fearlessness
but
not
equal
firmness
and
after
going
too
far
on
the
turns
short
round
without
due
warning
to
others
or
respect
for
himself
he
is
adventurous
but
easily
and
sacrifices
the
vanity
of
to
the
necessity
of
he
is
too
improvident
for
a
leader
too
petulant
for
a
partisan
and
does
not
sufficiently
consult
those
with
whom
he
is
supposed
to
act
in
concert
he
sometimes
leaves
them
in
the
lurch
and
is
sometimes
left
in
the
lurch
by
them
he
wants
the
principle
of
he
frequently
in
a
fit
of
thoughtless
levity
gives
an
unexpected
turn
to
the
political
machine
which
alarms
older
and
more
experienced
heads
if
he
was
not
himself
the
first
to
get
out
of
way
and
escape
from
the
danger
it
would
be
well
we
hold
indeed
as
a
general
rule
that
no
man
born
or
bred
in
scotland
can
be
a
great
orator
unless
he
is
a
mere
quack
or
a
great
statesman
unless
he
turns
plain
knave
the
national
gravity
is
against
the
first
the
national
caution
is
against
the
last
to
a
scotchman
if
a
thing
it
there
is
an
end
of
the
question
with
his
opinion
about
it
he
is
positive
and
abrupt
and
is
not
in
the
habit
of
conciliating
the
feelings
or
soothing
the
follies
of
others
his
only
way
therefore
to
produce
a
popular
effect
is
to
sail
with
the
stream
of
prejudice
and
to
vent
common
dogmas
the
total
grist
unsifted
husks
and
all
from
some
evangelical
pulpit
this
may
answer
and
it
has
answered
on
the
other
hand
if
a
scotchman
born
or
bred
comes
to
think
at
all
of
the
feelings
of
others
it
is
not
as
they
regard
them
but
as
their
opinion
reacts
on
his
own
interest
and
safety
he
is
therefore
either
pragmatical
and
offensive
or
if
he
tries
to
please
he
becomes
cowardly
and
fawning
his
public
spirit
wants
pliancy
his
selfish
compliances
go
all
lengths
he
is
as
impracticable
as
a
popular
partisan
as
he
is
mischievous
as
a
tool
of
government
we
do
not
wish
to
press
this
argument
farther
and
must
leave
it
involved
in
some
degree
of
obscurity
rather
than
bring
the
armed
intellect
of
a
whole
nation
on
our
heads
brougham
speaks
in
a
loud
and
unmitigated
tone
of
voice
sometimes
almost
approaching
to
a
scream
he
is
fluent
rapid
vehement
full
of
his
subject
with
evidently
a
great
deal
to
say
and
very
regardless
of
the
manner
of
saying
it
as
a
lawyer
he
has
not
hitherto
been
remarkably
successful
he
is
not
profound
in
cases
and
reports
nor
does
he
take
much
interest
in
the
peculiar
features
of
a
particular
cause
or
shew
much
adroitness
in
the
management
of
it
he
carries
too
much
weight
of
metal
for
ordinary
and
petty
occasions
he
must
have
a
pretty
large
question
to
discuss
and
must
make
work
of
it
he
however
had
an
encounter
with
phillips
the
other
day
and
shook
all
his
tender
blossoms
so
that
they
fell
to
the
ground
and
withered
in
an
hour
but
they
soon
bloomed
again
brougham
writes
almost
if
not
quite
as
well
as
he
speaks
in
the
midst
of
an
election
contest
he
comes
out
to
address
the
populace
and
goes
back
to
his
study
to
finish
an
article
for
the
edinburgh
review
sometimes
indeed
wedging
three
or
four
articles
in
the
shape
of
of
his
own
pamphlets
or
speeches
in
parliament
into
a
single
number
such
indeed
is
the
activity
of
his
mind
that
it
appears
to
require
neither
repose
nor
any
other
stimulus
than
a
delight
in
its
own
exercise
he
can
turn
his
hand
to
any
thing
but
he
can
not
be
idle
there
are
few
intellectual
accomplishments
which
he
does
not
possess
and
possess
in
a
very
high
degree
he
speaks
french
and
we
believe
several
other
modern
languages
fluently
is
a
capital
mathematician
and
obtained
an
introduction
to
the
celebrated
carnot
in
this
latter
character
when
the
conversation
turned
on
squaring
the
circle
and
not
on
the
propriety
of
confining
france
within
the
natural
boundary
of
the
rhine
brougham
is
in
fact
a
striking
instance
of
the
versatility
and
strength
of
the
human
mind
and
also
in
one
sense
of
the
length
of
human
life
if
we
make
a
good
use
of
our
time
there
is
room
enough
to
crowd
almost
every
art
and
science
into
it
if
we
pass
no
day
without
a
line
visit
no
place
without
the
company
of
a
book
we
may
with
ease
fill
libraries
or
empty
them
of
their
contents
those
who
complain
of
the
shortness
of
life
let
it
slide
by
them
without
wishing
to
seize
and
make
the
most
of
its
golden
minutes
the
more
we
do
the
more
we
can
do
the
more
busy
we
are
the
more
leisure
we
have
if
any
one
possesses
any
advantage
in
a
considerable
degree
he
may
make
himself
master
of
nearly
as
many
more
as
he
pleases
by
employing
his
spare
time
and
cultivating
the
waste
faculties
of
his
mind
while
one
person
is
determining
on
the
choice
of
a
profession
or
study
another
shall
have
made
a
fortune
or
gained
a
merited
reputation
while
one
person
is
dreaming
over
the
meaning
of
a
word
another
will
have
learnt
several
languages
it
is
not
incapacity
but
indolence
indecision
want
of
imagination
and
a
proneness
to
a
sort
of
mental
tautology
to
repeat
the
same
images
and
tread
the
same
circle
that
leaves
us
so
poor
so
dull
and
inert
as
we
are
so
naked
of
acquirement
so
barren
of
resources
while
we
are
walking
backwards
and
forwards
between
and
and
sitting
in
the
same
every
day
we
might
make
the
grand
tour
of
europe
and
visit
the
vatican
and
the
louvre
brougham
among
other
means
of
strengthening
and
enlarging
his
views
has
visited
we
believe
most
of
the
courts
and
turned
his
attention
to
most
of
the
constitutions
of
the
continent
he
is
no
doubt
a
very
accomplished
and
admirable
person
sir
francis
burdett
in
many
respects
affords
a
contrast
to
the
foregoing
character
he
is
a
plain
unaffected
unsophisticated
english
gentleman
he
is
a
person
of
great
reading
too
and
considerable
information
but
he
makes
very
little
display
of
these
unless
it
be
to
quote
shakespear
which
he
does
often
with
extreme
aptness
and
felicity
sir
francis
is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
speakers
in
the
house
and
is
a
prodigious
favourite
of
the
english
people
so
he
ought
to
be
for
he
is
one
of
the
few
remaining
examples
of
the
old
english
understanding
and
old
english
character
all
that
he
pretends
to
is
common
sense
and
common
honesty
and
a
greater
compliment
can
not
be
paid
to
these
than
the
attention
with
which
he
is
listened
to
in
the
house
of
commons
we
can
not
conceive
a
higher
proof
of
courage
than
the
saying
things
which
he
has
been
known
to
say
there
and
we
have
seen
him
blush
and
appear
ashamed
of
the
truths
he
has
been
obliged
to
utter
like
a
bashful
novice
he
could
not
have
uttered
what
he
often
did
there
if
besides
his
general
respectability
he
had
not
been
a
very
honest
a
very
and
a
very
man
but
there
was
evidently
no
wish
to
shine
nor
any
desire
to
offend
it
was
painful
to
him
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
those
who
heard
him
but
it
was
a
higher
duty
in
him
not
to
suppress
his
sincere
and
earnest
convictions
it
is
wonderful
how
much
virtue
and
a
man
may
be
guilty
of
with
impunity
if
he
has
no
vanity
or
or
duplicity
to
provoke
the
contempt
or
resentment
of
others
and
to
make
them
impatient
of
the
superiority
he
sets
up
over
them
we
do
not
recollect
that
sir
francis
ever
endeavoured
to
atone
for
any
occasional
indiscretions
or
intemperance
by
giving
the
duke
of
york
credit
for
the
battle
of
waterloo
or
congratulating
ministers
on
the
confinement
of
buonaparte
at
helena
there
is
no
honest
cause
which
he
dares
not
avow
no
oppressed
individual
that
he
is
not
forward
to
succour
he
has
the
firmness
of
manhood
with
the
unimpaired
enthusiasm
of
youthful
feeling
about
him
his
principles
are
mellowed
and
improved
without
having
become
less
sound
with
time
for
at
one
period
he
sometimes
appeared
to
come
charged
to
the
house
with
the
petulance
and
caustic
sententiousness
he
had
imbibed
at
wimbledon
common
he
is
never
violent
or
in
extremes
except
when
the
people
or
the
parliament
happen
to
be
out
of
their
senses
and
then
he
seems
to
regret
the
necessity
of
plainly
telling
them
he
thinks
so
instead
of
pluming
himself
upon
it
or
exulting
over
impending
calamities
there
is
only
one
error
he
seems
to
labour
under
which
we
believe
he
also
borrowed
from
horne
tooke
or
major
cartwright
the
wanting
to
go
back
to
the
early
times
of
our
constitution
and
history
in
search
of
the
principles
of
law
and
liberty
he
might
as
well
hunt
half
a
day
for
a
forgotten
dream
liberty
in
our
opinion
is
but
a
modern
invention
the
growth
of
books
and
printing
and
whether
new
or
old
is
not
the
less
desirable
a
man
may
be
a
patriot
without
being
an
antiquary
this
is
the
only
point
on
which
sir
francis
is
at
all
inclined
to
a
tincture
of
pedantry
in
general
his
love
of
liberty
is
pure
as
it
is
warm
and
steady
his
humanity
is
unconstrained
and
free
his
heart
does
not
ask
leave
of
his
head
to
feel
nor
does
prudence
always
keep
a
guard
upon
his
tongue
or
his
pen
no
man
writes
a
better
letter
to
his
constituents
than
the
member
for
westminster
and
his
compositions
of
that
kind
ought
to
be
good
for
they
have
occasionally
cost
him
dear
he
is
the
idol
of
the
people
of
westminster
few
persons
have
a
greater
number
of
friends
and
and
he
has
still
greater
reason
to
be
proud
of
his
enemies
for
his
integrity
and
independence
have
made
them
so
sir
francis
burdett
has
often
been
left
in
a
minority
in
the
house
of
commons
with
only
one
or
two
on
his
side
we
suspect
unfortunately
for
his
country
that
history
will
be
found
to
enter
its
protest
on
the
same
side
of
the
question

a

by

and
wilberforce
lord
eldon
is
an
exceedingly
man
but
this
does
not
prevent
him
like
other
people
from
consulting
his
own
ease
or
interest
the
character
of
as
it
is
called
has
been
a
good
deal
mistaken
and
the
present
chancellor
is
not
a
bad
illustration
of
the
grounds
of
the
prevailing
error
when
we
happen
to
see
an
individual
whose
countenance
is
all
tranquillity
and
smiles
who
is
full
of
and
pleasantry
whose
manners
are
gentle
and
conciliating
who
is
uniformly
temperate
in
his
expressions
and
punctual
and
just
in
his
dealings
we
are
apt
to
conclude
from
so
fair
an
outside
that
all
is
conscience
and
tender
heart
within
also
and
that
such
a
one
would
not
hurt
a
fly
and
neither
would
he
without
a
motive
but
mere
or
what
passes
in
the
world
for
such
is
often
no
better
than
indolent
selfishness
a
person
distinguished
and
praised
for
this
quality
will
not
needlessly
offend
others
because
they
may
retaliate
and
besides
it
ruffles
his
own
temper
he
likes
to
enjoy
a
perfect
calm
and
to
live
in
an
interchange
of
kind
offices
he
suffers
few
things
to
irritate
or
annoy
him
he
has
a
fine
oiliness
in
his
disposition
which
smooths
the
waves
of
passion
as
they
rise
he
does
not
enter
into
the
quarrels
or
enmities
of
others
bears
their
calamities
with
patience
he
listens
to
the
din
and
clang
of
war
the
earthquake
and
the
hurricane
of
the
political
and
moral
world
with
the
temper
and
spirit
of
a
philosopher
no
act
of
injustice
puts
him
beside
himself
the
follies
and
absurdities
of
mankind
never
give
him
a
moment
uneasiness
he
has
none
of
the
ordinary
causes
of
fretfulness
or
chagrin
that
torment
others
from
the
undue
interest
they
take
in
the
conduct
of
their
neighbours
or
in
the
public
good
none
of
these
idle
or
frivolous
sources
of
discontent
that
make
such
havoc
with
the
peace
of
human
life
ever
discompose
his
features
or
alter
the
serenity
of
his
pulse
if
a
nation
is
robbed
of
its
rights
if
wretches
hang
that
ministers
may
dine
the
laughing
jest
still
collects
in
his
eye
the
cordial
squeeze
of
the
hand
is
still
the
same
but
tread
on
the
toe
of
one
of
these
amiable
and
imperturbable
mortals
or
let
a
lump
of
soot
fall
down
the
chimney
and
spoil
their
dinners
and
see
how
they
will
bear
it
all
their
patience
is
confined
to
the
accidents
that
befal
others
all
their
is
to
be
resolved
into
giving
themselves
no
concern
about
any
thing
but
their
own
ease
and
their
charity
begins
and
ends
at
home
their
being
free
from
the
common
infirmities
of
temper
is
owing
to
their
indifference
to
the
common
feelings
of
humanity
and
if
you
touch
the
sore
place
they
betray
more
resentment
and
break
out
like
spoiled
children
into
greater
fractiousness
than
others
partly
from
a
greater
degree
of
selfishness
and
partly
because
they
are
taken
by
surprise
and
mad
to
think
they
have
not
guarded
every
point
against
annoyance
or
attack
by
a
habit
of
callous
insensibility
and
pampered
indolence
an
instance
of
what
we
mean
occurred
but
the
other
day
an
allusion
was
made
in
the
house
of
commons
to
something
in
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
chancery
and
the
lord
chancellor
comes
to
his
place
in
the
court
with
the
statement
in
his
hand
fire
in
his
eyes
and
a
direct
charge
of
falsehood
in
his
mouth
without
knowing
any
thing
certain
of
the
matter
without
making
any
inquiry
into
it
without
using
any
precaution
or
putting
the
least
restraint
upon
himself
and
all
on
no
better
authority
than
a
common
newspaper
report
the
thing
was
not
that
we
are
imputing
any
strong
blame
in
this
case
we
merely
bring
it
as
an
illustration
it
touched
himself
his
office
the
inviolability
of
his
jurisdiction
the
unexceptionableness
of
his
proceedings
and
the
wet
blanket
of
the
chancellor
temper
instantly
took
fire
like
tinder
all
the
fine
balancing
was
at
an
end
all
the
doubts
all
the
delicacy
all
the
candour
real
or
affected
all
the
chances
that
there
might
be
a
mistake
in
the
report
all
the
decencies
to
be
observed
towards
a
member
of
the
house
are
overlooked
by
the
blindness
of
passion
and
the
wary
judge
pounces
upon
the
paragraph
without
mercy
without
a
delay
or
the
smallest
attention
to
forms
this
was
indeed
serious
business
there
was
to
be
no
trifling
here
every
instant
was
an
age
till
the
chancellor
had
discharged
his
sense
of
indignation
on
the
head
of
the
indiscreet
interloper
on
his
authority
had
it
been
another
person
case
another
person
dignity
that
had
been
compromised
another
person
conduct
that
had
been
called
in
question
who
doubts
but
that
the
matter
might
have
stood
over
till
the
next
term
that
the
noble
lord
would
have
taken
the
newspaper
home
in
his
pocket
that
he
would
have
compared
it
carefully
with
other
newspapers
that
he
would
have
written
in
the
most
mild
and
gentlemanly
terms
to
the
honourable
member
to
inquire
into
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
he
would
have
watched
a
convenient
opportunity
to
ask
other
honourable
members
what
all
this
was
about
that
the
greatest
caution
and
fairness
would
have
been
observed
and
that
to
this
hour
the
lawyers
clerks
and
the
junior
counsel
would
have
been
in
the
greatest
admiration
of
the
chancellor
nicety
of
discrimination
and
the
utter
inefficacy
of
the
heats
importunities
haste
and
passions
of
others
to
influence
his
judgment
this
would
have
been
true
yet
his
readiness
to
decide
and
to
condemn
where
he
himself
is
concerned
shews
that
passion
is
not
dead
in
him
nor
subject
to
the
controul
of
reason
but
that
is
the
that
moves
it
though
on
all
beyond
that
limit
he
looks
with
the
most
perfect
calmness
and
philosophic
indifference
resistless
passion
sways
us
to
the
mood
of
what
it
likes
or
loaths
all
people
are
passionate
in
what
concerns
themselves
or
in
what
they
take
an
interest
in
the
range
of
this
last
is
different
in
different
persons
but
the
want
of
passion
is
but
another
name
for
the
want
of
sympathy
and
imagination
the
lord
chancellor
impartiality
and
conscientious
exactness
is
proverbial
and
is
we
believe
as
inflexible
as
it
is
delicate
in
all
cases
that
occur
in
the
stated
routine
of
legal
practice
the
impatience
the
irritation
the
hopes
the
fears
the
confident
tone
of
the
applicants
move
him
not
a
jot
from
his
intended
course
he
looks
at
their
claims
with
the
lack
lustre
eye
of
prefessional
indifference
power
and
influence
apart
his
next
strongest
passion
is
to
indulge
in
the
exercise
of
professional
learning
and
skill
to
amuse
himself
with
the
dry
details
and
intricate
windings
of
the
law
of
equity
he
delights
to
balance
a
straw
to
see
a
feather
turn
the
scale
or
make
it
even
again
and
divides
and
subdivides
a
scruple
to
the
smallest
fraction
he
unravels
the
web
of
argument
and
pieces
it
together
again
folds
it
up
and
lays
it
aside
that
he
may
examine
it
more
at
his
leisure
he
hugs
indecision
to
his
breast
and
takes
home
a
modest
doubt
or
a
nice
point
to
solace
himself
with
it
in
protracted
luxurious
dalliance
delay
seems
in
his
mind
to
be
of
the
very
essence
of
justice
he
no
more
hurries
through
a
question
than
if
no
one
was
waiting
for
the
result
and
he
was
merely
a
fanciful
judge
who
played
at
my
lord
chancellor
and
busied
himself
with
quibbles
and
punctilios
as
an
idle
hobby
and
harmless
illusion
the
phlegm
of
the
chancellor
disposition
gives
one
almost
a
surfeit
of
impartiality
and
candour
we
are
sick
of
the
eternal
poise
of
childish
dilatoriness
and
would
wish
law
and
justice
to
be
decided
at
once
by
a
cast
of
the
dice
as
they
were
in
rabelais
rather
than
be
kept
in
frivolous
and
tormenting
suspense
but
there
is
a
limit
even
to
this
extreme
refinement
and
scrupulousness
of
the
chancellor
the
understanding
acts
only
in
the
absence
of
the
passions
at
the
approach
of
the
loadstone
the
needle
trembles
and
points
to
it
the
air
of
a
political
question
has
a
wonderful
tendency
to
brace
and
quicken
the
learned
lord
faculties
the
breath
of
a
court
speedily
oversets
a
thousand
objections
and
scatters
the
cobwebs
of
his
brain
the
secret
wish
of
power
is
a
thumping
where
all
is
so
beforehand
in
the
case
of
a
celebrated
beauty
and
heiress
and
the
brother
of
a
noble
lord
the
chancellor
hesitated
long
and
went
through
the
forms
as
usual
but
who
ever
doubted
where
all
this
indecision
would
end
no
man
in
his
senses
for
a
single
instant
we
shall
not
press
this
point
which
is
rather
a
ticklish
one
some
persons
thought
that
from
entertaining
a
on
the
subject
the
chancellor
would
have
been
ready
to
favour
the
application
to
the
court
of
chancery
for
an
injunction
against
wat
tyler
his
lordship
sentiments
on
such
points
are
not
so
variable
he
has
too
much
at
stake
he
recollected
the
year
though
southey
had
forgotten
it
the
personal
always
prevails
over
the
intellectual
where
the
latter
is
not
backed
by
strong
feeling
and
principle
where
remote
and
speculative
objects
do
not
excite
a
predominant
interest
and
passion
gross
and
immediate
ones
are
sure
to
carry
the
day
even
in
ingenuous
and
minds
the
will
yields
necessarily
to
some
motive
or
other
and
where
the
public
good
or
distant
consequences
excite
no
sympathy
in
the
breast
either
from
or
an
easiness
of
temperament
that
shrinks
from
any
violent
effort
or
painful
emotion
indolence
the
opinion
of
others
a
desire
to
please
the
sense
of
personal
obligation
come
in
and
fill
up
the
void
of
public
spirit
patriotism
and
humanity
the
best
men
in
the
world
in
their
own
natural
dispositions
or
in
private
life
for
this
reason
often
become
the
most
dangerous
public
characters
from
their
pliancy
to
the
unruly
passions
of
others
and
from
their
having
no
in
strong
moral
to
the
temptations
that
are
held
out
to
them
if
as
is
frequently
the
case
they
are
men
of
versatile
talent
or
patient
lord
eldon
has
one
of
the
faces
in
the
world
it
is
pleasant
to
meet
him
in
the
street
plodding
along
with
an
umbrella
under
his
arm
without
one
trace
of
pride
of
spleen
or
discontent
in
his
whole
demeanour
void
of
offence
with
almost
rustic
simplicity
and
honesty
of
appearance
a
man
that
makes
friends
at
first
sight
and
could
hardly
make
enemies
if
he
would
and
whose
only
fault
is
that
he
can
not
say
to
power
or
subject
himself
to
an
unkind
word
or
look
from
a
king
or
a
minister
he
is
a
tory
others
boggle
or
are
at
fault
in
their
career
or
give
back
at
a
pinch
they
split
into
different
factions
have
various
objects
to
distract
them
their
private
friendships
or
antipathies
stand
in
their
way
but
he
has
never
flinched
never
gone
back
never
missed
his
way
he
is
an
in
this
respect
his
allegiance
has
been
without
flaw
like
one
entire
and
perfect
chrysolite
his
implicit
understanding
is
a
kind
of
to
the
crown
his
servility
has
assumed
an
air
of
the
most
determined
independence
and
he
has
read
his
history
in
a
prince
eyes
there
has
been
no
stretch
of
power
attempted
in
his
time
that
he
has
not
seconded
no
existing
abuse
so
odious
or
so
absurd
that
he
has
not
sanctioned
it
he
has
gone
the
whole
length
of
the
most
unpopular
designs
of
ministers
when
the
heavy
artillery
of
interest
power
and
prejudice
is
brought
into
the
field
the
paper
pellets
of
the
brain
go
for
nothing
his
labyrinth
of
nice
doubts
explodes
like
a
mine
of
the
chancellor
may
weigh
and
palter
the
courtier
is
decided
the
politician
is
firm
and
rivetted
to
his
place
in
the
cabinet
on
all
the
great
questions
that
have
divided
party
opinion
or
agitated
the
public
mind
the
chancellor
has
been
found
uniformly
and
without
a
single
exception
on
the
side
of
prerogative
and
power
and
against
every
proposal
for
the
advancement
of
freedom
he
was
a
strenuous
supporter
of
the
wars
and
coalitions
against
the
principles
of
liberty
abroad
he
has
been
equally
zealous
in
urging
or
defending
every
act
and
infringement
of
the
constitution
for
abridging
it
at
home
he
at
the
same
time
opposes
every
amelioration
of
the
penal
laws
on
the
alleged
ground
of
his
abhorrence
of
even
the
shadow
of
innovation
he
has
studiously
set
his
face
against
catholic
emancipation
he
laboured
hard
in
his
vocation
to
prevent
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
he
was
attorney
general
in
the
trials
for
high
treason
in
and
the
other
day
in
giving
his
opinion
on
the
queen
trial
shed
tears
and
protested
his
innocence
before
god
this
was
natural
and
to
be
expected
but
on
all
occasions
he
is
to
be
found
at
his
post
true
to
the
call
of
prejudice
of
power
to
the
will
of
others
and
to
his
own
interest
in
the
whole
of
his
public
career
and
with
all
the
goodness
of
his
disposition
he
has
not
shewn
so
small
a
drop
of
pity
as
a
wren
eye
he
seems
to
be
on
his
guard
against
every
thing
liberal
and
humane
as
his
weak
side
others
relax
in
their
obsequiousness
either
from
satiety
or
disgust
or
a
hankering
after
popularity
or
a
wish
to
be
thought
above
narrow
prejudices
the
chancellor
alone
is
fixed
and
immoveable
is
it
want
of
understanding
or
of
principle
no
it
is
want
of
imagination
a
phlegmatic
habit
an
excess
of
false
complaisance
and
common
humanity
and
justice
are
little
better
than
vague
terms
to
him
he
acts
upon
his
immediate
feelings
and
least
irksome
impulses
the
king
hand
is
velvet
to
the
touch
the
woolsack
is
a
seat
of
honour
and
profit
that
is
all
he
knows
about
the
matter
as
to
abstract
metaphysical
calculations
the
ox
that
stands
staring
at
the
corner
of
the
street
troubles
his
head
as
much
about
them
as
he
does
yet
this
last
is
a
very
good
sort
of
animal
with
no
harm
or
malice
in
him
unless
he
is
goaded
on
to
mischief
and
then
it
is
necessary
to
keep
out
of
his
way
or
warn
others
against
him
wilberforce
is
a
less
perfect
character
in
his
way
he
acts
from
mixed
motives
he
would
willingly
serve
two
masters
god
and
mammon
he
is
a
person
of
many
excellent
and
admirable
qualifications
but
he
has
made
a
mistake
in
wishing
to
reconcile
those
that
are
incompatible
he
has
a
most
winning
eloquence
specious
persuasive
familiar
is
amiable
charitable
conscientious
pious
loyal
humane
tractable
to
power
accessible
to
popularity
honouring
the
king
and
no
less
charmed
with
the
homage
of
his
what
lacks
he
then
nothing
but
an
economy
of
good
parts
by
aiming
at
too
much
he
has
spoiled
all
and
neutralised
what
might
have
been
an
estimable
character
distinguished
by
signal
services
to
mankind
a
man
must
take
his
choice
not
only
between
virtue
and
vice
but
between
different
virtues
otherwise
he
will
not
gain
his
own
approbation
or
secure
the
respect
of
others
the
graces
and
accomplishments
of
private
life
mar
the
man
of
business
and
the
statesman
there
is
a
severity
a
sternness
a
and
a
painful
sense
of
duty
required
in
the
one
which
ill
befits
the
softness
and
sweetness
which
should
characterise
the
other
loyalty
patriotism
friendship
humanity
are
all
virtues
but
may
they
not
sometimes
clash
by
being
unwilling
to
forego
the
praise
due
to
any
we
may
forfeit
the
reputation
of
all
and
instead
of
uniting
the
suffrages
of
the
whole
world
in
our
favour
we
may
end
in
becoming
a
sort
of
for
affectation
cant
hollow
professions
trimming
fickleness
and
effeminate
imbecility
it
is
best
to
choose
and
act
up
to
some
one
leading
character
as
it
is
best
to
have
some
settled
profession
or
regular
pursuit
in
life
we
can
readily
believe
that
wilberforce
first
object
and
principle
of
action
is
to
do
what
he
thinks
right
his
next
and
that
we
fear
is
of
almost
equal
weight
with
the
first
is
to
do
what
will
be
thought
so
by
other
people
he
is
always
at
a
game
of
and
between
these
two
his
conscience
will
not
budge
unless
the
world
goes
with
it
he
does
not
seem
greatly
to
dread
the
denunciation
in
scripture
but
rather
to
court
it
woe
unto
you
when
all
men
shall
speak
well
of
you
we
suspect
he
is
not
quite
easy
in
his
mind
because
planters
and
guinea
traders
do
not
join
in
his
praise
his
ears
are
not
strongly
enough
tuned
to
drink
in
the
execrations
of
the
spoiler
and
the
oppressor
as
the
sweetest
music
it
is
not
enough
that
one
half
of
the
human
species
the
images
of
god
carved
in
ebony
as
old
fuller
calls
them
shout
his
name
as
a
champion
and
a
saviour
through
vast
burning
zones
and
moisten
their
parched
lips
with
the
gush
of
gratitude
for
deliverance
from
chains
he
must
have
a
drink
his
health
at
a
for
aiding
to
rivet
on
those
of
his
country
and
of
europe
he
goes
hand
and
heart
along
with
government
in
all
their
notions
of
legitimacy
and
political
aggrandizement
in
the
hope
that
they
will
leave
him
a
sort
of
of
humanity
in
the
great
desert
where
his
reputation
for
benevolence
and
public
spirit
may
spring
up
and
flourish
till
its
head
touches
the
clouds
and
it
stretches
out
its
branches
to
the
farthest
part
of
the
earth
he
has
no
mercy
on
those
who
claim
a
property
in
as
so
much
on
their
estates
the
country
rings
with
the
applause
of
his
wit
his
eloquence
and
his
indignant
appeals
to
common
sense
and
humanity
on
this
subject
but
not
a
word
has
he
to
say
not
a
whisper
does
he
breathe
against
the
claim
set
up
by
the
despots
of
the
earth
over
their
continental
subjects
but
does
every
thing
in
his
power
to
confirm
and
sanction
it
he
must
give
no
offence
humanity
will
go
all
lengths
that
it
can
with
safety
and
discretion
but
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
it
should
lose
him
his
seat
for
yorkshire
the
smile
of
majesty
or
the
countenance
of
the
loyal
and
pious
he
is
anxious
to
do
all
the
good
he
can
without
hurting
himself
or
his
fair
fame
his
conscience
and
his
character
compound
matters
very
amicably
he
rather
patronises
honesty
than
is
a
martyr
to
it
his
patriotism
his
philanthropy
are
not
so
as
to
quarrel
with
his
loyalty
or
to
banish
him
from
the
first
circles
he
preaches
vital
christianity
to
untutored
savages
and
tolerates
its
worst
abuses
in
civilized
states
he
thus
shews
his
respect
for
religion
without
offending
the
clergy
or
circumscribing
the
sphere
of
his
usefulness
there
is
in
all
this
an
appearance
of
a
good
deal
of
cant
and
tricking
his
patriotism
may
be
accused
of
being
servile
his
humanity
ostentatious
his
loyalty
conditional
his
religion
a
mixture
of
fashion
and
fanaticism
out
upon
such
fellowship
wilberforce
has
the
pride
of
being
familiar
with
the
great
the
vanity
of
being
popular
the
conceit
of
an
approving
conscience
he
is
coy
in
his
approaches
to
power
his
public
spirit
is
in
a
manner
the
he
thus
reaps
the
credit
of
independence
without
the
obloquy
and
secures
the
advantages
of
servility
without
incurring
any
obligations
he
has
two
strings
to
his
bow
he
by
no
means
neglects
his
worldly
interests
while
he
expects
a
bright
reversion
in
the
skies
wilberforce
is
far
from
being
a
hypocrite
but
he
is
we
think
as
fine
a
specimen
of
as
can
well
be
conceived
a
hypocrite
is
one
who
is
the
very
reverse
of
or
who
despises
the
character
he
pretends
to
be
wilberforce
would
be
all
that
he
pretends
to
be
and
he
is
it
in
fact
as
far
as
words
plausible
theories
good
inclinations
and
easy
services
go
but
not
in
heart
and
soul
or
so
as
to
give
up
the
appearance
of
any
one
of
his
pretensions
to
preserve
the
reality
of
any
other
he
carefully
chooses
his
ground
to
fight
the
battles
of
loyalty
religion
and
humanity
and
it
is
such
as
is
always
safe
and
advantageous
to
himself
this
is
perhaps
hardly
fair
and
it
is
of
dangerous
or
doubtful
tendency
lord
eldon
for
instance
is
known
to
be
a
ministerialist
his
opinion
is
only
that
of
his
party
but
wilberforce
is
not
a
he
is
the
more
looked
up
to
on
this
account
but
not
with
sufficient
reason
by
tampering
with
different
temptations
and
personal
projects
he
has
all
the
air
of
the
most
perfect
independence
and
gains
a
character
for
impartiality
and
candour
when
he
is
only
striking
a
balance
in
his
mind
between
the
of
differing
from
a
minister
on
some
ground
and
the
risk
or
odium
that
may
attend
it
he
carries
all
the
weight
of
his
artificial
popularity
over
to
the
government
on
vital
points
and
questions
while
they
in
return
lend
him
a
little
of
the
gilding
of
to
set
off
his
disinterested
philanthropy
and
tramontane
enthusiasm
as
a
leader
or
a
follower
he
makes
an
odd
jumble
of
interests
by
virtue
of
religious
sympathy
he
has
brought
the
saints
over
to
the
side
of
the
abolition
of
negro
slavery
this
his
adversaries
think
hard
and
stealing
a
march
upon
them
what
have
the
saints
to
do
with
freedom
or
reform
of
any
kind
mr
wilberforce
style
of
speaking
is
not
quite
it
is
halfway
between
that
and
he
is
altogether
a
the
very
tone
of
his
voice
is
a
it
winds
and
undulates
and
glides
up
and
down
on
texts
of
scripture
and
scraps
from
paley
and
trite
sophistry
and
pathetic
appeals
to
his
hearers
in
a
faltering
inprogressive
sidelong
way
like
those
birds
of
weak
wing
that
are
borne
from
their
course
by
every
little
breath
that
under
heaven
is
blown
something
of
this
fluctuating
principle
was
visible
even
in
the
great
question
of
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
he
was
at
one
time
half
inclined
to
surrender
it
into
pitt
dilatory
hands
and
seemed
to
think
the
gloss
of
novelty
was
gone
from
it
and
the
gaudy
colouring
of
popularity
sunk
into
the
ground
from
which
it
rose
it
was
however
persisted
in
and
carried
to
a
triumphant
conclusion
wilberforce
said
too
little
on
this
occasion
of
one
compared
with
whom
he
was
but
the
frontispiece
to
that
great
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
mask
the
varnishing
and
painting
the
man
that
effected
it
by
herculean
labours
of
body
and
equally
gigantic
labours
of
mind
was
clarkson
the
true
apostle
of
human
redemption
on
that
occasion
and
who
it
is
remarkable
resembles
in
his
person
and
lineaments
more
than
one
of
the
apostles
in
the
of
raphael
he
deserves
to
be
added
to
the
twelve
a
footnote
a
after
all
the
best
as
well
as
most
amusing
comment
on
the
character
just
described
was
that
made
by
sheridan
who
being
picked
up
in
no
very
creditable
plight
by
the
watch
and
asked
rather
roughly
who
he
was
made
answer
i
am
mr
wilberforce
the
guardians
of
the
night
conducted
him
home
with
all
the
honours
due
to
grace
and
nature
southey
southey
as
we
formerly
remember
to
have
seen
him
had
a
hectic
flush
upon
his
cheek
a
roving
fire
in
his
eye
a
falcon
glance
a
look
at
once
aspiring
and
dejected
it
was
the
look
that
had
been
impressed
upon
his
face
by
the
events
that
marked
the
outset
of
his
life
it
was
the
dawn
of
liberty
that
still
tinged
his
cheek
a
smile
betwixt
hope
and
sadness
that
still
played
upon
his
quivering
lip
southey
mind
is
essentially
sanguine
even
to
it
is
prophetic
of
good
it
cordially
embraces
it
it
casts
a
longing
lingering
look
after
it
even
when
it
is
gone
for
ever
he
can
not
bear
to
give
up
the
thought
of
happiness
his
confidence
in
his
when
all
else
despair
it
is
the
very
element
where
he
must
live
or
have
no
life
at
all
while
he
supposed
it
possible
that
a
better
form
of
society
could
be
introduced
than
any
that
had
hitherto
existed
while
the
light
of
the
french
revolution
beamed
into
his
soul
and
long
after
it
was
seen
reflected
on
his
brow
like
the
light
of
setting
suns
on
the
peak
of
some
high
mountain
or
lonely
range
of
clouds
floating
in
purer
ether
while
he
had
this
hope
this
faith
in
man
left
he
cherished
it
with
simplicity
he
clung
to
it
with
the
fondness
of
a
lover
he
was
an
enthusiast
a
fanatic
a
leveller
he
stuck
at
nothing
that
he
thought
would
banish
all
pain
and
misery
from
the
world
in
his
impatience
of
the
smallest
error
or
injustice
he
would
have
sacrificed
himself
and
the
existing
generation
a
holocaust
to
his
devotion
to
the
right
cause
but
when
he
once
believed
after
many
staggering
doubts
and
painful
struggles
that
this
was
no
longer
possible
when
his
chimeras
and
golden
dreams
of
human
perfectibility
vanished
from
him
he
turned
suddenly
round
and
maintained
that
whatever
is
right
southey
has
not
fortitude
of
mind
has
not
patience
to
think
that
evil
is
inseparable
from
the
nature
of
things
his
irritable
sense
rejects
the
alternative
altogether
as
a
weak
stomach
rejects
the
food
that
is
distasteful
to
it
he
hopes
on
against
hope
he
believes
in
all
unbelief
he
must
either
repose
on
actual
or
on
imaginary
good
he
missed
his
way
in
he
has
found
it
at
old
sarum
his
generous
no
cold
medium
knows
his
eagerness
admits
of
no
doubt
or
delay
he
is
ever
in
extremes
and
ever
in
the
wrong
the
reason
is
that
not
truth
but
is
the
ruling
principle
of
southey
mind
the
charm
of
novelty
the
applause
of
the
multitude
the
sanction
of
power
the
venerableness
of
antiquity
pique
resentment
the
spirit
of
contradiction
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
his
preferences
his
inquiries
are
partial
and
hasty
his
conclusions
raw
and
unconcocted
and
with
a
considerable
infusion
of
whim
and
humour
and
a
monkish
spleen
his
opinions
are
like
certain
wines
warm
and
generous
when
new
but
they
will
not
keep
and
soon
turn
flat
or
sour
for
want
of
a
stronger
spirit
of
the
understanding
to
give
a
body
to
them
he
wooed
liberty
as
a
youthful
lover
but
it
was
perhaps
more
as
a
mistress
than
a
bride
and
he
has
since
wedded
with
an
elderly
and
not
very
reputable
lady
called
legitimacy
wilful
according
to
the
scotch
proverb
have
his
if
it
were
the
cause
to
which
he
was
sincerely
attached
he
would
adhere
to
it
through
good
report
and
evil
report
but
it
is
himself
to
whom
he
does
homage
and
would
have
others
do
so
and
he
therefore
changes
sides
rather
than
submit
to
apparent
defeat
or
temporary
mortification
abstract
principle
has
no
rule
but
the
understood
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
the
indulgence
of
vanity
of
caprice
or
prejudice
is
regulated
by
the
convenience
or
bias
of
the
moment
the
temperament
of
our
mind
is
poetical
not
philosophical
he
is
more
the
creature
of
impulse
than
he
is
of
reflection
he
invents
the
unreal
he
embellishes
the
false
with
the
glosses
of
fancy
but
pays
little
attention
to
the
words
of
truth
and
soberness
his
impressions
are
accidental
immediate
personal
instead
of
being
permanent
and
universal
of
all
mortals
he
is
surely
the
most
impatient
of
contradiction
even
when
he
has
completely
turned
the
tables
on
himself
is
not
this
very
inconsistency
the
reason
is
he
not
tenacious
of
his
opinions
in
proportion
as
they
are
brittle
and
hastily
formed
is
he
not
jealous
of
the
grounds
of
his
belief
because
he
fears
they
will
not
bear
inspection
or
is
conscious
he
has
shifted
them
does
he
not
confine
others
to
the
strict
line
of
orthodoxy
because
he
has
himself
taken
every
liberty
is
he
not
afraid
to
look
to
the
right
or
the
left
lest
he
should
see
the
ghosts
of
his
former
extravagances
staring
him
in
the
face
does
he
not
refuse
to
tolerate
the
smallest
shade
of
difference
in
others
because
he
feels
that
he
wants
the
utmost
latitude
of
construction
for
differing
so
widely
from
himself
is
he
not
captious
dogmatical
petulant
in
delivering
his
sentiments
according
as
he
has
been
inconsistent
rash
and
fanciful
in
adopting
them
he
maintains
that
there
can
be
no
possible
ground
for
differing
from
him
because
he
looks
only
at
his
own
side
of
the
question
he
sets
up
his
own
favourite
notions
as
the
standard
of
reason
and
honesty
because
he
has
changed
from
one
extreme
to
another
he
treats
his
opponents
with
contempt
because
he
is
himself
afraid
of
meeting
with
disrespect
he
says
that
a
reformer
is
a
worse
character
than
a
in
order
to
stifle
the
recollection
that
he
himself
once
was
one
we
must
say
that
we
relish
southey
more
in
the
reformer
than
in
his
lately
acquired
but
by
no
means
natural
or
becoming
character
of
and
courtier
he
may
rest
assured
that
a
garland
of
wild
flowers
suits
him
better
than
the
that
his
pastoral
odes
and
popular
inscriptions
were
far
more
adapted
to
his
genius
than
his
he
is
nothing
akin
to
suits
and
fopperies
he
is
nothing
if
not
fantastical
in
his
figure
in
his
movements
in
his
sentiments
he
is
sharp
and
angular
quaint
and
eccentric
southey
is
not
of
the
court
courtly
every
thing
of
him
and
about
him
is
from
the
people
he
is
not
classical
he
is
not
legitimate
he
is
not
a
man
cast
in
the
mould
of
other
opinions
he
is
not
shaped
on
any
model
he
bows
to
no
authority
he
yields
only
to
his
own
wayward
peculiarities
he
is
wild
irregular
singular
extreme
he
is
no
formalist
not
he
all
is
crude
and
chaotic
vain
he
wants
proportion
keeping
system
standard
rules
he
is
not
et
southey
walks
with
his
chin
erect
through
the
streets
of
london
and
with
an
umbrella
sticking
out
under
his
arm
in
the
finest
weather
he
has
not
sacrificed
to
the
graces
nor
studied
decorum
with
him
every
thing
is
projecting
starting
from
its
place
an
episode
a
digression
a
poetic
license
he
does
not
move
in
any
given
orbit
but
like
a
falling
star
shoots
from
his
sphere
he
is
pragmatical
restless
unfixed
full
of
experiments
beginning
every
thing
wiser
than
his
betters
judging
for
himself
dictating
to
others
he
is
decidedly
he
may
have
given
up
the
reform
of
the
state
but
depend
upon
it
he
has
some
other
of
the
same
kind
does
he
not
dedicate
to
his
present
majesty
that
extraordinary
poem
on
the
death
of
his
father

of
as
a
specimen
of
what
might
be
done
in
english
hexameters

be
trite

on
an
approved
model
he
might
as
well
have
presented
himself
at
the
levee
in
a
fancy
or
masquerade
dress
southey
was
not
try
with
majesty
still
less
on
such
an
occasion

extreme
freedoms
with
departed
greatness
the
carried
to
the
throne
of
grace
the
unchecked
indulgence
of
private
humour
the
assumption
of
infallibility
and
even
of
the
voice
of
heaven
in
this
poem
are
pointed
instances
of
what
we
have
said
they
shew
the
singular
state
of
of
southey
mind
and
the
force
of
old
habits
of
independent
and
unbridled
thinking
which
can
not
be
kept
down
even
in
addressing
his
sovereign
look
at
southey
larger
poems
his
his
his
his
who
will
deny
the
spirit
the
scope
the
splendid
imagery
the
hurried
and
startling
interest
that
pervades
them
who
will
say
that
they
are
not
sustained
on
fictions
wilder
than
his
own
glendoveer
that
they
are
not
the
daring
creations
of
a
mind
curbed
by
no
law
tamed
by
no
fear
that
they
are
not
rather
like
the
trances
than
the
waking
dreams
of
genius
that
they
are
not
the
very
paradoxes
of
poetry
all
this
is
very
well
very
intelligible
and
very
harmless
if
we
regard
the
rank
excrescences
of
southey
poetry
like
the
red
and
blue
flowers
in
corn
as
the
unweeded
growth
of
a
luxuriant
and
wandering
fancy
or
if
we
allow
the
yeasty
workings
of
an
ardent
spirit
to
ferment
and
boil
over
the
variety
the
boldness
the
lively
stimulus
given
to
the
mind
may
then
atone
for
the
violation
of
rules
and
the
offences
to
authority
but
not
if
our
poetic
libertine
sets
up
for
a
and
judge
or
an
apprehender
of
vagrants
in
the
regions
either
of
taste
or
opinion
our
motley
gentleman
deserves
the
if
he
is
for
setting
others
in
the
stocks
of
servility
or
condemning
them
to
the
pillory
for
a
new
mode
of
rhyme
or
reason
or
if
a
composer
of
sacred
dramas
on
classic
models
or
a
translator
of
an
old
latin
author
that
will
hardly
bear
translation
or
a
of
vapid
cantos
and
odes
set
to
music
were
to
turn
pander
to
prescription
and
palliater
of
every
dull
incorrigible
abuse
it
would
not
be
much
to
be
wondered
at
or
even
regretted
but
in
southey
it
was
a
lamentable
it
is
indeed
to
be
deplored
it
is
a
stain
on
genius
a
blow
to
humanity
that
the
author
of
of
that
work
in
which
the
love
of
liberty
is
exhaled
like
the
breath
of
spring
mild
balmy
that
is
full
of
tears
and
and
yearnings
of
affection
after
truth
and
good
gushing
warm
and
crimsoned
from
the
heart
should
ever
after
turn
to
folly
or
become
the
advocate
of
a
rotten
cause
after
giving
up
his
heart
to
that
subject
he
ought
not
whatever
others
might
do
ever
to
have
set
his
foot
within
the
threshold
of
a
court
he
might
be
sure
that
he
would
not
gain
forgiveness
or
favour
by
it
nor
obtain
a
single
cordial
smile
from
greatness
all
that
southey
is
or
that
he
does
best
is
independent
spontaneous
free
as
the
vital
air
he
draws
when
he
affects
the
courtier
or
the
sophist
he
is
obliged
to
put
a
constraint
upon
himself
to
hold
in
his
breath
he
loses
his
genius
and
offers
a
violence
to
his
nature
his
characteristic
faults
are
the
excess
of
a
lively
unguarded
temperament
oh
let
them
not
degenerate
into
heartless
vices
if
we
speak
or
have
ever
spoken
of
southey
with
severity
it
is
with
the
malice
of
old
friends
for
we
count
ourselves
among
his
sincerest
and
heartiest
but
while
he
himself
is
anomalous
incalculable
eccentric
from
youth
to
age
the
and
the
of
are
the
alpha
and
omega
of
his
disjointed
career
full
of
sallies
of
humour
of
ebullitions
of
spleen
making
cascades
fountains
and
of
his
idle
opinions
he
would
shut
up
the
wits
of
others
in
leaden
cisterns
to
stagnate
and
corrupt
or
bury
them
under
ground
far
from
the
sun
and
summer
gale
he
would
suppress
the
freedom
of
wit
and
humour
of
which
he
has
set
the
example
and
claim
a
privilege
for
playing
antics
he
would
introduce
an
uniformity
of
intellectual
weights
and
measures
of
irregular
metres
and
settled
opinions
and
enforce
it
with
a
high
hand
this
has
been
judged
hard
by
some
and
has
brought
down
a
severity
of
recrimination
perhaps
disproportioned
to
the
injury
done
because
he
is
virtuous
it
has
been
asked
are
there
to
be
no
more
cakes
and
ale
because
he
is
loyal
are
we
to
take
all
our
notions
from
the
because
he
is
orthodox
are
we
to
do
nothing
but
read
the
of
the
we
declare
we
think
his
former
poetical
scepticism
was
not
only
more
amiable
but
had
more
of
the
spirit
of
religion
in
it
implied
a
more
heartfelt
trust
in
nature
and
providence
than
his
present
bigotry
we
are
at
the
same
time
free
to
declare
that
we
think
his
articles
in
the
review
notwithstanding
their
virulence
and
the
talent
they
display
have
a
tendency
to
qualify
its
most
pernicious
effects
they
have
redeeming
traits
in
them
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
and
the
spirit
of
humanity
thanks
to
southey
is
not
quite
expelled
from
the
at
the
corner
of
his
pen
there
hangs
a
vapourous
drop
profound
of
independence
and
liberality
which
falls
upon
its
pages
and
oozes
out
through
the
pores
of
the
public
mind
there
is
a
fortunate
difference
between
writers
whose
hearts
are
naturally
callous
to
truth
and
whose
understandings
are
hermetically
sealed
against
all
impressions
but
those
of
and
a
man
like
southey
a
philanthropist
and
always
a
no
man
can
entirely
baulk
his
nature
it
breaks
out
in
spite
of
him
in
all
those
questions
where
the
spirit
of
contradiction
does
not
interfere
on
which
he
is
not
sore
from
old
bruises
or
sick
from
the
extravagance
of
youthful
intoxication
as
from
a
last
night
debauch
our
laureate
is
still
bold
free
candid
open
to
conviction
a
reformist
without
knowing
it
he
does
not
advocate
the
he
does
not
arm
malthus
revolting
ratios
with
his
authority
he
does
not
strain
hard
to
deluge
ireland
with
blood
on
such
points
where
humanity
has
not
become
obnoxious
where
liberty
has
not
passed
into
a
southey
is
still
liberal
and
humane
the
elasticity
of
his
spirit
is
unbroken
the
bow
recoils
to
its
old
position
he
still
stands
convicted
of
his
early
passion
for
inquiry
and
improvement
he
was
not
regularly
articled
as
a
perhaps
the
most
pleasing
and
striking
of
all
southey
poems
are
not
his
triumphant
taunts
hurled
against
oppression
are
not
his
glowing
effusions
to
liberty
but
those
in
which
with
a
mild
melancholy
he
seems
conscious
of
his
own
infirmities
of
temper
and
to
feel
a
wish
to
correct
by
thought
and
time
the
precocity
and
sharpness
of
his
disposition
may
the
quaint
but
affecting
aspiration
expressed
in
one
of
these
be
fulfilled
that
as
he
mellows
into
maturer
age
all
such
asperities
may
wear
off
and
he
himself
become
like
the
high
leaves
upon
the
southey
can
scarcely
be
too
much
praised
it
is
plain
clear
pointed
familiar
perfectly
modern
in
its
texture
but
with
a
grave
and
sparkling
admixture
of
in
its
ornaments
and
occasional
phraseology
he
is
the
best
and
most
natural
of
any
poet
of
the
day
we
mean
that
he
is
far
better
than
lord
byron
wordsworth
or
coleridge
for
instance
the
manner
is
perhaps
superior
to
the
matter
that
is
in
his
essays
and
reviews
there
is
rather
a
want
of
originality
and
even
of
but
there
is
no
want
of
playful
or
biting
satire
of
ingenuity
of
casuistry
of
learning
and
of
information
he
is
full
of
wise
saws
and
modern
as
well
as
ancient
instances
southey
may
not
always
convince
his
opponents
but
he
seldom
fails
to
stagger
never
to
gall
them
in
a
word
we
may
describe
his
style
by
saying
that
it
has
not
the
body
or
thickness
of
port
wine
but
is
like
clear
sherry
with
kernels
of
old
authors
thrown
into
it
he
also
excels
as
an
historian
and
his
histories
abound
in
information
and
exhibit
proofs
of
the
most
indefatigable
patience
and
industry
by
no
uncommon
process
of
the
mind
southey
seems
willing
to
steady
the
extreme
levity
of
his
opinions
and
feelings
by
an
appeal
to
facts
his
translations
of
the
spanish
and
french
romances
are
also
executed
and
with
the
literal
fidelity
and
care
of
a
mere
linguist
that
of
the
in
particular
is
a
masterpiece
not
a
word
could
be
altered
for
the
better
in
the
old
scriptural
style
which
it
adopts
in
conformity
to
the
original
it
is
no
less
interesting
in
itself
or
as
a
record
of
high
and
chivalrous
feelings
and
manners
than
it
is
worthy
of
perusal
as
a
literary
curiosity
southey
conversation
has
a
little
resemblance
to
a
book
his
habitual
deportment
to
a
piece
of
he
is
not
remarkable
either
as
a
reasoner
or
an
observer
but
he
is
quick
unaffected
replete
with
anecdote
various
and
retentive
in
his
reading
and
exceedingly
happy
in
his
play
upon
words
as
most
scholars
are
who
give
their
minds
this
sportive
turn
we
have
chiefly
seen
southey
in
company
where
few
people
appear
to
advantage
we
mean
in
that
of
coleridge
he
has
not
certainly
the
same
range
of
speculation
nor
the
same
flow
of
sounding
words
but
he
makes
up
by
the
details
of
knowledge
and
by
a
scrupulous
correctness
of
statement
for
what
he
wants
in
originality
of
thought
or
impetuous
declamation
the
tones
of
coleridge
voice
are
eloquence
those
of
southey
are
meagre
shrill
and
dry
coleridge
is
conversation
and
he
is
conscious
of
this
southey
evidently
considers
writing
as
his
and
if
gravelled
in
an
argument
or
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
refers
to
something
he
has
written
on
the
subject
or
brings
out
his
doubled
down
in
in
confirmation
of
some
fact
he
is
scholastic
and
professional
in
his
ideas
he
sets
more
value
on
what
he
writes
than
on
what
he
says
he
is
perhaps
prouder
of
his
library
than
of
his
own
productions
themselves
a
library
he
is
more
simple
in
his
manners
than
his
friend
coleridge
but
at
the
same
time
less
cordial
or
conciliating
he
is
less
vain
or
has
less
hope
of
pleasing
and
therefore
lays
himself
less
out
to
please
there
is
an
air
of
condescension
in
his
civility
with
a
tall
loose
figure
a
peaked
austerity
of
countenance
and
no
inclination
to
you
would
say
he
has
something
puritanical
something
ascetic
in
his
appearance
he
answers
to
mandeville
description
of
addison
a
parson
in
a
he
is
not
a
boon
companion
nor
does
he
indulge
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
nor
in
any
other
vice
nor
are
we
aware
that
southey
is
chargeable
with
any
human
frailty
but
of
having
fewer
errors
to
plead
guilty
to
he
is
less
lenient
to
those
of
others
he
was
born
an
age
too
late
had
he
lived
a
century
or
two
ago
he
would
have
been
a
happy
as
well
as
blameless
character
but
the
distraction
of
the
time
has
unsettled
him
and
the
multiplicity
of
his
pretensions
have
jostled
with
each
other
no
man
in
our
day
at
least
no
man
of
genius
has
led
so
uniformly
and
entirely
the
life
of
a
scholar
from
boyhood
to
the
present
hour
devoting
himself
to
learning
with
the
enthusiasm
of
an
early
love
with
the
severity
and
constancy
of
a
religious
vow
and
well
would
it
have
been
for
him
if
he
had
confined
himself
to
this
and
not
undertaken
to
pull
down
or
to
patch
up
the
state
however
irregular
in
his
opinions
southey
is
constant
unremitting
mechanical
in
his
studies
and
the
performance
of
his
duties
there
is
nothing
pindaric
or
shandean
here
in
all
the
relations
and
charities
of
private
life
he
is
correct
exemplary
generous
just
we
never
heard
a
single
impropriety
laid
to
his
charge
and
if
he
has
many
enemies
few
men
can
boast
more
numerous
or
stauncher
the
variety
and
piquancy
of
his
writings
form
a
striking
contrast
to
the
mode
in
which
they
are
produced
he
rises
early
and
writes
or
reads
till
he
writes
or
reads
after
breakfast
till
dinner
after
dinner
till
tea
and
from
tea
till
and
follows
so
the
year
with
profitable
labour
to
his
grave
on
derwent
banks
beneath
the
foot
of
skiddaw
study
serves
him
for
business
exercise
recreation
he
passes
from
verse
to
prose
from
history
to
poetry
from
reading
to
writing
by
a
he
writes
a
fair
hand
without
blots
sitting
upright
in
his
chair
leaves
off
when
he
comes
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
changes
the
subject
for
another
as
opposite
as
the
antipodes
his
mind
is
after
all
rather
the
recipient
and
transmitter
of
knowledge
than
the
originator
of
it
he
has
hardly
grasp
of
thought
enough
to
arrive
at
any
great
leading
truth
his
passions
do
not
amount
to
more
than
irritability
with
some
gall
in
his
pen
and
coldness
in
his
manner
he
has
a
great
deal
of
kindness
in
his
heart
rash
in
his
opinions
he
is
steady
in
his
attachments
and
is
a
man
in
many
particulars
admirable
in
all
respectable
his
political
inconsistency
alone
excepted
t
mr
leigh
hunt
or
winglet
of
the
fairy
like
atoms
of
the
rainbow
fluttering
round
campbell
the
lines
placed
at
the
head
of
this
sketch
from
a
contemporary
writer
appear
to
us
very
descriptive
of
moore
poetry
his
verse
is
like
a
shower
of
beauty
a
dance
of
images
a
stream
of
music
or
like
the
spray
of
the
tinged
by
the
with
rosy
light
the
characteristic
distinction
of
our
author
style
is
this
continuous
and
incessant
flow
of
voluptuous
thoughts
and
shining
allusions
he
ought
to
write
with
a
crystal
pen
on
silver
paper
his
subject
is
set
off
by
a
dazzling
veil
of
poetic
diction
like
a
wreath
of
flowers
gemmed
with
innumerous
dewdrops
that
weep
tremble
and
glitter
in
liquid
softness
and
pearly
light
while
the
song
of
birds
ravishes
the
ear
and
languid
odours
breathe
around
and
aurora
opens
smiling
portals
peris
and
nymphs
peep
through
the
golden
glades
and
an
angel
wing
glances
over
the
glossy
scene
no
dainty
flower
or
herb
that
grows
on
ground
no
arboret
with
painted
blossoms
drest
and
smelling
sweet
but
there
it
might
be
found
to
bud
out
fair
and
its
sweet
smells
throw
all
around
no
tree
whose
branches
did
not
bravely
spring
no
branch
whereon
a
fine
bird
did
not
sit
no
bird
but
did
her
shrill
notes
sweetly
sing
no
song
but
did
contain
a
lovely
dit
trees
branches
birds
and
songs
were
framed
fit
for
to
allure
frail
minds
to
careless
campbell
imagination
is
fastidious
and
select
and
hence
though
we
meet
with
more
exquisite
beauties
in
his
writings
we
meet
with
them
more
rarely
there
is
comparatively
a
dearth
of
ornament
but
moore
strictest
economy
is
wasteful
and
superfluous
excess
he
is
always
liberal
and
never
at
a
loss
for
sooner
than
not
stimulate
and
delight
the
reader
he
is
willing
to
be
tawdry
or
superficial
or
his
muse
must
be
fine
at
any
rate
though
she
should
paint
and
wear
decorations
rather
than
have
any
lack
of
excitement
he
repeats
himself
and
eden
and
eblis
and
fill
up
the
pauses
of
the
sentiment
with
a
sickly
it
has
been
too
much
our
author
object
to
pander
to
the
artificial
taste
of
the
age
and
his
productions
however
brilliant
and
agreeable
are
in
consequence
somewhat
meretricious
and
effeminate
it
was
thought
formerly
enough
to
have
an
occasionally
fine
passage
in
the
progress
of
a
story
or
a
poem
and
an
occasionally
striking
image
or
expression
in
a
fine
passage
or
description
but
this
style
it
seems
was
to
be
exploded
as
rude
gothic
meagre
and
dry
now
all
must
be
raised
to
the
same
tantalising
and
preposterous
level
there
must
be
no
pause
no
interval
no
repose
no
gradation
simplicity
and
truth
yield
up
the
palm
to
affectation
and
grimace
the
craving
of
the
public
mind
after
novelty
and
effect
is
a
false
and
uneasy
appetite
that
must
be
pampered
with
fine
words
at
every
step
we
must
be
tickled
with
sound
startled
with
shew
and
relieved
by
the
importunate
uninterrupted
display
of
fancy
and
verbal
tinsel
as
much
as
possible
from
the
fatigue
of
thought
or
shock
of
feeling
a
poem
is
to
resemble
an
exhibition
of
fireworks
with
a
continual
explosion
of
quaint
figures
and
devices
flash
after
flash
that
surprise
for
the
moment
and
leave
no
trace
of
light
or
warmth
behind
them
or
modern
poetry
in
its
retrograde
progress
comes
at
last
to
be
constructed
on
the
principles
of
the
modern
opera
where
an
attempt
is
made
to
gratify
every
sense
at
every
instant
and
where
the
understanding
alone
is
insulted
and
the
heart
mocked
it
is
in
this
view
only
that
we
can
discover
that
moore
poetry
is
vitiated
or
immoral
it
seduces
the
taste
and
enervates
the
imagination
it
creates
a
false
standard
of
reference
and
inverts
or
decompounds
the
natural
order
of
association
in
which
objects
strike
the
thoughts
and
feelings
his
is
the
poetry
of
the
bath
of
the
toilette
of
the
saloon
of
the
fashionable
world
not
the
poetry
of
nature
of
the
heart
or
of
human
life
he
stunts
and
enfeebles
equally
the
growth
of
the
imagination
and
the
affections
by
not
taking
the
seed
of
poetry
and
sowing
it
in
the
ground
of
truth
and
letting
it
expand
in
the
dew
and
rain
and
shoot
up
to
heaven
and
spread
its
sweet
leaves
to
the
air
or
dedicate
its
beauty
to
the
sun
instead
of
which
he
anticipates
and
defeats
his
own
object
by
plucking
flowers
and
blossoms
from
the
stem
and
setting
them
in
the
ground
of
idleness
and
folly
or
in
the
cap
of
his
own
vanity
where
they
soon
wither
and
disappear
dying
or
ere
they
sicken
this
is
but
a
sort
of
child
play
a
ambition
in
milton
we
meet
with
many
prosaic
lines
either
because
the
subject
does
not
require
raising
or
because
they
are
necessary
to
connect
the
story
or
serve
as
a
relief
to
other
passages
there
is
not
such
a
thing
to
be
found
in
all
writings
his
volumes
present
us
with
a
perpetual
feast
of
sweets
but
we
can
not
add
where
no
crude
surfeit
reigns
he
indeed
cloys
with
sweetness
he
obscures
with
splendour
he
fatigues
with
gaiety
we
are
stifled
on
beds
of
roses
we
literally
lie
on
the
rack
of
restless
ecstacy
his
flowery
fancy
looks
so
fair
and
smells
so
sweet
that
the
sense
aches
at
it
his
verse
droops
and
languishes
under
a
load
of
beauty
like
a
bough
laden
with
fruit
his
gorgeous
style
is
like
another
morn
risen
on
there
is
no
passage
that
is
not
made
up
of
blushing
lines
no
line
that
is
not
enriched
with
a
sparkling
metaphor
no
image
that
is
left
unadorned
with
a
double
epithet
all
his
verbs
nouns
adjectives
are
equally
glossy
smooth
and
beautiful
every
stanza
is
transparent
with
light
perfumed
with
odours
floating
in
liquid
harmony
melting
in
luxurious
evanescent
delights
his
muse
is
never
contented
with
an
offering
from
one
sense
alone
but
brings
another
rifled
charm
to
match
it
and
revels
in
a
fairy
round
of
pleasure
the
interest
is
not
dramatic
but
it
is
a
mixture
of
painting
poetry
and
music
of
the
natural
and
preternatural
of
obvious
sentiment
and
romantic
costume
a
rose
is
a
a
nightingale
a
we
might
fancy
ourselves
in
an
eastern
harem
amidst
ottomans
and
otto
of
roses
and
veils
and
spangles
and
marble
pillars
and
cool
fountains
and
arab
maids
and
genii
and
magicians
and
peris
and
cherubs
and
what
not
moore
has
a
little
mistaken
the
art
of
poetry
for
the
he
does
not
compose
an
historic
group
or
work
out
a
single
figure
but
throws
a
variety
of
elementary
sensations
of
vivid
impressions
together
and
calls
it
a
description
he
makes
out
an
inventory
of
beauty
the
smile
on
the
lips
the
dimple
on
the
cheeks
golden
locks
a
pair
of
blue
wings
a
silver
sound
with
breathing
fragrance
and
radiant
light
and
thinks
it
a
character
or
a
story
he
gets
together
a
number
of
fine
things
and
fine
names
and
thinks
that
flung
on
heaps
they
make
up
a
fine
poem
this
dissipated
fulsome
painted
style
may
succeed
in
the
levity
and
languor
of
the
or
might
have
been
adapted
to
the
pavilions
of
royalty
but
it
is
not
the
style
of
parnassus
nor
a
passport
to
immortality
it
is
not
the
taste
of
the
ancients
is
not
classical
lore
nor
the
fashion
of
tibullus
or
theocritus
or
anacreon
or
virgil
or
ariosto
or
pope
or
byron
or
any
great
writer
among
the
living
or
the
dead
but
it
is
the
style
of
our
english
anacreon
and
it
is
or
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
let
one
example
and
that
an
admired
one
taken
from
suffice
to
explain
the
mystery
and
soften
the
harshness
of
the
foregoing
criticism
now
upon
syria
land
of
roses
softly
the
light
of
eve
reposes
and
like
a
glory
the
broad
sun
hangs
over
sainted
lebanon
whose
head
in
wintry
grandeur
towers
and
whitens
with
eternal
sleet
while
summer
in
a
vale
of
flowers
is
sleeping
rosy
at
his
feet
to
one
who
look
from
upper
air
all
th
enchanted
regions
there
how
beauteous
must
have
been
the
glow
the
life
the
sparkling
from
below
fair
gardens
shining
streams
with
ranks
of
golden
melons
on
their
banks
more
golden
where
the
falls
gay
lizards
glittering
on
the
walls
of

shrines
busy
and
bright
as
they
were
all
alive
with

and
yet
more
splendid
numerous
flocks
of
pigeons
settling
on
the
rocks
with
their
rich
restless
wings
that
gleam
variously
in
the
crimson
beam
of
the
warm
west
as
if
inlaid
with
brilliants
from
the
mine
or
made
of
tearless
rainbows
such
as
span
the
unclouded
skies
of
peristan
and
then
the
mingling
sounds
that
come
of
shepherd
ancient
reed
with
hum
of
the
wild
bees
of
palestine
banquetting
through
the
flowery
vales

those
sweet

of
thine
and

so
full
of

the
following
lines
are
the
very
perfection
of
della
cruscan
sentiment
and
affected
orientalism
of

the

on
finding
that
old

hackneyed

joy

oh

i

to
thee
sweet

how
dark
and
sad
are
the
diamond
turrets
of
shadukiam
and
the
fragrant
bowers
of
amberabad
there
is
in
all
this
a
play
of
fancy
a
glitter
of
words
a
shallowness
of
thought
and
a
want
of
truth
and
solidity
that
is
wonderful
and
that
nothing
but
the
heedless
rapid
glide
of
the
verse
could
render
tolerable
it
seems
that
the
poet
as
well
as
the
lover
may
bestride
the
gossamer
that
wantons
in
the
idle
summer
air
and
yet
not
fall
so
light
is
vanity
moore
ought
not
to
contend
with
serious
difficulties
or
with
entire
subjects
he
can
write
verses
not
a
poem
there
is
no
principle
of
massing
or
of
continuity
in
his
productions
neither
height
nor
breadth
nor
depth
of
capacity
there
is
no
truth
of
representation
no
strong
internal
feeling
but
a
continual
flutter
and
display
of
affected
airs
and
graces
like
a
finished
coquette
who
hides
the
want
of
symmetry
by
extravagance
of
dress
and
the
want
of
passion
by
flippant
forwardness
and
unmeaning
sentimentality
all
is
flimsy
all
is
florid
to
excess
his
imagination
may
dally
with
insect
beauties
with
rosicrucian
spells
may
describe
a
butterfly
wing
a
a
fan
but
it
should
not
attempt
to
span
the
great
outlines
of
nature
or
keep
pace
with
the
sounding
march
of
events
or
grapple
with
the
strong
fibres
of
the
human
heart
the
great
becomes
turgid
in
his
hands
the
pathetic
insipid
if
moore
were
to
describe
the
heights
of
chimboraco
instead
of
the
loneliness
the
vastness
and
the
shadowy
might
he
would
only
think
of
adorning
it
with
roseate
tints
like
a
and
would
transform
a
magician
fortress
in
the
himmalaya
stripped
of
its
mysterious
gloom
and
frowning
horrors
into
a
jeweller
toy
to
be
set
upon
a
lady
toilette
in
proof
of
this
see
above
the
diamond
turrets
of
shadukiam
the
description
of
mokanna
in
the
fight
though
it
has
spirit
and
grandeur
of
effect
has
still
a
great
alloy
of
the
in
it
the
route
of
blood
and
death
which
is
otherwise
well
marked
is
infested
with
a
swarm
of
fancies
in
vain
mokanna
the
general
flight
stands
like
the
red
moon
in
some
stormy
night
among
the
fugitive
clouds
that
hurrying
by
leave
only
her
unshaken
in
the
sky
this
simile
is
fine
and
would
have
been
perfect
but
that
the
moon
is
not
red
and
that
she
seems
to
hurry
by
the
clouds
not
they
by
her
the
description
of
the
warrior
youthful
adversary
whose
coming
seems
a
light
a
glory
such
as
breaks
in
dreams
is
fantastic
and
enervated
a
field
of
battle
has
nothing
to
do
with
dreams
and
again
the
two
lines
immediately
after
and
every
sword
true
as
billows
dim
the
needle
tracks
the
following
him
are
a
mere
piece
of
enigmatical
ingenuity
and
scientific
we
can
not
except
the
from
the
same
censure
if
these
national
airs
do
indeed
express
the
soul
of
impassioned
feeling
in
his
countrymen
the
case
of
ireland
is
hopeless
if
these
prettinesses
pass
for
patriotism
if
a
country
can
heave
from
its
heart
core
only
these
vapid
varnished
sentiments
and
let
its
tears
of
blood
evaporate
in
an
empty
conceit
let
it
be
governed
as
it
has
been
there
are
here
no
tones
to
waken
liberty
to
console
humanity
moore
converts
the
wild
harp
of

into
a
musical
a

except
from
this
censure
the
author
political
squibs
and
the
penny
these
are
essences
are
nests
of
spicery
bitter
and
sweet
honey
and
gall
together
no
one
can
so
well
describe
the

speech
of

of
these
lines
and
hundreds
more
of
our
composition
we
wish
he
would
not
take
pains
to
make
us
think
of
them
with
less
pleasure
than
the
fudge
family
is
in
the
same
spirit
but
with
a
little
there

too
great
a
mixture
of
undisguised
jacobinism
and

la
figure
in
somewhat
quaintly
with

bourbons
the
poet
also
launches
the
lightning
of
political
indignation
but
it
rather
plays
round
and
illumines
his
own
pen
than
reaches
the
devoted
heads

which
it
is
aimed
moore
is
in
private
life
an
amiable
and
estimable
man
the
embellished
and
voluptuous
style
of
his
poetry
his
unpretending
origin
and
his
figure
soon
introduced
him
to
the
notice
of
the
great
and
his
gaiety
his
wit
his
and
many
agreeable
accomplishments
fixed
him
there
the
darling
of
his
friends
and
the
idol
of
fashion
if
he
is
no
longer
familiar
with
royalty
as
with
his
garter
the
fault
is
not
his
his
adherence
to
his
principles
caused
the
separation
his
love
of
his
country
was
the
cloud
that
intercepted
the
sunshine
of
this
is
so
far
well
moore
vindicates
his
own
dignity
but
the
sense
of
intrinsic
worth
of
fame
and
of
the
intimacy
of
the
great
makes
him
perhaps
a
little
too
fastidious
and
as
to
the
pretensions
of
others
he
has
been
so
long
accustomed
to
the
society
of
whig
lords
and
so
enchanted
by
the
smile
of
beauty
and
fashion
that
he
really
fancies
himself
one
of
the
to
which
he
is
admitted
on
sufferance
and
tries
very
unnecessarily
to
keep
others
out
of
it
he
talks
familiarly
of
works
that
are
or
are
not
read
in
circle
and
seated
smiling
and
at
his
ease
in
a
enlivening
the
owner
by
his
brisk
sallies
and
attic
conceits
is
shocked
as
he
passes
to
see
a
peer
of
the
realm
shake
hands
with
a
poet
there
is
a
little
indulgence
of
spleen
and
envy
a
little
servility
and
pandering
to
aristocratic
pride
in
this
proceeding
is
moore
bound
to
advise
a
noble
poet
to
get
as
fast
as
possible
out
of
a
certain
publication
lest
he
should
not
be
able
to
give
an
account
at
holland
or
at
lansdown
house
how
his
friend
lord
b
had
associated
himself
with
his
friend
h
is
he
afraid
that
the
spirit
of
monarchy
will
eclipse
the
fables
for
the
holy
alliance
in
virulence
and
plain
speaking
or
are
the
members
of
the
fudge
family
to
secure
a
monopoly
for
the
abuse
of
the
bourbons
and
the
doctrine
of
divine
right
because
he
is
genteel
and
sarcastic
may
not
others
be
paradoxical
and
argumentative
or
must
no
one
bark
at
a
minister
or
general
unless
they
have
been
first
dandled
like
a
little
french
in
the
lap
of
a
lady
of
quality
does
moore
insist
on
the
double
claim
of
birth
and
genius
as
a
title
to
respectability
in
all
advocates
of
the
popular
side
but
himself
or
is
he
anxious
to
keep
the
pretensions
of
his
patrician
and
plebeian
friends
quite
separate
so
as
to
be
himself
the
only
point
of
union
a
sort
of
between
the
two
it
is
idle
to
think
of
setting
bounds
to
the
weakness
and
illusions
of
as
long
as
it
is
confined
to
a
man
own
breast
but
it
ought
not
to
be
made
a
plea
for
holding
back
the
powerful
hand
that
is
stretched
out
to
save
another
struggling
with
the
tide
of
popular
prejudice
who
has
suffered
shipwreck
of
health
fame
and
fortune
in
a
common
cause
and
who
has
deserved
the
aid
and
the
good
wishes
of
all
who
are
on
principle
embarked
in
the
same
cause
by
equal
zeal
and
honesty
if
not
by
equal
talents
to
support
and
to
adorn
it
we
shall
conclude
the
present
article
with
a
short
notice
of
an
individual
who
in
the
cast
of
his
mind
and
in
political
principle
bears
no
very
remote
resemblance
to
the
patriot
and
wit
just
spoken
of
and
on
whose
merits
we
should
descant
at
greater
length
but
that
personal
intimacy
might
be
supposed
to
render
us
partial
it
is
well
when
personal
intimacy
produces
this
effect
and
when
the
light
that
dazzled
us
at
a
distance
does
not
on
a
closer
inspection
turn
out
an
opaque
substance
this
is
a
charge
that
none
of
his
friends
will
bring
against
leigh
hunt
he
improves
upon
acquaintance
the
author
translates
admirably
into
the
man
indeed
the
very
faults
of
his
style
are
virtues
in
the
individual
his
natural
gaiety
and
sprightliness
of
manner
his
high
animal
spirits
and
the
quality
of
his
mind
produce
an
immediate
fascination
and
intoxication
in
those
who
come
in
contact
with
him
and
carry
off
in
society
whatever
in
his
writings
may
to
some
seem
flat
and
impertinent
from
great
sanguineness
of
temper
from
great
quickness
and
unsuspecting
simplicity
he
runs
on
to
the
public
as
he
does
at
his
own
and
talks
about
himself
forgetting
that
he
is
not
always
among
friends
his
look
his
tone
are
required
to
point
many
things
that
he
says
his
frank
cordial
manner
reconciles
you
instantly
to
a
little
complacency
to
be
admired
he
needs
but
to
be
seen
but
perhaps
he
ought
to
be
seen
to
be
fully
appreciated
no
one
ever
sought
his
society
who
did
not
come
away
with
a
more
favourable
opinion
of
him
no
one
was
ever
disappointed
except
those
who
had
entertained
idle
prejudices
against
him
he
sometimes
trifles
with
his
readers
or
tires
of
a
subject
from
not
being
urged
on
by
the
stimulus
of
immediate
sympathy
but
in
conversation
he
is
all
life
and
animation
combining
the
vivacity
of
the
with
the
resources
of
the
wit
and
the
taste
of
the
scholar
the
personal
character
the
spontaneous
impulses
do
not
appear
to
excuse
the
author
unless
you
are
acquainted
with
his
situation
and
habits
like
some
proud
beauty
who
gives
herself
what
we
think
strange
airs
and
graces
under
a
mask
but
who
is
instantly
forgiven
when
she
shews
her
face
we
have
said
that
lord
byron
is
a
sublime
coxcomb
why
should
we
not
say
that
hunt
is
a
delightful
one
there
is
certainly
an
exuberance
of
satisfaction
in
his
manner
which
is
more
than
the
strict
logical
premises
warrant
and
which
dull
and
phlegmatic
constitutions
know
nothing
of
and
can
not
understand
till
they
see
it
he
is
the
only
poet
or
literary
man
we
ever
knew
who
puts
us
in
mind
of
sir
john
suckling
or
killigrew
or
carew
or
who
united
rare
intellectual
acquirements
with
outward
grace
and
natural
gentility
hunt
ought
to
have
been
a
gentleman
born
and
to
have
patronised
men
of
letters
he
might
then
have
played
and
sung
and
laughed
and
talked
his
life
away
have
written
manly
prose
elegant
verse
and
his
of
would
have
been
praised
by
blackwood
as
it
is
there
is
no
man
now
living
who
at
the
same
time
writes
prose
and
verse
so
well
with
the
exception
of
southey
an
exception
we
fear
that
will
be
little
palatable
to
either
of
these
gentlemen
his
prose
writings
however
display
more
consistency
of
principle
than
the
laureate
his
verses
more
taste
we
will
venture
to
oppose
his
third
canto
of
the
of
for
classic
elegance
and
natural
feeling
to
any
equal
number
of
lines
from
southey
epics
or
from
moore
lalla
rookh
in
a
more
gay
and
conversational
style
of
writing
we
think
his
to
lord
on
his
going
abroad
is
a
masterpiece
and
the
of
the
has
run
through
several
editions
a
light
familiar
grace
and
mild
unpretending
pathos
are
the
characteristics
of
his
more
sportive
or
serious
writings
whether
in
poetry
or
prose
a
smile
plays
round
the
features
of
the
one
a
tear
is
ready
to
start
from
the
thoughtful
gaze
of
the
other
he
perhaps
takes
too
little
pains
and
indulges
in
too
much
wayward
caprice
in
both
a
wit
and
a
poet
hunt
is
also
distinguished
by
fineness
of
tact
and
sterling
sense
he
has
only
been
a
visionary
in
humanity
the
fool
of
virtue
what
then
is
the
drawback
to
so
many
shining
qualities
that
has
made
them
useless
or
even
hurtful
to
their
owner
his
crime
is
to
have
been
editor
of
the
ten
years
ago
when
some
allusion
was
made
in
it
to
the
age
of
the
present
king
and
that
though
his
majesty
has
grown
older
our
luckless
politician
is
no
wiser
than
he
was
then
footnote
a
compare
his
songs
with
burns
footnote
b
there
was
a
little
man
and
he
had
a
little
soul
and
he
said
little
soul
let
us
try
parody
on
there
was
a
little
man
and
he
had
a
little
gun
one
should
think
this
exquisite
ridicule
of
a
pedantic
effusion
might
have
silenced
for
ever
the
automaton
that
delivered
it
but
the
official
personage
in
question
at
the
close
of
the
session
addressed
an
congratulation
to
the
prince
regent
on
a
bill
that
had
passed
as
if
to
repeat
and
insist
upon
our
errors
were
to
justify
them
elia
and
geoffrey
crayon
so
charles
lamb
and
washington
irvine
choose
to
designate
themselves
and
as
their
lucubrations
under
one
or
other
of
these
de
have
gained
considerable
notice
from
the
public
we
shall
here
attempt
to
discriminate
their
several
styles
and
manner
and
to
point
out
the
beauties
and
defects
of
each
in
treating
of
somewhat
similar
subjects
irvine
is
we
take
it
the
more
popular
writer
of
the
two
or
a
more
general
favourite
lamb
has
more
devoted
and
perhaps
more
judicious
partisans
irvine
is
by
birth
an
american
and
has
as
it
were
the
and
taken
off
patterns
with
great
skill
and
cleverness
from
our
best
known
and
happiest
writers
so
that
their
thoughts
and
almost
their
reputation
are
indirectly
transferred
to
his
page
and
smile
upon
us
from
another
hemisphere
like
the
pale
reflex
of
cynthia
brow
he
succeeds
to
our
admiration
and
our
sympathy
by
a
sort
of
prescriptive
title
and
traditional
privilege
lamb
on
the
contrary
being
native
to
the
manner
here
though
he
too
has
borrowed
from
previous
sources
instead
of
availing
himself
of
the
most
popular
and
admired
has
groped
out
his
way
and
made
his
most
successful
researches
among
the
more
obscure
and
intricate
though
certainly
not
the
least
pithy
or
pleasant
of
our
writers
washington
irvine
has
culled
and
transplanted
the
flowers
of
modern
literature
for
the
amusement
of
the
general
reader
lamb
has
raked
among
the
dust
and
cobwebs
of
a
more
remote
period
has
exhibited
specimens
of
curious
relics
and
pored
over
decayed
manuscripts
for
the
benefit
of
the
more
inquisitive
and
discerning
part
of
the
public
antiquity
after
a
time
has
the
grace
of
novelty
as
old
fashions
revived
are
mistaken
for
new
ones
and
a
certain
quaintness
and
singularity
of
style
is
an
agreeable
relief
to
the
smooth
and
insipid
monotony
of
modern
composition
lamb
has
succeeded
not
by
conforming
to
the
of
the
but
in
opposition
to
it
he
does
not
march
boldly
along
with
the
crowd
but
steals
off
the
pavement
to
pick
his
way
in
the
contrary
direction
he
prefers
to
when
the
full
tide
of
human
life
pours
along
to
some
festive
shew
to
some
pageant
of
a
day
elia
would
stand
on
one
side
to
look
over
an
old
or
stroll
down
some
deserted
pathway
in
search
of
a
pensive
inscription
over
a
tottering
or
some
quaint
device
in
architecture
illustrative
of
embryo
art
and
ancient
manners
lamb
has
the
very
soul
of
an
antiquarian
as
this
implies
a
reflecting
humanity
the
film
of
the
past
hovers
for
ever
before
him
he
is
shy
sensitive
the
reverse
of
every
thing
coarse
vulgar
obtrusive
and
he
would
fain
shuffle
off
this
mortal
coil
and
his
spirit
clothes
itself
in
the
garb
of
elder
time
homelier
but
more
durable
he
is
borne
along
with
no
pompous
paradoxes
shines
in
no
glittering
tinsel
of
a
fashionable
phraseology
is
neither
fop
nor
sophist
he
has
none
of
the
turbulence
or
froth
of
opinions
his
style
runs
pure
and
clear
though
it
may
often
take
an
underground
course
or
be
conveyed
through
lamb
does
not
court
popularity
nor
strut
in
gaudy
plumes
but
shrinks
from
every
kind
of
ostentatious
and
obvious
pretension
into
the
retirement
of
his
own
mind
the
bird
the
peacock
see
mark
what
a
sumptuous
pharisee
is
he
meridian
tempt
him
to
unfold
his
radiant
glories
azure
green
and
gold
he
treads
as
if
some
solemn
music
near
his
measured
step
were
governed
by
his
ear
and
seems
to
say
ye
meaner
fowl
give
place
i
am
all
splendour
dignity
and
grace
not
so
the
pheasant
on
his
charms
presumes
though
he
too
has
a
glory
in
his
plumes
he
retreats
with
modest
mien
to
the
close
copse
or
far
sequestered
green
and
shines
without
desiring
to
be
seen
these
lines
well
describe
the
modest
and
delicate
beauties
of
writings
contrasted
with
the
lofty
and
pretensions
of
some
of
his
contemporaries
this
gentleman
is
not
one
of
those
who
pay
all
their
homage
to
the
prevailing
idol
he
thinks
that
gauds
are
made
and
moulded
of
things
past
nor
does
he
give
to
dust
that
is
a
little
gilt
more
laud
than
gilt
his
convictions
do
not
in
broad
rumour
lie
nor
are
they
set
off
to
the
world
in
the
glistering
foil
of
fashion
but
live
and
breathe
aloft
in
those
pure
eyes
and
perfect
judgment
of
lamb
rather
affects
and
is
tenacious
of
the
obscure
and
remote
of
that
which
rests
on
its
own
intrinsic
and
silent
merit
which
scorns
all
alliance
or
even
the
suspicion
of
owing
any
thing
to
noisy
clamour
to
the
glare
of
circumstances
there
is
a
fine
tone
of
a
moral
perspective
in
his
writings
he
delights
to
dwell
on
that
which
is
fresh
to
the
eye
of
memory
he
yearns
after
and
covets
what
soothes
the
frailty
of
human
nature
that
touches
him
most
nearly
which
is
withdrawn
to
a
certain
distance
which
verges
on
the
borders
of
oblivion
that
piques
and
provokes
his
fancy
most
which
is
hid
from
a
superficial
glance
that
which
though
gone
by
is
still
remembered
is
in
his
view
more
genuine
and
has
given
more
vital
signs
that
it
will
live
than
a
thing
of
yesterday
that
may
be
forgotten
death
has
in
this
sense
the
spirit
of
life
in
it
and
the
shadowy
has
to
our
author
something
substantial
in
it
ideas
savour
most
of
reality
in
his
mind
or
rather
his
imagination
loiters
on
the
edge
of
each
and
a
page
of
his
writings
recals
to
our
fancy
the
on
the
grate
fluttering
in
its
dusky
tensity
with
its
idle
superstition
and
hospitable
welcome
lamb
has
a
distaste
to
new
faces
to
new
books
to
new
buildings
to
new
customs
he
is
shy
of
all
imposing
appearances
of
all
assumptions
of
of
all
adventitious
ornaments
of
all
mechanical
advantages
even
to
a
nervous
excess
it
is
not
merely
that
he
does
not
rely
upon
or
ordinarily
avail
himself
of
them
he
holds
them
in
abhorrence
he
utterly
abjures
and
discards
them
and
places
a
great
gulph
between
him
and
them
he
disdains
all
the
vulgar
artifices
of
authorship
all
the
cant
of
criticism
and
helps
to
notoriety
he
has
no
grand
swelling
theories
to
attract
the
visionary
and
the
enthusiast
no
passing
topics
to
allure
the
thoughtless
and
the
vain
he
evades
the
present
he
mocks
the
future
his
affections
revert
to
and
settle
on
the
past
but
then
even
this
must
have
something
personal
and
local
in
it
to
interest
him
deeply
and
thoroughly
he
pitches
his
tent
in
the
suburbs
of
existing
manners
brings
down
the
account
of
character
to
the
few
straggling
remains
of
the
last
generation
seldom
ventures
beyond
the
bills
of
mortality
and
occupies
that
nice
point
between
egotism
and
disinterested
humanity
no
one
makes
the
tour
of
our
southern
metropolis
or
describes
the
manners
of
the
last
age
so
well
as
lamb
with
so
fine
and
yet
so
formal
an
air
with
such
vivid
obscurity
with
such
arch
piquancy
such
picturesque
quaintness
such
smiling
pathos
how
admirably
he
has
sketched
the
former
inmates
of
the
sea
house
what
fine
fretwork
he
makes
of
their
double
and
single
entries
with
what
a
firm
yet
subtle
pencil
he
has
embodied
battle
opinions
on
how
notably
he
embalms
a
battered
how
delightfully
an
amour
that
was
cold
forty
years
ago
revives
in
his
pages
with
what
humour
he
introduces
us
to
his
relations
and
how
freely
he
serves
up
his
friends
certainly
some
of
his
portraits
are
and
will
do
to
hang
up
as
lasting
and
lively
emblems
of
human
infirmity
then
there
is
no
one
who
has
so
sure
an
ear
for
the
chimes
at
midnight
not
even
excepting
justice
shallow
nor
could
master
silence
himself
take
his
cheese
and
pippins
with
a
more
significant
and
satisfactory
air
with
what
a
gusto
lamb
describes
the
inns
and
courts
of
law
the
temple
and
as
if
he
had
been
a
student
there
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
and
had
been
as
well
acquainted
with
the
person
of
sir
francis
bacon
as
he
is
with
his
portrait
or
writings
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
john
gate
is
connected
with
more
intense
and
authentic
associations
in
his
mind
as
a
part
of
old
london
wall
or
as
the
frontispiece
time
out
of
mind
of
the
gentleman
magazine
he
haunts
like
a
gentle
spirit
the
avenues
to
the
are
thick
with
panting
recollections
and
still
breathes
the
balmy
breath
of
infancy
in
his
description
of
it
whittington
and
his
cat
are
a
fine
hallucination
for
lamb
historic
muse
and
we
believe
he
never
heartily
forgave
a
certain
writer
who
took
the
subject
of
guy
faux
out
of
his
hands
the
streets
of
london
are
his
teeming
with
wonder
with
life
and
interest
to
his
retrospective
glance
as
it
did
to
the
eager
eye
of
childhood
he
has
contrived
to
weave
its
tritest
traditions
into
a
bright
and
endless
romance
lamb
taste
in
books
is
also
fine
and
it
is
peculiar
it
is
not
the
worse
for
a
little
he
does
not
go
deep
into
the
scotch
novels
but
he
is
at
home
in
smollett
and
fielding
he
is
little
read
in
junius
or
gibbon
but
no
man
can
give
a
better
account
of
burton
anatomy
of
melancholy
or
sir
thomas
brown
or
fuller
worthies
or
john
bunyan
holy
war
no
one
is
more
unimpressible
to
a
specious
declamation
no
one
relishes
a
recondite
beauty
more
his
admiration
of
shakespear
and
milton
does
not
make
him
despise
pope
and
he
can
read
parnell
with
patience
and
gay
with
delight
his
taste
in
french
and
german
literature
is
somewhat
defective
nor
has
he
made
much
progress
in
the
science
of
political
economy
or
other
abstruse
studies
though
he
has
read
vast
folios
of
controversial
divinity
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
intricacy
of
style
and
to
save
himself
the
pain
of
thinking
lamb
is
a
good
judge
of
prints
and
pictures
his
admiration
of
hogarth
does
credit
to
both
particularly
when
it
is
considered
that
leonardo
da
vinci
is
his
next
greatest
favourite
and
that
his
love
of
the
does
not
proceed
from
a
want
of
taste
for
the
his
worst
fault
is
an
of
enthusiasm
which
occasionally
makes
him
take
a
surfeit
of
his
highest
mr
lamb
excels
in
familiar
conversation
almost
as
much
as
in
writing
when
his
modesty
does
not
overpower
his
he
is
as
little
of
a
proser
as
possible
but
he
out
the
finest
wit
and
sense
in
the
world
he
keeps
a
good
deal
in
the
at
first
till
some
excellent
conceit
pushes
him
forward
and
then
he
abounds
in
whim
and
pleasantry
there
is
a
primitive
simplicity
and
about
his
manners
and
a
quakerism
in
his
personal
appearance
which
is
however
relieved
by
a
fine
titian
head
full
of
dumb
eloquence
lamb
is
a
general
favourite
with
those
who
know
him
his
character
is
equally
singular
and
amiable
he
is
endeared
to
his
friends
not
less
by
his
foibles
than
his
virtues
he
insures
their
esteem
by
the
one
and
does
not
wound
their
by
the
other
he
gains
ground
in
the
opinion
of
others
by
making
no
advances
in
his
own
we
easily
admire
genius
where
the
diffidence
of
the
possessor
makes
our
acknowledgment
of
merit
seem
like
a
sort
of
patronage
or
act
of
condescension
as
we
willingly
extend
our
good
offices
where
they
are
not
exacted
as
obligations
or
repaid
with
sullen
the
style
of
the
essays
of
elia
is
liable
to
the
charge
of
a
certain
his
sentences
are
cast
in
the
mould
of
old
authors
his
expressions
are
borrowed
from
them
but
his
feelings
and
observations
are
genuine
and
original
taken
from
actual
life
or
from
his
own
breast
and
he
may
be
said
if
any
one
can
to
have
coined
his
heart
for
and
to
have
split
his
brain
for
fine
distinctions
lamb
from
the
peculiarity
of
his
exterior
and
address
as
an
author
would
probably
never
have
made
his
way
by
detached
and
independent
efforts
but
fortunately
for
himself
and
others
he
has
taken
advantage
of
the
periodical
press
where
he
has
been
stuck
into
notice
and
the
texture
of
his
compositions
is
assuredly
fine
enough
to
bear
the
broadest
glare
of
popularity
that
has
hitherto
shone
upon
them
lamb
literary
efforts
have
procured
him
civic
honours
a
thing
unheard
of
in
our
times
and
he
has
been
invited
in
his
character
of
elia
to
dine
at
a
select
party
with
the
lord
mayor
we
should
prefer
this
distinction
to
that
of
being
we
would
recommend
to
waithman
perusal
if
lamb
has
not
anticipated
us
the
and
the
of
the
same
author
as
an
agreeable
relief
to
the
noise
of
a
city
feast
and
the
heat
of
city
elections
a
friend
a
short
time
ago
quoted
some
lines
a
from
the
of
these
works
which
meeting
godwin
eye
he
was
so
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
passage
and
with
a
consciousness
of
having
seen
it
before
that
he
was
uneasy
till
he
could
recollect
where
and
after
hunting
in
vain
for
it
in
ben
jonson
beaumont
and
fletcher
and
other
not
unlikely
places
sent
to
lamb
to
know
if
he
could
help
him
to
the
author
washington
irvine
acquaintance
with
english
literature
begins
almost
where
lamb
ends
with
the
spectator
tom
brown
works
and
the
wits
of
queen
anne
he
is
not
bottomed
in
our
elder
writers
nor
do
we
think
he
has
tasked
his
own
faculties
much
at
least
on
english
ground
of
the
merit
of
his
and
new
york
stories
we
can
not
pretend
to
judge
but
in
his
and
he
gives
us
very
good
american
copies
of
our
british
essayists
and
novelists
which
may
be
very
well
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
and
as
proofs
of
the
capabilities
of
the
national
genius
but
which
might
be
dispensed
with
here
where
we
have
to
boast
of
the
originals
not
only
irvine
language
is
with
great
taste
and
felicity
modelled
on
that
of
addison
sterne
goldsmith
or
mackenzie
but
the
thoughts
and
sentiments
are
taken
at
the
rebound
and
as
they
are
brought
forward
at
the
present
period
want
both
freshness
and
probability
irvine
writings
are
literary
he
comes
to
england
for
the
first
time
and
being
on
the
spot
fancies
himself
in
the
midst
of
those
characters
and
manners
which
he
had
read
of
in
the
spectator
and
other
approved
authors
and
which
were
the
only
idea
he
had
hitherto
formed
of
the
parent
country
instead
of
looking
round
to
see
what
he
sets
to
work
to
describe
us
as
at
second
hand
he
has
parson
adams
or
sir
roger
de
coverley
in
his
and
he
makes
a
village
curate
or
a
country
in
yorkshire
or
hampshire
sit
to
these
admired
models
for
their
portraits
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
whatever
the
ingenious
author
has
been
most
delighted
with
in
the
representations
of
books
he
transfers
to
his
and
swears
that
he
has
found
it
actually
existing
in
the
course
of
his
observation
and
travels
through
great
britain
instead
of
tracing
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
society
since
addison
or
fielding
wrote
he
transcribes
their
account
in
a
different
and
thus
keeps
us
stationary
at
least
in
our
most
attractive
and
qualities
of
simplicity
honesty
hospitality
modesty
and
this
is
a
very
flattering
mode
of
turning
fiction
into
history
or
history
into
fiction
and
we
should
scarcely
know
ourselves
again
in
the
softened
and
altered
likeness
but
that
it
bears
the
date
of
and
issues
from
the
press
in
this
is
one
way
of
complimenting
our
national
and
tory
prejudices
and
coupled
with
literal
or
exaggerated
portraits
of
peculiarities
could
hardly
fail
to
please
the
first
essay
in
the
that
on
national
antipathies
is
the
best
but
after
that
the
sterling
ore
of
wit
or
feeling
is
gradually
spun
thinner
and
thinner
till
it
fades
to
the
shadow
of
a
shade
irvine
is
himself
we
believe
a
most
agreeable
and
deserving
man
and
has
been
led
into
the
natural
and
pardonable
error
we
speak
of
by
the
tempting
bait
of
european
popularity
in
which
he
thought
there
was
no
more
likely
method
of
succeeding
than
by
imitating
the
style
of
our
standard
authors
and
giving
us
credit
for
the
virtues
of
our
forefathers
footnote
a
the
description
of
sports
in
the
forest
to
see
the
sun
to
bed
and
to
arise
like
some
hot
amourist
with
glowing
eyes
we
should
not
feel
that
we
had
discharged
our
obligations
to
truth
or
friendship
if
we
were
to
let
this
volume
go
without
introducing
into
it
the
name
of
the
author
of
this
is
the
more
proper
inasmuch
as
he
is
a
character
by
himself
and
the
only
poet
now
living
that
is
a
mere
poet
if
we
were
asked
what
sort
of
a
man
knowles
is
we
could
only
say
he
is
the
writer
of
virginius
his
most
intimate
friends
see
nothing
in
him
by
which
they
could
trace
the
work
to
the
author
the
seeds
of
dramatic
genius
are
contained
and
fostered
in
the
warmth
of
the
blood
that
flows
in
his
veins
his
heart
dictates
to
his
head
the
most
unconscious
the
most
unpretending
the
most
artless
of
mortals
he
instinctively
obeys
the
impulses
of
natural
feeling
and
produces
a
perfect
work
of
art
he
has
hardly
read
a
poem
or
a
play
or
seen
any
thing
of
the
world
but
he
hears
the
anxious
beatings
of
his
own
heart
and
makes
others
feel
them
by
the
force
of
sympathy
ignorant
alike
of
rules
regardless
of
models
he
follows
the
steps
of
truth
and
simplicity
and
strength
proportion
and
delicacy
are
the
infallible
results
by
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
subject
he
rivets
the
attention
of
the
audience
to
it
all
his
dialogue
tends
to
action
all
his
situations
form
classic
groups
there
is
no
doubt
that
virginius
is
the
best
acting
tragedy
that
has
been
produced
on
the
modern
stage
knowles
himself
was
a
player
at
one
time
and
this
circumstance
has
probably
enabled
him
to
judge
of
the
picturesque
and
dramatic
effect
of
his
lines
as
we
think
it
might
have
assisted
shakespear
there
is
no
impertinent
display
no
flaunting
poetry
the
writer
immediately
conceives
how
a
thought
would
tell
if
he
had
to
speak
it
himself
knowles
is
the
first
tragic
writer
of
the
age
in
other
respects
he
is
a
common
man
and
divides
his
time
and
his
affections
between
his
plots
and
his
between
the
muses
spring
and
those
which
sparkle
like
his
own
eye
that
gush
out
like
his
own
voice
at
the
sight
of
an
old
friend
we
have
known
him
almost
from
a
child
and
we
must
say
he
appears
to
us
the
same
that
he
ever
was
he
has
been
cradled
in
song
and
rocked
in
it
as
in
a
dream
forgetful
of
himself
and
of
the
world
the
end
